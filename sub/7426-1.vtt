<i># You heard 'bout the legend
of Jesse James</i>

00:58.350 --> 01:00.811
<i># And John Henry
just to mention some names</i>

01:00.978 --> 01:04.355
<i># Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend
in the South today</i>

01:04.522 --> 01:07.985
<i># A man called Bandit
from Atlanta, Ga.</i>

01:08.151 --> 01:10.779
<i># Every gearjammer
knows his name</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:14.157
<i># They swear he got asphalt
a- runnin' in his veins</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:17.119
<i># A foot like lead

ridin' 18 wheels</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:22.749
<i># Oh, boy</i>

01:22.916 --> 01:26.211
<i># He left Atlanta back in '63</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:29.089
<i># Haulin' him a load
up to Tennessee</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:32.259
<i># He hit Mount Eagle
in a drivin' rain</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:35.220
<i># So hard he couldn't even see
the passin' lane</i>

01:35.387 --> 01:38.515
<i># Well, he started down the grade
when he lost a gear</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:42.060
<i># He hit them brakes,
found he had no air</i>

01:42.227 --> 01:44.938
<i># The Mount Eagle grade
is steep and long</i>

01:45.105 --> 01:48.817
<i># And everybody that seen it
thought the Bandit was gone</i>

01:48.984 --> 01:50.402
<i># All gone</i>

01:50.569 --> 01:53.947
<i># Well, his truck jack-knifed
turned completely around</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:57.034
<i># He was comin' down backwards
'bout the speed of sound</i>

01:57.201 --> 02:00.078
<i># A lot of folks seen him
and they all say</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:03.290
<i># He had his head out the window
yellin', "Clear the way!"</i>

02:03.457 --> 02:06.335
<i># Well, he got to the bottom
safe and sound</i>

02:06.502 --> 02:09.338
<i># Everybody asked Bandit
how he made it down</i>

02:09.505 --> 02:12.466
<i># He said, "Folks, when the truck
picked up too much speed</i>

02:12.633 --> 02:16.428
<i># "I just run along beside it
and drug my feet"</i>

02:16.595 --> 02:19.681
<i># Ya heard the legend
of Jesse James</i>

02:19.848 --> 02:22.017
<i># And John Henry

02:22.184 --> 02:25.646

02:48.126 --> 02:50.045
<i># Talk to me, guitar #</i>

03:02.891 --> 03:04.726
Hey, Kirk. How ya doin'?

03:04.893 --> 03:07.145
Tod Engels. How are ya?

03:09.898 --> 03:13.861
- This your rig, son?
- Yeah.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.446
Open it up. Let's see the manifest.

03:25.122 --> 03:29.751
Well, placin' you under arrest
for transportin' alcoholic beverages

03:29.918 --> 03:32.337
across state lines
without the proper permits.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.840
And that means you,
you dumb cowboy.

03:35.007 --> 03:38.677
You know truckin' Coors beer
east of Texas is bootleggin'.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.514
- This here's Georgia, son.
- Just a friendly bet.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.184
These two old boys put me up to it.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.394
Now, when ya gonna learn?

03:47.561 --> 03:52.149
Big and Little Enos Burdette make that
same bet with every gearjammer they can.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.276
I say he ain't gonna go
for your game.

03:54.443 --> 03:59.031
Son, from what I've heard, the biggest
thing about the Bandit is his ego,

03:59.198 --> 04:04.620
and I figure that, plus a lot of my dollars,
and he'll try anything, legal or not.

04:04.786 --> 04:09.374
<i>They've put on quite a show
for us today, haven't they, friends?</i>

04:09.541 --> 04:15.005
<i>Yes, sir, you have seen some of
the finest gearjammin' in all of this country.</i>

04:15.172 --> 04:20.302
<i>Remember, these are the boys that take
the long hauls. They really did it today.</i>

04:23.013 --> 04:27.059
- Hoss... Where might I find the Bandit?
- I ain't seen him.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.353
- Over there behind his rig.
- Who wants to see him?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.355
- Who's askin'?
- I'm askin'.

04:31.522 --> 04:35.692
'Cause I'm the guy payin' him $25 a day
so all his loyal fans can look at him.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.612
Do it.

04:38.779 --> 04:43.659
I'm buyin' your attraction
for a half an hour.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.459
Egotistical son of a bitch.

04:52.626 --> 04:58.006
A guy that paints his truck like this would go
to a minister's funeral dressed in feathers.

04:58.173 --> 05:03.387
See, son? Old legends
never die. They just lose weight.

05:03.554 --> 05:07.683
Seems like a legend and an out-of-work
bum look a lot alike, Daddy.

05:07.850 --> 05:11.895
Bandit, me and my son are here.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.027
Oh, I love your suits.

05:19.194 --> 05:23.866
It must be a bitch gettin' a size
68 extra-fat and a 12 dwarf.

05:24.032 --> 05:29.037
I came to make a deal. What's he get
if he wins this truck rodeo thing?

05:29.204 --> 05:32.166
- If?!
- $5,000, Daddy.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.878
- Chicken-shit money.
- Just what the hell you want, anyway?

05:36.044 --> 05:40.591
You to get out of this dumb-ass rodeo
and accept a real challenge.

05:45.804 --> 05:51.059
Gettin' to Texarkana and back
in 28 hours, that's no problem.

05:51.226 --> 05:55.606
- It ain't never been done before, hotshit.
- Watch your language, little lady.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.150
The problem is that Coors beer.

05:58.317 --> 06:02.821
You take that east of Texas
and that's, uh... that's bootleggin'.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.699
I believe you're just a little bit scared.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.952
Great psychology. Why don't you say
somethin' bad about my mother?

06:09.119 --> 06:12.372
- Your mama is so ugly...
- Look, you make this run for me.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.125
These Peterbilts are worth $80,000.

06:15.292 --> 06:20.756
That comes to about three grand
an hour if you make it in 28 hours.

06:20.923 --> 06:23.258
How about that for a challenge?

06:23.425 --> 06:25.969
- Dad, I don't believe that that's necess...
- Never mind.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.680
Wait a minute. Why do you
want that beer so bad?

06:28.847 --> 06:31.517
Because he's thirsty, dummy.

06:31.683 --> 06:35.270
You see, I got a boy runnin' tomorrow
in the Southern Classic.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.649
When he wins,
I wanna celebrate in style.

06:38.815 --> 06:43.070
- How much style?
- Well, I got a few friends and me.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.947
400 cases.

06:45.113 --> 06:49.159
- 400 cases...?
- Well?

06:49.326 --> 06:53.288
- Well, let me see your cash.
- Big Enos's word is gold.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.626
All right, show him the cash.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.087
- Go ahead, Little.
- Shit.

07:02.297 --> 07:05.801
Let's see. There's 400 cases of beer,
I'll need the cash for that.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.971
No problem. Go ahead, boy.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.266
New car. Gotta have a new car
to block for the truck.

07:12.432 --> 07:18.730
- OK. Go ahead, boy.
- I'd like to kick his ass just once.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.858
Speedy car.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.487
Speedier than that.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.489
Go ahead.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.596
- Hello, darlin'.
- Hi, Uncle Bandit.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.848
- Which one of the house apes are you?
- Kate.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.309
He's droppin' 'em like flies, isn't he?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.520
Well, well, well. Hello, beautiful.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.356
- How about 'gorgeous'?
- You can't have him.

08:01.523 --> 08:04.401
Obviously you can. What are you
tryin' to do, start another race?

08:04.568 --> 08:08.030
Look, you got Cledus in jail once.
Leave us alone!

08:08.197 --> 08:10.490
- Hi, Uncle Bandit!
- He ain't your damn uncle!

08:10.657 --> 08:15.871
I always recognise you! You know why?
You always kick me in the balls!

08:16.038 --> 08:18.832
Damn it, Bandit! Look at me!

08:18.999 --> 08:23.545
I find it hard to look at you, Waynette,
especially with those things in your hair.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.131
Makes me think you're listening
to a radio station in Savannah.

08:26.298 --> 08:30.052
You can't go in there and bother Cledus.
Hey! This is my home!

08:30.219 --> 08:32.513
- Cledus.
- No!

08:32.679 --> 08:36.390
I know in the past
I may have done you wrong.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.602
- Right?
- Right.

08:39.770 --> 08:44.900
However, in the future, Cledus,
I will never, ever do you wrong again.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.528
- Right?
- Right.

08:48.445 --> 08:54.660
We have a big chance, a big chance
to make a run for some big bucks.

08:55.327 --> 08:59.790
- 80,000 of them.
- Really?

08:59.957 --> 09:04.169
- Are we gonna kidnap the Pope or somethin'?
- How'd you guess?

09:04.336 --> 09:09.132
No. We're just gonna run over to Texarkana
and pick up 400 cases of Coors

09:09.299 --> 09:12.010
and bring it back in 28 hours.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.638
Whoa! I got a flash for you.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.599
That's called bootleggin',
and that's against the law.

09:17.766 --> 09:21.395
Who gives a turkey when the Snowman
and the Bandit are runnin' the booze?

09:21.562 --> 09:24.147
- No one can stop us.
- Hold it right there.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.234
There ain't gonna be no more
Snowman and Bandit.

09:27.401 --> 09:32.614
Because I've got to go in the morning
to Conyers and pick up a load of manure.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.701
- Shitty job.
- Can I ask you a question?

09:35.868 --> 09:37.536
Sure. Ask me.

09:37.703 --> 09:40.747
What the hell do we wanna go to
Texas for and haul beer back here?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.000
For the good old American life.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.628
For the money, for the glory
and for the fun.

09:46.795 --> 09:50.090
Mostly for the money. You know
what we're gonna do with the money?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.885
- What?
- We're gonna buy a new rig.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.471
- You're crazy, you know that.
- Yeah.

09:56.638 --> 10:00.309
- How much money did you say it was?
- $80,000.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.686
$80,000?

10:02.853 --> 10:04.730
- Hm.
- Waynette!

10:04.938 --> 10:09.193
Now, Bo, I'm tellin' ya,
Fred here ain't gonna be no problem.

10:09.359 --> 10:13.572
- I can see he'll be a major asset.
- Besides, he's one hellacious watchdog.

10:13.739 --> 10:17.117
- Well, let's get goin'.
- Whoa. Hold it a minute.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.662
I got to ask you a question.
Sit right there, Fred.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.999
You mean to tell me
we're gonna drive from here

10:24.166 --> 10:27.503
to Texarkana, Texas,
and back to here in 28 hours?

10:27.669 --> 10:30.255
It's only 900 miles there
and 900 miles back.

10:30.422 --> 10:34.009
Well, for your information,
that ain't never been done, not in no rig.

10:34.176 --> 10:38.347
'Cause you and I never done it in no rig.
You gotta stop thinkin' so negative.

10:38.514 --> 10:41.433
'Course we can make it.
We ain't never not made it yet, have we?

10:41.600 --> 10:44.353
- Well, no.
- You see? There you are.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.689
Yeah. Yeah, I see. I see all right.

10:47.856 --> 10:52.194
I see our asses in a sling
if we get caught, that's what I see.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.700
Hey! Ho-ho-ho!

10:58.867 --> 11:02.454
Well, God Almighty,
would you look at that!

11:02.621 --> 11:05.541
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Honey, hush.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.671
I don't guess we're gonna be ridin'
in the truck together this time?

11:10.838 --> 11:13.465
No, son. I'll be drivin' this one
and blockin'.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.301
You'll be drivin' the truck.
This is Bandit One and that is...

11:16.468 --> 11:18.762
...Bandit Two. Together again.

11:18.929 --> 11:23.350
- Like Fred and Ginger and Lester and Earl.
- That's right. But we got a problem.

11:24.226 --> 11:27.312
You know them Smokeys
got them CBs in the car now.

11:27.479 --> 11:31.358
I haven't worked that out yet,
but I'm thinkin' about it.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.819
I got an idea.
Why don't we do this?

11:33.986 --> 11:38.073
If I say go to channel 21, forget it.
We ain't goin' to 21, we're goin' to 19.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.994
- 21 is 19?
- If I say go to channel six, forget it.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.913
- We go to three.
- I go to three. Perfect.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.083
- If I say go to channel two, we go to one.
- Two is one.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.502
- That'll confuse everybody.
- That'll confuse 'em.

11:50.669 --> 11:54.047
On the other hand,
if we stayed on the odd channels,

11:54.214 --> 11:57.134
switched every time and started
in the basement, that'd work, too.

11:57.301 --> 12:01.847
- That'd do it, too, wouldn't it?
- Well, yeah, that'd work too, I guess.

12:02.014 --> 12:05.142
- Let's haul ass.
- OK.

12:26.955 --> 12:30.918
Breaker One. This is the Bandit.
Is the Snowman out there?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.587
<i>- Am I hittin'ya, son?
- Mercy sakes.</i>

12:33.754 --> 12:36.798
You put about eight and a half on me,
blowin' my windows out. Bring it on.

12:36.965 --> 12:41.553
I'll be within earshot.
You keep it wound up to around 90.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.307
<i>- Hey, Bandit. Me and Fred's got a question.
- What do you and Fred want?</i>

12:45.474 --> 12:48.977
How come we're doing this?
They said it couldn't be done.

12:49.144 --> 12:52.189
- That's the reason.
- That's good with Fred!

12:53.106 --> 12:54.525
10-4.

12:54.816 --> 12:58.445
<i># Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'</i>

12:58.612 --> 13:01.532

<i># And he ain't gonna rest

14:12.603 --> 14:14.813

you've got to duck him</i>

14:17.107 --> 14:20.444
<i># Just put that hammer down

14:20.611 --> 14:22.946
Well, hello there, Smokey.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.498
<i># Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'</i>

14:32.664 --> 14:35.792
<i># We gonna do what they say
can't be done</i>

14:35.959 --> 14:40.464
<i># We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there</i>

14:40.631 --> 14:44.134
<i># I'm westbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run</i>

14:44.301 --> 14:48.388
<i># Keep your foot hard on the pedal,
son, never mind them brakes</i>

14:48.555 --> 14:51.975
<i># Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make</i>

14:52.142 --> 14:55.896
<i># The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana</i>

14:56.063 --> 15:00.275
<i># And we'll bring it back
no matter what it takes</i>

15:00.442 --> 15:04.321
<i># Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'</i>

15:04.488 --> 15:07.491
<i># We gonna do what they say
can't be done</i>

15:07.658 --> 15:11.995
<i># We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there</i>

15:12.162 --> 15:16.124
<i># I'm westbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run</i>

15:21.463 --> 15:24.800
Fred, I hope me and you
ain't lettin' Bandit

15:24.967 --> 15:28.095
talk us into somethin'
we gonna be sorry for, son,

15:28.262 --> 15:30.764
'cause he's about as crazy
as you are ugly.

15:47.698 --> 15:51.201
<i># Westbound and down
18 wheels a-rollin'</i>

15:51.368 --> 15:54.371
<i># We gonna do what they say
can't be done</i>

15:54.538 --> 15:59.001
<i># We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there</i>

15:59.168 --> 16:03.297
<i># I'm westbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run #</i>

16:33.660 --> 16:36.538
- Big town, ain't it?
- I wonder what they do for excitement.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.041
They probably sit around
and watch the cars rust.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.503
- Damn it, it's locked.
- We're about an hour ahead of schedule.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.714
- Let's keep it that way.
- All right.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.352
Hey, want a beer?

16:58.519 --> 17:01.396
- Well, son!
- Redneck heaven.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.233
- How we gonna load all this stuff, though?
- I'll load it with this.

17:04.398 --> 17:08.153
- You can't drive no forklift.
- I can drive any forkin' thing around.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.031
- Get serious! Can you drive this thing?
- I am serious.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.784
- Crank it up. Now back it up.
- Oh, shut up!

17:13.951 --> 17:18.914
- I said back it up, not raise it up!
- I am backin' up, ya big dumbbell!

17:19.080 --> 17:21.834
Hold it! The beer! Watch the beer!

17:24.586 --> 17:28.257
- You all right?
- Very funny Very funny

17:28.423 --> 17:29.800
I thought it was funny.

17:30.342 --> 17:34.388
Hey, we really oughta pay somebody
for that mess we made in there.

17:34.555 --> 17:37.474
- All right, have you...
- I got that all worked out.

17:37.641 --> 17:41.645
You just leave a note. Tell the folks
to send the bill to Big Enos Burdette.

17:45.941 --> 17:53.782
"Send... bill... to... Big... Enos... Burdette. "

17:55.701 --> 17:58.745
Burdette. B...

17:58.912 --> 18:03.000
B- e-r... B-u-r... B...
Hell, I got to go.

18:07.004 --> 18:11.216
<i>Hey, Spiderman,
are you out there? Come back.</i>

18:11.383 --> 18:15.304
Snowman! How we doin', son?
Come on back.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.681
Hang on just a minute,
and I'll tell ya.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.020
We're about 28 minutes ahead of schedule.

18:23.187 --> 18:25.480
<i>- Come back.
- I hate to say I told you so.</i>

18:25.647 --> 18:29.151
Don't lose your head, son.
We still got a lot of boogiein' to do.

18:29.318 --> 18:32.613
Put the pedal to the metal.
I'm 10-10 on the side.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.533
For sure. Me and Fred,
we got your back door, ain't we, Fred?

18:46.710 --> 18:51.465
- Sorry. I don't want to get married.
- Terrific. That makes two of us.

18:52.132 --> 18:56.303
- Will you unzip me?
- Sure.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.890
- Does this thing move?
- Oh, yeah.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.890
Where are we going?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

19:42.057 --> 19:46.103
- We are a bride in search of a wedding.
- No.

19:46.270 --> 19:51.775
There is a wedding in search of a bride.
Let me put it another way.

19:51.942 --> 19:55.988
Think of it as a wedding posse
in search of a bride.

19:56.154 --> 20:00.367
- You understand that, cowboy?
- Yeah.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.288
What are ya doin'?

20:05.789 --> 20:08.000
- These are my shoes.
- Oh, yeah.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.794
- And these are my legs.
- Yeah.

20:10.961 --> 20:16.008
- What are you gonna do with them?
- With the shoes or the legs?

20:16.175 --> 20:19.761
Last time I saw legs like that,
they had a message tied to 'em.

20:19.928 --> 20:24.725
What do you mean? These are
great little legs. I'm a professional.

20:25.893 --> 20:30.397
Well, in that case,
you shouldn't be dressed in white.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.525
- Dancer.
- Oh.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.197
Well, cowboys love fat calves.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.743
- They're not fat.
- They're bigger than mine.

20:42.910 --> 20:46.705
- Do we really wanna talk about legs?
- One of us does.

20:46.872 --> 20:52.836
Otherwise we wouldn't have gone...
What are we doing now?

20:53.003 --> 20:56.632
Well, I am getting my clothes, you fool.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.636
Good idea. Why don't you
slip into somethin' comfortable?

21:03.889 --> 21:07.684
Are we really going 110?
We're going 110!

21:07.851 --> 21:11.897
Why do you wear that cowboy hat?
Because you think it looks dazzling on you.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.692
I'd no idea this dress
would be so hard to get out of.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.536
Hold up on that car wash, gentlemen.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.500
Come here, son.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.796
Whoops!

22:19.923 --> 22:23.218
You look tired, boy. Rest yourself.

22:25.804 --> 22:29.850
You punks look tuckered out, too.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.941
That's an attention-getter.

22:38.775 --> 22:42.863
- Now, a lady in a weddin' gown.
- Yes, sir.

22:43.864 --> 22:46.617
- Get in a car?
- Yes, sir.

22:46.783 --> 22:49.912
- See who was drivin'?
- N-no, sir.

22:52.289 --> 22:56.710
- Licence plate?
- Y-yes, sir. Georgia plates.

22:56.877 --> 22:58.670
"Ban-one. "

22:58.837 --> 23:03.342
B- A-N dash O-N-E.

23:03.509 --> 23:07.596
All right. Now, you boys
just stay here and watch the car.

23:07.763 --> 23:11.016
There might be some vandals around
who wanna steal somethin',

23:11.183 --> 23:14.394
so you boys just stay here
and keep your hands on the car

23:14.561 --> 23:18.273
until one of my associates arrive.

23:18.440 --> 23:25.155
And don't go home, don't go to eat,
and don't play with yourself.

23:25.322 --> 23:28.492
It wouldn't look nice on my highway.

23:28.659 --> 23:34.915
Oh, you can think about it,
but don't do it.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.599
Hey, man, he's gone.
Let's get outta here.

23:52.766 --> 23:56.812
Shit! You do what you want.
I'm stayin' right here.

24:00.899 --> 24:05.070
28 years old and... Oh, goodness,
what's this? I'll tuck it right in.

24:05.237 --> 24:08.699
I was down here dancing
in a home appliance show.

24:08.866 --> 24:11.952
<i>- I danced around three trash mashers.
- Talk to me, my boy.</i>

24:12.119 --> 24:16.165
I had this costume that lit up.
I only short-circuited once.

24:16.331 --> 24:20.919
- Where did you get that seat cover, son?
- This ain't no seat cover.

24:21.086 --> 24:24.756
- I was standing in the parking lot...
- I'm sitting next to Lawrence of Arabia.

24:24.923 --> 24:29.636
I met this guy... These can't be my pants.
God, he was good-looking.

24:29.803 --> 24:32.181
- And he had this hat on...
- Funny, ain't she?

24:32.347 --> 24:37.436
I think he was from Texas or something,
and I thought, "Why not marry the guy?"

24:41.064 --> 24:44.610
Nobody walks out
on a pretty weddin' I set up.

24:44.776 --> 24:47.404
I'm gonna get that girl
and set everything straight.

24:47.571 --> 24:53.160
She insulted my town.
She insulted my son.

24:55.287 --> 24:59.500
- Look, what if we...
- Shut up! She insulted my authority.

25:00.876 --> 25:06.465
And that's nothin' but pure and simple
old-fashioned Communism.

25:06.632 --> 25:10.177
It happens every time one of those
dancers starts poontangin' around...

25:10.344 --> 25:12.429
with those show-folk fags.

25:12.596 --> 25:15.349
Halfway down the aisle I said to myself,

25:15.516 --> 25:18.101
"Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
His mother doesn't even have any teeth!"

25:18.268 --> 25:21.396
I jumped in this car, and it blew up
on the side of the road,

25:21.563 --> 25:24.733
and I ended up in this goddamn airplane.
What do you do?

25:25.400 --> 25:28.028
I don't remember.

25:28.195 --> 25:32.699
- Oh, are we on the air?
- Sort of, yeah.

25:34.201 --> 25:37.830
You think I'm... nuts, don't you?

25:37.996 --> 25:40.415
No, I don't think you're crazy.

25:40.582 --> 25:45.128
I picked up three brides yesterday,
just like you, very subdued.

25:45.295 --> 25:48.590
Hey, what... what's goin' on up there?

25:49.007 --> 25:51.677
<i>- Come back, Bandit.
- Bandit?</i>

25:51.844 --> 25:57.850
- Is that your name or your profession?
- That's my handle. Bo's my real name.

25:58.016 --> 26:00.519
- What's your name?
- Carrie.

26:00.686 --> 26:04.356
Is she wearing a wedding dress?

26:07.025 --> 26:08.402
She was.

26:08.569 --> 26:12.155
What's she wearin' now?
Come back.

26:12.322 --> 26:15.242
Hey, you got peanut butter
or somethin' in your ears?

26:15.409 --> 26:19.705
Tell me what that woman's got on...
her mind!

26:20.539 --> 26:21.915
10-4!

26:22.082 --> 26:26.003
No coozie's gonna leave me
at no church.

26:26.170 --> 26:29.840
Decoratin' up a whole town
at a cost of $40.

26:30.007 --> 26:32.551
Right.

26:33.760 --> 26:39.558
I can see her now,
runnin' back up that aisle...

26:39.725 --> 26:43.020
No, she was dancin'
back up the aisle,

26:43.187 --> 26:46.148
her knockers bouncin'
all over the joint.

26:47.024 --> 26:49.443
Let go of that wheel.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.488
Why, her ass was wigglin', too.

26:58.160 --> 27:01.830
Why so fast?
You're late for a big bowling date?

27:01.997 --> 27:03.540
Cute.

27:06.210 --> 27:11.131
- So, tell me about yourself.
- What do you wanna know, my sign?

27:11.298 --> 27:15.344
- What do you do besides drive fast?
- Have fun.

27:15.511 --> 27:18.889
- Is this fun?
- Drivin'?

27:19.056 --> 27:23.936
- Driving, talking to me.
- They're both a challenge.

27:25.646 --> 27:30.442
- You've got a great profile.
- Yeah, don't I? Especially from the side.

27:31.109 --> 27:33.487
At least we finally agree on something.

27:33.654 --> 27:37.074
Yeah. We both like half my face.

27:42.996 --> 27:46.583
Hey, would a cop taking a leak
on the side of the road interest you?

27:48.043 --> 27:50.420
Yes, it would.

27:50.587 --> 27:56.385
- He's taking a 10-100.
- At least it's better than a 10-200.

28:00.597 --> 28:02.516
- Smokey.
- Smokey.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.879
- Is this fun?
- I forgot to tell ya:

28:32.045 --> 28:35.424
I'm runnin' blocker for 400 cases
of illegal Coors.

28:52.024 --> 28:53.859
Holy shit!

28:56.153 --> 29:00.032
I don't believe this.
Funny, I don't remember that turn.

29:00.199 --> 29:04.495
<i>- Bandit, where the hell are you?
- I'll be back on the highway in a second.</i>

29:04.661 --> 29:06.914
<i>All right, good buddy.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.</i>

29:20.802 --> 29:24.681
- Them things are fabulous.
- I think I just went 10-100.

29:24.848 --> 29:29.061
- Well, it's better than 10-200.
- That's true.

29:36.193 --> 29:40.239
<i># Well, the more wheels I got
the better I like it.</i>

29:40.405 --> 29:44.660
<i># I'm the brother of a truck-driving mother
boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity. #</i>

29:48.914 --> 29:52.376
- Snowman, you got your ears on?
- You lucky devil, you got him.

29:52.543 --> 29:55.963
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm on a two-lane blacktop.

29:56.129 --> 30:00.676
Highway marker number 71.
How's our time doin'?

30:01.677 --> 30:06.974
Oh, how are we doin' on time?
About 25 minutes ahead of schedule.

30:07.140 --> 30:11.144
- What's your 20?
- I'm about four miles ahead of you, turkey.

30:11.311 --> 30:12.813
Not for long.

30:12.980 --> 30:18.151
<i>- Breaker to the Bandit.
- Come on back, breaker.</i>

30:18.694 --> 30:22.239
<i>Bandit, I've got a smokey report
for you. Come on.</i>

30:22.406 --> 30:26.243
<i>- Well, talk to me, good buddy.
- You've got trouble comin'.</i>

30:26.410 --> 30:29.955
Well, what's your handle, son,
and, uh, what's your 20?

30:30.122 --> 30:36.128
<i>My handle's Smokey Bear,
and I'm tail-grabbin'your ass right now.</i>

30:38.630 --> 30:43.135
Goddamn. That's a Texas mountie.
What the hell's he doin' in Arkansas?

30:43.302 --> 30:47.014
Well, let's just see what
he's got under the hood.

30:47.181 --> 30:48.891
Bye-bye, baby!

31:02.362 --> 31:04.740
You smoke much?

31:04.907 --> 31:07.326
I just started.

31:10.787 --> 31:15.167
<i>- Cledus, you got your ears on, son?
- Oh, bring it on, you lucky devil.</i>

31:15.334 --> 31:17.503
- Comin' around you.
- Be careful.

31:17.669 --> 31:21.340
You're gonna have to make your own lane,
'cause you definitely got oncoming traffic.

31:21.507 --> 31:22.883
Be careful. Be careful.

31:30.265 --> 31:32.893
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

31:33.060 --> 31:36.939
I'm about to be killed in this...
in this moving CB radio show,

31:37.105 --> 31:40.734
and I... I don't even have a handle!

31:41.360 --> 31:45.614
You want a handle?
OK, I'll think one up for ya. Let's see.

31:45.781 --> 31:48.075
- Oh, I got one for ya!
- What?

31:50.577 --> 31:52.663
Just give me a minute here.

31:54.373 --> 31:56.416
He done good, didn't he, Fred?

32:02.047 --> 32:03.882
What?

32:04.049 --> 32:05.759
Frog.

32:06.969 --> 32:10.097
- Why?
- 'Cause you're always hoppin' around.

32:10.264 --> 32:14.726
And you're kinda cute like a frog,
and... I'd like to jump ya.

32:17.896 --> 32:19.857
Nobody...

32:20.023 --> 32:25.237
Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice
look like a possum's pecker.

32:25.404 --> 32:28.532
- Except for that...
- Shut your ass.

32:32.619 --> 32:36.373
- Break for that, Bandit One.
- Yeah, Snowman, come on back.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.876
That was a Texas bubblegum machine
on your back door.

32:39.042 --> 32:42.629
- A Texas bubblegum machine?
- Yeah, I saw him.

32:54.933 --> 32:59.605
You ain't gonna believe this, but that crazy
sombitch tried to drive up under my truck.

32:59.771 --> 33:02.733
What's a Texas county mountie
doing in Arkansas?

33:02.900 --> 33:05.569
<i>- I don't know.
- I don't know.</i>

33:05.736 --> 33:08.030
I don't know!

33:08.197 --> 33:12.034
- Well, who the hell knows?
- I really don't know.

33:14.411 --> 33:20.918
What we're dealin' with here is
a complete lack of respect for the law.

33:21.752 --> 33:25.506
<i>This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.</i>

33:25.672 --> 33:29.009
<i>I'm in pursuit of a black TransAm.</i>

33:29.176 --> 33:33.722
<i>He's all mine, so stay outta the way.</i>

33:42.105 --> 33:45.317
This is Sheriff George Branford
of Deeson County, Arkansas.

33:45.484 --> 33:48.737
We are apprised of the situation
and are taking appropriate measures.

33:48.904 --> 33:50.489
Did you say you are a sheriff?

33:50.656 --> 33:54.034
That's a big 10-4!

33:54.201 --> 33:58.080
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice
of Texas!

33:58.247 --> 34:01.834
Texas? You know, of course,
that you're out of your jurisdiction.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.419
I suggest that you let my department
handle the situation.

34:04.586 --> 34:09.382
That's very comfortin',
but I'm in a high-speed pursuit.

34:09.550 --> 34:12.386
- Don't you hear good?
- I hear perfectly.

34:12.553 --> 34:15.222
The fact that you are a sheriff
is not germane to the situation.

34:15.389 --> 34:19.101
The goddamn Germans
got nothin' to do with it!

34:19.268 --> 34:21.311
- What?
- Shut up! One shit at a time!

34:27.609 --> 34:31.989
- What do ya see?
- We lost him.

34:39.913 --> 34:43.083
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice again.

34:43.250 --> 34:46.712
I lost that TransAm.
Set up a roadblock.

34:46.879 --> 34:49.590
- Good idea!
- What the hell you know?

34:49.755 --> 34:52.801
I believe we have the situation
well under control, Sheriff.

34:57.014 --> 34:59.725
<i>Breaker, breaker, lookin' for the Bandit.</i>

34:59.892 --> 35:02.811
<i>- You out there, son?
- You got the Bandit. Come on back.</i>

35:02.978 --> 35:08.317
My handle's Silver-Tongued Devil. Your fellow
CBers are mighty proud of ya out there.

35:08.483 --> 35:10.486
Thank ya, son. I appreciate it.

35:10.652 --> 35:14.072
Tell me, you comin' up
on Fayetteville and Interstate 82?

35:14.239 --> 35:18.619
- We're almost on top of it.
- I got a big bad bear story for you there.

35:18.785 --> 35:21.455
I just rolled past
a county mountie roadblock.

35:21.622 --> 35:26.543
- You ARE a silver-tongued devil.
- That's a big 10-4, good buddy.

35:26.710 --> 35:31.548
Well, you keep your wheels spinnin'
and the beavers grinnin', then. I'm out.

35:31.715 --> 35:34.259
Why, thank you, Officer.

35:34.426 --> 35:36.887
- Classy guy.
- Classy guy.

36:00.577 --> 36:03.580
Did you see that? They went
right through our roadblock.

36:03.747 --> 36:06.375
You sombitches couldn't
close an umbrella.

36:36.321 --> 36:40.826
You know somethin', Sheriff? If J.W.
Don't get out of my way, I'll pass him.

36:40.993 --> 36:43.579
Where? In the woods?

36:43.745 --> 36:48.500
I don't care if your daddy is the mayor.
You wreck this car, it'll come outta your pay.

36:49.251 --> 36:52.754
- Yeah, but he's gettin' away.
- Son, he's not goin' anywhere.

36:52.921 --> 36:56.300
The Mulberry Bridge has been dismantled
for the past six months.

37:02.472 --> 37:04.725
That's not good.

37:09.688 --> 37:12.065
It would be better with a whole bridge.

37:13.233 --> 37:15.652
And that's worse.

37:18.989 --> 37:23.035
- Why don't you drop me off? I'll catch a cab.
- Too late now.

37:35.339 --> 37:37.216
We did it! We did it!

37:48.268 --> 37:50.354
See? I didn't wreck it, Sheriff.

37:53.524 --> 37:55.359
We jumped over that bridge!

37:55.526 --> 37:58.362
- Did you see what we did?
- Yes, I did.

37:58.529 --> 38:02.449
I wanna jump something else! I wanna
jump a house! I wanna jump something!

38:02.616 --> 38:04.618
Well, jump me.

38:06.912 --> 38:11.625
- Honest to God, it wasn't my fault! I stopped!
- Yeah, right.

38:11.792 --> 38:15.379
Hey, boy, where's Sheriff Branford?

38:16.296 --> 38:19.550
<i>I am Sheriff Branford.</i>

38:20.843 --> 38:25.097
Oh, hey...
For some reason or another,

38:25.264 --> 38:29.685
you sounded a little taller on radio.

38:34.439 --> 38:38.735
What the hell is
the world comin' to?

38:46.910 --> 38:50.330
<i>Sounds good to me,
Tower of Power. Listen, buddy...</i>

38:50.497 --> 38:52.958
- What channel we on?
- What?

38:53.125 --> 38:57.129
- What channel are we on?
- 11.

38:58.130 --> 38:59.756
Snowman, are you out there?

38:59.923 --> 39:04.344
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to be doin'.
What are y'all doing, he'n' and she'n'?

39:04.511 --> 39:07.264
- Come back.
- Oh, we were playin' a little bridge.

39:07.431 --> 39:12.394
- How we been doin'?
- We're losin' minutes, son.

39:12.561 --> 39:18.025
If you don't get up here and run me some
interference, we ain't never gonna make it.

39:18.192 --> 39:23.030
I'll drop the dolly off at a choke-and-puke,
and then I'll get right back on the job.

39:23.197 --> 39:26.200
All right.
10-4 on that choke-and-puke.

39:26.366 --> 39:29.203
<i>- Oh, by the way, Bandit...
- Yeah, guy?</i>

39:29.369 --> 39:32.998
How 'bout bringin' me a hamburger for Fred?
I'm beginnin' to worry about him.

39:33.165 --> 39:36.084
<i>- He's lookin' a little thin in the skin.
- You got 'em.</i>

39:36.251 --> 39:39.922
- Choke-and-puke.
- Choke-and-puke.

39:40.088 --> 39:43.759
- That's where I'll get off?
- Right.

39:46.845 --> 39:49.348
You oughta give up smokin'.
That's bad for your health.

39:49.515 --> 39:52.601
But I enjoy it so much.

40:09.117 --> 40:13.539
I guess you can get
your ticket over there.

40:13.956 --> 40:16.083
- You got enough money?
- Yeah.

40:16.250 --> 40:20.254
I have enough to get to Jersey,
walk the rest of the way.

40:22.422 --> 40:27.386
- Hey, thanks.
- Oh, it was nothing.

40:28.762 --> 40:31.765
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

40:34.935 --> 40:37.229
Frog?

40:39.314 --> 40:41.066
You gonna be all right?

40:46.655 --> 40:50.659
Yeah... I'm always all right.

41:03.213 --> 41:07.259
Can I have a couple of cheeseburgers
to go and a glass of iced tea?

41:15.601 --> 41:18.312
How much I owe ya, ma'am?

41:18.478 --> 41:20.939
- A dollar and a half.
- Keep the change.

41:21.106 --> 41:25.486
Just keep your eye out
for that Mr Bandit bastard!

41:27.863 --> 41:33.994
Let me have a diablo sandwich, a Dr Pepper.
Make it fast. I'm in a goddamn hurry.

41:34.161 --> 41:36.872
- You want somethin'?
- A hush puppy, Daddy.

41:37.039 --> 41:42.336
We got no time for that crap!
Dumb sombitch!

41:43.337 --> 41:46.590
- Diablo and Doc.
- Thank you, nice lady.

41:46.757 --> 41:50.886
- You must be in a hell of a hurry, Sheriff?
- You bet your ass on that, boy.

41:51.053 --> 41:56.141
Oh, you got a little mess there.
Let me help you get that off there...

41:56.308 --> 41:59.686
- Yeah, yeah. Much obliged.
- Yeah.

41:59.853 --> 42:02.773
Who ya chasin'?
Somebody chasin' you?

42:02.940 --> 42:04.650
Nobody chasin' me, boy.

42:04.817 --> 42:10.280
I been chasin' a goddamn maniac
all the way from Texarkana, Texas.

42:10.447 --> 42:13.575
Really?
What is he, a bank robber?

42:13.742 --> 42:16.370
Bank robber?

42:16.537 --> 42:21.583
Bank robbin' is baby shit
alongside of what this dude is doin'.

42:22.751 --> 42:24.920
Almost killed 20 law officers.

42:25.087 --> 42:28.966
Drivin' through people's backyards,
knockin' down mailboxes.

42:29.132 --> 42:32.594
He's got a broad in the car,
took her across the state line.

42:32.761 --> 42:35.055
That's the Mann Act.

42:35.222 --> 42:38.559
I don't think he's got her permission,
and that's kidnapping.

42:38.725 --> 42:41.562
- How's that for high jinks?
- Yeah.

42:43.939 --> 42:46.400
- What I owe?
- Oh, let me pay for it.

42:46.567 --> 42:49.987
- You're an officer of the law. I'd be honoured.
- Much obliged.

42:50.154 --> 42:53.657
- Where's the can? I gotta take a squirt.
- Right back there. Just used it.

42:59.163 --> 43:02.332
Hey! Hey!
What are you doin' in my car?

43:02.499 --> 43:05.127
- You're goin' the wrong way!
- Oh.

43:05.711 --> 43:07.588
- Hang on!
- What the hell are ya doin'?

43:07.754 --> 43:10.841
- Sheriff Justice is in there!
- I know! I know!

43:18.724 --> 43:21.351
- Thank you, nice lady.
- Sure thing.

43:27.065 --> 43:29.067
Yoo-hoo! Sheriff!

43:33.780 --> 43:35.574
Oh, boy.

43:37.784 --> 43:40.204
Nice ass.

43:47.461 --> 43:50.088
I didn't want to be dumped
at any old truck stop.

43:50.255 --> 43:54.343
- I wanted to stay with you.
- Well, why didn't you ask?

43:54.510 --> 43:58.514
You might've said no, and I have
a hard time handling rejections.

44:41.473 --> 44:44.518
We're gainin' on 'em.

44:44.685 --> 44:48.313
I think it'd be a good idea
if we changed places, don't you?

44:48.480 --> 44:52.317
You be a passenger for a while now.
Up, up... I'll just slide right...

44:52.484 --> 44:55.487
- Oh, you got my hair.
- Sorry. I'll slide right under.

44:55.654 --> 44:58.824
- Ooh, I don't know. Wait. Wait. Wait!
- I got it. I got it!

44:58.991 --> 45:00.367
- Wait a minute!
- Wait a minute!

45:00.534 --> 45:02.995
Hold it! I'm stuck here.
This is not workin'.

45:03.162 --> 45:07.291
- I got my foot on the...
- Goddamn it! I seen it in the movies!

45:17.342 --> 45:19.970
Oh, my God!

45:20.596 --> 45:24.474
Duck, or you're gonna
be talkin' outta your ass!

45:31.231 --> 45:35.819
- Daddy, the top came off.
- No shit

45:43.327 --> 45:45.871
Snowman! How are your vocal cords?

45:46.038 --> 45:50.709
Well, my vocal cords are fine.
I'm a little worried about Fred now.

45:50.876 --> 45:56.256
He's been gnawing everything, barkin' and
screamin'. He's turned into a stalk of bananas.

45:56.423 --> 46:00.344
- What's your 20?
- About 16 miles this side of Mississippi.

46:00.511 --> 46:04.515
Whoa, hold it. I just passed
another Kojak with a Kodak.

46:04.681 --> 46:08.769
This place is crawlin' with bears.
Where the hell are you? Come back.

46:08.936 --> 46:14.149
I'm still tryin' to get rid of that Texas County
mountie. I don't know what the hell he wants.

46:14.316 --> 46:19.196
You know what he wants. How would you like
to be the dude that handcuffs a legend?

46:19.363 --> 46:24.576
Give me five minutes, we'll put some moves
on that mother. I'll meet ya at Old Miss.

46:24.743 --> 46:27.996
You'd better hurry, or we can just kiss
that money goodbye. Understand?

46:28.163 --> 46:30.499
I read you loud and clear. 10-4.

46:30.666 --> 46:34.628
You got the one Snowman.
I'm eastbound and down.

46:34.795 --> 46:37.589
We gone, killer.

46:48.225 --> 46:51.520
That's the way I wanna go out.
Hey, man, watch it!

46:54.940 --> 46:58.152
- What the hell was that?
- A left, or half a 'u'.

46:58.318 --> 47:00.946
Well, please don't do it anymore.

47:03.407 --> 47:07.452
Hey, you know who that was?
Check this out.

47:07.619 --> 47:10.164
Bandit, this here's the Grave Robber.

47:10.330 --> 47:15.294
Put the pedal to the metal, and we'll hold
this county mountie as long as we can.

47:15.460 --> 47:18.046
- Well, go, girl, go!
- I'm goin'! I'm goin'!

47:18.213 --> 47:21.258
I've got the metal to the pedal,
and the thing to the floor...

47:49.369 --> 47:51.705
Damn, he had a lot of friends, didn't he?

47:51.872 --> 47:54.583
If they had cremated the son of a bitch,

47:54.750 --> 47:59.963
I could've been kickin' that Mr Bandit's
ass around the moon by now.

48:15.479 --> 48:17.731
Hold my hat!

48:17.898 --> 48:21.276
- My hat blew off, Daddy.
- I hope your goddamn head was in it.

48:24.655 --> 48:27.241
- OK. We're gonna switch.
- OK.

48:27.407 --> 48:31.411
I'm comin' over underneath you.
You just slide right on over.

48:31.662 --> 48:34.164
I think I'm in love with your belt buckle.

48:38.836 --> 48:41.588
Close. Colourful, but close.

48:51.849 --> 48:54.935
I like this seat better anyway.

48:55.102 --> 48:57.688
Yes, have a smoke. It seems to help.

48:58.605 --> 49:00.524
Come on, defence!

49:02.109 --> 49:03.777
Come on, Billy Ray, get tough!

49:03.944 --> 49:07.281
You know, I wanted to be
a high-fashion model once.

49:07.447 --> 49:12.578
But, hell, how long can you
model clothes for 8-year-olds? Boys.

49:12.744 --> 49:16.832
Besides that, my cheeks were too fat.
These cheeks, these.

49:18.584 --> 49:21.086
Aarghhh!

49:22.004 --> 49:25.382
- Oh, my goodness, we're airborne here.
- Jesus Christ!

49:25.549 --> 49:30.179
- Oh, look, a football game!
- There's kids! For Christ's sake, watch out!

49:30.345 --> 49:34.057
- Don't hit the kids!
- Get your hands off my wheel!

49:34.224 --> 49:36.768
Lean to the left, lean to the right...

49:47.696 --> 49:52.367
Stand up there and see if you can see
where the hell they went.

49:53.035 --> 49:57.498
- Can you see anything?
- It's a football game. Can we watch, Daddy?

49:57.664 --> 50:01.168
- You stay and watch. I'm goin' back!
- But, Daddy...

50:07.591 --> 50:11.553
<i># Bandit, you're reckless
and you live much too hard #</i>

50:11.720 --> 50:14.473
Oughta be in Nashville.

50:14.640 --> 50:18.185
<i>Snowman, are ya out there, son?
What's your 20? Where are you?</i>

50:19.311 --> 50:23.440
I'm at mile marker 85. Come back.

50:23.607 --> 50:26.527
<i>Son-of-a-gun! So am I!</i>

50:29.863 --> 50:34.284
Well, damned if ya ain't.
Damned if ya ain't.

50:54.179 --> 50:56.390
Cledus... This is Frog.

50:56.557 --> 50:59.309
Hello, Frog. I want you
to meet Fred, Frog.

50:59.476 --> 51:02.980
- This is for Fred.
- Frog, feed Fred.

51:03.147 --> 51:05.691
What's wrong with you? You were gonna
dump the chick at the truck stop.

51:05.858 --> 51:09.987
- I ran into complications.
- You always run into complications.

51:10.154 --> 51:13.323
Always the same, some chick.
We ain't doin' good time.

51:13.490 --> 51:17.035
- What are we yappin' for?
- It's the chick.

51:19.746 --> 51:22.916
- Switch down to the next channel, right?
- Yeah.

51:24.084 --> 51:27.171
Hey, Bandit? Nice ass.

51:27.337 --> 51:29.756
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks a lot.

51:39.308 --> 51:43.979
All right, Fred. Come on.
Let's go, boy. Come on.

51:44.146 --> 51:46.482
Fred, I'm tired of pickin' you up... Fred!

51:50.235 --> 51:54.156
- Did Cledus call you a legend?
- Uh-huh.

51:54.990 --> 52:00.078
- Why?
- Well, I used to do some crazy things.

52:00.245 --> 52:02.206
- I used to.
- Oh.

52:06.001 --> 52:07.461
So did I.

52:07.628 --> 52:12.674
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

52:12.841 --> 52:15.427
One, two... I'm a gypsy... four.

52:15.594 --> 52:20.182
That's someone who goes from chorus line
to chorus line... six, seven, eight.

52:22.226 --> 52:26.980
- You know, I was on Broadway once.
- Really?

52:27.147 --> 52:29.858
- For almost 12 minutes.
- Oh.

52:30.025 --> 52:32.569
The show closed the first night.

52:32.736 --> 52:38.617
But, God, I was so good. You shoulda
seen me. You'd have loved me.

52:44.832 --> 52:48.794
What do you do? Straight.

52:52.673 --> 52:58.220
I just go from place to place
and... do what I do best.

52:59.012 --> 53:02.182
- What's that?
- Show off.

53:06.228 --> 53:09.481
Yeah. You do do that well.

53:12.776 --> 53:14.778
You do.

53:15.988 --> 53:18.949
So do I.
Five, six, seven, eight.

53:19.116 --> 53:22.995
- For almost 12 minutes.
- Oh, shut up!

53:25.581 --> 53:30.127
Come here, Fred. Come here, boy.
Fred, don't you make me come after you.

53:30.878 --> 53:34.590
Get over here, Fred! Come here.

53:34.756 --> 53:39.636
I'm in a hurry, and you want to swim.
You're drivin' me crazy, Fred.

53:43.682 --> 53:49.771
What is the matter with you, Fred?
That's it for you and the truck drivin'!

53:58.238 --> 54:01.658
Look, I've got to go 10-100.
Could I have a dime?

54:01.825 --> 54:05.537
- Crawl under.
- Terrific.

54:05.704 --> 54:08.165
"Crawl under. "

54:15.005 --> 54:18.967
- TransAm! What's your pleasure?
- Fill it up, my man.

54:20.302 --> 54:22.638
Gimme that talker.

54:25.390 --> 54:28.227
Hello? Mr Bandit?

54:29.269 --> 54:32.189
<i>Would you just happen
to be listenin' out there?</i>

54:32.356 --> 54:34.107
Can you hear me, boy?

54:36.443 --> 54:38.904
This is the Bandit.
Who've I got at that end?

54:39.655 --> 54:42.991
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice
of Texas.

54:43.158 --> 54:46.578
Well, hot damn.
Welcome to Mississippi, Sheriff.

Now hear this, you tick turd:
I'm gonna get you.

55:07.140 --> 55:12.020
I didn't come all the way this far
to go home with empty pockets.

55:12.187 --> 55:15.649
I been meanin' to ask you that.
How come you're followin' me?

55:15.816 --> 55:19.444
I'd be delighted to tell you, Mr Bandit.

55:19.611 --> 55:24.116
You see, when I get you back home,

55:24.283 --> 55:28.162
I'm gonna find the tallest tree
in the country,

55:28.328 --> 55:33.041
<i>and then I'm gonna hang you from it.</i>

55:33.208 --> 55:35.752
- Sheriff?
- I'm listenin'.

55:35.919 --> 55:38.714
Do the letters F.O.
Mean anything to you?

55:42.593 --> 55:45.012
Smart aleck.

55:47.097 --> 55:49.433
You keep this one for yourself.

55:49.600 --> 55:54.396
- Have a smooth ride, Mr Bandit.
- Thank you, partner.

55:58.901 --> 56:00.652
Oof!

56:05.407 --> 56:07.117
<i>Snowman, I'm right beside you.</i>

56:07.284 --> 56:10.329
<i>Looks like we got a clear shot
all the way to the 'Bama state line.</i>

56:10.496 --> 56:15.209
<i>Oh, a clear shot?
I'm gonna believe that when I see it.</i>

56:15.375 --> 56:20.214
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice
puttin' out an all-point advisory.

56:20.380 --> 56:25.427
<i>That black TransAm is now
headed toward Alabama.</i>

56:26.261 --> 56:28.889
What happened, Daddy?

56:29.056 --> 56:32.142
Get back in the goddamn car.

56:36.188 --> 56:40.275
You know who I feel has revolutionised
the American musical theatre?

56:40.442 --> 56:43.403
- Stephen Sondheim.
- Yeah?

56:43.570 --> 56:46.240
- Who's that?
- Stephen Sondheim?

56:46.406 --> 56:49.326
- Does he do a lot of musicals and stuff?
- Yeah.

56:49.493 --> 56:52.663
- He ever do anything with Brenda Lee?
- Does she dance?

56:52.830 --> 56:56.667
- She spins. She's a little spinner.
- Oh, they were a good group.

56:56.834 --> 56:58.836
- The Spinners were good. Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:59.002 --> 57:01.213
Have you ever been in any plays?

57:01.380 --> 57:05.175
Holy shit. We got
a lot of company up there.

57:05.342 --> 57:07.386
A lot of company.

57:07.553 --> 57:10.889
- Sarge, here he comes.
- Yeah, I got eyes.

57:23.026 --> 57:26.905
- Are you ready, Roy?
- I was born ready.

57:27.072 --> 57:29.158
Don't just stand there. Go get him!

57:29.324 --> 57:33.871
- Drives pretty good, don't he, Sarge?
- We'll see about that.

57:51.972 --> 57:55.851
- Sarge, you OK?
- You see me movin', don't ya?

58:16.288 --> 58:20.792
- Wanna do a little pond hopping, Frog?
- Uh... Swell.

59:30.821 --> 59:33.740
Now, I know you're
in a little distress here,

59:33.907 --> 59:36.869
but did you see
a black TransAm go by?

59:37.035 --> 59:40.122
He caused all of this, the Bandit.
Ain't he somethin'?

59:41.748 --> 59:44.918
The Bandit ain't nothin'.
He's a mental case.

59:50.215 --> 59:52.342
Good shit!

59:53.427 --> 59:56.096
Banzai!

59:59.933 --> 01:00:02.644
I saw that, you sombitch!

01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:04.897
You did that on purpose!

01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:07.441
You're goin' away till you're grey!

01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:10.152
I got the evidence!
Put the evidence in the car.

01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:14.114
- But, Daddy...
- Put the evidence in the car!

01:00:14.281 --> 01:00:19.369
I'm gonna barbecue
your ass in molasses!

01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:28.504
Put the evidence in the back.

01:00:36.136 --> 01:00:39.890
There's no way, no way...

01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:43.811
that you could come from my loins.

01:00:45.103 --> 01:00:50.526
When I get home, the first thing I'm gonna
do is punch your mama in the mouth.

01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:03.956
I- I'll be with you
in a moment, young man.

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:08.460
Bandit, honey, this is the Good
Witch of the North speakin'.

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:11.171
You'd better not come this way.

01:01:11.338 --> 01:01:15.759
There's been a little
fender bender here on 64.

01:01:15.926 --> 01:01:19.471
- Snowman, you copy that?
- Yeah, I got a four on that.

01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:22.349
That'll work for me, 'cause I need to pull off,

01:01:22.516 --> 01:01:25.144
suck up a little go-go juice
and put some groceries down my neck.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:26.937
Y'all be careful
and I'll catch ya later.

01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:31.358
- One Snowman. I'm playin' on the side.
- We'll be 10-10 on the side.

01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:35.195
Lady, don't you know
you're supposed to signal?

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:37.197
Oh? Really?

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:52.588
<i># They call you the Bandit</i>

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:57.467
<i># An outlaw untamed</i>

01:01:57.634 --> 01:02:02.306
<i># Shackled only by freedom</i>

01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:05.350
<i># You wear no man's chain</i>

01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:09.855
We got some time.
You wanna stretch your legs, Frog?

01:02:10.022 --> 01:02:12.483
<i># Some say they despise you</i>

01:02:13.484 --> 01:02:18.447
<i># Well, maybe they do</i>

01:02:18.614 --> 01:02:23.118
<i># But deep down inside them</i>

01:02:23.285 --> 01:02:29.666
<i># I bet they wish they were you</i>

01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:46.725
Fill her up, hoss.

01:02:46.892 --> 01:02:50.687
Come on, Frederick.
Come on, boy, my boy.

01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:54.191
Let's go get some
of Lamar's greasy spoon.

01:02:54.358 --> 01:02:58.278
I'm gonna put you
on a diet, Fred. Mercy.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:05.327
Come on, Fred. Come on, boy.

01:03:05.494 --> 01:03:07.704
Inside.

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:10.040
Come on, boy.

01:03:10.207 --> 01:03:13.043
Lamar, surprise.
Look who's here.

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.170
- I knew you was comin'.
- Hi, Snowman.

01:03:15.337 --> 01:03:18.340
What do you mean,
you knew I was comin'?

01:03:25.264 --> 01:03:27.599
Lamar, you're rotten
to the core, you know that.

01:03:27.766 --> 01:03:30.519
About as rotten as that food
you've been poisonin' me with...

01:03:30.686 --> 01:03:34.106
- How many do you want?
- I don't know. Fix the same thing.

01:03:34.273 --> 01:03:36.525
Just cook the onions this time.

01:03:37.442 --> 01:03:41.029
- How have you been, Sugar Bear?
- Pretty good. You, Snowman?

01:03:41.196 --> 01:03:44.074
Oh, pretty good,
considering the shape I'm in.

01:03:44.241 --> 01:03:48.912
Say hello to Waynette.
Looks like old Fred's gettin' fat.

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:52.666
Yeah, tell me about it. It damn sure
ain't from eatin' the food at this joint.

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:56.003
- Tell me about that.
- I know it.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:04:00.340
By the way, where did you get
all them warthogs back there?

01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:03.177
Damn if I know. They slid
in here a little while ago.

01:04:03.343 --> 01:04:06.096
I'm gonna slide on out.
Catch you later, Snowman.

01:04:06.263 --> 01:04:09.433
Yeah, why don't you just leave me?

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.976
Yes, operator?

01:04:11.143 --> 01:04:15.063
This is a collect call
from Cledus Snow.

01:04:16.064 --> 01:04:19.610
No, I am not Hank Snow's brother. No.

01:04:22.738 --> 01:04:24.656
Hey, sugarbabe, how you doin'?

01:04:28.494 --> 01:04:31.330
- Could I ask you something?
- Sure.

01:04:33.624 --> 01:04:37.544
Do you think we have
anything in common?

01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:41.715
<i>Besides being chased around
the country in that feckuckteh car?</i>

01:04:41.882 --> 01:04:44.384
Yeah.

01:04:45.093 --> 01:04:47.137
Like what?

01:04:47.304 --> 01:04:50.599
<i>Have you ever seen
the Broadway show Chorus Line?</i>

01:04:50.766 --> 01:04:53.268
No.

01:04:53.435 --> 01:04:56.730
You like Elton John?

01:04:57.189 --> 01:04:58.941
No.

01:05:00.484 --> 01:05:03.862
- Do you know who Casey Tibbs is?
- Baseball player.

01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:08.450
- Close. Richard Petty?
- No.

01:05:08.784 --> 01:05:12.454
- Waylon Jennings? No.
- No.

01:05:14.456 --> 01:05:16.333
When you tell somebody somethin',

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.044
it depends on what part of
the United States you're standin' in...

01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:21.839
as to just how dumb you are.

01:05:26.301 --> 01:05:29.888
Mr Bandit, you have a lyrical way
of cutting through the bullshit.

01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:34.601
And you have a unique way with
the English language, Miss Frog.

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:42.818
<i># Bandit steals a lady's heart</i>

01:05:42.985 --> 01:05:46.238
<i># With only a smile</i>

01:05:46.864 --> 01:05:50.492
- Don't you take that hat off for anything?
- Sure.

01:05:50.659 --> 01:05:53.829
I take it off for one thing,
and one thing only.

01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:58.750
<i># And you live much too hard</i>

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:00.794
<i># Bandit, you're the joker</i>

01:06:00.961 --> 01:06:05.299
- If we were lost on a desert island together...
- Yes?

01:06:05.465 --> 01:06:12.264
Do you think we'd get along
and talk and... things?

01:06:13.182 --> 01:06:15.350
Sure.

01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:17.436
Yeah, we'd get along.

01:06:17.603 --> 01:06:23.192
It'd never be boring, I can tell you that.
It would never be boring.

01:06:24.526 --> 01:06:27.946
Take your hat off.

01:06:29.114 --> 01:06:31.909
If you want to.

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:37.372
<i># They call you the Bandit</i>

01:06:37.539 --> 01:06:40.000
I want to.

01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:48.091
<i># They call you the Bandit</i>

01:06:48.258 --> 01:06:52.596
<i># They call you the Bandit... #</i>

01:07:03.524 --> 01:07:07.569
- No. Honey, we'll be home in a little while.
- Hey!

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:11.031
Is this your goddamn mutt?

01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:16.245
Honey, I got... I gotta go.
Yeah, I gotta go... Bye.

01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:21.583
- Yeah, that's my dog. Yeah.
- Well, he just bit me.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:25.128
- Fred! Come here, Fred.
- I said... He just bit me.

01:07:25.295 --> 01:07:27.840
- Put the son of a bitch out of his misery.
- Let's roast him.

01:07:28.006 --> 01:07:30.801
- That's not a bad idea.
- Eat him.

01:07:30.968 --> 01:07:35.848
I don't think Fred bit you, mister.
Fred absolutely don't like grease.

01:07:41.895 --> 01:07:45.858
Gearjammer, huh?
King of the road, huh?

01:07:51.572 --> 01:07:54.867
- It's time to get out.
- That's a big 10-4.

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:48.670
How much do I owe you, Billy?

01:08:48.837 --> 01:08:52.758
- 73... 84.
- Never mind, just keep the change.

01:08:52.925 --> 01:08:56.678
Sorry what happened, Snowman.

01:08:57.179 --> 01:09:00.182
It's OK, Lamar.

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:28.961
Far out.

01:09:34.216 --> 01:09:36.760
What the hell is this,
a drive-in movie?

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:44.225
Get off of there, you schnauzer's tit!

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:09.543
- How do, Officer. My name's...
- I don't care if it's Broderick Crawford.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:13.839
Don't you know you can't drive
a piece of shit like that on the highway?

01:10:14.006 --> 01:10:17.676
I'll thank you not to use
that kind of language in my presence.

01:10:17.843 --> 01:10:21.722
Never mind that crap.
What the hell is this?

01:10:22.764 --> 01:10:25.684
- This is evidence.
- Evidence?

01:10:25.851 --> 01:10:30.981
I don't care what it is. You can't drive
this piece of shit on my highway.

01:10:31.148 --> 01:10:33.901
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

01:10:34.067 --> 01:10:38.864
I have my young son in the car,
and I don't wanna hear that kinda language.

01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:44.119
- Look! I'm askin' you one single, goddamn...
- Hold it!

01:10:44.495 --> 01:10:46.872
Hold it!

01:10:47.039 --> 01:10:50.959
Don't you ever, ever
raise your voice to me!

01:10:51.126 --> 01:10:53.128
Do you know who you're talkin' to?

01:10:53.295 --> 01:10:56.423
I happen to be Buford T. Justice,

01:10:56.590 --> 01:11:00.427
a distinguished officer
of over 30 years' seniority!

01:11:00.594 --> 01:11:03.972
One of the most highly respected
law-enforcement agents...

01:11:04.139 --> 01:11:07.559
in the United States of America.

01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:12.815
That vehicle happens to be
evidence, valuable evidence,

01:11:12.981 --> 01:11:18.278
that's going to convict a maniac
that I've been tryin' to apprehend

01:11:18.445 --> 01:11:22.491
and that I have been
in high-speed pursuit of

01:11:22.658 --> 01:11:24.743
for 700 miles.

01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:30.833
He is wanted for the Mann Act,
kidnappin'

01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:36.213
and the attempted murder
of over 20 brother officers.

01:11:41.927 --> 01:11:46.807
Sir, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

01:11:47.933 --> 01:11:53.230
It never occurred to me... Well, please, sir,
you proceed immediately, and...

01:11:53.397 --> 01:11:56.150
I hope you'll accept my apologies
for my profanity.

01:11:57.484 --> 01:12:03.365
Apology accepted.
Now...

01:12:11.415 --> 01:12:14.626
How about you, Bandit?
You copy this Snowman? Come on.

01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:16.920
I got ya, son. Come on back.

01:12:17.087 --> 01:12:21.592
You ain't gonna believe this,
but I just did my imitation of Joe Palooka.

01:12:21.758 --> 01:12:24.928
I went a few rounds with some dudes
at this eat-'em-up joint.

01:12:25.095 --> 01:12:29.683
<i>Oh, I believe anything you tell me.
How'd ya do, same as always?</i>

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:33.353
Yeah, about normal. I lost.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.485
We also lost a lot of valuable time.
We gonna really have to cook.

01:12:39.651 --> 01:12:43.947
<i>- Is that a 10-4?
- That's a big 10-4.</i>

01:12:54.291 --> 01:12:58.504
Actually, my heaviest relationship
was with an acid-rock singer...

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:00.339
named Robert Crumly.

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:06.178
We were together... eight and a half days.
God, I really thought that was it.

01:13:06.345 --> 01:13:07.805
And?

01:13:07.971 --> 01:13:11.266
One day I came home
and found him in the shower...

01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:14.353
...with a girl...
and her mother!

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.190
Well, at least
he kept it in the family.

01:13:26.114 --> 01:13:28.992
You have a wonderful way
of putting things.

01:13:29.159 --> 01:13:32.246
- So did he.
- Oh, yes.

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:39.711
<i>Breaker one-nine.
This is the Bandit.</i>

01:13:39.878 --> 01:13:43.173
<i>I'm lookin' for a west-bounder
on highway 85.</i>

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.634
<i>I need a smokey report,
and I need it bad, son.</i>

01:13:45.801 --> 01:13:49.680
This is Foxy Lady, Bandit.
We heard you were comin' by,

01:13:49.847 --> 01:13:52.558
and we decided we'd take care
of those bears for you.

01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:57.813
- You know, a little "personalised service".
- Send me the bill, Foxy Lady.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:01.316
Better yet, why don't you
come by and pay up in person?

01:14:02.276 --> 01:14:06.446
I'll catch you on the flip side, darlin'.
I'm too pooped to pop.

01:14:06.613 --> 01:14:08.323
- Daddy, listen.
- Shut up!

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:10.492
<i>But I'm just ahead of you.</i>

01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:13.495
I'm at mile marker 86.
Come on by, Bandit.

01:14:13.662 --> 01:14:15.664
All right, you talked me into it.

01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:20.210
Now I got that sombitch,
and I got him with his fly open.

01:14:22.296 --> 01:14:26.758
- What do we do when we get home?
- Go to bed. For a week.

01:14:26.925 --> 01:14:29.136
Good idea.

01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:33.557
- And sleep.
- Wanna bet?

01:14:34.766 --> 01:14:37.936
Orville, you seen that new waitress
at the diner, Arlene?

01:14:38.103 --> 01:14:41.899
- She's got some nice legs.
- I'd like to take a run on her.

01:14:42.065 --> 01:14:44.610
- Oh, man, what are you talkin' about?
- I'm tellin' ya.

01:14:44.776 --> 01:14:49.198
Let me tell you somethin' about that.
She makes herself...

01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:54.119
- Feel lucky?
- Let's get him.

01:14:57.664 --> 01:15:00.876
<i>This is car four.
We're in pursuit of the black TransAm.</i>

01:15:01.043 --> 01:15:03.670
<i>It's the Bandit.</i>

01:15:11.804 --> 01:15:15.641
<i># Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'</i>

01:15:15.808 --> 01:15:19.102
<i># We gonna do
what they say can't be done</i>

01:15:19.269 --> 01:15:23.232
<i># We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there</i>

01:15:23.398 --> 01:15:27.027
<i># I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run #</i>

01:15:27.194 --> 01:15:28.946
Oh, shit.

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.787
Breaker one-nine.
Breaker one-nine.

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:40.541
I see a portable gas station
ahead of me. Do you copy?

01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:45.838
Is this Bandit? This is Mr B., gearjammin'
this rollin' refinery. You got a smokey?

01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:50.467
This is the Bandit, son. Can we
slide right into your convoy there?

01:15:50.634 --> 01:15:56.056
Come ahead, Bandit. We'll slip you into
the rockin' chair, play a little hide-and-seek.

01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:59.810
The welcome mat is out,
and you're comin' home.

01:15:59.977 --> 01:16:01.979
10-4.

01:16:03.188 --> 01:16:05.607
- We're going in the rocking chair, honey.
- Good.

01:16:10.737 --> 01:16:15.033
Trucks, I love 'em. I love 'em.

01:16:18.954 --> 01:16:22.708
This is not a convoy.
This is a dream.

01:16:31.675 --> 01:16:34.803
- They can see right down into this car!
- Well, so what?

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:38.682
That's why I used to love to drive
those trucks, darlin'. Spot those beavers.

01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:46.940
- Safe as in your mother's womb, darlin'.
- Is that right?

01:16:47.107 --> 01:16:48.984
<i># Son, never mind them brakes</i>

01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:52.905
<i># Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make</i>

01:16:53.071 --> 01:16:56.742
<i># The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana</i>

01:16:56.909 --> 01:17:01.079
<i># And we'll bring it back
no matter what it takes</i>

01:17:01.246 --> 01:17:05.000
<i># Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'</i>

01:17:05.167 --> 01:17:08.378
<i># We gonna do
what they say can't be done</i>

01:17:08.545 --> 01:17:12.799
<i># We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there</i>

01:17:12.966 --> 01:17:17.054
<i># I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run</i>

01:17:32.736 --> 01:17:36.990
<i># Old Smokey's got them ears on
he's hot on your trail</i>

01:17:37.157 --> 01:17:40.285
<i># He ain't gonna rest
till you're in jail</i>

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:42.287
<i># So you gotta dodge him
you gotta duck him</i>

01:17:42.454 --> 01:17:44.581
<i># You gotta keep
that diesel truckin'</i>

01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:49.711
<i># Just put that hammer down
and give it hell #</i>

01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:54.842
Thank you, Mr B.
I don't know how to thank ya.

01:17:55.008 --> 01:17:57.636
You can thank me
by not gettin' caught.

01:17:57.803 --> 01:18:00.806
Have a good day and a better one
tomorrow, good buddy.

01:18:00.973 --> 01:18:03.809
Hey, Bandit,
this is Little Beaver.

01:18:03.976 --> 01:18:07.771
Put your foot on the floor.
We got your back door, and I'm clear.

01:18:07.938 --> 01:18:12.234
That's a 10-4.
Snowman, you got your ears on, son?

01:18:13.443 --> 01:18:15.571
You've got him, you lucky devil.

01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:17.656
<i>You're about to come up on a convoy.</i>

01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:20.492
Keep your rubber band
stretched real tight.

01:18:20.659 --> 01:18:25.289
10-4, 10-4.
I'm bringin' it, son. I'm clear.

01:18:26.874 --> 01:18:30.460
<i># Eastbound and down
loaded up and truckin'</i>

01:18:30.627 --> 01:18:34.256

01:18:34.423 --> 01:18:38.510
<i># We've got a long way to go

01:18:38.677 --> 01:18:42.347
<i># I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run</i>

01:18:42.514 --> 01:18:46.185
<i># Keep your foot hard on the pedal,
son, never mind them brakes</i>

01:18:46.351 --> 01:18:49.980
<i># Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make</i>

01:18:50.147 --> 01:18:54.193
<i># The boys are thirsty in Atlanta

01:18:54.359 --> 01:18:58.489

01:19:10.334 --> 01:19:13.170
<i># I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run #</i>

01:19:13.337 --> 01:19:18.425
I don't care if you're the Governor of Texas.
You're makin' a big mistake.

01:19:22.596 --> 01:19:25.682
Read him his rights, Junior.

01:19:25.849 --> 01:19:27.643
You have the right to remain silent.

01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:31.855
Anything you say may be held
against you in a court of law. And...

01:19:32.022 --> 01:19:34.441
What's all this about?

01:19:34.691 --> 01:19:38.862
Oh, hello, Officer!
Glad you're here to assist me.

01:19:39.029 --> 01:19:41.698
My name is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.

01:19:41.865 --> 01:19:44.952
I have just apprehended the Bandit.

01:19:45.118 --> 01:19:48.539
No, sir. You just apprehended my captain.

01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:55.003
- Take the cuffs off, Junior.
- But, Daddy, we just...

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:58.841
Take the cuffs off, you moose twit.

01:20:04.138 --> 01:20:10.102
May I express my feelings
about inconveniencing you...

01:20:10.269 --> 01:20:13.522
But if you gonna hang out
in these kinda joints...

01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:16.692
wear a badge on your didie.

01:20:37.087 --> 01:20:39.548
Oh, no.

01:20:39.715 --> 01:20:42.009
Hey, Bandit. Listen to this.

01:20:43.594 --> 01:20:46.513
<i>You know who that is?
That's Mr Evel Knievel.</i>

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.141
He snuck in my back door
when I wasn't lookin'.

01:20:49.308 --> 01:20:52.311
Give me a hand, or we gonna be
in a heap of trouble.

01:20:52.478 --> 01:20:56.773
<i>- Please roger that transmission.
- Hold on to Fred. Here comes the cavalry.</i>

01:21:08.952 --> 01:21:10.913
- Howdy, Officer.
- How ya doin'?

01:21:11.079 --> 01:21:17.044
Give me your licence and manifest, boy.
You know you was goin' 96 miles an hour?

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:19.505
- I was doin' 96...
- You're damn right, you was.

01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:21.798
I didn't know this truck could do 96.

01:21:21.965 --> 01:21:25.761
The judge gets to you, he's gonna
turn you every way but loose.

01:21:25.928 --> 01:21:29.556
It's time you truckers learn
these roads don't belong to you.

01:21:37.648 --> 01:21:40.984
You be careful, you hear?

01:22:00.712 --> 01:22:05.342
<i>- Whoa. Want a little piece of advice, Bandit?
- Yeah. Lay it on me, son.</i>

01:22:05.509 --> 01:22:10.764
Don't take your foot off of that hammer.
Them bears'll pour over you like maple syrup.

01:22:46.842 --> 01:22:48.635
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:22:48.802 --> 01:22:53.265
- Don't you know this ain't Saturday?
- Thanks a lot.

01:23:27.591 --> 01:23:30.803
We don't need assistance.
I've got him in my sights.

01:23:37.392 --> 01:23:40.813
Headquarters, disregard
my last transmission.

01:24:10.134 --> 01:24:14.471
Son... you reckon you can
let me off at the next exit?

01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:17.641
- Go get your daddy a beer.
- OK.

01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:20.227
<i>...I understand every cop
in the state's after him.</i>

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:24.273
- Stay 10-10. I'll let you know.
- That's a big 10-4.

01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:27.192
Damn, he's been stirring up some trouble.

01:24:36.118 --> 01:24:38.829
Ooh, it's the Bandit!

01:24:54.803 --> 01:24:59.766
<i>I'm Hot To Trot. Just tell me how
I can help and I'm with ya, body and soul.</i>

01:24:59.933 --> 01:25:03.228
<i>- Channel clear.
- Breaker one-nine, breaker one-nine.</i>

01:25:03.395 --> 01:25:05.647
Is that Hot Pants Hilliard
yakkin' out there?

01:25:05.814 --> 01:25:08.817
<i>- And who wants to know?
- This is the Bandit, darling.</i>

01:25:08.984 --> 01:25:12.654
Well, where are you,
you bodied-up, smooth-talkin' thing?

01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:15.032
And how can I help?
Bring it back.

01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:18.118
You still workin' at that
choke-and-puke on West 85?

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:21.830
Affirmative, affirmative.
I'm still dishin' it out.

01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:27.044
We'll come screamin' by in five minutes
with a herd of smokeys on our ass.

01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:30.297
<i>How 'bout gettin' those pallies
of yours out there, block 'em off?</i>

01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:33.467
Love to! But hey,
you're gonna owe me one.

01:25:33.634 --> 01:25:37.346
- I owe you a big one.
- That's a big 10-4.

01:25:37.513 --> 01:25:39.181
10-4.

01:25:41.016 --> 01:25:45.229
All right, gang, we're gonna go
for a big smokey red 22. Wahoo!

01:25:45.395 --> 01:25:47.189
- Ride with me?
- Yeah.

01:25:52.986 --> 01:25:58.158
- You sure we ain't gonna get in trouble?
- Nah. I've done it before.

01:26:12.881 --> 01:26:16.844
- We're comin' at you, darlin'. Are you ready?
- Ready, willin' and able.

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:21.098
"Ready and willing. " Ha.
She always was.

01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:27.938
<i>OK, gang, be alert,
'cause here he comes.</i>

01:26:28.105 --> 01:26:32.693
<i>- Well, go ahead and answer.
- 10-4, Hot Pants. We copy.</i>

01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:34.820
Let go of the button.

01:27:17.321 --> 01:27:21.533
Paydirt. I just picked up
the Bandit eastbound on 95.

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.285
All units converge.

01:27:23.452 --> 01:27:26.914
<i>I copy, Chopper One.
I'm on my way.</i>

01:27:39.968 --> 01:27:41.178
<i>Heading for the fairgrounds!</i>

01:28:05.244 --> 01:28:09.248
<i>This is car 12, Bobby Lee,
and I have him westbound on 75.</i>

01:28:21.343 --> 01:28:26.473
<i>- Cledus, where the hell are we?
- Four miles to go, good buddy.</i>

01:28:27.975 --> 01:28:31.895
- Four miles. Goddamn it!
- Four miles...

01:28:38.026 --> 01:28:41.572
Bo, did you count on this?

01:28:41.738 --> 01:28:44.449
I mean, all of this?

01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:52.374
No, I didn't, honey.

01:28:56.545 --> 01:28:59.965
<i>- Cledus?
- Talk to me, my boy.</i>

01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:03.677
Goddamn it, son,
we gave it our best shot.

01:29:03.844 --> 01:29:07.890
I don't like this any more
than you do, but...

01:29:08.056 --> 01:29:11.185
We ain't gonna make it, son.
We're gonna hang it up.

01:29:11.351 --> 01:29:13.937
Whoa, negatory, negatory!
You crazy or somethin'?

01:29:14.104 --> 01:29:18.650
We come this far, ain't we? When we say
we gonna do a job, we do a job!

01:29:18.817 --> 01:29:21.820
It's me they're after. They don't
even know Cledus Snow exists.

01:29:21.987 --> 01:29:26.950
Oh, they don't?
Well, I'll tell you what we gonna do.

01:29:27.784 --> 01:29:31.121
We gonna introduce 'em to the boy.
So move over, good buddy,

01:29:31.288 --> 01:29:36.210
'cause the Snowman is comin' through.
Hold on to your ass, Fred.

01:29:45.761 --> 01:29:47.721
Hot damn, we're gonna make it.

01:30:06.365 --> 01:30:09.201
Move them vehicles.
We gotta get through!

01:30:09.368 --> 01:30:11.787
Here they come!

01:30:49.116 --> 01:30:52.828
Daddy, you're about to have
your evenin' ruined for you.

01:31:07.634 --> 01:31:09.678
- OK.
- All right.

01:31:09.845 --> 01:31:12.681
- We're in trouble.
- I know we're in trouble.

01:31:12.848 --> 01:31:14.850
- What time is it?
- One minute after.

01:31:15.017 --> 01:31:17.936
- Goddamn, we're 10 minutes early.
- We're in trouble!

01:31:18.103 --> 01:31:20.731
We need a way out of here.
We need the money.

01:31:20.898 --> 01:31:24.276
Here's my Cadillac. That'll leave me
with an even dozen. Good luck, son.

01:31:24.443 --> 01:31:26.320
- Cledus, get the money.
- How 'bout the money?

01:31:26.487 --> 01:31:28.864
- How 'bout double or nothin'?
- How 'bout forgettin' it?

01:31:29.031 --> 01:31:30.574
What about double or nothin'?

01:31:30.741 --> 01:31:34.119
You run up to Boston,
bring back some clam chowder.

01:31:35.454 --> 01:31:37.206
- You're on.
- Uh, you're on.

01:31:37.372 --> 01:31:41.168
- In 18 hours?
- You're still on.

01:31:41.335 --> 01:31:45.088
Y- y-you're crazy!
And I'm divorced!

01:31:45.255 --> 01:31:48.759
And you... Ain't half bad, is it?

01:32:06.568 --> 01:32:10.697
20 to one
I break the son of a bitch this time.

01:32:16.036 --> 01:32:18.121
Gimme 500 on the Bandit.

01:32:25.045 --> 01:32:28.382
Apprehend that horse ass
for reckless drivin'!

01:32:28.549 --> 01:32:33.470
- But, Daddy, he's...
- Do what I tell you, you pile of monkey nuts!

01:32:39.268 --> 01:32:43.730
<i>Sheriff Buford T. Justice, please.</i>

01:32:43.897 --> 01:32:46.775
- Who there?
- This is Bandit Darville talkin'.

01:32:47.526 --> 01:32:49.736
Where are you, you sombitch?

01:32:49.945 --> 01:32:53.949
Before I tell you where I am, Sheriff,
there's just one thing I wanna say.

01:32:54.116 --> 01:32:58.370
You must be part coon dog,
'cause I been chased by the best of 'em,

01:32:58.537 --> 01:33:02.291
and son, you make 'em look
like they're all runnin' in slow motion.

01:33:02.457 --> 01:33:06.879
- I just wanna say that.
- Well, thank you, Mr Bandit.

01:33:07.045 --> 01:33:13.594
And as the pursuer, may I say you're
the goddamnedest pursuee I ever pursued.

01:33:15.012 --> 01:33:17.681
<i>Now that the mutual bullshit is over,</i>

01:33:17.848 --> 01:33:20.058
where are you, you sombitch?

01:33:20.225 --> 01:33:25.105
I'm right down at the bottom of the hill.
I'm six-foot-eight, in a cowboy outfit.

01:33:25.272 --> 01:33:28.859
I got a little pygmy standing beside me
dressed like me. You can't miss me.

01:33:29.026 --> 01:33:31.111
<i>10-4.</i>

01:33:33.864 --> 01:33:36.408
Wait a minute.
Scratch that. Hold it.

01:33:36.575 --> 01:33:41.163
I can't lie to you, Sheriff. You're too good
a man. Look over your left shoulder.

01:33:45.501 --> 01:33:47.127
Oof.

01:33:47.294 --> 01:33:51.965
We're on our way to Boston
to get some clam chowder. Bye-bye.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.553
- No hard feelings, Junior!
- I'm not givin' up!

01:34:01.558 --> 01:34:03.977
I'm never gonna give up!
I'll get you, you sombitch!

01:34:04.144 --> 01:34:08.649
Daddy, wait for me! Don't leave me!
Who's gonna hold your hat?
