23:56.826 --> 24:00.482
Yeah, well, you in general
have been a very nice surprise.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.875
[chuckles]

24:03.920 --> 24:05.226
Thank you.

24:05.269 --> 24:07.271
[phone chimes]

24:09.622 --> 24:11.406
Hold on one sec.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.103
Uh, rude.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.671
Sorry. It's just Pam. We've got
this celebratory brunch thing,

24:15.715 --> 24:19.196
and if I don't text back
immediately, she'll call.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.459
She's one of those.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.851
[snickers]What are you celebrating?

24:21.895 --> 24:23.418
Uh, just a work thing.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.465
A work thing? Be more vague.

24:26.508 --> 24:30.338
Sorry. It's just that
woman we're after.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.645
She's expecting a big shipment
that we'll intercept,

24:32.688 --> 24:36.083
and then she'll be
done, because of me.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.824
[both chuckle]

24:37.867 --> 24:40.914
Sorry, that sounded really
pompous, but I just,

24:40.957 --> 24:43.525
I worked really hard.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.006
Congratulations.Thanks.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.442
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I didn't tell you.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.878
That cop you dated.Mm-hmm.

24:48.922 --> 24:51.011
He was aggressively kicked out
of a big meeting.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.708
Are you serious?Yeah.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.449
Yeah, his boss threw him,

24:54.493 --> 24:57.060
threw him off the case
in front of everyone.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.323
It was quite something.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.108
Aw, I'm so sad for him.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.762
[laughs softly]

25:04.024 --> 25:05.416
So, I don't,I don't, like, really know

25:05.460 --> 25:07.549
a lot about this stuff, um,

25:07.593 --> 25:10.030
'cause I've only ever bought,like, an eighth of weed.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.336
I'm just saying, like, that's
all I have to compare it to.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.990
So I don't know. What is,like, a drug lord buying?

25:14.034 --> 25:16.340
Enough that they have to
store it at a warehouse.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.255
It's, like, millions of dollars'worth of heroin.

25:18.299 --> 25:20.388
Bigger than an eighth of weed,
I'll tell you that much.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.650
Oh, wow.

25:21.694 --> 25:24.218
See? I told you
I catch bad guys.

25:24.261 --> 25:25.480
Yeah.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.313
That's crazy.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.754
Y'all can go.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.759
This is becomingsomewhat of a tradition.

25:43.803 --> 25:45.848
[door opens]I know.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.763
So what information
you got for me now?

25:47.807 --> 25:49.678
[door closes]The Feds know about
your shipment.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.767
They're planning on interceptingit at the warehouse.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.682
How could you possibly know
about that?

25:53.726 --> 25:56.293
I'm having sex with this guy
from the IRS.

25:56.337 --> 25:57.817
So you can

25:57.860 --> 26:00.036
redirect the shipment
to Guiding Hope

26:00.080 --> 26:02.604
and then disperse it to your
other stash houses from there.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.824
Well, it ain't gonna fit
in that safe.

26:04.867 --> 26:05.955
We have a basement.

26:07.217 --> 26:08.567
And what do you want?

26:08.610 --> 26:10.525
Nothing.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.179
Hmm.[laughs softly]

26:12.222 --> 26:13.833
You asked me for
some of my loyalty.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.531
That's what I'm giving you.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.794
And I appreciate that.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.671
You hungry?

26:25.714 --> 26:27.194
The room service here
is pretty good.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.978
I could order us up
a couple of steaks,

26:29.022 --> 26:30.284
maybe get a nice bottle of wine.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.416
What do you say?Sure.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.157
How you like your steak?

26:36.203 --> 26:38.205
Well done.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.302
[groaning]

26:48.345 --> 26:50.173
What was the other option,
Felix? Go to jail?

26:50.217 --> 26:51.566
Yes. Yes!Okay.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.699
I would happilytake jail, actually,

26:53.742 --> 26:59.095
over a warehouse worthof heroin in our basement.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.183
Plus, are you forgetting
the fact

27:00.227 --> 27:01.445
that Dean almost caught you?

27:01.489 --> 27:03.665
He got kicked
off the case.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.798
And if they were on to us even
a little, Josh would know.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.538
Oh, my God.

27:07.582 --> 27:10.454
Look, I had to, for Jess.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.674
Oh, just stop, Murphy.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.241
You didn't have to for Jess.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.678
What is that supposed to mean?You did this

27:16.722 --> 27:18.288
because you like it.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.029
Ever since we startedthis whole thing,

27:20.073 --> 27:21.770
all you've wanted
is to get us out,

27:21.814 --> 27:23.685
but look how far
you've dug us in.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.255
That's mine.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.822
You're right.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.563
Maybe I do like it.

27:32.607 --> 27:35.697
Because I'm good at it.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.090
And I'm not good

27:37.133 --> 27:40.093
at a lot of things, so...

27:40.136 --> 27:42.661
That's how I know I can get us
out, and I am getting us out.

27:42.704 --> 27:43.879
But you don't have to be here.

27:43.923 --> 27:46.273
And you can ditch me
just like Jess did.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.711
I'm not gonna do that.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.713
Why not?

27:53.193 --> 27:55.674
Because I'm pretty good
at this, too.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.286

No.

28:05.814 --> 28:08.382

28:08.425 --> 28:09.644

28:09.688 --> 28:11.385
I know. I had a, uh...

28:11.428 --> 28:14.040
school thing for Chloe.
What's going on?

28:14.083 --> 28:16.738
You didn't hear?Hear what?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.261
No one showed upthis morning.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.176
Not Nia, not the Ocana guys.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.482
No one. They had 40 of our guys

28:21.525 --> 28:23.005
standing aroundlooking like idiots.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.747
Yeah, well, I knew Nia was nevergonna let that go down.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.923
Yeah, well, I can see why
no one's been able to pin her.

28:27.967 --> 28:28.968
Yeah, well, I have to.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.274
Okay?

28:34.103 --> 28:37.150
I am telling you, the way to getto her is through Murphy Mason.

28:37.193 --> 28:39.500
Dean, we don't have
anything on her, man.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.027

But you're sitting here now,aren't you?

35:47.884 --> 35:49.059
That's because your charges
were dropped

35:49.103 --> 35:51.192
by your arresting officer: me.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.368
Look, I got Murphydead to rights.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.979
I turn in that cane,
she is looking at ten years?

35:56.023 --> 35:57.590
Probably more.

35:57.633 --> 36:01.159
And I don't want that for her,and I know you don't, either.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.204
If she flips on Nia,

36:03.248 --> 36:05.293
I can guarantee
she doesn't do any time.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.599
And Nia will never know
it was her.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.731
So get her to flip.

36:08.775 --> 36:11.473
She's not gonna work with me,
which is why I need you.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.651
Ah. So that's why
you got me out.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.394
Look, I know I'm probably
the last person

36:19.438 --> 36:22.528
that you feel inclined to trust.

36:22.571 --> 36:24.965
I can get it in writing
if I have to.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.749
All I need
is for Murphy to admit

36:26.793 --> 36:29.317
that she is trafficking drugs
for Nia. That's it.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.887
So what is this?

36:33.930 --> 36:36.759
Is this some kind of ultimatum?

36:36.803 --> 36:40.633
Like, if I don't do what
you want, I go back to prison?

36:40.676 --> 36:43.592
No.

36:43.636 --> 36:46.204
You're out.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.771
But it's up to you
what you do about Murphy.

36:48.815 --> 36:52.514
You can save her or she can do
time that Nia should be doing.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.995
Like I said...
[exhales]

36:55.038 --> 36:56.997
I'm just trying
to right some wrongs.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.826
Come on. Eat
something.

37:04.831 --> 37:08.269
Where's the rest of it?

37:08.313 --> 37:10.576
She gave us all of it,

37:10.619 --> 37:12.665
but you won't be ableto steal it without our help.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.101
So what's in it for you?

37:14.144 --> 37:15.494
When Nia finds outall of her drugs are gone,

37:15.537 --> 37:17.409
you knowshe'll kill us.

37:17.452 --> 37:21.587
So I need a guarantee from youthat you won't let that happen.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.198
Done.How can I be sure?

37:24.242 --> 37:26.069
Prove it.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.291
Nia's only power
is in her product.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.554
I happen to know she got
this shipment on credit.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.469
She doesn't have that much cash.

37:34.513 --> 37:37.690
If it comes up missing,
she'll have to flee

37:37.733 --> 37:39.822
before the cartel
kills her.

37:39.866 --> 37:41.433
Nia has a lot of people
who are loyal to her.

37:41.476 --> 37:44.305
These guys...

37:44.349 --> 37:46.481
they're only loyal to me becauseI put a roof over their head.

37:46.525 --> 37:48.222
Nia's people are the same.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.442
And soon they'll work
for me. Until then,

37:50.485 --> 37:51.704
you can stay
at a safe house.

37:51.747 --> 37:55.055
Fully guarded, fully secure,
by my people.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.536
You'll be good there until I canconfirm that she's either dead

37:57.579 --> 37:58.885
or out of
the country.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.930
You'll never have
to see her again.

38:00.974 --> 38:05.674
And once Nia's dealt with,
we don't work for you.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.285
I never said you did.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.417
So we have a deal?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.593
Yes. I'll assemble a crew.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.683
We have a few days before
Nia disperses the product.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.729
But just out
of curiosity,

38:16.772 --> 38:19.514
how did you get Nia
to trust you so much?

38:19.558 --> 38:21.429
She likes me.

38:21.473 --> 38:22.430
[chuckles]

38:22.474 --> 38:23.779
What?

38:27.653 --> 38:31.700
She always told me
that relationships

38:31.744 --> 38:34.007
are the death of this business.

38:34.050 --> 38:39.229
It's just... ironic.

38:39.273 --> 38:42.494
JOSH:
I just can't stop thinking
about what went wrong.

38:42.537 --> 38:45.671
I mean, we had her.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.716
She was right there.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.719
I just don't know how
she got tipped off.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.547
I'm sorry, I'll
snap out of it.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.335
Let me help.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.625
[sighs]

39:39.812 --> 39:41.814
[sighs]

40:00.789 --> 40:03.009
[clears throat]

40:03.052 --> 40:06.491
You're not staying?Uh, I left

40:06.534 --> 40:08.144
my stupid birth control at home.

40:08.188 --> 40:09.624
Can't you get it in the morning?

40:09.668 --> 40:12.235
Sure. And then
nine months later,

40:12.279 --> 40:13.498
we can raise a baby together.

40:13.541 --> 40:14.760
[chuckles]That's a cool idea.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.718
Well, hang on.
I'll come with you.

40:16.762 --> 40:19.417
No, no, no, no. I'll be
back in, like, 20 minutes.

40:19.460 --> 40:22.550
Just stay warm.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.552
Stay naked.

40:24.596 --> 40:26.249
Stay British.[laughs]

40:26.293 --> 40:27.816
Wait, is this justan elaborate excuse

40:27.860 --> 40:29.818
so you don't have
to stay the night?

40:29.862 --> 40:31.341
No.

40:31.385 --> 40:32.604
Good.

40:35.041 --> 40:38.697
There is something
that you should know.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.176
What?

40:43.789 --> 40:45.704
I k-kind of like you.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.749
[laughs softly]
Yeah.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.142
I kind oflike you, too.

40:49.185 --> 40:50.796
My little crumpet.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.624
Excuse me?You heard me.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.582
You crumpet.

40:54.626 --> 40:57.498
I don't even want to know
what that is. Pretzel?

40:57.542 --> 40:58.804
[elevator bell chimes]

41:03.678 --> 41:05.680
Hey! Pretzel.

41:09.858 --> 41:12.600
Murph, it's me.

41:14.167 --> 41:16.169
Max?

41:20.390 --> 41:23.089
MURPHY:
I mean, you're out?

41:23.132 --> 41:24.569
Here we go.

41:24.612 --> 41:25.961
How did this happen?

41:29.399 --> 41:32.098
[phone buzzing]

41:32.141 --> 41:33.491
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Call from Josh.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.275
Oh, my God.It's fine.

41:35.318 --> 41:36.972
It's fine?
Then why is he calling you

41:37.016 --> 41:38.887
in the middle of the night?
Does he know where you are?

41:38.931 --> 41:41.411
No. But, I mean, I was supposed
to go back over there.

41:41.455 --> 41:42.761
Then all of this happened.

41:42.804 --> 41:44.806
Missed call from Josh.
