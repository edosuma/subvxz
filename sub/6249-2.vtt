BOOTH:
Look,Bones,all I'm saying
is that Caroline went to a lot

01:17.160 --> 01:19.960
of trouble to get you private
visitation with your father,

01:20.030 --> 01:21.430
and now you
don't want it.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.660
The federal detention facility
already has visiting areas.

01:23.730 --> 01:25.660
Yeah,behind
two-inch glass.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.200
I mean,now you'll be able
to give your old man,
you know,a hug!

01:28.260 --> 01:30.600
I didn't ask for
special treatment,Booth.

01:30.660 --> 01:33.800
That's because
you don't have to,
because you <i>are</i> special!

01:33.860 --> 01:35.000
And you are
gonna tell me...

01:35.060 --> 01:36.500
Whoa,what happened

01:36.560 --> 01:39.600
to whatever the hell is melted
to that steering wheel

01:39.660 --> 01:41.130
and... everything else?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.000
It's female,

01:43.060 --> 01:45.530
mid-40s to late 50s.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.700
Pelvis indicates
she's given birth.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.900
Hey,Bones,look at
that-- married,right?

01:50.960 --> 01:53.800
Wedding ring--
it's a possibility.

01:53.860 --> 01:56.130
Don't just focus
on the ground.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.400
(siren wails nearby)

01:57.460 --> 01:59.600
Why do you care

01:59.660 --> 02:01.530
about my relationship
with my father,Booth?

02:01.600 --> 02:03.700
You were only too
happy to arrest him

02:03.760 --> 02:04.960
and put him in prison.

02:05.030 --> 02:06.430
All right,look,
Bones,you know,

02:06.500 --> 02:08.060
it's not about
being happy,okay?

02:08.130 --> 02:09.759
It's about doing my job.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.300
Do we know if it was a bomb
that caused the explosion?

02:12.360 --> 02:14.130
Well,let's see,
the roof is peeled back,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.300
and the doors and...
I was asking him.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.130
We found explosive residue

02:18.200 --> 02:20.800
all over the van and metal
fragments in the bushes.

02:20.860 --> 02:23.430
What is that,
a pipe bomb?
I can't really be sure

02:23.500 --> 02:25.860
until the explosive unit
gets the van back to the lab.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.430
No,they can't have the van.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.600
There are remains seared
all over the inside

02:29.660 --> 02:31.800
of the vehicle,
and they can't be compromised.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.160
I have to call and get...

02:33.230 --> 02:35.030
This van will be brought
to the Jeffersonian.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.100
Your bomb techs
can look at it there.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.300
I'll... make the call?

02:38.360 --> 02:40.300
That's all right,
you go make that call.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.500
Bones,come on,you were
a little harsh there.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.700
Maybe you want
to talk it out.
Look,Booth.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.400
BOOTH:
It's a locket.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.530
Aw,it's...

02:48.600 --> 02:49.860
probably her daughter.

02:49.930 --> 02:53.560
Who would want
to blow up a soccer mom?

03:31.160 --> 03:33.560
Hey,you have a skull
for a facial reconstruction?

03:33.630 --> 03:34.900
Help yourself.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.300
Oh,great.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.600
Is this all I have to work with?

03:38.660 --> 03:40.230
I've always hated puzzles.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.730
Hodgins,before we take
the hands from the wheel,

03:42.800 --> 03:44.630
you might want
to check the fingernails

03:44.700 --> 03:47.500
for particulates.
You know I do.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.260
Oh,my God.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.600
Shouldn't you wait
for the bomb tech

03:50.660 --> 03:52.600
before you gather
the explosive residue?

03:52.660 --> 03:55.330
I'm just getting enough
to verify his results.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.760
Remember,he's
a government bureaucrat.

03:56.830 --> 03:59.330
Hey,<i>you're</i>
a government bureaucrat,babe.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.930
I am a passionate,

04:02.000 --> 04:03.730
dedicated scientist
who will not be cowed

04:03.800 --> 04:05.260
by authoritarian pressure.

04:05.330 --> 04:08.030
Stay out of the van until
the bomb tech comes,Hodgins.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.430
But...
Out.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.200
(sighs)
Fine. I have to check
the fingernails anyway.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.660
How close are we to
ID'ing the victim?

04:15.730 --> 04:17.230
Well,this is

04:17.300 --> 04:18.500
the skull.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.360
I'm good,but...
I'm not that good.

04:20.430 --> 04:22.200
BRENNAN:
Perhaps you could use these.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.700
There's a portion of tongue,

04:23.760 --> 04:25.230
hair and...

04:25.300 --> 04:26.530
brain matter.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.930
Okay. If anybody
needs me,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.430
I'm gonna go throw up,
then do some paperwork.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.100
Okay,this is
Special Agent Frost

04:34.160 --> 04:35.330
from the bomb unit.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.530
Booth pulled me out
of an important lunch.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.830
It took me months

04:38.900 --> 04:41.730
to set up that meeting.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.700
It better be good,Booth.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.030
She'll be working
with you,Hodgins.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.130
Yes,please.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.830
What? No. Um,hm?

04:49.900 --> 04:50.830
Hodgins.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.330
Doc-Doctor.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.030
We're... okay?
(Frost laughs)

04:54.100 --> 04:55.230
I beg your pardon?

04:55.300 --> 04:57.360
It's...
He's Dr. Jack Hodgins.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.860
Angela...

04:58.930 --> 05:00.000
Montenegro.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.960
I do facial reconstructions.

05:02.030 --> 05:03.830
And him.
Mm.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.060
Pleasure to meet you.

05:06.900 --> 05:10.500
I'm gonna need you
to recover all the
metallic particulates,

05:10.560 --> 05:12.100
then I'm gonna need
a chemical tray

05:12.160 --> 05:13.900
with aqueous
buffer solution.
Aqueous buffer solution.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.500
Yeah,I-I know.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.260
You want to perform
capillary electrophoresis?

05:20.330 --> 05:22.360
You can do that?
Oh,yeah.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.960
And it will save time,

05:27.030 --> 05:29.100
so Angela

05:29.160 --> 05:32.560
Mm.
and I can have
dinner alone.

05:32.630 --> 05:35.030
BOOTH:
 <i>The license plate</i>
 <i>was destroyed,</i>

05:35.100 --> 05:36.330
<i>but we traced the VIN number</i>

05:36.400 --> 05:38.860
on the van-- it was,uh,
registered to Jeremy Nash

05:38.930 --> 05:40.060
in Culpepper,Virginia.

05:40.130 --> 05:45.000
BRENNAN:
He looks familiar.

05:45.060 --> 05:47.160
with a lot of stuff:
clothes,personal items.

05:47.230 --> 05:49.030
BRENNAN:
Photo album.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.730
Most of the pictures
were burned,

05:50.800 --> 05:52.460
but the man in this photo

05:52.530 --> 05:54.360
could be Nash.

05:54.430 --> 05:56.830
She packed herself up,
keepsakes and all,

05:56.900 --> 05:58.660
and took off in a van?

05:58.730 --> 06:01.700
Looks like Mrs. Nash
was leaving Mr. Nash.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.460
Oh,God,I hate domestic cases.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.200
All right,so let's
go talk to the husband.

06:05.260 --> 06:06.930
I can't.
I'm seeing my father.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.630
Now?
You and Caroline

06:08.700 --> 06:10.630
went to a lot of trouble
setting this up.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.300
d hate
to appear ungrateful.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.760
But...

06:14.830 --> 06:17.560
I'll go talk to,um...

06:17.630 --> 06:20.530
the husband by myself.

06:23.630 --> 06:25.330
(door opening)
GUARD:
All right,Max,there you go.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.130
Ooh,gee.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.360
Real chairs.

06:30.430 --> 06:32.430
It's nice to have
an important daughter.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.030
This is Booth,
not me.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.600
Well,you thank him
for me.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.300
I always liked Booth.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.700
Nicest guy that
ever arrested me.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.200
Touching.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.200
Well,you must like this--
me in here.

06:46.260 --> 06:48.360
I finally have
to follow the rules.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.260
hat makes me

06:50.330 --> 06:54.430
less than you,because I think
people should follow the rules?

06:54.500 --> 06:55.460
You're upset.

06:55.530 --> 06:56.630
Yeah,of course I'm upset.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.830
My father's a criminal.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.460
No,outlaw.
There's a difference.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.260
Subtle distinctions like that
are lost on me,

07:02.330 --> 07:04.260
and,I imagine,your victims.

07:04.330 --> 07:06.100
I know you want
some sort of a...

07:06.160 --> 07:09.200
nice,neat story
that puts my life

07:09.260 --> 07:12.630
into perspective for you,
but it doesn't work that way.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.630
You could try.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.400
Don't I deserve that?

07:16.460 --> 07:20.100
I guess I always had
a problem with authority.

07:20.160 --> 07:26.230
I just always saw myself
fighting the system,

07:26.300 --> 07:28.960
kind Do you realize
how ridiculous you sound?

07:29.030 --> 07:31.130
You're here
for murdering

07:31.200 --> 07:33.200
the deputy director of the FBI.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.800
He was a crook,he was a killer
and he was going to kill you.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.860
And you walked out
on Russ and me

07:37.930 --> 07:39.200
when I was 15.

07:39.260 --> 07:40.760
But that was to protect you--
people were after us.

07:40.830 --> 07:43.560
Because you were a criminal.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.800
Outlaw.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.430
See? I knew you weren't
going to understand.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.760
You know what? You're right.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.900
This is my fault for expecting
we could get past...

07:49.960 --> 07:51.860
We can get
past this.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.130
We can.

07:53.130 --> 07:54.530
Th

07:54.600 --> 07:56.800
how to punish me.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.060
But now? Here?

07:58.130 --> 08:00.800
Come on,we can make this
whatever we want.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.700
Here are the cards
you asked for.

08:09.760 --> 08:10.830
I gotta to go.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.260
Wait. These are for us.
What?

08:14.360 --> 08:16.130
Come on,you remember
that game we used to play

08:16.200 --> 08:19.100
when you were five years old?

08:19.160 --> 08:20.300
Blitz. Blitz..

08:20.360 --> 08:22.130
Come on,let's play
a couple of hands.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.330
You always beat me.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.660
I remember that,too.

08:24.730 --> 08:27.530
A good father would occasionally
allow his child to win.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.060
I don't believe
in encouraging

08:29.130 --> 08:31.300
all that,uh,
that self-esteem crap.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.600
You want to win,earn it.

08:33.659 --> 08:35.600
That's why you're so good
at what you do now,

08:35.659 --> 08:38.460
because you know that nobody
is going to hand you anything.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.730
So you were a great father?

08:40.799 --> 08:43.130
Well,maybe just not
as bad as you think.

08:44.730 --> 08:46.500
How 'bout this,one hand?
Come on.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.400
Let me know if you
need anything else.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.800
Well... socks.

08:51.860 --> 08:54.300
Socks,you know? The,uh...
with arch supports.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.500
I got to stand in that
chow line forever.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.100
NASH:
A bomb?

09:06.160 --> 09:07.760
BOOTH:
Yeah,I'm sorry.
Where you and your wife

09:07.830 --> 09:09.260
having any problems?

09:09.330 --> 09:10.900
What-What kind of problems?

09:10.960 --> 09:13.260
Well,she was traveling with
a lot of personal stuff.

09:13.330 --> 09:15.660
Photo albums,
and more clothes...

09:15.730 --> 09:17.530
That stuff was for
Celia's new dorm room.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.630
She was bringing her clothes,
things to help decorate...

09:19.700 --> 09:22.600
You're FBI,for God sakes!

09:22.660 --> 09:24.560
You have no idea
who did this?

09:24.630 --> 09:26.760
What is this,your first case?
Just relax.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.130
Okay?

09:28.200 --> 09:30.530
I'm just here to help,
Mr. Nash,that's all.

09:30.600 --> 09:35.860
How do I tell Celia?

09:35.930 --> 09:40.030
How do I... tell my daughter?

09:42.930 --> 09:45.430
ADDY:
Dermestes maculatus.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.060
They clean the bones
by eating the charred flesh.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.360
But they leave behind pieces
of shrapnel you might need.

09:50.430 --> 09:52.630
Fascinating
and very weird.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.230
They're mine.

09:54.330 --> 09:56.260
Not a surprise.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.100
HODGINS:
Hey. Hi.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.230
How was your visit with your...

09:59.300 --> 10:00.430
Not germane
to the investigation,Hodgins...

10:00.500 --> 10:04.400
Zack,her left shoulder
was badly shattered,

10:04.460 --> 10:06.700
but still shows
evidence of old trauma.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.260
I need the cleaned bones
as soon as they're ready.

10:09.330 --> 10:11.760
I also would like you
to look at the manubrium.

10:11.830 --> 10:13.230
These shadows
look like pitting.
(sighs)

10:13.300 --> 10:15.860
Have you determined
what kind of bomb was used?

10:15.930 --> 10:17.700
I'm still sifting through debris

10:17.760 --> 10:20.400
and waiting for whatever goodies
these bugs leave behind.

10:20.460 --> 10:22.930
And Dr. Hodgins
is just...

10:23.000 --> 10:24.160
keeping you company?

10:24.230 --> 10:25.560
What? No.

10:25.630 --> 10:27.760
(chuckling):
I'm working.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.400
Hard.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.760
I'm going to go
right now and work...

10:35.030 --> 10:38.630
...hard some-someplace
else,so...

10:55.330 --> 10:57.800
Hey.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.360
What are you doing down here?

10:59.430 --> 11:02.300
Uh,analyzing the iconography
for the Widow's Son case

11:02.360 --> 11:04.860
until somebody needs me
for the bomb victim.

11:04.930 --> 11:08.930
(clears throat)
Look,Angie,um,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.260
Agent Frost
is-is a colleague,

11:11.330 --> 11:12.960
and I am a professional.

11:13.030 --> 11:14.530
Okay,so,

11:14.600 --> 11:17.000
all the stammering and stuff,
I mean,that's not...

11:17.060 --> 11:18.260
That isn't... I... It's...

11:18.330 --> 11:20.260
You know,that's...
it's involuntary.

11:20.330 --> 11:23.030
It's a... It's a bodily thing.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.630
Yeah,that didn't
come out right.

11:26.130 --> 11:28.760
Look,I'm not going to deny
that she is attractive.

11:28.830 --> 11:29.830
Oh,totally hot.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.330
What?

11:31.400 --> 11:34.000
The bombshell
from the bomb squad.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.030
She's totally hot.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.500
Yeah,I know-- I mean...

11:37.560 --> 11:39.200
Look,Jack,

11:39.260 --> 11:42.530
I really don't care
what's going on in your pants.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.660
As long as it staysr pants.

11:46.730 --> 11:48.260
You know who's totally hot?

11:48.330 --> 11:50.530
You.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.800
You are
totally...

11:51.860 --> 11:53.060
Okay,save it.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.730
What have you got?

11:54.800 --> 11:58.100
These were in
Amy Nash's bag.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.660
Hmm. There's writing on them.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.860
Yeah. Yeah,Cam needs you
to restore them.

12:01.930 --> 12:07.760
I'll give it a try.

12:07.830 --> 12:10.100
FROST (over P.A.):
Dr. Hodgins,I need your samples
for tI-I-I... I have to...

12:10.160 --> 12:11.430
Uh...

12:11.500 --> 12:13.500
So,I... love you,and...

12:14.530 --> 12:16.330
Go.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
Okay.

12:18.460 --> 12:21.030
BOOTH:
 <i>Nash is going</i>
 <i>to pick up his kid,</i>

12:21.100 --> 12:22.200
tell her in person.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.260
I mean,I don't know
how you do that.

12:24.330 --> 12:26.560
Tell your kid that your
mother just got blown up?

12:26.630 --> 12:28.630
I would think
a direct approach would be best.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.200
What,as opposed to
what,sugarcoating it?

12:30.260 --> 12:31.830
"Hey,what do you say
we go to the park?

12:31.900 --> 12:34.200
Oh,and by the way,your
mom just got blown up"?

12:34.260 --> 12:36.130
How's your dad? You
haven't mentioned him.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.360
Apparently,
his feet hurt.

12:38.430 --> 12:40.030
You know,I mean
his spirits.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.830
Well,he's a con man,
Booth.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.160
He's always cheerful.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.360
What? That's it?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.960
Well,it's not like
I ever really had a father.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.260
Max was absent
for years.

12:48.330 --> 12:49.730
Well,here's what I know.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.730
I know that Nash girl
would give anything

12:51.800 --> 12:53.030
to spend one more day

12:53.100 --> 12:54.600
with her mother.

12:54.660 --> 12:56.360
I'm sure you'd feel
the same way

12:56.430 --> 13:00.330
if something happened
to your father.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.100
and iron sulfate imbedded
in the manubrium and the flesh.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.760
Both are found
in ballpoint ink.

13:05.830 --> 13:07.630
Ah. It's a homemade tattoo.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.230
Angela's working
on recreating the design.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.230
The tatHmm. You mean like
to have bea prison tat?

13:18.300 --> 13:20.060
No record
of her being in prison.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.200
In Russia,
prisoners make tattoo ink

13:22.260 --> 13:23.900
by burning the heel
of a shoe

13:23.960 --> 13:26.260
and mixing it
with soot and urine.

13:26.330 --> 13:28.430
This was a ballpoint pen rigged
with a sewing needle

13:28.500 --> 13:30.060
pushed down
so deep

13:30.130 --> 13:31.700
it penetrated her periosteum.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.760
Ah,you mean bone.

13:33.830 --> 13:36.660
Doesn't seem like
a very soccer mom thing to do.

13:36.730 --> 13:38.360
And... here we go.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.400
SAROYAN:
An inverted
pentagram?

13:41.460 --> 13:42.900
Devil worship.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.530
Mom had a little thing
going on the side with Satan?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.230
Oh,the burbs.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.760
There is a design in the
center that I can't quite get.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.860
HODGINS:
Wait. Wait,wait.

13:52.930 --> 13:55.730
Is that a fist?

13:55.800 --> 13:57.160
Fist?
BOOTH:
It's a fist.

13:57.230 --> 13:58.400
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah.

13:58.460 --> 14:00.000
Oh,my God,it is a fist.

14:00.060 --> 14:01.700
So she wasn't
Satan's old lady.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.160
She was in the NLA.

14:03.230 --> 14:04.460
The NLA?

14:04.530 --> 14:05.630
National Liberation Army.

14:05.700 --> 14:06.900
HODGINS:
Student radicals
in the '70s.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.360
Thought they could
change the world.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.800
Set off bombs in Army
recruiting offices,

14:11.860 --> 14:13.130
torched cop cars.
BOOTH:
Yeah,real
visionaries.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.160
They also shot
and killed a cop in '75.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.330
HODGINS:
That was the burglary.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.600
They broke
into the house

14:17.660 --> 14:19.860
of a defense contractor
to rip off his safe.

14:19.930 --> 14:21.700
Said it was
the people's money.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.700
Here. June Harris and her
boyfriend,Neal Watkins,

14:24.760 --> 14:26.860
were charged with the
murder but never found.

14:26.930 --> 14:29.230
FBI's been looking
for them for 30 years.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.500
And there they are.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.360
And our victim?

14:34.630 --> 14:35.860
It's the same woman.

14:35.930 --> 14:38.860
BRENNAN:
So our soccer mom

14:38.930 --> 14:45.400
was a killer.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.460
WOMAN:
 <i>People,</i>

14:50.530 --> 14:52.300
please tell me
that all your

14:52.360 --> 14:53.930
fancy-ass equipment

14:54.000 --> 14:55.860
is wrong.
(high-pitched beeping)

14:55.930 --> 14:57.930
BRENNAN:
You are not supposed
to be up here.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.460
Booth can shoot me later.

15:00.530 --> 15:03.030
This cannot be June Harris.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.000
BRENNAN:
But the dentals match.

15:05.060 --> 15:07.000
Angela's reconstruction matches.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.330
Amy Nash was June Harris.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.030
<i>Porquoi moi?</i>

15:10.100 --> 15:12.000
She couldn't have waited
four days

15:12.060 --> 15:14.760
to turn herself
into a charcoal briquette?

15:14.830 --> 15:16.660
I don't understand?

15:16.730 --> 15:17.830
Caroline,why are you here?

15:17.900 --> 15:19.700
June Harris was
turning herself in.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.030
I arranged

15:21.100 --> 15:22.600
with her attorney
for the surrender.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.000
He was going to
deliver her on Thursday

15:25.060 --> 15:26.800
after she said good-bye
to her family.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.100
What was the deal?

15:28.160 --> 15:29.600
Nine years.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.700
Nine years
for killing a cop?

15:31.760 --> 15:33.360
For turning herself in
and laying this

15:33.430 --> 15:35.330
all to rest,
and since

15:35.400 --> 15:36.560
she still maintained
her innocence,

15:36.630 --> 15:38.600
this was going to be
a tough case to prosecute.

15:38.660 --> 15:41.800
Sam Reilly was the lead
on this case for 30 years.

15:41.860 --> 15:43.660
He was okay with nine years?

15:43.730 --> 15:45.260
He doesn't know.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.660
Part of the deal.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.630
He wasn't to be consulted.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.400
Well,you know what?
It's okay to tell him now.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.160
I know Sam. He deserves
that much after 30 years.

15:52.230 --> 15:53.330
Up to you.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.860
You're the lead
now,<i>cherie.</i>

15:54.930 --> 15:56.560
You should bring
in Huntzinger.

15:56.630 --> 15:59.230
He was her attorney.

15:59.330 --> 16:01.360
I love Huntzinger. might know
Real old-time leftie.h

16:01.430 --> 16:03.060
Worked the Chicago
Seven trial.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.130
Sued Nixon,
the CIA,Bush...

16:06.200 --> 16:07.630
Okay,that's great--
let's get out of here

16:07.700 --> 16:10.030
before Hodgins gives him
the pinko medal of honor.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.430
Are you coming?
I can't.
Zack and I have

16:12.500 --> 16:14.560
to pull the rest
of the shrapnel
for the bomb tech,

16:14.630 --> 16:16.930
and then I have
to buy some socks for my dad.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.130
Leave her be,<i>cherie.</i>

16:18.200 --> 16:19.560
Absence makes the
heart grow fonder.

16:19.630 --> 16:20.730
Socks?

16:20.800 --> 16:22.230
MAN:
 <i>I have worked this case</i>

16:22.300 --> 16:24.060
for 30 years,
and you don't think

16:24.130 --> 16:25.400
I deserve
a phone call?

16:25.460 --> 16:26.960
It was part
of the deal.

16:27.030 --> 16:28.530
And you,Booth--
I trained you.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.400
You think this is right,
to blow me off like this?

16:31.460 --> 16:33.500
Well,I just got
thrown the case,Sam.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.760
Don't go
wailing on me.

16:34.830 --> 16:36.160
Damn lawyers.

16:36.230 --> 16:38.160
Working a case for 30 years,

16:38.230 --> 16:41.260
and you don't think
it deserves a damn phone call?

16:41.330 --> 16:42.660
Hey,I'm talking
to you.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.500
No,you're
yelling at me,

16:44.560 --> 16:46.360
and my ears are
starting to ring.

16:46.430 --> 16:48.230
Now,I'm sorry
that after 40 years

16:48.300 --> 16:51.100
as an agent for the FBI
you're still a little girl,

16:51.160 --> 16:54.230
but I'd like to find out
who killed June Harris,

16:54.300 --> 16:57.530
so how about you stop
whining and help?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.600
Okay,<i>cherie?</i>

17:02.600 --> 17:03.700
(door closes)

17:03.760 --> 17:05.160
So,how have you been,Sam?

17:05.230 --> 17:06.630
Shut up,Booth.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.359
CAROLINE:
 <i>What's in the bag,Leonard?</i>

17:08.430 --> 17:10.599
LEONARD:
Toothbrush,change
of underwear.

17:10.660 --> 17:13.060
You guys always find some reason
to toss me in the can.

17:13.130 --> 17:15.700
No belts,no laces.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.200
I'm ready.

17:17.260 --> 17:18.700
Yeah,great. Well,we just want

17:18.760 --> 17:21.200
to ask you a few questions
about June Harris' death.

17:21.260 --> 17:22.800
I loved June Harris.

17:22.859 --> 17:26.260
I loved what she stood for
and what she did with her life.

17:28.460 --> 17:31.200
NExcept maybe Neal Watkins.e.

17:31.260 --> 17:33.100
(laughing):
Yeah,you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

17:33.160 --> 17:34.630
Blame another revolutionary.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.760
Do you know where Watkins is?

17:36.830 --> 17:39.100
CAROLINE:
They were partners in crime.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.730
I don't think he would want
to risk June turning him in.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.700
You ever hear
of attorney-client privilege?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.630
Ever hear of obstruction
of justice?

17:46.700 --> 17:47.800
You know,a woman is dead.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.200
She's not a martyr
to her family,

17:49.260 --> 17:50.360
just someone they loved.

17:50.430 --> 17:51.960
If you can understand that.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.800
LEONARD:
Cooperating with the system
perpetuates that system.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.060
(sighs)
Yeah,yeah,yeah.

17:55.130 --> 17:56.560
And if the system
is corrupt...
Blah,blah.

17:56.630 --> 17:58.530
Blah,blah. So what's
next,Leonard?

17:58.600 --> 18:01.100
You going to warn Watkins
that we're onto him?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.630
You son of a...

18:02.700 --> 18:03.830
Sam! Sam,Sam,Sam!

18:03.900 --> 18:05.800
Watkins and Harris
are not heroes.
Hey,Sam.

18:05.860 --> 18:06.900
You want to see
how they changed society?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.100
Ask the kid
whose father they killed.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.260
I know that kid.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.000
He became a cop
just like his father.

18:12.060 --> 18:13.400
Very touching.
You son...

18:13.460 --> 18:14.630
Hey!
Get out of here!

18:14.700 --> 18:16.130
Hey,hey,hey,hey!

18:16.200 --> 18:17.060
You just hit a
federal agent,

18:17.130 --> 18:18.430
Mr. Huntzinger.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.760
Good thing
you brought your toothpaste.

18:19.830 --> 18:20.930
What a surprise.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.360
Lock me up to shut me up.

18:22.430 --> 18:23.600
You should be talking

18:23.660 --> 18:26.030
to that kid Valenti
instead of busting my ass.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.430
The pig comes to me
the other day.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.630
He wants to know where June is.

18:28.700 --> 18:29.800
He said he got a letter

18:29.860 --> 18:31.700
from her,as if
she'd write him

18:31.760 --> 18:36.130
or I'd give her up.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.900
A gift

18:37.960 --> 18:40.360
from your noble
son of a cop.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.760
Nice and soft.

18:45.830 --> 18:48.200
I'll be the best dressed
on cell block eight. Thanks.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.900
Sure.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.160
Honey... I'm sorry.

18:54.230 --> 18:55.200
For what?

18:56.760 --> 19:00.330
For... For being such
a disappointment as a father.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.000
You deserved better.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.260
And I should have told you
sooner.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.230
Well,that's it? Nothing?

19:11.300 --> 19:12.630
Well,what were you expecting?

19:12.700 --> 19:14.030
I agree with you.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.630
I was expecting some tears,
or a hug or something.

19:16.700 --> 19:17.960
I did apologize.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.760
Well,you didn't mean it?

19:20.830 --> 19:22.800
Of course I meant it.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.260
Listen,
under any objective standard,

19:24.330 --> 19:26.760
you have a horrible human being
for a father,

19:26.830 --> 19:28.430
but I-I'm trying to move on.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.160
I got caught
so that I could be with you.

19:31.230 --> 19:33.030
I was hoping
you'd meet me halfway.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.000
I'm here,aren't I?

19:36.930 --> 19:39.460
I...

19:39.530 --> 19:42.200
got you shampoo.

19:42.260 --> 19:45.030
Soap isn't good for your hair.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.200
Oh,nice.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.230
I... I don't want
to smell too good.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.060
That can be a problem
around here.

19:51.330 --> 19:52.700
There.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.130
See? It's better.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.560
Thanks.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.260
Sure.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.400
So,the prosecutor's going
to want to talk to you about me.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.500
It wouldn't hurt if you,uh,

20:06.560 --> 20:08.930
had some good things
to say about your old man.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.030
Might even offer
to testify on my behalf.

20:12.100 --> 20:14.100
Is that why
you finally apologized?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.260
What?

20:15.330 --> 20:16.530
To use me?

20:16.600 --> 20:17.730
Maybe you'd like me

20:17.800 --> 20:19.430
to alter
evidence now.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.700
That way I could join
the family business.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.760
How can you think that?
I don't know,Max.

20:23.830 --> 20:26.360
Maybe because I seem
to pass in and out of your life

20:26.430 --> 20:27.530
when it's most convenient.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.700
Maybe because you built

20:28.760 --> 20:31.000
a whole career using
your considerable

20:31.060 --> 20:32.230
charm to manipulate people.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.860
Listen,I know
that it's hard

20:33.930 --> 20:36.530
to trust me,I know,
and it's going to take some time

20:36.600 --> 20:37.860
to fix things,but we can...

20:37.930 --> 20:39.100
No! No!

20:39.160 --> 20:40.330
Some things break,

20:40.400 --> 20:42.260
and you can't put them
back together again.

20:42.330 --> 20:43.700
That's just the way it is.

20:43.760 --> 20:49.860
I was fine on my own,Max,
I was just fine.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.560
FROST:
 <i>Electrophoresis</i>

21:00.630 --> 21:02.360
and HPLC shows
potassium nitrate,

21:02.430 --> 21:03.830
charcoal and sulfur

21:03.900 --> 21:06.830
in a 75/15/ten ratio.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.530
Graphite glazed,
Triple F Goex--

21:08.600 --> 21:11.200
Sporting Grade.

21:11.260 --> 21:12.660
You are a constant surprise.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.700
Yes. Yes,I am.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.830
I don't know many people
who get as excited as I do

21:17.900 --> 21:20.500
about the chemical makeup
of explosives.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.060
Well... I...

21:22.130 --> 21:23.530
Complex molecular
structures.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.360
Hey,how's it coming with
the-the... the detonator?

21:26.430 --> 21:29.960
Seems to be a wristwatch.

21:30.030 --> 21:32.930
Pretty
Microscopic glass chips,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.760
probably the crystal.

21:34.830 --> 21:38.430
I'll,uh,take a look
at the composition,

21:38.500 --> 21:39.600
see if I can...

21:40.830 --> 21:42.200
...locate a manufacturer.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.360
Great.

21:44.430 --> 21:48.160
So,where do you want me
to dump this junk?

21:48.230 --> 21:50.600
You're tossing the air filter?

21:50.660 --> 21:52.230
I tested it
for explosive residue.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.560
There wasn't any.

21:53.630 --> 21:55.130
It was blown free
from the car.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.300
Yeah,even better.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.560
Do you have
any ideare?

22:01.600 --> 22:04.200
Don't touch my things.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.630
Watch her.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.660
SAROYAN:
 <i>She was shot,too?</i>

22:10.730 --> 22:12.200
The injury
presented itself

22:12.260 --> 22:13.530
when I was
removing shrapnel

22:13.600 --> 22:15.030
from the reconstructed
shoulder.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.660
Well,you're sure it's not
from the bomb

22:16.730 --> 22:18.130
or the fire?
No.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.960
The fragments are lead
in a copper alloy coating.

22:21.030 --> 22:22.160
Yep,that's a bullet.

22:22.230 --> 22:23.560
I didn't find any
dried blood

22:23.630 --> 22:25.430
on her clothes.
When was she shot?

22:25.500 --> 22:27.300
Damage from the blast makes it
difficult to tell

22:27.360 --> 22:28.500
when the shooting occurred.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.130
I'm going to check
the remodeling

22:30.200 --> 22:31.300
to estimate a time.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.960
Hitting the top of the shoulder

22:33.030 --> 22:34.630
wouldn't be a severe injury.

22:34.700 --> 22:37.730
She could bandage herself
and still be ambulatory.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.100
y walk
around instead;

22:41.160 --> 22:43.000
I wouldn't fire you.
"Walk around"

22:43.060 --> 22:45.830
implies aimlessness
which I'm not able to determine.

22:45.900 --> 22:49.000
Can't believe I still ask
these things.

22:49.060 --> 22:50.330
Send everything
you've got

22:50.400 --> 22:51.830
s
at the FBI.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.500
I'll inform Dr. Brennan.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.600
REILLY:
 <i>Does not</i>

22:54.660 --> 22:56.330
make any sense.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.400
The van was rigged
to blow up,why
shoot her?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.430
Well,until we see what
ballistics determines,

23:00.500 --> 23:01.760
it's absurd to speculate.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.630
Speculating is kind
of what we do here.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.030
Listen,Danny Valenti
is a cop.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.730
June Harris murdered his father.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.900
He has a gun.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.100
He's a good kid,Booth.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.130
He didn't do it.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.400
But that is meaningless
speculation.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.030
Is she really necessary?

23:14.100 --> 23:15.200
She's my partner.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.260
Mentors often feel
threatened

23:16.330 --> 23:17.600
when their students
surpasses them.

23:17.660 --> 23:19.160
Bones!
Well,it's true,Booth.

23:19.230 --> 23:20.700
Change can be difficult
to accept

23:20.760 --> 23:23.460
||
whether it comes in the form
of a revolutionary

23:23.530 --> 23:25.130
or the simple
passage of time.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.030
If she were a guy,
I'd deck her.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.260
Right.
You know,that
distinction

23:28.330 --> 23:29.500
is no longer
necessary,

23:29.560 --> 23:31.300
but I wouldn't
recommend it.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.160
Go,Sam. Thank you.

23:34.230 --> 23:35.830
<i>Officer Valentcredit card reco</i>

23:35.900 --> 23:39.660
that,uh,you bought gas
near June Harris' home.

23:39.730 --> 23:41.360
I didn't know where she lived.

23:41.430 --> 23:43.560
Just the town from the postmark
on the letter.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.300
Her apology letter.

23:46.530 --> 23:47.660
She should've had the nerve

23:47.730 --> 23:49.300
to come talk to me
face to face.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.630
So that's when you went
to Huntzinger.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.460
Yeah.
And hit him.

23:52.530 --> 23:55.130
He protects people like her.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.200
That's his job.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.760
I was five years old
when my father was killed.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.660
My mother told me he
wasn't coming home again.

24:02.730 --> 24:04.100
I didn't believe her.

24:04.160 --> 24:08.700
I sat by that window,waiting,
every day for months.

24:10.430 --> 24:12.360
You seem be pretty angry
about that.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.930
Why didn't you tell me
what you were going to do?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.830
You'd try and talk me out of it.

24:18.900 --> 24:19.960
Did you know

24:20.030 --> 24:21.200
how little time she was going
to serve?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.360
Because that
might make

24:22.430 --> 24:23.660
someone take matters
into their own hands.

24:23.730 --> 24:24.700
I'm a cop,man.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.860
I didn't blow her up.

24:25.930 --> 24:27.030
Booth...
Sam.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.200
It's my investigation.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.230
Officer Valenti,

24:29.300 --> 24:30.230
I going to need
your gun.
Why?

24:30.300 --> 24:31.230
Be

24:31.300 --> 24:32.360
was shot before she died.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.360
We'd like to make sure
the bullet didn't come

24:34.430 --> 24:35.530
from your gun.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.000
You going to let them do this
to me,Sam?

24:38.060 --> 24:40.630
It's just a formality,Danny.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.630
Then let's be formal.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.900
Sam?
Ballistics

24:50.960 --> 24:54.430
says the bullet was <i>not</i>
a match for Danny's gun.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.030
Booth should have that
report first.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.260
He's the lead.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.130
You know,Booth,
she must be really good in bed,

25:00.200 --> 25:01.600
because I can't see
any other reason

25:01.660 --> 25:03.030
you keep her around here.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.900
I am. Very good,but...

25:04.950 --> 25:07.560
Booth has no direct knowledge
of that fact.

25:07.630 --> 25:09.430
Okay,okay,let's all stay
focused here,people,okay?

25:09.500 --> 25:10.930
Sam,you know what?
You should never...

25:11.000 --> 25:12.560
But it was a match for the gun

25:12.630 --> 25:14.560
that killed Danny's father
30 years ago.

25:14.630 --> 25:16.000
Right,the same gun
that was registered

25:16.060 --> 25:18.000
to Harris' old boyfriend,
Watkins.

25:18.060 --> 25:19.730
But it was never found.

25:19.800 --> 25:23.160
Everyone we interviewed
at the time

25:23.230 --> 25:25.030
without talking to Watkins
mafirst.ov

25:25.100 --> 25:26.800
I told you,we need to find him.

25:26.860 --> 25:27.960
Yeah,okay,we
will,Sam.

25:28.030 --> 25:29.560
You just got to give
me some room here.

25:29.630 --> 25:31.560
Hey,hey,Booth.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.730
Don't cut me out.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.500
I've worked my whole career
for this.

25:38.130 --> 25:41.830
As soon as I find something out,
I'll let you know,Sam.

25:43.860 --> 25:46.460
Come on,Bones.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.230
I remember seeing a picture
of him before.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.230
I was going through some
old photographs,

25:58.300 --> 26:00.230
cleaning out a closet.

26:00.300 --> 26:02.700
Amy said it was an old
boyfriend.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.360
Mmm.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.300
They keep in contact?
No.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.300
I mean,she would've told me.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.300
Why?

26:09.360 --> 26:11.100
You don't think
that...

26:11.160 --> 26:12.900
Did he kill her?

26:12.960 --> 26:15.360
How long did you know
about your wife's real identity?

26:15.430 --> 26:17.030
Yeah,how long?
I only found out

26:17.100 --> 26:17.960
a couple of weeks ago.

26:18.030 --> 26:20.600
Why didn't
you tell me?

26:21.530 --> 26:22.760
What,you didn't think

26:22.830 --> 26:24.630
I deserved to know
about my own mother?

26:24.700 --> 26:26.060
She didn't want me
to tell you.

26:26.130 --> 26:27.430
She wanted to do it
herself.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.700
Your wife never talked
about her past?

26:29.760 --> 26:32.130
She used to say only the future
was important,

26:32.200 --> 26:34.630
what we could do is change
the world.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.300
They didn't agree on how.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.660
Celia was a,a bit conservative

26:39.730 --> 26:40.730
for Amy.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.060
That never mattered.

26:42.130 --> 26:43.330
She wasn't some

26:43.400 --> 26:45.960
crazy radical
to me.

26:46.030 --> 26:48.000
She was my mom.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.330
You must have been
relieved she got
such a great deal.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.960
What deal?

26:52.030 --> 26:53.300
She didn't tell you?

26:53.360 --> 26:54.460
She mentioned she was thinking

26:54.530 --> 26:55.800
of talking to a federal
prosecutor,

26:55.860 --> 26:57.230
but I talked her out of it.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.960
Well,you do know,
that it's a felony

26:59.030 --> 27:00.960
aiding and abetting
a,a fugitive.

27:01.030 --> 27:02.960
You want to charge me? Fine.

27:03.030 --> 27:05.960
But saving my family
doesn't feel like a crime.

27:06.030 --> 27:09.500
Amy was a,a good mother,
a wonderful wife.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.960
Do you mind if we
take a look around,

27:12.030 --> 27:13.160
see if there's
any evidence

27:13.230 --> 27:14.830
linking your wife
to Watkins?

27:14.900 --> 27:16.830
The house is yours.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.600
Come on,sweetheart.

27:18.660 --> 27:21.400
The only reason we found any
lead or copper in the shoulder

27:21.460 --> 27:23.060
was because of the blast.

27:23.130 --> 27:25.400
There was advanced
bone remodeling.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.700
So it's a very
old injury.
Yes.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.260
Bone had completely grown
over it.

27:30.330 --> 27:32.530
And since it was the same gun
that killed the policeman

27:32.600 --> 27:33.760
and was never recovered,

27:33.830 --> 27:35.830
I think we can assume
June Harris was shot

27:35.900 --> 27:37.160
during the robbery.

27:37.230 --> 27:40.630
I also found
microscopic lead particles

27:40.700 --> 27:42.630
on the metacarpals
of the left hand

27:42.700 --> 27:45.000
with the same degree of
remodeling at the shoulder.

27:45.060 --> 27:46.800
Another gunshot?
No.

27:46.860 --> 27:47.900
The same one.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.700
The metals are an
identical match.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.430
So,she was shot

27:51.500 --> 27:53.430
in the hand and the shoulder
with the same bullet?

27:53.500 --> 27:55.200
Is that even possible?

27:55.260 --> 27:58.200
Angela could give us
a scenario that
could tell us.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.000
I'm creating a trajectory
analysis factoring in

28:00.060 --> 28:02.030
both the hand
and the shoulder.

28:02.100 --> 28:04.530
These are photos
from the crime scene

28:04.600 --> 28:06.560
30 years ago.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.330
That's the home of the
defense contractor,
Gerald Locklear,

28:11.400 --> 28:13.600
where the NLA
burglary occurred.

28:13.660 --> 28:15.260
June Harris and
Neal Watkins

28:15.330 --> 28:16.530
were in Locklear's
office

28:16.600 --> 28:18.030
at the back of
the house.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.930
The original FBI photos
were crude,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.260
based on fingerprints
and scuff marks on the floor.

28:22.330 --> 28:23.800
It assumes

28:23.860 --> 28:27.030
that June stood guard,
while Neal emptied the safe.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.930
When Officer Valenti
walks in

28:30.000 --> 28:35.030
surprising them,June fires,
killing Valenti.

28:35.100 --> 28:37.360
But that wouldn't
her injuries.

28:37.400 --> 28:41.800
Unless June emptied

28:41.860 --> 28:43.560
stood guard.
Exactly.

28:43.630 --> 28:45.560
Neal aims at Officer Valenti,

28:45.630 --> 28:47.530
but June steps between them,

28:47.600 --> 28:49.360
raises her hands to stop Neal,

28:49.430 --> 28:51.030
but he fires.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.530
She was trying

28:52.600 --> 28:54.500
to protect the policeman.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.500
June Harris was telling
the truth.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.600
She didn't kill Valenti.

28:58.660 --> 29:00.330
Neal Watkins did.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.360
HODGINS:
He also made
the bomb.

29:02.430 --> 29:03.900
The watch used to make the timer

29:03.960 --> 29:05.860
was coated with
a volatilized pigment

29:05.930 --> 29:08.700
used by the Sawyer Time Company.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.630
BRENNAN:
An American Flag
watch?

29:11.700 --> 29:13.060
Nice ironic touch.
Watkins

29:13.130 --> 29:14.500
always used the same type
of watch

29:14.560 --> 29:15.830
when making bombs for the NLA.

29:15.900 --> 29:16.900
It was his signature.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.060
They found traces
of them

29:18.130 --> 29:19.660
at an ROTC
headquarters,

29:19.730 --> 29:22.700
the IRS office...
June told him

29:22.760 --> 29:25.060
shHe wasn't going to let that
thappen,so he made a new bomb

29:25.130 --> 29:27.200
using an old watch
and killed her.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.860
And he left a message for anyone

29:28.930 --> 29:30.560
who thought the revolution
was over.

29:30.630 --> 29:32.400
Sounds like a bad ex-boyfriend.

29:32.460 --> 29:33.560
Well,that's
assuming

29:33.630 --> 29:34.960
she was in contact
with him.

29:35.030 --> 29:36.460
And we have no way
of knowing

29:36.530 --> 29:37.700
where that would've
taken place

29:37.760 --> 29:39.030
if she had seen him.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.030
Not so sure about that.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.060
I have her air filter.

29:43.130 --> 29:45.900
It's like an entomological GPS.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.700
What's taking Hodgins so long?

29:48.760 --> 29:50.730
It's an exacting process.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.860
Ah.

29:51.930 --> 29:53.000
Thank you.

29:53.060 --> 29:54.830
So,um,

29:54.900 --> 29:56.460
how'd your dad like his socks?

29:56.530 --> 29:58.730
Fine.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.600
That's sort of a way to start
a conversation there,Bones.

30:03.660 --> 30:04.930
I know.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.300
Yeah,look,I'm,

30:07.360 --> 30:10.460
I should never have gotten
in the middle of all this.

30:10.530 --> 30:13.560
I-I'm sorry,I was just,
I'm just trying to help.

30:15.630 --> 30:19.060
He wanted me to testify
on his behalf.

30:19.130 --> 30:21.060
He just wants
to use me.

30:21.130 --> 30:22.500
Well,he's a con man,
Bones.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.160
That doesn't mean
that he doesn't love you.

30:24.230 --> 30:26.300
He's just looking
for a little payback.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.800
Payback?
Yeah,he's thinking

30:27.860 --> 30:29.960
he got arrested so he could
spend some more time with you,

30:30.030 --> 30:31.630
I mean you could at least return
the favor

30:31.700 --> 30:33.000
by doing something nice for him.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.000
Yeah,I'm not sure
I want a father

30:35.060 --> 30:36.460
who's always keeping score.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.460
Yeah,sounds like you are,too.

30:41.530 --> 30:43.430
You know what?

30:43.500 --> 30:45.130
You're right.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.460
This is none of your business.

30:46.530 --> 30:47.460
You know what,
Bones?

30:47.530 --> 30:48.730
You're never forgive yourself

30:48.830 --> 30:50.400
if you don't cut the guy some
slack

30:50.460 --> 30:52.060
just because you were afraid
to get hurt.

30:52.130 --> 30:54.900
What the hell is taking Hodgins
so long?

30:54.960 --> 30:57.230
Where's the bombshell
from the bomb squad?

30:57.300 --> 30:59.230
She went back
to the FBI

30:59.300 --> 31:00.730
to catalogue
evidence.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.260
Thank God.

31:02.330 --> 31:03.600
She was driving me crazy.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.860
It was just science
all the time.

31:05.930 --> 31:09.260
Then she tries to destroy
perfectly good evidence.

31:09.330 --> 31:11.060
What about the breasts?

31:11.130 --> 31:14.060
I started thinking about them

31:14.130 --> 31:17.330
dragging on the floor
when she's 70.

31:22.760 --> 31:25.700
How are you doing?

31:25.760 --> 31:27.300
Well,that burned paper

31:27.360 --> 31:28.730
is a letter that she wrote.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.360
So I'm using
the Spectral Comparator

31:30.430 --> 31:32.230
to locate the ink particles.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.900
Cool.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.560
The,uh,computer is rendering
the content now.

31:36.630 --> 31:37.930
So...
Mm-hmm.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.360
You?

31:39.430 --> 31:42.260
I found pollen.
Mmm.

31:42.330 --> 31:44.260
Most of it Pinus appalachiana--

31:44.330 --> 31:47.630
Shenandoah pine...

31:47.700 --> 31:49.860
which is only found on
Shenandoah Mountain

31:49.930 --> 31:52.500
in West Virginia.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.300
There was also crushed
Pendleton

31:54.360 --> 31:56.000
leatherflower in
the tire treads,

31:56.060 --> 31:57.560
which is only found

31:57.630 --> 31:59.900
here in the shale barrens
along the upper Potomac.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.330
It is very secluded.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.000
Between the towns
of Hendersonville

32:03.060 --> 32:07.900
and Maple Flats.
Booth!

32:07.960 --> 32:10.930
That's nice work,
Hodgins.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.330
You know,my computer

32:12.400 --> 32:14.500
is going to be rendering
for a while.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.760
You want to go
to the medieval storage room?

32:24.130 --> 32:26.800
Oh.

32:26.860 --> 32:30.360
Booth,what the hell is
taking you so long?!

32:30.430 --> 32:33.730
BRENNAN:
 <i>You told Reilly</i>
 <i>where Watkins is?</i>

32:33.800 --> 32:35.100
Yeah,he's meeting
us there.
He's too emotional.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.400
This is his case;
he's invested.

32:37.460 --> 32:38.500
He's irrational.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.630
Probably male menopause.

32:39.700 --> 32:40.830
What?!
He's a good man.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.160
And you know what?
There's no such thing.

32:42.230 --> 32:43.400
That is a sexist myth.

32:43.460 --> 32:44.560
Factually,

32:44.630 --> 32:46.560
hormone production drops
in your 50s,

32:46.630 --> 32:48.400
sexual desire decreases,

32:48.460 --> 32:50.100
you have to deal with aof muscle mass,

32:50.160 --> 32:52.030
erectile dysfunction...
All right,hey,
let's just

32:52.100 --> 32:53.230
keep the conversation up,
shall we?

32:53.300 --> 32:55.060
And there's evidence
that certain men

32:55.130 --> 32:57.000
become very unstable.
Do you want me

32:57.060 --> 32:58.430
to start talking
about your father again?

32:58.500 --> 32:59.530
You're very testy.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.560
You know,and 35.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.200
I'm only 35.
Okay,

33:02.260 --> 33:03.200
okay.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.460
They have blue
pills for that.

33:09.130 --> 33:11.960
No,I don't like this.

33:12.030 --> 33:13.330
It's too quiet.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.460
Wasn't Reilly
supposed to meet us?

33:14.530 --> 33:16.500
(cocking gun):
Yeah.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.800
Gee,why didn't you
bring the big one?

33:48.360 --> 33:49.460
BOOTH:
Easy,Sam.

33:49.530 --> 33:50.930
Put the gun down.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.030
Step away from the body.

33:52.100 --> 33:54.930
Booth...

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
look at him.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.830
He did it to himself.

33:59.900 --> 34:03.160
I didn't do this,Booth.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.460
SAROYAN:
.38 caliber slug.

34:32.530 --> 34:36.060
Matches the revolver
found at the scene.

34:36.130 --> 34:37.730
Now,positioning is consistent

34:37.830 --> 34:39.760
with a self-inflicted
gunshot wound,

34:39.830 --> 34:41.659
but could easily
have been staged.

34:41.730 --> 34:44.060
Zack,bring up
that hand X-ray.

34:45.159 --> 34:46.960
Look at this.

34:47.030 --> 34:48.360
Asymmetric narrowing

34:48.429 --> 34:50.530
on the first
metacarpophalangeal joints.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.929
Ulnar deviation,
barely discernible.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.260
Would you like my finger,
Dr. Brennan?

34:55.330 --> 34:57.760
Please.
SAROYAN:
What are you two thinking?

34:57.830 --> 35:01.960
Neal Watkins had rheumatoid
arthritis in his hands.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.660
This would approximate

35:06.730 --> 35:10.100
the strength of his
arthritic finger. Pull.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.230
Harder.

35:13.300 --> 35:15.100
I'm trying,Dr. Brennan.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.600
Watkins' fine motor function

35:18.660 --> 35:23.300
would be no greater than Zack's
gauze-wrapped finger.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.460
Neal Watkins wasn't able
He couldn't have shot himself.

35:25.530 --> 35:27.130
If he couldn't
pull the trigger,

35:27.200 --> 35:28.760
he wouldn't have
the manual dexterity

35:28.830 --> 35:31.030
to assemble the bomb either.

35:31.100 --> 35:34.360
There's one man who knew
exactly how Neal made his bombs.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.200
The same man who worked
the case for 30 years.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.300
I'll call Booth.

35:44.730 --> 35:45.830
Dr. Brennan determined

35:45.900 --> 35:48.330
that... it wasn't a suicide.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.030
What?

35:50.100 --> 35:51.530
The gun was a plant.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.660
Wouldn't be the first time

35:52.730 --> 35:54.400
an agent planted
a gun,would it?

35:54.460 --> 35:56.930
Forensics searched
the house and,uh...

35:57.000 --> 35:58.860
they determined that there
was not enough evidence

35:58.930 --> 36:01.330
to suggest that Watkins made
the bomb that killed Harris.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.360
What about the watch?
That's the thing,Sam.

36:03.430 --> 36:05.660
It turns out that two
Sawyer Company American flag

36:05.730 --> 36:09.000
watches were confiscated
in a '74 NLA raid.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.660
We checked the
evidence locker.

36:10.730 --> 36:13.360
A lot of things are missing,
including a watch.

36:13.430 --> 36:15.800
REILLY:
It was a dog case,Booth.

36:15.860 --> 36:18.160
That crap was moved
off-site years ago.

36:18.230 --> 36:21.500
You know what happens
during a move.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.560
CAROLINE:
So you had a
30-year obsession,

36:23.630 --> 36:25.830
but you didn't keep
track of your evidence?

36:25.900 --> 36:27.730
You have a good
service record,<i>cherie.</i>

36:27.800 --> 36:29.160
We could make a deal.

36:29.230 --> 36:33.630
Look,

36:33.700 --> 36:37.730
but there is a real
killer out there.

36:37.800 --> 36:40.500
Look,I understand,Sam.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.000
I do.

36:42.060 --> 36:44.000
I think...

36:45.600 --> 36:47.530
...you should find
yourself a lawyer.

36:51.830 --> 36:53.530
I was cataloguing
the watch debris

36:53.600 --> 36:56.300
and noticed that the oxidation
and bacterial erosion

36:56.360 --> 36:58.330
of the metal was
inconsistent with watches

36:58.400 --> 37:00.400
that would have been stored
in evidence for 30 years.

37:00.460 --> 37:02.900
But weren't the watches
discontinued after '76?

37:02.960 --> 37:05.530
Yes,but I found a few available
online for collectors...

37:05.600 --> 37:06.700
still sealed.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.030
You traced one to a buyer?

37:08.100 --> 37:09.160
I didn't have to.

37:09.230 --> 37:10.900
Since the watch
was 30 years old,

37:10.960 --> 37:12.860
the bomber had
to put in a new battery.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.560
He left behind a thumbprint.

37:14.630 --> 37:15.960
The casing

37:16.030 --> 37:17.700
protected it during the blast.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.530
I asked the Bureau
to run the print.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.700
The letter has
finished rendering.

37:21.760 --> 37:24.930
It's not addressed to Watkins.

37:32.060 --> 37:34.500
BRENNAN'S VOICE:
 <i>"Dear Celia,</i>

37:34.560 --> 37:36.800
<i>"I've done terrible things</i>
 <i>in my life.</i>

37:36.860 --> 37:39.330
<i>"Things I can't change.</i>

37:39.400 --> 37:42.330
<i>"I know how much pain</i>
 <i>this will cause you,</i>

37:42.400 --> 37:46.330
<i>"but never forget</i>
 <i>how much I love you.</i>

37:46.400 --> 37:48.500
<i>"I know we didn't</i>
 <i>always agree on how,</i>

37:48.560 --> 37:51.330
<i>"but we both hoped</i>
 <i>for the same thing:</i>

37:51.400 --> 37:53.660
<i>a just world."</i>

37:53.730 --> 37:55.500
The funeral's today?

37:55.560 --> 37:58.100
Yeah.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.760
They seem like every other
normal grieving family.

38:00.830 --> 38:02.800
It's never what it seems,is it?

38:04.330 --> 38:07.030
Mr. Nash,you're under arrest

38:07.100 --> 38:08.600
for the murder
of June Harris,

38:08.660 --> 38:10.330
aka Amy Nash.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.400
That's crazy.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.200
I'm sorry,Celia.

38:14.260 --> 38:15.760
We know about the watch.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.900
<i>"Even though I didn't fire</i>

38:18.960 --> 38:20.900
<i>"the gun that took</i>
 <i>that man's life,</i>

38:20.960 --> 38:22.900
<i>"I have to take</i>
 <i>responsibility for it</i>

38:22.960 --> 38:24.800
<i>and for my cowardice</i>
 <i>hiding all these years."</i>

38:24.860 --> 38:27.400
I caught her
sneaking out one night.

38:27.460 --> 38:28.900
She had been seeing him.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.600
She betrayed me,Celia.

38:31.660 --> 38:33.260
She betrayed us.
(handcuffs tightening)

38:33.330 --> 38:35.760
How could you do this?

38:35.830 --> 38:37.160
25 years,I believed
she loved us,

38:37.230 --> 38:38.630
but she used us
to keep her cover.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.730
BOOTH:
Let's go.

38:40.800 --> 38:44.260
<i>"I tried to spare you</i>
 <i>and your father pain.</i>

38:44.330 --> 38:46.400
<i>"I know what your father</i>
 <i>thought when he caught me going</i>

38:46.460 --> 38:49.130
<i>to see Neal,but I would rather</i>
 <i>die than betray your father."</i>

38:49.200 --> 38:57.660
She was trying t
to surrender,too.

38:57.730 --> 39:01.160
She was trying to do
the right thing,Daddy.

39:01.230 --> 39:03.260
Let's go.

39:03.330 --> 39:04.760
You've got the right
to remain silent.

39:04.860 --> 39:06.130
Anything you say,can
and will be used...

39:06.200 --> 39:08.260
<i>"If I've learned anything,</i>

39:08.330 --> 39:10.460
<i>"it's that we can</i>
 <i>never let the chaos</i>

39:10.530 --> 39:14.030
<i>"and injustice make us</i>
 <i>so blind with anger</i>

39:14.100 --> 39:16.330
<i>"that we become part</i>
 <i>of the problem.</i>

39:16.400 --> 39:19.160
(car door closes)

39:19.230 --> 39:22.000
<i>"Understanding,compassion,</i>

39:22.060 --> 39:23.860
<i>"kindness and love</i>

39:23.930 --> 39:27.400
<i>"are the only true</i>
 <i>revolutionary ideals.</i>

39:27.460 --> 39:30.130
<i>"When we compromise those</i>
 <i>we become</i>

39:30.200 --> 39:34.000
<i>"what we despise,</i>
 <i>and we lose our humanity.</i>

39:35.600 --> 39:37.300
<i>"The world might see my legacy</i>

39:37.360 --> 39:40.260
<i>"as one of violence</i>
 <i>and destruction,</i>

39:40.330 --> 39:42.960
<i>"but I know that you are</i>
 <i>my real legacy,</i>

39:43.030 --> 39:47.360
<i>and for that I will be</i>
 <i>thankful every day."</i>

39:54.360 --> 39:56.630
I... I wasn't sure I'd
ever see you again.

39:58.360 --> 39:59.800
I thought maybe we could see

39:59.860 --> 40:02.630
if we remember
that card game.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.700
Yeah,sure.

40:09.560 --> 40:13.960
You know,I've kept this bottle
of single malt in my desk

40:14.030 --> 40:16.000
since '75.

40:16.060 --> 40:18.500
I always said
when we put this case to bed,

40:18.560 --> 40:19.800
I'd open it.

40:21.430 --> 40:24.360
I'd like you to help me
with that,Booth.

40:24.430 --> 40:27.560
Listen,Sam,I...

40:27.630 --> 40:29.400
I want to apologize.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.600
Hey...
(cork pops)

40:31.660 --> 40:33.930
I would've done
the same thing myself.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.600
Well,maybe not
quite the same thing.

40:40.030 --> 40:42.500
I would've slapped me
around a little bit.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.760
To the changing of the guard.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.430
How much scotch
did you drink?

41:19.500 --> 41:21.100
Oh,just enough.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.630
You know,I would've
invited you,

41:22.700 --> 41:24.960
but,Reilly,he just...

41:25.030 --> 41:27.360
Wow,he doesn't like you.

41:27.430 --> 41:29.700
I understand.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.130
I'm sorry,was that rude?

41:31.200 --> 41:36.260
Not from someone
who's been drinking.

41:36.330 --> 41:37.300
You know,
I love this plI love it.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.760
I love this country.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.860
You know,
I'll tell you something,

41:39.930 --> 41:42.300
if I was working law enforcement

41:42.360 --> 41:45.130
back in the day when they
threw all that tea,

41:45.200 --> 41:46.930
all right,in the harbor,
I'm good.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.200
All right,I'm good,
I would've rounded

41:48.260 --> 41:51.060
everybody up,
and we'd still be English.

41:51.130 --> 41:52.600
You think?
Yep.

41:52.660 --> 41:55.230
Yep,I definitely...

41:59.260 --> 42:00.700
I saw my father.

42:00.760 --> 42:04.500
Wow,I didn't think that
you were gonna do that.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.000
As an anthropologist,

42:06.060 --> 42:09.730
I accept change
as the natural order of things.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.360
But with him,I didn't
allow for transformation.

42:12.430 --> 42:14.000
You know,I predicated
his behavior

42:14.060 --> 42:16.400
based on a set of
outmoded preconceptions.

42:16.460 --> 42:18.160
It wasn't rational.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.960
Wow,I didn't get any of that.

42:22.030 --> 42:23.860
If I was conducting

42:23.930 --> 42:26.860
an objective experiment
on my father,

42:26.930 --> 42:28.260
observing his behavior,

42:28.330 --> 42:34.930
I'd... have to conclude
that he loves me.

42:36.860 --> 42:38.800
Hmm,whyWe played cards.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.960
Cool.

42:41.030 --> 42:42.660
I killed him.

42:42.730 --> 42:46.230
Good for you.
