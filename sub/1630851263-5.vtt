00:23.110 --> 00:24.720
<i>♪ Teen Titans, go</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:30.030
The clock is ticking, George.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.902
Our pitch
for the new Teen Titans
is due in less than 24 hours.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.686
What do we have so far?

00:34.730 --> 00:37.167
The same thing we had
five minutes ago, Marv.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.603
Squat! Zip!

00:38.647 --> 00:39.909
Zero!

00:39.952 --> 00:42.781
- Well, it's a start.
- Not really.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.740
This assignment isn't easy.

00:44.783 --> 00:48.483
The Teen Titans
have been around
in various forms since 1964.

00:48.526 --> 00:51.312
Now we have to come up with
a new idea to reinvent them,

00:51.355 --> 00:55.707
and save DC Comics
from certain financial doom!

00:55.751 --> 00:57.013
No pressure.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.885
We need a fresh take,

00:59.929 --> 01:02.105
something that
will breathe life
into these characters.

01:02.149 --> 01:05.978
Teen Titans. Teen Titans.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.633
Teen Tit... I've got it.

01:08.677 --> 01:09.895
Hit me with it.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.897
What if they're
super muscular...

01:12.985 --> 01:14.074
super ripped,

01:15.336 --> 01:16.685
super tight?

01:17.990 --> 01:20.210
<i>The Teen Tight-Hands!</i>

01:22.169 --> 01:24.867
<i>Deep underground,
in the cobble tunnel,</i>

01:24.910 --> 01:26.956
<i>our superheroes get pumped.</i>

01:26.999 --> 01:29.219
Yeah, Tight-Hands!

01:29.263 --> 01:31.003
Lookin' tight.

01:31.047 --> 01:34.790
The tightness I am feeling
is at maximum levels.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.100
Yeah, Ravhand, flex that flexor.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.406
Yeah, Cyhand, yeah!

01:43.625 --> 01:45.757
Yeah, baby!

01:45.801 --> 01:48.064
We're the tightest, hands down!

01:48.108 --> 01:49.326
Yeah!

01:52.112 --> 01:54.288
It's the emergency hand signal.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.420
We must lend a helping hand.

01:56.464 --> 01:59.119
Tight-Hands,
to the Flying Valhands.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.124
Yeah!

02:07.562 --> 02:11.043
<i>Meanwhile,
at the Jump City bridge,
panic is being wreaked</i>

02:11.087 --> 02:13.785
<i>by the arch nemesis
of the Teen Tight-Hands,</i>

02:13.829 --> 02:16.005
<i>The Atomic Toe!</i>

02:16.048 --> 02:17.528
<i>No, Mr. Frostbite.</i>

02:17.572 --> 02:19.835
<i>No, no, no, The Clipper.
Yeah!</i>

02:21.532 --> 02:24.100
Look, The Clipper
and his army of Clippertrons

02:24.144 --> 02:27.364
are clipping the cables
to the Jump City bridge.

02:27.408 --> 02:30.846
Ooh! You gotta hand it to him.
That's pretty under-handed.

02:30.889 --> 02:33.718
It's time to get a handle
on the situation.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.938
Tight-Hands, yeah!

02:37.766 --> 02:41.204
Teen Tight-Hands?
You'll never stop me.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.380
Clippertrons, clip 'em!

02:45.252 --> 02:47.167
Fist grip. Yeah!

02:47.210 --> 02:50.213
The rock, the paper,
the scissors.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.519
Yeah!

02:51.562 --> 02:54.739
Flick, flick,
flick, flick. Yeah!

02:54.783 --> 02:56.654
Supersonic snap.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.744
Power punch. Yeah!

03:01.920 --> 03:03.574
No!

03:03.618 --> 03:06.186
You won't be slipping
through my fingers this time.

03:06.229 --> 03:09.493
Looks like we got
the upper hand.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.539
Tight-Hands, high-five!

03:11.582 --> 03:15.195
Yeah!

03:18.285 --> 03:21.462
That is literally
the worst idea we've ever had.

03:21.505 --> 03:24.595
It might actually be
the worst idea anyone ever had.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.859
It's all part of
the creative process.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.427
Gotta dig through the dirt
to get to the gold.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.562
But the Teen Titans have
been around for two decades.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.781
I feel like we're trying
to reinvent the wheel here.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.784
That's why we're here
in our favorite diner
taking a pitstop.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.919
Hmm. Wheel.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.051
Pitstop.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.836
What is it, George?
What have you got?

03:47.879 --> 03:51.796
What if... the Teen Titans

03:51.840 --> 03:54.495
are a superhero Formula One
pit crew?

03:58.977 --> 04:00.762
<i>Faster than a speeding bullet</i>

04:00.805 --> 04:02.285
<i>shot from a speeding car.</i>

04:03.808 --> 04:05.419
Pit Crew Titans, go, go, go!

04:13.644 --> 04:16.212
We're the fastest pit crew
in the sport of motors.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.083
1.81 seconds, baby.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.133
I'm getting a distress call.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.178
Pit Crew Titans, go, go, go!

04:26.222 --> 04:28.050
<i>Meanwhile, in Jump City,</i>

04:28.093 --> 04:30.226
<i>a crime is in progress
at the National Bank.</i>

04:31.793 --> 04:32.881
Jack it up!

04:35.492 --> 04:36.537
Hose 'em down.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.675
Roll 'em out.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.983
1.81 seconds, baby.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.551
I'm getting
another distress call.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.988
Pit Crew Titans, go, go, go!

04:53.031 --> 04:55.817
- Give me the bag, lady.
- Help, help!

04:59.211 --> 05:00.387
Jack it up.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.869
- Wheels locked.
- Helmet on.

05:04.913 --> 05:05.914
Go, go, go!

05:07.524 --> 05:09.831
1.81 seconds, baby.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.051
It's Batman.
He forgot his lunch.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.272
Let's move.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.969
- Bread.
- Ham.

05:18.535 --> 05:19.535
Cheese.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.365
Veggies.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.541
Spread.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.066
Bread.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.068
1.81 seconds, baby.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.331
Go, go, go!

05:43.734 --> 05:46.258
These ideas are the worst!

05:46.302 --> 05:48.304
We still have time
to come up with something,

05:48.348 --> 05:49.890
but we're gonna have
to pull an all-nighter.

05:49.914 --> 05:52.961
Oh, I don't know
if my body can handle it.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.877
Don't be ridiculous, George.
You've got a super body.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.315
Thanks, Marv.
Wait. That's it.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.449
Super body. Come on, Marv,
we gotta get back to work.

06:05.190 --> 06:09.586
Everyone knows Superman is
the most powerful superhero
of all time, right?

06:09.630 --> 06:12.546
Yeah, he's
practically indestructible.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.505
And we all know
his body has incredible powers.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.768
Yeah, the man is bullet-proof.

06:17.812 --> 06:21.555
But no one ever talks about
what's inside his body.

06:21.598 --> 06:24.601
<i>What if, inside
the greatest superhero</i>

06:24.645 --> 06:27.212
<i>lived the greatest team
of superheroes?</i>

06:45.753 --> 06:48.146
Organs, status report.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.192
Cylungs are steady, Starheart.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.237
Adrenaraven gland on standby.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.674
Oh, yeah!

06:53.717 --> 06:57.852
Bladder Boy nearly full.

06:57.895 --> 07:01.159
Robin the Appendix
is functioning... I think.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.423
Even as a super organ,
Robin has no powers.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.001
Incoming!

07:21.789 --> 07:23.181
Minimal damage sustained.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.140
That's super skin, yo.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.663
Super Organs, activate.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.365
Initiating acceleration
of the heart rate.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.470
Increasing oxygen intake.
Breathe, baby, breathe!

07:59.957 --> 08:02.177
Right in the appendix.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.484
Bladder level's
at full capacity.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.268
We needs a potty break, yo.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.400
Potty break?
We can't take a potty break.

08:08.444 --> 08:09.552
We're in the middle of a fight.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.881
You're gonna have to hold it.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.667
Holding. Holding.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.456
We cannot take
much more of this.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.240
We need
the extra rush of energy.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.547
Got it.
Triggering adrenal gland now.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.303
All right!

08:41.346 --> 08:44.567
We love you, Superman.
You're the best.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.791
Superman always gets
all the credit.

08:50.834 --> 08:54.490
I feel not like the heart,
but like the liver
that is chopped.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.275
Maybe he needs to be reminded
who's really in control.

08:57.319 --> 09:00.670
Good idea.
Bladder Boy, you may release.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.542
Releasing the bladder!

09:07.285 --> 09:09.679
We don't
love you anymore, Superman.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.159
You're the worst.

09:17.861 --> 09:20.429
It's over, George.
We've been up all night,

09:20.472 --> 09:23.432
and we still don't have
a fresh, viable take
on the Titans.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.303
Well, let me check
my back pocket.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.783
I always keep something
in there.

09:29.177 --> 09:32.049
- Eh?
- Well, it'll have to do.

09:32.093 --> 09:35.226
These new Teen Titans
will probably only run
for six issues anyway.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.576
Let's go.

09:36.619 --> 09:39.361
Pit Crew Titans?
What were we thinking?

09:42.494 --> 09:44.496
Pit Crew Titans, go, go, go!

09:47.630 --> 09:49.850
- Nope.
- Come on, get out of here.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.373
Get. You're get.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.160
Jeez, Louise!
