WEBVTT

00:02.288 --> 00:04.407
(Relaxing music)

00:34.032 --> 00:36.031
(Dog sniffs)

00:55.820 --> 00:57.819
(Whirring of lift)

01:05.095 --> 01:07.094
(Whimpers)

01:14.131 --> 01:16.130
(Barking echoes)

01:19.288 --> 01:20.347
(Lift pings)

01:20.447 --> 01:22.446
(Footsteps)

01:24.205 --> 01:25.665
(Lift door clunks)

01:25.765 --> 01:27.764
(Dog barks)

01:31.442 --> 01:33.441
(Flies buzzing)

01:53.270 --> 01:55.269
(Imogen)
Mum?

01:59.627 --> 02:01.626
Mum?

02:12.300 --> 02:14.299
Mum!

02:35.968 --> 02:38.007
(Distant bloodcurdling scream)

02:41.045 --> 02:43.204
(Eerie music)

02:47.881 --> 02:49.660
A number of suspicious deaths

02:49.760 --> 02:52.179
have rocked
financial institutions in Jakarta,

02:52.279 --> 02:54.298
- Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi.
- (Phone beeping)

02:54.398 --> 02:57.336
The six victims
all held senior executive positions,

02:57.436 --> 03:01.374
although no connection between
the deaths has yet been reported.

03:01.474 --> 03:04.833
Police from all three countries
are co-operating...

03:12.588 --> 03:14.827
(Distant sirens wail)

03:16.187 --> 03:18.425
You look stressed, Asif.

03:20.704 --> 03:24.062
Where have you been?
There's a data leak.

03:25.262 --> 03:28.080
It must be Sean Wallace.

03:28.180 --> 03:30.179
Why is he still alive?

03:32.098 --> 03:34.257
(Car door opens)

03:49.049 --> 03:54.147
Working for the Investors
was not good for anybody.

03:54.247 --> 03:58.844
So Sean and I
have made other plans.

04:01.163 --> 04:03.821
London belongs to us now.

04:03.921 --> 04:06.280
But we're offering you
a piece of it.

04:08.959 --> 04:13.556
We're offering you free rein
to provide all product to London.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.493
In return, we want access
to your network and infrastructure.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.471
We all walk away from this
very rich men.

04:26.310 --> 04:28.289
(Asif)
Maybe so,

04:28.389 --> 04:32.247
but I will not work with the man
who helped kill my son.

04:32.347 --> 04:34.345
Either you deal with us...

04:35.145 --> 04:37.144
or you don't deal in London at all.

04:39.823 --> 04:42.341
You have until tonight
to think about it.

04:46.299 --> 04:48.298
(Car door opens)

04:58.653 --> 05:04.130
Perhaps I can offer you
a sweetener?

05:05.889 --> 05:09.927
(Man sings in Kurdish)

05:21.521 --> 05:23.759
He looks more and more like you.

05:26.198 --> 05:30.416
People are asking questions, Lale.
Koba can't be trusted.

05:30.516 --> 05:32.675
They fear we'll be left behind.

05:33.474 --> 05:37.992
The opposite.
Sean negotiated well for us.

05:39.111 --> 05:41.550
Sole distributors of heroin.

05:42.270 --> 05:44.269
(Party horn toots)

05:54.543 --> 05:57.282
I was never given
the chance to play.

05:57.382 --> 05:59.980
Only the chance to fire a gun.

06:01.460 --> 06:05.218
This is why we do it.
So that they don't have to.

06:06.817 --> 06:09.655
Then look at what
you've given them.

06:12.814 --> 06:16.172
Celebrate, you deserve to.

06:16.732 --> 06:19.130
(Quiet suspenseful music)

06:26.487 --> 06:28.485
(Music builds)

06:39.840 --> 06:42.918
Come on.
Come play with me.

06:43.598 --> 06:45.596
Come on! Come on.

06:47.076 --> 06:49.075
(Party horn toots)

06:50.154 --> 06:53.892
OK... I'm coming!

06:53.992 --> 06:58.550
One... two... three...

07:00.629 --> 07:02.628
(Party horn toots)

07:06.466 --> 07:08.464
(Horn toots)

07:21.897 --> 07:23.896
(Horn toots)

07:37.809 --> 07:40.288
- (Lale laughs)
- They found you!

07:41.167 --> 07:43.326
(Sudden burst of eerie music)

07:47.404 --> 07:49.443
(Quiet dramatic music)

08:17.028 --> 08:19.427
He will walk all over you, Sean.

08:28.302 --> 08:30.301
(Music fades)

08:32.100 --> 08:36.618
Asif has agreed,
but with some additional terms.

08:37.698 --> 08:39.697
What additional terms?

08:41.096 --> 08:43.095
Lale.

08:43.415 --> 08:45.393
What are you talking about?

08:45.493 --> 08:46.953
He gets Lale.

08:47.053 --> 08:50.191
We get his infrastructure

08:50.291 --> 08:52.810
and everything that comes with it.

08:53.889 --> 08:57.067
No. I won't agree to it.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.166
He already has her.

09:02.804 --> 09:05.443
You don't realise
what you've done, do you?

09:08.801 --> 09:10.800
(Exhales)

09:12.879 --> 09:16.197
Don't be led by your dick, Sean.

09:18.396 --> 09:20.555
Are you fucking stupid?

09:23.713 --> 09:27.032
(Shouting) This is not about
my fucking dick!

09:36.906 --> 09:38.286
Fuck!

09:38.386 --> 09:40.385
Fuck!

09:43.903 --> 09:45.942
We've got the Kurds on side...

09:47.261 --> 09:49.880
and you're giving up
their fucking leader?

09:49.980 --> 09:53.138
There are more important alliances.

09:54.057 --> 09:56.716
We need Asif on board.

09:56.816 --> 10:00.294
Without his supply,
this city comes to a standstill.

10:02.013 --> 10:04.392
The Investors
might have retreated,

10:04.492 --> 10:08.610
but they'll come back stronger
and we need to be ready.

10:10.249 --> 10:13.127
I made the call
because I knew you wouldn't.

10:18.964 --> 10:20.963
(Koba clears throat)

10:24.401 --> 10:26.400
No retaliations.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.998
So you need to think carefully
about what you do next.

10:35.476 --> 10:37.475
(Door closes)

10:53.986 --> 10:56.345
(Strained breathing)

11:05.980 --> 11:08.218
(Quiet dramatic music)

11:45.959 --> 11:47.958
(Gasps)

11:51.556 --> 11:52.935
(Groans)

11:53.035 --> 11:55.034
(Eerie music)

11:57.672 --> 11:59.671
(Lift pings)

12:02.270 --> 12:04.269
(Footsteps)

13:40.898 --> 13:42.897
Tell me one thing.

13:46.255 --> 13:48.254
Did he know?

13:51.653 --> 13:54.251
Did he know
why you wanted to kill him?

14:02.567 --> 14:04.926
You may not say a word...

14:06.445 --> 14:08.444
but you will feel...

14:09.643 --> 14:13.361
every inch of pain
that you caused Nasir.

14:14.241 --> 14:16.599
(Dramatic music)

14:20.357 --> 14:22.356
I'm not afraid of death.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.674
That's because
you have no one to live for.

14:29.513 --> 14:31.991
Who will grieve for you, Lale?

15:04.574 --> 15:06.573
(Lale groans)

15:07.733 --> 15:11.171
I'm going to cut you
fucking downward.

15:17.048 --> 15:19.047
(Breathes rapidly)

15:25.483 --> 15:27.482
(Lift pings)

15:45.912 --> 15:47.911
(Engine revs)

15:51.150 --> 15:53.229
(Phone dials out)

15:57.665 --> 16:01.544
There have been further deaths
in the world of private banking...

16:02.264 --> 16:04.543
(Shannon)
Yeah, okay. I've got to go.

16:08.579 --> 16:10.579
- Hey.
- (Groans quietly)

16:11.359 --> 16:13.797
Careful, careful, careful.

16:15.717 --> 16:17.955
Here. Have some water.

16:21.474 --> 16:24.191
Shannon, we have to leave London.
It's not safe.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.830
We're not going anywhere, Dad.

16:35.266 --> 16:37.984
(TV on in the background)

17:06.890 --> 17:08.969
Shannon told me everything.

17:11.527 --> 17:13.726
We do not want your help, Marian.

17:17.884 --> 17:19.883
I need yours.

17:23.280 --> 17:27.759
Sean and Koba
have taken London together.

17:29.238 --> 17:30.737
And if they're not stopped,

17:30.837 --> 17:33.395
everything we've worked for
will be destroyed.

17:39.353 --> 17:40.972
No.

17:41.072 --> 17:43.171
Dad, Sean and Koba together
means we're all fucked

17:43.270 --> 17:45.270
- and you're dead.
- Leave us.

17:51.186 --> 17:53.184
(Shannon)
Danny, come.

18:02.141 --> 18:04.140
What do you want, Marian?

18:05.779 --> 18:07.778
Us.

18:08.577 --> 18:10.037
Wallace.

18:10.136 --> 18:12.135
Dumani.

18:13.335 --> 18:17.033
You understand
what it took to build this city,

18:17.133 --> 18:19.132
and you know the pain of losing it.

18:21.171 --> 18:23.170
We can have it back, Ed.

18:30.885 --> 18:35.023
I will not fight for a London
where Sean comes out on top.

18:35.123 --> 18:36.862
Sean won't be at the top.

18:36.962 --> 18:39.020
(Quiet dramatic music)

18:39.121 --> 18:41.120
We will.

18:45.198 --> 18:48.536
London belongs to us.

18:48.635 --> 18:50.875
(Dramatic music builds)

18:56.991 --> 18:58.991
(Music stops)

19:02.029 --> 19:04.028
(Thunder rumbles)

19:10.265 --> 19:12.264
(Knock at door)

19:31.374 --> 19:33.373
They know she's missing.

19:36.571 --> 19:38.770
What am I supposed to do, Billy?

19:39.689 --> 19:41.688
You do nothing.

19:43.288 --> 19:45.866
I'm sorry I can't tell
you what you want to hear,

19:45.966 --> 19:47.944
but a deal
was the right thing to do,

19:48.045 --> 19:50.284
- so don't throw it all away.
- (Scoffs)

19:51.123 --> 19:54.162
And don't look at me
like I don't understand.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.000
I know it's fucked up.
I do.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.758
But that's our fucking world, man.

20:02.677 --> 20:04.177
So, what?

20:04.277 --> 20:06.934
If it was you,
you'd just forget about her?

20:07.035 --> 20:08.933
Is that what you're saying?

20:09.034 --> 20:11.033
What's the alternative?

20:12.192 --> 20:14.750
What happens to you
if you go against Koba?

20:16.309 --> 20:18.308
I don't answer to Koba.

20:19.708 --> 20:22.187
Sean. Don't, man.

20:22.787 --> 20:24.786
Don't.

20:33.581 --> 20:35.580
(Strained breathing)

20:38.098 --> 20:40.278
(Lift pings)

20:40.377 --> 20:42.375
(Suspenseful music)

20:44.934 --> 20:46.933
(Footsteps)

20:57.928 --> 20:59.927
(Asif) So...

22:05.053 --> 22:07.092
- (Lift pings)
- (Lale gasps)

22:18.125 --> 22:20.245
(Door opens and closes)

22:21.085 --> 22:23.763
(Shannon) Are you going to save
a slice for Grandad, yeah?

22:24.763 --> 22:26.802
(Door opens)

22:27.681 --> 22:29.380
Go to bed, Dan.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.479
Bed!

22:40.794 --> 22:42.773
(Scoffs)

22:42.873 --> 22:44.872
I almost got out.

22:46.831 --> 22:48.830
Yeah, I was...

22:50.109 --> 22:52.107
this close.

22:53.107 --> 22:57.904
But you... you... you just
kept dragging me back in.

22:59.664 --> 23:01.563
What the hell you talking about?

23:01.663 --> 23:03.662
They killed him.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.940
The Investors killed my dad!

23:08.620 --> 23:10.619
They killed him.

23:11.818 --> 23:13.817
(Cries)

23:14.816 --> 23:17.095
They killed my dad.

23:18.135 --> 23:21.873
They took my dad
while I was saving yours.

23:21.972 --> 23:23.972
(Sobs)

23:25.931 --> 23:29.209
(Sobbing) Oh my God!

23:29.847 --> 23:33.746
- Elliot! Elliot! Elliot!
- No, don't touch me.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.265
- Don't touch me, please.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

23:36.365 --> 23:38.344
Don't.

23:38.443 --> 23:40.443
Don't.

23:41.083 --> 23:43.280
(Sobbing) Don't, please.

23:49.038 --> 23:53.196
They killed my dad.
They killed my dad.

23:56.194 --> 23:58.293
(Wailing)

23:58.393 --> 24:01.372
I... I... I... have nothing left.

24:01.472 --> 24:03.951
I have nothing left.

24:07.588 --> 24:09.587
I tried, Shannon.

24:10.427 --> 24:12.986
I tried so fucking hard...

24:14.025 --> 24:16.124
to do the right thing.

24:16.223 --> 24:18.923
It always ends up
the same fucking way.

24:19.023 --> 24:22.260
- It's not your fault.
- It is, Shannon. It really is.

24:25.899 --> 24:30.577
I had... information
about the Investors...

24:32.096 --> 24:34.414
and they killed him to get it.

24:36.373 --> 24:38.192
And I don't know what to do.

24:38.292 --> 24:40.231
I don't know where to go. I just...

24:40.331 --> 24:42.970
I just want to fucking end them. I...

24:44.328 --> 24:46.327
Haven't you heard?

24:47.607 --> 24:49.606
It's all happening.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.644
Koba and Sean fucked them over.

24:55.364 --> 24:57.302
What?

24:57.402 --> 24:59.401
How?

25:00.081 --> 25:02.360
He got some sort of information.

25:10.795 --> 25:12.794
Sean?

25:13.193 --> 25:14.333
Elliot...

25:14.433 --> 25:16.251
Sean did this?

25:16.352 --> 25:18.571
Elliot. Elliot.

25:18.671 --> 25:21.569
- I'm gonna kill them both.
- Elliot, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

25:21.670 --> 25:23.489
You can't. Elliot! Elliot!

25:23.588 --> 25:26.047
You can't.
If you do this now, you're dead.

25:26.146 --> 25:28.326
There is no one left who cares.

25:28.426 --> 25:30.444
Don't... Don't fucking say that.

25:30.545 --> 25:34.263
Don't fucking say that! Listen to...
Listen to me. Listen to me.

25:34.863 --> 25:36.862
Listen to me.

25:40.220 --> 25:45.337
I need Sean and Koba dead
just as much as you do.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.575
And I can get us information.

25:52.653 --> 25:54.772
I've been working with Marian, Elliot.

25:56.092 --> 25:58.490
- No!
- So if you want to kill them...

26:01.049 --> 26:03.048
let me help you do it.

26:13.202 --> 26:15.260
(Lale)
If you want what you claim,

26:15.361 --> 26:17.380
you must be prepared
to do everything,

26:17.480 --> 26:19.999
without fear, without care.

26:22.638 --> 26:24.677
This is what it asks of you.

26:32.232 --> 26:34.391
(Lale groans softly)

26:43.547 --> 26:45.665
(Gasps)

27:04.375 --> 27:06.495
(Groans with effort)

27:18.367 --> 27:20.366
(Gasps)

27:21.487 --> 27:23.686
(Groans)

27:33.040 --> 27:35.039
(Breathes heavily)

28:14.098 --> 28:16.097

what happened, yeah?

29:30.259 --> 29:32.258
Nasir begged.

29:35.655 --> 29:37.735
He was a coward, your son.

(Laughs)

29:49.409 --> 29:51.408
Wept...

29:51.968 --> 29:54.806
before I so easily took his life.

Oh, I sliced him from ear to ear.

Enough!

- (Knife thuds)

because he knew you were
the reason he was about to die.

30:41.542 --> 30:43.660
And you know what he said to me?

30:44.860 --> 30:47.978
He said he despised
everything you stood for.

30:48.978 --> 30:50.977
He was ashamed to be your son.

Perhaps it was good
I cut out that dirty tongue of his.
