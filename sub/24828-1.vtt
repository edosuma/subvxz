04:44.641 --> 04:47.812
<i>Please stand on
the right of the escalator.</i>

04:49.947 --> 04:52.983
<i>Please remember
to touch in and touch out.</i>

04:58.689 --> 05:00.925
<i>Ground floor.</i>

05:02.024 --> 05:03.827
<i>Lift going up.</i>

05:08.499 --> 05:09.901
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:50.874 --> 05:54.846
Spoke to the landlord. We both
need to be out first thing Monday.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.849
The van's coming tomorrow
at 6:00 p.m.

06:01.184 --> 06:03.487
May as well
just get on with it.

06:34.817 --> 06:37.185
Blur?

06:37.187 --> 06:38.986
Which album?

06:38.988 --> 06:40.657
<i>The Best Of.</i>

06:45.194 --> 06:46.897
It's mine.

07:16.927 --> 07:18.829
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

07:20.297 --> 07:22.831
Did you say
something?

07:22.833 --> 07:24.168
No.

07:25.334 --> 07:28.036
I just... I--
I wouldn't buy that one.

07:28.038 --> 07:30.904
- Excuse me?
- I wouldn't buy <i>The Best Of.</i>

07:30.906 --> 07:32.075
It's cheating.

07:34.076 --> 07:36.377
Best ofs are like
a shortcut to enlightenment.

07:36.379 --> 07:37.812
If you want to get
into Blur properly,

07:37.814 --> 07:41.683
then you need to appreciate the musical
odyssey that they went through.

07:41.685 --> 07:43.418
Look, this is
just a hodgepodge.

07:43.420 --> 07:46.657
The songs aren't even in order of release.
It's a complete mess.

07:48.324 --> 07:51.962
You should do it properly. Work
your way through the oeuvre.

07:53.663 --> 07:56.964
See, most people make the mistake
of starting with <i>Parklife,</i>

07:56.966 --> 08:00.300
but there was
two other albums before.

08:00.302 --> 08:02.070
People just lump Blur in
with Oasis

08:02.072 --> 08:05.339
and assume <i>Parklife</i> was some kind of
overnight sensation, like <i>Definitely Maybe.</i>

08:05.341 --> 08:07.375
They don't appreciate
their roots,

08:07.377 --> 08:10.211
how their sound evolved
over many years.

08:10.213 --> 08:13.214
Your best bet is to go back
to square one with <i>Leisure</i>

08:13.216 --> 08:15.283
and move through
to <i>Modern Life is Rubbish.</i>

08:15.285 --> 08:18.752
Then you'll have earned <i>Parklife,</i>
before you move on to...

08:18.754 --> 08:21.288
- Sorry. Do you work here?
- No.

08:21.290 --> 08:23.824
So anyway, yeah, I mean,
I'd start with <i>Leisure.</i>

08:23.826 --> 08:28.031
And I'd try and get it on vinyl.
It's a much richer sound.

08:30.199 --> 08:32.102
I'm... I'm just trying to help.

08:35.337 --> 08:37.905
Thanks for the advice,

08:37.908 --> 08:41.842
but I already have the entire
Blur canon on CD and vinyl.

08:41.845 --> 08:44.682
My cousin used to be
one of their roadies.

08:45.981 --> 08:48.983
Well, then why are you
bothering with that?

08:48.985 --> 08:51.185
Because this is
the two-disc limited edition

08:51.187 --> 08:54.125
with the live recording
of their Wembley concert.

08:56.893 --> 08:58.062
Okay.

08:59.096 --> 09:00.895
Sorry.

09:00.897 --> 09:02.833
Didn't mean to bug you.

09:05.735 --> 09:08.872
I just fucking love Blur!
You know...

09:10.373 --> 09:12.810
Yeah. Me too.

09:14.845 --> 09:18.445
- I've got lectures.
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:18.447 --> 09:20.482
Hi.
I'd like to just get this.

09:20.484 --> 09:23.153
12.99, please.

09:28.225 --> 09:30.094
Okay. Thanks.

09:46.109 --> 09:49.046
Don't bother with that, mate.
Piece of shit.

09:53.149 --> 09:55.949
- Can I take one of these, please?
- Of course you can.

09:55.951 --> 09:58.319

- Yeah.

10:42.298 --> 10:43.699
Well, cool.

10:43.701 --> 10:47.301
You should, you know, let me know
if you guys have a gig or whatever.

10:47.303 --> 10:50.070
- Are you on Myspace?
- No, well, not yet, no.

10:50.072 --> 10:53.541
I mean... I mean, we're still
sort of working on the set list

10:53.543 --> 10:55.576
and harmonizing
the creative energies,

10:55.578 --> 10:57.311
you know, things like that.

10:57.313 --> 11:01.151
I'm not trying to
interrogate you. I'm just interested.

11:02.152 --> 11:04.151
You can ask me a question
if you want.

11:04.153 --> 11:06.253
Oh, what,
are we playing a game now?

11:06.255 --> 11:08.055
Okay, sure.

11:08.057 --> 11:10.491
Ask me a question
and I'll answer.

11:10.493 --> 11:13.127
Um, what's your favorite food?

11:13.129 --> 11:15.162
- Licorice Allsorts.
- Really?

11:15.164 --> 11:18.299
Even the boring, squirrelly,
black, twisty ones?

11:18.301 --> 11:21.636
Especially the boring, black,
squirrelly, twisty ones.

11:21.638 --> 11:23.872
- Who is your biggest hero?
- Jimi Hendrix.

11:23.874 --> 11:25.172
Obviously.

11:25.174 --> 11:27.844
- Uh, least favorite food.
- Baked beans.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.945
Evil texture. Ugh.

11:31.947 --> 11:34.949
Um, most treasured
possession.

11:34.951 --> 11:36.986
My dad's guitar.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.289
Best talent.

11:40.956 --> 11:43.590
That would have to be
my monkey impression.

11:49.566 --> 11:51.366
Oh, God!

11:53.903 --> 11:55.137
What's your biggest dream?

11:55.139 --> 11:58.439
Going to Tower Records and seeing
an album cover I designed.

11:58.441 --> 12:00.241
Yeah.

12:00.243 --> 12:02.446
- Favorite moment of the year thus far?
- Right now.

12:04.147 --> 12:07.114
Well, I mean, probably when I got
really mashed on some peyote

12:07.116 --> 12:09.684
and listened to <i>Abbey Road</i>
for six hours on repeat.

12:09.686 --> 12:12.355
I mean, that was fucking epic.
Yeah.

12:17.961 --> 12:19.462
What does that say?

12:27.537 --> 12:29.139
I love this track!

14:05.634 --> 14:07.170
Oh, yeah. Right.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.637
Okay. Got it.

14:10.639 --> 14:12.573
Have you done this
before?

14:12.575 --> 14:13.741
Yeah, yeah.

14:13.743 --> 14:14.776
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:14.778 --> 14:16.245
Okay.

14:18.181 --> 14:20.451
Okay, just a bit...
a bit higher.

14:21.784 --> 14:24.118
A bit high...
No! A bit lower now.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.685
No! Not there!
Not there.

14:25.687 --> 14:28.723
Nearly.
Just a bit too...

14:28.725 --> 14:30.491
And now push.

14:32.528 --> 14:34.295
Okay. Okay.

14:38.467 --> 14:41.435
Fuck off, or I'll come over!

14:41.437 --> 14:43.470
Wait. Um...

14:43.472 --> 14:46.541
Could we put the radio on or something?
The walls are paper thin.

14:46.543 --> 14:48.508
Yeah. Okay.

14:48.510 --> 14:49.579
Okay.

14:57.386 --> 14:58.786
Here.
I'll try something else.

15:10.567 --> 15:13.300
Let's, um...

15:13.302 --> 15:16.369

- Yeah. Okay.

15:16.371 --> 15:18.473
Sure.

15:18.475 --> 15:21.175
Just wiggle this way

So how was your thing
last night?

16:45.794 --> 16:47.795
It's gone really well,
actually.

16:47.797 --> 16:50.897
Working something out with a promoter.
Putting a massive gig together.

16:50.899 --> 16:54.337
- It's all looking pretty fucking fonzie.
- Okay. I was just asking.

16:56.773 --> 16:59.574
We don't have to drag it out like this.
You know?

16:59.576 --> 17:02.776
I mean, I could just
copy these for you.

17:02.778 --> 17:05.749
Or you could upload them if you
just got yourself an iPhone.

17:07.317 --> 17:10.284
I refuse to join the ranks

17:10.286 --> 17:12.586
of the Sudoku-playing,
Kindle-reading,

17:12.588 --> 17:16.257
latte-slurping, iPhone-wearing
clones that adorn this city,

17:16.259 --> 17:19.426
oblivious to the fact that their
individuality has been co-opted

17:19.429 --> 17:21.628
by a handful
of global multinationals!

17:21.631 --> 17:22.963
Fuck the iPhone!

17:22.964 --> 17:24.700
Okay.

17:27.868 --> 17:31.404
You still sticking with the same name?
For the EP?

17:31.406 --> 17:33.807
- Yeah.
- Hip Operation?

17:33.809 --> 17:35.575
Yes.
It's clever.

17:35.577 --> 17:37.577
It works on
two different levels.

17:37.579 --> 17:39.846
But you wouldn't get that,
would you?

17:39.848 --> 17:41.982
Fine.

17:41.984 --> 17:45.486
I know you won't listen to me. You never
listened to me about the name of the band.

17:45.488 --> 17:46.953
What's wrong with
the name of the band?

17:46.955 --> 17:49.590
Head Cleaner?

17:49.592 --> 17:50.892
Yeah.

17:50.894 --> 17:54.428
You used to get those cassettes
that clean fluff off tape decks.

17:54.430 --> 17:55.930
It's like a reference to musical history.
It's retro.

17:55.932 --> 17:59.633
And everybody knows having "head" in the
name of a band is like a lucky charm.

17:59.635 --> 18:02.003
- Plus it sounds cool.
- And it works on two different levels.

18:02.005 --> 18:03.603
Correctamundo.

18:03.605 --> 18:05.840
Yeah. All right, fine.
Yeah, I can dig it.

18:05.842 --> 18:08.742
- So what about the, uh... the dynamic?
- Well, that's obvious.

18:08.744 --> 18:10.745
You on bass, Gus on drums.

18:10.747 --> 18:13.346
I'm the front man.
Lead guitar and vocals.

18:13.348 --> 18:15.850
- Hang on. Why do you get to be the front man?
- Because I'm lead guitar.

18:15.852 --> 18:18.451
- Exactly.
- What do you mean, exactly? Exactly what?

18:18.453 --> 18:21.655
It'll cloud your focus.
Maybe I should be the front man.

18:21.657 --> 18:24.458
Then it'll cloud <i>your</i> focus.
Besides, you're just a bass player.

18:24.460 --> 18:27.527
If you wanted to be front man, you should
have learned a different instrument.

18:27.529 --> 18:29.430
- Bass players can't be the front man.
- Oh, right.

18:29.432 --> 18:31.798
I guess you haven't heard of an obscure
little band called the Police?

18:31.800 --> 18:34.669
Or some random bloke called
Paul Mc-fucking-Cartney?

18:34.671 --> 18:37.337
I could be the front man. Like Dave Grohl.

18:37.339 --> 18:40.775
Well, if I shoot myself in the mouth with a
shotgun, maybe you'll be given a chance.

18:40.777 --> 18:43.646
But until that day,
I'm the fucking front man.

18:46.082 --> 18:48.615
What's up, boys?

18:48.617 --> 18:50.319
Rehearsal's
not going well?

18:52.055 --> 18:54.423
Just having
some creative differences.

18:55.357 --> 18:56.923
You know how it is,
Len.

19:02.664 --> 19:04.667
I know a geezer
you should meet.

19:05.667 --> 19:08.404
Yeah.

19:09.571 --> 19:12.541
Yeah, he'll put the jam
in your sandwich, all right.

19:13.409 --> 19:14.808
What,
is he a manager?

19:14.810 --> 19:17.847
Yeah, sort of. He's more like
a kind of groove doctor.

19:18.948 --> 19:21.884
You know,
audio alchemist.

19:22.984 --> 19:25.421
Sonic surgeon.

19:27.423 --> 19:30.294
Legend has it he gave
Shaun Ryder his first E.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.630
Helped Johnny Marr crack the
riff for "This Charming Man."

19:35.897 --> 19:38.501
Kept the Gallaghers
from killing each other.

19:39.634 --> 19:40.901
For a bit.

19:40.903 --> 19:42.772
I mean,
if I could find him...

19:43.806 --> 19:46.006
Yeah, you should
definitely talk to him.

19:46.008 --> 19:48.042
Could be tricky
though.

19:48.044 --> 19:52.412
He had to disappear for a while after
that business in the hotel in Amsterdam.

19:52.414 --> 19:53.680
What's his name?

19:53.682 --> 19:55.852
No one knows
his real name.

19:57.119 --> 19:59.120
They just call him
the Curve.

19:59.122 --> 20:01.154
No, no, no, no.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.591
No, he's the real deal,
lads.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.427
I'll put a word out, yeah?

20:06.429 --> 20:08.498
See what I can do.

20:09.464 --> 20:11.667
Stick it to the man, boys.

20:12.634 --> 20:14.934
- Rock and roll!
- Yeah!

20:17.906 --> 20:20.810
I'm just saying,
it's been three days.

20:22.044 --> 20:24.711
I just thought I would have
heard from him. You know?

20:24.713 --> 20:27.951
Men are only good for one thing.
I've told you that.

20:30.118 --> 20:32.585
Maybe it's because
he doesn't have a phone.

20:32.587 --> 20:35.956
What is he, a caveman?
How could he not have a phone?

20:35.958 --> 20:39.727
Something about not wanting to conform?
I don't know.

20:39.729 --> 20:42.499
- He sounds weird to me.
- He is.

20:43.432 --> 20:45.501
But I kind of liked him.

20:46.769 --> 20:50.738
I don't get it.
It was all so perfect.

20:50.740 --> 20:53.039
Maybe that's why he hasn't called.
Commitment-phobe.

20:53.041 --> 20:55.411
Hide. Hide. Hide.

21:03.752 --> 21:04.987
Hi.

21:07.522 --> 21:10.857
So, uh, what kind of
desert island?

21:10.859 --> 21:12.428
- What?
- Well...

21:14.063 --> 21:15.662
is it big?

21:15.664 --> 21:17.163
Is it small?
What's the climate like?

21:17.165 --> 21:19.533
Is there any wild animals
running around?

21:19.535 --> 21:22.135
- It's hypothetical.
- I know.

21:22.137 --> 21:24.037
But it might
affect my choices.

21:24.039 --> 21:27.106
I mean, if there was wild
animals running around,

21:27.108 --> 21:31.711
then I might want some
Metallica to scare 'em off.

21:31.713 --> 21:34.683
Or if push came to shove,
then some Celine Dion.

21:37.185 --> 21:40.520
- There are no wild animals.
- Mm-hmm.

21:40.522 --> 21:42.155
It's a small island.

21:42.157 --> 21:46.562
It's just you, a coconut tree,
and a view of the ocean.

21:48.564 --> 21:51.164
I'd have to take
some Radiohead.

21:51.166 --> 21:53.801
It's just a case
of which album.

21:53.803 --> 21:55.201
Mmm.

21:55.203 --> 21:57.640
Oh, but the Stones,
<i>Let It Bleed.</i>

22:00.843 --> 22:02.776
- I'd have to take Motörhead.
- Motörhead?

22:02.778 --> 22:04.978
- They've only done one good song.
- Yeah.

22:04.980 --> 22:08.282
But it's only the best head-banging
tune in the history of rock.

22:08.284 --> 22:12.686
Okay, so you're gonna take a whole
Motörhead album for one song?

22:12.688 --> 22:14.587
Yes. Motörhead are gods.

22:14.589 --> 22:19.293
Besides, having "head"
in the name of your band

22:19.295 --> 22:22.830
is a surefire way to
create musical genius.

22:22.832 --> 22:24.064
Think about it.

22:24.066 --> 22:26.734
Motörhead. Portishead.

22:26.736 --> 22:28.505
Talking Heads. Radiohead.

22:29.605 --> 22:31.205
It's basically
scientific fact.

22:32.741 --> 22:36.946
Give it a couple years and you'll be
adding Head Cleaner to that hallowed list.

22:38.647 --> 22:40.680
- Head Cleaner?
- Yeah.

22:40.682 --> 22:43.750
It's the name of my band.
What do you think?

22:43.752 --> 22:47.621
Well, yeah, it's...
it's... it's interesting.

22:47.623 --> 22:50.826
It works on two different levels.
Maybe even three.

22:56.865 --> 23:00.633
So, is this
your original stuff?

23:00.635 --> 23:04.270
Looks like a...
Stone Roses cover.

23:04.272 --> 23:06.172
Iconic.

23:06.174 --> 23:07.740
Thank you.

23:07.742 --> 23:10.744
I'd have that as my album
cover any day of the week.

23:10.746 --> 23:12.580
Okay.

23:12.582 --> 23:14.784
You have three, two to go.

23:19.055 --> 23:20.853
<i>Electric Ladyland.</i>

23:20.855 --> 23:23.324
You're just a closet populist,
aren't you?

23:23.326 --> 23:26.160
If you're gonna say that...
Hold on.

23:26.162 --> 23:27.697
- Okay.
- Shit.

23:34.737 --> 23:36.670
Just listen to this.

23:46.281 --> 23:49.919
Wow.

23:52.253 --> 23:53.923
Oh, I got goose bumps.

24:11.374 --> 24:13.710
Your theory is bollocks,
by the way.

24:16.112 --> 24:17.411
What theory?

24:17.413 --> 24:19.982
About bands with "head"
in the name.

24:22.351 --> 24:25.119
What about the Lemonheads?
They were crap.

24:25.121 --> 24:28.191
No theory is infallible. That's
why they're called theories.

24:31.394 --> 24:33.059
The Lemonheads
were all right.

24:33.061 --> 24:34.163
Oh! Shit!

24:44.105 --> 24:46.875
Whoa, Liam.
Don't strain yourself, okay?

24:48.376 --> 24:51.111
Look at this crap.

24:51.113 --> 24:54.651
You're such a hoarder. This
is a total waste of space.

24:55.317 --> 24:57.653
It's not a waste of space.

24:58.921 --> 25:01.455
I'm sorry, but some of us
can't just put our entire lives

25:01.457 --> 25:03.760
on a fucking USB stick.

25:53.776 --> 25:56.680
<i>♪ You wanna come back to me ♪</i>

26:07.256 --> 26:10.023
Look, there's something
I want to tell you.

26:15.096 --> 26:16.732
Whoo!

26:20.169 --> 26:22.105
- I love you.
- What?

26:23.239 --> 26:25.171
I said I love you.

26:25.173 --> 26:28.644
I love this one too. This is one
of my favorites! Whoo! Whoo!

26:38.386 --> 26:40.123
I fucking love you!

26:41.957 --> 26:44.761
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

26:49.230 --> 26:50.866
I love you too, Liam.

27:09.050 --> 27:12.121
Listen.
I'm tired.

27:13.388 --> 27:15.023
It's getting late.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.129
I don't want to argue.

27:20.496 --> 27:22.365
We'll do
the rest of this tomorrow.

28:34.336 --> 28:37.504
If you're so adamant on being the
front man, I reckon I need a gimmick.

28:37.506 --> 28:40.474
- No.
- Look, I'm not just gonna fade into the background.

28:40.476 --> 28:43.142
So I need something. A hook.
Something to distinguish me.

28:43.144 --> 28:45.112
What are you
on about?

28:45.114 --> 28:47.247
Like the way Wes Borland
is covered in paint,

28:47.249 --> 28:50.217
or Adam Clayton wears
those funny glasses.

28:50.219 --> 28:52.855
What do you think
about me wearing a top hat?

28:56.392 --> 28:58.357
Brilliant.

28:58.359 --> 29:00.626
Fucking brilliant.

29:00.628 --> 29:05.868
All you've got to do now is sit back
and wait for the Grammys to roll in.

29:11.573 --> 29:13.343
Who the fuck
was that?

29:16.077 --> 29:18.478
Don't misuse my minutes,
Len.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.413
Oi, wait, wait, wait.

29:20.415 --> 29:22.415
Wh-What happened,
man?

29:22.417 --> 29:24.887
Lenny,
who is this guy?

29:28.958 --> 29:30.324
I'm the guy

29:30.326 --> 29:34.460
who expanded the minds of some of
the greatest musicians in history.

29:34.462 --> 29:37.430
I've opened hitherto
unexplored artistic avenues

29:37.432 --> 29:40.302
for everyone from Depeche
Mode to Arcade Fire.

29:41.436 --> 29:44.671
I've shared drugs and women
with the Gallaghers.

29:44.673 --> 29:48.441
We're serious about this band. We'll
listen to anything you got to say.

29:48.443 --> 29:50.643
Your rehearsal was supposed
to start an hour ago,

29:50.645 --> 29:53.680
and all you've done is drone
on about fucking hats!

29:53.682 --> 29:56.083
- I work with real musicians.
- Wait.

29:56.085 --> 29:59.385
Please. Just get one beer
and check out our stuff.

29:59.387 --> 30:02.291
Have a little listen, Curve.
Have a taste.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.525
You'll like it.

30:05.527 --> 30:07.326
For you, Len.

30:07.328 --> 30:09.763
Well, go on then.

30:09.765 --> 30:11.631
Sorry.

30:15.537 --> 30:18.074
<i>♪ Give it to you
Like that ♪</i>

30:29.518 --> 30:32.355
Well, all things considered,

30:33.622 --> 30:35.188
it's not total shite.

30:35.190 --> 30:39.058
- Does that mean you'll help us?
- I've got a lot of bands on my roster right now.

30:39.060 --> 30:41.094
But we need somebody
objective.

30:41.096 --> 30:43.296
A Malcolm McLaren
or Brian Epstein.

30:43.298 --> 30:45.097
- Our P. Diddy.
- Isn't it Puffy again?

30:45.099 --> 30:47.100
- No, it's still Diddy.
- No, I'm sure it's Puff Daddy.

30:47.102 --> 30:49.572
- It's Diddy, you dick.
- Will you shut the fuck up?

30:51.440 --> 30:54.040
Look, I can't
turn shit into gold.

30:54.042 --> 30:56.242
I'm not a miracle worker.

30:56.244 --> 30:58.245
You lot would have to do
all the hard work.

30:58.247 --> 31:01.614
All I can do is tweak a few titties.
You get me?

31:01.616 --> 31:03.452
So, does that mean
you're in?

31:04.185 --> 31:05.218
I'll think about it.

31:05.220 --> 31:06.519
Curve, before you go,

31:06.521 --> 31:09.358
what actually happened
in that hotel in Amsterdam?

31:10.325 --> 31:13.125
If you enjoy
the use of your lungs,

31:13.127 --> 31:15.597
don't ever fucking ask me
about the Dam again.

31:21.135 --> 31:23.370
How much, mate?

31:23.372 --> 31:25.008
Five pound.

31:44.192 --> 31:46.492
I'm so surprised.
They're quite good.

31:46.494 --> 31:48.527
They <i>are</i> good.
They're really good.

32:08.584 --> 32:12.422
I've seen someone I like.
So I'll see you later, okay?

32:14.490 --> 32:15.855
Okay.

32:15.857 --> 32:18.094
Told you he wouldn't come.

32:22.196 --> 32:24.266
Brought you a cold one.

32:25.767 --> 32:27.734
What's wrong?

32:27.736 --> 32:30.636
I don't know what's happened to the Curve.
No one could get hold of him.

32:30.638 --> 32:32.738
He's supposed to be putting
the jam in our sandwich.

32:32.740 --> 32:35.342
Don't worry.
It's going well.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.113
They're not feeling it.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.246
I've got a present for you.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.849
I wasn't gonna give it to you now,
but maybe it'll be a lucky charm.

32:42.851 --> 32:44.487
Hmm.

32:45.753 --> 32:47.155
Thanks, babe.

32:53.461 --> 32:56.863
If you send one more text
during this gig,

32:56.865 --> 32:59.833
I'll ram this phone down your throat,
pull it out your fucking ass,

32:59.835 --> 33:02.138
and text a picture
to your mum.

33:05.773 --> 33:07.707
Hello, lads.
Did you miss me?

33:07.709 --> 33:11.247
Hello, you sluts. Are you
ready for some rock and roll?

33:11.813 --> 33:13.779
- Whoo!
- Have I died?

33:13.781 --> 33:16.583
I can't hear you. I said, are you
ready for some rock and roll?

33:18.252 --> 33:20.554
Good. Because this
is Head Cleaner.

33:20.556 --> 33:24.324
Come on! Make some fucking noise!

33:24.326 --> 33:28.394
Turn the bass down to five,
turn the vocals up to nine.

33:28.396 --> 33:31.398
Right, lads.
This is your stage. Own it.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.533

on the snare no more.

This is perfect.

38:13.547 --> 38:14.983
A perfect day.

38:16.684 --> 38:18.920
We just needed to
feed the animals in the zoo.

38:20.755 --> 38:22.958
And drink sangria
in the park.

38:24.659 --> 38:26.695
And be addicted to heroin.

38:46.648 --> 38:49.050
We're on wafer-thin ice
with this place.

38:50.885 --> 38:53.753
Rent's due on the tenth and the gas
and electricity is due the week...

38:53.755 --> 38:56.054
Due the week after.
I know.

38:56.056 --> 38:58.157
Look,
we'll figure it out.

38:58.159 --> 39:00.126
If the Curve's A&R guy
comes through,

39:00.128 --> 39:03.862
then we're gonna be laughing all the
way to the Rolls-Royce dealership.

39:03.864 --> 39:07.602
Now, are you helping me
with this pizza or what?

39:08.168 --> 39:09.536
Yep.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.168
What are you doing?

39:43.170 --> 39:46.639
I've just thought of a great lyric.

39:55.650 --> 39:57.586
<i>♪ Dum-dah-dum dum ♪</i>

39:58.652 --> 40:03.655

40:27.315 --> 40:29.615
We should probably
eat that pizza.

40:29.617 --> 40:31.217
Yes, we should.

40:35.255 --> 40:38.090
I almost don't want to touch it.

40:38.092 --> 40:39.858
Almost.

40:43.331 --> 40:45.034
Mmm.

40:46.867 --> 40:48.967
Mmm.

40:48.969 --> 40:51.104
An artist.

40:51.106 --> 40:53.005
A muse.

40:53.007 --> 40:55.240
A culinary wizard.

40:55.242 --> 40:56.976
I'm just being greedy.

40:56.978 --> 40:58.581
Mmm.

40:59.179 --> 41:01.115
Mmm. Best not.

41:02.150 --> 41:03.682
Don't worry
about tomorrow.

41:03.684 --> 41:07.286
Do you know how hard it is to get these
interviews? I don't want to be half-cut.

41:07.288 --> 41:10.856
Relax. They're gonna love you.
It's gonna be fine.

41:12.027 --> 41:14.793
Everything that you do,
my love,

41:14.795 --> 41:16.864
is a work
of fucking art.

41:20.101 --> 41:23.135
Everyone's cutting back.
No labels are hiring.

41:23.137 --> 41:26.072
I mean, these interviews
are a waste of time.

41:26.074 --> 41:30.275
Even the top in-house designers
are having to spec out work.

41:30.277 --> 41:31.980
It's just not happening.

41:33.347 --> 41:37.016
Our rent's coming up and
God love him, he does try,

41:37.018 --> 41:40.753
but he can't seem to hold any of
these jobs for longer than a month.

41:40.755 --> 41:42.854
And one of us has to bring
in some real cash, or...

41:42.856 --> 41:47.293
Well, if you're that hard-up, we're always
looking for good designers at our agency.

41:47.295 --> 41:49.228
Advertising?

41:49.230 --> 41:50.796
Contrary to popular opinion,

41:50.798 --> 41:53.166
the office doesn't actually
smell of sulfur, you know.

41:53.168 --> 41:56.101
Anyway,
it's digital marketing, darling.

41:56.103 --> 41:58.806
I'm sure I can
get you an interview.

41:59.373 --> 42:00.440
I don't know.

42:00.442 --> 42:04.177
Nat, wake up and smell
the economic implosion, okay?

42:04.179 --> 42:07.280
Just think about it. I actually
think you'd quite like it.

42:07.282 --> 42:09.347
- And I think you'd be quite good at it.
- You all right, babe?

42:09.349 --> 42:10.685
Yeah.

42:12.420 --> 42:15.787
- How'd the interview go?
- Just wasn't the right opportunity.

42:15.789 --> 42:17.456
We'll figure it out.

42:17.458 --> 42:20.492
As soon as we're signed, all of our
problems will be over. I promise.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.729
How are we doing
with the logos?

42:22.731 --> 42:25.834
Yeah, uh, just inked out
some options for you.

42:27.302 --> 42:31.336
If you don't like any of them,
then I can just go back and...

42:31.338 --> 42:36.342
No, no, no, no. These are all
well-refrigerated, for real.

42:36.344 --> 42:39.945
But this is the one. Yeah, this is the
one we'll use for the demo cover.

42:39.947 --> 42:42.250
That's a dog's dangly bits,
that is.

42:45.987 --> 42:47.222
So, Natalie,

42:48.155 --> 42:49.824
if you were a brand,

42:50.858 --> 42:52.694
what would you be?

43:32.400 --> 43:34.133
What are you doing home?

43:34.135 --> 43:37.135
Manager
was a jobsworth prick.

43:37.137 --> 43:39.572
Gave me the boot.
It's all good though.

43:39.574 --> 43:42.878
I need to concentrate on the demo,
get these tracks finished, really.

43:45.246 --> 43:47.215
How did your interview go?

43:48.315 --> 43:50.483
They offered me the job.

43:50.485 --> 43:52.921
They did?
That's brilliant!

43:56.523 --> 43:58.858
Are you not happy?

43:58.860 --> 44:00.927
Yeah. Yeah.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.528
Of course I am.

44:02.530 --> 44:05.768
Financial security,
steady paycheck.

44:13.942 --> 44:15.608
What's all this?

44:15.610 --> 44:17.376
I'm reorganizing
our music collection.

44:17.378 --> 44:21.414
Come up with a great new system.
You're gonna love it.

44:21.416 --> 44:22.949
I'll walk you
through it later,

44:22.951 --> 44:25.450
but basically it's separated
by country and genre

44:25.452 --> 44:28.056
and then alphabetized
within the different subcats.

44:55.916 --> 44:58.450
Careful.
Careful.

44:58.452 --> 45:00.952
- I'm being careful. All right?
- Slowly. Slowly.

45:00.954 --> 45:03.357
- Wait! Stop!
- Grab it!

45:09.630 --> 45:12.231
- Leave them.
- What?

45:12.233 --> 45:16.235
It's pointless. I don't even want them.
I just want to go.

45:16.237 --> 45:17.970
Are you crazy?

45:17.972 --> 45:20.005
You can't just leave them.

45:20.007 --> 45:22.307
- It's all on my iTunes anyway.
- That's not the point.

45:22.309 --> 45:27.112
None of this even matters.
I hate CDs anyway.

45:27.114 --> 45:29.248
They're tacky. They get
scratched and they skip.

45:29.250 --> 45:32.987
Only if you don't
take care of them properly.

45:35.556 --> 45:37.425
Let me show you something.
Come on.

45:39.693 --> 45:41.427
- Come on.
- What? No.

45:41.429 --> 45:44.365
- Come on. Come on.
- Liam, I d...

45:46.434 --> 45:49.238
I'm not a baby.
You can let go of my hand.

45:53.407 --> 45:55.009
You see this?

45:57.679 --> 45:59.412
Radiohead. <i>Kid A.</i>

45:59.414 --> 46:04.453
Only a limited number of first-edition
copies had this inside.

46:06.420 --> 46:11.190
This is not the track listing
or the inlay sleeve.

46:11.192 --> 46:13.427
It's a whole different
ball game.

46:15.429 --> 46:20.167
A veritable phantasmagoria of
ideas, poems, phrases, artwork,

46:21.101 --> 46:23.170
and they hid it in there.

46:24.338 --> 46:26.407
You have to break it open
to find it.

46:28.108 --> 46:30.675
See it as whatever you want.

46:30.677 --> 46:33.412
A hidden treasure map to help
people understand the album

46:33.414 --> 46:35.182
on a deeper level,

46:36.384 --> 46:38.483
or an irrelevant gimmick

46:38.485 --> 46:43.125
that will remain unread and unfound
by 99% of the people that bought it.

46:44.759 --> 46:48.094
But the fact remains,

46:48.096 --> 46:50.996
it was put there
for a reason.

46:50.998 --> 46:54.066
And call me old-fashioned,

46:54.068 --> 46:55.668
but I think it's nice,

46:55.670 --> 47:00.072
as a functioning, alive,

47:00.074 --> 47:03.409
flesh-and-blood human being,

47:03.411 --> 47:07.416
to be able to hold something
tangible in your hands,

47:10.717 --> 47:12.453
to appreciate the texture,

47:16.724 --> 47:19.227
to actually have
an interaction with...

47:20.128 --> 47:23.429
with something physical

47:23.431 --> 47:25.032
and real...

47:30.103 --> 47:33.706
before we all download
our brains into cyberspace

47:33.708 --> 47:37.108
and receive a pixilated equation telling
us the formula for a good fucking song,

47:37.110 --> 47:40.311
or drinking
a decaf fucking latte!

47:55.262 --> 47:56.329
Shit.

48:27.527 --> 48:30.429
Well, there's a two-hour queue
for the showers

48:30.431 --> 48:33.465
and a four-hour queue
for the cash point.

48:33.467 --> 48:36.168
Are you sure
there's no more food left?

48:36.170 --> 48:37.769
We've got one tin of beans left.
That's it.

48:39.739 --> 48:42.208
Next year,
when we're headlining,

48:42.210 --> 48:45.179
we'll be backstage gorging on caviar...
lap of luxury.

48:46.179 --> 48:48.179
Beans it is then.

48:48.181 --> 48:49.849
Is that all right?

48:49.851 --> 48:52.117
Yeah, it's fine.

48:52.119 --> 48:54.487
Is it man-fine
or woman-fine?

48:54.489 --> 48:55.887
What?

48:55.889 --> 48:57.889
Oh, you know, like,

48:57.891 --> 49:00.458
man-fine
means it's actually fine.

49:00.460 --> 49:03.162
Like when you're in the pub
and someone says,

49:03.164 --> 49:06.798
"They're all out of Heineken. I got you
a Stella." And you say, "That's fine."

49:06.800 --> 49:08.833
You know,
it means exactly that.

49:08.835 --> 49:11.137
Woman-fine
means I'm saying it's fine,

49:11.139 --> 49:15.141
but there's an implicit sense of guilt,
anger, and thinly-veiled resentment

49:15.143 --> 49:17.175
attached to the statement,

49:17.177 --> 49:20.278
designed specifically to make the
man feel guilty and ashamed.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.313
But there's no way
he could possibly contest it,

49:22.315 --> 49:24.550
because technically you've
already said, "It's fine."

49:24.552 --> 49:27.653
Though the tone of your voice,
you know, suggests

49:27.655 --> 49:30.292
that the subtext is,
"I fucking hate you."

49:34.195 --> 49:35.697
That's woman-fine.

49:40.333 --> 49:41.900
So is it actually fine, or...

49:41.902 --> 49:43.869
No, it's not.

49:43.871 --> 49:45.503
I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of everything.

49:45.505 --> 49:50.342
This place, here, being stuck in a muddy
tent for three days with no food, no money.

49:50.344 --> 49:52.577
I'm... I'm soaking wet.

49:52.579 --> 49:54.445
This is shit!

49:54.447 --> 49:56.382
Why did you
come here then?

49:58.518 --> 50:00.519
Yeah. You're right.

50:00.521 --> 50:02.524
I obviously
shouldn't have bothered.

50:03.891 --> 50:05.925
I've... had enough.

50:05.927 --> 50:07.525
What do you mean?

50:07.527 --> 50:09.528
I've had enough!

50:09.530 --> 50:12.463
If you're gonna be in a band,
then be in a fucking band!

50:12.465 --> 50:15.767
Work, rehearse, hustle, write!

50:15.769 --> 50:18.537
I mean, you bang on about
how great you're gonna be,

50:18.539 --> 50:21.143
and you haven't even
recorded the fucking demo!

50:22.342 --> 50:25.513
I gave up my dream
so that you could live yours.

50:26.646 --> 50:29.615
This whole place,
it just sums you up.

50:29.617 --> 50:34.420
Never Never Land for a bunch of
aimless, perpetually stoned slackers.

50:34.422 --> 50:37.956
I get why you like it,
but I'm not 18 anymore.

50:37.958 --> 50:40.226
I mean, there's more to life
than this.

50:40.228 --> 50:41.496
Like what?

50:42.963 --> 50:44.732
Like getting married.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.436
Buying our own house.

50:49.936 --> 50:51.639
Raising a family.

50:55.476 --> 50:57.275
Where's all this
coming from?

50:57.277 --> 51:01.713
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
You've got no idea, do you?

51:01.715 --> 51:05.353
I'm not a student anymore.
I'm nearly 30. I...

51:11.592 --> 51:12.891
Perfect.

51:12.893 --> 51:15.262
Just perfect.

51:15.929 --> 51:17.662
I bought you the tickets

51:17.664 --> 51:20.331
because I know how much
you wanted to come.

51:20.333 --> 51:23.672
I bought the tickets because you're skint.
Because you're always skint!

51:24.972 --> 51:26.608
But I don't care.

51:27.407 --> 51:29.441
I'd bankroll the both of us

51:29.443 --> 51:32.781
until we're old and wrinkly
and our pensions have run out...

51:34.282 --> 51:36.815
if you just really
tried to make this work.

51:36.817 --> 51:38.284
What? Nat, w...

51:38.286 --> 51:39.788
I'm going home.

51:43.023 --> 51:45.492
- What are you saying?
- I need time to think.

51:46.893 --> 51:48.495
And so do you.

52:58.599 --> 52:59.867
Thank you.

53:25.126 --> 53:26.695
Are you lost?

53:28.896 --> 53:30.162
You all right?

53:34.668 --> 53:37.101
- What's wrong?
- Little fella's lost.

53:38.672 --> 53:40.972
Don't worry, mate.
We'll find your mum.

53:40.974 --> 53:43.508
You mustn't
run off like that!

53:43.510 --> 53:46.845
How many times have I told you?
Come on.

53:46.847 --> 53:50.148
What kind of mother takes her
son to a modern art gallery?

53:50.150 --> 53:52.550
Borderline
child abuse.

53:52.552 --> 53:54.586
What are we
doing here anyway?

53:54.588 --> 53:57.559
I told you. We're doing a viral
campaign for the gallery.

53:58.759 --> 54:01.559
- A wank, if you ask me.
- Shh!

54:01.561 --> 54:03.996
Keep your voice down.
These are clients.

54:03.998 --> 54:07.199
- Liam, my boss is here, okay?
- Well, who cares what they think?

54:07.201 --> 54:09.503
Fucking corporate whores!

54:12.072 --> 54:14.572
- Are you drunk?
- Maybe.

54:14.574 --> 54:17.508
- Are you kidding me right now, Liam?
- No.

54:17.510 --> 54:18.844
Natalie!

54:18.846 --> 54:21.983
Liam. This is, um,
Mr. Jennings, my boss.

54:23.583 --> 54:26.617
From the office party, remember?
And this is Adrian.

54:26.619 --> 54:29.188
Hi. Good to see you, man.
How's the band going?

54:29.190 --> 54:30.755
Is it
the Head Wipers?

54:30.757 --> 54:32.990
It's going
fucking awesome, mate.

54:32.992 --> 54:37.229
Yeah, actually, Liam's not feeling too
great so he might have to head back.

54:37.231 --> 54:39.831
- Sorry to hear that.
- Feel better, man.

54:39.833 --> 54:43.437
Don't do this to me. You're drunk.
You need to go home.

54:46.806 --> 54:48.206
What's that?

54:48.208 --> 54:49.476
What?

54:49.943 --> 54:50.811
That.

54:52.579 --> 54:54.612
I bought an iPod.

54:54.614 --> 54:56.782
Are you serious? I mean,
where's the inlay sleeve?

54:56.784 --> 54:59.150
Where's the track listing?
The artwork? The credits?

54:59.152 --> 55:02.054
I just want to listen
to the music.

55:02.056 --> 55:05.090
You used to want to design album
covers, for crying out loud.

55:05.092 --> 55:07.796
Yeah, well, I guess they'll
just have to be digital now.

55:08.829 --> 55:10.262
Digital.

55:10.264 --> 55:13.565
All of this crap is killing the music
industry. Don't you realize that?

55:13.567 --> 55:15.867
We met in a record store.

55:15.869 --> 55:17.302
That's never
gonna happen again.

55:17.304 --> 55:21.507
If those things had been around ten
years ago, we'd never have even met.

55:21.509 --> 55:22.974
I mean,
where does it end?

55:22.976 --> 55:27.845
Food chains, coffee chains,
iPods, cell phones?

55:27.847 --> 55:31.820
It's all part of the same process
of corporate homogenization.

55:32.987 --> 55:35.586
Yeah, it's just
a hundred quid to you.

55:35.588 --> 55:38.690
But no one's stopping to ask
what the true cost is here,

55:38.692 --> 55:41.260
to the music industry, to the
little man, to the individual,

55:41.262 --> 55:42.793
to the band, to <i>me!</i>

55:42.795 --> 55:44.862
Liam, can you
keep your voice down?

55:44.864 --> 55:47.766
No! I'm sorry, but I can't
let this slide, Nat.

55:47.768 --> 55:49.867
The iPod is a shoplifter
of the soul,

55:49.869 --> 55:52.938
and it's designed specifically
to sap the human spirit.

55:52.940 --> 55:54.273
Look, you sold out!

55:54.275 --> 55:58.646
- Please be quiet.
- Or what? Eh? Or what?

56:00.313 --> 56:02.516
You fucking people.

56:03.717 --> 56:06.851
You don't have any heart,
any soul.

56:06.853 --> 56:08.987
You don't know what it
costs to create something,

56:08.989 --> 56:11.722
to reach inside yourself
and pull your heart out

56:11.724 --> 56:13.862
and get nothing in return!

56:16.063 --> 56:21.503
You people wouldn't know good art
if it hit you in the fucking face!

56:26.574 --> 56:28.576
Get the fuck off!

56:34.681 --> 56:37.014
I can't believe that
you're doing this to me.

56:37.016 --> 56:40.053
Are you crazy? What the
fuck are you playing at?

56:41.054 --> 56:42.556
They passed on our demo.

56:43.324 --> 56:46.057
You think that's an excuse?

56:46.059 --> 56:50.362
It's the last one.
I mean, we're cooked.

56:50.364 --> 56:53.197
Everybody's scaling back
their rosters.

56:53.199 --> 56:56.904
In five years, they're the only
label that's paid any interest.

56:58.271 --> 56:59.940
It's over.

57:01.208 --> 57:04.579
You know, for once,
you're absolutely right, Liam.

57:07.014 --> 57:12.554
It is definitely
100 percent over.

57:55.128 --> 57:56.797
I'm all packed.

57:58.766 --> 58:01.735
So, um...
So I guess this is it.

58:10.677 --> 58:12.179
I'm so sorry.

58:13.681 --> 58:14.949
Me too.

58:20.019 --> 58:21.686
You can have this
if you want.

58:24.925 --> 58:26.160
Really?

58:27.460 --> 58:28.762
Yeah.

58:30.898 --> 58:33.034
It's too experimental
for me anyway.

58:38.739 --> 58:40.173
Thank you.

Don't start, Mum.
I know. I know.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.089
A lovely girl like that.

01:01:44.657 --> 01:01:46.191
Oh, well,
it's no wonder she left,

01:01:46.193 --> 01:01:48.226

01:01:48.228 --> 01:01:51.662

01:01:53.567 --> 01:01:56.300
You can't kip
on my couch forever, Liam.

01:01:56.302 --> 01:01:59.637
- You need to get up off your ass and get yourself a job.
- I know.

01:01:59.639 --> 01:02:02.039

The Digital Partner App allows couples
to send each other digital gifts

01:03:59.559 --> 01:04:04.131
in a... in, um...
in a simulated environment.

01:04:05.297 --> 01:04:07.434
Um, just...

01:04:08.668 --> 01:04:11.168
Like, bouquets of
flowers, and, um,

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:14.238
love poems, box of chocolates,
that sort of thing.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.708
Uh, each partner's profile can
be individually personalized,

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.510
so the digital avatar
on the screen

01:04:18.512 --> 01:04:21.449
actually directly resembles
the actual person.

01:04:22.715 --> 01:04:25.215
The gifts that you can give
will be charged to an account.

01:04:25.217 --> 01:04:26.418
Uh, they'll be affordable.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.119
A pound each or so,
rising steadily.

01:04:29.121 --> 01:04:31.588
And it's a great way
for couples to communicate

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:35.392
and, you know, show that they're
thinking of each other.

01:04:35.394 --> 01:04:39.500
And obviously, there are pop-up
ads, the usual accoutrements.

01:04:45.539 --> 01:04:47.274
Put your shrapnel
away.

01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:48.673
Thanks.

01:04:48.675 --> 01:04:50.809
Sorry, man.
Split's cleaned me out.

01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:54.378
Look, I don't know what I'm gonna
do, but I need to sort my shit out.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.680
I just got a new job,
as it goes.

01:04:56.682 --> 01:04:57.749
They're looking
for more staff.

01:04:57.751 --> 01:04:59.818
I can put in a word with
the manager, if you want.

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.820
That would be great.
Where is it?

01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:07.528
Cappuccino for Tristan?

01:05:09.295 --> 01:05:10.196
Cappuccino
for Tristan.

01:05:11.565 --> 01:05:14.199
I've got a large soy
decaf latte for Adrian.

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:16.603
Large decaf latte
for Adrian.

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:20.373
Liam.

01:05:21.608 --> 01:05:24.842
Oh, geez, sorry, man. I didn't
see you there. How you doing?

01:05:24.844 --> 01:05:27.647
Sorry. How are things
with Head Squeaker?

01:05:31.184 --> 01:05:33.751
Actually, I'm-I'm gonna
give you guys a minute.

01:05:33.753 --> 01:05:36.423
- Um, I'll just be outside.
- Okay.

01:05:42.596 --> 01:05:44.128
You got a job.

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:45.465
It's temporary.

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:47.334
Latte.

01:05:48.869 --> 01:05:51.105
- All right, Nat?
- Hi.

01:05:55.608 --> 01:05:57.610
Right.
Is that mine?

01:06:02.648 --> 01:06:04.250
Large latte,
extra froth.

01:06:05.318 --> 01:06:06.554
Just the way you like it.

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.556
Thanks.

01:06:13.693 --> 01:06:15.563
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:06:18.697 --> 01:06:21.501
Hi. Can I have a skinny
soy latte, please?

01:06:23.637 --> 01:06:26.240
Hey, um...

01:06:27.873 --> 01:06:31.678
Listen, Nat. I don't want to
be in the middle of something.

01:06:34.581 --> 01:06:36.717
I have been
on the other side of this.

01:06:37.684 --> 01:06:40.184
Will you need more time?

01:06:40.186 --> 01:06:41.552
I totally get it.

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:45.391
It's over.

01:06:46.193 --> 01:06:47.628
I promise.

01:06:48.695 --> 01:06:50.664
I need to move forward.

01:06:51.664 --> 01:06:53.134
Okay.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.336
Hello?

01:06:57.369 --> 01:06:58.739
- Excuse me?
- What?

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.409
A skinny soy latte,
please.

01:07:03.342 --> 01:07:05.545
Sorry, mate. Olly.

01:07:07.547 --> 01:07:08.615
Skinny soy latte.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:17.657
Liam! I don't pay you to smoke!

01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:23.663

01:08:11.978 --> 01:08:14.545
I've got one word for you:
Tinder.

01:08:14.547 --> 01:08:16.580
- What's that?
- It's a dating app that links to your Facebook.

01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:18.683
I'm not even on Facebook.
You know that.

01:08:18.685 --> 01:08:21.551
This is what I'm talking about.
Right? This all has to stop.

We are dragging you, kicking and

I'm not right.

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.606

No, I'm Layla.

01:09:33.893 --> 01:09:35.761
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:39.765
Are you
from the States?

01:09:40.432 --> 01:09:41.868
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:09:44.104 --> 01:09:45.236
Studying here, or...

01:09:45.238 --> 01:09:49.906
No, no. I, uh... I work in a
clothes shop on Portobello.

01:09:49.908 --> 01:09:51.975
How about you?
What do you do?

01:09:51.978 --> 01:09:55.582
Wait. Let me guess.
Something artistic, right?

01:09:57.117 --> 01:09:58.449
Oh, I'm in a band.
Yeah.

01:09:58.451 --> 01:10:01.585
I knew it.
You've got that look.

01:10:01.587 --> 01:10:05.725
The whole smoldering, tortured
rocker thing going on.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.529
It's kinda cool.

01:10:14.134 --> 01:10:15.536
Well,
that can't be good.

01:10:16.603 --> 01:10:20.470
Yeah. Seems my date's
flaked on me.

01:10:20.472 --> 01:10:22.639
Women.

01:10:22.641 --> 01:10:24.478
Yeah.

01:10:25.578 --> 01:10:29.446
Well,
here's my friend.

01:10:29.448 --> 01:10:32.983
Why don't I give you
my card, in case...

01:10:32.985 --> 01:10:36.489
you know, in case you ever need
some vintage women's clothing.

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:39.557
- Hey. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Hi. Okay.

01:10:39.559 --> 01:10:41.395
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

01:10:49.636 --> 01:10:53.638
Ooh, I don't
know how he did that.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.776
Honestly, even the
texture of baked beans,

01:10:57.042 --> 01:10:59.643
it makes me wince.

01:10:59.645 --> 01:11:00.911
Mm-hmm.

01:11:04.751 --> 01:11:06.183
So, do you like it here
in London?

01:11:06.185 --> 01:11:11.888
Yeah. Yeah. I wish I had been here in
the '60s. That was my era, you know?

01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:16.994
I should have been working in some
Carnaby Street boutique in 1962.

01:11:16.996 --> 01:11:20.697
Driving an E-type
Jag with a beehive hairdo,

01:11:20.699 --> 01:11:23.067
doing the Twist and freaking
out to the Beatles.

01:11:25.003 --> 01:11:26.603
I know.

01:11:26.605 --> 01:11:28.873
Do you ever feel like you
were born in the wrong time?

01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:31.444
Yeah.
All the time.

01:11:50.195 --> 01:11:51.698
What are you listening to?

01:11:53.065 --> 01:11:54.264
Bombay Bicycle Club.

01:11:54.266 --> 01:11:57.000
Nice. That's nice.

01:11:57.002 --> 01:11:59.135
But check this out.

01:11:59.137 --> 01:12:01.641
I think you'll really
love it.

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.649
- Interesting.
- Yes?

01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:14.020
Can I have this dance?

01:12:17.524 --> 01:12:18.625
Thanks.

Sure. Uh...

01:14:27.953 --> 01:14:31.688
Anything you want? What are
you into at the moment?

01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:34.892
Um, Black Keys,
The xx,

01:14:34.894 --> 01:14:38.228
Frightened Rabbit,
Radiohead, obviously.

01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:43.267
Man, I hate Radiohead. They're
so pretentious and depressing.

01:14:43.269 --> 01:14:45.639
Gotta call a veto
on that shit.

01:14:55.047 --> 01:14:57.380
- One more drink.
- I've got work in the morning.

01:14:57.382 --> 01:15:00.086
So do I.

01:15:02.889 --> 01:15:04.891
Thanks again for dinner.

01:15:09.295 --> 01:15:10.764
Hey.

01:15:12.198 --> 01:15:17.268
I've got good news, boys. My contacts
came through. You've gotten a gig.

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:19.070
- Foals.
- Yeah.

01:15:19.072 --> 01:15:21.171
You're on the bill next month at The Forum.

01:15:21.173 --> 01:15:22.040
Yes!

01:15:22.042 --> 01:15:25.843
This is it, boys!
This is our comeback!

01:15:25.845 --> 01:15:28.778
But we need to be
totally ready, right?

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.848
Facebook, Twitter, SoundCloud,
Groove Shot, the lot.

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:37.021
And we have to be ready, so that if
we get a spark, it all catches fire.

01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:40.127
'Cause all we really need
is one killer track, Liam.

01:15:41.961 --> 01:15:44.794
This is it. This is the lifeline
we've been waiting for.

01:15:44.796 --> 01:15:46.932
So let's make it count!

01:15:49.868 --> 01:15:51.037
Are you up for this?

01:15:53.338 --> 01:15:55.042
I don't know, man.

01:15:57.243 --> 01:15:58.812
Are we kidding
ourselves?

01:16:00.279 --> 01:16:03.781
It feels like this ship's already sailed.
Don't you think?

01:16:03.783 --> 01:16:08.085
No. I don't think. Because this is our
chance. This could be our comeback.

01:16:08.087 --> 01:16:11.755
Comeback kind of implies that you've
got something to come back from.

01:16:11.757 --> 01:16:15.058
You got dumped, and it sucks, and it
hurts, and it's shit, and I'm sorry.

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.294
But we need you on top form
for this gig. Yeah?

01:16:17.296 --> 01:16:20.363
We need a banging new song.
We need a single.

01:16:20.365 --> 01:16:24.104
You're the fucking songwriter. You
wanted to be the front man. Remember?

01:16:25.371 --> 01:16:28.108
- Yeah.
- So, start acting like one.

01:17:29.467 --> 01:17:31.434
The one and only...

01:17:31.436 --> 01:17:32.602
Head Cleaner!

01:17:39.912 --> 01:17:42.515

01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:51.949

01:18:51.951 --> 01:18:53.918
This pistachio
is incredible.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.518
- You have to try this.
- Really? Go on, then.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.287
- You have to.
- That's a lot.

01:19:00.292 --> 01:19:03.393
- Yeah. Wow, that's, um...
- It's so good.

01:19:03.395 --> 01:19:06.664
It's... I mean, it's really excellent gelato.

01:19:06.666 --> 01:19:09.299
And speaking of gelato,
you know,

01:19:09.301 --> 01:19:13.504
there is another place that I
really think we should check out.

01:19:13.506 --> 01:19:16.005
- Oh, yeah? Where?
- Yeah. It's supposed to be fantastic.

01:19:16.007 --> 01:19:21.413
Um, it is about...
992 miles away.

01:19:24.417 --> 01:19:26.019
It's Florence.

01:19:26.551 --> 01:19:29.320
- Florence?
- Yeah.

01:19:29.322 --> 01:19:33.426
I was thinking maybe you and me
could go on a little trip.

01:19:35.594 --> 01:19:39.595
Unless, of course, you don't like incredible
architecture, and beautiful weather,

01:19:39.597 --> 01:19:42.333
and the most spectacular art ever
created in the history of humanity.

01:19:42.335 --> 01:19:44.304
In which case,
we should just forget it.

01:19:47.472 --> 01:19:52.278
I mean, it's up to you.
But, um, just think about it.

01:19:53.311 --> 01:19:55.114
Okay. Okay.

01:20:10.128 --> 01:20:12.196
Olly, I'm gonna do
the liquorice allsorts song.

01:20:12.198 --> 01:20:14.098
Liam, we haven't practiced it.
All right?

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.598
It's going well.
Stick to the set list.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.500
- No.
- It's going well, mate.

01:20:16.502 --> 01:20:18.768
C-D-E. Just follow it
on the bottom line.

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.037
Gus, kick drum halfway through.
All right?

01:20:21.039 --> 01:20:24.273
I'm not playing the song, mate. I don't
know it. Don't fucking start, Gus.

01:20:24.275 --> 01:20:26.479
Liam!
If you feel it, play it!

01:20:33.685 --> 01:20:35.956

All right. I'm sorry.
We're coming back.

01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:13.739
Your song
wasn't that bad, mate.

01:24:18.711 --> 01:24:20.977
You two, fuck off!

01:24:20.979 --> 01:24:23.215
I need a word
with this one.

01:24:25.984 --> 01:24:29.655
I'm sorry, Curve.
I'm so sorry.

01:24:30.855 --> 01:24:32.822
I've let you down.

01:24:32.824 --> 01:24:35.360
All I had left
was you guys.

01:24:37.997 --> 01:24:39.566
Don't worry, mate.

01:24:40.798 --> 01:24:42.801
I haven't come here
to give you a hard time.

01:24:44.903 --> 01:24:50.706
All we can ask of any artist is that they
leave a piece of their soul on the stage.

01:24:50.708 --> 01:24:53.613
Of course, ideally,
they finish the gig first, but...

01:24:55.814 --> 01:24:59.415
Well, I know we didn't get to do
our full set, but we did enough.

01:24:59.417 --> 01:25:01.351
And they liked us, man.

01:25:01.353 --> 01:25:03.719
You fucking killed it
with that song, mate!

01:25:03.721 --> 01:25:07.023
And that is what I've been
trying to tell you.

01:25:07.025 --> 01:25:10.059
The best music
comes out of pain.

01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:13.265
You've gotta sing
from the fucking heart, mate!

01:25:13.899 --> 01:25:15.368
Curve, I'm so sorry.

01:25:21.039 --> 01:25:22.641
My name's
not the Curve, mate.

01:25:23.908 --> 01:25:25.644
And I'm no rock god.

01:25:29.847 --> 01:25:32.417
My real name is Derek.

01:25:34.787 --> 01:25:38.021
I live in Milton Keynes with me dad.
He's a maths teacher.

01:25:38.023 --> 01:25:42.058
Do you know what I do when
I'm not here with you guys?

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:44.561
I'm the assistant manager
at Tesco's.

01:25:44.563 --> 01:25:48.432
Out there, I'm a nobody, but
when I'm in here with you guys,

01:25:48.434 --> 01:25:52.305
when I'm sprinkling me magical
musical fairy dust for you,

01:25:53.838 --> 01:25:55.641
well, then, I'm the Curve.

01:25:56.942 --> 01:25:58.677
And I fucking love it.

01:26:00.011 --> 01:26:01.445
You're the only band
I'm working with

01:26:01.447 --> 01:26:03.412
and you're the only band
I believed in

01:26:03.414 --> 01:26:05.618
and who believed my bullshit.

01:26:06.952 --> 01:26:08.684
I live for this, mate.

01:26:08.686 --> 01:26:10.687
What about all the stuff
in Amsterdam?

01:26:10.689 --> 01:26:12.555
Mate, I've never even
been to Amsterdam.

01:26:12.557 --> 01:26:14.891
I went to Jersey once
with me nan. That's it.

01:26:14.893 --> 01:26:17.697
What about all the stuff
with the Gallaghers?

01:26:20.032 --> 01:26:21.964
You're the only Liam
I know.

01:26:21.966 --> 01:26:24.901
And the only Noel I know works
behind the fish counter in Tesco's.

01:26:24.903 --> 01:26:28.772
You cheeky bastard.

01:26:28.774 --> 01:26:31.444
Yeah.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.879
The thing is, mate,
this is your band.

01:26:36.881 --> 01:26:40.652
You write all the songs. I just did
a bit of titty tweaking for you.

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.452
You're a great songwriter.

01:26:43.454 --> 01:26:45.824
And now you're
a great fucking singer too.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.695
The thing is, man,

01:26:51.596 --> 01:26:54.466
I was so looking forward
to tonight.

01:26:56.068 --> 01:26:57.869
It's all
I've ever wished for.

01:27:00.139 --> 01:27:02.472
But it's like...

01:27:02.474 --> 01:27:04.409
it's like
it meant nothing...

01:27:05.144 --> 01:27:07.547
because she wasn't here
to see it.

01:27:09.715 --> 01:27:12.485
Sometimes you have to lose something
to know how much you needed it.

01:27:15.753 --> 01:27:18.490
You already know what you need to do.
Right?

01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:26.830
Where are you going?

01:27:26.832 --> 01:27:30.503
You're ready.
My work here is done.

01:27:33.771 --> 01:27:34.774
Curve?

01:27:36.574 --> 01:27:39.378

01:30:10.228 --> 01:30:13.698
