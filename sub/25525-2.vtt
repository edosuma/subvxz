32:18.457 --> 32:20.657
Everyone I knew.

32:20.659 --> 32:22.459
Everyone I loved.

32:25.197 --> 32:29.332
Why? Why would they do that?

32:29.334 --> 32:32.235
He wouldn't tell me why.

32:32.237 --> 32:36.206
Only that they were well paid.

32:36.208 --> 32:38.608
Doesn't matter now anyway.

32:38.610 --> 32:41.778
Killing an agent of the Covenant
for whatever reason is death.

32:41.780 --> 32:45.148
Doesn't make it right.

32:45.150 --> 32:48.318
You're Prime Order yourself.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.953
You're part of their regime.

32:49.955 --> 32:53.857
Things aren't always as they appear.

32:53.859 --> 32:56.860
Which is why we may still have a chance.

32:56.862 --> 32:58.661
What are you talking about?

32:58.663 --> 33:00.447
When is Wythers going to do this?

33:00.450 --> 33:01.898
First light.

33:01.900 --> 33:04.013
Good.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.401
Then we still have time.

33:05.403 --> 33:06.936
Garret.

33:10.542 --> 33:12.609
I'm sorry I let you down.

33:17.415 --> 33:19.249
Me, too.

33:25.289 --> 33:28.724
Say good-bye to your lady friend.

33:28.727 --> 33:31.327
- I barely know her.
- Knew her.

33:31.329 --> 33:33.763
You barely knew her.

33:33.765 --> 33:36.466
Yeah. We'll see.

33:49.700 --> 33:52.715
We're doing this now.

33:52.717 --> 33:54.494
You said I had till first light.

33:54.497 --> 33:58.021
I still have time.

33:58.023 --> 34:00.957
Tell it to the gods when you meet them.

34:00.959 --> 34:04.894
I told you any infraction.

34:04.896 --> 34:07.330
I'm a man of my word.

34:07.332 --> 34:10.333
Time to keep my promise.

34:10.335 --> 34:12.810
Actually, you said you'd
throw me to the Plaguelings.

34:12.813 --> 34:15.213
I'll take my chances that
way if you don't mind.

34:15.216 --> 34:17.040
I do, actually.

34:17.042 --> 34:19.509
The punishment for murder is beheading.

34:27.618 --> 34:31.453
Easy. You won't get very far.

34:31.456 --> 34:33.623
Stick her on the block.

34:35.422 --> 34:37.255
Get her in.

34:45.804 --> 34:47.349
Where's your father?

34:47.351 --> 34:49.004
You look like you swallowed poison.

34:49.007 --> 34:50.860
- That woman from last night...
- Talon?

34:50.862 --> 34:52.596
Yes. Wythers is going
to cut off her head.

34:52.599 --> 34:54.944
- No, he's not.
- Gwynn, don't get involved.

34:54.946 --> 34:56.522
Only your father can intercede.

34:56.525 --> 34:58.458
- I owe her my life.
- Gwynn.

35:02.087 --> 35:05.521
This is wrong! He deserved what he got.

35:05.523 --> 35:07.942
Perhaps.

35:07.945 --> 35:10.378
And you deserve what
you're about to get.

35:15.333 --> 35:17.634
I, Gate Marshal Cedric Wythers,

35:17.636 --> 35:19.854
acting magistrate of Gallwood Outpost,

35:19.857 --> 35:22.205
hereby make judgment
on your mortal person.

35:22.208 --> 35:24.994
As circumstances were found
to make lawful judgment...

35:24.997 --> 35:27.349
I was right to kill him.

35:27.352 --> 35:30.295
...you're here and now condemned
for the murder of Toru Magmoor,

35:30.298 --> 35:33.424
Captain and venerable
agent of the Covenant guard

35:33.427 --> 35:36.352
in this 14th year of the
Dominion of the Prime Order.

35:36.354 --> 35:38.794
They murdered my family!

35:40.848 --> 35:43.182
For which crime you will
be sentenced to death

35:43.185 --> 35:47.964
in a manner, place, and time chosen
by this rightful judge and magistrate,

35:47.966 --> 35:49.666
which is me.

35:52.036 --> 35:54.369
And now at the hour
of your imminent death,

35:54.372 --> 35:57.278
you may utter your
final words to be spoken

35:57.281 --> 35:59.242
with your last and dying breath.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.011
I killed in self defense.

36:02.013 --> 36:06.082
But knowing his crimes, I would
have murdered the man ten times over.

36:06.084 --> 36:09.385
I regret nothing.

36:09.387 --> 36:12.288
Hmm. Good words.

36:14.559 --> 36:16.793
Just out of curiosity,

36:16.795 --> 36:19.963
"Tell Dred one remains,"

36:19.965 --> 36:22.899
what's that mean to you?

36:22.901 --> 36:25.101
If you kill me, you'll never know.

36:27.772 --> 36:31.708
Worth a try.

36:31.710 --> 36:34.677
You're a murderer just like him.

36:34.679 --> 36:36.779
The law is the law.

36:36.781 --> 36:39.286
Even vengeance has a price.

36:44.055 --> 36:47.888
As your rightful judge and executioner,

36:47.891 --> 36:50.059
the burden rests with me

36:50.061 --> 36:53.963
and no one else, with
only the gods to intervene,

36:53.965 --> 36:56.950
I hereby must take your mortal life.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.708
Stop! She is innocent.

37:06.711 --> 37:08.774
I declare it with oath and bond.

37:08.777 --> 37:11.068
- Have you got proof of this?
- I witnessed everything.

37:11.070 --> 37:12.769
She just admitted to the killing.

37:12.771 --> 37:14.541
In self defense. He attacked her.

37:14.544 --> 37:16.044
Why didn't you come here sooner?

37:16.047 --> 37:18.099
GWYNN: I had hoped she
wouldn't be discovered.

37:18.102 --> 37:21.111
By my noble station, I
set myself as her bond.

37:21.113 --> 37:23.947
The burden is mine now, by law.

37:23.949 --> 37:25.749
Don't tell me the law.

37:25.751 --> 37:27.751
It's too late for new evidence.

37:27.753 --> 37:29.912
The death sentence is irrevocable.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.288
[GASPS]

37:31.290 --> 37:33.724
Do it!

37:33.726 --> 37:37.928
<i>[MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

37:37.930 --> 37:39.997
Get out of the way!

37:49.241 --> 37:52.391
The lady gave her oath and bond.

37:55.547 --> 37:58.215
I don't care what she
says, she wasn't there.

37:58.217 --> 38:00.317
There were no witnesses.

38:00.319 --> 38:02.446
Will you dare accuse me of lying?

38:02.449 --> 38:04.553
Where did he stab her
then? How many times?

38:04.556 --> 38:07.591
Where'd she stab him? Come
on, tell us what happened.

38:07.593 --> 38:11.228
- It was dark.
- You're bearing false witness

38:11.230 --> 38:13.897
to a confessed murderer.

38:13.899 --> 38:15.732
I don't know why yet,

38:15.734 --> 38:17.857
but when the Prime Order
come to investigate,

38:17.860 --> 38:19.438
I'll get my answer.

38:19.441 --> 38:22.409
Truth has a way of coming out
when you're being skinned alive.

38:22.412 --> 38:25.540
Tread lightly, Wythers. That's
my daughter you're talking about.

38:25.543 --> 38:27.811
Then be a father.

38:27.813 --> 38:29.713
Tell her to quit this charade.

38:29.715 --> 38:34.317
Withdraw her testimony so I
can finish executing a murderer.

38:34.319 --> 38:36.686
It's the best thing for all of us.

38:36.688 --> 38:39.356
Did you ever meet Toru Magmoor?

38:39.358 --> 38:42.859
He was the filthiest part of a pig.

38:42.861 --> 38:44.701
He wanted to overtake the Outpost.

38:44.704 --> 38:48.799
How would you like that? The
Prime Order running your town.

38:48.801 --> 38:52.702
Now he's dead. And good riddance.

38:52.704 --> 38:56.773
That's what's best for all of us.

38:56.775 --> 38:59.609
Perhaps. But the Prime Order will demand

38:59.611 --> 39:02.712
a life to pay for the
death of their officer.

39:02.714 --> 39:05.182
And we have a murderer in custody.

39:05.184 --> 39:08.185
A girl that means nothing to anyone.

39:08.187 --> 39:10.974
Cut her head off and this
whole thing disappears.

39:10.977 --> 39:12.956
Couldn't be more perfect.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.724
He makes a good point, Gwynn.

39:14.726 --> 39:16.159
I won't allow it.

39:16.161 --> 39:17.828
Won't allow it?

39:17.830 --> 39:19.496
Gwynn, please.

39:19.498 --> 39:22.132
He attacked her. He nearly killed her.

39:22.134 --> 39:24.301
He was a Covenant officer.

39:24.303 --> 39:26.803
The Prime Order will
descend on this Outpost

39:26.805 --> 39:29.539
like flies to a dung pile. And for what?

39:29.541 --> 39:31.241
Some girlish whim?

39:31.243 --> 39:34.644
- Father, I pledged my bond.
- You better unpledge it then!

39:34.646 --> 39:36.980
Damn it, Wythers, just get out.

39:39.418 --> 39:43.787
I take that to mean
finish the execution.

39:43.789 --> 39:46.623
Yes.

39:46.625 --> 39:49.793
Commander Calkussar,
I will not allow it.

39:49.795 --> 39:51.862
Set her free.

39:56.068 --> 39:57.601
[EXHALES DEEPLY]

39:57.603 --> 40:00.504
Set her free.

40:00.506 --> 40:03.440
What?

40:03.442 --> 40:07.016
You let a child tell you what to do?

40:07.019 --> 40:08.993
Just do as I say.
