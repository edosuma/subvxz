- Grandpa, good, you're here.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.081
Hey.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.018
- Did you see the new, flashy
 Brandini sign on your way in?

01:26.053 --> 01:29.288
- They love reminding people
 about their contest wins.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.923
Not this time. (Frank chuckles)

01:30.958 --> 01:32.958
- It'll only be fair for
    a ranch like Cabella,

01:32.993 --> 01:35.828
where we actually do the
    work ourselves, to win.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.296
- (sighs) I know.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.797
(door opens)

01:38.833 --> 01:41.433
- Oh. (chuckles)

01:41.469 --> 01:44.303
- Oh. (chuckles)

01:44.338 --> 01:45.637
- [Gloria] Hi, we didn't
    hear you come home.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.640
- How could you over
     the music? (chuckles)

01:48.676 --> 01:50.476
- Your mother, your mo...

01:50.511 --> 01:53.679
Your mother signed us up
 for, uh, for a dance class,

01:53.714 --> 01:54.513
it's our first day.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.647
- Dance class?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.382
Seriously?

01:57.418 --> 01:59.384
May I remind you of our
ill-fated father/daughter dance

01:59.420 --> 02:00.652
in third grade?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.454
- A little embarrassment
    for my only daughter

02:02.490 --> 02:04.823
was worth it for the
     grin on her face.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.492
- I mean, it's not
    like I was much better.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.894
- It's the Cabella curse,
  two left feet. (chuckles)

02:08.929 --> 02:10.195
- Before you go,
        (upbeat music)

02:10.231 --> 02:11.763
there's something
     we need to discuss.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.532
- All right.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.436
- Ready?

02:19.707 --> 02:22.641
- Grandpa has decided it's
  time for him to retire.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.945
And I'm gonna take
      over Cabella Oil.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.048
(Tom chuckles)

02:30.084 --> 02:31.350
- Are you sure?

02:31.385 --> 02:32.484
- I wanna relax,
      travel the world,

02:32.520 --> 02:36.088
but my protege here will
 continue the Cabella legacy.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.856
- This is such wonderful news.

02:37.892 --> 02:38.557
Do you feel like you're ready

02:38.592 --> 02:40.325
for this responsibility, Nicole?

02:40.361 --> 02:41.326
- Of course she is.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.362
- Grandpa has been
 training me my entire life,

02:43.397 --> 02:46.832
and I have big ideas to take
 the ranch to the next level.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.500
- Beginning with
        the competition.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.902
- [Gloria] You're
      entering again?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.270
- Obviously.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.205
- I just don't wanna see
    you disappointed, honey.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.107
- She can't help herself.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.608
Olive oil is in her blood.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.510
Heck, it may even be her blood.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.211
(Nicole chuckles)

02:59.246 --> 03:00.379
- Adam and I have been studying

03:00.414 --> 03:01.880
new techniques for our recipe,

03:01.916 --> 03:05.250
and I really think we finally
 have a shot this year.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.554
(upbeat music)

03:11.592 --> 03:12.791
(phone rings)

03:12.826 --> 03:14.560
- Oh, guys, one second.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.297
Granddad, how are you?

03:18.332 --> 03:18.997
- Hiya, Jake.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.465
Hey, it's olive-harvest season,

03:20.501 --> 03:21.900
I thought perhaps
    you'd like to come down

03:21.936 --> 03:23.402
to Sunset Valley
        for the weekend?

03:23.437 --> 03:26.071
- Uh, this weekend?
 - I could probably give you

03:26.106 --> 03:28.440
that traditional olive oil
 lesson we've been planning.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.575
It's perfect timing,

03:29.610 --> 03:31.810
we're developing our submission
for the annual contest.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.413
- Well, you know I'd
     love to, uh, but--

03:34.448 --> 03:36.481
- But you've got work
     to keep you busy.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.116
- Yeah, actually I do.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.285
In fact, I'm due
     in court right now.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.286
- No, of course.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.590
Hey, break a leg.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.725
- Thanks, Granddad, I will.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.696
(upbeat music)

03:56.503 --> 03:58.136
- Ready to work
      on another batch?

03:58.172 --> 03:59.504
- Yes, I am.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.974
But first, guess what,

04:02.009 --> 04:03.675
I'm officially in
      charge of Cabella.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.177
- What?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.479
Oh, my god, that's
  amazing! (Nicole chuckles)

04:07.514 --> 04:08.547
But, wait,

04:08.682 --> 04:09.681
I'm not gonna have to start
 calling you boss, am I?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.917
- Well, technically...

04:11.952 --> 04:13.518
- After working
    together for six years?

04:13.554 --> 04:15.621
- Six years?

04:15.656 --> 04:16.555
Has it been that long?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.255
- It was only supposed
     to be for a summer

04:17.291 --> 04:18.589
while you apprentice with Frank,

04:18.625 --> 04:19.858
but here I am.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.261
- Head ranch hand,
     and my best friend.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.997
- Well, consider this best
 friend thoroughly impressed.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.531
So what are you working on here?

04:26.567 --> 04:29.701
- Um, it's my concept for
expanding the tasting facility.

04:29.737 --> 04:30.969
I just, you know,

04:31.005 --> 04:31.870
I don't know if I'm
     ready to take on

04:31.905 --> 04:33.272
a big renovation like this.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.141
- Well, I approve.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.776
Have you found a contractor?

04:37.811 --> 04:39.311
- Yep.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.613
And I filed a
     construction permit.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.683
(Adam gasps)

04:44.718 --> 04:45.951
- I am so proud of you.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.486
- Okay, let's get cracking,

04:47.521 --> 04:49.388
because this olive oil contest
 isn't gonna win itself.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.389
(upbeat music)
         So let's go.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.256
- Yep.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.997
- Jake,

04:59.033 --> 05:00.532
congrats on the big win.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.667
Great job.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.501
- Thank you, Julie.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.535
(phone rings)

05:03.570 --> 05:04.336
Oh.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.170
- Of course.

05:05.205 --> 05:05.971
We'll talk later?

05:06.006 --> 05:08.073
- Right. (clears throat)

05:08.108 --> 05:10.108
Hey, Mom, great news--

05:12.212 --> 05:13.945
What do you mean,
      is Granddad okay?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.348
I'm on my way.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.283
Can you, uh, take
     care of this for me?

05:19.053 --> 05:20.319
(upbeat music)

05:20.354 --> 05:21.853
- Okay, before Grandpa
    leaves on his vacation,

05:21.889 --> 05:24.089
I wanted to show
     you all of my plans

05:24.124 --> 05:26.658
for expanding the ranch.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.726
- Wow.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.729
You weren't kidding
  about having grand ideas.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.898
- Well, it's still
     a work in progress,

05:32.933 --> 05:34.433
but this is what I had in mind.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.601
We'd offer the same
    tastings we already do,

05:36.637 --> 05:38.537
but on a much bigger scale.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.073
We'd add a terrace with a bistro

05:41.108 --> 05:44.042
and finally showcase
     the beautiful view.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.445
Adam had some really great ideas

05:46.480 --> 05:48.914
for its rustic, chic design.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.716
- Aww, Adam is such a sweetie.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.384
I don't know why the two
    of you aren't together.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.386
- (chuckles) I'm
        hardly his type.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.855
Let's stay focused on the plan.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.725
So, what are your thoughts?

06:00.761 --> 06:03.562
- Well, if you can pull it
  off, it'll be wonderful.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.430
- [Gloria] What
      do you think, Dad?

06:07.301 --> 06:08.367
- I love it.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.302
(Nicole and Frank chuckle)

06:10.337 --> 06:11.069
- Really?

06:11.105 --> 06:11.870
(Gloria chuckles)

06:11.905 --> 06:13.705
- Yeah. (chuckles)

06:13.741 --> 06:15.107
- Yes. (chuckles)

06:15.142 --> 06:15.907
(upbeat music)

06:15.943 --> 06:16.975
- Mom.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.744
- Jake, how was the drive?

06:18.779 --> 06:19.644
- What does that matter?

06:19.680 --> 06:20.746
How's Granddad?

06:20.781 --> 06:21.646
- Well, you know--

06:21.682 --> 06:23.615
- He is perfectly all right.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.885
And I do not need this thing.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.487
Ow!

06:28.522 --> 06:29.388
- He fell and broke his arm.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.124
Dad, you're anything
     but all right, Dad.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.925
- Jake, what on earth
     are you doing here?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.261
- Well, Mom said you
     were in the hospital,

06:36.296 --> 06:37.396
and so I came right away.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.832
- Honestly, Eleanor, did you
 have to make such a fuss?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.734
- [Maxwell] Come on,
     let's get you home.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.802
- You were in the hospital.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.737
- [Raphael] Oh, I know,
 you're a sweet, sweet girl,

06:45.773 --> 06:48.840
but really, there's
     nothing wrong with me.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.475
- Mom, why did you
      make it sound like

06:50.511 --> 06:51.543
he was having a
      medical emergency?

06:51.578 --> 06:54.446
- Well, I didn't know how
  serious his injury was

06:54.481 --> 06:55.580
when I spoke to you.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.949
Besides, I thought that it
 might motivate you to come.

06:57.985 --> 06:58.917
- You're kidding?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.318
I was frantic.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.087
- Well, if you
     visited more often,

07:02.122 --> 07:03.989
I wouldn't have
      to be so creative.

07:05.793 --> 07:06.858
(upbeat music)

07:06.894 --> 07:09.428
(Jake sighs)

07:22.342 --> 07:24.142
- Thanks. What can I do
    for you, my good man?

07:24.178 --> 07:26.311
- Can I get a cold
     brew to go, please?

07:26.346 --> 07:28.313
- I'm afraid we only
  carry the hard stuff here.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.781
- That's fine.

07:29.817 --> 07:30.816
- Jake.

07:30.851 --> 07:31.650
- Billy.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.951
- Is that you?

07:32.986 --> 07:34.019
- What are you doing
     in Sunset Valley?

07:34.054 --> 07:35.487
- Yeah, yeah, still here.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.456
Big fish, small
      pond, as they say.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.623
- Hmm.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.326
- I bought this place a few
 years back, it's my spot now.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.861
- Well, that's great.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.396
- You're no slouch either,
  look at this getup,

07:44.431 --> 07:45.530
I'm gonna have to
      charge you double.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.798
- For this service, hardly.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.867
(Billy chuckles)

07:48.902 --> 07:50.469
Traitor.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.638
- No, no, we are an
 equal-opportunity supplier.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.706
We don't take sides here.

07:54.842 --> 07:58.076
- Because if you did, you'd
 have to choose Cabella.

07:58.111 --> 07:58.777
Hey, Billy.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.645
- Hey, I'll go grab your order.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.480
- Thanks.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.215
- Wow.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.684
You sure clean up nice.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.185
- Excuse me?

08:07.221 --> 08:08.520
- You don't recognize me?

08:09.556 --> 08:12.224
Bit of a hit to the ego,
  but I think I can recover.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.526
- Oh, all you had to say was ego

08:14.561 --> 08:17.195
and the memories just came
  flooding back. (chuckles)

08:17.231 --> 08:20.732
If it isn't Jake Brandini,
  ghost of childhood's past.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.534
- You still living with
    your folks at the ranch?

08:22.569 --> 08:25.403
- Oh, actually, I
      run Cabella now.

08:25.439 --> 08:28.840
- Wow, congrats, I remember
 that was always the dream.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.776
- You remember something
  I said when we were kids?

08:31.812 --> 08:35.046
- Uh, I also remember that
time where you tripped and fell

08:35.082 --> 08:36.615
after we raced to the factory.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.417
- (chuckles) Yes, but if
 memory serves, I won, so...

08:39.453 --> 08:40.952
- Yeah, that part,
      I don't recall.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.187
- Oh, no, you don't recall, huh?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.221
- No.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.289
- Okay. (chuckles)

08:44.324 --> 08:45.891
Well, time sure flies

08:45.926 --> 08:47.859
when you're becoming a
  big-time corporate lawyer.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.595
I...

08:50.631 --> 08:51.696
That's, I heard
     that's what you do.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.597
- Oh, did you?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.232
- Uh, thanks, Billy.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.135
Here you go.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.470
- Oh, thanks.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.573
- Well, that was sure
     a blast from the past.

09:01.608 --> 09:04.876
See you in, what,
      another 15 years?

09:06.413 --> 09:07.512
- Bye, Sticky Nicki.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.516
- Nobody calls me that anymore.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.753
- [Billy] So, how long
     you in town anyway?

09:14.788 --> 09:16.821
- Head back to San
     Francisco tomorrow.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.223
- I guess those
      tech zillionaires

09:18.258 --> 09:19.791
aren't gonna sue themselves.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.092
- Someone's gotta do it.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.962
(soft music) You
     know, on my way back,

09:23.997 --> 09:26.932
I noticed the Cabellas are
building near the property line.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.334
Anyway, hey, Granddad,
     maybe after breakfast,

09:29.369 --> 09:30.835
you can give me that
 lesson we've been planning.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.738
- Oh, no, he's on strict
    orders to take it easy.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.574
We still don't know
    what caused him to fall,

09:35.609 --> 09:37.475
and he shouldn't be
    operating any machinery.

09:37.511 --> 09:38.677
- Okay.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.312
Well, how about a
    stroll of the property?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.581
To the Cabella border and
  back, for old times' sake.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.915
- Yeah.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.482
- I don't know what
     ever appealed to you

09:44.518 --> 09:45.951
about going over there.

09:45.986 --> 09:46.885
- Not after the
      way Frank Cabella

09:46.920 --> 09:48.653
treated your grandfather.
  (upbeat music)

09:48.689 --> 09:49.955
(Raphael sighs)

09:49.990 --> 09:51.289
- Are you guys ever
     gonna let that go?

09:53.293 --> 09:54.926
- I don't see why
      your new terrace

09:54.962 --> 09:57.295
has to be so close to
     the Brandini border.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.531
How can you handle the
  proximity to that family?

09:59.566 --> 10:00.632
- Based on the budget,

10:00.667 --> 10:03.101
we can only afford to expand
 the existing facility,

10:03.136 --> 10:04.169
not start fresh.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.704
- And it should be fine.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.106
I've never seen anyone
 from Brandini's over there.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.642
Mr. Cabella,

10:10.677 --> 10:12.477
didn't you guys start
     the ranch together?

10:12.512 --> 10:13.812
What went wrong?

10:13.847 --> 10:15.013
- Well...

10:15.048 --> 10:17.115
- Here we go again.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.383
- Right out of the gate,

10:18.418 --> 10:19.951
we were doing better
     than we expected.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.086
I wanted to make some big moves.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.689
- Raphael was offered a
lucrative opportunity to expand,

10:24.725 --> 10:26.658
so he decided to squeeze me out.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.661
- I begged Frank to join in
 on the international project,

10:29.696 --> 10:30.996
but he refused.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.163
- He started making
     deals behind my back.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.000
- All I wanted was to confirm
 that the offers were sound

10:35.035 --> 10:36.534
before I presented them.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.503
- He was willing to
 abandon years of friendship

10:38.538 --> 10:39.704
just to build an empire.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.839
- He never even let me explain.

10:40.941 --> 10:44.009
- So we split up the ranch
 and went our separate ways.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.043
- To this day,

10:45.078 --> 10:45.944
I've never met anyone

10:45.979 --> 10:48.046
who knew his way around
    an olive oil press

10:48.081 --> 10:48.980
better than Frank Cabella.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.916
- The Cabellas only
    care about being right.

10:51.952 --> 10:55.053
- The Brandinis only care
  about the bottom line.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.328
- Come on.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.030
Let's go for that stroll.

11:05.065 --> 11:05.897
- Sure, Granddad.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.168
- Hey, I wanna show you
  the old map that I found.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.837
- [Maxwell] (scoffs) Cabellas
 and that property line.

11:14.908 --> 11:18.877
- Are you sure this
     map is accurate?

11:18.912 --> 11:21.613
- I don't know why it
 wouldn't be, why do you ask?

11:21.648 --> 11:23.948
- 'Cause based on
     these property lines,

11:23.984 --> 11:27.886
the border goes right through
 that, which is encroachment.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.587
- Hmm.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.694
(upbeat music)

11:35.729 --> 11:39.064
- Jake, twice in two days.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.966
Did you, uh, did you come
 looking for some quality oil?

11:42.002 --> 11:44.602
- Why? Do you stock
     Brandini's now?

11:44.638 --> 11:46.037
(Nicole chuckles)

11:46.073 --> 11:47.672
- How do you do, Mr. Brandini?

11:48.909 --> 11:49.607
- Hello, Nicole.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.078
- So, uh, what's all this?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.746
- This is the site

11:54.781 --> 11:57.048
of my future world-renowned
 dining and tasting facility.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.317
- Well, I'm afraid you
    may have to relocate it,

11:59.352 --> 12:02.053
because it appears
      to be on our land.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.257
Right through that.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.092
- What?

12:08.695 --> 12:11.262
Um, I'll be right back.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.063
- Sure.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.001
- What brings you by, Raphael?

12:17.037 --> 12:20.505
- Well, my grandson has made
 a fascinating discovery,

12:20.540 --> 12:22.774
it seems that you
     might be in violation

12:22.809 --> 12:23.875
of our original land agreement.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.945
- Mr. Cabella, if you could
 just take a look at this.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.649
- Are you arms the only
    thing broken, Raphael?

12:31.685 --> 12:32.951
Violation?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.185
That's absurd.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.954
- Your information is way off,

12:35.989 --> 12:38.189
according to this deed,
    we have plenty of room.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.325
- Well, this deed
     hasn't been witnessed.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.160
And there's no way you can
  prove its authenticity.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.962
Based on this official map,

12:45.065 --> 12:46.064
your property ends here.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.136
- [Nicole] There.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.370
- Mm,

12:52.405 --> 12:53.505
here.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.606
- There.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.473
- Mm,

12:55.509 --> 12:56.307
here.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.111
- We have been using
     this land for decades.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.914
- Well, for now,
     you'll have to stop.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.919
(Nicole scoffs)

13:14.161 --> 13:17.428
- An injunction, Jake filed
 an injunction against me.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.632
- Here's a copy
      of the complaint,

13:20.667 --> 13:21.766
she shoulda received
     it this morning.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.135
She can't proceed with any
  of the construction plans

13:24.171 --> 13:25.670
until the matter's resolved.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.039
- Look, is this really
 something we should pursue?

13:28.074 --> 13:29.240
- Of course we should.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.875
An agreement's an agreement,

13:30.911 --> 13:33.011
the Cabellas are required
  to adhere to the terms.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.547
- So many years have
     already gone by.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.749
- Do you want me to
     cancel my cruise?

13:37.784 --> 13:40.151
- No way, you deserve this trip,

13:40.187 --> 13:42.954
plus, there's no chance
 that Jake's theory holds up.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.191
- I know you'll
      figure it all out.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.425
(soft music)

13:47.460 --> 13:49.093
- Do you still think
     I'm good enough

13:49.129 --> 13:50.094
to run this company on my
  own? Because I'm afraid.

13:50.130 --> 13:54.165
- Oh, my dear, you are
     more than good enough.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.034
You're the future
      of Cabella Oil.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.172
- I'll be back in a couple
 of weeks for the court date.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.541
- You really wanna do that?

14:03.577 --> 14:05.877
- Maybe we can
     settle this quietly.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.212
- They wouldn't want
     the negative publicity

14:07.247 --> 14:08.847
impacting their image.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.048
- That's true.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.482
Maybe we can settle
     this quietly.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.599
- Still working on your
    construction plans?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.234
- (sighs) It needs
      to be ready to go

14:29.269 --> 14:31.202
once we get the green
     light from the judge.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.339
- And if we don't
     get the green light?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.208
- I can't let my mind go there.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.278
I already gave a large deposit
 to the construction company

14:40.313 --> 14:42.647
before Jake
    interrupted everything.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.283
- Well, Cabella could
    still recover from that.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.951
- Maybe,

14:46.987 --> 14:50.255
but I can't let my first big
 move be a massive disaster,

14:50.290 --> 14:52.156
I couldn't recover from that.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.258
- Okay, well,

14:53.293 --> 14:54.959
before you drive yourself
  crazy with the hearing,

14:54.995 --> 14:56.427
let's focus on our
     contest submission.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.097
So this batch combines
     our buttery texture

14:59.132 --> 15:00.665
that we liked from batch 12

15:00.700 --> 15:02.800
with the concentration
     from batch 27.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.472
- No, it's still
      missing something.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.273
(Adam sighs)

15:08.308 --> 15:09.941
- You always say that.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.143
- I just, I don't know what
 it needs, this is hopeless.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.079
- Let's try a slight reduction
 of the core temperature

15:15.115 --> 15:15.980
on the next batch.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.684
- What would I do without you?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.686
- Develop subpar oil?

15:21.721 --> 15:24.122
- Yeah. (chuckles)

15:26.293 --> 15:31.296
(Nicole sighs)
         (upbeat music)

15:32.899 --> 15:34.098
- How's discovery progressing

15:34.134 --> 15:35.500
on the Atkinson copyright case?

15:35.535 --> 15:37.702
- Well, the startup we
     filed the suit against

15:37.737 --> 15:39.637
definitely infringed
     on the graphic, but--

15:39.673 --> 15:41.172
- But?

15:41.207 --> 15:43.441
- But if we win, the
  startup will go bankrupt.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.676
We could negotiate.

15:44.711 --> 15:45.510
- No chance.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.446
The partners are really
  impressed with you, Jake.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.350
(Jake sighs)

15:52.385 --> 15:55.086
(upbeat music)

15:56.656 --> 15:58.189
(judge bangs gavel)

15:58.224 --> 16:00.158
- You both have
     compelling evidence,

16:00.193 --> 16:01.859
but I can't rule on this

16:01.895 --> 16:04.963
without seeing a forensic
  investigation first.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.798
- We're willing to do
 whatever it takes, Your Honor.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.032
- So are we.

16:08.068 --> 16:11.135
- Well, even then, it'll
    take time and money.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.738
I suggest you find
     a private resolution

16:13.773 --> 16:18.309
so I can get back to judging
 your olive oil submissions.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.577
Wait,

16:19.612 --> 16:20.411
that's it.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.046
- What is, Judge Monroe?

16:22.082 --> 16:25.283
- Whichever ranch wins the
 contest also wins the land.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.319
- With all due respect, Your
 Honor, you can't be serious?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.355
- Well, you're competing
    anyway, aren't you?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.590
This would save you the
    trouble of litigation.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.825
- This is highly unconventional.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.694
- I know, isn't it exciting?

16:36.730 --> 16:38.329
- It would speed things up.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.234
But what do you know
     about making oil?

16:43.269 --> 16:44.602
- How hard can it be?

16:44.637 --> 16:45.937
Why?

16:45.972 --> 16:48.239
Are you afraid of
     a little challenge?

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
- Absolutely not.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.376
- Then we have a deal?

16:55.782 --> 16:56.581
- Deal.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.053
(judge bangs gavel)

17:02.088 --> 17:02.820
(upbeat music)

17:02.856 --> 17:03.921
What did I just do?

17:05.258 --> 17:06.491
Did I seriously just bet

17:06.526 --> 17:09.127
the future of the
     ranch on a contest?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.728
- So it would seem.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.096
- What was I thinking?

17:12.132 --> 17:14.732
- Just relax, take
      a deep breath.

17:14.768 --> 17:17.135
- No, but if we, if we
     lose the competition,

17:17.170 --> 17:18.935
we won't simply be forced
  to abandon construction,

17:18.972 --> 17:20.605
I will have failed
     my grandpa's belief

17:20.640 --> 17:22.507
that I can take
      over this company.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.075
- Okay, so we won't.

17:24.109 --> 17:25.009
- We won't what?

17:25.045 --> 17:25.843
- We won't lose.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.679
- You say that like
     it is so simple.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.847
- Before Jake got to town,

17:29.883 --> 17:31.149
you had all the
    confidence in the world.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.984
- That was when all
     that was at stake

17:33.019 --> 17:34.819
was a trophy and my pride.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.357
- A winning submission is
 still a winning submission,

17:39.392 --> 17:40.558
no matter the prize.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.163
- I just spoke with my boss,

17:45.198 --> 17:47.131
I'm not going back to
     San Francisco until
     after the contest.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.700
If I'm gonna win this thing,
 I'm gonna need to stay here.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.035
- Wonderful.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.103
It's about time you
     took some interest.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.372
You should ask your
 grandfather for some pointers.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.340
- And you'll get to
    enjoy the Fall Festival,

17:56.376 --> 17:58.176
it's the highlight of the year.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.544
(Jake chuckles)

17:59.579 --> 18:01.946
- It's one, two, three.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.681
- There's forward and
    then there's back two--

18:03.716 --> 18:05.183
- (sighs) Top of the morning.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.117
- You sound chipper.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.819
- Well, a good night's
     sleep does wonders.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.054
Thank you. I am off to
  town to grab a few things,

18:10.090 --> 18:11.823
then it's back to
      the salt mines.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.159
I really think Adam and I are
 close to cracking the recipe.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.694
Mm, it's good.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.796
Yep, I think we're really close.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.099
- Great.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.535
- Maybe we should call my dad

18:24.571 --> 18:26.537
and have him settle
     with the Brandinis,

18:26.573 --> 18:29.907
instead of relying on
  the results of a contest.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.778
- No, no, I won't let them take
advantage of us, not again.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.314
- I wish she wasn't
     so impulsive.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.053
- Oh, glad to see
      you out, Raphael.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.254
- Afternoon, Judge.

18:43.389 --> 18:46.157
- Well, I reckon you won't be
 golfing with us anytime soon.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.226
- Ron Evans.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.327
- Jake Brandini.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.395
- High school principal,
  oil judge extraordinaire.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.497
You know, your
      grandfather spends

18:52.532 --> 18:53.831
the better part of 18 holes

18:53.867 --> 18:55.600
just bragging about
     your accomplishments.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.801
- Is that so?

18:57.770 --> 19:00.171
Well, that's very nice
     to hear, Mr. Evans.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.105
- We should be on our way,

19:01.241 --> 19:03.274
it would be poor form
     for two of the judges

19:03.309 --> 19:06.711
to be seen fraternizing
  with the incumbent winner.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.612
Bye now.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.379
- [Ron] Nice to meet you.

19:08.414 --> 19:09.213
- You too.

19:10.416 --> 19:14.685
So I spent all night last
 night researching oil-making.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.054
I found a surprising number of
 online instructional videos.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.289
- That's a good start,

19:18.324 --> 19:20.358
but you can't learn
    about oil from research,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.193
you have to put
      your back into it.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.027
- Oh.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.131
Okay then, well, will you
 show me around the factory?

19:27.167 --> 19:28.099
- I'd love to.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.133
(Nicole sighs)

19:29.169 --> 19:30.301
- (sighs) Oh, god.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.036
- Oh,

19:32.071 --> 19:33.271
let me give you a hand.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.372
(upbeat music)

19:34.407 --> 19:35.673
Oh, it's you.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.442
I didn't realize, may I?

19:38.478 --> 19:40.044
- Nope.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.445
And I thought nothing was
 gonna put a damper on my day.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.914
I will be fine, thanks.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.248
- Come on, everyone
     knows you're athletic,

19:44.284 --> 19:44.949
there's no need to be a hero.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.151
- I don't need you to rescue me,

19:47.187 --> 19:49.253
and I am hardly a
     damsel in distress.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.757
- That might be the last thing
 I'd ever use to describe you.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.792
Come on, Nicki, let me help.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.093
- The name is Nicole,

19:56.129 --> 19:57.295
and I would rather
      not accept help

19:57.330 --> 19:59.030
from the person causing
    me endless grief.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.904
He is inescapable.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.472
I don't see him for 15 years,

20:08.508 --> 20:11.976
and now I can't go 10 minutes
 without bumping into him.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.245
- Weren't you guys friends
  when you were younger?

20:14.280 --> 20:15.146
- Not exactly.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.080
He lived in San Francisco,

20:16.115 --> 20:17.648
but he spent summers
    here when we were kids,

20:17.684 --> 20:19.650
and we used to meet
     up by the border.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.186
- All right, so what
    was he like growing up?

20:22.222 --> 20:24.188
- He always had to
     have the best toys,

20:24.224 --> 20:26.857
and then you had to endure a
 lecture on all of his rules

20:26.893 --> 20:28.626
before you could play
     with any of them.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.194
(Adam chuckles)

20:30.230 --> 20:31.696
- We should take this
     energy, bottle it up,

20:31.731 --> 20:33.331
and see what it
     does to our flavor.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.465
- I am just frustrated,

20:34.500 --> 20:36.133
it is hard to deal with someone
like him who has it all,

20:36.169 --> 20:38.269
brains, privilege, good looks.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.370
- Good looks, huh?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.539
- Okay, if you like the
 traditionally-handsome guys,

20:41.574 --> 20:42.506
I suppose.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.342
He is, he is not my type.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.177
- Uh-huh, well, he
    might not be your type,

20:46.212 --> 20:47.545
but would it kill you

20:47.580 --> 20:49.013
to get your head out
     of the olive press,

20:49.048 --> 20:50.348
go out for a night on the town?

20:50.383 --> 20:51.315
- I go out.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.217
- Yeah, with me and our friends,

20:53.253 --> 20:55.386
but I mean out
      out, as in a date.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.955
- That is the last
      thing on my mind,

20:57.991 --> 20:59.423
and you should talk.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.494
- I just haven't met
    anyone interesting yet.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.330
- You will, just takes time.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.302
(upbeat music)

21:14.374 --> 21:17.108
(Nicole sighs)

21:19.512 --> 21:22.280
(Nicole sighs)

21:32.358 --> 21:36.160
Oh, you have got
      to be kidding me.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.562
(Nicole sighs)

21:38.598 --> 21:40.164
What are you doing over here?

21:41.067 --> 21:41.832
- Oh.

21:42.735 --> 21:43.534
Good afternoon.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.204
I needed somewhere quiet to
 work while I stayed here,

21:47.240 --> 21:50.241
so I set up a temporary office.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.377
It also allows me to keep
  an eye on my property.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.513
- Staying here, as
      in Sunset Valley?

21:55.548 --> 21:57.415
- Yeah, just until
     I win back the land.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.917
- You are actually taking
  a spin at production,

21:59.952 --> 22:02.253
you sure you even know
  what olive oil is made of?

22:02.288 --> 22:03.554
- I can work at my job remotely

22:03.589 --> 22:05.222
and prepare for
      the contest here.

22:05.258 --> 22:06.791
Two birds, one stone.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.294
- Is one of your birds the
 culprit responsible for this?

22:10.330 --> 22:11.228
- I didn't want you
     getting any ideas

22:11.264 --> 22:13.264
about moving forward
     with your expansion.

22:13.299 --> 22:16.267
Considering you're here, I
  was right to be concerned.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.270
You always did take the
 rules a little too liberally.

22:19.305 --> 22:20.738
- Okay, if you're referring to

22:20.773 --> 22:22.707
the Sunset Valley Camp
     presidential election,

22:22.742 --> 22:25.242
I maintain I used
    valid campaign tactics,

22:25.278 --> 22:27.611
you didn't have to
     file your grievances.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.280
- You shoulda
     checked the handbook,

22:29.315 --> 22:30.581
that's all I'm saying.

22:30.616 --> 22:31.849
- You are still
      exactly the same.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.920
- You were so upset
     with me after that.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.623
Was that why you stopped
    coming to meet me here?

22:41.761 --> 22:42.693
- Yeah, totally.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.730
Later, Jake.

22:45.765 --> 22:46.530
- Bye, Nicole.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.168
- Welcome, everyone.

22:51.204 --> 22:54.305
We are kicking off another
  fantastic Fall Festival,

22:54.340 --> 22:57.475
so grab an apple cider
    while they're still hot.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.410
(applause)

22:59.445 --> 23:01.312
- Oh, uh, I'm
     afraid that's taken.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.420
- And remember, the
     final event on day 10

23:09.455 --> 23:12.456
is our very prestigious
    olive oil competition,

23:12.492 --> 23:14.425
which is always quite exciting.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.961
So grab a brochure,

23:16.996 --> 23:20.164
we have lots of fun things
lined up over the next 10 days,

23:20.199 --> 23:22.266
including the big race,

23:22.301 --> 23:24.101
the Cornucopia 500.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.470
(applause)

23:31.477 --> 23:32.309
- Oh-oh.

23:32.345 --> 23:33.144
Oh, oh.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.482
(Nicole chuckles)

23:40.420 --> 23:41.819
- Here you go.

23:41.854 --> 23:42.987
Jake.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.321
My VIP finally made it.

23:44.357 --> 23:46.557
Come on, I saved you the
    best seat in the house.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.358
- Thanks, Billy.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.459
- [Billy] No problem.

23:48.494 --> 23:49.460
(Billy uses noisemaker)

23:49.495 --> 23:50.528
- Attention, all.

23:50.563 --> 23:53.497
The sign-up for tomorrow's
  apple-picking contest

23:53.533 --> 23:54.465
is now open.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.733
Who will be the victor?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.968
Find out tomorrow, right
    here in Sunset Valley.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.871
- I'm in.
         (upbeat music)

24:00.907 --> 24:01.705
- [Billy] Thank you.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.345
- Me too.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.623
(upbeat music)

24:19.659 --> 24:21.325
- Welcome, everyone.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.827
Okay, on my go,

24:22.862 --> 24:24.361
you will have
     exactly three minutes

24:24.397 --> 24:26.897
to collect as many
     red apples as you can

24:26.933 --> 24:27.998
and bring your
     baskets back to me.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.135
That's red apples, no green
 apples will be accepted.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.003
- Are you taking notes?

24:33.039 --> 24:33.938
(Jake scoffs)

24:33.973 --> 24:35.840
- Okay, the person with
    the heaviest basket

24:35.875 --> 24:38.742
wins a dinner for two at
    the Sunset Valley Diner.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.178
- Does that dinner
  include a bottle of wine?

24:41.214 --> 24:43.180
- I might throw in a
 bottle for a lucky someone.

24:43.216 --> 24:45.082
On your marks,

24:45.117 --> 24:46.684
get set,

24:46.719 --> 24:47.518
go.

24:53.726 --> 24:54.825
- What, are you making
     a pie afterwards?

24:54.861 --> 24:58.229
Why are you being so picky?
 - I only want the best.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.763
- Oh, so typical.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.266
- Slow and steady wins the race.

25:02.301 --> 25:03.901
Timeless saying for a reason.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.073
(rings bell)

25:09.108 --> 25:11.208
- That's your
    one-minute mark, people,

25:11.244 --> 25:12.743
one minute remaining!

25:19.919 --> 25:21.252
- You sure you're gonna be
 able to handle all of that?

25:21.287 --> 25:22.686
Looks a little precarious.

25:28.261 --> 25:29.527
- You're safe, safe,

25:29.562 --> 25:31.595
you're safe, safe.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.429
- Oh.

25:33.266 --> 25:34.265
(Nicole groans)

25:34.300 --> 25:35.165
- Oh, no.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.269
You're safe, safe,
     safe, very good job.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.037
(Adam sighs)

25:40.072 --> 25:41.338
Very safe, safe.

25:42.308 --> 25:43.807
Safe.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.109
And time.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.744
- Oh, come on.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.779
- Jake, I am very sorry,
  but you are disqualified.

25:48.814 --> 25:50.114
(Jake sighs)
      (Nicole chuckles)

25:50.149 --> 25:53.384
Ah, Nicole, half a
      bushel, very sad.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.953
(Nicole sighs)

25:55.988 --> 25:57.021
Good job, everyone.

25:57.823 --> 25:59.290
Nice apple picking.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.658
(Jake chuckles)

26:00.693 --> 26:03.260
(Jake sighs)

26:04.297 --> 26:07.031
(clears throat) Can I have
  your attention, please?

26:08.267 --> 26:12.570
With an impressive
     22 pounds of apples,

26:12.605 --> 26:15.406
the winner is Adam Caulfield.

26:15.441 --> 26:16.574
- What?

26:16.609 --> 26:20.177
(applause)
      (Nicole chuckles)

26:20.212 --> 26:21.612
- The grand prize, good sir.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.660
Hey, at least you
     and Nicole both lost.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.461
- I guess?

26:37.496 --> 26:39.196
- Well, I, for one,

26:39.231 --> 26:40.764
was in no mood for
     a Brandini/Cabella
     feud-induced argument.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.267
- Yeah, but Adam won, so
    it's like she won too.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.636
- How do you mean?

26:45.671 --> 26:47.605
- She's obviously
     gonna be his plus-one.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.177
- We'll see.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.213
- Is your ankle
     okay, Sticky Nicki?

26:56.248 --> 26:57.081
I mean Nicole.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.316
Old habits.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.119
You want, uh, you want some ice?

27:03.155 --> 27:06.156
- I'm fine, it was just a
 little twist, but thank you.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.959
- Why do you call
      her that anyway?

27:08.995 --> 27:10.461
- Sticky Nicki?

27:10.496 --> 27:12.229
I thought everyone knew that.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.564
We were doing a
      three-legged race,

27:13.599 --> 27:16.033
she was going way too
     fast for her own good,

27:16.068 --> 27:18.335
tripped, fell, gum
    went flying in the air,

27:18.371 --> 27:19.503
she landed on top of it.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.672
Before we realized,
     it was too late,

27:21.707 --> 27:23.974
she had to cut off a
     big chunk of her hair.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.376
- I remember that summer,

27:25.411 --> 27:27.344
you had to wear
      bangs, didn't you?

27:27.380 --> 27:28.512
That was a bad look for you,

27:28.547 --> 27:29.713
you shouldn't do that anymore.

27:29.749 --> 27:30.748
- What?

27:30.783 --> 27:32.316
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.018
- Yeah.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.687
Yeah, it was.

27:36.722 --> 27:37.921
(soft music)

27:37.957 --> 27:38.856
- [Tom] Hey there.
      (door closes)

27:38.891 --> 27:40.257
You kids have fun yesterday?

27:40.292 --> 27:42.393
- (sighs) Sort of,
      but I didn't win,

27:42.428 --> 27:45.162
and we really could've used
the time to work on the recipe.

27:45.197 --> 27:48.332
- Well, you can't work
     yourself to the bone,

27:48.367 --> 27:50.401
you should be out
      enjoying yourself.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.702
- That's what I
      keep telling her.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.737
You should listen to
    your father, he's wise.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.339
- Okay, the contest
     is seven days away,

27:55.374 --> 27:58.342
I can consider having
     some fun after that.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.411
I might even take an
  entire day off. (chuckles)

28:00.446 --> 28:01.412
- You can make it a spa day.

28:01.447 --> 28:04.181
- Have I ever struck you
    as a spa-day kinda girl?

28:04.216 --> 28:08.218
- You are gonna at least
attend the festival activities,

28:08.254 --> 28:09.053
aren't you?

28:09.088 --> 28:11.288
You always love
      this time of year.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.956
- Maybe, but, (sighs)

28:12.992 --> 28:14.258
have you both forgotten

28:14.293 --> 28:16.393
that the future of the
     company is at risk?

28:16.429 --> 28:18.395
I promised Grandpa I was
  ready to take the reigns,

28:18.431 --> 28:20.030
and I can't let him down.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.434
- Whatever the outcome, we
 are all here to support you.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.404
(door opens)

28:27.440 --> 28:28.505
- Oh, hey, Mom.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.774
Heading out to the factory.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.244
- Your father is delighted

28:34.280 --> 28:36.313
at your dedication
      to the contest.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.414
- Well, I'm glad,

28:37.450 --> 28:39.550
it's time I learned more
  about the family business.

28:39.585 --> 28:41.618
- Well, you used to
     love to run around

28:41.654 --> 28:43.087
and play with the
      processing tools.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.388
(Jake chuckles)

28:44.423 --> 28:46.323
But once you
     started high school,

28:46.358 --> 28:49.326
you decided you didn't
     wanna come back here.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.629
- Yeah, well,
     that's why I'm back,

28:52.665 --> 28:54.264
to make up a bit
      of that lost time.

28:54.300 --> 28:57.234
- We like getting out here
  too, it's so peaceful.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.003
So, what's going on
     in San Francisco?

29:00.039 --> 29:01.238
- Well, you know.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.407
- (chuckles) You still seeing
 that woman you told me about?

29:03.442 --> 29:05.175
- Nah, it didn't work out.

29:05.211 --> 29:07.077
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.278
- It's all right,
      it's for the best,

29:08.314 --> 29:09.580
more time to focus on work.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.148
(phone chimes)

29:11.183 --> 29:12.716
Speaking of which,

29:14.520 --> 29:17.454
my firm is sending
     over a box of files.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.823
(soft music) If everything
  goes well with this case,

29:19.859 --> 29:22.025
I'll be on track
        to make partner.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.160
- That's great, Jake.

29:23.195 --> 29:23.994
- Yeah.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.563
- As long as it makes you happy.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.299
- Yeah.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.935
(Jake chuckles)

29:38.010 --> 29:39.710
(buzzer buzzes)

29:39.745 --> 29:42.312
(bell rings)

29:43.516 --> 29:45.649
- Everyone, this is
     my grandson, Jake,

29:45.684 --> 29:47.684
I'll be showing
      him around today.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.888
- Hello, everyone. (chuckles)

29:50.923 --> 29:52.523
- While I'm recovering,

29:52.558 --> 29:54.424
he'll be the front line
  for all things production.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.462
This is the centrifuge

29:58.497 --> 30:00.531
that extracts the
     oil from the olives.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.504
Bottling and labeling.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.976
Boxing and crating.

30:13.012 --> 30:15.813
Oh, don't worry, you'll
    get the hang of it.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.514
We all have to start somewhere.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.484
You've always said you
     wanted to learn this,

30:20.519 --> 30:23.253
I just wish I didn't
     have this busted wing

30:23.289 --> 30:24.521
so I could give
     you the real lesson

30:24.557 --> 30:26.223
on the traditional press.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.524
- There's so much
     more to this operation

30:27.560 --> 30:28.659
than I ever realized.

30:28.694 --> 30:30.527
- Yeah, it's a lotta hard work,

30:30.563 --> 30:31.728
but I've always enjoyed it.

30:31.764 --> 30:32.696
- I can see why.

30:33.732 --> 30:34.531
Thanks, Granddad.

30:35.467 --> 30:36.867
I should get back to my case.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.535
- Okay.

30:38.571 --> 30:41.572
(soft music)

30:41.607 --> 30:43.841
- [Adam] How's
      the tasting going?

30:43.876 --> 30:45.976
- Everyone seems to
     be having a nice time.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.445
- Hey, where'd this come from?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.080
- (sighs) I brought it
    in from the living room

30:50.115 --> 30:51.415
for a little motivation.

30:52.585 --> 30:53.617
- And what's this bottle here?

30:53.652 --> 30:55.552
- That is the Cabella Sunset,

30:55.588 --> 30:57.621
it was the very first
    recipe I helped develop.

30:57.656 --> 30:58.722
- Wow.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.290
I'd like to try that.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.625
- Unfortunately, it
     was a limited batch

31:01.660 --> 31:03.293
we made using the antique press.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.395
- Well, at least you still
 get to bust out the old girl

31:05.431 --> 31:06.730
for your small-batch lessons.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.101
- Yeah.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.212
(Nicole sighs)

31:24.516 --> 31:28.151
- I saw a bunch of people
  leaving here earlier.

31:28.187 --> 31:31.588
- I was hosting a tasting for
 a small group of tourists.

31:31.624 --> 31:33.757
But when my expansion
     plan goes through--

31:33.792 --> 31:34.558
- If.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.426
- When it goes through,

31:36.462 --> 31:38.462
it will allow for
     much larger groups.

31:39.832 --> 31:41.598
- So,

31:41.634 --> 31:42.399
why here?

31:44.637 --> 31:46.503
- It's my favorite place
    on the entire ranch,

31:46.538 --> 31:49.406
because it has the
     perfect sunset view.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.241
The only place that
     the Brandini factory

31:51.277 --> 31:52.509
doesn't get in the way.

31:52.544 --> 31:53.377
- So you're blaming
     me for that now?

31:53.412 --> 31:55.178
- I was just answering
     your question.

31:55.214 --> 31:56.046
- Mm.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.083
- Why do you care about
    this land so much?

32:00.119 --> 32:01.852
- I just wanna do what's
    right for my family,

32:01.887 --> 32:02.653
make them proud.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.454
- But you don't,

32:04.490 --> 32:05.322
you don't know anything
    (soft music)

32:05.357 --> 32:06.857
about oil production.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.458
- That may be,

32:08.494 --> 32:11.795
but every company needs strong
 leadership and management.

32:11.830 --> 32:12.796
That, I can do,

32:13.832 --> 32:15.432
with my business acumen.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.601
- Did you seriously just
  say acumen about yourself?

32:17.636 --> 32:18.502
(Nicole chuckles)

32:18.537 --> 32:20.470
- I have acumen to spare.

32:20.506 --> 32:24.041
- (chuckles) Okay.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.109
(Jake clears throat)

32:26.145 --> 32:29.479
- I do wish I'd had more
    hands-on experience.

32:29.515 --> 32:32.015
And I regret how little
  time I spent at the ranch

32:32.051 --> 32:32.983
since we were kids.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.989
You're right,
         (soft music)

32:39.024 --> 32:40.424
it is beautiful here.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.167
- Just...

32:50.202 --> 32:53.003
Okay, just promise me one thing,

32:53.038 --> 32:54.071
if you win--

32:54.106 --> 32:54.871
- When.

32:54.907 --> 32:56.239
- If. (chuckles)

32:56.275 --> 32:59.476
You make sure that
    nothing gets in the way

32:59.511 --> 33:00.544
of this perfect view.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.647
- I promise.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.753
(soft music)

33:09.788 --> 33:10.587
- Table 12.

33:13.459 --> 33:14.257
- Hey.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.360
- You stalking me?

33:16.395 --> 33:17.461
(Nicole chuckles)

33:17.496 --> 33:18.628
- Wow.

33:18.664 --> 33:19.730
Good morning to you too.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.666
I will have my usual, Billy.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.167
And just so you know,
    this is my go-to place,

33:24.203 --> 33:25.869
so who is stalking who?

33:25.904 --> 33:27.137
- (clears throat) Here you go.

33:27.172 --> 33:27.938
- Thank you.

33:27.973 --> 33:29.973
Everything okay?

33:30.009 --> 33:33.143
- Yeah, uh, two servers called
 in sick this morning, so...

33:33.178 --> 33:34.344
(Billy chuckles)

33:34.380 --> 33:35.679
- I can help out, it'll
    be like old times.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.314
- (sighs) Thank you.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.015
(Nicole chuckles)

33:38.050 --> 33:38.982
- [Jake] You used to work here?

33:39.018 --> 33:40.317
- During high school,

33:40.352 --> 33:41.651
she was the permanent
     employee of the month.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.187
- Oh, well, then I
     can lend a hand too.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.188
(Billy chuckles)

33:45.224 --> 33:46.556
- (chuckles) Oh.

33:46.592 --> 33:49.326
Wow, Jake Brandini
      doing hard labor.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.527
That I've gotta see.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.495
- You're on.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.665
- Uh, okay, let's
     get to work. (claps)

33:55.701 --> 33:56.767
Let's go.

34:01.874 --> 34:02.739
(Billy dings bell)

34:02.775 --> 34:04.174
Apple pie, order up!

34:04.209 --> 34:04.975
- That's for me.

34:05.010 --> 34:05.809
- That's mine.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.415
(Jake groans)

34:11.449 --> 34:12.282
Thank you.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.552
- Uh, I will go get
     you another one, sir.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.554
- Thank you for your patience,
 this is on the house.

34:18.590 --> 34:19.389
- Thank you, Nicole.

34:19.425 --> 34:20.190
(Nicole chuckles)

34:20.225 --> 34:21.058
- Unbelievable.

34:22.728 --> 34:26.530
Huh, a little greasing of the
 wheel never hurt, I suppose.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.199
- Are you accusing me
     of greasing the wheel?

34:29.234 --> 34:30.734
- Hey...

34:30.768 --> 34:33.203
(upbeat music)

34:33.237 --> 34:36.540
(Nicole chuckles)

34:36.574 --> 34:38.942
- I think we both
     know you deserve that.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.812
(Nicole chuckles)

34:43.782 --> 34:44.614
- Thank you.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.216
- [Billy] I will
     get you another one.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.551
- Great.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.053
(upbeat music)

34:55.793 --> 34:58.061
- Jake, what are you doing here?

34:59.665 --> 35:02.132
- Trying to increase
     the bitterness.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.035
Bitter is a positive, who knew?

35:05.070 --> 35:06.570
- Very good.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.771
Winning this year is
  more important than ever.

35:07.806 --> 35:08.472
- I know.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.574
Six days left to get it right.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.075
- It's also key we stay aware

35:12.111 --> 35:13.643
of what's happening
     in the industry.

35:13.679 --> 35:16.046
- You mean check
     out the competition?

35:16.081 --> 35:17.614
- In so many words.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.049
Just ensure we're
      leading trends,

35:19.084 --> 35:20.951
not falling behind on them.

35:23.021 --> 35:25.622
- Hmm.
         (upbeat music)

35:25.657 --> 35:27.457
- Welcome, everyone.

35:27.493 --> 35:30.127
Today, we'll be using the
 traditional olive oil press,

35:30.162 --> 35:31.495
and when we're done,

35:31.530 --> 35:34.131
you'll leave with your
     own, personal blend.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.432
(applause)

35:35.467 --> 35:36.800
- Apologies for my
     tardiness, everyone.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.435
- Uh--
    - Oh, please, continue.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.270
- No, I'm afraid
     we're fully booked.

35:40.305 --> 35:44.608
- I think I just snagged
    the last spot, online.

35:45.611 --> 35:48.745
- Everyone, please take
    your place at a station.

35:49.948 --> 35:52.516
No, you can't be here.

35:52.551 --> 35:53.817
- Why not? I'm a
        paying customer.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.820
Is there a problem with
    my confirmation email?

35:56.855 --> 35:57.954
- Okay, yep, fine, fine.

35:58.891 --> 35:59.923
- Thank you.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.994
(Nicole sighs)

36:04.029 --> 36:05.929
- The technique I'm
     about to teach you

36:05.964 --> 36:08.031
was developed by
     Cabella Oil's founder,

36:08.066 --> 36:09.799
and my grandpa, Frank.

36:09.835 --> 36:10.901
- Question.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.503
(Nicole clears throat)

36:13.539 --> 36:15.906
Don't you mean Raphael Brandini?

36:16.675 --> 36:18.041
- We're visiting
      Brandini tomorrow.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.943
- Oh, that, that
     won't be necessary.

36:19.978 --> 36:23.046
You're gonna learn everything
 you need right here.

36:23.081 --> 36:24.881
- I'm gonna post this,
     should I tag you?

36:24.917 --> 36:27.517
- Don't bother, Nicole
  doesn't have social media.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.052
She's old-school.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.287
- And how would you know?

36:30.322 --> 36:31.488
- Huh?

36:31.523 --> 36:33.990
Oh, um...

36:34.026 --> 36:36.826
- Making olive oil shouldn't
 be done by a formula.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.795
You have to follow
      your instincts.

36:48.674 --> 36:49.673
Look.

36:49.708 --> 36:50.874
See?

36:50.909 --> 36:51.975
It's perfect.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.611
Good job. (chuckles)

36:56.215 --> 36:58.248
That consistency is really nice.

36:58.283 --> 36:59.516
- Thank you.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.284
- (clears throat) How
     am I doing, teach?

37:18.604 --> 37:19.936
- You might wanna infuse
    more herbs for flavor,

37:19.972 --> 37:21.871
but it's...

37:21.907 --> 37:23.873
It's quite nice.

37:23.909 --> 37:24.708
You did a

37:26.044 --> 37:27.577
lovely job.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.379
- That was really hard
  for you to say, wasn't it?

37:29.414 --> 37:30.780
- It was, yeah.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.683
(Jake chuckles)

37:40.225 --> 37:42.125
You're here at a
      very scenic time,

37:42.160 --> 37:43.727
because tomorrow,

37:43.762 --> 37:46.396
all of the olives will actually
be harvested from the trees.

37:47.399 --> 37:48.765
- What are you building here?

37:50.168 --> 37:52.836
(upbeat music)

38:01.346 --> 38:03.947
- We are expanding. (chuckles)

38:03.982 --> 38:04.748
(knock at door)

38:04.783 --> 38:05.882
- Oh, hey, Granddad.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.485
Here, have a seat.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.686
- Listen,

38:09.721 --> 38:11.588
you and Maxwell need to stop
 treating me like an invalid.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.722
(Jake chuckles)

38:12.758 --> 38:15.258
You sure you don't need to
  get back to San Francisco?

38:15.294 --> 38:19.095
- Nope, I promised I'd stay
until I cleared out the dispute.

38:19.131 --> 38:19.796
- Ah.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.264
- And you are the one who says

38:21.300 --> 38:22.866
Brandinis always
        keep their word.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.802
- So where'd you get that?

38:25.837 --> 38:27.304
- Oh.

38:27.339 --> 38:28.138
It's, um...

38:29.341 --> 38:32.509
I took a class,
      at the Cabellas'.

38:32.544 --> 38:33.743
I figured that
      since you couldn't

38:33.779 --> 38:35.245
give me the lesson yourself,

38:35.280 --> 38:36.980
I would surprise you.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.649
So, surprise.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.951
- Spending some time
    with Nicole again, huh?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.620
Just like when you were kids.

38:43.655 --> 38:44.587
- You knew?

38:44.623 --> 38:45.655
- Of course I knew.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.824
You used to come back from
  your little adventures

38:47.859 --> 38:48.792
happy as a clam.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.093
I never told your father,

38:50.128 --> 38:51.661
because I knew he'd
     put a stop to it.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.029
- And you didn't mind?

38:53.065 --> 38:54.698
- No.

38:54.733 --> 38:57.033
I was glad you weren't burdened
by my conflict with Frank,

38:57.069 --> 38:59.069
it had nothing to do
     with you children.

38:59.871 --> 39:00.937
Try this.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.877
Oh, that's excellent.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.012
Mm.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.448
A nutty and very
      harmonious flavor.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.717
It actually reminds me
     of the original batch

39:13.752 --> 39:15.285
that Frank and I
     developed together.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.953
He must've taught Nicole well.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.621
- It was a lot of fun.

39:18.657 --> 39:20.990
But the Brandinis aren't
    exactly slacking off.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.525
- No, we aren't,

39:22.561 --> 39:25.395
but, uh, things sure aren't
 what they used to be.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.631
- Yeah, that factory does
 seem to follow some guidelines

39:28.667 --> 39:31.534
that are fairly strict with
their formulas and regulations--

39:31.570 --> 39:33.203
- That's it precisely.

39:33.238 --> 39:35.839
Manufacturing has
      become just too,

39:35.874 --> 39:38.041
I don't know, too manufactured.

39:38.076 --> 39:41.211
Back in my prime, I
  really got my hands dirty.

39:41.246 --> 39:42.145
- That reminds me.

39:43.915 --> 39:44.848
Look what I found.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.152
(Jake chuckles)

39:49.187 --> 39:50.520
- Wow.

39:51.456 --> 39:52.689
That takes me back.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.159
Oh, man, we had a
      lotta good times.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.295
I really miss those days.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.999
(Jake sighs)

40:03.034 --> 40:03.700
- [Adam] So what do you
  think of our latest batch?

40:03.735 --> 40:07.604
- Mm, it still lacks pizzazz.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.739
And we need to work
     on our overall design,

40:09.775 --> 40:13.109
the judges take the overall
 package into consideration.

40:13.145 --> 40:15.912
Brandini's is just so perfect.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.515
I mean, look at
      this presentation.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.718
- Yeah, but it's what's in the
 bottle that really matters.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.019
And Jake must be worried,

40:23.054 --> 40:24.287
I mean, he did take your class.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.889
- I know.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.691
I can't believe he had the
 audacity to look me up online.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.960
I mean, he must've
      been really bored.

40:30.996 --> 40:31.928
(upbeat music)
         - Uh,

40:31.963 --> 40:32.762
you logged into my account

40:32.798 --> 40:35.031
to look him up two
      days ago, so...

40:36.067 --> 40:38.868
- That, that was different,
that was for corporate research.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.881
(upbeat music)

40:57.823 --> 40:59.522
None of them are just right.

40:59.558 --> 41:00.590
- One, and two,
  - Two, three, four, five,

41:00.692 --> 41:02.292
- and three, and four, and...
 - six, seven, eight.

41:02.327 --> 41:03.393
It's an eight count.

41:03.428 --> 41:07.430
- No, it's one, and two,
  and three, and four, and.

41:07.466 --> 41:08.631
(Gloria sighs)

41:08.667 --> 41:09.766
How's the submission
     going, honey?

41:09.801 --> 41:12.335
- Um, well, we've narrowed
  it down to these options,

41:12.370 --> 41:13.870
but I... (sighs)

41:13.905 --> 41:15.772
I don't know which
      one to choose.

41:16.541 --> 41:20.043
Maybe you guys could
     tell me what you like.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.311
- Oh, sure.
         - Yeah.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.713
- Okay, um, the first
     one is more woody,

41:23.748 --> 41:26.316
and for this one, we
  incorporated floral hints.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.685
- Oh, my goodness me,
     that is fantastic.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.220
- I like the taste of that one,

41:30.255 --> 41:31.187
I can totally
         (upbeat music)

41:31.223 --> 41:32.021
serve that with food.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.123
- That is so robust.

41:34.159 --> 41:37.093
- I don't know, it
    really depends on how...

41:38.263 --> 41:40.630
- You know what,
     you are the expert,

41:40.665 --> 41:42.799
you will know which
     one to choose.

41:44.536 --> 41:45.735
- Yeah, I guess so.

41:45.770 --> 41:46.669
- Oh, yeah.
        - And remember,

41:46.705 --> 41:48.137
Grandpa will be home
     in a couple of days.

41:48.173 --> 41:49.839
- Right.
 - He wouldn't miss the contest

41:49.875 --> 41:50.573
for the world.

41:50.609 --> 41:51.808
- Right.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.076
We got dance class,
     (Gloria chuckles)

41:53.111 --> 41:56.179
so, it's salsa day.
     (Gloria chuckles)

41:56.214 --> 41:58.748
But listen, honey, you've
  got two winners there.

41:58.783 --> 42:00.717
They're both fantastic,
    you are killing it.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.385
Yeah?

42:02.420 --> 42:05.588
(upbeat music)

42:05.624 --> 42:06.723
(door closes)

42:06.758 --> 42:09.025
(Nicole sighs)

42:09.060 --> 42:11.194
(Nicole sighs)

42:11.229 --> 42:13.963
(Nicole sighs)

42:14.966 --> 42:18.568
- The rosemary infused in
 this batch made it unbalanced.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.905
And this is too strong.

42:22.908 --> 42:24.307
Back to the drawing board.

42:26.411 --> 42:29.445
- So if you guys start with
 that section over there,

42:29.481 --> 42:30.547
that'd be great.

42:30.582 --> 42:32.215
All right, you all know
  what to do, thanks, guys.

42:33.618 --> 42:34.918
Hey, um,

42:34.953 --> 42:36.452
I think we should use
     the olives from today

42:36.488 --> 42:37.587
in our next trial.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.590
- Okay, but as you know, they've
been on the trees longer,

42:40.625 --> 42:42.692
so they will have a different...

42:42.727 --> 42:44.861
(Adam clears throat)

42:44.896 --> 42:45.728
- Good morning.

42:45.764 --> 42:46.696
- Hi.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.598
- What, what brings you by?

42:48.633 --> 42:52.235
- I was, uh, wondering if I
could help out with the harvest?

42:52.270 --> 42:53.169
- Seriously?

42:54.005 --> 42:55.638
Why here?

42:55.674 --> 42:56.639
- Well, the Brandinis,

42:56.675 --> 42:59.742
we use industrial
  machines for the harvest,

42:59.778 --> 43:02.645
you guys do it the
old-fashioned way, the true way.

43:02.681 --> 43:04.480
- Still, I don't
     think it's a good idea

43:04.516 --> 43:05.682
for you to be out here.

43:05.784 --> 43:07.617
- Well, you said yourself I
 should try a day in the field.

43:07.652 --> 43:08.885
(upbeat music)

43:08.920 --> 43:09.919
Challenge accepted.

43:11.122 --> 43:14.824
Besides, I went into town
 and rustled up proper attire.

43:14.859 --> 43:16.025
(Adam scoffs)

43:16.061 --> 43:18.394
- Those boots are so pristine,
 you could be in a catalog.

43:18.430 --> 43:19.662
- Oh, be nice,

43:19.698 --> 43:22.765
I think he looks sharp,
    almost authentic even.

43:22.801 --> 43:23.933
- Thank you, Adam.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.769
So, what do you say?

43:26.805 --> 43:27.604
Can I stay?

43:32.310 --> 43:33.076
(Nicole sighs)

43:33.111 --> 43:34.310
- You promise to behave?

43:36.147 --> 43:37.280
(sighs) Alrighty then.

43:38.383 --> 43:39.449
You can shadow me.

43:40.685 --> 43:41.484
- Yes!

43:43.021 --> 43:45.655
Are you suggesting I
     have delicate hands.

43:46.891 --> 43:48.291
- Oh, come on, don't
     be so sensitive.

43:48.326 --> 43:50.293
See, we all wear gloves.

43:50.328 --> 43:51.260
- Okay then.

43:51.296 --> 43:52.795
Thank you.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.931
Oh, uh, before we get started,

43:54.966 --> 43:57.767
found something I think
  you'll get a kick out of.

43:57.802 --> 43:58.935
Look at that.

44:00.672 --> 44:01.838
- Wow.

44:01.873 --> 44:03.640
You know, I forgot there was
 a time when our grandfathers

44:03.675 --> 44:05.842
actually used to work
     the land together.

44:05.877 --> 44:06.709
- Pretty cool, huh?

44:06.745 --> 44:07.677
- Yeah.

44:08.513 --> 44:09.679
I'll, um,

44:09.714 --> 44:12.148
I'll show this to my grandpa
 when he gets back into town,

44:12.183 --> 44:13.850
I'm sure he'll love it.

44:13.885 --> 44:14.951
- Sounds good.

44:16.021 --> 44:20.356
All right, let's get these
  protective gloves on.

44:20.392 --> 44:22.992
(Nicole scoffs)

44:32.671 --> 44:34.003
(Nicole clears throat)

44:34.039 --> 44:35.471
What do you think?

44:35.507 --> 44:38.041
Am I a natural in
     the making or what?

44:38.076 --> 44:38.875
- Not exactly.

44:39.811 --> 44:41.644
Here, okay, I'll show
     you how it's done.

44:41.680 --> 44:45.415
If you take the branch like
 this, and then go like that,

44:45.450 --> 44:47.350
you actually get it
     done a lot faster.

44:51.523 --> 44:52.922
- Thanks. (clears throat)

44:52.957 --> 44:54.490
- Yeah, you take that tree.

44:54.526 --> 44:55.925
- Got it.
  - Um, I will be over here.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.728
- You get that one.
     - Yeah.

44:58.763 --> 44:59.562
- Great.

45:13.912 --> 45:15.845
- How'd you do?

45:15.880 --> 45:17.780
- It went pretty
      good, almost full.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.615
Whoa, you really are a pro.

45:19.651 --> 45:20.416
(Nicole chuckles)

45:20.452 --> 45:22.085
- Yeah, well, you know,

45:22.120 --> 45:25.054
running a ranch is so much
 more than just picking olives.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.122
I have to get better
     at managing the books.

45:26.257 --> 45:29.892
You know, I'm trying to
 improve my business acumen.

45:29.928 --> 45:32.028
- Well, the guys at the ranch,
 they have a program for that,

45:32.063 --> 45:33.463
I can send it to you.

45:33.498 --> 45:34.363
- Really?

45:34.399 --> 45:35.698
- Yeah, done.

45:35.734 --> 45:36.733
- Thank you.

45:36.768 --> 45:37.700
- Thanks for today.

45:38.937 --> 45:40.036
You're a pretty good teacher.

45:40.071 --> 45:43.639
- Well, you turned out to
  be a pretty good student.

45:43.675 --> 45:45.775
Quite helpful, so, well done.

45:45.810 --> 45:47.810
- Oh, don't go soft on me,
  I won't know how to react.

45:47.846 --> 45:48.945
- Okay. (chuckles)

45:49.080 --> 45:51.881
- Oh, ow, okay, that's more
 like the Nicole I remember.

45:51.916 --> 45:52.949
(both chuckle)

45:52.984 --> 45:55.251
- So, staying on the ranch
  must be way different

45:55.286 --> 45:57.220
from what you're used
     to in San Francisco?

45:57.255 --> 45:57.920
- You have no idea.

45:57.956 --> 45:59.455
Do you ever get out that way?

45:59.491 --> 46:01.324
- Yeah, yeah, I drive
     out pretty often,

46:01.359 --> 46:03.459
I go to a lot of Giants games.
 - Really?

46:03.495 --> 46:06.129
Well, my firm, we
     get season tickets.

46:06.164 --> 46:07.964
I should take you
     to a game one time.

46:08.967 --> 46:11.167
You and, you and Adam.

46:11.202 --> 46:12.969
- That would be amazing.

46:13.004 --> 46:14.270
- Yeah.

46:14.305 --> 46:15.972
- Okay, um,

46:16.007 --> 46:17.273
you know, I should get
 these cleaned and processed

46:17.308 --> 46:18.241
before they turn.

46:18.276 --> 46:19.809
- (exhales) You're a machine.

46:19.844 --> 46:21.577
I gotta rest up
      for the big race.

46:21.613 --> 46:23.012
- Wait, you're doing
     the Cornucopia 500?

46:23.047 --> 46:23.913
(upbeat music)

46:23.948 --> 46:24.914
- You know it.

46:24.949 --> 46:26.349
- See you at the finish line.

46:26.384 --> 46:28.518
- If you're lucky.
      (Nicole chuckles)

46:28.553 --> 46:29.552
Challenge accepted.

46:31.189 --> 46:32.822
- Uh, keep 'em, for next time.

46:35.126 --> 46:37.860
- Ladies and gentlemen,
    boys and girls,

46:37.896 --> 46:40.963
welcome to the Cornucopia 500!

46:40.999 --> 46:43.132
(cheering and applause)

46:43.168 --> 46:47.503
Racers, no bumping, pushing,
 grabbing, or shoving.

46:47.539 --> 46:48.437
- [Jake] You taking notes?

46:48.473 --> 46:49.372
- (sighs) Always.

46:49.407 --> 46:51.073
- [Billy] We want a clean race.

46:52.210 --> 46:53.109
(Nicole sighs)

46:53.144 --> 46:54.010
(upbeat music)
         - Hey.

46:54.045 --> 46:55.311
- Three laps for the win.

46:56.915 --> 46:59.115
Racers, start your engines.

47:01.686 --> 47:03.319
On your marks,

47:04.722 --> 47:05.521
get set,

47:09.694 --> 47:11.294
go!
    (cheering and applause)

47:11.329 --> 47:15.131
- No! (groans)

47:15.166 --> 47:16.666
- (chuckles) Eat my dust.

47:18.703 --> 47:19.836
You're never gonna catch me,

47:19.871 --> 47:22.371
no, no, no.
     - (chuckles) Oh, yeah?

47:22.407 --> 47:23.206
- Woo!

47:24.943 --> 47:26.642
Yeah. (chuckles)

47:26.678 --> 47:28.244
You're not gonna win.

47:28.279 --> 47:29.579
No!

47:29.614 --> 47:31.047
(Jake chuckles)

47:31.082 --> 47:33.249
How does my dust taste, huh?

47:33.284 --> 47:36.719
(cheering and applause)

47:40.625 --> 47:43.092
- [Billy] Jake is in the lead.

47:43.127 --> 47:44.527
Oh, Nicole's creeping up.

47:45.430 --> 47:47.530
This is a close one.

47:48.600 --> 47:49.699
One lap to go.

47:51.236 --> 47:53.302
Racers, it's your final lap.

47:54.138 --> 47:55.204
- Woo!

47:57.942 --> 48:00.109
No way. (Nicole chuckles)

48:00.144 --> 48:01.844
Good try, but not gonna happen.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.579
- [Billy] Coming
     around the bend now.

48:03.615 --> 48:05.548
- (chuckles) No, no,
     what are you doing?

48:05.583 --> 48:06.949
- [Billy] Up to the finish line.

48:06.985 --> 48:08.251
- What are you doing? No!

48:08.286 --> 48:09.252
No way!

48:09.287 --> 48:11.187
(cheering and applause)

48:11.222 --> 48:12.922
That is not fair!

48:12.957 --> 48:15.057
Hey, no fair, he
      said no grabbing,

48:15.093 --> 48:16.058
you totally broke the rules.

48:16.094 --> 48:18.194
- (chuckles) You and your rules.

48:18.229 --> 48:20.263
- Hey, congratulations.

48:20.298 --> 48:21.864
- Oh, thank you. (chuckles)

48:21.900 --> 48:23.199
- Everybody's gonna
     go for drinks later.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.533
- Yeah, you wanna come?

48:24.569 --> 48:27.270
- Um, you know, I'm
    gonna sit this one out.

48:27.305 --> 48:28.571
You guys have fun.

48:28.606 --> 48:30.406
Uh, congrats. (chuckles)

48:30.441 --> 48:35.444
- [Nicole] Okay, thanks.
    (soft music)

48:36.180 --> 48:38.814
(Nicole sighs)

48:38.850 --> 48:40.016
(soft music)

48:40.051 --> 48:41.317
- [Adam] Check this out.

48:43.288 --> 48:44.120
- Wow.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.356
You know what?

48:47.392 --> 48:48.291
I think I love it.

48:50.228 --> 48:53.229
But, you know, the contest,
 it's only four days away,

48:53.264 --> 48:55.998
and we aren't gonna win just
because of an interesting font.

48:56.034 --> 48:57.333
- Well, we aren't going to lose,

48:57.368 --> 48:59.502
you keep saying that
     this is our year.

48:59.537 --> 49:01.337
- I know.

49:01.372 --> 49:03.606
But it is, it's more
     than just a contest,

49:03.641 --> 49:05.741
it's the company's
      future at stake.

49:05.777 --> 49:08.411
- Right, so let's get
     back to work, champ.

49:09.547 --> 49:10.279
- Champ.

49:10.315 --> 49:12.348
(both chuckle)

49:12.383 --> 49:13.115
Yeah.

49:13.151 --> 49:15.685
(upbeat music)

49:16.454 --> 49:19.188
- Oh. (groans)

49:19.223 --> 49:21.424
That's gonna leave a mark.

49:24.562 --> 49:27.430
Hey. (chuckles)

49:27.465 --> 49:28.798
Yeah.

49:28.833 --> 49:30.266
It's good timing, really.

49:30.301 --> 49:32.134
(Nicole chuckles)

49:32.170 --> 49:33.269
It seems, um,

49:33.371 --> 49:36.305
my bike had different ideas
 about me fixing its chain.

49:36.341 --> 49:38.474
- Well, you have to approach
 a bike with determination,

49:38.509 --> 49:40.643
otherwise, why would it
    let you climb aboard?

49:40.678 --> 49:43.145
- You know, you may have
    been a better cyclist,

49:43.181 --> 49:44.447
I mean, back in the day,

49:44.482 --> 49:46.615
but even I know
      you're mocking me.

49:46.651 --> 49:47.450
- I am.

49:49.153 --> 49:51.887
But maybe I can, I can
     show you what to do.

49:51.923 --> 49:52.688
- Be my guest.

49:56.427 --> 49:59.962
- So, you just attach
     the chain here,

49:59.998 --> 50:03.632
and once it's hooked, pull it
 through, and you're all set.

50:03.668 --> 50:04.767
There's nothing to it.

50:04.802 --> 50:06.302
For me, at least.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.004
(Jake chuckles)

50:08.039 --> 50:09.405
Your steed awaits.

50:10.208 --> 50:11.640
- Much obliged.

50:11.676 --> 50:14.276
(Nicole sighs)

50:14.312 --> 50:17.380
You, uh, do you wanna join me?

50:19.984 --> 50:23.552
I could, uh, we could
    go around the bike path.

50:25.023 --> 50:26.122
- The bike path?

50:26.224 --> 50:29.692
- (chuckles) Yeah, the, uh,
 famous Brandini bike path.

50:29.727 --> 50:31.293
(both chuckle)

50:31.329 --> 50:33.796
I could, uh, I could
  show you around our side.

50:35.366 --> 50:36.232
- You know, in all these years,

50:36.334 --> 50:38.334
I've never properly
     visited Brandini's.

50:40.171 --> 50:44.040
I'll admit, I've been
     curious. (chuckles)

50:44.075 --> 50:45.374
- Well, you let me
      join your class,

50:45.410 --> 50:47.610
the least I can do
     is give you a tour.

50:48.846 --> 50:49.578
- Okay.

50:51.582 --> 50:54.350
(both chuckle)

50:56.854 --> 50:58.220
- Nicole is so stressed.

50:58.256 --> 50:59.522
- Yeah, Jake is too.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.457
He won't admit it,
      but I can tell.

51:01.492 --> 51:03.692
- (chuckles) Yeah, those two.

51:03.728 --> 51:04.994
You see the way they
     look at each other?

51:05.029 --> 51:07.630
- Oh, yeah. (chuckles)

51:07.665 --> 51:09.498
It's so obvious.

51:09.534 --> 51:12.001
- Yeah.

51:12.036 --> 51:14.203
Yeah, I, uh, I better
     get back to the ranch.

51:17.041 --> 51:18.474
- Are you, uh, (clears throat)

51:18.509 --> 51:19.842
going to the concert
     tomorrow night?

51:19.877 --> 51:20.976
- Yeah, you bet I am.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.479
- [Billy] I'll see you there.

51:23.514 --> 51:24.413
- Thank you.

51:24.449 --> 51:25.614
- Yeah, take care.

51:28.686 --> 51:30.186
- Come on,
         (soft music)

51:30.221 --> 51:32.555
there's no way you could prefer
pizza over a steak dinner.

51:32.590 --> 51:35.357
You haven't lived until
 you've tried my Chateaubriand.

51:35.393 --> 51:37.026
- Is that like a cheese steak?

51:37.061 --> 51:39.328
- (chuckles) All right,
  you know what, I give up.

51:39.363 --> 51:40.729
- Well, maybe you can
    make it for me sometime

51:40.765 --> 51:42.398
and show me what I'm missing.

51:42.433 --> 51:45.000
- Okay, fine, as long as you
 bring the bread and olive oil.

51:49.574 --> 51:50.773
- Hey, um,

51:50.808 --> 51:53.209
how is your submission for the
 contest coming along anyway?

51:53.244 --> 51:55.911
- Uh, pretty good, I think.

51:55.947 --> 51:58.781
We've been working really
  hard, I learned a lot.

51:58.816 --> 51:59.648
How about you?

52:00.785 --> 52:03.018
- Oh, it's, uh,
     it's a masterpiece.

52:03.054 --> 52:05.654
(Jake chuckles)

52:07.125 --> 52:10.126
- Do you ever wonder what
  it would've been like

52:10.161 --> 52:13.829
if your granddad hadn't walked
 away from the partnership?

52:14.632 --> 52:15.531
- Walked away?

52:16.767 --> 52:19.368
That is not how I
      would describe it.

52:19.403 --> 52:20.069
- What?

52:20.104 --> 52:21.604
- Raphael went behind his back

52:21.639 --> 52:22.505
and started making
      deals without him,

52:22.607 --> 52:24.607
how else should my
     grandpa have reacted?

52:24.642 --> 52:26.475
- Wait, that's what Frank says?

52:26.511 --> 52:28.477
According to my granddad,

52:28.513 --> 52:29.812
Frank wouldn't listen to reason

52:29.847 --> 52:31.881
about expanding the
     business, together.

52:33.751 --> 52:34.984
(Jake chuckles)

52:35.019 --> 52:36.485
- No wonder you think
     such terrible things

52:36.521 --> 52:37.586
about me and my family.

52:38.856 --> 52:40.556
- What do you mean?

52:40.591 --> 52:42.057
No, I don't.

52:42.093 --> 52:43.626
- I heard you.

52:43.661 --> 52:45.461
The last summer you spent here,

52:45.496 --> 52:47.563
I was waiting for
      you by the border.

52:47.598 --> 52:48.430
- And?

52:48.566 --> 52:51.400
- And you were with
     your dad, so I hid.

52:51.435 --> 52:52.735
I didn't want you
      getting in trouble

52:52.770 --> 52:54.036
for hanging out with me.

52:55.439 --> 52:57.173
And that's when I
     heard you complaining

52:57.208 --> 52:58.641
about how annoying I was.

53:00.211 --> 53:02.678
- That doesn't sound right,
 what specifically did I say?

53:02.713 --> 53:05.080
- That you couldn't
     stand being around me,

53:05.116 --> 53:06.549
and you were very firm.

53:08.386 --> 53:09.451
(Jake chuckles)

53:09.487 --> 53:10.986
- I think you misunderstood.

53:12.156 --> 53:13.889
I was talking about
     my summer tutor.

53:15.126 --> 53:16.192
- Are you sure?

53:16.227 --> 53:17.459
- Definitely.

53:17.495 --> 53:18.627
She was always giving
     me extra homework.

53:18.663 --> 53:20.629
I mean, who does
     that? That's cruel.

53:20.665 --> 53:21.864
- (chuckles) Yeah, it is.

53:21.899 --> 53:23.666
(Jake chuckles)
        (soft music)

53:23.701 --> 53:27.336
- I never woulda said that
  about you, or your family.

53:28.506 --> 53:29.572
- Oh.

53:31.375 --> 53:35.344
After all this time, I can't
 believe I had it wrong.

53:35.379 --> 53:37.780
- And that's why you
  stopped coming to meet me.

53:40.151 --> 53:42.585
I never understood what I
  did to make you so upset.

53:47.658 --> 53:48.791
- [Raphael] Jake.

53:48.826 --> 53:51.694
- Oh, we've been spotted.

53:51.729 --> 53:52.695
Hey, Granddad.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.496
- Nice to see you, Mr. Brandini.

53:54.532 --> 53:56.065
- Oh, hello, Nicole.

53:56.100 --> 53:58.334
- This is incredible.

53:58.369 --> 54:00.703
- Oh, personally, I think
 it's a little ostentatious,

54:00.738 --> 54:03.205
but my son said it would
    be good for the brand.

54:03.241 --> 54:05.507
- Jake was just telling me
 about all the gourmet meals

54:05.543 --> 54:06.709
he likes to prepare.

54:06.744 --> 54:09.311
- Oh, so you've
     upgraded from takeout?

54:09.347 --> 54:10.412
(Nicole chuckles)
      - Uh, okay,

54:10.448 --> 54:13.816
so I don't have time to
  wile away in the kitchen,

54:13.851 --> 54:17.419
but I can actually make
    a few signature dishes.

54:17.455 --> 54:18.287
- Mm.

54:19.423 --> 54:21.056
(chuckles) And I was gonna
  bring you some of my oil.

54:21.092 --> 54:22.925
(Jake and Nicole chuckle)

54:22.960 --> 54:24.760
- Uh, speaking of your oil,

54:24.795 --> 54:27.696
I sampled some of the batch
 that Jake made in your class,

54:27.732 --> 54:28.931
you really know
      what you're doing.

54:28.966 --> 54:30.499
- Well, I learned from the best.

54:30.534 --> 54:31.333
- That you did.

54:31.369 --> 54:33.402
Frank should be
      very proud of you,

54:33.437 --> 54:35.337
you definitely
     inherited his gift.

54:36.807 --> 54:39.341
- That is, that's very
     kind of you to say.

54:39.377 --> 54:40.175
- It's true.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.746
- And on that note, I
 should get back to my work.

54:43.781 --> 54:46.749
- Yeah, me too, got
     a competition to win.

54:46.784 --> 54:47.883
- Yeah, you sure about that?
 (upbeat music)

54:47.918 --> 54:49.918
- Yeah, speaking
        of competitions,

54:50.988 --> 54:53.689
race you to the post.

54:53.724 --> 54:54.923
- All right, you're on.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.191
See you later.

54:56.227 --> 54:57.393
- You're not gonna
      beat me today.

54:57.428 --> 54:58.394
Not again.

54:58.429 --> 55:00.195
No, no, no, get back here.

55:00.231 --> 55:02.398
This is not fair!
      (Nicole chuckles)

55:02.433 --> 55:07.436
(buzzer buzzes)
        (bell rings)

55:08.506 --> 55:12.608
Mm-hmm, this one incorporates
 the lemon flavor.

55:13.411 --> 55:15.210
Mm, it isn't half bad.

55:16.147 --> 55:18.080
Guess I might be a real
    Brandini after all.

55:19.784 --> 55:22.051
(soft music)

55:27.525 --> 55:30.125
- (sighs) Okay.

55:35.766 --> 55:37.599
(sighs)

55:37.635 --> 55:38.867
- Adam, how's it going?

55:40.004 --> 55:43.806
- I think we're getting
 there, it's going pretty good.

55:43.841 --> 55:46.775
(Eleanor chuckles)

55:47.812 --> 55:49.978
- Oh, well, look who it
  is, the famous Brandinis.

55:51.515 --> 55:53.349
- Are you enjoying the festival?

55:53.384 --> 55:54.416
I, for one, am looking forward

55:54.518 --> 55:58.721
to finally putting our
 reclaimed land to good use.

56:00.691 --> 56:01.790
- What are, what are
     you trying to say?

56:01.826 --> 56:03.325
- I think, um, (clears throat)

56:03.361 --> 56:04.827
what he meant to say is that

56:04.862 --> 56:08.430
the Cabellas have
     untapped potential.

56:08.466 --> 56:09.665
- Unlike Brandini's,

56:09.700 --> 56:11.100
Cabella's not all
     about the bottom line.

56:11.135 --> 56:13.502
- Well, perhaps that's
     part of the problem.

56:13.537 --> 56:14.837
- Well, I just wanted to say

56:14.872 --> 56:17.139
I was very impressed by
    your accounting program.

56:19.377 --> 56:20.909
- You showed her our system?

56:22.680 --> 56:24.113
- It's just an accounting tool.

56:25.583 --> 56:27.049
- Let's go.

56:27.084 --> 56:28.183
We'll see you at the contest.

56:28.219 --> 56:30.786
(soft music)

56:34.525 --> 56:35.324
- It's okay.

56:38.829 --> 56:41.530
(Nicole sighs)

56:43.467 --> 56:45.667
(phone chimes)

56:45.703 --> 56:48.270
(soft music)

56:48.305 --> 56:51.039
(Nicole chuckles)

56:52.676 --> 56:54.243
- Have you forgotten
     that this contest

56:54.278 --> 56:56.245
determines Cabella's
     entire future?

56:57.181 --> 56:58.447
- What?

56:58.482 --> 57:00.182
No, of course not.

57:00.217 --> 57:01.817
- All I'm saying is you're
  starting to act like

57:01.852 --> 57:03.285
he's no longer the villain.

57:04.855 --> 57:05.988
- All I'm saying is

57:06.957 --> 57:10.325
maybe he isn't as bad
    as I originally thought.

57:11.562 --> 57:12.795
Hey, Adam?

57:12.830 --> 57:13.929
- Yes?

57:13.964 --> 57:14.997
- I was thinking

57:15.099 --> 57:18.133
maybe we should submit
 something more traditional.

57:18.169 --> 57:19.468
- You can't be serious?

57:19.503 --> 57:20.702
We finally tweaked the recipe

57:20.738 --> 57:21.970
and now you wanna
     start all over again?

57:22.006 --> 57:24.006
- I don't know, it
     could be interesting.

57:24.975 --> 57:27.943
- If you wanna wow the
 judges and compete with Jake,

57:27.978 --> 57:30.279
we're gonna need to present
 something with a modern edge.

57:30.314 --> 57:33.148
- Yes, yes, yes, you're right.

57:33.184 --> 57:34.550
Just forget I said anything,

57:34.618 --> 57:37.085
let's finalize the
      recipe we have.

57:38.856 --> 57:40.322
- I think

57:40.357 --> 57:41.824
(upbeat music)

57:41.859 --> 57:43.158
that's it.

57:43.194 --> 57:44.126
Great job, guys.

57:49.033 --> 57:50.332
- Everything all right?

57:50.367 --> 57:51.867
- I don't know, you tell me.

57:55.773 --> 57:56.605
- Mm.

58:04.615 --> 58:06.215
- What do you think?

58:07.685 --> 58:10.786
- It's our signature flavor
 with a hint of lemon.

58:11.455 --> 58:13.188
Is that pepper I'm detecting?

58:13.224 --> 58:15.657
- Your senses do not
     deceive you, Granddad.

58:15.693 --> 58:16.758
You still got it.

58:16.794 --> 58:18.160
- We could win with this.

58:20.264 --> 58:22.698
- But, uh, is winning
     really everything?

58:24.068 --> 58:25.601
- Well, what do you mean?

58:25.636 --> 58:27.202
- I don't know,

58:27.238 --> 58:29.271
what about discovering what
 really makes you happy?

58:29.306 --> 58:31.073
Didn't you say you
    miss the good old days,

58:31.108 --> 58:33.308
when you and Frank
    first started the ranch?

58:34.245 --> 58:35.210
- Yeah.

58:35.346 --> 58:37.145
- You ever consider
 (soft music) making amends?

58:39.283 --> 58:40.916
- He's not interested in that.

58:42.453 --> 58:43.352
- You sure?

58:48.792 --> 58:51.226
- Honeys, I'm home. (chuckles)

58:51.262 --> 58:52.361
(Nicole gasps)

58:52.396 --> 58:53.562
- Grandpa!

58:53.597 --> 58:56.798
You're back, hey! (chuckles)

58:56.834 --> 59:01.803
Hey. (chuckles)

59:01.839 --> 59:03.105
- How was the trip, Frank?

59:03.140 --> 59:05.307
- Ah, plenty of time
     to recap all of that,

59:05.342 --> 59:07.776
tell me what's been going on
 with this border situation.

59:07.811 --> 59:10.612
- Uh, we will know
      in a couple days.

59:10.648 --> 59:12.581
- I'd give anything
     to show that Raphael

59:12.616 --> 59:14.216
who the real talent is.

59:14.251 --> 59:16.285
- He's actually been
     really sweet to me.

59:16.320 --> 59:19.621
Jake has been quite reasonable
 about everything too.

59:19.657 --> 59:21.223
- What?

59:21.258 --> 59:23.492
Did I come home to an
     alternate universe?

59:23.527 --> 59:25.394
- I'm serious, Grandpa.
    (soft music)

59:25.429 --> 59:27.729
Have you ever properly
     sat down with Raphael

59:27.765 --> 59:29.464
to hear his side of the story?

59:29.500 --> 59:31.967
- Now why on earth
      would he do that?

59:32.002 --> 59:33.769
- I'm afraid, my dear,

59:33.804 --> 59:36.405
Raphael and I have nothing
  to say to each other.

59:36.440 --> 59:40.776
- I just think it's possible
 we've misconstrued things.

59:40.811 --> 59:42.210
- What are you suggesting?

59:43.447 --> 59:45.647
- That the Brandinis
     might not be so bad.

59:51.655 --> 59:54.289
(phone rings)

59:56.493 --> 59:57.392
- Hey, Julie.

59:58.862 --> 01:00:01.096
Yeah, I've had a good visit,
 but I'll be back Monday.

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:03.231
Listen,

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.500
have you considered
     offering a settlement

01:00:05.536 --> 01:00:06.435
on the copyright case?

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:10.505
I understand.

01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:11.607
Full steam ahead.

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:27.489
(Billy chuckles)

01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:32.361
Hi, thank you.

01:00:39.103 --> 01:00:39.868
- How you doing?

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:41.303
Good to see you.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.039
- Hey, Nicole, there you are.

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:45.407
- Hey. (chuckles)

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:47.376
Oh, I'll just take
    one, please, thank you.

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:50.846
- Oh, ladies first.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:52.180
I'll take the next one.

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:53.882
- You sure?

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:55.751
- Yeah, it's fine.

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:56.618
- Okay.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:00.322
- Don't be absurd.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:01.089
- What?

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:01.890
- Yeah, plenty of room.

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:02.691
- What's going on?

01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:03.659
Whoa, okay. (chuckles)

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:05.827
Thank you, thank you for that.

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:13.101
(soft music)

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:14.503
It sure is beautiful out.

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:17.773
- Hm, Sunset Valley
     has its moments.

01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:20.542
- It sure does.
      (Nicole chuckles)

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:21.910
- You excited to go home?

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:28.350
- Yeah, it'll be nice to go
 back to the grind, I guess.

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:32.754
- Is there, is there
    someone to get back to?

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:33.555
- Nah.

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:36.892
To be completely honest,

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:40.529
I'm spending so much
     time with my clients,

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:43.432
I really haven't had
     time for anyone else.

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:44.366
How about yourself?

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:49.971
- Pretty focused on my
     career too. (chuckles)

01:01:50.007 --> 01:01:50.772
- You're lucky.

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:54.810
You've always known
     what you wanted to do.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:59.214
- Yeah, always, running Cabella
Oil, just like my Grandpa.

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:00.916
- And it happened.

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:03.385
You are boss lady.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.188
- (chuckles) Yeah, for the
  next few days at least.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:08.690
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:11.493
- Have you already forgotten
 about our little wager?

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:16.565
- No, but, I mean, even
    if I win, you know,

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:18.366
you can always expand on a
 different part of the ranch,

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:19.534
right?

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.105
- We'd have to
     build from scratch,

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.641
and we don't have
      the capital, so...

01:02:26.677 --> 01:02:28.777
- Why didn't you say anything?

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:31.079
- (sighs) Come on, would
  it have made a difference?

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:35.150
Plus, I wanna win or
     lose, fair and square.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.723
(upbeat music)

01:02:53.504 --> 01:02:56.204
Um, I'm gonna go get us
    all a drink at the bar,

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.340
uh, Adam, you wanna come?

01:02:58.375 --> 01:02:59.508
- You got it.

01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:03.211
- (chuckles) Sorry.

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:06.214
- It's okay to
     like her, you know?

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:07.015
- Nicole?

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.317
I do like her.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:11.620
- I mean, like her like her.

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:15.123
- But she's dating Adam.

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.792
- [Billy] She's not dating Adam.

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:19.394
- Jake.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:20.629
- Oh, hey, Granddad.

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:21.963
- Come on, let's go find a seat.

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:22.798
- Yeah.

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:26.735
- Here, right here.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:27.869
- Okay, cool.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:39.147
- Uh...
  - Hey there, how are you?

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:39.915
- How are you?

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.716
- Doing good.

01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:43.218
- Hi.

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:44.052
- Hey.

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:49.057
- Um, you know what, uh, can
you, can you give this to Jake?

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:50.759
I should sit with my parents.

01:03:50.794 --> 01:03:51.726
- Yeah, no problem.

01:03:51.762 --> 01:03:52.661
- Got it?
          - Yeah.

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:56.531
- Thanks.

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:57.632
- Thanks.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:12.681
(applause)

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:16.685
- Thank you, thank
      you, thank you.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.554
All right, we're gonna slow
 things down a little bit now.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:24.492
(soft music)

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:34.970
- I think they're
      playing our song.

01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:37.839
(Nicole chuckles)

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:48.550
- Ask the girl to dance already.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:04.099
- May I have this dance, Nicole?

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:07.102
- I'm a, I'm a really bad
  dancer, two left feet.

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:10.705
- That's perfect, I
     have two right feet.

01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:22.150
It's really easy, okay?

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:22.851
- Okay.

01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:24.619
- Give me your hand, right here.

01:05:24.655 --> 01:05:25.754
- Okay.

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.822
- And this hand goes out.

01:05:27.858 --> 01:05:29.824
- Nice, wow. (chuckles)

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.659
- Look at me.

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:43.505
- Yeah. (chuckles)

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:46.808
(Nicole chuckles)

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:55.583
Oh. (chuckles)

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.836
(soft music)

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:37.258
(pulls on drawer)

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:39.794
(soft music)

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:08.423
- Well, that was
      quite the evening.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:09.657
- Yes.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:10.592
Yeah, it was nice.

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:13.428
- I'm sorry,

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:15.296
are you calling the dance that
 you shared with Jake nice?

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:19.667
- One song, there's
  nothing to it. (chuckles)

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:23.671
- Nicole, come on, it's me,
 you don't have to pretend.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.473
I know there's something
 going on between you and Jake,

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:26.274
just admit it.

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:27.509
- Look,

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.178
I mean, I am glad we cleared
 the air after all these years,

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.012
that's all.

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:33.148
(soft music)
         Oh, besides,

01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.716
come on, he lives
      in San Francisco.

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:36.918
- San Francisco's
      only a drive away.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.624
(upbeat music)

01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:44.793
- You won't believe it.

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.394
- What's gotten into you, son?

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.662
- You have to look at the
  documents I just found.

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:49.264
It could make all
      the difference.

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:56.404
- Stop pestering me, (chuckles)

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.272
and let's get back
     to the task at hand.

01:07:57.307 --> 01:08:00.141
Tomorrow is judgment
     day, literally.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.509
- Fine, I'll pester you later.

01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:03.311
- (chuckles) Okay, good luck.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:05.713
I'll be going into town
  to run some errands later.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.483
- What's this?

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:09.884
Our final entry?

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:12.353
- Final entry.

01:08:15.025 --> 01:08:16.691
Thank you, for everything.

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:20.462
Cheers.
          - Cheers.

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:27.035
- Sure you wanna do this?

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:30.238
- If we wanna really win,
  it's the only thing to do.

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:33.308
- I'm proud of you, Jake.

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:37.712
(door closes)

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:40.048
- That's your winner, is it?

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.015
(Nicole sighs)

01:08:41.051 --> 01:08:42.550
- I hope so.

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:44.886
- Well, you better put
     that somewhere safe,

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:48.389
the Brandinis are
     liable to interfere.

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:51.559
- Come on, are you saying they
 would sabotage the contest?

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:52.861
That's ridiculous.

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:55.263
- If the shoe fits.

01:08:56.933 --> 01:08:59.067
(Nicole sighs)

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:00.868
- According to this
     partnership agreement,

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:03.104
October 12th, 1976.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:07.408
- Well, it appears you are
  absolutely right, Jake,

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:09.077
and I'll take care of

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:11.645
the construction
     permit this afternoon.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.546
- Thanks, Judge.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:13.247
- Mm-hmm.
        - I look forward

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.716
to finally resolving this issue.

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:16.618
- Consider it done.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.586
Well, I'll see you
      after the contest.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:19.587
- Yes, you will.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:20.622
- I've gotta run.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:21.421
- Thanks.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.223
- Okay.

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:23.992
Oh, hello, Nicole.

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:25.093
- Hi, Judge Monroe.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:28.763
- Hi.

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:30.298
- Hi.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.500
What, uh, what's going on?

01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:35.603
- Oh, uh, you know, just
 taking care of some business.

01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:39.006
- Yeah, I saw you
    talking to Judge Monroe.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:42.609
- Yeah, it was just, you
 know, um, zoning ordinance,

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:43.912
construction permits,
     that kinda thing.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:46.481
- Okay, and does this
     construction permit

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.682
involve me and Cabella?

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.250
- Wait, what?

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:50.451
- Because it sure sounded
  like you were trying

01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:51.618
to sway Judge Monroe
     in your favor.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:54.087
- You think I would
     do that to you?

01:09:54.124 --> 01:09:55.590
- I know what I heard, Jake.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.759
- No, that wasn't what...

01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.794
- (scoffs) You know, I guess
 I should've expected it,

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:01.429
given your family history.

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:03.431
- Please, let me explain,
 I took a document from my--

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:04.499
- No, I can't,

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:07.202
I can't believe that I
 thought you were different.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:08.403
I defended you.

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:14.609
(soft music)

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:23.518
- You skipped dinner.

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:26.387
You're not still
      working, are you?

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:30.225
- Not exactly, just
     stewing, more like.

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.127
- You can stew on a full
 stomach, I fixed you a plate.

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:38.399
- Thanks, but, I don't
  have much of an appetite.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:40.969
- Look, honey, I know you're
 nervous about the competition,

01:10:41.004 --> 01:10:43.471
but we're all so proud of you.

01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:44.372
- Thanks, Grandpa.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:47.508
But it's more than that,

01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:50.144
I thought that I
    understood a situation,

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:51.479
but it turns out I just

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:53.548
(sighs)

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.516
had it completely wrong.

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:59.120
- I'm sorry, sweetheart,
    that's an awful feeling.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:01.222
(soft music)

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:03.424
Sometimes you just have
    to trust your instincts.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.692
- Well, that is the problem,

01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:07.061
my instincts seem to be way off.

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:09.864
- When it comes to making
 olive oil, they're spot-on.

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:12.333
(both chuckle)

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:15.737
Eat this food your mother
  made, get some rest,

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.939
you'll feel better
      in the morning.

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:19.240
Grandpa's orders.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:26.581
- Thanks, Grandpa.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.382
- Yeah.

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:31.352
- Thank you.

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:05.386
(upbeat music)

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:10.625
- Welcome to the Sunset
 Valley Olive Oil Competition.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.960
(applause)

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:15.963
- (sighs) Where is she? I've
 been calling her all morning.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.666
- Sunset Valley treats olive oil

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:20.802
with the utmost seriousness.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.503
We'll be selecting the winner

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:24.806
based on a number of categories:

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:28.509
aroma, flavor, texture,

01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:31.679
and finally, presentation.

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:33.247
Shall we begin?

01:12:33.283 --> 01:12:35.650
Oh, and while we deliberate,

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:38.920
please feel free to taste
 the samples in front of you.

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:42.290
(indistinct chatter)

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:45.526
- Wait, Judge Monroe, wait!
 (upbeat music)

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:46.327
Wait!

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.834
I have to change
      the Cabella entry.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.769
- That's highly unconventional.

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:56.204
- But not against the rules,

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:58.306
she did make it in
     just the nick of time.

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:05.580
- This is Cabella Sunrise.

01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:11.519
- What is she doing?

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:12.920
- Trusting her instincts.

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:15.022
- Here you go.

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:17.792
Oh, sorry, here, there you are.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:21.028
This is Cabella Sunrise.

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.832
- We got this in the bag.

01:13:26.336 --> 01:13:27.935
- I wouldn't be so sure, son.

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:33.241
- I'm so proud of you.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.809
- Thank you.

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:36.210
- You gonna go say hi to Jake?

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.848
- There's no point.

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.823
(upbeat music)

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:53.428
- Do they even
      know what you did?

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:56.330
- It doesn't matter.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.567
- Hey, Billy, come try these.

01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:06.107
- Mm, wow.

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:11.779
- Mm.

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:15.283
- Oh, my, Nicole, this
     is, this is amazing.

01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:17.618
- Thank you. (chuckles)

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:20.121
- This Brandini's
     isn't so bad either.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:22.924
- Raphael,

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:25.393
well done.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.032
- Why, uh, thank you, Frank.

01:14:35.271 --> 01:14:37.205
Your granddaughter
     did a wonderful job.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:40.074
She must've had a great teacher.

01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:46.314
- We have deliberated, and
  we've come to a decision.

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:49.484
- Guys, no matter what happens,

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:50.818
I'm going to save up

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:53.321
and find a way to make
     the expansion happen,

01:14:53.356 --> 01:14:55.756
even if it takes
      a few extra years.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.158
- That's the Cabella spirit.

01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:58.259
(Nicole chuckles)

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:01.262
- And it was unanimous.
    (drum roll)

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.331
Congratulations to

01:15:05.335 --> 01:15:07.201
Cabella Oil!

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:09.036
(cheering and applause)
    (Nicole chuckles)

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:10.271
- Yeah!
          - We won!

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:24.151
We won, we won,
      we won! (chuckles)

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.573
Judge Monroe.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.675
- Nicole, what are
      you doing here?

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.176
- I am here to
     formalize everything

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:51.178
now that we've won the land.

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:52.179
- Jake didn't tell you?

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.347
- Tell me what?

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:54.482
- Oh, before the contest,

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:56.984
he signed a declaration that
 the land belongs to you.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.253
- But, but why?

01:15:59.289 --> 01:16:01.889
- He found more documents
 that showed your border line

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:02.990
was correct all along.

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:04.392
- No, no, but the other day,

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:05.393
I overheard you
      and Jake talking,

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:08.496
it was something about
    my construction permit.

01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:11.699
- That wasn't about
    you, that was for Billy.

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:14.702
(soft music)

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:15.536
- I have to go.

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.708
- There's my little champion.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.411
What a day for the
      Cabella family.

01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:25.947
We finally got the
    recognition we deserve.

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:28.115
- Grandpa, none of that matters.

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:30.217
We keep misjudging things
  and jumping to conclusions

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.253
when it comes to the Brandinis.

01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:34.422
They deserve for us
     to give them a chance.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.894
Excuse me, Grandpa, there's
 something I have to do.

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:44.732
Hey, guys.

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.400
- Well, all hail
     the conquering hero.

01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:48.436
- Yeah, uh, I don't really
  feel like much of a hero.

01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:50.104
- What's wrong?

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:52.139
- Is Jake really helping you
 with a construction permit?

01:16:52.175 --> 01:16:53.174
- He sure is.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:54.408
Yeah, all your talk
  about expanding the ranch

01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:55.710
got me thinking,

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.778
I wanna put a hotel
     above this restaurant.

01:16:57.814 --> 01:17:00.448
Jake offered his legal
     expertise no charge.

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:01.282
- Oh, no.

01:17:02.352 --> 01:17:03.017
Have you seen him?

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:04.785
I've phoned him a million times.

01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:09.056
- He came over here
    earlier, to say goodbye.

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:10.458
Yeah, he already left.

01:17:11.561 --> 01:17:14.695
(soft music)

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:16.097
(Nicole sighs)

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:18.833
(knocks on door)

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:24.972
- Frank?

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:26.974
What are you doing here?

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:28.175
- I, uh,

01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:31.445
thought you might wanna look
 at these old photos with me.

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:34.148
They're of the two of
    us from back in the day.

01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:37.351
(Raphael clears throat)

01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:38.352
- Yeah, I'd love that.

01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:43.658
- And maybe when
     your arm is healed,

01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:45.393
we can whip up a
     batch of oil together

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:46.961
on the original press,

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:47.995
for old times' sake.

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:51.832
- Okay, uh,

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:55.002
but only if you let me add
  my spices to the blend.

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:57.405
- Not on your life.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.373
- You never change, do you?

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:02.109
(Frank chuckles)

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:16.457
(birds chirp)

01:18:29.639 --> 01:18:30.471
- Jake.

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:32.740
Wait, you're still here?

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:34.241
- Yeah.

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:36.243
I know, I know, I'm not
supposed to be on your property,

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:40.181
but I just wanted to enjoy
 the view before I took off.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.449
I'll get outta your way.

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:44.018
- Wait, no, I, I
      tried calling you.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:44.919
- My phone's dead.

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:46.153
It's kinda nice actually.

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.389
- I know what you did for me.

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:51.058
Have you,

01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:52.359
have you ever met someone

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:55.730
with a habit of making
     impulsive decisions?

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:57.932
'Cause I have that habit.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:01.435
I had the wrong
     impression about you.

01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:03.370
Well, I mean, first
     I had it wrong,

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:04.271
and then I thought
     you weren't so bad,

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:05.773
and I had it wrong again--

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:06.874
- Nicole?
         (soft music)

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.109
- Yes?

01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:09.410
- Are you trying
     to apologize to me?

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:10.444
- Yes.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.545
Yeah. (chuckles)

01:19:11.581 --> 01:19:14.582
Yes, I am. (chuckles)

01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:16.784
But, okay, I still
      don't understand

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:18.085
why you couldn't explain to me

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:18.986
what you were doing
     at the courthouse.

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:20.087
- I was torn,

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:22.923
you said you wanted to win
  or lose fair and square.

01:19:22.959 --> 01:19:24.558
- Yeah, I did want that,

01:19:24.594 --> 01:19:27.428
but you, you just let me say
 those awful things to you,

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.597
and I feel terrible.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:31.699
I'm so sorry.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:37.338
So, you off to San Francisco?

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:38.205
- Yep.

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:41.809
To tell my boss I'm going
  to resign from the firm.

01:19:43.146 --> 01:19:43.911
- Really?

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:44.945
- Yeah.

01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:46.981
I wanna work on the ranch.

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:48.516
- For real?

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:49.517
So, um,

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:51.452
I mean, are you ready to put

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:53.654
that acumen of
      yours to good use?

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:56.924
- You know it. (Nicole chuckles)

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:59.760
So, uh, just a warning,

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:02.530
you might be seeing
     a little more of me.

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:04.031
- Oh, I think I'd like that.

01:20:04.066 --> 01:20:05.533
I mean, especially,

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:07.368
especially if you
     wear your new boots.

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:09.703
- I think I can
     agree to those terms.

01:20:09.739 --> 01:20:13.274
- Finally, a
    successful negotiation.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.909
- You really are
      something, Nicole.

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:38.232
- I'll, uh, I'll race
     you to the factory.

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:39.466
- Oh, it is on.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:40.234
- Okay. (chuckles)

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:41.635
- Get back here.

You won. (chuckles)
