You can't hide from Batman.

[GASPS]

17:04.358 --> 17:06.276
Mr. Polka-Dot, the Polka-Dot Man.

Mr. Zero.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.455
Kite Man.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.207
And Zebra-Man.

17:22.251 --> 17:25.254
You're all going down!

Oh, crumbs.

Don't run.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.476
Gather your wits.
Confront your enemies.

18:20.684 --> 18:25.314
I can't.
My imagination is running away with me.

Let me go. Huh?

So many of them.
I can't fight them all. Ooh!

[GRUNTING]

20:06.331 --> 20:08.584
Help me, Batman.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.128
BATMAN:
Are you sure?

20:11.420 --> 20:14.715
I don't wanna steal the spotlight
from the Dark-Mite detective.

20:14.923 --> 20:17.092
I'm sure. I'm sure.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.526
I'm sorry, Batman.

21:17.402 --> 21:22.074
I'm no hero, just a failure in a playsuit
that my mom made.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.993
You have powers that put
other magic users to shame.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.870
Be proud of that.

21:27.079 --> 21:31.416
Someone that powerful
shouldn't blindly follow in my footsteps.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.043
I guess that's true, huh?

21:33.669 --> 21:38.632
Thanks for helping me see the light and
for letting me hang with you for a while.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.517
Whew. What a night.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.019
At least
I sent the little guy home happy.
