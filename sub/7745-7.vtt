00:08.718 --> 00:10.303
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.387 --> 00:14.057
Patient suffered closed comminuted fracture
to left radius.

00:15.725 --> 00:18.353
Hey. How'd it go with broken-nose guy?

00:19.938 --> 00:21.147
Cunt! Cunt, whore, bitch, slut!

00:21.564 --> 00:23.358
<i>She forgot to schedule two nurse shifts.</i>

00:23.441 --> 00:25.485
Hell, she even named me chief
without telling anyone.

00:25.568 --> 00:26.695
All right, what do you want?

00:26.778 --> 00:31.032
I want to know in a life-death business
that we're all here.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.414
I'm sorry, I think I'm a little nervous.

00:38.123 --> 00:40.208
All you gotta do is meet me halfway, okay?

02:33.655 --> 02:35.240
You look pretty.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.536
Okay, back in an hour. Lunch.

02:41.037 --> 02:45.375
With the handsome cop who just happens
to be standing right over there?

02:47.710 --> 02:49.003
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:49.254 --> 02:51.965
- I thought I was meeting you there.
- Yeah, you were.

02:52.048 --> 02:56.052
Here's the thing. They called me down
to the South Street Seaport, so I'm sorry.

02:56.219 --> 02:59.138
- And you came down here just to cancel?
- Yeah.

02:59.222 --> 03:02.058
I'm gonna cancel with a text message?
What am I, a 14-year-old?

03:03.351 --> 03:05.311
- You'll give me a rain check?
- Yeah, okay.

03:05.395 --> 03:07.397
Good. I have to go fight crime.

03:08.064 --> 03:09.232
Yes, you do.

03:16.739 --> 03:19.325
He canceled in person.
That's a really good sign.

03:19.409 --> 03:21.828
- And you're still pretty.
- I know.

03:24.163 --> 03:26.583
I'm gonna go see if Eddie's free.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.054
Holy shit.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.390
Well, it breaks up the day.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.267
Fire in the hole!

03:44.601 --> 03:47.520
Yeah, that's Mr. Collins, my psych patient.

03:47.812 --> 03:50.481
Akalitus was supposed to
get him a security escort upstairs.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.278
Guess she forgot.

03:55.486 --> 03:56.529
No!

03:57.238 --> 03:59.824
- All right, watch it.
- Fuck you, guys!

04:09.250 --> 04:12.337
- I've had dreams like this.
- What a mess.

04:13.129 --> 04:15.632
Well, I'm on lunch. How can I help?

04:16.966 --> 04:18.843
You can start to sweep.

04:18.927 --> 04:22.639
I gotta log every one of these pills
before I throw it out.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.017
Nobody move.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.356
It's kind of pretty.

04:31.648 --> 04:34.651
Nothing around here is ever pretty.
Thank you.

04:38.988 --> 04:42.492
<i>Patient presented with a compound fracture
of the left fibula.</i>

04:42.575 --> 04:45.828
"Patient presented
with a compound fracture..."

04:46.829 --> 04:47.997
Gauze.

04:48.498 --> 04:49.999
Gauze, please.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.091
Lidocaine.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.511
Today.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.930
- Give me one second.
-It should already be ready.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.264
I got it.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.559
What's with the tap-out?

05:08.935 --> 05:11.312
I'll talk to her. She'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.

05:12.522 --> 05:14.983
- Sutures.
- You know, Marta's a temp.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.442
She doesn't know where everything is.

05:16.526 --> 05:18.695
Well, then, she needs to figure it out,
now doesn't she?

05:20.530 --> 05:23.658
Did anybody ever tell you
you have a nice smile?

05:24.450 --> 05:25.493
No.

05:27.078 --> 05:28.621
So, what, you don't think I'm nice?

05:28.871 --> 05:31.874
Well, personally
I do very well with cranky people.

05:31.958 --> 05:37.547
Some of my favorite people are cranky.
My grandfather, my mom's dog,

05:39.257 --> 05:40.466
Jackie.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.554
And now you're putting me on that list.

05:44.846 --> 05:46.180
We'll see.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.067
Jackie, what are you doing?

05:59.777 --> 06:01.195
I'm helping.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.990
Are you sure you're okay
standing on a carpet of narcotics?

06:04.073 --> 06:06.325
Well, I know
I'm only in my first year of recovery,

06:06.409 --> 06:09.787
but it was my understanding that unless
you actually ingest them, you're fine.

06:12.749 --> 06:13.958
What a mess.

06:14.042 --> 06:18.046
So, you said you were gonna get an escort
for that psych patient.

06:18.588 --> 06:20.673
Got a lot going on today.
It must have slipped my mind.

06:20.757 --> 06:21.966
You forgot, which is fine.

06:22.050 --> 06:24.844
But that's kind of been
happening a lot lately.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.429
Do you think maybe you should
talk to a doctor?

06:27.847 --> 06:31.184
I work in a hospital, Jackie.
All I do is talk to doctors.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.354
You know, I'm just gonna say it.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.315
Is it Alzheimer's?
Is that what we're dealing with?

06:37.398 --> 06:38.691
Let's not jump off the cliff.

06:38.816 --> 06:39.859
It's getting dangerous.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.695
She's not talking about it.
She's obviously not doing anything about it.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.782
It could be other things.
Brain tumor, liver toxicity.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.533
I feel so much better.

06:47.617 --> 06:50.078
If we could get her to take a blood test,
we might get some answers.

06:50.161 --> 06:52.038
Yeah, good luck with that.

06:52.121 --> 06:54.332
I just tried to talk to her about it
and she stonewalled me.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.335
- She'll never give a blood test.
- Maybe in her sleep?

07:06.636 --> 07:09.680
Six pills went missing after the cleanup.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.518
You know what that means.

07:14.018 --> 07:17.814
Mandatory blood testing
for everyone in and out of this room.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.733
Protocol.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.820
<i>Patient suffered closed comminuted fracture
to left radius.</i>

07:33.121 --> 07:34.705
<i>- Hey, you.
- So I'm standing under</i> a <i>sign</i>

07:34.789 --> 07:36.165
<i>that says "South Street Seaport."</i>

07:36.624 --> 07:40.044
This guy comes up to me and says,
"Where is the South Street Seaport?"

07:40.545 --> 07:42.588
<i>Knuckleheads. Stay inside.</i>

07:42.922 --> 07:44.841
The city is teeming with knuckleheads.

07:45.007 --> 07:49.303
- And you called to tell me that?
- No, I just... I feel bad about canceling.

07:49.387 --> 07:50.763
Tell me how I can make it up to you.

07:51.681 --> 07:53.432
- Bring me back a hot pretzel.
- You got it.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.518
One hot pretzel coming up.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.979
Wait a minute, it's not gonna be hot
by the time I get it to you.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.231
Well, I'm sure we can heat it up.

08:00.815 --> 08:02.191
<i>I actually just said that.</i>

08:02.733 --> 08:04.068
I'm sorry.

08:04.610 --> 08:07.655
Don't you be sorry.
I'm gonna call you soon, all right?

08:07.864 --> 08:09.365
All right, bye.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.034
<i>This is weird.</i>

08:12.535 --> 08:13.828
-Okay.
-"Okay."

08:13.911 --> 08:15.413
-Okay.
-"Okay."

08:15.580 --> 08:17.456
<i>- You're</i> a <i>slut.
-"You're</i> a <i>slut."</i>

08:26.549 --> 08:28.634
<i>- You're a bitch.
-Oh, my God.</i>

08:28.718 --> 08:30.845
<i>- You're such a bitch.
-Oh, my God.</i>

08:32.221 --> 08:33.556
Oh, my God.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.818
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, <i>mama!</i>

08:45.902 --> 08:47.904
Oh, my God!

08:48.905 --> 08:50.573
Oh, my God!

08:50.823 --> 08:52.325
<i>You're a cunt!</i>

08:53.284 --> 08:54.660
Oh, my God.

08:55.411 --> 08:56.579
What's up, Zoey?

08:56.662 --> 08:58.331
I have a sex tape.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.083
Not of me, of Coop.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.629
- And he's saying really dirty things.
- Jesus.

09:04.921 --> 09:06.214
- What are you bringing it here for?
- Take it!

09:06.297 --> 09:08.132
- I don't want it.
- I don't want it either.

09:19.227 --> 09:22.230
Sorry, sorry, sorry I am late.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.106
I hate that.

09:24.899 --> 09:27.068
- So, here's...
- Allison.

09:27.151 --> 09:29.528
Patient, Allison. What's up?

09:29.946 --> 09:31.614
I'm feeling really, really crappy.

09:31.948 --> 09:33.741
- Crappy how?
- Achy...

09:35.117 --> 09:37.745
Stomach hurts, sharp pain in my side.

09:37.954 --> 09:39.330
Achy, right.

09:41.374 --> 09:43.501
Temperature's elevated. 102.

09:43.793 --> 09:46.170
Don't worry, Allison, we'll figure this out.
Right, Dr. Roman?

09:47.838 --> 09:51.008
Yeah, there is a bug going around.
Take some Advil.

09:51.259 --> 09:54.553
If the cramps get really bad,
grab some over-the-counter antacids.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.723
Upside of the flu... Skinny jeans tomorrow.

09:57.807 --> 09:59.850
I think we might be missing something here.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.395
Right, of course.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.897
So, plenty of fluids...

10:07.316 --> 10:09.151
Appendicitis? Classic.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.570
No, I think it's just the flu.

10:11.946 --> 10:15.658
Let's check it out. Get her a CT scan
of the right lower quadrant and call the OR.

10:16.951 --> 10:18.786
Saving lives and taking names.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.708
What?

10:23.916 --> 10:25.668
<i>Okay, you're a slut.</i>

10:26.669 --> 10:29.964
- You're a <i>bitch.</i>
- Shit, shit! Okay, that wasn't me.

10:30.214 --> 10:33.134
I mean, it was me,
but I don't talk to women that way.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.761
- She had flash cards.
- She... I'm not following.

10:35.845 --> 10:38.806
Okay, I was minding my own business,
doing dictation.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.766
Dr. Roman came into my office
with flash cards.

10:40.850 --> 10:42.727
The first one said,
"Take your pants off," so...

10:42.810 --> 10:44.353
Okay, stop. Stop talking.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.188
It's not my fault.
She was telling me what to do.

10:46.731 --> 10:49.734
See, that's the problem.
You should be telling her what to do.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.570
You saw what happened.
She missed the fucking appendicitis.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.949
- I'm shocked that got recorded.
- Really?

10:57.033 --> 10:58.534
Zoey's not gonna be able
to sleep for a week.

10:58.784 --> 10:59.785
I'm so embarrassed.

10:59.869 --> 11:03.205
Are you embarrassed enough
to get your fucking head out of your ass?

11:03.289 --> 11:05.875
How many times do we have to have
this conversation before you get it?

11:07.877 --> 11:10.880
Okay, you're right.
What do you want me to do?

11:11.088 --> 11:13.799
Well, maybe if you stopped fucking her
and started teaching her,

11:13.883 --> 11:16.385
we all might be better off, including her.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.433
Thank you.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.727
Thirsty?

11:25.061 --> 11:27.813
I just got notice
that there is a mandatory drug test.

11:27.897 --> 11:29.899
I was only in the pharmacy for a minute.

11:29.982 --> 11:32.485
So they're gonna find out you're diabetic,
right?

11:32.568 --> 11:38.157
Let's just say that I went out with
a 23-year-old dancer/mime last night.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.202
- Okay.
- No, not okay. A mime?

11:41.285 --> 11:44.830
More of a Mummenschanz type.
It doesn't matter.

11:45.081 --> 11:49.126
Let's just say that
he hypothetically offered me a joint,

11:49.460 --> 11:55.216
and let's just say
that I hypothetically got baked, okay?

11:55.299 --> 11:59.053
I didn't even smoke in college.
And now I could lose my job?

11:59.387 --> 12:01.138
This is why I don't go out.

12:01.222 --> 12:04.266
Thor, please stop.
Everything is gonna be fine.

12:04.392 --> 12:07.061
That's what people always say
right before everything turns to shit.

12:07.144 --> 12:10.940
Listen, we need to run Akalitus' blood,
find out about her memory issues.

12:11.065 --> 12:13.359
So you save Akalitus,
but you throw me under the bus.

12:13.442 --> 12:16.112
- You always liked her better.
- Please take it easy, Thor.

12:16.195 --> 12:19.448
We know how to lose a blood specimen.
Trust me.

12:26.622 --> 12:32.128
Jeez, look at those sharp military corners.

12:39.552 --> 12:41.595
- Thank you.
- No problem.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.561
Dr. Prentiss,
I did not see you standing there.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.021
- I don't do hugs.
-It's a gesture.

12:51.105 --> 12:53.607
I don't believe in gestures.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.652
Yes, you do.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.948
Respect, Doctor.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.047
Are you crying?

13:17.339 --> 13:21.260
I have my eyelashes put on individually
and sometimes they come loose.

13:21.469 --> 13:23.512
It's a fucking mess.

13:34.273 --> 13:36.859
- That patient could have died.
- Jesus.

13:38.194 --> 13:41.113
- I feel bad enough.
- I'm not sure you do.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.365
Look, we're not gods.

13:43.532 --> 13:47.036
We don't always get it right.
But that one was pretty close.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.245
<i>Madeline.</i>

13:49.038 --> 13:51.332
<i>Excuse me'?
-You know, Madeline.</i>

13:53.584 --> 13:56.295
It's a kids' book. French orphan.

13:57.463 --> 13:59.006
Red bob, cute hat.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.008
Yeah.

14:01.717 --> 14:04.220
She had her appendix out.

14:04.887 --> 14:08.224
It's the first medical thing
any little girl learns.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.185
And I missed it.

14:16.398 --> 14:20.444
Carrie, can I just ask,
why do you want to be a doctor?

14:22.905 --> 14:25.574
Do yourself a favor. Don't answer now.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.077
Things have to change
if you're going to stay here.

14:28.369 --> 14:30.246
You have to get better.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.082
I'm not letting anybody die
because you're distracted.

14:34.959 --> 14:37.920
So from now on, I am going to teach
and you are going to learn.

14:38.087 --> 14:39.171
Okay.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.469
Give me your phone.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.305
- What?
- Your phone.

14:49.098 --> 14:50.432
I'll put it in airplane mode.

14:56.939 --> 14:57.940
Pay attention.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.943
- Watch what I do.
- Okay.

15:09.451 --> 15:10.786
Thank you, Dr. Prentiss.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.127
So generous.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.004
- Hey, thanks.
- Thanks.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.631
Thanks, Doc.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.720
Sugar-free vanilla decaf, extra foamy.

15:28.137 --> 15:29.638
Close enough.

15:30.014 --> 15:32.141
This is really nice of you.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.018
So I bought everyone coffee today?

15:34.101 --> 15:38.272
As a gesture. And you owe someone $43.65.

15:38.439 --> 15:39.648
Hey, thanks for this.

15:39.732 --> 15:42.776
Coffees down, people.
Critical gunshot wound. Three minutes out.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.278
NYPD cop shot.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.697
- Where are they coming from?
- Where?

15:47.364 --> 15:48.657
South Street Seaport.

15:50.576 --> 15:53.537
He's got two wounds.
One thoracic, one to the groin.

15:53.621 --> 15:56.081
- Dr. Prentiss, you're gonna need backup.
- Page Dr. Cooper.

15:56.457 --> 15:58.584
Get the sprained ankle out of the hallway
into a bay.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.878
<i>Dr. Cooper to trauma. Dr. Cooper to trauma.</i>

16:00.961 --> 16:03.547
We need all visitors
to return to the waiting room, please.

16:03.631 --> 16:05.090
We have to clear out this area.

16:05.174 --> 16:07.676
And call radiology,
let them know we got a cop coming in.

16:07.760 --> 16:08.761
Call the lab.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.679
We need a STAT type and cross
as soon as the guy gets here.

16:10.763 --> 16:14.433
- And get me some O neg blood down here.
- Yeah, it's on its way.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.268
Where is he working?

16:18.020 --> 16:21.523
-It's not him. I can feel it in my gut. It's not.
- Zoey.

16:29.573 --> 16:33.118
Pick up. Please pick up.
Please pick up. Please pick up.

16:33.952 --> 16:38.791
<i>Hey, you've almost reached Frank Verelli.
Leave a message. I'll get back to you.</i>

16:40.334 --> 16:42.252
Hi, Frank. It's Jackie.

16:42.336 --> 16:46.799
Can you do me a favor and give me a call
when you get this message, please?

16:46.882 --> 16:50.010
Yeah. My phone is on, okay?
Thanks. Please call.

16:51.387 --> 16:53.097
Thirty seconds out.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.124
- What's his name?
- Donnie Wallace.

17:20.541 --> 17:24.086
Two entry wounds, no visible exit wounds.
No known allergies to medications.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.505
Dispatch has already called his wife.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.632
BP's 100/palp. He's been in and out.

17:28.716 --> 17:30.175
Lost him once in the truck,
but got him back.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.180
Okay, on my count. One, two, three.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.561
I got the leg. Dr. Cooper, you get the chest.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.522
Hey, Donnie, I need you to stick with us,
sweetheart, okay?

17:43.605 --> 17:45.941
Call X-ray.
We need a STAT portable chest now.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.484
His wife is on the way.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.695
Absent breath on the left side
with tracheal shift.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.697
- Chest tube.
- You hear that, Donnie?

17:51.780 --> 17:53.115
Your wife is on her way.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.617
Fuck me. Bullet may have torn
through the femoral artery.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.787
First thing you're gonna see
when you open your eyes is your wife,

17:58.871 --> 18:00.622
and she is gonna be so happy.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.502
- BP's dropping.
- He's bleeding out.

18:05.586 --> 18:07.379
Can't see anything.
Gotta open him up. Scalpel.

18:07.463 --> 18:09.840
We can't do that here.
We need to stabilize him, get him upstairs.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.592
I'm not gonna let him die on the elevator.
Scalpel.

18:19.391 --> 18:20.726
Retracto r.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.816
Shit. The artery's split.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.111
- I need 10 seconds of stillness.
- I need five first.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.454
- Okay, go.
- Okay, everybody, hands off.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.124
I can't get it. Fuck.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.045
I can't get a grasp.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.463
I got it.

18:54.343 --> 18:56.345
- You good?
- Good enough. Let's get him to the OR.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.365
Hey, do we know anything yet?

19:17.032 --> 19:20.118
Our best doctor is with him.
Hopefully it won't be much longer.

19:21.537 --> 19:23.080
Did you want...

19:24.540 --> 19:26.750
All right, they got the best they got.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.585
Okay.

19:29.503 --> 19:31.046
Officer Wallace is out of surgery.

19:31.129 --> 19:35.133
He has a pneumothorax
and a large pulmonary contusion on the left,

19:35.884 --> 19:38.887
and the thoracic cavity
was punctured by the...

19:38.971 --> 19:39.972
Can I hold that for you?

19:55.904 --> 20:00.242
Donnie will be in the hospital for a while.
Then we're gonna move him on to rehab.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.410
But let me tell you something.

20:03.704 --> 20:06.748
He's made of some strong stuff
and I guarantee you he will walk out of here.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.087
Thanks, Doc.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.924
Thank you.

20:16.842 --> 20:17.926
Okay.

20:27.436 --> 20:29.688
Officer, do you have a minute?

20:39.114 --> 20:41.450
Okay. It's okay.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.285
I'm fine, okay? All right?

20:44.578 --> 20:46.288
It wasn't me, okay?

20:47.205 --> 20:48.665
Jack, I wouldn't do that to you.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.796
Oh, man.

20:56.173 --> 20:59.468
- He wasn't wearing his vest?
- Yeah, it was stuffy as hell in there.

20:59.551 --> 21:02.679
- So he took off his bulletproof vest?
- I've done it.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.182
Do not tell me that.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.226
Okay. I will try not to do it again.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.811
No, don't try. Don't do it.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.649
I don't know.

21:14.066 --> 21:15.442
I kind of like it when you worry about me.

21:19.655 --> 21:20.822
I get off in an hour.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.493
Yeah, you don't understand.

21:24.576 --> 21:25.786
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.955
We're gonna hang around here
for a little while longer

21:28.038 --> 21:31.792
till we decide it's time to go to the bar
and get shitfaced.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.336
I'm gonna have about five beers,
then I'm gonna call you.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.713
I'm gonna wanna come over

21:37.464 --> 21:39.007
and I'm gonna wanna sleep with you.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.302
That's not the way I want it to happen
between us, okay?

21:42.386 --> 21:46.348
So don't pick up the phone,
no matter how many times I call.

21:48.642 --> 21:49.851
How many times are you gonna call?

21:51.603 --> 21:52.646
I'm gonna call a lot,

21:53.855 --> 21:55.941
so don't pick up the phone.

21:56.692 --> 21:57.818
Okay.

21:57.943 --> 22:00.112
- I'm serious.
- Me, too.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.571
I'm not interested in hearing about

22:01.655 --> 22:04.157
all the disgusting things that happen
when cops get hammered.

22:05.951 --> 22:08.370
Hey, you and me,
we got a good thing going here.

22:08.453 --> 22:11.707
And I don't wanna fuck this up
with 11 beers in me.

22:11.790 --> 22:15.293
You just went from five beers to 11
in about 30 seconds.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.962
See what I mean?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.886
Okay, baby. All right.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.729
Hey, what doctor saved Donnie?

22:34.062 --> 22:35.439
Over there.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.274
He's a hugger.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.152
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.

22:41.111 --> 22:42.863
Thank you. Thank you so much.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.492
Okay.

22:48.035 --> 22:49.619
Okay, all right.

22:50.871 --> 22:52.748
- Thank you.
- No problem.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.801
Well, that was pretty awesome, right?

23:05.260 --> 23:07.679
I mean, the rush of saving a life.

23:08.972 --> 23:10.599
I felt it today.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.310
I felt what it feels like to be a doctor.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.230
You are really full of shit.

23:20.734 --> 23:24.738
You asked why I want to be a doctor.
I'm trying to answer your question.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.157
You know how you answer that question?
By trying.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.951
By trying with a lady with the cramps
and the guy with the fucked-up feet.

23:30.035 --> 23:33.038
You start trying to treat people, and
maybe there's an answer to that question.

23:33.121 --> 23:36.958
- Maybe there's not. That's up to you.
- You're talking a lot.

23:37.167 --> 23:40.003
Because I want you to learn something
every day.

23:40.087 --> 23:42.589
And if I do my job right,
I am going to teach you something.

23:43.090 --> 23:45.175
So it's not just about you, okay?

23:48.303 --> 23:49.387
Wait.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.310
I totally forgot you had this.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.034
Drug test time.

24:12.035 --> 24:15.622
My future is on the line
and you have the nerve to smile.

24:16.498 --> 24:21.169
- Your boys better lose that specimen.
- Relax. I got your back.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.756
Gentlemen, I know
this is somewhat of an inconvenience.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.843
- I appreciate your cooperation.
-It's nothing.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.302
I don't know about you guys,

24:29.386 --> 24:33.890
but when it's over, I'm going outside
and smoking myself a big fat doobie.

24:35.684 --> 24:38.186
Sorry. I was counting pills all day.

24:43.441 --> 24:45.569
Hold the door. Hold the door.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.736
Thank you.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.489
Jackie, everything gonna be okay upstairs?

24:49.573 --> 24:52.033
- Eleven months and counting.
- Good.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.287
Stop miming.
I'll never tell you anything again.

26:03.313 --> 26:07.817
<i>And we have more information
on the NYPD officer who was shot today.</i>

26:08.109 --> 26:09.653
<i>Doctors at All Saints Hospital</i>

26:09.736 --> 26:13.740
<i>upgraded Officer Donnie Wallace

26:13.823 --> 26:15.742
<i>He's expected to make a full recovery.</i>

26:16.159 --> 26:20.163
<i>Wallace is the third officer in the area
shot in the past 10 days.</i>

26:20.330 --> 26:24.084
<i>A Nassau County patrolman shot last week
died this morning,</i>

26:24.167 --> 26:26.253
<i>leaving behind a wife and infant son.</i>

26:41.393 --> 26:43.812
<i>- Hello?
- One, two, three.</i>

27:03.039 --> 27:05.083
I told you not to pick up the phone!

27:07.168 --> 27:08.378
<i>Sing, you badges!</i>

27:17.012 --> 27:19.139
It's my first beer, I swear!
