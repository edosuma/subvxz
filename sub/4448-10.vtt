19:49.385 --> 19:52.263
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE JUST SAID,
"WHY I WANT TO BE MY GRANDPA."

LAW ENFORCERS IN THE WORLD.

TO AN FBI AGENT

IS TRUTH AND JUSTICE."

20:05.401 --> 20:06.569
I LIKE THAT LINE.

WITH BIG DREAMS.

I REALLY NEVER EXPECTED
A COMMENDATION

20:16.787 --> 20:21.626
I WISH THIS CONCERNED
A COMMENDATION.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.210
BADILLO'S REPORTS
ON YOU LATELY

THAN GLOWING.

BEEN REPEATEDLY INSUBORDINATE‐‐

20:27.340 --> 20:29.800

TIRELESSLY SUBORDINATE,

DESPITE HIS INCREASED
ZEALOTRY AND PARANOIA.

20:32.553 --> 20:35.097
DOES IT ALSO SAY
THAT HE PUT A BUG IN MY ROOM?

20:35.139 --> 20:37.433
‐ AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IT DOES.

20:37.475 --> 20:39.727
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE
AS TO WHY HE MAY HAVE DONE THAT?

20:39.769 --> 20:42.647

I WAS EITHER UNWILLING

20:42.730 --> 20:44.482

TO HANDLE MY ASSIGNMENT.

UNWILLING OR INEPT?

TO COME DOWN ON YOU.

21:03.918 --> 21:06.087

THREE DAYS AGO.

21:10.716 --> 21:11.884

TALKING ABOUT?

21:11.968 --> 21:14.971

BANK RECORDS‐‐

21:15.012 --> 21:16.639

21:16.681 --> 21:17.765
CAN YOU ACCOUNT
FOR THE WHEREABOUTS

21:17.807 --> 21:22.019

THESE PAST FEW DAYS?

21:22.103 --> 21:23.646
‐ YOU THINK
BRIGGS IS RESPONSIBLE?

21:23.729 --> 21:25.982
‐ WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED YOU
TO ASCERTAIN.

21:34.115 --> 21:37.201
‐ I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS, UM‐‐

21:37.284 --> 21:39.954
THIS IS CRAZY.

21:40.037 --> 21:43.165
I DON'T EVEN THINK
BRIGGS KNOWS JUAN EXISTS.

21:43.249 --> 21:44.709
‐ WELL,
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.460
WHAT WE DO KNOW
IS THAT BADILLO CHECKED OUT

21:46.544 --> 21:50.631

ON HIS LAST DAY.

21:50.673 --> 21:52.675
‐ YEAH,
AN AUTO MOUNT.

21:52.717 --> 21:55.136
HE THOUGHT BRIGGS MIGHT BE
WORKING WITH THE CAZA CARTEL.

21:55.177 --> 21:57.346
HE'D HOPED
THAT HE'D SELF‐INCRIMINATE.

21:57.430 --> 21:58.639
‐ AND IF HE DID
PURSUE BRIGGS

21:58.681 --> 22:00.349
IN ORDER
TO RECORD THAT ADMISSION?

22:00.433 --> 22:05.563

WOULD BE ON TAPE.

22:05.646 --> 22:06.814
WHERE'S JUAN'S CAR?

22:06.856 --> 22:09.692

22:09.734 --> 22:11.235
BUT YOU'RE CLOSE
TO BRIGGS,

22:11.318 --> 22:13.654
AND THAT'S A GOOD PLACE
TO START LOOKING.

22:13.696 --> 22:15.573
WE'VE ALL GOT A LOT
OF RESPECT

22:15.656 --> 22:20.453
FOR THE WORK BRIGGS HAS DONE
FOR THE BUREAU.

22:20.494 --> 22:24.415
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
WE DETERMINE

22:24.498 --> 22:28.961
IF HE'S THAT GUY,
OR IS HE THAT GUY.

WE LOVE YOU, BUT YOU ARE
EMINENTLY SABOTAGE‐ABLE.

22:53.235 --> 22:54.320

DON'T COUNT, SON.

22:54.403 --> 22:57.782

ABSOLUTELY COUNTS.

IF YOU WANT TO WORK IT OUT,

29:37.139 --> 29:38.223
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

29:38.307 --> 29:39.808
‐ HEY,
SHE WANTS THE NIGHT,

29:39.892 --> 29:41.268
I GIVE HER
THE NIGHT.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.854
BUT I'LL BE THERE
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

29:43.937 --> 29:45.147
YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,

29:45.230 --> 29:46.356
IF YOU DON'T FIGHT
FOR SOMETHING YOU WANT,

29:46.440 --> 29:47.608
YOU END UP ALONE.

29:53.447 --> 29:54.656
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:54.740 --> 29:56.700
I THINK I'M GOING
TO GET UP OUT OF HERE.

29:56.783 --> 29:57.951
‐ FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE GOING

29:57.993 --> 29:59.786
TO MAKE THAT SURPRISE PARTY
AFTER ALL.

29:59.828 --> 30:00.996
‐ HEY, MAYBE I GOT
A SECOND CHANCE

30:01.079 --> 30:02.289
TO NOT END UP ALONE.

30:02.331 --> 30:04.541
‐ OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

30:04.625 --> 30:05.792
I GOT IT THIS TIME.

30:09.671 --> 30:12.466
[waves crashing]

30:12.549 --> 30:15.552
‐ OKAY, SHERLOCK,
TIME FOR A BREAK, HUH?

30:15.636 --> 30:18.513
YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR MIND OFF OF ODIN.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.182
‐ I'M NOT LETTING THIS GO.

30:20.265 --> 30:21.683
‐ [clears throat]

30:21.725 --> 30:23.143
YOU KNOW WHAT, SUGAR,

30:23.185 --> 30:25.812
YOU COULD BE DOING THIS WORK
ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE.

30:25.854 --> 30:27.356
BUT YOU'RE SITTING OUT HERE
FOR A REASON.

30:27.397 --> 30:29.650
‐ YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT, I AM.

30:29.691 --> 30:32.152
MAYBE I'M JUST HOPING THAT
YOU'LL PUT YOUR HEAD IN THIS

30:32.194 --> 30:34.696
AND HELP ME,
MAYBE PARTICIPATE IN THIS CASE.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.365
OTHER THAN MIKEY,
YOU'RE ALL PRETENDING

30:36.448 --> 30:37.824
THAT YOU ALL SOLVED
THE WORLD'S LAST CRIME.

30:37.866 --> 30:39.243
‐ MM‐HMM.

30:39.326 --> 30:42.162
IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT MAYBE ODIN'S GOT US BEAT?

30:42.204 --> 30:43.497
‐ [scoffs]

30:43.580 --> 30:46.124
THE PAUL BRIGGS I KNOW
DOESN'T GET BEAT.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.085
‐ I'LL DIVE IN WITH YOU
<i>MANANA,</i> ALL RIGHT?

30:48.168 --> 30:49.586
BOTH FEET, I PROMISE.
HOW'S THAT?

30:49.670 --> 30:51.672
[indistinct party chatter]

30:51.755 --> 30:53.006
‐ YEAH, TOMORROW.

30:53.090 --> 30:54.925
‐ CHARLIE...
CHARLIE, COME BACK.

30:55.008 --> 30:56.385
‐ I GOTTA GO.
‐ NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO‐‐

30:56.468 --> 30:57.886
SOMEONE'S GOTTA BE HERE
WHEN JAKES SHOWS UP.

30:57.928 --> 30:59.513
‐ GET OUT OF MY WAY, JOHNNY.
‐ CHARLIE, LOOK, CHILL.

30:59.554 --> 31:01.515
OKAY, AT LEAST REVEL IN
THE GLORY THAT IS KING'S CASTLE.

31:01.556 --> 31:03.141
‐ YOU WANT ME TO REVEL?
‐ I DID ALL THIS FOR YOU.

31:03.225 --> 31:04.559
‐ ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S YOUR REVEL.

31:04.643 --> 31:06.603
‐ NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
NO, CHARLIE!

31:06.687 --> 31:07.980
[all gasping and groaning]

31:08.063 --> 31:09.606
WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

31:09.690 --> 31:10.816
[air hissing]

31:10.899 --> 31:12.025
NO, NO, NO, KEEP BOUNCING,
KEEP BOUNCING.

31:12.067 --> 31:14.486
KEEP BOUNCING, NO, NO.
DAMN IT, CHARLIE!

31:14.569 --> 31:15.612
[girls screaming]
NO, NO, LOOK, I'M HOLDING IT.

31:15.696 --> 31:17.030
LOOK, I'M HOLDING IT.
I'M HOLDING IT.

31:17.072 --> 31:18.532
I'M HOLDING IT.
IT'S OKAY, IT'S O‐‐

31:18.573 --> 31:19.574
[overlapping chatter]

31:19.658 --> 31:20.617
‐ PARTY'S OVER.

31:20.701 --> 31:22.244
‐ OH, NO!

31:25.330 --> 31:27.165
[doorbell ringing]

31:32.504 --> 31:35.632
‐ DALE?
‐ HEY, CASSIE.

31:35.716 --> 31:39.511
‐ IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
‐ YEAH, EVERYTHING IS GREAT.

31:39.594 --> 31:41.972
I JUST‐‐YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU.

31:42.055 --> 31:43.265
‐ ARE YOU DRUNK?

31:43.307 --> 31:46.268
‐ I HAD DRINKS, YES.
AM I DRUNK? NO.

31:46.351 --> 31:47.936
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE, CASSIE.
‐ IT'S ALMOST 3 A. M.

31:47.978 --> 31:51.440
‐ I KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS.

31:51.481 --> 31:54.943
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT...

31:55.027 --> 31:56.361
‐ WHAT?
‐ YOU AND I...

31:56.445 --> 31:57.988
MAKING ANOTHER GO
AT THIS, CASSIE.

31:59.948 --> 32:01.908
‐ DALE, I...
I CAN'T.

32:01.992 --> 32:04.244
‐ YES, YES.
YES, YOU CAN.

32:04.328 --> 32:06.079
BABY, WE CAN
BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

32:06.163 --> 32:07.581
LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU AND DEREK

32:07.664 --> 32:10.000
HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH.

32:10.083 --> 32:11.668
‐ W‐WAIT, HAVE YOU‐‐HAVE YOU
BEEN TALKING TO DEREK?

32:11.752 --> 32:13.170
‐ AND‐‐AND‐‐AND
WE CAN BE A FAMILY.

32:13.253 --> 32:15.756
‐ DALE, DID YOU TALK TO DEREK?
‐ I CAN BE DANIEL'S REAL FATHER.

32:15.839 --> 32:17.924
‐ WELL, WHAT THE HELL, DALE?
‐ HEY!

32:17.966 --> 32:20.469
YEAH, YEAH,
I TALKED TO DEREK.

32:20.552 --> 32:22.137
I RAN INTO HIM IN A BAR.

32:22.179 --> 32:23.638
I BOUGHT THE GUY
A COUPLE DRINKS.

32:23.722 --> 32:26.391
‐ DOES HE KNOW
WHO YOU ARE?

32:26.475 --> 32:27.934
YOU KNOW, HOW DARE YOU?

32:27.976 --> 32:29.436
HOW DARE YOU?
GET‐‐GET OUT.

32:29.478 --> 32:30.479
‐ HEY, HEY, HEY‐‐
‐ GET OUT!

32:30.520 --> 32:32.522
‐ LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

32:32.606 --> 32:33.982
LOOK, I'M TRYING
TO BE HERE FOR YOU.

32:34.066 --> 32:36.234
‐ WELL, YOU HAD THAT CHANCE
AND YOU PASSED, DALE.

32:36.318 --> 32:37.944
‐ I KNOW, I KNOW.

32:37.986 --> 32:39.404
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I WAS TOXIC.

32:39.446 --> 32:41.615
‐ WELL, YOU WEREN'T.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.283
BUT NOW YOU'RE DRUNK
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

32:43.325 --> 32:44.534
POUNDING ON MY DOOR.

32:44.618 --> 32:48.163
NOW YOU'RE TOXIC.

32:48.246 --> 32:50.665
‐ I'M SORRY.

32:52.125 --> 32:55.170
‐ I‐I DIDN'T WANT
TO DO THIS, DALE, BUT‐‐

32:55.253 --> 32:56.671
‐ CASSIE, CASSIE...
‐ BUT YOU CAN'T COME BACK HERE.

32:56.755 --> 32:58.298
‐ CASSIE, I SAID I'M SORRY.
‐ EVER.

32:58.382 --> 33:00.467
‐ WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
I'LL SAY ANYTHING.

33:00.509 --> 33:02.010
‐ I KNOW YOU'RE SORRY, DALE.

33:02.094 --> 33:03.095
‐ BABY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

33:03.178 --> 33:04.429
‐ I KNOW.

33:04.513 --> 33:05.472
‐ BABY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO S‐‐

33:07.641 --> 33:09.226
[lock clicks]

33:09.309 --> 33:12.187
[scoffs, sighs]

33:19.861 --> 33:22.739
‐ NOT THE FIRST DYSFUNCTIONAL
FAMILY I'VE BEEN A PART OF.

33:22.823 --> 33:23.990
‐ [laughs]

33:24.074 --> 33:26.993
‐ OH...MY POOR MAMA.

33:27.035 --> 33:29.204
SHE HAD HER HANDS FULL
WITH THE FOUR OF US.

33:29.287 --> 33:30.997
‐ ALL BOYS?
‐ YEAH.

33:31.081 --> 33:34.167
YEAH, JUST BAD‐ASS KIDS, TOO.
LIKE, HORRIBLE.

33:34.251 --> 33:35.585
[laughter]

33:35.669 --> 33:37.629
EVERY WHIPPING WE EVER GOT
WAS DEFINITELY EARNED.

33:37.671 --> 33:39.005
‐ MY MOM USED TO SAY,

33:39.047 --> 33:40.715
"THEY SHOULD ALLOW ABORTIONS
UP TO THE TENTH YEAR."

33:40.799 --> 33:42.676
‐ [laughs]
YEAH, MY MOM WOULD'VE SAID THAT,

33:42.717 --> 33:43.718
IF SHE DIDN'T THINK
OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE

33:43.802 --> 33:45.053
WOULD BE PISSED AT HER.

33:45.095 --> 33:46.638
‐ I BET YOU WEREN'T
THAT BAD, THOUGH.

33:46.721 --> 33:48.974
‐ [chuckles]

33:49.057 --> 33:50.559
HEY...
‐ HMM?

33:50.600 --> 33:52.727
‐ THANKS FOR STAYING WITH ME.
I APPRECIATE IT.

33:52.811 --> 33:55.105
‐ IT'S YOUR DIME, SWEETIE.

33:55.188 --> 33:56.857
SORRY ABOUT YOUR BOUNCE HOUSE.

33:56.898 --> 34:00.318
‐ EH, YOU COULD STILL
JUMP UP AND DOWN IF YOU WANT.

34:00.402 --> 34:01.403
[door opens]
EVERYBODY'S‐‐

34:01.486 --> 34:03.363
YO, IT'S HIM!

34:03.447 --> 34:05.574
OH, SURPRISE, MAN.
‐ SURPRISE!

34:05.657 --> 34:07.284
‐ HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BRO.

34:07.367 --> 34:09.703
I HAD, LIKE, AT LEAST
SEVEN DOPE STRIPPERS HERE.

34:09.744 --> 34:11.580
‐ [laughs]
‐ JUST BOMB BABES, YOU KNOW‐‐

34:11.663 --> 34:12.789
‐ OH, MY GOD, JOHNNY.

34:12.873 --> 34:15.542
‐ SH‐‐.

34:15.584 --> 34:18.003
‐ I TOLD YOU DON'T THROW ME
NO DAMN PARTY, MAN.

34:18.044 --> 34:19.337
‐ ARE YOU OKAY?
‐ I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

34:19.379 --> 34:21.923
HEY, YO, LOOK AT ME
WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

34:22.007 --> 34:23.467
LOOK AT ME
WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!

34:23.550 --> 34:24.926
YOU GOT NO RESPECT,
YOU HEAR ME?

34:24.968 --> 34:26.970
YOU GOT NO FREAKIN' RESPECT.
‐ GET OFF ME, JOHNNY.

34:27.053 --> 34:28.346
‐ I THINK I SHOULD PROBABLY‐‐
‐ I TRY TO DO SOMETHING

34:28.430 --> 34:29.639
NICE FOR YOU
AND I GET DECKED FOR IT?

34:29.723 --> 34:31.766
‐ NICE? YOU DID IT JUST
TO SPITE ME, MAN!

34:31.850 --> 34:34.519
‐ THIS WASN'T FOR YOU, JAKES!
THIS WAS FOR EVERYBODY!

34:34.603 --> 34:37.105
‐ LISTEN UP, I DON'T
GIVE A DAMN ABOUT EVERYBODY.

34:37.147 --> 34:38.607
‐ I'M GONNA GO.
‐ YOU DON'T WANT US?

34:38.648 --> 34:40.442
YOU GONNA PISS ON THE ONE GOOD
THING YOU GOT IN YOUR LIFE?

34:40.484 --> 34:44.362
‐ I'M NOT PLAYING.
GET OFF OF ME.

34:44.404 --> 34:46.573
‐ YOU AIN'T GOT
NOTHING ELSE, BRO.

35:00.712 --> 35:01.963
[door slams]

35:11.890 --> 35:14.726
HEY, ALL Y'ALL, LISTEN UP!

35:17.103 --> 35:18.897
HEY, YOU KNOW, NONE OF US
ASKED TO BE HERE,

35:18.980 --> 35:22.025
BUT, DAMN IT, HERE WE ARE.

35:22.108 --> 35:23.652
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
ALL RUN AROUND

35:23.693 --> 35:26.446
PRETENDING LIKE WE'RE NOT
FAMILY, BUT GUESS WHAT?

35:26.530 --> 35:30.116
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL SIX PEOPLE
ALL LIVING IN ONE HOUSE!

35:34.287 --> 35:38.583
[sighs]
DAMN IT, GUYS.

35:38.625 --> 35:41.294
WE GOT A JOB
WHERE, EVERY FREAKIN' DAY,

35:41.336 --> 35:42.921
WE'RE OUT THERE
PLAYING BOSOM BUDDIES

35:42.963 --> 35:46.299
WITH KILLERS
AND DRUG DEALERS.

35:46.341 --> 35:48.802
SO EXCUSE THE HELL
OUT OF ME

35:48.844 --> 35:51.513
IF I'M LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE
TO FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT!

35:57.561 --> 36:00.480
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?

36:15.328 --> 36:16.371
[buzzer]

36:16.454 --> 36:18.623
[indistinct PA announcement]

36:18.665 --> 36:20.166
[phone beeps]

36:22.335 --> 36:25.797
[phone rings]

36:28.091 --> 36:29.259
‐ HELLO.
‐ COLLECT CALL

36:29.342 --> 36:30.719
FROM L. A. COUNTY
DETENTION CENTER.

36:30.802 --> 36:33.013
DO YOU ACCEPT THE CHARGES?

36:35.390 --> 36:36.474
‐ MICHAEL.

36:36.558 --> 36:38.184
I'M SURPRISED YOU CAME.

36:38.226 --> 36:39.895
‐ I'M SURPRISED
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

36:39.978 --> 36:41.730
‐ WE ARE BOTH FULL OF SURPRISES,
AREN'T WE?

36:44.065 --> 36:46.735
THE WHITE BOY...

36:46.776 --> 36:51.698
THE RESERVIST MARINE.

36:51.740 --> 36:55.160
WHEN I SAY IT NOW, AT LEAST
MY SLEEP WILL BE MORE RESTFUL.

36:55.201 --> 36:58.204
‐ IN HERE?
I DOUBT IT.

36:58.246 --> 37:03.418
‐ I STILL SEE EDDIE
AT NIGHT.

37:03.501 --> 37:06.463
WE CAME TO
THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER.

37:06.546 --> 37:10.717
HE WAS MY ONLY FRIEND,
AND I HIS.

37:10.759 --> 37:12.928
ALL THIS TIME,
I THOUGHT I'D KILLED HIM.

37:13.011 --> 37:16.056
‐ YOU DID‐‐
YOU PUT A GUN IN HIS HAND,

37:16.097 --> 37:17.599
AND YOU TOLD HIM
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

37:17.641 --> 37:19.476
‐ NO. NO.
NO!

37:19.559 --> 37:21.102
[clatter]

37:25.440 --> 37:27.692
NO.
YOU KILLED HIM.

37:27.776 --> 37:31.154
HE WAS A HUMAN SACRIFICE

37:31.237 --> 37:33.406
AT THE ALTAR
OF YOUR SACRED BADGE.

37:33.490 --> 37:34.783
‐ THAT'S ABSURD.

37:34.866 --> 37:37.035
‐ WHERE WERE YOU WHEN DRUGS
WERE BEING DEALT?

37:37.077 --> 37:41.414
OR WHEN MEN WERE
TORTURED AND KILLED?

37:41.498 --> 37:45.085
YOU DID NOT STOP ME BECAUSE
IT DID NOT SERVE YOUR PURPOSES.

37:45.126 --> 37:48.922
‐ I WANTED TO STOP YOU.
BUT I HAD ORDERS.

37:48.964 --> 37:50.215
‐ ORDERS.
‐ MM.

37:50.256 --> 37:51.967
‐
MY MEN FOLLOW ORDERS TOO.

37:52.050 --> 37:54.511
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME

37:54.594 --> 37:56.346
IS THAT I WILL
PAY FOR MY SINS.

38:01.184 --> 38:04.479
WE ARE DONE HERE.

38:04.521 --> 38:06.523
[chains rattling]

38:17.158 --> 38:20.412
‐ YO, BRIGGS.
‐ HEY, YO, WHAT'S UP?

38:20.453 --> 38:23.456
‐ WE GOTTA TALK.

38:25.583 --> 38:27.711
‐ SOUNDS SERIOUS.
HIT ME.

38:27.794 --> 38:30.463
‐ [sighs]

38:32.382 --> 38:35.593
I'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING YOU
FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS.

38:35.677 --> 38:38.179
‐ HMM.

38:38.263 --> 38:39.681
‐ YOU'RE NOT SURPRISED?

38:39.723 --> 38:42.267
‐ MM, YOU KNOW,
TOP OF YOUR CLASS AT QUANTICO.

38:42.350 --> 38:43.560
SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE
TO WRITE A TICKET

38:43.643 --> 38:44.561
TO WHATEVER DETAIL
YOU WANTED.

38:44.644 --> 38:45.729
INSTEAD, YOU ENDED UP HERE.

38:45.812 --> 38:49.024
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.

38:49.065 --> 38:53.653
‐ NOW, IF I WAS
A GOOD DETECTIVE,

38:53.695 --> 38:55.655
I WOULD ASK YOU,

38:55.739 --> 38:57.407
WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME I WAS HERE
TO INVESTIGATE YOU?

38:57.490 --> 39:00.326
‐ BUT YOU ARE
A GOOD DETECTIVE, MICHAEL,

39:00.368 --> 39:01.786
WHICH IS WHY
YOU'VE UNCOVERED

39:01.828 --> 39:03.705
MY PENCHANT FOR
POWDERED OPIOIDS, RIGHT?

39:03.788 --> 39:05.915
‐ WHICH PRETTY MUCH CONFIRMED
THE INVESTIGATION, YEAH.

39:05.999 --> 39:09.169
‐ YEAH.
PRETTY MUCH DID.

39:09.210 --> 39:11.463
SO I'VE GOT TO ASK...

39:11.504 --> 39:13.840
WHAT DID YOU TURN UP?

39:13.882 --> 39:15.675
‐ JUST THAT.

39:15.717 --> 39:17.135
‐ YOU'VE TOLD ME NOW.

39:17.218 --> 39:19.054
I ASSUME THAT MEANS THAT
THE INVESTIGATION IS OVER, YEAH?

39:19.137 --> 39:22.515
‐ I WISH IT WAS.
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

39:30.148 --> 39:32.233
THE AGENT THAT GAVE ME
THIS ASSIGNMENT, HE'S MISSING.

39:32.275 --> 39:34.152
‐ "MISSING."

39:34.235 --> 39:35.737
‐ AND CLARKE THINKS
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.

39:35.820 --> 39:38.615
‐ I'M NOT IN THE AGENT
DISAPPEARING BUSINESS, MIKE.

39:38.698 --> 39:40.158
‐ I KNOW THAT.
THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING YOU.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.659
‐ HE WANTS YOU TO PROVE THIS?

39:41.701 --> 39:43.244
‐ YEAH, THEY THINK HE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN WEARING A WIRE,

39:43.328 --> 39:47.373
AND THAT THE DISAPPEARANCE
MIGHT BE ON A TAPE IN HIS CAR.

39:47.457 --> 39:49.000
‐ OKAY, GOOD.
WELL, WHAT'S YOUR S. O.'S NAME?

39:49.042 --> 39:51.086
‐ JUAN BADILLO.

39:51.169 --> 39:52.629
‐ I'VE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF THE GUY.

39:55.507 --> 39:58.635
‐ BRIGGS, I'M GONNA START
LOOKING FOR THIS CAR.

39:58.718 --> 40:00.637
I'D REALLY LOVE YOUR HELP.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.181
‐ NO.

40:03.264 --> 40:04.307
NO, IT'D LOOK
LIKE A COVER UP, MIKE.

40:04.390 --> 40:07.143
‐ [sighs] RIGHT.

40:09.395 --> 40:14.067
STILL...

40:14.109 --> 40:15.068
I'M SORRY.

40:15.110 --> 40:18.822
‐ THANKS FOR TELLING ME...

40:18.905 --> 40:20.740
EVEN IF IT WAS
A FEW MONTHS LATE.

40:25.453 --> 40:27.914
‐ [grunts]

40:35.797 --> 40:39.384
‐ YOU THINK ODIN ROSSI IS...
IS AN FBI AGENT?

40:39.467 --> 40:41.886
‐ YEAH.
I MEAN, I HAD MY SUSPICIONS,

40:41.970 --> 40:43.513
BUT NOW I'M
PRETTY DAMN CERTAIN.

40:43.596 --> 40:46.432
‐ IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME
I SEE CORRUPT POLICE.

40:46.474 --> 40:49.894
‐ I FOUND THIS
IN THE HOTEL ROOM.

40:49.978 --> 40:52.480
IT'S GOT A LITTLE PINHOLE CAMERA
WITH A VIDEO TRANSMITTER.

40:56.109 --> 40:57.694
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK,
YOU KNOW...

40:57.777 --> 40:59.112
ODIN SCREWS OVER CAZA.

40:59.154 --> 41:00.697
THEY SEND JANGLES
TO COME AND GET HIM.

41:00.780 --> 41:03.658
HE PUTS THAT IN A HOTEL ROOM,
TRIES TO PUT A FACE TO THE NAME.

41:03.741 --> 41:05.785
‐ THIS PLAN WAS‐‐
WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?

41:05.827 --> 41:07.412
DID HE PUT A NAME
TO THE FACE?

41:07.453 --> 41:09.622
‐ I MEAN, I PULLED THE PLUG
RIGHT BEFORE YOU GOT THERE,

41:09.664 --> 41:12.667
SO IF JANGLES GOT THERE
BEFORE US,

41:12.750 --> 41:14.127
THEN HE SAW HIS FACE.

41:14.169 --> 41:17.172
‐ IF WE FIND
THIS DIRTY FBI AGENT,

41:17.255 --> 41:21.467
PERHAPS HE COULD LEAD ME
TO JANGLES, <i>SI?</i>

41:21.509 --> 41:23.553
THIS AGENT,
WHAT IS HIS NAME?

41:26.556 --> 41:29.851
‐ I DON'T HAVE A NAME.

41:29.934 --> 41:31.436
‐ OKAY, WELL,
TELL ME WHEN YOU DO,

41:31.519 --> 41:32.729
BECAUSE I CAN HELP YOU.

41:32.812 --> 41:33.938
‐ OF COURSE YOU'LL HELP ME.

41:34.022 --> 41:35.356
WE'RE IN THIS HUNT
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

41:35.398 --> 41:37.692
‐ YEAH. PERFECT.

41:37.734 --> 41:41.112
SO...HOW DO WE PROCEED?

41:46.284 --> 41:50.205
‐ SO WHY DID YOU TELL BRIGGS
YOU WERE INVESTIGATING HIM?

41:55.210 --> 41:57.795
‐ I TOLD BRIGGS BECAUSE I WANTED
TO SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE

41:57.837 --> 41:59.214
WHEN I SAID THE NAME
"JUAN BADILLO."

41:59.297 --> 42:02.634
‐ AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?

42:02.717 --> 42:04.427
‐ HE HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS.

42:42.382 --> 42:44.759
[dog barking]
