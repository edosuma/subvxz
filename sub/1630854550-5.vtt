01:24.760 --> 01:26.560
NICK: Philby didn't escape.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.040
I let him go.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.040
Why did I let him go?

01:36.080 --> 01:41.200
Because I'm trained in,
shall we say, exigent circumstances,

01:41.240 --> 01:43.600
to consider myself above the law.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.440
You can come in now, Mrs Thomas.

01:49.440 --> 01:53.920
Because all of us at SIS
have been raised since the year dot

01:53.960 --> 01:58.080
to believe we belong
to a higher order.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.000
A different set of rules.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.720
Tell Sir Roger that.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.160
A higher order?

02:08.240 --> 02:12.080
The aim is to draw Sir Roger out
and force him to defend himself,

02:12.120 --> 02:14.440
so tell them I let Philby go

02:14.480 --> 02:16.920
to save SIS from a public trial
that would've...

02:16.960 --> 02:21.560
..that would've inflicted
more harm on the country than good.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.800
And then wait for them
to address the elephant in the room.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.000
It's a nice day.
Lovely.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.120
And what if they don't?

02:48.760 --> 02:50.480
They will.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.840
Sir Roger will.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.000
We believe Elliott
has found out about Blunt.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.120
We believe Elliott
has found out about Blunt.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.600
You believe or know for certain?

03:09.960 --> 03:12.440
Did you know they had lunch
at Elliott's club yesterday?

03:12.480 --> 03:14.080
No, I did not.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.280
SHE CLEARS THROAT

03:26.920 --> 03:29.640
While I'm doing this,
what are you gonna be doing?

03:32.680 --> 03:36.960
The time has now come for us to use
Jim Angleton to our advantage.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.720
How do you know
Elliott found out about Sir Anthony?

03:42.760 --> 03:46.360
How do you not know?
SIS must have told him.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.920
SIS have no idea.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.640
The source was Michael Straight,
to the Americans,

03:51.680 --> 03:56.640
who passed it on to us at MI5,
and us alone, not SIS.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.760
You seem sceptical, Mrs Thomas.
Of the Americans?

03:59.800 --> 04:00.000
Unless, of course, it was...

04:00.000 --> 04:03.200
Unless, of course, it was...

04:04.640 --> 04:09.240
..Philby who told Elliott
about Blunt in Beirut.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.280
Possible.

04:10.320 --> 04:14.640
How do you not know that Elliott
and Blunt met for lunch yesterday?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.800
I'm a debriefer, sir, not a watcher.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.640
Wasn't it you who suggested
we let him off the lead,

04:19.680 --> 04:26.160
I think is the phrase you used,
so that we... You could watch him?

04:30.480 --> 04:31.960
Mrs Thomas?

04:34.760 --> 04:36.560
Yes.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.040
He wants to meet in person.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.080
I was told this is urgent.

we hopped over the garden railings.

You didn't answer the bell so
we hopped over the garden railings.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.640
Or more accurately, I hopped.
Jim made a bit of a meal of it.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.040
We figured that you might like
some company.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.960
Jim's heading back to America
in the morning

08:44.000 --> 08:47.520
so we thought we could,
you know, make a night of it.

08:47.560 --> 08:51.320
Between us, I'm off to Rome
for a few days first.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
Lovely service today,
don't you think?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.600
Very.

I knew you'd do this.
Cirrhosis, they said.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.640
You cannot blame yourself, Kim.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.120
The sad truth is...

09:19.520 --> 09:24.040
..both you chaps know me far better
than she ever did.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.560
No, I doubt that.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.440
As a matter of interest...

09:35.000 --> 09:38.560
..who, outside our small circle
of friends,

09:38.600 --> 09:42.360
have you ever revealed
your real self to?

09:50.240 --> 09:53.840
"Shall I part my hair behind?"
Oh, God, here we go.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.320
"Do I dare to eat a peach?"

09:56.360 --> 09:57.640
You two and your bloody poetry!

09:57.680 --> 10:00.000
Heathen.
We're to lift his spirits, remember?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.800
Heathen.
We're to lift his spirits, remember?

10:06.720 --> 10:08.360

10:08.400 --> 10:10.640
Business or pleasure?

10:10.680 --> 10:13.240
The Bolsheviks

10:14.800 --> 10:19.120

for an answer and nor would you.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.200
A higher order?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.320
His words, not mine.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.560
Late night?
Early morning.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.240
Do you ever wear make-up?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.840
Er, not really, no.
Hm.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.440
Any particular reason?

10:45.480 --> 10:48.080
Er, I just never have.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.400
Why?
Hm.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.000
As a matter of interest,
why is it, do you suppose,

11:00.000 --> 11:01.320
As a matter of interest,
why is it, do you suppose,

11:01.360 --> 11:04.560
that of all
the debriefers in the building

11:04.600 --> 11:07.360
you were the one
assigned to Nicholas Elliott?

11:07.400 --> 11:10.400
I don't know.
To get under his skin, I suppose.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.480
Because you're a woman.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.440
Er, the opposite of posh.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.240
An affront
to the gentlemen spies of SIS.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.280
I told Sir Roger that you were
the right person for this

11:24.320 --> 11:25.840
because you're good at what you do.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.000
Thank you.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.000
And I thought Nick Elliott
might find you intriguing.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.040
And I thought Nick Elliott
might find you intriguing.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.000
Hm. Intriguing.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.760
What are you not telling us, Lily?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.560
Nothing...

11:49.720 --> 11:50.920
..ma'am.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.680
Hm.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.000
It's not that a spot of rouge
and mascara

12:00.040 --> 12:01.840
necessarily make one a better liar,

12:01.880 --> 12:05.800
but... sometimes they can help
hide the truth.

12:07.040 --> 12:12.760
Honestly, I'm not sure
what I know and do not know as yet.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.000
Well...

12:16.640 --> 12:19.240
..Sir Roger is taking you
off the case.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.080
Why?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.840
He says you look tired.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.480
I've not been... It's barely been...

12:35.520 --> 12:38.920
Er, and he couldn't tell me that
to my face?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.760
So that's it?

12:47.880 --> 12:49.840
Nothing more to be done?

12:51.200 --> 12:53.000
Officially, no.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.400
Unofficially?

13:00.120 --> 13:03.400
They call that one Shimmering Rose.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.080
Best bacon and egg roll in the land.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.040
Do you mind?

13:58.400 --> 14:01.720
First, as they say in cowboy films,
I come in peace.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.880
How.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.400
No need to explain
the bug in my house.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.320
Kim did a bunk to Moscow, CIA
got wind and suspect I helped him,

14:10.360 --> 14:12.880
so you said you'd come to London
and have a bit of a poke about.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.080
It's all to be expected.
That's very sporting of you.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.880
But I'll wager you skipped the part
about why you really came here.

14:23.640 --> 14:28.800
To be in radio frequency range
with your people in Moscow.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.960
I don't run joes in the field
any more, Nick.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.000
I'm management now.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.120
Hm. So I gather.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.040
The KGB raided a flat in Moscow
last night.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.440
The man surrendered
but the woman went down fighting.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.520
Your people?

14:58.840 --> 15:00.640
She's dead, Jim.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.320
Kim is a traitor.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.160
A double agent for the KGB.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.680
Has been for 30 years.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.520
Had me fooled
since we first met in 1940,

15:49.560 --> 15:52.360
and you since right after
Pearl Harbor.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.880
As painful as that is...

15:58.360 --> 16:02.040
..it's important that we finally
come to terms

16:02.080 --> 16:04.880
with the cold, hard fact
that one of our own,

16:04.920 --> 16:08.320
whom we loved,
respected and admired,

16:08.360 --> 16:11.240
to the point of, dare I say it,
hero worship...

16:13.560 --> 16:16.000
..has done the unthinkable.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.680
Hero worship?

16:28.360 --> 16:30.320
Speak for yourself.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.200
I am. Believe me.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.520
Go back to Washington. Today.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.800
Cover your tracks in Moscow
if you can...

16:52.880 --> 16:53.000
..and destroy all evidence
of your blind faith in Kim.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.400
..and destroy all evidence
of your blind faith in Kim.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.240
And then we need
never speak of this again.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.680
What about you, Nick?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.440
What are you doing
to redeem yourself?

18:03.960 --> 18:05.760
Fuck!

18:17.520 --> 18:20.120
Give me a light.
What happened?

18:20.160 --> 18:23.000
Do you have a fucking light or not?

Well, here's to her, anyway.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.680
And to my mother.

18:57.600 --> 19:02.640
And Aileen,
the mother of my children.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.360
God rest her soul.

Thank you.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.800
Close the door, please.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.440
I'm sorry, you'll have to remind me
of your name again.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.800
Martin.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.320
That's right, Martin. Martin what?

19:50.360 --> 19:53.000
Arthur Martin.
Ah. Martin's your surname.

19:53.000 --> 19:53.480
Arthur Martin.
Ah. Martin's your surname.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.960
Mrs Thomas is no longer assigned
to your case.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.960
May I ask why?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.400
Not your concern.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.840
Aren't you a tad senior
to be the messenger?

20:06.880 --> 20:09.200
I've come to talk to you
about Sir Anthony Blunt.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.160
Was it your decision
to replace Mrs Thomas?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.720
Sir Roger's.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.920
Women, eh?
Quite.

20:19.400 --> 20:23.000
I wasn't aware I'm a "case."
Pull up a pew. Cup of tea?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.600
I wasn't aware I'm a "case."
Pull up a pew. Cup of tea?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.040
No, thank you, I'm fine.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.640
Sit.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.360
I'm sure Mrs Thomas
probably warned you,

20:36.400 --> 20:38.600
I like to take a moment or two
to break the ice.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.960
I understand you recently had lunch
with Sir Anthony Blunt.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.120
At my club.

20:47.160 --> 20:52.040
Beef Wellington.
Must have been... Thursday. Yeah.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.000
What was the reason for this lunch?

20:53.000 --> 20:53.720
What was the reason for this lunch?

20:53.760 --> 20:55.800
Although I think
he ordered the fish.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.320
Reason? Er, Vermeer.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.800
Beg your pardon?

21:00.840 --> 21:03.800
Artist. Dutch. Dab hand
with perspective, all that.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.880
Mr Elliott,

21:04.920 --> 21:08.200
may I remind you I'm here
under the authority of the minister.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.200
Fine.

21:12.840 --> 21:18.360
Sir Anthony Blunt. Formerly of MI5,
and now, as we know, the KGB.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.080
Allegedly.
Are you defending him?

21:21.120 --> 21:23.000
No. I'm just saying.
Because he's MI5.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.120
No. I'm just saying.
Because he's MI5.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.000
Ex MI5.

21:29.560 --> 21:35.520
Just as when you, at MI5, took it
upon yourselves to investigate us

21:35.560 --> 21:38.160
here at SIS
for our handling of Kim Philby...

21:38.200 --> 21:40.160
As ordered by the Home Secretary.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.400
..whom do you suppose
it might fall to

21:42.440 --> 21:46.200
to examine MI5's handling of Blunt?

21:47.320 --> 21:50.640
Let me be very clear,
whatever it is you are hiding,

21:50.680 --> 21:52.800
whatever it is you are up to,

21:52.840 --> 21:53.000
you are under no circumstances to go
anywhere near Sir Anthony again.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.240
you are under no circumstances to go
anywhere near Sir Anthony again.

22:00.480 --> 22:04.800
Ten years ago, when we shared
source intelligence with you

22:04.840 --> 22:11.600
about a possible Soviet penetration
agent at MI5, you personally -

22:11.640 --> 22:13.760
Of course I remember
your sodding name,

22:13.800 --> 22:17.360
how could I fucking well forget it?
- were responsible for the inquiry

22:17.400 --> 22:20.600
that completely overlooked
and missed Blunt.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.000
So I beg to differ
that it's not my concern.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.280
So I beg to differ
that it's not my concern.

22:25.320 --> 22:28.000
In fact,
I'm rather glad you dropped by.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.920
Are you sure I can't offer you
a cup of tea?

22:57.320 --> 22:59.600
Would you get hold of Mrs Thomas
for me, please?

22:59.640 --> 23:01.840
However, to many at the time

23:01.880 --> 23:04.880
Francesco Borromini
was regarded as sacrilegious

23:04.920 --> 23:09.200
in the world of early 17th century
Italian architecture,

23:09.240 --> 23:13.160
and accused of suborning
the laws of the ancients

23:13.200 --> 23:16.040
with chaos and disorder.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.640
Such is art, ladies and gentlemen.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.000
All I can say is thank God
for those few so-called heretics

23:23.000 --> 23:24.040
All I can say is thank God
for those few so-called heretics

23:24.080 --> 23:29.160
who insisted that Borromini,
and not, in fact, Bernini,

23:29.200 --> 23:33.560
is the greatest genius
of Baroque architecture.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.000
Bloody Yanks. Look at that.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.320
You've gotta take your hat off
to them.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.440
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

25:10.480 --> 25:15.360
That I have genuine admiration
for American ingenuity?

25:15.400 --> 25:19.040
Sometimes I think this is all
just some endless game to you.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.440
You say that...

25:26.480 --> 25:28.920
as though...

25:28.960 --> 25:31.640
you've never been
a player of the game yourself.

25:31.680 --> 25:35.120
That was in the war, when
things were anything but a game.

over two hours ago now,

25:47.960 --> 25:50.920
and her home number is off the hook.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.000

25:56.280 --> 25:58.360
What's wrong?
Nothing.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.480
I'm worried that in your desperation
to repair all the damage Kim's done,

26:02.520 --> 26:04.840
you're in danger
of making things worse.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.320
Desperation?

26:06.360 --> 26:08.600
Only a minute ago you were saying
it was all just a game!

26:11.200 --> 26:12.720
Kiss me.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.160
What's that for?

26:23.400 --> 26:25.560
Does there have to be a reason?

26:27.040 --> 26:30.200
Did you have a good day?
Not too bad.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.680
We had to give our vaccines
to King's Hospital, so...

26:35.560 --> 26:37.920
You know.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.560
When he got to the airport,
rather than fly back to America,

28:19.600 --> 28:22.080
he gets in another car
that was waiting for him there,

28:22.120 --> 28:24.360
and drives north
for an hour and a half.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.840

28:26.880 --> 28:28.600

thought from feeling,

No.

Oh, she stays.

you care about what happens to Kim.

Yep. I'll get it.

Your head would be the first to
roll, of that you can be certain.

What instructions were you given in
the event of your cover being blown?

45:49.960 --> 45:51.000
I have no instructions.
There were none.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.160
I have no instructions.
There were none.

45:53.440 --> 45:57.000
I should warn you that in
the greater scheme of things...

..I don't give a damn how much
my exposing you as a Soviet spy

46:01.160 --> 46:03.440

46:03.480 --> 46:06.280
I have had no contact with
Russian intelligence since 1945.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.240
After you helped them defeat...
No glasses, I'm afraid.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.360
You'll have to drink out of the tap.
It's fine.

46:12.400 --> 46:16.600
Is Her Majesty aware of your work
for Russian intelligence?

46:16.640 --> 46:19.200
I don't think
I need to dignify that.

46:19.240 --> 46:20.360
No.

46:20.400 --> 46:21.000
You absolutely do.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.240
You absolutely do.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.080
Or should I toss you back
to the Americans?

46:29.360 --> 46:31.720
Of course she isn't aware.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
My instructions
were to go to Hollis.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.800
And do what?
Inform him that I was blown.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.200
What's he supposed to do about it?
That I don't know.

46:45.240 --> 46:48.080
But you were told he might help?
So I understood, yes.

46:48.120 --> 46:50.520
How did he react when you told him?
Hard to say.

46:50.560 --> 46:51.000
What did he tell you to do?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.120
What did he tell you to do?

46:52.160 --> 46:55.400
Nothing. He told me to do nothing
until he got back to me.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.680
Who is your KGB handler?
I don't have a handler.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.640
So who told you to go to Hollis?

47:12.280 --> 47:14.000
Philby.

47:45.640 --> 47:47.560
Fuck off, I said!

47:47.600 --> 47:51.000
Come on, Kim. I'm taking you home.

47:51.000 --> 47:51.080
Come on, Kim. I'm taking you home.

47:51.120 --> 47:54.160
I have no home, thanks to you.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.720
Kim. Come.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.720
Kim!

47:59.760 --> 48:02.520
Kim!

48:02.560 --> 48:06.440
GRUNTING

48:12.560 --> 48:14.200
Kim!

48:20.240 --> 48:21.000
INDISTINCT

48:21.000 --> 48:22.080
INDISTINCT

48:24.320 --> 48:27.480
GROANING

48:43.280 --> 48:47.240
PANTING

48:58.360 --> 48:59.720
Silly arse.

49:08.040 --> 49:11.000
NURSE: Mne nuzhno, chtoby ty yego

49:28.160 --> 49:30.160

49:40.080 --> 49:41.840
What are you doing up?

50:04.520 --> 50:06.000
Hello, Nick.

50:10.760 --> 50:12.520
Sir Roger!
