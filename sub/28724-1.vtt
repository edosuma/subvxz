WEBVTT

01:47.863 --> 01:48.930
Jon.

02:19.783 --> 02:22.254
Do you know why we
wanna talk to you, Jon?

02:23.767 --> 02:25.369
I don't know,

02:26.318 --> 02:27.877
I think so.

02:28.921 --> 02:31.148
Why do you think I
wanna talk to you?

02:32.903 --> 02:34.427
About that boy.

02:35.467 --> 02:38.951
- Yes?
- Because someone took him and killed him.

02:38.952 --> 02:40.090
Yes.

02:40.091 --> 02:43.184
It wasn't me, I never
went to Bootle Strand.

02:43.403 --> 02:45.577
Well we're not gonna
talk about that just now.

02:46.087 --> 02:48.539
First we're gonna talk
about something else.

02:50.292 --> 02:52.323
Do you know what truth is, Jon?

02:52.912 --> 02:53.979
Yeah.

02:55.362 --> 02:58.874
Go on, you tell
us what you think truth is.

03:00.866 --> 03:04.624
That you've done
something and it's true.

03:05.805 --> 03:08.078
And what if you
were telling lies?

03:11.616 --> 03:12.816
I don't know.

03:14.267 --> 03:16.395
Is telling lies wrong?

03:16.396 --> 03:20.378
- Yeah.
- So if I said that your face is green

03:20.379 --> 03:23.254
and your hair is pink,
would that be a lie?

03:23.583 --> 03:24.764
Yeah.

03:24.765 --> 03:27.749
Okay, so you know what a lie is.

04:03.453 --> 04:06.874
Robert, you've seen the
pictures on TV

04:06.875 --> 04:10.593
showing James and the two boys
who took him, haven't you?

04:11.585 --> 04:15.280
Yeah, it isn't me
'cause I didn't take him.

04:15.905 --> 04:17.333
Well there's a boy in the video

04:17.334 --> 04:19.438
who has a jacket
just like yours.

04:20.037 --> 04:22.451
There's lots of jackets
the same as mine.

04:22.919 --> 04:26.812
Well there's also a boy with a jacket
like Jon's walking next to James.

04:27.224 --> 04:29.372
Well, he's not walking with me.

04:29.926 --> 04:31.856
But you were there, weren't you?

04:32.504 --> 04:34.553
Yeah, I was there.

04:34.754 --> 04:37.418
I saw him but I didn't take him.

04:40.727 --> 04:42.390
What was he doing?

04:42.391 --> 04:46.117
He was just with his mum,
he had a blue coat.

04:51.929 --> 04:53.811
I think, Jon, you
should know that Robert

04:53.812 --> 04:55.538
is at Walton Lane police station

04:55.812 --> 04:58.647
and he's told a different story
of what happened on Friday.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.304
Robert probably told lies.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.316
What do you think
Robert lied about?

05:04.842 --> 05:08.217
I don't know, you
think I killed the kid?

05:08.451 --> 05:10.496
No, they don't think that, Jon.

05:10.497 --> 05:12.207
There's no need to get upset.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.145
No one's saying that, Jon.

05:14.809 --> 05:16.917
They just want to
know where you've been.

05:16.918 --> 05:19.893
If you've been robbing all
day, you should tell them.

05:19.894 --> 05:22.362
I never went to Bootle Strand.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.277
Now is that the truth or a lie?

05:24.511 --> 05:25.784
The truth.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.244
Jon told me earlier that Robert

05:28.245 --> 05:30.042
was going to tell
all kinds of lies.

05:30.651 --> 05:33.042
Robbie took me to
places I didn't know.

05:33.479 --> 05:34.946
He's frightened
because he doesn't know

05:34.947 --> 05:37.002
all the places and Robert does.

05:38.744 --> 05:40.862
Was it the Bootle Strand?

05:40.863 --> 05:43.847
No. - You see, Robert says
that he was with you

05:44.144 --> 05:46.666
and that you were indeed in
Bootle New Strand together.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.775
- We wasn't.
- Robert says you were.

05:48.776 --> 05:51.696
Yeah, we was but we
never saw any kids there,

05:51.697 --> 05:53.204
we never robbed any kids.

05:53.205 --> 05:55.071
So you were in
Bootle New Strand?

05:55.072 --> 05:56.360
Was you at Bootle Strand?

05:56.361 --> 06:00.805
Yeah, but we never got a
kid, mum, we never got a kid.

06:00.806 --> 06:04.180
Mrs. Venables, would you, I must
ask you not to get angry with him.

06:04.181 --> 06:06.437
We never got a kid,
mum, we never,

06:06.438 --> 06:08.687
we saw those lads
together, we did,

06:08.688 --> 06:11.796
we never got a kid, mum,
mum, we never got a kid,

06:11.797 --> 06:15.523
you think we did, we never,
mum, we never.

06:22.343 --> 06:24.295
I think you saw more of James

06:24.296 --> 06:25.865
because you wouldn't
remember a blue coat

06:25.866 --> 06:27.873
- from a brief glance.
- I never took him.

06:28.249 --> 06:29.849
Well, we believe that you left

06:29.850 --> 06:31.639
with baby James and with Jon.

06:32.076 --> 06:34.365
- Says who?
- We say.

06:34.631 --> 06:37.021
No, I never left with him.

06:38.436 --> 06:40.514
Well, tell me
what happened then.

06:41.242 --> 06:42.842
I never touched him.

06:44.784 --> 06:46.330
I never touched him.

06:46.643 --> 06:48.737
That's why you noticed
his anorak,

06:49.198 --> 06:51.862
because Jon had hold of
his hand, isn't that right?

06:55.028 --> 06:58.035
Yeah, Jon grabbed
hold of the baby's hand

06:58.036 --> 07:00.200
and just walked around
with him for a bit,

07:00.559 --> 07:02.601
but then he let him go loose.

07:03.004 --> 07:04.816
Where did Jon let him go?

07:05.191 --> 07:06.424
By the church.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.119
I told Jon to take him back.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.556
Well I have a statement
from a woman

07:09.557 --> 07:12.944
who said she saw two boys
with a baby on the reservoir.

07:13.525 --> 07:15.924
Now I think that's you
and Jon with James.

07:17.784 --> 07:19.510
What happened to him?

07:20.190 --> 07:22.323
We just found him at
the bottom of the hill.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.204
Did he have a fall?

07:24.205 --> 07:26.158
That's a bad bruise.

07:26.619 --> 07:28.578
He was like that when
we found him.

07:28.579 --> 07:31.464
You'd best take him to
Walton Lace Police Station,

07:31.465 --> 07:32.730
do you know where it is?

07:32.731 --> 07:34.631
Yeah, we'll bring him now.

07:47.783 --> 07:50.571
If you knew that I
went to Bootle Strand--

07:50.572 --> 07:52.742
I would have strangled you, yeah.

07:52.743 --> 07:56.336
And wouldn't you have thought
I'd killed a kid, I never--

07:56.828 --> 07:58.898
I'd never think that.

07:59.281 --> 08:02.631
Because, because
I would have told,

08:02.632 --> 08:04.842
because I thought
you'd think I done it.

08:05.655 --> 08:07.662
If I would have known
all this now, Jon,

08:08.506 --> 08:11.203
I would have had you down
the police station right away

08:12.216 --> 08:14.419
instead of them banging
on my front door

08:14.420 --> 08:16.794
making a show of me
in the streets.

08:17.552 --> 08:18.802
But I,

08:19.893 --> 08:22.185
I thought you'd think I killed him.

08:59.391 --> 09:02.120
We just found him, he
was lost at the Strand.

09:02.602 --> 09:04.823
We're bringing him to
the police station now.

09:05.039 --> 09:06.759
If you found him by the Strand,

09:06.760 --> 09:09.369
why didn't you bring him to the
police station by the Strand?

09:09.931 --> 09:13.587
We were bringing him to
Walton Lane Police Station.

09:14.423 --> 09:18.329
Well, you've come an awfully long way from
the Strand to Walton Lane Police Station.

09:18.532 --> 09:20.873
Well, that's where
the man directed us.

09:20.874 --> 09:22.240
Where do you live?

09:23.274 --> 09:25.492
The police station
is on the way home.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.908
Are you all right?

09:31.506 --> 09:33.654
We'll bring him to
the police station.

09:34.795 --> 09:36.481
Would you mind looking
after my little girl

09:36.482 --> 09:38.137
while I take him to the station?

09:38.138 --> 09:41.226
Oh, my dog doesn't
like children,

09:41.458 --> 09:43.728
he's afraid of them, sorry.

09:44.364 --> 09:47.108
Okay, boys, do you know
which way you're going?

09:47.109 --> 09:48.801
Yeah, we know.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.696
Are you sure you know the way?

09:53.697 --> 09:55.663
I'll go that way, missus.

10:08.643 --> 10:11.229
So, you did leave
with James then?

10:12.034 --> 10:14.494
Yeah, we went to the Strand

10:14.495 --> 10:15.985
and we picked up
little James up.

10:15.986 --> 10:18.260
Well, he, Jon did.

10:18.840 --> 10:19.885
Right.

10:20.213 --> 10:22.844
Then we took him down
and left him on the How.

10:22.845 --> 10:24.111
On the How?

10:24.603 --> 10:25.875
By the railway.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.711
Why did you leave James there?

10:28.040 --> 10:29.757
'Cause if we took him
to the police station,

10:29.758 --> 10:34.109
then we'd have to go inside. He wasn't
crying anymore, he was just looking around,

10:34.492 --> 10:36.247
he'd only had a graze.

10:37.257 --> 10:39.232
Now, would you
have left baby Ben,

10:39.233 --> 10:41.467
your brother there,
if he was two?

10:42.193 --> 10:44.295
No, 'cause he's my brother.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.732
And would you have
left a similar boy?

10:47.099 --> 10:50.342
He's not, though, he's
not any relation to us.

10:51.621 --> 10:53.629
Mum, is Jon getting asked this?

10:54.973 --> 10:57.511
Robert says that you
took James by the hand

10:57.512 --> 10:59.542
and led him out out to
the Strand shops.

10:59.543 --> 11:02.464
- We never, we never--
- No, not we,

11:02.465 --> 11:04.471
Robert is saying that
you took him by the hand.

11:04.472 --> 11:07.777
- We never.
- Not Robert, you did it.

11:07.778 --> 11:10.128
- I never.
- Well, why would Robert say that about you?

11:10.129 --> 11:11.151
He's a liar!

11:11.152 --> 11:13.604
- All right, come on love, you tell them the truth.
- I never took him

11:13.605 --> 11:16.254
by the hand, I never
even touched the baby.

11:16.519 --> 11:18.714
- Jon, are you all right to carry on?
- Yeah.

11:18.715 --> 11:20.291
Jon, look at me.

11:21.058 --> 11:24.095
If you want to stop at
anytime, you just say so.

11:24.487 --> 11:26.197
You need to tell the truth, Jon,

11:26.198 --> 11:28.167
because you keep
telling us stories.

11:28.168 --> 11:29.915
I never got the boy.

11:29.916 --> 11:32.587
Well, if you never got the
boy, tell us what happened.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.192
Was it Robert?

11:36.323 --> 11:40.940
- You're nodding your head.
- Yeah, he left him in the road.

11:41.698 --> 11:43.478
Right, well, let's
go back to the Strand.

11:43.479 --> 11:45.974
No, I never touched a boy,
mum, I never.

11:45.975 --> 11:47.041
Okay.

11:49.547 --> 11:51.389
Come here, son, all
right, come on, come on.

11:51.641 --> 11:54.038
- Oh God, no.
- Settle yourself down.

11:54.039 --> 11:56.390
I can't, I never touched him.

11:56.773 --> 11:58.695
Sit down, go to your mum.

11:58.696 --> 12:01.469
All right, all right, you're
going to get me crying now, look.

12:01.470 --> 12:05.605
- I never, mum.
- I know you wouldn't, I know you wouldn't do that to a boy.

12:06.672 --> 12:10.687
All right, well, why don't
you tell us what happened, Jon?

12:10.977 --> 12:12.410
I left Robert on his own.

12:12.968 --> 12:15.835
Tell me the truth,
now Jon, please.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.270
I never killed him, mum,

12:17.271 --> 12:19.849
we took him and left the
canal, mum, that's all.

12:20.084 --> 12:22.256
He left him at the canal,
by the Strand?

12:22.257 --> 12:23.326
Yeah.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.841
Where did you find the
boy in the Strand?

12:24.842 --> 12:27.865
I don't know, he was just
walking around on his own.

12:27.866 --> 12:30.725
I never killed him, mum,
I never killed him, mum,

12:30.726 --> 12:31.997
I wouldn't hurt a baby.

12:31.998 --> 12:33.482
I know you wouldn't hurt a baby.

12:33.483 --> 12:36.599
I wanna go home, I've already
told you what I know.

12:36.958 --> 12:40.075
You're gonna put me in jail,
I never, mum!

12:41.458 --> 12:44.793
I never, I never, I never,
I never, I never, I never.

12:53.246 --> 12:55.800
You see, Robert, if
James was bleeding

12:56.214 --> 12:58.510
and we find his blood on
your clothes or Jon's,

12:58.885 --> 13:01.085
then we'd know that you were
there when he was bleeding.

13:01.378 --> 13:03.596
But how would you know
it was baby James' blood?

13:03.885 --> 13:06.167
We'd know because
we have his body.

13:06.433 --> 13:07.720
Where?

13:07.721 --> 13:09.377
Well, it doesn't matter where,

13:09.947 --> 13:12.151
he's probably been to
the hospital first.

13:12.152 --> 13:13.299
Why?

13:13.830 --> 13:16.767
To take blood from his
arm like they did with you.

13:17.158 --> 13:19.962
They've taken him to
try get him alive again?

13:20.539 --> 13:21.640
No.

13:22.041 --> 13:24.446
No, they can't do that.

13:25.927 --> 13:27.701
I was told he got
chopped in half,

13:28.052 --> 13:30.661
well, he couldn't come
alive again, could he,

13:30.939 --> 13:32.770
if he'd been chopped in half?

13:36.326 --> 13:39.364
The blood might be mine 'cause
I was bleeding from a cut.

13:40.334 --> 13:43.301
Well, you couldn't
do that with your shoe

13:43.724 --> 13:46.076
and the blood has been
found on your shoe.

13:48.909 --> 13:50.809
I never murdered him.

13:51.815 --> 13:54.546
You're just trying to
say that I murdered him.

13:54.994 --> 13:57.287
Why aren't you
doing this to Jon?

13:57.288 --> 14:00.386
Ask Jon, I never touched him.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.356
Jon,

14:39.293 --> 14:41.804
your dad and I want to say something to you

14:42.845 --> 14:45.087
and it's important, all right?

14:45.372 --> 14:46.611
Okay.

14:47.525 --> 14:49.345
We want you to know that

14:50.084 --> 14:53.415
we love you, very, very much.

14:55.074 --> 14:56.608
More than anything.

14:57.824 --> 15:00.578
And nothing is going
to change that, okay?

15:01.361 --> 15:02.900
- Okay.
- So...

15:04.759 --> 15:06.031
What I'm trying to say, Jon,

15:06.032 --> 15:10.913
is that no matter what happens,
no matter what you've done,

15:10.914 --> 15:14.058
even if it's really, really bad,

15:15.891 --> 15:18.758
we'll always love you,
you know that, don't you?

15:18.759 --> 15:19.825
Yeah.

15:21.578 --> 15:23.734
We'll always love you, Jon.

15:25.266 --> 15:27.211
But you've got to
tell the truth.

15:28.682 --> 15:29.853
Mum.

15:35.908 --> 15:38.260
Mum, I wanted to tell you.

15:43.926 --> 15:45.457
I did kill him.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.914
What about his mum?

16:14.256 --> 16:16.179
Will you tell her I'm sorry?

16:22.283 --> 16:24.353
Where did you find James?

16:25.979 --> 16:27.279
At the butcher's.

16:27.775 --> 16:29.806
And whose idea
was it to take him?

16:31.142 --> 16:34.251
Mine, then it was
Robert's idea to kill him.

16:36.075 --> 16:37.762
Why did you want to take him?

16:38.590 --> 16:42.513
I just said to Robert, is
that boy lost or something?

16:43.058 --> 16:45.323
We were looking around
for his mum for a bit,

16:46.409 --> 16:49.971
but then we got fed up and
we went outside to the canal.

16:51.812 --> 16:55.211
Come on, baby, come on, let's
look at the water, come on.

16:55.212 --> 16:56.645
Let's push him in.

16:59.668 --> 17:02.809
Then Robert picked him up
and threw him on the floor,

17:03.121 --> 17:05.542
and that's how he got
the bump on his head.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.464
- Was he crying then?
- Yeah.

17:16.214 --> 17:19.620
We ran away but
then we came back

17:20.331 --> 17:22.604
and he was already
walking up to us.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.759
I'm sick of having
my little brother,

17:43.760 --> 17:45.455
I have him from school
all the time.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.728
I'm gonna tell my mum I
ain't gonna mind him no more.

17:51.207 --> 17:52.274
Come on.

18:26.219 --> 18:28.305
We got to the middle of
the bridge

18:29.157 --> 18:31.204
and Robert opened the paint tin,

18:31.784 --> 18:32.995
and then

18:34.708 --> 18:37.026
he threw it in James' face.

18:39.020 --> 18:41.215
I can't tell you anything else.

18:42.105 --> 18:43.172
Why?

18:45.150 --> 18:47.189
'Cause that's the worst bit.

18:50.375 --> 18:53.016
Okay, right,

18:54.024 --> 18:55.880
I know that's the worst bit,

18:56.609 --> 18:58.952
but you know what you
did and if you try hard,

18:58.953 --> 19:00.418
you'll be able to tell us.

19:00.842 --> 19:03.155
Just have a little rest,
think about it

19:03.156 --> 19:05.062
and just tell us what happened.

19:06.935 --> 19:08.826
We took him on the railway

19:09.560 --> 19:11.764
and started throwing
bricks at him.

19:12.130 --> 19:13.263
Who did?

19:14.214 --> 19:15.347
Robbie.

19:17.386 --> 19:20.138
He just said, he said,
"Stand there

19:20.651 --> 19:23.042
"and we'll get you a
plaster or something."

19:23.706 --> 19:27.456
Then he lifted this brick
up and threw it in his face.

19:29.041 --> 19:30.930
You've denied a lot
of things, Robert,

19:30.931 --> 19:32.586
and then admitted them.

19:32.587 --> 19:34.390
We were right about
those things,

19:34.391 --> 19:36.311
and we're right about
this as well.

19:36.312 --> 19:38.570
Yeah, well, I didn't kill him.

19:39.180 --> 19:42.358
If you just tell them the truth, this
will all be over in a few minutes.

19:42.359 --> 19:44.293
Jon threw a brick in his face.

19:44.294 --> 19:45.560
Why?

19:45.782 --> 19:46.958
I don't know.

19:47.364 --> 19:49.848
Right, we're getting there,
aren't we?

19:50.770 --> 19:52.293
We're getting to the truth now.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.300
Yeah, well, I'm gonna end
up getting all the blame

19:55.301 --> 19:56.784
'cause I've got blood on me.

19:56.785 --> 19:59.097
What happened after
Jon threw the brick?

19:59.597 --> 20:01.151
The brick hit him in his face

20:01.152 --> 20:02.644
and he fell over on the floor.

20:02.877 --> 20:04.736
Why the hell didn't
you just leave?

20:04.737 --> 20:07.002
I did, after that I ran.

20:07.453 --> 20:09.104
I left Jon on his own.

20:09.589 --> 20:12.706
- What was the baby doing?
- He was just on the floor crying.

20:13.554 --> 20:15.292
Was he awake or asleep?

20:15.705 --> 20:17.095
What do you mean?

20:17.326 --> 20:19.165
Like was he asleep, or?

20:19.166 --> 20:20.665
He was awake.

20:22.135 --> 20:23.737
Then Robbie said,

20:24.582 --> 20:27.547
"Pick up a brick and throw it."

20:27.980 --> 20:29.269
But I just,

20:31.032 --> 20:32.915
I threw it on the floor.

20:34.345 --> 20:39.483
I missed it on purpose 'cause
I didn't wanna hurt him.

20:40.298 --> 20:44.016
But then Robbie picked up the
same brick and threw it again.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.608
I don't think that you've
told us the full truth.

20:48.609 --> 20:50.124
That's all I seen.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.874
We already know about
things that happened

20:51.875 --> 20:53.755
and it doesn't explain a lot of things.

20:53.756 --> 20:55.498
And you were there,
like, and seen me?

20:55.771 --> 20:59.138
No, but we can tell what
happened from his injuries.

20:59.763 --> 21:02.640
Why would I take flowers over
to the baby if I killed him?

21:03.255 --> 21:06.754
I know the truth, I
believe I know the truth.

21:06.755 --> 21:08.574
So do I, I was there.

21:08.575 --> 21:10.559
- That's right.
- You weren't.

21:13.144 --> 21:16.152
Then Robbie threw about 10
bricks.

21:16.965 --> 21:19.097
I only threw six or five,

21:20.207 --> 21:23.394
but I missed James and
hit him in the arm

21:24.902 --> 21:27.050
because I never meant
to hit him in the arm,

21:27.862 --> 21:30.426
I wanted to get the
brick to the side of him,

21:30.427 --> 21:31.760
Was he bleeding?

21:32.390 --> 21:33.623
All over.

21:36.408 --> 21:38.086
It's all our family,

21:38.087 --> 21:40.148
it's always our family
that gets the blame.

21:40.149 --> 21:42.234
Your family might've
got blamed in the past,

21:42.531 --> 21:44.382
but on this occasion,
we're right, aren't we?

21:44.383 --> 21:46.617
No, 'cause I never touched him.

21:47.047 --> 21:48.773
Tell us what happened then.

21:49.172 --> 21:50.741
Jon threw another brick.

21:50.742 --> 21:52.336
Where did that hit him?

21:52.337 --> 21:53.821
On there.

21:53.822 --> 21:54.993
What happened then?

21:54.994 --> 21:58.080
Then he hit him again with a big
metal thing that had holes in it.

21:58.283 --> 21:59.986
Where did he hit him with that?

22:00.353 --> 22:03.439
In the head, he just
went like that and hit him.

22:05.253 --> 22:07.042
He hit him with the bar

22:07.581 --> 22:09.557
and I think he was knocked out.

22:09.987 --> 22:13.244
Then we threw a few bricks
at him and we ran away.

22:13.846 --> 22:15.413
Why did you run away?

22:15.783 --> 22:17.310
I don't know,

22:17.704 --> 22:19.550
I just said to Robert,

22:20.267 --> 22:22.501
don't you think we've
done enough now?

22:23.753 --> 22:25.656
Were you angry with James?

22:26.113 --> 22:29.503
No, I didn't really
want to hurt him.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.158
I didn't want to
hurt him or nothing,

22:32.159 --> 22:36.079
'cause I didn't want to
hurt him with strong things,

22:36.080 --> 22:37.768
only, like, light things.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.042
So, you only wanted to
hurt him a little bit.

22:45.116 --> 22:46.866
Answer the question.

22:48.255 --> 22:50.427
Why did you want to
hurt him a little bit?

22:52.607 --> 22:56.185
I mean, I didn't want
to hurt him, really,

22:57.560 --> 22:59.161
Robert probably,

23:00.833 --> 23:03.527
Robbie was probably
doing it for fun or something,

23:03.528 --> 23:05.458
'cause he was laughing his head off.

23:06.372 --> 23:09.292
Why did, why did he do all this?

23:09.293 --> 23:10.808
Why did Jon do all this?

23:10.809 --> 23:13.043
I don't know, that's
what I don't know.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.518
I don't believe, Robert,
that you just stood idly by

23:15.519 --> 23:17.371
while Jon did all those things.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.361
I was trying to pull Jon back.

23:19.580 --> 23:21.955
Job has admitted to throwing
stones, things like that,

23:22.236 --> 23:24.415
but he's also blaming
you on a lot of things.

23:24.767 --> 23:26.813
I don't think Jon
did everything.

23:26.814 --> 23:28.754
Yeah, well, I never.

23:28.755 --> 23:29.980
I think you hit him.

23:29.981 --> 23:31.333
Well, that's what you think.

23:31.334 --> 23:34.067
There's only one person here
that knows the whole truth.

23:34.068 --> 23:36.794
I know, and I've
just said it all.

23:37.037 --> 23:40.458
I know I never hit him so I've
got nothing to bother about.

23:42.618 --> 23:44.001
I can't,

23:45.657 --> 23:47.798
I can't sit through any more of this.

23:50.558 --> 23:53.268
Did either of you
take James' clothes off?

23:54.793 --> 23:57.707
Robert pulled his
pants off and his undies

23:58.457 --> 24:00.418
and I pulled his shoes off.

24:03.350 --> 24:04.550
Why?

24:06.397 --> 24:10.061
I don't know why, it was
last week, I keep forgetting.

24:11.535 --> 24:13.198
I don't any more now, dad.

24:13.456 --> 24:15.666
He's asking me too
hard questions.

24:56.937 --> 24:58.210
Why would I want to kill a baby

24:58.211 --> 24:59.898
when I've got a baby of my own?

25:00.359 --> 25:04.069
If I wanted to kill a baby,
I'd kill my own, wouldn't I?

25:04.593 --> 25:07.585
Well, you said your own
baby is family, didn't you?

25:07.920 --> 25:09.123
What do you mean?

25:09.124 --> 25:10.716
Well, that's what you said.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.505
I know he's my family,
I'm not stupid.

25:12.506 --> 25:14.239
I don't even know what
you're going on about.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.357
When James' body was found,

25:16.841 --> 25:19.200
his bottom clothing had been removed.

25:20.168 --> 25:22.153
Can you tell us why that is?

25:22.154 --> 25:25.441
- No.
- Did you start playing with him?

25:26.033 --> 25:27.198
With who?

25:28.143 --> 25:29.752
With James' bottom.

25:29.958 --> 25:31.315
No.

25:31.316 --> 25:32.580
Are you sure now?

25:32.822 --> 25:35.071
Yeah, I'm not a pervert,
you know?

25:35.072 --> 25:38.064
Jon says it was you who pulled
off his pants and his underpants.

25:38.322 --> 25:40.594
So in other words,
you're taking what Jon says

25:40.595 --> 25:43.008
and just ignoring me,
so I'll ignore you.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.376
There was an injury to James' mouth.

25:46.895 --> 25:48.401
Do you know anything about that?

25:48.402 --> 25:50.895
No, I'm not answering any more.

25:52.071 --> 25:54.906
I think there's still some
things you haven't told us, Jon.

25:55.867 --> 25:58.953
The batteries, why were
the batteries there?

26:00.342 --> 26:01.402
I don't know.

26:01.403 --> 26:02.862
I think you do know, Jon.

26:02.863 --> 26:05.347
I never put them there,
Robert just threw them.

26:05.348 --> 26:07.284
It was a little bit
more than throwing them.

26:07.285 --> 26:10.090
I don't know, I don't know, dad.

26:10.426 --> 26:13.510
Jon, is it horrible what
happened to the batteries?

26:13.511 --> 26:16.393
I don't know anything about what
Robert did with the batteries.

26:16.394 --> 26:17.588
Why are you crying then?

26:17.589 --> 26:21.541
Because you'll blame it on me, that I had
them, I don't know about the batteries,

26:21.542 --> 26:23.431
I don't know, I don't know.

26:23.432 --> 26:25.602
Hey, hey, don't go
to punch your dad.

26:25.603 --> 26:27.618
My dad thinks I
know and I don't.

26:27.619 --> 26:30.830
You're saying I do and I don't,
I only know he got killed.

26:30.831 --> 26:32.331
Calm down, Jon.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.484
Can you tell us what
happened to James' mouth?

26:35.485 --> 26:37.820
I don't know, I
never saw nothing.

26:37.821 --> 26:39.523
Jon, you've got to
admit to yourself

26:39.524 --> 26:41.554
but you saw everything
that happened there

26:41.555 --> 26:43.289
because you were a part of it.

26:43.290 --> 26:44.397
No, I never.

26:44.398 --> 26:46.498
So you can't say you didn't see.

26:46.499 --> 26:49.139
No, I want my mum,
please, I never.

26:49.459 --> 26:51.739
Please, I don't know,
make it stop, dad,

26:51.740 --> 26:53.598
please, make it stop,
make it stop,

26:53.599 --> 26:56.412
make it stop, make it
stop, make it stop!

27:15.895 --> 27:17.739
We're gonna take a drive, Jon.

27:18.028 --> 27:21.685
We'll start at the Strand and you can
show us the route you took from there.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.804
Look, that's us.

28:30.198 --> 28:31.824
There's a lot of those around.

28:31.825 --> 28:34.325
You don't need them now, do you?

28:37.718 --> 28:39.895
How come my picture is
in black and white,

28:39.896 --> 28:41.616
and Robert's isn't?

28:45.093 --> 28:46.749
Don't know, Jon.

28:59.670 --> 29:01.771
Was that a train going past?

29:02.837 --> 29:06.017
- Yeah.
- I know all them trains.
