WEBVTT

00:05.106 --> 00:06.707
This won't be the first time
I've had to be glamorous

00:07.007 --> 00:08.242
under my husband.

00:08.776 --> 00:11.679
<i>I decided long ago
that I will say how I feel.</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:13.047
Well, if you're gonna put me on the stand,

00:13.080 --> 00:14.448
I better have my lawyer present.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.650
<i>The election
is in eight fucking months.</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:19.453
<i>Keep your mouth shut, we'll be fine.</i>

00:19.487 --> 00:22.156
Get another wife if you want a silent one.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.425
They used to like each other.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.094
<i>You're a good person deep down.</i>

00:28.662 --> 00:31.031
<i>Met a young couple
tonight reminded me of being</i>

00:31.065 --> 00:33.033
at the beginning of something.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.502
McCord, wasn't it?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.303
I appreciate you, James McCord.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.606
California?

00:38.639 --> 00:40.274
<i>We got a couple
of fundraisers out there.</i>

00:40.307 --> 00:43.177
- My mom says Nixon's dogshit.
- I've never even met the guy.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.746
We got a kind of
special opportunity for you.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.581
You mean you want to set up
an espionage unit

00:47.615 --> 00:50.217
<i>here, in- inside the Committee
to Re-elect.</i>

00:50.251 --> 00:51.051
I think I know a guy.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.654
- Liddy, general counsel.
- Soldier.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.689
<i>This operation requires</i>

00:55.723 --> 00:58.092
<i>untraceable foreign contractors.</i>

00:58.125 --> 00:59.393
I need five Cubans.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.562
How expensive are Cubans these days?

01:01.595 --> 01:05.299
<i>They're freedom
fighters, you fuck!</i>

01:09.503 --> 01:11.305
- <i>Mr. Dean?</i>
- <i>I'll see myself out.</i>

01:11.338 --> 01:13.674
There she is, <i>machos...</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:15.209
our destiny.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.343
<i>El Watergate.</i>

01:54.348 --> 01:56.116
Voilà, Mrs. Mitchell.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.519
What do you think?

02:00.187 --> 02:02.490
I don't-I don't see a difference.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.557
We love it.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.259
I knew you would.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.234
I'm noticing a few gaps

02:13.267 --> 02:15.236
in your employment history.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.305
One here in 1965,

02:18.339 --> 02:22.343
and here a whole year in 1969.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.178
You mind explaining what you were doing

02:24.211 --> 02:26.180
during those periods?

02:26.213 --> 02:29.683
I guess you could say
there was times I was doing it

02:29.717 --> 02:34.722
and, um, you know,
times I was getting it done.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.323
You know what I mean, brother?

02:38.559 --> 02:40.694
I'm afraid I do not.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.429
Mm-hmm.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.934
Um, just odd jobs, mostly.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.403
Mr. Wills--

02:49.436 --> 02:52.573
Frank, you can just--
you just call me Frank.

02:52.606 --> 02:56.210
Mr. Wills, I really appreciate, um,

02:56.243 --> 02:57.811
you coming all the way down here,

02:57.845 --> 03:01.916
but I'm afraid you're not
what we're looking for.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.918
What- what is it?
My-my mustache?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.719
'Cause I can shave it off, no problem.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.254
To be honest,

03:07.288 --> 03:09.690
you're not really a right fit
for the front desk.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.725
Come on, man, please.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.360
Look, I'll level with you.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.830
I've been to, like, ten
of these interviews this week.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.266
I got my bills up to here.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.869
If this ain't working for me,

03:21.902 --> 03:24.238
I'm out of this town, dig?

03:24.271 --> 03:27.241
Now, you just tell me, what do I gotta do?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.348
Name the capitals.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.685
Sorry?

03:37.718 --> 03:40.721
If you're on the front desk,
you only have one job,

03:40.754 --> 03:45.392
and that job is to make
white folks feel secure,

03:45.426 --> 03:49.396
<i>and nothing makes white folks
feel more secure</i>

03:49.430 --> 03:53.300
than a friendly public-school-educated boy

03:53.334 --> 03:55.502
<i>that knows the capitals.</i>

03:56.570 --> 03:59.873
Now, if you feel that's unfair,

03:59.907 --> 04:01.508
I hear that the Howard Johnson's

04:01.542 --> 04:03.277
across the street is hiring.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.847
What you want?

04:09.950 --> 04:12.319
Yeah, I got the job.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.455
The night job at the Watergate.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.457
Yeah, guy hired me on a provisional basis,

04:16.490 --> 04:18.993
but that's only 'cause I forgot Bismarck.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.561
It's the capital of North Dakota.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.862
Look, never mind. The bus is coming.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.664
I will tell you about it later.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.767
All right, I gotta go.
All right, all right, bye.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.436
Oh, I-I'm so sorry, man.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.608
We're all flaked with sorrow
from birth, son.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.810
It's up to each of us to pull it off.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.880
No apology necessary.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.312
Shh.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.989
Eagle.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.557
Falcon.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.113
The whole point
of breaking into the DNC

05:46.346 --> 05:49.550
was to capture intimate
campaign conversations.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.721
And you idiots, you bug
the secretarial lines?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.993
Hey, Gordo. What's up, compadre?

06:00.027 --> 06:02.029
All these transcripts, Howard.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.030
Uh-huh.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.965
We've got nothing

06:04.998 --> 06:07.668
but a secretary
dirty-birding her boyfriend.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.106
"I am in my posy-pink panties.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.675
"They're so cute

06:14.708 --> 06:16.944
stretched across my little red bottom."

06:16.977 --> 06:20.614
Jesus, I wish I could get
my wife to talk like that.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.150
You have any idea

06:23.383 --> 06:24.985
how this reflects on the two of us, Hunt?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.054
This operation? To Mitchell and everybody?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.722
Yeah.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.625
Now, I want to know

06:31.658 --> 06:35.462
which one of you slack-jawed
equines placed these taps.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.665
Hmm? Who was it?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.806
- Look--
- Oh, we have a winner.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.074
I can't stop a secretary

06:47.107 --> 06:49.009
from using the phone for personal calls.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.044
You bug the source, not the ancillary.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.579
Are you familiar with black bag ops?

06:52.613 --> 06:54.047
- You've done black bag ops.
- You ever done that?

06:54.081 --> 06:56.817
Honestly, maybe it'd be better
to find another target.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.120
Hold on. I'm sorry.

07:00.154 --> 07:03.490
Are you the target finder now?

07:03.524 --> 07:07.561
Are-are you the main guy
who helps us find the targets?

07:07.594 --> 07:10.831
Nixon's beating the hell
out of McGovern in every poll.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.167
Is the DNC really his biggest threat?

07:13.200 --> 07:17.104
It is not your job
to determine the threat level,

07:17.137 --> 07:18.205
you dumb donkey.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.573
It's your job to sit by the phone

07:19.606 --> 07:21.975
and wait for a fucking order.

07:22.009 --> 07:25.612
Now, do you think you can do your job?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.649
Insofar as any of this is my job?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.151
Yes, sir. I can do my job.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.186
Brilliant.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.624
Okay.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.760
We gotta go in again.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.894
It's our only option.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.095
Yeah, somebody's gonna have

07:42.129 --> 07:44.131
to ask Mitchell for more money.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.699
I can do it.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.669
You're going to get more
out of Mitchell if you send me

07:48.702 --> 07:49.903
rather than one of the wetbacks.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.538
- No offense.
- <i>Oye, coño.</i>

07:51.572 --> 07:52.539
Who you calling a wetback, brother?

07:52.573 --> 07:53.807
We're Cuban, not Mexican.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.209
<i>Okay, okay, take it easy.</i>

07:55.242 --> 07:57.611
I'll do it.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.179
But I'm gonna need a lift.

07:59.213 --> 08:02.049
Sarah's got the station wagon today.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.688
Of course.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.093
- <i>After you.</i>
- You guys are so sensitive.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.198
[Martinez, in Spanish] <i>I don't get it.</i>

08:18.232 --> 08:20.934
They look like amateurs, so weird.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.669
Look,

08:22.703 --> 08:25.572
if Nixon doesn't get elected,

08:25.606 --> 08:27.608
we'll never get Fidel out of Cuba.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.844
It's true. Let's remember why
we are doing this--

08:30.878 --> 08:36.216
For Cuba.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.622
This guy doesn't stop eating.

08:43.790 --> 08:47.227
<i>You're listening to WRBT...</i>

08:47.261 --> 08:48.929
<i>No, oh, no, honey, honey.</i>

08:48.962 --> 08:50.731
If you're gonna bring more
than three pairs of shoes,

08:50.764 --> 08:51.832
you gotta do it in secret,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.233
or else people lose faith in you.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.203
You don't do anything in secret.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.874
- Mr. McCord.
- Hello.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.609
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.780
What can I do for you?

09:06.813 --> 09:08.548
Uh, I'm just here to drop off

09:08.582 --> 09:10.550
some papers for your husband.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.652
Oh, sure.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.720
Um, Marty, Katarina, would you--

09:13.754 --> 09:14.855
could you find Mr. Mitchell, please?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.156
He's around here somewhere.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.724
Sorry to bother you at home.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.126
I tried his office first.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.829
I was sorry to hear

09:22.863 --> 09:25.599
that you were taken off my detail.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.733
Apologies.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.968
I wanted to tell you myself,

09:28.001 --> 09:29.670
but it all happened so quickly.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.905
They put me on some security work.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.908
Clerical stuff mostly.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.679
Oh, this is a fine collection.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.247
You like it?

09:40.280 --> 09:43.784
Mm, I don't know if you
can say you like Rilke.

09:44.685 --> 09:49.289
There's so much desire
in there and... isolation.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.658
I don't know.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.360
I had to turn 40 before I got any of it.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.629
Oh, well, I'll give it a try
in a few years, then.

09:59.032 --> 10:03.170
Um, Mr. McCord, uh, my-my family and I,

10:03.203 --> 10:05.939
we are traveling out
to California for a fundraiser.

10:05.973 --> 10:09.009
I was wondering if you would
like to accompany us there.

10:10.077 --> 10:14.014
Oh, I would love to, Mrs. Mitchell, but...

10:14.047 --> 10:16.316
the campaign does have me very busy,

10:16.350 --> 10:19.820
and, um, I am needed at home.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.021
Of course, understood.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.224
I just--um, I don't often find a bodyguard

10:24.257 --> 10:26.793
that I can have a conversation
with, that's all.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.096
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.199
Oh, no, no, no, no. Of course not.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.034
McCord?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.102
Yes, sir.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.970
Uh, I have a few matters of paperwork

10:37.004 --> 10:39.306
pertaining to our earlier conversation.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.875
In the study.

10:46.380 --> 10:47.848
It's very nice to see you again.

10:47.881 --> 10:48.882
Oh.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.197
<i>What are you doing with my book?</i>

11:05.999 --> 11:08.201
Helping you not forget it.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.985
Is he, um--

11:25.018 --> 11:26.720
you think he'll be out soon?

11:26.753 --> 11:28.055
I-I don't mean to be rude.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.290
It's just, I ha-I have a plane
to catch this afternoon

11:30.323 --> 11:32.059
for a conference in the Philippines.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.460
The president should be wrapping up

11:33.693 --> 11:36.196
with Senator Thurmond in just a moment.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.364
Hard candy?

11:40.734 --> 11:42.936
Couple of Chatty Cathys.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.872
It shouldn't be
too much longer. Mr. Keane.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.011
- Dean.
- I'm sorry?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.947
My last name. You just called me Keane.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.248
- Keane?
- Dean.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.050
- With a K?
- With a D.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.786
Dean.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.987
I don't remember a Dean

12:01.021 --> 12:03.190
in the Department of Transportation.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.292
Excuse me?

12:05.325 --> 12:06.793
<i>You're an assistant secretary</i>

12:06.827 --> 12:09.296
in the Department of Transportation?

12:10.464 --> 12:12.299
N-no. What?

12:12.332 --> 12:13.733
I'm junior counsel.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.402
Oh, gosh.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.805
What is my brain doing up there?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.011
Yes, Mr. President?

12:25.979 --> 12:30.350
<i>Um, Mr. Dean has been here
for the past 45 minutes.</i>

12:32.085 --> 12:34.321
Uh-huh. Certainly, I'll let him know.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.755
Thank you, Mr. President.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.092
<i>The president apologizes,</i>

12:39.126 --> 12:41.027
<i>but his meeting with Senator Thurmond</i>

12:41.061 --> 12:44.064
<i>has been extended indefinitely.</i>

12:44.097 --> 12:46.399
Fortunately, it looks
like we can reschedule

12:46.433 --> 12:48.835
your get-to-know-you for September.

12:49.936 --> 12:50.904
September?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.341
It's June.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.809
That's the next space

12:55.842 --> 12:57.310
the president has available,

12:57.344 --> 12:59.012
unless that's a problem.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.354
I serve at the pleasure of the president.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.422
That's the spirit.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.029
President Fucking Dick.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.331
Fucking piece of fucking asshole.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.433
Fucking, fucking shit. Fuck.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.972
Ow, Jesus.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.008
<i>Sir, I have
Maureen Kane returning.</i>

13:29.576 --> 13:31.378
Miss Kane.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.080
Hi. Well, I--God, that's all

13:34.114 --> 13:35.982
a girl's gotta do to reach
White House counsel?

13:36.016 --> 13:39.419
I think I imagined switchboards
all the way up Mount Olympus.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.321
Stop, I'm not that important.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.823
<i>Oh, Mr. False Modesty.</i>

13:43.857 --> 13:45.058
So come on, you have to tell me.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.459
How'd it go, anyway?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.094
<i>How- how'd what go?</i>

13:48.128 --> 13:51.331
Your meeting with the president
of the United States?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.500
Oh, that, I--yeah, I, um--

13:53.533 --> 13:56.903
<i>No, I-I-I had to reschedule
that, actually.</i>

13:56.937 --> 13:58.471
You had to reschedule?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.574
Yeah, you know, I-I've been so busy lately

14:00.607 --> 14:02.309
with, uh, you know, meetings and stuff.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.577
You don't think that's rude, do you,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.011
to reschedule a meeting
with the president?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.947
Maybe it looks like I'm too busy for him.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.849
Uh, no, I-I don't--
I think it's a good thing,

14:09.883 --> 14:12.385
shows you're not sitting around
like the village idiot

14:12.419 --> 14:13.920
<i>waiting for him to meet with you.</i>

14:13.954 --> 14:16.122
<i>You've, you know,
got other things going on.</i>

14:16.156 --> 14:17.991
<i>- Important things.</i>
- Right.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.559
Blonde, important,

14:19.593 --> 14:21.861
"best thing that ever happened
to you" things.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.630
Well, that reminds me,
I-I got some bad news.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.899
I-I don't think I can make it
to see you this weekend.

14:27.901 --> 14:28.969
What? No.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.537
I've got the tickets to Cat Stevens

14:30.570 --> 14:32.038
at the Bowl Saturday night.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.873
<i>I know, and I love Cat Stevens,</i>

14:33.907 --> 14:35.575
but I have this conference in Manila.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.510
It totally slipped my mind. I'm sorry.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.381
I have Senator Gurney on the line,

14:41.414 --> 14:43.116
and he says it's urgent.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.317
Right.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.120
Look, I-I gotta take
this other call, but, um,

14:47.153 --> 14:48.221
on my way back through the States,

14:48.255 --> 14:49.422
how about I stop by LA?

14:49.456 --> 14:52.492
<i>Who's playing at the Bowl Tuesday?</i>

14:52.525 --> 14:55.495
- The Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
- Perfect.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.663
I love--it's beautiful. I--

14:56.896 --> 14:58.164
We'll make a night of it, okay?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.299
<i>I'll talk to you soon.</i>

15:01.167 --> 15:03.103
Okay, I'll light a candle in my window.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.404
Bye, now.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.522
Anything else, Mrs. Mitchell?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.291
I'm fine. Thank you, dear.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.159
Oh, and about your daughter.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.128
She asked for a Bloody Mary.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.663
Okay.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.031
She's 11 years old, ma'am.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.932
Mm-hmm. Oh, I see.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.200
Don't make it too spicy.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.972
Three campaign events in one day,

15:39.005 --> 15:41.541
we'll die of dumbfuck exposure.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.614
<i>You reading poetry now?</i>

15:50.717 --> 15:52.986
I'm in a bit
of a wistful mood, I guess,

15:53.019 --> 15:56.256
thinking about a... a boy I once knew.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.161
Is this gonna be the
center fielder from college?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.531
<i>The oil baron from Midland?</i>

16:05.699 --> 16:07.967
Walter. Arkansas boy.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.136
Took me to my first dance when we were 12.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.137
<i>Mm.</i>

16:12.305 --> 16:14.240
And once in a while,

16:14.274 --> 16:16.443
you still wonder
what it might have been like

16:16.476 --> 16:19.312
if you had married
simple Walter from Pine Bluff.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.154
We used to be a team.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.192
Now it's just...

16:35.628 --> 16:37.364
...jokes and silences

16:37.397 --> 16:41.501
and the occasional rough sex
and campaign business.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.236
Doesn't sound so bad.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.504
I'm serious.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.473
I thought you'd be happy
going to California.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.575
You can talk to Zsa Zsa and Clint.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.643
Push Lana Turner in the pool.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.145
I'm not a show pony.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.780
You can't just trot me around
and then put me back

16:54.013 --> 16:55.782
in the stable at the end of the night.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.017
<i>I don't know
what you want me to say.</i>

16:58.051 --> 16:59.552
These things happen in a marriage,

16:59.586 --> 17:02.021
and you didn't marry
simple Walter from Pine Bluff.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.423
You married me.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.408
I like your traveling suit.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.583
Ten Americans killed,

17:30.617 --> 17:33.253
eight missing, 75 wounded.

17:33.286 --> 17:37.357
<i>South Vietnam reported 1,149 killed,</i>

17:37.390 --> 17:40.827
<i>the heaviest weekly toll
for them for the entire war.</i>

17:41.060 --> 17:44.597
Gotta get the crease right.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.300
<i>President Nixon
said last night...</i>

17:47.333 --> 17:49.736
See that?

17:49.769 --> 17:52.572
It's all in the details, Tuffy.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.574
Look at you licking the plate.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.183
I will be back at the crack of dawn,

18:03.216 --> 18:05.084
and I'm bringing doughnuts.

18:08.521 --> 18:12.158
I'm all right. Thank you, thank you.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.359
Ma'am.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.195
How you doing this evening?

18:17.464 --> 18:18.865
All right.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.136
Oh, man, don't mind Mrs. Emerson.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.571
She's, um--

18:24.604 --> 18:25.805
she's a little skittish.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.373
<i>Name's Alberto.</i>

18:27.407 --> 18:29.709
- Frank Wills.
- Nice to meet you.

18:29.742 --> 18:30.877
Yeah.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.645
You ever work security before,
Frank Wills?

18:32.679 --> 18:35.248
Well, I, um--I was up
in Michigan at Job Corps...

18:35.281 --> 18:36.349
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and before that,

18:36.382 --> 18:38.117
I was working part-time

18:38.151 --> 18:40.119
at a department store back in Georgia.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.756
Well, things around here
are pretty simple.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.592
Uh, there's the logbook,

18:45.625 --> 18:48.561
schedule, uh, walkie,

18:48.595 --> 18:50.263
flashlight for your rounds.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.699
Anyone comes down for a package,

18:52.732 --> 18:54.501
we keep them under the desk.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.138
Shit, man, uh, weekend's a dead zone.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.874
Oh, there's a bum who comes around

19:00.907 --> 19:04.477
and pisses in the planters,
but that's about it.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.845
I got you.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.481
Have a good night.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.217
And hey, don't fall asleep on the job.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.852
Got it.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.487
At least don't get caught.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.534
Eagle Eye, this is Sparrow.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.668
Come in, Eagle Eye.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.171
<i>Go for Eagle Eye. Over.</i>

19:32.205 --> 19:34.240
The guards have just
changed shifts for the night.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.742
Over.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.477
<i>How are we doing otherwise? Over.</i>

19:41.414 --> 19:43.650
<i>We still have
a few guys in the office.</i>

19:43.683 --> 19:46.853
<i>Looks like they're packing up
to get out of there. Over.</i>

19:46.886 --> 19:48.388
<i>Copy that.</i>

19:48.421 --> 19:51.691
We've got a visual on
the side street from our room.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.593
Carrion Falcon, you in position? Over.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.399
<i>Carrion Falcon,
are you in position? Over.</i>

19:59.432 --> 20:00.833
Roger that, Eagle Eye.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.203
In position and waiting
on your signal. Over.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.905
Over and out, I mean.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.394
<i>♪ Things to do ♪</i>

20:28.428 --> 20:33.266
<i>♪ Can't let my shoes Pick dust up ♪</i>

20:33.299 --> 20:35.268
<i>♪ Won't slow down ♪</i>

20:35.301 --> 20:39.539
<i>♪ I can't afford To let up... ♪</i>

20:39.572 --> 20:42.008
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.644
Can I get another gin and tonic, please?

20:44.677 --> 20:45.878
Ah, yes.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.614
And the president
is very pleased

20:47.647 --> 20:49.315
with this conservative movement

20:49.349 --> 20:50.883
you got going out here with Reagan.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.987
John, we're not building it
for the president's pleasure.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.723
We consider this
our own movement out here,

20:56.756 --> 20:58.491
a-a new conservative politics

20:58.524 --> 21:01.561
centered around the Christian family,

21:01.594 --> 21:04.030
not making nice with Red China.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.934
All I'm saying
is that Ronnie's endorsement

21:07.967 --> 21:09.902
would mean the world to Dick.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.638
The only thing that means dick to Dick

21:11.671 --> 21:13.039
is more glory for Dick.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.441
Both of you, stop it.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.410
Don't tell me y'all
are still talking shop.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.845
Your husband here set a trap for me.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.913
I've been struggling to get out of it.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.949
I've been trying to wriggle my way

21:22.982 --> 21:24.651
out of his snare for 15 years.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.722
- Michael.
- Oh.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.591
Would you like to join me
in a game of pool?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.359
Maybe it'll make him jealous.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.661
I'd love nothing more.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.370
<i>Oh, God.</i>

21:44.404 --> 21:45.905
I forgot the first rule of billiards.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.040
Never put money on a game

21:47.073 --> 21:48.508
when there's a Southern woman involved.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.476
Mm.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.844
Now, tell me something.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.048
When Reagan went
for the nomination in '68,

21:55.081 --> 21:57.083
did he make a stop in Pine Bluff?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.585
Uh, I can't say that we did.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.387
Mm, it's probably for the best.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.656
They're just wild for Nixon down there.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.525
They love him even more than they love me.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.696
All right.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.998
One Mitchell gets me toast,
and the other one butters me up

22:12.031 --> 22:13.800
for the Reagan endorsement.
Is that how this works?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.935
<i>Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.</i>

22:15.968 --> 22:18.071
You're more than just
some jacket potato to us.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.605
You're a dear friend, Michael.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.374
Scotch, please.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.809
<i>Nixon's on the road
to reelection.</i>

22:22.842 --> 22:24.077
We all know that.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.479
But his reputation's taken a huge hit.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.382
<i>People know what he did to Musky,</i>

22:29.415 --> 22:32.051
what he and Kissinger did
to tank the peace talks in '68.

22:32.085 --> 22:33.886
That didn't play too well in California.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.389
Yeah, that was a tough call in '68.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.592
Not as tough as the one Ronnie had to make

22:39.625 --> 22:41.861
to book his flight home
after he lost the nomination.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.396
Beloved.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.798
In four years, Ronnie wants to run

22:45.832 --> 22:47.934
a presidential campaign that's based on--

22:47.967 --> 22:51.738
Yeah, on fair representation
and-and moral integrity

22:51.771 --> 22:54.440
and all bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

22:55.608 --> 22:56.843
You know, with that attitude,
it's a wonder

22:56.876 --> 22:59.846
you haven't racked up our endorsement yet.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.848
Well, with that kind of blind confidence,

23:01.881 --> 23:03.015
it's a wonder you haven't been able

23:03.049 --> 23:04.617
to break through in the South.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.453
<i>You know, if I were Reagan, I would wonder</i>

23:07.487 --> 23:10.923
why someone as charming
and noble as myself

23:10.957 --> 23:12.658
could get crushed in the South

23:12.692 --> 23:14.994
by a supposed liar and cheat like Nixon.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.463
<i>It's no mystery,</i>

23:17.497 --> 23:19.165
at least not to the people of Pine Bluff.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.635
<i>They put their faith in Nixon,
and in return,</i>

23:22.668 --> 23:25.505
he won the presidency for them,
and now everything he does

23:25.538 --> 23:27.740
looks like a confirmation of their faith.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.543
<i>So what if he had to get down
in the mud to do it?</i>

23:30.576 --> 23:33.079
Even Christ had to wash a few dirty feet.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.183
Are you actually comparing Dick Nixon

23:37.416 --> 23:38.751
to Jesus Christ right now?

23:38.785 --> 23:40.186
No.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.922
Jesus Christ wouldn't make it
through the Republican primary.

23:52.865 --> 23:53.900
<i>...their Constitution</i>

23:53.933 --> 23:55.802
<i>and their love of apple pie.</i>

23:55.835 --> 23:57.904
<i>It is difficult to alert this country</i>

23:57.937 --> 23:59.572
<i>and throughout the media</i>

23:59.605 --> 24:02.008
<i>that the conspiracy
is not something small.</i>

24:02.041 --> 24:04.443
<i>It is huge, and it is beyond the realm</i>

24:04.477 --> 24:06.579
<i>of most people's imagination.</i>

24:06.612 --> 24:08.781
<i>The conspiracy is for the world domination</i>

24:08.815 --> 24:10.650
<i>of the United States.</i>

24:12.885 --> 24:14.654
Down by two in the fourth quarter,

24:14.687 --> 24:16.656
the young star from North Augusta

24:16.689 --> 24:19.525
lines up for a 48-yarder.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.928
I gotta tell you,
this is a risky one for Wills.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.164
A lot riding on this.
Can he pull this off?

24:26.732 --> 24:27.733
Ooh.

24:28.734 --> 24:29.802
Sorry, sir.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.572
Oh, man.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.178
Oh, shoot.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.069
Eagle Eye, the final gophers
have left the hole.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.538
Repeat, we are a go on the hole.

26:03.629 --> 26:04.864
<i>Ah, coño.</i>

26:52.979 --> 26:53.946
Shit.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.182
- What?
- Quiet.

26:56.215 --> 26:59.118
The transceivers, they're back at HQ.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.619
Liddy wanted fresh batteries.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.355
I told him the batteries
were already fresh.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.323
- Fuck me!
- Quiet!

27:08.160 --> 27:12.098
Eagle Eye, this is Carrion Falcon.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.733
We are earless.

27:13.766 --> 27:17.970
Repeat, we are without ears. Over.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.872
Cleared to retrieve. Over.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.941
But make it quick. Over.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.409
Oh, shit, get out of here.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.711
Shit, shit, shit, shit,

27:25.745 --> 27:28.714
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.883
Shit, shit,

27:30.916 --> 27:33.652
shit, shit, shit, shit.

27:33.686 --> 27:36.255
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

27:36.288 --> 27:39.158
Watch it, asshole!

27:39.191 --> 27:40.826
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.889
Hey, man.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.892
Hey, you can't be putting tape
on the door like this.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.894
It's against code or something.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.763
Pardon me, sir?
Hawkins Deli is already closed.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.698
Do you know if there's another place open?

28:19.732 --> 28:21.767
Sorry, man,
it's my first night on the job.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.771
- All right, thanks anyway.
- Mm-hmm.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.076
Hey, wait up.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.277
Um...

28:33.045 --> 28:34.814
...I just remembered
there's a burger joint

28:34.847 --> 28:35.981
down the street from here.

28:36.015 --> 28:36.982
Come on, I'll take you to it.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.954
Like the wind, man, go!

28:47.159 --> 28:50.863
You can always put on
another jacket, but, like,

28:50.896 --> 28:53.432
if it's hot, you can only
take off so many layers, so...

28:53.466 --> 28:55.468
Yeah, well, I mean, but see,
in Atlanta, you can...

28:55.501 --> 28:58.404
Shit, shit, shit.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.398
Clay Pigeon, this is Carrion Falcon.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.034
Something's wrong with the door down here.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.904
Requesting immediate assistance. Over.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.774
Help me. Over.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.209
What the fuck?

29:38.777 --> 29:39.912
Something's wrong with the fucking door.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.347
Get Road Runner down there immediately.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.915
Copy.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.250
Road Runner is on his way.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.919
I repeat, Road Runner's on his way. Over.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.491
All right,
let me do a patty melt,

29:52.525 --> 29:54.860
add Swiss cheese, and let me
get some extra mushrooms.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.829
Sorry, buddy, ran out of mushrooms.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.064
Y'all ran outta mushrooms?

29:59.098 --> 30:00.432
Look, pal, it's a mushroom town.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.034
What can I tell you?

30:06.906 --> 30:09.108
<i>Venga, cabrón. Vamos.</i>

30:23.389 --> 30:24.557
Oh, whoa.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.426
Venga.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.428
My strength is leaving me.

30:29.461 --> 30:30.529
<i>Rápido, rápido.</i>

30:32.565 --> 30:33.866
Copy.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.411
What the hell?

30:45.444 --> 30:47.479
The lock's all worn to shit.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.215
Gonzalez figured this'd be easier.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.618
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.588
<i>Venga. Rápido, rápido.</i>

30:55.621 --> 30:56.989
<i>Vamos.</i>

30:57.957 --> 31:00.426
- Take it easy.
- Put it back on.

31:19.912 --> 31:20.946
Yeah, well, you have a good night.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.414
- Yeah, you too, man.
- Yes, sir.

32:09.628 --> 32:13.232
"Even between the closest human beings,

32:13.265 --> 32:16.468
"infinite distances continue.

32:16.502 --> 32:20.272
"A wonderful living side by side can grow

32:20.306 --> 32:24.977
if they succeed in loving
the distance between them."

32:28.213 --> 32:30.015
It's Rilke.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.950
Yes, we had books in Queens too.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.954
John Newton Mitchell, I didn't know

32:35.988 --> 32:38.223
you were a such romantic.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.225
How do you know I'm not
just trying to get inside

32:40.259 --> 32:44.096
those Pine Bluff panties,
my little jacket potato?

32:46.198 --> 32:47.700
What's your angle here?

32:50.369 --> 32:52.271
I was thinking about
what we were talking about

32:52.304 --> 32:53.405
on the plane.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.508
About holding on to a good thing.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.745
And this is a good thing.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.517
I like what they're doing
out here for Reagan.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.722
And I was thinking that...

33:09.755 --> 33:12.191
after the campaign,

33:12.224 --> 33:15.327
maybe there'd be a place for us
out here in California.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.230
You want to move across the country

33:18.263 --> 33:19.465
and work for Reagan?

33:23.068 --> 33:25.070
The two of us are unstoppable.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.574
But I was never the one
driving that train.

33:31.076 --> 33:32.311
It was always you.

33:34.480 --> 33:38.217
Lord, look who sounds drunk now.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.219
Come here, let me sober you up.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.560
- Poetry.
- Mm.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.273
<i>Sparrow, come in.</i>

34:01.306 --> 34:03.275
<i>Looks like someone
just pulled up out front.</i>

34:03.308 --> 34:05.677
<i>Can you make them out
from your vantage? Over.</i>

34:13.719 --> 34:16.722
Just some hippies, sir.
Nothing to worry about. Over.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.119
<i>What's your status,
Carrion Falcon? Over.</i>

34:49.188 --> 34:51.256
Wrapping up in here. Over.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.695
Hey, guys, building's closed.
You can't come in here.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.263
You're the one who
called the cops, aren't you?

34:58.297 --> 34:59.364
Yeah, I mean--

34:59.398 --> 35:01.500
Relax, Mr. Tibbs.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.368
We were on vice detail
when we got the call.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.838
Maybe tell us what the hell's going on

35:05.871 --> 35:07.473
so we can get back to it.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.274
Okay, uh, I found a piece of tape

35:09.308 --> 35:12.144
on the parking garage door.

35:12.177 --> 35:13.846
- Tape?
- Over the door latch,

35:13.879 --> 35:15.581
like somebody was keeping it open.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.149
I thought it was a mistake the first time,

35:17.182 --> 35:18.350
and then it happened again,

35:18.383 --> 35:20.652
and I found another piece
on the sixth floor.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.455
- Hmm.
- Okay, uh, not to worry.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.290
We'll take it from here.

35:29.194 --> 35:31.129
Oh, um, you guys gonna head up there now?

35:31.163 --> 35:33.699
I can come with you, you know,
be your backup if you need.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.234
Uh, that's all right. We're good.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.336
Uh, you stay down here and, uh--

35:37.369 --> 35:38.470
Watch our perimeter.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.807
That's right, watch our six, Officer.

36:13.438 --> 36:14.773
Walkies off.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.321
Hide, hide. <i>Andale, andale.</i>

36:56.949 --> 36:58.550
Eagle Eye, were any of our guys

36:58.584 --> 37:00.686
by chance wearing a sport coat? Over.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.356
Our men are in suits.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.593
Did you mean suit jacket, Sparrow? Over.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.394
Maybe it's a windbreaker.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.599
What is a windbreaker again? Over.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.935
A windbreaker is the lighter version

37:16.969 --> 37:19.237
of what we typically refer to
as a jacket. Over.

37:19.271 --> 37:21.540
<i>I thought
that was a parka. Over.</i>

37:21.573 --> 37:23.475
No, no, no, a parka is a--

37:23.508 --> 37:24.910
it's-it's a whole different thing.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.879
It's much longer,
like a-a trench coat or a...

37:27.913 --> 37:28.981
- Yeah, it's a duster.
- Duster.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.716
<i>Think, uh, Gary Cooper in</i> Shane.

37:30.749 --> 37:31.883
<i>Over.</i>

37:31.917 --> 37:32.985
Duster.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.718
Mother of shit.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.720
Eagle Eye, the hippies are armed.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.689
The fucking hippies are armed.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.824
Wait, wait, wait. What's that, Sparrow?

38:12.858 --> 38:14.493
Armed pursuants on the sixth floor.

38:14.526 --> 38:15.794
They're headed for the gopher hole.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.596
Mayday! Mayday!

38:17.629 --> 38:18.930
Ah, ah!

38:18.964 --> 38:20.866
Carrion Falcon, did you hear that?

38:20.899 --> 38:22.634
<i>You got company on your six.
Abort mission.</i>

38:22.668 --> 38:25.470
I repeat, abort mission.
Please acknowledge. Over.

38:25.504 --> 38:26.672
Fuck, their walkies must be off.

38:26.705 --> 38:27.939
What's happening over there?

38:27.973 --> 38:29.608
How the fuck did you miss those guys?

38:29.641 --> 38:31.443
It was a goddamn hippie in a sport coat.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.311
- What was I supposed to do?
- You said windbreaker.

38:33.345 --> 38:34.646
Hippies don't wear windbreakers.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.580
Doesn't fucking matter!

38:35.614 --> 38:37.082
I'm gonna pack up my shit.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.583
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- Get the fucking shit out now.

38:38.617 --> 38:39.818
Grab the equipment.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.586
Swear to God, how do you
fucking miss that shit?

38:57.402 --> 38:59.471
- Fucking God damn it.
- Damn it.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.707
Help him. Help him. Get--

39:01.740 --> 39:03.108
Don't leave any fucking papers.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.812
I got no fucking fingernails. God.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.615
<i>Jump in.</i>

39:59.798 --> 40:02.834
All right,
we know you're in here.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.606
You, get up. Stand up.

40:07.639 --> 40:11.576
Let me see your hands.
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.844
Don't shoot.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.583
Don't shoot.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.891
Are you guys cops?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.859
What the fuck does it look like?

40:29.494 --> 40:31.563
May I see your badge?

40:46.511 --> 40:48.180
You're horrible.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.018
Oh, God, I'm trying to get to the bench.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.686
Oh, ooh!

40:56.822 --> 40:58.890
- Sir.
- Oh, heavens.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.892
Sorry to bother you.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.929
There's a phone call for you.
It's-it's Mr. Dean.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.697
- He says it's urgent.
- Patch him through.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.938
I don't like the new bodyguard.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.906
Well, you never
like the new bodyguard.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.678
I had a good time tonight.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.580
Me too.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.585
All right, take your call.
I'll go check on Marty.

41:58.250 --> 42:00.118
Somebody's playing possum.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.525
You seem happy.

42:07.559 --> 42:08.994
I am happy.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.234
Daddy bought it for me
at the airport.

42:16.268 --> 42:18.303
People say it's scary.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.139
- It's pretty boring so far.
- Hmm.

42:21.172 --> 42:23.675
Well, let me know how it turns out.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.711
She snores.

42:50.235 --> 42:51.269
Mitchell.

42:51.303 --> 42:53.204
Hello, sir.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.807
I'm-I'm sorry to disturb you on vacation.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.310
How is it down there? Or up there?

42:58.343 --> 43:00.845
Where is California
in relation to the Philippines

43:00.879 --> 43:02.981
latitude-wise? I don't know.

43:03.014 --> 43:06.584
It's just, I've had some
disturbing news from Jeb, sir.

43:06.618 --> 43:08.320
For Christ, fuck.

43:08.353 --> 43:12.090
It seems there was
a mix-up at the Watergate.

43:12.123 --> 43:16.594
A security guard, uh, bust
the whole operation, Jeb says.

43:16.628 --> 43:17.929
Bust it wide open.

43:17.963 --> 43:22.334
Apparently, a-a-a door
was-was taped incorrectly.

43:22.367 --> 43:23.935
What the fuck are you talking about?

43:23.969 --> 43:26.638
It was-it was difficult to
make out the details exactly.

43:26.671 --> 43:29.708
Jeb was crying when he told me.
He was actually crying, sir.

43:29.741 --> 43:32.677
- Fucking Christ on the cross.
- <i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

43:32.711 --> 43:34.679
This is the first
I'm hearing about all this.

43:35.947 --> 43:39.651
- Was Liddy arrested too?
- Well, no, uh, Liddy got away,

43:39.684 --> 43:41.920
Jeb says, as did Hunt and Baldwin.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.322
Thank the shit Christ.

43:45.190 --> 43:47.625
So there's no direct ties to the campaign.

43:47.659 --> 43:49.894
Well-well, here's the thing, sir.

43:49.928 --> 43:53.131
Uh, McCord did not get away.

43:56.034 --> 43:58.403
Liddy let McCord go in there?

43:58.636 --> 43:59.971
Yes, sir.

44:00.005 --> 44:03.208
I specifically said
I want no one with ties

44:03.241 --> 44:04.976
to the campaign on-site.

44:05.010 --> 44:08.413
Well, apparently we're short on Cubans.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.982
<i>All right, get
the fuck back to D.C. tonight.</i>

44:11.016 --> 44:12.984
<i>You hear me?</i>

44:13.018 --> 44:15.086
The next 48 hours
are gonna be crucial.

44:15.120 --> 44:18.790
We'll have to go low and slow.
Let's not make any big moves.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.091
I-I understand, sir.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.893
Only I was hoping to stop in LA.

44:21.926 --> 44:23.928
We'll regroup the whole team
when we get in.

44:23.962 --> 44:25.930
I'll get Jeb to write up a containment.

44:26.798 --> 44:29.300
Sir, uh, before you go, sir,

44:29.334 --> 44:31.736
uh, one more thing.

44:31.770 --> 44:33.071
I- I don't know how to put this.

44:33.104 --> 44:37.008
Uh, Jeb and I were wondering
about your wife.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.279
What about her?

44:41.312 --> 44:42.414
<i>Well, you know,
I'd- I'd never go</i>

44:42.447 --> 44:43.948
<i>on the record with this, sir,</i>

44:43.982 --> 44:46.785
but McCord did work in your home.

44:46.818 --> 44:48.987
You really think that
when Martha sees his face

44:49.020 --> 44:50.989
in the newspaper, she won't call

44:51.022 --> 44:52.690
one of her journalist friends?

44:52.724 --> 44:53.958
<i>You said it yourself, sir,</i>

44:53.992 --> 44:56.461
<i>the next 48 hours are gonna be crucial.</i>

44:56.694 --> 44:58.329
Listen, Dean, I know you're trying to be

44:58.363 --> 45:00.265
a good little farmhand,
but you're gonna have to get

45:00.298 --> 45:02.901
your dick out of
the butter churn on this one.

45:04.736 --> 45:06.037
<i>You got it?</i>

45:06.071 --> 45:08.907
Yes-yes, sir.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.108
Won't happen again, sir.

45:21.486 --> 45:22.987
What's going on?

45:25.790 --> 45:28.126
You gotta promise you'll tell no one.

45:32.163 --> 45:33.364
I promise.

45:36.835 --> 45:38.837
Dean got himself caught up

45:38.870 --> 45:41.139
in a raid on a Filipino brothel.

45:41.172 --> 45:44.042
He's being forced out of the country.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.211
- You're kidding.
- You didn't hear it from me.

45:48.146 --> 45:51.316
I knew he was an operator
the moment I laid eyes on him.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.253
Oh, his sweet little girlfriend.

45:55.286 --> 45:56.454
She'll be mortified.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.023
Hmm.

45:59.057 --> 46:00.525
This is what happens when there's no trust

46:00.758 --> 46:02.327
between two people.

46:12.203 --> 46:13.838
Now, where were we?

46:15.840 --> 46:18.476
- Oh, yeah.
- Follow me.

46:24.816 --> 46:26.417
Well, well, well,

46:26.451 --> 46:28.553
Mr. Eye For Detail.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.124
You really saved the day here.

46:33.158 --> 46:34.859
Well, I'm just glad
I could represent myself

46:34.893 --> 46:36.528
on behalf of the building.

46:36.561 --> 46:41.432
The big bosses, uh,
have approved a small token

46:41.466 --> 46:44.836
of their appreciation
for your heroic actions

46:44.869 --> 46:46.471
during the course of the break-in.

46:56.915 --> 46:59.417
- What's this?
- <i>It's a raise.</i>

47:01.886 --> 47:03.254
Two fifty?

47:04.222 --> 47:05.323
Every week.

47:12.363 --> 47:13.865
I appreciate it.

47:34.118 --> 47:35.253
Mitchell?

48:13.091 --> 48:16.427
Honeybun? Where are you?

48:16.461 --> 48:18.096
Mitchell?

48:19.197 --> 48:20.898
Marty?

48:20.932 --> 48:22.300
Oh, Jesus.

48:22.333 --> 48:25.336
Oh, Peter, you scared me.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.507
Sorry, ma'am, I was just
getting some breakfast.

48:31.442 --> 48:33.311
Where is everyone?

48:33.344 --> 48:35.947
Oh, your daughter went
to Disneyland with Katarina.

48:36.981 --> 48:38.349
Yes, of course.

48:38.383 --> 48:39.684
And my husband?

48:39.917 --> 48:41.386
Mr. Mitchell had to fly to Washington

48:41.419 --> 48:42.987
for an urgent business meeting.

48:43.021 --> 48:45.089
His instructions
were to have you stay here.

48:46.557 --> 48:47.659
Oh.

48:52.163 --> 48:53.464
I think I'll just, uh...

48:55.233 --> 48:56.234
...give his office a call,

48:56.267 --> 48:57.568
make sure everything's all right.

49:00.038 --> 49:01.939
All right, Peter, seriously,
what is going on?

49:01.973 --> 49:03.041
Where is everyone?

49:03.074 --> 49:04.609
As I said, your husband
had an urgent meeting--

49:04.642 --> 49:07.945
Okay, well, stop saying that
and just tell me.

49:07.979 --> 49:10.348
Okay, there's no need to get hysterical.

49:10.381 --> 49:13.017
Why don't you just go back
to your room and relax?

49:14.619 --> 49:16.654
This is ridiculous.
I am calling my husband.

49:19.057 --> 49:20.425
You are not in charge here.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.126
- Do you understand me?
- Mm-hmm.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.396
Good.

49:25.430 --> 49:28.032
Your husband's a very busy man,

49:28.066 --> 49:30.468
and he doesn't have time
right now to take your call.

49:30.501 --> 49:31.969
Okay.

49:38.009 --> 49:39.210
Here.

49:40.745 --> 49:42.046
A little light reading.

49:48.186 --> 49:49.487
Good girl.

50:10.775 --> 50:12.243
To your right.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.315
To your left.

50:45.576 --> 50:47.545
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
Your party's not answering.</i>

50:47.578 --> 50:49.247
<i>Would you like to try another number?</i>

50:57.088 --> 50:58.689
So am I your date tonight?

51:00.458 --> 51:03.795
Okay, Sandra, you are my date

51:03.828 --> 51:07.532
to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

51:33.191 --> 51:35.259
<i>Should be the last of it.</i>

51:39.697 --> 51:41.599
I saw this in a dream, Howard.

51:43.868 --> 51:47.305
These flames consuming
our best-laid plans.

51:49.273 --> 51:50.641
It's all our fault.

51:52.477 --> 51:54.645
We made too many mistakes,

51:54.679 --> 51:56.314
too many assumptions.

52:00.718 --> 52:03.688
<i>The tide of our ideals</i>

52:03.721 --> 52:07.158
<i>dashed against reality's rocky shore.</i>

52:08.326 --> 52:10.695
<i>How could we have been so foolish</i>

52:10.728 --> 52:12.830
<i>as to not see it coming?</i>

52:12.864 --> 52:14.832
See what coming, Gordon?

52:18.436 --> 52:19.737
Retribution.
