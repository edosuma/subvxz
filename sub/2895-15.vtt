WEBVTT

00:01.133 --> 00:03.074
I just wanted to tell you
that I appreciate you

00:03.075 --> 00:04.275
patching things
up with him.

00:04.359 --> 00:07.862
I would do anything
for the woman that I love.

00:08.029 --> 00:09.530
They are gonna come at us
any way they can,

00:09.698 --> 00:10.948
and when they do,

00:11.083 --> 00:12.523
it's not gonna be
about heat sensors,

00:12.534 --> 00:14.034
it's gonna be about you.

00:14.119 --> 00:16.454
I know I'm not the only guy
in that company

00:16.538 --> 00:18.205
that knows
those sensors are faulty.

00:18.340 --> 00:19.780
I'm sorry, what is it
you need again?

00:19.808 --> 00:22.376
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

00:22.461 --> 00:24.678
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

00:24.796 --> 00:28.215
Have you heard of the National
Transportation Safety Board?

00:28.350 --> 00:31.552
That's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

00:31.720 --> 00:35.389
which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

00:35.557 --> 00:38.609
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

00:38.727 --> 00:41.979
Your whole story about how
Louis got his name on the door

00:42.063 --> 00:43.114
is bullshit.

00:43.231 --> 00:44.365
Jeff.

00:44.483 --> 00:47.451
It's over, Jessica.

00:47.569 --> 00:48.569
We're done.

00:55.243 --> 00:59.046
I can't believe you actually
got them to admit what they did.

00:59.131 --> 01:01.048
You better believe it,
because it's happening,

01:01.133 --> 01:04.501
and it wouldn't be
happening without you.

01:04.635 --> 01:06.420
You mean without me
being greedy.

01:06.505 --> 01:08.088
Joe, that's not
what I was gonna say.

01:08.256 --> 01:10.090
No, no, no, I know that
you don't think I care

01:10.258 --> 01:12.977
about these people,
but I do.

01:13.094 --> 01:14.428
But I'm also a working stiff.

01:14.596 --> 01:17.181
I go paycheck to paycheck
for my whole life,

01:17.265 --> 01:18.432
and then a thing like this--

01:18.567 --> 01:20.401
Could turn your
whole life around.

01:22.487 --> 01:25.105
Guy like you might not be
able to understand that.

01:26.575 --> 01:28.108
I understand.

01:28.193 --> 01:29.944
So it's a done deal?

01:30.028 --> 01:31.529
Might take a few
days to finalize,

01:31.613 --> 01:33.247
but yeah.

01:33.331 --> 01:34.949
It's happening.

01:35.033 --> 01:37.034
You have my word.

01:37.169 --> 01:38.452
You're all right, Mr. Ross.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.927
Harvey, you know the only
times you've been here at night

01:47.012 --> 01:48.295
were the god-awful
dinner party--

01:48.463 --> 01:49.463
And the other time.

01:49.464 --> 01:50.931
Well, this isn't that.

01:51.049 --> 01:52.299
I want to know
why Liberty Rail

01:52.434 --> 01:54.268
has a video of you
in their file room.

01:54.352 --> 01:55.519
What are you talking about?

01:55.637 --> 01:57.237
I'm talking the fact
that our smoking gun

01:57.355 --> 01:58.472
just became inadmissible.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.320
- Harvey--
- How'd you get those documents?

02:00.442 --> 02:02.193
Are you asking
if I did something illegal?

02:02.310 --> 02:03.394
Because I didn't.

02:03.478 --> 02:04.598
Well, they went to the D.A.,

02:04.613 --> 02:06.113
which means they think you did,

02:06.198 --> 02:07.898
so I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

02:08.032 --> 02:09.567
how did you get
in their file room?

02:09.651 --> 02:11.569
By walking through the
door they buzzed open.

02:11.703 --> 02:12.987
And why would they do that?

02:13.071 --> 02:14.154
Because I'm me.

02:14.289 --> 02:15.990
What the hell
does that mean?

02:16.124 --> 02:18.075
It means that I led
the woman to believe

02:18.159 --> 02:19.679
that I was an official
from Washington.

02:19.794 --> 02:21.161
Led them to believe it,

02:21.329 --> 02:22.663
or flat out told them?

02:22.797 --> 02:24.465
Because one kills our case

02:24.583 --> 02:28.919
and the other puts you
in a world of shit.

02:29.004 --> 02:30.137
Harvey, I'm not an idiot,

02:30.222 --> 02:32.022
and I don't appreciate
being treated like one.

02:32.057 --> 02:34.225
I told you I didn't do
anything illegal, and I didn't.

02:34.342 --> 02:35.559
Not an idiot?

02:35.677 --> 02:37.797
What the hell were you doing
there in the first place?

02:37.812 --> 02:39.452
- Harvey.
- It was Mike's idea, wasn't it?

02:39.481 --> 02:43.017
No, he didn't even
know about it.

02:43.151 --> 02:44.685
- Where are you going?
- To see Mike.

02:44.819 --> 02:46.687
I told you, he didn't even
know I was going to do it.

02:46.771 --> 02:49.356
I don't care, because he
sure as hell knew after.

02:49.441 --> 02:50.608
Let's go.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.002 --> 03:04.538
I am so proud of you.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.341
I've done that before.

03:07.425 --> 03:10.544
I'm not talking about that.

03:10.629 --> 03:12.096
I'm talking about your case.

03:12.213 --> 03:13.297
Ah.

03:13.381 --> 03:15.021
You believed in it,
and you fought for it,

03:15.050 --> 03:18.218
and I--
I love that about you.

03:18.353 --> 03:22.473
And I love that you
love that about me.

03:22.557 --> 03:25.059
When a person gives you
a compliment like that,

03:25.193 --> 03:27.061
you're supposed
to give one back.

03:27.228 --> 03:28.445
But I just did.

03:28.563 --> 03:30.403
I said that you love
that I love that about me.

03:30.482 --> 03:31.615
And what if I said I love
that you love that I love that

03:31.733 --> 03:33.317
about you?

03:33.401 --> 03:34.568
How would that make you feel?

03:34.736 --> 03:37.121
So tired.

03:37.238 --> 03:40.407
Well, we both know
why you're so tired.

03:40.542 --> 03:42.042
Yeah, because I'm so good.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.577
Don't you love that about me?

03:51.670 --> 03:53.710
You knew Donna bullshitted
her way into that company

03:53.755 --> 03:56.256
and you let us use
those work orders?

03:56.341 --> 03:57.474
How did you find out?

03:57.592 --> 03:58.926
It doesn't matter
how I found out.

03:59.094 --> 04:00.227
Answer my question.

04:00.312 --> 04:01.929
Yes, I knew, but what
difference does it make? We won.

04:02.063 --> 04:03.263
We didn't win,

04:03.348 --> 04:06.150
because Evan Smith has video
of Donna in their offices.

04:06.267 --> 04:07.434
- What?
- She know about this too?

04:07.569 --> 04:09.249
Harvey, she's just
trying to strong-arm us.

04:09.321 --> 04:10.437
Are you listening to me?

04:10.605 --> 04:12.272
They have the opposing
counsel's secretary

04:12.407 --> 04:14.274
poking around
in their goddamn file room.

04:14.442 --> 04:16.410
If I were the D.A.,
I'd sure as hell look into it.

04:16.528 --> 04:18.245
- The D.A.?
- Yeah, the D.A.

04:18.329 --> 04:19.613
Harvey, they let her in.

04:19.748 --> 04:21.588
According to you,
but they're gonna claim fraud

04:21.616 --> 04:23.334
or theft
or any number of things.

04:23.451 --> 04:25.085
What are you gonna do?

04:25.203 --> 04:27.454
I'm making a deal to drop this
case, that's what I'm gonna do,

04:27.589 --> 04:28.956
and you're gonna file
the paperwork as soon as I do.

04:29.090 --> 04:30.450
So you're just gonna
let this woman

04:30.458 --> 04:31.658
blackmail you without a fight?

04:31.710 --> 04:32.960
You're damn right I am.

04:33.044 --> 04:34.128
Harvey, we can still
win this case and clear--

04:34.262 --> 04:35.462
There is no case,

04:35.547 --> 04:37.297
and I wouldn't give a shit
about it if there was.

04:37.382 --> 04:38.632
I care about Donna.

04:38.767 --> 04:39.633
And you think I don't?

04:39.718 --> 04:40.718
You care so much for her?

04:40.769 --> 04:41.969
Then draw up those papers,

04:42.103 --> 04:44.304

Evan know it's over.

What are you doing here?

05:28.513 --> 05:29.846
We have a situation.

05:30.014 --> 05:32.149
Is the fate of the firm
hanging in the balance?

05:32.266 --> 05:34.518
- No--
- Then I don't give a shit.

05:35.653 --> 05:36.987
You told Malone,
didn't you?

05:40.024 --> 05:42.159
I didn't get a chance
to tell him,

05:42.276 --> 05:43.743
because he had already
figured out

05:43.861 --> 05:45.745
that I had been lying to him
this whole time.

05:47.081 --> 05:50.033
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry.

05:50.168 --> 05:52.048
This morning I thought
I was going away with him

05:52.170 --> 05:53.503
for two weeks.

05:53.588 --> 05:54.955
Now I don't know if I'm ever
gonna see him again.

05:55.039 --> 05:56.456
He quit?

05:56.574 --> 05:59.009
He didn't get around
to giving me his career plans.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.877
You want me to talk to him
for you?

06:00.962 --> 06:03.880
No, this is my mess.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.682
And I will take care
of it myself.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.046
You can take care of it
tomorrow.

06:07.051 --> 06:09.052
Right now,
I'm making you a drink.

06:15.693 --> 06:17.978
Zipadeedoodah
or Grab My Sack?

06:18.062 --> 06:19.479
- What?
- Messenger service.

06:19.564 --> 06:20.564
Which one do we use?

06:20.615 --> 06:21.731
- I-I--
- You know what?

06:21.866 --> 06:23.400
Use whoever you want.
Just take care of it.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.084
Louis, don't you have
your own secretary?

06:25.203 --> 06:27.070
Oh, you mean Norma,
who I can't find anywhere,

06:27.205 --> 06:28.655
who is probably taking
the day off again?

06:28.789 --> 06:30.907
Last year, she tried to get
Arbor Day off,

06:31.042 --> 06:33.482
and I told her to blow a goddamn
tree and get her ass in here.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.578
You know what,
Louis?

06:34.712 --> 06:37.414
Norma has taken 4 days off
in the last 36 years.

06:37.548 --> 06:39.068
Why don't you back
the hell off of her.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.584
What the hell is the matter
with you?

06:40.718 --> 06:42.752
You usually jump on
the Norma bashing train

06:42.920 --> 06:44.838
like a hobo in a 1940s
action movie.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.973
- I'm sorry; I just--
- What?

06:49.594 --> 06:51.428
I bullshitted my way
into Liberty Rail

06:51.562 --> 06:52.596
to get some documents.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.763
They caught me on video,

06:53.898 --> 06:55.658
and now they're threatening
to press charges.

06:59.937 --> 07:01.017
You're not saying anything.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.939
It's nothing.
It's fine.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.692
Then why did you look
so concerned?

07:05.776 --> 07:08.028
I was concerned,
but they're threatening charges,

07:08.162 --> 07:09.579
which means
they want something,

07:09.697 --> 07:11.748
and I know Harvey,
and whatever it is they want,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.366
he'll find a way
to give it to him.

07:13.451 --> 07:15.001
Okay.

07:15.119 --> 07:17.087
Thanks, Louis.

07:17.171 --> 07:18.338
I'll take care
of your stuff.

07:18.456 --> 07:19.896
No, no.
You have enough on your mind.

07:19.924 --> 07:22.375
I'll take care of it myself.

07:26.130 --> 07:29.432
Mr. Specter,
don't tell me.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.885
You're here to talk
about Ms. Paulsen.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.937
I'm here to tell you
you made your point.

07:34.055 --> 07:35.605
And what point is that?

07:35.690 --> 07:37.440
If you drop any charges
against Donna,

07:37.525 --> 07:38.885
we'll drop the lawsuit
against you.

07:38.976 --> 07:41.027
Well, that's not
a very even trade.

07:41.145 --> 07:44.564
I'm giving your client the
chance to get away with murder.

07:44.649 --> 07:46.983
Last I checked, my client wasn't
being charged with murder,

07:47.118 --> 07:48.652
and I don't need you
to drop your suit,

07:48.786 --> 07:49.869
because you have no case.

07:49.987 --> 07:51.037
No case?

07:51.155 --> 07:53.657
Your client put a faulty train
on those tracks,

07:53.741 --> 07:56.022
people died, and they knew
it could happen the whole time.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.043
And you have no proof.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.411
And where I come from,

07:58.496 --> 08:00.547
you cut a deal with me
to make sure I stop looking.

08:00.665 --> 08:03.333
Then I guess we come
from different places,

08:03.417 --> 08:05.657
because I didn't give that video
to the district attorney

08:05.670 --> 08:07.637
to leverage you into a deal.

08:07.722 --> 08:10.507
I did it to blow you out
of the water.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.842
This is a person's life.

08:13.010 --> 08:14.844
Maybe you should have
thought of that

08:14.979 --> 08:17.430
before you sent her
to rob my client.

08:17.565 --> 08:21.484
Evan,
I care about this woman.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.819
Look, I understand.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.438
She's probably worked for you
for a long time.

08:25.523 --> 08:27.123
Maybe you sleep together
once in a while.

08:27.191 --> 08:29.526
But my job is to defend
my client

08:29.660 --> 08:31.778
to the best of my abilities,

08:31.862 --> 08:34.780
and that's exactly what
I'm going to do.

08:48.546 --> 08:50.463
Holy shit.

08:50.548 --> 08:53.600
You can't possible have
a check already.

08:53.718 --> 08:57.554
I don't have a check,
Joe.

08:57.722 --> 08:59.022
We have to drop the case.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.506
What the hell are you
talking about?

09:00.558 --> 09:01.558
We had drinks last night.

09:01.692 --> 09:03.360
Yeah, we also had proof
last night,

09:03.477 --> 09:04.561
and now we don't.

09:04.695 --> 09:06.062
- Why not?
- It's complicated.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.864
You know,
it's a lot of legal rigmarole--

09:07.982 --> 09:09.399
- Hey, don't talk down to me.
- I'm not talking down to you.

09:09.533 --> 09:10.813
But I'm also
not gonna stand here

09:10.818 --> 09:12.035
and explain civil procedure.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.903
Maybe I don't understand
civil procedure,

09:14.038 --> 09:17.073
but I know enough to understand
when something doesn't add up.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.075
We got the evidence
the wrong way.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.493
Well,
get it the right way.

09:20.578 --> 09:21.578
Subpoena it or something.

09:21.579 --> 09:22.829
I can't.

09:22.913 --> 09:24.464
What do you mean,
you can't?

09:24.582 --> 09:25.982
That money was gonna
change my life.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.584
And if you want to go to
a different law firm,

09:27.752 --> 09:29.052
I understand.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.971
You know as well as I do nobody
else is gonna take this case.

09:32.089 --> 09:34.557
You told me you cared
about these people.

09:34.642 --> 09:35.925
You gave me your word.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.762
Yeah, and I wish I could
keep it.

09:38.929 --> 09:41.009
I want those bastards
as much as you want this money,

09:41.098 --> 09:42.098
but I've got no proof,

09:42.233 --> 09:43.553
and you're not
a credible witness.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.402
- Oh, that bullshit again.
- That's not bullshit.

09:45.486 --> 09:47.404
If you had been straight with me
from day one,

09:47.521 --> 09:49.072
we wouldn't even be in
this mess.

09:51.108 --> 09:53.410
How much did they give you
to dump the case?

09:54.528 --> 09:55.528
Had to be something.

09:55.613 --> 09:57.497
Otherwise,
you wouldn't sell me out.

10:01.836 --> 10:03.369
I'm sorry, Joe.
It's over.

10:03.454 --> 10:07.957
You're sorry?

10:14.849 --> 10:17.767
Jessica.

10:17.885 --> 10:18.885
Do you need something?

10:18.886 --> 10:21.137
I came by earlier,
and you weren't in.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.139
I had a meeting, and I
really didn't think you wanted

10:23.307 --> 10:24.724
to be looped in
on my schedule.

10:24.809 --> 10:26.559
I don't,
and I'm not checking up on you.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.145
I just didn't know if you
were coming in.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.781
You mean you weren't sure
if I was ever coming in again.

10:31.866 --> 10:34.067
You wouldn't be the first person
to leave a job

10:34.201 --> 10:35.485
for personal reasons.

10:35.619 --> 10:37.487
It sounds to me like you have
an agenda.

10:39.123 --> 10:40.957
- I don't.
- Well, that's a first.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.044
Are you saying that I came here
to push you out?

10:45.162 --> 10:47.664
I'm saying that I've never known
you not to know what you want.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.499
What I want is to talk
about us,

10:49.633 --> 10:50.967
but you don't seem to want
to do that,

10:51.051 --> 10:54.921
so I'm focusing on this.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.673
I'm not resigning
my senior partnership

10:56.807 --> 10:58.641
the day after
what happened happened,

10:58.759 --> 11:00.059
if that's what
you're asking.

11:00.177 --> 11:03.646
I'm asking if you plan
to resign it at all.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.045
And I can't tell you that
right now, because I don't know.

11:06.150 --> 11:07.350
Well,
when will you know?

11:07.518 --> 11:09.519
Look, Jessica,
you're the managing partner,

11:09.687 --> 11:11.938
so if you want to push me out,
push me out,

11:12.072 --> 11:13.907
but if you're asking me
what I want to do,

11:14.024 --> 11:16.409
I'm telling you
that I haven't decided.

11:27.538 --> 11:28.538
How did it go?

11:28.622 --> 11:30.456
Never mind how it went.

11:30.591 --> 11:32.375
Where's Mike.
Did he file those papers?

11:32.510 --> 11:34.030
I-I-I don't know.
He's not even in yet.

11:34.044 --> 11:35.604
Well, you tell him
not to file anything,

11:35.679 --> 11:37.514
and you tell him to do
whatever he has to

11:37.631 --> 11:38.671
to stick it to that woman.

11:38.716 --> 11:39.799
Why?

11:39.884 --> 11:41.518
Because it didn't work.

11:42.636 --> 11:43.887
What didn't work?

11:44.021 --> 11:47.023
I tried to make a deal with Evan
to trade the case.

11:47.141 --> 11:49.559
You mean you offered to drop
the case in exchange for me.

11:49.727 --> 11:50.810
Yes.

11:52.696 --> 11:53.646
And now what are we gonna do?

11:53.731 --> 11:54.864
You're not gonna do anything.

11:54.949 --> 11:56.366
I'm gonna do
whatever I have to

11:56.450 --> 11:57.984
to get Terrance Wolf
to back off.

11:58.068 --> 12:01.404
Harvey, there's no way the D.A.
handles a case like this himself

12:01.488 --> 12:02.822
just because I work for you.

12:02.957 --> 12:04.908
Whether he handles it himself
or not doesn't matter,

12:04.992 --> 12:07.410
because this case won't even
exist in another hour.

12:14.959 --> 12:16.160
How did it go?

12:16.327 --> 12:17.661
I just told a man
that everything

12:17.796 --> 12:18.745
I promised him was bullshit.

12:18.830 --> 12:19.830
How do you think it went?

12:19.914 --> 12:20.998
Oh, Mike, I'm sorry.

12:21.082 --> 12:24.001
Oh, you should have seen
his face.

12:24.135 --> 12:25.669
That money was gonna change
his life,

12:25.753 --> 12:27.993
and then I dangled it in front
of him and ripped it away.

12:28.006 --> 12:29.166
Yeah,
but it's not your fault.

12:29.257 --> 12:31.058
You did everything you could.

12:31.176 --> 12:32.643
He accused me
of selling out.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.840
You know you didn't
do that.

12:33.845 --> 12:34.928
Didn't I?

12:35.013 --> 12:36.013
We gave up because--

12:36.064 --> 12:37.598
Of me?

12:40.685 --> 12:41.819
That's not what I
was gonna say.

12:41.903 --> 12:42.903
Yeah, it was.

12:43.021 --> 12:44.501
No, I was gonna say
because of Harvey.

12:44.522 --> 12:45.602
What are you talking about?

12:45.657 --> 12:47.137
Harvey never wanted
to take this case,

12:47.192 --> 12:48.609
so he put a clock on it
to get me to drop it.

12:48.743 --> 12:50.194
That's why we're where we are
right now.

12:50.278 --> 12:52.029
Listen to me;
Harvey is out there right now

12:52.163 --> 12:53.664
busting his ass
to fix everything.

12:53.781 --> 12:55.032
No, Donna.

12:55.116 --> 12:56.917
He doesn't give a shit about
this case, and he never did.

12:57.035 --> 12:58.585
Then why did he send me here
to tell you to do

12:58.703 --> 13:00.787
everything you can to stick it
to Evan Smith?

13:00.922 --> 13:02.789
She didn't take the deal,
did she?

13:02.874 --> 13:04.875
No, she didn't.

13:05.009 --> 13:06.009
Donna, I'm sorry.

13:06.094 --> 13:07.678
I didn't realize
that you were still--

13:07.762 --> 13:08.879
On the hot seat?

13:09.013 --> 13:12.015
Like I said, Harvey's
busting his ass to fix it,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.967
which means
he's gonna fix it.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.554
Now, finish what we started
and figure out a way

13:17.689 --> 13:20.891
to win this case.

13:26.564 --> 13:28.732
Harvey Specter.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.484
I was wondering when you
would show up.

13:30.568 --> 13:31.848
That's funny;
I was wondering why

13:31.903 --> 13:33.263
you never sent me
a Christmas card.

13:33.321 --> 13:34.872
Ha-ha.

13:34.956 --> 13:36.456
You don't seem
the least bit worried

13:36.574 --> 13:38.792
about the pending charges
against your secretary.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.744
I'm not,
because she did nothing wrong.

13:40.879 --> 13:42.079
Well,
you know what I think?

13:42.213 --> 13:44.748
I think you wouldn't be here
if she did nothing wrong.

13:44.883 --> 13:47.000
Listen to me.
She didn't steal anything.

13:47.135 --> 13:49.720
She got those documents by
convincing them to let her in,

13:49.804 --> 13:50.804
and that is not a crime.

13:50.805 --> 13:52.556
And the last time
you were in my office,

13:52.640 --> 13:55.592
you told me you hadn't committed
a crime to get the job done.

13:55.677 --> 13:57.561
After I told you
you had an innocent man,

13:57.679 --> 14:00.764
and all you cared about
was procedure.

14:00.848 --> 14:02.816
All I cared about
was the law.

14:02.934 --> 14:05.435
Well, if you're so concerned
with people breaking the law,

14:05.570 --> 14:07.187
why don't you take a look
at those documents?

14:07.322 --> 14:10.107
Because they prove Liberty Rail
actually committed a crime,

14:10.241 --> 14:12.161
unlike Donna, whose only crime
is working for me.

14:12.277 --> 14:14.194
I'm not investigating her
for working for you.

14:14.279 --> 14:16.613
I'm investigating her
for felony fraud.

14:16.748 --> 14:18.749
What the hell are you
talking about?

14:21.202 --> 14:24.955
The woman that let her in
swears your secretary told her

14:25.089 --> 14:27.958
she was with the National
Transportation Safety Board.

14:28.042 --> 14:30.127
That's a federal agency,

14:30.261 --> 14:33.463
which makes what she did
not a trick.

14:33.631 --> 14:36.183
It makes it felony fraud.

14:40.805 --> 14:42.689
My office.
Now.

14:45.693 --> 14:48.061
Close the door.

14:48.196 --> 14:49.062
Harvey, what happened?

14:49.147 --> 14:50.564
What happened is,
you lied to me.

14:50.698 --> 14:51.782
What are you talking about?

14:51.866 --> 14:53.867
You told their secretary
you were with the NTSB?

14:53.985 --> 14:56.820
- That's not what I said.
- Bullshit.

14:56.955 --> 14:57.821
I know
when I've been lied to.

14:57.956 --> 14:58.989
Come clean right now.

14:59.123 --> 15:00.490
I--

15:00.625 --> 15:03.160
- Right the hell now.
- I never said I was with them.

15:03.294 --> 15:04.544
I said,
"Have you ever heard of

15:04.662 --> 15:06.663
the National Transportation
Safety Board?

15:06.798 --> 15:07.965
How is that any different?

15:08.049 --> 15:09.883
- I'm sorry, I--
- You're sorry?

15:10.001 --> 15:12.201
Harvey, I swear I didn't know
that that made it a crime.

15:12.303 --> 15:13.804
You knew when I point-blank
asked you,

15:13.888 --> 15:15.505
and you lied to me about it.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.008
Well, I thought that you
would take care of it.

15:18.092 --> 15:20.510
How can I take care of it if you
don't tell me the goddamn truth?

15:20.645 --> 15:22.562
Do you think that I didn't want
to tell you the truth?

15:22.680 --> 15:25.148
- Then why didn't you?
- Because I was ashamed.

15:26.901 --> 15:29.019
I know that it sounds stupid,

15:29.187 --> 15:31.688
but you and Mike and everyone
pull these rabbits

15:31.856 --> 15:33.824
out of your hats all the time,
and I just sit outside,

15:33.908 --> 15:36.026
and I answer the phones.

15:36.194 --> 15:39.663
And then I got those documents,
and people said I saved the day.

15:39.781 --> 15:41.999
And the next thing I knew,
you were on my doorstep

15:42.116 --> 15:44.001
coming at me like I was
some sort of criminal,

15:44.118 --> 15:48.455
and I panicked,
and I lied.

15:48.589 --> 15:50.874
- Donna--
- I'm sorry, Harvey.

15:50.958 --> 15:53.377
I know you are,
but this just got

15:53.511 --> 15:55.595
1,000 times harder for me
to get out of.

15:57.181 --> 15:58.682
You mean for you
to get me out of.

15:58.766 --> 16:01.184
Donna, you of all people
should understand by now

16:01.269 --> 16:02.719
that to me
they're the same thing.

16:12.697 --> 16:14.398
What are you doing here?

16:14.565 --> 16:16.533
I went to see you at work.
They said you called in sick.

16:16.617 --> 16:18.201
I said,
what are you doing here?

16:18.286 --> 16:20.454
I wanted to tell you
the good news.

16:20.571 --> 16:22.011
I'm not dropping your case
after all.

16:22.073 --> 16:23.907
Good for you.

16:23.991 --> 16:25.909
Hey, Joe.

16:26.044 --> 16:27.544
I know you've been
jerked around,

16:27.628 --> 16:29.913
but things
are gonna change.

16:30.048 --> 16:31.415
Gonna change?
Really?

16:31.582 --> 16:34.134
I thought you said you got
the evidence in the wrong way.

16:34.252 --> 16:36.553
Well, and you said we should
get it in the right way,

16:36.637 --> 16:38.422
so that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

16:38.556 --> 16:41.091
Like I said, good for you, but
you're not gonna do it with me.

16:41.259 --> 16:42.893
Hey, Joe.

16:43.010 --> 16:45.846
I can't subpoena those records
without the legitimate client.

16:45.980 --> 16:48.932
I have no basis and no standing
to move forward if I did.

16:49.016 --> 16:52.486
Oh, now you have time to explain
procedure to me, right?

16:52.603 --> 16:55.021
Okay, fine.
I deserved that.

16:55.156 --> 16:57.991
But, Joe, this case cannot
move forward without you.

16:58.109 --> 17:01.945
You should have thought of that
before you cut me loose.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.447
They got to you,
didn't they?

17:05.199 --> 17:06.916
They gave you a few dollars
to shut you up,

17:07.001 --> 17:08.502
and then they sealed
the agreement

17:08.618 --> 17:09.752
with no admission
of guilt.

17:09.837 --> 17:10.921
You know what?

17:11.005 --> 17:13.089
I can't comment on that,
and you know why,

17:13.174 --> 17:15.125
but let's get
one thing straight.

17:15.259 --> 17:17.676
They didn't shut me up;
you did.

17:17.795 --> 17:18.878
And if I took anything,

17:18.963 --> 17:20.630
it was because I had
no other choice.

17:20.765 --> 17:22.048
Joe,
listen to me.

17:22.133 --> 17:24.184
If the check hasn't cleared,
we can still get out of it.

17:24.301 --> 17:25.801
Don't come by here anymore.

17:27.188 --> 17:29.439
So much for really caring
about those people.

17:31.976 --> 17:33.477
Go to hell.

17:41.732 --> 17:43.433
I thought nobody puts baby
in the corner.

17:43.517 --> 17:44.684
Since when am I "baby"?

17:44.818 --> 17:46.235
Since you're sitting
in the corner.

17:46.353 --> 17:48.104
You're usually a power table
kind of girl.

17:48.188 --> 17:50.490
Well,
I'm not tonight.

17:51.742 --> 17:53.576
Jessica,
what's going on?

17:54.945 --> 17:57.363
It's over
between me and Jeff.

17:57.531 --> 17:59.082
What?
What happened?

17:59.199 --> 18:00.833
It's not important.

18:00.951 --> 18:03.369
One day the man is calling me
about taking you to Paris,

18:03.537 --> 18:04.671
and the next it's over,

18:04.788 --> 18:06.508
and the reason for all that
isn't important?

18:06.540 --> 18:07.780
No, it isn't,
because right now,

18:07.875 --> 18:09.915
I have to decide whether
he should stay at the firm.

18:09.927 --> 18:11.678
Well, then I'd say the reason
that you broke up is important.

18:11.762 --> 18:13.262
And I don't want to get into it
right now,

18:13.380 --> 18:15.181
because it's not going
to change.

18:15.265 --> 18:18.718
Wow,
heard that before.

18:18.852 --> 18:22.805
Leah, I'm not like Dad,
and I'm tired of hearing it.

18:22.940 --> 18:24.807
I know you always say
you're not like him,

18:24.959 --> 18:27.393
but here you are scrubbing up
for the next surgery

18:27.528 --> 18:29.362
instead of fighting for the man
that you love.

18:29.446 --> 18:31.397
You know what?

18:31.532 --> 18:35.068
Most sisters would say,
"I'm sorry, Jessica,"

18:35.152 --> 18:36.369
and then give me a hug.

18:36.487 --> 18:38.571
Jessica, I am sorry
that you're hurting,

18:38.739 --> 18:40.219
and if you want something
sugarcoated,

18:40.240 --> 18:43.292
I'll order you dessert, but that
is not how we show support.

18:43.410 --> 18:45.628
You're right.

18:45.746 --> 18:50.717
We show it by telling each other
what we think, so...

18:50.801 --> 18:53.419
And what I think is,

18:53.554 --> 18:56.339
two days ago,
this man loved you.

18:56.473 --> 18:58.758
So unless you cheated on him,
stole from him,

18:58.892 --> 19:02.478
or killed somebody,
it seems to me the two of you

19:02.596 --> 19:04.731
should be able to get past
whatever it is you did do.

19:12.272 --> 19:14.357
Joe Henderson backed out.

19:16.443 --> 19:19.612
Harvey,
did you hear me?

19:19.747 --> 19:21.447
They paid him off.
We have no case anymore.

19:21.615 --> 19:23.700
And right now,
I have a bigger problem.

19:23.834 --> 19:24.701
Donna lied.

19:24.785 --> 19:26.369
What do you mean,
she lied?

19:26.503 --> 19:29.122
I mean she didn't just bullshit
her way into that file room.

19:29.256 --> 19:31.591
She used the words "National
Transportation Safety Board."

19:31.692 --> 19:33.126
In what context?

19:33.260 --> 19:35.795
In the context of committing
a crime to help you.

19:35.879 --> 19:38.431
Are you accusing me of knowing
that she did that?

19:38.515 --> 19:40.633
If you didn't know, it's because
you didn't want to know.

19:40.718 --> 19:42.301
Harvey, she told me
she didn't steal those things.

19:42.386 --> 19:43.886
I believed her
the same way you did.

19:43.971 --> 19:45.354
And you lied
just like she did.

19:45.472 --> 19:46.806
I did not lie.

19:46.940 --> 19:49.525
Then how come when I asked you
where those documents came from,

19:49.643 --> 19:51.194
you didn't say one word
about Donna?

19:51.311 --> 19:53.396
Because you wouldn't have
listened to another word

19:53.480 --> 19:55.481
I said after that, and I was
trying to get the job done.

19:55.616 --> 19:57.256
Well, you got the job done
by risking her.

19:57.317 --> 19:59.637
And how is that different than
all the times you risked me?

19:59.653 --> 20:01.404
Because she's different.

20:08.996 --> 20:13.633
Harvey,
I swear I didn't know.

20:13.751 --> 20:16.252
Well, like I said, right now,
I've got a bigger problem.

20:16.336 --> 20:18.721
Donna's gonna be charged
with felony fraud,

20:18.839 --> 20:20.840
and she's guilty.

20:26.230 --> 20:27.680
- Five elements.
- What?

20:27.815 --> 20:29.565
Proving fraud consists
of five elements.

20:29.683 --> 20:31.734
Okay, I'm aware of that,
and they have all of them.

20:31.852 --> 20:33.486
What about injury?

20:33.570 --> 20:35.855
How did Donna injure
Liberty Rail?

20:35.989 --> 20:38.491
- You know how.
- I know, and you know.

20:38.575 --> 20:40.326
But Evan Smith isn't gonna sit
in front of a jury

20:40.410 --> 20:42.495
and explain why
those documents have value

20:42.579 --> 20:45.281
without exposing her client
to criminal charges.

20:45.365 --> 20:46.499
And without damages,

20:46.617 --> 20:49.118
what Donna did is trespassing
at the worst.

20:49.253 --> 20:50.453
What do you want me to do?

20:50.537 --> 20:51.977
I want you to stay
on the civil case.

20:52.005 --> 20:53.256
Harvey,
the lawsuit is dead.

20:53.373 --> 20:54.540
We don't have a plaintiff.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.468
Then get another one,
because I'm not letting

20:56.510 --> 21:01.297
this woman get away
with a goddamn thing.

21:03.267 --> 21:04.550
All right,

21:04.685 --> 21:06.185
I'm paying you the courtesy
of a meeting.

21:06.270 --> 21:07.637
What's on your mind?

21:07.721 --> 21:09.355
Well, based on his reputation,
I would say that

21:09.439 --> 21:11.224
he's going to try to weasel
his way out of this.

21:11.308 --> 21:13.559
What I'm going to do
is save Mr. Wolf

21:13.694 --> 21:15.528
from being embarrassed
in open court.

21:15.646 --> 21:17.980
And I'm sure there's no side
benefit to you in the process.

21:18.065 --> 21:19.148
You do know you're gonna have
to put Ms. Smith

21:19.233 --> 21:20.533
on the stand,
right?

21:20.651 --> 21:22.485
So do you; that's why you
had her come down here.

21:22.569 --> 21:24.704
And did she tell you
what Donna actually took?

21:24.788 --> 21:27.206
You told me what Donna took.

21:27.324 --> 21:30.543
And I also told you that it
proves they committed a crime,

21:30.627 --> 21:34.213
but she can't say that,
which means all Donna stole

21:34.298 --> 21:35.832
was a meaningless stack
of papers,

21:35.916 --> 21:37.500
and without actual damages--

21:37.634 --> 21:38.668
I know the law.

21:38.752 --> 21:40.392
Then you know you've got
a shitty witness.

21:44.892 --> 21:46.509
Well?

21:46.643 --> 21:48.523
I can't get into the details
of those documents,

21:48.595 --> 21:50.396
but that doesn't mean
that they don't have value.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.398
Of course they have value.
The saved you ass.

21:52.516 --> 21:54.767
They're confidential.
They have trade secrets.

21:54.902 --> 21:56.519
The only secret
that is in there

21:56.603 --> 21:57.843
is that your trains
kill people.

21:57.938 --> 21:59.605
All right, enough.

21:59.773 --> 22:04.577
Ms. Smith,
if you can't show damages,

22:04.695 --> 22:06.162
I have no case.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.280
You don't need damages.

22:07.414 --> 22:08.414
You have intent.

22:08.498 --> 22:10.366
And if you really knew
my reputation,

22:10.450 --> 22:12.201
you'd also know
that I used to work here.

22:12.286 --> 22:15.421
And I can tell you they've never
gone after anyone for intent

22:15.505 --> 22:16.923
in the history
of the D.A.'s office,

22:17.007 --> 22:18.541
and they're not gonna
start now.

22:18.625 --> 22:20.265
It was good doing business
with you, Evan.

22:31.471 --> 22:32.471
Hey.

22:32.472 --> 22:34.473
Hey.
How are things?

22:34.608 --> 22:36.275
You mean the things
that you said that Harvey

22:36.360 --> 22:37.393
would take care of?

22:37.527 --> 22:39.228
Yes, those are exactly
the things I mean.

22:39.313 --> 22:40.780
Well,
those are exactly the things

22:40.864 --> 22:42.648
that Harvey
just took care of.

22:42.783 --> 22:43.783
He did?

22:43.817 --> 22:48.871
He did.

22:51.658 --> 22:54.327
Louis,
what's wrong?

22:54.461 --> 22:55.711
Nothing's wrong.

22:55.829 --> 22:58.831
It's just...
I know it wasn't gonna happen,

22:58.999 --> 23:03.836
but when you first told me
they might press charges,

23:03.971 --> 23:06.222
the thought of you
behind bars...

23:07.674 --> 23:09.342
Oh, come on.

23:09.509 --> 23:12.345
It just would have been
some cushy, white-collar resort.

23:12.512 --> 23:14.512
I could have finally gotten
my yoga certification--

23:14.514 --> 23:17.650
It wouldn't have been.

23:17.734 --> 23:19.518
But it doesn't matter,
because I was right.

23:19.653 --> 23:21.654
Harvey did whatever it took.

23:24.441 --> 23:25.691
Thanks, Louis.

23:25.826 --> 23:28.527
God, he doesn't even know
how lucky he is to have you.

23:30.330 --> 23:31.614
Norma's still out,
isn't she?

23:31.748 --> 23:33.449
Her goddamn sister tripped
and fell in the tub,

23:33.583 --> 23:34.834
and she went to help.

23:34.952 --> 23:37.370
It's like she doesn't even care
about me at all.

23:51.051 --> 23:52.051
I know you don't work
in maintenance,

23:52.185 --> 23:54.136
but you do have access
to accounts payable,

23:54.271 --> 23:55.438
so if you could...

23:55.555 --> 23:58.774
look--no--hey, please,
just hear me...

23:58.892 --> 24:01.727
God damn it.

24:01.812 --> 24:04.313
Another one wouldn't take
your call?

24:04.448 --> 24:05.531
No, none of them will.

24:05.649 --> 24:07.400
I've been through
this entire directory.

24:07.534 --> 24:09.235
As soon as I use the words
"crash," "heat," or "sensors,"

24:09.403 --> 24:10.403
they all stop talking.

24:10.454 --> 24:11.537
Mike, people died.

24:11.621 --> 24:13.456
Somebody's got to want to do
the right thing.

24:13.573 --> 24:15.324
Well, if somebody does,
I can't find them.

24:15.409 --> 24:16.909
Okay what about
the victims' families?

24:16.994 --> 24:18.434
Oh, you mean
the original plaintiffs.

24:18.578 --> 24:21.297
Yeah, the problem is,
they already have a settlement.

24:21.415 --> 24:22.415
Go on.
Look at it.

24:22.549 --> 24:23.749
They weren't stupid.

24:23.884 --> 24:25.217
It prevents them from ever
going after them again.

24:25.302 --> 24:28.554
Mike,
I'm just trying to help you.

24:28.672 --> 24:29.839
I know you are.
I'm sorry.

24:29.923 --> 24:31.590
I'm just frustrated.

24:31.675 --> 24:34.176
If I can't find a new plaintiff,
I can't keep this case alive.

24:34.261 --> 24:36.395
Wait a second.

24:36.480 --> 24:39.565
You said no one at the company
will talk to you.

24:39.683 --> 24:42.123
They won't, because they're all
afraid they'll lose their job.

24:42.185 --> 24:44.687
All right, so what about someone
who has nothing left to lose?

24:46.523 --> 24:48.858
What are you talking about?

24:48.992 --> 24:51.744
I'm talking about him.

24:54.915 --> 24:57.750
So I rescheduled the meeting
that you missed with Latham

24:57.868 --> 24:59.251
for 3:00 tomorrow.

24:59.369 --> 25:00.569
Here are the newest contracts.

25:00.620 --> 25:02.872
Also, Kathy Finn called
about the takeover,

25:03.006 --> 25:05.624
so I sent her the latest specs,
and I told her to sit tight.

25:05.759 --> 25:07.793
And I noticed the left pen on
your desk set was out of ink,

25:07.961 --> 25:09.345
so I had the cartridge
replaced.

25:09.463 --> 25:11.630
You could have done all of this
while I was out of the office.

25:11.765 --> 25:13.849
I know, but then I wouldn't have
had a chance to thank you.

25:13.967 --> 25:15.468
Donna.

25:15.635 --> 25:17.803
Thank you, Harvey.

25:17.888 --> 25:19.638
You're welcome.

25:19.806 --> 25:22.308
Ms. Paulsen, Mr. Specter.

25:22.442 --> 25:25.277
Terrance, you better be here
to give Donna a formal apology

25:25.362 --> 25:26.479
from the D.A.'s office.

25:26.613 --> 25:28.280
No.

25:28.365 --> 25:31.067
I'm here to give
her lawyer this.

25:34.621 --> 25:35.488
Harvey, what is that?

25:35.572 --> 25:36.655
Donna,
leave the room.

25:36.740 --> 25:37.873
You can tell her to leave.

25:37.991 --> 25:39.492
Don't forget to tell her
her arraignment's

25:39.576 --> 25:40.543
at 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

25:40.660 --> 25:41.710
Arraignment?
For what?

25:41.828 --> 25:42.828
You son of a bitch.

25:42.829 --> 25:44.547
You amended the charges
to intent?

25:44.664 --> 25:46.082
You said it's never been done

25:46.216 --> 25:47.666
in the history
of the D.A.'s office.

25:47.801 --> 25:49.335
I decided to make history.

25:49.419 --> 25:51.587
By going after someone
for stealing nothing.

25:51.721 --> 25:53.589
She went in there to find
the Hope Diamond.

25:53.723 --> 25:55.808
Just because she came out
with a piece of glass

25:55.892 --> 25:57.309
doesn't mean
it wasn't fraud.

25:57.394 --> 25:58.644
That's exactly what it means.

25:58.762 --> 26:00.429
Every time I run into you,

26:00.514 --> 26:03.516
you tell me whatever shady thing
just went down

26:03.683 --> 26:06.685
was about the greater good
or that it didn't happen

26:06.770 --> 26:10.239
or this, that, or the other,
but a crime was committed here,

26:10.357 --> 26:11.440
and I'm going after her
for it.

26:11.525 --> 26:13.409
Bullshit.
You're going after me.

26:13.527 --> 26:15.828
Oh, you're telling me
you didn't order her to do it.

26:15.912 --> 26:17.196
No, I didn't.

26:17.330 --> 26:19.498
Well, we'll find out...

26:19.583 --> 26:21.867
when she's about
to be convicted

26:22.035 --> 26:26.589
and I offer her a deal.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.974
What happens now?

26:34.058 --> 26:36.443
What happens now is,
we go in there tomorrow

26:36.527 --> 26:38.895
and enter a plea
of not guilty.

26:38.980 --> 26:40.230
But I am guilty.

26:40.364 --> 26:43.016
Donna, intent to commit fraud
is a bullshit charge,

26:43.151 --> 26:44.871
and he's just using you
to try to scare you.

26:44.952 --> 26:46.820
Well, it's working.
I'm scared.

26:46.954 --> 26:48.655
- Donna--
- What's the punishment?

26:48.790 --> 26:50.950
It doesn't matter, because
I'm gonna get you out of it.

26:50.958 --> 26:53.160
Harvey,
what's the punishment?

26:54.328 --> 26:55.328
Three to five years.

26:55.379 --> 26:57.330
Oh, my God.

26:57.465 --> 26:59.385
- Three to five years for what?
- Not now, Louis.

26:59.467 --> 27:01.168
I just saw Terrance Wolf
at the elevator.

27:01.335 --> 27:03.303
Three to five years for what?

27:03.387 --> 27:06.173
He's charging her with intent
to commit fraud.

27:06.307 --> 27:07.174
Holy shit.

27:07.258 --> 27:08.975
Louis,
I don't want to hear it.

27:09.093 --> 27:10.177
Well, you're going to,
because you were supposed to

27:10.311 --> 27:11.311
get her out of this.

27:11.345 --> 27:12.345
This isn't helping.

27:12.396 --> 27:14.076
What the hell do you think
I've been doing?

27:14.098 --> 27:15.232
I don't know, but whatever
it is, it didn't do a thing.

27:15.349 --> 27:16.683
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:16.851 --> 27:18.985
I told her that you were never
gonna let her get in trouble.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.070
It's not so simple.

27:20.104 --> 27:21.264
What the hell
isn't so simple?

27:21.272 --> 27:23.190
She's guilty.

27:23.324 --> 27:25.108
Wolf is trying to use her
to turn on me,

27:25.193 --> 27:26.726
because he thinks
I put her up to it.

27:26.828 --> 27:28.028
Did you?

27:28.162 --> 27:29.442
Harvey didn't even know
I did it.

27:29.530 --> 27:30.780
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.699
- Because I'm taking over.
- No, you're not.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.167
He's trying to get her
to turn on you.

27:34.285 --> 27:35.669
You cannot be her lawyer.

27:35.753 --> 27:37.871
She's not going to,
so what difference does it make?

27:38.005 --> 27:40.757
The difference is, if you're out
of the picture, Wolf backs down.

27:40.875 --> 27:43.043
From where he's standing,
I'm in the picture,

27:43.127 --> 27:44.427
and he's never gonna
back down.

27:44.545 --> 27:46.345
You don't know that,
and this is Donna's life.

27:46.347 --> 27:47.787
And I'm not putting it
in your hands.

27:47.798 --> 27:49.158
And it's not your decision
to make.

27:49.183 --> 27:50.967
No, it's not.
It's Donna's.

27:51.052 --> 27:52.853
And she's sticking with me.

27:58.025 --> 28:00.694
Louis, please,
I know that you want to help,

28:00.811 --> 28:01.811
but just go.

28:19.830 --> 28:21.631
- Mr. Jaworski.
- Yeah.

28:21.749 --> 28:23.789
My name is Mike Ross.
I'm with Pearson Specter Litt.

28:23.834 --> 28:24.968
This is Rachel Zane.

28:25.086 --> 28:26.803
She's one of our associates.

28:26.921 --> 28:28.961
Sir, we'd like to speak with you
about the accident.

28:28.973 --> 28:31.641
Look, I was already deposed
for that lawsuit.

28:31.759 --> 28:32.809
The victims got paid.

28:32.927 --> 28:34.367
I said everything
I had to say, okay?

28:34.428 --> 28:36.646
We're not here
to come after you.

28:36.764 --> 28:38.098
We want you to sue
Liberty Rail.

28:38.182 --> 28:39.432
Oh, yeah?
And why would I sue them?

28:39.517 --> 28:41.735
'Cause while you might have been
driving the train,

28:41.819 --> 28:43.103
that accident wasn't your fault.

28:43.237 --> 28:44.938
Is this some kind of a joke?

28:45.072 --> 28:46.156
No, sir.
It isn't.

28:46.274 --> 28:47.774
They made you the fall guy.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.194
Bullshit.
Why would they do that?

28:51.329 --> 28:52.946
Because they needed
to blame someone,

28:53.080 --> 28:54.831
and not only were you
at the wheel,

28:54.949 --> 28:56.333
you had no memory
of what happened.

28:56.450 --> 28:59.035
Nah,
I don't believe it.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.087
They're a good company.
They wouldn't do this.

29:01.205 --> 29:02.339
Mr. Jaworski--

29:02.456 --> 29:03.673
Look,
I killed those people.

29:04.792 --> 29:06.312
And they still gave me
early retirement

29:06.377 --> 29:07.711
and let me keep my pension.

29:07.795 --> 29:09.846
The reason they did that
was to keep you quiet.

29:13.517 --> 29:15.302
I need you to get off
my property,

29:15.386 --> 29:17.020
both of you.

29:19.307 --> 29:21.057
Sir, you know that we're telling
the truth.

29:21.142 --> 29:23.062
Yeah, well, is the truth
gonna support the family

29:23.110 --> 29:25.228
of a guy who can't get another
job for the rest of his life?

29:25.363 --> 29:27.030
If we win,
you'll be set up for life.

29:27.148 --> 29:28.148
Ah, take a look at me.

29:28.316 --> 29:30.400
I ain't the guy who wins.

29:30.534 --> 29:32.452
I'm the guy who loses.

29:32.570 --> 29:35.038
What if I can guarantee
to take care of all of that

29:35.156 --> 29:36.373
no matter what happens.

29:40.628 --> 29:42.829
What would you need me to do?

29:43.998 --> 29:44.998
All rise.

29:49.837 --> 29:50.920
You okay?

29:51.055 --> 29:53.056
Mm-hmm.

29:53.174 --> 29:54.391
Am I gonna have to talk?

29:54.508 --> 29:55.908
Just be polite
and say "Your Honor."

29:56.010 --> 29:57.927
It will be over
before you know it.

29:58.012 --> 30:00.146
State versus Donna Paulsen.

30:00.231 --> 30:03.850
Is the defense counsel prepared
to proceed with the arraignment?

30:03.985 --> 30:04.851
We are, Your Honor.

30:04.935 --> 30:06.403
Ms. Paulsen,
you have been charged

30:06.520 --> 30:08.438
with felony intent
to commit fraud.

30:08.522 --> 30:11.491
This carries a maximum sentence
of up to five years in prison.

30:11.609 --> 30:13.693
Do you understand the charges
against you today?

30:13.828 --> 30:15.111
Yes, Your Honor.

30:15.246 --> 30:16.246
How do you plead?

30:18.032 --> 30:19.249
Not guilty,
Your Honor.

30:19.367 --> 30:20.417
Very well.

30:20.534 --> 30:22.752
Mr. Wolf, is the state ready
to go to trial?

30:22.870 --> 30:23.870
We are, Your Honor.

30:23.871 --> 30:25.422
Trial is set
to begin Monday.

30:25.539 --> 30:27.207
Next case.

30:27.291 --> 30:28.875
All right, you made your point.

30:29.010 --> 30:30.490
Let's plead this down
to a misdemeanor

30:30.544 --> 30:32.095
and both go back
to our real jobs.

30:32.213 --> 30:33.880
This is my real job.

30:34.048 --> 30:35.715
Maybe if you had
a little more respect

30:35.800 --> 30:38.718
for what it stands for,
you wouldn't be standing here.

30:38.803 --> 30:41.855
Listen, I'm gonna wipe that look
off your smug face.

30:41.939 --> 30:43.306
You give it a try,
Harvey,

30:43.391 --> 30:45.358
but I've got all the evidence
I need.

30:52.149 --> 30:55.902
You're gonna have to go
find yourself a new secretary.

31:15.556 --> 31:19.142
I see you're back
to not knocking.

31:19.260 --> 31:21.311
I take it that means
you've made up your mind.

31:21.429 --> 31:22.979
I have.

31:23.097 --> 31:24.097
And?

31:24.098 --> 31:26.733
And what I've decided

31:26.817 --> 31:29.102
is that you shut the door
on me the other night,

31:29.236 --> 31:33.022
and it's not fair you to dictate
what I do and don't get to say.

31:33.157 --> 31:34.941
I told you.

31:35.076 --> 31:36.596
It doesn't matter
what you have to say,

31:36.610 --> 31:38.328
because whatever it is,
I won't believe it.

31:38.446 --> 31:43.166
Well, what if I was here
to tell you that I love you?

31:48.172 --> 31:52.425
Jessica,
you lied to me for months--

31:52.510 --> 31:54.761
Jeff, please.

31:54.845 --> 31:58.047
Just listen.

31:58.132 --> 32:00.216
I know I hurt you,

32:00.301 --> 32:02.802
but you were the one

32:02.937 --> 32:06.389
who wanted us to work together
and be in a relationship.

32:06.474 --> 32:08.975
And you were the one who thought
it was a mistake.

32:09.059 --> 32:11.027
Because I was scared.

32:11.145 --> 32:13.897
But I changed my mind,

32:13.981 --> 32:17.867
because you refused
to give up.

32:17.985 --> 32:21.204
And now I'm refusing
to give up.

32:21.322 --> 32:24.157
I want you to stay here.

32:24.241 --> 32:26.826
I want us to have both.

32:29.830 --> 32:30.830
Jessica--

32:30.831 --> 32:35.218
You wanted me to let
my walls down.

32:35.336 --> 32:38.004
Well, they're down.

33:04.365 --> 33:05.845
Donna, why don't you go home?

33:05.866 --> 33:08.117
You know I like to be alone when
I'm getting ready for a trial.

33:08.252 --> 33:10.170
I need to talk to you.

33:10.271 --> 33:11.271
What is it?

33:11.372 --> 33:13.706
I think maybe Louis
was right.

33:13.841 --> 33:16.709
You think Louis was right
about what?

33:16.877 --> 33:18.294
Maybe he should be
handling my case.

33:22.766 --> 33:25.351
Okay, well,
if that's how you feel.

33:25.469 --> 33:27.469
I knew it; I knew you would
take this as an insult.

33:27.555 --> 33:29.222
How exactly would you like me
to take it?

33:29.306 --> 33:30.746
I would like you
to take it seriously

33:30.808 --> 33:32.058
and talk about it with me.

33:32.142 --> 33:35.895
Okay, Donna, why exactly would
you prefer Louis to handle this?

33:36.063 --> 33:37.897
Because I sat
in that arraignment today,

33:38.065 --> 33:39.732
and it hit me
for the first time

33:39.867 --> 33:43.236
that I might actually go
to prison.

33:43.404 --> 33:45.738
And you were more concerned
with attacking Terrance Wolf

33:45.906 --> 33:46.906
than you were with me.

33:46.991 --> 33:48.111
So you think Louis is right.

33:48.209 --> 33:49.709
I piss off the D.A. too much.

33:49.843 --> 33:51.878
- Well, you sure did today.
- Because he's coming at us.

33:51.996 --> 33:53.379
And you're pouring gas
on the fire.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.331
Because that's what I do,
and I don't need you

33:55.416 --> 33:57.967
coming in here second-guessing
how I do my job.

33:58.085 --> 33:59.836
Harvey,
why are you attacking me?

33:59.970 --> 34:00.837
I'm not the enemy.

34:00.921 --> 34:02.005
You sure as hell are right now.

34:02.139 --> 34:03.389
What?
Why am I the--

34:03.474 --> 34:04.974
Because I'm getting ready
for a fight,

34:05.092 --> 34:06.142
and you're telling me
you don't think I can win.

34:06.260 --> 34:07.540
I'm not telling you that.

34:07.595 --> 34:09.012
I'm telling you
that I'm petrified.

34:09.096 --> 34:11.731
And I understand, but I
don't have time to comfort you.

34:11.815 --> 34:13.850
- Well, I need you to make time.
- And I can't, because--

34:13.984 --> 34:16.101
Harvey,
this is my life!

34:18.522 --> 34:21.991
When I told Louis how you
got me out of this thing,

34:22.109 --> 34:24.159
he told me how scared he was
at the thought

34:24.277 --> 34:28.864
of me going to prison,
and I just...need...

34:28.998 --> 34:32.118
you...to--

34:32.202 --> 34:35.088
Donna, the thought of you
going to prison

34:35.172 --> 34:37.290
makes me want to drop
to my knees.

34:37.373 --> 34:38.757
You want to hear me say it?

34:38.842 --> 34:40.426
There it is.

34:40.511 --> 34:41.710
But that's not gonna happen,

34:41.795 --> 34:43.212
because I'm not gonna
let it happen.

34:43.297 --> 34:47.266
But in order to do that,
you need to let me do what I do.

34:47.384 --> 34:48.885
- Harvey--
- That's enough.

34:48.969 --> 34:50.353
You want someone
to give you a hug?

34:50.471 --> 34:51.688
Go to Louis.

34:51.804 --> 34:53.473
You want someone to get you out
of this thing,

34:53.556 --> 34:54.806
you need to leave me alone.

35:07.348 --> 35:08.827
I need to know everything
you have,

35:08.828 --> 35:09.792
and I need to know
right now.

35:09.793 --> 35:11.801
We got the conductor to sign on,
but we have to give him--

35:11.802 --> 35:12.802
I don't care what
I have to give him.

35:12.886 --> 35:13.970
What does that give us?

35:14.104 --> 35:15.772
What do you mean?
It gives us standing.

35:15.889 --> 35:17.356
Now we can subpoena
those records.

35:17.474 --> 35:18.608
Well,
that's not enough.

35:18.692 --> 35:20.026
- It's a start.
- I don't need a start.

35:20.144 --> 35:21.504
I need a finish,
and I need it now.

35:24.698 --> 35:26.315
They're charging Donna,
aren't they?

35:26.450 --> 35:28.067
She was arraigned
this morning.

35:28.152 --> 35:31.654
If this thing goes to trial,
I can't guarantee a win.

35:31.789 --> 35:33.372
So we're back to trading
the case for Donna.

35:33.490 --> 35:34.957
Yeah, and I don't want to hear
your moral objections

35:35.042 --> 35:36.959
about those people getting away
with murder.

35:37.077 --> 35:37.960
I'm not talking about that,
Harvey,

35:38.078 --> 35:39.158
but if Donna was arraigned,

35:39.213 --> 35:40.773
it's not up to them
to drop the charges.

35:40.881 --> 35:42.832
It's up to Wolf, and you know
he's never gonna do that.

35:42.916 --> 35:44.596
I'm not talking about
dropping the charges.

35:44.668 --> 35:46.828
I'm talking about making
this whole damn thing go away.

35:46.837 --> 35:48.877
Harvey, if you're saying
what I think you're saying,

35:48.972 --> 35:50.339
that's obstruction of justice.

35:50.424 --> 35:51.841
The way I see it,
it's justice.

35:51.975 --> 35:52.842
You know what I mean.

35:52.926 --> 35:54.086
I do,
and I don't give a shit.

35:54.144 --> 35:56.012
- This is Donna.
- All right, I get it.

35:56.146 --> 35:57.730
But what if what I have
isn't enough?

35:57.848 --> 35:58.931
Like you said,
it's a start.

35:59.016 --> 36:01.517
Have an official complaint
on my desk by the morning.

36:01.685 --> 36:03.845
- And what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna get us enough.

36:15.499 --> 36:17.700
All right, I hear you.
I hear you.

36:20.871 --> 36:22.038
Do you know who I am?

36:22.206 --> 36:23.039
No.

36:23.173 --> 36:25.341
Yeah,
Mike Ross works for me.

36:25.425 --> 36:26.709
Hey,
I don't give a shit.

36:26.844 --> 36:28.761
I told him not to take your case
in the first place,

36:28.879 --> 36:31.347
because I knew you were
a goddamn shakedown artist,

36:31.431 --> 36:33.111
but now someone I care about
is in trouble,

36:33.183 --> 36:34.383
because you took a payout.

36:34.468 --> 36:35.718
Get out of my face.

36:35.886 --> 36:36.936
Listen to me.

36:37.053 --> 36:40.305
If you don't do
what we need you to do,

36:40.390 --> 36:41.390
I will hurt you.

36:41.391 --> 36:42.859
You better be prepared
to kill me,

36:42.943 --> 36:44.810
because I'm not gonna give
that money back.

36:46.563 --> 36:47.883
Well, if this is just
about money,

36:47.898 --> 36:51.400
then we don't need to fight
at all.

36:53.403 --> 36:55.655
Harvey,
this is becoming a habit.

36:55.739 --> 36:57.659
I've seen you more than
my last three boyfriends.

36:57.708 --> 36:59.575
Somehow that doesn't
surprise me.

36:59.660 --> 37:01.294
You're funny.

37:01.411 --> 37:02.795
I like you.

37:02.913 --> 37:05.331
But I know you're not here
to mock my relationship,

37:05.414 --> 37:06.631
so what's on your mind?

37:06.750 --> 37:07.830
We wanted to give you this.

37:07.918 --> 37:09.468
What's this?

37:09.586 --> 37:12.066
It's the lawsuit we filed
on behalf of Michael Jaworski.

37:12.089 --> 37:14.757
You know, the man you let
take the fall for the accident.

37:14.841 --> 37:15.961
Michael Jaworski can't sue--

37:16.009 --> 37:17.476
What?

37:17.594 --> 37:18.477
Sue you,
because you were smart enough

37:18.595 --> 37:20.263
to take care of his expenses?

37:20.430 --> 37:22.348
Well, now I'm taking care
of his expenses.

37:22.432 --> 37:23.599
And now we have standing,

37:23.684 --> 37:25.768
and we are going to subpoena
those documents.

37:25.903 --> 37:28.321
Am I supposed to start quaking
in my boots?

37:28.438 --> 37:30.856
Nope, we know
if you can doctor a report,

37:30.941 --> 37:32.525
you can alter
those maintenance records.

37:32.609 --> 37:33.659
I didn't alter anything.

37:33.777 --> 37:35.494
Well, that's not what
Joe Henderson said.

37:35.612 --> 37:37.530
He said you came to him,
admitted everything,

37:37.613 --> 37:39.581
and offered him a settlement
to keep quiet.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.451
We didn't admit anything,
and that settlement is sealed.

37:42.536 --> 37:45.004
Oh,
you mean this settlement?

37:46.957 --> 37:48.507
We had an agreement.

37:48.625 --> 37:51.065
Well, here's the thing
about paying people off, Evan.

37:51.128 --> 37:53.095
Someone can always
pay them more.

37:54.798 --> 37:57.433
His word won't hold up
against Richard McIntyre's.

37:57.517 --> 38:00.303
Oh, he's not saying that Richard
McIntyre put him up to it.

38:00.387 --> 38:01.387
He's saying you did.

38:01.438 --> 38:02.772
That's bullshit.

38:02.856 --> 38:04.357
And does that really matter?

38:06.810 --> 38:07.810
What do you want?

38:07.861 --> 38:09.862
You made the author
of that report disappear.

38:09.980 --> 38:12.481
You made Joe Henderson
disappear.

38:12.616 --> 38:14.700
Figure out a way to make
the witness against Donna

38:14.818 --> 38:15.818
change her tune.

38:15.986 --> 38:17.703
That's obstruction
of justice.

38:17.821 --> 38:18.988
That's not my problem.

38:19.121 --> 38:21.039
You son of a bitch.

38:21.158 --> 38:22.458
It's your call.

38:22.542 --> 38:25.544
Maybe people will believe Joe,
maybe they won't,

38:25.662 --> 38:26.796
but instead of making money,

38:26.880 --> 38:28.748
you're gonna be
defending yourself in court

38:28.832 --> 38:30.967
for the next five years.

38:31.084 --> 38:33.836
You're so sure we did this,
you're really gonna let us

38:33.971 --> 38:36.055
get away with murder
for your secretary?

38:36.173 --> 38:38.573
You're damn right I am,
and if I had to do it again,

38:38.675 --> 38:41.560
I'd do it 100 times.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.573
What's that?

38:55.826 --> 38:56.826
You know what it is.

39:01.081 --> 39:04.450
- Jeff--
- Jessica, you were right.

39:04.534 --> 39:07.086
We either need to have both,
or it's not going to work.

39:08.538 --> 39:10.873
And you don't want both?

39:10.957 --> 39:15.378
Effective immediately,
I'm tendering my resignation.

39:18.799 --> 39:20.049
Then I wish you luck.

39:21.718 --> 39:24.603
Good luck,
Jessica.

39:46.827 --> 39:47.947
Do you remember?

39:48.078 --> 39:50.996
Yes, of course I remember.
It happened right there.

39:53.800 --> 39:54.800
Well,
it was your fault,

39:54.885 --> 39:56.669
'cause you made me
burst out laughing.

39:56.803 --> 39:57.920
You didn't just burst.

39:58.055 --> 39:59.922
You spat a piece of shrimp
across the room

40:00.057 --> 40:01.537
and into the back
of my mother's hair.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.895
And she didn't even feel it
because of all the hair spray,

40:05.979 --> 40:07.680
and it stuck in there
like a tick.

40:07.814 --> 40:08.898
Oh, my God.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.599
I could hardly look at her
or that boyfriend

40:10.734 --> 40:11.734
for the next two hours.

40:11.768 --> 40:12.768
What was his name again?

40:12.769 --> 40:14.437
Who cares?
He was such a loser.

40:14.571 --> 40:15.905
Oh, come on;
he was the reason you had

40:15.989 --> 40:17.440
that god-awful party
in the first place.

40:26.199 --> 40:27.416
Thank you, Harvey.

40:27.501 --> 40:29.618
You don't need to thank me.
You already thanked me.

40:29.786 --> 40:32.338
No, I thanked you
for fixing it.

40:32.456 --> 40:36.375
Now I'm thanking you for not
bringing it up all night.

40:36.460 --> 40:38.043
I just figured if you wanted
it brought up,

40:38.128 --> 40:41.881
you'd bring it up,
and now you have, so...

40:45.802 --> 40:49.105
I told you I'd never let
anything happen to you,

40:49.189 --> 40:52.725
and I wont ever,

40:52.809 --> 40:57.313
so you don't ever have to
feel scared like that again.

41:00.617 --> 41:03.819
I thought you said you didn't do
the comfort thing.

41:03.904 --> 41:05.371
I didn't say I didn't do it.

41:05.489 --> 41:06.989
I said I didn't have time,

41:07.124 --> 41:11.043
because I was so busy
saving your ass.

41:15.415 --> 41:17.883
I'm sorry I doubted you.

41:21.171 --> 41:23.005
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

41:29.763 --> 41:32.481
Anyone else every loses faith
in me,

41:32.566 --> 41:37.603
it doesn't matter.

41:37.687 --> 41:40.356
But with you,
it's different.

41:48.532 --> 41:50.866
I should go.

41:58.542 --> 42:00.009
Why?

42:00.126 --> 42:02.595
You know why.

42:07.851 --> 42:10.386
You know I love you,
Donna.
