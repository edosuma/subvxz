00:00.834 --> 00:02.602
Previously on medium...

00:02.636 --> 00:04.381
Scanlon: Was standing,
attempting to get out of the tub

00:04.405 --> 00:06.307
when her attacker came
to this doorway.

00:06.340 --> 00:06.807
(Gunshot)

00:06.840 --> 00:07.775
Sorry, guys,

00:07.808 --> 00:09.386
but I seriously doubt
this was a robbery.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.511
Why do you say that?

00:10.544 --> 00:12.213
That's an Armand vartanian,

00:12.246 --> 00:15.549
probably worth three quarters
of a million dollars.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.718
Scanlon: The dead woman,
the driver of the minivan,

00:17.751 --> 00:18.652
name is Olga bankova.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.688
The child in the backseat
was her son Ian.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.190
Seven years old.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.333
Devalos: So... we're certain

00:23.357 --> 00:25.426
the car was pushed
into that lake bed?

00:25.459 --> 00:26.827
Mom!

00:26.860 --> 00:28.262
Help!

00:28.296 --> 00:29.797
(Strangling gasp)

00:29.830 --> 00:31.765
Have you ever considered
running for office?

00:31.799 --> 00:34.168
Excuse me?

00:34.202 --> 00:37.505
We would like to see you go
after a spot on city council.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.772
Hello, detective.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.374
Your deputy-ship.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.375
Haven't seen you
in a couple of days.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.477
No reason for you not
to come over tonight.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.179
Well, then maybe I will.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.590
Man (at restaurant):
You got a boyfriend?

00:46.614 --> 00:47.581
Hopefully, a doctor or a lawyer.

00:47.615 --> 00:48.782
Someone with some standing.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.284
Man: Whomever it might be,

00:50.318 --> 00:52.286
just don't let it be
a civil servant.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.122
Geez, Manny, are you all right?

00:54.155 --> 00:56.424
(Sighs) (Whispers):
You wet the bed.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.791
I called Dr. Berman.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.327
He remembered you.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.162
I made an appointment for 10:30.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.396
I'll drive you.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.831
I'm a grown man.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.834
I can make my own
doctor's appointments,

01:06.867 --> 01:07.635
thank you very much.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.303
Of course.
I know it's dinnertime.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.614
He just wanted
to run some tests,

01:10.638 --> 01:13.241
and I'm just sitting here
waiting for the results.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.443
I've been guarding
it with my life.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.278
I appreciate it.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.679
Oh, my god.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.581
Clay.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.691
What'd you say
your last name was?

01:21.715 --> 01:22.816
Dubois.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.252
Roland.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.686
Allison Roland.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.655
Al.

01:27.688 --> 01:28.832
Why don't you come in the house?

01:28.856 --> 01:30.358
We'll have a cup
of coffee, and...

01:35.429 --> 01:37.798
Allison: I don't think
he knows he's dead.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.568
What? You trying to get me
to feel sorry for him?

01:40.601 --> 01:41.569
I think maybe

01:41.602 --> 01:42.736
that's why he's here.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.805
Maybe that's why
he's waiting for me.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.640
You know what else I heard?

01:46.674 --> 01:48.242
What's that?

01:48.276 --> 01:49.843
That if I try hard enough,

01:49.877 --> 01:53.247
sometimes, someone like me

01:53.281 --> 01:56.450
can be felt...

01:56.484 --> 01:58.486
By someone like you.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.921
(Singsong): Someone is jealous.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.357
Of your high school boyfriend?
I think not.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.658
Clay: You want me to go?

02:04.692 --> 02:06.860
Just say, "Clay,
I need you to go."

02:06.894 --> 02:08.596
Clay, I need you to go!

02:08.628 --> 02:09.896
Did you say "Clay"?

02:09.930 --> 02:12.566
Is he here?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.235
Hey, Allison!

02:15.836 --> 02:17.305
(Screaming)

02:17.338 --> 02:19.173
(Screaming): Mommy!

02:25.546 --> 02:27.581
Is he in here?
I don't see him, no.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.949
Then where is he, Allison?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.818
I don't know.
I don't see him, either.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.253
You expect me to believe that?

02:32.286 --> 02:34.255
Bridgette (screaming): Mommy!

02:34.288 --> 02:36.290
(Phone ringing)

02:40.994 --> 02:43.331
Hello?

02:43.364 --> 02:44.408
Hey, you still coming over?

02:44.432 --> 02:45.466
How'd the drink thing go?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.668
They just left. It went great.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.770
It went really great.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.606
But I need to talk
to you about something.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.442
Anything. What's going on?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.976
(Phone beeping)

02:56.009 --> 02:57.969
Hang on a second, honey,
I'm getting another call.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.985
Baby, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to hold.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.854
I just got a call.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.456
Somebody hit a mansion
in bear park.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.857
I don't have all
the details yet,

03:09.890 --> 03:12.960
but, uh, looks like I'm gonna
have to run out there.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.663
(Phone ringing)

03:17.030 --> 03:18.966
Hello?

03:20.568 --> 03:22.002
Oh, yes, I understand.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.971
He's right here.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.708
Manuel?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.943
What are you doing?

03:29.977 --> 03:32.946
There's been another one
of those house things.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.915
Okay, I know.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.951
The light is on, right?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.487
You turned on the lamp?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.389
The lamp is on?
What are you talking about?

03:41.422 --> 03:42.932
Yes, the light is on.
They're on the phone.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.493
Shh, don't panic. Just tell them
I'll call them back.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.961
What are you talking about
you'll "call them back"?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.297
Lilly...

03:49.330 --> 03:50.964
Listen to me.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.834
Don't be alarmed...

03:53.867 --> 03:55.636
But I can't see a damn thing.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.607
(Crying) Shh, bridgette.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.510
(Phone ringing) Sweetie,
it was just a bad dream.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.978
Sweetie, stop. You're
gonna make yourself sick.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.414
(Crying continues)

04:06.447 --> 04:08.982
It's scanlon.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.050
Hello? Come here.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.019
Scanlon (on phone):
Allison, it happened again.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.423
They got the man of the house.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.724
He has a golf club.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.591
The mom...

04:18.625 --> 04:19.760
In the hall, yeah.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.062
What about the baby?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.064
Did they get the baby?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.767
Yeah, they got the baby, too.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.769
How'd you know?

04:28.802 --> 04:29.937
My daughter told me.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.744
and brought to you by Toyota.
Moving forward.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.715
Choose any direction as
long as it's moving forward.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.728
(Joe sighs)

05:27.761 --> 05:29.062
Go to sleep, Joe.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.365
I can't go to sleep.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.035
He's not here.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.371
You don't know that.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.841
I don't see him.
I don't see him anywhere.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.109
I would tell you if I did.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.077
But you're not even looking.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.079
(Groans)

05:46.113 --> 05:48.582
I don't see him.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.818
I swear. Right.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.053
Uh-huh. What, you
don't believe me?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.589
Allison, the man has
apparently been here

05:55.623 --> 05:56.990
for two whole days.

05:57.024 --> 05:57.958
Now, either you forgot

05:57.991 --> 06:00.127
to mention it or he
can choose when it is

06:00.160 --> 06:02.138
that you see him, and neither
of those two scenarios

06:02.162 --> 06:04.498
makes me particularly
comfortable.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.400
You know, you can
really be an ass.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.535
I didn't do this, Allison.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.012
I'm going to go sleep
in the girls' room.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.639
Go. Holler if you see a ghost.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.407
Yeah, if you see a ghost,
remember:

06:13.441 --> 06:15.375
You're a married woman.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.848
Hey, "allibaster."

06:20.881 --> 06:22.816
Your guy's got quite
the temper, huh?

06:22.850 --> 06:24.151
You think he has a temper?

06:24.184 --> 06:25.986
Shh, down, girl.

06:26.019 --> 06:29.156
How dare you...
Camp out in my house?!

06:29.189 --> 06:31.158
Toy with my family, toy with me,

06:31.191 --> 06:33.160
someone you claim to care about?

06:33.193 --> 06:34.161
I hate you.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.196
No, you don't. Yes,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.832
I do and I need you
to leave my house.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.068
Funny how things work out.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.879
You know, when we were in
school, I thought you were

06:42.903 --> 06:44.204
the smartest thing on two legs.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.907
When we were in school,
I thought you were smug.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.143
And vain and selfish
and nice to look at

06:50.177 --> 06:51.712
and maybe, deep down,
had a heart.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.213
I guess I was wrong
about the heart.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.116
You know, he's mistaken
about you in there.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.150
Pissed off becomes you.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.786
Leave my house!

06:58.819 --> 07:00.821
Don't you think I
would, if I could?

07:00.854 --> 07:03.791
Well, maybe you just
have to try harder.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.226
Come on, you can do it.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.462
Find a light and walk into it.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.239
You think it's just
a coincidence I ended up here,

07:10.263 --> 07:11.799
out of all the places
in all the world?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.233
Your house?

07:13.266 --> 07:17.137
You think it's an
accident you can see me?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.473
Hear me? I don't.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.075
I've been to a lot of places,
I've seen a lot of things.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.211
I don't believe in coincidence.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.946
I'm here for a reason.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.616
And like it or not, baby,

07:28.649 --> 07:30.651
I think that reason is you.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.119
(Door opening)

07:32.152 --> 07:34.755
Mommy, I got scared and I
thought I heard voices.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.992
It's just me, sweetie,
talking to myself.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.861
Did you have a bad dream?

07:40.894 --> 07:44.197
Uh... kind of.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.200
Do you want to come in my
bed and sleep with me?

07:47.234 --> 07:48.936
That might make it all better.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.973
If you don't mind.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.207
Okay, just this once.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.276
As long as we don't
make a habit out of it.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.178
(Chuckles): Okay.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.084
(Beeping) Man: Mr. Devalos.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.687
I'm going to shine a very bright
light into your eyes.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.964
I need you to tell me
if you see something.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.957
Anything.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.525
Devalos: Uh, yeah.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.294
It's very blurry, but I can see.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.197
I see you and I see the room.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.966
And I can see you, Lilly.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.035
My best guess is that we're
looking at a severe case

08:22.069 --> 08:23.971
of diabetic retinopathy.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.539
Blood sugar's off the charts.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.274
You're lucky you can see at all.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.076
You're lucky you're conscious.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.310
Devalos: What does this mean?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.011
Is this thing curable?

08:32.044 --> 08:33.313
It means we wait.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.649
Wait for that Insulin
we're putting in you

08:35.683 --> 08:37.284
to hopefully start
doing its work.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.152
And wait for the
doctors who really

08:39.186 --> 08:40.296
know their way around this stuff

08:40.320 --> 08:42.756
to get here, which
may be a little bit.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.224
It is 4:00 in the
morning, you know.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.893
Lilly: But he's gonna be okay?

08:45.926 --> 08:48.061
We just have to hope the
damage isn't too great.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.064
Mr. Devalos...

08:51.098 --> 08:54.134
When was the last
time you saw a doctor?

08:54.167 --> 08:57.905
Devalos (sighing):
I honestly don't know.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.073
I really can't remember.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.311
I'm gonna shut this light off.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.314
I suggest you get some rest.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.756
Mm-mm-mm.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.758
(Chittering)

09:17.791 --> 09:19.326
(Knocking)

09:19.359 --> 09:21.194
(Gasps) Yoo-hoo.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.797
(Evil laughter)

09:29.903 --> 09:31.805
(Bell clanging)

09:31.839 --> 09:34.107
(Chittering wildly)

09:34.141 --> 09:35.809
(Growling)

09:40.814 --> 09:42.750
(Laughing)

09:44.985 --> 09:46.720
(Loud crashing, mother screams)

10:03.370 --> 10:06.073
(Both gasping)

10:06.106 --> 10:08.375
Okay. Mommy.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.810
I know.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.378
I saw it, too.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.046
It's okay, honey.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.323
It's okay,
it was just a cartoon.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.183
Okay? Shh.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.954
(Steady beeping)

10:20.988 --> 10:22.322
Devalos: Hey.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.194
I can see you.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.429
Hey.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.298
I can see you, too.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.967
You look kind of soft and gauzy,

10:34.001 --> 10:36.937
kind of like an angel.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.907
Kind of like...

10:39.940 --> 10:41.441
We might be in heaven.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.043
We're not dead, are we?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.311
God, I hope not.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.815
I have a bunch of stuff I have
to pick up at the dry cleaners.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.083
If I'm dead,
Joe will never remember

10:50.117 --> 10:51.685
where I keep the tickets.

10:51.719 --> 10:55.188
What did you do?

10:55.222 --> 10:58.258
The dentist, the doctor, flying.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.062
Those are my three big demons.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.732
When I was a teenager,

11:04.765 --> 11:07.434
my... my mother

11:07.467 --> 11:10.370
worked in a department store
refolding merchandise

11:10.403 --> 11:12.706
at night after
everyone had gone home.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.177
She didn't even feel bad.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.279
Just a little pain
under her arm.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.084
Ignored it for the longest time.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.053
Store insisted she see someone.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.021
And then, six weeks later...

11:31.024 --> 11:34.494
I do believe that's
the last time I ever cried.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.363
Got a life's worth of tears out.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.335
You come all this way

11:42.369 --> 11:45.005
just to give me that
swell-looking balloon?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.442
Olga bankova and her son
were run off the road

11:49.476 --> 11:53.146
by the same people who killed
the costigan family last week,

11:53.180 --> 11:55.783
slaughtered the Milano family
last night.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.151
And you know this how?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.387
I know.

12:02.322 --> 12:06.159
We're still in the land
of cartoon people, right?

12:06.193 --> 12:09.129
I'd really like to see
where they lived,

12:09.162 --> 12:10.497
this boy and his mother.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.866
We've already had
a detective out there,

12:12.900 --> 12:14.835
but, sure, you're welcome
to take a look.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.071
Hey, hold on a second.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.207
Uh, thought you were a friend.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.876
Gaze into your crystal ball.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.212
Give a sick man some hope.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.383
It just doesn't work that way.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.786
A lot of times,

12:32.820 --> 12:35.088
the people closest to me...

12:35.122 --> 12:38.859
I didn't even know you were ill.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.961
I do know
that your wife loves you.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.463
We passed in the hall.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.199
She was going home to clean up,

12:46.233 --> 12:48.001
call relatives.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.804
It just poured off her.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.539
"I love this man.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.475
"I'm so angry at this man.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.844
"I love this man.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.813
I am so angry at this man."

13:08.521 --> 13:10.457
Allison: Thank you.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.002
They smashed their way
through this door.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.504
Who, the cartoon bad guys?

13:24.537 --> 13:26.206
It's an old, rotted doorjamb,

13:26.239 --> 13:28.441
an old, rotted door.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.911
If she didn't have it locked,
didn't have the chain on it,

13:30.944 --> 13:31.945
you could kick this open,

13:31.979 --> 13:33.914
we'd never even know.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.323
What is it we're
looking for again?

13:43.356 --> 13:47.027
I don't know, a reason why
killers who hit wealthy families

13:47.060 --> 13:48.929
for no reason at all
would also kill

13:48.962 --> 13:51.098
a substitute teacher
and her child.

13:54.902 --> 13:57.837
Scanlon: Methinks
the woman liked to paint.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.450
Look at this.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.519
It looks like she's trying
to learn how to paint

14:12.552 --> 14:14.054
in the style of this artist.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.062
Do these look familiar?

14:22.095 --> 14:24.531
Sure. I'd recognize
that squiggle anywhere.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.099
It's after 5:00, Allison.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.468
We've got at least a
two-hour drive back.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.303
Allison?

14:32.372 --> 14:36.043
The food court at the mall?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.345
You can have dinner
anywhere you want,

14:38.378 --> 14:41.114
and you want to have it
at the food court at the mall?

14:41.148 --> 14:43.650
Daddy, if you don't really
want to know, you shouldn't ask.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.652
What's wrong with the
food court at the mall?

14:45.685 --> 14:46.586
They have everything.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.089
They have food from
all over the world.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.992
Okay, the people have spoken.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.626
Let me just get
out of these clothes,

14:53.660 --> 14:55.462
and we'll head out to the mall.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.530
Yippee.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.671
(Sighs)

15:15.248 --> 15:16.249
Hello?

15:25.692 --> 15:27.627
She is my wife, you know.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.465
Mine.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.203
I know what you're thinking.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.671
You're thinking,
what am I gonna do, kill you?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.643
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.278
But I will figure something out.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.149
I am gonna make your death

15:49.182 --> 15:52.085
more miserable than your life.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.462
She's mine.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.431
(Blinds rattling)

16:07.667 --> 16:10.670
Hey, Ariel?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.639
Ariel, sweetie,
come here for a second.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.046
Hey, come here.
What are you doing?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.213
I thought you were changing.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.715
I thought we were going
to the mall. We are, we are.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.184
Just have a look
around the room.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.285
Okay.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.354
What am I looking for?

16:27.387 --> 16:28.755
I don't know. What do you see?

16:28.788 --> 16:31.491
Do you see anything?

16:31.524 --> 16:32.759
What are you talking about?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.494
I see what you see.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.362
It's your room.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.065
It looks like your
room always looks.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.266
Are you okay?

16:39.299 --> 16:40.600
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just curious.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.302
So...

16:42.335 --> 16:45.672
There's nothing you see in here
that's out of the ordinary?

16:45.705 --> 16:46.673
I don't know.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.709
Did mommy get a new
bedspread or something?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.313
Huh.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.314
(Blinds rattling)

16:54.347 --> 16:56.449
(Joe imitating wind)

16:56.483 --> 16:57.650
It's the wind, daddy.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.090
It's just the wind.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.326
Huh.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.627
I'm really hungry.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.262
We're all really hungry.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.262
Yes, me, too.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.631
Come on.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.666
I'll change later.
Let's get out of here.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.436
Let's go.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.039
You know, they have food from
all over the world there.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.666
Look at this. Together again.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.807
If we're here,
who's running the city?

17:57.177 --> 17:59.412
Could you have picked
a more out of the way place?

17:59.446 --> 18:01.814
Yeah, pretty obscure, huh?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.716
May I start you off
with something to drink?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.352
You on the clock?

18:05.385 --> 18:06.753
I'll have a scotch and soda.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.657
The lady will have
a dirty Martini.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.126
So, when last we spoke, uh...

18:13.160 --> 18:14.427
Dinovi: When last we spoke...

18:14.461 --> 18:15.362
(Sighs)

18:15.395 --> 18:17.197
Where do I start?

18:17.230 --> 18:19.732
Drinks... lady from
the third district...

18:19.766 --> 18:21.334
It went great.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.436
It's been 24 hours, and
I still don't believe it.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.470
Believe what?

18:26.506 --> 18:28.641
They want me to run
for city council.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.711
Wow.

18:31.744 --> 18:32.921
(Exhales)
I should cancel the cocktails

18:32.945 --> 18:34.547
and get us
a bottle of champagne.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.791
Don't do that.
I've been dreaming

18:35.815 --> 18:36.716
about a Martini all day.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.185
A Martini? Not me?

18:38.218 --> 18:39.519
A Martini and you.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.188
I was just

18:41.221 --> 18:43.723
so completely taken by surprise.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.534
Then they started hitting
me with these questions.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.727
Questions?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.629
"Where were you born?
Are you a native?

18:49.662 --> 18:50.706
"Do you belong to any clubs?

18:50.730 --> 18:51.740
Are you involved with anyone?"

18:51.764 --> 18:53.200
You fess up?

18:53.233 --> 18:55.235
I told them the truth.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.170
That, for all intents
and purposes, I'm...

18:57.204 --> 18:58.747
You're at my house
one or two nights a week.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.707
Well, no, I didn't
tell them that.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.185
I don't think a woman
running for office

19:02.209 --> 19:03.786
should be bragging about
making the walk of shame

19:03.810 --> 19:06.213
from her lover's apartment to
her car at 6:30 in the morning,

19:06.246 --> 19:08.881
praying that nobody sees her.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.617
Yeah, well...

19:12.352 --> 19:15.422
I want to talk to you
about that.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.224
No, it's okay.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.591
I realized something.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.693
I like what we have,
the way we have it.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.764
I wasn't sure at first.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.400
Never been with someone who
didn't want to come home with me

19:27.434 --> 19:29.202
to my folks at Christmas, but...

19:29.236 --> 19:30.203
But it's okay.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.238
It's actually good.

19:31.271 --> 19:34.474
One of the things these
people said to me was,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.243
I guess a lot of the
union agreements...

19:36.276 --> 19:40.247
Police, fire, teachers...
They're all coming up next year.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.451
I mean, the last thing they
wanted to hear was that I'm...

19:44.484 --> 19:48.655
Whatever you call this thing we
have... with a civil servant.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.262
Is that what I am,
a civil servant?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.829
What? No.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.431
That's their word.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.466
It's really just about...

19:59.499 --> 20:01.801
I get the point.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.570
They don't want you
sleeping with the help.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.505
It's really just about
these negotiations.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.539
What did you say?

20:06.573 --> 20:08.408
(Cell phone ringing)
There was nothing to say.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.481
Uh-huh.

20:14.514 --> 20:15.548
Got it.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.750
I'll see you there.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.752
Wait a second.

20:19.786 --> 20:20.863
I thought we were having dinner.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.722
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.391
I'm just a civil servant.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.459
I get a call, I go to work.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.361
Lee... what?

20:28.395 --> 20:31.898
Hey, some people just got shot
to death in hasbrook heights.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.533
The mayor's back in town,

20:33.566 --> 20:34.934
so you're not getting the call,

20:34.967 --> 20:36.603
but I'm just a working guy.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.605
Enjoy your drink; It's paid for.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.740
Are you hurt?

20:40.773 --> 20:43.776
You don't even let me keep
a toothbrush at your place

20:43.810 --> 20:45.778
and you're hurt?!

20:45.812 --> 20:47.280
I'm not hurt.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.281
I'm thrilled for you.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.383
You have my vote.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.719
But I got to go.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.958
Will the gentleman be returning?

21:03.630 --> 21:05.965
(Gasps)

21:05.998 --> 21:08.034
It's scanlon.
He says it's important.

21:08.067 --> 21:11.604
You didn't have another
bad dream, did you?

21:14.541 --> 21:15.875
Hello?

21:15.908 --> 21:18.745
Scanlon: You want the good news,
the bad news or the very bad news?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.713
Just tell me what's going on.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.015
(Over phone):
Another home invasion.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.818
Only this time, the homeowner
was packing heat.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.754
Killed all three of them.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.831
I think it's over, Allison.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.757
I think it's all over.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.058
Okay.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.694
What about the very bad news?

21:34.727 --> 21:36.429
Your boss is still
in the hospital.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.106
I need you to get dressed
and come downtown

21:38.130 --> 21:39.866
and help me interrogate
the solid citizen

21:39.899 --> 21:41.401
who gunned down
these three bastards.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.735
What is it, mommy?

21:42.769 --> 21:44.003
Who's on the phone?

21:44.036 --> 21:45.538
Hold on.

21:45.572 --> 21:46.539
It's the police, honey.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.107
They got the bad monkeyheads.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.743
They're not gonna bother
anybody anymore.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.780
Scanlon: Spell your
name for me, please.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.114
Alan gardner.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.817
G-a-r-d-n-e-r.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.118
And I should warn you,

21:59.151 --> 22:01.020
I don't think
I'm actually sick, but I...

22:01.053 --> 22:02.555
We know.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.657
We know that you've been through
a lot tonight.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.926
The officer mentioned
that you've been throwing up.

22:06.959 --> 22:10.563
I think it's just nerves.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.437
I'm actually feeling
a little better right now.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.035
You want to tell
us what happened?

22:16.068 --> 22:18.571
What happened...

22:18.605 --> 22:20.940
I don't know... I mean, I guess,

22:20.973 --> 22:24.076
like everybody with a big
house, I've been on edge.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.379
It was the staff's night off.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.414
I had been reading.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.882
Fell asleep in bed.

22:29.916 --> 22:30.983
Then the alarm went off.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.919
What did you do?

22:32.952 --> 22:34.821
I ran into the closet.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.757
It's like a little
vault, actually...

22:37.790 --> 22:39.959
Fireproof.

22:39.992 --> 22:43.563
I keep some papers there,
antiquities, canvases.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.097
I'm an art dealer.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.800
And I thought, well, I'll just
lock the door and stay in here.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.602
I don't think they can
shoot through it.

22:49.636 --> 22:50.937
Like a panic room.

22:50.970 --> 22:51.938
Yeah.

22:51.971 --> 22:52.939
But small.

22:52.972 --> 22:53.873
And there's monitors in there.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.108
So I can see them moving
through the house.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.010
And I know the police
are trying to call.

22:58.044 --> 23:01.481
And I thought for a moment,

23:01.514 --> 23:04.050
I think I might actually
live through this thing.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.956
Then they shot keezey.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.963
That little schnauzer
is the only family I have.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.669
I mean, you go through
the housebreaking,

23:22.702 --> 23:26.739
the bladder infections,
the doggie tumors,

23:26.773 --> 23:28.708
and you just never imagine...

23:31.744 --> 23:33.055
Even on the
black-and-white monitor,

23:33.079 --> 23:35.214
I can see him lying there,

23:35.247 --> 23:36.816
the blood coming
out of his body.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.990
That's when I saw the gun...

23:44.023 --> 23:47.594
The rifle, box of ammo...

23:47.627 --> 23:49.161
I got it, like, six years ago,

23:49.195 --> 23:51.931
to go skeet shooting with
a client, which I hated.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.767
So much noise, and it...

23:54.801 --> 23:56.736
Hurt my shoulder.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.909
Then I went out into the hall.

24:05.011 --> 24:07.614
The way the stairs work,
you can't see into the hall

24:07.647 --> 24:09.916
unless you're at the top.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.220
And I just waited.

24:14.253 --> 24:16.589
(Gunshots)

24:27.199 --> 24:28.167
(Gently): Mr. Gardner?

24:28.200 --> 24:31.938
I am a civilized person.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.673
I know they were killers.

24:33.706 --> 24:34.807
They killed my keezey.

24:34.841 --> 24:38.878
But I just never imagined,
in the course of my life,

24:38.911 --> 24:41.948
that I would actually
kill another man.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.485
Three other men.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.890
I think I'm gonna be sick.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.239
Look who's returning
to the marital bed.

25:09.308 --> 25:12.945
What is it, like,
4:00 in the morning?

25:12.979 --> 25:15.047
It's nice of you to
make an appearance.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.583
It's, like, 5:00.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.851
Or five-oh-s...

25:19.986 --> 25:21.187
Seven.

25:30.096 --> 25:32.965
I think it's really over.

25:32.999 --> 25:36.002
The home invaders are dead.

25:36.035 --> 25:39.005
This meek little
art dealer shot them,

25:39.038 --> 25:43.042
'cause they killed his dog.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.112
Bridgette will be relieved.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.281
No more bad dreams.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.251
It's funny the way
stuff happens.

25:55.888 --> 26:00.092
I think your boyfriend's
gone, by the way.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.661
Allison: Oh, yeah?

26:01.694 --> 26:03.362
Joe: We had a chat.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.032
I mean, I had a chat.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.200
And I think he heard it,

26:08.234 --> 26:10.737
because I haven't felt
any cold breezes,

26:10.770 --> 26:13.740
and he hasn't been seen since.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.341
What do you mean?

26:15.374 --> 26:17.109
Seen by who? Who could see him?

26:17.143 --> 26:18.210
He's a ghost.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.780
I had Ariel take a
little look for him.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.249
I mean, she didn't know

26:23.282 --> 26:24.917
that that's who she
was looking for.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.886
You did not. Yes...

26:30.356 --> 26:32.859
I certainly did.

26:32.892 --> 26:36.162
Did you think I was just gonna
give you up without a fight?

26:36.195 --> 26:39.398
(Joe sighs)

26:39.431 --> 26:42.368
I love you with all my heart.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.942
(Sighs)

26:50.710 --> 26:53.345
(Whimsical cartoon music
playing)

26:53.379 --> 26:57.116
(Chittering)

26:57.149 --> 26:59.151
Mm-mm-mm.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.687
(Chittering)

27:00.720 --> 27:02.855
(Pounding)

27:02.889 --> 27:04.623
Yoo-hoo.

27:07.259 --> 27:10.730
(Chattering wildly)

27:10.763 --> 27:12.865
(Growling)

27:17.403 --> 27:19.338
(Laughing)

27:21.841 --> 27:22.809
You got it now?

27:22.842 --> 27:24.977
You got it figured out?
'Cause I got to go.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.846
(Gasps)

27:31.317 --> 27:32.151
(Footsteps approaching)

27:32.184 --> 27:33.720
Scanlon:
Wow, what are you doing here?

27:33.753 --> 27:35.187
Aren't you the lady
who was with me

27:35.221 --> 27:36.889
till almost 4:30 this morning?

27:36.923 --> 27:38.424
Shouldn't you be
at home sleeping?

27:38.457 --> 27:41.427
I tried sleeping.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.262
I kept dreaming.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.297
What about you?
Why aren't you home sleeping?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.398
I don't know.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.200
Phone kept ringing.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.469
You wanted to see me.
Is something up?

27:50.502 --> 27:53.005
It's like I said,
I keep having dreams.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.174
Yeah? So?

27:55.207 --> 27:59.045
Isn't that kind of like Einstein
always having brainstorms?

27:59.078 --> 28:00.079
You recognize this?

28:00.112 --> 28:01.123
Thought you said you would

28:01.147 --> 28:02.190
recognize this
squiggle anywhere.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.884
It's that painting devalos
told us was so valuable,

28:04.917 --> 28:06.318
that was hanging
at the first house.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.420
Okay. Remember

28:08.454 --> 28:11.357
those little paintings at Olga's
house I was looking at...

28:11.390 --> 28:13.492
I told you they reminded me
of something?

28:13.525 --> 28:16.128
This is the painting
they remind me of.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.497
I'm glad we, uh, solved
that mystery. I think she was

28:18.530 --> 28:21.067
trying to learn how to paint
in the style of this painter.

28:21.100 --> 28:25.137
I think she was trying to learn
to paint this painting.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.939
You think they killed her
for that?

28:26.973 --> 28:28.516
How does that explain
the other killings?

28:28.540 --> 28:31.443
How does that explain the home
invasions in two other states?

28:31.477 --> 28:34.180
To be honest, I don't know.
I just...

28:34.213 --> 28:37.083
Both those houses are still
crime scenes, right?

28:37.116 --> 28:39.251
Could someone possibly

28:39.285 --> 28:41.353
just bring me this painting?

28:41.387 --> 28:43.956
Maybe all the little ones
I was looking at

28:43.990 --> 28:45.200
at Olga's house?
Allison, is it possible

28:45.224 --> 28:47.894
that in all the hubbub last
night, that you missed the part

28:47.927 --> 28:49.271
where the home invaders
were shot to death?

28:49.295 --> 28:50.362
No, I heard that.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.464
Did you miss the part
where I said (phone rings)

28:52.498 --> 28:54.500
I was still having
dreams about it all?

28:58.037 --> 28:59.005
So what do you think?

28:59.038 --> 29:03.009
I think someone's in a mood.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.443
Sorry.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.880
A friend of mine who was
visiting left suddenly.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.248
I guess...

29:09.281 --> 29:12.184
I guess I wanted to say good-bye
more than I realized.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.420
Yeah, good-byes are
a bitch, aren't they?

29:14.453 --> 29:15.788
Woman: How's your vision?

29:15.822 --> 29:16.789
It's good.

29:16.823 --> 29:17.556
I can see perfectly.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.657
I feel good, too.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.827
Frankly, doctor, I feel ready
to get out of here.

29:20.860 --> 29:21.828
Ready to get back to work.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.996
Well, that's what's going
to kill you, you know.

29:24.030 --> 29:24.931
How good you feel.

29:24.964 --> 29:28.835
You have diabetes,
Mr. District attorney.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.337
I think that you've probably
had it for years,

29:31.370 --> 29:32.471
but you just didn't know.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.306
It's a sneaky little bastard.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.541
If you're not checking for it,

29:35.574 --> 29:38.410
it doesn't let you know it's
there until it's good and ready

29:38.444 --> 29:40.412
to give you a stroke
or a heart attack,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.148
make you impotent
or strike you blind.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.583
Are you trying to frighten me?

29:44.616 --> 29:46.418
No, I am trying to warn you.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.487
Now, I can see you
every three months.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.421
We can monitor this thing.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.058
I can teach you how to get
on top of it.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.960
Or I can see you
in a couple of years.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.996
Now, if they manage to keep
you alive until you get

29:57.029 --> 29:58.564
to the hospital,
well, then we can

29:58.597 --> 30:01.367
chat about how high on your leg
we need to amputate

30:01.400 --> 30:03.069
or maybe where the best braille

30:03.102 --> 30:05.204
classes are.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.445
(Phone rings)

30:17.449 --> 30:19.018
(Sighs)

30:19.051 --> 30:20.252
Okay, so what does this prove?

30:20.286 --> 30:22.497
You know, I don't know anything
about this stuff, Allison.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.123
Yeah, I know. Me neither.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.225
But I know someone who does.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.027
Hey, I just wanted
to let you know

30:28.060 --> 30:29.028
I'm heading out to carefree.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.897
Paying a visit to Alan gardner.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.900
That gallery owner who shot
those three home invaders.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.101
Are you okay to drive?

30:35.134 --> 30:37.569
What'd you get,
about 15 minutes sleep?

30:37.603 --> 30:39.171
No, I'm fine.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.572
I'm not going to be there long.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.508
I've just have a couple
paintings in the car

30:42.541 --> 30:44.576
I asked him to take a look at.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.346
Hey, can I ask you something?

30:47.379 --> 30:49.115
Hmm? Sure.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.449
What did you say to him?

30:50.482 --> 30:52.084
What are you talking about?

30:52.118 --> 30:54.053
To Clay. Last night.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.523
(Sighs)

30:57.556 --> 30:59.525
You know what?

30:59.558 --> 31:01.460
I'm sorry I mentioned it.
It was silly.

31:01.493 --> 31:04.230
I'm sure that
there was nobody there.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.966
Okay. But what did you say
to him?

31:08.067 --> 31:09.668
Uh...

31:09.701 --> 31:11.170
(Static)

31:11.203 --> 31:14.173
Hello?

31:14.206 --> 31:16.375
Clay: He said, "she's mine."

31:16.408 --> 31:20.346
He said everything
you'd want him to say.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.315
He said everything
you'd hoped he'd say,

31:23.349 --> 31:26.118
if some crazy numbskull
showed up on your doorstep

31:26.152 --> 31:29.088
with the idea that maybe
he could have you back.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.224
(Phone rings)

31:37.029 --> 31:39.031
Sorry. I-I lost you.

31:39.065 --> 31:43.135
Yeah, well, um, I don't know
what to tell you.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.637
I don't know, exactly,

31:45.671 --> 31:48.140
what I said, and I really
don't think it matters.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.376
You're right. It doesn't matter.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.279
I mean, I don't know what I was
getting so worked up about.

31:54.513 --> 31:58.317
After all... I'm here.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.686
Till death do us part.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.121
Yes.

32:02.154 --> 32:05.057
And who knows. Maybe longer.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.659
I'll see you when I get home.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.429
I will see you
when you get home.

32:17.203 --> 32:18.937
He's a good man.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.042
I know.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.477
I was wrong about why I'm here.

32:25.511 --> 32:28.180
And you were right.

32:28.214 --> 32:31.117
And I am smug, vain, selfish...

32:31.150 --> 32:32.985
Even in death.

32:33.019 --> 32:36.422
None of this has anything
to do with me.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.225
I finally figured that out
last night.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.994
I'm not here to woo you.

32:42.028 --> 32:44.430
I'm here to help you.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.665
To tell you something

32:46.698 --> 32:49.168
that you otherwise
wouldn't know.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.703
To redeem myself.

32:53.339 --> 32:58.444
And then, Allison,
I think I'll be on my way.

32:58.477 --> 33:02.114
You sent me that dream
last night, didn't you?

33:02.148 --> 33:03.149
The one with

33:03.182 --> 33:05.317
the cartoon?

33:05.351 --> 33:08.054
I know where you're going.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.521
And I know what you're
about to do.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.257
And I know how it all ends up.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.393
But I need to get you
to do something first.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.472
Ah.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.640
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.608
Mr. District attorney,

33:29.641 --> 33:31.743
I'd like to introduce
you to Alan gardner.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.355
The gentleman who
single-handedly stopped

33:33.379 --> 33:35.514
those three ruthless
home invaders.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.748
This is an honor,

33:36.782 --> 33:38.750
sir. No, it's an honor
meeting you, sir.

33:38.784 --> 33:39.885
Please.

33:39.918 --> 33:43.622
I apologize for not being made
available to you sooner.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.157
I was a bit under the weather.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.268
But I just wanted
to let you know

33:46.292 --> 33:48.527
that this office stands ready
to help you navigate

33:48.560 --> 33:50.705
whatever legal hurdles your
extraordinarily brave actions

33:50.729 --> 33:52.364
may have created for you.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.100
Oh.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.767
Should I have brought

33:55.801 --> 33:56.768
my lawyer?

33:56.802 --> 33:58.704
Both the detective

33:58.737 --> 33:59.781
and Mrs. Dubois,
the other night,

33:59.805 --> 34:01.273
seemed to indicate
that... that...

34:01.307 --> 34:02.617
That shooting
three people to death

34:02.641 --> 34:03.809
to protect one's own life

34:03.842 --> 34:06.345
is a perfectly justifiable
course of action? Absolutely.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.647
So long as you can prove
that you were in mortal

34:08.679 --> 34:11.617
danger, you have nothing to fear
from the justice system.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.719
Well, is there any doubt
about that?

34:14.753 --> 34:16.355
Doubts? No.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.190
No doubts, but questions.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.757
There are always questions.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.627
There's quite a lot

34:21.659 --> 34:23.629
of valuable art in your
home, isn't there, sir?

34:23.661 --> 34:24.830
I own two art galleries.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.797
Of course there's art
in my home.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.135
You may have heard,
in addition to your home,

34:29.168 --> 34:31.870
and the two others in the
Phoenix area, two others

34:31.902 --> 34:34.639
in the southwest were also hit.
Guess what they all had

34:34.672 --> 34:36.475
in common? Every family that was

34:36.507 --> 34:38.610
targeted, owned at least
one major work of art.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.812
But I-I don't understand.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.880
I thought I read that
nothing had been taken from

34:42.914 --> 34:44.616
the homes.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.219
The papers never mentioned
anything about art being stolen.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.155
And it appears that none had,
but then...

34:49.188 --> 34:50.789
Mrs. Dubois here
developed a theory.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.725
Well, what if you could find
someone who could paint

34:53.759 --> 34:56.628
near-perfect copies
of modern masterpieces?

34:56.661 --> 34:58.130
You go into a home.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.499
You massacre everyone
who lives there.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.602
You replace the authentic
painting with the fake.

35:03.635 --> 35:07.873
Then while everyone is consumed
with the grief and horror,

35:07.906 --> 35:10.842
you quietly sell the priceless
originals to wealthy collectors

35:10.876 --> 35:12.278
in the middle east and Asia.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.446
Wow.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.149
You think that's
what's been going on?

35:17.183 --> 35:18.850
Well, that's the reason

35:18.884 --> 35:21.420
I brought that painting to you
yesterday.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.822
It came from the costigan home
after the massacre.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.158
I was really hoping
to get your expert opinion

35:26.192 --> 35:27.759
as to its authenticity.

35:27.793 --> 35:28.994
Well, I'll sign anything.

35:29.027 --> 35:31.497
And happily testify under oath,
the painting you showed me,

35:31.530 --> 35:33.499
the one you said came
from the costigan home,

35:33.532 --> 35:36.768
that's absolutely an original
Armand vartanian.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.804
Easily worth at least
a million dollars.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.673
Maybe twice that, depending
on the appetite of the buyer.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.875
So much for your theory.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.612
So you would be willing to sign

35:46.645 --> 35:47.879
a sworn statement

35:47.913 --> 35:50.682
vouching for the painting's
authenticity?

35:50.716 --> 35:52.884
Well, I'd have no choice.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.662
Sorry about that.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.631
Mm. I appreciate this.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.466
(Sighs)

36:07.499 --> 36:10.702
And let me present you
with this.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.438
And this is? That...

36:12.471 --> 36:14.773
That's a search warrant.

36:14.806 --> 36:18.410
Actually, the detectives should
be arriving at your house

36:18.444 --> 36:19.678
right about now.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.480
To look for what?

36:21.513 --> 36:24.516
That painting
that I brought you yesterday...

36:24.550 --> 36:27.219
An old friend suggested,
before I gave it to you,

36:27.253 --> 36:29.321
that I Mark it in some way.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.757
So, on the back,
where it would do no damage,

36:31.790 --> 36:33.459
I wrote the initials, "c.B."

36:33.492 --> 36:35.427
In indelible marker.

36:35.461 --> 36:38.230
That is the painting
that you gave back to me.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.702
And, yes, it's the real
actual painting.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.438
But it's not the painting
I brought to your house.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.747
No initials.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.683
The painting

36:57.716 --> 37:00.852
I brought to your house was the
one you had Olga bankova paint.

37:00.886 --> 37:04.256
What are you suggesting?

37:04.290 --> 37:06.658
What are you...
What are you talking about?

37:06.692 --> 37:07.759
Those home invaders

37:07.793 --> 37:09.895
worked for you, Mr. Gardner.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.263
So did Olga.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.898
Although we're fairly
certain she had

37:12.931 --> 37:15.467
no idea what she vas involved
in until it was too late.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.603
When you realized I was going
to pay you a visit,

37:17.636 --> 37:19.046
you thought I might be
on to something.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.972
So you gave me
the authentic painting

37:21.006 --> 37:22.541
to throw me off the scent.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.376
This is preposterous.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.644
Devalos: Really?

37:25.677 --> 37:28.947
What about the part where you
suggested to your hired killers

37:28.980 --> 37:31.483
that you needed them
to hit one more home... yours.

37:31.517 --> 37:32.984
But, unlike everyone else,

37:33.018 --> 37:35.458
you weren't surprised when they
showed up... you were waiting.

37:38.724 --> 37:39.725
You can't prove that.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.627
Oh, I think we can.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.694
What was your story...

37:42.728 --> 37:44.396
Waiting at the top
of the stairs?

37:44.430 --> 37:46.565
We think maybe you were
hiding at the bottom.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.567
Devalos:
According to ballistics,

37:48.600 --> 37:50.402
you shot those men in the back.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.571
Your dog, too.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.573
Now, if you'll

37:54.606 --> 37:57.075
excuse us, I need to give myself
a little Insulin shot

37:57.108 --> 37:58.610
and I'd love to have
a word with you.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.712
Detective, read this
man his rights.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.815
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.617
Anything you say can and will be

38:05.651 --> 38:07.611
(in distance): Used against
you in a court of law.

38:09.355 --> 38:12.090
Nice work, Allison. I mean that.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.025
I'd like to think
if I'd been feeling better

38:14.059 --> 38:16.462
I might have listened
more and sooner.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.664
Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.832
It wasn't just me;
I had a lot of help.

38:20.866 --> 38:21.876
Yeah, I know, your daughter.

38:21.900 --> 38:22.868
The cartoons.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.836
Yeah, and an old friend.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.639
Well, thank him for me, too.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.676
Yeah, well, if I see him,
I will.

38:33.078 --> 38:36.648
Allison: Some say sleep
is the death of each day's life.

38:36.682 --> 38:40.018
But I say sleep is the gateway
to our dreams.

38:40.051 --> 38:43.755
And our dreams are the map
of our humanity.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.992
Ever watch a child sleep?

38:47.025 --> 38:49.561
They almost always smile.

38:49.595 --> 38:52.598
They know what's coming.

38:52.631 --> 38:53.932
And adults?

38:53.965 --> 38:57.603
Ever notice how we try to tidy
up our lives just before bed?

39:00.038 --> 39:01.673
(Moans)

39:01.707 --> 39:03.609
Did you take your pills?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.711
Mm-hmm.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.679
Check your sugar?

39:13.151 --> 39:16.755
You die on me, I'll
never forgive you.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.757
Don't worry.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.694
I'm not going anywhere.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.535
Or what a disappointment it is

39:29.568 --> 39:31.102
when we're lurched out
of our sleep,

39:31.136 --> 39:34.105
(phone rings) Our dreams,
by something unexpected.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.611
Scanlon.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.680
Hi.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.550
(Sighs) Uh...

39:44.583 --> 39:46.718
Who is it? Is it work?

39:46.752 --> 39:48.620
Uh... want me to go?

39:48.654 --> 39:50.656
No. It's okay.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.057
It's nothing. Wrong number.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.459
Mmm.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.679
Hey, al.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.517
Allibaster.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.552
You know what I heard?

40:20.586 --> 40:23.922
That if I want it bad enough...

40:23.955 --> 40:26.558
If I try hard enough...

40:26.592 --> 40:29.928
Sometimes, someone like me...

40:29.961 --> 40:33.765
Can actually be felt...

40:33.799 --> 40:35.867
By someone like you.

40:35.901 --> 40:39.471
A great man once said,

40:39.505 --> 40:41.807
"if a little dreaming
is dangerous,

40:41.840 --> 40:44.743
"the cure for it
is not to dream less...

40:44.776 --> 40:47.913
But to dream more."

40:51.717 --> 40:54.219
Did you think I was just going
to give up

40:54.252 --> 40:57.155
and let you dream this dream
without a fight?

41:01.527 --> 41:04.129
Dream all the time.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.631
Yeah, I'm for that.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.209
and brought to you by Toyota.
Moving forward.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.669
Choose any direction, as
long as it's moving forward.
