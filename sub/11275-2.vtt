        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:08.900 --> 00:11.600
      I hate this uniform.      

00:12.300 --> 00:13.500
          It is ugly.           

00:13.600 --> 00:17.000
     It makes me look like      
        a beached whale.        

00:17.000 --> 00:18.600
    And on top of everything    

00:18.700 --> 00:21.700
I can't find any earrings       
         to go with it.         

00:21.800 --> 00:23.300
              Try some broccoli.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.100
                Ha-ha-ha!       

00:24.100 --> 00:27.200
            I mean it, Sam.     
            I really hate it.   

00:27.200 --> 00:28.100
I used to like it,              

00:28.100 --> 00:29.700
but now I'm getting             
kind of tired of it.            

00:29.700 --> 00:33.000
Feel like I'm wearing           
the same thing every day.       

00:33.000 --> 00:34.800
Listen, I'm not a big fan       
of them either                  

00:34.800 --> 00:36.700
but let's just                  
give it our best here.          

00:36.700 --> 00:38.100
Come on. Come on.               

00:38.200 --> 00:39.100
Come on, Sam...                 
                No, no, don't...

00:39.100 --> 00:42.800
Can't you just talk             
to the Iron Maiden?             

00:42.800 --> 00:44.500
Convince her                    
to get rid of them.             

00:44.500 --> 00:46.200
    Come on.                    
                Oh...           

00:48.100 --> 00:49.800
Miss Howe, uh...                

00:49.900 --> 00:51.100
about the uniforms.             

00:51.100 --> 00:52.600
                Oh, I'm glad    
                you reminded me.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.500
          The dry cleaning plant
          is on strike.         

00:54.500 --> 00:56.300
            Now, we may not have
            fresh uniforms      

00:56.400 --> 00:57.300
            for at least a week,

00:57.400 --> 00:59.200
    so I want you to be         
    extra careful with those.

                I've seen you

             I can't believe it.

Hey, everybody.                 

03:02.000 --> 03:04.100
             It's Dave Richards,
             Channel 10.

          Channel 13.

                      Oh, sorry.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.800
                     Never mind.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.300
    Sam, I got a proposition    
            for you.            

03:13.300 --> 03:14.200
                No, no, no...   

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
            if she's not good   
            enough for you,     

03:15.200 --> 03:16.000
          I sure don't want her.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.800
No, no, it's nothing like that. 

03:18.800 --> 03:20.000
You see,                        
I have to give up               

03:20.000 --> 03:22.600
    my TV spot, <i>I on Sports.</i>    

03:22.600 --> 03:23.900
They're looking                 
for a fill-in                   

03:23.900 --> 03:26.200
for the week and I thought      
    you might be interested.    

03:26.200 --> 03:28.300
Boy, sports on TV...            

03:28.300 --> 03:30.700
  I've never really considered  
             that.              

03:30.700 --> 03:34.400
      ( <i>with deep voice</i> ):      
  Think I'd be any good at it?  

03:34.400 --> 03:36.300
Who knows? It may turn out      
 to be a permanent gig for you. 

03:36.300 --> 03:37.500
That's how I got my start.      

03:37.600 --> 03:39.700
    Whoo, boy, I don't know.    

03:39.700 --> 03:41.200
            Oh, come on, Sam.   

03:41.200 --> 03:42.300
                        Come on.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.700
    Every time we watch Dave,   

03:43.700 --> 03:46.100
    you say, "I can do better   
    than that stump."           

03:48.900 --> 03:50.600
    Thank you, Carla.           
    You're too kind.            

03:50.700 --> 03:52.000
Come on, Sam.                   

03:52.000 --> 03:52.900
        You'd be great.         

03:53.000 --> 03:54.800
     You talk good like me      
     and you're handsome.       

03:54.800 --> 03:56.700
                 NORM:          
                 Of course, Sam.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.200
                What do you say?
                Listen...       

03:58.200 --> 04:00.400
     if I were you, okay--      
        and believe me,         

04:00.500 --> 04:02.700
    not a day goes by           
     I don't wish I were--      

04:02.700 --> 04:04.100
     I would take this job.     

04:04.100 --> 04:05.400
Sam, look...                    

04:06.600 --> 04:09.100
It's a lot of fun.              

04:09.200 --> 04:11.000
You see, you get                
to sit behind this desk.        

04:11.000 --> 04:12.300
You don't have                  
to wear pants.                  

04:12.900 --> 04:14.800
It's my little joke             
on the audience.                

04:17.700 --> 04:22.300
    I do know sports,           
  and I'm articulate at that.   

04:22.300 --> 04:23.300
    Hey, you know something?    

04:23.400 --> 04:24.500
      I'm going to do it.       

04:24.500 --> 04:26.000
        All right!              

04:26.100 --> 04:26.900
        Congratulations.        

04:26.900 --> 04:27.600
          Thanks, man.          

04:27.700 --> 04:28.500
      You're on at 11:00.       

04:28.600 --> 04:29.600
    Wait a minute. Tonight?     

04:29.700 --> 04:31.600
    Without any preparation     
          or anything?          

04:31.600 --> 04:32.900
  Sure, I do it all the time.   

04:34.400 --> 04:37.000
  Look, I want you to get down  
     to Wardrobe ASAP, huh?     

04:37.100 --> 04:37.700
        All right.              

04:37.700 --> 04:39.100
See ya.                         

04:39.100 --> 04:40.300
  Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, man.  

04:40.300 --> 04:42.600
  Who do I talk to over there?  

04:42.600 --> 04:46.000
  A very good friend of mine,   
Phil somebody or another.       

04:46.100 --> 04:49.000
I forget. Anyway,               
I got to get going,             
meet my lady.                   

04:49.000 --> 04:50.200
She's terrific.                 
                        Huh?    

04:50.200 --> 04:53.600
This time the Dave Machine      
is finally settling down.       

04:53.600 --> 04:54.800
Well, hey,                      
congratulations, man.           

04:54.800 --> 04:58.200
Excuse me.                      
The alarm just went off.        

04:59.500 --> 05:01.200
I make an ungodly               
amount of money                 

05:01.200 --> 05:03.300
and I know exactly              
how to use it.                  

05:06.800 --> 05:08.900
            You must be a friend
            of Mr. Malone's.    

05:10.700 --> 05:11.800
Well, you know                  
what they say,                  

05:11.900 --> 05:13.600
"The good-looking ones          
travel in pairs."               

05:13.600 --> 05:15.100
And, uh,                        

05:15.100 --> 05:16.800
     that's certainly true      
         in your case.          

05:20.800 --> 05:22.300
     Do you have the time?      

05:22.300 --> 05:24.100
             4:30.              

05:24.200 --> 05:25.800
                Good, 'cause    
                I just wanted   

05:25.800 --> 05:27.600
                to remember     
                the exact moment

05:27.700 --> 05:29.500
        I met the biggest jerk  
        on Earth.               

05:29.500 --> 05:32.500
         ( <i>Sam laughs</i> )         

05:32.500 --> 05:34.100
Tough woman, tough woman.       

05:34.100 --> 05:35.600
You got that right.             

05:35.700 --> 05:37.900
I wear a cup to work.           

05:40.400 --> 05:42.200
        Well, the pulsating     
        Dave Machine's history. 

05:42.200 --> 05:43.700
All right, man,                 
take care.                      

05:43.700 --> 05:45.000
                Excuse me, Dave.

05:45.000 --> 05:45.900
                Dr. Crane here. 

05:46.000 --> 05:47.100
        If you're interested,   

05:47.200 --> 05:49.200
            I happen to conduct 
            a little session    

05:49.200 --> 05:52.200
            for narcissists     
            about once a month. 

05:52.200 --> 05:55.100
My policy: only show up         
if I get an award.              

05:56.700 --> 05:59.000
  This is the Big Dave Machine  
    saying good night           

05:59.000 --> 06:01.300
and may the sports be with you. 

06:02.600 --> 06:03.700
                    You know,   

06:03.700 --> 06:05.500
I bet if you held your ear      
        up to his,              

06:05.500 --> 06:06.700
you could hear the ocean.       

06:08.700 --> 06:11.100
 I'll have to try it sometime.  

06:12.900 --> 06:16.100
                It, uh, may not 
                work for you.   

06:19.600 --> 06:21.500
Hey, guys,                      

06:21.500 --> 06:22.700
I'm off to the station.         

06:22.700 --> 06:24.400
     Listen, do me a favor,     
            will ya?            

06:24.400 --> 06:26.000
 Woody, Carla, close up for me. 

06:26.100 --> 06:27.100
          You know...           

06:27.100 --> 06:28.900
 Whoa, Sammy, you're forgetting 
        something               

06:28.900 --> 06:30.100
    a little important here.    

06:30.100 --> 06:30.800
             What?              

06:30.900 --> 06:32.200
    You don't own this joint    
            anymore.            

06:32.300 --> 06:34.000
Oh, boy.                        
            And even if you did,

06:34.100 --> 06:36.300
    Field Marshal Howe          
wouldn't give you the night off.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.400
Yeah, yeah.                     
Silly me.                       

06:38.500 --> 06:40.600
        What am I going         
        to do about this, huh?  

06:40.600 --> 06:42.200
Sam, may I suggest deception?   

06:42.300 --> 06:43.600
            Well...             

06:43.600 --> 06:45.400
            Hold on your horses 
            there, Frasier.     

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
            As a psychiatrist,  

06:46.400 --> 06:48.900
            isn't it your job   
            to seek and uphold  
            the truth?          

06:48.900 --> 06:51.100
Oh, get real, Cliff.            

06:51.100 --> 06:54.100
    You know, you got           
  a good idea there, Frasier.   

06:54.200 --> 06:56.100
          Yeah. Lying.          

06:56.200 --> 06:57.300
          I do lying.           

06:57.400 --> 07:00.500
Woody, come here. Do me a favor.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.200
When Miss Howe comes out        
of the office here,             

07:02.300 --> 07:05.200
            go down the hall    
            and call the bar.   

07:05.200 --> 07:06.800
                I'll answer.    

07:06.900 --> 07:07.800
                What do I say?  

07:07.900 --> 07:10.100
Nothing.                        
Just stand there                
and hold the phone.             

07:10.200 --> 07:12.200
            Okay, I'll give it  
            a try.              

07:16.800 --> 07:20.900
         Um, Miss Howe,         
 we're running low on napkins.  

07:21.000 --> 07:22.900
                So order more.  

07:22.900 --> 07:24.700
  I don't know how many more.   

07:24.800 --> 07:26.800
  I don't run the bar anymore.  

07:28.900 --> 07:30.600
Thank you.                      
I appreciate this               
very much.

I'll get it.                    

07:36.200 --> 07:37.300
Cheers.                         

07:37.300 --> 07:39.100
Yeah, this is Sam Malone.       

07:39.100 --> 07:42.200
         What? You say          
  my apartment's been robbed?   

07:42.200 --> 07:43.500
Oh, Sammy!                      

07:43.500 --> 07:45.700
            You say             
     I've been cleaned out?     

07:45.700 --> 07:48.400
          Well, damn.           

07:48.400 --> 07:50.800
     Yeah, I guess I could      
get over there right away       

07:50.800 --> 07:52.400
and maybe expect not            
to be back here                 

07:52.500 --> 07:53.700
for a few hours, huh?           

07:55.500 --> 07:58.100
Well, thank you very much.      
        Thank you.

      a relief bartender.

Woody, are you using this phone?

      No, no, not really.

the phone, please.              

08:55.300 --> 08:57.700
         I have to hire         
     another bartender now.     

08:57.800 --> 09:00.600
    Oh, no, Miss Howe,          
    I'm really sorry.           

09:00.600 --> 09:02.200
I swear I'll never do it again.

              Thank you, Joanne.

              Very slick indeed.

Yes. Five bucks says            
Sammy has Joanne at 11:00.

              MAN:              
    Today on <i>This Old House,</i>    

10:00.500 --> 10:02.400
we're going to be grouting      
         counter tile,

    so I'm sure you'll want     
to stick around for that.       

10:04.800 --> 10:07.100
      But first, let's go       
        in the kitchen.         

10:07.100 --> 10:08.900
        Don't you guys          
        usually watch sports?   

10:08.900 --> 10:10.800
Yeah, well, yeah,               
usually, but, uh,               

10:10.800 --> 10:13.900

  And now for the <i>I on Sports</i>   
          <i>commentary.</i>           

10:22.600 --> 10:25.800
      You know, the world       
  is full of negative people.   

10:25.800 --> 10:28.400
 Okay, so the Sox aren't having 
      such a great season,      

10:28.500 --> 10:31.800
  but that's no reason to boo   
 and say bad things about them. 

10:31.800 --> 10:33.600
     You know, I don't know     
    where I heard it,           

10:33.600 --> 10:35.800
but I thought you were supposed 
      to root, root, root       

10:35.800 --> 10:37.300
    for the home team.          

10:37.300 --> 10:39.300

    you're in Fenway,           

10:39.300 --> 10:42.500
 you can't yell something nice, 
  don't yell anything at all.   

10:44.400 --> 10:46.600
         This has been          
    just one guy's opinion.     

10:46.700 --> 10:48.000
            Joanne?

And we're clear.                

10:57.000 --> 10:59.600
         That was quite         
    a commentary, Sam.          

10:59.700 --> 11:01.600
     Well, I hope I didn't      
    offend anyone, you know?    

11:01.700 --> 11:03.000
        I just feel like        
    it had to be said.          

11:03.100 --> 11:05.000
    Mm. Would you mind          
  a little friendly critique?   

11:05.000 --> 11:05.800
    No, no. Go ahead.

 I know this is the first time  

11:07.200 --> 11:09.400
    you've done this,           
but I think you might want      

11:09.500 --> 11:11.400
    your commentaries           
     to be a little more...

      I'm searching for?

      Interesting. Right.       

11:17.500 --> 11:19.800
    You know, that gives me     
 something to shoot for there.  

11:19.800 --> 11:23.600
             Say, uh, there's a 
             late-breaking story

            over at my place

fluff pieces.

And in five, four,              
three, two...                   

11:35.000 --> 11:37.300
  Well, it was a little chilly  
    coming into work today.

            This looks really   
            fascinating.        

11:49.200 --> 11:50.800
Oh, I'll say.                   
Gee, you should've seen         

11:50.800 --> 11:52.500
this guy put the flasher        
on the roof.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.900
 And I am not just saying that  
 in order to get a free beer.   

12:33.000 --> 12:34.800
                  If the spirit 
                  does move you,

12:34.900 --> 12:37.600
 Sammy, I take a size 12 sudsy. 

12:37.700 --> 12:38.500
     Hey, thank you, guys.      

12:38.600 --> 12:42.200
You know, coming from you,      
        it means a lot.         

12:44.000 --> 12:45.900
            So, Carla...        
            how was I really?   

12:45.900 --> 12:48.200
It was like watching            
old people eat.                 

12:50.700 --> 12:52.500
You delivered the sports fine,  

12:52.600 --> 12:55.000
but you got to jazz up          
the commentary.                 

12:55.100 --> 12:56.900
        Yeah, yeah, boy, they   
        said that same thing    

12:56.900 --> 12:57.900
            down at the station.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.400
    You know, you got           
    to talk about something     

12:59.400 --> 13:00.700
         a little more          
      interesting than...       

13:00.700 --> 13:01.800
rooting for the home team.      

13:01.900 --> 13:05.000
      That's like saying,       
"let's all drive safely."       

13:05.000 --> 13:07.300
     There goes tomorrow's      
          commentary.           

13:10.200 --> 13:12.500
You know, I want to do          
so great at this job,           

13:12.500 --> 13:14.900
but it's kind of tough,         
you know?                       

13:14.900 --> 13:17.900
I got to come up with           
five opinions a week.           

13:17.900 --> 13:21.100
Well, they couldn't             
pay me enough.                  

13:24.000 --> 13:26.100
You know, I'll worry            
about this later.               

13:26.200 --> 13:28.400
Right now I got to get          
Rebecca to give me              

13:28.400 --> 13:30.200
the rest of my nights off.      

13:30.300 --> 13:30.900
    No problem there, Sammy.    

13:30.900 --> 13:32.400
         I don't think          
     you work here anymore.     

13:32.400 --> 13:35.100
What are you talking about?     

13:35.100 --> 13:36.500
                  Vampira knows.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.500
             She was watching TV
             in her office.     

13:38.500 --> 13:40.600
She has a TV in there?          

13:40.600 --> 13:43.800
      Yeah, one of those little 
      tiny ones, like her heart.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.900
    Great.                      

13:47.800 --> 13:48.900
         Uh, Ms. Howe?          

13:49.000 --> 13:50.400
I have a confession to make.    

13:50.500 --> 13:52.800
You know that story about       
my apartment being robbed?      

13:52.800 --> 13:54.300
I made that all up.             

13:54.300 --> 13:57.500
                        No!     

13:57.500 --> 13:58.600
          Yeah, yeah.           

13:58.700 --> 14:02.200
      Actually, I was down      
         at Channel 13          

14:02.200 --> 14:04.100
doing the sportscast.           

14:04.200 --> 14:06.100
Hope you're not mad.            

14:06.200 --> 14:07.800
                 Well, you used 
                 to be the boss.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.200
        How did you feel when   
        people lied to you?     

14:10.200 --> 14:12.500
Ah, well, I had a rule.         

14:12.500 --> 14:20.200
When anyone ever lied to me,    
they had to go to bed with me.  

14:20.200 --> 14:26.600
    Well, that's one way to make
    sure it won't happen again. 

14:26.600 --> 14:28.400
        You know, Mr. Malone,   
        you haven't been        

14:28.400 --> 14:29.200
         dealing fairly with me.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.300
I know, I know.                 

14:30.300 --> 14:31.900
I'm sorry.                      

14:31.900 --> 14:34.600
It's just that this...          
this means a lot to me.         

14:34.700 --> 14:36.500
          And now I suppose     
          you're going to ask me

14:36.600 --> 14:38.000
                for the rest    
                of the week off.

14:38.100 --> 14:41.100
Yeah, I know,                   
it's a lot to ask.              

14:41.100 --> 14:42.200
                No, it isn't.   

14:42.300 --> 14:43.600
                      You're on.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.500
        Oh, great.              
 What, am I fired or something? 

14:45.500 --> 14:46.900
                     Not at all.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.800
         Look, I figure one of  
         two things will happen:

14:48.900 --> 14:50.800
         either you'll do well, 
         they'll offer you a job

14:50.800 --> 14:52.300
                  and I'll never
                  see you again;

14:52.300 --> 14:53.600
             or you'll screw up,

14:53.600 --> 14:55.200
              humiliate yourself
              and come back here

14:55.200 --> 14:56.700
                 a crushed      
                 and broken man.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.200
              Either way, I win.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.800
         Son of a gun,          
    you do have heart.          

15:02.800 --> 15:04.400
        Of course I do.         

15:04.500 --> 15:05.800
Tell me though.                 
What'd you think?               

15:05.900 --> 15:07.400
How'd I look out there?         

15:07.500 --> 15:09.100
             I've never seen you
             look better.       

15:09.100 --> 15:10.100
Really?                         

15:10.100 --> 15:13.100
            You should always   
            be this size.       

15:15.000 --> 15:16.800
Let me give you                 
some advice here:               

15:16.900 --> 15:19.700
never do this to a guy.         

15:26.800 --> 15:28.600
     Guys, guys, he's about     
to do the commentary here.      

15:28.700 --> 15:30.500
Anybody know what               
the topic's going to be?        

15:30.600 --> 15:33.000
     Well, no, no, he said      
  he was going to crank it up   

15:33.000 --> 15:34.500
    by taking a firm stand.     

15:34.600 --> 15:37.100
        Hey, Woody, wasn't he   
        rehearsing with you?    

15:37.100 --> 15:39.200
Yeah, but he made me promise    
not to tell you guys.           

15:39.300 --> 15:41.700
It's too exciting.              

15:41.700 --> 15:46.400
And I don't remember.           

15:46.400 --> 15:48.000
    Tonight I'm going           
      to tackle the issue       

15:48.000 --> 15:50.700
         that's tearing         
  professional sports apart--   

15:50.700 --> 15:53.800
         natural grass          
      or artificial turf?       

15:55.600 --> 15:57.000
      Now this reporter's       
    not afraid to say           

15:57.000 --> 16:00.200
that he's firmly in favor       
    of natural grass.           

16:00.200 --> 16:02.800
          It's softer,          
     causes fewer injuries,     

16:02.800 --> 16:06.200
and let's face it, folks:       
it looks prettier on TV.        

16:06.200 --> 16:08.700
 That's just one guy's opinion. 

16:08.700 --> 16:10.000
            Joanne?             

16:10.100 --> 16:13.400
  Gee, Sam, I heard somewhere   
that in an indoor stadium       

16:13.400 --> 16:15.900
        it's impossible         
      to grow real grass.       

16:18.300 --> 16:19.300
     Well, yes, yes, uh...      

16:19.400 --> 16:23.100
      in indoor stadiums,       
you have to use the fake stuff. 

16:23.100 --> 16:25.500
And I've heard that some of     
the more recent synthetic blends

16:25.500 --> 16:27.000
actually do help                
reduce injuries.                

16:27.000 --> 16:28.200
              Oh.               

16:31.500 --> 16:33.400
Well, I hadn't heard that, Doc. 

16:33.400 --> 16:35.200
     That's pretty amazing.     

16:35.300 --> 16:37.100
     So what are you saying     
        here, Sam?              

16:37.200 --> 16:42.900
 Well, I guess I'm saying that  
 I could go either way on it.   

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
So you have no opinion on this? 

16:45.000 --> 16:48.100
    No, I have two opinions.    

16:50.100 --> 16:52.800

 saying I was taking advantage  
of my status as an ex-ballplayer

17:22.900 --> 17:26.599

 shouldn't be doing the sports.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.200

19:24.900 --> 19:26.300
  It just felt great up there.  

19:26.300 --> 19:29.600
 I tell you, ever since I sold  
 the bar I've been floundering. 

19:29.600 --> 19:31.500
     It's like I'm standing     
         in quicksand.          

19:31.500 --> 19:33.200
        You know, I've been     
        trying to get my feet   

19:33.300 --> 19:34.300
        planted on the ground   

19:34.300 --> 19:36.200
         and all of a sudden,   
         it's all come together.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.100
      It's like everything      
I've ever done in my life       

19:38.200 --> 19:40.100
      has been leading up       
        to this moment.         

19:40.200 --> 19:45.500
My knowledge of sports, my good 
  looks, my ability to rhyme.   

19:45.500 --> 19:49.000
 You know, I tell you, I think  
I found my niche in life.       

19:49.100 --> 19:51.100
They liked you down             
at the station?                 

19:51.200 --> 19:52.600
Are you kidding, liked me?      

19:52.700 --> 19:54.600
Man, they were speechless.      

19:56.300 --> 19:59.200
    Oh, hey, yeah, Rebecca.     

19:59.200 --> 20:01.400
Listen, uh, did you             
catch my act tonight?           

20:01.500 --> 20:02.600
                     Yes, I did.

20:02.700 --> 20:03.800
So what'd you think?            

20:03.900 --> 20:05.300
 Now you can be honest with me. 

20:05.400 --> 20:06.400
                Honest?         
Mm-hmm.                         

20:06.500 --> 20:07.800
                Let's see...    

20:07.800 --> 20:10.300
        as news rappers go,     
        I thought you were fine.

20:11.400 --> 20:15.000
    But maybe rapping has just  
    been kind of done to death. 

20:15.000 --> 20:17.200
     Oh, no, you think so?      

20:17.200 --> 20:20.000
I mean, I'd hate to think       
I looked stupid out there.      

20:20.000 --> 20:21.400
             No, no, not at all.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.600
No, no, no,                     
it's just that                  

20:22.700 --> 20:24.400
                 it's not unique
                 anymore, Sam.  

20:24.500 --> 20:25.800
        I mean, uh, you know,   

20:25.800 --> 20:27.900
      it'd be one thing if you  
      were the first guy to rap,

20:27.900 --> 20:29.800
         but they're rapping on 
         stations all over town.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.100
            You don't want to be
            the last on a long  
            train of rappers.   

20:32.100 --> 20:33.700
             Yeah, Norm is right
             there, Sammy.      

20:33.700 --> 20:35.500
I mean, you got to do           
something different.            

20:35.500 --> 20:36.700
Do something revolutionary,     

20:36.800 --> 20:39.500
something that no sportscaster  
does anymore.                   

20:39.500 --> 20:43.000
You know, like, uh...           
read the sports.                

20:44.900 --> 20:46.900
        You know, I have been   
        working on something,   

20:46.900 --> 20:48.900
                but I was afraid
                it was too much.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.700
    But if you guys think       
    that rapping's old hat...   

20:51.700 --> 20:54.700
            you know, I just may
            give it a shot.     

20:54.800 --> 20:59.000
 I'm going to work on it right  
now, as a matter of fact.       

20:59.100 --> 21:00.400
                Suppose we ought
                to stop him?    

21:00.500 --> 21:01.600
     Oh, no, wait a minute.     

21:01.600 --> 21:03.500
How do we know it's going       
    to be another bad idea?     

21:03.500 --> 21:06.700
 I mean, it couldn't be as bad  
     as tonight, could it?      

21:06.700 --> 21:09.900
    ( <i>high-pitched voice</i> ):     
         Hi, everybody.         

21:10.000 --> 21:11.200
    ( <i>normal voice</i> ):           
        Hi, Little Sam.         

21:11.200 --> 21:12.500
 Are you ready for tonight's... 

21:12.500 --> 21:15.000
                    Oh, my God. 

21:15.000 --> 21:16.900
          LITTLE SAM:           
          I sure am.            

21:16.900 --> 21:19.100
      I think the Red Sox       
    are making a big mistake    

21:19.100 --> 21:21.200
trading away young players      
          for veterans          

21:21.300 --> 21:23.600
     who can only help them     
      for a season or two.      

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600
                Don't you agree,
                Little Sam?     

21:25.600 --> 21:28.200
No, I think                     
you're full of hooey.           

21:29.500 --> 21:31.700
If I paid five bucks            
to get in the ballpark,         

21:31.700 --> 21:35.400
I want to see them win now.     

21:35.400 --> 21:36.600
            What do you know?   

21:36.600 --> 21:38.500
             Your head's wooden.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.900
Well, your lips                 
are moving.                     

21:40.900 --> 21:43.700
If either of them mentions      
      the bar, I'm suing.       

21:45.500 --> 21:46.700
            Stop it.            

21:46.700 --> 21:51.100
Well, that's two guys' opinions.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.000
    Joanne?                     

22:00.000 --> 22:01.700
Oh, boy.                        

22:01.700 --> 22:06.900
It seemed like such             
a good idea at the time.        

22:07.000 --> 22:12.400
 Boy, I wanted that job so bad. 
I wanted to make it work.       

22:12.400 --> 22:14.900
      I guess I just went       
      over the edge, huh?       

22:14.900 --> 22:17.700
        Hey, make him talk, Sam.
        Make him say my name.   

22:20.800 --> 22:22.200
      Maybe later, Woody.       

22:22.200 --> 22:24.100
My lips are kind of tired       
        right now.              

22:25.600 --> 22:27.500
    I know things seem          
a little bleak right now,       

22:27.600 --> 22:29.500
        but, um, I think        
  there's two important things  

22:29.500 --> 22:30.500
        to look at here.        

22:30.500 --> 22:31.600
                            One:

22:31.600 --> 22:33.100
  at least you took a chance.   

22:33.200 --> 22:34.800
                    And two--   

22:34.800 --> 22:37.200
and this is the important one-- 

22:37.200 --> 22:39.500
     you know when to quit.     

22:39.500 --> 22:41.600
    Yeah, boy, that's true.     

22:41.700 --> 22:42.700
You know,                       

22:42.800 --> 22:45.200
  I came real close to losing   
      my dignity tonight.       

22:47.000 --> 22:48.900
  I've been thinking about it,  

22:49.000 --> 22:52.500
 you know, I'm going to hang up 
the old Channel 13 blazer.      

22:52.600 --> 22:55.000
    You know, if that phone     
    were to ring right now      

22:55.000 --> 22:57.900
    and they were to beg me     
to come back, I wouldn't do it. 

22:58.000 --> 22:59.500
          I think it's just time

22:59.500 --> 23:02.100
         that I grew up         
         and accepted what I am:

23:02.100 --> 23:03.200
                    a bartender.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.700
        And a damned good one   
        at that, too.           

23:04.700 --> 23:06.300
        ( <i>phone rings</i> )         

23:06.400 --> 23:08.200
            Cheers.             

23:08.200 --> 23:10.300
    It's the station.           

23:10.300 --> 23:12.800
Well, you're kidding me.        

23:12.800 --> 23:15.500
The switchboard's               
lighting up?                    

23:15.600 --> 23:17.200
Well, look, hey.                

23:17.200 --> 23:19.400
Listen, I'm sorry,              
I don't care if they loved me.  

23:19.400 --> 23:22.600
I happen to have                
a job already...                

23:22.700 --> 23:24.000
and I have friends...           

23:25.500 --> 23:26.800
and I have my dignity.          

23:26.900 --> 23:28.200
    Yeah.                       

23:28.200 --> 23:30.100
Well, thanks anyway.            

23:30.200 --> 23:31.500
Yeah, bye-bye.                  

23:33.200 --> 23:35.600
                 Very admirable,
                 Mr. Malone.    

23:35.600 --> 23:38.000
Well, I still have              
a little nobility left.         

23:38.100 --> 23:38.900
All right.                      

23:39.000 --> 23:40.800
Okay, Sam.                      

23:40.900 --> 23:43.000
          Oh, I have to cancel  
          that relief bartender.

23:43.100 --> 23:46.000
Oh, maybe                       
you ought to, uh...             

23:46.000 --> 23:47.600
                Hello?
