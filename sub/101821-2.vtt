WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:06.131
Hey, back up.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.091
What do I look like,
the information lady?

00:08.133 --> 00:10.635
Hell, no.
I'm a law enforcement officer,

00:10.677 --> 00:11.970
emphasis on the enforcement.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.097
You need to know what happened
last week on  Shameless?

00:14.139 --> 00:16.558
Better go find someone
who actually gives a shit.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.184
rock music

00:18.226 --> 00:19.769
[insistent knocking]

00:19.811 --> 00:21.229
[Kev]  City of Chicago says

00:21.271 --> 00:23.815
all bars are closed
until further notice.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.526
Hail, 'rona survivors!
Where is everyone?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.737
The mayor shut us all down
again on Tuesday.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.947
Well, who the hell
can keep track?

00:30.989 --> 00:32.615
[Lip]  I made
a big mistake, son.

00:32.657 --> 00:33.783
I rented this house
without asking

00:33.825 --> 00:34.784
your mommy first,

00:34.826 --> 00:36.828
and now I'm basically
her bitch.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.872
[Frank] Holy shit!

00:38.913 --> 00:39.956
What the hell is that?

00:39.998 --> 00:40.874
[Veronica] Hands off, Frank.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.000
We're not offering credit

00:42.042 --> 00:44.627
on cannabis products.
Payment up front only.

00:44.669 --> 00:45.879
Debbie needs her share
of the utilities.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.422
Want me to get
some shitty-ass

00:47.464 --> 00:48.423
minimum-wage job like you,

00:48.465 --> 00:49.591
hauling boxes
around a warehouse?

00:49.632 --> 00:51.301
[Ian]
What the fuck is this?

00:51.342 --> 00:52.719
I go and get our money,

00:52.761 --> 00:54.804
all I find is IOUs.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.765
You spent all our money
from the wedding?

00:56.806 --> 00:58.683
Did you eat all the brownies?

00:58.725 --> 00:59.976
I had three,

01:00.018 --> 01:01.728
and Tommy had four.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.812
We were hungry.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.776
With the loss of
so many officers to the 'rona,

01:07.817 --> 01:09.569
the bosses are willing
to put you on the street.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.779
It's not a tough call
to give you a badge.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.739
Busting heads
is a man's job,

01:12.781 --> 01:14.783
and you are a natural born
ass kicker.

01:14.824 --> 01:15.825
[grunts]

01:15.867 --> 01:17.118
[Ruger]
Congratulations, Gallagher.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.870
You're gonna get to be one
of the best of the best,

01:18.912 --> 01:21.498
a goddamn Chicago
police officer.

01:21.539 --> 01:24.125
Thank you, sir.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.550
rock music

01:36.221 --> 01:39.307
Think of all
the luck you got

01:39.349 --> 01:42.727
Know that
it's not for naught

01:42.769 --> 01:45.814
You were beaming
once before

01:45.855 --> 01:50.151
But it's not like that
anymore

01:50.193 --> 01:53.738
What is this downside

01:53.780 --> 01:57.033
That you speak of?

01:57.075 --> 01:59.077
What is this feeling

01:59.119 --> 02:02.497
You're so sure of?

02:10.338 --> 02:14.092
Round up
the friends you got

02:14.134 --> 02:17.095
Know that
they're not for naught

02:17.137 --> 02:20.140
You were willing
once before

02:20.181 --> 02:24.811
But it's not like that
anymore

02:24.853 --> 02:27.981
What is this downside

02:28.022 --> 02:31.526
That you speak of?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.653
What is this feeling

02:33.695 --> 02:37.699
You're so sure of?

02:38.867 --> 02:41.828
rock music

02:44.789 --> 02:48.126
Watch out, crackheads.
Coming back for you later.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.004
Making a mental note
of your face, shitbag.

02:56.801 --> 02:57.927
Watch it, ladies.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.345
Might haul your asses
down to the station.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.639
Yeah, that's right.
You're looking at the po-po.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.516
First day on the job.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.732
My birthday!

03:14.903 --> 03:17.071
Wake up!
[knocks]

03:18.865 --> 03:21.367
Wake up!
I'm five!

03:23.661 --> 03:25.788
[Lip] Hey, hey.
Look who it is.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.584
The birthday girl.
[sniffles, sighs]

03:32.253 --> 03:33.796
Presents?

03:33.838 --> 03:34.756
Oh, no, no.

03:34.797 --> 03:35.924
It's not like Christmas,
Franny.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.008
You're gonna get your presents

03:37.050 --> 03:38.343
tonight at your party.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.552
Oh.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.386
Hey.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.638
Come on.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.640
Let's go make some breakfast,
huh?

03:43.681 --> 03:45.850
[whooshes]

03:45.892 --> 03:46.935
Whoof!

03:46.976 --> 03:48.686
Go sit!

03:48.728 --> 03:49.687
Yo, what up?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.189
Why'd you guys
sleep here last night?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.523
Oh, the fumes at our new place

03:52.565 --> 03:53.983
from resurfacing the bathtub.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.485
Good morning, Franny.
Happy birthday.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.569
Thank you.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.737
[Lip] These up for grabs?

03:57.779 --> 03:58.988
- No, don't touch.
- Why?

03:59.030 --> 04:00.907
I'm gonna sell them for cheap
to the lunch debt kids.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.200
What's a lunch debt kid?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.202
[Liam] Kids who run out
of money on their food account.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.913
Can't eat the hot lunch
till they pay up.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.164
Is that even legal?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.999
Don't public schools
have to feed the kids?

04:10.041 --> 04:12.377
Yeah, but the lunch lady
serves them gross shit

04:12.418 --> 04:13.795
like stale bread,

04:13.836 --> 04:15.505
government cheese,
chunky pudding.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.966
So you're capitalizing
on the misfortunes of others

04:18.007 --> 04:20.009
by selling them
your peanut butter sandwiches?

04:20.051 --> 04:22.178
The American way.
See you.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.556
Hey, there's
my sweet birthday princess!

04:25.598 --> 04:27.058
Who is five today?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.268
- Me!
- [Debbie] You? Ah!

04:28.309 --> 04:31.938
I don't know!
She looks like a big girl.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.231
Did you grow overnight?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.149
Are you sure you're not 15?

04:35.191 --> 04:36.234
I am!
I am!

04:36.276 --> 04:37.860
[Sandy] Yeah, I knew you were.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.862
Are you excited
for your princess party?

04:39.904 --> 04:41.239
I hate princesses!

04:41.281 --> 04:42.782
What?
No, you don't.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.367
I'm with Frans
on this one.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.911
Hey, no.
I invited your entire class.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.371
There's gonna be
a bouncy house.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.290
We're gonna get
a bunch of decorations

04:50.331 --> 04:51.916
at the dollar store.
It's gonna be great.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.334
Hey, can I tag along
to the dollar store?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.545
- Sure.
- Homeboy needs more diapers.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.256
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.800
Hey, hey, hey, birthday Franny.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.094
Hey, look what I got you
from work.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.930
They let us keep stuff if it's
past its expiration date.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.265
There's so much stuff
that just gets

05:07.307 --> 05:08.683
thrown away into a dumpster.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.476
Oh, great job, man.
Free old cereal.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.729
[Ian] Yeah, at least I have
a real job.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.063
Get off my back.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.523
Hey, Debs,
I'm finally gonna get

05:15.565 --> 05:17.108
my first paycheck later,

05:17.150 --> 05:19.152
so I can start paying
for my part of the bills.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.445
- [Debbie] Great.
- Wait, what?

05:20.486 --> 05:21.779
I didn't plan on supporting
a husband.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.864
You gotta pull your weight.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.574
I told you, I am still
on my honeymoon.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.826
We need money for food, rent.

05:26.868 --> 05:27.869
Great.
I could go get money

05:27.910 --> 05:28.953
in 30 fucking seconds.

05:28.995 --> 05:29.996
Legal money.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.247
Look, they're hiring
over at my warehouse.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.832
You could go over there today
and apply.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.417
Thanks, no thanks.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.918
All right, if you don't get
a real job today,

05:35.960 --> 05:37.503
you're not getting
any more sex.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.546
[Lip] Whoo-hoo!

05:38.588 --> 05:39.505
[Mickey] Oh, no, please.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.506
I don't give a shit, man.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.550
I don't need
your disgusting-ass dick.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.968
[laughter]

05:44.010 --> 05:46.721
Ah, you guys been married what,
like, 50 years now?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.264
- 5-0!
- Oh, fuck, it's the cops!

05:48.306 --> 05:50.141
- Hey, I'm unarmed!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

05:50.183 --> 05:52.352
Ha, ha, ha, very funny,
assholes.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.020
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'ma go load

05:54.062 --> 05:55.980
these bad boys up
with armor-piercing rounds

05:56.022 --> 05:57.899
so I can keep
the mean streets safe

05:57.940 --> 05:59.817
for fuck-heads like you guys.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.985
Watch out, Chicago!

06:01.027 --> 06:03.196
You're going down.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.909
- Here you go, Kerm.
- Thanks, Kev.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.495
May there be many more
where this comes from.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.373
[knocking at door]

06:19.504 --> 06:20.755
Hey, Tommy.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.548
Kev.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.095
Kermit.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.554
Tommy.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.522
Why are you two sitting
so far apart from each other?

06:37.563 --> 06:40.108
- Social distancing.
- Take a beer, Kev.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.193
Yeah, sure, of course.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.279
[Veronica] Okay, call me
when you have more.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.989
Elijah from the dispensary

06:47.031 --> 06:48.408
doesn't have weed either, Kev.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.075
Shit.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.868
Whole city's run out.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.204
Another symptom
of economic anxiety:

06:53.246 --> 06:56.290
everyone's self-medicating.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.042
Why are you two sitting apart?

06:58.084 --> 06:59.877
- No reason.
- Nothing.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.171
[quietly] I think
they're having a fight.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.257
A fight?
About what?

07:04.298 --> 07:06.175
[Kev] Saying something
under your breath means

07:06.217 --> 07:07.718
"keep it quiet."

07:07.760 --> 07:09.846
[Frank] Hello!
I'm here.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.265
Oh, Frank!

07:12.306 --> 07:14.642
You gotta use the secret knock.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.019
Oh, sorry.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.896
Top of the morning to you.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.399
So what you got for me
to sample today

07:21.441 --> 07:23.359
in the wonderful world of weed,

07:23.401 --> 07:27.196
Master Kev, Mistress V?

07:27.238 --> 07:29.740
What are--why are you guys
sitting so far apart?

07:29.782 --> 07:30.908
One of you fart or something?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.827
- Just because.
- Stop asking.

07:32.869 --> 07:33.911
Jesus, fine.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.247
Sit in your own stank,
for all I care.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.124
[Veronica]
They won't tell us either.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.168
Oh.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.294
Where are the goods?

07:41.335 --> 07:42.587
[Veronica] Sold out.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.921
Impressive.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.673
But our suppliers
are out of product now.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.217
Ever since the 'rona,
there's been a rush on weed.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.427
They were not prepared
for the demand.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.387
- Everyone's out.
- It's a blessing in disguise.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.347
- Pot is dangerous.
- Amen to that.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.640
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.517
That's impossible.
There's no such thing

07:56.559 --> 07:59.103
as a rush on weed.
It's in abundance.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.438
There's
three different dispensaries

08:00.480 --> 08:02.690
- we use for our product.
- [Kev] They're all out.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.566
Dispensaries?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.736
You know what kind
of a markup they've got?

08:06.777 --> 08:08.529
I can get you more product.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.280
Where?

08:09.322 --> 08:10.531
Yeah, illegal shit.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.909
Marijuana's
basically just a weed.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.368
The government has
no more right

08:14.410 --> 08:16.704
to regulate it
than they do sunflowers.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.206
Or making us wear masks.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.415
Exactly!

08:19.457 --> 08:22.293
Don't worry.
I can get you more product.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.837
We can go in on this
together, partners.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.797
- Yes.
- No!

08:28.424 --> 08:30.718
[whispering] I am not going
into the weed business

08:30.760 --> 08:31.928
with Frank Gallagher.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.346
Frank Gallagher's
the best person to go

08:33.387 --> 08:34.514
- in the weed business with.
- Shh.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.349
I was whispering so that
means to talk quietly.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.433
Well, now you know
how it feels.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.394
Veronica, I understand
your reluctance.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.189
I would feel the same
if I were going

08:43.231 --> 08:44.649
into business with me.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.277
May I suggest we do
a trial run today?

08:48.319 --> 08:50.738
Give me a chance
to prove myself.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.323
I will find you weed,

08:52.365 --> 08:55.284
I will teach you how to make
the best edibles in the city,

08:55.326 --> 08:58.955
and then I will help you
sell those edibles

08:58.996 --> 09:00.248
at a premium.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.209
I was born to do this.

09:03.251 --> 09:07.630
I've been training for it
my whole fucking life.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.926
Frank Gallagher really is
an illegal drug connoisseur, V.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.264
Fine, a trial run
just for today.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.849
Elijah should have
some legal product in stock

09:18.891 --> 09:20.059
in a couple of days.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.894
You will not regret this.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.938
- [sprays disinfectant]
- Oh.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.690
[laughs]

09:25.731 --> 09:27.066
Nah, it's...

09:29.277 --> 09:32.238
brassy music

09:48.713 --> 09:49.422
[applause]

09:49.463 --> 09:50.548
[Tipping]
Look at those virgins.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.508
This is the freshest meat
I've ever seen.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.552
[Simmons]
Yanez, over here.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.470
I'ma Denzel Washington
your ass today.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.848
Officer Tipping,
Carl Gallagher.

09:58.889 --> 09:59.807
I believe I'm your partner.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.268
Stand down, son.
No need for formality.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.103
- Bring it in.
- Uh, really?

10:04.145 --> 10:05.521
We've all been tested.
You wouldn't be here

10:05.563 --> 10:07.315
if you were positive.
Now bring it in.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.482
[patting]

10:08.524 --> 10:11.193
Welcome to the Chicago
police force.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.988
[tires screeching]

10:16.282 --> 10:17.825
- [engine turns over]
- [siren wails]

10:17.867 --> 10:19.619
[Lip] All right, first thing
we're gonna do:

10:19.660 --> 10:21.078
we're gonna open up
all the windows,

10:21.120 --> 10:22.747
air out the house.
That way, we don't inhale

10:22.788 --> 10:23.998
any of the fumes.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.041
It's a good idea, right?

10:25.082 --> 10:26.500
"Yeah, Daddy.
You're brilliant."

10:26.542 --> 10:28.127
I know.
Then we're gonna count

10:28.169 --> 10:29.378
all the mismatched
light switches,

10:29.420 --> 10:30.755
see which ones
need to be replaced,

10:30.796 --> 10:33.591
and I need you
on bathroom tile duty.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.176
Think you can do that for me?

10:35.217 --> 10:38.012
Go through and see
where I need to add more grout.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.305
"Yeah, Daddy."
You can?

10:39.347 --> 10:42.850
Well, that's great.
Thank you so much, buddy.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.478
What the actual fuck?

10:54.862 --> 10:57.531
[applause on television]

10:57.573 --> 10:58.824
[Drew Carey]
Now you're probably wondering,

10:58.866 --> 11:00.493
"Why do they call it
'More or Less'?"

11:00.534 --> 11:01.619
- Here's why.
- [contestant]  Okay.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.995
[Drew Carey]
We're gonna start off

11:03.037 --> 11:04.330
with these wireless speakers,

11:04.372 --> 11:05.373
four of them.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.332
$450.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.917
Is the actual price

11:07.958 --> 11:09.293
more or less than $450...

11:09.335 --> 11:11.295
Who cares how much
the speakers cost?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.381
Just steal 'em.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.217
[TV character]  Is--
is this a problem?

11:16.258 --> 11:17.343
Okay.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.053
[TV character 2]
I won't tell if you won't.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.721
[Mickey] Shit, yeah.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.682
[laughs]

11:22.723 --> 11:24.392
Oh, come on, man.
I need more time than that.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.268
What are you doing
sitting on the couch?

11:26.310 --> 11:27.978
Watching TV?
Wasting your life?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.105
I'm not wasting my life.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.147
Do you even have a job?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.399
Do you have a college degree?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.359
No, you don't, do you?
Why not?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.277
'Cause everything's
an excuse with you, isn't it?

11:35.319 --> 11:36.654
Why don't you mind your own
fucking business, Jerome?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.489
"I'll apply to school
next year."

11:38.531 --> 11:39.699
What's wrong with right now?

11:39.740 --> 11:42.535
Stop disappointing
the people you love.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.661
Get off the couch

11:43.703 --> 11:44.704
and go make something
of yourself.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.955
All--all right, okay.
Fuck.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.373
[Jerome]  Consider me
like your guardian angel.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.290
Fine.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.500
You can thank me later.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.836
Now call or email us today.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.714
- Do it!
- Shut the fuck up, Jerome.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.557
This stuff's all expired.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.058
Toss it in the dumpster.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.103
[Spanish music playing]

12:10.062 --> 12:11.689
Those guys have it made, huh?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.607
Sitting on their asses all day.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.192
[George]
You're telling me.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.402
You know they make
ten bucks more an hour

12:16.444 --> 12:17.445
than we do, don't you?

12:17.486 --> 12:18.446
Oh, shit.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.864
Yeah.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.241
How do I apply to be
a forklift driver?

12:22.283 --> 12:23.617
[George] Well, you don't,

12:23.659 --> 12:25.244
unless you're Black,

12:25.286 --> 12:26.328
or you're Mexican,

12:26.370 --> 12:28.122
or you got a twat
between your legs.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.790
You got a twat
between your legs?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.500
Uh, not the last time
I checked.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.669
The days are over
when guys like you and me

12:33.711 --> 12:36.380
got all the opportunities
for advancement.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.341
Sucks to be a white male
in America these days.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.228
Life Saver?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.813
- Huh?
- Wintergreen.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.441
Yeah, sure.
[clears throat]

12:55.483 --> 12:57.151
So I made a list
of everything that I saw

12:57.193 --> 12:58.486
in my neighborhood
this morning.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.695
Lot of illegal activity.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.655
Guns, drugs, car theft.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.657
You ever bite one of these
in the dark

13:03.699 --> 13:04.784
using your back teeth?

13:04.825 --> 13:06.744
- Excuse me?
- The Life Saver.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.579
Uh, no, not that I know of,

13:08.621 --> 13:10.456
but I was thinking that
we could drive by the area.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.499
You know,
there's still probably

13:11.540 --> 13:12.625
a lot of activity going on.

13:12.666 --> 13:13.751
Maybe bust some heads

13:13.793 --> 13:15.377
and drag some bangers
down to the station.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.587
Makes a spark

13:16.629 --> 13:18.547
when you bite the Life Saver
in the dark.

13:18.589 --> 13:19.799
I do it for my kids sometimes.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.550
They get a real kick out of it.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.469
- You have kids?
- I'm 19.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.720
[Tipping] About when I started.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.972
I have a 17 year old
gonna start community college,

13:27.014 --> 13:29.600
and twin eight year olds
with the second wife.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.310
She's not much older than you.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.562
You wanna check this out, sir?
You know...

13:33.604 --> 13:36.857
take a look at the list
for yourself?

13:40.986 --> 13:43.113
Well, if you bust a right
down here on Cermak,

13:43.155 --> 13:44.240
go down about three blocks,

13:44.281 --> 13:45.282
you still might see some
of those guys--

13:45.324 --> 13:46.742
Let me share some things
with you, Carl.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.577
I've been on the police force
15 years.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.121
Do you know how many times
I've been shot?

13:51.163 --> 13:52.289
I don't know.
Five?

13:52.331 --> 13:53.123
Zero.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.250
Wait, you've never been shot?

13:54.291 --> 13:55.960
Never been shot,
never shot at.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.336
You know why?

13:57.378 --> 13:59.004
I don't leave the car.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.256
Seriously?

14:00.297 --> 14:01.757
Personal safety
is no joking matter.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.592
What if something's going on
out there,

14:03.634 --> 14:04.677
like, you know, the street?

14:04.718 --> 14:05.803
Carl, we can do more
for the neighborhood

14:05.845 --> 14:07.221
by staying right here
inside this car

14:07.263 --> 14:09.181
and being a presence.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.308
So you're not gonna do anything
about those prostitutes

14:11.350 --> 14:12.142
over there?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.269
[Tipping] Do you see blood?

14:13.310 --> 14:15.062
- No.
- Anyone crying,

14:15.104 --> 14:16.063
begging for their life?

14:16.105 --> 14:17.064
Not that I can see.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.649
[Tipping] Then we let them know
we're here...

14:18.691 --> 14:19.567
[honks horn]

14:19.608 --> 14:21.151
...and we go on our way.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.238
[sighs] Okay.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.407
Another Life Saver?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.453
Are we seriously gonna buy
illegal weed

14:31.495 --> 14:33.247
from some random dude
on the street?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.165
They're not random.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.584
That's Scotty in the beanie.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.419
Lori L. on the stoop.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.628
That guy doing ballet
over there

14:39.670 --> 14:41.046
probably has some good stuff.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.131
[Frank] Who, Herman?

14:42.172 --> 14:43.674
Yeah, his product isn't bad,

14:43.716 --> 14:44.842
when he has it.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.927
Usually by mid-morning,
he's smoked it all up.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.014
On disability.
Got hit by an Uber.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.558
Tiny Tod over there
has the cheapest weed,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.560
but it's mostly stems.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.854
I don't know about this.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.856
These folks aren't doing
any harm.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.649
It's the
law-abiding rich people

15:00.691 --> 15:02.693
who decided
to legalize marijuana

15:02.735 --> 15:03.986
who are messing up a system

15:04.028 --> 15:06.363
that's been in place
for decades.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.616
Trust me, these folks
have good product.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.118
upbeat music

15:11.160 --> 15:13.287
Let's buy from Gina.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.705
[Kev] Who, Twitchy McGee?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.583
[Frank] Exactly.
She's jonesing.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.586
Probably H.
She's desperate.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.837
Has to score soon,

15:21.879 --> 15:23.547
so she'll want to make
a quick sale.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.215
[car alarm wails]

15:25.257 --> 15:26.550
All right, I'm going in.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.718
Cash, please.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.554
Better not run away
with our money, Frank.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.724
Veronica, please.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.476
This is good.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.102
This'll probably get us
four ounces.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.354
Then back to your place.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.688
We'll cook up some goodies.

15:46.236 --> 15:46.987
What happened?

15:47.029 --> 15:48.572
We never talked
about our split.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.490
What split?

15:49.531 --> 15:50.532
As business partners.

15:50.574 --> 15:51.659
Temporary business partners.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.619
I think 50/50's fair.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.745
Sounds reasonable to me.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.829
Fuck that.
There's two of us

15:55.871 --> 15:57.498
and one of you.
A three-way split.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.334
Sounds reasonable to me.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.128
Got yourselves a deal.
Partners.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.630
Go get 'em, tiger.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.842
[Frank]
Gina, did you miss me?

16:08.884 --> 16:12.388
[music playing faintly]

16:12.429 --> 16:16.266
Ooh, they have tiaras
and magic wands.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.438
You guys, where are you?
They have fairy dust.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.690
[Tami]  En garde!

16:22.731 --> 16:24.566
Take that, bad guy.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.653
Ah, this is my land.
You'll never win the battle.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.737
[both grunting]

16:28.779 --> 16:29.697
Get her, Franny.

16:29.738 --> 16:30.948
I got her!
I got her!

16:30.990 --> 16:34.034
Look, I can dress like a
unicorn princess for the party.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.412
Huh?

16:36.453 --> 16:37.621
Hi-yah!

16:37.663 --> 16:39.707
- [cell phone rings]
- Oh.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.958
Hi, babe.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.461
Uh, your sister is going psycho
for the princess crap.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.088
Uh, hey.
So, um, you know how you're mad

16:46.130 --> 16:47.965
I'm spending a lot of money
we don't have on the house?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.968
Yes.
Accept defeat, warrior!

16:51.010 --> 16:53.721
Well, someone broke
our two front windows.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.848
What the serious fuck?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.182
[Lip]  That's what I said.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.769
How do we feel about
this mermaid princess look?

17:00.811 --> 17:02.938
Uh, okay, so we gotta call
the cops.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.441
No, the cops won't do anything
about a broken window.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.400
We'd have to lie and tell them

17:06.442 --> 17:07.818
there was
a murder or something.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.653
Hey.
Why are you hitting me?

17:09.695 --> 17:12.614
She switched sides.
Us against you now.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.783
So I was thinking I'm gonna
change out the windows,

17:14.825 --> 17:16.952
and, uh, I was actually
gonna replace them

17:16.994 --> 17:19.038
- with double glaze anyway.
- [Tami]  Double glaze?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.414
They more expensive
than regular?

17:20.456 --> 17:21.790
Okay, stop.
This is the safe zone.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.001
I am in the safe zone.
Do not come closer.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.462
That sounds expensive, Lip.
Is it?

17:26.503 --> 17:29.131
A little bit.
Not much.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.508
[Tami]  Ugh, we gotta stop
hemorrhaging money.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.718
[clattering sound]

17:32.760 --> 17:35.262
[engine roaring,
tires screeching]

17:35.304 --> 17:36.388
Oh, come on!

17:36.430 --> 17:37.848
I'm just saying
we're spending--

17:37.890 --> 17:40.100
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I wasn't talking to you.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.771
[grunts]

17:43.812 --> 17:45.814
Someone just dumped
a bunch of trash

17:45.856 --> 17:48.108
in our new yard
and in our planters.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.485
Why?

17:49.526 --> 17:51.528
I don't know.
I don't see anyone.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.864
It must've been
some punk-ass kids.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.532
I gotta put a sign up,
let people know...

17:55.574 --> 17:57.117
[shouting]
...a Gallagher lives here!

17:57.159 --> 17:58.702
Then they won't mess
with us anymore.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.870
[Tami, incredulously]
Yeah, okay.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.206
Um, how's Fred?

18:02.247 --> 18:03.832
Oh, uh, good.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.626
Good.
Happy. Good.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.627
I gotta go.
Bye!

18:06.668 --> 18:09.004
- Bye.
- [Debbie] Okay, I found it.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.048
I'll be a fairy princess
for the party.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.592
Isn't this the perfect dress?

18:17.805 --> 18:20.474
So you worked five years
at Home Depot,

18:20.516 --> 18:21.934
three at Lowe's,

18:21.975 --> 18:24.520
and served two active duties
in Afghanistan.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.897
- Yep.
- Impressive.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.273
[clears throat]

18:28.315 --> 18:30.317
Oh, shit.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.028
Whoops.
Uh, you forgot to put

18:33.070 --> 18:35.405
your Social Security number
on the application.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.324
Yeah, it's, uh,

18:37.366 --> 18:40.619
three...seven...22.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.371
That's only four numbers.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.581
How many is it supposed to be?

18:44.623 --> 18:46.166
Why don't you just
text it to me later?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.585
- Yeah.
- So Mr. Milkovich,

18:48.627 --> 18:50.254
let's do a little role-play.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.839
Oh, I'm not
into that shit anymore.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.006
I got married.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.676
[laughs] No, no.
Professional role-play.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.010
- Oh, yeah.
- [interviewer] Let's say

18:57.052 --> 18:58.846
you're working at the register.
[clears throat]

18:58.887 --> 19:01.390
I'm a customer who comes in,
and I wanna return a saw.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.309
What are some questions
you might wanna ask me?

19:04.351 --> 19:06.854
Okay.
Uh...

19:06.895 --> 19:08.522
How many times you use it?

19:08.564 --> 19:09.690
Where'd you steal that from?

19:09.731 --> 19:10.816
You think you can scam me?

19:10.858 --> 19:12.109
[shouting] You think
I'm fucking stupid?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.069
Is there blood on that shit?

19:14.111 --> 19:16.822
Uh, not exactly
what I was looking for.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.115
Hey, okay.
You know, hey.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.950
I-I'm really good at scaring
the crap out of people,

19:19.992 --> 19:21.952
so I can say whatever
you want me to say

19:21.994 --> 19:24.788
so people stop returning shit.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.790
Good--good to know.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.458
Maybe dealing directly
with the customers

19:28.500 --> 19:31.253
is not the best job for you.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.839
Look...

19:33.881 --> 19:37.759
I-I really want
to make it work here, so...

19:37.801 --> 19:41.305
W-w-what are they doing?
Can I do that job?

19:41.346 --> 19:44.099
Oh, yeah.
Inspecting the expiration dates

19:44.141 --> 19:45.392
on our stored food supply.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.936
Anything doesn't meet
our high standard of freshness

19:47.978 --> 19:49.646
is disposed of.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.773
- So thrown out?
- [interviewer] That's right.

19:51.815 --> 19:52.941
Why don't you just tell me
a little bit more

19:52.983 --> 19:54.234
about yourself?

19:54.276 --> 19:56.570
What assets do you think
you bring to the workplace?

19:56.612 --> 19:57.696
Bro, I can bring whatever

19:57.738 --> 19:58.906
you fucking want
to the workplace.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.657
I got, like...
What--what do you need?

20:00.699 --> 20:03.035
Glocks? Nunchucks?
Fuck, I got bayonets.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.078
I got whatever you want.
I got you--

20:05.120 --> 20:07.998
or I know who does, okay?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.666
I'm--I'm sorry, Mr. Milkovich.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.960
I don't think this job's
the right fit for you.

20:12.002 --> 20:15.088
What do you mean?
I...

20:15.130 --> 20:17.925
You know what?
Goddamn right, it's not.

20:17.966 --> 20:21.220
I don't need to be out here,
making minimum-ass wage,

20:21.261 --> 20:22.721
tossing out
perfectly good food,

20:22.763 --> 20:23.972
getting blisters
all over my hands

20:24.014 --> 20:26.975
so I can clock out
with a bunch of fucking bozos,

20:27.017 --> 20:29.186
go home smelling
like a rotten fucking pig.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.772
This is your fault
for making me do this shit.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.440
Fuck you, and fuck you,

20:33.482 --> 20:35.734
and especially fuck you.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.492
Shake that...

20:43.533 --> 20:45.953
[Tipping]   Ass for me,
shake that ass for me

20:45.994 --> 20:47.079
Come on, girl

20:47.120 --> 20:49.206
Shake that ass for me

20:49.248 --> 20:50.791
Shake that ass for me

20:50.832 --> 20:51.959
Come on, girl, shake

20:52.000 --> 20:53.126
That ass for me

20:53.168 --> 20:54.753
Shake that ass for me

20:54.795 --> 20:56.046
Okay, it's your part.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.340
I'm a menace, a Dennis,
an oral hygienist

20:58.382 --> 21:00.509
Open your mouth for about
four or five minutes

21:00.550 --> 21:02.135
Take a little bit
of fluoride with it

21:02.177 --> 21:03.720
Swish but don't spit it

21:03.762 --> 21:04.930
Swallow and I'll finish

21:04.972 --> 21:06.473
[dispatch]  Attention,
all officers.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.391
[quietly] Thank God.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.059
Damn, we almost got through
the whole thing.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.978
That song makes me feel
kind of badass.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.272
- You too?
- Uh, sure.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.231
[dispatch]  Attention,
all officers,

21:14.273 --> 21:15.440
we have a 312 in progress.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.192
- 700 block of Riverside.
- Hell yeah.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.360
[dispatch]  Convenience store
robbery.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.028
Four suspects,
armed and dangerous.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.905
Any and all officers
in the area, please respond.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.115
It's go time.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.
What are you doing there?

21:24.992 --> 21:26.576
Have you learned nothing today?

21:26.618 --> 21:27.536
We're so close.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.663
No, no, no, there's officers
much closer than we are.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.831
We're, like, two blocks away.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.708
I've seen this before.
By the time we get there,

21:32.749 --> 21:33.709
someone will have gotten shot,

21:33.750 --> 21:35.127
and Homicide will take over
the case.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.296
So let's just stay
out of their crime scene.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.047
But it's our duty
to take the call.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.091
Trust me on this one.
We're partners.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.677
Need to stick together,
be a united front,

21:43.719 --> 21:46.763
have each other's back.
Okay?

21:46.805 --> 21:47.931
Okay.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.850
[Tipping]
You'll thank me one day.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.018
Fucking bored shitless.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.478
Now can we get back
to our song?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.814
Girl, shake that ass
for me

21:55.856 --> 21:57.858
Shake that ass for me

21:58.775 --> 22:00.694
All due respect, Veronica,

22:00.736 --> 22:02.070
your brownies were awful.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.238
Really?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.782
Did you fry the marijuana
in butter first?

22:05.824 --> 22:07.242
No, she didn't.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.036
What difference does that make?

22:09.077 --> 22:11.997
It's the difference
between a ghetto pot brownie

22:12.039 --> 22:13.832
and a culinary delight.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.042
By frying the weed,

22:15.083 --> 22:17.794
you activate the cannabinoids.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.838
reggae music playing

22:19.880 --> 22:22.883
Here, stir this for me,
will you?

22:22.924 --> 22:25.594
Also, the lipids in the butter

22:25.635 --> 22:27.262
bond with the weed to form

22:27.304 --> 22:29.806
the perfect cannabis infusion.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.183
Yeah, V.

22:31.224 --> 22:35.645
Now, let's see
how our first batch looks.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.106
Oh, yeah.
[laughs]

22:38.148 --> 22:39.858
[Kev] Oh, those smell amazing.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.817
Eh?

22:40.859 --> 22:43.070
Kev, my fine feathered friend,

22:43.111 --> 22:45.155
I need you to cut
that pan of brownies

22:45.197 --> 22:47.240
into two-by-two squares.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.993
Each square has to be
equal size and shape.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.787
I want ten perfect brownies.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.996
Aye-aye, captain.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.415
That's $200 worth of heaven
right there.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.875
$200?

22:56.917 --> 23:00.212
That's, like, a lot of money
for each brownie.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.630
20 bucks a brownie, Kev.

23:01.671 --> 23:02.339
Holy shit.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.965
The going rate is ten, Frank.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.467
Nobody's gonna dish out 20.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.636
That's because no one
has tasted

23:07.677 --> 23:09.971
Frank Gallagher's masterpiece

23:10.013 --> 23:12.140
of psychedelic goodness yet.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.560
I'll speak the truth
even if you never understand

23:22.359 --> 23:25.529
rock music

23:27.030 --> 23:28.907
Hey, Kendall.
What can I do you for?

23:28.949 --> 23:31.159
Back up.
Keep your distance.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.285
What's up?

23:32.327 --> 23:34.913
Can't eat this crap
the lunch lady gave me.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.918
How much for
a peanut butter sandwich, Liam?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.254
Donations only.
Whatever you got.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.926
Um...

23:47.968 --> 23:50.220
stole this Red Bull
from the corner store.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.972
That'll work.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.766
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.935
This is not an open-air market.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.271
It is a liability
for you to sell food

23:59.312 --> 24:00.230
on school property.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.273
That's mine.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.941
I'm not selling it.
Donating it.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.901
Well, you can't do that,
either.

24:04.943 --> 24:05.944
What, share my lunch?

24:05.986 --> 24:07.070
No.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.822
So it's okay
for these underprivileged kids

24:08.864 --> 24:10.073
to starve
because they don't want

24:10.115 --> 24:12.492
to eat the slop you give them?

24:12.534 --> 24:14.327
Until they pay
their lunch debt,

24:14.369 --> 24:15.745
that's all they get.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.832
Now close it down.

24:18.874 --> 24:19.875
Sorry, everyone.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.461
Loraine won't let me donate
sandwiches to you anymore.

24:22.502 --> 24:25.797
- [student] That sucks!
- [students booing]

24:25.839 --> 24:26.965
I know, I know.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.842
It hurts me just as much
as it hurts you.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.302
I didn't grow up
with money, either,

24:30.343 --> 24:32.220
but ever since
I was a little kid,

24:32.262 --> 24:34.264
it's been my passion
to give to those

24:34.306 --> 24:35.474
less fortunate than myself.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.058
- [child ] Yeah!
- [child] You're the man, Liam.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.185
Please.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.561
If I had extra money,

24:39.603 --> 24:41.271
I'd give it
to all my friends here

24:41.313 --> 24:42.731
so they could buy hot lunch,

24:42.772 --> 24:43.565
but since I don't,

24:43.607 --> 24:45.942
I thought the next best thing
would be

24:45.984 --> 24:48.153
is to donate food
from my family's kitchen.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.030
- [crowd cheering]
- [student] Yeah, Liam!

24:50.071 --> 24:51.490
Please, please, please.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.366
I'm just one man
trying to make a difference.

24:53.408 --> 24:56.077
I won't take up
any more of your time.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.668
- [students cheer]
- [student] Bye, Loraine.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.338
[student] Go, Liam.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.715
Now, who wants a sandwich?

25:11.176 --> 25:13.762
This one is when the twins
dressed like salt and pepper

25:13.803 --> 25:14.971
for Halloween.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.182
The condiments,
not the hip-hop group.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.100
You do realize people
just keep photos

25:19.142 --> 25:20.602
- on their phone now, right?
- [stomach rumbles]

25:20.644 --> 25:24.272
Ooh, I got some rumbles
in my tumbles.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.982
You hungry?

25:26.024 --> 25:27.150
For police action.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.944
What about for eggplant pea?

25:28.985 --> 25:30.487
Best this side of Milwaukee.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.447
- I guess.
- Let's do this.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.949
[clears throat]
Dispatch,

25:33.990 --> 25:35.909
this is Officers Tipping
and Gallagher.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.410
[dispatch]  Go for dispatch.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.038
A concerned citizen
just stopped us...

25:40.080 --> 25:41.414
What are you talking about?
We've been at--

25:41.456 --> 25:43.083
...and reported
a suspicious person

25:43.124 --> 25:44.709
over on Hemlock Street.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.211
We're gonna investigate.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.462
[dispatch]  Copy that.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.714
Report back your findings
and if you need backup.

25:49.756 --> 25:50.924
Will do.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.259
What the hell
was that all about?

25:52.300 --> 25:53.843
Buys us more time for lunch.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.513
Eggplant pea, here we come.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.139
So let me get this straight.

25:58.181 --> 26:00.517
We don't respond
to real crimes in progress,

26:00.559 --> 26:02.269
but we do respond
to fake crimes

26:02.310 --> 26:03.436
that aren't even happening?

26:03.478 --> 26:04.980
You're getting the hang
of this.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.815
This is so
not what I signed up for.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.609
Your tum-tum will thank me.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.119
[Mickey] Right on time.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.080
rock music

26:27.127 --> 26:29.713
Nice truck, fatty.

26:42.058 --> 26:44.436
Ding Dongs for a ding-dong.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.942
Ugh, smelly fucking fat-ass.

26:50.984 --> 26:51.985
I'm gonna get pinkeye

26:52.027 --> 26:54.195
from all the farts
in this thing.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.700
- [engine turns over]
- Ugh.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.077
Jack-fucking-pot.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.621
Later, Jabba the Hutt!

27:02.662 --> 27:05.832
[truck driver] Hey.
Hey, hey!

27:05.874 --> 27:08.209
Hey, get the door for me,
would you, Val Kilmer?

27:08.251 --> 27:09.586
[yelps]

27:12.881 --> 27:14.966
Asshole!

27:21.640 --> 27:23.600
Did you and Tommy
get in a fight about something?

27:23.642 --> 27:26.269
- Just drop it.
- Oh.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.687
He owe you money?

27:27.729 --> 27:30.398
Has for years,
but that's not it.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.026
What, did you wreck his car?

27:34.402 --> 27:36.446
I wish it were something
so simple.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.824
[knocking at door]

27:45.914 --> 27:47.666
- Yeah?
- Hi.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.584
We heard
you're selling edibles here,

27:49.626 --> 27:51.461
and we were told to ask

27:51.503 --> 27:54.172
for the marijuana magician.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.301
Come on in!
He's right here.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.136
I'll show you to him.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.137
Didn't catch your names.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.847
Barry, and he's Ryan.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.933
Sure.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.519
The one and only Frank.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.728
Have a seat, gentlemen.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.980
How can the Frank
help you today?

28:11.022 --> 28:13.191
Selection looks impressive.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.568
So what do you have here?

28:15.610 --> 28:17.487
[Frank] I've arranged
my products

28:17.529 --> 28:19.948
in descending order of THC.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.200
Starting here at the top tier,

28:22.242 --> 28:25.286
I call this "Can't-Get-Off-
The-Couch Cookie."

28:25.328 --> 28:27.205
- [Barry] Yowza.
- I don't want that.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.498
I still need to do work
every day.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.084
Uh, you and me both, brother.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.210
Continuing down the line,

28:32.252 --> 28:34.337
we reduce the THC
until we get

28:34.379 --> 28:35.922
to the bottom shelf

28:35.964 --> 28:37.340
and our homemade suckers,

28:37.382 --> 28:39.467
which are basically all CBD.

28:39.509 --> 28:42.262
What do you think is best
to give me a buzz

28:42.303 --> 28:44.723
but also help my sciatica?

28:44.764 --> 28:48.143
I would stick somewhere here
in the middle.

28:48.184 --> 28:50.186
These chocolate walnut brownies

28:50.228 --> 28:52.272
have the perfect amount of THC

28:52.313 --> 28:54.149
to give you a little euphoria,

28:54.190 --> 28:55.400
and the CBD

28:55.442 --> 28:57.402
to relieve that pain
in your ass.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.945
Should we get two?

28:58.987 --> 29:01.573
We're going to that foam party
this weekend.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.241
Let's make it four, then.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.201
[Frank] Four it is.
If you would pay

29:05.243 --> 29:07.370
my sales clerks behind the bar,

29:07.412 --> 29:09.748
I will bag these up for you.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.210
[Kev] Excellent, gentlemen.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.588
Four brownies.
So that's, uh...

29:16.629 --> 29:18.548
[Veronica] $80.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.884
Well, this is fucking vile.

29:20.925 --> 29:21.801
Morning, Lip.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.512
Hey, Marsha.
How's Georgia doing?

29:24.554 --> 29:26.931
Got into a bowl
of butterscotch candy

29:26.973 --> 29:28.308
I have out for guests.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.393
Didn't you?
Ate the wrappers and all.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.478
That right?

29:31.519 --> 29:34.481
I'll be picking up
poopy candy bits for days.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.566
Hey, uh, you didn't see

29:36.608 --> 29:38.151
who did any of this,
did you?

29:38.193 --> 29:39.611
What?

29:39.652 --> 29:41.404
Oh, broke my front window,

29:41.446 --> 29:42.947
you know, put all this trash
in the yard.

29:42.989 --> 29:45.116
I thought the house
was always like this.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.201
Yeah, when Mr. Shaw lives here,

29:46.242 --> 29:47.452
but I've been trying
to fix it up.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.912
You buy the place?

29:48.953 --> 29:49.954
No, just renting.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.624
Spending a lot of money
if it's not yours.

29:52.665 --> 29:54.209
Yeah, well, I want
some nice things in my life

29:54.250 --> 29:55.460
for a change.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.587
Well, good for you.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.130
- Thank you.
- [Fred] Da-da.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.257
[laughs]

30:01.299 --> 30:03.259
Hey, Marsha.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.053
You see any punk-ass kids
running around here,

30:05.094 --> 30:06.179
you let me know?

30:06.221 --> 30:07.847
You got it, Lip.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.682
Thanks.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.108
Thanks, Ma.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.902
Of course, sweetie.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.987
Oh, that's Arthur

30:23.029 --> 30:25.865
on his honeymoon
with his first wife, Nadine.

30:25.907 --> 30:29.077
Oh, you people sure are
into hard copy photos, huh?

30:29.118 --> 30:31.621
[laughs]
I loved Nadine.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.331
I really do miss her.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.666
[Tipping]
Ma, she cheated on me,

30:34.707 --> 30:36.835
with five different
police officers--five.

30:36.876 --> 30:39.546
Well, she certainly had a type.

30:39.587 --> 30:40.922
You gotta give her that.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.716
Oh, Carl, can I give you
another serving?

30:43.758 --> 30:45.552
Oh, no, Mrs. Tipping, I--

30:45.593 --> 30:47.804
Oh, Rhoda.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.931
You're part of the family now.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.725
Okay.
Uh, no thank you, uh, Rhoda.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.352
I'm not too big
on heavy lunches.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.229
Besides, we gotta get
back out to the streets.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.647
Oh, right, right, right,
right, right.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.691
Thanks for reminding me.
[clears throat]

30:59.732 --> 31:00.859
Dispatch, come in, please.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.402
[dispatch]  You've got dispatch.

31:02.443 --> 31:04.362
This is Officer Tipping.
Officer Gallagher and I

31:04.404 --> 31:05.613
have located the suspect,

31:05.655 --> 31:07.407
and we are now proceeding
with questioning.

31:07.448 --> 31:10.285
[dispatch]  Copy that.

31:10.326 --> 31:14.539
I am so proud of you, Arty.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.957
- Oh, both of you.
- Mm.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.209
[chuckles]

31:18.251 --> 31:21.045
Mm.

31:21.087 --> 31:23.339
Family.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.674
[Rhoda] Goodbye, boys.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.634
You know what I like to do
after a big meal?

31:26.676 --> 31:28.052
Oh, I don't know.
Do your job?

31:28.094 --> 31:28.887
Catch some rapists?

31:28.928 --> 31:30.763
Take a nap
over at the Best Buy.

31:30.805 --> 31:32.265
Have you ever sat in one

31:32.307 --> 31:34.142
of the massage recliners
they have there?

31:34.183 --> 31:35.768
No, but I'm sure I will now.

31:35.810 --> 31:39.814
My lower lumbar
could really use some kneading.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.692
Dispatch, the suspect
has directed us

31:42.734 --> 31:44.527
to an abandoned house

31:44.569 --> 31:46.905
that has a suspicious smell
emanating from it.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.782
Officer Gallagher and I
will investigate further.

31:49.824 --> 31:51.784
[dispatch]  Copy that.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.338
[Debbie] Hey, it's starting
to look

32:03.379 --> 32:04.756
like a magic castle in here.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.634
[Tami] Or like a Care Bear
took a giant shit.

32:07.675 --> 32:10.511
Or Strawberry Shortcake
fucked My Little Pony.

32:10.553 --> 32:11.971
Yeah, or Glinda the Good Witch

32:12.013 --> 32:13.348
just, like,
projectile vomited--

32:13.389 --> 32:15.016
Okay, I get it.
Stop making fun of me.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.185
This is gonna be
the best party ever.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.686
Yeah, for you.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.105
What do you mean?
It's Franny's birthday.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.065
[helium whooshing]

32:22.106 --> 32:24.484
You just seem
a little more into it

32:24.525 --> 32:25.860
than Franny does, babe.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.821
That is so not true.
Franny's so into it.

32:28.863 --> 32:31.157
I mean, what little girl
doesn't want a princess party?

32:31.199 --> 32:32.742
I never wanted one.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.410
Me neither.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.371
I did.

32:36.412 --> 32:38.498
Well, that explains it.

32:38.539 --> 32:39.916
Explains what?

32:39.958 --> 32:42.418
Why you're so obsessed
with all this shit.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.754
I am not obsessed.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.131
The magic wands don't go there.
On the coffee table.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.591
Oh, okay.
Sorry.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.593
I just--I never got
the princess manual.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.845
I was always into G.I. Joes
and shit when I was a kid,

32:52.887 --> 32:54.764
so that's the kind of parties
I had.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.140
Yeah, well, every birthday,
one of my uncles

32:56.182 --> 32:59.185
would just get me drunk
and let me shoot his gun.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.854
The bounce house is here!

33:01.896 --> 33:03.272
- Yes!
- Hell yeah!

33:03.314 --> 33:04.023
Love a bounce house.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.692
- Whoo!
- I've never been in one.

33:05.733 --> 33:06.943
What?

33:06.985 --> 33:08.778
Uh, none of the adults
were sober enough

33:08.820 --> 33:10.613
to make me a cake,
never mind

33:10.655 --> 33:12.073
get a bounce house.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.701
You were seriously
raised by wolves.

33:14.742 --> 33:17.453
[generator whirring]

33:17.495 --> 33:19.706
It's supposed to be
a princess castle.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.290
You sure?

33:21.332 --> 33:22.667
Paperwork says Dracula's Lair.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.419
Oh, she's sure.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.004
Now why would I order
Dracula's Lair

33:26.045 --> 33:29.048
for a five-year-old girl's
birthday party?

33:29.090 --> 33:31.551
I love it!

33:32.010 --> 33:34.679
I need a princess castle.
Get me a princess castle.

33:34.721 --> 33:35.722
Sorry, ma'am,
we don't have

33:35.763 --> 33:39.183
anything extra on the truck.

33:39.225 --> 33:40.101
[scoffs]

33:40.143 --> 33:42.020
Well, this is
the worst thing ever.

33:42.061 --> 33:44.814
I think it's kind of cool.
Come on!

33:44.856 --> 33:47.608
It says "Bounce-ilvania," Debs.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.944
What could be more fun
than that?

33:49.986 --> 33:53.197
rock music

33:55.867 --> 33:58.327
Okay, all bets in?

33:58.369 --> 33:59.912
Shit.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.831
I got nothing.
Pair of tens.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.589
Full house.
Sorry about that, boys.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.548
Crap.

34:10.590 --> 34:11.841
How is it
the new kid always wins?

34:11.883 --> 34:13.342
Beginner's luck.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.094
Uh, yeah.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.929
- Franklin Pierce...
- Loitering...

34:16.971 --> 34:18.806
- James Buchanan...
- Littering.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.391
- [Tipping] Abraham Lincoln.
- [Carl] Actual B&E.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.642
[Tipping] Andrew Johnson.

34:21.684 --> 34:22.518
Defacing property.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.853
Ulysses S. Grant.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.064
Ah, shoot, I can't remember
who was next.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.191
- Who's the 19th president?
- I don't know.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.068
I didn't even know
there was 19 presidents.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.612
- Pfft.
- Ah, more loitering.

34:32.653 --> 34:35.907
Battery.

34:35.948 --> 34:37.075
Oh, my God, what is that?

34:37.116 --> 34:38.826
What? Where?
What is it?

34:38.868 --> 34:40.286
- Go time, is what it is.
- [siren wailing]

34:40.328 --> 34:41.704
This car has a siren?

34:41.746 --> 34:42.705
Let's move it, people!

34:42.747 --> 34:43.831
And a megaphone?

34:43.873 --> 34:46.375
[Tipping] Hang on, partner.

34:48.544 --> 34:50.379
This is what I'm talking about!

34:50.421 --> 34:51.756
[tires screech]

34:51.798 --> 34:52.840
Go.

34:55.551 --> 34:56.511
Put these on.

34:56.552 --> 34:57.637
What's going on?
What's happening?

34:57.678 --> 34:59.806
- Where are we going?
- Traffic light is out.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.682
Good thing
we were in the vicinity.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.476
You stand on that side.
I'll stay here.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.685
[car horns honking]

35:11.359 --> 35:15.238
- [driver honks horn]
- Out of the road, asshole!

35:16.739 --> 35:20.993
Watch your star
all by yourself

35:21.035 --> 35:24.914
Fame, but I don't die

35:26.707 --> 35:28.167
All I want

35:28.209 --> 35:32.004
I won't be here,
you're all--

35:35.633 --> 35:38.386
Yo, what up, Jose?

35:38.427 --> 35:40.054
Looking good, man.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.056
Yeah, you too.
I'm not used to seeing

35:42.098 --> 35:44.100
your cracker ass
on this side of the wire.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.935
So what's this deal
you got for me?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.562
Right here.

35:47.603 --> 35:48.813
A dumpster?

35:48.855 --> 35:50.106
Man, what kind of idiot
you think I am?

35:50.148 --> 35:53.151
No, no, ain't like that.
Look, check it out.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.027
Boom!

35:58.531 --> 35:59.448
Damn.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.449
[Mickey] Uh-huh.
I told you.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.034
[Jose] Wait, what is all this?

36:02.076 --> 36:03.661
It's food.
The fuck you think it is?

36:03.703 --> 36:04.996
No, I mean,
where did you get it?

36:05.037 --> 36:08.040
Difference does that make?
I got it, didn't I?

36:08.082 --> 36:09.709
I could really use
some of this shit.

36:09.750 --> 36:10.751
Uh-huh.

36:10.793 --> 36:13.629
Pasta, oatmeal...

36:13.671 --> 36:15.798
flour.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.258
How much you want?

36:17.300 --> 36:21.220
Hey, for you,
give you a good price.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.099
Wait a minute.
This is expired.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.226
- So what?
- It says 2019.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.187
It's fucking pasta, man.
Doesn't go bad.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.938
Yeah, well, I hate the guys
in this joint

36:30.980 --> 36:32.648
just as much as anybody,
but I'm not trying to give them

36:32.690 --> 36:33.858
salmonella or some shit.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.277
Will you quit being a bitch?
Those dates don't mean shit,

36:36.319 --> 36:37.653
and you know it.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.822
You--you're a fucking asshole.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.741
Hey, a'ight, man.
Whatever.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.492
No problem.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.077
All good.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.329
Got plenty other cooks
out there

36:46.370 --> 36:48.956
willing to take this off
my hands for...

36:48.998 --> 36:52.126
oh, half what they usually pay
for their bulk items.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.836
Charge their boss
the same amount,

36:53.878 --> 36:56.756
and guess what?
They just pocket the rest.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.800
peppy music

37:00.760 --> 37:02.845
Uh-huh.
You interested now.

37:04.764 --> 37:07.225
[laughs]

37:08.392 --> 37:10.436
Ah, there you go.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.979
Hmm.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.439
All right.

37:13.481 --> 37:14.941
There you go, Framingham.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.859
Oh, gee, thanks.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.070
Pretty boy.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.739
Thanks.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.450
Hey, uh, you want to get
a couple of drinks,

37:24.492 --> 37:25.618
piss away our paychecks?

37:25.660 --> 37:27.453
Ah, not tonight.
Thank you.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.704
All right, suit yourself.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.456
Yeah.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.631
Hey, George.
Hey, wait up.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.008
What's going on?

37:41.050 --> 37:44.095
Who do I talk to about
a mistake with my paycheck?

37:44.136 --> 37:45.763
Oh, let me see this.

37:45.805 --> 37:46.889
What's the mistake?

37:46.931 --> 37:48.432
Look at here.
It says I worked 39 hours.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.476
I worked 45.
I should be getting overtime.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.353
Yeah, that's what they do.
They dock you for lunch,

37:52.395 --> 37:54.021
the time it takes
to go to the head,

37:54.063 --> 37:56.524
anything to keep it
under 40 hours.

37:56.565 --> 37:57.483
- You serious?
- Yeah.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.318
That way, they don't have
to give you benefits.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.654
- They get away with that?
- They do.

38:03.197 --> 38:05.908
Oh, even at 39 hours,
the money's not adding up.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.202
Ah, dude, they take out
all kinds of crap.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.246
Locker fees, safety vests,
you name it.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.414
It's usually about four months

38:11.455 --> 38:13.165
before you're even getting
a full paycheck.

38:13.207 --> 38:16.627
Welcome to a working man's
America, Kemosabe.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.766
Yo, Gallagher,
how'd it go today?

38:30.808 --> 38:32.143
Damn, what happened to you?

38:32.184 --> 38:33.769
Broke his cop cherry.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.230
Best day of my life.
Kicked so much ass.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.857
- Jesus.
- Senior officers

38:37.898 --> 38:39.984
are taking us to the cop bar
across the street.

38:40.026 --> 38:42.570
Celebrate you tadpoles
becoming real women.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.196
Hell yeah.
I'm in.

38:44.238 --> 38:45.781
Hey, you not coming?

38:45.823 --> 38:46.949
Gotta see the fam.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.784
Yeah, don't even bother
with Lady Arthur over there.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.161
He's allergic to fun.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.620
Hurry up and get changed,
Gallagher.

38:51.662 --> 38:52.663
Meet us over there.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.123
I suggest you get
some rest, Carl.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.083
Hey, why would I get
some rest?

38:56.125 --> 38:58.210
We didn't do shit today.
All we did was rest.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.628
I wanted to have
an action-packed day

38:59.670 --> 39:00.713
like Yanez did,

39:00.755 --> 39:02.089
not sing along to Eminem.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.383
A security guard would've had
more fun than we did.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.093
But I put up with it.
Know why?

39:06.135 --> 39:07.970
Because you said we gotta have
each other's backs,

39:08.012 --> 39:10.514
be a united front.
I was bored shitless today.

39:10.556 --> 39:13.559
I don't care, 'cause I wanna be
the best partner that I can be.

39:13.601 --> 39:16.520
So the least you can do
is walk across that street

39:16.562 --> 39:19.398
and buy me a damn drink.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.026
All right, partner.
One drink.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.195
rock music

39:24.236 --> 39:27.782
[all chanting "Chug"]

39:31.243 --> 39:35.706
[cheers and applause]

39:35.748 --> 39:37.666
Damn.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.126
Your partner seems pretty wild.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.170
Yeah, first I've seen that.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.005
Oh, shit.
I think he's married.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.674
Oh, that's okay.
Tina doesn't care.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.802
So first day, huh?

39:47.843 --> 39:49.220
Yeah.
What do you do?

39:49.261 --> 39:50.888
I'm over
at the leather factory.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.848
Mm.
Like coats and stuff?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.141
No, not as glamorous.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.268
We make bullet bags
and rifle slings.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.145
It sucks.
I stink like cow shit

39:58.187 --> 40:00.689
and chemicals all the time.
Smell me.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.274
Uh, well...

40:02.316 --> 40:04.819
Yeah, smell--
smells great to me.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.237
Aw, you're sweet.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.988
If I'm still at the factory
in five years,

40:08.030 --> 40:09.615
I give you permission
to shoot me.

40:09.657 --> 40:10.950
[laughs] Okay.

40:10.991 --> 40:12.576
No, seriously.

40:12.618 --> 40:16.163
Take that big old gun of yours
and shoot me.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.833
And what would you rather
be doing instead?

40:18.874 --> 40:20.543
Mm, marry a cop,

40:20.584 --> 40:22.211
be his wife,

40:22.253 --> 40:23.963
have a bunch of his kids.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.047
Uh...

40:25.089 --> 40:27.216
Don't worry, bunny.
We're just having fun.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.176
So why'd you want to be po-po?

40:29.218 --> 40:31.178
Um, you know,
make a difference,

40:31.220 --> 40:32.179
do something for the community,

40:32.221 --> 40:33.848
be a part of the solution.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.266
- Uh, when I was a kid--
- Wanna fuck?

40:35.307 --> 40:37.601
- Wait, what?
- Come on.

40:37.643 --> 40:39.186
Okay.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.855
Oh, leave it.
We'll be right back.

40:40.896 --> 40:41.856
Your place close?

40:41.897 --> 40:42.982
Yeah, but we're not
going there.

40:43.023 --> 40:44.650
Me and my ex
still live together.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.444
Randy, guard our drinks.

40:46.485 --> 40:49.155
Let's go.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.698
Where are you guys going?

40:50.739 --> 40:52.199
Bathroom.
Come with?

40:52.241 --> 40:53.659
- Want to?
- No.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.995
Yes.
Absolutely.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.833
I can't believe we sold
all that product in one day.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.376
Ye of little faith.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.837
No one even flinched
at the high prices.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.882
Guys, weed is in my blood,

41:07.923 --> 41:09.425
literally and figuratively.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.052
I know the business
inside and out.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.387
Guess you were right, Frank.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.222
I don't hear that often enough.

41:15.264 --> 41:18.809
We made $3,400.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.060
- What?
- [Frank] Course we did.

41:20.102 --> 41:24.064
Mm, mm, mm,
that's $1,133 apiece.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.274
Take your pile.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.110
Oh, it's been lovely
doing business with you.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.904
Shall we do it again tomorrow?

41:29.945 --> 41:31.405
I don't see why not.
V?

41:31.447 --> 41:34.867
Until our suppliers
are back up and running, sure.

41:34.909 --> 41:35.951
Excellent.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.830
I shall see you
bright and early...

41:39.872 --> 41:41.707
and by that, I mean noon.

41:41.749 --> 41:42.416
[laughter]

41:42.458 --> 41:44.835
And I liked helping you out
today

41:44.877 --> 41:46.420
with your emergency,

41:46.462 --> 41:48.172
but the trial run is over.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.049
From this point
going forward,

41:50.090 --> 41:52.510
the cut will be 60/40.
I'm the 60.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.512
- Seems fair to me.
- No way.

41:54.553 --> 41:57.932
I got the raw materials.
I did the manufacturing.

41:57.973 --> 42:00.684
You were simply the retail.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.520
Toodle-oo.

42:06.565 --> 42:09.109
And whatever you guys
are going through,

42:09.151 --> 42:11.820
you gotta kiss and make up.

42:11.862 --> 42:14.823

42:16.283 --> 42:17.493
[Tipping and Tina moaning]

42:17.535 --> 42:18.786
[Tipping] Oh, God!
Oh, God!

42:18.827 --> 42:19.870
[Tina] Feel good, baby?

42:19.912 --> 42:21.872
[Tipping] I feel--yes,
baby feels very good.

42:21.914 --> 42:25.417
[Tipping grunting]

42:25.459 --> 42:27.211
Hey, can you guys keep it down
in there, please?

42:27.253 --> 42:29.004
[Tipping] Yeah, yeah,
sure, bud.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.548
[moaning]

42:30.589 --> 42:32.591
My--my legs
are kind of getting wobbly.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.218
If you put one foot
up on the toilet,

42:34.260 --> 42:35.469
it usually works better.

42:35.511 --> 42:38.180
[Tipping] Oh, wow,
what are you doing to me?

42:38.222 --> 42:39.390
[Tina] Want me to stop, Arthur?

42:39.431 --> 42:41.308
[Tipping] No, no, no.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.060
There you go.
That's better, right?

42:43.102 --> 42:44.687
I guess.
I'm a little distracted,

42:44.728 --> 42:45.646
but I'm fine.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.731
You get used
to these close quarters.

42:47.773 --> 42:50.276
- You've done this before?
- Yeah, dozens of times.

42:50.317 --> 42:51.277
Oh.

42:51.318 --> 42:52.903
[Tipping]
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.154
Okay, I gotta stop.
I'm sorry.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.531
This is getting
a little weird.

42:55.573 --> 42:58.576
- [Tipping groans]
- Really?

42:58.617 --> 42:59.702
- [heavy thud]

42:59.743 --> 43:02.246
What the hell?
What's going on in there?

43:02.288 --> 43:03.747
I think he's dead.

43:03.789 --> 43:06.750
My vagina killed him.

43:06.792 --> 43:08.085
Whoa.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.380
Fuck, Arthur.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.382
[cell phone chimes]

43:13.424 --> 43:14.592
[sighs] Shit.

43:14.633 --> 43:17.553
Another mom said her kid
can't come to the party.

43:17.595 --> 43:22.016
It might have something to do
with your ankle bracelet, babe.

43:22.057 --> 43:23.517
Well, whatever.
That's too bad.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.935
We don't need
Franny's school friends.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.186
We'll still have fun.

43:26.228 --> 43:28.314
Okay, everybody grab
your song lyrics.

43:28.355 --> 43:31.025
It's time to sing
the princess song.

43:31.066 --> 43:33.193

43:33.235 --> 43:36.071
Sit right here.

You can be a princess

43:47.458 --> 43:50.044
We can all be princesses

43:50.085 --> 43:52.171
In a fairy tale

43:52.212 --> 43:54.590
Sing and dance
and twirl around

43:54.632 --> 43:57.092
Spinning
in a ballroom gown

43:57.134 --> 43:59.428
We can all
be princesses

43:59.470 --> 44:01.555
In a fairy tale

44:01.597 --> 44:04.516
Ho, ho, ho!
Happy birthday, Franny.

44:04.558 --> 44:07.061
Look what I bought you.
These are from me, okay?

44:07.102 --> 44:08.562
Only me, your favorite uncle.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.689
- Yay, guns!
- Guns!

44:11.607 --> 44:13.275
[Debbie] That is not
a princess gift.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.277
- Tough titties.
- Let's play!

44:15.319 --> 44:16.820
You got it, kid.

44:16.862 --> 44:18.364
[TV]   The boys

44:18.405 --> 44:19.406
[Mickey] Okay, shoot!

44:19.448 --> 44:21.533
- No, no, Uncle Mickey!
- Sorry, Debs.

44:21.575 --> 44:22.910
- [Mickey] No, no, go ahead,
go ahead, shoot me--

44:22.951 --> 44:23.952
[Franny]
I'm gonna get you!

44:23.994 --> 44:25.287
[Mickey] Blow my brains out,
kid. Come on.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.455
- [Franny] Okay, okay.
- [Mickey] Go ahead.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.123
[Franny] I got you,
you're dead! I shot you!

44:28.165 --> 44:30.125
- [medic] Yeah.
- [medic] Watch your step.

44:30.167 --> 44:31.752
Oh, shit.

44:31.794 --> 44:35.089
I'm really sorry again, sir,
that you had a heart attack.

44:35.130 --> 44:37.716
You know,
I somehow feel responsible.

44:37.758 --> 44:41.220
Maybe you shouldn't had
all those pitchers of beer.

44:42.596 --> 44:46.058
Well, back at it again
in the morning, right, sir?

44:46.100 --> 44:47.935
[heart monitor speeds up]

44:47.976 --> 44:49.603
Or maybe not.

44:49.645 --> 44:53.357
rock music

44:53.399 --> 44:55.150
[engine turns over]

44:56.568 --> 44:59.530
[siren wailing]

45:02.324 --> 45:04.410
[Tami] Oh, God.

45:04.451 --> 45:05.911
I ate too much cake.

45:05.953 --> 45:08.747
Oh, yeah, I didn't go anywhere
near that pink frosting shit.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.290
[laughs]

45:10.332 --> 45:12.251
Hey, what kind of party
you think Fred's gonna want

45:12.292 --> 45:13.377
when he's older?

45:13.419 --> 45:14.670
A Terminator party.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.255
[laughs] Why?
Is that what you wanted

45:16.296 --> 45:17.589
when you were a kid?

45:17.631 --> 45:19.633
- Yeah?
- Maybe.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.510
Hey!
Yo, hey, whoa!

45:21.552 --> 45:24.012
[Tami] Whoa, what the hell?

45:24.054 --> 45:25.389
[Lip]
Marsha?

45:25.431 --> 45:27.558
Lip.

45:27.599 --> 45:30.811
What, you fucked up
our house before?

45:30.853 --> 45:33.188
The three of us.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.148
Why?

45:34.189 --> 45:36.275
You're making your house
look too good.

45:36.316 --> 45:37.484
So?

45:37.526 --> 45:39.445
Our property tax will go up.

45:39.486 --> 45:41.447
What, because we planted
a couple flowers?

45:41.488 --> 45:44.032
And put in new windows
and mulch,

45:44.074 --> 45:45.284
cleaned up the trash.

45:45.325 --> 45:47.703
People are gonna wanna do
the same as you.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.747
White folk will drive
around the city

45:49.788 --> 45:51.749
looking for a new place
to live,

45:51.790 --> 45:54.376
never imagine themselves
down here.

45:54.418 --> 45:57.963
Then they see your house,
call the realtors.

45:58.005 --> 45:59.840
Rent will go up.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.425
Property tax.

46:01.467 --> 46:03.343
We've been here
our whole lives,

46:03.385 --> 46:05.637
and now we're being pushed out.

46:05.679 --> 46:07.431
Where will we go then?

46:07.473 --> 46:11.185
[siren wailing faintly]

46:11.226 --> 46:14.605
[sighs]

46:16.064 --> 46:18.066
Franny did not like her party.

46:18.108 --> 46:20.611
Yeah, not so much.

46:23.071 --> 46:25.199
You were right.
I mean...

46:25.240 --> 46:27.493
I only did this for myself.

46:27.534 --> 46:30.496
I just--I always dreamed
of having a princess party

46:30.537 --> 46:32.873
as a kid.

46:32.915 --> 46:35.000
I'm sorry, babes.

46:42.508 --> 46:46.386
Not that I would do it
differently or anything.

46:46.428 --> 46:47.763
Really?

46:47.805 --> 46:49.973
I mean, fuck no.
It's like,

46:50.015 --> 46:51.391
Franny's only five.

46:51.433 --> 46:52.601
It's not like
she's gonna remember

46:52.643 --> 46:53.936
any of this shit.

46:53.977 --> 46:57.105
Even if she does,
a little bit of disappointment

46:57.147 --> 46:58.899
is good for her.

46:58.941 --> 47:02.486
I mean, I would do anything
for that kid, but...

47:02.528 --> 47:04.696
sometimes I just...

47:04.738 --> 47:07.115
it's gotta be about me.

47:11.286 --> 47:13.705
[chuckles]

47:16.041 --> 47:19.670
[siren wailing]

47:19.711 --> 47:21.839
Wow, it gets sketchy here
at night.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.383
Yeah, we should probably
go home.

47:24.424 --> 47:25.592
She's down there.
Come on.

47:25.634 --> 47:27.469
- You sure about this?
- Fuck Frank.

47:27.511 --> 47:29.346
Why should we give him
2/3 of our money?

47:29.388 --> 47:30.430
'Cause he's our partner.

47:30.472 --> 47:31.807
[Veronica]
We can do everything he did.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.518
[Kev] I'm not sure I can make
those pineapple lollipops.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.186
Go, ask.

47:36.228 --> 47:37.729
[sighs]

47:37.771 --> 47:40.315
Hey, um, how you doing?

47:40.357 --> 47:43.193
We're looking
to, um, buy some weed--

47:43.235 --> 47:45.612
ganja, smoke, marijuana.

47:45.654 --> 47:47.239
- [Veronica] Kev...
- I know you?

47:47.281 --> 47:48.657
- [Kev] No.
- Yeah, you do.

47:48.699 --> 47:49.950
Our friend was here earlier.

47:49.992 --> 47:53.161
I should say our partner.
Frank Gallagher?

47:53.203 --> 47:54.997
Sorry, I don't got nothing.

47:55.038 --> 47:56.623
What, seriously?

47:56.665 --> 47:58.333
You know anyone else
who's selling?

47:58.375 --> 47:59.626
Nope.

47:59.668 --> 48:00.836
Come on,
how's that possible?

48:00.878 --> 48:03.255
That's because I bought it all
from her...

48:03.297 --> 48:04.673
dramatic music

48:04.715 --> 48:08.093
...with my earnings from today.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.303
[laughs]

48:09.344 --> 48:10.721
- Hey, Frank!
- Hey.

48:10.762 --> 48:14.141
I wanted to get a jump start
on tomorrow's work.

48:14.182 --> 48:15.767
Little did I know my partners

48:15.809 --> 48:18.729
would be going behind my back.

48:18.770 --> 48:22.608
Just for the record,
I was hesitant about this.

48:22.649 --> 48:24.401
I think from now on,

48:24.443 --> 48:27.029
our cut's gonna be 70/30.

48:30.198 --> 48:31.491
I'm the 70.

48:37.331 --> 48:40.500
[Ian exhales heavily]

48:40.542 --> 48:42.669
Guess the interview
didn't go so good?

48:42.711 --> 48:45.464
Nah.
I don't do normal.

48:45.505 --> 48:46.924
It's boring as fuck, man.

48:46.965 --> 48:49.426
I don't want to end up
a monkey like you anyway.

48:49.468 --> 48:51.303
Just trying to be
a mature adult.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.471
That's all.

48:52.512 --> 48:53.555
Well...

48:53.597 --> 48:56.850
I, uh, like doing things
my way.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.102
So we gonna fuck, or what?

48:59.144 --> 49:00.479
Nope.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.564
You didn't get a real job.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.317
Fine by me, man.
See if I care.

49:05.359 --> 49:06.860
In fact,

49:06.902 --> 49:10.489
I might just jerk off
with all my money.

49:10.530 --> 49:12.991
Yeah.
Come here, guys.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.701
Mm...

49:14.743 --> 49:18.288
Mm, mm, yeah.

49:18.330 --> 49:20.040
Ooh, yeah, come here.

49:20.082 --> 49:23.085
Suck that dick,
Benjamin Franklin.

49:23.126 --> 49:24.544
Come on now.

49:24.586 --> 49:27.506
Got a little three-way with--
whoever the fuck that is.

49:27.547 --> 49:30.467
Mm, mm.
Yeah, you like that?

49:30.509 --> 49:32.719
What if we, uh, add--

49:32.761 --> 49:34.346
hey, fuck off,
George Washington,

49:34.388 --> 49:37.182
cheap-ass motherfucker.

49:38.725 --> 49:40.060
rock music

49:40.102 --> 49:42.270
Oh, I like that.

49:42.312 --> 49:44.147
Uh-huh, keep going.

49:44.189 --> 49:47.985
God, money really does
buy happiness, huh?

49:48.026 --> 49:51.905
Lying in my coffin instead

49:51.947 --> 49:55.617
The way I feel,
I'd rather be dead

49:55.659 --> 49:58.537
Sucking on some cherry
so red

49:58.578 --> 50:00.038
We really have to do this?

50:00.080 --> 50:03.166
Yes, we have to maintain
a negative curb appeal.

50:03.208 --> 50:04.668
But I love our house.

50:04.710 --> 50:05.919
Hey, me too.
I wanna stay in it

50:05.961 --> 50:07.838
with you and Fred forever.

50:11.508 --> 50:14.469
It's the pits,
it's the pits

50:15.762 --> 50:18.181
Well,

50:18.223 --> 50:20.350
what do you think?

50:20.392 --> 50:21.852
Nice.

50:21.893 --> 50:23.729
How about mine?

50:23.770 --> 50:25.689
Wow.

50:25.731 --> 50:26.940
That's perfect.
You did good

50:26.982 --> 50:27.983
for the neighborhood, babe.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.609
Anything to help our family.

50:29.651 --> 50:31.695
Even a giant squirting penis.

50:31.737 --> 50:34.239
Exactly.
[laughs]

50:34.281 --> 50:35.240
Muah.

50:35.282 --> 50:38.035
Faded like the night
in the sky

50:38.076 --> 50:42.164
Waving at the neighbors
bye bye

50:42.205 --> 50:45.834
It's the pits,
it's the pits

50:45.876 --> 50:48.336
Don't look down
you stepped on shit
