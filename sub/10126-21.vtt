WAIT. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.700
YOU'RE A JUNIOR
IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.100
YOU HAVE NO GOALS,
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.834
HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT COLLEGE?

00:35.834 --> 00:36.834
I'M GOING TO COLLEGE.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.200
OH, YOU ARE? WHERE?

00:38.200 --> 00:42.700
HAWAII. I FIGURE
I HAVE A BETTER SHOT
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.000
THE PEOPLE THAT CARE
ABOUT YOU IN THIS LIFE

00:45.000 --> 00:46.600
YOU CAN COUNT
ON ONE HAND,

00:46.600 --> 00:48.767
SO DON'T
BLOW ME OFF, OK?

00:48.767 --> 00:50.967
JOHN, I GOT PEOPLE
WHO CARE ABOUT ME.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.934
SHAWN, I THINK
MR. TURNER'S RIGHT.

00:52.934 --> 00:54.967
WE GOT ONE MORE YEAR
OF HIGH SCHOOL,

00:54.967 --> 00:57.667
AND THE HUMIDITY IN HAWAII
IS GONNA MAKE MY HAIR GO--

00:57.667 --> 00:59.400

00:59.400 --> 01:00.734
IT'S NOT GOOD.

01:00.734 --> 01:02.567
WELL, I WANT TO GO
TO PENN STATE.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.700
AND I WANT TO GO
WHERE SHE GOES.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.734

BY THAT?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.600

01:08.600 --> 01:11.734
TICK TOCK.

01:11.734 --> 01:12.800
AND YOU ARE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME

01:12.800 --> 01:13.934
TO FIGURE OUT
YOUR LIFE.

01:13.934 --> 01:16.400
HEY, JOHN, YOU'RE NOT
MY GUARDIAN ANYMORE.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.300
I'M BACK WITH MY PARENTS.
I'LL BE FINE.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.567
YEAH, SHAWN,

01:19.567 --> 01:21.000
BUT I'M ONE OF
THE HANDFUL OF PEOPLE

01:21.000 --> 01:23.100

01:23.100 --> 01:24.300
NOW, YOUR PARENTS

4 YEARS OF SECURITY
IN THESE HALLS,

01:58.500 --> 02:01.300
YOU THINK HE WAS
DOING A NUMBER ON ME?

02:01.300 --> 02:03.033
ONLY TOTALLY.

02:03.033 --> 02:07.367
I MEAN, ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT
ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE
CARE ABOUT YOU?

02:07.367 --> 02:09.567
I MUST HAVE 100 PEOPLE
WHO CARE ABOUT ME

02:09.567 --> 02:13.200
AND CARE ENOUGH ABOUT ME
NOT TO JUDGE ME LIKE THAT
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.100

KIND OF EMBARRASSING, HUH?

SOMEWHERE?

02:19.400 --> 02:23.400

EVERYBODY KNOWS MY NAME.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.600

OR REALLY CREEPY.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.033
YOU HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR.
I LIKE THAT.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.200
AND YET
YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.233
LAUGHTER IS A MASK

02:59.233 --> 03:01.900
WHICH DENIES THE REALITY
OF A SITUATION

03:01.900 --> 03:03.767
AND REVEALS NERVOUSNESS.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.000
HA HA HA.
THAT'S FUNNY.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.467
SO, WHAT'S UP
WITH THE MUSIC?

03:08.467 --> 03:10.300

WHAT?

03:10.300 --> 03:12.967

THAT KIND OF CLUB,

SO WHAT KIND OF CLUB
IS IT, THEN?

03:15.800 --> 03:19.100
IT'S MORE OF A...HANGOUT

03:19.100 --> 03:23.100

GET TOGETHER AND...

03:23.100 --> 03:24.600
TALK ABOUT STUFF.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.600
THEY'RE ALL

03:27.600 --> 03:31.233

ALWAYS USE MORE FRIENDS.

I'M REAL COMFORTABLE WITH
THE HUGGING THING, THOUGH.

IS A BURST OF PURE LOVE.

03:40.967 --> 03:43.033

ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT?

03:47.700 --> 03:49.600

04:01.567 --> 04:03.767
AND HOW ABOUT YOU, SHAWN?
ARE YOU CENTERED?

04:03.767 --> 04:06.367
NOPE. I'M TOTALLY
OFF-CENTER.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.600

PLENTY OF ROOM IN CASE

YOUR FAMILY,

IS THIS CENTRE

YOU'RE TALKING CRAZY.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.667
I MEAN, YOU WERE THERE
FOR WHAT, AN HOUR?

06:10.667 --> 06:12.000
THE LENGTH OF A JOURNEY

06:12.000 --> 06:14.567
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
ITS ULTIMATE VALUE, SHAWN.

06:17.467 --> 06:19.200
THAT'S NICE.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.567
CORY.

06:20.567 --> 06:23.700
SHAWN, LISTEN.
THROUGHOUT OUR
ENTIRE FRIENDSHIP,

06:23.700 --> 06:25.300
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

06:25.300 --> 06:27.400
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT GIRLS,
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MOVIES,

06:27.400 --> 06:31.133
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MUSIC,
BUT WE'VE NEVER TALKED
ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

06:31.133 --> 06:34.300
I BELIEVE THAT
I FINALLY FOUND A PLACE

06:34.300 --> 06:35.734
WHERE PEOPLE
LET ME BE WHO I AM

06:35.734 --> 06:37.667
WITHOUT TRYING
TO CHANGE ME

06:37.667 --> 06:40.300
OR, UH, NEED TO KNOW
WHAT MY GOALS ARE
IN LIFE.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.567
WHY DO I NEED THAT?

06:41.567 --> 06:43.834
SHAWN, WHAT DO YOU
BELIEVE IN?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.500
WHAT DO YOU
BELIEVE IN, CORY?

06:45.500 --> 06:47.400
DO YOU BELIEVE IN
A MOTHER AND A FATHER

06:47.400 --> 06:49.834
AND A COMFORTABLE HOUSE
AND A COMFORTABLE STREET

06:49.834 --> 06:51.300
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU HAVE?

06:51.300 --> 06:52.300
WELL, I DON'T
HAVE THAT,

06:52.300 --> 06:54.100
SO I FOUND SOMETHING
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.600
YEAH, BUT WHO ARE
THESE PEOPLE?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.900
STOP TRYING TO
TAKE AWAY WHAT I HAVE.
I DON'T DO THAT TO YOU.

06:58.900 --> 07:02.133
WE REALLY
HAVE TO BE GOING.

07:02.133 --> 07:04.300
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.133
THEN YOU SHOULD
CHECK IT OUT
SOMETIME, BUD.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.100
SO, SHAWN, WHAT...

07:13.100 --> 07:15.100
WHAT IS THIS CENTRE
YOU'RE HANGING OUT AT?

07:15.100 --> 07:17.500
NO.
WHY NOT?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.000
BECAUSE I AM NOT
GOING TO TALK TO YOU

07:19.000 --> 07:21.467
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO UNDERSTAND.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.500
OH, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT,
BUT SOMEHOW IT'S BEYOND ME?

07:23.500 --> 07:25.800
YOU'RE AS JUDGMENTAL AS
EVERYBODY ELSE IN MY LIFE.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.500
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU JUDGED ME, REMEMBER?

07:28.500 --> 07:30.200
YOU SAID I COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.800
I'M CENTERED, YOU'RE NOT.
END OF STORY.

07:32.800 --> 07:37.233
BOY, THIS SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL ENLIGHTENED,
OPEN-MINDED GROUP.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.000
JUDGING.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
OK. WHY DO YOU FEEL
YOU NEED TO BE A PART
OF THIS PLACE?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.400
OK.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.367
ALL MY LIFE,

07:49.367 --> 07:53.467
I HAVE
FELT LIKE THERE WAS
SOME PART OF ME MISSING,

07:53.467 --> 07:55.800
AND I FELT LIKE
EVERYBODY COULD TELL.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.800
YOU KNOW, LIKE THERE
WAS SOME HOLE IN ME,

07:57.800 --> 07:59.867
AND EVERYONE COULD
SEE THROUGH IT,

07:59.867 --> 08:02.967
LIKE I WASN'T FINISHED
OR SOMETHING.

08:02.967 --> 08:06.300
I NEVER SAW THAT, SHAWN.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.667
I MEAN, IF YOU
WOULD'VE JUST TOLD ME,

08:08.667 --> 08:10.300
I COULD'VE
DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.400
LET'S NOT DWELL
ON WHAT PEOPLE DID
OR DID NOT DO FOR ME.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.567
YES, SHAWN,
LET'S DWELL ON THAT.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.300
THAT'S WHAT
MAKES YOU A PERSON--

08:16.300 --> 08:18.767
HOW YOU RELATE TO THE PEOPLE
WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

08:18.767 --> 08:21.367
THE CENTRE
IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE
WHO CARE ABOUT ME

08:21.367 --> 08:22.867
AND WHO MAKE ME
FEEL LIKE A PERSON.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.133
THE CENTRE IS FILLED
WITH LOST SOULS

08:28.133 --> 08:30.000
WHO HAVE
NO BELIEF SYSTEM,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.967
WHO ARE TARGETS
FOR SOME GUY

08:31.967 --> 08:33.734
TO BRING OVER
TO HIS WAY OF THINKING.

08:35.367 --> 08:38.734
THE SHAWN HUNTER
THAT I KNOW...

08:38.734 --> 08:42.100
IS ONE OF THE MOST
UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS
I'VE EVER MET.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
AND IF YOU
LET THIS PLACE

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
TAKE AWAY WHO YOU
REALLY ARE, SHAWN,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.300
THEN YOU'VE MADE
THE WORST JUDGMENT
YOU COULD MAKE.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.133
YOU MADE
THE JUDGMENT.

08:57.133 --> 08:59.400
I DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM, JOHN.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.100
WELL, THIS IS IT, ERIC.
THIS IS THE CENTRE...

09:09.100 --> 09:11.033
WHERE SHAWN IS.

09:11.033 --> 09:14.300
CON MEN. FAKES
AND CHARLATANS,
I'D SAY.

09:14.300 --> 09:17.033
WHICH ONE OF YOU
BRAIN-WASHED NUTS
VALIDATES PARKING?

09:21.500 --> 09:22.834
ERIC, LISTEN.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.834
I WOULD NOT
UNDERESTIMATE
THESE PEOPLE, OK?

09:24.834 --> 09:26.300
I MEAN,
THEY DID GET SHAWN.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.000
CORY, NO OFFENSE
TO SHAWN OR ANYTHING, OK,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.600
BUT IT TAKES
A PRETTY WEAK-WILLED
AND GULLIBLE INDIVIDUAL

09:30.600 --> 09:32.700
TO SUCCUMB TO THIS KIND
OF BLATANT SCAM.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.100
HI. I'M ALICIA.
WELCOME TO THE CENTRE.

09:37.734 --> 09:39.800
HERE'S MY MONEY.
WHERE'S MY ROOM?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.200
UH, YES, HE HAS
HIS CONFLICTS,

09:41.200 --> 09:44.133
BUT WE'RE NOT STAYING.
WE'RE JUST HERE
FOR A VISIT.

09:44.133 --> 09:46.500
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE FEELING LOST,

09:46.500 --> 09:49.300
ALONE, ABANDONED.

09:49.300 --> 09:54.300
YES. MY EMOTIONAL PALATE
IS MISSING YELLOW AND BLUE.
WHERE'S MY ROOM?

09:56.400 --> 09:57.834
OH, ERIC.

09:57.834 --> 09:59.000
ERIC!

09:59.000 --> 10:02.467
NO, NO, NO. MY NEW NUT NAME
IS SUNFLOWER FORTUNATO.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.500
HELLO.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.100
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.800
WHAT, NO HUG?

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
CORY, THE CENTRE
ISN'T THE KIND OF PLACE

10:16.800 --> 10:19.100
FOR SOMEONE
LIKE YOU, OK?

10:19.100 --> 10:20.467
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO BELIEVE IN.
I'M STILL LOOKING.

10:20.467 --> 10:23.400
YOU SHOULD GO.
I BELONG HERE.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.567
SO THAT'S IT, HUH?
YOU'VE CHOSEN THE CENTRE.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.233
YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE HERE
WITH THESE JUJY-FRUITS.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.700
YOU CAN'T
SEE THROUGH THIS?

10:30.700 --> 10:33.000
CORY...

10:33.000 --> 10:34.600
I WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE HERE.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.133
AND THE BEAUTY PART IS,
DURING THE WINTER,

10:36.133 --> 10:39.500
I CAN GO TO THEIR TANNING
AND HUGGING CENTRE
IN THE BAHAMAS.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.834
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, SHAWN--

10:41.834 --> 10:43.500
CORY, CORY,
LEAVE ME ALONE, OK?

10:43.500 --> 10:44.834
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M DOING DRUGS.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.100
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU'RE DOING DRUGS, OK?

10:47.100 --> 10:49.233
I MEAN, YOU'RE HAVING
YOUR MIND MESSED WITH,

10:49.233 --> 10:50.500
YOU'RE NOT
THE PERSON I KNOW,

10:50.500 --> 10:52.367
AND EVERYTHING YOU SAY
IS ARTIFICIAL.

10:52.367 --> 10:55.033
OK, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO FIND WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR HERE.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.300
16 YEARS
OF BEING OUT THERE,

10:56.300 --> 10:57.900
I HAVEN'T FOUND
ANYTHING AT ALL.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.233
THIS GUY MR. MACK
CAN'T HELP YOU FIND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

11:00.233 --> 11:03.200
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,
ALL RIGHT?

11:03.200 --> 11:04.367
YOU'RE 16 YEARS OLD.

11:04.367 --> 11:06.133
THAT'S WHAT
THIS GUY DOES.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.100
HE MAKES YOU
THINK YOU'RE LOST
SO HE CAN FIND YOU,

11:08.100 --> 11:11.200
AND ONCE HE HAS YOU,
HE WILL NEVER LET YOU
OUT OF HIS SIGHT, OK?

11:11.200 --> 11:13.200
HE WILL BE THERE
EVERY TIME
YOU TURN AROUND.

11:15.767 --> 11:17.100
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

11:19.367 --> 11:20.400
HELLO.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.800
WELCOME TO THE CENTRE.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.567
OK, HE'S VERY POWERFUL.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.867
WHO DO I MAKE THE CHECK
OUT TO?

11:26.867 --> 11:29.800
YOU'RE HERE TO SEE
THAT YOUR FRIEND SHAWN

11:29.800 --> 11:33.000
IS MAKING THE RIGHT
CHOICE FOR HIMSELF,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.033
SO CHECK US OUT.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.967
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
LIKE WHAT YOU SEE.

11:37.967 --> 11:41.834
NOBODY
JUDGES WHO YOU ARE
OR WHERE YOU COME FROM.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.567
EVERYONE HERE
IS THE SAME.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.000
CAN I GO
IN THAT ROOM?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.600
NO. THAT'S
THE CELEBRITY ROOM.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.567
OHH, THAT IS
THE SLICKEST GUY
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

11:54.567 --> 11:57.500
SO YOU SEE, CORY?
I'M NOT A PRISONER HERE.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.467
I CAN LEAVE
ANY TIME I WANT.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.133
OK, THEN I THINK
WE SHOULD GO NOW.

12:01.133 --> 12:03.100
I THINK WE SHOULD
LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.367
CHILDREN OF THE CENTRE,

12:06.367 --> 12:09.200
LET'S WELCOME
INTO OUR FAMILY

12:09.200 --> 12:11.800
OUR NEW LIFE MEMBER...

12:11.800 --> 12:12.800
SHAWN HUNTER.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.500
GOOD-BYE.

12:28.033 --> 12:29.800
YOU KNOW, GUYS,
I'M HIS BEST FRIEND,

12:29.800 --> 12:32.467
AND IT'S LIKE
HE DOESN'T
HEAR ME ANYMORE.

12:32.467 --> 12:35.033
OK. WHY DOES HE
HAVE SO MUCH FAITH
IN THIS CENTRE?

12:35.033 --> 12:37.100
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
IN THE CAR, GO DOWN,

12:37.100 --> 12:38.567
AND DRAG HIM OUT
OURSELVES.

12:38.567 --> 12:39.567
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

12:39.567 --> 12:40.967
I'M WELL-ACQUAINTED
WITH THE CENTRE.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.300
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CLOSE IT DOWN
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.767
THIS MR. MACK IS
A FRIGHTENING MAN.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.500
HELLO, MR. FEENY. CORY.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.967
MR. AND MRS. MATTHEWS.

12:49.967 --> 12:51.867
HELLO, SHAWN.

12:51.867 --> 12:53.834
SHAWN, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

12:53.834 --> 12:55.934
OF COURSE I AM.
I'M TOTALLY CENTERED.

12:55.934 --> 12:58.734
THANKS, ERIC,
FOR BRINGING HIM BACK.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.367
ACTUALLY,
I BROUGHT ERIC BACK.

13:02.133 --> 13:04.233
MR. MACK THOUGHT
ERIC WASN'T SINCERE,

13:04.233 --> 13:06.600
THAT HE WAS JUST
IN IT FOR THE HUGS.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.133
WELL, YEAH.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.600
OK. EVERYONE HAVE
A PEACEFUL NIGHT.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.934
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE CENTRE.

13:12.934 --> 13:14.800
OH, NO. WHOA, WHOA.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.567
WHILE YOUR PARENTS
ARE OUT OF TOWN,

13:16.567 --> 13:18.133
YOU ARE
OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

13:18.133 --> 13:21.000
THAT MEANS
YOU'RE STAYING HERE
IN THIS HOUSE.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.400
YEAH. MR. MACK TOLD ME
THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU

13:24.400 --> 13:26.000
WOULD TRY TO TALK ME
OUT OF MY BELIEFS.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.767
SHAWN, WE LOVE YOU.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.300
HE SAID YOU'D SAY THAT.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.667
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.734
GET HIM IN THE HOUSE
AND TIE HIM UP.

13:33.734 --> 13:36.900
SHAWN,
THESE AREN'T BELIEFS.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.467
THIS IS JUST A WAY
TO ESCAPE A LIFE

13:39.467 --> 13:40.800
THAT DOESN'T
HAVE BELIEFS.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.934
THAT'S A JUDGMENT.

13:41.934 --> 13:43.900
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
IT IS.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.100
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING
TO BELIEVE IN?

13:46.100 --> 13:47.300
LOOK, SHAWN,

13:47.300 --> 13:51.567
I'M ALL FOR YOUR SEARCH
FOR SPIRITUALITY, OK?

13:51.567 --> 13:53.567
BUT YOU DON'T
SEEM TO REALIZE

13:53.567 --> 13:56.567
THAT MR. MACK
IS CONDUCTING
HIS OWN SEARCH...

13:56.567 --> 14:01.567
FOR LOST SOULS
THAT HE CAN INFLUENCE
AND MANIPULATE.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.200
HE SAID
YOU'D SAY THAT.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.033
YES. I'M SURE HE HAS
GIVEN YOU A THOUGHT
FOR EVERY OCCASION.

14:07.033 --> 14:08.600
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

14:08.600 --> 14:10.100
EXCUSE ME.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.200
LOOK, SHAWN, I DON'T
SAY THIS VERY OFTEN,
BUT...

14:13.200 --> 14:16.100
FEENY'S MAKING SENSE.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.400
NOT TO ME.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.033
WHY WOULD FEENY FEEL
THE NEED TO ATTACK
WHAT I BELIEVE IN?

14:20.033 --> 14:22.000
SHAWN, WHY DO YOU

14:22.000 --> 14:24.300
NEED TO BELIEVE IN
THE CENTRE SO STRONGLY?

14:24.300 --> 14:25.934
WHAT?

14:25.934 --> 14:29.867
SHAWN, BEFORE YOU
MET THESE PEOPLE
AT THIS PLACE,

14:29.867 --> 14:32.100
WHAT DID YOU
BELIEVE IN?

14:32.100 --> 14:35.400
I DON'T KNOW.
NOTHING.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.100
DID YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?

14:42.300 --> 14:43.500
GEORGE, WHAT IS IT?

14:43.500 --> 14:45.800
UH, JONATHAN TURNER--

14:45.800 --> 14:48.233
HE'S BEEN IN
A MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT.

14:48.233 --> 14:49.800
OH, NO.

14:49.800 --> 14:50.900
IS HE OK?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.467
UH, NO, HE ISN'T.

14:52.467 --> 14:56.100

GIVE ME A LIFT
DOWN TO THE HOSPITAL?

THE DOCTORS ARE WITH HIM.
WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.300

15:18.300 --> 15:20.300
I HAVE NO CLUE.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.200
WELL, MR. TURNER AND SHAWN
ARE LIKE BROTHERS.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.500
HOW COULD HE NOT BE HERE?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.300
I DON'T KNOW.

BELONG HERE.

15:42.133 --> 15:44.033

INVITED ME,

15:44.033 --> 15:45.500
AND AS ALWAYS,

DOING HERE?

FACE THIS ALONE.

OK. FIRST OF ALL,
WE'RE HERE.

15:56.934 --> 15:59.300
OK. AND SECOND OF ALL,
I AM BEGINNING TO SEE

15:59.300 --> 16:01.567
THAT YOU ARE MORE ALONE
THAN I EVER KNEW.

16:01.567 --> 16:03.767
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:03.767 --> 16:07.600
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I FORGIVE YOU

16:07.600 --> 16:09.000
FOR TRYING
TO SHUT US DOWN.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.033

16:14.033 --> 16:15.400
WHOA. EASY, GEORGE.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.467

TRYING TO GET A RISE
OUT OF YOU.

NOT DEALING WITH

SHAWN DOWN. THANKS.

WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAKE A HIKE
BACK TO CONLAND?

16:27.100 --> 16:29.300
NOW, DO YOU SEE
HOW JUDGMENTAL THESE--

16:29.300 --> 16:30.800
NO, NO. LISTEN.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.967
YOU SEE. THE JUDGMENT
I MADE A LONG TIME AGO

16:34.967 --> 16:39.500
IS THAT SHAWN HUNTER
IS THE BEST FRIEND
THAT MY KID EVER HAD,

16:39.500 --> 16:45.800
AND I WILL KILL
TO PROTECT SHAWN HUNTER
FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.600
ALAN, HE WOULD
LOVE A LAWSUIT.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.567
I THINK THERE'S
A LOT OF ANGER HERE,

16:55.567 --> 16:57.400
AND I DON'T FEEL

16:57.400 --> 17:00.066
THAT THIS IS A HEALTHY
ENVIRONMENT FOR SHAWN.

17:00.066 --> 17:01.467
WELL, I REALLY DON'T--

17:01.467 --> 17:03.900
I KNOW YOU DON'T
RESPECT MY PHILOSOPHY,

17:03.900 --> 17:05.500
BUT FOR KIDS
WHO FEEL LOST

17:05.500 --> 17:08.600
AND HAVE AN EMPTINESS
IN THEIR LIVES,
I'M HERE...

17:08.600 --> 17:11.367
TO GIVE THEM
A SENSE OF BELONGING.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.500
YOU CAN'T HAVE SHAWN.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.500
THAT'S UP TO SHAWN.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.500
AND IN ANY EVENT,

17:18.500 --> 17:20.800
THERE ARE MANY MORE

REALLY HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW.

HELP YOU WITH THIS.

THE MATTER WITH YOU?

CORY, LET ME GO.
SHAWN, THIS IS A HUG, OK?
THIS IS A HUG,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.367
AND THIS IS
WHEN YOU HUG SOMEBODY,
WHEN YOU CARE ABOUT THEM

17:55.367 --> 17:58.233
AND THAT YOU WANT THEM
TO KNOW THAT.

17:58.233 --> 18:00.300
NOW YOU CANNOT LEAVE HERE.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

HE LOVES YOU,

18:02.734 --> 18:04.133
AND YOU LOVE HIM.

18:04.133 --> 18:06.200
IS THAT REAL?

18:06.200 --> 18:09.000
OR ARE MR. MACK
AND THE CENTRE REAL?

18:09.000 --> 18:13.200
YOU DECIDE,
BUT YOU CANNOT GO.

BE IN HERE?

18:33.867 --> 18:37.367
HOW COULD YOU
SCREW UP ON YOUR BIKE?

18:37.367 --> 18:41.400
I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU
SCREW UP ON ANYTHING.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.967
I'M THE SCREW-UP,
REMEMBER?

18:43.967 --> 18:46.700
COME ON, YOU REMEMBER.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.700
DON'T DO THIS
TO ME, JOHN.

REAL GOOD.

YOU'RE IN THERE,

YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE.

I WAS AT THE CENTRE...

19:18.400 --> 19:21.934
IT WAS ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU TAUGHT ME

19:21.934 --> 19:27.200
THAT MADE ME WONDER IF
IT WAS THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR ME OR NOT.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.800

TEACH ME ENOUGH--

YELLING AT ME YET.

19:56.700 --> 20:01.567
GOD, YOU'RE NOT TALKING,
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE HERE,

20:01.567 --> 20:04.867
SO I'M GOING TO TALK,

20:04.867 --> 20:06.967
AND YOU CAN LISTEN.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.400
GOD...

20:13.467 --> 20:16.200
I DON'T WANT TO BE
EMPTY INSIDE ANYMORE.

20:44.367 --> 20:45.600
HOW IS HE?

20:45.600 --> 20:47.367
HE'S GOING
TO BE FINE.

20:47.367 --> 20:49.233
REALLY? IS THAT
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID?

20:49.233 --> 20:51.033
NO. I JUST KNOW
HE IS.

20:51.033 --> 20:53.834
SHAWN, IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN
A VERY STRESSFUL DAY FOR YOU,

20:53.834 --> 20:55.667
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD
COME BACK TO THE CENTRE.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.500
YEAH, I THINK
I SHOULD, TOO.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.567
WHAT?

20:58.567 --> 21:00.667
I WANT TO PICK UP
MY THINGS,

21:00.667 --> 21:02.200
AND THEN,
IF IT'S OK,

21:02.200 --> 21:03.600
COME BACK AND STAY
WITH YOU GUYS.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.467
YEAH, IT'S OK.

21:05.467 --> 21:06.867
SHAWN--

21:06.867 --> 21:09.367
YOU KNOW, I SEE YOU
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,

21:09.367 --> 21:11.800
AND I HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY,
AND IT'S NOTHING.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.734
AND IF I WAS
AN EMPTY PERSON

21:13.734 --> 21:15.400
WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO BELIEVE IN,

21:15.400 --> 21:19.300
I MIGHT GO WITH YOU
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE
EASY.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.900
WELL, I'M DONE
WITH EASY,

21:20.900 --> 21:23.000
AND I'M DONE WITH EMPTY.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.800
I'M DONE WITH YOU.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.500
WELL...

21:27.500 --> 21:30.400
WE'LL ALWAYS BE THERE
FOR YOU, SHAWN.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.900
YEAH.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.200
I KNOW.
