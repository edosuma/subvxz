00:04.849 --> 00:06.517
NADINE: <i>The framework for the next phase</i>

00:06.518 --> 00:07.685
of the talks is in place.

00:07.686 --> 00:09.253
The Iranians have signed off on Vienna.

00:09.254 --> 00:10.488
Though not on the venue.

00:10.489 --> 00:12.323
- We just need to finalize the schedule.
- And the venue.

00:12.324 --> 00:14.125
Schedule determines available venues.

00:14.126 --> 00:15.660
We'll get into it, sir.

00:15.661 --> 00:18.730
If it were up to me, I
would lock the Iranians in

00:18.731 --> 00:22.100
the back room of a clam
bar until we had a deal.

00:22.101 --> 00:26.337
It might have to be a Wiener
Schnitzel bar in Vienna, sir.

00:26.338 --> 00:28.471
All right. Thanks, everybody.

00:32.476 --> 00:34.645
- Uh, Matt...
- Yeah?

00:34.646 --> 00:36.214
how's that speech coming along?

00:36.215 --> 00:38.282
I'll have a draft for you
by the time you land.

00:38.283 --> 00:39.784
Good.

00:39.785 --> 00:41.119
Sir...

00:41.120 --> 00:43.087
the policy stances you asked for

00:43.088 --> 00:45.723
are very much at odds
with the administration.

00:45.724 --> 00:47.291
(wry laugh) Again?

00:47.292 --> 00:48.292
(quiet laugh)

00:48.293 --> 00:49.794
I can soften them.

00:49.795 --> 00:51.062
Nah.

00:51.063 --> 00:52.830
I want a clear, bold vision.

00:52.831 --> 00:54.632
Yes, sir.

00:54.633 --> 00:56.100
Oh, and Matt...

00:56.101 --> 00:58.603
you know I count on your discretion.

00:58.604 --> 01:00.605
Of course.

01:00.606 --> 01:02.740
Yes.

01:02.741 --> 01:05.275
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

01:05.277 --> 01:06.744
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

01:06.745 --> 01:07.979
And you're bad at it.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.147
Look, if I were lying,

01:09.148 --> 01:10.782
which I am not, you would never know.

01:10.783 --> 01:12.817
So the secretary just
wanted to shoot the breeze?

01:12.818 --> 01:14.619
- We have a rapport.
- Oh, please.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.255
You know, you're just... you're
just jealous that the big guy is

01:17.256 --> 01:18.589
taking an interest in me.

01:18.590 --> 01:21.526
Wait, that man would eat
his young for a leg up.

01:21.527 --> 01:24.361
You're mistaking cozy for something else.

01:27.765 --> 01:29.333
You wanted to see me, Mr. Secretary?

01:29.334 --> 01:31.735
Yes. Come in.

01:39.777 --> 01:41.446
I am sorry,

01:41.447 --> 01:43.513
but I have to cancel our weekend.

01:45.383 --> 01:46.751
Is it your wife?

01:46.752 --> 01:49.654
No, it's personal business.

01:49.655 --> 01:51.322
Can I ask what?

01:51.323 --> 01:52.690
You can ask me anything.

01:52.691 --> 01:55.393
It's an estate matter

01:55.394 --> 01:58.496
relating to my family's old
cattle ranch outside Caracas.

01:58.497 --> 02:01.698
I... I need to handle it personally.

02:04.235 --> 02:06.636
Okay, then.

02:07.805 --> 02:09.839
When I get back...

02:12.310 --> 02:14.812
I'll make it up to you.

02:14.813 --> 02:17.213
You better.

02:19.383 --> 02:21.718
(chuckles)

02:24.722 --> 02:26.324
You're good to go, Mr. Secretary.

02:26.325 --> 02:28.025
Thanks, Fred.

02:28.026 --> 02:30.261
Mike and Tony'll have your
back while you're down there.

02:30.262 --> 02:31.496
If they can keep up.

02:31.497 --> 02:34.398
Hope you boys like riding horses.

02:34.399 --> 02:36.167
(both chuckle)

02:36.168 --> 02:39.269
- Happy trails, sir.
- Thanks.

02:48.212 --> 02:51.649
(sudden bang, rattling)

02:51.650 --> 02:54.050
Oh, great.

02:55.820 --> 02:58.689
(banging, rumbling)

02:58.690 --> 03:00.390
Pretty rough, huh?

03:09.133 --> 03:11.568
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

03:18.910 --> 03:20.645
We have hit severe C.A.T.

03:20.646 --> 03:23.648
I think the stub trim's
broken completely.

03:23.649 --> 03:25.049
What the hell is going on?

03:25.050 --> 03:26.951
I've lost pitch control.

03:26.952 --> 03:28.586
Can you get it back?

03:28.587 --> 03:30.321
The stabilizer's failed completely.

03:30.322 --> 03:32.756
I cannot keep us in the air.

03:36.294 --> 03:37.795
So it goes.

03:37.796 --> 03:39.997
All right, trying to push and roll,

03:39.998 --> 03:41.666
(over speaker): <i>losing altitude fast.</i>

03:41.667 --> 03:43.434
<i>No, no, no, no, no...</i>

03:43.435 --> 03:45.069
(static, cuts off)

03:45.070 --> 03:47.338
Play back that last part.

03:47.339 --> 03:48.739
Yeah.

03:48.740 --> 03:50.807
PILOT: ...keep us in the air.

03:52.944 --> 03:55.346
VINCENT: So it goes.

03:55.347 --> 03:57.315
- "So it goes," huh?
- He's pretty calm

03:57.316 --> 03:59.150
for a guy who thinks he's about to die.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.452
The NTSB didn't find the
comment remarkable.

04:01.453 --> 04:02.820
Well, they didn't have reason to.

04:02.821 --> 04:05.433
I once had a wing drop that sent
me into an uncontrolled roll

04:05.434 --> 04:07.428
at 1,000 feet... I didn't
know if I had room to bail.

04:07.429 --> 04:09.994
Whoa, you never told me this.

04:09.995 --> 04:12.763
Well, I... the point is, uh,

04:12.764 --> 04:14.599
everything slowed. All I felt was calm.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.867
Okay, Iceman, but you were a pilot

04:16.868 --> 04:18.469
and Marsh doesn't exactly

04:18.470 --> 04:20.438
sound calm to me... more
like he isn't surprised.

04:20.439 --> 04:22.640
You know, like he crossed someone

04:22.641 --> 04:24.408
and is expecting payback.

04:24.409 --> 04:26.477
You've seen too many
spy movies, Isabelle.

04:26.478 --> 04:27.678
And lived a few.

04:27.679 --> 04:28.946
What about you, babe?

04:28.947 --> 04:30.381
Does this... does he sound like a guy

04:30.382 --> 04:31.649
who suspected foul play?

04:31.650 --> 04:33.517
Well, George thought it was. I...

04:33.518 --> 04:35.286
Two months after
Marsh's plane went down,

04:35.287 --> 04:38.222
George stood right over there and said

04:38.223 --> 04:40.324
that crash wasn't an accident...

04:40.325 --> 04:41.859
and that somebody in the CIA

04:41.860 --> 04:44.328
- was behind it.
- No matter how wigged out George was,

04:44.329 --> 04:45.663
he was a damn good analyst.

04:45.664 --> 04:48.633
Three days later, George
dies in a car crash

04:48.634 --> 04:50.701
that anybody with basic tradecraft skills

04:50.702 --> 04:52.637
could have made look like an accident.

04:52.638 --> 04:53.804
It reeks of foul play.

04:53.805 --> 04:57.274
And yet here's this
2,000-page NTSB report

04:57.275 --> 05:00.711
that concludes Vincent Marsh's
plane crash was an accident.

05:00.712 --> 05:04.581
Well, we owe it to George to see
if we can prove it wrong. Gimme.

05:05.983 --> 05:07.585
Okay...

05:07.586 --> 05:10.921
The NTSB's conclusion seems irrefutable.

05:10.922 --> 05:12.556
The R-47 jackscrew

05:12.557 --> 05:13.991
in the tail assembly failed,

05:13.992 --> 05:17.528
taking out the horizontal
stabilizers, resulting in

05:17.529 --> 05:19.530
an unrecoverable dive.

05:19.531 --> 05:21.499
A broken screw? Seriously?

05:21.500 --> 05:22.833
Well, the R-47

05:22.834 --> 05:24.068
is more like a-a rod.

05:24.069 --> 05:25.169
It's about an inch in diameter.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.438
Says it was rated for ten years.

05:27.439 --> 05:29.840
Was at eight and a half
at the time of the crash.

05:29.841 --> 05:32.043
It's not crazy that it
would fail a little early.

05:32.044 --> 05:35.279
Well, the C-600 jet has a
pretty great safety record.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.249
Only one crash in the
past 15 years, in Dubai.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.017
Wait a minute... I remember that.

05:40.018 --> 05:42.453
I was on the Middle
East desk at the time.

05:42.454 --> 05:45.122
Uh, some... Iranian scientist died?

05:45.123 --> 05:46.857
Yeah, their top nuclear physicist.

05:46.858 --> 05:49.694
Right. There was speculation
that Mossad was behind that.

05:49.695 --> 05:52.229
It was also stabilizer failure.

05:52.230 --> 05:54.198
- The R-47 jackscrew.
- Is that a coincidence?

05:54.199 --> 05:56.400
Well, there's a whole
section on it here.

05:56.401 --> 05:57.952
Let's see, the investigators looked hard

05:57.953 --> 06:00.042
at the Dubai crash,
comparing it to Marsh's.

06:00.043 --> 06:02.239
Right, at the time, the screw
was rated for 15 years.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.674
Was changed to ten after.

06:03.675 --> 06:05.076
But they emphasize the only connection

06:05.077 --> 06:06.377
between Dubai and Marsh

06:06.378 --> 06:08.646
is the failure to recognize
the weakness of the alloy

06:08.647 --> 06:10.347
used in the screws in the first place.

06:10.348 --> 06:13.884
So... if someone sabotaged Marsh's plane,

06:13.885 --> 06:16.554
they knew that the investigators
would look at the Dubai crash

06:16.555 --> 06:19.657
and assume it was a similar
issue with that screw.

06:19.658 --> 06:21.292
Which is exactly what happened.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.961
Okay...

06:23.962 --> 06:27.264
so how do you sabotage
an R-47 jackscrew?

06:27.265 --> 06:28.801
The jackscrew's concealed behind

06:28.802 --> 06:30.267
the main plate and the tail section,

06:30.268 --> 06:32.703
- so...
- You're familiar with this type of plane?

06:32.704 --> 06:34.505
There are some design similarities

06:34.506 --> 06:35.973
to the F/A-18's I used to fly.

06:35.974 --> 06:37.608
And I knew every inch of that plane.

06:37.609 --> 06:39.276
- I'll study up on this.
- For now,

06:39.277 --> 06:42.079
who could have access
to that main plate?

06:42.080 --> 06:43.581
Okay, you'd have to

06:43.582 --> 06:45.149
remove the plate to get to the jackscrew

06:45.150 --> 06:47.685
and then reattach it... pretty big job.

06:47.686 --> 06:50.287
- Given security, because it
was Marsh's plane... - Right.

06:50.288 --> 06:52.289
...it could only have been
a legit maintenance worker.

06:52.290 --> 06:54.725
And of all the maintenance
workers, it would have to be

06:54.726 --> 06:56.527
someone not just rated for airframe,

06:56.528 --> 06:57.962
but with an expertise

06:57.963 --> 07:00.498
in tail section hydraulics as well.

07:00.499 --> 07:01.999
One of these five guys.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.101
So if the plane was sabotaged,

07:04.102 --> 07:06.355
one of them did it.

ELIZABETH: Doesn't feel real

07:23.099 --> 07:25.602
until the POI's go up on the whiteboard.

07:25.603 --> 07:28.627
I'll run deep background
on them... quietly.

07:28.628 --> 07:30.695
Is this what you do all day
at Langley, Isabelle?

07:30.696 --> 07:31.796
Pretty much.

07:31.797 --> 07:33.431
But it was more fun when Elizabeth was

07:33.432 --> 07:35.133
- still around.
- Yeah,

07:35.134 --> 07:38.203
hopped up on caffeine, solving mysteries

07:38.204 --> 07:39.971
the rest of the world didn't know about.

07:39.972 --> 07:42.073
If you screw up, people die.

07:42.074 --> 07:43.275
That sounds really fun.

07:43.276 --> 07:44.809
Just like old times, yeah?

07:44.810 --> 07:47.045
Except now I'm Secretary of State

07:47.046 --> 07:48.513
and my boss is the president.

07:48.514 --> 07:49.781
He's not just

07:49.782 --> 07:53.051
<i>Director Dalton in the
funny bow tie anymore.</i>

07:53.052 --> 07:54.552
I think he...

07:54.553 --> 07:55.553
Conrad, hey.

07:55.554 --> 07:57.188
Sorry to interrupt.

07:57.189 --> 07:58.556
Uh, do you have a minute, Bess?

07:58.557 --> 07:59.990
Sure.

08:00.558 --> 08:02.160
Oh, uh...

08:02.161 --> 08:04.763
let me just go get some more coffee.

08:04.764 --> 08:07.532
Oh, please.

08:07.533 --> 08:09.601
What's up?

08:09.602 --> 08:11.836
I, uh, wanted to check with you about

08:11.837 --> 08:13.605
that Dubai crash.

08:13.606 --> 08:16.940
Well, UAE prelim report
said it was an accident.

08:18.109 --> 08:20.511
What do you think?

08:21.212 --> 08:23.715
Five Iranian nationals dead.

08:23.716 --> 08:26.184
UAE is neutral toward Iran.

08:26.185 --> 08:28.019
No reason to doubt the report.

08:28.020 --> 08:30.288
And Abolfazi?

08:30.289 --> 08:32.490
Just a coincidence he was on board?

08:32.491 --> 08:37.128
Definitely bad for Iran's
nuclear ambitions.

08:37.129 --> 08:39.698
You think Mossad had
something to do with it?

08:39.698 --> 08:41.933
I don't know.

08:41.933 --> 08:44.001
It's good for us, too.

08:44.003 --> 08:46.171
Yeah.

08:46.172 --> 08:48.171
Guess we got lucky.

08:49.474 --> 08:51.776
- Let me know if you hear anything, huh?
- Yeah.

08:51.777 --> 08:53.078
<i>Maybe we shouldn't</i>

08:53.079 --> 08:55.080
be doing this.

08:55.081 --> 08:56.748
Of course we should.

08:56.749 --> 08:59.150
What are we talking about?

08:59.151 --> 09:00.618
If Marsh was murdered,

09:00.619 --> 09:02.153
whoever's behind it had no problem

09:02.154 --> 09:03.655
killing the secretary of state.

09:03.656 --> 09:05.056
We have to consider the kids.

09:05.057 --> 09:07.559
Maybe it's too dangerous
to go poking around.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.594
You know what'd be dangerous?

09:09.595 --> 09:10.595
Not knowing.

09:10.596 --> 09:12.397
Are you about to quote Sun Tzu?

09:12.398 --> 09:14.032
No, I'm more of a Patton guy.

09:14.033 --> 09:17.068
But you do need to know your enemy.

09:17.069 --> 09:18.570
It wouldn't be safe

09:18.571 --> 09:22.039
for our family for us
not to look into this.

09:24.175 --> 09:26.544
Maybe that screw just failed.

09:26.545 --> 09:29.012
Maybe it was just an accident.

09:36.254 --> 09:39.624
No, I'm not asking him
out, that's insane.

09:39.625 --> 09:40.792
Isn't it?

09:40.793 --> 09:43.728
I mean, I can't ask him out.

09:43.729 --> 09:45.497
How do you ask a guy like that out?

09:45.498 --> 09:48.500
Two shots at a big brother
that I will never get back.

09:48.501 --> 09:50.201
I have to break in my cleats, doofus.

09:50.202 --> 09:51.970
Here? Like, now?

09:51.971 --> 09:54.331
Do you actually think that
I should ask him out?

09:54.332 --> 09:55.506
I have a big game tomorrow.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.776
- Wait, your games are on Sunday.
- It's playoffs.

09:57.777 --> 09:59.043
Quarterfinals are after school.

09:59.044 --> 10:01.880
What? No. I have a seminar tomorrow.

10:01.881 --> 10:04.194
Ah, I'm gonna miss it.
I'm so sorry, Noodle.

10:04.509 --> 10:05.413
That's fine.

10:05.414 --> 10:07.262
It's only quarterfinals.

10:07.686 --> 10:08.887
I'll go.

10:08.888 --> 10:10.522
I thought your security
guy said you can't.

10:10.523 --> 10:12.657
Well, it's the playoffs.

10:12.658 --> 10:16.094
Yay. But no being diplomatic
about who you root for.

10:16.095 --> 10:19.197
No worries there. I will shamelessly

10:19.198 --> 10:20.532
cheer for you...

10:20.533 --> 10:22.233
and jeer and hiss at the other team.

10:22.234 --> 10:24.102
Oh, hey, no, you're right.

10:24.103 --> 10:25.603
Yes, I am gonna ask him out.

10:25.604 --> 10:28.072
- Well, I don't know, I need to, like...
- (both sighing)

10:28.073 --> 10:29.441
Bye, guys.

10:29.442 --> 10:32.343
- DAISY: <i>Madam Secretary.</i>
- ELIZABETH: <i>Good morning.</i>

10:32.344 --> 10:35.013
We'd like to review the protocol
for tomorrow's Nauru coffee.

10:35.014 --> 10:36.481
- Nay-who?
- Uh, Nauru.

10:36.482 --> 10:38.516
It's one of our fellow
nations on Earth, ma'am.

10:38.517 --> 10:39.818
Since when?

10:39.819 --> 10:41.419
Mm, 3,000 years ago.

10:41.420 --> 10:44.823
Uh, tiny, South Pacific
island, population 10,000,

10:44.824 --> 10:47.192
but Godfrey Yispinza,
their president, is coming,

10:47.193 --> 10:49.127
so we'll need full-on
head of state moves.

10:49.128 --> 10:52.430
Actually, Yispinza's
their foreign minister.

10:52.431 --> 10:53.995
Might want to get our facts straight

10:53.996 --> 10:56.100
- so we make those right moves.
- They are, ma'am.

10:56.101 --> 10:58.269
- He's definitely the president.
- Foreign minister.

10:58.270 --> 11:00.538
Seems my crack team
has this under control.

11:00.539 --> 11:02.006
I trust you to handle the planning.

11:02.007 --> 11:04.300
- Thank you, Madam Secretary.
- DAISY: Yes, Madam Secretary.

11:04.301 --> 11:06.336
- Morning, Blake.
- Morning, Madam Secretary.

11:06.337 --> 11:07.345
Get me Fred Cole in my office.

11:07.346 --> 11:09.846
Uh, yes, but first, there's
someone else in your office.

11:11.216 --> 11:12.217
Scary guy.

11:12.218 --> 11:14.918
(sighs heavily)

11:16.221 --> 11:17.589
Russell...

11:17.590 --> 11:20.091
you gotta stop intimidating my assistant.

11:20.092 --> 11:22.193
I can say the same about you

11:22.194 --> 11:24.362
- and the NTSB chair.
- What do you mean?

11:24.363 --> 11:26.431
I got a call from Chairman Nelson.

11:26.432 --> 11:28.700
Said you inquired about the Marsh report.

11:28.701 --> 11:29.968
That's right.

11:29.969 --> 11:32.237
(chuckles): Did you really ask if

11:32.238 --> 11:34.539
they polygraphed the maintenance guys?

11:34.540 --> 11:36.007
I just had a few questions.

11:36.008 --> 11:38.009
You planning to question the report?

11:38.010 --> 11:39.577
Of course not. But I'm sitting

11:39.578 --> 11:41.112
in Marsh's seat... I'm interested

11:41.113 --> 11:45.082
- in what happened.
- What happened is in the damn report.

11:45.984 --> 11:47.952
You know, someone recently reminded me

11:47.953 --> 11:50.054
that I'm fourth in line
for the presidency.

11:50.055 --> 11:53.391
So you don't get to come into
my office and push me around.

11:53.392 --> 11:55.693
And I'm Chief of Staff
to the actual president.

11:55.694 --> 11:58.029
It's my job to know everything

11:58.030 --> 12:00.365
and to keep peace between
all the departments.

12:00.366 --> 12:02.267
Through bullying and intimidation?

12:02.268 --> 12:04.435
Madam Secretary...

12:04.436 --> 12:09.172
don't go sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

12:09.774 --> 12:12.509
Oh, Russell, get out of my office.

12:19.373 --> 12:21.386
FRED: <i>Westmore Prep's soccer field</i>

12:21.387 --> 12:23.321
is what we call a "rat trap."

12:23.322 --> 12:25.857
Easily accessible, hard to escape.

12:25.858 --> 12:27.992
360 degrees of open area,

12:27.993 --> 12:30.194
lines of sight all around.

12:30.195 --> 12:31.763
Mm. Yeah.

12:31.764 --> 12:33.131
I see that.

12:33.132 --> 12:35.199
And now I'm asking you to make it work.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.201
I don't know if I can do that, ma'am.

12:37.202 --> 12:39.571
Well, then we have a problem.

12:39.572 --> 12:42.373
Because I am going to my
daughter's soccer game,

12:42.374 --> 12:43.841
right there,

12:43.842 --> 12:45.677
tomorrow at 2:30.

12:45.678 --> 12:48.712
Due respect... but not on my watch.

12:49.314 --> 12:51.516
Fred... you know my next move.

12:51.517 --> 12:53.785
I don't want to have to let you go.

12:53.786 --> 12:55.753
Ma'am...

12:55.754 --> 12:59.055
I already lost one Secretary of State...

13:00.091 --> 13:02.393
...I'm not losing another one.

13:02.394 --> 13:05.496
Secretary Marsh died in a plane crash.

13:05.497 --> 13:07.603
Wasn't your fault, Fred.

13:07.604 --> 13:10.534
My job is to keep the secretary safe.

13:11.102 --> 13:13.503
I don't make excuses, ma'am.

13:14.138 --> 13:15.705
Okay.

13:16.341 --> 13:18.408
How about this?

13:19.277 --> 13:21.846
You take whatever
precautions you need to.

13:21.847 --> 13:24.082
Even embarrassing ones.

13:24.083 --> 13:28.419
You could lock me in a bulletproof
bubble if you have to... just...

13:28.420 --> 13:32.022
you get me to that game.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.293
Ma'am, we really should go over

13:35.294 --> 13:37.462
the seating chart for the
Nauru coffee tomorrow.

13:37.463 --> 13:39.864
- Chart, huh?
- I know you're not a fan...

13:39.865 --> 13:41.966
Uh, wait... cancel Nauru.

13:41.967 --> 13:45.703
Bring in the, uh, Israeli
delegation instead.

13:45.704 --> 13:47.872
- On one day's notice?
- Yeah.

13:47.873 --> 13:49.941
(groans) Ma'am, the Nauru coffee

13:49.942 --> 13:52.143
has been on the books for months.

13:52.144 --> 13:56.014
Prime Minister Yispinza
is already here in DC.

13:56.015 --> 13:59.584
Somebody has got to nail
down that guy's title.

13:59.585 --> 14:00.618
Why Israel?

14:00.619 --> 14:03.021
- Why now?
- Because the secretary said so.

14:03.022 --> 14:04.589
But won't the Nauruans be offended?

14:04.590 --> 14:06.224
Of course they will.

14:06.225 --> 14:08.926
Which is why God created gift baskets.

14:08.927 --> 14:11.195
How are we supposed to prep
for Israel in less than a day?

14:11.196 --> 14:13.930
By not wasting any more time.

14:14.932 --> 14:18.236
I'll get into it with the Office
of the Chief of Protocol.

14:18.237 --> 14:20.304
(tablet chimes)

14:20.305 --> 14:22.407
- What is it?
- Uh, my landlord.

14:22.408 --> 14:24.876
The pipes in my building
burst. I gotta go.

14:24.877 --> 14:26.110
Wait. You're lying.

14:26.111 --> 14:27.712
No, I'm not.

14:27.713 --> 14:29.313
- Dude!
- I'll talk to you later.

14:29.314 --> 14:32.115
Wait... what about prepping for Israel?

14:45.096 --> 14:49.000
What do you have for me
on the secretary, Matt?

14:49.001 --> 14:51.269
I don't have anything.

14:51.270 --> 14:53.803
Of course you do.

14:54.772 --> 14:56.507
Tell me...

14:56.508 --> 14:59.476
what kind of mood she's in.

15:01.079 --> 15:03.181
I'm...

15:03.182 --> 15:05.416
I don't feel comfortable with this.

15:05.417 --> 15:08.152
Well, you were comfortable coming
to me when you worked for Marsh.

15:08.153 --> 15:09.854
That was different.

15:09.855 --> 15:12.190
She's not conspiring
against the president.

15:12.191 --> 15:14.658
What <i>is</i> she doing?

15:16.027 --> 15:19.130
I never agreed to spy
on Secretary McCord.

15:19.131 --> 15:21.197
I won't do it.

15:21.833 --> 15:25.268
Well, then think of it as keeping tabs.

15:26.604 --> 15:29.173
Come on, Matt, this is how it works.

15:29.174 --> 15:30.842
You give me something,

15:30.843 --> 15:33.711
and I give you something...

15:33.712 --> 15:37.047
Don't you want an office
in the West Wing?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.889
ISABELLE: <i>I ran deep background
on our five mechanics,</i>

15:49.890 --> 15:52.987
called in favors, came
close to breaking laws.

15:52.988 --> 15:55.189
- It's not one of them.
- Sorry.

15:55.190 --> 15:56.457
No red flags,

15:56.458 --> 15:58.726
no unexplained influxes of money

15:58.727 --> 16:01.396
or secret bank accounts,
no suspicious behavior.

16:01.397 --> 16:03.131
Well, then that's it, we're done.

16:03.132 --> 16:06.968
If the plane was sabotaged,
it had to be one of them.

16:06.969 --> 16:08.403
Maybe not.

16:08.404 --> 16:09.571
Okay, you're the one

16:09.572 --> 16:11.806
who said it had to be one of them.

16:11.807 --> 16:14.609
I've been looking over
the design of the C-600.

16:14.610 --> 16:15.944
What about it?

16:15.945 --> 16:18.313
Marsh's pilot cites

16:18.314 --> 16:20.949
a patch of severe C.A.T...
Clear Air Turbulence...

16:20.950 --> 16:23.001
in the moments before the dive.

16:23.002 --> 16:24.485
But turbulence can't take a plane down...

16:24.486 --> 16:27.455
- even I know that.
- Yeah, right, but severe C.A.T.

16:27.456 --> 16:29.591
is rough, and if there's
already metal fatigue

16:29.592 --> 16:31.826
on a part, like the R-47 jackscrew,

16:31.827 --> 16:33.394
the pressure can push it

16:33.395 --> 16:35.797
- to the breaking point.
- Which is the NTSB's conclusion.

16:35.798 --> 16:37.865
So what if it wasn't C.A.T.?

16:37.866 --> 16:39.734
What if it was something else

16:39.735 --> 16:41.803
and the pilot mistook it for turbulence?

16:41.804 --> 16:45.106
Sabotage a <i>different</i> part of the plane

16:45.107 --> 16:47.909
in order to put stress on the jackscrew?

16:47.910 --> 16:49.310
Pilot says it's turbulence,

16:49.311 --> 16:51.646
so the NTSB investigators
never questioned it.

16:51.647 --> 16:54.182
They assumed the jackscrew
cracked, which caused the tail

16:54.183 --> 16:56.401
to come apart, because
the plane was shaking.

16:56.402 --> 16:58.686
But what if the tail breaking apart

16:58.687 --> 17:01.189
is what <i>caused</i> the shaking?

17:01.190 --> 17:04.892
Which, in turn, put
pressure on the jackscrew.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.962
But wouldn't the investigators
have noted the order of events?

17:07.963 --> 17:09.163
When the plane crashed,

17:09.164 --> 17:10.832
everything was smashed to pieces.

17:10.833 --> 17:13.935
So there's no way to know
what order they broke up in.

17:13.935 --> 17:16.537
Well, look, I have...
no idea how any of this

17:16.538 --> 17:18.640
would be achieved...
it's just a crazy theory.

17:18.641 --> 17:20.808
No, it's interesting.

17:20.809 --> 17:22.810
It's like a magic trick.

17:22.810 --> 17:25.380
And then the pilot
unwittingly helps sell it

17:25.381 --> 17:27.080
by reporting turbulence.

17:27.082 --> 17:30.718
It would have to be a genius,
like a diabolical saboteur

17:30.719 --> 17:32.286
out of a Bond movie.

17:32.287 --> 17:34.689
If you were going to kill
the Secretary of State,

17:34.690 --> 17:37.724
don't you think you'd want
to hire one of those types?

17:40.361 --> 17:41.996
(video gunfire blasting)

17:41.997 --> 17:44.098
Apparently...

17:44.099 --> 17:47.902
every pair of my shoes
is out of fashion.

17:47.903 --> 17:51.372
You really needed a magazine
to tell you that, Mom?

17:51.373 --> 17:53.975
Guess I'll just embarrass
you at your game.

17:53.976 --> 17:56.244
She's already embarrassing
me at this game.

17:56.245 --> 17:58.446
Come on, Dad, stop going easy on me.

17:58.447 --> 18:00.081
- I'm not.
- (Stevie screams)

18:00.082 --> 18:02.250
Stevie! What? What?

18:02.251 --> 18:03.518
I have a date

18:03.519 --> 18:05.253
with the cutest guy on Earth!

18:05.254 --> 18:07.287
(giggling)

18:11.059 --> 18:12.894
Are you guys okay?

18:12.895 --> 18:15.262
(video game weapon firing)

18:19.267 --> 18:21.001
(sighs)

18:21.602 --> 18:23.304
Did you get my text?

18:23.305 --> 18:25.306
Yeah. All 106 of 'em.

18:25.307 --> 18:27.408
Oh, you counted them,
but you didn't respond?

18:27.409 --> 18:29.744
Look, I drafted her remarks, okay?

18:29.745 --> 18:31.579
Oh, what do you want, a Scooby snack?

18:31.580 --> 18:34.115
Where the hell have you been?

18:34.116 --> 18:37.085
I... I told you, I... my pipes burst.

18:37.086 --> 18:38.086
Then let's see the pictures

18:38.087 --> 18:39.654
of the flooding you took on your phone

18:39.655 --> 18:42.323
- for the insurance claim.
- I don't have insurance.

18:42.324 --> 18:43.624
It was a job interview.

18:43.625 --> 18:46.694
That's why you've been so preoccupied.

18:46.695 --> 18:48.529
But you already have a great job,

18:48.530 --> 18:50.098
so it must be a greater job.

18:50.099 --> 18:51.065
The White House?

18:51.066 --> 18:53.634
No... I mean, no, no, absolutely not.

18:53.635 --> 18:54.869
Oh, protest too much?

18:54.870 --> 18:56.504
No! I mean... cut-cut it out.

18:56.505 --> 18:59.172
It's a deputy spot.

19:00.007 --> 19:01.943
Hey, I need to review
the secretary's remarks.

19:01.944 --> 19:04.445
Did you get my messaging statement?

19:04.446 --> 19:06.247
- Knock, knock.
- What is it, Blake?

19:06.248 --> 19:07.849
The NASA administrator wants a meeting

19:07.850 --> 19:10.017
- with Madam Secretary.
- NASA?

19:10.018 --> 19:12.854
Does he know we only handle Earth?

19:12.855 --> 19:15.022
He said it was urgent.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.157
What's it about?

19:16.158 --> 19:17.592
Time travel.

19:17.593 --> 19:19.427
Excuse me?

19:19.428 --> 19:21.162
You heard me right.

19:21.163 --> 19:23.164
Okay.

19:23.165 --> 19:25.500
Well... if you've got a time machine,

19:25.501 --> 19:27.468
I'd sure like to borrow it.

19:27.469 --> 19:29.237
(wry laugh)

19:29.238 --> 19:31.606
You think that what I do doesn't matter,

19:31.607 --> 19:33.741
that the space program is irrelevant.

19:33.742 --> 19:35.476
The fact that my agency

19:35.477 --> 19:37.712
is the only one in the entire government

19:37.713 --> 19:39.747
currently driving a freaking SUV

19:39.748 --> 19:43.584
across the surface of
Mars isn't important.

19:43.585 --> 19:44.652
Administrator...

19:44.653 --> 19:47.054
No, no, please... call me Glenn.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.157
Glenn...

19:49.158 --> 19:51.959
my earliest memories are
of the Apollo missions.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.729
I think NASA plays a <i>vital</i> role

19:54.730 --> 19:56.230
in this country.

19:56.231 --> 19:57.532
Thank you.

19:57.533 --> 19:59.834
ELIZABETH: So how can I

19:59.835 --> 20:01.769
help you...

20:01.770 --> 20:04.405
with time travel?

20:04.406 --> 20:06.908
The Gimbal-Solander telescope

20:06.909 --> 20:09.410
is scheduled to be deployed next month.

20:09.411 --> 20:12.980
It's next-gen lenses are so powerful

20:12.981 --> 20:15.783
that they will be able
to see back in time,

20:15.784 --> 20:19.287
to the light that emanated
in the... in the milliseconds

20:19.288 --> 20:20.488
after the big bang.

20:20.489 --> 20:22.857
Now, of course, we're
placing it on the equator,

20:22.858 --> 20:25.993
in a corner of the Earth
devoid of light pollution.

20:25.994 --> 20:27.728
Let me guess:

20:27.729 --> 20:31.666
On a remote island in the South Pacific.

20:31.667 --> 20:33.234
Nauru?

20:33.235 --> 20:36.938
It was supposed to be placed on Nauru...

20:36.939 --> 20:39.373
until the State Department...

20:39.374 --> 20:41.542
insulted Nauru's Chairman
of the Cabinet Yispinza

20:41.543 --> 20:44.244
by unceremoniously canceling on him.

20:45.146 --> 20:47.747
Chairman of the Cabinet?

20:49.283 --> 20:53.020
There's been some debate
over Mr. Yispinza's title.

20:53.021 --> 20:55.089
Doesn't matter what his title is.

20:55.090 --> 20:57.124
He's threatening to cancel our contract.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.361
But there is no better place on Earth

21:00.362 --> 21:02.129
for the Gimbal-Solander.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.331
Please...

21:03.332 --> 21:06.000
make things right with Nauru.

21:06.001 --> 21:08.102
I'll do my best.

21:08.103 --> 21:09.704
ELIZABETH: Thank you.

21:09.705 --> 21:11.671
Thank <i>you.</i>

21:13.608 --> 21:15.409
Uh, Glenn...

21:15.410 --> 21:17.245
what do you think you'll...

21:17.246 --> 21:20.648
see in that billions-year-old light?

21:20.649 --> 21:23.484
It's impossible to say.

21:23.485 --> 21:25.186
Maybe God.

21:25.187 --> 21:29.056
Or secrets of the universe.

21:29.057 --> 21:32.392
The unknowable, Ms. Tolliver.

21:38.140 --> 21:39.333
NADINE: <i>The briefing book</i>

21:39.334 --> 21:41.302
for the Israeli coffee, ma'am.

21:41.303 --> 21:44.438
Oh... you really think
I'll be able to read all...

21:44.439 --> 21:48.576
172 pages between here and...
Conference Room East?

21:48.577 --> 21:51.812
Your communications department came
through on short notice. (sighs)

21:51.813 --> 21:54.015
Well, luckily, I'm pretty well versed

21:54.016 --> 21:56.416
in Israeli geopolitics.

21:57.184 --> 21:59.687
NASA guy likes you, you know.

21:59.688 --> 22:03.090
- He does not.
- Trust me... years of spy training.

22:03.091 --> 22:05.726
Plus, you know, I'm a woman.

22:05.727 --> 22:08.195
- You should ask him out.
- I couldn't.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.765
I noticed he wasn't wearing a ring.

22:10.766 --> 22:12.700
Spy training's pretty impressive.

22:12.701 --> 22:15.136
I'm not ready.

22:15.137 --> 22:18.239
- I don't want to overstep.
- Too late.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.074
(sighs)

22:20.075 --> 22:22.408
Nadine, you deserve to be happy.

22:23.911 --> 22:26.480
Besides...

22:26.481 --> 22:29.350
maybe he'll let you drive the Mars Rover.

22:29.351 --> 22:31.718
See you in there.

22:39.557 --> 22:41.529
MATT: <i>I am the writer.</i>

22:41.530 --> 22:42.872
Look, I'm in charge of the messaging.

22:42.873 --> 22:44.031
Is-is that even a word?

22:44.032 --> 22:45.066
I'm gonna punch you.

22:45.067 --> 22:46.734
Hey! You need to work

22:46.735 --> 22:48.135
- together.
- MATT: Great.

22:48.136 --> 22:51.973
So I will write the
talking points, and then

22:51.974 --> 22:53.607
you can... message them

22:53.608 --> 22:54.842
however you want.

22:54.843 --> 22:56.510
No. I'll craft the message first.

22:56.511 --> 22:58.182
- You sound ridic...
- (woman screaming)

22:58.183 --> 23:00.246
- What the hell was that?
- Uh...

23:01.115 --> 23:02.616
(woman crying)

23:02.617 --> 23:04.648
Oh, my God, he was just here.
How can this be happening?

23:04.649 --> 23:06.520
Maybe they got it wrong.
Do we have confirmation?

23:06.521 --> 23:07.722
NADINE: What is it?

23:07.723 --> 23:10.456
(crying, murmuring)

23:11.058 --> 23:13.493
Uh...

23:14.495 --> 23:16.430
(woman crying)

23:16.431 --> 23:19.200
Uh, Secretary Marsh's plane...

23:19.201 --> 23:21.402
went down in the Atlantic.

23:21.403 --> 23:23.137
(gasps, shudders)

23:23.138 --> 23:25.006
Coast Guard confirms.

23:25.007 --> 23:27.607
There's no survivors.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.949
Gather all the undersecretaries.

23:34.950 --> 23:38.052
Get them all in here right now.

23:38.053 --> 23:39.286
Jay, go!

23:39.287 --> 23:40.254
Yeah, okay, yeah, come on,

23:40.255 --> 23:41.821
all right, people come on.

23:45.559 --> 23:47.395
ELIZABETH: <i>Our challenges
in the Middle East</i>

23:47.396 --> 23:49.363
are great, but our commitment

23:49.364 --> 23:52.333
to a shared vision of
peace and prosperity

23:52.334 --> 23:54.602
in the region needs to be even greater.

23:54.603 --> 23:56.837
Thank you all for coming.

23:56.838 --> 23:59.205
Now eat.

24:02.209 --> 24:04.245
Ambassador Dori.

24:04.246 --> 24:06.147
Ah, Madam Secretary.

24:06.148 --> 24:08.349
Your remarks were very gracious.

24:08.350 --> 24:09.950
Thanks for saying that.

24:09.951 --> 24:11.719
They often feel a little canned.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.687
I know the feeling.

24:13.688 --> 24:17.258
Sometimes I miss our old jobs.

24:17.259 --> 24:19.260
Being under the radar.

24:19.261 --> 24:22.663
I don't think I'll ever get used
to talking about what I'm doing.

24:22.664 --> 24:24.532
(laughs)

24:24.533 --> 24:27.468
Well, speaking of things
that you didn't talk about...

24:27.469 --> 24:31.338
the C-600 crash in Dubai in 2003...

24:31.339 --> 24:33.541
there were whisperings that
Mossad was behind that.

24:33.542 --> 24:37.078
Were there?

24:37.079 --> 24:39.013
If I remember it correctly,

24:39.014 --> 24:41.916
the investigation concluded
it was an accident.

24:41.917 --> 24:44.418
Iran's top nuclear
physicist was on board.

24:44.419 --> 24:46.452
A happy accident.

24:47.888 --> 24:50.391
Well, hypothetically,

24:50.392 --> 24:52.960
if it weren't an accident,

24:52.961 --> 24:55.129
might you have engineered the means

24:55.130 --> 24:57.731
by which pressure was
placed on the tail section,

24:57.732 --> 25:00.468
over-stressing the R-47 jackscrew?

25:00.469 --> 25:04.105
You have quite a knowledge
of avionics, Madam Secretary.

25:04.106 --> 25:06.707
So, am I right?

25:06.708 --> 25:09.310
Think of it as reminiscing.

25:09.311 --> 25:11.579
We're just talking hypotheticals here.

25:11.580 --> 25:15.349
If you wanted to
overstress the jackscrew,

25:15.350 --> 25:17.852
you would remove the
tail plate and strip

25:17.853 --> 25:20.187
the threads on the
vertical stabilizer nut.

25:20.188 --> 25:22.256
Tail plate. That's removed during...

25:22.257 --> 25:23.491
Removed during fueling.

25:23.492 --> 25:24.925
Right.

25:24.926 --> 25:27.194
And subject to infrequent
inspections for wear.

25:27.195 --> 25:31.232
Once the control starts to slip,

25:31.233 --> 25:33.434
the plane would begin to shake.

25:33.435 --> 25:36.137
And the pilot would likely
just report it as turbulence.

25:36.138 --> 25:37.371
It would stress

25:37.372 --> 25:40.040
the tail section to the point that even

25:40.041 --> 25:42.476
a correctly-maintained
jackscrew would fail.

25:42.477 --> 25:45.179
Hypothetically, of course.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.381
Was the CIA involved?

25:47.382 --> 25:50.417
You have to ask me?

25:50.418 --> 25:52.720
U.S. had as much skin
in the game as Israel.

25:52.721 --> 25:55.322
Please just tell me if anyone in the CIA

25:55.323 --> 25:57.324
was read into it.

25:57.325 --> 26:01.061
I think we have reminisced
enough, Madam Secretary.

26:01.062 --> 26:03.463
A pleasure.

26:10.372 --> 26:12.907
ISABELLE: The fueling
technician, John Castellano.

26:12.908 --> 26:14.842
He has an honest face.

26:14.843 --> 26:16.777
Hidden bank account. Caymans.

26:16.778 --> 26:18.379
As buried as you get.

26:18.380 --> 26:21.348
Well, trust me, you don't
want to know how I found it,

26:21.349 --> 26:23.450
but I'm not at all
surprised the NTSB didn't.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.886
Disgruntled Interpol finance agent?

26:25.887 --> 26:28.289
Oh, I'm not telling. You
need plausible deniability.

26:28.290 --> 26:29.690
Fine. Any activity?

26:29.691 --> 26:30.991
Day before the crash,

26:30.992 --> 26:33.260
half a million dollars
showed up in the account.

26:33.261 --> 26:34.528
From where?

26:34.529 --> 26:35.996
Untraceable.

26:35.997 --> 26:38.465
Think it could be a coincidence?

26:38.466 --> 26:40.334
Running drugs through the airport...

26:40.335 --> 26:42.269
Or smuggling, money laundering.

26:42.270 --> 26:43.604
No, we're not gonna know until we get him

26:43.605 --> 26:44.772
into a room and break him.

26:44.773 --> 26:46.073
You think that's a good idea?

26:46.074 --> 26:48.441
No.

26:50.211 --> 26:52.179
But we're all in now.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.447
What makes you think he'd break?

26:55.482 --> 26:57.917
The play's the thing.

27:00.821 --> 27:03.457
That'd be a hell of a
bold move, unprecedented.

27:03.458 --> 27:06.227
You sure you want to go there?

27:06.228 --> 27:08.229
All in.

27:08.230 --> 27:10.197
Bess.

27:10.198 --> 27:13.167
It could put the entire
administration at risk.

27:13.168 --> 27:15.535
I don't know who I can trust.

27:16.537 --> 27:18.505
Just get him in a room.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.940
I don't care how you do it.

27:29.603 --> 27:31.105
Hi, Matt.

27:31.106 --> 27:33.007
Hey, Blake.

27:33.008 --> 27:34.942
What can I do for you?

27:34.943 --> 27:39.146
No, just... just saying hey.

27:39.147 --> 27:41.748
- Please don't. Please.
- Sorry.

27:43.275 --> 27:45.782
So, um, uh, what's up with
the secretary canceling

27:45.783 --> 27:47.783
on Nauru and bringing in Israel?

27:47.784 --> 27:50.252
Is this small talk, or
do you have an agenda?

27:50.253 --> 27:52.621
- I'm just checking in with you, dude.
- Please don't.

27:52.622 --> 27:54.456
What, we're-we're human beings, you know?

27:54.457 --> 27:55.724
We're social creatures.

27:55.725 --> 27:58.859
Okay, now you're just
making me uncomfortable.

28:06.835 --> 28:09.072
(knocking)

28:10.662 --> 28:12.213
Glenn.

28:12.214 --> 28:14.315
I hope you don't mind me stopping by.

28:14.316 --> 28:15.310
Not at all.

28:15.311 --> 28:16.678
Had a meeting downstairs

28:16.679 --> 28:18.914
about a joint satellite
launch with Japan,

28:18.915 --> 28:22.418
and just want to say thank you for...

28:22.419 --> 28:24.019
making nice with Nauru.

28:24.020 --> 28:27.790
Well, it's our job... making nice.

28:27.791 --> 28:29.625
You're good at it.

28:29.626 --> 28:31.660
Telescope is back on track.

28:31.661 --> 28:34.296
And President Yispinza

28:34.297 --> 28:36.632
is over the moon about that
state lunch you're planning.

28:36.633 --> 28:37.866
President?

28:37.867 --> 28:39.902
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, and Prime Minister.

28:39.903 --> 28:41.837
And foreign minister,

28:41.838 --> 28:44.273
and chairman of the cabinet.

28:44.274 --> 28:45.707
Small country.

28:45.708 --> 28:47.109
Not enough politicians.

28:47.110 --> 28:48.544
Ah.

28:48.545 --> 28:50.078
He wears all the hats.

28:50.079 --> 28:51.914
He also runs a fish and tackle shop.

28:51.915 --> 28:53.816
(laughs)

28:53.817 --> 28:57.619
Well, we'll be sure
we get the protocol right

28:57.620 --> 28:59.988
for all of his positions.

28:59.989 --> 29:04.526
I would love to hear about
how you plan a lunch like that.

29:04.527 --> 29:07.396
Uh, perhaps over lunch?

29:07.397 --> 29:09.932
Oh...

29:09.933 --> 29:13.435
um, I-I really can't leave today.

29:13.436 --> 29:16.271
The secretary is at her
daughter's soccer game,

29:16.272 --> 29:18.974
and I'm holding down the fort.

29:18.975 --> 29:20.242
Maybe another time.

29:20.243 --> 29:23.412
I hold down the fort a lot.

29:23.413 --> 29:26.614
Of course.

29:29.084 --> 29:32.888
I actually ought to go check on <i>my</i> fort.

29:32.889 --> 29:34.122
Yeah.

29:34.123 --> 29:35.691
Thanks again.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.092
You're welcome.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.101
(girls shouting)

29:46.102 --> 29:49.872
(crowd shouting)

29:49.873 --> 29:51.540
ELIZABETH: Come on, Wildcats!

29:51.541 --> 29:53.274
Come on, Wildcats!

29:57.779 --> 29:59.114
Clear it out of there!

29:59.115 --> 30:00.649
Come on, girls!

30:00.650 --> 30:02.751
Come on!

30:02.752 --> 30:05.120
- Yes!
- (cheering)

30:05.121 --> 30:06.355
MAN: Great save. Great save, guys.

30:06.356 --> 30:07.589
Thataway!

30:07.590 --> 30:09.725
(Elizabeth whoops)
(crowd cheers)

30:09.726 --> 30:11.693
John Castellano?

30:11.694 --> 30:13.295
Ms. Barnes.

30:13.296 --> 30:14.630
Ah, no. Call me Laura.

30:14.631 --> 30:16.164
Thanks for meeting me here today.

30:16.165 --> 30:18.200
I've just had appointments all over town.

30:18.201 --> 30:19.868
It's-it's no problem.

30:19.869 --> 30:21.336
I appreciate the opportunity.

30:21.337 --> 30:22.871
Oh, I like your attitude already.

30:22.872 --> 30:24.873
And I think the Jandermann Group will, too.

30:24.874 --> 30:26.241
Mr. Jandermann likes positive,

30:26.242 --> 30:27.643
- can-do folks.
- (laughs)

30:27.644 --> 30:29.711
And from what I understand, he pays better

30:29.712 --> 30:30.879
than my current employer, so...

30:30.880 --> 30:32.080
Yeah, if you like that kind of thing.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.016
- (laughs) Yeah.
- (laughing): Yeah.

30:34.017 --> 30:36.451
So... let's talk fueling.

30:36.452 --> 30:38.854
- Okay.
- Yeah.

30:38.855 --> 30:42.558
(indistinct, overlapping shouting)

30:42.559 --> 30:44.092
(whistle blowing)

30:44.093 --> 30:46.093
- Yes!
- (cheering)

30:49.565 --> 30:50.933
(crowd sighing and groaning)

30:50.934 --> 30:53.735
Whoa! What? What? No call?

30:53.736 --> 30:54.970
Ah, that's a legal play, ma'am.

30:54.971 --> 30:57.471
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm just...

31:01.643 --> 31:03.245
(whistle blowing)

31:03.246 --> 31:04.780
Halftime! Ten minutes!

31:04.781 --> 31:07.648
Good half. Great half.

31:10.953 --> 31:13.621
- I want to... I want to go see her.
- Okay.

31:15.991 --> 31:18.193
I can't get over you out there!

31:18.194 --> 31:20.095
Can you believe that dive stop I made?

31:20.096 --> 31:21.997
If I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes, no.

31:21.998 --> 31:24.499
- Can you believe? Fred, did you see that?
- She was really great.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.801
- Did you see that save?
- She was great.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.636
Ma'am, uh, listen, can
you take a secure call?

31:27.637 --> 31:29.404
- Sure.
- I can hang back with the team.

31:29.405 --> 31:31.273
No, no, no, I want, I
want you to hang with me.

31:31.274 --> 31:33.274
Come on, come on. Come on.

31:38.547 --> 31:39.848
Baby.

31:39.849 --> 31:41.582
(laughs)

31:43.385 --> 31:46.054
Listen, Noodle, something's come up.

31:46.055 --> 31:49.257
- Don't you have to take that call?
- Actually, no.

31:49.258 --> 31:52.260
I need a favor.

31:52.261 --> 31:53.428
That's all I have.

31:53.429 --> 31:55.564
Do you have any questions
for me, Mr. Castellano?

31:55.565 --> 31:57.366
Yeah. When do I start?

31:57.367 --> 31:58.734
(both laugh)

31:58.735 --> 32:00.669
Hey, you know what? How about this?

32:00.670 --> 32:02.137
Mr. Jandermann is heading back

32:02.138 --> 32:03.972
to Houston tonight, but
I think I can get him

32:03.973 --> 32:05.574
to sit down with you for a few minutes

32:05.575 --> 32:07.776
in his hotel room, if you're free now.

32:07.777 --> 32:09.678
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.979
Great.

32:26.428 --> 32:28.796
(sighs)

32:30.465 --> 32:32.401
I owe you one, Fred.

32:32.402 --> 32:35.135
This never happened, ma'am.

32:39.074 --> 32:40.208
Fancy place.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.610
Yeah, Mr. Jandermann does all right.

32:43.779 --> 32:45.814
You have a key?

32:45.815 --> 32:48.148
Yup.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.359
Have a seat.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.729
So, he's, uh... he's here?

33:00.730 --> 33:03.130
Oh, yeah. He'll be right up.

33:09.504 --> 33:12.439
Yeah, something feels off about this.

33:13.709 --> 33:16.143
Sit down, Mr. Castellano.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.582
Sit.

33:24.186 --> 33:26.088
Do you know who I am?

33:26.089 --> 33:27.122
What the hell is sh...

33:27.123 --> 33:29.823
Who am I, Mr. Castellano? Say it.

33:31.226 --> 33:33.562
You're-you're the...

33:33.563 --> 33:35.430
you're the Secretary of State.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.399
That's right.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.935
Did you know my
predecessor, Vincent Marsh?

33:44.473 --> 33:48.142
Did you kill Secretary
of State Vincent Marsh?

33:58.411 --> 34:00.812
I'm gonna ask you again.

34:02.248 --> 34:05.405
Did you kill Secretary
of State Vincent Marsh

34:05.406 --> 34:08.976
by sabotaging his C-600 jet?

34:08.978 --> 34:11.478
ISABELLE: As you fueled the
plane, you opened the tail plate

34:11.480 --> 34:12.614
and stripped the vertical

34:12.614 --> 34:14.781
stabilizer nut, isn't that right?

34:17.052 --> 34:18.553
I see it is.

34:18.554 --> 34:21.089
And you received $500,000 for your trouble

34:21.090 --> 34:23.257
in a numbered Cayman account.
I take it that wasn't...

34:23.259 --> 34:24.359
lottery winnings.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.994
I don't even know what's happening here.

34:25.995 --> 34:27.996
- I don't want to be here.
- You're free to go

34:27.996 --> 34:29.197
anytime you like.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.132
Problem is, if you do,
we can't guarantee

34:31.132 --> 34:32.934
you won't be grabbed up
and thrown in a hole

34:32.935 --> 34:34.069
for the rest of your life.

34:34.070 --> 34:36.004
I don't want that any more than you do.

34:36.005 --> 34:40.241
Now, obviously, somebody put
you up to sabotaging that plane.

34:40.242 --> 34:41.943
If you tell me the truth,

34:41.944 --> 34:45.480
I can make sure that
you're treated fairly.

34:45.481 --> 34:47.549
How do I know I can trust you?

34:47.550 --> 34:49.551
You don't.

34:49.552 --> 34:52.954
But I am the Secretary of State

34:52.955 --> 34:56.156
and you don't have any better options.

34:56.824 --> 34:59.926
Let me help you, John.

35:05.166 --> 35:07.502
They said I couldn't talk to anybody.

35:07.503 --> 35:09.571
- Who?
- I don't know.

35:09.572 --> 35:11.506
Then how did they communicate with you?

35:11.507 --> 35:14.175
Phone.

35:14.176 --> 35:16.744
I get this call

35:16.745 --> 35:21.381
saying my kid's life's in danger
I don't do exactly as they say.

35:23.585 --> 35:25.787
And they send me an e-mail

35:25.788 --> 35:28.523
with a live video link

35:28.524 --> 35:32.260
of my daughter in her
preschool playground

35:32.261 --> 35:36.663
with one of those laser red
target dots on her forehead.

35:37.265 --> 35:39.767
My four-year-old girl.

35:39.768 --> 35:41.768
Male or female voice?

35:42.437 --> 35:45.006
I don't know.

35:45.007 --> 35:47.275
It was one of those, uh,

35:47.276 --> 35:50.745
electronically altered voices.

35:50.746 --> 35:53.014
Said I, um...

35:53.015 --> 35:56.484
I don't do exactly as
they say, she's dead.

35:56.485 --> 36:00.388
If I called the cops
or talked to anybody...

36:00.389 --> 36:02.357
they'd kill my whole family.

36:02.358 --> 36:04.392
When I saw the half mil in the bank,

36:04.393 --> 36:05.960
that's when I knew it was for real.

36:05.961 --> 36:08.196
And the instructions
for sabotaging the plane?

36:08.197 --> 36:11.432
E-mail.

36:11.433 --> 36:15.103
You know, I'm just a fueler.
(wry chuckle)

36:15.104 --> 36:17.338
I didn't know exactly what it would do.

36:17.339 --> 36:20.534
Not that I didn't have some idea.

36:22.077 --> 36:25.213
When I saw that the plane crashed...

36:25.214 --> 36:28.349
I'm sorry, but what
was I supposed to do?

36:28.350 --> 36:29.804
Did you have any other communications

36:29.805 --> 36:30.718
with these people?

36:30.719 --> 36:31.686
No. No.

36:31.687 --> 36:34.389
I-I didn't even touch the money.

36:34.390 --> 36:37.125
No matter what the circumstances were,

36:37.126 --> 36:39.661
you were a part of the assassination

36:39.662 --> 36:41.196
of the Secretary of State.

36:41.197 --> 36:46.301
Now, if I have you arrested,
it'll tip off whoever hired you.

36:46.302 --> 36:48.736
That's why I'm letting you go.

36:48.737 --> 36:52.674
And then, as long as you stay quiet,

36:52.675 --> 36:55.710
and never speak a word of any of this,

36:55.711 --> 36:57.879
I can protect you.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.748
And I can protect your daughter.

37:00.749 --> 37:02.884
That's the only way.

37:02.885 --> 37:04.752
Okay.

37:04.753 --> 37:08.156
Ms. Barnes will contact you
about getting into your...

37:08.157 --> 37:10.525
computer and your e-mails.

37:10.526 --> 37:12.126
You'll cooperate.

37:12.127 --> 37:14.662
Yes.

37:14.663 --> 37:16.530
Now go.

37:31.813 --> 37:33.880
Now what?

37:36.985 --> 37:38.987
Special delivery.

37:38.988 --> 37:40.455
What?!

37:40.456 --> 37:41.789
Security sent them up.

37:41.790 --> 37:43.990
From an admirer of yours.

37:46.894 --> 37:49.397
Lose the smirk, Blake,

37:49.398 --> 37:50.632
and get back to your desk.

37:50.633 --> 37:53.033
(quiet titter)

38:04.069 --> 38:07.694
_

38:09.917 --> 38:11.685
(sighs)

38:13.588 --> 38:15.723
Ma'am, do you have a minute?

38:15.724 --> 38:17.158
No, not really.

38:17.159 --> 38:19.559
It's important.

38:20.194 --> 38:21.561
(sighs)

38:25.400 --> 38:27.734
What's wrong?

38:28.369 --> 38:31.306
Ma'am, I need to come clean.

38:31.307 --> 38:35.677
I kind of spied on Secretary
Marsh for Russell Jackson.

38:35.678 --> 38:37.211
"Kind of"?

38:37.212 --> 38:40.848
Marsh was going to run against
Dalton in the next cycle.

38:40.849 --> 38:43.284
He never acknowledged it directly,

38:43.285 --> 38:45.720
but he had me writing
all of these speeches

38:45.721 --> 38:48.056
with policy positions that
were completely out of whack

38:48.057 --> 38:49.324
with the administration.

38:49.325 --> 38:52.393
Said he wanted to have
them, just in case.

38:52.394 --> 38:54.362
That's a hell of a dilemma, Matt.

38:54.363 --> 38:56.331
You're telling me. I, uh...

38:56.332 --> 38:58.666
I was popping antacids like Tic Tacs,

38:58.667 --> 39:01.569
wrestling with whether
to be loyal to Marsh

39:01.570 --> 39:04.572
or Dalton.

39:04.573 --> 39:06.774
I decided that, ultimately,

39:06.775 --> 39:09.477
we all serve at the
pleasure of the president.

39:09.478 --> 39:11.145
So you told Jackson.

39:11.146 --> 39:12.580
How'd he take it?

39:12.581 --> 39:16.017
How do you think?

39:16.018 --> 39:18.252
Give me a little more
poetry in this section.

39:18.253 --> 39:20.855
- You got it.
- JACKSON: Vincent,

39:20.856 --> 39:22.957
we need to talk.

39:22.958 --> 39:25.358
Thanks, Matt.

39:31.766 --> 39:34.235
JACKSON (muffled): You're
planning to run, aren't you?

39:34.236 --> 39:36.070
MARSH (muffled): Excuse me?

39:36.071 --> 39:38.306
JACKSON: Against Dalton
in the next cycle.

39:38.307 --> 39:39.273
(scoffs)

39:39.274 --> 39:41.142
Where'd you get that?

39:41.143 --> 39:42.844
Not denying much?

39:42.845 --> 39:45.079
I'm not dignifying the question.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.782
You know, I tried to convince
Dalton not to go with you,

39:47.783 --> 39:52.085
but the old boys in the party
thought it was your turn.

39:52.754 --> 39:54.355
What do you want?

39:54.356 --> 39:56.190
I'm just putting you on notice.

39:56.191 --> 39:59.761
You don't back-stab the
president of your own party

39:59.762 --> 40:02.028
without consequences.

40:08.736 --> 40:11.339
Is that a threat, Russell?

40:11.340 --> 40:14.708
It's a guarantee.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.812
I speak for the president on this.

40:17.813 --> 40:20.915
- As you might imagine, he's pretty upset.
- And he'll have

40:20.916 --> 40:23.651
no compunction whatsoever
slitting the throat of someone

40:23.652 --> 40:25.186
who has been a staunch ally

40:25.187 --> 40:27.221
and helped get him elected?

40:27.222 --> 40:30.123
So it goes.

40:31.926 --> 40:34.095
ELIZABETH: <i>"So it goes."</i>

40:34.096 --> 40:35.863
He said that?

40:35.864 --> 40:36.998
Yeah.

40:36.999 --> 40:39.200
It was an odd turn of phrase.

40:39.201 --> 40:41.469
It stuck with me.

40:41.470 --> 40:43.070
Why does it matter?

40:43.071 --> 40:45.606
And he specifically said
the president was upset?

40:45.607 --> 40:48.142
Yeah. Of course the president was upset.

40:48.143 --> 40:49.877
You tell anyone else?

40:49.878 --> 40:52.146
No.

40:52.147 --> 40:55.817
But when Marsh's plane went down,

40:55.818 --> 40:57.618
I-I couldn't help but wonder

40:57.619 --> 40:59.754
if they had something to do with it.

40:59.755 --> 41:02.824
I-I mean, I felt like a
crazy conspiracy theorist.

41:02.825 --> 41:05.059
I was relieved when the
NTSB report came out.

41:05.060 --> 41:08.696
I bet.

41:08.697 --> 41:10.830
So why tell me now?

41:12.967 --> 41:16.936
Because now Jackson
wants me to spy on you.

41:17.605 --> 41:19.240
Really?

41:19.241 --> 41:22.243
Yeah, in exchange for a
job at the White House.

41:22.244 --> 41:23.811
I tried to tell him no,

41:23.812 --> 41:26.680
but he made me promise
to think about it.

41:29.817 --> 41:31.552
Tell him you'll do it.

41:31.553 --> 41:32.687
What?

41:32.688 --> 41:34.121
Why?

41:34.122 --> 41:37.558
Now that I know that he's spying
on me, I can use a double agent.

41:37.559 --> 41:39.994
No, no, no, I-I don't think
that-that's a good idea.

41:39.995 --> 41:42.930
Matt, you've been dishonest.

41:42.931 --> 41:45.165
Think of it as your penance.

41:51.439 --> 41:55.276
PILOT (recorded): <i>The
stabilizer's failed completely.</i>

41:55.277 --> 41:58.212
I cannot keep us in the air.

41:58.213 --> 42:00.548
MARSH: So it goes.

42:00.549 --> 42:02.950
PILOT: Trying to push and...

42:02.951 --> 42:04.552
(sighs)

42:04.553 --> 42:06.521
When his plane was going down,

42:06.522 --> 42:08.256
Vincent Marsh was thinking

42:08.257 --> 42:10.825
Jackson and Dalton were behind it.

42:10.826 --> 42:12.994
That doesn't mean he was right.

42:12.995 --> 42:15.263
Ambassador Dori didn't deny

42:15.264 --> 42:17.965
that the CIA was involved
in the Dubai crash.

42:17.966 --> 42:21.869
If they were, then Dalton
knew how to sabotage a C-600

42:21.870 --> 42:23.871
and get away with it.

42:23.872 --> 42:25.406
Maybe he tapped me

42:25.407 --> 42:28.309
because he didn't think
I'd ever suspect him.

42:28.310 --> 42:30.778
Your loyalty is your soft spot?

42:30.779 --> 42:32.980
Maybe I'm Secretary of State

42:32.981 --> 42:34.649
because he wanted to keep me close,

42:34.650 --> 42:36.884
which would explain
Russell making overtures

42:36.885 --> 42:39.352
to Matt about spying on me.

42:41.589 --> 42:44.625
I'm calling the President of
the United States a murderer.

42:44.626 --> 42:49.863
Now is really a time for you to
start talking me off the ledge.

42:51.332 --> 42:53.701
I'm sorry, babe.

42:53.702 --> 42:56.503
(sighs) I got nothing.

42:57.772 --> 43:00.673
What's my next move?

43:01.309 --> 43:03.176
(phone blips, buzzes)

43:07.982 --> 43:11.284
They need me in the Situation Room.

43:16.157 --> 43:18.558
(speaking quietly)

43:25.266 --> 43:26.500
(echoing): Bess.

43:26.501 --> 43:28.369
North Korea's acting out again.

43:28.370 --> 43:30.737
Let's catch you up.

43:38.100 --> 43:45.666
