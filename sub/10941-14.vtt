00:03.189 --> 00:04.222
Will you marry me?

00:04.290 --> 00:07.158
Yes. Yes,
I will marry you.

00:07.226 --> 00:09.227
- Daisy has strangles.
- Strangles?

00:09.295 --> 00:11.462
I'm really sorry,
but she's gotta stay here.

00:11.530 --> 00:12.563
Yeah. Okay.

00:12.631 --> 00:14.198
Scott told me
to make an offering.

00:14.266 --> 00:16.334
I'm not really into that
spiritual stuff though.

00:16.402 --> 00:18.736
Here.
Take your time.

00:19.338 --> 00:21.238
I got a gold cheque
burning a hole in my pocket.

00:21.306 --> 00:23.040
To match that hole
in your head?

00:23.107 --> 00:24.274
What'd I say?

00:24.342 --> 00:25.675
Who's gonna take
a bronc rider seriously

00:25.743 --> 00:28.145
as boyfriend material?

00:30.881 --> 00:33.216
♪

00:34.152 --> 00:35.085
(Laughing)
Whoa-ho-ho!

00:35.153 --> 00:36.652
That's awesome!

00:36.719 --> 00:38.554
(Stunned laugh)

00:38.621 --> 00:39.721
Bareback broncs,

00:39.789 --> 00:40.923
that's what I'm into now.

00:40.991 --> 00:42.858
I'm totally going
for all 'round cowboy.

00:42.926 --> 00:45.227
Oh my God,
I can't watch.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.695
Ty:
Oh man, he's crazy.

00:46.763 --> 00:48.364
Amy:
Yeah. He's totally insane.

00:48.432 --> 00:49.932
Caleb: You see that guy?
Ty: Yeah.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.300
Caleb: Josh Cooley, he's
the one I gotta beat.

00:51.368 --> 00:52.767
Okay. Yeah, he's the best.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.235
I don't know how he does it.
He never sleeps.

00:54.303 --> 00:55.236
He just parties
with the ladies

00:55.304 --> 00:56.471
all night long.

00:56.538 --> 00:57.705
Actually,
the last time,

00:57.773 --> 00:58.639
he brought his
girlfriend along,

00:58.707 --> 00:59.774
idiot didn't win
anything.

00:59.842 --> 01:00.875
Amy:
Oh, that's nice.

01:02.544 --> 01:04.179
Ty:
Oh! That's gotta hurt.

01:04.245 --> 01:06.681
Caleb: Just watching this
makes me miss the circuit.

01:06.748 --> 01:08.249
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Where'd you go last time?</i>

01:08.317 --> 01:09.851
Caleb:
The four corners:

01:09.918 --> 01:13.320
Colorado, Arizona, Utah,
and New Mexico.

01:13.388 --> 01:15.389
I love being on the road.
There's nothing like it.

01:15.457 --> 01:17.424
Especially if you have
a death wish.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.297
Hey, there's a rodeo coming up
in Great Falls, Montana.

01:23.365 --> 01:24.965
If I get in,
you should come with me.

01:25.032 --> 01:26.099
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:26.166 --> 01:27.734
Yeah. Well,
we'd have a blast.

01:27.802 --> 01:29.235
Ashley:
I gotta go.

01:29.303 --> 01:30.871
Amy: Ashley, come on, stay.
I rented a movie.

01:30.938 --> 01:32.606
These testosterone boys
are done watching

01:32.673 --> 01:34.140
their rodeo's greatest hits.

01:34.208 --> 01:35.876
I can't. My mom has
a doctor's appointment

01:35.943 --> 01:37.878
really early in the morning.

01:37.945 --> 01:39.012
Okay.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.013
Oh yeah,
sure thing.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.848
Let's hit the road.

01:42.916 --> 01:44.049
Soraya: Um, yeah. I should go too.
You mind giving me a ride?

01:44.117 --> 01:45.484
Yeah.
No problem.

01:45.552 --> 01:47.152
<i>Next trip -</i>
<i>you, me and Montana, huh?</i>

01:47.220 --> 01:48.286
All right, man.
All right.

01:49.756 --> 01:51.023
See you, guys.

01:51.090 --> 01:51.824
Caleb:
By Amy.

01:51.892 --> 01:52.892
Amy:
See you.

when you get home?

02:03.468 --> 02:04.536
See you.

02:05.671 --> 02:06.738
(Engine revs)

02:09.174 --> 02:10.875
What was that about?

02:10.943 --> 02:13.109
Rodeo videos?
Ashley?

02:13.177 --> 02:14.745
When are you ever
gonna learn?

02:14.812 --> 02:17.814
Nah. It's all just an act
that she hates what I do.

02:17.882 --> 02:19.349
Underneath, she's digs it.

02:23.254 --> 02:25.923
It would be fun hanging out
on the rodeo circuit.

02:25.990 --> 02:28.091
No bull riding!
Promise me.

02:28.159 --> 02:29.559
Well, maybe not right away.

02:29.626 --> 02:31.193
Amy:
No! Not ever.

02:31.261 --> 02:33.896
Ty, come on,
you're not actually thinking

02:33.964 --> 02:35.031
of going with Caleb?

02:35.098 --> 02:36.899
You two would drive
each other crazy.

02:36.967 --> 02:38.100
It'd be fun.

02:38.168 --> 02:39.201
I haven't done much
travelling,

02:39.269 --> 02:40.803
been anywhere else
in the world.

02:40.871 --> 02:42.104
It's pretty scary

02:42.172 --> 02:43.940
when Caleb's gotten around
more than I have.

02:44.007 --> 02:45.173
I'd love to do
some travelling.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.475
We should go somewhere
together.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.811
Yeah,
that'd be fun.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.615
I'm gonna put this away.

02:58.187 --> 02:59.721
Hey,
was it just my imagination

02:59.789 --> 03:01.254
or were the people
at that party

03:01.322 --> 03:03.290
a bit condescending?

03:03.357 --> 03:04.324
Condescending?

03:04.392 --> 03:05.559
Yeah.

03:05.627 --> 03:07.728
You know, poking fun
at my dude ranch,

03:07.796 --> 03:09.997
at the jam enterprise.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.164
No, sweetheart,

03:11.232 --> 03:12.733
you were a breath
of fresh air

03:12.801 --> 03:15.535
in an otherwise very stuffy
corporate crowd.

03:15.604 --> 03:17.136
A breath of country
bumpkin air,

03:17.204 --> 03:18.471
more like it.

03:18.538 --> 03:21.273
And I was totally cornered
by that woman...

03:21.341 --> 03:23.476
What... what was her name again?

03:25.045 --> 03:26.345
Poppy Madison.

03:26.513 --> 03:28.047
Lou:
Yes, yes. Poppy.

03:28.115 --> 03:29.615
<i>How could I forget?</i>

03:29.683 --> 03:31.117
I suppose you know
that Poppy

03:31.185 --> 03:33.284
is still friends
with your ex-wife?

03:33.352 --> 03:34.953
I uh...

03:35.021 --> 03:36.088
Yeah,
they used to be close.

03:36.155 --> 03:37.222
Oh, I think
they still are,

03:37.289 --> 03:39.424
because Poppy made it
her job

03:39.491 --> 03:41.893
to tell me all about
your first wedding.

03:41.961 --> 03:43.028
What?

03:43.096 --> 03:44.963
Yup. She gave me
the full lowdown.

03:45.031 --> 03:48.100
How huge it was,
how expensive...

03:48.167 --> 03:49.166
Apparently,

03:49.234 --> 03:50.968
it was "the wedding
of the year."

03:51.036 --> 03:52.269
She may as well
have just said,

03:52.337 --> 03:53.838
hey, good luck topping
your husband-to-be's

03:53.905 --> 03:56.741
first wedding extravaganza.

03:56.808 --> 03:58.142
And then she actually acted

03:58.210 --> 04:00.510
like she expected
an invitation.

04:00.578 --> 04:02.613
Well, maybe we should
just elope.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.748
Good idea.

04:04.682 --> 04:06.216
Lou:
Over my dead body.

04:06.283 --> 04:08.218
Look, you think
your first wedding was great?

04:08.285 --> 04:10.053
You just wait

05:29.761 --> 05:30.661
You gotta come see it!

05:30.729 --> 05:31.796
It's dirt cheap.

05:31.863 --> 05:33.031
The guy just wants
to get rid of it.

05:33.098 --> 05:35.199
Well, maybe 'cause
it doesn't run.

Ty: It's a classic;
It's a Norton!

05:37.369 --> 05:38.502
I can find parts
for it.

05:38.570 --> 05:40.638
I can fix it up.

05:41.472 --> 05:42.806
Come on,

05:42.873 --> 05:44.241
I know you don't know
a lot about motorcycles-

05:44.309 --> 05:47.044
Excuse me, I had motorcycles
from the time I could-

05:47.111 --> 05:49.346
you wanna know somethin'
about motorcycles,

05:49.414 --> 05:50.547
you ask me.

05:50.614 --> 05:53.650
So you get it!
It's a Norton!

05:53.717 --> 05:57.253
Well, I had a Triumph,
but a Norton's not bad.

05:57.321 --> 05:58.520
We can take a look
at it later.

05:58.588 --> 06:00.722
Or now.
Someone's gonna snap it up.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.224
I can't do now.

06:03.193 --> 06:04.827
Val's said she's got some news.

06:04.894 --> 06:06.895
She's coming over.

06:14.971 --> 06:16.972
Amy: I can't believe
you still have Kramer.

06:17.039 --> 06:18.873
You and Jake barely talk any more

06:18.941 --> 06:20.175
and he still lets you
ride his horse?

06:20.242 --> 06:22.610
Jake's like a little puppy,
he'll do anything for me.

06:22.678 --> 06:24.579
Yeah, well,
it isn't healthy.

06:24.796 --> 06:27.698
You know, you should put the poor guy
out of his own misery.

06:27.766 --> 06:29.066
Let him move on
with his life.

06:29.134 --> 06:31.201
Nobody's stopping him
from moving on.

06:31.269 --> 06:33.770
Uh, have you told him
about Badger?

06:33.838 --> 06:35.539
What's to know?
We just text.

06:35.607 --> 06:37.807
Yeah. And talk on the phone
for hours.

06:39.710 --> 06:42.146
(Laughs)
Well, you do!

06:44.682 --> 06:46.582
Ty: Hey, Val.
Val: Ty.

06:47.317 --> 06:48.451
See ya.

06:50.621 --> 06:53.289
Well, I've got good news.

06:54.291 --> 06:55.458
I just saw my doctor

06:55.526 --> 06:57.460
and he gave me
a clean bill of health.

06:57.528 --> 06:59.662
That's not good news...

06:59.729 --> 07:03.031
That's great news.
Great news.

07:03.098 --> 07:04.699
(Laughing)

07:04.767 --> 07:05.967
Oh, Jack.

07:06.035 --> 07:07.769
And you know what?

07:07.836 --> 07:08.836
Right there and then,
on the spot,

07:08.904 --> 07:10.405
I made a decision.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.640
From now on

07:11.707 --> 07:12.840
I'm gonna start
doing the things

07:12.908 --> 07:14.108
that I know,
without a doubt,

07:14.177 --> 07:15.477
make me happy.

07:15.545 --> 07:17.178
Things I have given up
or put on the side

07:17.245 --> 07:20.214
because of all the crazy stuff
that got in the way.

07:20.282 --> 07:21.482
Because you know
that old expression

07:21.550 --> 07:24.151
"Life is too short"?

07:24.219 --> 07:26.253
By God,
ain't it the truth?

07:26.321 --> 07:28.855
- Apparently so.
- Yeah.

07:28.923 --> 07:30.791
So, I've made me
a happy list.

07:30.858 --> 07:32.393
A happy list?

07:32.460 --> 07:35.027
And I know exactly
what I'm gonna do first.

07:35.095 --> 07:37.129
So you wanna get back
into show jumping?

07:37.198 --> 07:38.464
I do.

07:38.532 --> 07:40.333
I just bought a beautiful
jumping horse,

07:40.401 --> 07:43.002
and this time I'm the one
who's gonna ride it.

07:43.070 --> 07:44.604
Amy:
That's great.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.340
Val: (Laughing)
I saw that look on your face.

07:47.408 --> 07:48.575
But let me tell you,

07:48.642 --> 07:51.443
I used to be
pretty darn good.

07:51.511 --> 07:53.612
I set it aside
when I had my kids,

07:53.680 --> 07:55.714
but... well, I just feel
like it's time

07:55.781 --> 07:57.949
to get back
into that arena.

07:58.017 --> 08:00.151
So I'm gonna need
a coach.

08:00.220 --> 08:01.220
A coach?

08:01.287 --> 08:03.188
Mm-hm.
That's where you come in.

08:03.256 --> 08:04.623
But what about your
Briar Ridge Rainers?

08:04.691 --> 08:05.623
They're the best.

08:05.691 --> 08:06.824
(Laughs)

08:06.891 --> 08:08.192
No way am I gonna make
a fool of myself

08:08.260 --> 08:09.727
in front of those guys.

08:09.794 --> 08:12.496
No. They'd lose any respect
they have for me.

08:12.564 --> 08:13.997
I've even arranged for us
to use a private arena,

08:14.065 --> 08:15.499
by the way.

08:15.567 --> 08:18.302
So... what do you say,
coach?

08:20.706 --> 08:22.138
Ashley:
A nightmare.

08:22.206 --> 08:23.740
I love her, but she's gonna be
a total nightmare.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.275
Soraya:
Ashley...

08:25.343 --> 08:26.443
Ashley: I'm serious.
You shoulda just said no.

08:26.510 --> 08:28.144
Well, I couldn't.
She was so enthusiastic.

08:28.212 --> 08:29.912
She's got this
"happy list."

08:29.980 --> 08:31.080
Stop.

08:31.148 --> 08:32.849
I know all about
the "happy list."

08:32.916 --> 08:33.916
Happy list?

08:33.984 --> 08:35.284
It's just things
she wants to do

08:35.352 --> 08:36.318
that make her happy.

08:36.386 --> 08:37.486
Oh my God,
the next thing you know

08:37.554 --> 08:40.188
she'll enter into
the Jurassic classic.

08:40.256 --> 08:42.023
Soraya:
Jurassic classic?

08:42.091 --> 08:44.993
Ashley: It's a horse jumping
show for dinosaurs like my mother.

08:45.061 --> 08:47.129
I'm not making this up.

08:48.998 --> 08:50.465
Hey.

08:50.532 --> 08:51.900
Hey.

08:51.968 --> 08:54.302
Uh, everything back to normal
at your place?

08:54.370 --> 08:56.037
Yeah.
No more quarantine.

08:56.105 --> 08:58.740
Okay. Well then
I'd like to pick up Daisy.

08:58.808 --> 08:59.674
I have a rodeo
in a couple of weeks

08:59.742 --> 09:00.708
<i>and I need to practice.</i>

09:00.777 --> 09:02.077
Amy:
That's no problem.

09:02.145 --> 09:02.877
I actually had her out
on barrels the other day

09:02.944 --> 09:04.411
and she was awesome.

09:04.479 --> 09:06.380
Wow. Really?

09:06.447 --> 09:07.547
Yeah.

09:08.116 --> 09:09.083
Next thing I know,

09:09.151 --> 09:11.085
you'll be competing
against me.

09:13.421 --> 09:15.022
Ashley:
(Meows and hisses)

09:15.090 --> 09:16.023
Ashley.

09:16.091 --> 09:17.391
I was trying, okay?

09:17.458 --> 09:19.893
She makes it difficult.

09:23.147 --> 09:25.214
Todd: My wife's making
me get rid of it.

09:25.282 --> 09:29.085
Wants to reclaim the garage
for an office.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.420
I can't just give her away.

09:32.356 --> 09:34.890
The bike, I mean.
(Chuckles)

09:36.492 --> 09:38.360
Well, I'm not trying
to steal it from you, man.

09:38.428 --> 09:39.827
Then give me
a fair offer.

09:40.363 --> 09:43.698
You should be paying us
to take it away.

09:43.766 --> 09:44.999
Do you know what this bike
will be worth

09:45.068 --> 09:46.000
when it's fixed up?

09:46.069 --> 09:47.936
But it's not fixed up.

09:48.003 --> 09:48.903
Eight hundred bucks.

09:48.971 --> 09:50.038
What?

09:53.041 --> 09:54.775
No. No way.

09:54.842 --> 09:55.876
Eight fifty.

10:05.019 --> 10:11.324
("Born To Be Wild"
by Steppenwolf plays on radio)

10:11.392 --> 10:14.060
Jack and Ty: (Singing along)
♪ Like a true nature's child ♪

10:14.128 --> 10:15.295
Come on, Ty.

10:15.362 --> 10:17.163
♪ We were born,
born to be wild ♪

10:18.099 --> 10:19.365
♪ we can climb so high ♪

10:20.301 --> 10:22.102

10:23.036 --> 10:25.003

You know this part.

10:25.071 --> 10:28.574

10:28.641 --> 10:29.708
(Laughing)

10:32.112 --> 10:34.879
♪ Born to be wild ♪

10:39.918 --> 10:40.784
Grab that old ladder.

10:40.852 --> 10:41.919
That'll be a good ramp.

10:41.987 --> 10:43.221
Ty:
All right.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.994
That's the ticket.

10:51.930 --> 10:53.264
All right...

10:54.733 --> 10:56.065
Hey, careful.
Easy.

10:56.134 --> 10:58.768
You were right,
this is a real honey.

10:59.703 --> 11:01.104
All you do is find
a few parts for it,

11:01.172 --> 11:02.071
and she's gonna rock.

11:02.140 --> 11:03.206
Yeah.

11:05.376 --> 11:08.411
Stumpy used to be
a big Norton fan.

11:08.479 --> 11:09.946
Really?

11:10.014 --> 11:14.883
He had a whole string of them,
until he lost half his leg.

11:14.951 --> 11:18.854
I think he still got
a whole garage full of parts.

11:18.921 --> 11:20.222
Ninety percent of them junk,

11:20.290 --> 11:22.090
just like everything else
on that spread of his,

11:22.159 --> 11:24.760
but you never know
what we might find.

11:24.827 --> 11:25.894
There.

11:27.196 --> 11:28.263
Woo!

11:31.133 --> 11:32.200
What is that?

11:36.004 --> 11:38.439
Why would you spend money
on a motorcycle?

11:38.507 --> 11:40.608
It wasn't that much money,
and I got savings.

11:40.676 --> 11:42.743
Yeah.
For school, right?

11:45.713 --> 11:47.614
I'll let you figure this out
on your own.

11:51.452 --> 11:53.587
I'm steering clear of it.

12:00.860 --> 12:03.929
Ty: Look, Jack and I are
gonna work on it together.

12:03.997 --> 12:05.231
I miss my old bike, Amy.

12:05.299 --> 12:06.332
Amy:
Okay.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.801
Ty: There's nothing like tearing down
the highway on a motorcycle.

12:08.868 --> 12:10.269
It's total freedom.

12:10.337 --> 12:12.071
You can go anywhere,
anytime.

12:12.138 --> 12:13.038
Why, is this about
all the travelling

12:13.106 --> 12:15.040
you've missed out on?

12:15.108 --> 12:16.274
Maybe.

12:16.342 --> 12:18.009
Maybe I wanna go on
a little road trip.

12:18.077 --> 12:19.177
Oh, a road trip?

12:19.245 --> 12:21.446
Like with Caleb
to Great Falls?

12:21.514 --> 12:22.880
Yeah, it's possible.

12:22.948 --> 12:24.649
That's just,
that's a super idea, Ty.

12:24.717 --> 12:26.784
Especially since we just got out
from under a quarantine,

12:26.852 --> 12:28.152
<i>and we have to rebuild</i>
<i>the business-</i>

12:28.221 --> 12:30.121
hey. Hey, forget the road
trip then, all right?

12:30.189 --> 12:31.555
I'm just fixing up
an old bike.

12:31.623 --> 12:32.523
It's no big deal.

12:32.591 --> 12:33.824
Okay, okay,
but-

12:33.891 --> 12:36.227
I don't get why
I have to explain

12:36.294 --> 12:38.629
or defend this to you?

12:39.531 --> 12:40.331
I guess you don't.

12:40.398 --> 12:41.932
No, I don't.

12:47.371 --> 12:49.372
Oh my God,
look at this.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.840
A wedding planning guide.

12:50.907 --> 12:53.142
Things to do twelve months
before the wedding:

12:53.210 --> 12:55.177
Start looking for
a wedding consultant,

12:55.246 --> 12:56.846
book your venue,

12:56.913 --> 12:58.948
make a wedding organizer
out of - wait for it -

12:59.015 --> 13:01.183
<i>a three ring binder.</i>

13:01.252 --> 13:03.418
Wow, that took a lot
of creative thought.

13:03.486 --> 13:05.454
You laugh, but weddings
have to be thought out

13:05.521 --> 13:07.789
months in advance,
in minute detail.

13:07.857 --> 13:09.124
Okay. Your wedding
is in June,

13:09.191 --> 13:10.359
that's like ages away.

13:10.426 --> 13:13.128
You could have a baby
in that time.

13:13.195 --> 13:16.030
Not that you are,
but could.

13:16.098 --> 13:17.198
What is that for?

13:17.267 --> 13:19.300
Peter has a tiny break
in his schedule

13:19.368 --> 13:20.901
and we're meeting
a romantic picnic

13:20.969 --> 13:22.637
between Hudson
and Calgary.

13:22.704 --> 13:25.406
That's always nice -
a picnic on the highway.

13:25.474 --> 13:26.474
Not on the highway.

13:26.541 --> 13:29.076
A cute little town
with a park.

13:29.144 --> 13:30.878
Oh, look at this.

13:30.945 --> 13:34.682
I would love to do
something like this.

13:34.750 --> 13:35.882
Apparently,
Peter's first wedding

13:35.949 --> 13:38.685
was right out of one
of these magazines.

13:38.753 --> 13:40.453
It was written up
in the social pages

13:40.521 --> 13:42.121
of the Calgary newspapers.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.156
Yeah, and look what
happened to that -

13:43.223 --> 13:45.091
the big "d" for divorce.

13:45.159 --> 13:46.426
Why don't you guys
just elope?

13:46.494 --> 13:48.828
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

13:48.896 --> 13:50.563
I wonder where they held it?

13:50.631 --> 13:52.431
I wonder if she wore white?

13:53.966 --> 13:54.966
What?

13:55.034 --> 13:55.967
Okay,
you obviously have

13:56.035 --> 13:57.603
a morbidly gruesome
fascination

13:57.671 --> 13:58.737
with his first wedding.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.172
No, I don't.

14:00.239 --> 14:01.740
If you want me to,

14:01.808 --> 14:03.809
I can search for the newspaper
archives on the web

14:03.876 --> 14:06.545
and try and find
the articles.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.145
No.

14:08.213 --> 14:11.215
I would never stoop
that low.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.335
So, where did you
first get married?

14:14.402 --> 14:16.604
You want a cup of coffee
or something or...?

14:16.672 --> 14:17.805
You must be freezing.
Are you?

14:17.873 --> 14:19.106
No.

14:19.174 --> 14:20.274
So much for our picnic,
huh?

14:20.342 --> 14:22.142
Hey, we can still
have a picnic.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.543
It's cozier inside.

14:23.611 --> 14:25.278
Look at you.

14:25.346 --> 14:26.847
Seriously,
where'd you get married?

14:30.317 --> 14:31.284
Calgary.

14:31.352 --> 14:32.586
No, silly.
I mean where?

14:32.653 --> 14:35.321
In a church?
In a park?

14:36.390 --> 14:38.859
Ballroom.
Hotel ballroom.

14:40.293 --> 14:42.461
What did the bride wear?

14:42.529 --> 14:44.497
- A dress...
- What kind of dress?

14:44.564 --> 14:45.631
I don't know, Lou,

14:45.699 --> 14:46.499
it was white
and it was long.

14:46.566 --> 14:47.666
Look, honey,

14:47.734 --> 14:48.934
you gotta let this go,
okay?

14:49.002 --> 14:50.202
Yes, I was married
once before.

14:50.269 --> 14:52.037
There's nothing
I can do about it,

14:52.105 --> 14:53.772
but you have to stop
obsessing about it.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.740
I am not obsessing.
I'm not- yes you are.

14:55.808 --> 14:57.041
I'm just curious.

14:57.109 --> 14:58.376
It's not a wedding
competition, okay?

14:58.443 --> 15:02.179
What competition?
There is no competition.

15:02.247 --> 15:03.548
Okay. Okay.

15:04.483 --> 15:05.550
From now on,

15:05.618 --> 15:06.885
I'm not gonna obsess
over anything

15:06.952 --> 15:08.486
but our own plans.

15:08.554 --> 15:09.954
Good.

15:10.022 --> 15:11.922
Why don't we talk about
our honeymoon?

15:11.990 --> 15:14.958
You know,
we never did get to Paris.

15:15.026 --> 15:16.393
That's true.

15:16.460 --> 15:17.628
But you know what I've
been thinking about lately?

15:17.695 --> 15:19.930
What?
A cruise...

15:19.998 --> 15:22.399
Through the Greek islands
maybe.

15:22.466 --> 15:23.800
Santorini.

15:24.669 --> 15:26.570
You had you first honeymoon
in Paris, didn't you?

15:33.458 --> 15:35.191
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>That's looking good, Val.</i>

15:35.260 --> 15:38.094
Now, just make sure
you don't lean too far forward.

15:38.162 --> 15:39.896
I don't feel like
I'm leaning forward at all.

15:39.964 --> 15:42.132
Well, it's just 'cause
you're nervous.

15:42.199 --> 15:44.134
All right, just try and keep
your back a little straighter.

15:45.102 --> 15:46.802
- Good.
- Come on.

15:46.870 --> 15:48.237
You wanna be a little bit
more flexible.

15:48.305 --> 15:49.505
<i>(Laughs)</i>
<i>As in,</i>

15:49.573 --> 15:51.807
old age inflexibility
has taken hold?

15:51.875 --> 15:54.209
Well, it's more about being
one with your horse,

15:54.278 --> 15:56.145
being fluid.

15:56.212 --> 15:58.981
Val: Amy, I am moving
with my horse.

15:59.048 --> 16:01.083
It's all coming back.
It's like riding a bicycle.

16:09.292 --> 16:10.325
So? What's your big news

16:10.393 --> 16:12.260
that I had to rush over
to hear?

16:12.328 --> 16:13.728
I just got the email.

16:13.796 --> 16:15.029
What email?

16:15.097 --> 16:16.063
That rodeo in Great Falls?

16:16.131 --> 16:17.899
Yeah.
I qualified.

16:17.966 --> 16:19.099
I leave at the end
of the week.

16:19.167 --> 16:20.401
You're not serious.

16:20.468 --> 16:21.502
Of course, I'm serious.

16:21.569 --> 16:24.204
I stand to make
a lot of money.

16:24.306 --> 16:25.572
Oh, what's the problem,
baby?

16:25.640 --> 16:29.443
The problem is,
I don't want you to go.

16:35.982 --> 16:37.417
Caleb: Can you believe her
telling me not to enter?

16:37.484 --> 16:38.651
Where does that come from?

16:38.719 --> 16:39.786
Where does Amy get off
telling me

16:39.853 --> 16:41.120
I shouldn't have bought
this motorcycle?

16:41.188 --> 16:43.022
Heck, she even gave me a box
to keep my buckles in.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.391
Like it was her decision
to make, not mine.

16:45.459 --> 16:48.093
Do I tell her what she can
and can't buy? No.

16:48.161 --> 16:49.462
You know what?

16:49.530 --> 16:50.862
I can damn well go to that rodeo
if I want to.

16:50.930 --> 16:53.131
And I can damn well
come with you if I want to.

16:53.199 --> 16:55.534
- Yeah.
- On this baby right here, man!

16:55.601 --> 16:57.636
Are you sure she runs?

16:57.704 --> 16:59.705
No. But she will.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.374
(Bike clatters)

17:06.244 --> 17:08.646
Not yet,
but she will.

17:09.848 --> 17:11.181
I can't believe, Ty.

17:11.249 --> 17:12.583
You know, I think
he's actually planning

17:12.651 --> 17:14.117
on going to Montana
with Caleb,

17:14.185 --> 17:15.252
on that stupid bike.

17:15.319 --> 17:16.854
I mean,
what is he thinking?

17:16.921 --> 17:18.356
My mom says
it's the full moon.

17:18.423 --> 17:19.357
People go mental.

17:19.424 --> 17:20.825
(Phone rings)

17:22.859 --> 17:23.925
Mallory.

17:24.161 --> 17:24.926
Hey! You!

17:26.930 --> 17:29.165
You gonna answer it?

17:30.100 --> 17:31.401
Jake.

17:31.469 --> 17:33.403
This is like the third time
he's called me today.

17:33.471 --> 17:34.471
He's always phoning me.

17:34.538 --> 17:36.172
He never has anything
to say.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.107
He always just talks
about nothing.

17:38.175 --> 17:39.842
And he sends me songs...

17:39.909 --> 17:41.943
Amy:
That's kind of sweet.

17:42.011 --> 17:43.379
No, it's not.

17:43.446 --> 17:46.782
They're always about
broken-hearted cowboys.

17:46.850 --> 17:47.916
(Sighs)

17:49.018 --> 17:51.754
So what is this between
you and Ty?

17:51.821 --> 17:54.256
If it's about the motorcycle,
you shouldn't worry.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.556
Right.

17:55.624 --> 17:56.957
I'm serious.

17:57.025 --> 17:58.025
Have you took a close look
at the thing?

17:58.093 --> 17:58.826
They're never gonna
make it run

17:58.894 --> 18:00.160
in like a million years.

18:01.062 --> 18:02.296
With any luck.

18:07.770 --> 18:10.937
So, how're the plans coming?

18:11.005 --> 18:12.205
Fine.

18:12.273 --> 18:14.007
Just "fine"?

18:14.074 --> 18:15.141
Let's put it this way.

18:15.209 --> 18:16.743
"My" wedding plans
are fine.

18:16.811 --> 18:17.878
It's the "us"
wedding plans

18:17.945 --> 18:20.313
that have hit
a bit of a snag.

18:20.381 --> 18:23.650
But it's nothing
I can't handle.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.386
Ty:
You got it?

18:26.453 --> 18:28.186
Amy:
Yeah. Thank you.

18:28.254 --> 18:29.354
Ty:
See you.

18:30.757 --> 18:32.958
Are you guys
fighting?

18:37.781 --> 18:38.881
What?

18:39.615 --> 18:41.150
Why did you go along
with it?

18:41.217 --> 18:42.584
You know how dangerous
motorcycles are.

18:42.652 --> 18:44.418
They don't call donorcycles
for nothing.

18:44.486 --> 18:46.688
And you're encouraging him.
Why?

18:46.755 --> 18:48.790
He's been through
a lot lately and-

18:48.857 --> 18:50.524
Oh, I know, Grandpa,
but...

18:50.592 --> 18:51.525
Look, Amy...

18:54.563 --> 18:57.799
He needs to deal with
whatever he's dealing with,

18:57.866 --> 19:00.967
and if that means he wants
to rebuild an old motorcycle,

19:01.035 --> 19:03.603
well, it could be a lot worse.

19:04.605 --> 19:07.874
And besides, this is a project
that we can work on together.

19:09.677 --> 19:11.745
He's not foolhardy, Amy.

19:12.279 --> 19:13.346
Yeah. Okay.

Ashley was right,
I should've just said no.

Hey.

20:18.743 --> 20:20.442
- This is Chelsea.
- Hi.

20:21.578 --> 20:22.378
I tried to call you
on your phone,

20:22.445 --> 20:24.246
but you didn't pick up.

20:24.314 --> 20:25.714
I lost it.

20:26.416 --> 20:28.049
Hey, are you still jumping
with Kramer?

20:28.117 --> 20:29.151
Yeah.

20:29.218 --> 20:30.619
Great.
'Cause if you don't mind,

20:30.687 --> 20:32.821
I'd lik to borrow him back
in the next couple of days.

20:32.889 --> 20:34.022
<i>Chelsea really wants</i>
<i>to learn to jump</i>

20:34.090 --> 20:35.690
and I figure Kramer's
the perfect horse

20:35.758 --> 20:37.057
for her to start on.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.760
Especially now that
you've shown him the ropes.

20:38.827 --> 20:41.429
Yeah.
I mean...

20:41.497 --> 20:43.097
<i>I don't see why not.</i>

20:43.165 --> 20:44.565
He's your horse.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.367
Great.

20:46.435 --> 20:48.135
I'll call you when
I'm comin' to get him.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.771
Bye, Mallory.
So nice to meet you.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.543
Oh my God,
he has a girlfriend?!

20:56.611 --> 20:58.445
I thought you were
over him?

20:58.513 --> 20:59.579
I am.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.284
What?
Where you goin'?

21:04.352 --> 21:05.719
I thought you were
going to jump?

21:05.787 --> 21:07.453
I don't feel like it.

21:11.358 --> 21:13.392
Amy:
Okay, that looks good,

21:13.460 --> 21:14.860
but why don't you drop
your stirrups?

21:14.928 --> 21:16.462
You're still a little tense,

21:16.530 --> 21:18.597
and that way you can relax
into the saddle a bit more.

21:18.665 --> 21:20.032
No stirrups?

21:20.099 --> 21:21.500
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Just give it a try.</i>

21:21.568 --> 21:22.601
Val:
No. I tried it.

21:22.669 --> 21:24.035
I don't like it.
It's weird.

21:24.102 --> 21:25.470
Okay. All right.

21:25.538 --> 21:27.238
Um, why don't we try
something different?

21:27.306 --> 21:29.407
Put one hand on the reins

21:29.475 --> 21:31.108
and one hand behind
your back.

21:31.176 --> 21:34.111
Amy, I'm not training to be
a trick rider, you know.

21:34.179 --> 21:35.246
Okay.

21:36.849 --> 21:38.350
<i>Let's try something else then.</i>

21:39.551 --> 21:41.251
<i>Val:</i>
<i>Hey, Jack.</i>

21:41.319 --> 21:44.421
Look, just let me do it
my way, okay?

21:45.423 --> 21:48.158
Jack: Just thought I'd drop in,
see how you guys are doin'.

21:48.226 --> 21:50.927
<i>Val:</i>
<i>Back in the saddle.</i>

21:50.995 --> 21:52.329
Looking good!

21:52.397 --> 21:54.631
Val:
Yeah? Watch this!

21:54.699 --> 21:56.065
Val: Come on, boy!
Amy: No, Val!

21:56.132 --> 21:57.700
Val:
Come on! Come on!

21:57.768 --> 21:59.201
Val, stop it!

21:59.269 --> 22:00.202
Val!

22:00.270 --> 22:01.904
(Fence clatters)
Val: Oh!

22:02.973 --> 22:04.173
(Pained groans)
Jack: Val!

22:04.241 --> 22:05.441
Grandpa!

22:05.509 --> 22:06.709
You all right?

22:06.777 --> 22:08.110
(Pained groans)

22:09.413 --> 22:11.913
I'm fine.
No broken bones.

22:11.981 --> 22:14.983
Haven't had that happen
in a while.

22:18.020 --> 22:21.155
God, maybe I should pass
on this idea,

22:21.657 --> 22:23.358
move down the happy list.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.293
Try to learn to paint
with water colours.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.028
<i>Let's go again.</i>

22:28.963 --> 22:31.231
Well, you gotta hand it
to her for trying.

22:35.570 --> 22:37.037
Okay. So...

22:38.172 --> 22:42.676
Purple orchids, white roses,
and hydrangeas...

22:43.611 --> 22:44.844
Or should we go into
the pinks and yellows?

22:44.912 --> 22:46.413
I don't know.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.382
Because purple might be
too heavy a colour for June.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.317
What do you think?

22:51.385 --> 22:52.685
I...
(Clears throat)

22:52.753 --> 22:54.120
Honestly have no idea,
sweetheart.

22:54.187 --> 22:56.890
I just...
Tell me where we're going,

22:56.957 --> 22:58.792
what I should be wearing,
and what time to show up.

22:58.859 --> 22:59.892
It'll be fine.

22:59.959 --> 23:02.327
This is our wedding,
okay?

23:02.395 --> 23:04.095
Not "my" wedding,

23:04.163 --> 23:05.931
and I want you to be
a part of it, so...

23:05.998 --> 23:07.399
Lucky Peter.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.301
I know, right?

23:09.368 --> 23:10.436
Wow.

23:10.503 --> 23:12.137
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>I know. I know.</i>

23:12.204 --> 23:14.506
<i>Can you just picture that</i>
<i>at the dude ranch?</i>

23:14.574 --> 23:17.041
You've got one tent
for the reception,

23:17.108 --> 23:18.676
one for the hors d'oeuvres
and champagne,

23:18.744 --> 23:20.711
and one for the ceremony.

23:20.779 --> 23:21.946
I've called three companies

23:22.013 --> 23:23.147
but they're totally
stonewalling me,

23:23.214 --> 23:24.449
saying they just have
standard tents,

23:24.516 --> 23:25.683
no pinnacles.

23:25.751 --> 23:27.284
But the pinnacles
are what makes it.

23:27.352 --> 23:28.986
Yeah, the pinnacles.
Of course, I mean...

23:29.054 --> 23:31.088
Absolutely.
I mean, what do you...

23:32.022 --> 23:33.590
Lou:
Ha ha.

23:33.658 --> 23:35.258
Talk about bridezilla.

23:35.326 --> 23:38.127
I am not a bridezilla, okay?

23:38.195 --> 23:39.963
God, can I not enjoy
this time?

23:40.030 --> 23:42.098
It's special for me.

23:42.366 --> 23:43.867
You know, I've never been
married before,

23:43.934 --> 23:45.234
I've never been engaged,

23:45.302 --> 23:47.003
and it's new and exciting -

23:47.071 --> 23:48.771
for me anyways.

23:48.838 --> 23:50.005
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Meaning it's not to me.</i>

23:50.073 --> 23:51.807
(Clears throat)

23:51.875 --> 23:53.042
Okay. See you.

23:59.215 --> 24:01.717
No contest, right?
You're hilarious.

24:01.785 --> 24:04.285
I only meant that
I want our wedding

24:04.352 --> 24:06.387
to be the one
that you remember the most.

24:06.454 --> 24:07.789
Well, sweetheart,
that won't be hard

24:07.856 --> 24:09.423
because my first one
was a complete blur.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.892
Well, no wonder,
you know.

24:10.959 --> 24:12.927
"She" obviously took over
and you showed up

24:12.995 --> 24:15.396
like an invited guest.

24:16.799 --> 24:19.300
I want our wedding to be...

24:19.367 --> 24:22.302
I want it to be our day,
from start to finish.

24:22.369 --> 24:26.539
And I want it to run
like a well-oiled machine.

24:26.607 --> 24:28.308
Well-oiled machine.

24:28.375 --> 24:31.444
Sounds just incredibly romantic.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.913
It will be.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.151
Jack:
She's looking good.

24:39.219 --> 24:40.485
Ty:
Yeah.

24:40.553 --> 24:43.322
Can't wait to get this baby
on the open road.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.193
Always wanted to ride
my Triumph

24:47.260 --> 24:49.862
from Hudson to San Diego,

24:50.764 --> 24:53.865
take all the old highways
and back roads.

24:53.933 --> 24:55.100
Never got around to it.
Maybe someday.

24:57.669 --> 24:58.737
Amy:
Hey.

25:01.340 --> 25:02.540
Ty:
Hey.

25:02.608 --> 25:04.442
Let me get that
wrench we need.

25:06.511 --> 25:08.646
Look, I don't want this to be
a thing between us, all right.

25:08.714 --> 25:10.548
No, me neither.

25:10.616 --> 25:12.550
There's just something
I need to get off my chest.

25:12.618 --> 25:14.218
Okay. Tell me.

25:14.286 --> 25:16.119
(Truck approaches)

25:16.186 --> 25:18.221
Totally forgot about Daisy
getting picked up today.

25:18.289 --> 25:20.823
Kit: Oh my God!
It's a Norton, isn't it?

25:20.891 --> 25:22.559
Yeah.

25:22.627 --> 25:24.093
Kit: So cool!
When did you get it?

25:24.161 --> 25:25.161
Just a few days ago.

25:25.229 --> 25:26.796
- No way.
- Yeah.

25:26.864 --> 25:28.197
Nice.

25:28.266 --> 25:30.032
Hey, my brother had a Norton.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.234
- He probably has some parts.
- Really?

25:32.302 --> 25:33.469
Yeah.

25:33.536 --> 25:34.903
You should come over
and check it out.

25:34.971 --> 25:36.171
Awesome!

25:36.239 --> 25:37.606
Uh, Kit,
I'm gonna grab your horse.

25:37.674 --> 25:39.908
<i>Kit:</i> <i>Oh yeah. Yeah.</i>
<i>Great. Thanks.</i>

25:40.476 --> 25:43.145
It's gonna be so fantastic
when you fix it all up.

25:43.951 --> 25:44.919
Beautiful!

25:45.151 --> 25:47.419
Hey, so...
Caleb tells me

25:47.422 --> 25:49.590
that you're going down
to Great Falls with him.

25:49.657 --> 25:50.924
I entered too.

25:50.993 --> 25:52.359
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.759
It's gonna be
so much fun.

25:53.827 --> 25:55.495
They party so hard
down there.

25:57.031 --> 25:58.931
Hey, there's my girl.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.400
She looks great.

26:02.870 --> 26:04.037
Thanks for everything
you done for her.

26:04.105 --> 26:05.738
Amy:
Oh, no problem.

26:05.807 --> 26:06.807
Kit: I probably wouldn't
be competing on her again,

26:06.874 --> 26:08.007
<i>if it weren't for you.</i>

26:11.178 --> 26:13.779
So hey, let me know
when you wanna come over.

26:13.847 --> 26:14.880
We'll hang out.

26:14.948 --> 26:15.714
I'll make sure
my brother's there.

26:15.782 --> 26:16.648
- Yeah?
- Awesome.

26:16.716 --> 26:18.284
Such a great bike.

26:20.420 --> 26:22.688
Hey.
You wanna talk?

26:23.623 --> 26:24.588
What's there
to talk about?

26:24.656 --> 26:27.725
It's obviously
a "great bike."

26:30.696 --> 26:31.830
(Phone rings)

26:32.298 --> 26:33.664
Ugh, it's my mother.

26:33.732 --> 26:36.634
She just learned to text
and now she won't stop.

26:36.702 --> 26:37.936
It was on her list.

26:38.003 --> 26:39.270
What list?

26:39.338 --> 26:40.337
Forget it.

26:40.404 --> 26:41.705
Anyway,
she wants to know

26:41.772 --> 26:43.106
if you want to come over
for dinner on Saturday.

26:43.174 --> 26:44.574
This Saturday?

26:44.642 --> 26:46.343
Sorry, can't.

26:46.410 --> 26:47.444
Why not?

26:47.511 --> 26:49.146
I'll be in Montana.

26:49.214 --> 26:50.848
Oh, the rodeo.

26:51.782 --> 26:53.383
You're going?

26:53.451 --> 26:55.918
Look, Ash, I know you worry,
but...

26:55.986 --> 26:58.020
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
I'll be fine.

26:58.088 --> 26:59.788
I'm not worried about you
getting hurt.

26:59.857 --> 27:01.557
Heck, I use to do
show jumping for years.

27:01.624 --> 27:04.026
<i>People can get maimed</i>
<i>or killed doing that.</i>

27:04.094 --> 27:05.527
Well, then what is it?
What do you hate about it?

27:05.595 --> 27:07.163
It's the stupid "lifestyle."

27:07.231 --> 27:08.731
I mean, "Josh brought
his girlfriend along."

27:08.798 --> 27:09.732
Oh, what an idiot."

27:09.799 --> 27:11.100
Oh, come on!

27:11.168 --> 27:13.301
No! If you think
I'm just gonna wait around

27:13.369 --> 27:14.635
like some buckle bunny

27:14.703 --> 27:16.137
for you to finish
partying...

27:16.205 --> 27:17.505
I didn't even ask you to come.

27:17.573 --> 27:18.606
Exactly.

27:18.674 --> 27:20.108
You asked Ty.
Even better.

27:20.176 --> 27:22.377
Then I'm confused.
What is it?

27:22.444 --> 27:23.511
Well, you know what?
If you don't know,

27:23.579 --> 27:24.880
I can't help you.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.814
Okay, you know what, Ash?

27:26.883 --> 27:28.648
You're being unfair.

27:29.851 --> 27:31.118
<i>You know this is what I do.</i>

27:31.186 --> 27:33.687
You know it's how
I make a living.

27:34.589 --> 27:35.856
I'm going.

27:35.924 --> 27:38.058
Well, then... we're done.

27:42.430 --> 27:43.563
Unbelievable.

27:49.703 --> 27:50.937
So I'm heading out
later today.

27:51.005 --> 27:52.872
You still gonna come
to Montana?

27:52.940 --> 27:56.745
Uh... I can't get her working
the way I want her to yet.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.880
I can't come
for the whole rodeo.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.282
Yeah.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.718
Yeah. Well,
Jack would kill me.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.386
Caleb:
Jack?

28:08.454 --> 28:10.888
Someone else might
beat him to it, but...

28:10.956 --> 28:12.324
See I gotta be back
in a few of days

28:12.391 --> 28:13.791
and the only way
I can do that

28:13.859 --> 28:15.727
is if I get this baby runnin'.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.128
Why don't you take
your truck?

28:17.195 --> 28:20.297
Uh...

28:20.365 --> 28:22.399
Uh...

28:22.467 --> 28:24.535
Yeah,
I guess I could.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.637
It ain't transportation
we're talking about here, buddy.

28:26.704 --> 28:28.172
It's women.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.308
There's always gonna be
another time,

28:31.376 --> 28:33.643
and another circuit, right?

28:33.710 --> 28:35.077
Sorry, man.

28:35.146 --> 28:36.479
Another time.

28:36.547 --> 28:38.281
Don't think I didn't
get hassled too, huh?

28:42.819 --> 28:44.354
- Hey!
- Hey!

28:44.421 --> 28:46.489
What're you doing back?

28:47.424 --> 28:49.057
Hey, I gotta show you
this cake topper,

28:49.125 --> 28:50.159
- it's so...
- Hey, actually...

28:50.226 --> 28:51.960
Can it just hold on
a second?

28:52.028 --> 28:54.563
Um... I need to talk to you
for a minute.

28:54.631 --> 28:55.564
Sure.

28:55.632 --> 28:56.898
Okay, what's up?

28:56.966 --> 29:01.270
I'm kind of having
some flashbacks here.

29:01.337 --> 29:02.371
Flashbacks?

29:02.438 --> 29:05.473
Yeah,
to my first wedding.

29:05.541 --> 29:09.277
Um, it's not a good feeling,
you know,

29:09.344 --> 29:10.911
sorta the whole past
and present

29:10.979 --> 29:12.680
kind of colliding.

29:12.747 --> 29:14.382
What're you talking about?

29:14.449 --> 29:16.651
Um...
Well, here's the thing.

29:16.718 --> 29:18.553
I'm going out of town
for a couple of days

29:18.620 --> 29:20.020
to meet some clients, right?

29:20.088 --> 29:21.621
And uh...

29:21.689 --> 29:24.291
And I think in the end
it's probably a good thing

29:24.358 --> 29:25.758
because um...

29:25.826 --> 29:26.893
Because...

29:28.196 --> 29:29.563
Because I think
I need some time

29:29.630 --> 29:33.099
to think this
whole wedding thing through.

29:33.167 --> 29:34.467
Wedding thing?

29:34.535 --> 29:37.035
Yeah. And, you know,
you can do the same.

29:37.103 --> 29:38.304
You know,
take this time

29:38.371 --> 29:40.472
just to sorta
think things through

29:40.540 --> 29:44.142
and just let me know
what you really want.

29:44.211 --> 29:46.579
Well, it's not just about
what I want.

29:46.646 --> 29:48.647
What do you want?

29:48.715 --> 29:50.182
Well, I don't know
what I want.

29:50.250 --> 29:53.719
I mean, that's kinda
the whole problem, you know?

29:53.786 --> 29:56.188
So that's why we should just
take these next couple of days

29:56.255 --> 29:59.324
and just think things
through.

30:01.094 --> 30:03.328
I don't know what I'm supposed
to be thinking about.

30:03.395 --> 30:06.131
I mean, everything.
You know, you and I.

30:06.199 --> 30:08.233
The wedding.
Marriage.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.666
You know,
what it all means.

30:09.735 --> 30:13.170
If we even need to do it
at all, you know?

30:13.238 --> 30:14.739
Just think about it.

30:14.806 --> 30:15.873
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:17.075 --> 30:18.709
See you soon.

30:22.848 --> 30:23.881
(Exhales)

30:25.916 --> 30:27.050
I've ruined everything!

30:27.118 --> 30:28.517
What's wrong?

30:28.585 --> 30:29.585
Peter's having second thoughts
about the wedding

30:29.653 --> 30:30.653
and it's all my fault.

30:30.721 --> 30:31.687
Slow down.
Lou...

30:31.756 --> 30:33.189
No. I'm an idiot.

30:33.257 --> 30:34.991
Lou...

30:35.059 --> 30:36.392
I should never have
gone down that road,

30:36.460 --> 30:37.794
but I just couldn't
help myself.

30:37.862 --> 30:39.295
What road?

30:39.363 --> 30:40.763
I just couldn't stop thinking
about his first one.

30:40.830 --> 30:41.830
First what?

30:41.898 --> 30:44.599
Wedding! Wedding!
Wedding!

30:52.208 --> 30:53.242
Why?

30:55.912 --> 31:00.281
Because when he's watching me
come down that aisle,

31:00.348 --> 31:01.515
is he gonna be
looking at me

31:01.583 --> 31:04.051
or is he gonna be
remembering her?

31:04.119 --> 31:05.186
You.

31:05.988 --> 31:08.156
He's gonna be
seeing you.

31:08.223 --> 31:10.591
You gotta get over this
whole first wife thing,

31:10.659 --> 31:11.659
okay?

31:11.726 --> 31:13.126
Peter's been divorced
for years.

31:13.194 --> 31:15.262
You're the one
he wants to marry.

31:15.329 --> 31:17.030
You think?

31:17.098 --> 31:18.564
Are you nuts?

31:18.632 --> 31:19.800
Maybe.

31:19.867 --> 31:21.301
Definitely morbidly
obsessive.

31:21.368 --> 31:24.003
That's what Mallory
calls it.

31:24.070 --> 31:25.805
I'm losing it.

31:26.707 --> 31:27.774
Yeah.

31:30.711 --> 31:34.380
It's okay,
I think I'm losing it, too.

31:34.915 --> 31:37.148
I'm turning into this whole
control freak girlfriend

31:37.216 --> 31:41.553
and I just really hate the idea
of this motorcycle.

31:44.023 --> 31:46.090
And I know...
I know it's ridiculous,

31:46.158 --> 31:47.992
but it worries me.

31:48.060 --> 31:50.462
It's not ridiculous, okay?

31:50.530 --> 31:52.063
You know Ty's been
through a lot,

31:52.131 --> 31:53.998
but you, you haven't come out
of this whole crash thing

31:54.066 --> 31:56.367
unscathed either,
you know.

31:56.435 --> 31:58.602
And that motorcycle makes him
vulnerable in two ways:

31:58.670 --> 31:59.637
It's dangerous

31:59.705 --> 32:00.671
and it can take him
on the road

32:00.739 --> 32:02.807
away from you.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.108
Am I right?

32:04.176 --> 32:06.144
You might be.

32:06.212 --> 32:07.712
How can I be so smart
about your problems

32:07.779 --> 32:10.580
and totally suck
at my own?

32:17.488 --> 32:20.390
Amy: Okay.
Now drop your stirrups.

32:20.458 --> 32:21.825
Good job.

32:21.893 --> 32:24.661
<i>And ride right back</i>
<i>to the back wall.</i>

32:24.729 --> 32:28.797
Yeah. Now put your arms out
and close your eyes.

32:30.667 --> 32:31.901
Good. Okay.

32:31.969 --> 32:33.035
Now put one hand
on the reins

32:33.103 --> 32:35.671
and one hand
behind your back.

32:38.275 --> 32:39.742
I think you're ready
to try a jump.

32:39.809 --> 32:42.010
Val: I don't know...
I'm kind of I'm scared.

32:42.078 --> 32:43.711
You'll be fine.

32:43.779 --> 32:46.414
<i>Good...</i>
<i>Now turn sharp.</i>

32:46.482 --> 32:47.448
Perfect.

32:47.516 --> 32:48.984
Come on.
Come on.

32:49.886 --> 32:51.152
<i>Come on.</i>

32:54.673 --> 32:57.674
That was beautiful!
Keep going.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.447
Good for you!

33:03.515 --> 33:05.215
Val:
Oh man, oh man.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.584
Oh Jack,

33:07.652 --> 33:09.419
you know that
list of mine?

33:09.487 --> 33:11.688
Yeah.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.656
You are so on it.

33:18.795 --> 33:20.196
(Car rumbles up)

33:26.436 --> 33:28.538
So, you're really going?

33:28.605 --> 33:29.837
Great.

33:29.905 --> 33:31.573
Is Ty going with you?

33:31.641 --> 33:33.542
No. He bailed on me.

33:33.609 --> 33:35.210
Really.

33:35.278 --> 33:37.479
So aren't you gonna ask me?

33:37.547 --> 33:39.414
Ask you what?

33:39.482 --> 33:41.082
If I can go with you.

33:41.450 --> 33:43.618
Why? You hate the rodeo.

33:44.953 --> 33:47.321
Someone needs to protect you
from all those buckle bunnies,

33:47.389 --> 33:48.822
and...

33:48.890 --> 33:50.424
I know I should probably be
a little more supportive

33:50.492 --> 33:51.592
of what you do,
you know?

33:51.660 --> 33:53.994
So... can I come?

33:55.763 --> 33:56.763
Caleb:
You can't come.

33:56.831 --> 33:58.165
Ashley:
Why not?!

33:59.133 --> 34:00.601
You just,
you can't be there.

34:00.669 --> 34:02.034
Right.
Girlfriends aren't allowed.

34:02.102 --> 34:04.604
It would interfere
with the "lifestyle."

34:04.672 --> 34:06.306
It has nothing to do
with that.

34:06.373 --> 34:07.473
Right.

34:07.541 --> 34:09.475
No, really.
It's just that...

34:09.543 --> 34:10.810
Just what?

34:10.877 --> 34:11.811
It's just
I know this sounds stupid,

34:11.878 --> 34:13.846
but it's bad luck.

34:13.914 --> 34:15.014
Sure.

34:15.081 --> 34:16.683
Look, the last time
I brought a girl,

34:16.750 --> 34:19.284
I lost like every event.

34:19.351 --> 34:21.420
So I'll see you
when I get back.

34:21.487 --> 34:23.222
Maybe I won't be here.

34:23.289 --> 34:25.424
I hope you will be.

34:26.125 --> 34:27.259
Ashley...

34:29.762 --> 34:31.896
Ashley, come on.

34:31.964 --> 34:35.032
Ashley, come on.
Be reasonable.

34:39.154 --> 34:40.588
(Groans)

34:41.154 --> 34:43.588
I am gonna hurt tomorrow.

34:43.656 --> 34:46.190
But I gotta tell you,
that was a total thrill.

34:46.259 --> 34:47.424
You see?
The minute you relaxed,

34:47.492 --> 34:49.393
you were totally into it.

34:49.460 --> 34:52.529
Thank you for being
so patient with me.

34:52.597 --> 34:56.300
I mean, I knew exactly what you meant
about being more fluid.

34:56.969 --> 35:00.004
I was tensing before,
I admit it.

35:00.072 --> 35:02.006
I guess I was a bit scared.

35:02.074 --> 35:03.940
You got over it, right?

35:04.008 --> 35:06.376
And tomorrow you'll be
even better.

35:06.443 --> 35:08.344
It makes me
realize something.

35:08.412 --> 35:11.915
You just...
You just can't be afraid.

35:11.983 --> 35:13.817
I mean, you can't always
avoid taking risks

35:13.885 --> 35:15.718
or getting hurt.

35:15.787 --> 35:18.388
You just gotta throw yourself
into life

35:18.455 --> 35:20.756
or it goes by

35:20.824 --> 35:21.723
and you never get
another chance

35:21.792 --> 35:23.458
to grab it again.

35:26.562 --> 35:27.696
(Car rumbles to a stop)

35:30.834 --> 35:32.268
Val:
What's Ashley doing here?

35:37.206 --> 35:38.106
What's up?!

35:38.174 --> 35:39.274
Ashley:
Caleb!

35:39.341 --> 35:41.075
I'm just so furious
with him.

35:41.143 --> 35:42.911
I told him not to go
to that stupid rodeo

35:42.978 --> 35:44.312
and he went anyways.

35:44.379 --> 35:45.513
And then, when I offered
to go with him,

35:45.580 --> 35:47.882
he got all crazy
and superstitious.

35:47.950 --> 35:50.351
Oh...

35:50.419 --> 35:52.953
Why does he have to be
such a jerk?

35:53.021 --> 35:55.189
Val:
I have a question.

35:55.256 --> 35:57.291
What do you really
want to do?

35:57.358 --> 35:58.458
What do you mean?

35:58.526 --> 36:00.093
I mean, what's making you
more unhappy?

36:00.161 --> 36:01.695
The fact that he's gone off
to the rodeo

36:01.762 --> 36:04.898
or the fact that he didn't
want you to go with him?

36:04.966 --> 36:07.967
That he didn't want me
to go with him.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.002
What're you waiting
for then?

36:10.070 --> 36:12.939
Prove his silly
superstition wrong.

36:13.006 --> 36:14.673
You think?

36:14.741 --> 36:16.876
Val:
You go with your cowboy.

36:16.944 --> 36:18.211
Ashley:
Oh my God.

36:18.278 --> 36:20.079
I'm really gonna do this.

36:20.147 --> 36:21.747
(Giggling)

36:21.815 --> 36:23.114
Amy:
Good luck.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.550
See you.

36:31.891 --> 36:32.958
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.625
Okay.
Thank you.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.531
Mallory: Jake just called.
He's coming to get Kramer.

36:41.599 --> 36:42.900
I hope he doesn't
bring that girl.

36:49.975 --> 36:53.577
I think we should start
our own happy list.

37:00.017 --> 37:01.184
(Car rumbles)

37:10.794 --> 37:11.826
Hey.

37:12.928 --> 37:13.995
Hey.

37:14.964 --> 37:16.798
I came to get Kramer.

37:16.865 --> 37:19.667
Yeah, uh...
He's ready to go.

37:20.736 --> 37:22.670
Did you find
your phone?

37:22.738 --> 37:24.306
Yeah, I did.

37:25.874 --> 37:28.342
We haven't talked
in awhile.

37:29.277 --> 37:31.044
What've you been
doing?

37:31.113 --> 37:33.380
Uh, nothing much.
Working...

37:33.448 --> 37:35.448
Learning to jump...

37:35.516 --> 37:37.584
You seeing anyone?

37:38.519 --> 37:41.855
Seeing anyone?
Um... sort of.

37:43.157 --> 37:46.259
Yeah.
He's in the city.

37:46.327 --> 37:47.393
Oh...

37:48.429 --> 37:49.862
I mean we text,

37:50.797 --> 37:54.366
but we don't see
each other... much.

37:55.669 --> 37:57.003
Are you?

37:58.772 --> 38:00.439
You seeing anyone?

38:00.507 --> 38:02.041
Sort of...

38:02.109 --> 38:03.009
Chelsea?

38:04.811 --> 38:06.210
It's kind of weird...

38:06.278 --> 38:08.613
Isn't that like a bun
or something?

38:08.681 --> 38:11.349
I don't know.
I guess so.

38:12.752 --> 38:14.152
Okay. Well...

38:14.954 --> 38:18.222
You can go get Kramer.
He's just over there.

38:18.290 --> 38:19.958
Right. It's a good thing
he's not in the paddock,

38:20.026 --> 38:22.492
he might jump the fence
and escape.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.861
(Chuckles)
Remember that?

38:23.928 --> 38:24.995
Yeah.

38:29.768 --> 38:31.268
So, how was your trip?

38:31.335 --> 38:33.137
Hey! Uh... good.
Good.

38:33.204 --> 38:34.071
It was good.

38:34.139 --> 38:35.505
Where were you this time?

38:35.573 --> 38:37.807
Uh, Fort Mac.

38:37.875 --> 38:39.408
The oil sands.

38:39.476 --> 38:41.343
Now there's a place
that's...

38:41.411 --> 38:43.046
Chock full of pros
and cons...

38:47.517 --> 38:49.952
That I'd like to discuss
with you sometime.

38:53.490 --> 38:54.556
(Both chuckle)

38:55.992 --> 38:58.393
So, what should we do?

38:59.595 --> 39:01.730
Well, I've been thinking
a lot about it -

39:01.798 --> 39:03.098
even though
I wasn't really sure

39:03.166 --> 39:04.599
what I was supposed
to be thinking about -

39:04.667 --> 39:07.736
and I've come
to a conclusion.

39:09.438 --> 39:11.138
We should elope.

39:11.206 --> 39:12.306
- Elope?
- Yes.

39:12.373 --> 39:13.640
No wedding.
None of that.

39:14.209 --> 39:15.976
Just me and you
on a beautiful trip

39:16.044 --> 39:18.445
to the Greek islands,
Timbuktu...

39:18.513 --> 39:20.147
I don't care,

39:20.215 --> 39:21.515
as long as I'm with you.

39:21.783 --> 39:22.816
Okay.

39:22.884 --> 39:24.751
Well,
I've been thinking too.

39:24.819 --> 39:26.252
Oh, great.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.787
Yeah. And uh...

39:28.755 --> 39:31.190
I don't wanna elope.

39:31.258 --> 39:33.259
You know, the thing is,

39:33.327 --> 39:35.494
I been thinking about it
and...

39:35.562 --> 39:36.862
I mean, I think
we should just...

39:36.931 --> 39:39.966
Okay. Yeah.
I guess I saw that coming.

39:40.034 --> 39:41.801
What?

39:41.868 --> 39:45.170
Lou, I'm just looking forward
to a wedding.

39:45.238 --> 39:46.871
What? Really?

39:47.941 --> 39:49.107
Yeah.

39:49.175 --> 39:52.610
You know,
friends and family and...

39:53.246 --> 39:54.313
Tents?

39:54.747 --> 39:56.281
(Laughs)

39:56.349 --> 39:57.715
Yeah, and tents,

39:58.616 --> 40:01.385
with or without pinnacles.

40:07.426 --> 40:08.525
(Laughing)

40:14.731 --> 40:16.799
The bike looks great.

40:16.867 --> 40:18.501
Ty:
Okay, this is crazy.

40:18.569 --> 40:20.337
I know, it is.

40:20.404 --> 40:21.938
Let's talk this through.

40:22.006 --> 40:23.073
Let's.

40:23.874 --> 40:26.009
I know why
you're mad at me.

40:26.077 --> 40:27.210
You do?

40:28.980 --> 40:30.812
Great Falls.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.414
You didn't want me going down
and partying with Caleb,

40:32.482 --> 40:33.582
and when you found out
Kit was coming,

40:33.649 --> 40:35.250
that really got you going.

40:35.318 --> 40:37.052
Wrong.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.788
This has nothing
to do with Kit, okay?

40:39.856 --> 40:42.591
Maybe a little,
but...

40:43.026 --> 40:44.994
It's mostly to do
with the crash.

40:45.061 --> 40:46.894
That's done, Amy.
I'm over it.

40:46.962 --> 40:49.964
Maybe you are;
Maybe I'm not.

40:52.767 --> 40:54.869
Ty, you just survived
a plane crash.

40:54.936 --> 40:56.204
I'm still trying to deal
with that whole thing

40:56.271 --> 41:00.141
and now you're moving on
to motorcycles?

41:00.209 --> 41:01.876
It just scares me.

41:03.277 --> 41:05.479
I'm afraid of losing you.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.913
Hey...

41:06.981 --> 41:08.382
Come here.

41:09.850 --> 41:13.253
You're not gonna
lose me, okay?

41:14.389 --> 41:16.456
Ever. Okay?

41:21.294 --> 41:22.828
Want to go for a ride?

41:22.896 --> 41:24.263
- No.  - Enh?
- No.

41:24.331 --> 41:25.398
Come on.

41:26.266 --> 41:27.799
Does it work?

41:27.867 --> 41:29.735
Runs perfectly.

41:29.802 --> 41:31.070
Says you.

41:31.138 --> 41:32.338
Look what I got you here.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.839
