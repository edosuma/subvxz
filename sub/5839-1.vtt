00:53.220 --> 00:55.806
Now, I know what people mean
when they say,

00:55.848 --> 00:59.226
"I wish I knew then
what I knew now."

01:00.478 --> 01:02.021
Ain't that the truth?

01:04.940 --> 01:06.984
Probably save me a whole lot
of pain and suffering.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.235
That's for sure.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.531
But I guess
in the whole scheme of things,

01:12.573 --> 01:15.367
it's part of God's plan,

01:15.409 --> 01:17.661
and alls we can do
is just roll with it...

01:19.705 --> 01:22.291
'Cause when it comes
right down to it,

01:22.333 --> 01:25.628
God's running the whole show
anyways.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.379
There ain't nothing we can do
to change that.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.802
Believe me.
I've tried.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.055
He'd say go left,

01:36.097 --> 01:37.890
and I'd go right.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.725
He'd say slow down,

01:39.767 --> 01:43.020
and I'd smash on the gas.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.855
Wasn't trying to hear
nothing he had to say.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.902
Maybe that's why
I had to go through all this.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.697
Maybe that's why things
had to happen the way they did.

01:53.739 --> 01:54.907
Go, man.
Go.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.288
Someone once told me

02:01.330 --> 02:04.708
that God sometimes
needs to use extreme measures

02:04.750 --> 02:07.503
to deal with
extreme circumstances.

02:07.545 --> 02:10.339
Guess I was one of those
extreme circumstances.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.009
Sometimes I feel like
God took me

02:14.051 --> 02:15.845
all the way around the block

02:15.886 --> 02:18.639
just to get me next door.

02:18.681 --> 02:20.599
I've seen and experienced
a whole lot

02:20.641 --> 02:22.810
in my short time
on this earth--

02:22.852 --> 02:24.979
loved, laughed,

02:25.020 --> 02:27.982
cried, won, lost.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.859
Through it all,
I can honestly say

02:29.900 --> 02:31.694
I don't have
too many regrets.

02:33.988 --> 02:37.324
It's been
a long, long road, man.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.326
Let me tell you.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.954
Better yet,
let me show you.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.165
Let me take you all the way
back to the beginning,

02:44.206 --> 02:46.292
when life
was a little easier.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.753
Well, sort of.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.594
Look, y'all really need
to tighten up y'all money game

02:56.635 --> 02:58.053
and stop playing around,

02:58.095 --> 02:59.763
start thinking
about your future, feel me?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.765
Yo, Miles,
what's there to think about?

03:01.807 --> 03:03.559
We make money,
then we spend it,

03:03.601 --> 03:04.810
and then we make some more.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.023
Y'all think this is a joke,
man.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.358
Yo, this ain't no game,
man.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.569
Look, I spend half my time
just looking at all the angles,

03:13.611 --> 03:15.404
covering all my tracks,

03:15.446 --> 03:17.948
so I ain't got no problems
with the IRS or nobody else.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.826
What, you think
I don't get noticed?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.579
Young dude
in a $300,000 car,

03:23.621 --> 03:26.165
$1-million home,

03:26.207 --> 03:28.709
and mommy, daddy
ain't nowhere in sight?

03:30.461 --> 03:31.670
Write a check, man.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.298
Man...

03:34.340 --> 03:36.300
Use a credit card
once in a while, you feel me?

03:36.342 --> 03:37.760
All right, now,
let's get this money.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.345
All right, man.
Check this out, Miles.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.722
Say no more, partner.
I feel you, man.

03:41.764 --> 03:42.848
I'm in it to win it.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.183
Here's my cash right here.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.018
Let's do it.
What y'all got?

03:46.060 --> 03:47.436
Get it poppin'.
Yeah.

03:47.478 --> 03:48.687
Holla.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.775
Not light.
Not light.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.487
All right, it's all here.
It's looking good.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.530
So listen, man, we gonna
come back here tonight,

03:58.572 --> 04:00.241
chop it up,
have a few drinks,

04:00.282 --> 04:01.450
celebrate a little bit--

04:01.492 --> 04:03.035
you know, do what we do.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.787
Y'all go ahead
and get out of here, man.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.206
I'll see y'all later.

04:07.248 --> 04:10.042
Wik, you looking a little light,
too, over here, man.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.044
You sure this is 75?

04:12.086 --> 04:13.295
You crazy.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.100
Is that you, Caesar?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.643
No, it's me, Ma.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.436
Miles?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.522
What a surprise, baby.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.940
What are you doing here?

04:32.982 --> 04:34.149
I just came by--

04:34.191 --> 04:35.818
put some paperwork
in the safe.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.153
I'll be right back, okay?
All right, sweetie.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.333
Ah, what you cooking on?

04:51.375 --> 04:52.543
Oh, some spaghetti.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.961
Looks good.
Mm-hmm.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.754
I've always wanted
to go there.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.257
What?
Sandals Resorts?

04:58.299 --> 04:59.591
So why don't you go?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.844
Sure.
Like it's that easy.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.179
We're not all millionaires
like you, mister.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.308
Stop it.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.227
So how you doing, baby?

05:10.269 --> 05:11.270
I'm good.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.855
In fact, I'm extra good.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.189
Extra good, huh?
Yeah.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.858
Well, Mr. Extra Good,

05:15.899 --> 05:18.319
when are you gonna give me
a grandchild, huh, mister?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.696
There you go
talking about these grandkids.

05:20.738 --> 05:22.239
Look, Ma, I told you,

05:22.281 --> 05:24.408
don't be expecting no grandkids
anytime soon.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.784
You need to come to church
with me

05:25.826 --> 05:28.203
and find yourself
a good woman there.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.872
Church, huh?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.415
What, Miles?

05:31.457 --> 05:33.417
You act like
you weren't raised in church.

05:33.459 --> 05:35.753
I took you every Sunday.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.839
Yeah, I was bored every Sunday
too, though, Ma.

05:38.881 --> 05:41.842
I mean, I'm sorry,
but the music was horrible.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.677
The service was gloomy.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.471
All those painted pictures
in the glass

05:45.512 --> 05:48.265
and them spooky little statues
all over the place?

05:48.307 --> 05:49.350
I don't know.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.726
Miles...

05:50.768 --> 05:52.603
I mean, really,
think about it, Ma.

05:52.644 --> 05:56.398
Why do you think I really got up
on Sundays to go to church?

05:56.440 --> 05:59.026
'Cause I knew we'd go
to that brunch afterwards,

05:59.068 --> 06:01.070
and you know I love
that buffet.

06:02.780 --> 06:06.075
You go light a candle
for that one, Miles Montego,

06:06.116 --> 06:07.951
because if I have to start
making you go,

06:07.993 --> 06:09.203
you know I will, okay?

06:09.244 --> 06:10.579
Mm-hmm.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.122
You know that I will.
Uh-huh, I know.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.957
Because you have a lot
to be grateful for.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.044
I guess.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.128
I tell you what, though.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.129
What?

06:19.171 --> 06:20.547
If you find one of those

06:20.589 --> 06:22.341
nice young ladies
down at your church...

06:22.383 --> 06:23.384
Mm-hmm.

06:23.425 --> 06:24.802
You give them my number

06:24.843 --> 06:26.136
and tell them I'm down
for whatev.

06:26.178 --> 06:29.348
Whatever, huh?
Whatev.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.433
Love you, Ma.
Love you too, honey.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.102
All right,
I'm gonna go on and go,

06:33.143 --> 06:34.645
but tell Dad I said hello,

06:34.686 --> 06:36.647
and I'll holler at him later,
okay?

06:36.688 --> 06:38.065
Holler?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.486
What is "holler," Miles?

06:42.528 --> 06:45.239
See you later, Ma.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.208
Have a seat, gentlemen.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.924
You know what these are?

07:03.966 --> 07:05.384
These are time
and expense sheets

07:05.426 --> 07:08.554
for the Montego case,

07:08.595 --> 07:10.431
and you guys spent
way more time and money

07:10.472 --> 07:11.682
than I ever authorized.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.016
Sir, we believe
very strongly

07:13.058 --> 07:14.476
that this crew
is one of the biggest

07:14.518 --> 07:16.395
operating in this region,

07:16.437 --> 07:18.105
with ties
with several other states.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.565
This guy lives in a house
that's worth

07:19.606 --> 07:21.191
more than all of our houses
put together.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.693
One of his dozen cars

07:22.734 --> 07:24.570
is worth more than
all of our cars combined.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.822
He wears what we make
in a year on his wrist.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.907
So we're working on this one
around the clock, chief.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.409
Well, you ought to stop
right there,

07:30.451 --> 07:32.202
'cause that's your problem.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.955
You're working around the clock.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.958
Now, "around the clock" costs
this office a lot of money.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.460
So what now?

07:39.501 --> 07:42.087
We're gonna put a price tag
on justice?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.882
This conversation is over.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.050
I want a full progress
and status report

07:47.092 --> 07:50.012
on my desk by the morning,

07:50.053 --> 07:52.306
and I'll decide
whether or not to shut it down.

Got to be kidding me, man.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.818
You in a hurry today, son?

09:27.859 --> 09:29.444
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.696
Yeah.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.906
Yeah, you're probably right.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.366
Drivers license,
registration,

09:34.408 --> 09:37.077
and proof of insurance.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.008
All right, gentlemen,
listen up.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.634
Shh.
And ladies.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.387
Let me tell you
what we got today.

09:55.429 --> 09:59.391
First up,
we got Percy Taylor,

09:59.433 --> 10:00.684
aka P-body.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.227
He's the muscle of this crew

10:02.269 --> 10:04.479
that we've been keeping
an eye on for some time.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.232
Next up we have
Martin De LaFuente.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.651
He is best friends
with the leader of this crew.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.070
You can be sure
wherever you see the leader,

10:12.112 --> 10:15.741
you will see Mr. De LaFuente
not too far behind.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.619
Next we have
Taylor Delmonico,

10:18.660 --> 10:20.787
better known as "Wikki."

10:22.039 --> 10:24.082
I know. I know.
I agree with you.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.917
He's got a stupid name,
but don't be fooled.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.879
He's just as dangerous
as the rest of this crew.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.006
Next up, Chris Mayor.

10:31.048 --> 10:34.718
Now, this guy is the number one
moneymaker for these guys.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.304
Don't let his baby face
fool you either.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.555
Last but not least,

10:38.597 --> 10:39.973
we got the leader of this crew,

10:40.015 --> 10:41.391
Miles Montego.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.518
We have reason to believe

10:43.560 --> 10:45.520
this guy is the biggest
drug trafficker

10:45.562 --> 10:47.898
in all of northern California,

10:47.939 --> 10:50.442
which is exactly why we want
to nail this guy.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.820
He's smart, he's rich,
and he's good-looking,

10:53.862 --> 10:55.280
but I don't
necessarily think

10:55.322 --> 10:57.532
I'd want him marrying off
to my daughter.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.743
All right, listen up.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.495
All kidding aside,
this entire crew

11:01.536 --> 11:04.665
is considered to be armed
and very, very dangerous.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.209
The way they work
is very tight and efficient,

11:07.250 --> 11:09.086
and they do not like anyone

11:09.127 --> 11:11.338
coming between them
and their money.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.550
To the money, baby!

11:15.592 --> 11:16.802
To the money!

11:20.263 --> 11:22.432
Yo, let me get
another round of those.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.601
Yo, Miles, let me holla at you
right quick, dog.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.436
What's happening?

11:28.855 --> 11:30.691
Yo, man,
check this out, dog.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.859
I know you don't like to hear
this kind of stuff no more--

11:32.901 --> 11:34.027
and I get that dog,
I do--

11:34.069 --> 11:36.113
but your boy Jesse,

11:36.154 --> 11:38.031
he owe me a whole lot of loot,
dog.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.449
He been giving me
the runaround

11:39.491 --> 11:41.243
for, like, the past
two, three weeks, homey.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.245
All right, Marty.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.080
This is the last time.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.331
Like I told you before, man,

11:46.373 --> 11:48.083
I don't want
to hear nothing

11:48.125 --> 11:49.710
about no what, when, why--

11:49.751 --> 11:52.587
none of that, you feel me?

11:52.629 --> 11:55.006
I feel you, boss.
I'm serious about this, man.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.476
Nick.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.853
How you doing?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.312
I'm doing good.
I'm hanging in.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.856
Not as good as you.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.733
You got to learn to leave
some of that cash around

12:12.774 --> 12:14.317
so we can make some.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.902
Aah, stop it, man.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.321
Anyway, look,
it's the Fourth of July weekend,

12:18.363 --> 12:20.741
and I got a real great
group of people coming over.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.284
I got steaks from Argentina.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.327
I got lobsters from Maine.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.455
All I need is for you to come by
and hang out

12:26.496 --> 12:28.582
so I don't feel like
I only know old people.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.125
Sounds good, Nick.
You know what?

12:30.167 --> 12:31.543
I think I'm gonna
take you up on that.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.170
Yeah?
So you gonna come by?

12:33.211 --> 12:35.130
I'll probably shoot over there
in about an hour.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.506
Okay, good.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.799
I'll see you in a bit, then,
okay?

12:37.841 --> 12:39.509
All right, cool.
Okay, good.

12:39.551 --> 12:43.054
♪ 'Cause I'm ready to give
right now ♪

12:43.096 --> 12:44.890
♪ And I'm ready for love
right now ♪

12:44.931 --> 12:46.725
Yo, Miles!

12:46.767 --> 12:48.727
My youngest and coolest
friend in the world.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.062
You made it, man.
Yep.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.231
Hey, everybody, I told you
I got cool friends!

12:53.273 --> 12:54.816
This is Miles.
Man, get out of here.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.485
I'm trying to get like you
when I get older.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.778
Old?
Who you calling old?

12:57.819 --> 12:59.237
Yeah,
you putting on a little, man.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.323
I'm putting it on.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.949
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So who you with?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.785
I'm solo today.
Solo?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.496
Well, just don't let money
run your life, Miles.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.622
Otherwise,
you're gonna end up

13:08.663 --> 13:10.040
like these guys out here.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.333
They look like they doing
all right to me.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.959
I'm serious, Miles.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.170
I'm asking one of these guys
to pass the chips,

13:15.212 --> 13:16.505
and he wants to ask me

13:16.546 --> 13:18.340
what the market closed at
yesterday.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.175
Come on, man.
Get a life.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.010
I used to be the same way,
Miles.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.846
But my career
almost cost me my family,

13:24.888 --> 13:26.890
and it got to the point
where me and Karen--

13:26.932 --> 13:28.433
we didn't know each other
anymore.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.144
She said the only thing
that kept us together

13:31.186 --> 13:33.146
was answered prayers
from her church group,

13:33.188 --> 13:35.565
so I had to commit
to going to church every Sunday

13:35.607 --> 13:37.984
as a family
and one date night a week.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.862
I never figured you
to be a religious guy, Nick.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.572
Well, we really don't like

13:42.614 --> 13:44.282
that word "religious,"
Miles.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.785
It's kind of like
the word "margin call"

13:46.827 --> 13:48.411
in the stock market.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.121
I'd prefer "man of faith."

13:50.163 --> 13:51.790
All right, guys,
food is ready.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.041
Oh, let's eat.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.922
So can we all gather around

13:58.964 --> 14:00.757
and have a word of prayer
before we eat?

14:00.799 --> 14:02.634
First,
I'd like to thank you all

14:02.676 --> 14:04.469
for coming to our home today.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.471
We are so thankful
and blessed

14:06.513 --> 14:09.057
to have such wonderful people
in our lives

14:09.099 --> 14:12.686
and so happy that you were able
to come over and join--

14:12.727 --> 14:15.480
Honey, could you, um,
get to the prayer?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.691
I mean, this is not the Oscars.
Everybody's starving.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.403
Well, I was just about
to thank my wonderful husband

14:21.444 --> 14:23.613
for putting this all together,
but...

14:23.655 --> 14:26.533
I guess I'll just get
straight to the point.

14:26.575 --> 14:30.370
Dear Father, thank You
for this glorious day.

14:30.412 --> 14:33.248
It's easy to believe in You,
to have faith in You,

14:33.290 --> 14:35.959
when we're blessed
with such beautiful weather,

14:36.001 --> 14:37.586
such delicious food,

14:37.627 --> 14:38.962
but most importantly,

14:39.004 --> 14:40.505
for the friends and family
that we have

14:40.547 --> 14:43.842
joining us
to enjoy this today.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.844
For this and more,
we give You thanks.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.095
Amen.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.513
Amen.
Amen.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.265
Amen.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.938
Oh, that's Vanessa.

14:56.980 --> 15:01.109
She goes to Bible study
every week with my wife.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.444
Hmm.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.862
Bible study, huh?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.281
Mm, Bible study.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.116
She come over a lot?

15:08.158 --> 15:10.035
Come on.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.079
Miles!

15:13.121 --> 15:14.497
Hey, ladies,
how y'all doing?

15:14.539 --> 15:15.999
I'd like to introduce you

15:16.041 --> 15:17.834
to some of my girlfriends
from Bible study.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.461
This is Shari...
Hey, Miles.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.254
Maylin...
Nice to meet you.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.048
And Sarah.
Pleasure to meet you, Miles.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.674
You as well.
And then there's Vanessa.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.301
Hi, how are you?
How are you?

15:26.343 --> 15:29.304
I'm good.
Miles is a very cool name.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.014
Thank you.

15:31.056 --> 15:34.768
Uh, can I get my hand back
before I call 911?

15:34.809 --> 15:35.894
Rm 50"'!!-

15:35.936 --> 15:37.771
It's cool.

15:37.812 --> 15:41.524
Hey, Dad, watch this!

15:41.566 --> 15:43.360
So how do you know
the Halston family?

15:43.401 --> 15:45.153
You know, Nick's my broker
and my money guy,

15:45.195 --> 15:47.781
so we hang out
from time to time.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.367
So young and into stocks.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.452
So how do you know
Nick and Karen?

15:52.494 --> 15:54.704
We actually all go to
the same church and Bible study.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.081
Okay.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.499
So you go to church
on Sundays, then?

15:57.540 --> 15:59.459
Yes, sir.
Every Sunday.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.753
So, uh, what was
your religion again?

16:01.795 --> 16:03.213
I guess I'm "Christian,"
but, you know,

16:03.254 --> 16:04.631
we don't really
like to call it that.

16:04.673 --> 16:07.258
Right, right.
You like to say "men of faith."

16:07.300 --> 16:08.677
Or in your case,
it would be "woman of faith."

16:08.718 --> 16:09.886
Exactly,
so you know exactly

16:09.928 --> 16:11.221
what I'm talking about,
right?

16:11.262 --> 16:12.847
Well, yeah,
doesn't everybody?

16:12.847 --> 16:15.100
What church do you attend?

16:15.141 --> 16:18.561
Oh, well, right now,
I'm kind of in between churches.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.314
Between churches, huh?

16:21.356 --> 16:22.482
Yeah.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.401
In between churches.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.777
All right, well,
what was the name

16:25.819 --> 16:27.195
of the last church
you attended?

16:27.237 --> 16:29.197
I really don't remember,

16:29.239 --> 16:32.200
but I'm sure I could call my mom
and she, you know--

16:32.242 --> 16:34.661
You are so playing with me
right now, Mr. Miles.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.329
All right, you caught me.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.748
But I do go to church
on Easter Sundays with my mom,

16:38.790 --> 16:41.376
and on Christmas, I mean,
if that counts for anything.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.004
Look, I grew up
in a Catholic church,

16:44.045 --> 16:45.422
but, you know, I don't know--

16:45.463 --> 16:47.632
I never really stuck with it.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.927
I think I just didn't
feel comfortable in my church.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.471
Well, you should find a church
you do feel comfortable at

16:53.513 --> 16:55.056
and stick with it.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.575
Wow, I guess we shut
this joint down, didn't we?

17:13.616 --> 17:14.992
We sure did.

17:15.035 --> 17:18.329
So you think
somewhere between school

17:18.371 --> 17:20.330
and saving the world,

17:20.373 --> 17:22.416
you could make a little time
so I could see you again?

17:22.459 --> 17:26.003
Please, Miles,
my life is not that serious.

17:26.046 --> 17:29.007
But yes, I'd love to.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.592
Great.
Hold on.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.093
Give me your phone.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.344
Okay, here we go.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.015
I got a good idea.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.600
How about we not play

17:38.641 --> 17:40.518
the "who can wait the longest
to call who" game?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.978
Yeah, I don't like
that game either.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.646
Okay, I got a better one.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.857
How about we play the
"who can call who first" game?

17:45.899 --> 17:47.067
Ah, see, I'm into that.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.485
I'm into that, too.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.490
Yo, it's definitely time
for me to go.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.158
Yeah.

17:55.200 --> 17:59.329
So, uh, I guess I'll
be talking to you tomorrow?

17:59.370 --> 18:00.747
Soon?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.835
Not if I talk to you first.

18:10.173 --> 18:14.552
Yo, we in San Jose,
not San Francisco.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.553
Yo, you good?

18:34.239 --> 18:36.616
Good morning, Vanessa.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.954
Mmmmm.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.664
See what she talking about...

18:47.627 --> 18:49.295
Good morning, Mr. Miles.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.131
Look, I know
it's a little early,

18:51.172 --> 18:54.676
but, you know, my Sundays start
when the sun comes up.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.511
Just wanted to say
that I really enjoyed

18:56.553 --> 18:58.513
meeting you yesterday,

18:58.555 --> 19:00.890
and hopefully I look forward
to hanging out with you again.

19:00.932 --> 19:04.602
Well, have a blessed day,
Mr. Miles Montego.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.729
By the way, I win the game.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.357
Peace.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.708
Hello?

19:26.749 --> 19:29.711
Well, aren't we
quite the busy bee at 6:00 a.m.?

19:31.212 --> 19:33.173
You're awake?
Ain't no question.

19:33.214 --> 19:36.342
My days usually start
at 5:00 a.m. anyway, so...

19:36.384 --> 19:37.552
5:00 a.m.?
What are you?

19:37.594 --> 19:40.054
Like, a baker?
Nah.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.681
You know, I deal a lot
with the east coast,

19:41.723 --> 19:43.308
so the time difference
gets me up.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.726
Okay, big shot.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.352
So how about it?

19:46.394 --> 19:48.104
Want to come to church
with me today?

19:48.146 --> 19:49.772
You know what?

19:49.814 --> 19:52.400
I got a gang of stuff
I got to get done by tomorrow,

19:52.442 --> 19:54.611
but I'll definitely take
a rain check on it

19:54.652 --> 19:56.070
if that's all right
with you.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.906
Of course.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.325
Yeah, anytime.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.952
Well, I actually got to run
right now,

20:02.994 --> 20:04.454
but maybe we could talk later?

20:04.495 --> 20:06.456
How about we leave
the maybes out of this

20:06.497 --> 20:08.041
and just get together

20:08.082 --> 20:09.667
after we done doing
what we both got to do?

20:32.440 --> 20:35.860
Not only does he get to flaunt
all that money around town,

20:35.902 --> 20:37.946
but he gets
the pretty girls, too.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.951
Is that a little jealousy
I'm sensing, McDaniel?

20:42.992 --> 20:45.828
Oh, no, it's not jealousy.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.080
When I slap the cuffs
on this guy

20:47.121 --> 20:48.623
and he gets 25 to life

20:48.665 --> 20:52.460
while I'm home
all warm and cozy in my bed,

20:52.502 --> 20:54.128
that's when you'll see
some jealousy.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.648
You live here by yourself?

21:13.690 --> 21:15.650
Well, yeah,
unless there's some roaches

21:15.692 --> 21:17.568
I don't know about.

21:21.864 --> 21:25.535
Miles, this place
is beautiful.

21:25.576 --> 21:26.953
Thanks, babe.
I'm glad you like it.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.454
Like it?

21:28.496 --> 21:30.456
I love it.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.084
So how many bedrooms
does it have?

21:33.126 --> 21:36.087
Uh, last time I checked,
eight.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.172
Eight bedrooms
for one person?

21:38.214 --> 21:40.883
Now, why would you buy a house
with eight bedrooms?

21:40.925 --> 21:42.927
I needed
some extra closet space.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.095
I'm playing.
I'm playing.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.388
You so wrong.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.015
I'm joking.
I'm joking.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.683
Oh, even the kitchen
is sick.

21:48.725 --> 21:49.892
You cook?

21:49.934 --> 21:51.352
I do a little something.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.313
You know, maybe
you come over one night and...

21:53.354 --> 21:54.731
put something together
for you.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.149
Okay.

21:56.190 --> 22:00.361
So this big house,
for one person?

22:00.403 --> 22:02.572
I don't use all this space.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.158
I usually end up sleeping
on the couches half the time.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.286
Yo, I always pass this place,

22:08.328 --> 22:10.079
but I've never actually
eaten here.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.164
Yeah?

22:11.205 --> 22:12.540
I hope you're hungry,

22:12.582 --> 22:14.751
'cause the food here
is amazing.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.504
Oh, my goodness.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.797
No, I know.
You got to get it.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.882
I got to take this one.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.133
I'm sorry.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.636
Yo.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.430
Hey, what's buzzin', cousin?

22:27.472 --> 22:29.724
T, what's going on, man?
What's happening?

22:29.766 --> 22:31.601
I'm just trying to make
a dollar out of 15 cents.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.019
You know.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.562
So, hey, did you fire off
that package?

22:34.604 --> 22:36.230
Oh, yeah, man,
that should be on your desk

22:36.272 --> 22:38.232
by tomorrow morning,
probably around 10:00.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.068
Man, I like your style,
Miles.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.236
So you all locked and loaded
on your end, right?

22:42.278 --> 22:43.905
Oh, yeah, for sure, man.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.948
Everything's set up
just the way we planned it, man.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.575
I got y'all hooked up, man,

22:47.617 --> 22:49.035
so I'll see y'all
in a couple of weeks.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.620
One love, baby.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.456
What do you make of this,
Brian?

22:53.498 --> 22:56.250
You ever hear
of this guy T before?

22:56.292 --> 22:58.753
Can't say that I have.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.339
Where'd the call come from?

23:01.381 --> 23:03.883
Cell phone outside of Ohio.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.093
Could be one of his clients,

23:05.134 --> 23:07.887
maybe even a connection.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.555
That would be my guess.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.435
This is good, right?

23:14.477 --> 23:15.520
Yeah.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.771
Real good.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.775
Do you have to go?

23:20.817 --> 23:22.235
'Cause I would totally
understand.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.903
Oh, no, no, no.
Know what?

23:23.945 --> 23:26.447
Matter of fact, let me
turn this phone off right now

23:26.489 --> 23:28.282
so we can enjoy our dinner.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.326
Don't you dare, Miles.
No, no, it's okay, really.

23:30.368 --> 23:31.744
Yo, it's clearly business.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.580
Like, I would never ask you
to do that.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.917
You know what?
That's dope.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.669
I mean, you know,
a lot of women,

23:39.710 --> 23:42.422
they'd be like, you know,
"You're being rude,"

23:42.463 --> 23:46.050
or, you know,
"Could you turn that off?"

23:46.092 --> 23:49.387
Anyways,
so did the stock market

23:49.429 --> 23:50.763
get you all of this--

23:50.805 --> 23:52.390
the house, the cars,
the jewelry--

23:52.432 --> 23:55.977
or did you, like, run into some
amazing family fortune?

23:56.018 --> 23:57.437
Actually,
I like to keep my hands

23:57.478 --> 23:58.938
in a lot of different things.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.940
You know, right now,
I got a string of shows

24:00.982 --> 24:02.483
that I'm doing right here
in the Bay.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.068
Matter of fact,
I'm doing three shows.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.904
I got one in Frisco,
one in Oakland,

24:06.946 --> 24:08.739
and I'm doing one right here
in San Jose.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.367
Wow, Miles, that's--
that's exciting.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.372
You know, I was thinking,
um...

24:16.414 --> 24:18.166
I don't know--
maybe you might want

24:18.207 --> 24:20.793
to come hang out with me
for a couple of the shows.

24:20.835 --> 24:23.004
You ain't got to go
to all of them, but you know...

24:23.045 --> 24:27.842
Mr. Miles, are you
asking me on another date?

24:27.884 --> 24:32.054
Why, I think I am,
Miss Vanessa.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.931
I'd love that.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.224
Well, then it's a date.

24:41.522 --> 24:44.901
Look, Miles, I really
had a good time tonight.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.277
You know,
I really did, too.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.653
I'm not just saying that!

24:47.695 --> 24:50.448
Me neither.
I had a great time.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.283
Yo, I still cannot believe

24:52.325 --> 24:55.286
you spent all this money
on this big house

24:55.328 --> 24:56.704
to live in it by yourself.

24:56.746 --> 24:58.164
Really?
I don't know.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.249
Well, maybe one day,
I'll find somebody

25:00.291 --> 25:03.252
to, you know, fill it.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.879
I mean, does it really
make a difference

25:04.921 --> 25:06.672
if I get the house first

25:06.714 --> 25:08.674
and then find somebody special
to share it with?

25:08.716 --> 25:10.510
I guess not.
No.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.847
Silver convertible, huh?

25:14.889 --> 25:16.599
Yep.
And?

25:18.226 --> 25:19.602
You want to hear
a funny story?

25:19.644 --> 25:20.811
Sure.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.232
A few weeks ago,
I'm driving,

25:24.273 --> 25:27.235
and I come to this stop sign,

25:27.276 --> 25:29.237
and I look over
at the intersection,

25:29.278 --> 25:32.448
and I see this convertible,

25:32.490 --> 25:35.201
but what really caught my eye
was this--

25:35.243 --> 25:38.329
this beautiful woman
that was driving.

25:38.371 --> 25:42.750
I mean, she had, like,
long, beautiful black hair

25:42.792 --> 25:45.127
kind of like yours.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.504
And she was wearing
these shades--

25:46.546 --> 25:48.089
these really hot shades.

25:48.130 --> 25:51.509
I mean, I was on her.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.136
I felt like
I had to catch her.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.848
So I--
you know, I get in pursuit.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.642
I'm holding up traffic.

25:59.684 --> 26:03.062
I'm bobbing and weaving
in between cars.

26:03.104 --> 26:06.065
Anyway, to make
a long story short,

26:06.107 --> 26:08.818
I get pulled over
by the police,

26:08.859 --> 26:11.612
but you know what really,
really bothered me?

26:13.864 --> 26:15.074
What?

26:16.909 --> 26:19.495
Was that I didn't get a chance
to meet her.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.540
I didn't get a chance
to know who she was.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.421
What kind of car
did you say this was?

26:31.048 --> 26:32.425
Um, hmm.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.722
A silver convertible Sebring.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.411
Oh, my gosh.

27:00.453 --> 27:01.829
What?
Oh, my gosh.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.331
Yo, he's in the store.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.749
The guy you just met?
Yes, he's in the--

27:04.790 --> 27:05.916
Miles?
Where?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.501
Don't say his name so loud.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.128
He's gonna hear you.
Girl, he is so fine.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.129
Ooh, he sure is.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.714
I so hate you right now.

27:11.756 --> 27:12.965
Well, don't just stand there.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.300
Go over there and talk to him.

27:14.342 --> 27:15.760
We all know
he didn't come here

27:15.801 --> 27:17.928
to buy a Jesus bumper sticker
for his Bentley.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.180
Go.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.852
Hey, you.
Hey.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.395
What are you doing here?

27:26.437 --> 27:27.855
You know,
I was in the neighborhood.

27:27.897 --> 27:29.398
Thought I'd stop by
and surprise you.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.025
Well, I am surprised.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.443
I love the spot.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.195
What kind of store is this?
Thank you.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.197
We are a faith-based
product store.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.990
Okay.

27:38.032 --> 27:41.410
So I guess
there's a pretty big market

27:41.452 --> 27:43.120
for this church stuff, huh?

27:43.162 --> 27:44.538
That's right.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.374
Aw, they look really cute
together.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.626
She looks really happy.
Yeah, I know.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.628
Her last boyfriend
was such a jerk.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.838
We have, like,
a bunch of T-shirts

27:52.880 --> 27:56.467
and, you know, books, and CDs
that are Christ-like themed.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.260
Stuff like that.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.804
And these are all
Christian artists?

27:59.845 --> 28:01.597
That's right.

28:01.639 --> 28:04.475
This dude right here
looks like a real rapper.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.102
Come on, Miles.
He is a real rapper.

28:06.143 --> 28:07.728
He just, you know,
raps about the Lord.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.480
Nah, nah, nah.
That's not what I'm saying.

28:09.522 --> 28:12.108
I mean, look, this dude
looks like a gangster,

28:12.149 --> 28:14.110
and the music that was playing
when I came in

28:14.151 --> 28:15.736
made me feel like
I wanted to stage dive.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.989
Yo, you never listened
to Christian music?

28:19.031 --> 28:20.449
Nah.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.076
I mean, well, you know,
my moms used to play,

28:22.118 --> 28:23.911
like, Elvis Presley gospel
albums on Sundays,

28:23.953 --> 28:26.080
but other than that, nah.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.498
Well, yo,
I am about to hook you up

28:27.540 --> 28:29.333
with some really, really hot
Christian music,

28:29.375 --> 28:30.710
hold on a sec.
I'ma get you some CDs.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.420
Okay.

28:32.461 --> 28:33.629
T-bone...

28:33.671 --> 28:35.256
Bone-a-fide.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.260
What you got for me?

28:39.301 --> 28:41.387
All right, so I hooked you up
with some really hot CDs.

28:41.429 --> 28:43.097
Trust me, you have to listen
to this, Miles.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.223
You're really gonna like it.

28:44.265 --> 28:45.224
If you say so.

28:45.266 --> 28:46.767
How much I owe you?

28:46.809 --> 28:48.477
Consider it a gift
from me to you.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.813
Okay.
I love gifts.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.815
Oh, look, look,
I got a birthday party

28:52.857 --> 28:54.608
that I'm going to tonight.

28:54.650 --> 28:55.735
You want to go?

28:55.776 --> 28:58.154
A party?
Yeah.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.864
I might be able to,
you know, swing it.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.365
All right.
How does 7:00 sound?

29:01.407 --> 29:03.033
All right, cool,
you pick me up at my spot,

29:03.075 --> 29:04.243
and then you can meet my family.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.661
Meet the family?

29:05.703 --> 29:07.455
This is getting serious now,
huh?

29:07.496 --> 29:09.039
Oh, please.
They don't bite.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.166
Sure about that?

29:10.207 --> 29:11.542
Yes.

29:11.584 --> 29:12.835
All right,
I'll see you at 7:00.

29:15.004 --> 29:16.589
Oh, my gosh.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.674
Mad cute, right?

29:18.716 --> 29:20.176
He's gonna meet my parents
tonight.

29:25.181 --> 29:28.559
Seriously, is someone
gonna get that?

29:30.227 --> 29:31.437
Hold on.

29:33.481 --> 29:35.357
Have mercy!

29:35.399 --> 29:37.401
I got to call you back.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.778
Hi.
Hey, how you doing?

29:38.819 --> 29:39.862
I'm Alyssa.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.197
I'm Miles.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.741
I'm here to pick up
Vanessa.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.117
Figures.

29:45.159 --> 29:48.204
Vanessa,
somebody's here for you!

29:48.245 --> 29:50.831
Mom, have you seen
my phone charger?

29:50.873 --> 29:52.833
Hey, you must be Miles.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.419
Hi, I'm Julissa,
Vanessa's younger sister.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.754
Do all you guys yell
around here?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.088
You're killing me right now.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.799
Yeah, pretty much.
Loud as can be.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.383
Well, it was nice
meeting you.

30:01.425 --> 30:02.635
You too.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.850
Hello, I'm Miguel Leon,
and you are?

30:09.892 --> 30:11.018
How you doing, Mr. Leon?

30:11.060 --> 30:12.603
I'm Miles Montego.

30:12.645 --> 30:15.564
Wow, Miles Montego sounds like
a secret agent name.

30:15.606 --> 30:16.941
Man of mystery.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.442
Well, sorry to disappoint,

30:18.484 --> 30:20.069
but no mystery here.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.655
What you see is what you get.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.281
Honey, this is Miles.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.742
He's here to pick up Vanessa.

30:26.784 --> 30:28.953
On.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.956
You're Miles?

30:31.997 --> 30:34.708
Uh, yeah,
last time I checked.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.545
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Leon.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.089
And what church do you go to,
Miles?

30:40.130 --> 30:41.423
Wow.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.843
Well, um,
I'm kind of looking

30:43.884 --> 30:45.052
for a new church
right now.

30:45.094 --> 30:46.679
On.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.514
And what is it that you do?

30:48.556 --> 30:50.349
Honey,
enough drilling already.

30:50.391 --> 30:51.809
Well, I just want to know

30:51.851 --> 30:53.394
who our daughter's
hanging out with.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.020
All right, well,
I see you've met everyone.

30:55.062 --> 30:56.355
We're gonna head on out,
you guys.

30:56.397 --> 30:57.648
Good night.
Love you, Dad, bye.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.650
Good-bye.
It was nice meeting you.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.988
♪ I want you
to possess my body ♪

31:04.029 --> 31:06.407
What's happening?
Could it really be?

31:06.448 --> 31:08.534
Is it Miles Montego?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.369
What up, baby?
What's happening?

31:10.411 --> 31:12.788
Montego, wait a minute--
I thought you left the country.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.206
You lucky you showed up,
homey.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.250
I was gonna go straight
to your house from here.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.460
You know I wouldn't have
missed that for nothing, man.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.212
Appreciate that.

31:20.254 --> 31:22.631
Fellas, I want y'all to meet
my new lady right here.

31:22.673 --> 31:23.883
This is Vanessa.

31:23.924 --> 31:25.801
Vanessa, that's Chris.
Hi.

31:25.843 --> 31:28.637
That's Wikki, Percy,
and this one right here,

31:28.679 --> 31:30.639
that's my right-hand man,
Marty.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.141
Hey, Marty.

31:32.182 --> 31:33.767
It's such a pleasure
to meet you guys.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.728
You know, Miles talks about
you guys all the time.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.354
Yo, let's go inside
and get some drinks.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.981
Man, let's do it right.
Come on.

31:39.023 --> 31:41.191
Thank you, baby.
Yeah.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.402
Don't let me see you
around here again!

31:43.444 --> 31:44.987
You all right, baby?
Yeah.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.447
Miles!

31:46.488 --> 31:48.240
Bootz, man, you always
up to something, man.

31:48.282 --> 31:49.700
What's going on?
Nothing much, man.

31:49.742 --> 31:50.743
All right.
All right.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.036
What's up, big homey?

31:52.077 --> 31:54.204
Good to see you, man.

I know who he is.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.442
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Rice.

32:23.484 --> 32:24.818

but also, Miles,
I don't want you to forget

32:29.531 --> 32:30.908
about those tickets
for that show.

32:30.950 --> 32:34.828
Oh, Jerry, come on,
I got you, baby.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.789
And, Vanessa,
it's really nice to meet you.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.040
Pleasure meeting you.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.044
Yo, babe,
you know Jerry Rice?

32:42.086 --> 32:44.213
Oh, yeah,
Jerry's a good dude--

32:44.254 --> 32:45.839
Babe,
my dad is gonna trip out

32:45.881 --> 32:47.758
when he finds out
I met Jerry Rice!

32:48.968 --> 32:51.512
Hey!
How are you?

32:51.553 --> 32:54.807
Ladies, I want y'all to meet
my baby, Vanessa.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.892
Vanessa, this is Nicole,

32:58.143 --> 32:59.353
that's Simone,

32:59.395 --> 33:00.396

33:00.437 --> 33:02.356
Nice to meet you guys.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.984
Hey, yo, what's good, Chico?
Let's have some shots, man.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.486
Ah, not tonight, Marty, man.
I'm driving.

33:07.528 --> 33:09.238
Not tonight?
Man, it's my birthday, homey.

33:09.279 --> 33:10.948
I mean, that's why we all here
celebrating.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.158
I mean, just one shot, man.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.451
All right, maybe later.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.828
Psh, man,
I remember that one time

33:15.869 --> 33:17.204
he was hanging out the window

33:17.246 --> 33:18.747
with guns blazing
like a madman like--

33:21.333 --> 33:22.668
Hey, Vanessa,
you don't even know.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.169
Miles Montego?

33:24.211 --> 33:25.713
You're sitting
with a real legend, Ma.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.172
I seen my man--

33:27.214 --> 33:29.299
Let's go get that shot

33:39.435 --> 33:42.604
is everything they say
about Miles true?

33:42.646 --> 33:43.814
About what?

33:43.856 --> 33:46.275
You know.

33:46.316 --> 33:47.901
Oh, wow.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.739
Um, I'm not trying
to keep you girls in suspense,

33:51.780 --> 33:53.365
but I wouldn't know.

33:53.407 --> 33:56.744
You mean you two
haven't slept together yet?

33:56.785 --> 33:58.787
Look, we're just trying
to, you know, take it slow.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.581
That's all.
Nice and slow?

34:00.622 --> 34:02.624
Are we talking about
the same Miles here?

34:05.085 --> 34:06.336
So what,
y'all trying to make me

34:06.378 --> 34:09.965
look like a psycho or something?

34:10.007 --> 34:13.177
She ain't trying
to hear all that, man.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.388
Does she look
like she's impressed?

34:16.429 --> 34:20.059
Do me a favor.
Tone it down.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.435
Tone it down, man.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.690
Just saying, man.
Just saying.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.359
You went out there,
talking all that stuff, man...

34:29.400 --> 34:31.152
I'ma finish his drink.

34:32.529 --> 34:33.697
Wow, that was...

34:34.782 --> 34:37.034
quite an evening.

34:37.076 --> 34:38.869
Babe, I am so sorry.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.536
I thought they'd act way cooler
than that.

34:40.579 --> 34:41.955
You don't have to say
you're sorry.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.373
Everybody has a past.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.625
We all do.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.376
Yeah.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.545
You know you can talk to me
about anything, right, baby?

34:49.588 --> 34:50.797
Yeah.

34:50.839 --> 34:55.010
Look, I got a past, baby.

34:55.052 --> 34:58.055
One I'm not
particularly proud of.

35:00.557 --> 35:03.102
And if you were
to hear about it...

35:03.143 --> 35:05.354
I don't know, I--

35:05.395 --> 35:09.191
I feel like you might not want
to see me no more,

35:09.233 --> 35:11.068
and that kind of scares me,
babe.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.694
Miles, what's the matter?

35:20.994 --> 35:24.790
Look, I know this great
little restaurant.

35:24.832 --> 35:26.125
Great coffee.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.752
Best pie in town.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.003
I mean, if that's all right.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.341
Sure.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.011
Let's go.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.518
What's wrong, Lydia?

35:44.560 --> 35:46.353
Please go to sleep.

35:46.395 --> 35:47.813
Sleep?

35:47.855 --> 35:49.439
How can you sleep
when our daughter's out

35:49.481 --> 35:50.983
with that--
that--

35:51.024 --> 35:52.401
That boy.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.945
He's a boy, Lydia.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.446
Well,
I got a really bad vibe

35:56.488 --> 35:59.491
from that so-called boy,
Miguel.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.326
He doesn't seem her type.

36:01.368 --> 36:04.538
According to you,
she'll never have a type.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.124
Please go to sleep.

36:17.301 --> 36:19.178
Now, promise me
you're gonna have an open mind

36:19.219 --> 36:20.846
and not freak out on me.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.098
I promise.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.017
What'd you think
about my friends tonight?

36:27.895 --> 36:30.522
They looked like gangsters
and drug dealers.

36:30.564 --> 36:33.734
That's because they are, V.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.945
I mean, they're not, like,
Mafia or anything,

36:36.987 --> 36:39.156
but they live that lifestyle,

36:39.198 --> 36:41.575
and to be honest,
I used to live just like them.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.535
In fact,

36:43.577 --> 36:45.454
they all used to work for me.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.792
Work for you?

36:50.834 --> 36:53.212
Doing what?

36:53.253 --> 36:54.379
Here we go.

36:54.421 --> 36:55.631
Thank you.

36:58.634 --> 37:00.802
Folks, let me know if
there's anything else you need.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.012
Yep.
Thank you.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.264
Work for you doing what?

37:04.306 --> 37:06.892
I used to be a drug dealer,
Vanessa,

37:06.934 --> 37:09.353
and those guys you met
tonight,

37:09.394 --> 37:11.980
that was my crew.

37:12.022 --> 37:14.775
I mean, basically,
we was into any and everything.

37:19.655 --> 37:21.615
Wow, Miles, I don't--

37:21.657 --> 37:23.450
I don't even know
what to say.

37:27.329 --> 37:29.706
Look.

37:29.748 --> 37:33.460
I don't talk about it
'cause I'm not proud of it.

37:33.502 --> 37:34.962
I mean, I don't know
how I did it.

37:35.003 --> 37:38.048
I don't even know why I did it.
I just did.

37:38.090 --> 37:40.300
But I can honestly say

37:40.342 --> 37:42.177
I'm a better man
from all of that.

37:45.472 --> 37:48.225
Wow, Miles.

37:48.267 --> 37:51.144
Well,
about your friends, baby,

37:51.186 --> 37:54.356
the Bible says that bad company
corrupts good character.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.109
You really think
this is a wise idea,

37:57.150 --> 37:58.610
still hanging out
with these guys

37:58.652 --> 38:00.445
when they do what they do?

38:00.487 --> 38:02.656
Those are my friends, V.

38:02.698 --> 38:04.533
I mean, those dudes--

38:04.574 --> 38:06.243
they're like my family,

38:06.285 --> 38:08.203
and I can count on them
for anything.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.871
Look, I've been trying
to tell these guys

38:09.913 --> 38:12.874
there's other ways
to make legal money.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.710
I mean, I spent
the last two years of my life

38:14.751 --> 38:18.297
just trying
to wash and shake all that off.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.132
Shake it off, huh?

38:20.173 --> 38:22.342
Look, I'm not
this perfect guy, V,

38:22.384 --> 38:24.845
but I'm trying.

38:29.474 --> 38:33.645
Miles,
that was a mouthful.

38:33.687 --> 38:35.063
To be honest with you, babe,

38:35.105 --> 38:38.483
it almost sounds like
a testimony

38:38.525 --> 38:41.445
of someone who's had their life
turned around by God.

38:44.865 --> 38:46.658
Thank you

38:46.700 --> 38:49.161
for even wanting
to share that with me.

38:49.202 --> 38:50.829
Am I okay with it?

38:53.790 --> 38:55.125
I don't know about all that.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.421
Does it make me
want to pull away from you?

39:01.340 --> 39:04.301
No.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.428
If anything, it...

39:06.470 --> 39:08.388
makes me want to get closer
to you.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.353
Would it be wrong to say

39:14.394 --> 39:16.063
that I'm falling in love
with you?

39:18.398 --> 39:21.360
No, baby,

39:21.401 --> 39:23.362
'cause I'm falling in love
with you, too.

39:43.465 --> 39:46.009
Well, since you just
had the floor, Scarface--

39:46.051 --> 39:48.220
Oh, I'm Scarface now, huh?

39:48.261 --> 39:49.763
Yeah, it's my turn now.

39:49.805 --> 39:52.516
Baby, do you know
what "equally yoked" means?

39:52.557 --> 39:54.851
What do you mean,
like eggs or something?

39:54.893 --> 39:56.436
No, silly.

39:56.478 --> 39:59.731
In the Bible, God refers
to our spirits as equally yoked,

39:59.773 --> 40:04.152
so in order for you and I
to be equally yoked,

40:04.194 --> 40:06.196
it means that we have to feel
the same way

40:06.238 --> 40:08.865
about each other and God

40:08.907 --> 40:12.577
and put Jesus in the center
of this relationship.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.830
Now, do you think
you can do that?

40:14.871 --> 40:16.623
I mean, it sounds
like a whole lot, babe,

40:16.665 --> 40:20.043
but I care about you enough

40:20.085 --> 40:23.296
to give it a try.

40:38.228 --> 40:39.938
Good morning, sunshine.

40:53.285 --> 40:56.621
So it's the big weekend,
eh, Miles?

40:56.663 --> 40:57.664
I hope so.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.416
So these are your events?

40:59.458 --> 41:01.126
Yeah, well, you know,
I got a few partners,

41:01.168 --> 41:02.961
but yeah, for the most part.

41:03.003 --> 41:05.172
Well, we'll say a prayer
for you and your shows tonight.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.631
Thanks, Mr. Leon.
I appreciate it.

41:24.608 --> 41:27.277
Tams, what's going on?

41:27.319 --> 41:28.987
How we looking?
Everything's great.

41:29.029 --> 41:30.572
The groups are checked in
to the hotel.

41:30.614 --> 41:31.907
Sound check's going on
right now.

41:31.948 --> 41:33.116
You got yourself a sellout.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.118
That's what I'm talking about.

Let's go.

Meet me at the spot,

46:46.679 --> 46:48.223
and make sure
nobody follows y'all.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.503
Baby.

47:18.545 --> 47:19.629
Baby, are you all right?

47:19.671 --> 47:21.923
Are you okay?
Babe!

47:21.965 --> 47:23.925
No, I'm not okay, Miles.

47:23.967 --> 47:26.135
Who were those guys?
Were they trying to kill you?

47:26.177 --> 47:28.012
Look, baby, just relax.

47:28.054 --> 47:30.139
Just relax.
It had nothing to do with me.

47:30.181 --> 47:32.058
Look, I was just trying
to defuse the situation.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.309
That's it.

47:33.351 --> 47:34.894
It had nothing to do
with you.

47:34.936 --> 47:36.604
It was between Martin
and whoever that guy was.

47:36.646 --> 47:40.275
So what am I supposed to do,
babe,huh?

47:40.316 --> 47:41.568
Leave him out there alone?

47:41.609 --> 47:43.403
Let some dude
come blow his head off?

47:43.444 --> 47:45.113
Is that what you telling me?

47:45.154 --> 47:46.698
Don't think so, baby.

47:46.739 --> 47:48.491
So you're just willing
to give up everything

47:48.533 --> 47:50.243
including your own life

47:50.285 --> 47:52.537
for something that had nothing
to do with you?

47:52.579 --> 47:54.455
Yeah.

47:54.497 --> 47:57.292
And they would do the same
for me, baby.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.878
Look, a few years ago,

47:59.919 --> 48:03.006
this whole thing would have
turned out a lot different.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.966
I was just trying to get us
out of there safe, baby.

48:05.008 --> 48:05.967
That's it.

48:06.009 --> 48:07.594
Really?

48:07.635 --> 48:09.012
Would you like to tell me

48:09.053 --> 48:11.139
why there was a gun
in your car?

48:11.180 --> 48:12.307
Babe, it's like I told you.

48:12.348 --> 48:13.850
Whenever I do shows like this,

48:13.892 --> 48:15.852
there's always large amounts
of cash around.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.270
You know that!
You see it!

48:17.312 --> 48:19.272
Look!

48:19.314 --> 48:22.692
What do you want me to do?

48:22.734 --> 48:25.695
Listen, I know this whole
situation and everything,

48:25.737 --> 48:28.323
it's all new for you,

48:28.364 --> 48:29.991
but you got to understand,
babe,

48:30.033 --> 48:34.621
when it comes to protecting you,
my family, my friends,

48:34.662 --> 48:37.123
I'll do anything, babe.

48:37.165 --> 48:39.542
You understand that?

48:39.584 --> 48:41.544
I thought
I was gonna lose you.

48:44.213 --> 48:45.590
Come on, baby.

48:45.632 --> 48:47.258
Really, Miles.

48:47.300 --> 48:52.263
I don't ever want to feel
like that again, ever.

48:52.305 --> 48:54.098
Promise me
I won't ever lose you.

48:54.140 --> 48:55.934
I promise.

48:55.975 --> 48:59.228
I ain't going nowhere.

48:59.270 --> 49:00.605
You understand me?

49:05.777 --> 49:07.195
Give me your hands.

49:11.115 --> 49:14.452
Heavenly Father,
we come before You.

49:14.494 --> 49:16.287
We thank You, Lord,
for getting us through

49:16.329 --> 49:18.289
a hard day of work

49:18.331 --> 49:21.334
but most of all
for protecting us.

49:21.376 --> 49:24.170
Lord, we ask
that You would continue

49:24.212 --> 49:27.590
to show Miles that You are
always there with us.

49:27.632 --> 49:30.969
In Your name we pray.

49:31.010 --> 49:32.220
Amen.

49:34.597 --> 49:35.807
Amen.

49:50.238 --> 49:52.198
Whoo!
Yeah!

49:52.240 --> 49:53.408
Happy birthday, baby.

49:53.449 --> 49:55.201
Smile.
Thank you.

49:55.243 --> 49:56.744
Love it.
But you guys--

49:56.786 --> 49:58.746
you guys really didn't
have to do this.

49:58.788 --> 50:01.207
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

50:01.249 --> 50:03.626
Now, Miles, we got you
a little something.

50:03.668 --> 50:06.045
We hope that
you'll not only use it

50:06.087 --> 50:07.255
but enjoy it as well.

50:07.296 --> 50:09.048
Wow.

50:09.090 --> 50:11.009
I mean, y'all really
don't have to do none of this.

50:11.050 --> 50:12.427
This is too much for me
right now.

50:12.468 --> 50:14.012
Go on, Miles.
Open it.

50:14.053 --> 50:15.930
I know!
Hurry up.

50:15.972 --> 50:17.181
Okay, okay.

50:17.223 --> 50:19.809
Let me--
let me open this.

50:19.851 --> 50:22.812
Get out of here.

50:22.854 --> 50:25.273
You guys got me
my own Bible?

50:25.314 --> 50:27.025
Look, it's got my name on it
and everything.

50:27.066 --> 50:29.068
Let me take a picture.
Love it.

50:29.110 --> 50:31.487
Miles, you need to understand
something.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.364
We have done
everything we can

50:33.406 --> 50:36.576
to raise all of our children
in the ways of the Lord.

50:36.617 --> 50:38.369
Now, the Bible says
that we should pray

50:38.411 --> 50:41.581
for our children's spouses
from early in their lives.

50:41.622 --> 50:46.586
Well, we have been praying
for a godly man for Vanessa.

50:46.627 --> 50:49.422
Miles,
are you that godly man?

51:03.728 --> 51:05.104
I don't know.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.372
How come
I can't I figure out

51:23.414 --> 51:24.707
who you really are?

51:33.341 --> 51:34.759
Bet she has no idea.

51:47.730 --> 51:49.482
I see
you're working late again.

51:52.568 --> 51:55.696
I told you we had
a solid case, right?

51:55.738 --> 51:57.907
So if they're working late...

51:57.949 --> 51:59.659
We got to be working late.

52:02.954 --> 52:04.747
If there's something there,

52:04.789 --> 52:05.998
you'll find it.

52:33.693 --> 52:35.486
This ain't for me.

52:38.614 --> 52:39.991
Babe,
after church tomorrow,

52:40.032 --> 52:41.617
you want to go to the movies?

52:41.659 --> 52:43.119
About tomorrow...

52:43.161 --> 52:44.996
I don't think
I'ma be able to make it.

52:49.375 --> 52:50.543
What's the matter, babe?

52:50.585 --> 52:52.378
You all right?

52:52.420 --> 52:53.754
No, Miles,
I'm not all right.

52:53.796 --> 52:56.007
Look, just tell me
what the problem is.

52:56.048 --> 52:57.842
There is no problem,
babe.

52:57.884 --> 52:59.468
I just got some things
I got to take care of tomorrow.

52:59.510 --> 53:00.928
That's all.

53:00.970 --> 53:02.597
We all have a lot of stuff
we have to do.

53:02.638 --> 53:04.432
You're always gonna have
a lot of things you have to do.

53:04.473 --> 53:05.766
Look, I'm gonna put aside
the fact that

53:05.808 --> 53:07.185
my entire family
is expecting you

53:07.226 --> 53:08.603
and that, hey,
I'd actually like you

53:08.644 --> 53:09.979
to come to church with me,

53:10.021 --> 53:11.355
and what I'm really
concerned with

53:11.397 --> 53:12.440
is what the real issue is.

53:12.481 --> 53:13.482
Why don't you just tell me?

53:13.524 --> 53:14.775
There's nothing to tell.

53:14.817 --> 53:16.152
Really?
There's nothing to tell?

53:16.194 --> 53:17.486
Look, I'm not even buying that.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.280
What is so bad
about going to church?

53:19.322 --> 53:21.532
God don't want somebody
like me in his church, okay?

53:25.953 --> 53:27.163
Ridiculous.

53:34.837 --> 53:37.757
What are you smiling about?

53:37.798 --> 53:40.718
Look, babe, I'm not trying
to belittle your feelings.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.470
Look, I'm sorry,

53:42.511 --> 53:44.639
but you're just so off.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.767
Like, so off.

53:47.808 --> 53:51.187
And to be honest,
I'm a little relieved

53:51.229 --> 53:52.605
'cause I thought
you were actually

53:52.647 --> 53:53.814
keeping something from me...

53:53.856 --> 53:55.858
something ugly.

53:55.900 --> 53:59.278
Well, don't be getting
all happy just yet.

53:59.320 --> 54:01.781
I haven't told you
why I feel this way.

54:01.822 --> 54:03.783
It doesn't matter.

54:03.824 --> 54:06.577
God doesn't care about
what you've done in your past

54:06.619 --> 54:08.246
or what you're in the middle of
right now.

54:08.287 --> 54:11.624
He just wants you
to come as you are.

54:11.666 --> 54:13.209
You sure about that?

54:13.251 --> 54:15.169
I'm positive.

54:15.211 --> 54:16.963
Look, the Bible says,

54:17.004 --> 54:20.174
"What causes a man
to gain the whole world

54:20.216 --> 54:23.594
and lose his soul."

54:23.636 --> 54:27.765
Baby, I don't want you
to lose your soul.

54:27.807 --> 54:31.978
Once you really get to know
God and His Word,

54:32.019 --> 54:35.022

54:42.571 --> 54:43.823
Look, please,
better than sex.

54:43.864 --> 54:45.449

Pastor Galley,
how are you today?

58:29.006 --> 58:30.341
I'm wonderful.
How are you?

58:30.382 --> 58:31.800
Fantastic.
It was an awesome worship.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.135
I loved it.
I had a great time, too.

58:33.177 --> 58:34.512

58:39.266 --> 58:41.602
All right, Ma.
See you.

58:41.644 --> 58:42.603
Hey, Pastor Galley.

58:42.645 --> 58:44.021
Vanessa, how are you, Ma?

58:44.063 --> 58:45.814
Pastor Galley,
this is my boyfriend, Miles.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.233
Miles, Pastor Galley.

58:47.274 --> 58:49.235
Miles, you got some church in
today, huh?

58:49.276 --> 58:50.819
Yeah, it wasn't
what I was expecting,

58:50.861 --> 58:52.196
but it was good.

58:52.238 --> 58:53.697
That's right.
That's right.

58:53.739 --> 58:55.199
So you really,
like, a pastor, huh?

58:55.241 --> 58:56.867
I mean, like a real pastor.

58:56.909 --> 58:58.953
As opposed to, like,
an imaginary, cartoon pastor?

59:00.412 --> 59:01.956
Nah, that's not
what I meant, man.

59:01.997 --> 59:03.707
I mean, you don't really look
like a pastor.

59:03.749 --> 59:04.708
I don't, huh?

59:04.750 --> 59:06.126
So what's a real pastor

59:06.168 --> 59:07.795
supposed to look like,
Miles?

59:07.836 --> 59:10.756
I don't know, man.
I mean, look at you, man.

59:10.798 --> 59:12.591
Clothes,
your jewelry...

59:12.633 --> 59:15.886
You're kind of tight to death
yourself there, Miles.

59:15.928 --> 59:19.306
Yeah, but I don't drive
no Lambo, Pastor.

59:19.348 --> 59:20.599
The Lambo, huh?

59:20.641 --> 59:22.434
I recall pulling into
the parking lot

59:22.476 --> 59:24.228
and passing
a four-door black Bentley

59:24.270 --> 59:25.688
that I've never seen here
before,

59:25.729 --> 59:27.731
and I'm assuming that's yours,
man.

59:27.773 --> 59:29.733
Yeah, but I ain't no pastor.

59:29.775 --> 59:31.944
True that, but the last time
I read the Bible,

59:31.986 --> 59:35.739
it said nothing
about style being a sin.

59:35.781 --> 59:37.533
Kind of goes back
to that old saying

59:37.575 --> 59:40.035
that you cannot judge a book
by its cover, you heard?

59:40.077 --> 59:42.121
Yeah, I dig.

59:42.162 --> 59:45.040
So what made you
want to be a pastor anyway?

59:45.082 --> 59:47.459
Well, God had a calling
on my life, Miles,

59:47.501 --> 59:49.878
and as much as I tried
to avoid that call,

59:49.920 --> 59:51.463
I couldn't avoid it anymore,

59:51.505 --> 59:52.923
and here I am.

59:52.965 --> 59:54.717
He's got a calling
on your life, too.

59:54.758 --> 59:55.968
On everybody's life.

59:56.010 --> 59:57.177
But you got to answer
the phone

59:57.219 --> 59:58.971
when He calls, you dig?

59:59.013 --> 01:00:00.306
A calling, huh?

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:02.099
A calling.
I tell you what.

01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:03.726
We'll talk more about that
in the future.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.060
I'd love to see you around here
a little bit more.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.312
All right.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.688
You have a blessed Sunday,
Vanessa.

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:08.939
Such good worship today,
by the way.

01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:10.149
Praise God.
Miles...

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.317
Pastor.
It was a pleasure.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.527
Pleasure's all mine.

01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:15.404
Hope you two
brought your appetites,

01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:17.740
because your mother cooks enough
for an army.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.075
It looks good too, Ma.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.369
So you got Miles
to go to church?

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:24.330
Mm-hmm.
Just this Sunday.

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:26.290
I cannot believe this.

01:00:26.332 --> 01:00:28.500
Vanessa,
you are an angel from heaven.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.044
You just don't know

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:31.837
how hard I've been praying
for this boy.

01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:33.881
Whoo, you and I both.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.382
Mm-hmm.

01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:38.385
Okay, let's say grace.

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:41.055
Dear Lord,
thank You for the food

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.765
we are about to receive

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:45.351
for the nourishment
and health of our bodies,

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:47.645
for our wonderful son, Miles,

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:50.814
and for bringing the beautiful
Vanessa into our lives.

01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:53.859
She is truly
an angel from heaven.

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.736
In Jesus' name we pray.

01:00:55.778 --> 01:00:59.365
Amen.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.075
Now, Vanessa, honey,

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.868
don't you be afraid
to crack the whip on this--

01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:05.329
If he gives you any trouble,

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:06.622
you just let us know.

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:08.040
We'll straighten him out.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.542
All right,
I like the sound of that.

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:12.628
Let's eat.

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:42.866
Man, what took you so long?

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:44.410
Sorry, big dog.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.078
Sorry?
Let me tell you something, man.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.955
Don't ever have me waiting
like that ever again.

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:49.957
You hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.750
Man, here.

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:57.923
125k, man, nice and neat,
just like you like it.

01:01:57.965 --> 01:01:59.174
All right, here, man.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.801
Get out of here.
Get out of my car.

01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:02.428
All right.

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:04.096
See you soon, Martin.
Yeah, whatever.

01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:07.141
Got you.

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.310
Babe, I got a question.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.563
What's up?

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:14.440
Have you considered,
you know,

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.692
taking that walk of faith
during the altar call?

01:02:19.445 --> 01:02:20.654
Babe,
I ain't gonna lie to you.

01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:22.364
What?

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.324
I'm still trying to figure
this whole thing out.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.034
I mean,
I know there's a God,

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.537
and I'm supposed to act
a certain way and everything,

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:31.373
but to be real, babe,

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:34.209
I'm still researching
this whole salvation thing.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.878
I mean, I just don't want
to dive into it.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:37.254
Does that make
any sense to you?

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:39.256
Yes, it makes perfect sense,
babe.

01:02:39.298 --> 01:02:40.466
I get it.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:41.675
I will say this, though.

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:43.135
What will you say?

01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:44.553
I feel real good
when I'm in church.

01:02:44.595 --> 01:02:46.096
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.098
I mean, it feels like
everything's moving

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.601
in the right direction,
you know?

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:52.269
But then I get to thinking,

01:02:52.311 --> 01:02:55.731
if God is this all loving,

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.942
all seeing, all being God,

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:00.736
then why does He allow
things to happen

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:03.363
like rape, murder,

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:04.823
war?

01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:06.617
Like, that part
I don't understand, babe.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:11.246
I see you clearly have been
giving this a lot of thought.

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:14.750
Well, yeah, I mean,
just the other night,

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:18.045
I'm sitting in bed,
and I'm watching this program,

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:20.255
and this Muslim speaker's
speaking,

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.883
and he's talking about
the book that they read,

01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:24.134
the Koran.

01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:25.594
Okay.

01:03:25.636 --> 01:03:27.012
He's basically saying that,

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:28.806
you know, they believe
that Jesus existed

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:31.600
but that he was only
a prophet,

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:34.228
and then he started getting into
all these scientific facts

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:37.105
that exist in the Koran

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:40.651
that, you know,
scientists didn't even discover.

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:42.069
I thought it was--

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.363
I thought it was
really, really interesting.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.615
All right, well,
how did it make you feel?

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.620
To be honest?

01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:52.913
I don't know,

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:56.667
it's a lot to swallow, babe.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.338
All right, well,

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.798
whenever you're ready.

01:04:05.259 --> 01:04:06.844
Whenever you're ready.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.637
Hopefully sooner
rather than later.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.560
Merry Christmas, everybody.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:15.894
Merry Christmas.

01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:18.230
What a special time of year
this is.

01:04:18.272 --> 01:04:20.440
To think that God
would become flesh

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:21.859
and dwell among us,

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.485
that ought to fill our hearts
with joy.

01:04:25.112 --> 01:04:27.906
Vanessa, honey, it was so nice
meeting your family.

01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:30.158
Thank you.
You're all so beautiful.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.786
And with such pretty daughters
as you three,

01:04:32.828 --> 01:04:35.163
it's no wonder your father
turned to the Lord.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.333
Man must spend
a lot of time on his knees.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.002
Amen.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.337
Look, Mom, Dad,
me and V

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.923
want to give y'all
a little something.

01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:46.341
We know y'all been trying
to, you know,

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:47.593
get away
for quite some time,

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.553
so we got y'all something

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:50.971
we think y'all might like.

01:04:51.013 --> 01:04:54.266
Wait a minute, son,
what is this?

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:55.684
Open it up.

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:57.352
Okay.

01:04:59.313 --> 01:05:01.273
Sandals Resorts.

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:03.317
Look at this place.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:05.861
Oh, my gosh, it's the one
we saw in the commercial.

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:08.030
Thank you.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.656
Look at this, honey.

01:05:09.698 --> 01:05:11.658
Son, this is beautiful,
but you shouldn't have.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.118
Aw, come on, Pop.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.870
You and Mom been trying
to get away for years,

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:16.622
so this is our gift to you.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.290
Baby, I love it,

01:05:18.332 --> 01:05:22.836
and I'm so glad to finally
get to go to Sandals.

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:25.380
Sandals, here we come.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.965
Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:28.216
Oh, merry Christmas.

01:06:09.508 --> 01:06:12.010
Listen to this.

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:15.222
"How much more pleasing
is your love than wine,

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:18.600
"sweetness as the honeycomb,
my bride.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.435
"Milk and honey
under your tongue.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:23.105
"Your two breasts
are like two fawns.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.524
"I slept,
but my heart was awake.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:28.151
"Listen, my love is knocking.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.861
"My head is drenched
with dew.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:31.279
"I've taken off my robe.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:33.573
"Must I put it on again?

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:37.828
My lover thrusts his hand
through the latch opening."

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.955
Now, that sounds like
late-night HBO to me.

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:41.456
Hold up.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:43.583
If you could hear
how you just read that...

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:44.710
I read it how it's reading.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.044
That's what it is.

01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:47.754
Babe, okay,
are you trying to say

01:06:47.796 --> 01:06:50.632
that the Bible says
that it's okay to have sex?

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:54.261
Babe, I don't know what
the Bible is saying.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:56.179
I guess I'm just trying
to figure this all out.

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:57.806
That's all.

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:59.766
Babe,
I can almost assure you

01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:01.768
that these people
that they're talking about

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.186
are married.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:04.563
Now, the Bible says you can

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:06.982
totally enjoy
your spouse sexually.

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:09.484
Now, how did you interpret it?

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.236
You know what?

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:13.196
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Just forget about it.

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:14.656
No, no.
That's a good thing.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.241
It's good that
we discuss these things.

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:17.743
Just forget it.

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.453
It's important to discuss
the Word of God.

01:07:19.494 --> 01:07:20.454
Drop it.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:21.580
Really?
Really?

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.136
Y'all in trouble now.

01:07:36.178 --> 01:07:37.387
Uncle Freddie.

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:43.435
Miles, my man, man.

01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:44.895
Marty, what's up?
What's up, baby?

01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:46.271
Where you been at, man?

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:47.856
Ain't seen you around
in a minute.

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:49.399
Just been rippin'
and runnin', baby.

01:07:49.441 --> 01:07:51.109
You know,
rippin' and runnin'.

01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:53.862
Hey, you all right, Miles?

01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:55.113
Don't I look all right?

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:56.698
I mean, not really,

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.033
but if you say so.

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.534
Hey, where's Vanessa at?

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.578
Man, I don't know.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.121
She's around somewhere.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:05.290
She just ain't here with me,
you know?

01:08:05.332 --> 01:08:06.625
So what,
you ready to party

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:09.044
with your boys tonight,
then, or what?

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:10.337
You know what?

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:11.338
Let's do that, man.

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:12.881
Drinks are on me tonight, man.

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.341
I ain't been with y'all
in a minute.

01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:15.717
Let's do what we do.
Let's do it.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:18.011
Keep them coming all night,
beautiful.

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:19.261
Okay, I'll be back.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:21.098
Baby, thank you.

01:08:21.139 --> 01:08:22.933
Hey, yo, Miles,
what's going on with you, man?

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:25.102
For real?
With what?

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.310
With what?

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:27.312
With you, homey.

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:28.604
I mean, we don't ever

01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:29.689
see you around no more, dog,

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.691
and when we do,

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.068
it's never without Vanessa.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.778
You say that to say what?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.615
Look, dog,
I'm just saying, man.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:41.033
You ain't nowhere near
your normal self,

01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:42.702
and to be honest with you,
man,

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:44.662
me and the fellas is just
concerned about you, man.

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:46.038
That's all.

01:08:46.081 --> 01:08:47.499
Look, I just need
a little vacation.

01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:48.917
That's all.
I'm good.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:50.919
Look, dog,
me and you go back, man.

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:54.171
We go back further than
all these cats right here,

01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:56.216
and if there's one thing
I know about you,

01:08:56.258 --> 01:09:00.011
the only thing that can get you
off your square is a girl,

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.596
so if you need
to talk about it,

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:05.058
for real, I'm right here
like I always been, man.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.395
I'm all ears,
but if not,

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:10.522
then that's cool too, man,
'cause I got something else

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:12.232
that can get your mind off that,
you feel me?

01:09:12.274 --> 01:09:13.358
Hey. yo, ladies!

Why, Miles?
Why?

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:50.455
God help me.

01:10:57.337 --> 01:10:59.005
God help me.

01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:15.021
Miles, it's your mama.

01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:16.356
She's very ill.

01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:18.024
Hurry up and get down here.

01:11:18.066 --> 01:11:19.442
No. No.

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:21.278
"But if any of you
lacks wisdom,

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:22.779

01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:25.073
I'm so sorry guys.
It's Miles' dad.

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:29.577
Hello?

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.579
Vanessa, it's Caesar.

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.540
Hi, Mr. Montego, how are you?

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:34.833
Not good.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.001
It's Miles' mom.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.252
She's very ill.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:40.547
Thank God you're here, son.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:43.925
Hey, Pop, how you doing?

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:47.178
I came as soon as I could,
Ma.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.888
How you doing?

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.099
Hi, baby.

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:53.184
I'm sorry.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:55.395
I ruined the trip.
Trip?

01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:57.605
What you talking about,
"trip"?

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:01.026
Don't worry about that,
okay?

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:03.903
You just concentrate
on getting well.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:05.655
How you feeling?

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:10.994
She's under a lot
of medication right now.

01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:14.331
Let's let her rest.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:16.750
Don't worry, son.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.126
It'll be all right.

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.340
Okay.

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:27.719
Miles,
I need to talk to you.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.597
Come on.

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:36.019
Well, son,

01:12:36.061 --> 01:12:37.771
it's not good.

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:39.022
Not good at all.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:44.235
How?

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.071
How does somebody go
from perfectly healthy

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:48.615
to dying overnight?

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:50.825
It wasn't overnight.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.536
Apparently, your mother
lived with this for years,

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:56.623
and you know your mother
and doctors.

01:12:56.664 --> 01:13:00.210
There's no way to know.

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:01.628
Your mother always thought

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:04.506
that an aspirin
could fix everything.

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:10.387
So what do we do now?

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:11.805
They said the best thing to do

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:15.517
is to try to help her
feel comfortable.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:18.061
But, Miles,

01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:22.440
right now, I need you
to be strong for your mama,

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:24.984
okay?

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:27.487
Yeah, Pop.

01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:28.738
Good.

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:40.583
Miles, I'm so sorry.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.504
I can't even imagine

01:13:44.546 --> 01:13:46.172
what you're going through
right now.

01:13:52.387 --> 01:13:55.140
Look,

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:57.600
V, I want to explain
something to you.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:13:59.644
Miles, you don't
have to explain anything.

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:01.312
I know this is not
the right time.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:04.315
It's not the right time.
Just listen to me.

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.484
I don't know
what's going on right now,

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:09.446
but I've never felt
like this.

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:10.947
It's like--

01:14:10.989 --> 01:14:13.658
it's like I'm feeling guilt

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.160
and shame.

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:21.791
It's like--I don't know--
I don't deserve anything.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.251
All at the same time.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:29.424
Then I get confused

01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:32.719
about what I think
God is telling me.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.221
I never feel like
I'm doing the right thing, babe.

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:40.727
I want you to understand
something.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:44.272
Look at me.

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:48.526
I want you to know that
nothing happened that night.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:54.741
Miles, you don't have to--

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:55.992
Hey, babe, just--

01:14:57.869 --> 01:15:01.247
I love you.

01:15:01.289 --> 01:15:04.959
I love you,

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.920
and I would never do anything
to hurt you.

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.719
Is that the whole truth,
Miles?

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:18.181
No question, babe.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:22.644
I believe you, baby.

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:32.737
Vanessa.

01:15:32.779 --> 01:15:35.365
I need you
to do something for me.

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:36.783
Anything you ask me to,

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:38.826
I'll do it.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.161
Don't cry.

01:15:40.203 --> 01:15:42.163
Just listen.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.252
I need you to take care
of Miles for me.

01:15:49.796 --> 01:15:52.382
I know there's a reason

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:55.593
why you two met.

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:58.596
God has something special
for you two.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:02.350
God knew

01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:04.978
that the only way to his heart--

01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:10.358
Was through a woman like you--

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.363
beautiful, wonderful,

01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:16.948
godly woman.

01:16:18.825 --> 01:16:21.786
Please don't ever

01:16:21.828 --> 01:16:25.206
give up on him

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:27.792
if you really love him.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.589
I do.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.048
I really do.

01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:45.602
Baby.

01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:50.773
Now, I want a big wedding

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:54.652
and lots of grandbabies,
okay?

01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:57.280
Ma, don't do this right now.

01:16:57.322 --> 01:16:59.282
You're gonna be fine.

01:16:59.324 --> 01:17:02.619
No, Miles, I'm not,

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.412
so I need you

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:06.581
to keep seeking the Lord.

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:09.834
He's the answer

01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:12.920
to all your problems.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:16.549
He's got big plans for you,
baby.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:21.179
Big plans.

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:29.604
My love.

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:37.654
She's really tired right now.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:40.865
Let her get some rest.

01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:42.700
It's been a long day.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.551
Ma.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:01.636
Ma!

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:07.225
Ma.

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.239
May the Lord
now welcome Julia

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.242
to the table of God's children
in heaven.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.577
With faith and hope
in eternal life,

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:30.081
let us assist her
with our prayers.

01:18:30.123 --> 01:18:33.334
Eternal rest
grant unto her, O Lord.

01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:37.547
May her soul and the souls of
all the faithful departed,

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:39.966
through the mercy of God,

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.634
rest in peace.

01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:42.927
Amen.

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:53.104
Looks like a nice party.

01:18:53.146 --> 01:18:56.357
Have a little respect
for the dead, Brian.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:59.610
You want to send
some flowers?

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:01.654
I just don't see the point
in keeping an eye on him

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:02.864
while he's here.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.699
I don't buy this.

01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:07.702
You don't get to be
where a guy like that is

01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:10.037
and just flip it off.

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:13.082
This guy's smarter
than the average crook.

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:16.294
This could all
be a smoke screen.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:19.297
Maybe.

01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:21.883
You believe in God,
Brian?

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.719
Oh, don't go getting
all religified on me, Jason.

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:28.097
Do you go to church?

01:19:28.139 --> 01:19:29.348
Yes, sir.

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:30.516
Every week,

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:32.310
wife and kids,
Bible study,

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.854
the whole nine yards.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:37.023
You do, huh?

01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:38.566
Why didn't I know that?

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.486
You never asked.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:54.373
Miles?

01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:55.708
I just wanted to tell you

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:57.585
that I am so sorry
for your loss.

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:05.134
Your mother
was a beautiful woman.

01:20:05.176 --> 01:20:06.928
I saw the look on her face

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.221
and felt the warmth of her heart

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:11.724
when she saw you in church.

01:20:11.766 --> 01:20:13.810
I'm sorry
if I haven't always been

01:20:13.851 --> 01:20:17.063
the easiest person
when it comes to you.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:20.608
I want you to know
I'm always praying for you.

01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:26.113
Remember, you may
not always understand

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.033
why God does certain things,

01:20:29.075 --> 01:20:30.868
but I can promise you

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:33.788
that it's all part
of one big plan for your life.

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:40.044
Just know that
this family loves you.

01:20:47.969 --> 01:20:51.055
Thank you.

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:52.515
That means a lot to me.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:06.946
Hey, Mrs. Leon.

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:08.865
Hi, Miles.

01:21:08.906 --> 01:21:12.702
I hope you have an open heart
and mind about this.

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:15.204
I really love your daughter.

01:21:15.246 --> 01:21:16.622
I mean, she means
the world to me.

01:21:20.877 --> 01:21:22.712
I want to spend
the rest of my life with her.

01:21:32.138 --> 01:21:35.099
I want to marry her.

01:21:35.141 --> 01:21:38.060
I mean, with your permission,
of course.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:39.687
It'd be an honor

01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:43.691
to have you as part
of this family, Miles.

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:46.736
Do you think you're
truly ready for this, Miles?

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.988
Well, I know I got a long way
to go, Mrs. Leon...

01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:54.201
...but no one's gonna
love or treat Vanessa

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:56.412
the way I can,

01:21:56.454 --> 01:21:59.624
so, yeah,

01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:01.042
I'm ready.

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:35.868
Uh-oh.
Okay, okay.

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:37.870
Loving it.
Look at you.

01:22:37.912 --> 01:22:39.455
Thank you, baby.

01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:41.290
So you ready for your big
birthday surprise?

01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:42.792
Yes, but seriously,
you're crazy.

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:44.251
Come on, we could have
done something

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:46.545
super simple like dinner.

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:47.546
It ain't too late.

01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:49.131
We could always cancel.

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:51.342
You know,
Jimmy's is open 24 hours.

01:22:51.384 --> 01:22:52.718
That's what we won't be doing.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:53.970
Come on, let's go.

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:05.064
Where are we?

01:23:05.106 --> 01:23:07.692
You know this is crazy,
right?

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.610
Who does this?

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.404
Okay, babe,
is there steps or--

01:23:11.445 --> 01:23:13.447
Come here. Come here.
Okay. Okay.

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:14.532
I'm--hey.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:15.616
Right here.

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:16.867
It's windy.

01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:21.664
Happy birthday, baby.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:28.170
Oh, my gosh.
Are you crazy?

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:29.922
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:31.507
Oh, my--
is this for real?

01:23:33.968 --> 01:23:35.761
Hi, how can I help you, sir?

01:23:35.803 --> 01:23:37.221
I'd like to see
the flight plan

01:23:37.263 --> 01:23:39.056
of that last private jet
that went out, please.

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:40.141
I'm sorry, sir.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:41.434
That information
is confidential.

01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:42.685
It's okay.

01:23:42.727 --> 01:23:43.811
I'm Mr. Confidential.

01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:52.987
Look, babe.

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:54.613
Look out this window.

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.786
Know what I see?

01:24:00.828 --> 01:24:03.664
What?

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.166
I see God, baby.

01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:09.170
You do?

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:11.130
I mean, only He could have
created all this.

01:24:14.592 --> 01:24:16.552
I look, and I see a world
with no limits.

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.975
With the right drive
and hustle,

01:24:23.017 --> 01:24:25.519
anybody could have anything
and everything they want.

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:32.943
It's been a rough
couple of months for me,

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:34.987
but I learned a lot.

01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:36.280
Yeah?

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:37.740
Like what?

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.494
Well, I learned

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:43.537
I'm not as in control of things

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:46.957
as I thought I was.

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:49.710
I learned that life

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:51.629
can be taken away from you
just like that.

01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:57.676
I learned that God is...

01:24:57.718 --> 01:24:59.929
really and truly
in control of all of this.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:07.770
But the most important
thing I learned...

01:25:07.812 --> 01:25:09.021
What?

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:18.114
Is that I never
want to be alone.

01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.407
I never want to be
away from you again, baby.

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:43.139
Vanessa Leon,

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.640
will you marry me?

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:51.772
Miles,

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:53.566
ain't no question.

01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:03.909
Freeze!
Freeze!

01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:05.911
Show me your hands!
Don't move!

01:26:05.953 --> 01:26:07.413

I told you not to--
Shut up!

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.373
Shut up!

01:26:51.415 --> 01:26:52.791
We in this position here.

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:54.210
We got to wait for Miles
to get us out,

01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:55.211
and that's it.

01:26:55.252 --> 01:26:57.671
We here.

01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:02.968
Yo.

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:05.137
Hey, yo, Miles, man, listen,
don't say nothing, okay?

01:27:05.179 --> 01:27:06.430
Just listen.

01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:07.556
We got hemmed up, dog.

01:27:07.598 --> 01:27:09.141
Me, Percy, Chris, Wikki--

01:27:09.183 --> 01:27:10.309
all of us, man.

01:27:10.351 --> 01:27:11.602
We locked up right now.

01:27:11.644 --> 01:27:13.187
You got to be kidding me.

01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:14.855
Man, does is sound like
I'm kidding, dog?

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:15.981
Listen, and to top it off,

01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:17.358
it's the feds that got us.

01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:18.359
The feds?

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.860
Yeah, man.

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:22.154
They set our bail
at $112 million right now.

01:27:22.196 --> 01:27:23.906
All right,
what you want me to do, man?

01:27:23.948 --> 01:27:27.159
Look, dog, I need you to
get us out of here right now.

01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:28.577
All right, I'm on it.

01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:40.214
So what happened?

01:27:40.256 --> 01:27:41.715
Man, they came at us hard,
Miles.

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.259
I mean real hard--

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.262
feds all over the place,
SWAT cars, guns.

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.597
They took us all down
in different places, man.

01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:49.890
It was not good.

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:51.225
They charge you
with something?

01:27:51.267 --> 01:27:52.977
What's the charges?

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:55.104
Man, the indictment had
all kinds of stuff in it, man.

01:27:55.145 --> 01:27:56.647
Still trying
to figure it all out.

01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:58.440
What about the spots?
I mean, was anybody dirty?

01:27:58.482 --> 01:27:59.775
Did they find anything?

01:27:59.817 --> 01:28:01.151
Nah, man,
but I'll tell you this--

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:02.778
they tore my spot up
real good,

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.655
and thank God the only thing
they found was a gun.

01:28:04.697 --> 01:28:05.948
Mine too, man.

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:07.866
They left that joint
a mess, dude.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.785
Yeah, man, them dudes bust
the door down, dog.

01:28:09.827 --> 01:28:12.496
They act like they was looking
for bin Laden or something, man.

01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:13.664
Man, check this out, man.

01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:15.332
They got some of my people,

01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:17.042
but I got my lawyer on it.

01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:18.794
Says he won't know nothing
for a few days

01:28:18.836 --> 01:28:20.212
till he gets the reports back,

01:28:20.254 --> 01:28:23.299
but they was pressing us
really hard, Miles.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.592
Pressing?
About what?

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:27.720
About you.
About me?

01:28:27.761 --> 01:28:29.471
Man, look, this guy told me
I could get up

01:28:29.513 --> 01:28:30.931
and leave right then and there

01:28:30.973 --> 01:28:32.558
if I told them
something juicy about you.

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:33.934
Yep.

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:35.185
Told me the same thing.

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:37.563
This Agent McDaniel dude?

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.565
He got it real bad
for you, Miles.

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:41.608
Yeah, that's real talk,
Miles.

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:44.903
Man, they offered to take me
right back to my house, man,

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:46.989
and forget like any of this
even happened.

01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:48.741
What'd you say?

01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:51.869
Man, I asked them if I could
get ESPN in my cell, man.

01:28:57.875 --> 01:28:59.251
Yeah, what about you?

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:04.548
You really got to ask me that,
Miles?

01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.425
After everything
we've been through?

01:29:06.467 --> 01:29:08.177
I think they was just
fishing for something

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:09.762
and trying to use
me and all the fellas

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:12.306
as bait to get at you.

01:29:12.348 --> 01:29:14.350
I'm buggin'.

01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:17.019
My bad.

01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:20.981
Just stay out of their way
till we can figure this out.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:21.982
I feel you.

01:29:22.024 --> 01:29:23.400
Man, done.

01:29:23.442 --> 01:29:25.444
Thanks a lot, man.

01:29:25.486 --> 01:29:26.695
Thank y'all, man.

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:33.327
Hustle it up, man.
Come on.

01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:42.961
So not one of these guys
gave us anything on Miles.

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:45.964
Not one, sir.

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:47.549
I'm surprised.

01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:51.345
I thought that little guy Chris
would have talked.

01:29:51.387 --> 01:29:52.930
Maybe there's nothing
to tell, Chief.

01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:55.557
What are you saying?

01:29:55.599 --> 01:30:00.771
That Miles is some
squeaky-clean choirboy now?

01:30:00.813 --> 01:30:02.022
Maybe.

01:30:05.401 --> 01:30:06.985
Just get this guy.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:15.661
Let's move out.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.416
Man, Pastor, I'm sorry.

01:30:20.457 --> 01:30:21.959
She's usually on time
for everything.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.669
Hey, don't worry about it,
Miles.

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:26.213
Listen, we spend half our days
waiting on the Lord

01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:29.007
and the other half
waiting on our wives.

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:31.009
Hey, don't tell her
I said that to you, though.

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:32.010
I won't.
I won't.

01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:39.560
Excuse me, Pastor.
I got to take this.

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:40.853
Hello?

01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:42.187
Miles.

01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:43.522
It's Alyssa.

01:30:43.564 --> 01:30:45.357
Hey, Alyssa, what's up?

01:30:45.399 --> 01:30:47.609
Vanessa's been
in a car accident.

01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:51.321
What happened?

01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:54.283
Her car was hit by a truck
that ran a red light.

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:55.409
How is she?

01:30:55.451 --> 01:30:56.785
She's not well, Miles.

01:30:56.827 --> 01:30:58.287
She's still in surgery.

01:31:04.543 --> 01:31:05.794
Mr. And Mrs. Leon?

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:12.885
Well, here's where we're at,
folks.

01:31:12.926 --> 01:31:14.386
She has internal bleeding,

01:31:14.428 --> 01:31:16.430
suffered severe head trauma--

01:31:16.472 --> 01:31:20.017
she's in a coma.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:21.685
Is she gonna be all right,
doc?

01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:23.312
I mean, she gonna live,
right?

01:31:23.353 --> 01:31:24.563
Only time will tell.

01:31:24.605 --> 01:31:25.981
We've done all we can for her.

01:31:26.023 --> 01:31:27.608
We just need to see
how her body reacts

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:30.110
to the procedures
and hope for the best.

01:31:30.152 --> 01:31:31.820
Hope?

01:31:31.862 --> 01:31:33.655
Hope?

01:31:33.697 --> 01:31:36.658
You say hope,
and they say pray.

01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:39.119
I mean, can we all get on
the same page here at least?

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:40.829
Take it easy, son.

01:31:40.871 --> 01:31:42.873
Take it easy?

01:31:42.915 --> 01:31:44.625
You said you've done
all you can for her, doc.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.084
Yes, we have.

01:31:46.126 --> 01:31:47.211
You sure about that?

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:49.630
Miles, please, calm down.

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:51.548
It's in the Lord's hands now.

01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:53.342
"It's in the Lord's hands."

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:56.220
I'm tired of hearing
it's in the Lord's hands.

01:31:56.261 --> 01:31:57.554
I heard that
when my mother died.

01:31:57.596 --> 01:32:00.224
"It's in the Lord's hands."

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:02.017
Look, I'm sorry,
but somebody else

01:32:02.059 --> 01:32:04.436
needs to step in
and take the wheel here,

01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:07.439
'cause it seems like
He is out to lunch.

01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:09.149
Look, I promise you

01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:10.984
I'll do everything I can
to save her life.

01:32:11.026 --> 01:32:12.236
You have my word.

01:32:21.954 --> 01:32:23.497
Look,

01:32:23.539 --> 01:32:25.123
I'm sorry.

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:27.292
There's somebody
I got to go talk to.

01:32:27.334 --> 01:32:29.127
Miles, wait.

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:38.262
Good.

01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:40.222
I'm glad You're here,

01:32:40.264 --> 01:32:44.351
'cause we got some serious
issues to talk about.

01:32:44.393 --> 01:32:46.937
First of all,
You took my mother from me,

01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:48.355
and that just about killed me,

01:32:48.397 --> 01:32:52.317
but I kept my mouth shut
and let that one slide.

01:32:52.359 --> 01:32:56.196
I've done some bad things
to people for a lot less,

01:32:56.238 --> 01:33:00.325
but I've been trying to give You
the benefit of the doubt.

01:33:00.367 --> 01:33:02.869
I've been faithful.

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:04.162
I been going to church,

01:33:04.204 --> 01:33:06.748
reading your
precious little book.

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.959
I even drop stacks of hundreds
every Sunday

01:33:09.001 --> 01:33:13.380
in that little velvet bag
they pass around.

01:33:13.422 --> 01:33:15.591
I've changed.

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:16.758
I'm a changed man,

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.635
can't you see that?

01:33:21.805 --> 01:33:23.307
Oh, my bad.

01:33:23.348 --> 01:33:24.391
Of course You can.

01:33:24.433 --> 01:33:26.518
You see everything, right?

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.730
So what's the problem, then?

01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:33.233
What do You want from me?

01:33:33.275 --> 01:33:35.611
I know I haven't made You proud.

01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:39.573
How could I with
all this mess I got going on?

01:33:39.615 --> 01:33:42.576
What happened?

01:33:42.618 --> 01:33:45.203
What happened to all the things
I've been reading about?

01:33:45.245 --> 01:33:49.333
Grace, forgiveness, mercy?

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:51.209
Where was the mercy
for my mother?

01:33:56.340 --> 01:34:00.844
Now You want to take Vanessa
from me?

01:34:00.886 --> 01:34:06.266
Nah, that ain't gonna happen,
big guy.

01:34:06.308 --> 01:34:09.269
Look, I'm a stand-up guy.

01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:11.146
If anybody needs to pay
for they sins,

01:34:11.188 --> 01:34:12.648
then let it be me.

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:14.858
Please just leave
everybody else out of it.

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:18.111
Just take me!

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:20.113
I'm ready
for whatever You got coming.

01:34:20.155 --> 01:34:22.115
You want to send me to hell,

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:23.617
book the flight!

01:34:25.952 --> 01:34:28.121
But please.

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:30.540
Please.

01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:32.250
I'm begging You.

01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:37.756
Don't take Vanessa from me.

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:44.304
Just tell me.

01:34:44.346 --> 01:34:46.723
Look,
whatever You want me to do.

01:34:46.765 --> 01:34:48.016
Tell me what You want me to do

01:34:48.058 --> 01:34:50.894
to spare her life.

01:34:50.936 --> 01:34:54.856
I didn't mean a word
I just said, Lord.

01:34:54.898 --> 01:34:56.942
I'm sorry for yelling at You
in Your house.

01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:02.030
But, God, You got to know
this is rough on me.

01:35:04.282 --> 01:35:05.659
Just let me know
what I got to do

01:35:05.701 --> 01:35:08.662
to make this right.

01:35:08.704 --> 01:35:10.205
I'll do it.

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:14.710
I surrender, Lord.

01:35:17.796 --> 01:35:19.631
I surrender.

01:35:49.703 --> 01:35:51.037
Okay, Miles,

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:52.581
get out of the car.

01:35:54.166 --> 01:35:55.917
Get out of the car.

01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:58.170
Put your hands in the air

01:35:58.211 --> 01:36:01.631
right now.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.008
Is there a problem,
officers?

01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:04.468
Turn around!

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:06.636
Turn around!

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:08.096
Walk backwards.

01:36:13.435 --> 01:36:17.606
Put your hands on your head.

01:36:17.647 --> 01:36:19.691
Down to your knees.

01:36:28.158 --> 01:36:29.326
House is clear.

01:36:29.367 --> 01:36:30.744
House is clear.
House is clear.

01:36:48.929 --> 01:36:51.807
All right, Miles.

01:36:51.848 --> 01:36:53.642
Now, let's just see
what you're made of.

01:36:59.606 --> 01:37:01.775
Mr. Montego,

01:37:01.817 --> 01:37:05.445
my name's Agent Carey,
and this is Agent Stokes.

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:08.031
We're with the IRS C.I.D.

01:37:08.073 --> 01:37:09.658
You know what that means?

01:37:09.699 --> 01:37:11.368
No,

01:37:11.409 --> 01:37:13.745
but I'm sure
you're about to tell me.

01:37:13.787 --> 01:37:16.998
IRS criminal investigation
division.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.458
All right, yeah, and?

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.085
And, well, Mr. Montego,

01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:22.295
that means that we have
a series of questions for you,

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:26.174
and we would appreciate your
full cooperation with them.

01:37:26.216 --> 01:37:28.677
Do you know these guys,
Miles?

01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:30.053
Yeah, they're friends of mine.

01:37:30.095 --> 01:37:32.222
How good of friends?
Old friends.

01:37:32.264 --> 01:37:33.765
We went to school
and grew up together.

01:37:33.807 --> 01:37:35.058
Why?

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.185
Is that all you did
together, Miles?

01:37:37.227 --> 01:37:39.020
What's that supposed to mean?

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:42.732
It means that they've been
indicted on drug charges.

01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:44.526
It means that we found
these check stubs

01:37:44.568 --> 01:37:47.320
that show large payments
made from your company

01:37:47.362 --> 01:37:49.155
to each of these
individuals.

01:37:49.197 --> 01:37:51.867
It means that this

01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:54.703
looks like you're in business
with these guys,

01:37:54.744 --> 01:37:56.830
and if you are,

01:37:56.872 --> 01:37:58.498
you're in a deep mess.

01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:01.501
First of all,
I'm a legitimate businessman.

01:38:01.543 --> 01:38:05.922
Man, I don't have any illegal
dealings of any kind.

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:09.676
All right,
so I wrote them some checks.

01:38:09.718 --> 01:38:12.220
Last time I checked,
gentlemen,

01:38:12.262 --> 01:38:14.055
that's still legal
in this country.

01:38:14.097 --> 01:38:16.057
Well, that depends on why

01:38:16.099 --> 01:38:18.685
the checks were issued
in the first place.

01:38:18.727 --> 01:38:21.271
I'm a concert promoter.

01:38:21.313 --> 01:38:23.398
They invested
in a few shows of mine.

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.483
Do you know your friends'
source of income?

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:27.569
No, and I don't really care.

01:38:27.611 --> 01:38:29.195
Well, I hate
to tell you this, Miles,

01:38:29.237 --> 01:38:32.240
but their problems are quickly
becoming your problems.

01:38:32.282 --> 01:38:33.491
Oh! yeah?

01:38:33.533 --> 01:38:35.243
What kind of problems
are those?

01:38:35.285 --> 01:38:36.912
It's a problem

01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:39.706
when you use
illegally gotten funds

01:38:39.748 --> 01:38:42.876
to fund even a legit business.

01:38:42.918 --> 01:38:44.669
That makes all
of its gains and assets

01:38:44.711 --> 01:38:47.505
up for grabs to us.

01:38:47.547 --> 01:38:50.884
Make me believe you, Miles.

01:38:50.926 --> 01:38:52.761
I really want to believe you.

01:38:52.802 --> 01:38:55.931
Look, does it look like
I'm trying to hide anything

01:38:55.972 --> 01:38:58.183
from you or anybody else?

01:38:58.224 --> 01:38:59.893
Miles, we're giving you
a chance here

01:38:59.935 --> 01:39:03.605
to save yourself a long
and dirty investigation

01:39:03.647 --> 01:39:05.523
that, in the end,
can only hurt you.

01:39:05.565 --> 01:39:08.902
Fellas, if y'all
want to go down this road,

01:39:08.944 --> 01:39:10.904
let's do it.

01:39:10.946 --> 01:39:14.407
I got a CPA that handles
all my financial affairs.

01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:16.201
I'm sure,
together with my lawyer,

01:39:16.242 --> 01:39:19.788
they can answer any questions
that y'all might have.

01:39:19.829 --> 01:39:25.627
So if y'all gonna charge
and arrest me with something,

01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:28.254
I suggest you go ahead
and do it

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:31.549
so I can bail out
and go on with my day,

01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:34.761
but if not,

01:39:34.803 --> 01:39:37.389
I'd appreciate it
if you showed me the door.

01:39:42.018 --> 01:39:44.229
You have any luck with him?

01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:46.564
Nothing.

01:39:46.606 --> 01:39:50.318
Looks like it's bad guys: 3.
Good guys: 0.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.947
Why don't I give it
just one last shot?

01:39:53.989 --> 01:39:55.198
All right.

01:39:59.828 --> 01:40:02.205
Okay, everybody out.

01:40:02.247 --> 01:40:03.873
Let's go!
Out!

01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:14.300
Real smooth, aren't you?

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:16.511
You got those guys wondering.

01:40:16.553 --> 01:40:20.974
But I think
you're as dirty as sin.

01:40:21.016 --> 01:40:22.934
Yeah, sin.

01:40:22.976 --> 01:40:24.561
Isn't that what you talk about

01:40:24.602 --> 01:40:26.187
in those sweet little
church meetings of yours?

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:27.439
Whatever, man.

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.065
I'm not a churchgoing man,

01:40:29.107 --> 01:40:32.986
but I take guys like you
very seriously.

01:40:33.028 --> 01:40:36.614
So let me give you
the raw and uncut version.

01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:39.075
I'm gonna walk out of here.

01:40:39.117 --> 01:40:40.326
I'm gonna give you
a few minutes

01:40:40.368 --> 01:40:43.163
to gather your thoughts.

01:40:43.204 --> 01:40:46.499
Then I'm gonna come back,

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:50.879
and it's gonna be time
for confession.

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.297
Hey.

01:40:52.338 --> 01:40:55.759
You know confession.

01:41:03.725 --> 01:41:06.936
I think he's clean, Chief.

01:41:06.978 --> 01:41:08.313
Who knows?

01:41:08.354 --> 01:41:11.024
He just might be
that choirboy after all.

01:41:11.066 --> 01:41:13.485
We probably
should just let him go.

01:42:02.283 --> 01:42:04.369
I'm gonna say a prayer.

01:42:08.248 --> 01:42:11.251
Don't laugh at me, okay?

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:13.628
You know I'm new to this.

01:42:23.263 --> 01:42:24.931
Dear God...

01:42:27.517 --> 01:42:30.478
what can I say?

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.065
I give up.

01:42:34.107 --> 01:42:39.362
I finally figured out
that You are who You say You are

01:42:39.404 --> 01:42:41.739
and I can't do nothing
without You.

01:42:45.743 --> 01:42:48.204
I know that You run
this whole thing

01:42:48.246 --> 01:42:50.915
and that everything I have
really belongs to You...

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:57.589
including Vanessa,
even my mom.

01:42:57.630 --> 01:42:59.132
I'm humbly asking You--

01:42:59.174 --> 01:43:01.676
no, I'm begging You, God,

01:43:01.718 --> 01:43:03.970
please,

01:43:04.012 --> 01:43:07.515
please spare her life.

01:43:07.557 --> 01:43:09.309
Please allow her
to come out of this coma

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:13.313
and be healthy again.

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:14.772
I'm here to do or say

01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:17.483
whatever You want me
to say or do, God.

01:43:23.072 --> 01:43:26.242
I know I don't have much
to offer.

01:43:26.284 --> 01:43:30.413
But what I do have is Yours...

01:43:30.455 --> 01:43:34.500
including my heart.

01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:36.920
I want You in my life.

01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:41.549
I want You in my heart, Lord.

01:43:41.591 --> 01:43:45.261
I promise--

01:43:45.303 --> 01:43:46.888
I promise to be
as faithful to You

01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:48.223
as I possibly can.

01:43:51.726 --> 01:43:54.687
I love You,

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:57.315
and I pray all these things

01:43:57.357 --> 01:43:59.525
in Your name,

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:02.946
Christ Jesus.

01:44:02.987 --> 01:44:04.280
Amen.

01:45:46.549 --> 01:45:50.011
You awake?

01:45:50.053 --> 01:45:52.221
Hey, guys, she's awake!

01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:53.848
Come here!
Everybody come in!

01:45:53.890 --> 01:45:55.683
V.

01:46:07.195 --> 01:46:08.404
Good morning, church.

01:46:08.446 --> 01:46:09.697
Good morning.

01:46:09.739 --> 01:46:11.032
Listen,
if you have your Bibles,

01:46:11.074 --> 01:46:12.033
say, "Got it."

01:46:12.075 --> 01:46:13.034
Got it.

01:46:13.076 --> 01:46:15.328
Good.
James 1.

01:46:15.370 --> 01:46:16.662
This is what the Bible says:

01:46:16.704 --> 01:46:18.414
"Consider it pure joy

01:46:18.456 --> 01:46:21.417
"whenever you face trials
of many kinds,

01:46:21.459 --> 01:46:23.544
"knowing that
the trying of your faith,

01:46:23.586 --> 01:46:24.962
"the testing of your faith

01:46:25.004 --> 01:46:27.340
develops perseverance
in your life."

01:46:27.382 --> 01:46:29.092
And we should allow
perseverance

01:46:29.133 --> 01:46:31.094
to have her work in our life,

01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:36.265
because God uses that
to complete us and to mature us.

01:46:36.307 --> 01:46:38.267
And I'm looking at a family here
this morning

01:46:38.309 --> 01:46:42.814
who went through
a severe trial,

01:46:42.855 --> 01:46:45.316
a beast of a trial,
the Leon family.

01:46:45.358 --> 01:46:46.526
And you know, church,

01:46:46.567 --> 01:46:48.611
remember,
we all prayed for them,

01:46:48.653 --> 01:46:51.447
and we asked God
to do a miracle,

01:46:51.489 --> 01:46:53.574
and God did answer our prayers,

01:46:53.616 --> 01:46:56.077
and Vanessa woke up
from her coma,

01:46:56.119 --> 01:46:58.579
and I tell you,
I just want to thank God.

01:46:58.621 --> 01:46:59.914
To God be the glory.
Amen.

01:47:04.961 --> 01:47:06.045
Yes.

01:47:06.087 --> 01:47:07.422
Hallelujah.

01:47:07.463 --> 01:47:09.382
To God be the glory.

01:47:09.424 --> 01:47:11.259
Now,
finally the Bible says this,

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.887
that today is the day
of salvation,

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:18.516
that now
is the acceptable time

01:47:18.558 --> 01:47:20.560
to receive
the Lord Jesus Christ

01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:22.311
as our savior.

01:47:22.353 --> 01:47:23.813
And I'm just going to open up--

01:47:23.855 --> 01:47:25.481
I'd just like you to all
stand with me,

01:47:25.523 --> 01:47:26.983
and I really sense

01:47:27.024 --> 01:47:28.609
that there may be someone
here today

01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:31.612
that would like to come forward
and kneel before us

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:34.073
and say, "Yes,
I'm going to open my life up

01:47:34.115 --> 01:47:35.533
"to the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:47:35.575 --> 01:47:38.619
I'm confessing Jesus
as my Lord today."

01:47:38.661 --> 01:47:41.330
Anyone want to come,
kneel before us

01:47:41.372 --> 01:47:43.416
and open their life

01:47:46.127 --> 01:47:48.629
Excuse me, Pop.

01:47:48.671 --> 01:47:51.466
Where are you going?

01:47:51.507 --> 01:47:53.342
I'll be right back.

01:47:53.384 --> 01:47:55.678

I need to keep.

Yo, fellas,
I hope all of y'all

01:48:42.433 --> 01:48:44.810
are in the best
of health and spirits,

01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:46.687
and I hope y'all
are staying out of trouble,

01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:48.731
'cause I know how y'all like
to wild out.

01:48:48.773 --> 01:48:50.233
Ah, man, I can't tell you

01:48:50.274 --> 01:48:51.943
how much I miss y'all.

01:48:51.984 --> 01:48:55.112
I can't imagine how hard it is
in there.

01:48:55.154 --> 01:48:56.197
And as for me,

01:48:56.239 --> 01:48:58.199
man, what could I say?

01:48:58.241 --> 01:49:02.161
I guess God
has a sense of humor, right?

01:49:02.203 --> 01:49:03.329
Vanessa's doing great.

01:49:03.371 --> 01:49:05.498
She sends her love.

01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.083
Man!

01:49:07.124 --> 01:49:08.167
So much has happened

01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:10.211
over these last couple of years.

01:49:10.253 --> 01:49:12.004
It's been crazy
but all to the good, though,

01:49:12.046 --> 01:49:13.506
you know?

01:49:13.548 --> 01:49:16.175
It's a new season, man.

01:49:16.217 --> 01:49:17.843
I finally turned in
my player card

01:49:17.885 --> 01:49:20.263
and wifed Vanessa.

01:49:25.977 --> 01:49:28.813
Yeah, I took the plunge.

01:49:30.106 --> 01:49:32.608
In more ways than one.

01:49:32.650 --> 01:49:34.026
God has been so good to me.

01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:37.780
Sometimes I can't even
understand it.

01:49:37.822 --> 01:49:40.324
I mean, after all I did
throughout my life,

01:49:40.366 --> 01:49:42.535
and He never gave up on me.

01:49:42.577 --> 01:49:44.161
And if that ain't love,

01:49:44.203 --> 01:49:46.789
I don't know what is.

01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:48.583
I've even been taking
these Bible classes

01:49:48.624 --> 01:49:50.543
just so I can understand
Him and His Word

01:49:50.585 --> 01:49:52.545
a little better.

01:49:52.587 --> 01:49:55.548
Good news is that you guys
are short-timers now.

01:49:55.590 --> 01:49:56.757
Just a little ways to go,

01:49:56.799 --> 01:49:59.427
and it's all over, yo.

01:49:59.468 --> 01:50:03.264
Just remember what
we talked about on our visits.

01:50:03.306 --> 01:50:05.224
God is good,
and He is faithful,

01:50:05.266 --> 01:50:08.561
and I promise
that He's inside those walls

01:50:08.603 --> 01:50:12.773
just as much as He is
out here.

01:50:12.815 --> 01:50:15.401
I sent some money
to your books already,

01:50:15.443 --> 01:50:16.861
and it should be enough
to last y'all

01:50:16.902 --> 01:50:18.696
until you get out.

01:50:18.738 --> 01:50:21.699
Man, I love y'all, man.

01:50:21.741 --> 01:50:24.160
Can't wait to see you out here
in real clothes.

01:50:28.998 --> 01:50:31.375
Steaks are on me, baby.

01:50:31.417 --> 01:50:35.212
Love, respect, and blessings,

01:50:35.254 --> 01:50:38.215
Miles.

01:50:38.257 --> 01:50:40.301
P.S. You guys
are gonna be uncles soon,

01:50:40.343 --> 01:50:42.219
so straighten up,

01:50:42.261 --> 01:50:44.764
'cause I don't want my kid
around no knuckleheads, you dig?

01:50:52.855 --> 01:50:54.148
Okay, Mama, look,

01:50:54.190 --> 01:50:56.359
Daddy's about to preach.

01:50:59.528 --> 01:51:00.696
Good morning.

01:51:00.738 --> 01:51:02.114
Good morning.

01:51:02.156 --> 01:51:05.326
I'm Pastor Miles,

01:51:05.368 --> 01:51:08.412
and today...

01:51:08.454 --> 01:51:10.831
today, we're gonna talk
about change.

01:51:37.608 --> 01:51:38.693
It's important to me, man.

01:51:38.734 --> 01:51:40.653
I'm serious.

01:51:40.695 --> 01:51:42.071
We'll deal with Marty,
though--

01:51:42.113 --> 01:51:43.698
I mean,
we'll deal with Jesse.

01:51:43.739 --> 01:51:44.782
Here's my cash right here.

01:51:44.824 --> 01:51:45.783
T-bone's in.

01:51:45.825 --> 01:51:47.118
I don't mean t--

01:51:50.496 --> 01:51:51.539
No worry.

01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:52.665
Can you get out of my light?

01:51:52.707 --> 01:51:53.916
I'm joking.

01:51:56.335 --> 01:51:57.795
Sweep the leg.

01:52:06.178 --> 01:52:08.222
Let me get
another round of those.

01:52:08.264 --> 01:52:11.267
Hey, Jesse, let me--
dang it.

01:52:13.519 --> 01:52:15.563
Hello, I'm Miles Montego.

01:52:16.689 --> 01:52:17.690
You are?

01:52:24.739 --> 01:52:26.073
Oh, "Jerry," please,

01:52:26.115 --> 01:52:27.533
and it's my pleasure
to meet you.

01:52:27.575 --> 01:52:29.326
But, uh--
what--

01:52:31.579 --> 01:52:33.289
That's what we won't
be doing.

01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:35.291
Oh, I can't dis Jimmy's,
though, right?

01:52:39.628 --> 01:52:41.881
I mean, you say hope,
and they say pray.

01:52:43.132 --> 01:52:44.717
I mean, can we get an--

01:52:47.762 --> 01:52:49.263
My bad, y'all.

01:52:49.305 --> 01:52:53.058
Yes, I'd like to see
the flight pa--

01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:54.143
Back to one?

01:52:55.936 --> 01:52:59.315
I'm--I'm feeling
bloopers reel here, baby.

01:52:59.356 --> 01:53:00.357
All right.

01:53:01.776 --> 01:53:03.027
Oh, hold on.
I got to take this.

01:53:03.068 --> 01:53:04.403
Hello?
Okay, good talking to you.

01:53:04.445 --> 01:53:05.654
