WHAT DO WE CALL HIM?

04:10.625 --> 04:12.583

(chuckles)

04:28.083 --> 04:29.250
OKAY?

04:29.291 --> 04:31.041

04:31.083 --> 04:33.041
YOU'VE MANAGED THE IMPOSSIBLE,

A GOOD RELATIONSHIP

04:35.083 --> 04:37.041

04:57.709 --> 04:59.041
HI, SHELDON.

04:59.083 --> 05:01.917
I-I WAS WONDERING, I RUN
A COUPLES' THERAPY GROUP,

05:01.959 --> 05:03.917
AND MY CO-LEADER IS DOWN
WITH A STOMACH BUG,

05:03.959 --> 05:05.917
AND--AND I THINK
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

05:05.959 --> 05:08.875
THAT WE HAVE A MALE
AND FEMALE THERAPIST--

05:08.917 --> 05:10.875
YOU KNOW, ROLE MODELING
AND COMMUNICATION MODELING.

05:10.917 --> 05:14.542
AND, UH, I WONDERED
IF YOU'D LIKE TO FILL IN.

05:14.583 --> 05:17.333
I KNOW, NOT SUCH A GREAT IDEA
CONSIDERING, BUT...

05:17.375 --> 05:19.583
UH, NO, NO. I-I, UH,
I THINK IT'S GOOD.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.083
I LIKE WORKING WITH COUPLES.
ARE YOU SURE?

05:22.125 --> 05:23.709
YEAH. WHAT TIME?

05:23.750 --> 05:25.792
OUR CONFERENCE ROOM AT 1:00.
IT'S LUNCHTIME.

05:25.834 --> 05:29.041
OKAY, SEE YOU THEN.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.041
VIOLET.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.500
HOW IS IT... THE BABY?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.208
IT'S FINE.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.709
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD
THAT IT'S FINE, BECAUSE--

05:37.750 --> 05:39.709
SHELDON, I WOULD
REALLY APPRECIATE IT

05:39.750 --> 05:41.709
IF WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THIS
RIGHT NOW,

05:41.750 --> 05:44.625
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE IT. OKAY?

05:44.667 --> 05:46.542
BUT I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.125
HEY, PETE.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.625
OH, YOU GOT THAT LOOK--

05:57.667 --> 06:00.834
THAT "IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO DECIPHER VIOLET" LOOK.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.834
I'VE JUST GIVEN UP.
I'M GOING WITH COOL.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.834
NOT COLD, JUST COOL.
OH, HELL. I'LL GO WITH COLD.

06:05.875 --> 06:08.125
YEAH. THERAPY
SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.750
YOU AND VIOLET
ARE IN THERAPY?

06:10.792 --> 06:13.125
(laughs) OH, NO. NO,
WE'RE DOING THERAPY TOGETHER.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.000
IT'S A COUPLES' GROUP.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.959
YOU'RE LEADING IT
AS A COUPLE?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.041
YES, WE ARE.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.417
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
(laughs)

06:22.458 --> 06:25.125
(elevator bell dings)

06:25.166 --> 06:28.375
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE LOOK
ON THEIR FACES, NAOMI.

06:28.417 --> 06:31.208
IT WAS AWFUL,
LIKE THIS IS THEIR FAULT.
HEY.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.041
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT? HUH?

06:33.083 --> 06:36.041
NO, WHAT, UH...
YEAH, WHAT DO WE TELL THEM?

06:36.083 --> 06:38.583
WELL, I WISH I HAD
A GOOD ANSWER,

06:38.625 --> 06:41.792
BUT THE BABY DOES HAVE
11-BETA HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.000
WHAT IS IT?
IT IS AN ENZYME DEFICIENCY

06:44.041 --> 06:46.000
THAT CAUSES AN OVERPRODUCTION
OF TESTOSTERONE

06:46.041 --> 06:48.625
IN THE BABY IN UTERO.

06:48.667 --> 06:52.667
THAT'S WHY THE BABY HAS BOTH
MALE AND FEMALE SEX ORGANS.
KARYOTYPE IS X-X.

06:52.709 --> 06:55.041
SO THE BABY'S A GIRL?
WELL, NO.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.041
YES, GENETICALLY,
IT IS A GIRL,

06:57.083 --> 07:00.583
BUT ABOUT 30% OF THESE CASES,
THESE KIDS ORIENT TOWARDS MALE.

07:00.625 --> 07:03.917
SO WE CAN'T TELL THE PARENTS
WHAT SEX THE BABY IS?
WELL, THEY'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE,

07:03.959 --> 07:06.041
AND THEN WE CAN SURGICALLY
CORRECT THE GENITALIA.

07:06.083 --> 07:09.333
WAIT, YOU JUST SAID THERE'S
A 30% MARGIN FOR ERROR.
POST-OPERATIVE HEALING
IS FASTER

07:09.375 --> 07:11.458
AND IT LEAVES
THE GENITALIA FUNCTIONAL.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.458
I'LL SUPPORT IT
WITH HORMONE THERAPY.
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
THEY CHOOSE WRONG,

07:14.500 --> 07:17.542
AND THE BABY ORIENTS
THE OTHER WAY?
EXACTLY. WE SHOULD HAVE THEM
CHOOSE THE GENDER NOW,

07:17.583 --> 07:19.667
BUT NOT DO SURGERY.

07:19.709 --> 07:22.667
LET THEM THE RAISE THE BABY
AS A BOY OR A GIRL,

07:22.709 --> 07:25.041
AND THEN WHEN THE BABY
BECOMES AN ADOLESCENT,

07:25.083 --> 07:27.750
IT MAKES UP ITS OWN MIND.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
LEAVING IT AN "IT."

07:27.792 --> 07:29.875
EVERY SLEEPOVER, EVERY--
EVERY SWIM PARTY OR LOCKER ROOM

07:29.917 --> 07:32.875
IS GONNA BE CAUSE FOR PANIC.
WELL, MAYBE IT SHOULD BE
WHATEVER IT IS

07:32.917 --> 07:36.041
AND NEVER LOP OFF
ANY BODY PARTS.
OH, AND I WAS WORRIED
I'D BE MISSING ALL THE FUN.

07:36.083 --> 07:37.917
LOPPING OFF BODY PARTS?

07:37.959 --> 07:39.917
INTERSEX BABY.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.291
MM. CAN OF WORMS.
(laughs)

07:41.333 --> 07:43.291
SOME PEOPLE THINK
GENDER IS HARDWIRED,

07:43.333 --> 07:46.083
SO WHATEVER YOU DO, IT'S NOT
GONNA CHANGE THE OUTCOME.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.792
ME? I FIND IT FREAKISH.
LOP AWAY.
(chuckles) HOW WAS
YOUR FIRST DAY BACK?

07:48.834 --> 07:51.041
MM. IT'S PERFECT NOW.
MM.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.458
(kisses)

07:53.500 --> 07:56.000
(clears throat)

08:03.500 --> 08:05.458
GOOD MORNING, DR. KING.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.041
(exhales deeply)

08:07.083 --> 08:10.542
MOVE IN WITH ME, COOPER.

08:10.583 --> 08:11.959
CHARLOTTE--

08:12.000 --> 08:14.500
I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT
VIOLET AND HER BABY.

08:14.542 --> 08:18.041
AND I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WANTED
TO MOVE IN WITH HER.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.333
BUT YOU CAN STILL BE THERE
FOR BOTH OF THEM

08:20.375 --> 08:22.959
WITHOUT LIVING AT HER PLACE.
VIOLET'S AFRAID TO BE ALONE.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.041
SO I NEED TO BE THERE
FOR HER.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.709
I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
AND I AM HERE FOR YOU.

08:27.750 --> 08:31.083
AND LIVING WITH VIOLET,
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT.

08:31.125 --> 08:33.291
(sighs)

08:33.333 --> 08:36.041
MY PATIENCE ONLY GOES
SO FAR.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.291
(man) SO...

08:38.333 --> 08:39.917
IT'S A BOY,

08:39.959 --> 08:41.959
BUT IT COULD ALSO BE A GIRL?

08:42.041 --> 08:43.959
MY GOD. WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.542
HOW DO WE DECIDE?

08:45.583 --> 08:47.542
WELL, THE ODDS SAY
THAT YOUR BABY

08:47.583 --> 08:49.750
WILL MOST LIKELY IDENTIFY
AS A FEMALE,

08:49.792 --> 08:52.125
SO WE CAN DO
CORRECTIVE SURGERY

08:52.166 --> 08:54.333
AND GIVE THE BABY
THE APPROPRIATE GENITALIA.

08:54.375 --> 08:57.542
YOU--YOU WANT TO TAKE MY BABY--
MY SON--AND CUT OFF HIS PENIS?

08:57.583 --> 09:00.625
ALTERNATELY, YOU CAN CHOOSE
A GENDER NOW, RAISE THE BABY,

09:00.667 --> 09:04.125
AND THEN WHEN HE OR SHE MATURES,
YOU REEVALUATE.

09:04.166 --> 09:07.458
AND HIDE THIS
FOR HIS ENTIRE CHILDHOOD?
WHAT WOULD WE TELL HIM?
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU--

09:07.500 --> 09:11.250
HOW DO YOU EVEN BEGIN TO
EXPLAIN THIS TO A LITTLE KID?
WELL, THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S
THE SAME,

09:11.291 --> 09:13.250
THAT IT'S OKAY
TO BE DIFFERENT.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.041
BUT IT'S NOT OKAY.
KIDS ARE CRUEL.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.792
ONE KID SEES HIM
IN THE BATHROOM,

09:17.834 --> 09:19.375
EVERYONE'S TALKING,
TEASING HIM.

09:19.417 --> 09:22.417
I MEAN, THAT'S--
THAT'S WHAT KIDS DO.

09:22.458 --> 09:26.041
THAT'S NOT THE LIFE WE WANT.
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

09:26.083 --> 09:28.834
WE NEED TO PUT THIS BEHIND US,
BEHIND HIM OR HER

09:28.875 --> 09:30.917
AND MAKE IT RIGHT.

09:30.959 --> 09:33.291
BUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY?

09:40.083 --> 09:43.041
I LIKE WOMEN.
I LIKE A LOT OF WOMEN.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.166
BUT I AM NOT MARRIED
TO NAOMI,

09:45.208 --> 09:48.166
AND SHE IS NOT THE MOTHER
OF MY CHILDREN.
NAOMI SAT BY YOUR SIDE
WHILE YOU HAD SURGERY,

09:48.208 --> 09:49.834
SHE HELD YOUR HAND.

09:49.875 --> 09:51.834
YOU'RE UPSTAIRS STICKING
YOUR TONGUE DOWN HER THROAT,

09:51.875 --> 09:53.625
SEEING HER EVERY DAY,

09:53.667 --> 09:56.625
LETTING HER BELIEVE THAT YOU TWO
HAVE SOMETHING TOGETHER--
WELL, I THOUGHT I WAS DYING.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.041
YOU ARE...

09:58.083 --> 10:00.625
YOU ARE ASKING ME
TO LIE FOR YOU.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.041
(voice breaks) YOU ARE MAKING ME
FEEL DIRTY AND CHEAP,

10:03.083 --> 10:05.083
AND I'M 10 YEARS OLD AGAIN
TELLING MOTHER

10:05.125 --> 10:07.041
THAT I WENT OUT
FOR ICE CREAM WITH DADDY

10:07.083 --> 10:09.208
WHEN REALLY
I'M SITTING IN HIS OFFICE

10:09.250 --> 10:11.834
WHILE HE'S SCREWING
HIS SECRETARY DOWN THE HALL.
I'M TOO MUCH OF A SNOB
TO SCREW SECRETARIES.

10:11.875 --> 10:15.083
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?!
NO. I THINK THAT
YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

10:15.125 --> 10:16.667
I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOMETHING

10:16.709 --> 10:19.291
ABOUT YOU DOING YOUR HUSBAND'S
BEST FRIEND BEHIND HIS BACK.

10:19.333 --> 10:22.291
THAT WAS ONCE. I SLIPPED ONCE.
OH, OKAY, SO YOU'RE LIKE--
YOU'RE LIKE AN ALCOHOLIC?

10:22.333 --> 10:24.709
YOU'RE ON A PROGRAM...
OH, MY GOD. YOU...

10:24.750 --> 10:28.125
"GOD GRANT ME THE SERENITY"
AND ALL THAT CRAP?
ARE SO MEAN WHEN YOU KNOW
THAT I AM RIGHT.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.125
YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM MEAN

10:30.166 --> 10:32.917
WHEN I WANT YOU
TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
I WON'T KEEP
YOUR SECRETS FOR--

10:32.959 --> 10:34.375
YES, YOU WILL.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.041
MONTGOMERYS
LOOK THE OTHER WAY

10:36.083 --> 10:39.125
WHEN IT IS
NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.125
NOW THERE'S A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.291
I GOT PATIENTS
LINED UP FOR WEEKS

10:43.333 --> 10:46.125
WAITING FOR YOU TO GET BACK.
WELL, THAT'S ME--
MONEY IN THE BANK.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.917
I LIKE MONEY IN THE BANK.

10:48.959 --> 10:51.458
WHAT?

10:51.500 --> 10:53.083
I LIKE YOUR BROTHER.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.625
HE'S MY GOLDEN BOY.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.709
BEVERLY.

11:04.750 --> 11:05.709
HI.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.083
YOU OKAY?

11:07.125 --> 11:09.709
OH, YEAH, YEAH, I'M FINE.
I JUST, UH...

11:09.750 --> 11:12.417
I HAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME
THIS WEEK.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.041
WELL, I CHECKED YOUR SCHEDULE.
I KNOW YOU HAVE AN OPENING.
BEVERLY--

11:15.083 --> 11:17.709
OH, COME ON, PETE.
JUST A QUICKIE.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.750
OKAY.

11:22.959 --> 11:25.083
I FEEL LIKE PAUL DOESN'T SHARE
MUCH OF HIMSELF WITH ME EITHER.

11:25.125 --> 11:28.000
HE HARDLY WANTS
TO HAVE SEX ANYMORE.
I GET HOME FROM WORK,

11:28.041 --> 11:30.417
I'M TIRED, AND YOU DON'T SEEM
THAT INTERESTED.

11:30.458 --> 11:32.417
BUT WHEN I ASK YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON,

11:32.458 --> 11:34.250
YOU WON'T TALK TO ME.

11:34.291 --> 11:37.625
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU UP HERE.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.041
SEE, THERE'S
YOUR FIRST MISTAKE,

11:40.083 --> 11:43.625
THINKING MUCH OF ANYTHING
GOES ON FOR US GUYS UP HERE.

11:43.667 --> 11:46.041
(men chuckle)
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK, GREG?

11:46.083 --> 11:48.041
I THINK WE GUYS LIKE WOMEN
TO THINK THAT.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.750
MAYBE WE THINK IT OURSELVES,
BUT PART OF THAT

11:50.792 --> 11:52.625
IS THAT WE DON'T LOOK
AT OURSELVES,

11:52.667 --> 11:55.041
DON'T ASK OURSELVES WHAT WE'RE
THINKING OR FEELING.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.542
(Violet) EXACTLY.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.542
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS,

11:58.583 --> 12:01.041
ALL OF US HAVE THINGS
GOING ON INSIDE.

12:01.083 --> 12:04.166
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW,
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM,

12:04.208 --> 12:06.041
SHELDON AND ME INCLUDED,

12:06.083 --> 12:08.417
HAVE A THOUSAND THINGS
GOING ON.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.417
AND THE TRICK IS
TO OPEN YOURSELF TO THAT

12:10.458 --> 12:12.041
AND TO SHARE IT.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.583
WELL, THAT--THAT'S NOT
TO SAY, OF COURSE,

12:14.625 --> 12:18.041
THAT THERE AREN'T PIECES
YOU WANT TO KEEP TO YOURSELF.

12:18.083 --> 12:21.041
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOURSELF
IN A RELATIONSHIP.
NO.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.792
NO, BUT THE BEAUTY
OF GOOD COMMUNICATION

12:22.834 --> 12:24.667
IS THAT WHEN YOU SHARE--

12:24.709 --> 12:26.667
SHARE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,
GOOD OR BAD--

12:26.709 --> 12:28.041
YOU BOTH FEEL BETTER,

12:28.083 --> 12:30.834
MAYBE HELP EACH OTHER.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.792
RYAN AND I USED TO HAVE THAT.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.792
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL
WHEN WE MET,

12:35.834 --> 12:38.208
WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING.

12:38.250 --> 12:42.250
AND NOW ALL YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT ARE THE KIDS.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.250
BUT I'M THERE
WITH THEM ALL DAY.

12:44.291 --> 12:46.417
Y-YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT?

12:46.458 --> 12:49.667
THAT'S MY WORLD.

12:49.709 --> 12:52.083
I KNOW IT'S HARD,
HERE, IN THE GROUP,

12:52.125 --> 12:57.000
BUT TALKING--IT REALLY WILL
MAKE THINGS BETTER.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.542
BEVERLY...

13:05.583 --> 13:07.917
I LOVE SEEING YOU,

13:07.959 --> 13:09.542
BUT THIS HAS GOTTA STOP.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.333
I CAN'T STAY AWAY.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.375
WHATEVER YOU DO, WHENEVER YOU
PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME,

13:14.417 --> 13:16.917
I SWEAR, IT'S, UH... MAGIC.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.917
IT'S NOT MAGIC,
AND IT'S NOT--

13:18.959 --> 13:21.917
HEY, I'VE BEEN READING UP
A LOT ON REIKI THERAPY,

13:21.959 --> 13:23.291
HEALING HANDS.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.333
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
INCREDIBLE. LET'S TRY IT.

13:25.375 --> 13:29.166
I'M NOT A SPECIALIST AT REIKI.
I CAN'T DO THAT.
PETE, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO ME.

13:29.208 --> 13:32.458
AS A DOCTOR, I CAN'T
KEEP PRETENDING THIS IS OKAY.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.917
COME ON.
JUST ONE MORE TIME.

13:35.959 --> 13:37.291
IT'S BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.

13:37.333 --> 13:40.041
IF YOU COULD JUST FILE IT,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANKS.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.667
HI.
HELLO.

13:41.709 --> 13:44.333
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVEN'T
BEEN SPEAKING FOR TWO WEEKS.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.959
I... MISS YOU.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.959
DON'T TREAT ME LIKE
THE PERVERT NEXT DOOR.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.750
IF YOU LIVED NEXT DOOR,

13:49.792 --> 13:52.750
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING
THE PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT TO GET PAST THIS.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.750
WE NEED TO GET PAST THIS.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.041
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE
FOR YOU TO FORGIVE ME?

13:57.083 --> 13:59.333
I DON'T KNOW, COOPER.
I'M WORKING ON IT.

14:25.417 --> 14:28.000
WE WALKED PAST YOUR WALL
OF PICTURES--

14:28.041 --> 14:32.417
ALL THOSE KIDS--HAPPY
AND SWEET AND, UH, NORMAL.

14:32.458 --> 14:35.542
AND THAT'S WHAT...
OUR BABY SHOULD BE.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.125
AND SURGERY CAN DO THAT.

14:37.166 --> 14:40.166
SURGERY CAN GIVE YOUR BABY
GENDER-DISTINCT GENITALIA, YES.

14:40.208 --> 14:44.250
AND WE CAN KNOW?
WE CAN STOP SAYING... "IT"?

14:44.291 --> 14:46.333
GREAT. SO LET--
LET'S DO THAT.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.041
CAN WE DO IT SOON?

14:48.083 --> 14:50.583
I CAN BOOK AN O.R.
FOR TOMORROW.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.625
AFTERWARD, WE'LL SUPPLEMENT
WITH ESTROGEN

14:52.667 --> 14:55.041
SO SHE'LL BE AS HEALTHY
AS POSSIBLE.

14:55.083 --> 14:58.709
NO. NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.709
IT WAS CLEAR TO US FROM
THE SECOND WE SAW HIS FACE--

15:01.750 --> 15:04.291
HE'S... HE'S MATTHEW.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.834
BUT ONLY 30% OF THESE BABIES
ORIENT TOWARD MALE.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.709
YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW.
WE KNOW.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.583
HE'S OUR SON.

15:12.625 --> 15:15.083
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE US
OUR SON.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.166
(sighs)

15:22.083 --> 15:24.625
I JUST SAW RYAN
AND ELEANOR IN THE STAIRWELL.

15:24.667 --> 15:27.041
YOU MEAN RYAN AND SASHA?
N-NO,
I MEAN RYAN AND ELEANOR.

15:27.083 --> 15:30.041
THEY WERE COMMUNICATING,
LIP-TO-LIP.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.834
D-DID THEY SEE YOU?

15:31.875 --> 15:33.291
NO, THEY WERE TOO FOCUSED.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.291
(sighs)
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.291
MAYBE IT'S A CRY FOR HELP.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.834
A-AN AFFAIR IN A STAIRWELL
AFTER MARRIAGE COUNSELING

15:39.875 --> 15:42.834
IS A CRY FOR HELP?
WELL, THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

15:42.875 --> 15:44.208
IN THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIPS,

15:44.250 --> 15:46.959
SO THEY DO THIS AWFUL THING
WHERE THEY COULD GET CAUGHT

15:47.000 --> 15:49.333
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FORCE
THE COMMUNICATION.
ONLY WE CAN'T TELL ON THEM.

15:49.375 --> 15:51.333
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY
DISCLOSED THIS IN SESSION.

15:51.375 --> 15:54.333
I DON'T THINK
THE WAIVERS APPLY.
WELL, I'M NOT SUGGESTING
OUTING THEM.

15:54.375 --> 15:56.875
I'M JUST SAYING,
WE GET THEM TO TELL.
HOW IS EXPOSING AN AFFAIR
GOING TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION?

15:56.917 --> 15:58.667
SO WE LET THE SECRET
KEEP FESTERING

15:58.709 --> 16:00.750
TILL IT POISONS
EVERY ASPECT OF THE GROUP?

16:00.792 --> 16:02.667
IT'LL BECOME THE 800-POUND
GORILLA IN THE ROOM.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.667
AS THERAPISTS, WE NEED
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GORILLA

16:04.709 --> 16:07.667
AND TAKE STEPS
TO DEAL WITH IT.
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY FEEL ABOUT THIS.

16:07.709 --> 16:10.041
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT IT.

16:10.083 --> 16:13.000
THEY COULD BE IN LOVE.
THIS COULD BE A ONETIME THING.
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED
TO TALK TO THEM.

16:13.041 --> 16:15.542
LOOK, WHAT I THINK--
AS BAD AS THIS IS,

16:15.583 --> 16:17.041
GETTING THEM TO CONFESS

16:17.083 --> 16:20.041
COULD BE THE BREAKTHROUGH
THE GROUP NEEDS.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.667
(Naomi) I WAS SURPRISED
THAT YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND

16:22.709 --> 16:25.250
ABOUT DOING THE SURGERY.
WELL, I CAN HELP THEM, NAI.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.458
YOU KNOW, THE THOMPSONS,
THEY ARE DESPERATE

16:27.500 --> 16:29.458
TO CHANGE THEIR SITUATION,

16:29.500 --> 16:32.792
FOR THEM AND FOR THE BABY.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.834
AND... YOU MADE
A VERY GOOD CASE

16:34.875 --> 16:37.834
THAT SURGERY IS THE ONLY WAY
TO REALLY DO THAT.

16:37.875 --> 16:40.166
I DID, BUT, UH... A BOY?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.166
THE ODDS ARE
STACKED AGAINST THAT.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.583
GENDER'S NOT MY CHOICE.
IT'S THEIRS.

16:44.625 --> 16:47.041
AND THEY WANT HIM PAST THIS.
THEY WANT HIM BETTER,

16:47.083 --> 16:49.208
AND I CAN HELP.
HEY, SPEAKING OF BETTER...

16:49.250 --> 16:52.208
I WAS THINKING OF BORROWING
ARCHER FOR A FEW DAYS.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.041
A WEEKEND IN PALM SPRINGS.

16:54.083 --> 16:57.041
YOU KNOW, SLEEPING LATE,
GETTING MASSAGES--

16:57.083 --> 16:58.709
NAI.
WHAT?

16:58.750 --> 17:01.041
DO--DO YOU THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

17:01.083 --> 17:05.041
A TRIP WITH ME?
NO, NO. I MEAN, JUST,
YOU KNOW, UM... HEALTHWISE.

17:05.083 --> 17:08.041
OH, HE--HE CAN GO BACK TO WORK,
BUT--BUT... (laughs)

17:08.083 --> 17:10.166
GOING TO A SPA
IS STRENUOUS?
(laughs) NO, NO, NO.

17:10.208 --> 17:12.208
BUT I MEAN, YOU KNOW ARCHER.
I MEAN, HE'S--HE'S--

17:12.250 --> 17:14.208
HE'S GONNA WANT
TO PLAY GOLF, TENNIS.

17:14.250 --> 17:18.041
HE'LL--HE'LL PUSH HIMSELF.
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.750
NO! NO. I DO--IT'S JUST...
WHY RUSH IT?

17:20.792 --> 17:23.375
BECAUSE I WANT TO GO AWAY
WITH MY BOYFRIEND,

17:23.417 --> 17:26.750
LIKE A WOMAN,
LIKE A-A WOMAN WITH A LOVER.

17:26.792 --> 17:28.125
LOVER?

17:28.166 --> 17:30.333
LOVER. I LIKE THAT.

17:30.375 --> 17:33.041
THAT'S A LOT BETTER
THAN BOYFRIEND.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.583
HE'S MY LOVER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LOVER.

17:35.625 --> 17:38.000
EH, NO.
YEAH, IT SOUNDS STUPID.

17:38.041 --> 17:40.041
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SOAP OPERA.
NO, NO, IT'S NOT--

17:40.083 --> 17:43.000
WHAT ABOUT PARAMOUR?

17:49.291 --> 17:52.000

OH. I'M SORRY.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.875
