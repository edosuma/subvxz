I was just in the music store

You're incredible.

It's all right.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.260
How long have you been playing?

14:45.260 --> 14:46.780

14:46.780 --> 14:48.180
- You started playing today?

14:50.600 --> 14:53.940
That's funny, but where
do rehearse or practice?

14:53.940 --> 14:57.623
I don't wanna sound rude, but
you're homeless, aren't you?

14:58.790 --> 14:59.623
- Yeah.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.200
- I got an idea.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.120
I'm throwing a party
Friday night at my house.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.300
I already hired a pianist,

15:07.300 --> 15:09.000
but I'd much rather have you play.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.270
Hey, Will, there's gonna
be a lot of people there

15:12.270 --> 15:14.300
who'd love to hear you play.

15:14.300 --> 15:18.400
Will, I'm trying to offer you a job.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.540
- What?

15:19.540 --> 15:21.530
- I was gonna pay the other pianist $600

15:21.530 --> 15:22.363
to play for the night.

15:22.363 --> 15:23.910
- So you wanna pay me to play piano?

15:23.910 --> 15:25.557
- [Ken] Yes, yes.

15:25.557 --> 15:26.583
- $600?

15:27.580 --> 15:29.810
- Will, be at this address

15:31.380 --> 15:32.894

15:43.330 --> 15:44.540
- This is all I got really, this--

15:44.540 --> 15:47.010
- Here, come here, come here, come here.

15:47.010 --> 15:49.123
Listen, take this.

15:52.220 --> 15:55.900
Take this and get a shirt, some
shoes, and some pants, okay?

15:55.900 --> 15:57.610
It's fine, take it.

15:57.610 --> 15:59.320
- Thank you, thank you.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.080

17:31.400 --> 17:32.500

17:33.550 --> 17:34.727
- Just doing my thing, you know,

17:34.727 --> 17:37.810
and just, how's business been?

17:37.810 --> 17:38.850
- It's, it's good,

17:38.850 --> 17:40.750
it's been kinda crazy the
last couple of months,

17:40.750 --> 17:42.653
but finally making a little money.

17:45.326 --> 17:46.159
You all right, man?

17:46.159 --> 17:47.120
You don't look so good.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.023

17:49.370 --> 17:51.070
- Oh, I know what you need.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.963
- No, I um, I don't do that anymore.

17:56.270 --> 17:58.740
- Come on, it'll be just like old times.

17:58.740 --> 17:59.633

18:12.630 --> 18:14.473
See you around in another two years.

18:21.210 --> 18:23.173

Yeah.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.710
Good?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.480

be even better here

18:49.480 --> 18:50.780

18:50.780 --> 18:52.220
Will, you remember Luna?

18:52.220 --> 18:53.053
- He better.

18:54.540 --> 18:57.700
- All right, it looks like
we're in for a wild night.

- [Will] Wait, no, it's
not like that though.

31:12.457 --> 31:14.811
- Yeah, you need to go.
- Mommy?

31:14.811 --> 31:15.728
Who's that?

31:16.710 --> 31:18.130
- [Carrie] It's nobody, baby.

31:18.130 --> 31:19.780
Come on, let's get back into bed.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.190
Mommy, will be right back.

31:22.190 --> 31:23.990
I'm going outside for just a second.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.283
- That's not why I'm here, okay.

31:27.283 --> 31:28.903
- Then why are you here?

31:32.410 --> 31:34.040
Do you need me to take
you to the hospital?

31:34.040 --> 31:34.873
- No.

31:36.890 --> 31:40.503
- You don't have anybody, friends?

31:44.646 --> 31:45.479
Oh my God.

31:48.997 --> 31:53.060
All right, you can come in,

31:53.060 --> 31:54.430
but if you hurt my daughter,

31:54.430 --> 31:56.383
I swear to God, I will kill you.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.760
- She's my daughter too.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.290
- No, let's get one thing straight, okay,

32:02.290 --> 32:05.070
when you chose that life,
you gave up everything.

32:05.070 --> 32:06.570
Just because you helped make a baby

32:06.570 --> 32:08.670
does not make you a father.

32:08.670 --> 32:09.503
You got it?

32:11.960 --> 32:13.113
We don't need you.

32:19.268 --> 32:20.101
- I know.

32:25.120 --> 32:25.953
- Okay.

32:31.770 --> 32:33.203
Do you still drink tea?

32:36.433 --> 32:37.600
Here, come in.

32:45.112 --> 32:48.112
(slow gentle music)

32:56.420 --> 32:58.630
I almost didn't recognize
you with that beard.

32:58.630 --> 33:00.926
- Oh, it's still me.

33:00.926 --> 33:03.015
- [Carrie] There you go.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.015
- Thank you.

33:05.790 --> 33:08.293
- So what happened?

33:13.361 --> 33:14.561
You don't wanna tell me.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.953
- I don't want you to think I'm crazy.

33:20.560 --> 33:25.140
- So you had nowhere else
to go and you're here,

33:25.140 --> 33:27.413
and you're still not gonna
tell me what happened?

33:29.633 --> 33:31.183
Are you gonna tell me anything?

33:35.345 --> 33:36.762
- I, I gotta job.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.725
- You did?

33:40.725 --> 33:43.120
- It's just a one day thing.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.420
- What kind of work is it?

33:48.200 --> 33:49.203
- Playing the piano.

33:51.510 --> 33:53.513
- You don't play piano.

33:54.657 --> 33:55.490
- I know.

34:15.958 --> 34:19.208
(dramatic piano music)

35:08.850 --> 35:12.933
- Hey, I guess you do play piano.

35:14.258 --> 35:15.740
(door clatters)

35:15.740 --> 35:18.563
Oh, shoot, I'll be right back.

35:22.890 --> 35:24.940
Are you ever gonna tell me what happened?

35:28.020 --> 35:33.020
- Lightning, I was struck by lightning.

35:33.508 --> 35:34.341
- What?

35:34.341 --> 35:35.361
- [Annie] Mommy?

35:35.361 --> 35:37.444
- Oh, I'll be right back.

35:39.850 --> 35:42.824
Here baby, you gotta get back in bed.

35:42.824 --> 35:45.320
We gotta get up early for school tomorrow.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.183
Okay, let's get under the covers.

35:48.190 --> 35:49.290
'Kay, close your eyes.

35:52.196 --> 35:57.196
♪ You are my sunshine, my only sunshine ♪

35:57.226 --> 36:02.226
♪ You make me happy when skies are gray ♪

36:02.385 --> 36:04.481
♪ You'll never know, dear ♪

36:04.481 --> 36:06.080
(menacing music)

36:06.080 --> 36:06.913
- Hello?

36:09.060 --> 36:10.310
- [Carrie] Just a minute.

36:29.140 --> 36:30.250
What are you doing?

36:30.250 --> 36:33.258
- I, uh, I thought,

36:33.258 --> 36:35.850
I just need to use the bathroom is what--

36:35.850 --> 36:37.000
- Oh, it's right there.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.430
Um, look I would really
love to keep catching up,

36:43.430 --> 36:45.443
but I have work really early tomorrow.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.990
But you can stay on the couch tonight.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.223
But tomorrow you gotta go, okay.

36:53.270 --> 36:54.881
But let's get coffee

36:54.881 --> 36:56.900
and then you can tell me
more about what happened.

36:56.900 --> 36:57.810
- Yeah?

36:57.810 --> 36:58.643
- Yeah.

37:00.430 --> 37:03.080
It's really good to see
you're turning things around.

37:06.146 --> 37:07.313
So, goodnight.

37:10.116 --> 37:11.283
- Hey, Carrie,

37:17.055 --> 37:17.888
thank you.

37:19.242 --> 37:20.866
- Oh, goodnight.

37:20.866 --> 37:23.866
(slow gentle music)

37:51.642 --> 37:54.309
(ominous music)

38:01.132 --> 38:02.190
- Jeez!

38:02.190 --> 38:05.023
(startling music)

38:10.970 --> 38:13.887
(unsettling music)

38:35.042 --> 38:38.209
(menacing whispering)

39:07.503 --> 39:08.670
- [Ghost] Shh.

39:09.762 --> 39:11.308
- What are you doing?

39:11.308 --> 39:13.190
What do you think you're doing?

39:13.190 --> 39:15.620
- I was just, I was just checking on her.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.880
- Will, I am trusting you.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.423
Don't make me regret this.

39:21.790 --> 39:25.203
I know that you miss her,
but this is not okay.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.353
Good.

39:32.457 --> 39:33.374
Good night.

39:47.211 --> 39:49.794
(piano clangs)

39:54.971 --> 39:55.804
- Hi.

39:56.922 --> 39:58.253
- Leave him alone, Annie.

39:59.151 --> 40:00.660
Here you go.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.490
You gotta blow on it.

40:02.490 --> 40:03.740
Now go get your backpack.

40:06.547 --> 40:08.570
Well, I'm going to work,

40:08.570 --> 40:10.650
but you don't have to leave right now.

40:10.650 --> 40:13.999
But I'd kinda like it if you
weren't here when I got back.

40:13.999 --> 40:17.253
There's some coffee over
there if you want some.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.840
- Do you have a computer?

40:20.840 --> 40:23.050
- I do, but the screen on it is broken.

40:23.050 --> 40:25.250
I've been saving up for a new one.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.300
I usually just use my phone.

40:27.300 --> 40:32.300
But the library is, well, you know.

40:35.390 --> 40:37.893
Let's still get that coffee
sometime though, okay?

40:41.467 --> 40:44.550
(tender piano music)

40:46.297 --> 40:48.464
Okay, Annie, we better go.

40:51.224 --> 40:52.807
All right, um, bye.

41:32.149 --> 41:34.732
(uneasy music)

42:25.961 --> 42:29.943
- Hey, asshole, get the
hell away from my car.

42:30.860 --> 42:32.800
- Great, thank you very much,

42:32.800 --> 42:35.049
and Dr. Norman will see
you in about 10 minutes.

42:35.049 --> 42:35.882
- [Patient] Okay.

42:35.882 --> 42:36.715
- Okay.

42:40.119 --> 42:43.369
(delicate piano music)

43:02.860 --> 43:05.380
- Uh, hi, excuse me, can I help you?

43:05.380 --> 43:06.360
- No, that's okay.

43:07.870 --> 43:10.480
- Um, you're not allowed
to just hang out here.

43:10.480 --> 43:12.566
- No, I actually wanted
to get some books on music

43:12.566 --> 43:14.110
and then use the internet

43:14.110 --> 43:16.060
to do some research on computer repair.

43:32.507 --> 43:34.160
(knocking on door)

43:34.160 --> 43:34.993
- Come on in.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.060
- Dr. Norman?

43:38.060 --> 43:38.953
- One second.

43:43.640 --> 43:45.000
Hey, what's going on?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.670
- I don't mean to be bothering you,

43:46.670 --> 43:48.920
but I was just wondering
if you had a moment

43:48.920 --> 43:50.440
for a medical question?

43:50.440 --> 43:51.273
- [Doctor] Sure.

43:52.155 --> 43:54.910
- Do you have any experience with patients

43:54.910 --> 43:56.980
who've been struck by lightning?

43:56.980 --> 43:57.883
- By lightning?

43:58.830 --> 44:00.530
Wow, I gotta think about that one.

44:02.620 --> 44:04.330
Lightning, actually I did have a guy

44:04.330 --> 44:07.510
years ago in the emergency
room got hit by lightning,

44:07.510 --> 44:09.260
left an awful scar.

44:09.260 --> 44:11.280
I remember that very clearly.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.760
The scar, it's actually called
the Lichtenberg figures.

44:13.760 --> 44:14.970
It's very, very odd.

44:14.970 --> 44:16.320
Let me look that up for ya.

44:18.160 --> 44:21.050
Okay, I think I found it, here it is.

44:21.050 --> 44:22.580
Take a look at that.

44:22.580 --> 44:23.433
- Oh, wow.

44:28.490 --> 44:30.235
- So what's going on?

44:30.235 --> 44:34.010
- Oh, um, my friend, he
said that it happened to him

44:34.010 --> 44:37.260
and I was wondering if you
had any experience with it.

44:37.260 --> 44:39.960
- Well, they call Tampa the
lightning capital of the world,

44:39.960 --> 44:41.360
so we do hear about it.

44:41.360 --> 44:44.930
But you know, has the guy seen a doctor?

44:44.930 --> 44:46.060
- I don't think so, no.

44:46.060 --> 44:46.939
- Really?

44:46.939 --> 44:47.772
- [Carrie] Mm mmm.

44:47.772 --> 44:48.740
- He really should, yeah.

44:48.740 --> 44:51.330
I got a good friend of
mine who's a neurologist.

44:51.330 --> 44:52.624
He'd be perfect for that.

44:52.624 --> 44:53.457
- Oh, really?

44:53.457 --> 44:55.898
- Yeah, he's a great guy
and we refer patients

44:55.898 --> 44:57.860
back and forth for many, many years,

44:57.860 --> 44:59.470
so I'll write down his number.

44:59.470 --> 45:01.440
Let me look that up right now for you.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.770
And if he needs to get seen,

45:03.770 --> 45:05.790
definitely get him over there.

45:05.790 --> 45:06.623
- Yeah.

45:08.403 --> 45:09.236
- There you go.

45:09.236 --> 45:12.620
And take that, tell him
I referred you over.

45:12.620 --> 45:15.560
I mean, it could be a
pretty important thing

45:15.560 --> 45:16.440
for him to go get seen.

45:16.440 --> 45:17.820
- Yeah, I can imagine.

45:17.820 --> 45:19.564
- Yep, I hope everything works out.

45:19.564 --> 45:20.397
- [Carrie] Thank you.

45:20.397 --> 45:21.430
- Absolutely.

45:21.430 --> 45:22.263
- Yeah, thanks.

45:22.263 --> 45:24.113
- Sure, do I need to go over those charts?

45:25.121 --> 45:27.000
- Oh, yeah, these are for you.

45:27.000 --> 45:27.833
- All right.

45:27.833 --> 45:28.666
- Okay, thank you, Dr. Norman.

45:28.666 --> 45:30.240
- Thank you, oh, you're welcome.

45:32.209 --> 45:34.959
(gripping music)

46:19.868 --> 46:22.785

(speaking in foreign language)

46:42.118 --> 46:44.701
(tense music)

47:11.270 --> 47:12.263
- Are you okay?

47:13.360 --> 47:14.193
- Are you real?

47:15.500 --> 47:16.333
- Excuse me?

47:16.333 --> 47:17.323
- Are you real?

47:18.310 --> 47:20.269
- Is there somebody I can call for you

47:20.269 --> 47:22.133
or somewhere you can go?

47:23.810 --> 47:24.643
- I'm fine.

47:28.730 --> 47:30.693
- So how was school, babe?

47:33.490 --> 47:34.350
Annie?

47:34.350 --> 47:35.183
- What?

47:35.183 --> 47:36.520
- [Carrie] How was school.

47:36.520 --> 47:37.353
- Okay.

47:38.910 --> 47:40.100
- So I was thinkin',

47:40.100 --> 47:43.050
maybe we visit grandma
and grandpa tonight.

47:43.050 --> 47:44.770
- Is that okay with grandma?

47:44.770 --> 47:47.761
- Yeah, and guess what
they're having for dinner?

47:47.761 --> 47:48.713
- What?

said shouldn't be here.

50:04.500 --> 50:08.263

50:09.490 --> 50:10.323
- What?

50:10.323 --> 50:12.210
- Yeah, screen, it works now.

50:12.210 --> 50:13.300
- [Carrie] Are you serious?

50:13.300 --> 50:14.133
- Take a look.

50:17.660 --> 50:18.493
See?

50:18.493 --> 50:20.263
- Oh my God, how did you?

50:24.720 --> 50:25.683
Thank you.

50:36.860 --> 50:38.223
Do you wanna go to dinner?

50:41.300 --> 50:42.480
- You don't need to do that.

50:42.480 --> 50:44.088
Okay, I just, I wanted
to do something nice.

50:44.088 --> 50:47.273
- Well, no, I'm, I'm taking you to dinner.

50:50.199 --> 50:53.280
Plus, I really wanted to see you again

50:53.280 --> 50:55.943
'cause my dad, he let me have these.

51:04.580 --> 51:06.620
- Do you mind if I took a shower?

51:06.620 --> 51:07.453
- Of course.

51:26.852 --> 51:28.360
- Can I have the uh?

51:28.360 --> 51:30.413
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

51:32.740 --> 51:33.740
- Thank you.

51:36.140 --> 51:38.903
- Do you like that beard?

51:42.870 --> 51:43.703
- Not really.

51:46.487 --> 51:48.320
- Are you sure you wanna do this?

Stop the car.

53:44.839 --> 53:45.672
- Okay.

53:50.420 --> 53:53.504
- [Will] I gotta do something real quick.

53:53.504 --> 53:56.177
- My man, lookin' all clean.

53:56.177 --> 53:57.563
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

53:57.563 --> 53:59.150
- Good to see you.
- What's up?

53:59.150 --> 54:00.892
- [Will] Where's the money, huh?

54:00.892 --> 54:02.978
- [Tyler] What're you taking 'bout?

54:02.978 --> 54:03.811
- [Will] The $80.

54:03.811 --> 54:04.979
- [Tyler] What money, huh?

54:04.979 --> 54:06.381
- [Will] $80.

54:06.381 --> 54:08.010
- [Tyler] I don't have $80.

54:08.010 --> 54:08.843
- [Will] The money--

54:08.843 --> 54:10.267
- [Tyler] I don't have the money.

54:10.267 --> 54:11.100
- [Will] Give me the money.

54:11.100 --> 54:12.775
- [Tyler] Dude, get your
hands outta my pocket.

54:12.775 --> 54:13.790
Man, what is wrong with you?

54:13.790 --> 54:14.623
- [Will] Give me the fucking money.

54:14.623 --> 54:16.470

54:16.470 --> 54:18.573
Get off, Will, get off of me, dude.

54:19.584 --> 54:21.501
- [Will] Don't have it?

54:29.714 --> 54:31.090
- Are you okay?

54:31.090 --> 54:32.507
- Yeah, I'm okay.

54:33.500 --> 54:35.790
- Is that a friend of yours?

54:35.790 --> 54:36.623
- Not anymore.

54:39.330 --> 54:40.803
And dinner is on me.

54:48.740 --> 54:51.157
(both laugh)

54:53.050 --> 54:54.810
- Hey folks, how're we doing tonight?

54:54.810 --> 54:55.643
- Good.

54:56.550 --> 54:57.760
- Good, good, can I get you started off

54:57.760 --> 55:00.210
with something to drink,
maybe some wine perhaps?

55:02.000 --> 55:03.909
- I'm okay with water,
maybe you can have--

55:03.909 --> 55:06.873
- Uh, no, I'm good with water too, thanks.

55:06.873 --> 55:08.450
- Would you like a couple of
more minutes with the menu?

55:08.450 --> 55:10.150
Are we all set and ready to order?

55:12.890 --> 55:16.309
- Um, how 'bout you give us
just a couple more minutes.

55:16.309 --> 55:18.093

56:00.630 --> 56:01.463
- What?

56:03.320 --> 56:05.370
- I mean, you don't have to say anything.

56:07.854 --> 56:10.131
- Look, I wanted to be the man

56:10.131 --> 56:12.713
that you wanted me to
be, okay, I did, I just--

56:12.713 --> 56:15.133
- It's okay, it's okay.

56:16.020 --> 56:20.453
I'm fine, Annie's fine, we're happy.

56:28.879 --> 56:31.296
- Can you believe we're here?

56:32.550 --> 56:34.710
- Why, 'cause we used to come here?

56:34.710 --> 56:35.543
- No, no.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.973
Right here, right now,

56:41.490 --> 56:44.530
all the people that there
are in the world right,

56:44.530 --> 56:46.833
do you know how many people
there are in the world?

56:48.810 --> 56:51.330
- I don't know, a couple billion?

56:51.330 --> 56:54.300
- There are 7.5 billion
people in the world, okay?

56:54.300 --> 56:58.800
And we are right here,
we are right now, right?

56:58.800 --> 57:01.100
Amongst everybody in all the restaurants,

57:01.100 --> 57:02.320
we're in the same restaurant,

57:02.320 --> 57:04.020
we're in the same state, the same country,

57:04.020 --> 57:08.170
the same universe amongst
billions of stars, right?

57:08.170 --> 57:12.010
If you calculated the odds of the chances

57:12.010 --> 57:15.370
of us being in the same
place, the same time, I mean.

57:20.142 --> 57:23.503
- Kinda like the odds of
being struck by lightning?

57:28.150 --> 57:28.983
- Exactly.

57:34.000 --> 57:34.950
- You're different.

57:37.910 --> 57:39.053
- Is that a bad thing?

57:41.910 --> 57:45.103
- It's just different.

57:48.032 --> 57:48.865
- I guess we're always evolving

57:48.865 --> 57:53.467
at different various
degrees of celerity, right?

57:57.530 --> 57:58.433
- Who are you?

58:06.310 --> 58:08.030
What, what do you--

58:08.030 --> 58:10.333
- I'm sorry, do you, do you see that?

58:12.620 --> 58:13.563
- See what?

58:14.696 --> 58:18.383
- The woman in the parking lot?

58:22.200 --> 58:23.873
- I don't see a woman.

58:25.410 --> 58:28.343
What, Will, what's wrong?

58:31.630 --> 58:32.540
- Did you get a chance to look

58:32.540 --> 58:34.500
at our dessert menu by chance?

58:34.500 --> 58:37.030
- I'm sorry, we need, we need a minute.

58:37.030 --> 58:38.290
- Yeah, definitely.

58:38.290 --> 58:39.123
- Sorry.

58:43.978 --> 58:45.878
- Will, what's going on, what's wrong?

58:50.660 --> 58:53.030
- I keep seeing these, I don't know,

58:53.030 --> 58:54.490
I keep seeing these things.

58:54.490 --> 58:55.973
- Well, what things?

58:57.200 --> 58:59.060
- I don't know, I can't
tell if they're real.

58:59.060 --> 59:00.790
I can't tell if I'm going crazy.

59:00.790 --> 59:02.210
I didn't wanna tell you

59:02.210 --> 59:04.690
because I didn't want
you to think that I'm--

59:04.690 --> 59:09.335
- No, hey, hey, I still care about you.

59:09.335 --> 59:12.003
I mean, I know you're not crazy.

59:13.800 --> 59:17.320
I made an appointmnet at a
neurologist for tomorrow.

59:17.320 --> 59:19.810
And I thought that maybe he
could give us some answers.

59:19.810 --> 59:22.680
And it's no big deal,
it's a friend of my boss'.

59:22.680 --> 59:25.053
We don't even have to pay anything.

59:31.438 --> 59:32.271
What?

59:33.860 --> 59:36.520
- I'm sorry, behind you over there,

59:36.520 --> 59:38.360
do you see a, do you see a man sitting

59:38.360 --> 59:41.010
at the table by any chance?

59:41.010 --> 59:43.628
I mean, don't make a, wait, don't make it,

59:43.628 --> 59:45.453
try not to make it obvious though.

59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.323
- I do see him.

01:00:01.216 --> 01:00:03.393
But that doesn't mean that you're,

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:07.640
you wanna get outta here?

01:00:10.096 --> 01:00:11.263
- [Will] Yeah.

01:00:12.228 --> 01:00:13.937
- [Carrie] Come on.

01:00:13.937 --> 01:00:16.937
(slow gentle music)

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:44.848
(eerie music)

01:00:44.848 --> 01:00:45.848
- What Will?

01:00:47.223 --> 01:00:48.140
What is it?

01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:54.851
- [Will] Sorry, I, uh--

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:58.755
- No, no, no, no, don't, don't be sorry.

01:00:58.755 --> 01:00:59.588
It's okay.

01:01:02.307 --> 01:01:03.140
It's okay.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:47.617
(slow unsettling music)

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.633
(startling music)

01:02:15.313 --> 01:02:17.563
- What do you want from me?

01:02:19.948 --> 01:02:21.190
Answer me!

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:23.607
- Will, it's me, please stop!

01:02:24.795 --> 01:02:27.962
(slow reserved music)

01:02:30.573 --> 01:02:31.953
- I should, I should go.

01:02:33.155 --> 01:02:34.069
- No.

01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:35.250
- No, I shouldn't be here,
this isn't your problem.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.083
- Will, no.

01:02:39.627 --> 01:02:41.790
I should've been there for you.

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:42.863
- It's not your fault.

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:46.630
- I told you to leave

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.513
'cause I wanted you know
what you were losing, but,

01:02:52.253 --> 01:02:54.253
we should've worked through it together.

01:02:59.057 --> 01:03:00.103
- Carrie, it's--

01:03:00.103 --> 01:03:02.603
- I don't wanna do that again.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.747
7.5 billion people, right?

01:03:30.128 --> 01:03:31.295
- [Will] Yeah.

01:03:48.727 --> 01:03:49.560
- Will.

01:03:50.436 --> 01:03:51.436
- [Will] Mm.

01:03:53.323 --> 01:03:54.823
- What time is it?

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:12.553
- Between 9:30 and 9:35.

01:04:13.667 --> 01:04:18.410
- How do you know that?

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:19.960
- Use the placement of the sun.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.603
- Okay, smart guy.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.399
We gotta get you to your appointmnet.

01:04:28.399 --> 01:04:29.481
- [Will] Mm mmm.

01:04:29.481 --> 01:04:30.981
- [Carrie] Mm hmm.

01:04:35.357 --> 01:04:38.383
- Do you have a cell phone I could use?

01:04:39.735 --> 01:04:44.334
- Yeah, let's see.

01:04:44.334 --> 01:04:45.666
Here, you get that.

01:04:45.666 --> 01:04:46.666
- Thank you.

01:04:47.607 --> 01:04:49.630
- Who you callin'?

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.410
- Hi, Mr. Donovan, it's Will.

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:52.243
How are you?

01:04:52.243 --> 01:04:53.076
From the music store.

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.220
Yes, sir, I am definitely
still coming tonight.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.720
Is it the address on the card?

01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:03.720
You have a pen?

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.553
A pen I could?

01:05:04.553 --> 01:05:06.220
- [Carrie] Oh, yeah.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.470
- Yeah, let me go ahead and
repeat that back to you.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:16.100
It's over the Tom Stuart Causeway,

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.350
left on Bayshore,

01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:19.980
then an immediate right
on North Redington,

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.050
it's gonna be the third house on the left,

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:23.433
gate code is #346715.

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:27.710
I'm good, it's okay, I got it.

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.270
One more quick question, Mr. Donovan,

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:31.973
is it okay if, um, my,

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.503
my girlfriend comes?

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:42.663
No, sir, she lives in a house, yes.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.333
Yes, sir.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.443
I can do that.

01:05:53.639 --> 01:05:55.333
I'll see you tonight, bye.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.450
You wanna go to a party tonight?

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.353
- Yeah.

01:06:08.353 --> 01:06:09.318
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:06:09.318 --> 01:06:11.735
(both laugh)

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:15.436
(knocking on door)

01:06:15.436 --> 01:06:16.269
- Come in.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.350
Hi.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.350
- Hi, we have an 11 o'clock appointmnet.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.940

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:24.773
- I'm Carrie.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:25.997
- Oh, sorry (chuckles).

01:06:25.997 --> 01:06:27.340
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.810
Must make you Will.

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:29.710
- Yes, sir.

01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:31.170
- Oh, please call me Noah.

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:32.003
Come on in guys, have a seat.

01:06:32.003 --> 01:06:33.134
- Okay, thanks.

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:46.407
- So struck by lightning, hm.

01:06:47.823 --> 01:06:48.673
When'd it happen?

01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:52.520
- Three days ago.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.270
- Did you go to a hospital?

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:57.260
- No, sir, did nothing,
I didn't go to a doctor.

01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.160
- So I'm the first doctor you've seen?

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:05.588
All right, so what are
we dealing with here?

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.543
How've you been feeling since it happened?

01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:11.820
- I have these bad headaches.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.923
Um, seeing things that's not there.

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:17.450
- Seeing things?

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.880
What kinds of things?

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:20.943
- Mostly people.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:25.693
- Really, what kind of people?

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.503
- And tell him about the other stuff.

01:07:32.741 --> 01:07:35.693
- I can do things that I
wasn't able to do before.

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:38.630
- What does that mean?

01:07:40.133 --> 01:07:42.330
- Like he can play piano,

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:44.480
he can fix laptops,

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.080
he can look out the window
and tell what time it is.

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:51.593
- And you couldn't do any
of those things before?

01:07:52.754 --> 01:07:54.087
- [Will] Mm mmm.

01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.013
- Hmm.

01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:58.900
Carrie, would mind giving Will

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.050
and I just a couple of minutes?

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:01.710
I wanna run him through
some cognition tests.

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.815
And I just wanna make
sure he's not distracted.

01:08:03.815 --> 01:08:08.192
- Oh, yeah, yeah, are you okay?

01:08:08.192 --> 01:08:09.025
- Yeah.

01:08:09.025 --> 01:08:09.858
- Okay.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.593
- Thanks.

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.050
All right, Will, I'd like to start out

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:19.790
by checking your eidetic memory, okay?

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:21.600
So what I'm gonna have you do is look

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.990
at this card for five seconds.

01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:25.676
It's got all the digits of pi on it.

01:08:25.676 --> 01:08:28.162
I'd like you to memorize
as many as you can.

01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:29.962
You ready?

01:08:29.962 --> 01:08:31.481
- 3.14159

01:08:31.481 --> 01:08:32.314
2653589793

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.133
23846264

01:08:38.536 --> 01:08:39.410
338327950

01:08:41.554 --> 01:08:43.943
28841971.

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:47.582
- How, how'd you do that?

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:51.183
- I saw the card when
you were sittin' down.

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:55.173
I, uh, I passed, I guess?

01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:01.520
- Uh, well, it's not really
a pass or fail kind of test.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.983
Most people can memorize
about seven digits.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:07.153
Hey,

01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:10.870
you ever see one of these?

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:12.563
- Yeah.

01:09:12.563 --> 01:09:13.540
- Do you know what it is?

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.840
- Yeah, it's a Rubik's Cube.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.859
- You know how it works?

01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:18.693
- Um, I think so.

01:09:18.693 --> 01:09:20.930
You're supposed to make
every side a different color.

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:23.082
- Right, wanna give it a shot?

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.654
- Not particularly.

01:09:25.654 --> 01:09:26.487
- Come on.

01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:29.620
Mind if I time you?

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:31.502
- For what?

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:34.380
- [Noah] And.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.750
- Aren't these supposed to be--

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:36.582
- [Noah] Go!

01:10:03.019 --> 01:10:05.503
That's amazing.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.213
What's wrong?

01:10:11.796 --> 01:10:14.629
(startling music)

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:16.833
What is it?

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:20.663
Are you okay?

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.400
Hey, it's okay.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.827
- I'm sorry, I.

01:10:28.827 --> 01:10:30.220
Can we go?

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.432
- [Carrie] Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:10:32.432 --> 01:10:33.510
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:35.520
can I talk to you for a second?

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.870
- Yeah.

01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:38.120
- Look, I need to be honest,

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.863
I've never seen anything like this before.

01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:42.740
And I just think that the more

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.970
we understand what's going on,

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:47.180
the better help we can be for him.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.333
So how soon can you bring him back?

01:10:50.484 --> 01:10:52.760
- Oh, well, maybe tomorrow,

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.190
but it's really up to him.

01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:57.620
- I get that, but you need to understand

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.820
that we need to start thinking

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.883
about what's best for him, okay?

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.393
I'm just sayin'.

01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:07.413
- Yeah, well, I'll talk to him.

01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:14.283
Will!

01:11:14.283 --> 01:11:15.116
- What?

01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:17.960
- What is wrong, what happened in there?

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.120
- I'm messed up, all right?

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.930
That's what happened.

01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:21.980
- You're not messed up.

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:23.640
- This isn't how things
were supposed to go.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.383
It was supposed to be different, my.

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.353
- [Carrie] Will, you're not messed up.

01:11:28.353 --> 01:11:29.390
- Yes, I am, okay.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:31.271
- No, you're not.

01:11:31.271 --> 01:11:33.300
We're gonna fix it, okay.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.410
We're gonna fix all of it.

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:35.900
I mean, that's why we're here.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.500
- I think it'd be better if you,

01:11:38.783 --> 01:11:40.924
if you just stayed away
from me, all right?

01:11:40.924 --> 01:11:44.174
(slow reserved music)

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:49.353
- Do you remember our first date?

01:11:49.353 --> 01:11:52.000
- What are you bringing
up our first date for?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.453
- Everything went wrong,
like everything went wrong.

01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:00.043
Good things came from that.

01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:03.996
I mean, it's the same with this.

01:12:03.996 --> 01:12:06.746
And I'm gonna be here with
you through the whole thing.

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:11.453
Also, kinda wanna do something fun.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.273
And I think you could use it.

01:12:23.838 --> 01:12:25.161
(slow tender music)

01:12:25.161 --> 01:12:27.744
(Annie laughs)

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.187
- [Annie] Tag.

01:12:46.134 --> 01:12:46.967
- Oh, boy.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.733
You ready for, uh, I got an idea.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.213
You ready?

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.443
What do you think if we
team up and get Mommy?

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:00.554
- I'm not playin'.

01:13:00.554 --> 01:13:02.034
- [Will] Oh, yes you are.

01:13:02.034 --> 01:13:02.881
Let's get her.

01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:06.298
(Annie and Carrie laugh)

01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:12.416
I need to save you.

01:13:16.167 --> 01:13:17.000
One, two.

01:13:17.966 --> 01:13:21.200
(Carrie screams)

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.153
- You got me.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.033
You tired?

01:13:25.272 --> 01:13:26.105
- [Will] I'm tired.

01:13:26.105 --> 01:13:28.120
- [Carrie] It's getting kinda late.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:30.840
We're gonna stay at grandma
and grandpa's tonight, okay?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.673
- [Annie] Okay.

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:32.860
- [Carrie] We got a big
party that we're gonna go to.

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:33.963
- [Annie] But I wanna stay with you.

01:13:34.917 --> 01:13:35.750
- [I know, baby.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:38.990
I'd bring you with me if I could.

01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:41.590
But I'm gonna come get you
first thing tomorrow, okay?

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:43.503
- Can we come back tomorrow?

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.473
- Can we?

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:49.905
- Yeah.

01:13:49.905 --> 01:13:51.822
- Thank you, thank you.

01:13:52.831 --> 01:13:54.581
Thank you, thank you.

01:14:01.598 --> 01:14:02.750
(delicate piano music)

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:04.113
- I'm almost ready.

01:14:14.224 --> 01:14:15.724
Does it look okay?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:22.850
- You're perfect.

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:28.097
- I got my clutch,

01:14:31.285 --> 01:14:32.690
my keys.

01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:33.523
- Hey.

01:14:43.286 --> 01:14:45.933
I'm not gonna mess up again.

01:14:45.933 --> 01:14:46.766
- I know.

01:14:59.482 --> 01:15:00.482
We gotta go.

01:15:02.071 --> 01:15:03.321
- Yeah.
- Ready?

01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:05.503
You okay?

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.273
- Yeah.

01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:15.353
(knocking on door)

01:15:15.353 --> 01:15:16.553
- Hello, can I help you?

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:20.250
- Hi, I'm Will, this is Carrie.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:22.990
We're here for the party.

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:24.640
- Sorry, this is a private party.

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.253
- Okay.

01:15:29.253 --> 01:15:30.923
- Did you wanna call him?

01:15:35.066 --> 01:15:36.733
- Will, you made it.

01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:40.370
Look at you, I wouldn't
have recognized you.

01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:45.167
And who is this?

01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:47.460
- Hi, I'm Carrie.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.173
- Hello, Carrie, I'm Ken Donovan.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.213
Welcome.

01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:55.720
- You have a lovely home.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.350
- Thank you very much.

01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:58.730
Would you like to see the inside of it,

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:01.673
or are you more comfortable outside?

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:05.540
I'm just kidding Will, it was a joke.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.510
Come on in, welcome, welcome.

01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:08.560
- [Carrie] Thank you.

01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:43.683
- Ladies and gentlemen,

01:16:43.683 --> 01:16:45.113
can I have your attention for a moment?

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.550
First of all, thank you for coming

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:51.100
and I hope you're enjoying yourselves

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.050
because tonight we have

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:54.443
a very, very special treat for everyone.

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.720
I met this man earlier in the week.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.740
He was without a job,
living on the streets,

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.083
and abusing drugs.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.810
But now, he's gonna
show you what's possible

01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:09.910
when someone reaches their full potential.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.273
You see, he has a gift,

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.943
and he's gonna share that
gift with us this evening.

01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:21.080
So without any further adieu,

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.530
please enjoy the musical stylings

01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:25.563
of piano prodigy, Will.

01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:30.800
(guests applaud)

01:17:53.256 --> 01:17:56.173
(piano keys clang)

01:18:11.449 --> 01:18:15.532
("Toccata" by Sergey Prokofiev)

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:31.860
- Excuse me, sir, Mr. Donovan
would like to see you.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:32.703
- Well, sure.

01:19:34.966 --> 01:19:35.799
Are you okay?

01:19:35.799 --> 01:19:37.433
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm okay.

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.390
- I'll be right back.

01:19:57.150 --> 01:19:57.983
- Will,

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.420
I'm so glad you're here.

01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:09.753
Probably wondering why I asked you here.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.170
I just wanted to make sure you get paid

01:20:15.170 --> 01:20:20.120
for that amazing performance,
truly a masterful performance.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:20.953
- Thank you.

01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:25.600
- But you've gotta be
honest with me, Will,

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.150
how long have you been playing?

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.093
- Not long at all.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:35.993
- Really?

01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.903
- [Will] Yeah.

01:20:39.607 --> 01:20:44.607
- (chuckles) Okay, let's
go ahead and get you paid.

01:20:45.165 --> 01:20:47.665
(tense music)

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:05.660
- Um, excuse me, my boyfriend,

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.294
he's the guy who's the piano,

01:21:07.294 --> 01:21:09.480
someone took him to go see Mr. Donovan,

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.290
and we really have to get going.

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:14.260
Is there any way you could get him for me?

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.093
- Let me see what I can do.

01:21:15.093 --> 01:21:16.213
- Okay, thank you.

01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:24.850
- What the hell are you doing?

01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:27.253
- Relax, Will, this
will only take a second.

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.290
- You can't just do this to me, okay.

01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:30.373
Help, help!

01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:35.410
- Calm down, Will, I need you
to calm down and cooperate.

01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:37.200
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.200
- Look, just, just let me go.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.033
- Hold is arm.

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:46.490
- Stop, stop, stop, just
listen to me, listen.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.650
- All right, ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:55.600
unfortunately, the party
is over for tonight.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.509
Mr. Donovan would like to
thank you all for coming out

01:21:57.509 --> 01:22:00.053
And have a good night, get home safe.

01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:08.280
- I'm just gonna go get my boyfriend

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.720
so that we can go.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.510
- You're not allowed back there.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.050
- I'm just gonna go and get my boyfriend

01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:13.883
so that we can go.

01:22:13.883 --> 01:22:14.950
- I can't let you do that.

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.720
- Look, why are you doing this?

01:22:25.739 --> 01:22:28.120
- You know, Will, I'm disappointed in you.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.810
I would've thought now you
would've learned to use the gift.

01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:33.370
- What gift?

01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:34.470
- The gift I gave you.

01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:37.120
- You did this to me?

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.463
No, I was struck by lightning, okay.

01:22:40.321 --> 01:22:42.453
- (laughs) Can you
really believe everything

01:22:42.453 --> 01:22:44.123
that happened that night?

01:22:47.809 --> 01:22:49.130
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:51.453
- Oh, come on Will, don't embarrass me.

01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:55.840
I hand selected you from
several other candidates

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.223
for a human drug trial.

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.290
- Human trial for what?

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.450
- Celtrite, the drug that'll take us

01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:09.700
to the next step of evolution.

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.710
The ability to double and triple

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:13.453
the brain's capacity to learn.

01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:18.613
And you are living proof it works.

01:23:19.608 --> 01:23:21.930
- You see, it doesn't work, okay?

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.612
I'm having headaches, I'm seeing these,

01:23:24.612 --> 01:23:26.230
I see these things, I'm changing, okay.

01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:28.280
It doesn't work.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:31.570
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know
about the side effects

01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:33.770
and all that, Will, and
I'm working on that.

01:23:35.188 --> 01:23:36.620
But now I've got a sample of your blood

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.563
so I can continue my research.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.383
Will, come on, you should be thanking me.

01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:49.320
Do you realize how much
people are gonna pay

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.603
to have what you have?

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.710
(knocking on door)

01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:55.543
- [Roger] Sir?

01:23:55.543 --> 01:23:57.200
- I'm busy.

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.790
- Sir, the girl he came
with is causing a scene.

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:02.310
I think you need to come speak to her.

01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:04.402
- What am I paying you for?

01:24:04.402 --> 01:24:06.902
(tense music)

01:24:21.457 --> 01:24:22.957
Come on, let's go.

01:24:57.123 --> 01:24:58.623
- You're not real.

01:25:11.891 --> 01:25:14.641
(dramatic music)

01:25:29.155 --> 01:25:31.572
(gun clicks)

01:25:53.222 --> 01:25:55.722
(case clicks)

01:26:04.877 --> 01:26:06.653
- Get your hands off me!

01:26:07.723 --> 01:26:08.556
- [Carrie] Let go!

01:26:08.556 --> 01:26:10.463
- Excuse me, excuse me.

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:12.566
Is everything okay?

01:26:12.566 --> 01:26:15.010
- No, this guy won't let me through.

01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:16.350
- He's just doing his job.

01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:18.230
There are certain areas of the house

01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:20.150
which are off limits to the guests.

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:21.730
- Where's Will?

01:26:21.730 --> 01:26:23.950
- Will wasn't feeling well,
so he has to lay down.

01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:25.570
- Well, he was fine a second ago.

01:26:25.570 --> 01:26:26.660
Where is he?

01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:28.289
- He said he was getting migraines.

01:26:28.289 --> 01:26:30.880
Actually, he says it happens quite often,

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.360
which is understandable for an addict.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.750
- He's not an addict.

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:35.640
Where is he?

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:36.927
I wanna see him.

01:26:36.927 --> 01:26:38.283
- Oh, I don't think so.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.680
But I can assure you,
we'll get him home safely.

01:26:43.770 --> 01:26:45.180
Roger, show her to the door.

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:46.013
- Absolutely.

01:26:46.013 --> 01:26:47.830
- No, wait, Will!

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:48.985
- Get your hands off of her.

01:26:48.985 --> 01:26:49.818
(tense music)

01:26:49.818 --> 01:26:53.753
- Will, this is just a
big misunderstanding.

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:56.690
Now drop the gun and
let's talk about this.

01:26:56.690 --> 01:26:58.930
- We're not gonna talk, okay?

01:26:58.930 --> 01:26:59.830
We're gonna leave.

01:27:01.192 --> 01:27:02.025
You let her go.

01:27:09.845 --> 01:27:11.020
(gun fires)

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:11.853
Carrie!

01:27:13.874 --> 01:27:14.707
No!

01:27:17.597 --> 01:27:19.930
(gun fires)

01:27:22.462 --> 01:27:25.270
- (grunts) Anybody got
anything to say, huh?

01:27:29.521 --> 01:27:30.354
Good.

01:27:33.337 --> 01:27:36.923
Now clean this up, I'm going to bed.

01:27:51.796 --> 01:27:53.160
(gentle guitar music)

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.300
- [Announcer Of Ad] Are you feeling tired,

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:59.630
depressed, alone, or helpless?

01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:04.103
Are your day-to-day tasks
feeling overwhelming at times?

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:10.733
What if there was a way to change?

01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:15.893
A way to take back your life,

01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:18.990
the job you wanted,

01:28:18.990 --> 01:28:21.353
the time you've been missing,

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:25.983
the success that always
seemed out of reach,

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:31.053
what if you could change all
of it with a simple choice?

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:35.223
Celtrite is that choice.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.470
Using state of the art technology,

01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:43.390
Celtrite delivers the power
to expand the functionality

01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:44.583
of the human mind.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:50.400
Consult your doctor to ask
if Celtrite is right for you.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.693
Celtrite may not be right for people

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:54.180
with dementia or thyroid issues.

01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:57.530
Side effects include nausea, irritability,

01:28:57.530 --> 01:29:00.050
irregular breathing, erratic behavior,

01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:02.870
bad dreams, suicidal
thoughts or tendencies,

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:04.930
and in some cases, death.

01:29:04.930 --> 01:29:06.810
If any if these symptoms occur,

01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:10.383
stop taking Celtrite immediately,
and consult your doctor.

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:19.770
The beginning of your life can start today

01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:21.033
because with Celtrite,

01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:24.787
the future is now.

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:31.413
(gentle music)
