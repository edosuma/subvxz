Megabyte.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.566
It's taking too long.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.538
What should I call you?

00:37.621 --> 00:41.083
Something that suits your unique
code-corrupting skill set.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.460
Chaos?

00:43.543 --> 00:45.337
Mayhem?

00:45.420 --> 00:47.339
Nuisance?

00:47.673 --> 00:49.132
Speaking of which.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.968
<i>Well, well.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:54.096
<i>You seem to have set yourself
up quite nicely, Megabyte.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:55.430
Yes, quite.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.475
My sentinel army is at your disposal.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.434
<i>Good.</i>

00:59.518 --> 01:00.644
We have a big day.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.563
A full agenda.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.440
Lots to do.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.692
Are you ready?

01:06.775 --> 01:09.361
You requested a distraction.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.780
I have a perfect one.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.491
<i>A cat virus, that's it?</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:16.952
It will be very effective, I assure you.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.161
<i>All right.</i>

01:18.328 --> 01:23.292
<i>It'll have to do. Now, get to it
and don't fail me, Megabyte.</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:27.379
Release the cat virus into a data stream.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.018
Captain of the basketball team
on the verge of failing

01:41.101 --> 01:44.521
a course a month into the
semester is unacceptable, Trey.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.689
I know.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.192
I'm sorry, Dad, but this course?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.902
It... I mean, principles of coding.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.422
I've never even written code before.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.781
It's a course like any other.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.575
You pay attention. You study.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.659
You get good grades.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.703
It's like a foreign language, Dad. I...

01:59.786 --> 02:02.289
Don't make excuses, Trey.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.875
Now, Coach Gorley says
you need a B average to stay on the team

02:04.958 --> 02:06.519
so I hope that you
are taking this seriously.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.753
I am.

02:07.878 --> 02:08.919
Okay? I swear.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.006
But it's not just school and basketball.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.090
No?

02:12.174 --> 02:14.051
Well, what else is there?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.052
Hmm?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.720
What, playing video games?

02:19.264 --> 02:20.307
No.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.061
Now, you have a test in this
coding course today,

02:24.144 --> 02:25.729
is that correct?

02:29.358 --> 02:31.526
Yes, second period.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.130
Well, there's no time like the present

02:33.195 --> 02:36.198
for you to start turning
this thing around.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.824
I know.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.370
I'll ace the test and I'll
get my average up.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.996
I promise.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.833
Now that's the kind of
commitment I like to hear.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.982
<i>Hey Moji is probably the best
new group I've heard all year,</i>

03:11.066 --> 03:12.609
<i>and after the next track drops</i>

03:12.692 --> 03:16.071
<i>I predict they're going to explode.</i>

03:16.947 --> 03:18.907
<i>It'll be available for download next week</i>

03:18.990 --> 03:22.953
<i>but I have an exclusive sneak
preview here on Tamra Says.</i>

03:23.036 --> 03:25.455
<i>So sit back and take a listen.</i>

03:37.426 --> 03:38.427
What the...

03:38.510 --> 03:40.971
Aw, how cute.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.140
Look at its little face.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.686
More like how annoying.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.235
Hey. What's up?

03:55.318 --> 03:56.862
Either Hey Moji has
a new lead singer

03:56.945 --> 04:00.449
or Tamra Says just got hacked
with a cat video pop-up.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.492
She's not the only one.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.453
Check it out.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.483
Enough, enough, enough!

04:36.026 --> 04:37.903
I have determined that it is a virus.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.404
You will need to trap it.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.906
So we're cat catchers, now?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.115
Yes.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.493
If you don't stop this cutie pie
from spreading

04:44.576 --> 04:46.745
it could clog up
the entire internet.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.998
I'm telling you, cats are just trouble.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.541
Trouble?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.835
This cat looks totally scrumptious.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.963
Wait, do I actually want
to eat a cat?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.675
No, I definitely do not.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.595
I would like to cuddle it.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.597
So how do we catch it?

05:05.680 --> 05:08.183
I will code an appropriate
containment carrier.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.686
Once you've captured the cat
virus, take it to Virusylum.

05:11.770 --> 05:12.938
Virus what?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.398
Virusylum. An impenetrable cyber prison

05:15.482 --> 05:18.985
where the Department of Internet
Security keeps captured viruses.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.696
DIS has a jail for viruses?

05:21.780 --> 05:23.198
Sweet.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.991
Okay, okay. Let's do this.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.911
Is there, uh, some sort of cyber
cat nip we can use

05:27.994 --> 05:29.162
to speed things along?

05:29.246 --> 05:30.413
Not that I'm aware of.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.374
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.917
It doesn't hurt to think ahead.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.377
Yeah, but you always overthink.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.962
It's just a cat virus, right?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.338
It's a guardian mission.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.798
We need a game plan.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.466
We can't afford to waste time.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.425
And we won't.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.719
Unless you wanna keep talking about it.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.179
Fine.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.764
Let's just do this.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.287
Why don't you try holding
your breath and counting to ten?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.289
Or is that the cure for the hiccups?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.583
You know, everything's just
a big joke to you, isn't it?

06:14.666 --> 06:15.500
Hey, boys.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.751
Play nice.

06:16.835 --> 06:17.669
Whatever.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.421
I don't have time for this.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.839
What a grouch.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.638
<i>The cat virus has been tracked
to this data stream hub.</i>

06:28.722 --> 06:31.391
<i>You must prevent it from
entering a main data stream</i>

06:31.474 --> 06:32.934
<i>and spreading more.</i>

06:39.774 --> 06:41.026
There it is.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.861
And there it goes!

06:42.986 --> 06:43.903
I'll get it.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.631
Hold up, Vector.
I have the carrier.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.574
So move! You're so slow.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.968
You can't just run at it.

06:48.992 --> 06:49.993
You'll spook it.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.494
We should sneak up
from behind it.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.412
Corner it.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.015
You want us to
tip toe around?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.680
Who said anything
about tip toe?

06:55.749 --> 06:56.666
I said sneak.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.586
Guys, there it goes again.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.963
Hurry!
It's infecting anything it touches.

07:02.047 --> 07:02.881
Where'd it go?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.841
Man, it's shifty.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.012
Uh-oh, it's headed straight
for our data stream.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.096
Zip board.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.770
Woah!

07:16.853 --> 07:18.980
Come on, guys.
We'll track them from the codec.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.524
This is so rad!

07:21.608 --> 07:22.692
You guys are missing out.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.196
Vector, just catch that cat
virus before it corrupts

07:26.279 --> 07:27.697
all the data in the stream.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.865
Too late.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.042
Phase one is in motion.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.127
The distraction is happening.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.181
Do your part, Megabyte.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.724
And I'm in.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.812
Sentinels, invade and infect!

08:21.584 --> 08:25.338
Okay. Trackers show that the cat
virus should be here somewhere.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.756
No sign of Vector.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.960
Yeah, big surprise.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.093
He's probably still surfing
that data stream.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.761
There it is, over there.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.265
Sneak around behind it.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.808
We'll corner it.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.477
Go slow.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.356
Hello, kitty.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.234
Woo!

08:46.317 --> 08:47.318
Coming through!

08:50.697 --> 08:51.614
I gotcha!

08:51.698 --> 08:52.866
Nice grab.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.368
Technically I should get
an assist.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.369
An assist?

08:56.453 --> 08:58.246
You almost blew it again.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.041
I'm lucky my shields held up,
otherwise I would have been infected.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.209
Oh, come on, grumpy cat.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.127
Chill.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.504
Let's just get to the virusylum
and finish the mission.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.552
It's even more delicious up close.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.512
Just analyze it, Vera.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.474
Fine.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.479
It doesn't appear to be overly complex.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.107
Once I have its composition

09:26.191 --> 09:27.942
I can stop the adorable cat videos

09:28.026 --> 09:29.778
from popping up everywhere.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.531
Oh.

09:33.615 --> 09:37.952
The cat virus contains traces
of another familiar virus.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.621
Megabyte.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.372
Cats and Megabyte.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.458
Two things I can't stand.

09:44.417 --> 09:49.005
Sentinels, prepare to
bring down the first firewall.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.381
Fire!

10:07.482 --> 10:09.400
The building security
has been compromised.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.944
The Nova X3J.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.155
Beautiful.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.033
Exquisite.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.085
Viral attack detected.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.631
Megabyte is invading Pogo
Computer Systems security hub.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.300
Get us there, Vera.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.135
Setting coordinates now.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.721
Maybe we should just let Pogo's
security deal with Megabyte.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.515
We go drop the cat off at Virusylum
and we can get back to school.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.518
You wanna go to school
instead of fighting Megabyte?

11:25.602 --> 11:26.978
Spill it, D-Frag.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.147
You've been acting weird all morning.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.611
I have a coding test. Second period.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.113
And my dad is freaking out about it.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.658
If I don't pass the test I'm
kicked off the basketball team.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.285
Why didn't you tell us this before?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.329
Because it's not your problem.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.622
It is now.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.749
We're also a team.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.709
And if we're quick we can
stop Megabyte

11:49.792 --> 11:52.754
and get to Virusylum before
second period starts.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.922
Okay?

11:54.005 --> 11:55.173
Okay, let's do it.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.091
Since speed is essential

11:57.175 --> 11:59.093
I have something that should help.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.054
A time space accelerator?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.555
No.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.474
I will activate individual vehicles

12:04.557 --> 12:07.185
for you, Enigma, and D-Frag.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.228
Not what I was thinking
but way cooler.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.312
Absolutely!

12:10.355 --> 12:12.023
I'm totally down with an upgrade.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.484
Yeah. As long as
it gets this done faster.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.041
Zip board!

12:32.001 --> 12:34.796
<i>Googz, your quadra disc is ready.</i>

12:34.879 --> 12:36.673
Quadra disc!

12:36.756 --> 12:39.801
Woo-hoo! Sweet! Woah...

12:39.884 --> 12:42.512
<i>Enigma, all systems go
for your stealth glider.</i>

12:42.595 --> 12:43.680
Stealth glider!

12:47.058 --> 12:48.309
Woo-hoo!

12:48.393 --> 12:49.936
I like this!

12:50.019 --> 12:51.062
A lot!

12:51.145 --> 12:52.230
<i>Your turn, D-Frag.</i>

12:52.313 --> 12:55.316
I am providing you with
state-of-the-art turbo jets.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.693
Turbo jets?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.528
I'm not so sure about this, Vera.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.364
Woah...

13:01.447 --> 13:03.032
Don't worry.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.534
They are equipped with stabilizers

13:04.617 --> 13:07.537
for maximum motion sickness prevention.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.871
Okay.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.581
Yeah, now you're talking.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.333
Woo!

13:16.421 --> 13:19.215
All right, guys.
Let's kick some virus butt!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.218
Frag fists!

13:23.928 --> 13:25.138
Coming through.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.597
Hiya!

13:31.227 --> 13:32.645
My turn!

13:35.231 --> 13:36.399
Whew!

13:36.482 --> 13:38.234
Code disruptor!

13:43.239 --> 13:44.699
These stabilizers are awesome.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.617
I don't feel sick at all.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.535
Woah.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.494
Uh-oh.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.954
Look out, D-Frag.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.456
Thanks!

13:51.539 --> 13:54.876
So my little feline distraction
didn't keep the guardians

13:54.959 --> 13:58.171
occupied as long as I anticipated.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.506
But they are too late.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.142
Bad news.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.311
Megabyte just smoked
the second firewall.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.915
The security system
has been disarmed.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.691
The entire building is vulnerable.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.335
<i>Report to my office, both of you.</i>

14:36.584 --> 14:39.087
You're mine now.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.774
Googz, Pogo needs some new firewalls.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.735
Enigma, you cover him.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.320
D-Frag, you and I will take Megabyte.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.780
Sounds like a plan.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.244
I'm taking you down, Megajerk!

15:11.327 --> 15:13.037
Such confidence.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.123
I will enjoy crushing it.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.209
Bash tagger.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.879
We'll be doing the crushing, Megatoggle.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.717
Firewall!

15:27.468 --> 15:29.178
- That's one.
- Googz! Get down!

15:30.972 --> 15:31.973
Thanks!

15:32.056 --> 15:34.892
Alpha sentinels, alert the troops.

15:34.976 --> 15:37.186
Return to the fortress at once.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.980
Running away, Megachicken?

15:40.148 --> 15:40.982
Hardly.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.568
I've accomplished what
I set out to do here.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.069
Woah!

15:45.153 --> 15:47.613
Until we meet again, guardians!

15:50.074 --> 15:51.552
I wonder what Megabyte meant
about accomplishing

15:51.576 --> 15:53.077
what he set out to do.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.247
Yeah, those firewalls weren't
down for very long.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.248
Who knows?

15:57.331 --> 15:58.833
That dude's pretty warped.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.253
Let's just get back in the codec
and deliver the cat virus.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.755
Hey, wait for me!

16:06.090 --> 16:07.341
Let's go, kitty.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.676
I'm on a tight schedule.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.221
Ugh.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.431
Yuck.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.141
A digital fur ball.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.186
No, not a fur ball.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.353
Then what is it?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.317
No idea.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.736
Hey Vera, can you figure out
what this is?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.822
Analysis of curious spherical
object initiated.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.171
And while you're doing that,
the four of us

16:33.201 --> 16:34.660
will take the cat to Virusylum.

16:34.744 --> 16:35.661
Change of plans.

16:35.745 --> 16:36.996
Just three of us.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.956
D-Frag's headed back to Room Zero.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.333
What're you talking about?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.126
You're on a tight schedule,
remember?

16:42.210 --> 16:43.794
Second period's about to start.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.129
We can handle the drop-off.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.964
You've got a coding test to pass.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.050
Okay, thanks.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.053
Remember to end your statements
with semi-colons.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.554
Got it.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.232
So that's Virusylum.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.157
I would not wanna be
locked up in here.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.997
State your business.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.665
We've got a present for you.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.084
Virus detected.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.921
The Dis will accept your deposit.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.886
They don't mess around.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.596
No kidding.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.765
I hope D-Frag made it to his coding test.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.350
I just hope he passes.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.411
He's got a good chance
if he remembers his semi-colons.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.063
- Googz.
- What? They're really important.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.916
<i>And now this
breaking news bulletin.</i>

18:04.000 --> 18:06.752
<i>A shocking theft from
Pogo Computer Systems</i>

18:06.836 --> 18:09.171
<i>has the tech world reeling.</i>

18:09.255 --> 18:10.965
<i>The thief, dubbed "the sorcerer",</i>

18:11.048 --> 18:14.468
<i>is being praised by the hacker
community for the cyber attack</i>

18:14.552 --> 18:17.638
<i>that deactivated the building's
security and allowed him</i>

18:17.722 --> 18:20.891
<i>to walk off with
the Nova X3J prototype.</i>

18:20.975 --> 18:24.061
<i>The sorcerer's identity and
whereabouts are unknown,</i>

18:24.145 --> 18:27.148
<i>and what he'll do now
that he has the Nova X3J</i>

18:27.231 --> 18:29.191
<i>is anyone's guess.</i>

18:31.152 --> 18:33.195
This Nova X3J.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.572
What's so special about it?

18:35.031 --> 18:38.576
Everything. It's Pogo's masterpiece.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.955
30 cores, 60 threads, a monster cache.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.707
Unlimited speed, I mean,

18:44.790 --> 18:47.585
it has a 100,000 terabyte bandwidth.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.605
The catch is it can connect
to the internet without Wi-Fi

18:49.629 --> 18:53.549
so if the sorcerer has it
he can launch an untraceable attack

18:53.633 --> 18:54.634
from anywhere.

18:54.717 --> 18:59.305
So Megabyte's cat virus was
only meant as a distraction.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.598
Yeah.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.143
Stealing the Nova X3J was
the real plan all along.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.605
This sorcerer is bad news.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.316
And he's got Megabyte working with him.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.234
That's worse news.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.155
Hey, how'd the test go?

19:20.743 --> 19:21.869
Aced it.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.204
Yes!

19:24.246 --> 19:25.956
Thanks for the semi-colon tip, Parker.

19:26.040 --> 19:26.874
No problem.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.293
So you're still on
the basketball team?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.837
Yeah, as long as I can
keep up a B average.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.547
I have total faith in you.

19:33.631 --> 19:34.465
Thanks.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.051
It feels good not to let
either team down.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.803
Or your dad.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.389
Yeah, that too.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.184
So Vera,

19:46.102 --> 19:50.064
any uh... Any luck figuring out
what this thing is?

19:50.147 --> 19:52.525
I'm in the process of trying
to decode it.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.860
It has a very unusual file format.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.613
So far none of the applications
I have used

19:57.697 --> 19:59.782
have delivered a positive result.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.034
Bless you.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.870
Bless you.

20:09.792 --> 20:10.918
Vera?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.045
Yes?

20:13.838 --> 20:16.257
Is there a cat in here?

20:26.392 --> 20:27.977
This is Hashtag.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.895
My new pet.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.690
Vera, where did you get it?

20:32.773 --> 20:34.692
I found him outside the school.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.865
Vera, this cat's name is Duncan.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.325
This is somebody else's pet.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.870
You're gonna have to return him.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.874
Oh, all right.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.667
I'll do it.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.006
You crack open that sphere.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.050
I've got a feeling it's gonna be
important somehow.
