00:35.540 --> 00:36.990
What you thinking about?

00:38.460 --> 00:39.590
My brother.

00:42.550 --> 00:43.680
What about him?

00:45.460 --> 00:46.580
Nothing.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.000
Something happened to him, didn't it?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.340
Lots of things happened to him.

00:55.030 --> 00:57.220
He was born almost a month late.

00:57.410 --> 00:58.875
Won a poetry competition
when he was eight.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.457
And met Sarah Ferguson.

01:01.980 --> 01:05.530
Got the highest mark for first
year essay in Cardiff history.

01:05.870 --> 01:08.230
And somewhere in there.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.859
He was hit by a bus.

01:09.860 --> 01:11.180
And nearly killed.

01:11.810 --> 01:12.800
Right?

01:14.870 --> 01:16.370
Why didn't you tell me about that?

01:18.190 --> 01:19.300
Why that?

01:20.030 --> 01:21.409
Why not the good stuff?

01:21.410 --> 01:23.270
Because I'm not interested in it.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.300
Tell me what happened to
your brother, Elizabeth?

01:32.190 --> 01:33.360
From the start.

01:38.716 --> 01:45.018
* set the sails I feel
the winds are stirring *

01:48.891 --> 01:55.415
* toward the bright horizon set the way *

01:56.166 --> 02:02.939
Ok, on three, one, two,

02:02.940 --> 02:05.220
yambai! Stop it!

02:09.880 --> 02:11.320
Come here fucker!

02:21.480 --> 02:28.180
* and who could heed the
words of Charlie Darwin *

02:32.305 --> 02:39.025
* fighting for a system built to fail *

02:49.230 --> 02:50.960
Ohh! You said you were cold.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.330
I don't recognise it.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.170
It's Freddie's.

03:00.830 --> 03:02.271
Oh do you want me to get you another one?

03:02.271 --> 03:05.620
No it's fine. I'll keep it.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.880
You are doing so well sweetheart.

03:28.670 --> 03:32.010
There's a bus coming Tony doesn't see it.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.050
He's distracted.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.070
It hits him, runs him over.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.750
He's in the gutter and he's bleeding.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.180
He looks dead.

03:50.570 --> 03:51.760
Open your eyes.

03:56.550 --> 03:57.930
Well done, Elizabeth.

03:58.820 --> 04:01.500
It's taken you three weeks
to tell me that story.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.950
- How do you feel?
- Awful.

04:08.190 --> 04:10.150
I'd like us try something new.

04:11.110 --> 04:13.060
I want you to close your eyes again.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.370
And imagine that bus never hit Tony.

04:17.610 --> 04:19.040
Can you do that for me?

04:19.100 --> 04:21.920
- But it did hit him.
- It's just an exercise.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.310
Try to imagine it never happened.

04:27.370 --> 04:28.460
Ok.

04:32.690 --> 04:34.270
Make a picture in your head.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.240
What do you see?

04:40.310 --> 04:44.360
Tony standing by the road.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.160
He's laughing.

04:47.350 --> 04:48.650
Good.

04:53.970 --> 04:55.100
Afternoon.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.169
How's the real world?

04:59.170 --> 05:00.340
Fine.

05:05.860 --> 05:10.160
Well I don't know actually.

05:10.290 --> 05:11.450
Me and Emily.

05:12.330 --> 05:16.629
We're all... since... the ...

05:16.630 --> 05:20.080
You know, and I don't
know what we're doing.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.180
If we're ok or if we're about to break up.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.800
Sometimes I think she can read my mind.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.580
I seriously do.

05:29.550 --> 05:32.119
I mean is that normal?

05:32.120 --> 05:34.670
Is that what you...?

05:38.230 --> 05:39.340
Eff?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.969
You think you're going
mad so you came to see me,

05:41.970 --> 05:44.209
to see what a mad person looks like?

05:44.210 --> 05:45.450
No!

05:46.700 --> 05:47.720
No.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.170
No.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.519
Yes.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.889
Listen to me very carefully Naomi.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.470
You need to get a message to
the dog lord of Azerbaijan.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.800
He's got my toilet ticket.

06:07.180 --> 06:09.410
Oh God what are they giving you?!

06:09.440 --> 06:10.580
And can I have some?

06:12.130 --> 06:15.760
This whole thing with this girl, Sophia.

06:16.650 --> 06:19.090
Why don't you just
imagine it never happened?

06:21.710 --> 06:22.860
But it did.

06:23.100 --> 06:27.670
Yeah, but if you tried to
think like you didn't...

06:27.930 --> 06:28.990
But...

06:32.500 --> 06:34.560
Am I missing something?

06:35.890 --> 06:38.379
You can't change what's already happened.

06:38.380 --> 06:39.680
I wish you could.

06:40.910 --> 06:45.460
But... you just can't.

06:57.769 --> 06:59.369
Please go on Elizabeth.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.979
The boy is crying.

07:05.279 --> 07:06.359
And his mother.

07:08.059 --> 07:09.589
And his little sister.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.899
He doesn't want him to go.

07:12.169 --> 07:13.539
What happens next?

07:13.609 --> 07:16.409
And then et says,

07:17.529 --> 07:20.359
"I'll be right here".

07:21.729 --> 07:24.339
And then he gets in the
spaceship and flies away.

07:25.469 --> 07:28.279
Yeah yeah that's right,
make fun of the old man!

07:31.939 --> 07:34.789
I think you're ready
to go home, Elizabeth.

07:35.679 --> 07:36.739
What?

07:38.299 --> 07:39.658
I'm not ready we're not finished yet.

07:39.659 --> 07:43.398
Oh we're far from finished.
You'll be seeing me twice a week.

07:43.399 --> 07:46.719
So I just go home, back to normal?

07:48.859 --> 07:52.928
Stick to your routine,
and no drink or drugs.

07:52.929 --> 07:56.749
But yes, pretty much back to normal.

07:59.199 --> 08:00.419
You can go.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.629
Thank you.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.649
We'll see each other soon.

08:52.519 --> 08:54.328
* easy lover *

08:54.329 --> 08:58.599
* she'll get a hold on you believe it *

09:00.089 --> 09:01.788
* like no other *

09:01.789 --> 09:06.349
* before you know it
you'll be on your knees... *

09:07.859 --> 09:09.819
I cleaned up a bit.

09:20.349 --> 09:23.439
Did a bit of soring out, is it all right?

09:23.769 --> 09:24.859
I love it.

09:35.299 --> 09:37.389
I've put everything away.

09:40.049 --> 09:43.039
It's tidier, don't you think?

09:48.179 --> 09:50.709
I've made this plan for you.

09:51.149 --> 09:55.269
I just thought it might
help you plan your days.

10:00.669 --> 10:03.039
Oh, you found Pato.

10:03.169 --> 10:03.908
He was under your bed.

10:03.909 --> 10:05.889
Come on, you funny giraffe.

10:09.549 --> 10:11.759
You can have that back, too.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.629
Now, don't speak to any bad man.

10:26.529 --> 10:27.779
Shit.

10:31.989 --> 10:37.629
* send my fond regards to Lonelyville *

10:41.349 --> 10:47.489
* I'm staying in my
well-appointed valley on the hill *

10:50.159 --> 10:56.329
* oh I'll grow hale on seawater... *

10:58.279 --> 11:04.289
* and leave something to
loneliness sweet William will *

11:08.059 --> 11:14.109
* I once was there to find the
girl that mystic morning's Eve *

11:16.849 --> 11:22.479
* there in the shade with
all the things up its leaves *

11:24.939 --> 11:31.589
* waking to the marvel, to
be northern, to be free *

11:33.399 --> 11:36.223
* you can hear the
sound of southern bells *

11:36.223 --> 11:39.199
* follow where she please *

11:43.059 --> 11:49.619
* some with the forked tongues
they'd love again to unlearn *

11:50.319 --> 11:54.858
* some for a heart a brushed
yet stainless urn... *

11:54.859 --> 11:56.369
Err...

11:58.419 --> 12:00.249
I've brought your jumper back.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.149
"Good to see you, Effy?"

12:04.489 --> 12:06.319
Jesus Christ

12:06.759 --> 12:08.798
Effy, it's fucking better than that.

12:08.799 --> 12:10.819
Oh, my God.

12:22.859 --> 12:24.689
Why didn't you let me see you, Eff?

12:28.059 --> 12:30.579
Because of the treatment John gave me.

12:31.789 --> 12:33.909
He didn't want me to see anyone.

12:35.049 --> 12:36.079
John?

12:37.019 --> 12:39.909
John Foster, my counselor.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.579
He's the one that helped me.

12:43.469 --> 12:45.619
And what did he do that was so special?

12:48.479 --> 12:50.539
He took all my bad memories.

12:50.989 --> 12:52.199
And made them good.

12:54.479 --> 12:56.609
And some of those memories
were about me, right?

12:58.159 --> 12:59.559
Only a few.

13:01.039 --> 13:02.645
Ok, if I'd have visited you,

13:02.645 --> 13:04.110
it would have fucked up John's treatment?

13:04.110 --> 13:05.379
Is that what you're saying?

13:07.419 --> 13:10.789
Yeah, I'm sorry

13:20.139 --> 13:21.239
Freddie...

13:24.479 --> 13:25.639
I'm sorry.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.169
The bad memories about me.

13:32.009 --> 13:33.509
You don't like...

13:35.029 --> 13:36.629
Feel them anymore?

13:41.959 --> 13:44.869
No, they're gone.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.459
He took them away.

13:49.919 --> 13:51.529
But do you know what's left?

13:52.489 --> 13:53.559
Love.

13:55.069 --> 13:57.569
All I feel for you now is love.

13:58.509 --> 13:59.889
Nothing else.

14:06.689 --> 14:10.728
* what's that you hide behind your back? *

14:10.729 --> 14:14.398
* nothing but a shadow trap *

14:14.399 --> 14:17.798
* what's that you pressed
against your lips *

14:17.799 --> 14:21.468
* set sail with words on conjured ships *

14:21.469 --> 14:24.748
* and in those ocean eyes of yours *

14:24.749 --> 14:28.208
* sea monsters swimming put in drawers *

14:28.209 --> 14:32.399
* I'm scared they'll climb
out when you leave... *

14:33.479 --> 14:37.649
we're ok, we're ok we're ok.

14:39.869 --> 14:45.429
* they stay down deep *

14:47.549 --> 14:52.888
* oh what's that you
hide behind your back? *

14:52.889 --> 14:58.099
* nothing but a shadow trap... *

15:33.499 --> 15:34.188
Hello?

15:34.189 --> 15:38.412
Oh my God, it's you! I
can't believe it's you!

15:39.629 --> 15:40.978
I don't even know why I'm bothering.

15:40.979 --> 15:43.888
I know I'm failed. Useless as usual.

15:43.889 --> 15:46.518
At least you took yours, I was too mental.

15:46.519 --> 15:48.008
So you're mental and I'm useless.

15:48.009 --> 15:50.439
It's shame we'd have fit
right in at Cambridge.

15:51.019 --> 15:52.849
Let's find out what I got.

15:59.569 --> 16:02.629
* I never took the time *

16:03.309 --> 16:06.019
* to catch you on my side... *

16:07.159 --> 16:09.378
Hey good luck!

16:09.379 --> 16:11.069
Well done girls.

16:11.609 --> 16:14.968
Ah, Ms. Moon, Ms. Stonem.

16:14.969 --> 16:16.629
Good to see you up and about.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.178
I suppose this is the last
time we'll see each other.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.508
Oh, I'll come back to see you Doug.

16:20.509 --> 16:24.259
Yes well, massive attack
said the same thing.

16:24.579 --> 16:26.751
Though daddy G writes at Christmas

16:26.751 --> 16:28.188
and on my birthday.

16:28.549 --> 16:30.549
Though he's missed the last two.

16:31.369 --> 16:34.609
Anyhow, here you go, Ms. Moon.

16:37.099 --> 16:39.099
A c? Ok.

16:39.469 --> 16:40.448
Listen Eff, I need to
tell you something...

16:40.449 --> 16:43.858
Doug, I want to retake. What do I...?

16:43.859 --> 16:45.938
Yes, er, about that...

16:45.939 --> 16:47.719
Would you come with me?

16:48.569 --> 16:49.749
What is it?

16:50.409 --> 16:52.419
Mr blood wants to see you.

16:54.339 --> 16:57.268
It's been a good year here
at Roundview, Elizabeth.

16:57.269 --> 17:00.908
Every single student
received A to C grades.

17:00.909 --> 17:01.858
Really?

17:01.859 --> 17:05.749
Well, we had a lot of
people doing media studies.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.769
Nevertheless, our targets were met.

17:08.799 --> 17:11.358
Except by you.

17:11.358 --> 17:13.528
You failed everything.

17:13.529 --> 17:14.979
Yeah I know.

17:15.739 --> 17:17.358
I didn't even sit the exam.

17:17.398 --> 17:19.518
Which brings down the college average

17:19.519 --> 17:23.397
and affects the funding scenario.

17:23.398 --> 17:24.938
Do you see my dilemma?

17:24.939 --> 17:26.608
I can retake, right?

17:26.659 --> 17:28.629
It wouldn't make a difference.

17:35.129 --> 17:37.869
Let me level with you Elizabeth.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.489
Here are your old results.

17:56.329 --> 18:00.549
And here...

18:00.949 --> 18:03.549
Are your new results.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.739
Please act as such.

18:10.479 --> 18:11.488
Three As?

18:11.489 --> 18:14.018
An excellent result,
considering your circumstances.

18:14.019 --> 18:17.079
You want me to tell people I got three as?

18:17.599 --> 18:23.038
In my experience, Ms. Stonem,
we are all living lies.

18:23.039 --> 18:29.019
Reality, as the sophists so elegantly
informed us, is all relative.

18:29.999 --> 18:31.799
Now go on, go out with you.

18:42.429 --> 18:45.749
It feels wrong. It's like cheating.

18:46.069 --> 18:47.729
It's like cheating at life.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.818
And now I'm starting to
wonder about everything.

18:49.819 --> 18:52.899
Elizabeth, what's really going on?

18:53.879 --> 18:57.169
What do you mean? That,
what I just told you.

19:01.999 --> 19:03.719
We talked at length...

19:04.289 --> 19:06.768
At length... about this, Elizabeth.

19:06.769 --> 19:12.669
Achievement, success, academic or
otherwise, earned or not, is nothing

19:12.929 --> 19:15.338
- compare to being well and being happy.
- Yeah but...

19:15.339 --> 19:16.939
Happiness.

19:17.709 --> 19:18.919
Correct?

19:20.009 --> 19:21.169
Yes.

19:21.609 --> 19:22.719
You're right.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.399
You're right.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.909
These don't matter.

19:31.299 --> 19:33.359
There are bigger things happening here.

19:34.009 --> 19:35.329
Bigger than school.

19:36.739 --> 19:38.169
Bigger than friends.

19:40.799 --> 19:42.429
Even bigger than love.

19:45.069 --> 19:46.149
Ok?

19:46.699 --> 19:47.689
Ok

20:16.099 --> 20:21.309
right now that Effy's here and
we're all suitably refreshed.

20:22.019 --> 20:23.068
Speech!

20:23.069 --> 20:26.878
The exam result party
planning committee have decreed

20:26.879 --> 20:32.799
that all our results be read out
in quick succession. So, ready...

20:33.219 --> 20:34.379
A, A, B!

20:37.459 --> 20:39.339
A, A, A!

20:41.399 --> 20:42.759
B, B, C!

20:44.059 --> 20:45.579
C in philosophy!

20:46.799 --> 20:48.409
B, C, C!

20:50.479 --> 20:51.809
A, C, C!

20:53.519 --> 20:54.679
I got expelled!

21:03.529 --> 21:04.559
Eff?

21:09.479 --> 21:11.539
It doesn't matter what I got.

21:11.939 --> 21:13.409
None of this matters.

21:14.069 --> 21:15.829
It's just numbers on a page.

21:16.819 --> 21:17.879
It's not real.

21:18.589 --> 21:19.879
Not to me anyway.

21:22.819 --> 21:26.149
You're all great. You're all great people.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.359
But I think...

21:31.349 --> 21:32.579
I think I'm finished.

21:33.719 --> 21:35.059
I think I've had enough.

21:36.969 --> 21:38.669
What are you talking about Eff?

21:40.169 --> 21:42.279
You have to make sacrifices, Fred,

21:42.349 --> 21:43.418
to get the stuff you want.

21:43.419 --> 21:44.298
I don't understand.

21:44.299 --> 21:46.009
I'm in a different place now.

21:46.559 --> 21:47.719
We all are.

21:48.669 --> 21:49.619
And I'm sorry.

21:50.619 --> 21:51.949
I'm really sorry.

21:52.289 --> 21:53.629
What are you saying?

21:56.189 --> 21:59.418
I'm saying goodbye, I have to.

21:59.419 --> 22:03.039
To everyone? To me?

22:03.969 --> 22:04.969
Yeah.

22:06.519 --> 22:07.819
To everyone.

22:09.619 --> 22:10.799
To you.

22:13.919 --> 22:15.639
Where the fuck are you going?

22:15.799 --> 22:16.829
Home.

22:22.039 --> 22:24.159
She dumped you again?!

22:29.799 --> 22:31.179
Hey, princess.

22:35.629 --> 22:38.029
Aren't you supposed to
be in prison or something?

22:39.399 --> 22:41.389
Aren't supposed to be in the loony bin?

22:42.239 --> 22:45.199
I did my time, you should have done yours.

22:46.159 --> 22:47.239
I did enough.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.749
Surely Effy Stonem's
not abandoning a party?

22:52.989 --> 22:54.269
I don't belong in there.

22:54.549 --> 22:57.169
Neither do I, we've got a
lot in common, me and you.

22:57.259 --> 22:58.299
Not any more.

23:00.019 --> 23:01.549
We're both stood in the rain.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.709
We're both miserable.

23:06.059 --> 23:07.628
You're no good for me, Cook.

23:07.629 --> 23:08.839
You never were.

23:13.009 --> 23:15.239
If this was us meeting for the first time.

23:16.379 --> 23:18.539
I'll do it all again. Everything.

23:19.299 --> 23:22.068
The fucks, the fuck-ups, everything.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.598
I'll do it all again.

23:23.599 --> 23:25.019
What's that supposed to mean?

23:25.669 --> 23:27.129
It means I still love you.

23:29.649 --> 23:30.879
Piss off.

24:02.979 --> 24:05.279
When I touch your little finger...

24:07.189 --> 24:09.689
You will be completely relaxed

24:12.479 --> 24:16.039
now, describe the room to me.

24:20.889 --> 24:22.379
It's dark.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.909
I can't see.

24:30.049 --> 24:31.939
The curtain's are closed.

24:37.779 --> 24:39.009
There's a man...

24:41.319 --> 24:43.039
Sitting on a chair.

24:46.339 --> 24:48.099
He's facing away from me.

24:52.969 --> 24:54.539
He's so full of hate.

24:58.049 --> 24:59.709
So full of death.

25:01.769 --> 25:07.899
What if he leaves? What if he's not there?

25:09.719 --> 25:11.409
What is he was never there?

25:15.019 --> 25:21.379
Open the curtains and
let the sun shine in.

25:24.649 --> 25:25.989
It's warm.

25:28.169 --> 25:30.199
Pato the funny giraffe is here.

25:32.229 --> 25:36.119
This is a place without fear or danger

25:36.559 --> 25:38.299
this is a safe place.

25:39.599 --> 25:40.789
Peaceful.

25:41.719 --> 25:43.359
Away from everyone...

25:44.489 --> 25:45.779
And everything,

25:47.759 --> 25:48.939
it's here.

25:50.829 --> 25:52.229
And you...

25:54.619 --> 25:56.039
Are wonderful.

26:18.423 --> 26:21.523
- What are you doing here?
- I want an explanation.

26:22.183 --> 26:23.993
- Freddie...
- Do you know what you've done to me?

26:23.993 --> 26:26.302
- Dumping me with no reason at all?
- I had reasons.

26:26.303 --> 26:28.156
Well, if the urge to tell
me any of them occurs,

26:28.156 --> 26:29.851
please let me know.

26:30.203 --> 26:33.523
Or did John steal your
soul as well as your past?

26:33.663 --> 26:36.113
- Tea and biscuits?
- Mum...

26:36.843 --> 26:38.053
All right...

26:39.533 --> 26:42.903
The night before you dumped me,
you told me that you loved me.

26:44.013 --> 26:45.023
I know.

26:45.093 --> 26:48.233
So look me in the eye and
tell me you don't love me now.

26:56.453 --> 26:58.363
Don't do that!

26:58.613 --> 27:00.783
I went crazy when I was with you.

27:00.983 --> 27:02.993
I can't let that happen again.

27:03.813 --> 27:06.052
Love's not supposed to do
that, you made me go mad!

27:06.053 --> 27:09.313
You're making me mad now, Effy.

27:10.353 --> 27:13.253
And that's exactly what
love's supposed to do.

27:49.763 --> 27:50.923
Effy?

27:50.923 --> 27:52.023
Yes?

27:52.073 --> 27:53.653
Are you all right?

27:54.313 --> 27:55.333
Yes.

27:55.703 --> 27:57.853
Did you remember your pills?

27:59.273 --> 28:00.503
Effy?

28:01.053 --> 28:02.083
Yeah.

28:03.133 --> 28:04.293
Love you.

28:21.123 --> 28:22.303
Pato?

28:26.543 --> 28:29.883
Where is he? Pato?

28:30.613 --> 28:31.763
Mum!

28:33.853 --> 28:34.712
What's wrong? What's the matter?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.633
I can't find pato!

28:37.173 --> 28:40.292
Eh, have you looked under bed?

28:40.293 --> 28:41.673
Of course I have!

28:43.243 --> 28:46.243
- Effy, Effy, don't worry.
- Pato!

28:46.363 --> 28:47.752
We'll find him.

28:48.239 --> 28:49.903
Where are you?!

28:57.283 --> 28:58.593
Pato?!

29:00.293 --> 29:05.393
Effy, Effy.

29:05.783 --> 29:06.913
Effy.

29:10.703 --> 29:12.423
He was behind the bed.

29:51.333 --> 29:55.583
I don't think this is right,
burning all your things.

29:56.693 --> 29:57.803
I need John.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.063
He'll make me better.

30:02.583 --> 30:03.843
Ok.

31:03.213 --> 31:04.533
Here she is.

31:13.673 --> 31:15.543
It's not good for you, that.

31:17.183 --> 31:19.403
That has never bothered you before.

31:20.643 --> 31:24.053
You know, I walk through
this park every day.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.263
I've never noticed there's a pond here.

31:26.953 --> 31:28.143
Can you believe that?

31:28.703 --> 31:30.333
Every day for years.

31:30.743 --> 31:33.853
And then today, bam.

31:34.073 --> 31:35.693
Like it came out of nowhere.

31:36.323 --> 31:37.903
What the fuck are you on about?

31:40.113 --> 31:42.973
Yeah yeah, I know,
"piss off" and all that.

31:43.333 --> 31:44.433
What?

31:46.153 --> 31:50.163
Listen, I got a call from
your man. He's all in a tizzy.

31:51.733 --> 31:54.323
So I thought I'd come and hear
your side of the story, like.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.203
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

31:59.813 --> 32:00.973
Come on, Eff

32:01.623 --> 32:02.643
Eff?

32:03.353 --> 32:04.433
Who's Eff?

32:08.643 --> 32:10.982
Yeah, of course, sorry.

32:10.983 --> 32:12.363
You're not Effy.

32:13.363 --> 32:15.853
I've mistaken you for someone else.

32:17.593 --> 32:18.863
Looks like it.

32:24.483 --> 32:25.903
So what is your name?

32:29.683 --> 32:30.843
Elizabeth.

32:32.983 --> 32:35.252
Elizabeth, nice to meet you.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.433
I'm James.

33:18.653 --> 33:20.952
I wouldn't normally go for a drink,
let alone a dance with someone.

33:20.953 --> 33:23.643
- I've just met.
- Yeah?

33:24.353 --> 33:25.533
So why did you?

33:27.413 --> 33:28.792
You seem nice.

33:28.793 --> 33:30.203
I am nice.

33:33.273 --> 33:35.643
So, what are we doing next, mystery girl?

33:38.543 --> 33:39.793
Something bad.

33:41.913 --> 33:43.313
You've come to the right man.

34:08.652 --> 34:12.253
Oh, deja  vu.

34:12.862 --> 34:16.003
Yeah, ain't that the French
for "what the fuck is going on?"

34:17.333 --> 34:18.643
No.

34:19.453 --> 34:21.223
I've been here before.

34:22.963 --> 34:24.783
Something bad happened here.

34:25.973 --> 34:27.112
What?

34:29.183 --> 34:30.553
I was screaming.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.233
Someone got hurt.

34:36.063 --> 34:39.503
Ok, this is getting way too
much Stephen king for me.

34:40.652 --> 34:42.813
You win, all right? I call chicken.

34:44.703 --> 34:46.143
Someone got hurt.

34:47.373 --> 34:49.023
What are you talking about?

34:49.132 --> 34:51.223
What am I talking about? Come on, Eff

34:51.533 --> 34:53.373
I know you, you know me.

34:54.862 --> 34:58.743
We've dated, we have fucked
in every sense of the word.

35:00.213 --> 35:01.812
We are Cook and Effy.

35:01.813 --> 35:04.042
No, tha... that's not
true, we've never met.

35:04.043 --> 35:05.737
So how do I know you've got a mark

35:05.737 --> 35:07.435
shaped like a wine glass on your arse?

35:07.593 --> 35:09.403
Or that your favourite film is et?

35:09.443 --> 35:10.443
Stop it.

35:10.643 --> 35:11.602
That's because we know each other.

35:11.602 --> 35:13.001
The fucking world knows us.

35:13.173 --> 35:14.443
So cut the fucking shit...

35:22.723 --> 35:26.073
My brother, he got hit.

35:26.453 --> 35:28.043
He got run over here.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.412
No, that never happened, that
never happened! You never happened!

35:32.413 --> 35:34.912
Yes it did, it did.

35:34.913 --> 35:36.503
What's happening to me?

35:36.993 --> 35:39.093
It happened, but it never happened.

35:39.293 --> 35:40.612
It happened, but it never happened.

35:40.613 --> 35:42.963
- It happened, but it never happened.
- Stop it!

35:46.653 --> 35:49.273
- Hit me again.
- No!

35:49.853 --> 35:52.393
What's wrong with me? Hit me again!

35:52.783 --> 35:54.113
I'm not scared.

35:54.773 --> 35:56.592
I'm not scared of anything. Hit me.

35:56.593 --> 35:58.623
Effy, please stop.

35:58.723 --> 36:00.043
I can't!

36:22.153 --> 36:24.197
Eff! Get out the road, man!

36:24.197 --> 36:25.933
I'm not scared!

36:26.313 --> 36:30.302
I want to be scared! I want to be hurt!

36:30.303 --> 36:33.533
I want to remember! I'm not scared!

36:33.693 --> 36:36.563
I'm not scared! I'm not scared!

36:36.603 --> 36:40.563
Come on! Come on! Come on!

36:51.163 --> 36:52.903
Take me to Freddie, Cook.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.202
You need to get me to him.

36:55.203 --> 36:57.633
You need to get me
there. I need to tell him.

36:59.693 --> 37:02.163
You remember me, though,
yeah? You know who I am?

37:03.223 --> 37:04.823
How could I forget?

37:05.883 --> 37:07.333
You're my friend.

37:23.573 --> 37:25.659
- "Emergency..."
- Yes, an ambulance, please.

37:26.009 --> 37:28.089
It's for my girlf.... my friend.

37:29.389 --> 37:31.239
She's not right, I don't...

37:31.739 --> 37:33.649
She's been sectioned before.

37:35.619 --> 37:38.979
Yeah, it's 82 Peveril Road.

37:39.689 --> 37:41.889
That's the one, yeah, ok.

37:45.989 --> 37:48.249
You fucking skipping out on me, man?

37:52.869 --> 37:56.548
Yeah, I'm leaving, I
was going to go tonight

37:56.549 --> 37:58.079
you were going to fuck off?

37:58.409 --> 37:59.429
Leave her?

37:59.669 --> 38:02.468
Cook, she broke my heart man.

38:02.469 --> 38:04.189
She broke my heart as well.

38:04.549 --> 38:05.759
You broke my heart.

38:07.139 --> 38:09.229
I bet you've broken hers at some point.

38:11.529 --> 38:12.335
So what are we gonna do?

38:12.335 --> 38:15.079
Are we just three losers
screwing each other for ever?

38:15.549 --> 38:17.099
Or are we something better than that?

38:23.119 --> 38:24.759
Fuck, mate, grow up.

38:25.749 --> 38:26.969
Cos I'm done here.

38:29.929 --> 38:31.698
Thanks for bringing her to me.

38:31.699 --> 38:33.899
Where the fuck else would I bring her?

38:35.509 --> 38:37.189
Don't screw it up.

38:44.459 --> 38:46.878
* I've been thinking *

38:46.879 --> 38:49.198
* all my wandering *

38:49.199 --> 38:54.108
* on the way home from your house *

38:54.109 --> 38:58.968
* that I love you in the way I do *

38:58.969 --> 39:03.672
* and if there'll ever be someone else *

39:04.078 --> 39:10.028
* you're young and you're
stable stand up to your label *

39:10.029 --> 39:13.278
* you're young and you're able *

39:13.279 --> 39:18.528
* but you need your saviour *

39:18.529 --> 39:23.388
* oh you'll need your saviour *

39:23.389 --> 39:27.968
* young believers, come and see her *

39:27.969 --> 39:32.588
* she has pushed into the ground *

39:32.589 --> 39:34.968
* though with one hand *

39:34.969 --> 39:37.278
* he could break her *

39:37.279 --> 39:39.839
* with one hand... *

39:39.989 --> 39:41.569
Effy? Are you all right?

39:44.289 --> 39:45.588
I'm back where I was.

39:45.589 --> 39:48.699
Yeah, you're back in hospital.

39:50.179 --> 39:54.459
No. In here.

39:55.909 --> 39:59.569
In here I can hear the voices again.

40:00.249 --> 40:01.569
Ok, I'm here.

40:03.249 --> 40:04.762
I didn't mean what I said to you.

40:04.762 --> 40:06.468
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

40:06.469 --> 40:07.608
I'm so stupid.

40:07.609 --> 40:11.979
It's all right. We're
together. We'll be together.

40:14.939 --> 40:17.839
Good morning. How are we doing?

40:19.309 --> 40:21.839
No, I don't want him anymore, Freddie.

40:25.919 --> 40:27.239
You're John Foster.

40:28.069 --> 40:29.389
And you must be Freddie.

40:29.529 --> 40:30.719
You need to leave.

40:31.589 --> 40:32.283
She's my patient.

40:32.283 --> 40:35.459
Not any more. We want someone else.

40:38.509 --> 40:39.669
You're done with her.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.689
Fuck off.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.579
You deserved better.

40:56.649 --> 41:00.099
Ssh, it's all right, just
go to sleep, all right?

41:00.549 --> 41:04.579
I love you, I love you.

41:05.319 --> 41:06.589
I love you.

41:07.809 --> 41:08.859
I love you.

41:10.519 --> 41:12.209
I love you.

41:19.829 --> 41:25.198
* my love is light as a dove *

41:25.199 --> 41:30.608
* and her skins is fair
and dark is her hair *

41:30.609 --> 41:36.308
* and her eyes dart 'round
and fall on the ground *

41:36.309 --> 41:43.209
* and her lips move alone
to an old country song... *

41:44.169 --> 41:45.808
I don't like this place.

41:45.809 --> 41:47.299
Neither do I.

41:49.729 --> 41:51.129
I'll look after her.

41:53.489 --> 41:58.668
* ...An old liquor store
where we danced on the floor *

41:58.669 --> 42:04.418
* oh the light on the wall
it brightens the hall *

42:04.419 --> 42:11.319
* but the room in the back
is quiet and black... *

42:26.879 --> 42:27.929
Hello?

42:30.189 --> 42:32.475
* her voice and her breath *

42:32.475 --> 42:39.189
* could I hear them sounds
in life underground? *

42:54.599 --> 42:55.244
Hello.

42:55.244 --> 43:01.788
* ... and her lips move
along to an old country song *

43:01.789 --> 43:03.319
Please.

43:05.489 --> 43:07.389
You do your counselling in here?

43:07.429 --> 43:09.019
You find it oppressive?

43:10.789 --> 43:12.399
It pacifies me.

43:13.709 --> 43:16.239
Although I suppose I should
brighten it up a little.

43:16.899 --> 43:19.039
My patients are my livelihood.

43:21.029 --> 43:24.650
Anyway, about Elizabeth, and
your reason for being here.

43:24.650 --> 43:26.899
Yeah man what the fuck
am I doing in your house?

43:28.299 --> 43:31.269
Elizabeth and her mother have expressed...

43:32.089 --> 43:36.199
Dissatisfaction with my methods.
It's perfectly understandable

43:36.329 --> 43:37.758
I am something of a Maverick.

43:37.759 --> 43:39.469
You never helped her at all.

43:39.489 --> 43:41.529
She's worse than she ever was now.

43:42.039 --> 43:45.909
Anyway, I'm hoping to keep
working with her regardless.

43:45.989 --> 43:47.098
There are some thing I haven't tried...

43:47.099 --> 43:48.279
Are you deaf?

43:48.349 --> 43:51.369
Listen, we don't want you.

43:52.059 --> 43:53.899
Just stay the fuck away.

43:54.939 --> 43:56.999
Indulge me a moment longer.

43:57.519 --> 44:01.038
I admit I was arrogant, stupid.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.389
I made mistakes.

44:06.079 --> 44:07.689
I got too close.

44:07.689 --> 44:09.029
I feel terrible.

44:12.239 --> 44:13.749
I care too much.

44:15.129 --> 44:17.579
Stay away from her.

44:22.779 --> 44:24.429
I'm too human.

44:27.509 --> 44:30.819
We're essentially creatures of instinct,

44:32.329 --> 44:33.869
passing whims.

44:35.399 --> 44:38.339
Are really a profound moment.

44:40.919 --> 44:43.029
Can't let you have her, I'm afraid.

44:45.379 --> 44:47.369
She really does love you, you know.

44:47.849 --> 44:48.968
Hey come on.

44:48.969 --> 44:50.489
Just open the door, yeah.

45:35.509 --> 45:37.459
- Something is odd.
- Karen, I've asked around.

45:37.649 --> 45:38.338
There's no sign for Freds.

45:38.339 --> 45:39.278
I love you.

45:39.279 --> 45:40.218
Don't lie.

45:40.219 --> 45:40.788
Freds?

45:40.789 --> 45:42.388
He's talking in my head.

45:42.389 --> 45:43.938
What's Fred saying?

45:43.939 --> 45:46.079
He's saying that they're all fucking mad.

45:46.509 --> 45:47.788
Thomas is coming around latter.

45:47.789 --> 45:49.398
He's giving me French
lessons for my interview.

45:49.399 --> 45:50.578
Hey, Fredster.

45:50.579 --> 45:51.468
Look where we ended up.

45:51.469 --> 45:53.678
All back at Naomi Cambells.

45:53.679 --> 45:54.818
You owe him, Cook.

45:54.819 --> 45:56.838
When you were fled last
year, who was looking for you.

45:56.839 --> 45:58.288
What kind of lame rave is this?

45:58.289 --> 45:59.368
I dressed up.

45:59.369 --> 46:01.758
You find him, you fucking find my brother!

46:01.759 --> 46:03.628
You've to forget about good and bad.

46:03.629 --> 46:05.302
I'll never forget you.

46:05.725 --> 46:09.079
R.I.P Freddie Mclair 1992-2010

46:09.757 --> 46:14.002
* that we can walk down, me and you *

46:15.999 --> 46:19.162

46:19.162 --> 46:22.033
