WEBVTT

00:17.930 --> 00:19.541
My fellow citizens,

00:19.671 --> 00:25.068
I am about to sign into law
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.417
<i>While the Civil Rights Act</i>

00:26.548 --> 00:28.376
<i>may have passed today,</i>

00:28.506 --> 00:30.378
<i>the streets of Harlem
are on fire at this hour,</i>

00:30.508 --> 00:32.684
<i>as riots and looting
break out over the shooting</i>

00:32.815 --> 00:34.686
<i>of an unarmed black teenager.</i>

00:34.817 --> 00:37.559
This is for Teddy.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.517
Ernie and Benny,
they didn't like each other.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.345
Ernie shot him
in the head.

00:41.476 --> 00:42.738
I want you
to take him out.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.827
Ernie and I
are married. I love him.

00:44.957 --> 00:48.178
I want you to protect him
as much as you do me.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.832
- Yeah.
- Boss, what are you doing here?

00:49.962 --> 00:51.355
- Where's Lombardi?
- He's right there.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.401
Lombardi, no!

00:53.531 --> 00:55.229
Ernie, I tried, all right?

00:55.359 --> 00:57.231
What's the matter,
boss? It's what you wanted.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.494
He should burn in hell
for what he's done.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.844
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I love you, all right?

01:01.974 --> 01:04.107
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.544
Sister Elise,
will you marry me?

01:06.675 --> 01:09.547
Captain Omar doesn't know
of your friendship with us?

01:09.678 --> 01:12.115
Were you at the home
of Malcolm X?

01:12.246 --> 01:13.421
Yes.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.727
Then leave this mosque immediately.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.208
You are a worthless
piece of garbage.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.341
Tonight Malcolm dies.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.212
Omar and Henry are
gonna ambush Malcolm

01:22.343 --> 01:23.692
after his television interview.

01:27.478 --> 01:28.479
This ain't over.

01:31.308 --> 01:33.571
With the biggest
duji shipment in history.

01:33.702 --> 01:34.746
Three thousand keys.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.574
I saw stores
up in flames,

01:36.705 --> 01:38.098
cop cars all over
the damn streets.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.403
We need to move
the duji somewhere else.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.883
Just keep everything
under control.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.410
There goes the fucking
French connection.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.761
Just like that. Up in flames.

<i>The Harlem riots have

04:48.462 --> 04:50.768
<i>after three days of chaos.</i>

04:50.899 --> 04:52.683
<i>It all started
when an off-duty cop</i>

04:52.814 --> 04:55.773
<i>shot a 15-year-old black boy,
James Powell,</i>

04:55.904 --> 04:57.862
<i>setting off a wave
of discontent</i>

04:57.993 --> 04:59.777
<i>through the Negro community</i>

04:59.908 --> 05:02.954
<i>just as the Civil Rights Act
was passed in Washington.</i>

05:03.085 --> 05:04.956
<i>Hundreds of National Guard
were called in,</i>

05:05.087 --> 05:07.785
<i>and millions of dollars
of destruction has all</i>

05:07.916 --> 05:10.527
<i>but leveled large parts
of the city.</i>

05:10.658 --> 05:13.400
<i>Thousands of protestors
attacked police officers,</i>

05:13.530 --> 05:16.446
<i>which rapidly degenerated
into wanton looting,</i>

05:16.577 --> 05:18.622
<i>as vandals destroyed storefronts</i>

05:18.753 --> 05:20.320
<i>and violence
spread like a plague.</i>

05:20.450 --> 05:22.887
They act like we brought this
on ourselves.

05:23.018 --> 05:25.629
Like we want a reason
to burn down our homes.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.675
It's the news' job
to keep little old white ladies

05:27.805 --> 05:30.895
clutching their purses
whenever we walk by.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.767
Somebody's son is dead.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.998
You've been awfully quiet.

05:48.478 --> 05:51.002
Mayme, I had it.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.483
The French connection.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.964
Thousands of kilos
under my control.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.487
The Italians
were buying from me.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.097
I was in charge.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.926
I dotted every "I."
I crossed every "T."

06:02.797 --> 06:04.886
And then Harlem spits fire
in my face,

06:05.016 --> 06:06.583
and everything just
goes up in smoke.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.933
Baby, no one could have
anticipated these riots.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.022
Now I look like a joke.

06:11.153 --> 06:14.112
I'm crawling back to
the Italians with my checkbook.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.680
Millions of dollars
in the hole.

06:16.811 --> 06:20.423
And I was supposed to be
their boss for good.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.600
You took a hit,
and it hurts,

06:23.731 --> 06:27.430
just like Harlem did
with these riots,

06:27.561 --> 06:30.999
but we will rebuild
and come back better

06:31.129 --> 06:34.524
and stronger than ever.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.744
And so will you.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.833
You'll see.

06:43.011 --> 06:47.015
These riots weren't
just about Harlem.

06:47.145 --> 06:54.152
You name the city, the Black
man's anger is here, fermenting.

06:54.283 --> 06:58.896
It was stones yesterday,
Molotov cocktails today.

06:59.027 --> 07:02.073
It will be
hand grenades tomorrow.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.426
I'm not inciting violence,

07:06.556 --> 07:09.516
just warning
of a powder-keg situation.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.779
You can take it or leave it.

07:11.909 --> 07:16.000
But if you ignore it
or ridicule it, well,

07:16.131 --> 07:19.656
death is already
at your doorstep.

07:20.701 --> 07:24.226
<i>History demonstrates
that nothing,</i>

07:24.356 --> 07:27.969
<i>nothing prepares a way
for tyranny</i>

07:28.099 --> 07:29.797
<i>more than the failure
of public officials</i>

07:29.927 --> 07:33.061
<i>to keep the streets safe
from bullies and marauders.</i>

07:35.585 --> 07:37.065
That sonofabitch.

07:39.676 --> 07:40.764
<i>Now--</i>

07:43.637 --> 07:47.771
Goldwater is laying those riots
right at my doorstep.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.947
Distorting
my whole record.

07:50.078 --> 07:55.257
Saying I'm soft on crime,
soft on Communism.

07:55.387 --> 08:00.001
He even thinks I'm too soft
to drop a goddamn nuclear bomb.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.698
Well, I assure you,
Mr. President,

08:01.829 --> 08:05.180
that Negro voters
don't believe that.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.707
I ain't worried
about Negro voters.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.014
I'm worried
about white ones.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.930
No sooner do I sign
the Civil Rights Act

08:16.060 --> 08:17.497
than riots break out.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.977
If this spreads
to other cities,

08:20.108 --> 08:21.979
Goldwater's gonna win
the goddamn presidency.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.286
Well, sir, the millions
of dollars

08:24.416 --> 08:26.593
that you have bestowed
upon urban communities

08:26.723 --> 08:30.901
in the wake
of these disturbances

08:31.032 --> 08:36.516
will help restore
the Negro's faith in government.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.822
A man with a Molotov cocktail
in his hand

08:38.953 --> 08:41.303
is not fighting
for civil rights

08:41.433 --> 08:45.002
any more than a Klansman
with a sheet on his back.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.178
They're both lawbreakers
and criminals.

08:47.309 --> 08:52.619
With one essential difference,
if I may.

08:54.185 --> 08:58.538
One will kill
to protect what he has.

08:58.668 --> 09:04.195
The other to demand
what he hasn't.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.555
I'm adding it up.

09:15.685 --> 09:16.947
Let's see what we got.

09:19.341 --> 09:24.955
And that is the sum total
of all your assets at hand.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.132
That include
the Geechee Club?

09:28.263 --> 09:30.874
Geechee's got a banknote.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.963
The principal
is only $200,000.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.227
How much we got out
on the street?

09:36.358 --> 09:40.580
Between bookmaking and loans,
I figure half a million.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.756
Get out there and collect from
anyone who owes us a nickel.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.061
Niggas is broke, Bump.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.715
Can't squeeze blood
from a stone.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.718
Yeah, man, you took a loss.
So should the guineas.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.025
I gave my word that I'd deliver.
I keep my word.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.593
Hit the streets.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.246
Alright.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.685
Miss Willa.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.907
You know, the interest
on $3 million

10:04.038 --> 10:06.954
is $400,000...a week.

10:07.084 --> 10:10.218
You're just not equipped
to carry that kind of debt.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.613
What's that on your sleeve?

10:14.875 --> 10:16.354
- Charcoal?
- Oh.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.618
They torched the building, child.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.011
Fire department
didn't even show up.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.405
- Where you staying?
- My sister's.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.581
She got four kids.
Why didn't you tell me?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.757
What was I gonna tell you?

10:27.888 --> 10:30.107
Listen, you got problems
of your own.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.981
What are you doing?
Don't do that.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.287
A grand ain't gonna make
a difference, more or less.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.898
Find yourself a place.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.384
Thank you.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.961
I pay my debts.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.746
You guys know that.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.270
No one could have predicted
that riot.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.620
Bumpy, can I ask you
a question?

11:04.751 --> 11:05.969
Fire away.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.146
I understand why the Negroes
are really angry

11:09.277 --> 11:11.322
because the cops
killed that kid,

11:11.453 --> 11:14.978
but why the fuck do you burn
your own neighborhoods down?

11:15.109 --> 11:16.153
We don't own
the neighborhoods.

11:16.284 --> 11:17.938
White folks do.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.243
Stealing, looting--

11:19.374 --> 11:22.812
it doesn't reflect
very well on your people.

11:22.943 --> 11:28.078
We steal--you, me,
the Five Families.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.038
The American Mafia
was founded because

11:31.168 --> 11:32.735
Italians couldn't even get
a fair shake in this country,

11:32.866 --> 11:34.694
let alone how could a Negro?

11:34.824 --> 11:36.304
Enough history lessons, yeah?

11:36.434 --> 11:39.046
I need some time.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.918
Then I can square it
with each and every one of you.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.488
You have to see Joe Colombo.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.100
The capo in the Profaci Family?

11:50.231 --> 11:52.755
It's the Colombo Family now.

11:52.886 --> 11:56.324
After Profaci died, we elevated
him to the boss of the family.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.240
Or should I say,
Chin elevated him.

11:59.370 --> 12:02.896
Any monies due,
you owe to Joe Colombo.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.506
Well...

12:06.856 --> 12:09.032
I hope he's reasonable
like you, Tommy.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.512
Don't count on it.

12:10.642 --> 12:13.384
You know these kids today.
They're out of control.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.256
Hey.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.127
I know Chin's in
jail, so that's why he sent you,

12:17.258 --> 12:20.261
but Tommy Lucchese
can't bother to see me himself?

12:20.391 --> 12:23.003
I'm his associate,
you fucking prick.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.352
Now, Tommy wants to know
when he's getting his money

12:24.482 --> 12:26.093
back from that nigger
Bumpy Johnson.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.398
I'm working on it.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.400
Gio, it's only been
a couple of days.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.402
Why Chin wanted this
wet-behind-the-ears mammone

12:31.533 --> 12:32.882
to collect his debt
is beyond me.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.057
Chin trusts him.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.929
- Ah, fuck you, Lombardi.
- Oh.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.887
Chin pushed for him to be
the head of the Profaci Family

12:38.018 --> 12:39.933
so he could be his puppet.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.804
What, am I not even here?

12:43.893 --> 12:46.069
- Hey, Gio.
- Yeah?

12:46.200 --> 12:47.810
You wanna see something?

12:49.551 --> 12:50.770
Come on.
Let me show you something.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.249
Let me show you
why Chin has faith.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.034
Come here.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.778
Now, all the bosses,
except for Chin,

12:58.908 --> 13:02.390
see me
as a two-bit car thief, right?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.784
But these cars

13:04.914 --> 13:07.351
are what's gonna let us bring
in so much dope from France,

13:07.482 --> 13:08.962
we're gonna be swimming in it.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.790
Now, look at this wreck.

13:10.920 --> 13:15.359
Who would even inspect
the fuckin' thing? Eh?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.144
But look at the panel
on the passenger side.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.754
Look what I did.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.235
Go ahead. Take a look.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.019
What?

13:23.150 --> 13:24.455
What is it?
What am I looking at?

13:24.586 --> 13:26.414
What--No, I'm saying
you got to have a look.

13:26.544 --> 13:27.850
Listen.

13:29.939 --> 13:32.899
This panel is actually
a secret compartment.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.380
Go on. Take a look.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.252
Fuck you.
I ain't going up there.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.427
Yeah, you are.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.211
- Ow!
- Jesus.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.953
Ow! You motherfucker!
Fucking cocksucker!

13:44.084 --> 13:46.260
I'll fucking kill you,
you motherfucker!

13:46.390 --> 13:48.958
Ow! Ow! What the fuck?!

13:49.089 --> 13:51.047
Yo, get the fuck off me!

13:51.178 --> 13:53.963
Get the fuck off me, cocksucker!

14:01.101 --> 14:03.146
Let me the fuck out of here!

14:03.277 --> 14:05.322
You're gonna die for this,
you cocksucker!

14:05.453 --> 14:09.109
Tell Chin I got his back
while he's away.

14:09.239 --> 14:12.329
You tell him I'll deal
with Bumpy fuckin' Johnson.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.592
What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

14:14.723 --> 14:17.857
What the fuck?! What the fuck?!

14:17.987 --> 14:20.598
What the fuck?! No!

14:20.729 --> 14:23.819
No!
Get me the fuck out of here!

14:33.307 --> 14:34.308
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.353
Step forward.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.442
He's good.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.618
I am grateful to your father
for protection,

14:40.749 --> 14:43.404
but sometimes,

14:43.534 --> 14:46.494
I fear these men
are overly zealous.

14:46.624 --> 14:50.106
I'm glad. You need them.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.152
I suppose.

14:54.023 --> 14:58.027
I feel like a hunted animal
these days.

14:58.158 --> 15:01.074
A man without a mosque
or a mission.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.120
The Nation of Islam isn't the
only mosque in New York City.

15:04.251 --> 15:08.081
No mosque will tolerate
my political opinions.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.909
Then start your own.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.215
That takes money.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.435
And followers.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.306
Neither of which I have.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.352
You have me.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.093
I'll help you.

15:20.223 --> 15:24.097
I'll organize. I'll raise money.
I'll do whatever it takes.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.580
I might take you up on that.

15:32.192 --> 15:35.108
Well, here I am
singing my own blues.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.241
How have you been?

15:38.372 --> 15:40.722
I'm fine.

15:43.507 --> 15:46.249
I'm still kicking myself
for trusting Omar.

15:46.380 --> 15:50.210
Jealousy and hate
clouded his mind.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.646
I almost married him.

15:53.561 --> 15:56.216
I feel foolish.

15:56.346 --> 15:59.567
It's so painful.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.529
I wish I could
take that pain away.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.231
He didn't deserve you.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.540
<i>With Chin up in Lewisburg,</i>

16:16.671 --> 16:18.368
<i>everything has gone to shit.</i>

16:18.499 --> 16:20.153
<i>What did that</i> strunze
<i>get sent up for?</i>

16:20.283 --> 16:22.459
<i>They fuckin' got him
poppin' his own associate,</i>

16:22.590 --> 16:25.332
<i>some fucko
named Ernie Nunzi.</i>

16:27.725 --> 16:29.640
That's Carlo Gambino

16:29.771 --> 16:31.773
discussing your father's arrest.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.731
Between that and
the disappearance of Joe Bonanno

16:33.862 --> 16:35.733
from New York,

16:35.864 --> 16:37.953
you have helped
throw the Five Families

16:38.084 --> 16:39.389
into total disarray.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.652
I hope they all
kill each other.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.654
I'd prefer
to see them in jail.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.446
What do you need me to do?

16:52.576 --> 16:55.710
I have to admit to being
a little surprised.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.104
Usually, a witness suffers

16:58.234 --> 17:00.367
from what we call
snitcher's remorse.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.631
My father was responsible

17:03.761 --> 17:06.025
for the death of three men
I loved.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.809
I can't wait
to take the stand.

17:09.637 --> 17:14.816
Well, Stella, that is what
I wanted to discuss today.

17:14.946 --> 17:17.036
I actually don't think
you taking the stand

17:17.166 --> 17:19.647
is going to be necessary.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.562
What are you
talking about?

17:21.692 --> 17:24.478
Your statements allowed us
to arrest him.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.828
Those are under seal.
If you took the stand,

17:26.958 --> 17:28.786
they would become
public knowledge,

17:28.917 --> 17:32.051
and you would be
in serious danger.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.705
I don't care.
I'm willing to take that risk.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.490
We're also concerned the jury
may not see you

17:36.620 --> 17:38.057
as a sympathetic witness

17:38.187 --> 17:41.495
if some of your personal choices
came to light.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.671
What do you mean?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.586
The defense will surely
bring up the fact

17:45.716 --> 17:48.197
that you had a relationship
with a Negro.

17:48.328 --> 17:51.287
That could
alienate the jury.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.376
Even when I tell them my father
was responsible

17:53.507 --> 17:55.204
for that man's death?

17:56.858 --> 17:58.729
Look, Stella,
I'm not saying

17:58.860 --> 18:00.601
I'll never call you
to the stand.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.342
It may be necessary.

18:02.472 --> 18:07.347
But if I can avoid it
and keep you safe, I will.

18:07.477 --> 18:09.175
You used me.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.571
We're both after
the same thing here--

18:14.702 --> 18:17.400
to make sure that your father
spends the rest of his life

18:17.531 --> 18:20.099
in the cold, dark cell
that he belongs.

18:20.229 --> 18:23.276
And when I get that conviction,
you and I

18:23.406 --> 18:25.452
and everyone in this office
will know

18:25.582 --> 18:28.716
that it was you
who slammed the door

18:28.846 --> 18:31.153
and threw away the key.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.862
It's totaled!

18:44.993 --> 18:46.734
Bumpy Johnson.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.476
How you doin'?
Joe Colombo.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.781
Hey.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.740
Nice suit. What is it?

18:52.870 --> 18:55.308
Orie's Custom Tailoring?
I get my suits made there, too.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.223
You buy your suits from
a black tailor on one-two-fifth?

18:57.353 --> 18:58.572
What?
Are you kidding me?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.443
Orie Walls
is a fuckin' genius.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.663
Last time I was there,

19:02.793 --> 19:04.230
Cassius Clay came in
to buy a few.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.840
He goes
by Muhammad Ali now.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.321
Oh, yeah.
I keep forgetting.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.585
I like Cassius better,
to be honest.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.369
Let's keep this short.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.328
The money
I owe the Families?

19:15.458 --> 19:17.634
Just know I'm good for it.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.636
I know. Don't worry.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.769
Come on,
let me show you around.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.859
So, I got guys lifting cars
all over the five boroughs.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.687
We break 'em down,

19:26.817 --> 19:27.775
resell the parts
all over the world.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.472
Mm-hmm.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.909
We also scout out new cars
and steal them on order.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.433
Look at this. You seen this?

19:33.563 --> 19:36.479
This new car Ford put out?
The Mustang?

19:36.610 --> 19:38.612
Fucking beautiful.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.527
Interesting.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.920
- You like espresso?
- Yeah, sure.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.358
Yeah? Come on.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.549
Okay.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.814
Doppio espresso
per voi due.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.512
<i>Grazie.</i>

20:13.516 --> 20:15.562
I'm good for a mill today.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.607
The rest will
take me some time.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.485
Well, who would have guessed
the dope would burn up?

20:27.661 --> 20:30.403
And don't worry
about the Families.

20:30.533 --> 20:34.537
Sure, they squawked at first,
but I got them in line.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.323
You're doing me favors.

20:37.453 --> 20:38.846
Why?

20:38.976 --> 20:42.241
Chin Gigante's in jail
without bond, as you know.

20:42.371 --> 20:45.592
I'm playing hall monitor
while he's gone.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.942
You can make up your debt
to the Families

20:48.072 --> 20:49.552
by working with me.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.814
What's the catch?

20:50.945 --> 20:54.035
No catch.

20:54.165 --> 20:57.212
Eh, those fossilized fucks
that run the Families--

20:57.343 --> 20:58.692
they got no respect
for who you are.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.650
But I do.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.609
You're a legend.

21:02.739 --> 21:05.046
<i>The</i> Bumpy Johnson.

21:05.176 --> 21:10.747
I appreciate the flattery,
but spell this shit out for me.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.358
What exactly do you want?

21:12.488 --> 21:14.751
We work together.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.710
On everything, alright?

21:16.840 --> 21:20.496
Narcotics, gambling, women.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.716
And you call
the shots, right?

21:24.892 --> 21:27.416
It's a partnership.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.375
It's pure business.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.900
And if I say no?

21:33.030 --> 21:35.468
Why would you do that?

21:35.598 --> 21:38.035
Because the last partnership
I had with one of you

21:38.166 --> 21:40.690
ended in blood...

21:40.821 --> 21:42.823
and flames.

21:42.953 --> 21:45.695
Either way, my people lose.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.575
Uh, think about it.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.492
Otherwise...

21:59.622 --> 22:01.450
the Families will need
to be paid in full by Friday.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.932
Your call.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.821
Thank you.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.693
Hey. How's everything?

22:26.823 --> 22:28.390
It's good?

22:28.521 --> 22:30.914
<i>Let us agree that the blow
must be struck,</i>

22:31.045 --> 22:33.917
<i>and let us agree what type
of blow must be struck</i>

22:34.048 --> 22:38.095
<i>and at whom the blow
should be struck,</i>

22:38.226 --> 22:40.794
<i>and then those who don't go
along with that strike,</i>

22:40.924 --> 22:42.361
<i>we need an organization...</i>

22:42.491 --> 22:43.492
- Hello.
<i>- ...that no one downtown loves.</i>

22:43.623 --> 22:45.059
You're on television.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.931
<i>We need one that's ready
and willing to take action,</i>

22:48.062 --> 22:49.890
<i>any kind of action.</i>

22:50.020 --> 22:54.068
<i>Not when the man downtown
sees fit, but when we see fit.</i>

22:54.198 --> 22:56.157
<i>By any means necessary.</i>

22:59.160 --> 23:02.903
Do you mind if we have a--
a few moments alone?

23:03.033 --> 23:05.862
I'm sorry, Minister Malcolm.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.864
Bumpy instructed me
to never leave this post.

23:16.873 --> 23:18.701
How much longer do you think
they're gonna have to be here?

23:18.832 --> 23:21.095
I don't know.

23:21.225 --> 23:24.054
We need Bumpy's help now.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.796
I'm not going to send
those gentlemen away.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.711
I miss our children.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.061
They're safe with Ella.

23:31.192 --> 23:36.458
It's a chance for them
to enjoy Boston.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.939
Maybe we can go
up there, too.

23:39.069 --> 23:43.552
We can stay in one of those
nice motels near your sister's.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.728
I'm needed here now.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.078
For what?

23:48.209 --> 23:53.693
We are three days out from
the worst riots since 1943.

23:53.823 --> 23:54.868
I need--

23:54.998 --> 23:56.130
You need to what?

23:56.260 --> 23:58.654
Go on to the television?

23:58.785 --> 24:01.396
Tell more things that might
aggravate people

24:01.527 --> 24:03.050
to try to kill you?

24:05.531 --> 24:06.967
I'm expected to be here.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.708
By who?

24:11.972 --> 24:13.626
Well, uh...

24:17.717 --> 24:19.109
You don't have to be
the version of you

24:19.240 --> 24:22.112
that's expected
by everyone else.

24:46.659 --> 24:47.834
You'll be happy to know

24:47.964 --> 24:50.227
Morgenthau doesn't need me
to testify.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.840
You're still a rat.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.146
The only reason you're here

24:56.277 --> 24:57.757
is because,
for some crazy reason,

24:57.887 --> 25:00.934
your father insisted
that I let you stay.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.632
If it was up to me,
you'd be out in the street.

25:03.763 --> 25:06.548
Well, I got an interview
with a job agency tomorrow.

25:06.679 --> 25:07.984
The minute I got
enough money saved,

25:08.115 --> 25:09.943
I'll be out of here forever.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.162
You, a job?

25:12.293 --> 25:13.990
You never worked a day
in your fucking life.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.514
Fuck you!

25:17.777 --> 25:20.170
Don't you talk like that
to me, you <i>puttana.</i>

25:20.301 --> 25:23.609
Your daddy's little girl act,
it don't work on me.

25:25.306 --> 25:28.048
You're a rat fink traitor.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.750
I feel sorry for you.

25:34.881 --> 25:37.231
It must be horrible
knowing your husband

25:37.361 --> 25:38.885
fucks all those goomahs

25:39.015 --> 25:40.843
because he finds you
so repulsive.

25:55.815 --> 25:58.252
Joe Colombo seems
different than the others.

25:58.382 --> 26:02.256
The terms of his deal
sound reasonable enough.

26:02.386 --> 26:05.041
Maybe even better than
what you had with Chin Gigante.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.174
The problem with Colombo
isn't the terms.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.958
I'm done shaking hands
with Italians.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.220
They can't be trusted.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.658
I get it.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.224
But the Ten Harlems
were all Black men,

26:14.355 --> 26:17.619
and they turned their backs
on you just the same.

26:17.750 --> 26:20.883
The Italians, they want
to keep me in shackles.

26:21.014 --> 26:23.843
To them, Harlem
is a cotton field,

26:23.973 --> 26:25.714
and I'm the house nigger.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.673
I didn't fight to keep
my wits in Alcatraz

26:27.803 --> 26:29.544
to come out and play
Stepin Fetchit.

26:29.675 --> 26:32.982
I want my plantation
out of escrow,

26:33.113 --> 26:34.375
my name on the deed

26:34.505 --> 26:36.377
so they can't shut
my lights off.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.074
You're either gonna work
with the Italians

26:38.205 --> 26:40.163
or you're gonna fight them.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.644
The safer choice is obvious.

26:43.993 --> 26:46.039
How much more do we need?

27:02.403 --> 27:04.231
Take them.

27:04.361 --> 27:06.407
All of them.

27:06.537 --> 27:10.411
It should get you
at least $50,000.

27:10.541 --> 27:14.763
That's 15 anniversaries'
worth of jewelry.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.330
I could never.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.942
I would pay any price
to keep you out of a coffin

27:20.073 --> 27:22.205
or another jail cell.

27:22.336 --> 27:25.252
I cost you enough, Mayme.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.908
This is my bill to pay.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.151
I'm proposing
a short-term bridge loan

27:55.282 --> 27:57.414
to be repaid within six months.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.329
And as collateral,

27:59.460 --> 28:01.331
I'm putting up the deed
to the Geechee.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.725
When I repay
my Italian investors,

28:03.856 --> 28:08.643
I'll resume my core businesses
and make up for the loss.

28:08.774 --> 28:12.168
Bumpy, surely
you can understand

28:12.299 --> 28:14.214
that we can't honor
that request.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.869
There was
a run on the bank.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.741
We're waiting on a Federal cash
infusion as we speak.

28:19.872 --> 28:23.136
Not to mention you already
owe us half a million dollars.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.747
Investing in your venture
was a terrible mistake.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.445
Charles, please.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.361
Venture?
Call it what it is, Judge.

28:31.492 --> 28:34.451
It was a heroin deal,
with all the inherent risks

28:34.582 --> 28:36.671
I explained to you
when you insisted

28:36.802 --> 28:38.455
that I allow you to invest.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.982
- You're bleeding us dry.
- Charles!

28:43.112 --> 28:46.986
No. I refuse to be intimidated
by this criminal.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.292
The tie pin,
the tailored suit--

28:49.423 --> 28:50.903
You can dress the part

28:51.033 --> 28:52.818
of a legitimate businessman, Johnson,

28:52.948 --> 28:57.387
but you're just a common,
everyday thief.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.872
If the cops came through
that door,

29:04.003 --> 29:06.875
we'd all go to jail
for the same crimes.

29:07.006 --> 29:10.139
Embezzlement, bank fraud,

29:10.270 --> 29:12.838
and heroin distribution.

29:15.405 --> 29:19.932
And if we end up in jail,
my esteemed brothers,

29:20.062 --> 29:24.110
trust me,
you'll want to be my friend.

29:34.511 --> 29:39.038
<i>I will remind you
that extremism</i>

29:39.168 --> 29:43.303
<i>in the defense of liberty
is no vice.</i>

29:43.433 --> 29:45.218
Roy, can you please
change the channel?

29:45.348 --> 29:47.176
I can't take this cracker
no more.

30:01.321 --> 30:03.453
Omar.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.978
I would understand
if you wanted

30:06.108 --> 30:08.415
to take me
to your father's men.

30:08.545 --> 30:11.026
In some respects,
I'd welcome it.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.506
What the hell are you
doing here?

30:12.636 --> 30:14.421
I want to apologize.

30:16.597 --> 30:19.513
To you.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.123
And to Malcolm.

30:21.254 --> 30:23.212
Get away from me.

30:23.343 --> 30:24.474
I spent
the last three days hiding,

30:24.605 --> 30:26.825
well aware that your father
wants me dead.

30:26.955 --> 30:29.088
He ain't the only one.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.916
Please, take me to Malcolm.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.396
At least let me make amends
to you both.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.137
He's surrounded by a dozen
of my father's men.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.270
They'll kill you on sight.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.446
And if that
is Allah's atonement for me,

30:39.576 --> 30:41.883
then I will accept it.

30:42.014 --> 30:44.190
I hope they shoot you.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.852
- I assume you can type.
- Yes.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.070
Words per minute?

30:55.201 --> 30:56.811
Thirty.
But I practice every day.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.205
- Shorthand?
- No.

30:59.335 --> 31:02.643
No shorthand. That rules out
secretarial work.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.514
With no experience, the kind
of jobs we're looking at

31:04.645 --> 31:08.083
are dishwasher,
domestic servant, housemaid.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.302
That's fine.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.912
It might require you

31:11.043 --> 31:12.566
to work alongside Negroes
and Hispanics.

31:12.696 --> 31:15.177
Some of our clients
have a problem with that.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.526
Not me.

31:20.443 --> 31:22.010
Are you married?

31:22.141 --> 31:23.446
I'm a widow.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.840
Do you have any children?

31:25.971 --> 31:27.015
No.

31:29.322 --> 31:33.195
So, getting a job is
very important for you

31:33.326 --> 31:35.023
during this difficult time.

31:35.154 --> 31:37.460
Absolutely.

31:37.591 --> 31:40.159
I'll guarantee you a job...

31:48.167 --> 31:49.690
if you give this a tug.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.047
I told you.

31:59.178 --> 32:02.398
I don't do shorthand.

32:02.529 --> 32:05.271
Do--Do you know what this is,
what you're talking about?

32:05.401 --> 32:06.881
Hey, guys, guys,
give us a break, alright?

32:07.012 --> 32:08.143
Go inside, please.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.711
We'll have a little
personal talk.

32:10.841 --> 32:13.366
Do me--Give me--
Give me five, alright?

32:14.019 --> 32:17.152
- Are you fucking crazy?
- No!

32:17.283 --> 32:18.588
You're one
of my oldest friends.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.243
I thought
I could count on you.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.072
Olympia, I cannot do that.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.988
Here, sit down, sit down.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.904
Tommy, I am begging you.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.080
Please.

32:32.211 --> 32:36.171
I told you. The answer is no.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.565
She put her
own father away, Tommy.

32:38.695 --> 32:41.089
Olympia, you should know

32:41.220 --> 32:42.743
we don't touch women
or children.

32:46.529 --> 32:50.098
She knows more than just
about the Genovese Family.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.621
What else does she know?

32:51.752 --> 32:53.319
She knows about
the Lucchese family, too.

32:53.449 --> 32:56.452
Listen to me. She knows
about your trucking business.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.106
Ohh.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.456
She knows about all
your airport hijackings.

33:00.587 --> 33:03.633
- Ohh.
- And a lot of other things, too.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.244
I don't know how she knows.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.376
Sniffing around,
I don't know, eavesdropping.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.464
She'll fucking rat.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.336
You know what?

33:10.466 --> 33:12.294
This is your husband Chin's
fucking problem.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.296
Why isn't he
taking care of it?

33:14.427 --> 33:18.126
He's in jail.
His calls are monitored.

33:18.257 --> 33:21.173
You don't think that he knows
she should go?

33:21.303 --> 33:24.350
Are you kidding me?
He just can't admit it.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.786
He's sentimental like that.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.483
What do you want me
to tell you?

33:27.614 --> 33:29.485
If he finds out
that I was involved

33:29.616 --> 33:31.661
with his daughter disappearing...

33:31.792 --> 33:33.141
We have a lot of secrets
from this man, Tommy.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.100
Let's face the facts.

33:37.798 --> 33:41.106
Who says he has to find out?

33:57.774 --> 33:59.646
Reverend Powell.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.126
I'm sorry I'm late.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.823
I was working
on Sunday's sermon.

34:02.953 --> 34:05.521
We need a good Word
right now.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.524
"The Negro in White America:

34:08.655 --> 34:10.526
Who Gets to Define Us?"

34:10.657 --> 34:13.355
The Lord Jesus
and our own damn selves.

34:13.486 --> 34:15.183
Well,
you'll just have to come

34:15.314 --> 34:16.445
to Sunday service to find out.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.537
Your husband home?

34:21.668 --> 34:24.018
- He stepped out.
- Oh.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.367
Did you tell him
about the position

34:25.498 --> 34:26.542
I'm offering you?

34:26.673 --> 34:28.544
Not yet.

34:28.675 --> 34:32.113
Well, don't wait for him to read
about it in the newspapers.

34:32.244 --> 34:36.422
I'm working on it. Ellsworth's
mind is otherwise occupied.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.685
Hmm. Do you mind if I make
myself a quick pick-me-up?

34:38.815 --> 34:42.167
Be my guest.

34:42.297 --> 34:46.258
As my right-hand executive
for Har-You,

34:46.388 --> 34:49.870
you will be responsible
for allocating government funds.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.611
I couldn't think of a better way
to rebuild Harlem

34:51.741 --> 34:54.570
after these riots.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.572
Thank you for trusting me, Reverend.

34:56.703 --> 34:59.445
Oh, of course. It's no favor.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.403
Your excellent work
as a volunteer

35:01.534 --> 35:03.318
has rightfully
earned you this position.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.321
- Oh, too early for me.
- Oh, well.

35:06.452 --> 35:09.237
In the spirits
of Regina Andrews, Ella Baker,

35:09.368 --> 35:12.893
and Lorraine Hansberry,
cheers to black women

35:13.023 --> 35:15.461
authoritatively kicking
some ass.

35:15.591 --> 35:20.161
Mm. Sister Suffrage does have
a--a nice ring to it.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.207
Mm.

35:22.337 --> 35:25.601
Which is why I don't want
your husband

35:25.732 --> 35:27.777
fucking up this opportunity.

35:27.908 --> 35:31.346
I'm warning you, Mayme,
for your sake and all of Harlem,

35:31.477 --> 35:33.870
implore Bumpy
to keep his nose clean.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.487
That's it?!
Twenty-four fuckin' grand?!

35:41.617 --> 35:44.316
Negroes was seein' us coming
and running the other way, boss.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.796
Not to mention the streets
are filled with riot cops.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.538
Yeah, making sure the white
man's stores don't get looted.

35:49.669 --> 35:51.149
I can't do shit with this!

35:51.279 --> 35:53.107
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

35:53.238 --> 35:54.282
This ain't our fault, man!

35:54.413 --> 35:55.805
What are you sayin'?
It's mine?

35:55.936 --> 35:57.764
You sayin' it's my fault?

35:57.894 --> 36:00.158
I'm sayin' people can't give
what they ain't got.

36:00.288 --> 36:01.811
Colombo wants full payment
by Friday.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.813
This is our last shot!

36:03.944 --> 36:05.337
Look, you always figure out
what to do, Bump.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.774
I got no fucking idea
what to do!

36:07.904 --> 36:10.646
Just let me--Just--

36:10.777 --> 36:13.562
Let me... think.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.262
Just think.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.396
This ain't you.
What's up, bro?

36:21.527 --> 36:23.790
What's eatin' at you?

36:26.706 --> 36:30.318
That duji...

36:30.449 --> 36:34.583
was the one chance I had
to control these blocks.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.331
Yeah?

36:49.816 --> 36:52.297
Send him up.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.735
Thank you
for giving me an audience.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.563
Of course.

36:57.693 --> 37:01.610
I understand you're a student
of history, just like me.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.873
- That so?
- Yeah.

37:04.004 --> 37:07.921
In fact, I know
that way back when,

37:08.051 --> 37:10.445
you protected the numbers bank

37:10.576 --> 37:13.013
of Stephanie Saint Clair
against Dutch Schultz.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.842
You got
a helluva backbone.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.626
What's that got to do
with anything?

37:17.757 --> 37:21.239
This isn't the old days.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.242
And we both know
there's no chance

37:24.372 --> 37:26.287
you're gonna have
$3 million by Friday.

37:26.418 --> 37:29.377
I thought my offer to partner
was a good one,

37:29.508 --> 37:33.251
but I guess you don't. Okay.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.775
So I'm gonna sweeten the pot.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.472
Oh, yeah?

37:37.603 --> 37:40.258
If you handle
our heroin distribution,

37:40.388 --> 37:42.738
I'll cut you in
on my car business.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.393
You steal 'em,
I'll chop 'em and sell 'em.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.352
A lot of money in it
for us both.

37:47.482 --> 37:49.310
I'm not your fucking
soldier, Colombo.

37:52.008 --> 37:54.924
I'm bending
over backwards here.

37:55.055 --> 37:58.493
What the fuck would it take?

37:58.624 --> 38:00.669
This ain't about you, Joe.

38:00.800 --> 38:05.631
You know, if I go south
of 110th Street,

38:05.761 --> 38:11.332
I gotta smile and bow and scrape
just like every other Negro.

38:11.463 --> 38:12.768
If I assert myself
to a white man

38:12.899 --> 38:14.770
in a way that he doesn't like,

38:14.901 --> 38:17.991
I get billy-clubbed
and I get put in jail.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.341
Does that happen to you
when you go downtown?

38:22.169 --> 38:25.912
But up here, it's different.

38:26.042 --> 38:30.743
Up here, I get respect.

38:32.222 --> 38:35.965
I call the shots.
Me and me alone.

38:38.968 --> 38:41.667
I can't share that

38:41.797 --> 38:44.017
because when it really
comes down to it,

38:44.147 --> 38:46.411
that's the only thing I got.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.805
So...

38:49.936 --> 38:54.027
your offer is generous
and respectful,

38:54.157 --> 38:57.335
and I appreciate it.

38:58.510 --> 39:02.470
But still,
I have to say no.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.128
I'm not like the others.

39:09.434 --> 39:13.046
I'm sorry, Joe. The answer's no.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.484
Okay.

39:18.530 --> 39:21.924
Then I withdraw my offer.

39:22.055 --> 39:24.536

41:40.715 --> 41:45.198

Captain Henry and I removed

you betrayed this woman,

41:55.817 --> 41:57.819
and you betrayed Islam.

41:57.950 --> 42:00.474

42:00.605 --> 42:03.825
You were my brother
for 15 years,

42:03.956 --> 42:06.001
and you tried to kill me.

42:08.656 --> 42:12.051
I lost the woman I love,

42:12.181 --> 42:13.705

42:13.835 --> 42:16.838
and the brother

42:16.969 --> 42:18.274
I don't deserve the breath

42:18.405 --> 42:21.321
You can take it if you wish.

42:21.451 --> 42:26.805
I just want your forgiveness
before I die.

42:26.935 --> 42:31.244
It's men like you
who'll someday get me killed.

42:31.374 --> 42:33.725

42:33.855 --> 42:38.730
I will have to pray to Allah
to open my heart to forgive.

I'd like to see you dead.

42:49.088 --> 42:51.960

42:55.747 --> 42:57.705
Well, hello, Bumpy.

42:57.836 --> 43:00.012
Reverend Powell.

43:03.363 --> 43:06.627
Good to see you.

43:06.758 --> 43:09.064
The Reverend has asked me
to oversee

43:09.195 --> 43:12.241
the Har-You program
as a deputy director.

43:12.372 --> 43:13.939
That's great.

43:14.069 --> 43:16.071
I can't think of anybody
better for the job.

43:16.202 --> 43:18.900
Thank you, darling.

43:19.031 --> 43:23.775
And as she will be assuming
a very public position,

43:23.905 --> 43:26.212
we'll all have to keep
on the straight and narrow now,

43:26.342 --> 43:27.953

Reverend Powell?

43:31.304 --> 43:33.611
Are you gonna have
to face jail time for that?

43:33.741 --> 43:36.091
Hung jury. Case dismissed.

43:36.222 --> 43:38.877
It's funny how the law never
seems to touch you politicians.

43:39.007 --> 43:40.052
Right?

43:40.182 --> 43:42.750
The Reverend was just telling me

43:42.881 --> 43:44.752
that he got government funding
for Harlem

43:44.883 --> 43:46.145
in light of the riots.

43:46.275 --> 43:49.714
I squeezed President Johnson
like a grapefruit.

43:49.844 --> 43:51.237
That's great.

43:51.367 --> 43:53.108

So, we gonna cut Reverend Powell
in on the score?

44:34.193 --> 44:35.629
What would he say if he knew

44:35.760 --> 44:37.022
he was the tipster
for a stickup?

44:37.152 --> 44:38.980
