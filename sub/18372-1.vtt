00:43.750 --> 00:46.566
Then sings my soul

00:46.666 --> 00:51.775
My saviour God, to thee

00:51.875 --> 00:55.900
How great thou art

00:56.000 --> 01:00.483
How great thou art

01:00.583 --> 01:04.066
Then sings my soul

01:04.166 --> 01:09.108
My saviour God, to thee

01:09.208 --> 01:13.150
How great thou art

01:13.250 --> 01:18.733
How great thou art

01:18.833 --> 01:22.733
When through the woods

01:22.833 --> 01:27.983
And forest glades I wander

01:28.083 --> 01:35.240
And hear the birds sing sweetly
in the trees

01:36.416 --> 01:39.691
When I look down

01:39.791 --> 01:45.108
From lofty mountain grandeur

01:45.208 --> 01:48.233
And hear the brook

01:48.333 --> 01:53.108
And feel the gentle breeze

01:53.208 --> 01:56.650
Then sings my soul

01:56.750 --> 02:01.691
My saviour God, to thee

02:01.791 --> 02:05.775
How great thou art

02:05.875 --> 02:09.941
How great thou art

02:10.041 --> 02:13.483
Then sings my soul

02:13.583 --> 02:18.525
My saviour God, to thee

02:18.625 --> 02:22.608
How great thou art

02:22.708 --> 02:28.358
How great thou art

02:28.458 --> 02:32.066
When Christ shall come

02:32.166 --> 02:36.900
With shouts of acclamation

02:37.000 --> 02:40.108
And take me home

02:40.208 --> 02:44.858
What joy shall fill my heart!

02:44.958 --> 02:52.074
Then I shall bow in humble adoration

02:52.541 --> 02:55.941
And there proclaim

02:56.041 --> 03:00.525
My God, how great thou art

03:00.625 --> 03:04.441
Then sings my soul

03:04.541 --> 03:08.074
My saviour God...

03:24.166 --> 03:26.858
Make the most of this beautiful train.

03:26.958 --> 03:29.740
That's it. Okay.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.108
Yeah.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.358
That's really great, yeah, yeah.

03:37.458 --> 03:40.650
Okay, now as I said before,
you're under no obligation to

03:40.750 --> 03:43.858
but you can if you want to,
give me a tiny little twinkle.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.358
Yeah, that is... Lovely.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.074
Great.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.615
A little bit closer.

03:49.958 --> 03:51.483
Now, don't you worry.
You'll be all right.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.782
There's just a little bit, that's it.

04:00.041 --> 04:02.816
And you've got an eyelash on your nose.
We don't want that, do we?

04:02.916 --> 04:05.408
It's supposed to be on your eye,
not on your snitch.

04:05.708 --> 04:08.775
That's it. You've got a lovely smile
when you smile, haven't you?

04:08.875 --> 04:10.358
Right, okay.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.525
Now, you keep that lovely
gorgeous smile.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.324
That's lovely.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.940
I think that'll do for the time being.

04:17.041 --> 04:19.409
Well done, Sarah.
That's the easy bit.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.108
They make a noise, don't they?

04:41.208 --> 04:43.608
At least they can play out around here.

04:43.708 --> 04:45.157
I suppose so.

04:49.875 --> 04:52.407
- What is it?
- Is that a suit?

04:53.041 --> 04:55.108
Well, it came as a combination.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.949
Do they go together?

04:57.333 --> 04:58.650
Well, if you think they do, they do

04:58.750 --> 05:00.316
and if you think they don't, they don't.

05:00.416 --> 05:01.949
It's nice.

05:07.208 --> 05:09.157
Twenty-one in August.

05:09.708 --> 05:11.358
She is.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.733
I used to worry meself sick
when she played out.

05:13.833 --> 05:16.566
She survived it though, didn't she?

05:16.666 --> 05:18.775
All things considering.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.441
She's back on the streets now.

05:20.541 --> 05:21.733
I beg your pardon?

05:21.833 --> 05:23.608
Well, she is, isn't she?

05:23.708 --> 05:25.699
I don't half-miss her.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.240
I know.

05:28.541 --> 05:30.949
How long is it since we've seen her?

05:31.375 --> 05:32.983
Two-and-a-half years.

05:36.208 --> 05:37.900
We could always ask her over.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.108
- I'd like to.
- For her birthday.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.108
It's only a couple of months away.

05:43.056 --> 05:44.782
What now?

05:45.208 --> 05:48.615
"Hey, Roxanne, what are you
doing for your 21 st?"

05:48.791 --> 05:52.525
"I'm goin' over to my auntie and
uncle's house for my birthday treat."

05:54.166 --> 05:55.699
It was only a suggestion.

05:55.958 --> 05:58.150
She's probably doing her own thing.

05:58.250 --> 06:02.324
I suppose we'd have to invite
Cynthia as well.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.858
There's no show without Punch.

06:04.958 --> 06:06.733
I'm sure she'd like to see the place.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.400
Oh, I'm sure she would.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.032
- She can't help it.
- Can't she?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.032
It's about time you showed it off.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.441
I mean, you've done a lovely job.

06:19.541 --> 06:21.365
I think so.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.816
I really must get down to see her.

06:29.916 --> 06:32.066
You speak to her
on the phone, don't you?

06:32.166 --> 06:34.657
It's not the same thing though, is it?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.615
She's your sister.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.365
I'm really proud of that portrait.

06:40.875 --> 06:44.115
I reckon that's the last time
she ever smiled.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.941
I dunno what's got into you lately.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.865
You complaining?

07:35.375 --> 07:37.233
- No.
- Well, shut up then.

07:37.333 --> 07:40.066
Sit here on me own for years on end.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.650
Can't get you to stop in at all.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.733
- And now you never go out.
- Leave it out.

07:43.833 --> 07:46.733
You've been sitting there for a month
with a face like a slapped arse.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.199
Well, what's there to smile about?

07:53.875 --> 07:56.191
I thought he might've phoned
at the weekend.

07:56.291 --> 07:57.949
Who?

07:58.208 --> 07:59.733
Who d'you think?

07:59.833 --> 08:01.483
I ain't heard from 'im for ages.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.566
- He's busy, ain't he?
- We're all busy.

08:03.666 --> 08:06.400
He's got his weddings and that.
It's the summer.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.025
Out of sight, out of mind.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.025
Well, if you're that bothered,
why don't you ring him yourself?

08:10.125 --> 08:11.191
He's your brother.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.782
I'm not running up me phone bill.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.699
He knows where I am if he wants me.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.108
He'd have had us up there to see it by now,
I expect, if it weren't for her.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.699
Toffee-nosed cow.

08:28.791 --> 08:31.740
What's he want with
six bedrooms, anyway?

08:43.666 --> 08:45.816
What's all your mates
doing tonight, then?

08:45.916 --> 08:48.365
I don't know. I ain't asked 'em.

08:50.958 --> 08:53.066
You wanna get yourself a bloke.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.608
That's what you wanna do.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.191
I've told you.
I don't wanna get anything.

08:56.291 --> 08:58.316
I'm quite happy here,
thank you very much.

08:58.416 --> 09:01.316
When I was your age,
I could've had the pick of the crop.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.066
Well, why didn't you?

09:03.166 --> 09:05.233
Because I lost my poor mother,
that's why.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.566
Oh, here we go.

09:06.666 --> 09:08.900
I was stuck at home here
from the age of 10,

09:09.000 --> 09:10.941
looking after Maurice and your granddad.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.775
Yeah, we know.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.400
Then I got saddled with you.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.691
That was my downfall, darling.

09:16.791 --> 09:18.608
I didn't ask to be born.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.525
No, and I never asked
to have you, neither.

09:20.625 --> 09:24.532
Well, you should've thought about that
before you dropped your knickers.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.150
With...

09:34.250 --> 09:35.650
Or without?

09:35.750 --> 09:36.941
I think without.

09:37.041 --> 09:39.199
- Without? Okay.
- Yeah.

09:40.625 --> 09:44.275
What about this one?
Better with or without?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.108
I think this time it's with.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.199
With? All right,
we'll pop this one in, then.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.941
I hear you're a really good runner.

09:53.041 --> 09:56.191
- Yeah. Cross-country.
- Have you won anything?

09:56.291 --> 09:58.483
Not yet. I've only just started.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.983
Okay, then. Look up again.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.358
Now, this is gonna blur a bit

10:02.458 --> 10:05.782
- but just tell me what you can read, okay?
- Yeah.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.949
H-L-A-C-T.

10:09.333 --> 10:12.025
- Right.
- And I can't read any more.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.740
Okay, that's good.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.574
Very good,
I'm gonna do your other eye now.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.775
- Are you off, then?
- Yeah.

10:29.875 --> 10:30.983
Got any plans for the weekend?

10:31.083 --> 10:33.441
Well, I've got to go to my mum's house
and sort through her things.

10:33.541 --> 10:34.900
- Oh, have you?
- Yeah.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.025
Hope it goes all right.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.691
- Well, it's gotta be done.
- Yeah.

10:37.791 --> 10:39.691
- Okay, then.
- Right, I'll see you on Monday.

10:39.791 --> 10:40.858
Yeah.

10:40.958 --> 10:43.025
- Have a nice weekend.
- Cheers.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.525
Ooh, enjoy the christening.

10:45.625 --> 10:48.199
- I'll try. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.358
It's 10 past.
We've got to pick Shelattica up.

11:33.458 --> 11:36.025
- What are you talking about?
- We've got 10 minutes.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.150
Listen, we've got to sort
this out while we're here.

11:38.250 --> 11:41.900
Look, basically, right, it's you, one, here,
in this massive house.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.691
- Thank you.
- This house is massive.

11:43.791 --> 11:45.441
We have got two children,
you understand?

11:45.541 --> 11:47.066
- And we could have more.
- What?

11:47.166 --> 11:48.858
We wanna have more.

11:48.958 --> 11:53.441
Listen, right, you can't stay here
on your own. It's not fair, is it?

11:53.541 --> 11:56.150
I mean, we can sell the house, can't we?
Sell the house and split the money.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.691
Listen, you know what? You could split
this whole house in two, right?

11:58.791 --> 12:01.400
You could split this into two flats
and it'd still be bigger than our place.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.525
- Split it in two?
- Exactly.

12:02.625 --> 12:03.608
You can't split it in two...

12:42.083 --> 12:44.150
Now, let's sort your tie out
for you, if I may.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.691
- Looks just a little bit skew-whiffy.
- Oh, skew-whiff again.

12:46.791 --> 12:47.983
Yes, that's lovely.

12:48.083 --> 12:49.941
- Do you want the paper out?
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

12:50.041 --> 12:55.025
You ladies look gorgeous.
Hands together there.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.400
Very nice, okay. Here we go.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.983
Put your paper down there.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.191
Right then, here we go. Okay, and...

13:01.291 --> 13:02.733
Do we say "cheese", Maurice?

13:02.833 --> 13:05.733
Well, you can if you like,
but you can, you can say "cheese".

13:05.833 --> 13:08.816
You can say whatever you like.
But just give me a little...

13:08.916 --> 13:09.983
That's it.

13:11.074 --> 13:12.858
Yeah, very sweet.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.400
Great, that's lovely.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.650
- So, that took you 15 years, yeah?
- Yes.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.150
- They give you a prize?
- No.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.607
Not even a stethoscope or something?
Lovely.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.191
Yeah, that's really lovely.
Come out, Jane.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.441
I'm so glad he's got his eyes open.

13:26.541 --> 13:28.525
That's it, yeah, that's it,
and give him a hand.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.657
Look down. Lovely.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.275
Are you gonna see that flea collar?

13:32.375 --> 13:34.150
- Are you going to see that?
- Don't worry about that.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.400
You come out now, come out.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.691
- You just come out the way.
- That's it.

13:37.791 --> 13:41.150
And pop out now.
And out, and here we go.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.150
I think you left the comb
in there that time.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.733
Lovely, very good.

13:44.833 --> 13:45.983
Oh, did he look good?

13:46.083 --> 13:47.983
- He does look good, yeah. So do you.
- Oh, good, yes.

13:48.083 --> 13:51.150
Thank you very much, Jane.
That's lovely.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.275
- It's for my auntie.
- Oh, right. Fond of you, is she?

13:53.375 --> 13:56.400
- No, she's in India.
- Oh, right.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.775
Time I got married, innit?

13:57.875 --> 14:02.025
Oh, I see. Pick a bride time, is it?

14:02.125 --> 14:03.608
I've told you, I don't want flash, it...

14:03.708 --> 14:05.316
Lovely!

14:08.375 --> 14:10.324
I never thought I'd have any...

14:10.708 --> 14:12.566
Fertility treatment.

14:12.666 --> 14:14.650
It's a miracle.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.400
Don't do that with your nose.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.191
Now stop it. Put it there. That's it.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.150
Hello, Dominic. Now look
at that lovely cat, look over there.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.775
- Look at that cat.
- He's lovely.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.650
- Oh, that's it, let him scratch it first.
- No!

14:24.750 --> 14:27.358
Go on, that's it, that's it.

14:27.458 --> 14:31.441
- Lovely!
- I feel so silly.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.441
A-ha, lovely and that's it.

14:33.541 --> 14:35.115
Thank you very much.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.858
- What d'you think you're doing?
- Sorry.

14:41.958 --> 14:43.025
Didn't you hear me?

14:43.125 --> 14:44.775
No, I didn't.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.358
- Hiya.
- What?

14:46.458 --> 14:48.824
- Hiya.
- Mind out of the way.

15:03.416 --> 15:05.858
- D'you want a drink?
- What?

15:05.958 --> 15:09.199
If I want a drink
I'll get it myself, thank you.

15:21.750 --> 15:25.615
Since when was hoovering
a spectator sport?

15:28.125 --> 15:29.525
Can I have a glass, too, please?

15:29.625 --> 15:30.941
I'm sorry, I thought
you didn't want a drink.

15:31.041 --> 15:32.275
I've changed my mind. I'm having milk.

15:32.375 --> 15:34.566
Not in a wine glass, give me a highball.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.691
- You don't put milk in a wine glass.
- There you go.

15:36.791 --> 15:38.941
- Thank you.
- That'll do you good.

15:39.041 --> 15:41.199
- Meaning?
- Nothing.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.824
- Had a good day?
- Scintillating.

15:48.291 --> 15:51.407
I suppose you'll be starving as usual.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.949
A little bit peckish, yeah.

15:55.958 --> 15:57.150
Do you want me to do something?

15:57.250 --> 15:59.191
- Like what?
- Anything you like.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.983
No, I bloody well wouldn't.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.865
- Fair enough.
- Oh, all right, then.

16:04.083 --> 16:07.865
There's the fridge, there's the freezer.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.691
There's the hob.

16:09.791 --> 16:11.191
There's the recipe books.

16:11.291 --> 16:12.990
Help yourself.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.615
And don't make a mess.

16:25.416 --> 16:27.782
Unless you fancy a takeaway.

16:37.041 --> 16:39.108
- You're not gonna smile, are you?
- No.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.941
Okay, it's a free world.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.483
Now, you're under no obligation,

16:42.583 --> 16:45.775
but you can if you want to
give me a lovely big smile.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.566
And thank you.

16:47.666 --> 16:50.525
Oh, go on. Come on. Lovely.

16:50.625 --> 16:53.608
You're under no obligation to me,
but you can smile if you like.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.400
Yeah, thank you.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.066
- Did you smile, Mother?
- No.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.639
That's it, to me. That's it,
now look at each other.

16:59.739 --> 17:02.691
That's it, it'll probably be all right.

17:02.791 --> 17:05.900
Go on, look up, keep your face up.
That's lovely.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.240
You're closing your eyes.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.025
Don't forget to burp it properly.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.157
Give it a drop of Gripe Water.

17:37.708 --> 17:40.657
We used to pour it down
Roxanne by the gallon.

17:43.416 --> 17:45.483
She farted like a trouper.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.157
Runs in the family.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.316
Would madame care
to test the temperature?

17:52.416 --> 17:54.740
I'm sure it'll be fine. Thanks.

18:02.666 --> 18:03.775
Been bad, has it?

18:03.875 --> 18:06.566
It eased off at lunchtime.

18:06.666 --> 18:08.775
I managed a couple of crackers.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.108
It's unpredictable, isn't it?

18:12.208 --> 18:14.441
No, it's not unpredictable.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.618
You've drawn the short straw, mate.

18:16.718 --> 18:21.115
You're telling me.
I wish it was unpredictable.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.025
What're you gonna have for your tea?

18:27.125 --> 18:29.025
Do you know what I really fancy?

18:29.125 --> 18:31.490
- What?
- A steak.

18:32.291 --> 18:34.900
You're not having
any steak in this house.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.316
Don't worry about me.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.566
You'll be keeling over
with a heart attack.

18:38.666 --> 18:42.532
- I'll do meself something later.
- There's a chicken Kiev in the freezer.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.316
Be a bit cold, wouldn't it?

18:46.182 --> 18:47.824
Anyway...

18:48.125 --> 18:50.199
I'm on a diet.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.525
You're disgusting.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.733
Okay, that's very good.
We can see the ring perfectly.

18:55.833 --> 18:59.066
All right now, sir,
if you just bring your chin up.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.650
Yeah, just slightly, that's perfect.
That's brilliant, all right, great.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.608
Sorry, sorry, listen,
take your glasses off.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.650
I don't want to take my glasses off.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.441
Go on, take them off.

19:08.541 --> 19:09.983
Doesn't matter.
Keep them on, take them off.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.865
- No, he looks better without them.
- It's what I look like, okay.

19:14.375 --> 19:15.566
Right, okay, and to me...

19:15.666 --> 19:17.941
One moment, please.
Can you take the cross out, please?

19:18.041 --> 19:19.525
Take the cross out.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.483
It's a gift, take it out.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.608
I just think it looks awful.

19:23.708 --> 19:24.733
It doesn't look awful.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.941
It looks awful, because it's not gold.
I told you, buy gold.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.066
Okay, right.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.400
Okay, and to me, yeah,
right, that's lovely.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.608
Now, do you want to look happy or sad?
I don't mind, whatever.

19:36.708 --> 19:40.657
And keep your...
And look at me. And lovely.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.990
Hello. My name's Hortense Cumberbatch.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.449
I got your letter. Hi.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.865
Oh, right. Tuesday.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.615
Hello?

20:40.958 --> 20:43.358
Hortense, hello. Jennie Ford.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.150
- Nice to meet you. Come this way.
- Oh, hi.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.983
- How are you? All right?
- Fine, thank you.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.441
- Good.
- I'm sorry about this prison cell.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.691
We've been banging on about it
for years, but there you go.

20:51.791 --> 20:54.025
Have a seat, make yourself at home.

20:56.916 --> 20:59.566
Now, before we go any further,
have you got any ID?

20:59.666 --> 21:02.032
- Passport, driving licence.
- Yeah.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.025
You'll have to get used to all this red tape.
Would you like a Rolo?

21:05.125 --> 21:07.282
- No, thank you. Yeah.
- Are you sure?

21:08.916 --> 21:10.650
There you go.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.699
Let's have a shifty.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.316
That's great. Hortense. Thank you.

21:17.416 --> 21:20.358
- Are you on your lunch break?
- Yeah, an extended one.

21:20.458 --> 21:21.900
- Have you had any lunch?
- No, not yet.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.733
No. Me, neither.

21:23.833 --> 21:26.150
- So, what do you do?
- I'm an optometrist.

21:26.250 --> 21:29.150
Oh, really? Oh, God.

21:29.250 --> 21:32.358
It's one of those things you keep
putting off and putting off, isn't it?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.400
And I've got to the stage now
with the Guardian crossword,

21:34.500 --> 21:37.150
where I'm going like this, so I think
the time has come, don't you?

21:37.250 --> 21:39.316
I'll have to pop in,
you can give me a test.

21:39.416 --> 21:40.941
- Where do you live?
- Kilburn.

21:41.041 --> 21:44.115
- Right, right, in a flat?
- Yes.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.441
- Do you share?
- No, I live on my own.

21:46.541 --> 21:48.324
Oh, right.

21:48.458 --> 21:50.066
I lived on my own.

21:50.166 --> 21:52.316
For about six years,
before I was married.

21:52.416 --> 21:54.275
It's all right, isn't it?

21:54.375 --> 21:56.490
Right, Hortense.

21:56.791 --> 21:58.941
Let's talk a little bit
about you, shall we?

21:59.041 --> 22:02.150
Now obviously you've been giving
a great deal of thought to things

22:02.250 --> 22:04.316
and you've come to a decision,
which is good.

22:04.416 --> 22:07.532
But for me, the question is, "Why now?"

22:09.416 --> 22:12.483
I just feel that it's
the right time, that's all.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.191
Right, right.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.608
- Are you thinking about getting married?
- No.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.316
- Do you have children?
- No.

22:18.416 --> 22:19.858
Are you thinking about having children?

22:19.958 --> 22:21.025
No.

22:21.125 --> 22:22.608
That's fair enough.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.483
Are you sharing this with your parents?

22:24.583 --> 22:26.358
Do they know that you're here today?

22:26.458 --> 22:28.108
How do they feel about it?

22:28.208 --> 22:30.358
They're both dead, actually.

22:30.458 --> 22:31.650
Oh, right.

22:31.750 --> 22:35.615
Yeah, Mum died two months ago now.

22:35.958 --> 22:38.990
Oh, that's recent.
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:39.208 --> 22:41.365
- Was it sudden?
- Yeah.

22:44.333 --> 22:47.108
Perhaps that's what's
made you start all this.

22:47.208 --> 22:48.691
I don't know.

22:48.791 --> 22:51.032
It's possible.

22:51.458 --> 22:54.233
Well, I'm not trying to replace her.
She's irreplaceable.

22:54.333 --> 22:57.782
- Well, they both are.
- No, of course, of course.

22:59.750 --> 23:02.441
And when you were growing up,
was it, was it a happy environment?

23:02.541 --> 23:04.400
- Yes, very.
- Oh, good, good.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.316
And did you...

23:06.416 --> 23:09.441
Were you able to discuss
the fact that you'd been...

23:09.541 --> 23:12.108
No, it was never really an issue.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.941
Right, right.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.400
So, you've only just found out?

23:15.500 --> 23:17.650
Oh, no, they told me when I was little.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.483
Oh, good, good. And do you
remember how you felt about that?

23:20.583 --> 23:22.400
Well, it's not exactly
something you forget, is it?

23:22.500 --> 23:25.532
No, no. I'm sure it isn't.

23:27.625 --> 23:29.782
So, how did you feel?

23:30.458 --> 23:33.858
Well, we all just got on
with it as a family.

23:33.958 --> 23:36.066
Do you know what I mean?

23:36.166 --> 23:38.074
Yeah.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.282
Perhaps you should've discussed it.

23:41.750 --> 23:46.699
My parents loved me and
that was all that matters, isn't it?

23:47.833 --> 23:49.657
Yeah, yeah.

23:50.791 --> 23:54.782
So, now that we've got you here,
what are your expectations?

23:55.916 --> 24:00.115
Basically, I just want to know.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.365
Yeah, yeah, of course, you do.

24:04.125 --> 24:06.699
Let me share something
with you, Hortense.

24:08.291 --> 24:12.566
Somewhere out there, and we don't know
where, is your birth mother...

24:12.666 --> 24:16.115
Now, she's probably married.
Perhaps not.

24:16.666 --> 24:20.316
She may have other children.
She might be dead.

24:20.416 --> 24:23.025
She may even be in Australia or somewhere.
We just don't know.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.691
But what we do know is...

24:24.791 --> 24:27.108
That at the time she
gave you up for adoption,

24:27.208 --> 24:31.275
she was under the impression that she
would probably never see you again.

24:31.375 --> 24:35.358
Now, as I know you're very well aware,
the law has changed since then...

24:35.458 --> 24:38.900
And you are now legally entitled
to seek your birth mother out.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.907
But the snag is...

24:41.875 --> 24:44.324
She might not want to see you.

24:47.625 --> 24:50.816
So, I don't want you to raise
your hopes too high at this stage.

24:50.916 --> 24:53.199
- Sure.
- Okay?

24:53.750 --> 24:55.365
Have a look at this.

24:56.041 --> 24:57.949
What is it?

24:58.208 --> 25:00.115
It's all about you.

25:04.750 --> 25:07.490
I'll tell you what.

25:07.750 --> 25:08.775
I'll leave it with you

25:08.875 --> 25:10.816
- and I'll pop back in a few minutes.
- Yeah.

25:10.916 --> 25:13.782
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

26:25.291 --> 26:27.699
How are you doing? All right?

26:36.458 --> 26:37.990
Thank you.

26:48.166 --> 26:52.115
Cynthia Rose Purley, that's her?

26:54.625 --> 26:56.733
Cynthia Rose.

26:56.833 --> 26:59.282
It's a nice name, isn't it?

27:00.375 --> 27:03.199
That's her signature?

27:04.208 --> 27:06.115
That feel strange?

27:09.625 --> 27:12.615
Elizabeth, that's my middle name.

27:12.833 --> 27:14.733
They must have kept it.

27:14.833 --> 27:19.449
Well, that would be your birth name, you see?
Elizabeth Purley.

27:27.041 --> 27:30.441
Listen, is there any way
I could get a copy of these?

27:30.541 --> 27:33.400
No, those are the originals
and they're yours to keep.

27:33.500 --> 27:37.532
That's your right under the 1975 Act.
I've made copies upstairs.

27:42.333 --> 27:45.990
Shall I pop those in here for you?

27:47.875 --> 27:49.574
So...

27:50.750 --> 27:54.490
What we need to do now is...

27:55.958 --> 27:59.157
You go away and have a think.

28:00.708 --> 28:04.733
And, when the time's right, and not before,
you know, it's very much in your own time,

28:04.833 --> 28:10.365
come back to me if that's what you want.
And we'll get the ball rolling.

28:11.500 --> 28:16.441
Now it can be a very long-winded process
and there's no two ways about it.

28:16.541 --> 28:19.532
It's a very traumatic journey
we're embarking on.

28:20.125 --> 28:25.074
And there may be other
people's feelings to consider, too.

28:26.416 --> 28:28.824
So, I'll wait to hear from you. Okay?

28:31.166 --> 28:35.900
You, you could decide
to trace your birth mother by yourself,

28:36.000 --> 28:37.983
if you wanted, but I wouldn't advise it.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.775
We're a professional service.

28:39.875 --> 28:42.365
And we know how to handle these things.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.615
So, I think you should
take advantage of us.

28:56.375 --> 28:58.358
- Hello.
- Oh, you're back, hello.

28:58.458 --> 29:00.066
- I think I've found a mistake.
- I'm sorry, Hortense,

29:00.166 --> 29:02.275
- I can't stop. I'm really in a hurry.
- Look, it says she's white.

29:02.375 --> 29:03.483
Sorry?

29:03.583 --> 29:05.108
"Mother, white".

29:05.208 --> 29:08.907
Well, it's perfectly feasible
that your mother was white, isn't it?

29:10.333 --> 29:12.275
Look, I'm, I'm sorry, Hortense,
really, I've got to go.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.691
I'm on an emergency case.

29:13.791 --> 29:16.282
Yes, but could this be a mistake?

29:16.625 --> 29:18.858
I very much doubt it.

29:18.958 --> 29:23.949
Look, give me a ring in the morning,
and we'll have a talk then. Okay, I'm sorry.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.608
Look at that.

29:31.708 --> 29:34.275
- Legs like a teenager!
- Do you have to?

29:34.375 --> 29:37.608
- You'd like a pair like that.
- What for?

29:37.708 --> 29:39.865
I'm known for my legs.

29:40.208 --> 29:42.650
If you got it, flaunt it.

29:42.750 --> 29:43.775
Are you going out?

29:43.875 --> 29:45.615
'Course I ain't.

29:47.791 --> 29:49.025
Who's that?

29:49.125 --> 29:51.074
I don't know.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.400
If it's what's-her-name
you could ask her to come in.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.699
I don't even know who it is yet.

29:59.250 --> 30:01.150
What are you doing here?

30:01.250 --> 30:03.150
Just come to see you.

30:03.250 --> 30:05.074
Well, you can't come in, my mum's here.

30:05.458 --> 30:08.074
- Who is it?
- I'm going out.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.949
Hello.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.858
You all right, sweetheart?

30:16.958 --> 30:18.949
Would you get inside?

30:31.416 --> 30:33.990
- Nothing's changed much.
- No.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.074
Ain't your mum been
round looking after you?

30:37.333 --> 30:39.775
She came round Sunday after mass.

30:39.875 --> 30:41.525
Didn't take you long
to mess it up again.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.233
She's laying off me a bit now, though.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.900
- I should think so too at your age.
- Yeah.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.157
She should have a word with my mum.

30:48.666 --> 30:50.657
I'll bet she misses you, though.

30:51.583 --> 30:55.733
Fucking do without it altogether,
I tell you.

30:55.833 --> 30:57.566
Yeah, I know what you mean.

30:57.666 --> 31:00.449
You and me, mate,
we're better off without them.

31:02.708 --> 31:07.316
Look, I'm sorry about, you know?

31:07.416 --> 31:09.449
So you should be.

31:11.833 --> 31:13.650
Don't get all serious on me, Paul.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.657
- No, no, I ain't.
- Yes, you are, you fool.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.574
Just missed you.

31:20.833 --> 31:22.657
How much?

31:23.125 --> 31:24.316
A lot.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.199
- Just a lot?
- No... Yeah.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.907
Well, I might've missed you a bit.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.900
No. I've been going outta me head.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.199
Same as that.

31:53.083 --> 31:57.483
Just so's you know, I ain't staying the night,
not every time I come round.

31:57.583 --> 32:02.191
And I weren't in a strop before.
I was just speakin' my mind, all right?

32:02.291 --> 32:04.199
Now give us a snog.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.150
- Hello. Good afternoon.
- Hello.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.358
Thank you very much indeed.
Right, that's fine.

34:05.458 --> 34:07.816
- Is that a post or collect?
- Collect, please.

34:07.916 --> 34:09.983
Thanks very much.
That's £6, please, madam.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.614
£6, okay.

34:25.708 --> 34:27.275
I saw her, you know.

34:27.375 --> 34:29.364
- Did ya?
- Yeah.

34:29.791 --> 34:33.150
8:00 in the morning, she's down Harlesden
buying her yam and banana...

34:33.250 --> 34:35.690
And she's like,
"You got a boyfriend yet, Dionne?"

34:36.875 --> 34:39.690
Nearly everyone who went to
the funeral reckoned they'd seen her

34:39.791 --> 34:42.108
and she'd given them some kinda sign.

34:42.208 --> 34:44.940
"Me see you mother
two days before she dead.

34:45.041 --> 34:49.608
"And she hold onto me hand
and look in me eye, as if she did know."

34:55.000 --> 34:58.615
I mean, if she knew,
I wish she'd told us.

34:59.708 --> 35:01.615
You're getting better, though.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.740
It's a nice day.

35:05.958 --> 35:07.824
Yeah.

35:11.791 --> 35:15.150
I dunno, my head can't contain it all.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.191
It's too soon.

35:18.958 --> 35:21.615
There's nothing rational about grief.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.074
Maybe you're crying for yourself.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.157
- You been out much?
- No, I can't.

35:31.125 --> 35:34.949
Some days I'm completely vulnerable.

35:35.083 --> 35:37.150
I can feel everything.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.566
Other days I'm numb.

35:39.666 --> 35:42.074
- Well d'you want to come out with me?
- No.

35:44.208 --> 35:47.157
- I got stuff to sort out.
- What?

35:47.916 --> 35:49.740
Life.

35:51.791 --> 35:53.150
Look, if there's anything I can do...

35:53.250 --> 35:57.324
No, thanks, I'll be all right.

35:58.333 --> 35:59.483
Have you heard from Bernard?

35:59.583 --> 36:00.900
No.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.199
Yes.

36:03.041 --> 36:04.733
He sent a sympathy card.

36:05.916 --> 36:07.782
Which I thought was
a very nice thing to do.

36:15.291 --> 36:16.733
I did something really bad.

36:16.833 --> 36:19.650
Oh, no, I don't think
I can deal with no confession.

36:19.750 --> 36:21.108
Cleanse my soul.

36:21.208 --> 36:22.733
I did the do.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.025
- Do it.
- Did the deed.

36:25.125 --> 36:27.108
- Did it.
- With a complete stranger.

36:27.208 --> 36:29.233
- No, who?
- Dunno.

36:29.333 --> 36:30.941
Well, what'd he look like?

36:31.041 --> 36:33.108
Dunno. He was in advertising.

36:33.208 --> 36:35.316
Oh, Lord!

36:36.833 --> 36:39.275
- Did you use a condom?
- Yes.

36:39.375 --> 36:41.566
Did you use two?

36:41.666 --> 36:42.900
Yes.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.566
One on top of the other?

36:44.666 --> 36:46.025
One after the other.

36:46.125 --> 36:48.152
Oh, God!

36:48.825 --> 36:50.865
Do you despair of me?

36:51.166 --> 36:53.025
- No.
- Yes, you do.

36:53.125 --> 36:55.733
I don't. Did you have a good time?

36:55.833 --> 36:57.066
Yeah.

36:57.166 --> 36:59.657
- That's all that matters then, innit?
- Yeah.

37:03.625 --> 37:07.025
I liked my mum as a person,
but I didn't know her.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.775
I wish I'd known her.

37:08.875 --> 37:10.483
She loved you.

37:10.583 --> 37:12.907
Yeah, I know,
but that's not in debate, is it?

37:14.708 --> 37:17.949
My mum, she resents me.

37:18.416 --> 37:20.240
She kept you.

37:21.708 --> 37:24.240
She fed you, and she clothed you.

37:25.083 --> 37:29.483
She didn't give you away. She could've.

37:29.583 --> 37:32.032
- I wish she had.
- No, you don't.

37:35.541 --> 37:37.949
The thing is they're so secretive.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.233
It's that "back home" thing, you know.

37:40.333 --> 37:42.483
Come out, big people are talking.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.574
That sort of vibe.

37:44.875 --> 37:49.191
So, you don't pursue things
because you're brought up not to.

37:49.291 --> 37:51.740
I just let 'em get on with it.

37:55.166 --> 37:59.691
All I seem to do is think about
things I wish I could've asked her.

37:59.791 --> 38:01.324
Like what?

38:04.166 --> 38:05.615
I dunno.

38:07.166 --> 38:09.233
There's stuff I wish I knew.

38:09.333 --> 38:11.782
- There's stuff I wish I didn't know.
- No.

38:13.708 --> 38:17.066
If you knew you had a limited
amount of time, you'd sort it out.

38:17.166 --> 38:19.691
You'd ask your mum questions

38:19.791 --> 38:22.316
regardless of whether she got vexed.

38:22.416 --> 38:26.824
Like, I don't know. What happened
between her and your dad, for example.

38:26.958 --> 38:28.191
No.

38:28.291 --> 38:31.858
She hasn't made no effort for me,
so why should I be interested in her?

38:31.958 --> 38:34.108
And where's my dad, anyway?

38:34.208 --> 38:36.650
I don't want to hear her
and Norbert having it off.

38:36.750 --> 38:39.358
I don't want her to know
who I'm having it off with.

38:39.458 --> 38:41.775
And I don't want her to see me drunk.

38:41.875 --> 38:44.115
I don't want her to know
nothing about me.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.566
Maybe that's because you're
frightened that

38:46.666 --> 38:49.775
when you look at her
you can see yourself in 20 years' time.

38:49.875 --> 38:51.358
Please.

38:51.458 --> 38:53.365
We choose our parents.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.983
How do you mean?

38:56.083 --> 38:58.733
We choose the parents in this life,

38:58.833 --> 39:00.816
that can teach us something.

39:00.916 --> 39:04.240
So, that when we go
into the next life we get it right.

39:07.250 --> 39:10.365
'Course, sometimes it
don't work, does it?

39:15.416 --> 39:17.108
I'm gonna pop out for a couple of hours.

39:17.208 --> 39:19.400
- What time will you be back?
- 4:30.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.824
- Okay, have fun.
- Thanks.

39:23.916 --> 39:26.525
Sorry to interrupt. Could you get me
a few of these things in?

39:26.625 --> 39:28.650
- Right.
- I'm a bit low.

39:28.750 --> 39:30.407
I'll give them a ring.

40:14.125 --> 40:15.824
17.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.400
Hello.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.365
Bloody hell!

41:23.250 --> 41:24.775
What you doing here?

41:24.875 --> 41:26.324
Thought I'd come and see you.

41:26.833 --> 41:28.324
Where's Monica?

41:29.916 --> 41:32.003
She's at home, I think.

41:33.098 --> 41:36.115
- You gonna let me in then?
- Yeah, of course.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.275
D'you want a cup of tea?

41:42.375 --> 41:43.740
Yes, please.

41:46.916 --> 41:48.108
You all right, then?

41:48.208 --> 41:49.532
Smashing.

41:50.291 --> 41:51.900
You been working down this way?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.740
Yeah, round the back of Tower Bridge.

41:54.916 --> 41:57.691
If I'd known you was comin'
I'd have warmed up the seat.

41:57.791 --> 41:59.490
Warm enough, I should think.

42:08.708 --> 42:11.199
Does Monica know you've come round here?

42:11.458 --> 42:13.532
No. I didn't know I was comin' meself.

42:14.791 --> 42:16.191
She's okay, then?

42:16.291 --> 42:17.824
Yeah, she's fine.

42:19.875 --> 42:21.449
Been busy with the house.

42:22.333 --> 42:23.865
What doing?

42:24.041 --> 42:26.733
I thought it was supposed
to be a new house, you said.

42:26.833 --> 42:28.324
Stencilling.

42:28.916 --> 42:30.275
What, drawing?

42:30.375 --> 42:31.740
No.

42:32.333 --> 42:33.990
Stencils. On the wall.

42:34.625 --> 42:37.699
Decorating.
You must've seen it in magazines.

42:38.875 --> 42:40.324
It's very effective.

42:44.333 --> 42:46.032
Roxanne not in, then?

42:47.625 --> 42:49.733
She's got some bloke in tow.

42:49.833 --> 42:50.983
Has she?

42:51.083 --> 42:52.983
Shifty-lookin' bleeder.

42:53.083 --> 42:55.330
Walks like a crab.

42:55.430 --> 42:57.233
- Your tea's there.
- Ta.

42:57.333 --> 42:58.733
D'you want a sandwich?

42:58.833 --> 43:00.282
No, thanks.

43:00.500 --> 43:01.566
Is that all you're havin'?

43:01.666 --> 43:03.525
I only see her first thing
in the morning.

43:03.625 --> 43:06.407
She comes in, grunts,
then buggers off to work.

43:06.791 --> 43:08.407
You should be glad she's got a fella.

43:08.625 --> 43:10.191
I am glad, Maurice.

43:10.291 --> 43:11.782
I want her to be happy.

43:12.625 --> 43:16.025
But I'd like her to bring him round,
see who she's knocking about with.

43:16.125 --> 43:17.275
Just give her a bit of time.

43:17.375 --> 43:19.449
You used to bring your girlfriends home.

43:19.666 --> 43:22.199
Front of the telly. Laugh, drink.

43:22.750 --> 43:24.824
You didn't mind me
sittin' there, did you?

43:26.541 --> 43:29.199
What's her name? Never stopped talkin'.

43:29.375 --> 43:30.990
- Tina.
- Tina.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.865
Then the other one wouldn't
open her mouth.

43:36.250 --> 43:38.108
- Maxine.
- That's it.

43:38.208 --> 43:40.115
Dad liked her, didn't he?

43:41.291 --> 43:42.949
Nice thighs.

43:44.666 --> 43:46.240
So, how's work, then?

43:48.500 --> 43:50.740
- Still at the same place?
- Yeah.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.525
I gotta get her something
for her birthday.

43:53.625 --> 43:55.275
It's her 21 st, Maurice.

43:55.375 --> 43:57.740
- August the 7th.
- I dunno what she wants.

43:58.833 --> 44:00.441
Apart from me under a bus.

44:00.541 --> 44:01.775
That's silly talk.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.282
Me head in the oven.

44:05.083 --> 44:06.865
When are you gonna come
and see us, then?

44:08.625 --> 44:10.324
You know, have a bit of a get-together.

44:10.791 --> 44:12.816
Come on Roxanne's birthday.
We'll have some champagne.

44:12.916 --> 44:14.191
What about Monica?

44:14.291 --> 44:16.066
Yeah. She'll be there.

44:16.166 --> 44:18.032
Won't she mind?

44:18.916 --> 44:21.941
No, it was her idea, actually.

44:23.583 --> 44:26.316
- How'd you fancy a barbecue?
- If you like.

44:26.416 --> 44:28.324
Anyway, it's about time
you saw the house.

44:28.625 --> 44:29.941
Thought you was never going to ask.

44:30.041 --> 44:32.775
- Well, I'm asking you now.
- You been there nearly a twelvemonth.

44:32.875 --> 44:34.525
Tell Roxanne.

44:34.625 --> 44:36.240
She might not want to come.

44:36.625 --> 44:38.733
She'll say no just to spite me.

44:38.833 --> 44:41.608
Yeah, well, I demand her presence.
Tell her.

44:41.708 --> 44:43.240
What if she wants to bring him?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.400
Has he got a job, this bloke?

44:47.500 --> 44:50.199
- Scaffolding, she says.
- Oh.

44:51.666 --> 44:53.157
It's very well paid.

44:53.916 --> 44:55.990
- Is it?
- Yeah.

45:00.791 --> 45:02.490
21.

45:04.416 --> 45:06.532
I can't believe it, Maurice.

45:07.166 --> 45:10.365
I was carrying her
when I was 21, wasn't I?

45:13.666 --> 45:15.275
You was good with nappies.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.066
Those safety pins, though.

45:19.166 --> 45:20.983
Never stabbed her though,
did you, darling?

45:21.083 --> 45:22.733
Stabbed meself a couple of times.

45:22.833 --> 45:24.615
17, weren't you?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.324
I was.

45:59.375 --> 46:01.074
Place is still standing, then?

46:01.583 --> 46:04.733
Not for much longer.
You should see Dad's room.

46:04.833 --> 46:05.858
What's up with it?

46:05.958 --> 46:07.983
It's like the Niagara Falls up there.

46:08.083 --> 46:10.324
- What's it got, a leak?
- Yeah.

46:10.791 --> 46:12.449
Only when it's raining.

46:13.333 --> 46:14.865
I'll have a look.

46:18.416 --> 46:20.907
Nice to have a man about the place.

46:25.583 --> 46:28.074
I wish I'd known you was coming.

46:39.166 --> 46:40.865
It's dry at the moment.

46:41.333 --> 46:43.657
The whole lot's gonna come down.

46:45.958 --> 46:49.199
Yeah, it does look a bit dodgy,
I'll have to admit.

46:50.291 --> 46:52.441
- Are you up to date on the rent?
- 'Course I am.

46:52.541 --> 46:54.316
Well, give him a ring.
Get him to do something about it.

46:54.416 --> 46:56.441
- It's his responsibility.
- Don't be daft, Maurice.

46:56.541 --> 46:58.900
He don't give a toss, does he?

46:59.000 --> 47:00.650
Well, get someone to look at it.

47:00.750 --> 47:02.282
I'll pay.

47:06.125 --> 47:07.824
Look at all this junk!

47:09.583 --> 47:11.199
What're you gonna do with it?

47:19.250 --> 47:21.574
Give us a cuddle, Maurice.

47:24.041 --> 47:26.400
Please, sweetheart.

47:34.166 --> 47:38.574
Why have you left it so bloody long?

47:40.875 --> 47:42.949
Well, you know, it's, it's work and...

47:43.458 --> 47:46.900
Well, there's nothing the matter
with your dialling finger.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.025
Well, you can ring me.

47:49.125 --> 47:51.615
You're always too busy, ain't ya?

47:56.708 --> 47:58.608
Look, look...

47:58.708 --> 48:00.358
Look, sit, sit yourself down.

48:00.458 --> 48:03.490
You're the only one I've got, Maurice.

48:09.750 --> 48:12.074
You love me, don't you?

48:14.916 --> 48:18.615
Hold me tight, Maurice, please.

48:21.208 --> 48:25.615
Sweetheart.

48:51.458 --> 48:53.115
My little brother.

48:57.291 --> 48:59.074
Look at you.

49:01.583 --> 49:03.740
That's the good life for you.

49:11.291 --> 49:13.199
When are you gonna shave?

49:15.125 --> 49:17.115
Slap your arse.

49:25.958 --> 49:27.949
Why don't you chuck it all out?

49:30.541 --> 49:32.240
I mean, look at it.

49:36.916 --> 49:39.733
Some of it hasn't been touched
since Mum died.

49:39.833 --> 49:42.740
Can you use anything, Maurice,
in your new house?

49:44.041 --> 49:45.574
Fill a space?

49:46.750 --> 49:48.199
No, thanks.

49:49.666 --> 49:51.490
Thought I might move in 'ere.

49:52.041 --> 49:53.657
Front view.

49:54.125 --> 49:56.032
See the world go by.

50:03.875 --> 50:05.574
Remember this?

50:09.791 --> 50:10.990
Yeah.

50:11.500 --> 50:13.824
That's no use to you, is it?

50:14.125 --> 50:15.699
I don't think so.

50:16.833 --> 50:20.240
You ain't gonna
make me an auntie now, are you?

50:21.500 --> 50:23.115
Sweetheart.

50:30.250 --> 50:31.907
Listen, Cynth...

50:43.166 --> 50:45.074
I'd better... Better be going.

50:58.333 --> 51:01.191
You'll let me know about the barbecue, then,
will you, sweetheart?

51:01.291 --> 51:02.441
Yeah, of course I will.

51:02.541 --> 51:04.358
Tell her, if she can't make it,
I'll give her a clump.

51:04.458 --> 51:06.233
Yeah, not before I do.

51:06.333 --> 51:07.657
Hang on.

51:14.750 --> 51:16.483
Shall I say hello to Monica for you?

51:16.583 --> 51:18.782
If you like, sweetheart.

51:20.625 --> 51:22.740
- There you go.
- Thanks, darling.

51:27.875 --> 51:29.025
See you.

51:29.125 --> 51:30.365
Ta-ta.

51:55.916 --> 51:57.949
What was your Mum like
when your dad died?

51:58.916 --> 52:00.191
What do you mean?

52:00.291 --> 52:01.441
How did she cope?

52:01.541 --> 52:02.949
I don't know.

52:03.166 --> 52:04.824
Too young to remember.

52:06.541 --> 52:09.199
She just got on with it, I suppose,
like everybody else.

52:09.791 --> 52:11.365
Did you have to look after Craig?

52:12.541 --> 52:15.449
What, you mean
like your big sister looked after you?

52:15.916 --> 52:17.532
No, I did not.

52:20.750 --> 52:23.490
My dad never said a word
about my mum after she died.

52:23.916 --> 52:25.615
That's men for you.

52:25.833 --> 52:27.407
I hated him for it.

52:30.541 --> 52:32.740
He must've been in real pain.

52:36.250 --> 52:38.074
Maybe he just couldn't share it.

52:44.208 --> 52:45.990
I didn't know what I felt.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.240
I still don't.

52:55.041 --> 52:58.324
Cynthia's antics
couldn't have helped him much.

53:01.041 --> 53:02.490
Do you miss Craig?

53:02.791 --> 53:03.941
Why would I miss Craig?

53:04.041 --> 53:05.108
Well, he's your brother.

53:05.208 --> 53:07.699
- He's in Saudi Arabia, isn't he?
- Yeah.

53:10.750 --> 53:13.282
Well, I don't exactly miss him.

53:15.708 --> 53:18.157
Why? Do you miss Cynthia?

53:23.250 --> 53:26.316
Do you think Roxanne's serious
about this scaffolder bloke?

53:26.416 --> 53:28.233
Oh, she's only known him
for five minutes.

53:28.333 --> 53:31.240
Mind you, I was married
at her age, wasn't I?

53:32.500 --> 53:33.775
Yeah.

53:33.875 --> 53:35.525
I wonder if she knows.

53:35.625 --> 53:37.032
What, about us?

53:38.083 --> 53:40.025
What is there to know about us?

53:40.125 --> 53:41.699
You know what I mean.

53:44.916 --> 53:47.441
How would she know about that
unless you've told her.

53:47.541 --> 53:48.865
I haven't told her.

53:49.125 --> 53:50.775
I hope Cynthia doesn't know, either.

53:50.875 --> 53:52.191
She doesn't.

53:52.291 --> 53:53.782
That's all right then.

53:57.291 --> 54:00.358
No, I meant, if she knows about Cynthia.

54:00.458 --> 54:02.400
Y'know, before she was born.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.949
I don't know.

54:05.916 --> 54:06.858
I don't know.

54:06.958 --> 54:09.525
I mean, she's got a half-brother or
half-sister knocking about somewhere.

54:09.625 --> 54:10.816
She's got a right to know.

54:10.916 --> 54:12.407
That's up to Cynthia.

54:14.541 --> 54:16.115
You'd never say anything, would you?

54:18.416 --> 54:19.858
Of course not.

54:19.958 --> 54:21.157
Good.

54:22.958 --> 54:24.615
Anyway, she must've told her.

54:25.750 --> 54:27.782
She never told her who her father was.

54:28.208 --> 54:29.907
None of us knew who he was.

54:32.083 --> 54:33.483
I wonder if she ever misses him.

54:33.583 --> 54:35.324
- Who?
- Roxanne.

54:35.750 --> 54:37.525
You can't miss what you've never had.

54:37.625 --> 54:39.074
Can't you?

54:47.625 --> 54:49.157
I was gonna kill him.

54:53.625 --> 54:56.532
- Poor Cynthia.
- Saint Cynthia.

55:00.416 --> 55:01.483
She tried her best.

55:01.583 --> 55:03.115
- Did she?
- Yeah.

55:04.666 --> 55:06.157
Yeah.

55:06.500 --> 55:07.740
She did.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.615
She gave me a lot of love.

55:54.833 --> 55:56.858
What shall I tell him
if he phones, then?

55:56.958 --> 55:58.108
- Who?
- Maurice.

55:58.208 --> 55:59.733
I don't know. Tell him what you want.

55:59.833 --> 56:02.358
- Are you gonna bring your bloke or not?
- No, I ain't.

56:02.458 --> 56:05.025
- Have you asked him?
- No.

56:05.125 --> 56:07.365
- Hello?
- That'll be 'im now.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.650
- Hello?
- Let me talk to 'im.

56:09.750 --> 56:11.157
Shut it!

56:11.958 --> 56:13.449
Well, there ain't no one there.

56:14.458 --> 56:15.858
Be one of them perverts.

56:15.958 --> 56:17.233
- Sweetheart...
- Mum, will you stop

56:17.333 --> 56:19.025
going on about this fuckin' barbecue.

56:19.125 --> 56:21.483
You're going to see him now, ain't you?
You could ask him.

56:21.583 --> 56:24.907
I don't even know if I want him to go
and it ain't for ages anyway.

56:25.583 --> 56:27.240
See you later.

56:27.833 --> 56:30.066
- I, Zoe...
- I, Zoe...

56:30.166 --> 56:33.275
- Take you, Darren...
- Take you, Darren...

56:33.375 --> 56:34.650
To be my husband...

56:34.750 --> 56:35.775
To be my husband...

56:35.875 --> 56:37.108
To have and to hold...

56:37.208 --> 56:38.233
To have and to hold...

56:38.333 --> 56:39.566
From this day forward...

56:39.666 --> 56:40.900
From this day forward...

56:41.000 --> 56:42.025
For better, for worse...

56:42.125 --> 56:43.150
For better, for worse...

56:43.250 --> 56:45.691
- For richer, for poorer...
- For richer, for poorer...

56:45.791 --> 56:47.782
In sickness and in health...

57:02.500 --> 57:05.566
Darren and Zoe have given their consent

57:05.666 --> 57:08.490
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

57:09.041 --> 57:12.233
They, have declared their marriage
by joining of hands

57:12.333 --> 57:14.990
and by the giving
and receiving of rings.

57:15.125 --> 57:21.074
I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife.

57:29.125 --> 57:31.275
Ain't you seeing him tonight, then?

57:31.375 --> 57:33.199
I'm having an early night.

57:34.083 --> 57:35.400
Keep me company?

57:35.500 --> 57:36.907
I've got hangover.

57:38.125 --> 57:40.282
You should stop in more often.

57:43.916 --> 57:47.066
You are lookin' after yourself with him,
ain't you, sweetheart?

57:47.166 --> 57:48.233
What d'you mean?

57:48.333 --> 57:50.199
You know, taking care.

57:52.375 --> 57:54.865
I don't want to ask you nothing
personal, darling, but...

57:55.541 --> 57:56.775
Are you taking the pill?

57:56.875 --> 57:58.532
That is personal.

58:00.041 --> 58:02.650
- Why don't you bring him round?
- Leave it out.

58:02.750 --> 58:05.983
I'd like to meet him. I wouldn't know him
if he stood up in me soup.

58:06.083 --> 58:07.191
Don't hold your breath.

58:07.291 --> 58:09.150
You don't want to leave it up
to him, darling.

58:09.250 --> 58:11.240
- Men are all the same.
- Mum!

58:11.416 --> 58:13.490
I hope he uses a what's-name...

58:13.625 --> 58:14.608
Condoms.

58:14.708 --> 58:16.150
Mind your own business!

58:16.250 --> 58:17.483
They can leak.

58:17.583 --> 58:19.282
You wanna be careful.

58:19.625 --> 58:21.199
You're jealous, ain't ya?

58:21.875 --> 58:24.316
- Where is he tonight, anyway?
- I dunno.

58:24.416 --> 58:26.907
Most likely out giving
somebody else one.

58:27.375 --> 58:29.358
That's how I got caught with you.

58:29.458 --> 58:30.990
Running out of the pill.

58:31.458 --> 58:32.983
You could have a coil fitted.

58:33.083 --> 58:34.983
- Change the record.
- Dr Mulholland

58:35.083 --> 58:36.483
make an appointment.

58:36.583 --> 58:38.775
- You'd suit the sponge.
- Keep your voice down.

58:38.875 --> 58:42.775
I've got a Dutch cap floating around
somewhere upstairs. You could have that.

58:42.875 --> 58:45.316
Run it under the tap.
Bit of talcum powder.

58:45.416 --> 58:47.865
- Where are you going?
- I don't have to listen to this.

58:48.375 --> 58:50.240
Sweetheart...

58:52.041 --> 58:53.449
Roxanne.

58:54.166 --> 58:57.316
Sweetheart, darling...
I'm only trying to help you.

58:57.416 --> 58:58.691
Leave me alone.

58:58.791 --> 59:01.108
- I'm your mother.
- Get out of my room!

59:01.208 --> 59:04.275
It don't matter if you have a little baby.
I'll look after it.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.900
- I ain't gettin' pregnant.
- I'll give up me job.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.532
It's nothing to do with you!

59:08.833 --> 59:12.150
Yes, it bloody is! I'm not having you
dropping it in my door!

59:12.250 --> 59:13.608
Jesus Christ!

59:13.708 --> 59:15.983
- I'm sorry, darling. I didn't mean...
- Fuck off!

59:16.083 --> 59:18.532
You make me sick, you stupid bitch!

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.483
Hello.

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.907
I'm sorry to trouble you, but...

01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:26.532
I'm trying to locate a Cynthia Purley.

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:28.449
Yes?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.657
Is that Cynthia Purley?

01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:33.365
Yes.

01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:35.490
Cynthia Rose Purley?

01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:36.941
Yes.

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:39.074
Of 76 Quilter Street?

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:41.949
Yes. What is it you want, darling?

01:00:43.958 --> 01:00:45.324
Hello?

01:00:46.666 --> 01:00:48.233
Did you want Roxanne?

01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:49.400
She's gone out.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.282
- No.
- She ain't in any trouble, is she?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.941
No. It's about Elizabeth.

01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:57.074
Elizabeth. Elizabeth who?

01:00:57.666 --> 01:00:59.282
Elizabeth Purley.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.615
But she's dead.

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:08.400
- No, she isn't.
- She is, darling,

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.733
I should know.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.240
Well, I should know.

01:01:11.416 --> 01:01:13.233
Look, sweetheart. She's me mother.

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:15.566
She went in 1961.

01:01:15.666 --> 01:01:19.032
No, I mean baby Elizabeth Purley.

01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:21.240
Baby Eliz...

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.282
Who is this?

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:30.907
She was born on the 23rd of July, 1968.

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:34.532
At... Sorry about this...

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:43.407
Yeah. At the Haven,
Wells Grange Avenue, Sutton, Surrey.

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:49.907
Look, I'm sorry I know
this must be a shock to you.

01:02:56.041 --> 01:02:58.483
Listen, darling, what is it you want?

01:02:58.583 --> 01:02:59.858
I'm really sorry.

01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:02.907
You mustn't come round here, sweetheart.

01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:06.191
I didn't want to upset you.

01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:08.233
You mustn't do that.

01:03:08.333 --> 01:03:10.566
And you mustn't phone, neither.

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:12.033
I just needed to know.

01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:16.483
Yes, but you can't come round here
'cause no-one knows about you, see?

01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:17.691
Right.

01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:20.566
Promise me you won't come round.
Promise me.

01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:21.990
Look...

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:23.983
I've got your address.
If I wanted to come round,

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:27.574
- I'd have done it already.
- I'm ever so sorry, sweetheart.

01:03:28.916 --> 01:03:31.615
I'm a little bit upset.

01:03:33.708 --> 01:03:36.066
Promise me you won't come round?

01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:37.608
All right, I promise.

01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:39.324
Thank you.

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:43.824
Thank you.

01:03:47.666 --> 01:03:49.490
Can I meet you somewhere?

01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:52.775
Oh, I shouldn't think so, darling.

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:55.191
See, I've got lots of...

01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:57.566
I've got lots of questions
I want to ask you.

01:03:57.666 --> 01:04:00.025
Yeah, well I gotta go now.

01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:01.324
Please...

01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:11.199
What's your name, anyway?

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:15.949
- Hortense.
- Hortense?

01:04:16.166 --> 01:04:17.733
Yeah.

01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:19.650
Hortense what?

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:20.858
Cumberbatch.

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:22.441
Clumberbunch?

01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:24.615
That's a funny name, innit?

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:26.824
Yeah, I suppose it is.

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:32.115
Are you on the phone?

01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:35.282
Yeah do you want to take my number down?

01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:38.275
Oh, I don't think I've got a pencil.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.782
I'll wait.

01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:55.324
I've got one.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:59.407
It's 0171...

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:02.400
219...

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.699
Sorry, 619...

01:05:05.708 --> 01:05:07.490
4840.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.074
Yeah, ta-ta.

01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:00.365
Hello?

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:02.400
Hello?

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.358
Do you want to meet me or not, then?

01:06:04.458 --> 01:06:06.233
Oh, hello?

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:08.316
Yes or no. It's up to you.

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:11.150
Well, yeah, of course,
I want to meet you.

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:13.115
Well, then...

01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:17.865
Are you sure about this?

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:20.483
I mean, if you're not sure...

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.490
Where do you want to meet me?

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:24.816
Well, where would you like to meet?

01:06:24.916 --> 01:06:29.275
I don't know. Anywhere.
Not here, though.

01:06:29.375 --> 01:06:31.032
No, of course not.

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:36.449
What about outside
Holborn Tube Station?

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:40.490
Holborn.

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:42.990
When?

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.066
What are you doing this Saturday coming?

01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:49.316
Nothing. I'm never bloody
doing anything.

01:06:49.416 --> 01:06:50.941
Saturday, then.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.324
What time?

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:55.365
- 7:30?
- Half-past 7:00.

01:06:56.541 --> 01:06:59.858
Now, listen, you mustn't
phone me here again.

01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:01.816
Do you understand me?

01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:04.324
Otherwise, I won't come and meet you.

01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:09.615
Now, I'll see you on Saturday.

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:11.657
Hello?

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.282
Don't even know what you look like.

01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:33.566
- Hello, sweetheart.
- What's for tea?

01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:35.108
- Got you a bit of steak.
- What for?

01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:37.316
- Little treat for ya.
- Ain't you having none?

01:07:37.416 --> 01:07:39.483
Oh, I'll just fry myself an egg.
Do you want a beer?

01:07:39.583 --> 01:07:41.316
- We ain't got none.
- I got you some.

01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:43.115
Oh, did you?

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:46.240
- Are you going out?
- No, I'm stayin' in.

01:07:54.833 --> 01:07:57.449
I'm gonna have a few early nights.

01:07:58.625 --> 01:08:00.490
I've decided.

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:03.615
Excuse me.

01:09:03.957 --> 01:09:06.823
- Yeah, what is it, sweetheart?
- Are you Cynthia?

01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:10.990
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Hello, I'm Hortense.

01:09:11.957 --> 01:09:13.698
What you talking about?

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:17.157
Hortense Cumberbatch.
I spoke to you on the telephone.

01:09:18.332 --> 01:09:20.407
- What? That was you?
- Yeah.

01:09:21.916 --> 01:09:27.448
Oh, no, no, sweetheart. No, darling.

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:30.274
You've been ringing the wrong person.

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:32.198
Cynthia Purley.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:36.573
- Where'd you get my name from, anyway?
- It's on my birth certificate.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:40.274
What are you talking about
on your birth certificate? It can't be.

01:09:40.375 --> 01:09:42.948
It's got your name
and your address on it.

01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:47.240
There.

01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:53.399
No, that's all wrong, darling.
They've made a mistake down the offices.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.657
You wanna get down there,
get that sorted.

01:09:57.541 --> 01:09:59.066
That's someone havin' a joke.

01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:00.657
I don't think so.

01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:03.240
Let me have a look at that.

01:10:10.375 --> 01:10:13.282
I'm ever so sorry, sweetheart.

01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:19.324
It must be a bit
of a disappointment for you.

01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:25.907
Look, I really think you ought to see
these documents.

01:10:26.666 --> 01:10:28.483
Why, what is it?

01:10:28.583 --> 01:10:33.566
Why don't we... go somewhere and have...
And sit down?

01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:36.525
No, I think I'd better
be going, darling.

01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:39.324
Here, look, you've come
all this way. Please?

01:10:41.166 --> 01:10:44.275
Let's... Let's go and have
a cup of tea or something.

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:46.324
There's places down there.

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.657
Come on.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:04.240
I hope you find your mum, sweetheart.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.816
- You keep lookin'. Go on.
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:10.324
Oh. Nor should ya.

01:11:11.041 --> 01:11:13.365
My daughter smokes like a chimney.

01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:16.449
- You got a daughter?
- Yeah.

01:11:19.791 --> 01:11:21.907
Ain't never been in here before.

01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:27.865
They shouldn't go raising your hopes
like that. It ain't fair.

01:11:29.875 --> 01:11:31.657
Is this your signature?

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.865
This is stupid. I don't understand it.

01:11:42.166 --> 01:11:45.691
- I mean, I can't be your mother, can I?
- Why not?

01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:48.449
- Well, look at me.
- What?

01:11:49.125 --> 01:11:51.691
Listen, I don't mean
nothing by it, darling,

01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:56.865
but I ain't never been with a black man
in my life. No disrespect, nor nothing.

01:11:57.666 --> 01:12:00.490
I'd have remembered, wouldn't I?

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:14.949
Oh, bloody hell.

01:12:19.791 --> 01:12:24.532
Oh, Jesus Christ almighty!

01:12:37.166 --> 01:12:40.032
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:12:48.458 --> 01:12:51.407
I'm so ashamed.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.782
You shouldn't be ashamed.

01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:03.074
I can't look at you.

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:10.615
I didn't know, sweetheart.
Honest, I didn't know.

01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:11.858
What didn't you know?

01:13:11.958 --> 01:13:14.907
I didn't know you was black.

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:17.949
See, I...

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:22.240
I thought they'd got
the dates all wrong.

01:13:23.875 --> 01:13:26.566
All this time,
I thought you was born six...

01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:29.449
Six weeks premature, but you weren't.

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:34.407
You wasn't.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.365
Who was he?

01:13:45.791 --> 01:13:48.150
You don't want to know that, darling.

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.490
I do.

01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:56.282
Listen, I want to be honest with you, but I
can't tell you that, sweetheart. I'm sorry.

01:14:04.666 --> 01:14:06.365
I'm sorry.

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:13.157
Look at ya.

01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:21.941
It's a bit... I'm a bit of a
disappointment to you, ain't I?

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.240
No.

01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:26.108
You don't have to say that, darling.

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:27.574
I know.

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:31.532
You've been better off without me,
I can tell you that much.

01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:34.490
I done you a good turn.

01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:39.324
Your tea getting's cold.

01:14:51.291 --> 01:14:53.324
What's your mum like, then?

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:57.407
Does she mind you lookin' for me?

01:14:57.833 --> 01:14:59.108
My mum died recently.

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:01.157
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.240
What about your dad?

01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:07.907
- He's dead and all.
- Oh.

01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:21.865
- Are you married?
- No, no, I ain't...

01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:25.407
I ain't married, sweetheart.

01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:33.574
- Are you?
- No.

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:36.316
I'll bet you got a
boyfriend though, ain't ya?

01:15:36.416 --> 01:15:37.733
No, not at the moment.

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:40.699
Oh, a nice lookin' girl like you?

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.150
Have you got a boyfriend?

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:50.490
I give 'em all a wide berth.

01:15:50.708 --> 01:15:53.900
They got me into enough trouble
in the past, ain't they?

01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:26.441
- You got a job, have ya?
- Yeah.

01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:28.157
That's good.

01:16:30.416 --> 01:16:31.441
What doing?

01:16:31.541 --> 01:16:32.691
I'm an optometrist.

01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:37.574
I test eyes. Optician.

01:16:38.333 --> 01:16:39.949
Are you?

01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:43.615
Well...

01:16:45.958 --> 01:16:48.157
There's a turn-up.

01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:51.949
What do you do?

01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:54.657
I work in a factory.

01:16:56.166 --> 01:16:57.574
Do you like it?

01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:59.574
Well, it pays the rent.

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:04.615
How about your daughter?

01:17:06.541 --> 01:17:08.782
She works for the Council.

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:13.240
- Have you got any sisters?
- No, two brothers.

01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:17.490
Are they, adopted?

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:18.949
No.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.032
What do they do?

01:17:22.416 --> 01:17:26.032
One's a computer salesman
and the other one's got his own garage.

01:17:27.666 --> 01:17:31.574
I bet your mum was
proud of you, wasn't she?

01:17:32.791 --> 01:17:35.608
- Yeah, she was.
- Yeah, 'course she was.

01:17:35.708 --> 01:17:37.490
I'd have been proud.

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:51.990
Why didn't you want to see me?

01:17:52.875 --> 01:17:56.275
Well, 'cause nobody knows
about you, sweetheart.

01:17:56.375 --> 01:17:59.365
I don't want to upset me daughter, do I?

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:02.532
I mean, when I was born.

01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:06.407
Well, I couldn't.

01:18:07.958 --> 01:18:11.990
I was too upset, see?
They wanted me to look at ya.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:16.265
They wanted me to hold you, but I couldn't...
I just couldn't.

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:23.240
I didn't know if I was coming or going.
I was only a little girl meself, 16.

01:18:24.625 --> 01:18:26.532
I didn't have no choice.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.983
If I'd have seen you,
I'd have wanted to keep you.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:34.199
You do believe me,
don't you, sweetheart?

01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:44.032
I don't blame you, darlin'.

01:18:54.125 --> 01:18:56.566
You've only just found out?

01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:59.490
No, I've known since I was seven.

01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:03.365
- What? Your mum and dad told you, did they?
- Yeah, they did.

01:19:04.666 --> 01:19:07.074
They sound like nice people.

01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:08.824
Yeah.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.074
My mum told me on the plane
on our way back from Barbados.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.657
Little girl.

01:19:18.083 --> 01:19:19.782
Was you upset?

01:19:22.208 --> 01:19:24.282
I just looked out at the clouds.

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:49.365
Haven't you ever thought about me?

01:19:49.833 --> 01:19:52.449
Yeah, 'course I have.

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:57.157
But it ain't no good pining over
what you ain't got, is it?

01:19:58.458 --> 01:20:00.407
But didn't you think I'd look for you?

01:20:01.375 --> 01:20:03.365
No, I didn't, as it happens.

01:20:05.958 --> 01:20:07.949
Wish you hadn't bothered now, don't you?

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.407
No, I'm glad.

01:20:13.541 --> 01:20:16.407
I don't want to disrupt your family
or anything.

01:20:17.416 --> 01:20:19.324
I just had to see you.

01:20:22.333 --> 01:20:24.365
I had to know who you were.

01:20:25.416 --> 01:20:32.407
Listen, I want to wish you all the best,
sweetheart, whatever you do.

01:20:32.541 --> 01:20:34.574
And I'll be thinkin' of you.

01:21:13.458 --> 01:21:15.074
Bit quiet, ain't ya?

01:21:15.916 --> 01:21:17.115
What's up?

01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:21.032
- You goin' out?
- Yeah, in a bit.

01:21:21.875 --> 01:21:23.191
You feelin' all right?

01:21:23.291 --> 01:21:27.365
Oh, there's nothing the matter with me,
sweetheart. Nothing at all.

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:32.740
- Did you find anything today?
- Frozen chicken.

01:21:34.416 --> 01:21:36.699
- What, in the road?
- No, in a bin.

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:40.490
It was still cold.

01:21:40.875 --> 01:21:42.490
Some dirty magazines.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.157
- Did you bring them home?
- No.

01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:51.824
Still, I suppose there are worse jobs.

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:57.532
Gotta laugh, ain't you, sweetheart?

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:01.782
Else you'd cry.

01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:35.115
Hello?

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.907
- Is that Hortense?
- Speaking.

01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:39.782
It's Cynthia.

01:22:40.375 --> 01:22:41.574
Hello.

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.657
I didn't think you'd be in.

01:22:44.916 --> 01:22:46.449
I am.

01:22:47.916 --> 01:22:52.032
Well, I just...
wanted to ring up and say...

01:22:52.875 --> 01:22:55.865
How nice it was to meet you yesterday.
That's all.

01:22:56.583 --> 01:22:57.782
Thank you.

01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:01.407
Been thinkin' about you all day.

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:03.740
I've been thinking about you.

01:23:04.125 --> 01:23:05.782
Yeah, well...

01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:09.574
I just wanted to say that.

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:12.949
Thank you.

01:23:13.666 --> 01:23:16.240
I don't know what to say now.
Daft, ain't it?

01:23:21.291 --> 01:23:22.615
Got home all right, did you?

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:24.990
Yeah, thank you.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:35.816
What have you been doing today?

01:23:35.916 --> 01:23:38.449
Oh, just out the back sunning meself.

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:41.108
What you been doing?

01:23:41.208 --> 01:23:42.816
Just chillin' out, really.

01:23:42.916 --> 01:23:43.941
Yeah, hot, ain't it?

01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:45.615
Yeah.

01:23:48.083 --> 01:23:52.032
Well, that all I wanted
to say, sweetheart.

01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:54.490
Ta-ta, then.

01:23:54.958 --> 01:23:56.865
I'd really like to see you again.

01:23:58.125 --> 01:24:00.115
- Would ya?
- Yeah.

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:01.615
Oh, that'd be nice.

01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:04.157
Do you like Italian food?

01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:08.733
Yeah. Eat anything, me.
Chinese, kebabs, the lot.

01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:13.157
- What?
- Nothing.

01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:14.907
It's great.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.790
And...

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:38.157
Okay, other side, please.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.151
And...

01:24:43.791 --> 01:24:47.074
Lovely. So if you bring your face
round this way, please.

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:48.532
Can you shut the door, please?

01:24:50.333 --> 01:24:51.865
Yeah, sure.

01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:58.449
Sorry.

01:25:00.916 --> 01:25:02.691
So, who did your original photographs?

01:25:02.791 --> 01:25:03.775
My dad, actually.

01:25:03.875 --> 01:25:06.949
But my solicitor said
that they weren't good enough.

01:25:07.208 --> 01:25:10.482
- Do you have a police photographer?
- No.

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:12.566
I'm just gonna come in a bit closer.

01:25:12.666 --> 01:25:15.108
So I hope you don't suffer
from claustrophobia.

01:25:15.208 --> 01:25:16.865
No, I don't actually.

01:25:17.125 --> 01:25:18.574
That's good.

01:25:23.208 --> 01:25:26.824
- Okay, so I'm just gonna move your...
- Thank you.

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:29.699
Sorry. That's great.

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:33.740
Okay. And...

01:25:34.291 --> 01:25:35.699
A little bit closer.

01:25:40.916 --> 01:25:44.824
Now, I know this isn't very nice.

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:47.865
But it's gotta be done, hasn't it?

01:25:49.916 --> 01:25:51.733
I want them to look as bad as possible.

01:25:51.833 --> 01:25:53.199
Of course.

01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:57.074
I lost my job. I was good at my job.

01:25:57.666 --> 01:25:58.990
What did you do?

01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:02.282
I'm a beauty consultant.

01:26:03.541 --> 01:26:06.358
Okay. Now, if you just bring your chin up.
Put it up there.

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:09.340
Lovely, and... That's it.

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:14.490
So, what actually happened to you?

01:26:15.791 --> 01:26:18.324
My seat belt was broken,
I went through the windscreen.

01:26:20.416 --> 01:26:23.115
It wasn't my car. I wasn't driving.
It wasn't my fault.

01:26:23.958 --> 01:26:25.441
- Yeah, you said.
- It wasn't.

01:26:27.958 --> 01:26:29.157
Are you okay?

01:26:35.333 --> 01:26:36.941
Did the driver sustain any injuries?

01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:38.907
No, unfortunately.

01:26:39.666 --> 01:26:41.816
He's obviously not in your good books.

01:26:41.916 --> 01:26:44.233
I ain't seen him since.
I don't want to see him, either.

01:26:44.333 --> 01:26:46.157
Life isn't fair, is it?

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:49.824
Someone always draws the short straw.

01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.365
Okay, that's very good. Yeah.

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.074
One more.

01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:00.816
- Here's your receipt.
- Thank you.

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:03.275
So, if you give us a ring in the morning,
we'll see what we can do.

01:27:03.375 --> 01:27:04.574
Fine.

01:27:04.958 --> 01:27:07.907
Bye, then. Mind how you go.

01:27:10.833 --> 01:27:13.365
Oh, Maurice, that's terrible.

01:27:13.833 --> 01:27:16.949
- How'd she do that then?
- Car crash.

01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:19.740
Oh, she's so lovely.

01:27:19.916 --> 01:27:22.740
- Not any more, she isn't.
- It's tragic.

01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:25.108
She's getting some ear hole
from that dosser now.

01:27:25.208 --> 01:27:28.449
Oh, he's been looking at me.
Gives me the creeps.

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:35.574
I don't believe it.

01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:39.900
How much money
do you think she'll get, then?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.365
- What?
- Insurance.

01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:45.699
Oh, if she's lucky, 15, 20 grand.

01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:48.574
I don't know what I'd do
if it happened to me.

01:27:49.291 --> 01:27:51.990
Think I'd kill meself.

01:27:58.666 --> 01:28:00.324
- Hello.
- Hiya.

01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:03.066
- Didn't expect to see you.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:04.566
Hello, Monica.

01:28:04.666 --> 01:28:06.032
Hi, Jane.

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:09.191
Just been for a facial.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.

01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:11.032
- Look over there.
- What?

01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:13.816
- That bloke.
- What bloke?

01:28:13.916 --> 01:28:15.025
See who it is?

01:28:15.125 --> 01:28:17.490
- What? By the lamppost?
- Yeah.

01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:19.449
It's Stuart Christian, isn't it?

01:28:19.708 --> 01:28:21.949
- No.
- It is.

01:28:23.041 --> 01:28:25.615
- But he's in Sydney.
- Is he?

01:28:27.166 --> 01:28:28.657
He's coming over.

01:28:29.208 --> 01:28:30.566
Doesn't look very well, does he?

01:28:30.666 --> 01:28:33.566
- There's that man!
- It's all right, Jane, we know him.

01:28:33.666 --> 01:28:34.650
Do ya?

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.150
What does he want?

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:37.733
God knows.

01:28:37.833 --> 01:28:39.358
Well, it's over to you then, buster.

01:28:39.458 --> 01:28:41.199
Thanks very much.

01:28:45.208 --> 01:28:46.865
Hello, Stuart.

01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:49.032
Maurice.

01:28:50.333 --> 01:28:51.907
Long time no see.

01:28:52.208 --> 01:28:55.490
Yeah. How's things?

01:28:55.833 --> 01:28:58.615
- Fine, thanks. Fine.
- Good.

01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:01.324
You're looking well.

01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:04.199
- You're still here, then.
- Yep.

01:29:05.583 --> 01:29:06.782
Good.

01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:10.157
I thought we'd lost you to Australia.

01:29:10.958 --> 01:29:12.699
Well...

01:29:16.416 --> 01:29:18.816
- How's the wife and kids? Maureen.
- Monica.

01:29:18.916 --> 01:29:20.066
Haven't got any kids.

01:29:20.166 --> 01:29:21.191
- Haven't you?
- No.

01:29:21.291 --> 01:29:23.157
She's great, thanks.

01:29:23.916 --> 01:29:25.657
Good on you, mate.

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:40.900
You still in the game?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.032
Look at all this.

01:29:43.583 --> 01:29:45.157
What are you doing?

01:29:46.416 --> 01:29:48.532
It's lost its style, Maurice.

01:29:49.208 --> 01:29:50.824
Has it?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.865
Looks like a dentist's waiting room.

01:29:58.291 --> 01:29:59.949
I'd kill for a cup of tea.

01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:06.782
If you're 21, or a millionaire,
it's great.

01:30:07.625 --> 01:30:09.824
Or you've got nine kids...

01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:12.865
You're fine. Brilliant.

01:30:13.416 --> 01:30:15.032
Open arms.

01:30:15.250 --> 01:30:17.574
But for guys like you and me,

01:30:18.291 --> 01:30:21.282
it doesn't matter how good you are.
Forget it.

01:30:23.291 --> 01:30:26.900
But it was an experience
and now I'm back.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.740
That's too bad.

01:30:28.958 --> 01:30:31.441
You were full of such big plans as well.

01:30:31.541 --> 01:30:33.324
Well, it's a big place.

01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:34.733
That's true.

01:30:34.833 --> 01:30:36.324
Too fuckin' big.

01:30:38.375 --> 01:30:41.324
You're looking as gorgeous
as ever, Monica.

01:30:44.041 --> 01:30:46.157
So, Stuart, are you thinking
about setting up again?

01:30:46.583 --> 01:30:48.199
No, forget it.

01:30:48.958 --> 01:30:50.574
Too much of a pain.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.157
You know what it's like, Maurice.

01:30:53.375 --> 01:30:55.400
You sweat your balls off for years.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:31:00.240
You try and make people happy
and what do you get back? Nothing.

01:31:00.708 --> 01:31:01.907
Thanks.

01:31:07.666 --> 01:31:10.441
Oh, by the way, Stuart,
this is Jane, my assistant.

01:31:10.541 --> 01:31:13.566
This is Mr Christian, the gentleman
I bought the business from.

01:31:13.666 --> 01:31:15.949
- Hello.
- Hiya, Jane.

01:31:17.875 --> 01:31:20.949
- I hope he's treating you well.
- He's all right.

01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:23.066
You can work for me any time.

01:31:23.166 --> 01:31:25.532
I'm all right where I am, thank you.

01:31:32.291 --> 01:31:34.824
Your wife must've been sorry
to come back.

01:31:35.583 --> 01:31:36.949
Which wife?

01:31:38.416 --> 01:31:39.990
That bitch?

01:31:40.833 --> 01:31:43.324
She never came out there
in the first place.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.941
So, where are you living
at the moment, Stuart?

01:31:48.041 --> 01:31:49.650
- Down in Grays.
- Essex.

01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:51.691
Yeah. My mum's place.

01:31:51.791 --> 01:31:53.108
Must be nice for her.

01:31:53.208 --> 01:31:55.074
Having her boy to fuss over.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:56.490
She's dead.

01:31:58.166 --> 01:32:00.199
She died when I was still in Bangkok.

01:32:05.375 --> 01:32:07.532
- Sorry to hear that.
- That's a shame.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.990
Didn't see much of her, anyway.

01:32:12.833 --> 01:32:14.282
It's my dad I miss.

01:32:17.916 --> 01:32:19.949
You win some, you lose some.

01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:41.816
You must've had some lovely weather
in Australia.

01:32:41.916 --> 01:32:43.115
Too hot.

01:32:45.166 --> 01:32:48.740
It's too hot over there,
it's too cold over here.

01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:04.900
Hasn't changed much in here.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.532
Just a lick of paint.

01:33:07.041 --> 01:33:09.025
Still got the Bronika, then?

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:10.449
Yep.

01:33:11.875 --> 01:33:15.490
I should've thought you'd be able
to afford a Hasselblad by now, Maurice.

01:33:15.666 --> 01:33:16.865
I can.

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:20.400
Oh, well-off, are ya?

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.282
Surviving, mate. Yeah.

01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:26.949
Yeah.

01:33:27.791 --> 01:33:30.824
You've done very well
out of my business, haven't ya?

01:33:31.041 --> 01:33:32.358
My business.

01:33:32.458 --> 01:33:35.108
- No, it's my business, Maurice.
- No, Stuart, no.

01:33:35.208 --> 01:33:37.650
Used to be your business.
I bought it from you. It's my business.

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:40.941
- Listen. This was an antique shop.
- That's right.

01:33:41.041 --> 01:33:43.233
- There was nothing here.
- That's right, I know.

01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:46.816
I gave you my goodwill.
I gave you my clientele.

01:33:46.916 --> 01:33:48.733
I gave you my fucking reputation.

01:33:48.833 --> 01:33:50.240
You gave me nothing, Stuart.

01:33:51.083 --> 01:33:52.775
With all due respect,
your client list was shit.

01:33:52.875 --> 01:33:54.365
It wasn't.

01:33:55.416 --> 01:33:59.865
I followed it up. I wrote to them,
I rang 'em. I didn't get one bite.

01:34:00.541 --> 01:34:03.608
Now, if there's any success
in this shop, it's down to me.

01:34:03.708 --> 01:34:04.941
That's bollocks!

01:34:05.041 --> 01:34:07.191
No, it's not bollocks, Stuart.
It's the truth.

01:34:07.291 --> 01:34:08.525
How many weddings do you do?

01:34:08.625 --> 01:34:09.775
Oh, enough.

01:34:09.875 --> 01:34:10.941
How many?

01:34:11.041 --> 01:34:12.233
About 40 a year.

01:34:12.333 --> 01:34:13.816
I used to do 140.

01:34:13.916 --> 01:34:16.108
- What, personally?
- No, not personally. No.

01:34:16.208 --> 01:34:18.108
- Nobody does them personally.
- I do.

01:34:18.208 --> 01:34:20.025
Well, then, you're a bloody fool.

01:34:20.125 --> 01:34:22.150
You get people in. Get 'em out there.

01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:24.858
If the work's there, take it.
You got to grab it while you can.

01:34:24.958 --> 01:34:27.233
It's not in my interest
to get some tosser in.

01:34:27.333 --> 01:34:28.483
I mean, I'll have no control.

01:34:28.583 --> 01:34:31.233
- He could fuck up my reputation.
- I'm not a tosser.

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:33.566
- I didn't say you were.
- I'm not a fuckin' tosser.

01:34:33.666 --> 01:34:35.066
- I'm not talkin' about you.
- Don't call me a tosser.

01:34:35.166 --> 01:34:37.532
I wasn't talking about you, Stuart.

01:34:38.958 --> 01:34:40.532
I can still do it.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.532
I've still got an eye.

01:34:44.583 --> 01:34:46.240
They can't teach you that.

01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:49.532
I'm still a photographer.

01:34:50.333 --> 01:34:51.782
'Course you are.

01:34:57.208 --> 01:35:01.615
So if you want someone to help you out,
no worries, mate.

01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:08.407
I'll be all right.

01:35:08.916 --> 01:35:13.032
Right, right. I...
I see what you're saying, Stuart, yeah.

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:15.275
I'll bear it in mind.

01:35:15.375 --> 01:35:18.365
- You could lend me a camera.
- Yeah, sure.

01:35:19.208 --> 01:35:21.199
I've had mine nicked.

01:35:28.208 --> 01:35:29.782
Yeah, great.

01:35:32.125 --> 01:35:33.532
Thanks.

01:35:33.791 --> 01:35:35.115
Sure.

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:49.740
I thought we were
never gonna get rid of him.

01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:53.032
There, but for the grace of God.

01:36:15.875 --> 01:36:17.699
Tea's on the table.

01:36:17.916 --> 01:36:19.324
Right.

01:36:26.208 --> 01:36:28.532
- Ain't you having none?
- No.

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:30.657
Why not?

01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:35.449
I'm going out.

01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:38.657
Where are you going?

01:36:42.708 --> 01:36:44.275
I'm off now, then, sweetheart.

01:36:44.375 --> 01:36:46.025
Ain't you gonna tell me where?

01:36:46.125 --> 01:36:47.691
You never tell me where you're going.

01:36:47.791 --> 01:36:49.233
But you don't never go nowhere.

01:36:49.333 --> 01:36:51.941
Well, I'm going somewhere tonight.
Ta-ta.

01:36:52.041 --> 01:36:53.233
Have fun.

01:36:53.333 --> 01:36:54.990
Don't wait up.

01:37:00.916 --> 01:37:03.025
She's been acting right funny.

01:37:03.125 --> 01:37:06.733
- Where's she gone?
- Oh, fuck knows. She wouldn't tell us.

01:37:06.833 --> 01:37:08.358
He's all right, though, Maurice.

01:37:08.458 --> 01:37:10.483
He's always got plenty
of wine in and that.

01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:13.532
- We'll get well-pissed.
- Yeah, nice one.

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:21.275
I'm a little bit shy of you,
to tell you the truth, sweetheart.

01:37:21.375 --> 01:37:23.282
Me? Oh, you shouldn't be.

01:37:23.708 --> 01:37:25.990
Look at you, sitting there.

01:37:26.708 --> 01:37:29.324
- You look like a model.
- Oh, do I?

01:37:30.125 --> 01:37:32.358
I bet you was a pretty little girl,
wasn't you?

01:37:32.458 --> 01:37:34.115
Yeah. Lovely.

01:37:36.041 --> 01:37:37.150
Don't do that!

01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:39.907
You'll stay like it.

01:37:40.458 --> 01:37:43.282
Stop it! Don't spoil it.

01:37:44.916 --> 01:37:47.400
I used to drive my mum mad,
pulling faces.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.782
Did you? I bet she was
a laugh, wasn't she?

01:37:50.458 --> 01:37:51.650
No, not really.

01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:53.441
Thought you said she was a midwife.

01:37:53.541 --> 01:37:55.233
Yeah, she was.

01:37:55.333 --> 01:37:58.865
Yeah, I'd like to have been one of them.
I love babies.

01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:05.532
- I'm sorry, darling.
- It's all right.

01:38:06.125 --> 01:38:07.275
Cheers.

01:38:07.375 --> 01:38:08.824
Cheers.

01:38:11.791 --> 01:38:12.983
Is that all right for you?

01:38:13.083 --> 01:38:14.650
Yeah, it's lovely.

01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:16.578
Wet, ain't it?

01:38:17.833 --> 01:38:20.316
Where is this food, then? I'm ravishing.

01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:23.240
What?

01:38:28.125 --> 01:38:31.275
I've got so many things I wanna ask you,
but I can't remember what they are.

01:38:31.375 --> 01:38:33.865
Nice to have somebody to talk to, innit?

01:38:35.208 --> 01:38:37.324
- Give us your hand here.
- Oh...

01:38:39.791 --> 01:38:42.282
Oh, you've got beautiful skin.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.574
Right, let's have a look at you.

01:38:46.916 --> 01:38:48.157
What, can you read palms?

01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:50.074
I used to.

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:54.566
Ain't done it for years.
Nobody's interested no more.

01:38:54.666 --> 01:38:56.400
Now, if I didn't know you,

01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:00.407
I could see just by lookin' here
what a nice girl you are.

01:39:00.541 --> 01:39:05.360
Big heart. Ooh, you're gonna live
to a ripe old age an' all.

01:39:06.166 --> 01:39:07.816
Let's have a look.

01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:10.657
- Couple of kids. Do you want babies?
- Wow.

01:39:10.875 --> 01:39:12.115
I'm not sure, really.

01:39:12.375 --> 01:39:13.483
Oh, don't ya?

01:39:13.583 --> 01:39:17.032
- Maybe, I don't know yet.
- Yeah, 'course you do.

01:39:18.375 --> 01:39:21.650
- And what star sign are you?
- Leo. I'm on the cusp of Cancer.

01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:23.941
And when's your birthday? Oh.

01:39:24.041 --> 01:39:28.199
23rd of July, ain't it?
You'd think I'd know that, wouldn't ya?

01:39:30.208 --> 01:39:31.816
That was the other day, wasn't it?

01:39:31.916 --> 01:39:33.233
Yeah, Sunday.

01:39:33.333 --> 01:39:36.740
Well, why didn't you say nothing
when I phoned ya?

01:39:37.333 --> 01:39:38.316
It's not a big deal.

01:39:38.416 --> 01:39:40.566
- D'you have a party?
- No.

01:39:40.666 --> 01:39:42.025
What d'you do, then?

01:39:42.125 --> 01:39:45.532
Stayed in, read me book,
had a little drink.

01:39:45.833 --> 01:39:47.490
- What, on your own?
- Yeah.

01:39:50.083 --> 01:39:53.240
Well, happy birthday
for Sunday, sweetheart.

01:39:53.833 --> 01:39:55.782
Thank you.

01:39:57.041 --> 01:39:58.407
You're out now, ain't you?

01:39:59.791 --> 01:40:01.691
Yeah. In good company.

01:40:01.791 --> 01:40:03.532
With your mum.

01:40:26.541 --> 01:40:29.150
Have you thought about
having some driving lessons?

01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:31.441
- What for?
- I could get you some for your birthday.

01:40:31.541 --> 01:40:32.983
Don't be stupid.

01:40:33.083 --> 01:40:35.949
Get yourself a little motor?

01:40:36.208 --> 01:40:38.066
Ain't you going out tonight?

01:40:38.166 --> 01:40:40.449
- No.
- Why? What's happened?

01:40:40.791 --> 01:40:42.358
- You going out?
- Yeah, later.

01:40:42.458 --> 01:40:43.608
- Where are you going?
- Down the pub.

01:40:43.708 --> 01:40:46.441
- I hope you're taking care of yourself.
- What d'you mean?

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:48.941
Well, you don't wanna go
getting knocked up, do ya?

01:40:49.041 --> 01:40:51.108
Don't be so bloody cheeky.

01:40:51.208 --> 01:40:52.990
Not at your age.

01:41:14.125 --> 01:41:16.782
- All right?
- Missed a bit, darlin'.

01:41:55.416 --> 01:41:56.691
Who's this?

01:41:56.791 --> 01:41:59.324
Oh, don't start all that again.

01:42:00.083 --> 01:42:01.775
Come on, who is it?

01:42:01.875 --> 01:42:04.657
- It ain't me, is it? Well, who?
- No.

01:42:04.833 --> 01:42:06.740
Sylvester Stallone.

01:42:07.375 --> 01:42:10.074
I can't understand a word he says.

01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:14.449
- You like looking at him, though.
- No, he ain't my sort.

01:42:15.208 --> 01:42:17.482
- What is your type?
- What, film star?

01:42:17.582 --> 01:42:19.700
- Yeah.
- Marlon.

01:42:20.625 --> 01:42:23.532
Like a bloke with a bit of meat on him.

01:42:24.458 --> 01:42:27.824
What sort of bloke
do you go in for, then?

01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:32.150
Intelligent, sensitive.

01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:33.858
Well, don't you care
what they look like?

01:42:33.958 --> 01:42:36.907
Yeah, but they've gotta have
something going on upstairs.

01:42:37.958 --> 01:42:40.483
You only have black boyfriends, do you?

01:42:40.583 --> 01:42:41.824
No.

01:42:45.875 --> 01:42:50.740
How d'you look after yourself, then,
y'know, if you don't wanna have babies?

01:42:53.041 --> 01:42:54.316
Condoms.

01:42:54.416 --> 01:42:56.650
Oh, you just stop at that then, do you?

01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:59.608
- Yeah, it's the best way, really.
- Ooh, you can't be too careful...

01:42:59.708 --> 01:43:03.282
- ...can you, these days?
- You gotta protect yourself.

01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:06.441
It's my daughter's birthday next week.

01:43:06.541 --> 01:43:08.316
- How old is she?
- 21.

01:43:08.416 --> 01:43:09.441
Nice age.

01:43:09.541 --> 01:43:12.525
Well, she's your sister now,
really, ain't she?

01:43:12.625 --> 01:43:14.740
Yeah, I suppose she is.

01:43:17.416 --> 01:43:20.282
- Does she look like you?
- Yeah, a bit.

01:43:20.791 --> 01:43:23.532
You look more like me than she does.

01:43:24.416 --> 01:43:26.449
We're the same build.

01:43:27.375 --> 01:43:29.400
What are her eyes like?

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.824
Blue.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.699
My brother's doing a party for her.

01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:39.483
That's nice.
At least it takes the strain off of you.

01:43:39.583 --> 01:43:41.865
Yeah, well, there is that.

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:45.316
Shame you ain't comin', really.

01:43:45.416 --> 01:43:47.646
Meet your new family.

01:43:48.375 --> 01:43:50.157
Oh, sweetheart!

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:52.574
I nearly forgot!

01:43:54.458 --> 01:43:56.949
- Happy birthday for Sunday.
- Oh.

01:43:57.666 --> 01:44:01.865
- Oh, you shouldn't have bothered. Oh.
- Oh, it ain't nothing much.

01:44:06.458 --> 01:44:09.115
Aw. Oh, thank you.

01:44:11.166 --> 01:44:13.115
Don't start crying.

01:44:13.541 --> 01:44:15.566
- Perhaps I should ask him.
- What?

01:44:15.666 --> 01:44:17.400
If I can take someone.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.691
Oh, I don't know.
It's a family thing, isn't it?

01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:23.157
Well, you're family, ain't ya?
I'm proud of ya.

01:44:25.666 --> 01:44:30.365
Listen, Maurice, sweetheart,
I wanted to ask you a favour.

01:44:30.708 --> 01:44:32.483
Oh, yeah. What's that, then?

01:44:32.583 --> 01:44:35.275
- You know the party Sunday?
- Barbecue, yeah.

01:44:35.375 --> 01:44:36.574
Yeah.

01:44:37.125 --> 01:44:40.199
Can I bring a mate, sweetheart?

01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:43.949
Hello?

01:44:44.375 --> 01:44:45.358
Is it a bloke?

01:44:45.458 --> 01:44:47.483
Of course it ain't a bloke,
you silly bugger.

01:44:47.583 --> 01:44:51.032
- Chance'd be a fine thing.
- Who is it, then?

01:44:51.250 --> 01:44:55.199
Oh, just someone at work.
We've been out a couple of times.

01:44:55.541 --> 01:44:58.282
And I was meant to have seen her Sunday,
only I forgot.

01:44:59.125 --> 01:45:01.400
- Is that all right, then?
- I suppose so.

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.525
What d'you mean, you suppose so?

01:45:03.625 --> 01:45:06.074
- No, it'd be fine.
- Smashing.

01:45:06.625 --> 01:45:07.865
I'll have to check it out, though.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.240
Check it out? Who with?

01:45:10.458 --> 01:45:13.025
Listen... if I don't phone you back,
bring her, all right?

01:45:13.125 --> 01:45:14.983
I don't wanna upset nobody.

01:45:15.083 --> 01:45:17.900
- Oh, don't worry.
- Are you sure, then?

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.233
Yeah, yeah, no problem, yeah.

01:45:20.333 --> 01:45:23.483
Okay, then, sweetheart.
Lookin' forward to it.

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:25.608
All right, yeah.
Well, say hello to Roxanne for me.

01:45:25.708 --> 01:45:26.983
Yeah.

01:45:27.083 --> 01:45:30.157
- Ta-ta, then.
- All right, ta-ta. Bye, Cynth.

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:35.316
Listen, I spoke to my little brother today,
and he says it's all right.

01:45:35.416 --> 01:45:37.699
So, do you wanna come, then?

01:45:38.666 --> 01:45:40.108
Oh, I don't know.

01:45:40.208 --> 01:45:42.490
I told him you was me mate.

01:45:42.625 --> 01:45:44.608
I'd still feel a bit awkward.

01:45:44.708 --> 01:45:48.615
Oh, don't be daft, sweetheart.
You'll be with me, won't ya?

01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:50.441
It wouldn't feel right.

01:45:50.541 --> 01:45:52.740
I thought you wanted to come.

01:45:53.333 --> 01:45:54.657
Yeah.

01:45:55.125 --> 01:45:58.324
Oh, well,
'course if you've changed your mind.

01:45:59.083 --> 01:46:00.865
I was lookin' forward to it.

01:46:01.166 --> 01:46:02.615
Oh, I know.

01:46:03.333 --> 01:46:04.740
What d'you think, then?

01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:06.490
All right. I'll come.

01:46:06.625 --> 01:46:08.108
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

01:46:08.208 --> 01:46:10.691
All right, then, sweetheart, listen.

01:46:10.791 --> 01:46:14.316
I'll give you a ring later in the week,
and give you the address and everything.

01:46:14.416 --> 01:46:17.150
- Okay, then.
- Okay, ta-ta, then.

01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:18.449
Bye-bye.

01:46:27.958 --> 01:46:30.365
You should've just said yes.

01:46:30.541 --> 01:46:32.907
Makin' me look like a... Oh.

01:46:33.791 --> 01:46:37.066
- I can hardly say no now. Oh.
- That's up to you.

01:46:37.166 --> 01:46:39.525
We don't know anything about this person,
whoever she is.

01:46:39.625 --> 01:46:41.733
It's some new mate.
They've been out a few times.

01:46:41.833 --> 01:46:44.066
Oh, two hysterical nutters.

01:46:44.166 --> 01:46:46.175
I'm just glad she's got a friend.

01:46:46.451 --> 01:46:50.441
- I'm gonna have a great time.
- I thought I'd ask Jane as well.

01:46:50.541 --> 01:46:54.775
Anybody else you want to invite?
We've only got four garden chairs.

01:46:57.041 --> 01:46:59.740
Oh, give us two of them painkillers.

01:47:02.875 --> 01:47:04.532
There you go.

01:47:05.125 --> 01:47:07.782
Do you fancy some fish and chips?

01:47:08.250 --> 01:47:10.108
Don't be sarcastic.

01:47:10.208 --> 01:47:11.990
I wasn't. Sorry.

01:47:42.875 --> 01:47:44.532
Cheers, mate.

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:53.983
- There's a bell 'ere.
- Don't do that!

01:47:54.083 --> 01:47:56.532
- I've just done the knocker!
- All right!

01:47:57.541 --> 01:47:58.900
Hello, there.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.025
Hello, sweetheart.

01:48:01.125 --> 01:48:02.566
You got here in one piece, then?

01:48:02.666 --> 01:48:04.775
Long time no see.

01:48:04.875 --> 01:48:06.608
Yes, that's right. Thank you.

01:48:06.708 --> 01:48:08.733
- Hello, birthday girl!
- All right, Monica?

01:48:08.833 --> 01:48:11.490
- Oh, look at you!
- This is Paul.

01:48:11.666 --> 01:48:12.941
- Hello, Paul.
- How d'you do?

01:48:13.041 --> 01:48:14.691
Nice to meet you.

01:48:14.791 --> 01:48:16.032
Oh, here's Maurice.

01:48:17.666 --> 01:48:19.574
Now, come away in.

01:48:21.458 --> 01:48:23.490
- Hi, Jane.
- Hello, Monica.

01:48:26.791 --> 01:48:30.199
Oh, this is Jane. Maurice has just been
picking her up from the station.

01:48:31.166 --> 01:48:34.025
Here he is. Hello, sweetheart.

01:48:34.125 --> 01:48:36.782
- Hiya.
- All right, Maurice?

01:48:37.916 --> 01:48:39.775
- I got you that.
- You didn't have to do that.

01:48:39.875 --> 01:48:42.350
- It's all right. Yeah.
- All right?

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:44.858
This is Paul, Maurice.

01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:46.775
- All right, mate.
- Ain't you got one for me, then?

01:48:46.875 --> 01:48:49.740
- Yeah, 'course I have.
- Hello, darlin'.

01:48:49.916 --> 01:48:50.941
Don't kill him.

01:48:51.041 --> 01:48:54.824
Cor, you've landed on your feet here,
ain't you, Maurice?

01:48:55.166 --> 01:48:56.608
This is Jane, my lovely assistant.

01:48:56.708 --> 01:48:58.566
Yeah, talked to you on the phone,
ain't I, Jane?

01:48:58.666 --> 01:49:01.108
- Yeah, that's right.
- Oh, can I take your coats?

01:49:01.208 --> 01:49:02.400
- Yes.
- Right, what d'you want to drink?

01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:04.941
- Red, white, rosé, beer?
- Oh, I'll have white, Maurice.

01:49:05.041 --> 01:49:07.983
- Yeah, beer. You're welcome.
- Oh, thanks a lot, cheers. Cynth?

01:49:08.083 --> 01:49:09.941
- I'll have white, please, Maurice.
- Jane?

01:49:10.041 --> 01:49:11.865
- Rosé.
- Okey-doke.

01:49:13.875 --> 01:49:16.066
- Where's the friend, then?
- I've no idea.

01:49:16.166 --> 01:49:17.566
Have you got an ashtray, darlin'?

01:49:17.666 --> 01:49:22.483
Oh, there's one on the coffee table, Cynthia.
I didn't think you would've given up.

01:49:22.583 --> 01:49:25.191
Oh, one of the few
pleasures in life, Monica.

01:49:25.291 --> 01:49:28.400
- These are very bright.
- Don't you like 'em?

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:31.199
Yeah. I'll just put them in a vase.

01:49:34.208 --> 01:49:37.115
- What you got that up there for?
- We like it.

01:49:37.625 --> 01:49:40.358
Well, don't laugh. It's stupid.

01:49:40.458 --> 01:49:42.358
It's one of my early works.

01:49:42.458 --> 01:49:43.608
You miserable little git.

01:49:43.708 --> 01:49:45.358
He was fucking around behind the camera.

01:49:45.458 --> 01:49:47.733
Oi, mind your language, little sod.

01:49:49.708 --> 01:49:52.066
- So how's work, then?
- Oh, it's all right, yeah.

01:49:52.166 --> 01:49:53.775
- Are you still enjoying it?
- Yeah, it's all right.

01:49:53.875 --> 01:49:54.941
When are you going to college again?

01:49:55.041 --> 01:49:56.108
Shut up about college.

01:49:56.208 --> 01:49:57.941
- You're going to college, ain't you?
- No, I ain't.

01:49:58.041 --> 01:49:59.400
Well, you should do.
You got a good brain.

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:00.733
I don't want to use it, though.

01:50:00.833 --> 01:50:03.532
- Well, suit yourself.
- Yeah, I will.

01:50:04.083 --> 01:50:05.275
Paul's a scaffolder.

01:50:05.375 --> 01:50:08.115
Yeah, your mum said.
Bet that's hard work, innit?

01:50:08.791 --> 01:50:10.941
- Can be, mate, yeah.
- Especially in the winter.

01:50:11.041 --> 01:50:12.449
That's right.

01:50:14.583 --> 01:50:16.816
I wanted to give it
a Mediterranean feel.

01:50:16.916 --> 01:50:18.275
Oh, it's a lovely kitchen.

01:50:18.375 --> 01:50:19.691
And this is the... Oops.

01:50:19.791 --> 01:50:21.191
Oh, that's a big lavatory.

01:50:21.291 --> 01:50:22.900
This is the downstairs toilet.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.066
Oh, that's handy, isn't it?
'Cause if you're in the garden...

01:50:25.166 --> 01:50:27.566
Exactly. It's really convenient.

01:50:27.666 --> 01:50:30.233
And I think the peach tones
make it quite tranquil.

01:50:30.333 --> 01:50:31.691
Yeah.

01:50:31.791 --> 01:50:34.191
So, you know where it is,
if you need it.

01:50:34.291 --> 01:50:36.150
Now... Excuse me, Jane.

01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:39.150
- This is the garage.
- I thought it was a cupboard.

01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:42.150
- Is that a new car?
- Yes. That's my car.

01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:44.275
What was the matter with your other one?

01:50:44.375 --> 01:50:47.115
Nothing. I'll show you upstairs.

01:50:53.458 --> 01:50:55.490
We'll start with this.

01:50:56.291 --> 01:50:58.150
Oh, there's the tank.

01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:01.150
- That's where I keep my towels, and bed linen.
- Just your airing cupboard.

01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:03.358
It's not very capacious.

01:51:03.458 --> 01:51:05.858
And this is Maurice's bathroom.

01:51:05.958 --> 01:51:07.983
It's green. Matches your tank.

01:51:08.083 --> 01:51:10.525
Are these all new carpets,
are they, sweetheart?

01:51:10.625 --> 01:51:12.074
Oh, yes.

01:51:13.375 --> 01:51:15.233
And this is the master bedroom.

01:51:15.333 --> 01:51:19.691
- Cor, it's more like the bridal suite.
- It's beautiful.

01:51:19.791 --> 01:51:21.733
I have always wanted a four-poster.

01:51:21.833 --> 01:51:24.775
I can see Maurice
thrashing about in there.

01:51:24.875 --> 01:51:26.025
It is a king-size.

01:51:26.125 --> 01:51:28.025
Ooh, it's like something
out of a fairy tale.

01:51:28.125 --> 01:51:29.816
Bet this cost a bob or two.

01:51:29.916 --> 01:51:31.358
Well, it certainly wasn't cheap.

01:51:31.458 --> 01:51:33.650
And here's another lavatory!

01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:35.816
Oh, that bathroom's mine, the en suite.

01:51:35.916 --> 01:51:39.066
You got the one each, have you?
That's nice, ain't it, Jane?

01:51:39.166 --> 01:51:40.233
It's like a hotel.

01:51:40.333 --> 01:51:42.441
You don't want to be
tripping over each other.

01:51:42.541 --> 01:51:45.199
Oh, you've got everything, Monica.

01:51:46.541 --> 01:51:49.108
- So, where's this friend, then?
- He's here, ain't he?

01:51:49.208 --> 01:51:51.108
No. Your mum's.

01:51:51.208 --> 01:51:52.441
What you talking about?

01:51:52.541 --> 01:51:55.400
She rang me at the shop, and asked me
if she could bring a friend from work.

01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.066
It's the first I've heard of it.

01:51:57.166 --> 01:51:58.358
- Is it?
- Yeah.

01:51:58.458 --> 01:52:00.108
- What, she's never mentioned it?
- No.

01:52:00.208 --> 01:52:01.449
Peculiar.

01:52:01.625 --> 01:52:04.650
That must be who she's
been going out with.

01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:07.199
She's a dark horse, isn't she?

01:52:11.375 --> 01:52:12.733
- Hello?
- No, I'm sorry.

01:52:12.833 --> 01:52:15.525
I'm a friend of Cynthia's.

01:52:15.625 --> 01:52:17.525
Yes. Oh, yes, of course.

01:52:17.625 --> 01:52:19.650
- Hello, sweetheart!
- Hello.

01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:22.941
- I thought you were...
- Come on in!

01:52:23.041 --> 01:52:25.400
- That's me mate, Hortense.
- Hi.

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:28.025
- That's me brother's wife.
- Oh, pleased to meet you.

01:52:28.125 --> 01:52:29.191
- Monica.
- Hello, Monica.

01:52:29.291 --> 01:52:32.108
Yeah, well, come on out the back,
meet me brother.

01:52:32.208 --> 01:52:33.532
Okay.

01:52:34.458 --> 01:52:35.900
Can I take your coat for you...

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.108
- Hortense.
- Hortense.

01:52:37.208 --> 01:52:38.782
Thank you.

01:52:41.291 --> 01:52:43.191
This is me little brother, Maurice.

01:52:43.291 --> 01:52:45.358
- Hello, pleased to meet you, Maurice.
- How do you do?

01:52:45.458 --> 01:52:48.358
Ain't that little, is he?
That's Hortense.

01:52:48.458 --> 01:52:49.775
- Hortense?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:52:49.875 --> 01:52:52.782
And this is me daughter, Roxanne.

01:52:52.958 --> 01:52:54.650
Oh, happy birthday.

01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:59.233
- Oh, you didn't have to do that, sweetheart!
- There you go. It's okay.

01:52:59.333 --> 01:53:00.983
That's Paul, her intended.

01:53:01.083 --> 01:53:02.150
He ain't me intended.

01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:03.650
- And this is...
- Pleased to meet you, Paul.

01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:05.608
- Jane.
- Maurice's assistant.

01:53:05.708 --> 01:53:07.108
- Hi. Oh, you, too.
- Very nice to meet you.

01:53:07.208 --> 01:53:09.483
- Oh, that's nice, ain't it, sweet?
- That's expensive.

01:53:09.583 --> 01:53:10.650
What would you like to drink,
red, white, rosé?

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:11.900
- White wine, please.
- You want to put that away.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.733
- Have that tomorrow.
- Thanks, that's really nice.

01:53:13.833 --> 01:53:15.858
- You're welcome.
- We'll have it later.

01:53:15.958 --> 01:53:17.400
No, don't waste it!

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:20.483
I've got some for later
to have with the cake.

01:53:20.583 --> 01:53:21.775
We thought you'd got lost.

01:53:21.875 --> 01:53:23.400
Well, I took a couple of wrong turns.

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:24.525
D'you come in a minicab, did you?

01:53:24.625 --> 01:53:25.650
- No, she's got a car.
- No, I drove.

01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:26.775
That's really nice, that. Thanks.

01:53:26.875 --> 01:53:27.900
- It's okay.
- There you go.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.025
- Thank you.
- Who wants a top-up?

01:53:29.125 --> 01:53:30.233
I'll have one with you, Maurice.

01:53:30.333 --> 01:53:32.358
- Not for me, thanks.
- You all right?

01:53:32.458 --> 01:53:33.775
- Would you like a crisp?
- Yeah, so far.

01:53:33.875 --> 01:53:34.900
- Good.
- Hortense?

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.191
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- No? No?

01:53:36.291 --> 01:53:39.316
I only met Paul
for the first time today, Hortense.

01:53:39.416 --> 01:53:41.191
- Really?
- He's a scaffolder.

01:53:41.291 --> 01:53:42.816
- Are ya?
- Yeah.

01:53:42.916 --> 01:53:44.691
- Another one bites the dust.
- Way!

01:53:44.791 --> 01:53:47.608
- That must be quite dangerous, Paul.
- Yeah, well, it can be.

01:53:47.708 --> 01:53:49.525
Here, come, and lollop over here.

01:53:49.625 --> 01:53:53.199
- Do you have to go up really high?
- Sometimes, yeah.

01:53:54.666 --> 01:53:56.441
Just you and the elements, really.

01:53:56.541 --> 01:53:58.483
Ever fallen off?

01:53:58.583 --> 01:54:00.233
- Would you like a crudité?
- Thank you, no.

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:02.157
- I think I'll wait till later.
- Oh, well.

01:54:02.583 --> 01:54:04.608
- So you work with my mum, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:54:04.708 --> 01:54:06.483
- Not on the machines?
- No.

01:54:06.583 --> 01:54:07.983
Are you coming round
tomorrow night, Paul?

01:54:08.083 --> 01:54:09.108
- Mum.
- Well, it's...

01:54:09.208 --> 01:54:10.525
We're going out.

01:54:10.625 --> 01:54:13.983
Well, you'll come round beforehand,
won't you? Have a drink? It's her 21 st.

01:54:14.083 --> 01:54:15.233
It's no big deal.

01:54:15.333 --> 01:54:17.316
Well, I ain't give you your present yet.

01:54:17.416 --> 01:54:19.324
Chicken drumsticks.

01:54:20.416 --> 01:54:22.150
- D'you want some salad, sweetheart?
- Yes, please.

01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:23.275
I'll get you some.

01:54:23.375 --> 01:54:24.525
- Are you doing something special...
- Thanks.

01:54:24.625 --> 01:54:27.150
- ...tomorrow night, you two? Oh.
- No, down the pub as usual.

01:54:27.250 --> 01:54:28.983
Oh, use fingers.

01:54:29.083 --> 01:54:31.483
Use what you like.
Use your feet if you want.

01:54:31.583 --> 01:54:34.191
- You've got a knife and fork there, Jane.
- It's a bit late now.

01:54:34.291 --> 01:54:35.608
What d'you do at the factory, then?

01:54:35.708 --> 01:54:37.483
This looks really lovely,
Maurice, thank you.

01:54:37.583 --> 01:54:38.733
I hope it doesn't kill you.

01:54:38.833 --> 01:54:40.400
There's salad servers there, Cynthia.

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.025
- You ain't her boss, are you?
- No.

01:54:42.125 --> 01:54:43.941
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

01:54:44.041 --> 01:54:45.983
- Do you want some salad, Paul?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

01:54:46.083 --> 01:54:47.525
It's good for you, make you go.

01:54:47.625 --> 01:54:49.525
He don't want none.

01:54:49.625 --> 01:54:51.941
What about Jane, does she want salad?

01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:53.990
Yeah, ta very much.

01:54:55.166 --> 01:54:56.566
What do you do, then, Roxanne?

01:54:56.666 --> 01:54:58.775
- I work for the Council.
- What, down the dole?

01:54:58.875 --> 01:55:00.400
- No. I'm a road sweeper.
- Wow.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:01.483
- Are ya?
- Yeah.

01:55:01.583 --> 01:55:03.941
- Who's for a potato?
- She's got my plate.

01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:05.608
- Here y'are, sweetheart.
- One for you, Hortense?

01:55:05.708 --> 01:55:07.025
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, I'll have some of that an' all.

01:55:07.125 --> 01:55:08.775
- Thank you.
- Please.

01:55:08.875 --> 01:55:11.650
Yeah, you do get girl road sweepers,
don't ya?

01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:13.816
- Right. Burgers and bangers.
- Nice one.

01:55:13.916 --> 01:55:15.650
Here, that's your one, Roxanne.

01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:17.650
That's the one with your name on it,
the burnt one, all right?

01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:18.775
Yeah.

01:55:18.875 --> 01:55:20.525
- Potato for you, Paul?
- Please.

01:55:20.625 --> 01:55:22.941
- There's a nice, big one.
- Here you are, darling.

01:55:23.041 --> 01:55:24.483
- One for you, pet.
- Ta.

01:55:24.583 --> 01:55:27.608
- Shall I do you, Monica?
- I can see to myself, thanks, Cynthia.

01:55:27.708 --> 01:55:28.941
Why don't you sit down?

01:55:29.041 --> 01:55:31.858
What about Maurice?
Who's lookin' after the worker?

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:33.608
Don't worry about me. I've been pickin'.

01:55:33.708 --> 01:55:34.691
- I'll eat in a minute.
- Oops, sorry.

01:55:34.791 --> 01:55:36.733
Your potato's on
your plate there, Cynthia.

01:55:36.833 --> 01:55:38.316
Think I'll have some salad.

01:55:38.416 --> 01:55:40.150
- Can I have my tongs back, please?
- Oh, sorry.

01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:41.941
- Got butter?
- Yes, just a minute.

01:55:42.041 --> 01:55:43.816
I'll have some mustard
while you're there, Monica.

01:55:43.916 --> 01:55:47.108
Oh, you like the American,
don't you, Roxanne?

01:55:47.208 --> 01:55:48.358
Yeah, ta.

01:55:48.458 --> 01:55:50.990
All right. Just get some salad.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.566
- Do you want some butter, Paul?
- You all right, darlin'?

01:55:54.666 --> 01:55:56.066
- Yeah. Just waiting for the butter.
- Please.

01:55:56.166 --> 01:55:57.275
There you go, Cynth.

01:55:57.375 --> 01:56:00.066
- Oh, Maurice!
- That'll shut you up.

01:56:00.166 --> 01:56:03.066
- Oh, you having a steak, are you, Cynthia?
- Thanks.

01:56:03.166 --> 01:56:04.441
Yes, thank you, Monica.

01:56:04.541 --> 01:56:07.574
Oh, well, that'll put hairs
on your chest.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.358
Like some mustard,
or would you prefer the French?

01:56:10.458 --> 01:56:12.316
This looks lovely, Maurice.

01:56:12.416 --> 01:56:14.066
- Right. There you go, mate.
- Do you want some of that?

01:56:14.166 --> 01:56:15.775
- Oh, thanks, darling.
- Half a cow for you.

01:56:15.875 --> 01:56:19.775
- Fuckin' hell! Look at the size of that!
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

01:56:19.875 --> 01:56:21.441
- There's enough there for all of us.
- Cheers.

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:23.483
That'll put some colour
in your cheeks, Paul.

01:56:23.583 --> 01:56:25.816
Right. You're sure no one else
wants a steak?

01:56:25.916 --> 01:56:28.066
- Well, ain't you having one?
- No, he's not, Cynthia.

01:56:28.166 --> 01:56:29.233
Not allowed.

01:56:29.333 --> 01:56:30.900
Would you like some mustard, Paul?

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.400
Oh, that's lovely.

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.608
Can't get rid of it, can ya?

01:56:34.708 --> 01:56:37.191
Oh, it's a real communal thing, eating.

01:56:37.291 --> 01:56:38.574
Yes.

01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:41.525
This is a lovely house.

01:56:41.625 --> 01:56:43.066
Well, we like it.

01:56:43.166 --> 01:56:46.275
- I'll show you round later, if you want.
- Yeah. Thanks, that'd be nice.

01:56:46.375 --> 01:56:48.365
Yeah. It's brilliant.

01:56:49.416 --> 01:56:51.733
- Do you live in a flat, then, Hortense?
- Yeah.

01:56:51.833 --> 01:56:54.400
Yeah, it's her own.
She's got a mortgage and everything.

01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:56.066
Whereabouts are you?

01:56:56.166 --> 01:56:57.699
Kilburn.

01:56:57.833 --> 01:56:59.150
That's a bit of a schlepp, innit?

01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:00.775
The Old Kent Road, and back every day?

01:57:00.875 --> 01:57:03.574
- I just get on the Tube.
- She drives!

01:57:03.958 --> 01:57:06.115
I drive to the station.

01:57:07.083 --> 01:57:09.233
- You've got a bedsit, ain't you, Paul?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:57:09.333 --> 01:57:12.608
- Oh, that's a shame.
- Wish I had a place of me own.

01:57:12.708 --> 01:57:14.316
Do you still live at home, then?

01:57:14.416 --> 01:57:15.816
No chance.

01:57:15.916 --> 01:57:18.233
So, do you two work on the same machine?

01:57:18.333 --> 01:57:21.566
No. I'm the only one on slits.

01:57:25.291 --> 01:57:27.108
Do you choose
your own working hours, then, Roxanne?

01:57:27.208 --> 01:57:28.191
Not bloody likely.

01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:30.358
Just biding her time
till you go to college, aren't you?

01:57:30.458 --> 01:57:33.775
- Oh, I ain't goin' to college.
- Hortense went to college.

01:57:33.875 --> 01:57:36.032
Oh, what did you study?

01:57:36.666 --> 01:57:37.900
Optometry.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.150
What's that, then?

01:57:39.250 --> 01:57:41.066
- It's to do with the eye, isn't it?
- That's right.

01:57:41.166 --> 01:57:43.032
Testing.

01:57:43.375 --> 01:57:45.525
And you've given it
all up now, have you?

01:57:45.625 --> 01:57:46.608
Not exactly.

01:57:46.708 --> 01:57:50.699
What are you doing working
in a cardboard box factory, then?

01:57:50.875 --> 01:57:52.816
- I'm doing research.
- Oh!

01:57:52.916 --> 01:57:56.199
That's interesting.
What sort of research?

01:57:56.333 --> 01:57:58.358
- Medical.
- What, you lookin' at her head?

01:57:59.666 --> 01:58:01.449
Take no notice.

01:58:02.458 --> 01:58:04.483
There's nothing wrong with her head.

01:58:04.583 --> 01:58:06.650
- D'you go to university?
- Yeah.

01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:08.608
- D'you do a degree?
- Yes, I did.

01:58:08.708 --> 01:58:10.816
She just looks at our eyes, don't you?

01:58:10.916 --> 01:58:13.615
- Yes, I do.
- What for?

01:58:13.958 --> 01:58:17.025
Well, you can tell a lot about people
from looking at their eyes.

01:58:17.125 --> 01:58:18.650
- That's true.
- Can you?

01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:20.566
Windows to your soul.

01:58:20.666 --> 01:58:22.358
That's a nice way of puttin' it, Jane.

01:58:22.458 --> 01:58:23.483
It's true, though, ain't it?

01:58:23.583 --> 01:58:25.400
Right. Who wants a top-up? Hortense?

01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:27.775
- No, thanks, I'm driving.
- Yes, please, sweetheart.

01:58:27.875 --> 01:58:29.150
- Here y'are, Maurice.
- Oi, greedy guts.

01:58:30.375 --> 01:58:34.108
You wanna take a leaf out of
her book, Paul. Lost his licence.

01:58:34.208 --> 01:58:35.608
All right, Mum.

01:58:35.708 --> 01:58:39.233
- Why, d'you have an accident, Paul?
- Just had one too many, that's all.

01:58:39.333 --> 01:58:40.441
- There you go.
- Oh, shame.

01:58:40.541 --> 01:58:42.066
The demon drink?

01:58:42.166 --> 01:58:43.775
Is that who you've been
going out with, then?

01:58:43.875 --> 01:58:45.157
Yes.

01:58:45.375 --> 01:58:48.233
She thought I'd been seeing a bloke.

01:58:48.333 --> 01:58:50.858
Could've been, I suppose.
I can still turn a few heads.

01:58:50.958 --> 01:58:53.150
Turn stomachs.

01:58:53.931 --> 01:58:55.115
Jane!

01:58:55.833 --> 01:58:57.066
It's gone off now.

01:58:57.166 --> 01:58:58.900
Here, do you want one, Hortense?

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.191
Oh, well, we might as well
pop the lot, then.

01:59:01.291 --> 01:59:02.858
No!

01:59:02.958 --> 01:59:04.240
Oh, it's like a bonfire.

01:59:04.875 --> 01:59:08.324
Happy birthday to you

01:59:08.791 --> 01:59:12.532
Happy birthday to you

01:59:13.208 --> 01:59:15.900
- Happy birthday, dear Roxy
- Happy birthday, dear stinker

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.441
Oh, yeah, Maurice, very funny!

01:59:17.541 --> 01:59:18.775
Happy birthday to you

01:59:18.875 --> 01:59:20.324
Join in!

01:59:22.791 --> 01:59:24.316
Nice one, champagne.

01:59:24.416 --> 01:59:26.191
Oh, I need my camera.
Did anybody bring it in?

01:59:26.291 --> 01:59:28.025
- I did. It's there, Monica.
- Do you have to, Monica?

01:59:28.125 --> 01:59:29.900
Of course I have to.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.275
Watch where you point that, Maurice.

01:59:31.375 --> 01:59:33.233
Right, all under cover, okay?

01:59:33.333 --> 01:59:34.983
- And, oops!
- Oh.

01:59:35.083 --> 01:59:36.691
- Yay!
- Come on...

01:59:36.791 --> 01:59:38.108
- Blow your candles out, Roxanne.
- Oh.

01:59:38.208 --> 01:59:40.566
- Everybody else gather round. Come on.
- Come on, darlin'.

01:59:40.666 --> 01:59:42.733
All right, Cynth,
you tuck in there. Okay?

01:59:42.833 --> 01:59:45.025
Hortense in there.
Right, come round here, Paul.

01:59:45.125 --> 01:59:46.775
Hurry up, it's burning me eyebrows off.

01:59:46.875 --> 01:59:48.691
Right, make a wish. One big blow.

01:59:48.791 --> 01:59:50.358
- And...
- Cheese!

01:59:50.458 --> 01:59:51.740
Hey!

01:59:52.333 --> 01:59:54.199
I hope your wish comes true, pet.

01:59:54.333 --> 01:59:55.941
- Here you are, Roxy.
- Ta.

01:59:56.041 --> 01:59:58.191
- All right, Cynth.
- There you are, sweetheart.

01:59:58.291 --> 02:00:00.733
- Oh, that's nice.
- And Paul.

02:00:00.833 --> 02:00:03.525
- Jane.
- All right. Cynth, again.

02:00:03.625 --> 02:00:05.400
Thank you, Maurice.

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:06.858
Oh, this is livin', ain't it?

02:00:06.958 --> 02:00:08.650
Ooh, yeah.

02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:10.691
Okay. One for me.

02:00:10.791 --> 02:00:12.282
All right.

02:00:13.916 --> 02:00:15.233
On you go, then.

02:00:15.333 --> 02:00:17.949
Oh, yeah, okay.

02:00:20.041 --> 02:00:22.400
I would like to propose a toast...

02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:25.532
For Roxanne on her 21 st birthday.

02:00:26.208 --> 02:00:29.615
Now, it's all legal,
and twice as boring for it.

02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:32.150
Mind you, it's been legal
since you I were 18, anyway,

02:00:32.250 --> 02:00:33.858
so I don't know what I'm talking about.

02:00:33.958 --> 02:00:35.775
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Ta.

02:00:35.875 --> 02:00:37.074
Roxanne...

02:00:38.375 --> 02:00:39.657
Happy birthday.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.650
- There you go.
- What's that?

02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:50.240
- Book token.
- Don't be stupid.

02:00:53.916 --> 02:00:55.699
Fuckin' hell, Maurice.

02:00:55.833 --> 02:00:56.983
Thanks!

02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:58.358
Oh, well, it's your 21 st, isn't it?

02:00:58.458 --> 02:01:00.441
Thanks, Monica.

02:01:00.541 --> 02:01:02.490
Happy birthday, pet.

02:01:03.041 --> 02:01:04.941
Don't spend it all in the one shop.

02:01:05.041 --> 02:01:06.532
Here, happy birthday.

02:01:07.166 --> 02:01:09.407
Wish I'd brought my present with me now.

02:01:09.916 --> 02:01:12.358
You can give it to her tomorrow, can't you?
That's her birthday.

02:01:12.458 --> 02:01:14.358
Yeah. I don't expect I shall
see her tomorrow.

02:01:14.458 --> 02:01:16.949
Are you gonna sit down, darlin'?

02:01:17.083 --> 02:01:18.900
Yes, come and sit down.
Everybody, have some cake.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.233
- There you are. Hortense? Jane?
- Everybody, get stuck in.

02:01:21.333 --> 02:01:22.441
Where am I going?

02:01:22.541 --> 02:01:24.865
Anywhere you like.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.407
- Come on the end, Paul.
- Hortense.

02:01:34.458 --> 02:01:35.699
Where's the bathroom?

02:01:36.208 --> 02:01:37.733
It's just through there, sweetheart.

02:01:37.833 --> 02:01:38.983
Yeah, it's the door straight ahead,

02:01:39.083 --> 02:01:41.615
- and the light's on the left.
- Thank you. Yeah.

02:02:07.208 --> 02:02:08.449
She's a nice girl.

02:02:09.833 --> 02:02:11.824
Yeah, she is, Maurice.

02:02:12.458 --> 02:02:14.824
- Seems very pleasant.
- Yeah, she's all right.

02:02:15.333 --> 02:02:16.900
- How are you doing, Paul?
- All right.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.240
- Oh, has your shirt dried off now?
- Yeah, it's fine.

02:02:23.958 --> 02:02:25.865
She takes after her mother.

02:02:26.791 --> 02:02:29.990
- Does she?
- D'you know her as well?

02:02:31.041 --> 02:02:33.949
Work at the factory, does she?

02:02:34.625 --> 02:02:36.324
You're lookin' at her.

02:02:38.375 --> 02:02:40.240
She's my daughter.

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:47.949
What's the matter with ya?

02:02:48.416 --> 02:02:50.066
Maurice...

02:02:50.166 --> 02:02:52.115
It's me daughter.

02:02:53.125 --> 02:02:54.907
Don't be stupid.

02:02:55.708 --> 02:02:57.816
She's had too much to drink.

02:03:01.708 --> 02:03:03.240
She can't be the one that...

02:03:06.875 --> 02:03:08.115
What?

02:03:09.958 --> 02:03:12.157
Hortense, sweetheart...

02:03:13.833 --> 02:03:16.370
She's your sister.

02:03:19.583 --> 02:03:20.907
What?

02:03:22.333 --> 02:03:25.074
That's her half-sister, Paul!

02:03:36.291 --> 02:03:39.199
- You eat your cake, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

02:03:40.333 --> 02:03:42.740
- What's the matter?
- I'm all right, darlin'.

02:03:48.333 --> 02:03:49.865
I told 'em.

02:03:56.333 --> 02:03:58.907
Tell 'em who you are, sweetheart.

02:04:02.958 --> 02:04:04.907
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

02:04:05.083 --> 02:04:08.365
Yeah, well, it has, ain't it,
so you tell 'em. Go on.

02:04:12.625 --> 02:04:14.240
Is it true?

02:04:14.541 --> 02:04:16.074
Yes, it is.

02:04:18.666 --> 02:04:22.449
- You never told her, then?
- I'm sorry, darlin'.

02:04:23.458 --> 02:04:25.650
Will someone tell me
what the fuck's goin' on?

02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:27.907
She's your sister!

02:04:31.166 --> 02:04:32.365
Maurice?

02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:36.949
Monica?

02:04:38.791 --> 02:04:41.490
I always said she had a right to know.

02:04:44.041 --> 02:04:46.983
Look, Roxanne, sweetheart!
Darlin', darlin', please!

02:04:47.083 --> 02:04:50.775
Don't you touch me, or I will smack you,
you slag! You fucking slag!

02:04:50.875 --> 02:04:53.941
Ain't it enough you had one bastard?
You had to have two and all?

02:04:54.041 --> 02:04:57.407
Stop it! Roxanne? Roxy?

02:04:58.916 --> 02:05:01.358
Sit down, darlin'. Sit down, Paul.

02:05:06.958 --> 02:05:08.316
Cynthia, I think I should go.

02:05:08.416 --> 02:05:11.865
No, I don't want you to go, darlin'.
You sit down.

02:05:12.708 --> 02:05:14.699
Eat your cake, Jane.

02:05:14.958 --> 02:05:17.115
You don't half-choose
your moments, Cynthia.

02:05:17.416 --> 02:05:21.240
Well, when's the right moment, Maurice?
You tell me that.

02:05:22.333 --> 02:05:24.150
- Paul, get my coat. We're going.
- Oh, don't go.

02:05:24.250 --> 02:05:26.191
- Why didn't you tell me, Maurice?
- I thought you knew.

02:05:26.291 --> 02:05:28.233
- You used to tell me everything!
- I'm sorry.

02:05:28.333 --> 02:05:31.150
- Well, you've fuckin' well let me down!
- Oh, don't say that.

02:05:31.250 --> 02:05:33.566
As for you, well,
thanks for the present!

02:05:33.666 --> 02:05:36.733
You've ruined my party,
and I hope you're happy!

02:05:36.833 --> 02:05:38.740
Roxy... Roxanne?

02:06:00.083 --> 02:06:01.740
She don't mean it, darlin'.

02:06:02.541 --> 02:06:04.407
She's just little bit upset.

02:06:22.208 --> 02:06:23.949
- Where are you goin'?
- I don't know.

02:06:25.958 --> 02:06:28.816
It's all been a bit of a shock, innit?

02:06:28.916 --> 02:06:30.824
Look, I don't get it.
Did you know about her?

02:06:32.416 --> 02:06:34.240
I always thought she'd had a boy.

02:06:34.583 --> 02:06:36.733
- She's a slag. Yes, she fuckin' is!
- No, she's not.

02:06:36.833 --> 02:06:39.240
She loves ya. We all love ya.

02:06:40.583 --> 02:06:42.400
- You coming back?
- No.

02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:43.733
- You got to.
- Why should I?

02:06:43.833 --> 02:06:44.816
You gotta face up to it.

02:06:44.916 --> 02:06:46.699
Face up to what?

02:06:51.875 --> 02:06:54.240
She's left her card.

02:06:54.958 --> 02:06:57.990
Oh, well, I'll post it on to her.

02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:00.574
I'll take it.

02:07:00.958 --> 02:07:03.525
The state she's in, you'll be lucky
if you ever see her again.

02:07:03.625 --> 02:07:05.983
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you, sweetheart?

02:07:06.083 --> 02:07:07.108
Would I?

02:07:07.208 --> 02:07:10.615
You've been workin' at it
for 18 years, ain't you, Monica?

02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:14.066
You turned my father against me.

02:07:14.166 --> 02:07:16.441
You turned my Maurice against me,

02:07:16.541 --> 02:07:18.358
and you turned me daughter against me.

02:07:18.458 --> 02:07:21.240
You'll be havin' a go
at her next, I expect.

02:07:21.416 --> 02:07:24.691
I'm sorry about this, Hortense.
You finished now, Jane?

02:07:24.791 --> 02:07:26.108
Why don't you sit down?

02:07:26.208 --> 02:07:28.650
You got a short memory, ain't ya?

02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:30.066
What are you talkin' about now?

02:07:30.166 --> 02:07:31.233
You wouldn't have none of this

02:07:31.333 --> 02:07:34.150
if I hadn't given Maurice
the money to start with!

02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:35.775
That money wasn't yours to give!

02:07:35.875 --> 02:07:38.900
- That was your father's insurance money!
- That money was for me and Roxanne.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.025
And Maurice!

02:07:40.125 --> 02:07:42.775
He didn't want none of it
till he come home and talked to you!

02:07:42.875 --> 02:07:44.358
He was entitled to it!

02:07:44.458 --> 02:07:47.025
I was going out cleaning
at 5:00 in the morning,

02:07:47.125 --> 02:07:48.650
coming home, taking her to school!

02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:50.858
And then going out again
to do a full day's work!

02:07:50.958 --> 02:07:52.358
And didn't we know it!

02:07:52.458 --> 02:07:56.191
You've done nothing but spend his money
since the day you clapped eyes on him!

02:07:56.291 --> 02:07:59.191
Well, what are you supposed to do
with money but spend it?

02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:01.108
At least we've made
something of ourselves!

02:08:01.208 --> 02:08:02.525
Oh, haven't you just...

02:08:02.625 --> 02:08:05.824
You want to try bringing up
a kid on your own!

02:08:13.125 --> 02:08:16.358
She can't help it.
She's never had enough love.

02:08:16.458 --> 02:08:17.483
And you've never got on.

02:08:17.583 --> 02:08:20.407
- That ain't my fault.
- I know, I know.

02:08:21.125 --> 02:08:22.990
But she needs ya.

02:08:23.833 --> 02:08:26.074
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

02:08:27.041 --> 02:08:29.100
What do you think, Paul?

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.275
I think he's right, darling.

02:08:31.375 --> 02:08:32.733
Do you?

02:08:32.833 --> 02:08:34.199
Yeah.

02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:37.025
Well, I ain't sayin' nothin'.

02:08:37.125 --> 02:08:38.733
You won't have to.

02:08:38.833 --> 02:08:41.449
You just have to listen. Come on.

02:08:57.750 --> 02:09:00.115
I'm sorry, Roxanne.

02:09:00.833 --> 02:09:03.074
It just came out, darlin'.

02:09:03.541 --> 02:09:05.733
I didn't mean to spoil your party.

02:09:05.833 --> 02:09:08.441
- Tell her, Maurice!
- Now, leave her alone, Cynth.

02:09:08.541 --> 02:09:09.907
Just tell her the truth.

02:09:12.083 --> 02:09:13.574
Darlin'...

02:09:16.666 --> 02:09:19.615
I got pregnant when I was 15.

02:09:21.083 --> 02:09:25.324
And your granddad sent me away
to this place, didn't he, Maurice?

02:09:26.291 --> 02:09:29.990
I didn't know she was
gonna come lookin' for me, did I?

02:09:31.458 --> 02:09:33.316
But I gotta tell you the truth, darlin',

02:09:33.416 --> 02:09:35.282
I'm glad she did.

02:09:36.666 --> 02:09:40.025
It ain't her fault, sweetheart!
She didn't even wanna come!

02:09:40.125 --> 02:09:43.365
She didn't wanna hurt you,
no more than I did!

02:09:44.583 --> 02:09:46.400
Oh, you tell her, sweetheart.

02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:49.549
It's true. She didn't wanna upset you.

02:09:51.595 --> 02:09:52.824
I'm sorry.

02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:58.282
All right?

02:10:00.041 --> 02:10:02.449
She said you weren't
never gonna come back.

02:10:03.791 --> 02:10:05.608
Who did?

02:10:05.708 --> 02:10:08.900
I never said any such thing.
She's twisted everything as usual.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.233
Yes, you did, Monica.

02:10:11.333 --> 02:10:12.775
Well, you was wrong, wasn't ya?

02:10:12.875 --> 02:10:15.775
'Cause she has come back,
ain't you, sweetheart?

02:10:15.875 --> 02:10:18.657
I always thought
you should've known, Roxanne.

02:10:19.125 --> 02:10:20.233
You should've told her, Cynth.

02:10:20.333 --> 02:10:22.733
Of course I should've told her, Maurice.

02:10:22.833 --> 02:10:26.483
But I didn't think
there was ever gonna be no need to.

02:10:26.583 --> 02:10:28.941
You seem to have told all and sundry.

02:10:29.041 --> 02:10:30.983
Meaning me, I suppose.

02:10:31.083 --> 02:10:33.358
And why shouldn't he?
I am his wife, after all!

02:10:33.458 --> 02:10:35.608
Then why don't you behave like his wife?

02:10:35.708 --> 02:10:36.733
What?

02:10:36.833 --> 02:10:38.483
Why ain't you give him no kids?

02:10:38.583 --> 02:10:40.983
- Be quiet, Cynthia.
- That's between Maurice and me.

02:10:41.083 --> 02:10:43.941
You're so selfish, Monica.
You might not've wanted them,

02:10:44.041 --> 02:10:45.066
- but he did.
- Shut up, Mum!

02:10:45.166 --> 02:10:46.400
You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:47.691
- Don't I?
- There's things

02:10:47.791 --> 02:10:49.157
- you know nothing about.
- Maurice.

02:10:49.333 --> 02:10:50.865
Like what?

02:10:56.333 --> 02:10:57.532
Tell her.

02:11:02.291 --> 02:11:03.490
Tell me what?

02:11:05.291 --> 02:11:07.407
Why can't you tell her?

02:11:14.041 --> 02:11:17.532
She can't have kids. Simple as that.

02:11:18.333 --> 02:11:21.574
She's physically incapable
of having children.

02:11:22.416 --> 02:11:25.316
We've had every test
known to medical science.

02:11:25.416 --> 02:11:28.108
She's been pushed around,
prodded, poked, had operations.

02:11:28.208 --> 02:11:31.740
We've had 15 years of it,
and she can't have a baby.

02:11:33.125 --> 02:11:35.115
I love you to bits...

02:11:36.458 --> 02:11:40.782
But it's almost destroyed our relationship.
You know it has.

02:11:44.875 --> 02:11:46.365
There...

02:11:47.625 --> 02:11:49.449
I've said it.

02:11:50.541 --> 02:11:53.157
So where's the bolt of lightning?

02:11:56.791 --> 02:11:58.657
Secrets and lies.

02:12:00.791 --> 02:12:04.949
We're all in pain.
Why can't we share our pain?

02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:10.191
I've spent my entire life
trying to make people happy!

02:12:10.291 --> 02:12:13.900
And the three people I love the most
in the world hate each other's guts!

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.199
I'm in the middle,
I can't take it any more!

02:12:27.416 --> 02:12:28.782
I'm sorry, Hortense.

02:12:29.458 --> 02:12:31.150
You are a very brave person.

02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:34.115
- A very stupid person.
- No, you're not.

02:12:35.041 --> 02:12:36.066
You wanted to find the truth

02:12:36.166 --> 02:12:39.490
and you were prepared
to suffer the consequences.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.824
And I admire you for that. I mean it.

02:13:23.833 --> 02:13:26.074
You are so lucky, Cynthia.

02:13:40.625 --> 02:13:42.816
So you'd really been working
in the factory?

02:13:42.916 --> 02:13:44.199
No.

02:13:45.833 --> 02:13:47.025
What do you do, then?

02:13:47.125 --> 02:13:48.907
I'm an optometrist.

02:13:53.541 --> 02:13:55.157
Welcome to the family.

02:14:01.606 --> 02:14:05.990
Maurice...
I wish I'd had a dad like you.

02:14:07.333 --> 02:14:09.032
You're lovely.

02:14:18.833 --> 02:14:21.282
His name's Bingham.

02:14:22.333 --> 02:14:24.032
Your father.

02:14:25.916 --> 02:14:27.782
He's from America.

02:14:30.041 --> 02:14:33.074
I met him on holiday. Benidorm.

02:14:34.458 --> 02:14:36.574
He's a medical student.

02:14:39.333 --> 02:14:43.199
And one morning I come down,
and he wasn't there no more.

02:14:45.333 --> 02:14:47.449
But he was a nice man.

02:14:50.083 --> 02:14:51.490
He was.

02:15:00.458 --> 02:15:02.657
Was my father a nice man?

02:15:03.875 --> 02:15:06.740
Oh, don't break my heart, darlin'.

02:15:34.208 --> 02:15:35.907
I'm all right.

02:15:54.291 --> 02:15:57.365
Oh, please, Roxanne, sweetheart!

02:15:57.958 --> 02:15:59.824
Please!

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.699
I'm frightened.

02:16:13.708 --> 02:16:14.990
Why?

02:16:17.458 --> 02:16:19.782
You don't love me any more.

02:16:22.166 --> 02:16:24.199
Not like you used to.

02:16:27.291 --> 02:16:28.907
Maurice...

02:16:34.333 --> 02:16:37.031
You don't know how much I love you.

02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:40.699
Do you?

02:16:55.125 --> 02:16:57.740
We've got each other, haven't we?

02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:16.082
Bet you've never seen
so much shit, have you?

02:17:16.182 --> 02:17:18.156
You wanna see my mum's house.

02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:21.531
Do you miss her?

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.365
Yeah.

02:17:24.375 --> 02:17:25.400
Did you get on with her?

02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:27.275
She used to drive me mad.

02:17:27.375 --> 02:17:29.025
That's what they're there for,
though, ain't it?

02:17:29.125 --> 02:17:30.449
Yeah.

02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:34.199
That's me old chair there.

02:17:34.458 --> 02:17:36.574
I always wanted a little sister.

02:17:38.415 --> 02:17:41.191
No, it's just that my brothers
were much older than me.

02:17:41.290 --> 02:17:43.191
So I ended up playing on my own
most of the time.

02:17:43.290 --> 02:17:45.449
Oh, I know what you mean.

02:17:51.375 --> 02:17:53.365
What you laughing at?

02:17:55.833 --> 02:17:58.281
Do you feel like we're sisters?

02:17:58.833 --> 02:18:01.449
I don't know. Do you?

02:18:04.583 --> 02:18:06.740
- It's a bit weird.
- Yeah.

02:18:07.290 --> 02:18:10.400
- I don't mind it, though.
- No, nor do... Nor do I.

02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:13.074
I don't even know you yet, do I?

02:18:14.375 --> 02:18:15.858
D'you wanna go out one night?

02:18:15.958 --> 02:18:17.865
Yeah, yeah.

02:18:18.875 --> 02:18:20.358
You can take me to one of your pubs.

02:18:20.458 --> 02:18:22.615
Yeah, all right.

02:18:24.708 --> 02:18:26.531
How would you introduce me?

02:18:27.333 --> 02:18:28.699
As your half-sister?

02:18:29.083 --> 02:18:30.490
Yeah.

02:18:32.208 --> 02:18:34.691
No, man. Too much explaining to do.

02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:36.233
- That's what I'd say, though.
- Would ya?

02:18:36.333 --> 02:18:37.574
Yeah.

02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:40.983
Yeah. Best to tell the truth, innit?

02:18:41.083 --> 02:18:42.699
Yeah, it is.

02:18:43.290 --> 02:18:45.574
That way nobody gets hurt.

02:18:49.833 --> 02:18:52.449
Here y'are, sweetheart. Tea's up.

02:18:53.125 --> 02:18:54.865
Go on, darlin'.

02:18:55.125 --> 02:18:57.150
- Want a biscuit?
- No, I'm all right, thank you.

02:18:57.250 --> 02:18:59.275
Well, sit yourself down.

02:18:59.375 --> 02:19:02.115
- Are you all right with that?
- Yeah.

02:19:03.083 --> 02:19:04.615
That's it.

02:19:09.833 --> 02:19:11.990
Who'd have thought it?

02:19:13.290 --> 02:19:16.650
Look at you two, sittin' there
like a couple garden gnomes.

02:19:24.333 --> 02:19:26.124
Oh, this is the life, ain't it?

02:19:26.125 --> 02:19:27.699
Yeah.
