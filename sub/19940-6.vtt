00:06.570 --> 00:10.070
MIDGE:
The one that got away.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.400
The biggest heartache
of my life was not

00:12.450 --> 00:15.070
my husband and the father
of my children leaving me,

00:15.120 --> 00:19.950
it was never being able to
truly land Manniford McClaine.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.200
(group chuckling)

00:21.250 --> 00:23.170
Yes, that was his real name,

00:23.210 --> 00:25.080
and he was fabulous.

00:25.130 --> 00:27.670
He was the captain of
my high school football team.

00:27.710 --> 00:29.800
He was the leader of the pack.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.970
He had a jawline you could
stab your sister with.

00:32.009 --> 00:34.180
-(laughter)
-He was so gorgeous that

00:34.220 --> 00:35.840
after years of having
my mother tell me,

00:35.890 --> 00:38.220
"Your virtue is a garden,
keep it watered,

00:38.260 --> 00:39.930
but behind a fence,"

00:39.970 --> 00:41.810
I bring him over for dinner,
she takes one look at him,

00:41.850 --> 00:43.060
and suddenly it's like,
"You know what?

00:43.100 --> 00:44.310
"It's not a high fence.

00:44.350 --> 00:45.900
-"Just hop on over.
-(laughter)

00:45.940 --> 00:48.230
Here, step on my hands,
I'll give you a boost."

00:48.270 --> 00:50.230
-(laughter) -We almost
went to prom together.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.820
-ALL: Ooh!
-As friends, but still.

00:53.860 --> 00:56.910
Then his old girlfriend, Satan,
moved back from Rhode Island

00:56.950 --> 00:58.910
and they got back together,
got married,

00:58.950 --> 01:01.160
had four kids
and bought a waterfront mansion

01:01.200 --> 01:02.410
-in Oyster Bay.
-ALL: Ooh!

01:02.450 --> 01:03.660
Yes. And...

01:03.710 --> 01:05.040
Hey, is there any more
onion dip?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.170
ALL:
Shh!

01:06.210 --> 01:07.580
Sorry.

01:07.630 --> 01:08.960
(whispers):
Is there any more onion dip?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.920
-(laughter)
-Continue, please.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.880
Anyhow, the other day
I picked up a newspaper

01:13.920 --> 01:15.970
and there on the front page
is a headline:

01:16.010 --> 01:19.890
"Wall Street golden boy,
Manniford McClaine,

01:19.930 --> 01:24.350
caught with head of wife
in trunk of car."

01:24.390 --> 01:25.310
(all gasping)

01:25.350 --> 01:27.020
That's right.

01:27.060 --> 01:28.520
Manniford murdered his wife,

01:28.560 --> 01:30.020
then drove around
with her head for an hour

01:30.070 --> 01:31.610
before getting caught.
I couldn't believe it.

01:31.650 --> 01:34.110
It-it had to be some other
Manniford McClaine.

01:34.150 --> 01:36.450
But there he was,
in the paper, handcuffed,

01:36.490 --> 01:37.990
being perp-walked
into the station.

01:38.030 --> 01:40.740
And I just thought, "My God...

01:40.780 --> 01:43.160
he still looks fantastic."

01:43.200 --> 01:45.250
-(laughter)
-No, I mean it,

01:45.290 --> 01:47.870
better looking than high school.
I know,

01:47.920 --> 01:50.090
my first thought should've been,
"Dodged that bullet."

01:50.130 --> 01:54.630
Instead it was, "I don't know,
he's single, I'm single.

01:54.670 --> 01:56.800
If he beats this thing..."

01:56.840 --> 01:59.510
-(laughter) -Okay,
I'm gonna stop talking now.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.510
Harriet's brother is supposed
to play something for us.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.220
Tommy? Play me off!

02:03.270 --> 02:04.930
(cheering and applause)

02:04.980 --> 02:06.230
(piano playing)

02:06.270 --> 02:08.270
Thank you.
(laughs)

02:08.310 --> 02:10.020
Oh. Thanks.

02:11.570 --> 02:12.820

Letty dumped him days ago.

03:42.110 --> 03:43.620
My name, well, it's Ay-Rolf--

03:43.660 --> 03:45.160
that's the first name--

03:45.200 --> 03:46.410
"Jawohl," that's it.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.080
-Not very common.
-Ay-Rolf.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.330
Uh, and your last name?

03:49.370 --> 03:50.500
Hitler... burg.

03:50.540 --> 03:51.790
-(laughter)
-MIDGE: Well,

03:51.830 --> 03:53.750
I've got to tell you,
Mr. Ay-Rolf Hitlerburg,

03:53.790 --> 03:56.380
you're a pretty long way
from the Reichstag.

03:56.420 --> 03:59.090
Well, that bitch Himmler sent me
off completely unprepared.

03:59.130 --> 04:00.340
Did I say "Himmler"?

04:00.380 --> 04:01.880
I meant "Himmlerstein."

04:01.930 --> 04:03.260
Well, what were his directions?

04:03.300 --> 04:05.140
He said to take a left,
and another left,

04:05.180 --> 04:06.720
-and then the Third Reich.
-"Right."

04:06.760 --> 04:07.970
That's what I said:
"Third Reich."

04:08.010 --> 04:10.020
-"Right."
-Glad you agree.

04:10.060 --> 04:11.850
-(laughter)
-MIDGE: Well,

04:11.890 --> 04:13.520
you are a long way
from the fatherland.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.940
Was is das?

04:15.980 --> 04:17.940
Your German vocabulary's quite
impressive, by the way.

04:17.980 --> 04:20.860
-Danke.
-You are in New York City.

04:20.899 --> 04:23.030
New York City, interesting.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.320
Any place you can recommend
for a quick bite to eat?

04:25.370 --> 04:27.030
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.080
Oh, well, there's an excellent
deli around the corner.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.000
-Yeah, deli's not really
my thing. -(laughter)

04:32.040 --> 04:33.330
Okay, what do you like?

04:33.370 --> 04:35.460
Whatever's fascist. Fastest!

04:35.500 --> 04:37.040
Oy, what a day this has been.

04:37.090 --> 04:38.590

04:38.630 --> 04:40.880

-Pizza's here! Everybody pay up!

04:40.920 --> 04:43.170
(applause, Midge laughs)

04:43.220 --> 04:44.680
So, I'm not really
Ay-Rolf Hitlerburg.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.180
Well, you had me fooled.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.100
I'm Randall,
Vivian's fifth favorite cousin.

04:48.140 --> 04:49.470
Midge,
Vivian's 34th best friend.

04:49.510 --> 04:50.720
VIVIAN:
My what?

04:50.770 --> 04:52.100
Nothing.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.270
-Couple of comedians.
-Are you?

04:54.310 --> 04:55.560
-Am I what?
-A comedian?

04:55.600 --> 04:57.110
Oh, bad sign if you can't tell.

04:57.150 --> 04:59.110
-No, you're hysterical.
-I'll take your pity.

04:59.150 --> 05:01.280
Yes, I've been at it a while.
Almost made my living from it.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.820
Got an agent, got a manager,
toured, did a little TV.

05:04.860 --> 05:06.820
(scoffs)
In fact, I got to go.

05:06.870 --> 05:09.950
-I got a set downtown
in a half hour. -Oh.

05:09.990 --> 05:11.620
Crappy time slot, but, oh, well.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.710
-You ever try a brisket?
-A brisket?

05:13.750 --> 05:15.080
Personal joke.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.210
See you again.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.420
And don't be funny without me.

05:17.460 --> 05:18.960
(chuckles)

05:19.000 --> 05:20.840
You can't have Randall,
I'm in love with him.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.380
He's your cousin, Vivian.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.920

I've never worn
much makeup before.

06:08.260 --> 06:09.510

06:09.550 --> 06:11.640
Blue would be a wonderful color
on you.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.060
I don't know.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.230
-Which one is that again?
-Mermaid Ice.

06:15.270 --> 06:16.680
Would you like to try it on?

06:16.730 --> 06:17.890
-I don't know.
-Here.

06:17.940 --> 06:21.020
My daughter said
I should try more.

06:21.060 --> 06:23.020
She says I should live a little
before it's all over.

06:23.070 --> 06:24.280
Before what's all over?

06:24.320 --> 06:26.360
My life.
She said it's a failure.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.320
I don't participate; that's why
my husband won't talk to me.

06:30.370 --> 06:32.990
She's been very outspoken
since she went to Radcliffe.

06:33.030 --> 06:34.290
-(Susie sighs)
-There.

06:34.330 --> 06:36.370
What do you think?

06:36.410 --> 06:37.960
I don't know.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.040
Excuse me, is that Mermaid Ice?

06:40.080 --> 06:42.420
I'm sorry, I'm in a big hurry.
My man's coming over

06:42.460 --> 06:44.000
and I am all out
of my Mermaid Ice eye shadow.

06:44.050 --> 06:45.380
And if I am not wearing that
when he gets home,

06:45.420 --> 06:46.380
all hell breaks loose.

06:46.420 --> 06:48.550
-Really?
-You kidding?

06:48.590 --> 06:50.050
I couldn't get him
to give me the time of day,

06:50.090 --> 06:52.100
much less give me the,
you know, time of day.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.350
And then I came in here--

06:53.390 --> 06:54.680
-you remember
when I came in here? -I do.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.140
You came in here
and we talked about...

06:56.180 --> 06:58.640
I told you my life was crap,
you sold me the Mermaid Ice,

06:58.690 --> 07:01.230
and now my life
is a fat, fuzzy peach.

07:01.270 --> 07:03.730
I mean, I-I'm going broke 'cause
this stuff costs a fortune,

07:03.770 --> 07:05.070
but, man, is it worth it.

07:05.110 --> 07:06.480
-Well, my goodness.
-Yeah.

07:06.530 --> 07:08.070
If it worked for you...

07:08.110 --> 07:09.990
I'll take two.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.160
Wonderful.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.660
You will not be sorry.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.280
Margo, would you mind
ringing up Mrs. Winters

07:14.330 --> 07:16.620
while I help my return customer
over here?

07:16.660 --> 07:19.660
MARGO: Hello,
I can help you right here.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.170
Well, well, well.

07:21.210 --> 07:22.500
Just call me the closer.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.840
I'm a little surprised
to see you.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.260
Well, it's been a while
and last time we...

07:28.300 --> 07:29.760
words were said and...

07:31.550 --> 07:33.760
So, you're sorry?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.810
-Sure.
-Good.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.180
It's behind us.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.850
So, this is where
you hang out now?

07:38.890 --> 07:40.100
Well, you know
I never like to be

07:40.140 --> 07:41.640
more than three feet
from a lipstick.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.900
-I do. -It's a good job.
The girls are really nice.

07:43.940 --> 07:45.650
And there's a vending machine
in the employee break room

07:45.690 --> 07:47.860
that's broken, so if you hit it
just right, free Abba-Zabas.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.240
-Mm, you are living the dream.
-Sorry to interrupt.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.110
Midge, my parents
are making me throw them

07:52.160 --> 07:54.030
a 25th anniversary party Friday.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.830
-Friday? Short notice.
-I know.

07:55.870 --> 07:58.290
And I have no idea what people
of their age do at parties.

07:58.330 --> 08:00.040
My mom keeps saying
the word canapés.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.080
Is that an old people's dance?

08:01.120 --> 08:03.080
It's a type of hors d'œuvre.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.170
You always know everything,
so any tips would help.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.420
Hire help.

08:06.460 --> 08:07.840
-And get chairs, lots of chairs.
-Right.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.090
Old people sit.

08:09.130 --> 08:10.220
MIDGE:
And invite some of your friends

08:10.260 --> 08:11.470
for a little moral support.

08:11.510 --> 08:13.640
Who the hell would want to come
to something like this?

08:13.680 --> 08:14.970
I'll come.

08:15.010 --> 08:16.220
You will?

08:16.260 --> 08:17.310
Oh, my God, I love you.

08:17.350 --> 08:19.180
I love her.

08:19.220 --> 08:20.810
Ha.

08:20.850 --> 08:22.980
-Booked a gig.
-I'm sorry, what?

08:23.020 --> 08:24.350
It's just this thing
that I've been doing lately.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.860
I've been working
the party circuit.

08:25.900 --> 08:26.980
Which means...?

08:27.020 --> 08:28.940
I go to parties and I talk.

08:28.980 --> 08:31.400
-As opposed to...?
-People like to hear me talk.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.450
And so far, it's been young
parties, Viv's age.

08:33.490 --> 08:35.110
I haven't really worked
an older crowd yet,

08:35.159 --> 08:36.530
so this is
a perfect opportunity.

08:36.570 --> 08:38.530
I'll-I'll have to adjust
a few of my references,

08:38.580 --> 08:40.539
but you have to be able
to read an audience, right?

08:40.580 --> 08:41.960
Uh-huh.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.710
Uh, hey, are there large
quantities of narcotics

08:43.750 --> 08:44.920
in these Abba-Zabas of yours?

08:44.960 --> 08:46.210
I can't explain. I...

08:46.250 --> 08:47.710
Just-just come and you'll see.
Friday.

08:47.750 --> 08:51.130
-Oh, I can't. I have plans.
-What plans?

08:51.170 --> 08:53.970
Uh, to not be bored or miserable
at some old fuck's party.

08:54.010 --> 08:56.550
Come. You'll-you'll watch,
you'll see, you'll understand.

08:56.590 --> 08:57.800
I'll-I'll call you
with the address.

08:57.850 --> 08:59.100
Wear something... clean.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.650
ABE:
All right, everybody.

09:07.690 --> 09:09.110
Time's up.

09:09.150 --> 09:10.940
Put your papers on my desk

09:10.980 --> 09:13.320
if they contain
the correct answers,

09:13.360 --> 09:16.070
otherwise, just don't.

09:16.110 --> 09:18.570
-Abe.
-Oh, hello, Irving.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.910
What's up?

09:19.950 --> 09:21.410
I want you to meet
Charles Connelly,

09:21.450 --> 09:24.040
Executive Recruiter
from Bell Labs.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.460
Bell Labs.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.830
You got time to talk?

09:26.870 --> 09:28.710
Uh, sure.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.550
We're calling it
Project Echo, Abe.

09:30.590 --> 09:33.340
A quantum leap
in satellite technology.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.010
The commercial ramifications
of this could be huge.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.840
Not to mention
its defense capabilities.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.300
IRVING: It would revolutionize
the communications industry.

09:39.350 --> 09:40.970
CHARLES: And Bell Labs
is leading the pack.

09:41.010 --> 09:42.310
Abe, we're gathering
the best and the brightest

09:42.350 --> 09:43.770
to help us get there first.

09:43.810 --> 09:46.140
-May I stop you there?
-CHARLES: Of course.

09:46.190 --> 09:49.230
I want no part of Sputnik panic.

09:49.270 --> 09:50.440
This smacks of that.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.030
There's no panic, Abe.

09:52.070 --> 09:53.110
We're doing this right.

09:53.150 --> 09:54.320
We never rush R&D.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.400
Your colleague, Bill Chernik...

09:55.450 --> 09:56.780
Bill and Abe have known
each other a long time.

09:56.820 --> 09:58.870
Bill Chernik's a good man.

09:58.910 --> 10:00.450
CHARLES: He's been consulting
with us for a while.

10:00.490 --> 10:02.240
Ask him about us.
You'll like what you hear.

10:02.290 --> 10:03.950
There's no way this could work.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.870
My class load is so full.

10:05.910 --> 10:07.920
We can help with that.
Take things off your plate.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.340
No, I'm loath to do that.

10:10.380 --> 10:11.920
CHARLES:
We'll work around your schedule.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.710
An applied mathematician
of your skills

10:13.760 --> 10:15.340
is in high demand these days.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.220
-We need you.
-(chuckles)

10:17.260 --> 10:19.010
I told you he'd be a tough sell.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.600
Which makes us want you more.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.890
Pending a security clearance,

10:21.930 --> 10:23.310
Bell Labs is
at your beck and call.

10:23.350 --> 10:24.350
I need to get home.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.980
Let me walk with you.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.600
-(bell tolls)
-Please think it over.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.650
Take some time.
And call with any questions.

10:29.690 --> 10:31.440
-I doubt I'll have any.
-Call anyhow.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.110
I'll give you the pitch
all over again.

10:33.150 --> 10:35.190
And thanks for your time.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.900
See you Monday, Abe.

10:39.910 --> 10:42.240
We're going out to dinner!

10:42.280 --> 10:43.410
ROSE:
Abe?

10:43.450 --> 10:45.910
Rose, Rose, get in here.

10:45.950 --> 10:47.910
We are going out to dinner.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.000
Ruby Foo's, Le Pavillon,
name it.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.040
Abe, slow down.
Why are we going out to dinner?

10:53.090 --> 10:54.710
Bell Labs, Rose.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.840
I got an offer to work
at Bell Labs.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.930
-What?
-Bell Labs down in the village!

10:58.970 --> 11:00.390
Oh, my God, Abe!

11:00.430 --> 11:03.510
-(laughing)
-Oh, oh.

11:03.550 --> 11:06.680
You should have seen me
with that recruiter.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.770
I played it so cool.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.810
I kind of nodded like this,

11:10.850 --> 11:12.270
was shaking my head
a little bit.

11:12.310 --> 11:13.900
Very serious, very dubious.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.570
-Oh, you can look
extremely dubious. -(laughs)

11:16.610 --> 11:18.900
And he was eating
out of the palm of my hand.

11:18.950 --> 11:21.110
This is the big leagues, Rose.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.660
This... this is
the hotbed of invention.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.580
That TV that you all
like so much,

11:27.620 --> 11:31.250
-courtesy of Bell Labs
transistor work. -No.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.460
-ETHAN: Grandpa,
I was watching that. -Oh.

11:33.500 --> 11:37.960
Bardeen and Brattain and
Shockley won a Nobel for that.

11:38.010 --> 11:40.050
And now I am in their ranks.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.760
Where are we going for dinner?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.180
What about a dinner?

11:43.220 --> 11:44.600
We're going out.
The whole family.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.890
Call Noah and Astrid.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.720
He's got an offer
from Bell Labs.

11:48.770 --> 11:51.100
-Wow, Papa, congratulations.
-(laughs)

11:51.140 --> 11:52.690
Thank you very much.

11:52.730 --> 11:54.190
You've been obsessing
on Bell Labs

11:54.230 --> 11:55.820
-for, like, 20 years now.
-Mm-hmm.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.230
I haven't been obsessing
on them.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.110
My whole childhood, it was Bell
Labs this and Bell Labs that,

11:59.150 --> 12:00.780
and, "My God,
I'd give up pastrami

12:00.820 --> 12:02.030
for a job at Bell Labs."

12:02.070 --> 12:03.360
(laughs)
I may have mentioned them.

12:03.410 --> 12:04.910
A-And once a year, we'd tour
the building? The outside,

12:04.950 --> 12:06.280
-because we weren't allowed in.
-You kids would play

12:06.330 --> 12:07.950
on the sidewalk while your
father would jump up and down,

12:07.990 --> 12:09.290
-and try and peek
in the windows. -Yes.

12:09.330 --> 12:11.330
That may have happened
once or twice.

12:11.370 --> 12:13.000
-(chuckles)
-Is that my blouse?

12:13.040 --> 12:15.130
-Uh, yes, but it's not
quite right. -For what?

12:15.170 --> 12:18.250
Okay, I-I'm talking about
very important things here,

12:18.300 --> 12:20.170
and you're talking
about clothes.

12:20.210 --> 12:23.590
I have to get dressed.
Congratulations, Papa.

12:23.630 --> 12:25.890
How often do I get
a job at Bell Labs

12:25.930 --> 12:28.720
and no one wants
to celebrate with me?

12:28.760 --> 12:31.600
Oh, Abe, my love, we will find
the perfect night to celebrate.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.140
With Noah and Astrid?

12:33.190 --> 12:34.350
Uh, they will be there.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.770
I mean, it's Bell Labs.

12:35.810 --> 12:38.480
And we, we are all
so very proud of you.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.030
Mama, where's your green dress?

12:40.070 --> 12:41.030
At the cleaners.

12:41.070 --> 12:42.530
(whispers):
Oh, shoot.

12:45.660 --> 12:47.780
I'm never sure
about me and peach.

12:47.830 --> 12:50.450
Hmm. I am.

12:52.540 --> 12:53.710
Here.

12:53.750 --> 12:54.830
The Dior?

12:54.870 --> 12:56.460
Oh, that's perfect.

12:56.500 --> 13:00.250
-So, you're going
to another party. -Hmm?

13:00.300 --> 13:02.380
That's the fourth one
this week, isn't it?

13:02.420 --> 13:04.510
Four this week, three last week.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.970
Which, of course,
means they've already seen

13:06.010 --> 13:07.180
everything in my closet.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.720
Enter yours.

13:08.760 --> 13:12.560
So, are these friends
of yours and Joel's?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.560
No. New friends.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.940
-Girls from work.
-Hmm.

13:15.980 --> 13:17.400
What do you think?

13:17.440 --> 13:19.570
Lovely, understated.

13:19.610 --> 13:21.070
-Understated?
-Mm-hmm.

13:21.110 --> 13:23.570
-Next. -You don't want
to be understated?

13:23.610 --> 13:24.860
MIDGE:
I need to stand out.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.280
ROSE:
Well, you always stand out.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.160
I need to stand out
in a very specific way.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.530
Well, you could wear nothing.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.160
That would get
some sort of attention.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.500
Don't I know it.

13:32.540 --> 13:33.540
Now, tell me about--

13:33.580 --> 13:35.120
not until my funeral.

13:35.160 --> 13:39.500
So tell me, are there men
at these, uh, parties?

13:39.540 --> 13:41.550
They aren't nun parties, Mama.

13:41.590 --> 13:43.840
Well, you know, a girl
standing alone at a party

13:43.880 --> 13:45.590
-says just one thing.
-What's that?

13:45.630 --> 13:47.010
-I'm prey. Hunt me.
-Perfect.

13:47.050 --> 13:48.590
-Miriam.
-No, seriously,

13:48.640 --> 13:50.350
I was looking
for a catchphrase. That's it.

13:50.390 --> 13:51.760
You should wait
to go to these parties.

13:51.810 --> 13:52.970
It's too soon.

13:53.020 --> 13:54.350
I'll add some gloves to this.

13:54.390 --> 13:55.770
That should give it some zazz.

13:55.810 --> 13:57.400
-Miriam...
-Thanks for the dress, Mama.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.400
ROSE:
Oh...

14:07.860 --> 14:09.030
What are you doing here?

14:09.070 --> 14:10.320
What am I...?

14:10.370 --> 14:11.910
Y-You invited me
to this stupid party.

14:11.950 --> 14:12.990
No, I mean on the elevator.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.660
You're not leaving, are you?

14:14.700 --> 14:16.500
No, I've been riding this thing
up and down for an hour

14:16.540 --> 14:17.960
waiting for you to float in here

14:18.000 --> 14:19.630
on your golden fucking
Icarus horse.

14:19.670 --> 14:21.170
You got a pretty loose concept
of time, lady.

14:21.210 --> 14:22.800
Cabs were scarce.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.260
Well, are you waiting
for an engraved invitation?

14:24.300 --> 14:25.510
Get in here.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.930
Got to know
the building pretty well.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.550
Old guy on six has cancer.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.970
Oh, that's terrible.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.850
I inspired him to reach out
to his daughter.

14:34.890 --> 14:36.430
They've been on the outs
since she divorced.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.690
She's here now, cooking for him.

14:37.730 --> 14:38.810
That's nice.

14:38.850 --> 14:40.520
Oh, you hear that?

14:40.560 --> 14:42.320
Couple on the fourth floor,
they've been fighting

14:42.360 --> 14:43.820
for a full half hour.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.860
He pinched some girl's ass,
she saw.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.950
May have been
the cancer guy's daughter.

14:47.990 --> 14:50.200
Oh, I hope she did nothing
to encourage that.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.280
(elevator bell dings)

14:51.320 --> 14:52.410
You look nice, by the way.

14:52.450 --> 14:53.530
Thanks.

14:53.580 --> 14:54.790
Clean shirt?

14:54.830 --> 14:56.370
Uh, define "clean."

14:56.410 --> 14:59.580
(indistinct chatter,
soft music playing)

14:59.620 --> 15:02.210
Okay, this is the worst party
I've ever been to.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.590
We just walked in the door.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.260
Let's go get a hot dog
or something.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.510
No, no, no, stay.

15:08.550 --> 15:10.180
-Midge, hi.
-Hi, Mary.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.010
This is my friend, Susie.
Susie, Mary.

15:12.050 --> 15:14.180
Hi, Susie, come on in.
Meet the others.

15:14.220 --> 15:15.810
Eh, I feel like I got it.

15:15.850 --> 15:16.930
I'll see you inside, Mary.

15:16.970 --> 15:19.560
Nice meeting you.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.730
-What a drip.
-You're the drip.

15:21.770 --> 15:23.520
Come on, get with
the program here.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.940
Why would anyone in their
right mind go to parties?

15:25.980 --> 15:27.740
I mean, just buy
some Sno Balls and a beer,

15:27.780 --> 15:30.450
and take the subway at
rush hour, same fucking thing.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.280
I-I'm sorry,
I just don't get it.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.330
Midge, I think I'm in love.

15:34.370 --> 15:36.990
-Not again. -Come see him,
tell me if I'm crazy.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.120
He's my dad's boss.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.620
He's 70.

15:39.660 --> 15:41.870
And deaf and married,
but keep an open mind.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.290
That's my cue.

15:43.330 --> 15:44.500
Huh?

15:44.540 --> 15:46.710
(applause)

15:48.420 --> 15:50.420
Wait a minute.

15:51.470 --> 15:54.930
Wait a minute.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.060
I get it. I get it.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.180
Mary? I get it.

15:59.230 --> 16:00.850
MIDGE:
Wow, your silver anniversary.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.560
Your husband looks thrilled.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.940
Maybe we do need a better
motivator for men

16:05.980 --> 16:08.400
to get them to care
about the silver anniversary.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.320
Because what man really cares
about silver?

16:10.360 --> 16:13.910
Maybe 25 years is the Yankees
season tickets anniversary.

16:13.950 --> 16:15.870
-(laughter)
-Yeah!

16:15.910 --> 16:17.540
Yeah, and then
to get them to 50,

16:17.580 --> 16:19.290
we need something really good.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.660
Maybe it's the "another
woman's boobs" anniversary.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.790
-(laughter)
-Mm-hmm.

16:23.830 --> 16:27.630
Me, personally, I-I was never
great at gift-giving.

16:27.670 --> 16:30.460
Maybe it's because I never
got to celebrate Christmas.

16:30.510 --> 16:32.470
-I got Hanukkah.
-(soft laughter)

16:32.510 --> 16:34.180
Doesn't exactly prepare you
the same way.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.300
For Christmas,
a gentile would get a bike

16:36.350 --> 16:38.430
as a reminder
that their parents love them.

16:38.470 --> 16:40.890
For Hanukkah, we would get socks

16:40.930 --> 16:43.100
as a reminder
that we were persecuted.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.060
(laughter)

16:46.610 --> 16:48.520
Hey. You look happy.

16:48.570 --> 16:49.650
As a clam.

16:49.690 --> 16:50.940
I ate all the clams, by the way.

16:50.990 --> 16:52.490
See? Parties aren't so bad.

16:52.530 --> 16:54.200
Hmm. I'm just trying to
figure out the best way

16:54.240 --> 16:55.780
to hide a lobster under my hat.

16:55.820 --> 16:57.740
-So, did you catch my set?
-Your what?

16:57.780 --> 16:59.620
Just now. You hear all
the laughs I got?

16:59.660 --> 17:01.000
Yeah, I heard the laughs.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.160
Pretty funny, right?

17:02.200 --> 17:03.330
You're a funny woman.

17:03.370 --> 17:04.920
Could you pass the asparagus?

17:04.960 --> 17:07.380
I did a version of the Hanukkah
run a couple weeks ago,

17:07.420 --> 17:09.040
but I've honed it
a lot since then.

17:09.089 --> 17:11.010
Yeah, that was some
top-notch honing, there.

17:11.050 --> 17:13.300
RANDALL:
Darling? Darling, over here!

17:13.339 --> 17:14.970
Uh, yes, dear?

17:15.010 --> 17:16.390
RANDALL:
Come over here by the window.

17:16.430 --> 17:19.050
You're gonna want to see this.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.930
-MAN: Shh.
-What am I looking at?

17:20.970 --> 17:22.849
Well, nothing, silly,
the curtains are closed.

17:22.890 --> 17:24.640
I'm incorrigible.

17:24.690 --> 17:26.480
Let's open the curtains here.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.020
There, see?

17:28.060 --> 17:29.520
It's the neighbors
across the way again.

17:29.570 --> 17:30.980
The wife just got home.

17:31.030 --> 17:32.740
She's taking off her coat,

17:32.780 --> 17:34.530
and here comes her husband
to say hello,

17:34.570 --> 17:35.700
-and-- oh!
-(gasps)

17:35.740 --> 17:36.860
Did you see that?

17:36.910 --> 17:38.200
-He fell hard.
-(laughter)

17:38.240 --> 17:40.030
What the heck did he slip on?

17:40.080 --> 17:41.620
Whatever it is,
he's picking it up.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.290
It looks like a towel-- nope,
it's the cat.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.250
-He slipped on the cat?
-MIDGE: And he is angry.

17:46.290 --> 17:47.460
RANDALL:
The cat or the man?

17:47.500 --> 17:48.670
MIDGE: Well, they're both
pretty verklempt.

17:48.710 --> 17:50.340
Oh, you're Jewish.
I never knew that.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.130
20 years of marriage
and we're still learning things

17:52.170 --> 17:54.170
-about each other.
-I like that about us.

17:54.220 --> 17:55.930
RANDALL:
He's struggling with the cat...

17:55.970 --> 17:58.510
-The cat knocked his toupee off!
-MIDGE: The cat did him a favor.

17:58.550 --> 17:59.970
RANDALL: And he's thrown
the cat out the window.

18:00.010 --> 18:01.510
-MIDGE: Oh, my God!
-(laughter)

18:01.560 --> 18:02.720
MAN (on TV):
And the car had to have

18:02.770 --> 18:04.100
a fancy garage and a fancy
mansion to go with it.

18:04.140 --> 18:06.140
WOMAN (on TV): But I didn't
expect you to get the money

18:06.190 --> 18:07.900
-this month. -MAN: He wouldn't
care where I get it from!

18:07.940 --> 18:10.560
(woman continues speaking
indistinctly on TV)

18:10.610 --> 18:12.820
I told you to get it
and get out of that.

18:12.860 --> 18:15.070
ROSE:
Poor Virginia.

18:15.110 --> 18:17.700
Peter never listens to her,
now look at the mess he's in.

18:17.740 --> 18:20.120
Men only hear men...
and bartenders.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.660
She really thinks getting angry
will work?

18:22.700 --> 18:25.370
Why don't these writers just
give her a boyfriend, or a gun?

18:25.410 --> 18:27.210
-My God. So hostile today.
-I'm sorry.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.670
I'm just a wreck right now.

18:28.710 --> 18:30.290
-Everything's falling apart.
-Hold it.

18:30.330 --> 18:32.290
MAN (on TV): What's the
best way to reduce?

18:32.340 --> 18:34.300
-Commercial. -Eat plenty?
Or starve yourself?

18:34.340 --> 18:35.510
A half-empty...

18:35.550 --> 18:37.630
Okay.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.890
Miriam stopped wearing
her wedding ring.

18:39.930 --> 18:41.550
Oh, we're gonna need the ball.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.350
And Joel moved in
with that girlfriend.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.100
-DRINA: The secretary.
-ROSE: The home-wrecker.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.600
Like Sasha from
Edge of Night,

18:46.640 --> 18:48.140
always spreading it around.

18:48.190 --> 18:49.810
She's a nothing.
I know it won't last.

18:49.850 --> 18:51.310
If the secretary were just
out of the picture,

18:51.360 --> 18:52.690
Joel would come back.

18:52.730 --> 18:54.230
You want her out of the picture?

18:54.280 --> 18:56.070
I have cousins.
They have skills.

18:56.110 --> 18:58.030
-I'm sorry?
-Nothing.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.110
I'm looking at the ball.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.030
I see a new man
walking toward Miriam.

19:02.070 --> 19:03.490
Oh, my God, no.

19:03.530 --> 19:05.410
But he walked right past.
Yes, he's gone.

19:05.450 --> 19:06.870
-Feel better?
-It doesn't matter.

19:06.910 --> 19:08.250
There'll be another man
and another

19:08.290 --> 19:10.040
and another;
she's on the prowl.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.710
Every night she gets all dolled
up and goes to these parties.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.800
Like she's given up on Joel
and is trolling for husbands.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.300
She doesn't understand.

19:17.340 --> 19:18.880
Being a divorcée
is terrible, yes,

19:18.920 --> 19:20.380
but being on your
second marriage is...

19:20.430 --> 19:21.970
-Worse.
-So much worse.

19:22.010 --> 19:23.640
Second marriage says failure.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.970
At least divorcée
sounds continental.

19:26.020 --> 19:28.100
It'd be better if Joel had died,
then she'd be a widow.

19:28.140 --> 19:29.640
At least there's dignity
in that.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.020
You want Joel to die?

19:31.060 --> 19:32.810
Again, with the cousins.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.360
-I don't understand.
-Okay, I give up.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.780
I see an open path for Miriam.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.990
She will find her way.
I promise.

19:40.030 --> 19:42.410
Tell you what,
I'll make a tonic.

19:42.450 --> 19:45.530
Pour it in her soup,
it will help the luck stick.

19:45.580 --> 19:48.080
-Thank you, DRINA.
-You still look worried.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.000
-(sighs)
-I have the perfect thing.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.370
A distraction.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.210
♪ ♪

19:57.250 --> 19:59.260
Shh, shh.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.840
I think you'll love the color,
Mrs. Maracek. See you again.

20:06.260 --> 20:07.810
And what color
would you recommend

20:07.850 --> 20:09.850
for my unique complexion, Miss?

20:09.890 --> 20:11.480
Pasty?
I'd recommend Spackle.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.100
-And a putty knife.
-I'll pass.

20:13.150 --> 20:15.060
-So what are you doing here?
-I have a proposition.

20:15.110 --> 20:16.610
Oh, blessed day.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.820
The ring department's
on the third floor.

20:17.860 --> 20:18.940
Remember the four "C"s.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.240
A business proposition.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.400
But not here.

20:21.450 --> 20:22.570
You have time later today?

20:22.610 --> 20:24.370
I'm off in an hour.

20:24.410 --> 20:26.160
-Can you meet me at
the Stage Deli? -Sure.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.620
Great.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.790
Point me to the
shoplifting department?

20:29.830 --> 20:31.830
-Second floor, south side.
-Oh.

20:31.870 --> 20:33.960
-Excellent service.
-Oh.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
(indistinct chatter)

20:38.000 --> 20:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:45.010 --> 20:46.510
Oh. Hello there.

20:46.550 --> 20:48.510
Midge, this is my karate
instructor, Lew Fogelman.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.100
I'm Randall's agent.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.270
He's with William Morris,
so look impressed.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.890
I am impressed.

20:53.940 --> 20:55.310
Midge Maisel.

20:55.350 --> 20:56.730
I've heard good things.

20:56.770 --> 20:58.110
-I like you already.
-(chuckles)

20:58.150 --> 21:00.360
We're sitting now.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.070
So... my boy told me he was
having a bite with you,

21:03.110 --> 21:04.490
and I was in the neighborhood.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.200
Hope you don't mind
my stopping by.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.200
The Stage Deli is open to all.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.700
He's headed toward great things,
this one.

21:09.740 --> 21:11.200
-Just not in entertainment.
-Oh, will you shut up?

21:11.250 --> 21:12.580
You're annoying us both.

21:12.620 --> 21:13.830
I'm winningly self-deprecating.

21:13.870 --> 21:15.420
It says so right there
on the new resumes

21:15.460 --> 21:17.630
-you made me pony up for.
-Anyhow, he mentioned

21:17.670 --> 21:19.380
that the two of you have been
teaming up lately,

21:19.420 --> 21:20.670
which I find very interesting.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.970
-Teaming up?
-Just at parties.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.550
Just for fun. However,

21:24.590 --> 21:27.050
have you ever thought about
doing it professionally?

21:27.090 --> 21:29.720
-I-I don't understand.
-Sometimes a charming, funny guy

21:29.760 --> 21:32.980
with a cute, dizzy broad
on his arm is a good sell.

21:33.020 --> 21:35.020
-And I'm the dizzy broad?
-Fine.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.270
I'll be the dizzy broad and
you be the charming, funny guy.

21:37.310 --> 21:38.860
MIDGE:
Perfect.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.440
So you want to do an act...
with me?

21:40.480 --> 21:42.570
They're always looking
for duos like us

21:42.610 --> 21:44.740
for commercials,
radio, industrials.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.410
Company events--
you tell a few jokes,

21:46.450 --> 21:47.870
you mention the product
a bunch of times,

21:47.910 --> 21:49.200
you look pretty.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.950
You can make decent money
at this.

21:50.990 --> 21:53.540
-Seriously? -RANDALL: We'd be
a booker's dream.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.910
Who knows, we may be the next
Nichols and May.

21:57.420 --> 21:59.380
-You don't know Nichols and May?
-Should I?

21:59.420 --> 22:01.710
The next time they're in town,
you're going.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.130
-We're going.
-LEW: Speaking of going,

22:03.170 --> 22:04.800
I'll leave the two of you
to talk more.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.840
Food's on me; keep it under
a thousand bucks.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.430
It's been a pleasure.

22:08.470 --> 22:10.720
I'll send ten percent of
my matzo balls to you, Lew.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.930
And I'll take it.

22:12.970 --> 22:14.770
He's picking up our tab.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.520
Excellent.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.020
Next time, let's meet in
the shoe department at Saks.

22:19.060 --> 22:20.860
VONNIE: I don't care what
your fucking title is.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.690
-It's house manager.
-Your dirtbag friends come in

22:22.730 --> 22:24.570
and sit in my section,
they got to order.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.860
They don't got to order, they're
guests of the house manager.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.910
Then sit them
in another section.

22:28.950 --> 22:30.990
There's only one section,
your section.

22:31.030 --> 22:32.410
I fucking quit, Susie.

22:32.450 --> 22:33.700
I'm heartbroken.

22:33.740 --> 22:35.700
(phone ringing)

22:35.750 --> 22:37.830
-Gaslight.
-MIDGE: Hey, it's Midge.

22:37.870 --> 22:39.960
I left a bunch of messages
for you with Jackie.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.880
-Did he give them to you?
-Hang on.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.710
Jackie, did you have messages
from Midge for me?

22:44.760 --> 22:46.970
-Possibly. -Asshole.
-Asshole.

22:47.010 --> 22:50.090
You can't just throw in a random
off-topic "asshole."

22:50.140 --> 22:51.390
An asshole has to be motivated.

22:51.430 --> 22:52.810
You breathe. It's motivated.

22:52.850 --> 22:54.680
Hey, you guys have got to get
a divorce.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.100
I mean it.

22:56.140 --> 22:57.560
What was your message?

22:57.600 --> 22:59.600
I was just calling
to touch base.

22:59.650 --> 23:01.310
You left early the other night.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.650
-Well, they ran out of butter.
-MIDGE: Butter. Okay.

23:03.690 --> 23:06.690
Uh, well, we should
get together again.

23:06.740 --> 23:08.780
-Soon, okay?
-SUSIE: Yeah, sure.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.240
Hey, what was the deal
with you and that guy?

23:11.280 --> 23:14.080
-What guy? You mean Randall?
-I guess.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.370
We've been doing these bits
together at parties for a while.

23:16.410 --> 23:18.120
-They're a big hit.
-What, does he think

23:18.160 --> 23:20.000
-he's funny or something?
-He is funny.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.710
-You're kidding. -No.
He's a professional comedian.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.170
He was even thinking we could
get some work doing industrials.

23:25.210 --> 23:27.090
-Industrials?
-Yeah.

23:27.130 --> 23:29.590
What, you're gonna spin around
on a platform hawking Buicks?

23:29.630 --> 23:32.010
What's wrong with that? Buicks
are very fine automobiles.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.720
Miriam,
he just sold you some line

23:33.760 --> 23:35.680
'cause he wants
to get in your pants.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.470
He does not want
to get in my pants.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.850
-He wants to fuck you.
-He wants me to work with him..

23:39.890 --> 23:42.020
He says we'll be like
Nichols and May.

23:42.060 --> 23:43.440
Nichols and May don't fuck.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.110
Nichols and May totally fuck.

23:45.150 --> 23:47.320
-That's not what he says.
-I walked in on them once

23:47.360 --> 23:49.530
in the bathroom here-- even
their fucking was hilarious.

23:49.570 --> 23:51.530
Now you're just being
coarse and crude.

23:51.570 --> 23:52.700
Randall is totally legit.

23:52.740 --> 23:54.320
I met his agent and everything.

23:54.370 --> 23:56.330
You-you met his agent?

23:56.370 --> 23:57.950
At the Stage Deli.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.290
Uh, Lew something,
from William Morris.

24:00.330 --> 24:02.120
Nice guy. Bought us lunch.

24:02.170 --> 24:03.750
Susie, toilet's broken again.

24:03.790 --> 24:06.800
You might want to send
the house manager to manage it.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.300
You did that on purpose.

24:08.340 --> 24:09.550
Look, I got to go.

24:09.590 --> 24:11.550
Good luck with the Buicks.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.310
I can't find my cuff links.

24:17.350 --> 24:19.100
Did you check your cuffs, Papa?

24:19.140 --> 24:21.850
These are my Gimbels' cuff
links, my everyday cuff links.

24:21.890 --> 24:24.400
-I need my Finchley cuff links.
-Abe, you look fabulous

24:24.440 --> 24:26.440
-without them. Oh...
-It's a Finchley night.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.030
I'm gonna check the kids' room.

24:28.070 --> 24:30.030
The kids do not have
your Finchley cuff links.

24:30.070 --> 24:31.900
I had cuff links,
your kids moved in,

24:31.950 --> 24:33.200
-I don't have cuff links.
-Mm.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.530
Draw a conclusion.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.410
Shalom! It's Astrid!

24:36.450 --> 24:39.540
-Come on in, Astrid.
-Oh, hi! (giggles)

24:39.580 --> 24:40.830
Hello, you.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.120
-Mwah!
-Where's Noah?

24:42.160 --> 24:43.920
Astrid, please
let me stop the car

24:43.960 --> 24:45.580
-before you get out.
-I'm sorry.

24:45.630 --> 24:47.500
-We discussed this.
-I couldn't help it.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.500
I-I got presents
from our trip to Israel.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.720
Where are Esther and Ethan?
Where are my little pishers?

24:51.760 --> 24:53.470
Oh, they're already
at the babysitter's.

24:53.510 --> 24:56.090
-Oh, no. -Don't worry,
she tends to bring them back.

24:56.140 --> 24:58.760
-No cuff links. -Oh, you're
looking very handsome, Abe.

24:58.810 --> 25:00.720
I might as well be naked.

25:00.770 --> 25:02.180
That's an image
we're all happy to have.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.230
Pop, I got my hands
on the Bell Labs schematics

25:04.270 --> 25:06.100
from a friend--
lots of info, tons of specs.

25:06.150 --> 25:07.270
Study. Now.

25:07.310 --> 25:08.820
He walks right past his mother?

25:08.860 --> 25:11.400
-Sorry, Ma. Good to see you.
Mwah. Mwah. -Mwah.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.900
Midget, good to see you, too.

25:12.950 --> 25:14.780
Eh. You I could take or leave.

25:14.820 --> 25:16.620
Really, Astrid,
my arms are getting tired.

25:16.660 --> 25:18.490
-Please put those down.
-It's just that your apartment's

25:18.530 --> 25:20.120
so beautiful,
and I know you like everything

25:20.160 --> 25:22.250
in a certain way,
so maybe Noah can just take them

25:22.290 --> 25:24.210
back to the car
until the kids get home, or...

25:24.250 --> 25:25.870
-Give this to me.
-Oh, thank you.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.380
What's in the bag?

25:27.420 --> 25:28.710
Gefilte fish.

25:28.750 --> 25:31.260
-My next guess.
-I tried a new recipe.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.130
You'll be very happy-- there are
no onions in this one, Rose.

25:34.170 --> 25:36.010
"Happy" doesn't
quite describe it.

25:36.050 --> 25:37.930
-I'll take it, ma'am.
-Thank you, Zelda.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.930
-You know where to...
-Yes, I do.

25:39.970 --> 25:41.600
(sighs):
Here. This is for you.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.680
Honestly, Astrid,
you don't have to bring us gifts

25:43.730 --> 25:45.350
every time you go to Israel.

25:45.390 --> 25:47.730
-I... -What was this,
your sixth, seventh trip?

25:47.770 --> 25:49.110
-11th. (giggles)
-MIDGE: Oh.

25:49.150 --> 25:52.150
Can't get enough
of the Holy Land.

25:52.190 --> 25:55.240
(Abe and Noah talking
in distance)

25:55.280 --> 25:58.950
-What a beautiful mezuzah.
-(Astrid laughs)

25:58.990 --> 26:01.620
I'd never seen one
that big before. (laughs)

26:01.660 --> 26:03.950
It looks like it ate
all the other mezuzahs.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.290
Is that bad?

26:05.330 --> 26:07.420
-Oh. No.
-I could return it.

26:07.460 --> 26:10.290
-To Israel? -Rose,
Bell Labs has two cafeterias.

26:10.340 --> 26:12.050
Different cuisines in each one.

26:12.090 --> 26:13.920
I can choose.
I get to choose.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.590
I better start easing them out,

26:15.630 --> 26:17.470
or they'll lose all interest
in dinner.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.510
I brought you a gift, too.

26:20.550 --> 26:22.560
Is it another giant mezuzah?

26:22.600 --> 26:24.560
Oh, it is such a stupid gift.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.560
-Astrid, no.
-No, Rose has a mezuzah.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.650
You have a mezuzah.
It's not shoes--

26:28.690 --> 26:30.770
you can't just change them out
every season.

26:30.810 --> 26:33.280
No, but if we ever move
to a very big house...

26:33.320 --> 26:35.280
Oh, I just wish Rose liked me.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.530
She likes you very much.
She loves you, Astrid.

26:37.570 --> 26:39.490
-I make her nervous.
-Breathing makes her nervous.

26:39.530 --> 26:41.240
I thought that converting
would help.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.540
I know that it's hard having
an outsider in your family.

26:43.580 --> 26:45.330
You are not an outsider.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.250
-Mm-mm. I heard comments at
our wedding. -No one commented.

26:47.290 --> 26:49.000
"What's up with the shiksa
Noah married?"

26:49.040 --> 26:52.210
-Aunt Gertie, once.
-I'm an outsider. I'm barren.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.340
Astrid, you're young.

26:53.380 --> 26:55.050
No, I'm not. I'm 30.

26:55.090 --> 26:56.670
We're seeing the fertility
doctor again tomorrow.

26:56.720 --> 26:59.840
He's one of the pioneers
in cervical cap inseminations.

26:59.890 --> 27:01.300
Well, everyone looks good
in a cap.

27:01.350 --> 27:02.760
I'm almost too afraid to go.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.810
I mean, what if it
doesn't work this time?

27:04.850 --> 27:07.100
What methods did you and Joel
use to get pregnant?

27:07.140 --> 27:09.690
Well... sex.

27:09.730 --> 27:13.020
Yeah, that seems to work
for most people.

27:13.070 --> 27:14.110
Oh, honey...

27:14.150 --> 27:15.400
Seven years of trying.
I mean,

27:15.440 --> 27:16.690
(whispers):
what if he leaves me?

27:16.740 --> 27:18.150
Noah is not going to leave you.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.860
You did everything perfectly,
and that yutz left you.

27:20.910 --> 27:22.570
Noah loves you.

27:22.620 --> 27:24.330
And I know you think
he's pretty dreamy,

27:24.370 --> 27:26.700
but I'm his sister,
so I can tell you the truth.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.830
-Oh. -He's a big nerd
who lucked out and married up.

27:29.870 --> 27:31.830
-(sighs): No.
-Seriously. You're saving him

27:31.880 --> 27:34.250
-from a sad, lonely life
in a lab. -(laughs)

27:34.290 --> 27:36.000
He's not going anywhere. Okay?

27:36.050 --> 27:38.800
-ROSE: Miriam! Astrid!
We're leaving! -Okay.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.260
Okay.

27:40.300 --> 27:42.680
(indistinct chatter continues
in distance)

27:48.140 --> 27:51.900
♪ ♪

27:51.940 --> 27:54.110
ABE:
This is the eighth grade,

27:54.150 --> 27:56.150
and Miss Bedetsky
is so overloaded

27:56.190 --> 27:57.940
with math homework to grade,

27:57.980 --> 27:58.990
I offered to help.

27:59.030 --> 28:00.530
I was new to her class,

28:00.570 --> 28:01.910
and she thought it was cute

28:01.950 --> 28:04.070
that a 13-year-old
would offer to help.

28:04.120 --> 28:06.030
The emphasis on education
in the Jewish faith

28:06.080 --> 28:08.950
may be the thing
that I admire the most.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.750
Anyway, she let me try.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.870
And I graded them perfectly--

28:12.920 --> 28:15.000
without even using the key.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.000
She looked at me, astonished,
and then said,

28:18.050 --> 28:20.920
"Abraham Weissman,
you are a natural born

28:20.970 --> 28:22.590
-mathematician."
-Mm.

28:22.630 --> 28:23.840
I was so proud.

28:23.890 --> 28:25.850
(laughs)
Did you stay in touch with her?

28:25.890 --> 28:27.430
-That moron? No.
-ROSE: Abe.

28:27.470 --> 28:29.640
What? There were mistakes
she didn't find

28:29.680 --> 28:31.560
in the papers
she graded that day.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.100
So I corrected them
and immediately transferred

28:33.150 --> 28:34.900
-out of her class.
-He couldn't just stop

28:34.940 --> 28:36.900
at the nice part--
he just, he had to keep going.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.360
She left the school after that,
on my recommendation.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.400
I would like to propose a toast.
(clears throat)

28:41.450 --> 28:43.490
-ASTRID: Mmm.
-I have never understood

28:43.530 --> 28:46.320
what Abe Weissman was
talking about ever in my life.

28:46.370 --> 28:48.620
One time I made the mistake
of asking about his day.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.080
45 minutes later,
he was still talking,

28:50.120 --> 28:51.620
but I had taken to my bed.

28:51.660 --> 28:53.790
-(laughing)
-So for both of our sakes,

28:53.830 --> 28:55.830
I'm very glad
that he's finally found

28:55.880 --> 28:58.340
some people
who truly speak his language.

28:58.380 --> 29:01.340
And apparently whatever he's
been saying is very impressive.

29:01.380 --> 29:04.340
So please join me
in toasting my father,

29:04.380 --> 29:07.180
-the great Abe Weissman.
-NOAH: Cheers.

29:07.220 --> 29:09.140
L'chaim!

29:09.180 --> 29:11.020
(Midge clears throat)

29:22.360 --> 29:24.950
-What do we do?
-We should leave.

29:24.990 --> 29:27.030
-We're not leaving.
-He's practically on top of us.

29:27.070 --> 29:28.030
Wait, is that the secretary?

29:28.070 --> 29:29.120
There are a thousand restaurants

29:29.160 --> 29:30.580
in the city--
what are the odds?

29:30.620 --> 29:31.750
One in sixteen thousand,
four hundred fifty...

29:31.790 --> 29:33.040
Twelve thousand,
three hundred...

29:33.080 --> 29:34.660
I'm taking into account
weather effects,

29:34.710 --> 29:36.330
that some restaurants
are closed on Mondays...

29:36.370 --> 29:37.920
Yeah, yeah, but I'm calculating
differentials in geography,

29:37.960 --> 29:40.090
-quality... -We get it, guys,
the odds are low.

29:40.130 --> 29:41.210
She doesn't even look Jewish.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.630
-Is she Jewish or...?
-We should leave.

29:42.670 --> 29:44.090
Papa, this is your celebration.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.590
Don't let him ruin it.

29:45.630 --> 29:46.890
I couldn't find
my Finchley cuff links.

29:46.930 --> 29:48.850
It was an omen.
I should have heeded it.

29:48.890 --> 29:50.140
Papa, your cuff links
were not an omen.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.680
Her ankles are the same size
as her calves.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.310
Okay, if we're gonna stay,
we should probably

29:53.350 --> 29:54.770
figure out something else
to be talking...

29:56.440 --> 29:58.020
We should go.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.520
Put the egg rolls in your purse.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.150
-My purse is silk.
-Fine.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.900
Anyone with pockets,
grab a roll.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.820
-I'll get us a cab.
-We should walk.

30:04.860 --> 30:06.910
-I'm in heels.
-Fine, we're getting a cab.

30:06.950 --> 30:08.620
-Noah, get us a cab.
-Okay.

30:12.580 --> 30:14.200
(car horn honks)

30:14.250 --> 30:16.080
ABE:
Taxi!

30:16.120 --> 30:18.880
-NOAH: Taxi?
-ABE: Hey. Taxi!

30:18.920 --> 30:20.290
-JOEL: Midge.
-Joel, please...

30:20.340 --> 30:21.920
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.840
-I didn't know you'd be here.
-How could you?

30:23.880 --> 30:25.970
-I didn't know you came here.
-We don't. We never have.

30:26.010 --> 30:27.720
I've been steering clear of
Barney Greengrass and Zabar's.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.640
I go all the way over
to the East Side

30:29.680 --> 30:31.260
just to buy
a pack of cigarettes.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.600
We're celebrating.
It's a special occasion.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.430
My father got a job
at Bell Labs.

30:34.470 --> 30:37.140
Bell Labs? Wow, that's terrific.
He finally got it.

30:37.190 --> 30:38.480
It's a special occasion.
That-That's all.

30:38.520 --> 30:39.650
I'll never come here again.

30:39.690 --> 30:40.860
We'll never come here again.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.610
I'm sorry. I just...

30:42.650 --> 30:45.070
I didn't mean
to spoil the night.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.860
You didn't. It's...

30:57.250 --> 30:59.620
You should go back inside.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.880
Tell your...

31:04.920 --> 31:06.880
That's great...

31:06.920 --> 31:09.130
about Bell Labs.

31:23.110 --> 31:25.190
ASTRID:
And this is Rabbi Schneerson.

31:25.230 --> 31:27.190
A very good man,
but that card's in every pack,

31:27.240 --> 31:29.030
-so no one will trade you
for him. -(laughs)

31:29.070 --> 31:30.570
ROSE:
Capers and mustard.

31:30.610 --> 31:32.410
That's it for things
I recognize in here.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.200
We should have taken
the champagne.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.490
-It was already poured. -That's
why God invented funnels.

31:36.540 --> 31:38.160
No, wait, I see cottage cheese.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.330
-I like cottage cheese.
-(gasps) You got a Hirchensohn!

31:40.370 --> 31:42.460
Chief rabbi of Hoboken!

31:42.500 --> 31:44.460
(laughs) Have you ever seen
a Hirchensohn?

31:44.500 --> 31:46.590
To be honest, I've never seen
rabbi trading cards.

31:46.630 --> 31:48.130
Oh, one of the wonders
of Israel.

31:48.170 --> 31:49.720
That and Shabbat on a kibbutz.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.550
Okay, this might be soup
or gravy. I don't know.

31:51.590 --> 31:52.970
It's a container of brown--
should we try it?

31:53.010 --> 31:55.140
This is no longer
cottage cheese.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.100
ASTRID: I can't believe
someone actually came in here

31:57.140 --> 31:59.350
to steal the gefilte fish--
we could be eating that.

31:59.390 --> 32:01.810
-ROSE: Astonishing.
-You sure it's not here?

32:01.850 --> 32:03.810
-I looked.
-MIDGE: We looked.

32:03.860 --> 32:05.230
Can I go to bed now?

32:05.270 --> 32:06.780
-Oh...
-Of course, sweetie.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.150
Here, I'll take you.
Oh, and I can sneak in

32:09.190 --> 32:10.950
and steal a little kiss
for my baby Esther.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.910
Oh, no, uh, the baby
just went to sleep, Astrid.

32:12.950 --> 32:14.700
I promise you can kiss her
in the morning.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.530
Good night, Ethan.
Sweet dreams.

32:16.580 --> 32:19.000
(gasps)
Cookies. I found cookies.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.540
Oh, ignore
what your brother says--

32:20.580 --> 32:23.380
-you are officially
my favorite. Mmm. -Mmm.

32:23.420 --> 32:24.880
It's not going to last.

32:24.920 --> 32:27.300
-What's not?
-Joel and that woman.

32:27.340 --> 32:30.010
I saw him check
his watch. Twice.

32:30.050 --> 32:32.050
-Mama, don't...
-Trust me.

32:32.090 --> 32:34.930
That girl is on her way out.

32:43.600 --> 32:47.230
♪ You with the stars
in your eyes... ♪

32:47.270 --> 32:50.490
Cookie for a smoke?

32:50.530 --> 32:53.610
If the parents catch us,
this was your idea.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.820

-Yeah, yeah.

32:55.870 --> 32:58.330

33:03.710 --> 33:05.960
What a dinner, huh?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
What? Did something
unusual happen?

33:08.040 --> 33:09.750
I wasn't paying attention.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.840
I still can't believe
you and Joel split.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.430
Wasn't my plan, believe me.

33:13.470 --> 33:15.430
It's so disappointing.
I really liked the guy.

33:15.470 --> 33:17.050
God, and that girl he was with.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.680
When I saw that, I thought,
"I should hit him."

33:19.720 --> 33:21.270
And I would've.

33:21.310 --> 33:23.690
But then I remembered once
we were joking around,

33:23.730 --> 33:25.690
and I sort of
fake-punched his arm...

33:25.730 --> 33:27.150
Broke my pinkie.

33:27.190 --> 33:29.190
-What?
-He didn't look that big,

33:29.230 --> 33:31.190
but his arm
was like a brick wall.

33:31.230 --> 33:33.530
-Yeah, he had strong arms.
-It was humiliating.

33:33.570 --> 33:35.610
The next day at work
I had to make up a story

33:35.660 --> 33:38.070
-about being mugged in the park.
-You never told me any of this.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.870
Well... it wasn't my most...

33:39.910 --> 33:42.040
manly anecdote.

33:45.250 --> 33:48.420
I sure hate
that he hurt you, boy.

33:49.670 --> 33:51.630
Thanks.

33:51.670 --> 33:53.720
Make sure the next guy
you get involved with

33:53.760 --> 33:55.220
has very weak
upper body strength.

33:55.260 --> 33:57.010
-Of course.
-I'd like to defend your honor.

33:57.050 --> 33:58.930
-I'd appreciate that.
-But I have to be able

33:58.970 --> 34:00.890
to hold a pen the next day.

34:00.930 --> 34:03.560
Noah, listen,
you got to do me a favor, okay?

34:03.600 --> 34:04.770
Anything.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.350
Don't leave Astrid.

34:06.390 --> 34:07.980
Oh, my God.
I'm not gonna leave Astrid.

34:08.020 --> 34:09.440
-She thinks you are.
-I'm not.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.230
I've told her
a million times I'm not.

34:11.270 --> 34:13.030
-She's worried about h... -Kids.
I know, she's obsessed with it.

34:13.070 --> 34:15.489
I don't care if we have kids.
I want a dog.

34:15.530 --> 34:16.909
She's driving herself crazy.

34:16.949 --> 34:18.239
She's driving me crazy.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.659
I don't know
what to do with her.

34:19.699 --> 34:20.909
When she gets something
in her head--

34:20.949 --> 34:22.330
like the whole converting thing.

34:22.370 --> 34:24.909
She had to sign up for the
accelerated conversion package.

34:24.949 --> 34:26.370
Goy to Jew
in three weeks or less.

34:26.409 --> 34:28.540
Classes, rituals,
and weird baths in basements,

34:28.580 --> 34:30.840
and, oh, my God,
so much challah.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.340
-I remember.
-All to impress Mama.

34:32.380 --> 34:33.550
Who doesn't eat bread.

34:33.590 --> 34:35.130
And if I have to go to Israel

34:35.170 --> 34:36.590
-one more time...
-Just, please,

34:36.630 --> 34:39.260
till death do you part.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.469
I promise.

34:42.510 --> 34:45.480
She's a lucky gal.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.480
I should get back in.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.520
I'm playing hooky.

34:53.780 --> 34:55.820
-Hey, your old turntable.
-(short chuckle)

34:55.860 --> 34:58.240
And some really dirty
comedy albums.

34:58.280 --> 34:59.740
Don't tell Mama.

34:59.780 --> 35:01.240
Vestiges of Joel?

35:01.280 --> 35:03.580
Nope, they're mine.

35:03.620 --> 35:05.370
You know...

35:05.410 --> 35:07.620
I never did get
his thing for comedy.

35:07.660 --> 35:10.290
One time we came to see him,
he didn't seem that funny.

35:10.330 --> 35:12.250
-Hmm.
-You're the funny one.

35:12.290 --> 35:14.300
You've always been
the funny one.

35:14.340 --> 35:16.630
-Thanks.
-(baby starts crying)

35:16.670 --> 35:18.090
Astrid kissed the baby.

35:18.130 --> 35:20.130
It was inevitable.

35:24.640 --> 35:28.180
The food was good.

35:28.230 --> 35:31.230
I wonder if there really was
a General Tso.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.990
You get out.

35:42.030 --> 35:45.160
I, uh, have to go back
to the office for a while.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.660
Oh.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.710
Okay.

35:53.170 --> 35:54.670
Don't wait up.

36:08.350 --> 36:09.980
Who the hell are you?

36:10.020 --> 36:11.940
Susie Myerson.
Nice to meet you.

36:11.980 --> 36:14.110
The, uh, African masks
seem out of place.

36:14.150 --> 36:16.070
-How did you get in here?
-Are you kidding me?

36:16.110 --> 36:18.650
The entire William Morris Agency
goes to lunch from 1:00 to 2:00.

36:18.690 --> 36:20.700
Agents, secretaries,
security, the janitor.

36:20.740 --> 36:22.360
I could've done naked cartwheels
down the corridor

36:22.410 --> 36:23.820
and no one
would have stopped me.

36:23.870 --> 36:25.740
What is it with you people
and lunch?

36:25.780 --> 36:28.490
-Don't any of you eat breakfast?
-Get out from behind my desk.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.210
I-I'm sorry, you don't like
people behind your desk?

36:31.250 --> 36:33.960
Tell you what.
I won't get behind your desk

36:34.000 --> 36:35.750
if you won't get behind mine.

36:35.790 --> 36:37.590
Okay, I'm calling security.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.710
Oh, forget it, Lew.
I cut the lines.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.510
You what?

36:41.550 --> 36:43.800
Ah, I didn't cut the lines.
Just wanted to sound like

36:43.840 --> 36:46.720
I was in a Bogart picture for
a second. It was kind of cool.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.720
Who the fuck are you?

36:48.770 --> 36:50.680
You handle a guy,
Randall something.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.350
I don't know the last name.
He's a client of yours, right?

36:53.390 --> 36:55.270
Introduced you to a woman
named Midge Maisel?

36:55.310 --> 36:56.770
Yeah, so?

36:56.810 --> 36:58.860
So? Midge Maisel's
a client of mine.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.860
-You're her rep?
-Yup.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.780
And she doesn't need
a William Morris agent

37:02.820 --> 37:05.280
in her life right now. She's got
everything she needs with me.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.780
And who are you,
to be telling me this?

37:07.830 --> 37:10.700
Lew, we both know what a place
like this does with someone

37:10.750 --> 37:13.290
like Midge--
a girl comic, good-looking,

37:13.330 --> 37:15.420
just starting out, can't sing.

37:15.460 --> 37:18.630
You meet 'em at the deli,
like you did, all casual-like.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.260
And then you schedule a fancy
lunch-- there's always lunch--

37:21.300 --> 37:23.300
talk to 'em about
their hopes and their dreams,

37:23.340 --> 37:25.130
you promise them everything,
you deliver nothing,

37:25.180 --> 37:27.010
and then you dump 'em
if lightning doesn't strike

37:27.050 --> 37:28.510
within the first five minutes.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.010
She does not need you.

37:30.060 --> 37:31.930
She does not need Randall.
She needs me.

37:31.980 --> 37:33.310
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

37:33.350 --> 37:34.770
What kind of contract
you got with her?

37:34.810 --> 37:36.650
Same kind of contract
you got with your nuts--

37:36.690 --> 37:38.560
there's two of us
and we're attached.

37:38.610 --> 37:40.400
And if you ever
go near Midge again,

37:40.440 --> 37:42.780
I will make it
my life's mission to take you

37:42.820 --> 37:44.820
and this entire building down.

37:46.530 --> 37:49.580
Oh, and... here's my card.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.620
In case you need it someday.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.040

38:18.650 --> 38:21.480
It's excellent toasted

-if you're so inclined.
-(sniffs) Mm.

38:23.530 --> 38:24.820
Sit down.

38:24.860 --> 38:26.820
I like what you've done
with the place.

38:26.860 --> 38:29.620
-Do you?
-Yes. It looks...

38:29.660 --> 38:31.780
What shall we toast to?

38:31.830 --> 38:33.620
Not yet.
I want to talk first.

38:33.660 --> 38:35.250
Oh. Okay. Sounds serious.

38:35.290 --> 38:37.000
-You got a phone.
-I did.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.960
You said you
didn't get the phone.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
-Yeah, well,
I'm a cockeyed optimist. -Hmm.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.800
So, how you doing?

38:42.840 --> 38:44.210
I'm fine.

38:44.260 --> 38:46.590
Good. Good.
So you're not insane?

38:46.630 --> 38:48.720
-I don't think so.
-'Cause you seem insane.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.260
What are you talking about?

38:50.300 --> 38:52.100
This party circuit thing
you've got going on,

38:52.140 --> 38:54.060
I don't know
what you really think it is,

38:54.100 --> 38:55.480
but it's not stand-up.

38:55.520 --> 38:57.390
It's not a gig, it's a party.

38:57.440 --> 39:00.400
Yeah? You are not getting paid,
you are not getting booked,

39:00.440 --> 39:02.230
and those people
are not a real audience--

39:02.270 --> 39:04.730
they are politely nodding at you
while they drink free booze,

39:04.780 --> 39:06.610
and then they talk
about the crazy lady

39:06.650 --> 39:08.490
who wouldn't shut up
the whole night.

39:08.530 --> 39:10.070
I know they're not real gigs.

39:10.110 --> 39:11.820
Do you? 'Cause it
doesn't seem like it.

39:11.870 --> 39:13.990
-And second of all...
-There was no first of all.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.750
...you do not need a goddamn man
at your side to do this.

39:16.790 --> 39:18.460
What the hell are you thinking?

39:18.500 --> 39:20.790
You really want to be some
second-rate Nichols and May?

39:20.830 --> 39:22.710
'Cause there's already
a first-rate Nichols and May.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.420
It's fuckin' Nichols and May.

39:24.460 --> 39:27.510
Now, you could be an original,
but you are fucking it all up

39:27.550 --> 39:30.550
with this cockamamie alternate
universe party bullshit.

39:30.590 --> 39:32.430
You want to do this?!

39:32.470 --> 39:33.850
-Yes.
-Do you?

39:33.890 --> 39:35.890
-Yes!
-Well, I can't tell anymore.

39:35.930 --> 39:37.810
You want me to get rid of
the phone, 'cause I can get rid

39:37.850 --> 39:39.310
-of the phone.
-Do not get rid of the phone.

39:39.350 --> 39:40.560
I don't need
to have a goddamn phone.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.940
I don't have anybody
I have to call.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.690
I got that phone for you,

39:43.730 --> 39:46.030
for this partnership
that I thought we were starting.

39:46.070 --> 39:48.240
-We are.
-Does your new agent know that?

39:48.280 --> 39:49.530
He's... not my...

39:49.570 --> 39:51.910
You do not meet
with any agents

39:51.950 --> 39:54.330
without me knowing
about it, ever.

39:54.370 --> 39:56.450
I did not know he was
gonna be there. I swear.

39:56.490 --> 39:58.870
Bullshit! You're not an idiot!

39:58.910 --> 40:01.420
Just drop this doe-eyed
Bambi thing right now.

40:01.460 --> 40:04.380
Okay, I'm so sick of you
acting all innocent: "Oh,

40:04.420 --> 40:06.920
"I don't know how the world
works 'cause I'm a housewife,

40:06.960 --> 40:08.710
and I wear four layers
of petticoats."

40:08.760 --> 40:10.420
It is tired and it is weak,

40:10.470 --> 40:12.970
and you are not tired
and you are not fucking weak.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.890
And if you want to be a comic,

40:14.930 --> 40:17.970
you are gonna have
to grow the fuck up right now!

40:18.020 --> 40:20.100
(whimpers)

40:20.140 --> 40:22.350
(sniffles)

40:22.400 --> 40:25.400
(sobbing)

40:25.440 --> 40:28.610
(sniffles)
I'm sorry. I...

40:28.650 --> 40:30.360
I don't know what to do lately.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.860
I'm... I'm trying to be strong
and independent,

40:32.910 --> 40:35.660
but I saw Joel the other night,
and he was with her,

40:35.700 --> 40:38.870
and every time I think
I can breathe again, I can't.

40:38.910 --> 40:40.540
And I'm-I'm trying
to get it right.

40:40.580 --> 40:42.080
I'm trying to figure it out.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.750
I know the parties aren't gigs.

40:43.790 --> 40:45.670
I know I'm not
really doing stand-up.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.750
I don't want to be
a second-rate Nichols and May.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.510
I'd never even heard
of Nichols and May.

40:49.550 --> 40:50.970
And I've got news for you.

40:51.010 --> 40:52.930
If you're gonna be
a personal manager,

40:52.970 --> 40:55.640
then sometimes you're gonna have
to deal with the personal.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.220
And this...

40:57.260 --> 40:58.810
is personal.

40:58.850 --> 41:00.350
All of this.

41:00.390 --> 41:03.100
And it's not
just deals and lectures.

41:03.140 --> 41:05.270
Sometimes you're gonna have
to buy some Kleenex

41:05.310 --> 41:07.480
and let me cry
and pat me on the back

41:07.520 --> 41:09.650
-and say, "There, there."
-Okay, that's not really my...

41:09.690 --> 41:10.940
You're gonna have
to listen to me talk

41:10.990 --> 41:12.570
about my husband,
and my kids.

41:12.610 --> 41:14.200
Both of 'em?

41:14.240 --> 41:15.910
Yes. Both of them.

41:15.950 --> 41:19.120
And you are gonna have
to stop backing away from me

41:19.160 --> 41:21.950
when I feel like my life
is falling apart.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.460
You are gonna have to tell me
I'm good when I'm not.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.040
-You want me to lie?
-Yes!

41:27.080 --> 41:29.050
That is what managers do!

41:29.090 --> 41:31.760
Do you understand?

41:31.800 --> 41:33.470
(Midge exhales)

41:34.470 --> 41:36.300
(Midge crying quietly)

41:38.260 --> 41:39.640
(sobs)

41:42.810 --> 41:44.770
There, there.

41:46.850 --> 41:48.560
Better?

41:50.940 --> 41:53.570
(sniffles)
Yes.

41:53.610 --> 41:55.700
Better.

41:55.740 --> 41:57.240
Good.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.990
Tomorrow...

41:59.030 --> 42:02.120
we're gonna sign
some fuckin' paperwork.

42:04.160 --> 42:06.710
The last few signatures.
I promise.

42:06.750 --> 42:08.500
Responsibility is often

42:08.540 --> 42:11.500
-accompanied by
excessive paperwork. -And how.

42:11.550 --> 42:13.210
Especially when
the government's involved.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.220
If you'd asked me a week ago,
I would not have put money

42:15.260 --> 42:16.470
on us sitting here today.

42:16.510 --> 42:18.390
Well, I had to shuffle
quite a few things around,

42:18.430 --> 42:22.390
make some tough compromises,
and you seemed so desperate.

42:22.430 --> 42:24.520
We are thrilled, believe me.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.770
All your background checks
are completed.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.020
You sailed through

42:27.060 --> 42:28.230
-faster than most.
-Very good.

42:28.270 --> 42:30.480
Now, there's just
the final government clearance.

42:30.520 --> 42:33.690
It's somewhat more intensive,
but it should go smoothly, too.

42:33.730 --> 42:35.400
The only possible bump I see

42:35.440 --> 42:36.860
would be
your daughter's arrests.

42:38.110 --> 42:40.990
Her arrests?

42:41.030 --> 42:42.580
We know, a couple of
misdemeanors, she pled guilty.

42:42.620 --> 42:44.290
It shouldn't be
too big a problem.

42:44.330 --> 42:46.750
Right. Yes.

42:46.790 --> 42:48.290
Young people go through
these phases, right?

42:48.330 --> 42:51.420
Yes, young people go
through phases.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.920
Things I did in college,
it's amazing my parents

42:52.960 --> 42:54.010
still talk to me.

42:54.050 --> 42:56.840
(chuckles)

42:56.880 --> 42:58.720
We'll ease you in
the first couple of days.

42:58.760 --> 43:01.220
One of us will take you
on a tour of the facility,

43:01.260 --> 43:02.260
get you oriented.

43:02.310 --> 43:03.890
Might be me,
might be my colleague, Sven.

43:03.930 --> 43:05.470
Sven is a great fellow.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.980
MIDGE: I was cornered by
Mrs. Klaviter today. -ROSE: Mm.

43:08.020 --> 43:09.730
Ever since she kicked Junie Paul
in the shins,

43:09.770 --> 43:11.690
-I run when I see her. -She
starts telling me this story

43:11.730 --> 43:13.270
-about her mother's health.
-Mm.

43:13.320 --> 43:15.650
And right as she says
she's only got a month to live,

43:15.690 --> 43:17.530
the baby starts laughing.

43:17.570 --> 43:20.820
I tell you, it was
the world's longest pause.

43:20.870 --> 43:23.740
But then,
Mrs. Klaviter laughed, too.

43:23.780 --> 43:26.160
Turns out, she hates her mother
and thinks Esther's a delight.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.410
(Rose laughs)

43:27.460 --> 43:28.870
(chuckles)

43:28.910 --> 43:30.170
What?

43:35.050 --> 43:36.260
ROSE: What ever happened
to Junie Paul?

43:36.300 --> 43:38.510
I wonder if she ever married.

43:38.550 --> 43:40.050
I would think.

43:40.090 --> 43:41.680
ROSE: She just needed to
keep her hair long enough

43:41.720 --> 43:44.010
-to cover those ears.
-They were enormous,

43:44.060 --> 43:45.560
but she could hear
someone whispering

43:45.600 --> 43:46.850
from across a football field.
I'm kidding.

43:46.890 --> 43:47.890
MIDGE (on tape):
I was fun.

43:47.930 --> 43:49.140
I planned theme nights,

43:49.190 --> 43:51.230
I dressed in costumes,

43:51.270 --> 43:54.440
I gave him kids,
a boy and a girl! And yes,

43:54.480 --> 43:56.190
our little girl is looking more
and more like Winston Churchill

43:56.230 --> 43:57.990
-every day, with the big...
-(men laughing)

43:58.030 --> 44:01.610
Yalta-head? But that's not
a reason to leave, right?

44:01.660 --> 44:03.530
Really? Really? After what
I just said about the bathroom?

44:03.570 --> 44:05.200
OZ: It's like she's having
a breakdown.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.080
-VIRGIL: But it's hysterical.
-OZ: It's amazing.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.210
MIDGE (on tape):
Walk of shame!

44:09.250 --> 44:10.790
VIRGIL:
It's total improv.

44:10.830 --> 44:12.420
OZ:
Nah, this had to be written.

44:12.460 --> 44:15.590
MIDGE (on tape):
And I showed him I loved him.

44:15.630 --> 44:17.760
All that shit they say
about Jewish girls...

44:17.800 --> 44:19.800
OZ: Well, whatever it is,
it's genius.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.220
-VIRGIL: Pure genius. -OZ: And
you don't know who she is?

44:22.260 --> 44:24.100
VIRGIL: All we know is she's
married to some guy named Joel,

44:24.140 --> 44:25.720
and she lives uptown.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.560
OZ: Let's dub a hundred
and see where it goes.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.640
(audience laughing on tape)

44:29.680 --> 44:31.350
MIDGE (on tape): I can't believe
this is happening.

44:31.390 --> 44:34.610
I can't believe I'm losing him
to Penny Pann.

44:34.650 --> 44:36.690
That's her name.
Terrible right?

44:36.730 --> 44:38.480
-(Oz and Virgil laughing)
-MIDGE: Penny Pann!

44:38.530 --> 44:40.240
Penny Pann.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.410
-Penny Pann!
-(audience laughs and cheers)
