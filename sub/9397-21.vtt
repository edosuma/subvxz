<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.719 --> 00:05.837
Haley, marry me again
in front of all our friends and our family.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.069
You know, it's actually hurt me

00:07.160 --> 00:09.310
to see what's happened
with your relationship with Dan.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.868
Uncle Cooper.
What are you doing here, man?

00:11.960 --> 00:13.518
I met this smoking-hot girl.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.079
- I'm 17.
- You gotta go.

00:15.160 --> 00:17.230
You know you still want me, Cooper.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.832
The guy shot up a school!

00:22.920 --> 00:24.797
Yo, Marcus. Would you shut up, man?

00:24.880 --> 00:26.552
I hope they fry his ass.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.633
Promise me that when you pick
the boy you're really gonna be with

00:31.720 --> 00:33.517
he's someone who you love.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.669

01:20.800 --> 01:22.916
<i>"Once upon a time</i>
<i>there was a beautiful Princess</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:25.309
<i>"who lived in a kingdom far, far away.</i>

01:25.400 --> 01:27.709
<i>"And in that kingdom</i>
<i>there also lived a Boy.</i>

01:27.800 --> 01:29.950
<i>"And the Princess loved that Boy."</i>

01:32.720 --> 01:33.948
Unbelievable.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.556
<i>"And so, the two decided to marry."</i>

01:51.120 --> 01:52.758
Did you just say
you wanted to get married?

01:52.840 --> 01:55.149
Yeah. Crazy, right?

01:56.240 --> 01:58.959
- It's a little nuts. Yeah.
- Okay, but maybe not.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.148
I mean, it worked for Nathan and Haley.
Look how happy they are.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.912
Brooke. Let me in!

02:04.400 --> 02:07.198
- No, it's not ready. Go away.
- It's my apartment.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.238
And it's my wedding dress,
for that matter.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.753
No, it will be.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.832
But for now, it is my wedding dress
and it is not ready.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.593
Does it look like my dream dress?
Like Vera Wang meets Snow White?

02:17.680 --> 02:19.750
- It's better.
- Yay!

02:19.840 --> 02:21.558
This is so exciting!

02:22.160 --> 02:25.994
So, how did Nathan
ask you to marry him the first time?

02:27.440 --> 02:31.149
Well, it was raining
and we just had that argument.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.231
The... That one that I told you about.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.072
The one about the Internet porn?

02:35.160 --> 02:37.151
Yes, thank you for reminding me.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.311
Anyway, we made up in the rain

02:42.400 --> 02:44.755
and we were laying in bed the next day

02:44.840 --> 02:48.037
and he just looked over at me and said,

02:48.480 --> 02:49.959
"You're my family now."

02:50.040 --> 02:52.679
And he said that he could love me forever,

02:53.680 --> 02:55.591
then he asked me to marry him.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.518
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.229
But the dress still isn't ready,

03:00.320 --> 03:02.709
so you need to find something else
to do with yourself, chop-chop.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.995
You're such a grouch
when Lucas isn't around.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.548
- How long until he gets back?
- A couple of hours.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.235
Just in time for your rehearsal party,
which like your dress is a total surprise.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.630
- I hate surprises.
- Not these you won't. I promise.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.073
Get out of here.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.396
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.357
- You're Deb, right?
- Yeah.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.999
I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get in touch with Cooper.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.116
- I'm...
- No, no. I'm sorry. He's out of town.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.156
Can I give him a message?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.389
Just tell him his girlfriend stopped by.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.629
Rachel?

03:43.520 --> 03:47.877
Look, I know you've called the house
and I'm sure you've tried his cell,

03:47.960 --> 03:51.589
but I think you know
this is not going to work out.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.554
Well, maybe I'll just wait
and hear that from him.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.995
You're not going to. Okay?

03:58.080 --> 04:00.071
And I know that must hurt,

04:00.160 --> 04:03.118
but you're in high school
and he's nearly 30.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.595
What's next? He takes you to the prom?

04:06.200 --> 04:10.671
If you thought this could work,
you wouldn't have lied in the first place.

04:12.280 --> 04:16.956
Did he tell you that he slept with me
after he knew how old I was?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.279
Yes, he did.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.672
He also told me
that it was a terrible mistake.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.079
One he regrets.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.637
Just tell him I stopped by.

04:38.000 --> 04:38.989
Okay, this is weird.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.069
I mean, normally it's the groom

04:40.160 --> 04:41.388
that can't see the dress
before the wedding,

04:41.480 --> 04:43.152
- not the bride.
- Okay, quit whining. Are you ready?

04:43.240 --> 04:44.355
Yes, please!

04:44.440 --> 04:49.070
All right, Haley James Scott,
I now pronounce you... fabulous!

04:50.720 --> 04:51.948
Do you love it?

04:52.720 --> 04:56.952
You're speechless. I knew you would be.
Hold on, there's one more thing.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.438
Do you get it? Halo.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.193
Wow, wow, Brooke, this is...

05:03.800 --> 05:05.074
You're welcome.

05:05.160 --> 05:09.676
Thank you so much for asking me
to be your maid of honor. I love weddings.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.474
<i>"Now, in this kingdom all was not well."</i>

05:14.520 --> 05:17.239
I love you, Jake. I do.

05:17.800 --> 05:21.713
And you know that I love Jenny.
So maybe that's enough.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.197
I think only in fairy tales
that's enough, Peyton.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.397
You know what? Someone told me once

05:29.480 --> 05:31.948
that there's nothing wrong
with fairy tales.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.508
Everybody lives happily ever after.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.553
Okay, listen to me.

05:37.640 --> 05:42.236
You can't just fly into Savannah,
and then get in my head all over again,

05:42.320 --> 05:45.437
tell me you want to stay,
and then ask me to marry you.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.636
- Well, why not?
- Because,

05:49.520 --> 05:51.033
I might just say yes.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.108
<i>"So the Princess and the Boy</i>
<i>were set to be wed,</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:11.239
<i>"and because she was a Princess,</i>
<i>the call went out for a beautiful gown. "</i>

06:17.680 --> 06:20.911
Whoa! Sorry. I'm not supposed
to see you in your wedding dress, right?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.470
- It's okay, this is not my wedding dress.
- It's not?

06:24.560 --> 06:25.675
No, it's supposed to be,

06:25.760 --> 06:28.433
but there is no way
that I'm getting married in this frock.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.476
I asked Brooke to make me
something simple and elegant.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.348
And instead, she makes me something
that's so... Brooke!

06:34.440 --> 06:36.749
Well, maybe you should wear it, anyway.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.955
I mean, Brooke's your maid of honor

06:38.040 --> 06:39.519
and you did ask her
to make the dress, right?

06:39.600 --> 06:40.635
So?

06:40.720 --> 06:43.917
Well, so, she'd be crushed
if you didn't wear it.

06:45.240 --> 06:49.233
Anyway, doesn't matter what you wear,
my girl's gonna look beautiful.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.229
Thank you.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.794
- Except maybe in this thing...
- Shut up!

06:59.640 --> 07:02.200
Hello? Oh, okay.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.955
Yeah, yeah, I know where it is.
All right, I'll be there.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.314
All right, bye.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.198
Peyton's car broke down.
You wanna come with me?

07:09.280 --> 07:11.555
Yeah, actually, let me just go change.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.675
You can drop me at the CafÃ©.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.718
I'm gonna need money
for a new wedding dress.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.112
What's on your mind, kiddo?

07:25.760 --> 07:27.079
Brooke.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.676
You know, it was nice to get away,
but I'm glad we're gonna be home soon.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.835
Did you like
any of the colleges we looked at?

07:34.920 --> 07:39.835
Yeah, but, you know, I figure
I'll just go to somewhere we can afford.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.273
I mean, thanks to my heart condition,

07:41.360 --> 07:44.238
I won't be getting
a basketball scholarship.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.838
You know this trip
wasn't just about finding you a school.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.480
- It was also about finding a way back.
- To what?

07:51.560 --> 07:54.028
To a place where it's okay to dream again.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.199
You know,
you walked away from basketball

07:58.280 --> 08:00.157
so that you could live a long life.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.674
But what are you gonna do with that life?

08:04.320 --> 08:06.595
What's your next dream, Lucas?

08:16.680 --> 08:19.069
Hey. Sorry about this.

08:19.160 --> 08:23.199
- No problem. What'd it do, overheat?
- Yeah. I'm not really sure why, though.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.758
So how's your leg doing?

08:29.720 --> 08:30.994
It's okay.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.356
It's just kind of weird
everybody knowing about it.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.510
I was in the Tutor Center that day.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.353
Well, I guess
you know my friend Haley then?

08:45.440 --> 08:46.873
Not really.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.269
But I think that was kind of the point.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.596
You got a hole in your radiator.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.669
I'm gonna have to tow you in.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.478
But I can drop you off somewhere,
if you want.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.915
No, it's okay. I called someone.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.798
Hey. You okay?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.916
- How's it going, Nate?
- Hey, Marcus.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.469
- So, I guess you guys have met.
- Yeah.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.074
How you been?

09:14.560 --> 09:15.879
Could be better.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.794
- You mind giving me a hand?
- Sure.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.394
- I'm gonna go clear my head.
- Okay.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.389
So, I haven't seen you around much.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.438
That's 'cause
you don't hang out with any cool people.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.115
It's good.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.789
That day in the Tutor Center
kind of screwed me up.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.238
Yeah, I think
it kind of screwed all of us up, man.

09:49.840 --> 09:55.039
Yeah, I guess, but I just made it worse.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.238
Sometimes I wish I could talk to the kid
in that room and try to help him.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.159
Edwards, you mean?

10:03.800 --> 10:04.949
And me, too.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.832
The me I was then.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.871
So you're working
a part-time job now, huh?

10:13.040 --> 10:14.837
No, full-time.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.235
- You dropped out of school?
- Yeah.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.549
It was hard walking past that room,
so I just quit going.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.796
I thought it might help, but

10:25.360 --> 10:28.352
I guess we're all
gonna have that day with us forever.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.355
You know I love you, Sawyer,

10:36.800 --> 10:40.110
but isn't this the kind of thing
you usually call Lucas for?

10:37.920 --> 10:40.275
- He's out of town.
- What about Brooke?

10:41.480 --> 10:42.993
Jake, you okay?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.870
You know you talk in your sleep?

10:52.880 --> 10:54.359
Yeah, I'm sorry.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.472
I've been sitting awake,
wrestling with the feeling that

10:59.880 --> 11:01.836
you need to go back to Tree Hill.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.798
You shouldn't stay here.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.158
- That you can't.
- Why? What happened?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.758
You talk in your sleep, Peyton.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.436
Okay, so what? I don't understand.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.634
So, I mumble a few words in my sleep.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.709
I mean, what did I say
that was really that bad?

11:23.920 --> 11:25.399
Did I say
I wanted to kill you or something?

11:26.400 --> 11:28.630
No. You said, "I love you."

11:27.960 --> 11:30.155
Okay, well, normally that's a good thing.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.637
You said "I love you, Lucas."

11:34.040 --> 11:38.033
<i>"Now, as the wedding day approached,</i>
<i>the Princess worried about the evil King.</i>

11:42.040 --> 11:44.429
<i>"Because, although</i>
<i>he had not always been this way,</i>

11:46.120 --> 11:47.269
<i>"his heart had turned dark</i>

11:48.600 --> 11:51.558
<i>"and his kingdom had grown</i>
<i>to fear and despise him. "</i>

11:49.840 --> 11:51.910
Okay, Mr. Scott, you gotta go home.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.714
'Cause you've been out here all morning

12:01.600 --> 12:03.272
and you're kind of creeping
some of the customers out.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.520
- Deb's not working today, okay?
- How's Nathan doing?

12:04.720 --> 12:07.188
- I mean, since he lost Keith.
- He's a mess.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.318
Especially since he lost his father
long before that.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.909
Haley.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.034
I hear the two of you
plan on renewing your vows.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.119
I'm happy for you.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.392
You're the best thing that's happened
in his life in a long time.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.277
Would you please just tell him
I send my best?

12:24.480 --> 12:25.799
I understand he wants to keep his distance

12:26.440 --> 12:27.998
with this restraining order. I respect that.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.875
Mr. Scott.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.710
I'm not buying it. This.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.469
You.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.871
I guess I can respect that, too.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.119
I'm glad
that you're protective over him, Haley.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.319
I suppose if he reaches his potential,

12:45.080 --> 12:47.753
it doesn't matter who got him there,
you or me.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.234
It's just that
he gets there that's important.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.598
Have a nice wedding day.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.755
<i>Hey, this is Cooper, you know the drill.</i>

12:59.920 --> 13:04.630
Hey, Cooper, guess I was just thinking
about you and thought I'd try you again.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.759
Give me a call, okay?

13:07.240 --> 13:10.357
It's kind of starting to feel
like you're trying to avoid me.

13:09.560 --> 13:10.959
Okay, bye.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.990
Hey, buddy. Okay,
I know I said I was done with the dress,

13:24.480 --> 13:26.311
but I came up with a fantastic idea.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.473
- I need to talk to you about the dress.
- Okay.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.955
I know that you've worked
really hard on this

13:32.880 --> 13:34.996
and I just love you for it.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.915
I just don't know if it's me.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.355
- You don't like it?
- No, it's not that I don't like it,

13:40.360 --> 13:42.874
Maybe we could just
take it down a little, you know?

13:44.320 --> 13:45.673
I worked really hard on this.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.830
- I know you did, like I said...
- And you hate it!

13:48.680 --> 13:51.433
I don't hate it,
I just want something simple.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.474
This is simple.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.314
Brooke, you're putting feathers on it.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.029
Fine.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.269
You know what?
Why don't you wear that stupid hat

13:59.160 --> 14:01.435
and poncho of yours, for all I care.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.710
- Brooke, there's no need to get nasty...
- No?

14:05.680 --> 14:08.114
You can insult my fashion sense
but I can't insult yours?

14:08.160 --> 14:10.549
Brooke, all I'm saying is I want
something closer to the picture.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.635
Right, closer to the picture.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.069
Okay, so if you wanna go shopping
and buy a new wedding dress,

14:15.200 --> 14:16.952
why don't you go to Slut Barn?

14:17.680 --> 14:19.159
I'm sure they're having a sale.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.269
Well, you would know, wouldn't you?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.430
You told Lucas that you loved him?

14:23.200 --> 14:24.997
It was the school shooting, okay?

14:25.240 --> 14:27.435
And I was bleeding
and I thought I was gonna die.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.110
I didn't mean it like that.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.629
- Jake, I love you.
- I know that you do.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.474
Well, then why are you making
such a big deal about this?

14:59.160 --> 15:01.549
When you decided that
you weren't gonna go back to Tree Hill,

15:02.200 --> 15:04.111
- do you remember what you told me?
- Yeah.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.797
You said that your father's not around,

15:08.600 --> 15:12.593
that Haley has Nathan
and that Brooke has Lucas.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.719
Okay, you know what?
Haley and Brooke are my best friends.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.798
And they spend a lot of time
with their boyfriends,

15:15.040 --> 15:16.393
that's all I meant by that.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.156
Let me ask you a question.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.910
What if Brooke didn't have Lucas?

15:23.640 --> 15:24.914
<i>"In the days before the wedding,</i>

15:25.080 --> 15:28.789
<i>"the King surprised the Princess</i>
<i>and gave his blessing to the marriage.</i>

15:27.880 --> 15:29.871
<i>"But the Princess was still torn.</i>

15:38.560 --> 15:40.437
<i>"For even though</i>
<i>she had found her true love,</i>

15:39.920 --> 15:43.913
<i>"it meant she would have to leave</i>
<i>her faithful handmaiden behind forever. "</i>

15:43.720 --> 15:45.517
Hi, only-friend-l-can-trust.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.518
Whoa, what's wrong?

15:47.760 --> 15:50.752
- Did you break up with Pete?
- I didn't go to see Pete.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.519
When I left this weekend,
I went to go see Jake.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.116
Oh, my God!

15:58.440 --> 16:00.396
But that's a good thing, right?

16:02.560 --> 16:03.913
<i>Don't you see, Peyton?</i>

16:06.280 --> 16:09.556
You asked me to marry you
after Jenny called you "Mama."

16:09.920 --> 16:11.148
Yeah.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.075
After you lost your mom again.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.430
- I mean, your dad's not around...
- You know what? Don't...

16:17.720 --> 16:19.995
You're alone, Peyton, I get it!

16:19.160 --> 16:21.720
It makes all the sense in the world
that you would want a family.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.394
- No. I want this family.
- Do you?

16:23.960 --> 16:26.394
Okay, you know what? Just don't...

16:26.760 --> 16:27.909
I don't understand this, okay?

16:29.400 --> 16:32.198
'Cause it seems like you're working
really, really hard to push me away.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.719
- So if you're not into me, just say so.
- No, that is not it.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.477
I love you, Peyton. Okay?

16:37.840 --> 16:40.434
I don't want to believe
that there's another guy in your heart.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.871
- But I think that there is.
- I think that you're afraid.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.795
Yeah, you know what? I am afraid.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.278
It hurt like hell
the last time I lost you and I...

16:48.080 --> 16:49.991
I don't want to do that again.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.469
Then don't.

16:53.840 --> 16:54.829
Look.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.552
Marriages fall apart all the time

16:59.880 --> 17:02.474
because people,
they get caught up with the romance

17:04.440 --> 17:06.396
and they're not honest with themselves.

17:08.079 --> 17:10.195
Well, I have to be twice as honest.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.751
Once for me. And once for Jenny.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.192
Whoa! Anyone I know?

17:14.480 --> 17:16.516
Mostly me. I talked to Brooke today.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.749
Oh, boy.

17:29.400 --> 17:35.589
I have never seen someone go
from so thrilled to so hurt

17:31.960 --> 17:34.030
to really mean so quickly.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.833
- And that was just me.
- I'm sorry, Hales.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.876
Hey, you'll never guess
who I ran into today.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.430
- Marcus.
- Marcus from the Tutor Center, Marcus?

17:45.520 --> 17:47.909
Yeah. You know he dropped out of school?

17:48.520 --> 17:51.751
I ran into Dan today.
Who do you think's the bigger ass?

17:50.720 --> 17:53.393
Actually, he seemed like
he was really affected by the whole thing.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.633
Like maybe
he was trying to change because of it.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.031
Actually, I was gonna
say the same thing about Dan.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.510
- Believe it or not.
- Not.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.237
But I was thinking about inviting him
to the wedding and dinner tonight.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.238
- Dan?
- No, Marcus.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.274
I mean, I'd love to include my dad,
but I know he'd just screw it up.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.511
There's still hope for Marcus.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.712
And just a reminder, you still
gotta pick out our first dance song.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.557
I know. I have it narrowed down to three.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.993
Oh, cool. I'll tell you what.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.712
You give me those three songs,
I'll surprise you on the day.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.518
- Okay, that sounds fun!
- All right.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.114
Now, what are you gonna do
about Brooke?

18:30.120 --> 18:33.874
I mean, besides pretending
that she's a speed bag and wailing on her?

18:33.200 --> 18:36.112
I am going to apologize
and hope she forgives me.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.228
That's my girl.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.910
Literature. You asked me about my future.

18:42.280 --> 18:46.796
And if I could go to any college,
it would be UNC to study literature.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.275
My son, the next great American author.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.991
I don't know about that, Ma.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.872
- And UNC would be your dream school?
- Yeah, sure.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.311
I mean, if we had the money.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.073
Okay, listen to me.

19:06.240 --> 19:10.313
Before we left, the lawyer
who drew up the adoption papers called.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.992
He told me that ever since you were born,

19:13.840 --> 19:16.798
Keith has been saving
a fund for you, for college.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.071
I didn't know about it myself.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.475
He dreamed your dream with you, Lucas.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.552
And if this is something
that you really want,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.675
and you have the grades,
then you can have it.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.311
Because Keith left it for you.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.118
God, I miss him so much.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.673
He's always with you.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.309
Always.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.353
You make him proud.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.954
I will.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.475
I totally lost my mind
and went off on Haley.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.519
I called her a slut.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.152
You know what? I'm proud of you, Davis.

20:09.280 --> 20:10.918
Helping Haley find another dress...

20:11.560 --> 20:13.073
Oh, no, we're not shopping for her.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.111
We're shopping because I feel miserable
and this is therapy.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.709
Brooke.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.351
See! All better. Be right back.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.075
Rachel?

20:22.280 --> 20:24.032
He said he liked me.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.431
I need him to like me.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.149
<i>"On the eve of the Princess's wedding,</i>
<i>a lavish feast was arranged.</i>

20:58.960 --> 21:01.394
<i>"Friends and royalty were summoned</i>
<i>from lands far away</i>

21:02.280 --> 21:06.114
<i>"to join the happy couple</i>
<i>for a night of laughter and magic. "</i>

21:07.720 --> 21:11.679
Well, well. As usual, Brooke Davis
shows up when all the work is done.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.273
Sorry. I had some things
I had to deal with.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.794
Speaking of, you never told me
how everything ended up with Jake.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.469
Just not what I wanted it to be.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.794
I think I'm gonna go hide the knives.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.437
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.118
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.114
I'm sorry.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.513
I was being selfish
and I wasn't listening to you and I...

21:47.920 --> 21:50.309
I was so wrapped up
in what I wanted that dress to be

21:52.920 --> 21:54.911
that I freaked out a little bit.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.951
I would love to wear your dress.

21:57.800 --> 21:58.915
That's really nice,

22:00.280 --> 22:03.670
but I think you might wanna save the love
until after dinner tonight.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.792
You know all those questions
I've been asking you

22:05.720 --> 22:07.995
- about the early days of Naley?
- Yeah.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.275
You didn't think I really wanted
to know all that stuff, did you?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.992
- Yes.
- No.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.879
I was just gathering material.
See you tonight.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.434
- It's really filling up out there.
- Really? Thank God, I was worried.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.316
Apparently there's a flu going around
and everybody's dropping like flies, so...

22:18.720 --> 22:21.473
Well, Lucas should be back any second.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.955
- You excited?
- Yeah, I am.

22:36.600 --> 22:41.390
But I don't know, it's kind of strange,
I realized since he's been gone that

22:39.960 --> 22:42.474
I'm not as dependent on him as I thought.

22:42.800 --> 22:47.112
You know, I have my clothing line
and I have my friends and I have me.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.789
And I'm not such bad company.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.108
Who knew?

22:53.480 --> 22:55.550
Peyton, Naley's here.

22:58.400 --> 22:59.435
Okay.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.475
Brooke.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.598
You're the best company.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.994
Believe that.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.474
"Once upon a time, a girl and a boy..." No.

23:14.880 --> 23:19.829
"Once upon a time in a land far, far away,
a girl and a boy fell in love."

23:16.760 --> 23:19.399
- Hey, pretty girl.
- Hi, boyfriend.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.828
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.598
This place looks great.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.308
- You did good, Brooke.
- Yeah, I know I did.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.757
Peyton and some other people helped,
but it was mostly me.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.394
Small problem.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.758
Skills is sick and he's supposed to be
in that first scene with me.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.839
Fergie said he'd stand in for him,

24:09.920 --> 24:11.797
but I don't think
anyone's gonna buy him as Nathan

24:12.080 --> 24:15.277
'cause, you know, his hair.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.316
You know what? I think it's gonna be fine.
Just give him a set of lines.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.238
Lucas, here's yours. It's showtime.

24:18.320 --> 24:21.118
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>in a kingdom far, far away</i>

24:25.200 --> 24:27.111
<i>a girl and a boy fell in love.</i>

24:28.640 --> 24:30.756
<i>And then another girl, supposedly a friend,</i>

24:44.360 --> 24:48.239
<i>secretly taped how they fell in love</i>
<i>and decided to use it against them.</i>

24:47.240 --> 24:51.677
<i>So tonight I give you an authentic</i>
<i>and very unauthorized reenactment</i>

24:50.520 --> 24:53.034
of"Nathan and Haley, A Fairy Tale."

24:52.720 --> 24:55.188
She's wearing my poncho! Hey!

25:00.520 --> 25:02.158
Oh, my God!

25:05.040 --> 25:08.316
So you're Nathan Scott,
Mr. Big Shot basketball player.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.630
I don't trust you
and I'm totally not into you.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.635
And I'm just tutoring you

25:25.240 --> 25:27.959
so that you'll leave my best friend,
Lucas, alone.

25:28.600 --> 25:32.149
Damn, baby, that is one ugly-ass poncho.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.273
Yo, check it out.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.190
Don't say I never gave you no bling.

25:37.640 --> 25:38.914
Listen, Nathan.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.840
I know you collapsed
on the basketball court tonight,

25:51.800 --> 25:54.519
so I was thinking
maybe you wanted to stay the night

26:13.400 --> 26:15.391
and get a little freaky.

26:14.760 --> 26:15.988
How about this?

26:17.400 --> 26:18.469
Okay.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.758
This is not how it happened!

26:26.040 --> 26:28.395
- Yes, yes, it did.
- No. No, shut up!

26:32.360 --> 26:35.989
- What's wrong, Haley?
- I just wanna go home to my own room.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.352
I'm not a wife.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.515
I'm not even a senior.

26:46.400 --> 26:50.678
I'll always be there for you, Mrs. Scott.
I mean, Haley.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.111
Always and forever.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.036
<i>It seems that</i>
<i>there's a bit of a bug going around</i>

26:56.760 --> 26:58.751
<i>and we've lost a few performers.</i>

27:01.400 --> 27:05.678
<i>So I was wondering if in this next scene</i>
<i>Nathan wanted to play himself?</i>

27:11.520 --> 27:14.318
- What? No!
- Come on, come on.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.597
You're gonna wake my parents.
That's their room.

27:15.640 --> 27:16.914
Look, Haley.

27:20.000 --> 27:20.989
Oh, no.

27:49.680 --> 27:51.398
That is not in the script.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.438
You missed a few lines.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.795
Gosh.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.874
I think I messed up. We better start over.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.598
You come back down.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.317
I decided to go for a run
and I ended up here.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.878
Boy, is it raining out.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.989
- I'm mad at you, Nathan Scott.
- Haley, please listen to me.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.275
I know I'm a porn freak.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.029
Hey!

28:41.800 --> 28:44.678
Nathan, it's okay. I like my porn, too.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.749
And I "Haley" myself from time to time.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.952
But I still need to know that you love me.

28:50.880 --> 28:54.077
Someday, I'm gonna marry you,
Haley James.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.079
Someday.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.592
Peyton, I'm sorry. I don't want you to go.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.629
But your father told you
to follow your heart and he's right.

29:08.680 --> 29:12.798
And as much as it kills me to say it,
I think you need to follow it home.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.676
But what if you're wrong?

29:24.560 --> 29:29.236
What if I go back and my heart just
aches for you like it has for months now?

29:28.360 --> 29:30.271
Well, then I'll still be here.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.433
And if it's meant to be, we'll be together.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.559
Someday.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.389
<i>"As the night wore on,</i>

29:45.240 --> 29:48.789
<i>"a calm fell upon the land</i>
<i>and all was right in the world.</i>

29:49.600 --> 29:51.272
<i>"If only for a moment."</i>

29:56.160 --> 29:57.479
Oh, my God!

29:57.320 --> 29:59.595
I would strangle you
if this wasn't so awesome.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.315
Thank you, thank you,
and thanks for being my maid of honor.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.310
- It really means a lot to me.
- You're welcome.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.871
- Thank you for being cool about the dress.
- Oh, yeah, no problem.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.035
Listen, Rachel's here.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.032
Can you just try
not to kill each other, okay?

30:15.600 --> 30:18.114
- Yeah. I actually invited her.
- You what?

30:18.920 --> 30:20.114
Long story.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.314
How's the hand?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.597
Kind of gross, actually.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.709
Thanks for covering for me at the store.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.079
Sure, mirrors just break all the time.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.758
I didn't even tell Peyton.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.951
- As long as you're okay.
- Brooke.

30:43.080 --> 30:47.039
I broke the glass because
I was mad at myself for lying to Cooper.

30:47.400 --> 30:51.234
I mean, I know I just met him,
but I really liked him,

30:52.240 --> 30:55.038
and now he doesn't
want to see me anymore.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.994
That sucks.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.079
I'm sorry.

31:05.840 --> 31:08.559
Why? I mean, you and me...

31:10.840 --> 31:12.239
Why are you sorry?

31:12.640 --> 31:15.996
Because I know what it feels like
to have your heart broken.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.752
And I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.674
- Not even your worst enemy?
- Not even her.

31:26.560 --> 31:30.519
- Hey, you showed up, man.
- Yeah, what the hell, dude?

31:31.520 --> 31:32.555
If this is your history,

31:33.280 --> 31:35.555
I can't figure out
how you ever got married the first time.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.229
Hey. I thought you snuck off with Gigi.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.632
Hales, you remember Marcus, right?

31:54.080 --> 31:56.435
- Yes, I do. Nice to see you.
- Hey.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.510
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.953
So Nathan says you dropped out of school.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.157
Yeah, well, I kind of
had a lot of stuff to deal with, you know?

32:03.800 --> 32:06.553
And besides,
my grades pretty much sucked, anyway.

32:08.400 --> 32:12.552
Yeah, I think... I think we all had
a lot to deal with after that day.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.434
I can make you an offer, actually.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.669
I mean, if you wanna come back to school,
I'll tutor you.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.071
Yeah. She's a great tutor, man.
She makes it all really easy.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.509
- I'll think about it, okay?
- Okay.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.515
Thanks for coming.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.791
- Take it easy, man.
- Bye, guys.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.396
That was really nice of you, Haley.

32:37.880 --> 32:41.077
You know, even though
two people lost their lives that day,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.231
maybe in some strange way,
other people found theirs.

32:44.320 --> 32:47.630
Okay, P. Sawyer, last scene of the night.
Are we good?

32:48.080 --> 32:51.038
- Actually, no. Mouth is sick, too.
- What?

32:51.600 --> 32:53.556
But we need him for this scene.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.191
I mean, Luke, you could do it.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.315
- Maybe we should just cut the night short.
- No, we can't. This is the big finale.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.353
Please, Lucas?

33:10.840 --> 33:13.559
- Okay. But no wig.
- Deal. Those are your lines.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.954
I can buy you guys a couple of minutes.
Just ad lib if you get in trouble, okay?

33:17.720 --> 33:20.712
- You do know what scene this is, right?
- No, why?

33:19.520 --> 33:20.748
<i>Before we end the night,</i>

33:22.360 --> 33:25.557
<i>I just wanted to say a few words</i>
<i>about Nathan and Haley.</i>

33:29.080 --> 33:32.072
<i>I told them once, not long ago,</i>
<i>to be happy,</i>

33:42.360 --> 33:45.033
<i>because someday</i>
<i>they'd make us all believe in true love.</i>

33:43.680 --> 33:44.795
<i>And they do.</i>

33:46.960 --> 33:49.599
<i>In a few days, they're gonna</i>
<i>renew that love for all of us to see.</i>

33:50.040 --> 33:52.474
<i>But in a way, we see it every day.</i>

33:52.800 --> 33:54.756
<i>The only difference</i>
<i>is that Haley will look fabulous</i>

33:54.320 --> 33:56.390
<i>in her wedding dress</i>
<i>by Clothes Over Bro's</i>

33:57.040 --> 33:59.952
<i>which is kind of odd</i>
<i>seeing as she's marrying a Bro.</i>

33:59.600 --> 34:01.875
<i>But that's not the point. Sorry.</i>

34:01.640 --> 34:05.030
<i>One rainy day,</i>
<i>Nathan Scott proposed to Haley James.</i>

34:03.800 --> 34:05.631
<i>And the rest is a fairy tale.</i>

34:07.320 --> 34:09.469
<i>This is the last scene of the night.</i>

34:09.880 --> 34:11.835
Golly gee,
that was some good loving, Haley.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.635
Oh, yes, yes, it was.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.748
So, what are you thinking?

34:25.400 --> 34:28.312
Oh, I was just thinking how I never...

34:27.440 --> 34:29.670
Never want to go home again.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.991
I was just thinking
how I never want to go home again.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.195
I love you. You know that?

34:44.239 --> 34:46.356
Where's your head at, Peyton?

34:49.000 --> 34:53.391
Well, when I went to bed tonight,
I was living a fairy tale

34:54.400 --> 34:57.631
and when I woke up, it's a nightmare.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.598
No, it's still a fairy tale.
Don't give up on that.

35:06.920 --> 35:10.435
But look inside your heart
and ask yourself is Lucas still there.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.358
And if not, I'll be here.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.395
Hey.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.349
I love you.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.994
You know that?

35:41.840 --> 35:45.594
- Everything is gonna be all right, right?
- Yeah. Yeah it is.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.750
You're always saving me.

35:45.960 --> 35:49.430
The truth is, I want all
the same things that you want. I do.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.513
And I want them with you.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.918
I love you, too.

36:04.720 --> 36:07.757
<i>"Once upon a time</i>
<i>in a kingdom far, far away,</i>

36:09.280 --> 36:12.238
<i>"there lived a beautiful Princess</i>
<i>who loved a Boy. "</i>

36:14.520 --> 36:15.509
Rachel.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.673
Are you gonna be okay?

36:22.280 --> 36:23.793
It's his loss, right?

36:36.720 --> 36:40.156
So, thanks for the invite tonight
and the offer.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.308
You know, it's not that easy
to change who you are.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.395
But it helps when people let you try.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.517
- See you.
- See you later, man.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.994
You know,
there's something I'd really like to do.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.916
- Do you mind if I meet you back here?
- No, fine. Go ahead.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.679
- All right.
- See you.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.233

37:36.840 --> 37:38.671
- Haley.
- Hi.

37:50.640 --> 37:51.914
Okay, so the last time

37:54.560 --> 37:56.630
I stood in a doorway
giving someone the benefit of the doubt

37:56.920 --> 38:00.435
when my instincts were screaming at me
not to, it was for Nathan.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.519
And this time,

38:02.960 --> 38:04.791
well, it's still for Nathan.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.709
We would like you
to come to the wedding.

38:06.480 --> 38:09.756
- Thank you.
- But God help you if you don't change.

38:10.480 --> 38:13.199
Hey, Luke, we're taking off.

38:13.320 --> 38:16.630
- But it's great to have you back, man.
- Hey, thanks, bud.

38:15.840 --> 38:19.355
Yeah, the team misses you, Luke.
Take care of yourself.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.636
Hey, catch you guys soon, all right?

38:30.800 --> 38:33.837
- Happy to be back?
- Yeah. It's good to be home.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.794
<i>"But in the end,</i>

38:37.000 --> 38:40.629

Way to go with the tears, P. Sawyer!
You brought down the house.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.669
Brooke.

39:44.440 --> 39:46.829
I think I still have feelings for Lucas.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.311
You mean you care for him

40:11.000 --> 40:12.353
as a friend?

40:14.360 --> 40:15.429
No.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.991
I mean more than that.
