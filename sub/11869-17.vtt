00:01.293 --> 00:02.874
CARTER: Previously
on Eureka...

00:05.005 --> 00:07.997
I was naive to think
I could justjump
into this marriage.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.715
I'm not your Henry.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.256
Not yet.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.798
Now, ifl can't be
with you on Titan,

00:14.932 --> 00:16.297
I'll be right here
in mission control

00:16.433 --> 00:17.764
watching you
every second.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.303
So go.
On one condition.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.229
Marry me,
Henry Deacon?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.344
Absolutely.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.688
How's it going?
Senator Wen
just left.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.850
And she's recommending
a full pardon for me.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.942
From now on,
ifl stay in Eureka,

00:30.072 --> 00:31.562
it'll be because
I wanna be.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.855
Okay, listen,
if we're gonna be
working together,

00:33.992 --> 00:35.368
and sleeping together,

00:35.536 --> 00:37.072
things are gonna
get complicated,

00:37.329 --> 00:38.409
Jack.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.987
Oh, I can handle
complicated.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.497
FARGO: Follow my lead.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.370
Titan's beautiful
but dangerous.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.972
Core sample,
marker five Delta.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.088
Five Delta.
Copy that.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.859
Come here often?

01:15.325 --> 01:16.314
(LAUGHS)

01:17.661 --> 01:18.821
(GASPING)

01:18.954 --> 01:20.444
Oh, ammonia plume!

01:21.248 --> 01:22.158
(ALARMS BLARING)
Frak!

01:22.291 --> 01:23.451
Sorry, Holly!

01:23.959 --> 01:25.870
My suit!
It's losing pressure!

01:26.003 --> 01:27.368
No, no, no,
we just have to
re-calibrate the...

01:27.671 --> 01:29.536
Oh, I'm sorry, Holly!

01:30.090 --> 01:31.705
I'm so sorry, Holly.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.002
COMPUTER VOICE: Sim

01:33.135 --> 01:35.217
HUGGINS: My snowflakes
are still too small.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.008
Stand-by.

01:39.141 --> 01:42.383
COMPUTER VOICE:

537 terminated.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.981
(WHOOSHING)

01:48.317 --> 01:50.182
Goof around
like that on Titan,

01:50.319 --> 01:51.934
and you're dead.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.856
Easy, Huggins.
We've been at this
all morning.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.775
I'm just
a little punchy.
Yeah.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.647
And do you really
need to vent
the environment

01:57.784 --> 01:58.864
after every
test run?

01:58.994 --> 02:00.325
It has to be perfect.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.444
I agree.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.616
So let's go again.

02:03.749 --> 02:07.287
Can't. I'm off
to the B.C.E.
to welcome home Tiny.

02:08.003 --> 02:10.039
Our little lady
is due back
from Titan.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.581
I wouldn't use
the words little
or lady

02:13.717 --> 02:14.923
to describe Tiny.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.838
Are we not fond
of the Titan rover?

02:17.429 --> 02:19.761
We were almost
vaporized by
the Titan rover.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.137
HUGGINS: Okay, that was
a software glitch.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.722
Tiny's my hero.

02:22.851 --> 02:23.636
She's bringing
back samples

02:23.769 --> 02:28.980
that” help me
replicate the conditions
on Titan precisely.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.392
FARGO: Huggins?

02:30.525 --> 02:31.935
You need to
get out more.
(LAUGHING)

02:32.194 --> 02:34.526
Yeah, and you need
to stop flirting, okay?

02:34.946 --> 02:37.528
All the other
Astraeus candidates
are focused on the mission.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.947
A dash of nitrogen
and some phosphorus...

02:47.876 --> 02:49.582
These lily hybrids
are totally unique.

02:49.961 --> 02:53.124
Trust me, no one
is gonna have
centerpieces like yours.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.377
HENRY: Wow.
GRACE: Whoa.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.499
(BOTH LAUGH)

02:58.428 --> 03:00.805
I don't usually offer
my botanical research

03:00.931 --> 03:02.592
for personal use, but...

03:02.724 --> 03:03.930
I'm a sucker
for weddings.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.888
Hey! Best man, here,
reporting for duty.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.806
Oh, well, best man,

03:08.939 --> 03:11.055
I suggest you
prepare a toast
this time.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.397
Last time,
you rambled.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.683
I did?

03:14.820 --> 03:16.060
Like it was open
mic night.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.233
Oh, and don't,
lose the rings again.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.281
I lost the rings?

03:22.411 --> 03:23.400
So I hear.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.492
Which reminds me,

03:24.621 --> 03:25.827
we need to choose
new ones.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.581
But... Um, what's...

03:30.001 --> 03:31.832
I mean,
what's wrong
with these?

03:31.962 --> 03:32.826
Nothing.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.123
But this time's
different,

03:34.256 --> 03:35.996
so new beginning,
new rings.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.461
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.254
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.928
So how you been,
Shenﬁ?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.764
Oh, can't complain,
can't complain.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.101
Nice... Nice blooms
you got.
Thank you.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.225
ALLISON: Jack.
Yep? Hey.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.306
Okay, I don't want you
to get all worked up...

03:54.484 --> 03:55.940
Oh, this doesn't
sound good.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.814
Just consider it
a temporary nuisance.

03:57.946 --> 03:58.856
Now that
we're involved,

03:58.989 --> 04:01.822
I had to file
an LA. 248
with the DOD.

04:01.950 --> 04:02.814
An |.A.?

04:02.951 --> 04:05.237
It's the form
required for our
"intimate alliance."

04:05.370 --> 04:06.610
There can't be
a form for that!

04:06.747 --> 04:08.487
Normally, it's
a formality, but...

04:08.623 --> 04:10.488
Given what happened
to me recently
on your watch,

04:11.460 --> 04:13.701
well, our relationship
has been red-flagged.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.707
Our relationship's
been red-flagged?

04:16.840 --> 04:19.172
Because of our high rank,
the DOD. is concerned.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.133
They have sent
a relationship auditor
to assess us.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.089
Assess us for what?

04:24.765 --> 04:25.925
National security.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.434
Hello, Sheriff.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.845
Warren Hughes.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.309
Warren...

04:31.938 --> 04:34.930
"Ph.D., M.A., C.P.A."

04:35.567 --> 04:37.683
I cover all
the bases.
Mmm.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.150
So, as I've told
Dr. Blake,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.816
I'm here pursuant to
an LA. 248 filing.

04:42.324 --> 04:46.237
Well, Warren,
how do you "assess"
an intimate alliance?

04:46.953 --> 04:48.284
I like to watch.

04:48.955 --> 04:49.819
You... You...

04:49.956 --> 04:51.492
Oh, I don't mean
"watch" watch.

04:51.958 --> 04:52.947
(LAUGHS)

04:56.463 --> 04:59.830
No, you two just
carry on, go about
your business,

04:59.966 --> 05:02.548
and, pretend
I'm not even here.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.393
Who is he
to judge us?

05:14.523 --> 05:15.478
What, is he
some sort of

05:15.607 --> 05:17.143
mid-level paper pusher
from D.O.D.?

05:17.901 --> 05:20.358
Actually, our office
intends to go

05:20.487 --> 05:23.103
entirely paperless
by 2016.
Yeah?

05:23.615 --> 05:25.105
I'm vice chair
of the Green Team.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.823
All we have to do
is keep it professional.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.533
Oh, so no groping?
Is that...

05:28.662 --> 05:30.493
Let's just get
through the day.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.075
Fortunately, it looks like
it's gonna be a quiet one.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.033
So, Dr. Blake,
exactly what's
happening here?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.080
Well, Tiny,
our robot rover,

05:38.380 --> 05:40.621
has just finished
building a site
just like this on Titan

05:40.757 --> 05:43.043
to facilitate our
faster than light travel.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.880
And she's bringing back
soil and air samples

05:46.096 --> 05:49.384
so I can recreate
the perfect ethane fog,
hydrocarbon lakes,

05:49.516 --> 05:50.471
methane burps.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.589
Sounds delightful.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.717
Yeah. The next best thing
to being on Titan.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.970
Our Astraeus team
will be prepared
for anything,

05:56.106 --> 05:59.269
which includes
traveling via FTL,
just like Tiny.

05:59.734 --> 06:00.814
You don't wanna miss it.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.935
Trust me,
I never miss a thing.

06:03.947 --> 06:04.982
ALLISON: Oh.
Great.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.445
Henry, uh,
Dr. Deacon,

06:13.915 --> 06:16.292
commence return
course sequence.

Let's bring her home.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.161

06:26.928 --> 06:28.213
(LOW RUMBLING)

06:30.765 --> 06:31.754
(CHUCKLING)

06:34.352 --> 06:35.512
Easy!

06:35.645 --> 06:37.055
Ah, she's just
getting her bearings.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.473
It's been
a rigorous
assignment.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.318
She's sweet!

06:42.986 --> 06:44.942
Hey, welcome home, girl!

06:47.073 --> 06:48.449
I got dibs
on her samples.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.783
Hang on! I've gotta
deactivate her
de-pressurization shield.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.111
Shield's clearing
in three,

06:55.081 --> 06:56.457
two, one.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.510
He needs a CT.
for blunt force trauma,

07:14.643 --> 07:15.928
possible concussion.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.684
Mr. Hughes.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.804
Are you okay?
Well, my ears
are ringing.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.397
CARTER: Yeah, exploding
robots will do that.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.983
It's tinnitus.
It's a result
of the blast.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.727
It's usually
temporary.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.274
It's usually?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.111
I'm... I'm so sorry.
We will take care of you.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.733
I'll live.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.737
Now I can watch you
and Sheriff Carter
handle a crisis.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.451
One second
she was here,
and the next...

07:41.127 --> 07:42.082
What happened?

07:42.212 --> 07:44.624
Well, I won't know
until I examine
her remains.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.584
Oh, I'm sorry...
ALLISON: Any theories,
Dr. Deacon?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.628
Well, Dr. Blake,
um...

07:50.470 --> 07:52.802
There is a strong
methane presence
on Titan,

07:52.931 --> 07:55.547
as a gas,
as a liquid,
and as a solid.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.932
Now, Tiny was in
prolonged contact.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.972
So she may have
somehow absorbed

08:00.105 --> 08:01.686
a dangerously
high concentration.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.770
If that's the case,

08:02.899 --> 08:04.890
once I deactivated her
de-pressurization shield,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.768
the tiniest of sparks
could've caused her
to explode.

08:07.946 --> 08:08.981
This is a disaster.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.949
l was counting
on those samples.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.278
Well, hopefully her
containment unit
is still intact.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.705
(SIGHS)
Sheriff Carter.
Shenﬁ?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.787
I need you
to check the area.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.077
Oh, come on.
This thing's probably
blown halfway to...

08:23.420 --> 08:25.251
Um...yeah.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.787
I will do that,
Dr. Blake.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.131
Well, I'll come
with you.
We can chat.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.549
Fantastic.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.885
But...

08:35.306 --> 08:36.512
Please.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.398
It's okay.
You can look.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.275
What? No, no,
I wasn't trying to...

08:49.821 --> 08:51.311
Doug, we might
spend six months

08:51.448 --> 08:52.779
in close quarters
together.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.530
You're bound
to see me in
my skivvies.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.900
Okay.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.194
For the mission.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.289
Which brings up
something else.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.624
Um, ex...excuse me?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.463
We failed
at our last
simulation.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.788
Uh, yeah, my bad.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.172
I was just distracted,
you know, because
you're so...

09:13.011 --> 09:14.046
Distracti ng.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.385
Hence our problem.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.090
And I think I have
a solution.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.429
Just the two of us,

09:19.809 --> 09:21.140
we need to spend
some time together,

09:21.269 --> 09:23.726
just getting to know
each other, talking...

09:24.397 --> 09:26.433
Talking. Okay,
that's one approach.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.023
What... What did you
have in mind?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.779
l was thinking that,
um, we...

09:31.905 --> 09:33.020
We should
just have sex.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.233
Our budding urges

09:35.366 --> 09:37.322
are interfering
with our professional
ambitions.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.323
Wait. "Our" urges?
You mean,
like, mutual?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.570
Definitely,
so that's why

09:42.707 --> 09:44.163
I think the most
sensible course
of action

09:44.292 --> 09:45.372
is to satisfy them.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.288
What, now?
Yeah.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.039
The sooner we consummate,
the sooner we concentrate.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.545
(PAGER BEEPING)

09:52.509 --> 09:53.624
Uh-oh.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.341
We have
a Tiny problem.
Oh.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.174
Oh, no!
Tiny, the robot.
She exploded.

09:58.807 --> 09:59.717
Yeah, I have to go
look into it.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.807
All right,
well, rain check?
Tonight?

10:03.228 --> 10:04.843
Absolutely.
All right.

10:06.898 --> 10:07.933
Okay.

10:11.861 --> 10:15.570
Sign here and,
uh, here.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.738
Initial here and...

10:21.704 --> 10:22.989
We're done.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.071
(LAUGHS)

10:25.458 --> 10:26.493
So that's it.

10:27.836 --> 10:28.951
It's official?

10:29.420 --> 10:30.830
Full and complete pardon.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.877
Well, thank you
very much, Jo.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.842
Forget it.

10:41.516 --> 10:44.258
You know,
it must be a sad day
for you, though.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.558
I mean, I know
how much you love
locking me up.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.141
Oh, I still can
if you misbehave.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.099
Only if it's
on your turf.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.021
I can go anywhere now.
I'm a free man.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.025
So does that mean
you're leaving?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.281
Maybe. Who knows?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.075
And if! do,
this could be
the last time

11:03.204 --> 11:05.069
we ever see
each other.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.454
So what are
your intentions?

11:15.300 --> 11:18.292
Well, my intentions
are to find these

11:18.428 --> 11:20.464
scientifically
fascinating samples.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.595
No, I meant
with Dr. Blake.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.513
My intention is
to continue to enjoy
our relationship.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.144
Which you would
consider to be

11:30.273 --> 11:32.389
"A, a fling,

11:33.234 --> 11:35.646
"B, friends
with benefits,

11:36.070 --> 11:38.812
"C, leading to
a serious commitment,"

11:39.282 --> 11:41.113
or "D, other"?

11:43.828 --> 11:45.534
E. None of
your business.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.163
Well, now, Sheriff,
you're obliged
to respond,

11:49.626 --> 11:51.833
as per section
QV6...

11:53.046 --> 11:54.456
Holy smoke.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.122
What is that?

12:02.847 --> 12:06.089
I guess some pieces
of Tiny started a fire.
Wait here.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.845
Oh, penny candy.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.934
You're not gonna
get rid of me
that easily.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.481
Poor Tiny.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.682
The CH4 concentration
is more than 3,000 P.P.M.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.479
It's like she was
saturated with methane.

12:17.862 --> 12:18.942
Which means
we definitely
have to rethink

12:19.072 --> 12:20.983
the filtration for
the Astraeus habitat.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.941
Tiny, you didn't
blow up for nothing.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.033
Henry, I have to ask,

12:30.166 --> 12:32.122
are you okay
with getting married?

12:32.710 --> 12:34.086
l... I couldn't
be happier.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.668
It's just...

12:38.549 --> 12:39.584
Are... Are you okay?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.674
I asked you to marry me,
remember?

12:42.887 --> 12:44.627
So, adios, Tiny.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.300
And where have
you been?

12:46.641 --> 12:48.006
Oh, I was tangled up
with Zane.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.469
With his thing.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.759
His pardon thing.

12:51.896 --> 12:56.731
Uh, so, you guys
must be swamped
with wedding plans.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.023
Need any help?

12:58.152 --> 13:00.564
Oh, no, no, it'sjust
an intimate party
with friends.

13:00.697 --> 13:01.857
No fuss.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.689
Yeah, but you guys
are making a commitment
to each other.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.112
You gotta go all out,
you know, big and splashy.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.860
Oh, we're gonna
go all out.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.862
Small and simple.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.864
Huh.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.833
WARREN: The smoke seems
to be gone, Sheriff.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.791
Keen eye, Warren.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.376
Oh, is that
the containment unit?

13:26.389 --> 13:27.720
Yeah, it looks like.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.306
I mean, it might've
sprung a leak...

13:31.019 --> 13:32.134
Ooh!

13:33.521 --> 13:35.182
My eyes are starting
to sting.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.316
I don't think
we should be here.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.682
I could give you
a lift home.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.811
You wanna give
a mid-level paper pusher
a ride home?

13:43.239 --> 13:44.649
I knew that
was gonna haunt me.

13:46.868 --> 13:47.857
Oh.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.526
Sheriff, is that
a part of your robot?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.201
Wait, what is that?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.323
A foot?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.002
Yeah, just don't
touch anything, okay?

13:57.128 --> 13:58.208
Mmm.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.875
(GROUND RUMBLING)

14:15.813 --> 14:16.802
(SCREAMING)

14:20.651 --> 14:21.731
WARREN: (SHOUTING)
Get me out!

14:21.861 --> 14:22.816
Warren!

14:22.945 --> 14:24.856
Ah! I've gotcha.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.400
Don't let go!

14:29.452 --> 14:31.283
(BOTH GRUNTING)

14:33.873 --> 14:35.534
(GASPING)

14:37.877 --> 14:39.242
You picked
a bad day
for an audit.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.713
The earth just
opened up
and swallowed me.

14:43.841 --> 14:44.751
It was horrible.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.169
I'm just glad
that you're okay.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.967
Oh, I'm...
I'm fine, too,
over here.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.086
Just if you were...

14:50.390 --> 14:52.096
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

14:53.643 --> 14:54.758
Sure.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.056
You almost broke
the auditor.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.020
The sinkhole
wasn't my fault.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.731
Can you please be
more cautious?

15:01.859 --> 15:03.019
This assessment
is serious.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.152
This assessment
is ridiculous.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.109
You run G.D.
I protect the town.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.900
After hours,
when I get lucky,
we sleep together.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.200
Shh!

15:13.454 --> 15:14.864
Jack,shh!
Looklook”

15:15.623 --> 15:16.783
What are you writing?

15:17.708 --> 15:19.573
Just a few notes.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.617
Please, carry on.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.874
Just... Just...
Jack, um...

15:24.173 --> 15:25.162
I'll give you notes.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.880
Why don't you go
check in with Henry

15:27.009 --> 15:28.465
and see what progress
he's made?

15:31.889 --> 15:34.551
I'm... Check in
with Henry
and see what

15:34.809 --> 15:35.798
progress he's made.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.726
Testy, isn't he?

15:39.856 --> 15:42.598
Actually, he is
the most level-headed,
even-tempered person

15:42.733 --> 15:44.724
in a town full
of huge egos.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.647
Oh, do you have
a huge ego?

15:50.741 --> 15:51.696
Yes.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.408
Do you really see
a future together?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.824
I don't know.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.579
Why, what did
Jack say?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.791
I won't say anything.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.084
Dr. Blake, I mean,
you have to admit,

16:04.630 --> 16:07.372
the two of you
do make a strange
combination.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.506
Here you are,

16:09.760 --> 16:13.719
in charge of some
of the most brilliant
scientists in the world.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.588
I mean, you're
a genius!

16:16.100 --> 16:18.842
And Sheriff Carter is,
well, you know...

16:19.020 --> 16:21.352
Jack Carter
may not have
a bunch of degrees,

16:21.647 --> 16:23.603
but in many ways,
he is the smartest man
that I know.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.854
Hyper-defensive.
That's interesting.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.439
Excuse me.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.908
IbeHeve,
the orange fog
you saw

16:37.038 --> 16:39.620
was primarily
composed of ethane.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.866
But I thought
methane's what
made Tiny explode.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.209
It did.
Both compounds
are prevalent on Titan.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.703
Oh, so the samples
are leaking.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.248
Possibly, but
the protective seal
appears not to be broken.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.001
Sorry to interrupt,
but Grace,

16:53.137 --> 16:54.718
I've been doing
a bit of reading,

16:54.847 --> 16:57.839
and it seems that
people tie their weddings
together with a theme,

16:58.309 --> 17:00.550
like vintage glamour
or country charm.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.721
Jo?
Yeah.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.310
I appreciate
your enthusiasm...

17:03.439 --> 17:04.849
What were
you thinking
for a gown?

17:05.566 --> 17:06.942
Oh, no, no,
I wasn't gonna wear
anything formal.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.400
Yeah, but I think
that you would look

17:09.529 --> 17:10.860
so beautiful in
something like this.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.944
I think that's
just a bit much.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.564
Martha Stewart,
can I borrow you
for a second?

17:14.700 --> 17:15.689
Yeah.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.953
I think you're going
a little bit overboard.

17:18.621 --> 17:19.736
Carter.
Yeah.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.487
Henry got dumped
into this timeline

17:21.666 --> 17:23.247
married to a woman
he didn't know.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.742
But they still managed
to fall in love.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.460
Okay, now, that is
a new timeline
success story.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.331
It deserves
to be celebrated.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.626
So, Dr. Leonardo
is expecting us
at her lab

17:34.762 --> 17:35.717
to choose flowers.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.461
Oh, no, we already
picked out our flowers.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.840
Yeah, but we
can reconsider.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.437
I think it's cute.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.019
Hacking the mainframe?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.894
Not exactly how
I'd celebrate a pardon
from the Pentagon.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.732
I'm not hacking,
I'm upgrading.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.242
But upgrades
aren't due
till next month.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.734
Well, I wanted
to check off
another item

17:59.870 --> 18:00.996
on my to-do list
before I leave.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.373
Since when
do you have
a to-do list?

18:03.874 --> 18:05.455
And since when
are you leaving?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.076
Well, I'm a free man.
There's nothing
holding me here now.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.786
What about Jo?

18:11.424 --> 18:12.880
Well, it's not like
we're really together.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.591
And she's not
asking me to stay.

18:16.554 --> 18:17.839
Okay, but I am.

18:18.723 --> 18:19.838
I need your advice.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.347
About?

18:22.184 --> 18:23.390
Women.

18:24.395 --> 18:25.851
Specifically, Holly Marten.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.431
Well, the doctor is in.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.441
She wants to upgrade
our relationship.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.401
And by upgrade,
I mean...

18:34.530 --> 18:35.861
Yeah, I get it.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.196
But...

18:37.575 --> 18:39.440
Just seems like
it's going too fast
for me.

18:39.577 --> 18:40.532
I mean,
where's the whole

18:40.661 --> 18:42.367
getting to know you,
courtship part?

18:42.705 --> 18:44.070
What the hell
is wrong with you?

18:44.540 --> 18:45.825
Have you seen her?

18:48.044 --> 18:49.375
But isn't having
sex too soon

18:49.503 --> 18:50.834
kinda like skipping over
the meat and potatoes

18:50.963 --> 18:52.248
and going straight
to dessert?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.288
There's no such thing
as having sex too soon.

18:54.842 --> 18:55.706
Dessert is the best
main course,

18:55.843 --> 18:57.128
and if you're lucky,
you're gonna get seconds

18:57.261 --> 18:58.546
and thirds,
am I right?

18:58.846 --> 18:59.926
Huh?

19:06.437 --> 19:08.177
HENRY: Methane
concentration is
unusually high,

19:08.356 --> 19:09.687
and I'm getting
readings for...

19:09.815 --> 19:10.975
Yeah, ammonia.
I can smell it.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.439
Yeah, enough
to destabilize

19:12.568 --> 19:13.853
the ground
in this area.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.313
What, are you talking
more sinkholes?

19:15.655 --> 19:16.735
Well, ifthe levels
continue to rise,

19:16.864 --> 19:19.025
you can say good-bye
to the B.C.E.
for starters.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.864
Henry, is there
ammonia on Titan?

19:25.790 --> 19:26.996
In spades.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.873
Well, if we have
little pieces of Tiny

19:30.002 --> 19:31.333
scattered all
over Eureka...

19:31.504 --> 19:33.415
You know what,
I should expand
the search boundaries.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.753
CARTER: Right.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.547
So, you nervous?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.918
Well, the idea
of being sucked into
a giant sinkhole

19:40.054 --> 19:41.385
is not exactly pleasant.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.926
I know, marriage
is a big commitment.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.637
No, you know what?
I'll tell you what.

19:47.853 --> 19:48.968
I wasn't nervous.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.231
What's changed?
Well...

19:51.607 --> 19:53.848
I gave other
Henry's ring
to Grace,

19:53.984 --> 19:55.144
telling her that
I would earn it.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.528
And I thought I had.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.727
Now?
Well, now she wants
a new one.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.856
So I feel like
I still have to
live up to him.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.574
(STUTTERING) Me.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.317
(BEEPING)

20:07.998 --> 20:11.126
High levels of ammonia
and methane in
the 24th quadrant.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.159
Uh, and if
those two mix,

20:13.295 --> 20:14.705
the fog could be
extremely toxic.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.711
All right, what's in
the 24th quadrant?

20:16.841 --> 20:19.708
Uh, off-site lab,
agricultural...

20:19.844 --> 20:21.209
(PAGER BEEPING)
Dr. Leonardo.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.846
All right.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.845
JO: Yeah, no baby's
breathe in her bouquet.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.591
Everyone uses that.
She needs something
special.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.680
Well, how about
lavender? Smell.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.182
Mmm, I love it.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.691
I hate it.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.523
JO: So how
about something
more exotic

20:36.652 --> 20:38.358
like jasmine
or bird of paradise?

20:38.487 --> 20:40.227
Those plants aren't
exactly in season.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.570
The seasons don't
matter in here.

20:41.699 --> 20:42.939
Flip a switch,
make it summer.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.906
What about, um,
Henry's boutonniere?

20:45.035 --> 20:46.866
Roses are generic.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.653
What on Earth?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.490
JO: Is that normal?

20:52.835 --> 20:54.746
No.
And neither is that.

20:58.841 --> 20:59.796
This way.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.506
DR. LEONARDO:
Everybody out!

21:01.635 --> 21:02.590
We've gotta
shut off the vents.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.709
(ALL COUGHING)

21:03.846 --> 21:05.837
The main control valve
is over here.

21:06.932 --> 21:07.921
Okay, go.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.343
Jo, we need
to get outta here!

21:09.477 --> 21:10.557
I'm right behind you.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.404
CARTER: Jo!

21:28.996 --> 21:30.202
HENRY: Grace!

21:34.877 --> 21:36.868
CARTER: What is this stuff?
HENRY: I don't know.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.003
CARTER: Grace! Jo!
(MOANING)

21:40.549 --> 21:41.880
CARTER: You in here?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.291
Carter! Over here!

21:47.973 --> 21:49.474
CARTER: You okay?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.891
You okay?
Yeah.
The ethane fog.

21:53.604 --> 21:54.593
It's coming through
the vents.

21:54.730 --> 21:55.810
JO: Carter!

21:55.940 --> 21:57.020
Shut the valve!

22:03.948 --> 22:04.983
DR. LEONARDO: Careful.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.776
The Tradescantia
as a breed
is delicate.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.069
Are you kidding me?

22:08.285 --> 22:10.276
This thing is trying
to feel me up.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.491
How'd the fog get
into these vents?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.288
Well, whatever
contaminated Eureka

22:14.416 --> 22:15.701
has found its way
through the soil

22:15.835 --> 22:17.746
and then
somehow infiltrated
the venting system.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.163
Is it always
like this in here?

22:19.296 --> 22:21.878
DR. LEONARDO: No,
but I think the plants
saved our lives.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.417
They must've
absorbed the fog.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.630
If there was a nitrate
radical present,

22:26.762 --> 22:29.003
it could've stimulated
a rapid, massive overgrowth.

22:29.849 --> 22:30.884
So...

22:31.183 --> 22:34.801
We're now swamped
by methane, ethane,
ammonia...

22:34.937 --> 22:37.269
And nitrogen, all found
in heavy concentrations...

22:37.481 --> 22:38.891
On Titan.
HENRY: On Titan.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.857
Right.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.902
Holly!

22:45.447 --> 22:47.028
How you doing?
Well...

22:48.325 --> 22:50.065
I am really
looking fonNard
to tonight.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.324
Yeah, me too.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.489
Um, but you know,
if it feels like
we're rushing things,

22:53.622 --> 22:55.874
we could, maybe
just have dinner.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.036
Dinner?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.868
Yeah, you know,
hang out,
shoot the breeze,

23:01.589 --> 23:02.704
share secrets.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.582
Oh, no, let'sjust
stick with the plan
and have sex.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.209
Sounds awesome.
Great, okay.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.719
Well, until tonight...

23:18.898 --> 23:20.604
Ooh. What's wrong?

23:24.194 --> 23:26.606
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.650
Not like this.
Not with you.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.619
Vince, come on,
we haven't even
ordered yet.

23:43.756 --> 23:44.711
VINCENT: Test batch.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.081
I want angel food cake.
Jo insists on hazelnut.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.754
Bold choice
for a wedding cake
if you ask me.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.969
I think you
should decide.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.048
But I'm right.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.480
You're not concerned
about the cake, are you?

24:04.360 --> 24:05.850
No.
Okay.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.856
All right,
talk to me.
What's wrong?

24:10.908 --> 24:11.863
You want new rings.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.108
So... What are you
gonna do with
the old ones?

24:14.453 --> 24:15.989
I mean, you wanna
keep wearing them
around your neck?

24:16.664 --> 24:18.871
I mean, it's like
you're embracing me
with one arm,

24:18.999 --> 24:21.456
but holding onto
somebody else
with the other.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.754
So all three women
are fine and very lucky.

24:30.886 --> 24:31.750
Good.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.593
Prolonged exposure
to the fog is lethal.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.383
And Jo's still
in the infirmary?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.506
She's in
her office.
Wow.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.632
With Warren.

24:39.853 --> 24:40.979
She's the head
of security.
Aw!

24:41.105 --> 24:42.766
He wants her perspective
on our relationship.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.389
Yeah, but Jo's
giving insight about
our relationship?

24:45.526 --> 24:46.515
I mean, she dated
a robot.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.017
Well, we cannot
interfere.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.561
How'd your little talk
with him go?

24:50.906 --> 24:53.067
It's funny,
I didn't realize
how difficult

24:53.200 --> 24:55.031
it was to define
what we are
to each other.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.867
It wasn't,
till he got here.

24:58.831 --> 24:59.946
I think
it's just hard,
you know,

25:00.082 --> 25:02.414
with Henry and Grace
making a real commitment.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.287
(STUTTERING) So you think
a commitment, for...

25:08.424 --> 25:09.880
Okay, don't panic.
No, l...

25:10.009 --> 25:11.715
I didn't say anything
about marriage.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.380
But now that
you brought it up,

25:15.347 --> 25:17.212
is it so inconceivable?

25:19.560 --> 25:20.766
Why, is it for you?

25:20.936 --> 25:22.176
I asked you first.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.811
Hey, Jack,
I'm glad I found you.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.771
Look, I'm sorry,
I gotta show
you something.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.561
Okay, great,
we'll talk about
this later.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.278
Apparently.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.694
Sheriff Carter
and Dr. Blake have
neverengagedin

25:39.496 --> 25:42.488
No. No, they're...
They're always discreet.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.706
Even when Allison
spends the night
at our house...

25:45.878 --> 25:48.119
Well, uh, my house
is under construction.

25:48.297 --> 25:51.881
And Carter was kind
enough to let me stay.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.419
He... He's a very
good friend.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.259
Sheriff Carter
is dating the
head of G.D.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.004
while living
with the head
of G.D. security.

25:59.892 --> 26:03.760
But it's not as
Three's Company
as it sounds.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.511
No, that is
very enlightening.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.141
But, I just...
No, really.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.015
Thank you.
Okay.

26:23.624 --> 26:24.830
(HUMMING WEDDING MARCH)

26:27.211 --> 26:28.747
ZANE: New uniform?
Oh!

26:28.879 --> 26:30.995
No, l was...

26:32.466 --> 26:34.878
I'm just helping Grace
plan her wedding, yeah.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.045
Mmm.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.127
She doesn't seem
to be here.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.963
Yeah, but, uh,
you're still here.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.467
Well, I heard you
had a close call
at the aggie lab.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.890
So do you need anything?

26:47.856 --> 26:49.972
Like a rake?
Or some weed killer?

26:50.109 --> 26:51.940
No, I'm good.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.567
Good.
Yeah.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.272
Yeah, well...

26:55.405 --> 26:56.861
I guess this is
good-bye, then.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.605
Yeah, I...

26:58.742 --> 26:59.857
Again.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.699
I guess so.
Mmm-hmm.

27:01.829 --> 27:02.944
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.489
HENRY: Tiny didn't
absorb anything.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.957
The final tests show
that Tiny's remains

27:09.086 --> 27:10.576
were only coated
with methane.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.748
Meaning?

27:12.881 --> 27:14.746
That the exposure
was terrestrial,

27:14.883 --> 27:16.293
after her return
from Titan.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.138
Well, if
she overdosed
at the B.C.E.,

27:20.264 --> 27:21.470
then where'd
all the methane
come from?

27:21.598 --> 27:22.883
Well, that's
what I don't know.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.552
CARTER: Yeah.
(SIGHING)

27:27.729 --> 27:28.889
What's wrong
with you?

27:29.898 --> 27:30.933
Oh, nothing.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.806
Unless you call
losing the girl
of your dreams

27:32.943 --> 27:34.604
before you ever
even had her wrong.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.060
Ah, very sorry
about that.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.356
Uh, bigger problems
at the moment.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.571
So there were
a mixture of compounds
that created

27:39.867 --> 27:40.777
the ethane fog.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.820
Oh, the guy
at the B.C.E.,

27:42.953 --> 27:44.659
uh, who was whining
about losing Tiny...

27:44.788 --> 27:46.574
He said that he was
planning on creating
that in his lab.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.746
Huggins, Titan
atmosphere specialist.

27:48.876 --> 27:49.865
So type A.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.493
Any tiny mistake,
and he'd flush his
entire simulation

27:52.629 --> 27:53.744
down the proverbial
toilet.

27:53.881 --> 27:57.965
And those simulations
utilized actual
methane, ammonia...

27:58.177 --> 28:00.543
Whoa...
When he dumped it,

28:00.888 --> 28:02.048
where would it go?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.755
To an underground
evacuation chamber.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.675
So it's possible
that the waste from
those simulations

28:08.020 --> 28:10.352
could've permeated
the chamber and
leached into the soil.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.435
Okay, let's go
with that.

28:11.565 --> 28:12.645
How'd it pop up
across town?

28:12.774 --> 28:16.483
There are geothermal
vents that run through

28:16.612 --> 28:18.102
all the layers
of the soil
at both sites

28:18.238 --> 28:20.479
leading from G.D.
to the B.C.E. site

28:20.616 --> 28:22.732
and passing directly
through Main Street.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.366
And it's all
interconnected.

28:24.870 --> 28:25.985
I'll find Huggins.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.111
And I'll get Grace,
and we'll identify
the hot spots.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.532
I'll just sit here.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.250
Alone.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.085
Not having sex.

Don't touch anything.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.378
l have to, Sheriff.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.057
My methane flurries
are too small.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.887
Our Astraeus candidates
need to be prepared
for the real thing.

28:49.019 --> 28:50.304
Wait, stop!

28:50.604 --> 28:52.094
How many times
have you flushed Titan
down the toilet?

28:52.814 --> 28:56.557
Uh, 596. Why?

28:56.777 --> 28:58.813
Listen, you've overloaded
the evacuation chamber.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.732
It's found its way
through the vents
and into the soil.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.365
Now we got sinkholes
and ethane fog

29:02.491 --> 29:03.526
popping up
all over town.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.573
I made ethane fog?

29:06.453 --> 29:08.444
Uh, was it thick?

29:08.705 --> 29:10.491
'Cause, you know,
I never really
got the mix...

29:10.624 --> 29:11.659
Not the point!

29:11.833 --> 29:14.085
Your simulation
is turning Eureka
into Titan.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.808
to get this off
Main Street?
No. l...

30:56.813 --> 30:58.724
Well, I have been
developing a...

30:58.857 --> 31:00.643
A portable
evacuation unit,
but, it, no...

31:00.776 --> 31:02.141
It hasn't been
tested yet.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.352
Dr. Huggins,
maybe the time
is now.

31:05.572 --> 31:08.109
Say no more.
I've trained for
a moment like this.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.274
But I'll need
my partner.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.111
Once Fargo and Holly
pump the fog off
of Main Street,

31:14.247 --> 31:15.657
it's gonna spread
underground.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.247
The whole town
could destabilize.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.957
All right, well,
the vents on
Main Street,

31:19.086 --> 31:21.122
can we redirect them
someplace else?
Yes, but to where?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.755
I'm thinking
Dr. Leonardo's lab.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.746
I mean, her plants
absorbed the fog
and cleaned the air, right?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.623
Sort of like
photosynthesis!

31:26.760 --> 31:28.000
I loved science class.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.963
All right, everybody
move back.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.555
Look!

31:47.823 --> 31:48.938
Who is that?

31:50.450 --> 31:51.530
(SQUEALS)

31:51.660 --> 31:52.900
It's Fargo.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.025
You okay?

31:54.538 --> 31:55.698
Yeah.

31:55.831 --> 31:56.866
We can do this.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.369
Thanks for working
with me, Holly.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.503
It's my job.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.672
From now on,
you and l are
strictly business.

32:11.763 --> 32:12.923

32:18.645 --> 32:20.351

Easy.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.862
Holly, the
methane snow!

32:28.697 --> 32:31.188
Remember,
it's explosive.
Step lightly.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.357
Don't worry about me.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.031
What are they doing?

32:41.334 --> 32:42.835
They're gonna
redirect the fog.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.077
Jack, it's still
confined to Main Street,

32:45.213 --> 32:46.419
but it's spreading
quickly.

32:46.548 --> 32:47.754
Now, if the evac
unit works,

32:47.883 --> 32:49.874
you just have to open
the valve in time.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.926
Or Eureka will become
one giant pit.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.803
Got it.

you doing?

33:30.342 --> 33:31.457

I gotta get out there.

I think so.

must've been damaged.

I'm gonna die
on Titan without
leaving Main Street.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.288
She needs
to go slower.

34:13.843 --> 34:15.549
That's the opposite
of going slower!

34:15.679 --> 34:17.510
Just close
your eyes, Warren,
and breathe.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.383

Save your air, Holly.

I can't recalibrate.

34:24.271 --> 34:25.977

keep slipping.

to switch you to

need space suits?

We got a plan!
