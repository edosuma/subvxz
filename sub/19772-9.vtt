<i>Previously, on</i> Andi Mack...

00:01.717 --> 00:02.681
Hi, Mom.

00:02.709 --> 00:04.128
How long will you be staying?

00:04.182 --> 00:06.846
Okay, so much
for the pleasantries, huh?

00:06.952 --> 00:09.131
I wish you would just
grow up already!

00:09.242 --> 00:10.242
I have.

00:10.506 --> 00:12.763
I'm here, and I'm
raising my daughter.

00:12.892 --> 00:15.702
I live for the day
you tell me you're proud of me.

00:15.836 --> 00:16.879
He's throwing it
and you pass it...

00:16.926 --> 00:18.546
What are you doing here?

00:18.620 --> 00:20.272
You two know each other?

00:20.345 --> 00:22.080
He's my dad.

00:22.607 --> 00:26.062
You invaded my privacy,
and you embarrassed me.

00:26.122 --> 00:27.323
I wanted to surprise you.

00:27.407 --> 00:28.892
Just leave me alone.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.448
What was he doing?

00:32.508 --> 00:34.268
<i>Hey, it's Bowie here.</i>

Good.

01:02.756 --> 01:04.236
I'll finish it.

01:04.584 --> 01:07.186
I just wanna watch this
one more time.

01:07.788 --> 01:10.856
You can watch it "one
more time" as many times

01:10.917 --> 01:16.150
as you want. Which, so
far, has been about... 20?

01:16.264 --> 01:21.060
Well, I miss him.
I miss him a lot.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.814
And now he hates me.

01:24.946 --> 01:26.889
No, he does not.

01:26.924 --> 01:29.776
Then why hasn't
he texted me back?

I know it seems forever,
but it's only been a week.

01:35.032 --> 01:37.174

Okay, work with me here.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.256
Andi's been moping around
since Bowie left.

04:31.423 --> 04:33.042
I finally got her to cheer up.

04:33.149 --> 04:35.235
Can we please focus on that?

04:35.549 --> 04:36.636
Certainly.

04:36.803 --> 04:38.739
Don't say "certainly"

04:38.798 --> 04:41.020
unless you actually
mean "certainly."

04:41.320 --> 04:43.863
Don't be disrespectful
to me, Rebecca.

04:44.016 --> 04:45.637
You are living under my roof.

04:45.751 --> 04:48.974
It's my roof, too, Mom,
in case you forgot.

04:49.046 --> 04:50.948
Before you threw me out,
this was my home.

04:51.014 --> 04:52.776
I did not throw you out.

04:52.824 --> 04:54.744
- I don't wanna fight.
- You brought it up.

04:54.818 --> 04:56.546
I'm sorry I did.

04:56.871 --> 04:59.479
I'm gonna go be with Andi,
make sure she's okay.

05:07.519 --> 05:10.746
Hey! Marty from the party.

05:10.914 --> 05:13.462
Please. My friends call me
Mr. The Party.

05:13.610 --> 05:16.165
Oh, are we friends now?

05:16.273 --> 05:18.911
Well, you're not calling me
eleven-point-five anymore.

05:18.983 --> 05:23.215
Only because it'll be confusing
when that's my name, too.

05:24.168 --> 05:27.276
You know, you get a real sparkle in
your eye when you're overconfident.

05:28.666 --> 05:29.741
I like it.

05:34.193 --> 05:36.661
Ugh. He's so full of himself.

05:36.757 --> 05:39.307
Don't you just wanna
wipe that smirk off his face?

05:39.621 --> 05:41.189
Do you?

05:41.356 --> 05:43.290
What's that supposed to mean?

05:43.426 --> 05:46.721
Nothing. It's just, your
trash talk sounds a lot more

05:46.769 --> 05:48.522
like flirt talk lately.

05:48.873 --> 05:51.038
There's so much electricity
between you and Marty,

05:51.086 --> 05:52.612
my hair's standing on end.

05:52.679 --> 05:56.796
Or, it would be, if it wasn't
such a thick, beautiful mop.

05:56.883 --> 05:58.977
You two don't know
what you're talking about.

05:59.063 --> 06:01.225
Look, it's not a bad thing.

06:01.273 --> 06:06.460
I actually think it's nice you're being
a little... you know, less competitive.

06:13.545 --> 06:14.900
I wanna race.

06:15.467 --> 06:17.129
All right, you got it.

06:17.275 --> 06:19.524
Ready? Set, go!

06:19.584 --> 06:22.787
I mean it. A real race to
prove once and for all

06:22.900 --> 06:24.189
who's the fastest.

06:24.322 --> 06:26.975
Come on, Buffy.
Does it really matter?

06:27.029 --> 06:28.779
Yes. It matters.

06:28.999 --> 06:31.669
Okay, then.
When are you ready to lose?

06:31.874 --> 06:34.739
I'm ready to win
tomorrow after school.

06:34.791 --> 06:36.312
I'll see you
at the finish line...

06:36.360 --> 06:38.289
three-tenths
of a second after me.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.068
Clever, but I don't think so.

06:41.184 --> 06:43.601
You'll be staring
at my back the whole race.

06:43.657 --> 06:46.705
In fact, let me give you
a preview right now.

06:51.284 --> 06:53.050
Did that sound flirty?

06:53.277 --> 06:54.508
No.

06:55.054 --> 06:59.675
I mean, maybe in the way the praying
mantis flirts before eating her mate.

07:00.228 --> 07:02.927
I was in a race once. It's true.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.651
You wanna know how it ended?

07:04.770 --> 07:06.055
You lost?

07:06.103 --> 07:09.658
Obviously. Besides that, I
tripped over the finish line.

07:09.832 --> 07:11.918
It's a painted line, guys.

07:12.269 --> 07:14.060
I don't even know how I did it.

07:16.748 --> 07:19.650
Did Jonah just pretend
not to see me?

07:19.783 --> 07:22.852
Wow, that was
an actual ghosting.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.954
I've never seen one in person.

07:25.481 --> 07:27.272
Ghosting, scary concept.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.502
What does that mean,
that you're dead to him?

07:29.550 --> 07:30.682
No.

07:31.733 --> 07:33.233
Does it?

07:33.633 --> 07:35.684
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

07:35.796 --> 07:38.011
I was behind my chair,
in my thermal pajamas

07:38.098 --> 07:40.026
that I've had since I was eight!

07:40.099 --> 07:42.339
I can't believe
he saw me like that!

07:42.723 --> 07:46.137
Right...
not your finest moment, Andi.

07:46.426 --> 07:48.639
Or your finest pajamas.

08:03.162 --> 08:04.062
Hey!

08:04.131 --> 08:07.749
Look, can I just apologize
for the other day?

08:07.829 --> 08:12.228
I didn't mean to flip out, I was just...
surprised to see you.

08:13.094 --> 08:14.623
So you're not mad at me?

08:14.716 --> 08:16.453
Why would I be mad?

08:16.693 --> 08:17.981
I don't know.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.875
I should've asked you
before I just showed up.

08:19.928 --> 08:21.698
And the whole
Amber text thing...

08:21.779 --> 08:25.426
Totally over that! Heh. Don't
need to talk about it again.

08:25.632 --> 08:27.629
And you can come over anytime.

08:27.723 --> 08:29.278
Come over today if you want.

08:29.358 --> 08:31.366
Okay. Sweet!

08:31.414 --> 08:32.458
Really?

08:32.544 --> 08:34.535
Yeah. Why not?

08:36.797 --> 08:40.496
Uh, wait. I can't. There's
something I have to do.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.865
Oh. Okay.

08:42.919 --> 08:46.756
But if you still wanna hang out,
I actually could use some help.

08:46.992 --> 08:49.716
I'm up for anything.
Just name it and I'll be there.

08:49.811 --> 08:51.951
I have to get Amber
a birthday present.

08:54.658 --> 08:55.806
Sweet.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.448
Andi! Jonah!

09:06.674 --> 09:08.747
Look at you guys, here!

09:08.820 --> 09:10.485
Together.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.330
We're getting a birthday present
for Amber.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.136
You remember her, right, Bex?

09:15.184 --> 09:18.748
Jonah's girlfriend
who's still his... girlfriend.

09:18.895 --> 09:20.182
Yes, I do.

09:20.655 --> 09:22.333
What a sweetheart.

09:22.956 --> 09:25.101
So, Jonah, uh,
what were you thinkin'?

09:25.367 --> 09:26.521
I don't know!

09:26.699 --> 09:28.452
Amber never likes
what I give her,

09:28.507 --> 09:30.914
and... she won't tell me
what she wants.

09:30.962 --> 09:33.755
It's like this fun guessing game
that we play that I never win.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.568
It... It isn't really fun.

09:35.881 --> 09:38.249
Like I said, what a sweetheart.

09:39.103 --> 09:40.288
How about makeup?

09:40.495 --> 09:41.649
She'd love that!

09:41.685 --> 09:43.209
I... I think.

09:43.244 --> 09:44.953
I wouldn't know what to get.

09:44.989 --> 09:46.867
Don't worry,
I'll show you everything...

09:47.134 --> 09:48.202
on Andi!

09:48.762 --> 09:50.057
On Andi?

09:50.457 --> 09:52.680
Why on Andi?

09:53.913 --> 09:55.593
Come on, this way.
This is gonna be so fun!

09:55.673 --> 09:58.230
This is foundation.

09:58.278 --> 10:02.185
It helps minimize pores, just in
case Amber's are a little big.

10:03.095 --> 10:05.904
I mean, we can't all have
great skin like this.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.617
This highlights
Andi's cheekbones.

10:11.751 --> 10:13.799
Does Amber have cheekbones?
I can't remember.

I don't understand.
It was right here in my gym bag!

10:51.844 --> 10:53.832
Okay, deep breath.
Retrace your steps.

10:53.892 --> 10:55.459
Did you have your bag
with me all day?

10:55.526 --> 10:58.073
Yes! It hasn't been
out of my sight!

10:59.173 --> 11:02.490
Except for when I left it in Spanish
and later in the cafeteria.

11:03.847 --> 11:05.147

11:05.240 --> 11:06.702
I'm so relieved.

11:06.855 --> 11:08.936
Marty! Marty took it.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.152
Suddenly, not so relieved.

11:11.228 --> 11:14.822
He wants to sabotage me because he's
afraid I'm going to win tomorrow.

11:15.014 --> 11:17.643
And you know what they say:
If the shoe fits,

11:17.691 --> 11:21.175
someone's going to steal it so
you can't wear it and beat him.

11:21.908 --> 11:23.743

And two...
Please, please, please,

11:26.538 --> 11:28.698
just promise me you won't
do anything stupid.

11:28.747 --> 11:32.635
Fine. I promise I won't
do anything stupid.

11:34.491 --> 11:36.415
I wanna believe you, but
that wild look in your eyes

11:36.462 --> 11:37.864
is making it difficult.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.460
And the fact that you didn't
respond to that last statement.

11:46.283 --> 11:47.616
Jonah Beck said I looked pretty.

11:47.737 --> 11:49.555
Can you believe it?

11:49.935 --> 11:52.015
Of course I can believe it.
You're amazing.

11:52.068 --> 11:54.090
No, you're amazing.

11:54.197 --> 11:56.358
How'd you come up
with that makeover idea?

11:56.538 --> 11:58.225
I know a little something
about boys.

11:58.405 --> 12:02.276
And, that one likes you,
even if he doesn't know it yet.

12:02.383 --> 12:03.871
You don't know that!

12:03.985 --> 12:05.031
You'll see.

12:05.079 --> 12:07.068
Someday you'll look back
on this basket of baby taters

12:07.115 --> 12:09.129
and realize how smart I am.

12:10.453 --> 12:12.416
Why did you have to leave?

12:13.786 --> 12:14.879
What?

12:14.945 --> 12:16.293
When I was a baby.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.774
It's just, this is so much fun.

12:18.867 --> 12:21.660
Boy talk, thrift shopping,
baby taters...

12:21.813 --> 12:23.808
we could've always
been doing this.

12:24.101 --> 12:25.968
You could've always been here.

12:27.678 --> 12:30.584
Okay. You wanna do this now?

12:30.990 --> 12:32.125
Let's do it.

12:32.432 --> 12:34.640
I won't dodge any more
of your questions.

12:35.447 --> 12:38.215
Oh. I wasn't
expecting an answer.

12:38.488 --> 12:40.600
I just wanna sit here
and listen to you tell me

12:40.648 --> 12:42.519
how Jonah Beck
secretly likes me.

12:44.041 --> 12:46.513
Well, we might need
milk shakes for that.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.035
Waiter!

12:55.195 --> 12:57.458
- You're late for dinner.
- I know, I'm sorry.

12:57.512 --> 12:59.131
We already ate.

13:02.075 --> 13:03.667
Are you wearing makeup?

13:03.884 --> 13:06.628
- Not that much.
- Relax. It all comes off

13:06.676 --> 13:07.914
with a little soap and water.

13:07.963 --> 13:10.252
No Andis were harmed
in this makeover.

13:14.479 --> 13:17.243
I seem to remember
that when you first got here,

13:17.291 --> 13:19.957
you said you'd only be staying
for a short time.

13:20.653 --> 13:22.397
What are you saying?

13:23.774 --> 13:25.974
She's saying she wants me
to move out.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.944
Cece, no. Please, don't.

13:30.077 --> 13:34.185
Bex coming back is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

13:34.550 --> 13:36.078
Please!

13:36.992 --> 13:39.074
Don't make her leave again.

13:39.707 --> 13:41.609
Again? What did you tell her?

13:41.709 --> 13:43.501
Nothing, I swear.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.314
Andi, it was your welfare
I was thinking about.

13:46.362 --> 13:47.692
It... It really was for the best.

13:47.740 --> 13:50.307
Mom! Stop talking,
I didn't tell her anything!

13:50.604 --> 13:52.206
What didn't you tell me?

13:54.342 --> 13:56.349
And what was for the best?

13:58.762 --> 14:00.083
Oh.

14:00.581 --> 14:02.010
I get it.

14:02.858 --> 14:05.144
You didn't leave
when I was born.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.533
You...

14:11.029 --> 14:13.038
sent her away.

14:13.073 --> 14:14.073
No.

14:15.225 --> 14:17.709
I... uh...

14:24.351 --> 14:25.529
I tried talking
to her last night.

14:25.576 --> 14:27.696
She just wanted
to be left alone.

14:27.856 --> 14:30.148
I don't want her to think
I sent you away.

14:30.377 --> 14:32.402
Well, I know that's not
what you think.

14:32.450 --> 14:34.844
Because that's
not what happened.

14:35.014 --> 14:38.053
Mom, we've been having
this fight for 13 years.

14:38.101 --> 14:41.013
I've resigned myself to the fact that
we'll never agree what happened.

14:41.107 --> 14:43.017
But now Andi needs to know.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.838
Well, we're not
telling her your story.

14:46.020 --> 14:47.880
Well, I certainly don't
want her to hear yours.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.328
Well, we gotta
figure something out.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.150
We can't just leave her
stuck in his limbo.

14:51.275 --> 14:54.639
I know. I can't imagine
how this is affecting her.

15:00.601 --> 15:01.828
What?

15:03.459 --> 15:04.656
Nothing.

15:11.973 --> 15:14.206
Have a good day.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.001
It's happening.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.871
My worst nightmare is happening.

15:19.479 --> 15:20.785
What's happening?

15:21.117 --> 15:22.399
She's turning into you.

15:22.499 --> 15:24.429
And I can't watch.

15:36.856 --> 15:40.051
Why would you wear all that stuff
if you were just gonna take it off?

15:40.099 --> 15:41.664
I was making a point.

15:41.744 --> 15:44.345
- Which was?
- That if Cece's gonna make decisions

15:44.412 --> 15:46.111
without consulting me,

15:46.218 --> 15:48.313
there are going
to be consequences.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.918
Oh, that's good. Because adults are
always telling us about consequences.

15:53.105 --> 15:55.440
And Cece deserves it.

15:55.762 --> 15:58.095
She sent Bex away
without even asking me.

15:58.556 --> 16:01.104
You were... a baby.

16:01.195 --> 16:03.797
That's true, but it doesn't
change how I feel.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.485
And feelings aren't always
rational, okay?

16:06.578 --> 16:07.665
Mine are.

16:13.768 --> 16:15.820
- You coming?
- Yeah, just give me a second.

16:16.537 --> 16:18.197
What are you doing?

16:21.488 --> 16:23.815
I'm making a point, too.

16:23.887 --> 16:26.763
An incredibly disgusting one.

16:36.572 --> 16:38.206
Yo, Andi!

16:38.645 --> 16:39.872
Thanks again for yesterday.

16:39.979 --> 16:40.860
That was fun.

16:40.935 --> 16:42.449
Sure, anytime.

16:42.575 --> 16:44.122
I'm really glad you said that.

16:44.652 --> 16:46.551
Amber loved the makeup!

16:47.050 --> 16:49.237
But she hated my card.

16:53.822 --> 16:55.477
"Happy Birthday. From Jonah."

16:55.777 --> 16:57.485
It gets the job done.

16:57.588 --> 16:59.969
She said she wanted
more emotion-y stuff.

17:01.351 --> 17:03.177
She gave it back
so I can try it again.

17:03.294 --> 17:06.672
Amber's really good
at giving me second chances.

17:06.736 --> 17:10.858
Yeah, that's, um, one of
her many good qualities.

17:11.727 --> 17:14.481
So, could you
tell me what to write?

17:15.893 --> 17:17.862
Just write what you feel.

17:18.983 --> 17:21.192
I don't know how to do that.

17:21.516 --> 17:23.964
I just need something really nice
that sounds like I wrote it.

17:25.661 --> 17:27.223
Could you help me?

17:28.077 --> 17:29.093
Please?

17:30.202 --> 17:32.208
Sure. Sure.

17:32.630 --> 17:36.334
I have class right now,
but, um... maybe later.

17:36.420 --> 17:38.520
Awesome. Thanks, Andi.

17:38.593 --> 17:41.665
You're a great... pal.

17:55.609 --> 17:56.959
What are you smiling about?

17:57.007 --> 17:58.546
This.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.098
Ugh. Your sneakers
are dripping on my sneakers.

18:01.406 --> 18:03.785
They're not my sneakers.

18:04.178 --> 18:07.220
Oh, no, you have that wild look
in your eyes again.

18:07.757 --> 18:09.092
Please tell me they're not...

18:09.179 --> 18:10.041
My sneakers!

18:10.076 --> 18:11.718
Of course.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.857
Why do you have them?

18:13.929 --> 18:16.363
And why are they wet?

18:16.545 --> 18:20.647
You stole my shoe yesterday,
so, I stole yours.

18:21.153 --> 18:23.566
And they may have gone for a
little swim in the girls' room.

18:23.652 --> 18:25.698
I didn't take your shoe!

18:25.878 --> 18:27.490
Oh, really? Then who did?

18:27.664 --> 18:28.944
No one.

18:30.349 --> 18:32.187
It was in my mom's car.

18:32.329 --> 18:35.284
Must've fallen out when we gave
you a ride home the other day.

18:38.610 --> 18:41.379
Wanna skip to the part
where we're laughing about this?

18:41.453 --> 18:42.626
No.

18:43.279 --> 18:44.645
Is there something
you wanna say to me?

18:44.692 --> 18:45.943
I'll replace these.

18:46.498 --> 18:52.763
Yeah, you will. But those weren't
the words I was looking for.

18:55.562 --> 18:57.175
What's his problem?

18:57.249 --> 19:01.001
Just a guess? I think he
wanted you to say "I'm sorry."

19:01.393 --> 19:02.806
Why didn't he just say so?

19:02.923 --> 19:06.012
Maybe he wanted you to come
up with the idea on your own?

19:06.198 --> 19:09.127
I can't be trusted to come
up with ideas on my own!

19:10.087 --> 19:11.504
Exhibit A.

19:27.859 --> 19:29.978
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:30.165 --> 19:31.517
What happened to your new look?

19:31.578 --> 19:33.031
Was Cece freaked out?

19:33.098 --> 19:34.180
Oh, yeah.

19:34.286 --> 19:36.215
Then it served its purpose.

19:38.181 --> 19:40.061
Are you looking for someone?

19:40.219 --> 19:41.233
Nope.

19:41.299 --> 19:42.545
Let's get out of here.

19:42.593 --> 19:44.651
But I... don't wanna go home.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.038
Me neither.

19:46.122 --> 19:47.871
Great, so where are we going?

19:47.966 --> 19:49.750
Home.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.865
But I just said...

19:56.707 --> 19:58.894
I thought you said
we were going home.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.313
We are.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.347
This is where we live now.

20:05.047 --> 20:06.136
What?

20:06.184 --> 20:08.182
Welcome home.

20:15.936 --> 20:17.102
<i>Next, on</i> Andi Mack...

20:17.196 --> 20:18.817
What's going on with your pants?

20:18.897 --> 20:20.251
<i>Bex did the laundry.</i>

20:20.299 --> 20:22.019
It smells like kiwi.

20:22.105 --> 20:23.465
<i>It's like this adventure...</i>

20:23.525 --> 20:25.140
Did we blow another fuse?

20:25.194 --> 20:27.508
That I didn't know
I was going on.

20:27.642 --> 20:30.008
<i>We haven't spoken
to Cece since we left.</i>

20:30.081 --> 20:31.460
It's not like
we're still fighting.

20:31.508 --> 20:32.712
I think you should call them.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.068
I think she should call me.

20:34.103 --> 20:35.848
<i>Now it's more
a game of chicken.</i>

20:35.968 --> 20:38.350
Can't you guys just move back?

20:39.757 --> 20:41.471
I don't think that's an option.

20:41.551 --> 20:42.850
Hey-hey!
