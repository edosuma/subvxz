WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:03.223
So I told Nikolaj, "Who cares
if you're bad at skateboarding?

00:03.224 --> 00:05.693
When you grow up, nobody thinks
skateboarders are cool."

00:05.708 --> 00:07.647
What's cool is
having your own pants.

00:07.648 --> 00:09.648
- Uh-huh. Sure.
- Jake, you seem distracted.

00:09.650 --> 00:11.617
You're agreeing
with everything I say.

00:13.098 --> 00:14.980
We should go on a month-long
couples' vacation:

00:14.981 --> 00:17.144
- You, Amy, me, and my dad.
- Yeah, yeah, fine, whatever.

00:17.145 --> 00:18.349
And we should get
matching hats that say,

00:18.350 --> 00:20.455
"Best Bud 1" and "Best Bud 2."
And wear them all the time!

00:20.456 --> 00:22.017
For sure. Look, Charles,
don't look behind you,

00:22.018 --> 00:23.038
but I think
we're being followed.

00:23.069 --> 00:24.810
I saw this guy when we were
leaving the precinct,

00:24.811 --> 00:26.835
and he was in line at lunch,
and now he's right behind us.

00:26.836 --> 00:27.635
Is it someone you arrested?

00:27.896 --> 00:29.220
I don't recognize him,
but judging by the

00:29.221 --> 00:31.297
head-to-toe denim, I say
he's either not American

00:31.298 --> 00:32.060
or deeply American.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.976
- I'm thinking Ukraine or Kentucky.
- Well, should we call it in?

00:34.978 --> 00:37.612
No. I've got a better idea.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.494 --> 00:47.426
Hi there.

00:47.428 --> 00:49.362
Who are you, and why are you
following me?

00:49.364 --> 00:50.963
I'm not following you.

00:50.965 --> 00:53.966
I come for Charles Boyle.
Hey, hey, hey!

00:53.968 --> 00:55.601
- Hands where we can see them.
- Chill out, bro!

00:55.603 --> 00:58.371
It's not gun.
It's just... uh, it's a toy.

00:58.373 --> 00:59.705
No shoot, pretty please.

00:59.707 --> 01:01.574
It's gift for Nikolaj.

01:01.576 --> 01:03.643
Nikolaj?
How do you know Charles' son?

01:03.645 --> 01:04.843
My name is Gintars.

01:04.846 --> 01:06.612
From Latvia.

01:06.614 --> 01:08.247
I am Nikolaj birth father.

01:08.249 --> 01:12.318
Ohh! Nikolaj's birth father
who I'd never hope to meet.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.853
Very cool.

01:13.855 --> 01:15.855
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool,

01:15.857 --> 01:18.624
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, c-c-c-c-c...

01:38.913 --> 01:40.947
Charles, are you okay?
You hit your head pretty hard.

01:40.949 --> 01:42.944
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I don't have a concussion.

01:42.946 --> 01:44.146
We'll see about that.

01:44.148 --> 01:45.947
How many musical numbers are
there in the movie "Zootopia"?

01:45.949 --> 01:47.916
- Oh, just the one.
- Yeah, he's okay.

01:47.918 --> 01:49.384
I don't know what's going on.

01:49.386 --> 01:50.739
How did you find me?

01:50.740 --> 01:52.380
The orphanage isn't supposed to
give out that information.

01:52.381 --> 01:54.526
You know Dragomir,
Nikolaj brother?

01:55.154 --> 01:56.286
He tell me all about you.

01:56.329 --> 01:58.324
Of course.
You're Dragomir's father too.

01:58.325 --> 01:59.891
No, Dragomir is my brother.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.538
Dragomir and I have same father
but different mother.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.554
Her name Anyuta.

02:03.555 --> 02:05.539
Together we have baby.
That baby's Nikolaj.

02:05.540 --> 02:06.945
Dragomir is brother of Nikolaj.

02:06.946 --> 02:09.320
I am brother of Dragomir.
Also stepfather.

02:09.321 --> 02:10.990
We are
contemporary blended family.

02:10.995 --> 02:13.028
Would make very good TV show.

02:13.048 --> 02:14.940
Honestly, that does sound
very interesting and good.

02:14.946 --> 02:17.230
Anyways, I was too young and
poor to have child,

02:17.231 --> 02:20.451
but now I'm very successful
businessman.

02:20.452 --> 02:23.310
I have my own clothing line.
Maybe you've heard of it:

02:23.311 --> 02:24.010
The Gape.

02:24.046 --> 02:25.972
We also have Baby Gape
and the Gape Body.

02:25.991 --> 02:27.819
- Oh, you mean The Gap?
- No, no, Gape.

02:27.820 --> 02:31.382
Like, there are two things
and there's space between.

02:31.383 --> 02:32.482
Yeah, like, The Gap.
Like, The Gap.

02:32.484 --> 02:34.117
The company that already exists.

02:34.118 --> 02:36.353
I don't know what you're saying.
I never heard of it.

02:36.419 --> 02:39.260
But is it a knock-off of Gape?
Do they sell clothing?

02:39.262 --> 02:41.980
So what? You have money now, and
you're just gonna take Nikolaj back?

02:41.981 --> 02:44.057
No, no, I don't want to take
boy from you.

02:44.058 --> 02:45.660
I just want to meet him one time.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.186
Look, I know it's lot to ask,

02:47.187 --> 02:50.067
but, please.
Nikolaj is my sex result.

02:50.068 --> 02:52.969
Oh, yeah? Well, I walk your sex
result to school every morning.

02:52.971 --> 02:53.976
No, don't use his words.

02:53.977 --> 02:55.699
I help your sex result with
his homework.

02:55.700 --> 02:56.540
This is bad, even for you.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.745
I sing your sex result a
lullaby every night.

02:58.747 --> 03:01.186
- I wanna do something.
- You will never meet my son.

03:01.187 --> 03:02.930
Oh, yeah? Well, then I don't
leave America until

03:02.931 --> 03:05.322
I meet the boy.
And I come from white country.

03:05.324 --> 03:07.124
I have very long visa.

03:07.126 --> 03:09.093
Very long.

03:09.095 --> 03:11.969
So I'm positive the murder
happened inside this apartment,

03:11.971 --> 03:13.770
but CSI could find
no traces of blood.

03:13.771 --> 03:15.880
I'd like to ask the FBI to
bring in a team of lab techs.

03:15.881 --> 03:17.580
This would require
Commissioner Kelly signing off.

03:17.582 --> 03:20.250
Before I make that ask, is
there anything else we can do?

03:20.252 --> 03:22.719
Um, I'm pretty sure there is.

03:22.721 --> 03:24.220
Are you thinking what I'm
thinking?

03:24.222 --> 03:25.288
I am now.

03:25.290 --> 03:26.880
We need Yee!

03:26.884 --> 03:27.394
Who?

03:27.395 --> 03:29.095
Isn't it that guy that led
that seminar where you guys

03:29.097 --> 03:30.516
turned Boyle into a mummy,

03:30.517 --> 03:31.664
and then you pushed him down
the stairs?

03:31.668 --> 03:32.834
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Rosa.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.730
Easy. No one pushed Boyle down
the stairs.

03:35.731 --> 03:37.130
Right. We may have
plastered his eyes shut

03:37.132 --> 03:38.465
and left him
to wander around blindly,

03:38.467 --> 03:40.867
but he fell down on his own.

03:40.869 --> 03:42.235
- It was a classic accident.
- Exactly.

03:42.237 --> 03:44.237
Anyway, Dr. Yee is a genius

03:44.239 --> 03:45.972
in the field of forensic
entomology.

03:45.974 --> 03:49.242
They call him "Father Fly."

03:49.244 --> 03:50.977
- How cool is that?
- 0%.

03:50.979 --> 03:52.545
How are insects gonna help us?

03:52.547 --> 03:53.847
There weren't any in or around
the body.

03:53.849 --> 03:54.948
Oh, my God.

03:54.950 --> 03:58.551
You still think forensic
entomology is all blow flies

03:58.553 --> 04:00.754
and screw worms, don't you?

04:14.736 --> 04:16.403
That's a good one, Santiago.

04:16.404 --> 04:17.536
You should take the
Lieutenant's exam.

04:17.539 --> 04:18.005
Hey.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.207
Dr. Yee has recently
bred a species of fly

04:21.209 --> 04:23.310
that has increased sensitivities
to certain human proteins.

04:23.312 --> 04:25.745
They can detect trace amounts
of blood,

04:25.747 --> 04:27.414
even if it's been cleaned
with bleach.

04:27.416 --> 04:30.283
- Or masked with animal urine.
- Oh, I was building to that.

04:30.285 --> 04:32.519
- Thanks for stealing my thunder.
- This is nasty.

04:32.521 --> 04:34.654
Terry hates bugs.
Too many eyes and legs.

04:34.656 --> 04:36.256
Would you still hate bugs
if I told you that

04:36.258 --> 04:38.391
there were thousands of tiny
mites that live

04:38.393 --> 04:40.493
in your eyebrows and keep them
from being weighed down

04:40.495 --> 04:42.729
- by oils?
- Yes!

04:42.731 --> 04:44.985
Look, I really think we should
go with the feds on this.

04:44.986 --> 04:47.420
No, we're bringing in Yee.
I'll make the call right now.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.838
- Oh, can I listen on speaker?
- Mm.

04:48.839 --> 04:50.772
Oh, my God.
It's gonna be a long couple of days.

04:50.775 --> 04:53.335
You're telling me.
I got bugs in my brows, Rosa.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.868
Hey.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.804
So what's your plan
with Gintars?

04:56.806 --> 04:58.205
He's kind of taking over
the whole waiting area.

04:58.207 --> 04:59.173
No, don't worry about me.

04:59.175 --> 05:01.642
I'm watching "Mad About You"
on Latvian Hulu.

05:01.644 --> 05:02.977
It's very funny show.

05:02.979 --> 05:04.378
Very many episodes.

05:04.380 --> 05:06.880
I could sit here all day.

05:06.882 --> 05:08.115
I don't know what to do.

05:08.117 --> 05:09.250
He's never gonna leave.

05:09.252 --> 05:10.935
But I'm scared for Nikolaj
to get to know him.

05:10.940 --> 05:11.574
Okay, how about this?

05:11.575 --> 05:13.187
Gintars just wants
to see him, right?

05:13.188 --> 05:14.152
We can maybe have them meet

05:14.153 --> 05:16.423
without telling Nikolaj that
Gintars is his birth father.

05:16.425 --> 05:17.690
Just say he's an old friend
of ours.

05:17.883 --> 05:20.403
Jake, you're completely forgetting
about the olfactory bond.

05:20.404 --> 05:23.036
Nikolaj will immediately
recognize his father's scent.

05:23.037 --> 05:24.036
Well, you got to do something,

05:24.038 --> 05:25.838
and I don't think you're gonna
wait this guy out.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.630
Paul and Jamie
are locked in the bathroom.

05:28.631 --> 05:30.530
But Jamie has a turkey
in the oven.

05:31.061 --> 05:32.227
This is a very good setup.

05:32.229 --> 05:33.962
- And they pay it off.
- It's so good.

05:33.964 --> 05:37.032
Okay, Jake,
let's give your plan a shot.

05:37.034 --> 05:40.635
Okay, Gintars, remember the deal is,
you cannot tell Nikolaj you're his father.

05:40.637 --> 05:42.637
Who Gintars?
I'm Billy Hanukkah.

05:42.639 --> 05:46.441
I'm from the Bronx, Manhattan.
I eat pizza at Famous Ray's.

05:46.443 --> 05:48.954
Okay, well, no need to get too
specific or offer up any backstory.

05:48.956 --> 05:51.423
Hey, guys. I'm just coming from
work with my friend Billy Hanukkah.

05:51.425 --> 05:53.008
- Hanukkah.
- It's fine.

05:53.010 --> 05:54.115
Kids don't know
which names are weird.

05:54.116 --> 05:56.460
Nikolaj, say hi to Jake
and this stranger.

05:56.461 --> 05:59.002
Hi, Jake. I love you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hanukkah.

05:59.003 --> 05:59.917
I love you too.

05:59.918 --> 06:01.259
Man, he really is a Boyle,
isn't he?

06:01.260 --> 06:03.427
Hello, my little friend.
Did you have good day at school?

06:03.502 --> 06:05.809
- We had computer class today.
- I am your real father!

06:05.810 --> 06:07.176
My name is Gintars.

06:07.178 --> 06:08.444
- You are my son.
- What?

06:08.446 --> 06:10.813
Well.
That backfired real quick.

06:12.691 --> 06:15.559
Daddy, why is the man saying
he's my father?

06:15.645 --> 06:17.845
Mr. Hanukkah is crazy,
he has no children of his own,

06:17.847 --> 06:19.780
and it's driven him mad.

06:19.782 --> 06:20.981
I'm your father, Nikolaj.

06:20.983 --> 06:22.183
- It's pronounced Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

06:22.185 --> 06:23.184
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

06:23.186 --> 06:24.185
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

06:24.187 --> 06:25.186
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

06:25.188 --> 06:26.213
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

06:26.214 --> 06:27.411
It's okay. You say it wrong.

06:27.412 --> 06:28.944
Okay, well, that was fun.

06:28.945 --> 06:31.468
Hey, why don't you go play over
there, buddy?

06:31.470 --> 06:34.137
You can take this
drug store receipt.

06:34.139 --> 06:35.605
It's very long and filled
with coupons.

06:35.607 --> 06:36.806
You can fly it around
like a kite.

06:36.822 --> 06:38.836
Whee!

06:38.837 --> 06:41.187
Wow, kids are really basic.
Is being a dad super easy?

06:41.197 --> 06:42.287
What the hell was that?

06:42.288 --> 06:43.631
You promised you
wouldn't tell him.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.005
I'm so sorry. I smelled my boy.
I don't know what came over me.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.884
Please. I'm in town
for 10 more days.

06:47.888 --> 06:50.793
Let Nikolaj know I exist.
Let me spend time with him.

06:50.799 --> 06:52.373
I could take him
to Russian bathhouse.

06:52.378 --> 06:53.415
- Has he been?
- No!

06:53.416 --> 06:56.340
I'm not some weirdo that takes my
eight-year-old to the Russian bath!

06:56.341 --> 07:00.905
We take our baths at home together
as a family like normal people!

07:00.906 --> 07:03.606
Not sure you have the upper
hand on that storm-off, Boyle.

07:04.587 --> 07:06.753
He's here!
Dr. Yee's on his way up.

07:06.754 --> 07:08.421
How's my breath?

07:08.423 --> 07:09.940
Perfect.
Yee's gonna love it.

07:09.948 --> 07:10.947
This is not a good color on
you guys.

07:10.949 --> 07:11.981
Speaking of bad looks,

07:11.983 --> 07:14.580
Sarge, what is going on
with your eyebrows, man?

07:14.584 --> 07:17.451
I shaved them off.
'Cause of the bugs.

07:17.453 --> 07:18.458
Sharon said you couldn't notice.

07:18.466 --> 07:20.259
Sharon lied, Terry. You look
like a straight-up fool.

07:20.260 --> 07:21.030
Damn, Rosa.

07:21.031 --> 07:24.032
No, Diaz is right.
Your face is horrifying.

07:24.034 --> 07:27.420
You should leave before...
Hello, Dr. Yee!

07:27.424 --> 07:31.015
- Out back now.
- Captain Holt, nice to see you again.

07:31.016 --> 07:31.940
Please, call me Raymond.

07:31.957 --> 07:34.150
Unless that feels weird.
You don't have to.

07:34.155 --> 07:35.154
I'll answer to anything.

07:35.156 --> 07:36.856
Raymond works.

07:36.858 --> 07:38.991
So I understand you have a
potential crime scene,

07:38.993 --> 07:40.330
and you'd like to find some blood.

07:40.331 --> 07:44.899
Well, I've brought along several hundred
of my best detectives to help out.

07:44.981 --> 07:49.017
- Oh, my God. I'm starstruck.
- We all are.

07:49.019 --> 07:50.390
So what you made you think of
using drosophila

07:50.391 --> 07:51.752
as a method of searching for
blood traces?

07:51.753 --> 07:53.380
Have you ever read Sung
Ts'u's textbook

07:53.381 --> 07:55.365
"The Washing Away of Wrongs"
from 1235?

07:55.366 --> 07:55.931
- Nope.
- Yes.

07:55.967 --> 07:56.430
Which edition?

07:56.431 --> 07:59.599
It tells the story of the first
known use of forensic entomology.

07:59.606 --> 08:01.039
A farmer was slashed to death.

08:01.123 --> 08:03.856
A local judge asked everyone in
the town to lay down their sickles.

08:03.866 --> 08:07.380
And though they all appeared clean,
one attracted a horde of flies.

08:07.386 --> 08:11.088
The insects could sense the blood, even
though it was invisible to the human eye.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.724
- Wow, what an arresting story.
- Yes, they did arrest him.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.262
We made a joke together.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.734
Okay, Dr. Yee, how effective
is your box of bugs?

08:23.736 --> 08:24.902
Oh, well, in a lab,

08:24.904 --> 08:26.236
they've detected blood even

08:26.238 --> 08:27.571
when it's been cleaned
with bleach.

08:27.627 --> 08:30.461
- Or covered with animal urine!
- You two really know your stuff.

08:36.485 --> 08:37.885
I know that sound.

08:37.962 --> 08:40.368
That's the moaning of a man
who left his lunch on the bus.

08:40.370 --> 08:43.496
I didn't lose my lunch, you idiot.
I lost my son!

08:43.498 --> 08:45.264
Okay, Scully, I got this.

08:45.266 --> 08:47.066
Hey there, bud.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.401
I got you your favorite tea:

08:48.403 --> 08:50.269
- Duck broth.
- Thanks.

08:50.271 --> 08:52.004
You know me so well.

08:52.006 --> 08:53.573
But I'm too sad
to drink duck broth.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.609
Wow, I never thought I'd hear
you or anyone say that.

08:56.611 --> 08:59.512
Nikolaj is asking if Gintars
is really his dad.

08:59.514 --> 09:02.448
I worked so hard to have him
think of me as his father.

09:02.450 --> 09:03.716
And now it's all ruined.

09:03.732 --> 09:05.512
He'll probably go back to
calling me what he did

09:05.513 --> 09:07.759
when I first adopted him:
Mr. America.

09:07.761 --> 09:09.698
I know you're upset,
but that is a dope nickname.

09:09.730 --> 09:12.530
- I'm not Mr. America. I'm Daddy.
- Of course you are.

09:12.580 --> 09:15.435
I just don't want
Nikolaj to see him again.

09:15.436 --> 09:17.436
I don't want him turning
into a Gintars.

09:17.438 --> 09:18.203
You have nothing to worry about.

09:18.205 --> 09:20.572
Nikolaj is already
a mini Charles.

09:20.574 --> 09:22.040
He's an eight-year-old boy
whose favorite movie

09:22.042 --> 09:23.273
is "Bullets Over Broadway."

09:23.274 --> 09:25.904
So what are you saying? I should
let him spend time with Gintars?

09:26.011 --> 09:28.651
I just worry that if you prevent
him from knowing his birth father,

09:28.664 --> 09:31.583
that he'll build up some fantasy of him
and then blame you for keeping them apart.

09:31.586 --> 09:32.318
That's crazy.

09:32.358 --> 09:35.006
The way that King Trident kept
Ariel from exploring the surface.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.055
Oh, my God, you're right.

09:36.056 --> 09:38.422
I'm driving Nikolaj into the
arms of a sea witch.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.815
- Watching him work is amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

09:41.816 --> 09:44.364
- I have to get a video.
- Santiago, please.

09:44.368 --> 09:47.869
Hold the phone horizontal
to get more flies in frame.

09:47.884 --> 09:50.385
All right, guys, this fanboy
stuff is a little much.

09:50.387 --> 09:52.153
The only thing that's a
little much over here

09:52.155 --> 09:54.355
are your scrawled-on eyebrows.

09:54.357 --> 09:55.557
- Yeesh.
- Seriously?

09:55.559 --> 09:57.091
- I thought they worked.
- They do...

09:57.093 --> 09:58.415
if you wanna look
like a mean drag queen.

09:58.416 --> 10:00.482
I knew I should have done
a flatter arch.

10:00.484 --> 10:01.717
This is a nighttime look.

10:01.719 --> 10:04.219
Well, the flies
are not reacting.

10:04.221 --> 10:05.788
I can keep going,
but I'll tell you now,

10:05.790 --> 10:08.314
it's very unlikely there are
any traces of blood in here.

10:08.315 --> 10:09.624
Well, according to my timeline,

10:09.625 --> 10:11.392
this is the only place the
murder could have happened.

10:11.392 --> 10:13.425
Sorry, Rosa, looks like
your timeline's wrong.

10:13.453 --> 10:15.619
Because the flies don't lie.

10:15.683 --> 10:16.949
You can use that if you want.

10:16.951 --> 10:19.819
He's not gonna use a cheeky slogan.
He's a man of science.

10:19.821 --> 10:22.588
I like it.
The flies don't lie.

10:22.590 --> 10:25.658
Okay, Dr. Yee, exactly how
accurate is this technology?

10:25.660 --> 10:27.860
Diaz, how dare you
question the man.

10:27.862 --> 10:30.290
Dr. Yee has spent millions
of dollars developing

10:30.291 --> 10:31.964
and researching these flies.

10:31.971 --> 10:34.172
It's fine. Would you all like
to see what happens

10:34.174 --> 10:35.983
when they actually sense blood?

10:35.986 --> 10:36.399
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.499
Will you hold this, Ally?

10:42.740 --> 10:44.506
- Wow.
- I'm sorry, Detective Diaz,

10:44.508 --> 10:47.008
I know it's upsetting when a
hunch doesn't pan out.

10:47.010 --> 10:50.278
Well, it's over.
The flies have it.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.181
Keep your eyes on the flies.

10:53.183 --> 10:54.750
Flies don't lie.

10:54.752 --> 10:56.385
Now, that's a good one.

10:56.387 --> 10:59.121
Oh, no, it's Santiago's.
Damn it.

10:59.123 --> 11:00.622
Wow, this was a bad idea.

11:00.624 --> 11:02.758
Relax. He gets one
afternoon with Nikolaj,

11:02.760 --> 11:04.092
and he chooses basketball?

11:04.094 --> 11:05.694
Does Nikolaj even like
basketball?

11:05.696 --> 11:07.262
He loves the "Get Your Head
In The Game" number

11:07.264 --> 11:08.330
from "High School Musical."

11:08.332 --> 11:10.265
I haven't seen it, but I know
that's not the same.

11:10.267 --> 11:12.434
Look at them. Does it seem like
he's actually enjoying this?

11:12.436 --> 11:14.236
Porzingas!

11:14.238 --> 11:15.237
Charles, can I tell you a story?

11:15.239 --> 11:17.072
- Always.
- All right.

11:17.074 --> 11:18.240
When I was 10,

11:18.242 --> 11:20.275
my dad started dating
this woman, Leeza.

11:20.277 --> 11:23.311
My mom hated her.
But my dad wanted us to bond,

11:23.313 --> 11:25.781
so one day he took me and Leeza
to the mall and dropped us off.

11:25.783 --> 11:28.583
She proceeds to steal a ton
of blouses from Ann Taylor

11:28.585 --> 11:30.419
and then immediately makes
me go back in

11:30.421 --> 11:32.087
and exchange them
for store credit.

11:32.089 --> 11:33.255
Then to celebrate,

11:33.257 --> 11:34.423
I get to pull Leeza's
Cinnabon apart

11:34.425 --> 11:37.225
because her nails are too long
and curly to do it herself.

11:37.227 --> 11:38.593
- Ugh.
- Point being,

11:38.595 --> 11:40.128
nothing has ever made me love
my own mother

11:40.130 --> 11:42.764
more than the time I spent
with Leeza.

11:42.766 --> 11:44.466
Gintars is Leeza.

11:44.468 --> 11:45.767
You are my mom.

11:45.769 --> 11:47.302
I can't believe I get
to be Karen.

11:47.304 --> 11:48.437
What an honor!

11:48.439 --> 11:50.138
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Yes, sweetie?

11:50.140 --> 11:53.275
- Can we leave?
- Oh, no, so soon?

11:53.277 --> 11:55.477
But I understand.
We can go home right now.

11:55.479 --> 11:58.647
No, not home. Daddy Gintars
wants to buy me a jean jacket

11:58.649 --> 12:00.482
just like his.

12:00.484 --> 12:02.284
Daddy Gintars.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.085
Daddy Gintars.

12:04.087 --> 12:05.487
Oh, no.

12:05.489 --> 12:07.522
I am Leeza.

12:07.524 --> 12:08.590
Wait. No. That's not right.

12:14.945 --> 12:17.169
Hey, bud.
Everything going okay in here?

12:17.170 --> 12:18.571
I know you're going through
something,

12:18.578 --> 12:20.381
but people are starting to
complain about the moaning.

12:20.382 --> 12:23.382
Ugh. I would give anything
to have Gintars gone

12:23.384 --> 12:25.384
and out of Nikolaj's life.

12:25.386 --> 12:26.519
But it's not gonna happen.

12:26.521 --> 12:28.888
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
close the door, then.

12:28.890 --> 12:31.057
And you can feel free to moan
as much as you need.

12:33.328 --> 12:34.727
This is bad.

12:34.729 --> 12:36.696
I know. He's been
like that all day.

12:36.698 --> 12:37.697
No, I was talking
about your eyebrows.

12:37.699 --> 12:39.699
Whatever's going on up
there is real, real bad.

12:39.701 --> 12:42.869
Well, it's better than having
two bug hotels above your eyes.

12:42.871 --> 12:45.271
But wouldn't they also be
in your goatee?

12:45.273 --> 12:46.372
Don't do this to me, Jake.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.507
Wait a minute.

12:47.509 --> 12:49.008
I may have just thought of
a way to get rid of Gintars.

12:49.010 --> 12:50.076
Do you still have that friend

12:50.077 --> 12:51.412
who works on the
Counterfeiting Taskforce?

12:51.413 --> 12:52.391
Yeah, why?

12:52.392 --> 12:54.376
Gintars has this terrible
knock-off clothing brand

12:54.377 --> 12:54.881
called The Gape.

12:54.882 --> 12:56.851
If I can get him to admit on
tape that he's selling

12:56.853 --> 12:58.591
counterfeit goods,
they would terminate his visa

12:58.596 --> 12:59.495
- and deport him.
- Deport him?

13:00.161 --> 13:01.589
Doesn't that seem
a little extreme?

13:01.589 --> 13:02.887
Yeah, definitely, but Charles just said

13:02.888 --> 13:04.789
he'd give anything for Gintars to be gone.

13:05.030 --> 13:07.230
He's not doing great, Terry.

13:07.231 --> 13:07.603
Okay.

13:07.608 --> 13:09.550
But how are you gonna get
Gintars on tape?

13:09.551 --> 13:10.674
Good question,
Sergeant Crazy Brows.

13:10.679 --> 13:12.643
Gintars is always talking about
the Russian baths.

13:12.644 --> 13:13.813
I'll see if he'll meet me there

13:13.814 --> 13:15.347
and then ask him to cut me in
on his business.

13:15.479 --> 13:17.407
Meanwhile, I'll have a mic
hidden underneath my towel.

13:17.408 --> 13:18.407
It's foolproof.

13:18.409 --> 13:19.541
Before we do deal,

13:19.543 --> 13:20.576
we take off towel.

13:20.578 --> 13:22.878
It's full naked.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.246
Ha.

13:24.248 --> 13:25.227
What are you waiting for?

13:25.228 --> 13:27.450
I want to see where your hair
starts and stops.

13:27.453 --> 13:29.053
Gintars.

13:29.055 --> 13:31.055
Take it off now.

13:31.057 --> 13:32.423
Heh.

13:32.425 --> 13:33.558
Hey, Sarge.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.942
Holy crap.
What the hell is that?

13:35.943 --> 13:38.372
That is a bug-free zone
is what it is.

13:38.373 --> 13:40.673
I bleached it.
I'm smarter than they are, Rosa.

13:40.675 --> 13:41.541
Uh-huh.
What about your nose hair?

13:41.543 --> 13:44.944
Oh, man. Terry forgot
about his nose.

13:44.946 --> 13:46.700
Hey, why is Yee still here?

13:46.701 --> 13:49.449
Holt wants him to hand in his
case report in person.

13:49.451 --> 13:51.651
I think he's trying to trick him
into going to lunch with him.

13:51.653 --> 13:53.152
Wait. It's noon?

13:53.154 --> 13:55.622
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that was lunchtime.

13:55.624 --> 13:57.490
I hope they take that
container of bugs with them

13:57.492 --> 13:58.891
- when they go.
- Wait. The container's here?

13:58.893 --> 13:59.993
I have an idea.

13:59.995 --> 14:02.695
- All I need is some blood.
- This is fresh.

14:02.697 --> 14:04.063
Oh. Terrible, yet perfect.

14:10.038 --> 14:11.671
Stupid bugs didn't do anything.

14:11.673 --> 14:13.139
He lied to us, Sarge.,

14:14.676 --> 14:15.875
Huh?

14:15.877 --> 14:16.876
Why's your towel still on?

14:16.878 --> 14:18.544
This is business conversation.

14:18.546 --> 14:20.847
You cannot trust a man who
cannot show you his full self.

14:20.849 --> 14:22.515
Well, not in America.

14:22.517 --> 14:24.717
Here we have business meetings
fully clothed.

14:24.719 --> 14:26.019
Sometimes even in
a suit and tie.

14:26.021 --> 14:27.186
Have you ever seen the show
"Shark Tank"?

14:27.188 --> 14:29.555
Latvian "Shark Tank"
is all nude.

14:29.557 --> 14:30.890
That sounds weirdly sexy.

14:30.892 --> 14:31.891
No, not at all.

14:31.893 --> 14:33.693
There's no female sharks,

14:33.695 --> 14:36.529
so it's just four
Mr. Wonderfuls naked

14:36.531 --> 14:37.997
on a big leather couch.

14:37.999 --> 14:39.832
Huh. Not what I imagined.

14:39.834 --> 14:41.701
Hey, listen.

14:41.703 --> 14:43.870
I would love to buy some of
that knock-off denim.

14:43.872 --> 14:45.505
Okay, first of all,
it's not knock-off.

14:45.507 --> 14:47.507
Okay, Gape is true,
authentic brand.

14:47.509 --> 14:49.575
The real thief is Gap.

14:49.577 --> 14:51.060
- Are they?
- What makes more sense?

14:51.065 --> 14:53.324
That they take Gape
and remove letter?

14:53.325 --> 14:57.161
Or that I take Gap
and add pricey E?

14:57.163 --> 14:59.450
I don't care if it's fake,
I just wanna buy some.

14:59.451 --> 15:02.073
It's not fake;
You are still wearing a towel;

15:02.074 --> 15:04.107
And this deal: Over.

15:04.109 --> 15:06.043
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

15:06.045 --> 15:09.079
Do you wanna know why
I won't take off my towel?

15:09.081 --> 15:10.213
It's because I'm embarrassed...

15:10.215 --> 15:13.050
about what's underneath.

15:13.052 --> 15:14.084
Mutilated penis?

15:14.086 --> 15:15.852
Ye... p.

15:15.854 --> 15:17.888
That is it. You guessed it
on the first try.

15:17.890 --> 15:20.624
That's what's under there.
The old... the old...

15:20.626 --> 15:23.193
- mute peen.
- I am so sorry about your penis.

15:23.195 --> 15:24.009
It's a bummer.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.045
But we all have things
that bring us shame.

15:27.047 --> 15:28.313
Remember when I told you before

15:28.315 --> 15:32.095
that Gape was original, authentic brand?
I do. It was just now.

15:32.096 --> 15:33.929
Yeah, well...

15:33.931 --> 15:35.631
I stole the whole thing
from Gap.

15:35.633 --> 15:38.133
And here I was
completely believing you

15:38.135 --> 15:39.501
when you told me you didn't.

15:39.503 --> 15:40.803
Wow.

15:40.805 --> 15:42.605
Well, thank you for sharing
that with me.

15:42.607 --> 15:46.475
You are freak.
But I support you. Come.

15:46.477 --> 15:48.644
Oh, no, it's a naked hug.

15:48.646 --> 15:50.779
Ha ha.
Ah.

15:51.782 --> 15:52.715
Hey, what's up?

15:52.717 --> 15:54.116
You guys having a little coffee?
That's cool.

15:54.118 --> 15:55.417
- Yee's a fraud.
- What?

15:55.425 --> 15:56.223
Excuse me?

15:56.224 --> 15:58.406
Those nasty-ass bugs
don't smell blood.

15:58.407 --> 16:00.173
And they must not smell
bullcrap, either,

16:00.174 --> 16:01.340
'cause he's spewing it
everywhere.

16:01.434 --> 16:03.526
What are you saying out
of your weird face?

16:03.529 --> 16:05.002
We put the flies
near fresh blood,

16:05.003 --> 16:07.456
and nothing happened.
They didn't react at all.

16:07.457 --> 16:10.525
Do you know how stupid
these accusations sound?

16:10.526 --> 16:12.488
- Diaz, you're fired.
- What?

16:12.504 --> 16:16.605
Dr. Yee is one of the most respected
forensic experts in the country.

16:16.612 --> 16:18.445
For you two...
Let's not mince words...

16:18.446 --> 16:22.374
Common fools to suggest
that you found the flaw

16:22.375 --> 16:23.574
- in this brilliant man's...
- They're right.

16:23.576 --> 16:24.508
- What?
- Huh?

16:24.510 --> 16:29.280
The flies don't sense blood.
They're just regular flies.

16:29.282 --> 16:30.648
But, Dr. Yee,
you can't be a fraud.

16:30.650 --> 16:31.974
You gave a TED Talk.

16:31.975 --> 16:35.364
I spent $6 million in federal
grant money on this experiment

16:35.365 --> 16:36.280
and I've gotten nowhere.

16:36.281 --> 16:39.331
The closest I ever came was when
they all landed on a popsicle once.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.831
But in the apartment we saw
them react to a cotton swab

16:41.857 --> 16:43.688
dipped in blood.
It was melted popsicle.

16:43.689 --> 16:45.907
Jam works, too,
but it's more expensive.

16:45.909 --> 16:48.509
So, Sir, you were saying
something about us being

16:48.511 --> 16:51.179
- common fools?
- So who looks stupid now?

16:51.181 --> 16:53.181
Uh, Terry, your
left eyebrow is missing.

16:53.183 --> 16:57.151
Oh, I must have rubbed it off.
There it is.

16:57.153 --> 16:58.486
Who looks stupid now?

17:00.357 --> 17:02.824
Jake, hey, I got it, man.

17:02.826 --> 17:06.704
Nice jeans, and the good thing is
look... both legs, same length.

17:06.704 --> 17:08.037
Thank you very much.

17:08.039 --> 17:09.506
And I see it's 100% denim-ish.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.614
"Caution: Do not wear near
women who are pregnant

17:11.615 --> 17:12.873
- or breast-feeding."
- This is true.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.330
The nipple may fall off.

17:14.332 --> 17:16.877
Hey, guys.
Gintars said to meet him here.

17:16.878 --> 17:17.615
I didn't realize
you were coming.

17:17.617 --> 17:19.895
My man, I'ma wrestle you.
Come here.

17:19.896 --> 17:21.715
Charles, what are you doing here?
Why is Nikolaj here?

17:21.721 --> 17:23.683
Oh, he's been so happy
since he met Gintars.

17:23.684 --> 17:26.381
I've been focusing on myself and
not really thinking about Nikolaj.

17:26.384 --> 17:27.473
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't realize how much

17:27.473 --> 17:29.570
it meant to him to know he
hadn't been abandoned.

17:29.572 --> 17:31.366
I'm okay with them having
a relationship.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.199
Wow, that is so great
of you, Charles,

17:33.202 --> 17:35.373
but I really wish you'd included me
in your decision-making process.

17:35.374 --> 17:36.420
- Why?
- No reason.

17:36.421 --> 17:39.055
I just maybe went in a different, less
mature direction.

17:39.538 --> 17:41.376
Hey, maybe we should leave
this area, like, right now.

17:41.377 --> 17:42.946
Cop car.
How's it going?

17:42.950 --> 17:45.043
- Hey, man.
- Gintars Irbe, you're under arrest

17:45.044 --> 17:47.450
- for selling counterfeit goods.
- Jake! You set me up.

17:47.456 --> 17:55.195
- Do you even have mutilated penis?
- No. It's perfect.

17:58.633 --> 17:59.600
Okay.

17:59.602 --> 18:02.069
So they are taking Gintars to the
airport and they're not hurting him...

18:02.071 --> 18:04.371
any more than they did when
he was resisting arrest.

18:05.741 --> 18:07.241
Now they won't let him go
just because I asked them to

18:07.243 --> 18:09.343
even though they arrested him
just because I asked them to.

18:09.345 --> 18:11.441
It's a crazy system.
I don't understand it.

18:11.443 --> 18:12.220
But here's what I'm thinking:

18:12.221 --> 18:14.181
- I call the State Department...
- You've done enough, Jake.

18:14.183 --> 18:15.270
That's nice of you to say, but...

18:15.271 --> 18:17.884
- My tone wasn't nice.
- But your tone is always nice with me.

18:17.950 --> 18:19.357
Wait a minute.
Are you mad?

18:19.359 --> 18:21.753
Yes, because you butted into a
situation you shouldn't have.

18:21.754 --> 18:23.234
You need to keep your butt
in your pants.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.679
My butt was only out because you
said you wanted Gintars gone.

18:25.683 --> 18:27.082
Well, thanks to your butt,

18:27.084 --> 18:29.685
Nikolaj feels like he's been
abandoned all over again.

18:29.687 --> 18:32.004
Okay, but my butt was the one that
got them together in the first place.

18:32.005 --> 18:33.344
I don't feel like my butt is
getting credit for that.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.435
Well, that's because your butt
was inappropriate then too.

18:35.437 --> 18:37.098
Your butt should have never
been a part of this.

18:37.106 --> 18:40.346
So now I gotta go clean up the big
nasty mess that your butt made.

18:40.349 --> 18:42.142
But my butt no but...

18:42.144 --> 18:43.410
My butt no but!

18:43.412 --> 18:47.253
Diaz, Jeffords, Santiago would like
to apologize to you for her behavior.

18:47.254 --> 18:49.421
- I thought we were both apologizing.
- No, I misunderstood.

18:49.423 --> 18:51.490
What would I be apologizing for?

18:51.491 --> 18:53.361
- The same thing as me?
- Really?

18:53.362 --> 18:55.124
You guys maybe want to have
this conversation on your own?

18:55.763 --> 18:58.030
Yes.
Okay, we have come to a decision

18:58.032 --> 19:01.233
that we would both like to apologize.

19:01.235 --> 19:05.337
We should have trusted your
instincts over Dr. Yee and his flies.

19:05.339 --> 19:05.714
And?

19:05.715 --> 19:08.475
And we shouldn't have been
so insulting.

19:08.476 --> 19:09.842
And?

19:09.844 --> 19:11.310
I'm not gonna apologize
for your face.

19:11.312 --> 19:12.878
That mess is clearly on you.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.313
- Fair enough.
- I'll ask Commissioner Kelly

19:14.315 --> 19:16.882
to approve your initial request
for an FBI lab team.

19:16.884 --> 19:18.551
That won't be necessary.
I solved the case.

19:18.553 --> 19:19.952
And the flies actually
came in handy.

19:19.954 --> 19:22.455
These have been genetically
engineered

19:22.457 --> 19:24.890
to detect blood, and
there's a whole swarm of them

19:24.892 --> 19:28.060
at your apartment right now
with Dr. Ronald Yee.

19:28.062 --> 19:29.395
The flies don't lie.

19:29.397 --> 19:31.230
- He confessed immediately.
- How about that.

19:31.232 --> 19:34.066
Dr. Yee and his flies
saved the day after all.

19:34.068 --> 19:35.067
No, I did.

19:35.069 --> 19:36.840
Should we call Yee
and tell him the good news?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.941
It would probably
make him feel so much better.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.200
- What is going on?
- He did seem so sad.

19:41.201 --> 19:43.568
- So sad.
- He should be sad. He's a fraud.

19:43.570 --> 19:45.069
Shh. It's ringing.

19:46.573 --> 19:49.173
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:49.175 --> 19:50.308
Did you make it to the airport
in time to see Gintars?

19:50.310 --> 19:54.078
Yes, but TSA wouldn't let him
stay in the country.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.013
At least Nikolaj got
to spend a few hours

19:56.015 --> 19:57.915
with his birth father
at a Chili's Too.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.851
Chili's As Well.

20:00.854 --> 20:03.254
Listen, I feel bad, and I
wanted to do something

20:03.256 --> 20:04.255
but I know you didn't
want my help,

20:04.257 --> 20:06.424
so long story short,

20:06.426 --> 20:09.427
I made us these hats.

20:09.429 --> 20:11.362
I obviously love them.

20:11.364 --> 20:12.930
They don't change
how I'm feeling.

20:12.932 --> 20:15.166
Okay.

20:15.168 --> 20:17.201
Well, I'm sorry that
I messed things up.

20:17.203 --> 20:19.987
But I was just trying
to be a good friend.

20:19.988 --> 20:22.222
I know, but that doesn't
always mean fixing my life.

20:22.224 --> 20:24.858
You shouldn't have done
anything without asking me.

20:24.860 --> 20:27.026
Sometimes I just want you
to listen.

20:27.028 --> 20:28.728
Right.

20:28.730 --> 20:30.230
I hear that.

20:30.232 --> 20:33.800
It's just...
adoption is complicated.

20:33.802 --> 20:35.201
No matter how much I want to be,

20:35.203 --> 20:36.803
I'm not Nikolaj's real father.

20:36.805 --> 20:39.038
Come on, Charles.
Of course you are.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.907
Well, that'll be up to him.

20:40.909 --> 20:43.743
And he may even change his mind
about it throughout his life.

20:43.745 --> 20:48.181
I mean, all I can do
is make him feel safe

20:48.183 --> 20:50.150
and give him as much love
as I can.

20:50.152 --> 20:54.721
Well, I think Nikolaj is very
lucky to have you.

20:54.723 --> 20:57.023
Nikolaj.

20:57.407 --> 20:59.140
Okay. Let's take these hats
out for a spin.

20:59.142 --> 21:00.141
I've waited long enough.

21:00.143 --> 21:01.450
Here you go.
Best Bud #1.

21:01.451 --> 21:02.880
You'd rather be Best Bud #2?

21:02.881 --> 21:04.294
I just want you to listen
a little more.

21:04.295 --> 21:05.640
I don't wanna change
our whole dynamic.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.674
Okay, good, 'cause I really
wanted to be Best Bud #1.

21:07.691 --> 21:09.524
- I know you did.
- Clink!

21:09.526 --> 21:11.486
- Oh, they're way too small.
- Ooh, they're tight.

21:11.488 --> 21:12.464
- They're way too small.
- Hurt.

21:12.465 --> 21:19.636
They don't fit.
