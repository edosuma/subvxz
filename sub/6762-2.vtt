01:35.735 --> 01:37.395
What time does
the express bus leave?

01:37.612 --> 01:39.403
Six-thirty.

01:40.449 --> 01:42.322
You'd better get going.

01:48.457 --> 01:50.165
What's with you?

01:50.751 --> 01:54.202
- Job burnout.
- After one week?

01:54.380 --> 01:57.001
lt's the toughest job
l ever had, Dad.

01:57.175 --> 02:00.010
Spending your day at the beach
doesn't sound all that difficult.

02:00.178 --> 02:03.594
Oh, but you have no idea
what my day is like.

02:04.349 --> 02:06.057
l'm the first one there
in the morning,

02:06.226 --> 02:08.134
practically the last one
to leave at night.

02:08.312 --> 02:09.425
And l'm so busy all day,

02:09.604 --> 02:12.641
the only way l know l'm at the beach
is because my shoes are full of sand.

02:12.817 --> 02:17.194
Well, there's no free lunch, Brandon.
You get what you pay for in this world.

02:17.989 --> 02:22.236
But you see, if you were to pay for...

02:22.411 --> 02:26.278
...oh, let's say,
half of what my car costs,

02:26.457 --> 02:29.826
l could quit
and actually pretend it's summer.

02:31.712 --> 02:33.835
Have a nice day, Brandon.

03:16.303 --> 03:19.754
- Out.
- Out? Out? What do you mean, out?

03:19.931 --> 03:21.176
You were standing right there.

03:21.350 --> 03:23.259
- Take it over.
- Take it over? lf it wasn't in,

03:23.435 --> 03:25.143
it was out!
How could you not see it?

03:25.354 --> 03:27.346
- l didn't see it.
- l saw it.

03:27.565 --> 03:32.061
You saw it? All right, listen, okay?
Whatever the kid says, goes, okay?

03:32.237 --> 03:33.779
That's fair, all right? And?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.478
So, nice shot.

03:35.699 --> 03:38.450
Oh, thank you very much.
The game is over!

03:38.618 --> 03:39.780
Fix, fix.

03:39.995 --> 03:45.369
Oh, come on. You heard the kid.
Clearly an objective, neutral observer.

03:45.543 --> 03:48.876
And an envelope with your 20s
will be waiting for you at the front desk.

03:49.088 --> 03:52.457
Oh, come on Edgar, l'm gonna buy.
All right, all right, all right.

03:52.634 --> 03:55.006
- All right, who won?
- Who always wins?

03:55.178 --> 03:58.132
- Who always cheats?
- You tell him, Edgar.

03:59.141 --> 04:03.435
Listen, for the record, would you
please tell Miss Cynical what you saw.

04:03.646 --> 04:04.844
The shot was in.

04:05.064 --> 04:06.973
l told you Brandon was a quick study.

04:07.191 --> 04:09.764
But you never told me
he was so cute.

04:09.944 --> 04:13.277
Who cares what he looks like
as long as he has good eyesight?

04:13.823 --> 04:16.906
- Thank you very much, Henry.
- Thank you, Mr. Rattinger.

04:19.370 --> 04:22.241
Are you Jerry Rattinger?
The sports promoter?

04:22.416 --> 04:23.696
Guilty as charged.

04:23.876 --> 04:25.749
l think you know my father,
Jim Walsh.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.208
Jim Walsh is your old man? Okay.

04:28.381 --> 04:30.290
Hey, listen,
l hear he's thinking about joining.

04:30.508 --> 04:32.132
- Yeah.
- Okay, all right.

04:32.302 --> 04:34.590
Listen, l won't hold it against you.

04:40.436 --> 04:42.974
- Hey, stranger, what's happening?
- Man, how are the waves?

04:43.147 --> 04:47.097
Oh, ugly, flat, closed out. Other than
that, they're pretty bitchen, though.

04:47.276 --> 04:49.019
So how you doing otherwise?

04:49.195 --> 04:52.196
Okay. Henry's cool,
lets me park my board here

04:52.365 --> 04:53.989
even though
Dad's not a member anymore.

04:54.159 --> 04:57.991
Yeah, Henry is cool. So is Sandy.

04:59.540 --> 05:05.080
No, Sandy is exquisite.
Just don't tell her l said so.

05:10.134 --> 05:12.173
Listen, man,
l'm sorry about you and Brenda.

05:12.887 --> 05:15.259
Don't worry about it, man.
Things happen, you know.

05:15.432 --> 05:17.175
Big Jimbo must be skying, though.

05:18.977 --> 05:20.471
You're welcome
to come over any time,

05:20.646 --> 05:22.188
no matter what happened
between you.

05:22.398 --> 05:23.975
Thanks, man. l might do that.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.648
- Take it easy.
- Late.

05:27.236 --> 05:29.941
Now, l've asked Brenda to bring in
her mom's winter coat

05:30.156 --> 05:33.406
so that we could demonstrate
a sense-memory process.

05:33.577 --> 05:35.616
This is the exact coat
your mom was wearing, right?

05:35.787 --> 05:39.037
- Yes.
- Please tell the story.

05:40.417 --> 05:43.750
Well, it's about the time
that l got lost in the department store.

05:43.921 --> 05:46.163
l was supposed to stay
with my brother, Brandon,

05:46.340 --> 05:50.503
but instead l decided l would take
a little adventure on the escalators.

05:50.678 --> 05:53.679
Well, 30 minutes later, my parents
were convinced that l was kidnapped.

05:53.849 --> 05:57.514
And all l really remember
was feeling intense panic.

05:57.728 --> 06:00.598
But the $64,000 question is:

06:00.773 --> 06:04.984
Can Brenda Walsh re-create
the emotions of being lost and found

06:05.152 --> 06:09.695
by re-creating the smell and the texture
of wet winter wool?

06:10.116 --> 06:11.942
l think she can.

06:17.249 --> 06:19.740
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You did great.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.126
When the tears came, it just felt
so forced. lt wasn't right.

06:23.297 --> 06:26.048
God, it must be
really, really cold back there.

06:26.217 --> 06:27.545
lt's beyond cold.

06:27.719 --> 06:30.007
Well, it gives me the chills
just thinking about it.

06:30.180 --> 06:34.260
See, Kelly, if you took drama class,
you could use those feelings.

06:34.434 --> 06:36.426
l think l'll stick with the beach,
thanks.

06:36.603 --> 06:38.429
Have fun.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.314
You're not gonna go?

06:40.482 --> 06:44.266
No, l'm gonna try and work on this
sense-memory stuff some more.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.066
- Give me a break, Brenda.
- No, it's true, Kelly.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.573
A creative person can't be afraid
to follow his or her artistic impulses.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.780
No matter where
they may take him, or her.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.413
Very well put, David.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.539
And since Brenda
will be staying in town,

06:57.710 --> 07:01.838
now there's room in your car for me
to go to the beach instead.

07:02.882 --> 07:06.251
lt's okay.
l don't mind sitting in the back seat.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.304
Thank you.

07:11.182 --> 07:12.557
Have fun.

07:12.726 --> 07:15.513
- Call me later.
- Yeah.

07:17.314 --> 07:18.724
So, what are you doing?

07:18.899 --> 07:23.276
Same as you,
avoid going to the beach.

07:23.613 --> 07:25.486
lt's that obvious, huh?

07:27.116 --> 07:30.651
l just feel that if l ran into Dylan,
l couldn't deal with it.

07:31.371 --> 07:35.155
l don't know if l can be myself
this summer without totally blowing it.

07:36.335 --> 07:38.411
Brenda, tell me...

07:39.797 --> 07:43.000
...has Brandon asked about me?

08:12.040 --> 08:14.246
Great bunch of people at this club.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.832
Let me tell you something
about the rich, Brandon.

08:17.004 --> 08:19.625
They're different from you and me.

08:19.924 --> 08:22.878
So said F. Scott Fitzgerald
in The Great Gatsby.

08:23.052 --> 08:25.009
That's very good.

08:25.179 --> 08:27.717
- You read it, huh?
- Yeah, l read it.

08:27.891 --> 08:31.723
A long time ago.
Probably before you were born.

08:31.895 --> 08:34.136
- Oh, you think so?
- Well, l don't know.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.688
How old are you, anyway?

08:36.482 --> 08:39.933
l don't know.
How old do you want me to be?

08:44.993 --> 08:47.484
So summer is definitely
the best time of the year, Granny.

08:48.413 --> 08:50.904
Oh, and l love my acting class
at school.

08:51.083 --> 08:54.203
Our teacher, Mr. Suiter, is so brilliant,
and he's really teaching us

08:54.378 --> 08:56.536
how to get in touch
with our emotions from childhood.

08:56.714 --> 09:00.165
Honey, if we don't leave now, we're not
gonna get to the Beach Club on time.

09:00.343 --> 09:01.885
You're going
to the Beach Club tonight?

09:02.053 --> 09:05.054
One of your father's clients
has invited us to join.

09:05.223 --> 09:07.381
The Beverly Hills Beach Club?

09:07.559 --> 09:10.679
They're having a big party
to honour prospective members.

09:11.563 --> 09:14.932
Hold on. The Beverly Hills Beach Club
where Brandon works?

09:15.109 --> 09:16.852
lsn't that a hoot?

09:17.027 --> 09:18.735
Granny, hold on.

09:18.904 --> 09:21.395
Does Brandon know
that you're going there tonight?

09:21.574 --> 09:23.650
Yeah. Why don't you join us?

09:23.826 --> 09:27.954
Oh, no, no, l can't,
l'm talking to Grandma.

09:39.176 --> 09:42.545
- New members.
- Come dance with me.

09:42.722 --> 09:44.097
Would you? Would you?

09:46.351 --> 09:48.723
- Do you do this with all the women?
- All the women.

09:48.895 --> 09:49.926
While you're working?

09:50.105 --> 09:51.599
Of course when l'm working,
when else?

09:51.773 --> 09:53.765
Well, l don't know,
how do you get anything done?

09:53.942 --> 09:55.104
l don't.

09:55.277 --> 09:57.565
Hey, you two.
Now, you know the rules.

09:57.738 --> 09:59.777
Employees can't be seen
having fun in public

09:59.949 --> 10:01.147
during a new-member function.

10:01.325 --> 10:03.650
Don't worry, darling.
Sandy will take good care of you.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.277
Now, don't you go corrupting
this fine young man.

10:06.498 --> 10:08.953
l wouldn't dream of it.

10:11.587 --> 10:13.496
Neither would l.

10:13.923 --> 10:15.631
Brandon.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.506
- Hi.
- Hey, where have you guys been?

10:18.719 --> 10:20.676
- l was worried about you.
- lt's a long story.

10:20.847 --> 10:23.931
Yeah, well, rumour has it your father
made a wrong turn at Topanga.

10:24.142 --> 10:27.143
lt said Zuma Beach,
the sign said ''Zuma Beach this way.''

10:27.312 --> 10:29.185
- l took the turn...
- Whatever you say, Jim.

10:29.356 --> 10:31.182
- Whatever you say.
- Jerry, give me a break.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.354
We'll forgive you anything
as long as you pay your dues on time.

10:34.528 --> 10:37.778
That way your son can become
a beach bum like the rest of the kids.

10:37.949 --> 10:40.356
- Sounds good to me.
- Don't get any ideas.

10:40.535 --> 10:42.860
- Jerry, we really ought to find a table.
- Okay.

10:43.079 --> 10:45.451
- All right, you guys, have fun.
- Nice call today.

10:45.665 --> 10:48.535
- l call them like l see them.
- Yeah, well...

10:48.710 --> 10:51.117
We'll get you on the court.
Teach you a couple of tricks.

10:51.338 --> 10:54.292
- Anytime.
- You got it.

10:55.593 --> 10:57.087
lsn't it a small world?

10:57.261 --> 10:59.087
My dad's an executive tax specialist,

10:59.263 --> 11:01.302
he just started working
on the Rattinger account.

11:01.474 --> 11:04.428
Yep, a very small world.

11:14.655 --> 11:16.232
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Walsh.

11:16.407 --> 11:17.605
- Steve.
- How are you?

11:17.783 --> 11:19.407
- Hey.
- l hear you might join the club.

11:19.577 --> 11:21.320
We're definitely thinking about it.

11:21.496 --> 11:23.654
lf you love the beach,
this is the place to come.

11:23.832 --> 11:25.741
He throws his second left--

11:25.917 --> 11:27.245
Hey, bro, l just saw your folks.

11:27.419 --> 11:29.127
lt's pretty wild,
they might join the club.

11:29.296 --> 11:32.166
Yeah. Hey, party up.
The grunion run tonight.

11:32.341 --> 11:33.835
lsn't it a little late for that?

11:34.009 --> 11:36.251
l don't make the schedule,
ask the fish.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.460
Grunion are fish?

11:37.638 --> 11:39.796
Yeah, the ultimate
California party fish.

11:39.974 --> 11:42.132
They come to the beach
a couple nights every summer

11:42.310 --> 11:44.136
to lay their eggs, so to speak.

11:44.312 --> 11:48.392
Yeah, Donna will be there. Kelly,
Dushane, Linda, Kyle, everybody!

11:48.567 --> 11:49.895
- Sounds like a happening.
- Yeah.

11:50.069 --> 11:52.227
You might want to ask
your lady friend, if you like.

11:52.404 --> 11:54.562
Steve, l think Sandy's got more
important things to do

11:54.740 --> 11:56.898
than hang out on the beach
with high school kids.

11:57.076 --> 11:59.199
Judging by the way
she was checking you out all day,

11:59.370 --> 12:03.070
l think you're the only high school kid
she's interested in hanging out with.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.281
lt's just an opinion.

12:12.468 --> 12:15.385
Well, Harry, another day,
another dollar, huh?

12:15.555 --> 12:18.805
Hey, listen, l know it's kind of
last-minute, it's cool to say no,

12:18.975 --> 12:22.675
but if you're not doing anything tonight,
the grunion are running.

12:24.481 --> 12:29.273
At which beach do you propose
we go to watch this miracle of nature?

12:29.862 --> 12:31.486
Here.

12:32.448 --> 12:35.484
Or wherever it is they usually run.

12:37.328 --> 12:38.703
They can come ashore anywhere

12:38.871 --> 12:41.077
between Point Conception
and the Mexican border.

12:41.291 --> 12:42.489
But l really wouldn't know.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.955
Because after 1 2 years
of living in Los Angeles,

12:45.128 --> 12:46.456
l've never actually seen them.

12:46.672 --> 12:48.166
ln fact, l don't think they exist,

12:48.382 --> 12:50.955
but you know what?
lf you run into any, give them my best.

12:53.012 --> 12:54.672
Excuse me,
did l say something wrong?

12:54.847 --> 12:55.878
No.

12:56.057 --> 12:58.844
Well, obviously l did something
to rub you the wrong way.

12:59.018 --> 13:01.556
Why didn't you introduce me
to your parents?

13:01.730 --> 13:03.224
l didn't know
you wanted to meet them.

13:03.398 --> 13:05.604
We were standing next to them
about half a dozen times.

13:05.776 --> 13:08.481
lt would have been real easy to say,
''This is my friend from work.''

13:08.654 --> 13:10.112
Leave it at that.

13:11.365 --> 13:13.690
l didn't think you cared
about stuff like that.

13:13.868 --> 13:14.899
Don't flatter yourself.

13:15.703 --> 13:17.411
Oh, come on, Sandy.

13:17.580 --> 13:20.071
l'm sorry, all right?
Go ahead and shoot me.

13:20.250 --> 13:23.120
lt's not you. lt's just...

13:23.545 --> 13:26.711
Your parents seem like
really wholesome types.

13:27.382 --> 13:30.133
l'm not all that crazy
about people from Beverly Hills.

13:30.719 --> 13:32.795
That's okay. We're from Minnesota.

13:33.598 --> 13:35.721
But now you go
to Beverly Hills High School.

13:35.933 --> 13:37.178
Actually, l go to West Beverly,

13:37.352 --> 13:40.269
but l could transfer to West Podunk,
if that would make you happy.

13:40.438 --> 13:41.517
The way my head's pounding,

13:41.690 --> 13:44.228
l don't think anything
could make me happy tonight.

13:45.152 --> 13:47.144
Not even the sight

13:47.321 --> 13:51.235
of 1 0,000 wild and crazy grunion
having an orgy on the beach?

13:53.703 --> 13:55.327
l know it's a long shot,

13:55.496 --> 13:57.239
but stranger things
have happened.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.746
Yeah, stranger things
have happened.

14:00.961 --> 14:02.419
So is that a yes?

14:03.088 --> 14:04.368
lt's a ''let me think about it.''

14:04.548 --> 14:06.421
Before you make
this magnanimous decision,

14:06.592 --> 14:09.593
l probably should tell you
that some of my high school friends

14:09.762 --> 14:12.217
are gonna be down there,
if that makes a difference to you.

14:12.390 --> 14:13.718
Does it make a difference to you?

14:14.559 --> 14:15.590
No.

14:18.396 --> 14:20.721
Let's go find ourselves
some party fish.

14:30.576 --> 14:32.449
Brandon, how many times
do l have to remind you

14:32.620 --> 14:33.995
to put your clothes in the hamper

14:34.163 --> 14:36.155
instead of throwing them
on the floor like a slob?

14:36.332 --> 14:38.704
Sorry, Bren,
l got home a little late last night.

14:38.877 --> 14:41.794
Well, now the bathroom smells
like fish, thank you very much.

14:41.963 --> 14:44.917
Well, believe me, there were no fish
anywhere on the beach last night.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.843
We waited for hours for them
not to show up.

14:48.012 --> 14:52.175
- lt was just like Sandy predicted.
- Sandy?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.302
As in a girl named Sandy?

14:55.103 --> 14:57.309
As in a woman named Sandy.

14:57.480 --> 15:02.189
- How old is this Sandy person?
- l don't know, she won't tell me.

15:03.070 --> 15:06.273
That is a definite sign
of someone being old.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.990
l know.

15:13.790 --> 15:14.821
Hey, Dad.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.279
- Good morning.
- Morning, Dad.

15:16.459 --> 15:18.535
You guys left the party
a little early, didn't you?

15:18.712 --> 15:20.918
Did we? Yeah, l guess we did.

15:21.089 --> 15:23.924
So is it gonna be a Beverly Hills
Beach Club kind of a summer?

15:29.557 --> 15:32.392
l'm sorry. l'm just having a little bit
of trouble understanding this.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.636
Didn't you guys say
you had a great time last night?

15:34.812 --> 15:36.389
Yes, we did.

15:36.564 --> 15:39.481
- And you love the beach.
- Yes, we do.

15:39.651 --> 15:40.682
So, what's the problem?

15:41.737 --> 15:43.776
lt's not a problem.

15:43.947 --> 15:47.647
lt's just, when you factor in the costs
of joining a beach club,

15:47.827 --> 15:49.025
the numbers just don't add up.

15:49.203 --> 15:51.908
We'd rather spend the money
on your college tuition.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.243
Oh, so it's a money thing?

15:55.251 --> 15:58.205
- lt's not just a money thing.
- Then what kind of thing is it, Dad?

15:59.339 --> 16:01.331
Hobnobbing with the Jerry Rattingers
of the world

16:01.508 --> 16:05.091
can be a lot of fun for a night or two,
but in the long run,

16:05.262 --> 16:07.468
l think it's much safer
to keep your professional life

16:07.640 --> 16:08.885
separate from your social life.

16:09.225 --> 16:10.600
What social life?

16:12.228 --> 16:13.426
Sorry, l couldn't help myself.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.931
So you think the club is too
Beverly Hills chichi

16:17.108 --> 16:18.566
for your Midwestern taste buds,

16:18.735 --> 16:20.193
- is that it?
- Did l say that?

16:20.362 --> 16:23.612
l'm trying to figure out why a place
that 99 percent of the population

16:23.782 --> 16:26.569
is dying to get into
is not good enough for us to join.

16:26.994 --> 16:28.536
Because it's my decision.

16:28.746 --> 16:30.738
There's nothing any of us
can say to change that?

16:30.957 --> 16:33.163
- What else is there to say?
- That's exactly my point.

16:33.334 --> 16:35.457
- Thanks for breakfast, Mom.
- Where are you going?

16:35.628 --> 16:38.415
- To the Beach Club.
- l thought today was your day off.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.084
lt is.

16:52.438 --> 16:54.477
What was that?
Beginner's luck too?

16:54.649 --> 16:56.855
- You must be a good teacher.
- The best.

16:58.737 --> 17:00.895
Oh, what l could teach a kid like you.

17:01.365 --> 17:03.938
- lt'd be like money in the bank.
- So who's stopping you?

17:06.203 --> 17:08.242
Listen, how expensive
is this car you wanna get?

17:08.414 --> 17:10.074
Thirty-five hundred.

17:10.249 --> 17:12.040
He won't co-sign a loan,
give you an advance?

17:12.210 --> 17:13.667
We haven't really talked about it.

17:13.837 --> 17:15.663
Well, what do you two discuss?

17:15.839 --> 17:18.045
Not much really.
l haven't seen him lately.

17:18.215 --> 17:21.714
- We're both working too hard.
- That's wrong.

17:21.887 --> 17:24.804
l mean, that's wrong.

17:25.141 --> 17:27.180
- Now you're 1 6, what, 1 7 years old?
- Yeah.

17:27.351 --> 17:30.221
Okay, if you can't take off
for a summer vacation now,

17:30.396 --> 17:32.721
l mean, when you're supposed to,
when are you gonna do it?

17:32.899 --> 17:36.268
When you have to work
every day to support a family?

17:36.444 --> 17:37.772
Tell it to him.

17:37.946 --> 17:39.938
When l was a kid,
he didn't want me to play hockey

17:40.115 --> 17:42.688
because it conflicted
with my paper route.

17:44.995 --> 17:49.158
Listen, all right, far be it from me
to criticise your old man,

17:49.333 --> 17:53.283
and God knows that the Beverly Hills
Beach Club ain't for everybody.

17:53.463 --> 17:54.838
But you just...

17:55.006 --> 17:58.589
You can't make the kind of
connections that you need to make

17:58.760 --> 18:01.002
crunching numbers
in the Wilshire District.

18:01.764 --> 18:04.848
Your father's a very sincere,
hardworking guy,

18:05.017 --> 18:07.768
but his head's still
a little in meat-and-potato land.

18:10.148 --> 18:11.428
So you want me to talk to him?

18:13.568 --> 18:16.237
No, thanks. l'll give it another shot.

18:17.489 --> 18:20.276
So, what kind of car
are you lusting after anyway?

18:21.493 --> 18:24.743
- Sixty-five Mustang convertible.
- Right, l had one of those.

18:24.914 --> 18:27.998
Oh, yes, absolutely.

18:30.253 --> 18:34.381
l had one of those too.
Another world, a different time.

18:34.549 --> 18:37.040
Now l'm a very
happily married father.

18:37.219 --> 18:40.884
Two girls, two cats, a dog.

18:42.349 --> 18:44.970
Sandy, can we get
a drink over here?

18:45.144 --> 18:49.058
- Yes, sir, l'll send Jeannie over.
- Thanks.

18:50.108 --> 18:52.184
Talk about a piece of work.

18:53.153 --> 18:56.937
- You got a girlfriend?
- l'm working on it.

19:01.662 --> 19:05.410
Well, if it isn't my three favourite ladies
from tennis school.

19:05.583 --> 19:08.074
Hey, aquatic update. The party fish
are running again tonight.

19:08.252 --> 19:09.450
Yeah, so is Moby Dick.

19:09.629 --> 19:11.835
Come on, you're gonna miss
the thrill of a lifetime.

19:12.007 --> 19:14.758
Oh, l don't know about that.

19:18.180 --> 19:21.383
- Hi.
- Hello. Goodbye.

19:21.559 --> 19:23.847
- Wait a minute, where are you going?
- Home.

19:24.020 --> 19:26.392
- You live far?
- Not far.

19:26.564 --> 19:29.434
That's good, because l rented a limo
to take you anywhere you wanna go.

19:29.609 --> 19:31.317
You did what?

19:31.486 --> 19:33.562
Well, it's not exactly a limo,

19:33.738 --> 19:36.276
but it worked for Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.203
The sand is bad.

19:44.542 --> 19:48.290
No, oh, God! Oh, God!

19:49.130 --> 19:53.459
Living at the beach is definitely
the best part about living in L.A.

19:53.635 --> 19:56.755
Yeah, except you have to be
a multi-zillionaire to live near the water.

19:57.639 --> 20:00.924
That's all right, l plan on making
my first zillion by the end of the week.

20:01.143 --> 20:03.812
- Do you?
- Yeah.

20:04.021 --> 20:07.520
l'm starting a new conglomerate.
Cabana Boys R Us.

20:07.734 --> 20:09.773
lt'll be a franchise operation.

20:09.986 --> 20:11.361
l'll be the chairman of the board,

20:11.529 --> 20:14.316
and you can be the executive director
of everything else.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.073
Promises, promises.

20:17.244 --> 20:21.076
Oh, come on, we'll get Jerry Rattinger
to bankroll the whole operation.

20:21.290 --> 20:23.911
Put our corporate offices
wherever in the world we want.

20:24.126 --> 20:26.831
Hawaii, Aspen, Prague.

20:27.046 --> 20:29.169
At the rate l'm going,
it'll probably be Kuwait.

20:33.845 --> 20:34.924
Are you okay?

20:35.764 --> 20:38.765
Yeah. No.

20:39.351 --> 20:41.260
l don't know.

20:41.937 --> 20:46.065
Just listening to you talk,
l realise l'll never have a beach house,

20:46.234 --> 20:49.484
or any of the other things l used to
dream about when l was your age.

20:49.696 --> 20:52.531
What are you talking about?
You're still young.

20:53.075 --> 20:55.482
Getting older by the minute.

20:56.537 --> 20:58.695
l wish l would have met you
five years ago.

20:59.498 --> 21:02.368
You wouldn't have liked me
five years ago.

21:02.752 --> 21:05.706
- l was in sixth grade.
- l gotta go.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.165
Oh, hey, come on, don't you want
to wait for the grunion to come?

21:10.802 --> 21:12.260
How old are you?

21:28.655 --> 21:31.027
You know, l'm really glad
l took this job now.

21:31.199 --> 21:32.444
l got the beach, l got the sun.

21:32.618 --> 21:34.776
l got the beautiful chick
on the front of my bike.

21:34.953 --> 21:39.164
Stop it, Brandon,
you're embarrassing me.

21:52.806 --> 21:56.554
- Surf kumby, you coming or going?
- A little of both.

21:56.727 --> 22:00.096
Look, the other day, when you were
talking to me about Sandy,

22:00.273 --> 22:03.393
you didn't tell me you were
gonna make a move in that direction.

22:03.568 --> 22:04.813
You think she's too old for me?

22:05.028 --> 22:09.820
No, man, age is not the issue. She's
just not the right person for you at all.

22:09.991 --> 22:11.105
So, what are you saying?

22:12.452 --> 22:15.536
l'd rather not get into specifics, man,
but you gotta trust me on this one.

22:15.706 --> 22:18.161
All right? Before you get in
over your head.

22:20.127 --> 22:22.119
ls this your way of telling me
you slept with her?

22:22.338 --> 22:25.422
This is my way of telling you to go
in this thing with your eyes open, man.

22:25.592 --> 22:27.584
Or somebody's bound to get hurt.

22:28.803 --> 22:30.427
lt's too bad
you didn't tell Brenda that

22:30.597 --> 22:33.004
before you got her
to hop into bed with you.

22:34.351 --> 22:36.889
Consider yourself warned.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.432
You broke her heart,
you know that, don't you?

22:40.608 --> 22:43.692
No, Jones,
l think you got that flipped around.

22:43.861 --> 22:45.818
Bigtime.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.495
- Hey, Henry. Have you seen Sandy?
- Probably went to pick up her cheque.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.490
- Cool, thanks.
- Yeah.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.375
Sandy, l've been looking
all over for you.

22:58.544 --> 23:02.079
Brandon, listen, l'm sorry,
l can't make it tonight.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.173
- Something's come up, okay?
- Sandy.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.220
l'll make it up to you. l promise.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.139
Brandon.

23:12.768 --> 23:14.392
l've been thinking about
your new car.

23:16.105 --> 23:17.563
What new car?

23:19.150 --> 23:21.605
Jerry Rattinger
is offering to buy you a what?

23:21.819 --> 23:23.443
He's not buying me anything, Dad.

23:23.613 --> 23:25.356
He's giving me an advance
against my salary.

23:25.573 --> 23:28.490
- Salary for what?
- For working.

23:28.660 --> 23:31.495
- Doing what?
- Well, this summer, l'll be like a gofer.

23:31.663 --> 23:34.332
When school starts up, he says
l can work in his publicity office

23:34.500 --> 23:36.326
as a trainee,
tied in with the school paper.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.909
- What about the Beach Club?
- Henry's gotta understand.

23:39.130 --> 23:40.754
Rattinger's paying me
double my salary.

23:40.923 --> 23:44.043
No matter how many hours l work,
even days when he doesn't need me.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.548
- lt's a win-win deal.
- Why is it win?

23:46.763 --> 23:48.636
Why is he willing to pay you
for doing nothing?

23:49.308 --> 23:51.265
He thinks l'm a good
paddle-tennis prospect?

23:51.477 --> 23:54.394
- This is serious, Brandon.
- l don't know, Dad.

23:54.563 --> 23:55.973
You know what he's like.

23:56.148 --> 23:58.555
He has a different philosophy
than you.

23:58.734 --> 24:00.014
l think he feels sorry for me

24:00.194 --> 24:03.029
because he knows there's no life
for a teenager in L.A. without a car.

24:03.531 --> 24:06.900
And you know, even though
he has two beautiful little girls,

24:07.119 --> 24:09.407
l think deep down inside
he really wants a son.

24:10.789 --> 24:13.743
l do too. l just didn't know
he'd go after mine.

24:24.054 --> 24:26.889
You know, Rattinger said Dad
might try to torpedo the whole deal,

24:27.057 --> 24:28.302
and l said, ''No way.''

24:28.475 --> 24:30.633
l mean, why would he care,
just so long as l'm working

24:30.811 --> 24:33.646
to pay back the loan on the car?
And then this morning it hit me.

24:33.814 --> 24:37.313
lt hit me like a diamond bullet.
He doesn't want me to have a car.

24:37.485 --> 24:40.486
Any car. Because he's still
punishing me for totalling Mondale.

24:40.655 --> 24:41.900
Oh, Brandon, l don't know.

24:42.073 --> 24:44.065
l mean, Dad stood by you
through traffic court.

24:44.242 --> 24:45.273
He knows you don't drink.

24:45.452 --> 24:47.777
Then why is he so down on me
going to work for Rattinger?

24:47.955 --> 24:49.283
l think that's fairly obvious.

24:49.456 --> 24:51.247
Yeah, the size of Rattinger's
bank account.

24:51.417 --> 24:54.453
No way! Dad's worked
with plenty of rich people before.

24:54.628 --> 24:56.336
He just doesn't understand
why this man

24:56.505 --> 24:58.663
is offering to pay you
good money for the summer

24:58.841 --> 25:02.589
to do practically nothing.
And to be truthful, l agree.

25:02.929 --> 25:04.339
You're as bad as he is.

25:04.514 --> 25:06.138
What can l say? We are related.

25:06.308 --> 25:07.968
You know,
if it's bothering you that much,

25:08.143 --> 25:09.934
why don't you talk to him about it?

25:11.605 --> 25:14.725
- Can l ask you one more question?
- Sure.

25:15.526 --> 25:17.851
Why are you wearing a winter coat
in the middle of July?

25:19.864 --> 25:21.322
You don't wanna know.

25:25.245 --> 25:28.744
- Morning, Mom.
- Oh, hi, honey. l'll be in in a sec.

25:28.916 --> 25:30.742
Oh, no. No rush.

25:31.460 --> 25:34.247
Listen, just between you,
me and your flowers,

25:34.422 --> 25:36.747
is Dad in a better mood
this morning?

25:36.924 --> 25:37.955
l think so,

25:38.134 --> 25:41.337
but unfortunately, he had to leave early
for an audit down in San Diego.

25:41.513 --> 25:42.627
He's not here?

25:42.806 --> 25:45.641
No, but he said that whatever
you decide with Mr. Rattinger

25:45.809 --> 25:48.134
is fine with him, and he'll talk
to you when he gets home.

25:48.312 --> 25:49.343
But l have the late shift.

25:49.521 --> 25:52.771
By the time l get home, he'll be in--
God, this is so typical of him.

25:52.942 --> 25:55.314
He lays this guilt on me about
not wanting to work so hard

25:55.486 --> 25:57.478
and he's too busy working
to talk to me about it.

25:57.655 --> 26:00.609
- Honey, l know you're upset.
- No, l'm not upset, Mom.

26:00.784 --> 26:03.275
l just wish he could find the time
to deal with me for once.

26:03.453 --> 26:07.533
- Well, can't it keep for one night?
- l guess it'll have to.

26:11.003 --> 26:14.039
Listen, the last thing l wanted to do
is get between you and your old man--

26:14.215 --> 26:16.207
- l know.
- lt sounded like a perfect fit.

26:16.384 --> 26:19.587
l mean, l needed someone
to run a few errands for me.

26:19.763 --> 26:21.554
You needed a car.

26:22.307 --> 26:24.632
But, hey, if he's gonna get
his nose out of joint,

26:24.810 --> 26:26.185
smart thing would be to forget it.

26:27.354 --> 26:29.014
The problem is,
l don't wanna forget it.

26:29.231 --> 26:30.891
Well, then be your own man.

26:31.609 --> 26:34.479
Eventually, every kid
comes to a fork in the road,

26:34.695 --> 26:38.313
and no matter which way you go,
it's gotta be your own decision.

26:40.035 --> 26:42.989
Well, my dad did say
whatever l chose would be cool.

26:45.374 --> 26:46.916
A Mustang convertible, right?

26:49.336 --> 26:51.578
Why don't we just cruise down
to the volleyball court

26:51.756 --> 26:53.795
and see what we can do.

26:55.385 --> 26:57.377
Hey, we feeling any better today?

26:57.554 --> 27:01.468
Actually, we're feeling a lot worse,
so consider yourself warned.

27:01.641 --> 27:03.717
Did l do something?

27:04.144 --> 27:06.682
lt's not about you, Brandon.
lt's about me.

27:06.855 --> 27:09.476
- Well, do you want to talk about it?
- Talk about what?

27:09.692 --> 27:11.234
Why there isn't enough time
in the day?

27:11.402 --> 27:14.937
Why there isn't enough money in
the bank? Why my head is pounding?

27:15.156 --> 27:19.865
Look, Brandon,
you're a very sweet boy,

27:20.078 --> 27:23.411
but l'm going through some really
heavy personal stuff right now.

27:23.582 --> 27:28.208
l'm just not about to pour my heart out
to a teenager from Beverly Hills.

27:31.257 --> 27:33.748
Mommy? Mommy?

27:33.926 --> 27:36.843
Mommy? Mommy?

27:37.013 --> 27:41.722
Where is Mommy?
Mom? Mommy? Where is Mommy?

27:41.893 --> 27:44.348
- Brenda?
- Dad?

27:44.771 --> 27:45.802
What are you doing?

27:47.274 --> 27:50.477
l don't know, but whatever l'm doing,
it's not working for me,

27:50.653 --> 27:52.195
and now
l'm just crying out of control,

27:52.363 --> 27:54.320
and l still can't get in touch
with my emotions.

27:54.490 --> 27:58.238
Are you still working on that day
that you were lost at Dayton's?

28:05.961 --> 28:09.164
- That was some scary day.
- Yeah, l know all about it.

28:09.340 --> 28:10.668
Mom went to the linen department.

28:10.841 --> 28:13.711
You went upstairs to sporting goods
to buy a bowling ball,

28:14.304 --> 28:15.881
and l was supposed
to stay with Brandon,

28:16.055 --> 28:17.964
but l started riding up and down
the escalators,

28:18.141 --> 28:20.014
and that's when l got into trouble.

28:20.185 --> 28:23.554
- You were so cute.
- Cute?

28:25.065 --> 28:27.556
You and Mom always told me
that l was hysterical.

28:28.152 --> 28:29.527
Well, that was after you got lost.

28:29.862 --> 28:31.439
When you were playing
on the escalators,

28:31.614 --> 28:33.487
you were having the time of your life.

28:37.954 --> 28:42.034
That is Maia Landen.
She's young, but she's kind of cute.

28:42.751 --> 28:44.542
She's real young.

28:44.962 --> 28:47.500
- Yeah, she is kind of--
- How young is she, Steve?

28:47.673 --> 28:49.582
- Fourteen? Fifteen?
- She's young.

28:49.759 --> 28:53.258
But she's very mature for her age.
l haven't made a move on her.

28:53.429 --> 28:55.302
What about you and Sandy?

28:55.682 --> 28:57.888
Our relationship
is kind of like the grunion.

28:58.059 --> 29:00.894
No one knows if it really exists.

29:01.063 --> 29:03.102
Walsh, Mr. Rattinger needs
some extra manpower

29:03.273 --> 29:04.553
out in the parking lot, okay?

29:04.733 --> 29:06.191
Yeah, sure. Come on, man.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.984
- Give me a hand.
- Sure.

29:13.284 --> 29:15.572
- Brandon.
- Hey, Mr. Rattinger.

29:15.745 --> 29:18.995
l brought my partner in crime along
in case it was a two-man job.

29:19.166 --> 29:22.451
No, l think you'll be able to
handle this yourself.

29:22.836 --> 29:25.124
- Nice car.
- Yeah, new.

29:25.339 --> 29:27.047
You need me to carry
something up for you?

29:27.216 --> 29:29.967
No, l need you
to get behind the wheel

29:30.178 --> 29:32.336
to see if this is something
you wouldn't mind driving

29:32.555 --> 29:33.965
for the rest of the summer.

29:38.854 --> 29:40.562
You said you needed a car.

29:40.772 --> 29:43.523
Yeah, but a used Mustang, not a...

29:43.692 --> 29:45.815
We can probably still get you
your Mustang,

29:46.028 --> 29:47.854
but this way,
my corporation can lease this,

29:48.072 --> 29:49.815
and l can deduct the interest.

29:50.032 --> 29:51.692
This is an incredible piece
of machinery.

29:51.868 --> 29:53.777
Here, take it for a spin up the coast.

29:53.953 --> 29:56.159
Let me know how it handles.

29:56.331 --> 29:59.166
Well, Mr. Rattinger,
l don't know what to say. lt's great.

29:59.334 --> 30:01.825
Well, how about trying,
''Thanks a lot, Jer.''

30:02.004 --> 30:03.747
Hey, Jer, if l said ''thanks a lot,''

30:03.922 --> 30:05.795
you think l could sport
one of these bad boys?

30:05.966 --> 30:08.967
l thought you had a chauffeur.
Listen, remember, buckle up.

30:09.136 --> 30:10.844
Always.

30:12.724 --> 30:14.384
Damn it.

30:15.435 --> 30:17.308
Hey, is something wrong?

30:20.023 --> 30:23.024
l hate to ask you to do this, but...

30:23.777 --> 30:26.482
- Could you excuse us for a second?
- Sure.

30:29.075 --> 30:30.818
Listen...

30:32.120 --> 30:33.863
Mrs. Rattinger
had a little too much sun

30:34.039 --> 30:35.319
with her wine this afternoon.

30:35.498 --> 30:37.289
She's gonna need a lift
back into town.

30:37.501 --> 30:40.252
Normally, l'd do it myself,
but l have to stay here,

30:40.420 --> 30:41.795
tie up a couple of loose ends.

30:42.005 --> 30:44.377
Yeah, no problem, Jerry.

30:44.550 --> 30:46.044
Thanks.

30:57.731 --> 31:01.182
l'm sorry l can't put the top up.
l haven't figured out how to do it yet.

31:01.402 --> 31:03.857
But l'll turn up the heat. How's that?

31:05.656 --> 31:07.814
When did you start working
for my husband?

31:08.034 --> 31:10.157
About 1 5 minutes ago.

31:10.370 --> 31:12.576
What do you think of him so far?

31:12.747 --> 31:14.573
Your husband's a great guy.

31:15.333 --> 31:18.168
You don't have to put on an act
with me, Brandon.

31:18.378 --> 31:21.165
l'm sorry, Mrs. Rattinger, l have
no idea what you're talking about.

31:21.382 --> 31:23.505
l'm talking about my husband.

31:23.717 --> 31:26.634
l'm talking about his mistress.

31:26.804 --> 31:28.962
You're not the first
pretty boy he's hired

31:29.182 --> 31:32.432
to drive me home from the Beach Club
so he can be with his playthings.

31:35.230 --> 31:37.602
Hear he's trying to get back
with Sandy.

31:38.442 --> 31:40.518
ls it true?

31:42.071 --> 31:44.822
l can't see it.

31:48.035 --> 31:50.193
You work with Sandy,
don't you, Brandon?

31:51.331 --> 31:52.908
Yeah.

32:09.475 --> 32:12.641
Since you're going up to his cabana,
could you take him back his car keys?

32:12.812 --> 32:14.187
Tell him thanks, but no, thanks,

32:14.397 --> 32:15.974
which is all l've gotta say
to you too.

32:16.149 --> 32:17.857
lt's not what you think, Brandon.

32:18.026 --> 32:20.102
lt's not some cheap, sordid affair.

32:20.321 --> 32:21.863
How do you know
what l think, Sandy?

32:22.031 --> 32:24.700
You don't know me,
and l obviously don't know you.

32:24.909 --> 32:26.985
That's right. You don't know me.

32:27.161 --> 32:28.904
You don't know anything about me.

32:29.289 --> 32:30.617
You don't know what l go through

32:30.790 --> 32:32.829
to get up in the morning
and look in the mirror,

32:33.001 --> 32:35.159
so don't you sit in judgement of me.

32:35.337 --> 32:37.625
Especially when Mommy and Daddy
still pay your bills.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.583
Oh, no, this isn't about my mommy
and daddy.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.587
lt's about you
and your sugar daddy.

32:42.762 --> 32:44.256
You better run along up to him,

32:44.430 --> 32:46.718
since he's the one
who pays all your bills.

33:33.316 --> 33:34.976
Brandon.

33:35.444 --> 33:37.021
Glad you're home.

33:38.072 --> 33:39.981
l was fading.

33:41.450 --> 33:43.110
How you doing?

33:43.286 --> 33:44.661
l don't know.

33:44.829 --> 33:47.035
There's pretty weird stuff
going on at work.

33:47.540 --> 33:50.209
Well, hopefully,
what l have to say to you

33:50.377 --> 33:53.627
will put your mind at ease
about all that.

33:54.756 --> 33:56.629
This morning, on the train down
to San Diego,

33:56.800 --> 34:02.387
l had a lot of time to think
about car loans and work ethics

34:02.890 --> 34:05.215
and the age-old tug of war
between fathers and sons.

34:05.393 --> 34:06.768
- Dad--
- Please.

34:06.936 --> 34:09.509
Let me just get this
off my chest first.

34:10.315 --> 34:14.728
You know, it's one thing for a father

34:14.902 --> 34:18.817
to try to instil a sense
of positive values in his children,

34:18.991 --> 34:23.036
you know, ''You get
what you pay for'' or whatever.

34:23.579 --> 34:28.870
And it's quite another thing
when a father hides his own frustration

34:29.043 --> 34:32.543
behind a guise of wisdom
and experience.

34:34.049 --> 34:35.672
l don't follow you.

34:35.884 --> 34:36.915
The other morning,

34:37.094 --> 34:39.844
when you asked if the reason
we didn't wanna join the Beach Club

34:40.014 --> 34:42.884
was because it was a money thing,

34:43.059 --> 34:48.646
l managed to change the subject
and run for the high moral ground.

34:49.315 --> 34:53.645
But the truth is...

34:55.280 --> 34:58.530
...yes, it is a money thing.

34:58.742 --> 35:01.659
lt's something
l've been struggling with

35:01.871 --> 35:06.284
since l turned down the promotion
to move us back to Minnesota.

35:06.501 --> 35:09.952
- Dad--
- l know. l'm sorry, l'm rambling.

35:10.464 --> 35:13.334
The bottom line is
there's no earthly reason for you

35:13.509 --> 35:15.548
to be knocking yourself out
folding beach chairs,

35:15.719 --> 35:17.711
when you could be having
the summer of your life.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.552
So do yourself a favour, son.

35:21.225 --> 35:23.301
Forget about
your old man's hang-ups.

35:23.519 --> 35:26.685
Go work for Rattinger,
find out how the other half lives.

35:28.066 --> 35:29.857
l already did.

35:30.861 --> 35:33.268
lt's not all it's cracked up to be.

35:33.447 --> 35:36.697
There's just one more thing
l wanna say to you.

35:36.867 --> 35:42.870
lt's what my father said to me
on the morning l left for university.

35:43.583 --> 35:45.243
He said:

35:47.087 --> 35:49.079
''Don't sell yourself short.''

35:49.965 --> 35:52.290
Be your own man, Brandon.

35:53.177 --> 35:55.003
Everything else will fall into place.

36:09.736 --> 36:14.398
Well, if it isn't the king
of the cabana boys.

36:17.119 --> 36:18.992
l was wondering if we were
gonna see you today.

36:19.205 --> 36:21.281
Yeah, l was wondering
the same thing.

36:21.499 --> 36:23.538
My father said
l should honour my commitments.

36:23.751 --> 36:25.993
Good for Jim.
Your father is a very honourable man.

36:27.047 --> 36:29.964
Mr. Rattinger, anything
you have to say to my father,

36:30.175 --> 36:32.381
l suggest you say it to him
and not to me.

36:32.594 --> 36:35.345
Did he tell you to say that,
or did you think it up all by yourself?

36:36.515 --> 36:37.795
Thank you.

36:37.975 --> 36:40.430
They tell me the car that you drove
last night really excels

36:40.603 --> 36:42.394
at handling the bumps,
taking the curves.

36:42.564 --> 36:44.521
l wish the same could be said
of the driver.

36:44.691 --> 36:46.564
Yeah, it was an all-right car.

36:46.735 --> 36:48.526
lt's no '65 Mustang.

36:49.738 --> 36:52.774
lt got very ugly last night.

36:53.409 --> 36:56.196
Very embarrassing,
very unnecessary.

37:00.416 --> 37:02.325
l really could have
taught you something.

37:02.502 --> 37:05.787
Like what? Like how to hurt people?

37:05.964 --> 37:09.249
- Deceive them, intimidate them?
- Brandon, Brandon.

37:09.468 --> 37:12.173
Sandy's a nervous wreck,
Mr. Rattinger.

37:12.346 --> 37:13.804
She's a wreck because of you.

37:18.477 --> 37:21.182
As far as Sandy is concerned,

37:21.356 --> 37:25.603
my conscience is crystal clear.

37:26.278 --> 37:28.104
As far as we're concerned,

37:28.322 --> 37:30.314
l think Henry Thomas
is looking for you.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.241
Good luck in your next job, kid.

37:54.475 --> 37:57.595
- Henry?
- Hey, Brando.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.228
lf it weren't for these VCRs,

37:59.397 --> 38:02.066
l might not ever be able
to catch up with my programmes.

38:02.233 --> 38:04.605
Mr. Rattinger said
you wanted to see me.

38:04.778 --> 38:05.809
Sure, yeah.

38:05.987 --> 38:08.560
- Let me tell you what's happening.
- Am l fired?

38:12.828 --> 38:15.615
- Now, what was the question?
- Damn it, Henry.

38:15.790 --> 38:18.032
What is this
''Damn it, Henry'' business?

38:18.209 --> 38:21.827
Rattinger ordered me to fire you.
l told him l would consider it.

38:22.005 --> 38:25.290
lt's been considered.
lt's been rejected.

38:27.302 --> 38:29.840
lf he don't like it, let him try
and run this place without me

38:30.013 --> 38:31.175
in the middle of July.

38:33.058 --> 38:34.433
Thanks.

38:34.602 --> 38:36.179
Not that you're any good
at what you do.

38:36.354 --> 38:38.180
l don't want you
to get the wrong impression.

38:38.398 --> 38:40.936
Not everything around here
is bought and paid for.

38:44.696 --> 38:46.688
What about Sandy?

38:48.826 --> 38:50.450
She quit.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.369
Yeah, l figured as much.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.826
You think she's got troubles?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.873
You ever watch
The Young and the Restless?

38:58.044 --> 39:00.914
- No.
- What?

39:01.089 --> 39:02.547
Come here.

39:04.885 --> 39:08.883
That's Julia, right? Julia's having
a baby by her husband's father.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.550
- My father?
- Yes.

39:10.766 --> 39:13.304
The whole week
l was sobbing my guts out,

39:13.477 --> 39:15.849
and there's my dad
under the archway going,

39:16.022 --> 39:18.477
''Honey, what are you doing?''

39:20.110 --> 39:22.683
But the funny thing is,
my dad started reminiscing,

39:22.863 --> 39:25.614
and it's like something just clicked.

39:25.782 --> 39:29.317
l'd been trying to feel something
that l had never really felt.

39:29.495 --> 39:32.365
l mean, it wasn't about the coat
anymore, or the memory of me,

39:32.540 --> 39:35.956
or what anybody was trying to tell me
that l was feeling at the time.

39:36.127 --> 39:37.158
lt's about me.

39:37.337 --> 39:40.836
Being back on those escalators
having a great time, all by myself.

39:41.049 --> 39:43.622
Sounds like a breakthrough to me.
Nice work, Brenda.

39:43.802 --> 39:48.263
Well, the best part is, l wasn't afraid
to be by myself back then.

39:48.432 --> 39:51.967
Six years old in a department store
full of strangers.

39:52.144 --> 39:55.228
There's no reason in the world
why it shouldn't be like that today.

39:55.398 --> 39:57.224
Way to go, Brenda.

39:59.110 --> 40:00.485
Let's go to the beach.

40:00.695 --> 40:03.482
- Get it in there, put it in there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:03.657 --> 40:05.400
Set him up.

40:06.118 --> 40:08.194
Slam it, slam it.
Slam it for the point.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.657
- Out.
- Are you crazy?

40:11.874 --> 40:14.791
- That was in by a country mile.
- l'm not giving you the point, Jerry.

40:15.002 --> 40:17.707
- Not going to argue with you about it.
- Did you see it, Brandon?

40:18.339 --> 40:20.212
- Yeah, l saw it.
- What was it?

40:20.383 --> 40:22.541
Wait, all right, listen,
we'll just take it over.

40:22.761 --> 40:24.041
What for? Brandon saw it.

40:24.262 --> 40:26.135
So, what's the call, Brandon?

40:31.937 --> 40:33.431
lt was in.

40:33.648 --> 40:38.025
Like l said, l call them
like l see them, Jerry.

40:43.492 --> 40:44.820
Right, okay, let's go.

40:48.873 --> 40:51.328
You're gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

40:51.500 --> 40:53.373
Hi, Brandon.

40:53.669 --> 40:58.295
- You're moving out?
- Yeah, l'm leaving town.

40:58.466 --> 41:01.751
My mom and my sister
have a place up in San Luis Obispo,

41:01.928 --> 41:04.216
and they've been asking me
to stay with them.

41:05.015 --> 41:08.099
Clearly it's not
working here anymore.

41:11.814 --> 41:13.189
He told me he loved me.

41:14.984 --> 41:17.735
He said he'd leave
his wife and children.

41:19.239 --> 41:20.270
That was two years ago.

41:22.993 --> 41:24.024
l'm sorry.

41:24.536 --> 41:29.114
Being with you though,
listening to your approach to things...

41:29.667 --> 41:32.621
...it's really helped me to see
how jaded and angry l've become.

41:34.047 --> 41:35.838
Thank you.

41:46.018 --> 41:47.726
Say goodbye to Dylan for me,
will you?

41:47.937 --> 41:49.514
Yeah.

41:59.449 --> 42:02.699
- Drive safely, now, you hear?
- l will.

42:03.287 --> 42:04.829
Bye.

42:16.384 --> 42:19.135
Yo, kumby,
can l buy you some lemonade?

42:20.305 --> 42:21.847
Tell you what,

42:22.015 --> 42:27.804
throw in a little chicken ranchero
and some salsa, you got a customer.

42:31.734 --> 42:34.059
l just feel so bad about Sandy.

42:34.237 --> 42:36.229
- Thanks, Grace.
- Thanks, Grace.

42:36.406 --> 42:41.115
Well, she's not bad news, man,
she's just unhappy.

42:41.286 --> 42:43.492
Or she wouldn't have got herself
into that situation

42:43.664 --> 42:45.206
with Rattinger to begin with.

42:45.374 --> 42:47.532
l really liked her, man.

42:47.710 --> 42:49.833
l know, l know.

42:50.004 --> 42:51.498
But you gotta
promise me something.

42:51.672 --> 42:52.952
What's that?

42:53.132 --> 42:57.841
The next time you ask me if l've been
with a girl that you have a crush on,

42:58.013 --> 42:59.804
l get a free one anywhere.

42:59.973 --> 43:02.464
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

43:02.643 --> 43:04.469
Just not the nose.

43:06.605 --> 43:10.768
- Females, what are you doing here?
- We were just in the neighbourhood.

43:11.277 --> 43:13.946
So this is the Beverly Hills
Beach Club, huh?

43:16.575 --> 43:18.033
Kelly, what's so funny?

43:18.869 --> 43:21.075
Poor Steve.

43:23.457 --> 43:25.248
What's up, buddy?

43:25.417 --> 43:27.374
lt's low. lt's lower than low.

43:27.545 --> 43:29.703
lt's the lowest common denominator.

43:29.922 --> 43:33.088
- What happened, man?
- You remember Maia Landen?

43:33.468 --> 43:37.003
- Fifteen-year-old vamp?
- Yes.

43:37.556 --> 43:39.347
She says she just wants
to be my friend,

43:39.975 --> 43:43.178
but what gets me is,
she's got the hots for--

43:43.354 --> 43:44.978
Hey, big guy.

43:46.273 --> 43:49.808
So, what time are the grunion
running tonight?

43:50.486 --> 43:52.277
What are grunion?

43:53.364 --> 43:55.356
You know, you'd think
they'd have enough courtesy

43:55.533 --> 43:57.442
to show up for their own party.

43:57.619 --> 44:01.486
Yeah, l guess they figured
it was a long swim back to Mexico.

44:01.707 --> 44:05.040
Yeah, well, the water is a lot warmer
in Puerto Vallarta.

44:05.211 --> 44:09.540
- The party's over!
- Oh, boy.

44:11.259 --> 44:13.964
Let's do that every year. Every year.

44:14.137 --> 44:15.168
Are we leaving?

44:15.347 --> 44:16.461
- lt's getting late.
- No.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.685
l came here to see some grunion,
l'm gonna see some grunion.

44:20.853 --> 44:23.308
- That's the spirit.
- Go.

44:24.231 --> 44:27.434
You know, your brother's a fool,
you know that?

44:27.610 --> 44:29.519
Yes, l know.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.985
You know, it's really nice
being here with you,

44:33.158 --> 44:35.909
but not being here with you,
you know?

44:36.077 --> 44:38.449
You mean like a good friend?

44:39.081 --> 44:41.369
Anything is possible.

44:43.169 --> 44:44.877
Anything?

44:46.380 --> 44:51.884
- lt's kind of disappointing, isn't it?
- No, it's kind of nice to see everybody.

44:52.053 --> 44:54.045
Guys, what does a grunion
look like anyway?

44:54.222 --> 44:56.095
l don't know.
l've never seen one before.

44:56.308 --> 44:59.059
Do they kind of look like a cross
between a sardine and an anchovy?

44:59.228 --> 45:00.888
Yeah, why?

45:02.273 --> 45:04.680
Grunion!
