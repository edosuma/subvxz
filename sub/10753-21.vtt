WEBVTT

00:08.514 --> 00:11.233
Oh, look, Roz, my brochures are here!

00:11.518 --> 00:14.316
Oh, God, very exciting! Vacation!

00:14.606 --> 00:19.316
The Golden Door Spa! Look at
those accommodations. That is nice!

00:19.699 --> 00:21.974
I'll leave Dad to fend for himself,

00:22.244 --> 00:25.554
while I spend an obscene amount
being pampered like a child.

00:25.876 --> 00:31.189
What else are vacations for?
What are you doing for your week off?

00:31.594 --> 00:33.903
Oh, I'm taking my mom
to Ireland to stay

00:34.181 --> 00:37.059
in the hovel
where her mother was born.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.353
Just write the words "bad son"
on my forehead!

00:44.865 --> 00:47.504
You deserve to pamper yourself.

00:47.787 --> 00:50.506
After all,
you do work three hours a day.

00:54.297 --> 00:57.926
I'm sorry, that one even surprised me.

00:58.262 --> 01:01.379
When I think of the relationship
I have with my dad,

01:01.684 --> 01:04.994
I envy the relationship
you have with your mother.

01:05.315 --> 01:09.103
It didn't just happen.
We work at it. We spend time together.

01:09.447 --> 01:13.235
Dad lives with me. How much more
time together could we spend?

01:13.579 --> 01:15.649
Day-to-day living is different.

01:15.916 --> 01:20.194
There is nothing better than taking a trip
together. You get to relax.

01:20.549 --> 01:22.858
You get to see a different side of him.

01:23.137 --> 01:26.573
In his entire life,
my dad has never been to Europe.

01:28.061 --> 01:31.451
It would be a way of connecting
with him if I gave him that.

01:31.776 --> 01:35.132
What would you charge me
to take him to Ireland with you?

01:38.662 --> 01:40.493
(Moaning)

01:44.589 --> 01:48.138
I should have known this would happen.
I always throw out my back

01:48.470 --> 01:50.745
when I try to lift Maris's luggage.

01:51.016 --> 01:53.974
- Why didn't you hire a skycap?
- We did for most of it.

01:54.271 --> 01:57.229
She won't trust strangers
with her make-up case,

01:57.526 --> 01:59.482
ever since a porter dropped it

01:59.739 --> 02:03.414
and broke three vials
of rare Swiss lamb placenta.

02:05.331 --> 02:09.722
On the up side, the calfskin lining
was never more soft and supple.

02:12.468 --> 02:14.424
Where did Mrs Crane go?

02:14.679 --> 02:17.068
(Groaning)

02:19.438 --> 02:22.510
She's making her annual pilgrimage
to the holy land.

02:22.819 --> 02:25.049
Thought she was in Dallas,
at her sister's.

02:25.322 --> 02:27.677
That is her holy land.

02:27.952 --> 02:30.261
The site of the first Nieman Marcus.

02:32.251 --> 02:34.003
(Niles groans)

02:34.254 --> 02:37.371
- Oh, Dr Crane!
- Oh, call me Niles!

02:44.312 --> 02:46.780
Thank you, Daphne.

02:47.067 --> 02:51.185
Dad, I have a really exciting idea.
I want to take you on vacation!

02:52.951 --> 02:56.182
- Why?
- I thought an adventure

02:56.499 --> 02:58.649
might give us a chance to have fun,

02:58.919 --> 03:01.433
get reacquainted,
even do a little bonding.

03:01.716 --> 03:04.674
- What did you have in mind?
- It's not about where I want to go.

03:04.971 --> 03:08.168
It's about where YOU want to go.

03:08.477 --> 03:11.867
Dad, I give you...
the world.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.319
The Gallie-pagos Islands, huh?

03:19.704 --> 03:24.903
Where iguanas, sea lions and
giant tortoises live in eternal harmony.

03:25.296 --> 03:27.491
Is it important they get along?

03:28.886 --> 03:31.081
No, I suppose not.

03:31.348 --> 03:36.342
Oh, how about this? India and Nepal!
"Trek the foothills of the Himalayas."

03:36.732 --> 03:38.927
- You're forgetting my old pal.
- No problem.

03:39.194 --> 03:42.311
Frasier can hire a Sherpa
to carry you on his back.

03:43.743 --> 03:46.132
They don't mind.

03:46.414 --> 03:49.531
We haven't struck
the right chord yet, but we will.

03:49.837 --> 03:53.716
- You suggest something.
- You really want to go with me?

03:54.052 --> 03:56.407
Yes, I do.
I'll go anywhere you want to!

03:56.682 --> 04:01.517
- OK!
- I may not be as sophisticated as you,

04:01.898 --> 04:04.014
but I'd like to see America first.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.314
Great! We'll see America!

04:06.573 --> 04:10.009
- And I want to see it in a Winnebago.
- A Winnebago!

04:10.329 --> 04:16.199
- That has a real ring to it!
- Your mother and I dreamed about it.

04:16.630 --> 04:19.464
Then that is the trip we're going to take.

04:19.761 --> 04:21.911
- You really mean it?
- Absolutely.

04:22.182 --> 04:25.857
- This calls for a celebration.
- Let's pop open a couple of beers.

04:26.189 --> 04:29.261
I think I got a bag
of pork rinds in here, too.

04:29.569 --> 04:34.438
Ah, the final touch! I almost feel
like I'm in a trailer park already!

04:41.214 --> 04:43.523
Oh, Winnebago boy!

04:45.261 --> 04:48.458
Hang beach chairs on the back,
and give it a name like

04:48.768 --> 04:51.123
"The Whoopin' Cranes"!

04:52.607 --> 04:55.280
When I agreed
to see America with Dad,

04:55.570 --> 04:57.561
I thought it'd be five-star resorts.

04:57.823 --> 05:00.542
By "together" I meant adjoining suites!

05:00.828 --> 05:03.103
- Tell him it's a bad idea.
- I can't.

05:03.375 --> 05:06.287
He counts on it.
He was going to go with Mom.

05:06.588 --> 05:08.783
Yes, but she lucked out and died!

05:13.767 --> 05:15.723
Niles, listen.

05:15.979 --> 05:19.938
If Dad and I get into a Winnebago,
only one of us will come out alive.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.746
- You've got to come too.
- You're my brother.

05:23.032 --> 05:27.184
You're entitled to my bone marrow
and a kidney, but this is an imposition.

05:28.792 --> 05:33.024
You got to come with us.
Frasier and I have nothing to talk about.

05:33.383 --> 05:37.058
I feel more comfortable
with somebody else around.

05:37.389 --> 05:40.699
- Why did you suggest it?
- It sounded good when I said it.

05:41.021 --> 05:44.980
But thinking about it... Can you see
me and Frasier together all day,

05:45.319 --> 05:50.234
then crawling into bunks at night,
lying head to head in the dark, bonding?

05:51.788 --> 05:54.256
I'll pay you. I got pension money.

05:54.542 --> 05:59.332
I remember a car trip when I was nine.
We drove from Seattle to Spokane.

05:59.718 --> 06:01.470
All he said to me was,

06:01.721 --> 06:05.077
"l think we got a problem
with your brother Frasier."

06:12.530 --> 06:15.169
Those were awful,
those driving vacations.

06:15.452 --> 06:18.524
Dad insisting on covering
as many miles as possible,

06:18.832 --> 06:22.188
the two of us
tiny hostages in the back seat,

06:22.505 --> 06:24.894
clutching our car-sickness bags,

06:25.176 --> 06:28.168
straining to see something
as the landscape whizzed by.

06:28.473 --> 06:31.545
I was 13 before I realised
cows aren't blurry.

06:35.110 --> 06:40.389
- Just tell him you don't want to go.
- I don't want to disappoint him.

06:40.785 --> 06:43.253
I don't want to disappoint him.

06:43.540 --> 06:46.771
I'm sorry, Frasier.
I am not a Winnebago person.

06:47.087 --> 06:50.045
When I see one,
I look into the driver's eyes,

06:50.343 --> 06:55.212
hoping to see something that explains
why in God's name he wants to do this.

06:55.602 --> 06:59.390
All I see is a death stare
under a hat made of Miller Lite cans.

07:01.403 --> 07:04.440
This is my final word:
I'm not going.

07:04.742 --> 07:08.621
- Daphne's coming too!
- And so am l!

07:16.135 --> 07:18.524
(Dad)
It's everything I hoped, only better!

07:18.806 --> 07:21.161
It's like sitting in your lounge,
watching TV,

07:21.436 --> 07:23.996
except it isn't TV, it's America!

07:24.274 --> 07:27.789
Yes, Dad, it's the ultimate
in reality programming -

07:28.113 --> 07:29.944
actual reality.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.476
We got a turn-off in five miles,
so start slowing down.

07:33.831 --> 07:36.789
- I know.
- How does it feel behind that wheel?

07:37.963 --> 07:39.874
Manly.

07:40.884 --> 07:43.398
This is mine and it's big!

07:43.681 --> 07:45.876
(Toilet flushes)

07:46.143 --> 07:50.773
God, it's like being sealed upright
in a Formica coffin!

07:51.151 --> 07:55.667
When they were kids, all they had
in the back seat was a mayonnaise jar.

07:57.912 --> 07:59.868
Yes. It took quite a bit of skill

08:00.125 --> 08:03.754
to use it successfully
at 70 miles an hour.

08:04.089 --> 08:06.683
Never been fond of mayonnaise since.

08:06.969 --> 08:09.119
Or speed bumps.

08:09.390 --> 08:12.905
Turn-off's coming up in four miles.
Get ready.

08:13.229 --> 08:16.221
You're OK on the right.
It's never too early to move over.

08:16.527 --> 08:20.156
Dad, I was wondering
what inspired you to choose

08:20.491 --> 08:24.086
that uniquely American
man-made wonder, Mount Rushmore?

08:24.415 --> 08:26.975
It's obvious. We got a week off, right?

08:27.252 --> 08:29.641
That's as far as we can go in 3Â½ days.

08:29.923 --> 08:34.394
We get there, get out,
walk around, drive back. Boom!

08:34.765 --> 08:37.881
Another fine landmark under our belts.

08:38.188 --> 08:40.577
You've certainly got this well planned.

08:40.857 --> 08:44.407
When I take a holiday,
I just grab a change of knickers

08:44.740 --> 08:47.573
and see where the wind takes me.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.096
Niles.
Niles!

08:53.000 --> 08:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:03.562 --> 09:07.350
What Daphne's saying
is what we should really be doing.

09:07.695 --> 09:12.086
- What are you talking about?
- Why be so beholden to schedules?

09:12.452 --> 09:16.889
We Americans are enchanted
with the romance of the open highway.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.288
Jack Kerouac went "On The Road".

09:19.547 --> 09:21.902
Buzz and Todd
got their kicks on Route 66.

09:22.176 --> 09:25.452
The adventure is in the journey.
We should just ramble.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.759
Doggone it, I'm inspired!
I'm going to put on a baseball cap.

09:30.106 --> 09:32.574
- You'll miss the turn-off!
- So?

09:32.861 --> 09:35.819
- We'll get lost!
- We're in a house on wheels!

09:36.116 --> 09:39.950
- We're always home!
- It's coming up! Turn here!

09:40.290 --> 09:43.566
(Shouts)
This is it! Turn! Turn here!

09:43.879 --> 09:49.158
- We missed it!
- Dad, we didn't miss anything!

09:49.555 --> 09:51.671
Oh, my God!

09:55.356 --> 09:57.631
We're now on the road less travelled.

09:57.902 --> 10:01.861
From now on,
we dance to the rhythm of the road.

10:02.201 --> 10:06.638
There must be an access road
back onto that turn-off.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.355
Where is it? Where is it?

10:09.630 --> 10:12.383
Oh, it's always in the crack!

10:16.099 --> 10:18.249
So is life, Dad.

10:21.942 --> 10:25.378
I was anxious, but I'm starting
to like this free spirit stuff.

10:26.699 --> 10:30.453
Dad, there's an historical marker
up ahead. Let's stop.

10:30.790 --> 10:35.306
- Driving wherever you feel like it.
- It's educational. There! There!

10:35.673 --> 10:37.948
(Both)
There! There!

10:38.219 --> 10:40.175
- What did it say?
- No idea.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.184
The only word I saw was "legendary".

10:44.479 --> 10:48.074
Look, a roadside stand.
Fresh fruit, home-made cider!

10:48.402 --> 10:52.520
- (Both) Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Oh!

10:52.868 --> 10:56.543
You're missing
the freewheeling concept.

10:58.627 --> 11:01.425
We go where the wind blows us.

11:01.716 --> 11:05.152
It's blowing, we're going.
Why are you moaning?

11:05.472 --> 11:08.191
You're obsessed
with covering distance.

11:08.727 --> 11:12.766
- It's the way I relax.
Hey, watch it! I got my kids in the car!

11:13.819 --> 11:15.775
Whoa!

11:19.119 --> 11:22.236
Your "relaxing"
seems like an obsession.

11:22.541 --> 11:26.136
Don't you think so, Niles?
Niles, what are you doing?

11:26.465 --> 11:31.220
Making a vacation video we can look at
over and over and over again.

11:31.723 --> 11:35.921
OK. You guys want to stop so bad,
we'll stop. See that sign?

11:36.272 --> 11:40.265
"Have your picture taken
with a live grizzly. Souvenirs one mile."

11:40.613 --> 11:43.252
I always wanted
my picture taken with a bear.

11:43.535 --> 11:45.651
Some dreams cannot be denied.

11:45.914 --> 11:50.942
OK, Dad, you're good on my side.
It's never too early to change lane.

11:51.339 --> 11:54.251
Oh, my God! It must be genetic.

12:03.693 --> 12:06.969
Get your dog away from my bear.
I just had him cleaned.

12:07.282 --> 12:09.238
He's stuffed.

12:09.494 --> 12:13.646
- Your sign said a "live" bear.
- It's an old sign.

12:15.671 --> 12:18.185
Look at that view!
It's like we're really there!

12:18.467 --> 12:22.346
If we were,
we'd be whizzing by it at 50 mph.

12:22.682 --> 12:24.877
It's the gourmet food department.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.501
- Home-made deer jerky!
- "No sampling."

12:28.817 --> 12:33.208
- No problem.
- Would you take our picture, please?

12:33.576 --> 12:38.445
Niles, Frasier, come on up here.
OK. Here we go. Everybody ready?

12:38.834 --> 12:41.792
- Now, what should we do?
- How about this?

12:42.089 --> 12:44.319
That's great! I like that. OK, everybody.

12:44.594 --> 12:47.904
- Eddie!
- You know it's $10 Canadian.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.864
- For a treasured memory,
what's money?

12:51.146 --> 12:53.216
- OK. One...
- Why Canadian dollars?

12:53.483 --> 12:55.758
Because we're in Canada.

12:56.071 --> 12:57.629
(Screams)

12:58.867 --> 13:00.823
We're in Canada?

13:01.079 --> 13:04.469
We crossed the border a while ago.
You were taking a nap.

13:04.794 --> 13:08.548
But I can't be in Canada!
I'm not allowed to leave the States.

13:08.883 --> 13:12.080
- Why?
- I don't have me green card yet!

13:12.390 --> 13:17.180
Oh, this is just perfect!
Three months till me final interview.

13:17.565 --> 13:21.478
The one thing they told me
was not to leave the country.

13:21.822 --> 13:26.134
And the first time I fall asleep,
you drag me across the border!

13:26.496 --> 13:30.091
- They won't let me back in!
- They have to. It's not your fault.

13:30.419 --> 13:33.491
If only you hadn't been
so hell-bent on driving far!

13:33.800 --> 13:36.030
You had to go where the wind blows!

13:36.304 --> 13:38.260
(Heated argument)

13:42.063 --> 13:44.338
(Blows duck call)

13:44.610 --> 13:48.842
Never mind whose fault it is.
I'm stuck here. What am I going to do?

13:49.201 --> 13:52.876
We'll explain to the authorities.
I'm sure this happens all the time.

13:53.207 --> 13:56.279
- Get real. They got rules.
- Then what's your solution?

13:56.587 --> 13:59.784
- We'll sneak her across the border.
- That's called smuggling.

14:00.093 --> 14:02.084
Thanks, Niles!

14:02.347 --> 14:06.226
I knew it was something bad guys did.
I didn't know the technical term.

14:06.562 --> 14:10.191
You, a former policeman,
suggest we commit a felony?

14:10.526 --> 14:12.596
I've crossed this border plenty.

14:12.864 --> 14:16.823
Most of the time
the guards wave you through.

14:17.163 --> 14:19.802
- Let's get out of here.
- What if they pull us over?

14:20.085 --> 14:23.157
Daphne has to convince them
she's American.

14:23.465 --> 14:26.855
It beats having me bum bounced back
across the pond.

14:27.179 --> 14:31.218
- Let's give it a bash.
- Oh, yes, this is foolproof!

14:35.569 --> 14:38.527
(Niles) I'm about to defraud
the US Immigration Department.

14:38.824 --> 14:40.701
So is my father, my older brother.

14:40.952 --> 14:45.901
People who should be my role models.
I'm the product of a bad environment.

14:46.295 --> 14:50.493
If the guard asks you a question
can you say anything -

14:50.844 --> 14:52.960
- in an American accent?
- (American accent) Sure.

14:53.222 --> 14:55.099
- OK, what?
- You heard it.

14:55.351 --> 14:57.387
- What?
- Sure.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.577
That's all I can say.
I need a cup of tea.

15:02.905 --> 15:08.662
Tea? Why not wave a crumpet in the air
and sing "God Save the Queen"?

15:10.459 --> 15:14.737
You're a psychiatrist. You should
be in control of your emotions.

15:15.091 --> 15:17.605
Oh, my God, there's the border!

15:17.888 --> 15:21.198
All right.
Now calm down. We're gonna be fine.

15:21.519 --> 15:24.909
Remember, they'll be looking
for suspicious behaviour.

15:25.233 --> 15:27.667
Niles, that qualifies.

15:27.947 --> 15:31.906
If the guard pokes his head in here,
what will he see?

15:32.245 --> 15:35.794
(All)
Four carefree Americans.

15:36.126 --> 15:39.755
- I've never been so nervous.
- There isn't any need to be.

15:40.092 --> 15:43.004
They're waving everybody through
without any questions!

15:43.305 --> 15:45.102
Please, please!

15:45.350 --> 15:48.706
They're waving us through.
They're waving us through!

15:49.022 --> 15:51.092
They're pulling us over!

15:52.027 --> 15:54.336
They're pulling us over!

15:58.162 --> 16:00.312
(Dad) The guard.
(Daphne) I can't do this.

16:00.583 --> 16:03.620
It's going to be fine.
Just keep your answers short.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.436
Guilty people always talk too much.

16:07.637 --> 16:11.152
- Hi, folks. Enjoyed Canada?
- (Frasier and Dad) Great!

16:11.476 --> 16:13.990
What was the purpose of your trip?

16:16.318 --> 16:18.274
Fun.

16:23.413 --> 16:25.369
I see.

16:25.624 --> 16:28.092
- Where were you born?
- Seattle, Washington.

16:28.379 --> 16:31.496
You want to know what country.
America, of course!

16:31.801 --> 16:35.635
I'm quite an American. I always vote
for the law and order guy...

16:35.975 --> 16:38.364
That's fine, I don't need any more detail.

16:38.647 --> 16:40.922
And you, miss?

16:41.192 --> 16:43.148
Enjoy Canada?

16:43.404 --> 16:45.520
Sure.

16:45.783 --> 16:48.092
And the weather?

16:48.371 --> 16:50.202
Sure.
Sure.

16:52.961 --> 16:57.079
- Is this your vehicle?
- No. Yes, well, I rented it.

16:57.427 --> 17:01.056
It's American-made.
I always look for that union label.

17:01.392 --> 17:04.828
- I need your licence and registration.
- It's right here.

17:05.147 --> 17:09.585
The registration... Let me get
my licence out for you. Here we are.

17:12.536 --> 17:15.209
Stay right here.

17:15.499 --> 17:19.777
Well, I certainly can
depend on my gang, can't l?

17:23.679 --> 17:27.035
- I'm going to be arrested!
- We're all getting arrested.

17:27.351 --> 17:30.900
But I have delicate features.
Prison will be hell for me.

17:32.569 --> 17:34.878
Cool it, Niles.

17:35.156 --> 17:38.671
It's too late to turn back.
I say we make a run for it.

17:38.996 --> 17:43.353
Oh, great idea! A high-speed chase
in an eight-ton motor home!

17:43.712 --> 17:47.148
An amusing anecdote
for the border guard newsletter.

17:47.468 --> 17:51.302
Shut up. Keep babbling like this,
they'll catch us for sure.

17:51.641 --> 17:53.632
He's coming back.

17:54.730 --> 17:56.686
Well, these check out.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.981
We're all strictly on the up and up.

18:01.324 --> 18:06.159
Miss, you've been very quiet.
Is there something I should know here?

18:06.541 --> 18:09.499
You seem awfully nervous.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.391
May I have your name, please?

18:15.848 --> 18:20.126
Aw, all right. I should have
known better than to try this.

18:20.481 --> 18:24.918
- It was wrong!
- Just back off. What is it, sir?

18:26.157 --> 18:30.628
We were trying to put one over on you.
Eddie!

18:32.751 --> 18:37.700
- We don't have a rabies certificate.
- I knew something was going on here.

18:38.093 --> 18:42.291
We weren't planning on coming,
and at the border, we forgot.

18:42.642 --> 18:44.792
I didn't know you needed one.

18:45.063 --> 18:47.657
But ignorance of the law is no defence,

18:47.943 --> 18:50.411
so take the little dog away
and we'll be off.

18:54.996 --> 18:59.228
If you're worried,
we picked the dog up here in Canada.

18:59.587 --> 19:02.101
I got a picture I can show you.

19:02.383 --> 19:06.342
Here's a picture of him
taken at the Seattle Space Needle.

19:07.224 --> 19:10.739
- I see you got a badge there.
- Oh, yeah!

19:12.525 --> 19:14.800
- Are you a policeman?
- Retired.

19:15.070 --> 19:18.107
Thirty years on the Force.
I should know better.

19:18.409 --> 19:20.047
- Absolutely.
- Definitely.

19:20.288 --> 19:21.926
Sure.

19:27.132 --> 19:30.090
Next time, remember
the rabies certificate. Have a safe trip.

19:30.387 --> 19:33.663
- Thanks, Officer.
- Thank you.

19:35.980 --> 19:37.811
Drive!

19:42.741 --> 19:44.652
(Barks)

19:44.912 --> 19:47.745
Oh,
they'd have returned you eventually!

19:51.339 --> 19:53.648
- How long till we get home?
- Two hours.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.441
This highway goes right into Seattle.

19:56.722 --> 20:00.510
- Why don't you take a nap?
- Oh, no, I'm OK.

20:00.855 --> 20:05.246
- Thought maybe we'd chat a little.
- Oh, yeah, great.

20:16.380 --> 20:20.976
I can't help it. When we're alone,
I don't know what to say.

20:22.182 --> 20:24.821
That's why I asked Daphne to come.

20:25.103 --> 20:28.493
I had my suspicions,
but I'd hoped that wasn't the case.

20:28.817 --> 20:31.490
Knock it off.
That's why you asked Niles.

20:31.780 --> 20:35.739
That's why I asked him,
but that's not why he came.

20:37.373 --> 20:42.163
Well, the funny thing is
we didn't have such a bad time, did we?

20:44.343 --> 20:47.858
"l see you got a badge there."
"Oh, yeah!"

20:50.854 --> 20:53.652
- Pretty slick, huh?
- Yeah.

21:00.245 --> 21:03.043
There's no reason to cut our trip short.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.893
We're not that far from Yellowstone.

21:06.170 --> 21:09.924
- I always wanted to see Old Faithful.
- Me, too.

21:10.261 --> 21:15.654
If you want a real adventure,
we could drop these two off home first.

21:16.062 --> 21:19.259
- Just the two of us, alone?
- Yeah!

21:19.568 --> 21:22.366
- Just you and me, father and son?
- Yeah.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.648
Yeah, you and me,
camping in Yellowstone, all alone.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.989
All by ourselves!

21:36.512 --> 21:41.267
Well, it'd be a shame if Daphne
didn't get to see those Indian paint pots.

21:41.646 --> 21:45.355
- Of course.
- They are a real miracle of nature.

21:45.694 --> 21:48.970
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wouldn't be fair to leave Niles alone.

21:49.283 --> 21:53.515
- Maris out of town, that'd be cruel.
- Yeah, absolutely.

21:53.874 --> 21:57.503
- How far is it to Yellowstone?
- We'll be there tomorrow.

21:57.839 --> 22:01.309
It'd be a nice surprise
for those two when they wake up.

22:01.638 --> 22:05.392
I got a better surprise.
Let's tell Daphne we're in Mexico!

22:12.447 --> 22:16.520
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:18.289 --> 22:19.358
# Mercy

22:19.583 --> 22:25.260
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:26.762 --> 22:30.437
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:32.647 --> 22:34.922
# They're calling again

22:35.401 --> 22:37.039
Good night, Seattle, we love you.
