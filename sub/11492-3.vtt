Nope. You?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.364
No.

I'll explain later.
Hey, Charlie.

Don't worry, I'm still
moving in with Lyndsey.

I live here.

00:41.312 --> 00:42.512
Can we do this again?

00:42.513 --> 00:43.846
Again?

Well, maybe you can do it
again, but men are different.

09:17.961 --> 09:20.163
Uh, not, you know,
lost like died.

09:20.164 --> 09:23.365
Uh, more like,
uh, uh, misplaced.

09:23.366 --> 09:25.267
Oh, thank goodness.

09:25.268 --> 09:26.869
Yeah.
Hey, Alan?

09:26.870 --> 09:27.970
Yeah?

09:27.971 --> 09:29.805
I'm just wondering--

09:29.806 --> 09:33.642
how does a chiropractor
misplace a patient?

09:36.847 --> 09:38.314
Good question.

09:38.315 --> 09:39.850
I thought so.

09:40.719 --> 09:44.555
Well, uh, uh,
he's an elderly fellow

09:44.556 --> 09:47.692
who in addition to scoliosis,

09:47.693 --> 09:51.129
uh, also has dementia.

09:51.130 --> 09:54.366
So I-I just spent
the last hour and a half

09:54.367 --> 09:56.301
driving up and down
Ventura Boulevard

09:56.302 --> 09:59.337
looking for a, you know,
shirtless, hunched over
80-year-old man.

10:00.705 --> 10:02.573
Found quite a few.

10:02.574 --> 10:05.942
But none of them were mine.

10:05.943 --> 10:08.044
So he's still out there?

10:11.015 --> 10:12.348
Yeah.

10:13.484 --> 10:15.352
Did you call the police?

10:17.655 --> 10:19.290
Yes, Charlie, I did.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.726
What did they say?

10:21.727 --> 10:25.764
They thanked me for my help,

10:25.765 --> 10:27.332
and, uh, told me to go home

10:27.333 --> 10:28.967
and let them do their job.

10:28.968 --> 10:31.269
So, uh, so here I am-- home.

10:31.270 --> 10:33.271
Better late than never.

10:33.272 --> 10:36.374
Oh, please, you've never
given never a chance.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.575
Do you mind?

10:37.576 --> 10:39.777
Actually I do.
I thought I made that clear.

10:39.778 --> 10:41.011
All right, all right.

10:41.012 --> 10:43.246
Melissa, we can't
do this anymore.

10:43.247 --> 10:45.348
I agree.
You do?

10:45.349 --> 10:48.217
Yes. I think I should
move in here with you.

10:48.218 --> 10:49.251
Here?

10:49.252 --> 10:50.419
Here?

10:50.420 --> 10:53.121
Why don't we talk about it
after we make love.

10:53.122 --> 10:54.589
Uh, okay.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.961
It could work.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.763
♪ Men. ♪

11:03.457 --> 11:04.858
♪ Men. ♪

11:06.060 --> 11:08.127
Okay, I'm just gonna go home
and get some things.

11:08.128 --> 11:09.361
I'll be back
in a little while.

11:09.362 --> 11:11.630
Great.

11:16.769 --> 11:18.302
That's really getting annoying.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.504
Do me a favor,
talk me through this.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.206
Excuse me?

11:22.207 --> 11:23.741
What's your strategy?

11:23.742 --> 11:26.444
'Splain it to me, Lucy!

11:26.445 --> 11:30.315
Okay, admittedly, I may have
overplayed my hand a little.

11:30.316 --> 11:31.650
A little?

11:31.651 --> 11:34.353
You're living with Lyndsey
and you asked Melissa

11:34.354 --> 11:37.090
to move in here!

11:37.091 --> 11:38.691
Yeah, I got to work on that.

11:38.692 --> 11:39.959
So, listen,

11:39.960 --> 11:43.163
when Melissa comes back,
make some sort of excuse. Uh...

11:43.164 --> 11:45.032
Oh, what, you mean like "I was
cruising Ventura Boulevard

11:45.033 --> 11:47.234
for an old,
shirtless hunchback"?

11:47.235 --> 11:49.570
Yeah, not my finest moment.

11:49.571 --> 11:51.338
You're experienced
at that kind of thing.

11:51.339 --> 11:53.374
No, no, I'm experienced
at promiscuity.

11:53.375 --> 11:54.808
This is polygamy.

11:54.809 --> 11:57.744
And frankly, I find it
extremely distasteful.

11:57.745 --> 12:00.381
Oh, oh, this you find
distasteful?

12:00.382 --> 12:03.550
The man who was asked to leave
Bangkok for moral turpitude

12:03.551 --> 12:06.888
finds this distasteful?

12:06.889 --> 12:08.690
That was a
misunderstanding.

12:08.691 --> 12:09.724
Mmm.

12:09.725 --> 12:10.659
I had no idea

12:10.660 --> 12:12.661
it was an
endangered species.

12:12.662 --> 12:15.363
Well, nothing I'm doing
requires a ten-day quarantine

12:15.364 --> 12:17.065
and a series of rabies shots.

12:18.067 --> 12:20.035
Oh. Hello.

12:20.036 --> 12:21.937
Oh, Mom, thank
God you're here.

12:21.938 --> 12:24.273
Your sarcasm is unappreciated,
Charlie.

12:24.274 --> 12:26.609
No, no, really. You
got to talk to Alan

12:26.610 --> 12:28.310
and tell him not to screw
up this thing with Lyndsey.

12:28.311 --> 12:30.146
Who's Lyndsey?
My girlfriend.

12:30.147 --> 12:31.680
You have a girlfriend?

12:31.681 --> 12:32.915
He moved in
with her.

12:32.916 --> 12:35.484
You moved in with
a girlfriend?

12:35.485 --> 12:37.553
Yeah, and he's cheating on
her with his ex-girlfriend,

12:37.554 --> 12:39.988
and he invited that
one to move in here.

12:39.989 --> 12:42.157
When were you planning
to tell me all this?

12:42.825 --> 12:43.759
We're telling
you now.

12:43.760 --> 12:44.760
So as usual,

12:44.761 --> 12:45.928
I'm the last to know.

12:45.929 --> 12:47.663
Mom, Mom, focus.

12:47.664 --> 12:48.998
He moved out.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.167
After seven years of putting
up with him and his kid,

12:51.168 --> 12:52.135
he finally moved out.

12:52.136 --> 12:53.537
And I need him
to stay out.

12:53.538 --> 12:55.205
So Jake is gone, too?

12:55.206 --> 12:56.974
No one thought to call me.

12:56.975 --> 12:59.710
Okay, as usual,
you're just useless.

13:01.379 --> 13:03.848
Alan, this can't go on
any longer.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.783
You have to choose between
Lyndsey and Melissa,

13:05.784 --> 13:07.217
and you have to choose now.

13:07.218 --> 13:10.153
You're right, you're right.

13:10.154 --> 13:12.689
What to do?

13:12.690 --> 13:14.925
When did he start
smoking a pipe?

13:14.926 --> 13:17.094
I don't know.
This is new.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.029
That's probably Lyndsey.

13:19.030 --> 13:20.297
Which one
is Lyndsey?

13:20.298 --> 13:21.598
The one he moved in with.

13:21.599 --> 13:22.666
What's wrong
with her?

13:22.667 --> 13:25.035
Single mom, teenage son.

13:25.036 --> 13:26.469
So desperate?

13:26.470 --> 13:29.873
Like a goldfish
in a leaky bag.

13:29.874 --> 13:31.108
Oh, my God.

13:31.109 --> 13:34.678
Lyndsey is apologizing to me.

13:34.679 --> 13:35.946
Says she was wrong.

13:35.947 --> 13:37.047
About what?

13:37.048 --> 13:39.783
What difference does it make?

13:39.784 --> 13:42.218
I won an argument with a woman.

13:42.219 --> 13:45.421
Which is why
she's the gal for you.

13:45.422 --> 13:46.589
Go to her.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.257
Love her, cherish her.

13:48.258 --> 13:49.758
I don't know.

13:49.759 --> 13:52.528
Okay, then take her for granted
and treat her like crap

13:52.529 --> 13:54.095
until she hangs herself,
but go!

13:54.096 --> 13:56.131
What about Melissa?

13:56.132 --> 13:57.265
You have to break that off.

13:57.266 --> 13:58.399
You're right, you're right.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.568
I have to step up and be a man.

14:00.569 --> 14:01.536
What are you doing?

14:01.537 --> 14:03.337
I'm telling Melissa it's over.

14:03.338 --> 14:06.073
With a text?

14:06.074 --> 14:09.744
Well, I'm putting
a little sad face at the end.

14:11.447 --> 14:16.318
All right, well, uh,
guess it's time to go home

14:16.319 --> 14:17.786
and come clean with Lyndsey.

14:17.787 --> 14:19.422
No, no, no. No coming clean.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.859
Unless you're
banging Mr. Bubble.

14:24.695 --> 14:26.896
But I-I don't want
to build our new life together

14:26.897 --> 14:27.997
on a foundation of lies.

14:27.998 --> 14:29.832
Oh, yes, you do.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.701
Listen to
your mother.

14:33.970 --> 14:35.170
Trust me.

14:35.171 --> 14:38.206
No good ever comes
from revealing an indiscretion.

14:38.207 --> 14:39.507
And you know this how?

14:39.508 --> 14:41.342
I'd rather not say.

14:41.343 --> 14:44.111
Wait, so you're saying
when you were married...

14:44.112 --> 14:47.348
Whoa, whoa, when did everything
become about me?

14:47.349 --> 14:48.916
When we were born.

14:48.917 --> 14:50.618
Hey, don't get me
started on that.

14:50.619 --> 14:53.221
My episiotomy still itches.

14:56.025 --> 15:00.429
My point, Alan, is, it is
not fair to ease your conscience

15:00.430 --> 15:02.765
by dumping your sins
on the woman you love.

15:02.766 --> 15:04.534
Yeah, Alan,
don't be selfish.

15:05.502 --> 15:08.271
What now?

15:08.272 --> 15:09.539
Oh.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.942
Melissa's not taking it well.

15:11.943 --> 15:15.613
"I hate you, you
stupid cork soaker"?

15:15.614 --> 15:18.049
Auto spell check.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.718
Anyway... I got to go.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.387
Bye, Mom.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.192
Okay, we dodged a bullet.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.961
Yep. So now
that he's gone,

15:29.962 --> 15:32.030
what are you gonna do
with that empty room?

15:32.031 --> 15:34.032
Uh, why do you ask?

15:34.033 --> 15:36.668
I was just thinking, it
might be nice to spend

15:36.669 --> 15:38.936
the occasional weekend
here on the beach.

15:40.473 --> 15:44.441

should see your face.

off like that.

15:54.518 --> 15:57.086
No, no, you had every right.

15:57.087 --> 15:59.755

were some kind of houseguest.

15:59.756 --> 16:01.623
That's okay,

16:01.624 --> 16:04.325
Seven years with Charlie,
a dozen years with Judith

16:04.326 --> 16:06.428
and all that time
with my mom.

16:06.429 --> 16:08.896
Well, from now on,
this house is your home.

16:08.897 --> 16:11.032

16:11.033 --> 16:12.568
you just go right ahead
and do it.

16:12.569 --> 16:14.236
Really?

16:14.237 --> 16:16.806
Can I hang my chiropractor of
the year plaque on the wall?

16:16.807 --> 16:17.907
Of course.

16:17.908 --> 16:18.942
In the living room?

16:18.943 --> 16:20.210
Wherever you want.

16:20.211 --> 16:22.546
Charlie made me hang
it in my bathroom.

16:22.547 --> 16:24.115
Well, I'm not Charlie.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.284
And I'm proud you're
chiropractor of the year.

16:26.285 --> 16:29.720
Oh, oh, not this
year, uh, 2002.

16:29.721 --> 16:32.223
After that, they tightened
up the voting rules.

16:32.224 --> 16:36.127
So, uh, what about
acidophilus milk?

16:36.128 --> 16:37.228
What about it?

16:37.229 --> 16:39.231
I like it.
Then we'll get it.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.233
And I can keep it
in the refrigerator?

16:41.234 --> 16:42.468
Where else would you keep it?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.236
Charlie made me keep
all my dairy products

16:44.237 --> 16:46.371
in an ice chest
in the garage.

16:46.372 --> 16:47.773
That's terrible.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.808
I lost so much cheese.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.644
Oh, honey.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.213
Well, this is your home now.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.649
And you can put your cheese
wherever you want.

16:56.650 --> 16:59.318
Can I sing show
tunes in the shower?

16:59.319 --> 17:01.187
Charlie didn't let you
sing show tunes?

17:01.188 --> 17:02.222
No, that was my mother.

17:02.223 --> 17:04.558
Said I was effeminate
enough already.

17:04.559 --> 17:08.194
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you are all man.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.963
Oh, Lyndsey.

17:09.964 --> 17:11.298
You're too good to me.

17:11.299 --> 17:13.500
Oh, it's only
what you deserve.

17:14.736 --> 17:17.771
Okay, I-I can't live
with this guilt.

17:17.771 --> 17:19.339
I have to confess
something.

17:19.340 --> 17:20.340
What?

17:20.342 --> 17:21.575
Okay.

17:21.576 --> 17:24.277
Uh, a few days ago, I-I ran
into an ex-girlfriend,

17:24.278 --> 17:26.213
who I had a lot
of chemistry with.

17:26.214 --> 17:27.580
And you had sex with her.

17:27.582 --> 17:29.016
Let me finish.

17:31.653 --> 17:33.154
No.

17:35.357 --> 17:38.226
I-I did not have
sex with her.

17:38.227 --> 17:39.794
Then why do you feel guilty?

17:39.795 --> 17:43.565
Uh, well, after
I ran into her,

17:43.566 --> 17:47.437
I, uh, uh, I-I
found myself,

17:47.438 --> 17:50.974
uh, fantasizing
a-about her.

17:50.975 --> 17:53.243
Fantasizing? That's it?

17:53.244 --> 17:54.445
That's it.

17:54.446 --> 17:56.580
Uh, and nothing crazy,
just straight missionary.

17:56.581 --> 18:00.718
Sweetie, we all fantasize.

18:00.719 --> 18:03.554
Every time I go to the car wash,
I imagine myself

18:03.555 --> 18:06.624
being bent over a soapy BMW
by a man with calloused hands

18:06.625 --> 18:07.792
and no green card.

18:07.793 --> 18:09.027
Really?

18:09.028 --> 18:10.061
Every time?

18:10.062 --> 18:12.497
It's not always a BMW.

19:02.483 --> 19:03.850
What'd you do to her?

19:03.851 --> 19:05.085
Nothing.

19:05.086 --> 19:06.320
What'd he do to you?

19:06.321 --> 19:08.555
He won't tell me
where his brother is.

19:08.556 --> 19:09.522
I can't.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.757
I'm not a rat.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.459
What are you going to do
to Alan when you find him?

19:13.460 --> 19:15.428
Oh, same thing I did
to Charlie, but worse.

19:15.429 --> 19:16.596
He's at Lyndsey's.

19:16.597 --> 19:18.998
1182 Bonnie Meadow Drive.

19:20.267 --> 19:22.502
Sherman Oaks, big blue house.

19:22.503 --> 19:24.170
Uh-oh.

19:29.843 --> 19:31.477
I'm sorry, Charlie.

19:34.115 --> 19:36.650
Oh, stop whining.

19:36.651 --> 19:39.386
On some level,
I'm sure you had it coming.

19:42.258 --> 19:43.892
♪ Men. ♪

19:43.893 --> 19:45.393
So I was
thinking of

19:45.394 --> 19:47.595
turning that little
storage room into a den.

19:47.596 --> 19:49.664
You know, kind
of a man cave.

19:49.665 --> 19:51.532
Whatever you want, sweetie.

19:51.533 --> 19:52.767
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:52.768 --> 19:55.970
So I can get a flat
screen, maybe a wet bar?

19:55.971 --> 19:58.807
If that's what it takes
to make you happy here.

19:58.808 --> 20:01.509
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

20:01.510 --> 20:03.178
Enough talking.

20:03.179 --> 20:05.179
Let's make love in <i>our</i> home.

20:05.180 --> 20:07.481
Oh, yes, <i>our</i> home.

20:12.954 --> 20:15.356
Do you smell
something burning?

20:15.357 --> 20:17.591
♪ Men. ♪

20:20.010 --> 20:21.010
Here you go.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.246
Thank you.

20:23.247 --> 20:24.714
How are you feeling?

20:24.715 --> 20:28.519
I think she punched my right nut
up into my rib cage.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.954
Poor baby.

20:29.955 --> 20:31.822
You want Mommy
to take a look?

20:31.823 --> 20:33.524
No, thanks.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.759
I have seen them before.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.161
I know.

20:37.162 --> 20:40.064
I imagine they're hanging
a lot lower now.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.135
Right back
at ya, Mom.

20:44.136 --> 20:47.505
Touché, darling.

20:55.780 --> 20:59.450
You will never guess
what happened.
