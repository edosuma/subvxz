WEBVTT

00:08.129 --> 00:09.970
OH, THERE'S
THE FOOD TRUCK.

00:09.970 --> 00:12.053
I'M SO NERVOUS.
GATOR'S BEEN GONE FOR WEEKS,

00:12.053 --> 00:13.844
AND THIS IS MY FIRST TIME
BACK TO WORK

00:13.844 --> 00:15.346
SINCE I BROKE UP
WITH HER DAUGHTER.

00:15.346 --> 00:17.438
GATOR'S GONNA CLAMP
DOWN ON MY HEAD

00:17.438 --> 00:20.311
AND DRAG ME UNDERWATER
LIKE A... GATOR.

00:20.311 --> 00:22.403
AH, I THOUGHT FOR SURE
YOU WERE GONNA SAY

00:22.403 --> 00:24.355
TERRITORIAL HIPPO.

00:24.355 --> 00:25.906
MAYBE YOU'RE
WORRYING FOR NOTHING.

00:25.906 --> 00:27.858
GATOR KNOWS
YOU'RE A GOOD EMPLOYEE.

00:27.858 --> 00:30.111
YEAH, SHE'S PROBABLY
NOT HOLDING A GRUDGE.

00:30.111 --> 00:32.413
- TYLER!
- ( shrieks )

00:32.413 --> 00:35.746
I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU A LESSON...

00:35.746 --> 00:37.418
ABOUT CHAINSAW ART.

00:37.418 --> 00:40.541
IT'S MY NEW HOBBY.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.963
WELL, I'M HAPPY
YOU'RE BACK,

00:42.963 --> 00:45.546
AND I JUST WANNA SAY
I'M SORRY THINGS
DIDN'T WORK OUT

00:45.546 --> 00:48.048
- BETWEEN ME AND EMILY.
- YEAH, I'M SORRY, TOO.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.171
AND NOW, I HAVE
TO FIRE YOU.

00:50.171 --> 00:52.553
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE
YOU BROKE UP WITH EMILY.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.307
OH, SHE'S HAD FIVE
BOYFRIENDS SINCE YOU.
OH, WAY BETTER.

00:56.307 --> 00:59.310
SO WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO FIRE ME?
WAY BETTER?

00:59.310 --> 01:01.272
I JUST CAN'T AFFORD
YOU ANYMORE.

01:01.272 --> 01:03.394
BUSINESS IS DOWN,
AND I'VE GOT

01:03.394 --> 01:05.396
SOME EXPENSIVE
VIOLATIONS TO CORRECT.

01:05.396 --> 01:08.449
APPARENTLY, WHEN YOU
CALL BURGERS "ALL BEEF,"

01:08.449 --> 01:11.692
THEY HAVE TO BE ALL
AND BEEF.

01:11.692 --> 01:15.906
BUT, GATOR, WORKING
AT THE FOOD TRUCK
WAS MY DREAM JOB.

01:15.906 --> 01:18.909
WHERE ELSE CAN I COOK
CHEAP FOOD AND RUN
A CASH REGISTER?

01:18.909 --> 01:22.753
I DON'T KNOW, TYLER.
THAT'S YOUR JOURNEY.

01:24.165 --> 01:26.207
SO TYLER LOST HIS JOB.

01:26.207 --> 01:28.339
BUT NOT BECAUSE
HE DUMPED THE BOSS' DAUGHTER.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.550
GATOR GETS IT.

01:29.550 --> 01:31.762
SOMETIMES,
YOU GOTTA MOVE ON.

01:31.762 --> 01:33.214
DOGS DO THAT
ALL THE TIME.

01:33.214 --> 01:36.016
I'LL LOVE YOU
FOREVER, BABY.

01:36.016 --> 01:37.598
HELLO THERE.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.522
YEAH, IT'S NOT
WORKIN' OUT.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.542
AVERY, I FIGURED OUT
HOW TO GET MY JOB BACK.

02:01.542 --> 02:03.834
I'M GONNA MAKE
A COMMERCIAL FOR THE FOOD TRUCK,

02:03.834 --> 02:06.337
PUT IT ONLINE, IT'LL DRUM UP
SO MUCH BUSINESS,

02:06.337 --> 02:08.209
GATOR WILL
HAVE TO REHIRE ME.

02:08.209 --> 02:10.341
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A PRETTY HALF-BAKED PLAN.

02:10.341 --> 02:12.343
WHICH IS TWICE AS BAKED

02:12.343 --> 02:15.426
AS YOUR TYPICAL QUARTER-BAKED
PLANS, SO CONGRATULATIONS.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.678
THE COMMERCIAL'S
GONNA BE COOL.

02:17.678 --> 02:19.890
IT'LL START WITH ME DOING
TRICKS ON MY BIKE,

02:19.890 --> 02:22.102
HOT GIRLS ARE WATCHING,
AND THEN, AT THE END,

02:22.102 --> 02:25.266
A BIG EXPLOSION.
( imitates explosion )

02:25.266 --> 02:26.817
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH THE FOOD TRUCK?

02:26.817 --> 02:28.479
NOTHING, BUT
PEOPLE WILL SAY,

02:28.479 --> 02:30.691
"THAT WAS AWESOME.

02:30.691 --> 02:33.574
I WONDER IF THEIR FOOD
TASTES LIKE WHAT I JUST SAW."

02:33.574 --> 02:35.446
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.617
LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE.

02:36.617 --> 02:39.410
WHAT YOU NEED

A SECRET DREAM OF MINE

02:52.293 --> 02:54.255
TO RECORD A SONG,
AND THIS COMMERCIAL

02:54.255 --> 02:56.347
COULD BE A GREAT CHANCE
FOR ME TO DO THAT.

02:56.347 --> 02:59.220

PART-TIME AT THE FOOD
TRUCK AGAIN.

03:14.575 --> 03:16.367
BOTH OF OUR DREAMS
WILL COME TRUE.

03:22.373 --> 03:24.285
MOMMY, WHEN YOU WERE
MY AGE,

03:24.285 --> 03:26.287
WAS THERE EVER ANYTHING
YOU REALLY, REALLY WANTED

03:26.287 --> 03:27.748
BUT YOU JUST
COULDN'T BUY IT?

03:27.748 --> 03:30.331

- NO, SOMETHING GOOD.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.544
I WANT A CHARM BRACELET.

03:33.544 --> 03:37.338
I MEAN, WORLD PEACE
IS GREAT FOR OLD PEOPLE,
BUT KIDS LIKE THINGS.

03:37.338 --> 03:40.761
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
I OPENED A LEMONADE STAND.

03:40.761 --> 03:43.394
AND I DIDN'T
HAVE TO ASK
MY PARENTS FOR MONEY.

03:43.394 --> 03:46.016
- THEN WHAT WERE THEY FOR?
- MAINLY GUILT,

03:46.016 --> 03:48.349
AND PRESSURE
TO PLAY SPORTS.

03:48.349 --> 03:50.311
( laughs )

03:50.311 --> 03:53.193
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

03:53.193 --> 03:55.446
BUT ALSO, TO PROVIDE
AN EXAMPLE

03:55.446 --> 03:58.068
THAT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,
YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT.

03:58.068 --> 04:01.201

10:36.426 --> 10:39.099
TO SHAMELESSLY
MANIPULATE ME LIKE THIS.

10:39.099 --> 10:42.262
YOU DOING THIS
MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.

10:42.262 --> 10:46.436
- DADDY, ARE YOU OKAY?
- MY PARENTS FORCED ME
TO DO SPORTS.

10:46.436 --> 10:48.608
SO YOU'LL DO
MY LEMONADE STAND FOR ME?

10:48.608 --> 10:50.731
NO. WE'RE GONNA
DO IT TOGETHER.

10:50.731 --> 10:53.323
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE
IN A BIG, BIG WAY.

10:53.323 --> 10:55.235
I'M NOT GONNA
GO OVERBOARD.

10:57.537 --> 11:01.081
LEMONADE. GET YOUR
OLD-FASHIONED LEMONADE.

11:03.203 --> 11:06.206
DADDY?
DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?

11:06.206 --> 11:10.340
NOT NOW, SWEETIE.
DADDY'S IN THE SELLIN' ZONE.

11:10.340 --> 11:13.053
I JUST HAVE TO ASK HIM THAT
EVERY TEN MINUTES,

11:13.053 --> 11:14.674
BECAUSE WE'RE
DOING IT TOGETHER.

11:16.887 --> 11:19.389
AVERY, I JUST TALKED
TO GATOR DOWN AT
THE FOOD TRUCK.

11:19.389 --> 11:21.261
SHE REALLY LIKED
THE COMMERCIAL.

11:21.261 --> 11:22.853
I MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET MY JOB BACK.

11:22.853 --> 11:25.105
AT LEAST SOME GOOD
CAME OUT OF IT.

11:25.105 --> 11:27.107
TELL ME, DOES THIS SOUND
LIKE HOW I SING?

11:27.107 --> 11:29.730
( air escaping,
squeaking loudly )

11:30.941 --> 11:33.483
BECAUSE THIS GUY
SAYS IT DOES.

11:33.483 --> 11:36.737
YOU'RE LETTING
THE OPINION OF
CAPTAIN DUCKFART

11:36.737 --> 11:38.238
RUIN YOUR DAY?

11:38.238 --> 11:40.240
YES, I AM.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.323
I'VE NEVER BEEN CRITICIZED
FOR SOMETHING I'VE DONE BEFORE.

11:43.323 --> 11:45.876
MAYBE I'VE HAD AN OVER-INFLATED
SENSE OF MYSELF,

11:45.876 --> 11:47.627
AND NOW, I'M JUST LIKE...

11:50.751 --> 11:52.923
AVERY, YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN CRITICIZED

11:52.923 --> 11:55.675
IN YOUR OWN LITTLE
WORLD AT SCHOOL WHERE
EVERYONE LIKES YOU.

11:55.675 --> 11:58.218
NOW YOU'RE PUTTING
YOURSELF OUT THERE
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.391
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD?

12:01.391 --> 12:02.642
WAY TO BURST MY BUBBLE.

12:04.554 --> 12:07.227
YOU KNOW I LIKE TO
BLOW UP BALLOONS
WHEN I'M UPSET.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.939
I DON'T,
AND IT'S WEIRD.

12:11.351 --> 12:13.403
ANYWAY, I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD.

12:13.403 --> 12:15.405
THERE'S JUST A LOT
OF HATERS OUT THERE.

12:15.405 --> 12:17.357
WHAT IF
THE HATERS ARE RIGHT?

12:17.357 --> 12:19.199
THIS IS REALLY
MESSING WITH MY HEAD.

12:19.199 --> 12:20.570
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.202
I'M NOT USED TO
PEOPLE CALLING ME

12:22.202 --> 12:24.955
INCOMPETENT, LIMITED,
AND LACKING ABILITY.

12:24.955 --> 12:26.917
SORRY. I PLAY SQUASH
EVERY TUESDAY

12:26.917 --> 12:28.708
WITH YOUR GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

12:28.708 --> 12:32.212
I HAVE
A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR?

12:32.212 --> 12:35.295
I JUST WISH THAT I'D NEVER
PUT MYSELF OUT THERE LIKE THAT.

12:35.295 --> 12:36.716
I'M NEVER SINGING AGAIN.

12:36.716 --> 12:38.378
SO HOW ABOUT
ONE MORE TIME?

12:38.378 --> 12:40.380
YA MIGHT WANNA LEARN
WHAT NEVER MEANS

12:40.380 --> 12:42.432
BEFORE YOU MEET WITH
YOUR GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,

12:42.432 --> 12:44.554
BECAUSE SHE'S GONNA BE
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT COLLEGES.

12:44.554 --> 12:47.647
AVERY, THE COMMERCIAL'S
BECOME REALLY POPULAR.

12:47.647 --> 12:50.440
SO GATOR THINKS SHE CAN
GET EVEN MORE BUSINESS

12:50.440 --> 12:53.193
IF YOU PERFORM THE SONG
LIVE AT THE FOOD TRUCK TOMORROW.

12:53.193 --> 12:55.525
SHE SAID IF THINGS GO WELL,
SHE'LL HIRE ME BACK.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.398
SO IF I DON'T SING,
YOU DON'T GET YOUR JOB BACK?

12:58.398 --> 13:00.991
I'M SURE SHE'S NOT
THAT UNREASONABLE.

13:00.991 --> 13:03.403
SO IS SHE
GONNA SING?

13:03.403 --> 13:05.785
'CAUSE IF SHE DOESN'T, YOU'RE
NOT GETTIN' YOUR JOB BACK,

13:05.785 --> 13:07.868
AND IF YOU THINK
THAT'S UNREASONABLE,

13:07.868 --> 13:09.789
I'M ALSO GONNA DOCK
HIS PAY.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
HOW CAN YOU DOCK HIS PAY
IF HE DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.294
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO UNREASONABLE.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.128
TWO MORE LEMONADES,
PLEASE.

13:18.128 --> 13:19.629
FINE.

13:19.629 --> 13:21.882
TYLER, I KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS JOB MEANS TO YOU,

13:21.882 --> 13:24.594
SO I'LL SING AT
THE FOOD TRUCK TOMORROW.

13:24.594 --> 13:26.847
THANK YOU, AVERY.
I REALLY OWE YOU.

13:26.847 --> 13:31.231
NOW I DON'T THROW AROUND
THE WORD "HERO" VERY OFTEN,

13:31.231 --> 13:33.233
BUT THAT WOMAN IS MY HERO.

13:41.701 --> 13:43.703
WOW!
LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE.

13:43.703 --> 13:46.366
I DID THIS.

13:46.366 --> 13:49.209
TAKE THAT, GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

13:49.209 --> 13:52.002
WHOSE PICTURE
ARE THEY TAKING?

13:52.002 --> 13:54.504
HEY, IT'S THAT LADY
FROM THE VIDEO THAT
LAUGHS LIKE A DONKEY.

13:54.504 --> 13:56.006
HEY, DONKEY LAUGH LADY!

13:58.838 --> 14:02.222
I THINK THEY'RE
TAKING MY PICTURE.
I HAVE FANS.

14:02.222 --> 14:05.095
I DREAMED OF THIS DAY,
ALTHOUGH I DREAMED
THEY'D KNOW MY NAME,

14:05.095 --> 14:06.466
NOT CALL ME
DONKEY LAUGH LADY.

14:06.466 --> 14:09.179
BUT I'LL TAKE IT,
I'LL TAKE IT.

14:09.179 --> 14:10.310
DO THE LAUGH,
DO THE LAUGH.

14:10.310 --> 14:12.392
OH, I CAN'T JUST
LAUGH ON COMMAND LIKE...

14:12.392 --> 14:14.274
( braying laughter )

14:17.237 --> 14:20.901
SO, YOUR SISTER READY
FOR THE BIG SHOW, NOT BOB?

14:20.901 --> 14:22.322
WHY'D YOU CALL ME
NOT BOB?

14:22.322 --> 14:24.654
WELL, YOU'RE NOT BOB,
ARE YOU?

14:24.654 --> 14:28.248
I HAVE TO HAVE SOME WAY
TO TELL THE TWO OF YOU APART.
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, BOB?

14:28.248 --> 14:31.291
DON'T MEAN TO PUT
ANY PRESSURE ON Y'ALL

14:31.291 --> 14:33.413
BY CALLING IT A BIG SHOW,

14:33.413 --> 14:35.375
BUT THERE'S A LOT
RIDING ON THIS.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.257
THE FUTURE OF
THE FOOD TRUCK,
YOUR JOB,

14:37.257 --> 14:39.549
AND MY SPIDER VEIN SURGERY.

14:39.549 --> 14:42.552
DON'T WORRY.
AVERY IS READY TO SING.

14:42.552 --> 14:45.095
AND IF THIS IS TOO PERSONAL,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER,

14:45.095 --> 14:48.808
BUT WHEN THEY PUT
THE SPIDER VEINS IN,
DO YOU GET SUPERPOWERS?

14:48.808 --> 14:51.811
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW IT WORKS.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.187
CHLOE, YOUR NEW
CHARM BRACELET
IS BEAUTIFUL.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.359
BUT, UH, WHY AREN'T
YOU WEARING IT?

14:59.359 --> 15:02.072
WELL, AT FIRST, I JUST
WANTED YOU TO DO
THE LEMONADE STAND

15:02.072 --> 15:04.074
SO I COULD GET THIS,

15:04.074 --> 15:06.406
SO I DID
THE MANIPULATING THING,

15:06.406 --> 15:08.328
AND SAID I WANTED
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

15:08.328 --> 15:11.371
BUT THEN, BEING WITH YOU
IS MY FAVORITE PART.

15:11.371 --> 15:14.374
SO I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

15:15.956 --> 15:20.540
WELL... I LIKE
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU, TOO.

15:20.540 --> 15:23.173
BUT I DON'T THINK
THIS CHARM BRACELET

15:23.173 --> 15:26.046
GOES WITH ANY OF
MY CLOTHES.

15:26.046 --> 15:29.349
THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL WEAR IT FOR YOU.

15:31.551 --> 15:34.554
ALL RIGHT, AVERY,
ARE YOU READY TO GO ON?
LOOK AT THIS CROWD.

15:34.554 --> 15:37.317
THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL HERE
BECAUSE THEY LOVE YOU
IN THE VIDEO.

15:37.317 --> 15:39.399
I KNOW, AND I'M
REALLY NERVOUS.

15:39.399 --> 15:41.191
MY STOMACH
IS IN KNOTS.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.523
AND I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD
THAT ALL-BEEF TACO.

15:43.523 --> 15:47.277
YEAH, THAT ALL-BEEF TACO
IS NOT ALL... BEEF.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.199
OR TACO.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.741
I WISH I COULD
GO ON FOR YOU, AVERY.

15:51.741 --> 15:53.663
IF ONLY I HADN'T
TOUCHED THAT AMULET

15:53.663 --> 15:56.376
IN THAT ANCIENT
EGYPTIAN TEMPLE,
I'D STILL BE A MAN.

15:56.376 --> 15:59.749
- WHAT?
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A DOG.

16:01.081 --> 16:04.044
WELCOME TO
THE TRUCK STOPS HERE PRESENTS

16:04.044 --> 16:07.547
THE TRUCK STOPS HERE LIVE!

16:09.179 --> 16:11.721
WITH THE TRUCK STOPS HERE
SINGER,

16:11.721 --> 16:14.644
TRUCK STOP!

16:14.644 --> 16:16.306
I CHANGED YOUR NAME.

16:16.306 --> 16:19.309
I AM NOT LETTING HER
CHANGE MY NAME.

16:19.309 --> 16:22.192
NO WONDER THEY CALL YOU STOP,
ALWAYS TRYING TO STOP STUFF.

16:26.106 --> 16:28.238
HEY, IT'S THAT ANNOYING
GIRL FROM THE VIDEO.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.739
YOU STINK!

16:33.323 --> 16:35.075
STOP, TRUCK STOP.

16:35.075 --> 16:36.916
NOT BOB, STOP
TRUCK STOP,

16:36.916 --> 16:40.040
OR YOUR JOB HERE AT
THE TRUCK STOPS HERE
STOPS HERE.

16:42.172 --> 16:44.464
AVERY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU HAVE TO SING THE SONG,

16:44.464 --> 16:46.336
OR I'M NEVER
GETTING MY JOB BACK.

16:46.336 --> 16:48.048
YOU HEARD GATOR.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.260
SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE UNREASONABLY CLEAR.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.761
I'M SORRY, TYLER.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.973
I WAS ONLY ONSTAGE
FOR TWO SECONDS,

16:53.973 --> 16:55.685
AND I'M ALREADY
GETTING HECKLED.

16:55.685 --> 16:57.517
IT'S JUST LIKE
THE COMMENTS ON THE INTERNET.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.099
I CAN'T DO THIS.

16:59.099 --> 17:00.690
WHAT'S WRONG WITH AVERY?

17:00.690 --> 17:02.642
SHE'S FREAKING OUT
ABOUT SOME HECKLER.

17:02.642 --> 17:05.024
YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE HER
TO SING WHILE I STALL ONSTAGE.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.607
SOUNDS LIKE A JOB
FOR ELLEN JENNINGS,

17:07.607 --> 17:11.281
MILD-MANNERED ALTER EGO
OF DONKEY LAUGH LADY.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.246
- MOM.
- I'LL GO TALK TO HER.

17:16.246 --> 17:18.498
STAN, COME HERE.

17:18.498 --> 17:20.370
WE HAVE TO STALL THE CROWD.

17:20.370 --> 17:22.212
YOU GO INTO THE FOOD TRUCK
WHERE NO ONE CAN SEE YOU,

17:22.212 --> 17:24.214
AND DO SOME FREESTYLIN'.

17:24.214 --> 17:26.216
I'LL LIP SYNC TO IT ONSTAGE.
I CAN'T RAP LIKE YOU.

17:26.216 --> 17:27.967
WELL, TRY TO KEEP UP.

17:27.967 --> 17:30.510
I'M GONNA LAY DOWN
SOME SCIENCE, YO.

17:34.434 --> 17:36.055
ALL RIGHT.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.178
TRUCK STOP'S COMIN' UP
IN A SECOND WITH A SONG

17:38.178 --> 17:39.769
YOU'RE ALL HERE FOR.

17:39.769 --> 17:42.232
BUT FIRST, SOMETHING
NO ONE'S HERE FOR.

17:48.488 --> 17:51.691
Stan: OH, YEAH. MMM.

17:51.691 --> 17:54.324

YOU DON'T WANNA SING

18:24.894 --> 18:26.686
BECAUSE OF SOME HECKLER.

18:26.686 --> 18:28.568
IT'S NOT JUST THE HECKLER.

18:40.830 --> 18:44.083
WELL, THIS IS
VERY HURTFUL.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.586

18:46.586 --> 18:49.209
CAPTAIN DUCKFART?

18:49.209 --> 18:51.841

LAUGH ABOUT THIS?

19:00.220 --> 19:03.223
- THIS IS HORRIBLE.
- ONLY IF YOU LET IT BE.

19:03.223 --> 19:06.356
I MEAN, I JUST FOCUS ON
THE FACT THAT I HAD FUN
DOING THE COMMERCIAL,

19:06.356 --> 19:08.528

WHEN YOU'RE A TEENAGER,
YOU'RE MORE SELF-CONSCIOUS.

HAPPENING WITH YOUR BODY.

19:28.788 --> 19:31.211

19:34.504 --> 19:37.096
YEAH. I DO.
