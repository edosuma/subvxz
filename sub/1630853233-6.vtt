00:17.840 --> 00:19.840
[suspenseful music playing]

00:30.800 --> 00:31.680
[Kate] Both.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.880
I need to work.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.800
And I love you for that.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.360
One way or the other.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.360
Thanks, lovely.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.240
Mrs Whitehouse.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.320
Miss Woodcroft.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.320
Can I help you?

00:58.600 --> 00:59.560
You look familiar.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.280
Well, I should hope so.
I'm prosecuting your husband.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.320
Have we met before?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.560
Not that I recall.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.800
[music fades]

01:08.880 --> 01:10.280
Oh forgive my manners then.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.320
Sophie Whitehouse.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.600
Did you go to Oxford?

01:19.200 --> 01:20.040
Liverpool.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.360
Why are you here, Mrs Whitehouse?

01:26.720 --> 01:29.640
It's just that you look so familiar.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.600
Perhaps we shared a mutual friend.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.000
Did you ever know Holly Berry?

01:37.200 --> 01:40.000
No. I think I'd remember that name.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.200
Did she go to Liverpool?

01:44.480 --> 01:45.360
Oxford.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.600
Well, we really shouldn't be speaking.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.760
Because you're trying to send
my husband to prison?

01:52.840 --> 01:55.320
-It's not personal.
-He's not a rapist.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.800
[Kate] You're certain of that?

01:58.800 --> 02:00.040
I know my husband.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.000
I suspect you do.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.440
[Sophie scoffing]

02:05.800 --> 02:08.560
-So is there anything else?
-Yes.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.000
[tense music playing]

02:11.160 --> 02:12.760
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

[breathing heavily]

03:04.200 --> 03:05.920
[bell ringing]

03:06.640 --> 03:08.200
I'm so sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.120
Do I know you?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.720
[lift bell dinging, door opening]

03:11.800 --> 03:13.360
[breathing heavily]

03:13.440 --> 03:15.200
-I should go.
-You don't mean that.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.160
[Holly] Not here.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.200
[suspenseful music playing]

03:18.840 --> 03:20.960
-Don't be such a prick-tease.
-[Finn] Daddy?

03:21.560 --> 03:22.400
Daddy?

03:23.800 --> 03:24.880
-Daddy.
-[music stops]

03:26.120 --> 03:27.280
I can't sleep.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.440
I can't sleep either.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.200
[sighing]

03:34.280 --> 03:35.320
[Finn] Yes!

03:42.280 --> 03:44.280
[suspenseful music playing]

03:48.520 --> 03:49.560
[sighing heavily]

03:49.640 --> 03:51.280
[knocking on door]

03:52.880 --> 03:53.880
Coming!

03:56.240 --> 03:57.560
[rain pattering]

03:57.640 --> 03:59.800
[sighing] You do realise
this is harassment now?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.120
-Ali, she knows.
-[Ali] Sorry?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.680
Sophie, she knows.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.120
[Ali] Did she actually
come right out and say it?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.320
Pretty much. She knows I'm Holly.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.560
Look, I wasn't there,

04:14.640 --> 04:17.080
but if she did know,
she'd have already told James

04:17.160 --> 04:18.680
and you'd be in handcuffs by now.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.080
What if she has told him?

04:20.160 --> 04:22.200
What if they've gone
directly to the press,

04:22.280 --> 04:23.560
bypassing Angela even?

04:23.640 --> 04:25.560
Okay, now you're sounding a bit paranoid.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.680
And what's he gonna say to the press?

04:27.760 --> 04:30.760
"I'm being prosecuted
by the woman I raped at uni"?

04:30.840 --> 04:34.280
What happens if they've found me out
and I've tried my last case?

04:34.360 --> 04:37.400
-Don't say that.
-Because that would fucking kill me.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.920
[suspenseful music playing]

[door creaking]

06:07.400 --> 06:08.800
[sighing]

06:57.640 --> 06:59.520
-Hey.
-Oh my God.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.680
It's 1:30 in the morning.
Where have you been?

07:04.880 --> 07:05.760
Walking.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.520
Thinking.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.720
[fork clattering]

07:10.800 --> 07:13.400
Things might not go my way tomorrow.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.680
I might go down.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.320
You won't.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.200
[James] You've always defended me.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.440
Stood by me.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.800
I have.

07:34.960 --> 07:35.920
[Sophie sighing]

07:39.840 --> 07:40.800
Holly Berry…

07:42.560 --> 07:44.040
what did she look like?

07:44.720 --> 07:45.640
Why?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.960
When was the last time you saw her?

07:51.160 --> 07:52.600
I thought I saw her today.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.760
Today?

07:54.680 --> 07:55.720
Where?

07:58.160 --> 07:59.360
In the street.

08:01.200 --> 08:05.200
I saw a woman
and I thought, "My God, that's Holly."

08:09.440 --> 08:10.760
It was just my mind…

08:12.840 --> 08:13.800
playing tricks.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.040
[sighing] Please don't hate me, but, um…

08:23.840 --> 08:28.600
the night of the end-of-year
Libertine party…

08:30.800 --> 08:33.240
I might have been with her.

08:35.720 --> 08:36.920
With Holly?

08:39.320 --> 08:42.560
I was running back to your room,

08:42.640 --> 08:48.320
and I collided with a woman
in the cloisters who looked familiar.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.800
Um, just barely. It was dark.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.880
We were both a bit drunk.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.280
And it was…

08:56.000 --> 08:57.560
[exhaling sharply]

08:57.640 --> 08:58.880
…spontaneous.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.200
You were spontaneous?

09:10.760 --> 09:11.760
[Sophie sighing]

09:11.840 --> 09:13.160
Am I to understand

09:14.120 --> 09:17.000
a man jumped, or fell, to his death,

09:18.200 --> 09:19.760
you ran from the scene,

09:20.360 --> 09:24.800
collided with a woman
who looked "barely familiar"…

09:26.880 --> 09:29.480
and proceeded to have sex with her?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.640
Consensual sex.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.200
[Sophie scoffing]

09:34.560 --> 09:35.400
[James] But, um…

09:37.400 --> 09:39.080
But what?

09:39.600 --> 09:40.880
But… [sighing]

09:40.960 --> 09:43.560
Well, afterwards, she… she seemed…

09:46.640 --> 09:47.680
shaken and…

09:50.160 --> 09:51.720
She was a virgin, it turns out.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.440
[dramatic music playing]

09:54.200 --> 09:55.960
[James] And my… my sense of it was that

09:56.480 --> 10:00.160
the encounter fell short
of her romantic expectations.

10:01.720 --> 10:02.560
And I was…

10:04.440 --> 10:05.280
perhaps…

10:07.200 --> 10:08.280
a bit…

10:08.360 --> 10:09.360
Brutish?

10:10.080 --> 10:11.000
Abrupt.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.280
-So, what Chris Clarke said was true.
-[James] Was rubbish.

10:17.440 --> 10:23.400
It was certainly 100% not rape.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.400
And look,
I'm just trying to be honest with myself.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.120
I'm trying to be honest with you.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.560
[crying] But if that was Holly
that I was with,

10:35.640 --> 10:39.640
it is possible that we were not in sync,
and maybe I got it wrong.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.880
I don't wanna hide anything from you.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.560
Oh my God, are you saying there's more?

10:52.640 --> 10:53.840
You know most of it.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.760
I told you about that night
at the Libertine's party.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.560
I just left out one small detail.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.480
What?

11:01.600 --> 11:02.440
Alec,

11:03.520 --> 11:05.760
the one who jumped or fell.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.160
Tom supplied him with the heroin,
and I disposed of the evidence.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.680
That is not a small detail, James.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.280
Alec died.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.640
It was a tragedy, but I lied for Tom.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.320
I lied for you.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.520
I was your alibi the next morning

11:31.080 --> 11:32.840
without knowing the full facts.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.200
I am so, so sorry.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.680
I was protecting you.

11:36.760 --> 11:40.080
-I didn't want you to carry that weight.
-Oh God. I could have decided for myself.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.880
Honestly, Soph, you didn't seem
that interested in the full set of facts.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.000
[Sophie scoffing]

11:49.280 --> 11:50.680
All of your stories

11:52.280 --> 11:53.480
keep changing.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.320
I've told you everything now.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.360
There is nothing else.

12:00.960 --> 12:01.800
I swear it.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.000
[suspenseful music playing]

12:15.080 --> 12:16.240
[James] Miss Woodcroft.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.440
[judge] Miss Woodcroft.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.360
Thank you, My Lord.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.040
One of them is lying.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.200
You are here to determine the truth.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.760
Miss Lytton has given you an account
of a crime that was committed against her,

12:32.840 --> 12:36.800
in a lift in the House of Commons
on the morning of the 12th of October.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.880
A violent rape.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.240
Mr Whitehouse has told you
a different story.

12:43.320 --> 12:47.000
Two narratives that start off the same
and then diverge.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.760
Did she or he call the lift?

12:48.840 --> 12:51.120
Did she or he enter the lift first?

12:51.200 --> 12:53.720
Did she or he initiate the kiss?

12:54.240 --> 12:58.240
And then one crucial,
glaring, irreconcilable difference.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.720
One of them is lying.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.600
At the beginning of this trial,

13:04.680 --> 13:08.480
I said that Miss Lytton's journey
in the lift was one from yes to no.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.200
Yes, when they were kissing,

13:11.160 --> 13:14.440
and no as soon as Mr Whitehouse
became violent.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.840
"Not here" means "no."

13:20.000 --> 13:21.800
Whatever the defence suggests,

13:21.880 --> 13:25.880
it was a clear indication that Miss Lytton
did not want to continue.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.280
He called her a prick-tease.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.960
Why would she lie about that?

13:32.040 --> 13:33.520
She didn't.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.360
He raped her

13:37.280 --> 13:38.560
in black and white.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.160
I know you'll not make
the mistake of thinking

13:41.240 --> 13:44.240
that different rules
apply to the rich and powerful.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.120
That people who aren't used to the word no

13:47.200 --> 13:49.560
should be exempt from hearing it.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.280
That their liberties are different.

13:52.880 --> 13:57.120
Members of the jury, I think we know
exactly which one of them is lying.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.040
People of privilege can no more
break the law without consequence

14:01.120 --> 14:02.280
than anyone else.

14:03.600 --> 14:09.200
James Whitehouse's privilege
does not extend to rape.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.400
[judge] Miss Regan.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.960
Did James Whitehouse
commit rape or make love?

14:23.560 --> 14:26.920
The answer to that question
can be found in only one place,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.160
the evidence.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.280
So let's look at the evidence.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.240
I'm going to start
with what they agreed on.

14:33.920 --> 14:38.200
They had engaged in spontaneous sex
several times before.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.720
Aggressive consensual sex.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.200
On the day in question,

14:43.280 --> 14:48.280
after Miss Lytton told Mr Whitehouse
she found his arrogance attractive,

14:48.360 --> 14:51.200
they enter the lift
and began to passionately kiss.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.640
All consensual and not in dispute.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.400
Now, let's look at
what they don't agree on.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.640
Miss Lytton claims there came a point
when she became unwilling.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.120
But how can a person here know

15:05.320 --> 15:06.800
when it hasn't been said?

15:06.880 --> 15:10.480
Mr Whitehouse maintains
he never heard "not here."

15:11.120 --> 15:12.440
But even if she did say it,

15:12.520 --> 15:15.360
"not here" does not mean "no."

15:16.080 --> 15:17.760
It does not mean unwilling.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.480
In fact, it might be taken
to communicate "yes,"

15:21.560 --> 15:23.640
just not here

15:24.560 --> 15:25.840
in this location.

15:26.880 --> 15:31.160
Why would James Whitehouse
force himself upon Olivia Lytton,

15:31.240 --> 15:32.720
a woman who still loved him,

15:32.800 --> 15:35.440
a woman who was willing
to resume the relationship?

15:35.520 --> 15:37.120
Something she told us herself.

15:37.200 --> 15:42.080
Why rape a woman
who was willing to have sex with him?

15:43.680 --> 15:45.960
The simple answer is he didn't.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.080
James Whitehouse had an affair.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.680
But an affair is not a crime.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.440
It is not for the defence
to supply a motive

15:57.520 --> 15:59.640
for Miss Lytton's lies.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.520
Perhaps she felt embarrassed,

16:03.120 --> 16:07.080
or ashamed, or even angry.

16:07.160 --> 16:11.520
But shame, anger, humiliation

16:11.600 --> 16:16.000
should not have the power
to convert consensual sex

16:16.960 --> 16:18.160
into rape.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.760
[dramatic music playing]

16:26.400 --> 16:27.360
[door opening]

16:30.800 --> 16:32.600
[Kate breathing heavily]

16:37.400 --> 16:39.280
[unnerving music playing]

16:44.160 --> 16:45.080
[door opening]

16:45.160 --> 16:48.240
[Angela] 1,753, that's more like it.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.680
So you got it fixed then?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.840
[Angela] No. They replaced it.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.840
Turns out the old one was defective.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.160
A "Shitbit" as it were.

17:01.840 --> 17:06.120
"Did James Whitehouse
commit rape or make love?"

17:07.160 --> 17:08.120
Not bad, Angela.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.160
[Angela chuckling]

17:09.240 --> 17:12.400
I enjoyed your use
of "privileged" and 'liberties"

17:12.480 --> 17:13.680
in the same sentence.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
Trying to invoke
the Libertine club, weren't you?

17:20.520 --> 17:21.560
Oh, honestly,

17:22.600 --> 17:26.680
sometimes, I can't believe
I spend my life defending these people.

17:26.760 --> 17:27.600
[Kate] Ugh.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.280
[both sighing]

17:32.880 --> 17:34.480
Time to be done with this case.

17:39.880 --> 17:40.720
[dog barking]

17:41.280 --> 17:42.240
[Sophie] Hello.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.960
[Finn speaking indistinctly]

17:48.160 --> 17:49.240
[Finn] Oh this works.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.520
[Emily] As long as you can't see it.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.720
Where's Daddy?

17:52.800 --> 17:54.320
[Sophie] He's still at court.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.920
-Have they had lunch?
-Yes.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.280
-Did we win?
-Not yet.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.600
But we will, because we're Whitehouses.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.080
Where are you going?

18:05.160 --> 18:07.120
Just outside for a bit of fresh air.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.360
[Finn] Why?

18:08.440 --> 18:09.560
Air is crucial.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.080
What's "crucial"?

18:11.160 --> 18:13.440
It means we can't survive
if we can't breathe.

18:14.680 --> 18:15.680
I'll be back.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
[dramatic music playing]

18:26.440 --> 18:27.440
What?

18:28.600 --> 18:29.640
Nothing.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.760
[birds chirping]

18:46.680 --> 18:47.520
[lighter clicking]

19:00.440 --> 19:01.560

19:06.320 --> 19:08.320
[suspenseful music playing]

19:20.640 --> 19:22.640
[police siren wailing]

19:24.800 --> 19:27.200
[Maggie] There you are.
They're calling us back.

19:27.720 --> 19:28.600
Already?

19:29.320 --> 19:30.360
Four hours?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.120
Must be sending them home.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.640
There's a verdict.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.040
I saw the note come in.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.280
You all right?

19:41.480 --> 19:42.400
Never better.

19:52.480 --> 19:53.560
[bell ringing]

19:53.640 --> 19:55.640
[suspenseful music swelling]

20:03.640 --> 20:04.920

20:09.560 --> 20:11.560
[tense music playing]

20:27.360 --> 20:29.040
[sighing heavily]

20:34.800 --> 20:36.000
[clerk] Jury foreperson,

20:37.080 --> 20:40.160
please answer my next question
either "yes" or "no."

20:41.880 --> 20:44.800
Has the jury reached a verdict
on which you are all agreed?

20:45.320 --> 20:46.160
Yes.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.760
Will the defendant please rise?

21:00.600 --> 21:03.760
Do you find the defendant,
James Whitehouse,

21:04.280 --> 21:07.040
guilty or not guilty

21:07.120 --> 21:08.960
on the count of rape?

21:09.040 --> 21:11.280
[high-pitched whirring]

21:16.480 --> 21:17.840
Not guilty.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.640
[gasping]

21:19.720 --> 21:21.320
[scattered murmuring]

21:32.280 --> 21:33.400
[judge] Members of the jury,

21:33.920 --> 21:36.280
it only remains for me to thank you

21:36.360 --> 21:39.400
for your careful deliberations
in this matter.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.520
That's our boy.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.280
Dodged another bullet, didn't he?

21:44.360 --> 21:45.200
[chuckling]

21:47.760 --> 21:48.760
[door opening]

21:48.840 --> 21:54.280
[judge] We understand that your service
comes with genuine personal sacrifice.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.040
You leave with our gratitude.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.200
The jury is dismissed.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.120
Mr Whitehouse, you are free to go.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.000
[clerk] All rise.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.360
[indistinct chatter]

22:30.040 --> 22:32.120
-[James] Thank you.
-[Angela] My pleasure.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.680
[suspenseful music playing]

22:41.320 --> 22:42.520
[bell ringing]

22:48.640 --> 22:50.080
[bell ringing]

23:10.760 --> 23:12.760
[journalists clamouring]

23:13.520 --> 23:14.560
[journalist] Mr Whitehouse!

23:18.400 --> 23:19.960
I'm… I'm gonna keep this really brief.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.000
I just want to thank the women and men
of the jury for seeing the truth.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.920
For recognising my innocence.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.680
Justice has prevailed.

23:26.760 --> 23:30.080
It's been a long, long uphill climb,

23:30.160 --> 23:32.400
but I got my life back.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.040
I'm a grateful man.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.920
To my children, my loving wife,

23:38.800 --> 23:42.280
these last few months
have been a living hell for my family,

23:42.360 --> 23:45.120
and I want to thank them
for standing by me unequivocally.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.240
-[high-pitched whirring]
-[Sophie shuddering]

23:47.320 --> 23:48.800
[James] The facts have spoken.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.840
The British judicial system
has once again proven its sturdiness…

23:51.920 --> 23:53.920
[Sophie breathing heavily]

23:56.480 --> 23:58.040
[exhaling slowly, gasping]

23:58.120 --> 23:59.400
[journalist] Mr Whitehouse!

24:01.160 --> 24:02.600
[journalists clamouring]

24:02.680 --> 24:04.040
[camera shutters clicking]

24:05.240 --> 24:06.480
[Emily] Daddy!

24:06.560 --> 24:08.040
-[Finn] Daddy!
-[Emily] Daddy!

24:08.120 --> 24:09.200
[Finn] Dad!

24:09.280 --> 24:10.600
Hello, you. Hey.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.200
-[Emily] Are you home for good?
-I am.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.760
I am, my darlings.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.680
-[Finn] Mummy, hug, too?
-Hi, sweetie.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.320
-Hi.
-I'm starving. You guys?

24:17.400 --> 24:18.480
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.120
[footsteps receding]

24:23.960 --> 24:25.120
[James] Justice has prevailed.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.520
It's been a long, long uphill climb,

24:29.600 --> 24:32.080
but I got my life back.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.200
I'm a grateful man.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.760
To my children, my loving wife,

24:35.840 --> 24:39.160
these last few months
have been a living hell for my family…

24:39.240 --> 24:40.800
[intense music playing]

24:41.880 --> 24:42.720
[Kate] Fuck!

24:43.320 --> 24:44.160
Fucker!

24:46.240 --> 24:47.880
[doorbell ringing]

24:53.720 --> 24:55.160
[Kate breathing heavily]

24:57.800 --> 24:58.640
[screaming]

25:08.360 --> 25:09.600
Kate?

25:09.680 --> 25:10.560
[Kate crying]

25:10.640 --> 25:12.080
[melancholy music playing]

25:16.120 --> 25:17.520
[inaudible]

25:33.680 --> 25:36.480
Hours after a rumoured
motion of no confidence

25:36.560 --> 25:38.800
in Prime Minister Tom Southern's
government,

25:38.880 --> 25:41.760
Malcolm Thwaites, Labour MP for Penthorpe,

25:41.840 --> 25:45.840
has been arrested for soliciting
young male prostitutes for sex.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.600
This isn't the first time
Malcolm Thwaites…

25:47.680 --> 25:50.320
[James] The impeccable timing
of one Chris Clarke.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.280
How do you know?

25:51.360 --> 25:52.920
Just got off the phone with Tom.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.600
Now that we've regained our sure footing,

25:54.680 --> 25:56.480
he's bringing me back
into the Home Office.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.600
Undersecretary of State
in charge of drugs policy.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.120
-Are you joking?
-[James] No.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.640
[scoffing] Do you remember when I said
your luck had run out?

26:05.320 --> 26:06.440
How wrong I was.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.800
You sound a bit ambivalent, darling.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.360
[Sophie] Impressed.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.080
It's almost like you're being rewarded.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.160
Rewarded, no. Restored.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.960
-To the future.
-[glasses clank]

26:18.680 --> 26:20.760
Omertà of the Libertines.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.160
Tell me the truth, darling.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.680
Did you say it?

26:27.400 --> 26:30.120
Did you say,
"Don't be such a prick-tease"?

26:30.200 --> 26:31.840
I answered that question in court.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.440
I heard your answer in court.
I'm asking you here, now.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.560
Did you say it?

26:36.320 --> 26:37.240
What do you think?

26:38.800 --> 26:40.360
[tense music playing]

26:40.880 --> 26:43.200
I think it's possible
Olivia asked you to stop.

26:44.120 --> 26:46.080
That you decided she didn't mean it.

26:47.400 --> 26:51.080
That you said,
"Don't be such a prick-tease", joking,

26:52.280 --> 26:53.400
but also not joking.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.640
Because it sounds like something
you would say.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.040
You said it.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.000
Of course she didn't mean it.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.840
It was a game we perfected.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.680
You can't possibly know that.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.160
I can and I do.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.840
Olivia loved risky situations.
We both did.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.400
The idea we might get caught.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.280
-Oh my God.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.720
That is not what you said in court.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.440
I couldn't stay that. How would it look?

27:23.040 --> 27:25.760
You testified that it was a foul phrase.

27:25.840 --> 27:26.680
It is.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.600
I told the core truth,

27:29.280 --> 27:31.120
which is that she wanted it.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.560
The core truth is that I would never,
ever force myself on a woman.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.280
[footsteps receding]

27:46.480 --> 27:47.560
[breathing heavily]

27:57.520 --> 27:58.960
That's great. Thank you so much.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.720
-Keep the change.
-[driver] Thank you.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.400
[Ali] Okay. Good night.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.360
[car engine revving]

28:10.200 --> 28:11.320
-Alison?
-[gasping]

28:11.400 --> 28:12.240
Jesus!

28:12.320 --> 28:13.840
-I'm sorry.
-[Ali gasping]

28:13.920 --> 28:15.120
It's Sophie Whitehouse.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.440
Greenaway, at university.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.200
Sophie.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.080
I'm so sorry
for showing up like this at this hour.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.400
I know it's been-- It's been a while.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.280
Well, I would ask,
uh, "How's things?" but…

28:29.360 --> 28:30.240
Yeah.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.840
-Do you want to come in?
-[Sophie] Thank you.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.680
No, this won't take long, um…

28:37.720 --> 28:39.080
I'm trying to find someone.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.040
Holly Berry.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.360
I thought maybe you could help.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.320
Uh,

28:46.080 --> 28:48.240
I'm not in touch with anyone from Oxford.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.520
I more or less cut ties.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.960
And they don't bother to contact me,
because I'm just a schoolteacher

28:54.040 --> 28:55.760
and ill-equipped to fund science wings.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.320
But you and Holly were very close.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.200
Oh we were. Yes.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.880
Do you have any idea where she is?

29:04.960 --> 29:05.800
No.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.480
[sighing] Do you know anyone who might?

29:11.560 --> 29:13.880
-I wish I could help. Sorry.
-Do you?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.920
Look, I told you. She's gone.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.360
Gone?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.440
Gone because Holly Berry
is Kate Woodcroft?

29:21.520 --> 29:22.480
No.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.480
Uh… [scoffing]

29:23.560 --> 29:25.000
No, you're mistaken.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.280
I just don't know where she is.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.280
We drifted apart
after she moved back to Liverpool.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.680
Thank you for your help.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.400
[tense music playing]

29:37.920 --> 29:39.480
Why do you want to find her?

29:40.600 --> 29:42.000
I need to ask her something.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.640
The answer's yes.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.440
[suspenseful music playing]

29:58.560 --> 29:59.640
What?

29:59.720 --> 30:01.880
I tried to tell her she was wrong.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.000
But you're a shit liar.
You always have been.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.160
I'm sorry.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.600
[Kate] No, it's my fault. I'm fucked.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.360
I can't kill Kate and can't deny Holly.
I'm fully fucked.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.880
Her husband is a rapist, and she knows it.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.000
[breathing heavily]

30:17.520 --> 30:18.680
I'll call you back.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.720
Look I know it's late,
but I really need to speak to you.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.400
[crying]

30:48.880 --> 30:49.720
[Richard] Kate?

30:49.800 --> 30:50.960
[Kate scoffing]

30:51.040 --> 30:52.360
That's not my name.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.800
What are you talking about?

30:58.240 --> 30:59.200
What's going on?

31:00.920 --> 31:03.080
I did something terrible. Unethical.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.000
[Richard] Like what?

31:05.160 --> 31:07.600
I prosecuted
someone I knew in another life.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.080
-Sounds a bit dramatic.
-It's the truth.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.520
[Kate sniffling]

31:13.600 --> 31:15.200
Are you talking about Whitehouse?

31:18.200 --> 31:19.240
You knew him?

31:20.360 --> 31:21.400
[crying]

31:21.480 --> 31:22.360
At uni.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.560
He assaulted me,

31:26.520 --> 31:29.200
when I went by a different name
and looked like a different person.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.120
What?

31:33.520 --> 31:34.360
Christ.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.480
-Does he know who you are?
-I don't know.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.560
But I think so.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.840
-Should I confess?
-No, you'd end your career.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.960
Better to do it before he does.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.440
If he outs you, he outs himself.
That's mutually assured destruction.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.320
-I'm a fucking liar.
-[Richard] Kate.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.120
-Just like him.
-Stop it.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.160
It's true.
You don't even know me, not really.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.280
[Kate crying]

31:56.360 --> 31:58.320
[melancholy music playing]

31:58.400 --> 31:59.240
[Kate] I--

31:59.320 --> 32:00.240
[sniffling]

32:04.040 --> 32:06.200
[sighing] I can't do this anymore.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.960
You mean this?

32:19.800 --> 32:21.120
[Richard groaning]

32:23.680 --> 32:24.720
[crying]

32:27.120 --> 32:28.640
I may leave her one day.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.800
[Kate] But the truth is,

32:29.880 --> 32:32.760
I chose you because you're unavailable.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.960
I need to stop doing that.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.760
I see.

32:45.640 --> 32:46.760
Do I go to the judge?

32:46.840 --> 32:48.760
-And say what?
-[Kate] Do I get a lawyer?

32:48.840 --> 32:50.080
Will you be my lawyer?

32:50.680 --> 32:52.880
No, you can't be my lawyer.
I've fucked up.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.040
[sobbing]

32:59.160 --> 33:00.160
[sobbing, sniffling]

33:01.920 --> 33:03.000
[James] Sussex?

33:03.600 --> 33:05.160
Why are you taking them there?

33:06.520 --> 33:08.560
-Because I'm leaving you.
-What?

33:08.640 --> 33:09.960
No. Now?

33:10.440 --> 33:13.320
But, Sophie, why? We've been in hell,
but we've come through that.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.080
-I… I don't understand.
-I know.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.040
What… what can I do?

33:17.120 --> 33:17.960
Nothing.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.120
Don't be smug, Sophie.
You owe me more than that for God's sake.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.880
Smug? Me?

33:23.840 --> 33:25.640
That is not how I feel, James.

33:26.440 --> 33:30.080
I've been a part of it too, complicit,
and I hate myself for it.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.760
For what? You're speaking in riddles.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.360
For the way I've always let you
curate the truth.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.120
Pick and choose details

33:38.200 --> 33:40.560
so they were aligned with the world
as you preferred it to be.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.640
It's like a toy for you, the truth.

33:43.400 --> 33:47.400
And you play with it through elisions,
omissions, and half-truths.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.920
You can't help yourself.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.760
-Everybody does that.
-Everybody bloody doesn't.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.640
I turned a blind eye all these years

33:54.720 --> 33:57.120
because I always thought
I alone got the real thing from you.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.080
I feel

33:59.600 --> 34:03.960
foolish and so ashamed, honestly.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.800
But you did get the real thing.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.800
-[Sophie] Oh God.
-This is it.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.800
This is the real me.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.560
I am sorry if it didn't--

34:12.560 --> 34:13.880
No one knows me like you.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.240
I love you, Soph.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.920
-Do you want me to beg?
-Please don't.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.320
I'm begging you.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.040
[Sophie] Don't.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.920
Oh don't. James.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.600
I don't know who the fuck you are anymore.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.400
And I don't know who the fuck I am,

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
because I always define myself
through you.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.600
I can't stay.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.480
Because if I do,
who will our children become?

34:45.560 --> 34:47.880
Exactly who they were born to become.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.800
[dramatic music playing]

34:57.680 --> 35:00.040
[whispering] Please don't tell me
I've lost you.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.200
May I ask

35:09.720 --> 35:11.840
what you're planning to tell the children?

35:17.680 --> 35:18.800
The core truth.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.320
[music fades]

35:44.840 --> 35:46.600

[indistinct chatter]

36:20.360 --> 36:21.600
[music stops]

36:23.400 --> 36:25.360
Do you know what finally gave you away?

36:26.240 --> 36:29.920
Your left-handed scribbling
and your colour-coded notes.

36:31.000 --> 36:31.840
[Kate] Hmm.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.240
[Sophie] It is remarkable though.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.200
What?

36:36.280 --> 36:38.680
The ways in which you are unrecognisable.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.520
You don't look the same,
you don't sound the same.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.600
You go by some made-up name.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.520
Not made-up.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.000
My middle name,
plus my ex-husband's surname.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.560
What were you running away from?

36:55.960 --> 36:57.240
Why did you wanna meet me?

36:59.880 --> 37:00.720
James.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.640
At Oxford, you fancied him.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.880
[Kate] He assaulted me.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.920
He said it was consensual.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.960
He assaulted me.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.160
Why didn't you report it to the police?

37:16.240 --> 37:18.400
Who do you think they would have believed?

37:18.480 --> 37:20.200
I didn't stand a chance.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.160
It was rape.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.720
You know, I often wonder
what it must be like

37:30.800 --> 37:34.520
to know that however you behave,
you will always be excused and forgiven.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.360
I had no idea at the time.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.760
You have to believe me, I did not know.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.840
Well, now you do.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.360
What are you suggesting?

37:43.440 --> 37:45.840
Do you still expect me
to do your homework for you,

37:45.920 --> 37:47.480
two decades on?

37:50.040 --> 37:54.320
I have been simultaneously
over and underestimated my entire life.

37:56.040 --> 38:00.320
If I have traded on the currency
that the world told me was mine, well…

38:02.040 --> 38:04.080
that's what I was raised to do.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.680
But don't for a second assume I am unaware

38:06.760 --> 38:08.960
of the personal cost
of those transactions.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.720
[tense music playing]

38:11.560 --> 38:13.360
A lot of people think they know me.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.000
You think you know me.

38:17.240 --> 38:18.840
Trust me, you don't.

38:22.480 --> 38:25.080
What about you?
Who are you, Holly or Kate?

38:27.280 --> 38:28.720
I guess I'm finally both.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.480
Listen, are you gonna expose me?

38:39.720 --> 38:42.560
That night he raped you…

38:44.360 --> 38:47.680
was the same night that one
of the Libertines fell to their death.

38:47.760 --> 38:48.840
I remember.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.640
It was the only time
I'd ever seen him cry.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.720
Huh. Well, I doubt his tears
were anything to do with me.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.720
No.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.480
They were because
he'd come dangerously close

38:59.560 --> 39:01.600
to destroying his golden future.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.560
What are you talking about?

39:05.360 --> 39:06.760
I made a call today

39:07.600 --> 39:09.280
to an acquaintance in the press.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.840
A lot of horrible things
happened that night,

39:12.920 --> 39:14.760
aside from what happened to you.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.520
Something that could be
prosecuted in court?

39:21.000 --> 39:21.840
Yes.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.320
Why are you doing this?

39:26.880 --> 39:28.440
Course correction, perhaps,

39:29.800 --> 39:31.080
for the greater good.

39:33.640 --> 39:36.280
Her Majesty's government
is about to implode.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.360
Merry Christmas, Holly Berry.
