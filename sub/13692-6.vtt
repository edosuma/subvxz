00:37.915 --> 00:40.793
Welcome to Glenbogle,
heart of the Highlands.

00:40.877 --> 00:44.130
-I take it you're
working for Stella.
-Sorry?

00:44.213 --> 00:45.923
She's always been great at
motivating people

00:46.007 --> 00:48.301
but getting them
to stand out in traffic...

00:48.384 --> 00:53.181
She's really excelled herself.
We're here, Henry. Drive on.

00:56.351 --> 00:58.353
DUNCAN:
He said he was a colleague.

00:58.436 --> 01:01.189
A colleague wouldn't drop by
in a chauffeur-driven Jag.

01:01.272 --> 01:03.733
If you ask me,
that's her boss.

01:03.816 --> 01:05.902
LEXIE: I'll bet he's giving
her a rocket.

01:05.985 --> 01:09.280
Well, if she's in trouble,
we're all in trouble.

01:09.364 --> 01:12.992
It's a family business,
they're a little
set in their ways.

01:13.076 --> 01:16.245
Well, that's why we
sent you here, Stella,
to teach them some new ways.

01:16.329 --> 01:20.750
You're meant to beat this lot,
not join them. It would be
a shame to go native.

01:20.833 --> 01:25.129
Up here on your own
with all this fresh
air and fine scenery.

01:25.213 --> 01:28.633
-I hadn't noticed.
-I'll be back in a week.

01:28.716 --> 01:33.096
You ought to have something
worth showing me by then.
Give them hell.

02:21.060 --> 02:23.730
The bridge has been
open for three weeks.

02:23.813 --> 02:27.483
Since that time each of you
has had an income
target to achieve

02:27.567 --> 02:31.320
and I want to hear
progress reports. Molly.

02:31.403 --> 02:34.407
Short breaks for people
who want to
paint watercolours?

02:34.490 --> 02:36.534
Ah, yes.

02:36.616 --> 02:41.456
Well, I, um, I built a
subsection on the website with
an automated response routine

02:41.539 --> 02:47.378
and, er, I filled in lots of
bumf about the friendly staff
and hands-on activities.

02:47.462 --> 02:50.548
-And how many
replies have you had?
-Just one.

02:50.631 --> 02:54.927
A chap who thought we
were a massage parlour.

02:55.011 --> 02:59.849
Oh, yes, that's hilarious.
Almost as funny as
the cash flow figures.

02:59.932 --> 03:03.644
Duncan, your job was
to promote Glenbogle

03:03.727 --> 03:06.481
locally as
a tourist destination.

03:07.899 --> 03:10.318
Right. Yes, erm...

03:11.569 --> 03:14.405
I'm still evaluating

03:14.489 --> 03:17.283
the most cost
effective approach

03:18.576 --> 03:23.331
for enhancing
the ongoing thingy.

03:23.414 --> 03:26.793
You mean you're still out
there waving like a loony
at passing cars? Great.

03:26.876 --> 03:30.755
Well, if you get run over,
it'll save me the bother
of firing you. Hector!

03:32.632 --> 03:34.676
-Sorry?
-Have you even been listening?

03:34.759 --> 03:38.179
Not really, no.
You seem to be
discussing commerce.

03:38.262 --> 03:42.809
A gentleman does not sully
himself with anything so
vulgar as trade.

03:42.892 --> 03:45.520
As the eldest surviving
member of MacDonalds,

03:45.603 --> 03:48.731
I have the dignity of
the clan to consider.

03:48.815 --> 03:54.904
And how much dignity will you
or your clan have when you're
living in a caravan park?

03:54.987 --> 03:59.409
Look, maybe I
haven't made myself clear.
Time's up.

03:59.492 --> 04:03.788
Either we see some
results this week
or I go back to a desk job

04:03.871 --> 04:07.542
and Glenbogle goes
under the hammer.
It's that simple.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.752
-Archie.
-Okay.

04:09.836 --> 04:13.798
I've been in touch with
several national newspapers
trying to stoke up interest

04:13.881 --> 04:16.259
in Glenbogle as
a tourist destination,

04:16.341 --> 04:18.720
which is why we have a
journalist from

04:18.803 --> 04:21.764
the Sunday Courier arriving
this evening.

04:21.848 --> 04:25.058
We have two days to show him
what we have to offer.

04:25.143 --> 04:28.186
This is our chance
to really put
Glenbogle on the map.

04:28.271 --> 04:30.565
A good write-up from him
will not only
impress the bank,

04:30.648 --> 04:34.110
but it'll give
us more business
than we can handle.

04:34.193 --> 04:36.738
That's excellent, Archie.
Thank you.

04:38.614 --> 04:42.827
Now, I shouldn't have
to say this but I will.

04:42.910 --> 04:45.788
We treat this
guy like royalty.

04:45.872 --> 04:49.167
Anything he wants, he gets.

04:49.250 --> 04:53.254
And if that means
a piggyback up Ben Bogle,
you all form an orderly queue.

04:53.338 --> 04:57.550
-What's his name?
-Um, Lawrence.
Graham Lawrence.

04:59.135 --> 05:00.511
Graham Lawrence?

05:17.195 --> 05:19.364
-Oh. Graham.
-How did you know it was me?

05:19.447 --> 05:21.657
-Welcome to Glenbogle.
-It's magnificent.

05:21.741 --> 05:24.827
Best-kept secret in the
Highlands. Here's hoping it
doesn't stay that way.

05:24.911 --> 05:27.497
Thanks for coming to meet me.
I would have caught the bus.

05:27.580 --> 05:30.124
Oh, don't worry, the next
one's not till Tuesday.

05:40.009 --> 05:41.803
Oh, Duncan.

05:44.472 --> 05:45.765
Cheer up.

05:47.266 --> 05:49.811
Think positively.

05:49.894 --> 05:54.482
I am. I'm thinking I'm
positively crap at this job.

05:54.565 --> 05:58.444
(SIGHING) So Stella
gave you a ticking off.
She gave me one, too.

05:58.528 --> 06:02.782
-We've just got to
get those visitors in.
-Or what?

06:02.865 --> 06:05.952
Thanks for trying,
Molly, but let's face it,

06:07.327 --> 06:10.415
she can hardly
sack you, can she?

06:10.498 --> 06:14.168
Ah, this is my father,
Hector MacDonald.
Graham Lawrence.

06:14.252 --> 06:16.087
-Delighted.
-Ah, heard you were coming.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.840
Now what can we get you?
A crate of something
or do you prefer cash?

06:18.923 --> 06:21.050
-Father, please.
-Well, this is the journalist,
isn't it?

06:21.134 --> 06:23.678
Yes, but that
doesn't necessarily mean
he's open to bribery.

06:23.761 --> 06:25.805
But please don't let
that stop you from trying.

06:25.888 --> 06:29.517
-Well, let's soften you
up with a glass of malt.
-Sounds great.

06:31.019 --> 06:33.271
And this is our housekeeper,
Lexie.

06:33.354 --> 06:35.440
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:35.523 --> 06:38.651
Hello! You're Graham?

06:38.735 --> 06:43.156
I'll put him in the Ben
Nevis suite. Big double bed.
Plenty of room to manoeuvre.

06:43.239 --> 06:46.993
(CHOKING AND COUGHING)

06:47.076 --> 06:50.496
-Father, are you all right?
-Oh, fine.

06:50.580 --> 06:54.792
I've been poisoned.
This isn't a single malt,
it's boiled bog water!

06:54.876 --> 06:58.420
Actually it's Supersaver
Blended. 7.99 a bottle.

06:58.504 --> 07:01.466
Oh, yes, this is Stella Moon,
our financial controller.

07:01.548 --> 07:04.927
-Lucretia Borgia
to her friends.
-Stella.

07:05.011 --> 07:08.514
-Hello, Graham.
Fancy meeting you here.
-You know each other?

07:08.598 --> 07:09.932
-Yes.
-No.

07:10.016 --> 07:11.642
Sort of.

07:11.726 --> 07:13.519
We're married.

07:13.603 --> 07:16.606
Separated. We'd be divorced
but Graham can't
spell his own name.

07:16.689 --> 07:20.485
What is this, an ambush? Are
you planning to throw me in a
dungeon and feed me on scraps?

07:20.568 --> 07:24.739
Sadly, I'm not in
charge of your accommodation.

07:24.822 --> 07:29.327
Mmm, married.
Funny she never
mentioned that, eh, Arch?

07:29.410 --> 07:33.873
It was a whirlwind romance.
Marry at Gretna Green,
repent at Carlisle.

07:33.956 --> 07:37.919
-I thought she was
working for a bank.
-Yeah, she is.

07:38.002 --> 07:41.255
I'm sorry, Graham,
we really had no idea.
This must be terribly awkward.

07:41.339 --> 07:46.219
Oh, no, please. I'm here to do
a job. You must treat me
like any other visitor

07:46.302 --> 07:49.555
who's just met his
wife for the first time
in three years.

07:49.639 --> 07:52.725
-Any chance of that whisky?
-I'm sorry, I'm afraid not.

07:52.809 --> 07:54.936
I'm using it to
clean the lavatory.

08:00.982 --> 08:03.319
Yes, I'm married. I used to
wear a ring,

08:03.403 --> 08:06.239
but I accidentally threw
it off the Forth Bridge.

08:06.322 --> 08:09.158
You knew who was coming
as soon as I
mentioned his name.

08:09.242 --> 08:11.285
I was hoping it was gonna be
a different Graham Lawrence.

08:11.369 --> 08:12.954
Well,
it isn't, it's your husband.

08:13.037 --> 08:14.956
And since you didn't warn me,
we're stuck with him.

08:15.039 --> 08:17.834
-So what would you have done?
-Put him off.

08:17.917 --> 08:21.379
Told him we'd got the dates
mixed up, got bubonic plague,
I don't know.

08:21.462 --> 08:24.340
-Just to spare my feelings?
-No, to spare his.

08:24.424 --> 08:26.384
Oh.

08:26.467 --> 08:28.094
Look, whatever went
on between you two,
it's none of my business.

08:28.177 --> 08:30.805
But this is about Glenbogle.
Be polite to him.

08:30.888 --> 08:33.390
I'm sure he'll do his best
to be objective.

08:33.474 --> 08:35.183
He seems like a really
decent sort of bloke.

08:35.268 --> 08:39.147
Oh,
you're not a very good judge
of character then, are you?

08:39.230 --> 08:40.857
Obviously not.

08:47.447 --> 08:50.907
That was an amazing dinner.
I'm looking forward
to this haggis flambe.

08:50.992 --> 08:54.495
-Sorry,
Stella's rationed the brandy.
-That's our Stella.

08:54.578 --> 08:58.374
-Always had to
keep a lid on the fun.
-Here we go.

09:00.585 --> 09:03.504
-Can I help you?
-Oops. I must have
got the rooms mixed up.

09:03.588 --> 09:05.631
Understandable,
I've only been here
two months.

09:05.715 --> 09:08.426
Tell you what, why don't
you two just share?

09:08.509 --> 09:11.304
I mean, seeing as you're here
and, oh, you're married.

09:11.387 --> 09:13.181
Are we short of rooms
suddenly?

09:13.264 --> 09:16.809
Just trying to save on
laundry bills. Never mind.

09:18.811 --> 09:20.938
-So this was
your idea, was it?
-Oh, yeah.

09:21.022 --> 09:23.816
Weekends away with
someone you hate,
they're the next big thing.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.403
You know, I still have
your picture by my bed.
Scares off burglars.

09:27.487 --> 09:30.365
Well, I used to have
a little statue of you
but I threw it away

09:30.448 --> 09:32.325
'cause I couldn't fit
any more pins into it.

09:32.408 --> 09:35.411
I didn't know country pursuits
included sniping
and unarmed combat.

09:35.495 --> 09:38.873
Well, if ignorance is bliss,
Graham, you must be
the happiest man alive.

09:38.956 --> 09:41.292
Shut the door when you leave.

09:56.099 --> 09:59.894
Yes! A booking
for a party of five.

09:59.977 --> 10:02.063
Oh, for the year after next.

10:02.146 --> 10:05.233
Oh, that's hardly gonna
impress Stella, is it?

10:13.449 --> 10:15.660
-Oh, Holy Mother of...
-What?

10:15.743 --> 10:20.665
Oh, just the advertising
rates for the local paper.
I mean, nobody reads it.

10:20.748 --> 10:22.417
They just use it
to wrap chips in.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.085
Can't you afford
an advertisement?

10:24.168 --> 10:27.046
Oh, aye, maybe,
if I sell a kidney.

10:27.130 --> 10:28.840
Well, you'll just have to ask
Stella for the money.

10:30.091 --> 10:32.010
I think I'd
rather sell the kidney.

10:33.052 --> 10:34.345
LEXIE: I'll get that.

10:34.429 --> 10:36.014
-GRAHAM: I can manage, Lexie.
-No.

10:36.097 --> 10:38.850
You're rushed off
your feet as it is.

10:38.933 --> 10:40.935
There we are.

10:41.019 --> 10:45.857
-Now, would you
like more of anything?
-I'd like more of everything.

10:45.940 --> 10:48.735
The food is just fabulous.

10:48.818 --> 10:51.696
And, um, did you sleep well?
Bed not too lumpy?

10:51.779 --> 10:56.242
It was a bit big. And empty.

10:56.325 --> 10:58.953
So Stella didn't pay you
any midnight visits, then?

10:59.037 --> 11:04.208
I did feel a distinct chill at
one point, but that was just
a draught from the window.

11:04.292 --> 11:07.253
Well, she's probably
keeping you in suspense,
making you suffer.

11:07.337 --> 11:09.047
Tell me about it,
I married her.

11:10.214 --> 11:11.507
So what happened?

11:13.217 --> 11:15.303
Well...

11:15.386 --> 11:18.056
She cared more about
her career than about us.

11:18.139 --> 11:23.144
-And more about her
clients than about me.
-Mmm.

11:23.227 --> 11:25.521
I suppose she spends
a lot of time with Archie,
does she?

11:25.605 --> 11:31.444
And has the condemned man
eaten a hearty breakfast?
Graham, I'm Golly.

11:31.527 --> 11:34.489
I'll be taking
you and Archie out
for a bit of fishing.

11:34.572 --> 11:35.948
You know anything about flies?

11:36.032 --> 11:39.327
Oh, yes.
All my trousers have them.

11:40.119 --> 11:42.413
Ah. Right.

11:45.667 --> 11:50.338
Ah, Brian, dear boy.
You're a sight for sore
eyes and parched palates.

11:50.421 --> 11:54.175
One crate of assorted
single malts, Mr MacDonald.

11:54.258 --> 11:56.511
-Splendid.
Now where do I sign?
-You don't.

11:56.594 --> 11:59.013
-Do you have
a purchase order for this?
-Purchase order?

11:59.097 --> 12:00.723
Stella, really.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.101
Mr MacDonald's word
has always been
good enough for us.

12:03.184 --> 12:05.228
Then I'm amazed your firm is s
till in business.

12:05.311 --> 12:07.355
Take it back, please,
we're not signing for it.

12:07.438 --> 12:09.816
Do you expect me to drink that
battery acid you bought?

12:09.899 --> 12:11.984
Thanks.
Sorry about the mix-up. Bye.

12:12.068 --> 12:15.822
Oh, this is outrageous!
Brian's been
delivering my malts for years.

12:15.905 --> 12:19.826
I know, my bank's paying
for it. And the only way we're
gonna get our money back

12:19.909 --> 12:23.287
is if we put your
liver on display
as a medical phenomenon!

12:23.371 --> 12:25.081
How dare you!

12:25.164 --> 12:27.583
Can't a gentleman have a glass
of half decent
whisky in the evening?

12:27.667 --> 12:29.877
Certainly, if a gentleman's
willing to work for it,

12:29.961 --> 12:32.255
which you seem totally
unwilling to do.

12:32.338 --> 12:36.843
-Or are you just incapable?
-I am going for a walk.
I may be some time.

12:36.926 --> 12:40.555
Then why don't you
take back the empties
while you're at it!

12:44.934 --> 12:48.062
So you are still into
blood sports up here, then?

12:50.148 --> 12:52.316
-DUNCAN: Stella.
-(SHOUTING) What?

12:52.942 --> 12:54.068
Nothing.

12:58.823 --> 13:02.785
-Another advert?
-No, a letter of resignation.

13:02.869 --> 13:06.039
Oh, Duncan,
there's no need for that.

13:06.122 --> 13:10.168
You're right.
I could always call
her from the Job Centre.

13:10.251 --> 13:13.671
Look, why don't you
try niche marketing?

13:13.755 --> 13:17.008
There's no point.
She's only six months old.

13:17.091 --> 13:19.844
-Who is?
-My niece.

13:19.927 --> 13:23.598
Oh, no. I mean, you find
where the customers are

13:23.681 --> 13:25.933
and then you
target them directly.

13:26.726 --> 13:27.894
Oh.

13:28.895 --> 13:29.979
Oh.

13:40.782 --> 13:44.327
GOLLY: Okay, try it.
Remember that a lot of
the action is in the wrist.

13:44.410 --> 13:48.373
That's it. Now remember,
Graham, just try to blend
in with the river.

13:48.456 --> 13:49.916
Very Zen.

13:51.334 --> 13:52.710
Oh, sorry.

13:53.878 --> 13:56.339
Try not to blend in that much.

13:56.422 --> 14:00.635
Has Stella tried this?
She looks like she
needs to lighten up a bit.

14:00.718 --> 14:05.014
-Well, the bank's
on her back, I think.
-Ah, same old story.

14:05.098 --> 14:09.602
So tied up with her work,
life just passes her by.

14:09.686 --> 14:13.356
-How long were
you two together?
-Two years.

14:13.439 --> 14:17.402
-Seems like longer,
it was so intense.
-Look, just try it over there.

14:19.737 --> 14:23.574
-There.
-We were young.

14:23.658 --> 14:28.621
(SCOFFING) We were both a bit
nuts. If I had my time again,
I'd do exactly the same.

14:29.539 --> 14:31.624
Love like that...

14:31.708 --> 14:34.335
It's the most amazing rush.

14:34.419 --> 14:36.504
It could never last,
more's the pity.

14:38.297 --> 14:41.592
-So would you two like
to get back together?
-Nah.

14:43.302 --> 14:45.138
We've burned our bridges.

14:45.221 --> 14:48.850
Och, well, we have plenty of
experience mending
bridges round here.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.601
That right, Archie?

14:50.685 --> 14:51.769
Yep.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.191
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather round.

14:57.275 --> 15:02.280
-Visit Glenbogle
House in the heart of...
-Never heard of it.

15:02.363 --> 15:07.493
A magnificent stately
home by Glenbogle Loch,
every stone soaked in history.

15:07.577 --> 15:10.204
Is this one of them?

15:10.288 --> 15:12.915
If you fancy a tour, there's a
coach leaving

15:12.999 --> 15:15.418
in 10 minutes from in front
of the post office.

15:15.501 --> 15:19.047
You don't want to
hang around here,
too much litter.

15:19.130 --> 15:22.258
-Hang on, I was here first.
-It's not a question
of being first, laddie.

15:22.342 --> 15:27.972
It's a question of being the
best. Leave the tour
business to professionals, eh?

15:28.056 --> 15:32.393
View the highlights
of the Highlands
from a fully heated coach,

15:32.477 --> 15:36.814
with panoramic views
and an expert guide.

15:36.898 --> 15:40.401
Oh, hang on. I can do you
a tour of the Highlands.

15:40.485 --> 15:43.654
In a four wheel drive,
with heating and a radio.

15:43.738 --> 15:47.867
If you don't mind helping him
change that wheel first.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.127
What's all this?

15:58.211 --> 16:03.341
Well, I thought that Graham
and Stella could have a wee,
you know, tete-a-tete.

16:03.424 --> 16:08.971
-And Stella's agreed to this?
-No. Not exactly.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.307
Oh, you mean you
haven't told her yet?

16:11.391 --> 16:14.686
-Did you two have plans?
-No, don't be daft.

16:14.769 --> 16:18.106
Actually, I think
it's a very good idea.
I'll talk to her.

16:20.775 --> 16:23.778
No, Archie,
I'll have to listen to him.

16:23.861 --> 16:27.323
And I can't, not even for
your precious Glenbogle.

16:27.407 --> 16:30.660
It's dinner, that's all.
And I really don't think
it's gonna be that bad.

16:30.743 --> 16:34.330
What do you mean?
What's he been saying?

16:34.414 --> 16:37.417
All right, forget about
Glenbogle, do it for yourself.

16:37.500 --> 16:41.879
If this works out,
we will be beating off
customers with a big stick.

16:44.007 --> 16:46.843
Lexie's doing trout.

16:48.511 --> 16:50.179
The way you like it.

16:50.263 --> 16:52.557
Mmm,
plenty of strychnine on his.

16:54.225 --> 16:55.560
(SIGHING)

16:56.686 --> 16:59.772
Excuse me,
I have to get changed.

17:09.656 --> 17:12.117
Oh, I knew it was
too good to last.

17:12.201 --> 17:15.371
Archie seems to think
you'd appreciate my company.

17:15.454 --> 17:18.040
That Archie, he's such a wag.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.542
Look, Graham, whatever
happened between us,

17:20.626 --> 17:22.086
don't take it out on
the people here.

17:22.170 --> 17:23.921
-They don't deserve it.
-Come on.

17:24.005 --> 17:26.049
There is such a thing
as journalistic ethics.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.384
Yeah, I knew that,
I just didn't
know you knew that.

17:28.468 --> 17:30.636
I've never
mixed up my business
with my personal life.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.139
Oh, no, you're
a consummate professional.

17:33.222 --> 17:35.641
All those diaries of
your conquests don't count.

17:35.725 --> 17:37.518
-Stella.
-How did they go again?

17:37.602 --> 17:39.729
STELLA: There was,
er, Anna from Minsky's.

17:39.812 --> 17:43.232
Three out of
ten for technique,
ten out of ten for enthusiasm.

17:43.316 --> 17:47.070
Then there was,
er, Julie from accounts
and Suzie from the takeaway.

17:47.152 --> 17:49.029
They were diaries.

17:49.113 --> 17:50.572
You weren't supposed
to read them.

17:50.656 --> 17:52.407
Those women certainly weren't.

17:52.492 --> 17:55.328
But, of course,
you had to copy them
and pass them around.

17:55.411 --> 17:59.123
Everyone's entitled to
read their own appraisal,
Graham.

17:59.207 --> 18:02.085
I've paid for my sins.

18:02.168 --> 18:06.839
-We both made stupid mistakes.
-Yeah, you were mine.

18:06.923 --> 18:10.635
Mine was making the one woman
I ever really
loved hate my guts.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.055
And now I've
gone and told her.

18:16.516 --> 18:20.478
-Father. There you are.
-Well, of course I am.

18:20.561 --> 18:25.024
I belong here.
I'm like that house,
a crumbling old ruin.

18:25.108 --> 18:28.903
Expensive to run
and serving no
purpose whatever.

18:28.986 --> 18:32.073
Stella was too harsh on you,
but she's got
her own problems.

18:32.156 --> 18:37.036
She was right, though, wasn't
she? I'm an aristocrat.
No marketable skills.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.914
I'm a relic. A figurehead
on a sinking ship.

18:39.997 --> 18:44.252
-Come inside and have a drink.
-Ha! That
mouthwash she calls whisky?

18:44.335 --> 18:47.463
-There are more dignified
ways of ending it all.
-That is enough!

18:47.547 --> 18:51.801
You are a MacDonald.
The elder of a fighting clan.

18:51.884 --> 18:55.805
We have never been driven out
by fire, sword or siege.

18:55.888 --> 18:59.225
And we will not be
defeated by spreadsheets.

18:59.308 --> 19:03.813
-I won't have this pathetic,
maudlin defeatism.
-Don't bark at me, boy.

19:03.896 --> 19:07.442
-You're not too big
to go across my knee.
-That's more like it.

19:07.525 --> 19:11.904
We'll find a job for you,
even if it's only
frightening away the tourists.

19:11.988 --> 19:15.116
Now come inside before
the midges suck you dry.

19:30.465 --> 19:32.383
I promised I'd
never admit this

19:32.467 --> 19:37.638
but the worst thing
is seeing you so
happy and successful.

19:39.390 --> 19:43.728
I could kick myself
knowing that I'll never
be a part of that now.

19:44.854 --> 19:46.397
Not like Archie.

19:48.274 --> 19:54.405
-Archie?
-Come on, I've seen
the way he looks at you.

19:54.489 --> 19:58.785
-You always had
a lively imagination.
-I'd never spoil it for you.

19:58.868 --> 20:01.579
I've already hurt you
enough for a lifetime.

20:01.662 --> 20:04.374
What happened
back then with you
and that businessman...

20:04.457 --> 20:06.501
-Oh.
-...it was my fault.

20:06.584 --> 20:10.296
I was selfish and I was cruel.

20:10.380 --> 20:15.426
I drove you to it.
Forgive yourself, okay?
Even if you can't forgive me.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.136
You've every
right to despise me.

20:17.220 --> 20:21.099
I don't know why
you didn't push
the divorce through ages ago.

20:21.182 --> 20:25.269
-Why didn't you?
-I never got round to it.

20:25.353 --> 20:29.065
Super-efficient Stella
skimping on the paperwork?
I don't think so.

20:30.817 --> 20:32.568
You don't wanna
say it's over...

20:34.654 --> 20:36.114
because it isn't.

20:42.662 --> 20:46.582
-Graham, I'm really tired.
-Remember that
poem at our wedding?

20:46.666 --> 20:48.960
"I have spread my
dreams under your feet"

20:49.043 --> 20:50.670
Don't.

20:50.753 --> 20:54.298
"Tread softly,
for you tread on my dreams"

21:27.749 --> 21:29.584
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

21:39.719 --> 21:43.514
Hi. I just came to
turn down your bed.

21:43.598 --> 21:48.186
-No woman's ever
turned down my bed.
-Except Stella.

21:48.269 --> 21:50.188
I don't know what
that girl wants.

21:50.271 --> 21:53.524
She won't have me back
but she won't say it's over.
It's torture.

21:53.608 --> 21:57.612
-Aye,
well, that's Stella for you.
-What time do you finish?

21:57.695 --> 22:00.156
Er, that's me finished now
. Why?

22:00.239 --> 22:02.492
I could really use
some company.

22:02.575 --> 22:06.287
Just to talk.
Maybe have a nightcap.

22:06.371 --> 22:11.209
-Okay.
I'll ask Archie to pop in.
-Archie?

22:11.292 --> 22:15.463
Yeah, well I'm up
at five, you know.
Gotta sweep those chimneys.

22:15.546 --> 22:18.466
Maybe I should do
some work on my article.

22:18.549 --> 22:20.843
Fine. Happy typing.

22:28.393 --> 22:32.897
STELLA: Money for
photocopying? So you've given
out all 200 flyers?

22:32.980 --> 22:35.191
Not exactly.
They sort of flew away.

22:35.274 --> 22:40.530
Duncan, so far your
marketing campaign
has cost us 160 quid,

22:40.613 --> 22:44.992
including a new tyre for the
Land Rover, and what have you
got to show for it?

22:45.076 --> 22:47.954
-Building brand awareness.
-By leafleting
the local sheep.

22:48.037 --> 22:49.956
-Forget it, you're fired.
-What?

22:50.039 --> 22:53.126
Your services are no longer
required, but don't feel
too bad about it,

22:53.209 --> 22:55.503
in five days' time
we'll all be out of a job.

22:55.586 --> 22:57.964
-No, you're not fired.
-Archie!

22:58.047 --> 23:02.260
-You're gonna go out
there and make it happen.
-No second chances, Archie.

23:02.343 --> 23:03.886
Go on, go.

23:07.015 --> 23:09.350
I have had just
about enough of this.

23:09.434 --> 23:11.602
First you bite my
father's head off,

23:11.686 --> 23:15.398
and then you try to fire
Duncan for doing the best
that he can with nothing.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.276
Face it, the problem is
Graham, and you are gonna
have to sort it out.

23:18.359 --> 23:19.736
-Archie.
-Not now, mother.

23:19.819 --> 23:22.113
It's Hector.
His bed hasn't been slept in.

23:23.865 --> 23:26.617
(SIGHING) Right, um...

23:26.701 --> 23:29.162
You take the grounds,
start by the loch.
I'll take the pick-up.

23:29.245 --> 23:30.913
-Boss.
-What about Graham?

23:30.997 --> 23:33.166
I'm supposed to be giving him
a watercolour
lesson this morning.

23:33.249 --> 23:34.917
Well, stick to that.

23:36.294 --> 23:38.921
We are gonna find my father.
Come on.

24:04.364 --> 24:08.159
On your bike, son.
These punters are taken.

24:08.242 --> 24:11.371
Look, we don't have
to waste our energy
competing with each other.

24:11.454 --> 24:15.833
-Why not make
Glenbogle a stop on your tour?
-Huh, that dump.

24:15.917 --> 24:17.960
But it's got everything
your customers want.

24:18.044 --> 24:22.507
It's got beautiful
grounds and a visitor centre
with souvenirs and crafts.

24:22.590 --> 24:24.425
I know, the usual tat.

24:24.509 --> 24:27.595
It's amazing the rubbish
these people will buy.

24:27.679 --> 24:32.392
-But it would be good
business for all of us.
-Look, why should I?

24:32.475 --> 24:35.353
-Well, like I said, it...
-Never mind that nonsense.

24:35.436 --> 24:37.230
Why should I bring my punters,

24:37.313 --> 24:40.817
desperate to blow their
hard- earned pennies,
to your place?

24:40.900 --> 24:43.861
-Much obliged, Donald.
-What?

24:43.945 --> 24:47.281
Do you think I brought
them here for the food?
It's disgusting.

24:48.950 --> 24:50.785
I can't afford backhanders.

24:50.868 --> 24:52.370
But, but maybe when
w e get up and running...

24:52.453 --> 24:54.372
Well, good luck
getting business.

24:54.455 --> 24:55.748
You'll need it.

24:59.669 --> 25:02.422
You know, this week
has been a revelation.

25:02.505 --> 25:05.174
Well, I hope you tell
that to your readers.

25:05.258 --> 25:08.052
-Sorry, I'm being forward.
-Not at all.

25:08.136 --> 25:12.724
I've already finished the
first draft. I think you could
safely call it a rave.

25:12.807 --> 25:14.559
(MOLLY CHUCKLING)

25:16.769 --> 25:20.773
-Tate Modern, here I come.
-All you need
now is the beret.

25:20.857 --> 25:22.608
Well, thank you.

25:25.069 --> 25:27.697
He hasn't been here
and he's not hiding
at Kilwillie's, so...

25:27.780 --> 25:31.701
Look, Archie, I've got bette
r things to do than hunt down
Bonnie Prince Hector.

25:31.784 --> 25:34.537
Well, you should
have thought of that
before you laid into him.

25:34.620 --> 25:38.332
Look, I know you're under
a lot of pressure, Stella,
but so is he.

25:38.416 --> 25:43.796
He's an old man, not some
dodgy client creaming off
the business account.

25:43.880 --> 25:48.051
Did you ever have a week
when everything that
could go wrong did?

25:48.134 --> 25:50.511
Have you ever
been to Glenbogle?

25:50.595 --> 25:54.515
My boss thinks
I've lost my touch,
and he's probably right.

25:56.184 --> 26:00.188
And now Graham appears
asking me to take him back.

26:00.271 --> 26:03.900
When I married him I
was making a commitment,

26:03.983 --> 26:07.695
he was making
contingency plans.

26:07.779 --> 26:12.116
He just carried on
drinking and carrying on.

26:12.200 --> 26:16.537
And after months of misery
I made the stupid mistake.

26:16.621 --> 26:20.541
-You don't have
to tell me this.
-I slept with a client. Once.

26:20.625 --> 26:24.420
And Graham found out,
the bank found out
and I had to quit.

26:24.504 --> 26:27.131
So I moved to
Lascelles and started again.

26:27.215 --> 26:31.010
I only lost
a few years promotion
and all my self-respect.

26:33.596 --> 26:35.473
And now I'm making the
same mistakes again.

26:35.556 --> 26:37.850
Oh, come on, you haven't
slept with a client.

26:37.934 --> 26:40.603
I might as well have.

26:40.687 --> 26:45.108
I can't make Glenbogle
pay its way because...

26:45.191 --> 26:48.027
I've got too
close to the business.

26:48.111 --> 26:52.615
I'm going to get fired
and I'm going to deserve it.

26:52.699 --> 26:56.661
You always seem so
certain of yourself,
so in control.

26:56.744 --> 26:59.414
-I never realised
that you were so...
-Screwed up?

26:59.497 --> 27:01.082
No, human.

27:02.917 --> 27:05.461
You can't give in,
Stella, not now.

27:05.545 --> 27:08.631
You're not alone, you've
got all of us behind you.

27:08.715 --> 27:12.719
-We won't let
them railroad you.
-What about Glenbogle?

27:12.802 --> 27:16.014
Well, Glenbogle's
nothing without its people.

27:16.097 --> 27:20.435
I'm afraid you're one of
us now. But I won't tell
them that if you don't.

27:22.812 --> 27:26.232
-Let's get some lunch.
-What about Hector?

27:26.315 --> 27:30.737
We'll dig a big pit,
drop in a bottle of malt,
have him back by sundown.

27:41.497 --> 27:47.378
We can eat at the bar. Why
don't you order something and
I'll find a phone and call in?

27:47.462 --> 27:52.050
Now, note the rich amber
colour, the drops that
stick to the side.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.635
Precious oils,
the soul of the dram.

27:54.719 --> 27:57.180
(SNIFFING) Mmm,
strong personality.

27:57.263 --> 27:59.807
Well-seasoned and mature. Mmm.

28:02.935 --> 28:05.480
Hello, Hector.

28:05.563 --> 28:08.858
(SIGHING) Is
there anywhere safe?

28:08.941 --> 28:11.986
-I'm sorry I was
a bit hard on you.
-No, you weren't.

28:12.070 --> 28:15.281
Perfectly natural to expect me
to earn my own keep.
I'm just good for nothing.

28:15.365 --> 28:19.118
Well, I don't know, in that
hat we could always hire
you out as a scarecrow.

28:21.537 --> 28:27.043
-Father, where have you been?
-Did you know this
place has 35 single malts?

28:27.126 --> 28:28.961
I'm gently working
my way through them.

28:29.045 --> 28:33.091
-Come on, home.
-Well, there's
a small matter of the bill.

28:34.801 --> 28:36.260
Mmm.

28:36.344 --> 28:40.473
Stella, you are
the soul of generosity
and forbearance.

28:40.556 --> 28:43.267
Lead the way, Archie.

28:43.351 --> 28:46.104
(MUMBLING) And get a move on.

28:46.187 --> 28:49.982
What was he doing with
the stuff, bathing in it?

28:50.066 --> 28:52.276
(SIGHING) What's the use?

28:53.945 --> 28:56.989
They just
follow him like sheep
and he fleeces them.

28:58.783 --> 29:00.410
The Art of War?

29:00.493 --> 29:03.037
A lot of useful
advice in there
for the aspiring businessman.

29:03.121 --> 29:05.081
"Employ deception.

29:05.164 --> 29:09.585
"Although you are competent,
appear incompetent."

29:09.669 --> 29:12.839
-I can manage that.
-Keep going.

29:12.922 --> 29:18.094
"A bushel of your
enemy's provisions
is worth twenty of our own."

29:18.177 --> 29:21.472
Sheep stealing, Duncan,
has a long and noble history.

29:21.556 --> 29:24.308
Where do you think
the aristocracy started?

29:30.732 --> 29:32.483
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

29:32.567 --> 29:33.735
Come in.

29:36.946 --> 29:38.322
Here we are.

29:38.406 --> 29:41.826
Dinner's in an hour
and I've run you a bath.

29:41.909 --> 29:44.203
Hmm, is that our,
er, school report?

29:45.747 --> 29:48.499
Oh, any chance of a back rub?

29:48.583 --> 29:51.002
Stella's still
out with Archie.

29:51.085 --> 29:54.380
-When the cat's away...
-Your bath's getting cold.

29:54.464 --> 29:56.632
What are you
doing here, Lexie?

29:56.716 --> 30:01.846
Waiting on
these inbred aristos
with their idiot retainers?

30:01.929 --> 30:05.183
You're far too
bright and beautiful
to live in this hole.

30:06.809 --> 30:09.562
(SIGHING) I'm on
the run from the police.

30:10.271 --> 30:12.106
Really?

30:12.190 --> 30:15.943
I took an axe to my boyfriend
when I found out
he was married.

30:17.236 --> 30:19.739
Mmm.
Dinner's in an hour, is it?

30:20.823 --> 30:22.283
Dress informal.

30:38.424 --> 30:42.470
For goodness sake, I just went
for a walk. I didn't think I'd
need a note from the prefect.

30:42.553 --> 30:44.847
-You had us worried sick.
-Why, exactly?

30:44.931 --> 30:48.601
Apart from providing
endless hours of amusement,
what am I good for?

30:48.685 --> 30:49.977
MOLLY: Oh, Hector.

30:50.061 --> 30:51.729
-Lexie?
-Mmm?

30:51.813 --> 30:53.481
What are you doing with
Graham's laptop?

30:53.564 --> 30:57.026
Ah, not much.
It's all password protected.

30:57.110 --> 30:59.028
That's his private property,
the man is a guest.

30:59.112 --> 31:01.531
The man is a creep.
I don't trust him.

31:01.614 --> 31:03.700
He said he'd give
us a rave review.

31:03.783 --> 31:08.162
He said I lived in a hole
with a bunch of
inbred aristocrats.

31:08.246 --> 31:10.873
Now,
anyone want to make a guess
at the password?

31:12.917 --> 31:15.003
Try stallion.

31:15.086 --> 31:17.046
-Excuse me?
-Don't ask.

31:18.464 --> 31:21.926
Okay. Stall-ion.

31:23.261 --> 31:24.429
Bingo!

31:24.512 --> 31:27.098
"Fawlty McTowers."

31:27.181 --> 31:28.433
(CLEARING THROAT)

31:28.516 --> 31:30.727
That doesn't sound
very good, does it?

31:32.770 --> 31:37.025
"Glenbogle offers
Scottish hospitality,
with the emphasis on hospital.

31:37.108 --> 31:40.653
"It has the allure of
an underfunded
geriatric ward."

31:40.737 --> 31:42.196
I'll kill him.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.366
"The gillie's endless yarns
and shortbread philosophy

31:45.450 --> 31:49.287

31:49.370 --> 31:53.499
"The so-called Highland

"The best you can say for
it is that it's unique."

Oh, cute!

I should have known,
the two-faced... He's doing
this to get back at me.

32:09.974 --> 32:11.517
If he hurts you,
he hurts all of us.

32:11.601 --> 32:14.562
I suggest we tar
and feather him
and send him packing.

32:14.645 --> 32:19.192
No, no, Hector. We slice him
open and feed his
tripes to the fishes.

32:19.275 --> 32:21.819
Oh, please, that's not
exactly good publicity.

32:21.903 --> 32:24.072
It's a big estate.
Who's gonna know?

32:24.155 --> 32:28.868
No, we can't stop him writing
the article. We can't afford
a lawsuit or an injunction.

32:28.951 --> 32:30.787
So we're stuffed.

32:32.413 --> 32:37.877
-Golly, you are
taking him out tomorrow.
-With pleasure, boss.

32:37.960 --> 32:41.506
No, I don't mean... I
mean take him out for a walk.

32:41.589 --> 32:45.176
Keep him busy while I, um,
while I think of something.

32:47.345 --> 32:49.555
-Are we eating in here?
-Oh, Graham.

32:49.639 --> 32:52.183
No, no, no, no, no,
this is a, er, staff meeting.

32:52.266 --> 32:55.269
Just making sure
everyone's doing their bit
to keep you happy.

32:55.353 --> 32:58.272
How about a drink, eh?
Give us the courage
to get through supper.

32:58.356 --> 33:00.108
But I love Lexie's cooking.

33:00.191 --> 33:01.859
(CHUCKLING)

33:06.864 --> 33:08.199
(CLATTERING)

33:35.476 --> 33:38.730
Ah, Graham, it's yourself.

33:38.813 --> 33:42.400
I hope you've broken in those
boots. We've quite a bit
of walking to do.

33:42.483 --> 33:43.860
I'm looking forward
to more stories.

33:43.943 --> 33:47.447
Och, no, son. No, no,
no tall tales today.

33:47.530 --> 33:49.991
I think it's time
you had a real taste
of the Highlands.

33:50.074 --> 33:53.870
-And don't forget
your Highland cuisine.
-Lexie.

33:53.953 --> 33:57.248
I love the way you
handle my lunchbox.

33:57.331 --> 33:59.667
(CHUCKLING) Behave.

34:13.889 --> 34:15.891
Ah, Graham!

34:17.351 --> 34:19.395
A drop of
the local speciality.

34:19.478 --> 34:22.523
One swig and you'll be
able to bring down a stag
with your bare hands.

34:22.607 --> 34:25.068
Hector, you are
better than a St Bernard.

34:29.197 --> 34:32.074
-Golly, can I have a minute?
-Sure.

34:36.746 --> 34:39.998
I just wanted to
say have a good day.

34:40.083 --> 34:43.795
-I don't have to
go on this hike.
-Oh, no, no. No, you must.

34:43.878 --> 34:46.214
I've got the books to do.

34:46.297 --> 34:49.801
Let's, um, let's talk
when you get back, okay?

34:52.053 --> 34:56.264
-Look after him for me, Golly.
-Oh, I will.

34:56.349 --> 34:58.685
I know how
dangerous the woods can be.

35:18.705 --> 35:22.959
Rest stop. If you're
not back in 10 minutes,
we leave without you.

35:55.783 --> 35:59.579
Ladies and gentlemen,
the tour starts in one minute.
So finish up, please.

35:59.662 --> 36:02.457
What happened to
the other driver?

36:02.540 --> 36:05.500
Er, dodgy Scotch egg.
Very nasty.

36:05.585 --> 36:08.338
You don't want to know.
Come on, folks.

36:09.505 --> 36:13.051
STELLA: He knew I was here.
Look.

36:13.134 --> 36:18.513
He wrote an anonymous letter
to my boss about why I left
Mersey Commercial.

36:18.597 --> 36:21.559
Mmm, it was no
coincidence at all, then,
his coming here.

36:23.185 --> 36:26.856
He's been looking for revenge
ever since I left him.

36:26.939 --> 36:29.942
And when you wrote in,
it gave him
the perfect opportunity.

36:30.026 --> 36:33.446
So,
first he tips off the bank,
then he slates Glenbogle.

36:33.529 --> 36:36.324
We go bust and you get fired.

36:36.407 --> 36:40.161
Mmm. Well,
your old man really knows how
to bear a grudge.

36:40.244 --> 36:43.164
I wondered why you never
trusted anyone. Looks like you
had good reason.

36:43.247 --> 36:45.958
Well, I never met anyone
I could trust until I...

36:48.336 --> 36:51.297
Er... What are those?

36:51.381 --> 36:56.094
Er, notes for Graham's
article. The revised version.

36:56.177 --> 36:58.805
-Are you going to write it?
-And email it in.

36:58.888 --> 37:02.308
-So when he comes to
submit the real one...
-It'll be too late.

37:02.392 --> 37:04.352
(CHUCKLING) You hope.

37:04.435 --> 37:07.980
-Well, if you've got
a better plan, I'm all ears.
-You dictate, I'll type.

37:20.660 --> 37:21.786
Down!

37:24.330 --> 37:26.332
Right down, you'll spook them.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.713
Just a wee bit of mud.

37:31.796 --> 37:34.007
(COCKING GUN)

37:34.090 --> 37:36.592
Oh, dear. They heard us.

37:38.177 --> 37:39.470
Come on.

37:42.765 --> 37:44.767
Are you sure this is mud?

37:47.353 --> 37:50.565
Oh, aye, aye.
Aye, you're right,
Graham, well spotted.

37:50.648 --> 37:53.401
Probably some fox
marking out his territory.

37:53.484 --> 37:57.280
Ach, well,
it'll cover up the smell
of your aftershave, eh?

37:57.363 --> 37:58.865
Come on.

38:02.744 --> 38:04.954
"Among Glenbogle's
eccentric charms..."

38:05.038 --> 38:07.123
What's wrong with
"outstanding attractions"?

38:07.206 --> 38:09.709
-We can't gush.
-Why not?
We need the business.

38:09.792 --> 38:13.880
Because we'll be rumbled.
We have to keep some
semblance of objectivity.

38:13.963 --> 38:19.093
"Among
Glenbogle's eccentric charms
are its colourful staff."

38:19.177 --> 38:22.972
-"Is its colourful staff",
staff is singular.
-No, it's not, it's plural.

38:23.056 --> 38:25.183
It's a collective noun,
it's singular.

38:25.266 --> 38:27.727
-Look,
who's writing this article?
-Graham.

38:27.810 --> 38:31.105
And his
grammar's awful so, yeah,
have it your way.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.657
-That's an idea.
-What?

38:41.741 --> 38:46.162
You could hire
me as a life model
for your painting courses.

38:46.245 --> 38:50.458
Somehow I don't think there'll
be much of a demand for you to
get your kit off, Hector.

38:50.541 --> 38:52.752
There's not much of
a demand anyway.

38:52.835 --> 38:55.046
Well, maybe they'd pay me
to keep it on. Eh?

38:57.757 --> 38:59.509
Well, it's not bad.

39:01.969 --> 39:07.517
-And I highly recommend it...
-Warmly recommend it.

39:07.600 --> 39:12.480
Warmly recommend it.

39:12.563 --> 39:13.940
Five hundred words.

39:14.023 --> 39:15.316
Probably needs
a bit of polishing.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.110
It definitely needs
a bit of polishing.

39:17.193 --> 39:20.697
-How long's Graham
gonna be out there?
-I'll plug us in.

39:20.780 --> 39:23.157
-Well, where shall I send it?
-Find the email
address of his paper.

39:23.241 --> 39:27.078
Yep, got it.
Come on, come on, come on.

39:27.161 --> 39:29.205
-Hello?
-He can't be back already.

39:29.288 --> 39:31.666
-Stall him.
-No,
don't, that switches it off.

39:34.293 --> 39:38.548
-Oh, Duncan. What do you want?
-Am I still fired?

39:41.968 --> 39:44.053
Sorry about the short notice.

39:44.137 --> 39:48.099
You must strike when the foe
is not prepared and attack
when he does not expect.

39:48.182 --> 39:49.684
Duncan, you did it.

39:49.767 --> 39:51.561
Yeah, well, I got them here.
What do I do with them now?

39:51.644 --> 39:53.062
Send them back from
whence they came.

39:53.146 --> 39:55.189
Give them a guided tour,
of course.

39:55.273 --> 39:59.485
Archie, you'd better warn
Lexie, she'll be
feeding the multitudes.

39:59.569 --> 40:03.072
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Glenbogle,

40:03.156 --> 40:07.744
the historic seat
of the MacDonald clan
for more than 500 years.

40:07.827 --> 40:10.413
The house,
as you see it today,

40:10.496 --> 40:13.541
is a legacy of our
Victorian forebears,

40:13.624 --> 40:18.379
who wanted to
capture the spirit of
medieval architecture.

40:18.463 --> 40:21.632
While these
towering battlements
have never seen war...

40:31.684 --> 40:33.519
Are we nearly there yet?

40:35.688 --> 40:40.860
-Oh, not far.
We're almost halfway.
-Halfway?

40:40.943 --> 40:44.364
We'll get some
food inside you.
That'll keep your energy up.

40:48.868 --> 40:51.579
Ah, it's a fine view, Graham.

40:51.662 --> 40:55.792
You know, there are some
people who think this
countryside is dreary.

40:56.876 --> 40:59.587
Hard to believe, isn't it?

40:59.671 --> 41:01.547
Yeah, fabulous.

41:08.012 --> 41:10.431
What is this stuff?

41:10.515 --> 41:13.017
I...
I think I'm gonna be sick.

41:14.894 --> 41:16.646
(RETCHING)

41:26.239 --> 41:28.700
(COUGHING)

41:28.783 --> 41:31.619
Any more of that soup?
It was wonderful.

41:35.081 --> 41:36.708
(CHATTERING)

41:39.669 --> 41:43.339
I always say,
if they don't have a price,
you can't afford them.

41:43.423 --> 41:45.550
-I'm sorry?
-The watercolours.

41:45.633 --> 41:50.221
-They are for sale,
aren't they?
-Oh, yes, of course.

41:50.304 --> 41:54.350
-That one is Â£30.
-Thirty?

41:54.434 --> 41:57.770
-Do you take cheques?
-We take anything we can get.

42:04.193 --> 42:06.279
MAN: It's a taste
of the Highlands.

42:06.362 --> 42:10.908
It'll just sit on the shelf
with all the retsina
and the plum brandy.

42:10.992 --> 42:13.578
Can I, er, help at all?

42:13.661 --> 42:18.374
(SIGHING) My
husband insisted on buying
this whisky in the village.

42:18.458 --> 42:21.502
-I thought it
looked authentic.
-May I?

42:23.504 --> 42:27.550
Oh, yes.
12-year-old Strathmona.

42:27.633 --> 42:30.178
A fine malt. Don't
waste it on your friends.

42:30.261 --> 42:34.474
-He won't drink it.
-I'm still trying
to acquire the taste.

42:34.557 --> 42:39.896
A palate that can't appreciate
a single malt is in sore need
of education. Come with me.

42:39.979 --> 42:41.939
-We'd love to, but...
-No buts.

42:42.899 --> 42:44.233
This way.

42:47.028 --> 42:51.366
-You're taking us
round in circles.
-Ach, I'm sorry, son.

42:51.449 --> 42:54.535
See, I know so little about
the countryside, it all...

42:54.619 --> 42:56.954
It all just looks the
same to me.

42:57.038 --> 43:00.041
Oh, I see.
Oh, that's very cute.

43:00.124 --> 43:02.460
I suppose Stella put
you up to this, did she?

43:02.543 --> 43:04.504
I enjoyed your article,
Graham.

43:04.587 --> 43:08.174
I hope they print it on
nice soft absorbent paper.

43:08.257 --> 43:09.717
I'm going back.

43:12.637 --> 43:15.890
-Well, I wouldn't go that way.
-You think I'm
gonna listen to you?

43:20.812 --> 43:25.149
At least you'll be able to say
now that you've really
tasted the Highlands.

43:26.859 --> 43:29.362
All aboard,
please, ladies and gents.

43:32.657 --> 43:36.786
-Thank you so much.
Do tell your friends.
-Thank you.

43:40.164 --> 43:41.958
He was right.

43:42.041 --> 43:47.338
You know, you could taste the
peat and the notes of
smoke and the...

43:47.422 --> 43:52.218
And the smell of heather.
It was Scotland in a glass.

43:52.301 --> 43:56.347
We didn't drink
all that, did we?
Where's the rest of it?

43:57.807 --> 44:00.018
-Still in his decanter.
-Oh.

44:12.822 --> 44:15.283
Bye. Do come again.

44:15.366 --> 44:17.952
Yes, they were quite
well behaved for a rabble.

44:18.036 --> 44:23.207
I think I'll give up tuition.
Painting for oneself is
so much more rewarding.

44:36.888 --> 44:39.057
See, this is
the best view of the loch.

44:41.059 --> 44:43.394
What on earth is that?

44:45.313 --> 44:46.939
(ROARING)

44:48.441 --> 44:50.485
Hikers.

44:50.568 --> 44:55.573
They go into the woods,
get lost for weeks on end.
Go mad. Completely.

44:56.532 --> 44:57.617
Tragic.

44:57.700 --> 44:59.911
I'm glad we stuck
with the guided tour.

45:09.420 --> 45:11.047
What have you done with him?

45:11.130 --> 45:14.717
Oh, is he not back yet?
Ah, well,
listen, he won't starve.

45:14.801 --> 45:17.095
He's got Lexie's sandwiches.

45:20.348 --> 45:22.350
You are finished.

45:22.433 --> 45:25.436
Once they run my piece,
you'll be lucky
if rats stay here.

45:25.520 --> 45:30.274
And you will be back in your
polyester twinset flogging
mortgages over the phone.

45:30.358 --> 45:34.112
It's not over until I
say it's over, sweetheart.

45:34.195 --> 45:36.614
You think you can
rip my life to bits
and then just walk away?

45:36.698 --> 45:38.825
Oh, Graham, grow up!

45:38.908 --> 45:40.827
I hope we lived up
to your review.

45:40.910 --> 45:42.495
You think that was
a bad review?

45:42.578 --> 45:45.373
-You should see
the latest draft.
-Actually, we have.

45:45.456 --> 45:48.167
We've even sent
it off for you,
with a few amendments.

45:48.251 --> 45:49.752
(PHONE RINGING)

45:49.836 --> 45:51.254
Hello, Glenbogle House.

45:52.463 --> 45:54.340
Yes. Who's calling?

45:55.383 --> 45:58.052
Oh, you got it. Good.

45:58.136 --> 46:01.639
Er, it's your editor.
Calling to say
thanks for the article.

46:01.723 --> 46:04.600
You, er, might want to
leave him well alone.

46:04.684 --> 46:07.937
He won't be too impressed
if he hears you were
writing a libellous report

46:08.021 --> 46:10.106
just to spite your ex-wife.

46:11.774 --> 46:15.028
No,
he can't speak at the moment.
Can I take a message?

46:15.111 --> 46:18.197
His best piece
to date, really?

46:18.281 --> 46:21.576
Going out this Sunday.
Ah, he'll be delighted.

46:21.659 --> 46:23.745
Yes,
you'll be seeing him soon.

46:23.828 --> 46:26.122
In fact,
he'll be leaving shortly.

46:31.210 --> 46:34.172
I caught up on that
paperwork you asked about.

46:37.842 --> 46:42.847
Well, what do you know?
I am a soon-to-be-published
journalist.

46:42.930 --> 46:44.724
It's nothing to
brag about, Archie.

46:46.059 --> 46:47.935
(DOOR BANGING SHUT)

46:48.019 --> 46:52.732
Well, I have to admit it,
Duncan, you came up with
the goods. Well done.

46:52.815 --> 46:55.943
-Thanks very much.
-So how much did we
clear on the tour?

47:00.239 --> 47:01.949
Er...

47:02.033 --> 47:04.786
How much did you charge them?
I presume you
allowed for the meal?

47:04.869 --> 47:07.330
Yes.

47:07.413 --> 47:12.585
Well,
actually it was sort of, er,
what you would call...

47:14.462 --> 47:16.673
-A pilot scheme?
-A loss leader.

47:16.756 --> 47:19.425
-A what?
-Ah, you're here.

47:19.509 --> 47:22.095
-A Mr Sweeney to see you.
-Sit!

47:27.183 --> 47:29.644
-Can I help you?
-I might have known.

47:29.727 --> 47:32.939
This fella took a party
of my punters round here

47:33.022 --> 47:36.859
after somebody
locked me in the toilet.

47:36.943 --> 47:39.404
I see.
How very obliging of him.

47:39.487 --> 47:44.325
The thing is, a lot of them
want to come back
with their friends.

47:44.409 --> 47:49.831
I was wondering
if we might come to
some sort of arrangement.

47:49.914 --> 47:52.166
Well, give Mr Sweeney a seat.

47:54.252 --> 47:59.424
The thing is, any tour
would have to include
a malt tasting course.

48:01.300 --> 48:02.552
I'm sorry?

48:02.635 --> 48:05.346
The old codger who
teaches people whisky tasting.

48:05.430 --> 48:08.683
I've got six punters
down for a session already.

48:08.766 --> 48:11.853
-Get Hector back in here,
please, Duncan.
-Yes, ma'am.

48:17.233 --> 48:20.695
I still can't
believe it, you know.
Fifty quid a throw.

48:20.778 --> 48:22.905
And they bring the whisky.

48:22.989 --> 48:25.575
All I have to do is
drink it and talk about it.

48:25.658 --> 48:28.077
If I give you 50 quid,
will you shut up about it?

48:28.161 --> 48:30.997
I think it's wonderful,
darling. I'm thrilled for you.

48:31.080 --> 48:35.918
As I've always said, there's
dignity in honest toil.

48:36.002 --> 48:41.507
I thought a gentleman would
never sully himself with
anything so vulgar as trade.

48:41.591 --> 48:46.179
Tasting whisky is
not trade, Alexandra.
It's an art form.

48:46.262 --> 48:50.558
I, like my lovely wife,
am an artist.

48:50.641 --> 48:54.645
-Aye, we all know
what sort of artist.
-Preci...

48:54.729 --> 48:58.024
(LEXIE AND MOLLY CHUCKLING)

48:58.107 --> 49:01.861
They've cut it,
my line about
the Highlands of the heart.

49:01.944 --> 49:05.365
-I told you it was cheesy.
-It was not. It was poetic.

49:05.448 --> 49:07.658
It's still a great review.

49:07.742 --> 49:11.537
Yeah, it is, isn't it?
And extremely well typed.

49:11.621 --> 49:15.667
Maybe now you'll stop fretting
so much about our prospects.
Relax a little.

49:15.750 --> 49:19.045
I will,
when the books stop bleeding
all over my desk.

49:19.128 --> 49:20.296
Oh, there you go again.

49:20.380 --> 49:21.798
How many times do I have to
tell you,

49:21.881 --> 49:24.467
Glenbogle is not just
a business, it's our home.

49:24.550 --> 49:26.636
There you go again.

49:26.719 --> 49:29.681
And thanks to you
it'll go on being our home
for years to come.

49:29.764 --> 49:33.017
-Thanks to you, too.
-We make quite a team,
don't we?

49:33.101 --> 49:36.020
Yep. Me as the brains.

49:36.104 --> 49:39.148
-I thought I was the brains.
-You're the brawn.

49:40.441 --> 49:42.735
Thanks for
protecting me, Archie.

49:45.863 --> 49:47.699
Sorry.

49:47.782 --> 49:51.160
I thought you
didn't wanna make
the same old mistakes.

49:54.205 --> 49:57.583
-Ah, there he is.
He's in here.
-Well, what did you think?

49:57.667 --> 50:00.670
"Promising cooking".
What does it promise exactly?

50:00.753 --> 50:02.505
Venerable, Archie? Venerable!

50:02.588 --> 50:04.632
What's that supposed to mean?
It makes me sound senile.

50:04.716 --> 50:07.218
"Molly's painting is full of
grace and serenity..."

50:07.301 --> 50:09.053
If you really think
I wasted my three years

50:09.137 --> 50:11.139
at The Slade,
why didn't you say so?

50:11.222 --> 50:13.516
I'm not even mentioned.
Is that because
I'm an embarrassment?

50:13.599 --> 50:17.145
-How long did it take
you to write this rubbish?
-Am I an embarrassment to you?

50:17.228 --> 50:19.981
(ALL TALKING TOGETHER)
