00:13.500 --> 00:15.333
[birds calling]

00:16.625 --> 00:18.625
[poignant music]

00:33.416 --> 00:35.208
[echoing bird calls]

00:41.166 --> 00:43.166
[bird calls continuing]

00:47.125 --> 00:48.000
[squawk]

00:52.125 --> 00:54.125
[Geralt wheezing]

00:56.041 --> 00:56.958
You're awake.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.500
And pleasant as ever.

01:03.666 --> 01:04.833
No, witcher.

01:04.916 --> 01:07.250
No news of Nilfgaard or the girl.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.625
And no, I didn't ask.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.625
Ask the wrong question,
they'll string you up.

01:11.708 --> 01:15.916
And then how would we have
these… lovely daily chats?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.500
[Geralt groans]

01:22.000 --> 01:22.875
Grouse.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.750
Caught especially for you.

01:26.541 --> 01:27.791
I don't want it.

01:29.625 --> 01:30.833
Of course you don't.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.916
Ungrateful twat.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.000
[Eithné] Still won't eat?

01:37.083 --> 01:39.708
You're sure this one deserves your help?

01:39.791 --> 01:41.083
Let us decide that.

01:41.916 --> 01:43.625
Same as we decided for you,

01:43.708 --> 01:46.375
and the Scoia'tael
you've asked us to take in.

01:48.666 --> 01:50.666
I will never command you, Milva.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.291
Nor return you
to the horrors of your past.

01:54.791 --> 01:56.750
But you do owe a debt.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.750
Keep him alive.

01:59.833 --> 02:01.291
Why is he so special?

02:02.166 --> 02:06.083
You are not the only one
who protects lost souls.

02:08.416 --> 02:11.500
Many that do are broken themselves.

02:13.625 --> 02:16.875
[Jaskier] I just heard a Nilfgaardian
royal carriage has been seen traveling.

02:16.958 --> 02:20.000
[Geralt grunts]
How long until Emhyr has her?

02:20.583 --> 02:22.333
Your guess is as good as mine.

02:22.416 --> 02:24.458
[Geralt wheezing]

02:24.541 --> 02:27.375
-What are we gonna do, Geralt?
-Help me up.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.250
-[grunts]
-All right, take it easy.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.041
-Stop!
-[Milva] Let him be, bard.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.500
-Easy--
-He broke his back. And look at his leg.

02:34.041 --> 02:37.541
[sighs] Like I've been saying,
you can't leave unless you get better.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.208
And you won't get better
unless you let us help you.

02:40.291 --> 02:43.375
You need more healing waters
and plenty of rest.

02:44.916 --> 02:45.750
Grouse?

02:47.958 --> 02:49.541
Give me the damn grouse.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.291
Oh, now you want it.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.250
[wheezes]

02:54.333 --> 02:56.958
There's a very weird energy
between you two.

02:57.666 --> 02:59.208
[Geralt groans]

03:00.625 --> 03:03.166
[Jaskier] I don't wanna tell them
how to do their jobs,

03:03.250 --> 03:05.708
but are we sure that these healers are…

03:05.791 --> 03:07.791
[healer murmuring in Elder]

03:08.375 --> 03:09.500
…qualified?

03:11.416 --> 03:13.041
[healer speaking in Elder]

03:16.041 --> 03:17.791
-[sizzling]
-[yells]

03:17.875 --> 03:19.208
Hey. Are you all right?

03:19.291 --> 03:20.875
[dryads speaking in Elder]

03:21.916 --> 03:22.958
[Geralt moans]

03:23.833 --> 03:25.958
[poignant music]

03:35.958 --> 03:37.041
[grunts]

03:42.041 --> 03:43.666
[Geralt sighing]

03:46.166 --> 03:48.125
The waters weren't successful.

03:48.208 --> 03:50.500
They're meant for natural beings,
not mutants.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.500
[grunts] Pack up. We leave in the morning.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.791
Good, yeah. Uh, might I suggest we wait

03:55.875 --> 03:59.333
until your leg pus
stops visibly oozing first?

03:59.833 --> 04:03.291
You're in no shape to walk across
the forest, much less the Continent!

04:03.375 --> 04:05.708
-Can you even hold the damn sword?
-[Geralt groans]

04:06.458 --> 04:07.541
Are you gonna stop him?

04:07.625 --> 04:11.333
I've been telling him for months he needs
to think about himself, not just Ciri.

04:11.416 --> 04:14.208
-Oh, so you're not completely useless?
-But I was wrong.

04:15.333 --> 04:18.041
Protecting her,
protecting his family, it's who he is.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.291
I'd have to kill him to stop him.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.291
And even in this sorry-arse state,

04:22.375 --> 04:25.791
I'm pretty sure he could
snap me like a toothpick, so no.

04:26.791 --> 04:28.750
-I'm not gonna stop him.
-[sighs]

04:28.833 --> 04:30.208
If he needs my help,

04:30.916 --> 04:31.958
he has it.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.833
So you're both fucking lunatics!

04:37.708 --> 04:40.250
You really think
you're ready to go find your girl?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.791
-[yells]
-'Cause you'd be dead now.

04:43.875 --> 04:45.875
[breathing unsteadily]

04:53.916 --> 04:55.625
[cracking]

05:00.000 --> 05:01.666
[rumbling]

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
[ethereal music]

05:20.833 --> 05:22.041
[man] Let it off!

05:23.333 --> 05:24.541
[man yells] Go ahead!

05:27.375 --> 05:28.875
[Yennefer] Crach an Craite!

05:28.958 --> 05:30.541
-[woman 1 whoops]
-[laughter]

05:30.625 --> 05:32.250
[woman 2] Oi, oi, treacle!

05:32.791 --> 05:34.791
[woman 1] So it's definitely you, then!

05:35.666 --> 05:38.125
[Yennefer] There's no sign of Ciri
in the Eastern Skelligens.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.833
-Any news from the rest of your fleet?
-[woman 3] Oh, good!

05:42.833 --> 05:44.750
-[man] I'm not--
-She's not dead, I can feel it.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.375
[Crach an Craite] Aye,
but the alternative's not much better.

05:47.458 --> 05:51.333
There's a rumor bubbling up in the South
that Ciri's heading to Nilfgaard.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.416
[woman 1] Come on!

05:53.875 --> 05:55.541
Well, she'd never go willingly.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.041
Vilgefortz.

06:00.291 --> 06:01.958
An Aretuzan mage gone rogue.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.958
He's taking her to Emhyr.

06:04.041 --> 06:07.166
Listen, the tribunal wants
to patter on about peace talks.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.166
If Ciri's siding with Nilfgaard,

06:10.375 --> 06:11.500
we're obliged to join.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.625
-You'd fight for Nilfgaard?
-Fuck, no!

06:15.416 --> 06:17.250
[sighs] At least, not willingly.

06:18.083 --> 06:22.250
But Ciri's also Princess of Brugge
and a shit ton more vassals.

06:23.375 --> 06:26.083
Those butterball lords,
they won't put up a fight.

06:26.166 --> 06:27.875
If Ciri joins Nilfgaard,

06:28.458 --> 06:29.958
the whole Continent shifts.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.458
I'll get to her before then.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.625
Well, then, maybe
this horseshit surrender talk stops.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.833
You know where this Vilgefortz
has got her stowed?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.625
[sighing sounds]

06:51.291 --> 06:53.291
[echoing bird calls]

06:58.166 --> 06:59.458
[Yennefer, echoing] Ciri?

07:00.291 --> 07:01.708
Ciri, are you here?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
[Triss] Oh, gods!

07:04.625 --> 07:05.916
[Yennefer gasps]

07:06.625 --> 07:07.958
[Rita] What happened here?

07:11.125 --> 07:12.416
These are our girls.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.750
[Sabrina gasps]

07:15.833 --> 07:17.208
It's worse than Geralt described.

07:17.291 --> 07:20.083
[Philippa] If you're looking
for Vilgefortz, he's gone.

07:20.916 --> 07:24.125
-[Yennefer] We're looking for Ciri.
-Then I'll save you the time.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.458
I've searched the castle. It's empty.

07:26.541 --> 07:28.416
What kind of magic can do this?

07:28.500 --> 07:31.083
-None we've ever practiced.
-None like any we've ever seen.

07:31.166 --> 07:34.125
[Sabrina] How did we not see it?
Who Vilgefortz really was.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.125
Some of us did.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.750
It'll take all of us
to reverse this spell.

07:40.708 --> 07:41.625
Together.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.333
They deserve that.

07:53.875 --> 07:57.541
[all speaking in Elder]

07:59.708 --> 08:01.625
[sighing and rumbling sounds]

08:01.708 --> 08:03.041
[repeating spell]

08:04.833 --> 08:06.833
[hissing sounds]

08:08.583 --> 08:10.500
[repeating spell]

08:13.625 --> 08:15.916
[groaning sounds]

08:16.000 --> 08:17.875
[deep, resonating vibration]

08:20.375 --> 08:22.000
[repeating spell]

08:24.208 --> 08:26.208
[loud rumbling]

08:26.291 --> 08:28.291
[fading sigh]

08:30.708 --> 08:31.625
[Triss] Nissa.

08:32.416 --> 08:34.666
Eva. Elisabet.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.291
[Sabrina] May they have peace.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.250
[Keira] I want to get
as far away from here as possible.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.541
[Triss] This isn't right.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.166
[Philippa] Stay, if you like.
I have to get back to Tretogor.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.375
[Triss] Stop!

08:49.458 --> 08:51.416
We can't just leave them there!

08:51.500 --> 08:53.500
They deserve a proper burial.

08:54.416 --> 08:55.416
To honor them.

08:57.583 --> 08:58.458
To remember them.

08:58.541 --> 09:00.833
Now you're going to remember them.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.708
Berate us all you want.

09:03.416 --> 09:05.916
But these girls were killed here,
in Redania.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.708
Vilgefortz did it under your nose.

09:07.791 --> 09:09.416
Yes, and he wouldn't have
brought them here

09:09.500 --> 09:12.166
if she had looked after them properly
at Aretuza.

09:13.750 --> 09:18.416
You always propped up the Brotherhood,
its importance in protecting Chaos.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.541
But with Vilgefortz,
you simply propped up the man.

09:21.625 --> 09:25.541
Save your sanctimony.
I know I failed. But so did you.

09:26.541 --> 09:27.916
Go, run back to Tretogor.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.250
Do not forget you were willing to bring
the Brotherhood down with your purge.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.250
And why? Not for Chaos. No.

09:33.333 --> 09:37.166
You destroyed whomever so Vizimir would
see you lurking in Dijkstra's shadow.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.208
You th--

09:41.958 --> 09:43.291
We are partners.

09:44.291 --> 09:47.500
-I can trust Dijkstra.
-Yeah, like I trusted Vilgefortz.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.708
But that is the problem with trust.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.541
You have it until you don't.

09:53.625 --> 09:54.916
[Yennefer] Please stop.

09:55.708 --> 09:59.000
Every minute that passes,
Vilgefortz draws closer to Nilfgaard.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.916
I don't know
what he or Emhyr want with Ciri,

10:05.333 --> 10:07.291
but look at what he did to those girls.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.291
We return them to Aretuza.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.166
We give them peace.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.458
Then… we fight.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.291
To make sure this never happens again.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.416
[neighing]

10:41.958 --> 10:43.583
[man] Close the gates!

10:44.291 --> 10:46.125
[portentous music]

10:47.666 --> 10:49.708
[soldiers chanting]

11:03.750 --> 11:04.666
[soldier] Move it!

11:04.750 --> 11:06.458
Are you sure about this?

11:06.541 --> 11:08.541
-[soldier] Forward!
-[horses neigh]

11:12.333 --> 11:14.000
Nilfgaard made their play.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.541
Now let's make ours.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.583
[soldiers marching]

11:23.125 --> 11:26.833
[Emhyr] Press harder. We must take
Dillingen to secure the western front.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.458
Fringilla.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.791
It appears you have returned
from the grave just in time. Leave us.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.083
[courtier] Good day, my lord.

11:36.166 --> 11:38.708
My fighters tell me that

11:39.458 --> 11:42.458
your arrival in Aretuza

11:42.541 --> 11:46.416
helped secure
what some may call a victory.

11:47.625 --> 11:48.625
[Fringilla] It did.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.250
We succeeded at Thanedd
because of the elves, their sacrifices.

11:53.333 --> 11:56.375
It's thanks to them
the Brotherhood is in shambles.

11:57.125 --> 12:00.083
The North, however, is still a worthy foe.

12:01.125 --> 12:04.708
[Francesca] We need to secure Xin'trea's
ports and gain control of the Yaruga.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.000
[Fringilla] Temeria's most critical
supply chain. You lose that…

12:09.583 --> 12:10.666
you lose the war.

12:11.708 --> 12:14.541
You need someone. Someone
who knows Xin'trea from the inside.

12:14.625 --> 12:17.750
Someone who has
Nilfgaard's interests at heart.

12:17.833 --> 12:21.958
[Emhyr] So you're proposing that I forgive
your past sins and return you to Cintra?

12:23.541 --> 12:25.583
Us, my lord.

12:26.166 --> 12:27.291
Side by side.

12:28.375 --> 12:31.458
Cirilla is on her way home.
That's what we all wanted.

12:32.083 --> 12:35.083
And she will reign
by your side as intended.

12:35.166 --> 12:36.083
And she…

12:38.000 --> 12:40.583
She needs you here. In Nilfgaard.

12:41.375 --> 12:45.208
So allow me to serve you
as Imperial Governor of Xin'trea,

12:45.291 --> 12:49.208
and Francesca… can give her people
the home they deserve.

12:49.291 --> 12:52.166
I must say, Fringilla,
death, it becomes you.

12:53.666 --> 12:54.916
[sighs]

12:55.458 --> 12:58.958
And I have faith
that being Imperial Governor will too.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.958
Especially with the…
Queen of the Elves by your side.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.208
I guarantee you won't regret it, my lord.

13:10.708 --> 13:14.916
And thank you for recognizing
that we delivered what was promised.

13:16.541 --> 13:18.041
The Scoia'tael deserve peace.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.208
-The Scoia'tael?
-[Francesca] Mmm.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.125
No.

13:24.041 --> 13:29.250
You may lead the elves in Cintra, the old,
the sick, the ones who-- who cannot fight,

13:29.333 --> 13:31.250
but the Scoia'tael, they stay with us.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.500
They know the land so well.
They are an effective force in the North.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.541
You mean a dispensable one.

13:38.541 --> 13:39.666
They won't do it.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.875
Not as long as they serve me.

13:41.958 --> 13:43.083
Then disavow them.

13:46.958 --> 13:49.375
Either they die

13:49.458 --> 13:50.541
fighting for us,

13:51.208 --> 13:53.416
so the rest of your… people may live,

13:53.500 --> 13:56.583
or all of your people die

13:56.666 --> 13:58.208
fighting to survive.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.541
The elves have sacrificed so much.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.791
Don't let it be for nothing.

14:04.958 --> 14:05.916
[chuckles softly]

14:15.291 --> 14:17.291
[dramatic music]

14:28.500 --> 14:30.000
[door opens]

14:30.083 --> 14:30.958
[Dijkstra] Leave.

14:32.666 --> 14:33.541
Go.

14:34.416 --> 14:38.291
I thought you might be dead, Dijkstra.
I swore I sent for you yesterday.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.041
I came as fast as I could.

14:40.958 --> 14:42.916
Corpses have come faster,
that was the joke.

14:43.541 --> 14:46.458
Moving on.
What do you hear from the front?

14:46.541 --> 14:51.291
Nilfgaard has taken towns
in Aedirn, Lyria, and Cidaris.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.875
And Radovid, any word?

14:54.375 --> 14:56.458
We've got everyone we can spare
searching for him.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.875
This is not where you promised we'd be.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.458
-There were eventualities.
-Yeah.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.666
You were to purge the Brotherhood
and come back heroes.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.375
Instead, Aretuza is a pile of rocks,

15:16.458 --> 15:18.666
the Brotherhood has no brothers left,

15:18.750 --> 15:21.708
and my brother's dead
in a fucking ditch somewhere.

15:21.791 --> 15:23.916
I see you opening your mouth.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.125
Don't. Don't try and handle me.

15:29.416 --> 15:30.541
Not you, Sigismund.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.166
Hmm.

15:35.208 --> 15:37.625
Luck plays a role in everything we do.

15:38.750 --> 15:43.291
And while I mitigate that role as much
as I can, we were unlucky at Thanedd.

15:44.541 --> 15:45.916
A few minutes too late.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.458
A message
for naval reinforcements not received.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.083
A fucking witcher.

15:51.541 --> 15:54.791
But our intelligence was right
and our plan was correct.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.250
None of which stops
my people from doubting me.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.916
[Dijkstra sighs]

16:00.750 --> 16:04.125
You and I have been through
difficult times, but nothing like this.

16:04.625 --> 16:05.958
Examples must be made.

16:06.458 --> 16:07.916
[armor clanks]

16:09.208 --> 16:10.375
I'm truly sorry.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.791
Because I know how much you like Philippa.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.583
But someone's got to pay.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
[Vizimir sighs]

16:27.000 --> 16:28.708
Do not disappoint me again.

16:29.958 --> 16:31.958
[tense music]

16:36.250 --> 16:37.416
[Dijkstra grumbles]

16:45.708 --> 16:47.708
[dramatic music]

16:57.875 --> 16:59.458
[grunting]

17:01.125 --> 17:02.666
[exhales]

17:07.666 --> 17:08.791
[groaning]

17:24.833 --> 17:26.125
Aaah!

17:26.833 --> 17:27.750
[yelps]

17:27.833 --> 17:29.083
You'd be dead now.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.708
Go back to bed, witcher.

17:32.541 --> 17:33.625
[grunts]

17:41.375 --> 17:42.500
[Jaskier] He is going.

17:43.375 --> 17:45.041
With or without me.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.625
Is he at full strength yet?
Of course he's not.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.708
Look at that leg,
it's like a sock full of marbles,

17:50.791 --> 17:52.625
which is why he needs somebody

17:53.958 --> 17:55.791
to look after him until he's better.

17:57.583 --> 17:58.916
You're not his friend.

17:59.416 --> 18:02.875
You're tagging along to get
one more song out of him when he dies.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.666
How dare you?

18:08.791 --> 18:11.583
I would milk his death
for, like, three songs.

18:11.666 --> 18:13.833
And maybe an epic poem, so…

18:17.083 --> 18:18.083
Uh…

18:18.166 --> 18:19.208
[scoffs]

18:19.291 --> 18:20.458
[grunts]

18:21.375 --> 18:22.750
You're useless.

18:22.833 --> 18:24.833
And he's truly useless.

18:24.916 --> 18:27.333
Neither of you is any good
to that girl dead.

18:28.083 --> 18:31.500
Every day that I spend here
is another that Ciri's in danger.

18:32.541 --> 18:34.458
Just because you're hiding from the world

18:35.666 --> 18:37.166
doesn't mean that I have to.

18:39.166 --> 18:40.208
[Geralt sighs]

18:41.583 --> 18:42.500
[grunts]

18:44.875 --> 18:45.708
Fine.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.250
Go.

18:49.041 --> 18:50.666
-[crunching]
-[yells]

18:50.750 --> 18:51.708
[Jaskier] Wait!

18:53.958 --> 18:54.833
[Geralt groans]

18:56.208 --> 18:57.083
[sighs]

18:57.166 --> 18:58.916
[birdsong]

19:03.166 --> 19:04.541
I don't wanna hear it.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.583
[sighs]

19:18.541 --> 19:19.791
You've got it wrong.

19:20.666 --> 19:22.125
I'm not scared to leave.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.875
I'm scared of what I'd do to them…

19:28.625 --> 19:30.416
the people who hurt me,

19:30.500 --> 19:31.666
if-- if I did.

19:32.708 --> 19:34.416
I know that fear.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.875
Their waters are supposed
to make you forget.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.666
Guess they didn't work on me either.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.500
Does it remind you of someone you lost?

19:53.625 --> 19:54.958
It looks important.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.041
[Geralt sighs]

20:03.750 --> 20:06.000
It reminds me of someone I killed.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.041
[blade slashes]

20:07.125 --> 20:08.208
[gasps]

20:14.166 --> 20:16.375
I've always tried to stay above the fray.

20:16.458 --> 20:18.250
-Monster!
-Butcher!

20:18.333 --> 20:19.666
To shut everything out.

20:23.708 --> 20:26.083
And life always finds
a way to force my hand.

20:26.166 --> 20:27.208
[crowd yelling]

20:27.291 --> 20:29.333
Witcher! You take the wrong ones!

20:30.125 --> 20:31.708
[Milva] Or forcing you to make a choice.

20:32.333 --> 20:33.250
I know.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.875
Whatever they did to you…

20:40.791 --> 20:41.958
I hope they pay.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.166
Like the world works that way.

21:04.916 --> 21:05.958
[Yennefer] Tissaia.

21:13.541 --> 21:14.750
Tissaia, look at me.

21:14.833 --> 21:17.750
I just got word.
Redania and Kaedwen lost another battle.

21:17.833 --> 21:19.791
Since when have you cared
about movement of troops?

21:19.875 --> 21:22.875
Since I became responsible
for the death of each and every soldier.

21:23.958 --> 21:25.458
This war was inevitable.

21:26.708 --> 21:27.541
Was it?

21:27.625 --> 21:31.541
You could've handed Ciri's head over
to the kings on a platter to win support.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.000
But you didn't.

21:33.916 --> 21:34.791
No.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.041
No, I could never have done that.

21:38.958 --> 21:40.666
Your pain is my pain.

21:42.541 --> 21:44.166
My pain is your pain.

21:54.666 --> 21:56.375
They make us sacrifice so much.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.791
The cost of learning magic.

22:02.041 --> 22:05.666
When I came to Aretuza, if a sorceress
fell pregnant, she was kicked out.

22:06.666 --> 22:08.000
"Divided loyalties,"

22:09.833 --> 22:10.875
said the men.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.500
So I made them take us seriously.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.500
The enchantment was never
about clearer access to Chaos.

22:18.583 --> 22:20.666
It was about getting a seat at the table.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.875
And the Brotherhood, they called me bold.

22:26.375 --> 22:27.750
I was just desperate.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.500
The first of many mistakes.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.291
-Stop it.
-Look around, it's all gone.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.208
Forget this, go to Brokilon.

22:35.291 --> 22:38.416
-Salvage what you can with the witcher.
-Geralt's getting help.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.583
My focus is here, on Ciri.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.375
If I go to him without her, I've failed.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.083
There are worse failures.

22:45.666 --> 22:47.750
Spare me the self-loathing bullshit.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.250
This feeling sorry for yourself,

22:51.333 --> 22:54.416
and letting Vilgefortz
make you question who you are.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.541
This isn't you!

22:58.500 --> 22:59.541
I know you.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.250
At your core.

23:03.625 --> 23:06.500
Everything I've done,
everything that's been done to me,

23:06.583 --> 23:08.708
I've survived because of your faith.

23:09.708 --> 23:12.375
You are the strongest force
I've ever known.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.291
[sobs]

23:14.625 --> 23:16.083
Remember your strength.

23:17.041 --> 23:20.791
You are Tissaia de Vries,
you are our mother, and we need you.

23:21.583 --> 23:22.500
I need you.

23:23.458 --> 23:25.375
[emotional music]

23:30.541 --> 23:32.041
[knocking at door]

23:32.125 --> 23:33.166
[door opens]

23:34.250 --> 23:35.833
The service for the novices.

23:36.375 --> 23:37.375
It's time.

23:40.625 --> 23:43.250
Go. I'll collect myself and come along.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.291
Thank you.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.125
[inhales]

24:16.708 --> 24:19.458
[Tissaia] One of the first things
we learn about Chaos…

24:25.541 --> 24:27.958
is that it always has consequences.

24:32.458 --> 24:34.375
There is a cost to this magic.

24:35.916 --> 24:37.833
And eventually, we all must pay.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.250
It is not a gift.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.125
It is a trade.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.541
And often,
that trade leads us to dark places.

24:51.583 --> 24:53.708
But there are always bright spots.

24:55.791 --> 24:58.875
Teaching you has been
the biggest bright spot of my life.

25:01.041 --> 25:04.250
And I would love to see you
through the next leg of your journey.

25:05.083 --> 25:08.208
I know you will do great things,
my daughter.

25:11.791 --> 25:13.750
But I'm afraid I cannot.

25:17.208 --> 25:19.666
There is a cost I must pay.

25:20.833 --> 25:22.083
[speaking in Elder]

25:26.791 --> 25:28.000
Sometimes a flower…

25:30.916 --> 25:32.250
is just a flower.

25:38.083 --> 25:40.291
And the best thing it can do for us

25:41.291 --> 25:42.166
is die.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.458
[Yennefer gasps]

25:50.541 --> 25:52.458
[emotional music swells]

26:03.916 --> 26:05.208
[sobs]

26:07.041 --> 26:08.166
[wails]

26:43.166 --> 26:45.166
[ethereal music]

26:53.750 --> 26:55.083
[gasps]

26:55.166 --> 26:56.208
[Yennefer] Geralt.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.541
[Geralt, muffled] Yen? You came.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.291
-[gasps]
-It's me.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.583
[sighs shakily]

27:09.708 --> 27:10.583
I'm sorry.

27:11.625 --> 27:13.000
I'm so sorry.

27:13.083 --> 27:14.250
I don't have her.

27:15.833 --> 27:16.666
No.

27:21.250 --> 27:22.583
It's my fault.

27:24.958 --> 27:26.875
I let Vilgefortz beat me.

27:32.166 --> 27:33.791
I couldn't protect her.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.458
[Yennefer sobbing]

27:40.833 --> 27:42.875
He's destroyed everything I love.

27:47.083 --> 27:47.916
Tissaia.

27:50.166 --> 27:51.416
[sighs] She's gone.

27:54.666 --> 27:55.708
I know it's not fair, but…

27:58.083 --> 27:59.625
I'm so angry with her.

28:03.583 --> 28:04.833
Who do we have now?

28:07.166 --> 28:08.541
We have you, Yen.

28:09.458 --> 28:10.583
[sobs]

28:10.666 --> 28:12.291
I will find Ciri.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.375
Those mages can't do this without you.

28:15.458 --> 28:16.833
[Yennefer sobs]

28:19.750 --> 28:20.791
It's not fair.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.541
I need you to heal me, Yen.

28:31.041 --> 28:35.041
-The dryads did what they could, but--
-There are some wounds magic can't heal.

28:37.333 --> 28:38.166
I know.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.500
I will make Vilgefortz pay.

28:43.041 --> 28:44.583
And I don't care if he's an emperor,

28:45.791 --> 28:47.291
I'll make Emhyr pay too.

28:51.250 --> 28:53.583
Tell me this isn't
the last time I'll see you.

28:55.416 --> 28:57.250
Say it. [sobs]

28:59.916 --> 29:01.541
I need you, Geralt.

29:07.541 --> 29:09.000
I need you too, Yen.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.458
[speaking in Elder]

-[wind gusting]

-[Geralt groaning]

29:37.375 --> 29:39.041
[spluttering]

29:42.833 --> 29:44.000
Someone's got to pay.

29:46.750 --> 29:50.125
Gah! Yes, yes. A price must be paid.

29:50.208 --> 29:51.666
[breathing heavily]

29:58.708 --> 30:00.833
[Vizimir] Gods, it's true. You're here!

30:01.666 --> 30:02.791
You're alive!

30:04.166 --> 30:05.458
[laughing]

30:08.208 --> 30:09.458
Oh, that's fine work.

30:09.958 --> 30:12.125
No, that's fine work indeed. Mmm.

30:14.791 --> 30:17.833
I was worried sick.
They should never have left you.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.958
Don't worry, there will be consequences.

30:20.708 --> 30:22.958
-Philippa--
-Found me and helped get me home.

30:23.041 --> 30:24.416
[Philippa] Your Highness.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.041
I could not rest until I knew he was safe.

30:28.125 --> 30:29.000
[sighs]

30:29.083 --> 30:32.375
I know Thanedd seems
like a blow to our cause,

30:33.166 --> 30:35.625
but, believe me,
the coup wasn't a total failure.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.333
We outed the Nilfgaardian traitor

30:38.416 --> 30:41.833
and we created a power vacuum
in the Brotherhood only we can fill.

30:41.916 --> 30:43.041
[Vizimir] A power vacuum?

30:43.708 --> 30:46.000

A pleasure, Your Grace.

46:03.166 --> 46:05.166
[cheering]

46:11.708 --> 46:14.208
[all chanting] Long live Princess Cirilla!

46:14.708 --> 46:17.791
Long live Princess Cirilla!

46:19.833 --> 46:22.416
Oi, blondie.

46:25.750 --> 46:27.333
[singsong] Blondie…

46:27.416 --> 46:29.208
-[man 2] So what's next week?
-[man 3] Oh--

46:29.291 --> 46:31.833
[man 1] Nice to see you finally awake.
[chuckles]

46:32.375 --> 46:34.041
You wanna get out of here?

46:34.583 --> 46:36.583
-[man 4] You eating that?
-[man 2] Ah, yeah.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.666
-[man 5] Another round!
-[laughter]

46:39.208 --> 46:40.375
[muffled sounds]

46:41.125 --> 46:42.541
[laughter continues]

46:43.125 --> 46:44.875
[Falka] Spoke in a wheel.

46:44.958 --> 46:46.750
-[echoing] Spoke in a wheel…
-[man 4] Oh!

46:46.833 --> 46:49.416
-[man 1] Oi, blondie.
-[man 6] We need more beer here, come on!

46:49.500 --> 46:51.291
-[man 4] Scopin' out?
-[man 5] Just got here.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.625
[man 1] How about it?

46:53.250 --> 46:54.125
Who are you?

46:54.208 --> 46:56.041
I'm the king of fuckin' Ebbing.

46:56.125 --> 46:57.583
-[laughter]
-[man 6] Don't take long!

46:57.666 --> 46:59.458
Now do exactly what I say.

46:59.541 --> 47:00.791
[man 7] Kayleigh. Heard of him?

47:01.791 --> 47:02.875
One of the Rats.

47:02.958 --> 47:05.833
The baron has put out a hefty price
for capture of his lot.

47:05.916 --> 47:06.791
[playful music]

47:06.875 --> 47:10.166
-Only reason I haven't killed him myself.
-Kayleigh, eh?

47:11.000 --> 47:14.541
The baron'll probably give you a pat
on the arse and a barrel of mead.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.041
[all chuckling]

47:16.958 --> 47:19.583
Our prize. Special little bird.

47:20.583 --> 47:23.166
That's the wench
Nilfgaard's been searching for.

47:23.250 --> 47:25.708
[man 7] You're as useless
as a eunuch in a whorehouse.

47:25.791 --> 47:27.041
They found that girl.

47:27.125 --> 47:30.250
[man 4] No, if they found her then why
is the prefect still offering a reward?

47:30.333 --> 47:33.333
[man 7] She's not worth more than
what's between her legs, the wee thing.

47:33.416 --> 47:35.333
-Still wouldn't mind a turn.
-[laughter]

47:37.750 --> 47:39.875
-Any of that food for us?
-Piss off!

47:41.291 --> 47:42.458
[man 2 chuckles] Good one.

47:46.083 --> 47:47.125
We're hungry.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.958
[laughing]

48:00.875 --> 48:01.833
You see?

48:03.166 --> 48:04.833
This bitch is highborn.

48:04.916 --> 48:06.458
-[yelps]
-[laughter]

48:06.541 --> 48:09.416
-You're the dumb one.
-She told you she was hungry, dickhead.

48:09.791 --> 48:11.291
-Ooh!
-Skomlik!

48:11.375 --> 48:14.375
Do what you wish with your girl,
but the Rat is mine!

48:15.083 --> 48:18.500
Touch him again,
I'll plunge this blade through your eye.

48:18.583 --> 48:19.583
Sit back down.

48:19.666 --> 48:22.083
-You lot, stay.
-Full of fuckin' threats, aren't you, boy?

48:22.166 --> 48:23.458
-Yeah, that's right.
-You get it?

48:23.541 --> 48:26.208
You fuckin' try, boy. You fuckin' try.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.958
-So you're not completely useless.
-I'll fight you!

48:29.041 --> 48:30.458
-You fucker!
-Good to know.

48:30.541 --> 48:32.666
-Wait till he pulls out the…
-Now slide it to me.

48:32.750 --> 48:35.708
-We'll start again--
-He's bigger than you, small boy.

48:35.791 --> 48:38.083
-Your mother had no complaint.
-I mean it, boy. Stand up.

48:38.166 --> 48:40.666
Stand up. Show me. Show me, boys.

48:40.750 --> 48:42.083
-Come on!
-[whistling]

48:42.166 --> 48:44.000
[woman 1] Having a party
without the rest of us?

48:44.083 --> 48:46.083
-[Skomlik] Who the fuck is she?
-[growls]

48:46.166 --> 48:47.291
Son of a bitch.

48:49.666 --> 48:50.583
[Skomlik] The Rats!

48:51.375 --> 48:52.875
The fucking Rats!

48:52.958 --> 48:54.458
Me and the brat'll be taking our leave.

48:56.208 --> 48:57.416
[Kayleigh] Mistle, behind you!

48:59.250 --> 49:00.833
[Skomlik] Where d'you think you're going?

49:05.375 --> 49:07.875
-No, you don't!
-[woman 2] Kayleigh!

49:08.416 --> 49:09.333
[groaning]

49:09.416 --> 49:12.083
I knew you were alive! You little shit.

49:24.916 --> 49:26.958
Back off! They're mine!

49:30.291 --> 49:31.625
[yells]

49:34.250 --> 49:35.416
Oi, come here!

49:47.000 --> 49:48.125
Nice one, Reef!

49:54.000 --> 49:54.833
Get away!

49:59.791 --> 50:01.333
[gurgles]

50:01.416 --> 50:02.500
[sighs]

50:04.666 --> 50:06.416
[chuckling]

50:08.416 --> 50:09.791
[Skomlik panting]

50:12.750 --> 50:14.333
-Hey, trouble.
-[Skomlik grunts]

50:15.291 --> 50:16.458
I'll take that!

50:24.958 --> 50:26.250
[chuckles]

50:26.958 --> 50:28.375
How about a fair fight?

50:41.250 --> 50:42.583
[chuckles]

50:45.083 --> 50:46.125
[grunts]

50:53.041 --> 50:54.125
Ah.

51:07.041 --> 51:08.958
Let's see how you do against a human.

51:16.791 --> 51:19.041
I don't think
you're man enough to take her.

51:20.541 --> 51:22.541
[slow, dramatic music]

51:27.750 --> 51:28.625
[roars]

51:31.666 --> 51:34.458
You'll pay for that, you highborn bitch!

51:39.041 --> 51:40.208
[grunts]

51:41.041 --> 51:42.250
[Kayleigh] Fuck me.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.208
She's playing with him.

52:00.791 --> 52:02.000
[gasps]

52:09.000 --> 52:10.625
[dramatic music swells]

52:24.125 --> 52:25.833
Move along, one at a time.

52:25.916 --> 52:28.333
-We'll never get there in time.
-Move along.

52:29.458 --> 52:30.541
Get in line!

52:31.916 --> 52:34.583
You'll need further identification.
Empty your pockets.

52:34.666 --> 52:36.750
[Jaskier] We'll never get to Ciri
if we can't get past.

52:36.833 --> 52:38.458
Or I can take your missus
round the corner,

52:38.541 --> 52:40.583
and she can convince me
to let you go through.

52:41.708 --> 52:43.583
There's got to be another way round.

52:43.666 --> 52:45.375
-Not for days.
-[man] Take this.

52:46.833 --> 52:48.166
Good man. On you go.

52:51.583 --> 52:52.708
Ta.

52:52.791 --> 52:53.916
[Jaskier] Good morning!

52:54.000 --> 52:56.416
-Hi. How… how are you?
-Papers.

52:56.500 --> 52:58.500
-[Geralt] We lost them.
-But-- but we…

52:58.583 --> 53:00.666
we would be happy to compensate you

53:00.750 --> 53:03.375
for, uh… for your troubles with…

53:03.458 --> 53:04.375
um…

53:05.333 --> 53:06.875
Give me a second. [chuckles]

53:06.958 --> 53:07.875
Uh…

53:08.583 --> 53:10.125
Not gonna help me out here, or anything?

53:10.208 --> 53:11.625
[guard 1] Wanna get through? Pay.

53:12.583 --> 53:15.333
Uh, that's… two! Two orens.

53:15.416 --> 53:16.625
[chortles]

53:16.708 --> 53:17.708
[guard 1 laughs]

53:17.791 --> 53:19.291
Uh… [laughing falsely]

53:19.875 --> 53:22.041
You're gonna have to do
better than that, freak.

53:23.666 --> 53:24.750
That looks nice.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Hold on.

53:29.458 --> 53:30.791
For your troubles…

53:31.541 --> 53:33.541
[guard 2] Baggage, please…

53:33.625 --> 53:35.708
-Friend.
-Geralt, no, come on, not that.

53:38.875 --> 53:39.708
Very nice.

53:40.958 --> 53:41.875
On you go.

53:42.916 --> 53:45.291
-Thank you, thank you so much.
-My pleasure.

53:47.291 --> 53:48.916
[man 2] We have this for you…

53:49.000 --> 53:50.166
[Yennefer] Dear friend,

53:50.833 --> 53:52.458
you once told me of a dream

53:53.333 --> 53:55.541
where you were wandering
through boundless fields

53:55.625 --> 53:57.791
towards an obelisk
carved with names of the dead.

53:57.875 --> 54:00.458
-[guard 1] It's all a toll.
-[woman] No! No!

54:00.541 --> 54:04.166
A woman with cold blue eyes
was following you.

54:04.250 --> 54:07.541
[guard 1] Any more out of you,
and she will leave here an orphan.

54:08.583 --> 54:11.541
You knew her because she had dogged
your every footstep.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.416
Just keep walking.

54:15.250 --> 54:17.458
Geralt, we need to get to Ciri. Geralt--

54:17.541 --> 54:19.333
"Why?" you asked her.

54:20.541 --> 54:22.416
"Was it because
you were meant to end up alone?"

54:22.500 --> 54:25.166
Why don't you let
the girl and her family go?

54:25.250 --> 54:26.083
Piss off.

54:26.958 --> 54:30.166
Or maybe I'll take her home
and see what use she can be put to.

54:30.666 --> 54:33.916
"Was it because she wanted you,
a witcher who needed no one,

54:35.333 --> 54:36.541
to finally be afraid?"

54:38.333 --> 54:39.666
You told her the truth.

54:40.833 --> 54:42.375
You'd always been afraid.

54:43.541 --> 54:44.375
Until now.

54:45.583 --> 54:47.875
Because she'd taken everything from you,

54:47.958 --> 54:50.083
which means she'd also taken the fear.

54:52.500 --> 54:56.750
You and I, we now know
what it means to need. To love.

54:58.166 --> 54:59.375
To lose it all.

55:00.625 --> 55:01.958
Neutrality be damned.

55:03.750 --> 55:05.375
We are no longer afraid.

55:17.625 --> 55:19.041
[Jaskier] Geralt, your sword!

55:20.250 --> 55:21.583
[yelps] A little help!

55:23.625 --> 55:24.458
Here.

55:28.416 --> 55:30.041
Everyone, under the wagon!

55:40.625 --> 55:42.083
-[grunts]
-[guard 2] Get him!

55:42.958 --> 55:44.750
-I'm gonna kill him--
-[all yelling]

55:48.875 --> 55:50.208
[sighs]

55:53.500 --> 55:54.500
[snorts]

55:55.750 --> 55:57.541
I know, I know.

55:58.583 --> 55:59.875
I'd be dead now.

56:01.583 --> 56:03.041
I've been lost before.

56:04.291 --> 56:05.875
Eithné says I still am.

56:07.333 --> 56:08.875
Would have been nice to…

56:08.958 --> 56:12.500
have someone looking for me
the way you're looking after your girl.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.125
Everyone's safe.

56:17.625 --> 56:18.541
We good?

56:19.666 --> 56:20.583
Not yet.

56:20.666 --> 56:21.625
Missed one.

56:22.791 --> 56:23.875
No, I didn't.

56:29.166 --> 56:30.416
[guard 1 grunting]

56:31.416 --> 56:32.375
[Geralt] Get up.

56:34.291 --> 56:37.000
If you manage
to get to Nilfgaard before I do…

56:41.291 --> 56:43.875
you tell that fuck Emhyr

56:44.750 --> 56:46.416
that no matter his armies,

56:47.125 --> 56:48.791
no matter his walls,

56:49.791 --> 56:52.250
I will free Ciri.

56:54.666 --> 56:55.708
Understand?

56:56.750 --> 56:57.875
[groans]

57:02.166 --> 57:03.416

57:12.541 --> 57:13.916
[sighs]

57:26.875 --> 57:29.125
[Yennefer] I know in my heart, Geralt,

57:29.208 --> 57:30.541
you will find Ciri.

57:33.333 --> 57:36.833
And I will make sure
there's a safe world for her to return to.

57:41.333 --> 57:44.708
And if we must face
the cold blue eyes of death,

57:46.416 --> 57:47.416
we will.

57:48.583 --> 57:50.625
But we will be the last to fall.

57:52.208 --> 57:53.541
Of that, I am sure.

57:54.333 --> 57:56.166
[music swells]

58:00.541 --> 58:01.708
All my love…

58:03.666 --> 58:04.625
Yennefer.

58:11.291 --> 58:14.166
-Last time we save your arse.
-That's a lie and we both know it.

58:14.250 --> 58:16.416
[Mistle] Shut up
and grab everything of value.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.083
[man] Anyone gonna talk about her?

58:26.166 --> 58:29.250
-[Reef] Is she mute or something?
-[Mistle] Give her a minute.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
They tell you it's gonna feel bad.

58:34.500 --> 58:35.666
Taking a life.

58:42.750 --> 58:43.791
But it doesn't.

58:44.375 --> 58:45.541
[man] We gotta go.

58:45.625 --> 58:48.166
-[woman] Is she alone?
-[Reef] She can use a sword.
