00:04.908 --> 00:07.276
Moira: John! Are you awake?

00:07.311 --> 00:09.846
- John!
- What? What's happening?

00:09.880 --> 00:12.664
Your wayfaring thespian has returned!

00:13.025 --> 00:15.394
I-I don't wanna jinx anything,

00:15.419 --> 00:17.720
but the shoot was a triumph.

00:17.755 --> 00:20.456
The local Bosnians are calling
it a stunning re-invigoration

00:20.491 --> 00:22.558
of the "Crows Have Eyes" franchise.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.594
That, of course, is a loose translation.

00:24.628 --> 00:26.929
Oh, well that sounds
great, sweetheart.

00:26.964 --> 00:29.632
John, no need to
get out of bed, dear.

00:29.666 --> 00:32.502
I'm sure you considered
planning a little more fanfare

00:32.527 --> 00:34.194
for my return, but...

00:34.238 --> 00:36.639
oh, it's best to ease back in.

00:36.673 --> 00:38.207
It's 3:30 in the morning,

00:38.234 --> 00:41.236
you said you were
coming in today at noon.

00:41.278 --> 00:44.247
Yes! Noon Bosnian
Mountain Time, that is!

00:44.281 --> 00:46.482
Which was several hours ago, John.

00:46.517 --> 00:48.985
Oh, and what a journey it has been!

00:49.019 --> 00:50.887
Production had me routed through Nairobi

00:50.921 --> 00:53.189
for some reason, and then
our plane was grounded

00:53.223 --> 00:55.758
after flying through a swarm of locusts.

00:55.793 --> 00:57.660
I didn't want to miss
my third connection,

00:57.694 --> 01:00.696
so I took a Bosnian
upper just to keep awake.

01:00.731 --> 01:02.242
Those things are the size of a nickel,

01:02.266 --> 01:03.866
so I only took one,

01:03.901 --> 01:05.101
at least, I think I did.

01:05.135 --> 01:06.913
I may have taken a second
one just to be safe,

01:06.937 --> 01:10.106
because I don't know if I
took that first one, or not.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.875
Either way, I've been up
since eight am three days ago,

01:12.910 --> 01:14.277
with time changes factored in,

01:14.311 --> 01:16.379
and I couldn't be happier to see you!

01:16.413 --> 01:17.680
Oh!

01:17.714 --> 01:20.917
Well Moira, it sounds
like a nightmare of a trip.

01:20.951 --> 01:22.919
Why don't we leave the
unpacking 'til tomorrow,

01:22.953 --> 01:25.221
and just get some rest?

01:25.255 --> 01:26.486
Good idea.

01:27.591 --> 01:28.658
Kids!

01:28.692 --> 01:30.660
- No Moira, it's 3:30.
- David!

01:30.694 --> 01:32.261
Alexis!

01:33.363 --> 01:35.131
- Oh! Who is it?
- Oh my God, what?!

01:35.165 --> 01:38.501
I don't know what you kids
are still doing up so late.

01:38.535 --> 01:40.169
I didn't want to disturb you,

01:40.204 --> 01:43.039
I just wanted you to know that
Mummy got home safe and sound!

01:43.073 --> 01:44.273
- Okay, good night.
- Great.

01:44.308 --> 01:46.175
Okay, if you insist, one quick story.

01:46.210 --> 01:48.744
So, day three of shooting, Hamza and I

01:48.779 --> 01:51.347
find ourselves stuck in a hail storm...

01:51.381 --> 01:52.792
Oh my God, not tonight,
thank you, though.

01:52.816 --> 01:55.651
I'm sorry kids, your mother's
had a rough couple of days.

01:55.686 --> 01:58.154
Moira, why don't we
get to bed, sweetheart?

01:58.188 --> 01:59.956
Ooh, frisky, John.

01:59.990 --> 02:02.458
- Oh! Bye!
- Ewww!

02:02.493 --> 02:05.194
- Eww.
- Ugh!

02:05.229 --> 02:09.764

02:10.808 --> 02:13.910
Moira: No! No one would believe this!

02:14.124 --> 02:15.992
These cannot be real!

02:16.831 --> 02:18.521
What's going on?

02:18.976 --> 02:20.743
Well, instead of sleeping last night,

02:20.777 --> 02:22.678
I decided to just power right through.

02:22.713 --> 02:24.647
You know, best to round
up to an even four days.

02:24.681 --> 02:27.517
And while I was doing
some light reorganization,

02:27.551 --> 02:30.553
I came upon this stack of love letters

02:30.587 --> 02:33.210
written to your father by another woman.

02:33.690 --> 02:37.293
- Okay.
- Best not to be concerned, Alexis.

02:37.327 --> 02:40.763
I'm sure there's a logical
explanation for all of this.

02:40.797 --> 02:43.232
- Sure there is.
- Yes. Some of them!

02:43.267 --> 02:45.067
Some of them are even funny!

02:45.102 --> 02:47.904
Listen. Where's that one? Oh! Read this.

02:53.110 --> 02:55.344
"Dearest John-John,

02:55.379 --> 02:57.613
I'm lying here, stuck, sweaty.

02:57.648 --> 02:59.615
All I can think about is you,

02:59.650 --> 03:01.183
and the last night we spent together,

03:01.225 --> 03:02.725
bed shaking... " Ew!

03:02.750 --> 03:04.083
Why are you making me read this?

03:04.121 --> 03:05.788
- I know, right?
- Eugh!

03:05.822 --> 03:07.423
Before your father met me,

03:07.457 --> 03:09.091
he was not quite so selective.

03:09.126 --> 03:11.727
I hesitate to add, he
even had a predilection

03:11.762 --> 03:13.863
for boom boom girls!

03:14.153 --> 03:15.464
Okay, I would like to remind you

03:15.499 --> 03:17.433
that I don't have a therapist anymore.

03:17.467 --> 03:18.968
No, as you said,

03:19.002 --> 03:21.337
there's a logical
explanation for all of this.

03:21.371 --> 03:24.373
No, you've said that
like, three times now.

03:24.408 --> 03:26.208
So I think it's probably for the best

03:26.243 --> 03:28.932
that we put these down,
and we go have a nap, okay?

03:28.957 --> 03:30.746
- Yes. You're right.
- Mhm.

03:30.781 --> 03:33.316
You're right, Alexis,
you're always so right.

03:35.352 --> 03:37.219
Okay.

03:37.254 --> 03:40.189
All right...

03:43.060 --> 03:46.062
Just a few more, just
to lull me to sleep.

03:46.096 --> 03:47.286
That's all.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.149 --> 03:57.249
Good morning.

03:57.441 --> 03:59.108
Is there something I can help you with?

03:59.142 --> 04:00.820
Yeah, I'd like you to
open your cash register,

04:00.844 --> 04:02.345
and give me your money!

04:02.379 --> 04:04.020
Okay, small problem.

04:04.045 --> 04:07.106
Um, our money isn't for sale.

04:07.727 --> 04:10.629
- I'm robbing you!
- Thought so, yeah. Um...

04:10.654 --> 04:12.965
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

04:13.390 --> 04:16.425
Hey! Hey! Where do you
think you're going?!

04:16.459 --> 04:19.428
- Here.
- David: So here's the problem.

04:19.463 --> 04:21.430
Our till doesn't currently
have any cash in it,

04:21.464 --> 04:22.642
because my partner is at the bank

04:22.667 --> 04:25.002
getting money for the float.

04:25.035 --> 04:26.636
What about you, what do you have?

04:26.670 --> 04:28.379
A wallet full of debt.

04:28.939 --> 04:31.474
Can someone put
something in a bag, please?!

04:31.508 --> 04:33.776
Um, we only have cloth
totes, I hope that's okay.

04:33.810 --> 04:35.778
- Whatever!
- Would you like some wine?

04:35.812 --> 04:38.047
Okay, yeah, yes, put
some booze in a bag.

04:38.081 --> 04:40.016
Do you drink red wine, or white wine?

04:40.050 --> 04:42.118
Maybe some chilled rose in the back?

04:42.152 --> 04:43.038
I'll get it!

04:43.063 --> 04:44.864
Robber: I'm not letting
you go into the back!

04:44.888 --> 04:46.756
What else?

04:46.790 --> 04:49.158
Cheese goes good with wine.

04:49.192 --> 04:50.860
Suddenly she's a sales associate.

04:50.894 --> 04:52.461
Would you like some cheese?

04:52.496 --> 04:54.563
Uh yeah, I'll take some cheese.

04:54.598 --> 04:55.642
God forbid he be specific.

04:55.666 --> 04:57.800
I guess throw in some brie,

04:57.834 --> 04:59.135
some aged cheddar.

04:59.169 --> 05:01.203
Uh, that tapenade goes
good with the brie.

05:01.238 --> 05:02.838
Tapenades, great, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:02.873 --> 05:05.878
- Do you have bad skin?
- Yeah, sure, just hurry it up!

05:08.650 --> 05:10.251
There you go.

05:15.085 --> 05:16.295
Could you help the man with the door?

05:16.329 --> 05:18.130
- His hands are full.
- Sorry.

05:18.155 --> 05:20.523
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

05:24.153 --> 05:25.953
Why do I feel like
we did something wrong?

05:31.201 --> 05:33.836
Look at you all dressed
up, Mr. Sporty Spice.

05:33.870 --> 05:35.871
Uh yeah, I'm dressed for the run

05:35.906 --> 05:37.250
that we're supposed to be going on,

05:37.274 --> 05:40.088
but I don't think you can run in those.

05:40.477 --> 05:43.479
Tell that to me at
21, escaping the yakuza.

05:43.513 --> 05:45.205
So that's a no on the run, then?

05:45.230 --> 05:46.826
Okay, honestly Ted,
I've had a very traumatic

05:46.850 --> 05:48.884
morning at home, so
going on a run is like,

05:48.919 --> 05:52.121
the last thing that I
wanna do. Also, I forgot.

05:52.155 --> 05:53.889
Okay well, that's
actually like, scary,

05:53.924 --> 05:56.092
because we texted about
it twice last night,

05:56.126 --> 05:59.095
and twice this morning, but anyway,

05:59.129 --> 06:00.629
is everything okay?

06:00.664 --> 06:02.575
Like, other than reading
some very porny love letters

06:02.599 --> 06:04.967
that someone sent my dad, sure.

06:05.001 --> 06:06.869
Like, who holds on to things like that?

06:06.903 --> 06:08.938
I've held on to some things.

06:08.972 --> 06:10.606
Oh my God, should I be worried?

06:10.640 --> 06:12.475
Well, I, I did keep this waterproof watch

06:12.517 --> 06:13.951
that Heather gave me.

06:13.977 --> 06:16.472
Okay, I asked if I should be worried.

06:17.414 --> 06:18.891
I don't know, I think
it's kind of romantic

06:18.915 --> 06:20.783
to hang on to things
from old relationships.

06:20.817 --> 06:23.452
I've certainly kept some
things from our past.

06:24.755 --> 06:26.555
Ted!

06:26.590 --> 06:28.136
I take it that you haven't?

06:28.658 --> 06:31.761
Um, harsh. I for sure have.

06:31.795 --> 06:33.963
Yeah, it's just
that your face is doing

06:33.997 --> 06:35.308
some really weird stuff right now.

06:35.332 --> 06:37.967
No... because you put me on the spot!

06:38.001 --> 06:40.536
There's like, a very long
list of things that I've kept.

06:40.570 --> 06:42.338
Oh, really.

06:42.372 --> 06:43.806
Like what?

06:43.840 --> 06:47.443
Like... that empty
book that you gave me.

06:48.274 --> 06:51.413
- The journal?
- Yes! The journal.

06:51.448 --> 06:55.961
And very likely some jewelry.

06:55.986 --> 06:59.965
Like a ring, or...

06:59.990 --> 07:02.525
- A locket?
- Yes.

07:02.559 --> 07:04.426
The locket you gave me.

07:04.461 --> 07:06.028
I kept that the most.

07:06.062 --> 07:07.163
Oh yeah, it's just funny,

07:07.197 --> 07:08.898
I don't think I've
ever seen you wear it.

07:08.932 --> 07:11.400
I'm just so scared of losing it.

07:11.434 --> 07:13.102
That makes sense.

07:13.136 --> 07:15.204
Okay, well, you have a run to go on,

07:15.238 --> 07:18.974
so I should probably go
and update my journal.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.453
You've never written
in a journal, have you?

07:20.477 --> 07:22.077
No, but um,

07:22.112 --> 07:24.046
one time I did do a book
report on David's diary,

07:24.071 --> 07:26.239
and it was very dark. Okay.

07:33.190 --> 07:34.857
Jocelyn!

07:34.891 --> 07:36.959
Moira, you're back.

07:36.993 --> 07:38.894
Did you just let yourself in?

07:38.929 --> 07:41.230
I have been knocking on your door

07:41.264 --> 07:43.032
since the beginning of time!

07:43.066 --> 07:44.377
Although now that I'm standing here,

07:44.401 --> 07:46.402
it's equally possible
that I didn't knock at all.

07:46.436 --> 07:48.170
I suppose we'll never know, will we?

07:48.196 --> 07:50.573
Ah! Sorry. I just need to...

07:50.607 --> 07:53.142
- catch my breath.
- Oh, as do I.

07:53.176 --> 07:55.477
I don't know if you know
what it's like to be mortally

07:55.512 --> 07:57.546
deprived of one's sleep!

07:57.581 --> 07:59.481
I haven't slept in eight months.

07:59.516 --> 08:02.117
- Why's that?
- Because of the baby.

08:02.152 --> 08:04.987
I've had a bit of a
rebirth myself, in Bosnia.

08:05.021 --> 08:07.056
I hope it wasn't as painful as mine.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.624
The music, Jocelyn.

08:08.658 --> 08:12.221
In Bosni-wood, as the industry
will soon be calling it,

08:12.762 --> 08:16.131
I... I picked up some beautiful Sevdah,

08:16.166 --> 08:19.969
that I absolutely must
teach to the Jazzigals!

08:20.003 --> 08:21.837
Would you like to hear me sing

08:21.872 --> 08:23.775
a traditional love song?

08:23.800 --> 08:26.508
I - I would, it's just
the baby's sleeping, so...

08:26.543 --> 08:28.577
Shhh...

08:47.581 --> 08:50.324
Yeah... it's a sad one.

08:51.334 --> 08:54.169
I would be feeling it too, if I knew...

08:54.204 --> 08:56.448
what the heck you were singing about.

08:59.075 --> 09:00.229
Oh...

09:01.878 --> 09:02.878
What are these?

09:02.913 --> 09:06.448
Oh, just some old love letters,

09:06.862 --> 09:07.917
written by another woman,

09:07.951 --> 09:10.786
onto which John has been clutching.

09:10.820 --> 09:14.112
Wow, I have been down this road.

09:14.624 --> 09:18.827
I once found a bag of
Roland's ex-girlfriends' bras.

09:19.996 --> 09:21.284
Burned them.

09:21.631 --> 09:23.666
Except for the ones that were my size.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.734
But this is incomparable, Jocelyn,

09:25.769 --> 09:29.905
there's a perfectly logical
explanation for this!

09:29.940 --> 09:31.573
Oh, there always is.

09:32.366 --> 09:35.077
Woo! Wow.

09:35.111 --> 09:38.414
This little "butterfly"
is quite the writer.

09:38.448 --> 09:41.483
It's like 50 Shades of Johnny Rose!

09:41.518 --> 09:43.052
Holy cow.

09:46.756 --> 09:48.757
You know, I've never
been robbed before,

09:48.792 --> 09:50.526
and I had friends
that lived in Brooklyn.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.829
Yeah... that was a robbery, right?

09:53.863 --> 09:56.532
I mean, we were robbed.

09:56.566 --> 09:58.032
Right?
Yeah!

09:58.057 --> 10:00.235
Someone walked out of here
with two bags of product,

10:00.270 --> 10:02.371
I mean, I don't know
what else you'd call it.

10:03.473 --> 10:06.041
I mean, he had a weapon, right?

10:06.076 --> 10:08.077
Yeah! Yes.

10:08.111 --> 10:09.745
I mean, it must've been in his pocket,

10:09.779 --> 10:11.547
because he used both
hands to carry the bags

10:11.581 --> 10:13.282
out of the store, but...

10:16.886 --> 10:19.388
I can't believe you
just offered him the wine.

10:19.422 --> 10:20.766
You offered him the skincare, I mean,

10:20.790 --> 10:22.435
we don't know what was
going on under that mask!

10:22.459 --> 10:24.326
He could've had perfect skin.

10:24.361 --> 10:25.728
I can't believe this happened,

10:25.762 --> 10:27.628
I was gone for like, 45 minutes.

10:28.406 --> 10:30.440
Are you guys sure you're okay?

10:30.743 --> 10:32.210
Surprisingly, yes.

10:32.235 --> 10:33.769
- Yeah, I'm not.
- Thanks.

10:33.803 --> 10:35.537
I'm very startled.

10:35.572 --> 10:36.682
It just doesn't make any sense.

10:36.706 --> 10:38.707
I mean, I can understand
taking the wine,

10:38.742 --> 10:41.730
but who steals a jar of tapenade?

10:42.912 --> 10:44.980
- And the brie?!
- Yeah, the brie.

10:45.015 --> 10:47.216
Stevie? The brie?

10:47.250 --> 10:50.819
Well, at least we know
if the cops don't get him,

10:50.986 --> 10:52.862
his cholesterol will.

10:53.056 --> 10:54.700
Well, there's no need to
keep talking about it now.

10:54.724 --> 10:56.702
You guys are gonna have to
go through this all again

10:56.726 --> 10:58.627
in much more detail
when the police get here.

11:00.228 --> 11:01.565
Yeah, I um,

11:01.931 --> 11:03.766
I don't know if going
to the police is...

11:03.800 --> 11:05.968
is necessary at this point.

11:06.002 --> 11:07.503
If we want any insurance money

11:07.537 --> 11:08.781
for the things that were stolen,

11:08.805 --> 11:10.620
you have to explain
everything to the police.

11:10.907 --> 11:12.908
I was pretty much in the back

11:12.942 --> 11:14.370
while all of this was going down, so...

11:14.544 --> 11:17.611
Mm, I remember you being
pretty involved, actually.

11:17.636 --> 11:18.881
Yeah well, between the two of you,

11:18.915 --> 11:20.816
I'm pretty sure you
can piece it together.

11:20.850 --> 11:23.485
Yeah. Right? So...

11:32.488 --> 11:33.955
Hey, Twy?

11:33.990 --> 11:36.191
I've always admired your jewelry game.

11:36.225 --> 11:37.469
You just like, pick a few pieces,

11:37.493 --> 11:39.761
and just and wear them to death.

11:39.796 --> 11:42.164
Oh, if you're talking about
my earrings the clasp broke,

11:42.198 --> 11:45.233
so I actually physically
cannot take them off.

11:45.268 --> 11:47.769
Okay, I am experiencing
the same problem.

11:47.804 --> 11:49.980
All of my jewelry is boring.

11:50.273 --> 11:51.773
Is that what I said?

11:51.808 --> 11:54.309
So way back when, all
of my girlfriends and I

11:54.344 --> 11:56.188
used to throw the diamonds
we got from our parents

11:56.212 --> 11:59.047
on a table, and just do
like, a big jewelry swap.

12:00.550 --> 12:03.049
I wish I had someone
in this town to swap with.

12:03.074 --> 12:04.908
Yeah, I used to think
that a lot growing up,

12:04.942 --> 12:07.043
when I'd see other kids
with their families.

12:08.079 --> 12:10.080
Okay, you just gave me a great idea!

12:10.114 --> 12:12.516
Why don't we do a jewelry swap?

12:13.518 --> 12:15.218
Well, I do have a large collection

12:15.253 --> 12:17.020
of my grandfather's hospital bracelets.

12:17.054 --> 12:19.623
Yum! Um, but I also love

12:19.657 --> 12:21.791
that cute little
locket around your neck.

12:21.826 --> 12:22.959
Well, that makes sense,

12:22.994 --> 12:24.505
because you gave it to me for Christmas,

12:24.529 --> 12:26.196
and I wear it every day.

12:26.230 --> 12:28.164
Yeah, and I always think like,

12:28.199 --> 12:29.966
what would I look like in it?

12:30.751 --> 12:33.219
S... so do you want the locket?

12:33.244 --> 12:35.279
No, Twy, I got it for you.

12:35.573 --> 12:38.041
But what I'm saying
is, let's swap for it.

12:38.075 --> 12:40.944
I have a toe ring that
would look so cute on you!

12:40.987 --> 12:45.050
We're not allowed to wear
open-toed shoes, but um...

12:45.783 --> 12:47.217
maybe I could...

12:47.242 --> 12:48.910
take that bracelet?

12:49.928 --> 12:54.031
Yes! Um, I actually got this
in a swap with Sienna Miller.

12:54.058 --> 12:56.626
And by that I mean it fell off
her wrist at a Halloween party,

12:56.661 --> 12:58.161
and I kept it.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.894
Well, maybe I could come
over on my lunch break,

12:59.919 --> 13:01.653
and we can swap some more stuff!

13:01.933 --> 13:04.234
Yes, Twy!

13:04.268 --> 13:05.746
I mean, I actually
thought this would be like,

13:05.770 --> 13:07.237
a one-for-one situation,

13:07.271 --> 13:09.205
but if you want to open it up...

13:09.240 --> 13:11.218
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, that's okay, I got it.

13:11.242 --> 13:13.402
No, the necklace.

13:14.178 --> 13:15.979
Oh, right now?

13:16.004 --> 13:17.004
Okay...

13:26.223 --> 13:28.458
- What are you doing?
- Uh...

13:28.492 --> 13:30.226
word on the street is that

13:30.261 --> 13:32.753
you're in a little hot
water with Moira, huh?

13:33.164 --> 13:35.332
No, everything's fine with Moira.

13:35.366 --> 13:37.601
I just thought she was coming in today.

13:37.635 --> 13:41.004
Look Johnny, everybody likes
to take trips down memory lane,

13:41.038 --> 13:44.174
but you gotta get rid of the evidence.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.142
Do you know what a burnt
under-wire smells like?

13:46.177 --> 13:47.184
Okay, Roland,

13:47.209 --> 13:49.613
I actually don't know
what you're talking about.

13:49.647 --> 13:51.982
Those spicy letters
from Miss Butterfly

13:52.016 --> 13:54.117
that you left out for Moira to find.

13:54.151 --> 13:56.186
How do you know about those letters?

13:56.220 --> 13:58.788
Well, Moira's out
showing 'em around town.

13:58.823 --> 14:00.290
Jocelyn's read 'em.

14:00.324 --> 14:03.827
She told me about some
very racy parts, young man.

14:03.861 --> 14:05.795
Moira is showing my letters?

14:05.830 --> 14:07.174
Yeah, I was talking to Bob about it.

14:07.198 --> 14:09.399
Why were you talking to Bob about it?!

14:09.433 --> 14:11.801
We're trying to save
your marriage, bud!

14:11.836 --> 14:14.137
Although, Gwen thinks
it's probably a lost cause.

14:14.171 --> 14:16.406
She's thinks you might be a sexaholic.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.540
Okay, first of all,

14:17.575 --> 14:19.209
everyone should mind their own business,

14:19.243 --> 14:20.877
and stay out of my affairs.

14:20.911 --> 14:23.213
Affairs, plural? Oh.

14:23.247 --> 14:24.914
There's no affair, okay?

14:24.949 --> 14:27.117
Now, would you unlock the
door, and open the blind?

14:27.151 --> 14:30.220
Jeez, Johnny, I'm on your side, pal.

14:30.254 --> 14:31.888
Unless things get messy,

14:31.922 --> 14:33.823
in that case, I'm gonna
be on Moira's side.

14:37.128 --> 14:38.762
So I guess it was sort of like a...

14:38.796 --> 14:41.097
a low end poly-blend hooded sweatshirt,

14:41.132 --> 14:44.393
in what I could only describe
as an aubergine color.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.170
And just in case
he changes his outfit,

14:47.204 --> 14:50.507
do you have a rough idea
of his physical description?

14:50.541 --> 14:52.475
Right, um...

14:52.510 --> 14:54.642
Well, I guess, my build.

14:55.112 --> 14:57.380
- That's being generous.
- If I was at my goal weight.

14:57.415 --> 14:59.735
Officer, they mentioned
there was a weapon involved.

15:00.151 --> 15:01.918
Can you describe the weapon?

15:01.952 --> 15:03.319
You describe it.

15:03.354 --> 15:06.756
Well, if there was a
weapon, it was concealed.

15:06.791 --> 15:09.492
Yeah, so you know, it's...
it's sort of hard to describe

15:09.527 --> 15:11.361
a concealed weapon.

15:11.395 --> 15:14.731
Yeah, I mean, if we could
tell you what it looked like,

15:14.765 --> 15:17.167
he wouldn't be doing a
good job of concealing it.

15:17.201 --> 15:18.401
Yeah!

15:18.436 --> 15:20.070
So let me get this straight.

15:20.104 --> 15:21.805
You have no idea what it looks like,

15:21.839 --> 15:24.240
or whether there was
one in the first place.

15:24.275 --> 15:26.076
You guys said you were held up!

15:26.110 --> 15:27.544
Emotionally!

15:27.578 --> 15:29.179
I mean, I don't know if there was a gun,

15:29.213 --> 15:31.347
but it was still a robbery,
he was wearing a mask.

15:31.382 --> 15:34.884
And would we all not agree
that words are weapons?!

15:34.919 --> 15:37.854
Okay, so you offered the wine,

15:37.888 --> 15:39.923
and you offered the
cheese and the tapenade,

15:39.957 --> 15:41.386
and there was no gun?

15:41.587 --> 15:43.955
This guy just sounds like
a lucky customer, David!

15:44.161 --> 15:46.262
You know what? I am just gonna...

15:46.297 --> 15:48.732
file this report, and you can follow up

15:48.757 --> 15:51.092
if you have any more information.

15:52.336 --> 15:53.870
Yes...

15:59.043 --> 16:00.706
So you upsold the robber.

16:01.278 --> 16:03.413
I did not! I didn't even tell him

16:03.447 --> 16:06.182
about the vintage wines
we have in the back.

16:06.217 --> 16:07.517
Oh. Stevie: Speaking of...

16:07.551 --> 16:10.353
I think we should probably
open one of those bottles,

16:10.387 --> 16:12.555
just to calm the nerves.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.447
Yeah, I thought
you had to go to work.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.335
Great. Great stuff, you guys.

16:23.479 --> 16:25.345
- Can I have some more popcorn?
- Oh, sure.

16:25.369 --> 16:27.103
Oh, don't worry, I'll get it.

16:29.707 --> 16:32.575
I uh, see you're wearing the locket.

16:32.610 --> 16:34.577
Oh! I don't know, am I?

16:34.612 --> 16:36.012
Oh, right.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.215
Well, you proved me wrong, Alexis.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.727
And I have to say, I'm
actually kind of relieved,

16:40.751 --> 16:42.729
because that means that you
also kept favourite photo

16:42.753 --> 16:44.053
of the two of us.

16:44.088 --> 16:47.023
I keep that photo in a
locked folder on my phone.

16:47.057 --> 16:49.125
No, no, I'm talking
about the one in the locket.

16:52.063 --> 16:53.490
Hmm!

16:54.298 --> 16:58.592
Now, this appears to
be a photo of Twyla?

16:59.537 --> 17:01.471
Yes... I put that there.

17:02.540 --> 17:05.208
Because Twyla is an important friend.

17:05.364 --> 17:07.398
And Twyla's mom?

17:07.778 --> 17:09.045
Is her important friend.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.757
You gave the locket
to Twyla, didn't you?

17:10.781 --> 17:12.415
Okay, I would've kept it.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.859
But the necklace just kept reminding me

17:13.884 --> 17:15.518
of all the bad things that I'd done,

17:15.553 --> 17:16.797
and then Twyla gave me a Christmas gift,

17:16.820 --> 17:18.298
and I didn't have
anything to give her...

17:18.321 --> 17:20.690
Okay, Alexis, I think
we should just agree

17:20.723 --> 17:22.625
to stop feeling bad about our past,

17:22.660 --> 17:24.340
and just focus on the future.

17:25.088 --> 17:26.556
Yes, Ted.

17:26.864 --> 17:28.540
And, in that spirit,

17:28.566 --> 17:30.967
I should probably tell you
that I didn't actually keep

17:31.001 --> 17:32.969
everything that you gave me.

17:33.003 --> 17:34.137
That's fine.

17:34.171 --> 17:36.172
Yeah, after the breakup, I uh...

17:36.207 --> 17:38.408
well, I took some of your
stuff to the incinerator,

17:38.442 --> 17:40.810
along with some pets that
needed to be cremated.

17:40.845 --> 17:42.645
- Ew.
- And you think you feel bad?

17:42.680 --> 17:44.157
The wallet that you gave
me was still in there,

17:44.181 --> 17:45.926
and I had forgotten to
take some of the cards out,

17:45.950 --> 17:49.786
and I was actually only one
stamp away from a free sub, so.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.755
Okay well, if it makes
you feel any better,

17:52.790 --> 17:54.591
that was David's wallet.

18:00.030 --> 18:02.740
Well, well, "John-John" returns.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.236
Okay, Moira, don't tell
me you still haven't slept.

18:06.270 --> 18:07.837
What would give you that impression?

18:07.872 --> 18:09.639
Sweetheart, you've got to find a way

18:09.673 --> 18:11.541
of getting some sleep!

18:11.575 --> 18:13.109
Easier said than done, John,

18:13.143 --> 18:14.844
when your only husband is longing for

18:14.879 --> 18:17.447
his epistle-writing inamorata.

18:17.481 --> 18:19.025
You know what, if
you had taken a nap,

18:19.049 --> 18:20.717
and cleared your head,

18:20.751 --> 18:22.385
instead of running around town

18:22.419 --> 18:24.621
showcasing our personal business...

18:24.655 --> 18:26.856
When we were herded from our home,

18:26.891 --> 18:30.159
and forced to grab what
few precious items we could,

18:30.194 --> 18:32.372
you chose to grab those letters!

18:32.528 --> 18:34.796
- That's right.
- Who is this woman?!

18:36.166 --> 18:38.380
Oh... okay.

18:38.969 --> 18:40.303
If you must know,

18:40.337 --> 18:44.177
she's someone who's
very important to me.

18:44.881 --> 18:45.948
Oh?

18:45.973 --> 18:48.778
Moira, you wrote those letters!

18:48.812 --> 18:51.381
Don't be absurd,
that is not my writing!

18:51.415 --> 18:53.483
It was that week on "Sunrise Bay"

18:53.517 --> 18:55.385
when Vivian Blake had her accident,

18:55.419 --> 18:58.187
you were in a body cast, they
wouldn't let you take it off.

18:58.212 --> 19:00.482
You were writing with your left hand!

19:01.325 --> 19:03.059
The spelunking incident.

19:03.084 --> 19:03.950
No.

19:04.654 --> 19:08.431
It was after she got thrown
upwards through a skylight.

19:08.465 --> 19:10.435
Look...

19:10.734 --> 19:12.235
"I'm lying here in bed,

19:12.269 --> 19:14.671
I can't move, I miss you."

19:14.705 --> 19:15.872
It's all there, Moira.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.107
You're telling me none
of this rings a bell?

19:18.575 --> 19:20.410
In my defense, John,

19:20.444 --> 19:22.245
I had asked for actual painkillers,

19:22.279 --> 19:25.169
to help ease me into
my character's plight.

19:26.551 --> 19:28.485
But why are you reading them now?

19:32.222 --> 19:33.716
I was missing you,

19:34.024 --> 19:35.692
so I took out the letters,

19:35.726 --> 19:37.779
because reading them made me

19:38.032 --> 19:40.233
feel like you were still here with me.

19:40.258 --> 19:42.025
Oh, you're too sweet.

19:44.435 --> 19:46.179
Unfortunately, we're
going to have to stick with

19:46.203 --> 19:47.971
my version of the events.

19:48.005 --> 19:50.006
What? Why would we do that?

19:50.040 --> 19:52.575
I don't want anyone
thinking I wrote these!

19:52.609 --> 19:54.421
Well, I don't want
people thinking I'm reading

19:54.445 --> 19:56.379
some other woman's love letters!

19:56.413 --> 19:57.847
Well, it'll give you an edge.

19:57.881 --> 20:00.883
No one will ever accuse
you of being vanilla again.

20:03.683 --> 20:05.184
Who's saying that?

20:10.068 --> 20:13.317
No kids, I understand that
you both have read

20:13.342 --> 20:15.466
a somewhat adult-themed correspondence

20:15.491 --> 20:17.607
between a loving wife and her husband?

20:17.678 --> 20:20.380
Yeah, and I'd prefer if you
could stop talking about it.

20:20.414 --> 20:22.616
This is why I think it's
best to torch everything

20:22.650 --> 20:24.638
from past failed relationships.

20:24.663 --> 20:27.554
I'd hardly call this a
failed relationship, David.

20:27.588 --> 20:30.357
We're still here, 35 years later.

20:30.391 --> 20:32.560
Okay, here we go.

20:33.294 --> 20:34.685
I know you asked for a small,

20:34.717 --> 20:37.118
but I "swapped it" for a large.

20:37.145 --> 20:41.281
Twyla, may I say, you
are looking very chic.

20:41.536 --> 20:43.547
Johnny: Would you look at
that? That looks like the tiara

20:43.571 --> 20:46.006
you wore at your bat mitzvah, Alexis.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.622
Well, I had a little
help from a friend.

20:48.876 --> 20:50.443
We should probably coordinate a time

20:50.478 --> 20:51.645
to swap everything back.

20:51.679 --> 20:53.193
Oh, don't worry, I'm fine.

20:54.977 --> 20:58.380
And what exactly did you
get out of this fun swap?

20:58.499 --> 21:01.768
I got Twyla's step-brother's dog tags.

21:01.889 --> 21:04.224
And a whistle. Moira: Caw! Caw!

21:04.258 --> 21:06.092
Oh!

21:07.235 --> 21:09.136
Is she okay?

21:09.530 --> 21:10.997
Yeah, she's just sleeping.

21:11.692 --> 21:13.802
Well, I'm ready to order.

21:14.735 --> 21:16.974
Okay, can somebody close
her eyelids, at least?

21:16.999 --> 21:19.267
Please?

21:19.291 --> 21:24.291
