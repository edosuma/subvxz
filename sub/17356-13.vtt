00:07.508 --> 00:08.640
- ¶

00:08.642 --> 00:13.012
- Guys, get excited!
We're about to watch the news.

00:13.381 --> 00:16.448
- News? Bo-ring!

00:16.617 --> 00:19.118
- Oh, Chloe, it's
the Metroburg Super News.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.186
Max and I were interviewed
about the Z Force

00:21.188 --> 00:22.454
by Anderson Super.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.790
- Anderson only has the best
supes on the show.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.459
He even got to interview
our favorite hero.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.595
- I don't remember
being on his show.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.563
- 'Cause you never were.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.533
I'm talking about a kid hero
named Pause Girl.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.201
- She stops time
and pranks people

00:36.203 --> 00:38.637
by drawing
moustaches on them.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.206
- Oh. I can see how
that's more important

00:41.208 --> 00:43.742
than saving the world
346 times.

00:43.744 --> 00:44.543
[crunching popcorn]

00:44.545 --> 00:46.478
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Connecting to the Metroburg

00:46.480 --> 00:49.481
News Network.
- Ooh, it's starting.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.783
- Being on TV
is so exciting.

00:50.785 --> 00:53.118
I'll try not to let
it go to my head.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.154
- Family, do not make
eye contact with me,

00:55.156 --> 00:58.223
unless you wanna catch
greatness, okay?

00:59.660 --> 01:02.127
- Max, not so much.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.695
- Hello, Metroburg.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.497
Tonight, we profile
two heroes

01:05.499 --> 01:08.300
vying for a spot on
the legendary Z Force--

01:08.302 --> 01:10.335
twins Max
and Phoebe Thunderman.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.637
But the wrinkle
in this cape

01:11.639 --> 01:13.639
is that one of them
used to be evil.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.809
I spoke to Max Thunderman
in his home lair.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.377
- What's he talking
about, Max?

01:18.379 --> 01:20.212
We shot that interview
together in the driveway.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.548
- Yeah, but then I made
Anderson re-shoot it

01:22.550 --> 01:24.149
because your part was...

01:24.151 --> 01:25.851
[laughs]
boring!

01:26.687 --> 01:28.487
- Told ya.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.522
- What...?

01:30.524 --> 01:31.657
- Max, it is a pleasure

01:31.659 --> 01:33.659
to finally meet the man
behind the swoosh.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.662
- [laughs] Please,
I'm just a regular gu--

01:36.664 --> 01:38.263
- Hi, Mom!

01:38.265 --> 01:39.698
Look, I'm on TV!

01:39.700 --> 01:40.833
- [powers whoosh]

01:40.835 --> 01:44.603
- Now, Max, you've gone from
being Dark Mayhem's lap dog

01:44.605 --> 01:47.139
to possibly saving
the world with the Z Force.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.141
- I don't know about
lap dog, I mean--

01:49.143 --> 01:50.142
- But the question remains--

01:50.144 --> 01:51.577
is there anyone
you'd like to thank

01:51.579 --> 01:53.645
for helping you become
the hero you are today?

01:53.647 --> 01:57.416
- Yes, there is.
Someone very important.

01:57.418 --> 02:02.421
Someone who was always there
for me, during my evil phase.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.589
- [tsks]
Aw, Max.

02:03.591 --> 02:07.392
- The person I wanna
thank is...

02:07.394 --> 02:08.894
myself!

02:08.896 --> 02:11.430
- Are you for real?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.664
- I guess that was rude.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.166
I should have
thanked Colosso.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.801
- [high-pitched]
I meant me!

02:15.803 --> 02:17.436
- Why would I thank you?

02:17.438 --> 02:18.871
- Because I spent
my whole life

02:18.873 --> 02:20.706
cleaning up your
evil messes.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.773
If it weren't for me,

02:21.775 --> 02:23.609
you and your swoosh would
be rotting in SuperJail.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.212
- First of all, my swoosh
thrives in confined spaces.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.481
And, second, I don't--
- Can you two zip it?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.517
Anderson said he had
a special announcement.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.319
- ANDERSON: And while we're on
the topic of the Thundermans,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.188
the Supe Awards
are coming up,

02:36.190 --> 02:37.156
and I've just heard that

02:37.158 --> 02:39.491
the Platinum Cape Lifetime
Achievement Award

02:39.493 --> 02:40.893
will be given to...

02:40.895 --> 02:42.561
Thunder Man and Electress.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.729
- HANK:
Ha, ha, hey!

02:43.731 --> 02:46.632
- Yay, Mommy and Daddy!

02:48.235 --> 02:49.201
- What's wrong, Max?

02:49.203 --> 02:52.771
Bummed you didn't get nominated
for SuperJerk of the Year?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.274
- No!

02:55.276 --> 02:57.176
I...just...uh...

02:57.178 --> 02:59.244
Don't follow me!

03:00.381 --> 03:04.550
- Well, now I have
to follow him.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.286
- Hank, the awards
are this weekend,

03:07.288 --> 03:09.488
and I have nothing
to wear.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.522
- Me, neither.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.224
Let's go shopping, baby.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.325
- Ooh, sweetie,
you're too little

03:13.327 --> 03:15.494
to come to the awards with
the rest of the family.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.929
You'll have to stay
home with a babysitter.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.831
- Okay. But I'm still
going shopping.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.567
[whooshes]

03:21.569 --> 03:22.734
- Was that my credit card?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.903
- Hey, Dad, um,
can we stay home with Chloe?

03:24.905 --> 03:27.406
We can't handle sitting through
another long awards show.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.409
- Yeah, it's like you guys
win an award every other week.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.445
- Come on. We haven't
won that many.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.647
- Tell that to
your trophy shelf.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.949
- [wood creaks]

03:36.951 --> 03:38.517
- [awards clattering]

03:38.519 --> 03:43.288
- Look, honey, it buckled under
the weight of our awesomeness.

03:43.290 --> 03:46.592
- Well, I guess if you
really don't wanna come,

03:46.594 --> 03:47.392
we won't force you.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.529
You can stay home with
Chloe and the babysitter.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.663
- Thanks.
Come on, Billy.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.933
- You guys were champion
Flamenco dancers?

03:54.935 --> 03:55.834
- Still are.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.970
- Hit it,
thunder monitor.

03:57.972 --> 04:01.607
- [Flamenco music playing]

04:02.576 --> 04:04.243
- You had to ask.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.677
- [Flamenco music continues]

04:05.679 --> 04:07.546
- I really messed up
this time, Colosso.

04:07.548 --> 04:12.284
- Relax. You'll be fine as long
as Phoebe never finds out.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.286
- As long as
I never find out what?

04:14.288 --> 04:18.457
- You told her not to follow
you again, didn't ya?

04:18.993 --> 04:19.758
- You acted all weird

04:19.760 --> 04:21.560
when Anderson Super announced
mom and dad's award.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.428
Tell me why or I'll do this...
[powers whooshing]

04:23.430 --> 04:25.864
- Ow! My ear! You know
I have sensitive lobes.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.000
- PHOEBE: Spill it!
- Okay, fine!

04:28.002 --> 04:29.334
[groans]

04:29.336 --> 04:33.705
Okay, the reason
I got weird is because

04:33.707 --> 04:35.874
I remembered that
when I was evil,

04:35.876 --> 04:36.975
I set a mega stink
bomb to go off

04:36.977 --> 04:38.844
during this year's
Supe Awards.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.279
- What? How could
you forget that?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.381
- I had a lot of villainous
plans going on back then,

04:42.383 --> 04:44.916
and I couldn't afford
an evil assistant.

04:44.918 --> 04:48.020
- You shoulda told me.
I woulda lent ya mine.

04:48.022 --> 04:52.024
Teddy! Pick up my sailor suit
from the dry cleaners!

04:52.026 --> 04:55.360
- Okay, okay, how bad of a stink
bomb are we talking here?

04:55.362 --> 04:57.029
Like rotten eggs
or wet dog?

04:57.031 --> 04:58.597
- Rotten eggs wrapped
in wet dog,

04:58.599 --> 05:02.801
stuffed with moldy cheese
and dipped in hot sewage.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.604
Everyone in that place will
stink for years to come.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.973
- Max, if the Z Force
finds out about this,

05:07.975 --> 05:09.341
we will never get in.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.108
- What are we gonna do?

05:10.110 --> 05:14.913
- Teddy, order me a kiss-the-
Z Force-goodbye muffin basket.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.618
What? It's totally
for someone else.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.688
- ¶

05:22.690 --> 05:23.789
¶ What you see ¶

05:23.791 --> 05:25.023
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:25.025 --> 05:28.627
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

05:28.629 --> 05:30.329
¶ We fit right in ¶

05:30.331 --> 05:31.563
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

05:31.565 --> 05:33.098
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

05:33.100 --> 05:34.800
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

05:34.802 --> 05:36.702
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

05:36.704 --> 05:38.637
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

05:38.639 --> 05:40.038
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

05:40.040 --> 05:41.640
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

05:41.642 --> 05:43.542
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

05:43.544 --> 05:44.976
¶ It's our reality ¶

05:44.978 --> 05:46.078
¶ Just your average family ¶

05:46.080 --> 05:49.715
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

05:49.717 --> 05:53.985
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

05:56.890 --> 05:57.756
- MAX:
Keep looking.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.891
Without those designs, we can't
disable the stink bomb.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.626
- [groans]
The Supe Awards are tonight

06:01.628 --> 06:03.328
and the only stinky
thing I found

06:03.330 --> 06:05.030
is Colosso's dance unitard.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.033
- Hey, hands off
my sparkly diaper.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.768
- I can't remember
where I put them.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.669
You know, when I
became good,

06:10.671 --> 06:13.305
I had to sweep a lot of
my evil past under the rug.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.040
- Well, did you
look under the rug?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.743
- Phoebe, that'd be
way too obvious.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.014
- Oh, hey,
look what I found.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.150
Amazing. Even when
you're good,

06:25.152 --> 06:27.652
I'm still cleaning up
your evil messes.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.388
And your bunny's messes.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.723
Buy a tiny hamper!

06:31.925 --> 06:34.960
- Oh, no! I built it with
a ThunderTanium casing.

06:34.962 --> 06:38.797
The only thing that can disable
it is an electro-plasma blast.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.198
- Okay, so make one.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.233
- [laughing]

06:41.235 --> 06:43.635
She thinks you
can just make one.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.771
Wait! Can you make one?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.072
- I don't have
anything capable

06:47.074 --> 06:48.340
of generating
that type of energy--

06:48.342 --> 06:51.943
unless you have some super-
powerful weapons lying around.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.045
- Like the ones
in the Thundermans'

06:54.047 --> 06:55.046
secret weapons vault.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.915
- MAX & COLOSSO: Thundermans'
secret weapons vault?

06:56.917 --> 07:01.720
- Oh, guess we can drop
"secret" from the name now.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.889
- All right, kids,
we're heading out

07:03.891 --> 07:04.890
to the pre-Supe
Awards party.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.959
This is your last chance
to come to the show to see us--

07:07.961 --> 07:08.860
- NORA & BILLY:
We're good.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.363
- Are you sure? Because
this award is gonna be really--

07:11.365 --> 07:12.764
- NORA & BILLY:
We're good.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.901
- Well, I guess we should
call that fancy super-sitter

07:15.903 --> 07:16.701
the Hero League got us.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.304
- Yes, they say he's
the best in the business.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.273
- He's also free.

07:21.442 --> 07:25.744
Now, I've just gotta push
this baby monitor and...

07:27.181 --> 07:30.282
- SuperNanny
at your service.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.750
- Cool! How'd you
do that?

07:31.752 --> 07:35.086
- Monitor travel is one
of my babysitting powers.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.721
Others include
creating toys

07:36.723 --> 07:39.057
and disinfecting
playground equipment--

07:39.059 --> 07:41.326
with my mind.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.796
- Oh, ho, Chloe
is gonna love you.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.397
I'll get her.

07:45.399 --> 07:48.266
- Please, allow me
to fetch the girl.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.869
Jumpity-bumpity-boom!

07:51.405 --> 07:54.039
Who's up for a bounce?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.908
- [whooshes]
Bouncy House!

07:57.311 --> 08:01.446
- Okay. Bye, Chloe.
We'll miss you.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.183
She doesn't care.
Let's go.

08:05.452 --> 08:09.921
- Thundermans,
getting awa-a-a-a-rds!

08:10.724 --> 08:13.992
- You must be very
excited for your parents.

08:13.994 --> 08:14.993
They're going to
be recognized

08:14.995 --> 08:17.195
by Metroburg's
finest heroes--

08:17.197 --> 08:20.765
Cake Man, Super Viking,
Pause Girl.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.801
- NORA & BILLY:
Pause Girl!

08:22.803 --> 08:23.468
- Yes, Pause Girl.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.938
I hear it's the first awards
show she's ever attended.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.908
- Hey, SuperNanny,
watch me jump.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.310
- Coming, young Miss.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.179
- We blew it.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.747
If we don't go
to those awards,

08:35.749 --> 08:38.183
we may never have another
chance to meet Pause Girl.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.452
- I was thinking
the same thing.

08:40.454 --> 08:43.154
- To the Supe Awards!

08:44.124 --> 08:45.090
What are these?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.324
- Another one of my powers

08:46.326 --> 08:48.193
is keeping kids
on a short leash.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.462
I've never had a child
run away on me.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.931
- Well, Billy has
super-speed. Go, Billy!

08:52.933 --> 08:54.900
- BILLY:
[zooms]

08:55.402 --> 08:56.768
Owww...

08:56.770 --> 08:59.504
- Or we can stay.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.375
- The Thundermans'
secret weapons vault

09:03.377 --> 09:04.342
is in the fireplace?

09:04.344 --> 09:05.810
- Yeah. I can't even
tell you about

09:05.812 --> 09:07.812
the secret ThunderCopter
in the attic.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.482
Dang it, I am just
off today.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.386
- [tiles beeping]

09:16.490 --> 09:18.256
- PHOEBE: These are the most
dangerous weapons

09:18.258 --> 09:21.092
our family has collected
over the years.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.961
- Hey, remember this?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.930
It's the booger blaster
I made in junior high.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.232
- Yes, Max, I remember
the day the cafeteria

09:27.234 --> 09:29.968
served Chicken Snot Pie.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.037
Hey, what about this?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.506
- The orb containing all
of Dark Mayhem's powers?

09:34.508 --> 09:36.942
- Yeah, we could
transfer his powers

09:36.944 --> 09:38.109
from the orb
into one of us,

09:38.111 --> 09:41.079
and then use his plasma balls
to destroy the stink bomb.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.080
- Are you out
of your mind?

09:42.082 --> 09:45.517
- Ha, that's weird. I'm usually
the one saying that to you.

09:45.519 --> 09:47.152
- Dark Mayhem's powers
are pure evil.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.321
If we use it,
we could turn evil.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.856
Huh, that sounds like
something you would say, too.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.825
How do you live
like this?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.560
- Max, that orb might
be the only way

09:55.562 --> 09:57.362
to save our
Z Force chances.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.129
- It's too dangerous.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.265
Besides, I think I can use
a few of these weapons

10:00.267 --> 10:02.534
to build an electro-
plasma blaster.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.169
- The awards start
in an hour.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.571
- Phoebe, relax.
I'm a professional.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.374
- [laser blasts]
- [glass shatters]

10:09.376 --> 10:11.910
- We might need
a new microwave.

10:12.879 --> 10:19.851
- ¶

10:20.587 --> 10:22.320
- I'm hungry,
SuperNanny.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.457
- Then prepare for
some tasty weather.

10:25.459 --> 10:29.094
- [thunder rumbling]

10:32.032 --> 10:33.331
- Tater tots!

10:33.333 --> 10:36.001
Dreams do come true!

10:36.169 --> 10:38.436
- Billy, we have to
meet Pause Girl.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.371
You know what we need?

10:39.373 --> 10:43.441
- Yep, an invisible dinosaur
with a taste for mischief.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.442
- What? No.

10:44.444 --> 10:48.213
- Good, 'cause I definitely
don't have one of those.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.349
Shhh, quiet, Francine.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.652
- I'm talking
about Colosso.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.020
He can distract SuperNanny

10:55.022 --> 10:56.588
with one of his weird
fashion lectures.

10:56.590 --> 11:00.225
- Someone request
a fashion lecture?

11:01.561 --> 11:04.195
- How did you get
ready so fast?

11:04.197 --> 11:05.930
- I was born ready.

11:05.932 --> 11:10.035
- SuperNanny, behold,
Dr. Colosso.

11:10.037 --> 11:13.338
- Today's topic--
the kimono.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.341
But, first, Japanese
pop dance break!

11:16.343 --> 11:20.512
- [lively pop
music playing]

11:20.514 --> 11:23.281
- This is a train wreck...

11:23.283 --> 11:26.518
but I...can't...
look away.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.620
- Why would you want to?

11:28.622 --> 11:31.356
- Nora, this is
getting very strange.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.525
- BILLY & NORA:
[zooming]

11:33.527 --> 11:35.960
- Oh! They're gone!

11:35.962 --> 11:39.998
Nobody sneaks out on Super-
Nanny and gets away with it.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.967
- And nobody
interrupts my dance.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.969
Now I have to start over.

11:44.971 --> 11:48.707
- [lively pop
music playing]

11:52.112 --> 11:53.712
- ¶

11:53.714 --> 11:56.181
- Hurry up, Max.
We've gotta go.

11:56.183 --> 11:59.250
- You can't rush
handsome, Phoebs.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.352
- Come on, you're supposed
to be working on the machine

12:01.354 --> 12:04.089
that's gonna save our future,
not working on your hair.

12:04.091 --> 12:07.258
- Phoebe, my hair
is the future.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.228
And I care just as much
about the Z Force as you.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.997
That's why I made this.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.001
- What's with the lemons?

12:17.003 --> 12:19.738
- Lemons contain
electro-plasmic energy.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.139
I figured out a way
to harness it

12:21.141 --> 12:22.006
into a concentrated blast.

12:22.008 --> 12:26.010
- Great. So, our entire future
depends on a lemonade maker?!

12:26.012 --> 12:30.381
- Just for that
you don't get any.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.419
That is not good.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.022
- I have to come up
with a better plan.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.357
- No, you don't, Phoebe.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.093
Your days of cleaning up
my evil messes are over.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.328
- So, you admit it.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.696
- Yeah, sure I admit it.

12:44.698 --> 12:45.597
I have no problem
saying it.

12:45.599 --> 12:49.167
Just not on TV or in
front of anyone else.

12:49.169 --> 12:49.701
- Why not?

12:49.703 --> 12:52.437
- Because it's embarrassing
you had to save my butt

12:52.439 --> 12:54.572
all those times
when I was a villain.

12:54.574 --> 12:55.740
I'm a superhero now.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.776
I should be able to
save my own butt.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.512
- Can you stop saying butt?
- No.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.381
You've gotta let me
fix this, Phoebs.

13:03.383 --> 13:07.051
And let me use
the words I love.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.020
Butt!

13:10.624 --> 13:11.489
- [sighing]

13:11.491 --> 13:13.258
All right, if it means
that much to you,

13:13.260 --> 13:15.560
then, fine,
we'll do it your way.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.728
- Thanks.

13:16.730 --> 13:17.629
- [horn honks]

13:17.631 --> 13:19.631
- That's the SuperLimo.
Let's go.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.466
- Okay. Oh, uh...

13:21.468 --> 13:22.367
I forgot my phone.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.469
- All right, hurry up.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.672
- Sorry, Max.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.540
- [tiles beeping]

13:28.542 --> 13:32.310
- This is another one of your
messes I've gotta clean up...

13:35.749 --> 13:38.149
with a little help
from Dark Mayhem.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.352
- [dramatic music]

13:50.831 --> 13:55.733
- ¶

13:55.735 --> 13:57.569
- Okay, the stink
bomb's hidden

13:57.571 --> 13:59.437
in a room underneath
the stage.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.638
I got the idea
from Dark Mayhem.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.242
- I didn't get
anything from Dark Mayhem!

14:04.244 --> 14:06.578
- Okay. Follow me.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.381
- Look, mom and dad are being
interviewed by Anderson Super.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.818
- So, Anderson, I'm gonna be
real classy and not bring up

14:13.820 --> 14:16.254
that you've never had
me in for an interview.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.857
- You just brought it up.
- BARB: [laughs]

14:18.859 --> 14:22.827
Please don't air that part.
- We're live.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.867
- Okay, the only way
to the room

14:28.869 --> 14:31.502
is through that trap door,
so, play it cool.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.271
- Okay.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.275
Hi, Super President Kickbutt!
We're playing it cool!

14:37.577 --> 14:41.479
- Phoebe. Max.
You two look nice.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.348
Max, what's under
your cape?

14:43.350 --> 14:45.850
- What's under
your cape?

14:46.686 --> 14:48.319
- What? What?

14:48.321 --> 14:50.855
- BOTH:
Uhhhhhhhhhh...

14:50.857 --> 14:53.291
- PHOEBE: [powers whooshing]
- MAN: [gasps]

14:53.293 --> 14:55.727
- [dishes clattering]

14:55.996 --> 15:00.331
- Mitch! This happens
at every awards show!

15:05.505 --> 15:07.839
- Great. Where are
the stink bombs?

15:07.841 --> 15:09.307
And why's there
a toilet in here?

15:09.309 --> 15:13.511
- The toilet is the stink bomb.
It's an evil metaphor.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.314
- You'd better open it.
I'm not touching that thing.

15:16.316 --> 15:16.948
- Me, neither--

15:16.950 --> 15:19.851
which is why
it's voice activated.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.819
It's potty time.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.062
All right, time to charge
up my lemon blaster

15:31.064 --> 15:33.698
and get the plasma goin'.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.667
- [buttons beeping]

15:35.669 --> 15:36.868
- [grunts of effort]

15:36.870 --> 15:40.004
Come on, baby!
Work for Maxie!

15:40.006 --> 15:42.640
[grunts of effort]

15:42.642 --> 15:44.876
- Max, um, you're not
gonna be happy about this.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.611
But there's something
I have to do.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.048
- Uh, you know it's not
a working toilet, right?

15:50.050 --> 15:51.616
- No, I mean I...

15:51.618 --> 15:53.751
- [motor starts]
- Wahoo!

15:53.753 --> 15:55.353
It'll be fully
charged soon.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.957
- Oh, guess I'll
hold it in.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.759
- TMI, Phoebe.

16:03.697 --> 16:04.629
- BILLY & NORA:
[zooming]

16:04.631 --> 16:07.932
- Let's find Pause Girl before
Mom and Dad realize we're here.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.035
- Our feet are stuck
to the ground.

16:11.037 --> 16:14.906
- Indeed, they are.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.641
Because you two
are grounded.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.676
[laughs]
Cheeky, right?

16:18.678 --> 16:19.711
- [powers zapping]

16:19.713 --> 16:23.381
- Billy, Nora.
- Apologies, ThunderParents.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.048
They snuck here,

16:24.050 --> 16:27.418
but I promise I will not lose
one of your children again.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.954
- You're it!
[whooshes]

16:29.956 --> 16:32.557
- Spoke too soon.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.725
Chloe?

16:33.727 --> 16:35.493
Chloe!!

16:35.495 --> 16:37.662
- We know why you two
snuck out of the house

16:37.664 --> 16:38.763
and came down here.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.964
- BILLY & NORA:
You do?

16:39.966 --> 16:43.067
- You decided to come down here
and see us get the award.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.536
- To tell you the truth,
we were a little heartbroken

16:45.538 --> 16:48.473
when you guys said you
didn't wanna come tonight.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.741
- But the fact
you two showed up

16:49.743 --> 16:53.011
means more than any award
we've ever gotten--

16:53.013 --> 16:56.547
even more than
the Nobel Pizza Prize.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.685
- Thunder Man, Electress,
get backstage.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.853
We're about to start.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.956
- You know what?
Come on stage with us.

17:04.958 --> 17:08.993
- Look, Nora, those people
have moustaches drawn on them.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.830
Pause Girl is here somewhere.
We have to find her.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.899
- No, Billy, wait.

17:14.901 --> 17:15.833
We came here to
meet our hero,

17:15.835 --> 17:20.972
but our real heroes are
Mr. and Mrs. Goober over there.

17:23.109 --> 17:26.444
- I thought their last
name was Thunderman.

17:26.946 --> 17:27.945
- Let's get on stage.

17:27.947 --> 17:31.716
- [awards show jazz music]
- GUESTS: [applauding]

17:35.855 --> 17:40.124
- Welcome to
the 75th Annual Supe Awards.

17:40.126 --> 17:43.761
We begin by honoring
two living legends.

17:43.763 --> 17:47.131
I am proud to present
this year's Platinum Cape

17:47.133 --> 17:52.937
Lifetime Achievement Award
to Thunder Man and Electress!

17:52.939 --> 17:54.539
- GUESTS:
[applauding, cheering]

17:54.541 --> 17:56.674
- Here's your child.
Congrats on the award.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.044
I'm never babysitting
for you again.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.581
- He needs a nap.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.484
- HANK: Thank you.
- GUESTS: [applauding]

18:06.486 --> 18:08.486
- HANK:
[laughing]

18:08.488 --> 18:10.755
We'll make this quick.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.157
I was born in
the big city.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.760
- And I was born
in a barn.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.962
- While I was flying
over skyscrapers...

18:17.964 --> 18:19.897
- BARB:
I was jumping over...

18:19.899 --> 18:22.133
- [dramatic music]

18:22.135 --> 18:23.501
- We're running
out of time.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.902
How much longer does your
blaster take to charge?

18:24.904 --> 18:28.139
- If my math is correct, three
lemons and a surprise lime.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.507
- If that stink
bomb goes off,

18:29.509 --> 18:32.877
every supe up there is gonna
smell like an elephant's armpit.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.246
- Elephants don't have armpits.
They have legpits.

18:35.248 --> 18:38.082
- That's beside the point!

18:38.084 --> 18:41.219
I'm sorry, Max, but I'm done
letting you try to fix this.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.220
- You don't have a choice.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.622
There's nothing your
powers can do to help.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.791
- My powers won't
help, but...

18:46.793 --> 18:47.525
Dark Mayhem's will.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.527
- That wouldn't matter,
unless you took them.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.563
Oh, my gosh,
you took them!

18:52.565 --> 18:54.065
- You might wanna
stand back for this.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.200
- Phoebe, what are
you doing?

18:56.202 --> 18:58.035
- [explosion]

18:58.037 --> 19:00.805
- [puff of smoke]

19:00.807 --> 19:01.539
- Excuse me.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.942
I guess those fancy
hot dogs I had are "barking."

19:04.944 --> 19:08.513
- GUESTS:
[laughing]

19:08.815 --> 19:09.614
- MAX:
[coughing]

19:09.616 --> 19:12.216
How could you take Dark Mayhem's
powers from the orb?

19:12.218 --> 19:13.117
- Max, I had to.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.852
- I told you
it was dangerous.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.954
- Yeah, for you.
I can handle it.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.123
Besides, it's not like
your portable juice box

19:19.125 --> 19:21.759
was gonna save us.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.594
- [laser blasting]

19:23.596 --> 19:24.962
- That was surprisingly
powerful.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.965
- See? I could have
cleaned up my own mess.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.033
I didn't need your help.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.536
- Okay, well, can we focus
on the positive?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.271
Our future as
supes is saved,

19:33.273 --> 19:36.107
and it smells
lemon-tastic in here.

19:37.143 --> 19:40.211
- The only thing that could
make this moment better

19:40.213 --> 19:41.712
is if our twins,
Max and Phoebe,

19:41.714 --> 19:44.015
were here to share
it with us.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.583
- Right here, Dad!

19:45.585 --> 19:46.951
- Oh. Where'd you
two come from?

19:46.953 --> 19:49.887
- It doesn't matter.
Just wrap this up.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.891
- We will now that our whole
loving family is here.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.761
- You're the worst, Phoebe.
- Get over it, Lemon Boy.

19:56.763 --> 20:01.232
- You know, Electress and I
have done many amazing things

20:01.234 --> 20:02.266
to end up here
on this stage.

20:02.268 --> 20:06.137
- But this family, and the love
we have for one another,

20:06.139 --> 20:09.640
is our greatest
lifetime achievement.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.108
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

20:11.110 --> 20:15.680
- GUESTS:
[cheering, applauding]

20:15.682 --> 20:17.915
- [awards show jazz music]

20:17.917 --> 20:20.618
- As much as I wanted
to meet Pause Girl,

20:20.620 --> 20:21.519
this is pretty
amazing, too.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.654
- Yeah, we definitely
made the right choice.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.291
Still, it'd be pretty
cool to meet her some day.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.360
- [powers whooshing]

20:41.107 --> 20:43.708
- [magic marker squeaking]

20:45.044 --> 20:47.378
[magic marker squeaking]

20:49.048 --> 20:51.148
- [giggles]

20:53.052 --> 20:53.851
- [powers whooshing]

20:53.853 --> 20:55.720
- Yeah, who cares about--
- Billy!

20:55.722 --> 20:58.089
You have a moustache.
- So do you!

20:58.091 --> 20:59.790
- BILLY & NORA:
Pause Girl!

20:59.792 --> 21:03.027
- I'm never shaving
this off.

21:08.334 --> 21:11.836
- Hey, Max, could you, uh,
make sure nobody's watching

21:11.838 --> 21:13.104
while I put
Dark Mayhem's powers back?

21:13.106 --> 21:15.206
- Just do it yourself,
like you always do.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.241
- Oh, come on.
Don't be grumpy.

21:17.243 --> 21:18.809
- I am not grumpy.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.012
This is the face of rage.

21:21.214 --> 21:25.816
- [cell phone clicks]
- [cell phone 'bings']

21:25.818 --> 21:28.185
- And a text of rage.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.693
- [tiles beeping]

21:38.965 --> 21:41.832
- Okay.
[sighs]

21:41.834 --> 21:44.402
Bye-bye, evil powers.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.438
Uh, I said, bye-bye.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.807
Uh,<i> adiós</i> .

21:50.276 --> 21:52.209
Arrivederci.

21:55.014 --> 22:00.117
Oh, no, I can't put
Dark Mayhem's powers back.

22:00.119 --> 22:04.822
- [dramatic music]

22:11.230 --> 22:27.478
- ¶
