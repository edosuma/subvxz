WEBVTT

00:04.567 --> 00:06.533
LAST SEASON ON "I AM JAZZ."

00:06.533 --> 00:07.567
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

00:07.567 --> 00:08.933
OH, MY GOD.

00:08.933 --> 00:10.267
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

00:10.267 --> 00:12.333
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY WE DID
A PRETTY GOOD JOB

00:12.333 --> 00:13.900
FOR JAZZ'S SWEET 16.

00:13.900 --> 00:15.300
DO YOU THINK THAT
YOU'D BE INTERESTED

00:15.300 --> 00:16.667
IN DATING TRANS PEOPLE MAYBE?

00:16.667 --> 00:18.067
UM, FOR SURE. YEAH.

00:18.067 --> 00:19.467
WELL, I KNOW THIS GUY SHANE.

00:19.467 --> 00:21.633
I THINK I'M JUST GOING
TO SIT DOWN, HONESTLY.

00:21.633 --> 00:23.400
I'LL SIT WITH YOU.
IT'S OKAY.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.100
DATING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A WEIRD,
AWKWARD SITUATION.

00:28.467 --> 00:29.700
THIS IS LIFE.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.300
LIKE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.233
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO WORK ON.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.467
I'M ON THE SEARCH FOR AMERICA'S
NEXT TOP VAGINA.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.633
OH, MY GOD.

00:37.633 --> 00:40.033
IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT
TO DO THE TYPE

00:40.033 --> 00:42.133
OF VAGINOPLASTY THAT YOU WANT.

00:42.133 --> 00:44.800
I WOULD RECOMMEND
A COLON VAGINOPLASTY,

00:44.800 --> 00:47.733
WHICH USES YOUR INTESTINE
FOR THE VAGINAL CONDUIT.

00:47.733 --> 00:50.200
I WOULD LIKE TO DO
THE SURGERY IN TWO PARTS.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.233
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE ALL
THE PIECES TO THE PUZZLE YET?

00:52.233 --> 00:53.933
IT DOESN'T FEEL PERFECT YET.

00:53.933 --> 00:57.600
TO CREATE AN ADEQUATE VAGINA
IN TERMS OF DEPTH AND DIAMETER,

00:57.600 --> 01:00.667
MY SUGGESTION WOULD PROBABLY BE
TO USE THE PENILE INVERSION

01:00.667 --> 01:03.167
PLUS THE SKIN GRAFT
FROM THE LOWER ABDOMEN.

01:03.167 --> 01:07.433
YAY! NO COLONS, NO INTESTINES,
JUST THE STANDARD VAGINOPLASTY.

01:07.433 --> 01:10.367
NOW, LET'S MAKE STEPS
TOWARDS GETTING A DATE

01:10.367 --> 01:13.367
AND GETTING IT DONE.

01:13.367 --> 01:14.800
Jazz:
THIS SEASON ON "I AM JAZZ."

01:14.800 --> 01:16.200
COME ON, JAZZ.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.733
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL IT.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.867
IT'S A NEW JAZZ.
IT'S A NEW WORLD FOR US.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.633
SHE'S INDEPENDENT.

01:21.633 --> 01:25.567
I HAPPENED TO MEET A GIRL WHO
I THINK YOU WOULD REALLY LIKE.

01:25.567 --> 01:26.833
WAIT, A GIRL?

01:26.833 --> 01:29.133
THIS IS A GOOD TIME
TO EXPERIMENT WITH MY SEXUALITY.

01:29.133 --> 01:31.067
-OH!

01:31.067 --> 01:34.600
THE MORE I GET TO KNOW HER,
THE MORE I AM ATTRACTED TO HER.

01:34.600 --> 01:38.100
IS THIS A SOUL MATE
OR A SEXUAL MATE?

01:38.100 --> 01:39.700
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
A BEACHED WHALE.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.800
Man: JAZZ DOESN'T HAVE

01:40.800 --> 01:42.500
THE HEALTHIEST
RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.967
IN OTHER WORDS,
SHE'S TOO FAT.

01:43.967 --> 01:46.667
MY EATING HABITS
ARE BEYOND MY CONTROL.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.100
LET'S GO.
PUSH YOURSELF.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.867
YEAH.

01:49.867 --> 01:51.433
SO BAD NEWS FIRST.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.467
I FEEL LIKE MARCI OVERPROMISED

01:53.467 --> 01:56.200
WHAT SHE SAID SHE COULD DO
FOR ME SURGICALLY.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.867
WE CAN PUT IN A TISSUE
EXPANDER IN THE SCROTUM,

01:58.867 --> 02:00.667
AND YOU SLOWLY FILL IT UP.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.933
WE'RE TALKING, LIKE,
THE SIZE OF A GRAPEFRUIT.

02:03.933 --> 02:06.133
NO.
NO.

02:06.133 --> 02:08.433
Man: RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE NO
EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE,

02:08.433 --> 02:09.900
IN FACT, BORN THIS WAY.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.767
WE LOVE OURSELVES.
WE EMBRACE WHO WE ARE.

02:11.767 --> 02:12.867
YOU DON'T LIKE WHO YOU ARE.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.067
WISH THAT YOU COULD
EMBRACE THIS TOO.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.067
YOU WERE BORN A CERTAIN WAY,
AND YOU DON'T LOVE

02:15.067 --> 02:16.167
HOW YOU WERE BORN, APPARENTLY.

02:16.167 --> 02:17.500
DON'T TELL ME IF I DON'T
LOVE MYSELF

02:17.500 --> 02:19.900
BECAUSE I KNOW
WHO I LOVE, NOT YOU.

02:19.900 --> 02:23.633
HURRICANE IRMA IS A MONSTER
CATEGORY 5 STORM.

02:23.633 --> 02:26.567
-I'M FREAKING OUT.
-THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL STORM

02:26.567 --> 02:29.067
EVER RECORDED
IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.

02:29.067 --> 02:32.100
Jazz: MY ENTIRE FAMILY IS RIGHT
IN THE PATH OF IT.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.967

02:45.800 --> 02:48.400
Jazz: SINCE LAST YEAR,
THERE HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN

02:48.400 --> 02:50.733
A LOT OF NEW CHANGES IN MY LIFE.

02:50.733 --> 02:54.900
**

02:54.900 --> 02:58.167
I FINALLY GOT MY LICENSE,
AND I CAN JUST GO OUT AND DRIVE

02:58.167 --> 02:59.600
WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT,

02:59.600 --> 03:01.433
AND I LIKE THE INDEPENDENCE

03:01.433 --> 03:04.167
AND THE FREEDOM
THAT IT GIVES ME.

03:04.167 --> 03:09.067
**

03:09.067 --> 03:10.933
HELLO.

03:10.933 --> 03:14.500
I'M REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE TODAY
I AM GETTING MY HAIR

03:14.500 --> 03:16.800
DYED A DIFFERENT COLOR.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.267
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING,
SO IT'S JUST SO DIFFERENT.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.433
OH, YEAH.
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT, THOUGH.

03:21.433 --> 03:23.367
HOW DO YOUR PARENTS FEEL
ABOUT YOU DOING THIS?

03:23.367 --> 03:25.100
THEY DO NOT KNOW.
UH-OH.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.567
PARTIALLY, I'M GOING
TO DYE MY HAIR

03:26.567 --> 03:28.100
JUST BECAUSE I WANT IT
TO LOOK CUTE,

03:28.100 --> 03:31.567
BUT ALSO I FEEL LIKE I'M
ENTERING A NEW STAGE OF MY LIFE.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.567
I DECIDED THAT I WANTED
THE BOTTOM SURGERY,

03:34.567 --> 03:37.067
AND AFTER LOOKING UP
COUNTLESS DIFFERENT SURGEONS,

03:37.067 --> 03:38.533
I CHOSE MARCI BOWERS

03:38.533 --> 03:41.900
BECAUSE SHE JUST PROVIDED
THE BEST OPTION POSSIBLE.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.900
THIS YEAR, MY BIGGEST PRIORITY

03:43.900 --> 03:46.633
IS REALLY JUST TO SET
A DATE FOR THE SURGERY,

03:46.633 --> 03:50.133
GET THIS OPERATION DONE
AND CONTINUE GROWING UP.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.633
WHAT MADE YOU DO THIS?

03:51.633 --> 03:56.667
I'M JUST READY FOR A CHANGE KIND
OF REFLECTING MY PERSONALITY.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.900
I FEEL LIKE I'M DEFINITELY
EVOLVING AS A PERSON.

03:59.900 --> 04:03.367
LAST YEAR, I FEEL LIKE
I WAS GOING ON PLAYDATES,

04:03.367 --> 04:06.100
AND NOW I WANT TO EXPLORE
GOING ON REAL DATES.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.267
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON OVER HERE, JAZZ.

04:08.267 --> 04:11.067
IN THE PAST, I ALSO DIDN'T
LIKE SOCIALIZING THAT MUCH,

04:11.067 --> 04:13.700
BUT I'M TRYING
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS

04:13.700 --> 04:15.933
AND REALLY ENGAGE IN LIFE.

04:15.933 --> 04:19.433
OVERALL, I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M IN
A GOOD PLACE IN MY LIFE.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.633
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:21.633 --> 04:23.433
I LOVE IT, HONESTLY.
YOU LOVE IT?

04:23.433 --> 04:24.967
MY GOAL WAS TO LOOK
LIKE A MERMAID,

04:24.967 --> 04:26.867
AND I FEEL LIKE A MERMAID.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.433
YAY.
BEAUTIFUL.

04:28.433 --> 04:29.900
IT'S, LIKE,
EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.067
GOOD.

04:31.067 --> 04:39.333
**

04:39.333 --> 04:41.133
OOH.
THIS CANDLE SMELLS SO GOOD.

04:41.133 --> 04:43.733
WHAT DOES IT SMELL LIKE?

04:43.733 --> 04:44.867
LIKE LEMON.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.900
IS THIS A CARD
FOR YOUR MOM'S BIRTHDAY?

04:46.900 --> 04:48.933
YEP.
IT'S BLANK.

04:48.933 --> 04:51.067
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE FIRST TO SIGN IT.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.867
MY MOM'S BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP,

04:52.867 --> 04:55.967
AND IT'S JUST A GOOD TIME
FOR THE FAMILY TO GET TOGETHER.

04:55.967 --> 04:59.533
SANDER AND GRIFFEN ARE BACK
ON HER BIRTHDAY, SO I LOVE IT.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.700
IT'S NO SECRET THAT
I AM SUFFERING

05:01.700 --> 05:03.200
THROUGH PARTIAL EMPTY NEST,

05:03.200 --> 05:07.200
AND I STILL CRY WHEN I GO
BY THEIR BEDROOMS.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.800
SO ANY TIME THE TWINS COME HOME
MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.900
Greg: ARI COULDN'T MAKE IT,
BUT SHE'S DOING GREAT.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.967
SHE'S IN HER SENIOR YEAR,
SO WE'RE EXCITED FOR HER.

05:14.967 --> 05:16.733
SHE'S MATURED QUITE A BIT.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.067
LIKE, THE OTHER KIDS ARE STILL
IN THAT TEENAGE PHASE

05:19.067 --> 05:21.233
WHERE I SPEAK
AND THEY DON'T HEAR ME,

05:21.233 --> 05:23.433
AND SHE'LL BE LIKE,
"KIDS, YOU'RE IGNORING MOM."

05:23.433 --> 05:26.133
I'M LIKE, "WHOA, SOMEBODY IS
STICKING UP FOR ME.

05:26.133 --> 05:27.433
THIS IS GREAT."

05:27.433 --> 05:29.267
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON
FOR YOUR MOM'S BIRTHDAY?

05:29.267 --> 05:30.633
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO GO
TO THIS RESTAURANT

05:30.633 --> 05:34.900
THAT I KNOW SHE LIKES A LOT
AND THEN THE BIG SURPRISE.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.267
WHAT'S THAT?
MY BROTHER AND HIS FIANCEE

05:37.267 --> 05:39.900
ARE COMING IN FROM OHIO
TO SURPRISE HER.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.533
OH, OKAY.
YEAH.

05:41.533 --> 05:43.967
IS YOUR BROTHER MEETING US
THERE, OR IS HE COMING HERE?

05:43.967 --> 05:45.067
HE'S GOING TO
MEET US THERE.

05:45.067 --> 05:47.333
OKAY.
BUT WE'RE ALL GOING TOGETHER,

05:47.333 --> 05:48.933
ME, YOU, GRIFFEN,
SANDER, AND JAZZ?

05:48.933 --> 05:50.333
YEAH, MM-HMM,
OUR FAMILY IS GOING.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.433
WHERE IS JAZZ?

05:51.433 --> 05:53.233
I DON'T KNOW.

05:53.233 --> 05:56.133
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HER CAR IS NOT HERE.

05:56.133 --> 05:58.767
THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT
I'VE SEEN FROM JAZZ IS THAT NOW

05:58.767 --> 06:02.533
THAT SHE HAS HER DRIVER'S
LICENSE, SHE'S INDEPENDENT.

06:02.533 --> 06:03.900
SHE DIDN'T SAY,
"HEY, I'M LEAVING."

06:03.900 --> 06:05.900
NO, SHE JUST LEAVES.
"CAN I GO"

06:05.900 --> 06:07.067
I TOLD HER NOT
TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.967
SHE JUST GETS UP AND GOES.

06:08.967 --> 06:11.667
IT'S SO WEIRD BECAUSE I'M LIKE,
"JAZZ, JAZZ, COME HERE.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.367
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU."
GONE.

06:13.367 --> 06:14.967
SO IT'S A NEW JAZZ.

06:14.967 --> 06:16.500
IT'S A NEW WORLD FOR US.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.267
I'VE GOT TO GET
THE CAKE ALL SET.

06:18.267 --> 06:19.867
ICE CREAM CAKE?
DUH.

06:19.867 --> 06:21.833
MY MOTHER ONLY LIKES
ICE CREAM CAKES.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.467
ARE YOU GOING TO PUT
THE NUMBER ON THE CAKE,

06:23.467 --> 06:24.633
OR ARE YOU GOING TO...

06:24.633 --> 06:29.200
HOW AM I GOING TO PUT
77 CANDLES ON THE CAKE?

06:29.200 --> 06:33.067
HELLO.
HELLO.

06:33.067 --> 06:36.167
SURPRISE.

06:36.167 --> 06:38.667
HOLY CRAP.

06:38.667 --> 06:43.300
I KIND OF HAVE LEARNED TO JUST
EMBRACE HER UNIQUENESS.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.600
ARE YOU GOING TO
MAINTAIN IT THOUGH?

06:44.600 --> 06:47.733
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT, LIKE,
INTO THAT KIND OF STUFF?

06:47.733 --> 06:52.267
YOU KNOW WHAT? I FORGOT TO BUY
COLOR-MAINTAINING SHAMPOO.

06:52.267 --> 06:53.433
DADDY HAS SOME.
I THINK I HAVE SOME.

06:53.433 --> 06:55.833
DADDY HAS SOME FOR
WHEN HE DYES HIS HAIR.

06:55.833 --> 07:03.667
**

07:03.667 --> 07:07.100
SANDER, GRIFFEN, CAN YOU GUYS
HELP ME OUT WITH SOMETHING?

07:07.100 --> 07:08.500
WELL, I SEE A HAMMOCK
RIGHT HERE.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.600
YEAH, I NEED HELP
WITH THE HAMMOCK.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.900
I SEE A REALLY,
REALLY TRASHY HAMMOCK.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.267
THAT THING IS IN BAD SHAPE.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.067
SANDER AND I ARE NOW
IN OUR FALL SEMESTER

07:16.067 --> 07:19.133
OF SOPHOMORE YEAR,
AND IT'S CRAZY.

07:19.133 --> 07:20.433
WE'RE LIVING IN A FRAT HOUSE.

07:20.433 --> 07:24.400
THE FRAT HOUSE HAS
VERY MINIMAL RULES.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.267
IT'S A RAMBUNCTIOUS CROWD.

07:26.267 --> 07:28.100
VERY RAMBUNCTIOUS CROWD.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.300
THE BOYS ARE MUCH DIFFERENT NOW
THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN COLLEGE.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.500
THEY LIVE IN THEIR
FRATERNITY HOUSE,

07:35.500 --> 07:38.100
WHICH HAS ADDED A NEW DYNAMIC.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.433
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT AS MUCH.

07:39.433 --> 07:40.633
YOU'RE COMING IN AWFULLY LATE.

07:40.633 --> 07:42.800
YOU GUYS COME IN AT,
LIKE, 2 IN THE MORNING.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.367
YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES.

07:44.367 --> 07:49.200
LET'S JUST SAY THAT A YEAR
OF COLLEGE CHANGES A PERSON.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.700
THEY CAME BACK WITH QUITE
A DIFFERENT VIEW

07:51.700 --> 07:55.067
ON WHAT IT IS TO BE SOCIAL,
HOW TO ENJOY LIFE,

07:55.067 --> 08:00.400
AND WE'RE TACKLING
THAT ISSUE AT THE MOMENT.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.267
CAN YOU LET ME FINISH TYING IT?

08:02.267 --> 08:05.067
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.833
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU
NEED US TO HELP YOU WITH?

08:06.833 --> 08:08.567
NO.
THANKS, GUYS.

08:08.567 --> 08:09.800
HAVE A GOOD NAP.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.700
I THINK I JUST WANT TO TEST
OUT THIS HAMMOCK.

08:21.767 --> 08:26.267
JAZZ SPENDS A LOT OF HER TIME
IN HER ROOM BINGE-WATCHING TV,

08:26.267 --> 08:27.567
EATING WHATEVER SHE WANTS --

08:27.567 --> 08:30.500
AND HAS BEEN GAINING WEIGHT
AS A RESULT.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.933
Jazz: I'M A VERY,
VERY HUNGRY GIRL.

08:32.933 --> 08:34.633
ANYWHERE THERE'S
A BUNCH OF FOOD,

08:34.633 --> 08:37.100
I'M GOING TO PIG OUT,
AND IT'S THE BEST THING EVER.

08:41.833 --> 08:42.933
HELLO?

08:42.933 --> 08:45.733
HI, JEANETTE, HOW ARE YOU?

08:45.733 --> 08:47.200
I'M GREAT NOW.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.800
SINCE JAZZ DECIDED
TO GO WITH DR. BOWERS,

08:49.800 --> 08:51.300
WE'VE CONNECTED A FEW TIMES,

08:51.300 --> 08:53.533
AND WE'RE WORKING ON
GETTING A SET DATE

08:53.533 --> 08:55.167
TO HAVE THE BOTTOM SURGERY.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.567
JAZZ.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.967
WHAT?
LOOK WHO I HAVE.

08:58.967 --> 09:00.133
IS THAT MARCI?

09:00.133 --> 09:01.433
HEY, IT'S ME JAZZ.
WHAT'S UP?

09:01.433 --> 09:02.833
HOW ARE YOU?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.767
GUESS WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO TALK ABOUT?

09:04.767 --> 09:06.267
VAGINAS.

09:06.267 --> 09:09.933
WE OBVIOUSLY WANT THIS TO
REALLY BE THE BEST SURGERY

09:09.933 --> 09:11.300
IT COULD POSSIBLY BE.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.567
MM-HMM.

09:12.567 --> 09:15.333
I'VE BEEN CONSIDERING
A NUMBER OF IDEAS

09:15.333 --> 09:17.433
THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL,
AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO

09:17.433 --> 09:20.167
IS JUST HAVE YOU
COME SEE ME AGAIN,

09:20.167 --> 09:23.933
IF IT'S POSSIBLE, WHERE WE CAN
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THIS.

09:23.933 --> 09:26.333
Jazz: I'M VERY SURPRISED
THAT DR. BOWERS SAYS

09:26.333 --> 09:28.600
THAT SHE HAS NEW IDEAS

09:28.600 --> 09:30.300
BECAUSE WHEN I WENT
ON THE CONSULTATION

09:30.300 --> 09:31.900
WITH HER A YEAR AGO,

09:31.900 --> 09:35.300
SHE WANTED TO DO THE STANDARD
VAGINOPLASTY IN ONE STEP,

09:35.300 --> 09:37.367
AND SHE WAS REALLY
CONFIDENT ABOUT IT.

09:37.367 --> 09:39.200
I JUST WANT TO GET
THESE THINGS ON THE RADAR

09:39.200 --> 09:41.067
SO THAT WE HAVE
EVERYTHING IN ORDER FOR

09:41.067 --> 09:43.300
WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE
A SURGICAL DATE.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.533
WE'RE ALL ABOUT THAT.

09:44.533 --> 09:46.633
I AM TOTALLY SHOCKED THAT
WE HAVE TO GO OUT

09:46.633 --> 09:48.333
TO CALIFORNIA AGAIN
TO SEE DR. BOWERS.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.733
IT MUST BE REALLY IMPORTANT.

09:49.733 --> 09:52.067
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU
IN PERSON, OKAY?

09:52.067 --> 09:54.267
All: BYE.

09:54.267 --> 09:56.333
FOR US TO GO ALL THE WAY
OUT TO CALIFORNIA IS NOT,

09:56.333 --> 09:58.600
TIME-WISE, PRACTICAL RIGHT NOW,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:58.600 --> 10:01.033
I WILL GO TO THE ENDS OF THE
EARTH TO DO WHAT I NEED FOR JAZZ

10:01.033 --> 10:03.967
TO HAVE HER SURGERY
DONE THE RIGHT WAY.

10:03.967 --> 10:05.333
AW, THE CHIP BROKE.

10:05.333 --> 10:06.733
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

10:06.733 --> 10:08.933
WHAT?
I'M EATING.

10:08.933 --> 10:13.833
BUFFALO CHICKEN DIP SHOULD NOT
BE IN A CROCK-POT ON JAZZ'S BED.

10:13.833 --> 10:16.100
IT'S JUST... THAT IS UNHEALTHY.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.500
LET'S JUST CLEAR IT OUT.
GIVE ME THAT.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.833
I'M GETTING ALL THE JUNK FOOD
OUT OF HERE.

10:18.833 --> 10:19.867
NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:19.867 --> 10:22.433
I'M TAKING THIS.

10:22.433 --> 10:23.533
OKAY.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.600
I SEE WRAPPERS OVER HERE.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.533
WHERE?
IN HERE.

10:29.533 --> 10:31.600
OH, MY GOD.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.167
JAZZ, WHAT IS THIS?

10:34.167 --> 10:36.000
THIS IS ALL, LIKE, TAKEOUT FOOD.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.467
DAD THINKS I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH
TO HAVE THIS BOTTOM SURGERY.

10:43.467 --> 10:45.333
Greg: I'VE BEEN SEEING
CERTAIN THINGS

10:45.333 --> 10:46.700
THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

10:46.700 --> 10:50.467
HURRICANE IRMA IS A MONSTER
CATEGORY 5 STORM.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.033
IT COULD SCOUR MIAMI BEACH.

10:52.033 --> 10:54.800
THE EYE COULD POTENTIALLY
GO OVER OUR HOUSE

10:54.800 --> 10:57.067
AND DESTROY EVERYTHING.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.633
IS THIS FOOD THAT'S BEEN EATEN,
JUST, LIKE, GARBAGE,

11:02.633 --> 11:04.433
OR IS IT FOOD THAT
YOU'RE STILL EATING?

11:06.533 --> 11:08.667
THIS IS DISGUSTING, JAZZ.

11:08.667 --> 11:09.900
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
DOING THIS FOR?

11:09.900 --> 11:11.733
BECAUSE I KNOW IT COULDN'T
BE THAT LONG.

11:11.733 --> 11:13.100
IT WOULD'VE STARTED
TO SMELL OR SOMETHING.

11:13.100 --> 11:17.067
IT'S BEEN, LIKE, MAYBE,
LIKE, 2 OR 3 MONTHS.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.500
TWO OR 3 MONTHS?

11:18.500 --> 11:21.800
EVER SINCE I STARTED DRIVING
AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT,

11:21.800 --> 11:24.767
WHERE I CAN ORDER
THE FOOD FROM ANYWHERE.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.267
Jeanette: YOU KNOW, I KNEW THAT
JAZZ HAD BEEN DOING

11:27.267 --> 11:28.900
SOME BAD EATING HERE
AND THERE,

11:28.900 --> 11:30.200
BUT WHEN I FIND THE DEGREE

11:30.200 --> 11:32.967
TO WHICH SHE HAS GONE
TO OBTAIN THE FOOD

11:32.967 --> 11:34.800
AND HIDE THE FOOD,
IT'S LIKE A HOARDER.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.700
IT'S LIKE GARBAGE HOARDER.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.800
I'M SPEECHLESS.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.467
I REALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

11:39.467 --> 11:41.300
IF I LOOK AT MY BODY
IN THE MIRROR,

11:41.300 --> 11:43.567
I COULD CLEARLY SEE
THAT I'VE GAINED WEIGHT,

11:43.567 --> 11:45.767
AND I'M NOT REALLY
HAPPY WITH THAT IMAGE.

11:45.767 --> 11:48.433
HOWEVER, I JUST
LOVE FOOD SO MUCH.

11:48.433 --> 11:53.067
IT MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE
AND SAFE AND HAPPY.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.900
ANY IDEAS ON WHAT
WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU?

11:55.900 --> 11:57.467
DO WE GO TO A THERAPIST?

11:57.467 --> 11:58.900
NO.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.733
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU,
AND I WANT YOU NOT TO DO THIS.

12:01.733 --> 12:03.133
I'M NIPPING THIS IN THE BUD.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.467
WE'RE GOING TO DO LIKE WE DID
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

12:04.467 --> 12:06.700
AND DO THE HEALTH-FOOD KICK.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.800
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S
JUST SUPER HUNGRY

12:08.800 --> 12:10.600
OR IF THERE'S EMOTIONAL
EATING BEHIND IT.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.567
MAYBE IT'S A COMBINATION
OF BOTH.

12:12.567 --> 12:15.467
ON TOP OF THAT, SHE'S NOT
SUPER DISCIPLINED

12:15.467 --> 12:17.733
ABOUT WORKING OUT,
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.

12:17.733 --> 12:19.733
I THINK THAT'S A SIGN
OF MATURITY.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.533
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU
FEEL REALLY BAD,

12:21.533 --> 12:24.167
BUT THIS HAS GOT
TO STOP, OKAY?

12:24.167 --> 12:26.900
ALL RIGHT. BYE.
NO MORE JUNK FOOD FOR YOU.

12:28.733 --> 12:35.467
**

12:35.467 --> 12:36.933
THIS LOOKS REALLY NICE.

12:36.933 --> 12:39.200
WATCH HOW DAD OPENS
THE DOOR FOR ME.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.800
AW.
WHAT A GENTLEMAN.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.467
HELLO.
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

12:42.467 --> 12:44.067
WE'RE AT THE LEBANESE
RESTAURANT TONIGHT

12:44.067 --> 12:46.467
BECAUSE IT'S JACKY'S
77th BIRTHDAY,

12:46.467 --> 12:48.067
77 YEARS YOUNG,

12:48.067 --> 12:50.200
AND SHE'S ACCEPTED
AND EMBRACED THE FACT

12:50.200 --> 12:51.700
THAT SHE'S A SENIOR CITIZEN.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.067
SHE DOESN'T, LIKE,
"OH, I'M SO OLD. I DON'T..."

12:54.067 --> 12:56.567
NO, YOU WON'T
HEAR THAT FROM HER.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.167
HELLO. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

13:00.167 --> 13:01.967
GOOD.
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

13:01.967 --> 13:03.900
I'M HERE. YOU DIDN'T START
EATING WITHOUT US.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.567
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.300
I HAVE AN EXPRESSION THAT
THE KIDS HAVE GROWN UP,

13:08.300 --> 13:09.700
AND WE'VE GROWN OLDER.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.200
KEEP THE "WE" OUT OF IT.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.833
YOU FEEL YOU'RE GROWING OLDER.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.267
OH, EVERY DAY THAT I WAKE UP
AND I'M UPRIGHT,

13:15.267 --> 13:19.067
I'M THRILLED.

13:19.067 --> 13:21.067
WHO'S THAT?

13:21.067 --> 13:22.700
HOLY MOLY.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.200
SURPRISE.
I WONDERED.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.233
WHAT A SURPRISE THIS IS!

13:26.233 --> 13:29.500
Jacky: WE SEE JONATHAN AND HIS
FIANCEE VERY INFREQUENTLY.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.833
HE'S SO FAR AWAY,
SO THIS WAS TRULY A TREAT.

13:32.833 --> 13:36.233
THIS IS PROBABLY AS SURPRISED
AS YOU'RE EVER GOING TO SEE ME.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.367
BEFORE WE CAME IN, I SAID MOM
IS GOING TO GO LIKE THIS.

13:38.367 --> 13:40.100
THAT'S THE FACE SHE WAS.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.300
MY BETTER LOOK?

13:41.300 --> 13:44.367
SHE'S GOING TO DO
THE EDITH BUNKER, I SAID.

13:44.367 --> 13:46.600
Jeanette: I REALLY ENJOY HAVING
EVERYBODY TOGETHER,

13:46.600 --> 13:47.933
AS MANY OF US AS POSSIBLE,

13:47.933 --> 13:50.667
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL VERY BUSY
IN OUR OWN LITTLE LIVES

13:50.667 --> 13:51.900
AND DOING OUR THING,

13:51.900 --> 13:53.833
AND WE SHOULD HAVE MORE
TIMES WITH EACH OTHER.

13:53.833 --> 13:58.500
YOU KNOW, I WOULD RATHER BE WITH
MY FAMILY THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

13:58.500 --> 14:02.200
JAZZ, I'M JUST CURIOUS, IN TERMS
OF TRANSITION AND SURGERY,

14:02.200 --> 14:03.600
HOW THINGS ARE GOING.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.067
BASICALLY, THE LAST THING
I DID RECENTLY WAS FIGURE OUT

14:07.067 --> 14:09.467
THAT I'M GOING TO GO
TO DR. MARCI BOWERS

14:09.467 --> 14:12.233
FOR MY BOTTOM SURGERY.

14:12.233 --> 14:13.633
WHEN ARE YOU THINKING
OF DOING THAT?

14:13.633 --> 14:16.133
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING THE SURGERY, LIKE,

14:16.133 --> 14:18.200
A LITTLE BIT LESS
THAN A YEAR FROM NOW,

14:18.200 --> 14:19.433
AND THEN I TOLD DAD THAT,

14:19.433 --> 14:21.567
AND NOW HE THINKS
I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH

14:21.567 --> 14:23.467
TO HAVE THIS BOTTOM SURGERY.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.367
DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT?

14:25.367 --> 14:26.600
NOPE.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.567
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING EVERYTHING
IN FULL CONTEXT,

14:28.567 --> 14:29.700
SO I'M NOT GOING
TO GO THERE.

14:29.700 --> 14:30.867
HE DOESN'T THINK
I'M MATURE ENOUGH.

14:30.867 --> 14:32.167
I'M GOING TO BE AN 80-YEAR-OLD,

14:32.167 --> 14:35.133
AND THEN I'LL HAVE
THE PERFECT VAGINA.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.133
LAST YEAR, WE WENT ON
A LOT OF CONSULTATIONS,

14:37.133 --> 14:39.233
AND WE TALKED ABOUT
THE TIMING OF IT.

14:39.233 --> 14:41.333
I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE
THE SURGERY SHOULD BE DONE

14:41.333 --> 14:43.767
AFTER YOU FINISH HIGH SCHOOL,
WHICH IS WHEN YOU'RE 18.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.067
BUT THEN SHE'LL BE IN COLLEGE.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.067
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

14:46.067 --> 14:47.933
LIKE, KIDS ARE DOING IT
AT, LIKE, 16.

14:47.933 --> 14:51.500
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY SET
AN ACTUAL DATE,

14:51.500 --> 14:55.533
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER IN A BIT
MORE CONTROL OF HER LIFE.

14:55.533 --> 14:58.667
I'VE BEEN SEEING CERTAIN THINGS
THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.267
I FEEL LIKE, ULTIMATELY,
IT'S MY OWN DECISION,

15:01.267 --> 15:03.433
AND I'M GOING TO CHOOSE
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

15:03.433 --> 15:04.833
I'M NOT GOING TO DO
THIS PROCEDURE

15:04.833 --> 15:07.733
IN THE MIDDLE OF COLLEGE
BECAUSE THEN I'LL BE DILATING,

15:07.733 --> 15:11.400
WHICH IS, LIKE, A RECOVERY
PROCESS, INSIDE A COLLEGE DORM,

15:11.400 --> 15:13.167
AND THAT'S NOT PREFERABLE.

15:13.167 --> 15:16.600
WHILE I DEFINITELY LOVE
MY DAD'S FEEDBACK AND ADVICE,

15:16.600 --> 15:18.300
I FEEL LIKE BEING AT HOME

15:18.300 --> 15:20.500
SO I CAN RECOVER
WITH MY MOM BY MY SIDE

15:20.500 --> 15:22.167
IS SOMETHING REALLY VITAL,

15:22.167 --> 15:24.267
AND IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I WANT TO DO.

15:24.267 --> 15:26.267
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
IS THIS FAMILY,

15:26.267 --> 15:27.733
THE SUPPORT THAT
THEY'RE PROVIDING YOU,

15:27.733 --> 15:28.933
THAT'S THE BIG DEAL,

15:28.933 --> 15:30.500
AND WHO YOU ARE
IS WHO YOU ARE.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.767
WE'RE ALL THERE FOR YOU.
THAT'S A GIVEN.

15:32.767 --> 15:34.667
AS I THINK ABOUT JAZZ
FROM THE TIME

15:34.667 --> 15:38.067
THAT SHE WAS BARELY WALKING
TO WHO SHE'S BECOME TODAY,

15:38.067 --> 15:39.867
IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL
ROLLER-COASTER,

15:39.867 --> 15:41.633
BUT WHAT I SEE NOW FROM JAZZ

15:41.633 --> 15:44.100
AND WHAT I SEE FROM MY FAMILY
I'M VERY PROUD OF.

15:44.100 --> 15:49.533
**

15:49.533 --> 15:54.967
**

15:54.967 --> 15:56.700
GET UP, GET UP.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.700
IT WAS FUN TO DANCE
WITH THE BELLY DANCER.

16:01.700 --> 16:03.533
Jack:
SHE THINKS I HAVE NO RHYTHM,

16:03.533 --> 16:05.067
AND I THINK SHE HAS NO RHYTHM,

16:05.067 --> 16:08.067
SO TOGETHER WE ARE ARRHYTHMIC.

16:08.067 --> 16:13.333
HOW DID WE CREATE JEANETTE
ON THE ARRHYTHMIC METHOD?

16:13.333 --> 16:14.933
THINK ABOUT THAT ONE.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.500
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY DEAR.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.900
OH, MY LORD.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

16:20.900 --> 16:24.100
THIS WAS A GREAT, FUN TIME,

16:24.100 --> 16:26.200
AND THAT'S A NICE WAY
TO GET THROUGH A BIRTHDAY

16:26.200 --> 16:29.167
THAT YOU COUNT BUT DON'T COUNT.

16:29.167 --> 16:31.067
I'M USUALLY NOT AT A LOSS
FOR WORDS,

16:31.067 --> 16:33.167
BUT I HAVE TO SAY TONIGHT I AM.

16:33.167 --> 16:34.333
I LOVE YOU ALL DEARLY.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.167
THIS IS SO SPECIAL.

16:36.167 --> 16:39.700
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.567
HELLO.
HEY.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.133
SKYLAR ALREADY GOT
THE BOTTOM SURGERY.

16:46.133 --> 16:48.333
WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO PEE
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

16:50.867 --> 16:57.133
**

16:57.133 --> 16:59.233
I WONDER WHAT SKYLAR IS GOING
TO SAY ABOUT MY HAIR.

16:59.233 --> 17:00.533
I WONDER WHAT SKYLAR
IS GOING TO SAY

17:00.533 --> 17:02.867
ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN
GOING ON IN HER LIFE.

17:02.867 --> 17:05.167
OH, I KNOW.
I'M EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

17:05.167 --> 17:10.100
SKYLAR IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO
ALSO HAPPENS TO BE TRANSGENDER.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.200
THEY'RE HERE.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.367
WE'VE BEEN CLOSE
FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.300
OH, MY GOD, YOUR HAIR.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.167
AND SHE'S ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR ME.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.567
-HELLO.
-HEY. LOOK AT YOU.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.167
YOU'RE, LIKE, THE BLONDE.

17:21.167 --> 17:22.567
OH, MY GOD.

17:22.567 --> 17:25.300
SKYLAR ALREADY GOT
THE BOTTOM SURGERY.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.267
-SHE REALLY SHOULD MODEL.
-YEAH, YOU SHOULD.

17:27.267 --> 17:31.400
SHE'S STILL THE SAME SKYLAR, BUT
SHE JUST SEEMS TO BE MORE LIFTED

17:31.400 --> 17:33.333
BY BEING COMFORTABLE
IN HER BODY.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.267
DO YOU WANT TO, LIKE, GET FOOD,
OR SOMETHING BECAUSE...

17:35.267 --> 17:37.800
OH, MY GOD.
I'M STARVING.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.167
I'M HONESTLY SO EAGER
TO TALK TO SKYLAR.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.500
YOU READY FOR ME TO DRIVE?

17:41.500 --> 17:43.400
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE READY.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.100
I'M GOING TO BE
INTERROGATING THIS GIRL,

17:45.100 --> 17:46.567
ASKING HER HOW HER SURGERY WENT,

17:46.567 --> 17:48.533
WHAT HAPPENED,
WHAT WAS EVERYTHING LIKE.

17:48.533 --> 17:51.300
I JUST WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.633
PLEASE DON'T KILL US.

17:53.633 --> 17:58.367
SO YOU LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT,
YOU SKINNY BITCH.

17:58.367 --> 18:01.400
I LOST, LIKE, I'D SAY, LIKE,
10 OR 12 POUNDS.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.700
HOPEFULLY I'LL LOSE WEIGHT
WHEN I GET MY SURGERY

18:04.700 --> 18:08.067
BECAUSE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
I'M A LITTLE PUDGY.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.133
I'M SO HUNGRY RIGHT NOW.

18:09.133 --> 18:11.633
I HAVEN'T EATEN
ANYTHING ALL DAY.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.800
ANYTHING?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.633
NOTHING, BUT EVEN
IF I DID EAT SOMETHING,

18:14.633 --> 18:15.900
I WOULD STILL BE HUNGRY.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.700
I LITERALLY HAVE A PROBLEM.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.167
SOMETIMES, I JUST EAT A LOT,
EVEN IF I'M FULL.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.767
IT'S LIKE MY MIND
IS STILL HUNGRY.

18:23.767 --> 18:25.100
THE WORST PART
IS SOMETIMES, LIKE,

18:25.100 --> 18:26.800
I JUST DON'T EVEN
CARE THAT I'M FAT

18:26.800 --> 18:28.933
BECAUSE I LOOK AT IT AS,
MY BODY, AS JUST, LIKE,

18:28.933 --> 18:30.267
A VEHICLE,

18:30.267 --> 18:33.867
RATHER THAN, LIKE,
WHO I AM, BECAUSE...

18:33.867 --> 18:35.733
YOU DON'T SEE IT AS YOU.

18:35.733 --> 18:37.767
I WISH JAZZ WAS MORE
SELF-CONFIDENT

18:37.767 --> 18:39.100
BECAUSE SHE SEEMED LIKE

18:39.100 --> 18:41.467
SHE WASN'T COMPLETELY
THERE WITH HERSELF.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.633
WHEN IT COMES TO DYSPHORIA,
I'M HOPING THAT THE SURGERY

18:43.633 --> 18:45.933
WILL HELP THAT MIND
AND BODY CONNECT.

18:45.933 --> 18:49.200
BUT I STILL NEED TO KEEP MY BODY
HEALTHY SO I CAN LIVE LONGER.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.067
I WANT IT TO BE
A HEALTHY VEHICLE.

18:51.067 --> 18:57.233
THINK OF IT AS A PRODUCE TRUCK
RATHER THAN AN ICE CREAM TRUCK.

18:57.233 --> 19:01.333
THAT WAS SO CORNY.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.967
DO NOT ENTER.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.333
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.967
ARE YOU DOING A CHARBURGER TOO?

19:06.967 --> 19:08.733
I'LL GET THE CHARBUSTER,
THE BIGGER ONE.

19:08.733 --> 19:09.800
OKAY.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.167
I DEFINITELY THINK THAT
MY EATING HABITS

19:12.167 --> 19:15.333
ARE A REAL PROBLEM.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.900
MY GRANDPA IS, LIKE,
EVERY TIME HE SEES ME

19:16.900 --> 19:19.067
EATING UNHEALTHY, HE'S LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S DOING?

19:19.067 --> 19:21.367
THE PLAQUE IS BUILDING UP
IN YOUR ARTERIES,

19:21.367 --> 19:25.867
AND YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO HAVE
A STROKE OR A HEART ATTACK."

19:25.867 --> 19:29.167
LET'S EAT.

19:29.167 --> 19:32.400
I WANT TO HEAR HOW SKYLAR'S BEEN
DOING SINCE THE SURGERY.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.533
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'M IN FOR.

19:34.533 --> 19:36.233
YEAH, IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD.

19:36.233 --> 19:37.667
SHE'S DOING GREAT NOW.

19:37.667 --> 19:41.067
LIKE, THE LAST, I WOULD SAY,
LIKE, 2 WEEKS HAVE BEEN GOOD.

19:41.067 --> 19:44.100
BUT I'M GOING TO SAY,
LIKE, 3, 3 1/2

19:44.100 --> 19:47.400
TO 4 WEEKS WAS REALLY,
REALLY HARD FOR HER.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.500
FOR SO LONG, WE HAVE BEEN
PIONEERS IN THIS JOURNEY,

19:50.500 --> 19:51.767
AND IT'S HARD.

19:51.767 --> 19:54.133
I MEAN, I DON'T MIND IT,
BUT IT'S SO REFRESHING,

19:54.133 --> 19:56.433
SO NICE, TO HAVE SOMEBODY

19:56.433 --> 19:58.433
I CAN ACTUALLY ASK
THE QUESTIONS TO.

19:58.433 --> 20:01.400
SHE HAD A REACTION TO ANY KIND
OF TOPICAL MEDICATION

20:01.400 --> 20:02.567
THEY GAVE HER.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.733
SO ANY ANTIBIOTIC CREAMS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

20:04.733 --> 20:06.467
HER BODY JUST DID NOT LIKE.

20:06.467 --> 20:09.267
THOSE WERE USED, LIKE, FOR
INFECTION, POSSIBLE INFECTION,

20:09.267 --> 20:10.500
AND TO REDUCE PAIN?

20:10.500 --> 20:12.033
YEAH.
AND THEN THEY CAUSED MORE PAIN?

20:12.033 --> 20:13.900
YES.
POOR BABY!

20:13.900 --> 20:15.900
A LOT, AND I WAS, YOU KNOW,
FALLING APART.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.567
IT WAS JUST BRUTAL.
LIKE, SEEING YOUR CHILD IN PAIN

20:18.567 --> 20:21.433
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING IS REALLY HARD.

20:21.433 --> 20:23.000
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT
THE MENTAL STUFF.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.567
LIKE, IT SCARES
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

20:24.567 --> 20:27.967
I'VE SEEN JAZZ WHERE
THE DEPRESSION

20:27.967 --> 20:29.433
IS CAUSING HER SUCH PAIN,

20:29.433 --> 20:31.867
AND SHE'S BEEN LIKE, "MOMMY.
MAKE THIS FEELING GO AWAY."

20:31.867 --> 20:36.300
I'M DEFINITELY MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT JAZZ'S MENTAL WELL-BEING.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.667
WE CAN'T PREPARE OURSELVES

20:37.667 --> 20:39.067
FOR WHAT SHE'S GOING
TO BE LIKE MENTALLY.

20:39.067 --> 20:40.467
WE HAVE NO IDEA.

20:40.467 --> 20:43.800
SO HAVE YOU GUYS NARROWED
DOWN YOUR SURGEON SEARCH?

20:43.800 --> 20:47.467
YES, WE'VE FOUND A SURGEON,
MARCI BOWERS, WHO'S WONDERFUL.

20:47.467 --> 20:49.033
I HEAR SUCH NICE
THINGS ABOUT HER.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.967
SHE SAID ALL THE THINGS
THAT JAZZ WANTED TO HEAR.

20:50.967 --> 20:53.467
SHE REALLY WANTED
A ONE-STEP PROCEDURE,

20:53.467 --> 20:55.267
AND SHE LOOKED AT HER.
SHE'S LIKE,

20:55.267 --> 20:57.567
"YEAH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S SMALL, BUT WE GOT THIS,"

20:57.567 --> 21:01.133
OR, AS JAZZ WOULD SAY,
VAGINAL DEPTH.

21:01.133 --> 21:02.767
I COULD SEE JAZZ, LIKE,
DATING SOMEBODY,

21:02.767 --> 21:04.433
"WELL, HOW BIG ARE YOU?"

21:04.433 --> 21:07.067
YEAH, "I CAN ONLY GO 4 INCHES."

21:07.067 --> 21:12.400
RIGHT. "OH, YOU'RE 7? I'M SORRY.
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK OUT."

21:12.400 --> 21:14.067
ARE YOU EXCITED FOR PHILLY?

21:14.067 --> 21:15.600
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO EXCITED.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.533
THE PHILLY TRANS
HEALTH CONFERENCE

21:17.533 --> 21:20.533
IS A PLACE THAT MY MOM
AND I GO TO EVERY YEAR.

21:20.533 --> 21:23.300
IT'S THE LARGEST CONVENTION
FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE,

21:23.300 --> 21:24.800
THOUSANDS COME.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.367
YOU KNOW MY FRIEND NOELLE,
RIGHT?

21:26.367 --> 21:27.833
YEAH.
SHE'LL BE THERE.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.233
SHE'S REALLY SWEET.

21:29.233 --> 21:30.833
WE HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS THERE.

21:30.833 --> 21:34.367
WE HAVE A TABLE SET UP WHERE
WE TALK ABOUT OUR FOUNDATION.

21:34.367 --> 21:35.600
I LOVE IT.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.867
I JUST WANT TO MEET NEW PEOPLE.

21:36.867 --> 21:38.300
YEAH, LET'S MAKE
NEW FRIENDS THIS YEAR.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.200
I'M TIRED...
LIKE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO...

21:40.200 --> 21:43.300
I'M TIRED OF ALL Y'ALL PEOPLE.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.200
ALL RIGHT.
SO NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.633
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING
WITH YOU...

21:47.633 --> 21:49.667
LIKE, YOUR VAGINA?

21:49.667 --> 21:51.167
IT'S GOOD.
LIKE I SAID BEFORE,

21:51.167 --> 21:53.633
I'M PRETTY FULLY RECOVERED
BY NOW, I THINK.

21:53.633 --> 21:55.133
I'M NOT IN ANY PAIN.

21:55.133 --> 21:57.967
I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER MUCH OF,
LIKE, THE FIRST 2 WEEKS,

21:57.967 --> 21:59.600
AND MY MOM TELLS ME
THAT I ACTUALLY HAD, LIKE,

21:59.600 --> 22:02.933
AN ALLERGIC REACTION
TO THIS ANTIBIOTIC MEDICINE,

22:02.933 --> 22:04.400
AND THAT'S ONE OF
THE REASONS, LIKE,

22:04.400 --> 22:07.567
I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN,
APPARENTLY, SUPPOSEDLY.

22:07.567 --> 22:08.800
THAT'S GOOD THAT
YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.067
I'M GLAD I DON'T REMEMBER IT.
YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY.

22:11.067 --> 22:13.667
WHEN I GOT HOME AND I DIDN'T
HAVE ANY OF THOSE MEDICATIONS,

22:13.667 --> 22:15.800
IT WAS REALLY PAINFUL.
REALLY PAINFUL?

22:15.800 --> 22:17.900
WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO PEE
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

22:17.900 --> 22:20.300
IT WAS SO WEIRD FEELING.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.533
BUT NOW IT'S NORMAL? DOES IT
FEEL LIKE, JUST, REGULAR PEEING?

22:22.533 --> 22:23.900
YEAH, REGULAR PEEING.

22:23.900 --> 22:26.767
SO DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENT AT ALL,
LIKE, AS A PERSON OR JUST,

22:26.767 --> 22:28.367
LIKE, PHYSICALLY?

22:28.367 --> 22:30.100
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT AS DIFFERENT
AS I THOUGHT I WOULD FEEL,

22:30.100 --> 22:32.067
BU I FEEL COMPLETE NOW.

22:32.067 --> 22:34.167
THE FACT THAT SHE LOVES
HER BODY NOW

22:34.167 --> 22:36.500
AND FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE
IN HER OWN SKIN

22:36.500 --> 22:39.500
GIVES ME HOPE THAT MAYBE
I'LL FEEL THAT SAME WAY TOO.

22:39.500 --> 22:47.433
**

22:47.433 --> 22:50.800
HURRICANE IRMA IS A MONSTER
CATEGORY 5 STORM

22:50.800 --> 22:53.367
SLAMMING PARTS
OF THE CARIBBEAN.

22:53.367 --> 22:56.733
THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL STORM
EVER RECORDED

22:56.733 --> 22:58.233
IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.

22:58.233 --> 23:00.367
I JUST WENT OVER THE ISLAND
OF BARBUDA HOURS AGO.

23:00.367 --> 23:02.933
HEY, JEANETTE?
YEAH?

23:02.933 --> 23:05.467
CAN YOU COME DOWN,
AND CAN YOU BRING JAZZ?

23:05.467 --> 23:07.100
JAZZ, WHERE ARE YOU?

23:07.100 --> 23:08.700
...AND FLASH FLOODING.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.233
LET'S GET RIGHT TO CNN
METEOROLOGIST CHAD MYERS.

23:11.233 --> 23:12.967
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE GET THAT IT'S A HUGE STORM.

23:12.967 --> 23:14.433
THE QUESTION IS WHERE
IS IT GOING TO GO?

23:14.433 --> 23:15.967
WHAT IS IT GOING TO DO?

23:15.967 --> 23:18.667
A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
FROM HERE TO HERE,

23:18.667 --> 23:20.367
NOTICE THE BIG,
HARD RIGHT-HAND TURN.

23:20.367 --> 23:21.700
COULD SCOUR MIAMI BEACH

23:21.700 --> 23:24.067
ALL THE WAY UP EVEN INTO
NORTH CAROLINA.

23:24.067 --> 23:26.733
YOU STILL HAVE ABOUT
150 MILES EITHER WAY

23:26.733 --> 23:28.233
THAT THE STORM CAN GO.

23:28.233 --> 23:30.467
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT
CAT 5 HURRICANE

23:30.467 --> 23:32.900
THAT IS BIGGER
THAN OUR ENTIRE STATE,

23:32.900 --> 23:36.067
SO I KNOW WE'RE GETTING HIT,
I'M FREAKING OUT.

23:36.067 --> 23:38.500
RIGHT NOW, BARBUDA
REALLY TOOK A DIRECT HIT.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.900
AT 185 MILES PER HOUR,

23:39.900 --> 23:42.933
THERE MAY NOT BE VEGETATION
LEFT ON THE ISLAND.

23:42.933 --> 23:46.667
I'VE DEFINITELY EXPERIENCED
SOME CATEGORY 1s AND 2s AND 3s

23:46.667 --> 23:49.167
BUT, LIKE,
NOTHING AS BIG AS THIS.

23:49.167 --> 23:50.600
IT'S REALLY FRIGHTENING.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.833
WAIT, SO IF IT IS CATEGORY 5,
CAN IT BREAK DOWN THE HOUSE?

23:53.833 --> 23:55.167
LIKE, WILL THE HOUSE
GET DESTROYED?

23:55.167 --> 23:57.667
IT WILL PEEL OFF THE ROOF.
YEAH.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.467
WHAT ABOUT GRANDMA AND GRANDMA,
ARI, SANDER AND GRIFFEN?

23:59.467 --> 24:00.867
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?

24:00.867 --> 24:02.467
I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED
ABOUT COLLEGE KIDS.

24:02.467 --> 24:05.433
THEY DON'T, IN GENERAL,
TAKE THINGS SUPER SERIOUS.

24:05.433 --> 24:06.600
I'M GOING TO TALK TO THEM.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.400
I'M ENCOURAGING THEM
TO GO TO SHELTERS.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.867
ARI AND THE TWINS ARE ACTUALLY
IN NORTHERN-CENTRAL FLORIDA,

24:11.867 --> 24:14.967
AND IF THE HURRICANE
HITS FLORIDA DEAD CENTER,

24:14.967 --> 24:16.667
THAT'S WHERE THE KIDS ARE.

24:16.667 --> 24:20.167
SO, YOU KNOW, I'M BRACING MYSELF
FOR THE WORST UNFORTUNATELY.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.700
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
ARE HEADING OFF TO PHILLY.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.767
I FEEL A LOT BETTER KNOWING
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUT OF TOWN

24:24.767 --> 24:29.333
WHEN THE STORM HITS,
IN WHATEVER CAPACITY IT HITS.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.333
Jazz: IT MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE
BIT GUILTY KNOWING THAT

24:31.333 --> 24:33.267
MY MOM AND I ARE GOING TO BE
SAFE FROM THE STORM

24:33.267 --> 24:35.233
AT THE PHILADELPHIA
TRANS HEALTH CONFERENCE

24:35.233 --> 24:38.400
WHILE MY ENTIRE FAMILY
IS RIGHT IN THE PATH OF IT.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.833
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
YOU SHOULD COME WITH US

24:40.833 --> 24:42.800
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE
LEAVING YOU HERE ALONE.

24:42.800 --> 24:47.067
LOOK, I THINK WE SHOULD BE
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.

24:47.067 --> 24:48.567
FROM WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
ON THE NEWS,

24:48.567 --> 24:51.333
IT'S COMPLETELY UNCLEAR WHERE
THIS THING IS GOING TO LAND.

24:51.333 --> 24:52.567
I'M JUST NOT GOING
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE

24:52.567 --> 24:55.067
JUST BECAUSE WE MIGHT
GET HIT WITH THE STORM.

24:55.067 --> 24:57.333
YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO FEEL
THE EFFECTS NO MATTER WHAT

24:57.333 --> 24:59.067
BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER
THAN THE WHOLE STATE.

24:59.067 --> 25:03.067
LOOK, IF IT APPEARS THAT
THE STORM IS GOING TO HIT US

25:03.067 --> 25:04.767
WITH ANY MAJOR FORCE,

25:04.767 --> 25:06.467
I NEED TO PUT ON THE SHUTTERS,

25:06.467 --> 25:08.633
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE HOUSE IS SECURE.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.633
Jazz: MY BIGGEST FEAR
WITH THIS HURRICANE

25:10.633 --> 25:13.800
IS THAT THE EYE COULD
POTENTIALLY GO OVER OUR HOUSE

25:13.800 --> 25:16.067
AND DESTROY EVERYTHING.

25:16.067 --> 25:19.333
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE MY DAD
BEHIND ALONE TO ENDURE THIS ALL.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.600
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF YOU SITTING HERE ALONE

25:21.600 --> 25:24.100
IN A HURRICANE.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.067
WE'RE HEADING TO

25:28.067 --> 25:29.700
THE PHILADELPHIA TRANS HEALTH
CONFERENCE

25:29.700 --> 25:31.333
WITH HURRICANE IRMA ON ITS WAY.

25:31.333 --> 25:34.400
185-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.900
ARE YOU GUYS STAYING
AT YOUR FRAT HOUSE?

25:36.900 --> 25:38.567
YEAH.

25:41.333 --> 25:46.967
**

25:46.967 --> 25:49.300
OH, HELLO.
HI. OH, MY GOD.

25:49.300 --> 25:50.800
YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL!
THANK YOU.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.567
MICHAELA IS ONE OF MY
NEW FRIENDS,

25:52.567 --> 25:54.067
WHO I MET AT A PRIDE FESTIVAL,

25:54.067 --> 25:56.567
AND SHE INVITED ME
TO THIS MIXER.

25:56.567 --> 25:59.100
I KNOW.
I, LIKE, DID BRAIDS IN MY HAIR.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.800
LIKE, I'M ALWAYS
TOO LAZY FOR THAT,

26:00.800 --> 26:02.067
BUT I DID IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

26:02.067 --> 26:03.433
YOU PUT EFFORT.

26:03.433 --> 26:04.600
I PUT EFFORT.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.400
IN THE PAST, I FELT AWKWARD
AND RELUCTANT

26:07.400 --> 26:09.233
TO JUMP INTO SOCIAL SITUATIONS

26:09.233 --> 26:12.267
BECAUSE OF THE ANXIETY
IT CAUSES ME.

26:12.267 --> 26:14.367
SO HOW OLD ARE YOU GUYS?
I'M 16.

26:14.367 --> 26:15.733
OH, ME TOO, ME TOO.

26:15.733 --> 26:18.567
BUT I REALLY WANT TO BE
OPEN TO EXPLORE DATING

26:18.567 --> 26:20.067
A LITTLE BIT MORE,

26:20.067 --> 26:24.067
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M READY
TO IMPRESS SOMEONE OUT THERE.

26:24.067 --> 26:27.667
OH, THAT SOUNDS SO WEIRD,
BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S TRUE.

26:27.667 --> 26:28.900
IT'S AN AWESOME TURNOUT.

26:28.900 --> 26:30.333
I NEVER EXPECTED THIS
MANY PEOPLE TO SHOW UP.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.600
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,
LIKE, FOUR OF US

26:32.600 --> 26:34.067
BECAUSE OF THE HURRICANE.

26:34.067 --> 26:35.867
YEAH, MY MOM IS, LIKE,
FREAKING OUT

26:35.867 --> 26:39.167
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING OUT OF TOWN,
AND MY DAD IS GOING TO BE ALONE.

26:39.167 --> 26:41.333
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE GOING
TO START GROUP NOW,

26:41.333 --> 26:44.700
SO JUST OPEN UP THE CIRCLE,
LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

26:44.700 --> 26:47.267
TODAY, I'M HOPING THAT JAZZ
MAKES SOME NEW FRIENDS,

26:47.267 --> 26:50.067
BONDS WITH SOME NEW PEOPLE
AND PUTS HERSELF OUT THERE

26:50.067 --> 26:52.767
BECAUSE JAZZ IS NEVER GOING
TO DISCOVER WHO SHE TRULY IS

26:52.767 --> 26:54.900
UNTIL SHE PUTS HERSELF
INTO SITUATIONS

26:54.900 --> 26:57.067
THAT MAY BE
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR HER.

26:57.067 --> 26:58.367
IF YOU GUYS ALWAYS
COME TO GROUP,

26:58.367 --> 27:01.067
YOU KNOW WE JUST ALWAYS
START WITH THE GO-AROUND,

27:01.067 --> 27:03.133
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
YOUR NAME, YOUR AGE,

27:03.133 --> 27:05.600
AND THEN THE QUESTION
OF THE DAY IS GOING TO BE...

27:05.600 --> 27:07.533
WHAT IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT QUALITY

27:07.533 --> 27:09.833
THAT YOU LOOK FOR
IN A CLOSE FRIEND?

27:09.833 --> 27:11.800
HI, MY NAME IS JOJO.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.467
WHAT DO I LOOK FOR IN A FRIEND?

27:13.467 --> 27:16.633
WELL, LOYALTY AND SOMEONE
WHO CAN ENJOY MY TRUE LAUGH

27:16.633 --> 27:17.867
BECAUSE WHEN I TRULY LAUGH,

27:17.867 --> 27:21.300
I SOUND LIKE A BANSHEE
WITH A SINUS INFECTION.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.333
Jazz: AS WE'RE DOING
OUR INTRODUCTIONS,

27:23.333 --> 27:25.233
EVERYONE IS SAYING GREAT THINGS.

27:25.233 --> 27:27.067
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

27:27.067 --> 27:28.833
WHAT TYPE OF FRIEND
THEY LOOK FOR,

27:28.833 --> 27:31.267
AND I AGREE WITH THEM ON
SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS,

27:31.267 --> 27:33.167
AND THEY ALL JUST SEEM SO FUN.

27:33.167 --> 27:35.633
I JUST GOT A RETAINER,
SO I HAVE A LOW-GRADE LISP,

27:35.633 --> 27:39.600
AND IT'S NOT THE GAME,

27:39.600 --> 27:42.800
BUT I GUESS IT ADDS
CHARACTER TO ME.

27:42.800 --> 27:46.733
I ALWAYS SAY THAT I WANT TO MEET
MY LOVER NATURALLY,

27:46.733 --> 27:49.233
LIKE, IN A BATHROOM,
OR WE BUMP INTO EACH OTHER

27:49.233 --> 27:51.167
AND THE BOOKS
GO FLYING EVERYWHERE.

27:51.167 --> 27:54.200
ANYWAY, I DON'T KNOW
IF GOING TO A MIXER

27:54.200 --> 27:56.200
IS NECESSARILY THAT NATURAL.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.600
I JUST KNOW THAT I'M NOT
GOING TO MEET SOMEONE

27:58.600 --> 28:02.400
LYING IN BED WATCHING TV.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.167
HEY, EVERYONE.
I'M JAZZ.

28:04.167 --> 28:08.133
I AM 16 YEARS OLD,
AND WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A FRIEND

28:08.133 --> 28:09.767
IS JUST SOMEONE
I CAN DISH OUT WITH.

28:09.767 --> 28:11.833
LIKE, I'M BRUTALLY
HONEST SOMETIMES,

28:11.833 --> 28:14.200
AND I MAY SAY SOMETHING,
LIKE, CRITICAL,

28:14.200 --> 28:15.867
AND I WANT THEM TO BE
ABLE TO HANDLE THAT

28:15.867 --> 28:18.367
AND SAY SOMETHING CRITICAL
BACK TO ME AS WELL.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.067
BUT I FEEL LIKE MY ANSWER
MAY HAVE BEEN

28:24.067 --> 28:25.600
A LITTLE BIT TOO HARSH,

28:25.600 --> 28:27.067
AND IT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BIT.

28:27.067 --> 28:31.967
SO NOW, GUYS, WHAT WE WANTED
TO DO IS HAVE YOU PAIR OFF

28:31.967 --> 28:35.467
WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU LIKED
WHAT THEY LOOKED FOR A FRIEND

28:35.467 --> 28:37.067
AND HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION.

28:37.067 --> 28:39.767
Jazz: AT THIS POINT, I REALLY
HOPE THAT PEOPLE

28:39.767 --> 28:41.500
WILL STILL WANT
TO TALK TO ME.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.767
Woman:
DON'T GO TO YOUR REGULARS.

28:42.767 --> 28:45.067
GO TO SOMEONE
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

28:45.067 --> 28:46.600
I LOVE YOU,
AND I'M STEALING YOU.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.333
OKIE-DOKIE.

28:48.333 --> 28:52.733
MICHAELA ABANDONS ME,
AND I FEEL A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

28:52.733 --> 28:56.567
I'M ALONE, AND NOW IT'S DOWN
TO ME TO SOCIALIZE.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.567
MY NAME IS EVAN.
SO NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

29:00.567 --> 29:02.067
IVAN?
EVAN.

29:02.067 --> 29:03.500
EVAN! OH, I'M LIKE "IVAN."
SORRY.

29:03.500 --> 29:04.533
I LIKE YOUR SHIRT BY THE WAY.

29:04.533 --> 29:06.500
THANK YOU.
DOES IT MAKE YOU HUNGRY?

29:06.500 --> 29:09.067
THAT'S, LIKE, MY DREAM
ON A SHIRT, FOR REAL.

29:09.067 --> 29:12.967
PEOPLE START COMING UP TO TALK
TO ME, AND I'M REALLY SURPRISED.

29:12.967 --> 29:15.600
I WANTED TO SAY WHAT EVERYONE
ELSE SAID, AND THEN, BY THE END,

29:15.600 --> 29:18.067
I WAS LIKE, I JUST MADE UP
WITH SOMETHING SPONTANEOUS.

29:18.067 --> 29:19.433
YEAH, I MEAN, EXACTLY.
IT WAS SO NEGATIVE.

29:19.433 --> 29:21.100
I'M LIKE, "SOMEONE I COULD BE
CRITICAL WITH

29:21.100 --> 29:22.600
AND DISH IT OUT WITH."

29:22.600 --> 29:23.733
NO, NO, BUT, LIKE, THAT'S SO
TRUE BECAUSE YOU WANT SOMEBODY

29:23.733 --> 29:24.867
TO BE, LIKE, REALLY,
REALLY REAL WITH ME.

29:24.867 --> 29:26.267
THAT'S A REAL FRIEND.

29:26.267 --> 29:27.800
IT KIND OF CAME OFF
THE WRONG WAY WHEN I SAID IT.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.600
LIKE, SO, AS SOMETHING,
LIKE, RUDE.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.333
WE GOT IT. WE GET IT.
IT'S FINE.

29:31.333 --> 29:32.833
WE'RE ALL LIKE THAT.

29:32.833 --> 29:34.433
EVERYONE IS SO COOL HERE.

29:34.433 --> 29:36.433
YEAH.
WELL, WE TRY.

29:36.433 --> 29:39.067
WHAT'S UP
GOOD.

29:39.067 --> 29:41.967
I THINK JAZZ FEELS MORE
COMFORTABLE THAN USUAL TODAY.

29:41.967 --> 29:46.567
I KNOW THAT SHE HAS A LOT OF
ISSUES BEING IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

29:46.567 --> 29:50.200
SHE'S JUDGED QUITE A BIT
BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW HER,

29:50.200 --> 29:54.233
AND SO TO SEE A GROUP
THAT IS SAFE FOR HER

29:54.233 --> 29:57.067
IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING.

29:57.067 --> 29:58.400
WE'RE GETTING READY TO GO.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.167
WE JUST WANTED TO SAY
GOODBYE TO ALL OF YOU.

30:00.167 --> 30:02.067
WE'RE DRIVING A LONG...

30:02.067 --> 30:04.233
YOU SHOULD COME BACK.
YEAH, I WANT TO.

30:04.233 --> 30:05.600
IT'S SO MUCH FUN.
IT'S REALLY COOL, YEAH.

30:05.600 --> 30:09.033
EITHER WAY, I THINK WE ALL
SHOULD, LIKE, EXCHANGE NUMBERS.

30:09.033 --> 30:11.767
Jazz: TODAY, I DON'T THINK
I FOUND A LOVE INTEREST,

30:11.767 --> 30:13.733
BUT I LEARNED THAT I CAN BE

30:13.733 --> 30:16.133
PRETTY COMFORTABLE
IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS,

30:16.133 --> 30:17.933
AND I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD.

30:17.933 --> 30:21.200
I THINK MY PARENTS WILL BE HAPPY
THAT I MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.700
SO, WIN-WIN.

30:23.700 --> 30:32.367
**

30:32.367 --> 30:34.967
YOUR MOTHER HAS BEEN GLUED
TO THE WEATHER REPORTS.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.967
THIS IS... THIS HURTS.
THIS IS VERY TOUGH.

30:36.967 --> 30:40.433
BUT THIS IS LIKE... YOU'VE
NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE.

30:40.433 --> 30:43.200
THIS IS MY PARENTS' FIRST
VERY BIG HURRICANE,

30:43.200 --> 30:47.833
AND IF IRMA MAKES A DIRECT HIT,
THAT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

30:47.833 --> 30:49.700
I REALLY WANT THEM TO EVACUATE,

30:49.700 --> 30:51.133
BUT THEY WANT TO STAY
IN THEIR CONDO,

30:51.133 --> 30:52.733
SO I'M GOING TO CHECK
TO MAKE SURE

30:52.733 --> 30:55.900
THAT THEY ARE VERY,
VERY, VERY PREPARED.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.800
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
MANY OF THESE.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.833
THIS ONE IS, SOUNDS...

30:59.833 --> 31:01.600
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I HAVEN'T...

31:01.600 --> 31:02.633
PRETTY BAD.

31:02.633 --> 31:04.867
REALLY BEEN THROUGH
ONE THIS SIZE.

31:04.867 --> 31:06.567
I'M GETTING REALLY NERVOUS.

31:06.567 --> 31:10.067
JACKY HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A WORST-CASE-SCENARIO PERSON.

31:10.067 --> 31:11.400
JACK, A 5 IS COMING.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.900
A 4 OR A 5, THAT'S A HECK
OF A POWERFUL STORM.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.467
I'M KIND OF LUCKY BECAUSE
I'VE HAD AN AIRPLANE TICKET

31:17.467 --> 31:20.067
TO GO TO PHILLY FOR THE PHILLY
TRANS HEALTH CONFERENCE

31:20.067 --> 31:21.200
FOR MONTHS AND
MONTHS AND MONTHS.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.933
FOR JAZZ.
I MEAN, I HAVE A HOTEL ROOM.

31:22.933 --> 31:25.267
I'M GETTING THE HECK OUT
OF HERE JUST IN TIME,

31:25.267 --> 31:27.600
BUT GREG DOESN'T WANT
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.700
I DON'T THINK HE REALIZES
HOW LARGE THIS IS

31:29.700 --> 31:30.967
AND HOW SCARY IT IS.

31:30.967 --> 31:33.167
I UNDERSTAND THAT HE
WOULD FEEL BETTER

31:33.167 --> 31:36.300
JUST GUARDING THE HOUSE
DURING A STORM LIKE THIS,

31:36.300 --> 31:38.467
BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT GREG.

31:38.467 --> 31:41.600
HE'S IN A TWO-STORY HOUSE
WITH A ROOF

31:41.600 --> 31:44.533
THAT CAN BE BLOWN OFF
IN A CATEGORY 5 STORM.

31:44.533 --> 31:47.833
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
THE GRANDCHILDREN.

31:47.833 --> 31:50.667
THEIR FRATERNITY HOUSE, I FEEL
LIKE IT COULD BLOW RIGHT OVER.

31:50.667 --> 31:51.967
AND WHAT ABOUT ARI'S?

31:51.967 --> 31:55.067
HER HOUSE IS SO FLIMSY.
IT'S SO OLD.

31:55.067 --> 31:57.567
I SAID TO THEM, "GO TO
A SHELTER. JUST GO TO SHELTER."

31:57.567 --> 31:58.967
WILL THEY LISTEN TO YOU?

31:58.967 --> 32:00.233
I DON'T KNOW.

32:00.233 --> 32:03.767
THE STORM IS SUPPOSED
TO HIT GAINESVILLE,

32:03.767 --> 32:05.733
WHERE THE KIDS
ARE GOING TO SCHOOL,

32:05.733 --> 32:09.167
AND THEY'RE REALLY NOT CONCERNED
THAT I WANT THEM IN A SHELTER.

32:09.167 --> 32:12.200
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO HERE
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFE.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.200
LET'S DO A TOUR.
OKAY.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.900
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.700
LOOK AT THIS.
THAT WILL CLOSE,

32:18.700 --> 32:21.267
AND WE HAVE ONE
COMING IN FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

32:21.267 --> 32:23.167
THESE GET PULLED TOGETHER.

32:23.167 --> 32:24.867
I'M NOT GOING TO PULL
THE WHOLE THING.

32:24.867 --> 32:29.067
I'VE ALREADY BOUGHT LOTS AND
LOTS OF WATER, AS YOU CAN SEE.

32:29.067 --> 32:30.400
DO YOU HAVE CANNED FOOD?

32:30.400 --> 32:31.900
YES, IN MY PANTRY.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.300
MM-HMM.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.867
WE'LL SHOW YOU ALSO WHERE
YOUR MOTHER MIGHT CONSIDER

32:35.867 --> 32:38.800
GETTING AWAY FROM THINGS IF THE
STORM GETS A LITTLE TOO HEAVY.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.867
OKAY, SO WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO BE, MOM?

32:40.867 --> 32:44.200
IN HER WARDROBE CLOSET HERE,
AND SHE'LL GO IN THERE.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.067
BUT THAT'S AN EXTERIOR WALL,

32:46.067 --> 32:48.700
AND THEY SAY DON'T BE
NEAR AN EXTERIOR WALL.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.833
OKAY.

32:49.833 --> 32:51.067
BECAUSE SOMETHING CAN GO
RIGHT THROUGH THAT WALL.

32:51.067 --> 32:54.233
YOU ARE UNDOING EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE TRIED

32:54.233 --> 32:55.567
TO DO WITH YOUR MOTHER.
YOU KNOW THAT.

32:55.567 --> 32:58.900
I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT THE FEAR
IN YOU A LITTLE BIT.

32:58.900 --> 33:00.567
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK HARD.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

33:00.567 --> 33:01.567
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
THE FEAR IN HER.

33:01.567 --> 33:02.800
NO, BUT SHE WANTS TO BE IN HERE.

33:02.800 --> 33:03.867
THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE.

33:03.867 --> 33:05.167
I'M TRYING TO TAKE
AWAY HER FEAR.

33:05.167 --> 33:07.533
I'M JUST BEING CAUTIOUS
BECAUSE IT ONLY TAKES ONE.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.300
**

33:12.300 --> 33:16.067
HERE IN MIAMI, ALL EYES
ARE ON HURRICANE IRMA.

33:16.067 --> 33:20.167
SHE IS COMING RIGHT TO WHERE
WE ARE AT THIS HOUR.

33:20.167 --> 33:23.200
THE RED CROSS SAYS THE STORM
HAS ALREADY BATTERED

33:23.200 --> 33:26.233
1.2 MILLION PEOPLE.

33:26.233 --> 33:27.700
Jeanette: IT'S JUST SCARY
TO WATCH THE NEWS.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.567
EVERY TIME I TURN IT ON,
I LITERALLY START SWEATING.

33:30.567 --> 33:33.733
I AM LEAVING MY WHOLE
FAMILY, YOU, EVERYONE.

33:33.733 --> 33:35.933
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
I WANT TO LEAVE.

33:35.933 --> 33:38.700
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD ALL
JUST GET OUT OF THE STATE.

33:38.700 --> 33:42.067
I AM REALLY, REALLY UNHAPPY
ABOUT THE FACT

33:42.067 --> 33:44.200
THAT GREG IS RIDING
OUT THE STORM,

33:44.200 --> 33:46.967
BUT GREG IS VERY STUBBORN.

33:46.967 --> 33:48.433
AND YOU PROMISE YOU'RE GOING
TO PUT SHUTTERS

33:48.433 --> 33:49.800
ON THE WINDOWS
OVER HERE?

33:49.800 --> 33:53.167
YEAH. AS LONG AS IT'S GOING TO
BE A TROPICAL STORM OR MORE.

33:53.167 --> 33:54.567
OH, IT'S GOING TO BE.

33:54.567 --> 33:56.333
THEY SHOWED A PICTURE
OF HURRICANE ANDREW.

33:56.333 --> 34:00.567
IT WAS LIKE THIS IN THE PICTURE,
AND IRMA WAS LIKE THIS.

34:00.567 --> 34:02.067
IT'S MONSTROUS.

34:02.067 --> 34:03.500
IT'S ENORMOUS.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.400
I UNDERSTAND JEANETTE'S CONCERN,

34:05.400 --> 34:07.167
BUT WE REALLY HAVE
TO WATCH THE STORM.

34:07.167 --> 34:10.067
THEY HAVEN'T CONCLUSIVELY SAID
IT'S GOING THIS DIRECTION,

34:10.067 --> 34:11.600
THIS DIRECTION
OR THIS DIRECTION.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.800
SO, IN MY MIND, NOW IS
THE TIME TO PREPARE.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.433
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO PANIC.

34:16.433 --> 34:17.900
THE KIDS ARE UP AT COLLEGE.

34:17.900 --> 34:21.500
THAT'S GOOD, AND I'M ABLE
TO GET THE HOUSE IN ORDER,

34:21.500 --> 34:25.267
AND I PROMISE YOU,
IF THERE'S AN EVACUATION ORDER,

34:25.267 --> 34:27.900
I WILL GET OUT OF DODGE.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.800
I FEEL BETTER KNOWING THAT
YOU GUYS ARE OUT OF TOWN.

34:31.800 --> 34:35.233
IT'S JUST NOT GREAT.
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

34:35.233 --> 34:38.567
I'M SCARED.

34:38.567 --> 34:41.667
ON THE NEWS, IT WENT FROM
CATEGORY 5 TO CATEGORY 4

34:41.667 --> 34:43.067
TO CATEGORY 5 AGAIN.

34:43.067 --> 34:44.200
I'M NAUSEOUS.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.400
MY MIND IS SPINNING.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.667
ARE YOU ABOUT TO THROW UP?
I DON'T KNOW.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.100
I DON'T FEEL WELL.
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:53.467 --> 34:56.433
WANT TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE
ON OUR MASSIVE HURRICANE.

34:56.433 --> 34:58.467
HURRICANE WARNINGS IN EFFECT
FOR THE BAHAMAS

34:58.467 --> 35:00.400
AND ALMOST THE ENTIRE
STATE OF FLORIDA.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.533
WATCHES TO THE NORTH
STARTING TO GET EXTENDED

35:02.533 --> 35:05.133
BECAUSE THE WINDS ARE GOING
TO BE DANGEROUS THERE AS WELL,

35:05.133 --> 35:07.400
KNOCKING OUT POWER
TO POSSIBLY 4 TO 5 MILLION,

35:07.400 --> 35:09.900
ACCORDING TO FEMA.

35:09.900 --> 35:15.833
**

35:15.833 --> 35:18.300
WE'RE ON A PLANE RIGHT NOW
HEADING TO THE PHILADELPHIA

35:18.300 --> 35:19.500
TRANS HEALTH CONFERENCE,

35:19.500 --> 35:21.433
AND WHILE WE'RE
BOTH SUPER EXCITED,

35:21.433 --> 35:24.267
WE'RE ALSO WORRIED BECAUSE
DAD IS STUCK AT HOME

35:24.267 --> 35:26.267
WITH HURRICANE IRMA ON ITS WAY,

35:26.267 --> 35:28.767
AND WE'RE JUST HOPING
THAT HE STAYS SAFE.

35:28.767 --> 35:30.533
AND THE KIDS, TOO,
IN GAINESVILLE.

35:30.533 --> 35:36.567
**

35:36.567 --> 35:38.733
I WANT TO CALL EVERYBODY
BEFORE WE HAVE TO GO OVER

35:38.733 --> 35:39.567
TO THE CONFERENCE.

35:39.567 --> 35:41.200
WHO DO YOU WANT TO CALL FIRST?

35:41.200 --> 35:43.367
DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL THE BOYS?

35:43.367 --> 35:44.767
YEAH, LET'S CALL THE BOYS.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.800
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD
TO FOCUS ON THE CONFERENCE

35:46.800 --> 35:50.133
LIKE I NORMALLY DO BECAUSE
MY HUSBAND AND MY FAMILY

35:50.133 --> 35:52.933
ARE DOWN THERE,
MY PARENTS, EVERYBODY.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.133
HEY.

35:54.133 --> 35:56.800
HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING
ABOUT THE STORM COMING?

35:56.800 --> 35:58.400
IT'S PRETTY SCARY.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.833
I MEAN, MY SIBLINGS ARE EXPECTED
TO BE IN THE DIRECT PATH

36:01.833 --> 36:03.767
WHERE HURRICANE IRMA
IS GOING TO GO,

36:03.767 --> 36:08.167
AND I'M SCARED FOR
WHAT'S GOING TO COME.

36:08.167 --> 36:11.833
WAIT, ARE YOU GUYS STAYING
AT YOUR FRAT HOUSE,

36:11.833 --> 36:13.800
OR WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:13.800 --> 36:15.533
YEAH, I THINK WE'RE
STAYING UNLESS

36:15.533 --> 36:17.100
WE'RE TOLD THAT IT'S NOT SAFE.

36:17.100 --> 36:19.633
SO, NO, WHO'S GOING TO TELL
YOU TO LEAVE THAT HOUSE,

36:19.633 --> 36:21.933
AND THEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

36:21.933 --> 36:23.800
THEIR FRATERNITY HOUSE
IS PRETTY OLD,

36:23.800 --> 36:25.267
AND, OF COURSE,
MY WORST NIGHTMARE

36:25.267 --> 36:26.533
IS THAT SOMEBODY
IS GOING TO GET HURT.

36:26.533 --> 36:27.600
WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.100
YOU GUYS GO HAVE FUN AT PHILLY.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.967
WELL, I CAN'T HAVE FUN
KNOWING YOU'RE GETTING HIT

36:31.967 --> 36:35.867
BY A HURRICANE, SO STAY IN TOUCH
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND BE SAFE.

36:35.867 --> 36:37.467
-WE'LL TALK SOON.
-OKAY.

36:37.467 --> 36:38.633
-BYE.
-BYE.

36:38.633 --> 36:42.067
BYE, LOVE YOU.

36:42.067 --> 36:45.400
I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.
THIS SUCKS.

36:47.967 --> 36:50.833
STRESS, SO MUCH STRESS.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.367
I KNOW.

36:52.367 --> 36:55.600
EVEN THOUGH I AM WORRIED
ABOUT MY FAMILY,

36:55.600 --> 36:57.067
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT I STAY CALM

36:57.067 --> 36:59.567
BECAUSE MY MOM
IS PANICKING A LOT.

36:59.567 --> 37:00.933
I LOVE YOU.
I'M REALLY WORRIED.

37:00.933 --> 37:05.533
SO STAY SAFE.

37:05.533 --> 37:09.367
I KNOW SHE JUST DOESN'T LIKE
THIS FEELING OF HELPLESSNESS.

37:09.367 --> 37:11.533
ALL RIGHT. WHO DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL RIGHT NOW?

37:11.533 --> 37:14.200
DAD.
DAD?

37:14.200 --> 37:18.333
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

37:18.333 --> 37:21.300
MY STOMACH IS IN KNOTS
BECAUSE I'M SO WORRIED.

37:21.300 --> 37:23.400
I'VE BEEN TEXTING
WITH THE KIDS,

37:23.400 --> 37:26.600
AND GAINESVILLE MIGHT BE
GETTING SOME STRONG WINDS.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.067
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE NOT...

37:29.067 --> 37:31.333
YEAH. I'M CONCERNED.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.533
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT MY PHONE.

37:32.533 --> 37:33.800
I GOT AN E-MAIL.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.767
OUR FLIGHT'S BEEN CANCELED,
SO WE DON'T KNOW

37:35.767 --> 37:38.167
WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

37:38.167 --> 37:41.167
YEAH. I MEAN, THIS STORM
TOMORROW IS REALLY GOING TO BE

37:41.167 --> 37:42.800
THE MAIN EVENT IN TERMS OF,

37:42.800 --> 37:45.133
YOU KNOW,
THE BAD HURRICANE WEATHER.

37:45.133 --> 37:46.700
I REALLY STARTED WORKING
ON EVERYTHING

37:46.700 --> 37:47.933
AND GOT EVERYTHING IN ORDER,

37:47.933 --> 37:50.933
SO I'VE WAS ABLE TO MOVE
ALL THE FURNITURE,

37:50.933 --> 37:53.567
EVERYTHING IN
FROM OUTSIDE INSIDE.

37:53.567 --> 37:54.800
YOU'RE ALL SET.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.733
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO GO
TAKE A PEEK OUT.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.533
HOLD ON A SECOND.

37:59.533 --> 38:02.133
WHOA.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.500
Jeanette: THE STORM ALREADY
LOOKS REALLY BAD,

38:10.500 --> 38:13.633
AND IT'S ONLY GOING
TO GET WORSE AND WORSE.

38:13.633 --> 38:16.733
LET'S TALK AGAIN, FOR SURE,
BEFORE THE STORM COMES.

38:16.733 --> 38:18.900
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M
GOING TO LOSE POWER,

38:18.900 --> 38:22.133
SO I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GOING
TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU NEXT.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.133
DON'T WORRY. I'LL BE OKAY.
THE HOUSE IS SECURE.

38:25.133 --> 38:26.667
EVERYTHING IS SECURE.

38:26.667 --> 38:28.300
ALL RIGHTY.
ALL RIGHT.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.667
LOVE YOU GUYS.
LOVE YOU, TOO.

38:29.667 --> 38:33.267
LOVE YOU.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.067
I'M WORRIED.

38:35.067 --> 38:36.433
I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

38:36.433 --> 38:37.800
MY STOMACH HURTS.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.067
I FEEL NAUSEOUS.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.333
MY MIND IS SPINNING.

38:40.333 --> 38:41.833
I'M THINKING ALL THE THINGS
ANYBODY WOULD THINK

38:41.833 --> 38:44.467
IF THE HURRICANE WAS HEADED
TOWARDS YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS

38:44.467 --> 38:46.833
AND PARENTS, LIKE,
EVERYBODY THAT YOU LOVE.

38:46.833 --> 38:49.333
I JUST WANT TO GO
THE RESTROOM FOR A SECOND.

38:49.333 --> 38:50.767
ARE YOU ABOUT TO THROW UP?
I DON'T KNOW.

38:50.767 --> 38:52.067
I DON'T FEEL WELL.

38:52.067 --> 38:54.400
I'M JUST...
MAYBE IT'S MY NERVES.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.633
LET ME JUST CATCH A BREATH
FOR A SECOND.

38:56.633 --> 38:58.267
SORRY.

38:58.267 --> 39:00.300
I AM FEELING SO AWFUL RIGHT NOW.

39:00.300 --> 39:01.367
MY STOMACH HURTS.

39:01.367 --> 39:02.600
I'M DOUBLED OVER.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.900
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING
TO THROW UP.

39:05.900 --> 39:06.933
ARE YOU OKAY?

39:06.933 --> 39:08.267
I'M FINE.

39:08.267 --> 39:10.067
DID YOU THROW UP?

39:14.433 --> 39:17.433
IT'S HARD TO ASSURE MY MOM THAT
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY

39:17.433 --> 39:20.867
BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT SURE IF
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY.

39:20.867 --> 39:27.867
**

39:27.867 --> 39:34.867
**

39:34.867 --> 39:36.167
HERE YOU GO.
THANKS SO MUCH.

39:36.167 --> 39:37.833
NO PROBLEM.
THANK YOU.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.533
Jazz: AT THIS CONFERENCE,
WE HAVE A TABLE SET UP

39:40.533 --> 39:42.467
WHERE WE TALK ABOUT
OUR FOUNDATION,

39:42.467 --> 39:44.567
THE TRANSKIDS
PURPLE RAINBOW FOUNDATION.

39:44.567 --> 39:47.067
WHILE IT MAY BE HARD TO GET
MY MIND OFF OF THE HURRICANE,

39:47.067 --> 39:50.067
I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS
CONFERENCE AND TRY TO ENJOY IT.

39:50.067 --> 39:51.767
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

39:51.767 --> 39:53.833
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THANK YOU TO YOU GUYS.

39:53.833 --> 39:56.500
I CAME OUT TO MY MOM ABOUT,
LIKE, 6 YEARS AGO,

39:56.500 --> 39:57.833
AND WHEN I FIRST
CAME OUT TO HER,

39:57.833 --> 40:00.100
SHE KIND OF, JUST, LIKE,
IGNORED IT AND LET IT GO,

40:00.100 --> 40:02.533
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN A LOT
OF YOUR INTERVIEWS CAME ON,

40:02.533 --> 40:04.267
AND I WAS ABLE TO USE
THAT AS A TALKING POINT

40:04.267 --> 40:06.667
TO START THESE CONVERSATIONS.
AWESOME. GOOD.

40:06.667 --> 40:08.767
AND SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE
PARENTS BEING ACCEPTING,

40:08.767 --> 40:10.633
SO I REALLY WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

40:10.633 --> 40:12.767
THAT'S AWESOME.
THAT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY.

40:12.767 --> 40:14.033
WE LOVE TO HEAR THAT.

40:14.033 --> 40:15.367
YEAH.

40:15.367 --> 40:17.767
WE ARE MEETING A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED

40:17.767 --> 40:20.500
BY US AND SHARING OUR STORY,

40:20.500 --> 40:23.467
AND BEING ABLE TO SPEAK TO THOSE
PEOPLE DIRECTLY IS REALLY COOL.

40:23.467 --> 40:24.800
ARE YOU GUYS TWINS?

40:24.800 --> 40:27.700
WE ARE IN THE SOUL.
WE'RE TWINS IN SOUL.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.233
IS YOUR FAMILY
WITH YOU GUYS UP HERE?

40:29.233 --> 40:30.467
NO, THEY'RE BACK AT HOME.

40:30.467 --> 40:33.900
SO THEY'RE GOING TO
ENDURE THE HURRICANE.

40:33.900 --> 40:35.600
Jeanette: I'M PRETTY GOOD
AT PUTTING THINGS

40:35.600 --> 40:37.433
IN MY BACK POCKET
WHEN I NEED TO.

40:37.433 --> 40:41.633
SO I CAN PUT ON A SMILEY FACE
WHEN I'M TALKING TO SOMEBODY

40:41.633 --> 40:43.300
BECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE THAT I
HAVE TO HAVE SERIOUS

40:43.300 --> 40:45.400
CONVERSATIONS WITH,
BUT AS SOON AS THEY WALK AWAY,

40:45.400 --> 40:47.233
I'M LIKE, ALL RIGHT, PHONE,
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IRMA

40:47.233 --> 40:51.033
BECAUSE HOW CAN WE COMPLETELY
FOCUS ON THE CONFERENCE

40:51.033 --> 40:53.200
KNOWING WHAT'S
HAPPENING BACK HOME?

40:53.200 --> 40:54.467
-AWESOME.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.

40:54.467 --> 40:55.900
NICE TO MEET YOU.

40:55.900 --> 40:56.967
-HEY.
-HI.

40:56.967 --> 40:58.833
-HELLO.

40:58.833 --> 41:01.067
YOU GUYS KNOW IF OUR FLIGHT
HAS BEEN CANCELED?

41:01.067 --> 41:02.400
YES, IT'S CANCELED.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.833
I LOOKED ON THE NEWS.

41:03.833 --> 41:07.500
IT WENT FROM CATEGORY 5 TO
CATEGORY 4 TO CATEGORY 5 AGAIN.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.133
OH, MY GOODNESS.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.100
I FEEL BAD FOR, LIKE,
MY DAD AND MY BROTHER

41:11.100 --> 41:12.600
BECAUSE WE HAD
TO LEAVE THEM THERE.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.300
I KNOW. WELL, THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.200
ARE THEY ALL BOARDED UP
OR SHUTTERED UP?

41:18.200 --> 41:22.867
WE HAVE ALL THE WINDOWS
SHUTTERED, AND THEN WE HAVE,

41:22.867 --> 41:25.867
LIKE, ENOUGH ANIMAL CRACKERS
TO LAST A LIFETIME.

41:25.867 --> 41:27.867
OH, GOOD.
OKAY.

41:27.867 --> 41:30.267
MY DAD AND MY BROTHER
DON'T WANT TO LEAVE FLORIDA.

41:30.267 --> 41:33.067
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
ALL OF OUR PROPERTY IS SAFE,

41:33.067 --> 41:34.133
AND I WORRY ABOUT THEM.

41:34.133 --> 41:35.233
THEY'RE MY FAMILY,
AND I LOVE THEM,

41:35.233 --> 41:37.100
AND I DON'T WANT
TO SEE THEM GET HURT.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.600
WE'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER, OKAY?

41:38.600 --> 41:40.233
OKAY.

41:40.233 --> 41:42.333
SEE, SANDER TEXTED ME.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.867
OH, NO.

41:43.867 --> 41:48.867
SANDER TEXTED,
"DID DAD LOSE POWER?"

41:48.867 --> 41:50.900
ALL RIGHT.
WE NEED TO CALL DAD REAL FAST.

41:55.333 --> 41:57.567
TURN UP THE VOLUME.
IT IS ALL THE WAY UP.

41:57.567 --> 42:00.967
HI, THIS IS GREG.
YOU'VE REACHED MY VOICE MAIL.

42:06.267 --> 42:08.067
HI, THIS IS GREG.
YOU'VE REACHED...

42:08.067 --> 42:09.733
HE ALWAYS ANSWERS THE PHONE.

42:15.500 --> 42:18.067
HI, THIS IS GREG.
YOU'VE REACHED MY VOICE MAIL.

42:18.067 --> 42:20.633
Jazz: KNOWING THAT WE CAN'T GET
IN TOUCH WITH MY DAD,

42:20.633 --> 42:22.100
I REALIZE THAT THIS IS REAL.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.500
THIS IS SERIOUS.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.733
HI, THIS IS GREG.
YOU'VE REACHED MY VOICE MAIL.

42:25.733 --> 42:28.200
Jazz: IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG,
WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO KNOW

42:28.200 --> 42:30.300
ABOUT IT,
AND THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT.
