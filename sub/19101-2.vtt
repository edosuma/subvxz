WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.239
The more we learn about DNA,

00:03.240 --> 00:05.039
the more avenues there are
for gene therapy.

00:05.040 --> 00:08.400
You were very articulate in there,
Professor. Good.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.120
I've never done anything
like that before.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.280
You're married.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.159
So am I.

00:17.160 --> 00:22.359
'Dear X, the only person I can
talk to about you is you.'

00:22.360 --> 00:25.839
Is everything OK? No, it's not
that girl, is it? Rosa?

00:25.840 --> 00:28.959
If you're sleeping with her,
you can tell me, you know. I'm not.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.719
You're beautiful.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.519
What are we doing?

00:32.520 --> 00:34.279
Remind me what it is you do again?

00:34.280 --> 00:35.679
Well, you know, civil service.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.080
Life's mysterious,
which is a good thing.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.279
Hey.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.039
It's a dummy camera.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.480
It's easy to tell the difference if you
know what to look for. My God.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.919
I just left my stuff in my office,
won't take me a sec.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.359
No, come on, George,
don't be silly...

00:57.360 --> 00:58.520
Get off me!

01:01.480 --> 01:04.879
'Fear - that's what makes animals
of us all.'

01:07.360 --> 01:09.839
This programme contains
some strong language

01:09.840 --> 01:13.240
and scenes which some viewers
may find upsetting from the start.

'Dear X...

02:21.960 --> 02:23.760
'..you made me feel special.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.720
'But I'm not special.

takes for your life and

'everything you thought about

'All it takes is one good, hard
slap.'

'Hello?

06:34.800 --> 06:36.320
'Are you playing it cool?

'Yvonne? Hello?

06:42.320 --> 06:44.119
'Is everything OK?'

06:44.120 --> 06:45.240
No.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.360
Hi. Hey.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.240
Jesus.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.400
Did you know him?

07:27.960 --> 07:29.280
Who was he?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.200
George Selway.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.520
He was at the party.

07:38.880 --> 07:43.639
He works at the university
and we do...

07:43.640 --> 07:46.440
external exams, you know,
panels together.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.440
I've known him for about two years.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.079
He couldn't have seemed more
harmless.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.200
You... You haven't got any marks
on...? On your face or...?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.120
He used the flat of his hand.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.000
Like he knew what he was doing.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.640
Have you got bruises anywhere else?

08:24.040 --> 08:26.000
I've got...

08:28.240 --> 08:31.120
I've got finger bruises on my thighs
from when he...

08:38.480 --> 08:40.320
And I've got internal bruising.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.200
And an anal tear.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.160
I didn't fight back.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.039
Listen, do you want me to get some
people to take a statement from you?

09:07.040 --> 09:11.119
No, a team that's used... Used to
handling this sort of thing?

09:11.120 --> 09:13.959
I can't make a statement,
you know I can't.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.880
If they take a swab...

09:18.320 --> 09:19.520
you.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.040
Your semen will be on it.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.559
Jesus.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.680
Your semen will be on it
as well as his.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.439
You could... You could
leave it for a bit.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.479
They don't necessarily need forensic
evidence to bring a prosecution.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.680
It's OK.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.040
I don't want you to.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.640
I just needed to see you.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.080
What about your husband?

09:53.400 --> 09:54.880
Are you going to tell him?

09:57.080 --> 10:00.119
No. Won't it be obvious there's
something wrong though?

10:00.120 --> 10:01.920
I'll just be I'll. I'll...

10:03.160 --> 10:05.240
I'll be ill for a few days.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.199
Well, you're not hot.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.119
It comes and goes.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.559
Took a paracetamol.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.680
How was Sunderland?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.400
Windy.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.519
You don't have to exile
yourself in here, you know.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.560
I might be up in the night -
you never get back to sleep.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.160
Poor old thing.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.680
Are you sure it's not just
the hangover from hell?

10:54.880 --> 10:56.320
Less of the "old".

10:59.720 --> 11:01.240
I'll bring you a cuppa.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.480
Hey!

11:51.480 --> 11:53.079
Anyone in?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.520
Adam?!

11:57.040 --> 11:58.360
Hi, Mum.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.120
What are you doing in my room?

12:07.200 --> 12:09.799
Are you sure you don't want
some toast or something?

12:09.800 --> 12:11.360
I'm good, thanks.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.599
It's OK, then?

12:14.600 --> 12:15.959
Just for a bit?

12:15.960 --> 12:18.000
Adam, love, this is your home.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.399
You can stay as long as you like.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.799
It's just a couple of days,

12:21.800 --> 12:23.400
just to sort some stuff out.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.840
Stuff to do with your music, or...?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.680
Maybe I will make myself some toast.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.199
You've reached
Doctor Carmichael's phone.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.719
I'm out of the office.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.759
For urgent enquiries, please contact
my assistant, Rupa Patel,

12:54.760 --> 12:56.759
on extension 223.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.480
Thanks, bye.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.320
The twisted little fuck.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.840
You did the right thing.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.399
Just cut off communication.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.719
But log it somewhere, yeah?

15:02.720 --> 15:05.279
Any attempt to contact you,
just log it,

15:05.280 --> 15:07.160
just in case. In case of what?

15:08.840 --> 15:10.120
Just in case.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.400
He knows about us.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.759
How?

15:19.760 --> 15:21.000
Don't know.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.160
Maybe he saw me with a phone.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.480
It's as though he smelled it on
me...

15:32.120 --> 15:33.480
the sex.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.240
Apple Tree Yard.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.879
Did you tell him anything about me?

15:45.880 --> 15:47.119
Did you mention my name?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.560
No, of course not.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.960
He doesn't know who you are,
just that you exist.

15:54.640 --> 15:58.200
We were talking,
and I was quite pissed.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.319
God, why was I so pissed?

16:01.320 --> 16:03.399
Look, hey, listen.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.679
None of this is your fault -

16:05.680 --> 16:07.520
none of it.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.039
What did he say?

16:16.040 --> 16:18.479
I was talking about Gary and...

16:18.480 --> 16:21.720
He said, "Is that why
you're fucking someone else?"

16:24.000 --> 16:26.079
And that's when he... It's OK.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.480
Yvonne...

16:28.600 --> 16:29.960
it's going to be OK.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.520
It will.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.720
I'm sorry.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.680
You didn't sign up for this.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.360
I signed up for you.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.398
My signature dish.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.358
Microwaved to perfection,
if I may say.

17:17.359 --> 17:18.719
I did try.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.839
If you're not hungry,
you're not hungry.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.359
It's...

17:29.360 --> 17:31.439
It's girl trouble.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.719
He's talked to you?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.839
A tiny bit. Just that really.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.759
There's this girl.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.719
It's not... whatshername,
from the halfway house? Ellie?

17:40.720 --> 17:42.320
No, I don't think so.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.079
Von, don't go rushing in.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.719
For God's sake,
you think I don't know by now?

17:50.720 --> 17:53.439
I've barely asked him a question.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.439
I know it's hard.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.080
Hard, yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.800
Why don't you go back to bed?

18:02.520 --> 18:04.720
You look like you're at death's
door.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.160
Yeah.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.679
Hi.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.319
Listen, I've thought of something.

19:04.320 --> 19:08.279
I've got someone that you can
talk to about what happened -

19:08.280 --> 19:09.559
an expert.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.439
I'm not sure I want
to talk to anyone.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.320
You wouldn't have to
go to a police station.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.639
It might just give you a
clearer idea of your options.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.240
OK?

19:36.600 --> 19:40.200
Kevin should be able to advise you
on reporting an incident like this.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.360
We went up to his office
to get his stuff.

19:50.400 --> 19:54.319
We were both quite
drunk by that stage.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.759
And he tried to kiss me.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.920
I wasn't really taking it seriously.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.800
And he hit me...

20:04.800 --> 20:07.040
across the face, really hard.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.800
That's all it took.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.240
And then...

20:24.720 --> 20:26.800
It just seemed to go on
for a very long time.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.280
I was too scared to move.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.680
Did he... speak at all?

20:45.240 --> 20:48.040
There were a few... instructions.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.600
He said at one point...

20:56.920 --> 20:58.720
He said, "Give me your mouth."

21:04.520 --> 21:08.160
That's a terrible thing you've
been through. I... I am so sorry.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.559
Now, I'm just going to talk
you through the process of

21:14.560 --> 21:16.399
reporting the rape, yeah?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.879
But I can give you contact details

21:18.880 --> 21:22.199
for counsellors
trained to help women

21:22.200 --> 21:23.879
in a situation such as yourself.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.679
No, I don't think that that...

21:25.680 --> 21:27.879
Well...

21:27.880 --> 21:29.479
Thank you.

21:29.480 --> 21:33.119
Unfortunately, look, I'm not going
to sugar-coat it, Dr Carmichael.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.239
Being drunk will be a
gift for the defence.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.279
You spent the evening with this man.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.719
At a party.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.039
But you see where I'm going.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.039
They'll try and frame it as
a date rape type situation.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.959
The first thing this bloke's
solicitor will do, if he's charged,

21:47.960 --> 21:50.479
is try to get
anything he can on you.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.399
Any... Anything
you've told his client.

21:53.400 --> 21:57.319
Any skeletons in the closet,
as it were.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.599
I see.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.919
And they'll look at everything -

21:59.920 --> 22:03.479
internet history, family,
friends, colleagues -

22:03.480 --> 22:06.159
anything they can get
on your sexual history

22:06.160 --> 22:09.279
that suggests you like it rough.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.599
Any sex tapes or photos.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.240
Well, there aren't any and I don't.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.719
Will they go after my husband?

22:18.720 --> 22:22.079
They will definitely want to know about
the state of your marriage, yeah.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.360
Did you tell your husband
straightaway after the attack?

22:27.440 --> 22:29.920
I... I couldn't. N-no.

22:35.160 --> 22:37.679
What about mental illness?

22:37.680 --> 22:40.479
Depression, anything like that?

22:40.480 --> 22:42.719
Would that come up in court
if I press charges?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.439
If they're trying to discredit me?

22:44.440 --> 22:46.240
Is there anything like that?

22:49.280 --> 22:52.080
When I was eight,
my mum committed suicide.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.279
She had...

22:55.280 --> 22:56.480
depression.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.799
Well, probably exacerbated
by post-natal depression.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.679
She never really recovered.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.159
And my son...

23:07.160 --> 23:10.520
When he was 17, my son was
diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.119
Adam can't be part of this -
he's fragile.

23:16.120 --> 23:20.199
It's very unlikely your son's
illness would be seen as relevant.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.559
But once you've brought a complaint,

23:22.560 --> 23:25.360
it's not up to you to decide
what's used in court and what isn't.

23:26.760 --> 23:29.199
Now, obviously, I can't
tell you what to do.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.879
But what I would say is,
if you do decide to go ahead,

23:31.880 --> 23:35.479
you need to report the
attack to the police - today.

23:35.480 --> 23:39.119
Otherwise, things that make this
really very tricky to prove -

23:39.120 --> 23:42.799
not going to the police, not telling
your husband, no forensic evidence -

23:42.800 --> 23:45.040
they could become... overwhelming.

23:59.440 --> 24:02.200
I was the first person to
qualify the Wedekind experiment.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.280
I'm... I'm sorry,
I've no idea what that means.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.479
When I started protein sequencing,

24:16.480 --> 24:18.039
we were pioneers.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.239
There were no computers

24:20.240 --> 24:24.399
and my team named genes
as they were discovered,

24:24.400 --> 24:28.839
and those are names that are going to
be used for as long as science exists.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.039
But if I...

24:30.040 --> 24:32.519
If I take this to court...

24:32.520 --> 24:34.519
God, it's a big if, isn't it?

24:34.520 --> 24:37.079
Because it seems like
it's all going to come out,

24:37.080 --> 24:38.239
what we've been up to.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.439
Well, we... We've been
really careful, you know. Yeah.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.719
Yeah, dummy camera.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.800
So, OK, it goes to court and...

24:47.880 --> 24:50.760
the first thing anyone's going
to know about me is that I was...

24:52.960 --> 24:54.760
That George Selway attacked me.

24:56.680 --> 25:02.200
Even if he goes to prison,
that's who I am now - victim.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.280
The world can be such a shitty
place.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.160
I thought you thought life's a boon.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.279
Yeah.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.840
It can be.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.840
I'm sorry about your son.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.640
Must have been really hard.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.359
I'm really sorry, but I...

25:38.360 --> 25:41.759
I don't think I can ever
imagine having sex again.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.240
I, I wasn't...
No, no, I know. I know, but...

25:46.840 --> 25:49.040
Perhaps the reason for this wasn't
it.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.320
What's the point?

25:54.040 --> 25:55.480
You've got your wife.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.920
I've got Gary.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.360
And now this.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.239
It's impossible.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.640
No such word.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.439
You were the first
person to qualify the...

26:10.440 --> 26:13.080
The Wedekind experiment.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.160
I'm not sure that we
should be in touch again.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.560
I think it's wrong for both of us.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.960
I'm really sorry.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.959
Dear X,

26:51.960 --> 26:55.720
whatever it was between us, it was
never meant to bear much reality.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.639
That was the point, wasn't it?

26:59.640 --> 27:01.679
No real life.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.640
No feelings, no mess.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.999
But a steam might have helped,
you know?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.479
Have you been to the doctor?

27:11.480 --> 27:13.679
There's no point, is there,
for a virus?

27:13.680 --> 27:15.399
Yeah.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.879
Yeah, it'll just
be a couple of weeks.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.279
Anyway, you and Chris.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.640
How come we always talk about me
and we never talk about you?

27:25.240 --> 27:27.879
OK, it was the sex.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.959
It was great in the beginning.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.999
Well, no, it wasn't.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.919
It wasn't the best ever,
but it showed promise.

27:36.920 --> 27:41.799
And then I realised
it was like a script...

27:41.800 --> 27:43.559
like porn.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.239
Like rough stuff.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.560
Anyway, it wasn't making me
feel good about myself, so...

27:50.560 --> 27:53.159
Plus, I spotted a pair
of Crocs in his wardrobe

27:53.160 --> 27:56.439
and I realised that I had to
split up with him before the summer.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.840
Sooz!

28:00.400 --> 28:03.799
You'd think I'd have
learned my lesson after Jay.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.399
Me and men...

28:05.400 --> 28:07.159
Hey.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.560
You're fantastic.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.359
There are some truly
awful men out there.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.679
I know, I've dated most of them!

28:16.680 --> 28:19.360
No, really monstrous.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.839
Anyway...

28:22.840 --> 28:26.400
Is he treating you all right?

28:28.480 --> 28:30.639
Babe.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.080
I'm sorry, I'm...

28:34.040 --> 28:35.359
miserable.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.879
Hey.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.039
Fuck him.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.520
Fuck him... and his Crocs.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.480
His fucking Crocs!

28:50.440 --> 28:53.799
Hey. Nice evening?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.319
Yeah.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.679
You still look wobbly, love.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.559
Are you sure you're feeling well
enough to go back to work?

28:59.560 --> 29:01.679
Can't stay away forever.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.840
I'm going up.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.320
What?

29:06.320 --> 29:07.600
Mum.

29:23.440 --> 29:29.719
Carrie says even smelling coffee at
the moment makes her want to puke.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.599
Hope the baby's OK.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.319
Everything seems fine so far.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.239
Most pregnancies are problem-free,
especially at Carrie's age.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.920
The voice of reason.

29:40.840 --> 29:44.799
It's the closest I'll come, I
suppose, to babies - being an uncle.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.999
You don't know that.
There's plenty of time.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.559
Insight into my condition.

29:48.560 --> 29:51.320
All the shrinks say I'm
good on that, don't they?

29:52.600 --> 29:54.999
It'd be a very bad idea
for me to pass on my genes.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.560
There's no evidence that it's
genetic.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.839
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.720
There's no danger of me passing
on my genes - no-one wants them.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.880
Dad says there's a girl
you're interested in.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.480
She's... so lovely, Mum.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.680
Kind and funny.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.800
She can even sing...

30:30.400 --> 30:31.720
like an angel.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.079
How stupid was I to ever
think she'd want to hook up

30:38.080 --> 30:39.240
with a fuck-up like me?

30:40.360 --> 30:41.999
There'll be someone for you.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.520
You don't know that!

30:45.720 --> 30:48.879
It's very easy for us to tell
ourselves stories about people,

30:48.880 --> 30:50.240
that they're perfect...

30:51.280 --> 30:52.600
but no-one is.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.920
Not even you?

31:10.520 --> 31:13.719
You've never talked about your work-

31:13.720 --> 31:16.919
Official Secrets Act and all that -

31:16.920 --> 31:20.719
but you've always encouraged
me to talk about mine.

31:20.720 --> 31:24.479
Enjoying the pleasure
I take in it, I think.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.920
Work's always been my refuge.

32:01.440 --> 32:05.079
There are no more refuges for me.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.640
No places of safety.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.720
Bracing yourself for
Marcia's killer martinis?

32:19.760 --> 32:22.919
Two parts vodka,
one part antifreeze.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.799
It's nothing to do with football.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.159
It's what these boys think
they can get away with.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.119
You're not gluten-free, I hope?

32:29.120 --> 32:33.039
It looks like rice -
it's orzo. Pasta.

32:33.040 --> 32:36.319
I mean, oral sex -
that's what I don't get.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.199
How can you force someone
to give you a blowjob?

32:39.200 --> 32:41.319
I mean, wouldn't you
just bite it off?

32:41.320 --> 32:43.199
It's bad enough men
peddling crap like that

32:43.200 --> 32:45.039
without women making it worse.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.959
I'm just saying.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.559
Logistically, I'm surprised
it doesn't happen.

32:49.560 --> 32:50.839
They're terrified.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.119
This girl wasn't.
She went back to his hotel room.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.479
I mean, what was she expecting?

32:54.480 --> 32:57.079
I don't know. Maybe that
he'd show some consideration?

32:57.080 --> 32:59.359
She'd be allowed
to change her mind?

32:59.360 --> 33:01.319
Maybe she did say yes to sex,

33:01.320 --> 33:05.279
but she didn't mean yes to him
assaulting her in every orifice,

33:05.280 --> 33:06.759
roughing her up while he did it,

33:06.760 --> 33:08.719
and his mates filming
it on their phones.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.239
If these girls are going to get so blind drunk
they can't think straight, inevitably...

33:12.240 --> 33:14.959
Well, maybe you're just too fucking
complacent to think straight!

33:14.960 --> 33:18.319
Yvonne.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.400
Er, your baby's really crying.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.559
I'm sorry. You're lovely

33:25.560 --> 33:28.839
and your house is lovely,
and you give lovely dinner parties,

33:28.840 --> 33:31.039
and everything in
your world is lovely,

33:31.040 --> 33:33.759
so you don't really have the
imagination to see what it's like

33:33.760 --> 33:34.999
when bad things happen,

33:35.000 --> 33:38.919
just randomly, great torrents of
shit descending on ordinary people.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.799
So you're looking
for who's to blame

33:40.800 --> 33:43.239
cos that's less scary
than facing up to the fact

33:43.240 --> 33:46.599
that awful things can happen,
even to someone as lovely as you,

33:46.600 --> 33:48.080
really awful things.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.480
Is this my fault?

34:17.120 --> 34:18.520
You're...

34:20.440 --> 34:22.520
You haven't been right for weeks.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.399
I'm sorry...

34:30.400 --> 34:32.120
about the business with Rosa.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.478
It's nonsense.

34:37.480 --> 34:38.880
No, it's not that.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.320
Really?

34:45.679 --> 34:47.040
Well, what, then?

34:53.920 --> 34:55.880
I'm thinking of leaving the
Beaufort.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.839
Why?

35:00.840 --> 35:02.560
I'm not enjoying it anymore.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.959
It's really, really getting me down.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.639
Since when? You never said.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.119
I'll make up the money.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.079
I've got consultancy work
coming out of my ears.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.519
It's not the money.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.040
There's nowhere like it.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.319
Is it something specific?

35:18.320 --> 35:20.039
No, no.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.400
It's just...

35:24.120 --> 35:26.279
It's just been
building up generally

35:26.280 --> 35:29.240
and it exploded all
over Marcia tonight.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.280
I'll ring her in the
morning to apologise.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.119
I'm serious, Liz. I told you
last week - no leaving do.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.959
Let's have a drink when the dust has
settled. I'll e-mail you some dates.

35:45.960 --> 35:48.399
I'll get it!

35:48.400 --> 35:50.840
I've got to go. All right, bye.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.520
Secret admirer.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.000
Mum? Are you OK?

36:17.600 --> 36:19.040
Mum!

36:37.360 --> 36:39.519
So, the Beaufort.

36:39.520 --> 36:43.039
Dad seems a bit confused
about you leaving.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.399
He's talked to you about it?

36:44.400 --> 36:46.079
In his way.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.239
He said something
about your time of life,

36:48.240 --> 36:51.519
as though resigning was
like a symptom of menopause.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.839
Is it?

36:52.840 --> 36:55.039
It just doesn't suit me anymore.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.239
I needed a change of direction.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.919
You're not going off
trekking in Nepal, are you?

36:59.920 --> 37:02.919
Or start having a wild affair?

37:02.920 --> 37:05.439
Cos, you know, timing...

37:05.440 --> 37:08.679
I just really like working from home
and your dad's busier than ever,

37:08.680 --> 37:10.759
so I can afford to take my
foot off the pedal a bit.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.280
Yeah, this conference
in Estonia - that's random!

37:20.400 --> 37:22.919
Mum...

37:22.920 --> 37:25.240
You're not depressed, are you?

37:26.400 --> 37:28.040
No. No, of course not.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.959
Dear X,

37:41.960 --> 37:44.599
I loved you touching me.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.920
Everywhere.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.720
I can't imagine that ever again.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.399
But I do still want you,

37:54.400 --> 37:56.439
just you.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.760
And it's terrible
because it keeps me feeling.

38:02.040 --> 38:06.119
And the only way I can see to
get through this is to be numb.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.160
See ya!

38:15.120 --> 38:17.120
I think about you every single day.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.600
Most minutes of each day,
if I'm honest.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.199
This is what I cling to.

38:26.200 --> 38:30.200
While you're off saving the
free world, you think of me...

38:31.800 --> 38:33.679
because you saw me,

38:33.680 --> 38:35.160
I really think you did...

38:36.920 --> 38:38.799
and I saw you,

38:38.800 --> 38:41.560
and that's a rare thing
between two human beings.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.920
I'm off, Von!

41:09.880 --> 41:11.440
Well, knock 'em dead.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.840
Hello, Estonia!

41:30.720 --> 41:32.320
Gary!

41:35.600 --> 41:38.519
I thought he was leaving
at the end of the month.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.959
He's had a good run.
He stayed longer than we thought.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.039
Yeah, but not to say anything.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.879
He mentioned to me last night
he was thinking of heading back.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.439
I presumed he meant
at the end of the week.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.840
What did I do?

41:52.720 --> 41:54.999
Why does he find it
so easy to talk to you

41:55.000 --> 41:57.759
and bloody impossible to talk to me?

41:57.760 --> 42:00.320
Hey, Adam loves you to bits,
you know he does.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.440
There's a thin line and all that.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.039
I have to go to the airport.

42:08.040 --> 42:09.719
I hope it's fun.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.160
"Fun"!

44:35.680 --> 44:38.159
Hi. Um...

44:38.160 --> 44:39.839
I didn't think you
were going to pick up.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.599
I was just going to leave a message.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.119
Has something happened?
Are you all right?

44:44.120 --> 44:45.759
It's George Selway -

44:45.760 --> 44:48.439
he won't leave me alone.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.639
He must have followed
me to the hairdressers

44:50.640 --> 44:53.679
and he just turned up in
the shop near my house.

44:53.680 --> 44:56.439
Wait, hang on - are you
saying he's stalking you now?

44:56.440 --> 44:58.159
I don't know, but...

44:58.160 --> 45:01.039
He's been texting me and...

45:01.040 --> 45:03.759
A few weeks ago, he sent me flowers.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.800
I'm really sorry,
I'm just blithering.

45:07.120 --> 45:10.119
I'm really, really scared.
No, of course.

45:10.120 --> 45:12.679
Look, all right. Look, I'm
going to give you an address

45:12.680 --> 45:14.319
and I need you to
listen very carefully.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.479
I don't have a pen.
I haven't got a pen.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.999
No, d-don't write it down,
you've got a good memory.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.679
Ready? It's 12 Merthyr Court.

45:22.680 --> 45:27.279
That's M-E-R-T-H-Y-R,
like the place in Wales.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.519
Chamberland Road.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.919
Now, repeat that back to me.

45:32.920 --> 45:37.359
12 Merthyr Court,
Chamberland Road, SE11. Good.

45:37.360 --> 45:41.399
I'll see you there tomorrow,
as close to 2pm as I can make it.

45:41.400 --> 45:44.279
We can talk properly there,
all right?

45:44.280 --> 45:48.159
Look, just don't put it in
your phones, not even into maps, OK?

45:48.160 --> 45:50.199
OK. Thank you.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.439
Right, and are you going
to be all right until then?

45:52.440 --> 45:53.919
I'm not taking any risks.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.679
Good. Don't.
I'll see you tomorrow.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.760
I'm really glad you called, Yvonne.

46:00.280 --> 46:01.600
Say my name again.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.759
Yvonne.

46:04.760 --> 46:08.479
We'll see each other tomorrow,
all right? We'll be together.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.199
OK?

46:10.200 --> 46:12.040
I've got to go.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.000
It's...

47:44.280 --> 47:47.479
We're not talking boutique hotel,
obviously.

47:47.480 --> 47:49.439
It's OK.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.799
It's safe.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.600
A safe house.

47:56.880 --> 47:59.760
I know you're not allowed
to talk about what you do.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.320
Do...? Do you want
to take your coat off?

49:28.080 --> 49:29.680
I'm not asleep.

49:31.440 --> 49:33.200
But my arm is.

49:45.920 --> 49:47.720
So what do you want to do?

49:51.640 --> 49:53.560
About Selway?

49:55.440 --> 49:58.039
Can't you warn him off for me?

49:58.040 --> 50:00.640
Nothing would give
me greater pleasure.

50:02.840 --> 50:04.440
Well, almost nothing.

50:12.200 --> 50:15.279
Don't tell me you wouldn't
like to put the wind right up

50:15.280 --> 50:17.759
that pathetic piece of shit.

50:17.760 --> 50:19.320
Yeah, I would.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.840
I want him to crap
himself with fear.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.480
I want him to feel...

50:29.000 --> 50:31.560
half as terrified
as he made he feel.

50:33.600 --> 50:37.719
I'm not really the one
for that job, am I?

50:37.720 --> 50:39.760
As far as I'm concerned, I...

50:40.960 --> 50:43.439
I think he thinks he
can do whatever he likes.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.280
So it has to change.

50:47.600 --> 50:50.840
I suppose you know people.

50:52.320 --> 50:53.560
Yeah.

50:55.880 --> 50:58.040
I'd like to see his face.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.920
Wouldn't you?

51:32.200 --> 51:33.520
Early?

51:35.080 --> 51:36.440
Yeah.

51:37.520 --> 51:38.840
Got stuff to do.

51:44.120 --> 51:45.920
How was it all? Estonia?

51:48.080 --> 51:49.679
Von.

51:49.680 --> 51:51.000
Von.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.520
Von!

52:00.040 --> 52:01.440
You should know...

52:05.280 --> 52:07.559
The thing is, the conference...

52:07.560 --> 52:10.080
Rosa came with me to the conference.

52:17.480 --> 52:19.320
So you are sleeping with her.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.480
I wasn't before. I didn't lie.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.080
We never have sex.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.919
So it's my fault?

52:34.920 --> 52:37.159
I'm not trying to blame you.

52:37.160 --> 52:38.880
It's an explanation.

52:42.480 --> 52:45.200
Pretty standard midlife
crisis stuff, I'm afraid.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.720
Sure.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.600
Yvonne!

53:00.640 --> 53:03.319
The recycling place gets
mobbed on a Saturday,

53:03.320 --> 53:05.919
so we can talk about
it when I get back.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.360
You don't need me!

53:10.280 --> 53:11.800
Is that what you think?

54:46.360 --> 54:49.279
What are you going to say to him?

54:49.280 --> 54:51.160
I thought I'd freestyle it.

56:17.840 --> 56:20.640
Is there any such thing
as a point of no return?

56:22.760 --> 56:24.999
I used to think there wasn't.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.799
Would the defendant please stand?

56:27.800 --> 56:30.199
And then I met you.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.520
Fucking bitch!

56:33.000 --> 56:34.999
You deserve everything you get!

56:35.000 --> 56:38.879
Are you happy now
you've destroyed our life?

56:38.880 --> 56:41.560
You bitch! You evil bitch!
