WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.044
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.579
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.580
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.316
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.118
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:17.151 --> 00:20.054
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.422
Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:21.455 --> 00:23.191
Borrow a pen?

00:24.325 --> 00:25.426
There.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.261
You two know
each other?

00:27.295 --> 00:30.064
Not really.
He goes to my school.

00:30.098 --> 00:33.267
I'm gonna win
you over, Rita Shaw.
You just wait and see.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.206
You're cute.
And I'm India.

00:38.239 --> 00:41.475
I'm actually
looking for Jane.
Have you seen her?

00:41.509 --> 00:44.245
Jane, Jane, Jane...
What's so great about Jane?

00:47.215 --> 00:52.120
You're looking at the new
creative director
of Donovan Decker.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.621
There are big things
ahead for us, Jane Quimby.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.257
Big things.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.193
What?!

00:59.227 --> 01:01.229
You're not gonna believe
where I'm standing right now.

01:01.262 --> 01:01.629
(CHUCKLING)

01:12.273 --> 01:13.507
JANE: Image is everything.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.544
What we wear tells
people who we are,

01:16.577 --> 01:20.148
who we want to be.

01:20.181 --> 01:20.681
Some people work hard
to project a certain image,

01:23.184 --> 01:27.255
while for others,
image seems effortless.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.123
But no matter
how hard you try,

01:29.157 --> 01:31.091
you can't always control
the way that others see you.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.496
But at the end of the day,

01:35.529 --> 01:38.098
who you are is totally
and completely up to you.

01:43.404 --> 01:47.675
* I've my heart where
my head should be

01:47.708 --> 01:51.212
* Light up the rest of me

01:51.245 --> 01:55.149
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

01:55.183 --> 01:57.151
* Through the stops,
the starts

01:57.185 --> 01:59.320
* And life is a work of art

02:02.490 --> 02:03.691
Eighteen and under is
a billion-dollar industry

02:03.724 --> 02:07.461
that we have yet
to fully tap into here
at Donovan Decker.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.697
Until now.

02:09.730 --> 02:13.301
From Travel Bright,
to Optical Future,

02:13.601 --> 02:16.437
to Romantic Escape.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.572
These are trends that
other designers
are jumping on.

02:18.606 --> 02:22.310
But, after extensive field
research and detailed trend
forecasting reports,

02:22.343 --> 02:25.713
I can confidently
tell you that I know

02:25.746 --> 02:28.482
what advanced contemporaries
want before they do.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.718
And that's why my new
accessories line for spring
is the next big thing.

02:30.751 --> 02:35.923
And that thing is neon.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.258
I'm not talking
'80s acid neon.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.361
I'm talking neo-African neon.

02:41.329 --> 02:41.762
(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)

02:44.565 --> 02:46.734
(SNICKERS)

02:46.767 --> 02:48.168
Do you have something
to add, Jane?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.238
I just...

02:52.373 --> 02:53.374
Go on.

02:53.707 --> 02:57.278
Nothing. I'm sorry.
I'm good.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.413
No, tell us what
you think, Jane.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.516
Yes, Jane. Tell us.

03:02.550 --> 03:07.388
I'm just not sure
real teenagers jump
on trends like that.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.457
Research shows us they do.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.459
Trend forecasting is a
touchstone of the fashion
business, Jane.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.694
Precisely. Thank you.

03:13.727 --> 03:17.665
Right. Look, maybe young
people are interested in
what's new, but...

03:19.567 --> 03:22.570
Go on, Jane.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.373
I just don't think they
want to feel like trends,

03:25.406 --> 03:28.242
trends somebody else
decided, define them.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.578
They want to
define themselves.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.980
Interesting point, Jane.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.382
It is?

03:34.415 --> 03:40.621
Well, seeing as Jane
seems to be such an expert
on what teens want,

03:40.654 --> 03:42.523
maybe Jane should be
doing our research.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.557
(ALL CHUCKLING)

03:47.728 --> 03:48.496
Distance
to the pin?

03:48.529 --> 03:51.365
You're about 147
yards to the pin.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.500
I'd go with
the seven iron.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.469
Give me the eight.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.721
Little short. You know,
maybe next time you...

04:22.330 --> 04:23.364
You might not be able
to tell by the looks
of me, Judge,

04:23.397 --> 04:25.733
but I actually do know
a thing or two about golf.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.436
I could help you.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.437
I'm gonna be straight
with you, son.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.574
The way you look
sends a message.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.845
A message about who you are.
Who you want to be.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.682
I see kids with that look
of yours in my courtroom
every day.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.753
And that look...

04:45.786 --> 04:49.590
Let's just say the message it
sends is not a positive one.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.469
Oh, please.
Why do you care
what he thinks?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.837
Well, sure sounds like you do.

05:03.871 --> 05:08.108
No. It's just...
I don't know, Janey.
Maybe he's got a point.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.412
You know? Maybe if
I looked different,

05:12.580 --> 05:14.081
dressed different...

05:14.114 --> 05:17.485
Maybe people like the Judge
would treat me a little
differently. That's all.

05:17.518 --> 05:21.389
People like the Judge,
they don't get you.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.923
And they don't
deserve you, Billy.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.829
Look, I gotta go.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.899
But promise me you won't
change who you are, okay?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.634
Okay.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.369
I promise.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.644
You made a fool
of me in there.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.748
No. I didn't. You asked
me what I thought,
and so I answered.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.683
Yeah, well, in future,
when it comes to my line,

05:49.717 --> 05:52.753
you don't think.
You don't speak.
You don't even breathe.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.455
That's a little extreme.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.656
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right. It is.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.390
Do you have any idea
what's at stake
for me with this?

05:56.424 --> 05:58.926
You can't just
rBoth of you.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.694
In my office. Now.

06:06.534 --> 06:10.604
So, Jane, about
your little outburst
this morning.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.705
That's exactly
what I was talking
to her about.

06:11.739 --> 06:11.972
She needs
to learn to...

06:14.842 --> 06:16.910
I'm really,
really sorry.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.579
I shouldn't have
said anything.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.548
Actually,
I'm glad you did.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.450
So, tell me what
you thought of
India's presentation.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.887
I thought
it was great.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.959
It was insightful
and informative...

06:33.527 --> 06:36.597
Okay, fine. It was...
Sort of...

06:37.731 --> 06:38.932
I think what Jane
is trying to say is

06:38.966 --> 06:43.437
she's not so sure
the whole neon
accessory idea of yours

06:43.471 --> 06:44.872
is going to be
the next hot thing.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.474
Actually, I...

06:46.507 --> 06:47.808
And I agree with her.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.578
Your thoughts on
the line are interesting

06:50.611 --> 06:52.580
but they're not
fully-formed.

06:52.613 --> 06:56.650
However, you did have
one particularly impressive
idea this morning.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.018
And that idea
was Jane.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.756
JMe??

07:02.790 --> 07:03.591
Yes. You were
right, India.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.560
Jane should be
doing our research.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.730
You're an advanced
contemporary, am I right?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.232
Young, stylish,
fresh out of school?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.867
Very fresh. Just
like it was yesterday.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.537
Gray, I...

07:16.570 --> 07:18.672
You need to go back
to the drawing board.

07:18.706 --> 07:21.542
And I need a trend report
from you on today's youth.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.712
Real, raw, publicly-educated
high school students.

07:24.745 --> 07:28.582
I want to know what they're
wearing, what they're feeling
and what influences them.

07:28.616 --> 07:31.018
I want it all.
Can you do that, Jane?

07:32.052 --> 07:34.021
Um, sure.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.957
And India, I really
admire your effort.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.727
Your perseverance
is inspiring.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.830
And as far as
the line goes...

07:42.863 --> 07:45.065
Well, we'll just keep
trying, won't we?

07:48.902 --> 07:51.038
You can go now.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.072
Right.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.543
Good luck, Jane.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.616
This new position of mine?
Creative director?

08:02.650 --> 08:05.586
I like it. A lot.
And I intend on keeping it.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.522
All eyes
are on us, Jane.

08:08.556 --> 08:13.661
And now, more than
ever, your actions are
a reflection of me.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.962
I won't let you down.

08:14.995 --> 08:15.829
I certainly hope not.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.699
You can go now.
My next meeting is here.

08:22.670 --> 08:22.936
Christos.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.638
Hello.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.610
CHello!.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.945
I hope you found my
vintage gold lame Halston!

08:31.979 --> 08:33.914
We didn't just
find it, Gray.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.983
We have it
right here.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.786
Oh, and Jane.
I need that report
by Friday.

08:38.819 --> 08:39.653
(GRUNTS MEEKLY)

08:40.754 --> 08:41.755
(SIGHS)

08:43.591 --> 08:46.694
Wait, Friday?
As in this Friday?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.295
Yes. I am
desperate, Carter.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.864
Uh, maybe I can
help you out.

08:55.669 --> 09:00.107
But I am really busy.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.643
You're busy with what?

09:02.676 --> 09:03.143
Um...

09:05.012 --> 09:06.647
Uh...

09:06.680 --> 09:07.581
I have to go.

09:08.982 --> 09:09.983
(SCOFFS) Coward.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.723
Hey.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.124
How can I help you today?

09:17.157 --> 09:20.060
Oh, you can't help me.
I'm just hanging out.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.730
Wanted to say hey.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.131
Hey.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.066
Checking out
your sketches.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.369
They're really good.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.139
Okay, fine, I need
to know what a trend
report looks like.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.375
You just sat through one.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.711
Right.
Let me rephrase
the question.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.881
What does a good
trend report look like?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.883
(CHUCKLES) Ouch.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.653
Oh, no, I didn't
mean it like that,
I just mean...

09:45.686 --> 09:49.623
You know, Gray is the new
creative director and
she's counting on me.

09:49.657 --> 09:54.728
Or, well, she's expecting me
to do this and to do it well
and also by Friday.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.797
So that brings me back
to my original question,

09:56.830 --> 09:58.598
what does a trend
report look like?

10:00.834 --> 10:03.003
Well, it can look
like anything, really.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.639
Oh, great, yeah,
that's super helpful.
Thank you.

10:05.673 --> 10:09.142
You just need to find
something that helps
communicate the message.

10:10.177 --> 10:10.911
What message?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.046
Your message.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.081
Uh-huh?

10:15.548 --> 10:18.018
Which, from this particular
angle, looks like it
should be surrender.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.387
I know, right?

10:20.420 --> 10:22.122
God, she's been glaring
at me like that all day.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.623
She even yelled at me.

10:23.657 --> 10:29.196
Well, in her defense,
you did publicly humiliate
her in front of Gray.

10:29.229 --> 10:33.166
She asked me a question
and so I answered.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.234
Which is what we
are supposed to do.

10:35.903 --> 10:36.904
Isn't it?

10:37.738 --> 10:38.238
Not even close.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.674
(SIGHS)

10:40.708 --> 10:41.875
Of course it isn't.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.812
There's a certain etiquette.

10:44.845 --> 10:48.749
Right? As designers,
we put ourselves out there
creatively every day

10:48.782 --> 10:51.785
and in exchange we try
not to hang each other
out to dry.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.688
At the very least,
not in front of
the creative director.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.857
Which is exactly
what I did to India.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.226
You should just apologize.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.161
Apologize?

11:01.194 --> 11:03.964
To India?
After everything
she's done to me?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.433
No.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.935
Have it your way, Jane.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.036
But I think it would
be a wise idea.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.103
Why?

11:10.137 --> 11:12.472
Self-preservation?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.673
I'm not really
following.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.011
The problem with taking
on someone like India

11:18.045 --> 11:20.280
is that you're taking
on someone like India.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.084
You put yourself
in the tiger's cage,

11:25.753 --> 11:26.754
expect to get bitten.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.866
(SIGHING)
You ready?

11:38.899 --> 11:39.867
Almost.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.102
What're you doing?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.270
I'm eating my cereal.

11:44.905 --> 11:45.438
Ben, come on.
I'm in a rush.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.239
Just give it a minute.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.507
Give what a minute?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.177
The cereal.
I have to wait for
the milk to do its thing.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.512
I really don't have
time for this.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.781
I have to do a project
for Gray today

11:53.814 --> 11:55.282
and India hates me
now more than ever
because I ruined her

11:55.315 --> 11:58.819
trend report neo-neony
thingy and I really can't
fail because Gray said

11:58.852 --> 11:59.519
my actions reflect on her
now more than ever

11:59.552 --> 12:01.221
so I have to do
a good job.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.991
And I need permission
from Miss Shaw to do it.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.794
Okay. I followed
about a third of that
at best,

12:06.827 --> 12:08.295
but I think I can
help you out. I'll talk
to Miss Shaw for you.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.131
Yeah, that's really
not necessary.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.699
Me and Rita,
we see eye to eye.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.736
That's great, but can you
just eat your cereal
as is like a normal person?

12:19.072 --> 12:19.606
Okay.

12:19.639 --> 12:22.843
This is important to me.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.177
Okay, great.
Let's go.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.046
(SIGHS)

12:27.314 --> 12:30.050
Are you wearing that?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.919
Yeah. Awesome, right?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.153
It's great.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.888
Hey, where's
your sidekick today?

12:34.922 --> 12:36.790
Oh, Billy's meeting
me at school.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.092
And you're sure you
don't want me to talk
to Miss Shaw for you?

12:39.126 --> 12:40.360
Nah, she likes me.
I'm sure she'll say yes.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.533
No.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.901
No?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.803
I don't think
it's a good idea.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.271
Please, Miss Shaw.
I just wanna interview
a few students.

12:51.304 --> 12:56.109
Do you know what
happened the last time I let
a student do an interview?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.846
Well, you don't want to know.
It ended up on YouTube and...

12:58.879 --> 13:01.081
Let's just say
it didn't go so well.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.952
Well, this is strictly
for my internship.
I promise.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.187
It's just me, a few
volunteers and a video
camera from the AV club.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.990
This is a chance for
me to prove myself.

13:11.024 --> 13:14.061
To prove that,
I don't know...

13:14.094 --> 13:17.831
That being a teenager
is about more than being
part of the status quo.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.099
You get that, right?

13:21.368 --> 13:23.203
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

13:26.373 --> 13:28.842
Yes, India?

13:28.876 --> 13:30.143
Just checking in,
see how things are
going on your end.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.913
Oh, it's going...

13:32.946 --> 13:37.117
Great! I'm completely
backlogged with
the youth market

13:37.150 --> 13:37.417
wanting to talk
to me.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.622
So, how's your
new collection
coming along?

13:42.655 --> 13:47.260
Great. The ideas
are really flowing.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.128
Any insights from
the teen market?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.230
Too many to count.

13:50.263 --> 13:50.330
Oh! Such as?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.103
You know what?
I'm really busy right now.

13:56.136 --> 13:56.403
I'm gonna have to go.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.015
Need some help
with that, Quimby?

14:08.048 --> 14:10.884
Oh, hi. I'd love
some help.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.252
Do you know anything
about video cameras?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.187
Yeah, sure.

14:14.221 --> 14:18.391
Just select the tint
aperture of the focus
shutter speed.

14:18.425 --> 14:22.329
And then you
set the contrast
and the exposure.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.830
And then...

14:23.863 --> 14:27.134
You're just saying random
words associated with
photography, aren't you?

14:27.167 --> 14:27.700
Pretty much.

14:27.734 --> 14:28.435
It's very convincing.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.071
Hey, Fadden.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.072
One out. Runners on first
and second. What do you do?

14:32.105 --> 14:34.174
What?

14:34.207 --> 14:34.474
You know what
to do, right?

14:36.409 --> 14:38.211
Yep, I think I got it.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.247
What did that mean?

14:40.280 --> 14:41.982
Absolutely no idea.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.117
(LAUGHS)

14:44.151 --> 14:45.352
You know, your
brother's sort of...

14:45.385 --> 14:46.954
Enthusiastic? I know.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.990
I was g(SIGHS)y weird.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.959
You know, you two
are a lot alike.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.194
See you later, Jane.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.263
See you later.

14:56.296 --> 14:56.496
"Weird"?

15:02.135 --> 15:03.370
Okay, seriously,
Ben...

15:03.403 --> 15:04.337
Can you please
stop acting so weird?

15:04.371 --> 15:07.040
How am I being weird?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.275
Well. Hand signals
in the hallway,
for starters.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.944
Assistant baseball coach.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.946
Same thing. We have
a big game coming
up this weekend.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.948
I was testing him.
Keeping him on his toes.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.083
Why can't you
just test him
at practice?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.684
He'd be expecting that.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.086
Fashion interviews today?

15:20.988 --> 15:23.957
Okay. Well, can you
please just try not
to act so weird?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.360
Your actions, Ben...

15:27.394 --> 15:29.162
Your actions are
a reflection on me.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.399
And that vest
isn't helping.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.203
Are you embarrassed by me?

15:36.236 --> 15:39.439
No, of course not.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.509
I just... I don't want
people thinking I'm
weird when I'm not.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.977
Okay?

15:44.011 --> 15:47.981
Hey, guys! Would you
come talk to me about
your personal style today?

15:48.015 --> 15:50.250
Yeah, I don't think so.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.551
Such a weirdo.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.525
You're not weird.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.360
See that guy?
He's weird.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.366
Steve's not weird.
He's an individual.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.168
He's just trying
to figure out who he is.

16:08.201 --> 16:12.072
Which is exactly what
my project is about.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.774
If I can get anyone
to talk to me.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.444
I really want to show
Gray and India and
everyone at Donovan Decker

16:17.477 --> 16:21.348
that being a teenager
is about discovering
who you are,

16:21.381 --> 16:24.151
not just changing who
you are to fit some
ridiculous mold.

16:43.336 --> 16:43.603
You sure about that?

17:01.421 --> 17:04.191
Please tell me you
ran out of hair gel.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.293
I'm just trying
something new, Jane.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.594
Billy, come on.
This isn't you.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.462
Says the girl with
the double life.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.230
That's different.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.599
Okay. Whatever.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.334
I just don't think...

17:14.367 --> 17:16.836
You know, Jane,
I always support you.
No matter what.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.406
All your crazy running around
between two worlds,

17:19.439 --> 17:20.373
I'm the one that's
always there for you.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.610
Can't you just
be there for me?
Just once?

17:29.182 --> 17:31.451
I'm telling you,
you look just
like him.

17:31.484 --> 17:32.152
It is him, Harper.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.622
I know.
It's just so crazy.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.357
You look like
a completely
different person.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.226
I'm the same guy.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.328
Okay, but who
do you think

17:41.361 --> 17:43.596
would win in a fight
between this you
and the other you?

17:43.630 --> 17:44.864
(LAUGHS) I'm pretty sure
it would be a tie.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.467
No. The other you.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.237
Even though this you
is way hotter.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.639
Did you just call
my boyfriend hot
right in front of me?

17:52.672 --> 17:55.142
No. I said "way hot."

17:55.175 --> 17:57.177
And you'd better
get used to it,

17:57.210 --> 17:57.410
because every girl
in school's gonna
want him now.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.182
Seriously.
You look just like him.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.119
You're enjoying this.

18:06.153 --> 18:06.886
(CHUCKLES)
Maybe a little.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.222
A little too much.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.160
Billy, is this
about my dad?

18:13.193 --> 18:14.261
What he said the other day?
Because if it is...

18:14.294 --> 18:18.531
No. Yes.
Maybe a little.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.634
It's just that
your dad sort of made
a good point is all.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.336
I don't know,
I guess I'm just

18:23.370 --> 18:25.572
trying a new message?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.408
So, what do you think?

18:28.441 --> 18:31.144
If you like it,
I like it.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.413
NICK: Hey, Billy!

18:37.684 --> 18:39.552
Go.

18:43.390 --> 18:47.194
It's like 300 yards
or something like that.
It's a talent.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.162
Hey, man, I was just
telling these guys about
that swing of yours.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.397
Oh, yeah, it's
nothing, man.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.532
No, no, it's amazing.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.467
You should check out this guy
at the driving range.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.336
We could use
a swing like that
on our team, man.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.205
All right.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.541
So, what do you think,
can you hit 300 yards?

19:02.375 --> 19:03.410
Yeah.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.744
BOY: Three hundy, for real?

19:09.616 --> 19:13.553
It's been three days
and the aliens seem
to be getting smarter.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.388
What are you doing?

19:15.422 --> 19:17.257
You told me to
turn on the camera.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.192
I know. That means
push a button.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.228
You okay? You
seem a little more
stressed than normal.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.197
I know. I'm sorry.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.266
I'm just worried
nobody's gonna volunteer
for this thing

19:26.299 --> 19:28.568
and I really don't want
to let Gray down.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.937
You'll have plenty
of volunteers. Trust me.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.340
(BELL RINGING)

19:33.373 --> 19:34.507
Don't you have
fifth period gym
to teach?

19:34.541 --> 19:35.642
Nope. Not anymore.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.311
I gave everyone
in class the option
of running laps

19:38.345 --> 19:40.447
or participating in
your video project.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.482
Ben!

19:42.515 --> 19:52.559
Which one do you
think they chose?

19:52.559 --> 19:58.465
Which one do you
think they chose?

19:58.498 --> 20:01.968
Three, two, one, action!

20:02.001 --> 20:06.239
What's my fashion inspiration?
I have no idea.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.308
I just didn't wanna run laps.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.209
I try to inspire
everyone.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.246
Lulu's my inspiration.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.314
(MOUTHING)

20:14.347 --> 20:18.017
My inspiration would
probably be my grandmother.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.686
She told me a long time ago
to always think for myself,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.354
so that's what I do.

20:21.388 --> 20:26.659
God. And Gucci.

20:26.693 --> 20:30.530
I'm interested
in the intersection
of feminist and feminine.

20:30.563 --> 20:34.367
My style plays with
expectations of gender
without playing into them.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.269
I don't know.
I wore this yesterday.

20:36.303 --> 20:40.540
To be honest?
I dress to disappear.

20:40.573 --> 20:44.444
What's my personal style?
I guess it's changing
and evolving.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.680
I'm just trying
to figure out who I am.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.681
And right now,

20:49.649 --> 20:51.718
I'm sort of liking it.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.821
The students at Whitemarsh
High School are real teens.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.690
And real teens don't want
to be force-fed trends.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.759
They want to
be themselves.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.061
Find themselves.
They want to...

21:02.094 --> 21:03.763
Wear who they are.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.399
GRAY: "Wear who you are."

21:06.433 --> 21:10.803
I love it. I can see this
as our new ad campaign.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.740
Donovan will be thrilled.
Good job, Jane.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.477
AndYes?ia?

21:17.510 --> 21:19.446
How's your new line
coming along?

21:19.479 --> 21:21.548
It's coming along great.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.449
Can you believe Gray
actually bought this?

21:22.482 --> 21:24.717
I thought it was great.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.586
I don't remember
asking your opinion,
Jeremy.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.788
That's not my point.
ActualMy point...t did.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.658
I mean, come on.
"Wear who you are."

21:31.691 --> 21:32.359
You've got to admit
that's pretty good.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.862
Can you leave
my office now?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.797
Fine.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.299
Wait!

21:41.734 --> 21:42.935
I know that guy.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.641
Wow, India, I didn't
realize you were
into high school boys.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.444
I know him.
How do I know him?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.311
You're asking me?

21:52.345 --> 21:54.847
He just looks so
familiar and I think...

21:54.881 --> 21:58.418
No, I know.
I know that I know him.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.454
And how, precisely, is it
that you know a high school
boy from Whitemarsh?

22:01.488 --> 22:02.489
Exactly! I don't.
How could I?

22:02.522 --> 22:04.657
It's impossible, right?

22:06.559 --> 22:07.894
Okay, I'm really
not following.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.630
You know what I think?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.098
I think these aren't
even real high school
students.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.534
I think Jane faked
this whole thing.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.406
(SCOFFS) Why on earth
would she do that?

22:19.439 --> 22:20.773
To impress Gray?

22:25.578 --> 22:28.114
Looks like it worked.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.850
Well, she's not gonna
get away with it.

22:30.883 --> 22:34.587
Jane put together this whole
stupid, fake video thing
just to humiliate me.

22:34.621 --> 22:35.855
You really think
Jane would do that?

22:35.888 --> 22:40.159
I don't know, but
I'm gonna find out.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.462
Good idea.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.430
Maybe you should
investigate.

22:47.900 --> 22:48.735
(SIGHS)

22:49.736 --> 22:51.370
I think I will.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.741
Of course Jane was here.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.809
Where else would she be?

22:56.843 --> 22:58.411
So, she did interview
your students?

22:58.445 --> 22:59.746
Yes.
Are you from YouTube?

22:59.779 --> 23:02.649
What? No. I'm from
Donovan Decker.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.052
Oh, right. From Jane's...

23:06.085 --> 23:08.555
Look, I just want to talk
to you about the video
presentation Jane made.

23:08.588 --> 23:08.721
Oh, that's nice.
How was it?

23:10.590 --> 23:12.692
It was fine.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.962
Because the kids here
really enjoyed participating
in Jane's project.

23:15.995 --> 23:19.165
The whole idea of figuring out
who you are in high school
through your look,

23:19.198 --> 23:20.967
your personal style,
it really resonated with them.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.903
(INDIA TEXTING)

23:23.936 --> 23:26.806
Honestly, I just think
it's important to start
an early dialogue...

23:28.841 --> 23:30.677
Oh, good. You're back.

23:30.710 --> 23:31.811
Sorry.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.946
Yeah. Jane's video,
blah, blah, blah.
I got it.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.515
She's terrific.
We're all good.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.649
Look, the real reason
I'm here, Miss...

23:36.683 --> 23:38.585
Miss Shaw.

23:38.618 --> 23:42.221
The real reason
I'm here is that
I'm looking for a guy.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.990
Aren't we all? (LAUGHING)

23:46.959 --> 23:48.795
Right.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.897
I'm looking for a guy
from Jane's video.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.999
Okay. Who was it?

23:53.032 --> 23:55.602
Actually, I don't have
a name, but I'd know
him if I saw him.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.971
I need him to sign
a release form
for records.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.741
Yeah. Jane forgot
to get that which is
a really big no-no.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.910
And I certainly
don't want to get
Jane in any trouble.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.680
No, of course not.
How can I help?

24:07.714 --> 24:09.716
Maybe I could
take a quick look
around school?

24:09.749 --> 24:11.918
Find the guy in question,
get his signature,
Jane's still a winner.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.687
I'll be out of
your hair in no time.

24:14.721 --> 24:14.787
How does that sound?

24:33.873 --> 24:36.275
So, what do you think
of our school?

24:36.308 --> 24:37.677
It's very...

24:38.778 --> 24:39.779
Public.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.816
Oh, no. No, no, no.

24:45.785 --> 24:46.919
Jane, we have a problem.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.521
I'm glad you agree,

24:48.555 --> 24:50.289
because this is really
not working for me.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.792
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about her.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.265
What is she
doing here?

24:59.298 --> 25:00.066
What is India Jourdain
doing in our high school?

25:00.099 --> 25:01.734
I have no idea.

25:08.708 --> 25:09.976
No. No.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.078
No.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.746
Next! Wait.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.284
Not him. Next.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.553
Nope. Nope.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.555
You know what?
I'm so sorry.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.489
I actually have
a parent-teacher
conference

25:23.522 --> 25:24.824
that's about to start.
Would you mind...

25:24.857 --> 25:26.693
Continuing on my own?
I'd love to.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.827
Actually, waiting here.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.596
I'll send someone
to walk you around.

25:29.629 --> 25:30.863
Of course.

25:40.006 --> 25:40.973
(BELL RINGING)

26:31.057 --> 26:32.725
Hey, guys, what's...

26:36.796 --> 26:37.830
BILLY: That was close.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.632
JANE: What is going on?

26:39.666 --> 26:40.733
I have no idea,
but you need to get
out of here, Janey.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.769
You need to leave
school before
she sees you.

26:42.802 --> 26:43.936
I can't do that.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.371
Because?

26:45.404 --> 26:47.006
I need to see what
India is after, Billy.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.007
We both know she's
not here on accident.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.643
She's here because of
the video presentation

26:50.677 --> 26:53.045
and I can't just let her roam
the halls of Whitemarsh High

26:53.079 --> 26:55.915
trying to destroy everything
that I've worked so hard
to build at Donovan Decker.

26:56.949 --> 26:57.817
Wait.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.191
Hey, guys.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.625
Hey, Nick.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.698
Well, I should
probably, um...

27:18.137 --> 27:20.072
Do you think that
looked weird?

27:20.106 --> 27:21.040
Little bit.

27:23.442 --> 27:26.813
Do you think I'm weird?

27:26.846 --> 27:30.016
Seriously, Ben, just because
we have adjoining offices

27:30.049 --> 27:32.719
doesn't mean you can come in
here uninvited all the time.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.953
Sorry about that.
Back to the question.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.989
Do you think I'm weird?

27:37.023 --> 27:37.757
No, Ben. I do not
think you're weird.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.092
You're the opposite
of weird.

27:40.126 --> 27:43.029
You are, in fact,
completely devoid
of neuroses.

27:43.062 --> 27:46.232
You have no hang-ups or any
deviant interests whatsoever.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.935
You're handsome,
but not weirdly handsome.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.737
Your little sister drives
you to work every day,

27:50.770 --> 27:54.907
which, yes,
is a little weird,
but also sweet.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.109
You love baseball.

27:57.143 --> 28:00.112
That's basically
the least weird thing
you can like in America.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.247
Happy now?

28:03.783 --> 28:07.019
You think I'm handsome?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.989
Oh, God.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.159
Okay, okay. Would it be
weird if I asked you to have
a drink with me after work?

28:13.960 --> 28:14.994
Yes.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.028
Good weird or bad weird?

28:21.300 --> 28:21.868
Good weird. I guess.

28:24.503 --> 28:25.171
It's a date.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.906
Not a date!
Just a drink.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.146
JANE: How long do
you think we should
wait in here?

28:34.180 --> 28:36.182
Couple more minutes.
To be safe.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.789
This is temporary, right?

28:42.822 --> 28:44.356
What?

28:44.390 --> 28:47.760
Come on. You really think
this is a good time to be
talking about my hair?

28:47.794 --> 28:49.061
You promised you
wouI didn't.nge.

28:49.095 --> 28:54.033
Really? Because you look
like a completely
different person.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.835
You're really gonna
tell me this has nothing
to do with Lulu?

28:55.868 --> 28:58.070
No. It's not her.
It's me.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.306
I'm tired of being judged
for the way I look, Janey.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.541
I just...

29:02.574 --> 29:05.111
I want to see if it makes
a difference. That's all.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.113
And if it doesn't?

29:07.146 --> 29:08.781
I don't know.

29:08.815 --> 29:09.816
We can't just
keep hiding.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.818
You have to go out there
and see what she wants.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.052
Yeah, you.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.320
She doesn't know you.
You can get close
and see if...

29:14.353 --> 29:15.788
Jane.

29:15.822 --> 29:16.856
What?

29:16.889 --> 29:18.224
India knows me.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.291
No, she doesn't.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.127
Yes. I was at the trunk show.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.328
Oh, come on.
She was passed out.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.996
She's never gonna remember.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.065
No, before that.
When I got to the party.

29:26.098 --> 29:26.866
I met her before
I saw you.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.235
How could you
not tell me this?

29:29.268 --> 29:30.302
I don't know.
I didn't think it
was important.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.107
Wait. It's fine.
We're totally fine!

29:35.141 --> 29:37.009
It wasn't you at
the trunk show at all.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.544
Janey. It was me.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.279
No, it was old you.
Not preppy, douchey you.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.082
Thanks a lot.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.951
You know what I mean.
You look completely
different.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.820
And she was
totally tipsy.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.255
There's no way
she's gonna be able
to put it all together.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.292
Okay. Fine. But if I do this
little recon trip of yours,

29:53.325 --> 29:56.963
will you please stop
complaining about my hair?

29:56.996 --> 29:58.898
Never.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.299
Didn't think so.
All right. Wish me luck.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.282
You.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.386
Me?

30:20.419 --> 30:23.189

30:23.222 --> 30:24.323
Uh, you don't.

30:24.356 --> 30:27.259
Yes. I do. How?

30:27.293 --> 30:30.229
Maybe I just have
one of those faces,
you know?

30:30.262 --> 30:31.864
The trunk show
at Gray's house.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.099

30:33.132 --> 30:34.400
You were there,
weren't you?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.002
Mmm-hmm. That's it.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.004
Yes, you were.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.538
Sorry. Wrong guy.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.909
There's something fishy
going on here and I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.011
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.879
Admit it. You know Jane.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.982
Oh, please.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.117
Okay, I'm sorry,
ma'am.

at that trunk show,

35:00.432 --> 35:02.468
I like your bag.

35:07.506 --> 35:10.309
And we're walking!

35:13.479 --> 35:14.480
(BELL RINGING)

35:18.450 --> 35:20.152
Threat neutralized.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.421
I can't believe it.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.291
Hey, am I missing something?

35:25.324 --> 35:27.125
Nope.
Nothing at all.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.396
Looks like I'm up.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.301
Here you go.
You left it on the couch.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.602
Thank you.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.473
Thank you for all
your help today.

35:41.507 --> 35:44.276
Oh, it's
my pleasure.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.379
I hope you got
everything you needed.

35:47.413 --> 35:51.483
Yes. We did.
And we are so grateful
for all your assistance.

35:51.517 --> 35:52.518
Aren't we, India?

35:54.620 --> 35:56.322
I'm Rita by the way.
And you are?

35:56.355 --> 35:57.956
Jeremy Jones.
Donovan Decker.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.326
Oh, so you work
with Jane also?

36:00.359 --> 36:02.194
Yes. Yes, I do.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.695
She's one of our most
proCan we go now?es.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.497
Well, I'm glad
to hear Jane's making
such an impression.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.333
Maybe once she...

36:07.366 --> 36:09.301
Sorry to be rude,
but we're kind of
in a hurry.

36:09.335 --> 36:12.404
Oh. Of course.
Well, come by any time.
Nice to meet you, Jeremy.

36:12.438 --> 36:12.738
It was a pleasure, Rita.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.344
Are we done with your
little investigation?

36:18.377 --> 36:19.445
Oh, shut up.

36:21.747 --> 36:25.617
At 7:55 on the morning
of December 7th, 1941,

36:25.651 --> 36:27.753
the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor.

36:27.786 --> 36:31.590
On that day, the nation
woke up to war.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.493
However, in many ways,
Japan awakened more
than just a nation

36:34.526 --> 36:36.495
full of shocked
and angry Americans.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.763
It awakened
a sleeping giant,

36:37.796 --> 36:41.300
because the U.S. had
no intention of going
to war until...

36:51.410 --> 36:53.245
(DOOR OPENING)

36:55.747 --> 37:01.620
So, in conclusion,
I just want to thank

37:01.653 --> 37:07.326
each and every one of you
for helping me with my teen
trend research on Wednesday.

37:07.359 --> 37:12.298
And like Franklin Delano
Roosevelt once said after
the attack on Pearl Harbor,

37:12.331 --> 37:14.600
it was a date which
will live in infamy.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.601
Hi.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.239
What are you
guys doing here?

37:23.309 --> 37:26.011
India was just following up
on your research.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.347
Oh.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.781
What are you
doing here?

37:29.815 --> 37:32.484
Well, I...

37:32.518 --> 37:36.588
I just wanted to thank a few
students who helped me with
my presentation the other day.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.426
Is that right?

37:40.459 --> 37:40.526
Yeah.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.798
Whatever.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.036
Well, India and I
are headed back
to the city.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.203
Would you like
a ride, Jane?

37:52.237 --> 37:57.609
No. No, thanks.
I still have a few more
people to thank.

37:57.643 --> 38:01.480
So, I'll see
you guys at work.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.690
(SIGHS)

38:11.723 --> 38:14.560
Well, that was
a colossal waste of time.

38:14.593 --> 38:15.827
I'm glad you're finally
being rational.

38:15.861 --> 38:20.399
And here we see
the Marines planting
the flag on Iwo Jima.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.801
Right there in that picture.
A historic moment signifying
the beginning of the end

38:22.834 --> 38:26.438
of the United States'
involvement...

38:28.374 --> 38:29.375
So.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.680
So.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.348
What do you think?

38:36.382 --> 38:38.384
Driver off the tee?

38:38.417 --> 38:40.486
You know, the fairway's
cut pretty thin today.

38:40.519 --> 38:40.586
I would just go with
the three wood.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.689
Okay.

38:43.722 --> 38:44.556
Give me the three.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.392
Okay.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.697
Connie Marshall.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.765
Two kids.
Church choir.
Little hefty.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.402
Jimmy Bradshaw.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.736
Kind of went off
the deep end.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.538
Last I heard, he was
living in an ashram.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.474
What about Ashley Miller?

39:02.508 --> 39:05.444
Also married. Twice.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.513
I knew it.
She was crazy hot.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.682
Oh, I've got a good one.
Rita Shaw.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.555
She put out
a country album.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.725
Huge hit. Became
incredibly famous.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.494
But then she gave it up.
Didn't like the limelight.

39:22.528 --> 39:23.895
So noble.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.597
Yes. Yes, she was.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.736
I've got another
one for you.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.473
Ben Quimby.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.177
I think I remember him.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.812
Tall, good-looking,
funny, a little bit off?

39:42.581 --> 39:44.916
That's the one.
Big baseball star.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.719
Whatever happened to him?

39:49.721 --> 39:52.558
Pursued life-long dream
of stay-at-home brother.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.794
Baseball was a fallback.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.763
Oh, come on.
You were great.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.167
I was okay.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.436
You had a full
scholarship to Miami.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.472
And then you gave it all up
to come back home for Jane.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.808
You did a good thing.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.610
I know.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.480
* The sun will shine
on us below

40:14.513 --> 40:17.783
* All our days

40:17.816 --> 40:20.218
* Growing up
and old together

40:20.251 --> 40:23.188
* Couldn't even
dream a better... *

40:23.221 --> 40:25.591
"A day which will
live in infamy"?

40:25.624 --> 40:26.892
You totally flunked
that presentation.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.795
I can't believe
we pulled it off.

40:29.828 --> 40:32.998
I know. Did you see India's
face when she saw you
through the window?

40:33.031 --> 40:34.500
I thought you were had.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.834
Yeah, you and me both.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.869
That's because
you and me...

40:37.903 --> 40:39.671
We always
do all right.

40:39.705 --> 40:40.639
Always.

40:43.775 --> 40:48.647
I'm sorry that I gave you
such a hard time
about your new look.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.483
You're right.
You are always
there for me.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.519
And I really should've been
there for you with this.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.556
It's okay.

40:57.589 --> 41:02.628
So, now that you've
had a few days to let
the new do sink in,

41:02.661 --> 41:04.596
give me
an honest evaluation.

41:04.630 --> 41:05.797
Honestly?

41:05.831 --> 41:06.431
I still hate it.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.870
But you're
my best friend.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.540
And you've been
my best friend
since third grade.

41:14.573 --> 41:17.609
And I love you no matter
how ridiculous you look.

41:17.643 --> 41:20.546
(LAUGHS)

41:20.579 --> 41:20.746
That's better.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.061
Hey.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.630
I'm weird.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.599
What?

41:40.632 --> 41:42.534
I'm sort of weird, okay?

41:42.568 --> 41:42.601
Yeah, I know.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.773
And I am acknowledging
said weirdness to you
now because...

41:47.806 --> 41:50.041
...that's me.

41:50.075 --> 41:53.545
I'm complicated
and I have goals and
there's a lot about me

41:53.579 --> 41:54.913
that you dJane.know and...

41:54.946 --> 41:56.548
I just think it's best
that you know the real me

41:56.582 --> 41:59.618
and not some version of me
that's trying to be something
that I'm not because...

42:05.891 --> 42:08.860
For the record,
I like weird.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.596
You do?

42:10.629 --> 42:12.330
Yeah. I do.

42:12.363 --> 42:17.035
* Gotta let you know
how I feel inside

42:17.068 --> 42:23.308
* Just a little piece
of what's on my mind

42:23.341 --> 42:26.678
* 'Cause I made it
on my own, whoa

42:26.712 --> 42:27.846
* I keep right to the beat

42:27.879 --> 42:31.316
* I keep right to the beat

42:31.349 --> 42:34.586
* I dance to the beat
of my own drum

42:36.622 --> 42:38.957
* 'Cause I keep
right to the beat

42:38.990 --> 42:41.727
* I keep right to the beat

42:41.760 --> 42:44.062
* I dance to the beat
of my own drum *
