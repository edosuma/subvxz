WEBVTT

00:52.305 --> 00:54.108
It should be
right near here.

00:54.175 --> 00:55.645
- If there
is an anti-government group

00:55.711 --> 00:58.383
camped out up here...

00:58.449 --> 01:00.087
a police car would be
a heck of a trophy.

01:00.153 --> 01:01.790
Not to mention a detective.

01:06.366 --> 01:07.802
Detective Pyre.
Go ahead.

01:07.869 --> 01:09.739
<i>Salt Lake's
police records arrived.</i>

01:09.806 --> 01:13.915
<i>One for Dan Lafferty,
second for Allen Lafferty.</i>

01:13.981 --> 01:15.585
- Allen has a record.

01:15.652 --> 01:17.756
<i>Yep.
Unpaid traffic citations.</i>

01:17.823 --> 01:20.494
<i>Enough to get him arrested
the morning after his wedding.</i>

01:20.562 --> 01:22.999
<i>Served time on a related
contempt of court charge.</i>

01:23.066 --> 01:25.070
- Well, if he tries
to walk out of there,

01:25.137 --> 01:27.041
charge him.
Copy?

01:27.107 --> 01:28.343
<i>10-4.</i>

01:32.852 --> 01:34.054
- There.

01:43.675 --> 01:45.410
That's Taba's car.

01:55.230 --> 01:56.733
- See those?

02:08.089 --> 02:10.026
Okay.

02:10.093 --> 02:11.429
One of those vests.

02:11.496 --> 02:13.366
You both--
you're gonna stay here.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.136
Be a radio chain.
All right?

02:15.203 --> 02:16.540
Stay safe.

02:16.606 --> 02:17.909
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

02:57.488 --> 02:59.459
Get your boots
off of this holy land,

02:59.526 --> 03:01.797
or your blood will spill.

03:04.970 --> 03:06.973
- Backup. Backup.
Call in County for backup.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.811
<i>10-4.
10-4.</i>

03:08.877 --> 03:11.716
<i>Might take some time for them
to find us up here, sir.</i>

03:11.783 --> 03:12.952
Copy.

03:17.828 --> 03:20.133
You have no authority here!

03:21.570 --> 03:24.108
We'll defend
our private property.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.338
Okay.

04:04.088 --> 04:06.059
Get your boots
off of this holy land,

04:06.125 --> 04:08.362
or your blood will spill.

04:54.957 --> 04:56.026
Ahh!
- Ahh!

04:56.092 --> 04:58.931
- Oh.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.135
- You scared
the crap out of me.

05:03.072 --> 05:04.075
- Tell me you're not alone.

05:04.141 --> 05:07.582
- I got deputies at the--
at the woods' edge.

05:07.649 --> 05:09.051
Calling for backup.

05:09.118 --> 05:11.022
- Good.

05:11.089 --> 05:12.592
- Detective Pyre.
I'm here with Detective Taba.

05:12.659 --> 05:14.729
He's--how you doing?

05:14.796 --> 05:17.802
- Busted my ankle.
Took my--my boot off

05:17.869 --> 05:19.404
to check it out,
and it won't go back on.

05:19.471 --> 05:20.574
- Everyone knows
you don't take your boot off

05:20.641 --> 05:21.610
when you twist your ankle.

05:21.677 --> 05:22.745
- You're such a Boy Scout.

05:22.812 --> 05:24.015
- Eagle Scout,
thank you very much.

05:24.081 --> 05:25.618
Gonna need help getting Taba
back to safety

05:25.684 --> 05:27.923
<i>when that arrives.
10-4.</i>

05:27.989 --> 05:30.561
<i>It'll take 40 minutes.
Hold tight.</i>

05:30.628 --> 05:33.432
- Oh, boy, I'm happy
to see you alive, Bill.

05:34.803 --> 05:38.042
- Never been happier
to see you, Jeb.

05:43.019 --> 05:45.525
You have no authority here!

05:45.591 --> 05:48.496
We will defend
our private property.

05:48.564 --> 05:50.000
- Screaming that for an hour.

05:50.066 --> 05:52.639
contempt of court.

05:52.705 --> 05:56.312
Seems he shares his brother's
disdain for our kind.

05:56.379 --> 05:58.517
- It's all in the family, huh?

06:01.790 --> 06:02.792
- Really?

06:04.328 --> 06:06.900
- Got a smoke?
I'd prefer it.

06:27.976 --> 06:29.144
- Okay.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.318
- Josie, it's Becca.
I brought you some cake.

06:52.825 --> 06:53.961
Josie?

06:59.104 --> 07:00.541
Josie?

07:01.576 --> 07:02.912
Josie!

07:29.464 --> 07:30.834
- You see that?

07:35.410 --> 07:37.347
- I need eyes
on the forest line

07:37.414 --> 07:38.684
due north of our position.

07:38.751 --> 07:40.721
I'm afraid we got company
outside the cabin too.

07:40.788 --> 07:42.324
<i>All right.
10-4.</i>

07:42.391 --> 07:43.660
<i>Backup's on the way.</i>

07:48.603 --> 07:49.806
- I'm gonna go there.

07:49.872 --> 07:51.710
- Check it.
- Yeah.

07:55.551 --> 07:57.556
Stay safe.

08:16.292 --> 08:17.995
- Stop struggling. It's okay.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.066
It's okay.
I got you. I got you.

08:23.907 --> 08:25.644
Josie?

08:25.711 --> 08:26.613
- Josie?
- Josie?

08:26.680 --> 08:27.882
Josie?

08:27.949 --> 08:30.454
She's not there.
I checked.

08:30.521 --> 08:31.856
- The garage
has been checked twice,

08:31.923 --> 08:33.126
and there is no sign
of his mother.

08:33.193 --> 08:34.529
- Okay.
- So I think it is time

08:34.595 --> 08:35.864
that I open my address book

08:35.931 --> 08:37.334
and call the brethren
to service.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.637
- Please, I don't need this

08:38.703 --> 08:40.641
turning into some sort
of news story, okay?

08:40.708 --> 08:42.612
Uh w--um...

08:42.678 --> 08:45.417
Annie, Caroline, Mama's gonna
take a walk around the block

08:45.483 --> 08:46.886
with Sister Dorren, okay?

08:46.953 --> 08:49.258
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

09:14.475 --> 09:16.311
- Hi. Hi, honey.

09:19.820 --> 09:20.988
These yours?

09:22.625 --> 09:25.197
You out picking elderberries,

09:25.263 --> 09:29.137
and then you find these out
in someone's campsite, maybe?

09:31.876 --> 09:34.582
I have two daughters of my own.
They love stickers,

09:34.649 --> 09:36.953
but these
are something special.

09:37.020 --> 09:39.692
Honey, if you want them back,
you go right ahead.

09:41.863 --> 09:44.100
Well, my name's Jeb.

09:45.303 --> 09:47.508
And folks call me Pyre

09:47.575 --> 09:51.415
or Officer Pyre
or Brother Pyre.

09:51.482 --> 09:53.085
I like the Brother.

09:54.387 --> 09:55.892
What do they call you?

09:55.958 --> 09:58.763
- Jenny.
Jenny Lafferty.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.611
- Well, that's
a wonderful name.

10:07.414 --> 10:09.586
You mind telling me your mom
and your dad's names,

10:09.653 --> 10:11.021
so I can get you back to them?

10:11.088 --> 10:12.591
Unless you don't want
to go back.

10:12.658 --> 10:14.595
- I want to go back.
- Okay, good.

10:14.662 --> 10:15.931
So what are their names?

10:15.998 --> 10:20.173
- My dad is Sam,
and my mom is Sara.

10:20.239 --> 10:22.110
- Sam and Sara.

10:22.177 --> 10:25.249
Are they--are they
in the cabin waiting for you?

10:26.385 --> 10:28.422
- I don't know.

10:28.489 --> 10:29.725
- Okay.

10:29.792 --> 10:33.600
Daddy sent me,
my sister, and Mom

10:33.667 --> 10:35.738
to go pick for food.

10:35.805 --> 10:37.675
- I see.
So where are they now?

10:37.742 --> 10:39.345
Where's your sister
and your mom?

10:39.411 --> 10:41.616
- I lost them in the forest.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.187
I don't know
who's in the fort now.

10:46.359 --> 10:48.196
- So that's a fort
up there, huh?

10:48.262 --> 10:49.231
Is that a fort?

10:49.298 --> 10:50.634
For--for an army?

10:52.470 --> 10:54.675
With--with soldiers inside?

10:54.742 --> 10:56.647
- They come and go.

10:56.713 --> 10:57.715
- Who comes and goes?

10:57.782 --> 10:59.652
- The men.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.365
- Hey.
You know what?

11:06.432 --> 11:10.439
I just remembered,
I met a Lafferty once.

11:11.676 --> 11:13.145
You know who?

11:14.414 --> 11:17.555
Allen Lafferty
and his wife Brenda.

11:17.622 --> 11:19.559
- Auntie Brenda
and Uncle Allen.

11:19.626 --> 11:21.295
- Do they ever come
around here?

11:22.497 --> 11:23.900
Do you ever get to see them,

11:23.967 --> 11:26.472
play with them,
maybe on special occasions?

11:26.540 --> 11:27.875
- Special occasions.

11:27.942 --> 11:29.311
- Hey, I mean,
you wouldn't have been invited

11:29.378 --> 11:31.382
to--to their wedding,
would you?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.006
You remember anything else
about that day

11:43.072 --> 11:44.274
or the morning after,

11:44.341 --> 11:46.245
maybe something
about your Uncle Allen?

11:56.833 --> 11:58.537
- Jenny!
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:58.604 --> 12:00.774
- Hey! Liar!

12:00.841 --> 12:03.145
She's a liar!

12:04.582 --> 12:06.285
Sister Lafferty.

12:07.087 --> 12:09.925
I'm Brother Pyre.
This is Detective Taba.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.301
You're Jenny's mother?

12:17.608 --> 12:18.777
So first and foremost,

12:18.844 --> 12:20.112
we need to know
who all is in that cabin,

12:20.179 --> 12:22.885
'cause nobody wants anyone
getting hurt today.

12:22.952 --> 12:26.894
- My sons follow
Heavenly Father's commands.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.464
He rewards them
with His protection.

12:29.532 --> 12:31.536
- So they're inside?

12:31.603 --> 12:34.408
Hey, we heard there was an army
forming up here.

12:34.475 --> 12:36.479
Looking to do battle
with the federal government?

12:36.546 --> 12:39.017
Something about taxes?
Is that right?

12:39.084 --> 12:42.290
- There are tares
all around us now,

12:42.357 --> 12:43.459
not just the feds.

12:43.527 --> 12:44.696
- Tares?

12:44.763 --> 12:47.433
- Heavenly Father's army
will separate Earth's wheat

12:47.500 --> 12:50.139
from its tares
in the end of days.

12:50.206 --> 12:51.509
- By tares, you mean sinners,

12:51.576 --> 12:53.680
and by wheat,
you mean the Lord's elect.

12:53.747 --> 12:55.550
- Saints.
- Saints.

12:55.617 --> 12:57.353
Who follow the covenants.

12:58.656 --> 13:01.596
You follow all
of your covenants, brother?

13:01.663 --> 13:03.600
- He probably does, actually.

13:03.666 --> 13:05.470
Me, on the other hand, um--

13:05.538 --> 13:09.278
how much time do I have
till this judgment day, ma'am?

13:09.344 --> 13:13.352
- In the latter days,
the dark skin of the Lamanites

13:13.419 --> 13:16.693
will blossom like the rose
and become white

13:16.759 --> 13:18.864
and delightsome again.

13:18.930 --> 13:22.103
This invasion is one
of His final signs, so...

13:23.472 --> 13:27.413
I'd get myself
to a baptismal font quick.

13:34.194 --> 13:36.064
- Why'd you call Jenny a liar?

13:36.131 --> 13:38.369
- She speaks about things
she doesn't understand.

13:38.436 --> 13:40.874
- She was only telling me
about her Uncle Allen

13:40.941 --> 13:43.112
and Aunt Brenda's wedding.
That's all.

13:44.181 --> 13:45.450
Unless there was something

13:45.518 --> 13:47.922
she would have lied about
about that day.

13:47.988 --> 13:50.226
- You should ask Brenda
and Allen, not me.

13:52.230 --> 13:53.667
- Well,
I--I've never met Brenda,

13:53.733 --> 13:56.438
so would she be more
of a wheat or a tare?

13:57.708 --> 14:00.514
Your daughter said
that, um, Brenda fit right in

14:00.580 --> 14:02.618
with the Lafferty family.

14:02.685 --> 14:04.154
I was there.

14:05.724 --> 14:09.164
Heavenly Father's laws
are black or white.

14:10.299 --> 14:12.739
Brenda...

14:12.805 --> 14:15.443
she's an ugly shade of gray.

14:15.511 --> 14:17.948
- So what happened
in the temple?

14:35.551 --> 14:37.220
- Are you all right?

14:37.287 --> 14:39.993
We know what just happened,
don't we, Matilda?

14:40.059 --> 14:41.663
A woman older
than Jesus' sandals

14:41.730 --> 14:45.002
just put oil very, very close
to my private parts.

14:45.069 --> 14:46.338
- It took me by surprise too.

14:46.405 --> 14:47.741
I thought they kept me
in the dark

14:47.808 --> 14:49.177
because I didn't grow up LDS,

14:49.244 --> 14:51.148
but I guess
they don't tell any of us.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.485
- The temple workers
are listening.

14:53.553 --> 14:54.823
You're not supposed
to be talking

14:54.889 --> 14:56.458
or making light
of sacred things.

14:56.526 --> 14:59.632
- Soon I will surrender
to Allen for time and eternity.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.436
I'll be a Lafferty,
but when we covenant,

15:02.504 --> 15:04.542
we don't give up our own minds.

15:04.609 --> 15:05.977
- Of course not.

15:07.347 --> 15:09.184
It's important
that Brenda knows she doesn't

15:09.251 --> 15:11.589
just earn a husband today,
but sisters, too,

15:11.656 --> 15:13.092
forever,

15:13.158 --> 15:15.797
to keep all of our agency
strong.

15:15.864 --> 15:17.701
- What do you mean, "agency"?

15:17.768 --> 15:20.607
- As in free agency.

15:20.674 --> 15:22.578
- Nothing holy is free.

15:26.452 --> 15:29.090
<i>I mean, I'm flabbergasted</i>

15:29.157 --> 15:30.528
<i>that she would have broken</i>

15:30.594 --> 15:33.600
temple rules
on her own wedding day.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.906
I--I imagine that would have
really upset you.

15:36.973 --> 15:38.710
- She's a pretender.

15:39.512 --> 15:43.286
She's drawn to converts
like Dianna and Matilda

15:43.352 --> 15:45.657
more than real LDS women.

15:45.724 --> 15:47.426
<i>...the most high God,</i>

15:47.493 --> 15:51.468
to rule and reign
in the House of Israel forever.

15:51.536 --> 15:55.544
Sisters, you have been washed
and anointed to become queens

15:55.610 --> 15:58.249
and priestesses
to your husbands.

15:58.315 --> 16:01.421
Names, signs, and penalties,

16:01.488 --> 16:03.727
which you will receive
in the temple this day,

16:03.794 --> 16:05.163
are most sacred,

16:05.229 --> 16:07.000
and are guarded
by solemn covenants

16:07.066 --> 16:09.505
and obligations of secrecy,

16:09.572 --> 16:12.343
to the effect
that under no condition,

16:12.410 --> 16:17.353
even at the peril of your life,
will you ever divulge them.

16:18.857 --> 16:21.929
<i>If I was a man...</i>

16:21.996 --> 16:24.367
<i>with the priesthood...</i>

16:25.804 --> 16:27.240
I'd call her a tare.

16:27.307 --> 16:30.480
- So what happens to tares
in the end of days, Sister?

16:30.547 --> 16:32.685
- According to Prophets Joseph
and Brigham,

16:32.752 --> 16:35.657
there are some sins
beyond repentance.

16:37.426 --> 16:41.101
Some say the only way
to forgive a tare...

16:41.168 --> 16:43.205
is through the doctrine
of blood atonement.

16:45.611 --> 16:48.382
- I'm sorry. I--

16:48.449 --> 16:50.052
I must have missed that lesson.

16:55.029 --> 16:57.668
<i>It means...</i>

16:57.735 --> 17:02.176
<i>to cleanse one
of their sins...</i>

17:02.243 --> 17:06.152
by spilling their blood
out onto the ground.

17:08.623 --> 17:10.192
Brother.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.745
- Hey.
- Any more on who all's inside?

17:19.812 --> 17:21.081
- No, nothing exact,

17:21.148 --> 17:23.554
but she made it sound like
all of her sons are in there,

17:23.620 --> 17:26.258
and they're all
under 12 years old.

17:26.325 --> 17:28.161
I gotta pray for their safety.

17:28.228 --> 17:30.299
We got three or four
pioneer types

17:30.366 --> 17:32.170
holding up inside, we may well

17:32.237 --> 17:34.876
wrap this investigation up
right here.

17:34.943 --> 17:36.913
- Copy that.

17:36.980 --> 17:38.550
Everyone's in place.

17:38.617 --> 17:40.486
Bring your fire!

17:40.554 --> 17:42.992
The wrath of God
will extinguish it!

17:43.059 --> 17:45.998
We are ready to join
the true saints!

17:46.064 --> 17:48.402
- A flair for the dramatic.

17:48.469 --> 17:51.108
- I worry it's not an act.

17:51.175 --> 17:52.243
- You think
they'd martyr themselves

17:52.310 --> 17:54.347
without the press here
bearing witness?

17:54.414 --> 17:56.619
No, this type wants the glory.

17:56.686 --> 17:59.525
- No, my guess
is that Sam's army--

17:59.591 --> 18:01.462
they consider themselves
totally devout,

18:01.530 --> 18:04.367
willing to give up their lives
for their beliefs,

18:04.434 --> 18:08.341
and their own sons included
in their sacrifice.

18:08.408 --> 18:10.379
- Well, let's get in there now.

18:10.446 --> 18:12.751
- What if that's begging
for bloodshed?

18:15.957 --> 18:21.301
Allen told you that he feels
the key to solving this

18:21.368 --> 18:23.338
is to look to the saints,
right?

18:23.405 --> 18:24.876
I'm pretty sure, to Sam,

18:24.943 --> 18:27.715
this looks exactly
like the Haun's Mill massacre.

18:28.415 --> 18:31.188
<i>Missouri in 1838.</i>

18:31.255 --> 18:32.557
<i>The saints
were working the fields</i>

18:32.624 --> 18:35.296
<i>three days after
the Governor of Missouri</i>

18:35.363 --> 18:38.168
<i>put out an extinction order...</i>

18:38.235 --> 18:41.208
<i>to kill all Mormons.</i>

19:13.472 --> 19:15.978
<i>- The mill looked
</i>

19:16.045 --> 19:19.519
<i>made out of logs,
but with spaces in between,</i>

19:19.586 --> 19:21.354
<i>so that light could sneak in.</i>

19:22.724 --> 19:25.864
<i>And then, barrels
come in through those gaps.</i>

19:33.412 --> 19:35.717
Every single one of them
executed...

19:37.420 --> 19:39.925
<i>Apart from three Mormon boys,</i>

19:39.992 --> 19:41.829
<i>seven, nine,
and ten years old,</i>

19:41.896 --> 19:43.365
<i>who'd hidden themselves</i>

19:43.432 --> 19:45.202
<i>under
the blacksmiths' bellows.</i>

19:52.283 --> 19:54.755
- They're just boys, sir.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.838
- And nits make lice.

20:05.677 --> 20:10.419
- In Sam's mind, with our guns
all pointing at him,

20:10.486 --> 20:12.924
we are those militiamen.

20:21.408 --> 20:23.111
- What are you doing?

20:24.147 --> 20:27.988
- Proving to those inside that
I'm a Mormon before I'm a cop.

20:28.054 --> 20:30.193
- Jeb, you have a family.

20:30.259 --> 20:31.629
- I know.

20:31.696 --> 20:33.499
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

20:33.567 --> 20:34.969
if my daughters
came to think about me

20:35.035 --> 20:36.672
as one of those militiamen.

20:44.955 --> 20:46.960
I'm coming out.

20:47.027 --> 20:48.629
I'm unarmed!

20:50.967 --> 20:53.372
Lower your weapons!

20:53.439 --> 20:55.309
Weapons down.

20:56.278 --> 20:57.948
I'm unarmed, Sam.

21:01.121 --> 21:02.490
Brother?

21:09.304 --> 21:10.773
Sam?

21:14.247 --> 21:15.583
Sam?

21:19.090 --> 21:21.461
I'm Jeb. I'm Jeb Pyre.

21:23.065 --> 21:24.535
Can we talk?

21:25.837 --> 21:28.441
Brother to brother,
saint to saint.

21:31.381 --> 21:34.053
Let my girls go.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.926
Turn your men around...

21:36.992 --> 21:38.763
and I'll forgive this.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.737
- Thank you, brother.

21:45.375 --> 21:46.579
Thank you
for your understanding.

21:46.645 --> 21:48.983
Thank you for sparing me.

21:49.050 --> 21:50.386
Fine.

21:50.453 --> 21:52.389
Get off my land...

21:52.456 --> 21:53.893
right now.

21:53.960 --> 21:57.935
- Now, I understand,
and you have every right...

21:58.002 --> 22:01.341
to feel invaded...

22:01.408 --> 22:02.611
and to feel angry.

22:02.678 --> 22:04.481
I know how the authorities

22:04.548 --> 22:07.286
have treated
our most faithful.

22:07.353 --> 22:10.560
<i>When they slaughtered
our kind at Haun's Mill,</i>

22:10.627 --> 22:14.000
<i>our Prophet Joseph--
did he ever fire back?</i>

22:14.067 --> 22:17.508
<i>Did he ever resort
to violence?</i>

22:17.575 --> 22:20.412
<i>No.
He--he surrendered.</i>

22:21.883 --> 22:26.458
<i>He ensured the future
of our faith.</i>

22:29.230 --> 22:30.566
<i>Brother Lafferty,</i>

22:30.633 --> 22:33.673
<i>you can do the same
as our prophet...</i>

22:35.343 --> 22:38.014
And this can end peacefully,
Brother.

22:40.286 --> 22:42.490
No one gets hurt.

22:42.558 --> 22:44.461
I won't go down like Joseph!

22:44.528 --> 22:48.169
I am heir to Brigham Young,
Lion of the Lord!

22:50.138 --> 22:52.443
- Get down!
Get down on the ground!

22:52.511 --> 22:53.947
Get down!
- I got two in here!

22:54.014 --> 22:56.284
Your justice isn't Heaven's.

22:56.351 --> 22:57.688
Like you did to Joseph,

22:57.754 --> 22:59.625
you may sentence me to death
without trial,

22:59.692 --> 23:03.198
but it is you
who will suffer come eternity.

23:03.265 --> 23:04.835
Murderers!

23:04.902 --> 23:06.939
Apostate pigs!

23:07.006 --> 23:09.611
- I suggested you disarm
and get your hands in the air

23:09.678 --> 23:12.651
unless you want those
to be your final words.

23:14.588 --> 23:15.723
Pull him out.

23:18.462 --> 23:20.533
- Tyrants. Tyrants.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.272
Tyrants!
- Hey! Hey!

23:27.948 --> 23:29.785
Suspect running
in the forest.

23:29.852 --> 23:31.755
Back side of the cabin.

23:31.822 --> 23:34.360
Who was that?

23:34.427 --> 23:36.598
- One of Heavenly Father's
chosen.

23:39.237 --> 23:40.774
He's got blood on him.

23:40.841 --> 23:43.412
Looks like we got
ourselves a pioneer.

23:43.479 --> 23:45.248
One of four.

24:20.419 --> 24:21.689
- Mama Pyre?

24:21.756 --> 24:24.060
- Please help us, Sister.
- Josie?

24:24.127 --> 24:25.763
- Please, Heavenly Father.
Please...

24:25.830 --> 24:28.502
- Josie! Josie! Oh!

24:29.505 --> 24:31.041
- Oh, sweetheart.

24:31.108 --> 24:32.544
- Oh, you're okay.

24:34.314 --> 24:37.587
- She got on at a stop
ten blocks from here.

24:37.654 --> 24:40.660
A good long walk.
Impressive for her age, really.

24:40.727 --> 24:42.831
I tried explaining
that my route wouldn't take her

24:42.898 --> 24:45.937
all the way up past Sunset,
like she wanted,

24:46.004 --> 24:46.939
to farm country.

24:47.006 --> 24:48.677
That's where she grew up.

24:48.743 --> 24:49.979
- I'm just so pleased

24:50.045 --> 24:51.414
that I recognized her
from church, Sister.

24:51.481 --> 24:52.718
- From the church.

24:52.784 --> 24:53.953
- Thank you so much
for bringing her home.

24:54.020 --> 24:55.456
- You're very welcome.
- Thank you.

24:55.523 --> 24:57.459
- You're very welcome, okay?

24:57.527 --> 24:59.297
See you at church, okay?
You take care.

24:59.363 --> 25:02.003
- Thank you so much.
- You're very welcome.

25:02.070 --> 25:04.173
Oh.
I'm so happy to see you.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.577
- A wonderful man.

25:05.643 --> 25:07.815
And he belongs to the church,
our church.

25:07.881 --> 25:08.916
- Yes, he does.
- Yeah.

25:08.983 --> 25:11.021
And who are all these people?

25:11.087 --> 25:14.160
- It was the girls' birthday,
remember?

25:14.227 --> 25:15.095
- Oh.
- Remember?

25:15.162 --> 25:17.433
It was the girls' birthday.
- Yes.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.707
I-I-I need to go home now.

25:20.773 --> 25:22.644
- Yeah, o-okay. Yeah.

25:22.711 --> 25:25.282
But they're all--
they're all leaving now.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.153
Yes.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.388
Go home, please.

25:28.455 --> 25:29.591
Thank you.

25:29.658 --> 25:30.961
- Thank heavenly Father

25:31.028 --> 25:33.098
that she has you
and that I have you.

25:33.164 --> 25:36.304
<i>Sister Dorren
offered to watch her.</i>

25:36.371 --> 25:37.641
<i>If you can still make</i>

25:37.708 --> 25:39.244
<i>the girls' baptism meeting
tonight--</i>

25:39.311 --> 25:40.780
- Yes. Yes.

25:40.847 --> 25:42.717
I will see you at the church,
at the bishop's office.

25:42.784 --> 25:44.722
I love you so much, honey.

25:44.789 --> 25:46.290
<i>I love you too.</i>

25:47.594 --> 25:49.197
- Thank you.

25:49.264 --> 25:51.501
<i>- Bye, honey.</i>
- I'll see you soon.

25:51.569 --> 25:52.904
Bye.

26:10.372 --> 26:11.842
- There you go.

26:13.478 --> 26:15.282
It's gonna be okay.

26:16.484 --> 26:18.355
Starved.

26:19.257 --> 26:23.465
Well, let me tell you,
your family is A-okay.

26:23.533 --> 26:26.572
Take a few big breaths
for me now, sweetie, okay?

26:28.408 --> 26:29.744
- Yeah.

26:32.518 --> 26:35.757
Sounds to me like your family's
had a real tough time.

26:35.824 --> 26:37.192
Is that right?

26:39.129 --> 26:40.065
Yeah.

26:44.875 --> 26:48.081
I'll bet that it's a lot
of responsibility

26:48.148 --> 26:50.654
having a dad
who's such a big leader.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.422
How did you help him?

26:52.489 --> 26:56.732
- To pick the food,
the berries or vegetables,

26:56.799 --> 26:58.235
and bring it home

26:58.302 --> 27:00.740
without any bad people
seeing me.

27:00.807 --> 27:02.844
Who are the bad people?

27:05.316 --> 27:06.952
- People with uniforms.

27:08.923 --> 27:11.529
My daddy isn't the leader,
though.

27:11.595 --> 27:14.902
Please, please let him go.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.605
- Jenny,
if your daddy isn't the leader,

27:16.672 --> 27:18.174
do you know who is?

27:18.241 --> 27:21.181
- Heavenly Father
chose the leader.

27:21.247 --> 27:23.384
Well, you gotta remember
how to spell "just."

27:23.451 --> 27:24.622
You can't wash it off.

27:24.689 --> 27:26.792
Stand up.

27:26.859 --> 27:29.932
Bit much to almost destroy
our life's work.

27:29.999 --> 27:32.136
I've returned from what
should have been a joyous day

27:32.203 --> 27:35.109
to find I am about
to lose my home

27:35.176 --> 27:38.315
over unpaid taxes
and a license fee.

27:38.382 --> 27:41.154
A license is an agreement
you enter with the government

27:41.221 --> 27:43.826
to let them have control
over you.

27:43.893 --> 27:46.765
- The 12th Article of Faith
tells us to obey, honor,

27:46.832 --> 27:48.769
and sustain the law.

27:48.836 --> 27:50.807
You may be able
to hypnotize your brothers,

27:50.873 --> 27:53.111
but you cannot hypnotize me.

27:54.949 --> 27:57.019
Hands on the rail.

27:57.085 --> 27:59.123
Whilst we live,
we must shame the Devil.

27:59.190 --> 28:01.962
If God spoke to you
and told you

28:02.029 --> 28:03.398
that I was ready to run things,

28:03.465 --> 28:05.736
don't you think you owe me
that chance?

28:08.609 --> 28:09.812
- Hands on the rail.

28:09.878 --> 28:12.116
To be clear,

28:12.182 --> 28:16.391
your grandpa gave Dan lashings
in front of everyone?

28:16.458 --> 28:17.293
Like, real ones?

28:17.359 --> 28:18.730
Or were they just playing
around?

28:20.198 --> 28:22.671
<i>It was real.
I saw the blood.</i>

28:28.849 --> 28:30.587
That's enough.
That's enough.

28:30.653 --> 28:32.490
There's children here.

28:32.558 --> 28:34.026
There's kids here.

28:35.730 --> 28:37.567
- There's only room
for one patriarch

28:37.634 --> 28:38.902
in the family.

28:43.111 --> 28:45.349
You give me back my belt.

28:45.415 --> 28:47.788
Oh, you're a big boy now?

28:51.494 --> 28:53.932
So let's settle this
like Lafferty men.

28:59.512 --> 29:01.715
Come on, Ronnie.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.653
Come on, Ron.

29:18.315 --> 29:19.751
- Need any help,
Brother Lafferty?

29:19.818 --> 29:21.922
<i>I think we've got it
covered, Sister Wright.</i>

29:21.989 --> 29:23.525
<i>See you in there.</i>

29:27.132 --> 29:28.803
You want to hurt me?

29:28.869 --> 29:32.476
It's making your ears ring,
just like when you were a boy.

29:35.215 --> 29:38.856
You got anger in your eye.

29:39.825 --> 29:42.229
It's a dangerous defect.

29:42.296 --> 29:45.970
Now, you count to ten,
like I taught you.

29:47.139 --> 29:49.878
One.
- Eh.

29:49.945 --> 29:51.749
Two.

29:51.816 --> 29:55.088
It's okay.
We'll put the--

29:55.155 --> 29:57.527
put the cans on the back
of the truck there, huh?

29:57.593 --> 30:00.432
<i>So is
your grandpa the leader, then?</i>

30:01.400 --> 30:04.039
<i>No, ma'am.
Uncle Dan and Aunt Matilda</i>

30:04.106 --> 30:06.512
<i>had a party
in the room the next morning.</i>

30:06.578 --> 30:09.083
<i>That's when
heavenly Father chose.</i>

30:09.150 --> 30:11.522
I got her! I got her!
I got her! I got her!

30:11.589 --> 30:13.559
I got her. Okay.

30:13.626 --> 30:15.563
Okay.

30:15.629 --> 30:17.165
- Prayer time, is it?
- Prayer time?

30:17.232 --> 30:20.138
We need our Lord's wisdom.

30:21.474 --> 30:23.411
Okay.

30:23.478 --> 30:24.848
Oh.

30:24.914 --> 30:27.153
Our dear heavenly Father,

30:27.219 --> 30:32.295
we ask that Thou would take
away my own personal desires.

30:33.766 --> 30:36.237
Show me Thy path.

30:36.303 --> 30:41.181
I will do anything
and go anywhere...

30:41.247 --> 30:43.686
to be worthy of Thy wisdom.

30:46.223 --> 30:49.597
I will do anything
and go anywhere.

30:51.902 --> 30:55.543
I will do anything
and go anywhere.

30:57.780 --> 31:01.789
I will do anything
and go anywhere.

31:01.856 --> 31:03.325
- I will do anything
and go anywhere.

31:03.392 --> 31:06.264
- I will do anything
and go anywhere.

31:06.330 --> 31:09.070
I will do anything
and go anywhere.

31:09.136 --> 31:11.441
I will do anything
and go anywhere!

31:11.508 --> 31:14.113
I will do anything
and go anywhere!

31:14.179 --> 31:16.418
I will do anything
and go anywhere!

31:16.484 --> 31:19.023
I will do anything
and go anywhere!

31:19.089 --> 31:21.528
I will do anything
and go anywhere!

31:21.595 --> 31:23.231
- I feel it, Lord! Yes!

31:23.297 --> 31:26.605
I feel it burning inside of me
to lead us!

31:26.672 --> 31:28.408
I accept Thy will, oh Father!

31:28.474 --> 31:30.412
I accept Thy will,
heavenly Father!

31:30.478 --> 31:31.581
I accept!

31:34.353 --> 31:36.826
- Jenny...

31:36.892 --> 31:41.701
Did you see Aunt Brenda
or Uncle Allen that morning?

31:41.768 --> 31:44.039
- The last time I saw her,

31:44.106 --> 31:48.114
she was alone outside her room,
and all in black.

31:48.181 --> 31:50.386
Black what?

31:50.452 --> 31:51.989
- A black robe.

31:52.055 --> 31:53.659
Why was she wearing that?

31:53.725 --> 31:55.596
I don't know.
I don't know.

31:55.663 --> 31:58.501
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay.

31:58.569 --> 31:59.838
It's gonna be okay.

32:07.787 --> 32:09.891
I'm so glad
you were able to make it,

32:09.958 --> 32:11.962
Brother and Sister Pyre.

32:12.029 --> 32:13.566
Come in. Come in.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.135
Why don't you two
take the middle seats

32:15.201 --> 32:16.972
between your parents?

32:21.013 --> 32:22.951
Haven't your parents done

32:23.018 --> 32:26.123
a magnificent job
with you both?

32:27.326 --> 32:28.361
And now that you've
turned eight,

32:28.428 --> 32:31.133
the time has come
for your baptism.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.039
When your father baptizes you,

32:34.106 --> 32:37.446
all of your old sins
will be washed away.

32:37.514 --> 32:41.454
But from then on, any new sins
are yours to repent.

32:41.522 --> 32:43.893
Now, that is
a big responsibility,

32:43.960 --> 32:45.162
being so grown up.

32:45.229 --> 32:46.866
But I know you can do it,
can't you?

32:46.932 --> 32:48.301
Yes, sir.

32:48.368 --> 32:50.839
- Now, I need to ask you
a few questions first, okay?

32:50.906 --> 32:52.744
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

32:52.810 --> 32:56.619
First, have you both paid
your full and complete tithe?

32:56.685 --> 33:00.025
Now, that means you've taken
10% of any allowance or gifts

33:00.092 --> 33:01.962
and given that to the church.

33:02.029 --> 33:03.464
Annie, you first.

33:03.532 --> 33:04.668
- Yes, Bishop.

33:04.735 --> 33:06.872
Great.
And how about you, Caroline?

33:06.939 --> 33:08.341
- Yes, Bishop.

33:08.408 --> 33:12.282
Next,
and this is very important...

33:14.319 --> 33:17.259
Do you believe
this is the one true church

33:17.326 --> 33:19.731
on the face of our planet,

33:19.798 --> 33:24.207
that Heavenly Father sent
His only son as our savior,

33:24.273 --> 33:27.146
and that Joseph Smith
is a true prophet

33:27.212 --> 33:29.449
here to restore His church?

33:29.517 --> 33:30.452
Yes.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.189
- How about one
at a time, please?

33:32.256 --> 33:33.926
Annie?
Yes, Bishop.

33:33.993 --> 33:35.028
And you, Caroline?

33:35.094 --> 33:36.030
Yes, Bishop.

33:36.096 --> 33:37.634
Good. Good.

33:37.701 --> 33:41.976
Anne and Caroline, I very much
look forward to your baptism.

33:42.042 --> 33:43.512
And I understand your mother

33:43.579 --> 33:45.416
has sewn you
the most beautiful dresses.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.754
- Oh. I try my best.

33:47.821 --> 33:49.056
They're wonderful, yeah.

33:50.659 --> 33:52.062
Great job.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.235
- Thanks.
So good to see you.

33:56.739 --> 33:58.709
- So...

33:58.775 --> 34:00.646
how can I help you, Brother?

34:00.713 --> 34:03.552
- Well, there's a couple
of things going on right now.

34:03.619 --> 34:05.656
And, um...

34:05.723 --> 34:06.926
well, one is my mom.

34:06.992 --> 34:08.695
She, um--

34:08.762 --> 34:11.167
so she moved in with us...

34:11.233 --> 34:12.970
almost ten years ago now.

34:13.037 --> 34:15.743
And at that time, Becca and I--

34:15.810 --> 34:18.916
we--we didn't think
we could have kids.

34:21.822 --> 34:25.996
And my brothers already had
eight, ten kids each,

34:26.063 --> 34:28.334
and so I--

34:28.401 --> 34:31.875
we--we gladly, you know,
took her in, and--

34:31.941 --> 34:33.444
even though I was the baby.

34:33.512 --> 34:36.350
But, um, couple years ago,

34:36.417 --> 34:42.663
she--my mom--she started
to show signs, um...

34:43.999 --> 34:45.970
- Of dementia.

34:46.036 --> 34:47.807
Yes, Brother, I know.

34:50.145 --> 34:51.413
Sorry.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.854
She stopped being able
to sleep at night.

34:57.159 --> 35:00.165
And, um...

35:00.232 --> 35:01.467
she doesn't know
the difference

35:01.535 --> 35:03.238
between her nightmares
and what's real,

35:03.304 --> 35:06.177
and, um, she gets--
she gets angry.

35:06.244 --> 35:09.282
She gets very anxious.
And...

35:10.519 --> 35:12.890
- You worry
you can't pass this test.

35:12.957 --> 35:15.596
- No.
No, I don't.

35:17.166 --> 35:19.302
It's more that...

35:22.676 --> 35:25.449
The other night, she had
this really clear moment.

35:25.516 --> 35:27.219
Just--

35:27.286 --> 35:29.991
She was right there,
just like the old days.

35:30.058 --> 35:32.664
Like my mom was back, you know?
And she says to me

35:32.730 --> 35:35.368
that she doesn't want
to be here anymore.

35:37.072 --> 35:39.276
She's in so much pain, Bishop.

35:39.343 --> 35:42.717
And all the pain she's in,
what do--what do we...

35:44.053 --> 35:45.856
What do I--what do I do?

35:49.865 --> 35:54.239
- To in any way help...

35:54.306 --> 35:57.446
abbreviate a life...

35:57.514 --> 36:00.118
is to interfere
with Heavenly Father's plan.

36:00.185 --> 36:01.889
- Of course.

36:01.955 --> 36:04.093
- Now, this life is a test,

36:04.160 --> 36:06.899
and the challenges
put before us

36:06.965 --> 36:08.301
are not to be avoided.

36:08.368 --> 36:10.471
They are to be overcome.

36:10.539 --> 36:11.775
- Yes.
- Hmm?

36:11.842 --> 36:14.413
- Yeah.
- But...

36:14.480 --> 36:17.285
medication is not
looked down upon by the Lord.

36:17.352 --> 36:20.325
Antidepressants,
antipsychotics.

36:20.392 --> 36:22.262
It's a fact.

36:23.465 --> 36:28.040
Women struggle more
with feelings than men.

36:28.975 --> 36:31.948
Many of the women in this very
congregation take medication

36:32.015 --> 36:35.288
on a daily basis
to help with their feelings.

36:36.491 --> 36:40.700
Heavenly Father created
pharmacology to help us,

36:40.767 --> 36:44.540
and trust me,
I've seen it work.

36:46.310 --> 36:48.280
- Thank you.
Thank you, Bishop.

36:51.220 --> 36:54.827
The second thing is, um...

36:57.232 --> 36:59.403
It's this case
that I'm working on.

36:59.470 --> 37:00.740
This--this will stay
between us.

37:00.806 --> 37:03.578
- Of course.
- Sorry. I don't mean to--

37:03.645 --> 37:05.516
It's a double murder case.

37:07.318 --> 37:11.127
And so far, what we've found

37:11.193 --> 37:14.567
isn't pointing outward...

37:16.137 --> 37:18.141
If you know what I mean.

37:18.208 --> 37:21.848
Most--most of the evidence
so far...

37:21.915 --> 37:24.621
points inward,

37:24.687 --> 37:27.492
towards the early days
of our people,

37:27.560 --> 37:32.937
to beliefs that I...

37:33.003 --> 37:36.979
only ever heard whispers of.

37:37.045 --> 37:39.449
- Be frank with me, Brother.

37:39.517 --> 37:41.855
- One of the suspect's wives...

37:43.725 --> 37:46.932
She used a term,
"blood atonement,"

37:46.998 --> 37:50.038
saying that some sins
were so wicked

37:50.105 --> 37:54.514
that the only way one could...

37:54.581 --> 37:55.983
be cleansed of them

37:56.050 --> 37:58.254
is by spilling

37:58.321 --> 38:00.693
the--the sinner's blood
on the ground.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.730
And she said that these ideas

38:02.797 --> 38:05.870
came from the words
of our prophets.

38:05.936 --> 38:07.606
- What are you asking me?

38:07.673 --> 38:12.516
- I guess I'm asking, could
such things be a part of us,

38:12.583 --> 38:15.656
from--from our--our past,
or today?

38:17.593 --> 38:19.797
- Brother Pyre,
I'm not an academic,

38:19.864 --> 38:22.704
nor am I trained
as a historian,

38:22.770 --> 38:28.247
and so I never concern myself
with such deep dives.

38:28.314 --> 38:30.051
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

38:30.118 --> 38:32.222
- No, I'm not sure I do.

38:35.328 --> 38:37.633
- I don't go digging
in the past...

38:39.303 --> 38:41.039
And neither should you.

38:42.409 --> 38:44.346
You place your trust
in today's prophet,

38:44.413 --> 38:47.553
Spencer W. Kimball.

38:47.619 --> 38:49.924
You leave the things
you do not understand

38:49.991 --> 38:52.630
on a shelf.

38:52.697 --> 38:57.472
And you trust that the prophet
will never lead us astray.

39:13.739 --> 39:15.776
Are the girls asleep?

39:19.016 --> 39:20.185
What about your mom?

39:20.252 --> 39:21.688
She's fine.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.398
- Hey, um...

39:28.769 --> 39:31.107
What did, uh, the bishop say?

39:31.173 --> 39:33.077
- Same old, antipsychotics.

39:34.614 --> 39:36.585
I just still--I...

39:36.651 --> 39:39.389
I get these moments with her,
Becca,

39:39.456 --> 39:42.295
these moments of real clarity,

39:42.362 --> 39:45.034
and--and--
and she's still there

39:45.101 --> 39:48.875
when we go for a walk
or when we talk at night.

39:48.942 --> 39:51.848
And I'm just concerned
that these medications

39:51.915 --> 39:55.154
are just gonna...

39:55.221 --> 39:58.127
take away anything that's left.

40:01.668 --> 40:04.239
- You know it's temporary.

40:04.306 --> 40:07.880
In the Celestial Kingdom,
you'll have her back,

40:07.946 --> 40:09.583
restored.

40:11.621 --> 40:13.424
Of course.

40:17.633 --> 40:20.004
I've been thinking, um...

40:20.071 --> 40:21.340
- Warned you about that.

40:21.406 --> 40:24.045
- Oh. Oh, no.

40:27.452 --> 40:30.024
I think it's wise if we
postpone the girls' baptisms.

40:31.226 --> 40:33.163
- Wh-why?

40:33.230 --> 40:36.037
- This--this--this case.

40:36.103 --> 40:38.474
I--I need to just get
this case behind me

40:38.541 --> 40:39.977
so I can clear my head

40:40.044 --> 40:43.585
and so that my heart
can--can be fully in it.

40:46.591 --> 40:49.096
But, I mean, my--

40:49.162 --> 40:51.835
my parents are coming
from Arizona.

40:52.770 --> 40:55.007
And our congregation.
It wouldn't go unnoticed.

40:55.074 --> 40:56.010
It's highly unusual.

40:56.077 --> 40:57.378
- You don't think
I'm aware of that?

40:57.445 --> 40:58.515
- People will think
that our girls

40:58.582 --> 41:00.820
failed their interview.

41:00.886 --> 41:03.726
It will be humiliating
for them, for us.

41:03.792 --> 41:07.332
It's not just our congregation,
it's our neighbors,

41:07.399 --> 41:09.504
our friends.

41:09.571 --> 41:11.541
I have waited
my whole life for this.

41:11.607 --> 41:16.383
I have worked so hard
to make it perfect.

41:16.450 --> 41:17.754
- I assure you, I--
- Don't--

41:17.820 --> 41:19.423
- I've prayed on this.
- Just don't do this to me...

41:19.490 --> 41:21.159
- Becca...
- And them.

41:22.395 --> 41:24.867
- The decision's been made.

41:24.934 --> 41:27.840
And as our priesthood holder,

41:27.907 --> 41:29.810
I need you
to back me up on this.

41:29.877 --> 41:31.915
And I am not asking.
- That old chestnut.

41:31.982 --> 41:33.217
- I would rather not have to.

41:33.284 --> 41:35.121
You know what?
You're right.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.691
You're right.

41:45.676 --> 41:47.513
Stop staring at me.

41:54.492 --> 41:55.929
Stop.

42:02.643 --> 42:03.545
- You know what, Jeb?

42:03.612 --> 42:05.849
- What?

42:05.916 --> 42:07.854
- I acknowledge and accept

42:07.920 --> 42:10.191
that you are indeed
the man of this house,

42:10.257 --> 42:14.199
and as such,
you are our priesthood holder.

42:14.266 --> 42:17.238
But don't you ever forget,

42:17.305 --> 42:20.478
it's me who chooses when

42:20.545 --> 42:24.085
or if I ever hold
your priesthood again.

42:31.568 --> 42:33.337
- Come here.

42:41.153 --> 42:43.691
- Whoa.

42:43.758 --> 42:45.328
Honey, honey, honey.
I have to go back to work.

42:45.395 --> 42:46.731
- Don't you dare.

42:46.798 --> 42:49.704
- In the name of Jesus Christ.

42:59.189 --> 43:00.626
He will slice
your throats from ear to ear

43:00.692 --> 43:02.061
to cleanse you.

43:02.128 --> 43:04.601
I hear his voice.

43:04.667 --> 43:07.539
He wants this world back!

43:07.606 --> 43:08.975
Hang in there.

43:25.107 --> 43:26.309
- Sheesh.

43:31.086 --> 43:33.525
Open to the Lord's
interpretation!

43:33.592 --> 43:35.328
- How much longer?
- 30 minutes.

43:35.394 --> 43:36.631
- Let's--

43:36.698 --> 43:40.271
Open to the Lord's
interpretation!

43:57.138 --> 43:58.609
- Sam?

43:58.676 --> 44:00.077
Mm-hmm.

44:03.752 --> 44:05.922
- Do you think he had--

44:07.292 --> 44:08.929
That he had anything
to do with this?

44:08.996 --> 44:10.799
- I just feel like I should be
asking you that, Allen.

44:10.866 --> 44:12.936
Never again!

44:14.105 --> 44:16.143
Saw your police record.

44:16.945 --> 44:19.950
You were arrested the morning
after your wedding?

44:20.017 --> 44:22.022
And then you earned yourself
a contempt of court charge?

44:22.088 --> 44:25.161
You know, for a second there,
Allen, just for a second,

44:25.228 --> 44:27.833
I really felt
like we were on the same team.

44:32.509 --> 44:36.584
- Uh, I--I didn't think
it was consequential.

44:36.651 --> 44:38.589
It's consequential, Allen.

44:38.655 --> 44:42.529
You disobeyed a judge's orders
by recording his hearing.

44:43.865 --> 44:45.936
And you were put
in jail for it.

44:46.003 --> 44:49.309
So that tells me...

44:49.375 --> 44:51.615
maybe you and Sam
are on the same team.

44:51.681 --> 44:52.883
- No, I--

44:52.950 --> 44:55.622
So what else
are you not telling me?

44:57.859 --> 44:59.395
Who else are you protecting?

44:59.462 --> 45:04.439
- Brenda and I--
we planned our wedding, um,

45:04.507 --> 45:09.082
for the day before she was due
to graduate from BYU

45:09.149 --> 45:13.224
so that her family
could do both in one trip.

45:13.291 --> 45:17.332
I--I was on my way
to buy her some flowers.

45:17.399 --> 45:18.669
I'll have to take you
downtown.

45:18.735 --> 45:19.937
Get out of the car, please.

45:20.004 --> 45:22.074
<i>But my brothers
had pushed me</i>

45:22.141 --> 45:25.014
into refusing to pay
traffic fines.

45:25.081 --> 45:28.922
<i>They said it went
against separation of powers.</i>

45:29.791 --> 45:34.366
Brenda was angry that I had put
my brothers ahead of her,

45:34.432 --> 45:36.169
<i>ahead of us.</i>

45:37.371 --> 45:39.610
So she confronted Dan.

45:42.616 --> 45:47.024
- This country is in shambles,
and it needs our help.

45:47.826 --> 45:51.366
And it starts by resisting
illegal taxes.

45:51.433 --> 45:54.306
That's federal income tax,
traffic fines.

45:54.372 --> 45:57.244
You see, we must start to break
these unlawful rules

45:57.311 --> 45:58.648
in order to challenge them now,

45:58.715 --> 46:01.353
because we cannot get a tax
lawsuit through the court

46:01.419 --> 46:04.627
fast enough in order to save
our businesses and our homes.

46:04.694 --> 46:07.566
- Okay, but they say if Allen
doesn't pay the tickets,

46:07.633 --> 46:09.336
they'll impound his truck.

46:09.403 --> 46:12.141
I mean, your--your dad
helped him get that truck.

46:12.208 --> 46:14.345
- Does it scare you to think
that Allen

46:14.412 --> 46:18.086
might disappoint Father, say,
more than disappoint me?

46:19.355 --> 46:20.491
Or us?

46:21.561 --> 46:23.130
- Are we still talking
about tickets?

46:23.197 --> 46:24.433
- The truth is absolute,
Brenda.

46:24.499 --> 46:26.203
We cannot decide,
for convenience sake,

46:26.270 --> 46:27.540
when we're going to honor it.

46:27.606 --> 46:28.809
- That's right.

46:28.875 --> 46:30.378
- And if a traffic cop

46:30.444 --> 46:32.683
is acting as law enforcement,
judge, and jury,

46:32.750 --> 46:35.054
then Allen's fines
must not be paid.

46:35.120 --> 46:38.494
And if a tax defies
the original U.S. Constitution,

46:38.561 --> 46:40.398
it must not be paid either.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.303
Obeying unholy laws
for Daddy's sake

46:43.370 --> 46:45.041
is not going to make
anybody happy,

46:45.108 --> 46:46.777
not here or in the next life.

46:46.844 --> 46:48.849
- Okay, but, I mean,

46:48.916 --> 46:50.384
there's gotta be a way
to do it

46:50.451 --> 46:52.121
where we won't
all have to go to jail.

46:52.188 --> 46:53.958
- Your husband
made his decision.

46:54.025 --> 46:55.996
Honor your priesthood holder.

47:09.891 --> 47:13.230
Brenda, I can assure you

47:13.297 --> 47:15.134
that if Allen gets arrested
again,

47:15.201 --> 47:16.971
he will not go to jail.

47:17.038 --> 47:19.610
- No?
Why not?

47:19.677 --> 47:21.413
- Dan's getting on the ballot.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.150
He'll be more powerful
than any judge.

47:23.216 --> 47:24.386
- Yep.

47:24.453 --> 47:25.789
- For what office?

47:25.856 --> 47:28.895
- For sheriff.
I had a vision about it.

47:28.962 --> 47:30.832
- Sheriff of what?

47:32.837 --> 47:34.405
Before we settled here,

47:34.472 --> 47:36.912
our ancestors sought refuge
in Missouri.

47:36.978 --> 47:38.180
- Yeah, I know.

47:38.247 --> 47:40.886
And did you also know
that one day,

47:40.953 --> 47:43.157
without reason, without cause,

47:43.224 --> 47:45.127
U.S. Government troops
appeared out of the woods,

47:45.194 --> 47:46.865
and they fired
on our ancestors,

47:46.931 --> 47:49.069
and we sought refuge
in a log cabin?

47:49.136 --> 47:51.140
- Yeah, I know.
Everyone knows.

47:51.206 --> 47:53.512
- Joseph Smith loved,

47:53.578 --> 47:57.485
loved, the Constitution
more than he loved revenge.

47:57.553 --> 48:00.491
And so, after heavenly Father
helped him escape from prison,

48:00.559 --> 48:03.732
he was called on
to help protect our people,

48:03.798 --> 48:05.669
to help protect
our Constitution,

48:05.735 --> 48:09.577
by running for the presidency
of the United States.

48:09.644 --> 48:12.248
And that is simply
all that I'm doing.

48:12.315 --> 48:14.485
I'm just following
in his footsteps.

48:15.923 --> 48:18.928
If a sheriff can convene
common law jury,

48:18.995 --> 48:21.768
and court is where we are
ultimately headed,

48:21.834 --> 48:23.170
then imagine how helpful
it will be

48:23.237 --> 48:25.608
when I have become the courts.

48:28.447 --> 48:30.351
- So you just get rid
of the 16th Amendment.

48:30.418 --> 48:32.923
- Yeah.
- No more federal taxes.

48:32.989 --> 48:34.560
- No.
- Okay.

48:34.627 --> 48:37.498
And, um--and what about
the other amendments?

48:38.768 --> 48:41.006
- Well, after the first ten,
yeah, they all go.

48:41.073 --> 48:43.612
All?
The 13th, too?

48:43.678 --> 48:44.614
Slavery's back?

48:44.681 --> 48:46.450
I mean--

48:46.517 --> 48:48.688
It all sounds pretty crazy,
if you ask me.

48:48.755 --> 48:50.525
- But he didn't ask you!

48:50.592 --> 48:52.328
And he wouldn't!

48:52.395 --> 48:54.165
So if I was you,
I would keep my mouth shut

48:54.232 --> 48:56.169
till I'd done my research
if you don't want to sound

48:56.235 --> 48:59.242
like an idiot
in front of your new family.

49:00.411 --> 49:02.481
<i>You know,
a lot of LDS husbands</i>

49:02.549 --> 49:05.054
<i>might have been mad at her
for intervening.</i>

49:05.120 --> 49:08.628
But, you know, Brenda was--

49:08.695 --> 49:11.700
she was trying to protect me
from going astray.

49:14.038 --> 49:18.013
Our wives often see us

49:18.080 --> 49:21.320
much clearer
than we can see ourselves.

49:21.386 --> 49:23.725
Don't you find that
with your wife?

49:23.791 --> 49:25.094
- All the time.

49:25.161 --> 49:28.266
And so did Emma,
Joseph's wife.

49:29.637 --> 49:32.041
- Joseph. Joseph.

49:33.443 --> 49:36.383
Perhaps the Lord provides
a bounty of new saints,

49:36.450 --> 49:37.820
that we may raise up an army.

49:37.886 --> 49:39.356
- Don't be foolish, Brigham.

49:39.422 --> 49:41.459
What Gentile would sell us
armaments in such quantity

49:41.527 --> 49:42.897
that we might win such a fight?

49:42.963 --> 49:44.365
- A rifle aimed by God

49:44.432 --> 49:48.006
will beat back 100
of their arms, Sister Smith.

49:48.073 --> 49:50.144
Brigham.
Do we build a Zion on Earth

49:50.210 --> 49:51.947
<i>for our pleasure?</i>

49:52.014 --> 49:53.985
For power?

49:54.052 --> 49:56.189
Revenge? Bloodshed?

49:57.559 --> 49:58.628
Enough.

49:58.694 --> 50:01.232
But after Joseph
escaped jail

50:01.299 --> 50:04.807
and avoided execution
in Missouri,

50:04.873 --> 50:07.445
he started to sound more
and more like Brigham.

50:07.513 --> 50:11.319
We must strengthen
our army...

50:13.525 --> 50:16.697
That it might prove worthy
of our Heavenly Father.

50:18.300 --> 50:20.805
For if blood must be spilt,

50:20.872 --> 50:25.414
let it be theirs, and not ours.

50:25.481 --> 50:27.819
- And Emma was right,
wasn't she?

50:27.886 --> 50:29.355
- I don't--that's enough, okay?

50:29.422 --> 50:31.660
- I mean, wasn't it Joseph's
turn toward aggression

50:31.727 --> 50:35.635
that gave birth to our
very first destroying angel?

50:37.205 --> 50:38.908
<i>Isn't that how
the Missouri governor</i>

50:38.975 --> 50:40.512
<i>got filled up with lead?</i>

50:43.150 --> 50:44.352
- I don't want to hear it.

50:44.418 --> 50:46.256
All right?
I don't want to hear it.

50:47.526 --> 50:49.295
- They got to you, didn't they?

50:49.362 --> 50:51.199
How high up they go?

50:52.135 --> 50:53.504
Bishop?

50:54.707 --> 50:56.242
Stake president?

50:57.211 --> 50:58.781
The office of the president?

51:00.885 --> 51:04.660
Did they tell you to "put
your questions on the shelf"?

51:12.509 --> 51:14.278
- Let's get back on track.

51:15.715 --> 51:18.722
Did you do anything
to try to heal this rift

51:18.788 --> 51:21.193
between your brothers
and your wife?

51:21.260 --> 51:23.030
With Sam, maybe?

51:23.096 --> 51:24.667
- Yes.
- Okay.

51:24.734 --> 51:28.406
- More than anything,
I--I wanted Brenda to be happy.

51:31.079 --> 51:34.954
So I offered her what,
at the time,

51:35.020 --> 51:38.293
I felt was
a significant sacrifice.

51:40.632 --> 51:45.541
Look, if God's plan
for--for this life

51:45.608 --> 51:50.585
is for us to build up
an eternal family,

51:50.651 --> 51:52.789
and...

51:52.856 --> 51:57.532
you want me
to give up most of mine...

51:57.599 --> 52:00.137
then I'm gonna need
something from you.

52:02.241 --> 52:08.755
I'm gonna need to know that you
want us to start a new family,

52:08.821 --> 52:10.323
one of our own.

52:11.359 --> 52:13.597
And so that we'll be able
to do that,

52:13.664 --> 52:17.204
I--I think both of us need
to give up a few things first.

52:20.444 --> 52:22.348
- You don't want me
to take that job, do you?

52:22.415 --> 52:26.023
- I just think it'll take up
too much of your energy.

52:26.089 --> 52:28.460
- It's...

52:28.527 --> 52:29.897
It's Channel 11 News.

52:29.964 --> 52:32.168
- Look, let's--you know,

52:32.235 --> 52:35.307
let's have a bunch of babies.

52:35.374 --> 52:38.280
And then
you can be a newscaster.

52:38.346 --> 52:39.583
You have your degree.

52:39.650 --> 52:41.920
People are always gonna
want to hire you.

52:43.525 --> 52:47.198
Okay? And then--
and then I'll do like Ron.

52:47.264 --> 52:48.434
Okay?

52:48.500 --> 52:49.903
I'll leave my brothers
to it themselves.

52:55.949 --> 53:01.192
<i>Our sweet wives
all being told that</i>

53:01.259 --> 53:03.698
by having dozens of children,

53:03.765 --> 53:07.338
that would somehow make them
more holy,

53:07.404 --> 53:09.676
more righteous.

53:09.743 --> 53:11.647
Lately, I've started to wonder,

53:11.714 --> 53:15.421
isn't that
just another surrender

53:15.487 --> 53:18.962
that we push them into
in the name of God?

53:19.028 --> 53:22.569
And I certainly didn't see it
like that at the time.

53:24.105 --> 53:27.513
You know, that I was building
Brenda a new cage,

53:27.579 --> 53:29.148
a prison.

53:35.227 --> 53:36.530
But I was.

53:38.133 --> 53:39.636
Wasn't I?

53:51.828 --> 53:54.867
- Hey, Sam.
How you doing?

53:54.933 --> 53:58.373
Once again, I'm Detective Pyre.
This is Investigator Taba.

53:58.440 --> 54:01.246
- I am the Lord God of Israel's
chosen servant,

54:01.312 --> 54:05.421
my soul sent to Earth in these
latter days to earn a body,

54:05.487 --> 54:08.661
these hands, this strength,

54:08.728 --> 54:11.132
to separate the wheat
from the tares.

54:11.199 --> 54:12.636
- So we've heard.

54:12.703 --> 54:15.273
Tell me,
what kind of chosen one

54:15.340 --> 54:18.581
cuts the throat
of a 15-month-old?

54:20.384 --> 54:21.820
Hmm?

54:23.323 --> 54:26.162
- Heaven calls
its destroying angels.

54:26.229 --> 54:28.634
I am thee,

54:28.701 --> 54:32.141
sent to spill the blood
of those on His list

54:32.208 --> 54:34.746
onto the ground.
- There's a list?

54:34.813 --> 54:35.982
A holy list,

54:36.049 --> 54:38.888
revealed to Heavenly Father's
destroying angels.

54:40.324 --> 54:42.595
I've heard his voice.
And now, I--

54:42.662 --> 54:44.533
- Wait, wait, wait, Sam.

54:46.036 --> 54:49.175
You're saying there's--
there's an actual list.

54:49.242 --> 54:50.745
Is that right?

54:52.081 --> 54:53.517
Who all's on it?

54:54.653 --> 54:58.861
- The fornicator Brenda,
wicked and defiant.

54:58.928 --> 55:00.698
Her spawn Erica,

55:00.765 --> 55:03.369
the rotten fruit
of fornication.

55:03.436 --> 55:04.906
Heavenly Father demanded

55:04.973 --> 55:07.177
their blood
be spilled to the ground.

55:07.244 --> 55:09.950
It has been done.

55:10.017 --> 55:11.352
- Fornication?

55:11.419 --> 55:16.597
As in sexual relations with
someone other than her husband.

55:17.833 --> 55:19.101
- What?

55:22.074 --> 55:25.047
Did--did she?
- Well, you said it, not me.

55:25.114 --> 55:27.752
- Not that fornication.

55:29.254 --> 55:32.395
She disobeyed her husband...

55:32.461 --> 55:34.633
and me

55:34.699 --> 55:37.772
and God's chosen men.

55:37.839 --> 55:41.546
That's fornication.
That's fornication!

55:41.613 --> 55:43.784
- Ever hear of that definition?

55:43.851 --> 55:45.053
- Mm-mm.

55:46.691 --> 55:48.661
Sam, who else is on this list?

55:48.728 --> 55:51.065
- It's not given
that you should know.

55:52.368 --> 55:54.840
- So apart from you, uh...

55:54.907 --> 55:57.411
who are the other
destroying angels?

55:57.478 --> 55:59.448
- Ask ye of God, not me.

55:59.516 --> 56:00.752
- What about the man

56:00.819 --> 56:03.156
that ran from your cabin
into the forest?

56:04.258 --> 56:05.662
- Ask ye of God, not me.

56:05.729 --> 56:07.498
- All right.
All right, tell me this.

56:07.565 --> 56:09.369
Uh, where are the rest
of your brothers?

56:09.436 --> 56:11.439
Where's Dan?

56:12.509 --> 56:14.278
And Ron and Jacob?

56:16.951 --> 56:17.986
Are they okay?

56:21.492 --> 56:23.831
Or were they on your list, too?
Were their wives on your list?

56:23.897 --> 56:27.705
- The list is God's! Idiot!

56:27.772 --> 56:31.145
How should I know
how dang long He wants it?

56:31.212 --> 56:34.586
Yeah, I've done my work.

56:34.653 --> 56:37.559
I feel His love and glory now.

56:37.626 --> 56:40.263
I don't need yours.

56:40.330 --> 56:41.701
Hey!

56:41.767 --> 56:44.506
Pyre!
Pyre, get in here!

56:44.573 --> 56:46.175
- Be right back, Sam.
Thank you.

56:46.242 --> 56:48.881
Hey, Pyre! Pyre!

56:51.587 --> 56:53.524
- I'm sorry, did we wake you?

56:53.591 --> 56:55.227
Is all that true?

56:57.532 --> 56:58.834
Is that true?

56:58.901 --> 57:02.174
Are Brenda and my niece Erica--
are they dead?

57:04.011 --> 57:05.213
- You tell us.

57:07.284 --> 57:08.554
- You know I'm not an idiot.

57:08.621 --> 57:09.889
I know
what you're doing in there.

57:09.956 --> 57:12.929
I know that you're in there,
trying to--

57:12.995 --> 57:14.632
trying to take advantage
of my little brother,

57:14.699 --> 57:17.004
trying to trick him
into a false confession.

57:17.071 --> 57:19.241
I see you.
I know what you're doing.

57:19.308 --> 57:21.146
- Robin, he's awful eager.

57:21.212 --> 57:22.280
We hardly said a word.

57:22.347 --> 57:24.152
- Yeah, well,
given his current mental state,

57:24.218 --> 57:26.790
none of what he says in there
will ever hold up in court,

57:26.857 --> 57:30.030
and you know that,
so you tell me.

57:30.097 --> 57:34.606
Tell me right now,
are Brenda and Erica okay?

57:48.934 --> 57:53.778
- That's
a masterful performance, Robin.

57:53.844 --> 57:56.249
- You can go to hell.

57:56.316 --> 57:57.919
- Not very LDS, Brother.

57:59.088 --> 58:01.359
We call it outer darkness,
last I checked.

58:20.397 --> 58:21.800
No.

58:25.541 --> 58:26.911
- Hey!

58:26.977 --> 58:28.379
Spilling your blood
on my floor...

58:28.446 --> 58:29.616
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

58:29.682 --> 58:31.218
Won't cleanse you
of anything.

58:32.254 --> 58:34.860
On my life...

58:36.864 --> 58:39.903
On my family's lives,
I had no part in this.

58:50.390 --> 58:52.528
- What about Sam?
- I don't understand.

58:52.595 --> 58:55.000
I don't...

58:55.067 --> 58:56.904
I don't know how things
could have turned to this.

58:56.970 --> 59:00.344
It's not... possible.

59:00.411 --> 59:03.851
- Well, it happened.
- Look at their bodies.

59:05.254 --> 59:08.727
We need to know who
and why and now.

59:08.794 --> 59:11.399
- Sam could not have done this.
Please.

59:11.466 --> 59:15.574
- Robin, when you were
with your actual brothers...

59:15.641 --> 59:17.812
did they ever mention
a list of names?

59:21.987 --> 59:26.095
If there was a list...

59:26.161 --> 59:29.268
and if this little girl's name
was on it...

59:36.617 --> 59:38.252
Then there would be
many more names.

59:39.355 --> 59:40.758
- Whose?

59:41.894 --> 59:43.998
Tell me.
- I can't be sure, I--

59:44.065 --> 59:45.634
Robin.

59:47.037 --> 59:49.709
You want me to extend
my trust to you...

59:51.680 --> 59:52.949
Give me names.

59:57.091 --> 59:58.326
- The Lows.

1:00:01.533 --> 1:00:04.304
And--and the Stowes.

1:00:06.175 --> 1:00:09.683
Our bishop
and our stake president

1:00:09.750 --> 1:00:11.285
and their wives.

1:00:12.755 --> 1:00:17.364
- Why them?
- Sam was angry... with them.

1:00:17.431 --> 1:00:21.306
They--they tried to intervene
in my brothers' research

1:00:21.372 --> 1:00:26.683
into original LDS teachings
and documents,

1:00:26.750 --> 1:00:29.756
into...

1:00:29.823 --> 1:00:33.697
our past, Brother Pyre.

1:00:39.877 --> 1:00:41.680
- Hey. Hey.

1:00:41.747 --> 1:00:43.751
Get my car fueled,
vests on seats.

1:00:43.818 --> 1:00:45.054
Call in Gray and Peters.

1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:47.491
I need them to get to
Stake President Stowe's home,

1:00:47.559 --> 1:00:48.795
pronto.

1:00:48.861 --> 1:00:51.399
And get me an address
for a Bishop Low.

1:01:07.698 --> 1:01:11.272
<i>And I certainly didn't
see it like that at the time.</i>

1:01:12.942 --> 1:01:16.148
You know, that I was building
Brenda a new cage...

1:01:18.386 --> 1:01:19.622
<i>A prison.</i>

1:01:29.943 --> 1:01:32.782
<i>And after
I had locked her in there,</i>

1:01:32.849 --> 1:01:35.621
<i>once she became pregnant,</i>

1:01:35.688 --> 1:01:38.025
<i>her heart changed shape.</i>

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:41.834
<i>I know. </i>

1:01:41.901 --> 1:01:44.037
I know.

1:01:45.273 --> 1:01:47.244
But Dianna...

1:01:47.310 --> 1:01:50.150
I heard the whispering
of the Spirit.

1:01:50.217 --> 1:01:55.260
And... I felt impressed upon,

1:01:55.326 --> 1:01:57.832
that we must do
whatever it takes

1:01:57.899 --> 1:02:00.203
to keep all of our family
together...

1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:04.612
To fight
for each member's exaltation,

1:02:04.679 --> 1:02:06.315
no matter what it takes.

1:02:07.150 --> 1:02:11.527
<i>But I--I'm going to need
your help, Dianna,</i>

1:02:11.593 --> 1:02:15.300
<i>to get them
off this wicked path.</i>
