00:00.010 --> 00:01.580
Previously on Wynonna Earp...

00:01.589 --> 00:03.439
I had no idea what Black Badge

00:03.440 --> 00:04.559
was doing to Dolls and his brothers.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.590
- So what am I supposed to do?
- What does it mean?

00:06.600 --> 00:07.640
Keep going.

00:07.650 --> 00:09.400
- To Dolls.
- I'm starting to think

00:09.420 --> 00:11.659
there was a Cult of
Bulshar survivor once,

00:11.660 --> 00:12.799
and it was me.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.480
Some revenants got into the lizard
drugs Jeremy made for Dolls.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.240
- Call me Katalin.
- Can you just tell me who she is?

00:19.260 --> 00:22.450
- She's my wife.
- I just want you to say my name.

00:22.460 --> 00:23.460
How long have you known

00:23.460 --> 00:24.460
- where she is?
- Mama?

00:24.470 --> 00:25.640
The whole time.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.450
You kept me from my mother for years?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:37.930 --> 00:39.799
This was easier when they came after us.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.060
Oh, you want to stop?

00:41.100 --> 00:43.660
So I carbo-loaded all weekend
for nothing? Nuh. You?

00:43.770 --> 00:46.260
Oh, I could keep this up all night long.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.539
- All night, huh?
- Uh, day. I meant day.

00:49.540 --> 00:52.440
Yeah, well, so could I. I-I got stamina.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.980
Oh!

00:59.780 --> 01:01.740
What a stupid idiot.

01:01.750 --> 01:05.400
Argh! Ah! God, my face!

01:05.500 --> 01:07.690
Aw, sweets. This one?

01:08.360 --> 01:10.260
Goddammit!!

01:10.360 --> 01:12.480
See? Stamina.

01:12.490 --> 01:14.880
- Gah!
- Took him out without breaking a sweat.

01:14.980 --> 01:17.280
Some credit goes to that poplar.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.800
That tree came outta nowhere!
You saw it! It jumped me!

01:19.900 --> 01:22.260
See? This is why you
don't do dragon drugs.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.220
Jacking other people's prescription
can cause hallucinations.

01:25.270 --> 01:26.870
I didn't even take any!

01:27.580 --> 01:29.910
But you stole it. From my friend.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.199
I hear he's dead now anyways.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.200
Whoo. And now so are you.

01:33.580 --> 01:36.020
Make your peace, Franco.

01:40.590 --> 01:42.320
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:48.300 --> 01:51.000
C'mon, baby, don't embarrass
me in front of the bad man.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.630
It's a sign! Take the day off, lady!

01:53.640 --> 01:55.319
I only call in sick during Shark Week.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.860
Doc, would you mind? Just...

01:56.940 --> 01:58.540
shut him up?

01:58.640 --> 02:00.910
Timber.

02:09.949 --> 02:11.850
Even I know this isn't right.

02:19.730 --> 02:22.230
Oh. That's metallic. That's blood.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.780
It's blood.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.940
Oh, my God.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.940
Oh, it's a murder tree.
That's a murder tree.

02:59.770 --> 03:01.769
_

03:01.770 --> 03:03.220
Does it look familiar?

03:03.270 --> 03:07.070
Ah, it's been 20 years
since the forest fire.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.639
Black Badge speak for

03:08.640 --> 03:10.640
"Massacre committed in Bulshar's name."

03:11.810 --> 03:13.760
Oh, did you get rid of his ring yet?

03:14.380 --> 03:15.999
Uh, no. I'm...

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I'm still looking for the perfect spot.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.820
Somewhere where no one
will ever find it.

03:21.390 --> 03:24.930
Yeah, well, I really hope
that's the right thing to do.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.160
Hey, how fast do trees grow?

03:27.930 --> 03:30.100
Slow. Why?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.979
Well, this whole place was

03:31.980 --> 03:33.719
burned to the ground.
I've seen old photographs.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.070
But... these are huge.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.310
Almost like nothing ever happened.

03:39.410 --> 03:43.020
Well, one thing happened: You survived.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.610
I mean, how many six-year-olds
would think to jump in a...

03:46.710 --> 03:48.549
a canoe to escape a fire?

03:48.550 --> 03:49.880
Yeah, but that's just it.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.999
I was already down by the river

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
when something attacked the camp.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.420
I mean, I heard it.

03:58.960 --> 04:03.260
The chaos. The... horrible,
agonized screams.

04:04.230 --> 04:07.419
But... there was no... fire.

04:07.420 --> 04:11.280
There... there wasn't even any smoke.

04:14.140 --> 04:17.019
It's all a lie. BBD burned the evidence.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.250
So I'm just a loose end.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.020
- I just got lucky.
- Hey.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.939
No. Lucky would be not having...

04:25.940 --> 04:29.520
nightmares for 10 years.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.779
Look...

04:32.780 --> 04:35.400
have you ever thought about
talking to your parents?

04:35.420 --> 04:38.540
Yeah. They got fed the official version,

04:38.700 --> 04:41.200
- just like everybody else.
- Would it hurt to ask?

04:41.300 --> 04:42.719
Would it hurt to ask your mom about

04:42.720 --> 04:43.939
the whole not-being-an-Earp thing?

04:43.940 --> 04:46.470
Wow. Nice deflection, Michael Jordan.

04:48.310 --> 04:49.710
Wayne Gretzky?

04:50.160 --> 04:52.150
You really don't do sports, do you?

04:53.680 --> 04:54.859
I'm not...

04:54.860 --> 04:58.420
I'm not ready to do "visiting
my mother in prison." Okay?

04:58.820 --> 05:01.490
- Waves, wait! Come on.
- I see a person!

05:02.290 --> 05:03.490
Uh...

05:04.290 --> 05:06.790
- Robin?
- Waverly!

05:06.890 --> 05:08.260
Oh, girl, you got bangs!

05:08.360 --> 05:10.030
Oh, yeah. Heh.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.839
Uh, so you're back in town...

05:12.840 --> 05:15.780
and a... park ranger?

05:15.800 --> 05:18.470
What? Oh, yeah. Mostly. Heh.

05:19.370 --> 05:21.450
- What up, Red?
- Oh, this is, um...

05:21.460 --> 05:22.880
- Hey.
- ... Officer Haught.

05:22.980 --> 05:24.540
Oh, totally. Super.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.759
Okay, any chance you guys could
take me to see Sheriff Nedley?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.149
I really need to talk to him.

05:28.150 --> 05:31.050
- Uh, where's your truck?
- It's somewhere else.

05:31.150 --> 05:33.540
Okay, c'mon. Let's get you warm.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.290
- Okay. Thanks, Waves.
- That's okay.

05:35.390 --> 05:37.020
Okay. Officer Heat.

05:48.220 --> 05:49.869
Nicole! You got the keys?

05:49.870 --> 05:51.340
Yeah!

05:56.740 --> 05:59.900
Okay, if I can source older
satellite photos of the area

05:59.920 --> 06:02.000
and compare growth patterns
with each type of tree...

06:02.080 --> 06:03.620
Dipshit walking!

06:03.720 --> 06:05.990
Last of the Revenant drug thieves.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.950
Guys? Why bring him here?

06:08.060 --> 06:10.660
Oh. We are plumb outta projectiles.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.990
Gonna sequester him here
till we rustle up some ammo,

06:14.100 --> 06:15.530
then ka-pow!

06:16.560 --> 06:19.770
- Okay, now you do me.
- Maybe once we're alone.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.180
Well, someone ate his
Wheaties this morning.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.270
Or caught up on his beauty sleep.

06:24.370 --> 06:27.739
You look positively effervescent.
Almost glowing.

06:27.740 --> 06:30.280
Ah... I did a seaweed scrubbin'.

06:31.250 --> 06:36.660
So, Deputy Sheriff
Nicole Haught, Esquire,

06:36.740 --> 06:38.499
when were you gonna
tell me that you're the

06:38.500 --> 06:40.800
child survivor of a Cult
of Bulshar massacre?

06:43.260 --> 06:46.260
Which... sucks dong.

06:46.290 --> 06:47.460
Sorry.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.400
But congrats on the living.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.030
No more secrets, remember?

06:54.140 --> 06:56.940
Robin? Hey, how's your dad holdin' up?

06:56.960 --> 07:00.010
He's okay. Uh, Waverly told me
to fill out this paperwork.

07:02.010 --> 07:03.899
This just says, "Woods. Help."

07:03.900 --> 07:05.610
Yeah. Can you?

07:07.680 --> 07:09.699
Uh, Wynonna, wasn't there something that

07:09.700 --> 07:13.600
you didn't tell Waverly
for, I dunno, like, years?

07:14.490 --> 07:16.919
You're right. I should've
been more forthcoming

07:16.920 --> 07:19.699
about the whereabouts
of a certain Michelle,

07:19.700 --> 07:21.459
AKA Mama Gibson.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.260
Thanks for pointing that out. Top-notch.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.300
Okay, can you both agree that
you're sneaky, sneaky squirrels,

07:26.340 --> 07:28.699
and try to have each other's
backs for a change?

07:28.700 --> 07:29.900
Please?

07:32.170 --> 07:33.340
Uh...

07:35.440 --> 07:37.680
We need you. Now more than ever.

07:37.780 --> 07:41.080
And I'm here. Uh, with you.

07:41.140 --> 07:42.179
So...

07:42.180 --> 07:43.959
- Ah!
- Oh, no.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.050
- You're just... Okay, thank you.
- Mwah.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.570
- Oh, boob smoosh.
- Ahem!

07:48.580 --> 07:50.470
The safe has been picked
clean. There's no bullets,

07:50.490 --> 07:52.290
there's no pellets, not
even a butter knife.

07:52.790 --> 07:55.200
Since Special Agent
Dolls is no longer...

07:56.100 --> 07:58.370
... the BBD pipeline, it's dried up.

07:59.970 --> 08:03.740
- Does anybody have any good news?
- Ooh! Um, okay,

08:03.760 --> 08:05.970
so since we lost our
phones in the woods,

08:06.070 --> 08:08.720
I, uh, looked around at home...

08:08.860 --> 08:11.280
For crying out loud...
They're in here somewhere.

08:11.380 --> 08:14.330
Just give her a minute. Her purse
is bigger than my vehicle.

08:14.340 --> 08:17.450
Ooh, here they are. Found
these in a box at home.

08:17.550 --> 08:20.020
I guess there's nothing in the
budget for new ones, so...

08:20.120 --> 08:22.519
- Ha. There's no budget.
- Alright, charge 'em up,

08:22.520 --> 08:24.790
and then immediately delete
all your texts from Champ.

08:24.890 --> 08:27.200
Especially the photos. Obviously.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.419
I will scour Shorty's
for any projectiles

08:29.420 --> 08:31.500
- to kill things with.
- Right behind you.

08:33.620 --> 08:36.210
Here? You know... flip.

08:36.220 --> 08:39.240
So if you're ready to go... see her...

08:39.340 --> 08:41.440
Oh, right, yeah.

08:42.710 --> 08:45.250
I'm just not sure I can
handle any more surprises.

08:52.550 --> 08:54.190
Paints quite the picture,

08:54.290 --> 08:58.100
the parts that aren't crossed
out in heavy Sharpie anyway.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.990
You're strong, baby girl.

09:02.030 --> 09:03.830
You deserve answers.

09:03.930 --> 09:07.030
I'm just not sure you're gonna
get the ones you're looking for.

09:07.870 --> 09:11.300
We'll head up the prison soon
as Doc and I ammo up. Okay?

09:11.410 --> 09:14.039
Okay. And, Waves, believe me,

09:14.040 --> 09:16.040
Mama is doing better.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.750
Somebody help me, please!!

09:23.380 --> 09:24.650
Please!

09:24.750 --> 09:26.950
You've gone too far this time.

09:29.390 --> 09:32.660
You'll never get out.
You'll never get out!

09:32.760 --> 09:35.360
You'll never get out!! Please!

09:40.120 --> 09:43.320
- Please!!
- _

09:47.350 --> 09:49.050
So we are broke.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.520
Don't you have any gold fillings

09:51.620 --> 09:54.360
you could sell for some bullets or...

09:54.900 --> 09:56.990
old-timey photo of your junk?

09:57.090 --> 10:00.460
Unfortunately not. Saw
a motion picture once

10:00.480 --> 10:02.259
where young women not unlike yourself

10:02.260 --> 10:04.199
made a killing washing cars.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.500
Were they wearing parkas?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.740
As I recall, they were
wearing very little.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.570
Which I suppose is the draw.

10:10.670 --> 10:13.070
Could have a bachelor auction.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.779
I'd make it rain for you if I could.

10:16.780 --> 10:21.060
Oh, I would stand in that rain
to watch you lather my car.

10:22.220 --> 10:23.940
So it's official.

10:24.420 --> 10:27.020
We'd watch each other
do degrading things.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.789
Doc?

10:29.790 --> 10:32.390
Ah, pardon me. That's my pistol.

10:34.980 --> 10:36.700
- What's this?
- No, don't!

10:43.210 --> 10:44.770
It's adorable.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.410
Did you make it?

10:48.040 --> 10:51.050
It's from before you made your decision.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.799
I was gonna get rid of
it when I had a chance.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.080
Yeah.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.880
Like I got rid of her.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.719
You sent Alice to safety.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.659
I always do that,

11:01.660 --> 11:04.560
take the easy way out
when things get hard.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.880
Like I gave up on Mama.

11:06.980 --> 11:09.119
- _
- I told you he was real.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.320
- _
- I never stopped believing.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.700
I wait, I wait, I wait.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.409
He will rise again. And when he does...

11:17.410 --> 11:19.639
"Mankind will be enslaved
in body and in mind."

11:19.640 --> 11:21.179
God.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.600
It's no Sexy Back, but it
does stay in your head.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.639
I don't want it in my head anymore.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.220
Uh, okay. I...

11:30.250 --> 11:33.590
You're not gonna understand
this or... care.

11:34.690 --> 11:38.090
I'm getting out of
Purgatory for good, Mama.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.590
With Waverly?

11:41.860 --> 11:43.160
No.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.360
She'd never leave.

11:45.020 --> 11:46.819
Gus and Curtis'll look after her

11:46.820 --> 11:48.320
a hell of a lot better
than I ever could.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.600
- You can't leave her.
- You left us!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.340
Yeah, I'd do it all again.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.280
She can never know I'm here. Come here.

11:56.710 --> 11:59.439
Yeah, well, I... thought you
were with me for a minute,

11:59.440 --> 12:00.800
but no, still crazy.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.480
You gotta promise me!

12:03.290 --> 12:04.490
Fine!

12:05.060 --> 12:06.280
Jeez.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.290
Why did I even come here? Man.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.630
Yeah... why did you?

12:14.530 --> 12:17.230
Wynonna, don't ever, ever come back.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.310
No problem.

12:27.110 --> 12:29.240
I'll send you a postcard from Greece.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.140
Bye, Mama.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.980
Thanks for everything.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.020
I never stopped being angry at her.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.350
You do not share your mother's failings.

12:38.450 --> 12:40.390
Genetic insanity. Have you met me?

12:41.920 --> 12:44.319
I know you better than
you want anyone to

12:44.320 --> 12:45.660
and I'm still here.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.980
Well, crazy knows crazy.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.180
Oh. Sorry...

13:02.280 --> 13:03.740
Bad timing.

13:04.310 --> 13:07.120
I guess it's only fair, me
walking in on you for a change.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.850
Fine. Nothing to interrupt here.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.680
- Sure?
- Sure.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.880
- Sure.
- Tsk.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.390
Can we talk? It's... about Nedley.

13:17.490 --> 13:19.760
Not again. How many more
plungers do we need?

13:19.860 --> 13:22.219
Uh, he said, and I quote:

13:22.220 --> 13:24.900
"Drag Earp's ass in here to
meet with the new city manager

13:24.920 --> 13:27.869
before the flimsy cover story
I gave goes up in smoke."

13:27.870 --> 13:29.439
- Blurgh.
- Yeah. To which I replied:

13:29.440 --> 13:31.099
"I would rather watch
an all-male version of

13:31.100 --> 13:32.539
Pitch Perfect. Twice."

13:32.540 --> 13:35.100
- But you came to get me.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. And you gotta go,

13:35.110 --> 13:37.710
or there won't be a Sheriff's
department left to fight the fights.

13:38.810 --> 13:41.450
Stupid effective Supergirl power speech.

13:41.550 --> 13:43.550
Hoo, mama!

13:43.650 --> 13:46.290
Bad lead, good times.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.920
- Here you go.
- Ah, thanks.

13:50.590 --> 13:52.390
What's gonna happen to us?

13:52.490 --> 13:54.900
Uh, well, if we're lucky, we get old.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.500
No, I meant without Dolls.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.730
Oh.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.240
Jeez, I don't know.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.440
This is not good for my anxiety.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.460
You know, you need to take a break.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.210
Maybe someone new to
talk to. Preferably male.

14:09.310 --> 14:11.980
When I downloaded Tinder, it
said I was the only match

14:12.080 --> 14:14.120
within 50 miles and I still swiped left.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.380
Ha-ha.

14:16.390 --> 14:18.990
Very funny. It could happen.
I mean, I met Nicole.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.920
She walked into a roadhouse bar,

14:21.040 --> 14:23.559
you whipped off your
shirt, and that was that!

14:23.560 --> 14:25.290
Like a beautiful fairytale porno.

14:25.390 --> 14:26.930
See? It could happen.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.130
It's called a unicorn because
there's only one of them.

14:30.230 --> 14:31.630
Tsk. Well...

14:32.230 --> 14:34.220
I ran into somebody today.

14:34.260 --> 14:36.100
- No. No, no, no. No setups.
- Yeah.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.440
- I knew him in high school.
- Mm-mm. No setups!

14:38.540 --> 14:40.220
He's back in Purgatory. Has a job.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.759
Wow. In town and employed?

14:41.760 --> 14:43.280
Guess I better pick a wedding date.

14:44.660 --> 14:46.209
Excuse me. Hi.

14:46.210 --> 14:48.020
Hi!

14:48.550 --> 14:50.950
- Unicorn alert.
- Really, him? QB1?

14:50.980 --> 14:53.439
Oh, no, no. No, I don't
football... anymore.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.889
Uh, Nedley sent me.

14:54.890 --> 14:58.800
- Oh. So, Robin, this is Jeremy.
- Ah, Jeremy.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.750
- Hi.
- Sheriff Nedley said

15:00.760 --> 15:03.760
you might be able to help me
with a unique, uh, problem.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.700
- Uh, unique how?
- Well, it has to do with...

15:06.800 --> 15:08.379
It's a weird... I wanna say...

15:08.380 --> 15:10.120
- poplar?
- Hmm.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.479
You want to talk about a tree?

15:11.480 --> 15:14.760
Pfft... Anyway, I gotta go.

15:14.910 --> 15:17.020
- No.
- Yeah, I'm getting my nails done.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.980
Chippity-chip-chip...

15:19.080 --> 15:21.720
No, um, I thought you were
allergic to nail polish.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.420
- No.
- I remember. I...

15:23.460 --> 15:24.979
I don't want you to go there and die,

15:24.980 --> 15:26.919
'cause that could... that could happen.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.350
It's... Look, I just...
Please, gotta be safe.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.290
Waverly, be safe. Be safe and just...

15:33.300 --> 15:37.060
So, Jeremy, um... you
have any snacks in here?

15:38.070 --> 15:39.660
Are you vegan?

15:44.900 --> 15:46.180
Hello?

15:46.260 --> 15:48.839
Is this Michelle Gibson's
emergency contact?

15:48.840 --> 15:51.240
This is the last number we have on file.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.320
Ri-right. Yeah.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.080
Is something wrong?

15:57.090 --> 15:58.850
This the Ghost River Institution.

15:58.950 --> 16:01.280
Been an incident. Another one.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.630
The warden needs a signature in
order to approve a transfer.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.030
- A transfer?
- Yes. Michelle Gibson,

16:07.130 --> 16:09.360
to a more secure facility.

16:09.460 --> 16:13.770
Oh. Uh... sure. As long
as I can see her first.

16:13.780 --> 16:17.460
Well, you better hustle. The
warden has the bus idling outside.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.640
I'm on my way.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.980
To visit my mom in prison.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.620
- So this dreadful deciduous...
- The murder tree.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.190
Yeah, there were fancy
clothes around it.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.050
Uh, sounds inTREEguing.

16:33.150 --> 16:35.260
That's good, 'cause I'm
completely stumped.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.890
Ah... Okay. Uh...

16:38.990 --> 16:40.819
what about this thick red liquid

16:40.820 --> 16:42.740
running down the trunk. As in blood?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.139
- Did I say blood?
- It can't be blood.

16:44.140 --> 16:45.599
- Not from a tree.
- It's probably just sap.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.439
- Except I tasted it.
- You tasted the murder tree?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.740
It was blood.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.879
Oh, God, I know it sounds crazy.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.179
You think I'm crazy. Am I crazy?

16:52.180 --> 16:54.540
No, no. Hey, crazy into my vegan sticks.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.580
Yeah. Sorry. I, um, I get
hangry when I'm terrified.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.910
So...

16:59.940 --> 17:02.200
We'll get to the bottom of it. Together.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.549
And with Waverly.

17:05.550 --> 17:07.450
- Oh, isn't she the best?
- She's the best.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.319
When I was in high school,
she was the only one

17:09.329 --> 17:11.839
who didn't ignore me or
actively make my life hell.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.800
You know, there wasn't really
anyone else like me around, so...

17:14.900 --> 17:16.930
- Ah. Gay?
- Irish.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.560
- Yeah, gay.
- Oh. Yes, of course.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.940
So as soon as I could,
I headed out west.

17:23.780 --> 17:26.470
Uh, um, could you take me
back to the murder tree?

17:26.569 --> 17:29.040
- I'd love to!
- Cool! It's a... it's a date.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.120
- With the murder tree.
- I've had worse.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.540
Waverly?

17:52.020 --> 17:54.940
Wow. My little one.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.870
Mama.

17:56.970 --> 17:58.140
No.

17:59.570 --> 18:02.340
Get out. Get out!

18:02.440 --> 18:03.980
Get out!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.010
- No!
- Get out!! Go!!

18:06.110 --> 18:08.120
- No, it's okay, Mama.
- Get out!!

18:08.220 --> 18:10.880
- Get out!! No, get out!!
- It's me, Mama.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.400
I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!

18:15.920 --> 18:18.180
Get out! Get out!

18:18.220 --> 18:20.020
I'll... kill you.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.590
No, I'll kill you. I'll kill you!!!

18:22.690 --> 18:24.690
Mama, it's okay. I won't hurt you.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.319
No, don't hurt her!

18:26.320 --> 18:28.620
No!!!

18:28.660 --> 18:31.019
She's unbound! She's loose!

18:34.670 --> 18:36.230
Kill the demon.

18:36.770 --> 18:37.980
Mama.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.540
You shouldn't have come here.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.440
- Well, thanks, genius.
- Oh...

18:46.240 --> 18:49.140
Kill the demon. Kill the demon.

18:49.340 --> 18:52.850
Kill the demon. Kill the demon.

18:54.860 --> 18:57.320
You don't have to keep checking that.

18:57.340 --> 18:59.199
Ah, sorry. I'm more of a

18:59.200 --> 19:01.700
"bright lights, big
city, 3G" kind of guy.

19:01.710 --> 19:04.900
But lead on. You are the expert.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.819
- Uh, more or less.
- More or less?

19:07.820 --> 19:10.370
So, Mr. Full Bars, what are
you doing in Purgatory?

19:10.470 --> 19:12.160
Came for work, stayed
to help my friends.

19:12.180 --> 19:14.569
- Nice.
- Where we going exactly?

19:14.570 --> 19:16.380
I was out maintaining the
trails and I saw it.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.180
It was a big tree with
red-stained trunk, buds...

19:19.280 --> 19:22.180
- Mm-hmm. You big into buds?
- Uh, no, that's my dad's shit.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.900
It's medicinal. I don't usually,

19:23.920 --> 19:27.720
but it's been sort of
a rough... time. Huh.

19:28.490 --> 19:31.190
Weird. It should be right around here.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.890
It was just here. Where
the hell did it go?

19:35.290 --> 19:37.229
There may need to be cuts.

19:37.230 --> 19:40.220
We're scraping the bottom of the
barrel as it is here, Claude.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.520
Yes. Now this brings me
to my next question.

19:43.540 --> 19:45.540
What do you mean, "we?"

19:49.810 --> 19:52.080
- Wynonna's been deputized.
- Huh.

19:52.180 --> 19:55.450
Well, we don't have a Wynonna
Earp on our HR records.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.420
I head a cross-border task force.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.779
We track down fugitives

20:01.780 --> 20:04.680
and go Tommy Lee Jones
on their... rumps.

20:04.790 --> 20:06.739
Oh, so you're a marshal?

20:06.740 --> 20:10.460
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- Why didn't you say so?

20:10.830 --> 20:13.130
Well, 'cause we don't
like to brag, so...

20:14.330 --> 20:18.219
Well, if the feds are
signing your paycheques

20:18.220 --> 20:21.240
and they're paying rent on our offices,

20:21.340 --> 20:23.570
I'm sure I can just call
the Justice Department

20:23.680 --> 20:24.940
and confirm.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.110
I'm sure everything will be hunky-dory.

20:27.210 --> 20:29.710
No, that won't be necessary.

20:29.810 --> 20:30.950
Clau...

20:33.990 --> 20:35.220
Douche.

20:36.090 --> 20:38.260
Oh... this could all be over.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.100
Not the fight, of course. But
our ability to fight it.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.919
Sheriff, look.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.059
You and Officer Haught
are awesome, okay?

20:45.060 --> 20:48.100
As far as stupid cops go. The
town's lucky to have you.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.779
So how about you grow a pair

20:49.780 --> 20:51.990
and tell the goons at the
county office to give you

20:52.000 --> 20:53.939
the resources you need
so we can all just

20:53.940 --> 20:55.750
do our jobs saving each and every person

20:55.760 --> 20:58.700
in the Ghost River Triangle from
dying a grisly and painful death?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.310
You think I haven't tried that?

21:02.450 --> 21:05.020
I have been covering this
shit up for too long.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.350
I...

21:06.450 --> 21:08.350
I'm tired of it.

21:09.390 --> 21:12.690
Well, maybe then you should
just step aside, you know?

21:12.790 --> 21:14.699
Let someone else have a turn.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.180
Someone who's still got some fight left.

21:20.470 --> 21:22.300
Uh-oh. Sad Waverly.

21:33.410 --> 21:35.310
Hey, what's going on?

21:35.410 --> 21:38.620
- I went to see Mama.
- You... Alone?

21:38.720 --> 21:39.959
They called your old phone,

21:39.960 --> 21:41.370
said they were gonna transfer her.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.490
- I didn't know how to find you.
- Oh, God.

21:43.820 --> 21:45.979
What have they given her? I mean,

21:45.980 --> 21:48.250
maybe... maybe it's her medication or...

21:48.300 --> 21:49.960
Hey, stop. Stop.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.799
- No.
- Stop! Stop!

21:51.800 --> 21:53.630
Stop. Stop.

21:56.270 --> 21:58.619
It's my fault. Mama made me promise

21:58.620 --> 21:59.969
not to tell you where she was.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.740
Yeah, well, maybe she had good reason.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.240
Why?

22:03.780 --> 22:05.480
She wants to kill me.

22:05.580 --> 22:08.150
Okay, of course she doesn't.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.650
No, no, she...

22:10.650 --> 22:12.250
She tried to kill me.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.690
Where're you going?

22:18.790 --> 22:21.180
- To end this shit.
- What?

22:22.290 --> 22:25.320
- Trees don't just go anywhere.
- Yeah, obviously.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.370
I wouldn't make up a story
about a bleeding tree

22:27.400 --> 22:29.120
just to get you alone
in the woods, would I?

22:29.160 --> 22:32.200
Great. The one available guy in
town, he's probably a murderer.

22:32.300 --> 22:33.300
Are you?

22:33.301 --> 22:35.140
- A murderer?
- Available.

22:36.370 --> 22:38.610
And also, you know, not a murderer.

22:41.150 --> 22:43.850
Oh, what is with all the sudden fog?

22:43.950 --> 22:46.180
Stay close. What... what does it show?

22:48.690 --> 22:51.110
Wait. These... these are our tracks.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.390
We've just been going in
circles! Where are we?

22:53.400 --> 22:56.030
- Well, I-I'd say lost.
- Lost? How?

22:56.130 --> 22:57.760
Aren't you a park ranger?

22:57.860 --> 23:00.560
- I'm a jazz historian.
- What?

23:00.670 --> 23:03.990
Yeah. I just... I took
the first job I could

23:04.000 --> 23:05.800
just to come back here and help my dad.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.900
He's sick. Parkinson's.

23:08.010 --> 23:10.010
Shit. Sorry.

23:10.110 --> 23:13.410
Yeah. Anyway, I'm super
crap at the woods stuff.

23:13.510 --> 23:15.040
Last time I led a school field trip,

23:15.050 --> 23:17.559
there was a hiccup and the
buddy system broke down.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.820
I misplaced one.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.480
- One what?
- A... a... a kid.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.459
- What?! You lost a child?!
- There were a lot of them.

23:23.460 --> 23:24.840
And he... he was found safe and sound.

23:24.850 --> 23:27.420
It's just... he was
following a cool bird.

23:27.530 --> 23:29.059
So do you know anything

23:29.060 --> 23:30.729
- about the forest?
- I know I hate it.

23:30.730 --> 23:33.399
- Argh. What about glamping?
- If I'm drinking an espresso,

23:33.400 --> 23:34.906
it better be on a terrazzo in Florence.

23:34.930 --> 23:36.599
Okay. First, hard same.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.520
Second, we're gonna have to combine

23:38.540 --> 23:41.140
our non-existent woodsmen skills to...

23:42.440 --> 23:43.870
Whoa.

23:45.940 --> 23:49.110
What... is...

23:49.210 --> 23:50.519
that?

23:50.520 --> 23:53.450
Stairs? What are they...
What are they doing here?

24:02.580 --> 24:05.300
- Oh, no, no! Do not climb those!
- But why not?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.819
I just know! I feel it in a...

24:07.820 --> 24:10.120
totally normal part of my body.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.040
Uh... those stairs...
they're not for us.

24:14.570 --> 24:16.170
Okay, what kind of a cop are you?

24:16.270 --> 24:18.010
We've gotta get outta here.

24:19.780 --> 24:22.659
- Who you calling?
- A sexy human bloodhound.

24:22.660 --> 24:24.000
He's not available.

24:35.590 --> 24:37.590
Ugh!

24:39.330 --> 24:41.000
No more visitors!

24:41.670 --> 24:44.430
She attacked her therapist. We
don't need your approval...

24:44.440 --> 24:46.200
Take her to Guantanamo for all I care.

24:46.250 --> 24:49.570
If you ever threaten her again,
if you ever so much as touch

24:49.670 --> 24:53.810
a strand of that perfect,
luscious mane, I swear to God...

24:54.000 --> 24:55.840
Wynonna, I'm so sorry.

24:57.620 --> 24:59.980
For what you've done to Waverly,
sorry's not gonna cut it.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.690
Not for Waverly.

25:02.620 --> 25:03.860
For this.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.860
- Shoot her!
- She can't even use that gun.

25:07.830 --> 25:09.590
- Ah!
- Yah... ! Yeah.

25:10.230 --> 25:12.160
Well, I guess she can work it that way.

25:13.230 --> 25:14.760
- Gun, please.
- Mama.

25:17.030 --> 25:18.440
Thank you.

25:19.940 --> 25:21.240
Keys.

25:23.370 --> 25:25.740
Please, Mama. You don't want to do this.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.610
She's not giving me a choice.

25:27.710 --> 25:31.550
Baby... I'm so sorry that
you got dragged into this.

25:31.650 --> 25:34.620
But don't get in my way.

25:43.730 --> 25:45.630
'Morning, sunshine.

25:45.730 --> 25:46.879
Let's get after her.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.829
- I know where she's going.
- Lock her up.

25:48.830 --> 25:50.219
What do you mean, lock me up?!

25:50.220 --> 25:52.150
What the hell did I do?!
If you say emails...

25:52.170 --> 25:53.560
You gave a violent convict your firearm.

25:53.580 --> 25:56.360
- Makes you an accomplice.
- What?! No! No!

25:56.400 --> 25:58.079
We'll hold you until the
authorities arrive.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.259
Please! She's gonna kill my sister!!

26:00.260 --> 26:01.740
She's gonna kill her!!

26:06.260 --> 26:07.820
Here.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.760
You were right.

26:10.290 --> 26:12.930
Reconnecting with estranged parents?

26:13.030 --> 26:14.730
Real bad idea.

26:17.430 --> 26:20.770
I'm so sorry it didn't work
out the way you wanted.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.080
She...

26:24.360 --> 26:26.360
She called me a demon.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.480
A demon.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.150
Over and over and over.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.320
Is that why she left?

26:34.890 --> 26:36.290
Your mother...

26:36.850 --> 26:39.320
... had a psychological disorder, okay?

26:39.900 --> 26:43.090
I went back in the archives,
way back, almost 20 years,

26:43.190 --> 26:44.879
and I pulled the report from her arrest.

26:44.880 --> 26:45.890
What?

26:49.360 --> 26:50.360
Arson?

26:50.361 --> 26:52.580
Yeah, for burning down
the homestead barn.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.770
What? Who gets 20 years for
burning down their own barn?

26:55.870 --> 26:58.610
And... why is there only
one sheet of paper?

26:58.710 --> 27:01.040
- It's been pulled.
- What? By whom?

27:01.540 --> 27:02.950
By me.

27:04.850 --> 27:07.180
I thought it best if no one knew.

27:07.820 --> 27:10.900
But you're a grownup now and
you use proper grammar,

27:10.920 --> 27:12.690
so I guess you have a right to know.

27:15.330 --> 27:19.230
Michelle didn't go to prison
because she burned down the barn.

27:21.030 --> 27:24.030
She went because her
youngest daughter was in it.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.240
What?

27:31.710 --> 27:34.330
I found the car and I'm headed west.

27:34.340 --> 27:35.599
Okay, are... are you sure?

27:35.600 --> 27:37.249
Do you, uh, do you need a compass?

27:37.250 --> 27:39.780
I am a compass! Describe
your surroundings.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.520
Okay, um, there is snow.

27:43.050 --> 27:44.590
And trees.

27:44.690 --> 27:46.419
Snow and trees everywhere.

27:46.420 --> 27:48.220
What's the topography, Jeremy?

27:48.930 --> 27:51.630
Flat? Flat, I guess. Yeah.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.479
Do you happen to see an uncanny

27:53.480 --> 27:55.260
ancient stairway by any chance?

27:57.870 --> 27:58.870
Doc?

28:00.870 --> 28:02.970
I'll be there in two shakes.

28:20.090 --> 28:22.190
Who's there?!

28:26.230 --> 28:29.060
What child is that?!

28:35.240 --> 28:36.809
No!!

28:36.810 --> 28:39.210
No, don't take me back there!!

28:39.310 --> 28:41.880
Don't take me back there!!

29:02.920 --> 29:05.400
You will do my bidding,

29:05.500 --> 29:08.000
John Henry Holliday.

29:08.100 --> 29:11.040
It is you. Bulshar.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.180
I have many names.

29:14.010 --> 29:16.410
How shall I coerce you?

29:16.510 --> 29:18.110
With pain?

29:19.180 --> 29:20.980
You felt it before;

29:21.080 --> 29:23.950
the searing, tortuous agony.

29:24.790 --> 29:28.520
Or with the promise of reprieve?

29:31.960 --> 29:35.530
- Reprieve from what?
- The reminders of your destiny.

29:35.700 --> 29:39.480
Of the eternal suffering
you will endure.

29:40.970 --> 29:42.199
At what cost?

29:42.200 --> 29:44.200
A simple exchange.

29:48.180 --> 29:50.280
Doc! Doc!

29:50.380 --> 29:52.510
Where am I?! Where'd he go?

29:52.620 --> 29:53.880
Who?

29:55.820 --> 29:58.590
Snowy Owl. Big one.

29:59.990 --> 30:01.790
Feels like it's warmin' up.

30:01.890 --> 30:03.290
Chinook's comin' in.

30:03.390 --> 30:04.960
We've been looking everywhere for you.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.900
Well, you found me.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.470
- So this is your super tracker?
- He's the best.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.530
Just having a slow 'stache day.

30:11.630 --> 30:13.400
You really should've brought a compass.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.450
You said something about a staircase.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.910
Oh, yeah, yeah. I took photos.

30:18.010 --> 30:21.210
But we got turned around
and it was... gone.

30:21.310 --> 30:23.580
Did you see anything?

30:24.610 --> 30:26.080
I did not.

30:37.430 --> 30:38.590
Oh.

30:43.030 --> 30:46.029
- This is fun. Huh?
- Yeah.

30:46.030 --> 30:47.460
_

30:47.770 --> 30:49.340
Like hell I won't.

30:50.670 --> 30:51.779
You're wasting time.

30:51.780 --> 30:53.239
We should be tracking a fugitive.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.559
I'll leave that to law enforcement.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.449
I am law enforcement, Toolio!

30:56.450 --> 30:58.720
I just called every agency
and no one I talked to

30:58.760 --> 31:00.719
has ever heard of a Marshal Earp or any

31:00.720 --> 31:02.560
cross-border task force.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.090
Matter of fact, your name had
just been flagged as a fraud.

31:05.190 --> 31:06.739
Ugh. Stupid Claude.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.080
Okay, alright, forget about me.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.539
My murderous madwoman of a
mother is on the loose,

31:11.540 --> 31:12.679
so if we could put a BOLO out.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.430
No, I can't. I can't!

31:15.060 --> 31:16.319
The board's already on my ass over

31:16.320 --> 31:18.320
excessive force by my guards.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.219
We'll bring your mama
back nice and quiet.

31:20.220 --> 31:21.640
Nobody'll know she was even gone.

31:21.740 --> 31:25.310
If she never left, Green Mile,
then why am I still here?!

31:25.410 --> 31:28.480
- I... Uh...
- Her mother killed her.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.940
- What?
- What?

31:30.040 --> 31:31.910
Michelle Gibson attacked
her younger daughter.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.599
We have proof.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.820
Then she killed the older
one during her escape.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.950
Her... mother killed her?

31:39.060 --> 31:41.160
Does this ass look dead to you?

31:41.260 --> 31:44.560
I'll take care of it, Warden. As usual.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.300
And I'll make it look good.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.060
Not in front of the inmates, okay?

31:51.170 --> 31:53.100
Oh... Shitshank.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.400
I've been hiding out here a long time.

31:55.510 --> 31:57.419
But look who just landed in my lap.

31:57.420 --> 31:58.979
And without her gun.

31:58.980 --> 32:02.040
You picked a bad day
to come at the heir.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.810
- Isn't life funny sometimes?
- Enjoy it while you can.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.020
You sure?

32:15.120 --> 32:16.960
Only been waiting 20 years.

32:18.130 --> 32:21.960
Well, I got called to a
situation at the Earp farm.

32:22.530 --> 32:26.340
By the time I got there, the
barn was lit up like a torch.

32:27.540 --> 32:30.820
You... somehow you escaped.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.040
I mean, you were covered with soot,

32:33.080 --> 32:35.880
you were crying, but you were unharmed.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.350
And my mother?

32:41.550 --> 32:43.450
She was...

32:43.550 --> 32:46.120
locked in your daddy's patrol car.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.090
She set the fire.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.660
But she was no murderous sociopath.

32:51.760 --> 32:55.100
She was Michelle Gibson. Rodeo spitfire.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.170
The wild heart and loyal
soul of Purgatory.

32:57.180 --> 33:00.270
Even the thugs and the
dimwits drank to her.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.000
With her.

33:03.810 --> 33:05.110
They loved her.

33:05.210 --> 33:07.340
Just like her daughters.

33:07.810 --> 33:09.280
One of them.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.910
Look, she wasn't herself that night.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.350
She kept... she kept insisting that...

33:16.920 --> 33:20.620
... that she was trying
to vanquish a demon.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.190
A demon she thought was...

33:24.540 --> 33:25.720
me.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.980
Well, that would explain
the occult nonsense

33:28.060 --> 33:29.559
that Ward saw plastered all over

33:29.560 --> 33:31.169
the barn before she lit the match.

33:31.170 --> 33:32.900
Did you believe it?

33:36.810 --> 33:38.759
That was Ward's interpretation.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.460
Look, your pop was my boss, so...

33:41.600 --> 33:43.770
And I know... I know I
should've been braver.

33:43.780 --> 33:46.180
I should've defended her. But...

33:46.980 --> 33:51.090
... I booked Michelle like I was told to.

33:51.190 --> 33:53.320
God, this just keeps getting worse.

33:53.420 --> 33:56.260
I've been trying to make
up for it ever since.

33:56.860 --> 33:59.130
I kept watch over you.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.800
I tried to set Wynonna on
the straight and narrow.

34:05.570 --> 34:07.300
That didn't work out.

34:09.639 --> 34:12.370
And when I became Sheriff,
I pulled the report.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.080
I didn't want anyone seeing it.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.449
Right.

34:18.580 --> 34:20.679
Or maybe it was the right thing to do:

34:20.679 --> 34:22.179
send her away.

34:23.250 --> 34:24.520
Look...

34:25.659 --> 34:27.860
I don't know what happened that night.

34:30.460 --> 34:34.860
But there isn't an evil bone
in Michelle Gibson's body.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.859
Well, if I've learned anything over

34:36.860 --> 34:38.860
the past few months, it's that...

34:39.540 --> 34:42.170
... evil wears many faces.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.719
Am I going to get fitted
for my cute red jumpsuit?

34:50.780 --> 34:53.179
I'm gonna kill you. Thought
I made that clear.

34:53.179 --> 34:55.300
Whatevs. Someone'll take my place.

34:55.340 --> 34:56.379
Your sister's not an Earp.

34:56.380 --> 34:58.380
That's the only reason
she's not dead already.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.490
You that clueless?

35:00.590 --> 35:02.219
Do you not get Revenant
Snapchat up here?

35:02.220 --> 35:04.220
I had a kid, dipshit.

35:04.930 --> 35:06.659
Yeah.

35:06.660 --> 35:08.139
No matter what happens to me,

35:08.140 --> 35:10.560
this plays out all over again.

35:10.930 --> 35:13.200
Or we can end it now.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.370
I would've kicked you in the
neck, but you don't have one.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.859
Taking your belt off at work?

35:20.860 --> 35:22.480
#MeToo, buddy.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.350
Not bad for a girl.

35:24.450 --> 35:26.880
I had a good training
partner. For a guy.

35:49.310 --> 35:52.140
I hope tomorrow's not prison photo day.

35:57.250 --> 35:59.650
Now, you're gonna feel a little pinch.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.480
Oh, thank God you're here.

36:03.090 --> 36:06.040
Brought your head guard's... head.

36:06.690 --> 36:08.420
Two points.

36:09.590 --> 36:12.139
Be a doll? Also, does your
car have seat warmers?

36:12.140 --> 36:15.200
Because I ripped my pants while
decapitating. It happens.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.370
Keys, please.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.340
Michelle Gibson's finally gonna
slay her little demon child.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.440
You guys suck at
treating mental illness.

36:23.870 --> 36:26.079
You... you think today is the first time

36:26.080 --> 36:27.709
she tried to kill your little sister?

36:27.710 --> 36:29.980
Why do you think she's
been in here so long?

36:34.120 --> 36:36.320
Better hurry. She got
one helluva head start.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.590
Yeah. But I'm me.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.520
Mist, mist...

36:42.560 --> 36:43.880
Hey, check it out. The staircase?

36:44.540 --> 36:46.030
No. More mist.

36:46.130 --> 36:48.600
How can that be? We
saw it. It was there.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.140
Then it wasn't.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.010
Yeah, kind of like the murder tree?

36:52.110 --> 36:54.380
Anything in jazz history
that could help explain it?

36:54.420 --> 36:56.140
Well, I mean, it sounds
like the Delta blues.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.560
You know, a lot of songs about
making deals with devils and such.

36:58.580 --> 37:01.920
- What kinda idiot would do that?
- Someone seriously delusional.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.790
Wait. You genius!

37:04.800 --> 37:07.260
Wh-what if the staircase
wasn't there at all?

37:07.920 --> 37:09.779
Folie à deux. Shared psychosis.

37:09.780 --> 37:12.120
What if we were having a
delusion at the same time?

37:12.190 --> 37:15.430
Huh. You know, next time, can
we maybe delude over bowling?

37:15.530 --> 37:18.270
I mean, we should follow up
on this tree thing, right?

37:18.370 --> 37:20.750
Ah, yes. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.550
Great, great. You let me
know the time and place

37:22.560 --> 37:23.560
and I will be there.

37:23.570 --> 37:25.270
If there's nachos. Vegan nachos.

37:25.370 --> 37:28.740
I... Nachos for sure. Uh,
the whole thing for sure.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.950
Uh... I mean, obviously, if
I'm planning it, then...

37:33.150 --> 37:34.780
Whoa. You okay?

37:36.980 --> 37:39.599
Yeah. Uh, allergies, I guess.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.640
It must've been from being
out in the woods all day.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.339
You really need a new job.

37:43.340 --> 37:45.340
Text you later.

37:50.170 --> 37:52.630
Have you seen the cardinals
in the courtyard?

37:52.730 --> 37:55.740
They're building a nest.
Isn't it lovely?

37:56.910 --> 37:58.619
They're gonna be laying eggs,

37:58.620 --> 38:00.620
starting a family right here.

38:00.900 --> 38:03.810
Do you miss them? Your own family?

38:04.480 --> 38:06.040
I like it here.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.880
I don't want to cause
them any more trouble.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.990
And, hey, you all promised...
you all promised

38:12.000 --> 38:13.460
you're never gonna contact my girls.

38:13.470 --> 38:17.060
That's a very, very important
promise to me, very important.

38:17.430 --> 38:18.830
Of course.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.600
Can you please shut up, for once?!

38:22.100 --> 38:24.040
I thought you wanted to talk.

38:24.180 --> 38:28.200
Of course. I'm sorry, Doctor.

38:29.100 --> 38:31.210
Tell me more about the birds.

38:32.380 --> 38:36.250
The robins, sparrows, magpies.

38:36.260 --> 38:38.380
Here. Just careful. It's hot.

38:39.850 --> 38:43.320
So... she say anything... helpful?

38:44.220 --> 38:47.220
She likes prison. And cardinals.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.860
And doesn't give a rat's
hiney about her family.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.319
You can say "ass."

38:56.470 --> 38:58.259
Whisky?

38:58.260 --> 38:59.599
The good whisky.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.370
Um, there's some in the barn. I'll go.

39:02.470 --> 39:06.010
No. It's cold out there.
You're not dressed.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.420
And you look like you've seen a ghost.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.100
Sit.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.440
Or I can get you some tea.

39:16.460 --> 39:18.720
Yeah, I do not care much
about being sober right now.

39:18.820 --> 39:21.739
I must confer with
Wynonna upon her return.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.119
I just keep an eye on those cardinals.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.879
What is that on the tape?

39:26.880 --> 39:29.199
Oh, um, Michelle Gibson
talking to a prison therapist.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.660
I can turn it off.

39:31.170 --> 39:32.700
No.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.959
The other voice of the person

39:34.960 --> 39:36.680
in the room with them. Who is that?

39:36.960 --> 39:38.910
The third person.

39:39.670 --> 39:42.790
Officer Haught, tell me you
hear that infernal groan!

39:42.800 --> 39:44.210
There's nobody else, Doc.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.180
This is not enough.

39:49.280 --> 39:52.850
And we, we will not be enough.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.880
Mama?!

40:10.340 --> 40:12.469
- Get away.
- What are you doing?

40:12.470 --> 40:16.110
The demon. Waverly! Get away! Go!

40:16.210 --> 40:17.359
Now!!!

40:17.360 --> 40:19.860
No! Mama, please just calm down, okay?!

40:21.380 --> 40:24.150
It's too late. The demon's here.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.420
What?

40:25.520 --> 40:27.860
Is it... is it me?

40:31.560 --> 40:34.700
No, sweetheart. But she came for you.

40:43.490 --> 40:45.460
Dad, you been gardening out here?

40:46.230 --> 40:47.390
Hey, Dad.

41:16.420 --> 41:17.920
Waverly!

41:18.530 --> 41:19.760
Waverly!

41:20.860 --> 41:23.880
Where's... You're all here.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.630
Of course! It's the place to be!

41:26.530 --> 41:28.270
Where's Mama? Have you seen her?

41:28.370 --> 41:31.079
Oh, not to worry, we've got
Mama locked in the barn

41:31.080 --> 41:33.440
until we can decide what
else to do with her.

41:34.740 --> 41:36.440
- We?
- Mama came back.

41:36.540 --> 41:38.559
She attacked Waverly.

41:38.560 --> 41:39.909
Oh, my God.

41:39.910 --> 41:42.680
But Jolene showed up just in time.

41:43.380 --> 41:44.639
Jolene.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.930
Now, be prepared to do a lot of squats,

41:46.940 --> 41:49.290
because I made your favourite.

41:49.390 --> 41:52.190
- Mm! Mm-mm!
- Brownies.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.870
Back the truck up.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.970
That is... More, please.

42:04.770 --> 42:07.050
Well, if that demon's coming,
like your Mama says,

42:07.060 --> 42:08.450
we have got to keep your strength up.

42:08.460 --> 42:10.540
- There's a demon coming?
- Yes, Wynonna.

42:11.060 --> 42:12.819
There is a demon coming.

42:12.820 --> 42:14.549
And it's going to kill Waverly.

42:14.550 --> 42:15.699
Oh!

42:15.700 --> 42:18.320
But of course, you can
stop it. I just know.

42:20.190 --> 42:21.199
Know what?

42:21.200 --> 42:23.400
- You're always here for us, Jolene.
- Oh.

42:23.420 --> 42:25.099
What would we do without you?

42:25.100 --> 42:26.829
Oh, I bet you'd all just die!

42:26.830 --> 42:28.499
All just die.
