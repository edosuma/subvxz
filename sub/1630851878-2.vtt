00:34.892 --> 00:38.031
(Chimera)

00:38.312 --> 00:41.142
(All characters, locations, religions,)

00:41.142 --> 00:44.111
(and incidents of this drama are fictional.)

00:45.982 --> 00:48.481
Sir, will you be like this?

00:48.481 --> 00:49.652
(May 30, 1984, Macheon)

00:49.652 --> 00:52.461
Well, they sent it from the US,

00:52.921 --> 00:55.161
and they guaranteed that it'll get here by this week.

00:55.161 --> 00:56.862
My experiment is next week.

00:57.161 --> 00:59.661
If it comes any later, I'll get fired by my professor.

01:00.002 --> 01:02.571
It'll come on Monday at the latest.

01:02.801 --> 01:05.902
I'll drop it off at the school as soon as it gets here.

01:06.341 --> 01:08.701
Please be careful, then. It can be dangerous.

01:08.972 --> 01:11.011
You know how much nitric acid costs per bottle.

01:11.011 --> 01:13.311
Of course, I do.

01:13.642 --> 01:15.282
So it'll be Monday at the latest?

01:15.282 --> 01:16.481
I'll put my trust in you.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.222
Don't worry about it. Bye!

01:19.222 --> 01:22.551
(Geumin Chemicals)

01:31.691 --> 01:35.261
Man, good grief. I should find a new vendor.

01:47.582 --> 01:49.612
President Chun Doo Hwan...

01:49.711 --> 01:53.122
discussed the possible ways of improving the relationships...

01:53.122 --> 01:54.821
between Korea and Japan.

01:55.321 --> 01:58.592
After last year's first visit of Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,

01:58.592 --> 02:00.592
they began to discuss...

02:00.592 --> 02:01.922
the possible reconciliation...

02:12.202 --> 02:13.872
(Giraffe Matches)

02:15.301 --> 02:16.472
Darn it.

02:33.491 --> 02:35.021
What's this?

02:40.002 --> 02:42.602
Oh, it must be a lighter.

03:11.031 --> 03:18.401
(Episode 2)

04:10.352 --> 04:11.452
Are you all right?

04:15.991 --> 04:17.362
Let me take you home.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.362
I'm fine.

05:45.682 --> 05:46.921
Will you hold this up for me?

05:47.452 --> 05:48.481
Sure.

05:50.622 --> 05:51.651
What is this?

05:54.861 --> 05:55.861
Chimera.

05:56.692 --> 05:57.731
Chimera?

05:58.192 --> 06:00.132
The first explosion was in a car.

06:00.302 --> 06:03.101
The second was an office. Is that a coincidence?

06:03.971 --> 06:05.031
What is?

06:06.002 --> 06:08.372
It's similar to the 1984 Macheon case.

06:09.812 --> 06:12.671
Oh, now that I think about it, there's a Chimera here too.

06:13.182 --> 06:14.242
Why is that?

06:14.781 --> 06:17.351
Why are the pattern and order alike?

06:17.952 --> 06:18.952
You're right.

06:19.822 --> 06:20.851
That's odd.

06:21.021 --> 06:23.351
I need to find out more about the case from 35 years ago.

06:24.021 --> 06:26.822
Which paper did the victim Son Wan Ki work for?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.101
Yes.

06:36.901 --> 06:38.031
He's still serving?

06:39.271 --> 06:40.341
Joongsan Police Station?

06:45.771 --> 06:47.411
My gosh.

06:48.582 --> 06:49.582
I apologize.

07:01.791 --> 07:03.062
Where did I see him before?

07:29.591 --> 07:30.721
What are you doing?

07:31.591 --> 07:33.892
Oh. You're back.

07:34.461 --> 07:35.521
Put that down.

07:40.031 --> 07:41.101
Who are you?

07:45.455 --> 07:47.325
I'm Kim Hyo Kyung from the UBS Newsroom.

07:48.854 --> 07:50.825
You're a police reporter? I've never seen you before.

07:50.825 --> 07:52.064
I'm an investigative journalist.

07:52.765 --> 07:55.564
What kind of investigation allows you to go through my phone?

07:57.135 --> 07:59.505
I heard there was an explosion in the middle of Seoul.

08:00.075 --> 08:01.474
Two in a row.

08:01.974 --> 08:03.775
Oh, was there really?

08:04.104 --> 08:06.145
What was the cause? An act of terror?

08:06.614 --> 08:09.174
Who did it? Do you have any suspects?

08:09.585 --> 08:11.945
Listen, Ms. Kim...

08:12.814 --> 08:14.854
Ms. Kim Hyo Kyung.

08:15.585 --> 08:16.585
Yes.

08:17.085 --> 08:18.124
Will you get lost?

08:19.325 --> 08:22.354
I'm seriously wounded and need rest.

08:24.664 --> 08:26.265
I'm exhausted.

08:28.364 --> 08:29.564
Gosh.

08:30.104 --> 08:31.664
Son Wan Ki, the first victim.

08:32.563 --> 08:34.335
He died when his car blew up.

08:35.804 --> 08:36.945
I have no idea.

08:38.205 --> 08:41.474
That's so much like what happened 35 years ago.

08:48.914 --> 08:50.825
How much do you know about Son Wan Ki?

08:55.095 --> 08:57.265
Do you know what made him famous?

09:01.164 --> 09:04.505
He landed a scoop 35 years ago.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.535
Here's the article he wrote.

09:07.775 --> 09:08.775
("Suspect of Macheon First-Degree Arson Case Arrested")

09:08.775 --> 09:11.044
"First-degree arson in Macheon, Gyeonggi Province."

09:11.804 --> 09:14.674
"Police arrested suspect Lee Sang Woo."

09:15.314 --> 09:18.544
"He'd worked at Taesung Chemicals until recently..."

09:18.544 --> 09:20.285
"when he was fired..."

09:20.285 --> 09:23.054
"for forming an illegal labor union and inciting workers."

09:23.324 --> 09:24.424
("What Made Him a Monster?")

09:24.424 --> 09:27.755
"He's said to have held a grudge, blackmailed the company,"

09:27.755 --> 09:29.395
"damaged company property,"

09:29.395 --> 09:32.594
"and assaulted others, earning a violent reputation."

09:33.094 --> 09:34.135
I know.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.865
Macheon's serial murder.

09:37.365 --> 09:38.464
That case, right?

09:38.905 --> 09:40.505
It was a hot topic nationwide,

09:40.505 --> 09:42.735
and the four major papers wrote about it.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.475
But that's not a good enough scoop.

09:48.475 --> 09:49.544
Then what?

09:51.544 --> 09:53.814
This is an expensive tip.

09:54.755 --> 09:57.125
What will you do for me if I give it to you?

09:58.855 --> 10:01.424
Well, then... Whatever.

10:03.265 --> 10:05.824
If you're not interested, leave it.

10:13.074 --> 10:14.105
My goodness.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.544
I'll tell just you.

10:21.714 --> 10:24.044
Instead of flowers, since I came empty-handed.

10:26.554 --> 10:28.554
Son Wan Ki's real scoop...

10:29.184 --> 10:30.785
came after that.

10:32.655 --> 10:34.155
On July 23.

10:34.824 --> 10:38.064
July 23. "Suspect Lee Sang Woo's family".

10:38.064 --> 10:39.365
(Exclusive Report)

10:39.564 --> 10:41.094
Son Wan Ki's exclusive report?

10:43.365 --> 10:44.635
("Who is he?")

10:45.204 --> 10:47.605
(The Demon Hidden Behind an Ordinary Face")

10:50.245 --> 10:51.245
What?

10:52.745 --> 10:54.475
He showed the suspect's wife too?

10:54.475 --> 10:56.714
That reporter was a lowlife.

10:56.714 --> 10:58.944
This was before he was questioned by the police.

10:59.414 --> 11:00.954
Is it legal to print this?

11:02.485 --> 11:04.424
Don't you presume people are innocent?

11:04.684 --> 11:06.554
This was the 1980s.

11:07.194 --> 11:09.794
You lived abroad, so you won't know.

11:10.895 --> 11:12.794
Korea was under a military regime then,

11:12.794 --> 11:14.434
so there was no law or human rights.

11:14.434 --> 11:15.765
The government reigned supreme.

11:17.265 --> 11:18.434
This Son Wan Ki...

11:19.464 --> 11:21.275
was a real jerk.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.044
I wonder what happened to her.

11:48.194 --> 11:49.235
Stop right there!

11:58.204 --> 11:59.505
When something is burnt,

12:00.214 --> 12:01.844
it can also mean purification.

12:02.674 --> 12:06.385
A lion's head, a goat's body, a snake's tail.

12:07.714 --> 12:09.824
It's an evil monster that kills...

12:10.885 --> 12:12.084
with its fiery breath.

12:17.895 --> 12:19.865
He was probably eaten alive by beasts.

12:23.564 --> 12:25.265
The beast that people keep.

12:26.105 --> 12:29.704
But the beast that also devours people.

12:32.044 --> 12:36.814
The beast that can grow bigger or smaller than people.

12:45.255 --> 12:46.324
Let go!

12:51.164 --> 12:53.265
You have to leave. You have to get out of there now!

12:54.934 --> 12:57.064
Wake up. Wake up, Jae Hwan!

13:00.174 --> 13:01.235
- Detective Cha. - No.

13:02.275 --> 13:03.275
Detective Cha.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.414
Sir.

13:13.755 --> 13:14.785
Are you all right?

13:18.855 --> 13:19.855
Agent Hathaway.

13:26.294 --> 13:28.334
Did you see the Chimera on the wall?

13:29.594 --> 13:31.964
The Macheon serial explosions from 35 years ago.

13:31.964 --> 13:33.775
It's the same Chimera, isn't it?

13:34.975 --> 13:38.174
I'm not sure if the similarities to the 35-year-old case...

13:38.975 --> 13:40.074
are a coincidence.

13:40.844 --> 13:43.245
The Chimera image, the use of oxygen,

13:43.985 --> 13:45.444
neither are common.

13:47.515 --> 13:49.485
How did the culprit prepare the oxygen...

13:49.485 --> 13:51.025
knowing I'd come over?

13:52.385 --> 13:55.694
It's possible you weren't the target.

14:00.094 --> 14:01.135
Then who is it?

14:01.265 --> 14:03.505
Do you think the killer will go after someone else?

14:04.064 --> 14:05.464
Someone else?

14:05.905 --> 14:08.934
Are you saying something similar could happen again?

14:12.804 --> 14:16.074
No. Is this just an occupational hazard?

14:23.855 --> 14:26.155
How about we look into the people around Son Wan Ki?

14:26.495 --> 14:28.625
Those he was closest to before he died.

14:30.164 --> 14:31.194
I don't know.

14:31.865 --> 14:34.464
Would a gambler have been close to anyone?

14:37.964 --> 14:39.005
Oh, right.

14:39.934 --> 14:40.975
That doctor.

14:41.275 --> 14:42.334
A doctor?

14:42.334 --> 14:44.204
They gambled together.

14:44.574 --> 14:46.814
He lost to Son Wan Ki on purpose.

14:47.314 --> 14:48.375
A doctor?

14:48.875 --> 14:49.944
From which hospital?

14:49.944 --> 14:52.714
I don't know if that's even his real job.

14:55.914 --> 14:57.324
A reporter and a doctor...

15:11.135 --> 15:12.464
Why not rest while you're down?

15:12.464 --> 15:14.905
Why are you leaving the hospital already?

15:15.605 --> 15:17.475
Why should I stay when they said I was fine?

15:17.775 --> 15:19.745
I applied for your sick leave.

15:19.745 --> 15:20.775
Take two more weeks off.

15:21.214 --> 15:24.084
Why would you do that when I'm not seriously wounded?

15:24.944 --> 15:26.714
Just listen to me, you punk.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.385
If you keep this up, you'll really end up getting sick.

15:32.584 --> 15:33.954
But Old Man.

15:34.395 --> 15:35.395
What?

15:35.694 --> 15:38.064
What were you doing there that day?

15:39.324 --> 15:41.135
What? Where?

15:41.594 --> 15:42.934
The culprit's hideout.

15:43.135 --> 15:44.535
I didn't tell you I was going there.

15:45.564 --> 15:47.735
Oh, that. Did I...

15:48.475 --> 15:50.245
hear about it from Gun Young?

15:50.605 --> 15:51.745
From Gun Young?

15:57.245 --> 15:59.584
If you're going to go, get ready. I'll take you home.

15:59.954 --> 16:02.414
You're going to take me home? Your car is all messed up.

16:02.814 --> 16:04.255
We can call a taxi.

16:04.554 --> 16:06.355
It's fine. Gun Young agreed to come.

16:08.495 --> 16:10.924
- Oh, right. Old Man. - What now?

16:11.125 --> 16:12.824
Didn't you say you worked...

16:13.495 --> 16:15.395
somewhere in Gyeonggi Province about 30 years ago?

16:17.464 --> 16:19.664
- Yes, so? - Are you aware of the Chimera Case?

16:21.005 --> 16:22.735
- What? - The Chimera Case.

16:23.135 --> 16:25.605
The serial arson case in Macheon, Gyeonggi Province.

16:27.745 --> 16:30.245
You know. There were a series of explosions in Macheon...

16:30.245 --> 16:31.714
and three people died.

16:32.015 --> 16:33.954
I heard everyone was talking about it back then.

16:34.584 --> 16:37.954
You punk. Where did you hear that nonsense?

16:37.954 --> 16:39.625
Were you internet surfing again?

16:40.155 --> 16:43.495
My gosh. Kids these days... Whether you're a cop or a criminal,

16:43.495 --> 16:45.895
you guys are always on your phones.

16:45.895 --> 16:47.035
No, it's not that.

16:48.395 --> 16:50.105
In the house that exploded,

16:50.434 --> 16:52.964
there was a huge drawing of Chimera on the wall.

16:54.674 --> 16:56.074
And the dead guy, Son Wan Ki,

16:56.074 --> 16:58.005
was the journalist who was looking into the Chimera case.

16:59.605 --> 17:01.544
Don't you remember anything?

17:01.544 --> 17:03.275
That's enough, you punk!

17:03.985 --> 17:06.484
You almost died!

17:06.584 --> 17:09.314
What is it? Is it worth risking your life over?

17:09.584 --> 17:11.554
What if something happens to you?

17:11.655 --> 17:13.895
What would happen to me? What about your mother?

17:16.794 --> 17:20.395
If you're going to run around acting like a reckless amateur,

17:20.395 --> 17:22.035
do it after I die.

17:22.035 --> 17:24.635
Do it after your mom and I die, you punk!

17:26.804 --> 17:29.005
You are so smart,

17:29.535 --> 17:32.044
but out of all the professions you could've chosen...

17:35.214 --> 17:36.374
Right.

17:38.314 --> 17:41.084
I'm the one to blame.

17:41.955 --> 17:45.255
Why are you saying that? What did you do wrong?

17:49.794 --> 17:51.495
Take care of yourself. Please.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.334
It's not me. It really isn't!

18:36.945 --> 18:38.874
- Get out here, you punk. - Get out!

18:38.874 --> 18:40.445
- Get out here! - Seriously.

18:40.445 --> 18:42.814
- Why did you do it? - Grab onto him!

18:42.874 --> 18:44.445
Why did you commit arson?

18:44.445 --> 18:46.445
My gosh. Move!

18:46.445 --> 18:48.154
Hold onto him!

18:48.154 --> 18:50.154
- Hold him. - Stop taking photos!

18:50.154 --> 18:52.624
- Gosh! Move! - Hold on.

18:52.824 --> 18:54.824
- Why did you do it? - Sir.

18:54.824 --> 18:56.255
I didn't do it!

18:56.255 --> 18:57.894
- Do you feel any guilt? - Move!

19:17.344 --> 19:18.584
Doesn't the water taste good?

19:19.685 --> 19:20.785
Get up.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.955
It wasn't me. It wasn't...

19:23.955 --> 19:25.054
Darn it!

19:28.725 --> 19:29.995
Aren't you going to admit it yet?

21:56.650 --> 21:58.991
Oh, right. Here.

22:02.890 --> 22:04.330
They're peaches.

22:53.410 --> 22:56.481
Apparently, it's a really nice place to live.

22:57.311 --> 23:01.420
It's not because he has a lot of money or anything.

24:16.461 --> 24:17.860
Son Wan Ki's case.

24:18.830 --> 24:20.301
They want to close it soon.

24:21.301 --> 24:23.031
What? Why?

24:23.031 --> 24:25.571
He said that out of nowhere this morning.

24:26.330 --> 24:29.170
We often asked him to close a case, but he has never done that first.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.910
Maybe he's getting softhearted just as he's about to retire.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.910
- That's odd. - Of course, it's odd.

24:35.910 --> 24:38.211
And of all people, you almost died.

In humanities, it's a monster in Greek mythology...

30:04.761 --> 30:06.390
that breathes fire.

30:07.060 --> 30:08.961
In genetics, it could mean that there are...

30:09.530 --> 30:11.461

30:14.471 --> 30:15.671
for laypeople to understand?

30:20.441 --> 30:22.610
Let's say there is a white rat and a black rat.

30:23.471 --> 30:25.580
Each rat should have one genetic trait,

30:25.580 --> 30:27.511
either white or black.

30:28.110 --> 30:31.481
But this means they have 1 white DNA and 1 black DNA.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.721
If that was a person,

30:35.850 --> 30:37.620
there could be a doctor who saves people...

30:49.570 --> 30:51.370
That happens when there are two personalities.

31:07.320 --> 31:08.421
Maybe.

31:09.251 --> 31:10.521
But he's very condescending.

31:10.860 --> 31:13.521

- Here you go. - Thank you.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.774
How long has he worked here?

37:53.874 --> 37:55.075
About six months?

37:55.745 --> 37:58.115
We scouted him from the UK.

37:59.115 --> 38:00.184
Oh.

38:00.684 --> 38:03.584
He brought someone saying he's a relative.

38:03.854 --> 38:05.155
A relative?

38:05.825 --> 38:08.254
I think it was this guy.

38:09.124 --> 38:12.365
He said they were related, but I felt something was off.

38:13.095 --> 38:15.135
- How so? - He was...

38:16.635 --> 38:19.664
He reeked of alcohol, kicked up a fuss, and cursed.

38:19.664 --> 38:22.135
He caused a huge mess in the ER that day.

38:22.374 --> 38:25.274
Can I see the ER records from that day?

38:27.274 --> 38:28.745
(Files)

38:28.745 --> 38:31.245
Here it is. Son Wan Ki.

38:32.414 --> 38:35.584
Doctor Lee paid for the treatment with his own credit card.

38:40.325 --> 38:42.624
Jae Hwan, you were out?

38:43.425 --> 38:44.695
Guess what this is.

38:45.095 --> 38:46.195
What is this?

38:46.664 --> 38:49.595
Proof that Lee Joong Yeop and Son Wan Ki knew each other.

38:50.064 --> 38:51.104
For real?

38:52.334 --> 38:53.705
(Bill and Receipt)

38:53.705 --> 38:56.635
He said he didn't know Son Wan Ki.

38:56.635 --> 38:57.805
It was a lie.

38:58.374 --> 39:00.405
That is suspicious,

39:00.644 --> 39:02.345
but it's not illegal to lie.

39:03.984 --> 39:06.285
I'm positive that this is our guy.

39:06.544 --> 39:08.285
I don't have anything to prove it.

39:10.055 --> 39:11.584
Should I follow him around?

39:17.195 --> 39:18.325
Where's the Old Man?

39:18.325 --> 39:20.964
He feels sick. He took time off.

39:20.964 --> 39:22.195
Is he very sick?

39:22.195 --> 39:24.805
I think so. He sounded weak.

40:03.874 --> 40:05.644
(The day of the Lord will come like a thief.)

40:23.995 --> 40:24.995
Hello?

40:26.524 --> 40:27.595
Who is this?

40:31.734 --> 40:32.964
Who are you?

40:34.705 --> 40:35.934
Who are you?

40:45.184 --> 40:46.214
Come out.

40:48.115 --> 40:49.584
Do you think I'm afraid?

40:51.225 --> 40:52.854
Show yourself!

41:01.164 --> 41:02.495
I'm sorry.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.805
I'm sorry.

41:18.745 --> 41:19.984
I'm sorry.

41:24.285 --> 41:25.584
I'm sorry.

43:08.408 --> 43:09.448
Is he asleep?

43:54.834 --> 43:57.745
(Old Man)

44:00.945 --> 44:03.414
Where did this old man go?

44:27.504 --> 44:29.975
Gosh, Shubert.

44:47.925 --> 44:49.024

46:18.714 --> 46:20.214
There's something I need to look into.

46:21.814 --> 46:23.155

No, I didn't.

47:45.734 --> 47:46.934
What's wrong, Jae Hwan?

47:49.374 --> 47:51.575
Captain Han has disappeared.

47:52.604 --> 47:53.644
What?

47:53.945 --> 47:54.945
He's not at home,

47:55.774 --> 47:57.845
and I haven't been able to reach him since yesterday.

48:01.254 --> 48:02.484
This is so unlike him.

48:03.254 --> 48:05.084

48:13.725 --> 48:14.734
How do you use this?

48:15.234 --> 48:18.135
Turn it on and the number that appears is the oxygen level.

48:18.135 --> 48:19.405
A number around 20 is normal.

48:19.934 --> 48:22.274
Oh, and Jae Hwan. If the number goes above 25, you have to get out.

48:33.914 --> 48:34.984
No, I didn't.

48:37.655 --> 48:40.725
Did you see any suspicious cars?

48:41.995 --> 48:43.024

Yes, it's me.

No. Don't come any closer.

We're okay. The oxygen levels are normal, and there are no sparks.

52:13.865 --> 52:14.905
Leave.

52:15.305 --> 52:17.675

55:08.445 --> 55:10.314

55:11.075 --> 55:12.914
for having to examine you myself to feel rest assured.

56:35.365 --> 56:37.894
Old Man, you need to work out a little.

56:41.504 --> 56:43.175
You remind me of a film.

56:43.874 --> 56:46.675
A film? Which one? "The Godfather"?

56:47.745 --> 56:48.845
Marlon Brando.

It's an adult film, isn't it?

57:19.403 --> 57:20.602
before I forget.

57:22.102 --> 57:23.672
I'll ask my mom to do it.

57:24.403 --> 57:26.803
You don't have to. It's too brazen of me.

57:27.343 --> 57:30.212
Think of how she slaved you away when her business flooded.

57:30.942 --> 57:32.642
That's because we're neighbors.

57:34.743 --> 57:36.252
We're supposed to help each other.
