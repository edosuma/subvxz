00:07.195 --> 00:08.749
I get two deaths here.

00:08.750 --> 00:13.790
I saw this woman walking
up and down the stairs.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.595
She's coming up the stairs,
coming up the stairs.

00:16.596 --> 00:19.332
My son Anthony was pushed
down a flight of stairs.

00:19.333 --> 00:22.228
There's a 10-year-old boy
living there in that room.

00:22.229 --> 00:23.736
Something ended here.

00:23.737 --> 00:26.119
She did die in this house.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.576
I have to find out what's going on.

00:27.577 --> 00:31.735
I'm telling you, you need
to leave this house.

00:31.736 --> 00:35.156
There is an evil presence.

00:35.306 --> 00:38.426
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.486 --> 00:39.920
There's something down there.

00:39.921 --> 00:41.369
I see dead people.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.529
He doesn't want me back there.

00:43.530 --> 00:45.548
I speak to dead people.

00:45.549 --> 00:46.927
She's pissed.

00:46.928 --> 00:48.244
And they speak to me.

00:48.245 --> 00:50.620
She doesn't like the people who live here.

00:50.621 --> 00:53.827
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:53.828 --> 00:55.538
Someone did hang themselves here.

00:55.539 --> 00:57.163
- Where?
- There.

00:57.164 --> 00:59.017
I rely on my partner.

00:59.018 --> 01:02.454
I'm Steve Dischiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:02.455 --> 01:03.733
Did you want to kill him?

01:03.734 --> 01:07.601
And I know every person, every house...
has secrets.

01:07.602 --> 01:09.506
She did die in this house.

01:09.507 --> 01:10.672
It's my job to reveal them.

01:10.673 --> 01:13.128
Would you be surprised if there
were bodies in this basement?

01:13.129 --> 01:13.955
No.

01:13.956 --> 01:15.496
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.497 --> 01:17.481
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.482 --> 01:19.066
Until the very end...

01:19.067 --> 01:20.183
Not good.

01:20.184 --> 01:22.386
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay
