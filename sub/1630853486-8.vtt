which will rendezvous with one
of their shuttles in orbit of the colony.

As the leader of your colony,
I would expect that you feel the same way.

36:22.397 --> 36:23.607
- Of course.

36:24.190 --> 36:29.696

just a little hard to believe

36:29.696 --> 36:33.325

about what happened to Topa.

Not even a guess?

If we have any hope of finding her,
we need to understand why she was taken.

Now, I could be wrong, Heveena,
but I think you're holding back.

36:51.802 --> 36:56.431
And if I'm right, I need to know
because Topa's life may depend on it.

36:58.809 --> 37:02.437

at stake here, Captain.

37:03.229 --> 37:06.483
Thousands of lives hang in the balance.

- Help how?

37:27.253 --> 37:31.967
- By acting as a link
within our communications network.

37:31.967 --> 37:34.845
I shared critical information with her.

37:35.888 --> 37:38.891
Somehow, Commander Kodon
must have discovered this

37:38.891 --> 37:40.767
and taken her for questioning.

37:40.767 --> 37:43.103
- What exactly does Topa know?

37:43.103 --> 37:46.481
- The name of our primary contact
on Moclus

37:46.481 --> 37:50.402
and the quantum frequencies
that we use to encrypt messages.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.122

38:02.122 --> 38:03.665

38:03.665 --> 38:05.918
- How could you put her in that position?
She's a child!

38:07.586 --> 38:11.257
- She is also a victim of Moclan bigotry!

38:11.257 --> 38:13.592
I gave Topa the opportunity

38:13.592 --> 38:17.263
to protect her own life as a female,

38:17.263 --> 38:19.806
and to protect
the lives of all the others!

38:19.806 --> 38:20.974
It was her choice!

She worships you!

38:25.104 --> 38:27.647
She would do anything to please you,
of course she's gonna say yes!

38:27.647 --> 38:31.068
- I am as concerned about Topa
as you are, Captain.

38:31.068 --> 38:34.113
But I do not regret enlisting her help.

38:34.113 --> 38:39.159
