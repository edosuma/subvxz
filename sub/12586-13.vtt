00:36.244 --> 00:38.788
Ladybird, stop licking my money.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.248
Dad, guess what?

00:40.331 --> 00:44.627
I finally saved enough money
to buy a brand-new Game Station.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.214
Your first major purchase.
Congratulations, Bobby.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.968
If you want, I can take you down
to Jensen's Electronics World.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.136
That's okay.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.512
I was looking on eBay

00:54.596 --> 00:57.682
and Gadget Champ
seems to have the best price.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.851
They sell your e-mail address

00:59.934 --> 01:01.811
-and pass the savings on to you.

01:01.895 --> 01:06.399
Bobby, you can't make major purchases
from a stranger on the Internet.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.692
If your game breaks down,

01:07.776 --> 01:10.653
do you think the Gadget Champ's
gonna come fix it?

01:10.737 --> 01:11.988
I don't know.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.615
Well, I do. He won't.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.825
Son, business is like life.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.577
You have to find people you trust

01:17.660 --> 01:19.079
and stay loyal to 'em.

01:19.162 --> 01:23.249
That's why I have a guy
for about every purchase I make.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.710
Phil Wilkerson for my insurance.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.837
Bill Honnell for my tools,

01:27.921 --> 01:29.506
-Eddie Holcomb for my...

01:29.589 --> 01:31.424
The car died, again.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.553
Luckily, Bill was right behind me
when it happened so he gave me a lift.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.598
Huh. He was behind you
the last time it broke down.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.308
Well, that's lucky.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.476
Uh, I guess.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.686
I need a new car, Hank.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.064

Well, all right.

01:46.147 --> 01:50.276
At least I get to take Bobby
to see my car guy, Tom Hammond.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.571
Son, I'm gonna show you
the right way to buy.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.614
Okay.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.326
I don't need to go anywhere else, Bill!

02:01.496 --> 02:04.165
Why don't they make brown cars anymore?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.500
This is it!

02:05.583 --> 02:08.294
Hank, I think I found my car.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.671


02:09.754 --> 02:12.048
A convertible?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.259
That's pretty funny, Peggy.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.263
Uh... Oh.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.056
It's my choice, right, Hank?

02:26.437 --> 02:28.565
Well, if I were you, I'd go big.

02:28.648 --> 02:33.570
A towering SUV says strength, power,
and in some subcultures of America,

02:33.653 --> 02:35.321
potent fertility.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.323
Uh...

02:37.407 --> 02:39.492
Peggy wants a convertible.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.704
She knows you're a heterosexual, right?

02:42.787 --> 02:44.539
It's Peggy's car.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.416
It's not like I'd ever be driving it.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.293
But it'll be in, your driveway.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.962
Uh, I hadn't considered that.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.006
Oh, good Lord.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.969
You see Bobby,
when you're a loyal customer

02:58.052 --> 02:59.304
of an established brick...

02:59.387 --> 03:00.555
...and mortar business,

03:00.638 --> 03:03.099
you can trust
that you're getting the best deal,

03:03.183 --> 03:04.976
on a car with a roof.

03:05.059 --> 03:08.521
Apparently, boring comes standard
on these models.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.524
Hank, these are just not doing it for me.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.984
Well, don't rush it.

03:13.067 --> 03:16.154
Consider all the factors,
including safety.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.906
Hank Hill, is that you?

03:17.989 --> 03:19.574
Well, get your butt over here.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.742
Well...

03:20.825 --> 03:22.994
Looks like I've been spotted.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.330
Better go get my hellos out of the way.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.969
Shall I box that up for you
or would you rather wear it home?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.096
Oh, I'd love to.

03:42.180 --> 03:46.017
But unfortunately, my husband
doesn't want me to buy a convertible.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.435
I bet your husband doesn't want you

03:47.518 --> 03:48.770
to vote either, does he?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.356
I'll tell you what.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.607
Why don't you come on in...

03:52.690 --> 03:55.276
...and see what
the 21st century feels like?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.536
Oh, yeah!

04:05.703 --> 04:07.121
I'll take it!

04:08.039 --> 04:09.916
Well, you know normally I would never

04:09.999 --> 04:11.751
let you ride on a lift like this,

04:11.834 --> 04:13.544
but since you're riding with Charlie,

04:13.628 --> 04:15.255
I know you're in good hands.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.257
Okay, ride's over, Bobby.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.424
Let's go buy a car.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.842
All right!

04:19.926 --> 04:22.011
Lower me down, Charlie.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.934
Just sign by the X's,
and this baby's all yours.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.852
Should I be doing this?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.647
A carefree convertible owner
would say yes.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.648
So...

04:33.731 --> 04:34.899
yes!

04:35.316 --> 04:39.404
Mmm. I'm sorry, but this is sticker price.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.615
Which according to my research
is way too high.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.909
You girls.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.120
What crazy research is that?

04:47.203 --> 04:52.125
A combination of Internet, phone calls,
and what I like to call, my horse sense.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.461
So let's talk business.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.298
Well, all right. How about this?

04:59.340 --> 05:01.009
That is close.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.844
But this...

05:02.927 --> 05:04.137
is closer.

05:06.973 --> 05:07.890
Hey, Hank.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.101
Hey, Mr. Draper.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.270
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.607
Boy, you wore me down, Peggy.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.901
Just in time. I was getting ready

05:18.985 --> 05:20.611
to pretend to walk out.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.198
Okay, just sign by the X's
and it's all yours.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.743
Peggy?

05:26.826 --> 05:29.120
Tom? What's going on here?

05:30.955 --> 05:32.623
I was buying a convertible.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.958
What?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.168
Hank Hill, you son of a gun.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.128
Why, I didn't know Peggy was your wife.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.713
Good to see you, partner.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.256
Well, it's good to see you, Tom.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.092
I just wish
it was under happier circumstance.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.512
Oh, I'm sorry,
I just got caught up in the moment.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.974
I guess because I just wanted it so bad.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.353
I'll go look at sedans.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.605
Mr. Hammond, do you have any brown ones?

05:55.688 --> 05:58.816
Well, now, hold on. You know what, Peggy?

05:58.900 --> 06:02.570
If you really want this car that bad,
then, well, then you should have it.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.447
-Really?
-Yep.

06:04.530 --> 06:08.493
Why don't you go get some water
and let me and Tom finish up this deal?

06:08.576 --> 06:12.497
Thank you, Hank!
I got him down to a really good price.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.415
Well, I'm sure you did.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.293
Bobby, I'd like you to meet Tom Hammond.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.629
My dad loves you so much!

06:27.136 --> 06:28.971
-He did it again!
I'll be!

06:29.055 --> 06:30.640
All right!

06:31.516 --> 06:33.184
Congratulations, Peggy!

06:33.267 --> 06:34.811
You should have been in there, Mom.

06:34.894 --> 06:39.565
They told stories, shook hands,
and then we got a new car.

06:41.859 --> 06:45.780
Now just remember not to tell anyone
about the deal I just gave you.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.199
This is the highest clearance, Hank.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.035
I know, level 10.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.997
Okay, since you're family,

06:55.081 --> 06:57.875
I think it's time I let you both in
on a little secret.

06:58.459 --> 07:01.796
Well, here it is, the Hank Hill special.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.673
Wait, that can't be right.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.675
That would mean you paid sticker price.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.802
And not a dime more. Right, Bobby?

07:07.885 --> 07:09.387
Right, Dad.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.514
Well, I'll see you both at home.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.058
Way to go!

07:14.142 --> 07:15.059
Congratulations!

07:27.822 --> 07:29.949
I love it!

07:30.074 --> 07:31.826
What's the matter, Peggy Hill?

07:31.909 --> 07:32.994
You don't like car?

07:33.077 --> 07:33.953
You should.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.037
It better than mine.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.706
No, I love the car.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.375
Bobby, you can practice
your parade wave later.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.294
-Run inside.
-Okay.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.297
Oh, this must be juicy. What is it?

07:44.380 --> 07:46.007
It's not the car.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.384
It's the price that Hank paid for it.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.386
Hank got his "special deal," right?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.139
Dale always talks about
Hank's special deal.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.183
He talks a lot about Hank.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.726
Well, as it turns out,

07:56.809 --> 08:00.188
his "special deal"
is really just sticker price.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.522
Sticker price?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.359
No one pays sticker price.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.778
You have to tell Hank Hill he's a chump.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.156
You can't let him keep getting ripped off.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.617
Oh, you can never tell Hank, sug.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.784
Can you imagine what he'd do
if he found out

08:13.868 --> 08:17.413
his friend's been lying
to him for 25 years?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.789
Nancy's right.

08:18.873 --> 08:19.874
It could get ugly.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.084
That forehead vein finally gonna go.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.879
I guess I will just have to take this
to my grave.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.465
And since I know things about each of you,

08:27.548 --> 08:29.175
I expect you to do the same.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.676
Redcorn.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.512
<i>Banxi kasae laywan lap.</i>

08:38.142 --> 08:39.018
Where are you going?

08:39.101 --> 08:42.730
We're going to get my Game Station
from Dad's electronics guy.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.607
You have an electronics guy too?

08:44.732 --> 08:47.193
Don't you shop around for anything?

08:47.735 --> 08:51.405
I mean, the new dishwasher,
you shopped around for that, right?

08:51.489 --> 08:54.200
Well, I let Jerry Biddle
at The Appliance Center

08:54.283 --> 08:56.619
do my comparative shopping for me.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.121
He said he personally checked every store

08:59.205 --> 09:02.750
in Heimlich County and couldn't find
anyone that could beat his deal.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.335
Fantastic.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.254
Hello, neighbors!

09:06.337 --> 09:08.923
So Hank, I hear you bought new car.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.883
Expensive, new car.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.345
-Oh, look, it's Ted Wassonasong.
-Ted?

09:14.428 --> 09:15.721
Where you see Ted?

09:19.183 --> 09:20.434
Hello, Uncle Hank.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.644
Is Aunt Peggy home?

09:21.727 --> 09:24.105
She's supposed to go with me
to buy a crib.

09:24.188 --> 09:27.483
I want it to be as much like my uterus
as possible.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.277
You should take Dad with you.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.531
He just bought Mom's car
for sticker price and not a dime more.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.866
-Sticker price?
-Oh, no!

09:35.950 --> 09:38.661
Dang it, Bobby,
that was supposed to be a secret.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.998
But Lucky always says that people
who pay sticker price...

09:42.081 --> 09:44.000
Okay, now, I will tell a secret.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.711
I have to use prescription deodorant!

09:46.794 --> 09:47.837
Sticker price?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.256
Everyone knows sticker price
is the sucker price.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.924
You're a sucker, Hank Hill!

09:52.008 --> 09:54.176
Okay, what's going on, Peggy?

09:55.553 --> 09:56.554
Everyone out.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.433
How much you pay for this pen, Hank Hill?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.315
Hank, I do not know
an easy way to say this,

10:07.398 --> 10:11.360
so I guess I will just say it
the slow and painful way.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.447
No one pays sticker price.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.949
Tom Hammond ripped you off

10:17.033 --> 10:20.286
and has been ripping you off
for the last 25 years.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.329
What?

10:21.412 --> 10:26.000
The price I was gonna pay
for that car was $2,500 lower

10:26.083 --> 10:27.793
than your "special deal."

10:27.877 --> 10:29.337
You overpaid for that car,

10:29.420 --> 10:32.673
and probably every car
that you've ever bought from him.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.013
So you're looking to buy a car, are you?

10:39.096 --> 10:40.348
Uh, yes, sir.

10:40.431 --> 10:44.727
But, uh, this is my first car,
so I don't really know what I'm doing.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.731
You see the price on that sticker?

10:48.814 --> 10:51.651
Well, that's the price
you're gonna pay for this car.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.403
Not a dime more for the football star.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.489
Wow! Well, thank you.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.324
Now, you've got to promise me you won't go

10:58.407 --> 11:00.576
telling anybody
about the deal I just gave you.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.626
Yup.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.752
Yup.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.087
Mm-hmm.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.464
I'm a chump. There, I said it.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.965
That's it, as your friend,

11:15.049 --> 11:19.011
I have no choice but to put you
on an immediate suicide watch, Hank.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.931
I'm not going to kill myself.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.016
Then I'm putting you homicide watch,

11:24.100 --> 11:28.187
because you're gonna kill something,
and if it's not yourself, it could be me.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.147
It seems like it's all good, man.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.400
Next thing you know them
dang ol' reporter come by talking 'bout,

11:32.483 --> 11:34.610
"Well, Hank always seemed like
a very quiet man, you know."

11:36.696 --> 11:37.822
Gun!

11:39.782 --> 11:42.034
<i>You too can be rich
like Dr. Money</i>

11:42.118 --> 11:44.036
<i>and have champagne for breakfast.</i>

11:44.120 --> 11:46.038
<i>And caviar for your cat.</i>

11:46.122 --> 11:47.456
<i>How much return do you want...</i>

11:47.540 --> 11:48.374
<i>...for your investment?</i>

11:48.457 --> 11:51.419
Maybe it's a good thing
this all happened, Hank.

11:51.502 --> 11:52.545
Bobby should know

11:52.628 --> 11:53.879
how things really work.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.508
Now at least when the world crushes him,
he'll see it coming.

11:57.591 --> 12:01.053
But I don't want the boy thinking
the world is a dishonest place.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.430
But sometimes it is.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.523
Come here, son.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.151
It's time I told you
how the world really works.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.362
If you don't mind
I'm gonna take your wallet,

12:18.446 --> 12:20.906
push you to the ground
and then kick you in the gut.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.826
Um, okay.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.872
No, no, dang it.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.707
It doesn't have to be this way.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.668
I'm gonna go see that bastard Tom Hammond.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.887
Oh, no! Hank Hill,
not two times in one month.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.638
Have mercy, man...

12:44.722 --> 12:45.890
...I've got a mortgage, for God's sake.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.768
Stop it, Tom. It's all over. I know.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.686
You know what, buddy?

12:50.770 --> 12:55.107
That you've been selling me a bag of lies
for the last 25 years.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.484
How could you, Tom?

12:58.944 --> 13:01.572
Well, what can I say, Hank?
I'm a salesman.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.574
I know, you're a salesman.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.993
That's why none of this makes any sense.

13:06.076 --> 13:11.582
Look, I just want the $2,500 back
that I overpaid for Peggy's car.

13:11.665 --> 13:15.085
I wish I could help you, Hank,
but the paperwork's already gone through.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.420
The deal's official.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.713
Dang it, Tom!

13:17.797 --> 13:20.925
You not only lied to me,
you lied to my son.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.343
How would your son feel

13:22.426 --> 13:24.845
if he came home from the Army and he...

13:24.929 --> 13:25.846
Wait a second.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.598
Is your boy even in the Army?

13:27.681 --> 13:30.601
Mm, my boy's a stand-up comedian.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.102
In Austin.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.063
But a deal's a deal, Hank.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.065
I don't believe this.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.735
You know what, Tom?
I'm going to teach you what loyalty means.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.028
Mark my words.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.584
Ain't it the truth?

13:55.668 --> 14:00.422
Yes, it is. And I'm telling you right now,
that Tom Hammond has got to be stopped.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.423
I know!

14:01.507 --> 14:03.300
I did a whole term paper on the damage...

14:03.384 --> 14:05.553
...people like Tom Hammond
are doing to the world.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.681
Well, there is no way
I'm letting Tom Hammond

14:08.764 --> 14:12.101
make this world a place
that don't want my son to live in.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.187
I want to join your fight.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.438
Well, all right.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.024
You can meet me
at the car lot at 5:00 a.m.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.943
5:00 a.m.?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.236
Okay.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.344
-Hey.
-Bah!

14:47.428 --> 14:49.763
It's me, Alex from the copy store.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.973
Who's that?

14:51.056 --> 14:52.391
And why are they crawling?

14:52.474 --> 14:54.685
That's Falcon and Sparrow, my friends.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.437
Man, we're so stoked!

14:56.520 --> 14:59.231
We had so much fun
coming up with code names last night.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.733
It feels so good

15:00.816 --> 15:01.817
to finally be doing something.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.611
Well, that's right, it sure does.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.363
Would have been better
if you guys had been on time, though.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.073
Now I've got to go get ready for work.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.993
We weren't late. We were hitting
the other side of the dealership.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.328
Oh, well, that's great.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.455
Well, I guess our work here is done.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.957
If you guys ever need
any propane, look me up.

15:19.668 --> 15:20.711
Propane?

15:20.794 --> 15:22.463
Aww, that would have been great!

15:22.546 --> 15:23.380
Well...

15:23.464 --> 15:24.465
Next time.

15:43.609 --> 15:47.363
Yep, Bobby, right about now,
the dealership should be opening up.

15:48.364 --> 15:52.284
I'd love to see Tom scrambling
to take all those flyers off the cars

15:52.368 --> 15:53.827
before the customers get there.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.872
Ooh, I'd love to see that cheater's face!

15:56.956 --> 16:00.751
Well, I am just glad
you did not drive my car through his ass.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.753
I didn't know
how you were going to do that,

16:02.836 --> 16:04.421
but you sounded serious.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.385
So how's your morning going, Hank?

16:09.468 --> 16:12.054
Pretty darn good,
I tell ya what, and yours, Dale?

16:12.137 --> 16:15.432
Well, Joseph went
to his first sleepover last night.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.601
Didn't go so well, he's a cuddler.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.269
So I had to go pick him up.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.063
Hmm, sorry to hear that.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.314
Not done.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.357
On our way home,

16:23.440 --> 16:26.694
we saw an explosion coming
from Tom Hammond's car lot.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.906
Then we saw what looked like your truck
driving away from the lot.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.824
What?

16:32.408 --> 16:33.701
So why'd you do it, Hank?

16:33.784 --> 16:37.496
And more importantly how,
because it looked like a really good job.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.248
Oh, Hank!

16:39.331 --> 16:40.958
You must cover your tracks.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.751
We'll have to kill Dale.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.420
There's nothing to cover up.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.215
I didn't blow up anything.
I was just passing out flyers.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.758
Dad, I'm confused.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.429
So you should trust people
until they betray you,

16:53.512 --> 16:55.305
and then try to blow them up?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.474
-Yes!
-No, Bobby!

16:57.558 --> 16:59.518
I wasn't trying to blow people up.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.187
I was just putting flyers on the cars.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.899
Alex and his friend, the Falcon,
must have done it after I left.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.027
Okay, okay.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.945
So you did not blow up the cars.

17:10.029 --> 17:15.075
You were just a disgruntled customer
hanging out with someone named the Falcon.

17:15.159 --> 17:19.329
Now, if that's the story we're going with,
that the story I will memorize.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.291
It's not a story, Peggy! It's the truth.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.001
I'm gonna go talk to the police

17:24.084 --> 17:25.669
and straighten this out.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.759
Excuse me, do you remember a tall,
sickly looking kid

17:31.842 --> 17:35.179
with one of those mustache beards
who was in here last night?

17:35.262 --> 17:36.180
You mean him?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.433
-No, that's not him.
-Him?

17:40.517 --> 17:41.602
Or him?

17:41.685 --> 17:44.938
Sir, we got a liberal arts college
and a halfway house down the road.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.607
You've got to be more specific.

17:46.690 --> 17:51.779
So Mr. Hill, how many sickly kids
did you say helped you blow up the lot?

17:51.862 --> 17:54.907
Three. Wait, they didn't help me
blow up the lot.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.700
They did it by themselves.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.951
So you were just the ringleader?

17:58.035 --> 18:00.621
No, I told you I didn't blow up anything.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.706
Wait, am I a suspect?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.792
Tell him no or he could lawyer up.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.752
<i>Frank,</i>

18:06.835 --> 18:08.545
<i>the video surveillance has been checked.</i>

18:08.629 --> 18:10.672
<i>We have a positive ID on the perp.</i>

18:10.756 --> 18:12.549
<i>The name's Hank Hill.</i>

18:12.633 --> 18:14.760
You probably heard that.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.932
I was just putting flyers on the cars.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.601
The other guys
were the ones blowing up the cars.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.020
By "other guys"
you mean the imaginary kids

18:25.104 --> 18:25.938
the cameras just...

18:26.021 --> 18:27.231
...happened to not pick up?

18:27.314 --> 18:30.609
The cameras didn't pick them up
because they were dressed in all black

18:30.692 --> 18:33.529
and most of the time they were crawling
around on their bellies.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.863
I'll give it to you straight, Hank.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.490
You're looking at major time for this.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.076
And the hole's getting deeper
with every lie you tell.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.536
That's not my husband!

18:41.703 --> 18:42.871
What's my next line?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.164
I'm blanking, Hank.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.290
Okay, enough.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.750
It is me on the tape.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.544
Goodbye, Hank!

18:48.752 --> 18:52.506
But I swear to you
I did not blow up any cars.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.842
I was just putting flyers on the cars

18:54.925 --> 18:57.010
because I wanted other people to know

18:57.094 --> 18:57.928
Tom Hammond...

18:58.011 --> 18:58.929
...has been taking advantage of...

18:59.012 --> 19:00.430
Stop right there, Hank.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.183
Well, speak of the devil, and Charlie too.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.854
Officer Brown, that's the lying,
cheating man you should be arresting.

19:06.937 --> 19:11.400
I know you're mad, Hank, but I didn't
think you'd be mad enough to torch my lot.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.153
The only thing I'm guilty of
is trusting you.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.781
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
I may go to jail, but I've zipped my lips

19:17.865 --> 19:19.074
for the last time.

19:23.036 --> 19:26.790
J.B., I've been in business
with Hank Hill for 25 years.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.918
If he says he didn't do it,
then by God, he didn't do it.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.714
Can we at least
watch the rest of the tape, Tom?

19:33.797 --> 19:37.509
Do you know how many strings I had to pull
to get the conference room with the VCR?

19:37.593 --> 19:40.053
There's no need.
Now I'm not pressing charges.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.431
Hank's the most honest man I know.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.557
If he looks you in the eye,

19:43.640 --> 19:46.101
and shakes your hand
and tells you he didn't do something,

19:46.185 --> 19:47.686
then he didn't do it.

19:54.276 --> 19:57.154
So what say we just
leave this all behind us, Hank?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.158
Let's go home, Peggy.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.499
You really believe he's innocent, Tom?

20:09.583 --> 20:13.712
Hell, no. But, I know Hank.
He will not let this die.

20:13.795 --> 20:14.880
He'd fight us all the way.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.841
Hell, he'd be up at the Supreme Court
telling Judge Scalia

20:17.925 --> 20:19.760
that I gouge my damn customers.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.429
Do you know
what that could do to my business?

20:22.512 --> 20:23.597
It ain't worth it.

20:24.473 --> 20:28.393
I sold that man five cars
at sticker price.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.646
All in all, it was a pretty good run.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.775
KID:<i> Dad, I want to get a new video...</i>

20:34.900 --> 20:37.402
Hey, I'm Chet Haddock.
What can I do for you?

20:37.486 --> 20:39.488
Hi, Chet, my name's Hank Hill.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.031
That name sounds familiar.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.702
Oh, right.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.955
Uh, how can I help you, sir?

20:48.038 --> 20:49.248
By helping my son.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.250
Hey, Chet, I'm Bobby Hill,

20:51.333 --> 20:54.127
and I'm interested
in buying a Game Station.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.380
Is this the best price you can give me?

21:00.175 --> 21:05.097
After I take another 10,
no, 20 percent off, it will be.

21:05.180 --> 21:09.518
Chet, looks like you're gonna be
my electronics guy.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.854
-<i>Hank always seemed like
a very qulet man,</i><i>you know</i>.
