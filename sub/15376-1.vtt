00:51.618 --> 00:54.887
<i>I know you have
a lot of girls talking to you.</i>

00:54.889 --> 00:57.656
Why don't we go back
to my place?

01:01.861 --> 01:03.095
I wanna explore

01:03.097 --> 01:05.798
every inch of your body.

01:10.303 --> 01:13.572
Will you just fuck me?

01:14.741 --> 01:17.609
You're suffering from OSD,

01:17.611 --> 01:20.412
which is obsessive
sexual desires.

01:20.414 --> 01:24.049
So I'd like for you
to read my book.

01:24.051 --> 01:27.119
This book will show you
how to rechannel

01:27.121 --> 01:28.720
those negative sexual impulses.

01:28.722 --> 01:33.792
Example: Instead of copulation,
try communication.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.329
I had a patient who
was addicted to group sex,

01:37.331 --> 01:40.732
and he read this book,
and it changed him so much

01:40.734 --> 01:43.235
that he just recently
climbed mt. Everest.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.937
Wow, that's amazing.

01:44.939 --> 01:47.506
He ended up having a three-way
with a couple of Sherpas,

01:47.508 --> 01:51.276
so there's still work to be
done, because it is a process.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.645
I want to help you
climb your Everest,

01:53.647 --> 01:57.816
because I know that
there is a... amazing,

01:57.818 --> 02:01.386
productive, confident
woman inside of you.

02:01.388 --> 02:05.791
It's just waiting to break free.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.293
Will you read the book?

02:08.294 --> 02:11.497
Put your balls in my mouth.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.969
Idea for a chapter in new book:

04:30.971 --> 04:35.507
How important is sex
to being a man?

04:40.346 --> 04:44.182
Note for chapter in new book:

04:44.184 --> 04:48.553
What's more important in a man,
the mental or the physical?

04:48.555 --> 04:51.690
Idea for chapter in next book:

04:51.692 --> 04:57.062
Can you truly be an adult
without experiencing sex?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.463
Another chapter:

04:58.465 --> 05:02.000
Can a person be truly happy
without sex?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.206
- Hey, doc.
- Hey, Josh.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.475
So I took your advice
and invited Becky to a movie,

05:10.477 --> 05:11.843
and she said yes.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.546
- That's great.
- She brought a friend.

05:14.548 --> 05:17.349
Ooh. Well, doesn't mean
she doesn't like you.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.384
Girls just want
their friends' approval.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.887
- It was a guy. They made out.
- Jesus.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.823
Then he fingered her
under her jacket.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.425
Oh... you okay?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.360
I was really bummed,
but when I got home,

05:28.362 --> 05:30.429
I just jerked off
into a sock, so...

05:30.431 --> 05:32.964
It may seem trite right now,
but I promise you,

05:32.966 --> 05:34.833
there's plenty of fish
in the sea.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.835
And plenty of socks
in the drawer.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.205
- There you go, buddy.
- Catch you later.

05:40.207 --> 05:43.942
How do you exist moment to moment
when you're not a goldfish?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.244
- Thanks.
- -That's not a compliment.

05:46.246 --> 05:49.748
Guys? Can we at least text whenever
we're coming over, please?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.017
- You gave us a key.
- I know, but remember?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.819
We talked about this.
That's for emergencies.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.521
Jenny thinks I'm at work
till 8:00.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.056
This is emergency fun time.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.392
You know, it's the kids.
I love 'em,

06:00.394 --> 06:02.427
but we have, like,
so little in common.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.995
They're into cartoons
and crayons,

06:03.997 --> 06:06.531
and I'm just not
into that shit right now.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.533
And, Luke, what's your excuse?

06:08.535 --> 06:11.403
Rachel's over picking up
the rest of her stuff.

06:11.405 --> 06:15.207
Clothes, furniture, and everything
else we shared together.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.610
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.679
No, I'm great.
You think she's my type?

06:20.681 --> 06:23.582
Yeah, she's everyone's type.
Swipe right on that.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.717
Man, if I had knew dating
was like this today,

06:25.719 --> 06:28.019
I wouldn't have been so afraid
to break up with Rachel.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.223
- She broke up with you. -Right.
'Cause I was so afraid of her.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.859
My point is thought that
this is like a whole new world.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.594
Pete, you gotta
get on this, man.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.729
I'll make you an account.
It's so easy.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.765
What the hell
are you guys watching?

06:39.767 --> 06:42.968
<i>Valkyrie.</i> I think
they're about to kill Hitler.

06:42.970 --> 06:47.239
Spoiler alert!
I haven't seen this movie yet.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.840
- What...
- I have a job and kids.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.243
I don't watch every fucking
movie that comes out.

06:51.245 --> 06:55.013
- But Hitler dies. -Don't...!
I'm trying to forget it.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.249
Michelle's actually having
some people over at her house

06:57.251 --> 06:59.151
and she's testing some new dishes,
so I promised to go over.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.019
- I'm sorry, but I have to leave.
- That's great.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.888
Just make sure you
smile a lot. Or, hey,

07:02.890 --> 07:05.257
we could just kill Charlie
and then you could ask her out.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.326
Wait, wait, wait. Are there gonna
be beautiful honeys there?

07:08.328 --> 07:10.762
Let's do cousins. Wait,
no one's gonna believe that.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.566
We're second cousins, I live in
New York, I'm into textiles.

07:14.568 --> 07:18.170
- Oh, girls love textiles.
- I'm not gonna help you cheat.

07:18.172 --> 07:22.974
No, no, no. Don't wanna cheat, just
wanna flirt. Catch and release.

07:22.976 --> 07:26.912
See if Batman can still
fight crime, you know?

07:26.914 --> 07:29.548
See if Ali can still
sting like a bee.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.350
Can't do it. I'm sorry. What about
you, Luke? Do you wanna go?

07:32.352 --> 07:35.921
Man, I would love to, really,
but I'm kind of on a roll here.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.924
Tonight will be six nights
in a row and I just kinda feel

07:38.926 --> 07:41.159
like I have an obligation
for the tinder record.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.094
- What's the tinder record?
- Seventy-one.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.997
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah, definitely go for that.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.900
Right? I just feel
like I haven't done much

07:48.902 --> 07:51.536
with my life
and this could be my thing.

07:51.538 --> 07:55.807
You gotta do it for my dick. You gotta
do it for the dicks of all of us.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.215
Hey, Nikki.

08:03.217 --> 08:05.584
Do you hate me?
You came alone.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.386
No. Oh, I was supposed
to bring a plus-one.

08:08.388 --> 08:12.290
Yes, you were supposed to bring a charming,
single, wildly employed friend of yours.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.526
Right. Well, one of
my friends is married,

08:14.528 --> 08:18.029
the other one just got tinder,
so he's a little preoccupied.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.664
How is he getting on?
Any luck?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.233
Because my sister
met her boyfriend on there.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.034
He's actually,
I would say professionally,

08:23.036 --> 08:25.337
getting a little too lucky,
if you know what I mean.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.806
It's good to see you, Nikki. I see
Michelle. I'm gonna go say hi.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.307
Uh-huh.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.043
You're carrying that ball
like a newborn baby, you dick!

08:32.044 --> 08:34.044
- Hey, Charlie. -That was a four
step lay-up! That was blatant!

08:34.047 --> 08:37.883
I'm watching on a fucking
phone and I saw it!

08:37.885 --> 08:41.852
Yeah, no shit, it was a travel.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.587
What is he,
a goddamn running back?

08:43.590 --> 08:45.557
Listen, get Connelly
to come up with a pic,

08:45.559 --> 08:48.460
put it on the home page in 31
seconds, or I'm gonna tell your wife

08:48.462 --> 08:51.029
that the stain in the backseat
of your car is hooker blood.

08:51.031 --> 08:55.033
Okay? Yeah, not kidding.
Holy shit, I am pissed.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.869
Worst officiating since
the Kennedy assassination.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.238
What's up?
What do you need?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.240
I... I'm Pete,
Michelle's neighbor.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.576
Okay. Pleasure to meet you,
Pete, Michelle's neighbor.

09:04.578 --> 09:08.280
- We've met a few times. Yeah.
- Oh, really? No shit, huh?

09:08.282 --> 09:10.682
Wow. I do it all the time.
Hate when I do that.

09:10.684 --> 09:15.487
Listen, gotta get back to
the game. It's for work, okay?

09:15.489 --> 09:18.056
- Hi!
- Got you some wine.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.959
Aw, thanks. I just opened up
a bottle of wine. Want a glass?

09:20.961 --> 09:24.095
Yes. You keep working
and I'll pour us a glass.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.431
Ooh, try this.

09:26.433 --> 09:31.202
- Huh?
- Alright.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.238
Mm. Oh, my god.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.973
Yeah? You're not
just saying that?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.175
My taste buds are celebrating
as if they've

09:37.177 --> 09:40.412
been rescued from evil.
What the hell is that?

09:40.414 --> 09:43.682
It's a Chile en Nogada.
It's insane prep, three days,

09:43.684 --> 09:46.084
but it's totally
worth it, right?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.987
You cannot waste this genius
on me and your semi-odd friends.

09:48.989 --> 09:52.357
I don't know.
I'm... not ready.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.526
You say that,
but if you don't start now,

09:54.528 --> 09:57.195
you're never gonna have your own
restaurant with a nice big blackboard

09:57.197 --> 09:59.431
with all your specials
for the day

09:59.433 --> 10:03.635
and some nice food-based puns
like "no country for old hens."

10:03.637 --> 10:06.104
- Or "Ace tempura."
- "The Codfather."

10:06.106 --> 10:09.541
"American snapper,"
"you've got Kale"...

10:09.543 --> 10:11.376
- "Raisin Arizona." Um...

10:11.378 --> 10:13.979
- I'll work on it.
- But the music, I gotta say,

10:13.981 --> 10:15.780
I'll make the mix for you.
It'll be great.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.916
Well, yeah,
you're in charge of that.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.652
I can't leave that to you.
You really are ready.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.121
- You really think so?
- Oh, yeah.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.958
- Mm!
- Oh, god! That did not hurt.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.461
- It was my head. Ahem.
- Oh, you want some medicine?

10:29.463 --> 10:32.664
No, no, I'm fine. People have had
headaches before, believe it or not.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.766
- No!
- Yes. Cheers.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.067
You should probably
see a doctor.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.136
You should probably
shut the fuck up.

10:38.138 --> 10:42.207
Hey, sorry, babe.
Sorry, game's been crazy.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.043
That's okay. You said you
weren't gonna work tonight.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.680
I know, but remember, it's a big game. I
was supposed to be there, but I'm not.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.749
I'm here and I'm glad
to be here. Look at this.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.250
Phone? Going on mute.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.320
- Huh? You like that? Yeah?
- Wow.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.789
Ooh, fancy cookin',
good lookin'.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.457
What is that?
What you got going on there?

10:59.459 --> 11:00.925
- Well, try it.
- Yeah?

11:00.927 --> 11:05.130
What the hell's that?

11:05.132 --> 11:09.734
My other phone. I forgot
to turn off my other phone.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.736
Babe, I'm so sorry,
I have to take this.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.139
- It's okay.
- Two seconds, I swear, okay?

11:14.141 --> 11:16.908
I promise, two seconds.
Connelly.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.910
Shut up and tell me!

11:18.912 --> 11:24.783
- It's really good.
- Thanks.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.419
Another chapter:

11:27.421 --> 11:31.256
Can there be romantic love...

11:31.258 --> 11:34.859
Without sex?

11:44.804 --> 11:48.573
Brenda, the boy's here.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.508
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, pal.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.777
Hey!

11:52.779 --> 11:57.048
Namaste. My beautiful boy!

11:57.050 --> 11:59.617
- I made your favorite brownies.
- Mm...

11:59.619 --> 12:03.354
Okay, tell me, did you do
any sexual healing today?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.390
Do we have to constantly
celebrate what the boy does?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.892
Hey, hon, I just
asked him about work.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.228
Excuse me for being proud
of our son.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.864
Yep, he suppresses
people's natural desires.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.366
- Strike up the band.
- Did I tell you this?

12:15.368 --> 12:18.336
Carmen was complaining the other
day about her husband's needs,

12:18.338 --> 12:20.305
and then I gave her a copy
of the book.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.742
Turns out, he totally is
rechanneling his sexual energy,

12:23.744 --> 12:25.376
putting it into his gardening.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.579
She brought a squash here
the other night,

12:27.581 --> 12:30.348
- that zucchini that was huge.
- I get the connection.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.518
Anyway, do you want
to stay for dinner, hon?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.386
I can't, I have plans.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.389
Plans? Like a woman plans?

12:38.391 --> 12:41.159
It's not like that, mom.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.962
I worry about you
that you work so much,

12:43.964 --> 12:46.030
you never have time
for a girlfriend.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.933
Alright, that's my cue.
I gotta go.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.636
- Good to see you, dad. See you.
- See you, pal.

12:51.638 --> 12:55.340
- Bye. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:58.911 --> 13:01.613
Why do you have
to be so negative?

13:01.615 --> 13:06.751
Pete's very successful. Why don't
you just accept him for who he is?

13:06.753 --> 13:10.955
I don't know who he is. He's not the
man I tried to raise him to be.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.658
Well, okay. Maybe he's
not sporty like you are.

13:13.660 --> 13:18.096
You know, he's light and sweet
and spiritual and cute,

13:18.098 --> 13:20.431
and what better son
could you ask for?

13:20.433 --> 13:23.968
How about the kind I could make
some sense of to begin with?

13:23.970 --> 13:28.706
You know? I mean, who writes books about
sex and has never had a girlfriend?

13:28.708 --> 13:33.444
And if he's gay, okay, great.
Our son is gay, yippee.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.246
But this is...

13:35.248 --> 13:40.118
I mean, he's... he's...

13:40.120 --> 13:43.922
I don't know what he is.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.657
What'd you wanna
see me about, boss?

13:45.659 --> 13:50.195
You're a superstar.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.697
- I just got the call.
- What? What is it?

13:52.699 --> 13:55.767
Oh, I can't stand it.
You're doing a Ned talk!

13:55.769 --> 13:58.136
How? How did that...
How did that...?

13:58.138 --> 14:01.239
Wh-what... what...? How...?
Did they just call, or...

14:01.241 --> 14:03.775
They don't just call anybody!

14:03.777 --> 14:07.145
I submitted you,
you nutty genius.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.214
You and your marvelous book.

14:09.216 --> 14:13.151
I would've told you earlier, but I
was afraid they would reject you.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.020
And there was a very
strong possibility of that.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.490
But they didn't.
They accepted us.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.959
- Oh, my god.
- Wow!

14:20.961 --> 14:24.028
This so amazing for me!
And for you!

14:24.030 --> 14:26.331
Your book is gonna reach
millions of people now.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.099
It's gonna be so good
for the clinic.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.602
- That is amazing.
- And that's not all.

14:30.604 --> 14:36.107
- There's more? -Don't freak out, okay?
Promise me.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.977
Someone pretty important...

14:38.979 --> 14:44.649
At m... p...

14:44.651 --> 14:47.318
r wants to interview you.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.920
Noema Willcoxen?

14:48.922 --> 14:51.623
She wants to
interview you about me,

14:51.625 --> 14:53.491
and what we do here.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.126
I'm so excited.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.395
Noema Willcoxen, wow.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.399
How could she say no, huh,
to the new Tony Robbins?

15:01.401 --> 15:04.068
Yeah, that's... that is...

15:04.070 --> 15:06.838
This is happening!

15:06.840 --> 15:11.843
Thank you so much for all
your support, Caroline,

15:11.845 --> 15:13.745
- what you've done for me.
- Well, you know, it wasn't easy.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.648
- I... -There were a
lot of moving parts.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.951
I mean, logistically,
this has been a nightmare.

15:19.953 --> 15:24.689
But I'm so glad
that I made it happen.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.658
So that's it?
- It's just over?

15:26.660 --> 15:29.394
- You gotta be kidding me!
- -Just go!

15:32.565 --> 15:34.065
Un-fucking-believable.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.135
She won't even
fucking listen to me.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.705
It's just work, you know?
Women.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.908
You're fucking lucky
that you date dudes.

15:43.910 --> 15:47.779
- No, I'm not... -I'm actually
dead serious about that.

15:47.781 --> 15:52.150
I don't...

15:52.152 --> 15:54.585
Go away!

15:54.587 --> 15:59.724
Michelle, it's Pete.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.026
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:09.635 --> 16:13.004
Uh, yeah, come on in.
I'm drinking some wine.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.707
- Want a glass?
- Sure.

16:15.709 --> 16:18.910
God, I don't even know
why I'm still crying.

16:18.912 --> 16:22.313
So stupid.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.384
- Is white okay?
- Sounds great.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.087
Okay.

16:29.089 --> 16:33.491
I really mean it.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.061
I gotta be done with this guy.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.931
Whatever the hell
Charlie and I had...

16:39.933 --> 16:42.266
It's not what I want.

16:42.268 --> 16:46.270
I don't really think that love
is supposed to feel like this.

16:49.074 --> 16:54.078
What does it feel like?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.681
Well, you know
what love feels like.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.984
Yes, of course. I mean...

16:59.986 --> 17:04.655
I meant, what does it feel
like when you're with Charlie?

17:06.659 --> 17:11.529
I feel...

17:11.531 --> 17:14.464
alone.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.402
His work and himself,
it always comes first.

17:17.404 --> 17:20.405
It's his entire world.
And, no,

17:20.406 --> 17:24.409
it's not even about that.
I'm just...

17:24.411 --> 17:26.544
I'm tired of being
an afterthought.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.581
- Yeah.
- Let's sit.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.760
Michelle, I've known you
for a few years,

17:42.762 --> 17:45.496
and you're pretty damn amazing.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.398
You're kind, you're funny.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.168
- I'm hilarious.
- You are hilarious.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.938
And you're not too difficult to
look at, if you know what I mean.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.942
And I do think Charlie does
love you, in his own way.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.078
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.082
But if he keeps
making you feel unnecessary?

18:04.084 --> 18:08.486
God, ask me to make a great paella
and I'll blow your fucking mind,

18:10.222 --> 18:14.725
but treat me like a doormat, and
I'm obviously falling to pieces.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.401
I know what I need now.

18:23.403 --> 18:29.207
- Some more wine?
- No.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.775
I need to become a chef.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.177
I need to transfer
all of this energy

18:33.179 --> 18:39.217
and this sadness into something
that I know that I really want...

18:39.219 --> 18:41.252
And I know that I can do.

18:41.254 --> 18:46.891
That's a fucking great idea.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.293
- Thank you.
- Of course.

18:49.295 --> 18:53.998
I don't know what
I would do without you.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.535
You'd do the same for me,
wouldn't you? Yeah.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.181
- I'm sorry.
- I...

19:10.183 --> 19:11.616
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

19:11.618 --> 19:16.320
- I'm sorry, but i...
- No, no.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.690
- It's okay. Are you okay?
- No, I... my head is...

19:19.692 --> 19:22.527
I think the wine or something...
But can I call you tomorrow?

19:22.529 --> 19:26.497
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you. Sorry.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.591
What the hell's wrong with me?

20:02.801 --> 20:04.335
Pete?

20:04.337 --> 20:06.304
- Pete, wake up!
- -Wake-upsies!

20:06.306 --> 20:08.072
- Your friends are here, Pete!
- Wake up!

20:08.074 --> 20:10.808
- Hi, Pete! -Oh, my god, Pete!
It's an emergency!

20:10.810 --> 20:13.444
- What happened?!
- I was talking to him!

20:13.446 --> 20:16.480
- Pete! Hey...
- Hey, buddy, how are you?

20:16.482 --> 20:18.216
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

20:18.218 --> 20:19.483
We have a basketball game

20:19.485 --> 20:20.818
and you're not dressed.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.455
I have a massive...
Headache right now,

20:24.457 --> 20:27.558
so I want you to turn around
and leave my house...

20:27.560 --> 20:29.560
Not gonna happen. Left Jenny
and the kids at home

20:29.562 --> 20:31.329
to play three-on-three
with you guys.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.599
If I go home and haven't played
basketball, she's gonna know,

20:34.601 --> 20:37.235
then it's gonna be considered
non-basketball-related "me time"

20:37.237 --> 20:40.504
and then she's gonna want
non-activity-related "her time,"

20:40.506 --> 20:42.473
and it's gonna upset
the whole ecosystem.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.943
- It's a whole thing, so get up.
- Okay, I will go.

20:45.945 --> 20:51.315
Did you get food?

20:51.317 --> 20:55.786
- Who is it?
- It's Michelle. Hold on.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.688
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.691
Um...

21:00.693 --> 21:05.496
Listen, I just... I just
wanted to say... thank you.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.266
Thank you for being
there for me yesterday.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.801
It's Pete, you know...?

21:10.803 --> 21:13.104
- He's right, it's Michelle.
- I figured he wouldn't be lying.

21:13.106 --> 21:17.041
- But what's the vibe? -Well, it's
kinda casual. Like, not very fancy.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.143
So they're not at a fancy
restaurant out there?

21:19.145 --> 21:20.544
No, she's not dressed up
or anything.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.513
I just really needed
to talk to somebody,

21:22.515 --> 21:24.715
and... I really only wanted
to talk to you.

21:24.717 --> 21:28.219
So I really appreciate
that you were there.

21:28.221 --> 21:31.322
And sorry if, you know,
things got weird,

21:31.324 --> 21:34.525
and, you know,
like, we kissed and stuff,

21:34.527 --> 21:38.462
- or whatever.
- I'm here for you.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.406
She went in for an emotional hug

21:48.408 --> 21:52.076
and he chose...
A back-slapper.

21:52.078 --> 21:56.314
He wants cock. I don't understand why
he just won't embrace some cock.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.715
Let him have cock
if he wants cock.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.751
Okay, $47 to stop
saying cock, okay?

22:00.753 --> 22:02.753
Have you ever seen him
look twice at a dude? No.

22:02.755 --> 22:06.657
Enough with the gay thing. We're
not children. Don't say "cock."

22:06.659 --> 22:09.060
- Cock.
- Don't...!

22:09.062 --> 22:11.395
- Sorry, I didn't mean to.
- Say cock!

22:11.397 --> 22:14.598
Cock, cock, cock,
cock, cock, cock, cock...

22:15.734 --> 22:17.835
Seriously,
why won't you even try?

22:17.837 --> 22:21.072
I mean, fresh off a breakup,
that's strike time!

22:21.074 --> 22:23.107
- I mean, that's when you do it.
- Yeah, go for it.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.642
Sure, that's what you would do.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.377
You would take advantage
of the situation.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.814
I believe that Michelle needed
actual kindness last night.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.849
- No. I bet she didn't.
- Genuine kindness.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.584
- I bet what she wanted...
- Was penis.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.219
Yeah, was a nice penis.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.788
Do you really wanna be the guy
that women confide in?

22:37.790 --> 22:40.124
- Oh, god, no. No, no, no.
- Yeah, you don't.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.993
Then I'd have to make a highly
successful career out of that.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.562
Alright, you don't have
to say "highly successful."

22:44.564 --> 22:47.298
Michelle confides in me
because she trusts me.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.434
- That's the point. -Yeah, but
therapists can be fucked up

22:50.436 --> 22:53.437
in their personal lives, too.
I mean, Freud banged his mom.

22:53.439 --> 22:57.708
- You're an idiot. -Mm-hmm. Pretty
sure they wrote a play about it.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.711
So it's nine days in Santa Barbara that
could potentially change your life.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.580
What's there to think about?

23:02.582 --> 23:06.250
Nine days? I'll never get that
time off from the gallery.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.185
Oh, yes, you will, if you ask.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.988
You haven't taken a vacation
since I've known you.

23:10.990 --> 23:15.192
Besides, it's not a vacation,
it's the start of your career.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.429
Now you sound like Pete. He'd
be so thrilled if I did this.

23:18.431 --> 23:22.566
- Okay, about Pete...
- He's not gay.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.835
I think he's a serial killer.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.604
I do.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.439
He's always 'round here
mincing around

23:28.441 --> 23:31.242
with that small waist.
Ugh. Creepy.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.544
And the way he looks at you,
that's not love.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.079
He's clocking your every move.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.848
I don't like it.
I don't like it, Michelle.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.317
And he dresses better
than both of us.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.153
That is gay or serial killer.

23:42.155 --> 23:45.055
Well, I think that he's very...

23:45.057 --> 23:47.224
Kind and he's genuine.

23:47.226 --> 23:51.362
And when I'm around him,
I feel... I feel safe.

23:51.364 --> 23:54.698
Listen, I'm sorry,
at some point, guys need sex.

23:54.700 --> 23:58.569
- Have you tried it on with him?
- Last night, I was...

23:58.571 --> 24:01.071
I was feeling really shitty about
the whole Charlie situation

24:01.073 --> 24:05.910
and I was feeling very vulnerable, and...
I kissed him.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.678
Mm-hmm.

24:07.680 --> 24:11.615
And he didn't
take advantage of that.

24:14.019 --> 24:17.188
Classic serial killer.

24:17.190 --> 24:21.725
- Ooh! Welcome back, ladies.
- Double or nothing.

24:21.727 --> 24:25.930
- Okay, $200 it is. -Remind me why
you assholes didn't pay last time?

24:25.932 --> 24:27.932
'Cause your mother
needed help with the rent.

24:27.934 --> 24:31.569
Okay, let's leave the mothers
out of it today, rich,

24:31.571 --> 24:35.539
and let's get our head in the game,
play a little basketball, okay?

24:35.541 --> 24:37.374
You heard dickless, let's go.

24:43.915 --> 24:45.182
Oh!

25:03.703 --> 25:06.537
Yeah! Straight out
of cobra, bitch!

25:45.545 --> 25:47.344
- What time do you get off?
- Midnight.

25:47.346 --> 25:49.446
- Luke, she's working.
- Took a shot to the nuts.

25:49.448 --> 25:50.848
Might've also dinged his melon,

25:50.850 --> 25:53.250
'cause he dropped
like a box of rocks.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.819
Alright, just checking
for internal bleeding.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.922
Just to be safe,
let's order up a cat scan.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.157
- How's your insurance?
- I'm a PHD.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.259
Yahtzee. You know what?
Make it a cat scan and an MRI.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.296
- My head is fine. -Look, we
just need to be certain,

26:05.298 --> 26:07.731
so just take it easy, alright? I'm
gonna do a quick examination.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.601
Just try to relax for me. Nurse,
let's take a closer look, please.

26:10.603 --> 26:16.040
- No, no, no! -I just wanna see if
everything has adjusted on its own.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.509
Damn, they're like
little quail eggs.

26:23.249 --> 26:26.116
I've got some, uh,
rather serious MRI results.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.320
We found a brain tumor, benign,
thankfully, but quite sizable.

26:29.322 --> 26:32.856
- Jesus. -It's probably
been there for many years,

26:32.858 --> 26:35.125
pressed up against
your pituitary gland.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.628
The pressure it's applied
has caused your body

26:37.630 --> 26:39.229
to produce the female
hormone prolactin,

26:39.231 --> 26:41.365
which has blocked
your normal male development.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.168
We found just trace amounts
of testosterone.

26:44.170 --> 26:49.940
Basically, you've never
gone through puberty.

26:49.942 --> 26:54.078
- I have a brain tumor?
- Yes.

26:58.516 --> 27:02.286
That...

27:02.288 --> 27:04.121
is....

27:04.123 --> 27:07.157
Awesome.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.459
That is awesome!

27:08.461 --> 27:11.328
Okay, well, seems
you're in shock, but...

27:11.330 --> 27:13.197
See, I thought
I was a freak! I thought,

27:13.199 --> 27:14.932
you're different, but what am I?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.533
I thought,
you're some kind of anomaly,

27:16.535 --> 27:18.636
but what the fuck kind
of weirdo we talking about?

27:18.638 --> 27:20.304
And you're saying I'm normal?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.406
Yes. That would explain why
you've never physically matured,

27:22.408 --> 27:25.175
- the lack of hair, the boy balls.
- The what?

27:25.177 --> 27:28.946
Sometimes the nurses coin a
phrase that sticks in your head.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.815
This is the best damn day
of my life.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.351
- So what do we do now?
- Well, given its placement,

27:34.353 --> 27:36.654
I think we can remove it
fairly easily through your nose.

27:36.656 --> 27:41.058
You're gonna take this life-sucking,
puberty-fucking tumor

27:41.060 --> 27:42.559
out of my brain through my nose?

27:42.561 --> 27:44.795
Can we go now?

27:44.797 --> 27:48.198
<i>But why couldn't you tell your
best friends that you're a weirdo?</i>

27:48.200 --> 27:51.001
<i>- You don't have to answer that.
- Why?</i>

27:51.003 --> 27:53.604
<i>Because you just did!
You called him a weirdo!</i>

27:53.606 --> 27:57.908
No, but he has a point. Who wants to
be treated like the elephant man?

27:57.910 --> 28:00.177
<i>But, like,
you still could've told us.</i>

28:00.179 --> 28:02.780
<i>I mean, who we gonna tell?
Maybe my sisters, but they're,</i>

28:02.782 --> 28:06.250
<i>- like, in seventh grade.
- Don't tell your sisters.</i>

28:06.252 --> 28:08.085
<i>I'm really close to my sisters.</i>

28:08.087 --> 28:10.087
<i>That's okay.
But do you tell them</i>

28:10.089 --> 28:13.424
<i>- every time you masturbate?
- Not every time.</i>

28:13.426 --> 28:15.125
<i>Hang on, Pete.</i>

28:15.127 --> 28:18.128
<i>So after puberty didn't happen,
weren't you, like,</i>

28:18.130 --> 28:22.166
<i>"this is fucked up.
I'm really worried about this"?</i>

28:22.168 --> 28:24.068
Of course! Yes! I was worried
of people finding out.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.170
I was worried that people
were gonna find out

28:26.172 --> 28:27.905
I was a freakazoid
with baby balls who'd...

28:27.907 --> 28:31.275
never even had
an erection before.

28:31.277 --> 28:35.045
<i>But didn't you think a doctor
could maybe figure out...</i>

28:35.047 --> 28:37.981
No. I never told a doctor
about this. Are you crazy?

28:37.983 --> 28:40.718
<i>Right, 'cause they'd
make fun of you?</i>

28:40.720 --> 28:44.655
No, that's not it at all.

28:44.657 --> 28:47.091
I was...

28:47.093 --> 28:49.993
Scared shitless
that they'd tell me

28:49.995 --> 28:51.962
that I would be
like this forever.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.831
And all I ever wanted
was to be normal,

28:53.833 --> 28:55.899
and I couldn't let a doctor
kill my hope

28:55.901 --> 28:58.001
that normal was possible.

28:58.003 --> 29:02.272
<i>Dude, that actually makes sense.
That's, like, super zen.</i>

29:02.274 --> 29:04.341
<i>I mean, this is great.
You're normal now.</i>

29:04.343 --> 29:07.044
<i>You got to tell Michelle,
play the sympathy card, right?</i>

29:07.046 --> 29:10.948
- No. <i>-I'm gonna hate
myself in the morning</i>

29:10.950 --> 29:13.183
<i>for saying this,
but that could actually be</i>

29:13.185 --> 29:15.419
<i>the greatest closing line
of all time.</i>

29:15.421 --> 29:17.755
<i>"Hey, baby,
I've never had an erection,</i>

29:17.757 --> 29:22.493
<i>and I just had elective surgery
to remove a tumor from my brain</i>

29:22.495 --> 29:24.628
<i>and I'm getting
my first erection,</i>

29:24.630 --> 29:28.432
<i>looking for the right girl
to utilize it on."</i>

29:28.434 --> 29:31.902
Neither one of you fucking say
a word to Michelle! Okay?

29:31.904 --> 29:34.238
Besides, we don't even know
what's gonna come of this.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.975
<i>Well, hopefully</i> you <i> are.</i>

29:37.977 --> 29:41.345
<i>Gonna</i> come <i> from this?</i>

29:41.347 --> 29:46.250
<i>- You know? -You mean, like...
Like ejaculating?</i>

29:46.252 --> 29:49.686
<i>Yes. C-u-m.</i>

29:49.688 --> 29:53.857
<i>It's c-o-m-e.</i>

29:53.859 --> 29:55.926
Recovery should be fairly quick.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.762
But you'll have to take
a few weeks off work.

29:58.764 --> 30:01.965
You're gonna be okay.
There's nothing to worry about.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.868
Actually, more like
champagne grapes.

30:04.870 --> 30:10.174
Yeah, they are.
Yeah.

30:10.176 --> 30:13.343
Yeah, I'm still feeling great.

30:13.345 --> 30:17.815
Hi, honey.
We're here for you.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.217
I'm sorry we let you down.

30:20.219 --> 30:23.754
We're not doctors so,
you know, how could we...?

30:23.756 --> 30:25.355
How you feeling?

30:25.357 --> 30:27.491
When rich told me that the tumor

30:27.493 --> 30:30.694
had kept you trapped inside
the body of a 7th-grader

30:30.696 --> 30:33.931
and that's why you've never
had sex or an erection,

30:33.933 --> 30:36.733
I felt so happy for you.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.736
This hospital smells so bad...

30:39.738 --> 30:43.006
But... you
smell really good.

30:43.008 --> 30:47.744
Now you'll be able to experience the
full essence of your masculinity.

30:47.746 --> 30:51.215
Yeah, right.
How about that, pal?

30:51.217 --> 30:55.619
Just... I don't know,
kind of reminds me of sex.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.187
Do you wonder
what it looks like?

30:57.189 --> 30:58.789
- Just do it.
- I'm not gonna do it.

30:58.791 --> 31:00.157
- Just do it. You're bros.
- Okay.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.259
Just pull back the covers.

31:02.261 --> 31:05.963
- Oh!
- Oh-ho... that's... sweet.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.131
That's gonna improve.

31:08.133 --> 31:11.501
Well, the surgery was a success.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.371
It may take a while before
you start noticing changes,

31:14.373 --> 31:20.477
but, uh... just
focus on your recovery.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.813
Finally gonna be a man.

31:22.815 --> 31:25.816
And good luck with that.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.889
I'm channeling
from your spirit guide.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.358
May the great goddess shakti...

31:34.360 --> 31:38.061
Inspire this blessed heart...

31:38.063 --> 31:40.631
And may the universal energy...

31:40.633 --> 31:44.368
Bring joy and life
up through the heart,

31:44.370 --> 31:47.771
out into the universe
through this human body.

31:47.773 --> 31:53.844
Thank you to our brothers
and sisters of the Pleiades.

31:53.846 --> 31:58.982
Namaste.

31:58.984 --> 32:02.452
Thank you, mom.
I really like recouping here.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.821
We all love you, honey.

32:04.823 --> 32:08.025
We all love you!

32:08.027 --> 32:11.495
Look at you!

32:46.065 --> 32:49.299
Everything alright in there?

32:49.301 --> 32:54.705
Yep.

32:54.707 --> 32:57.774
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it going, buddy?

32:57.776 --> 33:01.378
You getting wood yet?
Sorry.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.846
- We talked about this.
- Right.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.915
You said you're gonna go in,
grab his penis.

33:04.917 --> 33:07.150
I said don't do it.
You said you wouldn't.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.086
Sorry. I'm sorry.
We've just been talking

33:09.088 --> 33:10.454
about whether
you got wood or not,

33:10.456 --> 33:11.922
and I've just
been thinking about it,

33:11.924 --> 33:13.123
and I just wanted
to see if you did.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.958
I feel the same as I did before,

33:14.960 --> 33:18.395
and I'm starting to worry that the
surgery might not have worked.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.130
Of course it worked!
You were at a hospital

33:20.132 --> 33:21.965
with doctors who went to school
for this sort of thing.

33:21.967 --> 33:25.135
I can't go back to living
the way that I lived before,

33:25.137 --> 33:27.471
knowing what I know now.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.639
It's going to work,
and trust me,

33:29.641 --> 33:32.309
you are going
to love sporting wood.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.978
I do it all the time.
As much as I can. I love it.

33:34.980 --> 33:38.081
- Yeah, he tells me about it each time.
- Yeah, you know.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.017
You definitely
don't have to text me,

33:40.019 --> 33:42.252
because my wife and I,
we share a cloud.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.187
Don't talk to my wife
about your penis!

33:44.189 --> 33:47.224
Fine! I'll get you a different phone
or something so I can text you.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.059
It's not... I don't need
a burner for your penis.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.794
How about this?
How about one time,

33:50.796 --> 33:53.563
you masturbate, don't tell me,
see how that affects your life?

33:53.565 --> 33:55.932
- I'm not gonna like that.
- I have a question.

33:55.934 --> 33:59.102
If you could never actually
physically perform...

33:59.104 --> 34:02.305
- Mm-hmm.
- Like have sex with somebody.

34:02.307 --> 34:05.742
- Mm-hm. -What about that
time in high school

34:05.744 --> 34:07.577
that you told us about?

34:07.579 --> 34:10.447
Well, um, technically,
there was penetration.

34:10.449 --> 34:14.351
- Great. -But, technically,
I was not erect.

34:14.353 --> 34:17.353
So, technically, it was
the worst day of my life.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.489
How did you get it all in
there if it's not hard?

34:20.492 --> 34:23.060
She said it was like making
love to a boneless thumb.

34:23.062 --> 34:26.263
- Ah... so specific.
- And right now,

34:26.264 --> 34:29.366
I got nothing. Zero.
Nothing happening down there.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.400
Got the penis of Stephen Hawking
at the moment.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.170
I don't wanna split hairs,
but Stephen Hawking

34:33.172 --> 34:35.072
could actually get an erection.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.340
But you're trying to say
that your penis is brilliant.

34:37.342 --> 34:42.079
Alright, well,
for your Stephen Hawking,

34:42.081 --> 34:44.714
we have brought a black hole...

34:44.716 --> 34:47.984
- Well...
- That... seemed disrespectful.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.453
It's gonna be great.

34:49.455 --> 34:52.856
Come on in.
So sorry we kept you waiting.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.792
Pete, Montana
is a professional stripper.

34:55.793 --> 35:01.498
Who we've brought here
to give you a boner.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.133
I felt like that subtext
was very clear.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.268
- I got you.
- Do you get it?

35:05.270 --> 35:07.904
- Yeah.
- Cool. Very cool.

35:07.906 --> 35:12.109
So, Montana... do your thing.

35:16.582 --> 35:19.082
- Huh? Huh?

35:19.084 --> 35:22.052
Get out.

35:22.054 --> 35:24.421
- Mm-mm...
- No...

35:24.423 --> 35:28.492
- Just go.
- Um, we did pay for it...

35:28.494 --> 35:30.227
Her. Her.

35:30.229 --> 35:33.630
If one thing leads to another,
we could always pay you more.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.533
We won't tell the cops
if you guys have sex.

35:42.573 --> 35:45.876
- Shhh! Don't fucking...

35:57.989 --> 36:01.191
- I'm hard. -But don't tell me.
We just discussed this.

36:10.201 --> 36:13.570
- Wow! That's actually impressive.
- Thanks, man.

36:22.047 --> 36:26.116
- How's it going up there?
- Oh, uh, pretty good.

36:26.118 --> 36:29.452
She's a great gal. I think she's
got his best interests in mind.

36:29.454 --> 36:32.923
- Yeah, she's a hooker, Luke.
- Right.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.569
It's not you.
Let me just put it that way.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.637
I've been through an immense
amount of pressure,

36:47.639 --> 36:49.757
personal stress, since
about the age of...

36:49.782 --> 36:50.840
honey, it's okay.

36:50.842 --> 36:54.444
I've been thinking about getting
my real-estate license.

37:37.488 --> 37:42.325
Petey?
Breakfast is ready!

37:42.327 --> 37:46.196
I will eat your eggs!

37:46.198 --> 37:50.900
Hey, Carmen, can you get me
some more orange juice, please?

37:50.902 --> 37:53.536
And cut up some apples
in little tiny pieces.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.505
- Good morning.
- Good morning, hon.

37:55.507 --> 38:00.010
Hey, pal.

38:00.012 --> 38:02.646
- Oh, my god!
- Oh!

38:02.648 --> 38:05.448
- The flame has arisen!
- Touchdown!

38:05.450 --> 38:08.718
Ha-ha-ha! He could put out
an eye with that one.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.721
It's like he's got the <i> Sunday</i>
<i>times</i> rolled up in there.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.556
- Don't be embarrassed!
- Embarrassed?

38:13.558 --> 38:16.393
Be proud, young man!
Take a victory lap!

38:16.395 --> 38:20.864
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

38:20.866 --> 38:23.700
We got one!

38:23.702 --> 38:27.871
- Thanks for everything, guys!

38:27.873 --> 38:30.040
You're not stepping out that door
until you have some breakfast.

38:30.042 --> 38:32.409
- Thanks, mom, I'm really...
- Let him go, hon.

38:32.411 --> 38:36.346
It's time to get on that field
and score.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.048
- Gotta go! Gotta go!
- Call me!

38:38.050 --> 38:40.617
- Tell me what happens! Call me!
- Okay, I will!

39:09.513 --> 39:12.816
- Luke.
- Pete! What are you doing here?

39:12.818 --> 39:17.420
Or, no, it's your house. That's what
you're doing here. But like, today,

39:17.422 --> 39:19.489
I thought you were gonna
get here... tomorrow.

39:19.491 --> 39:23.760
But it's so awesome to see you.
I'm so glad you're here. C'mere.

39:23.762 --> 39:27.230
- Ah! Naked! Get off me. -I know
you said emergencies only, but...

39:27.232 --> 39:31.935
Rosalyn wanted a place to...
Have sex with me.

39:31.937 --> 39:35.905
- So we came here. -Your bed
was really comfortable.

39:35.907 --> 39:39.275
- You used my fucking bed?
- We did it everywhere.

39:39.277 --> 39:41.077
Get the fuck out. Get out.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.546
- Did I do something wrong?
- Get out. Get out.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.248
- Get out.
- Both of us?

39:45.250 --> 39:46.983
- Both of you.
- Now?

39:46.985 --> 39:49.853
- Yeah, get out. Get out.
- I guess we have to go.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.822
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Dude! Congratulations!

39:52.824 --> 39:55.425
- That's awesome! That's great!
- Fuck!

39:55.427 --> 39:56.960
Rich is gonna be so excited!

39:56.962 --> 39:58.895
Let's go.
Let's give him some privacy.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.131
He just got a boner
for the first time.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.922
I'm pretty sure I've got
carpal tunnel syndrome.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.892
- It's part of the process.
- My son is already starting.

41:35.894 --> 41:39.362
The other day, I walked in on
him, he's watching <i> Spongebob,</i>

41:39.364 --> 41:41.731
his six-year-old Wang
is in a bowl of apple sauce.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.734
- Wow. What'd you do?
- Shut the door,

41:44.736 --> 41:47.770
- gave him his privacy.
- Oh, that's what's up.

41:47.772 --> 41:50.340
You know, every moment,
it seems to be a new thought,

41:50.342 --> 41:53.476
like a new realization,
and most of them are good.

41:53.478 --> 41:57.780
Like I know for a 100% fact that I
definitely wanna be with Michelle now.

41:57.782 --> 42:00.316
But I'm freaked out.
What if she's not into me?

42:00.318 --> 42:03.987
But also what if she does like me? Now I
have something to actually do about it.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.811
Why can't I stop jerking off?

42:05.836 --> 42:09.959
Last night, I jerked it to just
the theme from <i> game of thrones.</i>

42:09.961 --> 42:12.161
I couldn't even hold out
for Khaleesi.

42:12.163 --> 42:15.999
The need to Jack off is right there
next to the need to breathe. Okay?

42:16.001 --> 42:19.302
Wanna know how much baby batter
I've shot since I was 13?

42:19.304 --> 42:23.172
- No.
- Twice per day, times...

42:23.174 --> 42:25.909
And I did the weekends,
three times more...

42:25.911 --> 42:31.080
Jesus. That's, like,
3.5 million seconds.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.016
Of course you're more successful
than I am.

42:33.018 --> 42:35.084
You've had so much more time
to get shit done.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.986
If I had
all my jerk-off time back,

42:36.988 --> 42:40.790
who knows, I could've been...
The leader of the free world

42:40.792 --> 42:44.527
instead of just...
West valley Honda.

42:44.529 --> 42:46.496
How are women
not running everything?

42:46.498 --> 42:48.631
No, trust me,
women masturbate too.

42:48.633 --> 42:52.602
No shit, murder she wrote. Is there
anything else I can get for you?

42:52.604 --> 42:56.873
- I'm Luke.
- I'm off at 5:30.

42:56.875 --> 43:00.176
- Are you a hypnotist?
- Yeah.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.949
- Pete! Hola!
- Hi.

43:05.951 --> 43:07.984
Hey, I've been dying
to talk to you.

43:07.986 --> 43:10.219
I have to go to Santa
Barbara for a week or so.

43:10.221 --> 43:13.389
I got accepted into this new program
that Bobby flay is sponsoring.

43:13.391 --> 43:15.758
And the end of it,
he's gonna select one of us

43:15.760 --> 43:19.195
to be his sous-chef at a new restaurant
that he's opening up in L.A.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.763
- Holy cow! Yes!
- I know!

43:20.765 --> 43:22.599
I can't believe I made it.

43:22.601 --> 43:25.702
I had to submit one of my dishes
and I guess they liked it enough.

43:25.704 --> 43:31.307
So this is maybe my path to becoming
a chef, and it's mostly your fault.

43:32.309 --> 43:34.010
- Come here.
- Uh-oh!

43:34.012 --> 43:37.113
Just realized I'm late and I gotta go.
I'm so sorry.

43:37.115 --> 43:39.248
I would love to hang out
with you before I leave.

43:39.250 --> 43:42.352
- Me, too. I would love that.
- Okay.

43:53.797 --> 43:59.268
Pete, welcome back!
Ooh, you moisturize. So soft.

43:59.270 --> 44:01.904
So great to have you back.

44:11.081 --> 44:15.785
You know, I'm trying to
rechannel my sexual energy,

44:15.787 --> 44:18.621
but quite frankly,
it's been very difficult,

44:18.623 --> 44:21.224
it's been a challenge for me.

44:21.226 --> 44:24.127
Well, don't beat yourself up
too much, because

44:24.129 --> 44:27.063
if change was easy,
I'd be out of work.

44:27.065 --> 44:32.301
You know, the thing is,
it's a common misconception:

44:32.303 --> 44:35.071
Being a furry is not
just about having sex.

44:35.073 --> 44:39.876
People think that, but it's more of a
lifestyle than anything else, you know?

44:49.988 --> 44:52.288
Y'know, it's about
the memories that you make,

44:52.290 --> 44:55.992
the friends that you
Cherish and it's about the...

44:55.994 --> 44:57.627
The butts that
you sniff, you know?

44:57.629 --> 44:59.896
Once you get your snout
up a couple of good ones,

44:59.898 --> 45:01.464
it's like eating potato chips:

45:01.466 --> 45:04.200
You just keep getting back
into that bag

45:04.202 --> 45:07.603
until there's nothing left,
until it's just a big greasy bag

45:07.605 --> 45:13.176
and you're licking your fingers
at the end. Did you hear that?

45:13.178 --> 45:16.779
Somebody opening up a... can?

45:16.781 --> 45:19.849
I think I understand
your frustration.

45:19.851 --> 45:25.088
Being reduced
to animal instincts.

45:25.090 --> 45:28.825
Being dominated
like a dog or a cat.

45:28.827 --> 45:32.929
Climbing into the lap
of a... of a lover.

45:32.931 --> 45:36.365
Feeling those warm loins
next to you...

45:36.367 --> 45:38.668
While she...

45:38.670 --> 45:41.037
Rubs her fingers
through your hair

45:41.039 --> 45:45.007
and you just...
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

45:45.009 --> 45:47.110
That's a huge turn-on.

45:47.112 --> 45:50.313
What the fuck
is happening here? Are you...

45:50.315 --> 45:55.118
I'm so sorry,
are you hitting on me?

45:55.120 --> 45:57.920
- My mistake.
- -Jennifer is 24,

45:57.922 --> 45:59.822
and she's a tango instructor.

45:59.824 --> 46:01.691
You know,
very limber with the body.

46:01.693 --> 46:06.429
And she has just totally
opened me up sexually, okay?

46:06.431 --> 46:09.599
So, last night, she wanted
me to do something,

46:09.601 --> 46:11.267
you know, a little different.

46:11.269 --> 46:14.370
So she said,
"could you just peg me?"

46:14.372 --> 46:16.639
I didn't even know
what the hell that meant.

46:16.641 --> 46:19.342
I mean, I'm from Connecticut,
for Godssakes.

46:19.344 --> 46:21.811
But apparently it has something
to do with a strap-on.

46:21.813 --> 46:23.479
So I put this strap-on on.

46:23.481 --> 46:26.048
It's like this
gigantic cock, you know,

46:26.050 --> 46:30.086
and she just was
having me, you know,

46:30.088 --> 46:32.421
just drill her again
and again and again.

46:32.423 --> 46:35.858
And I just realized
that I like giving

46:35.860 --> 46:37.994
so much more
than receiving, you know.

46:37.996 --> 46:42.632
Like the power of, you know, just
making a woman, like, come like that.

46:42.634 --> 46:47.537
And she is screaming. I mean, she
has an orgasm. It's like, you know,

46:47.539 --> 46:50.273
it's waking up the cat
down the street,

46:50.275 --> 46:52.508
if you know what I mean.
And she's into it, you know.

46:52.510 --> 46:57.580
Just watching her face as she comes,
like, again and again and again...

46:57.582 --> 47:01.450
Okay. That's all the time
we have today.

47:01.452 --> 47:07.456
No, I'm pretty sure we've
got about 35 minutes left.

47:23.207 --> 47:26.309
Fuck!

47:30.614 --> 47:32.481
Hey, Pete. Nikki's over.

47:32.483 --> 47:34.417
I'm experimenting with
some food. Wanna come over?

47:34.419 --> 47:36.552
Sounds good.
I'm not feeling well.

47:36.554 --> 47:42.124
What is taking so long?
I'm starving. Oh, hi, Pete.

47:42.126 --> 47:45.194
- Hi.
- -Oh, my...

47:45.196 --> 47:47.864
Hey, would you mind
if I pop those on YouTube?

47:47.866 --> 47:51.400
Uh, I think I'll have to take
a rain check on YouTube,

47:51.402 --> 47:57.373
and I had a big breakfast, so...

47:57.375 --> 48:02.011
- What is wrong with you?
- What? It's a real thing.

48:02.013 --> 48:03.746
- Keep your eyes open.
- Doc.

48:03.748 --> 48:07.717
Help! You gotta help me, okay?
I'm losing my mind.

48:07.719 --> 48:10.887
I'm horny, I'm moody,
and I think I'm going nuts.

48:10.889 --> 48:16.092
- Excuse me.
- It's fine, go ahead.

48:16.094 --> 48:18.361
I'm sorry,
did we have an appointment?

48:18.363 --> 48:21.664
No, we didn't. But you gotta help me, okay?
Because I'm losing my mind, doc.

48:21.666 --> 48:24.715
It's really all happening
way too fast for me.

48:24.740 --> 48:26.402
Look, just calm down.

48:26.404 --> 48:28.671
I'm sorry the process
is so troubling,

48:28.673 --> 48:30.706
but because it's been
delayed for 15 years,

48:30.708 --> 48:33.910
it's actually not surprising
that your puberty experience

48:33.912 --> 48:35.845
is happening at
a highly accelerated speed.

48:35.847 --> 48:38.681
- It's actually quite fascinating.
- Oh, it's fascinating? Good.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.816
I'm glad my misery
can be an upper for you, doc.

48:40.818 --> 48:44.153
- I didn't mean it that way.
- Can you just give me a pill

48:44.155 --> 48:47.456
that'll make me a normal kind of
human being going through puberty?

48:47.458 --> 48:49.892
That's all I need from you.
That's why I'm here.

48:49.894 --> 48:55.431
If I could create a pill that cured
puberty, I could buy France.

48:59.137 --> 49:04.073
- Hey. Got a minute?
- Yes. Come on in, please, yes.

49:04.075 --> 49:08.644
I'm sorry about Nikki. Your face
looks a lot better, though.

49:08.646 --> 49:11.414
Yeah. You know those guys
at proactiv, that Adam Levine,

49:11.416 --> 49:14.016
they just know what
they're doing. Have a seat.

49:14.018 --> 49:16.886
Oh, thanks. I actually can't
stay long. I have to pack.

49:16.888 --> 49:20.323
I'm leaving for that cooking
retreat thing I told you about.

49:20.325 --> 49:23.726
I'm leaving tomorrow, so I
just wanted to come say goodbye.

49:23.728 --> 49:26.829
Oh. Well, goodbye.

49:26.831 --> 49:28.831
Are you okay?

49:28.833 --> 49:35.037
Yeah. No. Why?
Do I seem like I'm not okay?

49:35.039 --> 49:36.973
Ever since you came back
from that family thing,

49:36.975 --> 49:39.375
it just seems like
you've been avoiding me.

49:39.377 --> 49:42.645
Or... I don't know,
you just seem different.

49:46.083 --> 49:49.318
It's just, uh...
Look, if...

49:49.320 --> 49:54.290
When you come back...
We'll have a lot to talk about.

49:54.292 --> 49:57.326
- Good.
- I'll be ready by then.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.829
To talk.
About whatever, yeah.

49:59.831 --> 50:02.198
- Well...
- Let me walk you out!

50:02.200 --> 50:07.003
- Oh, it's okay. Okay, bye.
- Okay. Bye. Oh...

50:07.005 --> 50:11.173
- Okay.
- Bye.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.447
Okay, yeah.

50:21.019 --> 50:23.285
Hey, Michelle.

50:23.287 --> 50:26.088
<i>- Pete, hey.</i>
- Wow, you look great.

50:26.090 --> 50:28.057
How was your first day?

50:28.059 --> 50:31.494
- Dude, I'm getting raped here.
- Shut the fuck up. Don't say raped.

50:31.496 --> 50:34.063
He's not getting raped.
We're just playing a video game.

50:34.065 --> 50:35.631
<i>- Oh, yeah, yeah, that's cool.</i>
- Hey, what's up, Michelle?

50:35.633 --> 50:38.200
<i>Hey, Josh.
Pete, oh, my gosh.</i>

50:38.202 --> 50:43.272
<i>Things are going so, so great here. Bobby
is incredible. I'm learning so much.</i>

50:43.274 --> 50:45.641
Oh, that's great.
So it's "Bobby" now?

50:45.643 --> 50:48.377
<i>Well, he insisted
that we call him Bobby.</i>

50:48.379 --> 50:50.046
<i>He's very down-to-earth.</i>

50:50.048 --> 50:53.315
<i>And totally normal,
not to mention very handsome.</i>

50:53.317 --> 50:57.553
<i>- I heard that!
- I got busted.</i>

50:57.555 --> 51:01.157
So... you're at his house
right now, just you?

51:01.159 --> 51:05.761
<i>There's a few of us here,
but it's not like... like that.</i>

51:05.763 --> 51:08.030
- Are you drunk?
- <i>-She's not sober!</i>

51:08.032 --> 51:12.468
<i>Quiet! I'm actually teacher's
pet, which is quite nice.</i>

51:12.470 --> 51:15.704
<i>But he's very hands-on
with all the contestants.</i>

51:15.706 --> 51:18.374
- Oh, I bet. -Okay, well, I'm
kind of in the middle of a game.

51:18.376 --> 51:20.776
I'm glad you're having fun.
That's fantastic.

51:20.778 --> 51:23.212
But I promise to call you
tomorrow, okay?

51:23.214 --> 51:25.981
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Alright. Bye.

51:25.983 --> 51:27.883
Sorry, dude.

51:27.885 --> 51:30.820
I cannot believe that she's chillin'
with master flay like that.

51:30.822 --> 51:34.990
What do you mean?
She's getting extra chef time.

51:34.992 --> 51:37.560
That's good for her.
It's what she wants to do.

51:37.562 --> 51:40.729
Easy does it,
Dr. j for "jealous."

51:40.731 --> 51:42.832
I'm not jealous.

51:45.403 --> 51:47.837
You're listening
to metropolitan public radio.

51:47.839 --> 51:51.340
And this is a safe place.
I'm Noema Willcoxen.

51:51.342 --> 51:54.276
My guest today
is Dr. Peter Newmans,

51:54.278 --> 51:56.579
sexual-addiction
therapist and author

51:56.581 --> 52:00.182
of <i> from sex to success,</i>
a book specializing

52:00.184 --> 52:02.551
in the rechanneling
of sexual energy.

52:02.553 --> 52:05.154
- Welcome, Dr. Newmans.
- Thank you so much, Noema.

52:05.156 --> 52:09.458
I just have to say, I'm a huge
fan. And please call me Pete.

52:09.460 --> 52:12.595
It's good to have you on,
Pete. I read your book,

52:12.597 --> 52:15.998
and I was fascinated
by some of your findings.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.802
First, tell us about
the Genesis of your book.

52:19.804 --> 52:22.605
Well, first of all,
I'd like to acknowledge

52:22.607 --> 52:26.475
the time-consuming aspect
that sex plays in all our lives.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.844
We see it in movies,
we see it in billboards,

52:28.846 --> 52:33.182
we even hear it on the
radio! Ahem.

52:33.184 --> 52:34.650
I wanted to draw attention

52:34.652 --> 52:36.785
to the vast,
mostly wasted potential

52:36.787 --> 52:39.488
and everyone who allows sex
to control...

52:39.490 --> 52:42.558
Their lives!
Ahem. Ahem!

52:42.560 --> 52:45.227
- Sorry about that.
- Why don't have some water?

52:45.229 --> 52:47.163
Thank you.

52:47.165 --> 52:52.902
- Have a little more. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

52:52.904 --> 52:55.237
The book shows that...

52:55.239 --> 52:58.407
The pursuit of constant
sexual gratification

52:58.409 --> 53:03.779
creates neglect for more important
things like family, career goals...

53:03.781 --> 53:07.516
personal well-being.
Ahem-hem-hem.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.318
Do you think you'll
be okay to continue?

53:09.320 --> 53:13.856
- I think I'm fine. I'm great.
- Alright.

53:13.858 --> 53:16.659
You know, in reading your book,
I couldn't help wondering

53:16.661 --> 53:19.495
about the basis
of your discovery.

53:19.497 --> 53:23.933
If it started with your journey
to remove sex from your life,

53:23.935 --> 53:26.368
as you're suggesting others do.

53:26.370 --> 53:28.938
Well, the book's not about me.

53:28.940 --> 53:31.807
It's about people
who put their lives aside

53:31.809 --> 53:35.644
in pursuit of their next orgasm.

53:35.646 --> 53:38.080
Orgasm. Orgasm!

53:38.082 --> 53:41.517
Ahem.

53:41.519 --> 53:44.920
So your voice cracked
a little bit. Not a big deal.

53:44.922 --> 53:49.091
That's just one of the changes
you're going through right now.

53:49.093 --> 53:54.029
It's only natural to feel
self-conscious or insecure

53:54.031 --> 53:58.801
about your voice or skin or...

53:58.803 --> 54:01.937
- genitals.
- I know what puberty is.

54:01.939 --> 54:04.406
Okay.
Let's watch the tone, huh?

54:04.408 --> 54:07.610
No, no, it's okay.
You can act out, baby.

54:07.612 --> 54:11.747
I'm not a baby.
I'm a full-grown man!

54:11.749 --> 54:14.583
Yes, of course,
you recently are.

54:14.585 --> 54:16.752
We're just trying
to relate here.

54:16.754 --> 54:19.521
You're trying to relate to me?
Really? Thank you for that.

54:19.523 --> 54:21.991
How could you possibly
relate to me?!

54:21.993 --> 54:23.826
Hey, don't talk
to your mother like that.

54:23.828 --> 54:27.429
You don't get it!
You'll never get it!

54:27.431 --> 54:29.820
You're like from another
planet or something!

54:29.845 --> 54:32.025
I hate you! I wish I
was never even born!

54:34.571 --> 54:38.007
I've been waiting 15 years
for him to do that.

54:59.297 --> 55:01.030
Uh...

55:06.036 --> 55:07.603
Hey, Michelle!

55:07.605 --> 55:10.439
<i>Pete, hey.
Did I catch you at a bad time?</i>

55:10.441 --> 55:12.941
No, no, not at all.
It's a great time.

55:12.943 --> 55:15.444
<i>- Oh, gosh, what a day we had.</i>
- We?

55:15.446 --> 55:17.446
<i>Well, there's only
seven of us left.</i>

55:17.448 --> 55:20.115
<i>And this competition
is... fierce.</i>

55:20.117 --> 55:23.719
Oh, you made it to the finals. Wow,
congratulations, that's awesome.

55:23.721 --> 55:26.822
<i>Bobby's inside cooking us
a little late-night snack,</i>

55:26.824 --> 55:30.326
<i>and so I thought I would
come out and see how you are.</i>

55:30.328 --> 55:32.061
So it's you and the sexy chef.

55:32.063 --> 55:35.030
<i>Are you okay?
You sound a little... odd.</i>

55:35.032 --> 55:38.400
No, I'm fine, I'm great.
I... love the update.

55:38.402 --> 55:40.936
<i>- -Alright, guys,
dinner's up.</i>

55:40.938 --> 55:44.106
<i>That's the dinner bell. I gotta go, but
I'll try you back if you want me to.</i>

55:44.108 --> 55:46.909
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Try me later, that's fine.

55:46.911 --> 55:48.877
Actually, don't try me later.
Enjoy the wine.

55:48.879 --> 55:54.083
- Enjoy his dick. Boner appetite.
<i>- What?</i>

55:54.085 --> 55:57.586
- Obsessed with that thing much?
- Yeah, I am. It's a new app.

55:57.588 --> 56:00.222
A whole new world.
This one...

56:00.224 --> 56:02.324
Look, it's couples
seeking a third party.

56:02.326 --> 56:03.892
So that'd be me.
Like a threesome?

56:03.894 --> 56:06.395
Okay. Cool. Just concerned
with their well-being, are you?

56:06.397 --> 56:08.297
No, I just wanna
have a threesome.

56:08.299 --> 56:10.532
I need you to babysit
on the 22nd.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.067
What about your neighbor?

56:12.069 --> 56:13.736
What about the one
that's so nice,

56:13.738 --> 56:15.704
the bubbly "I love her so much"?

56:15.706 --> 56:17.873
She drank all our whiskey,
filled the bottles with ice tea.

56:17.875 --> 56:20.509
- What about Luke? -Why are
all these couples so oblong?

56:20.511 --> 56:22.945
- Duly noted.
- Come on, man.

56:22.947 --> 56:24.947
It's our anniversary.
Crazy sex shit in a hotel room.

56:24.949 --> 56:27.015
I can't do this
around the house.

56:27.017 --> 56:29.218
The kids are gonna smell it.
When we're done with that room,

56:29.220 --> 56:32.921
they're gonna have to light some Sage
and use it to set the room on fire.

56:32.923 --> 56:35.090
Okay, I'll babysit!
I don't wanna know.

56:35.092 --> 56:38.494
Great. Fix the resolution.

56:38.496 --> 56:39.628
- Oh.
- See? Normal.

56:39.630 --> 56:41.730
- Like me.
- Yeah!

56:41.732 --> 56:46.802
Hey, if you ladies are ready,
you wanna up the fucking ante?

56:46.804 --> 56:48.904
- Yeah.
- Double it?

56:48.906 --> 56:53.008
If y'all wanna give us 400
instead of two, we'll let ya.

56:53.010 --> 56:55.043
We don't wanna give you 400
instead of two.

56:55.045 --> 56:57.146
- But that's what it would be.
- Yeah, but just...

56:57.148 --> 57:00.949
- No, but we're gonna win.
- We know math.

57:00.951 --> 57:04.319
Oh, really? Okay.
Yeah, that's funny, isn't it?

57:04.321 --> 57:06.989
Let's fucking do it! You wanna
fucking play that game?!

57:06.991 --> 57:09.057
Let's go, man! I'm so down!

57:38.522 --> 57:40.155
I'll let you try
that one again, son.

57:40.157 --> 57:43.892
Come on, go for it.
You gotta get it. Oh, oh, oh!

57:43.894 --> 57:47.029
- Oh!

57:47.031 --> 57:48.831
You don't want it
bad enough, man.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.799
I'll give it back to you.
Try again.

57:50.801 --> 57:52.534
- What's your problem?
- Pass or shoot!

57:52.536 --> 57:54.136
Or maybe you wanna hit
my fucking nuts again.

57:54.138 --> 57:56.238
That was
a completely legal play...

57:56.240 --> 57:58.240
- Shut the fuck up and shoot.
- I'm sorry,

57:58.242 --> 58:00.442
- what the hell are you doing?
- He's playing like a man!

58:00.444 --> 58:02.878
- Fine, then let's play, then.
- Yeah, but is he okay?

58:02.880 --> 58:05.113
I will skin your fucking
face off and wear it as a hat.

58:05.115 --> 58:08.183
- Take a shot. Let's play.
- That's a little aggressive.

58:08.185 --> 58:11.520
Let's chill out a little bit, buddy.
Take a couple of deep breaths.

58:11.522 --> 58:13.288
The big guy's
about to kill himself.

58:13.290 --> 58:15.290
- I'm not gonna kill myself.
- I'm sorry, is he juicing?

58:15.292 --> 58:17.493
- It's fine.
- Fuck this. I gotta go to work.

58:17.495 --> 58:20.596
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Applebee's, I'll see you?

58:20.598 --> 58:22.130
- See you, buddy.
- Have fun. Have a real...

58:22.132 --> 58:24.099
- Alright. Bye, guys.
- That's a victory for us.

58:24.101 --> 58:28.971
Why are you jacking them off
into your own mouth?

58:28.973 --> 58:31.240
- Oh, hey, man.
- What's up?

58:31.242 --> 58:36.211
Oh, god! Dude, you smell
like an ass taco. Jesus.

58:36.213 --> 58:38.046
Try the arctic force.

58:38.048 --> 58:41.617
It's mint. It's nice.
I'll try it.

58:41.619 --> 58:46.488
- How's Becky doing? -Officially with
Brendan, but she keeps texting me,

58:46.490 --> 58:48.790
so I don't know, you know?

58:48.792 --> 58:50.392
I wanna jump in front
of a bus, basically.

58:50.394 --> 58:55.531
I'm sorry, dude.
Girls, you know? They just...

58:55.533 --> 58:59.635
You try to be the nice guy, then
all these things get in the way,

58:59.637 --> 59:03.672
like hormones and testosterone,
mood swings...

59:03.674 --> 59:05.307
- Boners.
- Boners, yeah.

59:05.309 --> 59:07.843
I got one in class
right before the bell rang.

59:07.845 --> 59:09.578
I had to stick it
in my waistband.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.547
- Sweet move.
- The tip poked out,

59:11.549 --> 59:13.982
- and everyone saw.
- Oh, that's harsh.

59:13.984 --> 59:16.184
I just acted confident,
like I did it on purpose,

59:16.186 --> 59:19.254
and everyone started applauding,
which was unexpected.

59:19.256 --> 59:23.992
The rogue boner.
He's a heartless bastard.

59:28.298 --> 59:31.033
I wish I hated Becky Addams. I
wanna ask her to the spring fling,

59:31.035 --> 59:35.237
but I don't know how to exactly,
without sounding like an ass.

59:35.239 --> 59:37.839
School dances are designed
to make 10 popular people

59:37.841 --> 59:39.608
feel really good
about themselves and happy,

59:39.610 --> 59:41.376
and the rest
are scarred for life.

59:41.378 --> 59:43.245
Everybody's got
their Becky Addams. Trust me.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.880
Is yours Michelle?

59:44.882 --> 59:47.716
No, mine's not Michelle!

59:47.718 --> 59:49.284
I am gonna ask her out
whenever she gets back.

59:49.286 --> 59:51.587
That is, if Bobby
hasn't filleted her vagina

59:51.589 --> 59:53.889
and put it on a fucking plate.
It's not funny, man.

59:53.891 --> 59:55.991
I have these possessive urges,
I can't control them.

59:55.993 --> 59:58.226
They're not based
in any form of logic,

59:58.228 --> 59:59.761
and it's confusing
the shit outta me!

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.597
Why does it have to suck
so much?

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:03.999
- Like an anvil on your chest.
- You can't sleep, can't eat.

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:05.867
The more uptight you get,
the more pimples you get

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:07.936
on your head and back
and all this shit.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.705
You're like the
only adult who gets it.

01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:13.075
I don't know how you don't
know what to do with women.

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:15.143
- I haven't dated much.
- Dude, why not?

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:16.712
You have money,
an apartment, a car.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.246
If I was you, I'd be killing it.

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:20.349
Everyone your age
has already been laid a ton,

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:22.117
so Michelle's probably already
been with tons of dudes.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:24.252
No, she hasn't.
She's been with Charlie and...

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:27.155
I'll count. I guesstimate
she popped in high school.

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:29.758
That's one, maybe two or
three boyfriends in college.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.360
That's four.
A few drunken one-nighters.

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:33.128
She's classy,
let's just say two.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.530
So that's six.
But then there's post-college,

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:40.268
and that's when a girl's gotta find her
way, right? So... it's 10 minimum.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.405
- Ten?
- Plus Charlie, so that's 11.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:45.774
Every girl Michelle's age
knows their way around a dick,

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:50.245
so my advice is to get into some
serious R&D before she comes back.

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:55.250
Show her you know what to do
with the puss.

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:58.687
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:28.350
- Oh, shit.
- Ow!

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:29.918
- Oh.
- Ow! Ow!

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.521
- My... my watch is...
- Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:48.403
- No, no! Wrong hole.
- Oh, sorry.

01:02:10.694 --> 01:02:12.761
And so you keep having sex...

01:02:12.763 --> 01:02:15.731
Over and over and over
and over again,

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:17.899
because you're scared
if you say no,

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:20.502
you might not experience enough.

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:22.471
So size, shape,

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:24.406
nationality, religion,
it doesn't matter.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.842
You just bang anybody
who's willing.

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:30.812
But then your balls
start to itch...

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:33.782
and you're not sure
if you caught something

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:38.854
or if it's your psychosomatic
paranoia kicking in again.

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.789
You understand me so well.

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:46.294
I don't have balls or anything,
but the rest of it is dead-on.

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:49.231
Mm, yeah, that's interesting.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.935
She's still out of town. I don't
know when she'll be back.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:56.638
- Oh, yeah? You talk to her?
- Yep.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.940
- She say anything about me?
- I stay out of her business.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:03.211
Oh, come on, Phil.
I know you guys are besties.

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:07.048
I messed up. I haven't been...
Putting her first.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.851
But I miss her, I really do.

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:12.254
I mean, you know
how great she is, right?

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:16.458
I just... I just
wanna make things right.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.827
Hey, if you see her,
will you just let her know

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:20.762
that I stopped by
and I dropped off these flowers?

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:23.965
- Yeah, I'll do that for you.
- I appreciate that.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:26.568
- No worries.
- Alright.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.537
Pete!

01:03:28.539 --> 01:03:33.742
I just remembered your name
is Pete. I'm such an ass.

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:38.046
No, you're not, man.

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:43.218
- Just not right for her.
- Sorry, what was that?

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.587
I said, "just not
the right key in the door."

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:47.856
Yeah.

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:13.548
- Hey. Did you give me flowers?
- Hey.

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:18.954
I just saw them, but you
didn't sign the card, silly.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.922
Welcome home.

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:23.225
Thanks. You wanna come over?

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:28.897
- I can put them in some water.
- Yeah.

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:31.066
There's something
different about you.

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:33.468
I don't know,
maybe it's your hair,

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.370
it's longer or something,
I don't know.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:38.740
But you look good.
It's good to see you.

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:43.778
It's good to see you, too.
You look good, too.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.413
Thanks.

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:49.184
I wanted to ask you something.

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:50.218
Uh...

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:55.957
- Yes?
- Maybe...

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:58.860
you wanted to tell me
about Santa Barbara,

01:04:58.862 --> 01:05:04.666
and maybe you wanted to tell me
about Santa Barbara over dinner?

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:08.503
Dinner?
Yeah, I could do that.

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:10.438
Give me an hour and I'll
tell you more about it.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.408
- So I'll see you in an hour.
- Yeah.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:17.112
Cool. Alright.

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:28.256
Oh, my god...

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.191
Rich. What's up, man?

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:33.061
- Where the fuck are you? <i>-You are
not gonna fucking believe it.</i>

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:34.729
Guess who has a date
with Michelle.

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.365
No! You're babysitting for me,
remember?

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:41.369
- Anniversary? Weird hotel sex?
- Oh, shit, dude!

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:43.605
The 22nd.
I fucking forgot, man!

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:46.074
You need to be on your way
right now.

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:47.509
<i>Well, I can't do that, rich.</i>

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:49.544
Michelle asked me to dinner.
Sorry, man.

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.346
Do it another night, okay?
I've had reservations

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:53.281
at Monte Grappa
and a suite for a month.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.183
And the things we're gonna do
in that suite,

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:57.452
<i>we're gonna fucking
wreck furniture,</i>

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.888
we're gonna lose
our security deposit for sure.

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:02.490
- What the hell! Is he close?
- Yeah.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:05.560
Well, he better be,
because I am done being mommy!

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:07.495
I should be choking on a bar
of hotel soap right now.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.464
Because I've been a bad girl,
haven't I?

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.666
You gotta discipline me,
don't you, okay?

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:14.703
You discipline me, not them,
those fucking monsters!

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:17.005
Get the Vaseline and the
cotton balls and the zip ties.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:20.675
Oh, and you better have changed the
fucking light bulb in the closet.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:23.979
I swear on my children's lives
if you're not here,

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:25.880
I'm gonna rip out
your brand-new Adam's apple

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:28.550
<i>and I'm gonna use it
as a fucking sex toy!</i>

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:31.419
You know what we're gonna do
in that hotel room? Butt stuff.

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:34.255
I didn't wanna tell you,
but you have forced my hand.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:36.057
Are you kidding me, rich?
Really?

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:38.460
I've been waiting my whole
fucking life for this moment!

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.895
Things change
when you have children, okay?

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:42.597
You're the one who chose
to have kids.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:44.766
<i>- Right?</i>
- Yes, and I love them.

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:46.568
But right now, I'm not a father,

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:49.170
I'm just a guy who wants
to violate their mother.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:53.274
You know what, rich? I wanna do
something for myself for once!

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:55.176
Okay, great.
Good for you, buddy.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.878
Do it another night.
Tonight's my anniversary.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.980
Well, you can move
your anniversary, alright?!

01:06:58.982 --> 01:07:00.348
Anniversaries are moveable.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.150
This is my one fucking
shot at Michelle!

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:05.086
You do not understand
how anniversaries work.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:08.390
It's a specific date.
That's why I fucking asked you.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:11.893
- You're a prick, rich.
- You're an asshole.

01:07:11.895 --> 01:07:14.329
You're a prick!

01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:17.065
- Shithead!
- What's a shiphead?

01:07:17.067 --> 01:07:21.236
Your uncle Pete.

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:24.172
And it's "shithead."

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:28.576
Josh, tell me, am I crazy?
How was I being selfish?

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.578
You weren't. Hos before bros.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.815
You're exactly right.
Hos before bros.

01:07:33.817 --> 01:07:37.018
There we go. How do I look?

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.720
Outfit's fleek, shoes are weak.

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:40.422
More importantly,

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:43.324
girls like some edge,
so do not be a nice guy.

01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:45.393
Well, nice is
the only tune I know.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:48.329
You cannot be nice, okay?

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:52.467
Be a dick.
Be a dick. Gotcha.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.604
Be a dick.

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.459
How did you get us a table here?

01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:20.127
Chill, sexy on the half shell,
I got this.

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:24.566
Well, it's great. And I hear the food
here is amazing, and I am hungry.

01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:27.435
That's good news for me,
because I like a girl

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:31.072
with a little meat on her bones,
if you know what I mean.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:33.308
- Yeah.
- No, no, whoa, Bromo, whoa.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.443
What are you doing?
We did not order this.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.312
It's a welcome
the chef offers everyone.

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:39.314
It's lovely.
Thank you very much.

01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:42.750
- You want this? It can stay.
- Yeah.

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:45.185
Have some.

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:54.796
Thank you.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:59.067
It was just really great
to get away and clear my head.

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:02.837
You know, you ever have those
moments when you open your eyes

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:05.473
and you just realize
your whole world has changed?

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.309
- You have no idea.
- Like, last night,

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.478
I was up late
drinking with Bobby.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.648
You would love it.
He has this old villa from 1908

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.317
and this amazing cellar
with these wines...

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:17.618
Alcoholic much?

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:20.787
And we were out on this veranda,

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.457
and we were looking up
at a million stars...

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:25.593
Okay, we get it.
You had a good time with Bobby.

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.261
Are you jealous?

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.898
No, I'm not jealous. How could I be?
I'm just concerned.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:33.902
If I slept with him, do you think I
would be telling you this story?

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:36.871
Hey, you're single.
Say you didn't sleep with him,

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:39.207
you didn't sleep with him.
Or...?

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:42.710
Why are you being
such an asshole?

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.950
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:51.219
I...

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.089
Am just really,
really nervous, actually.

01:09:55.091 --> 01:10:00.228
Because I've been wanting to go on this
date with you longer than I even knew.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:05.233
You don't have to be nervous.
You're Pete.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.634
You're my Pete.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:11.239
And I don't want you
to be anything else.

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:14.142
That's such good news.

01:10:14.144 --> 01:10:15.543
Can I start over?

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:18.379
- Please.
- I have so much to tell you.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.248
I've had an interesting ride.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:24.219
I'm... I'm still the
same person that you knew.

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:29.724
I'm still... Kinda silly, a goof.
I still love your food.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:32.994
I'm still genuine,
kinda weird, truthful,

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:37.198
- honest...
- Un-fucking-believable!

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.733
You stole our table.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:41.936
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:45.106
- Wait, Pete. What?
- I can explain what happened.

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:48.610
What happened is, he broke a
promise to his best friend,

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:49.944
and then stole our reservation.

01:10:49.946 --> 01:10:52.347
I can't believe
you stole our table.

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:54.649
You didn't have a babysitter!

01:10:54.651 --> 01:11:00.421
Luke canceled a three-way!

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:02.457
Like a real friend would.

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:05.793
- This is my soup.
- Don't you touch my soup!

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:08.429
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, there's wine for me.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:11.332
Mm. So good, honey.
You gotta try this.

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:13.134
Alright, let's do it!

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:16.504
I'm gonna beat your ass, man!
Put 'em up! Let's go!

01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:18.673
I have a boner,
I can use it to fuck or fight.

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:21.943
- Punch him with your keys!
- Yeah, you better go.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:25.213
I'm gonna use my boner
to fuck you!

01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:29.651
Ooh. Oh.

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:32.754
Michelle!
Let me give you a ride home.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:34.722
- We're going to the same place.
- I already called a cab.

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:37.725
- It's on its way.
- Can you cancel it?

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:39.994
That went completely opposite of
what I planned for this evening.

01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:44.332
- As did you. -You don't know what
I've been going through lately.

01:11:44.334 --> 01:11:45.900
Explain it to me, then.
Explain, please,

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:48.436
because I have no idea
who the hell you are right now.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:50.338
Some crazy shit
has been happening to me.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.140
You're just gonna have to give
me another chance to tell you...

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:55.276
Another chance? Well,
now you just sound like Charlie.

01:11:55.278 --> 01:11:58.813
And, oh, speaking of Charlie,
I got a text message earlier,

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:03.685
and supposedly he stopped by
and those flowers were from him?

01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:06.688
He did stop by and they
were from him.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:08.423
- I didn't think that you...
- You know what?

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:13.094
Stop. Just please stop.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:14.562
You know what? Fuck it.

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:16.698
You know what?
Go back to Charlie!

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.568
I don't give a shit anymore!

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.136
I'm not gonna apologize

01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:24.605
because I enjoy
having a cock in my mouth.

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:26.574
My friends
don't seem to like it,

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:29.243
but I think it feels good
in there.

01:12:29.245 --> 01:12:31.479
Maybe it's
an oral fixation, but...

01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:34.682
I know I love it in my mouth,

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.384
against my face and...

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:39.287
To have his hard cock
against my lips.

01:12:39.289 --> 01:12:41.489
So stop talking.

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:44.959
Pardon the interruption,
but do you drive a silver Prius?

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:47.195
- I'm in session!
- My office, now!

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:51.733
- We have 25 minutes.
- I'm having you towed.

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:53.601
You are our best and brightest.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:55.603
How could you allow
a patient to fellate you?!

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:57.405
She hadn't yet.

01:12:57.407 --> 01:13:00.141
If news of this gets out, our
clinic could be gone overnight!

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:04.145
With this Ned talk coming up,
what were you thinking?

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:07.749
I've been going through a...

01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:10.985
absurd amount
of personal issues.

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:13.988
That doesn't explain what I saw.
So go home, doctor.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:18.159
Can I call you to discuss
the talk, or just to...

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:20.862
Well, why don't we put
a pin in that,

01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:25.032
until we see if your patient
files a lawsuit, huh?

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.944
Hey.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:24.158
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:37.839
Cheers.

01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:40.741
So how's puberty at 30 going?

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:44.378
Not good.
I don't know what to do with it.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.647
I can't control it.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:50.585
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:54.455
Most guys can't.

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:57.525
Those feelings and urges...

01:14:57.527 --> 01:15:00.561
Start in puberty and...

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:04.866
Never really goes away.
It's in our DNA.

01:15:04.868 --> 01:15:07.935
That's why we screw up so much.

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:17.578
You remember the spring
when you were in 5th grade,

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:20.214
I was away in Miami on business
for a month?

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:25.019
- Yeah. -I was really at a
motel by the Burbank airport,

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:29.457
'cause your mom kicked me out.

01:15:29.459 --> 01:15:31.459
With good reason.

01:15:31.461 --> 01:15:34.262
Such a cliché, you know?

01:15:34.264 --> 01:15:40.301
Office party,
had a few drinks and, uh...

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:46.007
I... strayed.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:48.643
Once.

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:49.977
But turns out,

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:54.649
it's how we repair
our mistakes...

01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:58.586
that defines us...
In their eyes.

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:02.056
I think...

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:06.928
the biggest change
we go through...

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:11.499
is discovering the difference
between acting like a man...

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:13.968
And being a man.

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:23.210
Do I, uh...

01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:28.149
Do I embarrass you, dad?

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:33.254
No.

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:36.824
No, never.

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:39.827
All those years,
I knew something was off,

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:41.796
but you're my son...

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:45.600
And I love you...

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:50.371
no matter what.

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:52.273
That's in the DNA, too.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:54.408
Yeah.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:03.317
What am I gonna do
about this Ned talk tomorrow?

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:06.587
I guess my advice would be
to just look this Ned fella

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:09.123
square in the eye
and tell him the truth.

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.565
<i>Sex.</i>

01:17:17.567 --> 01:17:19.233
<i>Everybody's doing it.</i>

01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:21.669
<i>As a people, first we experience</i>

01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:24.538
<i>an attraction,
and then, at some point,</i>

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.875
<i>we need to get busy.</i>

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:31.646
We average one sexual thought
every seven seconds.

01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:33.748
We've got 365 day a year.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:37.218
Well, guess what,
54 of those days are gone

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.654
to nothing else
but thinking about sex.

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:43.557
Almost two months combined.
Doing absolutely nothing.

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:48.829
Isn't this amazing? Long time in the
making. It's a big moment for us.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.265
I just open and close
the curtain.

01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:54.602
What I believe is that
the only way to combat this

01:17:54.604 --> 01:17:59.006
is the rechanneling
of unnecessary sexual energy.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:01.809
One of the most important things
to keep in mind

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:04.745
is that sexual energy can be...

01:18:04.747 --> 01:18:09.383
Altered and diverted.

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:14.722
Sexual energy can be altered
and diverted.

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:29.070
I'm sorry.

01:18:29.072 --> 01:18:32.339
I had a great talk
with my dad last night.

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:34.608
That and, uh...

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.545
Recent events in my life,
which we don't have time for,

01:18:37.547 --> 01:18:42.349
have led me to say...
What I'm about to say to you.

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:45.619
It seems that...

01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:47.221
there are flaws...

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:50.558
In the theories
that I've written.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.527
- What is he doing?
- I understand the murmur.

01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:57.598
I spent the last 15 years
of my life not having sex.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.100
Avoiding it.

01:18:59.102 --> 01:19:02.403
And I've done a ton of cool shit
in my life.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:04.605
But while not having sex,

01:19:04.607 --> 01:19:08.409
I've also missed out on some
cool-ass live shit like sex.

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:11.812
And I have to say,
I've been, uh...

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:16.917
- I've been sampling it lately.
- Uh, clinical trials, as we say.

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:19.487
Why are they laughing?
That's not funny.

01:19:19.489 --> 01:19:22.757
As a doctor, I can tell you
it's fucking ridonculous!

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:27.061
And masturbation? Are you kidding me?!
Actually, you know what? Show of hands.

01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:29.029
Who here polished the dolphin
last night, huh?

01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:31.465
There it goes.
Okay. I know one of you...

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:35.236
There's not just one of you. There we go!
There's another one!

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:37.238
That's cool!
Sex is fucking awesome.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.373
It's nasty, it's disgusting,
it's weird,

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.809
and that's only
if you're doing it right.

01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:43.210
That's what sex is.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:46.013
And it's also two people
coming together.

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:50.651
And it's, uh... terrifying.

01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:52.887
And it's beautiful.

01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:57.124
And I've been missing that.
And I missed that in my book.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:20:00.094
So what am I saying here?

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:02.830
Well, I know what I'm saying.

01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:04.498
Fuck away.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.101
Fuck away!

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:09.103
Fuck away, fuck away, fuck away.

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:11.906
Fuck to your heart's desire, fuck
until your heart's covered in come,

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:14.341
I don't give a shit what you do.
Lick some ass, suck some dicks,

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:16.177
squeeze some titties,
pinch some nipples.

01:20:16.179 --> 01:20:18.445
As long as it's mutually
beneficial to the other person

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:20.714
you're doing it with,
you got my vote.

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:24.718
We got one shot at this,
one shot.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.153
And there's absolutely no way

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.089
to do that one shot right
without sex.

01:20:29.091 --> 01:20:33.928
- That's all I got to say.

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:39.900
That was for effect, right?

01:20:39.902 --> 01:20:42.403
I mean,
you're going back out there...

01:20:42.405 --> 01:20:44.238
Have sex, Caroline.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.506
And repeat.

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:49.944
After sex, I'd rinse
first and then repeat.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:13.367
- Oh.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.903
Delaney?

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:18.372
Uncle shithead!

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.574
Here's your birthday present!

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:30.150
I was wrong.

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:33.387
What I did was selfish
and stupid,

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:39.360
and I'm sorry to both of you.

01:21:39.362 --> 01:21:42.596
It's fine. We know you're
going through some stuff.

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:45.366
Yeah. But if you ever do
anything like that again,

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:47.568
I'm gonna cut your dick off,
and shove it up your asshole.

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:52.172
She's not joking. She knows
her way around a dick.

01:21:52.174 --> 01:21:55.142
- And an asshole.
- Yeah.

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:58.479
- Michelle went back to Charlie?
- Yeah.

01:21:58.481 --> 01:22:02.016
And I don't blame her.
I... I suck.

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:04.685
That's too bad. You guys seemed
really good for each other.

01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:10.090
- Yeah. -I wish I had that.
I miss being with someone.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:14.028
- What about your tinder babes?
- That was fun.

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:16.163
Some people go on there
to have sex.

01:22:16.165 --> 01:22:17.865
You tried to have sex with
72 different women in a row.

01:22:17.867 --> 01:22:21.869
- Oh, my god. -I know, but
I wanna be with someone.

01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:23.804
Like you guys.
Like in a relationship.

01:22:23.806 --> 01:22:25.606
- Yeah. We get it.
- Okay.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.241
Hey, did you hear the news?

01:22:27.243 --> 01:22:29.443
Michelle won that sous-chef spot
for that Bobby flay thing.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:34.148
- Really? -And the restaurant
opens this weekend.

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:38.819
- Good for her.
- Okay, so...?

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:41.956
You should go there,
support her.

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:43.590
Apologize face-to-face,
like a man.

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:45.592
Do what you gotta do.
You might need to say

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:48.262
you're sorry all night
in a million different ways.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:51.231
I blew it with Michelle.

01:22:51.233 --> 01:22:54.368
I'd love nothing more
than to go over and see her,

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:59.640
but... I think I...
Know what being a man is now,

01:22:59.642 --> 01:23:04.611
and maybe that's doing what she
wants and not what I want.

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:09.750
And I think she wants to not see
my face for a really long time.

01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:12.219
- So are you gonna wear a disguise?
- What?

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:14.989
I have plenty of disguises.
You can come over...

01:23:14.991 --> 01:23:17.224
- Why do you have disguises?
- I dunno.

01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:22.396
How can so much and so little be
happening in that head of yours?

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:34.241
- Sorry, sorry. No more phone.
- It's okay.

01:23:34.243 --> 01:23:35.976
- Putting it away.
- It's alright.

01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:38.612
I got to sneak out and I had
a lot to do with this soup.

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:41.648
So I just wanted you to try it,
see what you think.

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:45.419
Alright. Alright. Mm.

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:52.559
- It's cold.
- It's supposed to be.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:57.197
- Then it's perfect.
- Thank you.

01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:59.900
Welcome.
What's the name, please?

01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:01.935
Sir? Sir?!

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:13.480
- It's the mix I made you.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:15.816
You really have a thing about
making scenes in restaurants.

01:24:15.818 --> 01:24:18.819
- Just hear me out.
- No! No! I'm busy!

01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:22.956
Are you too selfish to realize that this
is a very, very important night for me

01:24:22.958 --> 01:24:27.027
and that whatever you're doing, whatever
this is, this is obviously about you?

01:24:27.029 --> 01:24:29.630
No, I came here to apologize.

01:24:29.632 --> 01:24:33.600
Don't. Okay?
I've moved on.

01:24:33.602 --> 01:24:36.470
With Charlie?
That's moving backwards!

01:24:36.472 --> 01:24:40.140
- At least I know who he is.
- Hey, is there a problem here?

01:24:40.142 --> 01:24:44.611
Pete, please, just leave.

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:50.751
Yeah. Alright.

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:53.454
You are not leaving
until you tell her everything.

01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:55.022
<i>Carpe Diem,</i> Dr. Newmans.

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:59.126
Get the fuck... back in there.

01:24:59.128 --> 01:25:02.096
Right now.

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:09.870
I never went through puberty!

01:25:09.872 --> 01:25:12.873
- I thought it would be more of a
private moment. -This is good.

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:17.311
I'm 30 years old, never went
through puberty. I had a...

01:25:17.313 --> 01:25:20.314
A tumor in my pituitary gland

01:25:20.316 --> 01:25:22.983
and it stunted everything.

01:25:22.985 --> 01:25:24.685
So when they took it out,

01:25:24.687 --> 01:25:27.721
I had a lifetime of testosterone
that hit me all at once.

01:25:27.723 --> 01:25:31.892
So jerkin' it, mood swings,
acne, it just fucking hit me.

01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:34.661
Our date... our date... that...

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:39.600
That was me learning that I had
no idea how to be a man.

01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:42.336
I've always known
what you're capable of.

01:25:42.338 --> 01:25:44.571
Now that I know
what kind of man I wanna be,

01:25:44.573 --> 01:25:46.707
I'd really like it
if you'd be around

01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:49.476
when I figure out
what I'm capable of.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.912
What the fuck is going on here?!

01:25:51.914 --> 01:25:53.447
- Okay, um...
- No, no, no!

01:25:53.449 --> 01:25:55.315
Who does he think he is?
He's causing a scene.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.284
This is embarrassing.
Let me get him outta here.

01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:59.052
I'm very confused right now,

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:01.421
but this is bringing up
a bigger issue,

01:26:01.423 --> 01:26:04.391
and I think the issue is...

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:08.395
We're not supposed
to be together.

01:26:08.397 --> 01:26:12.533
You gotta know that... right?

01:26:12.535 --> 01:26:15.068
And I am starting
this whole new career

01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:18.438
and this whole new life
and I just...

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.141
I just don't see you...

01:26:21.143 --> 01:26:22.876
In that life.

01:26:22.878 --> 01:26:26.113
Wow.

01:26:26.115 --> 01:26:28.081
I, uh...

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:31.919
Wasn't expecting this tonight.

01:26:31.921 --> 01:26:35.722
Glad we could do it in public.

01:26:35.724 --> 01:26:39.226
Um... okay.

01:26:39.228 --> 01:26:42.696
If you want me to go,
yeah, I'll go.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:46.600
Yeah, I'm gonna get
the fuck outta here.

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:53.540
Enjoy that cold soup.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.676
- See ya, Chuck.
- Later, Chazz.

01:26:55.678 --> 01:26:58.912
- Get the fuck out of my...
- Oh! Oh!

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:04.618
- What the fuck happened there?
- I don't know,

01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:07.187
I kinda just came alive.
Did I scare him?

01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:09.990
- Yeah, I think you scared everybody.
- Fuck, yeah.

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:12.593
I, um, I-I'm really busy,

01:27:12.595 --> 01:27:16.029
and I have to get back to work,
but I get off at midnight,

01:27:16.031 --> 01:27:20.934
and if you wanna maybe come by and talk me
through what has been happening with you

01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:25.439
and your whole... life...

01:27:25.441 --> 01:27:29.509
then I would like that.

01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:32.746
That sounds really good.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.915
In fact, you know what?
Fuck it, I'm starving.

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:37.251
- You got a table?
- -Not a chance, pal.

01:27:37.253 --> 01:27:39.853
I couldn't get my mother a table
in this place tonight.

01:27:39.855 --> 01:27:42.889
But I'll tell you what. Kiss her
like it's your last chance

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:44.992
and maybe I'll let you order
something to go.

01:27:53.535 --> 01:27:57.271
- Yes! Whoo!
- There you go.

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:11.184
And I get so pissed off
at my parents!

01:28:11.186 --> 01:28:15.022
They're on me about everything!
School, sports, girls!

01:28:15.024 --> 01:28:17.357
- They don't get it at all!
- You know what?

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:20.927
I don't blame you. Parents stink.
They just don't get it.

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:24.164
Really? Parents have to stink
so you can pander to teenagers?

01:28:24.166 --> 01:28:28.201
No, I didn't get it. All these
years of my study of Kundalini

01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:31.004
and I didn't realize your
sex Chakra, the red Chakra,

01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:32.806
wasn't flowing
since you were a kid.

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:36.476
- But I'm okay now, mom.
- You're better than okay.

01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:38.845
Now you can have your
own little bundle of joy.

01:28:38.847 --> 01:28:41.214
So apparently
you'll also stink in the future.

01:28:41.216 --> 01:28:43.984
Oh, no, he's gonna stink. I'm gonna
be the best mother in all of history.

01:28:43.986 --> 01:28:47.521
Good to know. Alright, grandma,
let's let the man sign books.

01:28:47.523 --> 01:28:49.222
- Proud of you.
- Thank you.

01:28:49.224 --> 01:28:51.058
- See you, pal.
- Bye.

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:54.594
And what's your name,
future achiever?

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:05.839
Well, well, well, I see you have
a copy of Dr. Newmans' new book.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:08.575
You gonna to get it signed?
He's right over there, kid.

01:29:08.577 --> 01:29:11.778
I want to, but the line's too long.
I'm not sure my mom will wait.

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.613
Oh, I can get you
through that line.

01:29:13.615 --> 01:29:15.982
I go way back
with that doc over there.

01:29:15.984 --> 01:29:18.085
Yeah, I actually helped
put him on the map.

01:29:18.087 --> 01:29:20.320
In fact, I can probably say
I did put him on the map.

01:29:20.322 --> 01:29:24.057
He started out at my practice, he
was still wet behind the ears.

01:29:24.059 --> 01:29:26.760
- Not much older than you are now.
- Really?

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:32.265
I knew right away
he was a superstar.

01:29:32.267 --> 01:29:35.702
He had that... "It" quality,

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:40.040
that undefinable essence
that nobody else saw,

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:41.508
but I sure as Hyannis port did.

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:45.412
I mean, look at him over there,
my goodness.

01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:48.281
Lovely wife, baby on the way.

01:29:48.283 --> 01:29:50.417
Big, successful author.

01:29:50.419 --> 01:29:53.153
Well-paid lecturer
on the national circuit.

01:29:53.155 --> 01:29:56.390
He owes me a debt of gratitude
for where he is today.

01:29:56.392 --> 01:29:59.860
Not that I'm asking for thanks,
I'm just stating that as a fact.

01:29:59.862 --> 01:30:03.563
But if I were him,
I would thank me.

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:07.834
At least in, you know,
the foreword of the book.

01:30:07.836 --> 01:30:10.370
And if I'm being
100% truthful here,

01:30:10.372 --> 01:30:12.806
I learned a lot
of things from him.

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:19.713
I can't think of any right now.

01:30:19.715 --> 01:30:22.616
No, he doesn't
need my help anymore.

01:30:22.618 --> 01:30:25.986
Nope, he's got it all...
Figured out.

01:30:25.988 --> 01:30:29.790
With a smug smile that says:

01:30:29.792 --> 01:30:33.960
"Yeah, my shit smells
like three-dozen roses."

01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:37.164
I think I'm gonna go get
in line with the others.

01:30:37.166 --> 01:30:39.933
Yeah, me, too.
