00:47.422 --> 00:48.881
You look like shit, man.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.553
I'm all right.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.349
Keep telling yourself that.

01:16.868 --> 01:17.868
That right there?

01:17.952 --> 01:20.788
That is the best homework assignment
the city ever came up with.

01:20.872 --> 01:24.083
Yeah. Me and the kid start this weekend.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.420
That is, of course, unless Amanda botches
everything up, like she always does.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.423
I could have Monica give her a call.
They always got along pretty well.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.760
You know, Eddie, I appreciate it,
but it's best if you stay out of it.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.846
Yo, D'Mac, what's up?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.683
Yeah, I'm interested. What do you got?

01:43.019 --> 01:46.522
Haitians. Boyle Heights.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.275
Yeah, I know the place.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.862
3-B, got it.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.281
Ya yo changing hands.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.408
You really wanna mess with
this low-level shit?

01:58.493 --> 01:59.535
Yeah, let's go.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.403
- Are we good?
- All signs point to it.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.615
Which one of you gentlemen
is gonna sign for this?

02:41.536 --> 02:42.953
Nice suit.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.751
I heard there was a problem with the toilet?

02:50.086 --> 02:53.255
All right, fellas.
We got less than one hour. Let's go.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.854
Move.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.123
- Police, freeze!
- Shit!

03:29.584 --> 03:31.627
- Get him!
- On the floor, God damn it!

03:33.296 --> 03:34.463
Stop!

03:41.304 --> 03:42.304
Don't move!

03:57.445 --> 03:59.196
- You got him?
- He got away.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.199
- What?
- He got away!

04:04.494 --> 04:05.827
Shit!

04:07.747 --> 04:10.165
Not a word, Welles. Not a goddamn word!

04:10.541 --> 04:12.084
Son of a bitch!

04:36.693 --> 04:37.734
Now.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.698
What the...

04:44.242 --> 04:46.868
Chief. We got a problem with the elevators.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.749
- Get down!
- And stay down!

04:56.629 --> 04:59.381
Now that I have your attention,
get on the floor, right now!

04:59.465 --> 05:00.799
- Take it easy, take it easy.
- Everyone!

05:00.883 --> 05:02.092
- You, too, come on!
- Get down!

05:02.719 --> 05:04.219
Everything's reading "Malfunction."

05:04.387 --> 05:06.513
- The hell is this?
- I don't know.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.056
We're not here to hurt you!

05:08.182 --> 05:11.560
You stay calm, you go home for dinner,
you understand me?

05:15.231 --> 05:16.315
Don't look at me.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.410
Nobody move! And get down on the floor!

05:29.287 --> 05:30.287
Shut up!

05:32.749 --> 05:34.124
We got a naughty one here.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.085
Jesus! FedCal, the bank.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.297
All right, that's it, bad girl.
Now we get to go make a phone call.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.718
Forty-five!

05:48.056 --> 05:50.807
<i>- News 14 hotline.</i>
- Tell them there's a robbery in progress.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.518
I'm from the FedCal Bank, downtown LA.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.853
There's a robbery in progress.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.396
<i>- Are they still in the bank?</i>
- They're still...

05:56.481 --> 05:57.481
<i>Are they...</i>

05:57.565 --> 05:59.566
Come on, man, let's get out of here.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.860
Let's go!

06:02.779 --> 06:03.945
Jump!

06:04.113 --> 06:05.197
Get down!

06:11.913 --> 06:14.206
Hey, guys, a bank robbery.
We're headed downtown.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.332
Let's go, now!

06:25.218 --> 06:26.218
- I got the back!
- I'm on it!

06:26.302 --> 06:27.844
They left the bank using the stairs!

06:28.554 --> 06:29.679
All exits are covered.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.047
Look, on the roof, a guard! Land it!

07:04.465 --> 07:08.677
- We're not cleared for this.
- We're first on the scene. Land us, now.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.809
Let's go!

07:16.936 --> 07:18.228
Get the camera out.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.689
Are you okay?

07:21.607 --> 07:22.732
- No!
- Get on the ground!

07:22.942 --> 07:25.444
Get on the ground!
Get out of the chopper now!

07:25.611 --> 07:27.028
Take a seat next to your friends!

07:37.707 --> 07:40.584
What a bunch of dummies! Good boy.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.086
Nothing but glorified paparazzi!

07:51.095 --> 07:52.846
Get us out of here!

08:10.239 --> 08:12.741
<i>There goes Channel 14 going the wrong way.</i>

08:13.075 --> 08:15.160
That's why they're in last place.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.412
Come on, Rivers, you're a free man.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.581
You're out of here.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.850
Any vacant floors?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.852
Yeah, 26 is under construction.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.854
You got security cameras on that floor?

10:06.022 --> 10:07.105
Not in the construction area.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.565
Have forensics go over it.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.609
You'll pick up prints
from half the damn city.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.235
Do it anyway.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.695
- You got it.
- Okay.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.114
Went down pretty fast. We got a mixed crew.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.450
Apparently, one of the guys
had some type of an accent.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.368
- How much did they take?
- North of two million.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.661
Some of the bills might be marked.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.706
Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.328
So, they used C-4 to knock out the elevators.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.372
Residue's being sent to the lab now.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.792
Thanks. Automatic weapons,
precision timing.

11:09.752 --> 11:13.088
Shape charges.
Degree of difficulty is off the charts.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.549
They were hot shit, no doubt about that.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.344
It'll make it that much sweeter
when we take them down.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.428
Yeah.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.653
What is it you want?

11:37.363 --> 11:38.905
You Sergei?

11:39.740 --> 11:41.658
Mikhail, from in the joint, sent me.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.286
Okay.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.502
Y'all having fun, huh?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.629
Not so fast, my man.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.214
Show me ID.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.512
USA! USA! USA!

12:07.893 --> 12:08.893
Think about it.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.568
Cool down.

12:17.903 --> 12:21.990
We... We have vodka
and take care of business, huh?

12:24.952 --> 12:26.995
That's what I thought you'd say.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.914
We've got some serious stacks now.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.708
And I mean it's love, baby.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.504
- Yeah, we did all right.
- All right, my ass.

12:39.508 --> 12:42.343
Our biggest heist yet,
and you, you don't seem too jazzed.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.721
No, I'm good.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.681
I'm good.

12:48.517 --> 12:51.436
Listen, Dad called last night.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.856
He wants us to come see him.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.275
No. Hell, no, Jake.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.695
I've been to see Dad in jail.
I've been to juvie.

13:00.863 --> 13:04.199
I'm not going back. Not for you, not for Dad,

13:05.034 --> 13:07.994
- not for anybody. Ever.
- Okay, okay.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.039
He's got less than five.

13:11.373 --> 13:12.916
So, when he gets out,

13:14.543 --> 13:15.794
maybe we build him a house.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.715
- Cool?
- Cool.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.349
Gordon says you find anything marked,
burn it.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.272
Sounds tight.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.400
You just gonna leave your kid bro up there
with all that paper?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.861
If he runs out with it, shoot him.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.613
I will, too.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.449
Remember the song?

13:49.119 --> 13:50.328
A'ight.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.087
I don't know what to tell you.
We're so... We're so busy. Look at this.

13:59.338 --> 14:03.800
And if we get that empty space next door,
think about how amazing it's gonna be.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.931
- What's this?
- Open it.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.229
Oh, my God.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.613
It's beautiful.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.449
I think you're beautiful, too.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.454
If you'll have me,

14:37.960 --> 14:40.545
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.738
Cocky assholes.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.206
Tapes are ready.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.208
All right, let's see what we got.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.417
There's 20 elevators for the lobby.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.378
Twelve for the lower floors,
eight for the uppers.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.213
You can cross over at 22.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.507
So, over the course of the day,
how many people on and off?

16:07.841 --> 16:09.258
- Ten thousand, give or take.
- Shit.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.219
Well, let's see who got off
on the construction floor.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.929
It couldn't have been more
than a handful of people.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.640
Well, it doesn't work that way.
These tapes are time-coded, not floor-coded.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.016
All these people getting on and off

16:17.101 --> 16:19.769
and we have no idea
what floor we're watching?

16:19.853 --> 16:21.354
Yeah. I mean, that's how it works.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.982
Come on.
This is some system you got here, Chief.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.900
Most of the buildings in the city
are set up this way.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.111
- Whoever set it up is an idiot.
- Hey, I don't need this!

16:28.195 --> 16:29.237
All right, I'm down here trying to help.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.155
Hey. Look, man,
he doesn't mean nothing by it, all right?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.782
- Thanks for coming by, okay?
- Screw you.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.538
Meds not working
or we just need to get you laid?

16:38.622 --> 16:40.623
- What's the problem?
- Look at this.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.793
It's a camera.
They knew the elevator was empty.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.129
They knew the building.
They knew the whole system.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.048
Yeah, must be a hundred hours here.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.758
We don't know
what the hell we're looking for.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.888
Not to piss on Grand Cayman,

16:55.973 --> 16:58.391
but I think I can get you an additional
75 basis points

16:58.475 --> 17:00.393
in the Dutch Antilles. I say why not?

17:00.477 --> 17:02.437
Yeah, but the way the markets
keep jumping around, man,

17:02.521 --> 17:04.396
another four, six weeks,
who knows what the rates'll be?

17:04.481 --> 17:06.398
And have you seen
the latest Bloomberg report?

17:06.483 --> 17:09.484
- Shit is bleak out there.
- "Bloomberg reports"? Are you kidding me?

17:09.569 --> 17:11.404
Come on, college guys.
Let's not over-think it.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.489
Yeah, come on.
Dutch Antilles wanna pay us more money.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.157
- That's a no-brainer.
- I like the Dutch Antilles,

17:15.242 --> 17:17.702
as long as the banks don't pack up
and take my money overnight.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.163
Of course. 10% to the usual charities?

17:20.247 --> 17:21.873
- Absolutely.
- Cool by me.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.666
I chartered a jet.
It's taking off Van Nuys Airport tonight.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.629
Anybody wants to come,
I got your private parking passes right here.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.214
It'll be sweet.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.967
Man, life's looking pretty good
from right here.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.802
I'll let you know later.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.455
Nice house. Cool view.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.958
Great scotch.

18:07.669 --> 18:11.714
You know, jacking that news chopper
had "A.J." written all over it.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.841
How'd you get in my house?

18:15.469 --> 18:16.677
Please.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.888
They let you out early or what?

18:18.972 --> 18:21.766
Good behavior. About a year early.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.769
But I guess you guys kind of lost track, huh?

18:24.853 --> 18:28.231
No contact. That's what we agreed upon.
So, what's up?

18:29.566 --> 18:31.609
I think I'm gonna have another scotch.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.822
It's good shit, John.
You gonna drink with me, right?

18:36.031 --> 18:37.406
Sure you are.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.991
You see, I came to you, John,

18:39.076 --> 18:42.036
because you the one with that
higher consciousness and shit.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.081
- All right, I'm listening.
- Well, you asked what's up.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.043
I miss my homies. That's what's up.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.879
That, and some unfinished business.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.632
Your money from '04 is safe
and accruing interest.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.883
Gordon's got the bank account numbers.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.011
What about Lilli? Who's got her numbers?

19:00.055 --> 19:01.556
She's with Jake now.

19:07.187 --> 19:11.399
Well, good for them.
I got a deal we need to discuss.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.736
- A job.
- You're kidding me, right?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.530
You're coming at me with a job right now?

19:17.614 --> 19:19.323
Think I'd come at you on some bullshit?

19:19.783 --> 19:23.119
Once in a lifetime, John. You know me.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.996
I do my homework.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.455
All right, so what do you
want me to say here?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.166
You ain't got to say shit.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.086
Just remember I was the one left bleeding
on that fire escape in '04.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.339
And they tried everything they could
to flip me.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.718
I ain't budge, 'cause we had a deal.
I kept my end.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.722
I kept this, too. You owe me, bro.

19:42.806 --> 19:43.806
All of you.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.434
What were you, boosting Camaros
back in Riverside

19:46.518 --> 19:48.227
when me and Gordon decided to let you in?

19:48.687 --> 19:50.479
So, don't be so quick to write me off.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.446
All right, I'll talk to the boys
and I'll get back at you tomorrow.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.576
You do that. Love the place.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.412
Alarm system sucks, though.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.874
There she is.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.960
Hello. How's my baby G doing?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.837
I'm good, I'm fine.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.881
- You look good.
- I feel good.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.466
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.510
They tell me maybe
you finish the program next week.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.096
It's been a tough eight weeks.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.016
Don't worry. I'm gonna do it this time.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.060
That's what my mind
and my body's telling me.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.938
I'm with you. I'm with you.
You know that, right?

20:32.022 --> 20:34.106
- Yeah?
- I'm not gonna need these anymore.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.233
By the time I leave here,

20:35.317 --> 20:37.318
I'm gonna be cleaner
than the day I was born.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.822
You know I'm grateful, don't you?

20:41.907 --> 20:44.992
Stop it. You don't need to say that to me,
all right?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.620
- Did you get my letter?
- Yeah, sure did.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.167
I've been non-stop tripping over this,
I tell you.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.878
- Caribbean, huh?
- Look at the water.

20:56.171 --> 21:00.466
Clear and blue.
Cool and warm at the same time.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.052
I've just got to get back there.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.638
Soon as you're out of here,
I'm gonna take you there myself.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.515
- I promise.
- All right.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.352
I love you.

22:45.906 --> 22:46.989
Turn that off.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.532
I know, so I walk into my house.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.409
He's standing there,
he's drinking my whiskey.

22:50.827 --> 22:52.286
I was gonna shoot him
in the back of his head.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.371
Should've shot him.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.040
The guy's been out 24 hours,
already wants to do a job.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.417
- He's crazy.
- Or he's got huge balls.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.544
Yeah, Ghost doesn't play
when it comes to money.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.754
He's too smart for that.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.381
- The bastard's not that smart.
- That's for sure.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.507
He's clever, not smart.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.884
You guys, we always wait
at least a year between jobs.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.845
- There's a reason for that.
- Gordon, you guys go way back, right?

23:10.013 --> 23:11.222
Think he's being straight up?

23:11.306 --> 23:13.099
Ghost could've ratted us out
a long time ago,

23:13.183 --> 23:15.434
but he didn't. Kept his word.

23:15.519 --> 23:18.646
What's to stop him from doing exactly that
once we give him his cut from '04?

23:18.730 --> 23:19.939
- See, that's the problem.
- Yeah.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.066
- That's a big problem there.
- Something ain't right.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.484
- I don't trust him.
- Relax.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.736
- He's trouble.
- I think he's onto something, though.

23:26.613 --> 23:29.865
- He says it's big.
- Do I look like I care what he says?

23:32.202 --> 23:33.911
Well, whatever you decide to do,
I'm down with you.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.579
- All right.
- I'm going to the loft.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.123
Private party!

23:37.916 --> 23:39.625
- Where you going?
- None of your damn business!

23:41.211 --> 23:42.545
- Gentlemen.
- It's Lilli.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.006
- Baby, who ordered the Dom?
- That's for Johnny-boy.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.175
It's the girl in the green at the bar.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.805
She's cute.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.766
- Don't let her pay for it.
- No, no, she's gonna pay, man.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.934
This is how it's done. Let me show you.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.937
Slow down, lvy League.
This ain't the frat house, man.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.357
Well, that's some funny shit, man.
That's some funny shit.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.738
I'll come back up later.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.868
- Ghost.
- It's been a long time, girl.

24:14.369 --> 24:17.538
- When did you get out?
- Why? You miss me?

24:17.706 --> 24:20.791
Ghost. You need to back up.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.710
Easy, Jake. Easy.

24:23.253 --> 24:27.381
I wish you guys the best. Really.
It's the past.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.467
I'm here to discuss the future.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.051
If I may.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.721
Told you tomorrow, Ghost.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.557
I'm not here to bust any balls. Just business.

24:37.058 --> 24:38.058
A'ight?

24:39.060 --> 24:41.020
A.J. Any new tats?

24:41.771 --> 24:43.731
- Yeah, man, couple.
- Me, too.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.275
- G.
- Ghost.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.818
How's my man?

24:49.654 --> 24:51.071
I'm doing good, mate.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.540
Lot of tension in the room, huh?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.292
What do you want, Ghost?

25:04.169 --> 25:05.252
Goddamn.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.671
It's like that?

25:08.048 --> 25:09.507
It's like that.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.510
Well, I'll be brief.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.516
Let's say we go Italian Job on that ass.

25:26.983 --> 25:29.235
Why don't we take this upstairs, Ghost?

25:29.319 --> 25:30.736
Fair enough.

25:33.406 --> 25:36.575
Same plan as before, gentlemen.
25 to 30 mil.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.538
All the cash we can carry.
Got to move fast, though.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.872
When you say "fast," how fast?

25:42.499 --> 25:43.749
Next Tuesday.

25:44.501 --> 25:45.626
What?

25:45.919 --> 25:49.463
Ghost, you want us to take down
an armored truck in five days?

25:49.548 --> 25:51.799
I mean, it's not even worth talking about
unless you got the route,

25:51.883 --> 25:53.050
and they change the route all the time.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.511
- That's what screwed us last time.
- Yeah, man, you got the route?

25:55.595 --> 25:58.806
I got it. Exact one from next Tuesday.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.641
Any more questions?

26:01.059 --> 26:03.143
- How'd you get it?
- In the joint.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.187
I got in good with this Russian.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.148
Had the pleasure of keeping them guys
from Compton off his ass.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.235
In exchange, he had his comrades
on the outside

26:11.319 --> 26:13.612
put the arm down on the dispatcher.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.282
So the dispatcher do anything
to screw the job up,

26:16.950 --> 26:19.994
they're wiping out his whole family
back at the Ukraine.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.412
Down to the sheepdog.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.038
Why should we trust the Russians?

26:24.958 --> 26:26.584
They love their sheepdogs.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.378
All bullshit aside,

26:30.046 --> 26:33.841
I'm in for a quarter mil with the Russians
out my cut when the job's done.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.093
It's not your concern,

26:36.177 --> 26:38.804
so don't trust the Russians. Trust greed.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.181
- Why should we trust you?
- Well, shit, A.J.

26:41.266 --> 26:45.144
I'm fresh out. I ain't in no hurry to go back.

26:45.228 --> 26:48.397
Besides, why would I screw over my guys?

26:48.857 --> 26:51.150
Especially when
you're holding all my money, right?

26:51.318 --> 26:53.068
Okay. What about the setup?

26:53.194 --> 26:56.071
I mean, there's knowing the route,
and then there's the logistics, you know.

26:56.156 --> 26:59.283
Five days. Jake's right.
That's a real, real short fuse.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.493
That's where you come in.

27:01.578 --> 27:05.122
But I trust that when you and Jake
put your heads together, you'll figure it out.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.875
Either way, I need to know tonight.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.502
You ain't got the heart to pull it off, a'ight.

27:11.379 --> 27:14.048
We'll settle up on the money you owe me,
I'm sayonara.

27:17.719 --> 27:21.347
Appreciate your time, gentlemen.
Thanks for the cigar.

27:26.561 --> 27:28.646
- Hey, G, let me check out that route.
- Yeah.

27:28.730 --> 27:32.483
This is not the way we do things, gentlemen.
It's too fast, it's too rushed.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.902
It's a lot of money,
but this whole thing feels forced.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.446
Five days? Five?

27:37.864 --> 27:40.616
Yeah, man, but, you know,
we can get the setup right.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.784
Bet big, win big.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.369
It's the only way to play.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.414
We're takers, gents.
That's what we do for a living.

27:48.249 --> 27:49.333
We take.

27:49.709 --> 27:50.834
It's a lot of money, Jake.

27:53.046 --> 27:55.214
- And that's what we're here for.
- You sure about this?

27:56.341 --> 27:57.591
If it checks out.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.223
If it checks out, I'm in.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.360
- Yeah, what's up?
<i>- Thought you'd wanna know,</i>

28:16.444 --> 28:18.237
your Haitian buddy?

28:18.321 --> 28:20.698
His lawyerjust filed on you
for excessive force.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.033
All right. The guy was 6'5", he was resisting.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.284
What was I supposed to do?

28:24.411 --> 28:25.953
Yeah, well, you must've hurt his feelings.

28:26.037 --> 28:30.082
The bank. Hey, listen, what about the C-4
they used to blow the elevators?

28:30.166 --> 28:33.293
Well, from the taggants, forensics traced it
to a mining company out of Nevada,

28:33.378 --> 28:35.713
stolen about... About two months ago.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.506
All right. And what about the marked bills?

28:37.590 --> 28:41.051
Bank finally sent over a list.
Max is gonna fax out a memo right now.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.013
Listen, man,

28:45.890 --> 28:49.184
<i>it's been a couple of weeks now.</i>
<i>You hear anDhing from Amanda?</i>

28:49.394 --> 28:51.520
Listen, I appreciate it,
but I don't need any help.

28:51.604 --> 28:54.940
We can work it out on our own. But thanks.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.152
All right. I'll talk to you later.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.997
All right, so, for this route
Ghost is talking about.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.375
The only place we stand a chance
is right there.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.002
- What's there?
- It's an old subway car turnaround.

29:15.503 --> 29:17.588
It's large enough,
and it runs parallel to the street.

29:17.672 --> 29:20.257
It's kind of perfect.
I mean, we can get access on Hope Street,

29:20.341 --> 29:22.926
but I say we hold them up
at Olive and Fourth.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.887
All right.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.347
And we need to get down there
first and get some intel on,

29:27.432 --> 29:32.102
you know, street patterns, traffic density,
that sort of thing, but it looks good.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.522
Once we determine the blast radius
and street density,

29:35.607 --> 29:38.484
I can tell you how much C-4
you're gonna need to score.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.818
What about the exits?

29:40.487 --> 29:41.945
Work in progress, G.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.698
You know, we got to get down there first,
check it out.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.576
- Give me some exits.
- You got it.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.369
- It's good work.
- Cool.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.789
- All right, gang.
- Good to go.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.416
Easy money, baby. Same as before.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.794
All the cash is in the front truck.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.338
Second truck's totally empty. Just an escort.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.216
Two men up front, two men in the back.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.927
Pump action 12-gauge
and.40 caliber Glocks.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.261
Maybe 9mm.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.972
They may have upgraded
their communication by now,

30:09.057 --> 30:10.724
but the same standard bulletproof windows.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.646
They ain't gonna know what hit them.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.909
Here we go. Must've taken up the tracks.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.089
That's it.

30:57.605 --> 30:59.231
Yeah, he's still working it.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.650
Got brand-new wheels to show for it, too.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.278
All right, let's go.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.905
All right, wait for my go-ahead.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.623
- Good morning, Franco. Nice wheels!
- What do you guys want?

31:16.708 --> 31:17.833
- Get up against the car.
- Turn around.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.793
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm clean, man.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.212
Hands off. All right?
Why don't you move your car?

31:22.463 --> 31:24.464
What do you know about some
C-4 boosted out of Nevada?

31:24.549 --> 31:25.799
Nevada? I don't know nothing about that.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.176
Come on, if it's guns or explosives,
you heard something about it.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.721
You know, you get busted again,
you're facing 10 years minimum.

31:30.805 --> 31:32.806
- You know that, right?
- I know this is a public place.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.350
I ain't done nothing.
So, why don't you move your car?

31:35.852 --> 31:37.394
- Do me a favor.
- Hey, Hatch.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.062
- Look at this!
- What you got?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.565
- What's that?
- Come on, Franco.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.567
- It's a damn shame.
- Looks like you caught a nail.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.319
- Yeah, you got a flat.
- Twice.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.571
- Come on.
- You got a spare in the trunk, right?

31:47.655 --> 31:49.698
- Come on, I'll help you. Come on.
- You wanna check my trunk,

31:49.782 --> 31:51.909
why don't you go get yourselves a warrant?

31:51.993 --> 31:55.913
Hey, Dispatch, we got a disabled vehicle
on 9th and the 110.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.248
How long would it take to get here?

31:58.333 --> 31:59.791
<i>Yeah, right around the corner.</i>

31:59.876 --> 32:01.001
You got one in the area.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.879
That's great. It's my lucky day.
I'll see you in a minute.

32:03.963 --> 32:06.048
You guys must think I'm stupid
or something, right?

32:06.132 --> 32:08.508
- Bring it in!
- Man, what the hell is this?

32:08.593 --> 32:10.260
Come on! This has got to be illegal!

32:10.345 --> 32:11.386
- No.
- Entrapment or some shit!

32:11.471 --> 32:13.221
This looks like a disabled vehicle to me.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.264
Hey, don't worry about it.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.725
We'll do a full inventory,
including everything in the trunk.

32:16.809 --> 32:20.228
Yeah, we wouldn't want you
accusing the LAPD of stealing anything.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.898
- Hey, come on, all right? Hey!
- Give us something, Franco.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.943
- Give us something.
- This here is bullshit! Come on, man!

32:26.027 --> 32:27.778
Come on, Franco, what do you wanna do?

32:27.862 --> 32:29.905
You know, you two guys,
you're a couple of...

32:29.989 --> 32:31.365
- All right, hook it up!
- What are you doing?

32:31.449 --> 32:33.283
- Come on! Be nice, it's a new car!
- What are you doing?

32:33.368 --> 32:35.786
Okay, okay, okay, all right!
I got something for you guys, all right?

32:35.870 --> 32:36.870
- Come here.
- What do you got?

32:36.955 --> 32:39.247
There's... They got these guys,
they're trying to go upscale.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.457
- They're planning something big.
- What?

32:40.625 --> 32:42.000
They're definitely planning
something real big.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.877
- Like what?
- I don't know like what.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.004
But I know they're gonna use a C-4
on the job.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.140
What's up?

32:57.475 --> 32:58.558
'Sup.

33:18.788 --> 33:19.830
You alone?

33:20.915 --> 33:22.916
Like I said on the phone.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.210
He's clean.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.546
- No one.
- You Paulie?

33:28.339 --> 33:29.923
Like the sign says.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.093
So, you're the one who wants some C-4?

33:33.469 --> 33:34.511
Like I said on the phone.

33:34.595 --> 33:38.390
I know, the street's gone dry.
Someone bought up a big pile of it.

33:38.474 --> 33:39.599
That what brings you to me?

33:40.601 --> 33:42.477
- Smart man.
- Yeah.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.773
So, let me see your category one permit.

33:46.983 --> 33:50.944
Permit? Thought this was
supposed to be simple.

33:51.237 --> 33:54.322
It is. You got a permit.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.744
My category one.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.583
Yeah, it is simple.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.502
See, we take your money,
and you don't get shit.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.494
Get over here!

34:50.004 --> 34:51.670
Hey, whoa! Hey. Come on.

34:53.716 --> 34:56.551
Move, I put three holes in your head
like a bowling ball, big boy.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.387
Should've kept it simple, huh?

35:00.473 --> 35:02.432
- Thought you might need some backup.
- Backup?

35:02.517 --> 35:04.101
Looked like you getting your ass kicked.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.770
Man, I told you guys to wait in the car.

35:06.854 --> 35:09.272
- You had it under control, huh?
- Yeah, I did, actually.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.108
- Where's the C-4?
- It's in the shed.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.859
- Speak English! Where's the C-4?
- It's in the shed!

35:12.944 --> 35:14.778
- Back in the shed!
- In the shed?

35:14.862 --> 35:16.780
- It's in the shed?
- Back in the shed.

35:18.866 --> 35:19.908
It's in the shed.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.163
Nice job squeezing Franco.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.958
Looking at 10 years,
funny how he gave up that address.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.042
Think it's the FedCal guys?

35:29.460 --> 35:32.045
Only so many people know
how to use C-4, Chief.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.422
- Duncan!
- Lieutenant Carver?

35:34.507 --> 35:36.675
- Moving and grooving, Jack!
- I wanna speak to Detective Welles!

35:36.759 --> 35:38.218
I can't do this right now.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.053
We're executing a search warrant.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.763
Police work. Remember what that is?

35:41.848 --> 35:43.181
Internal Affairs will have to wait.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.642
Hey, you call me, Welles. Get back to me!

35:46.060 --> 35:47.602
You don't want me to
have to come find you!

35:49.522 --> 35:51.606
The hell is wrong with you,
coming down here now?

35:52.066 --> 35:54.151
I wanna show you something.

36:11.085 --> 36:12.252
Police, on the ground now!

36:14.630 --> 36:15.672
Go!

36:46.787 --> 36:48.455
Welles, I got nothing.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.838
Hatch, he's coming up on Spring!

37:41.342 --> 37:42.467
Shit!

37:53.271 --> 37:54.562
Welles!

38:06.033 --> 38:08.535
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.626
Our two dead guys,
Ethan and Constantine Symanski.

38:16.711 --> 38:20.380
Brothers. Suspected Russian mob,
but they're no good for the FedCal job.

38:20.673 --> 38:23.049
- Why's that?
- INS said they were being sworn in

38:23.134 --> 38:25.051
as U.S. Citizens at the time of the robbery.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.679
- Couple patriots, huh?
- Yeah.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.889
They burned a bunch of stuff
before we got here.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.267
This is all that was left.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.561
Looks like a map of LA.

38:35.229 --> 38:37.272
Yeah. Maybe.

38:38.816 --> 38:44.029
Look at this stuff.
C-4, automatic weapons, blasting caps.

38:45.072 --> 38:47.741
They were definitely onto something big.

38:53.622 --> 38:59.294
Staples Center, Pershing Square,
Union Station.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.922
The hell were they up to?

39:17.938 --> 39:20.607
- We're good to go.
- Jake's all connected. You ready?

39:20.775 --> 39:21.858
All right, Jesse, we're up.

39:22.485 --> 39:23.610
Show it to us.

39:32.745 --> 39:33.912
Nice.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.872
All right, tell Jake to stop showing off.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.457
All right, man, turn it off.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.250
- Good job.
- Good job.

39:41.754 --> 39:44.839
But the point is, I mean,
can we do it in three days?

39:45.800 --> 39:47.759
Not only can we do it,
but we're gonna play it safe.

39:47.843 --> 39:50.095
All right, we're gonna drill at
about an inch an hour,

39:50.179 --> 39:52.222
16 holes in 64 hours.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.766
Split the work, keep the schedule.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.893
So, that leaves us one last day for prep?

39:56.977 --> 39:59.396
Exactly. Enough time for Jake and I to wire.
It's good.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.524
All right, I'm gonna call Rahway
and see if we can get down there tonight.

40:06.612 --> 40:07.612
Who's there?

40:11.826 --> 40:13.159
G!

40:13.452 --> 40:16.121
Naomi. What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the...

40:16.205 --> 40:17.997
I know, I know, I...

40:18.999 --> 40:20.625
- Catch up with you later, man.
- All right, man.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.293
Wow, look at this place.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.586
What is this? Naomi?

40:24.004 --> 40:26.339
Look, I am really clean now. I feel great.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.424
Naomi, what are you talking about?

40:27.508 --> 40:29.843
Look, another week in that place
wouldn't have made any difference.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.095
- We spoke about this, didn't we?
- Come on.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.430
I was doing really well.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.099
I asked if I could leave early,
and they said yes.

40:36.183 --> 40:38.643
If you don't believe me, call them.

40:38.727 --> 40:42.355
Look, they told us that when you get out,
you got to have a plan.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.024
Yeah? Without a plan, you're dead.

40:45.651 --> 40:48.987
So I started thinking about you and me,
our plan, and going home.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.071
And that's gonna happen.

40:50.156 --> 40:53.241
You had one more week, that's all,
one more week.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.618
It's a busy time for me, Naomi.

40:57.621 --> 41:00.790
- You don't remember it, do you?
- No, I don't.

41:01.333 --> 41:05.545
Look at how cute you were.
Mum was so beautiful.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.841
I was truly happy back then.

41:10.718 --> 41:14.637
I'm not gonna be right until I get back there,
so I can start again.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.557
And we can. In just three days.

41:18.267 --> 41:20.143
I'm working. I need to put you in a hotel.

41:20.227 --> 41:21.478
What? Why can't I stay here?

41:21.562 --> 41:24.939
You can. It's just a bad time for me.

41:25.983 --> 41:27.484
All right?

41:28.527 --> 41:29.611
Yeah.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.491
Well, I can tell you it's not a street map.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.618
It's some kind of a public works project.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.787
But without a reference number,
there's no way I can work it out.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.456
All right. Thanks.

41:41.790 --> 41:42.832
You got it.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.454
Rivers, Delonte.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.135
Put your body in it.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.973
Right here, Eddie. Up with it.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.642
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.937
Hey, Eddie.
Take it easy on Uncle Jack, all right?

42:46.772 --> 42:51.234
Time out. I did some work last night.
Wanted to talk to you.

42:51.318 --> 42:53.278
Hey, if you're gonna puke, do it on the grass.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.446
Come on, Dad, let us finish.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.990
Yeah, why don't you take my place?

42:57.074 --> 42:59.659
I'm good. Go ahead, keep playing, Eddie.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.664
- Eddie looks like he's doing a lot better.
- Yeah, he's doing great, man.

43:04.748 --> 43:08.001
I mean, it's been about a month
since his last dialysis.

43:08.085 --> 43:11.546
Down for a couple days,
then he bounces back. I mean...

43:13.340 --> 43:14.966
- So, anyway, what's up?
- All right.

43:15.050 --> 43:18.011
You remember the jewelry job
in Koreatown, few years back?

43:18.220 --> 43:20.930
They used wires
and went from one building to the other?

43:21.015 --> 43:23.016
Guard got loose.
He ended up shooting one of them?

43:23.100 --> 43:25.101
Yeah. The guard ended up being
like a big hero.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.936
The perp got shot on a fire escape, right?

43:27.021 --> 43:30.440
Name's Delonte Rivers, a.k.a. Ghost.

43:30.524 --> 43:32.692
He just finished serving five at Chino.

43:33.277 --> 43:36.988
And somehow, his prison ID ended up
at the Russians.

43:37.197 --> 43:38.323
I saw it in the Polaroids.

43:38.407 --> 43:40.116
So, you think this guy's good
for the FedCal heist?

43:40.200 --> 43:43.620
I don't know. He was released the same day
the bank was hit.

43:43.871 --> 43:45.913
There's got to be some type of
connection there, right?

43:48.584 --> 43:50.376
Yeah, Max. What's up?

43:51.378 --> 43:53.338
- Morning, Jack.
- Hey, Monica.

43:55.549 --> 43:56.716
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

43:57.509 --> 43:59.552
- Marketing rep.
- You got to be kidding me.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.472
Look, Max, you can just tell Carver
he can call me Monday.

44:02.556 --> 44:04.015
I don't work weekends, okay?

44:07.686 --> 44:09.145
Internal Affairs.

44:09.772 --> 44:11.648
Well, can I make you some breakfast, Jack?

44:11.732 --> 44:15.818
No, that's all right. I got to pick Sunday up.
We're gonna go look at some landmarks.

44:15.903 --> 44:18.655
- I'll see you Monday.
- See you, Jack.

44:19.573 --> 44:22.033
So, what do we got?
What's the assignment for today?

44:22.117 --> 44:25.578
After we go to the Walk of Fame,
I'm supposed to write about us going there.

44:25.663 --> 44:30.041
Honey, the Walk of Fame's not a landmark,
it's a tourist trap.

44:31.043 --> 44:34.504
I got a better landmark.
Let's go over to La Brea Tar Pits,

44:34.588 --> 44:36.464
and then afterwards
we can go to the museum,

44:36.548 --> 44:37.632
we can look at the fossils.

44:37.716 --> 44:40.843
And then after that, we can go to
the Farmer's Market and get some burgers.

44:40.928 --> 44:44.389
Good idea.
Burgers and shakes at the Farmer's Market.

44:44.473 --> 44:45.973
Yeah, what do you got for me?

44:47.059 --> 44:49.769
Sweetheart, we're gonna have
to make a stop somewhere first.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.568
When I got your message from last night,
I pulled Rivers' file,

44:57.653 --> 44:59.904
saw he was due this afternoon.

44:59.988 --> 45:02.115
Cons like him,
they're good for a visit or two.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.742
But four years of lockdown,
I wouldn't bet on him.

45:05.536 --> 45:08.579
There's your boy now.
Want me to hold him? Rattle his cage?

45:08.872 --> 45:11.582
No. No, keep it routine.

45:12.459 --> 45:15.628
- You got an address on this guy?
- Some dump in Long Beach.

45:16.422 --> 45:17.672
Probably good for a week, if that.

45:17.965 --> 45:19.298
All right, thanks.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.595
Little Tokyo. Let's go.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.349
Now are we going to the museum?

45:29.059 --> 45:31.144
Just a sec, honey. We will.

45:38.777 --> 45:40.987
- Anything else?
- Give me a couple of these, too.

45:41.405 --> 45:42.739
Here, on the right.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.366
- Thanks, man.
- You got it.

46:08.056 --> 46:09.682
- What's up?
- You're late.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.393
- How'd the parole meeting go?
- We good.

46:13.187 --> 46:16.355
You know they try and turn pissing in a cup
into a seven-game series.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.440
We straight, though.

46:17.524 --> 46:19.025
- Can I help you?
- Relish.

46:24.281 --> 46:25.615
- Jesse.
- What's up?

46:25.699 --> 46:28.117
What's happening? Where the guys?

46:28.202 --> 46:30.077
I'm take-out. They're waiting on me.

46:30.162 --> 46:31.287
Sounds good.

46:32.289 --> 46:34.999
- So, did you get it?
- Come on, man. It's me.

46:36.210 --> 46:37.543
What are you looking at, Daddy?

46:38.545 --> 46:40.129
Just a second, honey.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.423
Same thing the rescue workers use.

46:42.508 --> 46:45.218
Easy as shit. Works just like a can opener.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.261
- Speak to the dispatcher?
- Yeah.

46:49.056 --> 46:52.433
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I spoke to him this morning. We good.

46:53.519 --> 46:55.978
- Come on, man.
- Hey, the route's a lock, G.

46:58.565 --> 46:59.565
Talk to you later.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.943
Hey, man, find you something else
to worry about, G.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.653
I got you, homes.

47:07.741 --> 47:08.825
What?

47:21.046 --> 47:22.338
Hold on to your seat, honey.

47:26.677 --> 47:27.969
What are you doing, idiot?

47:45.404 --> 47:48.114
You see a pen, baby? No?

47:59.334 --> 48:02.837
There, you see that blue sedan back there?
Two cars back?

48:04.965 --> 48:06.799
- Yeah.
- He's sharking us.

48:09.094 --> 48:10.177
Make a right.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.599
You have a pen, baby? Anything?

48:29.031 --> 48:30.948
All right, make another right.

48:40.500 --> 48:42.126
- He's staying with us.
- Yeah.

48:42.210 --> 48:43.419
Let's pull over.

48:46.506 --> 48:49.967
- Who are they?
- They're just some guys.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.691
- Is it a cop?
- With a kid?

49:11.239 --> 49:13.699
What's so important that you'd drag my ass
all the way down here?

49:13.784 --> 49:15.743
- I found him, Hatch.
- Who?

49:15.827 --> 49:19.455
Him, FedCal. Gordon Cozier.
I mean, look at that.

49:19.539 --> 49:21.290
Same height, same build, same everything.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.792
Wait, hold on. What are you talking about?

49:22.876 --> 49:24.961
- Where's all this coming from?
- I followed that guy, Rivers,

49:25.045 --> 49:26.253
from his parole meeting.

49:26.338 --> 49:28.506
- And he gets out of a cab downtown.
- With Sunday?

49:28.590 --> 49:30.466
What, are you gunning for
Father of the Year now?

49:30.550 --> 49:33.219
And from my car,
I see him go to this hot-dog stand.

49:33.303 --> 49:36.013
And Cozier's there.
Now, he's got his back to me.

49:36.098 --> 49:38.516
But I swear I see Rivers
pass something to him.

49:38.809 --> 49:43.104
A second later, this guy on a motorcycle,
he looks at Cozier.

49:43.855 --> 49:46.148
And then right before he takes off, bam,

49:46.566 --> 49:48.776
the same gesture
the asshole used in the bank.

49:49.069 --> 49:52.029
And then I followed Cozier
and got his license plate number.

49:52.114 --> 49:54.073
Yeah, it's very official. What is that, crayon?

49:54.157 --> 49:55.658
Look, man, I'm telling you, it's him.

49:55.742 --> 49:58.285
Except you can't see his face.
The guy's got a clean sheet.

49:58.370 --> 49:59.829
Come on, man, you follow an ex-con

49:59.913 --> 50:02.832
who's no good for the bank job to,
what, a hot-dog stand?

50:02.916 --> 50:04.000
- Then he meets somebody...
- Listen to me.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.376
Maybe he meets somebody there,
maybe he doesn't.

50:05.460 --> 50:08.045
- Maybe he passes something...
- Look, Hatch, I'm telling you I was there.

50:08.130 --> 50:09.171
...and buys a hot-dog
with ketchup and relish,

50:09.256 --> 50:11.090
- and then, some guy on a motorcycle says...
- Call me crazy.

50:11.174 --> 50:12.341
"So long," and rides off.

50:12.426 --> 50:14.802
Come on, man, give a brother a break.
Are you kidding me?

50:14.886 --> 50:17.555
Can we still go
to the Farmer's Market, Daddy?

50:18.348 --> 50:20.933
Baby, I'm sorry. Geez.

50:22.936 --> 50:25.938
I can't believe it's this late.
We can go eat somewhere else.

50:26.023 --> 50:29.525
Just gonna take a few minutes here.
Wherever you want.

50:32.487 --> 50:33.779
Shit.

50:34.948 --> 50:38.200
Your daddy loves you very much,
you know that, right?

50:39.244 --> 50:41.704
- Don't ever forget that, okay?
- Okay.

50:45.125 --> 50:47.251
Take care of the real stuff, Jack.

50:52.799 --> 50:53.966
Hey, how about some pizza, huh?

50:55.260 --> 50:56.677
I just wanna go home.

51:02.642 --> 51:03.684
Let's go.

51:05.145 --> 51:06.187
Well, when'd it happen?

51:08.482 --> 51:11.317
No, no, no. It's all right.
If she comes back, do me a favor,

51:11.401 --> 51:13.569
you just keep her there, all right, Jimmy,
and you call me.

51:13.653 --> 51:16.572
She doesn't leave the hotel.
Do you understand me?

51:16.990 --> 51:18.324
All right.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.202
Naomi?

51:21.620 --> 51:25.664
I left Jimmy some money at the hotel.
He didn't put it in the safe.

51:26.249 --> 51:29.794
- She took it?
- She's gone and so is the money. Shit!

51:32.589 --> 51:34.006
- What you doing, mate?
- I'm pulling over.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.634
- Why?
- 'Cause you got to find her.

51:37.928 --> 51:40.554
I'll take your time in the tunnel tonight.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.232
- Thanks.
- You got it.

52:43.618 --> 52:44.618
Damn it.

53:24.910 --> 53:27.244
- How's it hanging?
- Funny guy.

53:30.790 --> 53:32.750
All right, come on down.

53:33.126 --> 53:35.336
We'll go hot tomorrow morning.

53:36.504 --> 53:37.546
This is gonna be lovely.

53:45.722 --> 53:46.931
Hey, G.

53:47.807 --> 53:49.183
We good?

53:49.267 --> 53:50.684
All signs point to it.

53:51.978 --> 53:54.438
- Any word from Naomi?
- No.

53:57.651 --> 53:58.859
This time, I think she's gone.

53:59.319 --> 54:00.653
She'll turn up fine.

54:00.987 --> 54:02.821
What makes you so sure?

54:02.906 --> 54:05.157
If I had any family left, that's where I'd be.

54:11.456 --> 54:14.792
You know, if anything goes wrong
tomorrow, we can't let him walk away.

54:16.753 --> 54:18.337
He could still hang us for '04.

54:19.047 --> 54:20.506
I'll bring the insurance.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.217
There he is. How's it going, Ghost?

54:23.301 --> 54:24.885
I can't call it, gentlemen.

54:25.011 --> 54:26.553
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

54:26.638 --> 54:28.180
- G. Cool.
- Yeah, man.

54:30.350 --> 54:34.645
Feels good to be back in action again.
It's like old times, huh?

54:37.774 --> 54:39.984
So, where we meeting at after the drop?

54:40.443 --> 54:42.861
Scott's giving me the information.
I'll let you know tomorrow.

54:46.866 --> 54:48.784
"Come sip from the cup of destruction."

54:49.744 --> 54:53.664
- Genghis Khan.
- Yeah. One of my heroes.

54:54.541 --> 54:57.293
Saw what he wanted,
reached out and took it.

54:57.377 --> 54:59.253
Like us, tomorrow.

55:01.381 --> 55:02.798
Just like us.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.637
- To tomorrow.
- To tomorrow.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.097
To tomorrow.

55:21.234 --> 55:22.526
Yeah?

55:24.112 --> 55:29.408
Slow down, slow down. What?
Where are you?

55:32.120 --> 55:34.455
All right. Wait, no, no, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

55:54.059 --> 55:56.310
Where do I find Processing?

55:56.394 --> 55:58.437
Through the far door. Follow the yellow line.

56:05.153 --> 56:06.570
Where's Vice?

56:07.405 --> 56:09.281
Take the stairs to the basement.

56:11.076 --> 56:13.035
We got your fax last week
about the bank bills,

56:13.119 --> 56:15.537
so when we nailed this scum
with a bunch of fresh hundreds,

56:15.622 --> 56:16.955
thought we'd call you.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.707
This low-life? You gotta be kidding me.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.335
He was hustling some stolen shit
with his girlfriend when we stopped him.

56:21.711 --> 56:24.421
None of the bills were marked, but we figure
they gotta be from some job.

56:24.506 --> 56:25.714
Did you question him?

56:25.799 --> 56:27.800
No. He didn't go easy.

56:28.676 --> 56:30.719
He's high as hell, too.
We decided to let him chill.

56:30.804 --> 56:34.181
All right. Let me talk to this guy.

56:38.478 --> 56:41.897
All right, I don't have time for this bullshit.
Where did you get the bills?

56:44.651 --> 56:46.151
I got him!

56:47.153 --> 56:49.696
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Where did you get the bills?

56:49.781 --> 56:52.199
- It was a loan, man, it was a loan!
- A loan. Bullshit!

56:54.702 --> 56:57.413
I want a name. Give me a name.

56:57.497 --> 56:59.498
- Naomi.
- Naomi what?

57:00.500 --> 57:05.629
- Naomi what? She got a last name?
- I don't know, man! I just met her.

57:05.713 --> 57:06.755
You bust her, too?

57:06.840 --> 57:09.633
Yeah, her name's Naomi Cozier.

57:09.884 --> 57:13.512
Cozier? Did you hear that, Hatch?

57:14.472 --> 57:15.597
Yeah.

57:16.641 --> 57:19.435
I ain't going back to no hotel
to sit on my own.

57:19.519 --> 57:21.061
Right, you ain't going back to the hotel,

57:21.146 --> 57:23.147
you ain't going
to the freaking Caribbean either.

57:23.231 --> 57:25.399
You're going back to the rehab
to start your program again.

57:25.483 --> 57:27.317
- Hell, no, I ain't!
- Yes, you are!

57:27.402 --> 57:30.112
I'm tired of them nurses and doctors
making you stand up

57:30.196 --> 57:31.613
and chat your business in front of strangers.

57:31.698 --> 57:36.743
Every time, you do the same thing!
Every time! Two days out of rehab!

57:36.828 --> 57:39.288
Just two days
and you're in the police station already.

57:39.372 --> 57:41.248
Where's the money I gave you?
Is it in your veins?

57:41.332 --> 57:43.125
You know, your problem is
you're too into my shit.

57:43.209 --> 57:45.419
Let me see your arm. Your shit.
You're not into your own shit!

57:45.503 --> 57:47.463
Why don't you get a life?
You don't care about me.

57:47.547 --> 57:49.089
You wouldn't even let me stay
at your apartment.

57:49.174 --> 57:51.800
- That's right.
- You're ashamed of me. And I raised you!

57:51.885 --> 57:54.303
You raised me?
My crackhead sister raised me?

57:54.387 --> 57:56.638
- Can't even raise yourself.
- You ungrateful bastard!

57:56.723 --> 57:58.557
- Shut up.
- But you ain't worth shit, man.

57:58.641 --> 58:00.559
- I should've let Welfare take you!
- You're right, you're right.

58:00.643 --> 58:01.810
Wonder.

58:02.187 --> 58:03.604
Naomi!

58:05.690 --> 58:09.109
No! Naomi! Naomi!

58:17.911 --> 58:20.579
Gordon Cozier.
Signed for her 20 minutes ago.

58:22.499 --> 58:25.501
- Second time in two days.
- Yeah, I hear you.

58:25.585 --> 58:29.755
Even if we tie those bills to a certain job,
it doesn't prove Cozier did anything.

58:29.839 --> 58:32.466
Question him now, he lawyers up,
splits town. We can blow this case.

58:32.550 --> 58:35.093
If we can put him in the elevators
on the day of the heist,

58:35.178 --> 58:37.262
we'll have plenty to talk to him about.

58:46.773 --> 58:49.399
It's time. Let's go, Casanova.

58:50.944 --> 58:52.569
I'll see you tonight.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.113
You be careful.

58:56.533 --> 58:58.158
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

59:00.995 --> 59:03.288
Come on, lover boy! Let's go, mate!

59:07.460 --> 59:10.629
Got a job to do, baby. Come on.

59:17.387 --> 59:18.887
Let's go, let's go!

59:41.077 --> 59:43.161
You want a coffee? Donut? Anything?

59:43.329 --> 59:44.830
Naw. I'm okay.

59:46.207 --> 59:48.500
Hey, Jack. Carver wants to see you.

59:48.585 --> 59:51.420
Not now, Max.
We're getting close on this FedCal job.

59:51.504 --> 59:53.380
It's not a request, Detective Welles.

59:57.218 --> 59:58.510
Orders, Jack.

01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:01.513
All right.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.346
This is chicken shit, Chief.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:45.682
The Haitian, the Russians.
I make judgment calls every day.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:47.851
- The union says I get an attorney...
- Before you go on about this,

01:00:47.935 --> 01:00:49.227
- you need to...
...just like the assholes

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.562
- I gotta deal with out there.
- Jack, stop!

01:00:50.688 --> 01:00:54.775
Look, if you still want to see a lawyer
in five minutes, you can have one.

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:58.570
Sit down.

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:06.828
<i>Get down! Get on the ground!</i>
<i>Get on the ground! Spread your legs!</i>

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.413
<i>- Keep your head down.</i>
- The day you busted the Haitian,

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.249
Narcotics had surveillance set up
in the building across the street.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.168
<i>- Shut up! Stay down!</i>
<i>- I said they'd give you money!</i>

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:14.961
<i>- What? What money?</i>
<i>- Money, right there!</i>

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:19.383
<i>Stay there, don't move! All right.</i>
<i>All right, get out of here. Go.</i>

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:42.489
Turn it off. All right, turn it off.

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:44.199
I wanted you to know
who you were working with.

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:47.494
Felt I owed you that much.

01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:50.789
Internal Affairs is bringing charges.
Papers are being drawn up today.

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:52.833
You wanna drop Hatcher? I understand.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:57.546
No, no. No. No.

01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:04.553
How'd it go?

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:06.930
You know, same old, same old.

01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:09.266
Shouldn't have roughed up that drug dealer,
you know?

01:02:09.475 --> 01:02:11.601
- That's the beef? That's it?
- Yeah.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.520
Warning, short and sweet.

01:02:13.604 --> 01:02:18.483
Check it out. That's our guy. We got him.

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:22.446
Time to turn up the heat on Mr. Cozier.
Let's go pay him a visit.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:35.000
All right, we're hot. Ready to rock, man.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.334
All right. Kill the traffic light.

01:02:45.678 --> 01:02:46.970
Let's go.

01:02:48.222 --> 01:02:50.015
Officer on duty.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:53.685
All right, Officer.
Package is due in five minutes.

01:02:55.354 --> 01:02:57.147
Crow's nest. Put an eye on him.

01:02:57.231 --> 01:02:58.273
Copy that.

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.074
You're driving.

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:10.368
Come on, let's go!

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.964
Come on, man. What's wrong with you?

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.638
Why'd you do it, Eddie?

01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:35.018
Why'd you take the money?

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.896
What are you... What are you talking about?

01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:41.733
They got it on tape.

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:46.738
Why'd you do it?

01:03:48.574 --> 01:03:49.741
Shit, man.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:04:00.669
Monica's laid off. We got a mortgage.
Insurance doesn't pay shit.

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.422
All these medical bills.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:07.759
You gotta help me, Jack.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:13.557
It was right there.
It was right there, and I took it.

01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:16.101
Why didn't you come to me?

01:04:18.312 --> 01:04:19.646
I'm Eddie's godfather.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.400
Come on. You're like my brother.

01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:26.069
The kind of money I'm talking about,
you couldn't save it in a lifetime.

01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:35.036
Look, you've had my back
for the last six years.

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:39.040
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to help you,
okay?

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:43.211
Yeah.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.225
Package is late.

01:04:57.310 --> 01:05:01.479
Must've gotten hung up. They'll be here.
Goddamn! Get off my ass.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:04.107
This is not good. This is not good.

01:05:04.191 --> 01:05:07.277
Let me know, G. I'm ready.

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.782
Come on, boys, have some faith.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:14.701
I never trusted this guy.
This is bad, we gotta do something.

01:05:14.785 --> 01:05:15.827
This is LA, man. Nothing runs on time.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.705
Damn all that. We got a shitload of C-4,
and we're live down here. Come on.

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:19.748
Just be cool, all right?

01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:21.875
Where the hell is it, Ghost?
Talk to me. Where is it?

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:23.835
<i>They're coming, God damn it.</i>
<i>They'll be here.</i>

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:25.587
Say the word, G. I'll send it.

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:28.840
<i>Y'all need to relax. I told you they coming.</i>
<i>Damn!</i>

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:30.800
G, we gotta make a move. Come on, man.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:31.885
All right!

01:05:33.846 --> 01:05:34.971
Where you at, John?

01:05:37.683 --> 01:05:39.351
I know you up there, son of a bitch.

01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:42.520
<i>Well? Is there anDhing?</i>

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.357
Nada. If he bolts, this may be
our last shot, right now.

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:49.194
- G.
<i>- Everybody, stay sharp.</i>

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.947
<i>They'll be here, G.</i>
<i>Theyjust running a little behind.</i>

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.698
We gotta do something. Come on.

01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:56.910
Come on, bitch. Where are you?

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:00.956
Take him out.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:12.509
They're here! They're here, God damn it!
I told you they were coming!

01:06:12.593 --> 01:06:14.052
All right, hold up, hold up!

01:06:14.595 --> 01:06:15.720
<i>Buckle up, boys!</i>

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:18.473
<i>They're turning down the ramp now.</i>

01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:20.141
Train's about to leave the station.

01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:27.691
<i>A'ight, G. Here they come.</i>

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:31.736
<i>Merging onto 4th.</i>

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.706
God damn it. You kidding me?

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:46.418
What's the holdup?

01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:51.339
Come on, guys, I'm holding traffic.
Just give me the word.

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:53.591
All right, boys, we've still got cars
inside the cones here.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.343
All right, keep me posted.

01:06:57.888 --> 01:06:58.888
Come on.

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:01.307
Come on, already! Yo, what's up?

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:04.853
- Let's go!
- You gonna move this or what?

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:07.564
Cones look clear to me. Holla at me.

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:09.441
Go on ahead and wave them through,
Officer.

01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:11.776
Finally!

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:15.280
Where you going?

01:07:21.328 --> 01:07:22.620
Showtime, boys!

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.289
- All right, it's on.
- All right, here we go.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.374
- It's on!
<i>- It's in your hands now!</i>

01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:29.169
<i>Let's get paid, man!</i>

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:30.628
Fifty yards!

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:34.382
Twenty-five yards! Ten yards!

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:36.301
- Look out! Bike!
<i>- Hit it!</i>

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.807
Holy shit! Goddamn bicyclist!

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.518
Shit!

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.228
- Jesus Christ!
- You all right?

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:48.396
Damn it, too soon!

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:49.647
<i>I still see the trucks!</i>

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.399
We missed! Where is it?

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:52.859
- Truck stopped short.
- What's going on?

01:07:52.943 --> 01:07:54.903
- Shit!
- God damn it, Jake, you went too early.

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:56.154
Shut up, Ghost, shut up!

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.740
The street blew up! We're in trouble.
We gotta get out of here!

01:07:58.824 --> 01:08:00.742
Stay in that truck! We'll get you out of this!

01:08:00.826 --> 01:08:03.119
- Get out and move that traffic, let's go!
<i>- G, now what?</i>

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.246
<i>- What we doing?</i>
- Crow's nest! Where are you, crow's nest?

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:06.581
- Talk to me, talk to me!
- Jake, it's a bust, man.

01:08:06.665 --> 01:08:07.874
- We gotta get out of here!
- What are we doing, G?

01:08:07.958 --> 01:08:10.001
- I can't see shit!
- Follow procedure! Stay in that truck!

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.836
- Okay, let's clear this!
- G, call it off!

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.296
- No, no, hold on!
- What are y'all doing?

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.422
G!

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:19.051
Abort! Abort!

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.970
All hell broke loose up here, man!

01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:24.765
G!

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.268
Let's go, let's go!
We gotta abort this, we gotta abort this!

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.270
- Abort, abort!
- Hold on, hold on! I see something up here!

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:30.354
We got a man on the move.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.148
No, Officer, we're aborting this now!

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.359
Not yet, God damn it, we got action!

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:37.694
You don't see what I see, G!
Just keep them busy!

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.118
What's this crazy son of a bitch doing?

01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:48.872
Hey!

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:54.045
Shit! He just jacked a guard!

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:56.464
Open this door!

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.133
We got a vehicular, people!

01:08:58.216 --> 01:08:59.591
He in the truck!

01:09:01.886 --> 01:09:03.888
Crazy son of a bitch is going for it!

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.224
He hit the car!

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:09.560
Keep it clear down below, boys!

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:12.897
- Shit, man, here he come!
- Here he comes, here he comes!

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:18.903
<i>He's ramming the truck!</i>

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.740
<i>- Here it come!</i>
- Get out of the way!

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:29.455
That's what I'm talking about! Damn!

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.875
- Get the jaws, get the jaws!
- Keep them back!

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.964
Shit! Little bastard!

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.884
Soldier boy done lost his damn mind!

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:52.437
Shit! What's he doing?

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.104
Our man got a problem here.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:57.984
Hit the guard!

01:10:00.946 --> 01:10:02.363
Incoming!

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:07.702
Hell, yeah.

01:10:08.412 --> 01:10:09.495
Take his shit!

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:15.668
I've got you, man. Come on. Got you.

01:10:24.511 --> 01:10:25.511
We got it.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.015
<i>All units, 211 on an armored vehicle,</i>
<i>4th and Olive.</i>

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:32.560
<i>Repeat, armored vehicle robbery</i>
<i>in progress, 4th and Olive.</i>

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.520
4th and Olive. That's them.

01:10:36.523 --> 01:10:37.774
Turn the car around.

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:40.151
I'm taking you home, Eddie.

01:10:41.278 --> 01:10:43.780
Come on, turn the car around.
It's a couple blocks away.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.368
- No, man.
- God damn it, man, I'm still a cop!

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:49.577
Turn the car around!

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:52.705
All right.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.173
Let's hustle, boys, come on!

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.092
Yeah!

01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:06.219
- Come on!
- Come on, Jake!

01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:07.428
Go, go, go, go!

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.641
Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:20.692
Move it, move it!

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:36.791
Look at this.

01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:40.253
Took a shitload of explosives to do this.

01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:41.629
- C-4.
- Yeah.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.923
- What do you got?
- We got two down in the hole.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.175
Guard got a look at one of them.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.219
Caucasian male, adult, in his 30s.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.346
I got a sketch artist coming here now
to work with our witness.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:51.889
Jesus Christ.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:55.101
They're long gone!
Sewer tunnels in every direction.

01:11:55.185 --> 01:11:56.227
Sewer tunnels?

01:11:57.062 --> 01:12:00.356
Remember that public works map
we found at the Russian safe house?

01:12:00.524 --> 01:12:05.653
The burnt fragment? The sewers, explosives.
High-powered weapons.

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.155
So the job went down
without our two dead guys?

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:10.074
Yeah, well, you remember the map?
There was a subway map at the Russians.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.826
Yeah, you think the sewers
connect to the subway station?

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:13.369
Could be, let's check it out.

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:15.955
- What was the closest station circled?
- Pershing Square.

01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:43.566
Pardon me.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:52.200
That's him, Hatch! The guy with the gray hat!
From the hot-dog stand!

01:12:52.284 --> 01:12:53.618
- Shit!
- Freeze!

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.037
- We have a runner!
- Stop!

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:02.335
Asshole!

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.463
Get out the way, get out the way!

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:06.631
Look out! Look out!

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.717
- Are you crazy?
- Shit!

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:23.648
You all right? Hey! Where you going, pal?

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:25.983
We're in pursuit!

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.568
Headed toward Pershing Square.

01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:37.745
He's headed through the park!

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:19.036
Move. Move. Move.

01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.416
Get off my car! Hey!

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:38.639
He just left Grand!
He's headed towards the library!

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.284
Yeah, man.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:03.915
Shit!

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:06.083
Police! Freeze!

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.154
Move!

01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:39.992
Move, move, move, move! Get out the way!

01:15:42.996 --> 01:15:44.247
Police! Watch out!

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.331
- Which way did he go?
- Back there.

01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:46.415
- Can we exit this way?
- No.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.543
- Get out of the way!
- Cover those doors!

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:50.419
- Move, move, move!
- He went that way.

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:52.213
- He went that way.
- Down the hall.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.260
Hey!

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:05.726
Move it!

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:08.020
Hey, hey!

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.996
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.414
Everybody, out!

01:17:15.672 --> 01:17:16.881
Come on, Jesse.

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:38.235
Hatch?

01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:40.321
Hatch!

01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:43.741
Shit!

01:17:48.121 --> 01:17:52.625
Hold on, buddy. Just hold on. Jesus.

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:55.670
- The son of a bitch was fast.
- This is unit 14.

01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:58.631
I got an officer down.
Sixth floor, Monroe building.

01:17:58.715 --> 01:18:00.257
I need immediate assistance.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.055
Freeze!

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:20.986
He's outside!

01:18:29.287 --> 01:18:31.997
Come on, come on.
Just keep breathing, buddy.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:34.333
Keep breathing. Come on, stay with me.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.850
I need that crash unit fast! Now!

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:52.643
Come on, buddy. Hang in there.

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:06.657
We lost him!

01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:10.828
Line of duty, Jack. Line of duty.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.788
Yeah, come on. Come on.
You just keep breathing.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:15.040
You gotta make it, man. Come on.
Look at me, look at me.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:20.504
My family, man. Monica.
You take care of Eddie.

01:19:21.047 --> 01:19:22.840
I'm gonna take care of your family.
Don't worry about that.

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:25.259
They're gonna be taken care of.
You just keep breathing.

01:19:25.343 --> 01:19:27.261
- Come on.
- Tell Monica I love her.

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:30.097
- I will.
- Tell her I love her.

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:33.309
Come on, buddy. Hang in there.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.329
It's me.

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:59.251
I know who it is. I watch news.
You think I'm stupid, you punk bitch?

01:19:59.377 --> 01:20:03.964
Hey, cool it, brother.
I sense a little too much hostility.

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:05.716
I was just trying to make everybody...

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.969
I give you dispatcher, and you do job
with somebody else!

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:10.638
Two of my men dead. I kill you!

01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:14.183
You do not wanna kill me. If I'm dead,
how am I gonna get you half the money?

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:16.894
You do want the money, don't you?

01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:20.648
<i>You listening now? Thought so.</i>

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:26.904
Hey, we meeting at the Roosevelt Hotel.
I'm gonna convince them to give you half.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.240
<i>I'll call you later with the room number.</i>

01:20:46.883 --> 01:20:50.594
We're all real sorry, Jack.
I just spoke with his wife.

01:20:53.765 --> 01:20:57.309
What about the surveillance tape?
His family?

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:00.271
Forget the tape.
He was killed in the line of duty.

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.314
He'll get a cop's burial and full benefits.

01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:04.775
Good. Thanks.

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:12.408
You were making headway
with FedCal Bank. Was it them?

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:16.120
I don't know.
Guy started running, we chased him.

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:21.000
Eddie got shot. I got nothing.

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:27.172
You okay, Jack?

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.634
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:46.984
- Jake? You heard from Jesse?
- No, not yet.

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:50.321
$19.3 million, so far.
Easily the biggest lick yet, gentlemen.

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:52.823
<i>Witnesses report...</i>

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.909
I can feel it, man. Something's not right.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:58.329
This is my fault, man.
I should've never brought him in.

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:00.164
- Hey, Ghost?
- Yes, sir?

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:04.043
Yeah.

01:22:05.128 --> 01:22:07.171
That's the account card for the '04 job.

01:22:09.549 --> 01:22:11.467
That's $250,000 for the Russians.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.094
That puts us even now, Ghost.

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:16.555
Say what, Rahway?

01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:18.390
You heard me. That puts us even.

01:22:18.683 --> 01:22:22.978
Yeah, a'ight. My plan, your command.

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:26.065
I knew I could trust y'all.

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:34.365
Who is it?

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:38.410
It's him. Where you been? I been calling you!

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:40.245
- Police chased me.
- Police? Where?

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:42.456
You brought them here?
Jesse, you brought them here?

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:43.582
No. I shot one of them.

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:44.667
- What?
- What?

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.919
- Hold on! You shot a cop?
- I had to, man.

01:22:47.003 --> 01:22:48.212
- Where the money?
- I stashed it.

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:50.130
- You left the money? Damn!
- Goddamn!

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:52.967
Stashed it? Hold, hold on! Everyone,
hold on. What happened, Jesse? Talk to me.

01:22:53.718 --> 01:22:55.511
At the subway station, there was two cops.

01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:58.180
And they just started chasing me.

01:22:58.264 --> 01:23:00.641
And they chased you
out the crowd because of what?

01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:01.767
How, how the hell am I supposed to know?

01:23:01.851 --> 01:23:03.811
- Why?
- Ghost. Hold on.

01:23:03.895 --> 01:23:05.104
- Hold on! Hold on!
- No, man, let him tell me why!

01:23:05.188 --> 01:23:06.897
- So, what happened? You shot because?
- I don't know!

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.357
- I had to. He had me...
- Why'd you shoot him?

01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:09.733
'Cause you stupid.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.986
I had no choice!
He had me. He had me cold, man.

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:15.698
But he never fired at me.
It was... It was kind of like...

01:23:15.782 --> 01:23:16.991
Like what?

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:18.867
Like he wanted me to shoot him.

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:20.953
Stupid ass!

01:23:21.913 --> 01:23:23.998
Shit! I'll beat the shit out of you.

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.499
- G! G! Wait!
- Let him go! Let him go!

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:26.583
Get off me! Yo, cool it.
Get your hands off me!

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:28.210
- Back off! Back off!
- You understand what you just did?

01:23:28.294 --> 01:23:29.795
- It wasn't my fault!
- You don't shoot cops!

01:23:29.879 --> 01:23:30.921
I'll deal with it! Let him go!

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.089
You deal with it then, Jake!

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.842
That's a death sentence, young blood,
and I ain't going with you.

01:23:34.926 --> 01:23:36.260
Nice one, Jesse.

01:23:56.114 --> 01:23:57.406
Still taking passengers tonight?

01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:59.366
Van Nuys Airport, 8:30.

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:03.495
Look, with everything that happened
today, nothing personal,

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.539
I'll take care of your finances
and then I'm out.

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:08.125
- Okay.
- Fair enough.

01:24:11.671 --> 01:24:14.381
<i>I'm standing about a block away</i>
<i>from the Monroe office building</i>

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:16.050
<i>in downtown Los Angeles</i>

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:20.429
<i>where an LAPD detective</i>
<i>was shot and killed about an hour ago.</i>

01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:27.728
Right on time.

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:30.147
<i>Witnesses describe...</i>

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:33.400
So, Jesse, how'd it feel
losing that money, shooting that cop?

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:35.069
- Ghost. Easy.
- What?

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:36.653
<i>Now, we can't confirm,</i>
<i>at this hour, but the suspect...</i>

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:38.572
Ghost, we ain't gotta act
like we friends anymore, do we?

01:24:38.656 --> 01:24:41.450
Hey, business is business. Money is money.

01:24:41.534 --> 01:24:42.910
I never said we were friends.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:46.121
- Now, me and Lilli, however.
- Come here! You wanna...

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:49.041
Hey! Take it easy! Hey, Jake, Jake, Jake!

01:24:49.125 --> 01:24:52.002
Hey, come on, take it easy!
He's not worth it, all right?

01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:55.214
All right, let's get the fellas
and get out of here.

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.228
I'm here. Which room?

01:25:09.312 --> 01:25:12.689
1116. A'ight.

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:25.202
<i>Hey, Welles, where you at? You got a 20?</i>

01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:29.248
Come on, man, I know you're out there.
Pick up.

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:32.376
<i>We're worried about you. Where you...</i>

01:25:35.755 --> 01:25:37.840
All right, fellas, we're good.
We're out of here.

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:40.676
So, here's the deal.
Anyone wants to fly with...

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.678
- Where's Ghost?
- In the bathroom.

01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:43.762
Get Ghost for me.

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:46.765
Tonight, Scott, 8:30, Van Nuys Airport,
all right?

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.809
Plane's ready. Bring your passports,
your bags, and your guns.

01:25:48.893 --> 01:25:50.269
Ghost? Hey!

01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:52.312
If you need anything,
make sure you give us a call.

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:54.398
What's he doing, taking a shower?
What's going on in here?

01:25:55.108 --> 01:25:57.234
- What was that?
- Shower's on.

01:25:58.027 --> 01:25:59.153
Hey, he's gone!

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:01.113
- I told you! I told you!
- What?

01:26:01.197 --> 01:26:02.197
- I don't know about this.
- Damn!

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:03.323
- What are you talking about?
- Where'd he go?

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:04.366
- I knew this was a bad idea!
- Damn it!

01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:05.617
Let's get out of here, let's get out.

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.411
Oh, shit!

01:26:34.772 --> 01:26:36.023
Take out the automatic!

01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:40.194
Jesse!

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.792
Hey, Jake, you okay?

01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:02.549
Get up, man, get up! Come on, buddy!
Come on, man, come on!

01:27:03.134 --> 01:27:05.344
- Out the back!
- Jesse, Jake, let's go!

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:12.392
Come on, let's go!

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:14.811
Go. I'm coming.

01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:23.195
Go!

01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:26.448
Come on, come on!

01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:01.191
Where's A. J? Where's A. J? Where's...

01:28:11.494 --> 01:28:12.995
Down, get down!

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:20.460
- Shit! Who are these guys?
- Sounds like Russians!

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.425
Jake! Check the hallway.

01:28:26.509 --> 01:28:28.218
Let's put these beds up, let's go!

01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:48.864
We got a shotgun in the hallway!

01:29:09.635 --> 01:29:11.303
Stay low, stay low!

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:21.021
Shit! I'm out of ammo! I'm out, I'm out!

01:29:21.105 --> 01:29:22.606
Where's Jake?

01:30:27.046 --> 01:30:31.341
We gotta go, fellas. We gotta go.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.945
Ghost set us up against the Russians.

01:30:52.029 --> 01:30:54.739
Son of a bitch, he must've sold them
on the same plan.

01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:55.949
That's why they gave him the dispatcher

01:30:56.033 --> 01:30:57.826
and that big hurry-up
was just to get us to do the job first.

01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:00.036
- Yeah, and we bought it.
- Yeah, all of it.

01:31:01.038 --> 01:31:02.747
Shit, the heat's gonna be coming down now.

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:05.917
I know. See you at the airport.

01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:23.852
Lilli? Lilli?

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:42.245
Hold on, baby. Oh, God, baby, get up. Baby.

01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:49.085
Oh, my God, baby, wake up. Oh, just...

01:31:51.422 --> 01:31:53.006
Goddamn, the money's gone!

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:55.926
Jesse, help me! Help me!

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:12.275
Ghost. Ghost, I'm gonna kill you. Oh, God.

01:32:16.447 --> 01:32:17.948
Jake, we got company.

01:32:21.118 --> 01:32:24.454
Jake, we gotta go. We have to go.

01:32:26.832 --> 01:32:31.002
Oh, God. Ghost.

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:10.542
<i>Los Angeles Police Department.</i>
<i>Exit the building slowly.</i>

01:33:10.626 --> 01:33:12.544
<i>You have 20 seconds to come out.</i>

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.353
Look, Jake. I was wrong about Ghost.

01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:33.898
I'm sorry, man.

01:33:34.483 --> 01:33:36.026
It's not your fault.

01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:47.329
Jesse, you ain't gotta be down with me
on this one.

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:50.540
You got your own life to think about, man.

01:33:52.168 --> 01:33:54.377
I already told you. I'm never going back.

01:33:55.671 --> 01:33:57.255
And this is my life.

01:33:59.675 --> 01:34:01.426
My car's out back. Where's yours?

01:34:03.346 --> 01:34:04.804
In front.

01:34:07.224 --> 01:34:08.391
Let's take yours.

01:34:09.226 --> 01:34:10.352
Thought you'd say that.

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:13.605
You ready, bro?

01:34:16.942 --> 01:34:20.612
Just me and you, big brother. Let's go.

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:00.754
- Naomi.
- G!

01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:02.589
- What are you doing? Come here.
- G!

01:36:02.673 --> 01:36:04.466
What are you doing? Are you all right?

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:07.260
- They won't let me in your building.
- We've gotta go.

01:36:07.344 --> 01:36:09.095
Come on, let's get in the car. All right.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.680
- Just wanna go home.
- All right.

01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:59.062
There you are.

01:37:03.943 --> 01:37:05.819
- Talk to me.
- I'm almost to the airport.

01:37:05.903 --> 01:37:06.903
Yeah, me, too.

01:37:07.029 --> 01:37:08.822
Hey, I'm tripping.
Hear me out right quick, all right?

01:37:08.906 --> 01:37:10.240
Yeah, what's up?

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:11.658
Ghost has had the jump on us
from the get-go, right?

01:37:11.742 --> 01:37:13.576
So, why would he take us all out

01:37:14.745 --> 01:37:16.788
and then only settle for the cash
from the '04 job?

01:37:17.206 --> 01:37:19.541
- He wouldn't.
- Unless...

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:23.044
- Man, he plans on taking all the money.
- Shit, Scott. Scott has all the money.

01:37:23.128 --> 01:37:25.088
Exactly. I'm on my way. I'm right behind you.

01:37:30.427 --> 01:37:33.555
I know this is a little last-minute.
Have him meet me at the bank.

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:40.270
Come on, Scott, pick up. Scott, pick up.

01:37:40.563 --> 01:37:42.021
Yeah, I'm coming in tonight.

01:37:42.106 --> 01:37:44.732
You have to make yourself available
at 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow, all right?

01:37:44.817 --> 01:37:46.192
Can you do that?

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:47.610
<i>You've reached Scott. I'm away from my cell.</i>

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.196
Oh, God. No, Scott, pick up. Damn it.

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:54.576
All right.

01:37:57.037 --> 01:37:58.663
Okay. Let's get out of here.

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:04.794
It's been a long day.
Can you pour me a Scotch?

01:38:26.317 --> 01:38:30.528
Yeah, where are you going? You just
had to have it all, didn't you, Ghost?

01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:32.822
- I'm just taking what's mine!
- Oh, yeah?

01:38:33.324 --> 01:38:34.782
I should've shot you on the street today.

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:37.410
Naw, you should've shot me five years ago
on that fire escape.

01:38:37.494 --> 01:38:40.038
You got caught, Ghost! You got caught!

01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:42.165
You knew the game
when you was playing it!

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:44.292
You left me back there to die like I was shit!

01:38:44.376 --> 01:38:45.501
You ain't shit, Ghost!

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:47.045
I helped you put this crew together!

01:38:47.129 --> 01:38:49.088
So what? Now you wanna take it apart?

01:38:49.173 --> 01:38:52.342
Drop the weapon! Drop it! Police!
Put them down!

01:38:53.344 --> 01:38:55.053
- Put them down!
- Stay out of this!

01:38:55.137 --> 01:38:56.763
- Better listen to him, cop.
- It's between me and him.

01:38:56.847 --> 01:38:59.098
If you interfere, I'm gonna kill you, too.

01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:01.017
- Last time, drop them!
- Shit.

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:16.032
What you expect me to do, G? Huh?

01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:21.079
You took my money. Took my bitch from me.

01:39:21.163 --> 01:39:23.039
Just put me out the crew, huh?

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:28.211
What you thought I was gonna do?
Let that shit go?

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:29.420
You got caught!

01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:33.967
Yeah. A'ight. I see now.

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:36.636
It's all business for you.

01:39:37.846 --> 01:39:39.722
Well, this shit just got real personal.

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:55.571
- Should've waited for me, G.
- The shit went too fast.

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:57.031
Hold, hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:39:57.116 --> 01:39:59.826
Don't move! Don't you move!

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:13.423
You're that cop with the little girl.

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:16.801
You should've stayed out of this.

01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.888
- Let's get that money and get out of here.
- Yeah.

01:40:53.964 --> 01:40:56.007
<i>Emergency dispatch.</i>

01:40:56.091 --> 01:40:57.800
Yeah.

01:40:57.885 --> 01:41:03.639
You got an officer down.
Van Nuys Airport, hangar 12.

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:08.394
I've been shot and I need help.

01:41:09.146 --> 01:41:10.480
<i>Units en route.</i>

01:41:12.691 --> 01:41:13.775
I want help.

01:41:24.995 --> 01:41:27.622
G? Are we going home now?

01:41:30.626 --> 01:41:35.171
Yeah, baby. We're going home.

01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:39.383
Are we good, brother?

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.346
All signs point to it.
