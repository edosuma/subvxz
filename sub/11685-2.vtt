WEBVTT

00:03.560 --> 00:05.560
We're pretty sure
there's only two users.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.560
One person is posting a target
for the other,

00:07.600 --> 00:10.520
and the other one's committing
the murder. They're playing a game.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.160
A man running a few streets away
at the time of the murder.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.480
Witness name and address?
He wouldn't give it.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.000
Is there any connection
with our victims' profiles?

00:18.040 --> 00:20.040
Michael Edgerton,
no previous offences.

00:20.080 --> 00:24.080
There's a Mark Winston who was
murdered at a Neo-Nazi rally.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.760
Look at Jenna Mawson's face.
That girl is out there.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.520
Get off me, please!
Calm down.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.200
We've got reason
to believe you're in danger.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.040
They're taking Taisie's case
further. We're arresting you

00:34.080 --> 00:37.320
for possession and distribution
of indecent images of a minor.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.160
We've got a leak.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.280
A blog has posted details
of our suspects.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.560
STOP!
Kenny Medford and Steve Dench.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.920
I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.880
We've just found a body
of a teenager in Victoria Park.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.200
He was nominated on the website.
Then his death's our fault.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.040 --> 01:43.480
What's happened?
Hi, Gina.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.000
Where's Ian?
Shall we go inside?

01:46.040 --> 01:49.560
He's not been answering his phone.
Come on, let's go inside.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.640
Where is he, Janet? Where's Ian?

01:54.680 --> 01:57.520
Mitch!
Get them girls out of here now!

01:57.560 --> 02:00.960
All right. Come on, girls. You
shouldn't be here.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.760
That leak is costing lives.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.360
If it wasn't for all the hoax
postings on the website,

02:15.400 --> 02:17.760
we could have protected him.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.800
Yeah?
'Rachel,

02:23.840 --> 02:25.840
the malware we've got on the website

02:25.880 --> 02:28.400
has tracked whoever
nominated your boy in the park.'

02:29.400 --> 02:32.960
Yeah. What time was it posted?
'Yesterday at 9:18am.'

02:33.000 --> 02:37.440
Steve was released at 8:30am yesterday and Kenny
Medford wasn't arrested till the afternoon,

02:37.480 --> 02:39.200
so either could've posted it.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.520
'The user's located
somewhere in the Failsworth area.'

02:42.560 --> 02:44.240
Where Steve lives.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.120
So we could have him.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.040
When whoever killed Will Hudson
brags about it on the internet,

02:49.080 --> 02:50.880
we'll have him as well.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.880
I'll get a court order,
make sure we get that exact address.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.120
'Is it true that you failed to
notify the victim and his family

03:00.160 --> 03:03.280
that he was in danger?'
'No comment. Next question.'

03:03.320 --> 03:05.160
Ooh! Godzuki didn't like that.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.920
You sure you haven't picked up
my daybook by mistake?

03:07.960 --> 03:10.880
No, mate.
Would you mind checking again?

03:10.920 --> 03:13.720
When did you last have it?
This morning.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.840
Give us a sec.
Let me finish this.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.960
'..reports that it was
local teenager Will Hudson.'

03:19.000 --> 03:21.920
'We haven't officially identified
the victim.'

03:21.960 --> 03:24.960
'And out of common decency, I would
urge you not to speculate...'

03:26.320 --> 03:28.480
Mitch, Will Hudson's parents
are downstairs

03:28.520 --> 03:31.320
ready for identification.
I want you as FLO.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.960
'What can you tell us about
how the victims were murdered?'

03:34.000 --> 03:38.840
Get some work done, Pete. I want to know where Steve
Dench was at the time of Will Hudson's death.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.160
'..most vulnerable
members of our community,

03:41.200 --> 03:43.920
and we are doing everything
in our power

03:43.960 --> 03:48.360
to bring these craven, spineless
murderers to justice.'

03:55.040 --> 03:57.920
Janet?
We're going to take her down now.

04:25.800 --> 04:30.200
We've got an officer there. Someone
will be there 24 hours a day.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.720
If you want to go somewhere,
they'll go with you.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.120
Are you all right?

04:37.120 --> 04:39.160
Why are people doing this to me?

04:39.200 --> 04:41.760
We'll find out and we'll stop them.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.000
I've done nothing wrong.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.320
Hey, we've got you.
You're gonna be safe.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.560
Can you tell us about the nature
of your relationship with Sam?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.920
Relationship? They were just kids.

05:04.960 --> 05:09.000
In your role as appropriate adult,
you're not permitted to comment.

05:11.560 --> 05:14.080
What would you say if I told you
that we have pictures

05:14.120 --> 05:17.840
that suggest the relationship
was of a sexual nature?

05:18.440 --> 05:22.840
For the film, I am showing Taisie
exhibit MH1,

05:22.880 --> 05:28.400
which is a picture taken using
her phone, of Sam's erect penis.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.280
Shh-shh. It's OK.

05:32.320 --> 05:36.720
For the film, I am now
showing Taisie MH2,

05:36.760 --> 05:41.120
an image of Taisie
touching Sam's erect penis.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.760
Has anybody heard from Janet?

05:44.560 --> 05:46.600
OK. Steve Dench's alibi?

05:48.120 --> 05:50.280
He was at home in Failsworth
being bail checked.

05:50.320 --> 05:54.520
There's no way he could have got to
the park and back in ti.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.360
Where are we with the internet service
provider? Have we got the Failsworth address?

05:58.400 --> 06:02.040
They've received the court order. It
could take up to 24 hours.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.640
We need to go back in
with Kenny Medford.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.280
How did you get on with his ex?

06:07.320 --> 06:09.800
Oh, ah - Carrie said he...

06:09.840 --> 06:13.000
Turned up on the doorstep a couple
of days ago, said he was in trouble.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.760
He owed a lot of money
to some people.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.320
He was so scared,
I had to help him.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.320
So she hid him.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.480
Did you believe her?
Do we believe anybody?

06:23.360 --> 06:26.000
Run a credit check on them
both, see how in debt they are.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.040
We know Kenny didn't murder Will
Hudson. He was locked up in here.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.240
It's too early to rule him out
of the others.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.320
Carrie has given Kenny an alibi
for Michael Edgerton's murder.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.040
How reliable she is, I don't know.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.600
All the information she's give us
is vague, evasive.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.520
We tried to find his whereabouts
at the time of the other murders.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.440
She can't confirm any dates.
Did you try his employer?

06:44.480 --> 06:46.480
She said
he's been unemployed for ages

06:46.520 --> 06:48.760
and before that he mainly
worked cash in hand.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.520
Connections
between suspects and victims?

06:51.560 --> 06:53.480
Pete?
Yeah, along with everything else.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.000
We need more people on it. We need
more people and we need more time.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.040
The interviews alone
are crippling us.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.160
Families, friends, colleagues,
neighbours, across seven years.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.240
Times by two suspects,
times by ten victims.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.560
And increasing all the time.
It's what we do.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.840
This is the job.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.600
We've got Kenny
once living near Jenna.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.240
Apart from that we've got nothing

07:15.280 --> 07:17.920
that physically links Steve or Kenny
to any of the murders

07:17.960 --> 07:20.040
on their side of the board.
So think smarter.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.760
Don't look for connections
between the murderer and the victim,

07:23.800 --> 07:25.400
because there won't be one. Look -

07:28.600 --> 07:31.880
Oh, boo-hoo! We're all overworked,

07:31.920 --> 07:34.600
but we've still got time
for a Mickey Mouse dick-about.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.960
Excuse me, Rachel.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.920
Can I have an update in your office
when you're ready?

07:42.920 --> 07:44.680
Grow up!

07:46.320 --> 07:49.040
Two killers.
Different murder styles.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.920
Different metadata
on the images they post.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.120
So we've got a good idea how the
murders are split between the two.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.240
We're working on the premise that
the person who nominates the victim

07:58.280 --> 08:00.520
is the one with the connection,
not the killer.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.920
Even if they're picking
totally at random,

08:03.960 --> 08:06.840
they have to know someone exists,
in order to choose them.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.200
You see what I mean?
However tenuous the link -

08:09.240 --> 08:11.280
pushed past in a queue,
road rage -

08:11.320 --> 08:14.320
there has to be
some sort of connection. Mm.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.480
Raise it at tomorrow's Gold meeting.
It's diaried for midday.

08:22.360 --> 08:26.160
The blood sample found in Kenny's
car has been confirmed as Kenny's.

08:26.200 --> 08:31.080
Right, I want Kenny released on
bail. Newspapers are sniffin.

08:31.120 --> 08:35.320
If they print it, it'll degrade our
chances of a charge. I.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.039
He's had days to do a runner and
he's got as far as the st.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.240
We've got his car, passport.
He knows we're watching him.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.680
And I want you
to visit Will Hudson's parents.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.320
I need someone with the punch

08:46.360 --> 08:49.080
to assure them we're carrying out
a robust investigation.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.640
Which we are.
Mm.

09:01.640 --> 09:06.120
'Hello, Ultrasound.' I need to reschedule
an appointment for my ultrasound tomo.

09:06.160 --> 09:09.040
'Thanks for letting us know. Could I
have your name, please?'

09:09.080 --> 09:12.920
Yeah, it's DS - I mean, Rachel
Bailey.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.800
'I'll just check the system.'
I'm really sorry.

09:15.840 --> 09:20.000
I've cancelled twice already.
'There's another appointment booked.'

09:20.040 --> 09:23.280
Why didn't you do anything to stop
them saying those things to me?

09:23.320 --> 09:26.320
It was you in that car.
You taking those pictures.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.480
Nice try,
but this isn't about my mistakes.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.640
You spend all your time
helping everyone else.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.880
What about me?
You should've helped me.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.240
You didn't do anything.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.320
She's right, I didn't. I haven't.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.840
'How could you?
You're dealing with procedures

09:44.880 --> 09:48.880
designed for scrotes and psychopaths,
not a kid with a camera phone.'

09:48.920 --> 09:51.440
Why is nobody using
common sense and stopping this?

09:51.480 --> 09:53.240
'I could've stopped it.'

09:53.280 --> 09:55.480
Sam's mum left a message
a couple of weeks ago.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.080
She was worried about
Sam and Taisie's relationship.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.760
She thought it was going a bit fast.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.240
I didn't get back to her. I forgot.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.600
No, that's a lie. I didn't forget.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.200
I was busy.
I didn't think it was important.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.240
I need to do something about this.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.720
No. You can't get involved.
You're a police officer.

10:16.760 --> 10:20.280
'I'm Taisie's mum first.'
Put them there.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.000
'Sorry, you haven't got time.'
Course I have.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.680
Well, I haven't. I should be
sorting this and I'm not.

10:25.720 --> 10:29.080
I'm telling you, any other mother
would be round at Sam's mum's house.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.960
You don't get
to act like any other mum.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.840
Why? Because I'm a cop?

10:39.640 --> 10:44.120
He did so much for charity.
It was all over the local papers.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.360
Did Will get any negative attention
from this?

10:49.400 --> 10:54.320
We took his Twitter account down
after some unpleasant posts.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.560
We've made sure only friends can
post on the other sites he used,

10:57.600 --> 11:02.840
just in case anyone thinks it's
funny to post stuff now he's dead.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.960
Is there anything else
you'd like us to do?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.440
Have you got kids?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.080
Hm. That's a shame.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.880
That's what you can do for me.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.880
Have a child
and live to see him die.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.040
As soon as our house appeared
on that website,

11:26.080 --> 11:30.360
you knew he could be in danger,
you knew what could happen,

11:30.400 --> 11:32.600
and you did nothing.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.040
I lost my daybook.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.160
Well, hurry up. I'll wait for you.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.720
I think that's what caused the leak.
I know I should've said right away.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.840
I haven't slept for days.
Days?

11:58.880 --> 12:01.440
Don't say days!

12:01.480 --> 12:03.600
When, exactly?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.040
The day before yesterday.
Shit, Mitch!

12:06.080 --> 12:08.360
And you're just telling me this now?

12:09.160 --> 12:12.360
Well, rewind. I don't want
to hear it. This is all yours.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.640
What am I supposed to do?
Ring Dodson?

12:16.680 --> 12:19.520
I don't know.
So you do think I've got an option?

12:19.560 --> 12:21.240
We could be talking dismissal.

12:21.280 --> 12:24.680
Criminal charges.
This led to someone's death.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.680
How d'you know the press leak
came from you?

12:29.720 --> 12:32.640
All the info the press printed
was in my daybook when I lost it.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.720
Who else have you told?
Janet.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.160
So you've incriminated two people
in your twattish behaviour already?

12:39.200 --> 12:42.200
I'll go to Dodson if you want. I
won't say I've said anything to you.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.880
Too right you won't.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.720
I feel for you, Mitch, but if this
goes tits up I'm not touching it.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.640
The press are gunning for me.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.040
If there is any chance
this leak isn't down to you,

12:51.080 --> 12:53.600
grab it. Turn your house over.
Tear the station apart.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.320
Don't stop until you've found it.
And if I can't?

12:56.360 --> 12:58.360
You come clean.
Leave me and Janet out of it.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.120
You amateur bastard!

13:14.440 --> 13:17.520
What is it with these pictures?
I worry about her.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.200
Is it normal?

13:19.240 --> 13:21.680
Is that what they all do now?
I think it is.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.120
I don't know if that makes me
feel better or worse.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.200
Well, when she's the only one
arrested for it,

13:26.240 --> 13:27.920
it makes me feel worse.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.360
They're making an example of her
because of my job.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.760
After all you've done for them.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.960
You've risked your life for them
how many times?

13:37.000 --> 13:41.760
You'd think they'd stand by you
over this one stupid thing.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.320
It's not a loyalty card,

13:44.360 --> 13:47.560
arrest five murderers
and you get a sex crime free.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.840
Don't the police have anything
better to do? Nope, nothing.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.960
That's right, be flippant.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.640
What's Rachel doing in all this?
I wondered how long it would be

13:56.680 --> 13:58.280
before she got the blame.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.800
How's Rachel going to do anything?

14:00.840 --> 14:04.400
No, you're right. I bet she's been
nowhere to be seen in all of this.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.280
Gill wouldn't have let this happen.
What would Gill have done?

14:07.320 --> 14:09.560
Used her superpowers
to turn back time

14:09.600 --> 14:11.920
to when teenagers
didn't touch one another?

14:11.960 --> 14:14.120
It's not just about you and Taisie.

14:14.160 --> 14:18.080
I used that computer
they've confiscated.

14:18.120 --> 14:22.240
I can't bear the thought of your
workmates looking through that.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.840
Why? What have you been doing on it?

14:24.880 --> 14:27.040
Nothing you haven't used it for!

14:27.080 --> 14:30.360
It feels like they're
rifling through my knicker drawer.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.200
I know, Mum.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.440
I have to say you seem very relaxed
about all of this.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.640
Do I? Trust me, I'm not.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.160
Look, I've got to go.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.920
Tell her I love her and then duck.

14:45.880 --> 14:49.880
And she's not allowed out, Mum, OK?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.440
What are you doing sleeping there?

15:04.480 --> 15:06.160
I waited for you to come to bed.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.200
That's why I'm sleeping in here.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.680
Don't.
What? I haven't said owt.

15:12.720 --> 15:17.520
If you want that baby to come out
with an iron lung, you carry on.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.520
How far gone are you?
Four months.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.560
Does the dad know?

15:24.600 --> 15:26.240
Do you know the dad?

15:26.760 --> 15:30.800
Four months?
Why are you still doing pee-sticks?

15:30.840 --> 15:33.040
To see if it's still there.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.120
Is he, is he from London?

15:36.160 --> 15:41.040
If you must know, he was the love of my life.
He died in a terrorist attack last month.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.080
Oh, my God.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.120
Oh, pack it in!
Hurry up!

15:46.160 --> 15:47.760
Whose is it?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.640
I only just got in!
I don't care. Get out.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.800
Calm down! She's only been a minute.
I'm trying to sleep!

15:52.840 --> 15:56.280
You'll be trying to remove my shoe
from your arse if you shout again.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.040
Don't take it out on him.
Take what out on who?

15:59.080 --> 16:01.680
I swear, you don't even know
when you're being horrible.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.680
I'd put it down to your hormones,

16:03.720 --> 16:05.760
but you've not been pregnant
the last 20 years.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.720
Why are you following me everywhere?

16:07.760 --> 16:10.560
Because we need to talk...

16:10.600 --> 16:14.000
Rachel, this is
going to change your life.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.560
And I know you probably think
it's ruined mine.

16:16.600 --> 16:21.920
And you're right, bits of it has,
but mostly it's brilliant.

16:21.960 --> 16:25.560
I had some average sex with an
all-right bloke and now I'm pregnant.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.920
I know your kids
are the centre of your universe.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.400
It's free!
And they really are lovely.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.320
I'm just not bothered about
having my own one way or the other.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.960
If it happens,
or if I decide to let it happen,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I will let you know.
Until then, shall we just drop it?

16:47.800 --> 16:50.160
'Ahh!'

16:56.720 --> 16:59.200
What did
our forensic psychologist say?

16:59.240 --> 17:02.040
These acts have been incredibly
private and secret in the past.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.680
Sending this isn't some idle whim.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.200
This is someone taking control,
giving us these images.

17:08.240 --> 17:11.800
Is the fact it was sent to you
directly significant? Possibl.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.480
She couldn't say definitively.

17:13.520 --> 17:17.760
You have to remember, in their minds
these guys were playing nicely.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.720
Playing this game in the dark,
unseen,

17:20.760 --> 17:24.560
in a very emotionally
intimate relationship.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.760
You come along and rip the bedsheets
off. You ruin it.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.040
This lot have created a fantasy
world in their heads

17:31.080 --> 17:35.760
where they think they're superhuman,
the elite, above us all.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.680
And that is so important to them.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.640
Then you go on national television
and call them spineless.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.400
No wonder he sees you
as a direct point of contact.

17:43.440 --> 17:47.760
Maybe that's why he sent the video
of Will Hudson's murder to you.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.880
Or he knew we'd try to trace him
through the website. Mm.</.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.640
Will Hudson isn't like
the other victims,

17:53.680 --> 17:58.480
some "invisible". He's known, he's
proper pull-at-your-heart-strings.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.200
Does that mean the rules of the game
have changed?

18:01.240 --> 18:05.320
Maybe he chose someone
that he knew would get attention.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.360
Is he trying to make us,
you, look bad?

18:07.400 --> 18:10.360
If he's changing his patterns
and making contact with you,

18:10.400 --> 18:13.120
I'm worried about the implications
for your safety.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.840
Did Rae think
you could be in danger?

18:14.880 --> 18:17.040
Come in.

18:17.840 --> 18:22.200
The internet service provider's given us
the address of the person.

18:22.240 --> 18:26.200
Is it Steve Dench?
Finley Macawley, 236 Halton Mews.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.400
Police!
Armed police!

18:48.240 --> 18:51.880
I was told to post the picture of
Will Hudson by someone on Twitter.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.440
I've never met him.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.400
All I know is that his Twitter
name was Scareit4me.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.360
'He DM'd me after I trolled
Will Hudson's charity site.'

19:00.400 --> 19:03.440
He told me to post the picture
on the Taking Out The Trash website.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.040
For a laugh?

19:09.080 --> 19:12.280
Finlay's not connected.
He's just a Twitter troll.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.000
I thought they had more pink
sticky-up hair than that.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.640
His day nurse said
he barely leaves the house.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.280
The Twitter account
used to contact Finlay's a dead end,

19:20.320 --> 19:23.520
but the username's similar to the
email address sending you the video.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.440
We need to scan online to see if
that username appears anywhere else.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.880
That shouldn't take long.

19:30.920 --> 19:35.800
Rae and Neil told us that there's
only two guys playing this game.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.520
Even if one of them's Kenny or Steve,
neither could've murdered Will.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.120
So there's still someone out there
killing.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.760
I think you're right about
the rules going out of the window.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.760
He's started picking his own victims.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.400
You didn't answer Dodson's question.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.320
Did Rae think you may be in danger?
Nah. Not really.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.480
How are you holding up?

19:59.520 --> 20:02.320
Which version do you want?
We will get through this.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.880
If Taisie's convicted,
she could get a custodial.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.840
At best she'll get put
on the sex offenders' register.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.800
and that's it,
her life broken beyond repair.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.240
I've got this screen in my head

20:16.280 --> 20:21.160
and it keeps playing this footage
of me giving that phone to Taisie,

20:21.200 --> 20:23.520
knowing everything
that exposes her to,

20:23.560 --> 20:25.280
everything we're dealing with.

20:25.320 --> 20:29.000
And I know it sounds daft,
because everyone's got one,

20:29.040 --> 20:35.680
but I feel like I bought her a gun
when I gave her that phone.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.800
Do you fancy taking some time off?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.920
Don't do that to me.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.720
I need to be here. You need me here.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.760
Who would you come to the loo with?

20:52.160 --> 20:54.400
If you're gonna stop speaking
every time I walk in,

20:54.440 --> 20:56.560
you're never gonna get
any good gossiping done.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.680
I was looking at the data
from Kenny's phone,

20:59.720 --> 21:02.040
and noticed he had a running app
on it.

21:02.080 --> 21:05.320
I use the same one.
It maps and tracks your routes.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.880
One of Kenny's regular routes
was down by the canal,

21:07.920 --> 21:10.600
right past where our Czech boy
Lukas Balusek was found.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.800
We know it's a cruising ground.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.200
Maybe Kenny went there
for more than a run?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.280
Maybe they knew each other.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.480
Get uniforms down there
with Kenny's picture.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.840
See if any of the local users
recognise him.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.880
Good work.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.200
Told you you'd get to like her.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.880
Nah, not yet.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.160
'My name is Kenny Medford.'

21:36.200 --> 21:40.160
'I will not answer
any of your questions.'

21:40.200 --> 21:42.920
Kenny's credit check's come back.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.080
There's no sign
of any money problems.

21:45.120 --> 21:49.280
His behaviour in the interview
yesterday is almost rehearsed.

21:49.320 --> 21:53.400
This broken record thing,
could it be a military technique?

21:53.440 --> 21:56.600
Or activist? The Mark Winstone
murder at the Neo-Nazi rally

21:56.640 --> 21:59.040
could've been politically motivated?
Mm.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.040
I've looked everywhere.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.560
I can't find it.

22:20.560 --> 22:22.680
Run his name past the armed forces.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.760
Nice one, Sherlock.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.040
Kenny's in the Royal Artillery. He's
been AWOL for the last three weeks.

22:38.080 --> 22:41.280
He was facing a charge for cruelty
to animals in Afghanistan.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.040
Why didn't it come up on the PNC?

22:43.080 --> 22:46.480
Because the army waits 28 days
before they issue an arrest warrant.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.200
I want you to bring Kenny back in.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.760
Have we got any new evidence
to justify that?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.600
Him and Carrie have been lying to us.
That's not new evidence.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.920
Dodson doesn't want him in custody.
For this case.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.800
Look, I'll be doing the army a favour,
bringing him in to await collection.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.960
Jenna Mawson's still in danger,
and we don't know he's not involved.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.240
One less person on the street is one less
to worry about. And that sounds good to me.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.960
And take Mitch,
cos I'm sick of the sight of him.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.880
I can't find the book.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.680
If I lose my job, I don't know
how Gina is gonna take it.

23:26.720 --> 23:29.200
I don't know, we're good,
but if this kicks off,

23:29.240 --> 23:32.760
I'm really scared about what could
happen. I couldn't live.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.560
It won't come to that.

23:34.600 --> 23:37.960
Just come clean and remind everyone
what a good cop you are.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.720
I did. I told Rachel.

23:42.880 --> 23:47.240
Hello. 'Sorry to bother you, love,
but there's ructions th.

23:47.280 --> 23:51.440
What's happening? 'I was guarding
the front door <f

23:51.480 --> 23:55.480
and you'd think I'd assassinated Ed
Sheeran. She's going mental.'

23:55.840 --> 23:57.920
Janet?
Just a minute.

23:57.960 --> 24:01.880
If she won't turn the music down,
turn the electricity off.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.280
Hello? Police.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.840
" Anyone there?"

24:09.880 --> 24:11.920
Look, Mum, I've got to go.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.880
Could you not wait just a minute?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.400
Mitch?

24:27.080 --> 24:29.200
Mitch?

24:40.160 --> 24:42.000
I have an officer down.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.760
'Get yourself to safety.' I'm coming
in, Kenny. No, leave.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.000
'No, stay where you
are.'

24:54.720 --> 24:58.720
'Are you all right, Janet?' Everything's
fine. We're in the living room.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.280
Kenny has his daughter.
'Is the child safe?'

25:02.320 --> 25:04.080
Put the phone down.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.960
It's all right, Kenny.
Put it down.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
It's OK.
Gimme the phone, gimme the phone!

25:10.760 --> 25:12.840
Daddy, don't!

25:15.480 --> 25:17.520
You're scaring me! It's all right,
Mitch.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.640
It's all right, Mitch. Stop, stop
it.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.920
It's gonna be OK. How do you feel?

25:29.840 --> 25:32.800
You're all right.
Everything's gonna be OK.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.640
You did this to us.

25:34.680 --> 25:38.760
Whatever we've done, Kenny,
I'm sorry.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.840
But please, put the knife down.

25:42.880 --> 25:46.600
You're scaring Rosie. Let her go.
I can't leave her on her own.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.560
She'll have you and her mum. Please,
please, please.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.480
I'm scared.
I'm scared too.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.080
But everything can be OK.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.560
I know it -
it doesn't look like it.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.120
We can speak to the army
about you being AWOL.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.320
Things can get better
as soon as you put that knife down.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.360
It wasn't meant to end like this.

26:11.320 --> 26:15.320
It was going to be
quiet and peaceful.

26:15.360 --> 26:19.720
Carrie wasn't in pain and this one
wouldn't have known.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.840
And then me.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.560
And then he turned up.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.960
We can sort all that out, Kenny,
I promise you.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.880
You believe me, don't you?

26:33.920 --> 26:35.800
You made Carrie scared of me.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.560
What do you want us to tell her?

26:42.360 --> 26:44.120
I loved her so much.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.320
If I'd have left her here
and just killed myself,

26:47.360 --> 26:49.280
she wouldn't have coped.

26:50.640 --> 26:55.120
So I killed her
as gently as I could.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.080
I couldn't leave her behind
to blame herself.

26:58.120 --> 27:03.240
And I can't let this one grow up
thinking I didn't love her.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.360
But she will grow up, Kenny.
Look at her.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.000
Let her grow up, Kenny.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.080
My daughter, Taisie...

27:24.120 --> 27:26.320
she gave me such
a filthy look this morning

27:26.360 --> 27:30.240
and I thought, "You just wait
until you've got kids of your own"

27:30.280 --> 27:32.120
and they do that to you."

27:32.160 --> 27:36.640
They have no idea how much
we love them, do they, Kenny?

27:36.680 --> 27:39.240
I think she'll have lots of kids.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.160
How many kids
do you think Rosie'll have?

27:41.800 --> 27:45.360
Mitch here, he's got two boys.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.840
When Taisie was a baby
I made a promise

27:50.880 --> 27:54.800
that I'd suffer anything
as long as she was safe and happy.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.000
That's all we want for them,
isn't it, Kenny?

27:57.040 --> 27:59.520
It's too late.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.560
Nothing's ever too late, Kenny.
Look at me.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.120
It's not too late.

28:05.160 --> 28:09.680
When you first held her, Kenny,
what did you want for Rosie?

28:09.720 --> 28:11.760
I wanted her to be happy.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.160
This, what you're doing now,

28:14.200 --> 28:17.560
you think you're stopping her
feeling pain. I understand that.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.720
But you're not.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.160
You're just stopping
that chance of happiness.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.440
Give her to me, Kenny.
No.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.480
Let her go.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.080
(I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.)

28:54.120 --> 28:56.200
Sorry, sorry.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.720
I'm sorry.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.720
(Go.)

29:13.640 --> 29:15.760
Go!

29:28.320 --> 29:31.080
I needed to come here, Gina,
to tell you how brave he was,

29:31.120 --> 29:33.720
going into that house on his own.

29:36.840 --> 29:41.720
He was very brave. He was trying
to save a child's life.

29:43.440 --> 29:47.000
Then he was probably doing it
for show, like everything else.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.920
Milk?

29:52.560 --> 29:54.600
I tried my best, Gina.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.440
I had an opportunity
with someone else last year.

29:57.480 --> 30:01.440
But Ian convinced me to stay.
He kept saying it was for the kids,

30:01.480 --> 30:05.200
but I reckon he couldn't face
the humiliation

30:05.240 --> 30:08.360
in front of his mates. You lot.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.800
He told me about losing the daybook.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.320
I guess this lets you off the hook.

30:16.360 --> 30:20.360
No ugly choices
between his and your career.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.960
Oh, God.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.480
I'm so sorry, Gina.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.600
I tried. I...

30:37.680 --> 30:39.680
I really tried.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.600
It'll all come out,

30:48.640 --> 30:53.200
particularly when whoever's got the
daybook hears about Mitch's death.

30:54.680 --> 31:00.240
We could wait until after the
funeral. Protect his reputation.

31:00.280 --> 31:05.320
It'd just feel like
we were protecting our own backs.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.360
Why did he go into that house
on his own?

31:08.400 --> 31:11.000
It's just - it's page one.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.200
Because I was on the phone.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.760
You knew he was going in
and didn't back him up? No!

31:15.800 --> 31:17.800
I had no idea
he wasn't going to wait for me.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.480
Sorry. I had a go at him.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.320
Maybe he was doing it
to prove he wasn't useless.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.840
It was just a mistake.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.280
In terms of Kenny,
Syndicate 9 are no longer involved.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.840
Syndicate 8 will be investigating
the circumstances

32:16.880 --> 32:20.200
into Mitch and Carrie's deaths.

32:20.240 --> 32:24.840
The army have confirmed
that on the dates of the murders,

32:24.880 --> 32:28.000
Kenny was on duty in Afghanistan.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.320
I had requested that information.

32:30.360 --> 32:34.720
Kenny had suffered post-traumatic
stress disorder since 2009.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.320
He'd only sought help
in the last six months.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.360
He'd gone AWOL whilst
receiving in-service treatment.

32:41.400 --> 32:45.080
He had nothing to do with
the Taking Out The Trash killings.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.960
When the dust settles,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.640
we'll talk about why you chose
that course of action.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.560
You knew I didn't want Kenny
in custody.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.680
You couldn't have known
what was going to happen.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.440
He'd already killed his wife.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.200
My actions saved the life of a child.

33:07.240 --> 33:10.800
But cost the life
of a police officer.

34:24.679 --> 34:27.400
Steve Dench is having an affair.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.280
According to these,

34:29.320 --> 34:32.120
Steve eats at the same place
every Saturday night,

34:32.159 --> 34:34.840
Oliver's Restaurant
on Reddish High Street.

34:36.159 --> 34:40.080
The woman at the gym who
gave him his alibi, Marion Coleman,

34:40.120 --> 34:42.199
she lives on Baslow Crescent,

34:42.239 --> 34:44.320
a stone's throw
from Reddish High Street.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.199
So even if you are right and he is
a cheat, where does it get us?

34:48.239 --> 34:51.040
If he is having an affair, that's
another location we should search

34:51.080 --> 34:53.920
for the murder weapon, the hoodie
the witness saw, and evidence

34:53.960 --> 34:57.720
that Steve accessed the Taking Out
The Trash website from a computer.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.640
It doesn't get us past
his wife's alibi

34:59.680 --> 35:01.640
for the morning
of Edgerton's murder.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.840
Joanne's adamant that at the time
Edgerton was murdered,

35:04.880 --> 35:06.920
Steve hadn't left the house.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.640
Maybe she just lied?
For what reason?

35:09.680 --> 35:12.160
There's a sandwich wrapper
from Steve's car.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.040
It was made
the day Edgerton was murdered.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.640
That's one place we know he stopped
that we haven't checked,

35:16.680 --> 35:18.280
that we should be searching.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.920
Sorry - can I ask
when we're knocking off tonight?

35:20.960 --> 35:25.080
I'm struggling being here knowing
that the guy who killed M

35:25.120 --> 35:27.280
and I'm doing nothing about it.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.360
So maybe it would be better
if we finished a bit early,

35:30.400 --> 35:33.800
if that's all right with you,
and we raise a glass to Mitch.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.960
I should have said something.
I'm sorry.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Of course. This is something

35:38.040 --> 35:40.600
we can explore more -
First round's on me.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.640
Let's finish up, call it a night.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.040
You not coming to the pub?

36:06.080 --> 36:08.800
Er... I don't drink.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.800
And I've got work
I really want to finish.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.040
Are you sure?
Yeah.

36:19.360 --> 36:22.960
It's the evidence-gathering
video from the Neo-Nazi riot.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.960
The Mark Winstone murder.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.800
You getting anywhere?
Yes...

36:28.840 --> 36:31.560
No. I don't know.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.040
This is the moment
Mark Winstone goes down.

36:39.640 --> 36:43.000
You can see how many people
are pressed against him.

36:43.040 --> 36:48.280
He falls here, but the knifing could
have happened seconds before.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.680
We can't even tell which side
the blow comes from.

36:50.720 --> 36:53.480
It could be any one of them.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.520
I'm seeing if I can trace
all the people around him,

36:56.560 --> 36:58.640
find better images of them
elsewhere.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.560
The original investigating team
must've done all this.

37:01.600 --> 37:05.560
Yeah... they struggled
to identify them.

37:05.600 --> 37:09.640
But they weren't looking for
Steve Dench, and they weren't me.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.560
Is Mitch your first death on the job?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.200
It's hard.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.480
Makes it harder
to get out there.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.880
Makes the job that bit scarier.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.920
So stay frightened,

37:32.960 --> 37:35.920
and keep reminding yourself
of what happened.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.920
Then you'll never do what Mitch did.

37:38.960 --> 37:44.200
You'll never put yourself in danger
like him.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.280
He was an idiot.

37:52.480 --> 37:55.080
Maybe see you down there later.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.640
It must be really tough for you.

38:31.680 --> 38:35.720
Why's that, then, Pete?

38:35.760 --> 38:38.440
Well, you're nobody's
favourite person right now,

38:38.480 --> 38:41.400
and now's the time
you need your mates around you.

38:43.880 --> 38:48.200
If you stopped being such a high-
and-mighty wanker with everyone,

38:48.240 --> 38:50.080
you'd do right.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.720
Stop being a wanker.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.760
Stop pushing so hard.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.080
Do you want another?

39:06.120 --> 39:09.120
Yeah, I need to get out of here.

39:09.160 --> 39:12.120
I don't want to go home just yet.

39:12.160 --> 39:14.720
I know somewhere we can get a drink.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.200
I can't believe she left this here.
I gave this to her.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.040
Have you heard from her?
No.

39:31.960 --> 39:34.280
Are you going to tell her
about Mitch?

39:36.160 --> 39:40.160
I keep meaning to ring her,
but what do you say?

39:40.200 --> 39:43.480
Without work, what have any
of us got to say to one another?

39:46.040 --> 39:48.040
"Mitch..."

39:51.160 --> 39:53.160
"died."

39:59.120 --> 40:01.600
I'm four months pregnant.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.800
I'm not telling anyone,

40:04.840 --> 40:09.120
cos they'll put me in a maternity
dress and stick me on filing.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.760
I don't know
what I'm doing with it yet.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.600
Right.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.880
Well, you'd better decide
pretty quick.

40:22.200 --> 40:27.600
I just don't think I get
this need to have kids.

40:27.640 --> 40:32.120
And I'm not sure I want another me
walking the planet.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.840
I know what goes on in my head.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.640
I know what's in my genes.

40:41.680 --> 40:47.120
My mother wasn't some one-off genetic
experiment gone wrong -

40:47.160 --> 40:50.160
there was centuries of breeding
that went into her.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.160
Literally.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.880
I've only just got rid of her.

40:55.920 --> 40:59.000
I don't want to risk another one
tearing its way out of my stomach.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.960
It's the wrong time.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.600
Or maybe it's the perfect one. You're
home, your career's going,

41:08.640 --> 41:12.440
This could be the start of you
making a new life for yoursel.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.840
This could be the perfect time.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.240
Dodson's made it clear
this promotion is for 14 days only,

41:19.280 --> 41:22.640
and then they'd have to start paying
me properly. Which they won't? No.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.400
I'm thinking of approaching the Met.

41:30.360 --> 41:33.520
London's too easy for you.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.560
If there's a step
to becoming your mum,

41:35.600 --> 41:37.440
it's not the booze, or the money.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.680
It's disappearing yourself
down there.

41:42.040 --> 41:46.680
So you'd say having kids
and the job can work?

41:46.720 --> 41:49.560
If you'd asked me last week,
I'd have said definitely,

41:49.600 --> 41:52.480
but tonight, who knows?

41:52.520 --> 41:58.760
How can I say yes when Mitch's kids
are going to bed without their dad?

41:59.400 --> 42:03.120
I feel like the world's
spun off its axis,

42:03.960 --> 42:05.840
and I need to put it right.

42:18.760 --> 42:22.240
Oh! Hi, Sam.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.160
I'll get my mum.

42:29.960 --> 42:34.480
What you doing here, Janet?
Have you been drinking?

42:34.520 --> 42:37.240
Please, Ruth.

42:37.280 --> 42:40.320
Surely we can sort this out.
It's killing us.

42:40.360 --> 42:43.640
I'd like you to leave. You knew what
they were getting up t.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.280
You even let Taisie sleep over.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.520
We can stop this now. Please?

42:48.560 --> 42:51.640
Those images of Sam
are all over the internet.

42:51.680 --> 42:55.120
We can't stop that.
They're out there forever.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.760
That could affect his whole future.
Somebody's got to pay.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.600
And you're going to make it
a 16-year-old girl?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.920
Your job doesn't put you
and your daughter above the law.

43:05.960 --> 43:09.280
In fact, I don't think you should be
anywhere near this house.

43:09.320 --> 43:12.080
I could have you done
for harassment.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.040
Hi, Anna?

43:16.080 --> 43:18.160
Rachel, I looked at the pictures
posted online

43:18.200 --> 43:20.800
of the star left
at the Mark Winstone murder scene.

43:20.840 --> 43:23.760
Then I looked specifically
at the footage for that area.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.400
And I caught him,

43:26.440 --> 43:28.520
kneeling where that star was drawn.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.160
I mean it must have been him.

43:30.200 --> 43:32.880
'He's wearing a black hoodie.'

43:32.920 --> 43:35.080
I saw the same man near Mark.

43:35.120 --> 43:38.280
He's there
just before Mark is stabbed,

43:38.320 --> 43:44.240
the same black hoodie, invisible
unless you know what to look for.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.880
So I tracked him.

43:48.920 --> 43:52.240
I followed him on CCTV around
the city on the day of the riot.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.800
And then I got him.

43:56.840 --> 44:01.160
That's brilliant. 'It's not a great
picture, but I think.

44:01.200 --> 44:04.160
No. I think it's the witness
at Michael Edgerton's murder,

44:04.200 --> 44:08.480
the one who gave us Steve's
description. No wonder he didn't.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.480
Brilliant. Are you sure?
'Yeah, I think so.'

44:11.520 --> 44:15.520
That's brilliant work, Anna.
Brilliant.

44:15.560 --> 44:19.120
Right. See you in the morning.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.440
'Yeah. 'Night.'

44:44.480 --> 44:46.200
He's been here!

44:46.240 --> 44:48.400
They spent months
preparing the early murders.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.600
Right now they are lashing out,
getting sloppy and making mistakes,

44:51.640 --> 44:53.280
and that is how we'll catch them.

44:53.320 --> 44:56.080
You daft cow.
Are you about to tell me off?

44:56.120 --> 44:59.160
Carry on and you and Taisie can have
a family room at Holloway.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.400
Argh!

45:01.440 --> 45:03.280
I hate this shitty place.

45:03.320 --> 45:06.120
I think I have no choice
but to take you off the case.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.080

45:08.120 --> 45:10.600
and now you want to sign
its death warrant!
