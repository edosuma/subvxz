WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:09.143
Flexed knees absorb recoil.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.279
Gives you better movement too.

00:11.279 --> 00:14.215
Square to the target,
feet in position.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.627
Your goal is
to close the distance.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.762
Within a foot,
it's violence of action.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.000
Remember what I said
about a fulcrum?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.469
Momentum is key. Watch.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.407
Just tap if it's too much, okay?

00:44.612 --> 00:46.680
Once you're here,
it's simple body mechanics.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.149
I have leverage, so even if

00:48.149 --> 00:49.850
Lieutenant Erdos
tries something...

00:51.485 --> 00:54.122
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah. No problem.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.557
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.526
I'll shake it off.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.028
It's a good reminder, you guys.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.831
Sometimes out there
in the field it can get messy.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.437
Okay, yeah,
maybe let's take five.

01:17.745 --> 01:21.649
I mean, are we
really doing this?

01:23.984 --> 01:28.922
15 years, you're trying
to just throw it away.

01:30.591 --> 01:34.662
This is you playing
the victim, as usual.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.036
And which one of us
gave up exactly?

01:45.173 --> 01:46.106
Right.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.715
Can you even look Sophie
and Jack in the eye?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.450
They're old enough to.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.524
Heard the sirens
from our place.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.725
Car bomb.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.260
Vo's got the details.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.494
Victim is Neil Cobb,

02:40.494 --> 02:42.196
an American lawyer
out of Houston.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.364
He and his firm represent

02:43.364 --> 02:45.766
a chemical company
called Avercol.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.701
U.S.-based, but they had plants

02:47.701 --> 02:49.102
and workers here in Budapest.
- Had?

02:49.102 --> 02:51.138
Avercol's in the middle
of a class action lawsuit,

02:51.138 --> 02:52.306
Cobb was lead defense.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.807
It was all over the news.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.843
Hungarian workers got sick
due to chronic exposure

02:55.843 --> 02:57.811
to cadmium, a toxic metal.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.013
Now they're suing Avercol
for damages.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.849
But the American company
is still operating.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.717
When things went south,
they just relocated,

03:03.717 --> 03:05.653
hell for leather.
- Considerate.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.321
Class actions
take years to resolve,

03:07.321 --> 03:10.123
and Avercol is still trying
to negotiate a settlement.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.792
Cobb was heading that up.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.227
It seems clear
he was the intended target.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.497
Then there's MargÃ³ Halmi:
14-year-old walking her dog.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.332
Caught shrapnel in the blast.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.833
She's in critical condition.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.669
Cobb kept a flat
in his name on the Pest side.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.170
It's a crime scene now.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.539
Smitty, your tenure
in explosive disposal unit

03:25.539 --> 03:26.874
could be a real asset here.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.542
I want you on forensics.
- My pleasure.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.777
HNP's on site.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.044
They've confirmed
this is an assassination.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.514
The who and why
are what we are after.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.383
Let's get to it.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.258
Thank you.

03:44.258 --> 03:47.060
Ah, Agent Forrester.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.363
Agent Kellett.
Slight occupational hazard.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.431
I'm fine.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.665
What's the latest?

03:51.665 --> 03:53.066
Bomb was wired
to the ignition.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.669
Driver was killed instantly,
and our only witness

03:55.669 --> 03:57.571
just went into surgery.
- And motive?

03:57.571 --> 04:00.173
We think this was tied
to Mr. Cobb's profession,

04:00.173 --> 04:01.475
his client, specifically.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.976
Avercol has a lot
of enemies here.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.313
Yes, my cousin works
for the municipality,

04:05.313 --> 04:07.214
says that the company
came here to exploit

04:07.214 --> 04:11.352
Hungary's infrastructure,
tax laws, economy, labor force.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.587
Avercol lined their pockets,
and once they were done

04:13.587 --> 04:15.088
poisoning our people, left.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.957
They don't have a lot
of friends around here.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.159
So the locals felt
Cobb had it coming.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.795
How'd the HNP feel about him?
- It's complicated.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.497
There were a few times
he called us claiming

04:23.497 --> 04:24.665
that he was being harassed.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.734
- By whom?
- Never said.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.536
But support here lies
with the plant workers,

04:28.536 --> 04:30.103
and he was one of the more recognizable

04:30.103 --> 04:31.472
Americans in Budapest.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.773
So we took the threat
very seriously

04:32.773 --> 04:35.008
but found no substance
behind it.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.346
And then he accused the police
of scheming against him.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.047
Cobb seemed paranoid.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.949
Or perceptive,
based on the fact

04:41.949 --> 04:43.717
that he was just assassinated.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.854
Yes, we should have
been more responsive.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.022
The explosive residue
is off to the lab.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.825
Obviously, every component
used to build this bomb

04:51.825 --> 04:53.661
was blown apart, but that
doesn't mean

04:53.661 --> 04:55.062
the pieces vanished.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.964
A proper post-blast search,
and we just might

04:56.964 --> 04:58.131
be able to put it
back together.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.400
Could lead us somewhere.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.768
- I can arrange that.
- Great.

05:00.768 --> 05:01.935
I'm gonna check
with Raines and Vo,

05:01.935 --> 05:04.304
see if they've found anything.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.874
Putting aside any
personal views on Avercol,

05:06.874 --> 05:08.208
please know that you have
the full cooperation--

05:08.208 --> 05:09.643
Your arm is broken.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.712
Oh, no, don't worry,
the bone is fine.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.948
This is just precaution.
I'll be okay, I promise.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.817
Lieutenant, I admire
your confidence,

05:16.817 --> 05:20.120
but maybe I'd feel better
hearing that from a doctor.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.822
Okay, fair enough.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.191
Although Hungarian tradition
says that

05:24.191 --> 05:25.826
if you break someone's arm,
you have to dispense

05:25.826 --> 05:27.928
with the formalities.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.763
My friends call me Ben.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.003
We have Cobb's U.S. phone,

05:36.003 --> 05:38.238
but it's been turned off
for months--not much there.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.210
HNP found a prepaid cell
in the car, too,

05:43.210 --> 05:45.278
burnt to a crisp
along with a leather bag.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.880
Nothing in it survived.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.281
All right, see if you can
pull anything from that burner.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.150
There's a cleared-out
safe over there.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.587
The only prints we found here
belonged to Cobb.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.088
All right.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.127
All right, the killer
knew where he lived.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.997
And he knew what he drove.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.899
Did they just want Cobb or were
they after something else?

06:05.899 --> 06:08.669
This is my boss's apartment.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.203
Let me in.
You can't touch anything.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.872
Let me in. He's my boss.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.474
I'm his emergency contact.

06:13.474 --> 06:17.244
Can somebody just tell me
what happened here, please?

06:17.244 --> 06:20.548
Sorry, I don't think I should
be talking to the FBI.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.982
I need to call the firm.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.918
I get your hesitation,
but this was clearly targeted.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.187
Somebody wanted Cobb dead.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.989
And what you share now
could be crucial.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.391
I'm just an associate.
It's my first year at the firm.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.961
You and Cobb were here
to depose the plaintiffs.

06:35.463 --> 06:38.298
We heard there might
have been bad blood there.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.535
I know that this is a lot
and your head is spinning,

06:41.535 --> 06:43.637
but Cobb's family overseas
is about to learn the news

06:43.637 --> 06:45.072
of what just happened.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.476
Just talk to us.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.409
We're just trying to help.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.914
He had enemies
in Budapest, right?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.885
Our job was to ensure
the case won't go to trial

06:57.885 --> 07:00.087
and that Avercol pays
as little as possible.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.389
That's gonna ruffle feathers.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.991
If you ask me, I think
the plant workers

07:03.991 --> 07:05.693
were just tired
of Neil's games.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.027
Explain.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.796
Plaintiffs knew any
settlement offer from us

07:08.796 --> 07:10.430
would be lowball,
but Neil kept trying

07:10.430 --> 07:12.099
to push the number lower.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.468
He's not stupid.
He knew they'd never go for it.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.737
Well, that's a leap from them
strapping an IED to his car.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.038
Look, I'm not saying
it's what happened,

07:18.038 --> 07:20.974
but if Neil was stalling,

07:20.974 --> 07:22.843
what if someone decided
to take him out?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.712
And what if they're
not finished?

07:24.712 --> 07:25.846
We can get you
police protection for now,

07:25.846 --> 07:27.948
but you need to stay local.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.917
When's the last time
you saw Cobb?

07:29.917 --> 07:32.019
The last deposition
was two weeks ago.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.420
Since then, nothing.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.322
Maybe we're dealing
with a sympathizer.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.957
Family, friends?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.026
Plant workers believe they're
the victim in this narrative.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.561
If they thought Avercol
was now planning

07:40.561 --> 07:42.329
to rob them in broad daylight,

07:42.329 --> 07:43.731
there's no telling
what they'd do.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.799
- Scott?
- Yeah?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.404
Left on our windshield.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.742
I didn't see who left it.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.410
No trace DNA
and zero witnesses

07:57.410 --> 07:59.079
since we parked
around the corner.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.514
Whoever left it
for us was careful.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.616
There was the empty safe
in Cobb's flat.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.784
Maybe these files
went with him.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.252
Which means we're too late.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.020
Is this a tip?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.889
Elia and the HNP think
someone took out Cobb

08:08.889 --> 08:11.258
to send a message to Avercol.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.827
That person has the full story.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.729
They could be trying
to read us in.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.030
They might have a lead
on the killer.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.498
Just scared to stick
their neck out.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.134
Smitty's still working
on the bomb reconstruction.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.336
But get this, main ingredient
in the blast residue

08:23.336 --> 08:26.373
wasn't C-4 or Semtex,
it's TATP.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.776
Same thing like the Manchester
bombing, Paris attacks.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.343
So this could
have been homemade?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.212
Out of the 18 plaintiffs
involved in the suit,

08:32.212 --> 08:36.316
flagged one with a criminal
record, Daniel SimÃ³n.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.018
After Avercol shut down
their plants,

08:38.018 --> 08:39.352
Daniel became a truck driver

08:39.352 --> 08:41.121
for a few factories
in Budapest.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.190
So the job would have given him
access to raw chemicals,

08:43.190 --> 08:45.125
including acetone
and hydrogen peroxide.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.660
Components for TATP.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.129
Got an address for Daniel.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.330
Go.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.147
I'm looking for Daniel SimÃ³n.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.148
Inside.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.857
Dani.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.294
Dani.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.500
He's on medication.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.136
Tell me why you're here.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.505
Head counsel for Avercol
was killed this morning.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.774
We think it's related

09:33.774 --> 09:35.108
to the class action
Dani was a part of.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.077
Can we take a look around?

09:38.378 --> 09:41.949
Do your business,
but do it quietly.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.651
He needs to rest.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.295
The bombing was on the news,

09:55.295 --> 09:58.165
but we don't speak
about that company in our home.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.868
I won't put more stress
on my husband.

10:00.868 --> 10:01.969
We're very sorry
for everything

10:01.969 --> 10:03.871
you two are going through.

10:03.871 --> 10:07.207
The metal
that poisoned everyone,

10:07.207 --> 10:13.213
cadmium, it targets kidneys,
lungs, and bone.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.851
He gave everything to that job,

10:17.851 --> 10:21.121
and all they did
was take from us.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.494
We're wondering
if somebody took matters

10:27.494 --> 10:29.129
into their own hands
that could be unhappy

10:29.129 --> 10:30.831
with the settlement amount

10:30.831 --> 10:32.800
or want swifter justice
for the victims.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.635
We are not in touch
with the other workers anymore.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.572
Our lawyer, ZalÃ¡n Madaras,
he represents all the victims.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.341
He's handling everything.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.276
We should talk to him next.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.713
I'll give Forrester
a heads up.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.555
ZalÃ¡n Madaras.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.925
We're investigating
the death of an American.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.827
Hoping you can shed light
on any clients

10:59.827 --> 11:01.294
who dealt with Neil Cobb.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.196
These are good men and women.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.632
Their only crime
is being naive to think

11:05.632 --> 11:08.802
their employer would give
a damn after poisoning them.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.970
They as angry as you?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.538
They're not killers.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.006
Then help us prove it.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.176
I took this case
for no money.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.146
We've already fought
for three years.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.082
My clients don't want a war,
they want to settle.

11:22.082 --> 11:26.119
But Avercol seems ready
to erase our story.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.622
And if the FBI is beholden
to American interests,

11:29.622 --> 11:32.392
you will be
on the wrong side of history.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.828
We're not on a side,
we just want the truth.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.865
An innocent girl
is fighting for her life now

11:37.865 --> 11:39.466
because someone
wanted Cobb gone.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.435
Your clients spoke to him
during the depositions.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.005
They may have information
vital to the case.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.511
RÃ³zsa Chapel, you know it?

11:51.511 --> 11:52.813
Sure.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.982
There's a meeting to discuss
how today's news

11:54.982 --> 11:56.850
will impact the settlement.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.251
I'm going there now.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.652
We'd appreciate any help
you can give.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.154
Tensions are high.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.690
So here's a friendly tip.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.692
Keep your badges hidden.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.621
That burner found
on Cobb's body,

12:34.621 --> 12:36.824
phone records show he called
his family back home,

12:36.824 --> 12:40.027
but the call just before that
was local to another prepaid.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.361
Traceable?

12:41.361 --> 12:42.629
I can run a pretext call
to that number,

12:42.629 --> 12:44.164
and if it pings
the cell tower,

12:44.164 --> 12:45.432
<i>we can narrow down
the location.</i>

12:45.432 --> 12:46.499
Do it.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.071
Number's still active.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.209
He's in the chapel.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.966
FBI, stop right there.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.400
Hands in the air.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.136
Now turn around slowly.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.276
She's one of the plaintiffs.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.044
We're looking
into Neil Cobb's murder.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.612
And you think I did it?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.247
We know that
you were the last person

13:34.247 --> 13:36.149
to talk to him alive.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.452
You have it backwards.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.989
The plant workers
weren't his enemy.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.792
Neil Cobb was working
against Avercol.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.861
He betrayed his own client.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.763
And that's the reason
they had him killed.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.742
I come from
a working-class family.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.244
When Avercol announced
announced its factories

14:04.244 --> 14:07.480
in Budapest, we saw promise
and opportunity.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.416
A fantasy, maybe.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.752
That company knew we were
being exposed to cancer,

14:12.752 --> 14:17.324
and they let it happen,
and then they buried it.

14:17.324 --> 14:20.327
Neil Cobb is the only one
who fought to expose the lie,

14:20.327 --> 14:21.995
and he paid for it.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.631
Did he have proof
about this cover-up?

14:26.199 --> 14:30.303
Internal briefs, recordings
of private conversations,

14:30.303 --> 14:31.939
doctor toxicity reports.

14:31.939 --> 14:35.275
Neil made copies of everything
Avercol thought they destroyed.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.911
And that's enough reason
to have a good man silenced.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.780
This is you?

14:42.682 --> 14:46.253
I wanted to help anonymously.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.688
If Avercol were willing
to kill Neil,

14:48.688 --> 14:50.557
they won't think twice
about me.

14:50.557 --> 14:54.127
But the evidence is gone,
Palma, burned up in the car.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.768
These people
understand oppression.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.903
They'll do whatever
it takes to win.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.140
What was the nature of
your relationship with Cobb?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.442
The man called you
the night he died.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.710
He trusted me.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.312
I had a contact at the news.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.048
We were going to leak
the cover-up to them.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.717
Neil believed Avercol was about
to take drastic measures.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.886
If you knew the reason
for Cobb's death,

15:19.886 --> 15:21.454
you could have
called the police.

15:21.454 --> 15:25.225
I planned to, but without
proof, it's useless.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.360
And then I heard
the FBI was involved.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.963
And you were the only one
Cobb spoke to about this?

15:29.963 --> 15:33.133
Not your lawyer,
not the other plaintiffs?

15:33.133 --> 15:35.268
Neil only confided in me.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.738
Some of the others knew
I had his ear, but that's it.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.340
And once we exposed Avercol,

15:40.340 --> 15:42.942
we'd have the company
by the balls.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.911
Obviously,
they got to him first.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.180
Did Cobb mention anyone
at Avercol

15:47.180 --> 15:48.815
who might have caught wind
of his plan?

15:48.815 --> 15:51.884
Only one person scared him.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.954
Sam Gilroy, the CEO.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.291
That man is pure evil.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.298
If Cobb blew the whistle
on his own client,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.100
Avercol would have
gone down in flames.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.302
There was reason here
to neutralize him.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.072
Assuming the cover-up's true,
she has reason to lie to us.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.373
Well, if it is true,
it explains why Cobb

16:13.373 --> 16:14.941
was dragging his feet
on the settlement.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.209
Maybe he was trying
to buy time,

16:16.209 --> 16:17.877
stack evidence up
against Avercol.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.279
Get a warrant
on Palma's phone.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.381
She might have something
in her exchanges with Cobb.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.317
By now, Cobb's death
is public knowledge in the U.S.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.786
And guess who just
landed in Budapest?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.323
Well, that was fast.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.991
Thought it was weird he would
drop everything for this.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.128
Turns out Gilroy and Cobb
have been friends for decades.

16:35.128 --> 16:38.065
Same college,
same country club membership.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.866
Their kids even go
to the same prep school.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.835
Gilroy basically appointed his
frat brother to represent him.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.537
Seems they both got
obscenely rich together.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.374
Maybe after 30 years
of protecting this scumbag,

16:47.374 --> 16:49.342
Cobb finally had enough.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.182
How's the post-blast coming?

16:55.182 --> 16:56.449
<i>I can tell you one thing,</i>

16:56.449 --> 16:58.085
<i>whoever built this bomb
was trying hard</i>

16:58.085 --> 16:59.919
<i>to make it look like
amateur work.</i>

16:59.919 --> 17:01.721
But the circuitry
says otherwise.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.756
It's a dead ringer
for ex-military.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.258
<i>It's odd, though.</i>

17:05.258 --> 17:06.793
We've nearly put
the whole thing back together,

17:06.793 --> 17:09.162
and we seem to be missing
a detonator.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.030
<i>Never turned up
on our grid search.</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:13.133
All right,
keep us in the loop.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.702
Well, the CEO didn't
plant the bomb.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.072
We've also got about two weeks
since the last deposition

17:19.072 --> 17:20.640
where Cobb's unaccounted for.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.708
Yeah.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.410
Where's his car been?

17:23.410 --> 17:26.079
Traffic cameras
aren't turning up much.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.314
Hungary's plates are linked

17:27.314 --> 17:28.848
to the toll system electronically.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.483
Maybe Cobb got flagged there?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.352
I sent that request
to public road network,

17:32.352 --> 17:34.387
but they're backed up.
It's taking forever.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.356
I may be able
to push that through.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.158
All right, Raines and I
will head to Gilroy's hotel,

17:38.158 --> 17:39.626
get some face time
with our CEO.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.336
Ben?

17:51.871 --> 17:52.872
You're kidding.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.774
Don't worry, it's nothing.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.110
Come on, let's go to my office.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.511
I'm slightly concerned
you'll be in a coffin

17:58.511 --> 17:59.812
next time I see you.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.248
The bone is back in place.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.949
Doctor just wants to err
on the side of caution.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.451
Ugh.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.453
I'm flattered you came by
to check on me, though.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.489
This is awkward.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.890
I need a favor, actually.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.625
We're trying to see
if any tolls here picked up

18:12.625 --> 18:13.926
Cobb's license plate.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.128
Time frame?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.629
As far back
as you can take us.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.732
But the network's backlogged,
and I need to rush this.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.201
I'll make a call.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.735
But for now,
the least you could do

18:22.735 --> 18:25.037
is autograph your handiwork.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.310
You know, Hungarian
tradition says

18:30.310 --> 18:31.911
that if you break
someone's arm,

18:31.911 --> 18:33.246
you have to buy them a beer.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.582
You're really milking this.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.484
Maybe I'm combining
a few traditions.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.322
Surgeons extracted the
shrapnel from the young girl.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.824
- How is she?
- Stable, recovering.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.560
I know at least one person
who would like to see this.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.628
Thank you.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.609
It doesn't seem real.

19:02.609 --> 19:06.679
It feels like just yesterday
we were sauced on champagne,

19:06.679 --> 19:08.248
throwing dice in Macau.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.218
Now you're here to repatriate

19:11.218 --> 19:12.719
your friend's body,
is that right?

19:12.719 --> 19:15.154
Yeah, Neil's done enough time
in Budapest on my behalf.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.123
I'm taking him home.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.991
The crowd here seems
to have it out for us.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.393
I'm sure
the misconduct claims

19:20.393 --> 19:21.961
against your company
aren't helping.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.963
Ah, it's a chess match.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.164
Plant workers are just trying

19:25.164 --> 19:26.433
to squeeze out
a larger settlement.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.268
Or some might say Avercol
is knowingly

19:28.268 --> 19:30.503
suppressing malfeasance.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.804
Any truth there?

19:31.804 --> 19:34.006
A statement like that,
you better have proof.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.443
I heard proof
was in Cobb's possession.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.977
You would have the most
to lose if that evidence

19:37.977 --> 19:39.279
were to get out.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.613
Are you saying I'm a suspect?

19:40.613 --> 19:41.781
You tell me.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.052
I was gonna kick him a bonus
for saving me

19:46.052 --> 19:49.088
nine figures
on this settlement.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.090
He's a great lawyer,
great friend.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.292
It's absurd.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.826
Maybe your friend
came face to face

19:53.826 --> 19:55.562
with the effect of his actions,

19:55.562 --> 19:57.964
changed his mind
about helping you.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.332
I've known him for 30 years.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.033
Trust me, when you get rich
the way he did,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.403
you are immune
to a change of heart.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.506
You seem remarkably blasÃ©
about poisoning your employees.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.509
Look, we've got factories
on three continents.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.312
Things happen in my company
that I'm not always aware of.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.581
Neil got paid
to handle my affairs.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.215
But I didn't know
what he was thinking

20:16.215 --> 20:17.684
or doing half the time.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.319
So maybe he pissed off
the wrong people,

20:19.319 --> 20:21.921
cut his life short,
I don't know.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.057
But I do know
that I had nothing to do

20:25.057 --> 20:27.260
with the bomb
that killed my friend.

20:27.260 --> 20:30.029
So why don't you two
do your damn jobs

20:30.029 --> 20:32.365
and find the son
of a bitch who did.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.806
- Thank you for your time.
- Mm-hmm.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.481
Gilroy didn't even
deny the cover-up.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.982
He knows this investigation's
about murder,

20:49.982 --> 20:51.217
not corporate conspiracy.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.985
You should have
pushed harder.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.488
Guys like him like hearing
the sound of their own voice.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.156
Better to let him think
he's calling the shots,

20:57.156 --> 20:58.625
unless we want to be
dealing with his lawyers.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.560
How we looking?

21:00.560 --> 21:01.994
Doctors pulled
a piece of metal

21:01.994 --> 21:04.497
from our teenager,
saved her life.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.767
Missing blasting cap
was lodged in her rib cage

21:07.767 --> 21:09.336
from the explosion.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.237
<i>Device signature still
points to former military,</i>

21:11.237 --> 21:14.607
and they found writing
on the detonator.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.808
It's in Bulgarian.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.109
Does Avercol have
any ties there?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.911
No trace of a relationship.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.648
This feels like a lone wolf
operating locally.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.416
Well, the KGB used to recruit
Bulgarian soldiers

21:23.416 --> 21:24.617
for covert assassinations.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.852
Might be similar
wet work there.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.887
I tend to agree.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.363
I appreciate you keeping
my client in the loop,

21:36.363 --> 21:38.765
but don't forget
that I represent her.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.200
We've seen too many
vultures already.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.470
That's fair enough.
I'll cut to the chase.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.572
We found spyware on the phone
Palma turned over to us.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.173
What?

21:47.173 --> 21:48.641
Someone was monitoring
your conversations.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.343
My guess is keeping tabs
on you and Cobb.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.978
- Avercol?
- Could have been.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.080
We're still trying to ID
exactly where it came from,

21:54.080 --> 21:55.815
possibly a malware attachment.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.384
Maybe other plaintiffs
were targeted

21:57.384 --> 21:58.818
and their phones
are also compromised.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.554
I was the only one
in communication with Neil.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.625
God, it's all my fault.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.760
They knew and they came
for Neil because of me.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.737
From the start, this has been
David and Goliath.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.606
We've come so close
to a settlement.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.841
Falling back to square one now
will crush us.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.576
We're not trying
to jam up proceedings.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.745
We cannot give Avercol
the satisfaction.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.681
Seeing this through
is what Neil would have wanted.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.921
Road network came through.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.424
The night before he died,
Cobb's Mercedes was flagged

22:37.424 --> 22:38.691
on a tollway outside town.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.326
- Where was he headed?
- Unclear.

22:40.326 --> 22:42.061
The return trip's
interesting, though.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.262
Checkpoint snapped
another photo.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.466
That's not Cobb.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.568
Who's behind the wheel?

22:48.568 --> 22:51.370
It's Elia Cruz,
his associate.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.939
But she said she hadn't
seen him in weeks.

22:52.939 --> 22:55.442
She not only saw him
the night before he blew up,

22:55.442 --> 22:57.209
this girl had his car keys.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.757
Hiding that you had access
to the victim's car

23:10.757 --> 23:12.592
24 hours
before the bomb went off?

23:12.592 --> 23:15.595
It's not a good look.
- Neil was too drunk to drive.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.864
He gets that way sometimes.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.101
I swear, he's literally
passed out in the back seat.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.804
Which is weird, since you
hadn't seen Cobb in weeks?

23:24.804 --> 23:26.906
Okay. I'm sorry I lied.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.108
But there's a reason.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.211
Neil had me pick him up
outside of town

23:32.211 --> 23:36.315
at a gentlemen's club, Plush.

23:36.315 --> 23:40.419
He's been a bit of a mess
ever since his wife left him.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.889
I think he just needs--

23:42.889 --> 23:45.391
needed companionship.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.226
Let's talk optics.

23:47.226 --> 23:50.997
Your budding career as a lawyer
was tied to Cobb.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.966
If he torched his reputation
to take down Avercol,

23:53.966 --> 23:57.169
you had a lot to lose.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.838
What do you mean
take down Avercol?

23:58.838 --> 24:01.207
The cover-up.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.509
What cover-up?

24:06.045 --> 24:08.715
Look, I want to help.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.116
Then no more secrets.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.720
How was Cobb's relationship
with Avercol?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.121
Lucrative.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.790
And you never witnessed
anything unusual?

24:19.726 --> 24:21.160
Our firm has an online system

24:21.160 --> 24:22.862
with access
to Avercol's servers.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.764
It keeps a log
of documents uploaded,

24:24.764 --> 24:26.899
downloaded, or purged.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.968
One night, I got an alert.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.103
It looked like Neil
copied some files

24:31.103 --> 24:33.506
before Avercol wiped them
for good.

24:33.506 --> 24:34.974
The files are long gone,

24:34.974 --> 24:37.810
but there should be a digital
footprint on our portal.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.179
We'd like to review that.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.114
Is there anything else?
- There's one more thing.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.920
A few months ago,
I overheard them on the phone,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.889
a call I shouldn't
have been on.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.224
When exactly?

24:52.224 --> 24:56.162
Last year.
Labor Day, I think.

24:56.162 --> 25:00.667
Neil was--I mean, he was
tearing Mr. Gilroy a new one.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.802
Lawyers don't speak
to their clients that way.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.070
What was the topic?

25:04.070 --> 25:05.504
I only heard a tiny bit,

25:05.504 --> 25:09.408
but I have never heard
my boss so angry.

25:09.408 --> 25:12.411
He kept telling Gilroy
what he did was indefensible.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.581
He used that word.

25:14.581 --> 25:19.218
The whole thing felt
extremely personal.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.120
I'll swing by the strip club,
confirm the story.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.189
Maybe someone there saw Cobb.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.426
Timing's everything.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.196
Cobb's wife Cindy served him
divorce papers last year.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.099
It happened just a week after
the phone call Elia heard.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.934
And it gets worse for Cobb.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.769
Gilroy's credit card history
shows he bought

25:36.769 --> 25:40.472
a penthouse suite and a
five-star hotel in Austin.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.308
Cindy had been staying there
for months.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.877
We've also placed them together
at resorts

25:44.877 --> 25:46.445
in Horseshoe Bay
and Lost Pines.

25:46.445 --> 25:47.947
Elia was right
when she said things

25:47.947 --> 25:49.448
got personal
between these guys.

25:49.448 --> 25:51.718
His wife was cheating
on him with his friend.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.320
Do you think them shacking up
is what lit Cobb's fuse?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.522
Set him down the path
to come after Avercol?

25:56.522 --> 25:59.792
That could mean everything
Palma told us is true.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.561
Gilroy's been holding his
tongue about it long enough.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.996
Let's go.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.906
Before we start,
I want you to be aware

26:13.906 --> 26:15.374
that you don't
have to speak with us.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.976
I'm hoping to find
who did this just like you.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.344
Get on with it.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.079
Were you sleeping
with Cobb's wife?

26:21.648 --> 26:25.785
Another refresher,
title 18, section 1001,

26:25.785 --> 26:28.955
it's a crime to lie to the FBI.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.823
Two consenting adults,
not a crime.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.291
And you don't think
your buddy would have felt

26:32.291 --> 26:33.626
some type of way about it?

26:33.626 --> 26:36.062
Neil wasn't exactly
Mr. Faithful.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.998
Cindy knew that.
- Nice of you to comfort her.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.432
Given your long history,

26:40.432 --> 26:42.168
Cobb's change of heart
makes sense now.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.302
What do you want me to say?

26:43.302 --> 26:44.871
There was a brief fling,
so what?

26:44.871 --> 26:46.639
I made up with my wife.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.808
Look, you want to tell me
he went off the deep end

26:48.808 --> 26:50.442
because of the affair, fine.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.579
But me having him smoked,
uh-uh, that's insane.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.817
You know what that is?

26:57.817 --> 26:59.919
Cobb's firm kept a ledger
of shared information

26:59.919 --> 27:01.854
with their clients.

27:01.854 --> 27:05.191
Cobb accessed Avercol's servers
and withdrew the tox reports.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.927
The real ones that show
the levels of cadmium

27:07.927 --> 27:09.128
plant workers were ingesting,

27:09.128 --> 27:10.562
not the ones that
you doctored up

27:10.562 --> 27:12.064
and replaced them with.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.500
Let me tell you something,
I don't type on computers.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.703
I don't do reports.
I make deals. I manage--

27:16.703 --> 27:18.871
This proves Cobb
had something that you

27:18.871 --> 27:20.172
didn't want getting out.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.440
What's one more life
when you consider

27:21.440 --> 27:23.542
all the ones
Avercol ruined here?

27:23.542 --> 27:25.778
Companies seem to forget
how they get to the top

27:25.778 --> 27:26.813
on the backs of others.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.047
Give me a break.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.849
What Cobb did
in Budapest took courage,

27:29.849 --> 27:31.818
fighting for the workers,
amplifying their voice.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.886
You have no clue
what you're talking about.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.154
Maybe you just
didn't like that.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.423
A fish rots
from the head, right?

27:37.423 --> 27:38.958
You're trying to find
some way to pin this on me

27:38.958 --> 27:41.060
and make him out to be some--
- Cobb knew that Avercol--

27:41.060 --> 27:42.895
The damn cover-up
was his idea!

27:50.369 --> 27:53.105
Cobb suggested
burying the evidence?

27:53.105 --> 27:55.074
Had I actually seen
that ledger before,

27:55.074 --> 27:56.709
if I actually knew
what he was scheming,

27:56.709 --> 27:57.944
I'd have leveled him in court.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.912
Attorney/client privilege
and all that.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.213
Not if he had a plant worker

28:01.213 --> 28:02.614
secretly leak
what he was feeding her.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.084
Cobb had months to make
that happen and never did.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.353
You know why?

28:07.353 --> 28:09.088
He's got a vindictive gene.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.857
It had to be him
who stuck the knife in me.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.058
And if he succeeded?

28:12.058 --> 28:13.292
Then what?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.861
I'd have fired his ass.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.228
Then there would have been
a change-up in lawyers,

28:16.228 --> 28:18.364
put the case on ice.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.300
You can probably guess what
that does to the settlement.

28:21.300 --> 28:25.271
No one sees a dime
for another two years.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.339
Cobb had to have known
his actions

28:27.339 --> 28:29.308
would have screwed over
the victims getting paid.

28:29.308 --> 28:30.877
I don't think Cobb
ever gave a damn

28:30.877 --> 28:32.211
about the plant workers.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.579
He only went off-leash
because of the affair.

28:33.579 --> 28:35.381
Meanwhile, the plaintiffs
were caught

28:35.381 --> 28:37.649
in a messed up tug-of-war
between two narcissists.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.786
So either Gilroy had enough
and took out Cobb

28:39.786 --> 28:42.588
or someone found
a perfect scapegoat in Avercol.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.256
And the killer's
still out there.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.192
Plush turned over
their CCTV footage.

28:46.192 --> 28:48.127
Here's the feed
from their entrance.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.997
You can see Elia grabbing Cobb.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.542
Hang on.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.612
Cobb picked up a tail.

29:06.612 --> 29:09.181
Gray SUV parked across
from the moment Cobb arrived,

29:09.181 --> 29:10.749
just waiting.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.884
This is our guy, isn't it?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.752
You can't make out
the plates here,

29:13.752 --> 29:15.621
but when it shadowed
him home that night,

29:15.621 --> 29:17.289
tollway camera
caught a partial.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.394
Six matches for a gray Chevy
with this partial plate.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.096
Which one's our bomber?

29:24.096 --> 29:25.397
Get closer on the wheels.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.868
Studded tires.

29:28.868 --> 29:32.238
Any one of our six places get
snow or sleet in the winter?

29:32.238 --> 29:35.441
There--VisegrÃ¡d,
north of the city.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.776
Geography and elevation
make it prone to icy weather.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.078
Studded tires make sense.

29:39.078 --> 29:42.614
Property is registered
to MarÃ³t Toth,

29:42.614 --> 29:45.717
50-year-old Hungarian farmer,
no wife, no kids.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.321
He died years ago.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.290
Cobb's assassin seems to be
keeping his memory alive.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.818
Move!

30:42.808 --> 30:45.211
Scott, you okay?

30:45.211 --> 30:47.079
Hey, you okay?

30:47.079 --> 30:48.714
Scott?

30:48.714 --> 30:50.849
I'm good, really.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.953
Okay, we'll call a medic.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.922
If there's any doubt
we had the right address...

30:55.922 --> 30:58.057
Here. Come on.

31:23.782 --> 31:25.451
Check the drives.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.290
Acetone, hydrogen peroxide.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.993
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have TATP.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.894
I reckon we found
Cobb's killer.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.868
Station cop car just
flagged our suspect's vehicle

31:42.868 --> 31:44.236
coming this way.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.445
He's not stopping.

31:57.649 --> 31:58.750
Get in.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.093
In pursuit.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.527
Proceed with caution,
suspect is likely armed.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.072
What the hell is he doing?

32:22.508 --> 32:23.709
Down!

32:42.061 --> 32:43.729
Suspect's definitely armed.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.597
We need spikes now!

33:41.953 --> 33:44.723
Mihail Korvalov,
former demolitionist

33:44.723 --> 33:48.360
for the Bulgarian armed forces,
dishonorably discharged.

33:48.360 --> 33:53.199
Made a lucrative career switch
to hired gun.

33:53.199 --> 33:55.367
Mate, we've got you
on the TATP,

33:55.367 --> 34:00.072
linked you to the car bomb,
murder, evading arrest,

34:00.072 --> 34:02.741
and the trap which nearly
blew up an officer.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.410
You're done.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.145
But we know somebody
put you up to it.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.614
We could always ship him back
to the motherland.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.716
He could stand trial
for his crimes at home.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.284
Great point.

34:12.284 --> 34:15.721
Fancy serving out your days
in a Bulgarian prison cell?

34:15.721 --> 34:17.256
How long would you last
inside those walls

34:17.256 --> 34:18.790
before somebody gets to you?

34:18.790 --> 34:20.326
The other option
is cooperate.

34:20.326 --> 34:21.827
Give up whoever
paid you for the hit.

34:21.827 --> 34:25.331
And if you become a source,
facilitate arrests,

34:25.331 --> 34:27.966
I can put more on the table.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.302
You might just be
worth something.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.305
Crawl before you walk, though.

34:33.305 --> 34:36.041
We want the man who hired you
for Cobb's death.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.549
Mr. Madaras
is currently in a meeting.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.953
Let's go.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.859
He's headed
for the southwest corner!

35:00.031 --> 35:02.268
<i>He's now headed north.</i>

35:06.972 --> 35:08.140
Freeze!

35:10.075 --> 35:11.042
Against the wall!

35:15.281 --> 35:17.015
Hands behind your back.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.022
You're under arrest.

35:25.691 --> 35:26.925
Take him.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.841
For the last year,
Madaras has been trying

35:42.841 --> 35:43.909
to keep his business afloat.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.511
On the brink of a recession,

35:45.511 --> 35:46.912
dude made
some bad financial plays.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.047
Wound up with a slew of debt
he needed clear.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.649
Nail in the coffin's
when he borrowed

35:50.649 --> 35:52.284
from the wrong people.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.953
Korvalov told us
that his fee for Cobb was 50K.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.055
Madaras borrowed
exactly that amount

35:57.055 --> 35:58.924
from these guys,
his last loan from them

35:58.924 --> 36:00.492
at five times the interest.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.894
Says they even made
the introduction.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.696
Before they put a girl
in the hospital.

36:04.696 --> 36:07.065
Most plaintiff attorneys
are paid on contingency.

36:07.065 --> 36:08.567
They only get their cut
once the settlement

36:08.567 --> 36:09.835
has been reached.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.903
Madaras had no way
to fix the situation.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.539
His only hope was the payout.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.874
Which he would have gotten
if not for Cobb,

36:15.874 --> 36:17.909
the man who threatened
to unravel the whole thing

36:17.909 --> 36:19.411
if he blew the whistle.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.847
If that man exposed Avercol,

36:21.847 --> 36:24.316
it would have meant more money
for my clients

36:24.316 --> 36:27.453
and 15% of a bigger pie for me.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.920
Why would I try and stop that?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.223
Because you were out of time.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.825
Cobb's vendetta against Gilroy
was a setback for cash

36:33.825 --> 36:35.294
you desperately needed now.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.363
Working three years
on a pro bono case

36:37.363 --> 36:38.830
killed your finances.

36:38.830 --> 36:42.167
Throw a few loan sharks
in the mix, debt racking up,

36:42.167 --> 36:44.370
collateral you shouldn't
have put down,

36:44.370 --> 36:46.472
you're running scared.

36:46.472 --> 36:47.806
And you're speculating.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.107
We confiscated your PC

36:49.107 --> 36:51.577
and found monitoring software installed.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.779
It matches the spyware
on Palma's phone.

36:53.779 --> 36:56.214
You kept tabs on her
conversations with Cobb.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.983
So that's how you knew
that he was gearing up

36:57.983 --> 37:01.320
to leak the evidence,
and you had to act.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.655
With Cobb dead and Avercol
taking the fall for it,

37:03.655 --> 37:07.192
you hoped the settlement
would be expedited.

37:07.192 --> 37:09.295
Time to come clean.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.463
We'll skip legal gridlock
if you do the right thing.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.005
You don't have
to say anything.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.107
Just know the Bulgarian
rolled on you.

37:22.107 --> 37:24.310
And he'll testify that
you hired him to kill Cobb

37:24.310 --> 37:27.446
and which high-risk lender
sent you his fee.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.880
I'd like to make a deal too.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.316
We're a little past that.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.383
That's not fair.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.251
Fair?

37:33.251 --> 37:36.087
What about the 18 lives
you were supposed to defend

37:36.087 --> 37:38.189
or the girl who got caught
in the crossfire

37:38.189 --> 37:41.259
when you hired a hit man
to blow up Cobb?

37:43.228 --> 37:45.096
Your people trusted you,

37:45.096 --> 37:48.534
and you used them like a shield
to hide behind.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.569
Maybe it's time you faced them.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.789
I'm here to remind you
of a broken promise.

38:16.562 --> 38:17.996
Daniel SimÃ³n.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.831
He proposed to his wife

38:19.831 --> 38:22.768
at Lake Velence
on a rented boat.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.604
She said it was
the windiest day.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.939
They both wanted children,

38:27.939 --> 38:29.875
little ones to play with
in the garden

38:29.875 --> 38:32.344
and read stories to before bed.

38:32.344 --> 38:35.013
But then Dani got sick.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.554
Beatrice Farkas.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.456
She taught herself
five languages

38:44.456 --> 38:46.758
but fell in love with Spanish.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.628
She has an itch to travel.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.497
Wanted to see
the Amazon rainforest

38:51.497 --> 38:53.231
since she was a girl.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.440
Palma KovÃ¡cs.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.675
Likes to sing pop songs
in the shower

39:03.675 --> 39:05.644
and paint landscapes,

39:05.644 --> 39:08.447
prefers sunrises to sunsets.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.081
Her favorite season is winter.

39:13.485 --> 39:16.622
I'm so sorry.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.537
The victims get more money.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.505
Case doesn't go to trial.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.973
Chapter comes to an end.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.709
And Sam Gilroy gets
to walk away from all of this.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.210
That's not justice.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.246
There may be a silver lining
with that.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.615
When Gilroy admitted
the cover-up was Cobb's idea,

39:43.615 --> 39:45.350
he implicated himself.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.252
The bureau can now
open an investigation

39:47.252 --> 39:48.987
with the assistant
U.S. attorney.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.856
Evidence concealment, conspiracy,

39:50.856 --> 39:52.390
and obstruction of justice.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.627
Gilroy and Avercol go under
the microscope back home.

39:55.627 --> 39:58.630
The FBI will build a case
while the settlement resolves.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.165
No guarantees
of a conviction,

40:00.165 --> 40:03.101
but it will turn his life
upside down.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.470
That's a fraction
of what he deserves,

40:04.470 --> 40:07.405
but I'm glad
you're with us on this.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.509
This kind of tragedy hits
the community a certain way.

40:10.509 --> 40:13.579
Not everyone can act
in those situations.

40:13.579 --> 40:16.381
Palma, what you've done,

40:16.381 --> 40:19.084
how far you're willing to go
for what you believe...

40:21.753 --> 40:24.355
It's bravery.

40:28.359 --> 40:31.463
So my sister kept adding
cocoa powder the entire time.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.164
For the Georgian half
of my family,

40:33.164 --> 40:34.966
this khinkali
was the most offensive thing

40:34.966 --> 40:36.234
they'd ever eaten.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.008
You know,
if you need someplace to be,

40:43.008 --> 40:45.210
it's really, really okay.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.312
You honored Hungary
by purchasing this beer.

40:47.312 --> 40:49.347
Sorry, caught me in a moment.

40:49.347 --> 40:52.350
I listen well,
if you feel like sharing.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.454
I just found myself
thinking about this case

40:56.454 --> 41:00.826
and all the collateral damage,
the victims of Avercol.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.061
It's not even just the workers;

41:03.061 --> 41:06.264
it's everyone around them
who lost something.

41:06.264 --> 41:10.602
And even with Cobb,
a teenager became a casualty

41:10.602 --> 41:12.437
just for being there,
and now her parents

41:12.437 --> 41:13.939
have to deal with that.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.440
Who's looking out
for any of them?

41:20.278 --> 41:22.380
Up for taking a drive with me?

41:22.380 --> 41:24.015
Sure.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.250
Oh, you mean now?

41:25.250 --> 41:26.918
Maybe we order
a few things to go.

41:26.918 --> 41:27.953
Do you have a menu?

41:30.288 --> 41:32.958
Oh, that's good.
I hope you're holding up.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.560
My friend and I were
just in the neighborhood,

41:34.560 --> 41:37.095
and I'm glad she's doing okay.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.497
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:41.700 --> 41:42.901
Everything okay?

41:42.901 --> 41:45.571
Yeah, no, perfect.

41:45.571 --> 41:46.905
You've been a good sport.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.907
I think I owe you
a proper drink.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.442
Call it an American tradition.

41:56.081 --> 41:57.015
So how long do you
have to wear it?
