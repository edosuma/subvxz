because a lot of times

03:54.950 --> 03:56.890
people can get in your head.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.390
You seemed pretty salty

about Scarlet calling you out
on the runway.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.390
[Ra'Jah] I did feel
some type of way about it

04:05.390 --> 04:07.760
just because, like, you know,

04:07.760 --> 04:09.830
if you know you're the weakest,
admit that shit.

04:09.830 --> 04:11.330

you weren't the Tee.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.900
You're going to throw me
under the bus?

04:13.900 --> 04:15.270
But I already knew
that bus was coming,

04:15.270 --> 04:17.010
and I was ready.

04:17.010 --> 04:19.610

to be her greatest saboteur.

[Brooke Lynn] The pressure,
you can see, is getting to her.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.180
She's already lip synced twice.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.650
She just kind of
has these meltdowns.

04:29.650 --> 04:30.920
It might be her turn to go.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.620

Make every moment count.

04:33.620 --> 04:36.060

that moment count

04:36.060 --> 04:38.130
with what you got
and what you brought,

04:38.130 --> 04:39.630
then lip sync
for your motherfucking life.

04:39.630 --> 04:41.060
Bye, bitch.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.900
And hopefully
turn that shit out.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.900
-Hey.
-Hey, my sister.

-Bitch!
-Bitch, that's it.

04:49.410 --> 04:51.070
[Ra'Jah] I feel like
the target on my back

04:51.070 --> 04:53.340
is the fact that
I've been in the bottom.

04:53.340 --> 04:55.080
But I'm feeling very vindicated

04:55.080 --> 04:58.210

sync assassin has struck again.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.420

11:02.410 --> 11:04.580
Gentlemen, start your engines,

11:04.580 --> 11:09.320
and may the best woman win.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.690
[Vanjie] This week's Maxi
Challenge is farm-to-runway.

11:12.690 --> 11:15.720
We have to create
a fashionable look

11:15.720 --> 11:18.060
using natural materials.

11:18.060 --> 11:21.330
Oh, I could take all these
sponges and make a sponge dress.

11:21.330 --> 11:24.270
[Vanjie] We gotta take eggs
and beans and rope

11:24.270 --> 11:26.800
and try to make
high fashion clothing.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.070
I'm shaking in my boots.

11:28.070 --> 11:29.170
[Shuga] Come on, snap peas.

11:29.170 --> 11:31.440
Bitch, I'm here just to eat.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.680
[laughs]

11:32.680 --> 11:34.480
Is this kale?

11:36.310 --> 11:38.980
Honey, I'm eating
all the fruit, the seeds.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.750
I don't even know what
my garment's going to be.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.720
What's this?
Is that food or is that chalk?

11:42.720 --> 11:46.060
All I know is the food is good,
and I am here for it.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.590
[laughs]

11:47.590 --> 11:49.890
Eat it.

11:49.890 --> 11:52.560
[Brooke] I'm thinking something
like really structured.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.830
What are you thinking of doing?

11:53.830 --> 11:57.000
Probably like a corset and have
it like shoots feathers.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.400
I have like a lot of feathers.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.670
I love a good design challenge.

12:00.670 --> 12:03.870
But Brooke Lynn has beaten me
for both of them.

12:03.870 --> 12:05.870
I hate her.
No, I'm just kidding.

12:05.870 --> 12:08.140
I think this
is my chance to prove

12:08.140 --> 12:12.280
that I can do something
no matter what you throw at me.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.450
[Plastique] You'll make it work.

12:13.450 --> 12:16.120
Because you won
both of the design challenge.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.920
I'm not mad about it.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.620
[Brooke Lynn] Just like you're
not mad about those wigs.

12:19.620 --> 12:22.090
[laughs]

12:22.090 --> 12:24.490
I love you.
I hope you win.

12:24.490 --> 12:25.860
[Ra'Jah]
So how you feeling, bitch?

12:25.860 --> 12:28.000
Confused,
because my creative mind

12:28.000 --> 12:29.870
don't just be like, okay,
boom, I see something.

12:29.870 --> 12:31.770
I gotta cut something up,
glue something,

12:31.770 --> 12:33.100
be like, girl,
this ain't gonna work for me,

12:33.100 --> 12:34.140
and go from there.

12:34.140 --> 12:36.340
So I'm just like, oh, my God.

12:36.340 --> 12:39.780
I think A'Keria
really isn't jazzed

12:39.780 --> 12:43.950
at the idea of having to use
alternative materials,

12:43.950 --> 12:46.980
especially since her drag
is very not that.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.320
[Ra'Jah] Girl, you say that,

12:48.320 --> 12:51.250
but then you turn out
a sickening look as always.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.960
Yeah, but see, I just need more
than just a sickening look.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.060
I need another win.

12:55.060 --> 12:57.130
You know, that tasted
real good.

12:57.130 --> 13:00.400
Who needs it is the doll.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.070
It's kind of crazy, because like
in all of the sewing challenges,

13:03.070 --> 13:05.400
I always find myself just safe.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.840
So I want to see
how I can push my limit.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.040
Yeah.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.370
But still keep it high fashion,
keep it Ra'Jah.

13:11.370 --> 13:13.340
I did walk in to the workroom

13:13.340 --> 13:15.640
in an unconventional
paper challenge.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.450
So I'm feeling
very on top of the moon,

13:17.450 --> 13:19.250
like, bitch,
this is your challenge to win.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.250
Like, I'm with it.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.620
Let's go. Come on.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.260
[Brooke Lynn]
Have you figured yours out yet?

13:26.260 --> 13:28.590
Yeah, I'm gonna make
the dress

13:28.590 --> 13:31.460
that Soju went home on,
but right.

13:31.460 --> 13:32.930
[laughs]

13:32.930 --> 13:35.730
'Cause the thing is, she had,
like, a decent silhouette.

13:35.730 --> 13:40.700
It's just she ruined it by not
executing that silhouette.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.410
[Yvie] This is really a chance
for me to show off my skill

13:43.410 --> 13:46.440
to turn alternative materials
into wearable clothing.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.880
This is my wheelhouse,

13:48.880 --> 13:50.610
and I feel like
if I can't shine at this,

13:50.610 --> 13:52.720
I can't shine
at any design challenge.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.380
[laughs]

13:54.380 --> 13:56.550
So I cannot make
the same silhouette.

13:56.550 --> 13:58.820
I know that
for a motherfucking fact.

13:58.820 --> 14:01.320
[Michelle] It's either a leotard
or a corset and a panty

14:01.320 --> 14:03.090
and some kind of pasty.

14:03.090 --> 14:05.560
I'm getting bored.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.800
Do you have a sketch for it?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.000
'Cause you know
I'll tell you lies, girl.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.400
Well, girl, come here,
Yvie, 'cause it--

14:09.400 --> 14:12.600
Bitch, right, you will tell me
the motherfucking truth.

14:12.600 --> 14:16.370
My drag aesthetic is Pretty
Woman, Rodeo Drive stripper.

14:16.370 --> 14:19.540
But I know if I walk down
that runway in a leotard,

14:19.540 --> 14:22.310
Michelle's going to slay me
Buffy style.

14:22.310 --> 14:24.710
I want to make something
out of all rope.

14:24.710 --> 14:26.380
-The whole top.
-Okay.

14:26.380 --> 14:27.680
And I want to add some rope
dangling from the sides

14:27.680 --> 14:29.120
off the shoulder.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.920
[Yvie] And then if you make
a more dramatic shape

14:30.920 --> 14:32.520
around the bottom, because
a lot of your stuff--

14:32.520 --> 14:33.620
-It's tight.
-Has been like tight.

14:33.620 --> 14:34.990
Yeah, girl, I think that's cute.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.760
Girl, at least she--you read me,

14:36.760 --> 14:40.400
but at least I come to you
to possibly read me again.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.500
[laughs]

14:45.700 --> 14:47.600
I was thinking
of like shucking the corn,

14:47.600 --> 14:49.510
and using that as fabric.

14:49.510 --> 14:51.810
[Yvie] I think that's actually
really creative.

14:51.810 --> 14:53.440
[Nina]
This is so hopeful for me.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.880
[laughs]

14:54.880 --> 14:57.150
My approach is to present
something really different

14:57.150 --> 14:58.610
from what the judges
have seen from me.

14:58.610 --> 15:01.020
I got some stretch fabric
to maybe create a base,

15:01.020 --> 15:02.890
especially for the top,
so it's fitted at the top.

15:02.890 --> 15:04.220
Yeah.

15:04.220 --> 15:06.420
But then to build off of that,
so it's like that.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.990
I think that's
a really cool idea.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.060
I'm inspired by this photo of Ru
in the workroom.

15:11.060 --> 15:13.360
It's important for me
to consider proportionizing

15:13.360 --> 15:15.060
because that's a critique
that I've gotten on the runway.

15:15.060 --> 15:17.930
And I want to show these judges
that I am listening

15:17.930 --> 15:19.270
and I'm trying
to better my drag.

15:19.270 --> 15:21.600
The execution
is going to be paramount.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.140
I don't want to float,
and I don't want to be safe.

15:23.140 --> 15:24.340
I want it to be exquisite.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.840
My runway is struggling.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.310
I didn't know I was
going to be this bad at it.

15:28.310 --> 15:30.650
So it's huge for me
to really fix this.

15:32.110 --> 15:35.280
Last time somebody came out
with corn, they went home.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.490
Shangie, shout out to you, boo.

15:39.560 --> 15:40.890
Hey, cysts.

15:40.890 --> 15:42.160
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.590
Is the farmer's daughter here?

15:44.590 --> 15:46.960
[all laugh]
I'm here.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.130
-Brooke Lynn Hytes.
-RuPaul.

15:49.130 --> 15:51.600
You are known as a design queen.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.800
You've got a lot
to live up to here.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.170
It's just so funny,
because back home

15:55.170 --> 15:57.070
I am not known
as a design queen at all.

15:57.070 --> 15:58.640
-Really?
-I'm the dancing queen.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.840
Now, I'm surprised.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.240
I thought you would be
a bigger personality.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.280
You're actually more subdued.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.510
[Brooke Lynn]
I am. My personality

16:05.510 --> 16:07.250
is not super loud
and in your face.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.050
I'm like an introverted
extrovert.

16:09.050 --> 16:10.620
No, I get it.
I'm the same way.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.090
But, you know,
I do have a point of view.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.820
I do have a sense of humor.

16:14.820 --> 16:17.060
-I like to act crazy.
-[laughs]

16:17.060 --> 16:18.390
Do you like to act crazy?

16:18.390 --> 16:19.660
I definitely think
I say my piece.

16:19.660 --> 16:22.830
I just think before
I have something to say.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.370
I want to be intelligent
about it.

16:24.370 --> 16:27.340
[RuPaul] Last week, I asked
the girls on the losing team

16:27.340 --> 16:28.700
who they think should go home.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.640
I'm gonna ask you
the same question.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.140
Who do you think should go home?

16:32.140 --> 16:34.210
Just speaking
off what I've seen

16:34.210 --> 16:37.880
and who's been in the lowest
category the most times,

16:37.880 --> 16:40.250
I'm going to go with Ra'Jah.
[RuPaul] Fair enough.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.450
You've gotten very far
on your aesthetic

16:42.450 --> 16:44.890
and your ability to dance.

16:44.890 --> 16:46.150
I want to see more personality
out of you.

16:46.150 --> 16:47.390
-Okay.
-I know it's there.

16:47.390 --> 16:50.330
I've seen you conjure it up
in the dancing.

16:50.330 --> 16:52.590
Give me and the people
at home watching it,

16:52.590 --> 16:54.830
an opportunity
to fall in love with you

16:54.830 --> 16:56.800
by some of the crunchy bits.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
-More vulnerability.
-Exactly.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.640
You know, that's
a hard thing for me to do.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.770
I used to be
a super emotional child.

17:02.770 --> 17:04.670
Like, I would cry at everything.

17:04.670 --> 17:06.980
And then I think as I got older,
I would get embarrassed

17:06.980 --> 17:09.580
and, like, kind of closed off,

17:09.580 --> 17:11.550
so I really
kind of became closed a lot.

17:11.550 --> 17:14.550
So--and I even, like, even now,

17:14.550 --> 17:15.920
I'm kind of tearing up
thinking about--

17:15.920 --> 17:20.490
talking about serious things
always makes me cry, so...

17:20.490 --> 17:23.230
Ha. It gives me anxiety
just thinking about it.

17:23.230 --> 17:24.490
Mm. Mm.

17:24.490 --> 17:25.760
Well, this may be an opportunity

17:25.760 --> 17:27.360
for you to really
work through that,

17:27.360 --> 17:29.830
and not judge it
or be ashamed of it.

17:29.830 --> 17:32.530
This is a unique situation
we're in right here.

17:32.530 --> 17:33.800
Completely.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.600
And everything's
going to come to the surface.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.070
Show people who you are.

17:38.070 --> 17:39.810
[A'Keria] Mama Ru ain't wrong.

17:39.810 --> 17:43.150
Brooke Lynn is sickening
on stage and boring off stage.

17:43.150 --> 17:47.150
She holds back because she has a
fear of actually being judged.

17:48.950 --> 17:50.920
-Hey, Ra'Jah.
-Hey, what's going on?

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
[RuPaul]
Another design challenge.

17:52.920 --> 17:57.090
I want to separate the real
badass bitches from the chaff.

17:57.090 --> 17:58.190
Okay.

17:58.190 --> 17:59.330
Are you chaff or are you wheat?

17:59.330 --> 18:01.230
I'm the good ass wheat.

18:01.230 --> 18:03.170
-[laughs]
-I'm that good ass wheat.

18:03.170 --> 18:04.430
You can make some cereal.

18:04.430 --> 18:06.440
You can get you some oats
and wheats, all of it.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.270
Okay, good. Now, we're working
with farm products,

18:08.270 --> 18:10.510
but I want
Seventh Avenue fashion.

18:10.510 --> 18:11.870
Can you give it to me?

18:11.870 --> 18:14.280
I'm actually working
on some designs now.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.410
-You sketch it out first?
-I always sketch it.

18:15.410 --> 18:17.980
I am super confident designing.

18:17.980 --> 18:19.610
All of my looks
usually I create.

18:19.610 --> 18:21.150
Seeing how everybody else

18:21.150 --> 18:23.320
is actually
just kind of hot gluing,

18:23.320 --> 18:26.220
I really want the judges
to know that I can construct,

18:26.220 --> 18:29.690
even in an organic,
unconventional challenge.

18:29.690 --> 18:32.090
I do have my go-to silhouettes,

18:32.090 --> 18:34.060
but I always want
to stretch myself

18:34.060 --> 18:35.360
outside of my comfort zone,

18:35.360 --> 18:37.800
especially when
there is a design challenge.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.030
It should be a challenge.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.000
It shouldn't just be,
you know, a corset.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.600
I'm shooting for winning.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.370
Good. All right.

18:44.370 --> 18:47.580
-I'll see you later, Ra'Jah.
-All right. See you later.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.140
-Hey, Plastique.
-Hi, Ru.

18:49.140 --> 18:52.010
I see you are at work here
on another design challenge.

18:52.010 --> 18:54.650
You know, I wanted to do
another design challenge

18:54.650 --> 18:57.990
to give you girls an opportunity
to really show your personality.

18:57.990 --> 18:59.450
Yes.

18:59.450 --> 19:01.260
And that's been something
you've been called out on.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.360
Yes, that has been.
I'm working on it.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.630
Is there something
you don't want us to see?

19:05.630 --> 19:07.930
Uh, you know, coming here,

19:07.930 --> 19:11.500
I had an idea of what America's
Next Drag Superstar should be.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.440
Like, should be
this polished individual

19:13.440 --> 19:16.510
who is always like that.

19:16.510 --> 19:20.780
Growing up, I--
it wasn't okay in my family

19:20.780 --> 19:24.210
to say whatever I want to say
or do whatever I want to do,

19:24.210 --> 19:28.880
because whoever I am
was not okay.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.050
Do they know you're here?

19:30.050 --> 19:31.350
No.

19:31.350 --> 19:32.550
Do they know
you are a performer?

19:32.550 --> 19:34.390
They do, they do,

19:34.390 --> 19:37.960
but it's not something that
we talk about in my family.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.930
Don't you owe it to them
to be yourself?

19:40.930 --> 19:44.200
I do, but in the past,

19:44.200 --> 19:48.470
when I tried to do that,
it didn't end up so well.

19:48.470 --> 19:49.500
Yeah.

19:49.500 --> 19:53.410
And I've seen a lot of,
you know,

19:53.410 --> 19:56.710
like, unhappiness
in my family...

20:00.950 --> 20:03.350
Resulting of me...

20:07.020 --> 20:11.060
Resulting of me
trying to come out of my shell

20:11.060 --> 20:12.430
and show them who I am.

20:12.430 --> 20:14.160
So...

20:14.160 --> 20:17.870
all I've known is to just
hide it away, you know.

20:17.870 --> 20:21.470
What can't be seen
can't hurt them, you know.

20:25.370 --> 20:26.640
[RuPaul]
This is an opportunity

20:26.640 --> 20:30.850
for you to show them in a way,

20:30.850 --> 20:34.780
on your own terms,

20:34.780 --> 20:38.450
you're beautiful and creative...

20:39.960 --> 20:43.690
and this is your gift to not
only them, but to yourself.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.200
Thank you.
Thank you.

20:54.770 --> 20:56.810
[sobs]

20:58.210 --> 21:01.610
-Show it. Show it.
-I will.

21:01.610 --> 21:05.750
The tears, the bits that you
may be ashamed of, do it here.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.120
This is your new home.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.880
I'm your new mommy.

21:08.880 --> 21:13.260
[cries]

21:13.260 --> 21:15.090
You'll always be my baby.

21:15.090 --> 21:17.730
I can't help but get emotional

21:17.730 --> 21:20.430
because a family
should celebrate and love

21:20.430 --> 21:22.260
what their son has become.

21:22.260 --> 21:23.930
Let me see it on that runway.

21:23.930 --> 21:25.200
I promise you I will.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.330
For someone who's,
quote, unquote,

21:26.330 --> 21:28.100
doesn't have a lot
of personality,

21:28.100 --> 21:31.010
she's really
putting herself out there

21:31.010 --> 21:33.980
in a very different way
than, say, Silky.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.180
I just find it very strange

21:42.180 --> 21:46.350
that in a walk-through
about personality,

21:46.350 --> 21:49.860
or lack thereof,
somehow correlates into

21:49.860 --> 21:52.660
your family not knowing
that you do drag,

21:52.660 --> 21:56.770
and that's the reason
why you have no personality?

22:02.600 --> 22:04.740
A'Keria C. Davenport.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.410
Hey, Mama Ru.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.680
What's that C. stand for?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.080
Chanel.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.180
Bitch, you better
bring some Chanel up in here.

22:10.180 --> 22:11.410
Chanel.

22:11.410 --> 22:12.850
It's a design challenge.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.880
-Ooh.
-Why you say it like that?

22:14.880 --> 22:16.790
It's just actually
coming up with that idea

22:16.790 --> 22:19.690
that puts me at the top
instead of just being safe.

22:19.690 --> 22:20.690
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

22:20.690 --> 22:22.390
So that's where my struggle is.

22:22.390 --> 22:25.590
As I look around the room, most
girls are covering corsets.

22:25.590 --> 22:29.100
So I'm going to dye
some burlap blue,

22:29.100 --> 22:32.630
then accent it
with it a peacock theme.

22:32.630 --> 22:36.240
Let's show the judges that
I can do different looks.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.110
Last week, I asked the girls
on the losing team

22:39.110 --> 22:40.310
who they think should go home.

22:40.310 --> 22:42.710
I'm gonna ask you
the same question.

22:42.710 --> 22:44.780
I'd probably
have to say Brooke.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.450
You've called her name more
than mine as a winner, so...

22:47.450 --> 22:48.650
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

22:48.650 --> 22:50.720
So you want to take out
the competition.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.020
Of course.

22:52.020 --> 22:54.720
Take these materials
and make something beautiful.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.060
-I sure will.
-Thanks.

22:57.060 --> 22:58.460
I'm definitely feeling
the pressure,

22:58.460 --> 23:02.130
because the judges do hold
pageant queens such as myself,

23:02.130 --> 23:05.300
Brooke Lynn, even Plastique
to a higher standard

23:05.300 --> 23:06.970
than the personality queens

23:06.970 --> 23:09.970
such as Yvie or Nina
or even Silky.

23:09.970 --> 23:11.240
They get a pass.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.410
But I finally got my win,

23:13.410 --> 23:15.240
and I need
to keep my streak going.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.880
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
What's the grease, Mama?

23:18.880 --> 23:20.320
[RuPaul] Well, you know,

23:20.320 --> 23:23.180
Michelle's been coming
for your ass with the leotard.

23:23.180 --> 23:24.590
What did you promise her?

23:24.590 --> 23:26.550
No more swimsuit, body suits.

23:26.550 --> 23:28.690
I ain't gonna wear them
even if they call my name

23:28.690 --> 23:30.590
when I look at them
in my suitcase

23:30.590 --> 23:32.360
and they're saying "put me on."

23:32.360 --> 23:33.430
I'm saying, no, bitch.

23:33.430 --> 23:35.060
[laughs]

23:35.060 --> 23:37.200
I guess there's certain things
I just like.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.070
I like that silhouette
'cause it looks good.

23:39.070 --> 23:41.840
Ain't nobody telling Michelle
to put her titties away.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.940
You know, 'cause she got
good titties, show 'em.

23:44.940 --> 23:46.570
But I'm up for the challenge.

23:46.570 --> 23:48.010
I ain't trying to go home,

23:48.010 --> 23:49.010
so Michelle, whatever you
want me to do, I'm gonna do it.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.010
I'm gonna try.

23:50.010 --> 23:51.750
So who do you think
should go home?

23:51.750 --> 23:54.250
Um...

23:54.250 --> 23:55.480
who's left?

23:55.480 --> 23:56.850
Bitch, you know who's left.

23:56.850 --> 23:58.120
I don't know.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.950
I want to remind your ass
this is a competition

23:59.950 --> 24:03.120
and I got a ride sharing
service on hold.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.790
I would say...

24:06.290 --> 24:09.600
Yvie, because she told me I
needed to change my silhouette.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.900
I don't know if she thought
she was the voice of reason.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.070
And you took offense to it.

24:13.070 --> 24:14.900
Yeah, because
I knew she was right.

24:14.900 --> 24:16.840
[Vanjie] Even though
Yvie was right,

24:16.840 --> 24:18.010
yeah, I'm being
a little sensitive.

24:18.010 --> 24:19.440
I'm not gonna lie, yes.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.140
Because, I mean, I haven't
been performing the best.

24:22.140 --> 24:23.140
I'm a returning queen,

24:23.140 --> 24:25.310
and I know
I need to win something.

24:25.310 --> 24:27.350
Y'all said if I named somebody,
they're going.

24:27.350 --> 24:28.650
It might be you, bitch.

24:28.650 --> 24:30.650
No! Why you go and say that?

24:30.650 --> 24:33.150
-[laughs]
-Don't put that juju over here.

24:33.150 --> 24:35.060
-Go over there with that.
-You get to work.

24:35.060 --> 24:36.060
I don't even know
what to think--

24:36.060 --> 24:37.530
I'm about to scratch everything.

24:37.530 --> 24:39.260
Well, you know, impress me.

24:39.260 --> 24:40.830
-Impress me.
-I will. I'ma try.

24:40.830 --> 24:42.160
All right.
I'll see you out there.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.640
-Dr. Silky Ganache.
-Hey, Ru.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.040
[RuPaul] Now, bitch,
this is a design challenge,

24:50.040 --> 24:53.270
and you've been getting by
on that personality of yours.

24:53.270 --> 24:54.710
-Oh, have I?
-You know that.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.610
I ain't telling you nothing
you don't already know.

24:57.610 --> 24:59.950
How you gonna make this work
for you in a design challenge?

24:59.950 --> 25:02.350
I'm stepping outside my box
once again.

25:02.350 --> 25:04.390
When did you step
outside your box?

25:04.390 --> 25:06.860
Last design challenge when I was
just too pretty apparently.

25:06.860 --> 25:09.120
Uh-huh. Bitch, but you
were in the bottom.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.690
You're going to have to bring it
on this design challenge.

25:12.690 --> 25:14.800
-I am.
-You said that last time.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.300
What are you going to do
different this time?

25:16.300 --> 25:18.630
I'm not making a gown,
which you'll be happy about.

25:18.630 --> 25:19.970
[RuPaul] No, it's not a gown.
I love gowns.

25:19.970 --> 25:22.800
It just has to be finished
in a way

25:22.800 --> 25:24.940
where the judges
are not going to say

25:24.940 --> 25:26.310
go back to the sewing machine.

25:26.310 --> 25:27.340
Right.

25:27.340 --> 25:28.740
I mean, did you hear that part?

25:28.740 --> 25:29.940
I did hear that part.

25:29.940 --> 25:34.050
I didn't agree with some parts.

25:34.050 --> 25:36.220
[RuPaul] But it's the judges'
opinion that really matters.

25:36.220 --> 25:37.720
[Silky] I know.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.020
So who do you think
should go home?

25:39.020 --> 25:40.890
I think Yvie should go home,

25:40.890 --> 25:44.260
just because she's hurt
and we ain't got time for that.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.160
Oh.

25:47.930 --> 25:50.300
[Yvie] That's like
a crock of bullshit.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.330
Silky just doesn't want
to look shady on TV

25:53.330 --> 25:56.170
and tell Ru that
she wants me to go home

25:56.170 --> 25:57.670
because she doesn't like me

25:57.670 --> 26:01.940
or the fact that I call her out,
which is the real reason.

26:01.940 --> 26:03.650
You have your work
cut out for you,

26:03.650 --> 26:04.950
'cause this shit

26:04.950 --> 26:07.080
gotta look like
it's on the New York runway.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.780
You'll see it.
I promise you.

26:08.780 --> 26:09.920
Okay. You--

26:09.920 --> 26:10.920
Or make me lip sync for my life.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.320
That's a guarantee for me.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.590
Okay, because you know
that's also a possibility.

26:15.590 --> 26:16.860
-I ain't afraid.
-Okay.

26:16.860 --> 26:18.360
All right, Dr. Ganache.

26:18.360 --> 26:22.360
I would love to see Miss Yvie
in a lip sync for your life.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.700
I'm gonna send that bitch
all the way back to Denver.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.900
Ready to.

26:27.900 --> 26:30.540
-Yvie Oddly.
-Howdy-ho.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.570
How's your ankle doing?

26:32.570 --> 26:33.780
I haven't had any complaints.

26:33.780 --> 26:35.210
Oh, good.
That's good to know.

26:35.210 --> 26:38.010
Is it going to keep you
out of the top spot this week?

26:38.010 --> 26:40.980
No. It's not my first time
spraining an ankle,

26:40.980 --> 26:43.180
and I usually bounce back
in a day or two.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.390
Good.

26:44.390 --> 26:45.920
I think if anybody's
worried about it,

26:45.920 --> 26:48.320
it should be my competitors,
because it goes away fast.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.490
[RuPaul] Ooh, oh, bitch.

26:49.490 --> 26:51.660
On that note, who do you think
should go home?

26:51.660 --> 26:53.030
Silky Ganache.

26:53.030 --> 26:54.500
[RuPaul] Why?

26:54.500 --> 26:57.470
I think Silky
has been the most resistant

26:57.470 --> 26:59.270
to your critiques
and the judges.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.200
Why you pressed, ho?

27:02.200 --> 27:04.340
Bitch, I was in the bottom
for being beautiful.

27:04.340 --> 27:06.940
A good problem to have
when you're me,

27:06.940 --> 27:09.280
and you can actually do makeup,
unlike that bitch,

27:09.280 --> 27:12.780
who couldn't serve you glam
a fucking day of her life.

27:12.780 --> 27:14.320
But I am a threat.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.050
America's gonna love me,

27:16.050 --> 27:18.320
and I think
that bitch knows that.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.490
[RuPaul] So now you have
a quirky style.

27:20.490 --> 27:22.390
How are you gonna translate that

27:22.390 --> 27:26.130
into a high fashion storyline
on the main stage?

27:26.130 --> 27:28.830
I do have so many
different sides of me,

27:28.830 --> 27:31.370
and I've sketched out
a silhouette

27:31.370 --> 27:33.300
that I haven't brought
to the judges yet.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.570
So I'm excited
to really nail home

27:35.570 --> 27:38.310
something that everyone in
Fashion Week would die to have.

27:38.310 --> 27:41.110
You guys are going to see
an entirely different Yvie.

27:41.110 --> 27:42.280
All right, Yvie.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.380
I can't wait to see
what you turn out.

27:43.380 --> 27:45.550
-Thank you, Ru.
-Thank you.

27:45.550 --> 27:47.480
[RuPaul] All right, ladies.
Gather round.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.720
Gather round, ladies.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.850
Oh, there's so few of you now.

27:50.850 --> 27:53.290
[all laugh]

27:53.290 --> 27:54.520
Now, in a moment,

27:54.520 --> 27:56.390
you'll be heading over
to the main stage

27:56.390 --> 27:59.190
where you'll meet
a mystery guest,

27:59.190 --> 28:00.860
who's going to give you
some pointers

28:00.860 --> 28:03.770
on your runway presentation.

28:03.770 --> 28:07.370
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

28:12.210 --> 28:13.410
[Shuga] Aah!

28:13.410 --> 28:14.740
Who could it be?

28:14.740 --> 28:18.110
-Oh, man.
-Yeah.

28:18.110 --> 28:20.580
Well, yippee-yi ki-yay.

28:20.580 --> 28:22.020
[cheers and applause]

28:22.020 --> 28:24.450
My mom. Aah!

28:24.450 --> 28:25.850
She's here.

28:25.850 --> 28:28.690
The one, the only,
Alyssa Edwards.

28:28.690 --> 28:29.790
All right.

28:29.790 --> 28:32.730
I came all the way
from Mesquite, Texas

28:32.730 --> 28:35.460
to give y'all
some runway pointers.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.900
Now, some people might think

28:37.900 --> 28:42.040
it doesn't require a lot of work
to look flawless on the runway.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.740
Well, think again.

28:43.740 --> 28:45.270
And that's why I'm here.

28:45.270 --> 28:47.240
Before I give y'all anything,
y'all let me know

28:47.240 --> 28:49.280
if my daughter over here,
Miss Plastique,

28:49.280 --> 28:50.680
has she been fucking up
over here?

28:50.680 --> 28:52.980
-Yes, she has.
-Where do we start?

28:52.980 --> 28:54.820
Before I got my tubes tied
after Laganja,

28:54.820 --> 28:56.250
I said I'm gonna do one more.

28:56.250 --> 28:57.620
[all laugh]

28:57.620 --> 28:59.720
But you know what, Plastique,
I got my eyes on you.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.960
Ain't gonna be no favoritism,
so you better turn it out today.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.730
I see you, Ma.
I see you.

29:03.730 --> 29:05.290
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna
go put your ass in the corner.

29:05.290 --> 29:06.560
[all laugh]

29:06.560 --> 29:07.930
All right,
why don't y'all show me

29:07.930 --> 29:09.960
what y'all got,
what y'all are working with.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.730
Everybody take a seat, please.

29:11.730 --> 29:13.670
And let's start
with Miss Vanjie.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.800
[Vanjie] Get the composition
notebook out.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.540
We're going to school, y'all.

29:17.540 --> 29:19.840
Now, I know you can walk
backwards, okay.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.110
Now I want to see you walk
forward and to the right,

29:22.110 --> 29:25.280
to the left, and go diagonal
if you are that girl.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.480
[Vanjie] I'm coming.
Pop the beat, please.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.990
[music plays]

29:30.990 --> 29:34.360
And I don't walk slow
like all the other ho's.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.720
You know, I like to pump
through and be ghetto.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.130
Hold on, Miss Vanjie, hold on.
You went too fast.

29:39.130 --> 29:40.730
I thought you was
running from the cops.

29:40.730 --> 29:43.060
You probably ran from the cops,
haven't you, Vanjie?

29:43.060 --> 29:44.230
[all laugh]

29:44.230 --> 29:45.830
This time, when you get
down stage here

29:45.830 --> 29:48.470
in the center, Miss Vanjie,
you look at all of them like,

29:48.470 --> 29:51.070
Ru, you know, honey, you was
wearing my name on your neck.

29:51.070 --> 29:53.880
Okay, take two.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.980
Okay, here she is.
She came out.

29:55.980 --> 29:59.050
She said y'all know me.
Still the same OG. Okay.

29:59.050 --> 30:00.920
Ain't shit changed
but the name on the mail.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.720
Ha! Okay, I like it.

30:03.720 --> 30:07.160
Ha! Okay, and then complete it.
Complete it.

30:07.160 --> 30:10.320
Now look at them.
That's it.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.990
[all laugh]
That's your character, right?

30:11.990 --> 30:13.130
Ha!

30:15.300 --> 30:17.800
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.840
Oh, it's serious and severe.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.700
I like
that she's on her relevé.

30:22.700 --> 30:24.310
Obviously, Brooke Lynn
is a dancer.

30:24.310 --> 30:26.870
Your technique is lovely,

30:26.870 --> 30:28.640
but what are you
really about, gal?

30:28.640 --> 30:31.750
See, for all of you,
your personality,

30:31.750 --> 30:35.380
that is what every judge
wants to see.

30:35.380 --> 30:37.320
So go back
and let's do it again.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.590
Sell your character,
because before you sell it,

30:39.590 --> 30:42.090
you've gotta buy it yourself.
Hit it.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.220
[music plays]

30:43.220 --> 30:44.860
Oh, now we're doing it.

30:44.860 --> 30:47.260
She's walking on air.

30:47.260 --> 30:49.260
Now crank up the personality
and the persona.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.600
There we go.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.230
And then she said
let me go ahead

30:52.230 --> 30:54.000
and give y'all
a little bit of shoulder.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.440
I need to know
where you're going,

30:55.440 --> 30:57.640
not just on this runway,
but in life.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.110
What is your character?

30:59.110 --> 31:00.710
Oh, and that's the way
she's going.

31:00.710 --> 31:02.110
[all laugh]

31:02.110 --> 31:03.480
Nina West.

31:03.480 --> 31:07.050
She does crossfit.
Yep, that's her.

31:07.050 --> 31:09.020
[all laugh]

31:09.020 --> 31:13.150
Oh, this is very pleasing.

31:13.150 --> 31:15.190
She says look at the back,
no back rolls.

31:15.190 --> 31:16.560
Ehh.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.030
A little bit.
[all laugh]

31:19.030 --> 31:22.130
Crank it up.
Crank it to the left.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.100
Crank it like--
you want to go that way?

31:24.100 --> 31:27.370
Crank it up this way, that way,
forward, back, who cares?

31:27.370 --> 31:28.370
Look at me.

31:28.370 --> 31:29.900
Jacqueline Smith for Kmart.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.370
[all laugh]

31:31.370 --> 31:33.610
[Alyssa] I wanna see
a little Shuga in that tank.

31:33.610 --> 31:34.880
Hit it.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.280
Punch it, girl.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.280
Oh, she's obviously
selling that ass.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.480
[all laugh]

31:39.480 --> 31:42.120
Got more legs
than a bucket of chicken.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.290
-Two of them.
-Two of them.

31:44.290 --> 31:45.290
[all laugh]

31:45.290 --> 31:47.690
Not chartreuse, but Silky.

31:47.690 --> 31:49.820
Okay.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.030
Hold it, hold it.
Girl, hold that pose.

31:52.030 --> 31:54.430
Let them get up in that mug
and that body.

31:54.430 --> 31:56.700
No, you ain't gotta do
all that.

31:56.700 --> 31:57.900
Let your eyes do it for you.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.700
Don't turn into
the sign language.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.300
You ain't no flight attendant.

32:01.300 --> 32:03.870
Oh, oh, there it is.

32:03.870 --> 32:06.210
Let 'em digest it, girl.
And now go.

32:07.640 --> 32:12.010
Okay, this fantasy
is interesting.

32:14.050 --> 32:16.980
[all laugh]

32:16.980 --> 32:19.720
[Alyssa] If I could describe
my spirit animal,

32:19.720 --> 32:21.590
that might be Miss Silky.

32:23.460 --> 32:25.060
Hold on, what was that?
Tell me what that was.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.190
That looked like an orgasm.

32:26.190 --> 32:28.800
I wanted them
to get all this ganache.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.630
What does that mean?

32:30.630 --> 32:33.500
Get all this ganache.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.040
[all laugh]

32:36.040 --> 32:38.470
This bitch is for real.

32:38.470 --> 32:40.310
I'm gonna get you
with this one, though.

32:40.310 --> 32:42.580
I got all the ganache.
Don't worry about it.

32:42.580 --> 32:44.950
I got it--Oh.

32:44.950 --> 32:46.450
Don't you break the set, bitch.

32:46.450 --> 32:48.120
You'll be going all the way back
to where you came from.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.950
[all laugh]

32:49.950 --> 32:52.420
Plastique, girl,
if you come around that corner

32:52.420 --> 32:56.320
and have me act like a stage mom
from Toddlers and Tiaras.

32:56.320 --> 32:59.030
[all laugh]

32:59.030 --> 33:00.960
Oh, barefooted.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.100
I love it. We've gone
over this a lot, bitch.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.830
Now, Plastique, what...

33:06.830 --> 33:10.070
[all laugh]

33:10.070 --> 33:14.010
See, a smart gal
right there, honey.

33:14.010 --> 33:16.240
When did this Plastique
clock in for this shift?

33:16.240 --> 33:18.710
Did somebody order

33:18.710 --> 33:21.850
a extra side of extra-ness?

33:21.850 --> 33:23.750
[Alyssa] Come on, bat your eyes.

33:23.750 --> 33:25.650
Do it like we do at the house
for the pageant.

33:25.650 --> 33:26.890
Okay, not too crazy now.

33:26.890 --> 33:28.090
[all laugh]

33:28.090 --> 33:29.560
I am very proud of Plastique.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.730
I just knew she was going
to buckle when she saw me,

33:31.730 --> 33:33.060
and she didn't.

33:33.060 --> 33:36.000
And that lets me know
that she is ready for this.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.600
Oh, y'all thought I was done.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.100
Aah!

33:39.100 --> 33:41.170
Oh!

33:41.170 --> 33:43.100
Okay, she's disqualified.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.970
[all laugh]
Ma!

33:44.970 --> 33:48.740
Last but certainly not least,

33:48.740 --> 33:52.310
the oddest,
not Stevie, but Yvie.

33:52.310 --> 33:55.020
[gasps]
Oh, she's got flexibility.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.320
Oh, look at that. Okay.

33:57.320 --> 33:59.020
Oh.

33:59.020 --> 34:01.120
All right, Miss Yvie.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.920
Gumby's sister.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.190
Oh, she's doing yoga class.
All right.

34:05.190 --> 34:07.230
And now she's punching.

34:07.230 --> 34:08.300
This bitch has got
to get to the bus stop.

34:08.300 --> 34:10.200
[all laugh]

34:10.200 --> 34:11.530
Let's don't say that.
Rewind back. Let's--

34:11.530 --> 34:13.200
I don't want Roxxxy
sending me a tweet.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.970
[all laugh]

34:15.970 --> 34:17.200
Uh-oh.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.710
Now, Yvie, I want
to see you in drag.

34:18.710 --> 34:19.910
I'm into all of this.

34:19.910 --> 34:21.810
[Vanjie] She nasty.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.080
She is on her way
to the Olympics.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.410
Oh, girl,
we just came from there.

34:25.410 --> 34:27.280
You did?
[all laugh]

34:27.280 --> 34:29.050
What is that blue tape?

34:29.050 --> 34:32.490
Oh, see, that's
for a sprained ankle.

34:32.490 --> 34:34.120
But I just wanted
to show the girls

34:34.120 --> 34:35.860
that you can
push through things,

34:35.860 --> 34:38.730
as long as you're not
pushing past your limit.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.230
[Silky] Really, bitch?

34:43.760 --> 34:46.430
-Thank you, Yvie.
-Thank you.

34:46.430 --> 34:48.940
[light applause]

34:48.940 --> 34:50.940
Send me home
'cause I'm injured.

34:53.740 --> 34:58.010
So my ankle is definitely not
happy that I did all of that,

34:58.010 --> 35:01.320
but like I'm really pissed
that Silky would say that

35:01.320 --> 35:03.650
as a bullshit excuse
to send me home,

35:03.650 --> 35:06.450
especially when she saw me
finish that last challenge

35:06.450 --> 35:08.720
on a sprained ankle.

35:11.430 --> 35:13.890
Now, y'all know I didn't
come all the way over here

35:13.890 --> 35:17.470
just to be nobody's
Miss Jay runway coach.

35:17.470 --> 35:19.030
[all laugh]

35:19.030 --> 35:21.600
So I got a surprise for y'all.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.270
And for Ru.

35:23.270 --> 35:25.170
Y'all know Ru loves
his country breakfast,

35:25.170 --> 35:27.840
so we're gonna teach y'all
a little jig, honey,

35:27.840 --> 35:29.340
to entertain her in the morning

35:29.340 --> 35:32.580
while she snacks up
on her chicken and biscuits.

35:32.580 --> 35:35.120
Girl, I don't know how
to country line dance.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.390
I don't know what this shit
is going to be.

35:37.390 --> 35:38.820
[Vanjie] This is too much
pressure.

35:38.820 --> 35:42.320
Make an outfit.
Now do choreography.

35:42.320 --> 35:47.030
[Alyssa] I'm gonna call this
group RuPaul's Pumpkin Pies.

35:47.030 --> 35:48.530
Oh, Jesus, Lord, help us all.

35:52.230 --> 35:53.570
[rooster crows]

35:53.570 --> 35:57.240
Yee-haw!
[laughs]

35:57.240 --> 35:59.140
Ride 'em, cowboy.

35:59.140 --> 36:01.640
Lotta ass. Ooh.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.010
Today is elimination day.

36:03.010 --> 36:06.080
Not only do we have a design
challenge farm-to-runway,

36:06.080 --> 36:09.180
but we also have to perform
live, in front of the judges,

36:09.180 --> 36:12.450
a country line dance
called Pumpkin Pies.

36:12.450 --> 36:13.620
What are you going to do
with this?

36:13.620 --> 36:15.060
-Girl.
-Slick my hair up.

36:15.060 --> 36:16.890
You want to brush it first,
though, right?

36:16.890 --> 36:18.730
Should I?

36:18.730 --> 36:20.630
I don't know about this, honey.

36:20.630 --> 36:22.500
I'm not good with hair.
Never been good with hair.

36:22.500 --> 36:25.630
I call Silky's boy hair
can't-you, don't-you.

36:25.630 --> 36:27.200
Can't you comb it,
don't you try.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.470
Can't do nothing with it.

36:29.470 --> 36:31.140
It's Sonic the Hedgehog good.

36:31.140 --> 36:33.840
Silky, why do you not know how
to brush your own hair, though?

36:33.840 --> 36:35.440
I'm terrible, girl.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.310
And she talking about
I'm gonna so win.

36:37.310 --> 36:38.980
It'll be nappy in two days.

36:38.980 --> 36:41.620
So, A'Keria, girl, did you
end up switching yours up?

36:41.620 --> 36:43.820
I switched mine up completely.

36:43.820 --> 36:47.350
Like I had to
because it was a disaster.

36:47.350 --> 36:50.560
Girl. So last night
I dyed my burlap

36:50.560 --> 36:53.060
with organic dye
that did not work.

36:53.060 --> 36:55.600
And so I had to create
a new look

36:55.600 --> 36:57.060
with this denim fabric I found.

36:57.060 --> 36:59.230
I mean, I'm a little iffy on it,

36:59.230 --> 37:02.600
only because I just feel
like it's too plain.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.110
Of course, it's not
one of my best,

37:04.110 --> 37:06.610
but I always give over the top,
over the top.

37:06.610 --> 37:11.010
Maybe the judges will appreciate
the less is more side of me.

37:11.010 --> 37:13.310
Well, you know, I had to switch
my look up a little bit

37:13.310 --> 37:14.920
because I really wanted to show

37:14.920 --> 37:16.250
that I can work
with organic materials

37:16.250 --> 37:18.820
and still make it look
like it walks off the runway,

37:18.820 --> 37:20.690
as opposed to like
arts and crafts.

37:20.690 --> 37:22.460
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

37:22.460 --> 37:25.230
I changed my idea
because in the process

37:25.230 --> 37:28.430
of Plastique stealing
all of my fucking material,

37:28.430 --> 37:32.570
it was like, okay,

37:32.570 --> 37:34.870
so now you gotta figure
something else out.

37:34.870 --> 37:37.440
I was the one who
originally pulled tree bark.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.710
As I was working,

37:38.710 --> 37:42.140
I look and I only have
three pieces of bark left.

37:42.140 --> 37:45.550
I'm like, so Plastique, did you
use those pieces of bark?

37:45.550 --> 37:47.820
She was like, oh, I did.

37:47.820 --> 37:49.550
Well, bitch,
why are you putting my shit

37:49.550 --> 37:52.420
on your garment
in the first place?

37:52.420 --> 37:55.160
But I'm the bigger person

37:55.160 --> 37:56.790
So I decided
I'm going to give them

37:56.790 --> 38:01.000
a sickening pair
of motherfucking pants, burlap.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.600
Who would ever think

38:02.600 --> 38:06.630
to make a pair of pants
out of a potato sack?

38:06.630 --> 38:07.740
[clicks tongue]

38:07.740 --> 38:09.840
Those pants, girl.
The tailor on the pants.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.140
I'm like, bitch.

38:11.140 --> 38:12.740
[Ra'Jah] I hope the judges
really respond

38:12.740 --> 38:14.110
to the fact
that I actually, like,

38:14.110 --> 38:16.410
took my time
and crafted something nice.

38:18.450 --> 38:20.410
[all laugh]
Shady lady.

38:20.410 --> 38:23.250
[Shuga] No, no, no!

38:26.590 --> 38:29.190
[Ra'Jah] So, Yvie,
is your leg feeling better?

38:29.190 --> 38:32.190
It definitely is.
I'm like at 90%.

38:32.190 --> 38:34.090
I think some rest
and some time off of it

38:34.090 --> 38:35.460
was really all it needed.

38:35.460 --> 38:37.870
Girl, that walk through
healed you right on up.

38:37.870 --> 38:39.370
Oh, my God.

38:39.370 --> 38:40.630
Bitch, when she said Miss Yvie,
'cause she's sick.

38:40.630 --> 38:44.000
She said, oh, not on tonight.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.310
Sporting a fever, baby.

38:46.310 --> 38:47.710
That's part of the reason

38:47.710 --> 38:48.880
I don't like showing
a lot of that physical weakness

38:48.880 --> 38:50.380
that I go through every day,

38:50.380 --> 38:52.280
'cause I think bitches
will take it for weakness.

38:52.280 --> 38:55.350
And if you think that
I'm too sick to be here,

38:55.350 --> 38:56.750
you've got
another thing coming.

38:56.750 --> 39:01.520
'Cause the only type of sick
she is is sickening.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.790
[Shuga] Eew.
[all laugh]

39:03.790 --> 39:05.730
I ain't gonna agree to that,
but, yeah.

39:05.730 --> 39:08.900
[all laugh]

39:11.630 --> 39:14.500
Well, girl, we all know
someone has to leave tonight.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.370
Whoever you are, you plan on
leaving Silky some hair?

39:17.370 --> 39:20.310
[Yvie] What happens
if Silky departs?

39:20.310 --> 39:21.640
Does she have to leave us
some hair?

39:21.640 --> 39:23.180
[Shuga]
No, she can take it.

together beautifully.

It's time
for the judges' critiques,

47:25.330 --> 47:29.930
starting with Yvie Oddly.

47:29.930 --> 47:33.470
Your use of all of the organic
materials was perfect.

47:33.470 --> 47:36.170
And the colors
were amazing to me.

47:36.170 --> 47:38.040
[Amber] You were giving
fall in Hawaii,

47:38.040 --> 47:40.410
which doesn't exist,
which is even more genius.

47:40.410 --> 47:43.240
There's a real quirkiness
to you, and I love that.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.910
[Ross] There's a taste level
tonight,

47:44.910 --> 47:47.910
but you're not losing
any of Yvie in this.

47:47.910 --> 47:52.050
You're finding a really nice way
of staying true to who you are.

47:52.050 --> 47:55.820
If you can keep this formula up,
the future looks bright for you.

47:55.820 --> 47:56.890

48:00.590 --> 48:03.500
The details
with the trim on the shoe,

48:03.500 --> 48:05.830
and the bag is major
because it's an oversize,

48:05.830 --> 48:07.470
which is really in fashion
right now.

48:07.470 --> 48:09.170
[Kandi]
And then the whole back thing.

48:09.170 --> 48:11.200
Honey, that's everything.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.910
[all laugh]

48:12.910 --> 48:14.470
[Ross] You look like someone
who's comfortable

48:14.470 --> 48:16.640
with a frontrunner status,
'cause you've been killing it.

48:16.640 --> 48:17.980
Thank you.

48:17.980 --> 48:19.650
[Ross] It's funny,
when you set a bar,

48:19.650 --> 48:21.980
you have to like stay
at that level now,

48:21.980 --> 48:23.480
-or we're disappointed.
-Yeah.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.020
-But you're keeping it up.
-Thank you.

48:25.020 --> 48:26.250
Well, thank you.

48:26.250 --> 48:28.490
Up next, Plastique Tiara.

48:28.490 --> 48:30.090
I love this outfit.

48:30.090 --> 48:32.530
It reminds me of a
Brooke Shields Vanity Fair cover

48:32.530 --> 48:35.330
from November of 1984.

48:35.330 --> 48:36.330
Absolutely gorgeous.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.100
Coming from the runway,

48:38.100 --> 48:41.370
designers want you to emote
if you're the clothing,

48:41.370 --> 48:43.500
and I really got that from you.

48:43.500 --> 48:45.510
[Ross] In the pumpkin pie
number,

48:45.510 --> 48:46.970
I don't think I've ever
seen you have that much fun

48:46.970 --> 48:47.970
since the acting challenge.

48:47.970 --> 48:49.780
Yeah, I really, really did.

48:49.780 --> 48:51.510
The talk you had with me
in the workroom

48:51.510 --> 48:52.580
meant so much to me.

48:52.580 --> 48:54.180
And then I saw Alyssa,

48:54.180 --> 48:55.780
and it just motivated me
even more.

48:55.780 --> 48:58.220
-You all believed in me.
-Yeah.

48:58.220 --> 49:00.190
So I don't have anything
to hold back at this point.

49:00.190 --> 49:04.090
[RuPaul] Well, you have Alyssa,
and now you have us.

49:04.090 --> 49:07.130
And that's what we get to do
as gay people.

49:07.130 --> 49:10.000
We get to find our tribe
who can support us.

49:10.000 --> 49:10.930
Thank you.

49:12.300 --> 49:14.330
Up next, Ra'Jah O'Hara.

49:14.330 --> 49:18.070
-Your makeup is stun-ning.
-Thank you so much.

49:18.070 --> 49:19.810
Let's talk about
the pumpkin pie number.

49:19.810 --> 49:23.510
That was a big
personality challenge.

49:23.510 --> 49:25.850
I lost you a little bit.

49:25.850 --> 49:28.880
Tonight on the runway,
I am seeing Groot.

49:30.380 --> 49:32.450
[Ra'Jah] I really
wanted to tell a story.

49:32.450 --> 49:34.920
I've been in the bottom
a couple of times,

49:34.920 --> 49:39.060
and I felt like a tree
that has been uprooted

49:39.060 --> 49:40.460
in a burlap bag,

49:40.460 --> 49:43.630
and my bark, because I am
stronger than I thought I was.

49:43.630 --> 49:47.230
And I'm still blossoming.

49:47.230 --> 49:48.700
That's where the green comes in.

49:48.700 --> 49:51.270
And then my headdress
is my crown.

49:51.270 --> 49:54.610
It doesn't suck, but there's
ways it could be better.

49:54.610 --> 49:56.640
I just hated the headpiece.

49:56.640 --> 49:59.710
That took away
from the top to me.

49:59.710 --> 50:01.850
And the trousers,
they were coming apart, right?

50:01.850 --> 50:06.690
It's a bold move
to make a pant out of burlap.

50:06.690 --> 50:09.390
But I appreciate a big swing.

50:11.190 --> 50:12.830
Up next, A'Keria.

50:12.830 --> 50:14.590
That hairline is kind of hard.

50:14.590 --> 50:17.160
And the shoulder pads,
I hated them.

50:17.160 --> 50:20.500
They were giving me, like,
old school, you know, like--

50:20.500 --> 50:22.440
What's wrong with shoulder pads?

50:22.440 --> 50:24.440
Come on, now.
You're giving me linebacker.

50:24.440 --> 50:27.240
Now, the idea of this shape
is not bad.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.210
What happened was
your shoulders rose so high

50:29.210 --> 50:31.650
that it was almost like
a little bit of hunchback.

50:31.650 --> 50:34.110
And I missed your arms.

50:34.110 --> 50:36.350
And then--oh, there they are.

50:36.350 --> 50:38.180
Now, that would have been
a good thing

50:38.180 --> 50:39.390
to look at in the mirror to see

50:39.390 --> 50:40.850
am I showing
all my best assets.

50:40.850 --> 50:42.390
[Michelle] Tonight on the runway

50:42.390 --> 50:43.520
everything that I'm
used to seeing you do

50:43.520 --> 50:45.390
kind of took a step back
this week.

50:46.890 --> 50:49.060
Up next, Nina West.

50:49.060 --> 50:52.900
Representing corn. Corn?

50:52.900 --> 50:54.230
When did I eat corn?

50:54.230 --> 50:58.240
This look tonight,
I'm still digesting this,

50:58.240 --> 50:59.840
like when you eat corn.

50:59.840 --> 51:01.510
[laughs]

51:01.510 --> 51:03.510
[Ross] The top
really worked for me.

51:03.510 --> 51:04.840
It's the proportion
on the bottom.

51:04.840 --> 51:08.110
It looks like
it's some saggy drawers.

51:08.110 --> 51:09.980
[Michelle] Your body shape's
still a little off.

51:09.980 --> 51:13.620
Now we got the booty,
we need to round out the hips.

51:13.620 --> 51:16.820
Your makeup, warm up your base.

51:16.820 --> 51:18.990
You could soften up the eye,

51:18.990 --> 51:21.330
because you have
a really pretty face.

51:21.330 --> 51:22.800
You could show that more.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.200
[Ross] I know you've been
doing drag a long time,

51:24.200 --> 51:26.030
but if you can fine tune this,

51:26.030 --> 51:29.440
you could take your drag
to a whole other level.

51:29.440 --> 51:31.200
I want to know
and I want to be better,

51:31.200 --> 51:32.870
so I'm really grateful
for this.

51:34.570 --> 51:37.610
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

51:37.610 --> 51:40.280
While you un-shuck backstage,

51:40.280 --> 51:42.550
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:43.880 --> 51:47.290
All right, just between
us squirrel friends,

51:47.290 --> 51:51.120
what do you think?
Starting with Yvie Oddly.

51:51.120 --> 51:53.230
I loved her act on the hay bale.

51:53.230 --> 51:56.360
I thought she was hilarious,

51:56.360 --> 51:58.930
and her attention to detail
was great in her dress.

51:58.930 --> 52:00.800
[RuPaul] The color combination
was really beautiful,

52:00.800 --> 52:02.540
and I loved
the finger waves on her.

52:02.540 --> 52:06.370
It was an oddly softer side
of Yvie, and I liked it.

52:06.370 --> 52:09.880
[Ross] Yvie came here with a
very unique way of doing drag,

52:09.880 --> 52:11.810
and now she's
going into this place

52:11.810 --> 52:13.910
where she's giving us
some glamour,

52:13.910 --> 52:15.720
which looks really good on her.

52:15.720 --> 52:19.290
Yvie is progressing
every week.

52:19.290 --> 52:20.290
That's exciting.

52:20.290 --> 52:22.220
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

52:22.220 --> 52:24.420
For me, Brooke Lynn
is a lot of perfection.

52:24.420 --> 52:27.430
She put together the denim
beautifully.

52:27.430 --> 52:30.360
Her dress was the most
street-worthy.

52:30.360 --> 52:31.360
She knows what she's doing.

52:31.360 --> 52:34.070
Yeah. Brooke Lynn
is here to win.

52:34.070 --> 52:36.000
It just gave me my life
sitting here.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.600
[Ross] But she didn't
make me laugh

52:37.600 --> 52:39.440
during the pumpkin pie
hoe-down.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.440
There were other queens
out there

52:40.440 --> 52:41.670
with their teeth blacked out,

52:41.670 --> 52:43.910
really hyuh-hyuh, hyuh-hyuh,
going for it.

52:43.910 --> 52:45.650
and she didn't do that.

52:45.650 --> 52:49.650
She was a great dancer,
but not hilarious.

52:49.650 --> 52:50.850
Like a step aerobics teacher.

52:50.850 --> 52:52.220
Well, I've never been,
but sounds great.

52:52.220 --> 52:53.620
[all laugh]

52:53.620 --> 52:55.490
[RuPaul] Plastique Tiara.

52:55.490 --> 52:56.920
The design tonight was great.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.290
Yeah, very couture.

52:58.290 --> 53:01.360
She was giving me
woodland faerie, ballerina.

53:01.360 --> 53:04.400
And her walk.
Did y'all not pay attention

53:04.400 --> 53:08.400
to how slow and sultry she was
coming down that runway.

53:08.400 --> 53:09.670
She was giving me everything.

53:09.670 --> 53:11.370
[RuPaul] During
the walk-through, she confessed

53:11.370 --> 53:14.370
she comes from a very strict
Vietnamese family

53:14.370 --> 53:17.210
who doesn't really understand

53:17.210 --> 53:19.910
why little boys
would want to do drag.

53:19.910 --> 53:22.050
[Amber] And to have the courage
to go ahead

53:22.050 --> 53:24.150
and do what she believes in
is so commendable.

53:24.150 --> 53:26.820
And that makes her
even more beautiful.

53:26.820 --> 53:28.690
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

53:28.690 --> 53:31.930
Ra'Jah, for me,
was gone in Pumpkin Pie.

53:31.930 --> 53:34.260
Like I forgot she was even
in this competition.

53:34.260 --> 53:38.430
But I loved where she was trying
to go tonight on the runway.

53:38.430 --> 53:40.030
The story she talks about

53:40.030 --> 53:41.970
how she's the tree that's been
dug up and wrapped in burlap--

53:41.970 --> 53:43.870
Yeah, but, bitch,
you didn't get that story.

53:43.870 --> 53:45.140
She had to tell you.

53:45.140 --> 53:46.570
[Amber] But the fact
that she wore pants

53:46.570 --> 53:48.370
was very different.

53:48.370 --> 53:52.150
Mind you, it was an ABC:
another bad creation.

53:52.150 --> 53:54.080
They were falling apart
in the crotch,

53:54.080 --> 53:55.720
the seams were wide open,

53:55.720 --> 53:57.050
and then these white shoes,

53:57.050 --> 53:58.620
it just made no sense to me.

53:58.620 --> 54:00.320
Ru, do you ever bake?

54:00.320 --> 54:01.550
In my lovin' oven.

54:01.550 --> 54:02.560
[laughs]

54:02.560 --> 54:03.990
Sometimes in my Dutch oven.

54:03.990 --> 54:06.260
-Ooh.
-Well, sometimes you check

54:06.260 --> 54:08.160
to see if something's done,
and it's not done yet.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.630
I feel like
that's where Ra'Jah is.

54:10.630 --> 54:13.700
I just wish I could set
the timer for a little longer.

54:13.700 --> 54:15.900
[RuPaul] Let's move on
to A'Keria.

54:15.900 --> 54:18.370
For me, A'Keria is a power
hitter in this competition.

54:18.370 --> 54:19.910
And then she came out
on the runway tonight,

54:19.910 --> 54:21.940
it was like where's my A'Keria?

54:21.940 --> 54:24.410
[Ross] Tonight is just
such a big miss.

54:24.410 --> 54:26.150
The dress just swallowed her up.

54:26.150 --> 54:28.580
[Kandi] And those
shoulder pads, honey.

54:28.580 --> 54:30.350
It ruined the illusion for me.

54:30.350 --> 54:32.450
It just felt like she was
ready to tackle somebody.

54:32.450 --> 54:35.660
And I wish they would have
tackled her right off the stage.

54:35.660 --> 54:37.990
[all laugh]
I just wasn't into it.

54:37.990 --> 54:39.260
Sorry.

54:39.260 --> 54:41.900
[RuPaul] Our corny Nina West.

54:41.900 --> 54:43.230
[all laugh]
Aw, shucks.

54:43.230 --> 54:45.060
I love that little corn puff.

54:45.060 --> 54:47.030
She's so eager to do well.

54:47.030 --> 54:48.470
[Michelle]
I appreciate the fact

54:48.470 --> 54:51.740
that she's trying to do
the padding that I suggested.

54:51.740 --> 54:53.840
Tonight, her body
looked much better,

54:53.840 --> 54:55.580
and I was proud
of the aesthetic.

54:55.580 --> 54:58.010
I actually liked what she did
with the corn husks.

54:58.010 --> 55:01.280
And she wasn't afraid
to be ugly and quirky.

55:01.280 --> 55:05.080
It's really important to play
different sides and entertain.

55:05.080 --> 55:07.950
But is she America's
Next Drag Superstar?

55:07.950 --> 55:11.720
Well, we still have yet
to see that in Nina.

55:11.720 --> 55:13.560
I hope Nina
gets to stick around,

55:13.560 --> 55:16.560
because she is elevating
her game.

55:16.560 --> 55:20.170
And if she gets it,
watch out for Nina.

55:20.170 --> 55:23.440
Silence.
I've made my decision.

55:24.700 --> 55:28.980
Bring back my girls.

55:28.980 --> 55:31.110
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

55:31.110 --> 55:32.680
I've made some decisions.

55:35.820 --> 55:40.690
Yvie, oddly,
you've never looked lovelier.

55:40.690 --> 55:44.890
Brooke Lynn Hytes,
in this competition,

55:44.890 --> 55:47.860
you're using your head
and your ass.

55:49.360 --> 55:53.030
Plastique Tiara, this week
was your breakthrough.

55:55.670 --> 55:59.340
Plastique Tiara...

55:59.340 --> 56:00.640
Con-drag-ulations.

56:00.640 --> 56:02.680
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

56:02.680 --> 56:06.150
[cheers and applause]

56:06.150 --> 56:07.480
Thank you.

56:07.480 --> 56:09.680
You've won
a five night trip to Toronto,

56:09.680 --> 56:13.050
courtesy of Tourism Toronto.

56:13.050 --> 56:15.460
I finally won!

56:15.460 --> 56:17.390
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

56:17.390 --> 56:22.200
I've been in the top so many
times, so to win feels so good.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.260
So, so good.

56:29.070 --> 56:31.640
Ra'Jah O'Hara,

56:31.640 --> 56:34.470
your organic look
was undercooked.

56:34.470 --> 56:37.980
A'Keria C. Davenport,

56:37.980 --> 56:41.350
your denim look
gave the judges the blues.

56:43.120 --> 56:45.120
Nina West,

56:45.120 --> 56:48.990
your corn look
did not a-maize the judges.

56:52.790 --> 56:54.160
Nina West...

56:57.000 --> 56:58.130
You are safe.

57:01.570 --> 57:02.770
You may join the other girls.

57:02.770 --> 57:05.040
Thank you.

57:06.840 --> 57:10.680
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah, A'Keria,
I'm sorry, my dears,

57:10.680 --> 57:12.850
but you are up for elimination.

57:12.850 --> 57:15.950
[Ra'Jah] To know that
I'm in the bottom again...

57:18.180 --> 57:19.420
I'm like devastated.

57:19.420 --> 57:21.820
But I'm just continuing
to fight.

57:21.820 --> 57:25.090
[RuPaul] Two queens
stand before me.

57:25.090 --> 57:30.030
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:30.030 --> 57:33.430
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:35.670 --> 57:37.470
