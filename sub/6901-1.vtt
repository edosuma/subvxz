lf l wear a mask, l can fool the world

But l cannot fool my heart

01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:51.419
Who is that girl l see

Staring straight back at me?

01:24:56.341 --> 01:25:01.971
When will my reflection show

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:07.560
Who I am inside?

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:10.980
I am now

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:16.194
In a worId where
l have to hide my heart

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:18.780
And what I beIieve in

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:20.948

Staring straight back at me?

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:47.809
Why is my reflection

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:53.648
Someone I don't know?

01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:59.111

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:20.716
To fly

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:22.927
And I burn

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.972
With a need to know

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:31.519
The reason why

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:36.691
Why must we all conceal

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:41.153
What we think, how we feel?

01:26:41.238 --> 01:26:45.908
Must there be a secret me

01:26:45.993 --> 01:26:50.997
I'm forced to hide?

01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:56.460

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:12.018
Who I am inside?

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:19.650
When will my reflection show

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:23.821
