[exhales]

00:42.793 --> 00:44.633
[Jean] <i> This is not just a story.</i>

00:46.797 --> 00:48.297
<i>This really happened.</i>

00:59.101 --> 01:00.691
<i>He took me to her body.</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:07.944
I know that I saw her.
I know that I saw her.

01:10.279 --> 01:14.239
<i>And yet...</i>
<i>I've spent a lot of years asking:</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:17.325
<i>"Why don't I have all the pieces?</i>

01:20.622 --> 01:22.962
<i>Why didn't I do anything?"</i>

01:27.462 --> 01:29.762
<i>Knowing she's laying out somewhere.</i>

01:34.052 --> 01:36.182
<i>After Cathy Cesnik died...</i>

01:37.472 --> 01:39.562
he now had me hook, line and sinker.

01:43.103 --> 01:47.823
<i>And now the abuse became worse</i>
<i>than it had ever been.</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:54.528
<i>There's a certain thing</i>
<i>that you do in order to survive,</i>

01:54.615 --> 01:56.615
<i>and that is, you leave it where it's at.</i>

01:58.285 --> 02:01.495
You can't think it,
you can't look at it, you can't--

02:01.955 --> 02:04.705
You can't do anything with it, because...

02:05.584 --> 02:07.674
Except sever it away, put it in a box.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.221
<i>I'm gonna use the word "dissociating"...</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:17.006
<i>as if I had separated out from it.</i>

02:20.390 --> 02:21.640
<i>The guilt...</i>

02:23.393 --> 02:24.393
<i>the fear.</i>

02:26.521 --> 02:28.481
<i>It was like I'd hear the click</i>
<i>of the door.</i>

02:29.816 --> 02:31.066
<i>Everything would stop.</i>

02:38.492 --> 02:41.082
<i>I severed a part of me</i>
<i>that stayed in that school.</i>

02:41.453 --> 02:45.043
<i>And I walked out, dusted my feet,</i>
<i>as I was told to do...</i>

02:45.582 --> 02:46.882
<i>and I buried it.</i>

02:48.460 --> 02:54.010
<i>And it didn't come back up...</i>
<i>until 20-some years later.</i>

04:05.162 --> 04:06.202
I did everything right.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.368
This is the October 1st through 7th
of '71.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.418
Okay.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.539
Uh... yes.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.007
[Abbie speaking indistinctly]

04:16.882 --> 04:19.432
[Gemma] <i> I loved my high school years.</i>

04:21.720 --> 04:25.430
<i>I loved my teachers, I loved my friends.</i>

04:26.391 --> 04:31.101
I had no idea that this stuff was going on
in that building.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.733
No idea.

04:35.692 --> 04:41.162
[Abbie] <i> There was no public information</i>
<i>out there until 1994,</i>

04:41.656 --> 04:47.576
<i>when one Keough student came forward</i>
<i>with allegations of sexual abuse</i>

04:47.662 --> 04:51.712
<i>by Father Maskell</i>
<i>and Maskell being involved in the murder.</i>

04:57.589 --> 04:59.129
<i>I have to confess...</i>

05:00.258 --> 05:03.388
<i>I was one of the people who said,</i>
<i>you know:</i>

05:03.470 --> 05:05.510
<i>"I-- I just don't believe all this."</i>

05:07.098 --> 05:08.098
<i>I was there.</i>

05:08.809 --> 05:11.979
I never heard a word, never saw a thing.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.315
<i>We were just oblivious.</i>

05:24.616 --> 05:27.486
<i>There was so much publicity</i>
<i>when she came forward.</i>

05:29.871 --> 05:31.331
[Gemma] <i> There were lots of rumors.</i>

05:33.875 --> 05:36.495
<i>Everybody was wondering who was Jane Doe.</i>

05:41.633 --> 05:43.473
[Greg] I don't know.
They'll take their time.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.352
Can we get a check on the window?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.932
I think I see movement in the window.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.059
Close the mid-door.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.981
[crowd chattering]

05:52.060 --> 05:53.900
-[Greg] Hurry up. Hurry up.
-[woman 1] Hurry up.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.066
-[all] Surprise!
-[Greg] Happy anniversary!

05:59.150 --> 06:00.650
[Greg whoops]

06:00.735 --> 06:02.775
-[woman 2] Where's Michael?
-[man 1] Where's Michael?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.822
-[Greg] Where's the other half?
-Dad's parking the car!

06:05.907 --> 06:07.657
-[Greg] Oh.
-[man 2] What a gentleman.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.912
[Greg] Mom, go back out
and come in with Dad.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.584
Come on!

06:13.665 --> 06:16.035
-Happy anniversary!
-[all] Surprise!

06:16.126 --> 06:17.416
[Greg whoops]

06:17.502 --> 06:19.502
[crowd whooping and clapping]

06:21.923 --> 06:23.383
[Greg laughing]

06:28.305 --> 06:30.095
[woman] Perfect. Okay. Now, sing.

06:30.181 --> 06:34.441
<i>-â™ª Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world â™ª</i>
<i>-â™ª Ooh, baby, baby, it's a bad world â™ª</i>

06:34.519 --> 06:35.769
[Sarah laughs]

06:35.854 --> 06:39.734
[Sarah] <i> In the '90s,</i>
<i>I would say it was pretty idyllic</i>

06:39.816 --> 06:42.646
in the sense that I always knew

06:42.736 --> 06:45.696
that both my parents really loved me
and were really proud of me.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.328
I loved being their kid, you know.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.288
I had everything I needed
and almost everything I wanted.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.043
<i>We were happy.</i>

06:54.414 --> 06:57.834
[Sarah] <i> My dad worked as a carpenter,</i>
<i>as a contractor,</i>

06:58.293 --> 07:02.633
<i>and my mom was a Eucharistic minister,</i>
<i>so, we were really involved in the church.</i>

07:04.633 --> 07:07.143
[Greg] <i> Socially, it was--</i>
<i>It was the center of our life.</i>

07:07.385 --> 07:10.715
<i>It was either going to the school</i>
<i>and doing something with the church.</i>

07:10.805 --> 07:13.635
<i>It was church friends, prayer groups,</i>
<i>and the kids would play.</i>

07:14.684 --> 07:17.604
Our understanding was,
is that the strength came from God

07:17.687 --> 07:20.897
and our relationship with each other
through God and the church.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.363
<i>Um...</i>

07:22.859 --> 07:24.569
<i>You know, that was, uh...</i>

07:24.653 --> 07:25.823
<i>It was just understood.</i>

07:26.988 --> 07:28.868
[upbeat music playing]

07:28.949 --> 07:34.159
[Jean] <i> It was--</i>
<i>These were really very... special days.</i>

07:36.623 --> 07:39.463
<i>We used to laugh</i>
<i>and say we were contemplatives</i>

07:39.542 --> 07:40.922
<i>in an ordinary life.</i>

07:43.254 --> 07:46.634
[Jean] <i> We were walking around</i>
<i>taking care of kids and making ends meet.</i>

07:47.676 --> 07:51.716
<i>But the depth of spiritual growth was...</i>

07:52.430 --> 07:53.810
[band playing ballad]

07:53.890 --> 07:54.810
[Jean] <i> It was a gift.</i>

07:54.891 --> 07:56.891
[crowd chattering]

07:58.645 --> 08:00.305
[man 1 singing indistinctly]

08:00.397 --> 08:02.067
[woman] Aw!

08:02.148 --> 08:03.858
-[woman] That's-- That's it.
-[man 2] Yeah.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.692
[man 3] For the saxophone player.

08:05.777 --> 08:09.107
[Jean] <i>I met Mike</i>
<i>right at the end of my senior year.</i>

08:09.197 --> 08:10.027
[crowd whoops]

08:10.573 --> 08:13.833
[Jean] <i> He was like the lifesaver</i>
<i>that got thrown in for me.</i>

08:17.330 --> 08:19.710
<i>But for the first nine years</i>
<i>of our marriage,</i>

08:19.791 --> 08:21.581
<i>I would always say to him I liked him</i>

08:22.085 --> 08:24.415
<i>and I thought he should go out</i>
<i>and find somebody</i>

08:24.504 --> 08:30.644
<i>who could really appreciate the love</i>
<i>that he was... bestowing on me.</i>

08:31.052 --> 08:33.562
<i>And he said, "It's okay.</i>
<i>I'll-- I'll take what I can get."</i>

08:33.638 --> 08:35.138
[Jean laughs]

08:35.222 --> 08:36.852
[crowd whooping]

08:38.434 --> 08:40.434
[crowd chattering]

08:50.030 --> 08:50.910
[Jean] <i> Now...</i>

08:51.906 --> 08:53.986
<i>this is the beginning of '92.</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:58.462
<i>I was about 38 years old</i>

08:58.538 --> 09:02.418
<i>and just finishing up</i>
<i>a spiritual directing program.</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:10.125
<i>Mike and I were looking</i>
<i>to buy a new house,</i>

09:10.675 --> 09:16.305
and the real estate agent
happened to be a classmate from Keough.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.350
<i>We were in my dining room</i>

09:20.977 --> 09:24.767
<i>and she was asking</i>
<i>about me going to a reunion.</i>

09:26.107 --> 09:27.397
<i>"You would love it. It--</i>

09:27.484 --> 09:30.824
Everybody gets together. We're gonna
do this different thing this time."

09:30.904 --> 09:34.124
And I was like, "No, I don't--
I don't usually go to the reunions."

09:34.199 --> 09:40.159
And I felt like I was dancing to get
as far away from that topic as possible.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.626
And I didn't understand any of that.

09:45.835 --> 09:49.335
I just knew it was uncomfortable,
I knew I didn't like Keough,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.722
I knew I never went
to any of the reunions,

09:51.800 --> 09:53.800
and she made me look at it.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.719
Like, why?

10:00.975 --> 10:05.265
<i>And I go through a couple days</i>
<i>of feeling like something's not right.</i>

10:08.066 --> 10:11.856
<i>Now, remember... I was a prayerful person.</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:18.159
<i>I had-- I have prayer for hour,</i>
<i>hour and a half every day...</i>

10:19.994 --> 10:24.504
and I decided that Lent,
I would do what I did best,

10:24.582 --> 10:26.292
which was take it into prayer...

10:27.252 --> 10:30.212
<i>settle down, and just be still...</i>

10:31.798 --> 10:35.468
<i>and work with it on a prayerful level.</i>

10:39.764 --> 10:43.894
So, I-- I quieted down...

10:45.687 --> 10:48.767
and I let myself just kind of be.

10:51.067 --> 10:54.237
<i>And with that came memories.</i>

10:56.614 --> 10:59.164
<i>It was like throwing up,</i>
<i>that's what I would say.</i>

10:59.242 --> 11:03.542
<i>It was like this feeling of standing</i>
<i>before an abyss,</i>

11:03.621 --> 11:08.171
<i>this black hole,</i>
<i>and throwing up these memories.</i>

11:18.636 --> 11:19.756
<i>And at the end of it...</i>

11:22.181 --> 11:28.191
<i>was a memory</i>
<i>that I had always had a part of it...</i>

11:30.064 --> 11:31.444
<i>but not the whole part.</i>

11:36.613 --> 11:39.953
<i>It was Magnus in this confessional.</i>

11:44.871 --> 11:49.751
<i>He asked me what was my name</i>
<i>and could he look at me.</i>

11:50.376 --> 11:51.586
<i>I always remembered that.</i>

11:51.669 --> 11:53.169
<i>I knew it was always Magnus.</i>

11:54.839 --> 11:56.379
<i>Now what I remembered,</i>

11:57.675 --> 12:00.545
<i>he is now looking at me...</i>

12:00.637 --> 12:04.217
<i>and he's asking me questions</i>
<i>about my uncle.</i>

12:07.602 --> 12:09.442
<i>And as he's asking me...</i>

12:11.147 --> 12:12.227
<i>he's masturbating.</i>

12:16.694 --> 12:18.704
[tinkling]

12:31.167 --> 12:33.087
<i>And I actually felt relief.</i>

12:35.046 --> 12:36.456
<i>"I can deal with this."</i>

12:42.345 --> 12:44.635
<i>I decided that I was going to go over</i>

12:44.722 --> 12:46.852
<i>and find my yearbook</i>
<i>in my mother's attic...</i>

12:48.101 --> 12:50.901
and I'm going to put a face on this.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.653
<i>And then I could put some closure to it.</i>

12:57.110 --> 12:59.360
<i>And so I pulled out the yearbook.</i>

12:59.445 --> 13:03.405
<i>And when I opened it up,</i>
<i>I saw Magnus' face.</i>

13:05.076 --> 13:07.696
<i>And when I saw Maskell's face</i>
<i>next to him...</i>

13:09.038 --> 13:11.328
<i>all I thought was,</i>
<i>"Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh shit."</i>

13:13.334 --> 13:17.424
<i>I wanted it to be the end of everything</i>
<i>that I had to come to terms with.</i>

13:19.882 --> 13:22.052
And instead,
I felt like it was the beginning.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.944
<i>So, in the course of X amount of months</i>

13:35.023 --> 13:36.153
<i>in '92...</i>

13:38.109 --> 13:40.319
<i>I had these memories.</i>

13:42.071 --> 13:44.281
<i>What I was remembering was so horrible.</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:47.485
<i>It was as if a 14-year-old came in</i>
<i>and sat down next to me</i>

13:47.577 --> 13:49.947
<i>and started telling me</i>
<i>what happened to her.</i>

13:51.164 --> 13:53.084
And I was appalled.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.956
I thought for sure I was crazy.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.671
But at the same time,

13:57.336 --> 14:00.506
<i>I was consumed</i>
<i>by what was happening inside of me.</i>

14:01.424 --> 14:03.764
<i>I not only hoped that I was insane,</i>

14:03.843 --> 14:06.973
<i>'cause I would have rather it been that</i>
<i>than this really did happen,</i>

14:07.680 --> 14:11.640
but I was a grown woman
who had a sense of who I was.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.230
And I had my sense
of what was right and wrong,

14:14.312 --> 14:18.982
and I had my sense of why, you know,
you don't let that kind of thing happen.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.148
<i>I had my sense of having children</i>
<i>and I taught them:</i>

14:23.237 --> 14:25.567
<i>"You tell somebody if something happens."</i>

14:29.118 --> 14:33.038
<i>And I, as a grown woman,</i>
<i>was condemning myself</i>

14:33.122 --> 14:35.962
because I'm looking at this girl

14:36.626 --> 14:37.956
and I'm saying the same thing

14:38.044 --> 14:41.424
that I'm sure many of other people
who are hearing this story said.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.466
<i>"Why didn't she tell somebody?"</i>

14:46.636 --> 14:48.636
<i>"How could she let that go on that long?"</i>

14:50.223 --> 14:51.393
<i>"Why didn't--?" You know.</i>

14:52.308 --> 14:53.938
"She must've liked it.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.438
She must have wanted it.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.770
She must have deserved it."

15:09.117 --> 15:13.367
<i>So, at this time I'm still very Catholic,</i>
<i>but I've stopped going to church.</i>

15:15.581 --> 15:18.421
<i>So, I went up to my pastor.</i>

15:19.710 --> 15:21.800
[Sarah] <i> Father Art, he was awesome.</i>

15:21.879 --> 15:24.299
He was really accessible,
and he was young,

15:24.382 --> 15:27.722
<i>and he was, like,</i>
<i>a very down-to-earth priest.</i>

15:29.595 --> 15:30.965
<i>He was just beloved.</i>

15:34.392 --> 15:35.602
[Jean] <i> We were friends.</i>

15:37.270 --> 15:38.150
<i>So...</i>

15:39.230 --> 15:41.690
I wanted, I guess, in my own way,

15:41.774 --> 15:45.534
because I trusted him as a pastor,
as a priest,

15:45.611 --> 15:51.701
as somebody who knew us...
to tell him what I was remembering.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.246
<i>He proceeded through the course</i>
<i>of a couple visits</i>

15:58.332 --> 16:00.882
<i>to tell me that Magnus had died...</i>

16:02.962 --> 16:07.972
<i>but that Father Maskell</i>
<i>was an active pastor</i>

16:08.050 --> 16:09.340
<i>downtown at Holy Cross.</i>

16:21.063 --> 16:24.283
<i>Art said that he wanted me to talk</i>
<i>to Rick Woy,</i>

16:24.358 --> 16:26.858
<i>who represented the archdiocese.</i>

16:28.529 --> 16:34.909
<i>And at that first meeting with him,</i>
<i>Rick Woy held a manila folder.</i>

16:35.870 --> 16:38.370
<i>And it had--</i>
<i>It didn't look like it had anything in it.</i>

16:38.456 --> 16:40.956
Maybe two pieces of paper,
and he said I was the first

16:41.042 --> 16:43.842
to voice a complaint like this
about Joseph Maskell...

16:44.629 --> 16:45.759
but that he believed me.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.335
<i>He was so personable</i>

16:49.425 --> 16:52.925
<i>and told me</i>
<i>that Maskell was very intelligent,</i>

16:53.012 --> 16:55.972
and that if they didn't have everything
in place,

16:56.057 --> 16:58.767
he would slip right through their fingers.

17:07.151 --> 17:11.951
[Abbie] <i> In 1967, Maskell was moved</i>
<i>from St. Clement's to Keough.</i>

17:12.740 --> 17:16.700
<i>He continued at Keough until '75.</i>

17:17.537 --> 17:22.877
<i>We were told that a new principal came in</i>
<i>and began getting complaints from parents.</i>

17:23.667 --> 17:26.838
She was known
as a no-nonsense sort of nun.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.761
<i>She told him that he had 15 minutes</i>
<i>to pack his things and get out.</i>

17:33.636 --> 17:35.096
<i>Maskell was then assigned</i>

17:35.179 --> 17:38.269
<i>to work at the Catholic Archdiocese</i>
<i>Division of Schools.</i>

17:39.267 --> 17:43.267
<i>The church records are a little vague.</i>
<i>We've been calling them the mystery years.</i>

17:43.813 --> 17:45.903
What was he doing from '75 to '80?

17:47.358 --> 17:50.858
In 1980,
he was pulled from his assignment

17:50.945 --> 17:52.735
working with the Division of Schools.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.200
<i>He was sent to a different parish</i>
<i>called Annunciation.</i>

17:58.703 --> 18:02.003
<i>In 1982, two years later,</i>

18:02.081 --> 18:06.171
<i>he was sent to Holy Cross parish</i>
<i>in Baltimore...</i>

18:07.086 --> 18:12.006
<i>and he was there in '92</i>
<i>when Jane Doe came forward.</i>

18:13.217 --> 18:16.887
[Jean] <i> I had a second meeting</i>
<i>with Rick Woy.</i>

18:17.722 --> 18:21.352
<i>At this one,</i>
<i>he had the archdiocesan lawyer with him...</i>

18:22.435 --> 18:26.185
<i>Kathy Hoskins.</i>
<i>She suggested that I get a lawyer</i>

18:26.647 --> 18:32.147
in case Joseph Maskell were to sue me
for the things that I was saying.

18:35.323 --> 18:39.493
<i>So, we found a lawyer, Steve Tully,</i>

18:39.577 --> 18:44.327
<i>and the church was paying his fee,</i>
<i>and so, it was a mutual--</i>

18:44.415 --> 18:46.915
They kept saying we were on the same page,
all doing--

18:47.001 --> 18:49.671
You know, just kind of making sure
everything's in place.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.756
-[girl] Hey, Mom.
-[woman] Hi. Uh...

18:55.843 --> 18:58.853
[girl] Okay, now we're walking
into the kitchen.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.889
Oh, look who it is. Oh, look.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.393
-[man] And we got-- It's very bright.
-[girl] Hi, Aunt Jeanie.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.306
-Hi, how are you?
-[girl] Good. How are you?

19:05.394 --> 19:08.444
-I'm doing okay. Yeah.
-That's very good.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.900
[Jean] <i> When I started to remember...</i>

19:11.942 --> 19:12.822
[girl] Hi.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.704
[Jean] <i> ...no one knows any of this</i>
<i>is going on.</i>

19:15.780 --> 19:17.570
-[man] How are you?
-[girl] Good. How are you?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.157
-[man] Fantastic.
-[girl] That's good."

19:19.241 --> 19:20.201
[woman laughing]

19:20.284 --> 19:22.954
[Jean] <i> There were few people</i>
<i>that I allowed in.</i>

19:25.581 --> 19:26.421
<i>Mike...</i>

19:27.416 --> 19:29.126
I was afraid that he would say--

19:29.210 --> 19:32.510
When he would know these things,
that I was a whore and he would leave.

19:32.588 --> 19:36.178
So, I always protected myself that
that was going to happen on some level.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.682
<i>This is so shameful.</i>

19:42.223 --> 19:44.893
<i>I was disgusted with myself.</i>

19:46.894 --> 19:50.694
<i>And I would say to Mike,</i>
<i>"Mike, you know, you leave."</i>

19:51.691 --> 19:53.651
He's like, "They did these things to you.

19:53.734 --> 19:54.654
You did not do them.

19:54.735 --> 19:58.775
I still consider myself the first person
that was with you."

20:02.284 --> 20:06.044
<i>And whatever we were going to do,</i>
<i>we were doing it together.</i>

20:09.291 --> 20:11.341
<i>So, I had the archdiocese say:</i>

20:11.419 --> 20:14.379
<i>"We would like for you</i>
<i>to make a formal statement,"</i>

20:14.463 --> 20:21.143
and that would help them remove him from--
Father Maskell from his church.

20:29.437 --> 20:33.767
<i>I am, at this point,</i>
<i>only remembering these priests</i>

20:33.858 --> 20:37.988
<i>from around April, I believe, of that--</i>
<i>of that year.</i>

20:38.070 --> 20:39.320
<i>So, here, it's September.</i>

20:41.782 --> 20:44.082
<i>And Father Maskell...</i>

20:45.161 --> 20:46.831
I didn't know who the hell he was.

20:46.912 --> 20:50.422
I didn't-- I don't know him,
and yet I do know him.

20:53.461 --> 20:56.171
<i>So, every time I went to talk to them...</i>

20:57.298 --> 20:59.468
<i>I had to also deal</i>
<i>with the tremendous fear</i>

20:59.550 --> 21:02.220
<i>that Maskell was gonna be in the room.</i>

21:04.638 --> 21:06.768
It was terror.

21:07.433 --> 21:11.773
And when you feel that terror,
you know that it's true.

21:11.896 --> 21:15.356
You know that no matter what is coming up,
no matter what the thoughts,

21:15.441 --> 21:17.531
no matter what the memory,
you know it's true.

21:26.494 --> 21:29.754
So... I'm trying to do the right thing,

21:29.830 --> 21:33.710
and I'm feeling like... I will take this.

21:33.793 --> 21:37.383
I-- You know, I'll take this and I--
And I-- I can give them a statement.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.721
<i>So, it was me and Mike</i>
<i>and we met downtown.</i>

21:44.345 --> 21:48.215
<i>And I took these seven memories with me,</i>

21:48.307 --> 21:51.137
<i>thinking that would be the statement,</i>
<i>that they wanted to know</i>

21:51.227 --> 21:53.057
<i>what kind of stuff went on.</i>

21:54.688 --> 21:57.898
<i>I wouldn't wanna talk about these things</i>
<i>with anyone,</i>

21:57.983 --> 22:02.283
<i>much less with a priest across the table</i>
<i>and a lawyer and another lawyer.</i>

22:02.863 --> 22:03.823
<i>But, um...</i>

22:04.573 --> 22:06.993
So, this is one of the memories
that I read

22:07.076 --> 22:09.196
to the archdiocesan representatives.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.919
"Father Maskell had me come to the office
one day when I had free mods.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.503
<i>I was afraid to go in, but I did.</i>

22:16.585 --> 22:17.835
<i>He looked very angry.</i>

22:17.920 --> 22:20.170
<i>He said,</i>
<i>'So, you're here. I knew you'd come.</i>

22:20.756 --> 22:22.086
<i>All you whores are alike.'</i>

22:23.050 --> 22:26.390
<i>He told me I was a bad person,</i>
<i>and it made him so angry</i>

22:26.470 --> 22:30.980
<i>that there were people like me around</i>
<i>that he had to do his part to stop us.</i>

22:31.976 --> 22:33.056
He pulled his penis out

22:33.143 --> 22:35.813
and said God wanted me
to receive the Holy Spirit

22:35.896 --> 22:37.396
and it was flowing through him.

22:37.481 --> 22:41.111
<i>I wanted to throw up. I wanted to run.</i>
<i>I hated being me.</i>

22:41.193 --> 22:43.283
<i>But I was afraid of saying no.</i>

22:43.821 --> 22:47.581
He said when I was done,
'See? That is why God can't help you.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.948
<i>You really like doing bad things.</i>

22:50.035 --> 22:52.245
<i>I need to do a lot of praying for you.'</i>

22:53.706 --> 22:55.206
<i>He walked me to the door.</i>

22:55.749 --> 22:57.789
He said very soft and slow,

22:58.127 --> 23:00.547
'I know you hated that. I'm glad.'

23:01.255 --> 23:03.585
He gave me his blessing and I left."

23:13.267 --> 23:15.267
[crying]

23:24.987 --> 23:27.357
<i>And they listened to me read these.</i>

23:29.450 --> 23:30.910
And they took their copies.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.922
<i>And he wanted me to point to somebody</i>
<i>in a yearbook.</i>

23:37.708 --> 23:40.088
<i>"We really need someone to corroborate.</i>

23:41.086 --> 23:44.086
<i>You bring us a name of someone else</i>
<i>who had this experience, too,</i>

23:44.173 --> 23:45.473
<i>and we can get him out."</i>

23:49.345 --> 23:50.925
And I said, "I'm living in a hell.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.933
I'm not putting anybody else
through that.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.943
Somebody else wants to come and talk,
they'll come and talk.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.269
I'm not giving you any names
even if I had them."

24:28.967 --> 24:33.757
Maskell was at Holy Cross parish
until 1992.

24:33.847 --> 24:39.307
In October of 1992, after learning
of the allegations from Jane Doe,

24:39.395 --> 24:44.015
<i>the archdioceses told Maskell</i>
<i>that he needed to go to a hospital</i>

24:44.108 --> 24:46.398
<i>named the Institute of Living</i>
<i>in Connecticut.</i>

24:46.985 --> 24:48.395
Institute of Living...

24:48.904 --> 24:51.244
um... clergy...

24:51.990 --> 24:52.990
sexual abuse.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.155
Let's see if we can--

24:54.785 --> 24:58.245
Okay. "'Treating Clergy
Who Sexually Abuse Minors:

24:58.914 --> 25:02.214
A 16-Year Experience
at the Institute of Living,'

25:02.793 --> 25:04.133
<i>by L.M. Lothstein."</i>

25:05.170 --> 25:07.130
[Lothstein] <i> When I was</i>
<i>at the Institute of Living,</i>

25:07.214 --> 25:08.674
<i>I directed the Psychology Department.</i>

25:08.757 --> 25:13.597
They asked me if I would help them
to put together

25:14.138 --> 25:15.808
<i>an in-patient program</i>

25:15.889 --> 25:19.179
<i>for the treatment</i>
<i>of impaired and distressed professionals,</i>

25:19.268 --> 25:21.018
<i>including Catholic priests.</i>

25:22.980 --> 25:24.190
And that's how it started.

25:26.442 --> 25:29.822
<i>Typically,</i>
<i>the archdiocese would send a priest,</i>

25:30.404 --> 25:32.364
<i>and they would say</i>
<i>the person's depressed,</i>

25:32.990 --> 25:36.160
<i>the person is having difficulty</i>
<i>in their relationships</i>

25:36.243 --> 25:39.083
with others in the church,
the person was having authority problems.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.923
<i>And at one point,</i>

25:43.000 --> 25:45.170
<i>the guy sitting in front of me,</i>
<i>a priest...</i>

25:46.587 --> 25:49.877
<i>I said, "Well, I understand you're here</i>
<i>for depression.</i>

25:50.424 --> 25:51.264
<i>What's going on?"</i>

25:53.719 --> 25:57.179
And he said, "I'm not here for depression.
I had sex with a 14-year-old.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.644
And I told it to the bishop,
and he sent me here."

26:01.935 --> 26:02.765
[gasps]

26:04.646 --> 26:08.066
<i>He said-- He says, "The bishop was afraid</i>
<i>I was gonna be arrested,</i>

26:08.150 --> 26:10.530
<i>and he didn't want news to come out,</i>
<i>so, he sent me here."</i>

26:13.822 --> 26:15.282
<i>I called the bishop and I said:</i>

26:15.365 --> 26:18.195
<i>"I just can't understand</i>
<i>why you would do something like that.</i>

26:19.369 --> 26:22.999
We're not here to protect the diocese
from the embarrassment of his arrest."

26:25.876 --> 26:28.706
<i>This is what happened</i>
<i>over and over and over again.</i>

26:29.755 --> 26:32.755
<i>By about '94, '95,</i>
<i>we confronted this issue.</i>

26:34.384 --> 26:37.184
<i>We basically said,</i>
<i>"We're not gonna accept any more patients</i>

26:37.721 --> 26:40.391
<i>from the Catholic Church</i>
<i>unless you send us the whole file...</i>

26:41.099 --> 26:43.019
<i>and every file you have on the patient...</i>

26:43.811 --> 26:46.271
<i>and tell us the real reason</i>
<i>for why they're coming."</i>

26:49.942 --> 26:52.072
We never got a single referral again.

26:54.988 --> 26:58.578
[Abbie] <i> If the archdiocese had</i>
<i>all these complaints about his behavior,</i>

26:58.659 --> 27:02.329
<i>ethically,</i>
<i>they should have sent Maskell's history</i>

27:02.412 --> 27:04.712
<i>of these known abuse episodes with him.</i>

27:06.333 --> 27:07.673
<i>And we just don't know.</i>

27:09.253 --> 27:12.383
<i>You have to wonder what's going on.</i>

27:13.757 --> 27:15.047
[sighs]

27:23.183 --> 27:28.363
[Jean] <i> And so, in the course of the next,</i>
<i>I don't know, month and a half or so...</i>

27:31.233 --> 27:32.483
<i>I've now remembered...</i>

27:34.570 --> 27:38.910
<i>not just the abuse</i>
<i>that these two priests had done...</i>

27:41.451 --> 27:44.661
<i>but also there's other adults,</i>
<i>like the police...</i>

27:46.248 --> 27:51.338
<i>and this Brother Bob...</i>
<i>who had also been abusing me.</i>

27:55.424 --> 28:00.354
<i>I could go into my quiet</i>
<i>and the memory would flow.</i>

28:01.889 --> 28:08.149
<i>I couldn't have anyone with me,</i>
<i>because it was a very vulnerable feeling.</i>

28:09.229 --> 28:12.359
<i>I never remembered things</i>
<i>when I was with therapists.</i>

28:13.942 --> 28:17.952
<i>And I was very aware</i>
<i>that I did not want to contaminate</i>

28:18.405 --> 28:19.445
<i>what was coming up.</i>

28:22.951 --> 28:26.371
<i>This is now December 1992.</i>

28:28.624 --> 28:29.794
<i>Any interaction I had</i>

28:29.875 --> 28:33.085
<i>with the representatives</i>
<i>of the archdiocese,</i>

28:33.629 --> 28:37.929
<i>I was being told that... first time</i>
<i>that they had complained about this</i>

28:38.008 --> 28:42.138
<i>and if I could get a corroborating witness</i>
<i>to what I was saying,</i>

28:42.221 --> 28:44.471
<i>they could do something more definite</i>
<i>with him.</i>

28:47.726 --> 28:48.846
It was all back on me.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.071
<i>I was trying still to be</i>
<i>the good little girl</i>

28:55.150 --> 28:56.610
<i>and give them what they wanted.</i>

28:57.277 --> 29:00.447
<i>So, I'm feeling really,</i>
<i>like, I'm gonna give them what I--</i>

29:00.530 --> 29:01.700
<i>What I'm remembering.</i>

29:04.868 --> 29:07.368
<i>December the 9th, 1992...</i>

29:07.955 --> 29:13.915
<i>we had a meeting where I brought names</i>
<i>of other abusers at Keough.</i>

29:16.588 --> 29:18.508
<i>They were very upset with that.</i>

29:18.590 --> 29:20.010
<i>They were very upset with that.</i>

29:21.134 --> 29:24.434
See, they want a name of a girl
who they can go up to and say:

29:24.513 --> 29:25.893
"Did this ever happen to you?"

29:26.390 --> 29:28.560
But I'd give them names of adults
and they say:

29:28.642 --> 29:30.142
"We can't go up to someone and say:

29:30.227 --> 29:32.687
'Well, someone's, you know,
saying that you abused them.'"

29:34.523 --> 29:38.613
<i>Next day we called my lawyer,</i>
<i>Steve Tully's office.</i>

29:38.694 --> 29:42.614
He was, "What do you think you did?
What were you doing the other day?

29:43.365 --> 29:46.575
<i>It was a waste of two hours.</i>
<i>They can't do anything with those names."</i>

29:48.412 --> 29:50.832
<i>Mike... he was infuriated.</i>

29:52.207 --> 29:53.707
<i>He called Steve Tully...</i>

29:53.792 --> 29:54.792
<i>and fired him.</i>

29:55.460 --> 29:57.460
<i>Said,</i>
<i>"We don't need your services anymore."</i>

30:06.555 --> 30:10.425
<i>That night, I called Rick Woy,</i>

30:11.310 --> 30:15.310
<i>and I told him</i>
<i>that Mike had fired Steve Tully...</i>

30:16.481 --> 30:20.611
and that I wondered
if he would meet with me in the sacristy

30:20.694 --> 30:22.074
and we could pray,

30:22.154 --> 30:25.874
because I always found that
I got insight and direction with prayer,

30:26.450 --> 30:29.830
and that maybe we'd be able to figure out
what to do with this.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.959
<i>Rick Woy said to me</i>
<i>he didn't think it was a good idea</i>

30:34.041 --> 30:36.791
and that he suggests I get a lawyer.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.960
And that was devastating.

30:44.426 --> 30:48.716
<i>He now has taken any hope...</i>

30:50.474 --> 30:54.564
that this was still something
that we were on the same page

30:54.644 --> 30:55.564
working together.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.775
<i>So, Mike and I decided to hire</i>
<i>the team of...</i>

31:04.488 --> 31:08.778
<i>Phil Dantes, Jim Maggio</i>
<i>and Beverly Wallace.</i>

31:10.535 --> 31:13.155
[Beverly] <i> I grew up in a very small town</i>
<i>in Kentucky.</i>

31:13.246 --> 31:15.076
And when I was little,

31:15.165 --> 31:18.665
my two best friends came home
and said, "Sister Mary... Whatever.

31:18.752 --> 31:22.802
...says we can't play with you anymore.
You're a heathen. You're not Catholic."

31:22.881 --> 31:24.471
I didn't know what heathen meant.

31:25.634 --> 31:29.554
<i>So, to me,</i>
<i>my view of the Catholic church was just--</i>

31:30.180 --> 31:32.220
They're another church, and...

31:32.849 --> 31:38.189
I didn't see the archdiocese
as this, you know, monumental institution.

31:39.856 --> 31:43.106
<i>Jean, I think, came from a sincere desire</i>

31:43.193 --> 31:45.613
<i>to make them aware of what was going on</i>

31:45.695 --> 31:48.905
and to ensure that this didn't happen
to anybody else.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.451
<i>She was in the process</i>
<i>of recovering memories,</i>

31:53.537 --> 31:57.537
<i>and some days she was able to sit down</i>
<i>and talk and plan,</i>

31:57.624 --> 32:01.094
<i>and some days she just said,</i>
<i>"I-- It's not a good day."</i>

32:02.504 --> 32:05.174
<i>But she was trying to put in place</i>
<i>in her life</i>

32:05.257 --> 32:08.637
<i>the things that she needed</i>
<i>to get her through this rough time...</i>

32:08.718 --> 32:11.758
<i>The therapists,</i>
<i>Mike, her husband, her children.</i>

32:11.888 --> 32:14.468
<i>...to support her</i>
<i>to the extent she needed it.</i>

32:21.148 --> 32:24.398
[Jean] <i> So, then we move into, then,</i>
<i>early 1993.</i>

32:26.361 --> 32:27.531
<i>"Dear Jean:</i>

32:28.238 --> 32:32.078
<i>We need to emphasize again the importance</i>
<i>of corroborating testimony</i>

32:32.159 --> 32:34.869
<i>regarding inappropriate sexual activity.</i>

32:34.953 --> 32:37.873
We understand your reservations
about doing this,

32:37.956 --> 32:40.576
but you also understand
that our hands are tied

32:40.667 --> 32:44.047
in dealing with the priest
unless we have corroboration.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.262
Rick Woy."

32:52.637 --> 32:54.097
<i>And I feel really pressured now</i>

32:54.181 --> 32:56.771
<i>because they're saying</i>
<i>this priest is gonna be back out.</i>

32:59.102 --> 33:03.362
<i>So, I had asked a friend of mine</i>
<i>who had gone to school with me, Maria,</i>

33:03.440 --> 33:04.980
<i>if she would meet with me.</i>

33:07.152 --> 33:09.032
<i>So, we met. She brought a yearbook.</i>

33:11.239 --> 33:12.619
<i>I told her what was happening.</i>

33:14.618 --> 33:16.238
<i>She opened up the yearbook...</i>

33:18.830 --> 33:20.620
and she pointed to...

33:23.919 --> 33:25.169
<i>a picture of Cathy.</i>

33:27.297 --> 33:30.717
<i>"You remember when she, you know,</i>
<i>went missing and she ended up dead."</i>

33:32.385 --> 33:35.385
And the whole time I'm--
Like, I'm just in a fog. I go into a fog,

33:35.472 --> 33:37.642
a spacey place, and it's like "Ahh,"
you know.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.895
<i>And I'm driving home...</i>

33:43.355 --> 33:44.975
<i>and I start to have this feeling...</i>

33:46.399 --> 33:47.729
like I really loved her.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.105
And I'm like, something--

33:50.654 --> 33:51.494
<i>I could feel it.</i>

34:05.710 --> 34:08.710
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>we were having a family meeting.</i>

34:09.297 --> 34:14.427
<i>Everyone was gathering to talk</i>
<i>about how my uncle's abuse impacted</i>

34:14.511 --> 34:15.551
<i>on the whole family.</i>

34:20.100 --> 34:21.480
[Don] <i> We were called to a meeting.</i>

34:22.768 --> 34:26.188
And I was completely oblivious
as to what was going on.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.902
I guess all I remember was going in,
you know...

34:29.650 --> 34:32.321
thinking more I was going
to show support

34:32.404 --> 34:36.784
<i>and we were going to give Jeanie</i>
<i>a chance to tell what happened.</i>

34:37.576 --> 34:39.116
We'd go over and spend a weekend

34:39.202 --> 34:41.292
with my aunt and uncle.

34:41.913 --> 34:46.132
As it turned out,
at some points during our visits,

34:46.585 --> 34:48.295
<i>my uncle would take Jean somewhere...</i>

34:49.254 --> 34:50.094
and abuse her.

34:50.964 --> 34:54.054
She had not really been talking very much
with everybody about Maskell.

34:54.134 --> 34:55.804
-We weren't really tuned in.
-About Keough.

34:55.885 --> 34:59.175
You know, we had heard--
We had heard that there were memories

34:59.264 --> 35:00.104
about Uncle Tom.

35:00.181 --> 35:01.811
-[Ed] That's what the meeting was for.
-Right.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.941
We did not talk like that in my family.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.727
Uh, sex was, uh...

35:07.772 --> 35:09.362
I wouldn't say taboo...

35:10.400 --> 35:14.400
but the level of conversation we had
took a completely different twist

35:14.487 --> 35:15.567
during that meeting.

35:22.203 --> 35:25.333
I could feel it. I'm just kind of--
As I go through the evening,

35:25.415 --> 35:27.375
something was coming.
Something was coming.

35:29.002 --> 35:32.342
<i>The whole time, it's like, "Push it down,</i>
<i>push it down, push it down, push it down.</i>

35:33.965 --> 35:36.925
<i>I loved her and I killed her.</i>

35:39.471 --> 35:43.681
<i>I loved her and I killed her.</i>
<i>I killed her. I killed her."</i>

35:46.519 --> 35:48.269
[Ed] <i> She had to leave the meeting.</i>

35:49.147 --> 35:50.817
And then I could hear her out there.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.857
[Jean] <i> My sister was like, "What's wrong?"</i>
<i>And I said:</i>

35:59.407 --> 36:02.577
<i>"I killed-- I killed Cathy Cesnik."</i>

36:09.209 --> 36:12.499
<i>So, now my family knows that I've</i>
<i>been doing this archdiocesan thing</i>

36:12.587 --> 36:13.547
<i>for six months,</i>

36:14.172 --> 36:16.472
<i>and that I remember these priests.</i>

36:16.549 --> 36:19.219
And so we go back
into the room and she says:

36:19.302 --> 36:22.392
"Okay, the direction of this meeting
is gonna change.

36:22.972 --> 36:25.812
I want you to know
what's been going on with Jeanie.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.601
<i>She's been going to these meetings.</i>
<i>She's been remembering these priests.</i>

36:30.689 --> 36:31.729
<i>And, um...</i>

36:32.816 --> 36:37.696
<i>And now she's remembering</i>
<i>something to do with Sister Cathy Cesnik."</i>

36:39.072 --> 36:42.582
And with that, I fall into my brother Ed.

36:42.659 --> 36:45.369
I didn't know what she was talking about.
"I killed her."

36:45.453 --> 36:47.833
In all honesty, there was just a second
I thought:

36:48.540 --> 36:50.130
"You could not kill somebody."

36:50.208 --> 36:52.668
But the fact that she was saying,
"I killed her--"

36:53.211 --> 36:55.631
You're told something
that is just so hard to fathom.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.419
But nevertheless...

36:57.507 --> 36:59.587
I mean, it was-- I believed her.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.546
That was a three-tier meeting to me.

37:01.636 --> 37:06.386
First the initial shock,
then you had this... sex stuff

37:06.474 --> 37:08.234
that, again, we never discussed,

37:08.309 --> 37:09.889
and then you bring murder into it.

37:09.978 --> 37:13.568
And it's like,
"Well... Well, what do you mean, murder?"

37:21.990 --> 37:24.660
You and I were, like--
We became the detectives.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.543
-We were going through--
-Yeah, in fact--

37:26.619 --> 37:29.579
We were going through microfilm,
going back through all the papers

37:29.664 --> 37:30.964
<i>to figure out what happened.</i>

37:38.798 --> 37:41.378
<i>As you looked more and more</i>
<i>in the newspapers,</i>

37:41.468 --> 37:44.048
<i>then sort of linked up</i>
<i>what she was saying</i>

37:44.137 --> 37:46.767
<i>with what we were reading</i>
<i>in the newspaper...</i>

37:48.558 --> 37:51.138
<i>We thought,</i>
<i>"Well, this makes a lot of sense."</i>

37:52.353 --> 37:55.273
[Mike] <i> Here it is, a scandal</i>
<i>that was going on over at Keough,</i>

37:55.356 --> 37:58.436
<i>so, Jean confided in this Sister</i>
<i>and then the Sister ends up dead.</i>

37:59.778 --> 38:02.108
And I believed Jeanie.
So I was, like, raring to go.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.947
Let's-- Let's get going.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.522
[Jean] <i> And we all have a dark and light.</i>

38:31.768 --> 38:33.808
<i>We all have this shadow.</i>

38:37.357 --> 38:40.107
<i>The part that comes</i>
<i>into the confessional and says:</i>

38:40.193 --> 38:42.783
<i>"My God,</i>
<i>I just can't believe I did this thing.</i>

38:42.862 --> 38:47.202
<i>And please, please, tell me what to do</i>
<i>so I don't have to have it eat me up."</i>

38:50.370 --> 38:51.750
<i>Maskell was...</i>

38:52.497 --> 38:53.787
<i>He was feeding that.</i>

38:56.167 --> 38:59.547
And beating away that part of me
that went in

38:59.629 --> 39:02.589
knowing I could be forgiven
because I was really a good person.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.434
<i>In my remembering--</i>

39:12.517 --> 39:15.347
<i>This is a very difficult thing</i>
<i>to come to terms with.</i>

39:18.356 --> 39:21.816
<i>You start to feel as if</i>
<i>you're ripping masks off your face...</i>

39:22.819 --> 39:24.989
<i>and looking in a mirror</i>
<i>as you're doing it,</i>

39:25.530 --> 39:26.950
<i>and it's very painful.</i>

39:27.282 --> 39:29.032
<i>Because you're not sure anymore.</i>

39:30.118 --> 39:31.328
<i>Who are you?</i>

39:35.790 --> 39:38.330
[Sarah] <i> It was pretty all-consuming</i>
<i>in our house.</i>

39:39.836 --> 39:42.296
<i>Our life was like these two lives.</i>

39:43.840 --> 39:48.260
Like, there was the outer
"everything's fine" life,

39:48.344 --> 39:51.184
and there was, like, there's a--

39:51.264 --> 39:54.484
<i>There's a bomb going off</i>
<i>inside of my house</i>

39:54.976 --> 39:57.556
and everybody's just trying to survive it.

39:59.147 --> 40:02.647
[Greg] <i> There's times where we'd come home</i>
<i>and my dad would be running cover.</i>

40:03.484 --> 40:05.654
<i>He'd be like,</i>
<i>"We need to give your mom space."</i>

40:06.279 --> 40:07.159
<i>That was different.</i>

40:08.323 --> 40:11.163
The best way to look at it
is she probably felt she didn't have--

40:11.534 --> 40:12.914
She was raw, you know.

40:13.995 --> 40:17.665
<i>And-- And even us coming in and wanting</i>
<i>to spend time with her was just painful.</i>

40:20.084 --> 40:24.424
[Jean] <i> So, finally,</i>
<i>I invite my sister Cass over</i>

40:24.505 --> 40:26.875
<i>and Mike to sit with me.</i>

40:28.968 --> 40:31.548
Because it's like I need to remember
what I did to her.

40:32.931 --> 40:36.351
<i>So, we sat,</i>
<i>and I allowed myself to get quiet</i>

40:36.434 --> 40:41.274
<i>with the part of me that was remembering</i>
<i>that I killed Cathy Cesnik.</i>

40:48.154 --> 40:49.574
<i>Being taken to her body.</i>

40:57.789 --> 41:00.579
<i>Wiping at her face with all the maggots.</i>

41:11.594 --> 41:13.014
<i>And Maskell saying:</i>

41:13.096 --> 41:16.056
<i>"You see what happens</i>
<i>when you say bad things about people?"</i>

41:19.644 --> 41:20.774
<i>When it was done...</i>

41:21.813 --> 41:25.153
Cassie said,
"So, you were trying to help her,

41:25.233 --> 41:26.233
not hurt her."

41:27.568 --> 41:31.738
It was another beating down
of anything in me

41:31.823 --> 41:33.743
'cause I felt it was my fault.

41:34.450 --> 41:38.500
<i>I had... acknowledged to Cathy</i>
<i>that there was something going on</i>

41:38.579 --> 41:39.579
<i>that was upsetting me.</i>

41:39.706 --> 41:41.286
<i>She said she would take care of it,</i>

41:41.374 --> 41:44.384
<i>and she's lying on the ground</i>
<i>and she's dead.</i>

41:54.554 --> 41:56.394
<i>After I remembered her death...</i>

41:58.057 --> 42:00.177
<i>I went and had a meeting</i>
<i>with the police</i>

42:00.810 --> 42:05.270
<i>to discuss what I remembered and</i>
<i>what details I could give them about it.</i>

42:07.442 --> 42:10.402
<i>I told them about the maggots in her face.</i>

42:11.529 --> 42:12.989
They were, like, "Yeah, right,"

42:13.072 --> 42:16.412
because the time of year,
there would not have been any maggots.

42:17.410 --> 42:20.200
<i>And I didn't feel they believed me then,</i>

42:20.705 --> 42:24.955
and I doubt that there are people
who will believe... now.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.095
[Bob] Okay.

42:38.014 --> 42:38.854
[grunts]

42:39.724 --> 42:40.564
This one...

42:43.144 --> 42:45.774
is a sword
that would've been carried by...

42:46.314 --> 42:50.494
a supporter of Bonnie Prince Charlie
in the Jacobite Rebellion.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.697
On one side, it's marked 1712.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.448
"Right and prosperity to Scotland."

42:56.991 --> 43:00.831
That would've been prior
to the 1745 rebellion.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.582
So, this sword's been around.

43:03.206 --> 43:04.706
I'd love to know who carried it.

43:06.918 --> 43:11.208
I knew nothing about this case until 1993.

43:13.466 --> 43:14.426
[sighs]

43:14.509 --> 43:15.429
I wonder what...

43:16.469 --> 43:20.099
"With new lead,
police reopen old murder case."

43:20.807 --> 43:21.637
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:22.183 --> 43:24.313
<i>This was our first story on this case.</i>

43:26.521 --> 43:29.821
<i>"Police revived the investigation</i>
<i>this spring</i>

43:29.899 --> 43:33.529
after a former student
at Archbishop Keough High School

43:33.611 --> 43:36.071
approached them with a startling story."

43:38.741 --> 43:42.251
<i>This was the woman</i>
<i>later known as Jane Doe.</i>

43:42.662 --> 43:47.672
And she was the first to bring to light
the possibility or the possible connection

43:47.750 --> 43:51.500
of Father Joseph Maskell
to the death of Sister Catherine Cesnik.

43:53.131 --> 43:56.471
<i>It was a very nebulous story...</i>

43:57.885 --> 44:00.805
<i>because we didn't get a lot</i>
<i>of cooperation.</i>

44:01.597 --> 44:03.517
The police were not pleased.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.265
You know, it forced them into a...

44:06.352 --> 44:10.482
a very extensive investigation
of a case that...

44:11.315 --> 44:14.065
<i>was then already over 20 years old.</i>

44:15.278 --> 44:18.778
The archdiocese was not at all helpful.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.199
<i>They stonewalled us at every turn.</i>

44:26.038 --> 44:30.418
<i>And so, that story occupied us</i>
<i>the next year and a half,</i>

44:30.501 --> 44:32.171
<i>almost exclusively.</i>

44:36.549 --> 44:38.549
[bell tolling]

44:43.598 --> 44:45.388
[Abbie] <i> Father Maskell...</i>

44:45.474 --> 44:48.904
<i>he was at the Institute of Living</i>
<i>in Connecticut, where they--</i>

44:48.978 --> 44:51.058
He was evaluated for about six months.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.935
<i>Around April of '93,</i>

44:55.026 --> 44:59.526
<i>he came back with this sort of clear bill</i>
<i>from them, if you will,</i>

45:00.114 --> 45:02.074
<i>and they assigned him to St. Augustine's.</i>

45:03.743 --> 45:08.413
[Bob] <i> Oh, we interviewed Father Maskell</i>
<i>down at St. Augustine Church in Elkridge.</i>

45:11.626 --> 45:15.046
He was wearing a green...

45:16.505 --> 45:19.125
wool golf cardigan.

45:19.675 --> 45:23.715
And of course, he was very urbane,
very charming...

45:25.139 --> 45:26.389
and denied everything.

45:28.726 --> 45:31.846
<i>You know, he said</i>
<i>this was hysterical nonsense.</i>

45:34.231 --> 45:35.981
[Beverly] <i> When they put him back</i>
<i>in a church,</i>

45:36.525 --> 45:41.195
I think it sent a pretty clear message
that they didn't see him as a threat,

45:41.280 --> 45:47.450
which... certainly was 180 degrees
from the way Jean saw him.

45:49.872 --> 45:52.172
I have, at this point...

45:53.876 --> 45:57.506
said a lot of things about this man,
Joseph Maskell.

46:00.091 --> 46:03.971
<i>I have said that I remembered him</i>
<i>taking me to a dead body.</i>

46:06.013 --> 46:08.143
<i>And now he's out in the public</i>
<i>walking around.</i>

46:11.102 --> 46:12.812
<i>I was terrified for my family.</i>

46:13.813 --> 46:16.653
<i>It felt like someone was gonna come</i>
<i>in my back window.</i>

46:19.568 --> 46:23.818
[Beverly] <i> The archdiocese position</i>
<i>was that there was no corroboration.</i>

46:24.490 --> 46:26.330
<i>They did essentially nothing.</i>

46:27.493 --> 46:30.203
But she had such a great support network.

46:30.329 --> 46:34.829
I mean, her big Catholic family
all came behind her.

46:36.085 --> 46:39.705
<i>And we started investigating</i>

46:39.797 --> 46:42.547
<i>and trying to find</i>
<i>if there were any other victims.</i>

46:44.051 --> 46:48.011
[Val] <i> We were talking about how</i>
<i>to get names of the alumni.</i>

46:48.514 --> 46:50.564
And since I had gone to Seton...

46:51.392 --> 46:53.602
and Seton and Keough had merged,

46:53.686 --> 46:56.606
<i>I went with Ed to the school.</i>

46:56.689 --> 46:59.109
So, we went over one day--
You'll-- You'll love this.

46:59.191 --> 47:00.941
We went to the door. Ding-dong.

47:02.486 --> 47:04.696
<i>Some nun answers the door in the convent.</i>

47:05.448 --> 47:08.828
<i>So, my wife, she says,</i>
<i>"Well, I'm an alumni of Seton,</i>

47:08.993 --> 47:12.123
<i>and I wanna be able</i>
<i>to contact a lot of people</i>

47:12.621 --> 47:14.871
so we can get together
and, like, have a reunion.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.997
And I wondered if you had
any kind of a book

47:17.084 --> 47:19.384
which would have everyone's name
and address."

47:19.462 --> 47:21.882
And she says,
"Oh, yes, but it'll cost you ten bucks."

47:21.964 --> 47:23.554
"That's okay. We'll pay ten bucks."

47:23.632 --> 47:27.802
[chuckling] So, we gave them $10
and they gave us the entire alumni.

47:27.887 --> 47:30.717
And it became a family project for us
because we took--

47:30.806 --> 47:32.636
We made up a little postcard.

47:33.309 --> 47:36.899
[Ed] <i> If you were alumni from the years</i>
<i>of such and such to such and such,</i>

47:37.521 --> 47:41.781
<i>and if you had any experiences</i>
<i>which you considered to be inappropriate,</i>

47:41.859 --> 47:43.319
<i>call her lawyer.</i>

47:43.402 --> 47:46.662
And it was ever-- Just about every sibling
was in my dining room.

47:47.198 --> 47:49.448
<i>And we sat around there</i>
<i>and we just handwrote out</i>

47:49.533 --> 47:50.663
<i>names and addresses,</i>

47:51.494 --> 47:53.294
<i>threw stamps on it, just threw it out.</i>

47:53.370 --> 47:54.910
-[Mike] Probably we sent--
-[Ed] Yeah.

47:54.997 --> 47:56.287
-A thousand of them?
-We went--

47:56.373 --> 47:58.423
All the little--
All my kids prayed over them

47:58.501 --> 48:00.961
before we took them to the post office
and all. We were on it.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.813
[Jean] <i> And so, we waited...</i>

48:12.807 --> 48:14.677
<i>to see what the responses would be.</i>

48:24.026 --> 48:26.646
All right. I'll make the dough
and you make the lemon--

48:26.737 --> 48:28.237
[woman] All right. Did you wash these?

48:28.322 --> 48:30.072
-[Teresa] I scrubbed them really well.
-Okay.

48:30.157 --> 48:31.157
[Teresa] And dried them.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.294
[Teresa hums]

48:34.453 --> 48:37.873
[Teresa] <i> I like to bake,</i>
<i>like, probably three times a week,</i>

48:37.957 --> 48:40.957
<i>and I just find that it calms me down.</i>

48:41.043 --> 48:43.173
[woman] She was making a pie a day
for a while.

48:43.671 --> 48:44.671
[chuckles]

48:46.132 --> 48:48.262
It's cheaper than a shrink, right?

48:51.554 --> 48:56.734
<i>In 1993,</i>
<i>I got an anonymous letter in the mail.</i>

48:58.227 --> 49:02.857
<i>"Do you know of any sexual abuse</i>
<i>that happened at Keough?"</i>

49:04.108 --> 49:05.478
<i>When I read that letter,</i>

49:06.026 --> 49:08.646
I just got so excited.

49:08.737 --> 49:13.197
I-- I ran around the yard and,
and... I was so happy.

49:14.243 --> 49:16.793
<i>I called the number</i>
<i>on the anonymous letter</i>

49:16.871 --> 49:17.751
<i>from a phone booth</i>

49:18.289 --> 49:20.539
<i>because I was afraid</i>
<i>to call from my house.</i>

49:21.167 --> 49:23.627
Teresa called with an edge, you know.

49:23.711 --> 49:27.261
Like, "Why do you wanna talk to me
and who the hell are you?

49:27.339 --> 49:28.969
And why should I talk to you?"

49:29.049 --> 49:34.049
"I don't know who you are,
but I sure know a lot about Keough.

49:34.638 --> 49:38.058
And would you tell me
who you're looking at?"

49:38.142 --> 49:41.562
And I said, "Well, why don't you tell me
who you think I'm talking about?"

49:41.687 --> 49:43.227
And she named Maskell.

49:43.314 --> 49:46.864
I said, "I can tell you stuff
you won't believe that that man did."

49:48.861 --> 49:52.111
<i>When I went to high school,</i>
<i>I was a straight-A student.</i>

49:53.449 --> 49:56.539
<i>I always thought I wanted to be a doctor</i>
<i>or a lawyer.</i>

49:57.578 --> 49:59.708
I was a nerd in the ninth grade.

50:02.208 --> 50:04.538
<i>But the latter part of tenth grade,</i>

50:05.085 --> 50:08.255
I would go to coffeehouses at Gibbons.

50:09.215 --> 50:11.675
<i>Cardinal Gibbons</i>
<i>was a Catholic all-boys school</i>

50:11.759 --> 50:15.889
<i>right next to Keough,</i>
<i>and we would go there and listen to music.</i>

50:17.139 --> 50:19.639
I was, like, trying to be a hippie,

50:19.725 --> 50:23.305
and I didn't wanna be
with the nerds anymore, so... [chuckles]

50:24.897 --> 50:26.897
[choir vocalizing]

50:36.992 --> 50:40.002
One day,
my mom had gone through my purse

50:40.079 --> 50:42.789
and she found some paraphernalia.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.713
A pot pipe.

50:45.668 --> 50:47.838
<i>My parents, they were hysterical.</i>

50:47.920 --> 50:49.380
<i>They could not be consoled.</i>

50:50.256 --> 50:54.336
So, I went to Father Maskell's office

50:54.426 --> 50:58.176
<i>the morning after my parents</i>
<i>had found that in my purse.</i>

51:00.266 --> 51:03.686
<i>I thought that the priest could help me,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

51:06.855 --> 51:09.815
<i>I said,</i>
<i>"My parents are really, really upset.</i>

51:10.442 --> 51:12.952
<i>Could you please talk to them</i>

51:13.028 --> 51:15.948
<i>and tell them that I'm not going off</i>
<i>the deep end</i>

51:16.031 --> 51:18.531
<i>and that everything will be fine?"</i>

51:19.785 --> 51:20.945
<i>I was crying.</i>

51:21.537 --> 51:24.667
<i>And he got up from his chair</i>
<i>behind his desk.</i>

51:25.165 --> 51:28.535
He said, "I'm not supposed to do this.

51:28.627 --> 51:32.757
I'm not supposed to touch... the students,

51:32.840 --> 51:35.510
but sometimes this is necessary."

51:37.428 --> 51:41.178
And things just got bad to worse
after that with Father Maskell.

51:48.856 --> 51:51.226
<i>I was a very happy kid.</i>

51:51.317 --> 51:54.607
<i>I had a lot,</i>
<i>everything I ever needed with my parents.</i>

51:56.905 --> 51:59.985
<i>But this was the dark side of the world.</i>

52:01.618 --> 52:06.328
<i>Like, a realization</i>
<i>that the world I lived in was not real.</i>

52:09.418 --> 52:11.128
<i>He talked to my parents.</i>

52:11.712 --> 52:14.212
I mean, he smooth-talked them really well.

52:15.132 --> 52:18.342
<i>My father</i>
<i>was a very, very strict Catholic.</i>

52:20.471 --> 52:24.771
He completely was convinced
that Father Maskell was saving me.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.030
Maskell called my father

52:35.110 --> 52:38.660
and told him
that I'd have to see a gynecologist

52:38.739 --> 52:41.829
and that he knew Dr. Christian Richter.

52:49.625 --> 52:52.495
<i>Dr. Richter prescribed douches...</i>

52:53.587 --> 52:54.707
<i>three times a week.</i>

52:55.089 --> 52:58.469
<i>And I nev--</i>
<i>I didn't even know what a douche was.</i>

52:59.510 --> 53:03.470
Maskell said that, "That's okay.
You can do that in my office.

53:03.555 --> 53:04.385
I'll help you."

53:05.265 --> 53:09.645
<i>He'd set up the douche bag</i>
<i>and everything and administer it to me.</i>

53:16.944 --> 53:21.874
Another time,
Maskell told my father and mother

53:21.949 --> 53:23.989
that he thought I was schizophrenic...

53:24.535 --> 53:26.695
<i>and he sent me to a doctor.</i>

53:27.788 --> 53:33.168
<i>He prescribed Thorazine,</i>
<i>which is a very strong, strong drug</i>

53:33.252 --> 53:35.962
<i>used on schizophrenics.</i>

53:38.799 --> 53:43.849
<i>"This is going to help you</i>
<i>release the devils from your brain."</i>

53:50.769 --> 53:53.269
<i>Father Maskell was a police chaplain.</i>

53:53.355 --> 53:58.895
<i>And there was one occasion in 1970,</i>
<i>on Halloween night...</i>

54:00.279 --> 54:02.909
<i>my girlfriend was spending the night.</i>

54:04.032 --> 54:06.242
[phone ringing]

54:06.326 --> 54:09.156
[Teresa] <i>Maskell had called my parents</i>

54:09.246 --> 54:12.826
and told them that he was gonna
take the girls out for a Halloween...

54:12.916 --> 54:14.916
um, police run.

54:19.298 --> 54:24.638
<i>We rode down some wooded area,</i>
<i>like a lover's lane kind of place.</i>

54:28.640 --> 54:33.230
<i>And there were some young people</i>
<i>with the police shining flashlights,</i>

54:33.312 --> 54:35.362
<i>making them break it up.</i>

54:35.439 --> 54:37.109
<i>And as they went on their way...</i>

54:42.488 --> 54:48.238
<i>Maskell told my friend...</i>
<i>to get out of his car.</i>

54:53.290 --> 54:58.380
<i>And Maskell stood outside of his car</i>
<i>and I was raped by two police officers.</i>

55:06.512 --> 55:10.062
<i>It went on for my junior and senior year.</i>

55:11.767 --> 55:13.727
<i>And I was gonna be something.</i>

55:13.810 --> 55:15.310
<i>I was gonna be somebody.</i>

55:15.395 --> 55:17.145
<i>I wanted to go to law school.</i>

55:19.566 --> 55:22.896
<i>But I ended up getting married</i>

55:22.986 --> 55:26.316
<i>and having children when I was 18, 19.</i>

55:27.407 --> 55:30.537
<i>And my whole life was put on hold.</i>

55:37.793 --> 55:39.963
[Beverly] <i> I mean, you gotta remember</i>
<i>this was many years</i>

55:40.045 --> 55:43.875
<i>before the whole</i>
<i>Spotlight journalist thing in Boston.</i>

55:45.008 --> 55:48.098
And so, once we delved into it

55:48.178 --> 55:50.678
and once we sent out our flyers
and ran an ad...

55:52.099 --> 55:56.229
<i>I think we expected</i>
<i>to get some modest response.</i>

56:00.482 --> 56:03.572
<i>What we got instead</i>
<i>was an overwhelming response.</i>

56:08.824 --> 56:10.414
<i>The P.O. Box filled up.</i>

56:10.867 --> 56:11.907
<i>"I got your letter."</i>

56:12.286 --> 56:14.326
<i>Or "I saw your ad in the paper."</i>

56:14.871 --> 56:16.541
<i>"I think I have some information."</i>

56:18.000 --> 56:19.210
-[woman 1] <i>August 13th.</i>
-[woman 2] <i>August 15th.</i>

56:19.293 --> 56:21.673
-[woman 3] <i>August 25th.</i>
-[all] ...<i>1993.</i>

56:21.753 --> 56:23.093
[woman 3]
<i>To whom it may concern...</i>

56:23.171 --> 56:25.171
-[woman 4] <i>I received your letter...</i>
-[woman 5] <i>In regards...</i>

56:25.257 --> 56:27.047
-[woman 6] <i>In response to your ad...</i>
-[woman 7] ...<i>your ad in the </i> Sun <i> today...</i>

56:27.134 --> 56:30.354
[woman 8] <i>I'm aware of sexual impropriety</i>
<i>at Archbishop Keough High...</i>

56:30.429 --> 56:32.469
-[woman 9] <i>...between '68...</i>
-[woman 7] <i>...and 1975.</i>

56:32.889 --> 56:34.219
<i>I can offer the following.</i>

56:35.017 --> 56:38.517
[Beverly] <i> We got probably 40 to 50 people</i>
<i>that contacted us.</i>

56:39.605 --> 56:44.105
And thus began over a year
of interviewing these witnesses,

56:44.192 --> 56:45.742
learning what their stories were.

56:47.321 --> 56:50.991
<i>And everybody that called said,</i>
<i>"We're talking about Father Maskell."</i>

56:51.074 --> 56:53.664
[woman 1] <i>Father Maskell</i>
<i>practiced psychology, according to him...</i>

56:53.744 --> 56:56.584
-[woman 2] <i>...about Father Maskell.</i>
-[woman 3] <i>Father Maskell called me</i>

56:56.663 --> 56:58.673
<i>into his office</i>
<i>and asked me to sit on his lap.</i>

56:58.749 --> 57:00.709
-<i>He rocked me back and forth.</i>
-[woman 4] <i>...amnesia</i>

57:00.792 --> 57:02.922
<i>-regarding large portions of time...</i>
-[woman 5] <i>...I couldn't wait to get out.</i>

57:03.003 --> 57:05.513
<i>-Made me uncomfortable.</i>
-[woman 6] <i>Had me in tears, made me feel</i>

57:05.589 --> 57:08.929
<i>-like I really did have these problems.</i>
-[woman 7] <i>I regretted not telling anyone.</i>

57:09.009 --> 57:10.759
[woman 8] <i> It makes me sick</i>
<i>to think about it.</i>

57:10.844 --> 57:12.224
[woman 9] <i> He made me feel confused.</i>

57:12.304 --> 57:14.474
[woman 10] <i>I have information</i>
<i>regarding Father Maskell.</i>

57:14.848 --> 57:17.638
[Beverly] <i> I think what surprised me</i>
<i>in the response</i>

57:17.726 --> 57:20.306
were the consistent threads
that kept showing up.

57:20.395 --> 57:26.065
Anything from inappropriate conversations
to the rapes.

57:27.069 --> 57:31.409
<i>He was very big into examinations.</i>

57:31.490 --> 57:34.910
<i>He was doing pelvic examinations</i>
<i>on these girls in his office,</i>

57:34.993 --> 57:37.083
<i>what he called pregnancy checks.</i>

57:39.373 --> 57:41.833
<i>And he had been involved in...</i>

57:44.461 --> 57:47.051
<i>gynecological care of students.</i>

57:48.799 --> 57:51.719
<i>Also, we heard from more than one person</i>

57:51.802 --> 57:54.012
that there were other people
brought in and--

57:54.096 --> 57:56.516
Who performed sexual acts and raped
on these girls

57:57.140 --> 57:59.430
<i>at the behest of Maskell,</i>

57:59.518 --> 58:01.898
<i>or certainly with his permission</i>
<i>and his presence.</i>

58:03.063 --> 58:06.573
<i>There were police officers,</i>
<i>there were other clergy members,</i>

58:06.650 --> 58:09.240
<i>there were local business owners,</i>

58:09.319 --> 58:12.949
<i>there were politicians</i>
<i>that all were part of this network.</i>

58:18.078 --> 58:22.958
The real screamer
is that, here a family, kids and all,

58:23.041 --> 58:25.341
<i>involved, do this and where's--?</i>

58:25.419 --> 58:29.129
<i>Where's the archdiocese going out</i>
<i>and dusting the troops and saying:</i>

58:29.214 --> 58:30.514
<i>"Hey, was there anything there?"</i>

58:31.383 --> 58:33.763
If we hadn't done that, who knows?
It may not have--

58:33.844 --> 58:36.184
It may not have took off
as much as it did.

58:37.848 --> 58:41.228
People coming forward, you would think
it would give you some sense of...

58:41.977 --> 58:45.477
of... legitimizing what you're saying.

58:48.442 --> 58:52.282
<i>But that all scared me more</i>
<i>because it made it more real.</i>

58:53.864 --> 58:56.584
You know, it's one thing
when you think you're crazy

58:56.658 --> 58:58.738
and you're the only person
that remembers this.

58:58.827 --> 59:00.327
It's easy to think you're crazy.

59:03.331 --> 59:07.211
<i>But it wasn't crazy</i>
<i>if other people had experienced it, too.</i>

59:08.086 --> 59:11.126
And if it wasn't crazy,
then this horrible thing happened to me.

59:11.214 --> 59:15.014
And if this horrible thing happened to me,
oh, my God.

59:18.972 --> 59:20.772
<i>How many other girls were involved?</i>

59:22.809 --> 59:24.059
<i>How many of us are dead?</i>

59:24.144 --> 59:27.444
<i>How many of us are lost in alcohol</i>
<i>or drugs</i>

59:27.522 --> 59:29.192
<i>or in a mental hospital?</i>

59:32.360 --> 59:33.700
<i>What was done to us?</i>

59:45.373 --> 59:46.213
[truck horn honks]

59:47.375 --> 59:48.915
[Gemma] The matter with you, dude?

59:50.337 --> 59:52.127
He just thought I was cute.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.011
Holy Cross Cemetery. Okay.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:06.231
It just seems like this would have been
the place where you would--

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:11.267
If you were gonna get rid of something,
you would do it back in there.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.649
Maybe this is where it was.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:26.872
[Abbie] <i> We heard the story</i>
<i>that one day in 1990,</i>

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:32.456
<i>while Maskell was at Holy Cross,</i>
<i>there was a very bizarre episode.</i>

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:37.426
<i>The cemetery caretaker</i>
<i>was Mr. William Storey,</i>

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:41.179
and... Father Maskell suddenly told him
to get a front loader

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:43.473
and dig a hole ten-by-20 feet

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:46.182
in the back abandoned part
of the cemetery.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:52.731
<i>Maskell started bringing in a pickup truck</i>
<i>full of boxes wrapped in plastic.</i>

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:56.904
<i>They put all these boxes into the ground,</i>

01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:02.277
and Maskell told Mr. Storey
to backfill it in and put grass on top.

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:03.907
Nobody knew anything was there.

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:07.211
Well, Mr. Storey was pretty street smart,
it sounded like.

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:10.039
And while Maskell
was getting more documents,

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.915
<i>Mr. Storey climbed down into the hole</i>

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.632
<i>and opened one of the boxes</i>
<i>and looked at the documents.</i>

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:21.428
Father Maskell fired him
a couple months later.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.721
[Gemma]
Right.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:27.639
[Abbie] <i> And in August of 1994,</i>

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.768
<i>when Jane Doe came forward...</i>

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:35.565
<i>Mr. Storey went to a detective</i>
<i>who was off the record.</i>

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:41.323
<i>We've nicknamed him Deep Throat</i>
<i>from the...</i>

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.326
<i>from the old Watergate inside source.</i>

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:49.293
<i>Deep Throat says that Mr. Storey told him</i>
<i>the story and said:</i>

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.422
<i>"I know--</i>
<i>I don't know what all's down there,</i>

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:52.879
<i>but I know where it's buried."</i>

01:01:56.046 --> 01:02:00.216
<i>Deep Throat told us</i>
<i>that we need to be careful for our safety.</i>

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:02.759
That this goes bigger and deeper--

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.216
I think he said, "Than we can imagine."

01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:12.308
And that he doesn't wanna put himself,
or more importantly, his family, at risk,

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.981
by having his name used

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.606
<i>or telling us information</i>
<i>that might get us in trouble.</i>

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.908
[Tom] <i> What was in that hole</i>
<i>in the ground?</i>

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:34.793
<i>Deep Throat, he knows what happened.</i>

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:39.089
I've interviewed him half a dozen times...

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:40.921
been to meetings with him...

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.471
never seen him say anything
that didn't prove

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.432
to be 100 percent accurate.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:49.724
[interviewer] Why don't you think Deep
Throat would go on the record with anyone?

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:54.403
I believe there's a lot of fear
around this.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.898
<i>I believe people have been threatened.</i>

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:02.646
<i>I believe they have been shown weapons</i>
<i>and told not just...</i>

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.663
<i>"This could be very bad for you</i>
<i>if you get deeply into it,"</i>

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:08.911
<i>but, "Your family could pay the price."</i>

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.373
I can't...

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:17.337
ask Deep Throat to... confront his anxiety

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:21.049
about the threats
he believes he's received to his family.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.007
<i>But I think--</i>

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:26.431
I think many people wish
that he would come forward

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:30.101
and stand up to the camera
and tell the world.
