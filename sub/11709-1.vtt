14:50.848 --> 14:51.557
{\an8}- I GOT YOU, BRO.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.975
{\an8}HE DID THIS WHOLE THING.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.602
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT THIS?

14:54.685 --> 14:56.604

14:57.563 --> 14:59.815
{\an8}- I LIKE THAT.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.525

A FEAST FOR EVERYBODY.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.360
{\an8}THIS IS A CLASSIC
SITUATION DINNER

15:03.444 --> 15:04.820
{\an8}THAT I REMEMBER HAVING
THE FIRST SUMMER.

15:04.903 --> 15:08.574
{\an8}IT'S GOOD TO SEE EVERYBODY AND,
UM, GOOD TO SEE MIKE CHANGED.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.534
{\an8}- I QUIT--I QUIT
THE HARD SHIT.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.161
{\an8}I RUN FOUR MILES A DAY.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.746
{\an8}LIKE, I--YOU KNOW,
I'M, LIKE,

15:13.829 --> 15:15.289
{\an8}THE MOST HEALTHIEST

15:15.372 --> 15:17.499
{\an8}- CAN I ASK
WHAT MADE YOU STOP?

15:17.583 --> 15:20.002
{\an8}- UM, NO,
I WAS JUST EXHAUSTED.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.211
{\an8}I WAS SO TIRED
AND JUST NEEDED--

15:21.295 --> 15:23.088
{\an8}JUST WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP,
YOU KNOW?

15:23.172 --> 15:25.716
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, "WOW,

15:25.799 --> 15:27.343
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
WHAT'S--

15:27.426 --> 15:29.094
{\an8}- IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN
WANNA GET UP

15:29.178 --> 15:30.471
{\an8}AND PISS AFTER A WHILE.
- YEAH, PUT MY HANDS UP.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.847
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, "MAN,
I CAN'T DO THIS NO MORE."

15:31.930 --> 15:33.724
{\an8}SO THEN THAT WAS IT.
I HAD TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.768
{\an8}I WENT AWAY FOR 34 DAYS.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.603
{\an8}- CHEERS TO THAT.

15:37.686 --> 15:38.395
{\an8}CHEERS, BRO.
- GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.064
{\an8}- GOOD JOB, BRO.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.523
{\an8}[laughter]

15:41.607 --> 15:42.691
{\an8}- SHOTS! SHOTS!

15:42.775 --> 15:46.320
{\an8}- THIS IS THE PERFECT WAY
TO START OFF THE SUMMER.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.696
{\an8}LIKE, IT FEELS GOOD
TO BE BACK.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.698
{\an8}- LET'S ALL GO
IN THE HOT TUB TONIGHT. WHOO!

15:49.782 --> 15:51.158
{\an8}- REMEMBER THE FIRST NIGHT?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.910
{\an8}RON'S MOTORBOATIN' NICOLE,
SLAPPING HER ASS.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.411
{\an8}- SHE JUMPED ON ME
BREASTS-FIRST.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.871
{\an8}- EWW.

15:55.954 --> 15:56.664
{\an8}- YO, WE WERE TRIPLE-KISSING
SOME CONNECTICUT CHICKS.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.040
{\an8}- YEAH, BRO.
- [laughs]

15:58.123 --> 16:01.210
{\an8}- YO, WE HAD
SOME UGLY-ASS CHICKS IN HERE.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.586
{\an8}- YO, AND THEN SAMMI
AND ANGELINA WERE LIKE,

16:02.670 --> 16:03.837
{\an8}"OH, THOSE GIRLS
ARE GROSS."

16:03.921 --> 16:05.005
{\an8}- IF THEY WANNA GET IT IN,
LET 'EM GET IT IN.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.257
{\an8}[laughter]
- I DON'T KNOW, GUYS.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.842
{\an8}BEFORE WE GO OUT OR WHATEVER
FOR THE NIGHT,

16:08.926 --> 16:10.094
{\an8}I JUST WANNA SAY SOMETHING
TO EVERYBODY.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.804
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW IN THE LAST--
- [giggling]

16:11.887 --> 16:13.514
{\an8}- SHUT THE FUCK UP, BRO,
YOU ASSHOLE.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.807
{\an8}I'M FUCKING TALKING, BRO.

16:14.890 --> 16:15.766
{\an8}- I DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU WERE JOKIN'.

16:15.849 --> 16:16.809
{\an8}- I'M SERIOUS.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.560
{\an8}I JUST WANNA SAY
ONE MOTHERFUCKING THING.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.895
{\an8}IN DIFFERENT WAYS,
I FEEL

16:19.978 --> 16:21.855
{\an8}LIKE I LET
ALMOST EVERYBODY DOWN.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.441
{\an8}PAULY, YOU KNOW,
I LET OUR FRIENDSHIP DOWN.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.776
{\an8}VINNY, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE

16:25.859 --> 16:27.069
{\an8}TOO WILD AND CRAZY
AND STRESSED YOU OUT AND STUFF.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.738
{\an8}AND I TOTALLY LET
OUR FRIENDSHIP DOWN, SNOOKI.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.448
{\an8}I'M, LIKE, VERY UPSET
ABOUT THAT.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.992
{\an8}AND, RONNIE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
I WAS A LITTLE COMBATIVE

16:34.076 --> 16:35.494
{\an8}AND MEDDLESOME
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.537
{\an8}AND I REALLY DO APOLOGIZE.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.163
{\an8}YOU GUYS REALLY DO MEAN
A LOT TO ME.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.415
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT
I WAS WAITIN' FOR.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.624
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

16:40.708 --> 16:41.834
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT I WAS
WAITING FOR.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.294
{\an8}- IT'S NICE FOR HIM TO JUST SAY,
"I FUCKED UP.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.754
{\an8}I'M SORRY."

16:45.838 --> 16:48.257
{\an8}BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK WE CAN
EVER HAVE THAT BOND EVER AGAIN.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.758
{\an8}BECAUSE I COULD FORGIVE MIKE,

16:49.842 --> 16:51.927
{\an8}BUT I COULD NEVER
FORGET IT.

16:52.010 --> 16:52.636
{\an8}- YOU MANNED UP,
INSTEAD OF EVERYTHING

16:52.720 --> 16:53.971
{\an8}JUST FIGURING ITSELF OUT.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.849
{\an8}YOU ACTUALLY TOOK
THE INITIATIVE.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.308
{\an8}- I JUST WANTED TO SAY
REAL QUICK I APOLOGIZE.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.601
{\an8}AND IF YOU WANNA WAIT AND SEE,
THAT'S COOL.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.812
{\an8}- I'LL TAKE THE WAIT AND SEE.
- THAT'S FINE.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.439
{\an8}YOU CAN DO THAT. THAT'S COOL.
- PROVE ME--

17:03.522 --> 17:04.940
{\an8}PROVE MY DOUBTS WRONG.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.066
{\an8}- AT LEAST LET ME SAY IT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.693
{\an8}AT LEAST LET ME SAY
THAT I APOLOGIZE.

17:07.776 --> 17:08.944
{\an8}I'M SORRY.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.113
{\an8}- I'M NOT GONNA TRUST MIKE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.614
{\an8}I MEAN, HE ACTS
LIKE HE'S GREAT,

17:12.698 --> 17:16.201
{\an8}AND THEN HE GOES OFF
AND, LIKE, LIES AND SCHEMES.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.078
{\an8}AND, THEREFORE,
IT'S VERY HARD TO TRUST HIM.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.623
{\an8}BUT I'LL PLAY BALL
UNTIL PROVEN WRONG.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.125
{\an8}- I FORGOT TO--

17:23.208 --> 17:25.502
{\an8}I NEVER CONGRATULATED SNOOKI
ON HER PREGNANCY

17:25.586 --> 17:26.587
{\an8}AND HER ENGAGEMENT.
- THANKS.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.130
{\an8}- WAIT, ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO CONGRATULATE HER

17:28.213 --> 17:29.173
{\an8}FOR BEING KNOCKED UP?
- I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED

17:29.256 --> 17:33.093
{\an8}TO CONGRATULATE VINNY FOR THAT.
