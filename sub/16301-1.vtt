01:53.280 --> 01:58.411
"I'll do it my way"

02:01.747 --> 02:05.748
"Is that what you do?"

02:09.964 --> 02:13.935
"Is that what you do?"

"Slowly around me"

03:49.396 --> 03:51.317
Okay, you motherfuckers, gimme your shit!

03:56.528 --> 03:59.723
Wake up, man. What d'you got? Come here.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.584
- Give me everything you got.
- I don't have anything.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.223
Yeah, motherfucker!

05:22.323 --> 05:23.724
You still wanna use it now, huh?

05:23.824 --> 05:26.227
You want to touch my shit again, huh?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.354
Say, "I'll never touch
your shit again, Skillet."

05:28.454 --> 05:31.899
Say, "I'll never touch
your shit again, Skillet." Say it!

05:31.999 --> 05:34.790
Get your funky ass out of here,
move it. Get out!

05:35.794 --> 05:40.366
What? What, motherfucker? What?

05:40.466 --> 05:43.285
You want my fucking skillet?
You want my fucking skillet?

05:43.385 --> 05:45.537
I killed a motherfucker to get this skillet.
You got that?

05:45.637 --> 05:47.638
Killed a motherfucker.
I'll kill your ass, too.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.668
Where are you going, bitch?

05:50.768 --> 05:53.712
I ain't finished with you. Oh, you take
another step, you're a dead motherfucker.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.465
Take another step! Oh, you dead motherfucker.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.678
You dead motherfucker.
I'll kill your motherfucking ass. You dead.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.513
All of you are dead motherfuckers!

06:02.613 --> 06:04.874
All of you are dead motherfuckers!

06:07.117 --> 06:11.146
- Holy shit. Look at that dude.
- Nope. Keep walking.

06:11.246 --> 06:14.400
- God! Downtown is the shit.
- Dude, don't be a jackass.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.527
Come on. This place is awesome.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.320
Skillet the killer!

06:18.420 --> 06:21.671
All of you are dead motherfuckers.
All of you. Skillet the killer.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.110
- Hey, Pope!
- Hey, Pope!

06:42.861 --> 06:46.307
- Hey, Jazz. How you feel, baby?
- What's up?

06:46.407 --> 06:48.017
Nothing happening, man.

06:48.117 --> 06:50.811
Yeah, I head some knuckleheads
tore up through here last night.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.565
Yeah. Two guys in a blue van
robbed everybody.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.859
- Everybody all right?
- I guess.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.861
Tore everybody's shit up, though.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.155
Yeah. I feel you, man.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.115
How's Methuselah?

07:03.215 --> 07:04.867
He's all right.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.508
Where is he?

07:07.803 --> 07:08.787
Hey, Methuselah!

07:08.887 --> 07:11.468
Let me see you, man.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.503
Hey, Jazz, do me a favor.
Keep an eye out on him, all right?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.089
He's too old to be out here
in the first place, you know?

07:19.189 --> 07:21.175
Yeah, we got him.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.509
I'ma put some feelers out

07:22.609 --> 07:24.720
and tell the boys to look out for these guys.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.055
What were they? Black, white...

07:26.155 --> 07:29.141
- Latino. Yeah.
- Some Spanish niggers?

07:29.241 --> 07:32.662
Yeah, well, we're gonna La Cucaracha
their ass when we catch him.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.774
- Thanks, Pope.
- Right on, baby. Stay up!

07:36.874 --> 07:39.635
- Look after yourselves.
- Take it easy, man.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.673
Hey, Pope.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.469
Hey.

07:49.470 --> 07:53.791
So... yeah, they, uh...

07:53.891 --> 07:55.232
they took my sleeping bag.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.061
That's fucked up, man.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.424
Yeah, it gets really
cold out here at night.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.928
Yeah? What? You want me to go
buy you a brand new sleeping bag?

08:06.028 --> 08:07.805
That would be nice, right?

08:07.905 --> 08:10.307
Look, I'm a minute off the streets
my damned self, okay?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.184
No, no. I'm sorry. I... no.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.936
- Sorry, man, you know.
- Thank you, though.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.979
All right, man. I can't
do nothing for you.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.500
No, I got it.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.093
Hey!

08:32.011 --> 08:34.222
- Hey, Pope.
- Look, nigga...

08:37.518 --> 08:39.669
I'm gonna give you this, all right?

08:39.770 --> 08:43.424
Now, I'm letting you hold it. But when you
find something else I want that back, okay?

08:43.524 --> 08:46.176
- Okay.
- And I swear to God if it smells like piss,

08:46.276 --> 08:47.761
I will run your ass over.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.639
Oh, there won't be any piss on it.

08:50.739 --> 08:51.723
Thank you.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.308
Yeah, all right, man.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.829
Hey, um...

08:58.789 --> 09:01.650
- What?
- How are you doing?

09:01.750 --> 09:05.404
Nigger, I can't spend my whole day
out here talking to your ass.

09:05.504 --> 09:08.073
Man, I got shit to do, and I already
gave you the fucking blanket.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.658
- What? You want me to change my mind?
- No.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.661
Keep fucking around
I'm taking my shit back, man.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.892
See you later.

10:01.018 --> 10:04.059
You can have it all. It's... it's all burned.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.150
All burned up.

10:48.899 --> 10:52.553
Dear diary, I am in the second grade.

10:52.653 --> 10:57.558
Mommy gave me this diary on the
Christmas before she went to heaven.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.185
She told me to write in it every day,

11:00.285 --> 11:03.605
because every day of my life
would be special.

11:03.705 --> 11:08.402
I asked her, "Why?" And she said because
she loved me more than life itself.

11:08.502 --> 11:13.949
And when someone loves you that much,
then you're special "automcly."

11:14.049 --> 11:19.288
When I get to heaven, I want to be able
to tell her about every day I was alive,

11:19.388 --> 11:21.790
and I don't want to forget anything.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.793
I will even tell her about the days I was bad

11:24.893 --> 11:28.005
and the days that I didn't do
anything at all.

11:28.105 --> 11:31.383
So, today, I started my diary, of course...

11:31.483 --> 11:33.534
and now I'm going to sleep.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.173
Excuse me.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.405
Do you know how to read cursive?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.574
Do you know how to read this?

11:55.674 --> 11:57.515
Get the fuck out of here. Move on.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.105
Heavenly father,
I know I've made some mistakes in my life.

12:27.205 --> 12:30.025
I know I've done some... some bad things.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.903
I'm a sinner and I deserve to go to hell.

12:33.003 --> 12:36.406
But you sent your son
to forgive me for my sins.

12:36.506 --> 12:41.967
And today, Jesus, I accept you into
my heart as my personal lord and savior.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.273
You can open your eyes now.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.307
You've been saved.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.848
Here, this is yours.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.529
I'll look for you in heaven.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.933
Ma'am. Hi, how are you?

13:03.033 --> 13:07.145
Excuse me. Can you read out
of this book it... it's in cursive.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.956
I can't, right now. I'm...

13:10.123 --> 13:11.214
Read the Bible.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.048
Hi, ma'am. Do you believe
in God by any chance?

13:17.380 --> 13:19.825
Good.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.676
I'd like to, uh... I'd like to show you
a verse here from the Bible.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.643
It's John 3:16. You know who John was?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.041
Mommy, something stinks.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.951
If you would pay for these cards, uh...

14:03.051 --> 14:05.203
uh, I know I smell bad.

14:05.303 --> 14:07.014
And I, uh... I'll wait outside.

14:25.824 --> 14:26.875
Thank you.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.637
It thundered the night my mom died.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.275
I'm afraid of thunder.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.521
I'm afraid of thunder, too.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.424
My name is Willie.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.970
I found your diary and thought
I would write you back

15:45.070 --> 15:46.721
if you don't mind.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.349
Maybe, we could be pen pals.

15:49.449 --> 15:54.229
But to do that, I guess I have
to tell you a little bit about myself.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.023
I live on the nickel.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.068
In the morning I wake up
when the sun comes out

16:00.168 --> 16:03.280
and go look for food.

16:03.380 --> 16:08.827
I'm always so hungry in the morning.
I will eat just about anything.

16:08.927 --> 16:12.758
After that, I walk around
trying to get money.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.959
Sometimes I just go exploring.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.878
I like to climb stuff.

16:17.978 --> 16:21.464
I found this roof I can climb up to.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.825
You can see the whole city
for a long, long way.

16:29.906 --> 16:33.197
When it gets real hot, I sleep in my box.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.147
It's a good box.

16:37.247 --> 16:42.338
And sometimes I sleep almost all day
because I stay up so late at night.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.864
It's really scary at night.

16:45.964 --> 16:50.869
If you sleep, somebody might do
something bad to you.

16:50.969 --> 16:55.874
These guys, they took my sleeping bag
one time and now it's really cold at night,

16:55.974 --> 16:57.645
which also makes me sad.

16:59.019 --> 17:02.610
So, I am what is called
a "night owl" right now.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.989
It is usually quiet, but it is lonely.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.073
You're the only person I know.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.768
So, that makes you special...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.199
"automcly."

17:23.001 --> 17:24.092
P.S...

17:25.252 --> 17:27.674
I am afraid of thunder, too.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.356
Dear diary...

17:51.613 --> 17:53.784
today was my first day at my new school.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.731
I'm living with Uncle Craig
in his apartment downtown,

18:01.831 --> 18:03.483
and I don't know anybody here.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.674
What?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.614
Back! This is my spot now.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.449
Go and find your own damn spot.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.244
Who wants your shit?

18:14.344 --> 18:15.870
Everyone stares at me weird,

18:15.970 --> 18:17.261
and I don't like it.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.114
There are a few kids
I want to make friends with...

18:27.982 --> 18:29.653
but they don't know I exist.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.764
When Mommy was sick, I used to hug her,

18:34.864 --> 18:37.851
and she said it made everything okay.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.687
She promised that whenever I get lonely

18:40.787 --> 18:42.618
she will send an angel down to hug me.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.544
But I haven't seen him yet.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.046
Hey, who wants 50 bucks?

18:51.923 --> 18:53.634
Yo, who wants 50 bucks?

18:55.426 --> 18:59.122
- Get in fights a lot?
- Get in 'em? I start 'em!

18:59.222 --> 19:00.749
Ask anybody on this row,

19:00.849 --> 19:02.584
anybody in this whole fucking city,

19:02.684 --> 19:05.420
and they'll tell you,
"Skillet the killer, motherfucker."

19:05.520 --> 19:06.796
You kill people?

19:06.896 --> 19:07.857
Yeah, I kill them.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.383
Beat 'em, eat 'em.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.093
Anybody... ask any one of these...

19:12.193 --> 19:14.304
pick any one of these sorry motherfuckers,

19:14.404 --> 19:16.723
any one of them...

19:16.823 --> 19:19.059
and I'll beat their ass.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.977
Yeah, how much?

19:21.077 --> 19:23.021
What do you mean "how much"?

19:23.121 --> 19:26.122
How much... how much to see you
fight somebody right now?

19:27.792 --> 19:30.945
Right now? Shit. How much you got?

19:31.045 --> 19:32.864
I got $50.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.200
Get the fuck out of here,
get off of my row.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.285
There's no fight. $50 ain't shit.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.622
Sure, it is. Hey, who wants 50 bucks, huh?

19:40.722 --> 19:44.167
Raise your hand if you want 50 bucks.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.518
Hmm?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.058
Anybody?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.196
Hey, buddy.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.267
You wanna make some money? Huh?

20:01.367 --> 20:02.519
What do you say?

20:02.619 --> 20:04.562
Come on. You go... you wanna make a 50?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.856
Dead motherfucker!

20:06.956 --> 20:10.068
Oh shit!

20:10.168 --> 20:12.487
Yo, yo, dude, we're on!
We're on! Fucking film this, man!

20:12.587 --> 20:14.418
Whoa! Fucking film!

20:22.347 --> 20:23.508
Come on!

20:24.557 --> 20:25.598
Jesus!

20:34.400 --> 20:36.845
Dead motherfucker. Get up.

20:36.945 --> 20:39.356
No, man, don't let
anybody do that shit to you.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.895
- Yo, what's his name?
- Come on, man!

20:45.995 --> 20:47.021
Yeah, man!

20:47.121 --> 20:48.982
Hey! Come on, Willie!

20:49.082 --> 20:51.503
You've got to get back up.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.345
Yeah!

20:58.341 --> 21:01.222
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Hit him in the face.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.769
Kill him now!

21:17.860 --> 21:20.221
Dude, he's messing him up pretty bad.
Maybe we should just call it, huh?

21:20.321 --> 21:21.532
Fucking film.

21:22.740 --> 21:23.831
Get up!

21:25.618 --> 21:27.619
Come on, Willie!

21:40.925 --> 21:43.886
Come on, Willie! Come on, boy!

21:49.434 --> 21:50.565
Yeah.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.945
Hey! Hey, that's enough!

22:00.987 --> 22:02.408
That's enough! He's had enough.

22:05.158 --> 22:09.103
Whoo! Willie, you fucking won! Ha!

22:09.203 --> 22:10.813
Dude, I thought you were dead

22:10.913 --> 22:13.504
for sure, motherfucker! Oh my...

22:14.625 --> 22:16.277
You fucking won, Willie!

22:16.377 --> 22:18.029
Yo, pay him motherfucker.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.489
Yeah, yeah. No problem.

22:19.589 --> 22:20.840
None whatsoever.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.079
Willie!

22:26.179 --> 22:29.916
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together for Willie.

22:30.016 --> 22:34.379
My main man, Willie the Cardboard Boxer!

22:34.479 --> 22:36.798
Whoo! You get that?

22:36.898 --> 22:38.229
Go, Willie!

24:42.648 --> 24:44.479
Hey, man. You need some help?

24:46.194 --> 24:48.638
- What?
- Here, let me push you.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.264
Get the fuck off of me, man!

24:50.364 --> 24:51.625
I got it.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.831
Hey, do you know how to read cursive?

25:00.875 --> 25:02.026
What?

25:02.126 --> 25:03.528
Do you know how to read cursive?

25:03.628 --> 25:06.572
Yeah, I know how
to read cursive, motherfucker.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.367
Then if you read this,
I will push you up the hill.

25:09.467 --> 25:10.952
You wanna read this?
I ain't readin' you shit!

25:11.052 --> 25:13.473
- Hey! Don't do that!
- Get the fuck off of me!

25:26.817 --> 25:28.028
You know where the pawn shop is?

25:36.285 --> 25:38.521
Aha, you thought I was lying, right?

25:38.621 --> 25:40.148
Whoa! Is that really him?

25:40.248 --> 25:42.275
Yeah, it's President
of the United States, bro!

25:42.375 --> 25:44.152
And me, you see that?

25:44.252 --> 25:46.154
You believe that?

25:46.254 --> 25:47.465
I'll show you something.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.784
What! Purple Heart.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.369
Wow!

25:53.469 --> 25:55.663
You know what the President
said when he gave that to me?

25:55.763 --> 25:57.373
He said, "I thank you on the behalf

25:57.473 --> 26:00.209
"of the American people.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.879
I thank you for your service.
You're a real life hero, Pinky."

26:02.979 --> 26:04.255
"Pinky"?

26:04.355 --> 26:06.382
Yeah, that's my nickname, son.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.802
I told him. I was like,
"You call me anything, you call me Pinky."

26:09.902 --> 26:11.387
Shit. Can you believe that, though?

26:11.487 --> 26:13.890
You're pushing an honest-to-God
war hero, motherfucker.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.701
Iraqi War hero.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.103
Why did they call you "Pinky"?

26:19.203 --> 26:23.357
Because I used to wear a fucking
dope-ass pinky ring.

26:23.457 --> 26:26.819
But I pawned that shit
just like I wanna pawn this shit.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.571
Yo, take me in.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.239
Are you out of your fucking mind, sir?

26:30.339 --> 26:32.130
That's a Purple Heart right there.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.355
You ain't from America, though, are you?
Where you from, my man?

26:37.805 --> 26:38.748
Pakistan.

26:38.848 --> 26:43.169
Pakistan? Fucking figures. God!

26:43.269 --> 26:46.589
They only give them to war heroes.
That's a Purple Heart, right there.

26:46.689 --> 26:48.132
Understand it? To... to heroes!

26:48.232 --> 26:49.800
I know what it is. I'll...

26:49.900 --> 26:52.241
I'll give you $15.

26:54.322 --> 26:57.975
My man you said 50 or 15?
Because I know you said 50. Come on.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.603
- 15.
- 15?

27:00.703 --> 27:03.064
Very few want to buy this.
It's... it's worthless.

27:03.164 --> 27:06.005
It's fucking not worthless, man.
It's my legs right there.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.882
You... you want to...
you want to sell this to me or not?

27:27.438 --> 27:29.340
Fuck you, man.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.551
Keep your money, bro.
I don't need your money.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.177
Let's go, Willie.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.930
Let's go. Let's go.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.140
Yo, yo. Let me tell you something, my man.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.060
This is me and the President
of the United States!

27:41.160 --> 27:44.272
A country you living in right now.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.691
Let me ask you something.
Who fucking knows you, bro?

27:46.791 --> 27:48.818
Nobody fucking knows you.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.988
Who knows you? Answer me.
No, nobody fucking knows you.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.489
Fuck you.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.630
Let's go, Willie. Nobody knows this guy.

27:57.218 --> 27:59.179
You're lucky I don't come back here, bro.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.072
This chicken looks okay.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.856
It's not bad.

28:16.570 --> 28:20.161
- It's got ants on it.
- I know there's fucking ants on that shit.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.251
That's an ant.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.120
God! You've been over there?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.913
No.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.184
Too shy.

28:47.268 --> 28:48.519
How much is it?

28:49.687 --> 28:51.808
$5 for a blow-job.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.069
$10 for a pussy.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.608
They're really nice.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.075
Yeah, I bet.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.796
I suppose you gotta be
in the band to get the girl.

29:18.716 --> 29:21.160
- You ever play in a band?
- Shit yeah, man!

29:21.260 --> 29:23.162
Played piano.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.563
Opened for the Dramatics when I was 15.

29:26.682 --> 29:27.813
You ever heard of them?

29:29.435 --> 29:32.171
No. You any good, though?

29:32.271 --> 29:34.612
On piano? I was good enough.

29:35.733 --> 29:38.177
Wasn't no Mozart and them.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.528
But, shit, you know,
it was just for fun, brother.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.557
Just fun, huh.

29:43.657 --> 29:47.978
Backstage this older girl...
she took me to the bathroom.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.789
Girls' bathroom. I got to finger her.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.794
Ah!

29:56.504 --> 29:58.114
Yeah, man.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.885
See, that's what you've got
to grasp on to, little brother.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.371
You gotta filter through the memories.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.392
Pick the best one and hold that shit tight.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.138
Let the rest of them fade away.

30:14.355 --> 30:17.186
What about you, Eavesdrop?
What you want to do, man?

30:20.736 --> 30:23.487
- What?
- You had any dreams when you was a kid?

30:26.784 --> 30:28.602
Yeah, I used to dream at night.

30:28.702 --> 30:33.774
Nah, I mean, if you could have anything
in the world that you want,

30:33.874 --> 30:35.135
what would you want?

30:42.591 --> 30:45.142
I don't want to be alone when I die.

30:51.267 --> 30:53.888
Shit. You got plenty of company
down here, man.

30:55.396 --> 30:57.017
You couldn't be alone if you tried.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.818
Believe me, I've tried.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.160
Dear diary...

31:11.245 --> 31:12.326
I'm so lonely.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.118
Other kids used to stare...

31:16.292 --> 31:17.843
but now no one looks at me.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.530
Uncle Craig hates me.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.825
I keep waiting for the angel
Mommy sent to hug me,

31:24.925 --> 31:26.046
but...

31:27.094 --> 31:28.579
there's no one there.

31:28.679 --> 31:29.970
Hey.

31:53.037 --> 31:55.958
Sometimes I wonder
if Mommy can even hear me.

31:57.124 --> 32:00.361
Maybe she's not there either anymore.

32:00.461 --> 32:03.739
Maybe you have someone
in your life for just a little while.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.510
And when they go, they're gone.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.353
And you're all alone.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.089
I know how it feels to be lonely.

32:20.189 --> 32:24.820
There have been long times
when I didn't talk to anyone at all.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.389
Sometimes people stare at me...

32:28.489 --> 32:31.684
and I don't like it.

32:31.784 --> 32:35.165
But other times,
I wish someone would see me...

32:36.497 --> 32:39.078
just to know I am here.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.112
But, you started talking to me...

32:43.212 --> 32:46.923
and then I started talking to other people.

32:47.925 --> 32:50.586
And now, I do have friends.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.971
You and Pinky.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.478
And if I can make friends...

32:57.810 --> 32:59.141
then you will make friends, too.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.066
So, don't worry.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.413
I hear you.

33:12.533 --> 33:16.254
And your mommy... she can hear you, too.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.460
I know you exist.

33:25.796 --> 33:29.575
P.S. There's going to be thunder, tonight.

33:29.675 --> 33:34.556
Don't be afraid, though,
'cause I'll be with you the whole time.

33:35.639 --> 33:38.480
Your friend, Willie.

34:18.599 --> 34:20.458
Happy new year, everybody!

34:20.559 --> 34:22.270
Happy new year!

34:38.534 --> 34:40.696
Yo! Easy.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.335
You know, I wouldn't smoke in the war.

34:55.511 --> 34:56.762
Mmm-mmm.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.001
Oh, that's real.

35:02.101 --> 35:04.128
Everybody in my unit,
they took up smoking,

35:04.228 --> 35:05.921
because they weren't thinking long term.

35:06.021 --> 35:09.049
They was all like, "Shit,
I'll be lucky to die of lung cancer."

35:09.149 --> 35:11.927
I'd be like, "Yeah, whatever. You 50

35:12.027 --> 35:14.138
"and dyin', and your wife
and your friends are still chillin'

35:14.238 --> 35:16.239
"with mad time ahead of 'em,
you gon' feel stupid."

35:17.282 --> 35:19.184
"Yo, yo, Pinky,

35:19.284 --> 35:22.771
you could die tomorrow or your ass
could get blown up by a mortar right now."

35:22.871 --> 35:26.002
"Yeah, but, If I don't,
I want to live to be an old-ass man."

35:30.963 --> 35:33.884
Now thinking about being
an old-ass man out here...

35:38.428 --> 35:40.639
I'd be lucky to die of lung cancer.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.711
Shit.

35:45.811 --> 35:49.022
Fucking went out
'cause I was fucking talking.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.843
What do you want your sign to say?

35:52.943 --> 35:56.494
"Give me you fucking money.
I ain't got no legs."

35:58.240 --> 36:01.081
No. You shouldn't use bad words.

36:02.786 --> 36:04.730
You should say "Veteran."

36:04.830 --> 36:07.001
Motherfucker, it's my sign.
I get to say what I want to say.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.666
Don't be getting creative.

36:11.461 --> 36:12.802
You should say "War Hero."

36:20.596 --> 36:21.637
Whoo!

36:27.561 --> 36:29.755
Whoa, hey. Hey, how are you doing, man?

36:29.855 --> 36:31.548
What's up, brother?
How are you doing, man?

36:31.648 --> 36:34.051
You got... you got any money to help
me out a little bit, today?

36:34.151 --> 36:36.178
- We thank you for your service.
- All right, all right.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.388
See you, honey. Thank you, thank you.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.891
Hey, honey. You got a little bit of cash?

36:40.991 --> 36:42.992
Go ahead. Put it... put it right here.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.813
If I had a phone, I'd call you.

36:45.913 --> 36:48.148
If I had a phone, I'd call you. You know?

36:48.248 --> 36:50.275
Hey, how are you guys doing tonight?

36:50.375 --> 36:52.152
- Keep that, sir.
- Whoa. I appreciate it.

36:52.252 --> 36:53.529
- Here.
- Thank you very much.

36:53.629 --> 36:55.656
Thank you. I appreciate it.
You look nice tonight.

36:55.756 --> 36:58.200
You look good. Thank you. Thank you.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.244
Hey, honey. How are you doing?

37:00.344 --> 37:02.830
Hey, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

37:02.930 --> 37:04.011
Thank you.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.564
Whoo!

37:09.645 --> 37:11.056
Willie!

37:21.031 --> 37:25.122
Hey, my man. Yo, we want...
one room, two beds.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.563
It's 120 for a night.

37:27.663 --> 37:28.814
What?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.255
What are you talking about? Sign says 60.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.208
Not for two person.

37:38.257 --> 37:41.298
Yeah, well. Just one, then.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.104
Check your sign, next time.

37:54.856 --> 37:57.259
What... I got it, man!

37:57.359 --> 37:58.780
I got it.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.829
Good night.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.997
Don't spend it all on girls.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.678
Peace out, man!

38:37.607 --> 38:39.009
No.

38:39.109 --> 38:41.136
This shit, man. This ain't me.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.639
Some movie set over off on Wilshire,

38:43.739 --> 38:45.807
they was about to throw 'em away,
can you believe that?

38:45.907 --> 38:46.892
You bullshitting me.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.769
No, man.

38:48.869 --> 38:52.022
Shit, if I had five loaves of bread
and two fish, I'd feed all of you.

38:52.122 --> 38:54.833
- Amen.
- Got one left, bro.

38:56.752 --> 38:58.213
Hey, sleeping bag man.

38:59.755 --> 39:01.782
Got one left. Want it?

39:01.882 --> 39:03.843
Oh, um...

39:07.012 --> 39:09.143
Methuselah, do you want a sandwich?

39:10.390 --> 39:11.959
Methuselah, come on over here, man.

39:12.059 --> 39:13.230
Get yourself some meat.

39:18.315 --> 39:20.175
DJ spinnin' tonight, huh?

39:20.275 --> 39:21.677
Yeah, he jamming, man.

39:21.777 --> 39:22.803
Hey, who's that?

39:22.903 --> 39:24.638
Yeah, you know what that means.

39:24.738 --> 39:25.806
What?

39:25.906 --> 39:27.157
He's gonna get him some pussy tonight.

40:25.799 --> 40:27.180
What do you want, Santa Claus?

40:31.471 --> 40:34.312
Ain't no bathrooms tonight.
It's all business.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.701
It's five bucks to play,
baby. You got five bucks?

41:01.877 --> 41:03.248
All right.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.784
Don't be nervous.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.935
Mama's gonna make it all right.

41:12.554 --> 41:14.581
Okay, what do we got down here,

41:14.681 --> 41:16.062
hmm?

41:17.476 --> 41:19.557
Wh... what? No.

41:23.732 --> 41:25.283
I'm sorry.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.606
It's okay.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.950
So what do you want to do?

41:37.287 --> 41:39.918
What do you want to do, then, Santy? Hmm?

41:41.166 --> 41:42.651
Do you...

41:42.751 --> 41:45.752
do you think that you can love me?

41:53.136 --> 41:54.347
Mmm-hmm.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.626
I do love you.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.837
Mmm-hmm.

42:01.937 --> 42:03.648
I love you, sweetie.

42:04.689 --> 42:05.980
Mmm-hmm.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.694
I love you.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.875
I love you. Mmm.

42:26.461 --> 42:31.825
"Goodbye, my friend"

42:31.925 --> 42:36.756
"You want be anymore with me"

42:38.723 --> 42:44.296
"Goodbye my friend"

42:44.396 --> 42:48.527
"I'm gonna bring your love with me"

42:50.819 --> 42:56.725
"Our way now splits in two,
just longing for an end"

42:56.825 --> 42:59.728
"But the road I have to run"

42:59.828 --> 43:02.959
"Is so long"

43:08.253 --> 43:11.174
Hit him again! Hit him!

43:25.604 --> 43:27.547
"What to say when he comes tonight"

43:27.647 --> 43:30.675
"With the memories, all right"

43:30.775 --> 43:33.512
"What to say when I see you"

43:33.612 --> 43:37.203
"And in time, holding on"

43:43.288 --> 43:45.209
You warm back there, buddy?

43:46.750 --> 43:48.318
Okay.

43:48.418 --> 43:51.863
So, Evan, let's talk biz.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.304
Tyler?

44:04.934 --> 44:08.105
If I send you a copy of this to show some of
your buddies, you think they'd be into it?

44:10.065 --> 44:11.424
Who?

44:11.524 --> 44:14.636
I know you know all those
finance kids and shit, man?

44:14.736 --> 44:16.763
That's who we gotta get down here, bro.

44:16.863 --> 44:18.974
That's gonna make it an event.

44:19.074 --> 44:20.335
Let's make this big.

44:22.661 --> 44:24.938
Dude, you know how fucking underground
they're gonna think you are

44:25.038 --> 44:26.439
when you show them this?

44:26.539 --> 44:29.500
Everybody's gonna be like,
"Shit, Evan is so street."

44:32.087 --> 44:34.088
For real, bro. You should think about it.

44:40.553 --> 44:43.873
Hey, Willie-bear. Here.

44:43.973 --> 44:47.043
Makes me feel good to put that
in your hand every time, man.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.336
You know that?

44:48.436 --> 44:51.057
I'm spending big money, but it feels good.

44:52.691 --> 44:55.010
I think it's 'cause I like you.

44:55.110 --> 44:57.012
Like that guy Evan,
who is technically one of my friends.

44:57.112 --> 44:58.638
I fucking hate that prick.

44:58.738 --> 45:00.659
But you, I, uh...

45:02.283 --> 45:04.769
I know it sounds weird
to call you my friend, but...

45:04.869 --> 45:06.479
I don't know, man. I...

45:06.579 --> 45:09.000
I honestly like you, Willie.

45:10.542 --> 45:14.303
You know why? I think... you're loyal.

45:15.588 --> 45:19.326
Yeah. But I'm going to need to count on you.

45:19.426 --> 45:21.047
Can I count on you, Willie?

45:22.178 --> 45:24.809
Yeah. Yeah.

45:25.849 --> 45:28.126
Yeah, you take good care of me.

45:28.226 --> 45:33.307
Yeah. I know I could. Bump it.

45:35.483 --> 45:38.154
You're my motherfucking
cardboard boxer, Willie.

46:32.081 --> 46:33.632
Willie.

46:35.335 --> 46:36.996
Help me light this.

46:54.813 --> 46:56.965
How the hell is it so cold?

46:57.065 --> 47:00.260
You know how like...
how you do in the movies,

47:00.360 --> 47:04.055
put the fire in the trash can.
You ever do that in real life?

47:04.155 --> 47:05.236
Yeah.

47:06.574 --> 47:08.495
I know where some of those are.

47:22.799 --> 47:24.284
Do you want me to read the first page?

47:24.384 --> 47:26.786
No, I know that one in my sleep.

47:26.886 --> 47:29.307
Read the last page that she wrote on.

47:32.892 --> 47:37.881
"I realized today that I didn't even say
a word at school all week.

47:37.981 --> 47:43.970
"Sometimes I am surprised by how my oice
sounds because I have not heard it in days."

47:44.070 --> 47:47.031
Uncle Craig is old and scary.

47:48.491 --> 47:50.602
He drinks beer and yells at me.

47:50.702 --> 47:54.083
He smokes his cigarettes until
he falls asleep on the couch.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.525
What is this shit, huh?

47:57.625 --> 48:00.737
You're gonna burn
the house down, stupid child!

48:00.837 --> 48:04.491
You're not supposed to be here.
Do you understand that?

48:04.591 --> 48:06.701
Go away!

48:06.801 --> 48:08.870
I wish I wasn't here, either.

48:08.970 --> 48:12.957
Sometimes I wish I could have
died with Mommy, when she died.

48:13.057 --> 48:18.228
"My life wouldn't have had this sad part.

48:19.898 --> 48:22.091
"The longer I am sad, the harder it is

48:22.191 --> 48:25.152
"to remember anything
ever good happened to me."

48:27.238 --> 48:29.140
I thought I was just sad...

48:29.240 --> 48:31.309
And it would get better,

48:31.409 --> 48:36.397
but now I think my life has turned sad
and that's the way it is from now on.

48:36.497 --> 48:38.900
I'm jealous of Mom.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.153
I want to go be in heaven with her.

48:42.253 --> 48:45.990
"We would be happy again...

48:46.090 --> 48:49.641
"and nobody down here would
ever know I left."

48:52.263 --> 48:54.564
What have you got me
reading this shit for, man?

49:26.839 --> 49:30.340
Pfft! Will you just stop liking me, man?

49:32.679 --> 49:34.060
You're my friend.

49:37.934 --> 49:41.525
No, I ain't no good guy.

49:43.272 --> 49:45.363
But you're a war hero.

49:50.780 --> 49:52.491
I killed a girl, man.

49:54.742 --> 49:56.352
These guys, they were shooting at us.

49:56.452 --> 49:59.083
They made her stand in front
when I shot back.

50:02.959 --> 50:06.090
Captain, he called it a "human shield,"
said it wasn't my fault that I shot her.

50:07.964 --> 50:09.595
Said I had to shoot her.

50:13.928 --> 50:15.429
But...

50:16.931 --> 50:18.642
But I chose to do it.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.842
I... I was just looking
own the barrel, man.

50:27.942 --> 50:30.903
Just wanted to make them
motherfuckers stop shooting back at me.

50:32.739 --> 50:34.240
And I saw her.

50:36.826 --> 50:39.617
I saw her. She was like... she was scared...

50:41.080 --> 50:43.441
and I still shot her.

50:43.541 --> 50:45.632
I saw smoke went up her chest.

50:50.423 --> 50:53.974
I just... I couldn't believe
they'd fucking do that to somebody.

50:58.139 --> 51:00.667
They didn't fucking care.

51:00.767 --> 51:03.978
They got so many people,
they can just... they just throw one away.

51:08.691 --> 51:10.492
You're liking me now, motherfucker?

51:13.071 --> 51:14.162
Yeah.

51:15.615 --> 51:17.141
Oh, God!

51:17.241 --> 51:19.042
You had to do it...

51:20.369 --> 51:22.330
so you could be here...

51:24.582 --> 51:26.150
and you could be my friend.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.986
Oh god.

51:28.086 --> 51:30.457
I... I gotta go, man. I gotta go.

51:53.861 --> 51:56.514
Check out my limousine.
Give me a ride, man.

51:56.614 --> 51:58.683
Yo, Willie-bear.

51:58.783 --> 52:01.561
What up, cardboard boxer?

52:01.661 --> 52:04.582
Brought me some fries.
You're down for another fight tonight?

52:08.292 --> 52:11.738
Yeah. Sure.

52:11.838 --> 52:14.129
Uh, can you find someone?

52:15.675 --> 52:16.966
I can do that.

52:18.845 --> 52:20.256
Come on.

52:23.015 --> 52:25.556
Hey. Nah, you're a girl.

52:27.770 --> 52:31.340
- Jazz, do you wanna fight?
- Nah, not me.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.401
Tell 'em it's 50 bucks.

52:35.778 --> 52:39.098
Hey, man. You wanna fight for $50?

52:39.198 --> 52:40.808
Fight you?

52:40.908 --> 52:42.789
Yeah.

52:45.538 --> 52:47.249
- Sure.
- Come on.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.212
Hey, this guy will do it.

52:55.756 --> 52:57.575
You got 50 bucks?

52:57.675 --> 52:59.202
Yeah. You down to fight?

52:59.302 --> 53:00.643
Where's the money?

53:01.846 --> 53:03.677
Cash is right here, buddy.

53:04.807 --> 53:06.167
How many rounds?

53:06.267 --> 53:08.377
Just 'til one of you says "uncle."

53:08.477 --> 53:11.714
Yeah, when he say "uncle," how do I know
you're not gonna just drive away?

53:11.814 --> 53:15.035
No, no, no. They'll pay you.
They're my friends.

53:18.112 --> 53:20.014
Place your bets, gentlemen.

53:20.114 --> 53:22.100
Whoo! All right, all right!

53:22.200 --> 53:24.644
Oh, I like it. Nice, nice.

53:24.744 --> 53:26.604
Okay. What have we got here, Evan?

53:26.704 --> 53:30.045
- Hey, buddy, good to see you.
- Whoo! Okay, let's get this started.

53:35.504 --> 53:37.740
Ready and fight!

53:37.840 --> 53:40.801
Yeah! That's it.

53:41.928 --> 53:44.122
Good.

53:44.222 --> 53:48.683
Yes! Nice, nice, nice. Get up.

53:59.028 --> 54:00.569
Fuck!

54:05.076 --> 54:07.728
Yeah! Nice.

54:07.828 --> 54:10.148
Whoa, whoa. Pay attention to...

54:10.248 --> 54:12.669
Get him! I got 200 on your ass!

54:16.420 --> 54:18.341
Come on, Willie.

54:22.635 --> 54:25.538
Yeah, that's my boy, Willie!

54:25.638 --> 54:27.219
That's my money!

54:28.808 --> 54:32.479
- Give me my money, motherfucker.
- JJ!

54:42.613 --> 54:44.284
JJ, let's go!

54:45.658 --> 54:47.393
JJ, come on.

54:47.493 --> 54:49.979
Fuck! Come on, let's go, man.

54:50.079 --> 54:52.690
Get in the fucking car, you piece of shit.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.461
Get in!

56:27.885 --> 56:29.676
Let's go. Move it.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.056
Come on, let's go. Get up.

56:52.368 --> 56:54.312
I need to take a trip,

56:54.412 --> 56:57.793
and you... you have to come with me, okay?

57:01.794 --> 57:03.635
Okay.

57:40.624 --> 57:42.385
This is my dad.

57:46.589 --> 57:51.160
He had to watch me grow up...

57:51.260 --> 57:55.391
from heaven. Just like your mommy
is watching you grow up from heaven.

57:59.310 --> 58:01.271
I don't know if he's happy or...

58:02.646 --> 58:05.591
if he's sad watching me.

58:05.691 --> 58:09.152
I didn't grow up so... so good.

58:11.906 --> 58:14.117
I didn't want him to have to see...

58:15.367 --> 58:16.948
all of the sad parts.

58:19.914 --> 58:21.982
But you have to remember...

58:22.082 --> 58:27.196
you don't wanna make
your mom sad in heaven, okay?

58:27.296 --> 58:30.047
You want her to be happy
when she's watching you.

58:31.842 --> 58:34.223
So don't make her sad, okay?

58:38.724 --> 58:40.435
I miss my dad.

58:43.229 --> 58:44.980
I'll say goodbye to him.

58:58.494 --> 59:00.295
Goodbye, Daddy.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.595
I'll see you soon.

59:28.148 --> 59:30.899
I have seen a lot of people die.

59:33.195 --> 59:37.766
And one day I know I will die.

59:37.866 --> 59:40.978
You start to wonder if people
will remember you

59:41.078 --> 59:44.899
as a good person or a bad person...

59:44.999 --> 59:47.380
or if they'll even remember you at all.

59:49.086 --> 59:51.697
That's why your mom was okay when she died,

59:51.797 --> 59:54.867
because she knew why she was here...

59:54.967 --> 59:56.638
to have you...

59:57.803 --> 59:59.830
and you're a good person.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:03.391
And you make me a better person.

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.298
And I don't have anything, but...

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:12.009
if you're getting these letters...

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:17.640
then maybe, my thing
could be that I helped you.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.871
Maybe I can be the angel
your mom sent to hug you.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.543
That would be enough for me.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.495
Pinky.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:26.101
You sleeping?

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:27.952
You sleeping, buddy?

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.684
It's pretty cold tonight.

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:48.016
I'm gonna put this around you. All right?

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.411
You have your picture?

01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:08.954
Yeah.

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:11.355
Yeah, that's good.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:13.866
You keep that close
to your heart, all right?

01:03:23.926 --> 01:03:26.677
Let me put this over your head, buddy.

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.636
It's so cold.

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.410
You're my only friend, Pinky.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.421
Who's Willie?

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:00.772
Which one is he?

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:06.614
You know where Willie's at?

01:05:09.448 --> 01:05:11.239
- Yeah, right there.
- Hey, Willie.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:13.977
Willie!

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.538
Get out!

01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:19.358
You Willie?

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:22.444
So you the motherfucker been beating up
on all these people for money?

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.029
Huh?

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:27.699
I'm not the only one.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:29.300
Wait a minute.

01:05:31.637 --> 01:05:33.258
I gave you my blanket.

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:36.637
Where's my fucking blanket, nigger?

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.734
I... I don't have it.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:43.465
Yeah, 'course you don't.

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:46.186
The way those kids have been
paying you to beat up my friends.

01:05:49.488 --> 01:05:51.598
You know who I'm talking about!
Them punk motherfuckers.

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:53.100
Who are they?

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.081
- They're my friends.
- Your friends?

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.397
They're not your friends, Willie.

01:05:58.497 --> 01:05:59.815
Yes, they are.

01:05:59.915 --> 01:06:02.401
Are they sleeping down here with you?

01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:04.922
They're not sleeping
in a goddamn box, are they?

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:07.781
They're not your friends.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.382
Are you out of your fucking mind
letting 'em do that shit?

01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:13.871
If they bring their ass on the nickel again,

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.762
I'm gonna knock the shit
out of them. You got that?

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.771
- No, you won't.
- No, I wont?

01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:20.936
Why?

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:23.773
I'll kill you.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.066
You're gonna fucking kill me?

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:30.742
Fuck your ass.

01:06:32.948 --> 01:06:36.699
They come here again,
some dead motherfuckers. You got that?

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:44.109
Where's your friends?

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:47.070
How come you're always down here
with us all the time?

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.511
You don't have any friends.

01:06:53.427 --> 01:06:54.888
This is my friend.

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:58.394
Watch your ass.

01:07:10.152 --> 01:07:11.903
You don't have any friends!

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.658
Nobody knows any of you!

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:18.560
Nobody knows you people!

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.331
They know me!

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:23.368
They know me!

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.377
They know me.

01:07:28.587 --> 01:07:30.588
I'm the cardboard boxer.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:37.218
What are you looking at?

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.663
Stupid.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:02.156
So stupid.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:10.207
You're stupid, Willie.

01:08:12.964 --> 01:08:14.135
You're stupid.

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:22.310
Just like everyone says. You're stupid.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:35.147
I don't think we should talk anymore.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:39.625
I'm not a good person.

01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:43.326
I hurt people.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:49.381
And I don't do it by accident.
I... I do it for money.

01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:55.532
I don't think I'll be seeing you
and your mother in heaven.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.013
I think I'm gonna have to go to hell.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.428
And it scares me.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:11.269
So, I won't be able to talk to you anymore.

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:16.149
But I wanted to thank you
for being my friend.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:23.413
You and Pinky were
the only friends that I had.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.544
I'm gonna go on and go pretty soon.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.651
Like you said, I, uh...

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:35.921
I don't want to have a big sad part
of my life anymore.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.756
But I wanted to say goodbye.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.102
Yeah.

01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:26.220
- What do you want me to tell him?
- I got it.

01:10:33.939 --> 01:10:35.465
Willie.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.843
I'm Staff Sergeant Thompson.

01:10:37.943 --> 01:10:40.887
I really appreciate your willingness
to serve your country.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:45.433
Unfortunately, you don't meet
our age requirements for enlistment.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:46.726
I'm sorry.

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:48.562
Please.

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:51.583
There's nothing I can do. It's a firm rule.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:55.902
Listen, if you need any help,

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:58.738
I can contact homeless shelters
in the area...

01:10:58.838 --> 01:11:00.549
I'll be a human shield.

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:03.410
What?

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:06.851
You can use me to protect
the soldiers from bullets.

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:10.559
You can just throw me away.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:14.713
I want you to.

01:11:14.813 --> 01:11:17.074
I want you to throw me away.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:52.042
All right, all right. Back up, back up.

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:53.835
Make some room. Come on.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.295
Ah!

01:11:55.395 --> 01:11:57.464
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:57.564 --> 01:11:59.090
I'm JJ,

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:00.842
your doorman to the poor man.

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:02.344
Now, tonight,

01:12:02.444 --> 01:12:04.012
as promised,

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:07.057
you're going to see something
you can't see anywhere else.

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:10.477
Two men fighting for their lives.

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:14.118
No time limits,
no judges' decisions, just real.

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:17.442
So, starting tonight

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.653
and every night you come down here,

01:12:19.753 --> 01:12:22.989
you're no longer business majors
or fucking trust fund babies.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.199
No, no, no, no.

01:12:24.299 --> 01:12:27.953
From now on, you are Romans,

01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:29.764
and these bums...

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.097
your gladiators.

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:35.752
So...

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:39.089
let's get this show started.
Who's up? Willie!

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:40.690
You out here?

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:44.325
Come on, Willie.

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:51.351
All right, no Willie.

01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:55.689
Uh... Who else? Who else?
Somebody else? A 100 bucks. Come on.

01:12:55.789 --> 01:12:59.442
What you all had a long day at work?
Come on! Hundred fucking bucks.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:00.673
Someone?

01:13:04.339 --> 01:13:06.825
For fuck's sake. Come on!

01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:10.046
Someone doesn't step up,
me and your money are leaving. For real.

01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:13.248
I'll do it.

01:13:13.348 --> 01:13:16.376
All right. Somebody still
got some balls to speak up.

01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:17.919
Methuselah, come on, man.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.190
- You don't need to do this, brother.
- All right.

01:13:21.356 --> 01:13:23.437
I'm hungry, man.

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:27.012
What about the rest of you?

01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:28.972
- Pope said, "No more fighting."
- Oh, the Pope?

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:31.808
- Yeah.
- "The Pope" said, "No more fighting"?

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.059
That's right.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:36.313
Well, yeah. The Pope's...

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:39.482
not putting food in your belly
tomorrow morning, is he?

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.923
No. I am.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:46.031
The only salvation out here, boys, is me.

01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:47.615
- Just get going.
- Come on, go.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:49.546
Willie!

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:54.039
I know you're out here, Willie-bear.

01:13:54.139 --> 01:13:55.970
Come on. Show yourself.

01:14:06.401 --> 01:14:08.553
What are you doing, man?
Come on. Get in here.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:10.513
Not tonight, JJ.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:11.723
"Not tonight, JJ"?

01:14:11.823 --> 01:14:13.224
What are you... what are you, my girlfriend?

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:14.601
Come on, cardboard boxer. Get in here.

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:16.292
This is your thing now.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:23.485
I need you, man. I brought all these...
these are important people.

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:24.819
I brought them all here for you.

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:26.363
Can you fucking be my friend?

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:28.114
Come on!

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:29.385
What the hell?

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.841
Look at that. Look at that old man.

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:34.913
Go ahead. Look at him.

01:14:35.013 --> 01:14:36.581
Look at that old man, right now.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:39.167
You want someone else to
throwing those punches at him? Hmm?

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:41.268
Or you wanna throw 'em?

01:14:50.612 --> 01:14:54.599
All right! Whoo! All right, we are on!

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:55.725
Folks!

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.394
For the first fight let's go with, uh,

01:14:57.494 --> 01:15:00.355
four to one odds on Methuselah
to go the distance. Yeah?

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:02.732
All right, thank you. Sounds good.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:05.151
- Take that. All of it. All of it.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:06.882
You don't have to do this.

01:15:09.214 --> 01:15:10.515
I'm sorry, Willie.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:14.395
Now, the bets are officially closed.

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:20.583
In this corner, the oldest man alive
coming direct to you from Skid Row...

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.210
Methuselah!

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.295
And in the other corner,

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:28.508
undefeated reigning champion
of all time, my good friend,

01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:32.762
Willie, the cardboard boxer.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:35.598
Whoo! Okay.

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:39.352
Three, two, one, fight!

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:40.953
Woo-hoo!

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:44.190
- Yo, man.
- What's going on?

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.984
Come on! Go!

01:15:46.084 --> 01:15:48.385
Come on. Get in there. Go, go, go.

01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:54.075
That's it.

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:55.493
Hit him!

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:56.995
Come on. What are you doing?

01:15:57.095 --> 01:15:58.663
Fight, come on!

01:15:58.763 --> 01:15:59.998
Hit him, come on!

01:16:00.098 --> 01:16:02.834
Oh! Oh!

01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:06.463
Oh, no, no! Get up, get up!
Whoa! What the fuck is this?

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:07.864
Hit me, hit me.

01:16:09.983 --> 01:16:11.176
- Get up!
- Hit me.

01:16:11.276 --> 01:16:13.678
Hit him! Wait. Stop.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:14.699
What the fuck?

01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:17.640
- No stopping. It's on.
- No, no, no. This isn't how it usually is.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:18.991
Willie, get the fuck up now!

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.728
- What is this? A fucking fix?
- Hit me.

01:16:21.828 --> 01:16:24.272
Willie, you do not get
to throw this, man. Get up!

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:27.567
- Upside! Upside!
- This is fucking bullshit. This is fixed.

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:30.570
This little motherfucker
is trying to rip us off.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.551
Hey, Willie. What do we got here?

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:35.450
- Huh?
- Wait.

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:36.721
Hey, hey, stop!

01:16:37.969 --> 01:16:39.913
Don't make me do this. Fucking hit him.

01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:42.207
- Don't, JJ! JJ!
- Hit him.

01:16:42.307 --> 01:16:44.083
- Fucking hit him!
- Don't burn her!

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.668
JJ, give him the book.

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:48.939
Don't make me tell you again, Willie.
Fucking hit him.

01:16:56.988 --> 01:16:58.973
I'm not gonna hit him.

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:00.164
Fine.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.161
No!

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:22.346
JJ, come on. JJ, come on!

01:17:41.616 --> 01:17:43.268
Sir...

01:17:43.368 --> 01:17:45.728
I'm going to leave this monitor on.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.522
Just speak up if you need anything.

01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:48.673
Okay?

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:28.959
My mommy gave me this diary...

01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:33.999
the Christmas before she went to heaven.

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:39.337
She told me to write in it every day...

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:42.926
because every day...

01:18:45.138 --> 01:18:47.429
that we're alive is special.

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:54.189
When someone loves you that much...

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.074
you're special "automcly."

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.744
So, when I get to heaven...

01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:11.328
I can tell her...

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:16.246
about every day that I was alive...

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:19.925
and I won't forget anything.

01:19:22.049 --> 01:19:23.326
I'll...

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:27.137
tell her about the days I was bad...

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:31.891
and I'll tell her about the days...

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.812
that I didn't do anything at all.

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:50.915
Now, I'm going to sleep.

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.420
Yo, you missed a turn.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:18.381
I didn't miss the fucking turn.

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:20.232
You're drunk.

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:23.112
Whoa! Look out!

01:20:30.117 --> 01:20:31.488
Hey, you got a problem?

01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:34.689
Yeah, I got two problems...

01:20:34.789 --> 01:20:36.960
but you boys got three.

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:45.742
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit, shit.

01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:46.909
Get out of the car.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:48.180
Don't get out of the car.

01:20:53.975 --> 01:20:57.628
Okay. Okay. He just wants the car, okay?

01:20:57.728 --> 01:21:00.882
- Fuck.
- I said, "Get out the car."

01:21:00.982 --> 01:21:02.363
Okay, you can give him the car.

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:10.948
Hey, man.

01:21:13.244 --> 01:21:16.522
You just take the car, okay? I... I got...

01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:18.357
I got 300 bucks right here.

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:19.998
We cool. We cool, man.

01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:22.862
I don't want your money or your car.

01:21:22.962 --> 01:21:25.513
I want you two boys to fight each other.

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:29.225
The winner gets to drive home,
but the loser...

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:31.684
they stay with me.

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:35.597
Just take the car, man. Just take the car.

01:21:36.726 --> 01:21:38.461
You got 10 seconds.

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:40.171
Ty, give him... give him the keys.

01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:43.090
- Six seconds.
- Give him the fucking keys, man!

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.843
- Four seconds.
- Ty, give him the fucking keys, man!

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:47.136
Two seconds.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.157
Dude, what are you doing? Ah!

01:21:57.038 --> 01:21:58.940
Ah! Fuck!

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.581
- Shit!
- Fuck.

01:22:11.886 --> 01:22:16.707
"My baby, don't go"

01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:22.228
"I never meant to feel that way"

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:30.930
"My baby, don't go"

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:37.201
"To be so haunted by a touch"

01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:45.695
"My baby, don't go"

01:22:45.795 --> 01:22:51.546
"I'll play it back every day"

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:20.873
Hi, I'm Heather. What's your name?

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.359
That's okay.
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:28.279
I just have one question for you.

01:23:28.379 --> 01:23:32.880
If you died today, do you know
100% that you would go to heaven?

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.912
Because there is actually only one way

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:38.539
where you can be sure
100% that you'll go to heaven.

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:41.180
- Did you know that?
- I don't wanna go to heaven.

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:47.405
I want to go to hell.

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:09.505
"You decide"

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:15.686
"Don't tell them what you know"

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:26.999
"They have their ways"

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:34.591
"Of making you tell them"

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:37.758
"Whoo"

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:43.935
"He messed up"

01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:52.187
"Forsaking our love"

01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:55.941
"Whoo"

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:02.165
"It's your life"

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:10.287
"And it's your love"
