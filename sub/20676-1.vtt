01:37:15.913 --> 01:37:18.081
[Fanny]
Hey!

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:21.000
Wait! No!
[Yells]

01:37:23.587 --> 01:37:25.380
Ha-haa!

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:30.802
[Fanny]
Hi!

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:39.519
Your star trout's
got a lot of muscle.

01:37:39.603 --> 01:37:44.566
Don't let her
get you in the water.
Eleanor's a great kid.

01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:48.528
[Scoffs]
You oughta
get to know her.

01:37:48.612 --> 01:37:52.156
Maybe we should have her
for dinner... amandine.

01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:57.954
I just made a joke.

01:37:59.164 --> 01:38:02.542
You didn't think
it was funny?
No, kidding.

01:38:02.626 --> 01:38:06.754
You got a great show...
with an ace attraction.

01:38:06.839 --> 01:38:09.007
Ace.

01:38:09.091 --> 01:38:12.594
You shouldn't kid
a kidder, Fanny.
What?

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.223
You performed
for me tonight.

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:20.226
I performed for you?
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:24.856
Well, I know you.

01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:28.818
I know how you think.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:33.197
You figure you want something,
the best way to go about
gettin' it is be funny.

01:38:33.282 --> 01:38:35.408
I've seen you
do that before.

01:38:35.492 --> 01:38:37.535
Oh, yeah?

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:43.249
Yeah. You went to
a lot of trouble
to make me laugh tonight.

01:38:43.334 --> 01:38:46.544
You've got a very
primitive sense of humor.
Know what I mean?

01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:51.799
Pratfalls, dropped drawers,
drowning bits.

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:57.805
You know, I got a‒
I got a terrific idea.

01:38:57.890 --> 01:39:01.434
I mean, I don't know
if it would work,
but see what you think.

01:39:01.518 --> 01:39:05.063
What's on your mind, kid?

01:39:05.147 --> 01:39:08.775
Why don't we get married?

01:39:08.859 --> 01:39:14.030
[Laughs]
We got married.

01:39:16.867 --> 01:39:21.871
Well, I mean, uh,
really be married.
Really married.

01:39:23.707 --> 01:39:29.212
Mrs. Rose is the name.
Chicken soup is the game.
Is that what you want?

01:39:44.895 --> 01:39:47.897
What I want is‒

01:39:50.275 --> 01:39:55.989
I want you to do more...
of what you did tonight.

01:39:56.073 --> 01:40:00.743
Brush off a broad
if you think
she's getting too close.

01:40:03.414 --> 01:40:07.458
You remember a...
long time ago...

01:40:07.543 --> 01:40:10.753
you made me say
"I need you"?

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:13.172
Hmm?

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:18.219
Well, that's what I want.

01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:24.726
I want you to need me.
I mean, really need me.

01:40:32.776 --> 01:40:35.945
Need me.

01:40:42.411 --> 01:40:46.998
You got some
sexy ears, honey.

01:40:47.082 --> 01:40:50.418
I think I'll stick
diamonds in 'em.

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:55.381
Hmm?

01:41:10.689 --> 01:41:12.482
I need you.

01:41:14.526 --> 01:41:16.360
I need you.

01:41:18.947 --> 01:41:21.783
I need you.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:32.668
Life, Collier's, Esquire‒

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:38.591
Stage‒ what is this?
The Saturday Evening Post.
More?

01:41:38.675 --> 01:41:41.385
Sure. Now, you shouldn't
get bored and pick up
strange men.

01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:43.763
Are there any other kind?

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:50.603
Listen, Billy. Will you
call me every night? Reverse
the charges if you want.

01:41:50.687 --> 01:41:54.273
Don't be a chump.
I got a new system
for beating the phone company.

01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:58.111
First you place a call
in the city of your choice‒
All aboard.

01:41:58.195 --> 01:42:00.446
I'm a mess, huh?

01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:03.574
You're fine.
[Train Whistle Blows]

01:42:03.659 --> 01:42:08.496
[Man]
All aboard. Chicago,
Denver and Los Angeles!

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.252
I'm gonna get ya
a bigger ring.
[Laughs]

01:42:14.336 --> 01:42:17.922
All right.
So long, Billy.

01:42:18.006 --> 01:42:20.508
[Man]
All aboard!

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:25.805
Billy!
Huh?

01:42:25.889 --> 01:42:28.808
Don't go near the water.

01:42:32.729 --> 01:42:35.148
[Chattering]

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:38.401
[Fanny] Norma,
I canceled the Baby Snooks
rehearsal to come here?

01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:41.487
[Norma]
Come on, Fanny.

01:42:41.572 --> 01:42:44.866
What is this, a costume party?
I get paid for wearing costumes.

01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:46.868
Stop "quetching."
[Fanny]
Kvetching.

01:42:46.952 --> 01:42:49.495
Kvetching. Kvetching.
You're gonna
just love it.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.789
We got seats
right next to the field.
You're gonna love it.

01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:54.625
Heigh-ho, Silverstein, right?
[Norma Chuckles]
Right.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:57.295
Oh, Fanny.

01:42:58.589 --> 01:43:01.507
[Fanny]
So this is Beverly Hills.

01:43:03.051 --> 01:43:05.803
You can't catch up
with the goyim.

01:43:05.888 --> 01:43:08.222
Just when you think
you've learned it all‒
grape scissors‒

01:43:08.307 --> 01:43:10.558
they come at you
with shooting sticks
and "hukkas."

01:43:10.642 --> 01:43:13.769
Chukkas. Chukkas.
Chukkas?

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:16.230
[Applause]

01:43:16.315 --> 01:43:19.525
Oh, I wish
Billy was here.

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:21.611
Billy loves baloney.

01:43:43.675 --> 01:43:48.638
- [Man] Take it.
- When Norma promises you'll
be excited, you'll be excited.

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:54.977
Do you know Nick?
Nick?

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:58.731
Oh, Fanny, you don't think
I planned anything, do you?

01:43:58.815 --> 01:44:03.027
He just was here, and‒
Norma, thank God you never
had to learn to act.

01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:05.029
[Exhales Forcefully]

01:44:05.113 --> 01:44:08.157
What I want to know is,
does he know I'm here?

01:44:08.242 --> 01:44:11.661
Well, I'm absolutely certain
he'd want to.

01:44:16.166 --> 01:44:20.711
I'll see you kids later.
I'll send the car back.
Enjoy the game.

01:44:27.344 --> 01:44:30.930
Oh, come on.
Quit while you're ahead.
Your finale is great.

01:44:31.014 --> 01:44:34.475
Don't try to walk
on the water, kid.

01:44:34.559 --> 01:44:39.272
Why don't you come on out here?
I'll send you a ticket.
I'll send you a return ticket.

01:44:39.356 --> 01:44:42.191
You want a private car?
I'll give my body
to Huntington Hartford.

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:45.987
Come on. How about it?
What do you say?

01:44:50.867 --> 01:44:53.452
No, no. I'm okay.

01:44:53.537 --> 01:44:57.957
No. I really am.
I just miss you, kid,
that's all.

01:45:00.377 --> 01:45:04.213
Look, if I get too lonely,
I'll send for Fran, right?

01:45:05.841 --> 01:45:08.092
Yeah. Sure.

01:45:10.178 --> 01:45:14.515
No. Don't be silly.
Of course I understand.

01:45:16.393 --> 01:45:20.896
I'll talk
to you next week, huh?
Maybe sooner.

01:45:22.399 --> 01:45:24.358
Sure.

01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:28.487
Me too.

01:45:30.741 --> 01:45:34.577
So long, Billy.
I'll see ya.

How are ya, kid?

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:53.651
I'm not sure.
A little nervous, I think.

01:48:53.735 --> 01:48:56.862
Me too.
[Clears Throat]

01:48:56.947 --> 01:49:00.533
Like always.
[Sighs]

01:49:00.617 --> 01:49:04.620
You ever think about
directing movies? You
already got the wardrobe.

01:49:08.291 --> 01:49:12.628
- You look ravishing, old girl.
- You look ravishing too.

01:49:15.173 --> 01:49:18.092
What's the matter? You
didn't have time to change
out of your polo clothes?

01:49:18.176 --> 01:49:23.931
Yes, I had plenty of time.
I tried to decide what
I should wear.

01:49:24.015 --> 01:49:28.561
And I looked in the mirror
and saw how becoming
this outfit was.

01:49:28.645 --> 01:49:33.065
So I just took a shower
and put on more of the same. I
thought I might get by with it.

01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:36.819
You picked up a new trick‒
telling the truth.

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:56.422
What are you thinking?
[Sighs]

01:49:57.674 --> 01:49:59.633
I was just remembering...

01:50:02.846 --> 01:50:06.223
when I first
went out with you.

01:50:06.308 --> 01:50:09.518
I was still living
home with Mama.

01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:12.521
I used to sleep
in the same bed with her,

01:50:12.606 --> 01:50:16.859
and once,
in the middle of the night,

01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:19.862
I woke up kissing her.

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:22.865
And she woke up and said,
"This ain't Nick."

01:50:24.534 --> 01:50:27.911
That's what I was thinking.

01:50:33.501 --> 01:50:36.462
How is your mother?

01:50:36.546 --> 01:50:40.090
She sold the saloons. She
lives in Lakewood, New Jersey.

01:50:40.175 --> 01:50:42.718
She likes Billy.

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:45.554
Ah, yes. Mr. Rose.

01:50:48.725 --> 01:50:50.684
How is Mr. Rose?

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:54.897
He keeps busy.

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:58.150
How about you?
I mean, when you come down
off your horse?

01:50:58.234 --> 01:51:01.153
Well, when I
come down off my horse,
there's the yacht...

01:51:01.237 --> 01:51:04.490
and a 13th-century palazzo,

01:51:04.574 --> 01:51:08.869
which we're pulling apart
stone by stone and rebuilding
in Cap d'Antibes.

01:51:08.953 --> 01:51:13.666
- The problems of dismantling
are just staggering.
- But I've always liked...

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:17.252
- dismantling
much better than "mantling."
- [Chuckles]

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:20.798
- Still the same old Fanny.
- You expecting Mrs. Roosevelt?

01:51:20.882 --> 01:51:25.803
I was expecting Fanny.
Hoping for Fanny.

01:51:29.599 --> 01:51:35.145
You know, Fanny,
the only trouble we had
was money.

01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:38.273
That's not a problem now.

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:41.276
No problem for you,
or no problem for your wife?

01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:45.197
No problem for either of us.

01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:48.367
If I walk away, I walk away
with a very large stake.

01:51:56.835 --> 01:51:59.795
How you fixed
for toothbrushes, kid?

01:52:03.842 --> 01:52:05.801
Oh, God.

01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:12.599
I remember that first time
in Baltimore,

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:18.856
when I went up
to your hotel room.

01:52:20.984 --> 01:52:24.027
And I went
into your bathroom.

01:52:27.741 --> 01:52:30.951
Jesus. You
had seven toothbrushes.

01:52:32.787 --> 01:52:36.582
Seven. I guess one
for every day in the week.

01:52:36.666 --> 01:52:41.336
And you had
this big wooden bowl
with soap in it.

01:52:42.756 --> 01:52:48.051
"By appointment
to His Majesty,"
it says on the bowl.

01:52:48.136 --> 01:52:51.305
Phew. Royal soap.

01:52:51.389 --> 01:52:55.350
And hanging on the door
were these silk pajamas,

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:59.730
red, with a monogram,

01:52:59.814 --> 01:53:02.983
real tiny, tiny.

01:53:04.194 --> 01:53:06.403
That small.

01:53:09.699 --> 01:53:13.202
Class. Phew.

01:53:15.163 --> 01:53:18.874
Boy, did I come out
of that bathroom
with personality. I mean‒

01:53:21.377 --> 01:53:23.545
I was all over the place.

01:53:27.091 --> 01:53:30.761
Because I fell in love
with those toothbrushes.

01:53:50.573 --> 01:53:53.700
I still have
seven toothbrushes, Fanny.

01:54:36.119 --> 01:54:39.079
And all these years...

01:54:41.249 --> 01:54:44.209
I've been in love
with nothing but a set...

I'll give you whatever
you want.

02:12:04.625 --> 02:12:07.752
I make a good living, kid.
I don't need the money.

02:12:07.836 --> 02:12:11.756
Well, maybe not,
but you need me.

02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:14.759
You?
You I've had.

02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:21.182
If you gotta get personal
it's gonna be a little south
of complimentary,

02:12:21.266 --> 02:12:24.185
but professionally,
I only helped you.

02:12:24.269 --> 02:12:27.855
In the work department,
I was good for you,
a good lift.

02:12:29.524 --> 02:12:33.110
Come on. Let's
get together again, huh?

02:12:35.697 --> 02:12:39.492
You know something?
My timing was always off
for us.

02:12:39.576 --> 02:12:42.787
It's too bad, really.
I just...

02:12:42.871 --> 02:12:45.581
loused it all up.

02:12:45.666 --> 02:12:49.043
Don't get such a swelled head.
I mean, you don't
get all the credit.

02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:55.299
What do you say? "Billy Rose
presents Fanny Brice."
I don't like the billing.

02:12:55.384 --> 02:12:57.593
All right. I'll‒
I'll think it over
and I'll call you.

02:12:57.678 --> 02:13:01.722
You'll think it over?
That's what you're sayin'?
"I'll think it over"?

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:05.059
Billy, I haven't
done anything without
thinking in over ten years.

02:13:07.145 --> 02:13:12.566
You wanna know the truth?
I was rattled as hell,
you comin' here tonight.

02:13:15.904 --> 02:13:19.407
I think what I wanted was
for you to come in here
beggin' me to come back...

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:23.744
so I could
have the pleasure
of sayin' no.

02:13:23.829 --> 02:13:27.164
It's taken me a long time
to learn how to say no.

02:13:27.249 --> 02:13:30.793
I wanted a chance to practice.
That's what you're
sayin' to me, no?

02:13:30.877 --> 02:13:35.548
To me you're saying no?
No. I'm saying I'll
think it over and call you.

02:13:35.632 --> 02:13:38.843
Think fast.
I don't wanna think fast.
That's the whole point.

02:13:38.927 --> 02:13:41.679
No, the point is
I'm at the Beverly Hills
till noon, day after tomorrow.

02:13:41.763 --> 02:13:43.931
So yes or no,
no or yes, yes or no?

02:13:44.016 --> 02:13:47.685
So I'll call you before noon
day after tomorrow, yes or no,
no or yes, yes or no.

02:13:50.439 --> 02:13:52.648
[Laughing]

02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:56.610
[Both Laughing]

02:14:05.078 --> 02:14:08.956
Make it yes.
Rose and Brice.
Brice and Rose.

02:14:09.041 --> 02:14:11.917
Rose and Brice.
Whatever.

02:14:12.002 --> 02:14:16.380
We could
have a terrific time.

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:31.604
