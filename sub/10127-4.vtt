OH, WE HAD
A WONDERFUL EVENING.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.367
YOU'RE REALLY
DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE,

19:40.367 --> 19:42.300
BUT WE REALLY SHOULD
BE HEADING BACK
TO THE AIRPORT.

19:42.300 --> 19:46.700
OH, NONSENSE.
COME ON,
ONE MORE STORY.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.767
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
WE GET TO MEET

19:48.767 --> 19:50.500
A COUPLE CELEBRITIES
FROM THE TV, HUH?

19:51.934 --> 19:56.767
OK, HA HA.
ONE MORE STORY.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.200
WHEN CORY WAS 7,

20:02.200 --> 20:03.700
HE FELL OFF
OF HIS BICYCLE.

20:03.700 --> 20:04.934
THE TOOTH FAIRY
STORY.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.500
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
WITH THE TEETH.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.900
WE ALREADY HEARD
THIS ONE.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.000
WHEN?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
6 HOURS AGO.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.934
FOR THE LOVE OF
GOD, LET US GO!

20:14.934 --> 20:17.233
NO, YOU SIT.
MY SON PAID YOU.

20:17.233 --> 20:21.200
YOU SIT AND YOU LISTEN
TO MY WIFE'S STORIES.

20:22.600 --> 20:26.500
BERNIE, I'M SCARED.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.767
<i>LOVE BOAT </i>STALKERS.

20:32.934 --> 20:36.133
HOW'D YOU LIKE
TO LIVE HERE?

20:36.133 --> 20:38.600
ANYWAY, CORY LOOKED
UNDER HIS PILLOW.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.133
BUT THAT'S
NOT THE STORY.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.800
THIS IS THE STORY.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.600
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]
