00:46.780 --> 00:47.947
Yeah-- Say, Doc.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.217
Don't... you... never... give... up?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.853
I'll never give up.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.955
Not until I know what it feels like

00:56.056 --> 00:58.058
to finally catch you.

00:58.124 --> 01:01.461
To experience the feeling of victory.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.630
If only just once, to know

01:03.730 --> 01:06.232
the feeling of catching a rabbit.

01:09.636 --> 01:10.537
[glass breaking]

01:15.875 --> 01:18.778
Listen, Mac. We could do this all day long.

01:18.878 --> 01:20.547
Or... you could know

01:20.613 --> 01:23.650
what it feels like to catch a rabbit

01:23.750 --> 01:25.051
right now.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.887
I'm listening.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.256
Dig this. We're living in the future, kid.

01:30.323 --> 01:33.660
What does the future have to do with catching rabbits?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.161
Let me explain.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.831
Nowadays, you don't even have to do anything

01:37.931 --> 01:39.766
to know what it's like to do it.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.801
What's that supposed to mean?

01:41.901 --> 01:43.670
Here, let me show you.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.006
[clattering]

Ta-da!

[triumphant music playing]

01:53.947 --> 01:55.515
What the heck is that?

01:55.615 --> 01:58.518
It's a virtual reality helmet.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.420
Virtual reality?

02:00.487 --> 02:02.021
Yeah! Since you'll never catch me

02:02.122 --> 02:05.091
in physical reality, you can use this

02:05.158 --> 02:07.127
to catch me in virtual reality.

02:07.193 --> 02:10.196
In VR, you can do anything you want!

02:10.296 --> 02:12.132
But I can't see anything.

02:12.198 --> 02:14.033
Oh. I'll turn it on.

02:15.268 --> 02:18.271
Ooh! It feels so high-tech.

02:18.338 --> 02:22.308
Oh, it is. Let me activate the simulation function.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.817
[surreal instrumental music playing]

02:30.884 --> 02:34.220
[Elmer] Holy moly! It looks so real!

02:34.320 --> 02:37.857
Golly! I just can't believe the detail.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.528
Everything is so vivid.

02:41.628 --> 02:42.795
This flower...

02:42.862 --> 02:45.331
[sniffing] It smells so flowery.

02:45.398 --> 02:46.666
And this stick...

02:46.733 --> 02:48.635
feels so sticky.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.170
And if you think that's great

02:50.236 --> 02:53.139
wait till you get a load of this virtual bomb.

02:53.206 --> 02:56.075
Wow, it looks so dangerous.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.012
But it's not. Because it's "virtual."

02:59.078 --> 03:00.847
You know, if this was reality

03:00.914 --> 03:02.982
I would be freaking out right now.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.218
But because this is a virtual bomb

03:05.318 --> 03:07.854
I have nothing to be afrai--

03:07.921 --> 03:13.226
Oh, the simulated pain is absolutely remarkable.

03:14.928 --> 03:18.598
[giggling] Gosh! That was such a good setup.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.900
Too bad it's over so quick.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.537
Boy, this VR is the best.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.606
I finally caught a rabbit.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.609
Now I can virtually cook and eat you.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.413
Oh, boy.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.849
I bet you're gonna taste virtually delicious.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.117
Wait a second, Doc.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.119
Why settle for a tiny, little rabbit

03:40.220 --> 03:43.856
like me when you can eat an even bigger rabbit?

03:43.923 --> 03:46.359
-Bigger rabbit? -Yeah.

03:46.426 --> 03:50.063
Like that massive, virtual rabbit over there.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.464
Huh?

[dramatic music playing]

03:56.536 --> 03:58.471
Holy smokes!

03:58.571 --> 04:01.407
It's the biggest rabbit I've ever seen.

04:01.474 --> 04:02.909
And it's mine.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.277
All mine.

04:04.377 --> 04:07.280
All right, rabbit. You're coming with me.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.819
[Elmer] I'm talking to you.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.721
Oh, you think you're tough, huh?

04:14.787 --> 04:16.222
Well, guess what, buddy?

04:16.289 --> 04:18.925
This is virtual reality

04:18.992 --> 04:21.160

[roars loudly]

04:33.172 --> 04:34.607
Wow.

04:34.674 --> 04:38.077
Rabbits in virtual reality are scary, ferocious beasts.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.113
But I have nothing to worry about, because--

-[Elmer screaming] -[bear roaring]

04:47.820 --> 04:52.191
I think I'm ready to go back to normal reality now.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.993
Are you kiddin'?

04:54.093 --> 04:56.296
You've been trying to catch me for years.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.865
Persistent guys like you don't just give up.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.535
And besides, you're just getting your virtual feet wet.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.038
Now tell me, and be honest.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.439
Is there anything in real life

05:06.506 --> 05:08.808
you've been unable to confront?

05:08.875 --> 05:10.977
Something you've been afraid of?

05:11.044 --> 05:16.015
Well, my biggest fears are heights and my mother.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.052
Great! We'll confront them in virtual reality

05:19.152 --> 05:20.486
right now!

05:24.691 --> 05:26.626
Oh... Uh-uh...

05:26.693 --> 05:29.295
Remember, Doc. It's not real.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.798
[Elmer's mother]  Elmer! Is that you?

05:32.665 --> 05:34.734
Yeah, Mom. It is me.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.569
-[Elmer's mother shouting] -What?

05:36.669 --> 05:40.573
No, you listen! Rabbit hunting is a real job.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.574
And another thing.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.909
From now on, I'm picking out

05:43.009 --> 05:44.844
my own clothes when you take me shopping.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.746
-[Elmer's mother shouting] -Oh, yeah?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.748
Fine! Cut me out of your will.

But guess what? I'm done eating my vegetables.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.754
It's ice cream sandwiches from now on.

05:54.854 --> 05:55.988
Got it?

05:56.055 --> 05:59.158
Wow! Fantastic job, bud.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.326
I'm proud of you.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.662
You conquered both your fears!

06:02.729 --> 06:05.598
But I didn't overcome my fear of heights.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.333
Could have fooled me, Doc.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.403
You're really taking to sky-diving.

06:15.341 --> 06:16.943
So, what do you say, Doc?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.612
Do you prefer hunting in virtual reality

06:19.712 --> 06:21.381
or physical reality?

06:22.715 --> 06:24.884
Uh, neither.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.186
I prefer metaphysical reality.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.767
Do you have a permit for transporting giraffes?

07:16.903 --> 07:20.239
No, but I do have a permit for transporting lions.
