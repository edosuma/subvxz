00:37.376 --> 00:39.991
<i>Several decades ago</i>

01:46.717 --> 01:50.202
I will never forget my grudge,

01:50.359 --> 01:51.721
Netero!

01:52.737 --> 01:54.159
Jed...

01:54.346 --> 01:56.922
Why won't we put an end to this already?

01:57.360 --> 01:59.216
<i>Hyakki Juon...</i>

01:59.851 --> 02:01.049
<i>Rasetsu!</i>

02:08.360 --> 02:09.911
Even if I die,

02:10.161 --> 02:11.991
<i>On</i> will live on!

02:14.055 --> 02:15.522
"<i>On</i>", you say?

02:15.749 --> 02:19.216
I shall put you to eternal rest
together with <i>On</i>.

02:20.008 --> 02:22.058
With the power of my <i>Nen</i>.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.848
<i>100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva!</i>

02:32.547 --> 02:34.784
<i>Ninety-Ninth Hand!</i>

02:52.700 --> 02:56.011
<i>Present</i>

03:57.173 --> 03:59.360
How could this happen..!

04:00.067 --> 04:01.452
Who are they?!

04:04.827 --> 04:07.877
We need to contact the
Hunters Association..!

04:11.126 --> 04:12.202
Help..!

04:17.144 --> 04:19.208
The time has come.

04:19.308 --> 04:22.091
The time for revenge.

04:22.192 --> 04:25.743
You who hold a grudge against the Hunters.

04:25.843 --> 04:29.169
Your anger, hatred, and grudge -

04:29.572 --> 04:32.789
towards those who locked you up here...

04:33.872 --> 04:35.559
Release...

04:36.703 --> 04:38.521
all of it.

04:42.129 --> 04:45.227
Shadow is going to rule over light.

05:03.506 --> 05:04.312
Here you go!

05:04.853 --> 05:05.485
I'll take one!

05:05.685 --> 05:06.819
Thank you!

05:49.069 --> 05:49.721
Sorry!

06:16.900 --> 06:17.670
Here you go!

06:17.976 --> 06:19.458
Thank you!

06:22.331 --> 06:23.373
Bye bye!

06:24.885 --> 06:28.285
It feels like it's been ages
since we've been in a city!

06:28.385 --> 06:31.445
Since we've been in a jungle until now.

06:32.707 --> 06:36.119
There were so many strange lifeforms there!

06:38.596 --> 06:42.689
A city seems to have a lot of those
as well, though.

06:45.161 --> 06:47.551
<i>Hey there, lady!</i>

06:47.651 --> 06:53.959
Isn't it rude to bump into someone
and act like nothing happened?

06:54.817 --> 06:57.186
Please stop blaming her...

06:57.286 --> 07:00.419
<i>Her skirt barely touched you...</i>

07:00.519 --> 07:02.146
Whatcha saying?!

07:02.363 --> 07:07.135
You got some nerve to oppose me!

07:07.235 --> 07:09.314
<i>If words alone aren't enough...</i>

07:09.414 --> 07:12.660
I guess I gotta let my fist talk!

07:18.756 --> 07:19.830
You bastard..!

07:27.953 --> 07:29.251
<i>Osu!</i>

07:30.341 --> 07:32.453
Thank you very much!

07:32.553 --> 07:35.454
I don't know how to thank you enough...

07:35.554 --> 07:36.878
Please, take this...

07:36.978 --> 07:38.375
Out of question!

07:38.475 --> 07:40.515
I just did the obvious.

07:40.587 --> 07:41.970
Excuse me.

07:46.488 --> 07:47.585
<i>Zushi!</i>

07:49.543 --> 07:51.187
Gon-san! Killua-san!

07:51.387 --> 07:53.080
Long time, no see!

07:53.180 --> 07:54.280
Long time, no see'<i>ssu</i>!

07:54.387 --> 07:55.060
'<i>Ssu</i>!

07:55.676 --> 07:58.059
<i>Hello, Gon-kun, Killua-kun!</i>

07:58.468 --> 07:59.630
You seem well.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.062
Wing-san! Biske!

08:02.162 --> 08:03.218
"Biske"?

08:03.318 --> 08:05.139
Wing gets a "<i>-san</i>",

08:05.239 --> 08:06.988
while I'm "Biske"?!

08:07.088 --> 08:08.060
No honorific?!

08:08.160 --> 08:09.892
Well, but...

08:09.992 --> 08:12.632
Didn't you tell us to call you "Biske"?

08:13.850 --> 08:16.325
You seem the same as always, Gon-kun!

08:16.425 --> 08:18.140
Same goes for you!

08:18.240 --> 08:20.065
As sloppy as always!

08:20.504 --> 08:21.713
Well...!

08:23.244 --> 08:24.975
<i>Tuck your shirt in!</i>

08:25.291 --> 08:27.120
It feels nostalgic...

08:29.915 --> 08:31.448
Yeah.

08:31.499 --> 08:33.714
It's nostalgic.

08:39.025 --> 08:40.895
The Heaven's Arena!

08:43.707 --> 08:45.989
<i>To all the combat sports fans
around the world,</i>

08:46.089 --> 08:47.796
<i>thank you for waiting!</i>

08:47.896 --> 08:50.376
The festival of the world's
strongest fighters,

08:50.476 --> 08:55.021
the Battle Olympia's curtains finally open
here at the Heaven's Arena!

08:55.121 --> 08:59.589
Naturally, all the matches are
broadcasted live all around the world -

08:59.789 --> 09:03.505
via television, radio and the Internet!

09:03.605 --> 09:07.296
<i>Only the lucky people with
limited edition tickets -</i>

09:07.396 --> 09:08.830
<i>are packed here in the assembly hall!</i>

09:08.930 --> 09:10.687
<i>Ah, how enviable!</i>

09:11.349 --> 09:14.376
<i>And amongst them, several
celebrities are present -</i>

09:14.476 --> 09:20.100
<i>to view the world's strongest fighters
with their own eyes!</i>

09:24.533 --> 09:27.650
How unfortunate, it truly is unfortunate.

09:28.275 --> 09:31.639
It's come to my knowledge
that your father has fallen ill.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.202
I, Garcia, truly wished to meet him.

09:34.302 --> 09:36.810
Unfortunate, unfortunate...
- That's too bad.

09:38.657 --> 09:39.703
Pardon for having bothered you.

09:42.725 --> 09:44.099
Here, here!
- <i>As you know,</i>

09:44.224 --> 09:47.170
<i>the higher you get on the Heaven's Arena,</i>

09:47.270 --> 09:49.259
<i>the more influencial you're acknowledged as,</i>

09:49.359 --> 09:53.901
<i>and this Battle Olympia is
a tournament of the Floor Masters -</i>

09:54.001 --> 09:56.367
<i>of floors 230 through 250!</i>

09:56.428 --> 09:57.701
I see.

09:57.801 --> 09:59.884
So you didn't get to meet Ging yet.

09:59.984 --> 10:02.553
No, but I met Kaito instead.

10:02.653 --> 10:05.762
I was happy to get
to introduce Killua, too!

10:06.085 --> 10:07.409
That's great!

10:07.509 --> 10:11.229
We'll meet up again once
the Battle Olympia is over.

10:11.329 --> 10:13.580
<i>And now, the participants enter the stage!</i>

10:14.334 --> 10:15.562
Here they come.

10:16.260 --> 10:17.672
<i>Here are all the participants!</i>

10:19.215 --> 10:20.586
Zushi is so amazing!

10:20.765 --> 10:23.180
He even became a Floor Master!

10:23.280 --> 10:26.957
He never missed a day of training.

10:28.064 --> 10:29.985
They're really intense...

10:30.085 --> 10:32.767
That guy is Zushi's opponent?

10:32.867 --> 10:35.540
"Has crushed an innumerable
amount of wrestlers,

10:35.640 --> 10:37.676
as well as referees"?

10:37.776 --> 10:40.077
It'll be fine! Zushi...

10:40.374 --> 10:41.590
... is strong!

10:42.443 --> 10:45.423
I can't wait to see
how much stronger he's gotten.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.222
<i>Thank you for inviting us, Wing-san!</i>

10:49.322 --> 10:50.996
You're welcome.

10:51.196 --> 10:54.026
I have invited one more surprise person.

10:55.055 --> 10:58.409
I thought I'd ask for Zushi's
medical trainer to come.

10:59.627 --> 11:01.069
I ended up being late...

11:01.169 --> 11:03.409
When is Zushi's match gonna be?

11:03.509 --> 11:05.801
Apparently Gon and Killua are here too...

11:07.196 --> 11:09.973
I wanna show them my <i>Nen</i> already!

11:20.781 --> 11:21.793
Ouch!

11:21.893 --> 11:24.852
Man, that's dangerous!
They should shut these properly.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.671
What're you gonna do
if a kid trips over one?

11:54.412 --> 11:55.825
What should we do with him?

11:56.268 --> 11:58.115
We can't kill him.

11:58.215 --> 11:59.100
Roger.

12:00.931 --> 12:04.726
There's no way someone as
foolish looking as this is a Hunter.

12:09.516 --> 12:10.939
<i>Here they are!</i>

12:11.039 --> 12:15.625
<i>One of these 21 participants will become
the strongest Floor Master!</i>

12:20.279 --> 12:23.911
<i>A man of legend has come to
witness this historical day!</i>

12:24.111 --> 12:27.216
<i>The chairman of the Hunters
Association, Netero!</i>

12:27.926 --> 12:29.236
It's Netero-san!

12:29.336 --> 12:31.079
The old man is here too?

12:32.653 --> 12:38.080
<i>Dear Floor Masters participating
in the Battle Olympia...</i>

12:38.223 --> 12:40.070
<i>I am Netero,</i>

12:40.094 --> 12:42.726
<i>the chairman of the Hunters Association.</i>
- Oh, he didn't skip out!

12:43.474 --> 12:46.221
I didn't expect <i>him</i> to
give a serious speech.

12:46.321 --> 12:48.365
It's a formal occasion, after all.

12:49.459 --> 12:57.149
<i>... but winning a fight and reaching
the top is also the beginning of isolation.</i>

12:57.349 --> 12:59.583
<i>When the result of a fight is out...</i>

13:00.589 --> 13:02.133
Excuse me for a second.

13:02.367 --> 13:03.713
Got it.

13:06.297 --> 13:11.268
<i>... and what you see in front of you
is nothing but peace and tranquility.</i>

13:11.368 --> 13:14.477
<i>When you find yourself in such a situation,</i>

13:14.569 --> 13:19.352
<i>you'll wonder what you
pursued that strength for.</i>

13:19.458 --> 13:23.204
<i>Did the things you did
so far have any meaning?</i>

13:23.853 --> 13:28.789
<i>You may even have lost sight of everything.</i>

13:32.551 --> 13:35.244
<i>Anyway, just have fun.</i>

13:39.345 --> 13:40.089
Is it over?

13:40.302 --> 13:42.307
That's our chairman alright!

13:42.500 --> 13:43.595
Right?

13:43.875 --> 13:46.897
<i>Did you hear the chairman's words?</i>

13:46.997 --> 13:48.741
<i>Did they reach you?</i>

13:48.941 --> 13:54.449
<i>He told you to have fun and
enjoy this very moment!</i>

13:56.124 --> 14:01.352
<i>And now, please enjoy the dance show
by the official Battle Olympia mascots!</i>

14:01.452 --> 14:03.135
<i>It's a showtime!</i>

14:09.882 --> 14:14.272
<i>To celebrate our participants,
the fairies have arrived tonight.</i>

14:14.372 --> 14:17.190
<i>The passionate flame hidden
behind those glass eyes...</i>

14:17.290 --> 14:18.080
Gon.

14:18.180 --> 14:20.180
Let's use this opportunity to
go see the old man.

14:20.280 --> 14:20.971
Okay!

14:23.779 --> 14:25.694
"Have fun"... huh?

14:30.916 --> 14:34.164
You're strong, Rengoku.

14:38.855 --> 14:40.665
Let's reunite in Nirvana.

14:43.628 --> 14:44.586
Go.

14:48.136 --> 14:50.361
Shall we have some fun, then?

14:57.484 --> 14:58.379
<i>Chairman!</i>

14:58.479 --> 15:01.551
<i>What did you end the greeting early for?!</i>

15:01.651 --> 15:04.309
<i>Don't tell me you didn't
take a proper look beforehand -</i>

15:04.640 --> 15:06.559
<i>This is the elevator doorman.</i>

15:06.659 --> 15:08.895
<i>Er, there are kids here saying
they want to meet you -</i>

15:08.995 --> 15:11.012
<i>- It's fine! Come on!
- Hey, stop that!</i>

15:11.119 --> 15:12.368
<i>- Stop right there!
- Let us pass!</i>

15:13.983 --> 15:15.814
You can let them through!

15:16.396 --> 15:19.180
It's been ages since we've
seen the old man.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.918
I wonder if we can steal
the ball from him by now?

15:31.877 --> 15:34.072
You've gotten good!

15:35.460 --> 15:36.368
Here!

15:38.172 --> 15:40.596
Shall we have some tea in my room?

15:45.642 --> 15:47.473
I can't breathe...

15:48.441 --> 15:50.029
Do your best!

15:50.482 --> 15:51.897
Hey, Kurapika!

15:51.997 --> 15:53.452
Huh? Kurapika?

15:54.926 --> 15:56.453
Welcome~

15:56.670 --> 15:57.810
What do you want?

15:57.910 --> 16:01.142
This year's participants are such
poor quality, it's a disappointment.

16:01.242 --> 16:02.449
I'm bored.

16:02.549 --> 16:04.830
I'm not here to relieve your boredom.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.575
That's cold. What do you think?

16:07.675 --> 16:10.093
We could build a card house together...

16:10.778 --> 16:12.786
If that's all, I shall take my leave.

16:12.886 --> 16:14.858
Does your presence mean...

16:14.958 --> 16:16.256
Gon and the others are here, too?

16:16.356 --> 16:19.180
I don't know. I haven't been contacted.

16:19.280 --> 16:22.042
I always act on my own.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.392
You picking a fight?

16:35.927 --> 16:37.853
Can't we get started already?

16:37.953 --> 16:39.603
I'm itching to fight!

16:39.754 --> 16:42.036
That's you itching?

16:51.072 --> 16:53.516
<i>We will begin the first match.</i>

16:54.918 --> 17:01.242
<i>Just how much sweat have the participants
shed before stepping on this stage?</i>

17:06.236 --> 17:07.838
<i>Osu!</i>

17:08.339 --> 17:10.230
What the heck are you?

17:11.015 --> 17:12.862
Ya hear me, bastard?!

17:24.153 --> 17:26.077
I'm done.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.367
No problems here, either.

17:33.904 --> 17:36.484
<i>Machine Eater!</i>

17:53.254 --> 17:56.202
It's a system that uses
a generator in the tower -

17:56.331 --> 17:59.868
as the electric supply for all the floors.

18:01.041 --> 18:05.595
Shut off the surveillance of the elevators.
I'll take care of the controls.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.555
Complete.

18:09.779 --> 18:11.671
It was seriously bad!

18:11.771 --> 18:13.490
Who would do that just because of
an idea they got?

18:13.590 --> 18:16.365
You used the Risky Dice tons of
times yourself, too!

18:16.465 --> 18:18.927
It's fine for me!
- Is that so.

18:21.570 --> 18:23.070
Netero-san?

18:23.170 --> 18:24.704
What is it, old man?

18:45.363 --> 18:49.537
<i>The first match: Zushi versus Candiru!</i>

18:54.100 --> 18:58.004
<i>Combat ranks: Super Heavy rank
and Mosquito rank!</i>

18:58.104 --> 19:01.846
<i>Zushi is facing a tough battle
right off the bat!</i>

19:01.946 --> 19:03.523
<i>Candiru's...</i>

19:03.678 --> 19:05.108
<i>Whoops?!</i>

19:05.982 --> 19:08.752
<i>What does this mean?</i>

19:10.222 --> 19:11.917
<i>This is not Candiru!</i>

19:12.017 --> 19:16.086
<i>Who on Earth appeared from
under the mantle?!</i>

19:16.854 --> 19:20.303
This is the Heaven's Arena?

19:20.503 --> 19:22.443
Not bad.

19:30.762 --> 19:32.444
Come on, did you die on me?!

19:50.746 --> 19:52.541
What an eyesore.

19:58.068 --> 19:58.983
<i>What is this?!</i>

19:59.936 --> 20:02.348
Report: There's gas!

20:36.184 --> 20:38.294
Is something wrong, Netero-san?

20:46.456 --> 20:48.224
<i>This aura...</i>

20:49.083 --> 20:50.364
Fifty-nine.

20:51.002 --> 20:52.317
Fifty-eight.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.295
Fifty-seven.

20:56.385 --> 20:59.062
<i>No, that person is already...</i>

21:01.143 --> 21:01.965
Fifty-three.

21:02.065 --> 21:04.281
<i>By my own hand...</i>

21:05.086 --> 21:06.232
Fifty-one.

21:07.234 --> 21:08.072
Fifty.

21:14.508 --> 21:15.659
You..!

21:19.977 --> 21:21.493
<i>Onbasara!</i>

21:35.464 --> 21:36.608
Netero-san!

21:44.613 --> 21:45.862
My, my.

21:45.962 --> 21:48.806
To get so distracted by reminiscing.

21:49.713 --> 21:52.723
I wonder if I'm losing my edge.

21:52.923 --> 21:53.839
We gotta help!

21:53.939 --> 21:55.374
Don't touch it!

21:56.690 --> 21:58.860
What the hell is this?!

21:59.990 --> 22:02.969
The contract and restriction with <i>On</i>.

22:05.310 --> 22:06.343
What's the meaning of this?

22:15.665 --> 22:16.528
What, what?!

22:18.180 --> 22:20.057
Kurapika won't pick up...

22:21.381 --> 22:23.281
We were too slow.

22:25.660 --> 22:29.071
S-stop right there!
I have nothing to do with this!

22:29.171 --> 22:31.016
<i>Hey, what's happening?!</i>

22:31.116 --> 22:33.162
<i>What did you do to the Floor Master?!</i>

22:34.479 --> 22:36.262
Maybe that was too soon.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.327
Do you think this is unfair?

22:40.427 --> 22:41.228
No.

22:41.328 --> 22:43.605
Feel free to use weapons or anything else.

22:43.705 --> 22:46.465
No matter how unexpected...

22:46.565 --> 22:48.696
a real martial artist
never runs from a fight!

22:51.812 --> 22:58.903
By taking her own life,
this person sealed my <i>Nen</i> abilities.

22:59.003 --> 23:02.536
Does that mean you can't use your Nen?!

23:02.636 --> 23:04.067
What should we do...

23:04.286 --> 23:09.393
You shouldn't get involved in this.
One wrong move and we're all dead.

23:09.774 --> 23:10.792
Why...

23:11.566 --> 23:14.642
Why didn't we notice her approaching us?

23:14.742 --> 23:15.529
That's right!

23:15.664 --> 23:18.407
Even if she used <i>Zetsu</i>, we should
have noticed her with <i>En</i>!

23:19.542 --> 23:24.476
If you hide your presence with <i>On</i>,
<i>En</i> becomes useless.

23:24.576 --> 23:26.160
What is this "<i>On</i>"?!

23:27.191 --> 23:32.933
<i>On</i> is a power different from <i>Nen</i>
that feeds off of deep hatred.

23:33.033 --> 23:37.028
It was supposed to have been locked away
in darkness a long ago...

23:37.128 --> 23:39.393
along with that man.

23:50.364 --> 23:52.732
So you're finally showing yourself?

24:13.557 --> 24:18.021
That's your limit? How weak.

24:18.121 --> 24:19.303
But...

24:20.684 --> 24:21.890
An elbow strike?

24:21.990 --> 24:24.250
I did enjoy myself a little.

24:24.807 --> 24:27.607
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. Look at this.</i>

24:33.848 --> 24:35.266
Zushi!

24:35.954 --> 24:37.886
That's the guy who beat him?

24:37.986 --> 24:40.792
How dare he do that to Zushi..
I won't forgive him!

24:41.403 --> 24:44.295
You won't forgive, huh...

24:56.020 --> 24:57.263
This is bad!

25:23.405 --> 25:24.895
Is that Gon?

25:28.126 --> 25:29.620
It's not here either.

25:30.050 --> 25:35.951
The security control room...
should be on the 230th floor.

25:37.346 --> 25:39.653
They sure went all out.

25:41.331 --> 25:45.975
Someone broke a wall on the 50th floor.
Capture them immediately.

25:49.808 --> 25:55.749
Did the old hatred cause you to be
reborn with a different appearance?

25:57.828 --> 25:59.213
You are...

26:00.205 --> 26:01.714
Jed's...

26:07.455 --> 26:09.655
<i>Can you see it?
My dear Hunters.</i>

26:12.769 --> 26:17.858
<i>Don't move. All hostages' lives
are tied to Netero's.</i>

26:22.080 --> 26:24.766
I wonder if the boys are alright.

26:25.104 --> 26:27.793
No need to worry about those two.

26:28.909 --> 26:29.987
But...

26:32.197 --> 26:34.704
How could that happen to Netero...

26:36.981 --> 26:38.378
<i>These people...</i>

26:39.559 --> 26:41.708
<i>What on Earth are they?</i>

26:47.093 --> 26:48.994
Ouch...

26:53.861 --> 26:55.965
This is the 50th floor.

26:56.447 --> 26:58.516
It seems there's nobody here.

26:58.616 --> 27:01.804
Is it blocked during the Battle Olympia?

27:03.230 --> 27:04.607
Say, Gon...

27:10.873 --> 27:15.202
I wonder what that "<i>On</i>" is.
What are those people?

27:15.922 --> 27:17.197
I won't forgive them.

27:19.656 --> 27:23.510
For doing that to Zushi and Netero-san,
I won't forgive them!

27:24.608 --> 27:25.727
Yeah.

27:27.431 --> 27:28.835
<i>What's going on?!</i>

27:29.219 --> 27:30.363
This is Sugino reporting.

27:30.463 --> 27:33.831
More and more of the government troops'
armored vehicles are assembling at the scene.

27:33.931 --> 27:36.099
The amount is immense.

27:36.199 --> 27:39.640
What could be happening at
the Heaven's Arena?

27:45.378 --> 27:46.884
We're in the middle of investigating now,
- Yes. This is...

27:46.984 --> 27:48.064
- so we can't answer.

27:48.164 --> 27:51.619
Yes, but we can't answer that inquiery...

27:52.674 --> 27:53.649
What in the world.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.384
Nothing makes sense.

28:01.657 --> 28:04.857
Geez...
Why can't you just lend a hand...

28:04.963 --> 28:06.603
We were contacted by the mastermind!

28:07.466 --> 28:08.944
It's finally here...

28:09.719 --> 28:10.664
I'm putting him on.

28:14.607 --> 28:18.768
<i>Long time no see, ladies and gentlemen
of the Hunters Association.</i>

28:19.141 --> 28:21.551
We are... the Shadow.

28:21.651 --> 28:25.585
We have captured Netero and taken
control over the Heaven's Arena.

28:26.228 --> 28:27.532
At dawn...

28:27.664 --> 28:30.094
we're going to execute Netero
together with the hostages.

28:30.194 --> 28:31.512
<i>"Shadow"?</i>

28:31.112 --> 28:32.553
<i>I've never heard of it.</i>

28:32.653 --> 28:33.362
<i>Me neither.</i>

28:33.562 --> 28:34.882
<i>The Shadow.</i>

28:34.982 --> 28:37.985
<i>It used to be an operational
underworld unit.</i>

28:39.022 --> 28:42.877
<i>They carried out missions that needed
to be hidden from the public.</i>

28:43.077 --> 28:44.081
<i>However...</i>

28:44.181 --> 28:48.342
<i>to radically reduce its activity,
chairman Netero eradicated it,</i>

28:48.442 --> 28:50.737
<i>and sealed not only all
documents from the time,</i>

28:50.837 --> 28:53.524
<i>but also its very existence.</i>

28:54.647 --> 28:56.795
<i>The Shadow should be long gone already.</i>

28:58.323 --> 29:00.083
What is your requirement?

29:01.072 --> 29:03.445
<i>An official announcement...</i>

29:03.645 --> 29:06.125
<i>of the Black Record that
the Association is hiding.</i>

29:11.116 --> 29:14.228
Who on Earth are you?

29:15.753 --> 29:20.174
<i>You have time to do the announcement
until 5 o'clock. That's in ten hours.</i>

29:20.274 --> 29:22.871
<i>I will stay here until then.</i>

29:24.598 --> 29:26.699
<i>Together with Netero.</i>

29:34.563 --> 29:35.408
Yes?

29:35.508 --> 29:37.811
- Yes.
- Isn't that the private line...

29:38.611 --> 29:40.247
- Yes. Yes.
- ...for high executives?

29:40.429 --> 29:42.414
- This is the first time I've seen it ring.
- That's...

29:42.614 --> 29:45.043
Yes, understood.

29:53.278 --> 29:56.124
Excuse me for leaving at
the time of emergency,

29:56.224 --> 29:58.384
but something came up that
I must attend.

30:04.007 --> 30:05.898
You're really a handful...

30:19.977 --> 30:21.612
What are these guys?

30:24.370 --> 30:25.667
Seriously?

30:25.767 --> 30:28.116
Looks like we have no choice but to fight.

30:34.194 --> 30:35.974
We are aware.

30:36.174 --> 30:42.006
Of the hidden history of darkness of
the Hunters Association, smeared in blood.

30:42.106 --> 30:44.994
Hey, let me go!
What is this?!

30:48.913 --> 30:50.753
H-help me!

30:50.853 --> 30:53.020
I'll give you all the money you want!

30:56.121 --> 30:57.946
Go ahead and beg for help.

30:58.494 --> 31:01.337
From the chairman of
the Hunters Association, that is.

31:10.709 --> 31:11.674
I see.

31:11.774 --> 31:17.990
She has the ability to attack anything
that comes in touch with me in this state.

31:18.766 --> 31:23.225
She's dead, yet I'm still controlled
and moved around by her <i>On</i>.

31:23.325 --> 31:25.962
What a pitiful thing.

31:28.241 --> 31:30.057
That brand is...

31:30.157 --> 31:32.072
the Kanan concentration camp's..!

31:33.542 --> 31:34.593
That's right.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.896
She's a descendant of the Shadow.

31:37.096 --> 31:41.100
She got sent to a concentration camp
by the Hunters Association.

31:41.692 --> 31:45.707
There shouldn't be anybody
knowing about it anymore.

31:46.093 --> 31:49.320
I... gave out the instructions...

31:49.420 --> 31:52.592
to process it all behind closed doors...

31:52.692 --> 31:55.345
by Hunters who have that ability...

31:57.484 --> 32:00.219
That only covers a fragment of
what happened.

32:00.319 --> 32:06.808
There were countless countries that
ordered to make the Shadow a top secret.

32:07.405 --> 32:12.162
The evidence is stored in
the Black Record.

32:13.071 --> 32:16.101
Are you planning to reveal that
to the whole world?

32:23.469 --> 32:25.462
<i>What the hell does this mean?!</i>

32:25.562 --> 32:29.049
<i>Wasn't the Black Record
sealed away completely?</i>

32:29.997 --> 32:33.755
The mastermind knew about its existence.

32:33.855 --> 32:39.042
Perhaps he's some sort of descendant of
Jed who was the leader of the Shadow.

32:39.142 --> 32:41.126
<i>We need to find out who he is
or we're in trouble.</i>

32:41.128 --> 32:44.544
<i>If the Black Record is announced,
it'll affect national interest!</i>

32:44.644 --> 32:47.068
<i>It'll affect our entire nation!
- There's a possibility -</i>

32:47.168 --> 32:48.945
<i>for a new world war to break out!</i>

32:49.045 --> 32:51.435
<i>What the hell is
the Association doing?!</i>

32:52.006 --> 32:53.685
<i>Hey, what are you going to
do about this?!</i>

32:54.632 --> 32:55.751
Excuse me.

32:56.642 --> 32:57.742
Yes?

32:59.340 --> 33:00.430
I see.

33:01.968 --> 33:02.963
Yes.

33:04.472 --> 33:05.810
Understood.

33:07.687 --> 33:11.319
There is no data about
the man behind this.

33:11.419 --> 33:16.240
There's no information about Jed
having any blood relatives.

33:16.340 --> 33:17.935
<i>If that's the case...</i>

33:18.540 --> 33:22.001
<i>If that's the case,
who the hell is he?</i>

33:26.415 --> 33:28.021
Those were a pain in the ass!

33:28.121 --> 33:29.727
We're finally at the 200th floor.

33:30.507 --> 33:32.121
Just a bit more.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.341
Seems like they're gone.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.565
Yeah.

33:51.176 --> 33:52.775
This place is...

33:53.281 --> 33:57.658
Using weapons is allowed from
the 200th floor onwards.

33:57.758 --> 34:01.150
You never know when the weapon
you're holding will break.

34:03.872 --> 34:05.521
It seems to be self-locked.

34:05.631 --> 34:07.887
If all goes well, this'll open it-

34:10.414 --> 34:11.289
Alright!

34:11.389 --> 34:14.953
That's so like you...

34:17.601 --> 34:19.780
There's so much stuff in here!

34:20.272 --> 34:22.882
Killua! I found something good!

34:25.536 --> 34:27.159
Ta-da!

34:27.260 --> 34:29.360
Why would they be selling that?!

34:30.670 --> 34:34.449
Maybe it's because I used one
in a match before?

34:43.946 --> 34:46.013
Yep, feels good!

34:48.219 --> 34:49.889
That's so nostalgic!

34:52.795 --> 34:55.292
Who are these people?

34:55.891 --> 34:59.119
Seems like they're all trying to get here.

35:00.064 --> 35:04.970
However... you won't be able to
reach this place.

35:24.361 --> 35:25.769
Gas?

35:35.051 --> 35:38.789
It feels like we're being lead on.

35:42.877 --> 35:44.485
We're locked in!

35:46.316 --> 35:48.189
Gon, it's poison gas!

35:48.938 --> 35:50.734
I'm fine with this much, but...

35:50.834 --> 35:52.439
<i>I can win!</i>

35:53.739 --> 35:55.120
<i>I can win...</i>

35:55.220 --> 35:56.480
<i>I can win!</i>

35:56.580 --> 35:58.655
<i>I can win, I can win!</i>

35:59.192 --> 36:00.682
Is he saying something?

36:01.095 --> 36:03.643
I feel it... I feel it..!

36:09.730 --> 36:10.758
They're fast!

36:13.337 --> 36:14.438
You dodged...

36:14.538 --> 36:16.954
You dodged my attack..!

36:17.955 --> 36:19.559
I can't win..?

36:19.759 --> 36:22.040
I can't win!

36:24.066 --> 36:25.186
What's his problem?!

36:25.286 --> 36:26.262
Isn't this..!

36:26.445 --> 36:29.877
I'm going to be the strongest Floor Master!

36:40.765 --> 36:42.570
What are these people?!

36:53.983 --> 36:56.883
There's some people fighting, you say?

37:00.606 --> 37:01.508
Hey.

37:01.608 --> 37:07.498
I remember once seeing the martial arts
you used on this kid.

37:08.831 --> 37:10.579
Are you perhaps...

37:10.679 --> 37:12.878
a descendant of the Shadow?

37:16.694 --> 37:18.355
That's right.

37:19.525 --> 37:24.261
How surprising that a young girl like you
knows about the Shadow's existence.

37:24.361 --> 37:26.051
She isn't as young as she -

37:28.222 --> 37:30.087
The descendants of the Shadow...

37:30.346 --> 37:34.397
Didn't you hide in a village
built deep in the mountains?

37:36.121 --> 37:37.301
Indeed.

37:37.401 --> 37:41.030
We lead a peaceful life there.

37:41.130 --> 37:46.046
But the nation... Garcia didn't
accept our existence,

37:46.146 --> 37:50.543
he roused us into rebellion
through absolute persecution,

37:50.643 --> 37:55.758
and under the name of justice, executed
a plan to annihilate the suppressed Shadow.

37:56.784 --> 37:59.265
He set us up completely...

38:00.037 --> 38:01.105
And under the law,

38:01.205 --> 38:07.785
he used Hunters to toss us
into a concentration camp.

38:09.437 --> 38:13.461
Countless of my comrades were
forced to work like slaves,

38:13.561 --> 38:18.861
and they died a miserable death
in poor living conditions.

38:20.614 --> 38:23.251
We are carrying out a revenge...

38:24.601 --> 38:30.901
with this power of <i>On</i> that person
awakened in us.

38:41.809 --> 38:46.522
Seems like the Association hasn't
settled things yet.

38:49.711 --> 38:50.881
No...

38:51.671 --> 38:53.386
Seems like I was wrong.

39:00.823 --> 39:02.610
Damn, we got caught!

39:15.043 --> 39:16.766
What is this aura?

39:16.866 --> 39:18.157
This is "<i>On</i>"!

39:33.812 --> 39:35.408
<i>Hyakki Juon...</i>

39:38.271 --> 39:40.135
<i>Rasetsu!</i>

40:08.093 --> 40:10.489
Wh... What is that monster..!

40:23.162 --> 40:24.437
I knew it..!

40:28.396 --> 40:30.807
It's true after all.

40:30.907 --> 40:35.362
I thought you were an incarnation
of his old grudge, but...

40:36.497 --> 40:39.550
Your hatred that remained in
this world was so deep

40:39.650 --> 40:41.165
you were unable to ascend to heaven,

40:41.265 --> 40:43.658
and the hatred that had no place to go to,

40:43.758 --> 40:48.740
revived not only your soul but
your body as well.

40:49.888 --> 40:55.034
I never imagined I'd meet you
again in such a form.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.089
Jed!

41:09.002 --> 41:11.191
Something seems to be happening.

41:31.024 --> 41:35.681
Seems like something dropped down. There's
a thick smoke, I can't see a thing.

41:36.394 --> 41:37.244
Who are you?!

41:38.300 --> 41:39.396
<i>Is it the terrorists?!</i>

41:55.332 --> 41:57.667
<i>Dancing Doll!</i>

42:01.934 --> 42:05.055
What on Earth is happening here?

42:12.003 --> 42:13.904
That was refreshing.

42:17.314 --> 42:20.315
Er... What are you people trying to do?

42:21.643 --> 42:22.966
I'm done, Shura.

42:24.555 --> 42:28.450
Good job.
But you over-did it a little.

42:28.550 --> 42:32.431
These small fries barely count
as a warming up.

42:33.824 --> 42:37.001
<i>So, what's up with those guys
you mentioned?</i>

42:37.101 --> 42:39.904
They seem rather belligerent.

42:47.409 --> 42:51.601
Hey hey, show me too. Hey!

42:51.701 --> 42:54.688
<i>You're hopeless.</i>

42:54.788 --> 42:55.845
<i>I'll put them on.</i>

43:03.496 --> 43:06.061
These guys are damn persistent!

43:06.161 --> 43:09.321
I'm strong... I'm strong...

43:09.353 --> 43:13.437
Oh, geez! What's the hell's
wrong with this guy?!

43:13.893 --> 43:15.336
Can I kill him?

43:15.436 --> 43:16.464
No!

43:16.710 --> 43:18.963
That person is Zushi's battle opponent!

43:19.542 --> 43:20.820
Then what am I supposed to do?!

43:20.920 --> 43:23.571
<i>Go easy on him! But make him
unable to fight anymore!</i>

43:23.813 --> 43:25.098
Huh?!

43:25.198 --> 43:26.554
What a pain in the ass!

43:26.654 --> 43:29.996
<i>Shouldn't that be easy for you?
- Don't be stupid!</i>

43:30.196 --> 43:32.327
<i>You don't know before you try!</i>

43:33.782 --> 43:35.473
What is it, Gaki?

43:35.947 --> 43:36.952
<i>Shura!</i>

43:37.385 --> 43:40.034
Let me fight those two!

43:40.134 --> 43:41.720
<i>Do I have to?</i>

43:43.927 --> 43:46.875
Yeah. You have to!

44:02.249 --> 44:03.852
Don't go at them seriously!

44:04.095 --> 44:06.858
But at this rate, they're gonna get us!

44:13.020 --> 44:15.226
It stayed shut until now...

44:15.326 --> 44:17.921
This is obviously a trap.

44:22.229 --> 44:23.385
Just what we needed!

44:23.485 --> 44:24.760
That's more like it!

44:29.034 --> 44:30.368
I'm strong...

44:30.468 --> 44:32.034
I'm strong..!

44:32.134 --> 44:33.537
I'm strong..?

44:45.684 --> 44:49.886
The vain existence of people engulfed by <i>On</i>.

44:49.986 --> 44:55.046
You sold your soul to the devil.

44:55.146 --> 44:58.155
<i>Just keep running your mouth,
dog of that filthy association!</i>

44:58.255 --> 45:00.516
<i>Number four of the ten Hunter Commandments:</i>

45:00.616 --> 45:04.736
<i>"Hunters shall not target other Hunters".</i>

45:04.836 --> 45:05.911
Yo!

45:06.191 --> 45:09.854
<i>Yet you massacred my comrades
in front of my eyes.</i>

45:09.979 --> 45:11.294
Who are you?

45:12.319 --> 45:15.085
I won't let you go further!

45:16.234 --> 45:20.585
Let's have a Battle Olympia
ring-side battle!

45:21.230 --> 45:22.579
An Emitter, aren't you?

45:22.679 --> 45:25.372
<i>There is a condition to that law:</i>

45:25.435 --> 45:33.940
<i>"Unless they commit heinous crimes",
that is.</i>

45:34.040 --> 45:36.039
<i>That's nothing but the Association's chicanery!</i>

45:36.239 --> 45:37.520
You're good...

45:37.821 --> 45:39.390
You're good..!

45:39.490 --> 45:42.666
This is how it's gotta be!

45:42.766 --> 45:45.754
<i>After joining the Shadow and seeing
numerous Hells on this Earth,</i>

45:45.854 --> 45:46.815
<i>I was convinced.</i>

45:46.915 --> 45:48.487
<i>Hunters are evil!</i>

45:48.587 --> 45:52.818
<i>They flatter you by calling you a great man
to satisfy your desires.</i>

45:53.018 --> 45:56.862
On <i> is the power of revenge
of the oppressed!</i>

45:56.962 --> 45:58.201
Finally...

45:58.301 --> 45:59.712
we meet.

46:03.809 --> 46:04.781
Whoops!

46:14.023 --> 46:17.301
You're on a whole different level than
those guys we've fought so far!

46:17.401 --> 46:17.921
Yeah!

46:27.415 --> 46:29.096
Not that I have any intention
to lose to you.

46:32.603 --> 46:36.593
We're gonna hurry to the top and
save Netero-san and the others!

46:39.404 --> 46:42.901
You two are pretty interesting!

46:47.669 --> 46:48.849
I guess.

46:51.703 --> 46:52.677
Tell me.

46:54.567 --> 46:56.637
Why are you doing this?

47:08.215 --> 47:10.901
There's no way for you to understand.

47:12.451 --> 47:14.913
The depth of our grudge.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.683
<i>Don't kill him.</i>

47:31.808 --> 47:34.733
<i>We were ordered to take them alive.</i>

47:52.156 --> 47:53.285
<i>They noticed us!</i>

47:56.584 --> 47:58.675
<i>Hey! Some brats are escaping!</i>

48:18.833 --> 48:24.081
<i>You brats may have the ability to do that...</i>

48:24.181 --> 48:26.014
<i>To bring Jed back to this world.</i>

48:30.784 --> 48:31.610
<i>O wind!</i>

48:31.710 --> 48:33.995
<i>Listen to us, desert smeared in blood!</i>

48:34.095 --> 48:37.968
<i>We hate this world!
We reproach it!</i>

48:38.068 --> 48:40.641
<i>We want power!</i>

48:40.741 --> 48:43.495
<i>Show yourself to us!</i>

49:27.836 --> 49:31.587
<i>I swear lifelong loyalty to your highness</i>

49:31.687 --> 49:34.492
<i>and to take revenge on all Hunters.</i>

49:34.692 --> 49:36.012
<i>I swear.</i>

49:36.112 --> 49:37.406
<i>I swear.</i>

49:43.893 --> 49:47.274
<i>I have accepted your grudge loud and clear.</i>

49:47.774 --> 49:49.831
<i>I'll grant you power.</i>

49:53.846 --> 49:55.746
<i>Death to the Hunters.</i>

49:59.231 --> 50:04.122
We made a contract with <i>On</i>
to complete our revenge.

50:05.266 --> 50:08.716
I'd never lose to Hunters!

50:14.709 --> 50:16.017
Is that so!

50:16.458 --> 50:20.303
I don't give a crap, but your attacks
have been pretty monotonic here!

50:20.978 --> 50:22.352
So have yours!

50:22.452 --> 50:23.987
Don't group us together!

50:29.627 --> 50:30.436
Damn!

50:36.548 --> 50:37.354
Gon!

50:59.875 --> 51:00.910
Hey!

51:01.010 --> 51:03.075
<i>Where are you aiming?!</i>

51:24.395 --> 51:26.360
You're pretty good!

52:07.732 --> 52:09.396
That was close...

52:18.163 --> 52:18.773
Gon!

52:18.873 --> 52:20.284
<i>Above you!</i>

52:25.622 --> 52:28.324
You can do it if you try, can't you?!

52:28.424 --> 52:30.282
<i>Did he control that?</i>

52:30.382 --> 52:32.729
<i>Is he a Transmuter instead of an Emitter?</i>

52:46.166 --> 52:49.766
<i>The fact that he could take
a punch like that...</i>

52:49.866 --> 52:52.096
<i>he can become an Enhancer, too?!</i>

52:55.545 --> 52:57.543
I don't get it at all!

53:00.666 --> 53:04.946
<i>Why's the elevator's wire not here?</i>

53:11.544 --> 53:16.777
Seems like you can keep on managing
the security system while fighting.

53:18.910 --> 53:24.289
You're a Manipulator who can operate
the Heaven's Arena's system at will.

53:24.389 --> 53:27.637
In other words, to reset it while
it's under your control,

53:27.737 --> 53:31.483
I have no choice but to take your life.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.279
You're wrong assuming that
your shallow <i>Nen</i> -

53:35.379 --> 53:39.389
works the same way as the profound
power of my <i>On</i>.

53:39.489 --> 53:42.199
This is the first time I hear about "<i>On</i>",

53:42.399 --> 53:45.026
but I have come to realise one
fact while fighting you.

53:45.126 --> 53:46.158
Oh?

53:46.355 --> 53:48.406
That form of martial arts...

53:48.606 --> 53:51.134
You're a descendant of the Shadow,
aren't you?

53:52.206 --> 53:56.950
I know about the Shadow's fate.
It's a tragical story.

53:57.150 --> 54:00.483
Is it the reason you're causing this riot?

54:04.657 --> 54:06.721
I don't need your pity!

54:16.509 --> 54:19.080
<i>Shape Shifter.</i>

54:31.547 --> 54:33.251
I see, you are...

54:33.351 --> 54:35.007
from the Kurta clan, aren't you?

54:35.107 --> 54:40.515
<i>Shape Shifter</i> not only formulates the body,
it also analyses the target person.

54:57.079 --> 55:00.445
<i>This strength... Enhancement?</i>

55:00.793 --> 55:02.987
You're not a Manipulator?

55:03.087 --> 55:04.364
Didn't I tell you?

55:04.703 --> 55:07.752
<i>On</i> is not the same as <i>Nen</i>.

55:08.558 --> 55:12.670
Aura types don't exist in the world of <i>On</i>.

55:14.600 --> 55:20.923
For those who serve <i>On</i>, it's possible
to draw out all the types.

55:21.817 --> 55:23.715
I see.

55:23.815 --> 55:26.480
So that's the case.

55:32.981 --> 55:34.509
<i>Holy Chain</i>.

55:45.467 --> 55:46.786
Oh?

56:00.446 --> 56:02.561
The wind feels nice...

56:04.727 --> 56:05.918
What?

56:14.705 --> 56:16.084
Hi~

56:16.184 --> 56:17.495
Hisoka!

56:18.845 --> 56:20.662
Hey, let me go!

56:21.100 --> 56:22.613
Are you sure?

56:28.127 --> 56:30.056
No, stop! Don't let go!

56:30.156 --> 56:33.359
It was so noisy inside that
I came out here, but...

56:33.459 --> 56:36.594
you're even noisier.
- What the hell!

56:36.694 --> 56:38.903
What do you want from me?!

56:40.260 --> 56:43.308
Three cards are stronger than one pair...

56:43.408 --> 56:47.487
but four cards are stronger than three.

56:47.687 --> 56:50.111
So what are you talking about?

56:50.211 --> 56:54.994
When you have all the cards,
the game gets tenfolds more fun.

56:57.832 --> 56:59.687
Shall we go?
- What?

57:06.868 --> 57:08.994
I'm done playing games with you!

57:09.094 --> 57:14.578
<i>What a waste. This place is so
dark, confined and empty.</i>

57:14.678 --> 57:20.778
<i>I'd have wanted to finish him off in the
spotlights, in front of a cheering audience.</i>

57:24.088 --> 57:25.083
What?!

57:31.849 --> 57:32.700
Killua!

57:34.044 --> 57:38.414
Whoa, Gon! It looked like
you were actually struggling!

57:39.659 --> 57:40.927
A little.

57:41.327 --> 57:43.524
How did you move it?

57:43.624 --> 57:45.157
This elevator...

57:45.257 --> 57:46.914
seems to have a linear motor.

57:47.014 --> 57:49.068
It moves with electromagnetism.

57:53.138 --> 57:53.992
Gon!

57:54.429 --> 57:55.397
Shit!

57:57.367 --> 57:58.654
Whoa!

58:00.433 --> 58:02.262
<i>He's still up there.</i>

58:11.261 --> 58:13.527
<i>We're even at hand-to-hand combat...</i>

58:18.645 --> 58:21.503
<i>but when it comes to speed, I win!</i>

58:42.531 --> 58:43.921
See ya.

58:45.173 --> 58:48.454
<i>Impossible!
Why can't I move?</i>

58:48.554 --> 58:52.002
<i>First comes rock..!</i>

58:52.890 --> 58:53.736
<i>Rock!</i>

58:54.190 --> 58:55.455
<i>Paper!</i>

58:56.424 --> 58:58.184
<i>When did he..!</i>

58:58.208 --> 59:02.844
<i>Rock!</i>

59:18.723 --> 59:22.148
Those children have really grown, too.

59:26.565 --> 59:27.911
We did it!

59:28.011 --> 59:28.936
Yeah!

59:29.414 --> 59:31.770
Wh... why..?

59:31.870 --> 59:33.816
How..?

59:33.916 --> 59:36.846
How did you stop me from moving?

59:36.946 --> 59:38.542
That linear elevator -

59:38.642 --> 59:42.177
uses a mechanism of electromagnets
on the rails on the walls,

59:42.277 --> 59:46.313
and a permanent magnet on
the cab to move. So...

59:46.413 --> 59:50.304
All I did was move the permanent magnet.

59:52.527 --> 59:54.684
Welding it was a piece of cake.

59:54.784 --> 59:57.265
Shit... When did you have the time to..?

59:57.365 --> 01:00:00.247
While you were all caught
up just fighting Gon.

01:00:00.447 --> 01:00:05.177
It feels more like a battle to
fight one to one.

01:00:07.056 --> 01:00:10.665
Are you Battle Olympia participants?

01:00:10.765 --> 01:00:11.598
Huh?

01:00:24.469 --> 01:00:27.901
No. Our friend is participating.

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:29.762
His name is Zushi.

01:00:32.409 --> 01:00:37.281
He's that chestnut head guy that
you beat the shit out of.

01:00:39.924 --> 01:00:41.304
Is that so.

01:00:43.283 --> 01:00:48.143
He packed a pretty good punch...
though he still needs to grow.

01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:51.578
If he trains hard, that
guy's gonna be strong.

01:00:57.829 --> 01:01:01.300
Well, you're not half bad at
combat yourself, geezer.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.117
Yeah! You should have participated in
the Battle Olympia instead of doing this!

01:01:06.217 --> 01:01:08.680
You could have faired pretty well.

01:01:33.508 --> 01:01:34.606
What's wrong?!

01:01:37.225 --> 01:01:39.053
Get away from me...

01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:42.091
This is the restriction set for my <i>On</i>!

01:01:43.579 --> 01:01:44.793
But..!

01:01:48.794 --> 01:01:50.116
Gon!

01:02:10.786 --> 01:02:14.687
His restriction was to self-destruct
if he loses to a Hunter...

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:22.745
Why?

01:02:22.845 --> 01:02:24.283
How come?!

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:27.931
Hey. I don't understand.

01:02:28.031 --> 01:02:30.986
Letting their friend make
such a restriction...

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.136
He was their friend..!

01:02:39.805 --> 01:02:41.367
So why..!

01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:47.115
I won't forgive them!

01:02:47.215 --> 01:02:50.471
The power of <i>On</i> that makes them
do things like this to get strong...

01:02:50.571 --> 01:02:52.202
It's wrong!

01:03:07.816 --> 01:03:08.852
Hear me, Gaki!

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.239
My brother whom I gave my blood to!

01:03:11.339 --> 01:03:13.805
I won't let your death be in vain.

01:03:13.905 --> 01:03:16.033
I won't let it!

01:03:19.765 --> 01:03:21.398
It disappeared.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:29.715
Did you go ahead, Gaki?

01:03:30.696 --> 01:03:34.684
I have finally been left all alone.

01:03:46.854 --> 01:03:49.062
Why do you fight?

01:03:49.162 --> 01:03:54.412
As the survivor of the Kurta clan
and an avenger just like me,

01:03:54.512 --> 01:03:56.950
isn't your anger the source of your life?

01:03:57.803 --> 01:04:02.857
The anger and hatred towards those
who took your brethren's lives -

01:04:02.957 --> 01:04:06.846
is right there in your scarlet eyes.

01:04:06.946 --> 01:04:09.046
You're the same as us!

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:10.455
Wrong!

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:14.683
Killing you would be a waste.

01:04:17.725 --> 01:04:19.844
Wouldn't you join us?

01:04:21.366 --> 01:04:25.877
And become a fellow <i>On</i> user.

01:04:29.003 --> 01:04:30.401
I refuse.

01:04:30.869 --> 01:04:32.831
Is that so?

01:04:36.137 --> 01:04:37.668
In that case...

01:04:38.655 --> 01:04:39.889
Die!

01:04:44.662 --> 01:04:46.664
Kurapika!

01:04:47.424 --> 01:04:48.484
Hey!

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.819
Get a hold of yourself!

01:04:51.398 --> 01:04:54.226
What the hell is that?

01:04:54.326 --> 01:04:54.940
It's <i>On</i>.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.301
"<i>On</i>"?

01:04:56.499 --> 01:04:57.803
He is..

01:04:57.903 --> 01:05:01.003
possessed by wanting revenge
on his comrades.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.514
Revenge...

01:05:04.614 --> 01:05:06.448
That's right.

01:05:07.382 --> 01:05:09.618
Just like me.

01:05:21.256 --> 01:05:22.936
<i>Cut that crap...</i>

01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:28.327
Don't say such bullshit! You're
not the same at all!

01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:30.080
Listen.

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:33.472
If it seems like you're about to
lose yourself to your grudge...

01:05:33.572 --> 01:05:34.646
you have me,

01:05:34.746 --> 01:05:35.525
and Gon,

01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:36.665
and Killua -

01:05:36.888 --> 01:05:41.447
to punch you right on the face
and snap you out of it!

01:05:43.787 --> 01:05:46.762
Can you hear me?! Get
a hold of yourself!

01:05:48.052 --> 01:05:52.163
If you're already losing yourself,
I'll do it right now..!

01:05:55.507 --> 01:05:59.472
I'd never fall low enough to
need to be punched by you.

01:06:02.765 --> 01:06:03.973
I have...

01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:06.562
gained new comrades.

01:06:07.548 --> 01:06:11.078
I will fight for those comrades now.

01:06:16.842 --> 01:06:18.231
Oh?

01:06:18.331 --> 01:06:20.850
Looks like we can still play some more.

01:06:25.957 --> 01:06:26.997
<i>This is bad!</i>

01:06:33.015 --> 01:06:35.342
Is this all there is to your "<i>On</i>"?!

01:06:35.442 --> 01:06:36.982
<i>It hurts!</i>

01:06:37.082 --> 01:06:39.307
<i>This much damage despite
guarding myself with</i> Ten <i>,</i>

01:06:39.407 --> 01:06:41.512
<i>what the hell is that power?!</i>

01:07:20.786 --> 01:07:22.948
He was more fragile than I expected.

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:35.593
Master... Jed...

01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:59.296
What's this?

01:07:59.496 --> 01:08:02.956
Looks bad for one's body.

01:08:06.566 --> 01:08:09.027
You can't use <i>Nen</i> anymore.

01:08:09.127 --> 01:08:10.512
What did you say?!

01:08:11.042 --> 01:08:13.788
Wha... What did you do?

01:08:14.517 --> 01:08:18.684
Be honored. It's Master Jed's blood.

01:08:18.783 --> 01:08:23.279
You'll be able to awaken your <i>On</i> with it.

01:08:28.343 --> 01:08:29.809
Are you alright?!

01:08:31.002 --> 01:08:38.115
With <i>On</i>'s power, you can live
and fight for revenge only.

01:08:38.962 --> 01:08:40.596
I refuse!

01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:42.319
Kurapika!

01:08:44.951 --> 01:08:47.638
What I fight for is...

01:08:49.676 --> 01:08:53.002
Do as you please. However...

01:08:53.102 --> 01:08:55.805
if you don't do a contract with <i>On</i>...

01:08:55.906 --> 01:08:58.715
there's only death waiting for you.

01:09:00.879 --> 01:09:08.144
Master Jed! I have fulfilled
my loyalty to you.

01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:12.513
Now I only wish for...

01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:16.252
complete revenge through your hand!

01:09:19.514 --> 01:09:20.889
Kurapika!

01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:22.892
<i>Come on, get a hold of yourself!</i>

01:09:22.901 --> 01:09:25.977
<i>Kurapika!</i>
- What an unsatisfactory climax.

01:09:26.616 --> 01:09:29.765
I guess you get about 65 points.

01:09:48.901 --> 01:09:50.202
Shura.

01:09:50.502 --> 01:09:53.696
Your death... your grudge...

01:09:53.796 --> 01:09:56.710
will add to my strength.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.312
Let's dispel all the regret!

01:10:04.526 --> 01:10:07.726
You gave those people your blood -

01:10:07.826 --> 01:10:10.460
and made them captivated by <i>On</i>.

01:10:11.873 --> 01:10:13.348
That's right.

01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:17.146
They made a contract by acquiring my blood,

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:21.597
and gained the power of <i>On</i>
that surpasses <i>Nen</i>.

01:10:23.204 --> 01:10:27.288
Why didn't you use that blood on me, then?

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.594
To acquire power,

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:34.895
I set a certain condition.

01:10:35.874 --> 01:10:37.232
Netero.

01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:39.986
You're the only one my blood won't work on.

01:10:41.378 --> 01:10:44.456
So that I could use my abilities
at their maximum -

01:10:44.556 --> 01:10:47.813
once I meet you whom I resent
more than anybody else.

01:10:48.224 --> 01:10:50.610
It's the proof that along
with defeating you,

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:54.201
I was resolved to put you through danger.

01:10:54.301 --> 01:10:57.846
Have you completely lost yourself to <i>On</i> ?

01:10:58.768 --> 01:11:00.407
Say what you want.

01:11:01.055 --> 01:11:05.072
I will let you keep your
sanity until the end.

01:11:05.299 --> 01:11:10.130
I want you to witness with your own eyes...

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:13.340
the downfall of the Hunters Association
that you've created!

01:11:19.547 --> 01:11:21.103
Kurapika!

01:11:21.712 --> 01:11:22.980
Hi~

01:11:23.703 --> 01:11:24.512
Hisoka?

01:11:24.612 --> 01:11:25.532
What about me?!

01:11:25.655 --> 01:11:27.951
What happened to Kurapika?!

01:11:29.174 --> 01:11:32.658
Seems like he was struck with
the blood of this Jed person.

01:11:32.958 --> 01:11:37.512
It's not very clear, but seems like
he can't use <i>Nen</i> anymore.

01:11:37.612 --> 01:11:41.456
If he doesn't make a contract with
this power called "<i>On</i>" he's going to die.

01:11:41.556 --> 01:11:42.836
No way!

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.551
Don't worry.

01:11:46.388 --> 01:11:51.115
I'd rather die than make
a contract with <i>On</i>.

01:11:51.215 --> 01:11:53.461
You can't die, Kurapika!

01:11:53.561 --> 01:11:56.229
Then there's no choice but to
make the contract...

01:11:56.329 --> 01:11:57.737
He can't do that either!

01:12:00.531 --> 01:12:02.716
Kurapika, hang in there!

01:12:05.186 --> 01:12:07.701
Never mind me...

01:12:07.828 --> 01:12:09.641
You need to help everyone.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.611
I will save everyone.

01:12:13.176 --> 01:12:15.421
But I'll also save you!

01:12:15.521 --> 01:12:17.545
Because you're my friend!

01:12:20.217 --> 01:12:23.805
Seems like you have no choice but
to defeat that Jed person.

01:12:25.254 --> 01:12:27.194
You have all the right cards.

01:12:28.352 --> 01:12:32.462
But you don't have the means
to defeat the final opponent.

01:12:32.562 --> 01:12:38.791
Keep in mind that to win the game,
you need a trump card.

01:12:39.384 --> 01:12:40.787
What do you mean?

01:12:45.145 --> 01:12:48.014
No matter how strong the opponent is...

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.468
No matter what means I need to use...

01:12:51.506 --> 01:12:54.091
I'll definitely defeat Jed!

01:12:54.824 --> 01:12:58.051
Wait for me, Kurapika.
I'll definitely save you.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:00.574
Stay here to take care of
Kurapika, Leorio!

01:13:00.702 --> 01:13:01.545
Sure!

01:13:02.236 --> 01:13:03.366
Killua!

01:13:06.727 --> 01:13:07.910
Yeah.

01:13:08.296 --> 01:13:09.432
Let's go!

01:13:12.327 --> 01:13:15.310
I'm counting on you.

01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:16.744
Gon!

01:13:22.851 --> 01:13:24.973
<i>Kurapika's heartbeat...</i>

01:13:25.073 --> 01:13:26.318
<i>But...</i>

01:13:26.418 --> 01:13:29.627
<i>I can't leave Neon's side...</i>

01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:32.612
Hey, hey! Come look at this!

01:13:54.743 --> 01:13:59.225
Seems like we could prevent
any civils from getting hurt.

01:13:59.325 --> 01:14:02.940
Just when I thought I could
take things easy!

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.516
Now I'm worn out.

01:14:05.719 --> 01:14:08.444
The incident hasn't been solved yet.

01:14:09.296 --> 01:14:12.599
Well, those kids should fair just fine.

01:14:13.947 --> 01:14:15.109
Probably.

01:14:15.642 --> 01:14:19.906
Well then, we should start
evacuating the visitors.

01:14:20.006 --> 01:14:21.803
Ehh...

01:14:22.003 --> 01:14:24.340
Zushi, we're going!

01:14:24.906 --> 01:14:25.863
<i>Osu!</i>

01:14:30.898 --> 01:14:32.836
The impact is incredible.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:36.585
This place is definitely too dangerous.

01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:59.186
I'm going to kick your ass!

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:02.452
My friend's life is on the line!

01:15:03.664 --> 01:15:05.971
Oh? Your friend?

01:15:06.316 --> 01:15:08.229
But unfortunately...

01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:11.136
that friend of yours is a Hunter, right?

01:15:11.336 --> 01:15:15.084
I will make sure all <i>Nen</i> users will be gone
from this world without a trace,

01:15:15.184 --> 01:15:17.159
and <i>On</i> will prevail.

01:15:17.259 --> 01:15:19.728
I won't let you!

01:15:21.716 --> 01:15:22.942
I'm out of charge...

01:15:23.042 --> 01:15:24.376
<i>I'll go first!</i>

01:15:24.476 --> 01:15:25.308
<i>Rock!</i>

01:15:25.408 --> 01:15:26.909
<i>Paper!</i>

01:15:28.437 --> 01:15:29.989
<i>Paper!</i>

01:15:37.226 --> 01:15:38.041
Killua!

01:15:38.141 --> 01:15:39.088
I'm fine!

01:15:46.096 --> 01:15:46.296
<i>Rock!</i>

01:15:47.286 --> 01:15:48.689
<i>Paper!</i>
- Stop it!

01:15:49.782 --> 01:15:51.963
<i>Rock!</i>

01:15:56.136 --> 01:15:57.317
Gon!

01:16:02.135 --> 01:16:04.116
It won't even touch him.

01:16:04.216 --> 01:16:07.240
There's no way to beat him with
an Emission type attack.

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:09.758
But if you get his blood on you,
it's the end!

01:16:09.858 --> 01:16:11.680
<i>First comes rock!</i>

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.402
I told you to stop!

01:16:12.439 --> 01:16:13.184
<i>Rock!</i>

01:16:13.284 --> 01:16:14.010
<i>Paper!</i>

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:15.212
<i>Scissors!</i>

01:16:24.771 --> 01:16:25.541
<i>He's strong!</i>

01:16:25.641 --> 01:16:28.094
<i>How are we supposed to beat him?!</i>

01:16:28.456 --> 01:16:29.401
Gon!

01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:35.581
If I don't beat you,
Kurapika's going to die!

01:16:36.581 --> 01:16:40.720
Not necessarily. All he needs to do
is make a contract with <i>On</i>.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.715
I won't let that happen!

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:44.730
Then...

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:48.114
I'll make a contract with <i>On</i>
and defeat you!

01:16:49.594 --> 01:16:50.723
Oh?

01:16:51.067 --> 01:16:52.486
Don't be ridiculous!

01:16:53.126 --> 01:16:56.544
Jed, I'll be your opponent!
I'll fight you to death!

01:17:08.321 --> 01:17:10.015
Are you okay, Killua?

01:17:10.115 --> 01:17:10.814
Gon...

01:17:14.424 --> 01:17:16.112
That was a good strike.

01:17:17.548 --> 01:17:19.327
Idiot! Why?!

01:17:19.627 --> 01:17:22.582
I'm glad... You seem to be unharmed.

01:17:37.201 --> 01:17:38.268
Killua!

01:17:42.135 --> 01:17:43.234
<i>Rock..!</i>

01:17:46.132 --> 01:17:48.356
I can't use <i>Nen</i>...

01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:01.220
At this rate...

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.378
Killua...

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:03.950
Kurapika...

01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:06.222
and Netero-san, they will all die...

01:18:11.995 --> 01:18:15.654
<i>He's strong. Overwhelmingly strong.</i>

01:18:16.303 --> 01:18:17.257
<i>But!</i>

01:18:19.696 --> 01:18:21.106
<i>I have to beat him!</i>

01:18:23.888 --> 01:18:26.788
<i>He hurt my friends.</i>

01:18:26.988 --> 01:18:29.350
I will definitely...

01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:31.762
defeat you myself!

01:18:36.357 --> 01:18:38.047
If it comes down to this..!

01:18:39.452 --> 01:18:40.560
What?

01:18:44.724 --> 01:18:46.273
I'll use <i>On</i>!

01:18:47.375 --> 01:18:48.856
I'm making a contract!

01:18:48.956 --> 01:18:50.900
A contract and a restriction!

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:56.697
Don't do it... Gon...

01:18:57.752 --> 01:18:59.184
Stop it!

01:19:00.612 --> 01:19:04.156
I'll definitely protect my friends!

01:19:05.536 --> 01:19:08.549
Well done! Experience the same
physical superiority as I do.

01:19:11.421 --> 01:19:12.465
How does it feel?

01:19:12.565 --> 01:19:14.760
Having your body overflow with power.

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.755
<i>On</i> is your anger turned into strength.

01:19:27.079 --> 01:19:30.806
<i>He's strong... But that's
the power of </i> On <i>...</i>

01:19:30.906 --> 01:19:32.467
<i>At this rate, Gon will...</i>

01:19:34.263 --> 01:19:37.538
You have become one of us now.

01:19:37.638 --> 01:19:40.316
I'd never become one of you!

01:19:41.685 --> 01:19:42.724
<i>Rock!</i>

01:19:43.324 --> 01:19:44.558
<i>Paper!</i>

01:19:45.715 --> 01:19:46.969
<i>Rock!</i>

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:55.048
If you won't become my comrade,

01:19:55.148 --> 01:19:59.080
I will devour you and return
it all into my power.

01:19:59.517 --> 01:20:01.872
<i>Even with</i> On <i>, he still can't win?</i>

01:20:01.972 --> 01:20:04.988
<i>Is there nothing I can do?!</i>

01:20:09.607 --> 01:20:10.737
<i>"Listen, Killua."</i>

01:20:11.009 --> 01:20:14.458
<i>"You're the only one who can use </i> Nen <i>."</i>

01:20:15.716 --> 01:20:16.782
<i>Old man...</i>

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.709
You're going to die at this rate.

01:20:28.809 --> 01:20:32.264
You'd better make a further
contract with <i>On</i> now.

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:35.358
Turn your anger and grudge into strength.

01:20:36.109 --> 01:20:38.612
Should I try killing your friends?

01:20:40.119 --> 01:20:44.846
At any rate, we will massacre
all Hunters who won't join us.

01:20:48.764 --> 01:20:51.422
You can't kick the bucket
in a place like this!

01:20:51.522 --> 01:20:56.238
Gon and Killua are doing their best!
Don't you dare die on your friends!

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.177
Killua!

01:21:22.647 --> 01:21:26.527
Listen... I fought your friend.

01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:33.922
He was plenty strong even without using <i>On</i>.

01:21:36.427 --> 01:21:37.419
I...

01:21:37.519 --> 01:21:41.603
I don't want my friends to
gain strength through <i>On</i>!

01:21:43.085 --> 01:21:44.244
Please...

01:21:44.444 --> 01:21:46.207
put an end to this already.

01:22:07.502 --> 01:22:08.991
Let's see, now.

01:22:27.061 --> 01:22:29.092
<i>100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva!</i>

01:22:47.645 --> 01:22:48.878
Gon...

01:22:49.433 --> 01:22:50.525
What did you do?

01:22:51.622 --> 01:22:56.531
<i>The 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva</i> holds
the power of affection to counter <i>On</i>.

01:22:56.631 --> 01:23:00.530
Which one prevails is up to your strength.

01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:08.053
Snap out of it, Gon!

01:23:16.813 --> 01:23:20.630
The only one who can fight Gon
now is he himself!

01:23:25.074 --> 01:23:28.947
Now, shall we settle this for good?

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:33.921
It's been a long time since
I last fought you here.

01:23:35.461 --> 01:23:37.042
<i>Hyakki Juon...</i>

01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:38.802
<i>Rasetsu.</i>

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:04.019
I won't let you succumb in the darkness!

01:24:09.021 --> 01:24:11.788
You said that you pursued
the power of <i>On</i> -

01:24:11.888 --> 01:24:16.678
to dispel the regrets of the weak.

01:24:16.795 --> 01:24:18.071
That's correct.

01:24:18.171 --> 01:24:21.064
But observing your actions earlier
confirmed it.

01:24:21.164 --> 01:24:26.179
All you're doing is hunt and collect
other people's grudges.

01:24:26.767 --> 01:24:31.733
No matter what you do,
you're a Hunter just like me!

01:24:32.933 --> 01:24:33.988
You're wrong!

01:24:34.876 --> 01:24:39.325
What made you descend to <i>On</i>
might have been me!

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.594
You and me are the opposite sides of a coin.

01:24:43.694 --> 01:24:47.919
We were the same and
merely took different paths.

01:24:48.019 --> 01:24:52.414
Even if that's the case, those paths
will never cross again!

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:58.208
That's exactly why I regret
not stopping you back then,

01:24:58.308 --> 01:25:00.845
despite having been your friend.

01:25:02.866 --> 01:25:05.871
Not having been able to save you is my sin.

01:25:05.971 --> 01:25:09.187
I'll keep fighting you until you're
riddened of the grudge,

01:25:09.287 --> 01:25:12.758
and the anger, hatred, and grudge -

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:15.886
of the perished members of
the Shadow that you carry on!

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:18.144
Nonsense!

01:25:25.141 --> 01:25:26.709
Come back, Gon!

01:25:26.809 --> 01:25:27.833
We...

01:25:27.933 --> 01:25:29.435
are friends, right?!

01:25:44.872 --> 01:25:45.799
What?

01:25:46.721 --> 01:25:47.693
This is...

01:25:50.917 --> 01:25:51.964
Gon...

01:25:55.438 --> 01:25:57.564
I'm back, Killua.

01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:05.847
Your opponent is me, Jed.

01:26:05.947 --> 01:26:07.064
Say what?

01:26:08.618 --> 01:26:10.545
I'll be the one to...

01:26:12.150 --> 01:26:14.028
I'll be the one to..!

01:26:21.457 --> 01:26:22.772
Bastard!

01:26:22.872 --> 01:26:24.736
Stop running your mouth!

01:26:25.736 --> 01:26:28.230
<i>Hyakki Juon: Rasetsu!</i>

01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:29.564
<i>Rock!</i>

01:26:29.664 --> 01:26:30.931
<i>Paper!</i>

01:26:31.031 --> 01:26:34.380
<i>Rock!</i>

01:26:50.141 --> 01:26:52.096
I don't understand.

01:26:52.196 --> 01:26:56.955
Being willing to bring your friends
down with you to carry out revenge.

01:26:57.319 --> 01:27:00.240
But, although I can't put it
into words well...

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:04.730
The frustration for being unable to do
anything to help others...

01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:10.675
I don't agree with your ways,
and it still hurts, but...

01:27:10.775 --> 01:27:13.202
I understand your sadness now.

01:27:13.302 --> 01:27:16.680
We will make sure that that sadness -

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:19.832
won't ever be repeated all over again.

01:27:19.932 --> 01:27:23.461
So don't worry about the future,

01:27:23.561 --> 01:27:25.657
and take a good rest now.

01:27:25.757 --> 01:27:28.293
This can't be...

01:27:29.071 --> 01:27:32.859
What surpasses <i>On</i>'s power
is the heart of compassion -

01:27:32.959 --> 01:27:37.278
which forgives all creation in this world.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:41.781
We both were caught in the past after all.

01:27:41.881 --> 01:27:47.037
But the young ones have the power
to build a new future.

01:27:47.237 --> 01:27:48.733
Have I lost?

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:51.789
To a brat like this...

01:27:51.889 --> 01:27:54.080
But, Netero...

01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:56.958
I will never...

01:27:57.058 --> 01:28:00.191
never regret things turning out this way...

01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:06.297
Our score still hasn't been settled...

01:28:07.374 --> 01:28:09.154
This time,

01:28:09.254 --> 01:28:11.031
I will...

01:28:37.068 --> 01:28:40.695
I'll let it pass to call
today's result a tie.

01:28:42.401 --> 01:28:45.818
But one day we'll settle the score.

01:28:45.918 --> 01:28:47.120
Sure.

01:28:47.386 --> 01:28:48.737
Until then...

01:29:04.242 --> 01:29:05.208
Bottom, huh?

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.572
I'll be the backside of
the Hunters Association,

01:29:10.672 --> 01:29:12.814
in charge of the Shadow's part.

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:15.082
I'll leave the front to you.

01:29:19.718 --> 01:29:22.195
Are you really fine with that?

01:29:29.972 --> 01:29:33.456
I am... for now.

01:29:34.705 --> 01:29:37.377
But, one day...

01:30:01.232 --> 01:30:07.038
May you enter Nirvana where
no opposing sides exist,

01:30:07.138 --> 01:30:09.623
with your heart in peace.

01:30:13.142 --> 01:30:15.374
<i>Hey!</i>

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.465
Kurapika!

01:30:20.031 --> 01:30:22.195
I'm so happy you're safe!

01:30:22.295 --> 01:30:24.842
It's all thanks to you.
I'm grateful.

01:30:24.942 --> 01:30:27.513
No need to, we'd do anything for friends!

01:30:29.438 --> 01:30:33.129
Hey, hey! Aren't I getting ignored here?

01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:34.351
Huh?

01:30:34.451 --> 01:30:36.733
What did you even do this time around?

01:30:37.296 --> 01:30:38.947
Well, let's see...

01:30:42.955 --> 01:30:44.501
I heard it loud and clear.

01:30:44.601 --> 01:30:47.489
You encouraging me while
I was poisoned by <i>On</i>.

01:30:49.001 --> 01:30:51.548
Although your lines were rather cheesy.

01:30:51.648 --> 01:30:54.526
No, uh, that was...

01:30:54.918 --> 01:30:56.257
That aside!

01:30:56.357 --> 01:30:58.625
How did you defeat that Jed guy?

01:30:58.725 --> 01:30:59.776
Well...

01:30:59.876 --> 01:31:02.581
You didn't do a contract with <i>On</i>, did you?
- What?!

01:31:04.846 --> 01:31:07.640
But I was called back by Killua!

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:09.811
Thank you, Killua!

01:31:11.492 --> 01:31:13.723
You did something so absurd again...

01:31:13.878 --> 01:31:15.742
You're really a handful...

01:31:15.842 --> 01:31:18.171
Going that far for friends...

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.581
For a second I thought I'd really die!

01:31:28.743 --> 01:31:31.012
Will Gon's contract last?

01:31:31.112 --> 01:31:33.645
Jed's death is also the death of <i>On</i>.

01:31:33.745 --> 01:31:38.652
His heart has been purified so there's
no need to worry anymore.

01:31:40.079 --> 01:31:42.115
The darkness is gone.

01:32:21.834 --> 01:32:24.256
<i>To all the combat sports fans
around the world...</i>

01:32:24.356 --> 01:32:27.296
<i>no, around the whole universe!</i>

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:31.566
<i>Thank you for waiting!</i>

01:32:32.636 --> 01:32:35.502
<i>Here at the Heaven's Arena,
251 floors above the ground -</i>

01:32:35.602 --> 01:32:37.823
<i>at the height of 991 metres,</i>

01:32:37.923 --> 01:32:39.224
<i>the palace of proud martial artists,</i>

01:32:39.324 --> 01:32:42.659
<i>the world's strongest martial artists
are about to...</i>

01:32:42.759 --> 01:32:44.881
It's kind of amazing...

01:32:44.981 --> 01:32:48.070
how everyone's acting like
nothing happened yesterday.

01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:51.170
So... How were things solved in the end?

01:33:04.588 --> 01:33:06.714
So it was locked away in darkness again?

01:33:06.827 --> 01:33:08.122
Seems like it.

01:33:08.222 --> 01:33:10.549
That's not very reassuring...

01:33:10.649 --> 01:33:11.925
It'll be fine.

01:33:13.099 --> 01:33:18.608
We'll change things so there won't ever
again be a Hunter controlled by <i>On</i>!

01:33:19.103 --> 01:33:20.799
That's the spirit!

01:33:23.232 --> 01:33:24.937
That hurt!
