00:00.482 --> 00:01.384
<i>Previously on "Bel-Air"...</i>

00:01.484 --> 00:02.385
LaMarcus is my ex-boyfriend.

00:02.485 --> 00:03.706
When he got drafted to Philly,

00:03.806 --> 00:04.768
I didn't want to do
the long distance.

00:04.768 --> 00:06.851
But you invited him here, Hilary.

00:07.772 --> 00:09.674
- Erika?
- Philip?

00:09.774 --> 00:11.157
Uh...

00:11.257 --> 00:13.239
<i>She wants me to join her firm
as a senior partner.</i>

00:13.339 --> 00:14.922
Have you spoke to Viv
about this?

00:15.022 --> 00:16.484
Not until there's
anything to say.

00:16.584 --> 00:17.566
Well, you know,
we are hosting

00:17.666 --> 00:19.047
Phil's family reunion
this year.

00:19.147 --> 00:20.530
I'll, uh, stock up
on the alcohol.

00:20.630 --> 00:21.691
For you, of course,
not for them.

00:23.193 --> 00:24.855
<i>It's so cool
that both Will and Carlton</i>

00:24.955 --> 00:26.458
<i>got nominated
for the Founder's Award.</i>

00:26.558 --> 00:28.139
Do you even know
what the Founder's Award is?

00:28.239 --> 00:29.381
Carlton, relax.

00:29.481 --> 00:32.145
<i>Carlton had a panic attack
at the protest.</i>

00:32.245 --> 00:34.308
I don't want this to overshadow

00:34.408 --> 00:36.351
your nomination
for the Founder's Award.

00:36.451 --> 00:38.113
Just know that it means
the world to Carlton.

00:38.213 --> 00:40.316
I will gladly take myself
out of the running.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.598
You got leadership skills.

00:41.698 --> 00:43.400
And D-I schools,
they lookin' for that.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.724
<i>Don't be so quick
to count yourself out.</i>

00:45.824 --> 00:46.965
We have a problem
with Geoffrey.

00:47.065 --> 00:48.808
What is he looking for?

00:48.908 --> 00:49.969
Not what, who.

00:50.069 --> 00:52.192
He's looking for his son.

00:58.360 --> 01:02.306
<i>♪ Bring that bag,

01:02.406 --> 01:06.432

01:13.261 --> 01:15.444
And if I don't have a card
of the same suit...

01:15.544 --> 01:17.746
You can play any card
in your hand.

01:18.988 --> 01:23.093
Except that one.
- What? You said any card.

01:23.193 --> 01:24.656
Yeah, but you just played
the most valuable card

01:24.756 --> 01:26.258
in the entire game.

01:26.358 --> 01:28.021
It's about strategy, too, boo.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.344
Okay, Phil, I don't play
Spades like that.

01:30.444 --> 01:32.346
You and your family
are just so hardcore.

01:32.446 --> 01:35.871
I mean, every game ends
in tears or a fist fight.

01:35.971 --> 01:36.892
Which is why I'm giving you
a crash course

01:36.892 --> 01:38.194
before the family reunion.

01:38.294 --> 01:39.877
And I still have
a lot of work to get done

01:39.977 --> 01:41.979
before everyone gets here, so...

01:44.303 --> 01:48.208
I know you must be exhausted
from your art show,

01:48.308 --> 01:51.332
and it was my idea
to host the reunion,

01:51.432 --> 01:54.176
and I said that I would handle
all the details...

01:54.276 --> 01:56.539
Mm-hmm. But...

01:56.639 --> 01:58.382
I need your help.

01:58.482 --> 02:00.745
Mama just decided
that she doesn't wanna stay

02:00.845 --> 02:02.387
in the suite we got her.

02:02.487 --> 02:06.552
So if you can make sure
the guest room's ready,

02:06.652 --> 02:08.475
and also pick her up,

02:08.575 --> 02:10.398
and find a place for her
to get her nails done...

02:10.498 --> 02:12.240
I mean, who doesn't want
to stay at a penthouse

02:12.340 --> 02:14.383
at the Four Season hotel?
- Right?

02:16.105 --> 02:18.288
I mean, Julius probably got
in her head.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.131
- Here we go.
- Yeah, ever since Dad died,

02:20.231 --> 02:22.494
he's been trying
to control everything

02:22.594 --> 02:24.256
and keep it on his turf.

02:24.356 --> 02:25.618
Please don't let
this competition

02:25.718 --> 02:28.582
between you and your brother
ruin this family reunion.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.905
Okay.

02:31.005 --> 02:34.270
So... you helpin' me out
with Mum, then?

02:34.370 --> 02:36.953
'Cause, I mean, if I send
a car service or Geoffrey,

02:37.053 --> 02:39.997
I...I'll never hear
the end of it.

02:40.097 --> 02:42.041
Yeah, I guess just my emails
and phone calls

02:42.141 --> 02:43.883
will just have to wait.
- Aw, I love you.

02:43.983 --> 02:45.085
You're a saint.
- Mm-hmm. I know.

02:45.185 --> 02:47.888
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

02:47.988 --> 02:49.991
Hey, Geoffrey.

02:51.113 --> 02:52.975
Everything okay?

02:53.075 --> 02:55.077
Do you have time
for a private word?

02:59.243 --> 03:00.466

03:00.566 --> 03:03.029
Yeah, just gotta
make sure I'm ready.

03:03.129 --> 03:04.510
Ready for what,
the apocalypse?

03:04.610 --> 03:05.752
The flag football game

03:05.852 --> 03:07.514
is a Banks family reunion tradition

03:07.614 --> 03:11.099
that my dad and Uncle Julius
take way too seriously.

03:12.502 --> 03:15.165
Oh, yeah, they take it
way too seriously.

03:15.265 --> 03:16.967
Yeah, a little family competition.

03:17.067 --> 03:19.490
Nothin' wrong with that.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.293
Speaking of which, um,

03:21.393 --> 03:25.099
I wanted to talk to you about
this Founder's Award thing.

03:25.199 --> 03:27.342
- Yeah?
- You know, you were right

03:27.442 --> 03:29.524
when you said I didn't know
anything about it.

03:32.929 --> 03:34.231
Yeah?

03:34.331 --> 03:36.875
Yeah, so I did some research.

03:36.975 --> 03:39.318
And I'm not sure yet,

03:39.418 --> 03:41.320
but I wanted to see
how you would feel

03:41.420 --> 03:46.528
if I possibly, you know,
stayed in the race.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.532
Wait, seriously?
- Yeah.

03:50.632 --> 03:53.057
What, you're dying to get
into an Ivy all of the sudden?

03:53.157 --> 03:54.498
I mean,
grades and leadership.

03:54.598 --> 03:56.261
D-I schools look
at all of that stuff.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.023
And this could really help me
stand out.

03:58.123 --> 03:59.825
Yeah, sure. Whatever, Will.

03:59.925 --> 04:02.109
See, man, this is exactly why
I wanted to rap with you.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.390
Look, I'm not trying
to stress you out.

04:03.490 --> 04:04.632
Why would it stress me out?

04:04.732 --> 04:06.234
Because everyone
is worried about you,

04:06.334 --> 04:08.077
especially after the protest.

04:08.177 --> 04:09.518
And so am I.

04:12.702 --> 04:14.085
Uncle Phil thinks

04:14.185 --> 04:17.650
us competing
against each other...

04:17.750 --> 04:19.572
could be triggering.

04:19.672 --> 04:21.775
Right.
'Cause with you in the race,

04:21.875 --> 04:22.897
there's no possible way

04:22.997 --> 04:24.298
I could stand a chance
at winning.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.902
- That is not what he said.
- Yeah, he didn't have to.

04:27.002 --> 04:29.105
Heard it loud and clear.
- Carlton...

04:49.272 --> 04:51.275

for Frederick.

04:52.636 --> 04:54.640

You know, our family's
been through a lot already.

05:06.415 --> 05:07.837
Lord knows we learned
the consequences

05:07.937 --> 05:10.360
of keeping family apart.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.564
That ended bad for all of us.

are not good enough
for this LA traffic.

Well, I didn't realise
you'd be

such a nervous passenger.

06:32.331 --> 06:33.673
- Yes.
- No!

06:33.773 --> 06:36.516
The last time I saw you,
you were a little bitty thing.

06:36.616 --> 06:38.360
You better come over here.
Give me some love.

06:38.460 --> 06:39.520
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.203
Good to see you.
- Oh, good to see you.

06:41.303 --> 06:43.686
Mama, you made it.

06:43.786 --> 06:45.448
Oh, my son.

06:45.548 --> 06:48.452
Ooh, lookin' good.

06:48.552 --> 06:50.536
Ooh.

06:50.636 --> 06:53.460
Too good to even pick up
his own mother.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.701
No, no, no.
Now, see, you just got here

06:54.801 --> 06:55.823
and you're already
startin' trouble.

06:55.923 --> 06:57.506
- No.
- I was handling the details

06:57.606 --> 06:59.107
to make the day perfect.

06:59.207 --> 07:00.109
- Oh.
- And plus I knew

07:00.209 --> 07:01.390
you were in good hands
with Viv.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.673
Oh, if you call
ridin' 80 miles an hour

07:03.773 --> 07:05.556
and runnin' the red lights
good hands.

07:05.656 --> 07:07.118
I was driving
under the speed limit

07:07.218 --> 07:08.640
and it was a yellow light.

07:08.740 --> 07:11.163
Okay, okay, let's, uh--
let's get Mama settled.

07:11.263 --> 07:12.606
- Yup.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

07:12.706 --> 07:13.847
I will show you to your room, Grandma.

07:13.947 --> 07:14.969
- Okay.
- Let me get her bags.

07:15.069 --> 07:17.051
Yeah, not that bag.
Put that down.

07:17.151 --> 07:20.015
'Cause those are my greens
from my garden.

07:20.115 --> 07:22.538
Oh, so these have been
in a hot luggage compartment

07:22.638 --> 07:24.101
for hours. Yum.

07:24.201 --> 07:27.626
I bet you can't find
those kind of greens here.

07:27.726 --> 07:31.811
Well, now who can I get
to help me clean and pick 'em?

07:33.534 --> 07:34.995
- Oh. Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, we can do that.

07:35.095 --> 07:36.518
- Oh.
- That's us.

07:36.618 --> 07:38.039
You don't have to.

07:38.139 --> 07:39.362
- No it's fine.
- You are something else.

07:39.462 --> 07:40.763
- We love doing this.
- Ooh.

07:40.863 --> 07:42.406
Those pants are very tight, Hilary.

07:42.506 --> 07:44.408
Thank you, Grandma.

07:44.508 --> 07:45.610
Remember, Grandma 'Nita said

07:45.710 --> 07:47.011
we need to keep
some of the stem.

07:47.111 --> 07:48.414
That's where the flavour
and the nutrients are.

07:48.514 --> 07:50.216
Hey, Ash,
I got this, a'ight?

07:50.316 --> 07:52.099
I used to help my mum
in the kitchen all the time.

07:53.881 --> 07:56.785
So it seems like everybody
has a role at this reunion.

07:56.885 --> 07:58.227
What did Uncle Phil put you
in charge of, Ash?

07:58.327 --> 08:00.149
Lookin' out
for older relatives.

08:00.249 --> 08:02.192
Lots of dietary restrictions

08:02.292 --> 08:05.677
like no dairy, no sugar,
no red meat.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.641
Hey, Will, have you talked
to Jazz recently?

08:08.741 --> 08:10.684
He's been acting
really distant, busy,

08:10.784 --> 08:12.807
taking his time
responding to my texts.

08:12.907 --> 08:14.489
Mm. Really?

08:14.589 --> 08:15.590
I even invited him
to the family reunion

08:15.590 --> 08:16.852
and he left me on "read."

08:16.952 --> 08:19.095
Yeah, well, you also asked
your ex-boyfriend

08:19.195 --> 08:20.657
to come to Mum's art show.

08:20.757 --> 08:22.540
I would have left you
on "read" too.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.342
I talked to Jazz
about LaMarcus

08:24.442 --> 08:26.345
and he said it was fine.

08:28.127 --> 08:29.470
Is it not fine?

08:29.570 --> 08:31.031
These are
some really leafy greens.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.833
- Will!
- Look, I'm not trying to be

08:32.933 --> 08:34.196
in the middle of you and Jazz.

08:34.296 --> 08:37.801
But finding out that you dated
a top NFL draft pick,

08:37.901 --> 08:39.042
that may hurt
a brother's pride.

08:39.142 --> 08:41.145
I'm just sayin'.
- Yup.

08:41.946 --> 08:43.648
Oh, my God. Okay.
I'm going over to Jazz's house

08:43.748 --> 08:45.691
and we're gonna talk this out,
'cause this is crazy.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.374
Uh, Jazz can wait.
The dessert cannot.

08:48.474 --> 08:49.937
So how's
my sweet potato pie lookin'?

08:50.037 --> 08:51.539
Your pie?

08:51.639 --> 08:53.542
Daddy wants to win
the family pie contest.

08:53.642 --> 08:55.063
Oh, for a pie
you didn't even help make.

08:55.163 --> 08:57.167
So you just
out here cheatin', huh?

09:00.131 --> 09:01.592
Little more nutmeg.

09:01.692 --> 09:03.855
See? I helped.

09:08.742 --> 09:11.045
Yo! 'Sup, G?

09:11.145 --> 09:13.408
- What go on, Will?
- So where you been at, man?

09:13.508 --> 09:15.131
I'm not trying to be the only
non-Banks at this reunion.

09:15.231 --> 09:17.414
And if you are?

09:17.514 --> 09:19.056
I mean, I love
Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv,

09:19.156 --> 09:22.581
don't get me wrong, but--
- It's a bit overwhelming.

09:22.681 --> 09:24.584
- Hmm.
- I get it.

09:24.684 --> 09:26.787
But here's a little secret
about reunions.

09:26.887 --> 09:28.709
Nobody cares, you know?

09:28.809 --> 09:30.312
Everyone's family.

09:30.412 --> 09:32.554
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

09:32.654 --> 09:34.637
But I got you.

09:34.737 --> 09:36.440
I'll be right by your side
to tell you

09:36.540 --> 09:37.681
who's who and what's what.

09:37.781 --> 09:39.324
My man.

09:39.424 --> 09:41.086
- Appreciate that.
- In a bit.

09:41.186 --> 09:43.189
A'ight.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.759
Uh, you left it
in the bedroom.

10:05.859 --> 10:07.562
It was ringing.
- Oh, thanks. I didn't realise.

10:07.662 --> 10:09.744
That you missed calls
from Erika Baker?

10:11.266 --> 10:13.630
Care to explain
why she's calling you?

10:18.476 --> 10:20.019
Yo, C.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.460
Come here.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.104
Yo, did you notice anything,
uh, goin' on with Geoffrey?

10:24.204 --> 10:25.386
Um, no. Why?

10:25.486 --> 10:26.627
Well, I walked
into the office

10:26.727 --> 10:27.789
and he was looking at a photo

10:27.889 --> 10:29.311
of some dude
who looks just like him.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.995
I wonder if it was a picture
of his son?

10:32.095 --> 10:34.398
- Geoffrey's a dad?
- Shh. Yes. Yes, relax.

10:34.498 --> 10:36.400
It's just one of those things
no one really talks about.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.762
Uh, yeah, obviously.

10:37.862 --> 10:39.765
Look, all I know is,
it's complicated.

10:39.865 --> 10:41.767
But don't you want
to know more?

10:41.867 --> 10:43.290
Shit, I know I do.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.452
Look, good luck with that.
You know how secretive

10:45.552 --> 10:47.055
Mum and Dad are
about that stuff.

10:57.689 --> 10:58.410
<i>All right,
I was trying to find</i>

10:58.410 --> 10:59.632
the right time to tell you,

10:59.732 --> 11:01.234
but you were so busy
with the art show.

11:01.334 --> 11:02.796
Then why don't we make now
the right time?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.679
Now?

11:04.779 --> 11:06.781
But the family...

11:08.183 --> 11:09.605
Look, with everything
that's been goin' on

11:09.705 --> 11:11.087
with my firm,
word is getting out.

11:11.187 --> 11:12.249
So it's only natural

11:12.349 --> 11:13.611
that people
are gonna come looking for me.

11:13.711 --> 11:16.214
Uh-huh, and Erika
is one of those people?

11:16.314 --> 11:18.097
Yeah, she's working in LA.

11:18.197 --> 11:20.139
She wants me to consider
an offer with her firm.

11:20.239 --> 11:21.382
Oh, seriously?

11:21.482 --> 11:23.103
Which is why I didn't bother
bringing it up.

11:23.203 --> 11:24.986
Look, I promise you,
I am not gonna make

11:25.086 --> 11:27.490
any big moves without talking
it out with you first.

11:29.332 --> 11:30.833
They're here, they're here!

11:35.901 --> 11:37.803

11:37.903 --> 11:39.125

11:56.608 --> 11:58.471
Duane, Sheena, Dominique.

11:58.571 --> 12:00.674
All second cousins.

12:00.774 --> 12:02.837
That's Uncle Chuck
and Aunt Pokey.

12:02.937 --> 12:04.480
Pokey?

12:04.580 --> 12:06.482
Yeah. Pokey.

12:06.582 --> 12:09.646
Ah, the twins,
Nadia and Nicole.

12:09.746 --> 12:11.569
The aunties,

12:23.845 --> 12:25.548
You got all this?

12:25.648 --> 12:28.232
Uh, just give it to me
one more time.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.034
'Ey.

12:30.134 --> 12:31.516
Frank, what's up?

12:31.616 --> 12:32.837
How you doin'? Good to see you.

12:32.937 --> 12:35.320
Pookie. Pokey, right?

12:35.420 --> 12:36.683
Uh, Michael, right?

12:36.783 --> 12:38.725
Good to see you, bro.

12:38.825 --> 12:39.927
What's goin' on?
I ain't seen you since--

12:40.027 --> 12:41.410
oh, my God. It's been so long.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.372
Auntie.

12:43.472 --> 12:47.237
Auntie, Auntie.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.821
Hi, Uncle Earl.
I'm Ashley.

12:49.921 --> 12:51.222
Let me know if there's
anything you need help with.

12:51.322 --> 12:53.325
Yeah.

12:56.929 --> 12:58.392
Don't be offended, Ash.

12:58.492 --> 13:01.156
Uncle Earl is like that
with everybody.

13:01.256 --> 13:02.718
Rude?

13:02.818 --> 13:04.721
He's a man of few words.

13:04.821 --> 13:06.763
Our oldest living uncle.

13:06.863 --> 13:08.866
He has a lot of stories
to tell.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.897
- Come on in, everybody.
- Welcome, everyone.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.219
Make yourself at home, please.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.781
Our house is your house.

13:19.881 --> 13:21.303
There is plenty of food.

13:21.403 --> 13:23.105
Oh, and a lot of drinks
back there.

13:23.205 --> 13:24.428
- Is that my sister-in-law?
- Ah!

13:24.528 --> 13:25.989
Girl, aah!

13:26.089 --> 13:28.512
- Welcome, Julius.
- Good to see you.

13:28.612 --> 13:29.955
Baby bro.
- Big bro.

13:30.055 --> 13:31.677
- Come on.
- I see you dressed up.

13:31.777 --> 13:34.360
I try to get fly for you.
Come on, now.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.642
Look at you.
- Hey.

13:35.742 --> 13:37.204
- Always clean.
- Kyle?

13:37.304 --> 13:39.127
I can't believe it.
Last time I saw you,

13:39.227 --> 13:40.448
you were, like,
half this height.

13:40.548 --> 13:41.691
Now look how big you are.

13:41.791 --> 13:43.052
Oh, welcome.

13:43.152 --> 13:44.614
- Hey, Aunt Viv.
- Oh.

13:44.714 --> 13:47.418
And speakin' of growin',

13:47.518 --> 13:48.620
you didn't do much.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.142
Hey, ready to get slaughtered

13:50.242 --> 13:51.304
in this flag football game, cuz?

13:51.404 --> 13:53.346
Yeah, yeah.
Keep talkin' trash.

13:53.446 --> 13:55.348
The trophy's a lock
for us this year.

13:55.448 --> 13:56.430
That's right.

13:56.530 --> 13:58.633
Anyone thirsty?
We have sparkling water,

13:58.733 --> 14:00.837
uh, juice, champagne.

14:00.937 --> 14:02.318
Ah, I'd be more comfortable

14:02.418 --> 14:04.001
with a double Hennessy
on the rocks.

14:04.101 --> 14:06.003
Uh, are you sure
about that, bro?

14:06.103 --> 14:08.006
'Cause, uh, you gonna need
all your faculties

14:08.106 --> 14:09.168
when we whup your ass
in this game.

14:09.268 --> 14:11.130
Drunk or sober,
you ain't whuppin' shit.

14:11.230 --> 14:13.414
- Uh-oh.
- Uh, language, boys.

14:13.514 --> 14:14.975
But I wouldn't mind
a little taste, now.

14:15.075 --> 14:16.338
- Mama.
- Okay?

14:16.438 --> 14:17.579
- What?
- Since when you be tastin'?

14:17.679 --> 14:20.102
- Since I'm grown.
- Um, yeah, Mama, I got you.

14:20.202 --> 14:21.624
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:21.724 --> 14:23.907
- Yo, they a trip.
- Yo, Kyle,

14:24.007 --> 14:25.470
what's in the bags?

14:25.570 --> 14:27.873
Ha!

14:27.973 --> 14:29.875
Yeah,
I'm a little surprised.

14:29.975 --> 14:31.438
Didn't know we were doing
T-shirts this year.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.320
No one even wears them
after reunion weekends.

14:33.420 --> 14:35.963
No T-shirts?
Mama, you hear this?

14:36.063 --> 14:38.326
Daddy'd be rollin' over
in his grave right now.

14:38.426 --> 14:41.051
Hey, Frank.
- "Banks Family Reunion,

14:41.151 --> 14:42.853
rooted in love."
I like that.

14:42.953 --> 14:45.216
It also looks
like free advertising.

14:45.316 --> 14:47.539
My brother's a car salesman.
- Get your facts right.

14:47.639 --> 14:49.743
I own ten dealerships
across North Carolina.

14:49.843 --> 14:51.545
Voted number one dealership

14:51.645 --> 14:54.589
in the Southern United States
just last month, Philip.

14:54.689 --> 14:56.711
Yeah. Says so right here.

14:56.811 --> 14:58.154
'Scuse me, Junior.

14:58.254 --> 15:00.236
And if you need
that family discount,

15:00.336 --> 15:01.959
Unc got you.

15:02.059 --> 15:04.242
Got my son right here
a SUV last year

15:04.342 --> 15:06.965
'cause he finally turned in
some decent grades.

15:07.065 --> 15:08.888
Okay, my grades only slipped

15:08.988 --> 15:10.530
'cause I cracked a rib
playing lacrosse

15:10.630 --> 15:11.692
and had to miss school.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.014
Everybody break a rib.

15:13.114 --> 15:14.416
Yo, Carlton plays lacrosse.

15:14.516 --> 15:16.739
Oh, yeah.
We made playoffs last year.

15:16.839 --> 15:18.100
Oh, really?

15:18.200 --> 15:19.943
Well, we went
all the way to state, so...

15:20.043 --> 15:22.026
Hmm. Mm.

15:22.126 --> 15:23.829
Wow. Must run in the family.

15:23.929 --> 15:26.252
Mm-hmm.
It's revolutionary.

15:28.334 --> 15:29.917
All right, Banks family...

15:31.859 --> 15:33.001
Now, as Viv knows,

15:33.101 --> 15:36.286
I have been anticipating
this day for a long time.

15:36.386 --> 15:38.488
And we all appreciate
you traveling

15:38.588 --> 15:40.450
out here to California.

15:40.550 --> 15:42.213
Now, I may live
out here on the West Coast,

15:42.313 --> 15:44.376
but my roots remain
in the South.

15:44.476 --> 15:45.817
Ain't that right, Mama?
- Yes, they do.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.422
Yes, they do.
- Yes. Right.

15:48.522 --> 15:51.466
And my goal is to hold tightly
to the Yamacraw tradition

15:51.566 --> 15:53.629
that my father Joe started
many years ago.

15:53.729 --> 15:54.790
- Mm.
- All right.

15:54.890 --> 15:56.432
Doesn't matter where we are,

15:56.532 --> 15:57.434
it's who we're with.

15:57.534 --> 15:58.314
- Mm.
- Okay.

15:58.414 --> 16:00.718
So, please, enjoy the day.

16:00.818 --> 16:02.681
Our house is your house.

16:02.781 --> 16:04.003
- Whoo.
- Yo, yo, yo, hold up.

16:04.103 --> 16:06.446
Okay, okay.

16:06.546 --> 16:07.527
Come on, now, you see me.

16:07.627 --> 16:10.651
Yes... Julius.
Did you have a question?

16:10.751 --> 16:12.093
Yes.

16:12.193 --> 16:14.016
I was just thinkin',
if we're, you know,

16:14.116 --> 16:15.178
keepin' in tradition

16:15.278 --> 16:17.621
and it is indeed
our real intention...

16:17.721 --> 16:18.783
- Mm.
- Then we all know

16:18.883 --> 16:21.186
we are not celebrating nothin'

16:21.286 --> 16:23.028
without giving God his due.
Amen?

16:23.128 --> 16:24.831
all: Amen.
- Amen.

16:24.931 --> 16:27.314
- I said amen.
- I said amen to you.

16:27.414 --> 16:29.316
Amen.

16:29.416 --> 16:31.280
I see the devil stays busy
out here

16:31.380 --> 16:33.763
in the city
of so-called angels.

16:33.863 --> 16:35.405
All right?

16:35.505 --> 16:38.208
- Mm.
- Anyway, as the eldest,

16:38.308 --> 16:40.212
I would like to do the honours.

16:40.312 --> 16:41.252
Thank you, thank you.

16:41.352 --> 16:42.775
So ski-doot-doot-doot.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.056
Oh.

16:44.156 --> 16:45.739
All right, everybody,
can we, uh,

16:45.839 --> 16:47.661
bow our heads, please?

16:47.761 --> 16:50.025
Heavenly Father,
we are gathered here today...

16:50.125 --> 16:51.627
Mm-mm-mm.
Not while God's watching.

16:51.727 --> 16:54.230
Thank you for bringing
the Banks family together.

16:56.653 --> 16:59.117
<i>♪ Let's go a little deeper,
I'm a people pleaser ♪</i>

17:04.504 --> 17:06.166
- Boom. Ten points.
- Ah.

17:06.266 --> 17:07.288
- Ooh.
- My son.

17:07.388 --> 17:09.130
- Okay, C boy.
- My boy.

17:09.230 --> 17:10.432
I didn't know you knew
how to play dominoes, okay.

17:10.432 --> 17:12.094
It's just basic
grade school math.

17:12.194 --> 17:14.458
Right.

17:14.558 --> 17:16.621
So Uncle J, when'd you get
started at the dealership?

17:16.721 --> 17:17.902
Oh, I used to help out

17:18.002 --> 17:19.705
in the body shop in high school
and I never left.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.387
Created the largest network

17:21.487 --> 17:23.310
of Black-owned dealerships
in my 20s.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.112
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.173
So did you go
to business school for that?

17:26.173 --> 17:27.475
No, come on.

17:27.575 --> 17:29.518
College, fancy degrees,
that's Phil's lane.

17:29.618 --> 17:31.721
There's more than one path
to success,

17:31.821 --> 17:32.923
and I'm living proof of that--

17:33.023 --> 17:36.167
that application
is more important than theory.

17:36.267 --> 17:37.929
15. You got that, nephew?
- Oh, sh--

17:38.029 --> 17:39.131
Oh, yeah. I got you.
Got you, got you.

17:39.231 --> 17:40.613
Yeah, well,

17:40.713 --> 17:42.695
there's nothing wrong
with a solid education, and...

17:42.795 --> 17:45.219
- Ooh.
- Bam. I'ma take that same 15.

17:45.319 --> 17:46.541
- Okay.
- Write that down, nephew.

17:46.641 --> 17:49.144
Okay, well,
there's nothing more valuable

17:49.244 --> 17:51.588
than hustle, bare hands,
and grit.

17:51.688 --> 17:53.190
But you still gotta have
a vision

17:53.290 --> 17:55.873
for how you make
your next fortune.

17:55.973 --> 17:58.276
Self-made man. I like that.

17:58.376 --> 18:00.520
Yeah, and Kyle,
once he gets hisself focused,

18:00.620 --> 18:03.164
we're gonna put him
in the family business too.

18:03.264 --> 18:05.166
I mean, I am already workin'
part-time

18:05.266 --> 18:08.150
and helpin' out
on a new ad campaign, so...

18:10.993 --> 18:13.497
I'm sorry, nephew,
but, uh...

18:13.597 --> 18:15.300
you just left 15 on the table.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.462
- Ugh.
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

18:17.562 --> 18:19.025
If you don't call it,
it doesn't count.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.669
How many times I tell you
you got to call your money?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.272
My bad. Sorry.

18:24.372 --> 18:25.673
Sorry's for suckers, Kyle.

18:25.773 --> 18:28.918
In business and life,
pay attention.

18:29.018 --> 18:31.021
Damn.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.544
It's all good, little man.

18:34.666 --> 18:36.649
I hope everyone brought
their swimsuits,

18:36.749 --> 18:39.693
because I am lookin' forward
to relaxing,

18:39.793 --> 18:42.176
drinkin' some cocktails
in the hot tub.

18:42.276 --> 18:44.419
- Mm-hmm.
- Question, Viv.

18:44.519 --> 18:47.463
- Mm-hmm.
- Exactly how does any of this

18:47.563 --> 18:50.186
fit into our fish fry theme?

18:50.286 --> 18:51.709
Fish fry?

18:51.809 --> 18:54.392
Well, Phil didn't say
anything about a fish fry.

18:54.492 --> 18:56.835
He did miss
some of the family Zoom calls.

18:56.935 --> 18:59.238
Don't worry, baby.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.763
We got this.

19:01.863 --> 19:03.885
I'm gonna need some cornmeal

19:03.985 --> 19:05.848
and some seasoned salt.

19:05.948 --> 19:08.771
Okay? And flour.

19:08.871 --> 19:11.655
And oh, you know we gonna
need some white bread...

19:11.755 --> 19:13.418
And some hot sauce.

19:13.518 --> 19:16.542
And about, uh, three bags
of, uh, sugar

19:16.642 --> 19:18.645
for the sweet tea.

19:19.246 --> 19:20.667
Where are you, Jazz?

19:20.767 --> 19:21.749
Hey, Mr. Banks.

19:21.849 --> 19:23.832
It is always good to see you, frat.

19:23.932 --> 19:24.753
You know I'm always down

19:24.853 --> 19:25.795
for a good time
with the family.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.038
Uh, uh, uh,
that is not LaMarcus.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.643
Boy, you better come here
and hug me.

19:31.743 --> 19:32.925
Come here.

19:33.025 --> 19:36.048
Oh!
- Hey, LaMarcus.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.781
Daddy, why is LaMarcus here
at our family reunion?

19:45.881 --> 19:48.145
Well, I mean, you invited him
to your mother's art show.

19:48.245 --> 19:49.467
I assumed you'd be fine.
- What?

19:49.567 --> 19:51.310
Plus, your Uncle Julius
hasn't had

19:51.410 --> 19:53.713
a pro ball player
at his reunion.

19:53.813 --> 19:54.874
See, this is my reunion.

19:54.974 --> 19:56.977
This how we do things.

19:59.701 --> 20:01.362
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

20:01.462 --> 20:04.326
- I'm team Jazz all day.
- Okay, then great.

20:04.426 --> 20:07.130
So you agree he can know
nothing about this.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.434
So keep your mouth shut, cuzzo.

20:11.316 --> 20:12.819
Thanks.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.347
What? Thank you so much.

20:19.447 --> 20:20.749
I'm so glad you all like them.

20:20.849 --> 20:23.072
You know, that's actually
one of my most recent pieces.

20:23.172 --> 20:25.555
My queen,
we are up for Spades.

20:25.655 --> 20:27.879
Uh, well, they wanted
to see my collection

20:27.979 --> 20:29.280
so I don't want to be rude.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.844
Uh, ladies, do you mind
if I borrow her for a second?

20:31.944 --> 20:34.328
I need my teammate. Thank you.

20:34.428 --> 20:36.611
See?
- Oh. So we're a team?

20:36.711 --> 20:38.092
Oh, 'cause teammates
usually talk

20:38.192 --> 20:39.534
and share information.

20:39.634 --> 20:40.755
Are you still upset
about that Erika thing?

20:40.755 --> 20:42.178
'Cause it's not a thing.

20:42.278 --> 20:43.699
It was a thing.
A very big thing.

20:43.799 --> 20:45.703
So please don't play me
like I'm crazy.

20:45.803 --> 20:47.805
We were in college.

20:48.526 --> 20:50.529
Baby...

20:51.971 --> 20:53.973
So... Spades?

20:55.216 --> 20:57.959
Fine. Let's do this.

20:58.059 --> 20:59.721
- Let's do this.
- Mm-hmm.

20:59.821 --> 21:02.485
- Who's your favourite son?
- Ooh.

21:02.585 --> 21:04.568
It's all right.

21:04.668 --> 21:06.451
- So, Mama...
- Yeah.

21:06.551 --> 21:08.733
Phil seems to think
that once you sell your house,

21:08.833 --> 21:10.216
you gonna come out here
and live with him.

21:10.316 --> 21:12.178
I told you, Mama not leavin'
North Carolina.

21:12.278 --> 21:13.981
And, Mama, I said

21:14.081 --> 21:15.583
that you have
a mind of your own

21:15.683 --> 21:17.185
and that maybe you'd like
a change of scenery.

21:17.285 --> 21:18.747
You ain't got the time
to take care of nobody.

21:18.847 --> 21:20.149
And all that weight's
gonna fall on Viv.

21:20.249 --> 21:21.511
You ready for that, sis?

21:21.611 --> 21:22.673
Baby, don't let him
throw you, all right?

21:22.773 --> 21:24.194
All he's trying to do
is get in your head,

21:24.294 --> 21:25.336
in your head, that's all.
- I'm just trying to pay

21:25.336 --> 21:26.758
attention to the board.
- Oh, well, good,

21:26.858 --> 21:29.282
'cause it's your turn.

21:29.382 --> 21:30.843
- Shit.
- Just pay attention

21:30.943 --> 21:32.166
to the first card
that was played, all right?

21:32.266 --> 21:34.168
So you know what--ah, ah.
- Ah, ah, ah.

21:34.268 --> 21:36.290
No board talk.
She is a grown woman.

21:36.390 --> 21:38.254
Handle your bid-ness.
- Yes, baby,

21:38.354 --> 21:40.497
'cause when she sat down
at the table,

21:40.597 --> 21:42.619
we thought
that she could hold her own.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.703
Study long, study wrong,
baby, baby.

21:45.803 --> 21:47.787
It's all right, baby.
Take your time. Take your time.

21:47.887 --> 21:49.549
Do what you can.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.433
- Oh!
- Oh!

21:52.533 --> 21:53.514
- Boom. That's game.
- Oh!

21:53.614 --> 21:55.196
That's my partner
right there.

21:55.296 --> 21:56.999
That's my partner.
- Oh. This is my house.

21:57.099 --> 21:59.643
Mama, I told you to stop
drinkin' when we play.

21:59.743 --> 22:03.168
Okay, say one more thing
about my drinkin',

22:03.268 --> 22:04.809
and I'ma kick your ass.

22:04.909 --> 22:06.172
- That's my dear.
- Who house is it?

22:06.272 --> 22:07.493
Come here. Chest bump, babe.
Come here.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.575
Ohh! Mm.

22:09.675 --> 22:10.817
I wasn't sure
what you wanted,

22:10.917 --> 22:13.521
so I got you
a little bit of everything.

22:15.844 --> 22:19.309
Sweet tea and Hilary's biscuits
are my fave.

22:19.409 --> 22:21.412
So I got you two.

22:44.202 --> 22:46.186
Yay. Whoo.

22:46.286 --> 22:48.388
Come on.

22:48.488 --> 22:49.910
Let's go, let's go.

22:51.372 --> 22:52.713
Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

22:52.813 --> 22:55.278
- Yeah, sure.
- Uh, without the child.

22:55.378 --> 22:57.380
All right. Come on.

22:59.703 --> 23:00.925
I need to be clear.

23:01.025 --> 23:02.327
Us getting back together,

23:02.427 --> 23:04.330
no matter how good
all of this feels,

23:04.430 --> 23:05.571
that's not happening.

23:05.671 --> 23:07.755
A'ight, so this feels good?

23:09.637 --> 23:10.779
We split up for a reason.

23:10.879 --> 23:13.903
You broke my heart.

23:14.003 --> 23:16.586
Because I had bigger dreams
than just being your arm candy.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.350
Look, I've matured
since then.

23:19.450 --> 23:21.753
Oh, but I need to be clear too.

23:21.853 --> 23:23.755
I'm not the one
who started this.

23:23.855 --> 23:25.038
You called me.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.280
Now I'm here again
doin' a solid for your father.

23:27.380 --> 23:29.483
Right.
And I appreciate that.

23:29.583 --> 23:31.166
Look, I have no agenda.

23:31.266 --> 23:32.607
I mean, beyond visitin' the fam

23:32.707 --> 23:35.172
and grabbin' a plate
of Grandma 'Nita's catfish.

23:35.272 --> 23:37.254
Good. 'Cause I have a man.

23:37.354 --> 23:39.356
So why isn't he here then?

23:41.520 --> 23:42.902
Hey, LaMarcus,

23:43.002 --> 23:44.824
Julius wants to do
a pushup challenge.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.007
We're taking bets.
- Duty calls.

23:48.889 --> 23:51.032
Hilary, your father
wanted me to tell you

23:51.132 --> 23:54.797
it's almost time
for the anonymously judged

23:54.897 --> 23:55.999
pie contest.

23:56.099 --> 24:00.164
Oh, also, his one is called
Hot Pie Summer.

24:09.197 --> 24:12.222
Okay, we've got five votes

24:12.322 --> 24:14.745
for pie A, Hot Pie Summer.

24:14.845 --> 24:17.549
Ooh.

24:17.649 --> 24:20.472
Five votes for pie B,
Super Fly Pie.

24:22.134 --> 24:24.078
Hey, uh, can we disqualify
a pie

24:24.178 --> 24:25.920
just based off the name alone?

24:26.020 --> 24:27.242
Okay, Hilary.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.084
It's down to the last two.

24:29.184 --> 24:31.186
Time for you to pick a winner.
- Let's go.

24:35.072 --> 24:36.494
Mmm. Mmm, mmm.

24:36.594 --> 24:38.216
This is so good, y'all.

24:38.316 --> 24:39.458
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

24:39.558 --> 24:41.140
Uh-huh, I can taste
the nutmeg.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.502
Definitely a hot pie summer.

24:42.602 --> 24:45.186
- All right. All right.
- Okay. Okay.

24:45.286 --> 24:48.230
Ooh, but it's definitely
Super Fly Pie for me.

24:48.330 --> 24:50.673
Oh!

24:50.773 --> 24:52.715
Yes, I knew baby girl's
taste buds

24:52.815 --> 24:55.200
could not deny the secret
of my pie filling.

24:55.300 --> 24:56.321
- What is it, lemon flavour?
- Yes, it is.

24:56.421 --> 24:57.683
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

24:57.783 --> 24:58.583
I'm supposed to believe
that you would vote

24:58.583 --> 25:00.406
against your own recipe?
- Huh?

25:00.506 --> 25:02.729
What? Wait a minute.

25:02.829 --> 25:04.572
Did Hilary make the pie
or did you, Phil?

25:04.672 --> 25:05.853
Oh, okay. Okay.

25:05.953 --> 25:06.935
Guys, you know what?
- What's goin' on?

25:07.035 --> 25:08.377
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

25:08.477 --> 25:10.019
It's all in good fun anyway.

25:10.119 --> 25:12.463
Yes. And you know what?
We have water balloons,

25:12.563 --> 25:13.904
drinks, everything in the back.
- So, uh,

25:14.004 --> 25:16.028
we're doin' anything
to win now?

25:16.128 --> 25:18.310
Cheating's okay?
Well, maybe that's what they do

25:18.410 --> 25:19.552
out here in these LA streets.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.116
- Cheating? Cheating?
- Yes.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.278
Okay, okay.
Like that time I caught you

25:24.378 --> 25:26.201
dealing from the bottom
of the deck in poker?

25:26.301 --> 25:28.484
Huh? How about that?
- Man, that was two years ago.

25:28.584 --> 25:29.645
Oh, two years ago?

25:29.745 --> 25:30.887
Two years, two months,
it don't matter.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.029
Two weeks. It don't mean--
cheating's cheating.

25:32.029 --> 25:33.932
Phil, you gotta let go. Release.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.034
Hey.

25:36.435 --> 25:37.577
Yo, G.

25:37.677 --> 25:39.539
Yo, man, you missed it.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.901
Yo, I'm pretty sure
Hilary tanked

25:41.001 --> 25:42.663
Uncle Phil's pie on purpose.

25:42.763 --> 25:45.307
There was, yeah,
a little revenge move

25:45.407 --> 25:48.190
for inviting LaMarcus
to the party, I'm sure.

25:48.290 --> 25:49.913
Hey, you gotta love
the family drama.

25:50.013 --> 25:51.795
Mmm.

25:51.895 --> 25:55.500
- Right? Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Hilary don't play.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.407
Look, G, I don't mean to be
all in your business,

26:00.507 --> 26:01.769
but, you know,

26:01.869 --> 26:03.872
I just been thinkin'
about it all day and...

26:08.318 --> 26:10.521
He's 22. Lives in London.

26:12.203 --> 26:14.206
His name's Frederick.

26:16.409 --> 26:19.513
I thought we always kept it
real with each other?

26:19.613 --> 26:21.035
How come you never told me?

26:28.665 --> 26:30.007
To be honest with you,

26:30.107 --> 26:32.190
I wasn't sure
what you might think.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.597
Only one way to find out.

26:44.366 --> 26:46.589
So it was a closed adoption,

26:46.689 --> 26:49.233
but Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv
know where Frederick is?

26:49.333 --> 26:50.875
Mm-hmm.
Your uncle had some people

26:50.975 --> 26:52.277
look into it for me years ago.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.679
I asked him to keep tabs
on Frederick

26:53.779 --> 26:56.323
so I could see
how he was being raised,

26:56.423 --> 26:59.286
if he was... happy.

26:59.386 --> 27:01.830
- And he is?
- Hmm.

27:03.392 --> 27:06.256
And I'm grateful for that.

27:06.356 --> 27:08.659
But I also asked Phil
to promise me

27:08.759 --> 27:11.102
never to give me the details
of his whereabouts.

27:11.202 --> 27:12.144
And why is that?

27:14.407 --> 27:16.410
I've lived a life, Will.

27:18.252 --> 27:20.254
I, uh...

27:20.775 --> 27:22.118
Used to move with a gang
in London

27:22.218 --> 27:25.603
who made me believe hustling
was the only way to succeed.

27:25.703 --> 27:27.925
And it was true
for a good long time

27:28.025 --> 27:29.808
until it wasn't, you know?

27:29.908 --> 27:31.130
So what happened?

27:31.230 --> 27:32.812
I had a sort of Uncle Phil too.

27:32.912 --> 27:36.096
Promised me
he'd look after my family.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.219
But I had to cut off
all contact

27:38.319 --> 27:40.302
or my family
might be in danger.

27:40.402 --> 27:42.825
So you left to protect them?

27:42.925 --> 27:44.928
Mm.

27:45.809 --> 27:49.735
I came to the States.
Started a whole new life.

27:52.739 --> 27:55.202
Frederick's mum
couldn't handle it alone.

27:55.302 --> 27:58.767
So she, uh...

27:58.867 --> 28:00.869
gave him up.

28:02.031 --> 28:04.034
Damn, G.

28:05.276 --> 28:07.278
So what now?

28:08.921 --> 28:10.923
I don't know, Will.

28:12.285 --> 28:14.468
I mean...

28:14.568 --> 28:17.492
disruptin' his life now
seems selfish and unfair.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.557
I'm not even sure
if I'm ready to face

28:20.657 --> 28:22.078
how he feels about me,
you know?

28:22.178 --> 28:23.641
Yeah.

28:23.741 --> 28:26.464
I'm not sure anybody's ready
for that conversation.

28:30.469 --> 28:32.472
I mean, at least I have
answers now.

28:36.238 --> 28:38.781
And I'm...

28:38.881 --> 28:41.264
pretty sure Frederick
would love

28:41.364 --> 28:43.367
to hear the real story.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.651
Not just the one
he's makin' up in his head.

28:50.336 --> 28:51.679
Perhaps.

28:51.779 --> 28:54.122
I bet he'll see, uh,
what a good dude you are.

29:01.511 --> 29:03.635
Someone any son would be proud
to call his dad.

29:07.039 --> 29:09.042
I appreciate you, Will.

29:18.414 --> 29:19.796
Hey, son.

29:19.896 --> 29:22.960
So, uh, we up next
for flag football.

29:23.060 --> 29:25.565
This is our big shot
at bringin' home that trophy.

29:25.665 --> 29:27.607
Oh, yeah. Cool.
I feel good about this.

29:27.707 --> 29:28.649
Me too.

29:28.749 --> 29:31.092
Me too 'cause we need
this win.

29:31.192 --> 29:32.613
Absolutely.

29:32.713 --> 29:36.859
Which is why I'm bringin' in
a secret weapon.

29:36.959 --> 29:39.403
Yo, Carlton,
ready to do this?

29:43.448 --> 29:45.611
Yeah. I am.

29:57.467 --> 29:59.210
Don't I get dessert?

29:59.310 --> 30:00.651
So you do talk.

30:00.751 --> 30:02.854
I got a mouth, don't I?

30:02.954 --> 30:04.817
Well, you haven't had
much to say with it all day.

30:04.917 --> 30:06.920
Uh...

30:07.561 --> 30:10.024
Get me a couple
of those cookies,

30:10.124 --> 30:12.126
and I'll talk plenty.

30:19.617 --> 30:21.960
Yo.

30:22.060 --> 30:24.844
So I hear your dad brought in
a ringer for the game.

30:26.066 --> 30:28.208
Definitely a dick move
my dad would make.

30:28.308 --> 30:30.311
Yeah. Yeah, um...

30:30.952 --> 30:32.975
I guess they're cut
from the same cloth.

30:33.075 --> 30:34.737
Is it me
or have they gotten worse?

30:34.837 --> 30:36.539
Oh, definitely worse.

30:36.639 --> 30:37.862
Man.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.744
Is that gonna be us
in 30 years?

30:39.844 --> 30:41.507
You know, fuckin'
with our sons' heads?

30:41.607 --> 30:43.309
Questionin' all their
life choices?

30:43.409 --> 30:44.911
Taking out all our shit
on them,

30:45.011 --> 30:47.234
making sure
that they don't feel

30:47.334 --> 30:50.599
like they're ever good enough?
- Yeah.

30:50.699 --> 30:52.641
Well, anyway,

30:52.741 --> 30:54.124
at least with LaMarcus
on your team,

30:54.224 --> 30:57.448
you're gonna win the game,
so that'll make your dad happy.

30:57.548 --> 31:00.052
Yeah. I guess.

31:00.152 --> 31:02.655
And I'll just get
another speech

31:02.755 --> 31:05.699
about bein' a weak-ass
piece of shit.

31:05.799 --> 31:08.523
It's fine. I'm used to it.

31:14.210 --> 31:16.353
Do you play?

31:16.453 --> 31:18.777
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

31:19.698 --> 31:21.701
Thanks.

31:23.743 --> 31:25.866
<i>Round one. Fight!</i>

31:27.629 --> 31:29.651
So you fought
in World War II?

31:29.751 --> 31:32.655
Retired Lieutenant Colonel.

31:32.755 --> 31:35.980
332nd Fighter Group.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.144
They called us the Red Tails.

31:39.244 --> 31:41.748
Wait, so you were
in the Tuskeegee Airmen.

31:41.848 --> 31:45.633
Oh, girl, I flew missions
all over Europe.

31:45.733 --> 31:47.735
Here.

31:51.060 --> 31:54.124
Wow. I've read about you.

31:54.224 --> 31:57.249
So you helped
integrate the military.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.852
- That's right.
- You guys were all heroes.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.535
I didn't die
for this country,

32:02.635 --> 32:05.240
but I sure as hell
fought for it.

32:16.134 --> 32:18.337
I heard you got some skills
on the court.

32:20.661 --> 32:22.683
Yeah, I get down
a little bit.

32:22.783 --> 32:24.445
Yeah, I played football
at Bel-Air,

32:24.545 --> 32:27.129
so I know it can be tough

32:27.229 --> 32:29.773
being labelled
angry and defiant

32:29.873 --> 32:31.936
when you're really
just driven and ambitious.

32:32.036 --> 32:33.978
Yeah, man. All the time.

32:34.078 --> 32:35.941
They mad 'cause I like winnin'.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.905
I bet that AAU team
hit different, right?

32:39.005 --> 32:41.068
Keep raisin' the bar.
- Yeah.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.751
Hey, I bet it gets real
at the pro level.

32:43.851 --> 32:45.393
Man, I gotta get on the field

32:45.493 --> 32:48.437
and prove myself every day.

32:48.537 --> 32:51.922
Every workout, every practice,
every game.

32:52.022 --> 32:54.146
No days off.

32:56.268 --> 32:59.893
It's all or nothin' for me.

32:59.993 --> 33:01.996
Which is why I'm not gonna stop
until I get Hilary back.

33:06.322 --> 33:07.784
Wait, what was that?

33:07.884 --> 33:08.866
I thought y'all was,
like, you know,

33:08.966 --> 33:09.866
cool like that.
- I mean,

33:09.966 --> 33:11.188
that's what I told her.

33:11.288 --> 33:13.632
I'm playin' the friend role
for now, but...

33:13.732 --> 33:16.195
I'll get back in there.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.278
And when I do,
I'm not lettin' her go again.

33:24.907 --> 33:26.449
We're gonna eat y'all up.

33:26.549 --> 33:29.253
This ain't no peewee football,
you feel me?

33:31.996 --> 33:34.860
So we gettin' players
out the combine, Philip?

33:36.202 --> 33:37.584
- Hike!
- One Mississippi,

33:37.684 --> 33:38.866
two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

33:40.248 --> 33:41.309
Come on, Kyle.

33:41.409 --> 33:43.752
Yeah!
That's my son right there.

33:43.852 --> 33:45.515
Ahhh!

33:45.615 --> 33:47.617
It's okay, keep your head
in the game, son.

33:48.659 --> 33:49.960
It's too easy.

33:50.060 --> 33:52.224
<i>♪ This is how we do it ♪</i>

33:53.826 --> 33:55.408
- Oh!
- Good catch.

33:55.508 --> 33:58.653
Here.

33:58.753 --> 34:00.856
Will, get inside!
Defence, defence!

34:00.956 --> 34:03.419
- Whoa! Oh!
- Ah! Get him!

34:03.519 --> 34:05.221
How you like that
shake 'n' bake, Little C?

34:09.888 --> 34:11.890
- It ain't tackle!
- Let's go.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.675
Kyle, what the hell is that?

34:15.775 --> 34:18.519
<i>♪ I'm kinda buzzed

34:18.619 --> 34:19.561

34:19.661 --> 34:22.565
Mm.

34:22.665 --> 34:24.006

34:24.106 --> 34:26.370
Get out of here.

34:26.470 --> 34:28.853
Got him!

34:28.953 --> 34:30.215
Ah?

34:30.315 --> 34:32.699
Yes! Come on. Come on, babe.

34:32.799 --> 34:34.862
All right, boys, we need
a touchdown to tie the game.

34:34.962 --> 34:36.103
You're gonna post,
you're gonna slant,

34:36.203 --> 34:39.227
I'm gonna find you.
- Yellow team leads 28-21.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.188
Break.

34:40.288 --> 34:41.591
Phil, this is
your last chance.

34:43.453 --> 34:45.235
Can't even beat me
with a pro player, bro.

34:45.335 --> 34:46.477
Man, just make sure
you wipe your prints

34:46.577 --> 34:47.739
off my trophy before
you hand it to me, a'ight?

34:47.739 --> 34:49.821
Hike the ball.

34:52.505 --> 34:54.888
Don't mess it up, son.

34:54.988 --> 34:55.930
Hike!

34:56.030 --> 34:58.774
Let's go!

34:58.874 --> 35:01.056
Go long! Go! Go!

35:01.156 --> 35:04.481
Kyle, damn, get your ass up.

35:14.615 --> 35:15.996
Yeah!

35:16.096 --> 35:18.960
Let's go, baby!
I don't even play football!

35:19.060 --> 35:21.064
We won! We won!

35:23.627 --> 35:27.012
Good job, Kyle!

35:27.112 --> 35:29.856
Feel it, son!
- Whoo!

35:29.956 --> 35:31.958
This is how we do it, Philip.

35:33.761 --> 35:35.303
That's what I'm talkin' about.

35:35.403 --> 35:36.665
That's what I'm talkin' about.

35:36.765 --> 35:38.868
Number one dealership
in the southern US.

35:38.968 --> 35:40.309
Hey, man. Hey, man.

35:40.409 --> 35:42.232
And I know how to win a game

35:42.332 --> 35:44.235
when the game is on the line.

35:44.335 --> 35:46.537
Banks Family Reunion.
We did it again.

35:50.543 --> 35:51.926
- You okay, Mum?
- Oh.

35:52.026 --> 35:54.649
- You need Phil. I'll get him.
- No, no, no, no.

35:54.749 --> 35:56.752
Have a seat.
- Oh.

35:59.475 --> 36:04.002
This was a good day.
Thank you, Viv.

36:07.046 --> 36:08.187
You're welcome.

36:08.287 --> 36:10.791
I mean, but this was
all because of Phil, so...

36:10.891 --> 36:12.032
Please.

36:12.132 --> 36:13.515
Behind every good reunion

36:13.615 --> 36:14.796
is a man takin' all the credit

36:14.896 --> 36:16.439
and the woman
doin' all the work.

36:19.382 --> 36:22.367
Joe and I planned
a million of these.

36:22.467 --> 36:25.371
Mm, mm. I know what it takes.

36:25.471 --> 36:27.473
He was a big part
of these things.

36:28.875 --> 36:32.000
I know you miss him.
- I do.

36:36.525 --> 36:39.229
But at the end of the day,
I don't remember

36:39.329 --> 36:41.633
any of the arguments
I had with Joe

36:41.733 --> 36:45.016
or how busy my own life was.

36:47.260 --> 36:50.244
It's these moments, like now,

36:50.344 --> 36:52.968
being with family,

36:53.068 --> 36:55.671
that's what stays with you.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.020
You know,
you don't have to be alone.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.583
We have more
than enough rooms here,

37:04.683 --> 37:06.786
so whenever you're ready--
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

37:06.886 --> 37:09.550
Thank you.
But no, thank you, honey.

37:09.650 --> 37:11.433
I would not live

37:11.533 --> 37:13.595
with neither one
of those boobs.

37:13.695 --> 37:17.241
No, baby, I love
my independence too much.

37:17.341 --> 37:19.043
Mm-mm.
- Uh, you need a refill?

37:19.143 --> 37:21.146
I won't tell Phil.

37:21.946 --> 37:24.970
This time,
put a little more vodka.

37:26.874 --> 37:29.437
- But shh.
- Amen.

37:36.567 --> 37:38.870
How's the knee?

37:38.970 --> 37:41.353
Better than your back.

37:41.453 --> 37:43.636
Two grown-ass men
trying to keep up

37:43.736 --> 37:45.839
with a pro baller.
What were we thinkin'?

37:45.939 --> 37:47.321
Yeah, I was thinkin'
I was gonna kick your ass.

37:47.421 --> 37:50.004
Of course.

37:50.104 --> 37:52.008
Can't stop trying
to one-up me, huh?

37:52.108 --> 37:53.409
Me?

37:53.509 --> 37:54.771
If Dad told us
to clean our rooms,

37:54.871 --> 37:55.852
you had to do it faster.

37:55.952 --> 37:57.214
You were the first
to get dressed.

37:57.314 --> 37:58.656
You were the first
to the breakfast table always.

37:58.756 --> 38:00.459
'Cause I had to be
good at something.

38:00.559 --> 38:01.540
Come on, I'm the big brother

38:01.640 --> 38:03.383
and you the one
Dad believed in.

38:03.483 --> 38:04.985
We both know
that's not true.

38:05.085 --> 38:07.188
Yes, it is.

38:07.288 --> 38:08.509
I asked him one time, I said,

38:08.609 --> 38:10.613
"Hey, Dad,
can I go to college?"

38:11.613 --> 38:15.599
He said,
"Nah. That's a Phil thing."

38:15.699 --> 38:18.964
You was the one he was always
bettin' on to win.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.066
Not me.

38:22.749 --> 38:24.992
But I proved him wrong, though.

38:26.714 --> 38:31.701
You know, for me,
you are the big brother.

38:31.801 --> 38:34.625
Takin' care of Mama.
Right there doin' your part.

38:36.567 --> 38:39.071
You know, hostin' this reunion,

38:39.171 --> 38:42.054
I just needed to feel
like I was doin' mine.

38:43.457 --> 38:48.243
Losin' Denise,
it's been tough.

38:48.343 --> 38:51.187
Bein' a single father, man,
and wearin' all the hats...

38:55.673 --> 38:57.676
Then let's share the load.

38:59.799 --> 39:03.103
Maybe we can hold on
to some stuff together.

39:12.415 --> 39:14.679
<i>♪ Just lookin' back
at our past ♪</i>

39:14.779 --> 39:16.942
Hey, son.

39:18.224 --> 39:19.045
I'm sorry, Dad.

39:19.145 --> 39:20.447
I know how bad
you really wanted

39:20.547 --> 39:22.549
to bring home the trophy.

39:23.791 --> 39:26.034
And I know that you've
never missed that pass.

39:27.876 --> 39:31.722
Uh, I guess it just, uh,
must not be my day.

39:39.132 --> 39:40.594
Love you, son.

39:40.694 --> 39:42.697
Love you, too, Dad.

39:47.743 --> 39:50.087
I'm proud of you.

39:50.187 --> 39:53.531
And, uh,
I never want you to think

39:53.631 --> 39:56.876
that I don't believe in you, okay?

39:59.119 --> 40:01.322
I'm always betting
on you to win.

40:03.164 --> 40:05.167
Always.

40:08.732 --> 40:11.075
What's goin' on, huh?

40:11.175 --> 40:11.996
What up, man?

40:12.096 --> 40:13.959
Job well done
out there, Will.

40:14.059 --> 40:15.241
Thanks for being our third man.

40:15.341 --> 40:17.964
Well, that's what I do, man.

40:18.064 --> 40:20.688
I, uh, appreciate you
sharing your story too.

40:20.788 --> 40:21.970
- Yeah.
- You know?

40:22.070 --> 40:23.411
The hustle.
- Mm-hmm.

40:23.511 --> 40:24.533
Fightin' for everything
you get.

40:24.633 --> 40:27.137
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:27.237 --> 40:29.700
I feel like
that's me all the way.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.703
Listen, you never stop
goin' for yours.

40:31.803 --> 40:33.666
People might underestimate us,

40:33.766 --> 40:35.548
but they never
see us comin', either.

40:35.648 --> 40:37.851
Prove 'em wrong.

40:39.533 --> 40:40.555
All right?
- Sure.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.657
There you go.

40:50.868 --> 40:54.153
- Yo, C...
- Hey, what's up?

40:55.956 --> 40:57.578
Wanted to talk to you
about the Founder's Award.

40:57.678 --> 41:01.984
Oh, actually, yeah, I, uh...

41:02.084 --> 41:03.746
you know what?
I changed my mind.

41:03.846 --> 41:05.268
I'm not afraid
of a little competition.

41:05.368 --> 41:06.870
You should stay in the race.
- Oh, that's good.

41:06.970 --> 41:08.192
'Cause I was gonna do that anyway.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.757
Hey, man, I'm warning you,

41:11.857 --> 41:13.119
I'm not playin' to lose.

41:13.219 --> 41:15.161
Oh, well, I'm quite adamant

41:15.261 --> 41:16.283
that, uh, I'm gonna
kick your ass.

41:16.383 --> 41:17.926
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

41:18.026 --> 41:20.289
- We'll see. We'll see.
- May the best man win.

41:21.590 --> 41:24.674
Trust me, he will.

41:34.487 --> 41:37.431
- Damn good day.
- Yeah.

41:37.531 --> 41:40.195
Thanks for all you did
to make it happen.

41:40.295 --> 41:42.838
I know you had
a lot going on too.

41:42.938 --> 41:45.062
Work and life
will always be there.

41:48.427 --> 41:51.731
I'm sorry again
for not bringing up Erika.

41:51.831 --> 41:54.495
Although, I do think
that it makes sense

41:54.595 --> 41:56.938
for me to keep my options open.

41:57.038 --> 42:00.503
Which means she'll be
back in our lives again.

42:00.603 --> 42:02.986
Yeah, but it's nothin'
that we can't handle together.

42:03.086 --> 42:05.089
Hmm?

42:08.613 --> 42:10.076
Yo.

42:10.176 --> 42:11.718
This is a pretty dope reunion,
Uncle Phil.

42:11.818 --> 42:13.680
I really like your family.
- Thanks, nephew.

42:13.780 --> 42:14.802
And I'm not surprised
you fit right in.

42:14.902 --> 42:16.724
Oh, me either.

42:16.824 --> 42:19.008
You know,
family's really important.

42:19.108 --> 42:21.351
Which is why I feel
like we need to help Geoffrey.

42:23.513 --> 42:25.517
He needs to see his son.

42:32.325 --> 42:34.589
Can I get everybody's
attention, please?

42:34.689 --> 42:36.591
First off,

42:36.691 --> 42:38.514
I have Phil's permission
to speak.

42:38.614 --> 42:39.876
I'm just gonna say that.

42:39.976 --> 42:40.997
Okay. Okay?

42:41.097 --> 42:43.401
All right. All right.

42:43.501 --> 42:44.802
Don't want no trouble
with my brother.

42:44.902 --> 42:46.405
Okay.

42:46.505 --> 42:49.048
I want to take a moment
to personally thank

42:49.148 --> 42:52.132
Phil and his beautiful family
for hosting

42:52.232 --> 42:55.217
the most incredible
Banks Family Reunion.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.582
Did we have a good time?

42:59.682 --> 43:00.904
all: Yeah!

43:01.004 --> 43:03.187
Did we have a good time?

43:03.287 --> 43:04.830
all: Yeah!
- Yeah.

43:06.732 --> 43:08.395
Um... Phil, come up here, man.

43:08.495 --> 43:09.916
- All right, Phil.
- All right.

43:10.016 --> 43:11.238
All right, all right.

43:11.338 --> 43:12.960
- Love you, bro.
- I love you, bro.

43:13.060 --> 43:15.804
Hey, uh, we have
one more order of business.

43:15.904 --> 43:17.287
Yes. Yes.

43:17.387 --> 43:19.730
Now, J and I, we want to start
a new tradition

43:19.830 --> 43:20.931
of honouring family.

43:21.031 --> 43:24.015
We have true heroes
in our lineage

43:24.115 --> 43:25.457
that we would like
to recognise.

43:25.557 --> 43:27.179
- Yes.
- Amen.

43:27.279 --> 43:29.583
Uncle Earl, this is for you.

43:29.683 --> 43:31.385
Thank you for your service.

43:31.485 --> 43:34.049
Whoo! Whoo!

43:41.058 --> 43:43.922
We love you, man.
We love you.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.844
Let's get the party started,
shall we?

43:45.944 --> 43:47.647
Huh?
all: Yeah!

43:47.747 --> 43:50.932

44:59.684 --> 45:01.427
Okay, okay.

45:01.527 --> 45:03.910
Ah. It's our song, remember?

45:04.010 --> 45:06.073
I remember.
