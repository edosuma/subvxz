02:37.672 --> 02:41.073
<i>Hello, my name is Violet...</i>

02:41.242 --> 02:47.408
<i>...and I was born into a world
you may not understand.</i>

02:56.591 --> 02:58.559
Coming up. Holding airspeed.

02:58.727 --> 03:01.025
Echo altitude.
Forward and lateral drift.

03:01.196 --> 03:03.164
Numbers falling fast from here.

03:03.331 --> 03:08.860
On my mark.
Three, two, one, mark.

03:31.893 --> 03:34.361
<i>Time lock engaged.</i>

03:34.729 --> 03:36.287
<i>Valves, primary and secondary--</i>

03:39.000 --> 03:41.696
<i>Compositive pressure reached.</i>

03:42.437 --> 03:43.961
<i>Five--</i>

04:33.088 --> 04:34.715
-Freeze!
-lt's a trap.

04:34.889 --> 04:37.153
Stay where you are! Don't move!

04:42.997 --> 04:45.295
The man's down. All clear, sir.

04:46.101 --> 04:49.366
Touch nothing, obviously.

04:52.107 --> 04:53.904
<i>Do not leave the building.
Squadrons...</i>

04:54.075 --> 04:56.839
<i>...initiate Area 1 4 procedures.</i>

04:57.011 --> 05:00.503
-Hemophages.
-No surprise.

05:03.318 --> 05:05.252
Flat-space technology.

05:05.420 --> 05:08.116
Dimension-compressing. Very rare.

05:08.590 --> 05:11.218
lt's odd.
What was their exit strategy?

05:11.860 --> 05:14.226
How'd they expect to transport
the blood out of here?

05:14.395 --> 05:17.626
-Unless there was no exit strategy.
-Then what's the point?

05:17.799 --> 05:21.428
What if they didn't come to take blood?
What if they came to infect it?

05:21.603 --> 05:24.470
My God. Cross.

05:28.710 --> 05:30.644
Poor bastard.

05:35.116 --> 05:39.951
<i>Yes, I was born into a world
you might not understand.</i>

05:40.121 --> 05:42.248
<i>The trouble began when
an American weapons lab...</i>

05:42.423 --> 05:44.914
<i>...discovered an obscure virus
in Eastern Europe...</i>

05:45.093 --> 05:46.924
<i>...that had been around
for centuries.</i>

05:47.262 --> 05:50.857
<i>They tried to modify it to create
faster and stronger soldiers.</i>

05:51.032 --> 05:56.265
<i>Instead, they created a more
contagious form of the disease...</i>

05:56.437 --> 06:00.931
<i>...a strain called HGV,
Hemoglophagic Virus.</i>

06:01.309 --> 06:05.370
<i>And what do you know,
the disease got out.</i>

06:06.080 --> 06:09.516
<i>And that's when
everything changed.</i>

06:09.784 --> 06:12.685
<i>As previous ages
were defined by terrorism...</i>

06:12.854 --> 06:16.449
<i>...this one was defined
by a fear of disease.</i>

06:17.692 --> 06:21.093
<i>Because one of the side effects
of the disease was longer teeth...</i>

06:21.262 --> 06:23.856
<i>...the media decided
to call it vampirism.</i>

06:24.032 --> 06:26.227
<i>I guess it sold more papers.</i>

06:26.901 --> 06:30.268
<i>The medical establishment took it
upon itself to protect its public.</i>

06:30.438 --> 06:33.930
<i>At first, requiring victims to wear
identifying armbands.</i>

06:35.143 --> 06:39.239
<i>Then rounding them up
in special camps and facilities.</i>

06:39.781 --> 06:44.047
<i>Until finally, people just
stopped hearing from them.</i>

06:44.953 --> 06:48.912
<i>The day the trouble began for me
was the day I learned I was pregnant.</i>

06:52.260 --> 06:54.728
<i>Violet, my God.</i>

06:54.996 --> 06:57.726
<i>The same day I lost my husband...</i>

06:57.899 --> 07:00.925
<i>...my future, my life.</i>

07:02.904 --> 07:06.670
<i>And I, too, disappeared deep inside
a faceless camp...</i>

07:06.841 --> 07:11.744
<i>...subjected to the indignity of
a forced life of endless examination...</i>

07:11.913 --> 07:15.576
<i>...dissection, experimentation.</i>

07:16.284 --> 07:21.517
<i>Like others, the disease started to
progressively change me physically.</i>

07:23.291 --> 07:27.250
My eyesight was sharper.
My hearing, more acute.

07:27.428 --> 07:30.727
<i>Bones, stronger. Healing faster.</i>

07:30.899 --> 07:34.562
<i>Life span, shorter. A lot shorter.</i>

07:34.736 --> 07:38.035
<i>Twelve years, maximum,
infection to death.</i>

07:38.206 --> 07:42.836
<i>Unlike others, I converted with only
a mild sensitivity to light.</i>

07:43.011 --> 07:46.071
<i>Like others, however,
I required frequent transfusions...</i>

07:46.247 --> 07:48.807
<i>...and it didn't help
that I was pregnant.</i>

07:49.484 --> 07:51.850
<i>And, no, we weren't superhuman.</i>

07:52.020 --> 07:55.683
<i>Though we were a lot faster and
a lot stronger than everyone else...</i>

07:55.857 --> 07:58.655
<i>...we die just like everyone else.</i>

07:58.826 --> 08:03.320
<i>And just like everyone else,
without help, we stayed dead.</i>

08:04.232 --> 08:08.532
<i>And though I was resuscitated back
to life for further experimentation...</i>

08:08.703 --> 08:13.936
<i>...the one I'd carried inside me
for nearly nine months, my baby...</i>

08:14.108 --> 08:16.076
<i>...wasn't so lucky.</i>

08:16.244 --> 08:18.303
<i>Those few still on the outside...</i>

08:18.479 --> 08:22.438
<i>...embraced the slur bestowed
upon them, ''vampires''...</i>

08:22.617 --> 08:24.278
<i>...formed a resistance...</i>

08:24.452 --> 08:26.317
<i>...went underground...</i>

08:26.487 --> 08:28.478
<i>...and began fighting back.</i>

08:30.458 --> 08:32.482
<i>And so began...</i>

08:34.495 --> 08:36.793
<i>...the Blood Wars.</i>

08:39.267 --> 08:41.962
<i>And now, the leader of the militant,
medical establishment...</i>

08:42.135 --> 08:43.933
<i>...running this phobic world...</i>

08:44.105 --> 08:47.700
<i>...is Vice-Cardinal
Ferdinand Daxus.</i>

08:48.476 --> 08:49.807
-Vice-cardinal.
-As you know...

08:49.978 --> 08:51.878
...our campaign against
the Hemophages...

08:52.046 --> 08:53.343
...has been highly effective.

08:53.514 --> 08:55.573
We've managed to eradicate
almost all of them.

08:55.750 --> 08:59.481
But, sir, the few that are left
have proven incredibly determined.

08:59.654 --> 09:01.918
Terrorist attacks are at their
highest level ever.

09:02.957 --> 09:06.017
lt's not because they're determined.
lt's because they're desperate.

09:06.194 --> 09:10.324
Because they know we're on the verge
of wiping them out completely.

09:10.498 --> 09:11.726
For the last 1 0 years...

09:11.899 --> 09:14.868
...in partnership with
Laboratories for Latter Day Defense...

09:15.036 --> 09:16.970
...l've overseen the development
a weapon...

09:17.138 --> 09:20.665
...that can locate and kill every
Hemophage on the planet in days.

09:20.842 --> 09:23.743
-ls there an ETA, sir?
-Now.

09:26.214 --> 09:30.617
A courier is retrieving it to bring here
to the Archministry as we speak.

09:53.107 --> 09:56.406
XPD-1 54.
Clearance, classified courier.

09:56.577 --> 09:58.636
l'm expected.

09:59.447 --> 10:03.349
<i>Reverse-engineer DNA

10:03.518 --> 10:05.042
Remove your head-covering.

10:12.894 --> 10:15.021
Remove your eye-covering.

10:30.244 --> 10:32.974
<i>Preliminary verification
substantiated.</i>

10:47.128 --> 10:48.595
Please...

10:49.931 --> 10:51.193
...have a seat.

11:09.117 --> 11:12.280
-Mind if l ask what's on the menu?
-The usual.

11:13.421 --> 11:16.686
Retinal testing to detect
the presence of contacts or dyes.

11:16.858 --> 11:19.190
Metabolic sensing to make
certain your metabolism...

11:19.360 --> 11:21.055
...is within human range.

11:21.229 --> 11:23.493
Pulse, respiration.

11:23.664 --> 11:26.690
Just have to make sure
you're human.

11:35.943 --> 11:37.205
lf you were a Hemophage...

11:37.378 --> 11:41.405
...we'd already have detected tissue
repair at a microcellular level.

11:57.265 --> 12:01.531
So, what would happen if one
were to fail any of these tests?

12:01.702 --> 12:02.930
Nothing good.

12:03.104 --> 12:07.370
Please remove all articles of clothing
and proceed into the scanner.

12:35.937 --> 12:39.703
Your clothing and personal items
have been sterilized, XPD-1 54.

12:49.550 --> 12:53.452
-May l ask you a question?
-Feel free.

12:53.988 --> 12:56.081
-Do you know what this is about?
-Should l?

12:56.424 --> 12:58.392
No, it's highly classified.

12:58.559 --> 13:00.117
l've been cleared to debrief you...

13:00.294 --> 13:01.727
...because your consciousness...

13:01.896 --> 13:05.593
...of the gravity of this situation may
increase your motivation to complete.

13:06.334 --> 13:09.599
l've never failed to complete.

13:11.505 --> 13:15.066
The Hemophages are a dying species
on the verge of nonexistence.

13:15.243 --> 13:16.505
We've developed a weapon...

13:16.677 --> 13:19.145
...that will push them
past that brink, into extinction.

13:19.313 --> 13:20.780
lf this weapon's so important...

13:20.948 --> 13:23.143
...why not have it delivered
by armored convoy?

13:23.317 --> 13:25.683
The convoy you refer
to is departing as we speak.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.151
The Hemophages will do anything in
their power to stop and immobilize it.

13:29.323 --> 13:31.484
lt is, of course, a decoy.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.595
XPD-1 54, you'll be receiving
a case containing a weapon.

13:36.097 --> 13:37.587
l don't have to tell you.

13:37.765 --> 13:40.461
Under no circumstances
should you open it.

13:40.635 --> 13:42.432
You're right.

13:43.537 --> 13:45.300
You don't have to tell me.

13:52.647 --> 13:53.636
<i>Identify.</i>

13:54.415 --> 13:57.748

<i>Copy, XPD- 1 54.

14:15.236 --> 14:18.501
Everything in order, XPD-1 54?

14:21.509 --> 14:23.204
One hundred percent,
comrade doctor.

14:54.075 --> 14:56.543
You're quite certain
everything is in order?

14:57.044 --> 14:58.033
Positively.

15:00.047 --> 15:01.844
Enter your DNA to confirm receipt.

15:02.316 --> 15:05.080
l can only confirm receipt of
the container, not its contents.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.482
That's acceptable.

15:16.230 --> 15:18.892
Opening the case is strictly forbidden.
You understand this?

15:19.633 --> 15:20.622
Perfectly.

15:20.801 --> 15:25.204
The contents are set to self-destruct
in event of non-delivery...

15:26.374 --> 15:28.899
...in exactly nine hours from now.

15:40.855 --> 15:45.656
What is your condition, XPD-1 54?
Are you functional?

15:56.003 --> 15:58.631
XPD-1 54.
Clearance, classified courier.

15:58.806 --> 16:00.740
-Get on the ground!
-On your knees!

16:00.908 --> 16:02.307
-Get down!
-What is going on?

16:02.476 --> 16:04.944
You were entered
and processed 1 5 minutes ago.

16:05.112 --> 16:07.205
Then it wasn't me,
you dumb son of a bitch.

16:07.381 --> 16:09.576
Check my lD. You've got a mite.

16:09.950 --> 16:14.353
l repeat, XPD-1 54,
are you functional?

16:14.522 --> 16:17.923
l don't know what you're talking about.
l'm 1 00 percent functional.

16:18.793 --> 16:20.488
<i>Security breach! Security breach!</i>

16:20.694 --> 16:24.027
<i>Stage yellow alert!

17:04.305 --> 17:06.933
<i>Intercept, intercept.

<i>Unarmed intruder!

17:54.755 --> 17:58.316
<i>Facility infiltration.
All security forces at stations.</i>

17:58.492 --> 18:01.984
<i>All security forces at stations.
Facility infiltration.</i>

18:02.162 --> 18:03.595
<i>All security forces at stations.</i>

18:03.764 --> 18:05.595
How did a Hemophage
get past the screens?

18:05.766 --> 18:09.361
Don't know. Maybe meta-suppressants
to subordinate blood characteristics.

18:11.972 --> 18:14.839
<i>All security forces at stations.</i>

18:15.009 --> 18:18.638
<i>Facility infiltration.
All security forces at stations.</i>

18:18.812 --> 18:21.645
<i>All security forces at stations.</i>

18:48.976 --> 18:50.876
-How did she do that?
-She must have...

18:51.045 --> 18:52.478
...some sort
of gravity leveler.

18:52.646 --> 18:54.079
Whatever it is, it's ours now.

18:54.248 --> 18:55.909
She's not going to make it out alive.

18:56.250 --> 18:59.344
<i>Sir, we've ID'd her.
Plague victim.</i>

18:59.520 --> 19:02.011
<i>She was confined to this facility
for experimentation...</i>

19:02.189 --> 19:03.383
<i>...until she escaped...</i>

19:03.557 --> 19:06.549
<i>...after the forced termination
of her pregnancy 1 2 years ago.</i>

19:07.094 --> 19:09.790
<i>Violet Song jat Shariff.
Tell me I'm wrong.</i>

19:09.964 --> 19:12.455
<i>-You're wrong.
-Why are you doing this?</i>

19:12.933 --> 19:17.165
Because l hate humans
with every fiber of my being...

19:17.338 --> 19:20.136
...and l'll kill every
single one of them...

19:20.307 --> 19:22.502
...almost as quickly
as they'll try and kill me.

19:22.676 --> 19:25.611
-You used to be human.
-But not anymore, right?

19:25.779 --> 19:28.145
l got sick, and now
l'm something less than human.

19:28.315 --> 19:31.011
Something worthy of extermination.

19:31.185 --> 19:32.482
<i>It's academic now, isn't it?</i>

19:32.653 --> 19:35.417
You won't make it out of here
with that case.

19:35.589 --> 19:36.817
Watch me.

19:51.105 --> 19:53.471
-She's on the ceiling!
-Shoot! Shoot!

21:05.245 --> 21:07.577
<i>-lt's me.
-Did you get it?</i>

21:07.748 --> 21:09.215
Yeah.

21:09.783 --> 21:11.910
But they're serious about
not letting me keep it.

21:12.086 --> 21:15.544
<i>Fine. The objective is
the destruction of the weapon.</i>

21:15.723 --> 21:18.453
<i>If you can't make delivery,
destroy it.</i>

21:18.625 --> 21:21.059
Copy that. Will determine
nature and destroy.

21:21.228 --> 21:23.594
<i>No, V. The attack on
the blood bank failed.</i>

21:23.764 --> 21:25.026
<i>You cannot.</i>

21:25.199 --> 21:28.032
<i>Under no circumstances can you
look inside that case.</i>

21:28.202 --> 21:31.399
<i>If you are compromised,
you must destroy it immediately.</i>

21:31.572 --> 21:33.631
<i>-Read?
-Read.</i>

23:31.458 --> 23:32.482
Oh, shit.

24:28.048 --> 24:30.710
<i>-lt's me.
-3-D me.</i>

24:33.620 --> 24:36.612
-Are you clear?
-Negative. They're everywhere.

24:36.790 --> 24:39.258
-l don't know if l can make it.
-You're carrying the bomb?

24:39.426 --> 24:42.190
-Of course.
-Then detonate it. Now.

24:42.362 --> 24:44.956
lt'll level the entire block.

24:45.299 --> 24:49.030
May l suggest an alternative?
Open the case and use the weapon.

24:49.202 --> 24:53.969
Negative. Do not open that case, V.
Detonate right now.

24:54.374 --> 24:57.036
Nerva, listen.
You know it doesn't matter to me.

24:57.210 --> 24:59.178
l'll be dead in 36 hours,
no matter what.

24:59.346 --> 25:02.179
But every human for a quarter mile
doesn't have to die with me.

25:02.349 --> 25:04.374
l'm telling you
this is not subject to debate.

25:04.551 --> 25:07.019
The entire fate of our race
is tied up in that case.

25:07.187 --> 25:12.124
Detonate the bomb, destroy the case,
destroy everything. Now.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.654
What about the Archministry?

25:16.830 --> 25:18.593
Goodbye, V.

25:19.099 --> 25:22.125
V, l said goodbye.

25:24.504 --> 25:26.096
Yeah.

25:27.441 --> 25:28.908
Goodbye.

25:59.106 --> 26:01.540
We got her. We got visual.

26:02.342 --> 26:04.207
-Third quadrant.
-She's in the crowd.

26:04.378 --> 26:06.278
Stay on her.

26:13.253 --> 26:15.881
lt's not her. Go! Go, go!

26:16.723 --> 26:19.521
-Seal all quadrant.
-Check it out.

26:32.272 --> 26:35.139
<i>-V, what the hell is going on?
-l'm clear.</i>

26:35.308 --> 26:38.072
l told you to destroy the weapon.

26:38.245 --> 26:39.576
l said, l'm clear.

26:41.748 --> 26:43.010
You have the case?

26:44.684 --> 26:46.743
-Affirmative.
-Bring it in.

26:47.054 --> 26:50.581
-What's your status?
-The Needle. ln the Chinois Gau.

26:54.061 --> 26:55.050
Ten minutes.

28:50.510 --> 28:52.978
Bravo, V. Bravo.

28:53.146 --> 28:55.637
No one but you
could have pulled this off.

28:55.815 --> 28:57.544
lt's not a weapon.

28:57.717 --> 28:59.207
What are you talking about?

28:59.386 --> 29:02.583
lt's not a weapon. lt's a child.
A human child.

29:02.756 --> 29:04.724
You opened the case.

29:04.891 --> 29:09.328
What difference does it make?
l risked my life for nothing.

29:14.034 --> 29:16.901
l think l had to know
what l was willing to die for.

29:25.178 --> 29:28.636
-You see? Nothing.
-Nothing.

29:28.815 --> 29:31.579
lt's not a weapon. lt's a child.

29:31.751 --> 29:35.710
lt's both.
lt's a weapon and a child.

29:35.889 --> 29:39.017
lts blood is swarming with
cultured antigens...

29:39.192 --> 29:42.059
...that would kill all of us on contact.

29:42.562 --> 29:45.622
lf they atomize its tissues
into the atmosphere...

29:45.799 --> 29:49.826
...it would be like insecticide
to people like you and me.

29:50.003 --> 29:53.666
lt would find us,
and it would kill us.

29:53.840 --> 29:54.898
All of us.

29:57.344 --> 30:00.507
Nerva, wait. lf there's an accelerator
for HGV in this child's blood...

30:00.680 --> 30:03.080
<i>....then so is the counter-analog
for decelerating it.</i>

30:03.617 --> 30:05.778
What are you saying, V?

30:05.952 --> 30:08.216
A cure?

30:08.955 --> 30:11.822
Wouldn't it be better than
infecting innocent people?

30:12.359 --> 30:14.725
This child could provide the choice.

30:14.894 --> 30:17.886
lf there's a choice, V,
l've already made it.

30:18.999 --> 30:20.967
lt's a child.

30:23.470 --> 30:25.904
You can go now. Your work is done.

30:46.693 --> 30:48.160
lt was a projection.

30:49.929 --> 30:52.056
Don't over-think it.
Just turns out l was right.

30:52.232 --> 30:53.824
We're getting the hell out of here.

31:05.578 --> 31:07.637
-She went up.
-So go after her.

31:07.814 --> 31:10.749
The Blood Chinois control
the top 1 0 floors of this building.

31:11.518 --> 31:14.453
Whatever they want, give it to them.

31:49.322 --> 31:52.553
You're not Archministry.

31:52.759 --> 31:55.785
<i>You're not even vampire....</i>

31:55.995 --> 31:58.725
You're Blood Chinois.

31:59.099 --> 32:00.566
Let me pass.

32:01.101 --> 32:03.831
Sorry, Violet. Can't do.

32:04.337 --> 32:06.703
You're going to lose resources, Kar.

32:08.975 --> 32:10.465
Can't be helped.

32:11.611 --> 32:15.240
But l don't think you're
going to make it off this roof.

32:17.350 --> 32:18.647
Watch me.

34:41.828 --> 34:43.261
Hey.

34:45.130 --> 34:47.463
What are you doing up there, huh?

34:49.835 --> 34:51.132
Hey.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.701
lt's a nice view, huh?

34:58.444 --> 35:00.674
Why don't you...

35:00.847 --> 35:04.510
...help me up
so l can see it too.

35:07.153 --> 35:09.815
Here. Give me your hand.

35:13.826 --> 35:15.794
Give me your hand.

35:15.962 --> 35:17.554
Help me up. Come on.

35:27.540 --> 35:29.064
lt's okay.

35:32.912 --> 35:34.140
Come here.

35:34.314 --> 35:37.374
What do you think you're doing?
You trying to get yourself killed?

35:38.952 --> 35:40.510
Come on.

36:08.881 --> 36:10.712
Stop it. Seal the building.

36:10.883 --> 36:14.080
Any other Phages inside,
l want them hunted down and killed.

36:14.754 --> 36:17.018
Violet Song jat Shariff.

36:17.190 --> 36:20.387
Seal the Needle. Hunt down
and kill any Hemophages inside.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.357
Easy, Violet.

36:22.528 --> 36:25.622
-Do you know who l am?
-How could l not?

36:26.332 --> 36:30.462
Tyrant. Egomaniac.
Narcissist.

36:30.637 --> 36:33.162
That about sums it up,
doesn't it?

36:33.339 --> 36:37.776
Yes, it may be true.
l may have quirks.

36:37.944 --> 36:39.411
But that doesn't mean l'm stupid.

36:39.579 --> 36:42.104
And it certainly doesn't mean
that you make a single move...

36:42.281 --> 36:43.805
...without me knowing about it.

36:43.983 --> 36:45.746
You would've killed me
a long time ago.

36:46.152 --> 36:48.586
Listen, the boy is useless to you.

36:48.755 --> 36:52.987
He's laboratory-bred,
vegetative, practically brain-dead.

36:53.159 --> 36:55.992
Just give him to me,
and you're on your way.

36:56.162 --> 36:59.791
And then you can use him to kill me
and everybody like me.

37:01.134 --> 37:02.624
He's not what you think.

37:02.802 --> 37:04.326
No?

37:04.504 --> 37:06.028
What is he then?

37:09.142 --> 37:10.370
He's my son.

37:19.686 --> 37:21.517
-Hey, Daxus?
-What?

37:22.455 --> 37:24.480
You're full of shit.

37:28.761 --> 37:31.855
Cover your ears.
Cover your ears!

37:34.000 --> 37:36.833
<i>Metro Five is boarding.</i>

37:42.008 --> 37:44.568
<i>Stand clear. Doors closing.</i>

37:48.881 --> 37:51.475
Damaged? Are you damaged?

38:13.072 --> 38:14.869
What am l doing?

38:20.680 --> 38:22.443
Hey!

38:23.116 --> 38:25.846
Park it. Right there.

38:29.088 --> 38:32.615
Don't make me have
to tell you twice. Sit.

38:44.737 --> 38:47.729
Don't get any cute ideas either.

38:48.141 --> 38:49.733
The only reason l saved your life...

38:50.843 --> 38:54.301
...is because whatever is
in your blood can save mine.

38:54.480 --> 38:57.779
lf they corner us,
suffer no delusions...

38:57.950 --> 38:59.713
...l will kill you.

39:10.763 --> 39:12.492
<i>-S Squadron entering station.
-Damn it!</i>

39:12.665 --> 39:14.292
<i>Will detain and search train.</i>

39:14.467 --> 39:17.265
<i>Metro Five is boarding.</i>

39:28.047 --> 39:31.813
Just stick close.
l know somebody that can help.

39:44.897 --> 39:46.489
Hello?

39:48.768 --> 39:50.429
Hey, remember me?

39:50.670 --> 39:53.434
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

39:53.606 --> 39:57.508
These people will kill you
without even thinking.

39:57.677 --> 40:01.511
ln fact, they have thought about it, and
that's exactly what they intend to do.

40:01.681 --> 40:04.309
So l suggest you straighten up
before your actions...

40:04.483 --> 40:07.452
...start to impact my ability to survive.

40:17.230 --> 40:18.720
Look...

40:19.232 --> 40:21.530
...l'm just trying to do
what's good for you, okay?

40:21.868 --> 40:24.336
But you gotta stick by me.

40:25.338 --> 40:27.238
Stick by me.

40:40.953 --> 40:42.420
Garth, it's me.

40:42.588 --> 40:44.715
l screwed up.
l screwed up bad.

40:45.324 --> 40:47.554
The case had a kid in it.

40:47.894 --> 40:50.260
<i>-l crossed Nerva.
-I know. He called.</i>

40:50.429 --> 40:52.522
<i>Don't even think about
bringing it here, V.</i>

40:52.698 --> 40:54.825
Damn it, this kid might have
the answer in him.

40:55.001 --> 40:57.993
Now, l'm just gonna be lucky
to get him out of here alive.

41:00.673 --> 41:02.641
<i>-l need your help.
-I'm sorry, V.</i>

41:02.808 --> 41:06.676
<i>My research is too important
to jeopardize for a single child.</i>

41:07.079 --> 41:08.376
<i>Goodbye, V.</i>

41:20.960 --> 41:24.020
What part of those bullets whizzing
by your head didn't you get?

41:26.232 --> 41:29.395
Do you understand anything
l'm saying to you?

41:32.438 --> 41:36.169
Okay, let's start simple.

41:36.475 --> 41:39.467
They had to call you something, right?
You have a name?

41:39.645 --> 41:42.375
l'm Violet.
Hi, pleased to meet you.

41:42.548 --> 41:43.913
Your turn. Go.

41:57.163 --> 41:58.926
Six?

42:00.266 --> 42:01.995
You?

42:05.604 --> 42:06.901
We gotta go.

42:08.307 --> 42:09.774
Damn it.

42:14.680 --> 42:15.908
Give me your arm.

42:20.486 --> 42:22.647
Give me your arm.

42:23.689 --> 42:26.123
Now, you listen to me, Six,
or whatever your name is...

42:26.292 --> 42:28.886
...l might not be able to get you
where l want to go...

42:29.061 --> 42:30.619
...but l'll get your blood there.

42:30.796 --> 42:32.855
Give me your arm before
l take the whole thing.

42:34.567 --> 42:39.129
You think those people are bad?
Well, let me tell you something.

42:39.305 --> 42:43.503
The real monster you don't want
knocking down your door is me.

42:44.477 --> 42:46.604
lf l scream...

42:47.913 --> 42:49.881
...we'll both be dead.

43:03.729 --> 43:06.527
Daxus doesn't know
you can speak, does he?

43:09.969 --> 43:11.732
What do you know
about what's going on?

43:15.141 --> 43:17.336
There's a war going on
to the death...

43:17.510 --> 43:19.410
...between humans
and Hemophages.

43:19.578 --> 43:22.672
And, Six, you're a human.

43:24.350 --> 43:26.409
And l'm a Hemophage.

43:27.453 --> 43:28.681
Wait.

43:28.854 --> 43:30.321
Listen, do you remember l said...

43:30.489 --> 43:33.185
...there was something in
your blood that could save my life?

43:33.392 --> 43:36.418
Well, Daxus, he put something
into your blood.

43:36.595 --> 43:37.960
He grew something there.

43:38.130 --> 43:40.690
And whatever that is,
those antigens...

43:40.866 --> 43:42.857
...they may hold the key
to saving my life...

43:43.035 --> 43:46.198
...but they were put there
first and foremost to kill me.

43:46.372 --> 43:49.569
To kill me and everyone like me.

43:50.342 --> 43:53.175
So these men...?

43:53.979 --> 43:56.209
Yeah, Six.

43:56.582 --> 43:57.844
They're after you.

43:58.717 --> 44:03.347
Right now, you're the most
valuable object on this planet.

44:09.261 --> 44:10.523
Unbelievable, V.

44:10.696 --> 44:12.687
You jeopardize
everything by coming here.

44:13.165 --> 44:16.862
The humans want me.
Nerva wants me.

44:17.670 --> 44:20.434
l don't have any place
left to go, Garth.

44:21.974 --> 44:23.532
Besides...

44:24.743 --> 44:26.267
...you have all my guns.

44:29.482 --> 44:31.712
So, what's his story?

44:35.087 --> 44:36.577
You tell me.

45:00.846 --> 45:02.177
Can you make an assessment?

45:02.348 --> 45:05.749
l'll need to draw some blood.
lt'll take a few hours.

45:19.698 --> 45:22.428
<i>Sweeper Team A,
inform Archminister Daxus...</i>

45:22.601 --> 45:25.695
<i>...we have the remaining Hemophages
cornered on the 2 1 st floor.</i>

45:28.607 --> 45:30.734
-They're right behind me.
-The lights.

45:39.451 --> 45:42.352
Go night-vision. Take them apart.

45:45.791 --> 45:50.023
<i>Switching to emergency
backup lighting system.</i>

46:37.309 --> 46:38.936
So...

46:39.378 --> 46:41.278
...are you going to kill me?

46:49.521 --> 46:51.614
Think you can?

47:20.519 --> 47:25.115
l think you and l have matters
of mutual self-interest to discuss.

47:41.206 --> 47:42.867
Sit down.

47:49.381 --> 47:52.248
Humans are celebrating something.

48:07.433 --> 48:09.492
Where is this?

48:14.540 --> 48:16.508
When l was a kid...

48:17.042 --> 48:19.272
...when l was just a little girl...

48:20.312 --> 48:24.214
...l used to dream
about this old, dusty road.

48:25.584 --> 48:29.953
And this road would go on
as far as the eye could see.

48:31.557 --> 48:36.654
There was all these little white flowers
growing around the edges.

48:36.829 --> 48:40.265
And it was such a peaceful place.

48:42.134 --> 48:43.829
lt was a happy place.

48:44.937 --> 48:47.167
But then you realize...

48:47.339 --> 48:49.705
...when life settles in around you...

48:50.275 --> 48:54.041
...places like this don't exist.

49:03.455 --> 49:05.446
You're dying.

49:07.059 --> 49:09.254
Yeah.

49:09.428 --> 49:10.986
l am.

49:16.368 --> 49:17.596
l'm sorry.

49:23.709 --> 49:25.370
Do you read Thaihindi?

49:27.179 --> 49:30.307
All right. Look.

49:35.387 --> 49:37.480
''Comrade.''

49:40.292 --> 49:41.850
''Lover.''

49:45.697 --> 49:47.324
''Wife.''

49:49.868 --> 49:51.893
<i>And this one....</i>

49:52.070 --> 49:54.595
This one was
gonna say ''mother''...

49:54.773 --> 49:58.209
...but l got sick...

50:00.345 --> 50:02.779
...and all that
became impossible.

50:41.119 --> 50:43.610
You're not looking so good.

50:43.789 --> 50:45.484
l need to transfuse you.

50:45.657 --> 50:49.593
Just be thankful you didn't convert
with light sensitivity too.

50:58.237 --> 50:59.898
You do this?

51:01.874 --> 51:04.672
-What is it?
-l'm not sure.

51:04.843 --> 51:07.539
lt looks chemical...

51:07.713 --> 51:10.944
...but it seems to be done in the
pre-collapse form of Western notation.

51:11.149 --> 51:13.640
lt was probably him.

51:15.587 --> 51:16.849
What is he?

51:17.789 --> 51:19.313
l know what he's not.

51:20.959 --> 51:23.086
He's not someone who has
a single molecule...

51:23.262 --> 51:26.959
...of vampiral antigen in his blood.
That's what he's not.

51:27.132 --> 51:30.158
He's not someone
who's any good to us.

51:30.335 --> 51:33.270
We can't reverse-engineer
a cure out of his blood.

51:33.438 --> 51:36.305
-What?
-lf that's not bad enough, the kid's hot.

51:36.475 --> 51:38.033
Practically radioactive.

51:38.210 --> 51:41.805
He's got a tracking device in him
that's accurate to about 1 00 meters.

51:41.980 --> 51:44.039
We're shielded in here.

51:44.550 --> 51:46.677
l don't understand.

51:46.852 --> 51:49.377
Why would Nerva
want me to get him so badly?

51:49.555 --> 51:51.819
And why were the humans
guarding him so closely?

51:51.990 --> 51:53.753
l don't know.

51:55.093 --> 51:58.893
But whatever they did put in the kid,
Violet, it's killing him.

52:00.098 --> 52:02.123
Some kind of aggressive,
antagonistic protein.

52:02.301 --> 52:05.202
Very predictable decay.

52:05.370 --> 52:07.565
He's got a shelf life
of about eight hours.

52:10.509 --> 52:12.568
The kid's toast, V.

52:36.768 --> 52:39.396
Why are you doing this?
He's just a child.

52:39.571 --> 52:41.732
lt's a human child, Garth.

52:41.907 --> 52:45.206
And besides, what you're doing here
is too valuable to jeopardize.

52:46.778 --> 52:48.803
Goodbye, Garth.

52:51.516 --> 52:53.211
You've got a tracking device in you.

52:53.385 --> 52:57.082
We've got to get moving
before it locks on. Come on.

53:09.701 --> 53:13.762
Daxus. My phone number changes
every 60 seconds.

53:20.379 --> 53:23.712
<i>Disposable phone printing.
Thank you.</i>

53:28.720 --> 53:29.948
Garth, it's me.

53:30.122 --> 53:32.613
They've been tracking my phone.
You better get moving.

53:32.824 --> 53:35.452
-Okay.
-Violet.

53:36.128 --> 53:38.119
Maybe it's me.

53:40.098 --> 53:41.360
Come on.

53:49.641 --> 53:53.008
Violet, wait.
What are we doing?

53:57.115 --> 53:59.640
l would be neglecting my duties...

53:59.818 --> 54:01.945
...if l didn't get a growing boy fed,
wouldn't l?

54:03.855 --> 54:07.120
Credit card. All right,
so you take this over there...

54:07.292 --> 54:10.193
...and see if you can't find us
something to eat.

54:19.037 --> 54:20.629
Go on.

54:27.012 --> 54:28.912
Six.

54:30.549 --> 54:32.949
You should really...

54:35.187 --> 54:37.052
...put your mask up.

54:41.526 --> 54:42.515
Goodbye, Violet.

55:13.725 --> 55:16.091
-lt's urgent.
-Response team moving out.

55:16.495 --> 55:19.328
Alpha Squad, Alpha Squad.

55:32.544 --> 55:35.035
Alpha Squad, we have visual.

55:52.564 --> 55:53.792
<i>What am I doing?</i>

56:27.499 --> 56:28.966
lt's not him.

56:29.134 --> 56:33.093
<i>-Secure lockdown.
-Initiate area-quarantine procedures.</i>

56:46.017 --> 56:47.416
Six.

56:49.221 --> 56:50.711
Wait.

56:52.357 --> 56:53.381
Six!

56:53.558 --> 56:54.855
Sorry, V.

57:19.885 --> 57:22.718
Violet Song jat Shariff.

57:22.888 --> 57:24.879
What are you thinking?

57:25.056 --> 57:27.422
We're not Blood Chinois.

57:31.496 --> 57:36.695
We're as fast as you.
We're as strong as you.

57:36.868 --> 57:38.529
Yeah.

57:39.304 --> 57:41.169
But...

57:41.740 --> 57:44.641
...are you one-tenth
as pissed off as l am?

58:23.748 --> 58:24.976
Careful, V.

58:25.850 --> 58:29.479
Gunfire will attract
the human security teams.

58:29.654 --> 58:33.055
You might win the battle,
but you'd lose the war, V.

58:36.962 --> 58:38.793
V, wait.

58:42.300 --> 58:45.497
Don't you realize
what this child has in him?

58:45.670 --> 58:48.503
l don't care
what this child has in him.

58:48.673 --> 58:54.111
lt's not a vampiral antigen,
but a human antigen.

58:54.279 --> 58:57.510
Lethal enough to kill
every human on the planet.

58:59.784 --> 59:02.048
Why would humans create
a human antigen?

59:02.220 --> 59:05.383
What do l, or even you, care why?

59:05.557 --> 59:09.084
Daxus has offered us
a most tempting proposal.

59:09.260 --> 59:12.127
One that would finally
even the odds for us.

59:12.297 --> 59:14.197
So just walk away, V.

59:14.866 --> 59:17.460
Walk away.

59:53.705 --> 59:55.366
Are you insane?

59:55.540 --> 59:59.101
You won't drop him.
You need him more than l do.

01:00:00.311 --> 01:00:01.573
End her.

01:01:17.355 --> 01:01:20.813
What did they put in me, Violet?

01:01:30.602 --> 01:01:32.365
Don't you see?

01:01:33.538 --> 01:01:38.737
That mechanism Daxus,
your father, put inside you...

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:44.644
...it's an antagonistic protein.
lt's very precise.

01:01:47.685 --> 01:01:50.153
And it's gonna shut you down, Six.

01:01:52.056 --> 01:01:54.854
lt's gonna kill you, Six.

01:01:55.426 --> 01:01:57.291
<i>lf l don't find some way....</i>

01:01:57.462 --> 01:01:59.225
<i>lf l don't find some....</i>

01:01:59.397 --> 01:02:02.366
<i>l just need some time.
l just need....</i>

01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:11.668
<i>-Hello, Violet.
-3-D me.</i>

01:02:14.379 --> 01:02:15.676
This is a surprise.

01:02:15.847 --> 01:02:18.680
l want you to take out
whatever you put in the kid.

01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:22.342
Oh, l wish that was possible,
but there is no cure for the antigen.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.421
-l don't believe you.
-Just bring him to me.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.023
The antigen dies with the boy...

01:02:27.192 --> 01:02:29.660
...and neither of them are
any good to anybody.

01:02:29.827 --> 01:02:33.194
You said you were his father,
for God's sake.

01:02:33.364 --> 01:02:35.229
No, Violet.

01:02:37.001 --> 01:02:38.491
l don't have a father.

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:41.270
No, more precisely...

01:02:44.642 --> 01:02:45.904
...he's my clone.

01:02:46.077 --> 01:02:47.806
Number six in a series of eight.

01:02:48.913 --> 01:02:52.371
What the hell difference does it make?
He's a child, you monster.

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:54.074
Monster?

01:02:54.252 --> 01:02:56.186
And what are you?

01:02:56.354 --> 01:02:58.948
And more importantly,
what does that make him to you?

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:03.822
Some sort of bizarre,
maternal surrogate?

01:03:05.063 --> 01:03:08.999
A vampire and a dying human child.

01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:11.567
What a pathetic picture.

01:03:11.736 --> 01:03:15.502
l'll make you another, Violet.
One that's not broken.

01:03:15.673 --> 01:03:18.233
You won't even be able
to tell the difference. l promise.

01:03:18.409 --> 01:03:22.436
And l may even be able to help you
with that problem in your own blood.

01:03:23.081 --> 01:03:24.844
-Trace.
-Why track the call?

01:03:25.016 --> 01:03:28.747
l'll tell you where l am.
l want you to bring me the boy.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.753
l'll bring you a lot more than that,
you prick.

01:03:32.957 --> 01:03:35.721
l have 700 soldiers here with me.

01:03:35.893 --> 01:03:39.624
What do you really think
you could do against that many men?

01:03:41.366 --> 01:03:43.334
l can kill them.

01:03:48.006 --> 01:03:51.100
Archministry.
Let's go meet your maker.

01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:01.143
<i>Auto-guide on.</i>

01:04:11.095 --> 01:04:12.494
You can't make it in.

01:04:13.631 --> 01:04:16.293
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

01:04:18.536 --> 01:04:21.164
Haven't you been paying attention?

01:04:21.806 --> 01:04:24.138
Killing is what l do.

01:04:24.709 --> 01:04:26.677
lt's what l'm good at.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:32.581
l am a titan.

01:04:33.718 --> 01:04:35.845
A monolith.

01:04:37.689 --> 01:04:39.384
Nothing can stop me.

01:04:42.126 --> 01:04:43.354
l can see it.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.364
What the hell choice do l have?

01:04:49.167 --> 01:04:50.794
A very clear one.

01:04:53.037 --> 01:04:54.299
To watch me die.

01:04:56.174 --> 01:04:58.199
Or make me...

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:00.402
...watch you do the same.

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.534
-Are you mental?
-The antidote.

01:05:33.177 --> 01:05:36.078
l told you, there is no cure.

01:05:36.247 --> 01:05:38.647
You wouldn't create an antigen
without an antidote...

01:05:38.816 --> 01:05:41.341
...you could administer to yourself
and your manciples.

01:05:42.653 --> 01:05:44.814
Very nice, Violet.

01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:46.616
Well, yes, there is an antidote.

01:05:46.791 --> 01:05:48.224
And, yes, when l get the boy...

01:05:48.393 --> 01:05:51.157
...l isolate the antigen
and release it into the atmosphere.

01:05:51.329 --> 01:05:55.129
Anyone who wants to live will
queue up daily at this door to get it.

01:05:55.299 --> 01:05:57.563
l thought we were
the ones you hated.

01:05:57.735 --> 01:06:00.169
l thought we were the ones
you were trying to wipe out.

01:06:00.338 --> 01:06:03.273
That's the problem.
You were. Past tense.

01:06:03.441 --> 01:06:06.808
But now that you and those like you
are all but extinct...

01:06:06.978 --> 01:06:09.378
...what's someone like me--
Someone with a job to do.

01:06:09.547 --> 01:06:11.742
--going to use
to keep order in a society...

01:06:11.916 --> 01:06:15.647
...that, left to itself, would sprint
toward chaos like an Olympic event?

01:06:16.521 --> 01:06:17.749
We did our job too well.

01:06:18.623 --> 01:06:21.285
Now, must we make amends.

01:06:21.692 --> 01:06:23.683
You disgust me.

01:06:24.095 --> 01:06:28.156
lt's a relative term, Violet.
Give me what l want.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.797
Come and get it.

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:47.779
You won't have him.

01:06:55.993 --> 01:06:57.858
<i>Projection disruption.</i>

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:14.171
There's just too many, V.

01:07:16.848 --> 01:07:18.816
Just too many.

01:08:02.126 --> 01:08:03.593
Six.

01:08:06.497 --> 01:08:08.556
-Violet.
-l'm here. l'm here.

01:08:15.139 --> 01:08:17.470
What's that sound, V?

01:08:18.509 --> 01:08:20.943
V, what's that sound?

01:08:22.913 --> 01:08:24.848
lt's just the wind.

01:08:26.584 --> 01:08:28.551
lt's just the wind.

01:09:04.589 --> 01:09:05.953
Too late. He's gone.

01:09:06.122 --> 01:09:08.353
Quarantine the corpse.
Get it to the Archministry.

01:09:08.693 --> 01:09:10.627
Maybe we can salvage
something out of it.

01:09:10.795 --> 01:09:12.819
And her, sir?

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.015
Have an incendiary team sanitize
the area immediately.

01:09:33.584 --> 01:09:36.178
<i>-All personnel, clear the area.
-Get the body on ice.</i>

01:09:36.354 --> 01:09:38.082
Prepare it for disassembly.

01:09:38.255 --> 01:09:40.951
-We'll go in for salvage at daybreak.
-Yes, doctor.

01:09:41.125 --> 01:09:44.822
<i>All personnel,
clear the area immediately.</i>

01:09:45.062 --> 01:09:46.689
Violet.

01:09:48.698 --> 01:09:50.325
Violet.

01:09:51.968 --> 01:09:53.492
Violet.

01:09:57.673 --> 01:09:59.265
Violet.

01:10:04.714 --> 01:10:05.840
Garth?

01:10:06.716 --> 01:10:09.651
We very thoughtfully subbed in
for the incendiary team.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.510
Your heart stopped three times...

01:10:12.688 --> 01:10:16.715
...but after four hours of surgery
and a lot of prayer...

01:10:16.893 --> 01:10:18.588
...we managed to save your life.

01:10:20.463 --> 01:10:22.192
You what?

01:10:27.403 --> 01:10:28.631
Careful.

01:10:31.474 --> 01:10:34.932
l was there, Garth. l was there.

01:10:36.379 --> 01:10:38.711
You brought me back?

01:10:39.248 --> 01:10:41.216
For what?

01:10:41.384 --> 01:10:44.547
So l could do it all over again?

01:10:45.655 --> 01:10:48.556
Why? Why?

01:10:49.525 --> 01:10:51.288
lsn't it...?

01:10:52.495 --> 01:10:54.690
lsn't it obvious?

01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:06.072
Why won't you ever let anyone in?

01:11:08.044 --> 01:11:09.807
Because...

01:11:12.415 --> 01:11:14.349
...these moments...

01:11:15.851 --> 01:11:18.217
...as beautiful as they are...

01:11:19.589 --> 01:11:21.648
...they're evil when they're gone.

01:12:26.989 --> 01:12:28.923
Has the third act begun yet?

01:12:31.027 --> 01:12:33.257
lt's just about to.

01:12:36.132 --> 01:12:38.362
lt's just about to.

01:13:29.518 --> 01:13:31.918
<i>Violet. It's me, Garth.</i>

01:13:32.088 --> 01:13:34.955
<i>Listen, turn on the TV.</i>

01:13:35.124 --> 01:13:37.957
<i>You're all over the place.
Every channel.</i>

01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:40.660
<i>-Just minutes ago--
-Listen to me.</i>

01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:42.491
<i>I know you're in a bad place.</i>

01:13:42.665 --> 01:13:46.624
<i>But what the boy wrote down
on that piece of paper...</i>

01:13:46.802 --> 01:13:49.168
<i>...it has something to do
with the HGV virus.</i>

01:13:49.338 --> 01:13:51.966
<i>I know it. I can feel it.</i>

01:13:52.141 --> 01:13:55.133
<i>Violet, if you could just give me
a little more time.</i>

01:13:56.312 --> 01:13:58.678
<i>V, are you listening?</i>

01:14:00.716 --> 01:14:03.776
<i>A number of helicopters
were also spotted at the scene--</i>

01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:09.685
<i>-Where are you?
-Outer 1 0th Artery. Westbound.</i>

01:14:09.859 --> 01:14:12.692
Stay on course. l'll converge in 1 5.

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:35.641
<i>Archministry on approach.</i>

01:14:35.818 --> 01:14:37.683
You can't get in there.
lt's impossible.

01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:40.481
Why do you think we had you
intercept the case...

01:14:40.656 --> 01:14:43.819
-...before it got back to Archministry?
-l'm aware of that.

01:14:46.028 --> 01:14:47.825
What's the point? Retribution?

01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:51.229
-The boy is dead.
-He's not dead.

01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:54.428
<i>-What do you mean?
-Weapons capacity reached.</i>

01:14:54.603 --> 01:14:57.003
l mean Six is alive.

01:14:57.173 --> 01:14:59.937
Violet, how can he be alive?

01:15:00.109 --> 01:15:02.100
Look, what the boy
wrote down on the paper...

01:15:02.278 --> 01:15:04.678
...it's the chemical foundation
of what l'm certain...

01:15:04.847 --> 01:15:06.508
...is a cure for hemoglophagia.

01:15:06.682 --> 01:15:08.582
Daxus' researchers probably
developed it...

01:15:08.751 --> 01:15:10.912
...in the same lab
that he was bred in.

01:15:11.086 --> 01:15:13.884
Just give me a little time.
l can cure you.

01:15:14.857 --> 01:15:16.085
l know it.

01:15:53.996 --> 01:15:57.454
The antigen can't survive
without a living host.

01:15:57.633 --> 01:16:02.400
However, we may be able to salvage
some viable basic protein analogs...

01:16:02.571 --> 01:16:08.874
...that will save us time in re-culturing
the antigen in another clone.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.262
<i>Searching for concealed weapons.</i>

01:16:33.102 --> 01:16:37.971
<i>Number of weapons found: many.</i>

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.768
l'm here to see the vice-cardinal.

01:16:44.613 --> 01:16:46.171
<i>Yellow alert! Yellow alert!</i>

01:16:46.215 --> 01:16:47.705
<i>Yellow alert! Yellow alert!</i>

01:16:47.883 --> 01:16:51.819
<i>Yellow alert! Yellow alert!
Yellow alert!</i>

01:16:51.987 --> 01:16:55.650
-lt's-- lt's her.
-She's dead.

01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:03.128
Oh, my God.

01:17:06.702 --> 01:17:11.969
<i>Single female intruder identified
at Security Portal One.</i>

01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:14.234
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:19.074
<i>Pacification and neutralization
is underway.</i>

01:17:25.387 --> 01:17:27.981
The boy's dead.
This is pure suicide.

01:18:47.136 --> 01:18:50.503
<i>Yellow alert upgraded.
Orange alert.</i>

01:18:50.673 --> 01:18:53.506
One woman against 1 4 men?
lt's ridiculous.

01:18:53.676 --> 01:18:56.076
Have the Gas Guard waiting
for her in the library.

01:18:56.245 --> 01:18:58.145
<i>-l'm going to level her.
-Orange alert.</i>

01:20:30.939 --> 01:20:33.669
How much weaponry
does she have left?

01:20:33.842 --> 01:20:37.539
Based on the scans taken
from the security portal...

01:20:37.713 --> 01:20:39.237
...plenty.

01:20:42.384 --> 01:20:43.373
Okay.

01:21:15.984 --> 01:21:18.646
<i>Red alert. Red alert.</i>

01:21:19.321 --> 01:21:21.721
<i>Red alert. Red alert.</i>

01:22:37.132 --> 01:22:40.431
You are all gonna die.

01:23:01.556 --> 01:23:03.581
ls that all you've got?

01:23:10.132 --> 01:23:13.329
Violet, the boy is dead.

01:23:13.502 --> 01:23:17.836
You obviously don't have
a clear grasp of what dead really is.

01:23:18.006 --> 01:23:19.769
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:23:20.475 --> 01:23:23.774
For God's sakes.
Violet, l'm unarmed.

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.240
Not yet, you're not.

01:23:33.689 --> 01:23:35.088
No.

01:23:49.137 --> 01:23:50.832
You got Hemo blood on me.

01:24:00.983 --> 01:24:02.473
lt is on.

01:24:30.245 --> 01:24:31.576
Yeah, it is.

01:24:58.407 --> 01:25:01.274
Yes, no doubt, in a fair fight
you would beat me.

01:25:03.512 --> 01:25:06.379
But that's not how l got
where l am today.

01:25:19.528 --> 01:25:21.587
Can you see me, Violet?

01:25:23.765 --> 01:25:24.993
No?

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:28.830
Too bad you converted with
only mild light sensitivity.

01:25:29.004 --> 01:25:30.869
Unlike me.

01:25:31.039 --> 01:25:33.837
-What?
-That's right, Violet.

01:25:34.009 --> 01:25:36.204
<i>How do you think
a lowly lab technician...</i>

01:25:36.378 --> 01:25:39.108
<i>...made that meteoric rise
through the ranks?</i>

01:25:39.281 --> 01:25:40.714
<i>What accident of providence...</i>

01:25:40.882 --> 01:25:44.613
<i>...do you think gave him
those additional qualities?</i>

01:25:44.786 --> 01:25:46.981
<i>Yes, Violet...</i>

01:25:47.155 --> 01:25:49.521
<i>...I'm like you.</i>

01:25:50.325 --> 01:25:51.815
My God.

01:25:51.993 --> 01:25:57.260
With the minor exception that
l'm going to walk out of here alive.

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.097
Violet?

01:26:01.036 --> 01:26:02.367
Violet.

01:26:54.723 --> 01:26:57.283
Do you believe in God, Violet?

01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.694
Do you hope he's merciful?

01:27:00.862 --> 01:27:03.558
Do you think he'll welcome you
into his arms...

01:27:03.732 --> 01:27:07.998
...like the so very many you've
sent his way?

01:27:08.170 --> 01:27:09.899
Hey, Daxus.

01:27:12.374 --> 01:27:14.808
You know, after this,
l think he will.

01:28:00.422 --> 01:28:02.253
Six.

01:28:03.592 --> 01:28:05.617
Six, wake up.

01:28:06.628 --> 01:28:07.686
Violet?

01:28:10.031 --> 01:28:11.692
But...

01:28:11.866 --> 01:28:14.926
...l thought l was dead.

01:28:16.204 --> 01:28:17.193
No.

01:28:36.157 --> 01:28:38.091
You've just been reborn.

01:28:46.167 --> 01:28:47.395
Violet?

01:28:49.871 --> 01:28:51.771
Violet.

01:28:52.507 --> 01:28:54.372
Violet.

01:28:57.078 --> 01:29:00.172
-lt's okay.
-No, it's not.

01:29:00.348 --> 01:29:03.317
Violet, listen to me.

01:29:04.786 --> 01:29:06.151
There's a cure.

01:29:07.756 --> 01:29:09.121
l know.

01:29:13.795 --> 01:29:15.660
l've found it.

01:29:23.238 --> 01:29:25.103
Come on.

01:29:33.848 --> 01:29:38.808
<i>Yes, I was born into a world
you might not understand...</i>

01:29:38.987 --> 01:29:41.581
<i>...but a world, as it turns out...</i>

01:29:41.756 --> 01:29:45.192
<i>...where hope still lives.</i>

01:29:47.762 --> 01:29:50.094
<i>And my body?</i>

01:29:50.265 --> 01:29:52.426
<i>Would Garth be able to fix it...</i>

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.592
<i>...the way another
had cured my soul?</i>

01:29:56.338 --> 01:29:59.865
<i>Maybe, maybe not.</i>

01:30:00.041 --> 01:30:02.032
<i>But this I do know:</i>

01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:05.805
<i>All those still out there
who spread oppression...</i>

01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:09.711
<i>...injustice and hatred...</i>

01:30:09.884 --> 01:30:11.647
<i>...they better hope not.</i>

01:33:12.648 --> 01:34:25.248
