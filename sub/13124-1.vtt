00:27.911 --> 00:32.753
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:32.826 --> 00:34.553
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:36.462 --> 00:38.396
[Thaddeus] <i>Tonight, so-called
magician Lionel Shrike</i>

00:38.420 --> 00:40.898
<i>is making another sad
attempt for attention</i>

00:41.017 --> 00:44.336
<i>by performing what he calls
an impossible feat.</i>

00:44.414 --> 00:47.813
<i>The safe is made of
the strongest iron.</i>

00:47.891 --> 00:51.016
<i>It can't be sawed through or pried.</i>

00:51.087 --> 00:55.372
<i>Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks
he's able to escape.</i>

00:55.443 --> 00:57.284
Dad! Dad!

00:58.800 --> 01:02.118
Hey, buddy.
You made it, huh?

01:02.196 --> 01:05.595
Now, see that seat there?

01:05.673 --> 01:07.161
It's the best
seat in the house.

01:07.231 --> 01:11.471
Is Lionel Shrike the kind
of magician who can pull this off?

01:11.547 --> 01:14.434
<i>Or is he actually
in over his head?</i>

01:14.504 --> 01:16.106
We'll see about that.

01:16.182 --> 01:18.501
- What's the matter?
- I don't want you to go.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.740
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

01:20.818 --> 01:23.136
Remember?
This is what I do.

01:23.215 --> 01:25.693
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

01:25.773 --> 01:28.580
Okay? Besides...

01:28.650 --> 01:31.730
[whispers] I always keep
something up my sleeve.

01:31.807 --> 01:33.887
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

01:34.644 --> 01:37.406
- Okay. How many seconds?
- Three hundred.

01:37.481 --> 01:40.163
Three hundred. Maybe a few less.

01:42.076 --> 01:45.395
Mmm.
I love you so much.

01:47.191 --> 01:50.078
[whispers]
Okay. See you later, big man.

01:50.148 --> 01:54.786
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
Lionel Shrike!

01:54.864 --> 01:56.307
[crowd cheering]

01:56.382 --> 01:58.348
[Thaddeus] Will he be able
to hold his breath?

01:58.420 --> 02:02.102
Will he be able to
somehow escape the safe?

02:05.493 --> 02:07.891
[crowd] Three, two, one...

02:10.648 --> 02:12.535
[crowd cheering]

02:13.285 --> 02:14.729
Two, three,

02:14.804 --> 02:19.361
four, five, six,
seven, eight...

02:20.238 --> 02:27.240
296... 297, 298, 299, 300.

02:30.708 --> 02:33.470
303, 304...

02:34.584 --> 02:36.232
[Thaddeus]
<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

02:37.221 --> 02:41.666
<i>and we have not seen or heard
anything from Lionel Shrike yet.</i>

02:41.737 --> 02:42.896
Move!

02:42.975 --> 02:44.180
[crowd murmuring]

02:44.254 --> 02:45.334
Dad!

02:45.413 --> 02:46.538
[ambulance siren wailing]

02:46.612 --> 02:49.089
Dad! Dad!

02:51.047 --> 02:52.411
Let go of me!

02:53.245 --> 02:54.405
Dad!

02:55.723 --> 02:57.564
[Sobs] No! Dad!

02:58.680 --> 03:00.726
Dad! Let go!

03:01.876 --> 03:03.081
Find him!

03:04.953 --> 03:06.238
[inaudible]

03:23.255 --> 03:24.460
[Thaddeus] <i>The Eye.</i>

03:25.253 --> 03:27.174
<i>It may not lie...</i>

03:27.251 --> 03:30.775
<i>But don't think for a moment
that it can't be lied to.</i>

03:32.526 --> 03:35.367
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

03:35.443 --> 03:37.364
<i>But is it truth?</i>

03:37.441 --> 03:41.919
<i>People see the Horsemen
as noble Robin Hoods. Are they?</i>

03:41.996 --> 03:45.156
<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

03:45.233 --> 03:47.074
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

03:47.790 --> 03:49.314
<i>Here's what you know.</i>

03:49.389 --> 03:52.946
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris
from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

03:53.025 --> 03:54.674
<i>They fleeced
an insurance magnate</i>

03:54.744 --> 03:56.312
<i>of hundreds of
millions of dollars</i>

03:56.382 --> 03:59.030
<i>and disappeared from
a roof in New York.</i>

03:59.099 --> 04:03.339
<i>Always showering their
devoted fans with money.</i>

04:03.415 --> 04:05.302
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

04:05.373 --> 04:07.499
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

04:07.571 --> 04:11.014
<i>Framed. Holding the bag. Me.</i>

04:12.606 --> 04:14.970
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

04:15.043 --> 04:18.202
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

04:19.279 --> 04:22.325
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

04:22.436 --> 04:27.642
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you.</i>

04:27.711 --> 04:30.075
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

04:30.907 --> 04:33.067
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

04:33.185 --> 04:39.982
<i>Because one thing I believe in
is an eye for an eye.</i>

05:08.590 --> 05:09.953
[exhales]

05:55.742 --> 05:57.266
[door locks]

05:57.341 --> 05:59.182
[man] <i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

06:00.298 --> 06:01.583
Who am I speaking to?

06:03.015 --> 06:05.061
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

06:06.012 --> 06:10.411
<i>You've asked many questions.
And registered many complaints.</i>

06:10.488 --> 06:12.409
<i>You can rest assured
that we've heard you.</i>

06:12.486 --> 06:14.060
- Have you? Because I don't...
- [whispering voices]

06:14.084 --> 06:15.414
<i>- Trust?</i>
- No.

06:15.483 --> 06:18.211
<i>Your leader?
Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

06:18.280 --> 06:19.768
<i>Perhaps even us?</i>

06:19.838 --> 06:23.805
I don't like that we've been
living in hiding for a year.

06:23.874 --> 06:26.079
I don't like that every message
I get from Dylan is,

06:26.152 --> 06:28.800
"Wait. Be patient.
The Eye has a plan."

06:28.869 --> 06:31.268
- <i>Wait. Be patient.</i>
- [chuckles dryly]

06:31.347 --> 06:32.552
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

06:32.625 --> 06:35.593
This is games
and it's not working for me.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.186
[whispering voices continue]

06:37.261 --> 06:40.580
<i>You feel it is you who should be
leading the Horsemen, not Dylan.</i>

06:42.416 --> 06:46.133
<i>If that is what you desire,
stay the course.</i>

06:46.212 --> 06:48.212
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

06:48.290 --> 06:52.086
<i>and remarkable mind
will not go unrecognized.</i>

06:52.166 --> 06:54.769
<i>We have a new mission
for the Horsemen.</i>

06:54.843 --> 06:57.923
<i>Dylan has a plan
and will gather you together soon.</i>

06:59.159 --> 07:00.807
[voices] <i>Now leave!</i>

07:07.590 --> 07:09.079
[phone ringing]

07:11.586 --> 07:14.712
[indistinct chatter]

07:14.783 --> 07:17.590
[Austin] ...North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.548
We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.

07:19.618 --> 07:21.540
I need to see some results.

07:21.616 --> 07:23.424
Oh, hey. Oh, sorry.

07:23.495 --> 07:25.588
Just real quick. Can I have you
for a couple of minutes?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.307
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

07:27.331 --> 07:29.744
No, I know. It's okay. Hey. Hey,
everybody. Sorry. Sorry about that.

07:29.768 --> 07:32.337
[sighs]
Call the mayor.

07:32.406 --> 07:34.804
Thanks a lot.
Twins, huh? Good.

07:35.642 --> 07:37.052
Is he coming?

07:37.121 --> 07:39.201
Look, I wouldn't have
brought you out of that meeting

07:39.279 --> 07:40.767
unless it was something important.

07:40.837 --> 07:43.202
It's about the Horsemen.

07:43.275 --> 07:46.435
Somethings happening here
and it's happening now.

07:46.512 --> 07:49.194
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

07:49.309 --> 07:51.707
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

07:51.786 --> 07:55.026
and something happening with Octa,
the giant software company.

07:55.143 --> 07:56.143
I know what Octa is.

07:56.222 --> 07:57.870
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

07:57.940 --> 07:59.906
we sent men to Philadelphia
because he knew...

08:00.018 --> 08:02.303
- And I said that I was wrong.
- He knew that the Horsemen

08:02.376 --> 08:04.030
were going to hit
the Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

08:04.054 --> 08:05.109
- I have proof.
- Let him talk.

08:05.133 --> 08:07.338
Thank you.
Communications.

08:07.411 --> 08:11.412
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

08:11.487 --> 08:14.169
and who may be Merritt McKinney.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.608
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones? Any transcripts?

08:17.680 --> 08:19.840
- Pigeons.
- What?

08:19.918 --> 08:22.203
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

08:22.276 --> 08:24.924
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons.
Like carrier pigeons.

08:24.993 --> 08:27.960
- Okay? Magicians work with pigeons.
- Doves.

08:29.149 --> 08:30.479
Stay with me.

08:31.586 --> 08:33.746
This pigeon, right here...

08:33.823 --> 08:36.428
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

08:36.501 --> 08:37.581
East Village.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.263
Same pigeon, West Village.

08:39.339 --> 08:42.101
42nd Street, pigeon. 65th Street.

08:42.176 --> 08:45.063
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

08:45.133 --> 08:49.736
on a sail boat with a guy that looks
just like Merritt McKinney.

08:49.808 --> 08:51.218
And what does this all mean?

08:51.287 --> 08:53.730
I know what it means.
It means nothing. It's bullshit.

08:53.804 --> 08:55.486
- Could you sing a new song?
- No.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.602
How is it that two years ago
you were so close...

08:57.680 --> 09:00.334
[Dylan] You think I went out of my way
to screw up my own investigation?

09:00.358 --> 09:01.612
You think I'm
that big of an idiot?

09:01.636 --> 09:03.171
You know what I think now?
I think you're smart,

09:03.195 --> 09:04.450
but you want everybody else
to think that you're an idiot.

09:04.473 --> 09:06.440
[Austin] Okay, stop.

09:06.511 --> 09:09.557
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

09:09.628 --> 09:11.867
people who don't even know you,
think you're an asshole.

09:12.865 --> 09:14.275
- And you?
- Ma'am.

09:14.344 --> 09:18.265
You don't know me, but my first year
in the Academy, you gave a talk.

09:18.340 --> 09:22.738
The "long game" you called it.
You talked about a moral compass.

09:22.815 --> 09:25.020
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

09:26.851 --> 09:32.171
And I thought to myself, "That guy.
One day, I want to be that guy."

09:33.804 --> 09:36.328
And now... A pigeon?

09:36.402 --> 09:38.655
Technically, it was a few pigeons,
but I hear what you're saying.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.254
[sighs] Okay. So here's what
I'm going to do.

09:40.278 --> 09:43.279
You want to take a vacation day?
Go on your own? Fine.

09:43.395 --> 09:46.679
But I'm not going to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

09:46.751 --> 09:49.877
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

09:49.948 --> 09:53.426
Boss, thank you. I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

09:53.504 --> 09:55.550
We're gonna get those Horsemen.

09:55.942 --> 09:57.067
She's great.

09:57.141 --> 10:00.301
The problem is when you're
two people at the same time,

10:00.378 --> 10:01.896
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

10:01.936 --> 10:05.142
And when that happens,
I will be there.

10:05.732 --> 10:06.971
Duly noted.

10:17.281 --> 10:18.724
[door closes]

10:21.237 --> 10:23.283
[clattering]

10:28.389 --> 10:29.958
- Oh. Hi!
- Who are you?

10:30.028 --> 10:31.762
- What are you doing in my...
- It's actually a funny story.

10:31.786 --> 10:33.388
How did you get into my apartment?
Whoa!

10:33.464 --> 10:35.749
[girl] I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "ha ha."

10:35.822 --> 10:37.948
Or you might not think
that it's funny "ha ha."

10:38.060 --> 10:40.299
I think it's funny.
I guess it's all kind of relative.

10:40.377 --> 10:42.299
I was actually...
No, that's not...

10:42.375 --> 10:45.933
I made myself in the neighborhood
and now I'm here, and maybe...

10:46.012 --> 10:47.172
[music playing on radio]

10:48.849 --> 10:49.929
Okay.

10:50.008 --> 10:51.263
Seriously, how did you get in here?

10:51.287 --> 10:53.685
Are you some kind of
crazed fan or something?

10:53.764 --> 10:55.685
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I recognize you.

10:55.762 --> 10:58.922
You did that B-grade "geek magic" thing,
didn't you? You pulled a...

10:58.999 --> 11:00.254
[girl] Pulled a hat
out of the rabbit.

11:00.278 --> 11:01.572
A hat out of the rabbit, that's right.

11:01.596 --> 11:02.731
[girl] I know that it didn't work.

11:02.755 --> 11:03.890
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.408
[girl]
It was way worse for the rabbit.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.831
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

11:08.909 --> 11:12.274
So if you wouldn't mind crawling out
from under my couch and...

11:12.345 --> 11:13.755
[slurping]

11:15.143 --> 11:18.541
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

11:18.619 --> 11:22.302
By the way, that rabbit thing?
That was eight years ago, okay?

11:22.375 --> 11:24.058
I've gotten so much
better since then.

11:24.134 --> 11:25.463
- Have you?
- Yeah.

11:25.532 --> 11:27.107
Okay, come here.
What is it that you want?

11:27.131 --> 11:28.779
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

11:28.849 --> 11:30.451
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

11:30.527 --> 11:33.210
I said it. I do.
And I want to use my magic for good,

11:33.285 --> 11:36.967
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.095
[whispers] Oh, that's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

11:39.119 --> 11:40.453
I know that he
faked his own death.

11:40.477 --> 11:43.318
I am a huge fan of faking deaths.
That was crazy!

11:43.434 --> 11:44.958
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

11:45.033 --> 11:46.795
- Yeah.
- It's terrible.

11:46.871 --> 11:48.951
- Embarrassing.
- Okay.

11:49.029 --> 11:51.996
By the way, I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

11:52.066 --> 11:53.873
- Ow! God!
- [Atlas] Sorry.

11:53.944 --> 11:56.547
That's actually a little better.
You know what I heard?

11:56.621 --> 11:57.746
- What?
- About Henley?

11:57.820 --> 12:00.343
I heard that she got tired
of waiting around.

12:00.417 --> 12:02.941
She lost faith
and so she asked for an out,

12:03.015 --> 12:04.902
and the Eye gave it to her.

12:04.973 --> 12:06.212
But who knows, right?

12:06.291 --> 12:08.258
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

12:08.329 --> 12:10.807
I mean, maybe she got sick of you.
You ever think about that?

12:10.887 --> 12:12.217
Control issues?

12:12.285 --> 12:14.100
Maybe you just didn't
tie her up tight enough. Ow!

12:14.124 --> 12:15.487
Mmm.
Here's what's going to happen.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.887
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

12:17.960 --> 12:19.403
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

12:19.518 --> 12:21.837
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

12:23.754 --> 12:25.039
[cell phone vibrating]

12:28.389 --> 12:30.515
- [Jack] It's all in the wrist.
- [Merritt] Uh-huh.

12:30.587 --> 12:33.633
[Jack] Let the momentum
of the card do the work for you.

12:33.704 --> 12:34.829
[Merritt] Mmm-hmm.

12:34.903 --> 12:36.710
This last one I call the Stall.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.107
[whistles] Not bad.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.745
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

12:42.815 --> 12:44.542
- I do indeed.
- Here you go.

12:44.613 --> 12:46.852
And bingo bango bongo.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.537
That's good. No, no, no,
it's good to be positive

12:51.606 --> 12:53.130
despite making zero
progress in a year.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.250
Yeah.

12:54.323 --> 12:56.244
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

12:56.321 --> 12:58.765
the student has almost
become the master.

12:58.839 --> 13:03.442
I like your confidence, but you might
say that you have the better teacher.

13:03.514 --> 13:04.594
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

13:04.673 --> 13:05.878
You're right.
You're right.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.191
Your teacher definitely doesn't
know what he's doing.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.230
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

13:10.307 --> 13:12.672
- In fact it was.
- I thought so.

13:12.745 --> 13:14.343
- That's not bad.
- [vehicle approaching]

13:19.418 --> 13:21.783
If I can hypnotize Danny
before you hit him with a card,

13:21.856 --> 13:23.186
I get top bunk for a week.

13:23.254 --> 13:25.176
Okay, that's a deal.

13:25.252 --> 13:26.662
- Danny, what's up, man?
- Hey.

13:26.731 --> 13:28.785
Stare at the palm of your hand
and as your eyes change focus,

13:28.809 --> 13:30.139
you will begin to notice...

13:30.207 --> 13:31.262
Everything, because
I'm not hypnotized.

13:31.286 --> 13:34.332
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

13:34.403 --> 13:36.086
I didn't know you guys did party tricks

13:36.162 --> 13:37.896
when there weren't floozies around
to impress.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.159
Uh, I think we stopped
trying to impress floozies

13:40.237 --> 13:42.363
- in, like, 1937.
- [laughing]

13:42.475 --> 13:44.521
Okay, somebody broke into my apartment,
all right?

13:44.593 --> 13:46.355
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

13:46.431 --> 13:48.955
everything about Henley leaving,
and everything about us.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.711
- That's her.
- Hey!

13:51.786 --> 13:54.025
- Hi.
- You met Lula.

13:54.144 --> 13:56.621
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

13:56.701 --> 14:01.782
I'm the new Horseman!
I'm the girl Horseman.

14:01.856 --> 14:03.379
Whoo!

14:03.454 --> 14:04.534
Yeah!

14:05.652 --> 14:08.175
Nobody. No excitement.
Jack? Anything?

14:08.249 --> 14:10.215
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

14:10.287 --> 14:14.891
Well, Lula's been on the underground
scene for the last decade,

14:14.963 --> 14:16.611
and I think she
has some real talent,

14:16.681 --> 14:18.681
and I'd like to try her on stage

14:18.759 --> 14:20.885
- to balance out the duo.
- What?

14:20.957 --> 14:22.286
No, are you serious, man?

14:22.355 --> 14:24.409
After Henley left, you said I could
get back on stage again.

14:24.433 --> 14:25.843
Not someone who just showed up.

14:25.912 --> 14:27.753
I told you I'd think about it,
and I have,

14:27.830 --> 14:30.084
and I really need you behind the scenes
with me for a little while longer.

14:30.108 --> 14:32.361
Dylan, come on. I've been
behind the scenes my whole life.

14:32.385 --> 14:36.147
Which is a crime, might I add.
Have you seen that man's face?

14:36.221 --> 14:40.018
Much as I appreciate the addition
of some femininity to the group,

14:40.098 --> 14:42.336
over and above what Atlas provides,

14:42.415 --> 14:44.734
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

14:44.853 --> 14:47.171
Yeah, the issue is that
we have been rehearsing for months

14:47.250 --> 14:49.933
for something...
We don't even know what it is.

14:50.008 --> 14:51.422
And you're going to
keep working until...

14:51.446 --> 14:53.460
Until we work as a single organism.
I know, I've heard you say that.

14:53.484 --> 14:54.739
The thing is, when you say that,

14:54.763 --> 14:57.240
I think what you're
referring to is us, not you.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.719
Listen, I'm getting my orders
directly from the Eye.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.241
Okay? And then I give them to you.

15:01.316 --> 15:02.891
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

15:02.915 --> 15:05.673
No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm...
Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.

15:05.712 --> 15:07.087
[Lula] Guys, can I just
weigh in here really quickly?

15:07.110 --> 15:08.645
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

15:08.669 --> 15:11.510
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

15:11.586 --> 15:13.905
- I'm a new person...
- We are anything but a family.

15:13.984 --> 15:18.030
Okay, well, my mother literally
knifed my father in the neck one time.

15:18.099 --> 15:20.113
So you are actually
a little bit like my family unit.

15:20.137 --> 15:21.376
- Literally?
- But, yeah.

15:21.456 --> 15:23.377
It was an accident,
I think.

15:23.454 --> 15:26.500
Okay. So, does this mean
we're actually going to do something?

15:26.571 --> 15:28.651
Yes.

15:28.769 --> 15:33.167
You've all heard of Octa
and their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

15:33.244 --> 15:35.813
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

15:35.882 --> 15:37.656
You wanna know what all this
has been leading to?

15:37.680 --> 15:38.726
Yeah.

15:38.799 --> 15:41.163
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

15:41.236 --> 15:42.725
Once these phones
hit the streets,

15:42.795 --> 15:45.636
they'll siphon their users'
information to the black market.

15:45.712 --> 15:49.394
Meaning Octa's selling privacy
to up their profit.

15:49.468 --> 15:52.389
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

15:52.465 --> 15:54.545
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

15:55.382 --> 15:57.303
Rehearsal's over, guys.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.062
This is what we've
been waiting for.

15:59.138 --> 16:00.582
Now it's time to get to work.

16:03.894 --> 16:05.781
[indistinct chatter]

16:07.730 --> 16:09.969
[female announcer]
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,</i>

16:10.047 --> 16:11.696

16:11.766 --> 16:15.050
<i>We're delighted that you've joined us

16:19.198 --> 16:20.847
<i>Our latest product, Octa 8...</i>

16:20.917 --> 16:23.679
[Jack] Keys, cell phones,
iPads, in the bin.

16:23.754 --> 16:25.641
Thank you, sir.

16:25.712 --> 16:30.156
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording, or eating.

16:30.267 --> 16:32.916
Sorry, we will take very good
care of it for you.

16:34.143 --> 16:35.667
Oh, by the way.

16:35.742 --> 16:37.424
Security memo from Case himself.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.979
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

16:41.056 --> 16:42.978
We're all good.
I'm heading to the control room.

16:43.054 --> 16:44.543
All right. Thanks, Jack.

16:45.372 --> 16:49.009
- Atlas, go.
- No, Dylan, I can't...

16:49.088 --> 16:51.462
- [Dylan] <i>What? What's the problem?</i>
- No, there's too many people...

16:51.486 --> 16:53.805
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

16:53.884 --> 16:55.293
Okay, I'm going now.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.010
- Stop.
- Oh.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.285
[Atlas clears throat]

16:58.359 --> 16:59.883
- Okay.
- Thanks.

16:59.958 --> 17:02.242
- Pascal, we need you in the kitchen.
- [door closes]

17:02.315 --> 17:04.122
[indistinct announcement over PA]

17:09.627 --> 17:12.105
[cell phone ringing]

17:14.383 --> 17:15.383
[beeps]

17:20.457 --> 17:22.184
Look, the speech is about freedom, okay?

17:22.255 --> 17:23.950
That's what we're trying
to sell here, is freedom.

17:23.973 --> 17:25.387
Which part of that
do you not understand?

17:25.412 --> 17:26.906
- I know, I'm sorry.
- For goodness sake!

17:26.931 --> 17:29.534
Mr. Case, John from legal.
Just need your signature for release.

17:29.608 --> 17:31.256
Thank you so much.

17:31.326 --> 17:33.406
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

17:40.397 --> 17:42.051
- Hey there, buddy! Smile!
- [camera clicks]

17:42.075 --> 17:43.917
- Who are you? What the hell?
- Who am I?

17:43.993 --> 17:46.358
It is picture day.
Did Julie not tell you it's picture day?

17:46.431 --> 17:48.245
- Picture day? What are you...
- Company-wide policy.

17:48.269 --> 17:50.043
- Look, I got a job to do.
- I have a job to do, too.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.272
Hold on a second.
What is that?

17:51.346 --> 17:52.441
I'm going to need some backup here.

17:52.465 --> 17:53.640
Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

17:53.664 --> 17:54.744
Security, my name is...

17:54.823 --> 17:56.357
- Bo Walsh, thank you.
- Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

17:56.381 --> 17:57.745
Not this guy.
He's not Bo Walsh.

17:57.820 --> 17:58.820
Calm down, please.

17:58.899 --> 18:00.467
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.111
This guy just came and
put a flashlight in my eyes.

18:02.135 --> 18:04.340
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

18:04.413 --> 18:06.091
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

18:06.131 --> 18:08.131
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

18:08.209 --> 18:09.688
- Mark D. Stooge."
- Hold on a second.

18:09.728 --> 18:10.783
I've never seen
this before in my life.

18:10.807 --> 18:12.011
I'm sorry, Mr. Walsh.

18:12.085 --> 18:13.380
- Come on, Mr. Stooge.
- Hold on. He's not Mr. Walsh!

18:13.404 --> 18:15.211
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's going on here?

18:15.282 --> 18:17.044
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

18:17.120 --> 18:21.360
God, you cannot trust anybody
in this city anymore, can you?

18:21.476 --> 18:23.250
Get off me!
Look, I want to make a phone call.

18:23.274 --> 18:25.208
- I want to call my boss!
- Hey, hey! What's going on?

18:25.232 --> 18:27.198
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

18:27.310 --> 18:29.244
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

18:29.268 --> 18:31.473
That's my right.

18:31.546 --> 18:33.387
- What the hell?
- You're crazy. Let's go.

18:33.464 --> 18:35.112
This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

18:35.182 --> 18:36.865
Where's my phone?

18:36.940 --> 18:38.703
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

18:38.779 --> 18:40.063
Okay.

18:40.137 --> 18:42.786
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

18:43.933 --> 18:45.343
[crowd cheering]

18:45.412 --> 18:47.492
[female announcer]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Case.</i>

18:47.570 --> 18:50.173
All right. Lula, show these guys
what you're made of.

18:50.247 --> 18:51.577
[all applauding]

18:57.080 --> 18:59.921
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

18:59.997 --> 19:01.282
What break? Who's Clark?

19:01.356 --> 19:03.004
[chuckles]
"Who's Clark?" That's funny.

19:03.074 --> 19:05.439
Imagine if I told Roger that,
he'd freak out.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.433
- Don't do that!
- What?

19:07.510 --> 19:08.840
Who the hell is Roger?

19:08.908 --> 19:10.483
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

19:10.507 --> 19:11.842
- I don't know who Lisa is.
- Are you kidding again?

19:11.865 --> 19:13.879
- You don't know who Lisa is now?
- No, I don't. Just get away.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.108
- That is a dangerous...
- You're ruining the meat.

19:16.181 --> 19:17.705
Don't make me have to go to Brian!

19:17.780 --> 19:19.354
- I don't know who Brian is!
- Why are you acting like this?

19:19.378 --> 19:20.896
- I'll go straight to him.
- Give me...

19:21.816 --> 19:23.782
- Oh, my God!
- [screaming]

19:23.893 --> 19:25.576
- [people gasping]
- [glass shattering]

19:26.531 --> 19:28.179
[Lula] <i>What are you
doing to me?</i>

19:28.529 --> 19:30.609
- Help me!
- [Owen] Help her. Go!

19:30.727 --> 19:31.965
[Lula screaming]

19:32.045 --> 19:34.489
Have some water.

19:34.603 --> 19:37.285
I feel from your face
you're freaked by the flow of blood,

19:37.360 --> 19:39.008
which is fully fixable in a snap

19:39.078 --> 19:42.602
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

19:42.675 --> 19:44.959
as you're flowing and floating,

19:45.032 --> 19:47.953
which is why you're focusing
on my commands.

19:48.029 --> 19:49.439
[echoing]
You got this far in life

19:49.508 --> 19:52.111
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.066
This is that voice.

19:54.183 --> 19:55.308
[door closes]

19:56.501 --> 19:57.944
Look at the light.

19:58.059 --> 20:00.866
Listen to your own voice.

20:00.976 --> 20:02.739
[video camera beeping]

20:05.252 --> 20:07.696
Oh, my God.
[groaning]

20:10.567 --> 20:13.408
Wow. What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

20:13.484 --> 20:15.166
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

20:15.242 --> 20:18.686
You have taught me that I'm not
cut out for this kind of work.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.361
I quit!

20:20.477 --> 20:22.159
Get another towel.

20:22.635 --> 20:24.601
Thank you, and goodbye.

20:24.673 --> 20:26.639
- [people gasping]
- Oh, God.

20:28.788 --> 20:30.993
[female announcer]
Welcome everybody!

20:31.066 --> 20:33.987
And now, the moment
that you've all been waiting for...

20:35.222 --> 20:37.188
- Nice work, lady.
- Thanks.

20:37.260 --> 20:40.306
[announcer]
Revolutionized music with Octa 2.

20:42.095 --> 20:44.982
I'm actually nervous,
and I'm not even going onstage.

20:45.052 --> 20:47.257
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

20:47.330 --> 20:50.331
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

20:50.407 --> 20:52.169
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

20:52.245 --> 20:53.927
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.333
So, I don't know.

20:55.402 --> 20:58.608
- Do you want... We should try it.
- Not the right mood.

20:58.679 --> 21:00.281
Guess that leaves
you and me, old buddy.

21:00.357 --> 21:03.164
What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

21:03.833 --> 21:06.198
I mean, I admit,
from the neck up there are issues.

21:06.311 --> 21:09.391
But from the neck down, the David.

21:09.468 --> 21:10.911
Owen Case.

21:10.986 --> 21:12.873
[all cheering]

21:12.944 --> 21:16.388
Good morning, Octa-lites.

21:17.420 --> 21:18.908
Now, I've made the claim...

21:19.018 --> 21:21.746
<i>Now, I've made the claim
that Octa 8 is pure magic.</i>

21:21.815 --> 21:24.861
But the truth is, that's just
one of those things I say...

21:24.932 --> 21:28.331
<i>You know, the truth is,
that's just one of those things I say...</i>

21:28.409 --> 21:30.648
...when in fact
I mean something else.

21:30.766 --> 21:34.926
<i>...when in fact
I mean something else.</i>

21:35.002 --> 21:36.287
What else do I mean?

21:36.361 --> 21:42.636
<i>Well, here to fill you in on some of my
fabulous lies and hypocrisy,</i>

21:42.714 --> 21:46.682
<i>and to perform some of the most dazzling
feats of magic you have ever seen...</i>

21:46.750 --> 21:49.354
- They are the world's...
<i>- greatest magicians.</i>

21:49.428 --> 21:52.190
<i>Here to expose me
for the fraud I truly am.</i>

21:52.265 --> 21:56.585
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Horsemen.</i>

21:58.858 --> 22:00.188
[audience gasping]

22:03.733 --> 22:05.302
[all cheering]

22:05.372 --> 22:06.974
[cameras clicking]

22:10.407 --> 22:12.169
[Atlas] Hello, New York!

22:12.285 --> 22:14.172
Thank you so much.

22:14.243 --> 22:16.005
Hey, it's great to be back.

22:16.081 --> 22:19.366
[Atlas] And have you met
our newest Horseman, Lula?

22:22.595 --> 22:26.437
- Feels good, right?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.636
[Atlas]
Thank you, thank you. Um, okay.

22:30.706 --> 22:32.469
We want to talk to you
about your privacy.

22:32.545 --> 22:34.545
What does your privacy mean to you?

22:34.623 --> 22:37.385
Because apparently to Owen Case,
it means absolutely nothing.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.903
No, actually it means less
than absolutely nothing.

22:40.017 --> 22:43.063
You see, he's mocked your privacy.
He's scorned it.

22:43.134 --> 22:46.171
Right, and we're not just talking about
the things that you already agreed to

22:46.211 --> 22:48.416
when you signed,
probably without reading

22:48.489 --> 22:51.694
the terms and conditions
of Octas 1 through 7.

22:55.402 --> 22:58.243
Dylan, the FBI is here.

22:58.319 --> 23:00.637
All right. Don't worry about it.

23:00.716 --> 23:02.716
All right, go to plan C-4.

23:03.993 --> 23:05.834
Lock the doors.

23:05.911 --> 23:07.514
Hey, boss, I'm glad you're here.

23:07.590 --> 23:08.999
Don't.

23:09.548 --> 23:12.196
[Dylan] Guys, look. We got to move
around, get in through the back.

23:12.265 --> 23:13.550
These Horsemen are tricky, okay?

23:13.623 --> 23:16.703
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

23:16.780 --> 23:18.826
Hey, sorry, don't mean to gloat,
but I told you so.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.103
Cut the bullshit, Rhodes.

23:20.177 --> 23:22.337
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

23:22.415 --> 23:24.097
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

23:24.173 --> 23:25.228
What are you talking about?

23:25.252 --> 23:26.626
You sent agents
to Detroit and Philadelphia.

23:26.650 --> 23:28.935
You've been crying wolf
so we wouldn't send them here.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.611
- Boss, please.
- Keep working on the doors.

23:31.725 --> 23:35.646
Please tell me that you haven't bought
into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

23:35.721 --> 23:37.290
[Lula] Before we start the show...

23:37.360 --> 23:41.077
We had Owen agree to a few terms
and conditions of our own.

23:41.156 --> 23:44.157
So, everything that he had
once considered private...

23:44.233 --> 23:45.596
- [static]
- [audience booing]

23:45.671 --> 23:48.797
That he thinks is really private...

23:48.868 --> 23:52.835
Yeah, everything that he once
considered private is now...

23:52.904 --> 23:54.268
- [devices powering down]
- Oh, my.

23:56.541 --> 23:58.189
[high-pitched static]

23:58.259 --> 24:03.055
<i>As the Horsemen like to say,
magic is about controlling perception.</i>

24:03.134 --> 24:07.180
<i>You see them as champions of the truth,
but are they?</i>

24:07.250 --> 24:10.171
<i>Or is that just another
one of their illusions?</i>

24:10.247 --> 24:12.815
- What's going on, Rhodes?
- [stammers] This is crazy.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.379
We got to get everyone
to the other exits.

24:14.403 --> 24:17.006
- Let's go, to the back.
- No. You stay here.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.285
<i>So, since they clearly
love secrets...</i>

24:19.358 --> 24:21.881
<i>Let's reveal some of theirs.</i>

24:21.955 --> 24:23.682
Danny, everyone, get off the stage.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.799
<i>- Abort.</i>
- [all screaming]

24:25.871 --> 24:28.553
Jack, go with them.
I'll see you at the meet-up point.

24:28.628 --> 24:29.628
[Atlas] Let's go.

24:29.707 --> 24:31.833
[man on video]
<i>Do you recall the death of Jack Wilder?</i>

24:31.905 --> 24:37.350
<i>What if I told you he's not just alive,
but he's actually right here.</i>

24:38.379 --> 24:39.583
[crowd gasping]

24:39.657 --> 24:41.021
[cameras clicking]

24:43.893 --> 24:47.178
<i>And do you know who else is here?
The FBI.</i>

24:47.250 --> 24:49.455
<i>Let's let them in, shall we?</i>

24:49.527 --> 24:50.857
[doors unlocking]

24:50.926 --> 24:52.688
<i>And now, for the big reveal.</i>

24:52.764 --> 24:55.413
[Austin]
Go! Go! To the stage.

24:55.482 --> 24:57.561
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

24:57.639 --> 25:00.402
<i>and he's the biggest
criminal of them all.</i>

25:00.516 --> 25:03.120
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

25:03.194 --> 25:04.637
[audience exclaiming]

25:04.712 --> 25:06.395
- [Cowan] I knew it.
- [Austin] What?

25:07.869 --> 25:09.547
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

25:09.587 --> 25:11.801
You think you're looking at one thing,
but you have no idea.

25:11.825 --> 25:14.269
- Who are you?
- The same man I've always been.

25:14.343 --> 25:16.105
- Boys, I'm sorry.
- [handcuffs clattering]

25:17.779 --> 25:19.223
[handcuffs clicking]

25:24.732 --> 25:26.460
[Cowan]
You gotta be kidding me.

25:26.610 --> 25:28.576
[Jack]
We've gotta get to the chute. Go!

25:28.648 --> 25:31.411
- [Lula] Who are those guys?
- [Jack] Who cares? Come on!

25:31.485 --> 25:32.690
- Hurry, hurry!
- Keep going!

25:32.764 --> 25:33.819
How the hell could this happen?

25:33.843 --> 25:35.577
I thought Dylan
had everything under control.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.364
Yeah. Apparently he didn't.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.519
Maybe you're the leak, Dan.
Where you been sneaking off to?

25:40.596 --> 25:42.131
Don't you dare for a second
insinuate that I had...

25:42.155 --> 25:45.553
- I'm not insinuating. That's your...
- Let's get to the truck, come on!

25:45.631 --> 25:47.791
- Stay together!
- Move! Move!

25:47.869 --> 25:48.915
Lula, come on!

25:48.988 --> 25:50.909
Coming! Whoa!

25:50.986 --> 25:52.827
[all screaming]

25:53.863 --> 25:54.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:58.139 --> 25:59.468
[screaming robotically]

25:59.537 --> 26:03.220

<i>Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.</i>

26:04.333 --> 26:05.901
[all groaning]

26:05.971 --> 26:07.653
[Lula screaming]

26:07.729 --> 26:09.332
[indistinct chatter]

26:13.723 --> 26:15.167
What the hell is going on?

26:15.242 --> 26:17.615
- Wasn't there supposed to be a truck?
- Where the hell are we?

26:17.639 --> 26:19.719
[shouting in Cantonese]

26:19.797 --> 26:21.036
Come on!

26:21.116 --> 26:23.003
Hey, hey!
Wait, did you mis-run the tube?

26:23.074 --> 26:24.722
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

26:24.792 --> 26:26.407
[Atlas] Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

26:26.430 --> 26:27.805
[Merritt] Somebody must
have moved the tube.

26:27.829 --> 26:29.364
Were we above a Chinese restaurant?
Give me that!

26:29.388 --> 26:31.985
- [Jack] I'm moving! Relax!
- [Lula] There's something very wrong.

26:34.303 --> 26:36.507
Okay. Why are we here?

26:36.580 --> 26:38.546
Why am I frickin' starving?

26:38.618 --> 26:40.744
[Jack]
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

26:40.816 --> 26:43.101
This makes no sense.

26:45.931 --> 26:47.091
[horn honking]

27:07.030 --> 27:08.393
Okay, sorry.

27:09.667 --> 27:12.032
At least, and I know this
isn't much consolation,

27:12.105 --> 27:14.833
but apparently
we're now surrounded by Chinese food.

27:14.902 --> 27:17.187
- Right?
- Guys...

27:17.260 --> 27:20.817
I think where we are right now, they
don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

27:20.896 --> 27:23.624
It's just called "food."

27:27.889 --> 27:30.571
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

27:30.646 --> 27:32.885
[laughing]

27:32.964 --> 27:38.408
I believe in your particular parlance,
the word is "magic."

27:38.518 --> 27:40.996
That guy looks exactly like you.

27:41.076 --> 27:44.122
He looks exactly like you.
Are you seeing this right now?

27:44.193 --> 27:45.352
Chase.

27:45.431 --> 27:49.398
Must confess, it's like what I heard
about meeting the Rolling Stones.

27:49.467 --> 27:51.388
They're a lot shorter in person.

27:51.465 --> 27:54.307
Remember I told you about the guy
who screwed me out of everything?

27:54.382 --> 27:57.667
This is my twin brother, Chase.

27:57.819 --> 27:59.546
Wait, did you do this?

27:59.617 --> 28:01.777
- [men shouting]
- [guns cocking]

28:01.855 --> 28:05.651
[Chase chuckles] As you can see,
my boss don't mess around.

28:05.731 --> 28:08.413
I do not understand what is
going on right now. At all.

28:08.488 --> 28:10.568
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

28:10.646 --> 28:14.692
You jumped off a rooftop in New York
and you landed in Macau.

28:14.762 --> 28:18.286
AKA the Vegas of China.

28:18.358 --> 28:20.677
And presto-changes.

28:20.756 --> 28:21.916
Don't you just love it?

28:21.995 --> 28:24.075
The "greatest magicians in the world"

28:24.153 --> 28:26.630
are the object
of someone else's magic trick?

28:26.710 --> 28:28.870
Isn't that poetic?

28:30.306 --> 28:34.546
No? [stammers] You know what,
I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.

28:34.622 --> 28:37.066
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

28:37.140 --> 28:38.344
[men clamoring]

28:38.418 --> 28:43.136
Oh, and you know what they say,
"What happens in Macau..."

28:43.214 --> 28:46.453
Uh, well, I don't know the rest of it,
'cause it's in Chinese, uh...

28:46.530 --> 28:48.258
Hey, thanks, guys!

29:12.424 --> 29:14.027
<i>The trick was on them, however,</i>

29:14.143 --> 29:17.461

I've been leaving you messages.

Please, call me!

[male news anchor]
<i>And the stock market</i>

[ringing]

29:43.873 --> 29:45.475
Hey, tell me you're safe.
Where are you?

29:45.551 --> 29:49.871
[Thaddeus] Right where you left me,
18 months ago, Agent Rhodes.

Thaddeus?

29:51.225 --> 29:53.067

to lose everything?</i>

29:53.184 --> 29:57.105
Your job. Your identity.
Your reason for living.

29:57.180 --> 30:00.305
How does it feel to be out of control,
perhaps for the first time?

30:02.774 --> 30:03.899
What do you want?

30:03.973 --> 30:06.974
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes.
You always have been.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.054
- Where are they?
- I'm not telling you on the phone!

30:10.127 --> 30:11.127
Where are they?

30:11.205 --> 30:15.206
And if you're wondering if I was behind
the Horsemen's recent debacle,

30:15.281 --> 30:17.044
I'll let you work
that out for yourself.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.121
Hey, I burned you once, I'll burn
you again. I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

30:20.196 --> 30:22.879
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.431
You started it when
you locked me in a cell.

30:25.511 --> 30:27.193

31:00.756 --> 31:02.677
[Chase]
It's all about blind spots.

31:02.754 --> 31:07.596
When you're staring straight
at something, and not see it. Why?

31:08.348 --> 31:10.031
Blind spots.

31:10.107 --> 31:12.345
We learned that together,
didn't we, bro?

31:12.424 --> 31:15.265
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

31:15.341 --> 31:18.501
No? I didn't think so.

And then, one day, we were 12
and Virginia von Welsheim

31:35.241 --> 31:38.128
had a very nice party
down the street.

31:38.198 --> 31:40.517
I had a little tum-tum, couldn't go.

31:40.596 --> 31:46.120
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and got
a taste of the solo thing, and uh...

- ...and kicked me to the curb.
- Oh, God.

31:50.866 --> 31:55.344

Just tell me how you did it.

your private information,

32:28.268 --> 32:31.428
and my employer
had all he needed.

32:31.505 --> 32:32.869
Thanks.

32:32.944 --> 32:35.751
How did you know how to find him?

32:35.821 --> 32:39.027
- That's a very good question, Atlas.
- Okay.

32:56.280 --> 33:00.042
[Chase] Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

33:03.473 --> 33:07.190
Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse
with you, broski.

33:07.309 --> 33:09.116
Meow.

33:09.187 --> 33:10.711
[chase laughing]

33:10.786 --> 33:13.263
Have fun at the Sands.

33:13.623 --> 33:15.430
[people cheering]

33:16.940 --> 33:19.861
- I am so, so, so sorry.
- Yeah, you should be.

33:19.977 --> 33:23.136
Don't ever accuse me
of betraying us again, okay?

33:35.521 --> 33:38.249
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

33:38.318 --> 33:40.796
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

33:42.914 --> 33:44.516
And at the exact right moment,

33:44.592 --> 33:46.831
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

33:46.910 --> 33:48.751
"Yes! Thank God you're here!

33:48.828 --> 33:51.305
Thank God!
Just in the nick of time, Eye!"

33:51.385 --> 33:55.386
And then we'll just celebrate,
and it was all worth it in the end?

33:59.577 --> 34:01.623
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

34:01.695 --> 34:03.616
- It's cool.
- [elevator dings]

34:03.693 --> 34:05.375
[doors open]

34:05.451 --> 34:07.338
[rock music playing]

34:17.958 --> 34:19.038
Ah.

34:19.996 --> 34:20.996
Ta-da!

34:22.634 --> 34:24.714
So happy to be working with you.

34:24.792 --> 34:26.469
- [music stops]
- Please, come in. Come in.

34:26.510 --> 34:28.636
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:28.708 --> 34:30.081
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

34:30.106 --> 34:33.027
Oh, well, as much as a magician
who pulls a rabbit from a hat

34:33.143 --> 34:35.949
is working with that rabbit.

34:36.020 --> 34:39.578
We'll be working together. Yes.
Allow me to introduce myself.

34:39.657 --> 34:42.179
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

34:42.254 --> 34:44.141
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

34:44.212 --> 34:46.132
Fake your death,
the world puts its guard down.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.210
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

34:48.288 --> 34:49.812
including my old partner, Owen's,

34:49.887 --> 34:53.012
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

34:53.083 --> 34:56.801
- And that violates how many SEC laws?
- I believe it breaks all of them.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.243
[gasps] All of them.

34:58.318 --> 35:01.205
You see, you all want an audience.

35:01.275 --> 35:04.719
Need one, desperately.
It's quite sad, really.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.872
Hence, my ability to nab you.

35:06.949 --> 35:09.757
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

35:09.827 --> 35:14.225
I just want to be, and I am
100 percent off the grid.

35:14.302 --> 35:15.587
You know why?

35:15.661 --> 35:18.184
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

35:18.258 --> 35:20.577
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

35:20.656 --> 35:23.782
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

35:23.892 --> 35:26.131
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

35:26.210 --> 35:28.097
- Follow me.
- Yeah.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.975
- Follow me.
- Okay. All right.

35:30.046 --> 35:32.331
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit.
That was very colorful.

35:32.404 --> 35:35.927
Almost eight and a half years ago.
So, no need to bring that up.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.649
We can't all be held accountable
for our adolescent personas.

35:38.718 --> 35:40.844
Can we, Magicolio?

35:40.915 --> 35:43.234
Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.

35:43.313 --> 35:45.200
Don't get me wrong, I love magic.

35:45.271 --> 35:46.476
Like you, and many others who,

35:46.550 --> 35:49.596
I suppose, were not getting any sex
in high school, I dabbled with it.

35:49.667 --> 35:55.031
But, uh, unlike you, I was able to
transition upward towards actual magic.

35:55.141 --> 35:57.267
Science, you may
have heard it called.

35:59.777 --> 36:04.141
So, would you like to know,
my friends, just how I got you here?

36:04.212 --> 36:05.542
We know how you did it.

36:05.611 --> 36:06.611
No, you don't.

36:06.690 --> 36:09.418
Yeah, you stole our files for the show,
then obviously hypnotized us.

36:09.487 --> 36:10.930
Stop. No. Seriously, stop.

36:11.005 --> 36:13.324
The strobe was a combo
of binaural beats, as well as...

36:13.403 --> 36:15.768
I said stop!

36:15.840 --> 36:18.318
You might not be having fun,
but I am.

36:19.117 --> 36:21.561
You have an unusual way of showing it.

36:22.194 --> 36:23.194
So...

36:23.992 --> 36:25.833
How did I do it?

36:25.910 --> 36:30.468
Easy. You see, magicians like to control
other people's perceptions.

36:30.546 --> 36:31.880
In your heightened state of agitation,

36:31.904 --> 36:34.269
<i>you saw the simplest cues.
Black tube, roof.</i>

36:34.342 --> 36:36.741
<i>And your minds filled in the rest.</i>

36:36.819 --> 36:39.661
<i>But the tube you meant to go down
was 20 feet to your right.</i>

36:39.737 --> 36:41.791
Go on, sit down. There's no one
standing in your way.

36:41.814 --> 36:43.303
Don't mind if I do.

36:45.171 --> 36:47.331
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

36:47.409 --> 36:51.205
<i>Blah, blah, blah, the strobe contained
UV letters pulsing the word "sleep."</i>

36:53.283 --> 36:57.079
<i>And that, combined with the sound,
put you into an instant alpha pattern.</i>

36:57.159 --> 36:59.966
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

37:00.036 --> 37:01.719
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

37:01.794 --> 37:05.159
And I can assure you,
you don't know what happened.

37:05.231 --> 37:06.641
[slow music playing on video]

37:09.866 --> 37:12.867
That's really creepy.
Really, really creepy.

37:15.541 --> 37:16.950
[Merritt] That's not cool.

37:17.059 --> 37:19.185
[Walter]
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

37:19.896 --> 37:21.306
if you put your mind to it.

37:21.375 --> 37:23.373
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

37:23.413 --> 37:26.141
Besides you getting to show off
how adorably clever you are.

37:26.210 --> 37:29.017
Well, to start with,
the man you stole from last year,

37:29.087 --> 37:31.884
turns out I had invested quite a lot
of money in some of his companies,

37:31.924 --> 37:35.130
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

37:35.201 --> 37:37.963
Good news is, it's very easy for you
to pay me back.

37:38.038 --> 37:40.766
I just need your skills.

37:40.835 --> 37:43.723
Owen and I were like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

37:43.792 --> 37:44.838
Elfin?

37:44.911 --> 37:46.241
...geniuses.

37:46.350 --> 37:47.952
Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.

37:48.028 --> 37:50.347
And like them, we had a dream.

37:51.225 --> 37:54.907
Could we create actual, genuine magic?

37:54.981 --> 37:58.380
And I'm guessing one of you achieved
that dream, and it wasn't you?

37:58.458 --> 38:01.584
That is what he
would like you to think.

38:01.655 --> 38:06.735
My vision was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.168
But Owen wanted it for himself
so he humiliated me

38:09.247 --> 38:12.407
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

38:12.484 --> 38:13.962
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

38:14.002 --> 38:16.162
Did you take a picture of him
while he was sleeping?

38:16.240 --> 38:17.655
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

38:17.679 --> 38:20.043
and now he goes around
taking credit for a chip

38:20.116 --> 38:21.878
that's not just the key to one computer,

38:21.954 --> 38:24.955
but every computer
system on the planet.

38:25.031 --> 38:28.111
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defense firewall,

38:28.188 --> 38:30.950
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

38:31.025 --> 38:32.823
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

38:32.863 --> 38:34.558
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it?

38:34.582 --> 38:35.991
So he gets the money?

38:36.100 --> 38:38.260
And the pleasure? No.

38:38.338 --> 38:41.578
No, no, no. Besides, why would I buy it
when I could have you steal it for me?

38:41.655 --> 38:42.814
Oh!

38:42.933 --> 38:44.907
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

38:44.931 --> 38:48.569
which will include your targets,
a crew lead by a South African gangster.

38:48.648 --> 38:50.136
South African gangster.

38:50.206 --> 38:51.980
Yes. How your team
gets past security, that's up to you.

38:52.004 --> 38:55.244
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

38:55.321 --> 38:56.321
That's it?

38:56.400 --> 38:58.207
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

38:58.278 --> 38:59.413
You're magicians and thieves.

38:59.437 --> 39:02.040
What makes you think we would even
consider doing this?

39:02.114 --> 39:05.479
Um, oh, wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Oh, yes.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.165
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

39:07.189 --> 39:10.474
But here, I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

39:10.546 --> 39:13.751
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

39:14.622 --> 39:17.225
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

39:19.257 --> 39:21.860
You know what?
I'm not stealing a thing for you.

39:21.974 --> 39:26.055
- Not unless Dylan tells me it's okay.
- Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

39:26.130 --> 39:29.017
It doesn't matter. Yeah, I'm with him.
So you can go ahead and kill us

39:29.087 --> 39:31.125
because I'm not gonna
steal anything for you either.

39:31.165 --> 39:34.768
[Merritt] Strikes me that a consensus
seems to be forming, Walter,

39:34.841 --> 39:36.365
and we're calling your bluff.

39:38.078 --> 39:40.124
- [Atlas] Actually, we'll do it.
- [both] What?

39:40.196 --> 39:42.958
We're in Macau. The oldest
magic store in the world is here.

39:43.033 --> 39:46.398
We'll get the supplies
we need, and we'll do it.

39:47.029 --> 39:48.916
Thank you.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.476
It should be fun.

39:50.546 --> 39:53.547
Chase will take you
to the magic shop in the morning.

39:58.657 --> 39:59.657
[guard] Badge.

40:03.373 --> 40:04.533
[scoffs] Really?

40:06.649 --> 40:08.059
Thanks.

40:08.128 --> 40:12.573
[guard]
Agent Cowan. Your ID.

40:12.683 --> 40:14.093
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

40:14.681 --> 40:15.681
[door buzzing]

40:18.158 --> 40:20.635
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

40:20.715 --> 40:23.444
Yeah? Tell him recess is over.

40:23.513 --> 40:24.922
[operatic music playing]

40:26.669 --> 40:27.715
[Dylan scoffs]

40:31.345 --> 40:32.345
What?

40:39.656 --> 40:41.020
[door buzzes and opens]

40:50.486 --> 40:51.849
All right, so I made my move.

40:51.924 --> 40:54.084
Where are they?
I don't have time for bullshit.

40:54.162 --> 40:56.685
Oh, I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

40:56.759 --> 41:00.158
And I didn't get to finish my lobster,
which makes me very grumpy.

41:00.236 --> 41:02.998
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

41:03.073 --> 41:06.233
You can dispense with
the tough guy act to begin with.

41:06.350 --> 41:08.873
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

41:10.985 --> 41:13.588
I said, what do you want?

41:13.662 --> 41:17.266
You used a form 219 warrant
to search my room.

41:17.339 --> 41:20.021
You found a connection
between me and the Four Horsemen.

41:20.096 --> 41:25.222
Which means you can take me
out of here on a 24-hour leave.

41:25.291 --> 41:29.497
- You want me to break you out?
- I want you to take me out.

41:29.566 --> 41:32.135
All you need is an extradition order,

41:32.204 --> 41:34.932
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

41:35.800 --> 41:41.165
Dylan, I had nothing to do
with the Horsemen's disappearance.

41:41.235 --> 41:43.712
You were lured into a trap.

41:43.792 --> 41:46.838
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

41:46.909 --> 41:53.149
you're beginning to realize
that the only way out is through.

41:53.223 --> 41:56.224
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

41:57.139 --> 41:58.502
You got this place wired.

41:58.577 --> 42:02.703
You don't need me to get out of here.
This is all about payback.

42:02.773 --> 42:06.569
- I believe in an eye for an eye.
- So you're out to destroy me?

42:06.649 --> 42:07.854
Oh, absolutely.

42:07.928 --> 42:09.223
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

42:09.247 --> 42:10.929
I know you will.

42:11.005 --> 42:15.006
Because no matter how hard you try
to find a culprit behind all this,

42:15.081 --> 42:17.446
you're going to blame only yourself.

42:17.558 --> 42:22.003
When your little vendetta ended with you
putting me in jail 18 months ago,

42:22.074 --> 42:25.961
you got tired, you got sloppy.
You stopped paying attention.

42:26.030 --> 42:28.076
And that's where you lost.

42:28.148 --> 42:29.636
[door buzzes and opens]

42:31.265 --> 42:34.743
So, you can save yourself,

42:36.499 --> 42:40.978
or you can make a deal with me,
and save the Four Horsemen,

42:41.055 --> 42:44.340
and stop wasting both of our time.

42:46.489 --> 42:51.934
Steal something for this narcissistic
little man boy? I don't like it.

42:52.004 --> 42:54.130
But what I like less
is you deciding for us.

42:54.202 --> 42:56.815
Yeah? Do you like that we're the
laughing stocks of the magic world,

42:56.839 --> 42:58.680
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

42:58.757 --> 43:00.484
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

43:00.555 --> 43:01.794
But we can fix that.

43:01.874 --> 43:03.079
- We can fix it?
- Yeah.

43:03.153 --> 43:04.727
So you're officially
part of the team now?

43:04.751 --> 43:06.558
- Excuse me?
- I'm sure this is what Dylan

43:06.629 --> 43:08.763
meant when he said we should
all work as a single organism.

43:08.787 --> 43:12.027
Yeah, that is a fairytale
that Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

43:12.104 --> 43:14.752
Look, even if we get this stick,
he'll never let us go.

43:14.821 --> 43:18.902
We can't trust Walter, okay?
The Eye has a history in Macau.

43:19.017 --> 43:20.392
They're the only ones we can trust.

43:20.415 --> 43:21.470
Now, if we can get it to them,

43:21.494 --> 43:23.779
they can clear our names
and get us the hell out of here.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.381
[Lula] It's a bad plan, man.

43:27.209 --> 43:28.618
[door bells jingling]

43:33.043 --> 43:34.964
- Hey.
- [dinging]

43:35.041 --> 43:36.326
Hi, how are you?

43:36.399 --> 43:38.366
Um, we need some
things custom-made.

43:38.437 --> 43:40.092
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

43:40.116 --> 43:41.798
And...

43:41.874 --> 43:44.079
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

43:44.791 --> 43:46.632
[both speaking Mandarin]

43:50.026 --> 43:53.311
Welcome to long's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

43:53.382 --> 43:54.621
- What?
- Got you.

43:54.701 --> 43:55.747
- Okay.
- Look.

43:57.778 --> 43:58.778
Where'd it go?

44:01.414 --> 44:03.222
Oh! And now it's by my head. How fun.

44:03.293 --> 44:04.861
- $20.
- $20?

44:04.931 --> 44:06.818
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

44:06.889 --> 44:09.128
- $10.
- Uh, no.

44:09.207 --> 44:10.491
- Two for one.
- No.

44:10.565 --> 44:12.180
Okay, all right.
Just give us the thumbs. Yeah?

44:12.204 --> 44:14.442
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack.
Please take these.

44:14.521 --> 44:17.170
So, we need a Keplinger holdout,

44:17.239 --> 44:21.240
and we also need roughing fluid,
a Sanada gimmick, sleeves, tracks.

44:21.315 --> 44:23.236
This is all in plastic,
though, if you can.

44:23.313 --> 44:24.722
[both speaking Mandarin]

44:27.828 --> 44:28.828
What?

44:31.065 --> 44:32.588
Is there a problem?

44:32.663 --> 44:35.823
My grandmother wants to know
why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

44:35.900 --> 44:38.185
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

44:38.258 --> 44:41.815
We're going through a very sensitive
metal detector, okay?

44:41.934 --> 44:44.616
So plastic, nothing. Metal...

44:44.691 --> 44:46.657
[imitates alarm blaring]

44:46.729 --> 44:48.775
- It detects.
- [speaking Mandarin]

44:49.526 --> 44:51.891
[imitates alarm blaring]

44:53.283 --> 44:54.328
What did she say?

44:54.401 --> 44:57.766
She said just because you're
talking slowly and moving your hands

44:57.838 --> 44:59.838
doesn't mean she can suddenly
understand English.

44:59.916 --> 45:02.678
[clicks tongue]
Oh, yeah. So sorry. He's racist.

45:02.753 --> 45:06.959
Hey, bro. Listen, I know
that the only thing that we agree on

45:07.029 --> 45:09.632
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

45:09.706 --> 45:13.991
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

45:14.062 --> 45:15.550
and go get a little drinkey-poo?

45:15.620 --> 45:20.985
- If it's free, it's me.
- Great. Guys, we'll be right back.

45:21.055 --> 45:24.658
[Chase] Okay, kiddies,
the chaperones are watching you.

45:24.731 --> 45:27.016
Don't do anything I wouldn't enjoy.

45:28.088 --> 45:30.134
[Atlas]
Okay. Have fun, you two.

45:32.483 --> 45:35.927
Hey. Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.363
Sure.

45:38.198 --> 45:39.846
- On the house.
- Thanks.

45:41.514 --> 45:42.594
Who are you calling?

45:42.673 --> 45:44.168
[Atlas] I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

45:44.192 --> 45:45.954
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

45:46.030 --> 45:47.314
You've been doing it
on your own?

45:47.388 --> 45:48.513
Maybe.

45:48.587 --> 45:50.986
Oh, God.
Dylan's not gonna like this.

45:51.065 --> 45:53.145
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes. Okay?

45:53.223 --> 45:54.461
I'm doing this for us.

45:56.619 --> 46:00.381
- What is wrong with this thing?
- Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.

46:00.455 --> 46:01.785
Yeah, that's what I thought.

46:01.854 --> 46:03.218
- Okay. Let me just...
- Ow!

46:03.292 --> 46:05.657
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

46:07.688 --> 46:10.132
Hey, can you get this?

46:10.206 --> 46:11.330
[door buzzes]

46:14.721 --> 46:16.687
It's like birth, you know.

46:16.759 --> 46:20.203
One person enters the hospital,
two people come out.

46:20.275 --> 46:21.719
Walk and talk.

46:21.794 --> 46:24.113
I'll tell you on the plane.

46:24.192 --> 46:26.317
What plane?

46:26.389 --> 46:29.356
My sources tell me
your Horsemen are in Macau.

46:30.106 --> 46:32.390
- What's the look?
- It's none of your business.

46:32.463 --> 46:33.668
Who are your sources?

46:36.339 --> 46:38.419
Just some old friends.

46:40.695 --> 46:42.695
[both speaking Mandarin]

46:45.250 --> 46:48.251
When we have the card, where do I go?

46:48.327 --> 46:50.726
And 0 for 52.
[chuckles]

46:50.805 --> 46:53.851
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

46:54.921 --> 46:57.762
Then what about girls?

46:57.838 --> 46:59.679
- Like, relationships?
- [groans]

46:59.756 --> 47:00.881
What?

47:04.751 --> 47:08.308
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

47:08.387 --> 47:14.423
but every girl I get close to,
I end up taking their trust.

47:14.501 --> 47:16.979
And then their wallet.

47:17.578 --> 47:18.703
So...

47:21.174 --> 47:23.698
- You take their wallets?
- Yeah.

47:25.930 --> 47:28.056
You ever take their belts?

47:29.486 --> 47:33.931
Or how about some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

47:34.002 --> 47:36.969
Not sure why you took those.

47:37.039 --> 47:40.119
I'm sorry, did you think
that I was like those other girls?

47:41.674 --> 47:43.481
Oh, Jack.

47:49.186 --> 47:51.391
[Atlas] Okay. So there's a marketplace
down the street.

47:51.464 --> 47:53.590
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

47:53.662 --> 47:56.390
He'll get the stick to the right people
and get us home.

47:56.459 --> 47:58.505
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

47:58.577 --> 48:00.304
And, hey, put your belt on.

48:00.375 --> 48:03.058
[stammers] Oh, no, it's not...
She took it off me and...

48:04.291 --> 48:07.132
[Merritt] You know, the most
heartbreaking moment of my life

48:07.208 --> 48:11.926
was when I discovered that you had
stolen all my money and split.

48:12.004 --> 48:14.084
I didn't realize until now

48:14.161 --> 48:16.639
how much of that money
you put into your face.

48:16.719 --> 48:21.276
Seriously, is it weird to have more hair
in your nose than on your head?

48:21.354 --> 48:23.923
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

48:23.992 --> 48:29.629
you might wanna consider requesting
something other than old man pubes.

48:29.706 --> 48:33.752
You know what?
You are such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

48:33.822 --> 48:35.743
And this little ploy you have

48:35.820 --> 48:39.901
of stalling me while your friends
screw over my employer?

48:40.016 --> 48:41.618
Not gonna work.

48:41.694 --> 48:42.819
[giggles]

48:44.012 --> 48:48.217
Chase! As you stare into my eyes,
you will find that you wanna sleep.

48:48.287 --> 48:50.936
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

48:51.005 --> 48:54.164
and realize that you will never be
half the man that he is.

48:54.241 --> 48:55.287
[slaps]

48:56.199 --> 49:02.883
Merritt, I am so,
so very, very sorry

49:02.953 --> 49:05.681
about how pathetic your pupil is.

49:05.750 --> 49:08.910
Hey, a little hint
on your technique of surprise.

49:08.987 --> 49:13.306
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

49:13.822 --> 49:18.186
Hey, this has been fun, Mer-Bear.
Let's do it again sometime.

49:21.614 --> 49:26.536
[Thaddeus] Well, I've had ample time
to do some research, and you know,

49:26.609 --> 49:27.655
I was wrong.

49:27.728 --> 49:31.331
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

49:31.404 --> 49:32.893
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

49:32.963 --> 49:34.963
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

49:35.040 --> 49:38.359
that this road would lead to
the great wizard behind the curtain

49:38.437 --> 49:41.006
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

49:41.074 --> 49:42.279
That ain't gonna happen.

49:42.353 --> 49:43.968
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

49:43.992 --> 49:46.725
Listen to me. I broke you out of there.
We're not changing the terms now.

49:46.749 --> 49:49.477
- You put me there!
- Yeah, because you deserve to be there.

49:49.546 --> 49:53.069
- Listen, I did not kill your father.
- What?

49:53.182 --> 49:56.103
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

49:56.179 --> 49:59.737
I know who you are, Shrike.

50:01.094 --> 50:03.094
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

50:03.172 --> 50:07.139
I know you think I goaded him into
performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

50:07.208 --> 50:12.050
I know the time in jail was a result
of a 30-year revenge plot against me.

50:12.123 --> 50:14.328
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

50:14.401 --> 50:15.606
Man...

50:17.318 --> 50:18.967
Thirty years.

50:19.036 --> 50:24.640
Thirty years, and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

50:24.711 --> 50:28.507
Just to put me behind bars. Okay.

50:30.065 --> 50:31.953
So how did it feel, seeing me there?

50:32.982 --> 50:34.745
Was it all you hoped?

50:34.821 --> 50:36.315
I don't know what you're talking about.

50:36.339 --> 50:40.420
You're lying.
It was an empty experience.

50:40.495 --> 50:42.541
And you wanna know how I know?

50:43.612 --> 50:46.340
I know because you know.

50:47.648 --> 50:52.251
There's always, always more
than what's on the surface.

50:52.323 --> 50:54.777
So what, the past didn't happen,
and you're not who I think you are?

50:54.801 --> 50:55.975
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

50:55.999 --> 50:58.841
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

50:59.516 --> 51:02.835
I am not my father.
You're not getting in my head, okay?

51:02.913 --> 51:05.436
You think you're luring me into a trap?
You're not.

51:05.510 --> 51:08.113
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

51:08.187 --> 51:11.666
My only concern is the health
and well-being of the Horsemen.

51:11.744 --> 51:15.222
And you're gonna lead me to them.
And if you don't, I promise you,

51:15.300 --> 51:19.187
you're gonna end up far worse
than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.

51:32.563 --> 51:36.166
[Thaddeus] What if the Horsemen
don't actually need you to save them?

51:40.715 --> 51:43.522
[Atlas] All right. So the lab
is made up of two distinct layers,

51:43.592 --> 51:46.638
the security perimeter
and the clean room.

51:46.709 --> 51:48.709
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

51:48.787 --> 51:50.833
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

51:50.904 --> 51:52.632
and replace it with a decoy.

51:52.703 --> 51:54.117
Now, we're about to get to the chip.

51:54.141 --> 51:55.756
This is the thing
about the chip, it's very thin.

51:55.780 --> 51:58.667
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size to a playing card,

51:58.737 --> 52:00.695
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

52:02.693 --> 52:03.739
Whoa, whoa!

52:08.167 --> 52:09.327
That's no good.

52:18.837 --> 52:21.041
[Atlas] So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

52:21.114 --> 52:22.921
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

52:22.992 --> 52:24.675
<i>He's RSVP'd with what looks like</i>

52:24.751 --> 52:26.717
<i>a couple of members
of his security detail.</i>

52:26.789 --> 52:29.790
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,
and somebody named Buffy.</i>

52:29.865 --> 52:33.548
[Lula] <i>Yeah, apparently, he travels
with a different bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>

52:33.622 --> 52:36.270
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

52:44.850 --> 52:46.692
Hey, can I get in?

52:48.407 --> 52:49.975
At the soothing sound of the slots

52:50.045 --> 52:53.410
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

52:54.920 --> 52:56.444
[Atlas] <i>Jack, for a moment,</i>

52:56.559 --> 52:59.241
<i>They will think you're Hannes,
so lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

52:59.316 --> 53:01.521
You trust your people implicitly.

53:01.594 --> 53:03.640
You will have them
take care of everything,

53:03.712 --> 53:05.121
and you will wait in the car.

53:05.190 --> 53:08.748
- And eyes open, wide awake. Go.
- [snaps fingers]

53:08.826 --> 53:10.681
[Jack] Excuse me.
These people are following me.

53:10.705 --> 53:11.999
You might wanna
check their pockets.

53:12.023 --> 53:13.467
[arguing in Cantonese]

53:16.019 --> 53:18.338
[Atlas] <i>Then our time is
ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

53:18.417 --> 53:20.551
<i>and get the card to the market,
where I'll hand it off to the Eye,</i>

53:20.575 --> 53:22.098
<i>so we can all get the hell home.</i>

53:41.114 --> 53:44.399
Hannes, my old friend.
So glad you could make it.

53:44.471 --> 53:47.551
I knew you had a soft spot
for an old-school bidding war.

53:47.628 --> 53:48.708
How have you been?

53:48.786 --> 53:52.424
I trust my people implicitly.
What they say goes.

53:52.503 --> 53:55.583
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see it for yourself.

53:55.660 --> 53:58.467
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

54:00.854 --> 54:03.458
Or not. Also fine.

54:03.532 --> 54:05.532
Well, if you'd like to follow me.

54:09.046 --> 54:13.445
You'll have to remove all your metal.
Watches, rings, etc.

54:13.522 --> 54:15.886
- Yeah, of course.
- Excuse me for asking...

54:15.959 --> 54:17.800
Where might I have seen you before?

54:19.116 --> 54:21.560
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

54:21.634 --> 54:22.714
The book jacket!

54:22.792 --> 54:25.634
I have to say, Dr. Michaelakis,
I'm a huge fan.

54:25.710 --> 54:27.551
[chuckling]
Oh, thank you so much.

54:27.628 --> 54:30.105
Uh, which book?
There have been so many...

54:31.264 --> 54:33.992
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

54:35.819 --> 54:36.819
Doctor?

54:39.576 --> 54:43.293
Sorry, when you say "chippy,"
you are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

54:43.372 --> 54:44.532
Of course.

54:46.409 --> 54:50.853
Hannes prefers the term "floozy"
for all his boy toys.

54:50.924 --> 54:53.970
- Yeah. He does. That's good.
- Noted.

54:54.041 --> 54:56.087
By the way,
I got your email, Dr. Michaelakis.

54:56.159 --> 54:57.683
You had a query about our ability

54:57.757 --> 54:59.837
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

54:59.915 --> 55:04.473
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators, or error correction.

55:04.551 --> 55:06.153
Do you care to elucidate?

55:06.229 --> 55:07.593
- Right.
- Yeah.

55:07.668 --> 55:09.634
Yes, I did send that email.

55:09.705 --> 55:12.673
- The other day, I saw you.
- I did, I sent it. So what gives?

55:12.742 --> 55:14.186
I'm sorry, what gives...

55:14.261 --> 55:15.784
I think what she's trying to say...

55:15.859 --> 55:17.873
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

55:17.897 --> 55:19.182
Okay.

55:19.256 --> 55:20.495
If you'll hold on to that.

55:20.575 --> 55:22.302
- Yeah, sure, Doctor.
- Thank you.

55:22.373 --> 55:24.850
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

55:24.930 --> 55:26.976
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

55:27.048 --> 55:30.765
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder." Disorder!

55:30.844 --> 55:35.448
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

55:41.114 --> 55:44.274
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

55:44.391 --> 55:47.437
The emergence of quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

55:47.508 --> 55:50.395
So that is, in fact, what gives.

55:55.420 --> 55:56.500
Thank you.

55:59.056 --> 56:00.545
[beeps]

56:03.052 --> 56:07.098
You know,
Buffy is not a bad name for you.

56:07.168 --> 56:10.771
You know, buff, firm, taut.

56:10.844 --> 56:12.698
That's good.
Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?

56:12.722 --> 56:14.007
Nubile.

56:14.081 --> 56:17.207
- That's good. Thank you. Okay.
- There we go.

56:18.836 --> 56:19.916
[beeps]

56:21.514 --> 56:23.594
- [alarm blaring]
- [gasps]

56:27.428 --> 56:29.190
Sorry, sorry.

56:36.259 --> 56:38.498
The stick's metal.
How are we going to get it out?

56:38.577 --> 56:39.781
Yeah. I don't know.

56:41.014 --> 56:42.776
[Allen] This is the housing.

56:42.852 --> 56:47.410
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

56:52.802 --> 56:55.256
But of course, what sets us apart
from anything else on the planet

56:55.280 --> 56:59.997
is the processor, which we playfully
refer to as the Magic Broomstick.

57:00.075 --> 57:01.075
The Broomstick?

57:01.154 --> 57:04.871
Has the power to clear the contents
of any computing system on the planet

57:04.950 --> 57:07.598
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

57:07.667 --> 57:10.316
Oh! Broomstick. That's funny.

57:10.385 --> 57:13.147
Take a look, vet it however you'd like,

57:13.222 --> 57:15.541
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

57:15.619 --> 57:16.824
- Thank you.
- [Merritt gasps]

57:16.898 --> 57:18.819
[sneezes]

57:18.896 --> 57:21.578
Oh, my God.
I must be allergic to something in here.

57:21.653 --> 57:23.574
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

57:23.651 --> 57:26.857
- This room is hermetically sealed.
- [sneezes] That's it.

57:26.928 --> 57:28.769
I'm allergic to hermetic seals.

57:28.846 --> 57:30.580
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

57:30.604 --> 57:33.287
- That's the one thing.
- Just until he's recovered.

57:33.362 --> 57:34.930
We're gonna need some anti-bac...

57:36.079 --> 57:37.841
Do we have alcohol wipes?

57:37.917 --> 57:40.291
Your hands need to be sterile
if you intend to get any closer.

57:40.315 --> 57:42.520
- Do I make myself clear?
- [Merritt continues sneezing]

57:44.191 --> 57:46.998
- [Atlas] Sorry. We couldn't...
- [Merritt] No, I'm fine.

57:47.068 --> 57:48.363
...take his medicine into the country.

57:48.387 --> 57:49.546
[Lula] Yeah...

57:50.984 --> 57:52.871
[Merritt sneezes]

57:52.942 --> 57:55.386
[Allen]
Can't risk any contamination.

57:55.460 --> 57:58.222
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

57:58.297 --> 57:59.660
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

57:59.735 --> 58:01.390
- All right. If you're done...
- Oh. Here you go.

58:01.414 --> 58:03.141
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

58:03.212 --> 58:05.338
This happens to him sometimes.
It'll pass.

58:05.410 --> 58:07.297
Allergies. Nothing you can do.

58:07.368 --> 58:09.725
- Well, something you could do, Doctor.
- [Merritt sneezing]

58:27.188 --> 58:28.711
[snorting]

58:29.426 --> 58:30.426
[Atlas] Okay?

58:37.458 --> 58:38.458
Search him, please.

58:38.536 --> 58:39.980
[Lula]
Didn't we just do that?

58:40.055 --> 58:41.385
Are you serious?

58:41.454 --> 58:43.420
Okay. I wanna run
full diagnostics on the system.

58:43.491 --> 58:45.254
[speaking Cantonese]

58:45.330 --> 58:47.217
This is completely unnecessary.

58:48.407 --> 58:50.248
[speaking Cantonese]

59:16.738 --> 59:17.943
[guard] Up, up,

59:18.057 --> 59:19.182
Okay.

59:34.640 --> 59:35.686
[exhales]

59:37.118 --> 59:39.244
Ah!

59:39.316 --> 59:41.714
- [speaking Cantonese]
- Hey! I can walk on my own.

59:49.306 --> 59:50.874
Whoa!

59:50.944 --> 59:52.467
- [grunting]
- [speaking Cantonese]

59:52.542 --> 59:53.542
Sorry.

01:00:11.284 --> 01:00:12.364
Hey!

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.330
I can do that myself.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.685
We just met, man.

01:00:16.758 --> 01:00:18.122
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

01:00:30.345 --> 01:00:31.345
Hey!

01:00:31.423 --> 01:00:32.423
[whistles]

01:00:32.502 --> 01:00:34.980
My eyes are up here, man.

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.509
- How do you like it?
- [gasps]

01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:43.935
[coughs]

01:00:56.039 --> 01:00:57.721
[speaking Cantonese]

01:00:59.036 --> 01:01:00.116
[Atlas] Hey, I'm good.

01:01:01.833 --> 01:01:02.833
Turn around.

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:07.597
[guards speaking Cantonese]

01:01:17.897 --> 01:01:20.500
[squeaking]

01:01:20.974 --> 01:01:22.213
Do you have anything?

01:01:22.293 --> 01:01:23.975
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:27.688
- I'm good.
- They're clean.

01:01:27.807 --> 01:01:29.092
[guard speaking Cantonese]

01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:31.087
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

01:01:31.164 --> 01:01:33.482
Oh, we're walking
this way again. Yay.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:42.599
[Lula]
I don't speak the language.

01:01:48.986 --> 01:01:50.395
See?

01:01:50.464 --> 01:01:52.422
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

01:01:53.341 --> 01:01:55.865
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

01:01:57.537 --> 01:01:59.106
[speaking Cantonese]

01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:06.335
[Atlas exclaims]

01:02:11.803 --> 01:02:15.520
Something about a big white dance floor,
makes me wanna boogie.

01:02:15.639 --> 01:02:17.878
Hey, thanks for having us.

01:02:18.436 --> 01:02:20.357
That's great stuff.

01:02:21.553 --> 01:02:22.997
[speaking Cantonese]

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.072
[beeps]

01:02:26.468 --> 01:02:27.707
[chuckles] Okay.

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:30.264
You guys are pretty serious
about your security, huh?

01:02:33.701 --> 01:02:35.303
- [speaking Cantonese]
- [Atlas] Okay.

01:02:35.379 --> 01:02:38.823
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in with more stuff.

01:02:38.896 --> 01:02:41.544
- Did I come in with more stuff?
- [speaking Cantonese]

01:02:41.613 --> 01:02:43.773
- You don't think so?
- [beeps]

01:02:45.969 --> 01:02:48.492
Uh, sir, I think you
still have my wallet.

01:02:48.566 --> 01:02:51.215
Remember, I, uh, gave it
to you when I came in?

01:02:51.283 --> 01:02:53.443
It would be nice to leave with it.

01:02:58.276 --> 01:02:59.276
Wallet coming through.

01:03:00.075 --> 01:03:01.279
[metallic clang]

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:04.600
[alarm blaring]

01:03:07.148 --> 01:03:08.750
Sorry, my belt.

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.984
- [Lula] Uh...
- [beeps]

01:03:16.099 --> 01:03:18.065
I guess that's everything, right?

01:03:18.137 --> 01:03:19.216
Thank you.

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.819
- That is not a toy, Buffy.
- Sorry.

01:03:27.048 --> 01:03:28.616
Go, go, go!

01:03:32.602 --> 01:03:35.080
[tires screeching]

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.001
[Atlas] All right.
Drop me off at the market

01:03:37.078 --> 01:03:38.840
so I can get this to the Eye.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.171
You asked me to call you
when they started

01:03:40.194 --> 01:03:42.274
running around like headless chickens.

01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:44.721
Well, that's what's happening.

01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:46.709
[scoffs]

01:03:59.495 --> 01:04:02.144
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

01:04:02.212 --> 01:04:06.009
No, this is where my sources said
we might find an answer.

01:04:07.128 --> 01:04:08.776
[bell dinging]

01:04:10.484 --> 01:04:11.814
[speaking Mandarin]

01:04:17.157 --> 01:04:18.920
She must be familiar with your work.

01:04:18.996 --> 01:04:20.405
Excuse me.

01:04:20.514 --> 01:04:23.674
Miss, have you seen these people?

01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:27.956
[both speaking Mandarin]

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.745
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

01:04:36.818 --> 01:04:38.023
He's in the back.

01:04:38.656 --> 01:04:39.861
What?

01:04:39.975 --> 01:04:41.816
No "Wow, you speak Mandarin"?

01:04:41.933 --> 01:04:43.501
[speaking Mandarin]

01:04:46.408 --> 01:04:47.852
[chuckling]

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:50.165
[speaking Mandarin]

01:05:13.461 --> 01:05:15.621
Ah! The Coffin to the Beyond.

01:05:15.699 --> 01:05:16.984
[chuckles]

01:05:17.097 --> 01:05:21.621
It was always a flap,
or a trap or mirrors.

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:26.250
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

01:05:27.287 --> 01:05:30.208
But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

01:05:41.873 --> 01:05:46.590
I believe that's the prototype
for the one your father had made.

01:05:46.668 --> 01:05:49.987
He, like many others over the years,
ordered his supplies from here.

01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:53.910
Ah! [snaps fingers]
Of course.

01:05:53.981 --> 01:05:57.698
That's why you gave me the look
when I said they were in Macau.

01:05:57.777 --> 01:05:59.982
Your father used to come here
when you were young.

01:06:00.054 --> 01:06:01.782
Can I please get some space here?

01:06:07.008 --> 01:06:11.053
If you think you're the only one who'd
wondered for 30 years what happened...

01:06:11.483 --> 01:06:13.131
...you're not.

01:06:13.201 --> 01:06:15.520
Lionel was a master magician.

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:17.127
Either he gamed the hinges,

01:06:17.197 --> 01:06:20.721
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

01:06:20.794 --> 01:06:24.636
or he had access to the lock
from the inside so he could pick it.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:29.393
Word is the safe was made
from cheap metal, and it bowed.

01:06:29.465 --> 01:06:35.102
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

01:06:35.179 --> 01:06:41.783
Unless he'd reached the limit of
his capabilities and his clock ran out.

01:06:41.853 --> 01:06:43.296
[breathes shakily]

01:06:46.568 --> 01:06:51.091
Excuse me. My grandmother
has something you might want.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.078
This was your father's.

01:06:57.157 --> 01:06:59.362
He had several of these made.

01:07:03.111 --> 01:07:04.521
[speaking Mandarin]

01:07:18.736 --> 01:07:20.384
And the Horsemen?

01:07:21.293 --> 01:07:23.419
I overheard them talking.

01:07:23.491 --> 01:07:27.969
One of them, Atlas, he's meeting
someone at the market nearby.

01:07:45.189 --> 01:07:46.792
[Cowan] As for former Agent Rhodes,

01:07:46.868 --> 01:07:49.471
his location is now
your number one priority.

01:07:49.545 --> 01:07:51.705
We're putting out an international APB.

01:07:51.783 --> 01:07:54.545
We have Interpol, including cooperation
from local authorities.

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.859
Agent Cowan.

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:59.542
I'm assuming it was actually not you
who walked into Newburgh Federal Prison,

01:07:59.615 --> 01:08:02.536
then walked out 30 minutes later
with Thaddeus Bradley?

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:04.533
- What?
- He used your ID.

01:08:08.606 --> 01:08:10.572
What are you doing, Rhodes?

01:08:11.683 --> 01:08:13.012
[indistinct chatter]

01:08:38.015 --> 01:08:40.062
- Atlas, hey.
- Dylan.

01:08:40.134 --> 01:08:41.709
- I blew it, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

01:08:41.733 --> 01:08:42.970
I'm here to help now.

01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:44.386
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:45.694
I know I messed up, all right?

01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:47.343
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

01:08:47.367 --> 01:08:49.732
- Where is everybody?
- Where is everybody?

01:08:49.805 --> 01:08:51.499
I can't be seen with you,
actually, right now.

01:08:51.523 --> 01:08:53.488
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.175
the time to take control
for a little while.

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:56.933
- Hey, I'm actually... Yeah?
- Yeah, but I got it now, all right?

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:58.002
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:08:58.076 --> 01:08:59.491
You look like you can
get some rest, buddy.

01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:01.992
- Who you meeting here?
- I'm not meeting anybody.

01:09:02.072 --> 01:09:03.607
They told me at long's
you were meeting somebody.

01:09:03.631 --> 01:09:05.551
At long's?
[chuckles]

01:09:05.629 --> 01:09:08.435
Okay, yeah, no, I am, um...

01:09:08.506 --> 01:09:10.904
I'm meeting somebody from the Eye.

01:09:10.983 --> 01:09:12.261
Yeah, no, they agreed to meet me

01:09:12.301 --> 01:09:15.303
to exchange this computer chip
for our lives back.

01:09:15.379 --> 01:09:16.658
So that's what it's come to now.

01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:18.551
I hope you're happy
with the situation you've put us in.

01:09:18.576 --> 01:09:20.099
You're talking to the Eye?

01:09:20.174 --> 01:09:21.254
Yeah.

01:09:21.332 --> 01:09:23.174
Why are you talking to the Eye?

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:27.136
Atlas.
Atlas, give me the stick.

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:29.492
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay?

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:32.212
You're not our hero.
You're not FBI.

01:09:32.282 --> 01:09:35.249
You're not a magician.
You're not really anything.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:38.160
And we trusted you for a year.

01:09:38.236 --> 01:09:40.689
So if you really wanna help us...
If you really... [clears throat]

01:09:40.714 --> 01:09:43.317
If you really wanna help us,
you would leave.

01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:45.879
[scoffs]

01:09:51.743 --> 01:09:55.027
I get it. Cool. Bye.

01:10:12.682 --> 01:10:13.886
Hello, hello!

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.768
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

01:10:17.237 --> 01:10:20.204
So much fun though, knowing you'd be
scurrying away from me at the lab

01:10:20.274 --> 01:10:21.718
just to bring it to me here.

01:10:21.792 --> 01:10:23.441
Did you actually think I'd let you go?

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:26.193
- How did you do that?
- Everyone has their button.

01:10:26.268 --> 01:10:30.269
You push it and they go blind.
And yours, obviously, is ego.

01:10:30.344 --> 01:10:31.832
"Stay the course.

01:10:31.902 --> 01:10:34.665
<i>Great changes are in store.</i>

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:37.263
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

01:10:37.337 --> 01:10:38.905
will not go unrecognized."

01:10:40.174 --> 01:10:41.618
- That was you.
- Yeah.

01:10:41.693 --> 01:10:43.216
Merritt downloaded all the files,

01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:46.019
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

01:10:46.088 --> 01:10:47.168
Your phone.

01:10:49.085 --> 01:10:51.051
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

01:10:51.123 --> 01:10:54.283
What you actually put your phone on
was a bi-wave siphon pad.

01:10:55.798 --> 01:11:00.004
Once again,
science beats magic.

01:11:00.474 --> 01:11:02.758
- So, the stick?
- No.

01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:05.035
[groaning]

01:11:05.868 --> 01:11:06.868
I got it!

01:11:06.947 --> 01:11:08.391
I got it. I got it.

01:11:10.424 --> 01:11:12.311
- Fuck, Dylan!
- Wait, leave them!

01:11:12.382 --> 01:11:13.876
You really think
I'm gonna walk away from you?

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.980
- Give me the stick!
- [groans]

01:11:16.098 --> 01:11:17.178
Give me it!

01:11:17.257 --> 01:11:20.224
All right.
Don't ever question me again. Beat it!

01:11:21.932 --> 01:11:23.535
[pounding on door]

01:11:31.043 --> 01:11:33.521
- So, the stick.
- Go to hell.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.360
[scoffs] Boys.

01:11:35.439 --> 01:11:37.007
[panicked shouting]

01:11:41.353 --> 01:11:42.478
[grunting]

01:11:47.826 --> 01:11:49.747
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:11:49.824 --> 01:11:50.904
[groans]

01:12:06.048 --> 01:12:07.458
[Walter]
There's like 10 of you.

01:12:07.527 --> 01:12:09.334
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

01:12:09.405 --> 01:12:11.292
He's there! Go!

01:12:38.815 --> 01:12:40.656
- [rabbit squeaks]
- [crowd laughing]

01:12:41.413 --> 01:12:42.538
[yelps]

01:12:59.914 --> 01:13:00.994
Oh...

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.783
[laughs]

01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:34.680
[groaning]

01:13:34.759 --> 01:13:39.556
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly.
And sleep.

01:13:39.914 --> 01:13:43.199
- Doesn't work on me.
- Not even as a distraction?

01:13:43.271 --> 01:13:44.431
- [metal clanks]
- [groans]

01:13:45.908 --> 01:13:48.512
- Good job.
- Nice to be involved.

01:13:48.585 --> 01:13:50.473
[Chase chuckles]

01:13:56.777 --> 01:13:58.823
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

01:13:58.895 --> 01:14:01.588
- I just saw Dylan, something happened.
- What do you mean you just saw Dylan?

01:14:01.612 --> 01:14:03.658
Dylan's here?
What happened?

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:06.208
- Atlas.
- [stammers] I don't know.

01:14:11.043 --> 01:14:12.203
[Jack] What are they doing?

01:14:12.282 --> 01:14:14.725
[Atlas]
Those are Walter's men.

01:14:14.799 --> 01:14:17.845
This is what they want.
[sighs]

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:20.121
What the hell?
How do you still have that?

01:14:20.194 --> 01:14:21.842
[machine whirring]

01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:26.876
Whoa. That's Lionel Shrike's safe.

01:14:26.947 --> 01:14:29.471
What the hell
do they want with that?

01:14:29.544 --> 01:14:31.307
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

01:14:31.383 --> 01:14:34.701
[Atlas] They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

01:14:37.137 --> 01:14:39.024
[Dylan breathing heavily]

01:14:39.095 --> 01:14:40.334
[Dylan] What do you want?

01:14:40.414 --> 01:14:45.051
You to understand something
very important.

01:14:45.129 --> 01:14:48.369
We are mirror images.

01:14:48.446 --> 01:14:49.775
You see, because like you,

01:14:49.844 --> 01:14:52.083
I share a very deep connection
with my father.

01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:58.397
And like you, I'll stop at nothing
to avenge any wrongs done to him.

01:14:58.515 --> 01:15:00.515
- [punching]
- [Dylan groans]

01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:06.628
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

01:15:06.707 --> 01:15:08.594
Mine's still alive.

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:10.509
Get him up.

01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:28.330
So, this is the man

01:15:28.406 --> 01:15:31.485
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.799
I wouldn't have known your face

01:15:35.878 --> 01:15:39.357
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:43.117
But you have spent, what,
30 years thinking about mine?

01:15:43.191 --> 01:15:44.475
When my father died,

01:15:44.549 --> 01:15:46.675
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

01:15:46.747 --> 01:15:48.122
- I wouldn't even have known...
- She died a pauper!

01:15:48.146 --> 01:15:49.987
...who your mother was.

01:15:50.064 --> 01:15:54.667
She was a digit, a nanobyte
in a stream of data.

01:15:54.739 --> 01:15:56.705
Because nothing is personal to you

01:15:56.777 --> 01:15:59.111
and everyone and everything
is just a number, isn't that so?

01:15:59.135 --> 01:16:01.738
That is where you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

01:16:01.812 --> 01:16:06.734
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

01:16:08.006 --> 01:16:09.847
- My son...
- Yeah, the sociopath.

01:16:09.924 --> 01:16:14.481
Funny thing is, I have seven
so-called legitimate children.

01:16:14.559 --> 01:16:17.605
Sniveling, snobbish, stupid runts.

01:16:17.676 --> 01:16:21.643
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

01:16:21.712 --> 01:16:24.077
The point is,
he wants something,

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:29.311
and like any good parent, I will
stop at nothing to get it for him.

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:31.112
Your Horsemen have it.

01:16:31.223 --> 01:16:35.507
You will turn it and them
over to us, now.

01:16:35.578 --> 01:16:36.658
No.

01:16:37.736 --> 01:16:40.340
[groaning]

01:16:40.413 --> 01:16:43.176
[Walter] Dylan, I would like you
to really take this moment in

01:16:43.251 --> 01:16:46.649
because this is the consequence
of your personal vendetta come to life

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:48.489
and staring you in the face.

01:16:48.565 --> 01:16:50.328
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

01:16:50.403 --> 01:16:51.449
we're not going to stop.

01:16:51.522 --> 01:16:53.648
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.925
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

01:16:55.998 --> 01:16:57.885
Now then, cast your mind back

01:16:57.956 --> 01:17:01.082
to standing by the banks of the river
watching your father descend,

01:17:01.153 --> 01:17:03.153
disgraced and discredited.

01:17:03.231 --> 01:17:05.993
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:10.032
I felt that same thing two years ago

01:17:10.104 --> 01:17:13.230
as you drained not just my father's
fortune, but his dignity!

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.780
And yet you took pleasure from it.

01:17:18.615 --> 01:17:21.219
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

01:17:30.084 --> 01:17:31.164
[groans]

01:17:46.747 --> 01:17:48.509
[pounding on door]

01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:50.426
- Would you like some tea?
- Oh. Thank you.

01:17:50.503 --> 01:17:51.583
[muffled grunting]

01:18:06.128 --> 01:18:08.412
- You ready?
- Over to you.

01:18:15.398 --> 01:18:16.444
Splash!

01:18:16.917 --> 01:18:18.077
[chuckling]

01:18:19.994 --> 01:18:21.357
Job done!

01:18:36.977 --> 01:18:40.375
[Tressler] Hell is going to
seem like a day at the spa

01:18:40.453 --> 01:18:42.931
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:45.659
- Wouldn't you say?
- You had me at "hell."

01:18:45.728 --> 01:18:47.217
[muffled screaming]

01:19:02.551 --> 01:19:04.916
- [gasping]
- [Lionel] <i>I love you so much.</i>

01:19:04.989 --> 01:19:07.432
[yelling in frustration]

01:19:07.506 --> 01:19:09.905
Always keep something up my sleeve.

01:19:09.984 --> 01:19:11.666
[panting]

01:20:08.086 --> 01:20:09.449
[clicking]

01:20:26.148 --> 01:20:28.546
[sighs]

01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:31.671
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

01:20:31.742 --> 01:20:35.823
one speck of remorse,
but I can't.

01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:42.342
So I'll stick to the business at hand
and try not to smile too broadly.

01:20:42.411 --> 01:20:47.731
And, uh, thank you for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

01:20:48.525 --> 01:20:50.252
I take it it's done.

01:20:51.562 --> 01:20:53.528
Literally hit the bottom.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:59.883
- Now, where are the Horsemen?
- They're performers.

01:20:59.954 --> 01:21:05.512
Their pride, their ego, their need
to be adored are all too powerful

01:21:05.588 --> 01:21:07.475
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

01:21:07.546 --> 01:21:13.025
If they don't make themselves known,
you will find yourself

01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:17.108
in a very similar position
to Mr. Rhodes.

01:21:17.176 --> 01:21:21.019
- Are we clear about that?
- As clear as the water he's under.

01:21:28.485 --> 01:21:32.043
You'll have the rest
when I have the Horsemen.

01:22:04.289 --> 01:22:05.335
[all] Dylan!

01:22:06.807 --> 01:22:09.125
[Jack]
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

01:22:09.204 --> 01:22:10.409
- Dylan.
- Dylan?

01:22:10.483 --> 01:22:12.563
- [Merritt] Dylan, come on!
- [coughing]

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.682
[Dylan panting]

01:22:16.837 --> 01:22:19.565
- You're okay.
- [sighing]

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:22.316
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

01:22:22.431 --> 01:22:26.035
- Are you all right, bro?
- Okay!

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:28.073
- Thank you!
- This is the least I could do.

01:22:28.145 --> 01:22:30.119
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

01:22:30.143 --> 01:22:31.473
That was not an option.

01:22:31.542 --> 01:22:33.429
You took a bullet for us, it was huge.

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.341
You really did, man.

01:22:38.135 --> 01:22:39.818
Thanks for pulling me out.
Seriously.

01:22:40.773 --> 01:22:42.136
[softly] Yeah.

01:22:42.211 --> 01:22:44.337
[Lula] You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

01:22:44.409 --> 01:22:46.648
Literally, in my case,
I was just standing on the shore

01:22:46.727 --> 01:22:48.101
while Atlas jumped down and got you.

01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:49.649
- [chuckling]
- I'm serious.

01:22:50.243 --> 01:22:52.130
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:53.929
- What's wrong?
- [Lula] What?

01:22:55.518 --> 01:22:57.837
- It's fake.
- What?

01:22:59.594 --> 01:23:01.117
[Lula] No, I had the stick.

01:23:01.192 --> 01:23:03.841
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand,

01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:06.433
in the lab, and then I put it in
the little case thing.

01:23:06.507 --> 01:23:08.681
- And I gave it to Atlas.
- Right, which I then gave to Dylan.

01:23:08.705 --> 01:23:11.228
Is there any chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

01:23:11.302 --> 01:23:14.667
No, I took it from you
and then slipped it back in your coat

01:23:14.739 --> 01:23:16.501
when I pushed you out.

01:23:16.577 --> 01:23:19.783
Either way, we're left holding
a whole sack full of nada.

01:23:19.854 --> 01:23:22.457
Yeah, but they're gonna come after us
as if we do have something.

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:25.896
No. Okay. I agree that somebody
got the better of us. Okay? Somehow.

01:23:25.968 --> 01:23:28.366
But I don't agree
that we have a sack full of nada.

01:23:28.445 --> 01:23:31.605
Because we're all here.
That's a sack full of something.

01:23:32.601 --> 01:23:39.284
Listen, we all know that Walter is not
going to stop until he gets that chip.

01:23:39.354 --> 01:23:42.912
And we're the only ones
that even know that he's alive.

01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:47.594
We can't just walk away.
That's not what the Horsemen do.

01:23:50.383 --> 01:23:52.190
There's a quote. Um...

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:53.671
It's actually by the magician

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.538
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

01:23:55.578 --> 01:23:57.499
It's, uh...

01:23:57.576 --> 01:24:04.259
"A magician's greatest power lies
forever shrouded in his empty fist."

01:24:04.329 --> 01:24:06.648
"And the very idea
that he can convince the world

01:24:06.727 --> 01:24:09.887
that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

01:24:09.963 --> 01:24:12.805
- That's Lionel Shrike.
- Right.

01:24:14.039 --> 01:24:15.174
[Jack] So what are you saying?

01:24:15.198 --> 01:24:18.404
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

01:24:21.472 --> 01:24:24.871
- What is Walter's greatest fear?
- Being seen.

01:24:24.948 --> 01:24:28.949
- And what does the stick do?
- The stick can unencode anything.

01:24:29.024 --> 01:24:33.946
It can open up a back door
into any computer on the planet.

01:24:34.019 --> 01:24:36.019
- Including his.
- Yeah.

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:40.099
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

01:24:40.173 --> 01:24:44.254
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:47.694
We need a plan.
But we don't have time.

01:24:47.806 --> 01:24:51.249
We have each other
and there are five of us.

01:24:51.322 --> 01:24:54.243
But we also need supplies, right?
And resources.

01:24:54.319 --> 01:24:57.604
And probably more than five people.

01:24:57.676 --> 01:25:01.563
Do you really think
you don't have help?

01:25:01.632 --> 01:25:04.394
Oh, she speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:09.868
Do you know why the Fool is
the most powerful card in the tarot?

01:25:09.943 --> 01:25:13.581
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:18.104
He's a fool because he's a clean slate,

01:25:18.175 --> 01:25:22.096
and, therefore, can become anything.

01:25:22.171 --> 01:25:23.456
You were chosen.

01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:26.056
All of you.

01:25:26.127 --> 01:25:31.333
Not because of who you are,
but because of who you might become.

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.803
When you say "chosen"...
Are you part of the Eye?

01:25:36.876 --> 01:25:40.922
Yes. We are part of the Eye.

01:25:40.992 --> 01:25:44.198
You've each doubted our existence.

01:25:45.028 --> 01:25:49.348
Wondering if we,
indeed, were watching.

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:56.578
We are.
We always have been.

01:25:56.657 --> 01:25:59.180
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:01.459
- You know what she's saying, right?
- Yes.

01:26:01.532 --> 01:26:03.930
That now we have
resources and help.

01:26:05.728 --> 01:26:07.091
[softly] Thank you.

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:11.246
So, who's in?

01:26:15.038 --> 01:26:17.642
- I'm in.
- Yeah, I'm in.

01:26:20.473 --> 01:26:21.473
Let's do this.

01:26:23.869 --> 01:26:25.472
[all speaking Mandarin]

01:26:32.501 --> 01:26:33.661
[cell phone chimes]

01:26:39.174 --> 01:26:40.856
[softly] No, no, no.

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.616
<i>Not long ago, we were tricked.</i>

01:26:45.688 --> 01:26:48.609
<i>I was exposed
and brought back from the dead.</i>

01:26:48.685 --> 01:26:51.526
[Lula] <i>So we thought it was only fitting
that we do the same thing</i>

01:26:51.602 --> 01:26:55.966
<i>- to the person who did it to us.
- Midnight, New Year's Eve. London.</i>

01:26:56.037 --> 01:26:59.277
<i>We will be performing a series of shows
that all connect to our big finale,</i>

01:26:59.354 --> 01:27:01.514
<i>so pay close attention to each trick.</i>

01:27:01.592 --> 01:27:02.672
Get my father.

01:27:04.828 --> 01:27:05.908
Run!

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:09.147
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

01:27:09.264 --> 01:27:10.503
What do we know about Rhodes?

01:27:10.583 --> 01:27:12.424
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:13.626
Let's get to the airport.

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:16.153
[Merritt] <i>So leave your kiddies
at home and get ready for a wild night,</i>

01:27:16.177 --> 01:27:19.257
<i>because we, too, will bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:21.141
Let's move, everyone!

01:27:21.212 --> 01:27:23.146
[Atlas] <i>In front of
the largest stage in the world...</i>

01:27:23.170 --> 01:27:25.091
<i>The actual world.</i>

01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:28.930
You know they're playing you, right?
Leading you into a trap?

01:27:29.004 --> 01:27:30.653
Yeah, but the threat is real.

01:27:30.762 --> 01:27:33.411
This card can hack into any system
on the planet, including ours.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.719
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

01:27:35.797 --> 01:27:37.286
Me. Everything we've done.

01:27:37.356 --> 01:27:39.402
Is it real, Mr. McKinney?

01:27:46.786 --> 01:27:48.025
The threat is real.

01:27:48.105 --> 01:27:50.390
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

01:27:50.463 --> 01:27:52.827
[Chase] We need to get
to London by midnight.

01:28:01.532 --> 01:28:03.106
[female reporter 1]
<i>We are here in London</i>

01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:05.608
<i>on this New Year's Eve,
and the crowds are out in force.</i>

01:28:05.688 --> 01:28:07.222
[male reporter 1]
<i>Locals and tourists alike</i>

01:28:07.246 --> 01:28:09.372
<i>getting ready for
the party of the year.</i>

01:28:09.444 --> 01:28:11.418
<i>[female reporter</i> 2]
<i>A video gone viral from the infamous</i>

01:28:11.442 --> 01:28:13.283
<i>Horsemen magicians has surfaced.</i>

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.094
[male reporter 2] <i>They promise
to make a grand reappearance.</i>

01:28:15.118 --> 01:28:18.198
[male reporter 1] <i>But will it end in
their arrest on national television?</i>

01:28:18.275 --> 01:28:19.957
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

01:28:20.033 --> 01:28:22.113
<i>Who knows where they'll show up...</i>

01:28:22.191 --> 01:28:23.646
[female reporter 1]
<i>But we do know, wherever,</i>

01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:26.795
<i>whenever that is,
people will be watching.</i>

01:28:28.505 --> 01:28:30.426
Yeah, texts, tweets, Instagrams.

01:28:30.503 --> 01:28:33.470
Anything that says "Horsemen,"
brags about seeing the Horsemen,

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:35.222
tag them and bundle them.

01:28:35.298 --> 01:28:37.663
Dad, who do we have security-wise
on this? Your guys?

01:28:37.735 --> 01:28:38.895
Whoever you want.

01:28:39.014 --> 01:28:40.892
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

01:28:40.972 --> 01:28:43.066
Anyone who wants to work
stationed throughout the city,

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:44.897
so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

01:28:44.968 --> 01:28:46.457
[tires screeching]

01:28:47.646 --> 01:28:48.930
[man playing drums]

01:28:59.154 --> 01:29:01.439
- Hello! Hey!
- [crowd cheers]

01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:05.152
My name's Jack Wilder.

01:29:05.987 --> 01:29:07.953
Goddamn, it feels good to be back.

01:29:08.025 --> 01:29:11.629
- [cameras clicking]
- All right, gather around. Indulge me.

01:29:11.701 --> 01:29:13.906
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

01:29:13.979 --> 01:29:17.866
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:22.255
Trick performed by street hustlers all
over the world. And why street hustlers?

01:29:22.331 --> 01:29:25.218
Because as soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

01:29:25.288 --> 01:29:27.254
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

01:29:28.125 --> 01:29:29.614
[all cheer]

01:29:29.723 --> 01:29:33.849
While we're at it,
let's find ourselves a life-sized Queen.

01:29:33.919 --> 01:29:35.840
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

01:29:39.154 --> 01:29:41.519
Don't worry. I promise you
there's a 50 percent chance

01:29:41.592 --> 01:29:42.926
you'll get her back after the show.

01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:44.757
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

01:29:44.828 --> 01:29:48.352
All right. Let's find ourselves
some Jacks to serve our Queen!

01:29:48.425 --> 01:29:49.709
[Chase] <i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

01:29:49.783 --> 01:29:53.546
I know how these guys work now.
They're gonna start with a tease.

01:29:53.619 --> 01:29:55.586
A few little pop-ups.

01:29:55.657 --> 01:29:58.545
<i>Something to lure you in. Like...</i>

01:29:58.614 --> 01:30:02.740
Well, you know, like Three Card Monte,
where the guy goes,

01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:05.379
"Looky here, but no, no, looky here!"

01:30:05.448 --> 01:30:09.369
<i>Except when all these
little tricks are done,</i>

01:30:09.444 --> 01:30:11.524
<i>the only thing
you're gonna be looking at</i>

01:30:11.601 --> 01:30:15.602
is the inside of your own colon,
with the words

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:18.598
<i>"Horsemen" written all over it.</i>

01:30:19.314 --> 01:30:20.882
In blood.

01:30:20.952 --> 01:30:24.431
We get the picture, Mr. McKinney.

01:30:24.509 --> 01:30:26.555
And get out of my chair.

01:30:26.626 --> 01:30:28.831
[Lula] Hello, everybody!

01:30:28.904 --> 01:30:30.870
- Come close, come on!
- [applause]

01:30:30.942 --> 01:30:32.863
All right, all right, so listen.

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:38.419
Tonight, I am going to make
something fly using actual magic.

01:30:38.495 --> 01:30:40.257
- Are you ready?
- [all] Yeah!

01:30:40.333 --> 01:30:43.379
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

01:30:43.450 --> 01:30:47.814
I'm gonna make it fly over there
and land on the Thames.

01:30:47.885 --> 01:30:49.726
Can you handle that?

01:30:49.803 --> 01:30:51.327
[Jack]
Same rules apply as before.

01:30:51.402 --> 01:30:53.482
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

01:30:53.559 --> 01:30:54.923
It's as simple as that.

01:30:54.998 --> 01:30:56.725
- Are you guys ready?
- [all] Yeah!

01:30:56.796 --> 01:30:58.240
[Walter] Dad, look at this.

01:30:59.593 --> 01:31:00.968
Tag this one.
Where does it come from?

01:31:00.992 --> 01:31:03.118
Near the river.
Looks like the shows are starting.

01:31:03.190 --> 01:31:04.764
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

01:31:04.788 --> 01:31:06.427
- What do you mean?
- It's on Channel One.

01:31:14.658 --> 01:31:15.913
- [Austin] Let's go to 2.
- [Cowan] Here we go.

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:18.540
Got him. We have a location.

01:31:18.614 --> 01:31:20.580
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

01:31:20.652 --> 01:31:22.618
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

01:31:22.690 --> 01:31:24.418
Typing in grid coordinates now.

01:31:26.207 --> 01:31:28.855
Turn around.
Hide yourselves with the cards.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:32.689
And here we go. Switch!

01:31:34.159 --> 01:31:36.333
You guys still have your eye on her?
You want me to go back and do it?

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:39.437
Okay, all right. I'm moving on.
And switch.

01:31:41.432 --> 01:31:42.478
Where is she?

01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:43.755
[crowd shouting]

01:31:43.829 --> 01:31:45.875
Down at the end?
You sure?

01:31:45.947 --> 01:31:48.754
All right, can I get a drumroll
from my man in the back?

01:31:48.824 --> 01:31:50.745
- [drumroll]
- Thank you very much.

01:31:51.981 --> 01:31:53.504
- Uh-oh.
- [crowd gasps]

01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:55.384
Uh-oh.

01:31:56.656 --> 01:31:59.134
- There's my girl.
- [laughs]

01:31:59.214 --> 01:32:01.817
[stammers]
Not my girl, 100 percent your girl.

01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:03.261
But just in this situation.

01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:05.978
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

01:32:06.047 --> 01:32:09.934
So, uh, let me just
make something small fly, like...

01:32:10.003 --> 01:32:12.129
Fly, fly, fly!

01:32:12.201 --> 01:32:15.599
Wow, right? Look at that!
Aw. Come on, people.

01:32:15.717 --> 01:32:18.604
Tough crowd. You, fly!

01:32:18.674 --> 01:32:19.799
- Me?
- Check your fly.

01:32:20.992 --> 01:32:22.594
[crowd gasps]

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.909
- [applause]
- You like that?

01:32:24.988 --> 01:32:26.875
You support that relationship?

01:32:26.946 --> 01:32:29.833
That guy had a bird in his pants.
That's disgusting.

01:32:33.499 --> 01:32:35.593
[dispatcher] <i>Copy that.
We've got two sightings reported.</i>

01:32:35.617 --> 01:32:38.538
<i>- Heading to Greenwich Market.</i>
- Get me Thaddeus.

01:32:38.614 --> 01:32:40.899
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.
They're moving.</i>

01:32:41.012 --> 01:32:44.092
Let 'em move.
That's what the Horsemen want.

01:32:44.169 --> 01:32:45.903
Well, what if they get there first?
That can't happen.

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:48.053
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

01:32:48.125 --> 01:32:49.330
Find the pattern.

01:32:50.283 --> 01:32:53.250
You do that, and you'll be able
to cut them off

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.718
<i>before they get to their final trick.</i>

01:32:55.797 --> 01:32:59.514
If it makes you feel better,
I'll take care of the FBI.

01:33:01.551 --> 01:33:03.551
[indistinct chatter]

01:33:08.584 --> 01:33:09.948
[crowd cheering]

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:15.224
OK, well, I guess you found me!

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:16.866
We've got a third spot.

01:33:16.936 --> 01:33:19.459
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

01:33:21.811 --> 01:33:26.892
Urn... Give me two, 13 and 21.

01:33:27.965 --> 01:33:30.852
What the hell is that?
Freeze that and zoom in.

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.722
How the hell did this happen?

01:33:35.837 --> 01:33:38.963
He's dead. We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

01:33:39.034 --> 01:33:41.557
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

01:33:41.631 --> 01:33:42.686
what are we gonna do about it?

01:33:42.710 --> 01:33:44.472
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

01:33:44.548 --> 01:33:45.628
Where's my coat?

01:33:45.707 --> 01:33:48.435
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

01:33:48.504 --> 01:33:50.063
[Walter] Oh, I know
where they're going.

01:33:50.103 --> 01:33:52.706
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:54.190
Chase, you need
to get to him

01:33:54.259 --> 01:33:56.313
so we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

01:33:56.337 --> 01:33:58.099
[tires screeching]

01:34:02.091 --> 01:34:05.728
I have a confession to make. I've been
told I have some control issues.

01:34:05.847 --> 01:34:09.166
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

01:34:09.244 --> 01:34:13.165
so I'm gonna try to control something
that's a lot easier than people.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.678
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

01:34:14.718 --> 01:34:17.480
- [laughing]
- Yeah, rain, um...

01:34:18.994 --> 01:34:20.688
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

01:34:20.712 --> 01:34:23.474
That would be something
that only God can do, right?

01:34:23.549 --> 01:34:25.834
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

01:34:25.907 --> 01:34:28.794
I'm not just gonna make it clear up.
No, no, no.

01:34:28.864 --> 01:34:30.944
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:34.063
[crowd cheering]

01:34:36.976 --> 01:34:38.464
[crowd gasps]

01:34:44.249 --> 01:34:47.454
And can God do that?
Mmm. No, I don't think so.

01:34:47.525 --> 01:34:49.890
Or what about make it go up?

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:52.285
[crowd gasps]

01:34:57.555 --> 01:34:59.555
Are you still with me?

01:34:59.633 --> 01:35:02.679
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it. Turn around.

01:35:06.027 --> 01:35:07.152
Switch!

01:35:10.862 --> 01:35:12.022
Show me the lady.

01:35:12.101 --> 01:35:14.908
Show me the lady!

01:35:14.978 --> 01:35:16.183
The end? End?

01:35:18.654 --> 01:35:20.812
You know what?
I'm actually starting to feel kinda bad.

01:35:21.771 --> 01:35:24.897
It's just because I can actually feel
that you guys are paying attention.

01:35:24.968 --> 01:35:26.570
It's just that...

01:35:26.646 --> 01:35:30.090
You know, it's unfortunate
that it's the wrong kind of attention.

01:35:31.321 --> 01:35:33.799
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

01:35:34.998 --> 01:35:38.078
He's so cute. He's so cute!

01:35:38.155 --> 01:35:40.917
- Let's kill him, right?
- [crowd gasps]

01:35:40.992 --> 01:35:44.959
- Merritt, move into position.
- Got it, Dylan.

01:35:45.028 --> 01:35:46.710
Uh, I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

01:35:46.786 --> 01:35:49.151
Lula, stand by, all right?

01:35:49.263 --> 01:35:51.582
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.028
[crowd exclaims]

01:36:01.132 --> 01:36:03.575
[female reporter] <i>Reports are
coming in from all over London</i>

01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:07.252
<i>as the Horsemen appear to have taken
over the whole city for their show.</i>

01:36:10.282 --> 01:36:13.965
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

01:36:14.039 --> 01:36:15.373
- Please, bro, don't do this.
- Where are you headed?

01:36:15.397 --> 01:36:17.205
North, south, east?

01:36:18.075 --> 01:36:19.598
East. Tower of London?

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:22.435
Tower Bridge?
Near Tower Bridge? The Thames!

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:27.034
[chuckles] You're going to
the Thamesy-Whemsy! You're so easy!

01:36:27.106 --> 01:36:29.754
Bro, if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

01:36:29.823 --> 01:36:32.221
There's not.
Where's your entry?

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:36.097
South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich.

01:36:36.177 --> 01:36:39.780
[mocking] I know where you're going.
I know where...

01:36:41.132 --> 01:36:42.495
Watch it, hobo.

01:36:43.369 --> 01:36:45.335
[cell phone ringing]

01:36:45.407 --> 01:36:47.931
Hey, Merritt. Oh, come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

01:36:49.723 --> 01:36:51.087
When?

01:36:51.162 --> 01:36:53.810
Shit. All right. All right, I got it.

01:36:53.879 --> 01:36:55.925
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

01:36:55.997 --> 01:36:57.406
[crowd clamoring]

01:36:58.874 --> 01:37:00.556
Sorry. Just...

01:37:00.632 --> 01:37:03.110
- [grunts]
- [crowd gasps]

01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:04.364
- What? I just told you...
- [cell phone buzzing]

01:37:04.388 --> 01:37:05.388
Phone call.

01:37:06.786 --> 01:37:07.866
- Hello?
- [Dylan] <i>Lula.</i>

01:37:07.945 --> 01:37:11.309
Dylan. Ah, yeah, kind of in the middle
of something right now.

01:37:11.381 --> 01:37:13.950
<i>Wrap it up.
Meet me at the rendezvous point now.</i>

01:37:14.019 --> 01:37:15.303
- What?
<i>- Now!</i>

01:37:15.977 --> 01:37:17.943
Was that an act of God?

01:37:18.055 --> 01:37:21.135
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

01:37:21.211 --> 01:37:24.371
And the strobe lights
and rain machines.

01:37:24.448 --> 01:37:26.369
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

01:37:26.446 --> 01:37:28.660
Because you're gonna need to know
all of that for the final.

01:37:28.684 --> 01:37:30.048
[all cheering]

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:35.280
So how did I do it?
Did I use a Barry Trap?

01:37:35.357 --> 01:37:37.676
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

01:37:37.755 --> 01:37:38.801
<i>Wham Jack, go now!</i>

01:37:38.874 --> 01:37:39.969
You know what?
I hate to say it.

01:37:39.993 --> 01:37:41.791
You're gonna have to wait to find out.
I know.

01:37:41.831 --> 01:37:44.229
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

01:37:45.147 --> 01:37:46.352
[all cheering]

01:37:47.665 --> 01:37:48.745
[Dylan] <i>Lula, go!</i>

01:37:48.824 --> 01:37:50.904
[stammers]
I have to go.

01:38:04.168 --> 01:38:05.168
[all cheering]

01:38:09.763 --> 01:38:13.969
[Cowan] Out of the way, FBI!
Move, move, move! Go!

01:38:14.039 --> 01:38:15.766
Get some men in that park!

01:38:15.837 --> 01:38:16.962
Men in the park, now!

01:38:17.036 --> 01:38:19.161
[Thaddeus]
You gonna fill up on appetizers?

01:38:19.233 --> 01:38:21.882
Or save room for
the main course?

01:38:21.951 --> 01:38:23.758
Where the hell
are the Horsemen?

01:38:23.829 --> 01:38:25.068
You can chase them
all you want,

01:38:25.147 --> 01:38:27.625
you're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

01:38:28.624 --> 01:38:31.431
Or, you can let them
come to you.

01:38:31.501 --> 01:38:33.070
So, what's it gonna be?

01:38:33.179 --> 01:38:34.304
Chase them?

01:38:35.297 --> 01:38:36.661
Or make a deal with me?

01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:44.937
Again? How did we
get found out again?

01:38:45.008 --> 01:38:46.822
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

01:38:46.846 --> 01:38:48.380
- Where's Merritt?
- Fine. I don't know.

01:38:48.404 --> 01:38:49.404
I'm here.

01:38:49.483 --> 01:38:51.290
- Where's Lula?
- I'm right here!

01:38:51.361 --> 01:38:53.248
What the hell happened?

01:38:53.319 --> 01:38:55.253
- My goddamn brother happened.
- Don't worry about it.

01:38:55.277 --> 01:38:56.766
We just gotta get to the destination.

01:38:56.836 --> 01:38:58.810
- Lula, can you handle that thing?
- I can ride it.

01:38:58.834 --> 01:39:00.834
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

01:39:00.912 --> 01:39:02.150
- Yeah, good point.
- Let's go!

01:39:02.230 --> 01:39:03.310
No, Jack.

01:39:07.985 --> 01:39:08.985
Shit!

01:39:11.941 --> 01:39:13.419
[Dylan]
Jack's down. We gotta get him.

01:39:16.736 --> 01:39:17.782
Come on, move!

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:25.488
- [Atlas] Jack! Go, go!
- [Lula] That's the brake.

01:39:25.567 --> 01:39:27.169
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

01:39:27.245 --> 01:39:28.928
Come on, follow me!

01:39:30.202 --> 01:39:31.202
That's it?

01:39:35.797 --> 01:39:38.445
[groaning]

01:39:47.825 --> 01:39:49.427
- Hey, ready?
- Yeah!

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:57.586
Get on.

01:40:01.411 --> 01:40:03.537
- Yeah!
- Okay, guys, I'm coming!

01:40:03.609 --> 01:40:05.928
Whoa! Jesus!

01:40:07.365 --> 01:40:09.127
- I'm coming!
- [tires screeching]

01:40:09.203 --> 01:40:10.328
[yelping]

01:40:14.278 --> 01:40:15.517
[groaning]

01:40:17.235 --> 01:40:19.076
- [thug 1] Get up! Come on!
- Okay.

01:40:19.153 --> 01:40:20.358
[guns cocking]

01:40:20.472 --> 01:40:21.677
[groans] You got me.

01:40:21.751 --> 01:40:23.911
Those things are really dangerous!

01:40:25.667 --> 01:40:27.872
- [thug 1] Come on!
- [thug 2] Go!

01:40:29.663 --> 01:40:31.823
[thug 3]
Get him in! Move it!

01:40:36.256 --> 01:40:37.905
- [Austin] What is happening?
- [beeping]

01:40:38.014 --> 01:40:40.253
Where are they?

01:40:40.332 --> 01:40:42.332
They should be
arriving any second.

01:40:43.609 --> 01:40:46.052
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

01:40:55.237 --> 01:40:57.124
[Chase] Ah!

01:40:58.314 --> 01:41:00.713
Okay, feeling fear.

01:41:01.071 --> 01:41:03.754
Fear. Anger, anger.

01:41:04.468 --> 01:41:07.469
- Oh, full house!
- That's enough.

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:10.473
[Chase] I was done.

01:41:11.421 --> 01:41:15.502
So nice to see you all again.

01:41:15.577 --> 01:41:21.101
But since we're such old friends,
let's skip the formalities.

01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:26.853
One of you
has something we require.

01:41:28.484 --> 01:41:30.132
So give it over.

01:41:38.314 --> 01:41:40.599
Nothing at all?

01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:44.274
- Really?
- [scoffs]

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:47.476
Sit down!

01:41:51.701 --> 01:41:53.189
[brakes screeching]

01:41:54.658 --> 01:41:56.101
[Walter] Let's go, let's go!

01:41:57.335 --> 01:41:58.665
Let's go, let's go!

01:41:58.734 --> 01:42:01.337
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

01:42:01.411 --> 01:42:02.571
Get those lights off me!

01:42:08.364 --> 01:42:09.932
[Walter] Get on the plane!

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:14.120
[Lula] Ow! Hey!

01:42:16.756 --> 01:42:17.795
[Walter] Get on the plane!

01:42:27.385 --> 01:42:28.624
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

01:42:28.704 --> 01:42:30.591
Yeah, uh, take off immediately.

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:33.903
[groans]

01:42:33.978 --> 01:42:36.627
You know, you make it almost too easy?

01:42:36.696 --> 01:42:40.378
I mean, even your hilarious attempts
to make yourselves unpredictable,

01:42:40.452 --> 01:42:42.293
just follow the same pattern each time.

01:42:42.370 --> 01:42:44.370
Set up, set up, set up.

01:42:44.448 --> 01:42:45.687
[gasps] Big reveal.

01:42:45.767 --> 01:42:48.165
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

01:42:48.244 --> 01:42:50.972
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

01:42:55.876 --> 01:42:59.673
Well, there will be a big reveal,
and it will come now.

01:43:01.431 --> 01:43:04.511
The stick, dear boy.

01:43:05.067 --> 01:43:06.352
- No.
- [Walter] Fine.

01:43:06.905 --> 01:43:09.110
Start with her.

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:11.502
- [veins]
- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

01:43:13.699 --> 01:43:17.097
- Give it to him.
- Danny, give him the card.

01:43:17.175 --> 01:43:19.016
- Just give it to him.
- [Jack] Danny, come on.

01:43:29.043 --> 01:43:30.168
We'll have a closer look.

01:43:33.199 --> 01:43:35.086
[thunder rumbling]

01:43:38.634 --> 01:43:40.600
Okay, I owe you an apology.

01:43:40.672 --> 01:43:42.956
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

01:43:43.029 --> 01:43:44.684
- This is the both of us.
- Okay, it's the both of us.

01:43:44.708 --> 01:43:46.196
- Guys, come on!
- Come on, stop!

01:43:46.266 --> 01:43:49.073
- You, to save your little girlfriend!
- To save my...

01:43:49.143 --> 01:43:51.428
- He had a knife to her head!
- I'm a Horseman, you dick!

01:43:51.501 --> 01:43:52.995
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

01:43:53.019 --> 01:43:54.463
And you, what's your deal, man?

01:43:54.538 --> 01:43:56.664
Look, they're not gonna get blood
all over the seats.

01:43:56.736 --> 01:43:58.430
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

01:43:58.454 --> 01:43:59.788
- Really?
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

01:43:59.812 --> 01:44:01.938
but I just have to
say congratulations.

01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:03.215
And thank you!

01:44:04.767 --> 01:44:06.006
It's real.

01:44:06.086 --> 01:44:07.496
[Lula] What?

01:44:07.565 --> 01:44:09.088
[whispers] It's real?

01:44:10.801 --> 01:44:11.847
Bring them through.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.000
Did you say it's real?

01:44:13.079 --> 01:44:14.134
[Jack]
What is he talking about?

01:44:14.158 --> 01:44:15.363
Move!

01:44:15.437 --> 01:44:16.960
Well done, my boy.

01:44:20.831 --> 01:44:23.230
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

01:44:23.309 --> 01:44:27.435
It's the most expensive bottle on Earth.

01:44:28.344 --> 01:44:30.470
$1.2 million.

01:44:30.542 --> 01:44:34.543
And I saved it just for this occasion.

01:44:34.618 --> 01:44:38.857
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

01:44:38.933 --> 01:44:42.059
Hey. You got what you wanted.

01:44:42.130 --> 01:44:44.654
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

01:44:44.727 --> 01:44:47.649
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

01:44:47.724 --> 01:44:51.407
- You sure?
- Chase, what shall we do?

01:44:53.199 --> 01:44:55.359
Toss them out.

01:44:55.437 --> 01:44:58.005
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

01:44:58.074 --> 01:44:59.881
- [protesting]
- [operatic music playing]

01:44:59.952 --> 01:45:03.396
- No! Come on! No!
- Farewell.

01:45:03.748 --> 01:45:05.953
[Lula] Oh, God! No!

01:45:07.225 --> 01:45:09.624
Wait! I just wanna say...

01:45:09.702 --> 01:45:11.941
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.986
but I'm leaving with the right one.

01:45:14.058 --> 01:45:15.627
I love you guys!

01:45:15.696 --> 01:45:16.742
- No!
- No, no, no!

01:45:18.574 --> 01:45:21.017
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

01:45:21.091 --> 01:45:22.171
[Merritt] No!

01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:23.649
- [Merritt screams]
- [Dylan shouts]

01:45:23.688 --> 01:45:25.052
Who's next?

01:45:26.446 --> 01:45:27.571
[Dylan screams]

01:45:31.201 --> 01:45:33.042
[Lula] No, wait! Let me go!

01:45:33.119 --> 01:45:35.438
[struggling] Let go of me!

01:45:35.517 --> 01:45:37.835
No, no, no!

01:45:37.914 --> 01:45:39.597
- Let me go!
- Toss her!

01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:44.911
[laughing] Oh, God!

01:45:44.987 --> 01:45:47.988
Hurry up and shut that door!
It's getting cold in here.

01:45:48.064 --> 01:45:49.985
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

01:45:53.299 --> 01:45:54.584
[Jack screaming]

01:45:55.617 --> 01:45:56.741
No, no, no!

01:45:58.174 --> 01:46:00.413
[Chase] A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

01:46:00.492 --> 01:46:01.980
[Atlas screaming]

01:46:04.208 --> 01:46:05.208
Oh, that was fun!

01:46:08.084 --> 01:46:11.085
Cheers! Well done, my boy.

01:46:13.878 --> 01:46:14.878
[Spits]

01:46:15.597 --> 01:46:16.926
Um...

01:46:16.995 --> 01:46:19.155
No, is it supposed to taste like that?

01:46:19.273 --> 01:46:20.761
No, it is not.

01:46:38.014 --> 01:46:40.492
[engines powering down]

01:46:40.572 --> 01:46:42.140
What the hell is going on?

01:46:46.685 --> 01:46:48.811
[all laughing]

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:54.359
[Merritt]
Okay, come pick them up!

01:46:55.077 --> 01:46:56.804
- Come on.
- [Jack] Come on out.

01:47:08.544 --> 01:47:09.987
[crowd cheering]

01:47:10.062 --> 01:47:13.904
[announcer]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen... The Horsemen!</i>

01:47:13.978 --> 01:47:15.978
[cheering continues]

01:47:34.238 --> 01:47:36.477
<i>No, you should feel pretty
good about yourself, man.</i>

01:47:36.595 --> 01:47:40.119
<i>You predicted it correctly.
The Thames, stroke of midnight.</i>

01:47:40.192 --> 01:47:41.999
<i>New Year's Eve. Happy New Year!</i>

01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:44.196
[crowd cheering]

01:47:49.023 --> 01:47:50.308
Unbelievable!

01:47:50.382 --> 01:47:51.756
- We are moving now.
- The whole thing just changed.

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:54.542
- All backup into position stat!
- We're on the move.

01:47:56.016 --> 01:47:58.255
- You're staying here!
- Of course.

01:48:05.606 --> 01:48:07.448
[Austin]
Move! Move! Out of the way!

01:48:07.524 --> 01:48:09.763
[Atlas]
Wow! Thank you very much, London!

01:48:09.842 --> 01:48:14.127
We would like to acknowledge not just
our old friend, Arthur Tressler.

01:48:14.198 --> 01:48:16.766
But his young and very
brilliant son, Walter Mabry.

01:48:16.835 --> 01:48:19.234
Who has performed one of the
greatest feats of illusion

01:48:19.313 --> 01:48:20.961
even we have ever seen.

01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:25.237
He has, amazingly, brought
himself back from the dead!

01:48:25.347 --> 01:48:27.950
- [crowd laughing]
- [Merritt] But before he did that,

01:48:28.024 --> 01:48:29.388
he revealed someone.

01:48:29.463 --> 01:48:34.588
And we think it only right
to give him a proper introduction.

01:48:34.657 --> 01:48:38.658
He is our friend and he is our leader.
Dylan Shrike!

01:48:38.733 --> 01:48:40.733
- Get over here!
- [Lula] Yeah!

01:48:40.811 --> 01:48:42.335
[crowd cheering]

01:48:46.605 --> 01:48:48.651
[Dylan] So, normally

01:48:48.763 --> 01:48:53.447
only the magician, his assistant,
and a few trusted stage hands

01:48:53.518 --> 01:48:55.757
know the secret of a trick.

01:48:55.836 --> 01:48:58.837
But tonight, however, in this effect,

01:48:58.913 --> 01:49:01.993
all of you people
around the Thames here.

01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:06.707
And since we're streaming live,
everyone around the world

01:49:06.785 --> 01:49:09.309
already knows everything.

01:49:09.383 --> 01:49:13.463
And only these fellows
here are the ones left in the dark.

01:49:13.538 --> 01:49:16.459
So let's see how closely
you were watching our shows.

01:49:16.535 --> 01:49:20.253
Remember when we were playing
"Find the Lady," and I said

01:49:20.332 --> 01:49:22.253
<i>that we used a Barry Trap.</i>

01:49:23.049 --> 01:49:26.606
<i>Some classic switches
and a few duplicates?</i>

01:49:26.685 --> 01:49:30.209
<i>Well, that's how we switched
the driver of the truck.</i>

01:49:31.161 --> 01:49:33.207
[grunts]

01:49:33.279 --> 01:49:35.517
<i>Which took us to a duplicate hangar</i>

01:49:35.636 --> 01:49:38.160
<i>where we used your need to rush,</i>

01:49:38.234 --> 01:49:41.235
<i>and your fear of being seen
let you do the work for us.</i>

01:49:41.311 --> 01:49:43.118
Get those lights off me!

01:49:44.427 --> 01:49:48.667
So, the airplane.
How did we get it to fly?

01:49:49.742 --> 01:49:54.538
[Atlas] <i>Well, we used fans,
and lights and rain machines.</i>

01:49:54.617 --> 01:49:56.424
[crowd cheering]

01:49:58.014 --> 01:49:59.696
[laughing]

01:49:59.772 --> 01:50:04.409
Obviously, all of this was
reliant on us getting caught.

01:50:04.487 --> 01:50:05.772
But we needed to make sure

01:50:05.886 --> 01:50:07.966
that you would do exactly
what we needed you to do

01:50:08.044 --> 01:50:09.532
once you did catch us.

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:15.683
My brother Chase, who was
technical adviser to the losing team.

01:50:15.756 --> 01:50:18.404
He taught us that it's
all about blind spots.

01:50:18.513 --> 01:50:20.037
I know where you're going!

01:50:20.112 --> 01:50:23.715
And, uh, surprises.

01:50:25.546 --> 01:50:27.070
Watch it, hobo.

01:50:27.145 --> 01:50:28.827
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

01:50:28.903 --> 01:50:31.551
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:34.939
It's going to be your idea to throw
the Horsemen out of the plane.

01:50:35.017 --> 01:50:37.494
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

01:50:37.574 --> 01:50:39.540
I can maybe catch you up on it later.

01:50:39.612 --> 01:50:42.056
Probably see you what, three to five?

01:50:43.209 --> 01:50:47.573
Come on, put it there.
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

01:50:48.124 --> 01:50:51.091
Basically, we showed them everything.

01:50:51.161 --> 01:50:56.446
How you kidnapped us to steal the very
thing that is in your pocket right now.

01:50:58.673 --> 01:51:00.037
Whoops!

01:51:03.668 --> 01:51:06.112
[Merritt]
You know, this thing here,

01:51:06.186 --> 01:51:09.664
which you said you could
use to adjust markets,

01:51:09.742 --> 01:51:13.424
manipulate governments,
and spy on whomever you choose.

01:51:13.498 --> 01:51:15.339
[Lula]
Also, you could, as you said,

01:51:15.416 --> 01:51:18.576
control the public
from outside the grid.

01:51:19.492 --> 01:51:24.778
These men destroy people's lives.

01:51:24.887 --> 01:51:28.933
Spying on the world, robbing you
of your right to privacy.

01:51:29.003 --> 01:51:32.243
And they do that
by hiding in the dark.

01:51:32.319 --> 01:51:36.877
So, in the Horsemen tradition,
we're here to expose them.

01:51:36.955 --> 01:51:41.990
Tonight, they, like all of us,

01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:45.230
are finally stepping into the light.

01:51:45.346 --> 01:51:47.074
[crowd cheering]

01:51:49.183 --> 01:51:50.387
[Atlas] Thank you, everybody!

01:51:50.461 --> 01:51:53.065
We are the Horsemen
and we will be back very soon!

01:51:55.376 --> 01:51:59.377
[crowd] Five, four, three, two, one!

01:51:59.452 --> 01:52:01.180
[fireworks bursting]

01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:03.134
[chiming]

01:52:06.845 --> 01:52:08.925
[sirens wailing]

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:18.799
- Hey, we're on the clock.
- Get a move on.

01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:22.995
There they are!

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:25.115
- There's more inside.
- Don't you bloody touch me!

01:52:25.187 --> 01:52:26.869
The Horsemen are over on the...

01:52:29.662 --> 01:52:31.106
Oh, shit!

01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:33.587
Stay with them!

01:52:33.658 --> 01:52:35.658
Everybody spread out!

01:52:35.736 --> 01:52:37.577
Nobody leaves this barge!

01:52:39.492 --> 01:52:42.572
[Austin] Rhodes, hold it right there!
Do not move!

01:52:48.243 --> 01:52:49.926
This contains everything.

01:52:50.002 --> 01:52:53.082
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

01:52:53.159 --> 01:52:56.160
All their contacts,
the entire network.

01:52:56.235 --> 01:52:58.440
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

01:52:58.553 --> 01:53:02.191
I told you.
I'm the same man I've always been.

01:53:02.269 --> 01:53:04.747
[Cowan] Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

01:53:04.827 --> 01:53:07.634
[Chase] I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

01:53:07.704 --> 01:53:10.910
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:13.707
Ten minutes.

01:53:15.496 --> 01:53:17.542
[Dylan] Now you're playing
the long game.

01:53:29.842 --> 01:53:31.330
[helicopter hovering]

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.639
Dad, I promise you I will fix this.

01:53:33.718 --> 01:53:36.083
You can't. Stop calling me dad.

01:53:36.156 --> 01:53:40.077
There were so many women,
I have no idea whose bastard you are.

01:53:40.152 --> 01:53:41.276
What?

01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:43.715
- What happened?
- Thin air, gone. Come with me.

01:53:43.788 --> 01:53:47.425
What're you talking about, gone?
People don't just disappear.

01:53:47.504 --> 01:53:50.232
You realize that he doesn't actually
have magical powers!

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:31.305
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:33.779
- Good to see you all.
- Good to see you, Li.

01:54:34.897 --> 01:54:36.022
Come on in.

01:54:39.292 --> 01:54:42.133
Good morning. Welcome.

01:54:44.567 --> 01:54:48.124
I'm proud of you.
All of you.

01:54:48.203 --> 01:54:51.727
I have a lot to show you. Come.

01:54:52.959 --> 01:54:54.197
Come.

01:55:05.546 --> 01:55:06.751
Dad.

01:55:24.167 --> 01:55:25.770
[Thaddeus] Yes.

01:55:25.886 --> 01:55:28.614
Your father and I were partners.

01:55:28.683 --> 01:55:31.843
Our act was that of rivals.

01:55:33.039 --> 01:55:38.676
I was the hard-eyed realist.
He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.

01:55:38.753 --> 01:55:41.481
We thought it was the perfect misdirect.

01:55:42.549 --> 01:55:46.186
Yes, in public, I did goad him.

01:55:46.265 --> 01:55:51.107
The only thing we didn't count on
was it going so wrong.

01:55:55.136 --> 01:55:56.944
Why?

01:55:57.054 --> 01:55:58.782
Why didn't you ever say anything to me?

01:55:58.853 --> 01:56:00.376
I don't know.

01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:02.815
Give it a name.

01:56:02.929 --> 01:56:06.327
Shame, guilt. Regret.

01:56:10.081 --> 01:56:13.048
[Atlas] Hey, guys, uh, you might
wanna come take a look at this.

01:56:14.717 --> 01:56:15.763
Hmm.

01:56:17.234 --> 01:56:18.439
Look.

01:56:18.553 --> 01:56:20.315
[Dylan]
<i>I put you in jail, man.</i>

01:56:20.391 --> 01:56:22.756
Why didn't you
say something then?

01:56:22.829 --> 01:56:25.830
Well, you know, I was going to.

01:56:25.906 --> 01:56:30.543
But then, you were so quick to show
your personal motivations that...

01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:35.218
Well, quite frankly
it spoiled the trick for me.

01:56:35.296 --> 01:56:36.581
I showed my weakness.

01:56:36.655 --> 01:56:39.462
Well, it showed you weren't ready.

01:56:39.532 --> 01:56:42.180
But when you came back to my cell,

01:56:42.249 --> 01:56:46.648
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me...

01:56:47.644 --> 01:56:49.132
...for your Horsemen.

01:56:50.721 --> 01:56:55.404
<i>And I said to myself,
"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:59.674
<i>And I knew it was my job to see to it</i>

01:56:59.752 --> 01:57:03.469
<i>that he became the magician
he was born to be.</i>

01:57:03.548 --> 01:57:05.867
All that was left then was...

01:57:07.624 --> 01:57:08.954
For me to hit bottom.

01:57:09.742 --> 01:57:14.584
So the safe, my father's wristwatch,
that was all you?

01:57:17.374 --> 01:57:20.693
<i>Walter and Tressler,
were they in on it too?</i>

01:57:20.771 --> 01:57:23.612
[Thaddeus] <i>Oh, we knew
Walter was in hiding.</i>

01:57:23.688 --> 01:57:27.405
<i>The Octa show was a setup
to expose him to the public.</i>

01:57:29.122 --> 01:57:32.566
<i>And you were right
about the Horsemen.</i>

01:57:32.679 --> 01:57:37.714
<i>They needed to learn to work together
like a single organism.</i>

01:57:45.386 --> 01:57:47.989
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

01:57:48.063 --> 01:57:49.666
You're the Horsemen, aren't you?

01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:52.626
[chuckles]

01:57:55.896 --> 01:57:57.305
[Lula chuckles]

01:57:57.374 --> 01:57:58.784
Okay.

01:57:58.853 --> 01:58:00.899
[Dylan] <i>But that can't be
what all this is about.</i>

01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:05.489
You know, the best tricks
work on many levels.

01:58:05.566 --> 01:58:09.533
And the deepest one,
for me, at least,

01:58:09.602 --> 01:58:12.409
is this moment right here.

01:58:16.035 --> 01:58:17.559
I'm sorry, Dylan.

01:58:18.193 --> 01:58:20.717
I miss your father.

01:58:20.791 --> 01:58:24.269
Thirty years is a long time to drag
something around, isn't it?

01:58:24.387 --> 01:58:26.035
Yes, it is.

01:58:35.975 --> 01:58:37.260
So, now what?

01:58:39.692 --> 01:58:42.579
- Now I'm about out of moves.
- Oh...

01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:44.012
And I'm tired.

01:58:44.087 --> 01:58:46.461
Come on, you're the one who said
that you believe that this road

01:58:46.485 --> 01:58:48.451
led to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

01:58:48.523 --> 01:58:49.569
I did.

01:58:49.642 --> 01:58:51.802
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

01:58:53.198 --> 01:58:54.880
I am.

01:58:58.553 --> 01:58:59.553
[chuckles]

01:59:00.671 --> 01:59:03.114
It's your game now.

01:59:03.188 --> 01:59:05.792
You play it however you see fit.

01:59:07.024 --> 01:59:12.866
My suggestion, however, is that
you find yourself a successor.

01:59:12.938 --> 01:59:14.826
Hi. Okay, so, um...

01:59:14.896 --> 01:59:18.215
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions. Right?

01:59:18.293 --> 01:59:20.771
Uh... By "a few,"
I think he means, like, five million.

01:59:20.850 --> 01:59:22.419
- Yeah.
- Well.

01:59:22.489 --> 01:59:24.330
Good luck to you all.

01:59:24.407 --> 01:59:26.055
- Okay. See, that's not fair.
- What!

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:27.260
- Come on.
- That's not right.

01:59:27.284 --> 01:59:28.619
That's gonna make me really angry!

01:59:28.643 --> 01:59:29.897
- [all chattering]
- Not right now.

01:59:29.921 --> 01:59:31.524
Oh, um, by the way...

01:59:33.758 --> 01:59:36.235
Pay no attention to the curtain.

01:59:39.152 --> 01:59:40.516
There is a curtain.

01:59:40.591 --> 01:59:41.920
Go, go, go!

01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:55.745
[Thaddeus] <i>Seeing is believing.
But is it truth?</i>

01:59:55.815 --> 01:59:58.464
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

01:59:58.533 --> 02:00:01.056
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

02:00:01.130 --> 02:00:05.450
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

02:00:05.526 --> 02:00:08.652
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

02:00:08.763 --> 02:00:14.321
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you</i>

02:00:14.397 --> 02:00:17.045
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

02:00:17.913 --> 02:00:20.596
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

02:00:20.671 --> 02:00:23.796
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

02:00:23.867 --> 02:00:27.755
<i>is an eye for an eye.</i>
