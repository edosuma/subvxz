WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:03.635
(distorted screaming)

00:07.806 --> 00:09.040
(door opens)

00:11.276 --> 00:13.710
(door creaks closed)

00:16.113 --> 00:18.181
LENA:
You light a candle
in a dark room.

00:19.383 --> 00:22.152
Then you say her name
three times.

00:22.185 --> 00:23.620
Bloody Mary.

00:23.653 --> 00:26.056
LENA:
When Bloody Mary appears,

00:26.089 --> 00:28.258
she can see into the depths
of your soul.

00:28.291 --> 00:30.293
Bloody Mary.

00:30.326 --> 00:32.795
LENA:
And if she doesn't like
what she sees...

00:32.828 --> 00:35.698
Bloody Mary.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.333
(gasps)

00:37.366 --> 00:38.600
(screams)

00:40.568 --> 00:43.171
Okay, but why anybody
calling on Bloody Mary

00:43.204 --> 00:44.372
if she's gonna
scratch your eyes out?

00:44.405 --> 00:45.673
Girl, she could see the future,

00:45.706 --> 00:47.408
and she could tell you
how to get what you want.

00:47.441 --> 00:48.742
If she don't kill you first?

00:48.775 --> 00:50.811
-Correct.
-(laughter)
-ELISE: No, thank you.

00:50.844 --> 00:53.380
So, can Bloody Mary help me
get back with River?

00:53.413 --> 00:55.682
I don't think he'll be into
a girl with scratched-out eyes.

00:55.715 --> 00:57.317
I'll wear sunglasses.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.151
But guys don't really
look at my face anyways.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.021
-(laughter)
-God, is there anything
you wouldn't do for a boy?

01:02.054 --> 01:03.422
Oh, don't be so judgy.

01:03.455 --> 01:06.025
River's been my best friend
since second grade.

01:06.058 --> 01:07.225
We belong together.

01:07.258 --> 01:08.727
Even if he doesn't see it yet.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.162
Ooh, you know who
I'd sell my soul for?

01:11.195 --> 01:13.265
That new guy from Columbus.
You know who I'm talking about?

01:13.298 --> 01:15.766
Uh-huh, his name is Joaquin,
and he is in my trig class.

01:15.799 --> 01:18.135
Oh, no, he's a ho.
Was caught finger banging

01:18.168 --> 01:20.070
Susie Jameson
in the janitor's closet.

01:20.103 --> 01:21.739
ELISE:
Ew, I don't care how hot he is,

01:21.772 --> 01:24.607
I am not getting it on
in the janitor's closet. Ugh.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.042
Germ central.

01:26.075 --> 01:27.610
-Might get rabies or something.
-(laughs)

01:27.643 --> 01:29.679
Rabies are not
sexually transmitted.

01:29.712 --> 01:31.347
How would you know?

01:31.380 --> 01:34.049
You know, maybe Bloody Mary
can help Bianca find

01:34.082 --> 01:36.485
-a boyfriend.
-MAGGIE and ELISE: Ooh!

01:36.518 --> 01:38.020
-(laughs)
-That is so dumb.

01:38.053 --> 01:40.222
-Can't y'all talk
about anything real?
-Whoa.

01:40.255 --> 01:42.090
Bloody Mary is real.

01:58.237 --> 01:59.739
Bloody Mary.

02:01.373 --> 02:04.176
OTHERS:
Bloody Mary.

02:05.177 --> 02:06.612
Bloody...

02:06.645 --> 02:08.581
-Aw, come on.
-Bianca.
-Really?

02:08.614 --> 02:10.148
Don't be such a baby.
It's just a game.

02:10.181 --> 02:11.749
It's not fucking funny.

02:13.284 --> 02:14.586
(door closes)

02:14.619 --> 02:16.754
-See, I told you
not to bring her.
-(sighs)

02:16.787 --> 02:19.189
I'm sorry, y'all. Hold on.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.624
(sighs)

02:29.331 --> 02:31.300
Why you always got to embarrass
me in front of my friends?

02:31.333 --> 02:34.136
I just didn't want to do it.
What's the big deal?

02:34.169 --> 02:35.404
You ain't got no friends,

02:35.437 --> 02:37.138
so you hang around
with me and mine,

02:37.171 --> 02:38.473
and now you're ruining
everybody's fun.

02:38.506 --> 02:39.741
I didn't ruin anything.

02:39.774 --> 02:42.043
Y'all can do whatever
you want in there.

02:42.076 --> 02:44.512
(scoffs) I am so sick
of carrying you around.

02:44.545 --> 02:47.314
You're a weight around my neck.
Always scared of something.

02:47.347 --> 02:49.350
Okay.

02:49.383 --> 02:50.751
Jesus.

02:50.784 --> 02:52.552
I'll do it.

02:54.587 --> 02:56.256
Take it down.

02:56.289 --> 02:58.491
All of it.

02:58.524 --> 03:00.260
You never know.

03:00.293 --> 03:01.761
If she turns out to be real,

03:01.794 --> 03:04.696
Bloody Mary might be some kind
of fairy godmother or something.

03:04.729 --> 03:06.598
(coughs) I don't remember nobody

03:06.631 --> 03:08.600
bibbidi bobbidi boo-ing
Cinderella's eyes

03:08.633 --> 03:10.201
out of her head.

03:13.103 --> 03:14.138
ELISE:
It's on.

03:14.171 --> 03:16.340
We're gonna do ours out here.

03:16.373 --> 03:18.476
(laughter)

03:18.509 --> 03:20.611
Wait, I want my own mirror, too.

03:20.644 --> 03:23.280
Ooh, stay here.
I'll be in the other room.

03:23.313 --> 03:26.015
Don't need y'all eavesdropping
on my amazing future.

03:30.786 --> 03:33.188
Okay, everyone
turn off the lights.

03:43.731 --> 03:45.266
(exhales)

03:47.134 --> 03:49.302
Bloody Mary.

03:50.270 --> 03:52.139
BOTH:
Bloody Mary.

03:52.172 --> 03:53.506
(shaky breathing)

03:57.476 --> 03:58.577
ALL:
Bloody Mary.

04:01.614 --> 04:04.217
(shaky breathing)

04:04.250 --> 04:06.217
(water dripping)

04:16.260 --> 04:18.162
I'm so sorry.

04:18.195 --> 04:21.131
BLOODY MARY:
To crave knowledge
is truly a noble thing.

04:21.164 --> 04:22.533
If you obey me,

04:22.566 --> 04:25.267
you shall have what you wish.

04:32.808 --> 04:34.209
(whispering indistinctly)

04:36.177 --> 04:37.479
(continues indistinctly)

04:37.512 --> 04:40.148
(panting)

04:40.181 --> 04:42.216
-(screaming)
-(gasps)

04:47.821 --> 04:49.156
(screams)

04:51.357 --> 04:53.326
(all screaming)

04:53.359 --> 04:55.362
What? What happened?

04:55.395 --> 04:57.597
-Holy shit!
-What the fuck?

04:59.532 --> 05:01.400
What?

05:01.433 --> 05:02.568
Guys.

05:02.601 --> 05:04.303
ELISE:
Bianca, wait.

05:04.336 --> 05:06.605
It's okay, it's okay.
We're all okay.

05:06.638 --> 05:09.140
The fuck we are. We just saw
Bloody Mary kill Maggie.

05:09.173 --> 05:10.775
No, I-I'm fine. I'm right here.

05:10.808 --> 05:13.211
No, no, no. We all saw it.
We heard you scream.

05:13.244 --> 05:16.114
-I did not scream.
-But-but you saw her?
In the mirror?

05:16.147 --> 05:18.682
Oh, you did.
You saw her, didn't you?

05:18.715 --> 05:21.618
Look, I thought I did,
but it's not real. It can't be.

05:21.651 --> 05:23.153
Bloody Mary spoke to me.

05:23.186 --> 05:25.422
-I didn't imagine that.
-She spoke?

05:25.455 --> 05:26.589
What did she say to you?

05:28.257 --> 05:30.125
Tell me.

05:31.327 --> 05:32.995
She knew about me
wanting to get into Yale.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.631
She said if I accuse

05:35.664 --> 05:38.733
my guidance counselor
of molesting and raping me,

05:38.766 --> 05:40.168
then he'll get fired.

05:40.201 --> 05:42.103
And I'll get
a full ride to Yale.

05:42.136 --> 05:45.339
She told me to drop Anna
from the top of the pyramid.

05:45.372 --> 05:47.107
She'll be paralyzed,

05:47.140 --> 05:48.542
but I'll be cheer captain.

05:48.575 --> 05:49.677
What did she promise you?

05:49.710 --> 05:51.245
If I want to be with River,

05:51.278 --> 05:52.379
I have to steal
his girlfriend's nudes

05:52.412 --> 05:54.180
and put them on the Internet.

05:54.213 --> 05:56.148
She'll be humiliated,
and he'll be mine forever.

06:01.254 --> 06:04.256
I told Bloody Mary
that I wanted to be rich.

06:04.289 --> 06:07.759
She told me that if I want
the money, that I have to...

06:07.792 --> 06:10.395
I have to hurt... You know what?

06:10.428 --> 06:12.363
It doesn't matter 'cause there's
no way in hell I'm doing it.

06:12.396 --> 06:14.699
Elise, what if she does to you
what she did to Maggie?

06:14.732 --> 06:15.733
But for real?

06:15.766 --> 06:18.369
Okay, maybe she's just,
like, trying to scare us.

06:18.402 --> 06:20.504
Well, it worked.
If that was a warning,

06:20.537 --> 06:22.305
I'm fucking warned.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.608
Look, maybe it's one of those
mirror hallucination things.

06:24.641 --> 06:26.109
They said if you look
at your face

06:26.142 --> 06:28.011
in the mirror long enough
with crappy lighting,

06:28.044 --> 06:30.312
you start to see
strange faces, apparitions.

06:30.345 --> 06:32.281
But the same one,
all of us, really?

06:32.314 --> 06:35.251
No. We saw what we saw.

06:35.284 --> 06:37.720
Bloody Mary is coming for us.

06:37.753 --> 06:39.587
ELISE:
Whatever it is we saw,

06:39.620 --> 06:41.489
or thought we saw...

06:42.657 --> 06:44.358
...it's over now.

06:45.593 --> 06:47.328
Let's go home.

06:58.504 --> 07:00.506
-(siren blaring in distance)
-(dog barking)

07:04.710 --> 07:06.545
You know that was real, right?

07:06.578 --> 07:09.314
Ain't nothing real but the rent.

07:09.347 --> 07:11.316
(Robin moaning)

07:11.349 --> 07:13.385
MAN: Aw, shit. I thought
you said we had the place

07:13.418 --> 07:15.419
-to ourselves tonight.
-We do.

07:15.452 --> 07:16.754
-What y'all doing here?
-Mama, something happened.

07:16.787 --> 07:19.056
ROBIN:
Your friend house burn down?

07:19.089 --> 07:20.991
'Cause that's the only reason
you ought to be at my door.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.594
-We'll be in our room.
-ROBIN: The fuck you will.

07:23.627 --> 07:25.995
I deserve a night to myself.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.697
-Y'all almost grown.
-(zipper closes)

07:27.730 --> 07:29.732
Get out of my house right now.

07:45.746 --> 07:47.948
You know what
the hardest part is?

07:49.183 --> 07:51.417
I really want to go to Yale.

07:54.153 --> 07:56.256
-I want to get out of here.
-You don't need Bloody Mary

07:56.289 --> 07:59.159
to get into Yale.
You're smart enough on your own.

07:59.192 --> 08:02.995
Do you know how many smart
people don't get in every year?

08:03.028 --> 08:04.597
Thousands.

08:04.630 --> 08:07.566
Thousands of people who want
to learn and make a difference,

08:07.599 --> 08:09.767
but they never get the chance.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.703
They just disappear
into the masses

08:11.736 --> 08:15.340
and struggle like
everybody else in life.

08:15.373 --> 08:18.141
I don't want to disappear.

08:20.644 --> 08:22.512
That's not gonna happen, B.

08:23.513 --> 08:25.281
Not to you.

08:27.283 --> 08:29.017
Now get some sleep.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.165
♪ ♪

09:11.256 --> 09:14.191
♪ ♪

09:31.632 --> 09:33.435
-Get any sleep?
-Not a wink.

09:33.468 --> 09:35.003
Me neither.

09:35.036 --> 09:36.538
Lena Lawrence.

09:36.571 --> 09:39.240
Why aren't you dressed up
for spirit week? Unacceptable.

09:39.273 --> 09:41.875
Oh, damn. That was today. Sorry.

09:41.908 --> 09:44.178
(sighs) Get your shit
together, Lawrence.

09:44.211 --> 09:45.412
(scoffs)

09:47.214 --> 09:49.415
Might not be a bad idea
to drop that one on her head.

09:49.448 --> 09:51.150
-(chuckles)
-(school bell rings)

09:54.153 --> 09:55.555
Good morning.

09:55.588 --> 09:58.023
Many of you will be glad
to hear that our segment

09:58.056 --> 10:00.926
on black hole math is over.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.561
Hopefully bringing the class
back down to Earth

10:02.594 --> 10:04.496
will allow some of you
to resurrect your averages.

10:04.529 --> 10:05.997
You know who you are.

10:06.030 --> 10:08.199
We're gonna spend
the rest of the quarter

10:08.232 --> 10:12.103
talking about the laws
of reflection and refraction.

10:12.136 --> 10:14.205
-(students murmuring)
-MS. BROOKS: Reflection

10:14.238 --> 10:17.307
is all about how light
hits an object.

10:17.340 --> 10:18.508
In a way, you could say

10:18.541 --> 10:20.243
everything we see
is a reflection

10:20.276 --> 10:22.479
because the reflection of light

10:22.512 --> 10:25.547
is what enables us to see
everything around us.

10:25.580 --> 10:27.349
But reflections
aren't real though.

10:27.382 --> 10:30.552
Oh, they're as real as
you and me. Maybe more so.

10:30.585 --> 10:32.388
The ancient Mayans

10:32.421 --> 10:34.889
and other Indigenous
cultures believed

10:34.922 --> 10:37.058
that reflections on water
and in mirrors

10:37.091 --> 10:38.559
were portals to other worlds.

10:38.592 --> 10:41.896
Essential gateways
between humans and gods.

10:41.929 --> 10:44.264
Wait, so mirrors can be doors
to other worlds?

10:44.297 --> 10:46.533
MS. BROOKS:
Well, the Mayans
didn't have many mirrors.

10:46.566 --> 10:48.168
They did mine silver,

10:48.201 --> 10:50.537
which is the most
reflective metal,

10:50.570 --> 10:55.074
but, with all due respect
to the Mayans,

10:55.107 --> 10:57.843
reflection is just the change

10:57.876 --> 10:59.578
in direction of light waves
when they

10:59.611 --> 11:02.180
bounce off of a barrier,
and they obey

11:02.213 --> 11:04.149
-physical laws.
-(mirror cracking)

11:04.182 --> 11:05.950
Three laws.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.520
(gasps)

11:09.553 --> 11:11.788
You all made pacts with me.

11:12.622 --> 11:13.590
Fulfill them!

11:13.623 --> 11:15.492
(screaming)

11:21.464 --> 11:24.400
Oh, God, she's real.
She's really real.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.135
She's not going away.
Ghost, demon,

11:26.168 --> 11:28.403
-Babadook, or whatever she is.
-What are y'all doing here?

11:28.436 --> 11:29.404
You're supposed to be in class.

11:29.437 --> 11:32.174
No, no, I texted her.
She's a part of this.

11:32.207 --> 11:33.542
Look, Bloody Mary can get to us

11:33.575 --> 11:36.143
from anywhere. We just
got to do what she says.

11:36.176 --> 11:37.878
Are you seriously talking about
putting a girl in a wheelchair

11:37.911 --> 11:39.046
just so you can be
cheer captain?

11:39.079 --> 11:40.214
Anna being in a wheelchair

11:40.247 --> 11:41.916
is better than me being dead.

11:41.949 --> 11:43.551
Wait,

11:43.584 --> 11:45.251
who said anything about dying?

We can only surmise

24:35.803 --> 24:37.505
that, at some point,

24:37.538 --> 24:40.140
Margaret Worth
captured the wrong one.

24:41.908 --> 24:44.345
Her body was found
in that cabin,

24:44.378 --> 24:47.080
violently stabbed.

24:47.113 --> 24:48.847
The killer was never found.

24:53.052 --> 24:55.821
We believe this is the knife
that killed her.

24:55.854 --> 24:57.422
This type of dagger

24:57.455 --> 25:00.325
is extremely out of place
in 19th century Missouri.

25:00.358 --> 25:02.928
It seems perhaps more African,
Caribbean in origin.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.195
And older, much older.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.937

I don't want you!
I want my mama.

I hadn't seen
my own face in years.

40:32.689 --> 40:34.324
When I looked into that mirror,

40:34.357 --> 40:36.159
I remembered who I was,

40:36.192 --> 40:39.062
a servant of the most high
Mami Wata.

40:39.095 --> 40:42.798
In that moment, I called on

40:42.831 --> 40:45.901
the goddess to give me justice.

take justice.
I also took vengeance.

Stop!

BLOODY MARY:
That child was living
in deception and lies.

41:20.231 --> 41:23.802
I should have given her
truth and empathy.

41:23.835 --> 41:25.202
Instead, I killed her

41:25.235 --> 41:27.972
in passion and vengeance.

41:28.005 --> 41:31.809
I sullied my soul
before the goddess.

41:31.842 --> 41:33.910
I could not bring
that poison with me

41:33.943 --> 41:35.778
to meet the ancestors.

41:35.811 --> 41:39.015
