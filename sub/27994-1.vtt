08:27.339 --> 08:28.338
Hey, Buzi.

08:29.206 --> 08:30.369
Yeah, babe?

08:30.371 --> 08:32.703
Come here, check this out.

08:38.804 --> 08:39.803
What's up?

08:39.804 --> 08:41.970
Check these pictures out.

08:41.972 --> 08:42.804
Aren't they wild?

08:43.705 --> 08:44.538
Oh my god.

08:46.703 --> 08:48.470
Oh my god, what's this?

08:48.472 --> 08:49.571
They're orbs.

08:50.838 --> 08:52.601
Wow,

08:52.603 --> 08:55.304
yeah, it's spooky.

08:55.306 --> 08:57.603
Look at these little
things over here,

08:57.605 --> 09:01.068
it looks like medallions
with spooky faces on it.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.302
They do.

09:02.304 --> 09:03.636
They look like
a ghost, you know?

09:03.638 --> 09:05.236
They look like spooky
faces, don't they?

09:05.238 --> 09:06.702
Yeah.

09:06.704 --> 09:07.902
Look at this, look like
an ugly little person

09:07.904 --> 09:09.602
inside that little circle.

09:09.604 --> 09:11.236
They're orbs.

09:11.238 --> 09:12.671
They're floating orbs.

09:14.671 --> 09:16.403
They actually look like ghosts.

09:16.405 --> 09:17.768
- They look like...
- God, look at that one.

09:17.770 --> 09:19.469
- Look at that one.
- That's freaky, man.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.936
They really look like ghosts.

09:20.938 --> 09:25.702
Oh, there's so many of 'em,
there's thousands of 'em.

09:25.704 --> 09:27.369
- Yeah.
- Look at that one, wow.

09:27.371 --> 09:29.437
Where did you get them from?

09:29.439 --> 09:31.003
Joey from Long Island
sent me these pictures,

09:31.005 --> 09:32.406
I just got the letter today.

09:33.937 --> 09:35.504
Yeah.

09:35.506 --> 09:36.572
That's pretty scary.

09:38.205 --> 09:40.203
I can't believe we are
going tomorrow, babe.

09:41.438 --> 09:42.903
We're gonna be walking
around in these woods.

09:42.905 --> 09:46.136
Oh my god, I don't
know, I don't know.

09:46.138 --> 09:49.202
Hopefully we'll be able to
get some of these pictures.

09:49.204 --> 09:50.969
Yeah.

09:50.971 --> 09:52.602
I'm excited, I can't wait.

09:52.604 --> 09:54.336
I can't wait either.

09:56.239 --> 09:57.138
Hold on, babe.

10:02.771 --> 10:03.572
Hello?

10:05.571 --> 10:06.373
Hey, Mike.

10:07.838 --> 10:08.771
How's it going?

10:11.339 --> 10:13.906
I'm doing fine, I'm doing
fine, thanks for asking.

10:15.904 --> 10:17.906
Yes, we're looking
forward to seeing you.

10:20.138 --> 10:21.605
We're gonna be up on the 15th.

10:24.572 --> 10:25.870
12 o'clock's a good time, Mike,

10:25.872 --> 10:27.439
that's a perfect time for us.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.337
I'm coming with my
girlfriend, Buzi.

10:34.304 --> 10:35.838
Yes, Buzi's her name.

10:37.138 --> 10:41.136
Buzi.

10:41.138 --> 10:43.171
Yeah, she's looking
forward to meeting you.

10:45.771 --> 10:46.769
The weather's
beautiful here today,

10:46.771 --> 10:48.438
it's so sunny and awesome.

10:51.339 --> 10:52.705
The Huntington Diner?

10:55.004 --> 10:57.037
I'm sure we'll find it, Mike.

10:57.039 --> 10:58.672
We have GPS, yes.

11:01.071 --> 11:02.504
Perfect, perfect.

11:03.638 --> 11:05.704
Yes, we look forward
to meeting you as well.

11:08.272 --> 11:10.735
And I'll call you
when we get in.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.538
Thanks, Mike,
thanks for calling.

11:13.671 --> 11:15.139
Okay, okay.

11:16.837 --> 11:18.069
Bye, bye for now, okay.

11:18.071 --> 11:19.373
Thank you, Mike, bye bye.

11:20.438 --> 11:21.735
Who was that, Babe?

11:21.737 --> 11:23.769
That's that guy,
Mike Gallagher.

11:23.771 --> 11:27.768
Oh, I remember, that's the
historian you told me about.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.270
That's the dude that knows
all about Mount Misery Road.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.536
Yeah, yeah, oh my
god, that's cool.

11:31.538 --> 11:33.569
I know, it's
very exciting, I can't wait.

11:33.571 --> 11:35.536
So you set an appointment
for tomorrow, yeah?

11:35.538 --> 11:36.869
Yeah, we're gonna
have some lunch with him.

11:36.871 --> 11:39.202
Yeah, that's
really cool, babe.

11:39.204 --> 11:40.402
But why don't you
come over here?

11:40.404 --> 11:43.337
I have so many articles
online that I found

11:43.339 --> 11:46.502
and maybe you can
take a look at that?

11:46.504 --> 11:49.702
It just looks like
it's one after another,

11:49.704 --> 11:52.303
everything is
about Mount Misery.

11:52.305 --> 11:54.505
- Look at that.
- Look at that.

11:55.372 --> 11:57.002
Haunted road trip?

11:57.004 --> 12:00.037
One of Long Island
creepiest places?

12:01.705 --> 12:03.303
Oh my god.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.536
And here?

12:04.538 --> 12:06.836
Ghost, Crazy Mary?

12:06.838 --> 12:08.635
Who is that, the woman in white?

12:08.637 --> 12:10.502
- Look at this.
- Check this one out.

12:10.504 --> 12:13.303
New York's dangerous
dead end road.

12:13.305 --> 12:16.203
Oh shit, this is scary.

12:16.205 --> 12:18.035
- Oh my god.
- What's this one?

12:18.037 --> 12:21.970
Folklore, tales, legends,

12:21.972 --> 12:23.436
myths.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.635
Huntington's own spirits
that still roam the old hill.

12:26.637 --> 12:31.069
Oh my god, that is a
lot of things over here.

12:31.071 --> 12:34.237
Check that out, oh my
god, check these pictures.

12:38.404 --> 12:39.739
Ugh.

12:40.772 --> 12:43.104
Oh my god, that's spooky.

12:43.106 --> 12:44.302
That's scary, babe.

12:44.304 --> 12:46.471
That creature's what
was scary, though.

12:50.338 --> 12:51.605
Look at that.

12:54.437 --> 12:56.669
Look at this one.

12:56.671 --> 12:58.938
Oh my god, that's creepy.

13:01.039 --> 13:04.770
It looks like a beast,
like a black creature

13:04.772 --> 13:06.601
with the red eyes
glowing, look at that.

13:06.603 --> 13:08.136
That's the Mothman beast

13:08.138 --> 13:10.402
that supposedly
lives in the woods.

13:10.404 --> 13:12.206
Oh my god, it's ugly.

13:13.672 --> 13:16.869
Ugly motherfucker, oh my
god, it's creepy looking.

13:16.871 --> 13:18.803
Ugh.

13:18.805 --> 13:20.336
Oh my god, I'm so excited!

13:20.338 --> 13:23.270
Look at those pictures
of this guy's eyes, man.

13:23.272 --> 13:24.336
Yeah.

13:31.871 --> 13:32.938
Look at this.

13:47.403 --> 13:50.738
Look at
those ugly red eyes.

14:11.904 --> 14:14.768
Wow, it looks like, it
looks like it's gonna be

14:14.770 --> 14:16.739
a lot of ghosts on
Mount Misery Road.

14:17.905 --> 14:20.136
I don't want to run
into any of them.

14:20.138 --> 14:21.769
Babe, you know
I'm gonna be filming

14:21.771 --> 14:23.235
you in the woods
and me in the woods,

14:23.237 --> 14:25.070
we're gonna be looking
at orbs and ghosts

14:25.072 --> 14:26.836
and I'm gonna try to
document everything.

14:26.838 --> 14:30.269
Yeah I know, I know, I know.

14:30.271 --> 14:31.935
Are you up for that, or what?

14:31.937 --> 14:34.902
Well, I let you do whatever
you want with your camera,

14:34.904 --> 14:37.903
I know, it's okay.

14:39.303 --> 14:41.171
You're gonna be my
little ghost hunter.

14:43.038 --> 14:44.669
Are you ready for that, or what?

14:44.671 --> 14:46.303
- I guess.
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.

14:46.305 --> 14:47.669
I guess.

14:47.671 --> 14:49.969
Hey, but you wanna
celebrate now?

14:49.971 --> 14:53.503
You wanna go with me and
check out some lunch places

14:53.505 --> 14:55.002
in town?

14:55.004 --> 14:56.269
Yeah, why don't we go
have a drink somewhere?

14:56.271 --> 14:57.469
Yeah, yeah, okay.

14:57.471 --> 14:58.735
- Is that all right?
- Yes.

14:58.737 --> 15:00.171
Give me a kiss.

16:52.871 --> 16:54.003
Babe,
you're so sexy.

16:54.005 --> 16:55.836
I love dancing for you, babe.

16:55.838 --> 16:57.134
I love when you
dance for me, it's awesome.

16:57.136 --> 16:58.469
I know.

16:58.471 --> 16:59.401
Are you
excited that we're going

16:59.403 --> 17:00.636
to Mount Misery Road tomorrow?

17:00.638 --> 17:02.369
So excited.

17:02.371 --> 17:04.202
I'm so excited.

17:04.204 --> 17:05.903
I can't wait for that.

17:05.905 --> 17:07.002
We're gonna
have a great time.

17:07.003 --> 17:07.871
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.569
You wanna sit down
and get some food?

17:10.570 --> 17:13.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's
have something, I'm hungry.

17:13.169 --> 17:15.271
- I'm starving.
- All right.

17:24.471 --> 17:27.268
So yeah, they have great
specials here, babe.

17:27.270 --> 17:28.969
I come here many years ago,

17:28.971 --> 17:31.101
it's the first time I've
been back here in a while.

17:31.103 --> 17:32.602
They've got the shrimp
on Tuesday nights,

17:32.604 --> 17:34.569
- they've got Monday night...
- Excuse me.

17:34.571 --> 17:37.134
I didn't wanna be rude but
I thought I overheard you

17:37.136 --> 17:38.939
talking about Mount Misery Road.

17:40.037 --> 17:41.269
Yeah.

17:41.271 --> 17:43.235
That's on Long Island,
that's where I'm from.

17:43.237 --> 17:44.801
- Huntington.
- Really?

17:44.803 --> 17:45.970
Really.

17:45.972 --> 17:47.702
Interesting,
what a coincidence.

17:47.704 --> 17:49.602
We're actually going
up there tomorrow.

17:49.604 --> 17:52.569
We've been planning
our trip for months now

17:52.571 --> 17:54.836
and we have this thing
about ghosts and orbs.

17:54.838 --> 17:56.067
Really?

17:56.069 --> 17:57.302
We're looking to see
if we can find some

17:57.304 --> 17:59.170
in the woods over there
on Mount Misery Road.

18:01.005 --> 18:02.772
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sure.

18:06.270 --> 18:08.034
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm Curt.

18:08.036 --> 18:08.969
This is Buzi.

18:08.971 --> 18:09.871
- Hi Buzi.
- Hi, hi Curt.

18:11.204 --> 18:14.835
So, I'm interested,

18:14.837 --> 18:17.203
what can you tell me
about Mount Misery Road?

18:17.205 --> 18:20.435
Well, Mount Misery
Road got its name

18:20.437 --> 18:23.070
from the settlers
that were trying to,

18:24.270 --> 18:26.402
you know, take their
wagons up the slopes

18:26.404 --> 18:27.669
and on the rocky road.

18:27.671 --> 18:30.135
That's why they named
it Mount Misery Road.

18:30.137 --> 18:31.770
Interesting.

18:31.772 --> 18:32.605
Tell me more.

18:35.904 --> 18:38.936
There were rumors of
strange lights in the sky

18:38.938 --> 18:41.238
and sightings in the sky also.

18:42.405 --> 18:45.401
There's a sighting
of a hell hound

18:45.403 --> 18:49.034
or a man beast creature
that roams those hills

18:49.036 --> 18:51.502
with red, glowing eyes.

18:51.504 --> 18:52.568
- You believe this, Buzi?
- Really.

18:52.570 --> 18:54.268
Yeah, that's creepy.

18:54.270 --> 18:56.034
It's
definitely creepy.

18:56.036 --> 18:57.104
Yeah, it is.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.070
What else, Curt?

19:01.370 --> 19:04.068
Then, in the 1840s,

19:04.070 --> 19:06.504
there was an asylum built
on the top of the hill

19:07.970 --> 19:11.068
for the insane, they kept
the insane in the asylum

19:11.070 --> 19:12.969
because that was the
only way they could

19:12.971 --> 19:14.870
treat them back then.

19:14.872 --> 19:17.336
There was a patient named Mary.

19:17.338 --> 19:20.402
Somehow she started
a fire in her room

19:20.404 --> 19:23.835
and the fire burned
down the asylum,

19:23.837 --> 19:25.835
killing all the workers

19:25.837 --> 19:27.168
and all the patients.

19:27.170 --> 19:28.402
- No way!
- Yes.

19:28.404 --> 19:30.602
That
crazy bitch, my god.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.902
And then 10 years later,

19:32.904 --> 19:36.101
they built another
asylum on the same spot.

19:36.103 --> 19:39.702
But three months later after
that asylum was finished,

19:39.704 --> 19:41.502
it burned to the ground also.

19:41.504 --> 19:43.236
- You kidding me?
- No.

19:43.238 --> 19:44.468
Not kidding.

19:44.470 --> 19:45.269
That's the
legend of that area?

19:45.271 --> 19:46.503
That's the legend.

19:46.505 --> 19:47.569
That's
a coincidence, wow,

19:47.571 --> 19:49.402
that's very fascinating.

19:49.404 --> 19:51.436
And it's been said
that they can still

19:51.438 --> 19:53.005
smell the burning building,

19:54.904 --> 19:59.568
hear the screams of the
victims in the woods.

19:59.570 --> 20:01.068
You
believe that, Buzi?

20:01.070 --> 20:01.901
That's scary.

20:01.903 --> 20:02.838
It is creepy.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.869
Go on, tell us more.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.735
There has been many
instances of mutilated bodies

20:08.737 --> 20:12.035
and slaughtered animals
found in those woods.

20:12.037 --> 20:14.269
The local residents
think that it's the work

20:14.271 --> 20:16.069
of the man beast,

20:16.071 --> 20:20.135
the hell hound that roams
those woods to this day.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.035
That beast with
those red, glowing eyes?

20:22.037 --> 20:23.235
Red, glowing eyes.

20:23.237 --> 20:24.703
Hmm,
babe, that's the beast

20:24.705 --> 20:26.636
- that we saw on that computer.
- Ew.

20:26.638 --> 20:28.303
My god,
that thing's ugly.

20:28.305 --> 20:30.235
So that thing's still in
the woods, you think, today?

20:30.237 --> 20:31.835
That's what they say.

20:31.837 --> 20:33.835
Really,
how do you know this?

20:33.837 --> 20:36.337
Well, I read the
reports about this

20:37.904 --> 20:40.035
when I researched
Mount Misery Road.

20:40.037 --> 20:43.436
And that was mentioned about
the man beast creature,

20:43.438 --> 20:44.304
the hell hound.

20:45.838 --> 20:47.538
Well, from all
that I've told you,

20:48.971 --> 20:52.669
my suggestion would be to stay
away from Mount Misery Road.

20:52.671 --> 20:56.104
It's considered one of the
most haunted places in America.

20:57.305 --> 21:00.102
There's been people that
have gone into the woods

21:00.104 --> 21:02.302
and that they never
saw them again.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.736
My god.

21:04.738 --> 21:06.969
You know, we're
going up there tomorrow

21:06.971 --> 21:09.736
and we're really, really
excited about this trip.

21:09.738 --> 21:11.901
With all the shit
that's been going on there

21:11.903 --> 21:13.104
that I've told you about,

21:14.804 --> 21:16.603
the white lady with the robe

21:16.605 --> 21:18.635
and the mutilated bodies

21:18.637 --> 21:20.935
and the slaughtered animals,

21:20.937 --> 21:23.102
it's not a safe place.

21:23.104 --> 21:25.001
You have no business
going there.

21:25.003 --> 21:26.405
What are you going there for?

21:28.336 --> 21:29.602
The reason why
we're going up there

21:29.604 --> 21:32.368
is that we are
ghost enthusiasts.

21:32.370 --> 21:33.736
We like going to haunted places

21:33.738 --> 21:35.904
to see if we can
find orbs and ghosts.

21:36.836 --> 21:38.468
We like ghosts.

21:38.470 --> 21:39.834
Right?

21:44.571 --> 21:48.570
Well, I'm warning you, stay
away from Mount Misery Road.

21:48.572 --> 21:50.669
That land is cursed.

21:50.671 --> 21:53.934
You and your girlfriend
can go into those woods

21:53.936 --> 21:56.269
and never be seen again.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.105
It's haunted.

21:58.270 --> 21:59.738
Why would you and
your girlfriend

22:01.071 --> 22:02.105
wanna be in there?

22:03.605 --> 22:06.005
Okay, Curt, I really appreciate
what you're telling us.

22:07.304 --> 22:08.834
You know, we've been
planning this trip for months

22:08.836 --> 22:11.402
and it's taken us a
while to get this trip

22:11.404 --> 22:13.005
and the money together to do it.

22:14.370 --> 22:17.504
So, you know, we're even
meeting with a local historian

22:18.535 --> 22:20.336
named Mike Gallagher, the
guy's well known in that area.

22:20.338 --> 22:23.536
We've already confirmed the
appointment, he called us today.

22:23.538 --> 22:24.835
So we can't back out now.

22:24.837 --> 22:26.868
There's just too much
time invested in this,

22:26.870 --> 22:28.569
too much money invested in this.

22:28.571 --> 22:29.868
We're gonna go.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.336
We're looking forward
to seeing if we can find

22:31.338 --> 22:34.702
some orbs and, you know,
ghosts in the woods.

22:34.704 --> 22:35.869
I can't wait either.

22:35.871 --> 22:37.736
She's excited, I'm excited.

22:37.738 --> 22:39.835
So we're really
not gonna back out.

22:39.837 --> 22:42.770
We're not gonna cancel our trip.

22:44.804 --> 22:47.201
You should listen
to what I'm saying,

22:47.203 --> 22:48.468
to stay away from there.

22:48.470 --> 22:49.734
You don't need to go there

22:49.736 --> 22:52.635
because it's a
very haunted place.

22:55.270 --> 22:59.735
I'm warning you, stay away
from Mount Misery Road.

22:59.737 --> 23:01.501
That's cursed land.

23:01.503 --> 23:05.702
You and your girlfriend could
go up there to those woods

23:05.704 --> 23:09.068
and go in and never
be seen again.

23:09.070 --> 23:11.636
So I would say stay away.

23:11.638 --> 23:14.268
Stay away from
Mount Misery Road.

23:14.270 --> 23:17.403
You have no business
being there.

23:17.405 --> 23:18.505
It's cursed land.

23:51.936 --> 23:52.937
Hey, babe.

23:54.238 --> 23:55.338
Hey, babe.

24:14.337 --> 24:15.269
Hey, babe, what
do you think about

24:15.271 --> 24:16.639
that guy in the bar tonight?

24:19.204 --> 24:20.171
Was he for real?

24:21.538 --> 24:22.372
Weirdo.

24:25.037 --> 24:27.304
Trying to scare
us and spook us.

24:29.703 --> 24:31.604
Before we even went
into those woods.

24:35.803 --> 24:37.170
He actually pissed me off.

24:38.904 --> 24:40.671
Telling us that land is cursed.

24:43.470 --> 24:45.136
He's full of shit!

24:46.504 --> 24:49.701
Yeah, that fool was drunk.

24:49.703 --> 24:51.271
I think he was out of his mind.

24:52.704 --> 24:55.301
And I think he wanted
to scare us on purpose

24:55.303 --> 24:58.703
and make us paranoid
so we cancel our trip.

25:01.305 --> 25:02.938
Why, are you scared, baby?

25:04.004 --> 25:05.867
- Are you scared?
- No.

25:05.869 --> 25:07.102
No.

25:07.104 --> 25:09.334
Are you sure?

25:09.336 --> 25:10.701
Scared?

25:10.703 --> 25:12.269
I'm not scared.

25:12.271 --> 25:14.600
Actually, I can't wait to
go in those woods tomorrow,

25:14.602 --> 25:16.770
babe, and see some ghosts.

25:17.904 --> 25:20.002
Me too, we're gonna
have a great time.

25:20.004 --> 25:20.804
Yeah.

25:25.636 --> 25:27.402
Babe, let's go to bed now.

25:27.404 --> 25:28.305
It's getting late.

25:29.470 --> 25:31.069
All right.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.969
We have a busy day tomorrow.

25:32.971 --> 25:35.035
We gotta get up early.

25:35.037 --> 25:35.871
I know.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.204
Sounds good.

29:32.137 --> 29:33.469
Morning, babe.

29:33.471 --> 29:34.537
Hey.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.105
Buzi?

32:21.470 --> 32:23.069
- Buzi?
- What?

32:23.071 --> 32:26.404
Oh my god, what a
night on the planes.

32:28.869 --> 32:32.334
All those delayed flights to
get to to here, to New York.

32:32.336 --> 32:33.270
Oh my god.

32:36.104 --> 32:37.204
Hey.

32:40.371 --> 32:42.502
- Hey.
- Good morning.

32:42.504 --> 32:43.668
Good morning.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.135
Good morning, Buzi.

32:45.137 --> 32:47.304
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32:48.537 --> 32:49.604
Are you filming me?

32:51.901 --> 32:52.235
No.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.737
We have a beautiful day today.

32:57.869 --> 32:59.401
Mount Misery Road, here we come.

32:59.403 --> 33:01.670
Oh, yeah, today, oh my god.

33:03.036 --> 33:05.234
- Are you excited?
- I'm so excited!

33:05.236 --> 33:09.002
I can't wait.

33:09.004 --> 33:10.105
I can't wait.

33:13.104 --> 33:14.635
So why don't
you get up and take a shower

33:14.637 --> 33:15.635
so we can get ready?

33:15.637 --> 33:18.136
Yeah, yeah, I better get up.

33:23.838 --> 33:25.237
Buzi, you ready?

33:26.436 --> 33:28.070
In a minute, babe.

33:32.005 --> 33:36.233
Babe, you know, I was thinking
what you told me yesterday,

33:36.235 --> 33:38.302
that you're gonna film me?

33:38.304 --> 33:39.437
And the whole trip.

33:41.037 --> 33:44.468
And I think I decided that
I'm gonna assist in that.

33:44.470 --> 33:47.635
And I'm gonna be our
new ghost hunter.

33:47.637 --> 33:48.468
Really?

33:48.470 --> 33:49.401
That's awesome, babe.

33:49.403 --> 33:52.367
It's gonna be so exciting.

33:52.369 --> 33:53.501
Let's go.

34:29.469 --> 34:30.868
Great weather, right?

34:30.870 --> 34:32.971
It's amazing.

34:35.870 --> 34:37.567
Hey, babe?

34:37.569 --> 34:39.034
Yeah, Buzi?

34:39.036 --> 34:41.168
I'm so excited, I can't wait
to meet that historian guy

34:41.170 --> 34:42.935
that you told me about.

34:42.937 --> 34:44.868
Like, it's gonna
be great meeting.

34:44.870 --> 34:46.335
Yeah,
Mike is a great guy,

34:46.337 --> 34:48.402
very knowledgeable about
the Mount Misery Road area.

34:48.404 --> 34:50.134
- Yeah.
- He's a great historian

34:50.136 --> 34:53.001
and he's gonna probably
educate us a lot today.

34:53.003 --> 34:54.568
We're gonna have so
much fun, oh my god.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.367
I know, it's gonna
be awesome, I can't wait.

34:56.369 --> 34:57.270
Let's go.

35:19.436 --> 35:21.235
Hey,
Mike, I'm Charlie.

35:21.237 --> 35:22.669
Hey, how you doing?

35:22.671 --> 35:24.069
This is my girlfriend, Buzi.

35:24.971 --> 35:26.567
Hey.

35:26.569 --> 35:28.000
And I just want you to know,

35:28.002 --> 35:29.868
it's freezing outside,
very cold up here.

35:29.870 --> 35:32.367
We just came in from
Florida, as you know,

35:32.369 --> 35:35.034
and I just want to thank
you for meeting us.

35:35.036 --> 35:36.967
And I came up to see if
I could pick your brain

35:36.969 --> 35:38.602
apart a little bit about
a book that you did

35:38.604 --> 35:41.503
back in the 80s about
Mount Misery Road.

35:43.836 --> 35:45.300
You can ask me a few questions

35:45.302 --> 35:47.801
but I'm gonna tell
you right off the bat

35:47.803 --> 35:49.838
that I don't do these
interviews anymore.

35:51.002 --> 35:53.268
The only reason I
came here today,

35:53.270 --> 35:54.938
I just felt responsible

35:56.104 --> 35:58.471
to tell you that you
need to stay away.

35:59.570 --> 36:02.401
This is an incredibly
dangerous place.

36:02.403 --> 36:04.400
There have been people
who've disappeared,

36:04.402 --> 36:06.770
probably died in those
woods over the last,

36:07.870 --> 36:08.703
decades.

36:09.936 --> 36:10.771
And I,

36:11.936 --> 36:14.300
I just feel you should
just find another place

36:14.302 --> 36:16.600
to take your vacation.

36:16.602 --> 36:18.535
We were going to go
there during the day

36:18.537 --> 36:21.300
and basically see if we
could find some orbs.

36:21.302 --> 36:23.568
Some pictures of
maybe some ghosts.

36:23.570 --> 36:27.102
I heard that the Mothman's
in there, jumping from trees.

36:27.104 --> 36:29.136
There's been sightings
of this Mothman.

36:30.704 --> 36:33.034
In your book you've
written about the asylum

36:33.036 --> 36:35.268
and we're trying to see if we
can find the foundation there

36:35.270 --> 36:36.571
of the old asylum.

36:37.970 --> 36:40.268
Maybe we can see Mary
floating through the woods

36:40.270 --> 36:41.702
during the day.

36:41.704 --> 36:42.934
Do you know how many
times I've talked to people

36:42.936 --> 36:44.534
about these things
over the years?

36:44.536 --> 36:47.234
Seriously, you are
wasting my time

36:47.236 --> 36:50.703
getting me up here on a
freezing Saturday morning.

36:52.969 --> 36:53.936
These things,

36:54.902 --> 36:56.769
whether they exist or not,

36:56.771 --> 36:58.267
I don't know.

36:58.269 --> 37:00.435
I've spent decades of my
life chasing these things,

37:00.437 --> 37:02.301
these things you're
talking about,

37:02.303 --> 37:04.970
these moth men and Mary.

37:06.369 --> 37:08.068
There are all kinds of accounts.

37:08.070 --> 37:11.234
The only thing, the only
thing that's factual is

37:11.236 --> 37:14.401
a statistically high
number of people

37:14.403 --> 37:17.933
have died or disappeared, I
don't even know if they've died,

37:17.935 --> 37:19.534
I just know they're gone.

37:19.536 --> 37:21.068
Vanished.

37:21.070 --> 37:24.201
I'm here to tell you that I
wanna wash my hands of this,

37:24.203 --> 37:26.101
I don't wanna talk to
people about this anymore,

37:26.103 --> 37:28.601
I don't wanna draw
people to this area.

37:28.603 --> 37:32.501
I don't want any
more people to die.

37:32.503 --> 37:34.667
Okay, Mike, I really appreciate
what you're telling us

37:34.669 --> 37:36.701
and I really respect that.

37:36.703 --> 37:41.200
I was curious about the
asylum, Mary in the woods,

37:41.202 --> 37:44.901
the old asylum that
burned down many years.

37:44.903 --> 37:47.368
We've heard stories
of a hell hound

37:47.370 --> 37:49.934
with these red, glowing eyes
that lives in the woods.

37:49.936 --> 37:53.271
Just don't go
into those woods.

37:54.470 --> 37:55.568
So
what you're saying,

37:55.570 --> 37:56.934
it's a very dangerous
place to go.

37:56.936 --> 38:00.034
It's extremely
dangerous, in my opinion,

38:00.036 --> 38:01.037
extremely dangerous.

38:02.536 --> 38:05.301
You have to be a
certain level of stupid

38:05.303 --> 38:06.434
to walk in there at this point,

38:06.436 --> 38:07.969
after everything I've told you.

38:12.403 --> 38:13.204
Don't do it.

38:15.036 --> 38:17.137
What can happen
if we go in there at night?

38:19.738 --> 38:20.671
You never know

38:22.770 --> 38:24.335
who's gonna come after you.

38:38.502 --> 38:39.568
Oh, it's cold out there.

38:39.570 --> 38:40.737
Yeah.

38:41.802 --> 38:43.037
So what are you thinking?

38:45.636 --> 38:47.901
I don't know, he
was very negative

38:47.903 --> 38:49.571
on us going down
to Mount Misery.

38:50.436 --> 38:51.270
I know.

38:52.437 --> 38:53.935
That wasn't really
a good meeting,

38:53.937 --> 38:55.801
I thought it was
gonna be better.

38:55.803 --> 38:58.735
I know, it's
kind of scary, I mean,

38:58.737 --> 39:01.001
I don't feel good
about it any more.

39:01.003 --> 39:02.767
What are we doing?

39:02.769 --> 39:04.235
Well, we came all
the way from Florida,

39:04.237 --> 39:06.801
so we might as well go down
there and check it out.

39:06.803 --> 39:07.638
We're here.

39:08.537 --> 39:09.638
Are you sure?

39:10.537 --> 39:11.834
Yeah, I think we should do it,

39:11.836 --> 39:13.601
we came all the way
from Florida to do this

39:13.603 --> 39:15.200
so let's make it happen.

39:15.202 --> 39:16.969
All right,
all right then.

39:18.471 --> 39:21.000
Well, I wanna see
some ghosts anyway.

39:21.002 --> 39:22.668
That's
what we came here for.

39:28.770 --> 39:30.770
Babe, as we drive
through these woods...

39:34.169 --> 39:37.069
You know this is the highest
point on Long Island?

39:39.837 --> 39:42.736
And all these houses that are
built by these people today,

39:44.103 --> 39:46.104
these houses are basically
built on cursed land

39:47.536 --> 39:49.404
and the people probably
don't even know it.

39:53.336 --> 39:54.504
Somewhere around here

39:56.103 --> 39:57.336
is this old inn.

40:05.203 --> 40:06.835
This is it.

40:06.837 --> 40:08.471
Wow, I can't
believe we found it.

40:11.836 --> 40:13.003
This place looks spooky.

40:16.069 --> 40:18.236
Look at the windows,
they're very creepy looking.

40:21.702 --> 40:23.671
Wow, this place looks
very, very spooky.

40:26.436 --> 40:28.200
I read about this story though

40:28.202 --> 40:29.470
about these two children,

40:30.336 --> 40:31.769
supposedly they went missing

40:34.136 --> 40:35.701
and the townspeople
would actually come here

40:35.703 --> 40:37.867
and sit around the fireplace,

40:37.869 --> 40:39.301
talking how they're
gonna have a search

40:39.303 --> 40:40.437
to find these children.

40:45.836 --> 40:47.037
As the weeks went by,

40:48.837 --> 40:50.502
they went searching
through the woods over here

40:50.504 --> 40:51.336
at Mount Misery

40:52.836 --> 40:54.801
and they finally
found the children,

40:54.803 --> 40:56.034
they found them mutilated,

40:56.036 --> 40:58.237
body parts scattered all
throughout the hills.

41:00.170 --> 41:02.468
They actually buried the
kids in the old cemetery

41:02.470 --> 41:04.604
downtown on Main
Street in Huntington.

41:07.003 --> 41:08.304
Wow, look at the windows.

41:09.335 --> 41:10.603
If they could only speak.

41:25.803 --> 41:29.004
This is the back to
Mount Misery Road.

41:47.868 --> 41:50.536
There's an old timer on a horse.

41:51.436 --> 41:52.437
I see that.

41:55.037 --> 41:56.268
Wow, that's cool.

41:56.270 --> 41:57.401
Isn't
that cool, Buzi?

41:57.403 --> 41:58.636
That's very cool.

42:01.635 --> 42:03.700
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Buzi.

42:03.702 --> 42:05.933
- Hey, babe.
- You believe that we're here?

42:05.935 --> 42:07.768
- I can't believe we are here.
- Mount Misery Road,

42:07.770 --> 42:09.235
I can't believe we're here.

42:09.237 --> 42:12.534
So we gonna search
for this mental hospital today?

42:12.536 --> 42:14.235
Yes, we're
gonna try to find

42:14.237 --> 42:16.667
the house, hospital,
that was built

42:16.669 --> 42:19.103
in the 1700s for
the crazy, insane.

42:20.403 --> 42:22.404
That's gonna
be adventure today.

42:24.104 --> 42:25.701
Yeah, we're
gonna get through the woods

42:25.703 --> 42:28.304
and see if we can get a
chance to see the old asylum.

42:29.537 --> 42:31.137
See if we can find
the foundation.

42:33.002 --> 42:35.867
Wow, this
is Mount Misery?

42:35.869 --> 42:38.701
Yeah, this is where
the road starts.

42:38.703 --> 42:40.535
Right over here
is where the road

42:40.537 --> 42:44.435
starts where the wooded areas,
past this tree over here.

42:44.437 --> 42:45.271
Yeah?

42:47.403 --> 42:49.334
Babe, this is the
Mount Misery Road

42:49.336 --> 42:51.435
that we finally came to.

42:51.437 --> 42:54.001
- I know, babe.
- We finally are here!

42:54.003 --> 42:55.268
I'm blown away.

42:55.270 --> 42:58.200
From Florida to New
York to Long Island

42:58.202 --> 42:59.600
to Mount Misery Road,

42:59.602 --> 43:02.035
we've been waiting
for this for months.

43:03.569 --> 43:05.768
You know, Mothman has
been seen in these woods,

43:05.770 --> 43:07.933
during the day,
Mothman has been seen,

43:07.935 --> 43:09.601
there's been sightings.

43:09.603 --> 43:11.334
People that were just
walking their dogs

43:11.336 --> 43:13.437
had seen Mothman
jumping from trees.

43:14.336 --> 43:15.666
Just amazing.

43:15.668 --> 43:17.000
So hopefully today
we'll get a chance

43:17.002 --> 43:18.334
to see if we can see Mothman.

43:19.769 --> 43:21.801
And at night, people
have seen the hell hound.

43:21.803 --> 43:23.467
People have found that dog,

43:23.469 --> 43:26.402
they had seen that dog
with those glowing eyes.

43:26.404 --> 43:28.499
It's just amazing
that we're here.

43:28.501 --> 43:29.867
So today what we're
gonna do, babe,

43:29.869 --> 43:31.900
is we're gonna see if
we can find the asylum.

43:31.902 --> 43:33.700
We're gonna see if we can
find the old remnants,

43:33.702 --> 43:35.301
the old foundation

43:35.303 --> 43:37.437
and see if we can
see where it was.

43:38.802 --> 43:42.601
Supposedly there's Mary
in the woods somewhere.

43:42.603 --> 43:44.067
Well, I
don't wanna see that.

43:44.069 --> 43:45.900
Ah, that would be great
if we finally see her,

43:45.902 --> 43:47.267
that would be awesome.

43:47.269 --> 43:48.600
- No.
- Are you sure?

43:48.602 --> 43:50.434
- No, I don't wanna see that.
- Come on!

43:50.436 --> 43:52.500
It'll be fun, we're gonna
take a lot of pictures today

43:52.502 --> 43:53.901
- and we're gonna see...
- That's crazy.

43:53.903 --> 43:55.268
Get a chance to
see some ghosts

43:55.270 --> 43:56.567
and maybe later
when it gets dark

43:56.569 --> 43:58.401
we'll see if we
can find some orbs.

43:58.403 --> 43:59.700
- You're crazy.
- Come on, babe, let's go.

43:59.702 --> 44:00.536
Kiss.

44:04.437 --> 44:05.271
Look.

44:06.236 --> 44:07.967
There's snow here.

44:07.969 --> 44:09.137
Oh my god.

44:10.903 --> 44:12.367
Can you believe that?

44:12.369 --> 44:14.168
Wow, we don't have
snow like this in Florida.

44:14.170 --> 44:15.934
No, we don't, no.

44:15.936 --> 44:17.168
Oh my god, that's pretty cool.

44:17.170 --> 44:19.634
I've never
seen snow, it's amazing.

44:19.636 --> 44:21.901
No, I've seen snow.

44:21.903 --> 44:22.970
But it's really cold.

44:24.836 --> 44:27.500
Okay, so let's see
if we can find the remnants

44:27.502 --> 44:28.403
of the asylum.

44:31.436 --> 44:34.334
Been a lot of sightings
around here and everything.

44:34.336 --> 44:36.033
That's haunted.

44:36.035 --> 44:38.167
Can't
believe this, we're here.

44:38.169 --> 44:40.534
We came all the way from
Florida to see this.

45:00.536 --> 45:03.900
Wow, this is the
top of the mountain.

45:03.902 --> 45:04.869
- This is it.
- Wow.

45:06.103 --> 45:09.833
It's amazing.

45:09.835 --> 45:11.270
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

45:22.535 --> 45:24.602
It seems like there's
nobody but us here.

45:25.768 --> 45:27.169
I know,
the place looks empty.

45:28.369 --> 45:30.500
I guess we're the
only people here.

45:30.502 --> 45:33.103
Yeah, there is not
even one person walking.

45:34.902 --> 45:37.369
Babe, give me the camera,
I want to film you now.

45:42.503 --> 45:44.767
Wow,
check that ravine out.

45:44.769 --> 45:46.302
Oh my god.

45:46.304 --> 45:48.101
Check
this out over here.

45:48.103 --> 45:49.301
Look at this.

45:49.303 --> 45:50.736
Oh my
god, it goes down.

45:54.202 --> 45:55.868
This is why they
call it Mount Misery Road,

45:55.870 --> 45:57.401
look at this ravine.

45:57.403 --> 45:58.236
Wow.

45:59.768 --> 46:01.334
Try to
get a wagon train

46:01.336 --> 46:04.300
coming up this valley
here, forget it.

46:04.302 --> 46:06.202
- That's spooky.
- It's very spooky.

46:07.203 --> 46:08.667
- Hey babe.
- Hey Buzi.

46:08.669 --> 46:10.068
- Hey babe.
- Hey babe.

46:10.070 --> 46:11.600
- Hey.
- Cold.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.433
- I know!
- It's cold here today.

46:13.435 --> 46:15.435
I know, I know.

46:16.869 --> 46:18.737
Let's go up this
road over here, babe, come on.

46:29.535 --> 46:31.168
Oh my god, babe, look!

46:31.170 --> 46:32.800
Look, a cross.

46:32.802 --> 46:34.100
Oh shit!

46:34.102 --> 46:37.235
Wow, a black
cross in the woods.

46:37.237 --> 46:39.102
Oh shit, oh my god.

46:39.104 --> 46:40.767
That's creepy.

46:40.769 --> 46:43.200
That's
definitely creepy, man.

46:43.202 --> 46:45.000
Maybe that's a warning?

46:45.002 --> 46:46.235
That's creepy.

46:46.237 --> 46:49.303
- Let's get outta here, babe.
- Okay.

46:55.736 --> 46:58.503
Babe, babe, come
here, come here!

47:02.702 --> 47:05.369
Babe, come over here, oh my god.

47:06.271 --> 47:07.370
Look at this.

47:09.302 --> 47:11.134
- What is that?
- Wow.

47:11.136 --> 47:12.699
Oh my
god, what is that?

47:12.701 --> 47:16.134
Is this a part of that
hospital, you think?

47:16.136 --> 47:17.467
Yes, it could
be part of the asylum.

47:17.469 --> 47:19.500
- Yes.
- Like one of the posts.

47:19.502 --> 47:20.801
- The wood posts.
- Look here!

47:20.803 --> 47:22.600
- Look here.
- It's amazing.

47:22.602 --> 47:24.303
It's all,
like, you know?

47:25.668 --> 47:27.034
Oh, it's
cool that you found that.

47:27.036 --> 47:28.070
Wow, yeah.

47:29.436 --> 47:31.070
Let's go find some more stuff.

47:42.903 --> 47:44.768
Come on, babe.

47:44.770 --> 47:46.135
I'm right
behind you, Buzi.

47:50.902 --> 47:53.034
Buzi, it's gotta be
here in these woods.

47:53.036 --> 47:54.403
Yeah, I know.

47:56.002 --> 47:57.601
Because we were walking
for like two hours

47:57.603 --> 47:58.904
by now and nothing.

48:00.234 --> 48:02.068
The maps
say it's in this area.

48:02.070 --> 48:03.703
I can't believe
we can't find it.

48:05.069 --> 48:07.501
I hope we're
gonna find something today.

48:07.503 --> 48:09.903
It's gotta
be around here somewhere.

48:15.969 --> 48:17.302
- Be careful!
- Yeah.

48:22.368 --> 48:25.267
Oh my god, babe, what's this?

48:25.269 --> 48:27.334
Do you see this?

48:27.336 --> 48:28.833
Holy shit.

48:28.835 --> 48:30.266
Whoa whoa, that
looks like an outcropping

48:30.268 --> 48:31.901
of foundation stones.

48:31.903 --> 48:33.467
Wow!

48:34.903 --> 48:36.000
Oh my god.

48:36.002 --> 48:37.199
Oh my god.

48:37.201 --> 48:39.467
Oh my god, look at that!

48:39.469 --> 48:42.701
It looks like it
could be pieces of the asylum.

48:42.703 --> 48:43.503
Oh my god.

48:44.603 --> 48:46.800
That's the foundation
of the hospital.

48:46.802 --> 48:48.467
I'm sure!

48:48.469 --> 48:49.435
Oh wow!

48:50.436 --> 48:51.701
That's so cool!

48:51.703 --> 48:54.070
That's gotta
be pieces of the asylum.

48:56.236 --> 48:57.403
Wow, god.

48:58.702 --> 49:01.134
It looks like the
foundation of the hospital.

49:01.136 --> 49:02.634
You know, that's
exactly what I think it is.

49:02.636 --> 49:04.001
Yeah.

49:04.003 --> 49:05.501
- It's gotta be.
- Look at that over there!

49:05.503 --> 49:06.867
Look, there's
more of it over there.

49:06.869 --> 49:09.702
Oh my
god, let's go look.

49:11.937 --> 49:14.034
It looks like the
front entrance of something.

49:14.036 --> 49:15.203
It was here.

49:20.902 --> 49:22.234
Look at this.

49:22.236 --> 49:24.701
Look, it looks like a,

49:24.703 --> 49:25.904
like a burn.

49:27.669 --> 49:29.101
Is there some markings?

49:29.103 --> 49:29.768
There's a
marking over there as well.

49:29.770 --> 49:31.034
Yes.

49:31.036 --> 49:32.434
- In the cement.
- Here?

49:32.436 --> 49:33.270
Yes.

49:34.803 --> 49:39.133
Look, look, I'm
sure it means something.

49:39.135 --> 49:41.533
Wow, I
can't believe this.

49:41.535 --> 49:42.370
That's amazing.

49:45.334 --> 49:47.068
What is that,
is that dirt or a burn?

49:47.070 --> 49:48.200
Looks
like it's burnt.

49:48.202 --> 49:50.901
It's burned, right?

49:50.903 --> 49:52.466
- Huh.
- Wow.

49:52.468 --> 49:54.566
That's awesome, babe!

49:54.568 --> 49:56.535
That looks
like a burnt mark.

49:57.936 --> 50:00.070
This is what we were
looking for all this time.

50:01.269 --> 50:02.333
Let's see
what else we can find.

50:02.335 --> 50:03.168
Okay.

50:07.502 --> 50:09.533
Babe, I'm getting tired.

50:09.535 --> 50:11.099
Do you have reception
on your phone?

50:11.101 --> 50:12.968
No, the
reception doesn't work here.

50:12.970 --> 50:15.367
I just checked it a second
ago and it doesn't work.

50:15.369 --> 50:16.169
Shit.

50:18.201 --> 50:19.603
I hope you know the way back.

50:20.736 --> 50:22.366
I don't wanna get lost.

50:22.368 --> 50:23.633
Well, I'm
sure we'll be able

50:23.635 --> 50:24.903
to get outta here somehow.

50:38.368 --> 50:40.065
Hey, Charlie?

50:40.067 --> 50:41.566
Yeah, Buzi?

50:41.568 --> 50:43.200
Can I ask you something?

50:43.202 --> 50:44.934
Yeah, what's up?

50:44.936 --> 50:47.766
I have a question
because I heard

50:47.768 --> 50:50.267
that in these woods, you know,

50:50.269 --> 50:53.501
when there was a fire in
that hospital building?

50:53.503 --> 50:56.833
There was some woman and
she was really depressed

50:56.835 --> 50:59.300
and obsessed and I don't know

50:59.302 --> 51:01.334
what's going on
with that woman but

51:01.336 --> 51:02.900
do you know anything about it?

51:02.902 --> 51:05.366
Like what was her
name, anything?

51:05.368 --> 51:06.601
Yeah,
her name was Mary.

51:06.603 --> 51:08.133
- Mary was the psycho.
- Okay.

51:08.135 --> 51:09.933
She
was the crazy girl,

51:09.935 --> 51:14.801
supposedly, that she burned
all the people in the hospital.

51:14.803 --> 51:16.067
No!

51:16.069 --> 51:19.801
- Oh my god.
- 25 patients burned with her,

51:19.803 --> 51:22.900
or supposedly she got
out and she survived.

51:22.902 --> 51:26.233
But the whole thing
behind Mount Misery

51:26.235 --> 51:29.132
is that she is seen
in the woods, walking.

51:29.134 --> 51:30.334
- This is from, you know...
- No!

51:30.336 --> 51:31.601
Two, three
hundred years ago.

51:31.603 --> 51:33.099
She's seen in the
woods still walking?

51:33.101 --> 51:35.901
Supposedly she
wears a white hospital robe.

51:35.903 --> 51:38.199
- And she has this...
- Oh my god.

51:38.201 --> 51:39.935
Ghostly appearance

51:39.937 --> 51:42.603
and she hovers or
lurks in the woods.

51:43.535 --> 51:44.800
Are you serious?

51:44.802 --> 51:47.166
- Oh my god.
- And there's been screams

51:47.168 --> 51:49.999
and howls and moans
from other patients

51:50.001 --> 51:51.768
that walk the woods
and supposedly...

51:51.770 --> 51:53.601
- Oh my god.
- People have seen them

51:53.603 --> 51:56.065
- around the area here.
- I can't hear it anymore.

51:56.067 --> 51:57.566
Are you serious about it?

51:57.568 --> 51:59.866
She's like walking around
like that, like a ghost,

51:59.868 --> 52:00.770
like a real ghost?

52:01.903 --> 52:03.801
Oh my god, I wanna
get out of here, babe.

52:03.803 --> 52:06.334
I mean, let's get out of here.

52:06.336 --> 52:07.467
I'm really,

52:07.469 --> 52:08.934
I'm really scared.

52:08.936 --> 52:10.100
I've gotta remember
where we are though, first.

52:10.102 --> 52:11.333
I don't know where we are.

52:11.335 --> 52:13.166
I don't know, let's
just go, let's just go.

52:13.168 --> 52:14.400
All right,
hold, all right?

52:14.402 --> 52:15.633
We've gotta get our
bearings straight here

52:15.635 --> 52:16.567
because I don't
know where we are,

52:16.569 --> 52:18.099
we're gonna get lost now.

52:18.101 --> 52:19.466
We're deep into the woods here.

52:19.468 --> 52:22.133
Walk behind me, okay?

52:22.135 --> 52:23.100
I don't
know if we're going

52:23.102 --> 52:24.466
the right way though, babe.

52:24.468 --> 52:27.333
I think, this doesn't
look familiar.

52:27.335 --> 52:28.202
Let's go.

52:29.637 --> 52:31.467
Babe, come on.

52:31.469 --> 52:32.967
Slow down,
where are you going?

52:32.969 --> 52:35.700
Come on, let's go, let's
go, I wanna get out of here.

52:35.702 --> 52:36.999
- Let's go.
- Everything's okay.

52:37.001 --> 52:38.203
Babe, hurry up,
Charlie, come on!

52:40.001 --> 52:41.232
Buzi, relax.

52:41.234 --> 52:43.534
I don't want
to be here anymore.

52:43.536 --> 52:44.370
No.

52:50.303 --> 52:51.834
I think
we're getting lost

52:51.836 --> 52:53.367
but I think, let's see if
we can find our way back.

52:53.369 --> 52:54.203
Okay.

52:55.202 --> 52:56.500
Walk behind me, okay?

52:56.502 --> 52:58.136
- I'm following you.
- Okay.

53:02.670 --> 53:04.336
Don't leave me here.

53:10.969 --> 53:11.802
Hey, babe?

53:13.601 --> 53:16.134
- Babe?
- Yeah, babe, what's up?

53:16.136 --> 53:17.734
I need to go to the bathroom.

53:17.736 --> 53:19.100
- No, really?
- Yes!

53:21.002 --> 53:22.233
I'm gonna see you in
like five minutes.

53:22.235 --> 53:23.400
All right,
I'll just stay here.

53:23.402 --> 53:24.900
I'm gonna look around
with the camera.

53:24.902 --> 53:26.466
- All right, okay.
- And just see around,

53:26.468 --> 53:28.033
- take a look.
- Okay.

53:28.035 --> 53:29.032
Just try to go
behind the tree over there

53:29.034 --> 53:30.266
- if you can.
- Okay, I will.

53:30.268 --> 53:31.300
All right,
I'll be right here.

53:31.302 --> 53:32.469
Okay.

53:51.503 --> 53:53.533
This
is just amazing.

53:53.535 --> 53:55.999
I feel like somebody's
looking at me, watching me.

53:56.001 --> 53:58.269
Why am I getting this feeling?

53:59.468 --> 54:01.333
What's going on here?

54:01.335 --> 54:03.470
Something's happening.

54:06.002 --> 54:08.234
The woods, something's
going on in these woods.

54:08.236 --> 54:10.069
Let me see what's
happening over here.

54:15.803 --> 54:16.936
Just so weird.

54:38.068 --> 54:38.902
Babe?

54:44.535 --> 54:46.967
Hey, babe, where are you?

54:51.702 --> 54:52.535
Charlie?

54:57.368 --> 54:58.670
Charlie, where are you?

55:02.969 --> 55:04.403
Charlie, come on.

55:06.934 --> 55:07.769
Charlie?

55:09.835 --> 55:12.168
Come on, stop playing games.

55:16.902 --> 55:17.737
Charlie?

55:20.102 --> 55:20.936
Charlie!

55:23.436 --> 55:25.370
Charlie, where are you?

55:31.669 --> 55:32.502
Oh my god!

55:36.302 --> 55:37.136
Charlie!

55:40.202 --> 55:42.567
Oh my god, where are you?

55:42.569 --> 55:45.267
You said you're not
gonna leave me here.

55:45.269 --> 55:46.534
Oh my god.

55:46.536 --> 55:49.033
What am I gonna do right now?

55:49.035 --> 55:50.501
Charlie?

55:50.503 --> 55:51.766
Charlie?

55:51.768 --> 55:52.602
Oh my god.

55:54.202 --> 55:56.799
Okay, okay, I'm gonna
get it together.

55:56.801 --> 55:58.734
Calm down, okay, calm down.

55:58.736 --> 56:00.033
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.

56:00.035 --> 56:01.734
We're just gonna go
through these woods.

56:01.736 --> 56:05.367
Okay, I'm gonna just go and
it's gonna be all right.

56:05.369 --> 56:06.733
I'll find a way out.

56:06.735 --> 56:08.634
Okay, okay, let's go.

56:08.636 --> 56:10.067
Okay, I'm going.

56:10.069 --> 56:13.634
Oh my god!

56:40.636 --> 56:41.799
Okay.

56:45.868 --> 56:46.701
Charlie!

56:58.068 --> 56:58.902
Babe!

57:05.202 --> 57:06.036
Oh god.

57:15.069 --> 57:15.903
Charlie?

57:20.636 --> 57:21.470
Okay.

57:25.468 --> 57:26.302
Charlie?

57:31.435 --> 57:32.269
Fuck.

57:43.668 --> 57:44.503
Oh god.

57:49.368 --> 57:50.202
It's okay.

57:54.470 --> 57:55.302
Oh.

57:57.101 --> 57:58.701
Ah, shit!

58:24.002 --> 58:25.403
Okay, I'm gonna go this way.

58:31.502 --> 58:32.469
Where did you go?

58:54.468 --> 58:55.302
Charlie?

58:59.734 --> 59:00.568
Charlie!

59:11.702 --> 59:13.333
Hey!

59:13.335 --> 59:14.403
Anybody here?

59:18.102 --> 59:18.936
Oh god.

59:20.368 --> 59:23.900
Fuck.

59:23.902 --> 59:25.532
Where'd he go?

59:25.534 --> 59:28.033
He didn't go somewhere far.

59:28.035 --> 59:30.203
He must be somewhere here.

59:31.535 --> 59:32.370
Charlie!

59:39.701 --> 59:42.032
What am I gonna do now?

59:42.034 --> 59:43.935
What am I gonna do now?

59:46.701 --> 59:50.401
I don't even know
where to go, fuck.

01:00:08.969 --> 01:00:10.366
Shit.

01:00:15.436 --> 01:00:16.700
Okay.

01:00:16.702 --> 01:00:18.569
It's okay, that
was just the wind.

01:00:19.502 --> 01:00:21.203
It was just the wind.

01:00:32.467 --> 01:00:35.666
I can't walk like that anymore.

01:00:35.668 --> 01:00:39.632
I wanna be home, I
just wanna go home.

01:00:43.934 --> 01:00:46.500
Oh my god, oh my god.

01:00:57.467 --> 01:00:58.968
Okay, okay.

01:01:00.436 --> 01:01:02.602
Where's that fucking road?

01:01:06.135 --> 01:01:08.232
Where did you go?

01:01:08.234 --> 01:01:10.403
Where the fuck did you go?

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:14.733
It's getting late, I can't,

01:01:14.735 --> 01:01:16.769
I can't be here any more.

01:01:18.868 --> 01:01:21.199
It's crazy, it's crazy.

01:01:21.201 --> 01:01:23.932
The fucking phone doesn't work.

01:01:23.934 --> 01:01:24.735
Fuck!

01:01:26.403 --> 01:01:31.099
Where is the way out,
where is the way out?

01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:31.935
Hello?

01:01:33.302 --> 01:01:34.136
Charlie?

01:01:36.435 --> 01:01:37.270
Charlie?

01:01:40.935 --> 01:01:41.768
Oh my god,

01:01:42.868 --> 01:01:45.866
it's okay, it's gonna be okay.

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:48.334
It's okay.

01:01:48.336 --> 01:01:50.599
It's okay, it's okay.

01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:53.735
Let's try the phone,
let's try the phone.

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:56.168
Okay.

01:01:57.301 --> 01:01:58.600
Fuck!

01:01:58.602 --> 01:02:00.466
Let's try it again.

01:02:00.468 --> 01:02:01.968
Fucking no signal.

01:02:03.335 --> 01:02:05.034
There's no signal.

01:02:05.036 --> 01:02:06.398
Let's try from here.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.500
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

01:02:09.502 --> 01:02:11.069
It's gonna be okay.

01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:16.270
Try it here.

01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:20.866
Oh my god, come on.

01:02:20.868 --> 01:02:21.668
Come on.

01:02:22.634 --> 01:02:23.434
Come on!

01:02:44.601 --> 01:02:45.434
Okay.

01:02:48.735 --> 01:02:52.300
You told me you're not
gonna leave me here.

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:53.469
You told me...

01:03:17.901 --> 01:03:18.766
Oh my god.

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:25.299
I wanna go home.

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.267
I wanna go home.

01:04:05.368 --> 01:04:06.434
That's crazy.

01:04:07.868 --> 01:04:10.799
That's fucking crazy, I
can't believe I did that.

01:04:10.801 --> 01:04:12.701
I can't believe I
fucking came here.

01:04:13.568 --> 01:04:15.334
Why the fuck I came here?

01:04:16.734 --> 01:04:19.665
This is not happening,
this is all wrong.

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:21.832
This is not happening.

01:04:21.834 --> 01:04:23.799
This is not happening,

01:04:23.801 --> 01:04:26.468
this is, this is just so wrong!

01:04:28.602 --> 01:04:30.732
I just wanna go home, please,

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:33.467
please let me get out of here.

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:34.335
I wanna go home.

01:04:35.901 --> 01:04:38.033
Oh my god, oh my god.

01:04:38.035 --> 01:04:39.366
I feel like something,

01:04:39.368 --> 01:04:41.133
I feel like something...

01:04:42.936 --> 01:04:47.733
Something is watching,
something is watching me.

01:04:47.735 --> 01:04:48.569
Oh my god.

01:04:50.502 --> 01:04:52.433
No, why?

01:04:52.435 --> 01:04:54.532
Why have I fucking done this?

01:04:54.534 --> 01:04:55.533
Fuck!

01:04:55.535 --> 01:04:57.633
Why the fuck I've done this?

01:04:57.635 --> 01:04:58.469
Oh my god.

01:05:16.435 --> 01:05:17.269
It's dark.

01:05:18.902 --> 01:05:20.400
There is no way out.

01:05:20.402 --> 01:05:23.465
There is no fucking way out.

01:05:23.467 --> 01:05:24.899
Where I'm gonna go out?

01:05:24.901 --> 01:05:26.466
Where is the way out?

01:05:26.468 --> 01:05:28.966
Where is the way out?

01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:34.435
What was that?

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:39.801
What was that?

01:05:42.302 --> 01:05:43.601
Oh my god, okay.

01:05:44.767 --> 01:05:46.366
Okay.

01:05:50.335 --> 01:05:52.799
I just wanna get out of here!

01:05:52.801 --> 01:05:55.234
I just wanna get out of here!

01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:01.199
Where is everybody?

01:06:01.201 --> 01:06:02.834
Where is Charlie?

01:06:02.836 --> 01:06:04.499
Where are you, babe?

01:06:04.501 --> 01:06:05.334
Babe?

01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:08.500
Babe, please help me.

01:06:08.502 --> 01:06:09.736
Please help me!

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:12.134
Anybody, help me.

01:06:13.367 --> 01:06:15.366
What the fuck I've done?

01:06:15.368 --> 01:06:16.202
Fuck!

01:06:22.767 --> 01:06:24.099
I have to get out, I have to,

01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:25.302
I have to get out.

01:06:26.468 --> 01:06:31.401
There's someone, there
is somebody watching me.

01:06:32.467 --> 01:06:34.800
I feel there is
somebody behind my back.

01:06:34.802 --> 01:06:38.999
There is somebody
behind my back, oh god.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:48.935
My god.

01:06:50.402 --> 01:06:51.235
Oh my god.

01:07:09.133 --> 01:07:12.134
I can't breathe,
oh my god, I can't.

01:07:13.036 --> 01:07:14.369
I can't breathe.

01:07:19.634 --> 01:07:21.567
I've gotta calm down.

01:07:21.569 --> 01:07:24.167
Just calm down, just calm down.

01:07:26.134 --> 01:07:27.902
I've gotta wait here.

01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:32.501
There is nothing I can do.

01:07:41.435 --> 01:07:42.269
Oh my god!

01:07:43.902 --> 01:07:46.302
What was that, what was that?

01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:49.900
Who is that?

01:07:49.902 --> 01:07:51.068
Somebody here?

01:07:58.235 --> 01:08:00.933
We're coming for you.

01:08:00.935 --> 01:08:04.435
Oh my god, there is
someone watching me.

01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:07.300
There is someone watching me.

01:08:07.302 --> 01:08:08.632
I can feel it.

01:08:08.634 --> 01:08:10.398
Get the fuck out of me!

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.736
Get the fuck away!

01:08:13.935 --> 01:08:16.836
Get the fuck away,
don't follow me!

01:08:20.234 --> 01:08:23.265
What was that, what was that?

01:08:23.268 --> 01:08:25.365
Get the fuck away!

01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:30.102
Oh my god.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:33.765
Oh my god, who is that?

01:08:33.768 --> 01:08:36.599
Who is that, who is that?

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.332
Who is this?

01:08:38.335 --> 01:08:39.269
Who's that?

01:08:45.702 --> 01:08:48.166
Who is that, somebody here?

01:09:08.502 --> 01:09:09.335
Oh my god!

01:09:14.835 --> 01:09:16.234
Get away from me!

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:19.365
Stay away from me!

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.198
Stay away from me!

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.702
Stay away from me!

01:13:30.467 --> 01:13:33.666
Okay, so what's
important about this map

01:13:33.668 --> 01:13:38.432
is that it shows you all
the Native American tribes

01:13:38.434 --> 01:13:40.532
that lived in the area.

01:13:40.534 --> 01:13:43.898
It was not always
called Mount Misery.

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:46.667
To find that out, we're
gonna have to spend

01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:47.636
days in here.

01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:49.798
This is the dominant records.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.099
Again, this is
records, you know,

01:13:51.101 --> 01:13:52.698
from the different departments.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.465
Yeah, this is
Department of Records

01:13:54.467 --> 01:13:55.731
of the town of Huntington.

01:13:55.733 --> 01:13:59.800
What we have in here
is from 1664, 1653.
