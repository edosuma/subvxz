I came to a conundrum where it was like,

08:36.283 --> 08:38.717
a little bit thinner than
the first pair, so I was like,

08:38.818 --> 08:40.152
okay, what do I do here?

08:40.254 --> 08:41.688
- You know? It's...
- Sure, I'm

08:41.712 --> 08:43.145
- using garbage,
- (yawning)

08:43.224 --> 08:44.523
- (yawning)
- that I find...

08:44.625 --> 08:45.785
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Sorry.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.893
Did you miss what I
said at the front of it?

08:47.995 --> 08:49.328
I feel like I'm losing you.

08:49.430 --> 08:50.636
Did I show you the pockets thing?

08:50.661 --> 08:51.654
- Remember that?
- Oh, my God!

08:51.732 --> 08:53.932
Did you see "Rat Bachelor" last night?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.100
Uh, of course, I did.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.536
- It was the best episode!
- I actually wasn't...

08:57.638 --> 08:59.571
- I did not see that coming!
- I actually didn't see the episode,

08:59.673 --> 09:01.707
- so it's fine if we just don't...
- The guy doesn't have an arm!

09:01.809 --> 09:02.841
- No!
- Okay, this...

09:02.943 --> 09:04.710
This is not good. (chuckles)

09:06.113 --> 09:07.312
Phil, what's up, man?

09:07.415 --> 09:08.647
Oh, hey, dude, check this out.

09:08.783 --> 09:09.588
- Yeah.
- I was actually thinking

09:09.613 --> 09:10.389
about how you were saying

09:10.484 --> 09:11.850
- I was always good at making stuff,
- Right.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.953
So, what I did is, this is
actually a renewable energy conduit.

09:15.055 --> 09:15.472
Uh-huh. Okay.

09:15.497 --> 09:16.746
And what it does is it actually takes...

09:16.824 --> 09:18.323
Yeah, Mike, I need
you to forget about that.

09:18.426 --> 09:19.591
I need something new, dude.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.727
I need something
bigger, because right now

09:21.829 --> 09:24.196
pants are just not doing it anymore.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.931
Okay. Bigger, like, what?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.933
You can't put pants over
your entire body.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.536
That's it, dude! A whole suit of pants!

09:30.638 --> 09:32.404
Pantsuit by Phil.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.186
- I mean, by Mike.
- It's made by Mike. By Phil?

09:34.208 --> 09:36.088
No, no. It's made by
Mike... (whispers) by Phil.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.643
What was that last
thing? I didn't say anything.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.412
You're the... the dude, the genius.

09:40.514 --> 09:41.594

- Okay.

- And I've never been cool and smart.
- Okay.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.550
- My whole life, I'm a fucking loser.
- All right, I got it.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.285
Okay, I'll make it. Okay,
I'll make the pantsuit.

09:46.387 --> 09:47.686
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- This is

09:47.711 --> 09:49.111

09:49.190 --> 09:50.190
Dude, I honestly...

- Oh, thanks.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.091
- Did you see my tail piercing?
- Yeah.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.293
- Did it hurt?
- It hurt so bad.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.761
- Really?
- I, like, bit my tongue.

22:43.847 --> 22:45.046
Hey, Sharon.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.698
Oh, hi, Phil.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.733
Listen, about before,

22:48.835 --> 22:49.934
and about everything.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.569
I just wanted to apologize.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.772
That was really shitty of me to
lie to you and be dishonest.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.142
I just did it
because I really do like you,

22:58.245 --> 23:01.012
and I think you're super
cool, and no one else is nice to me,

23:01.114 --> 23:02.847
and I think it stems from...

23:02.949 --> 23:05.416
I didn't have many
friends when I was a kid...

23:05.518 --> 23:08.152
Oh, my God, Phil's getting a boner!

23:08.255 --> 23:09.587
- What? Oh, my God!
- That's a boner!

23:09.689 --> 23:11.089
- Oh, shit. It's not...
- What the fuck?!

23:11.124 --> 23:12.444
- No, no, no, no, Sharon.
- Oh my God!

23:12.459 --> 23:13.260
Sharon, relax, it's 'cause

23:13.285 --> 23:14.116
- I like you so much.
- Ugh!

23:14.194 --> 23:15.994
I'm nervous. I'm just
really nervous when I'm around you.

23:16.096 --> 23:17.996
- Someone call campus security!
- No, no, you don't have to...

23:18.098 --> 23:19.130
- Campus security!
- Guys, drop it!

23:19.232 --> 23:20.965
- Call campus security!
- Sharon, I'm sorry!

23:21.067 --> 23:22.500
- Campus security.
- We're fine.

23:22.585 --> 23:24.202
- What's the problem here?
- This man has a boner!

23:24.304 --> 23:25.250
And you need to remove it

23:25.275 --> 23:26.355
- from the premises.
- No...

23:26.373 --> 23:27.650
- Get rid of that boner.
- Sir, it's

23:27.675 --> 23:29.231
called a nervous erection, actually.

23:29.309 --> 23:30.144
- You're getting Tasered.
- Sir,

23:30.169 --> 23:31.033
you don't have to Tase me.

23:31.111 --> 23:32.543
- It's not gonna help.
- The Taser's gotta warm up.

23:32.646 --> 23:33.484
- I don't feel safe.
- Are you

23:33.509 --> 23:34.603
really gonna tase me right now?

23:34.681 --> 23:36.414
- Ooh, it's warming up.
- Put it back!

23:36.516 --> 23:38.616
I can't put it back,
Dana, that's not how they work!

23:38.718 --> 23:39.718
Oh, Taser's warmed up.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.119
- Here we go.
- No, don't... No, no, no, no!

23:41.221 --> 23:42.987
- (electricity buzzes)
- Oh, God!

23:43.073 --> 23:44.238
- Relax.
- Sharon!

23:44.357 --> 23:45.740
- Aah!
- One more time.

23:45.859 --> 23:46.991
Argh, fuck it!

23:47.077 --> 23:48.242
Sorry... Sharon...

23:48.361 --> 23:50.278
No! Oh, God!

23:50.363 --> 23:53.398
♪ ♪

23:56.536 --> 23:58.122
I think it started with,

23:58.147 --> 24:00.062
you know, I was one of 36,

24:00.140 --> 24:01.472
- so it was...
- Small family.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.842
Yeah. But, you know, even
with such a small family,

24:04.944 --> 24:06.344
they never looked at me, you know?

24:06.446 --> 24:07.136
I was just sort of the

24:07.161 --> 24:08.070
- runt of the litter.
- Right.

24:08.148 --> 24:09.171
So, no one really paid

24:09.196 --> 24:10.405
- attention to you.
- Yeah.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.883
- All right, I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.818
- We good?
- Yeah, we're good, Marc.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.920
I feel good.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.554
Pow! I just shit my pants.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.657
And if I wasn't wearing
them, it'd be on the ground.

24:19.759 --> 24:20.759
All right, I get it.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.927
All right. I guess Phil's got a point.
