00:52.352 --> 00:57.689
(Alison)
My best friend Lily
thought she was drowning.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.092
Drowning in the Salton Sea.

01:04.364 --> 01:08.300
Even though the water was
too polluted to step foot in

01:08.302 --> 01:13.272
and left everything in our
town either dying or dead.

01:21.614 --> 01:24.516
(Margaret)
Lily?

01:24.518 --> 01:25.751
[knocking]

01:25.753 --> 01:29.021
Are you okay?

01:29.023 --> 01:30.122
Hello?

01:33.626 --> 01:36.195
(Alison)
Lily was determined
to never let it get her.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.463
[scream]

02:09.162 --> 02:10.629
[scream]

03:15.528 --> 03:17.329
I'll see you later, okay?

03:24.537 --> 03:27.839
Hey, Aunt Bonnie!
Good morning.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.510
You're like
a fucking tornado, kid.
You know that?

03:31.512 --> 03:34.379
There's my
poor little cousin.
You're late.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.415
Did you get my cigs?
Yeah.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.320
These come open now?

03:41.322 --> 03:43.855
[baby crying]

03:43.857 --> 03:47.893
Hey, handsome.
Shh. Shh.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.765
You trying to burp him
or break his neck?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.801
God, I really can't
do anything right today.

03:55.803 --> 03:59.338
Well, I don't
want him ending up
with shaken kid syndrome.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.806
I might be
doing him a favor.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.277
What does that mean?

04:05.279 --> 04:06.378
Huh?

04:17.457 --> 04:21.293
You want this?
Hmm?

04:21.295 --> 04:24.463
Yeah, yum.

04:24.465 --> 04:28.267
Look at the cartoons.
What's happening?

04:28.269 --> 04:30.502
Look, he's thinking
about a bird.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.272
He's flying
like a bird.
Can you do that?

04:37.510 --> 04:39.945
(Bonnie)
Lily.
What?

04:39.947 --> 04:43.915
Get off your ass and grab
your uncle's Epsom salts.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.885
I got to go help out
your mama, little one.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.370
(Bonnie)
Lily!

05:20.853 --> 05:23.255
You wanna hand me the salt?

05:38.304 --> 05:39.371
Sorry.

06:20.747 --> 06:24.049
Hogan says the fish
don't die from pollution,

06:24.317 --> 06:30.555
because when the algae blooms,
it sucks up all the oxygen.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.491
and then the fish suffocate.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.695
That's boring.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.700
I don't think so.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.944
You're such a baby.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.813
I'm two months
older than you.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.987
[train whistle]

07:03.556 --> 07:05.056
The train's coming.

07:13.032 --> 07:14.399
Come on.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.337
What are you doing?

07:20.740 --> 07:23.074
Is baby scared?

07:23.342 --> 07:24.843
Do you want mommy
to sing you your song?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.878
Cut it out.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.581
♪ Hush little baby,
don't say-- ♪

07:29.583 --> 07:30.715
Stop it!

07:30.717 --> 07:33.819
Come here.
No.

07:36.022 --> 07:41.993

buy you a mockingbird ♪
Cut it out.

07:41.995 --> 07:46.932

08:28.908 --> 08:31.076
(Margaret)
Lily, is that you?

08:31.078 --> 08:32.577
Yeah.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.014
Oh, hey, Ali,
how are you?
Good.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.717
It's Alison, Mom.
We're not, like,
five years old anymore.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.820
I didn't realize you guys
were so grown up now.
She's staying for dinner too.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.723
Oh, actually, I was gonna
go cook my dad dinner.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.791
Oh, how is your dad?
Oh, he's good.

08:46.793 --> 08:50.128
He found some copper wire--
Have you seen my black pumps?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.997
Are they up your ass?

08:51.999 --> 08:55.600
No, Lily, I don't believe
they are up my ass.

08:55.602 --> 08:58.570
You're such a spazz.
You interrupted Alison.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.971
I'm sorry, Ali.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.540
That's fine.
It's Alison, Mom.

09:01.542 --> 09:05.610
Alison. Your dad
found some wires?

09:05.612 --> 09:10.215
I was just trying
to say he's good.
Same as always.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.752
That's good.
Well, tell him I say hi.
Yeah.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.620
Was that so hard?

09:15.622 --> 09:17.522
Since when did you
become Miss Manners?

09:17.524 --> 09:19.524
For once someone's gotta
be civilized in this house.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.593
Why don't you
help me find my shoes?

10:11.043 --> 10:14.713
So I'm going to go meet
some friends at the bar.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.249
And don't forget, we have
your appointment tomorrow.
Fuck.

10:18.517 --> 10:21.219
And we can't cancel
because I lose money

10:21.221 --> 10:24.222
every time we don't
cancel 24 hours in advance.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.257
It's such a waste
of time, Mom.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.526
Don't say that.

10:49.582 --> 10:53.118
You need to talk
to someone, kiddo.
You need to.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.253
And you're surely
not talking to me.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.722
I talk to you every day.

11:01.994 --> 11:05.930
I just want
to understand
why you did it.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.900
Did what, Mother?
You know what.

11:08.902 --> 11:13.304
I'm sorry, Mother,
but I surely don't.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.206
Why did you
cut your leg?

11:24.116 --> 11:25.884
I was shaving.

11:29.588 --> 11:32.090
I guess I'm just
not that good at it yet.

11:38.597 --> 11:41.066
Okay, your appointment
is tomorrow at 10.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.364
I got you somethin'.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.734
Yeah?

12:17.837 --> 12:19.204
It's in your room.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.276
Thanks.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.434
Hey!
Does this look okay?
I have to get ready.

12:49.702 --> 12:52.871
Can you give me
some space to fucking
pee by myself, please?

12:52.873 --> 12:55.039
You know, stop saying
the word "fuck" so much.
You sound--

12:55.041 --> 12:57.142
Well, then will you
give me some privacy, Mom?

12:57.144 --> 12:59.144
I'm just asking,
does this look cute?

12:59.146 --> 13:02.247
I don't know.
I don't know.
Does this dress
look cute?

13:02.249 --> 13:03.348
You look old!

13:25.137 --> 13:27.138
You should
take down your hair.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.500
[giggling]

15:27.092 --> 15:28.493
(Sally)
You seem bored.

15:33.032 --> 15:36.034
I don't understand
why I'm being punished.

15:36.036 --> 15:39.570
What makes you think
you're being punished?

15:39.838 --> 15:42.273
I'm here, aren't I?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.943
Well, what would
you rather be doing

15:44.945 --> 15:49.447
instead of sitting
here with me?

15:49.449 --> 15:53.584
I don't know.
Shooting myself
in the face?

15:53.586 --> 15:57.155
Dousing myself
with gasoline
and lighting a match.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.191
It's funny how you often
mention hurting yourself.

16:01.860 --> 16:03.962
Thanks. I thought
I was funny, too.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.596
No, I guess I meant ironic.

16:08.934 --> 16:12.937
But with your father and all,
it's interesting.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.206
Your mom's interesting too.

16:15.208 --> 16:19.010
I'm curious about
the structure she provides.

16:19.012 --> 16:22.080
Have you seen any drug use?

16:22.082 --> 16:23.548
Does she have a boyfriend?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.490
I'm trying to help, Lily.

16:38.564 --> 16:41.499
Why do you think
you cut your legs?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.067
Why don't you
just cut it off?

16:43.069 --> 16:45.470
Cut what out?
Cut it off.

16:45.472 --> 16:50.274
Off?
Yeah, the hair
on your face.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.343
Are you talking
about my mole?

16:52.345 --> 16:56.014
That fucking gross
thing on your chin.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.419
We're here to talk
about you, Lily.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.589
How am I supposed
to talk when I feel
like I'm gonna barf?

17:19.671 --> 17:24.208
How'd it go?
Yeah, it was great.
I think it's really
starting to help.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.453
Do ever feel like
you're going to die?

17:40.092 --> 17:41.959
Like in a car crash?

17:43.595 --> 17:45.530
Yeah.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.330
Like...

17:49.668 --> 17:51.169
I don't know.

17:55.107 --> 17:58.709
Like the seaweed Hogan
was talking about.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.311
Algae.

18:04.716 --> 18:07.618
I feel like something's
stealing all my air.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.290
That's messed up.

18:15.694 --> 18:19.630
Hey! Cut the shit!
It ain't yours.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.266
So, it ain't yours
neither, and I hope it
bites your face off.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.702
I hope he bites
your tits off.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.505
Stupid fucker!

18:27.507 --> 18:29.540
You touch that dog again
and I'll burn down

18:29.542 --> 18:31.542
your fucking
welfare ass trailer.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.582
They took the baby
for the day.

18:37.584 --> 18:41.119
They took Mark
for the day.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.088
Probably going to parade him
around the neighborhood.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.190
Our son, the war hero.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.494
He is a war hero.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.429
Great.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.431
Give me his medal
in one hand
and shit in the other.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.800
See what I got.
Fuck.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.437
That whole table there
is 40 percent off
for just today.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.439
Thanks.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.307
Till death
do you part, right?

19:05.477 --> 19:10.715
Mark died the day
some sand nigger buried
an IED in a garbage can.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.651
What they sent home...

19:13.653 --> 19:16.053
I don't know
what that is,
but it's not my husband.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.734
Did you get
lipstick all over me?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.802
(Margaret)
Look, it's the Bobbsey Twins.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.272
(Bonnie)
Aw, they're like
a little cartoon duo.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.340
Lily and Ali
and the case
of the haunted mansion.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.609
She doesn't want
to be called Ali anymore.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.744
What does
she wanna be called?

19:39.746 --> 19:41.179
Alison.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.381
Oh, excuse me.

of the haunted mansion.

Come sit next
to your old mom.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.821
I've got
a mystery for you.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.857
Who's shit-faced
at two o'clock
in the afternoon?

19:53.091 --> 19:55.860
Guilty as charged, Scooby Doo.
That's right. Yeah!

19:59.231 --> 20:02.333
You look cute.
Maybe you should do something
with this hair, though.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.468
Like put a deep conditioner
on it or something.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.572
Wow. You know what?
You should do something
with your face, okay?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.507
That's not nice.
Can we dress up?

20:09.509 --> 20:11.576
No, I have to
sell this stuff.
Why?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.644
You can use
the things over there.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.580
No, I wanna
use this stuff.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.315
Don't use
the feather thing.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.484
Why? It's the best one.

20:20.486 --> 20:23.487
Can I wear
the skirt at least?
(Margaret)
Yeah.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.623
(Bonnie)
At least that one
picked something normal.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.426
Look, I want to look
like a fuzzy alien.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.529

At your service,
my fearless queen.

21:18.176 --> 21:20.411
Lily! Lily!

21:20.413 --> 21:23.414
My fearless queen,
don't you dare!

21:25.417 --> 21:27.318
I'm going to push you
in the water.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.953
Yes! Yes!

21:28.955 --> 21:33.924
No! No! No!
I'm melting.

21:34.192 --> 21:36.927
Oh no! Don't die.

21:37.195 --> 21:38.562
It's too late.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.268
Here. Don't you
ever forget me.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.875
Then, I'll put one on.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.689
What's that sound?

22:04.691 --> 22:05.623
I don't know.

22:08.293 --> 22:09.860
Let's investigate.

23:07.285 --> 23:10.721
My queen,
you are alive!
Shh!

23:15.627 --> 23:16.627
You look stupid.

23:33.378 --> 23:34.678
You guys want some beers?

23:38.316 --> 23:39.583
Sure.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.452
Climb over then.

23:43.321 --> 23:44.054
Lily.

24:22.727 --> 24:25.062
(Jesse)
What, are you, like
a raver or something?

24:27.132 --> 24:28.566
What's that?

24:31.770 --> 24:35.773
Somebody who
dresses all crazy.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.375
No, it was just
this stupid thing.

24:41.446 --> 24:44.048
I like your boots.
Yeah?

24:46.651 --> 24:50.821
Yeah, I think
they're cool.
Thanks.

25:06.137 --> 25:09.974
You know, you can't
find empty pools
like this in L.A. no more.

25:09.976 --> 25:13.544
We heard about this spot
and drove all the way out.

25:13.546 --> 25:17.481
But your town
smells like shit.

25:17.483 --> 25:22.553
It's the salt influx
from the sewage
and irrigation runoff.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.723
Are you a scientist?

25:28.093 --> 25:29.059
No.

25:37.502 --> 25:42.506
See all this
white stuff?
The sand?

25:42.508 --> 25:47.211
It's not really sand.
It's dead fish
and bird bones.

25:49.581 --> 25:51.181
Cool.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.983
Yeah.

25:56.187 --> 25:57.955
So, you have
a boyfriend?

fucking go!

26:25.216 --> 26:26.917
Thanks.

26:30.889 --> 26:31.989
Sorry.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.171
If you're ever in L.A.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.100
Sorry.

27:22.273 --> 27:25.009
Bye, Lily.

27:25.011 --> 27:25.909
Bye.

27:33.618 --> 27:34.551
Woo!

27:55.974 --> 27:59.209
Where'd you go?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.679
Didn't think
you'd notice I'd left.

28:01.681 --> 28:05.849
What's up your ass?

28:05.851 --> 28:06.817
Nothing.

28:11.222 --> 28:14.124
I kissed that boy.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.026
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.998
I bet he's kissed
lots of other girls.

28:25.003 --> 28:26.236
Maybe.

28:31.242 --> 28:34.344
We're gonna
hang out in L.A.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.846
How are you
getting there?

28:35.848 --> 28:37.147
I don't know.

28:45.657 --> 28:49.259
You can come along
if you want.

28:51.763 --> 28:53.697
Maybe.

29:14.953 --> 29:16.653
Hey, Tiger Lily.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.330
I know you're awake.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.369
Why do you always
have to touch me?

29:32.371 --> 29:34.104
Because I didn't
get to hold you

29:34.106 --> 29:38.842
for that whole
first month you were born.

29:38.844 --> 29:44.948
You were stuck
in the incubator.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.151
Your dad said that
you looked like

29:47.153 --> 29:51.388
a little chicken who came
out of the oven too early.

29:59.697 --> 30:00.697
Mom.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.835
Please, Mom.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.277
Lily, what are
you doing here?

30:47.279 --> 30:50.447
I figured it out.
We're gonna take
Hogan's truck to L.A.

30:50.449 --> 30:55.052
No way.
He's never gonna notice.
It just, like,
sits here all the time.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.855
Shh.
(Hogan)
Hey, Lily.

30:57.857 --> 31:00.924
You here
to unload some hay?

31:00.926 --> 31:03.093
No.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.395
Well, I hear work's
good for the soul.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.164
My soul's beyond repair.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.766
Think about it.

31:13.104 --> 31:15.272
I see that charm school
is really paying off.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.141
She don't mean it.

31:18.143 --> 31:22.012
She just doesn't
like living here.

31:22.014 --> 31:25.983
Well, one day
she'll realize
it's just geography.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.417
Where's the furthest
you've ever been?

31:31.089 --> 31:33.891
Bora Bora.
No way.

31:33.893 --> 31:37.094
I found work
on a freighter.

31:37.096 --> 31:40.898
We docked there
and I decided to stay.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.066
Was it amazing?

31:43.068 --> 31:46.536
I got a job at a resort
where this mangy dog

31:46.538 --> 31:50.974
and her pup
would hang around
begging for food.

31:50.976 --> 31:52.910
The guest complained,
so the manager sent me

31:52.912 --> 31:56.580
and this other guy,
just a local,
out to get 'em.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.883
The mother,
she trusted humans,
so she was easy.

31:59.885 --> 32:04.888
But her pup, she was
a slippery little sucker.

32:04.890 --> 32:08.025
We couldn't get her
no matter how hard we tried.

32:08.027 --> 32:12.562
We were supposed
to take her out
to the bigger island,

32:12.564 --> 32:16.166
about a 20-minute boat ride.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.902
My co-worker wanted
to get home for dinner, though.

32:18.904 --> 32:23.173
His wife was making
a Poisson Cru.

32:23.175 --> 32:26.109
So he threw
the dog off the boat
about halfway there.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.145
Oh, my God!

32:28.147 --> 32:30.280
That night
the whole island

32:30.282 --> 32:32.349
could hear
that pup howling

32:32.351 --> 32:35.953
and crying
for its mother.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.988
I traveled halfway
across the world

32:37.990 --> 32:40.390
to find out
that people are

32:40.392 --> 32:44.461
dumb and cruel everywhere.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.229
I could've just stayed home.

33:10.555 --> 33:14.157
I went
to Aunt Bonnie's.

33:14.159 --> 33:19.162
You weren't there.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.031
Did you change your mind?

33:28.406 --> 33:29.506
I can't, Lily.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.542
I can't do that
to Hogan.

33:43.254 --> 33:44.521
Fine.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.230
What's so great
about L.A. anyway?

33:58.436 --> 34:00.103
It's not here.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.645
Where are you going?

34:08.647 --> 34:10.180
I don't know.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.215
Can I come?

34:12.217 --> 34:13.316
No.

35:08.706 --> 35:11.541
You're ugly.
So?

35:11.543 --> 35:15.145
So don't go walking around
here acting like you
better than everybody else.

35:15.147 --> 35:19.116
I don't.
You told my brother
you was going
to burn down my house?

35:19.118 --> 35:21.751
No.
Liar.

35:22.019 --> 35:24.187
I'm gonna ask your ass again.

35:24.189 --> 35:27.591
Did you tell my brother
you was gonna
burn down my house?

35:29.627 --> 35:32.696
Don't look at that cunt.
Look at me! Look at me.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.664
No, I didn't say that.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.299
[spits]

35:36.301 --> 35:36.766
[laughs]

35:38.136 --> 35:39.769
Next time I see you

35:39.771 --> 35:42.672
I'm gonna stab you in
your little frizzled head.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.323
Thanks a lot.

36:02.059 --> 36:03.493
What was I
supposed to do?

36:08.199 --> 36:11.334
I'm leaving tonight.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.537
How?

36:13.539 --> 36:17.240
I'll wait by the bar
and get some trucker
or methhead to drive me.

36:17.242 --> 36:20.844
Are you stupid?
That'll get you dead
in a ditch somewhere.

36:21.112 --> 36:24.247
Yeah, well,if I stay here,
Shawna's just gonna
kill me anyway,

36:24.249 --> 36:26.216
so, what's
the fucking difference?

38:36.414 --> 38:37.681
[knocking]

38:44.555 --> 38:46.723
I knew you'd
come through.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.694
You're my best friend, stupid.

38:55.866 --> 38:58.601
Fuck you!

38:58.603 --> 38:59.769
Woo!

39:11.982 --> 39:12.949
[bumps]

39:14.418 --> 39:16.886
What the fuck?
It's fine.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.722
Did you just fall asleep?

39:18.724 --> 39:23.526
It's three
in the morning.
You're such a baby.

39:23.528 --> 39:24.894
Fine, Lily,
why don't you drive?

39:24.896 --> 39:27.931
Oh wait,
nobody taught you how.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.433
You don't have
to be a bitch about it.

39:30.435 --> 39:33.703
I'm sorry.
Let's just pull over
and sleep for a while.

39:37.341 --> 39:39.909
[giggling]

39:39.911 --> 39:41.678
Do you remember
when we thought

39:41.680 --> 39:44.748
that your mom
was gonna marry my dad

39:44.750 --> 39:48.518
and we were gonna
be sisters for real?

39:48.520 --> 39:50.453
Yeah. Then we realized
that your dad's, like,

39:50.455 --> 39:52.989
100 years old
and super ugly.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.695
You're just upset
because we saw
Darryl Baker's father

39:58.697 --> 40:02.665
coming out of your
mom's room in his underwear.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.534
Oh, you cried.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.035
You cried so hard
thinking that Darryl

40:06.037 --> 40:08.338
was gonna be
your brother instead.

40:20.084 --> 40:24.053
Yeah, my mom was
gonna marry your dad.

40:24.321 --> 40:27.757
And we were gonna
move to the beach.

40:27.759 --> 40:31.728
A real beach
with a real ocean.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.696
And every morning
we would wake up

40:33.698 --> 40:37.467
and roll out of bed
and dive straight
into the water.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.907
Yeah.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.168
Hey.
Hey.

41:45.436 --> 41:47.570
So Jesse said
we're not far out.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.506
Woo-hoo.

41:49.508 --> 41:53.510
He gave me an address
for where we got to meet them.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.512
Hey, where'd you
get those chips?

41:55.514 --> 41:57.013
I bought them.

41:57.015 --> 42:01.117
But I thought you
didn't have any money.

42:01.119 --> 42:04.187
Fine. Whatever.
I stole them. Sue me.

42:04.455 --> 42:07.790
Lily.
What?

42:07.792 --> 42:10.159
Who cares, huh?

42:10.427 --> 42:11.995
Something for you anyway.

42:16.967 --> 42:18.601
Hypocrite.

42:24.808 --> 42:29.979
Hey, I'm just kidding.
Where are you going?
To pay for these.

42:29.981 --> 42:33.550
No, if you pay for them,
they're gonna know I took them.

42:33.552 --> 42:36.452
For the first time
in your life, could
you just not be a baby?

42:41.492 --> 42:44.761
No fucking way. No.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.129
God damn it.

43:04.782 --> 43:08.251
Your friend
send you back for more?
No, I was just
putting it back.

43:08.253 --> 43:10.787
Do I look
that fucking stupid?
No! I'm sorry, okay?

43:10.789 --> 43:12.722
We're gonna
wait right here
for the police.

43:12.724 --> 43:14.691
No, please let me go.
You and your
little girlfriend

43:14.693 --> 43:16.593
come in here
thinking the sun
shines out your asses.

43:16.595 --> 43:18.227
Well, I got a rude
awakening for you,
all right?

43:18.229 --> 43:19.596
This is
a citizen's arrest.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.264
Stand back!
Ow!

43:21.532 --> 43:22.532
Run!
Lily!

43:25.069 --> 43:27.036
What the hell
are you doing?

43:27.038 --> 43:27.704
Don't!

43:31.909 --> 43:34.243
Fucking, drive!
Come back here!

43:34.511 --> 43:36.879
Go, go, go!
Come on!

43:36.881 --> 43:38.881
Shit.

43:38.883 --> 43:40.683
Fucking bitches!

43:45.723 --> 43:46.856
[laughing]

43:46.858 --> 43:49.292
That's not funny!

43:49.294 --> 43:51.928
"This is
a citizen's arrest."

43:54.798 --> 43:57.533
It's a little funny.

44:56.126 --> 44:58.628
Hey, there they are!
Look! Pull over.

45:00.164 --> 45:02.365
Pull over. Come on.
I'm going. I'm going.

45:04.735 --> 45:07.103
Pull over.
I'm going.

45:08.839 --> 45:10.239
Where am I
supposed to park?

45:10.241 --> 45:13.009
Lily, where am I
supposed to park?

45:13.011 --> 45:14.210
Lily!

45:14.212 --> 45:16.112
[honking]

45:18.916 --> 45:20.083
Hey.

45:22.619 --> 45:25.154
Where's Jesse?

45:26.757 --> 45:28.991
It's Lily.
From the pool.

45:31.261 --> 45:33.396
He said he don't
want to see you.

45:33.398 --> 45:37.166
What?
He said to go back
to wherever the hell
you came from.

45:37.168 --> 45:40.136
Why? What did I do?

45:43.707 --> 45:46.876
Yo, we're just playin'.
He's there with the
homeless dude gettin' booze.

45:46.878 --> 45:50.713
Yeah, I'll keep you
safe till he gets back,
what do you think?

45:50.715 --> 45:53.950
Yeah?
No.

45:53.952 --> 45:56.219
Where's your
ugly friend?
She's not ugly.

45:56.221 --> 45:57.353
She ain't pretty.

45:59.256 --> 46:00.389
Lily?

46:03.894 --> 46:04.660
Hi.

46:05.662 --> 46:07.063
Hi.

46:07.065 --> 46:10.266
Dickhead,
you trying to get busted?

46:10.268 --> 46:12.902
Let's not stand in the middle
of the fucking street with beer.

46:12.904 --> 46:16.072
Huh? Use your fucking head.

46:16.074 --> 46:17.106
What do you think?

46:19.943 --> 46:21.077
Jesus.

46:30.320 --> 46:31.454
What's going on?

46:31.722 --> 46:32.889
Just drive.

46:34.291 --> 46:37.426
Let's go.
Take a left.

47:07.724 --> 47:10.259
Yo, so there are, like,
a bunch of wildcats up here

47:10.261 --> 47:12.195
like fucking cougars
and shit like that.

47:12.197 --> 47:14.263
They fucking are
eating people,
like, all the time.

47:14.265 --> 47:16.799
No way.
I don't believe you.
That's bullshit.

47:16.801 --> 47:19.435
I swear. I swear. David.

47:19.437 --> 47:22.004
What?

47:22.006 --> 47:24.006
No, man.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.975
They all died
in the wildfires.
You know that.

47:25.977 --> 47:27.343
You're fucking
full of shit.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.145
He's just trying
to spit game--

47:29.147 --> 47:34.016
That's really awful.
Like, a wildfire? Like--

47:34.018 --> 47:36.419
Yeah, you know,
it's crazy.

47:36.421 --> 47:41.457
Me and David,
after the last fire,
we snuck up here.

47:41.459 --> 47:43.492
But you gotta
be really careful
because there's

47:43.494 --> 47:45.494
firemen and police
and you gotta sneak in.

47:45.762 --> 47:47.496
And then when
you get up here,

47:47.764 --> 47:54.103
there's nothing
but charred rabbits
and fucking coyotes.

47:54.105 --> 47:56.239
Then there was
the fucking deer tree.

47:56.241 --> 47:58.040
There was
this tree somewhere.

47:58.042 --> 48:00.076
I don't remember
where we were,

48:00.078 --> 48:02.979
but there's
this deer just strung up--
It was in the tree?

48:02.981 --> 48:05.281
I don't know, he must've had
his antlers stuck in a branch

48:05.283 --> 48:07.483
when he was trying
to outrun the flames
or something.

48:07.485 --> 48:11.454
But when we found him
there was nothing left.

48:11.456 --> 48:14.123
He was, like, just
charred meat and skeleton--

48:14.125 --> 48:17.526
Okay, we get the picture.
Okay, we get it. It was awful.

48:17.794 --> 48:20.897
No, it's awesome.

48:20.899 --> 48:24.200
That's reality.
Living's hard.

48:24.202 --> 48:26.969
Especially around here.

48:26.971 --> 48:29.972
Living's hard
everywhere.

48:29.974 --> 48:34.210
Oh, wise one, do you have
any other pearls of wisdom
for us today?

48:34.212 --> 48:39.282
Screw you.
No thanks.
I like girls.

48:39.284 --> 48:41.017
Okay. Okay.

48:42.185 --> 48:44.086
I'm serious.
Okay.

48:44.088 --> 48:48.557
Be nice
to Lily's friend.
Okay.
Let's be friends.

48:48.825 --> 48:51.327
Shut the fuck up
and do what you're told.

48:51.329 --> 48:52.929
Wait. Where are you going?

48:52.931 --> 48:55.197
To piss.
You want to hold my dick?

49:03.373 --> 49:04.941
I like him.

49:06.843 --> 49:08.544
I know you do.

49:33.170 --> 49:35.471
Are you drunk?
I don't know.

49:35.473 --> 49:37.340
I'm, like, totally
fucked up right now.

49:37.342 --> 49:39.442
Be careful.
Of what?

49:39.444 --> 49:41.143
[glass shattering]

49:41.145 --> 49:43.646
I fucking
love it here.

49:43.914 --> 49:45.548
My bad.
Excuse me.

49:45.550 --> 49:47.950
Hey, watch where
the fuck you're going.
Lily.

49:47.952 --> 49:50.286
Wow, there's
no reason
to be a bitch.

49:50.288 --> 49:52.188
Fuck you.
Lily.

49:52.190 --> 49:54.357
Okay, tough guy,
have a nice life.

49:55.892 --> 49:59.228
What's up?
Hi. What happened?

49:59.230 --> 50:01.197
(Alison)
Nothing.
Nothing happened.

50:01.199 --> 50:03.165
This guy called me a bitch.

50:03.167 --> 50:05.434
(David)
Did you call
my friend a bitch?

50:05.436 --> 50:08.004
Listen, I don't got
a problem with you.

50:08.006 --> 50:10.006
Well, maybe I got
a problem with you.

50:10.008 --> 50:14.410
If I offended anyone,
it was my mistake.
And I'm sorry.

50:14.412 --> 50:17.079
Okay, but you don't
need to apologize to us.

50:17.081 --> 50:21.584
You need
to apologize
to the girls.

50:21.586 --> 50:22.685
I'm sorry.

50:24.087 --> 50:25.388
Oh shit!

50:27.591 --> 50:29.258
Gimme this bag,
mother fucker.

50:31.928 --> 50:32.495
Run!

50:39.169 --> 50:40.169
You okay?

50:43.340 --> 50:44.006
Run!

50:46.510 --> 50:47.276
Yo.

50:49.413 --> 50:51.313
Come on. Come on.

50:51.315 --> 50:53.416
Hurry up.

50:53.418 --> 50:55.184
Jesus.

51:01.958 --> 51:03.492
What is this place?

51:05.962 --> 51:08.497
This is
where we live.
This is cool.

51:08.499 --> 51:11.400
Yeah, it's sick.
David even tapped
into the power.

51:35.525 --> 51:38.260
You guys don't
get in trouble
for staying here?

51:38.262 --> 51:40.563
No, every once in a while
you gotta come through

51:40.565 --> 51:43.499
and kick some fucking
homeless people out, but...

51:43.501 --> 51:48.170
Yeah, they poop
in the hallways.
That's gross.

51:48.172 --> 51:53.676
Okay, so we got
a laptop, a calculator,
and a bunch of books.

51:53.678 --> 51:56.745
Probably get, like,
a grand on Craigslist
for the computer?

51:57.013 --> 51:58.547
Yeah, but that guy
probably needs it

51:58.549 --> 52:01.350
for school
or something, right?

52:01.352 --> 52:03.385
Golly gee willakers,
she's right.

52:03.387 --> 52:05.688
We should probably
turn it into
the lost and found.

52:05.690 --> 52:07.656
Actually, the next time
we wanna hear from

52:07.658 --> 52:13.329
the itty bitty
titty committee,
we'll be sure to ask.

52:13.331 --> 52:15.431
(Louis)
Itty bitty
titty committee.

52:22.439 --> 52:24.440
Are you gonna
make out with Louis?

52:24.442 --> 52:27.576
What? No.

52:27.578 --> 52:29.178
I think you should
hook up with him.

52:30.447 --> 52:32.548
Why?

52:32.550 --> 52:34.750
I don't wanna
be the only one.

52:37.621 --> 52:39.588
Then why
don't you either?

52:43.260 --> 52:44.827
Can you just
try to have fun?

52:47.197 --> 52:50.232
For once?

52:50.234 --> 52:51.500
For me?

53:23.800 --> 53:26.402
I think you're pretty.

53:26.404 --> 53:27.503
Really?

53:30.273 --> 53:31.607
Kinda.

53:42.118 --> 53:44.587
I have to go
to the bathroom.

53:44.589 --> 53:47.156
I have to go
to the bathroom.

54:17.420 --> 54:20.456
Hey, I hope you
didn't drop a deuce.

54:20.458 --> 54:21.924
The plumbing
don't work.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.481
Where are we going?

55:19.483 --> 55:21.216
I wanna
show you something.

55:42.906 --> 55:45.474
Hey, where did you go?

55:45.476 --> 55:48.377
Jesse?

55:48.379 --> 55:49.645
Home sweet home.

56:04.694 --> 56:06.362
This is your house?

56:07.664 --> 56:08.897
It used to be.

56:10.967 --> 56:14.737
Where's your family?

56:14.739 --> 56:17.005
Moved to Arizona
about six months ago.

56:21.411 --> 56:24.346
Are you rich?

56:24.348 --> 56:28.517
If we were rich,
we would still
live here.

56:28.519 --> 56:32.321
So then
out of the blue
my dad says

56:32.323 --> 56:34.656
we're moving
to Scottsdale.

56:34.658 --> 56:36.592
And we're staying
with my grandparents.

56:36.594 --> 56:39.528
And they told me
that I wasn't
allowed to take King.

56:41.331 --> 56:43.065
Who's King?

56:43.333 --> 56:46.402
King was...

56:46.404 --> 56:48.837
this big dumb...

56:48.839 --> 56:51.039
fat, and he's
completely retarded,

56:51.307 --> 56:53.075
he was this big,
fat, ginger cat

56:53.343 --> 56:56.478
that I had, you know,
since I was, like,
five years old.

56:58.314 --> 57:01.583
He was cool.

57:01.585 --> 57:06.021
But he got kinda sick,
so he needed, like,
a lot of medication and stuff.

57:06.023 --> 57:11.059
So one day
my dad drove him
to the animal shelter

57:11.061 --> 57:14.430
while my mom
and my sister
packed up the house.

57:16.433 --> 57:21.537
And then it was
just like that.

57:21.539 --> 57:24.740
We were,
we were up and gone.

57:27.410 --> 57:30.546
I bet he
ended up going home
with a really great family.

57:33.016 --> 57:35.918
Or he's dead,
put to sleep.

57:39.422 --> 57:44.092
You know, I stayed,
like, in Scottsdale
for about a month.

57:44.094 --> 57:46.862
Close to a month,
and I couldn't take it.

57:46.864 --> 57:50.098
So I snuck out one night
and hopped on a bus

57:50.366 --> 57:52.134
and I came back here.

57:52.402 --> 57:55.070
Aren't they,
like, freaking out
looking for you?

57:56.606 --> 57:58.774
Yeah, probably.

58:05.381 --> 58:09.885
Fuck it, you know?

58:09.887 --> 58:15.724
Now they got
one less mouth to feed.

58:15.726 --> 58:18.894
I'm-can you
do me a favor
and please don't

58:18.896 --> 58:22.164
tell the other guys
about this place, okay?
Why?

58:22.432 --> 58:24.933
You should all live here
instead of that nasty motel.

58:24.935 --> 58:26.935
No, they'd just
come and trash it.

58:29.806 --> 58:33.175
I mean this is
still my home.

58:33.177 --> 58:34.510
Okay.

58:59.969 --> 59:01.904
[phone ringing]

59:01.906 --> 59:03.739
Here. Get it.

59:10.446 --> 59:11.780
Hello?

59:11.782 --> 59:13.949
Is that them?

59:13.951 --> 59:15.584
Hello?

59:30.700 --> 59:31.800
What'd they say?

59:31.802 --> 59:34.770
Nobody there.

59:34.772 --> 59:36.605
They hung up.

59:42.645 --> 59:44.846
[phone ringing]

59:53.957 --> 59:54.990
Hello?

59:59.228 --> 1:00:01.863
I'm sorry, Hogan.

1:00:05.768 --> 1:00:07.703
Look, I swear I'm gonna
bring your truck back

1:00:07.705 --> 1:00:09.771
without a scratch
on it, I promise.

1:00:09.773 --> 1:00:12.240
Oh hell, I don't care
about that truck.

1:00:12.242 --> 1:00:16.178
I care a little
about that truck.

1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:20.649
I care a whole lot more
about you getting home
without a scratch.

1:00:20.651 --> 1:00:21.883
How's Lily?

1:00:21.885 --> 1:00:24.252
She's okay.

1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:26.722
We're both okay.

1:00:26.724 --> 1:00:31.693
I don't know.
I don't know
anything anymore.

1:00:31.695 --> 1:00:33.161
Well, they say
if you're not confused

1:00:33.163 --> 1:00:35.230
that means
you're not thinking enough.

1:00:35.232 --> 1:00:37.265
I'm sorry, Hogan.

1:00:37.267 --> 1:00:39.034
Now, now, hey, hey, hey.

1:00:41.537 --> 1:00:44.272
So what kind of trail
of murder and mayhem
have you two left?

1:00:46.042 --> 1:00:47.776
Not too bad.

1:00:47.778 --> 1:00:50.646
Really?
No harm, no foul, right?

1:00:50.648 --> 1:00:53.682
You just come home.

1:00:53.684 --> 1:00:57.219
You got people here
worried about you.

1:00:57.221 --> 1:00:59.187
Okay.

1:00:59.189 --> 1:01:00.656
It's time to come home.

1:01:03.693 --> 1:01:04.793
Bye, Hogan.

1:01:32.055 --> 1:01:33.655
Hey, come on.

1:01:52.108 --> 1:01:53.842
You sure you
wanna do this?

1:01:58.981 --> 1:02:00.282
'Cause we don't have to.

1:02:03.152 --> 1:02:05.020
I know. I want to.

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:01.409
What is that?

1:03:01.677 --> 1:03:02.778
It's nothing.

1:03:04.881 --> 1:03:08.016
Are they scars?
Uh-huh.

1:03:09.819 --> 1:03:11.953
What happened?

1:03:11.955 --> 1:03:13.455
I don't know.
I got bored.

1:03:21.697 --> 1:03:22.697
Did it hurt?

1:03:24.700 --> 1:03:25.867
No.

1:03:38.981 --> 1:03:39.981
I'm sorry.

1:03:46.055 --> 1:03:52.160
Maybe we should
just wait anyway,
you know?

1:03:52.162 --> 1:03:54.229
Whatever.

1:04:58.394 --> 1:05:01.296
(Realtor)
--foreclosures now.
Oh, shit!

1:05:01.298 --> 1:05:04.332
They're ripping up
the carpet and faucets.

1:05:08.104 --> 1:05:09.571
I don't know.
That's disgusting.

1:05:09.573 --> 1:05:11.339
Seriously,
that's gross.
Really.

1:05:11.341 --> 1:05:13.909
I'm not sure how
I feel about...
(scream)

1:05:13.911 --> 1:05:17.879
and we'll probably
have to blast out these walls
to make room for the nursery.

1:05:17.881 --> 1:05:21.283
The kids could always
live in the backyard.
What do you think you're doing?

1:05:21.285 --> 1:05:23.184
Maybe make a shed
for them or something.

1:05:29.025 --> 1:05:30.091
Excuse me.

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:40.302
Yo, you gotta
check this out.

1:05:40.304 --> 1:05:43.238
Thick uncut cock
ready to unload.

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:45.607
What are you talking about?

1:05:45.609 --> 1:05:49.511
Young sexy couple
looking for a kinky girl.

1:05:49.513 --> 1:05:53.148
I really don't
wanna look at porn
with you guys.
It's not porn.

1:05:53.150 --> 1:05:56.985
It's this website where people
put these personal ads
and they meet up and fuck.

1:05:56.987 --> 1:06:02.123
Any ladies in need of some
big black dick this morning?
Yes, please.

1:06:02.125 --> 1:06:06.962
Who the fuck is Tina?
Everybody's looking for her.
It's crystal meth, idiot.

1:06:06.964 --> 1:06:10.065
All this shit is drugs,
like party favors,
snow, powder.

1:06:10.067 --> 1:06:12.200
We're gonna write one.
Why?

1:06:12.202 --> 1:06:15.203
We're gonna lure
some pervert back here
and rob him.

1:06:16.872 --> 1:06:19.074
How exactly do you
plan on doing that?

1:06:24.046 --> 1:06:25.547
No.
(Louis)
Come on.

1:06:25.549 --> 1:06:27.415
We'll be right
in the bathroom hiding.

1:06:27.417 --> 1:06:29.417
She says the
code word, fucking--
We jump out.

1:06:29.419 --> 1:06:31.119
Yeah, and then what happens
when she gets hurt?

1:06:31.121 --> 1:06:33.021
How? We're right there.

1:06:33.023 --> 1:06:35.123
Okay, then, what happens
when they call the police?

1:06:35.125 --> 1:06:37.225
Oh, you think he's gonna
call the fucking police?

1:06:37.227 --> 1:06:39.661
"Yes, Officer, I was
about to have sex
with this underage girl

1:06:39.663 --> 1:06:41.963
and then some hooligans
jumped out and robbed me."

1:06:41.965 --> 1:06:43.631
Fuck that.
Yeah, fuck that.

1:06:43.633 --> 1:06:46.134
Shut the fuck up, Louis.
Shut the fuck up, Louis.

1:06:51.073 --> 1:06:52.207
(David)
Come on.

1:06:52.209 --> 1:06:54.109
I don't know, man.

1:06:54.111 --> 1:06:56.044
See, everybody
always wants to be down

1:06:56.046 --> 1:06:58.346
and when shit gets real--
No, look,
I'm just sayin'--

1:06:58.348 --> 1:07:01.950
Yeah, you're just saying
you're a fucking pussy.

1:07:04.053 --> 1:07:05.353
What about you?

1:07:08.190 --> 1:07:09.924
What do you say?

1:07:17.233 --> 1:07:18.666
Okay.

1:07:18.668 --> 1:07:22.370
Thank you. Fuck.
Some nuts, finally.

1:07:42.491 --> 1:07:46.661
Young, white girl

1:07:46.663 --> 1:07:53.735
looking for my big daddy.

1:07:54.970 --> 1:07:57.572
That's gross.

1:07:57.574 --> 1:08:04.279
Must be white

1:08:04.281 --> 1:08:06.548
and very generous.

1:08:30.139 --> 1:08:32.307
Hi.

1:08:32.309 --> 1:08:34.576
Hi.

1:08:34.578 --> 1:08:36.478
Come find Alison
with me.

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:38.780
(Louis)
Shit. I keep
losing the connection.

1:08:38.782 --> 1:08:43.218
Please? Come on.

1:08:43.220 --> 1:08:46.187
Yeah, we're gonna
go look for Alison.

1:08:46.189 --> 1:08:48.056
Holy shit!
What?

1:08:50.426 --> 1:08:52.794
(Louis)
Look, dude, look at
all of these responses.

1:08:52.796 --> 1:08:54.162
Come on, come on.
Get up, get up.

1:08:56.632 --> 1:08:59.267
I'll be your daddy.
Sugar daddy here.

1:08:59.269 --> 1:09:02.470
What can Daddy for you?

1:09:02.472 --> 1:09:04.139
Oh!
Oh!

1:09:04.141 --> 1:09:06.641
Dude just sent
a picture of his dick.

1:09:06.643 --> 1:09:08.776
Oh my God,
I'm going to throw up.

1:09:09.078 --> 1:09:10.612
(David)
What about this guy?

1:09:14.250 --> 1:09:18.786
I don't know,
he looks nice.

1:09:18.788 --> 1:09:20.655
Yeah, no, he does.

1:09:20.657 --> 1:09:24.425
You guys are pathetic.
This guy's a piece of shit.

1:09:24.427 --> 1:09:27.695
He looks nice?
What the hell's
the matter with you people?
What?

1:09:27.697 --> 1:09:29.731
We're going to rob
a perv. Come see.

1:10:00.563 --> 1:10:01.863
Lily?

1:10:18.647 --> 1:10:22.517
This is so stupid.
She could be abducted.

1:10:22.519 --> 1:10:24.752
She'll be fine.

1:10:30.326 --> 1:10:32.126
This feels like
a surprise party.

1:10:35.297 --> 1:10:38.266
Where are we going?
My car is back there.

1:10:38.268 --> 1:10:40.735
I just gotta
grab my stuff.

1:10:40.737 --> 1:10:43.204
You live back here?

1:10:43.206 --> 1:10:44.872
Yeah, just for now.

1:10:46.775 --> 1:10:48.142
Are you a runaway?

1:10:49.311 --> 1:10:51.279
I guess.

1:10:51.281 --> 1:10:53.448
Well, does anyone
know where you are?

1:10:56.652 --> 1:10:58.486
You do.

1:11:01.790 --> 1:11:03.324
This is taking too long.

1:11:05.361 --> 1:11:08.596
Shut up.
(Man)
Sorry.

1:11:14.670 --> 1:11:15.937
Nice little
set up you got.

1:11:20.609 --> 1:11:21.676
I like it.

1:11:24.847 --> 1:11:26.948
Looks like the
bed's seen some use.

1:11:32.187 --> 1:11:34.389
Did you bring money?

1:11:34.391 --> 1:11:37.492
Maybe.

1:11:37.494 --> 1:11:39.727
How generous would you
like me to be?

1:11:47.803 --> 1:11:49.437
I like your eyes.

1:11:49.439 --> 1:11:51.506
Surprise!
Whoa.

1:11:51.508 --> 1:11:52.774
Very generous motherfucker.

1:11:52.776 --> 1:11:54.876
We were just talking.

1:11:54.878 --> 1:11:56.678
I don't give a fuck.
Give me your money,
you fucking pervert.

1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:01.649
Okay. Okay.
Let's all relax.
No.

1:12:01.651 --> 1:12:03.751
How about I leave
and we pretend
this never happened?

1:12:03.753 --> 1:12:06.354
Yeah, go and get
the fuck out of here!

1:12:06.356 --> 1:12:07.655
Get the fuck back!

1:12:07.657 --> 1:12:10.458
Whoa, hey!
Look, relax, man.

1:12:10.460 --> 1:12:11.959
We got his money.
Just let him go.

1:12:12.227 --> 1:12:13.728
I know you got a phone.
Give me your phone.

1:12:13.730 --> 1:12:15.463
No, it's a Blackberry.

1:12:15.465 --> 1:12:18.666
I don't give a fuck,
motherfucker.
Here.

1:12:18.668 --> 1:12:20.435
I'm gonna assume that
somewhere in that phone

1:12:20.437 --> 1:12:21.803
there's a number
that says "home"

1:12:21.805 --> 1:12:23.771
and at said home
there's a woman

1:12:23.773 --> 1:12:25.840
who would be
less than pleased
to find out her husband

1:12:25.842 --> 1:12:27.809
was trying to fuck
a 15-year-old girl.

1:12:27.811 --> 1:12:29.977
I'm sorry.
Shut the fuck up!

1:12:30.245 --> 1:12:33.014
So when I ask you for
the PIN number I assume
you're telling the truth.

1:12:33.282 --> 1:12:37.719
Otherwise, I'll have to call
your wife and ask her for it.

1:12:37.721 --> 1:12:40.521
Seven, four--
(David)
Speak!

1:12:40.523 --> 1:12:43.424
Seven, four, nine, four.

1:12:43.426 --> 1:12:47.028
Is that your final answer?
Yes. Yes.

1:12:47.296 --> 1:12:49.497
Michael Kenneth White.

1:12:49.499 --> 1:12:52.800
1460 El Dorado Street,
Glendale, California.

1:12:52.802 --> 1:12:53.601
Yes.

1:12:57.806 --> 1:13:01.008
Get the fuck
out of here.

1:13:01.276 --> 1:13:03.878
Go. Go.

1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:05.546
Holy shit!

1:13:07.716 --> 1:13:10.017
That was such...

1:13:10.019 --> 1:13:11.652
a fucking rush.

1:13:13.622 --> 1:13:15.623
(Louis)
Is that your final answer?

1:13:18.660 --> 1:13:20.294
What the hell?

1:13:23.699 --> 1:13:25.600
You never said
anything about a gun.

1:13:25.602 --> 1:13:27.935
I didn't realize
I had to clear it with you.

1:13:27.937 --> 1:13:30.071
Can I hold it?

1:13:30.073 --> 1:13:31.739
(Alison)
Lily, be careful .

1:13:31.741 --> 1:13:33.608
You're such a baby.

1:13:33.610 --> 1:13:35.643
Yeah, well, I know a lot
more about guns than you.

1:13:35.645 --> 1:13:37.578
I shoot with Hogan
all the time.

1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:40.982
(Louis)
What the fuck's a Hogan?

1:13:40.984 --> 1:13:42.784
It's Alison's Big Daddy.

1:13:44.453 --> 1:13:45.420
Screw you, Lily.

1:13:47.356 --> 1:13:51.426
Careful.
It's not a toy.

1:13:53.896 --> 1:13:56.731
Let's go get
some fucking shit.
(Louis)
Fuck yeah.

1:14:08.343 --> 1:14:09.911
What if he had
hurt that guy?

1:14:09.913 --> 1:14:11.446
He didn't.

1:14:11.448 --> 1:14:13.047
No, I know,
but what if he had?

1:14:13.049 --> 1:14:14.348
It's not a big deal.

1:14:15.717 --> 1:14:16.984
We have to go back.

1:14:16.986 --> 1:14:19.454
What? No. Not yet.

1:14:19.456 --> 1:14:20.655
Okay, when?

1:14:22.658 --> 1:14:27.028
I just want to spend
some more time with Jesse.

1:14:27.030 --> 1:14:30.031
We'll go back tonight, okay?
Promise?

1:14:30.033 --> 1:14:33.501
Sure.
No, you have
to promise me, Lily.
Okay. Don't spazz out.

1:14:33.503 --> 1:14:35.837
(David)
Oh, shit. The only time
they put the jump man

1:14:35.839 --> 1:14:39.974
on anything other than Jordan
was the P-Rod collaboration.
How do you know?

1:14:39.976 --> 1:14:41.876
Well, because I'm not
some stupid fucking spic

1:14:41.878 --> 1:14:44.011
who doesn't know jack shit
about sneakers like you.

1:14:44.013 --> 1:14:45.446
I got you something.

1:14:54.122 --> 1:14:57.492
What now?
We are gonna go
buy more sneakers.

1:14:57.494 --> 1:15:02.563
(Louis)
If we don't do our part,
the terrorists will have won.
Come on, Alison.

1:16:24.179 --> 1:16:27.615
Louis, I can physically
hear you developing diabetes.

1:16:31.186 --> 1:16:35.656
I'd rather have diabetes
than drink diet soda
and get rectal cancer.

1:16:35.658 --> 1:16:39.026
Alison's mom
died of cancer.

1:16:39.028 --> 1:16:41.262
Lily!
What? It's true.

1:16:41.264 --> 1:16:42.997
Yeah, but it's none
of their business.

1:16:42.999 --> 1:16:45.199
I don't go around
talking about your dad.

1:16:45.201 --> 1:16:48.769
What?
That he killed himself?
Wow.

1:16:48.771 --> 1:16:52.673
Everybody knows now.
I guess I should
totally freak out.

1:16:54.977 --> 1:16:56.644
How'd he do it?

1:17:01.783 --> 1:17:05.152
A gun.

1:17:05.154 --> 1:17:09.056
That's so fucking cool.

1:17:09.058 --> 1:17:13.894
Shit, if I was
gonna kill myself
I'd use a gun, too.

1:17:13.896 --> 1:17:16.631
Or jump off
a big ass bridge.

1:17:16.633 --> 1:17:19.300
Yeah, I hear when you
jump off a bridge

1:17:19.302 --> 1:17:23.537
you fall
and you die on impact
when you hit the water.

1:17:25.974 --> 1:17:30.077
The bridge
gotta be high, though.

1:17:30.079 --> 1:17:32.279
Thank you, Louis.

1:17:32.281 --> 1:17:33.948
That's very
enlightening.

1:17:33.950 --> 1:17:35.750
Of course it's gotta
be fucking high,

1:17:35.752 --> 1:17:40.087
otherwise you'd just
hit the water and drown.

1:17:40.089 --> 1:17:42.323
I hear drowning's
a really beautiful
way to die.

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:44.625
It's really peaceful.

1:17:44.627 --> 1:17:46.827
Who told you that?

1:17:46.829 --> 1:17:50.865
I don't know.
I read it.

1:17:50.867 --> 1:17:52.800
How the fuck
would they know?

1:17:52.802 --> 1:17:56.704
They obviously didn't drown
if they wrote it in a book.

1:17:56.706 --> 1:18:00.708
Well, maybe they, like,
maybe, like, almost drowned.

1:18:00.710 --> 1:18:02.677
No. No. No.
Yeah.

1:18:02.679 --> 1:18:05.913
Why? Maybe someone
came and saved them.

1:18:05.915 --> 1:18:07.715
No, but that ain't drowning.

1:18:09.117 --> 1:18:10.117
Like...

1:18:12.854 --> 1:18:18.359
what if almost drowning
was all peaceful and shit

1:18:18.627 --> 1:18:25.299
like those last few minutes
of actually drowning
is fucking horrible.

1:18:28.970 --> 1:18:32.339
I mean, how fucking
pissed would you be?

1:18:32.607 --> 1:18:34.709
You're fucking, like,
expecting rainbows

1:18:34.711 --> 1:18:37.111
and fucking
angels and shit...

1:18:41.717 --> 1:18:43.984
and it's just this
total fucking horror.

1:18:45.921 --> 1:18:46.987
Sweet. Okay.

1:18:48.924 --> 1:18:50.825
You're meetin'
your next guy
in 20 minutes.

1:18:50.827 --> 1:18:52.760
(Alison)
What do you mean?

1:18:52.762 --> 1:18:56.697
What do you mean
what do I mean?
Did I stutter?

1:18:56.699 --> 1:18:58.999
Well, you already
got a bunch of stuff today.

1:18:59.001 --> 1:19:01.235
Yeah, and now we're gonna
get a bunch more stuff.

1:19:01.237 --> 1:19:04.038
So you can either
shut the fuck up
or get the fuck out.

1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:07.174
'cause you've been
a stupid fucking cunt
since you got here.

1:19:07.176 --> 1:19:08.743
(Louis laughs)

1:19:12.347 --> 1:19:13.147
Good.

1:19:14.983 --> 1:19:16.417
Come on, Lily, let's go.

1:19:18.954 --> 1:19:20.921
Let's go. Come on.
We're gonna go.

1:19:38.874 --> 1:19:41.108
Good riddance, bitch.

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:52.787
Hey!
What are you doing?

1:19:52.789 --> 1:19:55.356
I'm going home, Lily.
Sorry.

1:19:55.358 --> 1:19:57.458
Why do you have
to ruin everything?

1:19:57.726 --> 1:20:01.095
I'm not ruining anything.
I just don't even
recognize you anymore.

1:20:01.097 --> 1:20:05.966
That's because for the first
time in my entire life,
I'm really happy.

1:20:05.968 --> 1:20:08.202
Good for you.

1:20:08.204 --> 1:20:09.770
Let's go.
Let's go home.

1:20:09.772 --> 1:20:11.472
I'm not fucking
leaving Jesse.

1:20:13.942 --> 1:20:16.944
He doesn't care
about you, Lily!

1:20:16.946 --> 1:20:19.313
You're just some
stupid girl to him.

1:20:19.315 --> 1:20:21.015
We're moving in together.

1:20:21.017 --> 1:20:21.982
What?

1:20:24.319 --> 1:20:26.453
Into his parents' place.

1:20:26.721 --> 1:20:28.088
What?

1:20:28.090 --> 1:20:31.292
They're gonna
let us live there.

1:20:31.294 --> 1:20:33.294
It's huge.

1:20:33.296 --> 1:20:34.795
It's got a pool
and everything.

1:20:34.797 --> 1:20:36.997
Right.
Mm-hmm.

1:20:40.902 --> 1:20:42.736
What about
your mom, Lily?

1:20:51.079 --> 1:20:53.280
Now she'll have
one less mouth to feed.

1:20:53.282 --> 1:20:55.149
What are you
talking about?

1:20:55.151 --> 1:20:57.484
You know what, Alison?

1:20:57.486 --> 1:20:59.486
You should go back
to the Salton Sea.

1:20:59.754 --> 1:21:01.255
You belong there.

1:21:01.257 --> 1:21:03.257
Don't say that.
Things are different now.

1:21:03.259 --> 1:21:04.925
No, they're not!

1:21:04.927 --> 1:21:08.495
Lily, nothing
has changed!
Nothing!

1:21:08.497 --> 1:21:11.765
Maybe not for you,
but they have for me.

1:21:17.072 --> 1:21:20.241
You're supposed
to be my best friend.

1:21:20.243 --> 1:21:23.944
Who the fuck else
was I supposed
to hang out with, huh?

1:21:26.181 --> 1:21:28.315
You were it.

1:21:36.524 --> 1:21:38.325
Fuck you.

1:21:55.443 --> 1:22:00.514
[quietly crying]

1:22:18.166 --> 1:22:21.201
Are you Lily?
Yeah.

1:22:21.203 --> 1:22:24.238
I wasn't sure I was
gonna find the place.
I came out from Whittier.

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:27.274
Passed by a couple times
to make sure there
weren't any cops.

1:22:27.276 --> 1:22:30.144
You're not a cop,
are you?
No.

1:22:30.146 --> 1:22:34.014
Yeah.
No, you look too young.
You're like a kid, huh?

1:22:34.016 --> 1:22:36.417
No, I'm 18.

1:22:36.419 --> 1:22:38.085
Okay.

1:22:38.087 --> 1:22:39.620
Want something
to eat or anything?

1:22:39.888 --> 1:22:43.257
I'm not really hungry.
Do you just want to go?

1:22:43.259 --> 1:22:46.527
I'm not hungry either.

1:22:46.529 --> 1:22:48.562
Go?

1:22:48.564 --> 1:22:51.932
Yeah, let's do it.
Cool.

1:22:51.934 --> 1:22:55.502
[gasping, crying]

1:23:01.876 --> 1:23:04.979
[starts truck]

1:23:13.488 --> 1:23:15.589
[sighs calmly]

1:23:20.128 --> 1:23:23.397
Where are we going?
I'm staying
in a motel just up here.

1:23:23.399 --> 1:23:25.599
Oh, good.

1:23:25.601 --> 1:23:28.235
Hey, do you have
a cigarette?
No.

1:23:28.237 --> 1:23:34.508
Oh, sorry.
I'm a little wired.
Do you party?

1:23:34.510 --> 1:23:36.610
It's right up here.
Oh, cool.

1:23:41.216 --> 1:23:44.918
You staying in here?
Yeah.

1:23:49.024 --> 1:23:51.058
I don't know,
I smell a trap.

1:23:51.060 --> 1:23:52.326
What are you
talking about?

1:23:52.328 --> 1:23:55.329
I don't know.
I don't know.

1:23:55.331 --> 1:23:57.164
What's wrong?

1:23:59.100 --> 1:24:01.301
I'm going to go in there
and your big black boyfriend

1:24:01.303 --> 1:24:04.071
is going to bash me
in the head with a pipe.

1:24:04.073 --> 1:24:05.572
No.

1:24:05.574 --> 1:24:07.241
Yeah?

1:24:10.078 --> 1:24:11.078
Come on.

1:24:17.552 --> 1:24:19.119
Ow!

1:24:19.121 --> 1:24:22.056
You gotta promise me.
What?

1:24:22.058 --> 1:24:24.091
Promise me that
I'm not gonna get
my head bashed in

1:24:24.093 --> 1:24:26.427
by some nigger
if I go in there.
Okay.

1:24:26.429 --> 1:24:29.196
'Cause I couldn't
handle that.

1:24:29.198 --> 1:24:32.232
I couldn't
fucking handle that.
Okay. I promise.

1:24:32.234 --> 1:24:35.202
Okay?
All right,
I promise.

1:25:06.167 --> 1:25:09.570
My room's right over here.

1:25:09.572 --> 1:25:10.604
Okay.

1:25:26.121 --> 1:25:28.589
You sure you're
all alone in here?

1:25:28.591 --> 1:25:29.756
Yeah.

1:25:38.533 --> 1:25:40.767
I'm sorry, you know,
it's just that...

1:25:45.707 --> 1:25:47.407
something seems
too good to be true...

1:25:53.181 --> 1:25:56.383
What's in there?
It's nothing.
It's just the bathroom.

1:26:03.124 --> 1:26:04.625
[noise outside]

1:26:11.332 --> 1:26:13.667
You don't get scared
here all by yourself?

1:26:24.546 --> 1:26:25.846
Take your clothes off.

1:26:29.484 --> 1:26:33.620
I want to see
what I'm getting into.

1:26:33.622 --> 1:26:36.623
What the fuck?
I like your eyes.
Mother fucker!

1:26:36.625 --> 1:26:39.259
Give me your fucking money!
Give me your fucking money!

1:26:39.261 --> 1:26:41.228
Oh, I knew it.
Give me your money!
You're a liar!

1:26:41.230 --> 1:26:42.696
Shut the fuck up
and empty your pockets.

1:26:42.698 --> 1:26:44.398
You gonna shoot me?
You gonna shoot me?

1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:46.466
Shut the fuck up
and empty your pockets.

1:26:46.468 --> 1:26:48.735
Oh, you're
gonna shoot me.
Shut up and
give me your money.

1:26:48.737 --> 1:26:51.205
Shut the fuck up!
Give me the money!

1:26:53.474 --> 1:26:55.142
What the fuck
are you doing?

1:26:58.513 --> 1:27:01.648
Do it. Do it.

1:27:01.650 --> 1:27:04.484
What the fuck
is wrong with you?
He's a fucking psycho.

1:27:04.486 --> 1:27:07.354
Hey.
Look man, we don't wanna
fucking hurt you, okay?

1:27:07.356 --> 1:27:08.789
So just get
the fuck outta here.

1:27:08.791 --> 1:27:11.458
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1:27:11.460 --> 1:27:13.527
Well, get the fuck
outta here, man!

1:27:13.529 --> 1:27:14.661
Come on.

1:27:16.497 --> 1:27:18.599
(scream)

1:27:18.601 --> 1:27:23.370
[yelling, crashing]

1:27:23.372 --> 1:27:26.873
Hey, Stop! Stop!
Get off him! Stop!

1:27:30.411 --> 1:27:31.411
No! No!

1:27:35.183 --> 1:27:37.551
We're sorry. Please.

1:27:39.721 --> 1:27:41.822
We're sorry.

1:27:41.824 --> 1:27:44.891
You're just a bunch
of fucking kids
screwing around.

1:27:44.893 --> 1:27:46.693
You're just a bunch
of fucking kids, huh?

1:27:46.695 --> 1:27:49.730
Cut it out, please.

1:27:49.732 --> 1:27:54.768
You're just a bunch
of fucking kids, huh?
Oh!

1:27:54.770 --> 1:28:03.410
Oh, why didn't you do it
when you had the chance,
and it was right in me?

1:28:03.412 --> 1:28:04.544
Jesse!

1:28:06.147 --> 1:28:07.881
Is that what you wanted?

1:28:07.883 --> 1:28:11.285
A little party? Huh?

1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:18.492
[Lily crying]

1:28:35.643 --> 1:28:36.610
(gunshot)

1:31:17.972 --> 1:31:21.808
(Alison)
You only get a little
time between a cut

1:31:21.810 --> 1:31:23.610
and knowing
how deep it is.

1:31:25.980 --> 1:31:29.950
If it's gonna
leave you nicked

1:31:29.952 --> 1:31:31.952
or disfigured forever.

1:31:37.558 --> 1:31:41.127
All you can do is try
to stretch out that moment

1:31:41.429 --> 1:31:43.396
for as long
as you possibly can.

1:31:47.435 --> 1:31:50.704
'Cause once you know...

1:31:50.706 --> 1:31:50.737
there ain't no coming back.
