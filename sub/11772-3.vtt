00:06.333 --> 00:08.533
( theme music playing )

00:13.933 --> 00:17.633
( shoes squeaking )

00:22.600 --> 00:24.233
Man: HOW DO THOSEFEEL TO YOU?

00:24.267 --> 00:26.733
WELL, THEY FEEL
PRETTY GOOD.

00:26.767 --> 00:28.200
I KINDA LIKE
THESE ORTHOTICS.

00:28.233 --> 00:31.467
YEAH, THEY'RE REALLY
GOING TO HELP.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
BOY, THEY SURE
MAKE A LOT OF NOISE.

00:36.033 --> 00:38.400
THEY TAKE A WHILE
TO WORK IN.

00:44.167 --> 00:47.833
( singing in Hebrew )

00:50.100 --> 00:51.700
AH, Jesús!

00:53.333 --> 00:55.067
HOW ARE YOU?

00:56.200 --> 00:59.033
- EVERYTHING OKAY?
- SI.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.633
YEAH? YOU SEEM
A LITTLE DOWN.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.433
- NO, I-I OKAY.
- YOU OKAY?

01:03.467 --> 01:05.867
- SI.
- CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

01:05.900 --> 01:08.100
SMALL FAVOR, OKAY?

01:08.133 --> 01:10.333
SMALL FAVOR--
IT'S HARDLY EVEN A FAVOR.

01:10.367 --> 01:12.300
YOU WORK HERE, ACTUALLY,
SO IT'S PART OF YOUR JOB.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.367
EITHER WAY, IT'S STILL
A FAVOR. OKAY.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.933
SO I GOT, UH--
SEE THIS THING?

01:17.967 --> 01:19.600
IT'S A MEZUZAH.

01:19.633 --> 01:22.433
GOT THAT?
AND I NEED YOU

01:22.467 --> 01:26.067
TO PUT IT
OVER THE DOOR HERE.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.700
THIS IS LIKE
A JEWISH THING.

01:27.733 --> 01:29.267
YOU KNOW, WE PUT IT
OVER THE DOOR

01:29.300 --> 01:33.200
SO EVERY ANTI-SEMITE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WILL
KNOW THAT WE LIVE HERE

01:33.233 --> 01:34.867
IN CASE THEY WANNA
BURN DOWN THE HOUSE.

01:34.900 --> 01:38.267
ANYWAY, YOU JUST NEED A NAIL.
GET A NAIL, HAMMER AND A NAIL,

01:38.300 --> 01:40.300
- PUT IT UP.
- SI, MEZUZAH.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.733
YEAH, MEZUZAH.
I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT DOES, REALLY.

01:42.767 --> 01:45.633
BUT ANYWAY,
BECAUSE MY FATHER'S
COMING TO VISIT,

01:45.667 --> 01:48.100
HE'LL BE UPSET
IF HE DOESN'T SEE
IT UP THERE.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.400
HE'S A LITTLE
HARD-OF-HEARING,
SO WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM,

01:49.433 --> 01:52.767
TALK LOUD.
HE'S LOSING HIS HEARING.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.400
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

01:54.433 --> 01:55.733
SO YOU JUST SPEAK UP
A LITTLE BIT--

01:55.767 --> 01:57.167
( loudly )
"HELLO, HELLO?"

01:57.200 --> 01:59.100
- YOU KNOW.
- ( loudly ) "HELLO?

01:59.133 --> 02:01.567
- HELLO?"
- YEAH, "HOW DO YOU FEEL,
MR. DAVID?"

02:03.867 --> 02:05.867
"HOW DO YOU FEEL,
MR. DAVID?"

02:05.900 --> 02:08.367
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD, Jesús.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.367
BY THE WAY, Jesús--
JESUS-- EITHER ONE?

02:11.400 --> 02:14.067
EITHER ONE, SI.
IT'S OKAY.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.933
- SAME THING.
- SI.

02:15.967 --> 02:17.733
OKAY, OKAY.

02:17.767 --> 02:20.400
- I DO MEZUZAH.
- OKAY, GREAT.

02:20.433 --> 02:23.833
WHAT HA--
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR LEG?

02:23.867 --> 02:27.067
IT HURTS ON THE BOTTOM
OF MY FEET.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.067
I HAVE THE EXACT
SAME THING!

02:29.067 --> 02:31.500
DO YOU WANT YOUR LIFE
CHANGED, JESUS?

02:31.533 --> 02:33.200
HUH? OKAY.

02:33.233 --> 02:35.900
SEE THIS?
IT'S CALLED AN ORTHOTIC.

02:35.933 --> 02:39.200
JUST PUT 'EM IN THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR SHOE,

02:39.233 --> 02:40.333
AND THAT'S IT.

02:40.367 --> 02:41.800
NO NO NO,
I DO THE MEZUZAH--

02:41.833 --> 02:43.733
- HUH?
- ( speaks Spanish )

02:43.767 --> 02:45.600
- TRY THEM ON!
- TELL THEM, MARIA.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.367
HONEY, WHAT COULD IT HURT?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
IT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

02:49.433 --> 02:52.500
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
THERE YOU GO.

02:52.533 --> 02:55.233
- OKAY.
- IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
GRACIAS, MR. LARRY.

02:55.267 --> 02:58.167
- DE NADA.
- THANK YOU.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.667
DE NADA.* DE NADA.

03:02.700 --> 03:06.567
( shoes continue
squeaking )

03:06.600 --> 03:09.433
- WHAT IS THAT NOISE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:09.467 --> 03:10.667
- HEY.
- IS THAT YOU?

03:10.700 --> 03:13.533
- WHAT?
- WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

03:13.567 --> 03:14.867
OH, THE ORTHOTICS.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.267
- UGH...
- WHAT?

03:16.300 --> 03:18.067
- IT'S LOUD!
- WELL, YOU GOTTA
BREAK 'EM IN.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.367
IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.933
THEY'RE REALLY LOUD.

03:21.967 --> 03:23.533
WELL, THEY'RE VERY GOOD
FOR MY FEET, I COULD
TELL YOU THAT.

03:23.567 --> 03:26.167
- MY FEET FEEL A LOT BETTER.
- THAT'S GOOD.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.800
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING:

03:28.833 --> 03:31.100
WHY IS IT THAT
BEFORE YOU HAVE A MEAL,

03:31.133 --> 03:34.167
YOU DO THE WHOLE CROSS THING,
BUT NOT FOR A SNACK.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.700
I DON'T THINK
IT APPLIES TO SNACKS.

03:36.733 --> 03:39.333
I GUESS, OTHERWISE YOU'D BE
CROSSING ALL DAY LONG.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.867
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A MAXIMUM NUMBER

03:41.900 --> 03:43.633
OF TIMES SOMEBODY
CAN CROSS IN A DAY.

03:43.667 --> 03:46.067
UH, I WONDER
WHAT THE RECORD IS.

03:46.067 --> 03:48.200
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANY CROSSING ON A SNACK, EVER?

03:48.233 --> 03:49.767
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- EXCUSE ME.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.833
I'M GONNA BE ON THE LOOKOUTFOR
PEOPLE WHO CROSSBEFORE
SNACKING.

03:52.867 --> 03:54.500
WHAT'S THAT?

03:54.533 --> 03:55.600
- THIS?
- YEAH.

03:55.633 --> 03:56.967
THIS IS A NAIL.

03:57.067 --> 03:59.200
I BOUGHT THIS
ON THE INTERNET.

03:59.233 --> 04:01.500
IT'S FROM "THE PASSION
OF THE CHRIST."

04:01.533 --> 04:03.867
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

04:03.900 --> 04:06.533
NO.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.300
- KIND OF INTERESTING--
- YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE
CHRIST NAILS

04:08.333 --> 04:10.367
- FROM THE MOVIE?
- MM-HMM, YEP.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.267
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

04:11.300 --> 04:13.700
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

04:13.733 --> 04:15.267
- ALL RIGHT, YOU MUST--
- MISSED "PASSION OF
THE CHRIST."

04:15.300 --> 04:18.100
- WE HAVE IT ON DVD.
- WISH I COULD HAVE GONE.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.567
THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF
THINGS IN THE INTERNET

04:19.600 --> 04:20.833
FOR "THE PASSION
OF THE CHRIST."

04:20.867 --> 04:22.467
YOU'RE NUTS ABOUT THIS
JESUS GUY, AREN'T YOU?

04:22.500 --> 04:24.767
YEAH, I HAVE A PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.333
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.533
I CAN SEE WORSHIPPING JESUS
IF HE WERE A GIRL.

04:28.567 --> 04:32.200
LIKE IF GOD HAD
A DAUGHTER... JANE.
I'LL WORSHIP A JANE.

04:32.233 --> 04:35.167
- NO.
- BUT, YOU KNOW,
TO WORSHIP A GUY...

04:35.200 --> 04:36.467
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE
KINDA, YOU KNOW,

04:36.500 --> 04:37.467
IT'S A LITTLE GAY,
ISN'T IT?

04:37.500 --> 04:39.067
- OKAY.
- THE SON OF GOD!

04:39.067 --> 04:41.300
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
- NO, I'M JUST SAYING.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.167
A GIRL--
I WOULD WORSHIP JANE--

04:43.200 --> 04:44.333
IF HE HAD
A DAUGHTER JANE,

04:44.367 --> 04:46.100
I COULD HAVE A
RELATIONSHIPWITH A JANE.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.900
- HE DIDN'T HAVE A DAUGHTER!
- IT'S A SHAME IT WASN'T A GIRL.

04:47.933 --> 04:49.367
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

04:49.400 --> 04:53.067
- GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN,
ZAFTIG, YOU KNOW?
- OKAY.

04:53.067 --> 04:55.633
- GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.
- NO NO NO.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.667
- WE GOT IT.
- IF HE HAD A DAUGHTER,
EVERYBODY--

04:57.700 --> 04:59.667
- EVERYBODY
WOULD WORSHIP JANE.
- STOP IT.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.433
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

05:25.633 --> 05:28.133
- LARRY?
- WHAT?

05:29.067 --> 05:30.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:30.333 --> 05:33.067
- WHAT-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT? NOTHING.

05:33.067 --> 05:36.067
I WAS--
YOUR BRA WAS KIND OF--
IT WAS ABOUT TO FALL OFF

05:36.100 --> 05:38.067
AND I WAS-- I WAS
PUTTING IT BACK ON.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.467
ALL RIGHT, AND...

05:40.500 --> 05:43.167
I FELT LIKE
YOU WERE LOOKING AT...

05:43.200 --> 05:45.900
MY SIZE.

05:45.933 --> 05:47.967
OH, UM...

05:48.067 --> 05:49.333
I--

05:49.367 --> 05:51.100
WELL...

05:52.733 --> 05:55.067
I DIDN'T DELIBERATELY
SET OUT TO LOOK AT THE SIZE,

05:55.067 --> 05:56.900
BUT I WAS--
I HAD THE BRA IN MY HAND,

05:56.933 --> 06:00.500
AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE,
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE

06:00.533 --> 06:02.533
YOU CHECK OUT THE DATE
OF BIRTH. THAT'S ALL.

06:02.567 --> 06:05.233
- OKAY.
- I CHECKED IT OUT.

06:05.267 --> 06:06.433
AND WHAT'D YOU THINK?

06:06.467 --> 06:09.600
YEAH....

06:09.633 --> 06:11.067
OKAY, IT WAS GOOD.

06:11.067 --> 06:13.600
UM...

06:13.633 --> 06:15.800
WELL, WHILE WE'RE
ON THE SUBJECT,

06:15.833 --> 06:19.633
UH, I THINK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LET MARIA GO.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.667
- I CANNOT...
- REALLY?

06:21.700 --> 06:25.900
STAND TO WATCH HER
CLEAN ROOM TO ROOM

06:25.933 --> 06:28.367
WITHOUT A BRA.
IT'S VERY DISTRACTING.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.067
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S
A BIG MOVE.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.067
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL HER TO PUT
A BRA ON?

06:32.067 --> 06:34.100
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION
WITH SOMEONE.

06:34.133 --> 06:35.900
I WOULD RATHER
JUST GET RID OF HER.

06:35.933 --> 06:37.667
- WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.
- REALLY?

06:37.700 --> 06:40.433
FIRST OF ALL,
SHE MAKES THE BEST
CHICKEN SALAD.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.667
I WOULD REALLY
MISS THAT.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.500
WELL, LARRY,
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TELL HER TO WEAR A BRA

06:45.533 --> 06:47.500
OR FIRE HER.

06:50.567 --> 06:52.533
- IF I SEE--
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL--
I'LL TELL HER.

06:52.567 --> 06:53.867
- I'LL TELL HER
TO PUT THE BRA ON.
- OKAY.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.467
I'LL TALK TO HER.
I'LL TALK TO HER,
NO PROBLEM.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.700
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

06:57.733 --> 06:59.733
- ALL RIGHT.
- I GOT IT.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.633
- YOU DONE WITH THIS?
- YEAH, I AM.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.233
YOU DONE?

07:09.433 --> 07:11.833
( shoes squeaking )

07:13.800 --> 07:15.867
OH HI, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE Jesús!

07:15.900 --> 07:17.333
- Jesús!
- YEAH.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.433
- NO KIDDING.
- YEAH, HIS SHOES
ARE LIKE YOUR SHOES.

07:19.467 --> 07:21.400
- YEAH?
- YEAH, THEY'RE VERY LOUD.

07:21.433 --> 07:23.067
THEY MAKE A LOT OF NOISE.
YOU GOTTA BREAK THEM IN.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.633
YEAH, BUT HIS FEET
FEEL REALLY GOOD.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.200
- THEY'RE BETTER?
- SI, YEAH.

07:26.233 --> 07:27.833
- FANTASTIC!
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

07:27.867 --> 07:29.167
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- IT'S GOOD.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.733
- THEY FIT AND EVERYTHING?
- MM-HMM!

07:30.767 --> 07:32.400
- IS HE HAPPY?
- YES.

07:32.433 --> 07:34.633
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

07:34.667 --> 07:38.700
- HE COULD BE QUITE A DOWNER
THIS GUY, THIS Jesús.
- YES, I KNOW.

07:38.733 --> 07:39.567
HE'S GOOD.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.433
- MARIA?
- YEAH?

07:41.467 --> 07:44.600
UH, I GOT A LITTLE THING
I NEED TO TALK ABOUT WITH YOU.

07:44.633 --> 07:46.067
OKAY.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.567
CHERYL AND I WERE
HAVING A CONVERSATION
THE OTHER NIGHT.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.467
WELL, LAST NIGHT,
ACTUALLY.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.567
YOU KNOW, WE COULDN'T
HELP BUT NOTICE

07:54.600 --> 07:57.567
THAT, UH, YOU DON'T
WEAR A, UH...

07:57.600 --> 07:59.100
BRA.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.167
OH, NO.
DON'T LIKE 'EM.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.200
NOT FOR ME.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.833
- NOT FOR YOU?
- NO.

08:03.867 --> 08:06.067
HMM.

08:06.067 --> 08:08.900
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW I GOT
MY FATHER-IN-LAW HERE.

08:08.933 --> 08:10.833
- MMM HMM?
- THEY'RE KIND
OF DISTRACTING.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.267
DISTRACTING?

08:12.300 --> 08:14.400
YEAH, A LOT OF
FLOPPING GOING ON.

08:14.433 --> 08:17.267
- NO, THEY DON'T FLOP--
- THERE'S FLOPPIN'!

08:17.300 --> 08:20.333
DON'T LIKE THE SUPPORT THINGS,
THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.300
I HAVEN'T WORN ONE
IN 15 YEARS.

08:22.333 --> 08:27.100
THEY'VE MADE SOME GREAT
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES
IN BRAS IN 15 YEARS.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.667
THEY'RE INVITING
AND COZY AND COTTONY.

08:29.700 --> 08:30.933
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THAT COTTON?

08:30.967 --> 08:33.567
PUMA?
THAT'S A SNEAKER.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.967
ALL RIGHT...
PIMA! PIMA!

08:36.067 --> 08:38.267
NO, I DON'T LIKE 'EM.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.067
- YOU DON'T LIKE 'EM.
- MMM MMM.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.767
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GONNA DO FOR YOU.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.167
I'M GONNA BUY YOU A BRA,
HOW ABOUT THAT?

08:44.200 --> 08:45.433
I'LL BUY YOU ONE, YOU'LL

08:45.467 --> 08:47.067
YOU'LL PUT IT ON,
YOU'LL SEE WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

MY TREAT.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.067
- OKAY, I'LL TRY IT.

08:51.100 --> 08:53.400
I'LL JUST TRY IT ON
AND LET'S SEE.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.967
I'M GONNA GET YOU A BRA.

09:01.667 --> 09:02.733
Larry:
WHERE ARE YOU?

09:02.767 --> 09:04.467
Jeff:
I'M IN THE KITCHEN.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.900
( shoes squeak )

09:06.933 --> 09:09.533
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

09:09.567 --> 09:10.933
OH, MY ORTHOTICS.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.533
WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH THAT?

09:12.567 --> 09:14.200
WELL, I GOT THESE NEW
ORTHOTICS, YOU KNOW--

09:14.233 --> 09:16.133
- IS IT ALWAYS
GONNA SOUND THAT WAY?
- YOU NEED TO BREAK 'EM IN.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.367
- OKAY--
- BUT MY FOOT?

09:18.400 --> 09:19.900
- YEAH?
- GOOD NIGHT, NURSE.

09:19.933 --> 09:21.333
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

09:21.367 --> 09:24.300
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

09:24.333 --> 09:27.333
- THANK YOU.
- BEER?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.733
- HMMM. MAYBE LATER.
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IF YOU WANT ONE,

09:29.767 --> 09:31.533
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIND MY CAN OPENER.

09:31.567 --> 09:35.667
I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING.
I GOT A HOUSEKEEPER WHO STEALS.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.300
- REALLY?
- OH YEAH.

09:39.333 --> 09:40.900
SO IT'S JUST A CAN OPENER,
YOU MIGHT NOT THINK IT'S MUCH.

09:40.933 --> 09:43.200
BUT EVERYTHING
I LOOK FOR, GONE!

09:43.233 --> 09:45.567
- WHY DON'T YOU FIRE HER?
- 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.900
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE.

09:46.933 --> 09:49.200
- GEE, I HATE TO HEAR THAT.
- I KNOW, IT'S HORRIBLE.

09:49.233 --> 09:53.800
OF COURSE, MY HOUSEKEEPER,
I HAD TO TELL HER
TO WEAR A BRA.

09:53.833 --> 09:55.400
YOU HAD TO TELL YOURHOUSEKEEPER
TO WEAR A BRA?

09:55.433 --> 09:59.233
I AM BUYING HER--
I HAVE TO BUY HER A BRA.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.800
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT SIZE SHE IS.

10:01.833 --> 10:04.300
Susie:
HONEY...

10:04.333 --> 10:07.400
- SAMMI'S LAST TOOTH
FINALLY FELL OUT.
- OH, GREAT, GREAT!

10:07.433 --> 10:08.567
LOOK AT THAT, HUH?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.500
YEAH, TOOTH FAIRY'LL
BE COMING TONIGHT.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.767
WAIT A SECOND, WHAT IS THIS?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.300
WHAT, TOOTH FAIRY.

10:14.333 --> 10:15.900
- TOOTH FAIRY?
- Both: YEAH.

10:15.933 --> 10:17.867
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?
SHE'S LIKE 11 YEARS OLD.

10:17.900 --> 10:21.233
IT'S NONE OF YOUR
GOD DAMN BUSINESS, LARRY.

10:21.267 --> 10:23.833
HER TOOTH FALLS OUT,
WE STICK IT UNDER HER PILLOW.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.100
SHE STILL BELIEVES
IN THE TOOTH FAIRY?

10:26.133 --> 10:29.100
YES, SHE STILL BELIEVES.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THAT?

10:29.133 --> 10:30.667
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.333
JESUS CHRIST,
I'M SHOCKED.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.333
WHAT'S SO SHOCKING?
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
CHILDREN.

10:36.367 --> 10:38.500
YOU DON'T KNOW
CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,

10:38.533 --> 10:40.133
AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE
AND DON'T BELIEVE.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.767
- I GUESS I DON'T.
- NO!

10:41.800 --> 10:43.767
I KNEW THERE WAS NO
TOOTH FAIRY EVEN BEFORE
MY TEETH FELL OUT.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.500
REALLY?MAYBE THAT'S
WHATYOUR PROBLEM IS.

10:45.533 --> 10:48.067
MAYBE IF YOU HAD FAITH
OR A BELIEF IN SOMETHING

10:48.100 --> 10:52.433
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
ENDED UP THE WAY YOU DID,
YOU KNOW?

10:52.467 --> 10:53.600
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

10:53.633 --> 10:56.433
WHAT?
NO, NOTHING.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.033
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

10:58.067 --> 11:00.367
YEAH, MY PLEASURE.
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.133
DO ME A FAVOR?
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT,
JUST LEAVE US ALONE.

11:03.167 --> 11:05.633
- FINE, MY PLEASURE.
- THANK YOU.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.733
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

11:08.767 --> 11:12.600
I THINK SHE'S ABOUT THE SAME
SIZE AS MARIA MY HOUSEKEEPER.

11:12.633 --> 11:14.400
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

11:14.433 --> 11:17.300
- YOU KNOW WHAT SIZE SHE IS?
- NO. I CAN FIND OUT.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.900
- WOULD YOU?
- SURE.

11:18.933 --> 11:21.867
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
CHERYL'S SIZE IS?

11:21.900 --> 11:25.233
I JUST FOUND OUT,
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.267
- A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.
- REALLY?

11:27.300 --> 11:29.367
WHAT, "B" CUP?

11:29.400 --> 11:30.367
- I'D RATHER NOT SAY.
- "C"?

11:30.400 --> 11:33.100
- I CAN'T, YOU KNOW--
- 32? 34?

11:33.133 --> 11:34.533
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.
- COME ON.

11:34.567 --> 11:35.600
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

11:35.633 --> 11:37.267
- COME ON!
- NO!

11:37.300 --> 11:40.300
I'M GIVING YOU
SUSIE'S BRA SIZE,
GIVE ME CHERYL'S BRA SIZE.

11:40.333 --> 11:44.467
- IT'S A TRADE.
- I CAN'T, I DON'T WANT TO.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.100
YOU DON'T TELL ME CHERYL'S,
I AIN'T TELLING YOU SUSIE'S.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.633
- OKAY. FINE.
- OKAY. FINE.

11:50.667 --> 11:51.767
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO HAS
TO GO OUT AND BUY A BRA.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.767
- I DON'T VE A SHIT.
- OH, YEAH, YOU DO.

11:56.767 --> 11:59.333
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE,
ISN'T IT?

11:59.367 --> 12:01.400
- I COULD BE GENERAL MANAGER
OF A BASKETBALL TEAM.
- NO, YOU COULDN'T.

12:01.433 --> 12:04.167
- I COULD PUT TOGETHER
A BETTER TEAM--
- YOU COULD NOT.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.867
- DON'T TELL ME I COULDN'T!
- YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.400
HALF THE THINGS YOU SAY
HERE ON THE COUCH--

12:08.433 --> 12:11.233
I KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT
BASKETBALL AS THESE IDIOTS.

12:11.267 --> 12:12.933
I JUST NEED
THE OPPORTUNITY.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.467
THAT'S ALL, JUST
THE OPPORTUNITY.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.833
A YOUNG, FRESH KID OUT
OF COLLEGE JUST NEEDS
THE OPPORTUNITY.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.433
I DO!
I KNOW I COULD DO IT.

12:20.467 --> 12:23.300
- WHERE YOU GOING?
- BATHROOM.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.100
( shoes squeaking )

13:09.267 --> 13:11.700
( toilet flushes )

13:15.900 --> 13:19.333
( shoes squeaking )

13:22.067 --> 13:25.900
( squeaking grows louder )

13:25.933 --> 13:28.433
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT MONEY?

13:28.467 --> 13:31.167
I WAS CHECKING TO MAKE SURE
THE TOOTH FAIRY LEFT IT.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.300
YOU'RE LYING!
YOU'RE A LIAR!
YOU'RE THE TOOTH FAIRY!

13:33.333 --> 13:34.600
THERE IS NO TOOTH FAIRY!

13:34.633 --> 13:39.300
- THERE IS A TOOTH FAIRY.
- YOU'RE LYING! IT'S YOU!

13:39.333 --> 13:40.267
I'M GONNA KILL HIM!

13:40.300 --> 13:42.433
IT'S YOU!
YOU'RE THE TOOTH FAIRY!

13:42.467 --> 13:44.067
- YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU JUST DID?
- WHAT?

13:44.100 --> 13:48.567
SAMMI CAUGHT ME PUTTING
THE MONEY UNDER HER PILLOW.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.500
BECAUSE YOU WOKE HER UP WITH
THOSE THINGS IN YOUR SHOES,

13:51.533 --> 13:53.833
- AND NOW SHE KNOWS
THAT I'M THE TOOTH FAIRY.
- REALLY?

13:53.867 --> 13:56.067
- THE SHOES WOKE HER UP?
- YES, THE SHOES WOKE HER UP!

13:56.067 --> 13:59.067
SHE KNOWS THAT THERE'S NO
TOOTH FAIRY NOW!

13:59.067 --> 14:01.067
- I'M SORRY.
- OH, YOU'RE SORRY?

14:01.100 --> 14:02.800
I'M HER MOTHER!
TRUST!

14:02.833 --> 14:05.467
I KNOW, BUT IT HAD
TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

14:05.500 --> 14:09.633
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A STUPID
FUCKING IDIOT! I CANNOT
LISTEN TO THIS!

14:09.667 --> 14:12.900
JEFF, DO YOU HEAR THIS?
"IT HAD TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY."

14:12.933 --> 14:15.300
- WHAT HAD TO HAPPEN?
- HIS ORTHOTICS, WHATEVER
THE HELL THEY ARE,

14:15.333 --> 14:18.800
- THE NOISE WOKE SAMMI UP.
- WHAT'S WITH YOUR FARCHADAT
SHOES?

14:18.833 --> 14:20.533
I TOLD YOU IT TAKES
A WHILE TO BREAK 'EM IN.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.833
WHAT ARE YOU BREAKING
'EM IN IN MY HOUSE FOR?
IT'S CRAZY!

14:22.867 --> 14:25.500
UH, YOU KNOW...

14:25.533 --> 14:27.467
LET ME JUST POSIT THIS,
OKAY?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.333
IT MIGHT BE A BLESSING
IN DISGUISE.

14:29.367 --> 14:32.067
- HOW?
- THE KID'S 11 YEARS OLD,
ALREADY.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.167
ENOUGH WITH
THE TOOTH FAIRY!

14:33.200 --> 14:35.900
NOT YOUR BUSINESS, LARRY,
YOU MISANTHROPIC MORON!

14:35.933 --> 14:38.300
NOT FOR YOU TO JUDGE!
SHE'S OUR KID,

14:38.333 --> 14:40.800
WE DECIDE WHEN SHE KNOWS
ABOUT THE TOOTH FAIRY!

14:40.833 --> 14:43.633
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE PROPAGATED THIS
RIDICULOUS MYTH!

14:43.667 --> 14:45.167
GET THE FUCK OUT
OF MY HOUSE!

14:45.200 --> 14:47.700
- YOU SURE?
- YES!

14:51.500 --> 14:53.833
( shoes squeaking )

14:59.067 --> 15:01.733
( shoes squeaking )

15:08.400 --> 15:11.067
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:11.067 --> 15:12.567
WHAT IS IT?

15:12.600 --> 15:15.767
LARRY, GET RID OF
THOSE ORTHOTICS!

15:18.367 --> 15:20.433
NOW I'LL NEVER
GET BACK TO SLEEP!

15:38.900 --> 15:40.400
MAY I HELP YOU?

15:40.433 --> 15:43.367
YES, HI, UM...

15:43.400 --> 15:45.133
YEAH, I'M INTERESTED
IN, UM...

15:45.167 --> 15:47.367
IN BUYING A, UH...

15:47.400 --> 15:49.100
...BRA.

15:49.133 --> 15:51.400
- FOR YOUR--
- IT'S NOT FOR ME, NO.

15:51.433 --> 15:53.800
FOR YOUR SWEETHEART
OR YOUR WIFE?
GIRLFRIEND?

15:53.833 --> 15:56.200
ACTUALLY,
MY HOUSEKEEPER.

15:56.233 --> 15:58.300
OH, HOUSEKEEPER, OKAY.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.233
I'M NOT MAKING IT UP.
IT'S REALLY NOT FOR ME.

16:00.267 --> 16:02.200
FINE, NO IT'S NOT--
OF COURSE IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

16:02.233 --> 16:05.433
- TELL ME YOU BELIEVE ME.
- I BELIEVE YOU, OF COURSE NOT!

16:05.467 --> 16:07.933
- NOT THAT THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.
- NO--

16:07.967 --> 16:09.700
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH IT.

16:09.733 --> 16:11.833
- THERE'S A LOT WRONG WITH IT.
- YOU CAN'T SAY THAT IN THIS
DAY AND AGE.

16:11.867 --> 16:13.933
I LIKE TO WALK AROUND
WITH UNDERWEAR ON MY HEAD.

16:13.967 --> 16:16.633
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT?

16:16.667 --> 16:18.600
- YEAH, THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THAT.
- THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

16:18.633 --> 16:21.067
- SO YOU REALLY DO
NEED A BRA, THEN?
- YES.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.667
SOMETHING COMFORTABLE.
SHE HASN'T WORN ONE IN
15 YEARS.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.600
- NOT A FRENCH MAID OUTFIT?
- NO, IT'S NOT A LACEY FRENCH
MAID OUTFIT.

16:26.633 --> 16:29.833
- 'CAUSE WE HAVE LOTS OF THOSE.
- THIS FEELS VERY NICE.

16:29.867 --> 16:33.067
- YES, THIS IS OUR
REVOLUTIONARY "ELASTICENE."
- YEAH.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.067
- THIS IS THE ONE--
- LOVELY.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.200
THIS IS THE BEST BRA
WE MAKE.

16:37.233 --> 16:39.400
IT'S SO SOFT, I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE THAT.

16:39.433 --> 16:43.167
- IN FACT, THIS ONE--
- I WONDER IF THEY MAKE
UNDERWEAR OUT OF THIS STUFF.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.333
THEY DO.
WE HAVE MATCHING PANTIES.

16:45.367 --> 16:47.300
NO, FOR ME, FOR MEN.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.833
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

16:49.867 --> 16:53.233
FEEL FREE TO TRY ON ANYTHING
HERE THAT YOU WANT.

16:53.267 --> 16:54.500
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

16:54.533 --> 16:56.800
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S FOR ME.
IT'S NOT FOR ME.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.767
I'M JUST SAYING
THIS KIND OF FOAMY,
SOFT MATERIAL

16:59.800 --> 17:04.233
- WOULD BE NICE
DOWN THERE FOR ME.
- IT'S SO SMOOTH, YES.

17:04.267 --> 17:05.733
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
A PERVERT...

17:05.767 --> 17:07.100
THERE'S NOTHING PERVERTED
ABOUT IT!

17:07.133 --> 17:09.300
...JUST 'CAUSE I WANT
TO WEAR UNDERWEAR MADE
OUT OF A BRA.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.967
LET'S FIGURE OUT
WHAT THIS WOMAN HAS...

17:15.600 --> 17:17.567
GOT A GOOD SELECTION
FOR YOU HERE.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.067
AND THE ONLY ISSUE,
OF COURSE, IS THE SIZE,

17:20.067 --> 17:23.700
WHICH I HAVE TO SAY I DIDN'T
REALLY KNOW YOUR SIZE.

17:23.733 --> 17:26.067
I GOT A FEELING I THINK
I NAILED IT.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.233
I REALLY DO!

17:27.267 --> 17:29.267
OKAY, TRY THEM ALL ON.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.700
- ALL RIGHT?
- THANK YOU, MR. DAVID.

17:30.733 --> 17:32.333
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:35.733 --> 17:39.267
( shoes squeaking )

17:41.600 --> 17:43.300
HEY.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.233
YOU'RE A SICK FUCK,
YOU KNOW THAT?

17:45.267 --> 17:46.900
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:46.933 --> 17:50.200
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
OUR HOUSEKEEPER'S BEEN
STEALING, LARRY,

17:50.233 --> 17:52.167
SO WE INSTALLED CAMERAS
THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.933
LAUNDRY ROOM.
I LOOKED AT THE TAPE.

17:59.267 --> 18:00.900
Susie:
QUITE A SHOW, LARRY.

18:00.933 --> 18:02.233
LOOK FAMILIAR?

18:02.267 --> 18:04.433
Larry:
SO, I'M LOOKING AT
THE SIZE OF IT.

18:04.467 --> 18:06.667
I NEEDED TO BUY A BRA
FOR THE HOUSEKEEPER,

18:06.700 --> 18:09.067
AND IT SEEMED LIKE
YOU TWO WERE THE SAME SIZE.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.400
SO I NEEDED TO FIND OUT
WHAT YOUR SIZE WAS!

18:10.433 --> 18:12.733
AND WHAT'S ALL THIS
MINCING AROUND?
WHAT IS THIS?

18:12.767 --> 18:14.933
Larry:
I WAS TRYING TO IMAGINE
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

18:14.967 --> 18:17.067
TO BE THE HOUSEKEEPER
AND HAVE THOSE BREASTS

18:17.067 --> 18:19.367
YOU KNOW, WORKING
AND DOING DISHES.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.800
Susie: AND HOW DID THAT
FEEL?DID IT FEEL GOOD?

18:21.833 --> 18:24.533
THIS IS HOW YOUR HOUSEKEEPER
WASHES DISHES, LIKE THIS?

18:24.567 --> 18:28.633
HUH? THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES?SHE
DANCES, MINCING
AROUND,WASHING DISHES?

18:28.667 --> 18:30.200
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT HER BREASTS?

18:30.233 --> 18:33.967
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU WOULD WALK INTO
HER LAUNDRY ROOM

18:34.067 --> 18:35.633
AND START RIFLING
THROUGH HER UNDERWEAR.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.300
I JUST HAPPENED TO SEE
THE BRA THERE, SO I THOUGHT,

18:38.333 --> 18:42.133
HEY LOOK AT THAT,
SHE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT
THE SAME SIZE AS MARIA!

18:42.167 --> 18:44.667
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
STARING AT EVERYONE'S
BREASTS?

18:44.700 --> 18:47.333
- YEAH, EXACTLY!
- NO, I KNEW I HAD TO BUY
HER A BRA AND I THOUGHT--

18:47.367 --> 18:50.667
WHY ARE YOU
BUYING HER A BRA!
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.233
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
MADE ME GET A BRA FOR
HER IN THE FIRST PLACE!

18:52.267 --> 18:55.300
I NEVER SAID GO BUY HER A BRA!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

18:55.333 --> 18:57.600
YOU WANTED HER
TO PUT A BRA ON,
AND I WAS JUST FINE--

18:57.633 --> 19:00.100
Cheryl: YOU DON'T
WALKAROUND LOOKING--

19:00.133 --> 19:03.133
IT'S DISGUSTING.
KEEP YOU GODDAMN HANDS
OFF MY BRASSIERE, OKAY?

19:03.167 --> 19:04.833
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
IT'S HAPPENED.

19:04.867 --> 19:08.700
THE OTHER DAY HE'S RIFLING
THROUGH MY THINGS LOOKING
AT MY LABELS.

19:08.733 --> 19:10.167
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED 11 YEARS.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.700
SO I TOOK A LITTLE PEEK
AT HER BRA SIZE, BIG DEAL.

19:12.733 --> 19:14.733
SO SUE ME! LOCK ME UP!

19:14.767 --> 19:16.800
PERVERT!

20:32.500 --> 20:35.667
SO HE SAID, "MR. DAVID

YOU'RE GONNA NEED A NAIL.
