[parent] Welcome to our family.
We're the Bakers.

We're a big family full of big dreamers.

Right now, our dream is getting everyone
out of the house on time.

02:22.083 --> 02:23.083
[both] We got this.

02:23.166 --> 02:24.875
All right, I got the boys and the littles.

02:24.958 --> 02:26.500
-Yeah, I'll get Dej.
-Okay.

02:28.583 --> 02:29.750
[Paul] This is DJ.

02:29.833 --> 02:33.958
He dreams of being the world's greatest
Lego designer and comic book artist.

02:34.041 --> 02:35.041
It could happen.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.500
Deej. Rise and shine.

02:36.583 --> 02:37.625
-Haresh!
-[children groan]

02:37.708 --> 02:40.708
Up and at 'em.
We got a restaurant to run. Let's go!

02:40.791 --> 02:44.458
[Paul] This is Haresh. He dreams
of being a player. It's not happening.

02:44.541 --> 02:47.291
Last I checked, players don't sleep
with their teddy bears.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.375
All right.

-Yes! Whoo!

02:58.750 --> 03:01.166

-The crowd goes wild!

03:01.250 --> 03:02.583
[both] Whoo!

03:04.625 --> 03:07.166
-All right, rise and shine!

03:07.250 --> 03:10.041
-They dream of getting bigger.

[Zoey] This is Ella.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.958
She dreams of being an influencer.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.791
Wake up, Ella, or this picture

03:44.250 --> 03:46.208
-Laundry chute.
-We have a laundry chute?

03:46.291 --> 03:47.541
Yeah. Keep up, Dad.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.125
Dude, I got a new follower.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.625
It's probably Mom.

It is Mom.

-Let's shake a leg, guys!
-[DJ] Has anyone seen my Converse?

03:54.958 --> 03:56.583

-Kate!

04:00.250 --> 04:01.333
What are you doin' here?

04:01.416 --> 04:03.458
And more importantly,
why did we give you a key?

04:03.541 --> 04:06.708
Is that any way to greet the pinch hitter
babysitter who's here to save the day?

04:06.791 --> 04:08.458
And that's why we gave her a key.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.125
Namaste.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.166
[Paul] She dreams
about expanding her yoga studio.

-His rules, not mine, baby.
-[alarm chimes]

04:33.708 --> 04:35.916

Let's roll. Let's go. Let's go.

04:37.458 --> 04:38.458
Come on. Let's go!

04:38.541 --> 04:42.458
[Paul] Okay. Two moms, one dad,
and a ragtag group of nine kids.

04:42.541 --> 04:45.583
I know what you're thinking,
and no, we're not a cult.

04:45.666 --> 04:46.916
But we're definitely different.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.875
-No man left behind!
-Woo-hoo!

04:49.958 --> 04:51.625
-Um, what about us?
-Yeah!

04:51.708 --> 04:54.291
I'm sorry, all twins left behind.

04:54.958 --> 04:55.958
-What?
-Aw!

04:56.041 --> 04:57.166
-Hey!
-[Zoey] When we go to work,

04:57.250 --> 05:01.083
the littles stay home with Kate, because
there are limits to child labor laws.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.416
[Paul] Kate may not be
the most together babysitter,

05:03.500 --> 05:04.833
but the kids love her.

05:04.916 --> 05:06.208
And she's free.

05:06.291 --> 05:10.125
You see, we run our own family restaurant,
Baker's Breakfast.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.541
A mom and pop,

05:12.041 --> 05:14.083
and daughter, and daughter,

05:14.166 --> 05:16.125
and son, and son,

05:16.708 --> 05:18.625
and daughter breakfast spot.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.083
-Hey, Paul.
-Hey. That can go out.

05:20.166 --> 05:21.375
-Ah, cool, thanks.
-Thank you.

05:21.875 --> 05:24.291
[Paul] Okay.
First, I should explain how we got here.

05:24.875 --> 05:29.000
Kate and I met in college when we were
cast as Sandy and Danny in Grease.

05:29.083 --> 05:32.291
-[Kate shouts, laughs]
-We stayed in character onstage and off,

05:32.375 --> 05:34.750
falling in love
and having a surprise ending…

05:34.833 --> 05:36.083
-Whoa!
-[Kate screams]

05:36.166 --> 05:38.041
[Paul]
…which was getting pregnant with Ella.

05:38.125 --> 05:39.666
-[Paul groans]
-[Kate laughs]

05:39.750 --> 05:43.958
Which is why I dropped outta college
and got a job in a crummy diner.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.750
We were just getting by
when we got pregnant again…

05:47.833 --> 05:50.125
-Maybe it's supposed to be the…
-[Paul] …with Harley.

05:50.708 --> 05:54.666
And then, when our best friends
were killed by a drunk driver,

05:54.750 --> 05:57.166
we adopted our godson, Haresh.

05:57.250 --> 06:00.375
While there was nothing more exciting
than being parents,

06:00.458 --> 06:03.875
Kate got a lot less excited
about being married to me.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.833
We agreed to close that chapter
of our lives and start new ones.

06:08.416 --> 06:12.791
I dreamed big and bought
that crummy diner, which is where I met…

06:12.875 --> 06:14.750
Two short stacks
and a Denver omelet, please.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.875
Oh, and I have breakfast coupons.

06:18.166 --> 06:22.291
-Um, I'm so sorry, but it's 11:16…
-[Zoey] Wow.

06:22.375 --> 06:26.000
…which means you're gonna have to order
off this glorious lunch menu.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.250
Hi, Mommy.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.458
[Zoey] Well, kids, let's go.

06:28.541 --> 06:31.250
This unkind gentleman is trying
to force us

06:31.333 --> 06:34.541
to have hot soup and shepherd's pie
for breakfast.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.250
Why? Were we bad?

06:36.333 --> 06:38.583
Sir, please tell my adorable children

06:38.666 --> 06:42.625
why they can't have delicious eggs
and fluffy flapjacks.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.916
-Whoa.
-This is incredible.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.166
Oh, thank you so much.
It's an apple-bacon crepe.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.375
And it's amazing.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.291
-I mean, but this sauce is fantastic.
-Really?

07:00.375 --> 07:04.166
It's like, um, hot, uh, sweet, savory,
depending on what I put it on.

07:04.250 --> 07:05.916
That's exactly what I was going for.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.041
It's amazing. I mean,
you're, like, the Willy Wonka of sauces.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.000
You know, minus the unpaid, exploited
Oompa-Loompa workforce, of course.

07:12.083 --> 07:15.666
Clearly, you haven't looked in the kitchen
yet. This place runs on Loompa.

07:15.750 --> 07:16.791
[chuckles]

07:16.875 --> 07:18.291
By the way, I'm sorry about earlier.

07:18.375 --> 07:20.666
I know what it's like when kids
get their hearts set on breakfast.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.500
I got three of my own.
And breakfast is their favorite meal.

07:24.833 --> 07:28.000
By the way, that whole "we stop serving
breakfast at 11:00" thing,

07:28.083 --> 07:29.083
that has to stop.

07:29.166 --> 07:32.875
I need to be able to eat
this breakfast with that sauce 24-7.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.833
It's an interesting idea.
I'll run it by the owner.

07:34.916 --> 07:37.166
-Yeah.
-Oh, wait! That's me. I love it.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.208
[kids laugh]

07:38.291 --> 07:39.541
So good.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.958
You want some dessert, buddy?

07:41.041 --> 07:42.541
A giant cupcake.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.083
Giant cupcake it is. Be right back, Mom.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.333
[Zoey laughs]

07:46.416 --> 07:47.416
He's nice.

07:48.166 --> 07:50.666
Uh, he all right.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.125
I was newly divorced too.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.166
My ex, Dom, and I met at USC.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.250
Hello, hello.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.333
We were the perfect couple.
He was a football star,

07:57.416 --> 07:59.291
and I was a cheerleader and valedictorian.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.875
-Who you talking to?
-We got married right out of school,

08:01.958 --> 08:03.750
and Deja and DJ followed soon after.

08:03.833 --> 08:04.833
"…roller coaster."

08:04.916 --> 08:07.291
Our family grew
as fast as Dom's football career.

08:07.375 --> 08:09.833
At first, we did talk shows
and photoshoots together,

08:09.916 --> 08:14.291
but then he was always gone doing
endorsements and business ventures.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.916
And our ideas of partnership changed.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.458
So we agreed to close that chapter
of our lives and start new ones.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.041
I traded four-star restaurants
for 24-hour diners.

08:23.833 --> 08:27.375
I dusted off my marketing degree,
and we became business partners.

08:32.750 --> 08:37.041
[Paul] Six months after that,
we turned our two families into one.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.125
[applause, cheering]

08:39.208 --> 08:41.416
And we made all our dreams come true.

08:41.916 --> 08:44.500
A big, beautiful family,

08:44.583 --> 08:46.208
a booming business,

08:46.291 --> 08:48.458
-and around-the-clock breakfast.
-Can I tickle you?

08:48.541 --> 08:51.000
Even our wedding cake was made of waffles.

08:54.625 --> 08:55.625
There you go.

08:55.708 --> 08:58.041
[Paul] We turned the diner into
an all-day breakfast spot.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.958
We serve breakfast-breakfast…

09:00.750 --> 09:02.125
[Zoey] Lunch-breakfast…

09:02.208 --> 09:03.708
[Paul] And dinner-breakfast.

09:03.791 --> 09:05.750
[Zoey] My pregnancy was planned.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.833
-The outcome, however, was not.
-[groans]

09:09.666 --> 09:12.083
Twins! Luna and Luca.

09:12.166 --> 09:14.375
[Paul] Our life got a little chaotic.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.625
And just when things were settling down,

09:16.708 --> 09:20.041
it happened again with Bronx and Bailey,

09:20.125 --> 09:23.250
bringing our one big, happy family to 11.

09:23.333 --> 09:28.500
And as hectic as our life can get,
it always somehow feels just right.

09:31.208 --> 09:34.416
Babe, this is wrong.
We're not a month behind on rent, right?

09:35.916 --> 09:38.916
-Right?
-What? Us behind? That's crazy.

09:41.208 --> 09:44.541
Okay, babe, babe, babe.
You're anxiety-chopping again.

09:45.625 --> 09:46.625
Sorry.

09:48.958 --> 09:51.541
Were you intentionally hiding this
from me?

09:51.625 --> 09:54.541
It's just a month, Zoey.
I promise you it's not that big a deal.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.833
I love this place as much as you do,
but it is draining us.

09:57.916 --> 10:01.000
We can't make any moves
because we pour everything back into it.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.916
What about our dream
of buying a bigger house?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.666
It's gonna happen, baby. I promise.

10:04.750 --> 10:07.958
Even Chef Boyardee started out
as a fry cook.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.500
I just need a little more time
to figure everything out.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.833
Are you trying to tell me
Chef Boyardee is a real person?

10:12.916 --> 10:14.000
Oh, yeah.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.708
You don't know about the Boyardee?
He was a legend.

10:16.791 --> 10:21.000
He actually catered
Woodrow Wilson's wedding in 1915.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.166
He lived to 87.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.708
He died rich and happy in Ohio.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.958
It is so weird that you know this.

10:28.625 --> 10:29.666
Keep dreaming.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.083
-Can I help you find something?
-Oh, hi. Yeah.

10:43.166 --> 10:47.833
I'm looking for a sauce
that could be hot, sweet or savory

10:47.916 --> 10:50.125
depending on what you eat it with.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.750
Wow, that sounds amazing.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.291
-Right?
-Uh, what's it called?

10:54.750 --> 10:55.750
I'm not sure yet.

10:56.708 --> 10:59.375
Okay. When you figure it out, let me know.

11:01.708 --> 11:03.791
[dog barking]

11:04.541 --> 11:06.583
-Here you go.
-[hip-hop playing on headphones]

11:06.666 --> 11:08.375
-Nice and cold…
-Oh!

11:08.458 --> 11:10.916
…so you don't have to get up
and go to the kitchen,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.500
-or the hallway…
-[chuckles]

11:12.583 --> 11:15.625
…or really any other room for that matter.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.791
You are so thoughtful. Thank you, baby.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.916
[music playing over headphones]

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
You ever heard of TikTok? It's hilarious.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.833
-Hi, Danny.
-Hi, Luna.

11:27.083 --> 11:29.083
-Hey, Danny.
-Hi, Kate.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.416
What are you guys playing?

11:30.500 --> 11:32.000
Drag race.

11:32.083 --> 11:35.125
Oh, fun! I love RuPaul.

11:36.708 --> 11:37.958
[Luna] Who's betting?

11:38.041 --> 11:40.916
-[child] I've got money. I got Bailey.
-[child 2] My money's on Bronx.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.791
[children cheering]

11:42.875 --> 11:44.041
Let's get this going.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.458
This babysitter's not
gonna be checked out forever.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.833
Coast is clear! Go time.

11:49.916 --> 11:51.875
Ready? Go!

11:52.791 --> 11:54.000
-Yeah!
-Yes!

11:54.541 --> 11:55.791
[child] Go! Go! Go!

11:55.875 --> 11:57.333
Go, Bronx! Go, Bailey!

11:59.041 --> 12:00.125
Go, Danny!

12:00.208 --> 12:01.458
[Bailey] He's gaining on us!

12:01.541 --> 12:02.875
[Luca] Oh, no! Bottle!

12:02.958 --> 12:04.958
[cheering continues]

12:05.041 --> 12:06.375
[child] Go! Go!

12:06.458 --> 12:09.250
-[shushes]
-[cheering continues]

12:10.250 --> 12:11.333
Whoa.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.916
-[Danny] Shortcut!
-[Bronx] No fair!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.208
Whoa!

12:15.291 --> 12:16.958
-Come on, Bailey!
-Go get 'em!

12:20.458 --> 12:22.250
[all] Whoa.

12:22.333 --> 12:23.166
[Luca] Uh-oh.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.458
-What's wrong?
-Parents!

12:25.708 --> 12:28.083
-Everybody out!
-I'll get the door.

12:28.166 --> 12:30.625
[children scream]

12:30.708 --> 12:33.208
-What is happening? Danny?
-[DJ] Whoa.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
-[Danny] Go!
-Get lost!

12:36.083 --> 12:37.333
[children scream]

12:38.291 --> 12:39.708
-[Bailey] Yeah.
-[child laughs]

12:41.500 --> 12:42.625
[imitates bike noise]

12:42.708 --> 12:44.208
-[child] Retreat.
-[children clamoring]

12:44.291 --> 12:45.875
-[Paul] Hey! Hey!
-[Bronx] Oh!

12:45.958 --> 12:47.375
-[Zoey] Oh!
-[children] Ooh!

12:47.458 --> 12:49.625
-[Paul] Ow!
-Ooh! That's gotta hurt.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.833
I'm fine.

12:52.416 --> 12:55.500
-Did you want some ice?
-Oh, no, no, no. We're okay.

12:55.583 --> 12:58.083
Buddy, how many fingers am I holding up?

12:58.833 --> 13:00.833
-Four.
-So he's back to normal.

13:00.916 --> 13:04.416
Before you say anything,
it's not what it seems.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.500
You weren't having a Fast and Furious
style race against Danny Chen for money?

13:07.583 --> 13:10.750
Whoa. I just realized
we're not smarter than you.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.083
You guys are so irresponsible.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.916
I've been in bed the whole time.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.666
Honey, you still have your helmet on.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.416
This is my sleeping helmet.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
[littles giggle]

13:20.583 --> 13:24.208
Okay. All right. You two, out of here.
What am I gonna do with you two?

13:24.291 --> 13:26.083
[laughs]

13:26.166 --> 13:27.166
Go to your room.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.750
But don't you wanna do our TikTok dance
with us, Daddy?

13:29.833 --> 13:33.458
Yeah,
because we're so irresistibly adorable.

13:33.541 --> 13:37.041
Don't try and charm me with our TikTok
dance. And you're not even doing it right.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.541
You have to clap the back of the hands
and then throw.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.833
You're an embarrassment to the family.
Go to your room.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.708
We tried.

13:43.791 --> 13:44.791
We always do.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.250
So, uh, you think Bronx is okay?

13:51.333 --> 13:54.375
Yeah. He hits his head on the hour.

13:54.458 --> 13:58.208
Oh, good. Although,
I feel like this one is my fault.

13:58.291 --> 14:00.458
-You think?
-Well, my new therapist says

14:00.541 --> 14:02.583
I have issues with being a disciplinarian.

14:02.666 --> 14:04.375
You have another new therapist?

14:04.458 --> 14:07.250
But my new new therapist made me realize
I missed my old new therapist,

14:07.333 --> 14:09.458
so it's out with the new, in with the old.

14:09.541 --> 14:11.958
-That makes total sense.
-Yeah, I know, right?

14:12.041 --> 14:13.416
Who's that?

14:13.500 --> 14:15.666
Probably no one,
but if it's Danny Chen's parents,

14:15.750 --> 14:17.500
we don't know him, and he wasn't here.

14:19.291 --> 14:20.541
-Dom, hey.
-Hey.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.791
How are you? What are you doing in town?

14:22.875 --> 14:25.500
You know, just got back.
Thought I'd come by and see the kids.

14:25.583 --> 14:26.666
I hope that's not a problem.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.208
-Well--
-[Kate] No.

14:28.291 --> 14:30.541
You're handsome and famous?
Come over anytime.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.916
-Dad?
-Hey.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.500
[Dom chuckles]

14:35.583 --> 14:37.625
-[DJ] Oh. Hey, Dad.
-Hey, what's up, DJ?

14:37.708 --> 14:39.541
-Hey, man.
-Hey, look. These are for you.

14:39.625 --> 14:40.833
[chuckling] Oh, well, thanks.

14:40.916 --> 14:43.625
-Dom!
-Hey, little man, what's happening?

14:43.708 --> 14:45.541
-Yeah, well--
-How you doing, man? Look at you.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.583
-Looking just as stylish as ever.
-You too.

14:47.666 --> 14:48.916
Thank you, man.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.916
-So, who wants headphones?
-[Luca] Me.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.250
Beats headphones?

14:53.333 --> 14:55.583
-Personalized Beats headphones.
-Wow.

14:55.666 --> 14:57.250
You wanna help pass them out for me?

14:57.333 --> 14:58.541
-Yeah!
-[chuckles] Thanks, buddy.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.125
Thanks, Dad.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.458
-You're welcome, baby.
-Wow.

15:01.541 --> 15:03.791
Here, Daddy. Dom got you a pair too.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.666
Oh, wow. Thank you.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.250
-What is this?
-Look what Dom brought everybody.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.500
-[Zoey] Ooh. [chuckles]
-They're personalized.

15:10.583 --> 15:11.583
Whoa.

15:12.083 --> 15:15.166
-Way to stunt. Thanks, D.
-It's very nice of you, Dom. Thank you.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.500
I'm guessing I didn't-- I didn't get one?

15:18.833 --> 15:20.875
-Kate.
-Okay. Cool. Yeah. Cool.

15:20.958 --> 15:22.416
I'm gonna go check on Bronx.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.083
So, what do you think?

15:26.708 --> 15:29.958
I mean,
they're Michael Jordan tennies, and--

15:30.041 --> 15:31.458
Yeah, I guess these'll be fun.

15:31.541 --> 15:33.375
-Yeah, they're pretty dope, right?
-[DJ] Yeah.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.041
So dope. They're very dope.

15:35.125 --> 15:38.375
They look so expensive.
They probably cost more than--

15:38.458 --> 15:39.708
This house?

15:39.791 --> 15:42.041
[Dom chuckles]

15:42.125 --> 15:43.666
[chuckles] No, that's-- That-- Ow!

15:44.250 --> 15:48.041
I was-- I was actually gonna say
five pairs of my sneakers,

15:48.125 --> 15:50.875
but no, the home that I live in
is definitely funnier.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.125
They're so big.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.000
Look at these things, babe, huh?

15:55.083 --> 15:56.583
Beep. Beep. Beep.

15:56.666 --> 15:59.708
Yeah, well, actually, Paul, he's a 12 now.

15:59.791 --> 16:03.125
I don't know if you knew or not,
but, you know, big feet run in our family.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.208
And what are you?
About, what, I'd say a 10?

16:06.291 --> 16:08.500
-Dad.
-I was born with tiny toes, Dom.

16:09.208 --> 16:14.375
It's not something I like to joke about,
but since you asked, 9 and 3/4.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.083
Oh, Paul.

16:19.958 --> 16:23.125
Baby, I love your little feet, and I love
that we can share the same shoes.

16:23.208 --> 16:26.041
We don't share the same shoes.
I wore your UGGs once.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.875
Hey, Paul, you mind tossing me a beer?

16:29.666 --> 16:31.041
I'm sorry. We don't have any beer.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.625
I can clearly see that you guys have beer.

16:33.708 --> 16:35.750
-It's on-- It's on the door.
-You didn't. No.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.458
-Paul, don't be like that.
-I'll tell you what I can get for you.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.291
The one thing we have for you,

16:42.125 --> 16:43.416
a tasty juice box.

16:44.291 --> 16:47.000
Oh. Well, this is my favorite.
This is better.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.083
And, uh…

16:49.500 --> 16:51.416
interesting place to keep your oranges.

16:51.500 --> 16:55.375
Yeah, it's for convenience.
They're everywhere.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.208
You want an orange, you reach down.

16:57.958 --> 17:00.000
So, Dom, great to see you.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.208
What-- What brings you to town?
Don't you have work?

17:03.291 --> 17:06.291
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

17:06.375 --> 17:07.750
No, I decided to retire.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.166
I'm considering
a year-long deal with ESPN.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.875
Yeah, which means
more money, less tackling.

17:13.958 --> 17:16.500
So I'm just checking out places to buy.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.291
-So you're moving back to LA?
-[Dom] Mm-hmm.

17:18.375 --> 17:21.125
-That'll be great for the kids.
-LA, LA? Like, here LA?

17:21.208 --> 17:23.375
Like, where I live? With-- With my family?

17:23.458 --> 17:25.958
Yeah. To be with my family.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.416
I thought we were all family.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.500
-We are.
-We are.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.750
But that means I can be around more,

17:32.833 --> 17:35.458
be part of the day-to-day
and help out with these guys.

17:35.541 --> 17:37.083
-Cool.
-No, no. I think we're good.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.416
We don't need help. Do we, babe?
No. We're-- No.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.166
We-- We're fine.
This place runs like a well-oiled machine.

17:42.250 --> 17:45.000
Um, so he sneezed
and started bleeding again.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.791
It tastes like metal.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.708
-[Zoey] Okay, I'm coming.
-He's fine.

17:48.791 --> 17:51.166
That one's not even yours, so don't worry.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.666
Yay, Dom's moving back. More Dom.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.791
-Paul.
-I know. It'll be great with the kids.

17:57.875 --> 18:00.875
It's just-- It's definitely gonna be weird
having him around.

18:00.958 --> 18:04.000
Unlike the totally normal way
that Kate's around all the time?

18:04.791 --> 18:07.708
Babe, last week I caught her
trying on my bathing suits. Ew.

18:07.791 --> 18:10.833
-Well, at least she helps with the kids.
-And Dom will too.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.291
Now.

18:13.375 --> 18:15.958
Come on, Zoey.
You know it's not the same thing.

18:16.041 --> 18:20.291
Kate isn't richer
and, like, 10 feet taller than you.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.875
Are you ever gonna stop being threatened
by all that stuff?

18:22.958 --> 18:25.208
I am not threatened. I just-- Honestly?

18:25.291 --> 18:29.916
I think it's sad that he feels the need to
make himself feel bigger by coming in here

18:30.000 --> 18:32.958
and, like, showering us all
with these expensive headphones.

18:33.041 --> 18:36.166
Like, "We get it. You're an
ex-football player with giant feet

18:36.250 --> 18:39.000
and a Japanese toilet
that washes your butt."

18:39.083 --> 18:40.541
Not sure how you know about that.

18:40.625 --> 18:44.708
And for the record, I am very secure
in my size 9-and-1/2 Converse.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.625
Mmm. I love it when you talk
sensible sneaker to me.

18:47.708 --> 18:51.666
Well, what happens when I say Asics?

18:51.750 --> 18:52.875
[pants]

18:52.958 --> 18:54.083
Rockports.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.250
[moans]

18:56.333 --> 18:57.333
Skechers.

18:57.416 --> 18:58.666
[gasps]

18:58.750 --> 19:01.791
All right.
Now say New Balance to me real slow.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.250
New Balance.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.041
Oh, yes. [gasps]

19:13.208 --> 19:14.791
[basketball bouncing]

19:15.625 --> 19:17.125
[basketball drops through hoop]

19:23.000 --> 19:24.375
It's a little late, Dej.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.416
[sighs] I know.
I know I'm supposed to be asleep,

19:27.500 --> 19:30.166
but I heard there's gonna be a scout
from SC at my game.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.041
How bomb would it be
if I went to my dad's alma mater?

19:33.708 --> 19:35.125
Would be bombish. Bomb--

19:36.708 --> 19:38.875

-All right.
-Hey.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.416
-Oh. Okay.
-[Paul grunting]

29:54.500 --> 29:56.375
-Ooh!
-[Paul] Sorry.

29:56.458 --> 29:57.833
[Melanie] Mmm.

29:57.916 --> 29:59.166
[sighs]

30:00.500 --> 30:05.500
Hi, everyone. I am so excited
to introduce you to Paul Baker.

30:10.958 --> 30:11.958
Uh…

30:12.833 --> 30:14.458
Oh, hi, everyone. Um…

30:14.541 --> 30:18.333
Thank you-- Thank you so much
for-- for inviting me and for--

30:19.125 --> 30:22.416
Let me just-- Sorry. Bit overdressed here.

30:25.625 --> 30:26.666
[sighs]

30:33.541 --> 30:34.750
S… [clears throat]

30:35.583 --> 30:38.458
Sauce.
I'm here to talk to you about sauce.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.583
"A billion-dollar industry.

30:41.666 --> 30:44.541
Studies show that sales of sauce

30:44.625 --> 30:49.541
have skyrocketed by more
than 150% since 2000--"

30:52.791 --> 30:53.791
Is something wrong?

30:57.416 --> 30:59.666
I'm so sorry. This is-- This isn't me.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.458
I'm just gonna do this a different way.
Um…

31:05.541 --> 31:09.041
I'm just gonna speak
to you honestly about it.

31:09.125 --> 31:11.833
I-- I'm a chef,
and I have a breakfast restaurant.

31:11.916 --> 31:14.166
And I invented this sauce.

31:14.250 --> 31:18.291
And miraculously,
it is hot, sweet, and savory

31:18.375 --> 31:20.791
all at the same time,
depending on what you put it on.

31:20.875 --> 31:23.500
So you could put it on your waffles
and it would be sweet.

31:23.583 --> 31:28.875
You could put it on your… chimichangas
and it would be… you got it, savory.

31:29.750 --> 31:32.583
-[DJ] Okay, so, what's 15 times ten?
-[Haresh] Why would I know this?

31:32.666 --> 31:35.375
How did you get an F
on your computer science quiz?

31:35.458 --> 31:36.958
Like, I just don't get it.

31:37.041 --> 31:39.916
Why? 'Cause all Indian people
are supposed to be geniuses?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.500
Or all Black people can dance?

31:41.583 --> 31:43.208
-Well--
-We know that's not true.

31:43.291 --> 31:44.291
You know what?

31:44.375 --> 31:47.333
Zoey, show these idiots
what a rhythmless Black person looks like.

31:47.416 --> 31:49.375
Hey, family. I have incredible news.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.458
-Why're you wearing my sweatshirt?
-And my jeans?

31:51.541 --> 31:53.500
-And my fanny pack?
-Are those my sneakers?

31:53.583 --> 31:55.666
Yo, low-key, that outfit goes hard.

31:55.750 --> 31:56.750
Thank you, son.

31:56.833 --> 31:58.125
Look at this, my darling.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.583
What is this-- Whoa.

31:59.666 --> 32:03.000
That is the money to start
our brand new sauce company.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.166
-You sold the pitch?
-Well, no.

32:05.250 --> 32:09.375
I mean, a full half of the investors said
they had "no faith in this whatsoever,"

32:09.458 --> 32:11.666
but Melanie and Michele
think it has promise.

32:11.750 --> 32:14.166
So they gave me that check
to get things going.

32:14.250 --> 32:17.583
-Whoa, we're rich. We're rich.
-Wow! Wow.

32:17.666 --> 32:19.708
-[Paul chuckles]
-[laughs]

32:19.791 --> 32:21.875
Wait, so they gave you all of this
just for seed money?

32:21.958 --> 32:23.958
No, it's not just seed money.
It's also a signing bonus

32:24.041 --> 32:27.000
and a buyout of the company name
and all future rights to the brand, but--

32:27.083 --> 32:28.750
Cool, so we're rich and sellouts?

32:28.833 --> 32:31.833
No, we're not rich or sellouts.
This is how you grow a business.

32:31.916 --> 32:34.458
But we are the brand.

32:34.541 --> 32:38.791
The company name is literally our name,
so how does that work?

32:38.875 --> 32:41.750
If we're gonna be changing names, I want
the "S" in "Haresh" to be a dollar sign.

32:41.833 --> 32:43.833
We're not changing our names, okay?

32:43.916 --> 32:46.125
This is just gonna help us
pay off a whole lot of bills

32:46.208 --> 32:49.208
and, hopefully, get a house
with a working dryer.

32:49.291 --> 32:50.416
Yes!

32:50.500 --> 32:54.125
If Mom agrees, there are some in Calabasas
that are looking quite delicious.

32:54.208 --> 32:57.625
-What?
-Calabasas? Bieber country?

32:57.708 --> 32:59.208
Am I gonna be a Real Housewife?

32:59.291 --> 33:02.291
No, it's not Bieber-Housewives level,
but I found this gated community

33:02.375 --> 33:04.666
which has a really big house
with bedrooms for everyone.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.916
So we all get our own rooms?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.916
-Yay!
-Yay!

33:10.000 --> 33:11.541
Twins still have to share…

33:11.625 --> 33:12.666
Boo!

33:12.750 --> 33:14.208
…but there's a really amazing pool club.

33:14.291 --> 33:16.208
-Yay!
-Yay!

33:16.291 --> 33:17.458
-Yes!
-[Paul laughs]

33:17.541 --> 33:19.083
-What about school?
-That's the thing.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.458
I think we could also afford
to send you to private school.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.708
-You'd have college prep, smaller classes.
-Yo!

33:23.791 --> 33:26.125
Does it look like I'm college material?

33:26.208 --> 33:29.125
Dude, I'm fine being a disgrace.
I just don't wanna leave my friends.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.041
What about my scholarship to USC?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.958
Deja, the season just started.

33:34.041 --> 33:36.000
I think if your mom
and I decide to do this,

33:36.083 --> 33:37.666
you'll get on another great team.

33:37.750 --> 33:41.000
I don't wanna be on another team.
Another team is wack.

33:41.083 --> 33:43.291
-This whole situation is wack.
-Preach!

33:43.375 --> 33:48.250
Deja, just chill, okay?
Nothing has been decided.

33:48.958 --> 33:49.958
So--

33:50.041 --> 33:53.708
Just keep an open mind.
This could be great for our family.

34:00.208 --> 34:02.083
What about you? You think this is wack?

34:02.166 --> 34:04.000
Just please take off my fanny pack.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.625
So she locked herself in her room,
and she's not even talking to me.

34:13.708 --> 34:14.708
She'll get over it.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.416
The important thing is that you and I
are on the same page.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.083
Oh, we're not.

34:19.166 --> 34:22.125
-This is a bad idea.
-What are you talking about?

34:22.208 --> 34:23.958
You just said you thought
it could be great.

34:24.041 --> 34:26.458
Because it's important to show
the kids we're a united front.

34:26.541 --> 34:28.041
But no, this is crazy.

34:28.125 --> 34:31.041
We need to use all of that money
to launch the sauce, not buy a house too.

34:31.125 --> 34:34.375
Okay, just listen to me, baby, okay?
I've been crunching numbers,

34:34.458 --> 34:37.708
and I think with the signing bonus,
we can afford a down payment.

34:37.791 --> 34:39.083
It's too risky.

34:39.166 --> 34:42.375
If anything goes wrong, we won't be able
to afford a bigger mortgage.

34:42.458 --> 34:46.333
And seriously? Calabasas?
Is Calabasas really us?

34:46.416 --> 34:48.000
I know. It's not ideal,

34:48.083 --> 34:51.041
but it's the only place we can afford
a big enough house.

34:51.125 --> 34:53.958
We have been begging
for more room forever.

34:54.041 --> 34:55.750
You said it yourself today.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.958
True.

34:58.041 --> 34:59.041
Please trust me.

35:00.708 --> 35:03.125
I'm finally, finally in a position

35:03.208 --> 35:05.916
where I can give the kids
something they really need.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.458
And not dumb things,
like fancy headphones and flashy sneakers.

35:10.541 --> 35:14.958
I wanna give my wife a walk-in closet.

35:15.916 --> 35:18.125
Thank you. I appreciate that.

35:18.791 --> 35:22.291
But your wife already had a walk-in closet
that she walked away from.

35:24.041 --> 35:28.333
What I'm hearing is that
you want a walk-in closet.

35:30.708 --> 35:31.708
I really do.

35:32.541 --> 35:33.541
I see that.

No one has bought a house.

Come over anytime.
We've got extra pool noodles.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.000
Hello, ma'am. Welcome.

38:08.083 --> 38:09.250
Oh, thank you. Hi.

38:09.333 --> 38:12.583
Just so you know, we have
a strict neighborhood noise policy.

38:12.666 --> 38:14.500
No loud music after 10:00.

38:15.708 --> 38:16.708
Okay.

38:16.791 --> 38:19.250
Uh, question for you.

38:19.333 --> 38:23.166
Do you always immediately tell
all new homeowners about this policy?

38:23.250 --> 38:24.708
Or just us?

38:25.666 --> 38:27.083
Seconds after we arrive.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.375
Is everything okay?

38:29.458 --> 38:31.125
Yes, sir. Um…

38:32.125 --> 38:33.791
Didn't mean to cause any offense.

38:33.875 --> 38:35.958
Probably shouldn't have said
anything offensive.

My apologies, ma'am.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.833

Well, that was fun for me.

38:56.333 --> 38:59.416
It's our first night in the big place.
I thought we should celebrate.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.833
How about some Flamin' Hot Cheetos
and Cîroc?

39:02.916 --> 39:04.666

39:07.333 --> 39:08.791
French vanilla Cîroc.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.208
I thought they discontinued
French vanilla.

39:11.291 --> 39:12.875
Like that would ever stop me.

39:13.708 --> 39:15.250
Oh, this calls for lingerie.

-Cheetos!

and this is not for you.

-[Luna] This looks nice.
-Rose petals!

-How could both of your tummies hurt?

-[Luca] Come on! Come in!
-No, we're not all staying in here--

[Bronx] Rose petals!

39:48.000 --> 39:49.083
Oh, hey, guys.

39:49.166 --> 39:50.625
-Come on. It's your man.
-Hey, DJ!

39:50.708 --> 39:51.625
Just gonna take this.

39:51.708 --> 39:53.500
-You came just in time to leave.
-Rose petals! Rose!

39:53.583 --> 39:54.583
-Thank you.
-Anyways,

39:54.666 --> 39:56.125
I'm gonna need the wireless password,

39:56.208 --> 39:59.500
but not so I can search for college girls
being free with their bodies.

39:59.583 --> 40:01.541
No, that's why I didn't give you
the Wi-Fi password.

And yes, I am a child.

53:34.041 --> 53:35.583
What's going on?

53:35.666 --> 53:37.583
So, we've been doing some research,

53:37.666 --> 53:40.083
and we're seeing
that in the past few months,

53:40.166 --> 53:42.500
your sauce has been flying
off the shelves.

53:42.583 --> 53:44.291
Sales have doubled in the past week alone.

53:44.375 --> 53:45.916
-Doubled.
-Yeah, we've been doing okay.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.333
[Michele] No, it's more than okay.

53:47.416 --> 53:50.083
We're thinking what you could do
with some real money behind you.

53:50.166 --> 53:52.291
So, what exactly are you proposing?

53:52.375 --> 53:54.583
We're proposing an expansion.

53:54.666 --> 53:57.666
We wanna take your restaurant
and make it bigger than IHOP.

53:57.750 --> 54:00.666
We wanna turn Baker's into a franchise.

54:00.750 --> 54:03.041
Oh, wow.

54:03.625 --> 54:05.541
Wow.

What do you think?

54:17.916 --> 54:21.458
I think the idea sounds very exciting.

54:21.541 --> 54:23.875
I'm not sure why we need to do it though.

54:23.958 --> 54:26.375
I mean, the sauce is doing so well,
we bought the house--

54:26.458 --> 54:27.875
But this is just the beginning.

54:27.958 --> 54:30.208
This could be everything
we've ever dreamt of.

54:30.291 --> 54:31.500
I don't know.

54:31.583 --> 54:33.041
-Bye. Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

54:33.125 --> 54:35.250
What do we even know
about starting a franchise?

54:35.333 --> 54:37.500
Nothing. But what did I know
about starting a restaurant?

54:37.583 --> 54:40.583
This is different.
I mean, it would be a huge change.

54:40.666 --> 54:42.291
-Change is good.
-Is it?

54:42.375 --> 54:43.791
-Hi, welcome to Baker's.
-[both] Hey.

54:44.625 --> 54:48.458
When Dom got drafted to the league,
he promised me that nothing would change.

54:48.541 --> 54:51.875
But it did. I mean, I knew
he would be on the road a lot.

54:51.958 --> 54:54.208
But then he started saying "yes"
to everything.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.541
And then, between the endorsements,
and the appearances,

54:56.625 --> 54:57.958
it was like he was never home.

54:58.041 --> 55:00.250
And when he was home,
he was too tired to be present.

55:00.333 --> 55:01.875
Look, I know I can make this work.

55:02.541 --> 55:04.708
But I won't do it
without your full support.

means everything to me.

Um, the best way to get in good
with a girl, I think,

58:14.958 --> 58:17.041
is to find out what she likes

58:17.125 --> 58:20.875
and kind of use that as an icebreaker
to get your foot in the door.

58:20.958 --> 58:22.416
Yeah, that makes sense.

I'm just saying we can afford
a little help now if you need it.

1:00:29.958 --> 1:00:32.166
-Go. I'm fine.
-Okay. Have fun. I love you.

1:00:32.250 --> 1:00:33.416
-I love you.
-Bye.

1:00:34.583 --> 1:00:36.083
-Morning, sir.
-Good morning.

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:38.250
-[both laughing]
-Got you.

1:00:38.333 --> 1:00:40.500
Oh, whoa. Where do you two think
you're going with those?

1:00:40.583 --> 1:00:43.666
-You said we had a playdate.
-You can't bring those to our playdate.

1:00:43.750 --> 1:00:45.541
But they're just toys.

1:00:45.625 --> 1:00:50.125
That you convinced us to buy,
then taught us how to shoot.

1:00:50.208 --> 1:00:55.541
Yes, admittedly, they are hours of fun,
but those are only for inside the house.

1:00:55.625 --> 1:00:59.208
Okay? Never outside.
All right? It's not safe.

1:01:00.416 --> 1:01:02.083
But chin up.

1:01:02.166 --> 1:01:05.166
Because there's so many other fun things
to do over there. I promise.

1:01:05.250 --> 1:01:07.541
-[child 1] Die! Die!
-[child 2] I got you!

1:01:07.625 --> 1:01:10.000
Guys,
there's so many other fun ways to play.

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:12.791
Please, just let us feel our feelings.

1:01:12.875 --> 1:01:13.875
[Bronx] Yeah.

1:01:14.958 --> 1:01:17.541
-[child laughing]
-Okay. Okay.

1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.041
["Sunflower" playing]

1:01:21.125 --> 1:01:23.500
-Oh, my kids are so over me.
-Mmm.

1:01:24.291 --> 1:01:26.208
Oh. Mine were never into me.

1:01:27.833 --> 1:01:29.958
-Hi, Anne.
-Hi, Trish.

1:01:31.083 --> 1:01:33.083
Oh, wow.

1:01:33.166 --> 1:01:35.375
Oh, those kids are so cute.

1:01:35.458 --> 1:01:36.750
Oh, thank you.

1:01:36.833 --> 1:01:38.750
And how long have you been the nanny for?

1:01:39.333 --> 1:01:42.833
Anne… [clears throat]
…this is Zoey. [chuckles]

1:01:42.916 --> 1:01:44.500
She's the new mom in the group.

1:01:44.583 --> 1:01:45.750
-Oh…
-Surprise!

1:01:46.750 --> 1:01:48.916
[sighs] Oh, I did it again.

1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.250
Oh, "again."

1:01:50.333 --> 1:01:52.583
I am so sorry. Oh, my goodness.

1:01:52.666 --> 1:01:57.083
I had absolutely no idea.
Never seen you in any of the mom groups.

1:01:57.166 --> 1:02:00.791
No, it's-- it's fine. It's fine.
You know what? It's an honest mistake.

1:02:00.875 --> 1:02:03.083
Well, I'm Anne Vaughn. Hi, Zo.

1:02:03.625 --> 1:02:04.625
"Ey." Yep.

1:02:04.708 --> 1:02:07.833
Nice to meet you. And I also adopted.

1:02:09.458 --> 1:02:11.541
Those are my children. Ming and Kenny.

1:02:13.083 --> 1:02:14.583
Okay. Okay.

1:02:15.666 --> 1:02:17.833
Well, I am Zoey.

1:02:17.916 --> 1:02:23.125
And those are my biracial children, uh,
Bronx and Bailey,

1:02:23.208 --> 1:02:25.750
-that I conceived with my husband…
-[Tricia chuckles]

1:02:25.833 --> 1:02:30.416
…and then I birthed them
through my very own personal uterus.

1:02:31.208 --> 1:02:33.500
Okay, I could use some wine, Trish.

1:02:33.583 --> 1:02:34.833
[Anne laughs]

1:02:34.916 --> 1:02:38.375
-Listen, I don't wanna make this awkward…
-[Tricia] Yeah, we all could.

1:02:38.458 --> 1:02:40.166
…but it's just so frustrating.

1:02:40.250 --> 1:02:42.958
People have so many preconceived notions
about my kids.

1:02:43.041 --> 1:02:46.791
That, like, they're not mine
or there's too many of them…

1:02:46.875 --> 1:02:48.625
-[dog barking]
-…or they're too wild!

1:02:48.708 --> 1:02:51.458
-[Bark Obama barking]
-[Baker children] Mom! Mom!

1:02:51.541 --> 1:02:53.750
Was that a stray rottweiler
running down the bike path?

1:02:53.833 --> 1:02:55.458
[chattering, shouting]

1:02:55.541 --> 1:02:57.875
What is going on? Whose kids are those?

1:02:57.958 --> 1:03:00.666
Uh… [stammers]
Look at the time. It's wine o' clock.

1:03:01.375 --> 1:03:03.791
Wait! [groaning]

1:03:03.875 --> 1:03:06.583
Y'all know these espadrilles
weren't made for running!

1:03:06.666 --> 1:03:07.666
Come on!

1:03:17.833 --> 1:03:19.791
Hi, I'm Chef Baker.

1:03:22.208 --> 1:03:24.166
[crowd cheering, clapping]

1:03:25.125 --> 1:03:27.125
[spectator 1] Let's go, Hornets!

1:03:27.208 --> 1:03:28.625
[spectator 2] Come on, defense!

1:03:31.166 --> 1:03:32.916
-[crowd cheering]
-[whistle blows]

1:03:34.083 --> 1:03:35.916
Mommy, when's Deja gonna play?

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.333
I don't know, sweetie.

1:03:41.333 --> 1:03:44.333
-Hey, what's up, guys?
-[littles] Chris! Chris! Chris!

1:03:45.666 --> 1:03:47.500
-Hey, Mrs. Baker.
-How you doing?

1:03:47.583 --> 1:03:50.166
Mr. Clayton. Wow.
You're here cheering on Deja too?

1:03:50.916 --> 1:03:52.541
-Sure are.
-Nice to meet you.

1:03:54.208 --> 1:03:55.208
"Too"?

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:57.166
Who the hell is that?

1:03:57.250 --> 1:03:59.541
Well, I mean,
it's definitely not Deja's boyfriend

1:03:59.625 --> 1:04:01.500
who we're not supposed
to be telling you about.

1:04:06.250 --> 1:04:08.125
-[crowd cheering]
-[buzzer sounds]

1:04:08.875 --> 1:04:10.041
Dom, he's putting her in.

1:04:10.125 --> 1:04:11.583
Hey! Here we go, Deja!

1:04:11.666 --> 1:04:13.958
Come on, baby! Come on, Dej!

1:04:14.541 --> 1:04:16.125
Not you, Clayton. Baron, you're in.

1:04:17.666 --> 1:04:18.666
I'm sorry.

1:04:21.083 --> 1:04:22.208
What?

1:04:22.291 --> 1:04:26.083
Baron? Look, I've seen her in practice,
and she's a garbage player.

1:04:27.041 --> 1:04:29.416
I mean, who would pick a Baron
when you got a Clayton?

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:37.041
Well, I hope USC gives out scholarships
for riding the bench.

1:04:41.375 --> 1:04:43.416
Whoa. Whoa. Where you guys going?

1:04:43.500 --> 1:04:44.791
We're scared.

1:04:44.875 --> 1:04:46.708
There's a monster under our bed.

1:04:47.291 --> 1:04:49.000
Have you tried monster spray?

1:04:49.083 --> 1:04:50.750
What's monster spray?

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:53.250
-You've never heard of monster spray?
-No.

1:04:53.333 --> 1:04:56.291
It works every time. Come on.
I'll show you how to make it.

1:04:56.375 --> 1:05:00.583
Does it make their eyes pop out
and blood spurt everywhere?

1:05:02.833 --> 1:05:05.375
Sure. Blood. Guts. Everything.

1:05:05.458 --> 1:05:06.583
[both] Cool.

1:05:10.750 --> 1:05:12.791
Hey! How's Deja doing?

1:05:14.041 --> 1:05:16.500
You know, ego's a little bruised,
but she'll live.

1:05:16.583 --> 1:05:18.166
Why won't she talk to me?

1:05:19.291 --> 1:05:22.416
Because she's a moody teenage girl
and you're her annoying mom.

1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:25.250
Mom is the one who bandages her boo-boos

1:05:25.333 --> 1:05:27.041
and was in the trenches with her
every day.

1:05:27.125 --> 1:05:28.958
Yeah, but Mom's not the athlete.

1:05:29.041 --> 1:05:32.375
Mom doesn't know what it's like to put
her blood, sweat and tears onto the court,

1:05:32.458 --> 1:05:35.083
and walk away with nothing
but aching muscles and a broken heart.

1:05:35.166 --> 1:05:36.791
Let Daddy have this one.

1:05:41.041 --> 1:05:42.041
Okay.

1:05:42.583 --> 1:05:46.791
Oh, and you don't have to call yourself
"Daddy" when there's no kids around.

1:05:46.875 --> 1:05:48.000
Oh.

1:05:48.083 --> 1:05:50.125
Got it. Got it. Daddy hears that.

1:05:53.583 --> 1:05:55.375
So, what do you think?

1:05:55.458 --> 1:05:57.333
I mean, I guess it could work,

1:05:57.416 --> 1:06:01.875
but only if we take what's here
and, like, rip it all out and burn it.

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.625
-Sounds like we should keep looking.
-Yeah.

1:06:05.166 --> 1:06:07.125
In the meantime, let's talk menus.

1:06:07.208 --> 1:06:10.375
Yes! By the way, Zoey made a list
of all these local vendors.

1:06:10.458 --> 1:06:11.791
-Local?
-Yeah.

1:06:11.875 --> 1:06:15.333
The customers love it and it's awesome
for the organic farm community.

1:06:15.416 --> 1:06:17.250
Look, we love organic farmers.

1:06:17.333 --> 1:06:19.166
-They're a fun bunch.
-Yeah, so fun!

1:06:19.250 --> 1:06:21.791
But we like to use larger wholesalers
to cut costs.

1:06:21.875 --> 1:06:23.083
So many costs.

1:06:23.791 --> 1:06:27.125
-Wait, really?
-But, with that said, let's get into it.

1:06:27.208 --> 1:06:29.416
Yeah!
If it makes sense, we'll totally do it.

1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:32.083
Okay, great. Should we get out of here?

1:06:32.166 --> 1:06:33.708
-[Michele] Yeah!
-Smells like sadness.

1:06:33.791 --> 1:06:35.708
-Okay. We got you.
-And mouse poop.

1:06:36.541 --> 1:06:41.791
Zo, I still can't believe
you have ten kids and no nanny.

1:06:41.875 --> 1:06:45.041
Wait. You have ten kids? Consensually?

1:06:45.125 --> 1:06:47.541
Well, technically, they're not all mine.

1:06:47.625 --> 1:06:50.333
You know,
three are from Paul's first marriage.

1:06:50.416 --> 1:06:53.916
And then we took in our nephew
who was getting into some bad stuff.

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.166
You know, fighting, and gangs and…

1:06:56.250 --> 1:06:58.250
Oh, no. That's awful.

1:06:58.333 --> 1:07:03.666
And you're bringing him here to this safe,
equity-growing, gated community.

1:07:03.750 --> 1:07:05.458
I mean, it's so thoughtful of you.

1:07:05.958 --> 1:07:08.250
You and Paul should come over
for dinner sometime.

1:07:08.333 --> 1:07:11.000
Oh, gosh. That would be great.
You know, whenever he gets back.

1:07:11.083 --> 1:07:14.083
Ever since this whole franchise thing
started, he's always gone.

1:07:14.166 --> 1:07:17.375
Right now, he's up in San Francisco
looking for potential restaurant venues.

1:07:17.458 --> 1:07:18.791
That's how it always goes.

1:07:18.875 --> 1:07:21.333
Dad's jet-setting away
while Mom's stuck at home with the kids.

1:07:21.416 --> 1:07:23.833
Yes. Ugh. I agree.

1:07:23.916 --> 1:07:25.666
Shockingly, I enjoy being with my kids.

1:07:25.750 --> 1:07:27.541
-I do too.
-I do too. Yeah.

1:07:27.625 --> 1:07:29.500
That's hilarious. "I do too."

1:07:31.250 --> 1:07:32.500
You guys are funny.

1:07:34.250 --> 1:07:36.333
Hello? Anybody home?

1:07:36.958 --> 1:07:38.333
Daddy!

1:07:38.416 --> 1:07:39.708
What'd you bring us?

1:07:39.791 --> 1:07:43.375
Bring you? I thought me arriving home
safely was your present?

1:07:43.458 --> 1:07:44.916
-[both] Boo!
-[Paul] Boo?

1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.291
Boo, you guys! Oh, no!
Wait, I forgot all the presents.

1:07:48.375 --> 1:07:50.583
I don't know why you guys think
I got you something.

1:07:50.666 --> 1:07:52.291
I don't know what's in here.

1:07:54.083 --> 1:07:56.708
Who put this in here? A Warriors jersey!

1:07:56.791 --> 1:07:58.000
Thanks, Paul!

1:07:58.083 --> 1:07:59.958
-Golden Gate Legos.
-Yo! Yo, thanks.

1:08:00.541 --> 1:08:01.541
Alcatraz hat.

1:08:01.625 --> 1:08:02.833
Sick, thanks!

1:08:02.916 --> 1:08:04.250
Tupac sweatshirt.

1:08:04.333 --> 1:08:05.333
What's up?

1:08:05.416 --> 1:08:07.375
I wonder who this is for? iPhone case.

1:08:07.458 --> 1:08:09.166
-[Ella] Thank you!
-49ers socks.

1:08:09.250 --> 1:08:10.833
-Did we get anything?
-Cool.

1:08:10.916 --> 1:08:12.500
Like a hat or something else?

1:08:12.583 --> 1:08:15.750
Oh, no. What happened?
All that's left are my clothes.

1:08:15.833 --> 1:08:17.375
I'm so sorry, guys.

1:08:17.458 --> 1:08:19.416
-But we're your best children.
-Yeah.

1:08:19.500 --> 1:08:21.083
You're right. You are my best children.

1:08:21.166 --> 1:08:25.041
Let me see what-- [gasps]
Hotel chocolates and soap!

1:08:25.125 --> 1:08:26.750
[all] Yay!

1:08:26.833 --> 1:08:27.958
Candy!

1:08:28.041 --> 1:08:29.916
Soap!

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.250
-Thank you, Daddy! Thank you!
-Thanks, Dad!

1:08:32.875 --> 1:08:33.875
They love soap.

1:08:33.958 --> 1:08:35.458
I don't know why. They don't use it.

1:08:37.375 --> 1:08:38.791
Well played, Mr. Baker.

1:08:39.333 --> 1:08:44.583
And of course, I couldn't come home
without a souvenir for Mommy.

1:08:45.166 --> 1:08:46.166
What?

1:08:47.125 --> 1:08:48.125
Babe.

1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:52.500
It's beautiful.

1:08:55.125 --> 1:08:57.083
Baby, you didn't have to do this.
I love my ring.

1:08:57.166 --> 1:08:59.125
I know, but I've been wanting
to do this forever,

1:08:59.208 --> 1:09:01.125
and I'm finally in a position
where I could.

1:09:01.916 --> 1:09:04.125
That's the ring I should have bought you
ten years ago.

1:09:05.291 --> 1:09:06.875
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1:09:06.958 --> 1:09:12.625
Well, out with the old
and in with the bling.

1:09:12.708 --> 1:09:15.083
-[Paul laughing]
-Whoa!

1:09:15.166 --> 1:09:17.208
-You like it?
-I love it.

1:09:21.666 --> 1:09:22.666
[knocks]

1:09:22.750 --> 1:09:24.250
-[Seth] Hey, man.
-Yo.

1:09:24.333 --> 1:09:25.333
I got you something.

1:09:27.625 --> 1:09:28.625
Dude, what's this?

1:09:29.208 --> 1:09:32.000
So you can get rid of those busted kicks
you keep getting clowned for.

1:09:32.083 --> 1:09:34.958
Ah. Nah, dog.
You-- You got it all wrong. Okay?

1:09:35.041 --> 1:09:38.125
Like, me and my boys at school,
we just go back and forth like that. I--

1:09:38.208 --> 1:09:39.458
Stop. No, seriously.

1:09:40.208 --> 1:09:42.375
You're making this uncomfortable
for both of us.

1:09:42.458 --> 1:09:45.583
Now, I've seen what's been going on
at school, and I've been there.

1:09:45.666 --> 1:09:47.416
I used to get clowned all the time.

1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:49.458
Shut up. You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

1:09:49.541 --> 1:09:51.583
All right, dude. D-Dude. I'm serious.

1:09:52.333 --> 1:09:53.500
You know, look at me.

1:09:54.083 --> 1:09:56.833
I've always been the weirdo
with the messed-up mom and no dad.

1:10:01.250 --> 1:10:02.250
Open them.

1:10:07.916 --> 1:10:09.708
[gasps] Yo!

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:14.500
Dude, these-- These kicks are dope.

1:10:14.583 --> 1:10:18.000
All right, but I can't take these.
Where'd you even get the money from?

1:10:18.083 --> 1:10:19.500
Don't worry about it.

1:10:19.583 --> 1:10:22.375
You know, all you need to do
is keep those jerks off your back.

1:10:22.458 --> 1:10:23.458
I'm gonna help you.

1:10:23.541 --> 1:10:25.375
I'll teach you how to defend yourself.

1:10:25.458 --> 1:10:26.458
Let's do this.

1:10:29.250 --> 1:10:30.583
Hey, guess what.

1:10:30.666 --> 1:10:33.583
Melanie and Michele wanna fly me back up
to look at restaurant spaces

1:10:33.666 --> 1:10:34.666
over the next few days.

1:10:34.750 --> 1:10:37.000
-Again? You were just there.
-I know, I'm surprised too.

1:10:37.083 --> 1:10:38.916
They said it's important
to nail it all down now.

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.875
I thought we were all gonna talk
about it on the call tomorrow.

1:10:40.958 --> 1:10:43.375
Yeah, I guess they have, like,
a bunch of meetings tomorrow.

1:10:43.458 --> 1:10:45.458
So we just kinda ended up
talking about it now.

1:10:45.541 --> 1:10:48.666
-Wait. Why didn't you come get me?
-Because you were giving the twins a bath.

1:10:48.750 --> 1:10:51.125
And you didn't say you had to wait for me?

1:10:51.208 --> 1:10:53.333
Well, they just started talking,
and it was exciting and--

1:10:53.416 --> 1:10:55.666
Babe, can I at least show you
what we talked about?

1:10:55.750 --> 1:10:56.916
It's really exciting.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.833
Look. Look at this.
Wait. Wait for it. Look at that.

1:11:01.708 --> 1:11:02.708
-Whoa.
-Right?

1:11:02.791 --> 1:11:04.958
-Look at this.
-That's beautiful.

1:11:05.041 --> 1:11:07.583
We could put a huge chalkboard right here.

1:11:07.666 --> 1:11:11.125
A-And do a list of all the local vendors
and their farms.

1:11:11.208 --> 1:11:13.041
About the local vendors,

1:11:13.125 --> 1:11:16.000
they say that it's gonna be too expensive
now that we're expanding.

1:11:16.083 --> 1:11:20.083
Those personal touches are what makes
Baker's Breakfast, Baker's Breakfast.

1:11:20.166 --> 1:11:22.916
And then the name is another thing too.

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.541
I guess there's already a franchise that's
Baker's Breakfast Buffet or something,

1:11:28.625 --> 1:11:31.750
and they're really worried
that our branding will get confused.

1:11:31.833 --> 1:11:34.416
-So, we're changing our name too?
-But they said don't worry.

1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:36.958
They're gonna put, like,
a huge marketing team behind it.

1:11:37.041 --> 1:11:38.333
Wait. Wait. Why? Why?

1:11:38.416 --> 1:11:40.416
Didn't you tell them
I have a degree in marketing?

1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:42.125
I mean,
I came up with "Baker's Breakfast."

1:11:42.208 --> 1:11:44.166
Yeah, but, babe,
it wasn't that revolutionary.

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:45.791
It's just my name and what I serve.

1:11:53.916 --> 1:11:56.625
So, last I checked,
it was our name and what we serve.

1:11:56.708 --> 1:11:58.708
I didn't mean it like that.
I just mean that, you know--

1:11:58.791 --> 1:12:00.625
I'm the face of the company. I'm the chef.

1:12:00.708 --> 1:12:02.416
Look, I barely know the Malibu Barbies,

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:05.166
and I get that they
don't value my opinion,

1:12:05.250 --> 1:12:08.958
but I can't believe that you're trying
to edge me out too.

1:12:09.041 --> 1:12:12.083
I am not trying to edge you out, baby.
Come on. I promise.

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:14.750
I barely know them. I just--
I don't wanna create any obstacles.

1:12:14.833 --> 1:12:17.541
Oh, so now I'm an obstacle. Right.

1:12:17.625 --> 1:12:22.750
Come on. I didn't mean it like that.
Look, Zoey, this is my dream.

1:12:24.541 --> 1:12:28.750
Right. Your dream. And I'm dreamless.

1:12:30.125 --> 1:12:31.375

1:12:32.416 --> 1:12:33.416

-Yo!
-Oh! Geez.

1:12:49.291 --> 1:12:52.541
Could my kids stay at my house?
Would that help while he's gone?

1:12:52.625 --> 1:12:55.875
-Um, thank you for that offer, but no.
-Mm-hmm.

1:12:55.958 --> 1:12:58.875
All the twins love
to have them here, so no.

1:12:58.958 --> 1:13:00.291
-We're good.
-Mm-hmm.

I got a call about my son, Haresh Baker.

1:14:57.041 --> 1:14:59.333
Oh, I didn't know Haresh had two moms.

1:14:59.416 --> 1:15:00.958
-Yes.
-Uh-huh.

Oh, no. No. We're not together.

Thank you for coming in.

1:15:11.208 --> 1:15:13.875
-Oh, no. No problem. Where's Haresh?
-What happened?

1:15:14.458 --> 1:15:17.458
Yo, Trent! I stand against bullying!

1:15:18.583 --> 1:15:19.583
-What are you--
-Racist trash,

I'll kill you and your nana!

Get off me, dude! Get off me!

Chill out, bro. I'm warning you.
You mess with him, you mess with me.

1:15:26.250 --> 1:15:28.583
Yeah. And if you mess with him,
you mess with me. Whoa!

1:15:29.541 --> 1:15:31.750
You're saying Haresh attacked
the other boy?

Because you're grounded,

Come on. It's not Haresh's fault.

We're no longer boarding.

Oh, no, no. Please, please.
It's my son's birthday party.

1:19:11.708 --> 1:19:14.208
I gotta make it home.
Look how sweet he is.

1:19:16.750 --> 1:19:19.958
Aw. A Black son. By all means.

1:19:20.750 --> 1:19:22.708
Please extend the jetway.

1:19:23.291 --> 1:19:25.500
-Really?
-No, I am not extending the jetway.

1:19:26.291 --> 1:19:27.291
Well, uh…

1:19:28.083 --> 1:19:30.833
Look, um, I make the most amazing sauce.

1:19:30.916 --> 1:19:34.000
It's hot, sweet, and savory,
and I promise you,

1:19:34.083 --> 1:19:38.500
I will provide you with a lifetime supply
if you let me get on this flight.

1:19:39.125 --> 1:19:40.125
What do you say?

1:19:46.166 --> 1:19:48.166
Sir. Sir!

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:52.875
So it's hot, sweet or savory
depending on what you put it on.

1:19:52.958 --> 1:19:55.458
Damn racist talking about,
"Do you want some hot sauce?"

1:19:55.541 --> 1:19:58.666

Still don't mean you should ask.

Hi. This party is adorable.

It's so throwback that you don't have
any celebrity performers.

1:20:28.083 --> 1:20:29.375
It's like when we were kids,

1:20:29.458 --> 1:20:31.791
and our parents just could not
be bothered with us.

Anyways, you guys. This is very upsetting.

1:20:37.458 --> 1:20:41.500
There've been a series of break-ins
in the neighborhood.

-That's awful.
-Terrible.

1:20:44.125 --> 1:20:47.291
Oh, and this is for the birthday boy.

1:20:47.375 --> 1:20:50.333
And I'd love to meet your family.
Where is your nephew?

1:20:51.083 --> 1:20:52.666
Wait. Why do you ask?

1:20:53.333 --> 1:20:54.333
I was just curious.

1:20:54.416 --> 1:20:57.083
And also, just out of total curiosity,

1:20:57.166 --> 1:21:01.208
do you know
where he was last night at 9:32?

1:21:01.291 --> 1:21:03.041

1:21:03.125 --> 1:21:06.041

to do with these break-ins?

No. No.

1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:11.791
I just--

1:21:11.875 --> 1:21:12.875
I mean, you said yourself

1:21:12.958 --> 1:21:15.541
that he had gotten into a lot of trouble
before he came here.

1:21:15.625 --> 1:21:18.000
Yeah,
that doesn't make him a criminal, Anne.

that my family is honorable, all right?

straight home, because you're grounded.

-No more Chris.

-Yes, I can. Can I do that?

and left us here to deal with it.

Why are you just telling me this now?

1:26:22.375 --> 1:26:26.458
Well, babe,
because I was proud and so excited

1:26:26.541 --> 1:26:28.750
watching you go big with your sauce.

1:26:28.833 --> 1:26:32.833
And I-- I just went along with
all the other bigger and better stuff too.

1:26:33.333 --> 1:26:36.208
Of course, I-- I wanna give our kids more.

1:26:36.291 --> 1:26:38.791
Let's just do it our way
like we always have.

1:26:43.625 --> 1:26:44.625
Wow.

1:26:46.708 --> 1:26:50.583
I've been gone so much I really had
no idea everyone was this unhappy.

1:26:51.375 --> 1:26:52.750
I don't know. I guess, I just--

1:26:53.333 --> 1:26:58.083
I was trying to prove to you that I could
give everybody everything they wanted.

1:26:58.166 --> 1:27:00.458
I don't know.
I got carried away by those Barbies,

1:27:00.541 --> 1:27:02.666
and they almost convinced me
to make lunch.

1:27:02.750 --> 1:27:03.875

1:27:03.958 --> 1:27:04.958
[laughs]

1:27:06.333 --> 1:27:08.416
But you're right. I can feel it.
This isn't us.

1:27:08.500 --> 1:27:10.750
This McMansion and the private schools
and that ring.

1:27:10.833 --> 1:27:12.125
Whoa, whoa. [stammers]

I'm not leaving them here?

1:27:31.666 --> 1:27:34.750
Doesn't sound like I'm going to get
any argument from Deja.

1:27:34.833 --> 1:27:37.458
-You know, she hates it here.
-Deja's a teenager, Dom.

1:27:37.541 --> 1:27:39.458
She hates everything
that doesn't go her way.

1:27:40.083 --> 1:27:43.625
And I think DJ made it very clear
that he does not wanna go with you.

1:27:43.708 --> 1:27:44.708
Well,

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:47.916
DJ doesn't know what's good for him.

1:27:49.666 --> 1:27:52.083
You do realize they're my children, right?

1:27:52.166 --> 1:27:54.875
Of course, I do, but with all due respect,
they're my family too.

1:27:54.958 --> 1:27:56.625
Just because we don't have the same blood

1:27:56.708 --> 1:27:59.541
-or skin color doesn't mean that--
-Okay. No. Stop. Stop.

1:28:01.250 --> 1:28:03.291
Please, don't dismiss that

1:28:03.375 --> 1:28:07.166
like we're talking about sharing
the same birthday or taste in music,

1:28:07.250 --> 1:28:08.250
because we are not.

1:28:09.875 --> 1:28:11.625
We're talking about an experience that--

1:28:11.708 --> 1:28:12.875
[sighs]

1:28:12.958 --> 1:28:14.250
That you'll never understand.

1:28:14.333 --> 1:28:16.625
You do realize
that I have Black children too, right?

1:28:16.708 --> 1:28:18.666
Listen, man,
just because you married a Black woman

1:28:18.750 --> 1:28:21.208
and had babies with a Black woman,
does not mean that you know

1:28:21.291 --> 1:28:23.833
how to handle everything
that's about to be thrown at them.

1:28:24.708 --> 1:28:28.125
You have no idea what DJ's gonna
have to go through in a couple of years.

1:28:28.208 --> 1:28:30.083
I see what you put him through now.

1:28:30.166 --> 1:28:32.250
You can't accept the fact
he's this sweet, goofy nerd

1:28:32.333 --> 1:28:33.833
who wants to play Dungeons & Dragons.

1:28:33.916 --> 1:28:36.875
Yeah! Yeah, that's how we see him.

1:28:37.750 --> 1:28:41.208
But, Paul, he's about to become a man

1:28:42.250 --> 1:28:44.916
who's gonna be seen as a threat
in this racist world

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.208
no matter what he does.

1:28:46.791 --> 1:28:48.958
Do you honestly think
that I don't understand that?

1:28:49.041 --> 1:28:51.916
Listen, Paul. Bro…

1:28:53.666 --> 1:28:56.166
I went from a little, skinny kid
in the Wild 100s

1:28:56.250 --> 1:28:59.333
on the South Side of Chicago
to a three-time MVP.

1:28:59.416 --> 1:29:02.541
And I still get pulled over
in every city I live in.

1:29:05.083 --> 1:29:07.125
[stammers] You can't prepare him for that.

1:29:07.791 --> 1:29:10.875
Because you have no idea what that's like.
How it feels.

1:29:11.708 --> 1:29:13.333
How terrifying it is.

1:29:14.875 --> 1:29:15.875
Every time.

1:29:18.625 --> 1:29:19.625
[sighs]

1:29:20.125 --> 1:29:23.125
You're right. You're absolutely right.
I have never experienced that,

1:29:23.208 --> 1:29:24.291
and I never will.

1:29:26.708 --> 1:29:29.291
And I respect everything you're saying.

1:29:31.583 --> 1:29:33.041
But one thing I do have.

1:29:34.083 --> 1:29:38.041
I have an incredible bond
with both of your kids,

1:29:39.458 --> 1:29:41.916
because I'm here, boots-on-the-ground.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:43.500
And I love them.

1:29:43.583 --> 1:29:45.000
And they love me.

1:29:46.208 --> 1:29:48.875
And I am doing
absolutely everything I can.

1:29:48.958 --> 1:29:50.875
And I'm saying that's not good enough.

1:29:57.500 --> 1:29:58.500
Night, guys.

1:29:58.583 --> 1:30:00.791
Before you go in,
there's something we need to tell you.

1:30:00.875 --> 1:30:04.041
-What'd you do? Where's my money?
-Yo, what are you talking about?

1:30:04.125 --> 1:30:06.083
Save the act, Seth.
We know you're a thief.

1:30:06.166 --> 1:30:09.166
Harley heard the Real Housewives
of Calabasas talking about some break-ins,

1:30:09.250 --> 1:30:11.166
and we knew it was you. So, busted.

1:30:11.250 --> 1:30:14.500
Okay, just because you don't like him,
doesn't make him guilty. It's not that--

1:30:14.583 --> 1:30:16.875
No, but the fact
that he had five hundos in there does.

1:30:16.958 --> 1:30:19.875
And didn't you say
he bought you a $200 pair of sneakers?

1:30:19.958 --> 1:30:20.833
Well, yes--

1:30:20.916 --> 1:30:23.375
You told us you saw him stealing
from the cash register, didn't you?

1:30:25.541 --> 1:30:28.208
You know, I'm so stupid.
How did I think you people cared about me?

1:30:28.291 --> 1:30:29.416
Seth, please, it's--

1:30:29.500 --> 1:30:31.250
-Please, I--
-I put it back, by the way.

1:30:31.333 --> 1:30:32.666
Not that you people care.

1:30:35.500 --> 1:30:36.583
Good job.

1:30:36.666 --> 1:30:37.666
Wait, Haresh.

1:30:38.833 --> 1:30:41.000
-I'm out of here.
-What's the matter?

1:30:41.083 --> 1:30:42.750
I don't know what you're trying to prove,

1:30:42.833 --> 1:30:44.875
but stop trying to pretend
I'm part of your family.

1:30:44.958 --> 1:30:45.958
I'm cool on my own.

1:30:47.791 --> 1:30:48.958
Seth, wait!

1:30:49.041 --> 1:30:50.041
[pants]

1:30:50.125 --> 1:30:51.500
Let me see what's going on.

1:30:53.125 --> 1:30:56.750
No, you guys, that money isn't stolen.
It's from DCFS.

1:30:56.833 --> 1:30:59.125
The state gives us money
to cover Seth's living expenses,

1:30:59.208 --> 1:31:00.375
but we just give it to him.

1:31:00.458 --> 1:31:02.750
-What about the break-ins?
-[Zoey] It wasn't Seth.

1:31:02.833 --> 1:31:06.583
Someone broke into Anne's house
during the party while Seth was grounded.

1:31:06.666 --> 1:31:09.500
Seth is still out there,
and we have no idea where to look for him.

1:31:11.500 --> 1:31:13.291
-I think I do.
-Yo--

1:31:13.958 --> 1:31:15.250
-Come on!
-Hey, let's go!

1:31:15.333 --> 1:31:17.416
No, no, no. No. You guys-- No.

1:31:18.083 --> 1:31:21.000
He doesn't need our help right--
Harley-- Wait just a second.

1:31:21.083 --> 1:31:23.875
Deja, DJ, get down here right now.
We're leaving.

1:31:23.958 --> 1:31:26.083
No, Dom. No.

1:31:26.166 --> 1:31:28.416
Nobody is going anywhere.

1:31:29.458 --> 1:31:30.458
Gotta go.

1:31:31.916 --> 1:31:32.916
What?

1:31:33.416 --> 1:31:36.541
You know-- Deja, DJ, let's go, right now.

1:31:36.625 --> 1:31:38.291
[Baker children] Daddy!

1:31:38.375 --> 1:31:40.791
-[Baker children clamoring]
-Hey, watch out!

1:31:40.875 --> 1:31:41.875
Ow!

1:31:41.958 --> 1:31:43.875
-Let's go!
-Hey-- Wait a-- Wait a second.

1:31:43.958 --> 1:31:47.083
-Wait, wait-- Hey, hey.
-Guys, guys, guys, please, please.

1:31:47.166 --> 1:31:48.500
Dad's okay on his own.

1:31:48.583 --> 1:31:50.458
-What's going on?
-What's wrong? Where's Paul?

1:31:50.541 --> 1:31:52.083
Okay, everybody, calm down.

1:31:52.166 --> 1:31:55.625
He's fine. He just went down
to First and Whittier to look for Seth.

1:31:55.708 --> 1:31:58.083
-Wait, First and Whittier?
-Yeah.

1:31:59.250 --> 1:32:01.458
-Paul?
-Yeah?

1:32:08.500 --> 1:32:12.416
[chattering]

1:32:15.291 --> 1:32:16.666
Evening, sir.

1:32:17.791 --> 1:32:22.250
Uh, listen, I'm looking for my nephew.
Have you-- Have you seen this kid?

1:32:23.208 --> 1:32:26.083
Nope.
But I see you got that new iPhone 12.

1:32:26.166 --> 1:32:28.083
-Yeah. I do--
-Uncle Paul?

1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:31.625
Seth. You're okay.

1:32:32.250 --> 1:32:34.083
-How'd you find me?
-Are you kidding?

1:32:34.166 --> 1:32:36.833
I've been sending you birthday cards here
for years.

1:32:36.916 --> 1:32:38.583
-Come on. I'm here to take you home.
-Just go.

1:32:38.666 --> 1:32:40.041
[Baker children] Seth!

1:32:40.125 --> 1:32:41.583
Seth!

1:32:41.666 --> 1:32:43.875
-[Kate] There he is! You found him! Yes!
-[littles] Daddy! Daddy!

1:32:43.958 --> 1:32:46.250
-Guys, what're you-- Babe, I got this.
-Seth!

1:32:46.333 --> 1:32:47.916
-[littles] Daddy!
-[Kate] All right.

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:49.375
-Daddy!
-[Paul] Hi, guys--

1:32:49.458 --> 1:32:53.083
Don't worry. He already had booster seats.
The bird man has four kids.

1:32:53.166 --> 1:32:54.333
[chuckles]

1:32:54.416 --> 1:32:57.041
Yo. Who invited the Jackson 9?

1:32:57.125 --> 1:32:59.916
If y'all looking for Disneyland,
you made a wrong turn.

1:33:01.416 --> 1:33:04.250
-Seth, thank God we found you.
-Please come home, Seth?

1:33:04.333 --> 1:33:06.250
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:33:06.333 --> 1:33:07.458
[Bailey] Please.

1:33:07.541 --> 1:33:09.083
Ooh.

1:33:11.250 --> 1:33:12.333
This you, player?

1:33:12.416 --> 1:33:15.458
-Stop it.
-Hey. Don't objectify my mommy.

1:33:15.541 --> 1:33:18.708
Okay. Let's-- Everyone-- Let's go.
I got this, okay? I can take it from here.

1:33:18.791 --> 1:33:20.666
-Moving out.
-[Baker children] No!

1:33:20.750 --> 1:33:23.041
No way. We're staying.

1:33:23.125 --> 1:33:24.875
I mean, we're family, man.

1:33:24.958 --> 1:33:26.541
And we got your back, dude.

1:33:26.625 --> 1:33:27.916
-Yeah.
-[Baker children] Yeah.

1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.166
-Definitely.
-Yeah, I do too, Seth.

1:33:30.250 --> 1:33:34.375
Uh, you know, even though I didn't really
when Harley and I accused you of stealing.

1:33:34.458 --> 1:33:36.833
Yeah, that was kind of harsh. My bad.

1:33:36.916 --> 1:33:39.750
You're the only one that knows
how to make monster spray.

1:33:39.833 --> 1:33:41.375
We need refills.

1:33:41.458 --> 1:33:43.791
Bro, come back, dude.

1:33:43.875 --> 1:33:47.416
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
made it through these past few weeks.

1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:48.500
You're my bro.

1:33:48.583 --> 1:33:52.083
You had my back when I needed you,
and now I'm a legend.

1:33:52.166 --> 1:33:54.500
-OG homeys for life, dude.
-[chuckles]

1:33:56.041 --> 1:33:57.708
Little Indian dude's got heart.

1:33:58.333 --> 1:33:59.416
And a nice chain.

1:33:59.500 --> 1:34:01.500
-I see you, player. Give me some.
-Thank you.

1:34:01.583 --> 1:34:03.708
-[Bailey] Dude.
-Okay, look, Seth--

1:34:04.291 --> 1:34:07.958
Please come home, Seth.
I'll introduce you to my teddy bears.

1:34:09.375 --> 1:34:11.791
Seth, I know you're upset.

1:34:12.875 --> 1:34:16.708
I get it. You have been passed around
so much you don't know who to trust.

1:34:18.166 --> 1:34:19.333
That's not fair.

1:34:19.416 --> 1:34:21.500
I promise you
this time's gonna be different.

1:34:21.583 --> 1:34:25.041
No matter what happens with your mom,
you're always gonna have a home with us.

1:34:25.125 --> 1:34:26.125
-Right, guys?
-Yeah, man.

1:34:26.208 --> 1:34:27.416
-Yeah.
-[Bailey] Definitely.

1:34:27.500 --> 1:34:29.166
-Yeah!
-Come down.

1:34:29.250 --> 1:34:30.583
Thanks, guys. I--

1:34:30.666 --> 1:34:33.458
I know you mean it, but let's face it.
[sighs]

1:34:33.541 --> 1:34:35.666
I'm never gonna fit into
your fancy new life.

1:34:35.750 --> 1:34:37.208
Well, guess what.

1:34:37.291 --> 1:34:40.333
We don't fit in with our fancy new life
either. Right, guys?

1:34:40.416 --> 1:34:41.833
-Not in the slightest!
-No!

1:34:41.916 --> 1:34:43.000
-Come on.
-Come on, Seth!

1:34:43.083 --> 1:34:46.500
Come home, Seth.
Love like this is hard to find.

1:34:47.583 --> 1:34:49.333
-[Baker children] Seth! Seth! Seth!
-[chuckles]

1:34:49.916 --> 1:34:51.125
Come on.

1:34:51.208 --> 1:34:53.375
-Come on, Seth!
-Come on, man.

1:34:53.458 --> 1:34:55.541
[Baker children] Seth! Seth! Seth!

1:34:55.625 --> 1:34:57.416
Seth! Seth! Seth!

1:34:57.500 --> 1:34:59.000
-Seth! Seth! Seth!
-Seth! Come home.

1:34:59.083 --> 1:35:00.208
See you later, guys.

1:35:03.333 --> 1:35:05.375
-Let's go home.
-[Baker family cheers]

1:35:05.458 --> 1:35:06.833
-[Haresh] Woo-hoo!
-[DJ] Yeah!

1:35:08.583 --> 1:35:10.291
Seth! Seth! Seth!

1:35:10.375 --> 1:35:11.583
Seth! Seth! Seth!

1:35:11.666 --> 1:35:13.375
-Seth! Seth!
-Come on, man.

1:35:13.458 --> 1:35:14.916
Seth! Seth!

1:35:15.500 --> 1:35:18.541
-Seth! Seth! Seth!
-How about a group hug? Group hug!

1:35:18.625 --> 1:35:21.000
[Luna] Yay! Woo-hoo! [laughs]

1:35:21.083 --> 1:35:22.708
[Paul] Don't crush the twins.

1:35:22.791 --> 1:35:23.791
Hey!

1:35:25.208 --> 1:35:28.083
Oh. [stammers]
I hate when I get so emotional.

1:35:32.500 --> 1:35:34.166
[Dom] All right. Hey.

1:35:35.125 --> 1:35:36.583
-[Paul] Hey.
-[Luna] Are we home?

1:35:36.666 --> 1:35:37.958
Yeah, baby, we're home.

1:35:38.666 --> 1:35:41.375
You guys go upstairs and get in bed.
I'll come tuck you in. Okay?

1:35:41.458 --> 1:35:42.750
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:35:43.458 --> 1:35:44.708
-Thank you, Dom.
-Yeah.

1:35:44.791 --> 1:35:46.500
Hey, guys. [sighs]

1:35:47.250 --> 1:35:48.250
Uh…

1:35:48.333 --> 1:35:53.250
I overreacted, you know, about the whole
full custody thing. I don't mean that.

1:35:54.041 --> 1:35:57.083
You know, you and Zoey are raising
an amazing family here,

1:35:57.166 --> 1:35:59.458
and I'm glad you guys are part of it.

1:35:59.541 --> 1:36:01.000
And you're right, Paul.

1:36:01.083 --> 1:36:06.083
I missed out on a lot
of the boots-on-the-ground stuff.

1:36:06.166 --> 1:36:08.958
You know, teaching this guy
to brush his teeth, ride a bike--

1:36:09.041 --> 1:36:10.916
Do not regret the teeth stuff.

1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.083
I'm telling you,
a four-year-old's morning breath--

1:36:13.166 --> 1:36:15.333
It's like a tiny dragon melting your face.

1:36:15.416 --> 1:36:17.250
-[imitates dragon breath]
-[DJ laughing]

1:36:17.333 --> 1:36:18.333
Still, man,

1:36:19.958 --> 1:36:21.208
you got all that,

1:36:22.625 --> 1:36:23.625
and I didn't.

1:36:24.208 --> 1:36:25.708
-So, wait, you're jealous of me?
-No.

1:36:25.791 --> 1:36:28.291
-No, that-- Of course not. No.
-That wouldn't make any sense.

1:36:28.375 --> 1:36:30.333
And DJ, you're right, buddy.

1:36:30.416 --> 1:36:32.750
I don't know anything
about what you're into.

1:36:32.833 --> 1:36:35.125
-Yeah.
-But I really want to.

1:36:36.333 --> 1:36:37.875
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:36:38.750 --> 1:36:42.000
Yeah, I tell you what. How about
you and me go to Comic-Con this year?

1:36:42.083 --> 1:36:43.708
You know, make some noise.
What do you say?

1:36:43.791 --> 1:36:46.416
What? Yeah. Heck yeah.

1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:47.625
Yo, you wanna cosplay?

1:36:47.708 --> 1:36:49.333
[stammers]

1:36:49.416 --> 1:36:51.791
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Whatever you want.

1:36:51.875 --> 1:36:54.875
Yes! I'ma bring my comics.
We have so many choices.

1:36:54.958 --> 1:36:57.375
Cool. [chuckles] All right, man.

1:36:58.750 --> 1:37:00.291
What did I just get myself into here?

1:37:00.375 --> 1:37:05.166
You, my friend, just got yourself into
a pair of 4XL tights and a cape.

1:37:05.750 --> 1:37:07.250
That's gonna be great.

1:37:15.125 --> 1:37:16.208
Thank you for asking that.

1:37:16.291 --> 1:37:18.125
That is a great question, Bethany.
Thank you.

1:37:18.208 --> 1:37:20.375
-Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.
-I tried. I couldn't stop him.

1:37:20.458 --> 1:37:22.791
Paul, what's up?
We aren't scheduled to sign the paperwork

1:37:22.875 --> 1:37:24.916
-until next week.
-Yeah, that's no longer happening.

1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.791
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about lunch, Melanie.

1:37:27.875 --> 1:37:30.791
That ridiculous little meal
between breakfast and dinner,

1:37:30.875 --> 1:37:33.083
which, FYI, I am also not doing.

1:37:33.166 --> 1:37:35.041
Paul, I think you're overreacting.

1:37:35.125 --> 1:37:38.000
Am I? Because let me tell you
a little something about me.

1:37:38.083 --> 1:37:40.708
I love breakfast.

1:37:40.791 --> 1:37:43.416
Breakfast is my jam.

1:37:44.541 --> 1:37:47.208
Jam is also my jam.
There're some wonderful jams.

1:37:47.291 --> 1:37:50.041
I love marmalades, um, jellies.

1:37:50.125 --> 1:37:53.125
Quince paste is delightful sometimes
on a cheese board.

1:37:53.875 --> 1:37:55.333
I digress. I don't want any of it.

1:37:55.416 --> 1:37:58.833
I want my name back, I want my brand back,
and I want all the rights to my sauce.

1:37:58.916 --> 1:38:00.541
I've sold enough to buy it all back.

1:38:00.625 --> 1:38:03.708
Paul, if you walk away from this
over a lunch menu,

1:38:03.791 --> 1:38:05.250
you're making a huge mistake.

1:38:05.333 --> 1:38:06.583
-Huge mistake.
-[Paul] I know.

1:38:06.666 --> 1:38:09.458
"Millions of dollars and becoming
a household name" and all that.

1:38:09.541 --> 1:38:12.666
Well, guess what. Chef Boyardee was
a rock star, but that's not me.

1:38:12.750 --> 1:38:15.875
I would rather be broke and at home,
making omelets for my kids

1:38:15.958 --> 1:38:18.875
than being a corporate sellout,
making soup for you two.

1:38:19.458 --> 1:38:21.375
Chef Boyardee was a real person?

1:38:21.458 --> 1:38:24.375
You're not gonna, like, sue me for this,
are you? Please don't.

1:38:24.458 --> 1:38:27.166
'Cause I don't--
I have so many children, and they're--

1:38:27.250 --> 1:38:28.833
They're so expensive.

1:38:28.916 --> 1:38:29.916
She knows.

1:38:32.458 --> 1:38:34.416
Cool if I come by tomorrow
to help you unpack?

1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:36.500
I don't know.

1:38:36.583 --> 1:38:38.625
Calabasas to Echo Park is no joke.

1:38:39.291 --> 1:38:41.791
You sure you're up
for a long-distance relationship?

1:38:41.875 --> 1:38:44.583
-You think I'm scared of a little traffic?
-You should be.

1:38:45.291 --> 1:38:47.250
I am. But you're worth it.

1:38:47.333 --> 1:38:48.541
[chuckles]

1:38:48.625 --> 1:38:49.708
You're so corny.

1:38:49.791 --> 1:38:51.750
-[Tricia, Zoey] Aw.
-[Karen chuckles]

1:38:51.833 --> 1:38:54.541
Okay, now you have to promise
that you're still gonna come around

1:38:54.625 --> 1:38:56.000
-for our mommy playdates.
-Yeah.

1:38:56.083 --> 1:38:58.208
Are you kidding me? Of course.

1:38:58.291 --> 1:38:59.416
[gasps] Wait, is, uh…

1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:01.041
Is Anne gonna be there?

1:39:01.125 --> 1:39:02.416
Oh, no.

1:39:02.500 --> 1:39:04.583
She moved to Idaho for the diversity.

1:39:05.708 --> 1:39:06.708
That tracks.

1:39:07.791 --> 1:39:09.666
-[Deja] Hey, Paul.
-Yeah?

1:39:09.750 --> 1:39:14.166
I'm glad we're leaving, but I'm sorry
for being such a jerk to you about it.

1:39:14.250 --> 1:39:15.833
You weren't being a jerk.

1:39:16.958 --> 1:39:18.625
I appreciate everything you said.

1:39:19.375 --> 1:39:23.583
You know, sometimes one of the most
loving things you can do for someone

1:39:24.083 --> 1:39:26.833
is tell them a hard truth
that they really need to hear.

1:39:26.916 --> 1:39:28.166
You suck at basketball.

1:39:31.833 --> 1:39:33.958
Why would you lie

1:39:34.041 --> 1:39:37.125
when I just gave you a lecture
about the truth?

1:39:37.750 --> 1:39:41.708
[Paul] So we moved out of Calabasas
and back to vibrant LA.

1:39:42.208 --> 1:39:43.958
The kids went back to their old schools.

1:39:44.041 --> 1:39:45.750
-[Zoey] Deja rejoined her old team…
-Come on, Deja!

1:39:45.833 --> 1:39:47.458
…and got her scholarship to USC.

1:39:48.958 --> 1:39:50.666
-[bird man] Come on!
-[Kate] She's so good.

1:39:50.750 --> 1:39:54.666
[Paul] Kate got a great guy
with four kids and nine birds.

1:39:54.750 --> 1:39:58.708
[Zoey] And Dom got a cool new girlfriend
with two dogs and very healthy boundaries.

1:39:58.791 --> 1:40:00.041
[Paul] That's a little tight.

1:40:00.750 --> 1:40:02.250
[both grunting]

1:40:02.333 --> 1:40:03.541
[cheering]

1:40:03.625 --> 1:40:05.000
My house, baby.

1:40:05.083 --> 1:40:06.291
What?

1:40:06.375 --> 1:40:10.333
[Paul] And we found the perfect home
for our perfectly imperfect family.

1:40:10.416 --> 1:40:13.083
Wait, you guys, before we go in,
let's all take a selfie.

1:40:13.166 --> 1:40:14.250
Here we go.

1:40:15.208 --> 1:40:18.291
[Baker family cheers]

1:40:20.375 --> 1:40:21.708
[Paul] All right, baby, try this.

1:40:24.375 --> 1:40:25.375
Mmm.

1:40:25.875 --> 1:40:28.583
-Yum. What is that?
-Right? It's my latest invention.

1:40:28.666 --> 1:40:30.541
It's a croissant soufflé.

1:40:30.625 --> 1:40:33.541
I'm gonna call it a "croissant souff-hey."

1:40:33.625 --> 1:40:34.958
Dad, stop.

1:40:35.041 --> 1:40:36.916
-Guys, that's so bad.
-All right, everybody.

1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.750
Well, since you're all such critics,
what do you think of this?

1:40:39.833 --> 1:40:41.166
-[Zoey] This is amazing.
-What is that?

1:40:41.250 --> 1:40:43.458
-[Paul] With a new label.
-[Ella] It's us.

1:40:43.541 --> 1:40:45.875
-[Paul] Sit down.
-[Zoey] When did you get the time?

1:40:45.958 --> 1:40:47.666
It's us. We look so cute.

1:40:47.750 --> 1:40:49.708
-I'm on here?
-Of course you are.

1:40:49.791 --> 1:40:51.500
-You're part of the family.
-That's so cool.

1:40:51.583 --> 1:40:52.750
Dude, this is dope.

1:40:52.833 --> 1:40:54.000
There's two of me.

1:40:54.083 --> 1:40:56.375
-One of them is me.
-There's two of us?

1:40:56.458 --> 1:40:58.041
[laughing]

1:40:58.125 --> 1:41:02.000
All right,
who wants some more croissant souff-hey?

1:41:02.083 --> 1:41:03.666
-[laughs]
-[children cheering]

1:41:03.750 --> 1:41:06.458
-Right? That's what it is.
-[Paul] Now you guys like it?

1:41:06.541 --> 1:41:09.833
[Paul] So I didn't get my franchise,
but I got something better.

1:41:09.916 --> 1:41:11.166
I got my family

1:41:11.666 --> 1:41:14.708
and a life that's the perfect size
for all of our dreams.

1:41:15.333 --> 1:41:19.791
And at the end of the day,
there is no sweeter dream than that.
