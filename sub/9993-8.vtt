WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.415
Everyone likes to guess.

00:03.004 --> 00:03.849
Heads or tails?

00:03.900 --> 00:04.979
Tails or heads?

00:05.186 --> 00:06.450
Go ahead, try it.

00:06.595 --> 00:08.793
Chances are you'll be right at least half the time.

00:09.284 --> 00:10.839
Will it be a boy or a girl?

00:11.023 --> 00:12.511
Everyone thinks they know--

00:12.638 --> 00:14.943
and chances are good at least half the people will be right.

00:17.612 --> 00:18.739
The candidate you want?

00:21.937 --> 00:24.372
Or the other guy?

00:30.472 --> 00:32.451
Nice to see you, Bud.
Appreciate your support.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.304
Nice to see you, Mike.

01:24.263 --> 01:25.289
Good choice, Mike.

01:31.094 --> 01:32.849
I know I can count on you,
Allison.

02:13.869 --> 02:14.691
Hey...

02:16.148 --> 02:16.969
you all right?

02:17.635 --> 02:18.565
What's going on?

02:19.066 --> 02:20.104
Oh, it was nothing.

02:20.254 --> 02:21.607
It was just a bad dream.

02:22.166 --> 02:22.901
It was just a...

02:23.296 --> 02:25.143
just a normal bad dream.

02:25.441 --> 02:28.504
Just... anxiety about Devalos.

02:28.555 --> 02:29.676
About the election.

02:33.796 --> 02:35.705
Aha. I see.

02:38.071 --> 02:41.329
My wife is suffering from "electile" dysfunction.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.183
Now that's scary.

03:32.390 --> 03:35.300
I'm voting for Mommy's boss.
Are you voting for Mommy's boss?

03:35.351 --> 03:37.325
What are you talking about?
You can't vote.

03:37.376 --> 03:39.548
Yes I can; I can do whatever I want to.

03:39.599 --> 03:41.119
Mommy says I can do anything,

03:41.284 --> 03:42.958
if I put my mind to it.

03:43.305 --> 03:44.759
This has nothing to do with Mommy.

03:44.810 --> 03:47.081
You're not old enough.
It's against the law.

03:47.209 --> 03:48.686
What do you mean "against the law"?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.340
Are you old enough?

03:52.022 --> 03:53.915
Duh! I can't even drive yet.

03:54.224 --> 03:56.921
Okay, look, this is how it works:

03:57.077 --> 04:01.682
When you're 16, you get to drive and see R-rated movies.

04:01.754 --> 04:04.356
When you're 18, you get to go to college and vote,

04:04.407 --> 04:05.786
and at 21,

04:05.938 --> 04:08.684
you get to drink and do whatever you want.

04:09.144 --> 04:10.181
Says who?

04:11.104 --> 04:13.730
Sorry, but there'll be no drinking, driving,

04:14.280 --> 04:17.925
and nobody in this family is going anywhere
until you girls learn how to make your beds

04:18.017 --> 04:19.240
and do your own laundry.

04:19.505 --> 04:21.374
But that stuff is hard!

04:21.579 --> 04:22.768
Tell me about it.

04:22.819 --> 04:24.287
Wow!
Look at all this stuff!

04:24.338 --> 04:25.731
All stuffed and ready to go.

04:26.765 --> 04:28.558
Did anybody remember to get a sitter?

04:29.553 --> 04:31.202
Uh, I don't know.
Anybody?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.019
Marie, did you remember to get a sitter?

04:34.569 --> 04:36.088
Are you guys going out tonight?

04:36.176 --> 04:36.777
Yep.

04:37.056 --> 04:40.415
It turns out the temperature in Hades has finally plummeted below zero,

04:40.466 --> 04:43.007
and your mother and I are going to go out and we're going to see a movie

04:43.058 --> 04:45.014
and maybe we're gonna get some dinner-- alone.

04:45.196 --> 04:46.180
With just each other.

04:46.243 --> 04:46.893
Wow.

04:47.137 --> 04:50.209
Everybody's gonna think I have a little workshop of elves working for me.

04:51.146 --> 04:52.022
Hey, look at this:

04:52.073 --> 04:55.476
There's a special sneak preview tonight of Memoirs of a Geisha.

04:55.774 --> 04:57.137
Didn't you like that book?

04:57.330 --> 04:59.261
Yeah, I really liked it.
We should try to get in.

04:59.779 --> 05:00.638
What's a geisha?

05:01.257 --> 05:02.063
Ask your mother.

05:02.533 --> 05:03.495
What's a geisha?

05:05.035 --> 05:06.136
What's a geisha?

05:17.636 --> 05:20.093
Well, things are going to be a little different under my watch,
Mr. Mayor.

05:21.027 --> 05:22.042
Yeah, trust me.

05:22.783 --> 05:25.346
I'm not afraid to knock a few heads from time to time.

05:26.898 --> 05:28.066
Yeah, you can count on me.

05:29.908 --> 05:30.636
Allison...

05:34.231 --> 05:35.083
What's the matter?

05:38.489 --> 05:39.931
No... nothing.

05:40.971 --> 05:44.112
I'm well aware that, traditionally,
the candidates only debate once,

05:44.163 --> 05:48.708
but why not give the voters a second chance to decide? Hmm?

05:49.176 --> 05:51.742
I mean, you can't have too much democracy.

05:52.295 --> 05:53.934
Oh, come off it, Nate.

05:53.985 --> 05:56.943
We'll be lucky to fill the damn hall
for one debate, much less two;

05:56.994 --> 05:58.092
quit grandstanding.

05:58.221 --> 05:59.341
There are no cameras here.

06:00.502 --> 06:02.349
All right,
Mr. District Attorney.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.834
Have it your way.
I get it.

06:04.102 --> 06:04.935
You're ahead in the polls.

06:04.986 --> 06:07.178
You don't see any up-side to debating me more than once,

06:07.229 --> 06:08.167
but, remember,

06:08.872 --> 06:12.256
things can change very quickly in politics.

06:19.951 --> 06:23.051
A  young woman is raped and murdered in her own home.

06:23.102 --> 06:24.935
Just this week, this man,

06:24.986 --> 06:25.849
Clyde Morton,

06:25.900 --> 06:28.001
was arrested in connection with the attack--

06:28.052 --> 06:31.290
the same Clyde Morton who was arrested for breaking into an elderly

06:31.341 --> 06:32.774
couple's home with a firearm,

06:32.825 --> 06:34.562
just three years ago.

06:34.613 --> 06:37.734
Why wasn't this dangerous criminal behind bars?

06:37.785 --> 06:40.481
Why did an innocent woman have to die?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.649
Because District Attorney Manuel Devalos

06:42.700 --> 06:45.524
refused to prosecute
to the full extent of the law.

06:45.575 --> 06:48.981
Isn't it time Phoenix had a prosecutor tough enough to do the job?

06:49.032 --> 06:51.308
Vote Nathan Bradley: new blood,

06:51.359 --> 06:53.608
new breed, solid values.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.981
Paid for by the Committee to Elect Nathan Bradley.

06:59.515 --> 07:00.494
Clyde Morton?

07:00.555 --> 07:02.370
What are you talking about?
He's a scared kid.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.199
At least he was three or four years ago.

07:05.131 --> 07:06.598
Yeah. Thank you.

07:10.192 --> 07:11.639
Yeah, that's him.

07:11.690 --> 07:15.261
He was arrested for breaking and entering--
14, maybe 15 years old.

07:15.312 --> 07:17.004
Remanded to juvenile detention.

07:17.492 --> 07:18.474
Is he out yet?

07:18.764 --> 07:19.661
Should be.

07:20.552 --> 07:21.514
About a month ago.

07:24.726 --> 07:27.286
I remember the mayor made a big stink about this.

07:27.566 --> 07:29.380
Wanted me to try him as an adult.

07:29.431 --> 07:32.220
He was carrying this ancient weapon, with one bullet--

07:32.271 --> 07:33.864
in his pocket, as I recall.

07:33.915 --> 07:35.778
The bullet wasn't even in the gun.

07:35.964 --> 07:38.797
And according to the old man and old woman whose apartment he broke into

07:38.848 --> 07:40.415
the gun never came out of his pocket.

07:41.703 --> 07:44.304
Now,  what in the world does this have to do with my opponent?

07:44.793 --> 07:47.520
Apparently, sometime between now and the election,

07:47.571 --> 07:50.538
Clyde Morton is going to rape and murder a young woman here in Phoenix.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.520
And you know this...?

07:54.803 --> 07:57.475
I saw an ad that your opponent is going to air after it happens.

07:58.328 --> 07:59.749
I mean, I saw it in my head.

08:00.353 --> 08:01.334
And I saw Bradley.

08:01.385 --> 08:02.537
I saw him here.

08:03.542 --> 08:05.683
Right where you are,
behind your desk.

08:18.575 --> 08:20.208
We have to find a way to stop this,

08:20.259 --> 08:21.551
save this woman's life.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.155
Bradley is going to use this against you.

08:24.490 --> 08:25.728
So what are we gonna do?

08:27.234 --> 08:28.906
I don't think there's anything to do.

08:29.537 --> 08:32.054
I can't protect the victim.
We don't know who she is.

08:32.818 --> 08:36.592
And I can't very well arrest Clyde Morton for a crime he's yet to commit.

08:36.907 --> 08:39.378
Well, I know that, but can't we send
someone there to keep an eye on him?

08:39.429 --> 08:41.450
Can't we send the police to his house,

08:41.501 --> 08:43.129
let him know that he's being watched?

08:43.659 --> 08:45.270
I could give his parole officer a call.

08:45.812 --> 08:47.217
Well, I don't think that's going to do it.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.877
Well, give me a name of the victim,

08:48.928 --> 08:50.481
or at least a description.

08:50.532 --> 08:52.611
I'll put her under round-the-clock protection.

08:52.770 --> 08:53.664
I don't have it.

08:53.913 --> 08:55.729
Well, then, I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

08:57.484 --> 08:58.858
I could've tried this kid as an adult,

08:58.909 --> 09:00.456
locked him up for a long, long time,

09:00.507 --> 09:02.568
but my gut told me not to do it.

09:02.689 --> 09:05.249
My gut told me that he just made a stupid mistake.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.821
That he's basically a decent kid who could use a second chance.

09:07.872 --> 09:10.664
And now you're telling me that he's gonna kill somebody?

09:12.109 --> 09:13.801
Considering that I don't have a lot of options,

09:13.852 --> 09:16.191
I hope you understand when I say that I'm hoping...

09:17.639 --> 09:18.651
with all my heart...

09:19.816 --> 09:20.723
that you're wrong.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.802
Two for Memoirs of a Geisha, please.

09:29.364 --> 09:31.405
Uh, is that the line to go inside?

09:31.456 --> 09:32.661
Okay. Thank you.

09:33.097 --> 09:33.753
Thank you.

09:33.883 --> 09:36.188
So, what'll it be?
Food? Call the kids?

09:36.239 --> 09:37.157
- Little of both?
- Candy.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.619
Oh, my God! Joe?!

09:39.225 --> 09:40.344
Joe Dubois?

09:41.800 --> 09:42.748
Karen!

09:45.667 --> 09:47.631
- Karen, I don't believe it...
- Joe.

09:47.994 --> 09:50.733
I thought I heard you lived in Phoenix.

09:50.784 --> 09:52.314
Hey. What are you doing here?

09:55.669 --> 09:57.165
This sure beats physics.

09:57.975 --> 09:59.219
This is physics.

10:01.176 --> 10:02.308
Everything is physics.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.625
Well, Steve's folks live here. Steve?

10:06.192 --> 10:07.450
This is my husband Steve.

10:07.501 --> 10:09.784
This is an old friend from grad school,

10:09.835 --> 10:10.794
Joe Dubois.

10:11.389 --> 10:12.252
Uh, hi.

10:12.303 --> 10:14.246
Allison--
This is my wife Allison.

10:14.668 --> 10:16.245
This is Karen Jane.

10:16.507 --> 10:17.487
Herzfeld now.

10:17.995 --> 10:18.957
Karen Herzfeld.

10:19.076 --> 10:19.750
Um...

10:21.037 --> 10:23.552
Wow, we were research fellows in grad school,

10:23.603 --> 10:24.822
many moons ago.

10:25.044 --> 10:26.526
Well, not that many moons ago.

10:27.935 --> 10:29.637
Well, nice to meet you,
"research fellow".

10:29.705 --> 10:31.799
Nice to meet you,
research fellow's husband.

10:31.850 --> 10:33.260
Research fellow's wife.

10:34.113 --> 10:35.558
So what have you been up to?

10:35.791 --> 10:38.161
Me? Well, I've been up to kids.

10:38.284 --> 10:39.148
And dogs,

10:39.199 --> 10:40.480
and this guy,

10:40.966 --> 10:42.304
and our real estate business.

10:42.395 --> 10:44.509
Real estate. Wow.
Well, who'd-a thunk it?

10:45.412 --> 10:49.180
And you are the chairman of what physics program at what university?

10:49.615 --> 10:50.743
Oh, well,
none of the above.

10:50.794 --> 10:53.417
I'm  a project engineer at Aerodytech.

10:53.843 --> 10:55.769
Okay.
I can see that.

10:58.332 --> 10:59.856
So what are you guys here to see?

10:59.907 --> 11:01.880
Uh, the, uh, the geisha movie.

11:02.121 --> 11:03.769
Oh, we just got out.
You're gonna love it.

11:03.987 --> 11:05.061
Well, good.

11:05.451 --> 11:07.362
Oh, wow, okay,
look, that's us.

11:07.422 --> 11:10.474
God, it was great to see you.

11:10.564 --> 11:11.424
You,  too.

11:12.041 --> 11:13.147
We should all get together.

11:13.251 --> 11:14.926
We should.
Yes, absolutely.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.537
I'll call you at your office.

11:18.184 --> 11:20.117
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

11:20.220 --> 11:21.295
- Do that.
- Okay then.

11:21.388 --> 11:22.036
Okay.

11:22.646 --> 11:24.069
So nice to meet you,
Allison.

11:24.801 --> 11:25.985
Nice to meet you.

11:30.726 --> 11:31.602
She's pretty.

11:32.429 --> 11:34.024
That's how you get to be a geisha.

11:34.358 --> 11:35.842
No, I meant Karen.

11:36.966 --> 11:38.269
Oh, yeah. I guess.

11:42.177 --> 11:44.546
I don't think I remember you mentioning her before.

11:45.345 --> 11:48.015
We had a seminar together for, like, one semester.

11:48.558 --> 11:50.674
I think after that,
she transferred away or something.

11:52.249 --> 11:55.117
Man, for a second there,
I almost couldn't remember her name.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.914
Do you think she noticed,
or did I cover okay?

12:01.326 --> 12:04.054
Oh, no, you cover great.

12:06.132 --> 12:07.699
Hang onto that one.

12:09.833 --> 12:13.163
Oh, damn, I left the window open this morning.

12:13.217 --> 12:14.697
The cat's going to have gotten out.

12:16.353 --> 12:18.784
Me? I'm hanging in.

12:19.457 --> 12:21.809
No, nobody yet.

12:24.848 --> 12:27.177
I'm just not ready to get back out there, you know?

12:27.967 --> 12:30.755
Titu? Where are you?

12:30.894 --> 12:32.329
Besides, I have a cat.

12:32.592 --> 12:34.048
Or at least I had a cat.

12:34.677 --> 12:36.057
Titu?

12:37.887 --> 12:38.694
Titu?

12:39.705 --> 12:42.476
Oh! He must have gotten out.

12:44.058 --> 12:44.927
It's all right.

12:46.129 --> 12:47.572
He'll come back when he's hungry.

12:50.020 --> 12:50.942
Is that your other line?

12:52.059 --> 12:53.826
All right. Talk to you later.

12:54.686 --> 12:55.286
Bye.

12:58.879 --> 13:02.144
Titu? Where are you hiding?

13:05.385 --> 13:06.159
Titu?

13:09.103 --> 13:12.587
Titu! Hey!

13:50.084 --> 13:50.818
Good morning.

13:52.653 --> 13:53.780
Hey, what's going on?

13:54.361 --> 13:55.898
You looking for another movie?

13:56.198 --> 13:58.594
Yeah, I was just hoping we could run into more old girlfriends.

14:00.389 --> 14:01.823
Okay...

14:03.349 --> 14:05.084
Is there something you want to talk to me about?

14:05.606 --> 14:07.696
I don't know--
is there something you want to talk to me about?

14:08.541 --> 14:10.379
Are you still mad about last night?

14:10.705 --> 14:13.132
I run into an old friend,
an old married friend.

14:13.808 --> 14:15.166
What is the big deal?

14:19.485 --> 14:20.876
Is she in the paper or something?

14:22.510 --> 14:23.481
I had a dream last night.

14:23.532 --> 14:25.525
I saw this woman.
She came home from work.

14:25.576 --> 14:27.393
There was a stranger in her house. He...

14:28.650 --> 14:29.685
I just thought...

14:32.648 --> 14:34.506
Maybe it happened last night.
Maybe it's in the paper.

14:35.783 --> 14:37.268
And this woman was Karen?

14:38.570 --> 14:40.525
You know what? Forget it.
Forget about that.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.727
I'm  just a little thrown,
that's all.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.916
I can see that.

14:44.048 --> 14:45.339
You want to tell me why?

14:45.531 --> 14:46.518
I don't know.

14:48.441 --> 14:50.062
I guess I thought I knew about everyone.

14:50.113 --> 14:52.503
I guess I thought that we told each other everything.

14:52.591 --> 14:53.943
We have. We did.

14:55.097 --> 14:56.973
Well, clearly,
you left someone out!

14:58.453 --> 14:59.283
I don't think so.

14:59.904 --> 15:00.753
You know what?

15:00.981 --> 15:03.485
Remember who you're talking to and try that one again.

15:05.577 --> 15:06.330
You know what?

15:07.254 --> 15:10.117
I have no idea what conversation I'm in.

15:11.334 --> 15:12.755
- Fine.
- Fine.

15:13.864 --> 15:15.515
"This is physics.

15:15.933 --> 15:17.904
Everything is physics".

15:19.502 --> 15:22.606
Oh, look, it's all coming back to him.

15:24.681 --> 15:25.716
Oh, man.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.363
I understand.
There were so many back then.

15:29.656 --> 15:30.673
Who could keep track?

15:30.926 --> 15:32.317
Allison, come on.

15:32.503 --> 15:34.229
It was 15 years ago.

15:34.918 --> 15:37.155
It only happened once and we were very drunk.

15:37.613 --> 15:38.681
But it did happen!

15:39.090 --> 15:41.415
I forgot, okay?

15:41.944 --> 15:43.927
Hell, she and I never even talked about it.

15:44.101 --> 15:45.551
We just pretended it never happened.

15:45.872 --> 15:50.136
It was one of those things where we both knew
it was a bad idea the second it was over.

15:50.494 --> 15:51.958
Well, it didn't look that way to me.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.172
You are really overreacting.

15:55.334 --> 15:56.172
Oh, really?

15:57.004 --> 16:00.461
How would you feel if you had a porno movie starring me playing in your head?

16:02.729 --> 16:03.884
You mean, you saw it?

16:04.461 --> 16:06.249
Trust me. It's not something I sought out.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.150
It's not like I saw it in the TV Guide and put it on my must-see list.

16:09.392 --> 16:10.829
It just popped into my head.

16:11.427 --> 16:12.192
You're kidding me.

16:13.035 --> 16:15.358
That is so not fair, Allison.

16:15.847 --> 16:17.267
Not only is that not fair,

16:17.476 --> 16:18.372
it is creepy.

16:18.597 --> 16:20.646
You have no right to get inside my head like that.

16:20.752 --> 16:21.440
Wait a second.

16:21.491 --> 16:23.039
What makes you think I got it out of your head?

16:23.090 --> 16:24.782
Maybe I pulled it out of her head.

16:24.929 --> 16:26.537
This is an absurd conversation.

16:26.588 --> 16:27.806
Maybe she didn't forget about it.

16:27.857 --> 16:30.854
Maybe she didn't think it was a mistake the minute after it was over.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.092
Do you hear yourself?

16:33.143 --> 16:37.169
You're railing at me for something that happened
before I met you that I never think about,

16:37.220 --> 16:39.137
that I actually forgot about.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.845
And what are you yelling at me for?

16:41.261 --> 16:43.485
I have no control over what goes on inside her head!

16:44.118 --> 16:46.188
Besides, it's 15 years ago!

16:46.504 --> 16:48.163
What are you going to say when she calls?

16:48.511 --> 16:50.051
What are you talking about?
She's not going to call.

16:50.164 --> 16:50.997
Yeah, she is.

16:51.048 --> 16:52.738
No, she was just being polite.

16:52.789 --> 16:55.046
She wants something from you,
I can tell.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.299
Wants something?

16:56.366 --> 16:59.495
I guess you didn't notice the significant other she had on her arm.

16:59.548 --> 17:01.706
I didn't mean she wants another physics lesson!

17:04.403 --> 17:05.111
Allison...

17:14.568 --> 17:15.358
Joe Dubois.

17:15.564 --> 17:18.782
Joe, hey. Uh, it's your old physics buddy, Karen.

17:18.945 --> 17:19.546
Karen?

17:20.914 --> 17:22.612
Karen, hi.

17:22.905 --> 17:25.828
Hi. You didn't think I was going to call, did you?

17:27.483 --> 17:29.393
Uh, actually, no, I didn't.

17:29.824 --> 17:30.734
Surprise.

17:30.889 --> 17:31.830
Surprise.

17:32.935 --> 17:34.754
Look, I know you're busy. Um...

17:35.073 --> 17:36.115
No, I'm good.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.498
You sure?
'Cause...

17:38.058 --> 17:39.219
The thing is...

17:41.108 --> 17:42.999
I need to talk to you about something.

17:44.761 --> 17:45.363
Sure.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.940
But I'd really rather do it in person.

17:48.299 --> 17:48.966
Uh-huh.

17:49.927 --> 17:51.601
But  I like it there.

17:52.350 --> 17:53.267
It's weird.

17:53.747 --> 17:55.739
Daddy, tell her she has to take it down.

17:56.658 --> 18:00.228
Have you noticed the eyes seem to follow you no matter where you're standing?

18:00.761 --> 18:02.036
Not funny.

18:02.722 --> 18:03.513
Daddy...

18:03.564 --> 18:04.330
Hey.

18:04.631 --> 18:07.130
Half this room belongs to your sister and she likes it there,

18:07.181 --> 18:08.258
and I like it, too.

18:09.151 --> 18:09.783
Mommy's right.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.530
Nothing wrong with a little political awareness.

18:12.034 --> 18:12.733
Yeah!

18:13.220 --> 18:15.053
You don't even know what he's talking about.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.441
You just like the colors.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.761
Ariel, sweetie, we'll figure it out in the morning, okay?

18:20.811 --> 18:21.649
Okay.

18:22.650 --> 18:23.250
Sleep tight.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.076
You, too, Mommy.

18:25.224 --> 18:27.161
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

18:30.724 --> 18:31.324
Night.

18:31.396 --> 18:32.162
Good night.

18:34.393 --> 18:35.146
Good night.

18:38.948 --> 18:41.214
So he's counting on you to be wrong?

18:42.852 --> 18:43.709
That's his plan?

18:44.584 --> 18:45.229
Apparently.

18:47.604 --> 18:48.974
He's right. There's nothing he can do.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.518
I didn't give him any information he can use.

18:57.725 --> 18:59.955
I am wrong from time to time.

19:01.053 --> 19:02.108
Okay, stop.

19:02.159 --> 19:03.775
Who are you, and what have you done with my wife?

19:04.032 --> 19:05.574
No, I'm serious. He's right.

19:09.123 --> 19:10.586
I misinterpret things...

19:12.772 --> 19:14.059
I overreact.

19:16.808 --> 19:19.400
Sometimes I see smoke where there's no fire.

19:20.508 --> 19:22.229
I'm sorry.
What are we talking about?

19:23.835 --> 19:25.021
Politics.

19:32.216 --> 19:33.493
Old girlfriends.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.547
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

19:44.047 --> 19:44.940
To be fair,

19:46.018 --> 19:49.512
if I found a bunch of dirty pictures of you and an ex,

19:49.563 --> 19:54.452
I think I'd probably be walking around with a dark cloud over my head, too.

19:57.069 --> 19:58.061
And besides,

19:58.112 --> 19:59.347
if it makes you feel any better,

20:00.290 --> 20:01.790
you weren't completely wrong.

20:02.474 --> 20:03.616
She did call today.

20:06.524 --> 20:07.984
Oh, yeah, what did she want?

20:08.102 --> 20:09.381
Lunch, Thursday.

20:09.985 --> 20:11.334
Really? Just the two of you?

20:11.385 --> 20:12.498
Hey, relax.

20:13.391 --> 20:17.024
There's no smoke, there's no fire,
no combustion of any kind.

20:18.236 --> 20:20.191
I invited her to join me in the cafeteria.

20:20.734 --> 20:24.208
Just me and a lunchroom full of my closest colleagues.

20:27.452 --> 20:28.926
Good thinking, Lincoln.

20:30.315 --> 20:31.689
We aim to please, Louise.

21:16.670 --> 21:17.481
You the new valet?

21:18.702 --> 21:19.486
I need a favor.

21:20.465 --> 21:22.956
I've never done this pre-emptive crime-fighting thing before.

21:23.230 --> 21:26.225
Do I at least get one of those flying motorcycles like Tom Cruise had?

21:26.696 --> 21:27.742
Oh, absolutely.

21:27.907 --> 21:30.308
It'll be waiting for you when you return to City Hall.

21:32.506 --> 21:33.937
You sure you're comfortable with this?

21:34.161 --> 21:36.518
Stopping by the kid's house,
letting him know we're watching,

21:36.731 --> 21:38.528
Keep an eye on him?
I'm okay with that.

21:39.331 --> 21:41.177
especially if you think it's gonna make a difference for Manny.

21:41.311 --> 21:42.827
I think it might save a life.

21:44.065 --> 21:46.454
I mean, I know it's not the way it's normally done,

21:47.088 --> 21:48.843
and I... I know it's kind of wrong.

21:52.535 --> 21:53.626
He doesn't know, you know.

21:54.409 --> 21:55.085
Who's that?

21:55.276 --> 21:57.004
Devalos. He doesn't know we're doing this.

21:57.281 --> 21:58.656
I think he'd be upset if he did.

21:59.702 --> 22:01.239
All the more reason not to tell him.

22:07.023 --> 22:08.016
Can I help you?

22:08.396 --> 22:09.380
My name is Lee Scanlon.

22:09.431 --> 22:11.311
I'm a detective with the Phoenix Police Department.

22:12.661 --> 22:14.216
We were hoping to talk with Clyde Morton.

22:14.856 --> 22:15.730
I'm his mother.

22:15.781 --> 22:16.690
He's not in right now.

22:16.834 --> 22:17.878
He's out looking for a job.

22:18.934 --> 22:20.657
Something the matter?
Is he in trouble?

22:21.883 --> 22:23.316
We were just hoping to speak with him.

22:24.474 --> 22:25.393
You don't look like police.

22:25.742 --> 22:27.232
Actually, I work with the D.A's office.

22:28.593 --> 22:29.193
Oh.

22:31.007 --> 22:32.791
Well, I hope he wins, your boss.

22:32.842 --> 22:33.658
He's smart,

22:34.094 --> 22:35.305
and I think he cares.

22:35.924 --> 22:39.402
He could've sent my boy away for years and years,
instead, he exhibited some mercy,

22:39.453 --> 22:41.533
something you don't see much of around here--

22:42.490 --> 22:43.212
Mercy.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.865
Well, that's sort of why we're here, actually.

22:47.022 --> 22:48.271
Make sure that he's okay.

22:49.227 --> 22:51.631
We wouldn't want to see him get himself into any kind of trouble.

22:53.278 --> 22:55.338
I thought that's what the probation officer was for.

22:58.647 --> 23:00.236
You can tell whoever needs to know,

23:00.363 --> 23:02.299
my son doesn't go around looking for trouble anymore.

23:02.350 --> 23:03.521
That's behind him now.

23:03.712 --> 23:04.422
Glad to hear it,

23:04.473 --> 23:06.323
ma'am, but we'd like to talk to him just the same.

23:07.205 --> 23:08.421
Any idea when he's gonna be home?

23:09.674 --> 23:10.592
Been getting in late.

23:11.393 --> 23:12.885
Uh, I think he found himself a girl.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.655
There's no law against that now, is there?

23:16.298 --> 23:17.234
No, ma'am.

23:19.140 --> 23:20.555
If you'd just tell him we dropped by.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.423
Let him know we'll check back.

23:32.592 --> 23:33.805
Well, that felt horrible.

23:35.490 --> 23:38.983
All this Minority Report stuff's not all that it's cracked up to be,

23:39.970 --> 23:41.040
but if it makes you feel better,

23:41.091 --> 23:43.736
Jeffrey Dahmer's mother thought that he was a saint, too.

23:44.901 --> 23:45.681
Clyde?

23:47.682 --> 23:48.818
Clyde Morton?

23:51.934 --> 23:52.639
Stay here.

23:52.966 --> 23:53.688
Hey!

23:54.624 --> 23:55.375
Hey!

24:06.829 --> 24:08.337
They're saying he's got swelling on the brain.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.047
Could be a couple of days before they know if he's going to make it or not.

24:11.796 --> 24:13.403
So what happened?
Why did he run?

24:14.539 --> 24:15.240
I don't know.

24:15.291 --> 24:16.444
We couldn't find anything on him.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.222
Maybe just panic 'cause he figured me for a cop.

24:19.314 --> 24:20.204
It was an accident.

24:20.316 --> 24:20.979
It was a...

24:21.394 --> 24:23.931
stupid, horrible awful accident.

24:25.492 --> 24:28.983
You wouldn't happen to know the definition of "accident" would you, Allison?

24:29.477 --> 24:32.397
I-I'm sorry, I meant the car part.

24:32.448 --> 24:35.308
An accident,
by definition is a chance event.

24:38.150 --> 24:40.116
So am I to simply assume that it was by chance that you

24:40.167 --> 24:43.442
and Detective Scanlon went over to Clyde Morton's house?

24:43.924 --> 24:46.885
Despite the fact that you and I had already discussed it?

24:47.399 --> 24:51.262
Despite the fact that I'd already made it abundantly clear that it is not

24:51.313 --> 24:56.122
the policy of this office to harass citizens based on the possibility

24:56.203 --> 24:58.520
that they might commit illegal acts?

24:59.966 --> 25:01.074
I asked you a question!

25:01.285 --> 25:03.327
Hey, back off. We went there to help you.

25:03.447 --> 25:04.262
Help me?

25:04.953 --> 25:07.057
By violating this man's rights?

25:07.598 --> 25:08.765
By putting him in the hospital?

25:08.816 --> 25:10.240
By using the name of this office?

25:11.374 --> 25:12.581
Thanks, Lee.
thanks for your help.

25:12.632 --> 25:13.232
I'm sorry.

25:13.243 --> 25:14.268
We apologize.

25:15.656 --> 25:16.805
We weren't driving that car.

25:17.566 --> 25:18.256
Right.

25:22.972 --> 25:23.587
Right.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.532
Get me the name of the physician attending Clyde Morton.

25:29.583 --> 25:30.919
See if I can speak with him, please.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.360
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

25:33.611 --> 25:34.495
Don't apologize to me

25:34.546 --> 25:37.168
I'm not the one lying in a hospital bed fighting for his life.

25:39.618 --> 25:40.291
Yeah, go.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.898
I'm trying to locate that doctor and you're ten minutes late for court.

25:48.606 --> 25:49.896
Thank you both very much.

25:50.811 --> 25:52.212
I'll take care of this from here.

25:55.633 --> 25:56.255
Night, honey.

25:56.306 --> 25:57.153
Good night, Daddy.

25:57.733 --> 25:58.383
Good night.

26:00.149 --> 26:02.076
Isn't Mommy going to say good night?

26:02.330 --> 26:04.430
She's going to sneak in later,
when you're asleep.

26:04.793 --> 26:06.378
Well, then, how will I know she did it?

26:07.687 --> 26:08.915
You trust your mom don't you?

26:09.742 --> 26:10.515
I guess.

26:11.620 --> 26:15.610
Tell her that maybe I'll sneak in later while she's asleep

26:16.171 --> 26:17.986
and kiss her good night, too.

26:18.335 --> 26:19.839
I will definitely let her know.

26:28.132 --> 26:29.176
You still waiting?

26:29.227 --> 26:30.690
Hi. Yes.

26:31.221 --> 26:34.454
I'm calling regarding the condition of Clyde Morton.

26:41.028 --> 26:43.305
Thank you. Thank you.

26:45.244 --> 26:46.690
He's still in I.C.U.

26:47.708 --> 26:48.483
Okay.

26:49.736 --> 26:50.831
How do you feel?

26:51.464 --> 26:52.480
Does it, matter?

26:52.751 --> 26:53.894
It matters to me.

26:57.408 --> 26:58.226
Awful.

27:00.776 --> 27:01.653
Sad.

27:03.307 --> 27:04.225
Guilty.

27:04.276 --> 27:05.467
Confused.

27:17.635 --> 27:18.922
I'll go say good night to the girls.

27:21.700 --> 27:22.472
Okay.

27:25.802 --> 27:26.800
Love you.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.758
Nah, didn't make it to the gym,

27:36.911 --> 27:38.140
had to do something after work.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.675
Nothing, I'm fine.

27:44.492 --> 27:46.078
Just a little beat, that's all.

27:47.893 --> 27:48.598
No.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.312
Damn.

27:53.614 --> 27:55.004
I left the window open this morning.

27:55.055 --> 27:56.939
The cat's gonna have gotten out.

27:59.327 --> 28:01.326
Really. I'm fine.

28:03.535 --> 28:07.474
Something happened to somebody I know and I'm kinda bummed about it.

28:08.861 --> 28:09.761
Titu!

28:11.100 --> 28:12.040
Where are you?

28:14.513 --> 28:15.505
Titu!

28:16.516 --> 28:18.193
Can I just tell you about it some other time?

28:18.626 --> 28:20.816
I just want to take a shower,
watch TV, and veg.

28:21.857 --> 28:22.583
Titu?

28:24.541 --> 28:25.265
Here, boy.

28:28.177 --> 28:29.760
Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

28:30.983 --> 28:32.567
You, too. Bye.

28:50.323 --> 28:51.188
Scanlon.

28:51.710 --> 28:52.701
Hi.
It's Allison.

28:52.752 --> 28:54.136
Clyde Morton's out of I.C.U.

28:54.336 --> 28:55.842
Great. I'll be sure and send him a card.

28:56.462 --> 28:57.391
I want to talk to him.

28:57.816 --> 28:59.601
What for? He's obviously not gonna hurt anyone now,

28:59.652 --> 29:00.774
not in the near term, anyway.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.492
I had that dream again last night.

29:02.543 --> 29:04.809
Same woman, same everything.

29:04.996 --> 29:07.374
- A little different clothes, but other than that...
- Allison.

29:07.591 --> 29:09.651
He might know something.
He might be able to shed some light.

29:10.051 --> 29:11.451
You know your boss,
my old friend,

29:11.502 --> 29:12.974
practically had an aneurysm yesterday.

29:13.307 --> 29:15.033
I need to find somebody to look after my kids,

29:15.084 --> 29:16.778
I don't think I can be there till late afternoon.

29:17.025 --> 29:18.528
Do you just not hear "no"?

29:19.623 --> 29:20.975
You want to say 5:00?

29:25.902 --> 29:27.513
- Hey, you.
- Hello.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.158
Thanks for coming all this way.

29:30.325 --> 29:32.362
Well, thank you for seeing me.
I know you're very busy.

29:32.660 --> 29:34.293
No. You said it's important.

29:35.864 --> 29:38.708
So, what's good here?

29:39.262 --> 29:40.622
Nothing. The chairs.

29:41.674 --> 29:42.689
It's close. Hi.

29:42.740 --> 29:43.617
Mr. Dubois.

29:43.668 --> 29:44.503
Thank you.

29:44.586 --> 29:45.623
Ah, you like fish?

29:46.049 --> 29:46.649
Yeah.

29:47.066 --> 29:49.639
Two... whatever the fish is today, two of those.

29:49.690 --> 29:50.883
And you still like iced tea?

29:51.487 --> 29:52.112
I do.

29:52.481 --> 29:54.282
And two of those,
too, please.

29:54.402 --> 29:55.014
Thanks.

29:56.852 --> 29:57.452
So.

30:00.570 --> 30:03.157
Were you as stunned as I was that we ran into each other the other night?

30:03.847 --> 30:04.846
Yeah, I was pretty stunned.

30:06.425 --> 30:07.485
She's lovely, your wife.

30:07.999 --> 30:10.244
Thank you. She came to me that way, actually.

30:10.295 --> 30:11.589
I had nothing to do with it.

30:13.224 --> 30:14.361
Steve seems nice.

30:14.612 --> 30:17.003
He is. Nice. Very.

30:20.141 --> 30:21.212
Do you believe in fate?

30:22.697 --> 30:23.900
It's funny you should say that.

30:23.951 --> 30:25.075
I didn't used to,

30:25.557 --> 30:28.108
but since I got out of school...

30:28.159 --> 30:29.529
well, since I've been married, really...

30:29.580 --> 30:30.704
Well, here's the thing.

30:32.430 --> 30:36.458
For the past few years or so I, I've had this, um...

30:37.644 --> 30:39.952
It's like a hollow inside me,

30:41.242 --> 30:42.858
and I've been trying to figure out how to fill it.

30:43.408 --> 30:45.146
what it is and what to do with it,

30:47.621 --> 30:49.206
and just last week I realized what it was.

30:52.062 --> 30:52.804
I'm smart.

30:53.210 --> 30:54.601
Not that Steve isn't, but...

30:54.945 --> 30:56.122
You know, selling houses.

30:56.173 --> 30:56.864
I don't know.

30:57.206 --> 30:58.470
It's not quantum physics.

30:59.283 --> 31:00.463
It's not any type of physics.

31:02.885 --> 31:05.265
So now you're supposed to say, "Everything's physics".

31:08.179 --> 31:09.303
Everything's physics.

31:10.913 --> 31:13.944
Anyway, then I ran into you,
that's the fate part.

31:15.016 --> 31:15.987
You lost me, Karen.

31:17.701 --> 31:18.878
I want to start working again.

31:19.958 --> 31:21.686
I want to be an engineer, I want to use...

31:22.196 --> 31:25.095
my head for something more than calculating mortgage rates.

31:25.343 --> 31:26.280
Aha.

31:26.781 --> 31:29.598
Steve and I are thinking of moving the business here.

31:29.870 --> 31:31.084
His parents are getting older.

31:31.381 --> 31:32.549
He'd like to be closer.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.266
Sure.

31:33.694 --> 31:34.668
Funny thing is...

31:36.228 --> 31:38.178
There happens to be a job opening

31:38.844 --> 31:41.850
at your company that I think I might be right for.

31:42.050 --> 31:42.771
Oh, really? Wow.

31:42.822 --> 31:44.273
That's, um, that's great.

31:44.324 --> 31:45.202
So, um...

31:45.671 --> 31:47.959
I was hoping, as long as you're comfortable with it,

31:48.657 --> 31:49.867
you'd put in a good word for me.

31:51.218 --> 31:54.110
Assistant vice-president of systems sales and marketing.

31:54.850 --> 31:57.440
It says here that they're looking for a masters in engineering.

31:57.737 --> 31:58.816
I know, and I never get mine.

31:58.867 --> 32:00.987
which is stupid because I have a1most all the credits,

32:01.542 --> 32:05.295
but I was kind of hoping that my experience in business would make up for it.

32:06.187 --> 32:06.898
And,

32:07.711 --> 32:09.137
well, your going to bat for me.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.775
Right. Um...

32:12.149 --> 32:13.779
The thing is, they're looking for somebody with a masters.

32:14.099 --> 32:14.998
I know, but...

32:15.049 --> 32:17.425
Clients want to feel like they're dealing with someone who

32:17.528 --> 32:19.313
understands what it is that we're selling.

32:19.364 --> 32:21.088
I get that, I do,

32:21.738 --> 32:22.999
but I'm a closer, Joe.

32:23.363 --> 32:24.338
You get me in that room,

32:24.389 --> 32:27.451
and I will show them that I have the perfect résumé for this job.

32:27.606 --> 32:28.830
Look, um...

32:29.036 --> 32:31.006
I know how management thinks around here.

32:31.057 --> 32:32.802
If they say they're looking for a certain degree,

32:32.907 --> 32:34.789
you got to walk in that room with that diploma.

32:34.840 --> 32:35.737
It's that simple.

32:35.975 --> 32:38.150
But even if someone like you weighs in on my behalf,

32:38.757 --> 32:39.851
don't you think they'll meet me?

32:40.195 --> 32:41.634
I don't know.

32:42.030 --> 32:43.308
Isn't it at least worth a try?

32:48.384 --> 32:51.319
I mean...how fantastic would that be,

32:52.097 --> 32:53.425
working together again,

32:53.889 --> 32:54.973
rubbing elbows,

32:55.604 --> 32:56.659
pulling all-nighters.

33:03.718 --> 33:04.859
What are you doing, Karen?

33:06.021 --> 33:06.986
I'm closing, Joe.

33:08.285 --> 33:09.339
I'm closing...

33:11.302 --> 33:12.178
Well, stop.

33:15.281 --> 33:20.456
Look, I am flattered by your proposal, both proposals,

33:21.701 --> 33:24.983
but frankly, you're not qualified for either position.

33:27.276 --> 33:30.888
The first one is clearly way above your head educationally,

33:31.912 --> 33:35.703
and the second one is permanently filled
by someone who knows more about physics

33:35.858 --> 33:37.174
than you and me combined.

33:47.047 --> 33:48.447
Enjoy your fish.

34:05.992 --> 34:07.052
Mr. Morton?

34:07.179 --> 34:09.158
It's Allison Dubois from the district attorney's office.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.081
May I come in?

34:12.605 --> 34:14.605
Sure, I guess.

34:23.054 --> 34:24.815
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had a visitor.

34:25.690 --> 34:26.735
Can I help you?

34:27.802 --> 34:30.627
If you're here about the accident,
somebody already spoke with him.

34:31.510 --> 34:32.647
No, no, no, that's not why I'm here.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.864
I'm not here to take a statement, really. I...

34:35.891 --> 34:37.668
I wanted to ask you a question.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.172
I'm sorry, you are...?

34:42.606 --> 34:43.610
Catherine Croshaw.

34:44.803 --> 34:47.373
I'm Mr. Morton's case advisor at the employment office.

34:50.139 --> 34:51.266
Have we met before?

34:52.958 --> 34:54.512
No, not exactly.

34:56.516 --> 34:57.256
I can come back.

34:57.866 --> 35:00.259
That's okay. I only have about five minutes left on my parking meter.

35:01.793 --> 35:03.546
Yeah, you'd better get home and feed that cat.

35:05.429 --> 35:06.173
Clyde...

35:06.372 --> 35:07.159
Cathy,

35:07.369 --> 35:08.515
come on,
enough of that.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.879
This woman doesn't care about our business.

35:11.457 --> 35:12.914
I just woke up from a coma.

35:13.489 --> 35:15.853
Damn, girl, get over here and give me a proper kiss.

35:21.184 --> 35:21.929
I love you.

35:22.322 --> 35:23.198
I love you, too.

35:24.303 --> 35:25.631
Call me when you get home from the gym.

35:25.896 --> 35:27.450
Mm, think I'll skip the gym today.

35:28.072 --> 35:29.026
I just want to take a shower.

35:35.398 --> 35:36.997
- See ya.
- Nice to meet you.

35:40.767 --> 35:41.911
She seems nice.

35:44.011 --> 35:47.133
Yeah. She's going through a, uh, tough time right now.

35:48.257 --> 35:50.752
The guy she's divorcing is crazy.

35:51.729 --> 35:52.566
Nuts.

35:53.131 --> 35:54.162
I'm sorry.

35:55.617 --> 35:58.258
Yeah, he's one of those...

35:58.974 --> 35:59.911
Hey.

36:00.632 --> 36:02.356
Oh, no, get-get him out of here!

36:02.407 --> 36:04.482
- Nurse!
- What's the problem? Did I do something?

36:04.693 --> 36:06.003
Get him out of here!

36:06.144 --> 36:08.067
He's the reason I'm in this hospital, okay?

36:08.194 --> 36:08.934
Nurse!

36:09.040 --> 36:11.047
- He's a police officer.
- Get him out of here, all right.

36:11.098 --> 36:13.193
- I'm supposed to be safe in here!
- This is Detective Lee Scanlon.

36:13.244 --> 36:14.290
- What?
- He's with me.

36:16.816 --> 36:18.075
You're not Cathy's ex?

36:18.437 --> 36:20.556
I'm not anybody's ex and damn proud of it.

36:20.704 --> 36:22.427
Wait a second.
Who did you think he was?

36:23.409 --> 36:24.568
You were never married to Cathy?

36:24.984 --> 36:26.161
Is that the lady I just passed in the hall?

36:26.212 --> 36:27.664
I don't even know who Cathy is.

36:28.700 --> 36:31.912
Is that why you took off on me yesterday?
You thought I was...

36:32.897 --> 36:33.645
her husband?

36:34.103 --> 36:34.918
Her ex-husband.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.065
He put her in the hospital last year.

36:40.141 --> 36:41.507
I'm sorry.
I guess I was wrong.

36:43.170 --> 36:47.538
He told me that he knew where I lived and that he's been driving by my house.

36:51.185 --> 36:52.491
Can I talk to you outside?

36:56.839 --> 36:58.926
It wasn't Clyde.
It was never going to be Clyde.

36:59.201 --> 37:00.151
What was never going to be Clyde?

37:00.320 --> 37:02.715
He was never gonna to kill her.
He was just gonna be accused of it.

37:03.312 --> 37:03.912
Okay.

37:04.001 --> 37:06.469
His fingerprints,
his DNA is probably all over her house.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.478
They would have found her body,
looked at his record,

37:08.529 --> 37:10.134
figured it was an open and shut case.

37:10.185 --> 37:11.200
What was an open and shut case?

37:11.350 --> 37:12.609
- Her murder.
- Whose murder?

37:12.660 --> 37:13.439
Cathy.

37:13.501 --> 37:15.194
The Cathy I just saw walking down the hall?

37:15.245 --> 37:17.367
I hate to be the bearer of good news,
but she's not dead.

37:17.453 --> 37:19.817
No, but she was going to be before Clyde got hit.

37:20.019 --> 37:21.669
- But now she's not...
- No.

37:23.337 --> 37:24.182
Yes.

37:25.193 --> 37:28.407
Oh, my God, she was wearing the same clothes that she was wearing in my dream.

37:29.659 --> 37:30.492
It's tonight.

37:31.465 --> 37:32.150
Lee,

37:32.629 --> 37:33.873
it's gonna happen tonight.

37:36.236 --> 37:37.401
No, I didn't make it to the gym.

37:37.654 --> 37:39.024
I had to do something after work.

37:42.483 --> 37:44.512
Nothing. I'm fine.

37:45.289 --> 37:46.600
Just a little beat, that's all.

37:48.733 --> 37:49.514
No.

37:53.502 --> 37:55.841
Damn, I left the window open this morning.

37:55.945 --> 37:57.497
The cat's gonna have gotten out.

38:00.144 --> 38:02.045
Really, I'm fine.

38:03.430 --> 38:04.129
It's just,

38:04.723 --> 38:07.965
something happened today to somebody that I'm kind of bummed out about.

38:10.469 --> 38:12.569
Titu? Here, boy.

38:12.811 --> 38:13.557
Titu?

38:14.574 --> 38:16.329
I'll tell you some other time,
okay?

38:17.173 --> 38:18.620
I just want to take a shower,

38:19.240 --> 38:21.192
watch TV and veg.

38:21.811 --> 38:22.478
Titu.

38:24.431 --> 38:25.211
Titu?

38:27.804 --> 38:29.119
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

38:30.832 --> 38:31.605
You, too.

38:32.843 --> 38:33.468
Bye.

38:42.791 --> 38:44.950
You ever play rock, scissors,
and paper, Mr. Croshaw?

38:45.859 --> 38:46.925
This is just like that,

38:47.078 --> 38:48.915
except it's called knife,
gun...

38:49.664 --> 38:50.835
You're dead.

38:52.212 --> 38:53.816
Mommy!

38:54.143 --> 38:54.969
It's him!

38:55.145 --> 38:56.071
Who?

38:57.285 --> 38:58.132
Him!

38:59.909 --> 39:00.606
Hello?

39:01.173 --> 39:01.941
Good morning.

39:02.439 --> 39:04.271
Good morning,
Mr. District Attorney.

39:05.658 --> 39:08.094
"Mr. District Attorney"?
Wow, that bad, huh?

39:08.942 --> 39:12.549
Well, I guess you had every reason to be angry.

39:13.226 --> 39:13.957
Did I?

39:15.852 --> 39:19.745
Turns out you saved the woman's life
and kept an innocent man from going to jail.

39:20.261 --> 39:22.332
So does that mean I ought to send out my résumé?

39:23.419 --> 39:26.166
Allison, as long as I have a job, you have a job.

39:27.376 --> 39:30.033
By the way, you wouldn't have
any inside information on that, would you?

39:30.452 --> 39:32.306
Sir, clearly I'm not the person to ask.

39:32.366 --> 39:34.849
I am the one who saw Bradley standing behind your desk,

39:34.900 --> 39:36.096
but well...

39:37.263 --> 39:40.343
for what it's worth,
I do have a good feeling about tomorrow.

39:41.375 --> 39:42.130
Me, too.

39:44.657 --> 39:46.986
Things are gonna be different under my watch, Mr. Mayor.

39:47.557 --> 39:48.301
Trust me.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.257
I'm not afraid to knock a few heads from time to time.

39:54.855 --> 39:58.910
No, I'm just... I just stopped Manny Devalos' heart, I think.

39:59.553 --> 40:00.982
No, it's his office I'm in.

40:01.201 --> 40:03.078
He's the only guy around here working at this hour.

40:03.410 --> 40:06.567
So, when I realized that I'd forgotten my keys and my cell phone,

40:06.618 --> 40:07.795
I almost locked out of my office.

40:07.846 --> 40:09.992
I didn't know who else to ask for help.

40:10.043 --> 40:11.523
So thank you for running them over here,

40:11.574 --> 40:15.104
and I will be standing in the lobby. Yeah.

40:17.180 --> 40:17.903
wife.

40:20.175 --> 40:21.161
And...

40:22.787 --> 40:24.453
She thinks I ought to concede as well.

40:25.198 --> 40:26.459
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

40:26.810 --> 40:28.495
If it were me,
I'd ride it out.

40:29.512 --> 40:31.033
As a wise man once said,

40:31.880 --> 40:33.719
"You can't have too much democracy".

40:36.065 --> 40:37.177
Thank you, Manuel.

40:37.962 --> 40:39.280
I will see you on TV tomorrow.

40:39.799 --> 40:40.619
You, too.

40:42.903 --> 40:43.708
Hey, listen,

40:43.759 --> 40:46.950
if you see an exterminator looking lost out there will you point him this way?

40:47.001 --> 40:49.884
He's supposed to do a big number on my office today.

40:50.904 --> 40:51.845
Consider it done.

40:58.397 --> 41:01.782
Oh, my gosh, with everything on,
I completely forgot to ask you.

41:01.833 --> 41:02.887
How was your lunch yesterday?

41:04.620 --> 41:05.579
Didn't happen.

41:06.894 --> 41:09.171
What? You're kidding!
She stood you up?

41:10.616 --> 41:11.585
Actually, uh...

41:12.625 --> 41:13.611
I did the standing up.

41:14.884 --> 41:15.640
You did?

41:17.663 --> 41:19.319
You did?

41:20.182 --> 41:21.016
I don't know.

41:21.969 --> 41:25.465
What's the point of going out for a 
hamburger when you have steak at home?

41:28.441 --> 41:30.717
I'm taking the kids to school.
I'll call you from work.

41:32.755 --> 41:35.664
That's so funny.
I was sure you'd ordered the fish.

41:51.771 --> 41:55.978
