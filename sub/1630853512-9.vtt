WEBVTT

00:06.107 --> 00:08.142
*

00:13.814 --> 00:16.350
I took care of Paula
like you asked.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.987
And these...

00:20.121 --> 00:22.790
are the people
that she sent to set you up.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.294
We ID'd 'em.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.930
Darnell James.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.635
And Murphy Mason.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.874
MAN:
Find them.

00:41.942 --> 00:44.011
*

01:02.029 --> 01:04.232
That was... um...

01:05.866 --> 01:07.401
That was nice.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.637
Nice?

01:10.538 --> 01:13.574
I don't know. I wouldn't
describe that as being nice.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.344
(chuckles)

01:22.049 --> 01:23.984
(whispering): She's got, like,
a chip missing or something.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.055
(laughs softly)

01:28.189 --> 01:30.224
(sighs)

01:30.358 --> 01:32.092
Maybe I have a chip missing,
too.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.699
Who are you talking to?

01:38.832 --> 01:40.934
Uh, what? No one.

01:41.068 --> 01:44.238
Oh, I thought I heard... Huh.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.773
(Max sighs)

01:45.906 --> 01:48.075
(clears throat)

01:48.209 --> 01:50.043
Yeah, anyway, it's, uh, late.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.112
I should go to bed.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.248
(sighs)

01:54.382 --> 01:56.184
Aren't you bored of this?

01:56.284 --> 01:58.419
Of what?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.288
This.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.424
I need you
to be a little more specific.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.427
You are riddled with secrets.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.061
Riddled with secrets?

02:08.196 --> 02:10.063
Yeah.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.366
What are you doing here, Murph?

02:12.466 --> 02:16.204
In this motel? Alone?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.739
Shutting out
everyone you care about?

02:18.872 --> 02:20.274
I told you I needed some space.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.310
(laughing):
Okay.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.577
Okay.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.413
Yeah. Whatever.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.949
You might not be bored of this,
but I sure as hell am.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.285
Okay, well, I'll see you later.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.422
(Max sighs, sniffles)

02:36.724 --> 02:38.759
(chuckles)

02:38.892 --> 02:40.994
We have two options here.
Oh, great.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.297
An ultimatum.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.832
We are either going
to be together,

02:44.965 --> 02:47.935
like, for real,

02:48.068 --> 02:50.604
or I walk out that door,
and that's it.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.773
You're not ever gonna
see me again.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.676
Yeah, I've heard that before.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.746
This isn't... I'm serious.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.648
I have to start
taking care of myself.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.351
I can't keep...

03:03.484 --> 03:05.486
That's where I'm at.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.488
And I really do mean it
this time.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.856
You really mean it
this time?
Yes.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.157
You mean it?
Yeah, I mean it.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.625
Mm-hmm.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.627
Look, I don't care
that you're messed up.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.195
So am I.
(scoffs)

03:15.329 --> 03:17.698
And I get there's been a lot
of damage here.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.301
But I'll stay in this motel
and hash it out all night,

03:20.434 --> 03:22.102
multiple nights,
whatever it takes,

03:22.202 --> 03:26.507
but I need you
to want that, want... me.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.711
So?

03:31.779 --> 03:34.147
What's it gonna be?
This is a joke.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.649
You can't give me an ultimatum.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.785
Pretty sure I just did.
Are you 12 years old?

03:37.885 --> 03:39.853
If you can't even tell me
you want to try

03:39.987 --> 03:41.622
and make this work,
I mean, what the hell

03:41.722 --> 03:44.358
am I doing here?
I don't know.
I didn't invite you.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.360
You-you begged me
to leave Lesley.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.562
You-you-you...
you begged.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.564
And here I am, and...
and you don't even care.

03:50.698 --> 03:54.134
I didn't beg you to leave
Lesley. I didn't beg.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.869
Okay.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.073
I got my answer. I'm done.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.380
Fine. Be done.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.222
Take care of yourself, Murph.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.895
Wait, wait, wait.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.231
What?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.600
(sighs)

04:26.734 --> 04:29.036
Don't go.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.575
If you want to...

04:34.708 --> 04:37.611
If you want to hash it out,
then...

04:37.745 --> 04:40.414
Then fine. Let's hash it out.

04:40.548 --> 04:43.016
(sniffles)

04:43.116 --> 04:45.753
(sighs)
So you want
to make this work?

04:45.886 --> 04:47.888
I want to at least try.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.629
All right.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.610
(sighs, sniffles)

05:09.743 --> 05:11.945
We need to be brutally
honest with each other.

05:12.079 --> 05:15.115
Just get it all out. I mean,

05:15.248 --> 05:17.217
all our problems are
because we don't talk.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.887
I don't-- I don't-- I don't
even know where to start, Max.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.822
There's just a lot.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.458
There's been a lot.
Yeah, I know.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.260
We can start by you telling me

05:27.395 --> 05:29.096
what you're doing
in this motel room.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.266
I told you, I needed space.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.103
I needed some alone time.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.138
Murphy, stop. Come on.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.774
(phone buzzing)
I...

05:40.908 --> 05:42.443
Oh, hang on.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.578
Seriously?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.580
Are you seriously gonna
answer that right now?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.081
Just give me a second. God.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.783
(sighs)

05:49.917 --> 05:53.454
Hello? Hey, just-just
hold on a second.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.958
One sec.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.833
Okay, here I am.
What did... what did Sarah say?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.468
Her team stayed at the warehouse

06:07.601 --> 06:10.270
and checked security cam
footage inside and outside.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.040
No one even drove by.
They didn't send anyone.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.942
That's so weird.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.644
I wonder-wonder
if they knew it was a setup.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.879
Maybe.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.948
There's-there's no way
they're onto us, though, right?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.683
Like, they don't-- they don't
know who-who you and me are?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.217
I don't think so.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.786
No one showed up at the meeting,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.355
and I texted the dude
from Paula's phone. Plus,

06:28.489 --> 06:30.123
there's the fact
that we're alive.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.860
Yeah. Yeah, right.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.795
Tried to explain that to Sarah,

06:34.895 --> 06:37.297
but she still freaked,
and had CPD get me

06:37.397 --> 06:38.532
a motel room just in case.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.367
Oh, wow.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.170
So I'm at the Hedgeworth a
few blocks down if you need me.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.639
But we should probably stay put.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.142
Okay. Um, what is--
what is our plan?

06:49.242 --> 06:50.678
Do we have any leads?

06:50.811 --> 06:53.146
They just want us
to lay low for a few days.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.650
We're gonna get him.
We have to.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.719
I know we will.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.387
Okay.
Good night.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.155
Okay. Bye.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.663
(sighs)

07:12.833 --> 07:14.401
Who was that?

07:15.402 --> 07:16.704
My mom.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.506
Hmm.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.073
You're not gonna
tell me what's going on?

07:20.207 --> 07:21.542
I-I think
we have bigger problems.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.744
Actually, we don't.
We actually do.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.246
How can we even try to start
over if you won't even tell me

07:26.379 --> 07:28.749
what you're doing in this motel,
or who that is on the phone?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.718
I told you, it was my mom.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.754
Let me see it then.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.756
No.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.125
Murphy, let me see the phone.
Let me see the phone.
Stop it.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.727
Let me see-- Give me the phone.
Dude, God. Stop.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.763
See the-- Mur-Murphy,
give me the phone.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.269
Darnell?

07:49.402 --> 07:52.105
What the hell are you talking
to Darnell about?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.816
Murphy?

08:02.950 --> 08:05.218
Just please give me
my phone. Give it to me.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.820
So you and Darnell are...

08:06.954 --> 08:08.889
(laughing):
Okay.
No.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.323
I swear to God.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.725
Then why didn't you just
tell me it was him?

08:11.825 --> 08:15.328
Because. Because...

08:15.462 --> 08:17.264
Just-just trust me.

08:17.397 --> 08:18.498
Trust you?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.067
Yes.
You literally

08:20.167 --> 08:21.268
just lied to me about
who was on the phone.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.502
I know I did, but...
(chirp)

08:22.636 --> 08:24.638
What was that?

08:24.772 --> 08:26.406
Nice deflection.
How did you not hear that?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.008
Hear what?
(chirp)

08:28.141 --> 08:29.810
That.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.478
Uh, it's probably
a smoke detector

08:31.612 --> 08:33.581
from another room
or something.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.515
No. It's coming
from in here.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.085
So?
So, it's-it's annoying.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.320
So is you avoiding my question.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.289
Look, I have my reasons, okay?

08:42.422 --> 08:43.757
And what are you they?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.026
Oh, my God.
What are they?!

08:46.159 --> 08:48.796
You, okay? You.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.931
Because if anything ever
happened to you, I...

08:51.031 --> 08:53.266
I'd never forgive myself, okay?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.469
(chirp)
So just drop it!

08:56.604 --> 08:59.106
I don't need you
to protect me.
(sighs)

08:59.206 --> 09:03.777
Murphy, I can take a lot,
but this cagey, condescending...

09:03.877 --> 09:07.314
I hate that you act
like I can't handle myself.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.316
Look, I-I already know
that you're probably

09:09.449 --> 09:11.819
dealing again or whatever,
so just tell me.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.386
I'm not.
(chirp)

09:13.520 --> 09:14.855
Okay.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.223
I'm not!

09:16.356 --> 09:19.727
Whatever. I'm gonna go then.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.329
(scoffs) Cool. I thought we were
gonna hash it out all night.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.331
Not if you're just gonna
stand there and lie to me!

09:24.464 --> 09:26.533
I'm not lying to you!
I'm just not telling you

09:26.667 --> 09:28.902
every single little thing
about my life!

09:30.003 --> 09:31.504
Keep telling yourself that,
Murph.

09:31.639 --> 09:34.341
(door opens)
Fine!

09:34.474 --> 09:36.476
God. Fine. (sighs)

09:36.576 --> 09:38.545
I'll tell you.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.219
I made a deal with Gene.

09:48.188 --> 09:52.525
And I'm sort of working
with the cops and with Darnell.

09:53.827 --> 09:57.397
We're helping take down
this big drug organization.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.736
So you're a CI?

10:04.537 --> 10:06.840
Yeah.
(scoffs)

10:06.940 --> 10:09.242
(chirp)
Wait.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.745
Where is that coming from?

10:11.879 --> 10:14.414
You're a CI?
And do you have any idea

10:14.547 --> 10:15.716
how dangerous this is?

10:15.849 --> 10:17.751
No, Max. Please enlighten me.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.252
How did this even happen?

10:19.386 --> 10:22.089
I was ready to go to prison.
I was.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.359
Look,

10:26.459 --> 10:29.296
Chloe was lying there

10:29.429 --> 10:31.631
in this hospital bed.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.735
And I figured, if I can take
down whoever did this to her

10:34.868 --> 10:38.806
and get my freedom
in one fell swoop, then...

10:38.939 --> 10:41.074
Oh, my God, Murphy.
Are you out of your mind?

10:41.208 --> 10:44.644
You think you could take down
a drug organization?

10:44.778 --> 10:46.413
I did it once.
Murph!

10:46.546 --> 10:48.749
I don't need you to protect me.
(laughs)

10:48.882 --> 10:50.583
(chirp)
I want to die.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.252
Well, you're in luck,

10:52.385 --> 10:53.586
because that is literally
what's gonna happen to you.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.588
Oh, my God,
this is why...

10:55.723 --> 10:57.557
This is why I didn't want
to tell you or Felix.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.460
I don't need you trying to be,
like, my hero or whatever.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.262
Okay? That's how you're gonna
get yourselves killed.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.496
I know what I'm doing.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.933
(scoffs)
Right.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.068
I do, Max. I do.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.103
I'm gonna get out of this mess.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.406
I'm gonna get revenge on the
person that did this to Chloe,

11:13.506 --> 11:16.409
and then I'm gonna be able
to have a life.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.112
Because if I pull this off,
I can actually be free.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.148
Free. No prison time, nothing.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.084
And if we sort...
whatever us out,

11:24.184 --> 11:27.154
isn't that
what you want?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.989
I want you alive.
I'm not gonna die.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.290
I promise, I'm not gonna die.
No, you c...

11:30.423 --> 11:34.594
No, you-you can't
promise that.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.696
I made it this far.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.299
Yeah?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.269
And who are these people
you're gonna try and take down?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.772
I'm not telling you.
Oh.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.473
I'm not telling you.
You're staying out of it.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.641
Okay, well,
if you insist on doing this,

11:48.776 --> 11:50.878
then at least let me help.
No!

11:51.011 --> 11:53.013
You are not helping.
(scoffs)

11:53.146 --> 11:54.647
No.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.617
(sighs heavily)

12:01.188 --> 12:03.891
(inhales sharply, exhales)

12:05.025 --> 12:06.827
And when is this gonna be over?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.361
Soon.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.563
Vague. Lovely.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.334
I don't have
all the answers.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.336
Yeah.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.840
Come on. Would you rather
I was having sex with Darnell?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.976
Sort of.
(scoffs)

12:23.076 --> 12:25.478
Shut up.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.186
If anything were
to happen to you...

12:33.320 --> 12:35.388
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.558
(chirp)

12:46.499 --> 12:47.567
Did you find anything?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.602
No.

12:49.736 --> 12:50.938
(chirp)

12:51.071 --> 12:52.505
God.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.076
Let's just... let's just
have sex or something.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.211
We can drown out the noise.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.448
I think we should...
work out our stuff first.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.951
(scoffs)
I mean,

13:04.084 --> 13:06.786
it's just that when we do that,
everything seems like it's okay.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.121
So?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.422
So, it's not okay.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.925
We're not okay.
Not to mention,

13:12.059 --> 13:13.426
you've effectively signed
your own death warrant

13:13.560 --> 13:14.794
and won't even
let me try to help.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.064
So we're not having sex?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.366
Murphy, please just
let me help you.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.769
No. No. We're not
talking about this.

13:22.903 --> 13:26.073
Okay? I'm doing it alone.
Period.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.610
I thought we were supposed
to be hashing out our issues.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.479
You don't think
this is an issue?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.581
We have a million other ones.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.624
Ugh. I don't even know
where to start.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.293
Well, this was
your brilliant plan.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.295
(laughs)

13:48.428 --> 13:50.931
Well, we love each other.
That we know.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.770
We love each other.

13:57.905 --> 14:02.409
I'm not entirely sure anymore.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.078
I don't know.
(laughs)

14:07.180 --> 14:10.150
You said brutal honesty.
It's what I'm trying to do.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.586
Yeah, well, forgive me for
thinking the baseline would be

14:13.686 --> 14:15.255
that we at least
love each other.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.990
I think you're forgetting
that I've been listening

14:17.124 --> 14:19.759
to you bone Lesley
every single day,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.095
which I'm sure
you can imagine was just a...

14:22.195 --> 14:23.530
a dream for me.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.998
Oh, this is ironic
coming from you.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.000
You've slept with everybody
that I know.

14:27.134 --> 14:30.003
Felix, Trey. I don't even want
to talk about Josh.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.505
You're threatened by Josh?
Oh, I'm... Oh, I'm sorry.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.974
Did you forget what happened?

14:34.107 --> 14:35.808
You chose him over me.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.810
Do you have any idea
what that felt like?

14:37.945 --> 14:39.980
I'd listen
to you have sex on a loop

14:40.113 --> 14:41.481
before ever living
through that again.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.951
I love how you think
that Josh is even

14:44.051 --> 14:47.220
remotely in the same ballpark
as Lesley.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.956
It's truly something.
Ah.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.358
Right, right.
Because Josh is worse?

14:51.491 --> 14:54.995
No. You started going out
with my best friend's sister.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.563
That's not okay!
It was unfortunate.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.631
It was calculated!
(scoffs)

14:58.731 --> 15:01.001
Max, just admit that you were
trying to get back at me.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.835
Lesley had nothing
to do with you.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.637
Oh, my God.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.673
Well, I'm just gonna go then

15:06.806 --> 15:09.209
if you're gonna
stand there and lie to me.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.311
You want to know
the truth?
Yeah, I sure do.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.513
I've never been
good enough, okay?

15:13.646 --> 15:17.184
Not smart enough.
I grew up dirt poor.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.553
I've lived in a shack, and I...
(sighs)

15:20.687 --> 15:22.222
And I was too embarrassed

15:22.355 --> 15:25.025
to tell anyone
which house was mine.

15:25.158 --> 15:29.229
Girls like Lesley
were untouchable.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.532
So when she gave me the time of
day-- I don't know-- I just...

15:32.665 --> 15:35.168
for the first time in my life,
I felt like

15:35.268 --> 15:38.838
maybe I was worth something.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.675
You didn't feel like you were
worth something with me?

15:44.577 --> 15:46.213
No.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.719
Well, then, it really sucks that
you blew things with Lesley.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.421
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.688
You know,

15:55.788 --> 15:57.124
they have websites for, uh,

15:57.257 --> 15:59.226
guys who are looking
for a sugar mama.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.528
(laughs)
You should look into that.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.196
Oh, my God.

16:03.296 --> 16:07.067
You're actually, like,
the perfect candidate, you know?

16:07.200 --> 16:10.637
You're tall,
you're really handsome, I hear.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.405
Some 60-year-old widow will just

16:12.539 --> 16:13.773
snatch you right up.
(snaps fingers)

16:13.906 --> 16:15.708
You could live
in her mansion.
Yeah.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.277
Could lounge by the pool,

16:17.410 --> 16:18.878
service her once a week.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.814
What do you think?
Yeah, that's not what this is...

16:21.948 --> 16:25.885
It was just nice to not feel
like a piece of trash for once.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.587
You have no idea
what that's like.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.622
Oh, you don't think I have
any idea what that's like?

16:29.756 --> 16:32.992
My own parents didn't want me.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.427
What are you talking about?

16:34.561 --> 16:35.828
You have the best parents
in the world.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.764
I'm obviously talking
about my birth parents,

16:37.897 --> 16:40.233
the ones who gave me up
when I was two years old.

16:41.234 --> 16:44.571
So, yeah, it really blows
that you-you grew up in a shack,

16:44.671 --> 16:46.106
but you want to know

16:46.239 --> 16:48.175
what feeling like trash
really is like?

16:48.308 --> 16:51.244
Try having the two people
who are supposed

16:51.344 --> 16:53.613
to love you more
than anyone else in the world

16:53.746 --> 16:56.683
fight their own
biological instincts

16:56.816 --> 16:58.985
just to not have
to deal with you.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.923
So don't talk to me
about feeling like trash.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.270
Maybe you should
just go look for them,

17:17.370 --> 17:19.206
try and find them.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.674
What?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.710
Your parents.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.045
Your biological ones.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.181
I mean, maybe that's why

17:28.315 --> 17:30.683
you're having such a hard time
connecting to anyone.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.387
That's your response?

17:34.521 --> 17:37.056
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.559
Yeah, well, I was
just trying to...

17:39.692 --> 17:42.229
Ugh. You're a joke.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.197
I was just trying to help.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.666
That's your problem.
You try to fix me.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.236
Stop trying
to fix me.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.404
I don't need you to fix me.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.507
Go fix yourself.
You're way more broken than me.

17:55.542 --> 17:59.078
The way you treat people
that love you is sociopathic.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.880
Sociopathic? Okay.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.849
Yeah, you're actually,
like, repelled

18:02.982 --> 18:04.884
by anyone
that cares about you.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.819
Well, maybe it's because
I hate myself.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.756
You ever think about that?!
I hate myself.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.224
You don't hate yourself.
Yes, I do.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.559
You love yourself.
You're the most

18:12.692 --> 18:14.026
narcissistic person
on the planet.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.562
Live a day in my head then.
Oh, I'd love to.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.497
You know what I'd do?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.732
I would flip all the switches
on in your stupid, little brain

18:19.866 --> 18:21.168
so you'd actually feel things

18:21.268 --> 18:23.603
like the rest of us!
God, you're so dramatic.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.538
And you know what the worst
thing about you is?

18:25.672 --> 18:28.241
No, but I can't wait.
You have zero desire

18:28.375 --> 18:31.611
to change. Zero.
You know what a dick you are,

18:31.744 --> 18:34.046
and you're completely okay
with it. And you don't care

18:34.181 --> 18:36.783
that you torture
everyone around you. Torture!

18:36.916 --> 18:38.885
You want to know what the
worst thing about you is?

18:39.018 --> 18:42.222
Let's hear it!
You are so starved for love

18:42.355 --> 18:44.791
that you'll cling to anyone
who gives you the time of day.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.226
You know that?

18:46.359 --> 18:47.860
You're like this desperate
little boy

18:47.960 --> 18:50.563
in search of Mommy's affection.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.200
So, yeah, maybe my problems
go back to my parents.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.568
But guess what.
So do yours.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.904
There is nothing unique here.

18:58.037 --> 19:02.575
(panting):
You... uh, you...

19:02.709 --> 19:05.912
You have somehow managed
to crawl into my skin

19:06.045 --> 19:08.147
like a disease.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.250
And you know
exactly which buttons to push,

19:10.383 --> 19:11.951
and-and you just do it.
You just do it for fun!

19:12.084 --> 19:13.253
Y-You're sick!

19:13.386 --> 19:14.887
(laughs)

19:14.987 --> 19:18.090
You know what's really sick?
Really, really sick?

19:18.225 --> 19:20.727
You know all of that, and yet,

19:20.827 --> 19:23.430
you're still here,
fighting for me, fighting

19:23.563 --> 19:25.398
for us.

19:25.498 --> 19:29.402
Searching
for his mommy's affection.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.574
I hate you!
(glass breaking)

19:34.674 --> 19:36.309
(laughs)
I hate you!

19:36.443 --> 19:40.313
Sure. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I do. Mm-hmm.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.148
Mm-hmm.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.454
* I make a resolution

19:47.587 --> 19:50.357
* Gonna leave the past behind *

19:50.490 --> 19:53.793
* I got a good feeling
(Murphy moaning)

19:53.926 --> 19:57.930
* That the future
will be mine, I feel alive. *

20:05.338 --> 20:07.774
(sighs)

20:07.874 --> 20:09.108
(chirp)

20:09.208 --> 20:11.944
Oh, my God.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.013
MURPHY: Ow!
MAX: Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.015
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Hey.
MURPHY: Oh, my God.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.717
Okay, hang on.
Hang on. Here.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.686
Oh, my God.
Look. I got you.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.488
Ow.
Okay. I know.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.856
I know. I know.
Ow!

20:23.990 --> 20:26.393
It's in my foot.
Okay. All right, here.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.627
Whoa. Ooh.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.362
Okay, okay.
Well, let me get it out.

20:29.496 --> 20:33.065
Ow!
Oh. Just hold still, okay?

20:33.199 --> 20:35.702
You're the one that had to throw
glass at me like a psycho.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.404
I did not throw it at you.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.039
(sighs)
But just... Okay.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.674
Stay right there, okay?
Just stay right there.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.476
Yes. I'm dying to move.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.012
(sighs)

20:46.145 --> 20:47.880
All right, here.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.482
(sighs)

20:53.653 --> 20:55.322
You okay?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.591
Yeah.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.092
Yeah?

21:03.863 --> 21:05.898
I'm sorry.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.235
Yeah. Me, too.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.438
(chirp)
Ugh.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.541
I looked in every single corner
of this place. Just ignore it.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.709
(chirp)
(sighs)

21:18.411 --> 21:20.747
Maybe we should just
ignore everything.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.915
Yeah, maybe.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.553
I do love you.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.122
You know that.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.728
You're the only person
that I've ever...

21:35.862 --> 21:38.398
that I've ever loved. I...

21:48.240 --> 21:50.242
(sniffles)

21:50.377 --> 21:54.313
Sometimes I feel like I'm, like,

21:54.447 --> 21:57.149
watching my life and...

21:57.283 --> 21:59.952
just, like, sabotaging it.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.822
I know what I should do,

22:02.955 --> 22:04.457
and I just do
the opposite.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.758
I knew

22:05.892 --> 22:08.127
I was destroying us.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.965
Completely aware,
every moment of it.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.570
I still did it.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.607
Yeah, I sort of knew that.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.775
You did?

22:22.909 --> 22:25.778
Yeah.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.280
(crying):
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.619
(sniffles)
I'm sorry.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.920
Come here.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.923
It's okay. Come here.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.128
(crying softly)

22:51.037 --> 22:52.939
Why do you love me?

22:53.039 --> 22:57.143
For some reason,
you just feel like home to me.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.879
So I'm like this rundown shack

23:00.012 --> 23:02.782
that somehow feels comforting
to you?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.784
(Max laughs)

23:04.884 --> 23:06.185
(both laugh softly)

23:06.318 --> 23:07.787
Yeah, something like that.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.889
(laughs, sniffles)

23:10.022 --> 23:11.891
(laughs)

23:12.024 --> 23:14.527
Oh.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.328
That's all I ever
wanted from you,

23:16.463 --> 23:18.364
you know?

23:18.498 --> 23:20.500
What is?

23:20.633 --> 23:22.735
For you to talk to me,

23:22.869 --> 23:25.137
open up.

23:25.237 --> 23:29.008
I don't know how to do this.
I don't...

23:29.141 --> 23:31.210
I don't know how
to really be with someone.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.714
Yeah, I don't know, either.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.018
But, like...

23:39.151 --> 23:40.820
What?

23:41.821 --> 23:43.255
Tell me.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.764
(sniffles)

23:51.898 --> 23:56.903
Maybe the reason that I...

23:57.036 --> 24:01.874
like, sab-- sabotage
everything is 'cause I'm...

24:02.008 --> 24:05.678
I'm just terrified that...

24:05.778 --> 24:10.416
that if you know me, like,

24:10.550 --> 24:12.685
if you really know me,

24:12.785 --> 24:15.121
that you'll run.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.959
And I just can't. I-I...

24:20.092 --> 24:22.962
(sighs)

24:24.897 --> 24:26.432
I can't.

24:26.566 --> 24:29.235
Come on, Murph.
I do know you.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.237
You don't.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.039
No one does.

24:33.139 --> 24:38.444
Well, no one
knows anyone really.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.781
(sniffles)

24:41.914 --> 24:44.551
But I'll spend my entire life
getting to know you.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.287
It's either that,
or spend my entire life

24:48.420 --> 24:50.757
trying to get over you.
(sniffles)

24:50.890 --> 24:53.660
But the first one sounds
a lot better to me. (laughs)

24:54.961 --> 24:57.096
It does?

24:57.229 --> 24:59.732
Come on.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.668
(sniffles)

25:02.969 --> 25:05.237
It's always been you.
I was just scared.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.576
(sniffles)
(laughs softly)

25:09.676 --> 25:12.078
What?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.080
Nothing.

25:14.180 --> 25:17.249
I just kind of felt
like an insane person.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.920
I knew you felt that way.
I knew.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.422
That's why I kept fighting.

25:24.957 --> 25:28.795
I mean, even when you were
impossible, I just knew.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.296
(sniffles)

25:30.429 --> 25:32.632
(clicks tongue)

25:32.765 --> 25:34.934
Hmm.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.705
We're both sort of, like...

25:38.838 --> 25:40.306
Disasters.
Yeah.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.808
Yup.
Yeah.

25:41.941 --> 25:45.712
But maybe...
maybe together, we can--

25:45.845 --> 25:48.681
I don't know-- be okay.
(sniffles)

25:48.815 --> 25:50.883
Maybe.

25:53.285 --> 25:57.056
I love that you're finally
realizing all this now,

25:57.189 --> 25:59.191
but I knew
you were it since day one.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.193
No, you did not.
I did. I...

26:01.327 --> 26:02.662
Oh, come on. Please.
I did.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.530
No, you did not. (sniffles)

26:04.664 --> 26:06.565
I did.
(laughs) Sure.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.735
Ugh.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.140
(laughs, sniffles)

26:15.975 --> 26:17.509
Hang on a sec.

26:17.644 --> 26:18.978
Where are you going?

26:19.078 --> 26:21.714
To grab something
from my car.

26:21.848 --> 26:23.249
(keys jingle)

26:26.318 --> 26:28.387
(traffic passing)

26:34.226 --> 26:36.162
(door opens)

26:36.262 --> 26:38.497
*
(door closes)

26:46.438 --> 26:49.241
I bought this
after our second date.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.778
It's not much, but I...

26:51.911 --> 26:56.282
But when I saw it,
I just knew it was yours.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.285
Anyway, even when I couldn't
buy myself dinner,

26:59.418 --> 27:01.788
I couldn't bring-bring myself
to sell it.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.223
Uh...
Oh, my God.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.726
Murphy?

27:06.859 --> 27:07.960
(laughing):
Shut up.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.561
Oh, look,
I-I know I'm not...

27:09.696 --> 27:11.597
I'm not really great
with my words or anything.

27:11.731 --> 27:12.932
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.566
And...

27:14.701 --> 27:16.135
and this isn't

27:16.268 --> 27:18.304
really the way that I...

27:18.437 --> 27:21.941
meant for this to happen, but...
Oh, my God.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.376
I just, um...
Oh, my God.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.245
* Together... *

27:26.378 --> 27:29.248
Marry me, okay?

27:29.381 --> 27:32.584
* Forever you and me *

27:32.719 --> 27:33.953
Okay.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.587
*

27:35.722 --> 27:37.589
* My memories... *

27:37.724 --> 27:39.125
Yeah?
(laughing):
Yeah.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.394
Yeah. (laughs)

27:43.562 --> 27:44.797
* Memories of laughter...

27:44.931 --> 27:47.166
Okay. Um...

27:47.299 --> 27:48.467
(laughing):
Oh.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.738
* Share this change *

27:51.838 --> 27:55.441
* That could be forever *

27:55.574 --> 27:56.843
* A lifetime spent... *

27:56.976 --> 27:58.677
It's so gorgeous. (laughs)

27:58.811 --> 28:01.580
(laughing):
You're an idiot.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.582
* Forever... *

28:03.682 --> 28:06.318
Apparently,
you're a bigger one.
Yeah.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.154
Come here.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.022
* It could be *

28:10.156 --> 28:12.291
* Forever you and me *

28:12.424 --> 28:14.460
Oh. Mmm.
(laughs)

28:15.828 --> 28:18.998
* Yeah.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.271
MAX:
(grunts) Okay.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.774
(laughs)
I'm not doing kids,
though. I'm not!

28:27.874 --> 28:29.275
We'll see.
No!

28:29.375 --> 28:31.143
Yeah.
(laughs)

28:31.277 --> 28:33.445
Look how cute you are.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.685
(Max sighs)

28:39.819 --> 28:43.022
Maybe we should go back to
Canada or Mexico or something.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.657
No.
No?

28:45.792 --> 28:47.827
No, I don't want to live
my life on the run like that.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.628
Look, I really think
that we should...

28:49.728 --> 28:52.164
Max, the one thing
you want is a normal life.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.666
Uh-huh.
And I'm gonna
give that to you.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.703
I just have to find this
boss, which I know I can,

28:57.837 --> 29:00.306
and then, I can
actually be free,

29:00.406 --> 29:01.673
and we can do
whatever we want.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.475
MAX:
Yeah, but nothing...

29:03.575 --> 29:05.311
MURPHY:
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.746
MAX:
It better not.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.583
Now please get out.
I have to pee.

29:11.717 --> 29:13.485
You're disgusting.
Yeah, well.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.321
Get out.
Well, there's a toilet
right here.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.589
There's a drain
right here.
Okay.

29:17.723 --> 29:20.059
All right.
Enjoy yourself.

29:20.192 --> 29:22.061
(groans)

29:22.194 --> 29:24.230
(laughs)

29:25.497 --> 29:27.533
*

29:38.577 --> 29:40.612
(phone buzzing)

29:48.754 --> 29:50.556
DARNELL:
Where are you?

29:50.689 --> 29:52.959
I'm at my motel. Why?

29:53.092 --> 29:54.360
They know who we are.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.694
What?

29:55.794 --> 29:58.030
I was just emailed pictures.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.767
What?

30:01.901 --> 30:03.602
They sent me pictures of us
in the warehouse.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.471
It's a threat.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.374
Yes, I know it's a threat.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.576
They're gonna kill us.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.778
It's over.
We got to get out.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.047
We need protection.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.721
DARNELL:
Hello?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.556
Yes, I'm here. I'm here.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.657
What are we gonna do?

30:25.791 --> 30:27.293
There's nothing to do.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.928
They know who we are.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.629
They obviously know
we're working with the cops.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.398
But isn't...? There's got
to be someone we can talk to.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.733
We can-- we need-- we can
tell them that Paula set us up,

30:34.833 --> 30:36.068
or we can tell 'em...

30:36.168 --> 30:37.503
That's not gonna work.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.338
What aren't you understanding?

30:39.471 --> 30:41.273
We're done.
MURPHY: No, but...

30:41.407 --> 30:43.075
No, my-my deal was

30:43.175 --> 30:44.944
I have to... I have
to find the head of Bolt,

30:45.077 --> 30:46.612
and I haven't done that yet.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.981
I have to find him,
and I have to get out of this.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.183
You can't, okay?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.185
We need to tell Sarah and Gene

30:53.319 --> 30:55.254
that we need protection,
and fast.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.455
But I'll go back to prison.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.690
The other option is death.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.961
Then I'll run.
They will find you, Murphy.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.595
Oh, my God.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.098
I have to get rid
of all the stuff

31:06.198 --> 31:07.533
that links us
to Trevor and Paula.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.101
Sarah can't find out...

31:09.201 --> 31:10.669
What stuff?

31:10.802 --> 31:13.172
The cell phones
and gun and everything.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.041
Once that's done,
I'll call Sarah

31:15.174 --> 31:16.608
and tell her
we need protection.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.647
Hello?

31:21.780 --> 31:25.384
Yeah. I'm here.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.386
I guess I'll just...

31:27.519 --> 31:29.221
I'll just talk to you in a bit.

31:29.355 --> 31:30.556
Okay.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.890
I'll call you.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.292
Just be careful.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.961
They apparently have eyes
everywhere.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.963
All we can do is hope they don't
know where we are yet.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.070
(sighs)

31:48.207 --> 31:50.242
(indistinct chatter on TV)

31:55.547 --> 31:57.516
You know what I miss?

31:57.649 --> 31:58.884
Channel surfing.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.087
(chirp)
No!

32:01.220 --> 32:03.089
For a minute,
I actually thought it was gone.

32:03.222 --> 32:04.423
(laughs)

32:04.556 --> 32:06.425
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.394
What?

32:08.527 --> 32:09.996
(chirp)

32:10.096 --> 32:12.431
Nothing. I just...
I thought it was gone, too.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.666
Hmm.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.935
But you-you know what I miss?

32:17.069 --> 32:19.605
Hmm?
Food. (laughs)

32:19.738 --> 32:21.673
I haven't eaten in forever.
I'm starving.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.875
I'm actually
pretty hungry, too.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.877
Let's get something delivered.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.880
It's 2:00 a.m. I don't think
anyone's gonna be delivering.

32:29.015 --> 32:31.950
Hmm. What about...?

32:32.084 --> 32:33.552
I'm kind of in the mood
for pizza.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.421
How about, um...
how about Basil?

32:35.554 --> 32:37.623
They're open all night.
It's all the way
across town.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.458
It just sounds so good.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.261
You want me to go out
and get it, don't you?

32:42.394 --> 32:43.795
I mean,
it is my engagement dinner.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.864
I feel like I deserve pizza

32:45.964 --> 32:49.101
for such a momentous occasion,
don't you?

32:49.235 --> 32:50.736
(chuckles softly)

32:50.869 --> 32:53.139
Ah.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.042
I do, and so I will
brave the elements

32:56.142 --> 32:58.710
and go get my fiancée
the pizza she requires.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.914
Thank you.
Yeah.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.051
(chirp)

33:05.151 --> 33:07.053
Will you take Pretzel with you?

33:07.153 --> 33:10.156
He's just... he's been cooped up
in here for, like, two days.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.490
Of course.

33:11.623 --> 33:12.958
Let's go. Come on.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.493
Oh, uh, pepperoni?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.762
(chirping continues)

33:17.763 --> 33:19.465
Duh. (laughs)

33:19.598 --> 33:21.900
I'll be back soon.
(door opens)

33:22.000 --> 33:23.969
I love you.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.239
Love you, too.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.345

33:46.592 --> 33:48.160
(phone beeps)

33:48.294 --> 33:51.097
Look up Task Champ Chicago.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.165
AUTOMATED VOICE: One result

Call.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.704
(line ringing)

33:58.837 --> 34:00.206
Task Champ. This is Cheryl.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.540
(chirp)

34:01.673 --> 34:03.809
This is Murphy Mason.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.445
I know your boss is looking for
me. Can I talk to him, please?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.714
Oh, um, he's not here,

34:08.847 --> 34:11.817
but let me patch you through
to his cell. One sec.

34:11.950 --> 34:12.884
(sighs)

34:13.018 --> 34:16.021
(line ringing)

34:16.155 --> 34:17.389
REGGIE:
Hello?

34:17.523 --> 34:18.957
Look, I don't know
what your deal is,

34:19.057 --> 34:20.058
but I know you're tracking me.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.993
I've been hearing it all night.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.830
So stop playing your little
mind games and just come inside.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.165
Inside where?

34:26.298 --> 34:27.833
You know where I am.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.335
So just come in and get me

34:29.468 --> 34:31.870
and kill me or whatever,
but do it now.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.872
Do it right now.
I'm begging you.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.874
Come now! Please!

34:36.007 --> 34:37.243
SIMON:
I got her location. Hang up.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.378
What?

34:39.511 --> 34:42.548
REGGIE:
Okay. See you soon, Murphy.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.920
(chirp)

34:49.888 --> 34:51.257
(panting)

34:55.827 --> 34:58.930

35:22.921 --> 35:25.391
TAMAGOTCHI:
Feed me. Feed me.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.725
(screaming)

35:26.858 --> 35:28.927
* If the sun should tumble *

35:29.060 --> 35:33.098
* From the sky *

35:33.232 --> 35:37.736
* If the sea should
suddenly run dry *

35:39.771 --> 35:44.142
* If you love me

35:44.276 --> 35:47.813
* Really love me *

35:47.946 --> 35:50.616
* Let it happen *

35:50.749 --> 35:54.453
* I won't care *

35:54.586 --> 35:56.755
* If it seems *

35:56.888 --> 36:01.159
* That everything is lost *

36:02.328 --> 36:08.900
* I will smile
and never count the cost *

36:09.000 --> 36:13.004
* If you love me *

36:13.138 --> 36:15.441
* Really love me *

36:15.574 --> 36:16.642
Hey!

36:16.775 --> 36:18.944
* Let it happen *

36:19.077 --> 36:20.779
* Darling *

36:20.912 --> 36:26.685
* I won't care *

36:26.818 --> 36:29.755
* Ah, ah, ah, ah. *

36:35.427 --> 36:36.328
(line ringing)
Come on.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.630
Pick up. Pick up.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.269
(line ringing)

36:50.276 --> 36:52.344
(phone buzzing)

37:01.653 --> 37:03.522
Where's your friend?

37:03.655 --> 37:05.056
What friend?

37:05.190 --> 37:06.825
(grunts)

37:06.958 --> 37:08.159
(gasps)

37:08.294 --> 37:12.698
You know what friend. Darnell.

37:12.831 --> 37:16.201
I'm telling you, I don't
know where he is. (groans)

37:16.335 --> 37:18.970
I swear to God, I don't know.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.972
Give me her phone.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.008
Don't touch me.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.210
Stop touching me.
(laughing)

37:25.344 --> 37:28.013
(Murphy panting)

37:28.146 --> 37:31.016
Darnell's number's right here.

37:31.149 --> 37:33.552
Can you trace it?
If he uses it.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.854
(panting)

37:35.987 --> 37:38.357
Call him. So call.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.091
Trace it.

37:40.225 --> 37:41.860
Do you think we're idiots?

37:41.993 --> 37:45.397
You'd just start screaming.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.999
And tell him to run.
(panting)

37:48.099 --> 37:50.168
REGGIE:
Anything?

37:50.268 --> 37:52.404
No.

37:52.538 --> 37:55.874
Oh, we should go.
He's expecting us.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.377
SIMON:
We can't show up
without the dude.

37:58.510 --> 38:01.112
Who's expecting us?

38:01.246 --> 38:02.948
Shut up.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.583
Your boss?

38:04.716 --> 38:06.785
I said, shut up!

38:06.918 --> 38:08.587
(groans)

38:08.720 --> 38:10.789
Ow!

38:12.023 --> 38:14.092
(bag splashes)

38:14.225 --> 38:16.227
(phone buzzing)

38:20.265 --> 38:21.800
Hey.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.869
MAX: What the hell, man?
I've been calling and calling.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.203
Hang on. I can hardly hear you.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.972
I'm out at the pier.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.407
Look, some dudes
just came and took Murphy.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.941
What?

38:30.075 --> 38:31.543
Oh, my God.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.312
Idiot picked up
his phone.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.147
REGGIE:
Where is he?

38:36.281 --> 38:38.249
SIMON:
Hang on.

38:38.384 --> 38:39.718
I-I left to pick up some stuff,
and I came back,

38:39.818 --> 38:40.986
and they threw her
in the back of a car.

38:41.119 --> 38:42.287
DARNELL:
Did you get a good look at them?

38:42.421 --> 38:43.622
No! It was just some dudes.

38:43.755 --> 38:44.990
Okay, look,
I'm gonna call the cops.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.792
Max, do not call the cops.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.660
These dudes will put a bullet
in Murphy's head.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.796
MAX:
Fine. Okay.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.734
DARNELL:
Just keep tailing 'em

38:55.834 --> 38:57.302
but make sure
they don't see you.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.438
MAX: I know, I know.
I'm not an idiot.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.842
Okay, got it.
We're only a few blocks away.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.944
Turn around.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.346
MAX:
Okay, they're-they're
turning around.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.681
I'm gonna T-bone 'em.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.349
DARNELL:
Max, do not!

39:11.483 --> 39:13.151
MAX: Well, then,
what am I supposed to do, huh?

39:13.284 --> 39:14.820
Just let them take her away
to God knows where?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.622
DARNELL:
Max, just don't.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.259
DARNELL:
I'm gonna call Sarah.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.662
MAX:
I thought you said no cops!

39:23.795 --> 39:24.763
She'll know what to do.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.933
Okay, fine, fine. Just call her.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.473
MAX:
Hey, D?

39:34.606 --> 39:35.807
DARNELL:
What?

39:35.941 --> 39:37.609
MAX:
Where'd you say you were?

39:37.709 --> 39:40.612
I'm at 63rd Street pier. Why?

39:40.712 --> 39:43.515
MAX:
Because they're here.

39:43.649 --> 39:44.983
(muffled):
No!

39:46.184 --> 39:48.887
(muffled groaning)

39:49.020 --> 39:52.524
No! (sighs)

39:54.192 --> 39:56.361
(panting)

40:00.231 --> 40:04.235
It's okay. It's okay.

(line ringing)

40:23.154 --> 40:25.190
(phone buzzing)

40:28.894 --> 40:30.929
Hello?

40:31.062 --> 40:32.764
What?

40:34.165 --> 40:35.433
Okay, okay, okay.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.869
Okay, slow down.
Y-Yes, I'm coming.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.838
I'm on my way. Just stay
on the phone with me.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.216
They just pulled up
to some club.

40:51.349 --> 40:52.918
How far away are you?

40:53.051 --> 40:55.120
I'm five away. I have a whole
undercover team en route.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.693
They're taking them inside.
I'm going in!

41:01.793 --> 41:04.563
No. Listen to me!
If you go in, you are dead,

41:04.696 --> 41:05.864
Murphy is dead, Darnell is dead.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.232
Look, I'm-I'm just...

41:07.365 --> 41:10.702
I know what I'm doing!
You don't.

41:10.802 --> 41:14.039
So just... do not step foot
out of your car, Max.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.607
Do you understand me?

41:15.741 --> 41:18.209
Fine! O-Okay.

41:26.484 --> 41:29.087
(hip-hop music playing faintly)

41:34.492 --> 41:36.595
They're here and clean.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.063
MAN:
Send them in.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.566
All right, let's go.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.734
(music continues over speakers)

41:52.978 --> 41:56.081
Hey, strangers.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.917

41:59.017 --> 42:01.687
Want to tell me
what you guys are up to?
