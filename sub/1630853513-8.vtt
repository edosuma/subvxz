WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:02.312
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:02.336 --> 00:03.687
What did you do with her?
She's been released.

00:03.711 --> 00:05.315
You said there was
a private security outfit

00:05.339 --> 00:07.150
that might be looking
for my sister.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.068
It's a family heirloom.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.070
Mom always said
it protected us from evil.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.780
Forrest is helping me organize
an open mic

00:12.804 --> 00:15.015
tomorrow at the Pony.
Hey, you should come by.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.786
I got a call about Cameron.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.123
Her car was impounded
just a couple hours away.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.566
I'm gonna look into it.
A friend might be in trouble.

00:37.788 --> 00:38.973
None of this is me.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.808
That's the point.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.144
You need a disguise so that
people will believe you're...

00:43.168 --> 00:45.438
you're... What, that I'm
cousin Rosalinda from Arizona.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.773
My mom married a minor league

00:46.797 --> 00:49.150
baseball player, but when
he got relocated to a team

00:49.174 --> 00:51.653
in Florida... Okay, you know what,
let's just go with, "They're dead."

00:51.677 --> 00:53.279
Oh, my gosh.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.156
Mm-hmm. I mean, you're asking me

00:55.180 --> 00:57.867
to wear a costume every day
for the rest of my life.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.535
Well, don't think of them
as clothes, you know,

00:59.559 --> 01:01.746
think of them as,
uh, possibilities.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.373
Dress for the life you want.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.792
So this little lady,

01:05.816 --> 01:07.794
she is the highest-earning
professional poker player

01:07.818 --> 01:09.379
in the Southwest. Wow.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.590
Ante up. Or this bad bitch,

01:12.614 --> 01:14.926
she makes party favors
for bachelorette parties.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.387
She can make literally
anything into a penis.

01:17.411 --> 01:21.599
Okay. Pick me.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.268
Think of it as a clean slate.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.186
Well...

01:28.505 --> 01:30.525
Surprisingly conservative.
Mm-hmm.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.695
How about that?

01:33.719 --> 01:35.446
This girl got super murdered

01:35.470 --> 01:38.491
and now she can't wear
what she wants ever again.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.599
But c'est la vie, right?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.561
There's just one last thing.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.557
Hey, that's really cool.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.559
That reminds me of Stephen
Powers before he sold out.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.602
Are you, like,
trying to impress me?

02:06.626 --> 02:10.565
Um... maybe,

02:10.589 --> 02:12.608
I guess. I mean,
I'm new in town.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.193
I'm just trying to be friendly.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.528
Where you from?

02:15.552 --> 02:18.656
Um... Oh, my God.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.617
She doesn't talk
like an illegal,

02:21.641 --> 02:23.620
but she def looks like one.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.538
Come on, guys.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.482
Millie's parents
are out of town anyways.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.961
That come with a frisk, Deputy?

03:15.445 --> 03:19.467
Ugh, go find a friend, Lindsey.
Come up with some goals.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.053
Well, Sangria Saturday
is a big hit.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.639
I am sorry to throw you to
the wolves on your first day.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.224
Oh, I appreciate the work.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.726
Turns out debt collectors don't
care if you've been half dead

03:28.750 --> 03:30.645
in a glowing pod
for a few months.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.146
Oh. Yeah.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.815
But just so you know...

03:33.839 --> 03:35.817
It's only temporary, I get it.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.318
Meanwhile, if there's
time to lean,

03:37.342 --> 03:40.053
there's time to...
Copy that, boss, on it.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.161
Those are definitely
not the right shoes

03:47.185 --> 03:51.290
for... whatever dance move
you're inventing.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.709
It's not a dance move.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.921
It's a summoning ritual.
I steal souls.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.174
What's your name, sorceress?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.885
Rosa... uh, linda.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.054
I'm from Arizona.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.182
Iris SÃ¡nchez...

04:08.206 --> 04:09.684
from Santa Fe.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.395
Well, look, if you're
looking for those kids

04:12.419 --> 04:16.023
who were here before, don't.
They were total dicks.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.944
Well, I wasn't really looking
for anyone in particular.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.029
I used to hang here as a kid.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.740
I was curious if it was still
the go-to chill spot

04:24.764 --> 04:26.993
for all the artsy weirdos.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.578
And I guess...

04:28.602 --> 04:30.121
I was right.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.873
What's your medium?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.024
I really just mess around.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.963
Hey, I'm hosting
this art show later.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.590
You should come.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.841
Icarus.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.510
That's the guy who flew
too close to the sun,

04:44.534 --> 04:46.119
right?

05:06.348 --> 05:08.910
I thought you were supposed
to be packing all this up

05:08.934 --> 05:10.953
and filling out grant
applications. Um,

05:10.977 --> 05:12.830
I-I am, and I will.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.374
After one last twirl
with your stolen centrifuge?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.210
Okay, I thought maybe
I could try to accelerate

05:17.234 --> 05:19.474
your heart's healing process.
Let me show you this slide.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.466
You feel that?

05:23.490 --> 05:26.677
You've done enough
for me in this, uh,

05:26.701 --> 05:29.847
dark little room. You deserve
a team of Stanford grads

05:29.871 --> 05:31.182
trying to keep up with you.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.059
You deserve awards
for discovering things

05:33.083 --> 05:34.685
that I can't even pronounce.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.004
I'm fine. Now just please
fill out your applications.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.902
Okay. I will pack it up,

05:42.926 --> 05:44.695
for real.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.156
You know, we can just maybe,
before you do,

05:47.180 --> 05:49.075
we could, uh... Uh-huh.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.539
What is it?

05:54.563 --> 05:56.332
I had Cameron's car
moved to the junkyard

05:56.356 --> 05:58.084
instead of the police impound.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.585
Let's do it. Liz...

05:59.609 --> 06:02.255
Ah, I coming with, and don't
you dare say I have to stay

06:02.279 --> 06:05.532
'cause it's "police business,"
you bar wench.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.056
To be clear,

06:12.080 --> 06:15.184
I would never interfere with
a police investigation.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.520
Well, paperwork mishaps happen.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.856
I don't pay you
to socialize, kid!

06:20.880 --> 06:23.150
You barely pay me
at all, Sanders!

06:23.174 --> 06:25.778
Well, wrap up the sewing circle,

06:25.802 --> 06:27.530
get to work.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.740
Should that guy even be driving?

06:29.764 --> 06:30.950
He can barely see.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.618
He introduced himself to me
the other day.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.287
I've been coming here
since I was 14.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.581
You got an hour to Nancy Drew
Cameron's car

06:36.605 --> 06:39.417
before I let Deputy Bob
know it's ready.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.043
Hey, you're not gonna help?

06:41.067 --> 06:44.714
Sanders is gonna
be gone all day.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.615
I'm going to the bar.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.471
What you doing? Hey.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.391
My mother said
that this necklace

06:55.415 --> 06:57.059
protects my family from evil.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.145
I put it on her a few months ago
when she got back

06:59.169 --> 07:00.730
from wherever she was.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.191
But I went to
see her this morning;

07:04.215 --> 07:06.110
She insisted that
I take it back.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.154
She said that
it's too late for her,

07:08.178 --> 07:09.655
and that I needed it more.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.241
I know this flower.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.993
Its pollen has a...

07:14.017 --> 07:17.604
paralytic effect
on alien abilities.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.149
Pick a card.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.613
Jack of spades.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.367
Two of hearts. Hmm.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.912
Nine of diamonds.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.600
Guerin,

07:37.624 --> 07:40.478
I think this necklace
is my kryptonite.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.563
When you were fixing
the clasp last year,

07:42.587 --> 07:44.899
my intuition
was through the roof.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.317
In the gala last year,

07:46.341 --> 07:49.028
when Noah invaded me,
I wasn't wearing the necklace.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.363
I was vulnerable to him.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.722
Kyle said you aren't an alien.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.560
Was Isobel pregnant this year?

07:59.145 --> 08:02.625
I wasn't wearing the necklace
at my Woman as Warrior class,

08:02.649 --> 08:05.461
and I swore I could
feel her fear and...

08:05.485 --> 08:07.612
heartache.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.847
You said you were 18 when your
mom started getting sick, right?

08:16.871 --> 08:19.475
She gave it to me as a gift
for my graduation.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.769
If this prevents you
from having more episodes,

08:21.793 --> 08:24.438
it probably stops the
neurodegeneration process, too.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.357
It's not kryptonite, Maria.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.508
This is preventative medicine.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.845
Keep it on.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.990
Well, no signs of a struggle.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.850
No damage to the car.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.438
It's dead.
I'll look for a charger.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.965
Can I help you, ma'am?

08:50.989 --> 08:52.591
Let's hope so.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.468
I'm Agent Powell.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.952
I'm looking for Max Evans.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.848
Um, you found him.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.058
Given your years on the force,
I'm sure you realize

09:01.082 --> 09:03.936
that tampering with a federal
investigation is a felony.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.273
You're gonna turn over this car,
along with any other evidence

09:07.297 --> 09:08.691
you might've gotten
your hands on.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.609
Forgive us for lacking faith

09:10.633 --> 09:12.153
in the criminal justice system.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.179
Liz, it's all right.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.908
It's best to just cooperate.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.435
Found this phone in the car.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.126
That's a nice piece,
but it's not government issue,

09:27.150 --> 09:28.419
and that car's a rental.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.654
I'm undercover. No, you're not.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.760
My sister,
she has the other half.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.496
You're Charlie.
Jenna Cameron's sister.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.986
Last time I talked to Jenna,
she said

09:54.010 --> 09:55.488
she'd been looking
for you for months.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.615
I didn't want to be found,
until my sister's name appeared

09:57.639 --> 09:59.241
on a missing persons database,

09:59.265 --> 10:02.453
and then I figured
a road trip was in order.

10:02.477 --> 10:05.271
You kept tabs on her.
She thought you hated her.

10:06.689 --> 10:10.377
I worked on a controversial
project a while back.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.755
A lot of dangerous people
want to know what I know.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.924
So you think they
took her to get to you?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.634
Doesn't that mean

10:16.658 --> 10:18.677
you're just playing
into their hands by coming here?

10:18.701 --> 10:21.746
And you'd back down
from a family fight?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.391
So who is it that's after you?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.060
It's a pretty long list.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.044
Oh, it finally charged up.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.566
Her last text

10:32.590 --> 10:36.386
was to "Alex Manes," asking
where she can find his dad.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.323
Wait, that's not
Jesse Manes, is it?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.283
You know him?
He's on that list of people

10:41.307 --> 10:43.101
who want to talk to me.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.771
Well, let's not
keep him waiting.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.794
Cowboys versus aliens,

10:51.818 --> 10:52.878
huh?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.088
What can I say?

10:54.112 --> 10:55.923
I'm just a guy standing in front

10:55.947 --> 10:57.800
of a tourist trap
asking a history buff

10:57.824 --> 10:59.677
to shoot him with
high-velocity paint.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.763
I'm surprised you reached out.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.266
Good surprised.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.892
Honestly, me, too.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.020
So, you cool with playing war?
Doesn't bring anything up?

11:10.044 --> 11:14.400
Oh, yeah, my PTSD triggers
are a little more complicated.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.569
Suffice to say, this war
zone is the only place

11:16.593 --> 11:18.946
that my family actually
got along when I was a kid.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.614
Yeah, some of my old
platoon buddies

11:20.638 --> 11:22.032
actually play in leagues.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.784
I didn't know you served.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.286
You know, I wouldn't
go bragging about it

11:25.310 --> 11:26.686
to a guy with a Purple Heart.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.206
I might've googled you.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.668
Let's make a wager.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.837
Loser buys the winner
a drink at Planet 7 tonight.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.822
Make it the Wild Pony
and you're on.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.723
Hey, girlfriend.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.100
Please don't tell me that Guerin
sent you here to convince me

11:48.124 --> 11:49.518
to take better care of myself.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.545
Wow. You really are a psychic.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.525
Look, if I had
a little lucky charm

11:56.549 --> 11:58.861
that could stop people like
Noah from messing with me,

11:58.885 --> 12:01.405
I would have that surgically
implanted into my dÃ©colletage.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.198
That's all I came here to say.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.577
It's not a joke, Maria.
This stuff is dangerous.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.955
Yeah, well, so is eating
a salad. E. Coli is everywhere.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.189
Okay.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.671
These abilities
are a part of me.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.423
I'm not gonna
just throw away the chance

12:19.447 --> 12:20.823
to learn about who I am.

12:22.992 --> 12:23.969
That make sense to you?

12:23.993 --> 12:27.163
Yeah. Actually, it does.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.601
You've gotten stronger
this year. Right?

12:30.625 --> 12:33.020
Can you teach me to train?
Learn how to control it all?

12:33.044 --> 12:35.022
Look, it took a lot of practice
before I could do anything

12:35.046 --> 12:37.983
without puking and guzzling
acetone to kill the pain.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.860
And you can't practice,

12:39.884 --> 12:42.154
because, according to
Kyle, every time you do,

12:42.178 --> 12:43.364
it eats your brain.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.366
Look, I'll stop
before it goes that far.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.825
Okay? I know the signs.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.037
Besides, if you help me,
maybe I can help you.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.189
There must be something that you
want to know about your future.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.861
What about my past?

13:04.158 --> 13:07.012
Afternoon, Master Sergeant.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.180
What's this?

13:08.204 --> 13:09.431
I know you were
expecting someone else,

13:09.455 --> 13:10.975
but Charlie Cameron
sent me instead.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.894
Come on, let's sit down.
I'll buy you a burger.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.774
My uncle used to bring me here.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.276
That was back when it catered
to a more civil clientele.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.988
People who actually respected
the history of this town.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.365
Well, if only someone would
make America great again.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.783
Here you go.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.993
I'll be back in a second.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.786
Tell me what you know
about Jenna Cameron.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.746
She's missing.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.747
Uh, the last time I saw her,

13:33.771 --> 13:36.000
she came to me with questions
about her sister.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.918
And I told her that

13:37.942 --> 13:40.963
the people most interested
in Charlie's device were

13:40.987 --> 13:44.008
a black ops group
based out of Los Alamos.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.342
They're called Deep Sky.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.368
This is their logo.
Paramilitary.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.808
And I told Jenna that...

13:52.832 --> 13:55.019
what she was getting into
was gonna be dangerous.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.711
But apparently,
she didn't listen.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.983
So what are
you working on right now?

14:01.007 --> 14:02.818
I, um, have big plans

14:02.842 --> 14:04.987
to scrub out the fryer
this weekend with my dad.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.448
Oh, God. Waitressing's
really got to blow

14:07.472 --> 14:09.283
when you've grown a fully
functioning heart muscle

14:09.307 --> 14:10.993
in a lab.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.747
Or are you not
the same Elizabeth Ortecho

14:14.771 --> 14:18.333
who coauthored a 2013 paper
on cellular reprogramming?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.962
Some people build model
trains; I do my homework.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.989
Your boyfriends seems
more like the train type.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.533
What is that supposed to mean?

14:29.368 --> 14:33.015
We've discovered new worlds and
changed the course of mankind

14:33.039 --> 14:35.059
from a microscope.

14:35.083 --> 14:39.897
Should I go Netflix and
chill with my boyfriend

14:39.921 --> 14:42.232
or stay in the lab,
architecting the future?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.109
No offense,

14:44.133 --> 14:46.779
but if it's true
that you've been in prison

14:46.803 --> 14:48.197
and in hiding, it does not seem

14:48.221 --> 14:51.015
like you've seen much
of the inside of a lab, either.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.162
I went too far.

14:55.186 --> 14:59.625
I thought that I was building
something with real value.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.752
The thing is, anything
that has the potential

15:01.776 --> 15:04.963
to create real change,
it scares people.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.800
And anything that scares people
is inherently dangerous,

15:07.824 --> 15:10.052
no matter what
your intention is.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.097
You could start over.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.892
Get a new identity,
work at a research university.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.977
I've done extraordinary things.

15:19.001 --> 15:23.357
Everything ordinary
is ruined now.

15:23.381 --> 15:27.069
Charlie Cameron's
mind is a unique specimen.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.403
Kind of like you.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.989
And there's always someone
in the shadows waiting

15:31.013 --> 15:32.157
to crack those open.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.492
What did you do to Jenna?

15:33.516 --> 15:35.160
I told her the truth.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.204
Which is more than you ever did.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.814
You're kind of a wolf
in sheep's clothing, aren't you?

15:40.606 --> 15:42.126
And what are you?

15:42.150 --> 15:43.776
Hmm?

15:45.236 --> 15:47.673
Do you feel like a hero?

15:47.697 --> 15:51.510
All those people you tortured,
all those people you killed.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.137
Turns out none of them
was an enemy.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.973
They were refugees.

15:55.997 --> 15:58.392
So you're not just a murderer,
you're a failure.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.043
Yeah, I know. I am.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.438
But I tell you,

16:03.462 --> 16:05.065
something shifted in my brain...

16:07.967 --> 16:09.194
when I had the stroke.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.113
All the hate's gone out of me.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.906
All the fight.

16:12.930 --> 16:18.245
Caulfield is over and my son
Flint has been reassigned.

16:18.269 --> 16:21.248
Look at me.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.107
I can barely walk.

16:25.276 --> 16:29.530
Uh, you know, I-I think
I'm gonna pass on the burger.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.414
And I hope you find Jenna.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.087
I always did like her.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.408
He said Cam is headed
to Los Alamos

16:56.432 --> 16:59.185
to investigate a group
called Deep Sky.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.290
Does that mean anything to you?

17:03.314 --> 17:04.790
No.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.251
Let me reach out to some
of my military contacts,

17:06.275 --> 17:08.002
do some recon.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.238
Give me a day,
we'll go from there.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.992
Think she's lying?

17:15.785 --> 17:17.554
I think she's scared.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.955
I got a few guys
I'm gonna call...

17:21.249 --> 17:25.186
from the reclined position
of my easy chair,

17:25.211 --> 17:27.814
letting my heart continue
to quietly heal.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.691
Bueno.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.297
Oh, man.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.840
You okay? Yeah.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.217
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you just...

17:55.241 --> 17:57.636
You got me in the leg
that does all the extra work.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.245
What do you mean?

18:01.747 --> 18:04.226
I'm so sorry. I-I had no idea.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.727
No, it's fine.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.021
It's not usually the story
that I lead with.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.089
Well, for future reference,
you totally should.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.651
Heroes are sexy.

18:19.181 --> 18:22.601
I-I... I should get this.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.042
If you're looking
for the bourbon

18:29.066 --> 18:30.335
you left in your desk,
it's gone.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.170
I'm looking for the sample
of yellow pollen.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.257
The stuff I swept off the floor
after throwing it at Noah?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.926
I don't know, I didn't, I didn't
see it while we were packing up.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.303
Well, it was here
a few months back!

18:39.327 --> 18:41.305
Did I miss an experiment
where it grew legs

18:41.329 --> 18:42.764
and a fondness for the outdoors?

18:42.788 --> 18:44.308
Could have been
accidentally thrown away.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.436
Sample was too oxidized to be of
much use, and I've been trying

18:47.460 --> 18:50.147
to get my hands on fresh flowers
but it's impossible.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.589
I think they might be extinct.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.610
Why are you freaking out?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.236
Because I have a math problem.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.363
There's only one flower
in Maria's necklace,

18:58.387 --> 19:00.907
but there are two DeLuca
women and apparently,

19:00.931 --> 19:03.225
the flower is the key
to preventing their illness.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.248
This is everything
from the Caulfield drives

19:08.272 --> 19:10.083
and the experiments done
on Maria's grandmother.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.293
A lot of it was
lost in a lab fire

19:11.317 --> 19:13.211
in the '80s, but...
I'll take a look.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.757
I just want you to see if
anything done could be undone.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.621
I don't want you to, like,
Dr. Frankenstein it.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.303
The experiments were very bad.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.514
My days as an alien scientist
are officially over.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.248
Why don't I believe you?

19:28.417 --> 19:30.228
'Cause it's hard
not to think about

19:30.252 --> 19:32.856
the far-reaching implications
of this kind of research.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.109
You don't get sick
on this planet.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.403
If I could figure out why,
I could eradicate all illness.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.427
But you can't.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.741
Because that would expose us.

19:42.765 --> 19:45.118
Which I would
obviously never do.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.537
It's over.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.029
I got to go.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.294
Hey.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.358
Where are you going?

20:16.382 --> 20:18.402
I-I hate my outfit.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.927
I can't be here.

20:20.928 --> 20:24.574
Yeah, it's very someone else.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.992
Yeah.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.828
Hey, but don't worry.

20:27.852 --> 20:28.912
We can fix it.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.087
Do you need a mirror?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.864
You think I need a mirror?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.094
How's that?

20:44.118 --> 20:46.346
Perfect.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.390
Wait. Here.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.891
Put it on.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.101
Are you sure?

20:51.125 --> 20:53.061
Well, we're friends, aren't we?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.438
Go on.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.106
Okay.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.858
Ah.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.484
You feel more like yourself now?

21:01.552 --> 21:02.904
Does this do anything for you?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.181
That's Nora.
That's Michael's mom.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.419
It's-it's not working.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.296
And I don't feel great
going through this stuff

21:19.320 --> 21:20.922
without Michael knowing.
Why not?

21:20.946 --> 21:22.883
One day, this palace
might all be yours.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.468
It's not working.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.804
I have a business to run,
and you need to go

21:27.828 --> 21:29.014
Instagram something.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.391
Says the social
media revitalizer.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.351
Listen, word to the wise,

21:33.375 --> 21:35.353
every time Max saw Liz
in a skirt and tried

21:35.377 --> 21:37.898
not to pop a bulb, he wound up
setting off a fire alarm.

21:37.922 --> 21:41.109
Every time I push myself
too hard, I miss time,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.361
or wind up accidentally
realizing that my mom

21:43.385 --> 21:45.197
still thinks about
her ex-boyfriend Rocco,

21:45.221 --> 21:47.032
like, in vivid detail.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.408
Okay, where are you
going with this?

21:48.432 --> 21:50.452
Effort doesn't equal control.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.496
So if you want to do this,

21:52.520 --> 21:54.372
you're gonna have to embrace
your inner ice queen

21:54.396 --> 21:56.208
and let it go.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.586
I'm not great
at letting things go.

21:59.610 --> 22:03.715
Yeah. I know, that's hard.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.384
Well...

22:06.408 --> 22:08.595
Maria?

22:08.619 --> 22:11.080
Are you...

22:15.251 --> 22:18.480
Okay, screw it, I'm going in.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.783
Do you like it?

22:29.807 --> 22:32.017
I love it.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.230
Thank you, Walt.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.293
Have you seen Miss Nora?

22:40.317 --> 22:42.820
No, but I'll go look for her.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.199
Miss Nora?

22:49.577 --> 22:51.954
Miss Nora?

22:53.539 --> 22:55.517
Oh, my God.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.103
Did you see that?

22:58.127 --> 22:59.938
Yeah. Are you okay?

22:59.962 --> 23:02.649
Yeah. Who was that?

23:02.673 --> 23:05.485
I think we better get out
of here before Michael finds us.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.136
Come on.

23:19.690 --> 23:20.792
So you said that
you're from Roswell?

23:20.816 --> 23:22.544
Oh, I was from Roswell.

23:22.568 --> 23:26.840
I got out and went to art school
as soon as I graduated.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.217
I work for an artist now.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.844
I help her run her gallery.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.430
Yeah, I used to want
to be a painter,

23:33.454 --> 23:36.391
but then I realized
I loved curating art

23:36.415 --> 23:38.560
way more than
I ever loved making it.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.398
You know, I can look
in someone's eyes

23:43.422 --> 23:45.483
and know if they have
a story worth telling.

23:45.507 --> 23:46.943
That's how I know
you're the real deal.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.779
Oh, no.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.907
Sorry, I'm just, um...

23:52.931 --> 23:55.493
I'm not, like, an artist.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.536
I'm just a...

23:56.560 --> 23:59.146
person with a coping mechanism.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.110
Really?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.030
Prove me wrong.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.521
Are you kidding me?
Where you going, Charlie?

24:23.545 --> 24:25.273
Why are you following me?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.566
Well, I asked myself
what I would do

24:26.590 --> 24:28.568
if my sister was nabbed
by a black ops group.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.320
You're turning yourself in
to Deep Sky, aren't you?

24:30.344 --> 24:31.404
You do know who they are?

24:31.428 --> 24:34.699
I do now, okay?
They made contact.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.077
This postcard was slid
under my motel room door.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.953
They said if I wasn't
at Sutter's Grain Depot

24:38.977 --> 24:41.206
by 11:00, that they would
torture her to death.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.666
Well, that's gotta be a bluff.

24:42.690 --> 24:46.193
No. Okay, I asked for
proof of life; I heard her.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.005
She was out of it,
drugged maybe,

24:49.029 --> 24:50.632
but still giving 'em hell.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.408
What else did you hear?

24:54.243 --> 24:55.345
Look, I care about your sister,

24:55.369 --> 24:56.721
and I'm all the backup
you've got.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.306
There's no way they'd be
holding a prisoner

24:58.330 --> 24:59.474
at their contact point.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.476
Oh, my God.
This isn't your fight, Max.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.977
Go home.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.565
Oh, I swear to God,

25:07.589 --> 25:09.234
if she dies because
I don't show up,

25:09.258 --> 25:10.819
I will kill you myself.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.636
What else did you hear?

25:14.805 --> 25:16.199
A train rolling by.

25:16.223 --> 25:19.977
And... this is insane.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.272
A demonic laugh.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.525
Get in. I know where she is.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.259
Hey.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.009
They said that you mixed whiskey

25:35.033 --> 25:37.595
with your medications;
That's not like you.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.347
What the hell are
you doing here?

25:39.371 --> 25:42.642
I don't know, I mean...

25:42.666 --> 25:43.768
you're my father.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.396
I can't seem to shake you.

25:46.420 --> 25:49.983
Yeah. Yeah, I failed.

25:50.007 --> 25:52.610
Yes.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.612
But in what way, specifically?

25:57.097 --> 26:00.285
Uncle Tripp, I let him down.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.954
I never could figure out
what he needed of me.

26:02.978 --> 26:06.833
And tonight I went
to the bunker.

26:06.857 --> 26:09.419
And...

26:09.443 --> 26:11.629
And I keep trying
to crack the code.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.177
Liz said that you spoke
to Max Evans.

26:17.201 --> 26:20.764
She said that you were
half decent to him.

26:20.788 --> 26:21.848
Is that what this is about?

26:21.872 --> 26:23.683
One of them killed Tripp,
you know.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.684
An alien?

26:24.708 --> 26:28.021
Yeah. Then he hunted them.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.439
He dragged them to
a torture chamber.

26:29.463 --> 26:30.714
I'm not surprised one...

26:33.509 --> 26:35.427
He was the best man I ever knew.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.696
Are you all right?

27:10.212 --> 27:12.482
Are you certain this
is the spot? Yeah.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.108
The train tracks
are right over there.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.819
And that laugh you heard
is a mechanic

27:15.843 --> 27:18.363
that repairs old carny rides
in that warehouse.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.281
They said that she's
in an airtight container,

27:20.305 --> 27:22.349
and that she would die at 11:00.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.644
I'll take the left.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.695
- Charlie!
- Sniper, ten o'clock.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.365
These lights
make us easy targets.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.979
Sniper means we're close.

28:33.003 --> 28:34.856
Okay, help me up.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.149
Okay. Ooh!

28:36.173 --> 28:38.151
Oh, God.
That's-that's pretty bad.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.777
Without the cover of darkness,

28:39.801 --> 28:41.905
we're not outrunning
a sniper's bullet, Charlie.

28:41.929 --> 28:42.906
Let me go get her.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.575
No, Deep Sky wants me alive.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.827
Your brain is worth
considerably less to them,

28:47.851 --> 28:49.954
which means it'll be splattered
all over the dirt.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.229
Give me your hat.

28:56.818 --> 29:01.841
If anything goes wrong,
call Liz. No doctors.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.518
I think I hit him.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.103
He ran off before
the lights went out.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.005
There. She needs
to get to a hospital.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.069
She's still breathing.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.989
I never thought I'd
see her again. Thank you.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.931
Yeah.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.667
Yeah, keep me posted.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.652
I love you, too. Bye.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.923
Oh, good, you're alive.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.219
How long was I gone?

30:28.243 --> 30:30.138
Uh, well...

30:30.162 --> 30:31.472
Taylor Swift is president.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.183
Oh... that's good.

30:34.207 --> 30:37.020
Someone less emotional
in the Oval Office.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.187
Oh...

30:38.211 --> 30:39.939
You found me?

30:39.963 --> 30:42.358
Of course I did. We're partners.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.444
Yeah.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.428
Can you tell me what happened?

30:48.889 --> 30:53.661
The last thing I remember is...
this weird sound.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.539
It made the hairs on my arm
stand up.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.042
And this bright light,

30:59.066 --> 31:01.961
and, um... the pain

31:01.985 --> 31:04.571
in-in the back of my neck
like you wouldn't believe.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.824
You see it?

31:09.493 --> 31:11.453
What is it?

31:12.871 --> 31:13.955
It's a burn.

31:18.085 --> 31:21.022
After that...

31:21.046 --> 31:23.232
there was just darkness.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.235
Um...

31:26.259 --> 31:29.096
I don't remember anything, Max.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.200
I'm gonna need...

31:32.224 --> 31:36.162
I'm gonna need a tox screen
and... and a rape kit.

31:36.186 --> 31:39.499
Hey. Hey, Cam, you're not alone.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.501
You got me and Liz.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.086
And Charlie.

31:43.110 --> 31:43.962
What?

31:43.986 --> 31:45.588
Yeah.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.090
She came as soon as she
found out you were in trouble.

31:47.114 --> 31:52.136
I got to say, that
charm must be genetic.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.160
She's a real peach.

31:55.205 --> 31:57.058
I'll go get her.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.019
Thanks for fighting for me.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.711
I owed you.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.590
I think we can call it even.

32:11.138 --> 32:14.784
Would it kill you to pick up
one of my eight calls?

32:14.808 --> 32:17.561
Sorry. Lost track of time.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.834
Please don't tell me that you
came here to give me a speech

32:22.858 --> 32:24.418
about how you want
to take care of me?

32:24.442 --> 32:26.295
I came here to give you a speech

32:26.319 --> 32:29.072
about how much
of a selfish idiot I am.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.760
I know you can handle yourself.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.578
It's hot as hell, actually.

32:35.829 --> 32:38.182
But the thought of something bad
happening to you,

32:38.206 --> 32:39.809
it makes me feel like someone's
standing on my chest.

32:39.833 --> 32:44.087
Hey. I promise I am not
gonna leave you alone.

32:47.174 --> 32:48.842
You trust me?

32:49.885 --> 32:51.011
Yeah.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.031
Guess that means
I got to let you

32:54.055 --> 32:56.200
explore this weird alien stuff.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.852
Yes, you do.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.837
I was right.
I knew that I was right.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.214
This piece is you outrunning
your demons. This,

33:10.238 --> 33:11.424
this is amazing.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.176
That's what you have to do.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.053
You have to capture them
and then rattle the cage.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.472
This is art.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.624
This is what you're
meant to do, Rosa.

33:23.376 --> 33:26.355
I-It's Rosalinda.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.525
Oh, I love this song. Come on.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.283
Iris, I think
something is wrong.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.118
Come on, dance!

33:42.270 --> 33:43.581
What's happening?

33:43.605 --> 33:45.291
Your star sign's
just out of whack.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.463
Rosa?

33:50.487 --> 33:52.381
Rosa!

33:52.405 --> 33:55.242
Rosa. Hey!

34:01.957 --> 34:03.184
Hey. Hey.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.585
Rosa. Hey. Hey, wake up.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.260
Hey, Charlie...

34:26.606 --> 34:28.960
Kyle said you're gonna be okay.

34:28.984 --> 34:32.570
You just need rest
and plenty of fluids.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.926
We're gonna figure this out.

34:36.949 --> 34:37.949
How?

34:39.286 --> 34:41.973
I don't know how to be okay,
Liz. I'm not like you.

34:41.996 --> 34:45.226
Everybody needs help sometimes.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.353
Help like rehab?

34:47.377 --> 34:48.437
I know you don't...

34:48.460 --> 34:50.170
God, I wish I could go to rehab.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.942
Liz, every day

34:52.966 --> 34:55.735
I think I'm gonna do better.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.489
And every day I mess it up.

34:58.513 --> 35:04.203
I think that I'm gonna be a good
sister or a good daughter.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.747
And I just...

35:06.771 --> 35:10.459
I think about
what I would've done

35:10.483 --> 35:12.878
if I didn't always mess it up.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.965
What art I'd have
made or friends

35:15.989 --> 35:19.242
I would have
and what I'd have seen.

35:23.204 --> 35:28.060
But instead, today I started
a fire while I was unconscious

35:28.084 --> 35:31.254
because I blow up light bulbs
with my brain.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.009
I don't know where
I'm supposed to go for help.

35:37.719 --> 35:42.140
Maria said...
you could borrow this.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.647
It'll suppress your abilities.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.321
So that you don't
burn down rehab.

35:57.364 --> 35:58.300
Maria was here?

35:58.324 --> 35:59.800
Mm-hmm.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.386
She said she loves you.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.288
And that she's gonna need
that back once you're better.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.167
'Cause you will be better.

36:15.383 --> 36:17.568
Hi.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.820
Listen, um,

36:19.844 --> 36:21.822
about today.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.282
You don't have to explain.

36:23.306 --> 36:27.161
Look, I'm a big believer
in enthusiastic consent, so...

36:27.185 --> 36:28.579
If you're not into me, it's...

36:28.603 --> 36:31.248
No, it...

36:31.272 --> 36:33.501
It's not that, trust me.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.503
It's just that I...

36:35.527 --> 36:38.631
I still have my dad's voice
in my head telling me

36:38.655 --> 36:42.593
that being seen with a man
in public is an embarrassment.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.428
To my name and my uniform.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.764
Well, there's nothing
like a dad voice

36:46.788 --> 36:48.974
to mess up
a perfectly good date.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.685
It's also just that...

36:51.709 --> 36:54.105
I mean, Roswell's
so conservative.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.965
This bar is filled with cowboys.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.694
If you want to go
some place private...

37:00.718 --> 37:03.114
Look, I like you.

37:03.138 --> 37:06.266
But I don't want to climb
into somebody else's closet.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.246
I cannot tell you how badly

37:10.270 --> 37:12.206
I want to be done
with this frickin' closet.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.334
But you're not.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.776
And that's okay.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.737
Really.

37:21.406 --> 37:24.051
Listen,

37:24.075 --> 37:28.746
if that voice in your head
ever shuts up, give me a call.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.892
Because between you and me,

37:31.916 --> 37:34.311
making out
with a hot guy in public

37:34.335 --> 37:35.980
is only made hotter
when it pisses off

37:36.004 --> 37:38.131
all the bigots and homophobes.

37:43.386 --> 37:47.575
It says she's gonna disappear
again and not to look for her.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.411
Maybe she didn't write the note.
Maybe Deep Sky grabbed her.

37:50.435 --> 37:54.373
No... No, this letter
is from Charlie.

37:54.397 --> 37:57.734
It's exactly what she would say
in this situation.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.594
Hey. Hey.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.595
How's Rosa?

38:07.619 --> 38:10.014
Not great.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.474
But Kyle called in a favor
at a center.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.434
It's only a few hours away,
so my dad's gonna

38:13.458 --> 38:15.019
take her there tonight.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.437
How's Cameron?

38:16.461 --> 38:18.213
Rattled.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.275
I'm so glad
you found her, but...

38:21.299 --> 38:23.235
I know, I know.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

38:23.259 --> 38:25.196
I was going after Charlie.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.281
I just, I didn't
want you to worry.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.451
I know you think
I'm being overprotective,

38:30.475 --> 38:33.621
but... you could've died.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.438
I wouldn't do that to you again.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.251
Now let's go home.

38:39.275 --> 38:44.840
I got to open up the diner
for my dad in a few hours and...

38:44.864 --> 38:49.953
Honestly, Max, I think I just
need to cry my eyes out alone.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.372
Okay.

38:57.418 --> 39:00.481
I love you.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.858
I love you, too.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.610
Have a good cry, babe.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.580
Trash fire.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.582
Very on-brand.

39:18.606 --> 39:20.584
Okay. Don't be mad at me.

39:20.608 --> 39:23.003
Yes, I did help Maria trigger

39:23.027 --> 39:24.463
some of her abilities,
but in my defense,

39:24.487 --> 39:25.589
she was not about to be...

39:27.740 --> 39:29.426
I know.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.429
We talked. All good.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.223
Good. Okay. Mm-hmm.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.559
Because actually, we were able
to trigger a vision.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.519
I mean, it was a small one.
She's got a lot to learn.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.772
But, Michael, I saw my mom.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.733
I think. I mean,
she was beautiful.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.528
And there was this little boy.
He gave her a windmill.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.072
I mean, the whole thing was
so tender, it was like...

39:50.096 --> 39:51.490
I never thought
that I'd be grateful

39:51.514 --> 39:53.492
to Maria DeLuca for anything,
but as it turns out...

39:53.516 --> 39:54.577
A windmill?

39:54.601 --> 39:56.120
Well, like a, like a small one.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.205
Like, I don't know, it was,
like, a tin can or something.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.940
It was, like,
the cutest thing I've ever...

40:01.858 --> 40:03.961
Michael?

40:03.985 --> 40:06.630
You know, I'm kind of
having a moment here.

40:06.654 --> 40:07.673
Was this what you saw?

40:07.697 --> 40:09.508
Yeah, yes, this.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.281
Michael...

40:37.435 --> 40:39.413
What the hell
are you doing, idiot?

40:39.437 --> 40:40.647
It was you.

40:42.148 --> 40:45.485
You're Walt. You're the little
boy in the photo.

40:48.613 --> 40:49.947
You knew my mother.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.861
Whatever you're planning
on doing,

41:10.885 --> 41:12.470
you don't need to do it,
Charlie.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.658
Your sister's safe
and she needs you right now.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.744
You think Deep Sky needs to have
Jenna by the throat to kill her?

41:18.768 --> 41:22.355
Okay, the only way that I can
protect her is from the inside.

41:34.951 --> 41:38.389
Look, thank you for letting me
see my sister one last time,

41:38.413 --> 41:40.307
but you need to leave now.
