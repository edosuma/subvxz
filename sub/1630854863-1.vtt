04:46.519 --> 04:48.279
Sorry for your loss.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.160
Thank you.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.920
No, I mean that.

04:52.279 --> 04:53.879
I know you do.

04:54.279 --> 04:56.480
Good.

04:59.439 --> 05:01.439
All right lads?

05:07.480 --> 05:11.040
[tense music]

05:17.560 --> 05:18.879
[lawyer] This commission
is investigating

05:18.959 --> 05:21.920
systemic corruption within
the police service.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.480
How would you characterise the
work that you do in Kings
Cross?

05:25.560 --> 05:27.160
I own and run licenced venues.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.519
Night clubs? Do you
standover other venues?

05:30.600 --> 05:33.399
Standover? No.

05:33.480 --> 05:37.319
You can be jailed for lying
to this commission, Mr Ibrahim.

05:37.399 --> 05:40.439
[lawyer] What about corrupt
payments made to the police

05:40.519 --> 05:41.879
for protection of
these venues,

05:41.959 --> 05:44.000
known as "the laugh"?

05:44.079 --> 05:45.759
I don't know
anything about that.

05:45.839 --> 05:47.240
Do you sell drugs
in your clubs?

05:47.319 --> 05:48.399
No.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.439
Mr Ibrahim,

05:49.759 --> 05:52.399
you've been described as
the 'King of the Cross'.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.120
I would suggest that you,

05:54.199 --> 05:56.439
are the new lifeblood of the
Kings Cross drug trade,

05:56.519 --> 06:00.639
and that you control the rivers
of gold that flow from it.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.360
[woman] It's all lies!

06:14.199 --> 06:17.199

06:54.879 --> 06:57.439
[Big Tony] Kings Cross!
The Strip!

06:57.519 --> 06:59.399
The only game in town,

06:59.480 --> 07:01.560
if you want
a naughty night out.

07:01.639 --> 07:07.759
Coke, weed, heroin. A girl,
a boy? Drink after midnight?

07:07.839 --> 07:11.439
A bet on the wheel?
You gotta come to The Cross.

07:11.519 --> 07:17.040
It's the mecca of sin and the
cops just turn a blind eye.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.240
Sex, drugs, rock and roll
and gambling.

07:20.319 --> 07:23.720
Mate! It's an
adult theme park...

07:26.120 --> 07:29.560
...and the money
flows like a river.

07:29.639 --> 07:31.279

07:32.720 --> 07:35.959
All controlled by
a handful of men.

07:36.040 --> 07:40.759
Men like Frank Amante,
Ashtray to his many friends.

07:42.560 --> 07:47.360
He runs the gambling clubs.
Bonafide legend on The Strip.

07:47.439 --> 07:52.480
Peter K! PK.
Runs Pinocchio's restaurant.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.319

07:55.160 --> 07:57.480
[Big Tony] And makes the best
Turkish coffees in town.

07:59.199 --> 08:00.680
Fat George!

08:00.759 --> 08:04.319
Sorry. Can't think of anything
nice to say about that prick.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.959
Runs the strip club with
his fists and his boots.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.920
Pity the poor kids
who work for him.

08:14.439 --> 08:16.720
Sam Ibrahim!

08:17.639 --> 08:21.199
The most feared and fearless
enforcer on The Strip.

08:22.199 --> 08:25.079
Born 2000 years too late.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.240

lions in the Coliseum.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.919
-Open this fucking door.
-Sure.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.320
-You're two months late habib.
-Sam?

08:44.279 --> 08:48.200
[Big Tony] Angelo Lombardi.
Club manager.

08:48.279 --> 08:51.240
New boy! Doesn't understand
the rules yet.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.360
[Nasa] It's very fucking
simple.

08:52.440 --> 08:56.159
I pay the police or
they close you down.

08:56.240 --> 09:01.320
[Big Tony] Nasa Kalouri! Nasa's
what they call the shot caller.

09:01.399 --> 09:03.320
[man] Hey hey! Here they are.

09:03.399 --> 09:06.320
[Big Tony] His job is to
maintain order on the street.

09:06.679 --> 09:09.600
Again? It's three weeks
now you are late.

09:09.679 --> 09:10.960
[Big Tony] Nasa's
the guy who decides

09:11.039 --> 09:14.399
who gets to play here,
and who doesn't.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.960
He's the one collecting
the protection money

09:17.039 --> 09:18.320
and distributing it,

09:19.879 --> 09:22.679
paying off those
who need to be paid,

09:22.759 --> 09:25.759
and kicking it up the food
chain to the bigger fish.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.200
[man] We've got the tallest
titties in town.

09:27.279 --> 09:29.799
We've got the biggest machines
you've ever seen.

09:29.879 --> 09:30.960
Bring your Mrs upstairs.

09:31.039 --> 09:34.120
[Nasa] This is
where Sam comes in.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.440
Him and his crew.
You know them.

09:35.519 --> 09:37.799
They take care
of all of this.

09:37.879 --> 09:39.960
The police that you
just speak with now,

09:40.039 --> 09:41.679
I take care
of this myself.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.120
[Big Tony] There they are.
Kings Cross finest.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.519
Detectives,
Crellan and Mooney.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.200
Two of the best cops
money can buy.

09:49.279 --> 09:52.799
[Mooney] Oh fuck, here comes
Charlene. Fuck me!

09:55.320 --> 10:00.759
[Nasa] For all of this, you
pay. Same as everybody else.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.320
Thursday night,

10:02.399 --> 10:05.360
cash envelope with the name of
your club written on the front.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.639
I spoke to George last night,
Nasa, he knows my situation.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.679
But this! Never again.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.279
[Big Tony] John Ibrahim!

10:17.720 --> 10:19.320
Johnny.

10:20.480 --> 10:24.919
Sam's kid brother.
Keep an eye on that one.

10:26.039 --> 10:27.759
-Hey come on.
-Where my money?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.039
Have I ever been late?

10:35.399 --> 10:37.159
[Big Tony] And the
biggest fish of all.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.679
Ezra Shipman!

10:39.759 --> 10:42.559
The man in control
of that river of gold,

10:42.639 --> 10:44.440
percentage of every dollar
earned on this street

10:44.519 --> 10:46.360
is kicked up to Ezra.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.039
If you had a problem for him,
you have to deal with me,

10:50.120 --> 10:52.639
Big Tony.
The good looking one.

11:14.159 --> 11:15.600
He's crazy,
but he's a good bloke.

11:15.679 --> 11:17.159
I know him, hey.

11:17.559 --> 11:19.000
[young man] You don't have
a spare 150 do you?

11:20.960 --> 11:22.879
I haven't eaten
in a while.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.440
[John IbrahimÃ¶ I'm generous,
but I'm not stupid hey.

are you doing here?

[John Ibrahim]
All right, all right!

11:34.159 --> 11:35.279
[Sam Ibrahim] Go home.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.519
I was going, I'm leaving.
All right!

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
Don't ever come here again.

11:39.679 --> 11:41.679
[John Ibrahim] Fucking relax.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.919
You too. Piss off.

12:05.519 --> 12:07.759
Do it properly or
don't do it at all.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.360
[Sam Ibrahim] Don't look away.
Hey! Johnny!

12:10.200 --> 12:12.759
What the fuck you doing?
It's my mum's tree.

12:13.279 --> 12:14.360
Sorry Sam.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.600
[Big Tony] Sam started
training local kids

12:16.679 --> 12:20.120
with not much going for them,
to stand up and fight.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.000
It took off like a bushfire.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.120
Johnny never needed much
encouragement.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.159
He was born with the fight
hardwired into him.

12:27.240 --> 12:30.360
Hey! Why the fuck
you looking away for?

12:30.440 --> 12:31.679
What have I
fucking told you.

12:31.759 --> 12:33.120
Look at me, don't look
away. You look at me, okay?

12:33.200 --> 12:33.240
All right, all right.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.559
[Sam Ibrahim shouting]
Housam? Housam!

12:38.000 --> 12:39.759

12:39.840 --> 12:43.039
John.
Hey, go help Mum.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.000
Okay,
give me a minute, man.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.320
[both laughing]

12:50.559 --> 12:52.799
It's this question nine.
We're not exactly sure.

12:52.879 --> 12:53.919
[woman] It's pretty
straightforward.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.679
How many children
presently in the home?

12:56.759 --> 12:58.799
My brother's looking
for work at the moment.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.480
So, five then?

13:00.559 --> 13:01.960
He's still there.
It's just a little bit...

13:02.039 --> 13:03.960

13:04.039 --> 13:06.679
Currently any income coming
from her husband overseas?

13:09.799 --> 13:11.360
[woman] When is he
expected to return?

13:18.559 --> 13:20.200
He's waiting on a visa.

13:20.279 --> 13:22.799
No primary source of income?

13:23.080 --> 13:25.519
My brother tries
to bring in what he can.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.440
Utilities are capped at 150.

13:27.519 --> 13:29.039
Take that and your D7
over to the second counter

13:29.120 --> 13:31.840
and wait for them
to call your number.

13:32.879 --> 13:33.919

Thank you mate.

14:33.279 --> 14:36.240
Excuse me, Ashtray. Sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.240
My brother
told me your name.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.399
What do you need kid?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.519
Well, I wanna see if
you've got any work going?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.440
I'm trained.
Same as my brother.

14:43.519 --> 14:45.879
Move along kid.
Try down the road.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.200
Come on. I'll be good.
I promise.

14:47.279 --> 14:48.600
Move along kid.

14:50.039 --> 14:51.759

How old are you?

14:54.519 --> 14:56.080
18, boss.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.840
Well when you turn 17, maybe
come back and try your luck.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.440
Well mostly I just stay
at my uncle's place.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.200
It's okay.
It's actually pretty decent.

16:46.279 --> 16:47.559
I just catch the train.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.320
Honey, you should be in school.

16:50.399 --> 16:51.440
This isn't really a good place

16:51.519 --> 16:53.159
for you to be
hanging around like this.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.840
Yeah, no.
Schools I've been at,

16:54.919 --> 16:55.879
they always just
kick me out anyways.

16:56.559 --> 17:00.679
But it's all right. I like it
up here. I've got friends here.

17:00.759 --> 17:02.159

17:03.240 --> 17:04.319

brother, John.

17:05.279 --> 17:08.119
I've got to know him a
little bit. He's all right.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.319
I like the way you've
done your hair tonight.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.880
-It's pretty.
-See you around, Brett.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.359

[doorman] Jimmy who?

17:50.880 --> 17:52.359
McKinnly... McKenzie?

17:52.440 --> 17:54.960
He got a beef and pickles

17:55.039 --> 17:55.920
Never heard of a Jimmy
fucking McKenzie.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.279
Look, man,

17:58.359 --> 18:01.400

I've got his food. That's it.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.880

What?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.079
Ham and tomato, right?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.720
I didn't order anything.
Piss off.

18:40.799 --> 18:42.440
The roast beef and pickles

[man] Johnny, can you
get us a Turkish coffee

19:06.319 --> 19:07.680
when you get the smokes?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.880
Didn't I tell you to
come back when you're 17?

19:13.960 --> 19:15.599
Your brother know you're
up here, does he?

19:15.680 --> 19:18.079
Yeah.
He knows.

Piss off!

[Kiwi Trevor] Drive!
Fucking drive!

-Hi.

21:44.759 --> 21:48.839
What's going on?
You're okay?

21:48.920 --> 21:50.119
Yeah.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.480
Where are you? You sound
like you're in a tunnel.

21:51.559 --> 21:54.559
I'm at home.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.200
You see outside, the rain?

21:58.599 --> 22:01.240
-Yeah.
-So loud.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.559
It's beautiful.

I just...

22:08.359 --> 22:10.920
How is everything?
How's school?

Did you finish your
art project yet?

[slaps]

22:40.160 --> 22:40.920
What are you doing man?

22:41.240 --> 22:43.759
Is that it? Huh?
Is that what you want?

22:43.839 --> 22:44.839
Piss off Sam.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.039
That cock's a lot
bigger than me.

22:46.119 --> 22:47.039
What do you think he's
gonna do to you? Huh?

22:48.559 --> 22:50.920
-Sam!
-What?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.440
What? You think you're
a fucking big dog? Huh?

22:52.519 --> 22:53.359
Fucking think
about it.

22:53.880 --> 22:57.200
Sam!
What are you doing man?

22:57.279 --> 22:58.359
This shit happens, John.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.279
It's got nothing to do
with you. All right?

23:00.359 --> 23:01.720
You gotta get that through
your thick head.

23:01.799 --> 23:03.160
This guy will break
your fucking neck.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.960
He bashed my fucking friend.
What you think...

23:05.039 --> 23:06.519
I told you to stay away.
That's it, it's done.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.640
I'm gonna get him.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.599
You've got no fucking idea.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.440
If I see you back there,
I'll kill you myself.

[tense dramatic music]

23:32.400 --> 23:35.200
[heart monitor beeps]

23:42.519 --> 23:44.720
It's okay to stay
for a while if you want.

23:54.119 --> 23:58.119
I'm gonna get him for
you, mate. I promise.

24:10.319 --> 24:11.000
Come in.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.119
[music plays in background]

24:26.839 --> 24:29.319
Just give me a few minutes.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.160
All right.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.559

25:42.839 --> 25:46.599
[John yells] Fucking piece
of fucking dirt...

25:46.680 --> 25:48.119
Fuck! Shit!

25:48.200 --> 25:52.559
Guys. Someone needs
to call an ambulance.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.359
Guys! Someone needs to
call an ambulance now.

26:20.799 --> 26:23.079
[car doors slam]

26:30.799 --> 26:32.480
You have another name.

26:32.559 --> 26:34.640
Maybe this is
different story for you.

26:35.799 --> 26:39.279
I will talk with George.
You will be okay.

26:39.359 --> 26:40.240
You talk with your brother.

26:40.319 --> 26:42.640
It's important you
listen to him.

26:44.119 --> 26:45.319
[pager beeps]

26:50.759 --> 26:51.160
Get up.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.000
Let me look at you.

27:05.839 --> 27:07.119
Did he lay a hand on you?

27:14.039 --> 27:15.079
What are you
trying to do, John?

27:15.160 --> 27:17.799
You're trying to
start a fucking war.

27:17.880 --> 27:18.720
You know what I gotta do now?

27:18.799 --> 27:21.240
You know what this means?

27:22.400 --> 27:23.799
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

27:23.880 --> 27:25.759
This isn't fucking
high school anymore.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.960
I'm sorry Sam.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.200
JT will take you.

27:50.519 --> 27:51.799
[Crellan] You?

27:51.880 --> 27:55.920
[Mooney] Kirstie Alley, Cheers.
It was Shelley Long.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.160
[Crellan] Tones.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.880
Boys! What's happening?

27:58.960 --> 28:00.480
[Crellan] Well you know,
a day at the office.

28:01.519 --> 28:03.480
Hey, you hear about
Sam Ibrahim's little brother?

28:03.559 --> 28:04.480
No.

28:05.039 --> 28:07.039
He took Kiwi Trevor's head off
with a fucking baseball bat.

28:07.119 --> 28:07.839
Really?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.680
Put him in intensive care.

28:10.839 --> 28:12.359
It's a pity he didn't
kill the prick.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.759
You want to tell your
tight-arse boss,

28:14.839 --> 28:16.079
it's time for a fucking raise.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.960
Tell him yourselves
you greedy cunts.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.279
[Crellan] Shelley Long?

28:20.359 --> 28:21.880
Yeah, but I'm torn.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.599
Like, Kirstie's
an absolute sort.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.319
[knock on window]

28:26.400 --> 28:28.920
Oh, fuck sake!

28:30.279 --> 28:31.200
[Angelo Lombardi]
Ciao detectives.

28:31.279 --> 28:32.279
What do you want?
We're on break.

28:32.359 --> 28:33.640
I'll make it quick then.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.160
I'm sure you're aware of
how much I owe Nasa Kalouri.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.519
Yeah?

28:37.599 --> 28:39.920
I need you to get me some
more time to pay him back.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.680
What do we look like?
A fucking message service.

28:42.759 --> 28:43.359
What about this?

28:43.440 --> 28:45.400
Subtle mate. Subtle.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.160
Come on please.
He will listen to you.

28:51.319 --> 28:52.279
Thank you. Ciao.

28:52.359 --> 28:53.559
[Mooney] What a fucking
drama queen.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.160
Take it down a few fucking
notches. Jesus Christ!

28:59.240 --> 29:03.119
Seriously. What? Baby
brother, with a baseball bat.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.599
John Ibrahim, used Trevor's
own Louisville Slugger.

29:07.599 --> 29:10.519
-Go the pink one.
-Really! Pink one?

29:10.599 --> 29:11.880
Now his brother
might be a problem.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.000
I've known Sam a long time

29:13.240 --> 29:15.240
and I can guarantee what
he's got in his head is,

29:15.319 --> 29:18.079
he's gonna kill this Trevor as
soon as he gets outta hospital.

29:18.599 --> 29:19.680
Is that a problem then?

29:19.759 --> 29:21.079
Well, if he thinks
his brother's in danger,

29:21.160 --> 29:23.720
he's likely to do that
on Darlinghurst Road

29:23.799 --> 29:25.039
in broad daylight
with a fucking chainsaw,

29:25.119 --> 29:26.240
so it won't be a good look.

29:26.319 --> 29:27.839
I could have a word,
if you want.

29:28.519 --> 29:29.680
The red one, honey.
Trust me.

29:29.759 --> 29:31.599
All right, thanks.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.160
You know what?

29:35.880 --> 29:36.039
Fuck him!

29:38.440 --> 29:39.400
Let's go up The Strip tonight,
get this sorted out.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.160
I think that's
a very good idea.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.519
Sweetheart.
Good to go, darling.

29:46.799 --> 29:47.240
[Sam Ibrahim]
Look at these two.

29:47.680 --> 29:48.720
You eat nothing.

29:48.799 --> 29:51.160
[man] I'll eat
him and his fucking wife.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.079
Then he'll fucking smash ya.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.119
-Oh fuck off.
-He's a weapon.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.400
-Hey boys.
-Hey Tony.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.000
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

30:08.079 --> 30:12.480
Listen, this business
with Kiwi Trevor.

30:13.039 --> 30:14.119
Boss, he doesn't wanna
cause a scene, right?

30:14.200 --> 30:16.839
Now he respects
how you feel, obviously.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.680
But he'd prefer that
you leave it with us.

30:18.759 --> 30:19.440
Let us take
care of it.

30:19.519 --> 30:21.039
Meaning what?

30:22.960 --> 30:24.960
Meaning you can't
fucking knock him.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.039
You're telling me I
can't protect my brother.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.400
That's not what
I'm saying, mate.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.240
I couldn't give a fuck
if you cut the cunts leg off.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.960
It's just personal
with Ezra, all right?

30:35.039 --> 30:36.079
He wants things
off the street and

30:36.160 --> 30:37.480
he wants it discreetly,

30:37.559 --> 30:40.039
and I can promise you John's
not in any danger at all.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.759
[food sizzles]

30:43.839 --> 30:46.240
See, if me and you have a
disagreement about this,

30:46.319 --> 30:47.880
it's not going to
end well for anyone.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.960
Tony, you know that me and
you haven't got any problems.

30:54.039 --> 30:55.799
But we both know as soon
as this guy gets out,

30:55.880 --> 30:57.359
he's going
straight after John.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.440
I can guarantee you
he's not in any danger.

30:59.519 --> 31:01.160
All right!
Have some fucking faith.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.079
If he lays a hand on him,

31:05.160 --> 31:07.759
I will hold someone
accountable for that.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.880
Just careful Tiger.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.400
[man] Come on, let's get
outta here. Let's go. Come on.

31:25.759 --> 31:28.240
[tense music]

31:28.880 --> 31:31.759
[sounds of a struggle]

31:32.720 --> 31:34.000
[Ezra] Dump prick.

31:34.079 --> 31:37.319
[man groans as kicked]

31:40.480 --> 31:43.559
-I could've done that for you.
-I know.

31:55.359 --> 31:56.000
[Big Tony] Fuck!

31:59.920 --> 32:03.759
[water hissing and splashing]

32:05.119 --> 32:08.400
I don't give a fuck
about Angelo's sister.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.920
I'm missing a
fucking football.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.240
I understand him,
we're, you know.

32:12.319 --> 32:14.880
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Just get this one and pay Nasa

32:14.960 --> 32:16.880
what he fucking owes him
so that Nasa can pay me,

32:16.960 --> 32:18.519
you fat fuck.

32:18.599 --> 32:20.519
He will Ezra,
next week, guaranteed.

32:20.599 --> 32:22.240
On my grandkids.

32:22.319 --> 32:25.279
Tony can come and collect
direct from me personally.

32:25.359 --> 32:26.720
What I miss? All right?

32:26.799 --> 32:28.799
Perfect timing.
The Fat Fuck George here

32:28.880 --> 32:30.759
was just here to explain to me
that his brother-in-law

32:30.839 --> 32:32.839
is going through some
personal problems,

32:32.920 --> 32:36.079
which is why he can't fucking
pay me what he fucking owes me.

32:38.279 --> 32:39.240
Give me the meatballs.

32:39.319 --> 32:40.839
That's an excellent choice.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.720
Want I send Sam?

32:43.240 --> 32:46.119
No. I don't want
you to send Sam.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.559
Does Nasa here have to send
Sam, Fat Fuck George?

32:51.839 --> 32:54.160
That Sam not necessary.
We can handle it.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.640
Well then fuck off.

33:05.559 --> 33:07.000
Have you smelt that?

33:08.839 --> 33:11.400
That's a prawn cocktail.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.680
It's fresh.

33:12.759 --> 33:16.039
No. No, I don't like prawns.

33:17.480 --> 33:21.759
[heart monitor beeps]

33:29.839 --> 33:32.759
[tense music]

33:43.640 --> 33:45.240
[Kiwi Trevor grunts in pain]

33:45.319 --> 33:46.839
Remember me.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.359
I swear to God, if you step
foot back in this country
again,

33:50.440 --> 33:52.759
I'll break your neck for
these bare fucking hands.

34:00.759 --> 34:03.240
[train rattles]

34:05.640 --> 34:07.920
[woman] There you go.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.800
You right?

34:12.639 --> 34:15.280
-You right, are you?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.000
Hey.

34:21.599 --> 34:23.639
You're safe, okay.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.599
[John Ibrahim] Hey Brett.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.280
[Brett] Wow!

34:31.360 --> 34:32.800
Been hanging onto it
for you, mate.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.519
Geez. Thanks Johnny.

34:34.599 --> 34:36.119
Of course.
Take care, you.

34:54.599 --> 34:57.599
[woman] Hey, let's go.

35:05.039 --> 35:08.320
-[woman] You got a smoke love?
-[man] No, sorry.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.039
[Nasa] You think you
can stop your brother

35:10.119 --> 35:13.400
from coming around
here forever? Simple.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.119
Put him on collections. Have
been driving out west all week.

35:16.199 --> 35:21.119
Problem solved.
Sam, start with Bruce,

35:21.199 --> 35:23.119
then through Double Bay
back to my place. Okay?

35:23.199 --> 35:24.800
Hey.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.559
What are you doing here?
Looking for another slap?

35:39.280 --> 35:41.800
Hey, lower your head,
so I see your face.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.159
He's just a kid.

35:44.679 --> 35:46.159
I'm 16.

35:46.239 --> 35:47.599
You know how
to drive car?

35:47.679 --> 35:49.239
Yeah, of course.

35:49.519 --> 35:51.239
There you go.

35:51.320 --> 35:53.639
I have no problem if he's
in Tarago with Anton and JT.

35:53.719 --> 35:56.599
Yeah, I got a problem. He can't
say over the fucking dashboard.

35:56.679 --> 35:58.960
You can go start in
Parramatta like everyone else.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.960
Yeah, uh look, I make
pretty good money

36:07.039 --> 36:09.119
helping Ashtray
with food orders.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.760
Don't be a smartarse,
show some respect.

36:10.840 --> 36:14.599
I'm not, I'm being honest.
I'm just telling you the truth.

36:14.679 --> 36:17.559
Well I think you make much more
money working for your brother.

36:17.639 --> 36:19.920
Come to cafe tomorrow,
we talk about this.

36:20.639 --> 36:21.679
So, sounds good.
I appreciate it.

36:21.760 --> 36:25.079
Four o'clock. Pinocchio's.

36:28.159 --> 36:29.559
We'll talk later.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.400
And now you can keep
eye on him.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.960
[car engine starts]

36:34.039 --> 36:37.400
Okay. Start with Bruce,
then we go through Double Bay.

36:38.079 --> 36:39.039
[woman] Hey Johnny.

36:44.599 --> 36:46.320

36:50.679 --> 36:51.800

37:00.239 --> 37:02.760
I'll pay youse

37:02.840 --> 37:04.559
[men grunt and struggle]

37:04.639 --> 37:05.840
Hey!

37:06.559 --> 37:10.840
Guys! Hey! Settle down.
Hey. Stop. Stop!

37:10.920 --> 37:12.920
Move. Move. Come on. Settle

37:13.920 --> 37:15.360
[John moans]

37:15.440 --> 37:16.719
[Angelo Lombardi] Oh shit!

37:21.599 --> 37:25.719
[dramatic music]

37:54.159 --> 37:55.199
[Doctor] Can we get
that line set up please.

37:55.280 --> 37:56.519
[Nurse] Yes.

37:56.599 --> 37:57.440
[Doctor] We're losing him.

37:58.239 --> 37:59.880
[Nurse] 35... 21...

37:59.960 --> 38:02.239
[Doctor] You take over, please.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.960
[heart monitor beeps quickly]

38:07.159 --> 38:09.360
[Doctor] Can everyone step
away from the table.

38:12.599 --> 38:14.559
[defibrillator charges]

38:14.880 --> 38:16.920
Clear!

38:18.719 --> 38:19.440
[Doctor] Come On. Come on.

38:19.519 --> 38:22.119
Clear! Clear!

38:23.639 --> 38:25.480
Clear!

38:30.480 --> 38:32.719
[heart monitor slows down]

38:35.320 --> 38:37.840
[Nurse 1] Hard to believe how
much damage a stab wound can
do.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.519
[Nurse 2] Yeah.
Just another stab victim.

38:54.840 --> 38:57.159
[footsteps]
[dramatic music]

39:00.719 --> 39:02.360
Shit! Fuck!

Um, Jack look, I just...

39:02.960 --> 39:04.079
[loud whack]

39:04.159 --> 39:07.400
Angelo Lombardi!
Where the fuck is he?

39:07.480 --> 39:08.840
JT. We don't fucking know.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.920
If you see him,
you tell him.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.719
He finds us
before we find him.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.960
We're with you guys,
mate. Come on.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.199
-JT! Angelo is not here.
-Fuck!

[glass shatters]
[crowd exclaim]

39:48.840 --> 39:50.519
Everyone's on it, mate.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.239
Ant's sitting off his place.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.320
We're gonna get this bastard.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.400
I want him face to face.
Him and me.

40:03.559 --> 40:06.599
[door opens]

40:31.280 --> 40:33.280
[woman sobs]

40:37.760 --> 40:39.559
[Fat George] They're following
my sister. Ezra this...

40:39.639 --> 40:42.000
[Ezra] That was out!

40:42.079 --> 40:44.079
-[woman] That was an accident.
-[Ezra] That was embarrassing.

40:44.159 --> 40:45.840
There was no way you were
getting that back baby.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.519
[Fat George] And fucking Stella
and Angelo, they live
separated.

40:48.599 --> 40:50.360
It's like they're divorced.

40:50.440 --> 40:51.199
How does this solve anything?

40:51.280 --> 40:53.159
Well maybe your brother-in-law

40:53.239 --> 40:55.000
stuck his knife in
a wrong fucking teenager.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.599
You think Sam's
outta line do you?

40:58.679 --> 41:02.519
Oh! That boy. This is
just an accident. No?

41:02.599 --> 41:04.840
[tennis player groans]
[woman] Yes!

41:04.920 --> 41:07.239
-Where is he now?
-Who?

41:07.320 --> 41:08.960
Who do you fucking think?

41:09.039 --> 41:11.480
Oh, Ezra, please.
We can't find him now.

41:11.559 --> 41:13.440
We call his number
all night, this morning.

41:13.519 --> 41:16.159
Well, he, he's not gonna be
in his fucking home, is he?

41:16.239 --> 41:19.239
No. No. Of course.
It's just...

41:21.079 --> 41:24.559
I'm worried about Sam,
if his brother dies.

41:25.199 --> 41:27.840
Well maybe you can
have a talk to him.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.519
You know, I have
been extremely patient.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.840
Fuck off.

41:43.599 --> 41:45.239
[loud dramatic music]

41:45.320 --> 41:46.800
Angelo?

41:48.159 --> 41:49.440
Angelo?

41:54.320 --> 41:55.639
What a fucking pig.

42:07.599 --> 42:09.159
Oh hello!

42:16.320 --> 42:19.800
[Ezra on phone] And doing his
own coke on the side.

42:19.880 --> 42:22.199
The fucking prick
was double dealing us.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.159
There's only one way
this ends Anthony.

42:29.159 --> 42:31.239
[plane tires screech]
