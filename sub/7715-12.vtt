00:02.535 --> 00:04.202
Okay, let's go.
I'm freezing.

00:04.270 --> 00:05.804
People, wait, wait, wait.
Come back, come back.

00:05.871 --> 00:07.672
One fun one.
We're gonna do a fun one.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.474
<i>One Charlie's angels.
One. Let's go.</i>

00:10.542 --> 00:12.679
Okay, this is just
a Christmas card

00:12.766 --> 00:13.815
from your paper supplier.

00:13.882 --> 00:15.019
No one's putting this
on their fridge.

00:15.087 --> 00:17.222
Ooh, I got it, you guys,
how 'bout this...

00:17.290 --> 00:19.726
Michael, what if all the boys
are on one side,

00:19.792 --> 00:20.793
all the girls are on the other.

00:20.860 --> 00:23.129
The boys are, like,
"why, I oughta,"

00:23.197 --> 00:25.497
and the girls are, like,
"let's go shopping"?

00:25.565 --> 00:27.501
Let's just jump in the air.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.006
That's it!
That's a picture! Yes!

00:29.073 --> 00:30.575
Jump in the air.
We're gonna jump in the air.

00:30.643 --> 00:32.177
- Here we go.
- Okay, one...

00:32.244 --> 00:36.508
Two...Three...
Not everyone jumped.

00:36.576 --> 00:38.971
Okay, everybody jump
in the air this time, please.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.506
Here we go.

00:40.573 --> 00:43.174
One, two, three.

00:43.242 --> 00:44.442
Still some people not jumping.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.077
You gotta be kidding me.
Who isn't jumping?

00:46.145 --> 00:48.814
I'll tell you who.
Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley,

00:48.882 --> 00:50.783
- Angela, and Oscar.
- I am jumping.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.618
You are?
Let me see you jump.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.620
Oh, my God.

00:54.687 --> 00:56.019
This is a store-bought camera.

00:56.087 --> 00:57.919
This isn't one of those special
military-grade cameras

00:57.987 --> 00:59.287
that would be able
to capture that.

00:59.354 --> 01:00.454
I'm freezing.

01:00.522 --> 01:02.589
Um, also, Erin is jumping
way too early.

01:02.657 --> 01:03.757
She's on the ground
by "three."

01:03.824 --> 01:05.024
I didn't want to miss it.

01:05.092 --> 01:06.925
Well, if we all jump
really high,

01:06.993 --> 01:08.593
we'll be in the air longer.
Do that.

01:08.661 --> 01:10.295
Here's a question
nobody's asking...

01:10.362 --> 01:11.996
- Is this worth it?
- Don't answer that.

01:12.063 --> 01:13.196
People, listen up
and listen good.

01:13.264 --> 01:15.364
We need to just get one picture

01:15.432 --> 01:17.365
where we're all in the air
at the same time. Yes?

01:17.433 --> 01:18.866
- Why?
- I believe in us.

01:18.933 --> 01:20.667
- We can do this.
- Okay, on three,

01:20.734 --> 01:22.001
everyone in the air.

01:22.069 --> 01:26.305
Three, two, one, zero.

I'm the office
administrator now,

which means I'm basically
being paid

02:00.836 --> 02:02.836
to be head
of the party planning committee.

02:02.904 --> 02:05.938
The first thing I did as head...
I shut it down.

02:06.006 --> 02:09.475
At its worst it was
a toxic political club

02:09.543 --> 02:13.745
used to make others
feel miserable and left out.

02:13.813 --> 02:16.948
At its best it planned parties.

02:17.015 --> 02:20.017
It hardly looks fake.
It's so lush.

02:20.085 --> 02:23.153

- Nope.
- No? Good.

Did anyone get drunk already?

02:47.243 --> 02:48.176
Not yet.

02:48.244 --> 02:49.611
Good for you.

02:49.679 --> 02:52.514
Angela, lay it on me...
What's the problem?

02:52.581 --> 02:54.483
Nothing.
Should be fun.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.551
So, Stanley, how big is the bug

02:56.619 --> 02:58.020

Pam got those
sugar-free cookies I like.

02:59.822 --> 03:00.888
I'm doing fine.

03:00.956 --> 03:04.790
All right, well,
I will be in my office

03:11.361 --> 03:13.161
It's all good, Santa.

03:13.228 --> 03:14.495
Well, that's a relief.

03:45.055 --> 03:47.190

03:47.258 --> 03:49.726
We just want to say
how grateful we are.

03:49.793 --> 03:51.594
Sabre is actively looking
for ways to involve me

03:51.662 --> 03:53.627
as minority executive trainee.

03:53.695 --> 03:55.729
So I suggested choosing
the annual Christmas gift

03:55.797 --> 03:56.997
to the employees.

03:57.064 --> 03:59.065
And they said,
"oh, yes. Perfect.

Thank you, Kelly. Finally,
something for you to do."

04:02.302 --> 04:05.070

Yeah, I don't even have
a laptop.

would be under

if I were white.

- Come on.

I said "I wonder."
I didn't say "I think."

on fleece blankets.

Why do you ask me so often
if we're still dating?

I'll take one of those
pink pouches.

- A party.

to make an announcement.

- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

I just wanted
to let you know that

07:39.283 --> 07:40.450
I'll be taking
a leave of absence

07:40.517 --> 07:41.551
starting next week.

07:41.618 --> 07:43.218
Because you've been on the lam?

07:43.286 --> 07:44.552
Because the "boring police"
have been after you,

07:44.620 --> 07:45.686
and they finally
caught up with you?

07:45.754 --> 07:47.053
No, the opposite.

07:47.121 --> 07:49.322
I was actually selected
to be a juror

07:49.390 --> 07:51.124

red-headed sad sack.

it was Toby.

Death to Toby!

your announcements.

in your sentences.

- What do you expect me to do?
- What's the case, Toby?

08:11.375 --> 08:12.575
Well, I really can't
talk about it,

08:12.643 --> 08:13.808
but it's a very
high-profile case.

08:13.876 --> 08:15.209
- Is it criminal?
- Yes.

- Have we heard of it?
- I don't know.

teacher who tried

student into a sex slave?

- Come on.
- Was it the post office guy

all over the mail?

about the transition,

- Guys, who's Holly?

That is a great question, Erin.

18:02.689 --> 18:04.556
Oh, it's fabulous.

18:04.624 --> 18:05.758
I love what you did!

18:05.825 --> 18:07.326
Isn't it wonderful?

18:07.393 --> 18:09.928
We love it here.
Don't you love it?

18:09.995 --> 18:12.130
All right, let me show you
to your desk.

18:12.198 --> 18:14.833
[Stereotyped Mexican accent]
I show you to your dayyy-esk!

18:14.900 --> 18:15.833
[Stereotyped Mexican accent]
Watch out for my guns.

18:15.901 --> 18:16.834
They're both loaded.

18:16.901 --> 18:18.569
What kind of guns do you have?

18:18.636 --> 18:20.470
- Six-shooter?
- Aww...

18:20.537 --> 18:23.905
This is weird.
I can't believe you're here.

18:23.973 --> 18:25.106
This feels like you never left.

18:25.174 --> 18:27.074
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah, kind of. Yeah.

18:27.142 --> 18:28.776
[Chuckles]

18:28.843 --> 18:31.744
- Oh, God.
- Oh, and you have a Woody.

18:31.812 --> 18:34.245
Bah!

18:34.313 --> 18:36.681
- Oh...I love...
- Aj gave me that.

18:36.749 --> 18:41.585
Well, that's understandable.
Still raw.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.586
- Woody your favorite character?
- Mm-hmm.

18:43.654 --> 18:45.187
<i>You know who my favorite
character in toy story is?</i>

18:45.255 --> 18:47.456
- Andy's mom.
- Why?

18:47.524 --> 18:48.824
Because without Andy's mom,
there's no plot.

18:48.892 --> 18:50.993
And without any plot,
there is no movie.

18:51.061 --> 18:53.595
That is a really good point.

18:53.663 --> 18:56.665
<i>Aj said he hadn't seen any
of the toy story movies.</i>

18:56.732 --> 18:57.799
- You're kidding me.
- No. I know.

18:57.867 --> 19:00.634
I'm going, "what?
Are you serious?"

19:00.702 --> 19:02.435
- What a douche bag!
- Get a life!

19:02.503 --> 19:04.805
Get a... Yeah.
Good riddance.

19:04.872 --> 19:07.641
We sat down and we watched
them all in one day.

19:07.708 --> 19:09.809
<i>Now he's the biggest
toy story fanatic ever.</i>

19:09.876 --> 19:11.844
- Good for him.
- Next day I found him

19:11.911 --> 19:12.845
in my bed.

19:12.912 --> 19:15.313
Really?
That's creepy.

19:15.381 --> 19:16.814
How did Aj get in your house?

19:16.882 --> 19:19.817
We live together.

19:19.885 --> 19:21.552
Oh, you do?

19:21.620 --> 19:22.786
He had a little note
pinned to him

19:22.854 --> 19:27.023
that said,
"you've got a friend in me."

19:29.860 --> 19:32.827
- Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
- Yeah.

19:32.895 --> 19:34.896
- I love him.
- Me too.

19:37.994 --> 19:39.461
♪ Christmas tree,
Christmas tree ♪

19:39.529 --> 19:42.965
♪ won't you be
my Christmas tree? ♪

19:43.032 --> 19:44.499
Hey, how about this one?

19:44.567 --> 19:46.667
Ehh, seems a little
full of itself, right?

19:46.734 --> 19:47.968
Kind of a pretty boy.

19:48.035 --> 19:49.803
What if we got
a really beat up one,

19:49.871 --> 19:50.971
like on Charlie brown.

19:51.038 --> 19:52.772
And we just loved it
for what it is?

19:52.840 --> 19:54.340
Maybe. I mean...

19:54.408 --> 19:57.043
No, she be talking
to your mom or something.

19:57.110 --> 19:58.711
This is my daughter too,
Justine!

19:58.778 --> 20:00.812
You seem to think...

20:00.880 --> 20:04.348
Oh...

20:04.416 --> 20:06.451
Pick a damn tree already.

20:06.518 --> 20:09.787
Um, hey, Darryl, listen,
it's none of my business,

20:09.855 --> 20:11.588
but if I couldn't have
Cece for Christmas,

20:11.656 --> 20:14.425
I'd be really upset too.

20:14.492 --> 20:16.260
I don't have kids or anything,

20:16.327 --> 20:18.928
but if my grandmother
ever dies,

20:18.996 --> 20:20.362
I'm going to kill myself.

20:20.429 --> 20:23.363
Jada don't want to
spend Christmas with me.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.001
She told her mom
it wasn't as much fun.

20:26.069 --> 20:27.970
How could she say that?

20:28.038 --> 20:29.637
You know, I took her
to the toy store

20:29.705 --> 20:30.871
to buy her own presents.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.639
Well, Darryl, no kid wants

20:32.707 --> 20:34.608
to buy their own
Christmas presents.

20:34.676 --> 20:36.342
Her mom wants me
to take her to mass.

20:36.410 --> 20:37.377
I guess that's something to do.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.778
No, you should have her mom do

20:38.846 --> 20:41.013
the boring Christmas stuff
on her time.

20:41.081 --> 20:43.182
You should be associated
with the fun parts of Christmas.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.816
How do I do that?

20:44.884 --> 20:46.485
Bring her to the party.

20:46.552 --> 20:49.387
Yeah, we'll have Santa,
and we'll play games with her.

20:49.455 --> 20:50.489
It'll be a lot of fun.

20:50.556 --> 20:51.791
Yes!

20:51.858 --> 20:55.527
You'll be Mr. Christmas
by the end of the night.

20:55.595 --> 20:57.995
Hey, guys, the tree's here.

20:58.063 --> 20:59.263
- Hey.
- Nobody hug me...

20:59.331 --> 21:00.832
I'm covered in tree sap, so...

21:00.899 --> 21:02.833
Why would someone hug you?

21:02.901 --> 21:05.534
Hey there, Jada.
Nice to see you again.

21:05.602 --> 21:07.936
I'm Santa Claus.
Welcome.

21:08.004 --> 21:09.171
Are you serious?

21:09.238 --> 21:11.406
It's a sophisticated take.

21:11.474 --> 21:13.774
He doesn't look
like Santa Claus.

21:13.842 --> 21:16.343
No, he doesn't.

21:16.410 --> 21:18.178
I told her Santa would be here.

21:18.246 --> 21:20.214
Yeah, well, I was told
that Holly would be here,

21:20.281 --> 21:21.548
single and ready to date.

21:21.616 --> 21:23.850
- And we all got misled.
- Who told you that?

21:23.918 --> 21:27.854
Nora Ephron, in every
romantic comedy ever made.

21:27.922 --> 21:29.956
So is it an open relationship?

21:30.024 --> 21:31.858
Oh, God, no.

21:31.925 --> 21:34.193
Well, you're almost 40.
Oh, do you not want kids?

21:34.261 --> 21:37.395
Oh, I want kids.
I really want kids.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.564
But Aj and I are
practically engaged.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.866
We talk about
spending our lives together.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.234
- So where's the ring?
- Kelly!

21:44.302 --> 21:46.237
Um, how are you adjusting
to the move?

21:46.305 --> 21:47.706
Nobody cares about that.

21:47.773 --> 21:48.940
Look, you have to
make him commit,

21:49.008 --> 21:50.375
or kick his butt to the curb.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.609
You guys, I don't think
any of us

21:52.677 --> 21:55.344
are really qualified to be
giving Holly personal advice

21:55.412 --> 21:57.446
about her love life.

21:57.514 --> 21:59.381
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's
not in any position

21:59.448 --> 22:02.484
to be shooing guys away.

22:02.551 --> 22:05.253
I don't get it.
I'm sorry.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.254
I just...
I don't get it.

22:07.322 --> 22:11.693
Okay, listen,
I'm gonna tell him

22:11.760 --> 22:13.794
that if he doesn't propose
by the end of this year,

22:13.862 --> 22:15.395
we're over.

22:15.463 --> 22:19.532
- Wow, an ultimatum.
- Yeah.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.700
It doesn't really seem
like you.

22:20.768 --> 22:23.469
That is a great idea.
Ultimatums are key.

22:23.537 --> 22:25.538
Basically, nobody does anything
for me anymore

22:25.606 --> 22:27.273
unless I threaten
to kill myself.

22:38.484 --> 22:39.952
[Maniacal laughter]

22:40.019 --> 22:42.488
Don't. Stop... Dwight!

22:42.556 --> 22:45.025
- Dwight, stop!
- Oh, no. Oh, no!

22:45.092 --> 22:46.993
- Stop!
- Oh, no.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.996
- Yes, taste my wrath!
- Okay. Okay...

22:50.064 --> 22:51.431
- You like that?
- Seriously!

22:51.498 --> 22:53.832
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

22:53.900 --> 22:55.800
[Maniacal laughter]

22:55.868 --> 23:00.636
Yes, I have a wig for every
single person in the office.

23:00.704 --> 23:02.004
You never know when
you're gonna need

23:02.071 --> 23:04.806
to bear a passing resemblance
to someone.

23:04.873 --> 23:08.175
I just want it to stop.

23:08.243 --> 23:10.210
So cool, right?

23:10.278 --> 23:11.211
There's no connection between

23:11.279 --> 23:13.446
- the origin story and the quest.
- Okay.

23:13.514 --> 23:15.181
We need to know
who Jimmy Halpert was

23:15.249 --> 23:16.482
before he was bitten
by the bear.

23:16.550 --> 23:18.551
Otherwise
it's the bear's quest.

23:18.618 --> 23:21.320
Okay, well, I just
sorta meant, like, cute, right?

23:21.389 --> 23:22.722
Well, did you come here
for help,

23:22.790 --> 23:24.290
or did you come here for me
to tell you how great it is?

23:24.359 --> 23:26.193
I mean, help,
if it's something simple,

23:26.261 --> 23:28.329
like add page numbers
or laminate it or...

23:28.396 --> 23:31.064
It sounds like
you know what you want.

23:31.132 --> 23:33.333
<i>It's also a little derivative
of a serial called bear man.</i>

23:33.400 --> 23:34.400
Did you look that up?

23:34.468 --> 23:35.634
- No.
- Okay.

23:35.702 --> 23:38.837
- Oh, Jim. Hey.
- Hey, Toby.

23:38.904 --> 23:41.872
There's this female stenographer
at the courthouse...

23:41.940 --> 23:44.308
- No way.
- Who looks exactly like you.

23:44.375 --> 23:46.376
- That's incredible.
- Yeah. No, it's uncanny.

23:46.444 --> 23:47.677
You know what's crazy?
I can't reconnect with you

23:47.745 --> 23:51.846
right now.
Hold on one second.

23:51.914 --> 23:53.848
Oh!
[Startled gasps]

23:53.916 --> 23:55.917
Excuse me.

23:55.984 --> 23:58.419
[Clears throat]

23:58.487 --> 24:04.491
[Wind whistling through window]

24:10.830 --> 24:12.530
I guess there are just
some people

24:12.598 --> 24:15.901
who you stay together with
when you transfer,

24:15.968 --> 24:17.302
and some people you don't.

24:17.369 --> 24:18.903
And that's just the way it is.

24:21.439 --> 24:24.408
And I can be mature about that.

24:32.751 --> 24:36.686
It's so cold.
Even with my coat on.

24:36.753 --> 24:39.287
Maybe your senator boyfriend
has a blanket in his car

24:39.355 --> 24:41.155
for screwing Americans.

24:41.223 --> 24:42.457
Yet another opportunity

24:42.524 --> 24:44.625
where a blanket would have
come in handy.

24:44.693 --> 24:46.293
You guys, this has to stop.

24:46.361 --> 24:48.028
Someone could have
really gotten hurt.

24:48.096 --> 24:50.163
What if Meredith was taking
her smoking break

24:50.231 --> 24:51.297
below that window?

24:51.365 --> 24:52.831
You know what would
have happened?

24:52.899 --> 24:54.966
The shards of glass would have
shaved her face right off.

24:55.033 --> 24:57.268
And, yes,
it might have been funny,

24:57.335 --> 24:59.636
but it also would have been
incredibly tragic.

24:59.704 --> 25:00.837
I could not agree more.

25:00.905 --> 25:02.038
And I just want to state
for the record

25:02.106 --> 25:03.606
that I am intending to sue Jim

25:03.674 --> 25:05.374
for acute psychological
distress.

25:05.442 --> 25:06.909
What are you talking about?

25:06.977 --> 25:08.444
You're the one terrorizing me.

25:08.511 --> 25:11.546
With snowballs, Jim?
With Fluffy little snowballs?

25:11.614 --> 25:13.414
No. I thought
we were just playing.

25:13.482 --> 25:14.616
Dwight's right.

25:14.684 --> 25:16.618
What you did was dangerous
and inappropriate.

25:16.686 --> 25:17.886
Mmm, mmm. Mm-hmm.

25:17.954 --> 25:19.454
I'm really surprised
at you guys.

25:19.522 --> 25:24.125
Last time I was here,
you were both best friends.

25:24.193 --> 25:28.896
All this arguing reminds me
of a very funny story.

25:28.964 --> 25:32.434
You see this on my desk?

25:32.502 --> 25:34.502
Know who gave me this?

25:34.570 --> 25:36.803
My girlfriend Tara,
who lives in New York city.

25:36.871 --> 25:39.738
- Wait, what girlfriend?
- I haven't told you about her.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.172
I find that unlikely.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.907
You email me
when you get a new zit.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.176
I'm a man in my mid-40s
and I still get zits.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.610
I think that's
pretty interesting.

25:46.678 --> 25:48.278
But you know what,
I am not on trial here.

25:48.346 --> 25:49.446
The Scranton strangler is.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.414
So anyway,
we have this great weekend,

25:51.482 --> 25:53.183
and she drives me
to the airport,

25:53.250 --> 25:54.584
and we get to JFK,

25:54.651 --> 25:56.985
but I'm flying out
of Laguardia.

25:57.053 --> 25:58.687
So we laugh and laugh
and laugh,

25:58.754 --> 25:59.821
and then we spend
the rest of the day

25:59.889 --> 26:02.657
walking around slomo
drinking latte.

26:02.725 --> 26:05.093
And at the end of the day,
she gives me this,

26:05.161 --> 26:07.228
and she says, "Michael,
maybe next time,

26:07.296 --> 26:10.131
you should take a cab."

26:10.199 --> 26:11.532
I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.501
I do. She is.

26:13.569 --> 26:16.868
Did you see her face?

26:16.935 --> 26:19.301
Well, it seems to me
that there is a person

26:19.369 --> 26:20.469
sitting out there in the annex

26:20.536 --> 26:23.338
that still has feelings
for Michael g. Scott.

26:23.406 --> 26:27.175
And it ain't Tara.

26:27.242 --> 26:28.876
So you went homemade this year.

26:28.944 --> 26:31.012
- Yep.
- Yeah.

26:31.079 --> 26:33.180
Money problems... Is that
what this is about?

26:33.247 --> 26:35.816
I mean, oh, dear, I don't think
we can help you out.

26:35.883 --> 26:38.785
No, no.
Jim had a great year, actually.

26:38.853 --> 26:40.787
I just wanted
to get your opinion.

26:40.855 --> 26:42.755
Are you good at homemade?

26:42.823 --> 26:44.023
Look at this.

26:44.091 --> 26:47.794
Yeah.

26:47.862 --> 26:51.461
[Bass playing]

26:51.529 --> 26:54.931
Who did this?

26:54.998 --> 26:56.331
It's obvious to me
I'm not welcome here,

26:56.398 --> 26:57.431
but somebody better tell me
who did this,

26:57.499 --> 26:58.765
or else I'm leaving.

26:58.833 --> 27:01.434
Well, I don't think Erin
seems to like you.

38:21.328 --> 38:24.030
Aj won't commit to Holly.

38:24.098 --> 38:26.966
And she's gonna tell him that
if he doesn't propose to her

38:27.034 --> 38:28.801
by the end of the year,
it's over.

38:28.869 --> 38:30.803
Really?

38:30.871 --> 38:33.539
Really.

38:33.607 --> 38:35.208
And I don't know about you,

38:35.275 --> 38:37.343
but I don't know of
a lot of happy marriages

38:37.411 --> 38:39.545
that start off
with an ultimatum...Do you?

38:39.613 --> 38:43.049
No.

38:43.116 --> 38:46.651
So just be patient.

38:46.719 --> 38:48.720
Yeah.

38:48.788 --> 38:50.455
I mean, I can wait till then.

38:54.961 --> 38:56.261
Come here.

38:56.329 --> 38:57.529
I don't want you to fall.

38:57.597 --> 39:01.668
I surrender.

39:01.736 --> 39:04.371
I do not accept your surrender.

39:04.438 --> 39:06.539
There's only one way
that I would ever relent.

39:06.607 --> 39:08.508
Anything.
You got it.

39:08.576 --> 39:11.945
You hit Pam in the face
with a snowball

39:12.012 --> 39:13.246
while I watch.

39:13.314 --> 39:15.348
You're a psychopath.

39:15.416 --> 39:17.684
I'll take that as a no.

39:17.751 --> 39:20.086
I was in the mall,
and I saw that,

39:20.154 --> 39:22.054
and I thought it had your name
written all over it.

39:22.122 --> 39:26.358
Michael, this is the gift
that corporate gave us

39:26.426 --> 39:27.359
that I picked out.

39:27.427 --> 39:28.394
You're re-gifting this
to me.

39:28.462 --> 39:31.129
No, that's not...

39:31.197 --> 39:32.930
No, I went to the mall
and I picked that out

39:32.998 --> 39:34.765
especially for you.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.400
Oh, yeah?
Well, show me the receipt.

39:36.467 --> 39:40.438
From the mall.

39:40.505 --> 39:42.808
That...

39:42.875 --> 39:45.110
This is a fast food receipt
from April.

39:45.178 --> 39:46.412
Well...That...

39:46.479 --> 39:48.313
God, how many number nines
did you order?

39:48.381 --> 39:51.816
Is everyone here kind of mean?

39:51.883 --> 39:55.152
Oh, I think everyone's on edge
because of the strangler trial.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.020
- Oh.
- Hey...

39:57.088 --> 39:58.321
I'm so glad you came down.

39:58.389 --> 40:02.058
It's been so much harder
than I expected.

40:02.126 --> 40:03.526
Hey, what happened to Woody?

40:03.594 --> 40:05.527
Oh, okay, get ready for this.

40:05.595 --> 40:06.861
You're not gonna believe it.

40:06.929 --> 40:10.498
I was making salad, and he fell
right into the dressing.

40:10.566 --> 40:13.300
I mean, there was salad dressing
all over him.

40:13.368 --> 40:16.536
- He smells awful.
- It was blue cheese dressing.

40:16.604 --> 40:18.338
Great.

40:20.441 --> 40:22.141
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey.

40:22.209 --> 40:23.142
We wanted
to give you something.

40:23.210 --> 40:25.344
- Oh.
- Merry Christmas.

40:25.412 --> 40:28.413
Thank you.
A hostess apple pie!

40:28.481 --> 40:30.715
This is my favorite breakfast.
How did you know that?

40:30.782 --> 40:32.083
Thank you very much.

40:32.150 --> 40:34.318
- What do you say?
- You're welcome.

40:34.386 --> 40:37.686
Oh, you know,
I seem to remember

40:37.754 --> 40:39.421
that Santa promised
that he would listen

40:39.489 --> 40:40.889
to all the gifts
you wanted for Christmas.

40:40.957 --> 40:43.458
Didn't he say that?

40:43.526 --> 40:45.693
I think I know where he is.

40:45.761 --> 40:47.661
- A trampoline...
- Mm-hmm.

40:47.729 --> 40:49.697
- Video games.
- Video games.

40:49.764 --> 40:52.833
[Continues indistinctly]

40:52.901 --> 40:55.267
- A horse.
- A horse.

40:55.334 --> 40:57.669
Are you sure
you don't want a pony?

40:57.736 --> 40:59.203
- You want a real horse.
- Mm-hmm.

40:59.271 --> 41:00.771
All right.

41:00.839 --> 41:02.274
You have to pick up after them.

41:03.986 --> 41:05.153
Hey, sorry.
I'm ready.

41:05.221 --> 41:07.055
I don't want to go.

41:07.123 --> 41:10.924
Oh...
Come on, bear man.

41:10.992 --> 41:12.692
Come on.

41:17.063 --> 41:19.530
Have you ever seen 'em do that?

41:27.306 --> 41:31.042
[Wind whistling]

41:32.378 --> 41:34.145
[Whispering] I'm sorry.

41:34.212 --> 41:35.613
I had no idea.

41:35.680 --> 41:38.315
No, it's... it's okay.

41:38.383 --> 41:40.917
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

41:40.985 --> 41:42.652
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.

41:52.063 --> 41:53.763
- Okay, this is it.
- What?

41:53.831 --> 41:55.332
- Go! Go! Go!
- What? What is it? What?

41:55.399 --> 41:56.666
Oh, my God!

41:56.734 --> 42:00.137

Jim!

42:10.581 --> 42:14.684
[Jim grunting]

42:14.752 --> 42:16.819
In the end,
the greatest snowball

42:16.887 --> 42:18.488
isn't a snowball at all.

42:18.555 --> 42:19.288
It's fear.
