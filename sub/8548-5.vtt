I'M STUDYING.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.631
EDWARD, YOUR STUDY HABITS
ARE PITIFUL.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.533
HOW ARE YOU DOING
IN SCHOOL ANYWAY?

00:32.600 --> 00:36.470
OH, NO SWEAT, DAD. I'M SURE
I'M GETTING STRAIGHT C'S.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.741

02:18.306 --> 02:21.008
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T
COLORED IN YEARS.

02:21.074 --> 02:24.345
I FORGOT HOW GOOD I WAS.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.647
NOTICE MY USE OF
CONTRAST AND SHADOWING

02:26.714 --> 02:29.483
TO CREATE
THE ILLUSION OF DEPTH.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.752
TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T
STAY IN THE LINES.

02:39.126 --> 02:42.162
WE HAVE GOT TO
DO SOMETHING WITH EDDIE.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.565
I'M OPEN.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.435
HARRIETTE,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.537
HIS STUDY HABITS
ARE TERRIBLE.

02:49.603 --> 02:53.374
CARL, IT'S HIS FIRST SEMESTER
IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE'S ADJUSTING.

02:53.441 --> 02:57.378
TOOK HIM A MONTH TO
SETTLE ON A THREE-RING BINDER.

02:57.445 --> 03:01.282
YES, AND THEN HE WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT TWO-HOLE PAPER.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.517
HARRIETTE, HE'S
IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.320
WITHOUT GOOD GRADES, HE'LL
NEVER GET INTO COLLEGE.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.423
WITHOUT COLLEGE, HE'LL
NEVER GET A GOOD JOB.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.526
AND WITHOUT A JOB,
HE'LL LIVE HERE FOREVER.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.263
THAT'S IT. WE'RE
HIRING A TUTOR.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.167
I'M FINISHED STUDYING
FOR TONIGHT.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.835
HEY, GRAB A CRAYON.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.704
YOU CAN COLOR
WITH US.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.707
NO, THANKS. I DON'T WANT
TO OVERLOAD MY BRAIN.

03:28.108 --> 03:30.711
TYING YOUR SHOES
OVERLOADS YOUR BRAIN.

03:32.145 --> 03:36.317
OH, YEAH? I CAN TIE MY SHOES
WITH BOTH HANDS BEHIND MY BACK.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.920
I REST MY CASE.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.835
ALRIGHT, EVERYONE,
IT'S THAT TIME AGAIN.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.719
CARL, WILL YOU
JUST OPEN THEM?

04:11.785 --> 04:16.290
THIS RITUAL IS
AS MUCH FUN AS A ROOT CANAL.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.826
HARRIETTE, THIS IS
A WINSLOW FAMILY TRADITION.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.262
NOW, $5.00 AN "A" IS
AN EXCELLENT INCENTIVE.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.864
WHAT'S AN INCENTIVE?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.981
A B-PLUS?
LET ME SEE THAT.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.386
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.820
I ALWAYS GET
STRAIGHT As.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.022
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN
A "B" IN MY LIFE.

05:22.089 --> 05:25.292
COOL DOWN, LAURA,
IT'S AN EXCELLENT REPORT CARD.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.795
HERE'S $25.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.564
I'LL TAKE IT,
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.539
AND NOW YOU, EDWARD.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.609
DAD, LISTEN, BEFORE
YOU OPEN MY REPORT CARD,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.611
THERE SOMETHING
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.846
MY SCIENCE TEACHER
HATES ME.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.515
OH, AND DURING
MY MATH EXAM,

05:47.581 --> 05:49.950
I GOT EXTREMELY DIZZY.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.086
I THINK I HAVE
AN OUTER EAR INFECTION.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.061
CARL, IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.831
WHAT?

06:06.834 --> 06:09.369
I DIDN'T GET THE "B"
IN WOOD SHOP?

06:12.606 --> 06:14.007
COME OVER HERE, SON.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.984
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.553
DO WHAT?

06:27.521 --> 06:29.657
EDDIE GOT
STRAIGHT As.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.897
OUR EDDIE? THIS EDDIE?

06:38.165 --> 06:39.667
EDDIE WINSLOW?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.837
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.542
THIS IS A DREAM
COME TRUE.

06:50.277 --> 06:54.181
WELL, SIX As,
5 BUCKS APIECE,

06:54.247 --> 06:56.550
YOU OWE ME
40 BUCKS, DAD.

07:03.557 --> 07:08.462
5 TIMES 6 IS 30. HE
CAN'T EVEN MULTIPLY.

07:08.529 --> 07:12.800
I GOT AN "A" IN MATH
THAT SAYS I CAN.

07:12.866 --> 07:16.604
UH, SON, I SEEM TO BE
A LITTLE SHORT.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.740
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO PAY
OUT THIS MUCH CASH.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.576
PERHAPS I CAN GET SOME
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

07:22.643 --> 07:26.680
FROM THE LOVELY
REPORT CARD LADY.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.483
IF YOU CALL ME REPORT
CARD LADY ONCE MORE,

07:29.550 --> 07:31.451
YOU'LL SPEND THE NIGHT
IN DETENTION.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.589
PERHAPS
YOU'LL TAKE A CHECK.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.537
HI, MOM.

IF YOU WATCH TV.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.847
WALL STREET
WEEKEND REVIEW IS ON.

07:59.913 --> 08:06.019
NO, I DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE FUN
UNTIL I GET AN A IN HISTORY.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.389
GOOD TO SEE CARL'S INCENTIVE

08:15.929 --> 08:18.431
HI, RODNEY.
HELLO. MRS. CRAWFORD.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.067
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.268
AAH!

08:24.572 --> 08:26.607
RODNEY, I HATE IT
WHEN YOU DO THAT.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.310
COME ON.
IT'S A JOKE.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.545
RODNEY,
DON'T BE PUTTING

08:31.612 --> 08:33.581
ANY OF THAT FAKE VOMIT
IN MY KITCHEN.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.220
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EDDIE,
HE'S IN HIS ROOM.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.956
THANKS.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.093
AND DON'T BE PUTTING
ANY SARAN WRAP ON
THE TOILET SEATS.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.533
OHH.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.636
HEY, RODNEY.
OHH.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.037
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:57.104 --> 08:59.039
I DON'T KNOW.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.674
I FEEL KIND OF SICK.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.025
THAT WAS GREAT.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.960
COME ON. LET'S GO
TO THE MOVIES.

09:20.027 --> 09:24.231
I NEED TO STUDY. I REALLY
WANT TO KEEP UP MY GRADES.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.768
YEAH, RIGHT. I GUESS
YOU GOT YOUR REPORT CARD.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.771
FUNNY, HUH?
YEAH.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.574
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.311
YOU GOT STRAIGHT As,
RIGHT?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.512
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.950
WE ALL DID.
REALLY?

09:43.016 --> 09:46.687
YEAH. I MADE FAKE REPORT CARDS
ON MY COMPUTER.

09:46.754 --> 09:47.988
I MAILED THEM OUT.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.223
THE REAL ONES DON'T COME
TILL TOMORROW.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.733
YOU MEAN, THESE AREN'T
MY REAL GRADES?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.702
NOT UNLESS YOU HAD
A BRAIN TRANSPLANT.

10:04.838 --> 10:08.308
MAN, I THOUGHT
I WAS SMART.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.177
YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE SMART?

10:10.243 --> 10:11.745
WHAT ARE YOU, STUPID?

10:13.847 --> 10:15.816
DAD'S GOING TO KILL ME.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.031
HI, MOM.
HI, AUNT RACHEL.

10:31.098 --> 10:31.999
HI, HONEY.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.134
I'M MAKING COOKIES.
WANT SOME?

10:35.736 --> 10:37.404
NO, THANKS.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.206
COOKIES WILL
MAKE ME HAPPY.

10:40.841 --> 10:44.111
I DON'T DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.881
GOT ANY LIVER?

10:47.948 --> 10:51.584
LAURA, I KNOW
YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT
YOUR REPORT CARD,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.987
BUT YOU DID WELL.
YOU ALWAYS DO.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.023
MOM, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.191
I WANTED TO GO TO
A TOP LAW SCHOOL--

10:58.258 --> 11:00.493
HARVARD, YALE,
OR MICHIGAN.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.363
I DON'T WANT TO END UP AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF BUBBA.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.934
YOU TALK TO HER.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.802
SHE WON'T
LISTEN TO ME.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.237
YOU KNOW, LAURA,

11:10.303 --> 11:13.306
I GOT IN TO COLLEGE
WITHOUT STRAIGHT As.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.908
REALLY?
YES.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.310
I WAS
A WELL-ROUNDED STUDENT.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.779
I WAS NEWSPAPER EDITOR,

11:18.846 --> 11:21.681
I WAS IN THE DRAMA CLUB,
AND MARCHING BAND.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.785
YOU'RE MUSICAL.
HOW ABOUT MARCHING BAND?

11:24.852 --> 11:26.954
AUNT RACHEL,
I PLAY THE PIANO.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.090
YEAH, IT WOULD BE HARD

11:30.157 --> 11:34.795
PUSHING THAT ACROSS
THE FOOTBALL FIELD.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.264
THAT B-PLUS WILL BE
HANGING OVER MY HEAD

11:37.330 --> 11:39.199
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.770
OH, DARN!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

11:42.836 --> 11:45.405
LOOK AT THESE COOKIES.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.874
I'LL HAVE
TO THROW THEM OUT.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.541
THEY LOOK
FINE TO ME.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.943
NOT ME.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.379
THAT ONE DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH CHIPS.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.247
WHO CARES.
IT WILL STILL TASTE GOOD.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.417
NO. IF THEY ALL AREN'T PERFECT,
THEY HAVE TO GO.

11:57.484 --> 12:02.122
BUT YOU DON'T
THROW COOKIES OUT
JUST BECAUSE ONE--

12:02.189 --> 12:04.324
OHH...

12:05.725 --> 12:07.094
I GET IT.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.595
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
PARENT TRICKS

12:08.661 --> 12:13.600
WHERE YOU TRY
TO TELL ME SOMETHING
WITHOUT TELLING ME.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.235
DID IT WORK?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.805
I DON'T KNOW LET ME EAT
A FEW COOKIES,

12:17.871 --> 12:19.406
AND I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.448
HI, HONEY.
HI, HONEY.

12:28.515 --> 12:32.352
THAT DRY CLEANER DID
A GREAT JOB ON YOUR UNIFORM.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.421
THEY EVEN REMOVED
THE JELLY STAIN.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.289
OHH, THAT'S GREAT.
GREAT.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.625
BUT LOOK AT THESE
COLLEGE BROCHURES

12:38.691 --> 12:39.860
I GOT FOR EDDIE.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.463
WITH HIS GRADES,
HE CAN GO TO ANY SCHOOL.

12:43.530 --> 12:48.401
HARVARD...YALE...COLUMBIA.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.738
YOU'RE GETTING CARRIED AWAY
WITH THIS GRADE THING.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.406
LAURA THOUGHT
HER LIFE WAS OVER

12:53.473 --> 12:54.908
BECAUSE OF ONE B-PLUS.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.610
HARRIETTE, SHE JUST
KNOWS THE COMPETITION.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.980
NOWADAYS, THERE'S
NO ROOM FOR AVERAGE.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.482
YOU'RE EITHER A SHARK
OR YOU'RE FISH BAIT.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.786
HI, MOM. HI, DAD.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.088
HI, BABY.
THERE YOU ARE, SON.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.823
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.726
LOOK WHAT
I GOT FOR YOU.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.829
TA-DA!

13:15.896 --> 13:19.566
OH, DAD, IT'S JUST
WHAT I'VE BEEN WANTING.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.201
ALL FOR YOU, SMART GUY.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.604
CAREFUL WITH
THAT JACKET.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.506
DRY CLEANING
COSTS A FORTUNE.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.011
DAD, WE NEED TO TALK.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.679
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT, SON.

13:32.745 --> 13:35.115
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
COLLEGE BROCHURES

13:35.182 --> 13:37.017
FROM TOP IVY LEAGUE
COLLEGES.

13:37.084 --> 13:41.254
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO COLUMBIA?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.623
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO GO TO COLUMBIA?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.392
I DON'T EVEN
SPEAK SPANISH.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.167
THAT'S FUNNY.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.735
KEEP YOUR SENSE
OF HUMOR.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.104
NO MATTER HOW SMART
YOU GET,

13:57.170 --> 14:00.007
PEOPLE LOVE
GOOD HUMOR.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.708
THAT'S GOOD,
BUT LISTEN--

14:01.774 --> 14:03.276
ONE THING
BEFORE I FORGET.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.679
I RAN INTO A FRIEND
WHO WENT TO HARVARD,

14:06.746 --> 14:09.082
AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT
YOUR GOOD GRADES.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.152
HE'S ARRANGED A MEETING
WITH A HARVARD RECRUITER.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.923
IF YOU'D RATHER
GO TO YALE, IT'S ALRIGHT.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.424
NO PRESSURE.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.467
OH, HI, AUNT RACHEL.
HI, BABY.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.737
IF YOU'RE WORKING ON YOUR NOVEL,
I WON'T BOTHER YOU.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.139
THAT'S OKAY.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.007
I'M 800 PAGES
FROM THE END.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.909
A FEW MINUTES
WITH YOU WON'T HURT.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.544
COME ON.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.217
SO...

14:45.018 --> 14:46.486
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

14:50.790 --> 14:53.493
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.627
WELL, YEAH.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.267
DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

15:02.402 --> 15:03.570
YEAH.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.174
TODAY?

15:09.642 --> 15:13.380
THERE WAS THIS LITTLE MISTAKE
ON MY REPORT CARD.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.949
A MISTAKE?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.417
YEAH. RODNEY
FIGURED OUT A WAY

15:17.484 --> 15:20.220
TO MAKE PHONY REPORT
CARDS ON HIS COMPUTER,

15:20.287 --> 15:22.555
AND HE GAVE US
GUYS STRAIGHT As.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.327
OOH.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.332
WHAT GRADES
DID YOU REALLY GET?

15:32.399 --> 15:35.068
MOSTLY Cs
AND A COUPLE OF Bs.

15:35.135 --> 15:38.005
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY GOOD TO ME.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.974
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR DAD.

15:41.041 --> 15:46.779
OH...WELL, WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

15:46.846 --> 15:48.881
WELL, I TRIED
TO TELL DAD YESTERDAY,

15:48.948 --> 15:51.251
BUT EVERY TIME I DID,
HE GAVE ME A PRESENT.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.889
SO HERE'S
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.693
I'LL STUDY HARD
AND ON MY NEXT REPORT CARD,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.829
I'LL GET STRAIGHT As,

16:02.895 --> 16:05.632
AND THAT WAY
NO ONE WILL GET HURT.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.605
WELL, THAT IS A PLAN.

16:14.141 --> 16:19.112
OR I COULD
JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.881
I LIKE THAT PLAN.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.152
I HAD A FEELING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

16:25.218 --> 16:29.022
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR
IF YOU TELL THE TRUTH.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.124
IT WILL BE MUCH WORSE

16:31.191 --> 16:34.827
IF DAD FINDS OUT
FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.030
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
A LOT BRIGHTER

16:37.097 --> 16:39.299
THAN PEOPLE
GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.245
OOH, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH MY LITTLE RICHIE?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.214
HE JUST STARTED CRYING.

16:54.281 --> 16:58.218
WELL, HE'S EITHER WET,
HUNGRY, CRANKY, OR TIRED.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.019
SO CHANGE HIM,
FEED HIM, TICKLE HIM,

17:00.087 --> 17:01.554
AND PUT HIM TO BED.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.128
COME ON, MY LITTLE MAN.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.864
HI, HONEY.
HI, BABY.

17:11.931 --> 17:12.999
WHERE'S EDDIE?

17:13.066 --> 17:14.567
OUT ON THE PORCH.
HEY, EDDIE!

17:14.634 --> 17:17.470
COME IN THE KITCHEN
FOR A SECOND.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.338
WHAT'S THAT?

17:18.405 --> 17:19.939
IT'S A PERSONAL
COMPUTER SYSTEM.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.374
I BOUGHT IT FOR HIM.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.578
YEAH, DAD.

17:25.645 --> 17:29.249
LOOK WHAT I GOT YOU.
YOUR OWN COMPUTER SYSTEM.

17:29.316 --> 17:33.820
COMES WITH ALL THIS SOFTWARE,
A COLOR MONITOR AND MOTOR.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.258
DAD...I'VE GOT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,

17:38.325 --> 17:40.893
AND I DON'T QUITE KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.962
TRY ME, BUT GO SLOW.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.731
I'M NOT
AS SMART AS YOU ARE.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.869
MY REPORT CARD
WAS A FAKE.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.271
FOR A SECOND
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

17:51.338 --> 17:56.008
YOUR REPORT CARD WAS A FAKE.
WHAT DID YOU REALLY SAY?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.044
I SAID IT WAS FAKED.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.412
DON'T KEEP SAYING THAT.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.283
RODNEY DID IT
ON HIS COMPUTER.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.120
HE GAVE ALL OF HIS
FRIENDS STRAIGHT As.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.790
IT'S A FAKE?

18:10.857 --> 18:14.527
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN, BUT YOU
NEVER GAVE ME THE CHANCE.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.464
DAD, I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.200
HERE'S MY REAL
REPORT CARD.

18:27.807 --> 18:31.110
EDDIE, THIS IS YOUR
BEST REPORT CARD YET.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.312
CARL, LOOK.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.281
FOUR Cs AND TWO Bs

18:35.648 --> 18:37.717
AND NO As.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.121
YEAH.
I GUESS I'M STUPID.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.264
MAYBE I'M THE ONE
THAT'S STUPID.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.807
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

19:01.474 --> 19:02.575
YEAH?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.911
UH, IT'S ME, SON.
CAN I COME IN?

19:06.446 --> 19:07.680
SURE.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.154
EDWARD, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

19:15.222 --> 19:16.423
YEAH.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.094
SON, I...

19:22.161 --> 19:24.964
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY I'M SORRY.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.966
I LET YOU DOWN, DAD.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.469
EDWARD, YOU
DIDN'T LET ME DOWN.

19:29.536 --> 19:33.706
IT'S JUST THAT I OVERREACTED
TO THE REPORT CARD.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.909
YOU MADE ME PROUD
BY TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.579
I KNOW
THAT WASN'T EASY.

19:39.646 --> 19:43.850
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
I FELT LIKE I WAS SMART,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.952
AND IT REALLY FELT GOOD.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.620
YOU AND MOM
WERE PROUD OF ME,

19:47.687 --> 19:52.058
AND I WAS LOOKING
FORWARD TO GOING
BACK TO SCHOOL MONDAY.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.961
BUT NOW IT'S BACK
TO BEING STUPID EDDIE.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.933
SON, LOOK AT ME.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.371
YOU ARE NOT STUPID.

20:04.437 --> 20:08.007
YOU MAY BE A LITTLE
UNDISCIPLINED AT TIMES.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.075
WELL, NO,
LET'S FACE IT.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.643
YOU'RE VERY
UNDISCIPLINED.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.347
BUT, SON,
YOU'RE NOT STUPID.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.549
YOU'VE JUST
CONVINCED YOURSELF

20:16.616 --> 20:18.418
THAT YOU'RE
NOT SMART.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.587
I GET HELP FROM LAURA.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.656
WELL, NOW, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.924
EDWARD, YOU
JUST BROUGHT HOME

20:24.991 --> 20:26.759
YOUR BEST
REPORT CARD.

20:26.826 --> 20:30.930
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU CAN DO EVEN BETTER.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.201
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

20:35.268 --> 20:36.569
SON...

20:38.004 --> 20:42.174
I BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN
DO ANYTHING YOU WANT...

20:42.241 --> 20:43.843
IF YOU WORK AT IT.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.178
I WOULDN'T
BE PUSHING YOU SO HARD

20:46.245 --> 20:47.747
IF I DIDN'T THINK SO.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.250
YOU KNOW, SON,

20:51.318 --> 20:54.954
YOUR GRANDFATHER AND I
NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.256
WE WANTED TO.

20:57.324 --> 21:01.227
BUT IT JUST DIDN'T
WORK OUT THAT WAY.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.063
I GUESS THE REASON WHY
I GOT SO CARRIED AWAY

21:04.130 --> 21:07.199
WAS BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO BE THE FIRST WINSLOW

21:07.266 --> 21:11.170
EVER TO COME HOME
WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.773
WELL, I WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE, TOO.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.209
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION,

21:17.276 --> 21:20.347
AND I HEAR COLLEGE
BABES ARE REALLY FINE.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.584
WELL, YOU KEEP TRYING,

21:24.651 --> 21:26.786
AND YOU'LL FIND
THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.691
I'M...PROUD OF YOU, SON.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.927
YOU DID GOOD.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.231
THANKS, DAD.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.634
IT'S, "YOU DID WELL".

21:41.701 --> 21:45.071
I LEARNED THAT
IN ENGLISH CLASS.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.773
I STAND CORRECTED.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.808
DAD, YOU
WEREN'T REALLY SERIOUS

21:48.875 --> 21:50.943
ABOUT SENDING ME
TO COLUMBIA, WERE YOU?

21:51.010 --> 21:53.880
YOU KNOW THERE'S A DRUG
WAR GOING ON THERE?

21:57.684 --> 21:59.051
SON...

22:08.127 --> 22:09.829
SO, HOW'S EDDIE?

22:09.896 --> 22:11.531
EDDIE IS FINE,

22:11.598 --> 22:15.402
AND I'VE DECIDED NOT
TO PUT EMPHASIS ON GRADES.

22:15.468 --> 22:19.406
DOES THIS MEAN
NO REPORT CARD LADY?

22:19.472 --> 22:21.207
ABSOLUTELY.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.275
PUTS TOO MUCH PRESSURE
ON THE KIDS.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.812
BESIDES, IT WAS
COSTING ME A FORTUNE.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.916
FROM NOW ON,
I'M GOING TO LET THE KIDS

22:29.982 --> 22:31.350
GO AT
THEIR OWN PACE.

22:31.418 --> 22:35.287
NO MORE PUSHING.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.223
THERE'S A MR. STEVENS
AT THE DOOR.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.426
HE SAYS HE'S
A RECRUITER FROM HARVARD.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.360
OH, NO. I FORGOT!

22:41.428 --> 22:43.396
I GOT TO TELL HIM HE'S
WAY TOO EARLY FOR EDDIE.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.598
LET ME TELL HIM.
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

22:45.665 --> 22:49.836
ABOUT RICHIE?
HE'S ONLY 9 MONTHS OLD.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.771
I WANT TO TALK
TO HIM ABOUT ME.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.606
HE'S CUTE.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.877
SO, HARVARD, HUH?
