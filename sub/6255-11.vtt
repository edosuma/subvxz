(thunder crashes)

00:03.177 --> 00:04.912
Your finger is
blocking the lens.

00:04.945 --> 00:07.082
I know how to take
a picture, Bonnie.

00:07.115 --> 00:09.524
Yeah, of your finger.

00:09.557 --> 00:11.019
We found a dead
body, Norman.

00:11.060 --> 00:12.987
We have to document it
for the authorities.

00:13.028 --> 00:14.997
Unless you don't feel
like a real American.

00:15.030 --> 00:17.062
(scoffs) We've gone from bad
photographer

00:17.095 --> 00:18.397
to terrorist now,
Bonnie?

00:18.430 --> 00:19.702
If the shoe fits...

00:19.735 --> 00:20.936
(shutter clicks)

00:20.969 --> 00:22.878
Okay, now let's get
a few selfies

00:22.911 --> 00:25.214
so the kids
will believe us.

00:27.518 --> 00:28.716
Okay.

00:28.749 --> 00:31.456
We have to cover
the body.

00:33.735 --> 00:36.170
<i>Forensic Files</i> says
an undisturbed crime scene

00:36.203 --> 00:39.007
is crucial to
solving the crime.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.240
Right.

00:41.273 --> 00:43.109

00:58.193 --> 01:00.790
You know what?
You shouldn't be here, not now.

01:00.823 --> 01:02.497
This woman stole
my identity, Seeley.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.266
She was my friend. She ruined
my good name, she betrayed me.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.969
I don't know when
I'll be able

01:07.001 --> 01:08.400
to get credit again.
Okay.

01:08.433 --> 01:09.632
And you wouldn't
even have arrested her

01:09.673 --> 01:11.104
if it wasn't for
what Angela did.

01:11.137 --> 01:13.438
Okay, I got it, okay?
But listen to me.

01:13.471 --> 01:14.902
I take her into
Interrogation alone.

01:14.943 --> 01:17.177
I know. I just want
to look her in the eye,

01:17.210 --> 01:18.177
make sure it's real.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.849
Right. From afar.
Okay.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.118
I'm sorry, Cam.

01:28.151 --> 01:30.788
I didn't think.
I'm really...

01:30.821 --> 01:33.620
Oh! Okay, back up!
Get her in the room, okay?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.460
I'm good. I'm good.
Thank you for that.

01:35.493 --> 01:36.958
Didn't I tell you
"from afar"?

01:36.998 --> 01:38.327
(phone rings)
Just wait. Booth.

01:38.368 --> 01:40.966
Yeah. Okay, where?

01:40.999 --> 01:42.700
Lake Anna.
Great, got it.

01:42.733 --> 01:44.164
Okay, we have a body. Let's go.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.268
What about her?

01:45.301 --> 01:46.332
You really think I care

01:46.372 --> 01:47.738
if she sits in there
for a while?

01:47.771 --> 01:49.834
I don't. Do you?
Let's go. Come on.

01:49.875 --> 01:51.673
(siren wails briefly)

01:53.107 --> 01:54.910
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:58.419 --> 02:01.889
Oh! I'm stepping over her leg,
and what is that smell? Ooh!

02:01.922 --> 02:03.226
Charred tissue

02:03.259 --> 02:04.530
and bone.

02:04.563 --> 02:06.595
It's uniquely amaroidal.

02:06.628 --> 02:08.699
It's actually quite noxious.

02:08.732 --> 02:11.203
Wow. It's nasty if you ask me.
And it looks

02:11.236 --> 02:13.035
like he exploded
all over the place.

02:13.068 --> 02:15.172
Well, pelvic inlet shows
that the victim is a female.

02:15.205 --> 02:18.076
And essentially,
she did explode.

02:18.109 --> 02:20.878
This will be the first
recorded case

02:20.919 --> 02:22.381
of remains being
struck by lightning.

02:22.414 --> 02:24.684
I find myself quite
giddy at the prospect

02:24.716 --> 02:28.723
of discovering how
it destroyed the remains.

02:28.756 --> 02:31.387
Really? Giddy? Great, okay.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.428
It is more acrid
than one would normally find

02:33.461 --> 02:34.556
from a burnt corpse.

02:34.597 --> 02:35.796
'Cause of these babies:

02:35.829 --> 02:38.459
stinkbugs native
to wild rye grass.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.563
Smells like cilantro.
Smell that.

02:40.596 --> 02:42.404
Holding my, okay, bug boy?

02:42.437 --> 02:43.772
Do you have anything
useful here?

02:43.805 --> 02:45.436
Excuse me for enjoying my work.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.037
Based on blowfly larvae,

02:47.078 --> 02:49.247
the body's been here
for about three days.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.743
"Three days." Why can't you
just lead with that?

02:50.776 --> 02:52.216
You know what?
I'm gonna go

02:52.249 --> 02:53.721
talk to the uniform cops
over here.

02:53.754 --> 02:56.491
Did you see the person
who stole your identity?

02:56.524 --> 02:57.722
Yes.

02:57.755 --> 02:59.457
And I struck her.

02:59.490 --> 03:01.457
Awesome.
Oh, you have no idea.

03:01.490 --> 03:04.498
Judging from the size
and development of this torso,

03:04.531 --> 03:07.564
the victim was pre-pubescent,
maybe ten years old.

03:07.605 --> 03:10.269
I disagree.
Note the slight eruption

03:10.302 --> 03:11.807
of the victim's third molars.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.881
The roots are still in
the process of completion.

03:13.914 --> 03:16.250
Also, there's very
little attrition.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.020
So you're saying
she was a teenager?

03:18.053 --> 03:20.157
I'd posit 16 or 17 years of age.

03:20.190 --> 03:21.463
BOOTH:
Definitely a body dump.

03:21.496 --> 03:23.529
There's tire tracks
and drag marks.

03:23.562 --> 03:25.569
Why was development so stunted?

03:25.603 --> 03:28.338
And why does she have evidence
of so many fractures?

03:28.371 --> 03:30.805
I'm sorry. Wouldn't that happen
when she exploded?

03:30.846 --> 03:32.679
That wouldn't account for this.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.482
Give me your pen, Booth.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.450
Oh, here.

03:37.523 --> 03:39.058
Whoa!
How'd that happen?

03:39.091 --> 03:43.531
The victim has
a surgical plate in her scapula.

03:43.564 --> 03:44.900
The lightning magnetized it.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.332
How cool is that?

03:46.365 --> 03:47.500
(Brennan laughs)

03:47.533 --> 03:48.700
No, that's okay.

03:48.733 --> 03:49.972
You keep the pen.

03:50.005 --> 03:51.301
It's got person on it now.

03:51.341 --> 03:53.036
I'm sorry.
I'll wipe it off.

03:53.069 --> 03:55.642
No, it's okay.
I'll just go get another pen.

VAZIRI: What are the chances of
lightning hitting a corpse?

04:35.581 --> 04:37.780
Don't ask that question
in front of Dr. Brennan.

04:37.814 --> 04:40.580
She'll force you
to find the answer.

04:40.621 --> 04:43.789
Look what was snagged
on the C-4.

04:43.822 --> 04:45.790
Ooh...

04:45.823 --> 04:47.325
a locket.

04:47.358 --> 04:48.292
May I?

04:48.326 --> 04:50.357
Yeah.

04:58.505 --> 05:00.376
Here we go.

05:00.409 --> 05:02.009
Mom and dad?

05:02.042 --> 05:03.747
With the skull
in such bad shape,

05:03.780 --> 05:05.500
Angela may be able to use
the parents to get

05:05.516 --> 05:07.146
an approximation
of what our victim looked like.

05:07.187 --> 05:09.355
I'm seeing
remodeling here.

05:09.388 --> 05:13.428
And an avulsion fracture
of the olecranon process of the ulna.

05:13.461 --> 05:17.631
That suggests repeatedly contractions
of the triceps tendon.

05:17.664 --> 05:20.170
Stress fractures
to the lumbar vertebrae

05:20.203 --> 05:22.242
indicating spondylolysis.

05:22.275 --> 05:24.139
The epiphyses
of her wrists are fused.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.180
That's why she's so short.

05:26.213 --> 05:28.379
Fracturing to the growth plate
can cause early fusion.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.020
The lunate's
blood supply

05:30.053 --> 05:32.222
must have been interrupted,
so the bone deteriorated.

05:32.255 --> 05:34.286
That explains
the need for implants.

05:34.327 --> 05:36.864
This looks like systematic
physical abuse.

05:36.897 --> 05:39.001
And there's a fracture
on the fibula

05:39.034 --> 05:40.971
that hasn't fully
remodeled yet.

05:41.004 --> 05:42.741
It's not older than seven weeks.

05:42.774 --> 05:45.204
So she was being beaten
regularly?

05:45.237 --> 05:47.643
Take a hard look
at mom and dad in that locket.

05:47.676 --> 05:50.242
One or both of them
may be our murderer.

05:57.116 --> 05:59.050
The body was placed carefully,
with respect.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.923
See the arm placement
and the gs?

06:00.956 --> 06:03.155
She wasn't just dumped
there and abandoned.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.491
So the killer took some time?

06:04.524 --> 06:06.165
If it <i>was</i> the killer.

06:06.198 --> 06:08.366
I mean, if the scenario involves
abuse by one parent

06:08.400 --> 06:09.797
resulting
in the girl's death.

06:09.830 --> 06:12.634
So the other one got rid
of the body? Oh, God.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.432
I have to consider
every possibility.

06:14.465 --> 06:16.102
Now, see that cloth?

06:16.135 --> 06:18.797
It appears it was used
to cover the victim's face,

06:18.838 --> 06:20.900
which is another sign that
the killer knew the victim.

06:20.933 --> 06:22.837
You know, looking at her
was too painful.

06:22.870 --> 06:24.574
Murdered by someone
who loves you.

06:24.607 --> 06:25.879
I'll never understand it.

06:25.912 --> 06:29.645
Yeah, neither will I.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.860
Lichtenberg figures.

06:42.893 --> 06:46.026
SAROYAN: Yeah, that's what happens when
lightning hits a human being.

06:46.059 --> 06:47.892
Even when the person
is already dead?

06:47.933 --> 06:50.531
I can't imagine
that it happens very often.

06:50.564 --> 06:52.161
You should publish
on this subject

06:52.194 --> 06:53.927
in the forensic journals,
make a name for yourself.

06:53.968 --> 06:55.200
Make a name for myself?

06:55.233 --> 06:57.135
You mean like the one
that was stolen?

06:57.168 --> 06:59.397
They caught her. It's over.
You can let it go now.

06:59.438 --> 07:02.100
Let it go?
I am nowhere near letting it go.

07:02.133 --> 07:03.405
You know what
Caroline told me?

07:03.438 --> 07:04.774
To let it go?

07:04.807 --> 07:07.646
No. She said that if I can show
that Haley stole my identity

07:07.680 --> 07:08.975
out of personal malice,

07:09.016 --> 07:10.680
then it becomes
aggravated identity theft

07:10.713 --> 07:13.154
and it can add up to three
more years to her sentence.

07:13.187 --> 07:14.450
Are you gonna do that?

07:14.490 --> 07:17.320
Definitely.
I am plenty aggravated.

07:18.825 --> 07:20.529
What?

07:20.562 --> 07:21.857
You won.

07:21.898 --> 07:23.898
All evidence shows
that the first step

07:23.931 --> 07:25.529
in healing is
forgiveness.

07:25.562 --> 07:27.868
I'm more of a
wrath-and-vengeance type.

07:29.174 --> 07:30.742
I'll take the
clothing remnants

07:30.775 --> 07:32.973
to Hodgins
if you're done.

07:33.006 --> 07:34.374
If you think about it,

07:34.415 --> 07:36.481
identity theft is like another
kind of murder.

07:41.523 --> 07:43.193
(sighs)

07:46.992 --> 07:49.357
(computer trilling)

07:58.873 --> 08:02.008
Hey, Angie. So, I found this
in the victim's clothing,

08:02.045 --> 08:04.143
and with it being blank
and everything,

08:04.176 --> 08:06.007
I thought maybe you
could access the data.

08:06.048 --> 08:07.345
Figure out
what it's for.

08:07.378 --> 08:08.756
Yeah, no problem.

08:12.858 --> 08:16.887
The lightning must have
demagnetized the card.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.127
(sighs)

08:18.161 --> 08:23.124
Okay, uh, 16-year-old
Amanda Watters.

08:23.157 --> 08:24.859
Her father, Leon,

08:24.892 --> 08:27.500
a professor
at Buchanan University,

08:27.533 --> 08:28.796
reported her missing
three days ago.

08:28.829 --> 08:30.896
What about mom?

08:30.929 --> 08:33.933
Well, Sweets says that
she might be in on it.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.703
They look nice,
these people, you know?

08:36.736 --> 08:40.339
They look perfectly normal
and nice.

08:43.144 --> 08:45.281
Dr. Watters?

08:45.314 --> 08:46.578
Dr. Watters?

08:46.611 --> 08:48.588
Just, I need
one moment, please.

08:48.621 --> 08:50.017
What's he doing?

08:50.050 --> 08:52.151
It appears
to be vector calculus

08:52.184 --> 08:54.456
and something about motion,

08:54.489 --> 08:57.856
but I don't recognize
the context.

08:57.889 --> 09:00.087
I just told him
that his daughter is dead,

09:00.128 --> 09:01.892
and he's scribbling
on the chalkboard. Dr. Watters,

09:01.925 --> 09:04.092
do you understand
what I just told you?

09:04.125 --> 09:06.891
Your daughter is dead.

09:08.761 --> 09:10.327
Are you sure it's Amanda?

09:10.360 --> 09:11.495
We're certain, yes.

09:11.528 --> 09:13.097
Would you like
to finish this first?

09:13.130 --> 09:14.232
Bones.

09:14.265 --> 09:15.399
Yes. Thank you.

09:15.432 --> 09:16.734
Just this one part.

09:16.767 --> 09:18.398
No, no, no.
Excuse me, Dr. Watters,

09:18.439 --> 09:21.775
we need to talk to you
about your daughter now, please.

09:25.310 --> 09:27.878
There. Thank you.

09:27.911 --> 09:30.748
We'll need to speak
with your wife as well.

09:30.781 --> 09:33.083
That's impossible.

09:33.116 --> 09:34.283
Why?

09:34.316 --> 09:36.052
My wife is dead.

09:36.085 --> 09:38.254
Well, that's an
awful coincidence.

09:38.287 --> 09:42.757
The concept of coincidence
is erroneous.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.263
It's possible to define
a formulation

09:45.296 --> 09:49.200
of patterned interaction between
all things within the universe.

09:49.233 --> 09:51.135
I'm sorry. Is that some kind
of a confession?

09:51.168 --> 09:53.904
No, just a fact.

09:53.937 --> 09:56.609
My wife died of breast cancer
a year ago.

09:56.642 --> 09:57.840
Can you explain why

09:57.881 --> 09:59.775
your daughter showed signs
of abuse?

09:59.808 --> 10:04.113
Amanda was a gymnast,
nationally ranked.

10:04.154 --> 10:06.783
Gymnastics could definitely
explain the damage to her bones.

10:06.816 --> 10:09.455
Did your daughter have any
troubles in school?

10:09.488 --> 10:11.390
Amanda didn't go to school.

10:11.423 --> 10:13.958
She was getting her GED

10:13.991 --> 10:16.158
from an online school
aimed toward prodigies

10:16.191 --> 10:18.127
and child professionals.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.799
You are
a very narrow-minded man,

10:19.832 --> 10:21.566
aren't you?
I'm sorry?

10:21.599 --> 10:23.733
You have an extremely limited
view of the universe.

10:23.766 --> 10:25.837
(sighs)
Agent Booth is merely

10:25.870 --> 10:28.941
applying years
of statistical probabilities

10:28.974 --> 10:31.805
to the death of your daughter.
It's a very rational approach.

10:31.846 --> 10:33.109
How's this for rational?

10:33.142 --> 10:35.646
Okay, when did you
last see your...

10:35.679 --> 10:37.150
"daughter"?

10:37.183 --> 10:38.814
Booth!

10:44.226 --> 10:47.191
Three days ago at breakfast.

10:49.034 --> 10:51.204
Which is why I reported
her missing.

10:51.237 --> 10:53.805
Are we done?

10:53.838 --> 10:57.111
Why? You don't have any
more math you'd like to do?

10:59.416 --> 11:01.247
No, I don't.

11:22.568 --> 11:24.505
BOOTH:
<i>Look, that guy is nuts.</i>

11:24.538 --> 11:25.641
<i>He's nuts.</i>

11:25.674 --> 11:26.776
He's a physicist, Booth.

11:26.809 --> 11:28.111
One of the best in the country.

11:28.144 --> 11:31.079
Those equations he had
on the board?

11:31.112 --> 11:33.951
I have to admit I couldn't
follow much of it.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.919
Yeah, well, his reactions
are psycho-- okay, Bones?

11:35.952 --> 11:38.383
His daughter died and all
he wants to do is math.

11:38.416 --> 11:40.589
What do I do when I'm upset?

11:40.622 --> 11:42.283
You bury yourself in your work.

11:42.316 --> 11:45.889
If I lost Christine and you
within a year of each other?

11:45.922 --> 11:49.225
The only way I would survive
is to do my work.

11:49.258 --> 11:51.099
I'm not even positive
that would be successful.

11:51.129 --> 11:52.792
You're saying you think
he couldn't kill anyone

11:52.825 --> 11:54.791
because he's a
massive egghead?

11:54.832 --> 11:57.159
People deal with stress
in different ways.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.934
You taught me that.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.966
You were too hard on him.

12:08.190 --> 12:10.660
The antemortem injuries
can be explainable

12:10.693 --> 12:12.092
as occupational markers.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.260
Gymnastics takes
its toll on the body.

12:14.294 --> 12:15.964
I'm just saying,
you can't be sure

12:15.997 --> 12:17.930
that the professor didn't
also abuse Amanda.

12:17.963 --> 12:19.793
I'm stating an opinion,
not a fact.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.634
Coming from your gut, which
you don't even believe in.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.107
Booth refuses to accept the fact
that I understand the professor

12:24.140 --> 12:26.435
because he and I are
quite similar.

12:26.476 --> 12:28.773
You're not a murder suspect,
that's a big difference.

12:28.814 --> 12:31.046
What I think Dr. Brennan is saying
is that she also shares this...

12:31.079 --> 12:32.581
Really? Stop.

12:32.614 --> 12:33.949
You're taking her side
because your training

12:33.982 --> 12:35.415
never told you how
this might end?

12:35.455 --> 12:37.120
This is none of my business.
Exactly.

12:37.153 --> 12:39.422
You were going to agree
with me-- weren't you?

12:39.455 --> 12:41.357
I just think that we should
approach this case

12:41.390 --> 12:43.292
like any other and focus

12:43.325 --> 12:45.492
on only the facts, nothing else.

12:45.525 --> 12:47.196
Your entire profession is
based on subjectivity.

12:47.229 --> 12:49.129
Facts haven't even entered
into your process before.

12:49.162 --> 12:52.183
That's a gross oversimplification.
Moving on!

12:52.224 --> 12:53.653
All right? Enough.

12:53.686 --> 12:55.018
Emotions are difficult
for people

12:55.051 --> 12:56.481
like the professor and myself.
(groans)

12:56.521 --> 12:58.318
Getting lost in our work
can be a refuge.

12:58.351 --> 13:00.318
Booth thinks that
that makes us weird.

13:00.351 --> 13:02.521
We're not talking about us!
Huh? Right, Sweets?

13:02.562 --> 13:03.826
I thought I was supposed
to stay out of this.

13:03.859 --> 13:05.298
Who asked you?
I just don't think

13:05.331 --> 13:06.771
you should be distracted
from looking

13:06.796 --> 13:08.332
at other suspects
because the professor

13:08.365 --> 13:10.269
operates on a level
you can't understand.

13:10.302 --> 13:11.973
We're not!
We're gonna go to her gym.

13:12.006 --> 13:14.206
We're gonna talk to her trainer
and other gymnasts.

13:14.239 --> 13:15.974
Yeah, and I'm getting a court
order to look through e-mails

13:16.008 --> 13:17.575
and chat room conversations
to see who

13:17.616 --> 13:19.417
Amanda's been talking to
at her online school.

13:19.448 --> 13:20.518
I'll be able to discern

13:20.551 --> 13:22.046
personality types
and rivalries...

13:22.087 --> 13:24.383
Good. Then we should go.

13:24.424 --> 13:26.852
What just happened there?

13:29.554 --> 13:31.489
♪ I'm ready for the night

13:31.522 --> 13:33.426
♪ Swings, clubs
and diamond rings ♪

13:33.459 --> 13:37.056
♪ After boys, shoes,
cars and designer jeans ♪

13:37.089 --> 13:40.129
♪ Lights, camera, action,
I'm ready for the movie screen ♪

13:40.162 --> 13:43.233
♪ I'm heading to the top...

13:43.266 --> 13:45.633
Would you look at that?
I know special forces guys

13:45.666 --> 13:47.938
who can't get up
that rope that fast.

13:47.971 --> 13:49.305
Look at that beam.

13:49.338 --> 13:50.505
It's barely wider than her feet.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.608
BRENNAN:
That's what makes

13:51.641 --> 13:52.776
the balance beam so challenging.

13:52.809 --> 13:53.808
It requires an extremely

13:53.842 --> 13:54.881
low center of gravity,

13:54.914 --> 13:56.010
which is why most gymnasts

13:56.051 --> 13:57.882
are not tall.
Hmm.

13:57.915 --> 13:59.083
This one,
flying through the air

13:59.116 --> 14:01.051
with the greatest of...
(yells)

14:01.084 --> 14:02.651
Ouch.

14:02.692 --> 14:03.650
Yeah, I agree.

14:03.691 --> 14:05.088
That's gonna hurt.

14:05.121 --> 14:06.655
No, no, not like that, Sharon.

14:06.688 --> 14:07.990
You'll break something.

14:08.023 --> 14:09.358
Do you want to hurt
the team like that?

14:09.391 --> 14:11.158
I've told you a hundred times.

14:11.191 --> 14:12.958
Visualize your landing.

14:12.992 --> 14:14.295
Hey, I'm sorry.

14:14.328 --> 14:15.696
No parents on the floor
during warm-ups.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.203
It distracts
the students from...

14:17.236 --> 14:18.970
Special Agent Seeley Booth, FBI.

14:19.002 --> 14:20.504
This is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

14:20.537 --> 14:22.566
Oh.

14:22.607 --> 14:24.867
I'm Dennis McIntyre, head coach.
Is something wrong?

14:24.900 --> 14:26.268
I have to ask you
a few questions

14:26.309 --> 14:27.603
about one of your gymnasts--
Amanda Watters?

14:27.636 --> 14:30.040
She's dead.
What?

14:30.073 --> 14:31.774
A-Amanda? Are you sure?

14:31.807 --> 14:34.172
Yes, I'm never wrong
about an identification.

14:34.205 --> 14:35.475
Were you close to her?

14:35.508 --> 14:37.402
We worked together
for six hours a day, minimum.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.763
And her being away for three
days, that didn't concern you?

14:39.778 --> 14:42.011
I-I assumed she was home.
She was injured.

14:42.044 --> 14:43.947
The fractured fibula
from seven weeks ago?

14:43.980 --> 14:44.979
Yeah.

14:45.012 --> 14:45.947
I-I told her to stay off of it

14:45.980 --> 14:46.979
until next week.

14:47.021 --> 14:48.317
Look, Amanda,

14:48.350 --> 14:49.990
she was the best I ever coached.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.293
Well, if she was the best,
I'm sure a lot

14:51.327 --> 14:54.258
of these other gymnasts
were jealous.

14:54.291 --> 14:55.626
Nah, I mean, my-my girls
are... they're team players.

14:55.659 --> 14:57.059
Every single one of them.

14:57.092 --> 15:00.198
Anthropologically,
that's not reasonable.

15:00.231 --> 15:01.503
Competition is paramount here.

15:01.536 --> 15:03.808
So, uh, how was
she injured?

15:03.841 --> 15:04.937
It's not gonna sound good now.

15:04.978 --> 15:06.073
Especially after
what you're

15:06.106 --> 15:07.209
assuming about my girls.

15:07.242 --> 15:08.681
One of the girls
was spotting her.

15:08.714 --> 15:10.208
Ellie Pitera.

15:10.249 --> 15:12.112
Amanda was finishing
a tumbling pass, and Ellie

15:12.145 --> 15:14.881
couldn't hold on. It was an accident.
Ellie's a good girl.

15:14.921 --> 15:16.818
Is she as good as Amanda?

15:16.851 --> 15:18.357
Amanda was ranked first.
Ellie was second.

15:18.390 --> 15:19.726
But they were friends.

15:19.759 --> 15:21.095
They were good friends.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.935
And where's Ellie now?

15:22.968 --> 15:24.463
She trains in the afternoons.
Look, I-I've know Ellie

15:24.504 --> 15:26.471
for four years, Agent Booth.

15:26.504 --> 15:28.534
She's a good girl.

15:40.287 --> 15:43.390
Did you finished what
you were working on?

15:43.423 --> 15:45.401
Dr. Brennan.

15:45.434 --> 15:47.328
Was I expecting you?

15:47.368 --> 15:49.135
No. I...

15:49.168 --> 15:51.935
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

15:51.968 --> 15:54.205
Losing your daughter,

15:54.238 --> 15:56.502
I can't imagine what
that must be like.

15:56.542 --> 15:58.543
(sighs)
Have you found who did this?

15:58.576 --> 15:59.846
Not yet.

15:59.879 --> 16:02.278
Some people think it was you.

16:02.311 --> 16:05.014
She was my daughter.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.414
Although I'm sure

16:07.454 --> 16:09.580
Agent Booth

16:09.621 --> 16:12.386
wouldn't be convinced by that.

16:12.419 --> 16:14.323
No.

16:14.356 --> 16:16.189
(sighs)

16:16.222 --> 16:19.459
Why didn't you finish
what you were working on?

16:19.492 --> 16:20.657
It's not important.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.928
It was clearly very important.

16:22.961 --> 16:24.466
Not anymore.

16:24.499 --> 16:27.432
The world will be no poorer

16:27.465 --> 16:29.566
for me not finishing it.

16:31.398 --> 16:33.733
I would find it very difficult

16:33.766 --> 16:34.964
raising my daughter

16:35.004 --> 16:38.139
without my husband.

16:38.172 --> 16:39.908
My wife Elaine,

16:39.941 --> 16:41.612
sh-she was the true parent.

16:41.645 --> 16:42.909
I loved Amanda.

16:42.942 --> 16:45.079
Love her.

16:47.322 --> 16:49.426
(sobs)

16:51.092 --> 16:53.562
But she was the one,
more often than not,

16:53.595 --> 16:55.563
taking care of me.

16:55.596 --> 16:57.029
Making sure I ate.

16:57.069 --> 17:00.668
Making sure I got
to work on time.

17:00.701 --> 17:02.035
And now you blame yourself

17:02.068 --> 17:03.802
because you didn't
protect her.

17:05.874 --> 17:09.142
It's a logical extension
of your reasoning.

17:09.175 --> 17:11.508
Although I believe that

17:11.540 --> 17:13.339
contemplating suicide is

17:13.373 --> 17:15.737
an emotional rather than

17:15.778 --> 17:18.104
a rational choice.

17:18.145 --> 17:19.440
Excuse me?

17:19.473 --> 17:20.608
People like us?

17:20.641 --> 17:23.175
We're nothing without our work.

17:23.214 --> 17:25.782
Your daughter mitigated that.

17:25.816 --> 17:27.983
With her gone,

17:28.018 --> 17:29.552
if you abandon your work,

17:29.586 --> 17:32.224
you'll have no reason to live.

17:32.257 --> 17:33.761
Well, that sounds like

17:33.794 --> 17:36.329
a supremely rational thought.

17:36.362 --> 17:39.064
However, you're leaving out
a crucial part of the equation.

17:39.097 --> 17:40.663
You do want
the person responsible

17:40.696 --> 17:42.166
for your daughter's murder

17:42.199 --> 17:44.133
to be caught, don't you?
Of course. Yes.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.867
That may not happen
if you take your own life.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.130
I don't understand.

17:48.163 --> 17:49.698
Follow the logic.

17:49.731 --> 17:51.634
If you kill yourself,

17:51.667 --> 17:53.537
the authorities will be
convinced that you did,

17:53.570 --> 17:56.538
in fact, abuse and
murder your daughter.

17:56.579 --> 17:59.779
She took care of you so
you could keep working.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.619
Not everyone understands
people like us.

18:03.652 --> 18:06.987
Inertia demands
that you keep going.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.523
For Amanda.

18:16.093 --> 18:19.301
Find who did this.

18:28.883 --> 18:31.153
Hodgins found a security card
with her effects.

18:31.186 --> 18:33.890
It's degraded but he's trying
to save the magnetic strip.

18:33.923 --> 18:35.892
You think it could tell us
where she went before she died?

18:35.925 --> 18:37.556
That's my hope.

18:37.597 --> 18:39.090
Found cause of death?
Not yet.

18:39.123 --> 18:40.529
But I separated the
perimortem injuries

18:40.562 --> 18:42.359
from any post or
antemortem ones.

18:42.392 --> 18:44.097
Look at this.

18:44.130 --> 18:46.161
See the fracturing and
the increased separation

18:46.202 --> 18:48.864
to the outer edges of
ribs six through eight?

18:48.898 --> 18:51.533
And the fracture

18:51.566 --> 18:53.637
on the posterior plane

18:53.670 --> 18:55.807
of the sternum?

18:55.840 --> 18:57.070
Signs of a struggle.

18:57.111 --> 18:58.437
Potentially.

18:58.478 --> 19:00.373
That would fit with the tissue

19:00.406 --> 19:01.450
remaining on the scalp.

19:01.479 --> 19:03.279
It showed subgaleal hemorrhaging

19:03.312 --> 19:04.511
and contusions consistent

19:04.552 --> 19:06.383
with a chunk of hair
being torn out.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.518
So she didn't go down
without a fight.

19:08.551 --> 19:10.484
Let me know
if you find cause.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.418
Are you really gonna do it?

19:12.451 --> 19:14.320
What?

19:14.353 --> 19:15.888
Up the charges against her.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.223
Absolutely. Why?

19:17.256 --> 19:19.119
I thought maybe I had
some effect on you.

19:19.152 --> 19:20.759
I'm sorry I'm not a saint.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.192
I still can't get a credit card.

19:22.225 --> 19:23.464
I get an allowance

19:23.497 --> 19:24.991
from a court-appointed
accountant

19:25.031 --> 19:26.198
like a child, and I don't want

19:26.231 --> 19:27.430
to talk about this anymore.

19:27.463 --> 19:29.695
I was persecuted in Iran.

19:29.735 --> 19:32.071
(sighs)
I lost my home.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.871
My cousin was killed
so I have an idea

19:33.904 --> 19:36.102
of what it means
to want vengeance.

19:36.135 --> 19:39.039
And I held on to that anger.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.445
I became that anger
until that's all I was.

19:41.478 --> 19:43.979
Until I decided to let it go,

19:44.013 --> 19:46.445
and realize that sometimes
the world is an unjust place

19:46.478 --> 19:48.780
that we have to accept.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.516
If I didn't decide to forgive

19:51.549 --> 19:54.787
I wouldn't have the
life I have now.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.923
I wouldn't be able to have you.

20:00.632 --> 20:02.365
Well, I guess we now know

20:02.398 --> 20:04.629
who the good person
in this relationship is.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.766
Cam...
I'll let you

20:05.799 --> 20:07.903
get back to your work.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.979
(triumphant orchestral
music playing)

20:17.180 --> 20:18.613
Wow.

20:18.646 --> 20:21.455
Okay, so how is
that even possible?

20:21.488 --> 20:23.116
She's, like, six feet
off the ground.

20:23.149 --> 20:24.749
McINTYRE: She couldn't stick
that four months ago.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.357
Broke three toes,
but she powered through it.

20:27.391 --> 20:28.494
It was a beautiful landing.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.790
That was truly incredible.

20:29.823 --> 20:33.263
Thanks.
Now, tape your ankle, Ellie.

20:33.296 --> 20:35.464
Judging by the swelling,

20:35.497 --> 20:36.737
you may have
a fracture to your talus.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.571
I know.
This is Agent Booth

20:38.604 --> 20:40.674
and Dr. Brennan, they want
to ask you about Amanda.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.709
Sure.
So, you must be, uh,

20:42.750 --> 20:44.516
really upset, losing
someone so close to you.

20:44.549 --> 20:48.017
I am, but we have a competition
in five weeks.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.848
Amanda would understand.
Is that right?

20:49.881 --> 20:51.952
I know why you want
to talk to me.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.015
Why is that?

20:53.048 --> 20:54.182
Everyone thinks

20:54.215 --> 20:55.421
that I let Amanda fall
on purpose

20:55.454 --> 20:56.886
because I wanted
to be ranked first.

20:56.919 --> 20:59.288
But she over-rotated
on a double pike.

20:59.329 --> 21:01.095
I couldn't push her
out of it in time.

21:01.128 --> 21:02.368
The fracture to Amanda's fibula

21:02.392 --> 21:04.462
could have been caused
by that.

21:04.495 --> 21:05.726
Well, we've seen
that injury before.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.293
I didn't kill her.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.166
We'd been training
together for years.

21:09.199 --> 21:10.365
She was like
a sister to me.

21:10.398 --> 21:12.500
Amanda was coming back
to practice next week.

21:12.533 --> 21:14.172
Ellie was going to help
her with her floor routine.

21:14.205 --> 21:16.470
I should really go over
to my students.

21:16.503 --> 21:18.112
Sure. Yeah.
Thank you.

21:18.145 --> 21:20.410
Thanks. Thanks.
Just... keep flippin'. Yeah.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.217
Wait up.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.920
Wait up?
I don't think Amanda was coming back.

21:25.953 --> 21:28.182
What do you mean?
She was skipping physical therapy,

21:28.215 --> 21:30.388
hanging out with
some new kids, getting high.

21:30.421 --> 21:32.220
She was in no shape
to compete.

21:32.253 --> 21:33.524
Right.

21:33.557 --> 21:34.923
Thank you.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.707
I think I found
the victim's drug connection.

21:44.748 --> 21:47.749
What? How?
I trolled her online school chat rooms.

21:47.783 --> 21:49.086
You spied on kids?

21:49.119 --> 21:50.279
You could call it
surveillance

21:50.287 --> 21:51.318
if it makes you
feel better.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.056
Tell me what
you found out.

21:53.089 --> 21:54.569
Well, a kid kept
asking Amanda Watters

21:54.593 --> 21:55.928
if she wanted
to meet Molly.

21:55.961 --> 21:57.601
She kept saying "no,"
then she said "yes,"

21:57.633 --> 21:59.467
then he asked her
if she wanted to meet Molly again,

21:59.500 --> 22:01.402
then she asked him
to meet Molly.

22:02.705 --> 22:04.334
Molly is a drug.

22:04.367 --> 22:05.734
I know.
It's a slang term

22:05.767 --> 22:08.376
for a type of, uh,
purified Ecstasy.

22:08.409 --> 22:09.842
I work in the law
enforcement industry.

22:09.875 --> 22:11.514
I-I know that, okay?
What was the kid's name?

22:11.547 --> 22:13.450
MadMolly.
His real name.

22:13.483 --> 22:15.450
Right, uh... Julian Anton.
Right.

22:15.483 --> 22:17.683
Okay, you did research on the kid,
so go question him.

22:17.716 --> 22:19.051
Okay.

22:20.893 --> 22:22.958
Nineteen?

22:22.991 --> 22:24.967
That's a little old to still be in
high school, isn't it?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.896
What are you, 22?

22:26.937 --> 22:28.599
Pretty weird
you're a suit.

22:28.632 --> 22:29.933
I don't think you were
there for the education...

22:29.966 --> 22:31.637
MadMolly.

22:31.670 --> 22:32.101
Whoa.

22:32.126 --> 22:34.036
Yeah. And we got a warrant
to search your car.

22:34.037 --> 22:35.908
You know, hiding things
in a door panel

22:35.941 --> 22:37.539
that's really loose
is really...

22:37.572 --> 22:39.740
you're not
that smart.

22:39.773 --> 22:40.980
What is that?

22:41.013 --> 22:42.708
It's not mine.

22:42.749 --> 22:44.212
We don't care about
your drugs, Julian.

22:44.245 --> 22:46.411
We care about what
happened to Amanda Watters.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.516
Oh, I never had sex
with her or nothing.

22:48.549 --> 22:50.282
And even if I did,
she was legal.

22:50.315 --> 22:51.386
She was murdered.

22:51.419 --> 22:52.891
Oh, man.
Yeah.

22:52.924 --> 22:54.219
And right now
the prime suspect

22:54.260 --> 22:55.290
is her drug dealer.

22:55.323 --> 22:56.922
I never had a problem
with Amanda.

22:56.955 --> 22:58.196
Why would
I kill her?

22:58.229 --> 22:59.892
Maybe she yelled rape?

22:59.933 --> 23:00.930
Dude!

23:00.963 --> 23:02.394
I'm not evil.

23:02.427 --> 23:04.266
Ask her friend.
She liked me.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.571
What friend?
(sighs)

23:06.604 --> 23:07.937
Rachel Howes.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.736
Was she with Amanda
last time you saw her?

23:09.769 --> 23:11.137
I never saw them apart.

23:11.170 --> 23:13.241
When was it?

23:13.274 --> 23:14.608
Okay, so, look...

23:14.641 --> 23:16.071
I realize in
the short time

23:16.112 --> 23:17.607
you and I have
formed a relationship,

23:17.640 --> 23:19.446
you have established
an opinion about me

23:19.479 --> 23:21.941
that's gonna make
what I have to say

23:21.982 --> 23:23.380
seem kind of
bad, but...

23:23.413 --> 23:25.315
it was the same day
she disappeared.

23:25.348 --> 23:26.443
They bought Molly
from you?

23:26.484 --> 23:28.218
Yes, but I refuse
to answer that

23:28.251 --> 23:30.618
on the grounds that
it might incriminate me.

23:31.516 --> 23:32.755
You just...
all right.

23:32.789 --> 23:34.420
Wow.

23:34.453 --> 23:35.755
So, the first
question is, uh...

23:35.789 --> 23:37.557
how did you get hurt?

23:37.598 --> 23:39.494
Why does that matter?

23:39.527 --> 23:40.997
Well, forensics
says that, uh,

23:41.030 --> 23:42.300
Amanda fought
her attacker.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.636
If she can explain

23:43.669 --> 23:45.565
the injuries that
she got on her arm,

23:45.606 --> 23:47.837
then I can eliminate her
as a suspect.

23:49.142 --> 23:51.310
Three days ago,
Rachel came home stoned.

23:52.511 --> 23:53.743
I slapped her.

23:53.777 --> 23:55.017
He slapped me

23:55.050 --> 23:57.122
and I fell
down the stairs.

23:57.155 --> 23:59.122
That's the truth.

23:59.155 --> 24:00.859
MAN: I saw how high she was,
then she said she was

24:00.892 --> 24:02.492
gonna quit cello, and...

24:02.525 --> 24:03.997
I overreacted to both.

24:04.030 --> 24:05.796
We work three jobs.

24:05.829 --> 24:08.028
We've given up everything
for Rachel's cello.

24:08.068 --> 24:09.162
We're in family
counseling.

24:09.195 --> 24:10.201
Please, check it out.

24:10.234 --> 24:11.497
So you get mad enough

24:11.530 --> 24:12.800
to slap your own
daughter, who you love.

24:12.833 --> 24:14.335
I can only imagine
what you would do

24:14.369 --> 24:15.703
to someone who

24:15.736 --> 24:17.270
tried to hurt
your daughter.

24:17.303 --> 24:19.007
We've never even heard
of Amanda until now.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.438
RACHEL:
That's true.

24:20.471 --> 24:23.373
I met Amanda online,
through school.

24:23.406 --> 24:26.075
You and her were doing
Molly together, right?

24:26.108 --> 24:28.475
We had fun.

24:28.508 --> 24:31.013
We just wanted
to stop being...

24:31.046 --> 24:33.619
prodigies for
a minute.

24:33.652 --> 24:37.312
It's just...
it's too much pressure.

24:40.690 --> 24:42.949
When was the last time
you saw Amanda?

24:42.990 --> 24:44.187
Just before
I went home,

24:44.220 --> 24:46.850
the night Dad and I
had our argument.

24:46.891 --> 24:48.689
Amanda was going
to tell her dad

24:48.722 --> 24:50.824
that she wanted
to quit gymnastics, too.

24:52.287 --> 24:54.652
And Amanda was gonna talk
to her father that night?

24:54.693 --> 24:56.658
We made a pact
to quit.

24:56.691 --> 24:58.953
And I never heard
back from her.

24:58.994 --> 25:01.229
So I just figured that
she chickened out

25:01.262 --> 25:03.229
and that she didn't
want to tell me.

25:06.501 --> 25:08.500
All right, now I coat

25:08.533 --> 25:10.339
the magnetic strip

25:10.372 --> 25:12.277
with carbon tetrachloride,

25:12.310 --> 25:14.741
and as it evaporates...

25:14.774 --> 25:16.077
MONTENEGRO:
That's amazing.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.846
The second barcode
should tell us

25:17.879 --> 25:19.319
where the card
is from.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.117
But it looks
incomplete.

25:21.150 --> 25:22.849
If you turn on
the laser scanner,

25:22.882 --> 25:24.649
I can upload it
and apply

25:24.682 --> 25:28.319
the software to repair
the missing barcode.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.223
HODGINS: So cello-girl's
parents spend, like,

25:30.256 --> 25:32.720
a quarter of a million dollars
on lessons, but she decides

25:32.761 --> 25:35.287
to do drugs and run off
with gymnast girl.

25:35.328 --> 25:36.557
They'd probably end up

25:36.590 --> 25:38.260
following One Direction
or something.

25:38.293 --> 25:39.826
All right, so, then,
Booth thinks

25:39.859 --> 25:42.160
cello girl's dad might have
done something worse

25:42.193 --> 25:45.524
than slap his kid
down the stairs?

25:45.557 --> 25:46.956
(computer beeping)

25:46.989 --> 25:48.661
You get something?

25:48.694 --> 25:50.534
Yeah, it's for
an access card

25:50.567 --> 25:53.534
for a building at
Buchanan University.

25:53.567 --> 25:54.765
What would she
be doing there?

25:54.798 --> 25:56.501
It's where her father works.

25:56.534 --> 25:57.973
She went into his building

25:58.006 --> 26:00.437
at 7:18 on the night
that she was killed.

26:00.478 --> 26:03.077
The dad said that the last time
he saw her was at breakfast.

26:03.110 --> 26:05.247
Well, this says that he lied.

26:09.272 --> 26:10.343
You lied to us, Leon.

26:10.376 --> 26:12.047
I don't know
what you mean.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.311
You said you didn't
see your daughter

26:13.344 --> 26:14.511
the night that
she was killed.

26:14.544 --> 26:16.414
I didn't.

26:16.447 --> 26:17.981
I was working.

26:18.014 --> 26:20.011
I was constructing
an invariant measure

26:20.052 --> 26:23.085
of the phase space of
cosmological spacetimes.

26:23.118 --> 26:24.422
I have my notes.

26:24.455 --> 26:26.252
Your notes aren't
exactly an alibi.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.819
You understand that,
right?

26:27.860 --> 26:29.323
I am telling you

26:29.356 --> 26:31.364
that I did not see
my daughter that night.

26:31.397 --> 26:33.163
She would have had to buzz me

26:33.196 --> 26:35.268
to get into
the building after hours.

26:35.301 --> 26:37.164
There's security protocol.

26:37.197 --> 26:39.201
Do you have your security
access card, Dr. Watters?

26:39.234 --> 26:41.706
Uh, I-I misplaced mine,

26:41.739 --> 26:44.171
but the guards know me, so...
Right.

26:44.204 --> 26:46.738
Well, that security access card
was found on your daughter.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.547
According to

26:48.580 --> 26:50.409
the security logs,

26:50.442 --> 26:53.947
your daughter entered
your building at 7:18 p.m.

26:56.053 --> 26:58.282
May I see that?

26:58.323 --> 26:59.586
Yeah.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.827
Did you eat that night,
Dr. Watters?

27:01.860 --> 27:03.154
I imagine so, I...

27:03.195 --> 27:04.687
Chicken,
if it was Thursday.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.292
I like predictability.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.387
That's great, I'm glad
you enjoyed your chicken

27:07.420 --> 27:08.756
and you like
predictability,

27:08.789 --> 27:09.989
but we are talking
about your daughter, here.

27:10.030 --> 27:11.399
And it says here that

27:11.432 --> 27:14.032
she entered the building at 7:18 p.m.
Yes.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.969
Dr. Brennan's right.

27:16.002 --> 27:18.876
Amanda brought me
dinner that night

27:18.909 --> 27:20.945
on her way
to practice.

27:22.242 --> 27:23.609
And you didn't
remember that?

27:23.642 --> 27:26.711
I wasn't a very
good father.

27:26.744 --> 27:30.720
I think we've established
that quite clearly.

27:30.753 --> 27:32.550
BRENNAN:
Sometimes,

27:32.583 --> 27:34.255
when we're in
the middle of work,

27:34.288 --> 27:37.025
even a loved one's
presence

27:37.058 --> 27:38.491
can be a distraction.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.962
An annoyance, even.

27:40.995 --> 27:42.667
(Booth sighs)

27:44.605 --> 27:46.971
Hmm. Maybe it was easier
to get rid of her

27:47.004 --> 27:48.371
instead of be
bothered by her.

27:48.404 --> 27:50.371
<i>I</i> would never hurt <i>you,</i> Booth.

27:50.404 --> 27:52.441
LEON:
I would have gladly

27:52.475 --> 27:54.504
given up my work

27:54.545 --> 27:56.440
to be able to relate to Amanda

27:56.480 --> 28:00.046
like a normal...

28:00.080 --> 28:02.582
parent.

28:02.615 --> 28:05.147
(sighs)

28:05.180 --> 28:06.379
I imagine

28:06.412 --> 28:07.979
I barely looked
at her that night.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.618
And I... I'm sure that
that hurt her.

28:13.323 --> 28:17.119
But I did not kill her.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.926
She would have
gotten my dinner

28:21.959 --> 28:23.997
at the Chicken Shed
on Garfield.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.262
They knew her.

28:25.296 --> 28:26.662
Talk to them.

28:32.005 --> 28:33.532
Come on. Let's go.

28:36.908 --> 28:38.338
You were like his lawyer
in there, Bones.

28:38.371 --> 28:39.938
I believe him, Booth.

28:39.971 --> 28:41.305
His behavioral patterns are
reminiscent of my own.

28:41.338 --> 28:43.505
And I am excellent at
pattern recognition.

28:43.546 --> 28:45.145
Okay, you know what?
He lied, okay?

28:45.178 --> 28:46.809
No one forgets seeing
their own daughter

28:46.850 --> 28:48.217
the night she died.

28:48.250 --> 28:49.514
There are times
I can describe

28:49.547 --> 28:51.116
a set of remains
in great detail

28:51.157 --> 28:53.493
but I can't remember
what month it is.

28:53.526 --> 28:55.323
We each survive
in our own way.

28:55.356 --> 28:57.520
Yeah, but in this case
someone didn't survive, got it?

28:57.553 --> 28:58.919
Oh, and next time,

28:58.960 --> 29:00.487
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't take

29:00.528 --> 29:02.327
the suspect's side
in the interrogation room.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.325
Thank you.

29:05.894 --> 29:07.464
(sighs)
(buzzer sounds)

29:10.738 --> 29:12.874
Cam?

29:12.907 --> 29:14.778
Oh, I-I thought
that was your name.

29:14.811 --> 29:17.041
They told me
I'd be seeing my lawyer.

29:17.074 --> 29:18.577
I know.

29:18.610 --> 29:22.480
Helps to be friends with
a federal prosecutor.

29:24.919 --> 29:26.886
What do you want?

29:29.118 --> 29:31.318
Why me, Haley?

29:31.359 --> 29:33.726
We were friends.

29:33.759 --> 29:35.262
It made it easier.

29:36.192 --> 29:37.695
Seriously?

29:37.728 --> 29:40.164
I-It was easier to steal
the identity of a friend?

29:40.197 --> 29:42.427
Much.

29:42.460 --> 29:43.698
Do you even...

29:43.731 --> 29:45.397
know the meaning
of that word?

29:45.430 --> 29:48.064
Someone you can
count on to help you?

29:48.097 --> 29:50.033
I asked you
for a loan.

29:50.065 --> 29:51.430
You're clearly
doing well,

29:51.471 --> 29:53.266
but you couldn't
be bothered.

29:53.299 --> 29:55.329
I don't know what kind of
money you think I have,

29:55.370 --> 29:56.897
but I'm on
a government salary.

29:56.938 --> 29:58.371
I have a daughter
in college.

29:58.404 --> 30:00.802
I didn't have a job.
The money you stole,

30:00.843 --> 30:02.042
the credit you used?

30:02.076 --> 30:03.579
You bought
expensive clothes,

30:03.612 --> 30:06.716
took a vacation,
bought a $5,000 watch...

30:06.749 --> 30:08.579
You wanted me to give
you money for that?

30:08.612 --> 30:11.049
And now I'm in here.

30:11.082 --> 30:12.352
So we're even, right?

30:12.386 --> 30:15.724
No. No, we will
never be even.

30:15.757 --> 30:17.460
It is gonna
take me years

30:17.493 --> 30:19.525
to crawl out from under
what you did to me.

30:21.229 --> 30:24.028
Do you have any
remorse at all?

30:24.070 --> 30:26.436
It was always
so easy for you.

30:26.469 --> 30:27.635
You got out of school,

30:27.668 --> 30:29.298
got a great job,
got promoted.

30:29.339 --> 30:30.938
I worked hard.

30:30.971 --> 30:33.441
Something you clearly
don't feel the need to do.

30:33.474 --> 30:37.070
Doing what I did is not
as easy as you think.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.476
I didn't get caught
for a year.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.307
You are unbelievable.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.073
Did you just come here
to give me a lecture?

30:46.114 --> 30:47.411
Because you can
save your breath.

30:47.444 --> 30:48.980
I came here to...

30:50.916 --> 30:53.482
You know what?
You don't need to know.

30:53.515 --> 30:55.621
(buzzer sounds)

31:00.830 --> 31:03.065
I was reexamining
the cervical vertebrae

31:03.106 --> 31:04.769
when I noticed these two
extremely subtle fractures

31:04.802 --> 31:06.671
on the C-3
and C-7.

31:06.704 --> 31:08.974
Did you measure the separation
of the two injuries?

31:09.007 --> 31:10.373
10.16 centimeters.

31:10.406 --> 31:12.069
They appear to be
subluxations

31:12.110 --> 31:14.406
caused by
hyperextension.

31:14.447 --> 31:15.808
That would mean
that she was laying

31:15.814 --> 31:17.413
on top of something
elevated and was pushed.

31:17.447 --> 31:18.982
Exactly.

31:19.015 --> 31:21.585
I know how Amanda died.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.656
Angela should be
able to confirm it.

31:23.689 --> 31:26.055
Wait, wait. How?

31:26.088 --> 31:27.654
Okay, on the right
is the victim.

31:27.687 --> 31:30.464
Can you lay her
on her back?

31:31.497 --> 31:32.496
Now, place

31:32.529 --> 31:34.663
a 10.16 centimeter-wide plank

31:34.696 --> 31:37.366
underneath
her cervical vertebrae.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.371
Raise the height of the plank
by two inches.

31:42.572 --> 31:43.970
After an initial fight,

31:44.003 --> 31:46.032
the killer got the victim
on the ground

31:46.072 --> 31:48.839
and knelt on her torso.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.639
The assailant would've
placed their hands

31:51.672 --> 31:53.943
around the victim's neck
and pushed.

31:57.247 --> 31:58.981
The strangulation over the plank
caused hyperextension fractures

31:59.014 --> 32:01.349
in the spinous processes
of the C-3 and C-7.

32:01.382 --> 32:02.749
Precisely.

32:02.782 --> 32:04.990
But what was the plank?

32:05.023 --> 32:07.390
10.16 centimeters.

32:07.424 --> 32:09.157
Four inches.

32:09.190 --> 32:11.190
It was a balance beam.

32:17.462 --> 32:18.630
Look, I know how important it is

32:18.671 --> 32:19.992
for you to keep
your team together

32:20.001 --> 32:21.369
so you must've been
pretty angry

32:21.410 --> 32:23.271
when you found out
that Amanda wanted to quit.

32:23.304 --> 32:25.309
Or compete stoned.
I would never hurt Amanda.

32:25.342 --> 32:26.806
And I know
what you're looking for.

32:26.839 --> 32:28.775
But do you have any idea
how many athletes bleed

32:28.816 --> 32:30.311
and sweat on those things?
Yes, I do.

32:30.344 --> 32:32.015
Which is why I'm
not looking for either.

32:34.851 --> 32:37.027
Found it. Vomit.

32:37.060 --> 32:39.490
Amanda was strangled
to death on this beam.

32:39.523 --> 32:41.025
McINTYRE:
But that's ridiculous!

32:41.058 --> 32:42.761
She couldn't be killed here
in front of everybody.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.562
That's right, but it was late.
You probably met her here,

32:44.595 --> 32:46.730
tried to convince her
not to quit.

32:46.771 --> 32:47.866
Look, she was going
through a rough patch,

32:47.899 --> 32:49.633
but she wasn't gonna quit.

32:49.666 --> 32:50.768
What are you doing now?

32:50.801 --> 32:53.201
BOOTH: What do
you got, Bones?

32:54.706 --> 32:57.674
During strangulation a victim
will flail and convulse.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.345
Biting themselves is
not uncommon.

33:00.378 --> 33:03.346
I believe this is a piece
of Amanda's tongue.

33:03.387 --> 33:04.952
Her tongue?

33:04.986 --> 33:06.426
I didn't kill her.
I wasn't even here

33:06.447 --> 33:08.116
that night.
I was at home.

33:08.149 --> 33:09.452
Really? You might want
to rethink that

33:09.485 --> 33:11.116
because according
to the security logs here,

33:11.149 --> 33:12.420
someone used your pass code

33:12.453 --> 33:15.052
to unlock the doors
at 8:30 p.m.

33:15.093 --> 33:17.126
Same night that
Amanda Watters was killed.

33:17.159 --> 33:19.063
Let's go, turn around.
You're under arrest.

33:19.096 --> 33:21.367
Come on.

33:26.203 --> 33:28.671
I was not in the gym that night.
You used your pass code.

33:28.847 --> 33:30.375
My pass code is an open secret.

33:30.416 --> 33:31.816
It's the word "triumph."

33:31.849 --> 33:32.911
The girls use it to sneak in.

33:32.952 --> 33:33.918
Get extra practice.

33:33.951 --> 33:35.231
Extra practice after working out

33:35.247 --> 33:36.350
for six hours a day?

33:36.383 --> 33:38.150
I find that really hard
to believe.

33:38.183 --> 33:41.126
Look, Amanda was one
of my top two gymnasts.

33:41.159 --> 33:43.127
Why would I kill her?
Why?

33:43.160 --> 33:45.160
Because she was doing drugs
and she was gonna quit.

33:45.193 --> 33:47.359
I've been working
with these girls for years.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.167
Y-You-you can ask anyone,
I'm-I am a patient man.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.230
I-I've never lost my temper.

33:57.372 --> 33:59.539
You wanted to speak
with me, Dr. Brennan?

33:59.572 --> 34:00.940
Yes, Mr. Vaziri.

34:00.973 --> 34:01.940
Did I miss something?

34:01.973 --> 34:03.171
Yes.

34:03.212 --> 34:04.339
We both did.

34:04.380 --> 34:06.515
Actually, it's time

34:06.548 --> 34:08.179
to go over the evidence again,

34:08.212 --> 34:09.282
more critically.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.574
You want to take a fresh look?

34:10.616 --> 34:12.815
Yes, I should've
said that first.

34:12.849 --> 34:15.016
Um, in strangulation death
I guess it makes sense

34:15.049 --> 34:16.353
to start with the hyoid.

34:16.386 --> 34:18.353
I agree.

34:18.387 --> 34:21.456
Note the fracture on the
right antero-lateral area

34:21.489 --> 34:22.591
of the hyoidal body.

34:22.623 --> 34:24.822
It's typical in strangulation.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.096
The microfracturing is...

34:27.129 --> 34:28.233
Unilateral.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.571
Meaning?

34:29.603 --> 34:30.866
The forces were unequal.

34:30.899 --> 34:32.873
Whoever strangled
Amanda Watters

34:32.906 --> 34:34.572
was significantly weaker
in her left hand

34:34.605 --> 34:36.043
than right.
I concur.

34:36.076 --> 34:37.610
Go through the suspects,

34:37.643 --> 34:38.803
see who matches that profile.

34:38.811 --> 34:40.074
Good job, Mr. Vaziri.

34:40.114 --> 34:41.884
Thank you.

34:41.917 --> 34:45.652
Amanda Watters was
strangled to death.

34:45.686 --> 34:47.052
So you think I did it?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.491
BOOTH:
I'm sorry.

34:48.524 --> 34:49.922
Why would you say that?

34:49.956 --> 34:51.387
Because it would take
the strength of a man,

34:51.427 --> 34:53.123
obviously,
and you think I'm violent

34:53.157 --> 34:55.061
because I lost my temper
and slapped Rachel.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.300
Which is when Rachel's
hand was hurt?

34:57.333 --> 34:59.733
Yes! Why are we going
over this again?

34:59.766 --> 35:01.900
You want to tell your parents
what happened, Rachel?

35:05.110 --> 35:08.108
We found DNA evidence
that Amanda was in Rachel's car.

35:08.141 --> 35:09.379
They were friends.

35:09.412 --> 35:10.908
In the trunk
we found the evidence.

35:10.949 --> 35:14.048
We also have evidence
that she drove Amanda out

35:14.089 --> 35:15.982
to where the body was dumped.
This is unbelievable!

35:16.022 --> 35:17.517
You're grasping!

35:17.550 --> 35:18.589
Rachel went out again the night

35:18.622 --> 35:19.989
you knocked her down the stairs.

35:20.022 --> 35:22.220
Despite her injuries,
she got into her car

35:22.261 --> 35:24.294
and she drove off.
Where'd you go?

35:24.327 --> 35:26.062
She-she just rode around.

35:26.095 --> 35:27.126
To cool off.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.829
No, she didn't.

35:28.862 --> 35:30.799
She went to Amanda's gym.

35:39.912 --> 35:41.576
Vomit.

35:46.488 --> 35:49.655
We were both quitting.

35:49.688 --> 35:52.792
We were gonna
do it together.

35:52.825 --> 35:55.194
Amanda changed her mind.

35:55.227 --> 35:57.639
I had already quit.

35:57.672 --> 35:59.072
I told my dad.

35:59.105 --> 36:01.345
And he freaked out, but...

36:01.378 --> 36:03.273
(crying):
Amanda didn't keep

36:03.314 --> 36:05.714
her part of the deal.

36:05.747 --> 36:08.681
She made it seem like...

36:08.713 --> 36:10.848
like I was crazy.

36:10.881 --> 36:12.088
Well, you were.

36:12.121 --> 36:13.625
You killed her.

36:18.661 --> 36:22.700
Amanda was my only friend.

36:24.037 --> 36:27.170
It was wrong of her
to lie to me.

36:27.203 --> 36:29.308
It was gonna be great.

36:29.341 --> 36:31.371
And then it was...

36:31.412 --> 36:33.413
it was just...

36:33.446 --> 36:36.086
nothing.

37:00.169 --> 37:02.931
Still here?

37:02.964 --> 37:06.774
You know Dr. Brennan
and paperwork.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.879
Did you see your friend?

37:08.912 --> 37:10.311
Your ex-friend I mean.

37:10.344 --> 37:11.613
I knew what you meant.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.180
And yes.

37:13.213 --> 37:14.507
Feel better?

37:14.548 --> 37:16.915
Yes, I do.

37:18.253 --> 37:19.915
I am not moving forward

37:19.948 --> 37:22.652
with the aggravated
identity theft.

37:22.685 --> 37:24.021
Really?

37:24.054 --> 37:26.261
Yes.

37:26.294 --> 37:27.792
Is it because of what I said?

37:27.833 --> 37:29.834
Yes.

37:29.867 --> 37:31.066
No, seriously.

37:31.099 --> 37:33.266
Well, because of what you said,

37:33.307 --> 37:34.587
and because I spent five minutes

37:34.606 --> 37:36.310
in a room with that woman

37:36.343 --> 37:37.743
and it was...
Confusing?

37:37.784 --> 37:39.350
Awful.

37:39.383 --> 37:41.116
That much anger and bile?

37:41.149 --> 37:42.683
I don't want to spend
one more minute

37:42.716 --> 37:44.148
in that than I have to.

37:44.181 --> 37:45.550
She stole my identity.

37:45.591 --> 37:47.991
She doesn't get my soul, too.

37:48.024 --> 37:50.425
Wonderful.

37:50.458 --> 37:53.330
You say that
like "I told you so."

37:58.942 --> 38:01.444
(crickets trilling)

38:03.647 --> 38:05.413
There you are.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.455
Oh! Um...

38:08.488 --> 38:10.087
You still irritated with me?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.087
A little.

38:12.121 --> 38:14.286
'Cause I was too hard on your
freakazoid mad scientist guy?

38:14.327 --> 38:15.990
Yes.

38:16.023 --> 38:17.262
And I think you're
still doing it.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.960
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38:19.001 --> 38:20.698
You're right. Okay, I...

38:20.731 --> 38:22.034
I didn't understand him.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.227
And I thought he was our guy.

38:23.235 --> 38:24.600
I was wrong.

38:24.633 --> 38:26.335
And I was right.

38:26.368 --> 38:27.806
Yes.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.343
It's good to say it.

38:29.376 --> 38:31.177
You were right.

38:34.081 --> 38:35.683
And you're still upset.

38:38.791 --> 38:41.386
I feel I'd like to see
how Dr. Watters is doing

38:41.419 --> 38:42.859
even though I have no excuse

38:42.892 --> 38:44.597
to check on him now
that the case is over.

38:44.630 --> 38:46.463
Well, you don't need an excuse.

38:46.496 --> 38:48.567
I'm worried
that he's gonna give up

38:48.600 --> 38:50.103
now that he's alone.

38:50.136 --> 38:51.533
Why don't you go?
Just go, all right?

38:51.566 --> 38:53.005
Go, Bones.

38:53.038 --> 38:56.176
Being kind doesn't
need an excuse, okay?

38:56.209 --> 38:59.545
All right?

38:59.578 --> 39:01.346
What should I say to him?

39:01.387 --> 39:02.483
Oh, I don't know.

39:02.516 --> 39:03.554
Luckily you two speak

39:03.587 --> 39:05.186
the same freakazoid language.

39:05.219 --> 39:06.860
(laughs)

39:24.141 --> 39:25.446
Dr. Watters?

39:28.048 --> 39:29.581
Dr. Brennan.

39:29.614 --> 39:31.052
How are you?

39:31.085 --> 39:33.687
I see you've been
hard at work.

39:35.759 --> 39:37.925
You may find this
difficult to understand,

39:37.958 --> 39:39.587
but, yes,

39:39.620 --> 39:42.124
I took your advice.

39:42.157 --> 39:45.230
I think I understand.

39:45.263 --> 39:46.628
This is Amanda?

39:46.668 --> 39:47.898
At rest?

39:47.931 --> 39:50.435
In her crib, yes.

39:50.468 --> 39:52.834
She's crawling.

39:52.867 --> 39:55.602
(laughs)
Her first steps.

39:57.842 --> 40:00.106
This circular motion...

40:00.147 --> 40:01.644
Somersaults, yes.

40:04.148 --> 40:06.316
Okay, this is a smooth,

40:06.349 --> 40:08.287
stable velocity

40:08.320 --> 40:10.255
in a gradual curve

40:10.296 --> 40:12.591
on a single plane...

40:12.624 --> 40:14.358
Ice-skating?
Good!

40:14.399 --> 40:16.594
(laughs)
Yes.

40:19.996 --> 40:21.636
Here she is being carried.

40:21.669 --> 40:24.269
On my shoulders, yes.

40:24.302 --> 40:26.973
A bicycle.

40:27.006 --> 40:30.509
Running.

40:30.542 --> 40:32.812
I'm sorry, this is beyond me.

40:32.845 --> 40:34.875
Oh, uh, trampoline.

40:34.916 --> 40:37.615
The equations for acceleration

40:37.655 --> 40:40.960
and twisting are much harder.

40:40.993 --> 40:43.457
And, see...

40:43.497 --> 40:46.466
These must be
her gymnastic moves.

40:46.499 --> 40:48.531
Tucks, straddles,

40:48.572 --> 40:51.203
swinging.

40:51.236 --> 40:54.275
Her life in movement.

40:54.308 --> 40:57.547
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.479
Thank you.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.721
Better than any speech.

41:04.922 --> 41:07.457
Any photograph.

41:09.098 --> 41:11.633
This is absolutely...

41:14.370 --> 41:16.801
...perfectly beautiful.

41:18.234 --> 41:20.570
She was...

41:20.611 --> 41:23.144
beautiful.

41:29.709 --> 41:32.077
She flew through space

41:32.118 --> 41:34.245
in perfect arcs.

41:36.483 --> 41:39.219
Perhaps that's what people mean

41:39.252 --> 41:41.554
when they...

41:41.587 --> 41:44.090
they talk about angels.

41:54.733 --> 41:56.373
(quiet laugh)

41:56.406 --> 41:58.941
At rest.

42:05.415 --> 42:07.920
Amanda's at rest again.

42:10.423 --> 42:15.423

42:23.769 --> 42:25.268
What's that mean?
