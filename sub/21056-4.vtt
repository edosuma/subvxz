00:02.219 --> 00:03.829
- A Pop original.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.920
[upbeat music]

00:07.964 --> 00:09.792
â™ª

00:12.186 --> 00:15.406
- Todd, you've been making some
interesting food choices lately.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.147
- Are you eating your feelings?

00:17.191 --> 00:18.844
- Can I have one
of your feelings?

00:18.888 --> 00:20.585
I like the powdered ones.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.848
- No, they're not feelings.
They're doughnuts.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.850
- Oh.
- I have to eat all of them.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.853
I have to gain as much weight
as quickly as possible...

00:27.897 --> 00:28.941
for Jimmy.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.900
- Does he want your skin?

00:30.943 --> 00:33.207
- Probably. They're making shoes
out of human skin in Russia.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.730
- No, he needs to use
my excess fat.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.645
He's trying to plump up
his hands.

00:36.688 --> 00:40.823
- Well, they are unnaturally
petite for a man his size.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.086
- Yeah, he's, like,
got little doll hands.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.046
- Hello. Hello.
Good morning.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.135
Hi.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.529
Um, what?

00:51.573 --> 00:53.923
What? I have lipstick
on my teeth?

00:53.966 --> 00:58.014
Oh! Oh, you star-fuckers.
Yes, this is Julianne Moore.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.842
- Hi, everybody.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.062
all:
Hi, Julianne Moore.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.064
- Ms. Moore is writing,
directing,

01:04.107 --> 01:05.848
and starring in a movie,

01:05.891 --> 01:09.199
and she's following our fearless
leader for research.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.419
- Jimmy?
- No. Staci.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.464
- Why?
Is it about loneliness?

01:13.508 --> 01:15.379
- It's about a talent booker

01:15.423 --> 01:17.599
who ends up marrying a very
rich, successful director.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.209
- Or commits suicide.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.950
all: Oh.
- I don't think so.

01:20.993 --> 01:23.474
I don't--It's not suicide.
No, I don't think we're--

01:23.518 --> 01:25.259
I don't think
she commits suicide.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.913
- Okay, well, we'll see.
I'm just gonna watch.

01:27.957 --> 01:31.003
I just have been on so many
of these late-night talk shows,

01:31.047 --> 01:33.093
and I feel like the real story
happens back here

01:33.136 --> 01:35.095
with women like Staci.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.488
- Successful, stylish,

01:37.532 --> 01:40.187
independent women
living in a man's world.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.972
- Well, I'm just gonna be here.
I'm just gonna be observing.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.756
So please pay no attention
to me

01:44.800 --> 01:47.759
and go on with, um, your--
What do you call this?

01:47.803 --> 01:50.110
- Morning meeting.
- Aw.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.503
Morning meeting--
that is so adorable

01:52.547 --> 01:54.157
and so basic.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.811
I'm gonna write that down.

01:55.854 --> 01:58.727
- All right, well, we have
a great show tonight.

01:58.770 --> 02:01.643
We have "Shark Tank's"
Barbara Corcoran.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.210
- Um, I just wanted to say

02:03.253 --> 02:04.907
that you were incredible
in "Far from Heaven."

02:04.950 --> 02:06.604
- Oh, my God, and your hair

02:06.648 --> 02:08.128
in "The Hunger Games:
Mockingjay - Part 2"--

02:08.171 --> 02:09.868
incredible.
- Thank you.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.087
- I liked "Boogie Nights."

02:11.131 --> 02:12.828
They showed it at my church,

02:12.871 --> 02:14.960
so they had to cut out
all of the dirty parts.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.179
It was really short.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.659
- Sure.

02:17.702 --> 02:18.964
- Um...hi.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.662
Can we just be
professional here?

02:20.705 --> 02:22.316
Thank you.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.187
[breathes deeply]
What are you writing?

02:24.231 --> 02:25.493
- "Control issues."

02:25.536 --> 02:27.756
Just go on.
I'm not here.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.192
- All right--
- Ignore me.

02:29.236 --> 02:32.064
- We also have comedian
Kerry Coddett.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.763
So that'll be fun
'cause I love to laugh.

02:34.806 --> 02:38.810
I love to laugh!
[laughing]

02:38.854 --> 02:40.116
[sighs]

02:40.160 --> 02:41.987
And we also have
root beer pong.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.511
Jimmy's gonna be playing it
at the end of the show.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.556
- Nice.
- So, you know, Julianne...

02:45.600 --> 02:47.645
If you want to know
what Staci's actually like,

02:47.689 --> 02:49.430
just see me
after the meeting.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.561
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:50.605 --> 02:52.346
That will not be necessary.

02:52.389 --> 02:55.131
You will not speak
to Julianne.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.002
- [muttering to herself]
- Oh, what are you--

02:57.046 --> 02:59.309
- "Authoritative,
possible racist."

02:59.353 --> 03:01.181
- Oh, no, no, no,
I am not racist.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.357
No, no, no,
Malik is a nasty woman.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.359
Um, Davis and I
are best friends.

03:05.402 --> 03:06.664
- We are?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.449
- We are homeys.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.407
- Ugh.
- Yes, yes.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.801
Okay, well, it's gonna be
a great show.

03:12.844 --> 03:17.806
So, as I say every morning,
go out, Godspeed,

03:17.849 --> 03:21.375
and remember, I am always here
if you need me.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.594
Thank you.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.597
I would, um--
I would cross out "racist"

03:26.641 --> 03:30.688
and put in
"supportive of her employees."

03:30.732 --> 03:32.647
Are you gonna write it?
- I don't think so.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.388
- I would write it.
- I'm not going to.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.085
- Oh, I think you should.
- No, I'm not going to.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.826
- Okay, let's go have
some coffee.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.480
- From Studio 9B

03:39.523 --> 03:42.047
in the heart
of New York City,

03:42.091 --> 03:44.441
it's "Nightcap with Jimmy."

03:44.485 --> 03:45.834
Tonight...

03:45.877 --> 03:47.444
fresh out of the shark tank,

03:47.488 --> 03:49.054
Barbara Corcoran.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.492
She's got big hair
and big jokes--

03:51.535 --> 03:53.668
comedienne Kerry Coddett.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.627
The drinking game
even alcoholics can enjoy--

03:56.671 --> 03:58.542
root beer pong.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.415
And now, number five
in the ratings

04:01.458 --> 04:03.025
but number one in our hearts,

04:03.068 --> 04:05.070
Here's Jimmy.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.943
[energetic brass music]

04:12.295 --> 04:15.646
- I see you're really busy,
but we need to talk.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.779
- Oh.
You want some grapes?

04:17.822 --> 04:19.041
- Are your hands clean?

04:21.957 --> 04:24.438
I want to discuss
the show's security.

04:24.481 --> 04:28.093
- With me?
- It's your department.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.095
- What would you like
to discuss?

04:30.139 --> 04:31.880
- It's abysmal.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.664
In the past two months
in this building,

04:33.708 --> 04:36.145
property theft is up 317%.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.626
- My God,
this is terrifying.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.759
- It is. Last week someone
stabbed the shish kebab vendor

04:41.803 --> 04:43.152
right outside
this building.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.893
- I don't want
to blame the victim,

04:44.936 --> 04:47.504
but his meat tastes
a lot like rat.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.333
- I'm gonna need you to take
some initiative.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.770
Figure out some ways
to bolster security

04:52.814 --> 04:54.772
and get back to me
with some ideas.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.774
- Okay.

05:01.997 --> 05:05.000
Well, now who's stealing?

05:09.744 --> 05:11.354
- Hey, Double Dragons,

05:11.398 --> 05:13.138
I need the most fattening food
you have.

05:13.182 --> 05:14.966
- Let me guess--

05:15.010 --> 05:17.142
Jimmy wants to inject your fat
into his tiny hands.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.144
- Damn, Miss Cleo.

05:19.188 --> 05:22.626
- Why didn't he want my fat?
I have milky skin, no moles.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.149
- Actually, I did notice
something on your back

05:24.193 --> 05:25.977
in the tub the other day.
- What?

05:26.021 --> 05:27.979
- Hey, "Shining" twins, I need
the fattening food.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.720
- Well, if you want
the good stuff,

05:29.764 --> 05:31.505
it's in the stars
dressing rooms.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.289
- They like to look at it
and reminisce about carbs.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.334
- Oh.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.468
- Hey, how you doing?

05:38.512 --> 05:39.948
I'm Todd.
I'm Jimmy's best friend.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.471
I'm gonna grab some
of your food here.

05:41.515 --> 05:42.951
h-ho, jackpot.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.301
Whoo!
[grunts]

05:45.345 --> 05:47.956
- You're a rude one.
What, do you live in a barn?

05:47.999 --> 05:51.089
- No, I was raised in a...
standard house.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.961
- You better slow down.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.397
Slow down right now, or you're
gonna choke to death.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.877
You're gonna
make yourself sick.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.400
- Mm-mm.
I have to gain weight

05:57.444 --> 05:58.967
'cause I'm giving my fat
to Jimmy.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.360
He's got small hands.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.796
- Well, I do know someone else

06:01.839 --> 06:03.450
with small hands--
Mr. Wonderful.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.321
- You call Donald Trump
"Mr. Wonderful"?

06:05.365 --> 06:08.933
- No, you moron. Mr. Wonderful
from "Shark Tank."

06:08.977 --> 06:10.544
By the way,
I find him very sexy.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.197
- Well, of course
you would find him sexy.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.634
You're just the type.
- Oh.

06:13.677 --> 06:14.983
- What are you getting
in return?

06:15.026 --> 06:16.680
You're giving him your fat.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.203
What are you getting in return
from this guy?

06:18.247 --> 06:20.075
- What do you mean?
Nothing.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.033
- That's not good negotiating.
What, are you a moron?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.644
He's a moron, I guess, right?
- Yeah.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.036
- Mm-mm. Jimmy said
that next time we go

06:25.080 --> 06:26.429
up to his
Hamptons beach house,

06:26.473 --> 06:28.083
I can finally use
the Jet Ski.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.693
- Use the Jet Ski?
Is that what you said?

06:29.737 --> 06:31.478
He should be giving you
the Jet Ski.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.088
You've got something
he wants.

06:33.131 --> 06:35.220
That's a sellers' market.
Name your price.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.526
What's wrong with you?

06:36.570 --> 06:38.441
- Wait a second.
You're right.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.443
- Of course I'm right.
I'm Barbara Corcoran.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.750
That's one of the many reasons
I'm everyone's favorite shark.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.882
- Ah...people like Jaws.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.015
- Time to get out of here,
and leave that food behind.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.017
Wait a minute.
Leave that cake right here.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.627
Leave that cake right here.

06:50.671 --> 06:53.935
â™ª

06:53.978 --> 06:55.937
[telephone ringing
in the distance]

06:55.980 --> 06:57.460
- Oh, hey, Penny.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.244
Oh, you didn't get me
a teddy bear.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.637
What, am I five years old?

07:00.681 --> 07:02.247
- Oh, no,
it's from Julianne.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.249
- [whispering] Is she gone?
- Kind of.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.816
She felt that her presence

07:05.860 --> 07:07.688
was affecting your ability
to act naturally.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.559
- Oh, screw her.

07:09.603 --> 07:13.476
- So she sent this nanny cam
bear to monitor your every move.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.437
- Oh, my God.
Redheads are brilliant.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.048
Thank you for being
so considerate, Julianne.

07:20.091 --> 07:23.312
- Hey.
- Hey, hey...hey, girlfriend.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.096
- Right.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.837
Okay, listen, I know you told
me, like, a million times

07:26.881 --> 07:28.926
that you didn't want me
to set you up on a date.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.059
- Oh, I never said that.
I love dating.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.626
- You hate dating.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.323
You told me
that you'd rather stay home

07:34.366 --> 07:36.456
with a bag of marshmallows
and your neck massager.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.327
- Okay, well, that's true.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.851
But I have a new,
positive outlook on life,

07:40.895 --> 07:42.679
and I would love
to date.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.464
I would love to welcome love
into my life.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.074
- You do?
Because when I asked you

07:46.117 --> 07:47.641
if wanted to be set up
on a date,

07:47.684 --> 07:49.294
you told me to mind
my own fucking business.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.471
- I didn't say "fucking."

07:51.514 --> 07:54.474
I said, "Don't mind
your business."

07:54.517 --> 07:57.085
You left out
the "don't mind."

07:57.128 --> 07:59.087
- So you're gonna go on this date this afternoon?

07:59.130 --> 08:01.002
- Oh, Jesus, what time?
I'm swamped.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.656
- [scoffs]
It's just coffee, Staci.

08:02.699 --> 08:06.094
- Hey, Staci loves coffee... and dating.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.922
- I do. I'm in.

08:07.965 --> 08:11.491
Thank you so much for thinking
about me, Malik.

08:11.534 --> 08:12.883
- Okay. Oh--

08:12.927 --> 08:14.668
Okay. Okay!

08:14.711 --> 08:16.321
Okay.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.671
- Sista!

08:20.195 --> 08:24.199
[lively trumpet music]

08:24.242 --> 08:28.856
- Okay, I think
the best form of security is...

08:28.899 --> 08:30.988
a moat.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.904
If we just put a lot of water
around our building,

08:33.948 --> 08:36.994
nobody from 57th Street
can even get in,

08:37.038 --> 08:38.909
'cause they won't want to get
their clothes wet.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.737
And we can fill it
with alligators

08:40.781 --> 08:42.783
and those
flesh-eating fish.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.132
Um...

08:44.175 --> 08:46.134
- I was thinking
more in terms

08:46.177 --> 08:48.919
of some security cameras
or a metal detector.

08:48.963 --> 08:52.575
- I could get a gun.
- No. You are not getting a gun.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.229
- You don't trust me
with a gun?

08:54.272 --> 08:56.536
- I don't trust you
with a walkie-talkie.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.189
- Ugh.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.365
I just dropped one walkie-talkie
off of the rafters

09:00.409 --> 09:03.151
and gave one person
one tiny concussion.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.501
- It wasn't just a person.
It was a toddler.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.199
- Well, exactly.
It was a tiny concussion.

09:08.243 --> 09:10.375
- Okay. Fine.

09:10.419 --> 09:13.074
I'll give you the background
test for prospective gun owners,

09:13.117 --> 09:15.076
and we'll see how great
you do on that one.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.905
- Do you think I need
a number-two pencil for that?

09:19.646 --> 09:23.171
- Well, Donny Deutsch,
this has been really great.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.086
I think I should get
back to the office.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.957
- No, no, no rush. I know you're
probably worried about me,

09:27.001 --> 09:30.308
because you think, you know,
big-time ad guy, TV personality.

09:30.352 --> 09:31.832
I carved out
some time for you,

09:31.875 --> 09:33.398
so you don't have to worry
about it.

09:33.442 --> 09:36.184
- Okay.
- Yeah. No, this is kind of fun.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.621
You know, I don't usually like
to talk about my money,

09:38.665 --> 09:41.276
but, um,
people think sometimes

09:41.319 --> 09:43.104
that, you know,
when you're rich, it's hard,

09:43.147 --> 09:44.975
and, oh, my God, and--

09:45.019 --> 09:46.455
No.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.935
It's so weird.
It's so easy for me.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.198
I just touch things,

09:50.241 --> 09:52.156
and the money pours in.
- Wow.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.984
- Sometimes I don't even have
to touch them all the way.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.073
I just kind of have to put
the tip in a little bit.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.988
- Okay. All right.
I'm gonna get the check.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.511
- Oh, no, don't get the check.
No, no.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.383
This is gonna blow you away.
- Oh.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.645
- 59.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.255
- Yeah, you're 59.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.214
- No, you would, like, think--
[chuckles]

10:06.257 --> 10:07.998
No, you would think
I was, like--

10:08.042 --> 10:09.521
I heard you're funny.
That's why you did that.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.567
You're funny,
and funny is good.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.569
I think funny
for women is great,

10:13.613 --> 10:16.224
'cause sometimes not all women
don't all--have it all.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.834
Okay, meanwhile...

10:17.878 --> 10:19.662
Okay, let me explain
something to you, okay?

10:19.706 --> 10:22.665
That's 29. I guarantee if we
called her over, she's 29.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.624
I could hit that
in a heartbeat.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.234
Honey?
Want me to show you?

10:26.277 --> 10:27.539
- No, I don't want--

10:27.583 --> 10:29.063
- No, just as, like,
a clinical--

10:29.106 --> 10:30.891
- While I'm here
having a meal with you?

10:30.934 --> 10:33.023
- Yes. No, no.
By the way, I'm here with you.

10:33.067 --> 10:36.244
I could have that,
but I have actually chosen--

10:36.287 --> 10:38.463
- Oh, my God.
- No, I want you to feel good.

10:38.507 --> 10:39.943
- No, no, I've chosen--

10:39.987 --> 10:41.771
I'm not getting up now
and going there.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.294
No, no, you're not getting this.
This is a compliment.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.687
- Thank you?
- And I am here with you.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.558
I'm sorry.
We got off track.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.125
So I like to work out.
- Yes, yes, you told me that.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.779
I can see that.
- Excuse me. Ms. Cole?

10:49.823 --> 10:51.999
Um, this just arrived
from Julianne Moore.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.696
- Oh, Jesus.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.003
- Hi, thanks for coming.
I'm Donny, by the way.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.657
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is...

10:57.700 --> 10:58.745
- Staci.
- Staci, Staci.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.877
- You're so friendly, Donny.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.879
I'm having fun.
This is a fun date.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.489
- But you know what happens
a lot of times in restaurants?

11:04.533 --> 11:06.056
I kind of wait
to sense it,

11:06.100 --> 11:07.667
'cause people know
about my body and stuff,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.277
and sometimes people
are expecting me to...

11:09.320 --> 11:10.713
get a little
more comfortable.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.497
- Oh, my God.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.499
You're not taking your shirt off
in a restaurant, right?

11:14.543 --> 11:16.719
- No, the undergarment
is still on, but this is...

11:16.763 --> 11:18.373
- Look at you.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.157
- You know, when you're
in the public eye

11:20.201 --> 11:21.768
and you start morphing
into what people expect--

11:21.811 --> 11:23.813
This is kind of something.
- That's amazing.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.902
I've never been
on a tank top date before.

11:25.946 --> 11:28.557
It's fun and whimsical
for all of us girls here.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.428
- It is. And sometimes
we go out dancing.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.735
- This is so fun,
just going on a date,

11:32.779 --> 11:34.476
just once of Staci's dates.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.217
- Right. Okay, one more thing.
- What?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.349
- Souvenir, souvenir for you.
Get your camera out.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.916
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.091
- What am I doing?
- Come on.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.093
This is for your friends,

11:43.137 --> 11:44.965
'cause they're never gonna
believe you went out with me.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.749
- I'm gonna put it in a frame
in my office.

11:46.793 --> 11:47.968
- [smooches]
[camera shutter clicks]

11:48.011 --> 11:49.796
- From our date.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.580
- [groaning]

11:51.623 --> 11:53.756
Mmm.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.932
[groaning]

11:55.976 --> 11:58.108
I'm thinking Jimmy
should get me a Jet Ski.

11:58.152 --> 12:01.198
- Jet Skis are boring.
What about a self-driving car?

12:01.242 --> 12:03.331
- Oh, yeah, those are cool.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.941
But if I run someone over
with it,

12:04.985 --> 12:06.595
who goes to jail--
me or the car?

12:06.638 --> 12:08.902
- The car.
- Awesome.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.556
- What's awesome?
- Todd is trying to figure out

12:11.600 --> 12:13.515
what to get from Jimmy
for his fat.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.343
- Um, I would hand him
a Sephora catalog

12:15.386 --> 12:17.562
and be like,
"One of everything, please."

12:17.606 --> 12:20.304
[grunting goofily]

12:20.348 --> 12:22.393
- I don't know what--
- Todd...

12:22.437 --> 12:25.309
I'm not sure about this whole
fat-transferring thing.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.789
What does your doctor say
about it?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.138
- I haven't talked
to any doctor.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.879
Jimmy tells me
I'll be fine.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.969
- No, Todd, you have to talk
to somebody about it.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.276
It's not a joke.
- I don't have a doctor.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.539
- Then you need to fine one.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.975
- Where do I find a doctor?

12:39.019 --> 12:41.369
Oh, yeah.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.632
I know a guy.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.982
[cheers and applause]

12:46.026 --> 12:49.377
- So what happens in menopause
is not only depletion

12:49.420 --> 12:51.814
of sex hormones like estrogen
and progesterone,

12:51.858 --> 12:53.381
but a compromised thyroid--

12:53.424 --> 12:55.949
- [grunts]
Oh, me.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.820
- I'm not taking questions
quite yet.

12:57.864 --> 13:01.302
All right, so some women
experience hot flashes.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.391
They get weight gain.
Then there's vaginal atrophy.

13:03.434 --> 13:06.002
- I'll be super quick, man.
[clears throat]

13:06.046 --> 13:07.395
- Where'd you get
that microphone from?

13:07.438 --> 13:09.005
- Oh, "Nightcap" next door.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.486
I work there. I'm, like,
best friends with Jimmy.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.053
- I'm trying to shoot
my show.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.576
- Oh, yeah, you're doing
a great job.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.796
You're killing it, man.
[chuckles]

13:16.839 --> 13:19.755
- [sighs]
What's the question?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.627
- Um, is donating fat
to another person dangerous?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.629
- We're talking
about menopause.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.718
What does that have to do
with menopause?

13:26.762 --> 13:29.025
- All right, uh,
if a 50-year-old lady

13:29.069 --> 13:31.854
donates her fat
to another 50-year-old lady,

13:31.898 --> 13:33.508
is that dangerous?

13:33.551 --> 13:35.031
- Yeah, it's dangerous.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.033
You can get vein clots
in your legs.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.556
They can fly up to your lungs.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.297
It's called
a pulmonary embolism.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.343
You can die from that.
That's not a good idea.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.431
- What?
- Yeah.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.563
- No, I don't want to die.

13:45.607 --> 13:48.262
All right, I'm gonna tell Jimmy
I'm not gonna do the surgery.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.046
Hey, thanks, Dr. Oz.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.570
You know what? You truly are
a wonderful wizard.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.355
Okay, I got to get
back to work.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.226
Sorry about that.
Excuse me. Sorry about that.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.838
- I thought
we had security here.

14:01.971 --> 14:05.148
[lively trumpet music]

14:11.763 --> 14:13.940
- Are you ready for your
gun safety test results?

14:15.942 --> 14:19.815
[gum balls clattering]

14:22.209 --> 14:23.993
Question one...

14:24.037 --> 14:25.821
When handling firearms,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.389
always assume every firearm
to be loaded.

14:28.432 --> 14:32.610
You wrote, "No, look down the
barrel and see what's what."

14:32.654 --> 14:35.004
- Oh, I also should've put,

14:35.048 --> 14:37.615
"You can shine a light
down there, too."

14:37.659 --> 14:39.095
My bad.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.925
-Question two:

14:42.969 --> 14:45.014
"It is okay to be reckless
with your firearm

14:45.058 --> 14:47.103
"as long as you know
how to handle it

14:47.147 --> 14:48.844
and feel confident
using it."

14:48.888 --> 14:50.411
You just drew
a picture of yourself

14:50.454 --> 14:52.065
shooting two Uzis
in the air.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.328
- Yeah, but look how confident
my face is.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.417
- You didn't get
any of these correct,

14:56.460 --> 14:58.114
not a single one.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.463
You didn't even fill in
your name correctly.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.031
- Sometimes I spell it
F-I-L-L,

15:02.075 --> 15:03.685
'cause it's whimsical.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.948
- Please look in
to additional security cameras.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.516
Think about
a metal detector.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.648
Hell, I'll even take a moat
at this point.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.042
But whatever you do,
forget about getting a gun.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.739
Do you understand?

15:14.783 --> 15:17.438
- Jeez, you anti-gun nuts
are so intense.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.440
Here...

15:19.483 --> 15:22.182
take some chewy balls.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.880
They taste great,
and they never dissolve.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.362
[chewing loudly]

15:30.407 --> 15:32.670
- Okay, guys, I don't usually
like to reveal myself

15:32.714 --> 15:34.150
so early in the process,

15:34.194 --> 15:36.065
but I think
that I have something

15:36.109 --> 15:37.980
with this Staci character,
but I need your honest feedback.

15:38.024 --> 15:41.244
Okay? Just be--please, please,
completely honest.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.680
- Totally.
- Okay. All right.

15:42.724 --> 15:43.768
Um...
[clears throat]

15:43.812 --> 15:46.467
This is a phone, okay?

15:46.510 --> 15:48.077
Okay.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.471
Karen, you got to get me
Matt Damon.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.039
[sighs] You got to be
fucking kidding me.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.302
You got to be
fucking kidding me!

15:55.345 --> 15:56.999
- Yes.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.479
- No, no, Karen, please, please.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.002
No, no, I'm--
no, I understand.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.700
I totally understand,
but listen, Karen...

16:02.744 --> 16:04.964
[whispering]
See, the show is my life.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.096
- Kerry, I have to talk to you
about your set.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.924
- Sure, sure,
but check this out.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.926
Julianne Moore is work-shopping
a new character--

16:10.970 --> 16:12.754
some crazy woman
that works here, I guess.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.060
- You can't?
You really can't?

16:14.103 --> 16:15.278
Maybe next time?

16:15.322 --> 16:18.542
[groans]
Okay, bye.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.109
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.589
- That was...

16:21.632 --> 16:23.852
[applause]

16:23.895 --> 16:25.419
- Ridiculous.
- I thought so.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.725
I thought I had it, but...
- I mean...

16:27.769 --> 16:29.727
when you put
the effortless beauty aside,

16:29.771 --> 16:31.991
it really felt like Staci.
- Yeah.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.905
- Okay. All right.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.690
Okay, Julianne Moore, I need
to speak to you right now.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.605
- Okay, Julianne Moore, I need
to speak to you right now.

16:37.648 --> 16:38.998
- In private.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.521
- I need to speak to you
in private.

16:40.564 --> 16:41.739
- Stop doing--

16:41.783 --> 16:44.742
[applause]

16:48.007 --> 16:50.009
- What are you doing here?

16:50.052 --> 16:51.401
- Oh, hi, Sonya.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.316
I need one of those
teddy bear cameras

16:53.360 --> 16:54.970
like Staci has in her office.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.538
- Why you look
so pale and weak?

16:57.581 --> 17:01.716
- Well, the weak part is because
my body doesn't make muscle.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.284
- No, fool.
Why weak like sad?

17:04.327 --> 17:08.157
- Oh. Some know-it-all thinks
I'm doing a bad job in security.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.985
- Security?
[chuckles]

17:10.029 --> 17:12.161
Nothing's secure.

17:12.205 --> 17:13.858
Nothing.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.165
- I want to beef up security
around here,

17:16.209 --> 17:18.776
but for some reason,
they won't let me have a gun.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.778
- I started carrying a gun
when I was nine.

17:20.822 --> 17:24.652
Was with the secret police
when I was 11.

17:24.695 --> 17:28.438
Killed three enemies
of the state when I was 15.

17:28.482 --> 17:31.050
Had to miss my prom.
both: Mm.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.052
Wait here.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.149
- A crossbow?

17:43.192 --> 17:45.194
- Mm, from "The Walking Dead"
sketch.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.630
You know how to use?

17:46.674 --> 17:49.198
- Yeah, Daryl's
my favorite character.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.592
- Ooh, I am sensing a rise
in testosterone,

17:51.635 --> 17:53.594
and it isn't me.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.423
- [deep voice] I'm sensing
a spike in something myself.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.120
- Impressive, Phil.

17:58.164 --> 18:01.384
- Oh, God, I never felt
more like who I am

18:01.428 --> 18:03.865
until I held this
in my arms.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.737
both: Listen to me.
I am at the end of my rope.

18:06.781 --> 18:09.566
I have let you shadow me, and
you've just made me feel bad.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.307
I want it to stop!

18:11.351 --> 18:13.004
- Oh, that's it.
That's the end of my movie--

18:13.048 --> 18:14.571
a mental breakdown.
- No, no, no.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.312
both:
This is not a mental breakdown.

18:16.356 --> 18:19.010
This is me having had enough
of Julianne Moore.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.273
I want you gone!
- Gone!

18:20.316 --> 18:22.144
[click]
[gasps]

18:22.188 --> 18:23.580
- [normal voice]
My bad!

18:23.624 --> 18:25.800
- Ow!
- Oh, Jesus.

18:25.843 --> 18:28.063
- I will dispose
of the weapon.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.239
- Oh, that looks--Jesus.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.372
I can't go to jail again.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.156
â™ª

18:34.200 --> 18:37.725
[monitor beeping]

18:37.768 --> 18:40.771
- I'm setting up cameras
around the studio...

18:40.815 --> 18:42.295
to watch you.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.340
- Well, joke's on you.
I like being watched.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.037
Enjoy the show.

18:46.081 --> 18:48.388
- Oh, my God, she's coming to,
she's coming to.

18:48.431 --> 18:49.954
Do we have our stories
straight?

18:49.998 --> 18:51.913
- Phil shot her in the chest
with a crossbow.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.436
- Right.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.569
- [inhales deeply,
groans softly]

18:55.612 --> 18:58.267
- There's
my freckle-faced girl.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.008
both: Hi.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.314
- Ah, you're so pretty.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.664
- It hurts so much.
- I know.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.448
- And a long,
complicated lawsuit

19:05.492 --> 19:07.233
won't make
you heal any faster.

19:07.276 --> 19:08.886
- [grunts haltingly]

19:08.930 --> 19:10.540
That is not me
being racist.

19:10.584 --> 19:13.674
- I know, Staci.
You're a good person.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.284
- I know.

19:15.328 --> 19:16.894
- I'm not gonna sue.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.635
I'm not gonna sue, you guys.

19:18.679 --> 19:22.465
I mean, I-I just want
to thank you guys.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.119
- Oh.
- You're welcome.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.034
- You're welcome.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.297
- Yeah, 'cause you've given me
the perfect ending to my movie.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.908
No one would expect
a crossbow death

19:30.952 --> 19:33.259
in a modern indie
character study.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.478
- [gasps]
That's exactly right.

19:35.522 --> 19:36.958
She has an excellent point.

19:37.001 --> 19:39.482
- Oh, sweet.
She's alive.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.397
Hey, we're wearing
the same dress.

19:41.441 --> 19:42.920
- Oh, no.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.922
- Um, what are
you doing here?

19:44.966 --> 19:47.925
- Oh, yeah, I wound up donating
my fat to Jimmy after all.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.276
He gave me those, like,
puppy-dog eyes.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.495
He's like, "You can use
that Hamptons Jet Ski

19:52.539 --> 19:55.324
anytime you want
during the month of January."

19:55.368 --> 19:56.891
Oh, Julianne,
you know what?

19:56.934 --> 19:59.937
I got some extra fat
left over here,

19:59.981 --> 20:01.983
you know, if you want
to fill in that arrow hole.

20:02.026 --> 20:04.159
- Oh, no, I'm good.
- Okay.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.640
- You can make a candle
out of it.

20:06.683 --> 20:09.947
- That is brilliant,
Julianne Moore.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.732
Damn.
- Right?

20:11.775 --> 20:15.257
- Right! Oh, my gosh.
Happy endings all around.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.303
Okay, we have a show
in 45 minutes.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.567
So you rest.
- It's got wheels.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.959
- Yeah, keep pushing the button
on the drip.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.483
- Okay.
- So pretty.

20:23.526 --> 20:24.875
- Yeah, thank you.
- So pretty.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.748
[monitor beeping]

20:27.791 --> 20:31.186
- Would you mind signing
my arrow?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.971
[woman speaking indistinctly
over PA]

20:34.015 --> 20:38.237
The guys in my bowling league
are gonna go crazy about this.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.282
I shot you.
- Thank you.
