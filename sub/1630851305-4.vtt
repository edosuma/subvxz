11:04.580 --> 11:05.581
Name's Kevin.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.541
Yeah. Of course.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.794
The cheese does not help.

11:10.586 --> 11:15.049

you can laugh over a bowl of cold cereal.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.935
We've antagonized the master chef.

11:26.018 --> 11:26.852
Not good.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.024
Did he use this instead of salt?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.567
Oh, wow.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.861
I guess he has been working too hard.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.157
[David] Got it.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.785
Perfectly aged Asiago.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.162
Wow. It didn't come with its own truck?

11:45.246 --> 11:47.373
We should get back
before the hunters get restless.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.417
Okay, uh, almost done with the seating.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.626
Ooh...

11:50.709 --> 11:53.796
Tell me you didn't put the Harbin-Smythes
with the Pimlico-Sullivans.

11:53.879 --> 11:54.880
[Megan] Nope.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.008
Nor the Heath-Hollingsworths
with the Karps

11:58.092 --> 12:01.095
or the William-Johnsons
with any other Johnsons.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.931
Ah, Peck Jenga. My mother's favorite game.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.891
She's not gonna give us any more, is she?

12:05.975 --> 12:09.311
Depends what happens between her
and her friends before the wedding.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.730
Guessing she's not gonna be
your maid of honor?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.649
[gasps] Now, there's a solution!

12:13.732 --> 12:17.153
-To what? I'm kidding.
-To my dilemma!

12:17.236 --> 12:19.947
She's still trying to decide
if it should be Bree or Abby.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.408
-Maybe I should ask both of them.
-Mm-mm.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.577
No, it'll look like I can't decide.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.580
If I pick one,
it'll look like I'm slighting the other.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.207
What would the Heath-Hollingsworths say?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.500
Knock it off.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.252
-Can you decide?
-Me?

12:33.335 --> 12:34.253
Okay, kidding.

12:34.336 --> 12:37.047
That would be abdicating
my responsibility.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.467
-Which wouldn't be a bad thing, would it?
-It would.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.219
-I have to decide, don't I?
-[Megan] Mm-hm.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.265
Well, let's talk about it while we go
feed some Snally Hunters.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.434
Maybe Kevin and Sarah had the right idea.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.351
What's that?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.187
We take our cheese and elope.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.147
Uh, no.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.607
Don't you dare.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.862
This is exactly as I remember it.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.947
I'm so glad we did this.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.282
Me too.

13:04.033 --> 13:07.661
The last time we were here,
we moved a lot further in a day.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.332
Well, it's not the length of the journey,
it's the quality of the steps.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.167
Face it, Mick. We're old.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.545
No, old is in your head.
I feel like I'm 18 inside.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.549
Me too, then I walk by a mirror
and I see Dad looking back at me.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.927
Yeah, you do look like him.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.179
You always say that.
You look more like him.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.015
Well, he was a strong, handsome man.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.559
Whatever happened to men?

13:30.643 --> 13:31.477
What?

13:31.977 --> 13:35.147
Dad built his own house,
put in the plumbing.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.108
He was up fixing the roof
in his late fifties.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.735
Drove Mom crazy when he'd do that.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.738
Always told him he was gonna
break his neck and he'd say:

13:42.821 --> 13:45.449
[both "I fully intend to die in my sleep."

13:46.283 --> 13:48.410
That's exactly what happened.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.954
I wanna go that way.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.581
What is it with you with aging and dying?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.625

13:54.708 --> 13:55.543
Never.

[chattering]

14:02.841 --> 14:05.553
Welcome to Eagle Point
and a weekend of Snally Hunting.

14:05.636 --> 14:06.470
Thank you.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.265
-[Jess] Hi.
-Wow.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.726
And what are those?

14:12.810 --> 14:15.938
-Snally Snacks. Care to try one?
-Hm. Don't mind if I do.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.277
I unloaded about 1000 pounds.
What are these people bringing?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.195
Telephoto lenses,

14:23.279 --> 14:24.738

-Yeah.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.246
As serious as Teddy Roosevelt
when he did this.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.873
-He did?
-Look it up.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.709
I'm getting to know
an important side of you before we marry.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.168
You can't back out now.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.629
Mmm. So good.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.881
-Did you make these?
-Yes.

14:41.964 --> 14:46.093
They're my special mini-cornbread muffins
with extra Asiago cheese.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.512
Shh, shh. They're Snally Snacks.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.222
They're Snally Snacks.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.392
-Mind if I take some? Mm.
-Sure. There's plenty.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.103
You gonna bring some to Dad
and Uncle Thomas when they get home?

14:56.186 --> 14:58.230
Mm. That is a very good idea.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.442
-Can I have a few more too, please?
-Coming right up.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.072
I have to find a way around
Arthur Driscoll's defenses.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.241
-I think these are gonna do it.
-I gotta ask.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.869
Why are you so interested in Driscoll?

15:11.952 --> 15:15.456
He's one of the foremost landscape artists
of the mid-20th century.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.834
It's like I discovered a trove
of Edward Hopper's paintings.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.253
Andrew Wyeth's paintings.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.048

15:24.131 --> 15:25.382
-[gasps] Oh. Wow.
-Mm!

15:25.466 --> 15:28.218
Bringing him back to prominence
would be such an achievement.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.554
-Catching the snallygaster?
-[Megan] Mm.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.847
Only better.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.267
But I'm not just doing this for myself.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.602
I'm doing it for the world.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.146
That's what the Snally Hunters say.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.025
Him calling me Karl, that's one thing.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.151
But that chili?

15:44.234 --> 15:45.110
Come on.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.445
We all do stuff like that.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.571
Do we?

15:47.655 --> 15:48.614
Do we really?

15:48.697 --> 15:51.533
Gahagan had a partner named Karl.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.785
He died on the job.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.454
Probably just remind him of him.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.040
-See, now I feel bad.
-You should.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.712
Gahagan's always been a mentor to me.
I love the guy.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.464
What if something's wrong with him?

16:06.799 --> 16:10.177
If you're so worried about him,
why don't you talk to him?

16:10.260 --> 16:12.638
No, you're probably right. It's nothing.

Please, Mr. Driscoll.
I just need a few moments of your time.

I grew up here on the Shores.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.453
They do it on TV.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.581
[phone beeps]

21:32.124 --> 21:33.667
-Huh.
-What?

21:34.167 --> 21:35.127
There's no signal.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.211
Are you kidding?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.505
All those apps
and you can't make a phone call?

21:39.006 --> 21:40.132
Try your phone.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.258
Okay.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.761
Nope. Mustn't be any towers around.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.054
Great.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.849
Tell you what. I'm gonna go
up there and find a signal.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.017
You just sit tight.

21:50.100 --> 21:54.479
-You're never gonna make it up there.
-Hey, never say never to an O'Brien.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.735
Oh!

22:00.819 --> 22:02.154
[grunts, then groans]

22:05.324 --> 22:07.534
Yeah, you're right. I can't do it.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.536
-No way.
-At least you tried.

22:09.619 --> 22:10.704
Yeah.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.247
[groans] Oh, no.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.168
[sighs] I think I hurt my shoulder
on the second fall.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.547
You have any aspirin
in that massive pack of yours?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.425
Yeah, I got some, uh,

22:23.508 --> 22:24.885
anti-inflammatories.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.094
You take those too?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.847
Yeah, I've got a little arthritis
in my knees.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.016
Really? I got it in my elbow.

22:32.309 --> 22:33.727
All right. Here.

22:33.810 --> 22:34.686
Thanks.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.230
-Okay.
-Take three.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.274
-Gonna take a couple too.
-Cheers.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.365
-What's up?
-Hey, I need a favor.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.993
-What's that?
-Can you tell me...

22:51.369 --> 22:55.040
how important it is to have
an original copy of this?

22:57.626 --> 23:01.713
Looks like you have a properly
recorded copy, so not very.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.925
People lose property deeds all the time.
That's why they record them.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.344
Mr. Chang, who's driving me crazy,

23:07.427 --> 23:10.472
is insisting we have the original
for his high-rise.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.057
I can't find it anywhere.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.266
What do you suggest?

23:13.350 --> 23:15.102
I suggest you find it.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.561
Oh, great.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.772
-What you doing tomorrow?
-Why?

23:19.356 --> 23:21.108
Wanna help me look for it?

23:21.191 --> 23:22.526
I will buy you dinner.

23:22.609 --> 23:25.070
-Phillip's Crab House?
-Ugh. Fine.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.155
-Deal.
-Okay, thank you.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.281
No problem.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.119
[pensive music playing]

23:32.202 --> 23:33.829
Abby? Abby!

23:33.912 --> 23:34.871
Hey.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.748
-You see that car?
-Yeah.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.917
-See that guy taking pictures out of it?
-Yeah.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.086
Don't you think that's a bit suspicious?

23:41.169 --> 23:45.632
Connor, we have inspectors and competitors
taking pictures of our sites all the time.

23:45.715 --> 23:46.967
But have you seen that guy?

23:47.050 --> 23:50.095
See? Look. There he goes.

23:50.595 --> 23:54.349
That's Barrett with the county inspectors.
He takes pictures of all our sites.

23:55.100 --> 23:55.976
Oh.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.688
I'm sorry. Um...

23:59.771 --> 24:01.857
Things have been weird at work.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.276
I got invited by one
of the main partners for drinks.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.862
I don't know if I can trust the guy
at all.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.531
Don't think I can trust anybody
at that place.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.324
You sound seriously paranoid.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.119
I will still buy you dinner
if you help me tomorrow.

24:14.202 --> 24:16.329
Three words. All-you-can-eat.

24:16.413 --> 24:17.873
That's four words.

24:27.215 --> 24:31.136
Hey! We're gonna be practicing
for the triathlon this weekend.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.637
Wanna time us?

24:32.721 --> 24:33.972
Yeah, sure.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.851
Gertie, have you seen my car keys?

24:37.934 --> 24:39.060
[Gertie] Check your desk.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.688
I know I just had them.
See them over there?

24:41.771 --> 24:42.814
Uh...

24:44.149 --> 24:45.734
No, they're not here.

24:45.817 --> 24:46.776
Shoot!

24:48.403 --> 24:51.072
Shoot. It's always
the last place you look.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.574
I'm sure they'll turn up.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.702
-Grab me an iced tea from the fridge.
-Sure.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.959
[pensive music playing]

25:09.841 --> 25:13.011
Like I said,
always the last place you look.

25:13.094 --> 25:14.721
Toss them over, Karl.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.308
It's Kevin, captain.

25:19.517 --> 25:20.352
Sure it is.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.520
Slip of the tongue.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.657
[cell phone ringing]

25:35.033 --> 25:37.202
[Abby] Hello, Evan. It's a Saturday.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.329
Oh, where I am, it's a Sunday.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.789
Listen, I was thinking.

25:40.872 --> 25:44.042
Instead of the brewery facing east,
I think it should face west.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.253
Wait, that would change our entire layout.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.588
You are a stickler for details.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.466
West-facing buildings have lower heating
and cooling costs.

25:51.549 --> 25:55.136
I know, but can we talk about this later?
I need to pick up my kids.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.054
Oh.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.847
-From where?
-Taekwondo.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.809
Ah. The way of the hand and the foot.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.395
You take taekwondo?

26:03.478 --> 26:04.854
No, but I've thought about it.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.608
[sighs]

26:11.027 --> 26:12.779
[instructor] Okay, kids, final move.

26:12.862 --> 26:13.822
Roundhouse kick.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.407
Who wants to demonstrate?

26:15.490 --> 26:17.284
Carrie. Great. Give me three.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.167
Great job. Put her there.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.004
Now, everyone. One kick and you're done.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.678
Good job, everyone. See you next week.

26:37.178 --> 26:38.513
So good.

26:41.099 --> 26:41.933
Tough day?

26:42.017 --> 26:43.476
A long day.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.896
Go ahead, give it a good sock.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.690
Uh, no, I'm okay.

26:48.773 --> 26:49.858
[both] Do it, Mom!

26:49.941 --> 26:51.192
Yeah, come on.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.073
Come on, you've got to have
more than that in you.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.701
Whatever's on your mind, leave it here.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.876
That felt kind of good.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.879
[upbeat music playing]

27:13.423 --> 27:15.550
That felt really good. [laughs]

27:15.633 --> 27:18.595
We have an adult class
if you wanna give it a try.

27:18.678 --> 27:19.679
Uh...

27:21.389 --> 27:23.558
You know, I might do that.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.561
Okay, let's go. Come on.

27:30.982 --> 27:31.941
This is good.

27:32.025 --> 27:32.859
This works.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.362
It's only slightly agonizing.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.279
Okay.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.074
You know, I have an idea.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.034
If I can work my way up to that tree,

27:41.117 --> 27:44.704
I'll use a bowline
and I'll tie the carabiners on it,

27:44.788 --> 27:47.082
create a pulley system,
throw the line down to you,

27:47.165 --> 27:50.085
put a couple half hitches
around your waist, possibly a slip knot,

27:50.168 --> 27:53.838
and pull you up.
The problem is how to get up to that tree.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.757
But I think I have an idea.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.509
Are you listening, Thomas?

27:58.009 --> 27:58.968
Thomas?

27:59.886 --> 28:00.970
Thomas?!

28:01.054 --> 28:02.097
Right here, Mick.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.224
What?

28:05.475 --> 28:07.102
How did you--? You were--

28:07.185 --> 28:10.271
Turns out there's a path
that winds around the trees

28:10.355 --> 28:11.898
and comes out up here.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.067
Oh.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.571
The carabiner thing
would have really worked.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.449
I'm sure it would have.
Path's off to your left.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.368
Okay.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.164
[Gahagan]
Look, I know I ordered six command boards,

28:28.248 --> 28:31.584
five radio chest packs,
and a dozen helmet shrouds.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.253
Two weeks ago.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.922
No. Look, I'm outfitting a new rig.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.841
I need that gear here tomorrow.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.346
Oh, hey! What's up, Kevin?

28:44.389 --> 28:46.015
-I'll come back.
-No.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.601
It's okay, come on in. Come on in.

28:52.939 --> 28:56.151
I was just wondering if everything's okay.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.697
Sure. Yeah. Yeah, what do you mean?

29:02.115 --> 29:03.658
I don't mean to overstep.

29:05.368 --> 29:09.372
I've noticed that you've been forgetting
a lot of stuff lately.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.749
Nothing big, but--

29:11.791 --> 29:13.001
The keys.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.045
Yeah, the keys.

29:16.129 --> 29:16.963
Yeah.

29:18.339 --> 29:19.174
Yeah.

29:19.841 --> 29:20.675
Forgetful.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.553
Yeah, listen. Um...

29:24.137 --> 29:25.221
Just between us,

29:26.389 --> 29:29.309
I've been having a heck of a time
sleeping lately.

29:29.392 --> 29:32.020
I'm just up all night, flipping channels.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.814
-That's rough.
-Yeah.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.816
But it's not a big deal.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.403
I've been meaning to ask
my doctor for something,

29:40.487 --> 29:44.616
but with outfitting the new rig and all,
I've just been going non-stop.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.327
I appreciate you caring.

29:49.829 --> 29:51.164
We all care, cap.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.545
-Okay.
-Okay. Heh.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.216
And do me a favor.

30:03.384 --> 30:04.469
Um...

30:04.552 --> 30:07.764
If I forget something,
you tell me about it, okay?

30:08.264 --> 30:10.391
But keep it between you and me.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.811
Just until I figure this whole thing out.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.147
You'll do that, won't you?

30:17.106 --> 30:18.983
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

30:20.068 --> 30:20.902
Thank you.

30:22.070 --> 30:22.904
Kevin.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.959
[poignant music playing]

30:43.633 --> 30:46.845
Um... Hey! Thanks for coming in
to help on a Sunday.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.180
Yeah, no worries.
Helps me take my mind off work.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.766
-Plus, you gotta find that deed.
-Mm-hm.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.268
We do.

30:53.351 --> 30:56.729
Mr. Chang is threatening to shut down
construction if we don't find it.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.358
So the stuff dates back to 1988.

31:00.441 --> 31:03.736
The files were digitized in 2000.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.780
So...

31:09.784 --> 31:10.869
Whoa.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.413
Yeah. I don't blame you if you wanna run.

31:14.455 --> 31:16.875
Nope. Let's get to it.

31:16.958 --> 31:17.959
All right.

31:18.626 --> 31:19.460
I would blame you.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.129
[Connor] Yeah. I know you would.

31:21.796 --> 31:22.964
[Connor groans]

31:23.047 --> 31:24.632
I thought corporate law was boring,

31:24.716 --> 31:27.719
but going through 20 years
of construction contracts

31:27.802 --> 31:29.762
is positively mind-numbing.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.307
Hey, look at this.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.142
Did you find the deed?

31:34.225 --> 31:35.184
No.

31:35.810 --> 31:39.439
These are all projects
from when Dilpher was Dad's contractor.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.524
There's like 20 of them here.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.360
Wow.

31:44.944 --> 31:47.071
How could that man be so ungrateful?

31:47.155 --> 31:48.865
Takes all kinds to make a world.

31:48.948 --> 31:52.201
Look at the date. March 11, 1999.

31:52.785 --> 31:53.786
Your birthday.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.413
No, not just any birthday.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.916
My favorite birthday. The best birthday.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.042
Your seventh birthday.

31:59.125 --> 32:02.003
That was the year we finally got Dad
to take us to Disney World.

32:02.086 --> 32:05.381
Yeah. That was the best birthday ever.

32:06.132 --> 32:09.719
Although you did get carsick and threw up
all over Kevin's new sneakers.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.513
Yeah, best birthday ever.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.392
Abby.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.772
Look at this signature on here.
Dad couldn't have signed this.

32:20.855 --> 32:22.982
He was in Florida with us that day.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.027
This isn't a fax. This is the original.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.657
-So you're saying this is a forgery?
-Has to be.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.575
Dad was in Florida with us.

32:33.242 --> 32:34.327
So wait.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.537
Paul Dilpher forged Dad's signatures

32:36.621 --> 32:39.207
to authorize
the substandard concrete pours?

32:39.290 --> 32:40.249
He framed Dad.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.920
We can use this to disprove Dilpher's
claim that Dad was in on his scheme.

32:44.003 --> 32:45.296
We need more proof.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.465
I think I know where to find that.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.885
[upbeat music playing]

32:53.096 --> 32:55.223
-Not here. You?
-Mm...

32:56.057 --> 32:59.018
Yes. I think this might be
the Disney World album.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.188
Okay, we got, uh, Bree.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.233
Bree.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.276
Jess. Bree.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.444
Aw, you screaming.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.779
Aw, you pinching me.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.240
Well, that's what big sisters are for. Oh.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.244
Look at the date.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.039
[Connor] Yes! March 11, 1999.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.750
This proves Dad couldn't have signed
that contract.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.210
This could clear Dad's name.

33:24.293 --> 33:26.504
And if Dilpher forged that document,

33:26.587 --> 33:29.007
maybe he did it to other companies too.

33:29.090 --> 33:29.966
This is good.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.385
It's gonna take me some time
to put the evidence together.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.595
I'll take it
to the Attorney General myself.

33:34.679 --> 33:38.016
Otherwise my firm will use their muscle
and get Dilpher off and frame Dad.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.184
We're not gonna let that happen.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.152
[man] Hey, Luke.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.490
Mr. Sullivan.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.702
What brings you here?

33:57.785 --> 34:00.663
Well, as part of your parole,
your PO can show up unannounced.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.623
At your residence,

34:03.583 --> 34:05.418
or at your place of employment.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.046
But you know that.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.422
Yes, sir.

34:10.423 --> 34:11.966
What I meant to say was, uh...

34:12.967 --> 34:14.844
hey. Nice to see you.

34:16.262 --> 34:19.223
But I thought we were meeting on the 20th?

34:19.307 --> 34:21.059
Oh, we're still meeting on the 20th.

34:22.393 --> 34:26.898
Just wanted to come by in person.
See your new place of employment.

34:26.981 --> 34:27.815
I mean...

34:30.568 --> 34:32.737
this is your new place
of employment, right?

34:32.820 --> 34:33.654
Yes, sir.

34:33.738 --> 34:37.366
-So why didn't you tell me about this?
-I put it in my report.

34:37.450 --> 34:39.118
Why didn't you tell me before?

34:39.202 --> 34:41.954
You have to clear these things with me.
You know that.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.792
Yeah, it just all happened so fast.

34:46.375 --> 34:50.171
-Why did you leave your other employment?
-Got fired.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.422
How come?

34:53.216 --> 34:55.593
Well, Kwik Go found out about my record.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.846
-I think you told them.
-I did tell them.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.642
You were supposed to tell them,
before they hired you.

35:02.725 --> 35:05.561
Look, I tried that, sir.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.687
Several times.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.481
But no one would take a chance on me.

35:08.564 --> 35:11.776
And if I didn't get a job,
I'd have to go back.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.236
So you lied.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.196
I didn't lie.

35:16.697 --> 35:18.116
I just didn't tell them.

35:18.199 --> 35:22.578
If you don't tell them,
it's a violation of your parole.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.125
Jesus.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.086
[suspenseful music playing]

35:35.758 --> 35:37.009
We're gonna let this slide.

35:38.928 --> 35:39.929
For now.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.724
What about this new employer?
Did you tell him?

35:43.808 --> 35:45.810
I did.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.687
He's a stand-up kind of guy.

35:47.770 --> 35:48.604
Good.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.273
Good for you.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.360
This is a nice place.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.611
Yeah.

35:55.695 --> 35:56.946
Remember this.

35:57.029 --> 36:00.575
I can't keep giving you second chances
before I send you back

36:00.658 --> 36:02.785
to your buddies at the North Branch.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.246
-Understood, sir.
-See you on the 20th.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.372
Yeah.

36:11.627 --> 36:13.462
-[Mick] Watch out for the stump.
-Yeah.

36:13.546 --> 36:14.839
[Mick] Here we go.

36:14.922 --> 36:15.756
Okay.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.259
All right. It's just a couple more miles.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.052
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Okay.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.138
Oh, man. You two okay?

36:22.221 --> 36:24.140
-We're fine--
-Here, let us help.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.391
You know what? You can.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.310
Good idea. Thanks. Really appreciate it.

36:27.393 --> 36:29.562
Easy does it. You grab the bag.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.147
Don't tell me what to do.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.691
I got you.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.818
-Yeah, thanks.
-One under each arm. Good idea.

36:35.902 --> 36:36.736
Good.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.280
Here we go, nice and easy at first.
Take it easy. Here we go.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.240
-Oh. Oh.
-Oh?

36:41.324 --> 36:42.158
Oh, what?

36:42.783 --> 36:44.035
Let me see the photo.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.417
This is the boulder.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.629
Holy mackerel! Yeah. That's it!

36:55.129 --> 36:56.255
Hey, guys, listen,

36:56.339 --> 36:58.341
we're gonna go down there
and take a picture.

36:58.424 --> 37:00.509
I want you to take it
looking just like this,

37:00.593 --> 37:02.678
-just in these spots, okay?
-Wait.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.388
This is you two?

37:04.472 --> 37:05.973
No way!

37:06.057 --> 37:07.767
Don't be so shocked, bub.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.435
You're gonna get old too.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.145
Let's go. Take our picture.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.356
-Okay, let's go.
-Got you, all right?

37:18.611 --> 37:21.447
[boy] I hope we're still out here
when we're your age.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.158
-No, you don't.
-Say "snallygaster."

37:32.083 --> 37:34.168
"Early accounts of the snallygaster

37:34.252 --> 37:38.214
describe the monster called
the Schneller Geist,

37:38.297 --> 37:40.800
meaning 'quick ghost' in German."

37:41.801 --> 37:45.012
I can't believe that this many people
actually believe in this thing.

37:45.096 --> 37:49.475
No, it's not that they believe in it.
It's that they want to believe in it.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.436
Haven't you ever believed
in something magical?

37:52.520 --> 37:54.438
What, like a unicorn?

37:54.522 --> 37:55.773
Well, yes.

37:55.856 --> 37:59.318
See, a unicorn, I can understand,
because a unicorn's pretty.

37:59.402 --> 38:02.780
But why would anybody wanna believe
in a creepy monster like this?

38:02.863 --> 38:05.908
He's not creepy, he's otherworldly.

38:05.992 --> 38:10.705
He's proof that there's more to life
than what meets the eye.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.248
He's a magical creature.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.834
It's beautiful when you put it that way.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.128
Who looks like a freaky dragon

38:17.211 --> 38:19.964
that swoops out of the sky
and steals farm animals.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.340
See? Now you lost me.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.968
Come on. Have you never believed
in something you can't see?

38:24.051 --> 38:26.012
-The Easter Bunny?
-No.

38:26.095 --> 38:29.682
But I do make a delicious
German wine-braised rabbit stew.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.018
Well,

38:32.518 --> 38:34.603
I did believe in the tooth fairy.

38:34.687 --> 38:35.604
Big time.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.023
-That's sweet.
-Yeah.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.692
I still remember the excitement
of looking under my pillow

38:39.775 --> 38:41.777
and finding that hundred-dollar bill.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.780
Wow. Okay. We all got a quarter.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.366
My parents had a lot to make up for.

38:47.450 --> 38:51.704
Well, if that was the going rate,
I would have been yanking my teeth out.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.127
[upbeat music playing]

39:17.772 --> 39:19.023
Nice warm-up.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.275
That was the warm-up?

39:21.359 --> 39:23.152
We'll try a few more kicks.

39:23.235 --> 39:25.321
-Let's see what you got.
-Okay.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.994
[Jess] David, I know you think
this is all pretty goofy,

39:32.078 --> 39:33.913
but I appreciate you doing it.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.332
Look at how much fun everyone's having.

39:36.832 --> 39:40.086
Even if the snallygaster isn't real,
it doesn't matter.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.213
No, it doesn't.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.090
Because I love you.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.718
Do you love me enough

39:47.802 --> 39:50.721
to make one big wedding cake
instead of cupcakes?

39:50.805 --> 39:51.806
Ooh...

39:52.640 --> 39:53.933
I think so.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.352
Why can't we just have both?

39:56.894 --> 39:59.397
-You're wonderful.
-You're wonderful.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.234
Keep your eyes peeled.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.986
The snallygaster could be anywhere.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.780
They prefer to nest here

40:07.863 --> 40:10.616
in the pristine pines
of the Maryland shores.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.911
-[screeching]
-Shh! Did you hear that?

40:16.789 --> 40:18.958
-[owl screeches]
-[shrieks]

40:22.670 --> 40:23.879
It's just an owl.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.048
It's an owl. Saw that.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.635
[in quiet voice]
I saw the snallygaster as a child.

40:30.302 --> 40:31.137
What?

40:32.304 --> 40:33.305
[in normal voice] Nothing.

40:36.725 --> 40:37.852
For the love--

40:38.727 --> 40:39.812
What happened?

40:39.895 --> 40:43.691
Well, there was this
really big, mean, nasty bear--

40:43.774 --> 40:45.443
Don't you even--

40:45.526 --> 40:48.237
I took a little spill down a ravine.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.989
Actually, I took a little spill too.

40:50.072 --> 40:51.782
But the good news is...

40:54.827 --> 40:56.162
Ta-da!

40:56.245 --> 40:57.079
We did it!

40:57.663 --> 41:00.040
And they said you can't go home again.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.834
We proved them wrong, Tommy.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.753
-I don't think that's the same boulder.
-Sure it is.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.714
-I didn't think so either.
-You did.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.215
-No, I didn't.
-You did.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.135
I said I did, but I didn't mean it.

41:11.218 --> 41:12.720
You fell off a cliff--

41:12.803 --> 41:15.181
Yeah, I didn't want
to shatter your fragile illusion.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.308
[Mick] So you shattered your leg.
I don't understand.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.726
It's the same boulder.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.519
It's the same boulder.

41:22.021 --> 41:25.024
[theme music playing]

-[narrator] Next on Chesapeake Shores:
-We have proof

44:07.186 --> 44:09.647
-Dilpher forged your signature.
-What?

44:09.730 --> 44:11.649
Kevin and Sarah are trying to have a baby.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.025
-Nice.
-You have news?

44:13.108 --> 44:16.403
-No. It's just a checkup.
-[Driscoll] What's wrong with you?

44:16.487 --> 44:17.321
Take a hint!

44:17.404 --> 44:19.114
[Megan]
I brought someone you might remember.

44:19.198 --> 44:20.449
Come on, it's you and me.

44:20.532 --> 44:22.868

Point-three milliliters epinephrine. Whoa!

44:22.951 --> 44:24.953
Point-three milliliters, not 0.6.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.331
-[Jess] What if I don't want kids?
-You don't?

44:27.414 --> 44:28.749
Would you still wanna marry me?
