in front of the fire?

07:31.368 --> 07:34.704
Dad, I always get my

07:31.368 --> 07:34.704
guitar lesson from Uncle Jesse.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.082
Are you sure

07:34.746 --> 07:37.082
you want to do this?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.209
Honey, this is gonna

07:37.124 --> 07:39.209
be a lot of fun.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.544
I'm going to teach you

07:39.251 --> 07:41.544
a great song. Come here.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
Okay, now, you watch

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
what I do real carefully

07:43.713 --> 07:45.924
and then you do it.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.803
♪ Froggie went a-courtin'

07:45.966 --> 07:49.803
and he did ride uh-huh ♪

07:49.844 --> 07:52.931

07:52.973 --> 07:54.266
♪ Well froggie went a-- ♪

07:54.308 --> 07:56.268
Dad! Dad, stop.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.647
Here's where I am.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.656
Maybe froggie's not quite ready

08:06.903 --> 08:09.656
to go a-courtin' yet.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.368
Let's work on that "D" chord.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.368
Come on.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.162
Sit right down here.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.330
Now take these two fingers and

08:16.371 --> 08:17.580
put them on the second fret.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.460
No, the second fret.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.544
No, the second fret.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.255
No, the second fret.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.423
- No, the second--

08:25.297 --> 08:26.423
- Dad.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.925
You're making me nervous.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.302
How can I make you nervous?

08:30.344 --> 08:31.886
I'm your father.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.265
Because whenever you try

08:31.928 --> 08:35.265
to teach me things, we argue.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.058
- No, we don't.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.058
- Yes, we do.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.059
No, we don't.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.769
- Yes, we do.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.769
- No, we don't!

08:41.271 --> 08:42.314
What am I doing?

08:42.356 --> 08:44.065
You're arguing

08:42.356 --> 08:44.065
with me.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.359
I'm not arguing

08:44.107 --> 08:45.359
with you.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.734
You're arguing

08:45.400 --> 08:46.734
with me.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.904
Now, we're here

08:47.819 --> 08:49.904
to have fun.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.781
Well, I'm not having fun.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.075
I'd have fun

08:51.823 --> 08:54.075
if Uncle Jesse was here.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.996
That's what this

08:56.577 --> 08:57.996
is all about, isn't it?

09:00.290 --> 09:03.460
All of Uncle Jesse's

09:00.290 --> 09:03.460
clothes are gone.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.338
Is Uncle Jesse thinking

09:03.502 --> 09:06.338
about moving out?

09:07.714 --> 09:09.799
The truth?

09:11.176 --> 09:12.344
Yes.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.180
I hate this.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.433
When mom died,

09:17.140 --> 09:18.433
I never thought

09:18.475 --> 09:20.977
I'd like living

09:18.475 --> 09:20.977
in this house again.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.729
Then Uncle Jesse

09:21.019 --> 09:22.729
and Joey moved in

09:22.770 --> 09:24.981
and things got better.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.526
I don't want anything

09:25.023 --> 09:27.526
to change.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.776
Aw, honey.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.737
I want him to stay

09:28.818 --> 09:30.737
as much as you do.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.240
Then why don't you

09:30.778 --> 09:33.240
get him back?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.824
Because he's an adult.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.576
You can't just go

09:34.866 --> 09:36.576
pick him up and

09:36.617 --> 09:38.537
put him under your arm

09:36.617 --> 09:38.537
and bring him back home.

09:39.954 --> 09:43.166
Right now he's struggling

09:39.954 --> 09:43.166
with some things.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.292
When..

09:44.334 --> 09:46.753
...and if

09:44.334 --> 09:46.753
the time is right..

09:46.794 --> 09:49.256
...he'll be back.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.383
Okay?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.760
Well, it's not okay.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.053
But okay.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.807
Come on.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.807
Let's finish the guitar lesson.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.351
What else

09:59.849 --> 10:01.351
did Uncle Jesse do?

10:01.393 --> 10:03.895
Well, he usually teaches me

10:01.393 --> 10:03.895
an Elvis song.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.566
I know a great one.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.901
♪ Are you lonesome tonight ♪

10:09.943 --> 10:11.528
♪ Do you miss me tonight ♪

10:11.570 --> 10:15.407
♪ Are you sorry

10:11.570 --> 10:15.407

10:15.449 --> 10:17.158
♪ Is your heart

♪ Did he come

10:22.247 --> 10:24.499
Thanks for helping me

10:22.247 --> 10:24.499
move in, Michelle.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.709
Why don't you just put that

10:24.541 --> 10:26.709
stuff right over there?

10:29.087 --> 10:30.671
'Thank you.'

10:30.713 --> 10:34.134
You know, Michelle,

10:30.713 --> 10:34.134
I grew up in this room.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.471
Boy, this place

10:34.175 --> 10:37.471
brings back memories.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.976
Here, Steph, you forgot

10:40.390 --> 10:42.976
the rest of your zoo.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.769
Thanks, D.J.,

10:43.017 --> 10:44.769
Isn't it neat

10:44.811 --> 10:47.355
we each have our own room

10:44.811 --> 10:47.355
for a couple of days?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.941
Might be more than

10:47.397 --> 10:49.941
a couple of days.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.610
What are you

10:49.983 --> 10:51.610
talking about?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.694
Oh, nothing.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.780
What is going on?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.700
Uh, Steph..

10:59.742 --> 11:01.286
Who do you think's

10:59.742 --> 11:01.286
a better singer?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.121
Alvin or Theodore?

11:03.163 --> 11:04.581
Are you serious?

11:04.623 --> 11:07.208
Everybody knows

11:04.623 --> 11:07.208
without Alvin

11:07.250 --> 11:08.709
they're just

11:07.250 --> 11:08.709
a bunch of squirrels

11:08.751 --> 11:11.129
dressed like Don Johnson.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.089
You're right.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.257
See you.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.634
Freeze.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.179
What is going on?

11:19.220 --> 11:20.388
Alright, Steph.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.057
Sit down.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.059
You should hear this, too,

11:23.099 --> 11:25.059
Michelle.

11:31.566 --> 11:34.819
Uncle Jesse didn't

11:31.566 --> 11:34.819
just go on a vacation.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.072
He's thinking

11:34.861 --> 11:38.072
about moving out.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.907
Can't daddy

11:38.114 --> 11:39.907
get him back?

11:39.949 --> 11:42.369
Dad said there's

11:39.949 --> 11:42.369
nothing he can do.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.996
Then we got

11:42.410 --> 11:44.996
to do something.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.289
You're right, Steph.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.250
What if Uncle Jesse

11:46.331 --> 11:49.250
never comes back?

11:49.876 --> 11:52.253
Daddy.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.383
Okay. Here's the plan.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.468
- I'll call Uncle Jesse.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.468
- Check.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.595
Then I'll tell him

11:58.510 --> 12:00.595
Michelle's really sick.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.347
And he'll come rushing back.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.682
Then what?

12:03.722 --> 12:05.058
Well, then you throw

12:03.722 --> 12:05.058
your arms around him

12:05.099 --> 12:06.351
and beg him to stay while

12:06.393 --> 12:08.019
I let the air out of his tires.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.271
Wow!

12:10.313 --> 12:12.482
Uh, I need to speak

12:10.313 --> 12:12.482
to Jesse Cochran.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.484
This is his niece

12:12.524 --> 12:14.484
D.J. Tanner.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.110
Jesse's still out skiing.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.239
Uh, could you hold

12:16.152 --> 12:19.239
the line for one brief moment?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.157
He's not there.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.157
What are we gonna do we do?

12:21.199 --> 12:22.992
I don't know!

12:21.199 --> 12:22.992
Let me think.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.994
Okay! I got it!

12:26.871 --> 12:30.333
This is Stephanie Tanner,

12:26.871 --> 12:30.333
Uncle Jesse's other niece.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.794
Now listen very carefully.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.380
Help!

12:37.173 --> 12:40.510
Tell Uncle Jesse the baby's sick

12:37.173 --> 12:40.510
and she's coughing real bad.

12:40.552 --> 12:41.553
Here, listen.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.596
- Cough! Cough!

12:41.595 --> 12:42.596
- Cough!

12:42.637 --> 12:44.889
[coughing]

12:44.931 --> 12:46.765
Ahh.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.396
Ahh.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.152
[coughing]

12:58.194 --> 13:00.447
See?

12:58.194 --> 13:00.447
The baby's coughing really loud.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.989
Now Uncle Jesse's the only one

13:02.031 --> 13:04.492
who can get her to take her

13:02.031 --> 13:04.492
cough medicine.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.370
Promise me you'll tell him.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.370
Thanks.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.334
I lied.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.334
I hate to lie.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.505
But it was for

13:15.420 --> 13:17.505
a good cause.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.006
I guess.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.384
But if you could cough

13:19.048 --> 13:21.384
a few times

13:21.426 --> 13:22.843
I'd feel a lot better about

13:22.885 --> 13:25.221
this whole

13:22.885 --> 13:25.221
dirty business.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.224

I got to call home.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.767
Jesse, what's wrong?

16:15.809 --> 16:17.017
The kid is sick.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.812
I'm her uncle.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.812
She looks exactly like me.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.984
Damn, it's busy.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.402
I'm sorry guys, but see,

16:25.025 --> 16:26.402
I'm the only one

16:26.444 --> 16:27.821
who can give her

16:26.444 --> 16:27.821
her cough medicine.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.573
And-and I'm the best

16:27.862 --> 16:30.573
at singing her to sleep.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.825
Sorry, fellas.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.825
I got to split.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.118
- Oh.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.118
- Come on.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.036
Michelle needs me.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.373
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.583
But you knew

16:39.415 --> 16:40.583
when we got involved

16:40.625 --> 16:42.251
there were

16:40.625 --> 16:42.251
other women in my life.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.548
- Hey...yes!

16:44.295 --> 16:47.548
- Okay.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.216
Okay.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.677
Here's the shot.

16:50.718 --> 16:51.886
I'm gonna jump over the couch

16:51.928 --> 16:54.096
spin around three times

16:54.138 --> 16:55.515
drive to the hoop

16:55.556 --> 16:57.141
double pump twice

16:57.183 --> 16:58.434
finishing off

16:58.476 --> 16:59.978
with a reverse tomahawk

17:00.019 --> 17:01.270
monster jam.

17:03.773 --> 17:07.109
Is this before or after

17:03.773 --> 17:07.109
you spin straw into gold?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.863
Oh, yeah?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.863
Watch this!

17:16.577 --> 17:18.454
Yeah, I'd like to see

17:16.577 --> 17:18.454
Michael Jordan

17:18.496 --> 17:20.790
sink a shot like that

17:18.496 --> 17:20.790
with a couch on the court.

17:24.043 --> 17:24.961
How is she?

17:25.003 --> 17:26.212
- Jesse!

17:25.003 --> 17:26.212
- Hey, buddy.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.588
Where's Michelle?

17:27.630 --> 17:29.089
Do I need to give her

17:27.630 --> 17:29.089
her cough medicine?

17:29.131 --> 17:31.133
What are you

17:29.131 --> 17:31.133
talking about?

17:31.175 --> 17:32.886
What do you mean

17:31.175 --> 17:32.886
what am I talking about?

17:32.927 --> 17:35.346
Somebody called and said

17:32.927 --> 17:35.346
Michelle was very very sick.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.764
Michelle's fine.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.099
She's fine?

17:39.141 --> 17:41.811
[sighs]

17:39.141 --> 17:41.811
Thank God.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.438
What do you mean,

17:41.853 --> 17:44.438
she's fine?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.315
Do you realize

17:44.480 --> 17:46.315
I've been driving for four hours

17:46.357 --> 17:48.693
from lake Tahoe on my motorcycle

17:46.357 --> 17:48.693
in the freezing cold

17:48.735 --> 17:49.903
behind a cattle truck?

17:51.863 --> 17:53.865
Well, I've got to tell you,

17:51.863 --> 17:53.865
you made excellent time.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.368
Alright.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.746
Which one of you called?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.163
Must have been the girls.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.331
I think you really shook 'em up

18:02.373 --> 18:03.624
the way you took off

18:02.373 --> 18:03.624
like you did.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.459
No, I'm sorry.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.459
I didn't mean that.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.878
But it was something

18:05.501 --> 18:06.878
I had to do.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.797
Jesse, hang on.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.797
Talk to us.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.591
Yeah, maybe we can help you.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.260
Look, guys...ever since

18:11.632 --> 18:14.260
I've been out of high school

18:14.301 --> 18:16.303
I've done what I wanted,

18:14.301 --> 18:16.303
whenever I wanted

18:16.345 --> 18:18.097
with whoever I wanted.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.473
I've had no one to answer to

18:19.515 --> 18:21.893
nobody to worry about

18:19.515 --> 18:21.893
but myself, me.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.437
So I took off

18:22.977 --> 18:24.437
to find that guy.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.064
And you know what?

18:24.478 --> 18:26.064
I found him.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.024
I was having a great time,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.024
hanging with my buddies

18:28.066 --> 18:29.275
playing music.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.735
Then I get this call.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.487
Michelle is sick.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.487
Bam! Just like that.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.531
I come running back right into

18:33.529 --> 18:35.531
Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.620
I'm sorry, guys.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.121
I don't think it's

18:40.661 --> 18:42.121
where I want to be.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.625
Jesse, wait!

18:46.918 --> 18:48.753
You're going

18:46.918 --> 18:48.753
about this all wrong.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.005
I mean, maybe, when you moved in

18:48.795 --> 18:51.005
here you lost something.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.715
- Look how much you've gained.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.715
- What, Joseph?

18:52.757 --> 18:53.841
What have I gained?

18:53.883 --> 18:55.760
I'll give you

18:53.883 --> 18:55.760
a perfect example.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.177
Why do you think

18:55.802 --> 18:57.177
you came rushing back here

18:57.219 --> 18:58.972
to check on a cough?

18:59.013 --> 19:00.598
Because I care

18:59.013 --> 19:00.598
about Michelle.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.309
But I cared about Michelle

19:00.640 --> 19:03.309
before I moved into this house.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.269
Yeah, but before you moved

19:03.350 --> 19:05.269
into this house

19:05.311 --> 19:07.480
the girls were

19:05.311 --> 19:07.480
just your nieces.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.189
You stopped by

19:07.521 --> 19:09.189
four times a year to give them

19:09.231 --> 19:11.025
birthday and Christmas presents.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.569
(Danny)

19:11.067 --> 19:13.569
'It's not like that

19:11.067 --> 19:13.569
anymore, is it?'

19:13.611 --> 19:16.739
You have any idea how important

19:13.611 --> 19:16.739
you are to those three girls?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.866
Jesse, you have been

19:16.781 --> 19:18.866
there every time

19:18.908 --> 19:20.743
those girls

19:18.908 --> 19:20.743
have needed you.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.411
Can you honestly tell me

19:22.453 --> 19:25.081
that you can just forget

19:22.453 --> 19:25.081
about the past seven months?

19:25.123 --> 19:26.666
Just walk out

19:25.123 --> 19:26.666
of this house and..

19:26.707 --> 19:29.043
...go back to visits

19:26.707 --> 19:29.043
on birthdays and Christmas?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.385
They do love me,

19:36.300 --> 19:38.385
don't they?

19:40.304 --> 19:42.932
They really love me,

19:40.304 --> 19:42.932
don't they?

19:42.974 --> 19:44.976
Ha ha ha.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.895
Well, fellas,

19:45.018 --> 19:47.895
can you blame them?

19:47.937 --> 19:49.897
Feels pretty good,

19:47.937 --> 19:49.897
doesn't it?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.524
I'm going to tell

19:49.939 --> 19:51.524
you guys something..

19:51.565 --> 19:53.233
...but you better not

19:51.565 --> 19:53.233
tell any of my friends

19:53.275 --> 19:54.735
I said this.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.533
I think I'm realizing that..

20:00.574 --> 20:03.285
...being part

20:00.574 --> 20:03.285
of this family is..

20:03.327 --> 20:06.580
...filling a...empty..

20:06.622 --> 20:09.000
...an empty space

20:06.622 --> 20:09.000
in my heart..

20:09.042 --> 20:10.668
...that I didn't even know

20:09.042 --> 20:10.668
was there.

20:16.590 --> 20:20.553
Jesse, we can make this

20:16.590 --> 20:20.553
easier for you.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.013
You can take time

20:20.594 --> 20:22.013
for yourself

20:22.055 --> 20:23.597
whenever you need it.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.599
Yeah, don't wait till

20:23.639 --> 20:25.599
it builds up inside

20:25.641 --> 20:28.019
then you gotta run away

20:25.641 --> 20:28.019
from home again.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.813
If you need to take off

20:28.061 --> 20:30.813
for a few days, fine.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.023
We'll cover for you.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.274
Yeah,

20:32.065 --> 20:34.274
we'll-we'll make this work.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.651
Will you stay out

20:34.316 --> 20:35.651
of my room?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.614
I'll try.

20:40.656 --> 20:44.202
So, Lassie's

20:40.656 --> 20:44.202
coming home?

20:45.786 --> 20:48.873
Yeah, yeah,

20:45.786 --> 20:48.873
Lassie's coming home.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.211
I got to hug somebody.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.838
Me, too.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.173
Go nuts.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.514
Hey, watch it.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.308
Sorry, kid.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.560
Uncle Jesse!

21:09.602 --> 21:11.145
You're back, you're back.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.688
You're back, you're back.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.314
You're back!

21:14.356 --> 21:15.649
D.J., get in here, quick!

21:15.691 --> 21:17.110
Uncle Jesse's back!

21:17.151 --> 21:19.153
Our plan worked!

21:19.195 --> 21:20.821
Uncle Jesse!

21:19.195 --> 21:20.821
You're back!

21:20.863 --> 21:22.907
Hey!

21:22.949 --> 21:25.284
Well, I was

21:22.949 --> 21:25.284
in the neighborhood, you know..

21:25.325 --> 21:27.536
Are you here to stay?

21:27.578 --> 21:29.997
Or pick up your stuff

21:27.578 --> 21:29.997
and leave again?

21:31.749 --> 21:33.793
Come here, girls. Sit down.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.378
Come here, D.J.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.632
I came back because

21:36.420 --> 21:39.632
I was worried about Michelle..

21:39.673 --> 21:42.509
...and because

21:39.673 --> 21:42.509
I missed you two guys.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.595
And no,

21:42.551 --> 21:44.595
I'm not going anywhere.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.472
Does this mean you'll

21:44.637 --> 21:46.472
never leave again?

21:47.890 --> 21:50.101
I can't promise you

21:47.890 --> 21:50.101
I'm gonna live here forever.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.938
But what I can promise is..

21:53.980 --> 21:57.357
...I'm always going to be

21:53.980 --> 21:57.357
your uncle.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.610
And I'm always going to be there

21:57.399 --> 21:59.610
when you two need me.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.156
And I'm always gonna love

22:01.154 --> 22:03.156
you two knuckleheads

22:03.197 --> 22:04.531
very, very much.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.452
Cross your heart

22:06.533 --> 22:08.452
and hope to die?

22:08.494 --> 22:10.037
Pinkie swear!

22:10.079 --> 22:13.332
Oh! He does mean business!

22:20.131 --> 22:22.300
You're up.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.760
Here.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.263
I drove four hours

22:24.802 --> 22:27.263
in the freezing cold

22:27.305 --> 22:29.098
on my motorcycle

22:27.305 --> 22:29.098
behind a cattle truck

22:29.140 --> 22:30.141
to give you this.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.440
Michelle, can I talk

22:35.771 --> 22:38.440
to you a second?

22:40.776 --> 22:42.402
You know,

22:40.776 --> 22:42.402
when I first came here

22:42.444 --> 22:43.946
I thought I was just gonna

22:43.988 --> 22:45.281
move in for a few months

22:43.988 --> 22:45.281
you know

22:45.323 --> 22:46.782

22:46.824 --> 22:49.118
...get on

22:46.824 --> 22:49.118
with my life, but..

22:49.160 --> 22:51.411
...you know what?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.579
This is my life.

This is where

22:54.456 --> 22:56.334
I'm supposed to be right now.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.423
Do you realize, young lady,

22:59.879 --> 23:03.423
what you put me through tonight?

23:03.465 --> 23:07.053
I was with the most

23:03.465 --> 23:07.053
incredible woman in the world.

23:07.094 --> 23:10.764
Over two years old,

23:07.094 --> 23:10.764
that is. Sorry.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.350
Anyway..

23:12.390 --> 23:15.435
...from the moment

23:12.390 --> 23:15.435
I heard you were sick..

23:15.477 --> 23:17.813
...all I could do

23:15.477 --> 23:17.813
was think of this face.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.608
What is it

23:19.565 --> 23:21.608

Goodnight, kid.

'Da.'

23:41.295 --> 23:43.214
Can I get a kiss?

23:52.181 --> 23:53.766

23:52.181 --> 23:53.766
