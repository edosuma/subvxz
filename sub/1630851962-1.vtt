- I'm gonna go
get some anyways.

20:51.517 --> 20:54.418
<i> - We have formed that</i>
<i> connection with each other.</i>

20:54.420 --> 20:56.621
- It's a tropical cake.
I made it myself.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.056

20:59.058 --> 21:04.728
We're in that dispatch room
for 12 long hours together.

21:04.730 --> 21:08.299
- Dispatchers, if you leave
something on a table somewhere,

21:08.301 --> 21:10.367
We're gonna eat it.
[laughter]

21:10.369 --> 21:11.902
<i> There's definitely a night</i>
<i> you look at the clock</i>

21:11.904 --> 21:13.672
And you're like, "I don't know
if I can do this."

21:13.674 --> 21:15.173
- Can I smash the cake on you?

21:15.175 --> 21:17.041
[laughter]

21:17.043 --> 21:20.177
You gotta pull on your big
girl pants and keep on moving.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.846
<i> - You have to be able to trust</i>

21:21.848 --> 21:24.181
<i> The people</i>
<i> that you're sitting next to.</i>

21:24.183 --> 21:25.716
<i> You have to have</i>
<i> each other's back.</i>

21:25.718 --> 21:27.185
- Whoa!
[laughter]

21:27.187 --> 21:29.687
<i> - 'cause you can't</i>
<i> do it alone,</i>

21:29.689 --> 21:31.922
And you never know what
you're gonna have to deal with.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.590
[phone rings]

21:33.592 --> 21:36.127
- 911, what is the address
of your emergency?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.395
<i> - (bleep).</i>
- What's going on?

21:38.397 --> 21:40.931
<i> - My son was in the</i>
<i> living room watching tv.</i>

21:40.933 --> 21:44.335
<i> He's not there. [indistinct]!</i>

21:44.337 --> 21:46.737

of your son.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.238
<i> - He has brown eyes.</i>

21:48.240 --> 21:51.876
<i> He's small.</i>
<i> He's maybe 35, 38 pounds.</i>

21:51.878 --> 21:53.544
- Dispatch to bedford units.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.279
Female stated
she was in the bathroom.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.614
When she came out,

21:56.616 --> 21:59.484
Her son, five years old,
was missing from the home.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.785
<i> - [indistinct]!</i>
