each other, and whatnot.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.285
No, I mean now.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.645
You could be an axe murderer.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.683
There's always that possibility.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.088
Come on, Hazel Grace.
Take a risk.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.287
I don't...

11:52.680 --> 11:53.681
Really?

11:53.800 --> 11:54.961
That is disgusting.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.521
What?

11:56.600 --> 11:58.967
What, do you think that
that's cool or something?

11:59.120 --> 12:00.400
You just ruined
this whole thing.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.130
The whole thing?
Yes, this whole thing!

12:02.320 --> 12:03.606
Oh, man.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.803
Ugh. And you were
doing really well, too.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.965
God! There's always
a hamartia, isn't there?

12:09.160 --> 12:11.322
And yours is even though
you had freaking cancer...

12:11.480 --> 12:13.360
you're willing to give
money to a corporation...

12:13.384 --> 12:15.591
for the chance to acquire
even more cancer?

12:15.960 --> 12:18.645
Let me just tell you that not
being able to breathe sucks!

12:18.840 --> 12:20.330
It totally sucks.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.641
"Hamartia"?

12:22.840 --> 12:24.365
It's a fatal flaw.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.045
Ah, a fatal...

12:26.320 --> 12:27.321
Hazel Grace,

12:27.400 --> 12:29.400
they don't actually hurt
you unless you light them.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.201
Hmm?

12:31.640 --> 12:33.130
I've never lit one.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.166
It's a metaphor, see?

12:35.320 --> 12:38.483
You put the thing that does the
killing right between your teeth...

12:39.880 --> 12:42.121
but you never give it
the power to kill you.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.486
A metaphor.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.410
(CAR APPROACHING)

12:49.400 --> 12:52.051

Is it Top <i>Model</i> time?

12:54.640 --> 12:56.324
No. Uh...

12:56.520 --> 12:58.170

13:06.504 --> 13:07.646
Ooh!

13:07.880 --> 13:09.769
Yeah, I failed my test
a couple times.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.326
You don't say.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.200
Actually, the fourth time
I took the test,

13:13.224 --> 13:14.714
it was going about
how this is going.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.844
And when it was over...

13:17.000 --> 13:19.207
the instructor looks over
at me, and she says...

13:19.400 --> 13:22.768
"Your driving, while unpleasant,
is not technically unsafe."

13:23.080 --> 13:24.081
Cancer perk.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.889
Total cancer perk.
(LAUGHS)

13:27.560 --> 13:29.722
So, tell me about you.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.891
Um, I was 13 when they found it.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.248

14:38.680 --> 14:40.125
So, they called it
"The Miracle."

14:40.280 --> 14:42.160
Of course, my lungs still
suck at being lungs...

14:42.310 --> 14:44.711
but, theoretically, they could
continue to suck like this...

14:44.870 --> 14:46.961

14:47.480 --> 14:48.970

17:25.480 --> 17:27.960

17:28.119 --> 17:30.646

zombies or Stormtroopers.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.131

17:35.120 --> 17:36.804
...you will read this.

You're quoting my book.

22:14.760 --> 22:18.526
She said she wanted to break up
with me before the surgery...

22:18.680 --> 22:20.921
because she couldn't handle it.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.721
I'm about to lose my eyesight,
and she can't handle it.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.401
I kept saying "always" to her.
Like, "Always."

22:27.560 --> 22:29.927
And she kept talking over me

22:30.000 --> 22:32.002
and not saying it back, and...

22:32.760 --> 22:36.287
It was like I was gone
already, you know?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.726
HAZEL: You know,
sometimes...

22:37.880 --> 22:40.042
people don't understand
the promises

22:40.120 --> 22:42.248

ISAAC: I know, but...

22:44.400 --> 22:46.050
I feel like such a loser.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.281
I still have her necklace on.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.566
Take it off.

22:48.760 --> 22:49.966
Dude, take that off.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.610
Yeah.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.205
Here we go, man.
Here we go.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.123
(GRUNTS) I just want
to kick something.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.730
Don't hit that, don't hit that.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.241
Uh...

23:03.280 --> 23:04.805
Hit this.
Sorry.

I've been wanting to call
you for a few days now...

23:14.560 --> 23:16.120
but I've been waiting
until I could form

23:16.160 --> 23:18.040
a coherent thought about
An Imperial Affliction.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.769
The trophy?
Yeah.

23:32.840 --> 23:33.841
Are you sure?

23:33.920 --> 23:36.760
I've been looking for a way to tell
my father I kind of hate basketball.

(ISAAC YELLING)

23:51.000 --> 23:52.525
Yes, I did.
But the ending.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.205
I know.
It is rather abrupt.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.601
"Rather abrupt"? Are you kidding?
It's evil!

23:56.760 --> 23:58.649
I mean, I understand
that she dies...

23:59.120 --> 24:01.280
but there's an unwritten
contract between author and...

24:01.640 --> 24:02.687
Gus?
Yeah?

24:02.840 --> 24:03.841
Cool?
Sure.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.490
Between author and reader.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.449
And I feel like ending your book
in the middle of a sentence...

24:07.520 --> 24:09.363
violates that contract,
don't you think?

24:09.520 --> 24:10.601
Okay, yes.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.727
I know what you mean...

24:12.120 --> 24:13.610
but, to be completely honest,

24:13.720 --> 24:14.920
I think it's just so truthful.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.289
You just die in
the middle of life.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.840
You die in the middle

24:24.280 --> 24:26.487
what happens to everyone
after Anna dies.

24:27.880 --> 24:28.881
Like Anna's mother.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.405
Yes, and the Dutch Tulip Man.

so many letters,

24:39.760 --> 24:41.250

(SIGHS)

32:44.680 --> 32:45.761
So, uh...

32:46.160 --> 32:48.731
you're a survivor yourself, huh?

32:48.800 --> 32:49.801
Yeah.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.803
I didn't cut this fellow
off for the hell of it.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.081
(GUS CHUCKLES)

32:54.080 --> 32:57.050

excellent weight-loss strategy.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.765

How's your health now?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.321
It's great.
NEC for 14 months.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.447
Really?
Yeah.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.010
That's fantastic.
Yeah.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.164
I'm very lucky.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.841
Hey, listen, Gus.

33:20.040 --> 33:23.965
You have to understand,
Hazel's still pretty sick.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.765
And she will be
the rest of her life.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.520
And she's gonna want to
keep up with you.

33:29.709 --> 33:31.869
She's that kind of girl. But
the truth is, her lungs...

33:31.893 --> 33:32.893
Ready, Gus?

33:33.560 --> 33:34.561
Yeah.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.570
All right.
See you soon.

33:39.720 --> 33:40.960
All right.

33:43.840 --> 33:44.887
Oh!

33:45.400 --> 33:47.243
Such a beautiful day.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.361
Yeah.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.761
Is this where you take all
of your romantic conquests?

33:50.960 --> 33:52.450
Every last one of them.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.121
That's probably why
I'm still a virgin.

33:55.960 --> 33:56.961
(CHUCKLES)

33:57.040 --> 33:59.202
You are not still a virgin.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.081
Are you really?

34:02.240 --> 34:03.571
Let me show you something.

34:03.640 --> 34:04.641
(CHUCKLES)

34:08.239 --> 34:09.650
See this circle?

34:13.800 --> 34:15.404
That is a circle of virgins.

34:15.639 --> 34:16.641
Uh-huh.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.811
And this...

34:23.120 --> 34:25.121
is 18-year-old dudes
with one leg.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.524
Oh...
So, yeah.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.850
<i>Funky Bones by
Jeep Van Lieshout.</i>

34:40.840 --> 34:41.966
He sounds quite Dutch.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.201
And he is.

34:43.360 --> 34:45.123
Much like Rik Smits.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.009
And tulips.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.001
Sandwich?

34:50.400 --> 34:51.400
Let me guess.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.608
Dutch cheese and tomato.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.083
Sorry, the tomatoes are Mexican.
(LAUGHS)

34:56.719 --> 34:58.290
How dare you!

35:00.000 --> 35:01.001
Hmm.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.162
How cool is this?

35:03.320 --> 35:05.687
They're using a skeleton
as a playground.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.410
Think about that.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.725
You do love your symbols.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.760
Speaking of which,
you're probably wondering...

35:12.920 --> 35:15.080
why you're sitting here eating
a bad cheese sandwich...

35:15.120 --> 35:17.440
and drinking orange juice with
a guy in a Rik Smits jersey.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.528
It actually has crossed my mind.
(CHUCKLES)

35:19.960 --> 35:22.281
Well, Hazel Grace,
like so many before you...

35:22.440 --> 35:25.489
and listen, I say this with
the utmost of affection...

35:26.280 --> 35:27.725
you used your wish moronically.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.809
Okay, we've been through this.
I was 13.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.770
Hush! lam in the midst
of a grand soliloquy, here.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.003
You were young,
impressionable...

35:35.160 --> 35:37.040
the Grim Reaper staring
you right in the face...

35:37.280 --> 35:40.090
and it led you to rush into making
a wish you didn't really want.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.970
But, how could
little Hazel Grace,

35:42.040 --> 35:43.720
having never read
An Imperial Affliction...

35:43.744 --> 35:47.082
know that her one true wish was
to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten...

35:47.240 --> 35:49.083
in his Amsterdam exile.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.721
But I didn't save it, so...

35:54.040 --> 35:56.361
It's a good thing I saved mine.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.770
So, you're saying...

36:00.920 --> 36:03.207
I'm not gonna give you my
wish or anything, Hazel.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.885
If that's what you're thinking.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.041
However...

36:06.800 --> 36:11.408
I, too, have an interest in meeting
this Mr. Peter Van Houten...

36:12.600 --> 36:13.931
and I don't really think
it would make much sense...

36:14.080 --> 36:15.161
to meet him without the
girl who introduced me

36:15.240 --> 36:16.520
to the book
in the first place...

36:16.544 --> 36:17.601
now, would it?

36:17.920 --> 36:20.400
So I talked to the Genies,
and they're all for it.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.450
We leave in a month.

36:23.960 --> 36:24.961
No.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.486
Mmm-hmm.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.367
(WHISPERING) Oh, my God.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.965
Oh, my God!

36:32.120 --> 36:33.565

36:34.240 --> 36:35.969
Thank you!

36:37.560 --> 36:39.961
Apparently, they... I don't know
if they do this that often,

36:40.240 --> 36:43.801
but they're willing to
bring me, too, and...

36:44.160 --> 36:45.730
That's incredible.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.405
Hazel, that's so beautiful.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.721
I know.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.524
And a little insane.

36:50.680 --> 36:53.286
Oh, it's super insane. It's...
It's... It's... It's crazy!

36:53.440 --> 36:54.487
Well...
It's Amsterdam!

36:54.640 --> 36:55.846
He just met you...

36:55.960 --> 36:58.201
I know! ...and he's
giving you his wish.

36:58.320 --> 37:02.405
Well, we're sharing the wish. We're... I
mean, he... He... Yeah. We're sharing it.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.131
That's sweet.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.731
Unless...

37:06.960 --> 37:08.200
What?

37:08.800 --> 37:10.962
Is he your boyfriend?
Is that...

37:11.080 --> 37:13.003
Stop it! Do not...
He is not my...

37:13.080 --> 37:14.720
Mom, focus,
we're talking about Amsterdam.

37:14.744 --> 37:17.395
I like him so much. I...
Stop.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.001
Pay attention.
Please! Can I go?

37:20.080 --> 37:23.289
Right, as your mom,
I love this idea.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.966
And I... I think we
should talk to Dr. Maria.

37:31.960 --> 37:32.961
Okay-

37:33.560 --> 37:34.561
I don't know.

37:34.680 --> 37:35.920
But you said that
the PET scan was encouraging.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.769
Well, the PET scan
is encouraging,

37:37.840 --> 37:40.047
but we don't know how long
it will stay that way.

37:40.160 --> 37:43.642
Okay, I'm not seeking political asylum.
It's a few days. It's a vacation!

37:43.760 --> 37:45.205
It's true.
What if you get sick?

37:45.320 --> 37:46.765
In a foreign country?

37:46.840 --> 37:49.844
They have doctors in
Amsterdam. And cancer.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.766
Well, not all cancers are alike, and
yours is particularly unusual, Hazel.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.402
The only way I could ever
authorize a trip like this

37:57.520 --> 37:59.648
would be if someone
familiar with your case...

37:59.760 --> 38:01.410
What if my mom came?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.370
Wait, what?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.125
What if you came?

38:05.240 --> 38:07.766
I'm... I'm sure the Genies would
hook it up. They're loaded.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.723

Fluid in the lungs

No new tumors in your body.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.809
We're so relieved.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.725
This is just a thing, Hazel.

39:32.280 --> 39:34.851
It's a thing we can live with.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.481
How's she doing?

39:43.680 --> 39:44.727
Better.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.122
Yeah, thank you.
Much, much better.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.851
Uh, they won't let me in.
It's family only.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.411

Yeah, I get it.

39:53.720 --> 39:54.926
Um...

39:55.800 --> 39:57.325
Could you just
tell her I was here?

39:57.720 --> 39:59.802
Yeah, of course.
Of course I will.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.209
Okay. Gus, listen, why
don't you go home?

40:03.400 --> 40:05.243

start resisting the treatment...

Yet.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.004

40:22.160 --> 40:25.243

worsening the edema.

DR. MARIA:
The truth is...

40:26.440 --> 40:30.047
very few people have been on
Phalanxifor as long as Hazel has.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.960
We really don't know
the long-term effects.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.407
What we're trying to do is
prevent endothelial growth...

40:34.560 --> 40:40.044
which, when overexpressed, can
contribute to disease, decay...

40:40.200 --> 40:41.565
vascular inhibition...

40:41.720 --> 40:44.200
and the spread of the tumors

40:44.280 --> 40:46.681
we're working so hard
to eradicate.

40:46.880 --> 40:49.451
The survival rate of patients
with severe endothelial growth...

40:49.600 --> 40:53.286

more the condition advances.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.730
Yes, Hazel?

41:17.880 --> 41:19.484
Can I still go to Amsterdam?

41:19.640 --> 41:22.211
That would not be wise
at this juncture.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.681
Why not? ls there any way we
can make that trip happen?

41:24.760 --> 41:27.240
It would increase some risks.

41:29.240 --> 41:30.810
Yes, but an airplane?

I hope you realize...

45:52.440 --> 45:54.200
that you trying to
keep your distance from me

45:54.224 --> 45:56.963
in no way lessens
my affection for you.

45:57.120 --> 46:00.761
All your efforts to keep me
from you are gonna fail.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.850
Look. Uh...

46:04.680 --> 46:06.091
I like you.

46:07.560 --> 46:10.609
And I like hanging out
with you and everything...

46:10.760 --> 46:13.730
but I can't let this
go on any further.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.001
Why not?

46:16.480 --> 46:17.925
Because I don't
want to hurt you.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.411
(STAMMERING) I wouldn't mind.

46:19.560 --> 46:21.200
No, you don't understand.
I do understand.

46:21.224 --> 46:22.127
You don't understand.

46:22.200 --> 46:23.486
I know what
you're trying to say.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.802
Hazel, I'm saying
I wouldn't mind.

46:25.960 --> 46:28.566
It'd be a privilege to have
my heart broken by you.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.728
Gus, I'm a grenade.

46:35.560 --> 46:36.686
One day I'm gonna explode...

46:36.840 --> 46:39.207
and I'm gonna obliterate
everything in my wake and...

46:40.720 --> 46:42.882
I don't know, I feel like
it's my responsibility...

46:43.040 --> 46:44.883
to minimize the casualties.

46:48.080 --> 46:49.809
A grenade?

46:51.880 --> 46:54.360
I mean, that's why I
don't have a hamster.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.126
(LAUGHS)

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.766
I like your suit.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.201
Thank you. It's the first
time I've ever worn it.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.960
That's not the suit
you wear to funerals?

01:01:30.984 --> 01:01:32.041
No.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.770
That one is not
nearly this nice.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.290
When I first got sick...

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.411
they told me I had an 85 percent
chance of being cancer-free.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.487
Great odds.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.605
But that meant a year of
torture, the loss of my leg...

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.121
and, still, a 15 percent
chance it might fail.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.206
Just before the surgery...

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.490
I asked my parents if I could
buy a really nice suit.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.201
So, it's your death suit.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.806
That's what it is.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.725
I have one of those. I got it
for my fifteenth birthday.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.120
A dress.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.321
I don't necessarily think I'd
wear it on a date, though.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.606
So, we're on a date?

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.368
Hey, you watch it.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.641
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.643
We are Mr.
And Mrs. Waters.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.400
Oh. That's just because
she can't speak English.

01:02:19.424 --> 01:02:22.288
We should be, though, if they ask.
You know?

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.800
Remember what you
said about Vegas?

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:24.824
GUS: Yeah.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.800
HAZEL: Do you think I could
join in on that deal?

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.806
GUS: God?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.206
HAZEL: Maybe.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.081
GUS: How about angels?

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.161
HAZEL: Mmm, no.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.605
GUS: Afterlife?
Mmm...

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.727
No.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.086
Well, maybe.
I don't know.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.160
I guess I wouldn't go
as far as to say "no"...

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.811
but I would like some evidence.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.605
What about you?

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.809
Absolutely.
Really?

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.611
I mean, not like a heaven where
you ride on a unicorn all day...

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.842
and live in a mansion
made of clouds...

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.209
but yes, I definitely
believe in something.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.444
I mean, otherwise...

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.284
what's the point?

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.048
Maybe there is no point.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.925
I won't accept that.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.922
I am in love with you.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.366
You heard me.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.361
Augustus...

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.925
I am in love with you.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.800
And I know that love is just
a shout into the void...

01:03:27.824 --> 01:03:29.210
and that oblivion is inevitable.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.850
And that we're all doomed...

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.731
and that one day...

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.290
all of our labors
will be returned to dust.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.202
And I know that
the sun will swallow

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.282
the only Earth
we will ever have.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.569
And I am in love with you.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.486
Sorry.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.161
More stars?

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.401
No, thank you.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.642
I think we'll just
have the check.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.926
No, sir.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.571
Your meal has been paid
by Mr. Van Houten.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.365
What?

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.647
(BAND PLAYING
DRAMATIC CLASSICAL MUSIC)

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.561
I don't really get that shirt.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.846
HAZEL: Mmm.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.168
But Van Houten will get it.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.961
There are, like, fifty Magritte

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.761
But it is a pipe.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.286
But it's not.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.685
It is a drawing of a pipe.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.841
See?

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.209
A drawing of a thing
is not the thing itself.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.564
Nor is a T-shirt of a drawing
of a thing, the thing itself.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.721
Hey, you.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.723

This is it.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.087
I'm so excited,
I can barely breathe.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.325
As opposed to normal?

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.883

Hi!
Hi, I'm Augustus.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.367
Lidewij.
Hazel.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.601
Please, come in.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.801
Thank you.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.050
Peter! They're here!

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.248
VAN HOUTEN: Who the hell
is "they," Lidewij?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.243
They are Augustus and Hazel...

you've been corresponding.

The Americans?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.050
LIDEWIJ:
You invited them.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.690
Please, come in.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.760
VAN HOUTEN: You know
why I left America, Lidewij.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.766
To never have to
encounter Americans.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.330
You're American.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.206
VAN HOUTEN:
incurably so.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.811
Get rid of them.

do this, Peter.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.770
Please, be nice.

Come in, please.

Sorry, let me
clear this for you.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.926
Thank you.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.646
Which of you is Augustus Waters?

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.247
I am.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.371
And that's Hazel.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.240
Mr. Van Houten, thank you so
much for writing back to us.

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:48.644
Clearly an error in judgment.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.286
Yours are the first missives
to which I've replied,

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.566

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.041
Uh...

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.641
No, thank you.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.330
Just me, then, Lidewij.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.448
Another scotch and soda, please.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.448
Perhaps some
breakfast first, Peter?

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.210
She thinks I have
a drinking problem.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.048
I also think the Earth is round.

(MOCKING LAUGH)

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:21.085
So, you like my book.

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:22.321
We love your book.
Yeah.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:23.890
We love it.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.361
Augustus...

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.490
He made his wish meeting
you so that we could talk.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.688
GUS: No pressure.
HAZEL: Yeah.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.044
Did you dress
like her on purpose?

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.841
Kind of.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:40.290
And, incidentally, sir,
we both really

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:42.124
wanted to thank you
for dinner last night.

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:43.850
And for the champagne.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.001
It was amazing.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:46.611
It was magical.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.569
We bought them
dinner last night?

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.889

We have some questions...

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.410
obviously, about what happens
at the end of your book.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.201
Uh, specifically to those
who Anna leaves behind.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:10.442
Like her mom,
the Dutch Tulip Man...

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.080
How familiar are you
with Swedish hip-hop?

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.363
I would say, limited.

Who the hell speaks Swedish?

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.528
The important thing is not what
nonsense the voices are saying...

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.842
but what the voices are feeling.

sort of performance?

Gus, sit down.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.680
All right, so at the end
of the book, Anna's...

01:10:56.704 --> 01:10:59.310
Let's imagine
you're racing a tortoise.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.564
The tortoise has
a ten-yard head start.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.529
In the time it takes you
to run ten yards...

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.968
the tortoise has moved maybe
one yard, and so on, forever.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.400
You're faster than the tortoise,

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.647
but you can never
catch him, you see?

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.280
You can only decrease his lead.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.920
Now, certainly, you can
run past the tortoise...

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.283
as long as you don't contemplate
the mechanics involved.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.087
But the question
of "how?"

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.924
turns out to be
so complicated...

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.009
that no one really solved it...

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.642

are bigger than
other infinities.

I assume that answers
your question.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.607
Hazel, I'm sorry. I have
no idea what's going on.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.003
Yet you seemed so intelligent
in print, Mr. Waters.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.728

way into your brain?

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.606
Please?

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.644
I understand that the story ends

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.920
in the middle of a sentence...

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.521
because she dies, or that she
becomes too sick to continue...

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.520
I am not interested
in talking about that book.

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:10.630

and friends don't have a future, right?

01:12:10.654 --> 01:12:11.654
Right?

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.806
I said I'm not interested.

moment the novel ends.

out your days... Peter!

were when diagnosed.

A child who believes there is
a life after a novel ends.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.765
And we as adults, we pity this.

her yet, Isaac.

Oh.

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.682
I need speakers at my funeral.

that you and Isaac,

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.250

Nope, not a thing.

She hasn't even texted you

I hate that girl.

you, for everyone to love you.

I have to go.

Hazel, you have to be hungry.
You didn't even eat lunch.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.161
I'm just not hungry.

got to take care of yourself.

Okay, I'm not healthy,

to look after, or hover around...

and you're not gonna be a mother
anymore, and I'm sorry...

I can do about that.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.604
Why would you say that to me?

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.091

"forever."

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:21.488
Augustus Waters
fought hard for many years.

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.601
His battle was a courageous
one, and his strength...

01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:28.410
What a load of shit, huh, kid?

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:30.840
...was a source of inspiration
for each and every one of us.

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.771
Let us pray.

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.601
We thank You, Lord, for the
life of Augustus Waters...

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.325
We need to
fake-pray now.

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.484
MINISTER: ...for his
strength and his courage.

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:47.287
Lord, we ask that You be with
us today, that You be close...

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:50.011
that You comfort
his friends and family.

01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:52.003
Thank You for
Your presence, Lord.

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:54.569
All this we pray in Jesus' name.

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.121
Amen.

01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:57.486
ALL: Amen.

01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:02.681
Now, we are going to hear
from Gus' special friend...

01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:05.002
Hazel Lancaster.

01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.845
Not that it really matters,
but I was his girlfriend.

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:03.761
There's a beautiful quote
in Gus' home that reads...

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:06.201
"if you want the rainbow, you
have to deal with the rain."

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.086
Even in his last few days...

01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.727
Um...

01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:15.006
<i>I didn't believe a word.</i>

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.481
He was always able
to crack a smile.

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.690
<i>But that's okay.</i>

01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:25.290
<i>I knew this was
the right thing to do.</i>

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.325
<i>Funerals, I'd decided,
are not for the dead.</i>

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.280
<i>They're for the living.</i>

01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:35.129
Hey, want some company?

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.281
No, I'm okay.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.962
I'm just gonna drive
for a bit by myself.

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.321
Love you.

01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:44.571
Love you.

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:46.406
You spoke beautifully.

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.051
I'll see you soon.
Drive safe.

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.281
Okay-

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:16.281
VAN HOUTEN: May I?

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:21.809
<i>Omnis cellula e cellula.</i>

01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:27.362
Your boy Waters and I corresponded
quite a bit in his last days.

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:29.488
Oh. So, you read
your fan mail now?

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.569
I wouldn't exactly
call him a fan.

01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.165
He detested me.

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:37.287
But he was quite insistent
I attend his funeral...

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:39.681
and tell you what became
of Anna and her mother...

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:41.609
so here I am.

01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:44.526
And that's your answer,
"Omnis cellula e cellula."

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:45.846
"Life comes from life."

01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:48.440
I'm really not in the mood.

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.720
You don't want an explanation?

01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.211
No, I don't.

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.488
Thank you, though.
Have a great life.

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:55.644
You remind me of her.

01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.921
(SCOFFS)

01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:00.044
I remind a lot of people
of a lot of people.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.804
My daughter was eight.

01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:09.447
And she suffered
beautifully for so long.

01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:13.808
She had leukemia like Anna?

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:16.490
Just like Anna.

01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:22.890
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:26.249
And I'm sorry for yours. And
sorry for ruining your trip.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.729
You didn't ruin our trip.

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:30.405
We had an amazing trip.
(CHUCKLES)

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:37.080
Are you familiar
with the Trolley Problem?

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:41.040
There's a thought experiment
in the field of ethics...

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.964
known as the Trolley Problem.

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:45.043
Philippa Foot was
an English philosopher...

01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:46.526
Oh, my God.

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:49.008
Hazel, I'm trying to
explain something to you.

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.720
I'm trying to give you
what you wanted.

01:59:50.744 --> 01:59:51.367
No, you're not!

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:53.170
You are a drunk,
and you're a failure...

01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:55.200
and I need you to get out
of my car right now...

01:59:55.224 --> 01:59:58.751
so that I can go home, and
be by myself and grieve!

01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:01.364
You'll want to read this.

02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:05.530
I don't want to read anything.

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.204
Can you just get out of my car?

02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:13.246
Please get out of my car!

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.401
Fine.

02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:15.927
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:19.806
(ENGINE STARTS)

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.285
(SIGHS)

02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.449
Can I come in?

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:37.409
I'm so, so sorry.

02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.091
Yeah.

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:51.240
It was a privilege,
though, wasn't it?

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:52.765
To love him?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.890
Gives you an idea
how we feel about you.

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:17.245
FRANNIE: Hazel?

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.207
There's a friend
here to see you.

02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:24.166
(SIGHS) Do you know if
it hurt or whatever?

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:28.883
Apparently he was struggling
for breath for a long time...

02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:31.725
and then eventually
he just went unconscious.

02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:34.485
It wasn't great or anything.

02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:37.370
Dying sucks.

02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:41.484
Gus really loved you, you know?

02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:43.400
I know.

02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:47.483
He wouldn't shut up about it.
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.047
Yeah.

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.090
It was annoying. He
talked about you so much.

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:53.571
I didn't find it that annoying.

02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.081
I know.
I know you didn't.

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:03.526
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:07.527
Did you get that letter
from your author friend?

02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:09.530
Ew. He's not my friend.

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:11.240
How do you know about that?

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:13.120
Well, I was talking
to him at the cemetery...

02:03:13.144 --> 02:03:17.050
and he said he came all this way
to give that letter to you.

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:19.362
Yeah, well, I'm over it.

02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:22.444
I have no interest in reading another
word of that asshole's again.

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.443
No, he didn't write it.
Gus wrote it.

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.046
What?

02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.770
Apparently Gus wrote
something down

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.365
and then sent it to Van Houten.

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:33.890
Oh, my God.

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.204
<i>GUS: Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good
person, but a shitty writer.</i>

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:50.885
<i>You're a shitty person,
but a good writer.</i>

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:53.088
<i>I think we'd make a good team.</i>

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.890
<i>I don't want to ask you
for any favors...</i>

02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:58.328
<i>but if you have the time, and from
what I saw, you have plenty...</i>

02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:00.050
<i>please fix this for me.</i>

02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.402
<i>It's a eulogy for Hazel.</i>

02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.760
<i>She asked me to write one,
and I'm trying.</i>

02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:11.248
<i>I just...
I could use a little flair.</i>

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:14.730
<i>See, the thing is, we all
want to be remembered.</i>

02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:18.845
<i>But Hazel's different.</i>

02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:21.444
<i>Hazel knows the truth.</i>

02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:25.247
<i>She didn't want a million admirers.
She just wanted one.</i>

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:26.606
<i>And she got it.</i>

02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.687
<i>Maybe she wasn't loved widely,
but she was loved deeply.</i>

02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:33.481
<i>And isn't that more
than most of us get?</i>

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:38.967
<i>When Hazel was sick,
I knew I was dying...</i>

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.282
<i>but I didn't want to say so.</i>

02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:48.487
<i>She was in the ICU, and I
snuck in for 10 minutes...</i>

02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:51.450
<i>and I sat with her,
before I got caught.</i>

02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:55.805
<i>Her eyes were closed.
Her skin, pale.</i>

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.281
<i>But her hands
were still her hands.</i>

02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:02.122
<i>Still warm, and her nails were painted
this dark blue-black color...</i>

02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.170
<i>and I just held them.</i>

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.130
<i>And I willed myself to imagine
a world without us...</i>

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.321
<i>and what a worthless world
that would be.</i>

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:16.642
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:18.884
<i>You don't get tired
of looking at her.</i>

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:20.760
<i>You never worry if she's
smarter than you...</i>

02:05:20.784 --> 02:05:22.548
<i>because you know she is.</i>

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:26.640
<i>She's funny without
ever being mean.</i>

02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:30.051
<i>I love her.</i>

02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:31.801
<i>God, I love her.</i>

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.526
<i>I'm so lucky to love her,
Van Houten.</i>

02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:44.960
<i>You don't get to choose if you
get hurt in this world...</i>

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.163
<i>but you do have a say
in who hurts you.</i>

02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:50.842
<i>And I like my choices.</i>

02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:54.048
<i>I hope she likes hers.</i>

02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:56.924
<i>Okay, Hazel Grace?</i>

02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:00.731
Okay-
