00:12.868 --> 00:14.667
As soon as I get the recording,

00:14.734 --> 00:16.033
we're going to have
to involve your father.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.601
You know I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.467
Tell me what this is all about.

00:20.534 --> 00:22.501
I will. I just
need a minute.

00:22.567 --> 00:25.234
I decide what needs
to be done, Mr. Anderson.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.801
I never authorized you
to kill David Palmer.

00:27.868 --> 00:28.934
President Logan?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.901
And a man named
Christopher Henderson.

00:30.968 --> 00:33.400
I know what you did.
I know what you're doing.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.234
And I'm going
to put an end to it.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.701
You asked to see me,
Mr. President?

00:36.767 --> 00:38.701
Hal, I'm asking Secretary Heller

00:38.767 --> 00:40.033
to tender his resignation

00:40.100 --> 00:42.567
and I wanted you
here as a witness.
What?!

00:42.634 --> 00:44.234
He came here to accuse me
of being complicit

00:44.300 --> 00:46.367
in today's
terrorist attacks.

00:46.434 --> 00:47.601
Miles set me up.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.601
Please come with us,
Ms. O'Brian.

00:49.667 --> 00:50.901
We traced your call

00:50.968 --> 00:53.133
to a public phone
at Van Nuys Airport.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.901
If Audrey Raines is
at that location,

00:54.968 --> 00:56.067
you're in a lot of trouble.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.100
You're supposed
to be in custody.

01:01.167 --> 01:04.132
You helped Audrey Raines
break surveillance.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.934
You're sick and you need help
and if you try to stop me,

01:07.000 --> 01:09.067
I will recommend you for
psychiatric evaluation.

01:09.133 --> 01:12.634
I haven't been able
to contact Jack or Audrey.

01:12.701 --> 01:14.501
I haven't talked
to them either.

01:14.567 --> 01:17.267
Whatever you tell me will remain
between the two of us.

01:17.334 --> 01:19.100
I promise you.

01:19.167 --> 01:20.834
Not here.

01:20.901 --> 01:22.834
Outside the south stable.

01:22.901 --> 01:24.801
Is Bauer dead?

01:24.868 --> 01:26.367
Not yet, Mr. President.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.501
He has the recording.
Yes, sir.

01:28.567 --> 01:30.467
That evidence directly
implicates me

01:30.534 --> 01:32.467
in David Palmer's death.

01:32.534 --> 01:33.901
Son of a bitch.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.234
What the hell's going on?!

01:35.300 --> 01:36.501
They've come
for the recording.

01:45.801 --> 01:48.033
Audrey!

01:48.100 --> 01:49.167
I have her, Jack!

01:49.234 --> 01:52.100
JACK:
What have you done to her?

01:52.167 --> 01:53.834
The left
brachial artery.

01:53.901 --> 01:56.200
She has about three minutes
before she bleeds to death.

01:56.267 --> 01:57.601
Now throw me
that recording.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.634
Jack, don't do it.

01:59.701 --> 02:02.467
She's running out of time.

02:02.534 --> 02:04.801
AUDREY:
Don't give it up.
Here it is.

02:16.234 --> 02:17.968
Stay with me.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.000
Stay with me.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.334
( <i>panting</i> )

02:27.801 --> 02:32.033
I need to loosen
the tourniquet.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.133
Oh! Ooh!

02:34.200 --> 02:36.501
Good. The bleeding's stopped,
which means he didn't sever

02:36.567 --> 02:37.767
the brachial artery.

02:37.834 --> 02:39.701
I need to get you
to a doctor.
Jack,

02:39.767 --> 02:41.501
I can wait.
Do what you have to do.

02:41.567 --> 02:42.634
Are you sure?
Yes.

02:42.701 --> 02:45.267
Keep your arm
elevated.

02:45.334 --> 02:46.634
( <i>panting</i> )

02:46.701 --> 02:49.100
( <i>touch tone beeping</i> )

02:49.167 --> 02:51.701
FEMALE VOICE:
Chloe O'Brian is not available.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.701
Chloe's not picking
up her phone.

02:53.767 --> 02:56.501
Is there someone else who can
help you track Henderson?

02:56.567 --> 02:59.701
No one who has the same access
to the CTU satellite network.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.501
Jack, I'm so sorry.
This is my fault.

03:01.567 --> 03:02.634
Audrey, stop it.

03:02.701 --> 03:04.934
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

03:05.000 --> 03:07.267
I'll be right back.

03:07.334 --> 03:10.601
( <i>ringing continues</i> )

03:19.767 --> 03:21.367
This is Jack Bauer.

03:21.434 --> 03:22.501
Jack?

03:22.567 --> 03:24.734
Why are you answering
Wexler's phone?

03:24.801 --> 03:26.300
Wexler's dead.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.701
Henderson and a commando unit
attacked us 15 minutes ago.

03:28.767 --> 03:30.701
They killed all your men and
took the recording back.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.901
Is Audrey all right?

03:32.968 --> 03:34.067
She's fine.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.701
Did you cut your
deal with Logan?

03:35.767 --> 03:38.033
Logan accepted my terms.

03:38.100 --> 03:41.267
Then he took a call,
and suddenly changed his mind.

03:41.334 --> 03:42.667
That call must have come
from Henderson.

03:42.734 --> 03:44.267
Jack, we have to get
the recording back.

03:44.334 --> 03:47.601
If there's anything I can do
to help, let me know.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.033
With all due respect,
Mr. Secretary,

03:49.100 --> 03:51.400
I asked you for your help,
and you betrayed me.

03:51.467 --> 03:55.234
Jack, I did what I thought
was best for this country.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.767
I made a mistake.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.601
Please forgive me.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.434
I need to go, sir.

04:04.334 --> 04:06.467
( <i>panting</i> )

04:07.501 --> 04:08.901
( <i>touch tones beeping</i> )

04:08.968 --> 04:11.300
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

04:11.367 --> 04:12.834
Hello?

04:12.901 --> 04:14.033
Bill, it's Jack.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.834
Jack, we've been waiting
to hear from you.

04:15.901 --> 04:17.666
Did you get the recording
to Secretary Heller?

04:17.733 --> 04:19.100
I don't have
time to explain.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.634
Henderson's got
the recording.
I need Chloe

04:20.701 --> 04:22.801
to help me find him,
but I can't reach her.

04:22.868 --> 04:24.000
Chloe's here
with me, Jack.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.434
She was arrested
by Homeland Security

04:25.501 --> 04:27.267
for helping you, but
she managed to get away.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.267
Put her on speaker.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.467
Jack, where are you?

04:30.534 --> 04:32.033
I'm at Van Nuys Airfield.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.767
Chloe, listen to me.
Henderson left here

04:33.834 --> 04:36.300
ten minutes ago with a recording
that implicates President Logan.

04:36.367 --> 04:38.634
I need you to access CTU's
satellite data streams

04:38.701 --> 04:39.868
so that we can find him.

04:39.934 --> 04:41.234
If I log onto their system,

04:41.300 --> 04:43.100
they're gonna find me
eventually, no matter what I do.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.567
I don't need you
to track him for long.

04:44.634 --> 04:45.968
Do you think you can do it?

04:46.033 --> 04:47.968
I guess I can try
to slip in through the subnets.

04:48.033 --> 04:49.534
Get back to me when you're in.

04:49.601 --> 04:52.634
I'll set up a VPN pathway, so
that they can't trace our call,

04:52.701 --> 04:55.033
but it will only work
with the phone you're using.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.601
Okay. I got a hold
of Chloe. We need to go.

04:57.667 --> 04:58.801
Okay.
Can you get up?

04:58.868 --> 05:00.033
Yeah.
Slowly.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.167
( <i>groans</i> )

05:03.234 --> 05:05.300
Come on.

05:05.367 --> 05:06.968
If we're going to do
extensive satellite tracking,

05:07.033 --> 05:08.501
I need more
than my laptop.

05:08.567 --> 05:10.400
I'm gonna have to network
onto your computer, even though

05:10.467 --> 05:11.901
it's kind of pathetic, and

05:11.968 --> 05:14.567
I need you to get that screen
to work for me.
All right.

05:14.634 --> 05:16.767
I hope you don't mind me
bossing you around,

05:16.834 --> 05:18.734
but technically,
I don't work for you anymore.

05:18.801 --> 05:21.634
That's all right, Chloe.
Good.

05:21.701 --> 05:23.667
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

05:23.734 --> 05:25.734
( <i>soft groan</i> )

05:25.801 --> 05:27.501
Oh.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.834
Bauer.

05:30.901 --> 05:32.434
Jack, I'm pulling up
satellite footage

05:32.501 --> 05:34.634
of the airfield
from 15 minutes ago.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.567
Look for an explosion
in the northwest corner.

05:36.634 --> 05:37.567
Okay, I see it.

05:37.634 --> 05:38.601
About five minutes after that,

05:38.667 --> 05:39.601
a vehicle leaves the airfield.

05:39.667 --> 05:40.934
That'll be Henderson.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
He went south
on the service drive, and east

05:43.067 --> 05:45.133
on Menders, then I lose him
on the grid.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.367
Use another satellite,
traffic cams,

05:46.434 --> 05:48.067
whatever you have to,
just find him.

05:48.133 --> 05:49.434
It's gonna take us
a few minutes.

05:49.501 --> 05:51.267
We're just setting up,
but we're on it.
Copy that.

05:51.334 --> 05:54.701
Get back to me as soon
as you got him on a live feed.

05:56.734 --> 05:58.300
( <i>engine starting</i> )

06:02.901 --> 06:05.701
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

06:05.767 --> 06:08.100
( <i>groans</i> )

06:09.667 --> 06:12.200
What makes you think that

06:12.267 --> 06:13.968
Henderson hasn't already

06:14.033 --> 06:15.367
destroyed the recording?

06:15.434 --> 06:17.501
He would have done it
immediately, in front of me.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.634
Given me less of a reason
to come after him.

06:19.701 --> 06:21.234
Why would he keep it?

06:21.300 --> 06:24.000
It's his insurance.

06:26.501 --> 06:28.501
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

06:28.567 --> 06:29.767
Yes.

06:29.834 --> 06:30.901
Is Bauer dead?

06:30.968 --> 06:32.100
No.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.133
What happened?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.234
All that matters is

06:34.300 --> 06:36.000
that I have the recording.

06:36.067 --> 06:38.567
Have you destroyed it?

06:38.634 --> 06:39.901
No, sir, I have not.

06:39.968 --> 06:41.634
Why, what's the problem?

06:41.701 --> 06:44.267
Actually, I'm making sure
they're won't <i>be</i> any problems.

06:44.334 --> 06:45.467
I don't understand.

06:45.534 --> 06:46.968
I may need protection.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.434
That recording
gives it to me.

06:48.501 --> 06:49.801
Protection?

06:49.868 --> 06:51.634
Yes, sir.

06:51.701 --> 06:54.167
Do you mean from me?

06:54.234 --> 06:55.467
That's absurd.

06:55.534 --> 06:57.601
With all due respect,
Mr. President,

06:57.667 --> 07:01.434
it isn't absurd, as evidenced
by Walt Cummings suicide.

07:01.501 --> 07:03.634
That was different.

07:03.701 --> 07:07.767
You told me yourself
that was necessary.

07:07.834 --> 07:09.234
And I'm assuming
that one day,

07:09.300 --> 07:11.767
others will tell you
the very same thing about me.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.767
Chris,

07:13.834 --> 07:16.234
you and I have been in
this from the beginning.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.100
Destroying
that recording

07:18.167 --> 07:19.634
protects both of us.

07:19.701 --> 07:21.934
I'm sorry,
Mr. President.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.701
I give you my word it will be
kept in a very place safe,

07:24.767 --> 07:26.868
and will only be made public
should I meet

07:26.934 --> 07:29.200
with some... accident.

07:29.267 --> 07:31.300
Chris, this is completely
unnecessary.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.067
I'm sure it is, sir.

07:33.133 --> 07:37.701
Then again,
I am a very cautious man.

07:45.534 --> 07:46.634
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

07:46.701 --> 07:48.067
Chloe, have you
got Henderson yet?

07:48.133 --> 07:49.467
Yes, his car is
three quarters

07:49.534 --> 07:51.767
of a mile in
front of you.
He had a head start.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.334
He should be farther
along than that.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.868
I don't know
what to tell you.

07:54.934 --> 07:56.501
It's definitely the car
he left the airport in.

07:56.567 --> 07:57.801
How long until
I've got a visual?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.267
The road curves up
ahead, Jack.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.167
You should be able to see him
once it straightens out.

08:01.234 --> 08:03.267
Hold on.

08:08.434 --> 08:12.701
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

08:12.767 --> 08:14.534
Got him.

08:14.601 --> 08:16.868
( <i>engine revving</i> )

08:19.968 --> 08:21.868
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

08:21.934 --> 08:25.367

08:34.234 --> 08:35.933
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

08:38.067 --> 08:38.900
Get down.

08:59.467 --> 09:00.200
( <i>chamber clicks empty</i> )

09:00.267 --> 09:02.234
Damn!

09:12.701 --> 09:14.167
It's over, Christopher.

09:15.701 --> 09:16.734
Turn around!

09:18.934 --> 09:22.534
Put the gun down and keep
your hands where I can them.

09:22.601 --> 09:24.834
Do it or I will kill you!

09:27.000 --> 09:30.868
You kill me, Jack,
Secretary Heller dies, too.

09:30.934 --> 09:32.267
What are you talking about?

09:32.334 --> 09:35.334
There's always a contingency
plan, Jack. You know that.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.834
My men have been tracking Heller
from a chopper ever since

09:38.901 --> 09:40.467
he left Logan's Retreat.

09:40.534 --> 09:42.934
Now, if I can't
contact them

09:43.000 --> 09:44.567
every 15 minutes on the dot,

09:44.634 --> 09:46.734
they have orders
to kill Secretary Heller.

09:46.801 --> 09:47.934
Which means,
you got about

09:48.000 --> 09:50.100
three minutes to save his life.

09:50.167 --> 09:51.234
Jack?

09:51.300 --> 09:54.067
Audrey, please get back
in the car.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.801
Is he lying about my father?

09:56.834 --> 09:58.968
Slowly walk towards me.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.100
Put your hands
behind your head.

10:03.167 --> 10:08.501
Get on your knees.

10:08.567 --> 10:09.634
Cuff yourself.

10:16.067 --> 10:17.367
( <i>touch tones beeping</i> )

10:17.434 --> 10:19.100
Yeah, Jack.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.801
Chloe, patch me through to
Secretary Heller's cell phone.

10:21.868 --> 10:24.367
See if you can get a satellite
to lock on his signal.

10:24.434 --> 10:27.300
I need you to download a visual
of his vehicle on my PDA.

10:27.367 --> 10:30.267
He was leaving Logan's retreat
just before 1:00.

10:30.334 --> 10:32.667
On it. Open up the parallel
channel on the NSA's landsats,

10:32.734 --> 10:34.767
can radial slices
in three mile increments,

10:34.834 --> 10:37.300
emanating from the
Retreat... sir.

10:37.367 --> 10:39.534
Okay, Jack, I'm pulling up
the DOD database.

10:39.601 --> 10:42.067
Here it is,
I'm patching you through.

10:42.133 --> 10:43.234
Copy that.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.834
( <i>phone ringing through</i> )

10:46.434 --> 10:48.400
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

10:48.467 --> 10:49.634
Heller.

10:49.701 --> 10:51.067
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.133
I need you to confirm for me
if a helicopter's been

10:53.200 --> 10:54.167
tracking your vehicle?

10:54.234 --> 10:55.300
What's going on, Jack?

10:55.367 --> 10:56.767
Sir, time is critical.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.400
Is there a helicopter
above you or not?

11:02.601 --> 11:03.801
Yeah, there's a chopper
above me.

11:03.868 --> 11:04.968
Who are they?

11:05.033 --> 11:06.133
Henderson's men.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.734
He claims he's given them orders
to kill you

11:07.801 --> 11:08.868
if I don't let him go.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.334
Is he bluffing?

11:10.400 --> 11:12.801
He doesn't do that, sir.

11:14.234 --> 11:15.634
CHLOE:
Jack, I've got Heller's car.

11:15.701 --> 11:17.367
I'm patching it
through to your PDA.

11:17.434 --> 11:18.534
Copy that.

11:20.434 --> 11:22.868
( <i>helicopter propeller</i>
<i>whirring</i> )

11:26.567 --> 11:29.701
Jack... they have a laser sight

11:29.767 --> 11:31.901
trained on me.

11:31.968 --> 11:33.400
Get up.

11:37.434 --> 11:39.868
You give me the recording,
I let you go: that's the deal.

11:39.934 --> 11:40.934
No.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.701
Come on, Jack,
you're wasting time.

11:42.767 --> 11:44.934
We both know you're not going
to let Heller die.

11:45.033 --> 11:47.734
I can hear him, Jack;
don't let him do this.
I'm going to walk

11:47.801 --> 11:49.300
out of here, Jack,
and you're not gonna stop me,

11:49.367 --> 11:51.100
so uncuff me.

11:51.167 --> 11:52.968
Jack, don't let him go.

11:53.033 --> 11:54.033
I don't have
a choice, sir.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.067
Yes, you do.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.801
If I had listened to you
in the first place,

11:57.868 --> 11:58.901
none of this would be happening.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.033
This is my responsibility,

12:01.100 --> 12:05.367
I will not allow Logan and
Henderson to use me as a pawn.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.501
Sir?

12:06.567 --> 12:08.267
Do not let them
get away with this.

12:08.334 --> 12:12.667
Make sure that the recording
gets to the right people.

12:14.701 --> 12:17.901
Tell Audrey I love her.

12:17.968 --> 12:19.400
Mr. Secretary,
what are you doing?!

12:19.467 --> 12:21.000
No.

12:23.968 --> 12:25.501
( <i>engine revving</i> )

12:32.901 --> 12:37.100
( <i>helicopter propeller</i>
<i>whirring</i> )

12:44.367 --> 12:46.634
JACK:
Chloe, are you still
on the line?!

12:46.701 --> 12:48.167
Can you confirm that Heller

12:48.234 --> 12:49.834
just drove his car
into the lake?

12:51.300 --> 12:52.701
Yes.

12:53.701 --> 12:55.200
Damn you!

12:55.267 --> 12:57.200
Oh, my God, no.

13:03.767 --> 13:06.434
How could you do this?

13:06.501 --> 13:10.167
This isn't about what you think
is best for the country.

13:10.234 --> 13:12.767
This is about your greed
for power.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.601
Today, you have been
responsible

13:14.667 --> 13:16.934
for killing an ex-president,
David Palmer,

13:17.000 --> 13:18.367
and the secretary of defense,

13:18.434 --> 13:20.701
two real patriots.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.367
Damn you!

13:23.601 --> 13:25.334
What happened to you?

13:27.968 --> 13:29.234
Give me the recording.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.367
I don't have it.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.133
Where is it?!

13:32.200 --> 13:33.667
I'm not going to
tell you, Jack.

13:33.734 --> 13:36.234
and you know that-- no
matter what you do to me.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.367
AUDREY:
Do it.

13:38.434 --> 13:40.334
Kill him, Jack. Do it!

13:59.400 --> 14:00.500
MAN:
Yeah.
Graham?

14:00.567 --> 14:02.367
Yes.

14:02.433 --> 14:05.333
You need to cancel the action
against Henderson immediately.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.766
Why?

14:06.833 --> 14:08.799
He has the recording,
but he's made arrangements

14:08.866 --> 14:10.866
to have it released
if anything happens to him.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.433
You should have exercised
more control over him.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.200
There's a limit
to how much I can do.

14:16.267 --> 14:18.766
Apparently.
Don't.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.300
Don't you use that tone with me.

14:20.367 --> 14:21.700
We've both made mistakes today.

14:21.766 --> 14:24.600
You're right, Mr. President,
my apologies,

14:24.667 --> 14:29.066
but the fact is, I think we have
a bigger problem than Henderson.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.033
What? What are you
talking about?

14:31.100 --> 14:33.033
At least he can be trusted
to act rationally,

14:33.100 --> 14:34.367
in his own interest.

14:34.433 --> 14:36.600
Unfortunately, the same
is not true of your wife.

14:39.866 --> 14:41.166
My wife.

14:41.233 --> 14:42.567
Apparently,

14:42.634 --> 14:44.267
there's a secret service agent
named Aaron Pierce

14:44.333 --> 14:46.000
who knows a little more
than he should.

14:46.066 --> 14:47.500
He intends to share that
with Martha.

14:47.567 --> 14:48.933
I'm well aware of that,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.766
and I've taken steps
to deal with Agent Pierce.

14:50.833 --> 14:51.866
But the real problem

14:51.933 --> 14:53.300
is Mrs. Logan.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.333
She continues to talk,
to ask questions,

14:55.400 --> 14:56.766
talk about her suspicions.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.300
People don't take her seriously.

14:58.367 --> 14:59.600
They think she's unstable.

14:59.667 --> 15:00.933
There are too many loose ends
lying around.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.766
We cannot afford to have her
pull on one

15:02.833 --> 15:03.799
and unravel everything.

15:03.866 --> 15:05.200
You think
I don't realize that?

15:05.267 --> 15:08.766
I think you're in a very
difficult position

15:08.833 --> 15:11.267
and that you have been hoping
the situation with Martha

15:11.333 --> 15:13.033
would resolve itself,
but it hasn't.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.133
You must silence her.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.966
I know.

15:17.033 --> 15:20.567
But I'll handle this myself.

15:20.634 --> 15:23.133
( <i>flips phone shut</i> )

15:23.200 --> 15:25.433
MAN:
Mrs. Logan,

15:25.500 --> 15:27.533
Agent Pierce
was transferred.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.033
That's what you keep saying,
but it doesn't make any sense,

15:30.100 --> 15:31.533
not at 1:00 in the morning.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
We work around the clock, ma'am.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.000
It's quite common
for agents

15:34.066 --> 15:36.667
to get pulled off
details at odd hours.

15:36.734 --> 15:38.899
Right when they're supposed
to have a meeting

15:38.966 --> 15:40.933
with the First Lady
of the United States?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.966
I don't know anything
about a meeting.

15:44.033 --> 15:46.000
Well, I do!

15:46.066 --> 15:47.799
I found Aaron's phone
laying on the ground,

15:47.866 --> 15:49.367
right where we were
supposed to meet.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.300
Now, I want you
to find Agent Pierce,

15:51.367 --> 15:53.899
and I want you to get him
back here, right now!

15:53.966 --> 15:55.467
There's a glitch in
the scheduling software,

15:55.533 --> 15:57.700
I can not pull that
record up right now.

15:57.766 --> 15:59.500
And are these glitches
quite common, as well?

15:59.567 --> 16:00.634
Actually, no, but...

16:00.700 --> 16:02.233
Mrs. Logan.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.433
I'm Agent Adams.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.634
I think I can
explain everything.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.667
Well?

16:06.734 --> 16:08.300
This is a sensitive
issue, ma'am.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.233
President Logan would like you
to come with me.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.433
Ma'am.
What is this
"sensitive" information?

16:24.500 --> 16:25.899
Is it about
Agent Pierce?

16:25.966 --> 16:28.400
I'm sorry-- you need to talk
to the president about that.

16:28.467 --> 16:30.200
I'm asking you.

16:30.267 --> 16:32.166
Do you know
where Aaron Pierce is?

16:32.233 --> 16:33.866
No, ma'am, I don't.

16:33.933 --> 16:36.166
Is this where my husband is?

16:36.233 --> 16:38.899
I want to talk to him.

16:38.966 --> 16:40.799
Charles?

16:53.734 --> 16:56.033
Hello?

17:07.300 --> 17:09.133
( <i>dialing</i> )

17:09.200 --> 17:10.799
( <i>phone ringing</i> )
Yeah.

17:10.866 --> 17:11.965
Henderson wasn't lying.

17:12.032 --> 17:12.933
He doesn't have the recording
on him.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.032
Could it be in his car?

17:14.099 --> 17:15.599
No, he wouldn't
have left it behind.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.666
There must have been
some kind of a hand-off.
What do you mean?

17:17.733 --> 17:19.532
Well, that would
explain why he wasn't
any farther ahead of me.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.300
when I left Van Nuys Airfield.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.267
He must have stopped
and given it to someone.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.965
Okay, I'll back trace the route
with the satellite,

17:26.032 --> 17:27.599
see if I can spot anything.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.166
Yeah.

17:29.233 --> 17:32.000
Jack, we're getting that
recording and exposing Logan.

17:32.066 --> 17:33.467
I don't care
how far I have to go

17:33.533 --> 17:34.634
or what I have to do,

17:34.700 --> 17:36.966
Do you understand, Jack?

17:37.033 --> 17:40.799
Yes.
( <i>phone rings</i> )

17:40.866 --> 17:42.467
Go ahead.

17:42.533 --> 17:44.233
Jack, you were right,
I found the hand-off.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.100
Henderson stopped and
rendezvoused with another car.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.634
I'm sorry
I didn't see it before.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.000
Can you track the other car?

17:49.066 --> 17:50.467
BUCHANAN:
We're tracking
it now, Jack.

17:50.533 --> 17:51.833
It headed back to Van Nuys.

17:51.899 --> 17:54.066
Looks like the civilian
side of the airfield.

17:54.133 --> 17:56.400
Pulled onto the tarmac.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.567
Whoever was in it got out
and got directly onto the plane.

17:58.634 --> 18:00.100
Isn't air traffic
still grounded?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.200
Yeah, this is not
a commercial flight.

18:01.267 --> 18:03.033
I'll find out what I can
about it.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.267
CHLOE:
Jack, the plane is servicing.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.400
It's about to take off.

18:05.467 --> 18:06.500
Has Curtis been relieved
of his duty,

18:06.567 --> 18:07.966
or is he still attached to CTU?

18:08.033 --> 18:10.100
He's at CTU, taking orders
from Homeland Security,

18:10.166 --> 18:11.600
but I think we can
trust him, Jack.

18:11.667 --> 18:12.966
Where is he?

18:13.033 --> 18:14.400
According to the
deployment grid,

18:14.467 --> 18:17.433
he's 25 miles northwest
of you, with a tac team.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.833
Bill, I want you to call him.

18:18.899 --> 18:20.667
Get him to this location as soon
as possible.

18:20.734 --> 18:23.433
I want him to transfer Henderson
and Audrey back to CTU.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.766
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

18:24.833 --> 18:26.033
Logan's in control at CTU.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.533
Curtis will be able
to protect them.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.133
Right now, it's our best
chance to secure Henderson

18:29.200 --> 18:30.866
and get Audrey the medical
attention she needs.

18:30.933 --> 18:32.100
Calling Curtis now, Jack.

18:32.166 --> 18:33.700
Thanks.

18:33.766 --> 18:35.533
What's happening?

18:35.600 --> 18:37.100
The person Henderson
gave the recording to

18:37.166 --> 18:38.899
just boarded a plane
at Van Nuys Airfield.

18:38.966 --> 18:40.467
Why aren't you going now?

18:40.533 --> 18:43.400
I'll go as soon as Curtis
gets here-- he's not far.

18:43.467 --> 18:44.400
Jack, I'll be fine until then.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.500
I'm not leaving you here alone.

18:46.567 --> 18:47.933
Jack, if you don't get
that recording,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.433
my father will have died
for nothing.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.133
Jack...

18:53.200 --> 18:56.233
for me.

19:06.267 --> 19:07.300
Henderson is secure.

19:07.367 --> 19:08.866
When he regains
consciousness,

19:08.933 --> 19:10.367
I don't want you going
anywhere near him.

19:10.433 --> 19:11.667
You don't even talk to him.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.100
You understand me?
I understand.

19:15.133 --> 19:17.933
We have to assume his people
are still looking for him.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.433
They're gonna be monitoring
all non-VPN cell traffic,

19:20.500 --> 19:22.567
which means, you can't make
or receive any calls

19:22.634 --> 19:25.133
unless they come from me.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.766
Here's Wexler's cell.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.166
I've got the number.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.000
All right.

19:30.066 --> 19:31.333
Audrey, I don't feel right
about this.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.500
I'm going to be all right.

19:45.367 --> 19:48.634
I'm so sorry.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.166
Jack, you have to go now.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.899
Jack?

20:00.966 --> 20:02.799
Make sure you get

20:02.866 --> 20:04.766
that recording.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.766
I will.

20:13.934 --> 20:16.468
Let me know as soon
as you're done.

20:16.534 --> 20:17.934
Vladimir Bierko has
regained consciousness.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.834
But we're still waiting
for the medical assessment

20:20.900 --> 20:23.767
to be finished before we can
begin the interrogation.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.733
Let me know when they
give us the go ahead.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.101
Final protocol shifts.

20:27.167 --> 20:29.434
You can tell Washington
the transfer of authority

20:29.501 --> 20:32.234
from CTU to Homeland
is officially complete.

20:32.301 --> 20:34.867
Okay.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.733
Two hours
ahead of schedule, Karen.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.334
That is remarkable.

20:41.401 --> 20:42.468
I'm sorry,

20:42.534 --> 20:43.501
my head is
somewhere else.

20:43.568 --> 20:44.501
Where?

20:44.568 --> 20:45.667
We gave the President

20:45.733 --> 20:47.568
Bauer's location
over an hour ago.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.234
We should have
heard something by now.

20:49.301 --> 20:51.733
The military authority
is handling Bauer.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.167
Yes, I know, but this
doesn't make any sense.

20:54.234 --> 20:56.067
The President insisted
we redirect our focus

20:56.134 --> 20:57.334
from Henderson to Bauer.

20:57.401 --> 20:59.067
We find Bauer, and then
he hands the mission

20:59.134 --> 21:00.067
over to the military.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.101
Karen, we're out of that loop.

21:02.167 --> 21:03.733
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

21:03.800 --> 21:05.134
( <i>beep</i> )

21:05.201 --> 21:06.234
Karen Hayes.

21:06.301 --> 21:07.468
Ma'am, we have a problem.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.334
Chloe O'Brian got
out of holding,

21:09.401 --> 21:11.800
and as far as I can tell,
she's not in the building.

21:11.867 --> 21:13.501
MILES:
Not in the building?
How's that possible?

21:13.568 --> 21:15.067
I'm still gathering
the details.

21:15.134 --> 21:17.000
But I reviewed the surveillance
tape, and it looks like

21:17.067 --> 21:19.501
Shari had a conversation with
her, and Shari let her go.

21:19.568 --> 21:21.534
Shari didn't try
to stop her? Why?

21:21.600 --> 21:22.967
I don't know. She
won't tell me.

21:23.034 --> 21:24.401
I had security take
her into custody.

21:24.468 --> 21:26.201
Good. Bring her up
here right now.

21:30.167 --> 21:33.000
We need to focus on
how we find Chloe now.

21:33.067 --> 21:36.401
My guess is
she'll try to contact Bauer.

21:36.468 --> 21:37.733
I agree, but how?

21:37.800 --> 21:40.600
She was using CTU resources
before to help Bauer.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.267
Maybe she'll try that again.
Which means

21:42.334 --> 21:44.000
she could try to access
our system remotely.

21:44.067 --> 21:45.468
All she needs is a laptop.

21:45.534 --> 21:46.733
That's right.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.167
She'll disguise
her traffic.

21:48.234 --> 21:49.534
Can you get through that?

21:49.600 --> 21:50.767
I can trace
her physical location

21:50.834 --> 21:52.600
by looking at the binaries.
Do it.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.800
HAYES:
Wait outside.

22:01.867 --> 22:03.667
Why did you let Chloe escape?

22:05.700 --> 22:07.334
She intimidated me.

22:07.401 --> 22:08.800
<i>She</i> intimidated you?

22:08.867 --> 22:09.867
Sit down.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.501
You are in a great deal trouble,
Miss Rothenberg.

22:13.568 --> 22:15.767
You had better
start talking

22:15.834 --> 22:17.301
to me now.

22:17.367 --> 22:21.967
She said she'd recommend me
for psychiatric evaluation.

22:22.034 --> 22:24.267
I'd lose my job.

22:24.334 --> 22:26.501
I'm sorry, Miss Hayes.

22:26.568 --> 22:27.667
There's something wrong with me,

22:27.733 --> 22:29.267
I know that.
Shari...

22:29.334 --> 22:31.334
And I should probably
see someone...
Shari!

22:31.401 --> 22:33.800
Did Chloe tell you why she was
helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

22:33.867 --> 22:35.501
She thinks Jack is innocent.

22:35.568 --> 22:37.201
Based on what?

22:37.267 --> 22:39.468
Based on some
absurd idea

22:39.534 --> 22:44.067
that President Logan
framed Bauer.

22:44.134 --> 22:47.134
She even said something about
President Logan being involved

22:47.201 --> 22:48.733
in the assassination
of David Palmer.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.600
I mean, can you believe her?

22:52.434 --> 22:54.234
And people think
I'm crazy.

22:56.301 --> 22:58.401
MARTHA:
Damn it, open
this door!

22:58.468 --> 23:00.267
MARTHA:
I don't know
what you think you're doing,

23:00.334 --> 23:01.501
but you'd better
think again!

23:01.568 --> 23:02.501
Unlock it.

23:02.568 --> 23:03.501
MARTHA:
Open it!

23:03.568 --> 23:05.800
( <i>pounding</i> )

23:05.867 --> 23:07.167
Charles.

23:07.234 --> 23:09.600
I want that man arrested!

23:12.134 --> 23:13.700
And I want know
where Aaron Pierce is.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.900
Shh.

23:14.967 --> 23:16.900
Martha, calm down.

23:16.967 --> 23:18.867
All right?
Aaron's fine.

23:20.434 --> 23:22.934
I just transferred him
back to Washington, that's all.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.067
In the middle of the night?

23:25.134 --> 23:26.234
Doesn't make any sense.

23:26.301 --> 23:27.900
And why am I
locked in this room?

23:27.967 --> 23:29.267
'Cause we need to talk.

23:29.334 --> 23:31.267
About what?

23:41.934 --> 23:43.967
Martha, I've been
wanting to tell you this,

23:44.034 --> 23:45.234
but I told myself

23:45.301 --> 23:47.834
that you were
too fragile to handle it.

23:47.900 --> 23:52.101
But that's not the truth.

23:52.167 --> 23:53.867
The truth is,
I've kept this from you

23:53.934 --> 23:57.401
because it's horrible
and because it's ugly.

23:57.468 --> 23:58.834
What are you talking about?

24:03.334 --> 24:05.401
What happened to David Palmer
wasn't supposed to happen.

24:05.468 --> 24:07.767
He put himself in harm's way,
and he got involved

24:07.834 --> 24:09.167
with something
that he shouldn't have.

24:09.234 --> 24:11.000
What are you saying?

24:14.301 --> 24:16.534
That I never authorized
his death.

24:18.568 --> 24:22.067
You... mean...

24:22.134 --> 24:24.234
you know who killed David?

24:24.301 --> 24:26.633
Yes.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.667
How do you know that?

24:28.733 --> 24:31.434
He works for me.

24:31.501 --> 24:32.633
What?

24:32.700 --> 24:34.134
Martha,
it's very complicated.
What?!

24:34.201 --> 24:35.367
There's an explanation.

24:35.434 --> 24:37.767
What?! An explanation?!
Oh, my God!

24:37.834 --> 24:38.900
Stop!
Go to hell!

24:38.967 --> 24:40.501
Stop! You don't understand!

24:40.568 --> 24:41.967
Oh, my God!

24:42.034 --> 24:44.633
You're involved
in David's murder.

24:44.700 --> 24:45.733
Martha...

24:45.800 --> 24:47.067
Oh, my God,
oh, my God.

24:47.134 --> 24:49.134
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
Why are you
telling me this?

24:49.201 --> 24:51.134
Why are you
telling me this?

24:51.201 --> 24:52.367
Because you're on your way

24:52.434 --> 24:53.934
to finding out
the truth on your own.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.234
( <i>sobbing</i> )

24:55.301 --> 24:57.134
And because you need to stop.

25:00.468 --> 25:01.867
Stop what?
You have to stop

25:01.934 --> 25:03.134
asking questions,
you have to stop

25:03.201 --> 25:04.800
talking about this to everyone.

25:04.867 --> 25:05.800
Never again.

25:05.867 --> 25:07.434
Martha, do you realize

25:07.501 --> 25:09.101
how traumatic this would be
for the country

25:09.167 --> 25:10.834
if people were to find out?

25:10.900 --> 25:13.134
Oh, yes, we're worried
about the country.

25:13.201 --> 25:14.401
Damn it, Martha!

25:14.468 --> 25:16.934
That's the most important
part of this!

25:17.000 --> 25:18.934
This scandal would destroy

25:19.000 --> 25:21.201
the American people's faith
in their government.

25:21.267 --> 25:23.633
It would destroy our credibility

25:23.700 --> 25:25.501
all over the world.

25:25.568 --> 25:27.534
You lied to me.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.867
Everything.

25:29.934 --> 25:33.367
This whole day has
been one giant lie.

25:33.434 --> 25:35.267
What you've done
makes me sick!

25:35.334 --> 25:37.667
Martha, enough!

25:37.733 --> 25:39.167
I know

25:39.234 --> 25:42.534
that what I did, what I allowed
to happen, was a mistake.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.334
It was a terrible mistake.

25:44.401 --> 25:46.234
But it's done.

25:48.301 --> 25:52.401
Right now, I need
you to swear to me

25:52.468 --> 25:55.267
that you will do as I ask...

25:58.267 --> 26:00.434
for the country, Martha.

26:08.667 --> 26:11.667
I've forgiven you
many things, Charles,

26:11.733 --> 26:13.568
but not this.

26:13.633 --> 26:16.234
You've broken my heart.

26:20.067 --> 26:22.067
I'm looking at you...

26:24.067 --> 26:26.301
I hate you.

26:35.800 --> 26:39.600
But I will keep my mouth shut.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.700
Because the people
of this country

26:41.767 --> 26:43.767
don't deserve to suffer.

26:47.267 --> 26:48.401
You do, Charles.

27:10.633 --> 27:14.132
RON:
Are you sure we're going to get
through this the way we planned?

27:14.199 --> 27:15.499
What does that mean?

27:15.566 --> 27:17.533
There's too many loose ends.

27:19.566 --> 27:22.132
What operation
doesn't have loose ends?

27:22.199 --> 27:24.000
Of course we're not
going to get through this

27:24.067 --> 27:25.666
the way we planned.
No one ever does.

27:25.733 --> 27:28.399
I have never made a deal
in my life that didn't feel like

27:28.466 --> 27:30.499
it was going to fall apart
in the 11th hour.

27:30.566 --> 27:31.933
Now, if you don't
have the stomach

27:32.000 --> 27:33.833
to deal with
a few bumps,

27:33.900 --> 27:36.067
then this is not the room
where you belong.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.399
And that goes for all of you.

27:39.466 --> 27:40.933
GRAHAM:
You're starting
to have doubts.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.099
I can smell it,

27:42.166 --> 27:43.833
and I don't like it.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.833
You need to remember
the strength we had

27:45.900 --> 27:48.199
18 months ago
when we started this thing.

27:52.099 --> 27:53.033
We okay, Ron?

27:53.099 --> 27:54.967
Yeah.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.166
Think about your kids.

27:59.232 --> 28:01.266
That's what I do
when I need to get focused.

28:01.333 --> 28:02.600
Yeah?

28:02.666 --> 28:06.366
The situation with Martha
is taken care of.

28:06.433 --> 28:08.299
I spoke to her.

28:08.366 --> 28:09.299
And?

28:09.366 --> 28:11.099
And I made it very clear

28:11.166 --> 28:12.866
that if she continues
with this behavior,

28:12.933 --> 28:15.766
I will send her back
to the hospital in Vermont.

28:15.833 --> 28:18.067
Well, you were going to have
her committed earlier today.

28:18.132 --> 28:20.333
But you changed
your mind?

28:20.399 --> 28:21.933
It's because
she found out the truth.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.967
And I decided
I should keep her close.

28:25.033 --> 28:28.232
What if she finds out
the truth again?

28:28.299 --> 28:30.433
She won't.

28:30.499 --> 28:33.000
And if she does,
I will handle it,

28:33.067 --> 28:35.166
just like I
have all day.

28:35.232 --> 28:36.566
Okay.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.033
Fair enough.

28:38.099 --> 28:40.232
You have done a remarkable job
today, Mr. President.

28:40.299 --> 28:41.633
I will admit that.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.499
Thank you.

28:43.566 --> 28:46.299
It's about time I heard
some words of appreciation.

28:46.366 --> 28:48.299
Oh, listen to me,
we were just talking about

28:48.366 --> 28:50.566
how you've had to be
on the front line through this,

28:50.633 --> 28:52.600
how you've had to get
your hands dirty,

28:52.666 --> 28:57.366
while we could just sit back
and watch from a safe distance.

28:57.433 --> 28:59.733
You've earned our trust.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.232
And I am sure...

29:02.800 --> 29:05.700
that you will do whatever it
takes to keep your wife in line.

29:22.033 --> 29:23.033
Audrey.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.399
Where's Jack?

29:28.433 --> 29:30.433
Audrey.

29:30.499 --> 29:31.600
I'm sorry about your father.

29:31.666 --> 29:34.466
I never intended

29:34.533 --> 29:36.333
your father to get
in the middle of this.

29:36.399 --> 29:39.399
I've known Secretary Heller
a very long time.

29:39.466 --> 29:40.666
He's an honorable man.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.033
What time is it?

29:45.099 --> 29:48.700
It's ten to 12 minutes since...

29:48.766 --> 29:50.700
If those windows didn't collapse

29:50.766 --> 29:51.967
when that car
hit the water,

29:52.033 --> 29:53.800
it could have created an
air pocket or something.

29:53.866 --> 29:56.299
20, 30 minutes in a submerged
car, even at 100 feet,

29:56.366 --> 29:58.600
if there was
an air pocket.
Stop it.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.399
Your father could be alive.
( <i>straining</i> )

30:00.466 --> 30:02.967
Secretary...

30:03.033 --> 30:05.033
Secretary Heller could be
alive inside that car.

30:05.099 --> 30:07.067
If he's alive, you got to do
something about it.

30:07.132 --> 30:08.232
I mean, if there's
a possibility

30:08.299 --> 30:09.900
that he's living,
you got to call

30:09.967 --> 30:11.232
military authority

30:11.299 --> 30:12.733
or the emergency
services or something.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.099
I mean, for God's sake,

30:14.166 --> 30:15.533
he's your father.
Stop it! Stop it!

30:15.600 --> 30:18.199
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop talking!

30:29.766 --> 30:32.366
What, do you think I'm stupid?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.000
You want me
to make that phone call

30:36.067 --> 30:37.666
so that your people can find me.

30:37.733 --> 30:39.466
Audrey, my people
are going to find us anyway.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.099
And Jack's not
going to stop all this.

30:41.166 --> 30:43.199
I'm trying to help your father.

30:43.266 --> 30:44.700
Your father's drowning

30:44.766 --> 30:46.000
in a car, and you're not

30:46.067 --> 30:47.232
doing anything
about it.

30:47.299 --> 30:48.399
You're gonna live with that

30:48.466 --> 30:49.633
the rest of
your life.
Shut up.

30:49.700 --> 30:50.766
He is dying,

30:50.833 --> 30:52.566
and you are doing
nothing, Audrey.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.099
You are doing nothing.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.466
I swear to God,

30:56.533 --> 30:59.299
not another word.

31:17.099 --> 31:18.566
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

31:18.633 --> 31:19.866
Yeah?

31:19.933 --> 31:20.900
Jack.

31:20.967 --> 31:22.266
I've got a visual on the plane.

31:22.333 --> 31:23.733
It must be some kind
of diplomatic flight.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.566
There's a lot of security
on the ground.

31:25.633 --> 31:26.766
We have a problem.

31:26.833 --> 31:27.766
What?

31:27.833 --> 31:29.033
I've been tracking
the helicopter

31:29.099 --> 31:30.132
that Henderson's men used

31:30.199 --> 31:31.833
to shadow
Secretary Heller.
And?

31:31.900 --> 31:33.266
It changed course,

31:33.333 --> 31:35.099
it's heading towards where
Audrey's holding Henderson.

31:35.166 --> 31:36.266
How could they find them?

31:36.333 --> 31:37.533
CHLOE:
I don't know--

31:37.600 --> 31:38.900
maybe they're using
satellite imagery, too.

31:38.967 --> 31:40.733
The point is, they're going
to be there any second.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.232
Where's Curtis?
Based on the speed
of the chopper,

31:43.299 --> 31:45.733
he might not make it there
before Henderson's men, Jack.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.866
Upload your visual to my PDA.

31:47.933 --> 31:50.000
Advise Curtis of the situation,
I'll get back to you.

31:50.067 --> 31:51.633
( <i>speed dialing</i> )

31:51.700 --> 31:59.299
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

31:59.366 --> 32:00.299
Jack?

32:00.366 --> 32:01.566
Audrey,
listen to me.

32:01.633 --> 32:03.466
Henderson's men have
zeroed in on your location,

32:03.533 --> 32:04.566
they're heading
back towards you.

32:04.633 --> 32:06.266
You've got to get
out of there now.

32:06.333 --> 32:07.299
And just leave him?

32:07.366 --> 32:08.766
JACK:
We don't have a choice.

32:08.833 --> 32:09.933
Yes, we do, Jack.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.266
I have the gun
and I can kill him.

32:11.333 --> 32:12.733
Audrey, we need him alive.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.333
Curtis's team is almost there,
they'll track him down

32:14.399 --> 32:15.633
and they will secure him.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.067
You've got to get out of there.

32:17.132 --> 32:18.132
AUDREY:
Jack, he's responsible

32:18.199 --> 32:19.299
for the death of
my father's death.

32:19.366 --> 32:21.000
I can't just leave him here!

32:21.067 --> 32:22.933
JACK:
Audrey, please,
listen to what I'm telling you.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.499
You've got to start moving now.

32:24.566 --> 32:27.000
Audrey!

32:45.199 --> 32:47.033
HENDERSON:
Stipes, get over

32:47.099 --> 32:49.600
and get these handcuffs off me.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.099
( <i>metal clanking</i> )

32:57.166 --> 32:58.232
Heller's daughter's

32:58.299 --> 32:59.700
somewhere in this
building-- kill her.

32:59.766 --> 33:01.800
Then get back here,
we'll deal with Bauer.

33:15.266 --> 33:17.900
( <i>muffled shriek</i> )
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Audrey, it's me.

33:17.967 --> 33:19.299
Stay down.

33:31.933 --> 33:34.033
( <i>gunfire stops</i> )

33:44.866 --> 33:47.033
Secure him for transport
back to CTU.

33:48.766 --> 33:49.433
You okay?

33:49.499 --> 33:51.067
Yeah.

33:51.132 --> 33:53.733
CURTIS:
Hostiles are down
and we have

33:53.800 --> 33:55.333
Henderson in custody.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.733
( <i>sniffling</i> )

( <i>speed dialing</i> )

34:09.800 --> 34:11.766
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )
Yeah?

34:11.833 --> 34:13.632
AUDREY:
It's me.
What's happening?

34:13.699 --> 34:15.033
Curtis's team killed
Henderson's men

34:15.099 --> 34:17.166
and they're taking Henderson
into custody.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.800
Jack, I tried to shoot him,
but I couldn't.

34:22.866 --> 34:24.766
The only thing
that matters is
that you're safe.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.099
I'm fine.

34:26.166 --> 34:27.800
You sure?

34:27.866 --> 34:29.232
Yeah.
Okay, good.

34:29.299 --> 34:30.900
Let me speak to Curtis.

34:30.967 --> 34:32.067
Curtis?

34:32.132 --> 34:33.800
It's Jack.

34:33.866 --> 34:34.866
Go ahead.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.299
Yeah, Jack?

34:39.366 --> 34:41.533
Curtis, I want you to transport
Audrey back to CTU

34:41.600 --> 34:42.466
as quickly as possible.

34:42.533 --> 34:43.933
And get her over to Medical.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.766
And I want you
to tell Karen Hayes

34:45.833 --> 34:47.333
that no one is have access
to Christopher Henderson.

34:47.399 --> 34:48.498
CURTIS:
She'll be taken care of.

34:48.565 --> 34:50.433
But as far as Henderson goes,

34:50.498 --> 34:52.232
CTU is more interested
in apprehending you

34:52.299 --> 34:53.366
than taking your advice.

34:53.433 --> 34:54.800
Just do what you can.

34:54.866 --> 34:56.366
I'll get back to you.

34:56.433 --> 34:57.266
( <i>speed dialing</i> )

34:57.333 --> 34:59.132
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

34:59.199 --> 35:00.033
( <i>speakerphone beeps</i> )

35:00.099 --> 35:01.166
Jack, is Audrey
all right?

35:01.232 --> 35:02.399
JACK:
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

35:02.466 --> 35:03.933
Curtis is in control
of the situation.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.033
Chloe, what have you got
on the plane?

35:06.099 --> 35:07.566
The details
just came in.

35:07.633 --> 35:09.866
You were right, it is
a chartered diplomatic flight,

35:09.933 --> 35:11.033
security-level eight,

35:11.099 --> 35:12.800
scheduled to leave
at 2:00 A.M. or sooner.

35:12.866 --> 35:14.499
Okay, we need
to find out
who's onboard

35:14.566 --> 35:16.000
so we can try
and figure out

35:16.067 --> 35:17.533
who Henderson passed off
the recording to.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.000
I'll try-- it's not
going to be easy

35:19.067 --> 35:20.733
getting past the
State Department's
firewall.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.199
I understand.

35:22.266 --> 35:23.466
Bill, see if you could slow down
the departure of this flight

35:23.533 --> 35:25.067
so I can figure out
a way to get on it.

35:25.132 --> 35:26.099
All right, Jack.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.199
There's a maintenance gate

35:29.266 --> 35:30.700
on the northwest side
of the airfield.

35:30.766 --> 35:32.666
You should be able to get
close to the plane there.

35:32.733 --> 35:33.666
I know, I'm there.

35:33.733 --> 35:34.967
Just get back to me

35:35.033 --> 35:36.866
as soon as you've got
the passenger list.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.000
GUARD:
All clear.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.100
Go ahead.

36:52.233 --> 36:54.000
( <i>grunts softly</i> )

37:03.434 --> 37:04.567
Yeah?

37:04.634 --> 37:06.667
Jack, we've tried
everything we can

37:06.734 --> 37:08.400
there's no way
to delay the plane.

37:08.467 --> 37:10.600
It's taking off in
less than ten minutes.
Okay.

37:10.667 --> 37:12.567
Has Chloe got the
passenger list yet?

37:12.634 --> 37:14.200
I still can't get past
the firewall.

37:14.267 --> 37:15.767
Chloe, I need
that list.

37:15.834 --> 37:16.867
Jack, I'm trying.

37:17.801 --> 37:18.801
( <i>phone snaps shut</i> )

37:30.400 --> 37:31.634
( <i>computer chirps</i> )

37:31.700 --> 37:33.400
( <i>snapping fingers</i> ):
There you are.

37:35.933 --> 37:37.300
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

37:37.367 --> 37:38.300
Yeah?

37:38.367 --> 37:39.434
I got O'Brian.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.300
HAYES:
Did you find her on our system?

37:41.367 --> 37:43.133
Yes, she's using one of
our nodes to try to log-in

37:43.200 --> 37:44.133
to the State Department
network.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.567
Do we know why?

37:45.634 --> 37:47.867
No, but she was using a work
around I'd never seen before.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.634
so I machine-coded a matrix
to get through...

37:49.700 --> 37:51.167
Miles, we just
need to find her.

37:51.233 --> 37:52.100
Where she is?

37:53.700 --> 37:55.400
I'm running a physical trace.

37:59.966 --> 38:01.400
It's a private house.

38:01.467 --> 38:04.133
Cross-referencing
with property records.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.300
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

38:06.367 --> 38:07.966
Karen...

38:08.033 --> 38:10.500
she's working out of
Bill Buchanan's house.

38:10.567 --> 38:12.567
Are you sure?
Positive.

38:12.634 --> 38:15.467
We have a Tac Team
not far away.

38:15.534 --> 38:17.066
I'll dispatch them now.

38:17.133 --> 38:18.734
What's their ETA?

38:18.801 --> 38:21.100
I'm showing less then
seven minutes.

38:21.167 --> 38:22.933
Good, keep me posted.

38:32.133 --> 38:33.467
( <i>speed dialing</i> )

38:35.066 --> 38:36.066
NOVICK:
Novick.

38:36.133 --> 38:37.333
Mike, it's Karen Hayes.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.834
Karen.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.233
How are things going over there?

38:42.300 --> 38:43.867
HAYES:
It's a rough transition

38:43.933 --> 38:45.400
from CTU to Homeland,
but we're getting through it.

38:45.467 --> 38:47.233
NOVICK:
That's good to hear.
What do you need?

38:47.300 --> 38:49.434
I need some
clarification.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.767
We were sent over here

38:50.834 --> 38:52.033
on a directive
from the White House,

38:52.100 --> 38:53.400
but we've been
dealing exclusively

38:53.467 --> 38:56.333
with Vice President Gardner
until about two hours ago.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.066
What happened
two hours ago?

38:58.133 --> 38:59.567
The president called me himself

38:59.634 --> 39:01.267
and ordered me
to arrest Jack Bauer

39:01.333 --> 39:03.600
on evidence he was
unwilling to share with me.

39:03.667 --> 39:06.634
Yes. I know about that.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.901
Have you seen the evidence?

39:08.966 --> 39:10.567
No, actually, I-I haven't.

39:10.634 --> 39:11.400
HAYES:
Mike...

39:11.467 --> 39:13.367
Who has seen it?

39:14.901 --> 39:16.600
I don't have
a good answer for that.

39:16.667 --> 39:19.167
Are you telling me
you're not in the loop?

39:19.233 --> 39:21.367
Actually...

39:21.434 --> 39:24.033
I don't even think
there is a loop.

39:24.100 --> 39:27.367
The president is keeping his
own counsel at the moment.

39:27.434 --> 39:29.333
That's a first.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.933
Yes. It is.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.634
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

39:36.000 --> 39:39.634
Uh, nothing that I can say
with any authority.

39:39.700 --> 39:42.700
All I know is that...

39:42.767 --> 39:44.700
it's been a strange night.

39:44.767 --> 39:45.867
I see.

39:45.933 --> 39:47.667
NOVICK:
I wish I could be more helpful.

39:47.734 --> 39:50.500
No, Mike, actually,
you've been very helpful.

39:50.567 --> 39:51.667
Thank you.

40:17.367 --> 40:18.667
( <i>speakerphone beeps</i> )
Hello?

40:18.734 --> 40:20.167
HAYES:
This is Karen Hayes.

40:20.233 --> 40:21.801
You have less than seven minutes
to get Chloe out of there.

40:21.867 --> 40:23.300
Karen, I don't
know what

40:23.367 --> 40:25.167
you're talking about,
Chloe's not here.
Bill, stop.

40:25.233 --> 40:27.500
Miles traced Chloe
through

40:27.567 --> 40:28.534
a remote node
she's accessing.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.933
And if you don't
believe me,

40:30.000 --> 40:34.534
tell her he used a machine-coded
matrix to find her.

40:40.534 --> 40:41.700
Karen, why are you warning us?

40:41.767 --> 40:45.333
Because I may have made
a mistake earlier.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.567
A lot of things have
not made sense today,

40:47.634 --> 40:50.200
until Shari told me
what Chloe said.

40:50.267 --> 40:53.534
About President Logan
being... involved.

40:55.133 --> 40:56.634
I've got to go.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.367
Just get out of there, now.

40:59.734 --> 41:00.700
Chloe, we have to go.

41:00.767 --> 41:01.667
I can't leave yet.

41:01.734 --> 41:03.100
Jack needs the
passenger list.

41:03.167 --> 41:05.133
Chloe, if they find you here,
you'll be arrested.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.200
You have to go now!

41:06.267 --> 41:08.500
Not yet.

41:56.133 --> 41:58.033
It's the last one!

41:58.100 --> 42:00.467
Let's get this thing
out of here.
