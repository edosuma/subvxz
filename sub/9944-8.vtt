Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:15.660 --> 01:19.209
You can take your skin buffers,
face tonics and exfoliaters

01:19.300 --> 01:20.779
and stick them up your arse.

01:20.860 --> 01:24.250
My Paddy can get me that buckshee.
69 quid a bottle.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.171
Must think I was born yesterday.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.820
Come on, Frank. This is us.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.653
Yeah.

01:39.420 --> 01:42.253
Jesus, Frank, did you take a bath
in Old Spice?

01:42.340 --> 01:45.173
Whatever happened to the days
when public transport

01:45.260 --> 01:49.139
smelt of piss and tobacco?
God Almighty.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.370
(Frank) 'This can't last.

01:54.460 --> 01:58.009
'This fucking misery can't last.

01:58.100 --> 02:02.298
'I must remember that
and try to control meself.

02:07.100 --> 02:12.697
'There'll come a time in the future
when I won't mind about this...

02:12.780 --> 02:16.773
'when I can look back and say,
quite peacefully and cheerfully,

02:16.860 --> 02:19.658
'what a complete tit I was.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.377
'But no,

02:23.460 --> 02:26.975
'I don't want that time to come, ever.

02:27.060 --> 02:32.817
'I want to remember every tortuous,
arse-clenching, soul-bleeding,

02:32.900 --> 02:35.050
'wonderful fucking minute.

02:35.140 --> 02:37.370
'AIways. Till the end of my days.

02:37.460 --> 02:39.212
'You see,

02:39.300 --> 02:42.258
'I've fallen in love.

02:45.980 --> 02:50.258
'And it hurts. Like someone's taken
me bollocks, rolled them in chilli sauce

02:50.340 --> 02:53.889
'and invited them to take up
permanent residence in me gut.'

Oh, my God.

03:12.140 --> 03:14.290
- You must have been up with the lark.
- Haven't been to bed yet.

03:14.380 --> 03:16.052
(Monica) Oh, very thoughtful.

03:16.140 --> 03:19.849
- Er, one more step and it'll be your last.
- (Carl) Bloody hell.

03:19.940 --> 03:21.931
- (Liam) It's like a hotel.
- (lan) I said you should've told 'em.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.294
- (Carl) What?
- Told us what?

03:23.380 --> 03:25.211
Getting ready. We're having guests tomorrow.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.528
What guests?

03:26.620 --> 03:29.612
She's signed up with the church
to have foreign students for the week.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.816
- Foreigners?
- Church?

03:31.900 --> 03:35.017
- 80 quid a week, each one.
- Are we auditioning for the Sound of Music?

03:35.100 --> 03:38.729
Into the living room. Watch out,
the floor's just been mopped.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.733
- Not you, you're otherwise occupied.
- What?

03:45.820 --> 03:48.334
- Your restart course.
- Oh, Deb...

03:48.420 --> 03:50.980
Five days compulsory attendance
or you lose your the dole.

03:51.060 --> 03:53.051
You lose your dole, you're out.

03:53.140 --> 03:56.052
- Yeah, I know, but... it's miles away.
- It's all in here.

03:56.140 --> 03:59.735
Bus pass, packed lunch, pens.
A deal is a deal.

03:59.820 --> 04:04.814
Yeah, yeah, I know...
Never let it be said.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.653
I look like a fucking student.

04:13.740 --> 04:16.129
OK, here are the rules.
You'd better know them by tomorrow.

04:16.220 --> 04:17.494
She's laminated 'em?

04:17.579 --> 04:20.697
(Debbie) You're not now,
nor ever had been, a lesbian.

04:20.779 --> 04:24.455
And you've never been involved in
a gender-fluctuant love triangle.

04:24.540 --> 04:28.215
No wanking in the house or within
a 50-metre exclusion zone.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.211
Your husband works on an oil rig.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.417
You're in the van temporary
till your house is rebuilt after a fire.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.298
No matches, lighters, candles or fireworks.

04:36.380 --> 04:40.089
No discussion of God or lack of.
No politics.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.535
So who are they?

04:42.620 --> 04:45.657
Americans. Irish Catholic descent.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.810
There's a party of 27. We've got two.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.892
So where are these
American Christians gonna sleep?

04:50.980 --> 04:52.732
I'm not giving up my bed.

04:52.820 --> 04:55.015
(Debbie) You don't have to.
lan and Carl are moving out.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.249
Am I fuck!

04:56.340 --> 04:59.332
If this works out, we can host loads.
That's more money.

04:59.420 --> 05:02.298
- I'm crashing at The Jockey.
- Well, you can move out.

05:02.380 --> 05:05.452
This is as much my house as it is yours.

05:08.380 --> 05:11.258
- Why's this money so important?
- Can't tell you.

05:11.340 --> 05:15.174
Fine, your students will need to sleep
on the floor, cos I'm not moving.

05:15.260 --> 05:18.218
You have to.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.656
All right. But you've gotta promise.

05:21.740 --> 05:23.458
It's for a holiday for the family.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.973
What the fuck do we want a holiday for?

05:25.060 --> 05:28.496
Because we've never had a proper one.
Because just for once,

05:28.580 --> 05:31.538
when people ask, I want to say, yes,
we're all booked up for the summer.

05:31.620 --> 05:32.848
Whole family's off to Filey for a week.

05:32.940 --> 05:36.091
- Filey?
- Yes, Filey. It's all we can afford.

05:36.180 --> 05:38.410
Don't tell anyone, though. It's a surprise.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.173
I've already put down a deposit.
This is for the second instalment.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.329
- 15.
- 40.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.456
20. That's my final offer.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.419
It's not going into <i>my</i> pocket, you know.

05:51.860 --> 05:53.293
Shooting pigs in a barrel.

05:54.340 --> 05:57.013
lan, can I crash with you at The Jockey?

05:57.100 --> 06:01.252
Yeah, no problem. You'll have to sleep
in the middle, though.

06:01.340 --> 06:03.058
Nah, you're all right.

06:12.580 --> 06:17.335
What's the fucking rush, love?
Kendo Nagasaki making a comeback or what?

06:18.820 --> 06:21.095
COUGHS

06:21.180 --> 06:22.499
Jesus wept!

06:25.300 --> 06:27.814
CONTINUES COUGHING

06:27.900 --> 06:29.492
Single to Crumpsall, mate.

06:31.260 --> 06:36.015
Fucking hell. The polar ice caps
have got no chance with you.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.056
(Woman) Can I help?

06:38.140 --> 06:40.779
God, I'm like Blunkett
without the dog here.

06:42.380 --> 06:45.338
It's a bit of rust, probably,
spat out from the tank.

06:45.420 --> 06:50.175
God was a boy when they last updated
the bus-stop round here.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.660
Yeah, right.

06:55.740 --> 06:56.934
Keep it.

06:58.420 --> 07:00.411
Thanks.

07:07.940 --> 07:11.615
(Frank) 'And that was
the first time I saw her.

07:11.700 --> 07:16.216
'Eyes that invited you to plunge
the depths of her feminine soul.

07:16.300 --> 07:20.373
'Mouth that promised
more sweet than any wine.

07:20.460 --> 07:23.577
'Should have known then
that something had struck.'

07:39.580 --> 07:41.775
Missed you with the napalm
this morning, did he?

07:41.860 --> 07:44.215
Not for want of trying.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.097
Sit down.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.499
Thanks.

07:51.540 --> 07:52.814
Rosie Buchan.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.653
Frank Gallagher.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.297
'Don't ask me
what we talked about on that journey.

08:02.380 --> 08:03.893
'Nothing of importance.

08:03.980 --> 08:08.019
'The weather, road works,
the fully illustrated graffiti

08:08.100 --> 08:12.013
'on the seat in front telling us
Marie gives free diddy rides.

08:12.100 --> 08:17.333
'Polite trivia, designed to protect
a delicate beginning.'

08:17.540 --> 08:18.529
Hi!

08:18.620 --> 08:21.180
I'm Brandi.
This is my brother, Barney.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.296
He doesn't talk much.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.177
Fuckin' hell!

08:25.260 --> 08:26.739
(Brandi) Is everything all right?

08:26.820 --> 08:31.257
Yeah, everything's fine. Just wasn't expecting
you so early. Excuse his language.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.294
Yeah, sorry.

08:32.380 --> 08:36.895
Shane McGuire. I think your president's
a dick, but I won't hold it against you.

08:36.980 --> 08:42.212
- I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
- I'm very pleased to meet you too, Shane.

08:42.299 --> 08:43.414
Why don't we go inside?

08:52.980 --> 08:54.732
Why are you putting water?

08:54.820 --> 08:57.539
It's from Lourdes.
You can have some of mine.

08:59.100 --> 09:03.252
lan and Carl have moved out
for the week, so it's just Barney and Liam.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.615
- Are you OK sharing, Barn?
- Mmm.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.577
And you're in with me.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.693
I'm not allowed to tell you
God doesn't exist.

09:23.380 --> 09:28.500
It's a chance to have a fresh start
in a safe place.

09:28.580 --> 09:30.650
A new life, a new identity.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.974
Who would I be?

09:33.060 --> 09:37.417
You'll just be the same
only with a different name.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.456
- How would anyone know me?
- They wouldn't.

09:39.540 --> 09:42.452
That's the point
of the witness protection programme.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.768
One of the robbers is on the run

09:43.860 --> 09:46.499
and knows you're the only person
who can identify him.

09:49.460 --> 09:51.769
He will come after you.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.771
I can't leave me girls. I'm responsible.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.930
At least take measures to be incognito.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.375
MOANING AND GROANING

09:58.460 --> 10:01.532
I'll try me best, but you lads
will look after me, won't you?

10:04.460 --> 10:06.769
Aerobics. They're at it all hours.

10:11.620 --> 10:15.169
...Don't cut me off!
I need a chance to win it back.

10:15.260 --> 10:19.617
Benny, listen, please, look, I'm good for it.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.213
You know that.

10:22.380 --> 10:25.929
- Bye, Lillian.
- I'll call you back later. Bye.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.373
Sorry, guys.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.688
Come on, Sarge.

10:28.780 --> 10:32.090
Ma'am! You'll call me Ma'am
when I pass my exams.

10:32.180 --> 10:33.613
Hark at Juliet Bravo!

10:33.700 --> 10:35.895
Shut up! I'm better than her.

10:35.980 --> 10:37.857
(Frank) They say you can't smoke inside,

10:37.940 --> 10:40.898
you go outside, there's a sea of dimps
everywhere, isn't there?

10:40.980 --> 10:44.131
Don't drive your Chelsea tractor
cos it's killing the polar bears.

10:44.220 --> 10:47.610
But will they invest in public transport, eh?

10:47.700 --> 10:49.053
Will they fuck!

10:49.140 --> 10:51.256
40 minutes I'm delayed here.

10:51.340 --> 10:52.819
Frank?

10:52.900 --> 10:53.855
Oh!

10:53.940 --> 10:57.012
Thought I'd grab a cuppa.
Kill a bit of time.

10:59.460 --> 11:03.009
Just when I'm beginning to
take Gordon Brown personally,

11:03.100 --> 11:05.739
silver lining walks through the door.

11:08.340 --> 11:09.978
So...

11:10.060 --> 11:12.255
what's your story, Rosie Buchan?

11:12.340 --> 11:14.615
- Antiques.
- Oh.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.497
Nothing glamorous.

11:16.580 --> 11:18.491
House clearances mainly.

11:18.580 --> 11:21.890
Dead men's dressers.
Widows' wardrobes.

11:21.980 --> 11:26.576
It's the only way to make money
in the antiques game up here. And you?

11:28.060 --> 11:31.769
Well, I'm on a course at the moment.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.095
Professional development.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.814
Don't matter to me what you do.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.936
The job don't make the man.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.295
I've been on the dole so long
they've sent me on a Restart course.

11:50.380 --> 11:54.009
Well, like I say, that's not the man.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.129
Married?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.097
22 years.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.655
Peter, tall and kind.

12:06.740 --> 12:08.856
You'd like him.

12:08.940 --> 12:10.259
And yourself?

12:10.340 --> 12:14.618
Monica. Small and mental,
as far as I can remember.

12:16.140 --> 12:18.893
- (Frank)... You have to, don't you?
- (Rosie) You do.

12:18.980 --> 12:24.850
I feel bonded to the place. I've had
loads of chances to leave Chatsworth

12:24.940 --> 12:26.612
but it's in me blood.

12:26.700 --> 12:31.057
What would I be if I went somewhere else?
Some rootless bloke from nowhere.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.771
So, house clearances.

12:46.860 --> 12:51.012
That's the only way
to make money, you said.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.331
- Is that why you got into it? Antiques.
- Wood.

12:54.420 --> 12:57.856
And I don't mean
like ash or beech or pine.

12:57.940 --> 13:01.694
Though there is a lovely Canadian pine
that oils up as smooth as silk.

13:01.780 --> 13:05.170
(Frank) 'Under normal circumstances,
wood, as a subject,

13:05.260 --> 13:08.570
'would be about as interesting
as life in a Filipino sweatshop.

13:08.660 --> 13:12.892
'But when she spoke about it,
when Rosie spoke,

13:12.980 --> 13:19.419
'I wanted to take a run and jump inside
that round, sweet, cunny-red mouth.'

13:21.660 --> 13:25.255
You look about ten years old
right now, Frank Gallagher!

13:25.340 --> 13:27.012
A-hem! >

13:33.900 --> 13:35.015
...Oh.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.169
This is me.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.376
I had a lovely journey home, Frank.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.451
Yeah, me too.

13:40.540 --> 13:41.814
See you.

13:45.620 --> 13:46.689
Can I see you again?

13:46.780 --> 13:50.534
I've got three days of auctions
this week so I'll be on the same bus.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.815
No, I mean, can I see you again?

13:52.900 --> 13:55.289
You know, just spend time with you.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.058
Please?

13:58.140 --> 14:00.449
The cafe tomorrow. One o'clock?

14:02.340 --> 14:03.853
Great, OK. See ya.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.771
See ya.

14:13.980 --> 14:18.371
'I imagined her going home to her
husband Peter and telling him

14:18.460 --> 14:22.373
'she met a nice bloke on the bus, bought him
a brew and flashed her nipples at him.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.894
'Deliberately or otherwise.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.369
'And then, suddenly,

14:27.460 --> 14:29.496
'I knew she wouldn't.

14:29.580 --> 14:34.973
'I knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
that she wouldn't.

14:35.060 --> 14:36.698
'And at that moment,

14:36.780 --> 14:42.377
'I got a tingling in me testicles
that I hadn't felt since I was a teenager.'

14:46.500 --> 14:47.774
Benny?

14:50.780 --> 14:52.975
This ain't exactly inconspicuous.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.812
In the gents' toilets.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.179
- Benny?
- (Patrick) Is this what it's come to?

15:02.980 --> 15:06.017
Hanging around in piss-soaked men's rooms
consorting with the likes of Benny the bookie?

15:06.100 --> 15:07.089
< That ain't your business.

15:10.780 --> 15:11.849
Where is he?

15:11.940 --> 15:15.615
He's not coming. I'm here in his stead.

15:16.740 --> 15:21.689
I bought up your debt, which,
I suppose, does make it my business.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.133
My arrangement's with Benny.

15:24.660 --> 15:26.139
He considered you a bad risk.

15:26.220 --> 15:29.018
So I took it over.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.694
Paid 30p in a pound for
the five-and-a-half grand you owe,

15:31.780 --> 15:34.897
which by the way,
is six as of tonight.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.612
I haven't got it.

15:40.260 --> 15:42.455
Then don't gamble.

15:42.540 --> 15:45.134
It's a vice.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.609
There are other ways to clear a debt.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.133
Don't touch me!

15:50.860 --> 15:52.418
HE SNORTS

15:56.100 --> 15:58.568
Don't flatter yourself, little girl.

15:58.660 --> 16:01.857
I prefer a little more meat on my bones.

16:02.980 --> 16:06.256
Information, however,
does have a certain value.

16:06.340 --> 16:10.413
- No, I can't get involved with you.
- Then pay up.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.731
- Frank, love?
- Mm?

16:20.820 --> 16:22.970
Is everything all right?

16:23.060 --> 16:24.379
< Yeah, couldn't be better.

16:24.460 --> 16:27.850
Only... you seem a bit... keen.

16:27.940 --> 16:31.615
Well, you know, got to commit
to the course, ain't you?

16:31.700 --> 16:36.137

cut your dole... Fascists.

16:58.420 --> 16:59.933
Yeah, I like it.

17:14.020 --> 17:16.214
I can't eat any of this stuff.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.258
I don't do dairy and I've
got an allergy to gluten.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.808
Didn't seem to bother you yesterday.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.209
You've got a lot of anger, Debbie.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.814
I'm going to pray for you.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.619
Your parents must have
paid a fortune for this.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.452
Shouldn't you go to museums and galleries?

17:31.540 --> 17:33.690
I can look all that stuff up on the net.

17:33.780 --> 17:36.214
And besides, it's not about the money.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.291
At least, for me it's not.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.779
(Debbie) What are you eating?

17:41.860 --> 17:45.455
Custard butty. It's Barney's favourite.
Don't want breakfast.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.178
What have you done to your jeans?
They're brand new.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.296
They were square.

Shane's going to show me
where the Beatles grew up.

17:54.780 --> 17:56.736

- Yeah, in Manchester.

18:09.340 --> 18:11.092
All right, Debs? How's it going?

18:12.180 --> 18:13.977
LOUD CRASH

18:15.380 --> 18:18.292
- What are you doing?
- Couldn't get a bed, could I?

18:18.380 --> 18:20.735
Was that Shane going off with Brandi?

18:20.820 --> 18:22.617
(Shit!)

18:25.660 --> 18:29.494
Don't know what they see in her.
She's a Christian bitch from hell!

18:29.580 --> 18:33.812
Well, it's amazing how far a tiny waist
and long legs will get you in life.

18:50.740 --> 18:54.096
Sorry I'm late. Was waiting on an item.

18:54.180 --> 18:56.535
The bloody auctioneer held it till last.

18:56.620 --> 18:59.771
That's all right.
So long as you got here, you know?

19:02.180 --> 19:07.254
Organic shampoo, soya milk,
goat's cheese, tooth whitener.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.695
Debbie, don't let them take the piss.

19:09.780 --> 19:13.136
I have to make sure they feel at home
otherwise no recommendation.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.098
No recommendation means
I don't get the cash this time

19:16.180 --> 19:17.932
and I don't get repeat visitors next.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.890
- Have you got a douche?
- What the fuck's that?

19:21.980 --> 19:26.019
It's a bottle with a flexible head
for washing out down below.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.818
Like a mouthwash for your fanny.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.492
Where did you come from?

19:29.580 --> 19:31.252
Crept in. Keeping a low profile.

19:32.660 --> 19:35.493
Lillian. Lillian, we saw you.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.697
I've got to get some shopping in.

19:38.780 --> 19:40.611
I'm sure Yvonne will deliver
in the circumstances.

19:40.700 --> 19:45.455
You have to take this seriously,
just till your court appearance.

19:45.540 --> 19:46.973
Might be a problem.

19:47.980 --> 19:50.130
First time I've ever won anything.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.290
You might as well draw
a target on your forehead.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.052
Maybe he doesn't read the paper.

20:02.660 --> 20:06.289

More fool her.

20:12.140 --> 20:16.133

- (Brandi) Let me get this straight.

20:16.220 --> 20:19.815
Your dad has eight kids
with two different women,

20:19.900 --> 20:23.449
though only seven of them are actually his.

20:23.540 --> 20:27.533
Your mom is bisexual, but pregnant.

20:27.620 --> 20:31.693
And you have one brother
with a bastard daughter.

20:31.780 --> 20:33.657
Not to mention the rest.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.095
How did you expect to keep
this a secret from the church?

20:42.060 --> 20:43.379
Don't look so shocked.

20:43.460 --> 20:48.580
If I weighed 300Ibs and had acne,
you wouldn't have told me that stuff.

20:51.220 --> 20:55.577
Debbie, I think you can wave goodbye
to that recommendation.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.660
I never planned for the future.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.571
There didn't seem any point,

21:06.660 --> 21:11.529
the way life sneaks up from behind
and mugs you.

21:11.620 --> 21:14.532
I feel different now.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.736
It's hard to explain it.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.299
Shh.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.211
Something's happening, Frank.

21:24.860 --> 21:27.135
I think it's already happened.

Jesus threw the moneylenders
out of the temple, Debbie.

21:48.180 --> 21:51.934
He doesn't take kindly to people
cashing in on his father's name.

21:52.020 --> 21:55.410
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

21:55.500 --> 21:58.651
Sorry that you did it,
or because you got caught?

21:58.740 --> 22:02.415
It was wrong. To you and Barney.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.899
And to God.

22:03.980 --> 22:08.292
Give me a chance to redeem myself,
to earn forgiveness.

she's taking me for confession later on.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.092
She's been grounded for six months at home

29:31.620 --> 29:33.053
You're sober.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.734
Yeah, well, you're always on the clock,
aren't you? Networking.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.256
On a restart course?

29:52.380 --> 29:54.211
It's a boy, by the way.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.495
Oh, fuck!

30:00.180 --> 30:01.135
A boy? Really?

30:02.420 --> 30:04.376
Or a girl.

30:04.460 --> 30:06.132
I didn't have the scan. >

30:06.620 --> 30:09.498
I waited outside the hospital
for you for 50 minutes.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.491
But when you didn't come
I went inside

30:12.580 --> 30:14.696
and they'd cancelled the appointment!

30:14.780 --> 30:16.532
SHE SOBS

30:16.620 --> 30:18.975
I'm sorry, I just got caught up.

30:19.060 --> 30:21.415
I could have taken Norma.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.491
She's volunteered to be me birth partner

30:23.580 --> 30:27.334
hundreds of times
but I really did think you were interested!

30:27.420 --> 30:28.375
I am.

30:31.700 --> 30:35.978
- Look, we'll reschedule.
- No. They haven't got another slot

30:36.060 --> 30:39.097
until I'm seven-and-a-half months gone.

30:39.180 --> 30:42.138
And they won't do it then!

30:42.220 --> 30:46.896
SHE SOBS LOUDLY

30:47.980 --> 30:50.369
(Frank) 'Dear Monica.

30:50.460 --> 30:54.248
'Dear, spoiled, up-the-duff Monica.

30:54.340 --> 30:58.731
'You're the only one in the world
who could understand.

30:58.820 --> 31:04.497
'As it is, you're the only one
in the world I can never tell.

31:04.580 --> 31:07.936
'I know I'm hurting you,
and I'm sorry.

31:09.540 --> 31:11.417
'But I've got no choice.'

31:14.060 --> 31:15.015
(Norma) Jesus!

31:15.100 --> 31:18.649
So I had the police round, you know?
That nice young one.

31:18.740 --> 31:21.413
Stay in the road!
Look where you're going!

31:21.500 --> 31:24.458
That's enough, that's enough, now stop!

31:24.540 --> 31:26.417
Stop! Stop the car!

31:26.500 --> 31:27.694
THUNK!

31:27.780 --> 31:29.532
- Are you all right, love?
- Fuck!

31:29.620 --> 31:33.579
- Have we finished?
- Oh, Jesus!

31:33.660 --> 31:37.016
Yes, Lillian! Oh...!

31:37.100 --> 31:39.978
We have finished permanently!

31:40.060 --> 31:42.176
Fine, I'll teach meself!

31:53.060 --> 31:54.015
She's coming.

31:57.060 --> 31:59.858
That's settled, then. We'll head out about four.

32:01.780 --> 32:03.532
What's happening at four?

32:03.620 --> 32:07.818
We're going to the... Christian youth group.

32:07.900 --> 32:09.970
Every week on the estate.

32:10.060 --> 32:11.413
Talk about the Bible.

32:13.660 --> 32:16.254
And... do activities.

32:16.340 --> 32:18.137
Christian activities.

32:18.220 --> 32:20.370
Come if you want.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.374
Suit yourself.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.493

32:29.580 --> 32:31.935
Paris? No, no.

32:32.020 --> 32:34.215
I'm sure I will though, one day. Have you?

32:35.660 --> 32:36.979
Frank? >

32:38.060 --> 32:39.095
Hi, Norma.

32:41.180 --> 32:42.772
What you doing?

32:43.900 --> 32:45.538
I'm Norma.

32:45.620 --> 32:47.497
Sorry... Yeah, Norma...

32:47.580 --> 32:49.969
- (Norma) I'm a friend of the family.
- Rosie.

32:51.140 --> 32:53.734
So what you doing here then?

32:53.820 --> 32:57.972
I was just at the hospital
getting me nose sorted.

32:58.060 --> 33:01.097
So how's the course going, Frank?

33:01.180 --> 33:04.217
Great, yeah. Just private reading now.

33:04.300 --> 33:07.098
You don't need to explain to me.
I'm not your keeper.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.454
Yeah, I know, I'm just...

33:11.980 --> 33:13.698
It's very nice to meet you.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.934
Right, yeah, catch you later, Norma.

33:27.540 --> 33:30.691
(Frank) 'It was the beginning of the end.'

33:32.980 --> 33:34.891
Begin.

34:29.659 --> 34:32.811
Been sticking your nose in
where it doesn't belong again?

34:42.699 --> 34:44.850
Frank in late again last night?

34:46.699 --> 34:48.018
Uh-huh.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.217
You're all right about it?

34:53.300 --> 34:54.255
Course I am.

34:54.340 --> 34:56.092
You're not even curious.

34:56.179 --> 34:59.217
No. Norma, I'm not curious,
not even a little bit.

34:59.300 --> 35:02.736
< And I would really prefer it
if you weren't curious, either.

35:06.660 --> 35:08.059
Fair enough.

35:22.540 --> 35:25.293
I love you.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.257
You love me.

35:27.340 --> 35:31.777
The rest is just, you know, stuff.
I won't let this interfere.

35:31.860 --> 35:34.533
We can't pretend
the real world in't there.

35:34.620 --> 35:38.932
Well, who gets to decide
what's real and what isn't?

35:39.020 --> 35:40.339
I want <i>this</i> to be real!

35:40.420 --> 35:45.016
You know, Norma can take Monica back.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.853
Peter's a grown lad,
he'll look after himself.

35:47.940 --> 35:49.339
No, he can't.

35:49.420 --> 35:51.775
Yes, he can, we've got our own life!

35:51.860 --> 35:55.330
Frank, Peter has pre-senile dementia.

35:55.420 --> 35:56.409
What?

35:57.500 --> 35:59.616
He's in a nursing home.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.816
Temporary until...

36:03.780 --> 36:04.929
I can't leave him.

36:06.180 --> 36:08.694
I would never leave him. He needs me.

36:08.780 --> 36:09.895
<i>I need you.</i>

36:09.980 --> 36:14.496
It doesn't mean it's over between us.
We can carry on as we've been doing.

36:14.580 --> 36:17.856
Oh, what, sneaking around?

36:17.940 --> 36:19.896
Hiding on buses, drinking bad tea?

36:19.980 --> 36:24.258
- It's better than nothing.
- Well, I don't think it is, Rosie.

36:28.380 --> 36:30.132
I can't!

36:30.220 --> 36:34.657
All my fucking life,
just scraps from the table, not now!

36:34.740 --> 36:38.096
Not the distance that we've come.
Don't you understand?

36:38.180 --> 36:42.810
I am not the same man
that I was a few days ago!

36:42.900 --> 36:44.697
What are you saying?

36:47.020 --> 36:48.453
I'm...

36:48.540 --> 36:53.978

36:54.060 --> 36:56.654
I'm saying that it's all or nothing.

37:04.380 --> 37:05.654
I can't.

37:11.900 --> 37:15.336
So, what do I do, then?

37:16.900 --> 37:18.299
Nothing.

37:18.740 --> 37:20.617
Oh.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.258
I didn't want to say but...

37:23.980 --> 37:29.259
we've got this chance of a place
in a nursing home down on the south coast.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.570
Oh, fuck! No!

37:31.660 --> 37:35.175
Well, that's where Peter's from,
it's familiar to him.

37:38.140 --> 37:40.096
I think we should take it.

37:48.380 --> 37:53.056

with you tonight, one last time.

she wants to move away.
