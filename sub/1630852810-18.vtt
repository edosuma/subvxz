WEBVTT

00:26.943 --> 00:28.319
Your Majesty.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.946
What's with all these doofuses?

00:30.029 --> 00:32.490
This is the line to see Queen Bean.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.451
Hey, what a coinkydink.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.453
We're here to see Queen Bean, too.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.788
Then you'll have to get in
back of the line.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.499
In the forest, we don't have lines.

00:41.583 --> 00:45.336
Yeah, well, that's what separates us
from the animals… waiting.

00:45.837 --> 00:49.382
- How many people are in line today?
- I'm guessing, a thousand?

00:49.466 --> 00:51.676
Your dedication makes me wanna puke.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.179
Okay, let's solve some more problems.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.181
We should pick up the pace, it's noon.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.767
- Ooh, what's for lunch?
- I don't know. Casserole?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.643
I'm in the mood for egg salad.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.854
I'd like a single noodle, nine feet long.

01:02.937 --> 01:07.400
Ugh. We've already lost so much time
with your little adventures. Can we get on

01:07.484 --> 01:10.361
with the problems of the kingdom
without any more beating around the bush?

01:10.445 --> 01:12.030
Let me ask something, Oddie.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.241
When you get pissed,
do you roll all three eyes?

01:17.368 --> 01:19.662
Quit playing with Odval's eyeballs.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.123
- They have names.
- No, they don't.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.251
Yes, they do.
It's Winky, Blinky, and Soul Taker.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.754
Soul Stealer… Oh.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.131
Elfo, Luci, stop antagonizing Odval.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.299
It's too easy.

01:31.382 --> 01:32.967
Bring in the next whiner.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.469
We're already here.

01:34.552 --> 01:38.306
- Whoa.
- Your Majesty, it is I, King Rulo.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.976
We wee elves
are facing a crisis in Elf Alley.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.480
Conditions are, shall we say,
cramped and we're small.

01:45.563 --> 01:49.734
So, if I say we're cramped…
Ho, ho, boy, it's cramped.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.655
- And?
- Well, we have a modest request.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.739
Go for it.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.157
We want your castle.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.408
- What?
- What?

01:57.492 --> 01:58.409
Wha… What?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.328
Elfo, Luci, conference room, now.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.498
Do you think they know
this castle used to be theirs?

02:03.581 --> 02:06.125
Who cares? Oppression is fun, dummy.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.753
Bean, this is your chance
to do the right thing.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.464
You'll be forever known as the Queen
who gave up Dreamland.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.382
Hmm.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.968
I'm going to say… no.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.514
Oh, you just made a big mistake.

02:19.597 --> 02:22.058
You'll be hearing from Shocko and Fisto.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.769
We're out of here!

02:26.020 --> 02:28.148
The casserole has arrived.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.235
Mop Girl, clean up this mess.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.238
You mean the casserole
or the whole diplomatic situation?

02:39.742 --> 02:41.119
Thank you for waiting!

02:41.202 --> 02:43.746
Your stupidity is most appreciated!

02:44.247 --> 02:45.665
Thank you for waiting!

02:45.748 --> 02:48.251
Your stupidity is most appreciated!

02:48.751 --> 02:49.961
Oh, boy. Here we go.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.462
What is it, Sam Buca?

02:51.546 --> 02:55.258
- Denise left me and she took all the mugs.
- Why'd she do that?

02:55.341 --> 02:57.177
She said you were flirting with me.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.304
- What?
- Just like that.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.014
I never flirted with you.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.515
You're doing it right now.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.892
God, you're annoying.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.853
That's what Denise said
when she walked out the door.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.314
- Bye.
- That's what Denise said.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.774
- What?
- She said she's bi.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.569
- Hey, Sam Buca. How's Denise?
- I don't know.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.863
- How's Oona?
- Eh. Touché.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.240
Beanie, baby, I'm home.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.911
Uh, Dad, I've been on the throne
all morning, and I'm cleaned out.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.662
Can you please take the afternoon shift?

03:24.746 --> 03:26.748
Nah, you don't need me.
You're doin' great.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.043
Listen, there's somebody
I want you to meet. Hey, where'd he go?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.713
Oh. A cute little bear cub.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.549
What do you want me to do, Dad?
Stuff, butcher, or marry it?

03:36.633 --> 03:37.842
None of the above.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.512
He's your half-bear half-brother.
Can't you see the resemblance?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.306
Yeah, I guess I can.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.892
All right, Bear Boy.
Welcome to the family.

03:45.975 --> 03:49.145
Two things you should know about me.
One, I'm a really fun hang.

03:49.228 --> 03:53.358
Two, but I'm busy right now, and I have to
dismiss you. Three, I'm not into labels.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.444
You can choose between callin' me
Queen Bean, big sister Bean

03:56.527 --> 03:58.279
or your sibling Majesty. Any questions?

03:58.905 --> 04:01.115
Are you some kind of giant squirrel?

04:01.199 --> 04:03.576
Okay, take him away, Dad,
before I start to hate him.

04:04.077 --> 04:04.911
Next!

04:10.833 --> 04:12.377
What the hell are you doing?

04:12.460 --> 04:13.878
Oh.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.672
It's called a "bed."

04:15.755 --> 04:17.340
I'm tucking you in.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.344
See, here in Humanville,
we hibernate every night.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.762
That's stupid.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.975
- I miss my mom.
- Oh, me, too.

04:27.058 --> 04:31.729
But this gives us a chance to bond,
and me a chance to be a better dad.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.023
- Finally.
- Pipe down, Derek!

04:34.107 --> 04:36.651
I'm over here
trying to be a better dad.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.031
Hey, where'd you grow up, a cave?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.993
- Apparently not.
- This is my bed.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.913
Shouldn't you be a moth-eating rug
on the floor of a failing cigar lounge?

04:48.997 --> 04:52.125
Shouldn't you be eating flies
in a terrarium?

04:52.208 --> 04:54.794
Eh! Shut your mouths.
I'm trying to get my beauty sleep.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.504
I don't have to listen to a bird.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.756
Don't talk to my pet girlfriend like that.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.341
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

05:00.425 --> 05:02.093
You both need to shut up, yeah?

05:04.137 --> 05:06.264
My name is Derek, by the way.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.183
Not now.
Learn how to read the room, child.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.478
All right, everybody out.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.860
Finally, I'm alone.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.452
Now I can get a good night's sleep.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.628
Bean!

05:37.712 --> 05:39.881
Open this goddamn Dreamdoor right now!

05:39.964 --> 05:41.382
I'm coming!

05:41.466 --> 05:44.260
Hurry up!
Don't make me rattle this doorknob.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.306
- Hello, Bean.

05:48.389 --> 05:51.684
- You know what we want.
- You know what we want.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.395
- You know what we want.
- You know what we want.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.607
And it ain't
your fashion sense.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.400
Get out of my castle, all of you!

06:00.401 --> 06:03.780
This is our castle and you know it.
You get out.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.282
- Jesto.
- Oh, yes!

06:12.955 --> 06:16.000
This is our ocean. Get out!

06:21.381 --> 06:23.049
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:24.133 --> 06:25.635
- Watch it.
- Yeah.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.554
- Mora?
- Bean, wake up.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.768
Oh, you woke up
on the first bucket this time.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.812
Buckets don't solve everything, Bunty.

06:54.872 --> 06:55.706
What?

06:55.790 --> 07:00.002
Pardon me. Sorry. Excuse me. Comin'
through. Hello to you, too. Excuse me.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.212
Sorry about your toes.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.759
Court consultation meeting now.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.302
Ooh! Okay, where should we meet?

07:08.386 --> 07:10.388
Inside your shirt like that other time?

07:10.471 --> 07:12.390
- Behind the throne is fine.
- Aw.

07:14.308 --> 07:18.104
So, I had this dream where everyone
who's out to get me was out to get me.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.107
They were all in the castle,
and the elves tossed me out.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.692
- Elfo…
- What did I do?

07:22.775 --> 07:26.445
Sounds like a typical stress dream,
combined with the paranoid delusions

07:26.529 --> 07:28.364
of a tyrant gone mad with power.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.782
Nice work, you dunce.

07:29.866 --> 07:33.327
- The most disturbing part was the elves.
- Goddamn elves.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.288
Look, I know you're still kinda pissed off

07:35.371 --> 07:38.749
about all the cute little elf skeletons
we found under the castle.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.670
Could you find out what your friends know
about their ancestors in Dreamland?

07:42.753 --> 07:44.005
You mean be your spy?

07:44.088 --> 07:47.049
Betray my own people
for a kingdom of humans

07:47.133 --> 07:50.553
that's shown hostility
to both elves and ogres?

07:51.053 --> 07:53.222
- Do I get a disguise?
- Yes.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.265
Okay.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.272
I'm starving. Where do they keep
the garbage around here?

08:01.355 --> 08:03.900
Wherever you are I guess. Zing!

08:03.983 --> 08:06.903
Nice one, Derek.
Your first attempt at a joke.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.030
Maybe I should just eat your girlfriend.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.199
I'd like to see you try.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.366
Too late.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.701
He didn't swallow, though.

08:13.784 --> 08:17.705
Come on, Derek. Show 'em what
I taught ya about being a right hard man.

08:18.247 --> 08:22.043
- Prepare for an uncoordinated thrashing.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.007
Aw.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.858
What's the deal, Rulo?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.778
Yeah! Did you get our castle back
or die trying?

08:48.861 --> 08:54.158
The next person who asks a stupid question
will feel the wrath of my scepter.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.161
You mean that ball on a stick? Ow!

08:57.787 --> 08:59.372
I'll give it to you straight.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.290
We tried asking politely.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.793
Then we stormed off like angry babies.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.421
Yet Queen Tiabeanie still denied us.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.050
It's time for action.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.511
Action? But we're elves.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.555
What do you have in mind, Leavo?

09:15.638 --> 09:18.808
We'll take it by force.
Though it may cost us many lives.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.184
I have a question.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.687
Why do we want the castle so bad?

09:22.770 --> 09:25.147
You, with the deep voice.
I don't know your name.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.817
You can call me Mustacheo.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.278
Well, Mustacheo, it's not just the castle.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.113
It's what's under the castle.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.614
- You mean the basement?
- No.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.449
- You mean the parking garage?
- No.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.951
You mean the…

09:37.910 --> 09:40.162
It's the very thing…

09:40.246 --> 09:42.582
But it's guarded by
the most hideous creatures

09:42.665 --> 09:45.459
ever to slime their way across a cave…
Trøgs!

09:47.253 --> 09:48.170
Please gasp.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.630
Whoo!

09:49.714 --> 09:52.592
But we don't have to kill everyone, do we?

09:52.675 --> 09:54.593
Bean's heart is in the right place.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.887
- Not like that trader Elfo!
- What?

09:56.971 --> 10:00.391
He's always sneaking around,
poking his nose where he's not wanted.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.893
And his incessant bum-bum talk.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.272
Well, maybe he had a childhood trauma.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.190
What are you, some kind Elfo lover?

10:09.567 --> 10:12.194
- Worse! You're Elfo!

10:12.278 --> 10:14.864
Please don't kill me.
Are you going to kill me?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.282
I have an idea.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.743
Elfo, you'll be our spy.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.871
You'll go down to Trøgtown
masquerading as a hideous Trøg

10:21.954 --> 10:23.414
and find out what they know.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.041
How much is my costume budget?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.709
Nothing. Now, go!

10:26.792 --> 10:28.544
Fine. But you get what you pay for.

10:28.627 --> 10:31.797
You can't even find a good wig
for that price, so suit yourself.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.299
- It's absurd…

10:36.510 --> 10:38.596
Out of the way, bed lights.
I'm coming in.

10:40.681 --> 10:41.641
Ow.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.450
- Who is it?

10:59.950 --> 11:01.786
What's so funny?

11:04.038 --> 11:07.166
- Get out of my castle!
- It's not your castle, dear.

11:16.092 --> 11:16.926
Mom.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.683
Ah.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.477
<i>"How to Stay Calm While Reading in Bed."</i>

11:26.560 --> 11:30.981
"Chapter one. First,
admit you have a problem."

11:31.065 --> 11:32.316
- Dad?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.026
Dad, I've been having nightmares again.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.695
Ah, Bean, I wouldn't worry about it.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.447
You probably had some bad clams.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.533
I didn't even have any good clams.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.535
I got some left over if you want some.

11:43.035 --> 11:43.953
No?

11:44.620 --> 11:48.082
So, these dreams, were they recurring?

11:48.165 --> 11:51.001
- Like the same thing over and over?
- No.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.295
Well, then you've got nothing
to worry about.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.465
If your dreams repeat themselves, Bean,
then you got troubles.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.261
Because that means you got
unresolved issues in the old coconut.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.345
Just go back to bed.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.056
- I don't think I can.
- No?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.683
Well, then I got just the thing.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.601
Try some nighty-night knockout tea.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.103
It's my own special blend.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.906
I gently pummel eight rare spices
into the tea leaves.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.371
Then I have Vip and Vap
sleep on it for eight weeks.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.873
Mmm. I can tell.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.499
I'd put some honey in it,

12:30.583 --> 12:33.335
but ever since Bear Boy came,
we keep running out.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.090
Man, I wanna get to sleep quickly.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.925
Can you chug tea?

12:41.802 --> 12:43.637
Hot!

12:59.695 --> 13:02.031
Ugh! It is a recurring dream.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.535
What do I have to do
to make this stop, kill you?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.632
I gotta destroy that elevator.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.233
Huh?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.110
Ugh!

13:40.736 --> 13:42.613
So gross.

13:43.864 --> 13:44.698
Small.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.368
I just miss the days of, "Hi, I'm Elfo."

13:47.451 --> 13:50.204
It was just a simpler time back then.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.164
What the…

14:00.923 --> 14:03.008
You goin' to the moon rave tonight?

14:03.092 --> 14:05.511
Yeah, but first I gotta shed my skin.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.768
That's beyond disgusting.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.191
Okay, you can do this. Come on. Okay.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.069
Just pretended it's a Fruit Roll-Up.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.989
Oh, it doesn't smell like a Fruit Roll-Up.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.283
Okay, it's on.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.200
Let's go.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.746
Oh. Okay.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.081
I don't hate that.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.749
Look at that bum-bum.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.585
Hello!

14:42.381 --> 14:44.592
Oh. These bad clams ain't bad.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.970
Guys, we gotta get rid of
the elevator to Hell.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.222
The one that cut off my head? Yes!

14:50.306 --> 14:53.142
It's time to give that elevator the shaft.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.811
Catchphrase, copyright,
Luci, the demon.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.982
Oh. Oy! I'm not done with that.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.275
I'll return it, dude.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.569
What you smiling about it?

15:03.652 --> 15:05.738
- It's just going to take longer.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.753
Get ready for an axe-whooping, Mom.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.339
Yes, we escaped from Hell.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.382
Hansel and Gretel?

15:25.466 --> 15:27.926
Oh, no! It's that recurring dream again.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.637
We got to get out of here.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.264
Quick. Press the door close button.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.808
You know the door close button
doesn't do nothing.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.519
You've got to press it again
and again, frantically.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.689
- See?
- It was going to close anyway.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.235
Yes!
We got away from that maniac.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.987
No, we didn't!

15:50.532 --> 15:51.533
Welcome, Bobo.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.202
Welcome, Lobo.

15:53.702 --> 15:54.787
Welcome, Flowbo.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.372
Welcome, Gobo.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.875
Hmm. Stop right there.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.710
I can't remember your name.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.754
Has Sklobo been taken?

16:03.837 --> 16:05.506
- No.
- I'm Sklobo.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.840
Welcome, Sklobo.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.053
Dearly below-ed,

16:11.136 --> 16:14.848
let us bow our heads in remembrance
of those gallant Trøgs

16:14.932 --> 16:18.727
who sacrificed their lives
in our most sacred, secret ceremony.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.855
Sit and spin! Sit and spin!

16:21.939 --> 16:23.148
Hey, there.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.483
Oh, my God. Trixy!

16:24.566 --> 16:27.736
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.781
Oh, yeah, I want to say Splobo?

16:30.864 --> 16:33.951
Well, Splobo,
you're not like the other guys.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.327
You have a personality.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.956
Plus, your hat reminds me of this guy
I used to sleep with.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.417
- Elfo?
- No, Superviso.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.918
What? Trixy!

16:43.002 --> 16:44.795
I thought we had something special.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.589
An intruder!

16:47.673 --> 16:49.883
Seize him or her…

16:53.846 --> 16:57.016
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, it's Elfo!

16:57.099 --> 16:59.351
Aw, my least favorite savior.

16:59.435 --> 17:03.522
Oh, mighty Elfo. You rat bastard snitch.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.691
What are we going to do with you?

17:05.774 --> 17:08.152
- Let's kill him.
- But he's a savior.

17:08.235 --> 17:11.488
Yes, but historically,
we usually kill saviors.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.575
- How should we kill him?
- Roll a big boulder on his head.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.036
Roll several smaller boulders
on his whole body.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.289
No, tie him to a giant boulder
and roll him in a pit.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.876
We agree then.
Something to do with boulders.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.461
Stop saying boulders.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.046
Let's not kill Elfo.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.882
Let's use him as a spy on the humans.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.508
I can't be your spy.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.719
First, Bean sent me to spy on the elves,

17:33.802 --> 17:36.180
and then the elves sent me
to spy on you guys.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.766
Triple crossing is as far as I go.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.225
Enough jibber-jabber.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.685
Let's flatten him!

17:44.646 --> 17:48.150
Okay, fine. I'll do it.
But I warn you, I get caught every time.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.778
Stupid boot!

17:57.701 --> 17:58.577
Hmm.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.961
My hat puff! Are you nuts?

18:08.045 --> 18:11.340
Elfo, don't scare me like that.
Did you find out what the elves are up to?

18:11.423 --> 18:14.426
Well, they're planning something.
Maybe an attack.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.054
I don't know exactly
because I kept getting caught.

18:17.137 --> 18:21.433
But it involves the Trøgs,
who also caught me, incidentally.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.144
The Trøgs? What's their little scheme?

18:24.228 --> 18:27.106
Well, they have a thing for boulders.
I can tell you that much.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.108
Thanks, Elfo. Time for bed.

18:30.859 --> 18:31.860
Think again.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.082
Hmm.

19:40.846 --> 19:41.889
Safety.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.278
Brains!

19:56.778 --> 19:57.946
Brains. That's it!

19:58.030 --> 19:59.740
I've got to use my brains.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.200
Thanks, psychotic dream.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.708
Luci, Mop Girl, listen up.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.169
I know what we need to do.
What is that smell?

20:12.252 --> 20:14.630
It's Luci and his room temperature
clam bucket.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.131
We gotta protect the castle.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.842
Mop Girl, I want you and Luci
to plug up the tunnels.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.427
- How?
- You figure it out.

20:21.678 --> 20:24.264
We did it! What else
can we fill with garbage?

20:24.348 --> 20:26.600
- Elfo's room?
- I like the way you think.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.520
We need something bigger and bolder.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.111
Eh, good enough.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.990
Elfo. Be brave. Go down there and say,
I'm not going to be your spy anymore.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.576
You're not going to back down.
You're cute and delightful.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.037
You got bad taste in women,
but that's true of all great men.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.538
And you're a goddamn ogre.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.165
You're not afraid of anything.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.923
That's the last of 'em.
Let's get drunk.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.467
I have cleaning fluids
that'll make you go blind.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.095
That'll calm the clams
colliding in my colon.

21:03.178 --> 21:05.973
You know something, Mary?
You're too good for this dump.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.558
You're the first person
to call me by my real name.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.144
I'm going to let you in
on my darkest secret.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.480
- I'm nice.
- I know.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.233
My darker secret is
I'm not that good at mopping.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.275
I know.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.613
You know, sometimes I just mop
the same spot for hours,

21:21.697 --> 21:22.864
and no one ever notices.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.367
Hmm? Hmm.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.953
Cloyd? Becky?

21:28.036 --> 21:30.914
- That's right, Luci.
- You're going back to Hell.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.333
Hurry now. Schloop into the bottle.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.961
I gotta warn you, I'm about to spew clams.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.004
Clams?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.885
Thanks. I feel so much better.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.137
Body, over here.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.099
Uh-oh.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.272
Well, well, well.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.983
You've really chosen
the wrong side, Mop Girl.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.401
It's Mary.

22:07.909 --> 22:08.952
We did it, Luci.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.205
Oh, my God. I feel so cleaned out now.
Thank you.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.170
Queen Bean sealin' the whole place up,

22:18.253 --> 22:21.006
like a hundred little corks
in a wedge of Swiss cheese.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.132
She's onto us.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.677
Elfo betrayed us.

22:25.761 --> 22:29.056
Oh, I knew he'd fall
for that big lummox of a queen.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.432
We have no choice.

22:30.515 --> 22:33.226
- We must attack, now!
- Yeah!

22:35.729 --> 22:37.230
Yes, the little stabbers.

22:41.026 --> 22:44.446
Humans may be bigger and stronger
and smarter than us,

22:44.529 --> 22:48.325
but we've got the ability
to run under tables.

22:48.408 --> 22:49.701
It'll be a sneak attack.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.204
We'll go in beneath the castle
and surprise them.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.289
But not in the fun birthday party way.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.541
We head out at the stroke of midnight.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.929
- To the tunnel!
- Yeah!

23:09.679 --> 23:13.683
Oh, Elfo, when are you going
to learn your lesson?

23:13.767 --> 23:16.353
Stay out of other people's business.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.402
Come on now. You two are brothers, okay?

23:23.485 --> 23:26.238
Remember, blood is thicker than water.

23:27.322 --> 23:30.909
Oh, wow. Wait, that's not just
an old wives' tale. It really is thicker.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.412
- Okay, boys. Boys. Boys!

23:33.495 --> 23:36.748
There must be something
you two spoiled brats can agree on.

23:43.755 --> 23:47.300
Wow. I've always wanted to do that,
but never had the arm strength.

23:47.384 --> 23:52.097
If we work together, we could hurt people
much more than we can by ourselves.

23:53.557 --> 23:54.808
Ow!

23:59.187 --> 24:00.021
Huh?

24:12.576 --> 24:16.872
Who is so foolhardy
as to enter Guano junction?

24:17.998 --> 24:20.250
Out of the way, you puny monstrosities!

24:20.333 --> 24:22.669
Hey, we're the same size as you.

24:22.752 --> 24:26.298
So you just turn around
and be on your little way.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.648
This is ridiculous.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.861
If we create some sort of diversion,
we can sneak through that door over there.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.614
Distracto, front and center.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.835
No! Don't go in there.

25:04.503 --> 25:08.215
I mean, unless you want to see
a bunch of old jars.

25:08.298 --> 25:12.928
Who's interested in old jars?
Just grannies, am I right?

25:13.011 --> 25:15.096
- Yeah!
- What he said.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.806
Trøgs can't be trusted.

25:16.890 --> 25:20.018
If they don't want us to go in there,
that's the way to go.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.437
At last, I found it.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.856
No, it's forbidden!

25:26.274 --> 25:28.944
Finally, I've spent my entire adult life,

25:29.027 --> 25:31.821
except for that time in the cult,
searching for this!

25:38.578 --> 25:39.663
Don't drink that.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.540
It's the sacred goo.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.084
- Sacred goo!
- Sacred goo!

25:44.167 --> 25:46.169
I know what it is, you freaks.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.129
It's the very thing.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.965
- No, you fool.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.342
It's not what you want,
it's what you deserve!

25:54.970 --> 25:55.804
Ha!

25:55.887 --> 25:58.265
It tastes like every candy
under the rainbow,

25:58.348 --> 26:00.225
with a horrible metallic aftertaste.

26:00.308 --> 26:03.478
But I expected something
with a little more oomph.

26:05.063 --> 26:05.897
What?

26:06.648 --> 26:07.482
What?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.276
What?
