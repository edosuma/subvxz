00:23.523 --> 00:25.150
Dad? He's gone under!

00:25.233 --> 00:26.526
Somebody help!

00:27.110 --> 00:28.611
I can see you up there.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.029
Is that you, Turbish?

00:30.697 --> 00:31.656
I'll do it.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.117
Farewell, Turbish, you coward!

00:34.951 --> 00:36.411
I'll save you, sire.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.171
Sire?

00:48.256 --> 00:49.090
Sire?

00:52.510 --> 00:53.928
Bean, are you alive?

00:54.012 --> 00:55.513
Move your leg if you're alive.

00:55.597 --> 00:56.639
Ow.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.726
- Ah! A bird's pecking at me.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.688
I'm chiseling as fast as I can.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.276
That decade in the Butterscotch mine
is finally paying off.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.071
What?

01:11.654 --> 01:14.115
- Luci, give me a hand.
- This'll do.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.626
It's stuck.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.419
She ain't getting out of there
anytime soon.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.587
- Uh-oh.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.717
Oh, wait a minute. Why am I falling?
I've got wings.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.430
Let go, you battle toads!
You're too heavy.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.724
No! Either we all survive,
or none of us do.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.267
- That's the deal.
- That's not the deal.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.103
- We made a deal.
- No, we did not.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.270
I'm sure we did.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.980
I signed a prenup secretly.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.774
That says what? We break up?

01:47.857 --> 01:49.275
I don't know. I can't read.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.276
Um, Luci…

01:50.360 --> 01:51.569
- Shut up, Elfo.
- Shut up, Elfo.

02:02.080 --> 02:02.956
Careful, boys.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.791
This is the spot where my dad disappeared.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.252
Don't worry.
We're well beyond the crab zone.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.713
Well, my wish just came true.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.965
What's your wish, Bean?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.803
Very funny, guys. Quit playing around.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.558
What is this place?

03:05.852 --> 03:08.313
Ugh! I hope somewhere with towels.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.943
It's just like that play castle
Dad forced the servants to build

03:14.027 --> 03:17.322
and populate with their own children,
so I could learn to boss people around.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.073
Yeah. Dad?

03:19.657 --> 03:20.658
Luci?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.202
Elfo!

03:24.329 --> 03:25.371
Oh, no!

03:25.455 --> 03:29.167
What have they done to you
my poor, sweet, brave, beautiful Elfo?

03:29.250 --> 03:30.168
Go on.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.669
But keep it quiet.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.548
Oh, my… What did I just say?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.133
Elfo, what the hell happened?

03:37.216 --> 03:40.637
God, you're so bad
at following instructions!

03:41.179 --> 03:42.722
I'm hiding from the enemy.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.224
There's a free pedestal.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.893
Get on it and make like a statue.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.019
I'm not doing that.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.938
And you look ridiculous. Come on.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.606
And lose the chafing dish.

03:53.232 --> 03:54.692
You were nicer
when you thought I was dead.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.278
So, what happened?
What pulled you under water?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.404
I can't remember.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.282
I passed out.
You know, from being so brave.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.370
All right, let's go find Zøg and Luci
'cause this needs a buffer.

04:12.251 --> 04:15.546
Dad? Luci? Dad?

04:15.630 --> 04:17.131
- Luci?
- Luci?

04:17.215 --> 04:18.257
- Luci!
- Luci!

04:18.341 --> 04:21.260
Luci!

04:21.344 --> 04:23.137
- Luci!
- Don't worry, Luci.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.140
You still have your best feature…
your giant schnozzola.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.059
I should kick your ass for that.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.978
- Have you seen Luci?
- You are Luci.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.521
No, my body, dimwit.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.399
It's the lower part that does
the bad things the upper part thinks of.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.775
Eh, there you are.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.652
- Jab. Cross.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.612
- Jab! Hook!
- Ow! Missed me.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.530
- Cross!

04:40.613 --> 04:41.990
Now kick him in the grapes.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.408
They're not that small.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.575
All right, kick him in the plums.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.077
That's better. Thank you.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.120
Ow!

04:47.203 --> 04:48.204
Oh, my grapes.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.414
Okay, that's enough.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.999
I let it go on for too long.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.333
- Ow!

04:52.417 --> 04:54.335
There was a moment where I missed you…

04:54.419 --> 04:56.212
- Mmm.
- …and now we're back.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.011
So, what grabbed you guys?

05:03.094 --> 05:06.681
They were these disgusting little
sea slugs with teeth as sharp as nails,

05:06.764 --> 05:09.934
nails as sharp as claws
and claws as sharp as teeth.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.352
Barely got away with my life.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.354
What about my dad? Where'd they take him?

05:13.438 --> 05:16.482
Ah. Somehow we got separated
when I ran away and didn't look back.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.775
We have to find him.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.486
Really?
What has Zøg done for me lately?

05:20.570 --> 05:21.946
The guy still thinks I'm a cat.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.616
Excuse me, but I'm a demonic agent
of chaos and destruction

05:25.700 --> 05:27.452
who just happens to like belly rubs.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.871
Bean, last time I checked,
you like your belly rubbed.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.247
- Yea or nay?
- Yea.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.667
Okay, I'm doing this one time.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.048
- Don't make me sorry.
- That feels good, man.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.841
- Okay, too far. You went too far.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.426
- Bean, I owe you.
- Okay.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.677
Let's go get my dad.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.139
God… Everything in this place
is so cute and clammy.

05:48.222 --> 05:51.142
Whoa! I think we're in an elf castle.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.311
Why build a castle
at the bottom of the sea?

05:53.394 --> 05:55.646
Yeah, we don't even like taking baths.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.691
Hey, dumbasses, wasn't always underwater.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.777
It was attached to Dreamland Castle.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.906
Oh, no. Dad! They're killing him.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.199
Oh, good. We're too late.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.992
Shall we just save ourselves then?

06:10.161 --> 06:12.205
Inka-binka, tinka-binka. Damn it.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.377
Dad, no!

06:18.127 --> 06:21.005
Back off, you slime bags,
or I'll stomp your guts out.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.883
Bean, what the hell are you doing?

06:23.966 --> 06:25.426
Aren't they tryin' to kill you?

06:25.510 --> 06:28.721
- You screamed.
- Of course I screamed. With glee!

06:28.805 --> 06:33.393
Look! These hideous freaks are sittin'
on a veritable gold mine of jewels

06:33.476 --> 06:34.894
and gold!

06:36.437 --> 06:38.314
Can you believe it? We're rich!

06:38.397 --> 06:39.816
What do you mean, "We're rich"?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.234
Isn't it their stuff?

06:41.317 --> 06:45.321
What she means is what's more important
is that we're rich on the inside.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.242
I can't believe you're that greedy, Elfo.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.578
What you laughing at?

06:52.662 --> 06:54.580
Oh, the rubies are tickling my nipples.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.542
Can we go now?
This one's looking at me funny.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.460
Hello.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.296
Welcome to the home of the sea Trøgs.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.798
I am King Dripo.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.133
Yeah, uh, great.

07:05.216 --> 07:10.555
Anyway, where did you get all this gold
and treasure and baubles and loot?

07:10.638 --> 07:13.641
What is this gold and money you speak of?

07:13.724 --> 07:17.728
All the sparklies here, we find
in the ships that sink from the surface.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.856
It's a gift from the water.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.399
Thanks, water!

07:21.482 --> 07:23.568
- And this castle?
- Is our home.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.445
We moved in ages ago.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.071
Zero percent down.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.573
Well, why did you bring us here?

07:28.656 --> 07:31.367
We thought he was
a delicious walrus to eat.

07:31.450 --> 07:36.289
But then we realized his face was the same
as the gold-face man from the coins.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.332
You're a celebrity down here.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.376
Coin man, coin man.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.253
Clumpy dumpy coin man!

07:44.672 --> 07:49.427
So we invite you as guest of honor
at our special brunch this afternoon.

07:49.510 --> 07:53.681
Oh, um, that's really nice of you,
but we can't stay, we have so much--

07:53.764 --> 07:55.057
Time on our hands.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.767
Of course, we can stay.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.896
It'd be rude of us not to take advantage
of their gullibility.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.732
- Gullibility?
- Gullibility?

08:02.815 --> 08:05.318
I'm so sorry.
My Dad didn't mean to offend you.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.069
Well, that's quite all right.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.739
We don't have thoughts. It's mostly mucus.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.407
Yeah.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.285
Hey, Dripo, uh, since we're hanging out,

08:14.368 --> 08:16.662
eh, how about you
show me around your castle?

08:16.746 --> 08:19.916
Uh, your vaults, the place where you keep
your wheelbarrows?

08:19.999 --> 08:22.001
Okay, but watch your step.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.378
We've got a terrible emerald problem.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.883
Bean, Elfo, you know what to do.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.762
Okay, so you're just gonna
blindly follow my dad's orders?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.598
Bean, I'm well aware of
the moral implications of what I'm doing.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.433
But I'll have plenty of time
to worry about that

08:37.516 --> 08:38.935
when I'm rolling in tickle rubies.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.946
Mmm.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.242
Dad, you gotta quit stealing.

08:54.325 --> 08:57.745
You're embarrassing me
and Dreamland and humanity.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.872
Me? What about Elfo?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.457
He ain't even human.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.252
Ow, my raisins.

09:04.335 --> 09:07.129
Humph. There's no talking to him.
Elfo's gone Elfo.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.131
I'm a noun and a verb.

09:09.715 --> 09:10.550
What's that?

09:10.633 --> 09:15.388
Sea salt, ginger, a hint of lemon juice
over lightly seared my cousin Roger.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.598
You might want to eat around
the venom sac.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.724
Enjoy!

09:19.308 --> 09:22.478
Uh, pass the cousin Roger
and coleslaw, please.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.231
Oh…

09:29.193 --> 09:32.196
Am I seeing things
or did my food just wink at me?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.698
Shh! I'm still alive.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.449
Smuggle me out your large intestine.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.370
Thank you.

09:39.453 --> 09:43.374
You know, this place
reminds me of that old story.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.876
- You remember, Beanie?
- What? No.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.505
Ah! You know… about how we stole
Dreamland from the elves.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.133
It was my favorite bedtime story.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.302
- What the hell?
- Elfo, please.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.804
- What the hell?
- You cuddly fascist!

09:56.887 --> 09:59.557
Hey, I always just figured
it was a fairy tale, you know?

09:59.640 --> 10:02.727
Each daddy king
tells his future kiddy king.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.229
Though I did wonder
why I was sworn to secrecy

10:05.313 --> 10:08.065
and threatened with death
if I ever told any of my friends.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.276
What? I thought we were the heroes.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.861
Turns out we're the bad guys.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.447
After dessert, this means war.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.365
Uh, it was a long time ago.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.200
No hard feelings, huh, Elfo?

10:18.284 --> 10:21.954
I'm gonna stab your eyeballs
out with this mini fork.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.831
To Elfo that's a regular fork.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.541
I respect your death threat.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.419
Now hand me that silver gravy boat,
and let's beat it!

10:28.502 --> 10:29.378
This is crazy.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.965
My whole plan to rule
is about kindness and acceptance

10:33.049 --> 10:35.968
and being regarded as that queen
who's also cool.

10:36.052 --> 10:36.886
Yeah, baby.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.805
Dad, we have to atone
for what our ancestors did.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.975
That means, no taking things
that don't belong to us.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.393
Ah, damn it!

10:44.477 --> 10:46.937
Why'd I have to have a daughter
who can think?

10:47.021 --> 10:48.648
Let's just get out of here, huh?

10:48.731 --> 10:50.441
Oh, you must stay!

10:50.524 --> 10:54.445
The mating ritual
is about to begin. Ha-ha.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.821
Yeah. No, sorry.

10:55.905 --> 11:00.076
Mmm. We ain't so keen on seein'
a bunch of slugs going at it sluggy style.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.287
- That's disgusting.
- No, it is not disgusting. I hope?

11:03.371 --> 11:05.206
These people were here before us.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.166
They shared cousin Robbie with us.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.626
- Uh, it's Roger.
- Right.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.211
We need to respect their culture,

11:10.294 --> 11:13.547
so we're going to sit here
and enjoy this nasty mating ritual.

11:13.631 --> 11:17.968
And maybe after that,
they can come see our mating ritual.

11:18.052 --> 11:22.139
We've got a freaky secret society
I think you might actually really be into.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.017
Oh, no. We could never go above water.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.311
The sun dries us out instantly.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.271
Oh, like this wrinkly cadaver?

11:29.355 --> 11:32.775
That's my third wife, Rashi. But, yes.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.945
Let the spawning begin.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.327
Do it!

11:43.411 --> 11:44.412
Noice.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.958
Here, take this sacred pearl of…

11:55.464 --> 12:01.345
Humans. They swipe our candy,
our castle, and now our jewels.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.557
And then when they're done with us,
they chuck us in the ocean.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.225
That's the human way.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.937
- Dad, no!
- Oh, let him have it, Bean.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.690
Pearls don't go with your
whole tomboy femme thing anyway.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.568
No! Give it back!

12:19.488 --> 12:22.742
Oh, great.
Look what you did. A diplomatic incident.

12:26.078 --> 12:26.996
No!

12:31.000 --> 12:31.834
Damn it.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.005
Yes!

12:37.047 --> 12:38.257
No!

12:39.800 --> 12:40.760
Come on.

12:48.851 --> 12:49.810
What the hell?

12:58.486 --> 12:59.528
Ho!

12:59.612 --> 13:01.906
Striker? What are you doing down here?

13:01.989 --> 13:03.449
Speak up. Are you in there?

13:04.033 --> 13:08.245
Tell Turbish… I… hate him.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.372
- Ho, ho!

13:13.375 --> 13:16.545
Hey, it's Princess What's-Her-Name
of Dreamland!

13:16.629 --> 13:17.463
Sven?

13:18.214 --> 13:19.715
The Viking from Who Cares?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.759
- Hey, girlie.
- Forget it.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.260
You look hot tonight.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.888
Uh-huh. What happened to you guys?

13:25.971 --> 13:29.225
A lot since you dropped us
through that trapdoor.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.810
Right. Oopsie. Sorry.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.145
Of course.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.855
And I don't hold a grudge.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.315
Mostly just larvae.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.942
Ew! Ugh!

13:38.025 --> 13:41.111
Listen, Sven, can you tell me
exactly how this happened

13:41.195 --> 13:43.155
in the least gross way possible?

13:43.239 --> 13:44.365
That's going to be hard.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.534
I got a lot of worms in my throat.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.331
But anyway, we got invited to
the swing and mating ritual.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.707
Mating ritual?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.125
Oh, no! I gotta go.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.170
Do you want me to put you
out of your misery?

13:58.254 --> 13:59.797
No, it's okay.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.006
I like being a dad.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.430
Hi, everyone.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.141
Guys, no time to explain.
Just cover your holes and let's roll.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.476
We can't leave now, Bean.

14:12.560 --> 14:17.147
Don't you want to watch the mating ritual
and give back all the stuff we stole

14:17.231 --> 14:20.776
they so nicely said they won't kill us
for stealing?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.695
We're respecting their culture, Bean.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.531
- Respecting their culture.
- Respecting their culture.

14:33.831 --> 14:37.126
Come on, Bean.
All the cool kids are doing it.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.461
Join us.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.673
I don't need to blink anymore. Join us.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.341
- Join us.
- Oh…

14:44.425 --> 14:45.426
Join us.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.886
Oh, God.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.887
It's not a cult, it's a religion.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.432
- Join us.
- Read our pamphlets.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.689
Stop whimpering, Derek. I see something.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.233
I'm not whimpering, I have scurvy.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.406
What the…

15:09.658 --> 15:12.369
- You'll like it, Bean.
- Things are much better this way.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.830
I used to be all like,
"Do it, do it, do it."

15:14.914 --> 15:16.707
But now I'm like, "Or don't."

15:16.790 --> 15:19.335
Yeah, I had this hang-up about my bum-bum,

15:19.418 --> 15:22.504
but now I'm all, "Whatever, smack
that thing all you want."

15:22.588 --> 15:26.133
Who needs treasure
when you got worms in your ass?

15:26.216 --> 15:28.469
See, dear? It's not so bad.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.929
And we're progressive.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.348
Even females can have slime babies.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.058
What about the people in the basement?

15:34.141 --> 15:36.602
You turned them
into blob-hatching zombies.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.187
You saw Carcass Cavern?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.064
I mean, Human Host Hatchery?

15:40.147 --> 15:42.149
I mean, Sleepy-time Nursery?

15:42.232 --> 15:44.860
Oh, come on, Bean.
It's really not that bad.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.528
It'll be over in a second.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.697
Look, I'll put another one in.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.075
See? Here it goes.

15:51.158 --> 15:54.620
Oh, it tickles.
It tickles so much.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.538
Ah… ah… ah!

16:05.547 --> 16:06.382
See?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.134
It's easy.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.886
Do you want another one?

16:10.969 --> 16:15.516
Um, I like the worms, but I don't like
the way they make me feel.

16:15.599 --> 16:16.934
Turn her head.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.984
- Is rescue, or leave.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.654
- Is, you baby blue goddess.
- Hop on!

16:32.700 --> 16:34.159
Signal.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.538
Elfo!

17:13.991 --> 17:15.284
Argh! Gross.

17:16.285 --> 17:21.123
Uh, guys, I'm a bloodthirsty pirate now,
so I don't care about nothing.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.250
But, uh, where's Bean?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.629
Help. Help!

17:27.713 --> 17:28.964
Shut up, Nadia.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.467
Help me! Anyone!

17:31.550 --> 17:34.511
Oh, God! Actually, Satan! Please!

17:35.179 --> 17:36.055
Daddy…

17:37.514 --> 17:38.474
Mommy!

17:39.224 --> 17:41.393
I'm sorry. I love you…

17:59.244 --> 18:01.246
Open.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.430
Oh, don't worry. Bean always makes it.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.724
Yeah, always.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.188
Damn it.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.356
I gotta go.
