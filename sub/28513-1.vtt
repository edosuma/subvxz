00:06.965 --> 00:09.758
<i>Previously
on AMC's "The Son"...</i>

00:09.802 --> 00:11.427
I'd rather die
than be a slave.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.178
Who blew up my rig?!

00:13.222 --> 00:15.262
Let the people know in your
heart you're a Comanche.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.350
We start killing folks
like the old days,

00:18.394 --> 00:19.434
it's gonna become a habit.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.396
This club is
my hiding place.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.899
I'm not running off
with a married man.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.192
Tar.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.652
And it's a mile
on the wrong side

00:28.696 --> 00:30.070
of my neighbor's fence.

00:30.114 --> 00:31.834
Pedro García
ain't gonna go without a fight.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.198
Get that dynamite ready.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.243
Come on.

02:44.874 --> 02:46.331
This your gringo?

02:46.375 --> 02:47.749
Yep.

03:11.609 --> 03:12.983
Daddy?

03:28.334 --> 03:29.833
It's okay.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.084
It's okay.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.505
Come on.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.382
Come on, Son.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.009
Let's get those chains
off you.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.636
Okay.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.267
Top of the morning, Pete.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.977
I do admire that beard.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.979
Get in the car, Niles.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.814
Sure thing, Colonel.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.382
That's better.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.095
Nice, Jonas. Nice.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.184
Good.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.023
Ah, that bit there.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.526
Did you hear that?
Did you hear the joke?

04:37.569 --> 04:38.986
What?

04:39.029 --> 04:40.654
The joke.

04:40.698 --> 04:43.490
People think Bach
is cold and mathematical,

04:43.534 --> 04:45.450
but here he's having
some fun with us

04:45.494 --> 04:48.620
by weaving in some melodic
quotes from some popular songs.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.330
That, in German,
is called a quodlibet,

04:50.374 --> 04:53.500
which is what
he named this section.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.002
See, this line...

04:56.922 --> 05:01.425
...is from a popular German folk
song called "Kraut und Ruben."

05:01.468 --> 05:02.801
Did you get the joke?

05:02.845 --> 05:04.720
I thought jokes
were supposed to be funny.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.722
Well, to a German,
that is funny.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.141
You sassin' your teacher?

05:09.184 --> 05:11.476
Uh, no. No, no.
He's... He's fine.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.270
Okay, now let's move on
to the Aria.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.563
All right.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.708
Is it him?

07:08.345 --> 07:09.985
Stealing the horse
is out of the question.

07:12.141 --> 07:16.017
Too many damn vaqueros.
I almost just got spotted.

07:19.148 --> 07:23.275
Now, there are some ranch roads
between here and Los Herrera.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.819
If we're lucky,
we... we can...

07:25.863 --> 07:27.863
get picked up on a ride.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.533
I need you to get changed.

07:33.162 --> 07:34.578
We can't stay in this barn.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.038
I'm sorry.
We need to keep moving.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.054
I can't reckon
what's in your mind right now.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.266
But I want... want you
to know one thing.

07:56.310 --> 08:00.395
My daddy's gonna pay
for what he did. I promise you.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.106
I will gut that son of a bitch,
no matter what it takes.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.775
I don't care what happens to me.
I'm gonna kill him.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.068
No, you won't.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.364
What?

08:11.408 --> 08:13.033
You heard me.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.412
You're weak.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.416
Always have been.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.150
Lean your head back.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.947
That's good.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.539
How'd you find me,
anyway?

09:00.582 --> 09:03.750
Oh, spread
enough cash around,

09:03.794 --> 09:07.212
you can unearth
the Lost Ark of the Covenant.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.755
What do the kids think?

09:11.301 --> 09:13.885
Oh, they think
you're a hero.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.595
How's that?

09:15.639 --> 09:18.348
Well, you crossed the border
into Mexico chasing bandits,

09:18.392 --> 09:20.892
and that was the last anyone
ever heard of you.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.146
And what child
doesn't want to believe

09:25.190 --> 09:28.441
their Daddy is a paladin?

09:28.485 --> 09:34.406
You know, there's a lot
to be said for wild country,

09:34.449 --> 09:36.283
country that's not in love
with keeping track

09:36.326 --> 09:39.744
of where a man is
every second of every day.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.290
Used to be like that
in Texas.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.918
You didn't like your life,
you could pick up. Move on.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.296
Be somewhere else.
Be somebody new.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.466
Don't squirm when
I'm talking to you straight.

09:55.887 --> 09:59.723
You have no idea
what you did to this family.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.601
The hole you left.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.936
Nobody grieved.
Nobody moved on.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.273
We all held out hope
that you'd be back.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.483
Four months of waiting.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.194
Four months
of uncertainty.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.865
It was hell,
but we did it.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.492
And you incurred a debt.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.787
If you come back,
you're back for good.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.792
You tore Sally up and you broke
those kids' hearts

10:27.836 --> 10:31.421
and I never want to
see that happen again.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.715
You gotta promise me
you are in this.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.636
And if you can't,

10:37.679 --> 10:41.640
then I'll buy you a horse
and send you on your way,

10:41.683 --> 10:44.768
tell everyone that you died
in the arms of Montezuma.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.397
Jeannie.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.650
Jonas. Charles.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.026
The thought of seeing them

10:53.070 --> 10:54.986
is the only thing
that kept me alive.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.200
I need to hear the words.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.706
I promise.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.510
Glad to have you back,
Son.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.974
You see, that "60 Minutes" piece
proved me right.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.476
You give these people
mountains of money,

12:08.520 --> 12:11.521
and all they do is shake
their swords at each other.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.482
Before us,
they were living in tents.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.485
Now they're shitting
in gold-plated toilets.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.320
I tell you what,

12:19.364 --> 12:22.490
this Hussein moron
is pissing in the face of OPEC

12:22.534 --> 12:24.409
saying quotas don't matter.

12:24.453 --> 12:27.912
Well, that's gonna shave off
a buck a barrel easy,

12:27.956 --> 12:29.038
you watch.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.707
There's gonna be
a war over this.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.169
Maybe not tomorrow,
but it is coming.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.382
Dickie, I gotta run.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.356
Rosa, I swear

12:55.400 --> 12:58.693
you tried to put 85 candles
on that thing, didn't you?

12:58.737 --> 12:59.778
I tried.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.279
It's from Baskin-Robbins.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.447
Oh, my.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.365
We know
it's your favorite.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.910
Oh, bless your hearts.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.620
I'm touched, truly.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.663
Now what to wish for?

13:12.167 --> 13:14.751
Hell, I always
pick the same thing.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.390
Let's open some champagne.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.893
I remember my granddaddy

13:31.937 --> 13:35.897
giving a birthday toast
from these steps.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.107
Oh, 'course,
he was about my age.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.570
I-I don't wanna tell you
how long ago that was.

13:42.614 --> 13:46.324
He has been dead many years now

13:46.368 --> 13:50.411
but I still feel like
he's whispering in my ear.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.914
Usually something profane,
but spot on.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.169
We stay connected to our kin.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.424
Least I think so.

14:05.637 --> 14:10.640
And we stay connected
to places too.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.267
Like this drafty old house.

14:12.310 --> 14:15.603
And the land
that its bones rest upon.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.773
It's all part of me.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.150
Maybe part of you.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.445
Rosa, your grandmamma Inez
cared for this house

14:24.489 --> 14:26.698
when I was just a tadpole.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.658
As did your momma,
and now you.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.494
Now, that is a legacy.
And that means somethin'.

14:34.165 --> 14:38.209
My children have scattered
to the four corners,

14:38.253 --> 14:39.961
pursuing their own lives.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.337
I don't resent that.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.715
But, oh, I do miss 'em
on days like this.

14:43.758 --> 14:47.468
And having y'all around,
it... it makes a difference.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.848
Well, now
I'm just getting maudlin.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.060
To legacy.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.979
It's all you got in the end.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.192
Thank you, ma'am.

15:06.573 --> 15:11.618
I like what you said
about legacy.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.247
Ulises, right?

15:16.291 --> 15:18.499
Yes, ma'am.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.335
Where your people from?

15:20.378 --> 15:22.503
Not too far
across the border.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.714
You ever get home?

15:24.758 --> 15:26.591
No.

15:26.635 --> 15:30.386
Your parents were well-read
I'll bet,

15:30.430 --> 15:32.013
picking that name.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.516
They had a lot of books.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.101
Grandparents too.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.188
You get those hornet nests
cleaned out?

15:40.231 --> 15:41.314
Yes, ma'am.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.694
You expecting me
to tip you?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.988
Uh, no, ma'am.

15:50.825 --> 15:54.702
But there is, um,
one thing.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.788
Out with it, come on.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.706
If you need help
in your stables,

15:58.750 --> 16:00.959
I could be useful.

16:01.002 --> 16:04.295
I been riding rodeos
since I was ten.

16:04.339 --> 16:07.715
Just wanted you to know
that I have other skills.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.510
That's quite a pair of balls
you got there.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.890
I've never punished a man
for that.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.143
I'll talk to Jorge,

16:19.187 --> 16:22.563
see if we can find you
a slot in the stables.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.731
Thank you,
Miss McCullough.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.316
But you only got
one chance.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.610
You mess up
one of my mares,

16:27.654 --> 16:31.447
I'll have you shipped south
tout suite.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.910
I won't let you down.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.838
Now I'll grant you,

18:10.882 --> 18:13.674
Mexican women are not generally
distinguished for beauty,

18:13.718 --> 18:16.844
but I'm partial.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.971
I find
any deficiency of feature

18:19.015 --> 18:23.309
mitigated by their full
and voluptuous figures.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.062
They are some pumpkins,

18:26.106 --> 18:28.397
as the Missourians
like to say...

18:28.441 --> 18:30.483
Mind tellin' me
why Niles Gilbert's here?

18:30.527 --> 18:33.694
I put him on payroll.
He's useful.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.905
He lynched a man
in front of my son.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.825
He really knows
who burned down his bar.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.704
Better to keep our assholes
inside our pants.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.708
Uh-oh.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.336
Carrancistas.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.380
Uh-huh. Reckon so.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.550
Well,
we best get movin'.

19:34.465 --> 19:37.258
I thought you said
this road was clear.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.760
That's what
the comerciante said.

19:39.804 --> 19:40.928
I count nine.

19:40.972 --> 19:43.055
Ten.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.268
Take this.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.769
Pete.

19:48.813 --> 19:49.854
Hey.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.404
W-Where you goin'?
What's he up to?

19:59.782 --> 20:01.824
Hold on to this.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.159
Hola, Capitán.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.580
Me llamo
Peter McCullough.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.123
¿Norteamericano?

20:09.167 --> 20:10.167
Sí, sí, sí.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.960
These men and I, uh,

20:13.004 --> 20:16.297
we're ranchers
from the Rio Grande Valley.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.674
Your men and mine,
we share a common enemy.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.759
Is that right?

20:19.802 --> 20:21.928
The sediciocos.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.532
The bandits...
They come over the border.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.847
They steal our cattle.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.475
We hate them
as much as you do.

20:27.518 --> 20:30.061
We lost them
over in the hills.

20:31.814 --> 20:35.441
Coming here
was a big mistake.

20:37.862 --> 20:43.324
The enemy of my enemy
is not my friend.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.494
ITambién odiamos
los americanos!

20:46.537 --> 20:49.205
Boy's not that bright,
is he?

20:49.249 --> 20:53.209
But... he's the only one
I've got.

20:53.253 --> 20:57.004
Please... don't shoot him.

20:57.048 --> 21:01.008
You'll break
a father's heart.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.551
And...

21:02.595 --> 21:05.554
you'll hurt yourselves.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.181
How is that?

21:07.225 --> 21:10.059
Your Presidente
needs Wilson to recognize him

21:10.103 --> 21:13.729
as the legitimate leader
of Mexico.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.899
Dead Americans
won't help his cause.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.568
Plus...

21:19.612 --> 21:20.695
we'll shoot back.

21:28.788 --> 21:33.874
All I want is to get my people
home in time for Christmas.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.876
Will you let us pass?

21:39.424 --> 21:41.549
Go.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.551
Don't come back.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.011
Merry Christmas.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.846
What the hell
were you thinking?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.242
Whoo!
Here they come!

23:00.380 --> 23:03.339
Go on, Son.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.758
Give your wife a kiss.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.327
Kill the fatted calf!

23:33.371 --> 23:36.705
Our prodigal son
has returned!

23:36.749 --> 23:39.291
I'll take a card.
You're up.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.377
Shoot.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.468
Dammit,
I can't hear anything.

23:49.512 --> 23:51.220
Can we focus
on the game?

23:51.264 --> 23:53.139
I wanna know
what's goin' on.

23:53.182 --> 23:56.142
You're a little snoop
is what's goin' on.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.644
I don't believe Daddy was
in Mexico chasing bandits.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.062
Why not?

24:00.106 --> 24:01.583
Just doesn't sound like
somethin' he'd do.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.315
Hmm.
There's gotta be

24:03.359 --> 24:05.192
some other reason
he got thrown in jail.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.027
He shot
a bunch of Mexicans.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.904
You get thrown in jail
for that, dummy.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.990
A white fella gets caught
killing Mexicans...

24:11.033 --> 24:13.742
In Mexico...

24:13.786 --> 24:15.494
They don't let him out
again, dummy.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.707
C'mon, Charles.
Your move.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.916
Yeah.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.169
The house looks good.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.545
Fixed up.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.922
Gus did the work.
New foreman.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.340
Used to be a bulldogger.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.758
Wow.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.343
Lotta new faces.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.887
Gonna take
some gettin' used to.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.054
Black faces, you mean.

24:34.098 --> 24:35.389
Well...

24:35.433 --> 24:37.933
Most of our Tejano hands
moved on.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.560
Given all that happened.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.896
Don't reckon
I blame 'em.

24:41.939 --> 24:44.690
Let's stop pussy-footin' around.
Where is she?

24:44.734 --> 24:46.025
Where is...?

24:46.068 --> 24:47.985
Do I really
have to say it?

24:49.405 --> 24:53.073
I took her over the border...
To keep her alive,

24:53.117 --> 24:54.617
that's all.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.285
You need to
understand that.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.369
We understand.

24:58.456 --> 24:59.955
Continue.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.249
We parted ways
in Los Herrera.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.252
I ran afoul
of some muchachos,

25:05.296 --> 25:07.588
and soldiers arrested me.

25:07.632 --> 25:09.340
You all know the rest.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.137
Now, Pete,

25:15.181 --> 25:19.433
when you and Miss García
parted ways,

25:19.477 --> 25:23.270
did she mention
where she was headed?

25:23.314 --> 25:24.772
I didn't ask.

25:24.815 --> 25:26.899
I thought it would be
better for her health.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.407
I'm gonna go
see my kids now.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.301
So, I'm fixin' to drive out
to the ole cedar grove

25:54.345 --> 25:56.095
and dig us up
a Christmas tree.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.180
Anyone wanna keep
their old man company?

25:58.224 --> 26:00.140
Yeah, sure, be good to
get out of this house.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.809
I seen some good ones
up at north end.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.477
Great.
Bug? What do you say?

26:03.521 --> 26:04.812
Do I have to?

26:06.023 --> 26:08.607
No. Course not.

26:10.486 --> 26:11.819
I'll stay here then.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.011
Out of curiosity.

26:37.054 --> 26:40.514
That day
at the García house.

26:40.558 --> 26:44.351
Were there any Mexican bandits
there at all?

26:44.395 --> 26:48.147
Or did you just kill
women, children and servants?

26:48.190 --> 26:49.523
You know what happened.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.317
Yeah, I know
the story you fed me.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.193
We took fire.
We retaliated in kind.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.486
Niles Gilbert
was there,

26:54.530 --> 26:56.697
and so was
the Law & Order League.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.575
And you had him
calling the shots.

26:59.619 --> 27:02.244
So, I got a pretty good idea
how it went down.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.164
It's a hard world, Sal.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.374
Bullshit.

27:07.418 --> 27:09.376
The Garcías had oil,

27:09.420 --> 27:12.171
You wanted it,
so you took it.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.549
That's a choice.

27:15.593 --> 27:18.427
Don't blame it
on the world.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.513
You're the one lit a bomb
under this family.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.766
Pete is the way he is
'cause of you.

27:23.809 --> 27:28.187
You selfish,
vicious old man.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.906
Pete's home.

27:38.949 --> 27:42.201
That's a lot
for you to absorb.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.994
I completely understand.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.831
Shit!

28:52.606 --> 28:53.606
Aah!

29:16.130 --> 29:18.005
Tell me English
for this.

29:18.048 --> 29:19.006
"Top hat."

29:19.049 --> 29:22.551
Top hat.

29:22.595 --> 29:24.094
Yeah.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.601
I look good.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.586
Here.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.797
Bring that to your wife.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.050
Maybe she'll like you more.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.843
My wife likes me fine.

30:10.810 --> 30:14.228
Tiehteti.
What is wrong?

30:16.732 --> 30:18.857
This house reminds me
of something.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.345
All right, boys,
put it in the corner over there.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.847
Get your hand under.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.224
Well, that's gonna make
one fine Christmas tree.

30:54.270 --> 30:57.521
Hey, might I borrow your daddy
for a spell?

30:57.565 --> 30:59.356
Why don't you boys
go grab some food.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.400
Sure thing.

31:01.443 --> 31:02.860
Sounds good.

31:07.408 --> 31:08.657
How's Sally?

31:10.119 --> 31:11.679
She hung your clothes
in the guest room.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.245
Well,
she's got every right.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.929
Where are we goin'?
Up to see the Colonel.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.623
He wants to take you
out on a job.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.376
Oh, I...
I ain't ready.

31:23.883 --> 31:27.426
Daddy and I,
we had many conversations

31:27.469 --> 31:30.888
about whether or not
to bring you home,

31:30.931 --> 31:34.057
and I just gotta tell you,
I was...

31:34.101 --> 31:35.934
I was against it.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.981
Well,
what do you expect?

31:41.025 --> 31:43.233
You stood
against our family.

31:45.279 --> 31:48.906
I was on the right side of that
and you know it.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.157
Right.

31:53.704 --> 31:58.040
You see, you're
such a good man, Pete.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.042
You're so decent.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.879
But you're also
unreliable.

32:05.049 --> 32:09.635
And forced to choose
between good and reliable,

32:09.678 --> 32:11.845
I choose reliable
every time

32:11.889 --> 32:13.597
and so do those kids.

32:13.641 --> 32:17.643
Now you may feel all warm
going Christmas tree shopping,

32:17.686 --> 32:19.394
but you weren't here.

32:21.398 --> 32:25.275
You weren't here
to see Jonas cry,

32:25.319 --> 32:27.361
or Charles
beating his chest

32:27.404 --> 32:32.199
just trying to be
the man of house at his age,

32:32.242 --> 32:34.284
or seeing the hardness
growing in Jeannie's eyes.

32:34.328 --> 32:38.163
Your idea of a good man needs
to include being here for them.

32:44.088 --> 32:45.128
I ain't goin' anywhere.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.385
Well, in case
you haven't noticed,

32:51.428 --> 32:54.179
the only way back in
is through him.

32:54.223 --> 32:55.722
So, c'mon.

33:03.399 --> 33:06.274
These are
the surrounding ranches.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.630
We've been buying up the mineral
rights from our neighbors.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.989
The red tracts are
the properties we got so far.

33:12.032 --> 33:13.407
So we're
wildcatters now?

33:13.450 --> 33:15.367
The minute
we hit a gusher,

33:15.411 --> 33:17.869
those leases
will be like printing money.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.622
We'll control all the oil
in South Texas.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.457
I see a lot of red.
How'd y'all pay for it?

33:22.501 --> 33:23.917
Creatively.

33:23.961 --> 33:28.463
The García wells...
Here, here and here...

33:28.507 --> 33:29.923
Are very productive.

33:29.967 --> 33:32.300
García No. 3
in particular.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.677
García No. 3?

33:33.721 --> 33:35.637
I didn't name it.
The surveyor did.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.681
Now, Percy Midkiff.

33:37.725 --> 33:40.892
He has declined to sell me
his mineral rights.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.102
How come?

33:42.146 --> 33:43.562
He thinks
Daddy's a pagan savage.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.605
He has no idea.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.900
Seems this Christ-venerating
neighbor of ours

33:48.944 --> 33:52.404
has designed a plan to
enrich himself at our expense.

33:52.448 --> 33:56.199
Percy has set up his wells
all along here.

33:56.243 --> 33:59.327
He's drilling slantways
to hook my oil.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.205
This act of thievery
ends tonight.

34:02.249 --> 34:03.540
What are you
planning on doing?

34:05.961 --> 34:09.045
Gum up his wells,
break his drill bits.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.547
Once that cement dries,
Percy will be the proud owner

34:11.592 --> 34:13.341
of five
cracked drill assemblies,

34:13.385 --> 34:15.010
which he bought
on credit.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.844
He'll have no choice
but to sell to us.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.058
Why do you want me along?
Why... Why not Phineas?

34:21.101 --> 34:23.643
You and I have been working
at cross-purposes.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.731
We gotta fix that.

35:13.487 --> 35:14.945
Back. That's it.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.780
Keep it comin'.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.198
Right up on the edge here.

35:19.493 --> 35:21.034
Get it in there.

35:21.078 --> 35:22.994
Got four more.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.726
C'mon, boys. Faster.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.603
Bring that second tub
around.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.729
Get it over here.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.076
Gus!

36:03.120 --> 36:05.954
I see headlights!
Someone's comin'!

36:05.998 --> 36:08.748
Get those trucks
back to the ranch!

36:08.792 --> 36:10.792
Pete! Get over here.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.262
Let's get these fellas
on our tails. Come on.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.272
Hyah! Hyah!

36:51.418 --> 36:52.418
Hyah!

37:16.360 --> 37:18.485
Pete!

37:58.986 --> 38:01.278
You think if I give
my top hat to Red Bird,

38:01.321 --> 38:04.072
he'll send his wife
to my tipi?

38:04.116 --> 38:05.865
I like his wife.

38:05.909 --> 38:08.743
I think Red Bird
would punch you.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.203
It'd be worth it,
though.

38:16.920 --> 38:17.877
Oh, shit.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.045
Come on.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.148
Eli.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.359
Eli!

39:22.402 --> 39:23.902
Eli!

39:31.787 --> 39:33.912
Who did this?

39:39.086 --> 39:41.086
Apaches.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.837
They... They...

40:04.986 --> 40:08.029
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.214
Toshaway! Toshaway!

40:30.220 --> 40:31.636
How was Mexico?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.972
Get more horses?
Scalps?

40:34.015 --> 40:36.599
I shouldn't have left.
I should have stayed here.

40:36.643 --> 40:39.227
Shut up.
We needed the horses.

40:39.271 --> 40:42.730
Who knew the Apaches would
grow balls all of a sudden?

40:44.776 --> 40:46.860
They must have been watching.
Mm.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.862
They must have known the
warriors were gone. Yeah.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.739
Sneaky little bastards,
huh?

40:51.783 --> 40:53.491
So, what are we
gonna do?

40:58.665 --> 40:59.747
God!

40:59.791 --> 41:01.749
Why, you...

41:31.655 --> 41:32.864
Aw, geez!

41:33.867 --> 41:34.867
God!

41:37.204 --> 41:38.745
Is Poco Bueno back?

41:38.788 --> 41:41.706
Yeah. Nothing but
a greenstick fracture.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.249
Gus is
patching him up now.

41:43.293 --> 41:44.751
Mm.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.594
Sounds like I missed
quite the little dust up.

41:47.756 --> 41:49.339
I've seen worse.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.049
Did they spot you
at the wells?

41:51.092 --> 41:53.343
Oh, no.
It was too dark.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.386
Could have been anyone
mucking around out there.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.515
But the damage is done.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.230
You did good, boys.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.738
I'm proud of you both.

44:20.784 --> 44:22.367
Get!
