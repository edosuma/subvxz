04:12.361 --> 04:15.087
I can't right now. Baby?

05:15.050 --> 05:18.392
Are you paying

Hello.
Hey.

08:32.951 --> 08:35.556
I'd like to withdraw
$25 from my account.

08:37.186 --> 08:38.756
Big bills.

08:38.792 --> 08:41.287
Yeah, I prefer
big bills too.
Yeah.

08:43.764 --> 08:45.291
Do you have a paper
I could borrow?

08:45.326 --> 08:48.030
Yeah.
Thank God it's Friday.

08:48.065 --> 08:49.735
It's been one of those days.

08:49.770 --> 08:52.232
My neighbor
knocked on my door
at- 00 a.m.

08:52.267 --> 08:57.105
because my Isabel pulled out
one of their trees
for her summer play.

08:57.140 --> 09:00.042
It's been going nonstop.

09:00.077 --> 09:04.079
-Anything for the kids, huh?
-That's right, anything
for the kids.

09:04.114 --> 09:06.950
Okay. Let me get you
your big bills here.

09:08.184 --> 09:10.217
Get you on your way.

09:11.121 --> 09:12.153
You have a good day.

09:33.715 --> 09:35.044
What do you want me to do?

09:36.212 --> 09:37.882
Trigger the alarm.

09:39.380 --> 09:42.018
-The alarm? Really?
-Yes, ma'am.

09:52.129 --> 09:53.293
Right here...

09:53.328 --> 09:55.394
Leave, right now.
What?

09:58.300 --> 09:59.332
Leave.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.710
There's no sirens.
I could press the button--

10:03.745 --> 10:05.140
I need you to call 911.

10:06.275 --> 10:07.406
Right now.

10:08.783 --> 10:09.815
Okay.

10:19.123 --> 10:20.452
Drop what you're doing.

10:20.487 --> 10:23.125
The guy in the gray hoodie
is robbing the bank.

10:24.062 --> 10:25.094
Yeah.

10:26.097 --> 10:29.131
Just go.
Follow Diana.
Jesus.

10:35.337 --> 10:37.172
Do you have 911?
No, because--

10:37.207 --> 10:39.845
You can't get them?
No, because the code
is not working.

10:39.880 --> 10:40.780
I'm dialing...

10:42.245 --> 10:45.048
Sir, we cannot help you
right now. Please leave.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.720
Thank you so much.

10:54.158 --> 10:55.355
Leave now.

10:56.798 --> 10:58.864
The code
is not letting me dial out.

10:58.899 --> 11:00.327
I need you
to move faster, ma'am.
Okay.

11:00.362 --> 11:02.065
Ma'am.

11:08.436 --> 11:10.975
There's a situation.
Everybody, let me just
get your attention.

11:11.010 --> 11:12.339
I-- I can't...

11:12.374 --> 11:14.044
Don't be alarmed.
Don't move too fast.

11:14.079 --> 11:15.716
We're going to
slowly move out...

11:16.114 --> 11:17.344
Okay, uh...

11:19.381 --> 11:21.348
Who--
Who's in charge here?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.418
Who?

11:25.453 --> 11:27.860
Well, she is, but we're both--

11:27.895 --> 11:29.829
I'm-- I'm the manager.

11:30.326 --> 11:31.963
Estel Valerie.

11:33.934 --> 11:35.494
Estel, um--

11:35.529 --> 11:38.332
Okay. Anyone in the back?

11:43.075 --> 11:45.339
-All right, well,
once they leave...

11:45.374 --> 11:49.112
...you lock the front and back
doors, you understand me?
You lock 'em all.

11:52.150 --> 11:53.446
Now go do it.

11:55.318 --> 11:56.922
You heard him, slowly...

11:56.957 --> 11:59.254
I have a customer.
He says he has a bomb.

11:59.289 --> 12:01.124
Is that the operator?
Ye-- Yes.

12:01.159 --> 12:03.225
<i>What's the location of the bank?</i>
-Yes, um--

12:04.393 --> 12:06.932

-Let me talk to them.

12:06.967 --> 12:10.496
He said he's gonna--

12:10.531 --> 12:12.036
No, no, no!

12:13.039 --> 12:14.940
Sorry. Sorry.

12:14.975 --> 12:16.106
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>

12:17.307 --> 12:19.142
I'm sorry, okay.
<i>Hello?</i>

12:22.378 --> 12:24.015
Hello.
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

12:25.447 --> 12:27.150

I have a bomb, and...

12:34.258 --> 12:36.324

I'm going to kill myself
and everybody in here

12:36.359 --> 12:38.293
if my demands are not met.

12:41.595 --> 12:46.499
<i>...going to blow the place</i>
<i>and kill everyone...</i>

12:46.534 --> 12:48.875
<i>Okay, we do have units</i>
<i>on the way out there.</i>

12:48.910 --> 12:50.305
<i>What demands</i>
<i>are you wanting met?</i>

12:50.340 --> 12:52.175
Fraud was committed.

12:52.210 --> 12:54.441
My disability check
was stolen from me,
and I want it back.

12:54.476 --> 12:56.179
<i>Fraud was committed.</i>

12:56.214 --> 12:58.445
Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.888
Can you make sure those doors
are locked and don't allow
anybody in? Thank you.

13:01.923 --> 13:05.056
<i>-Are you having them</i>
<i>lock the doors?</i>
-Uh, yes, ma'am.

13:05.091 --> 13:07.861
<i>And what do you look like?</i>
<i>Are you Black, white, Hispanic?</i>

13:07.896 --> 13:11.590
I'm Black. But I'm not
affiliated with any groups.
It's just me.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.592
<i>Okay.</i>
Yeah.

13:13.627 --> 13:17.332
<i>Okay, my officers are asking</i>
<i>if you let the employees</i>
<i>leave the bank.</i>

13:20.436 --> 13:21.402
<i>Brown?</i>

13:22.911 --> 13:24.042
<i>Brown?</i>
Nah.

13:25.145 --> 13:28.409
I-- I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.

13:28.444 --> 13:31.610
As long
as everybody stays calm,
nobody gets hurt, okay?

13:31.645 --> 13:35.889
I promise I-I won't hurt nobody,
but I can't let them go. Sorry.

13:35.924 --> 13:38.155

the bomb, okay? Okay?
<i>-Okay.</i>

13:40.995 --> 13:43.996
Ma'am, I need to
speak to somebody,
a negotiator or someone.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.998
I'm running out of time.
I just...

13:46.033 --> 13:47.527
<i>I do have someone</i>
<i>on the way out there</i>
<i>to meet with you.</i>

13:47.562 --> 13:49.364
Okay.

Uh, the bank.

13:51.005 --> 13:52.939
<i>What is their number,</i>
<i>can you ask them?</i>

13:52.974 --> 13:54.666
<i>Confirm I have the right one.</i>
She doesn't have
the bank number.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.536
She asking
for the bank number.

13:56.571 --> 13:59.374
-She could call the landline.
One, eight--
<i>-I could find it.</i>

13:59.409 --> 14:03.081
<i>Brown, what kind of clothing</i>
<i>are you w-- wearing?</i>

14:15.458 --> 14:17.095
Why are you asking me that?

14:20.232 --> 14:23.299
What kind of clothes... Why?

14:23.334 --> 14:25.400
But why are you asking me that?

14:29.241 --> 14:31.439
Why did you
just ask me that question?

14:32.343 --> 14:33.672
You got the sniper on me?

14:40.384 --> 14:43.022
You got the sniper on me?

14:43.057 --> 14:45.090
<i>I'm not sure if there are</i>
<i>any officers on scene yet,</i>
<i>but they're requesting</i>

14:45.125 --> 14:47.422
<i>to know what clothing</i>
<i>you are wearing.</i>
You got the sniper on me.

14:47.457 --> 14:50.194
That's why you asking
that question, 'cause you got
a sniper on me right now.

14:50.229 --> 14:51.492
You want to kill me.

15:39.641 --> 15:42.345
You cannot go out like that.

on you, I promise you that.

20:04.873 --> 20:05.705
Okay?

20:07.480 --> 20:09.480
Why don't you

Uh, what do you like?

20:13.453 --> 20:14.650
Go to the club?

20:16.324 --> 20:17.785
I like Jean Grey.

20:19.789 --> 20:22.020
That's random.

20:23.397 --> 20:24.561
That's really random.

20:30.965 --> 20:32.635
You ever
been robbed before?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.869
Yes. Once.

20:35.904 --> 20:38.641
How'd it end?
What's your name again?

-They didn't kill him?
-Mm-mmm. No, sir.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.492
He got to be white.

20:57.926 --> 21:00.333
Estel, can you get on the phone
with the network?

21:00.368 --> 21:03.732
But call 911 first.
This woman on the phone,
she is no help.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.602
-I gotta go to my desk for that.
-Okay.

21:05.637 --> 21:07.769
That's fine, and shut
those doors again, okay.

21:07.804 --> 21:09.639
They come in here,
they gonna shoot everybody up.

21:09.674 --> 21:11.608
-Spray and pray.
That's how they do.
-Okay.

21:11.643 --> 21:14.644
-I-- I did-- I-I locked it
when you first asked me to.
-When? When?

21:14.679 --> 21:16.811
When you first asked me to.

21:18.881 --> 21:21.981
Okay. Okay. It's all right.
Forgive me.

21:23.424 --> 21:24.456
Okay.

21:26.559 --> 21:29.021
Is there another dial-out number
I could use here?

21:29.056 --> 21:31.925
I need to contact my people,
make sure they know
what's happening, you know?

21:31.960 --> 21:34.565
Don't want to have
everybody worried.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.567
-You could use
that one over there.
-Yeah?

21:36.602 --> 21:38.932
Yeah.
I'm going to leave here.
Don't want you to do anything.

21:38.967 --> 21:41.473
I'm just going
to move over there,
take a call, okay?

21:42.641 --> 21:45.136
I'm here
at the Windy Hills Wells Fargo,

21:45.171 --> 21:47.446
and there's a man
holding up the bank.

21:49.714 --> 21:51.351
The code is nine.

21:52.112 --> 21:53.947
There is a man holding us up.

21:59.460 --> 22:02.153
<i>Hi, this is Cassandra Deets.</i>
<i>Drop what you're gonna ask</i>
<i>at the beep.</i>

22:02.188 --> 22:04.155
Come on, baby.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.695
We could use some help.

22:10.504 --> 22:11.635
Ma'am, are you there?

22:14.607 --> 22:18.004
<i>Hi, this is Cassandra Deets.</i>
<i>Drop what you're gonna ask</i>
<i>at the beep.</i>

22:25.519 --> 22:27.046
Hello?
<i>Hey there.</i>

22:27.081 --> 22:29.587
<i>Is this the Windy Hills</i>
<i>Wells Fargo?</i>

22:31.987 --> 22:35.021
Uh, yes, ma'am.
This is the Wells Fargo.

22:35.056 --> 22:37.958
<i>Uh, yeah,</i>
<i>I need to talk to Bridget</i>
<i>about my 401.</i>

22:37.993 --> 22:40.532
<i>I think she made</i>
<i>a $9,000 mistake.</i>

22:40.567 --> 22:43.832
Unfortunately, uh,
Bridget is not here
to discuss your 401,

22:43.867 --> 22:45.900
but can I take
a message for you?
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:46.936 --> 22:48.441
You been having a good day?

22:48.476 --> 22:49.574
<i>Uh, could be better.</i>

22:50.236 --> 22:51.939
Sorry to hear that, ma'am.

22:53.173 --> 22:54.414
Okay, shoot.

22:54.977 --> 23:00.112
<i>816-935-6105.</i>

23:00.147 --> 23:02.719
<i>Just have her</i>
<i>call me back right away.</i>
Thank you, ma'am.

23:07.022 --> 23:09.154
That's for Bridget.
She gonna need that.

23:13.864 --> 23:15.160
<i>Where are you located at?</i>

23:15.195 --> 23:16.997
I am near the front door.

23:17.032 --> 23:18.735
<i>Okay, just stay on the line</i>
<i>with me.</i>

23:18.770 --> 23:20.605
They got fire?
I don't know.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.003
-He wants fire trucks.
-What do you mean
you don't know?

23:26.547 --> 23:30.549
<i>Our fire trucks will not pull up</i>
<i>on scene if there is a bomb.</i>

23:33.114 --> 23:34.652
I'm sorry.

23:36.051 --> 23:38.590
How much money
do you need, sir?

23:41.122 --> 23:44.222
I can get it for you.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.664
It's sitting
right up there.

23:46.699 --> 23:50.734
<i> You have</i>
<i>reached the voice mailbox of...</i>
<i> Kiah.</i>

23:57.006 --> 23:58.775
I don't want
the bank's money.

24:02.077 --> 24:04.110
I just want the cash...

24:06.213 --> 24:07.883
that those people took from me.

24:07.918 --> 24:09.687
That's all I want.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.826
Okay. Okay, it's okay!
It's okay. I got it, I got it,
I got it!

24:16.861 --> 24:18.993
Go! Go! Go!

24:19.028 --> 24:22.293
What happening? Who's shooting?

24:22.328 --> 24:24.031
It is an employee!

24:24.066 --> 24:26.000
It's all clear.
<i> Hello?</i>

24:26.035 --> 24:27.870
He's gone.
<i>Estel, do you need me?</i>

24:30.578 --> 24:32.270
<i>Are you okay in there?</i>
Sorry.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.876
I'm sorry.

24:33.911 --> 24:35.944
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:35.979 --> 24:39.651
It's just a reflex. I'm sorry.
<i>You still have a visual on him?</i>

24:39.686 --> 24:42.082
No. No.
I'm sorry, okay.
I apologize.

24:42.117 --> 24:46.691
Ma'am, I apologize, okay?
I did not mean to do that.

24:46.726 --> 24:48.759
How come y'all letting people
walk up to the entrance?

24:48.794 --> 24:50.794
It seems like y'all
could do better than that.

24:52.864 --> 24:54.765
You gotta get us out of here.

25:11.916 --> 25:13.850
Hello?
<i>Yes, I'm here.</i>

25:13.885 --> 25:17.051
I still don't have
a damn negotiator,
and I'm wondering why.

25:17.086 --> 25:18.151
Where's my negotiator?

25:19.253 --> 25:20.791
Hello?

25:20.826 --> 25:22.221
<i>All right,</i>
<i>hang on just a second.</i>

25:23.730 --> 25:24.762
Hello?

25:31.738 --> 25:35.234
Sir, we can really help you.
Please, um-- Please don't!

25:36.204 --> 25:37.907
No, don't...

25:39.240 --> 25:41.372
I had a button made, okay.

25:41.407 --> 25:42.747
You see this?

25:44.047 --> 25:47.015
We got kids.
Please don't, sir.

25:47.050 --> 25:50.623
I need my negotiator. Somebody--
Somebody to come down and talk!

25:50.658 --> 25:52.383
To talk! That's all!

25:52.418 --> 25:55.320
Where's my negotiator?
Please, ma'am, just...

25:55.355 --> 25:58.862
<i>Sir. Just hold onto the phone</i>
<i>right here...</i>

25:58.897 --> 26:00.798
I've been holding on.
I've been holding on though.

26:00.833 --> 26:03.130
I've been holding on though.
I held on.

26:07.103 --> 26:09.972
<i>If we get disconnected,</i>
<i>I'll call you right back, okay?</i>

26:12.042 --> 26:12.874
<i>Okay?</i>

26:14.242 --> 26:16.308
You gonna have
my negotiator ready for me?

26:17.047 --> 26:19.080
Ma'am?

26:19.115 --> 26:21.115
<i>Yes, sir, you just</i>
<i>hold onto the line.</i>
Okay.

26:21.150 --> 26:23.150
<i>I'll get him on.</i>
Okay.

26:37.199 --> 26:39.298
I'm sorry, y'all,
I had to do that.

26:48.914 --> 26:50.881
Any of y'all ladies
need the restroom?

26:57.725 --> 27:00.660
-I could do to use the restroom.
-All right, go on then.

27:19.076 --> 27:20.108
You okay?

27:48.941 --> 27:51.370
Hello? Okay.
<i>I have Major Riddick</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

27:51.405 --> 27:52.976
Okay.

27:53.011 --> 27:54.813
Check on Estel
in the bathroom, okay.

27:54.848 --> 27:56.276
Make sure she good, aight?

28:02.955 --> 28:04.790
<i>You there, sir?</i>
Uh, yes, I am.

28:06.354 --> 28:08.255
<i>Hello, Mr. Easley.</i>
<i>My name is Major Riddick.</i>

28:08.290 --> 28:10.191
<i>Now you tell us</i>
<i>what's going on in there, okay?</i>

28:10.226 --> 28:12.061
-The Department
of Veterans Affairs...
-Estel?

28:12.899 --> 28:13.931
Estel.

28:16.133 --> 28:19.035
They left me destitute
and homeless and, uh--

28:19.070 --> 28:22.269
I'm-- I'm going to
be on the streets.
So I need your assistance, sir.

28:22.304 --> 28:25.041
<i>All right.</i>
<i>What can we do to help you out?</i>

28:25.076 --> 28:27.241
Well, pay me my money.

28:27.276 --> 28:30.211
That's the whole reason why we
having this conversation, sir.

28:30.246 --> 28:32.785
<i>All right, how much--</i>
<i>how much is that exactly?</i>

28:36.318 --> 28:39.220
Estel, I think we're gonna be
on the TV. Turn it on.

28:39.255 --> 28:41.893
We're gonna be on
one of the channels.
Sorry about that.

28:41.928 --> 28:45.457
<i>Well, would you be willing</i>
<i>to come outside and talk--</i>
<i>talk to us about that?</i>

28:46.493 --> 28:48.427
Sir, I'm not coming outside.

28:48.462 --> 28:50.803
<i>All right,</i>
<i>what are your intentions</i>
<i>right now?</i>

28:52.906 --> 28:54.037
Well, uh,

28:55.373 --> 28:58.272
my intentions are
to blow up this place
if my demands aren't met.

28:58.307 --> 29:02.078
I told y'all before.
I don't know why I have to
repeat myself, but okay.

29:02.113 --> 29:05.147
Uh, you know, I'm serious, sir.
I will blow this place up, sir.

29:05.182 --> 29:07.347
<i>-Okay. Okay.</i>
-Oh, sir, most importantly,

29:07.382 --> 29:08.920
I want to
talk to my daughter.

29:08.955 --> 29:11.087
I can't seem to get through.
<i>All right.</i>

29:11.122 --> 29:15.058
<i>Call you back in a little bit,</i>
<i>Mr. Weasley, okay?</i>
Yeah, that is absolutely fine.

29:19.999 --> 29:21.130
Okay.

29:34.046 --> 29:36.145
What you think?
Think the conversation
was good?

29:36.180 --> 29:38.147
Yes.
I think it was
a good conversation. You?

29:38.182 --> 29:39.412
Yes.
Yeah.

29:40.085 --> 29:41.315
Yeah.

29:58.334 --> 30:00.268
Mom?
Mmm.

30:00.303 --> 30:02.501
Mama?
Mm-hmm.

30:15.483 --> 30:17.054
Mama.
Mm-hmm.

30:17.089 --> 30:19.122
Mom.
Mm-hmm.

30:19.157 --> 30:21.223
Someone must
really wanna talk
to you.

30:21.258 --> 30:23.929
Okay, baby. My phone...

30:25.163 --> 30:26.195
Okay.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.901
Okay.

30:29.365 --> 30:30.463
Let me see.

30:32.302 --> 30:34.005
Okay, baby.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.074
Hello.
<i> Hello, Cass?</i>

30:37.109 --> 30:39.307
Yes.
<i>I've been calling you</i>
<i>all morning.</i>

30:39.342 --> 30:41.078
<i>Why you ain't</i>
<i>pick up your phone?</i>

30:41.113 --> 30:43.410
All right, all right, all right.
I'm up now, all right?

30:43.445 --> 30:46.512
I just-- Why you call me
so many times?
It's not even your number.

30:46.547 --> 30:49.416
That's why you should have
picked up your damn phone.
I've been callin' and callin'...

30:49.451 --> 30:52.452
I had a patient die
at four o'clock this morning.
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

30:52.487 --> 30:55.422
Oh, no. Don't do that, okay?
Hey, look, uh...

30:58.394 --> 31:00.427
I'm in the middle
of something and, um,

31:02.200 --> 31:06.400
depending on how everything
works out, I-- I might
go to jail for a long time.

31:06.435 --> 31:09.337
Okay. Listen, Brian, I--

31:10.208 --> 31:11.570
Are you off your medication?

31:13.607 --> 31:15.079
Don't do that, Cass.

31:15.114 --> 31:17.983
<i>I was just calling</i>
<i>to tell you that</i>

31:18.018 --> 31:19.677
<i>if something</i>
<i>were to happen to me...</i>

31:21.285 --> 31:23.318
<i>I'm trying to do right, okay?</i>

31:23.353 --> 31:27.223
<i>I'm trying</i>
<i>to right something here,</i>
<i>and I'm in a little situation.</i>

31:27.258 --> 31:30.193
<i>And I just wanted you to know</i>
<i>I'm just trying to do</i>
<i>the right thing.</i>

31:30.228 --> 31:32.723
<i>I'm trying to make</i>
<i>the right decisions.</i>
Yeah...

31:32.758 --> 31:35.660
And I'm just trying to tell you
that everything I do...

31:37.169 --> 31:39.004
Everything I do
is for you and Kiah.

31:39.039 --> 31:40.335
Mm-hmm.
<i>Everything.</i>

31:40.370 --> 31:42.634
Yeah, well, uh, Brian,
I don't--

31:42.669 --> 31:46.737
I don't really know
where you're going with this,
so...

31:46.772 --> 31:50.048
I don't know what--
Okay, thank you.

31:55.385 --> 31:57.616
You know what, you right.
Put my daughter on the phone.

31:57.651 --> 32:00.520
<i>All right.</i>
<i>But don't you be spooking her</i>
<i>like you did.</i>

32:00.555 --> 32:02.522
I never spook our baby.

32:02.557 --> 32:05.360
<i>Yesterday you told her how</i>
<i>you got thrown on the street</i>
<i>in handcuffs.</i>

32:05.395 --> 32:07.659
She needs to know
how this world treats
people like us.

32:07.694 --> 32:10.761
<i>I'm just letting her know.</i>
<i>She's about to be</i>
<i>in the world herself.</i>

32:10.796 --> 32:13.302
Yeah, all right, Brian.

32:13.337 --> 32:15.700
I'm not going through this
with you again, all right?

32:16.472 --> 32:18.274
<i> Yes, ma'am.</i>

32:19.541 --> 32:21.112
Kiah!

32:21.147 --> 32:23.180
<i>Your father's on the phone,</i>
<i>Kiah.</i>

32:23.215 --> 32:24.984
Hey, she mad?

32:26.812 --> 32:28.515
<i>She got reason to be.</i>

32:35.656 --> 32:37.128
Cassandra...

32:38.731 --> 32:42.793
I'm holding up the bank,
and now's not the right time
to be ignoring my calls, okay?

32:42.828 --> 32:46.038
<i>I've got hostages.</i>
<i>I'm holding up the bank.</i>
You're not--

32:46.073 --> 32:50.240
<i>So, could you put my daughter</i>
<i>on the phone, please?</i>

32:50.275 --> 32:51.340
Thank you.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.099
<i> Daddy?</i>

33:14.860 --> 33:17.300
Hey, hey,
hey, baby girl.

33:17.335 --> 33:19.566
Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

33:19.601 --> 33:20.633
Hey.

33:23.176 --> 33:26.474
I just wanted to let you know
that I love you, okay.

33:26.509 --> 33:29.378
Are you apologizing
and picking me up?

33:29.413 --> 33:33.217
<i>You gonna be mean to Daddy?</i>
<i>You ain't gonna give Daddy</i>
<i>a break?</i>

33:33.252 --> 33:35.417
<i>Baby, you know</i>
<i>I'll always tell you the truth.</i>

33:35.452 --> 33:38.123
And, uh, I hurt you.
I did.

33:38.158 --> 33:40.125
<i>Well, you shouldn't have</i>
<i>given me your word.</i>

33:40.160 --> 33:42.688
I apologize, baby.
<i>That's not telling the truth.</i>

33:42.723 --> 33:46.263
You hate when people
don't tell you the truth.
<i>I know. I know.</i>

33:46.298 --> 33:51.235
Baby, you know, sometimes
when people steal from you,
you've got no choice.

33:51.270 --> 33:52.731
You gotta get it back.

33:53.734 --> 33:56.669
And when I do,
I'm gonna get you a puppy.

33:58.805 --> 34:00.673
Are you for real?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

34:00.708 --> 34:03.742
<i>Yes. That's the first thing</i>
<i>on my list.</i>

34:03.777 --> 34:07.482
Okay, call me when you're ready.
Love you. Bye.

34:07.517 --> 34:09.649
-Don't hang up. Hey.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.520
What did your father say?

34:12.554 --> 34:15.721
He got money,
so he's gonna get me
my puppy.

34:24.567 --> 34:26.303
Just like your damn mama.

34:42.453 --> 34:43.815
You look scared.

34:45.753 --> 34:47.126
You scared?

34:48.327 --> 34:49.425
I am.

34:54.201 --> 34:55.563
I told you...

34:58.403 --> 34:59.897
if I die today...

35:02.407 --> 35:03.571
I die alone.

35:19.457 --> 35:20.654
Come on, Easley.

35:46.319 --> 35:47.351
Hello?

35:47.386 --> 35:49.617
<i>Hi, is Bridget back yet?</i>

35:49.652 --> 35:52.620
Ma'am, the bank is being robbed.
I'm the one robbing it.
Do not call again!

35:56.021 --> 35:57.592
Come on, man.

35:58.529 --> 35:59.594
Come on.

36:20.518 --> 36:23.684
Kiah. Baby,
go back to your room.

36:23.719 --> 36:26.324
Why I gotta be
in my room, Mama?
Listen.

36:26.359 --> 36:29.426
When I know
what I need to know,
I'll let you know, okay?

36:29.461 --> 36:31.593
Please, baby.
Just go back
to your room.

36:34.499 --> 36:35.531
Thank you.

36:42.771 --> 36:45.541
Brian? Brian?

36:51.516 --> 36:55.617
My ex-husband-- same thing
happened to him almost.

36:57.852 --> 36:59.016
I, um--

37:00.085 --> 37:01.557
I'm scared.

37:03.990 --> 37:05.957
But I feel compassion
for you.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.402
You know,
my son and, uh, I...

37:13.373 --> 37:15.538
...we go to downtown Atlanta
on the weekends,

37:15.573 --> 37:17.408
pass out to the homeless.

37:20.908 --> 37:22.677
And they have stories.

37:25.517 --> 37:31.356
People judge.
They underestimate how folks
get in their position.

37:32.359 --> 37:33.820
I know stories like yours.

37:33.855 --> 37:35.888
They fought for the country,

37:35.923 --> 37:38.561
and they come here
and they don't get approved,
and I'm like...

37:39.729 --> 37:41.894
"I'm sorry."

37:41.929 --> 37:43.368
I'm sorry.

37:46.604 --> 37:47.669
Who's that?

37:50.377 --> 37:51.640
An old friend.

37:53.941 --> 37:56.007
It's your ex-husband.

37:57.846 --> 38:03.388
I mean, if-- if it is,
you probably should
hit him back.

38:03.423 --> 38:06.721
Ain't nothing
harder on the heart
than reaching out to an ex

38:07.526 --> 38:08.921
and not hearing
from them.

38:10.023 --> 38:11.726
I see you love your family.

38:11.761 --> 38:14.498
My close family.

38:14.533 --> 38:15.829
My daughter,

38:17.162 --> 38:18.469
Kiah.

38:21.870 --> 38:23.969
Maybe if you let us out,

38:24.004 --> 38:26.675
-we'll tell them
how good you been to us.
-They're not gonna kill me?

38:31.616 --> 38:33.044
They're not gonna kill me?

38:43.925 --> 38:46.090
Did you tell me
about your family
and your husband

38:46.125 --> 38:47.696
and your good times

38:47.731 --> 38:49.126
'cause you think
I'm a fool?

38:49.161 --> 38:52.536
-No.
-Try to soften me up?
Is that what it is?

38:52.571 --> 38:56.507
You think I'm dumb or slow?
Is that what it is?
No. Not at all.

38:56.542 --> 39:00.170
'Cause people be doing that
a lot. Thinking I'm a fool,
thinking I'm slow.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.579
I-- I don't know
if that's what
you was doing, ma'am.

39:02.614 --> 39:03.943
Brother, you're not a fool.

39:03.978 --> 39:07.914
I'm not a fool?
Okay. I'm not a fool.

39:09.214 --> 39:12.424
I'm just scared.

39:12.459 --> 39:14.690
That's all. Scared.

39:14.725 --> 39:15.889
Okay.

39:18.597 --> 39:19.926
I understand.

39:23.228 --> 39:26.471
You gonna turn the TV off.
This is not working.

39:39.244 --> 39:43.048
Did y'all just turn off the TV
in the bus-- in the business?

39:43.083 --> 39:45.985
You've got to let me know
what he's doing inside the bank.

39:46.020 --> 39:50.990
Excuse me if I'm not doing
exactly what you need of me.

39:51.025 --> 39:55.599
I don't know what
y'all are doing. We need someone
to negotiate with him now.

40:08.944 --> 40:11.241
Bernard!
Hey, how you doing?

40:11.276 --> 40:13.144
Riddick
is setting the perimeter.

40:13.179 --> 40:15.850
Wants the area clear
of any potential bombs
or co-conspirators.

40:15.885 --> 40:18.050
Okay.
We got four
SWAT units here.

40:18.085 --> 40:21.856
Cobb County PD, plus Marietta.

40:21.891 --> 40:23.957
Cobb sheriff's team is out.

40:23.992 --> 40:25.057
Got the dogs.

40:25.092 --> 40:27.224
Smyrna PD.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.501
We got the FBI, the GBI.

40:29.536 --> 40:31.635
Everybody here.
Got yourself a party.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.266
So how many snipers
we got?

40:36.301 --> 40:40.039
Uh, three units,
as I understand.

40:40.074 --> 40:42.943
But like I said,
there's a lot going on.

40:45.145 --> 40:48.916
-That's the new chief?
-Yeah. That's him.

41:07.640 --> 41:10.674
WSB-TV tip-line.
This is Lisa Larson.
What's your tip?

41:10.709 --> 41:12.643
<i>Hello, this is, uh,</i>
<i>Brian Brown-Easley.</i>

41:12.678 --> 41:15.877
<i>I'm heisting a Wells Fargo</i>
<i>on Windy Hills Road,</i>

41:15.912 --> 41:18.946
<i>and I have a bomb and hostages.</i>

41:18.981 --> 41:20.783
You're what?

41:20.818 --> 41:22.884
<i>Just calling</i>
<i>to let y'all know.</i>
Uh...

41:24.118 --> 41:26.052
You're at the Wells Fargo--

41:26.087 --> 41:27.757
You're at the Wells Fargo now,

41:27.792 --> 41:30.320
at the bank--
holding up the bank

41:30.355 --> 41:32.729
and you're calling us at WSB?

41:33.864 --> 41:35.996
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

41:36.031 --> 41:38.295
Uh, what was your name again,
sir, please?

41:38.330 --> 41:39.967
<i>My name is Brian Brown-Easley.</i>

41:40.002 --> 41:43.707
Brian Brown-Easley.

41:45.172 --> 41:48.074
Okay, you hold one sec.
<i>Okay.</i>

41:49.143 --> 41:52.210
I want you to sit here,
close to the camera.

41:54.346 --> 41:57.655
Lisa's got
the Windy Hill robber
on the line.

41:57.690 --> 41:59.118
All right, I'm hot.

42:01.056 --> 42:02.088
You got sound?

42:03.322 --> 42:04.794
Yeah, we're good.

42:05.830 --> 42:07.093
We're recording.

42:07.128 --> 42:09.865
Okay, thank you. Um--

42:09.900 --> 42:12.967
And how would you
like to be addressed?
Is it Brian?

42:13.002 --> 42:14.903
<i>Or-- Or Mr. Easley?</i>

42:14.938 --> 42:16.707
Brian's good.
<i>Okay, Brian.</i>

42:16.742 --> 42:19.303
Why are you holding up
a bank today, sir?

42:20.174 --> 42:22.779
<i>Because I'm a nobody to the VA.</i>

42:22.814 --> 42:25.012
You know,
just so we can verify
who you are,

42:25.047 --> 42:27.080
do you have
a social security number
or something?

42:27.115 --> 42:29.918
You trying to
steal my money too,
like the VA?

42:29.953 --> 42:32.217
<i>No, no, no.</i>
Trying to take my cash?

42:32.252 --> 42:35.055
No, I'm good.
I'm not trying
to steal your money.

42:35.090 --> 42:36.958
This is--
This is just so we can help.

42:36.993 --> 42:40.027
<i>Ma'am, just so you know,</i>
<i>I don't have a criminal record.</i>

42:40.062 --> 42:41.996
<i>I mean this is not</i>
<i>my day-to-day.</i>

42:42.031 --> 42:46.737
Well, but you say
you have bombs, right?
Where'd you get that?

42:46.772 --> 42:49.839
Oh, I can't give you
that information, ma'am.

42:49.874 --> 42:53.942
<i>Well, is it something</i>
<i>that could, you know,</i>
<i>level the bank?</i>

42:57.211 --> 42:59.211
Probably gonna
take out the whole room.

42:59.246 --> 43:00.751
<i>What kind of bomb?</i>

43:00.786 --> 43:03.347
Semtex.
<i>Semtex?</i>

43:04.724 --> 43:05.657
Take care now.

43:06.253 --> 43:07.989
You too.

43:16.967 --> 43:19.033
<i>Can we contact Wells Fargo</i>
<i>security</i>

43:19.068 --> 43:23.004
<i>and see if they have</i>
<i>the cameras inside</i>
<i>that we might be able to access?</i>

43:29.210 --> 43:30.341
Major Riddick.

43:32.048 --> 43:33.982
Sergeant,
you up to speed?
Indeed.

43:34.919 --> 43:36.413
Okay, we're ready
to conference in.

43:36.448 --> 43:39.383
We're conferencing in.

43:40.485 --> 43:42.155
Ma'am, I'm--
I'm not a thief.

43:42.190 --> 43:44.355
<i>Okay, I haven't taken anything</i>
<i>from the bank.</i>

43:44.390 --> 43:46.258
<i>I'm a decorated marine.</i>
<i>I'm a lance corporal.</i>

43:46.293 --> 43:48.161
Who's this on the phone?

43:48.196 --> 43:49.426
WSB-TV.

43:52.134 --> 43:54.805
So why is the suspect
talking to a reporter
and not us?

43:54.840 --> 43:57.434
We were just buying time
until you decided
to show up.

43:58.272 --> 43:59.711
<i>Two tours Iraq.</i>

43:59.746 --> 44:01.372
Camp Fox and Taqaddum.

44:02.947 --> 44:04.111
Honorable discharge.

44:04.146 --> 44:06.718
<i> Good for you, sir.</i>

44:06.753 --> 44:10.084
<i>And did you make friends?</i>
<i>You know, along the way</i>
<i>that you've kept up with?</i>

44:10.119 --> 44:11.723
<i> Yeah, I did,</i>

44:11.758 --> 44:14.286
but we lost contact,
you know.

44:14.321 --> 44:16.728
I don't really check in
with nobody or everybody
these days.

44:16.763 --> 44:18.125
I kinda stay to myself.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.864
<i>So the VA...</i>
<i>What's going on there?</i>

44:38.147 --> 44:40.213
Okay. Okay. Thanks.

44:40.248 --> 44:42.853
So it looks like this payment
was redirected

44:42.888 --> 44:46.318
to a college you're using
your GI Bill at,
to cure a deficit.

44:46.353 --> 44:48.518
Good news is,
you're all caught up
on payments.

44:48.553 --> 44:51.829
I was not behind on anything.
Damn, I overpaid on that
Windows '08 bullshit.

44:51.864 --> 44:54.997
Disability checks
never are confiscated
unless there's an unpaid bill.

44:55.032 --> 44:56.526
Does an unpaid bill
sound familiar?

44:56.561 --> 44:59.298
I've been over this
with the VA helpline.
Twice.

44:59.333 --> 45:01.399
I called
the-the VA crisis-line.

45:01.434 --> 45:03.775
I called, uh, Lincoln Tech.

45:03.810 --> 45:08.010
I been down to the office,
but you-- you know what
the problem is, ma'am?

45:08.045 --> 45:10.342
-You don't write nothing down.

45:10.377 --> 45:13.081
If you put that pen
to that paper, you would
have that information.

45:13.116 --> 45:15.083
Please, please
don't raise your voice,
Mr. Easley.

45:15.118 --> 45:17.052
It's just a suggestion.

45:17.087 --> 45:19.219
-I ain't raising my voice.
-That's who's got your money.

45:20.486 --> 45:22.222
I have two jobs.

45:23.489 --> 45:24.895
Two.

45:24.930 --> 45:26.864
I've been ill.

45:26.899 --> 45:29.933
I had to take leave,
so I'm reliant
on this disability check.

45:31.431 --> 45:35.004
Ma'am, don't dip into my money
and call it a day.

45:38.372 --> 45:41.076
You gonna have me on--
on the streets.

45:42.849 --> 45:44.112
I'm a grown man.

45:45.181 --> 45:47.016
I won't be able to feed myself.

45:57.061 --> 46:00.227
We have programs
for those who are food
and housing insecure.

46:01.967 --> 46:05.364
You can call the helpline
or you can take a number
and wait in that line.

46:12.340 --> 46:13.471
Okay.

46:18.610 --> 46:19.513
Thank you.

46:23.384 --> 46:24.416
Next.

46:47.672 --> 46:51.080
Yeah, they said I still owe,
which is a damn lie.

46:51.115 --> 46:52.213
It's a lie.

46:53.282 --> 46:57.548
That must've been
very frustrating.

46:57.583 --> 47:00.353
<i>It was. I'm not a psychopath.</i>

47:00.388 --> 47:02.993
I know what I do
and I know what I don't.

47:03.028 --> 47:04.357
I know, I hear you.
<i>Truth.</i>

47:10.596 --> 47:11.661
I hear you, Brian.

47:11.696 --> 47:13.102
Do you?

47:15.370 --> 47:18.239
What station is this again?
<i>WSB-TV, why?</i>

47:18.274 --> 47:21.275
<i>We're recording right now,</i>
<i>we live, on TV?</i>

47:22.608 --> 47:24.047
Um...

47:24.984 --> 47:26.181
I'll take that as a no.

47:26.216 --> 47:27.512
<i>Well, what it means is that</i>

47:27.547 --> 47:30.317
<i>we're not gonna exploit you</i>
<i>for ratings.</i>

47:30.352 --> 47:34.321
<i>So we're gonna wait--</i>
I need the world to see
what's happening here.

47:34.356 --> 47:36.422
Can you do that for me,
ma'am?

47:36.457 --> 47:37.654
Can we do that?

47:37.689 --> 47:39.029
<i>Please.</i>

47:40.329 --> 47:42.362
Major Riddick,
are we allowed to go live?

47:42.397 --> 47:45.530
Hey, uh, put the TV on WSB.

47:47.369 --> 47:49.138
<i>We're working</i>
<i>to get you two out.</i>

47:49.173 --> 47:52.372
<i>Don't try nothing.</i>
<i>Just stay put until</i>
<i>we get there.</i>

47:54.409 --> 47:58.246
<i>Our priority</i>
<i>is the protection of life</i>
<i>inside the dwelling.</i>

47:58.281 --> 48:02.283
<i>We're now running</i>
<i>a multi-agency operation</i>
<i>to get these hostages out safe.</i>

48:02.318 --> 48:05.484
-<i> At what point</i>
<i>do you have to change...</i>
-Ma'am.

48:06.355 --> 48:08.223
You have
a police officer on air,

48:08.258 --> 48:10.720
but the man who the situation
is about is nowhere to be seen.

48:10.755 --> 48:13.426
-Does that make sense to you?
-Have you got kids?

48:13.461 --> 48:15.197
You know I do.

48:15.232 --> 48:18.134
<i>Well, then you know why</i>
<i>you called here first.</i>

48:20.039 --> 48:21.434
Why'd I do that?

48:21.469 --> 48:26.175
Because we are
not going to let
your children--

48:26.210 --> 48:28.078
yours and mine--

48:28.113 --> 48:31.312
<i>watch you blow up that bank</i>
<i>on the air.</i>

48:31.347 --> 48:35.250
<i>The suspect, I should say,</i>
<i>is workable...</i>

48:35.285 --> 48:37.989
<i>I understand he is a local.</i>
<i>Yes, but I cannot confirm that.</i>

48:38.024 --> 48:39.188
<i>And what can you tell us...</i>

48:39.223 --> 48:40.992
So what's it look like
out there?

48:41.027 --> 48:42.752
<i> It may have something</i>
<i>to do with this outcome.</i>

48:42.787 --> 48:45.260
<i>I do not have information</i>
<i>regarding that at this moment.</i>

48:45.295 --> 48:47.163
They got a lot of people
waiting for me?

49:09.121 --> 49:10.153
Hello?

49:10.188 --> 49:12.221
<i>Cassandra Easley?</i>
Yes.

49:12.256 --> 49:15.356
<i>I'm Agent Jackman of the FBI.</i>
<i>Can you confirm</i>
<i>your current address?</i>

49:24.070 --> 49:26.301
<i>Do you have any other family</i>
<i>we could contact?</i>

49:27.634 --> 49:30.767
<i>My brother. But we don't talk.</i>

49:30.802 --> 49:32.043
Nothing.

49:33.376 --> 49:35.376
Hey, everybody.

49:35.411 --> 49:37.444
Riddick, right?
Yes, sir.
Real pleasure.

49:37.479 --> 49:39.578
Fine job out here.
Got everything you need?

49:39.613 --> 49:44.088
Yeah, snipers are in place.
Area's clean.
Uh, no sign of an accomplice.

49:44.123 --> 49:46.453
Now that Bernard's here,
we're ready to rock and roll.

49:46.488 --> 49:49.291
Good, good. Atlanta's
watching you today, son.

49:49.326 --> 49:51.425
-<i> Okay, this is good.</i>
-No pressure.

49:51.460 --> 49:53.526
<i>...trying to figure out</i>
<i>what's happening over there...</i>

49:53.561 --> 49:56.628
Let's just give him
five more minutes.
Let him wind down.

49:57.796 --> 49:59.367
Lisa...

50:02.768 --> 50:04.537
can I ask you a question?

50:05.606 --> 50:06.638
<i>Sure.</i>

50:10.116 --> 50:11.442
Is life hard for you?

50:15.517 --> 50:17.748
It's hard for everybody I know.
They--

50:19.719 --> 50:21.521
Is it really hard, like--

50:23.855 --> 50:26.394
Seems like everywhere I turn,
they--

50:32.237 --> 50:34.567
You know, my own brother
put a hit out on me.

50:37.671 --> 50:41.310
How did he, uh...

50:41.345 --> 50:43.543
I don't know.
I don't know. They said--

50:44.579 --> 50:46.744
They said he put
20,000 on my head.

50:48.253 --> 50:49.681
Brian, who said that?

50:49.716 --> 50:51.782
The streets is talking.

50:56.525 --> 51:00.560
He a part
of some secret society,
some cult like that.

51:00.595 --> 51:05.136
I don't really mess with him,
but they real, real sick people.

51:06.205 --> 51:08.502
Just four kidnapping attempts
on me last year.

51:08.537 --> 51:10.702
You know that? Four.

51:13.509 --> 51:14.739
<i> Are you sure?</i>

51:15.841 --> 51:17.478
<i> Am I sure?</i>

51:17.513 --> 51:19.117
We gotta stop this.

51:19.647 --> 51:20.811
<i> All right.</i>

51:22.254 --> 51:23.253
<i>Uh...</i>

51:23.651 --> 51:25.156
<i>Well...</i>

51:25.191 --> 51:26.355
You know what?

51:28.392 --> 51:29.622
I don't need a translator.

51:31.296 --> 51:33.824
I need to be on the camera.
Can you send somebody down here?

51:33.859 --> 51:37.894
Oh. Well, we have, um--
we have reporters out there.

51:37.929 --> 51:40.765
Mark said that it can work, uh--
You can meet him at a window.

51:40.800 --> 51:42.767
Yeah, we have reporters
out there, uh--

51:42.802 --> 51:45.737
<i>But how would we do it?</i>
<i>Is there a window...</i>

51:49.413 --> 51:51.644
<i> Ma'am, ma'am,</i>
<i>I'm not going near the window.</i>

51:51.679 --> 51:53.547
I do not want to get shot.

51:53.582 --> 51:56.748
-Coming through. Coming through!
-Hey!

51:56.783 --> 51:59.487
Sir!
Stay away from that bank.

51:59.522 --> 52:02.325
Tell your reporters
to stay the fuck off the phone.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.195
You're jeopardizing
his life and yours.

52:04.230 --> 52:07.264
That reporter--
You have been warned.

52:10.269 --> 52:12.500
As you can see,
this is a very
volatile situation.

52:12.535 --> 52:15.965
Don't you have a--
a long lens that zoom in
that you can see me with?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.869
I'm asking about a long lens.
Oh, long lens. Let me ask.

52:18.904 --> 52:20.574
We're checking on that for you.

52:20.609 --> 52:23.478
<i>Because that's a good idea.</i>
<i>Keep you safe.</i>

52:23.513 --> 52:25.810
Major.
I can't prevent that.
Hold on.

52:25.845 --> 52:29.913
Major. We haven't even talked
to this guy yet, and you're
letting them film him?

52:29.948 --> 52:31.948
What are we doing here?
What is this?

52:31.983 --> 52:35.556
What is what?
You're highly emotional,
Sergeant.

52:37.021 --> 52:39.725
Sir, my professional opinion?

52:39.760 --> 52:41.793
This some bullshit.

52:41.828 --> 52:43.531
May I start
a direct line of communication

52:43.566 --> 52:45.731
so someone trained
in this field
can talk to him?

52:45.766 --> 52:47.931
<i>I'm at North Park,</i>
<i>trying to divert traffic...</i>

52:50.441 --> 52:51.473
Just push redial.

52:54.544 --> 52:56.247
Yeah, I'm back.

52:56.282 --> 52:58.678
<i>Suspect exits the bank,</i>
<i>he will not leave the sidewalk.</i>

52:58.713 --> 53:00.416
<i>Are you clear on that?</i>

53:00.451 --> 53:02.880
<i>Suspect exits the bank,</i>
<i>he will not leave the sidewalk.</i>

53:04.917 --> 53:06.851
Can you
send somebody down here?

53:10.857 --> 53:11.955
Ma'am, ma'am,

53:11.990 --> 53:14.562
I'm not going down there, okay?

53:14.597 --> 53:17.367
I do not wanna get sniped.

53:17.402 --> 53:19.600
Okay, I kinda hear him
talking in the background.

53:19.635 --> 53:21.965
<i>He's still on</i>
<i>with the media, right?</i>

53:22.902 --> 53:24.000
Uh-huh.

53:24.035 --> 53:25.573
We don't play that around here,

53:25.608 --> 53:26.937
I'll tell you that much.

53:39.655 --> 53:41.589
<i> Brian.</i>

53:41.624 --> 53:43.294
<i>Brian, calm down.</i>

53:45.023 --> 53:47.628
<i>I need to be on camera, okay?</i>

53:49.764 --> 53:51.335
<i> Yeah. Yeah.</i>

53:57.904 --> 54:00.311
Look, they're telling me

54:00.346 --> 54:03.512
that it's just going to
take a minute to locate
the camera equipment we need.

54:03.547 --> 54:05.712
But it's coming. Okay?

54:05.747 --> 54:07.351
You're lying.
<i>No, sir.</i>

54:07.386 --> 54:08.979
You're lying to me right now.
I can hear you.

54:09.014 --> 54:11.014
You're lying,
I hear it in your voice.
<i>No. No.</i>

54:11.049 --> 54:12.719
You know what,
we're gonna wrap this up.

54:12.754 --> 54:14.325
<i>No, no, no.</i>
We're gonna wrap this up.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.327
<i>Don't do that. Hey...</i>

54:16.758 --> 54:18.494
Wait, my, uh--

54:18.529 --> 54:22.091
God. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

54:22.126 --> 54:23.829
That's all I've been told!

54:23.864 --> 54:25.061
Is to wait!
<i>Brian.</i>

54:25.096 --> 54:26.700
What do I need to do

54:26.735 --> 54:30.000
to get the attention
that I need right now?

54:30.035 --> 54:31.507
Right now!

54:31.971 --> 54:33.839
Right now, ma'am!

54:33.874 --> 54:36.105
Brian. Brian, calm down.

54:36.140 --> 54:38.646
<i>Calm down.</i>
Is this what I need to do?

54:38.681 --> 54:40.648
<i>No. We're gonna--</i>

54:40.683 --> 54:43.354
<i>We're going to take care--</i>
This what I need to do? Okay.

54:43.389 --> 54:45.356
Okay.

54:45.391 --> 54:47.457
Is this what you need?

54:47.492 --> 54:51.054
Is this all the motivation
you need to get me
what I need?

54:51.089 --> 54:53.397
You have hostages
in here, ma'am!

54:54.158 --> 54:55.795
Hostages, and they scared!

54:55.830 --> 54:57.995
They scared
for their damn lives!
<i>Brian...</i>

54:58.030 --> 55:00.503
I need a phone call!
<i>Brian,</i>

55:00.538 --> 55:02.769
you have
my undivided attention.

55:02.804 --> 55:05.772
I don't need
your undivided attention!

55:05.807 --> 55:08.775
I need the attention of the VA!

55:08.810 --> 55:10.414
Not you!

55:12.847 --> 55:15.716
-Yeah, we're ready.
<i>All right. We're gonna do this.</i>

55:15.751 --> 55:16.783
You got it.

55:16.818 --> 55:17.916
Brian...

55:20.151 --> 55:22.151
<i>Now, ma'am, can you get me</i>
<i>this phone call?</i>

55:22.186 --> 55:24.791
<i>Hey, Brian...</i>
Or do I have to
blow this bitch up?

55:24.826 --> 55:29.961
<i>Brian, they just told me</i>
<i>the negotiator wants to call you</i>
<i>on this line, like, right now.</i>

55:30.964 --> 55:32.469
Negotiator
is on the phone, ma'am?

55:32.504 --> 55:33.866
You're not lying to me
right now?

55:33.901 --> 55:35.967
The negotiator
is on the phone?
<i>Yeah.</i>

55:36.002 --> 55:38.706
'Cause we can't go
back and forth no more.
We can't do that.

55:38.741 --> 55:43.579
No, no, no. So-- So--
You go talk to him.
And then you call me back.

55:47.816 --> 55:48.848
Okay.

55:52.183 --> 55:54.051
Okay, that's--
that's a start.

55:54.086 --> 55:55.525
That's a start.

55:58.629 --> 56:00.123
-Ring him through.
-Okay.

56:00.158 --> 56:02.026
Yeah.
She's doing it right now.

56:05.196 --> 56:06.569
I apologize.

56:16.482 --> 56:17.943
What are we going to report?

56:19.012 --> 56:20.077
Everything.

56:20.112 --> 56:21.848
<i> And we're live.</i>

56:21.883 --> 56:25.852
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

56:25.887 --> 56:29.053
<i> Breaking news,</i>
<i>we have a hostage standoff</i>
<i>at a Wells Fargo</i>

56:29.088 --> 56:31.858
with Team 2 coverage from
our news chopper in the air,

56:31.893 --> 56:33.959
and a team on the ground.

56:33.994 --> 56:38.535
The suspect made exclusive
contact with our seasoned
producer, Lisa Larson.

56:38.570 --> 56:42.198
<i>This is</i> Channel 2 Action News.
<i>We start with Keith James</i>
<i>live in Marietta.</i>

56:43.905 --> 56:46.202
We appear to have
a very volatile
situation here,

56:46.237 --> 56:49.777
where a man
has barricaded himself
inside a bank with...

56:49.812 --> 56:54.881
<i>...an explosive device</i>
<i>and a story that</i>
<i>he needs to have told.</i>

56:54.916 --> 56:59.149
<i>Police are no longer</i>
<i>calling this a robbery,</i>
<i>rather a hostage situation.</i>

56:59.184 --> 57:02.724
<i>And ten to 15 minutes ago,</i>
<i>the sheriff's SWAT team arrived.</i>

57:04.057 --> 57:05.958
<i>Keith, thank you.</i>
<i>And now to Mark Cavanaugh.</i>

57:05.993 --> 57:09.060
<i>He's live on the other side</i>
<i>of this standoff with police.</i>

57:09.095 --> 57:11.931
<i>Mark, what can you tell us</i>
<i>about the suspect?</i>

57:13.935 --> 57:17.233
<i>Well, I can tell you</i>
<i>the area has been sealed off.</i>

57:17.268 --> 57:21.578
<i>I've also been assured</i>
<i>that the public</i>
<i>is not in danger.</i>

57:21.613 --> 57:24.911
<i>Now, the suspect inside</i>
<i>that Wells Fargo</i>
<i>told us he's a marine,</i>

57:24.946 --> 57:29.718
<i>and we've worked</i>
<i>with several agencies</i>
<i>to confirm that he is in fact</i>

57:29.753 --> 57:32.721
<i>Lance Corporal</i>
<i>Brian Brown-Easley.</i>

57:33.218 --> 57:34.558
Daddy.

57:35.924 --> 57:36.956
Huh?

57:39.158 --> 57:43.127
<i>...our own Lisa Larson had</i>
<i>with the former marine.</i>

57:49.905 --> 57:53.577
<i>I just want to say...</i>
<i>He's calm and composed</i>

57:53.612 --> 57:55.645
<i>and came across as caring.</i>

58:23.268 --> 58:24.872
<i> Gandalf?</i>

58:24.907 --> 58:26.236
<i> No.</i>

58:26.271 --> 58:27.974
<i> Gimli?</i>

58:28.009 --> 58:29.613
<i> One guess left.</i>

58:29.648 --> 58:31.307
<i> Okay, Gollum.</i>

58:31.342 --> 58:33.276
Does she look like a Gollum?

58:44.927 --> 58:46.124
Hello?

58:46.159 --> 58:47.697
<i>Hi, is this Mr. Easley?</i>

58:49.096 --> 58:51.261
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

58:51.296 --> 58:54.935
<i>This is Eli Bernard,</i>
<i>chief negotiator</i>
<i>for Marietta PD.</i>

58:56.070 --> 59:00.171
<i> Chief?</i>
<i>Damn, they sent me the big dog.</i>

59:00.206 --> 59:02.140
<i>I'm actually a sergeant,</i>
<i>but that doesn't matter.</i>

59:03.143 --> 59:05.110
<i>I'm just pleased</i>
<i>to be talking to you.</i>

59:05.849 --> 59:06.881
Why you pleased?

59:06.916 --> 59:08.685
<i>I like to help people.</i>

59:08.720 --> 59:11.248
<i>And it looks like</i>
<i>you can use some help today.</i>

59:11.283 --> 59:14.218
Yeah, you the chief.
Then we good, man.

59:14.253 --> 59:17.254
People know the truth
when they hear it.
<i>I do agree.</i>

59:17.289 --> 59:21.632
My mama said show me a liar
and I'll show you a thief.

59:21.667 --> 59:23.832
<i> Mine said the same.</i>
Right.

59:23.867 --> 59:28.100
<i>-Your mama sound</i>
<i>like a smart woman.</i>
-Oh, she's smart. She was.

59:29.708 --> 59:31.642
I'm sorry.
<i>No. No sorries.</i>

59:31.677 --> 59:34.040
We all die
at our appointed time.

59:34.075 --> 59:37.307
Yes, we do. So tell me, Brian,
what can I do for you today?

59:37.342 --> 59:39.881
Is it okay
if I call you Brian?
<i>Absolutely. Uh--</i>

59:41.379 --> 59:43.412
<i>Sir, I know</i>
<i>you know why I'm here.</i>

59:43.447 --> 59:47.185
<i>And I just simply want</i>
<i>my money back. That's all.</i>

59:47.220 --> 59:49.825
From the VA, right?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

59:49.860 --> 59:53.191
Yeah, I've had some problems
with Veteran Affairs myself.

59:53.226 --> 59:56.898
It's difficult
when they drag their feet.
<i>Right.</i>

59:56.933 --> 59:58.966
<i>Hey, what branch of service</i>
<i>you in?</i>

59:59.705 --> 01:00:00.935
Marine.

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:02.365
<i>Semper fi, sir.</i>

01:00:03.907 --> 01:00:05.808
Where'd you train?

01:00:05.843 --> 01:00:07.403
<i>I'm a West Coaster.</i>

01:00:07.438 --> 01:00:09.075
<i>MCRD, San Diego.</i>

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.242
Okay, okay.
So you one of them
Hollywood brothers

01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:12.815
with the veneers
in your mouth, huh?

01:00:14.082 --> 01:00:15.818
Shooting bubble gum bullets.

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.020
I'm from St. Louis,
Missouri.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:23.727
But yes, sir,
a Hollywood marine I am.

01:00:24.994 --> 01:00:28.226
<i>So tell me, sir,</i>
<i>how can we put this back</i>
<i>in the VA's hands</i>

01:00:28.261 --> 01:00:29.997
<i>versus the bank tellers?</i>

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:35.035
<i> Tell the VA</i>
<i>to send over the cash</i>
<i>and fix it.</i>

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:36.773
<i>That's all, okay?</i>

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.007
<i> Anything else</i>
<i>you need help with?</i>

01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:45.111
<i>Brian?</i>

01:00:45.146 --> 01:00:50.721
Yeah, I need you to help me
find the words to tell my
ex-wife and my daughter that...

01:00:52.417 --> 01:00:53.922
that I'm gonna die.

01:00:55.827 --> 01:00:58.124
<i>Sir, with all due respect,</i>

01:00:58.159 --> 01:01:01.457
<i>it is my responsibility</i>
<i>to make sure that you</i>
<i>get out of here alive.</i>

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:03.162
Yeah, I understand,

01:01:03.197 --> 01:01:05.769
but we both know
they going to kill me, man.
They--

01:01:06.332 --> 01:01:08.266
We both know I'm dying here.

01:01:09.368 --> 01:01:10.906
You know.

01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:12.776
Ain't nothing for me out there
but bullets.

01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:17.110
At least everybody gonna know.
They gonna know how
the VA do, man.

01:01:17.145 --> 01:01:18.210
They gonna know.

01:01:19.279 --> 01:01:20.817
Everybody will see.

01:01:23.283 --> 01:01:25.481
<i>You said you had an ex-wife.</i>

01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:29.353
<i>I got one of those too.</i>
<i>Painful.</i>

01:01:29.388 --> 01:01:32.356
<i>Anybody else in your life</i>
<i>I can contact?</i>
Like a woman?

01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:34.292
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:01:34.327 --> 01:01:37.526
<i>I had but one</i>
<i>deep cut in my life,</i>
<i>and I married her.</i>

01:01:37.561 --> 01:01:38.967
Well done you, sir.

01:01:41.466 --> 01:01:42.938
She beautiful.

01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:47.404
Yeah, actually, uh,
I had thought about her...

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.881
right at the moment
I decided to do...

01:01:53.852 --> 01:01:55.247
what I'm doing right now.

01:01:55.282 --> 01:01:57.216
<i>When was that moment, Brian?</i>

01:02:07.063 --> 01:02:10.394
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:02:11.969 --> 01:02:13.969
I don't wanna--
I'm not gonna leave!

01:02:14.004 --> 01:02:16.268
I'm not leaving until-- No!

01:02:16.303 --> 01:02:17.533
No!
Okay.

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:19.942
I want my cash!
Take a breath.

01:02:19.977 --> 01:02:21.812
Where's my money?

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.447
<i>In front of all those brothers.</i>

01:02:33.859 --> 01:02:36.486
I tried to go about it
the way we trained, but...

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.898
sir, they've taken
everything from me.

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:44.967
Everything.

01:02:47.169 --> 01:02:48.806
I apologize.

01:02:50.073 --> 01:02:51.303
<i>For what?</i>

01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:55.439
Well, that--
that another human being,
a fellow marine,

01:02:55.474 --> 01:02:57.573
<i>had to go through so much.</i>

01:02:57.608 --> 01:02:59.476
<i>How much money</i>
<i>does the VA owe you?</i>

01:03:00.919 --> 01:03:03.920
<i> $892.34.</i>

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:07.517
That it?

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.860
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:15.162
<i>Sir, your honor's worth</i>
<i>more than $892.</i>

01:03:16.462 --> 01:03:19.331
You're worth more than $892.

01:03:20.037 --> 01:03:21.432
I'm worth nothing.

01:03:29.475 --> 01:03:30.980
I am nothing.

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:36.117
I'm gonna die tonight...

01:03:38.319 --> 01:03:40.154
and nobody will care why.

01:03:41.124 --> 01:03:42.552
CNT's up and running.

01:03:42.587 --> 01:03:44.389
Let's get you in there
so we can hear y'all.

01:03:49.495 --> 01:03:50.560
Look...

01:03:52.564 --> 01:03:56.203
This is what we're going to do,
okay? Brother to brother.

01:03:56.238 --> 01:03:58.502
I'm gonna call your ex-wife
and daughter.

01:03:58.537 --> 01:04:01.439
I'ma tell her that
we have talked and we're
going to work this out.

01:04:01.474 --> 01:04:03.639
<i>Then I'm going to call you back.</i>

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.080
<i>Is that okay?</i>

01:04:06.248 --> 01:04:08.248
Okay.
<i>Now, after I've done that,</i>
<i>Brian,</i>

01:04:08.283 --> 01:04:10.118
<i>I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>to do me a favor.</i>

01:04:10.153 --> 01:04:13.121
I'm going to need you
to let one of the ladies go.

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.255
Can you do that for me?

01:04:17.655 --> 01:04:19.259
<i>Brian, you still there?</i>

01:04:20.658 --> 01:04:23.494
What about the cash?
What about the money?

01:04:23.529 --> 01:04:27.036
I give my word as a marine
and on my daddy,

01:04:27.071 --> 01:04:29.368
you let one of them go,
and we will sort this out.

01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:33.944
They're gonna come in that door
and crack my head open.

01:04:33.979 --> 01:04:36.947
Ain't nobody coming in there
and cracking open your skull,
man.

01:04:36.982 --> 01:04:39.213
No. No, no, sir.
Not on my word.

01:04:39.248 --> 01:04:41.413
Nigga, please, you don't
control these people, man.
You ain't got no power.

01:04:41.448 --> 01:04:44.251
Don't do that to me now.
Don't you underestimate me.

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:46.220
Not me.

01:04:50.391 --> 01:04:53.689
I'm gonna call your family
and I'll call you back
in a moment.

01:04:54.329 --> 01:04:55.361
<i>All right?</i>

01:04:57.596 --> 01:04:58.628
Okay.

01:05:04.174 --> 01:05:09.980
Don't you ever, ever
disrespect me or cut me off
when I'm talking, sir!

01:05:11.148 --> 01:05:12.741
Give me the ex-wife's number.

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:15.579
<i>A man has taken over</i>
<i>a Wells Fargo bank</i>

01:05:15.614 --> 01:05:17.548
<i>and is threatening</i>
<i>to blow it up.</i>

01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:21.684
<i>He apparently has an explosive,</i>
<i>some sort of backpack</i>
<i>or package--</i>

01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:27.624
Hello?
<i>Hello, Ms. Easley.</i>

01:05:27.659 --> 01:05:29.560
<i>I'm Sergeant Bernard</i>
<i>from the Marietta</i>
<i>Police Depart--</i>

01:05:29.595 --> 01:05:31.100
Is he dead?

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:32.662
<i>No. No, ma'am.</i>

01:05:32.697 --> 01:05:35.005
<i>No, Brian is still</i>
<i>very much alive.</i>

01:05:37.207 --> 01:05:39.438
<i>Say, you got FaceTime?</i>

01:05:39.473 --> 01:05:41.770
Yeah.
<i>I just want you to see me.</i>

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:44.509
Uh, yeah, I do. I do. I do.
Hold on.

01:05:46.216 --> 01:05:47.512
<i>Okay, good.</i>

01:05:47.547 --> 01:05:49.085
I am pressin' that button...

01:05:50.451 --> 01:05:53.254
right about... now.

01:05:53.289 --> 01:05:55.157
<i>Hi.</i>

01:05:55.192 --> 01:05:58.226
I gotta tell you,
I'm not too much
for all this technology,

01:05:58.261 --> 01:06:00.261
but let's just say
it's a pleasure to see you.

01:06:00.296 --> 01:06:01.757
Yeah.

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:04.298
<i>First of all, I want to let</i>
<i>you and your daughter know</i>

01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:08.335
<i>I do this day in and day out,</i>
<i>and I know a good man</i>
<i>when I see one.</i>

01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.634
<i>Your husband's a good man.</i>

01:06:10.669 --> 01:06:14.407
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.
I know that. He wouldn't--
He wouldn't hurt a spider.

01:06:14.442 --> 01:06:17.443
<i>He has these episodes,</i>
<i>sometimes,</i>

01:06:17.478 --> 01:06:19.775
<i>but nothing like this,</i>
<i>nothing this bad.</i>

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.052
Has he ever been violent
towards you or your daughter?

01:06:22.087 --> 01:06:25.616
<i>Violent? No. No. Hell, no.</i>
<i>He loves that child</i>
<i>with his whole heart.</i>

01:06:25.651 --> 01:06:27.585
<i>That's good to know.</i>

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:30.555
<i>And before I go,</i>
<i>is there anything</i>
<i>I can help you with?</i>

01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:34.064
Yeah. Yeah, you can tell me
why the FBI is on their way
to my house.

01:06:34.099 --> 01:06:36.429
I didn't-- I didn't--
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:06:36.464 --> 01:06:39.300
I apologize, ma'am.
That's just procedure.

01:06:39.335 --> 01:06:41.137
This here's my number.

01:06:41.172 --> 01:06:43.601
If they do anything
you don't like,
you just call me.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.372
Make sense?

01:06:45.407 --> 01:06:46.538
<i>Yeah, it does.</i>

01:06:47.607 --> 01:06:49.739
<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>you want me to tell Brian?</i>

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:51.642
Yeah.

01:06:52.447 --> 01:06:54.282
Yeah, tell him that I--

01:06:54.317 --> 01:06:57.813
Tell him that Kiah says,
"Don't do nothing stupid."

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:01.685
<i>Okay, ma'am.</i>

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.522
<i>I'll make sure</i>
<i>to pass that along.</i>

01:07:03.557 --> 01:07:05.689
All right. Thank you.

01:07:05.724 --> 01:07:08.527
<i>You're welcome.</i>
<i>Bye now.</i>

01:07:23.181 --> 01:07:26.149
<i>Wells Fargo confirms,</i>
<i>cameras live any moment now.</i>

01:07:29.319 --> 01:07:32.386
<i> All units,</i>
<i>suspect does not leave</i>
<i>the perimeter with the bomb.</i>

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:41.428
<i> Hey, Brian.</i>
<i>I spoke to your ex-wife, man.</i>

01:07:41.463 --> 01:07:44.431
We actually video talked, but--
<i>Good, you did?</i>

01:07:44.466 --> 01:07:45.696
She's a lovely lady.

01:07:46.501 --> 01:07:47.863
<i>They okay?</i>

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:49.799
She and your daughter
are doing just fine.

01:07:49.834 --> 01:07:52.505
<i>Told Cassandra she can call me</i>
<i>if she needs anything.</i>

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.672
That's mighty fine of you.
Did you call the VA too?

01:07:54.707 --> 01:07:56.707
<i>To tell the truth,</i>
<i>that's going to take some time.</i>

01:07:56.742 --> 01:07:58.775
But I did
what I said I was going to do,

01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:02.251
so, how about you release
one of those ladies?

01:08:02.286 --> 01:08:05.452
I'ma release both of them
when the money's in my account.

01:08:05.487 --> 01:08:07.784
I was really clear.
<i>You gave me your word, marine.</i>

01:08:07.819 --> 01:08:10.193
Now don't do that.
Do not do that.

01:08:10.228 --> 01:08:11.557
I did not reply, sir.

01:08:11.592 --> 01:08:13.724
Now, you got me there.
<i>Okay.</i>

01:08:14.892 --> 01:08:16.363
It's just, uh,

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:17.694
<i>I care about you, Brian.</i>

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:19.729
<i>I care about you</i>
<i>just as much as I care about</i>

01:08:19.765 --> 01:08:21.468
<i>what them ladies</i>
<i>must be going through.</i>

01:08:21.502 --> 01:08:22.832
<i> I understand</i>
<i>you're good at your job.</i>

01:08:22.867 --> 01:08:25.636
<i>But I need you to go do it.</i>
<i>Just call the VA.</i>

01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:31.247
<i> You went from</i>
<i>10% to 50% disability. Right?</i>

01:08:34.384 --> 01:08:35.416
How you know that?

01:08:36.518 --> 01:08:38.649
Well, the VA just
sent over your file.

01:08:38.685 --> 01:08:41.158
<i>You were hurt in Iraqi Freedom.</i>

01:08:42.425 --> 01:08:43.886
<i> Yeah, right again.</i>

01:08:43.921 --> 01:08:46.460
<i> It is a bitch</i>
<i>getting shot in the heat.</i>

01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:49.760
<i>You-- You were shot, right?</i>

01:08:49.795 --> 01:08:51.332
No, I was injured.

01:08:53.733 --> 01:08:57.569
I was. Which means
you're just like me.

01:08:58.474 --> 01:09:00.506
<i>You've been through worse.</i>

01:09:00.542 --> 01:09:03.774
<i>You just gotta</i>
<i>push through, Brian.</i>
<i>I'll be here to help.</i>

01:09:03.809 --> 01:09:05.908
I understand
that you having conversations

01:09:05.943 --> 01:09:08.548
that you're supposed
to be having with the VA,
but what you need to do,

01:09:08.582 --> 01:09:09.912
rather than trying to
straighten me out,

01:09:09.947 --> 01:09:13.223
<i>is call them,</i>
<i>then have them call me.</i>

01:09:13.258 --> 01:09:15.786
Because you know what you did?
You gave me your word, sir.

01:09:15.821 --> 01:09:17.854
You did that.

01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:21.429
So if that isn't
the conversation,
then we don't need to talk.

01:09:21.464 --> 01:09:23.233
<i>Come on, Brian.</i>

01:09:23.268 --> 01:09:24.926
They taught us
better than this.

01:09:24.962 --> 01:09:28.337
No, no, no, no.
<i>We can fix this.</i>
<i>This is human error.</i>

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:30.569
I'm gonna die
because of that human error.

01:09:30.604 --> 01:09:31.636
Sleep on that.

01:09:39.482 --> 01:09:40.514
Shit.

01:09:48.953 --> 01:09:50.622
I'm here, my baby.

01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:55.331
Please don't answer that.
It's Brian.

01:09:55.366 --> 01:09:58.565
There'll be a moment
when you can.
Just not now.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.830
Hold on, baby.

01:10:06.905 --> 01:10:08.245
Come here.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.452
I understand he is a local,
but I cannot confirm that.

01:10:27.629 --> 01:10:29.728
<i>Hi, this is Cassandra Deets--</i>

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:40.607
<i> Hey, Brian.</i>
<i>Don't put the phone down.</i>

01:10:40.642 --> 01:10:43.005
Since you didn't let those
ladies out, you can at least
let me speak to one of them.

01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:48.483
Hold on.

01:11:01.696 --> 01:11:02.860
Negotiator wants to talk.

01:11:06.503 --> 01:11:07.535
Estel.

01:11:12.674 --> 01:11:14.003
Hello.

01:11:14.038 --> 01:11:15.543
<i>Hi, who am I speaking with?</i>

01:11:15.578 --> 01:11:17.875
Estel Valerie.
<i>Hello, Ms. Valerie.</i>

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:21.043
This is Sergeant Bernard.
Is everyone all right in there?

01:11:22.387 --> 01:11:23.881
No, we are not.

01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:27.555
What are you people
doing out there?

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.359
<i>Ma'am, we're doing</i>
<i>everything we possibly can</i>

01:11:29.394 --> 01:11:31.394
<i>to get y'all out of there</i>
<i>safely.</i>

01:11:31.429 --> 01:11:34.364
Well, how long does it take
to put money
into a man's account?

01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:36.795
Estel, just please
try to stay calm.

01:11:39.437 --> 01:11:40.766
I'm perfectly calm.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.638
<i>Okay. We're trying, ma'am.</i>

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:48.543
Well, try harder, please.

01:11:52.648 --> 01:11:55.913
WSB-TV tip-line.
This is Lisa Larson.
What's your tip?

01:12:01.558 --> 01:12:04.086
Absolutely.
Uh, what is your address?

01:12:05.727 --> 01:12:07.628
<i>The remaining feed is up now.</i>

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:11.665
Can you put Brian
back on the phone, please?

01:12:19.004 --> 01:12:20.707
<i> Hello?</i>

01:12:20.742 --> 01:12:22.973
I'm about to leave this car
and go over to the van.

01:12:23.008 --> 01:12:24.975
When I'm out there,
is there anything you'd like?

01:12:27.144 --> 01:12:28.814
Maybe some smokes?

01:12:30.015 --> 01:12:31.784
Okay. I can do that.

01:12:31.819 --> 01:12:33.148
<i>What kind do you like?</i>

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:35.689
Newports. Newport Longs.

01:12:35.724 --> 01:12:37.493
Brian,
when I buy these cigarettes,

01:12:37.528 --> 01:12:39.825
someone is going to have to
leave them at the door for you.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.596
We got a plan for that?

01:12:41.631 --> 01:12:43.092
<i>Can't you do it?</i>

01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:47.602
Okay.

01:12:47.637 --> 01:12:50.671
You give me a few minutes
to buy those cigarettes,
and I-- I'll meet you there.

01:12:53.808 --> 01:12:55.544
That's some bullshit.

01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:56.875
I ain't going near that.

01:12:58.945 --> 01:13:00.417
You know what,

01:13:01.112 --> 01:13:02.584
they're not going to fix it.

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.949
I will.

01:13:04.984 --> 01:13:08.183
I'm going to put your money
directly into your account.

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:12.121
That's not what
I need to happen.
So, no, thank you.

01:13:14.697 --> 01:13:15.960
Money is money.

01:13:17.766 --> 01:13:20.129
Why you care about
where it comes from?

01:13:20.164 --> 01:13:22.901
If I cared about the money,
I'd have had you do that
when I walked in, but I didn't.

01:13:22.936 --> 01:13:24.573
So, no, I do not need that.

01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:27.004
You think the VA
got their own printed money?

01:13:27.809 --> 01:13:29.171
We're the bank.

01:13:30.108 --> 01:13:31.206
We get it back.

01:13:33.551 --> 01:13:34.913
No.

01:13:34.948 --> 01:13:36.211
I want their money.

01:13:40.624 --> 01:13:42.118
So you set on dying?

01:13:46.927 --> 01:13:49.829
How many times
I gotta hide my son
from the news?

01:13:53.263 --> 01:13:54.669
I'll tell you what.

01:13:55.838 --> 01:14:00.070
When he asks me,
"What did you do
to stop him from dying?"

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:05.746
I'm gonna look him in the eye...

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.915
and know that I tried.

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:21.091
Please...

01:14:21.126 --> 01:14:26.965
...let me put what you're owed
into your account,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.264
and let's please go home.

01:14:33.171 --> 01:14:35.611
Look, you can bump it
to your-- your wife.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.778
Or your daughter.

01:14:40.816 --> 01:14:44.950
I don't care,
but I need you not to die.

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:47.656
Okay, Brian?

01:14:50.122 --> 01:14:54.091
Brian,
I need you not to die.

01:14:57.261 --> 01:14:58.766
Not today.

01:15:02.299 --> 01:15:03.540
Okay.

01:15:07.238 --> 01:15:09.909
I'm gonna handle this. Right?

01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:14.815
I should probably--

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.082
If I'm gonna
leave her something,

01:15:18.117 --> 01:15:20.282
I should probably
call Kiah, right?
Mm-hmm.

01:15:20.317 --> 01:15:22.185
You need some credit
on-- on the phone?

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.286
-Yes, ma'am, I do.
-Okay. That's on me.

01:15:24.321 --> 01:15:27.025
Okay.
I'ma need that number, okay?

01:15:35.904 --> 01:15:38.366
Estel might be losing it.

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:41.138
I reckon she's
going to take matters
into her own hands.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.778
Okay, well,
that's a problem.

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:47.012
We still got her
on the phone, right?

01:15:47.916 --> 01:15:49.311
Why is that a problem?

01:15:49.346 --> 01:15:50.983
If he finds out

01:15:51.018 --> 01:15:53.722
that she put the money
in his account and not the VA,

01:15:54.285 --> 01:15:55.757
it just might trigger him.

01:15:56.287 --> 01:15:57.792
We don't know.

01:15:57.827 --> 01:15:59.057
Hell, he doesn't know.

01:16:00.357 --> 01:16:02.830
Whoever is talking to her
should tell her to stop.

01:16:02.865 --> 01:16:06.669
In fact, we should kill
all bank communications
except for the phones.

01:16:06.704 --> 01:16:08.902
Kill all comms
except for the phones.

01:16:10.334 --> 01:16:11.366
Let's go.

01:16:23.182 --> 01:16:26.282
I got the phone credit,
but your account...

01:16:29.155 --> 01:16:30.220
it's erroring.

01:16:32.994 --> 01:16:37.227
Why-- Why would they do that?
It just doesn't work?

01:16:37.262 --> 01:16:38.162
Try again.

01:16:42.839 --> 01:16:44.300
Hello.
<i> Brian.</i>

01:16:44.335 --> 01:16:46.236
-Man, why would you--
-Brian, look at your phone, man.

01:16:46.271 --> 01:16:47.336
You're on CNN.

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:50.273
CNN?

01:16:51.111 --> 01:16:53.243
I'm on CNN?

01:16:53.278 --> 01:16:56.081
<i>People are listening</i>
<i>to your story.</i>

01:16:56.116 --> 01:16:58.688
They got pictures of you
all over Facebook and Twitter.

01:16:58.723 --> 01:16:59.854
Mm-hmm.

01:17:01.022 --> 01:17:04.221
Okay, uh,
what they saying?

01:17:04.256 --> 01:17:06.190
<i>Well, they know</i>
<i>that you're angry.</i>

01:17:07.325 --> 01:17:09.325
<i>Hell, most of them know</i>
<i>what's behind it.</i>

01:17:10.427 --> 01:17:13.032
<i>It ain't no secret</i>
<i>that the VA is fubar.</i>

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:17.234
<i>You got them</i>
<i>on the back foot now, brother.</i>

01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:19.676
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:17:20.239 --> 01:17:22.338
So everything you say,

01:17:22.373 --> 01:17:24.747
everything you do,

01:17:24.782 --> 01:17:25.979
it matters.

01:17:32.119 --> 01:17:33.987
<i>I don't know that it does.</i>

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:38.156
<i>It matters. You matter.</i>

01:17:40.226 --> 01:17:42.930
<i>Just make good</i>
<i>where you are right now.</i>

01:17:44.098 --> 01:17:46.230
Thank you for the call,
Hollywood.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.096
One of y'all can go.

01:18:24.809 --> 01:18:27.139
<i>But it does say here</i>
<i>that he owed the college money.</i>

01:18:27.174 --> 01:18:29.141
It ain't,
though it says it is.

01:18:29.176 --> 01:18:30.538
What does that mean?

01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:33.541
Once a student wants out,
stops showing up,

01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:35.884
school tells us
they're defaulting.

01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:39.052
-Meaning what?
-We gotta take their money.

01:18:39.087 --> 01:18:41.219
Pension, disability,
whatever we can get.

01:18:43.025 --> 01:18:45.289
The kicker is,
that wasn't Brian.

01:18:45.324 --> 01:18:46.829
This is on them.

01:18:48.327 --> 01:18:50.360
Why didn't the VA
make it right?

01:18:53.365 --> 01:18:55.398
Give me a pack
of the Newport Longs.

01:18:58.942 --> 01:18:59.974
6.50.

01:19:02.011 --> 01:19:03.780
Uh, you got matches?

01:19:07.082 --> 01:19:08.411
All right, listen up!

01:19:08.446 --> 01:19:10.413
Prepare for
a hostage release.

01:19:10.448 --> 01:19:12.052
Got ourselves a swap.

01:19:12.516 --> 01:19:13.548
Got a light?

01:19:15.519 --> 01:19:17.222
Got matches?

01:19:17.257 --> 01:19:19.092
I know you got a light.

01:19:19.127 --> 01:19:20.896
Does anybody have a light?

01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:25.461
Why don't you, uh,
give him a blowtorch
while you're at it?

01:19:26.497 --> 01:19:28.904
He has a detonator
attached to a bomb, sir.

01:19:28.939 --> 01:19:30.334
Not a stick of dynamite.

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:36.043
SWAT command, let me know
when you're ready
for hostage release.

01:19:36.078 --> 01:19:38.507
<i>32-01. All incoming SWAT</i>
<i>prepare for the exchange.</i>

01:19:38.542 --> 01:19:40.245
Guys! Hey, guys!

01:19:41.919 --> 01:19:42.951
Our bad!

01:20:07.945 --> 01:20:11.276
Now, ladies,
we don't have much time.
You have to decide.

01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:15.115
-You can't put that on us.
It's not fair.
-I know.

01:20:17.251 --> 01:20:19.988
Rosa, you can go. Go.

01:20:20.023 --> 01:20:21.154
No.

01:20:22.619 --> 01:20:24.223
Cannot leave you here.

01:20:27.624 --> 01:20:30.097
You got to decide.
I'm--

01:20:30.132 --> 01:20:33.562
Well, I think it's probably best
I have a senior manager here,

01:20:35.137 --> 01:20:36.873
you know,
in case they try to--

01:20:37.436 --> 01:20:39.403
they try to shoot me.

01:20:47.017 --> 01:20:49.347
As soon as the cigarettes
are at the door,

01:20:49.382 --> 01:20:51.415
all three of us
will go get it.

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:55.221
Estel, I need you
to open the door,
hold it open.

01:20:55.256 --> 01:20:59.555
And, Rosa, I need you
to grab the cigarettes,
pass it on back,

01:20:59.590 --> 01:21:01.062
move off.

01:21:01.097 --> 01:21:03.658
Then, Estel,
you lock the door behind her.

01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:07.035
That clear?

01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:12.403
Okay.

01:21:12.438 --> 01:21:13.602
Good.

01:21:16.376 --> 01:21:17.474
You hot?

01:21:17.509 --> 01:21:19.014
Not really.

01:21:19.445 --> 01:21:21.115
No?

01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:24.349
I think I'm burning up.
Excuse me.

01:22:05.458 --> 01:22:06.556
Come on.

01:22:08.428 --> 01:22:10.197
Come on. Let's go.

01:22:12.102 --> 01:22:13.530
We got to go.

01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:19.503
We got to go.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:25.476
You gotta be kidding me.

01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:45.034
<i> Daddy?</i>

01:22:45.069 --> 01:22:47.498
Hey, Baby Ruth.
Hey. Hey, baby.

01:22:50.371 --> 01:22:53.405
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm gonna be okay.

01:22:55.805 --> 01:22:57.574
You know, whatever happens...

01:23:00.249 --> 01:23:02.150
and you gonna be okay.

01:23:03.582 --> 01:23:05.516
<i>My baby gonna be fine.</i>

01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:08.222
Am I?

01:23:08.257 --> 01:23:10.620
Baby, why would you not be?

01:23:13.724 --> 01:23:17.363
You don't understand.
You're the most brilliant person
I know.

01:23:17.398 --> 01:23:18.463
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:23:18.498 --> 01:23:20.663
But Mommy says you in trouble.

01:23:21.534 --> 01:23:23.270
Well, tell Mommy...

01:23:29.278 --> 01:23:32.213
Tell Mommy
I'll be just fine. Okay?

01:23:32.248 --> 01:23:33.808
<i>Now, you know what we do.</i>

01:23:36.384 --> 01:23:38.219
Can you pray with Daddy?

01:23:46.625 --> 01:23:49.758
If he comes back out,
he will shoot me.

01:23:49.793 --> 01:23:53.201
If he had a gun,
we would have seen it by now.

01:23:56.899 --> 01:23:59.141
Rosa. Rosa.

01:23:59.176 --> 01:24:00.835
Rosa, come on.

01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:03.178
-I can't.
-You the one
supposed to be free.

01:24:03.213 --> 01:24:04.608
Bitch, come on.

01:24:05.578 --> 01:24:07.215
I can't move.

01:24:12.651 --> 01:24:14.882
What the hell
is taking SWAT so long?

01:24:14.917 --> 01:24:16.719
They'll let us know
when they're set.

01:24:32.374 --> 01:24:34.110
"Those that dwell...

01:24:37.742 --> 01:24:40.116
in the shelter
of the Most High...

01:24:42.285 --> 01:24:43.845
<i>shall rest...</i>

01:24:49.556 --> 01:24:51.160
shall rest..."

01:24:59.335 --> 01:25:00.862
<i> Daddy, breathe.</i>

01:25:01.733 --> 01:25:03.271
Okay, baby.

01:25:06.969 --> 01:25:08.837
<i> Okay, baby, okay.</i>

01:25:13.712 --> 01:25:15.745
"I will say of the Lord...

01:25:18.882 --> 01:25:20.816
He is my refuge...

01:25:24.756 --> 01:25:26.228
my fortress...

01:25:30.366 --> 01:25:33.200
my God, in whom I trust.

01:25:37.274 --> 01:25:40.836
Surely he will save me
from the fowler's snare...

01:25:44.908 --> 01:25:46.941
and from the deadly pestilence."

01:25:52.718 --> 01:25:53.849
Amen.

01:25:55.391 --> 01:25:56.621
<i> Amen.</i>

01:25:59.395 --> 01:26:00.526
<i>Daddy...</i>

01:26:02.299 --> 01:26:03.661
<i>are you breathing?</i>

01:26:09.504 --> 01:26:10.734
I am, baby.

01:26:10.769 --> 01:26:11.966
I'm breathing.

01:26:13.277 --> 01:26:14.672
I am.

01:26:15.939 --> 01:26:17.972
Thank you for your prayer.

01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:22.713
Thank you
for praying for me, baby.

01:26:22.748 --> 01:26:24.385
I needed that.

01:26:25.586 --> 01:26:26.618
<i>Daddy,</i>

01:26:26.653 --> 01:26:28.686
can you get out of trouble?

01:26:29.755 --> 01:26:31.788
<i>Oh, baby,</i>
<i>you can always get...</i>

01:26:34.628 --> 01:26:36.463
Just do right by people.

01:26:38.698 --> 01:26:42.238
You understand me?
Wherever you go,
you treat people good.

01:26:44.374 --> 01:26:45.472
Okay?

01:26:46.706 --> 01:26:48.002
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

01:26:53.647 --> 01:26:55.482
That's why I love you.

01:26:57.387 --> 01:27:00.817
You're so cool.
<i>What did I do?</i>

01:27:00.852 --> 01:27:01.983
Nothing.

01:27:05.428 --> 01:27:07.758
Daddy's gonna
let these women out now.

01:27:08.926 --> 01:27:11.465
Then we gonna get my puppy?

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.335
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

01:27:14.635 --> 01:27:16.338
I love you, Kiah.

01:27:18.034 --> 01:27:19.935
<i>I love you too, Daddy.</i>

01:27:45.666 --> 01:27:48.997
<i>75-01, do you need</i>
<i>SWAT commander on your comm?</i>

01:28:07.688 --> 01:28:09.919
Ladies,

01:28:09.954 --> 01:28:14.495
I just wanna say thank you
for everything you've done
for me the last few hours.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.093
And I'm very sorry.

01:28:20.932 --> 01:28:22.668
I really am.

01:28:28.412 --> 01:28:29.972
Fuck this.
We're gonna lose him.

01:28:45.825 --> 01:28:47.858
Even though I don't pray often,

01:28:47.893 --> 01:28:49.992
there's this book
I been reading--

01:28:51.666 --> 01:28:53.699
What the hell was that?

01:28:56.638 --> 01:28:59.441
-<i> Shots fired.</i>
-What was that?

01:28:59.476 --> 01:29:02.609
<i> And you are watching</i>
<i>breaking news with us,</i>
<i>this scene unfolding...</i>

01:29:02.644 --> 01:29:03.973
Go! Go! Go!

01:29:11.048 --> 01:29:12.916
All right, move!
We're moving!

01:29:19.496 --> 01:29:21.892
-Police!
-Nobody move!

01:29:25.062 --> 01:29:26.765
Come here. Come here.

01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:30.472
Ma'am, come on.
Come on, ma'am.

01:29:32.641 --> 01:29:35.708
-What was that?
-I think it was a rescue.

01:29:35.743 --> 01:29:38.480
-Who authorized
the rescue, Chief?
-You had hostages in there.

01:29:38.515 --> 01:29:40.141
Find out what that was.
Was that a flash-bang?

01:29:41.111 --> 01:29:42.913
Where are the hostages, Chief?

01:29:42.948 --> 01:29:44.717
You said you wanted
a peaceful negotiation.
What happened?

01:29:44.752 --> 01:29:46.884
Look, we saw
a window of opportunity

01:29:46.919 --> 01:29:50.085
and we made contact
trying to extract
the hostages.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.559
Did you kill him?

01:29:53.992 --> 01:29:55.695
I have no further comment
on this matter.

01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:57.466
When will that information
be available?

01:30:12.516 --> 01:30:13.614
Yup.

01:30:21.085 --> 01:30:22.590
Mm-hmm.

01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:23.756
Yeah.

01:30:25.122 --> 01:30:26.594
Thank you.

01:30:28.257 --> 01:30:29.729
We're on our way.

01:30:30.534 --> 01:30:32.600
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:34.569
Is he dead?

01:30:35.902 --> 01:30:38.133
You'll have to contact
your local PD, ma'am.

01:30:40.038 --> 01:30:41.609
I have to what?

01:30:42.304 --> 01:30:44.139
Hello? I have to what?

01:30:45.648 --> 01:30:46.779
Sir!

01:30:46.814 --> 01:30:49.716
Excuse me, please.
Talk to me, sir.

01:30:49.751 --> 01:30:52.785
Just talk to me.
Ma'am.

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:54.754
Ma'am. Ma'am.
Did you kill him?

01:30:54.789 --> 01:30:57.526
Ma'am. Ma'am!

01:30:57.561 --> 01:31:00.892
You'll find he may have
turned the weapon on himself.

01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:19.944
<i>Hi. This is Cassandra...</i>

01:34:06.409 --> 01:34:07.947
Bernard.

01:34:09.753 --> 01:34:11.082
There's no bomb.

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:22.423
<i>That must've been</i>
<i>so frightening for you.</i>

01:34:24.394 --> 01:34:26.966
All I was doing, I think,

01:34:27.001 --> 01:34:30.200
was just trying to
listen to him.

01:34:30.235 --> 01:34:33.038
You painted a vivid image
of this man...

01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:09.299
<i> Gandalf?</i>

01:36:09.334 --> 01:36:10.839
<i> No.</i>

01:36:10.874 --> 01:36:12.335
<i> Gimli?</i>

01:36:12.370 --> 01:36:14.040
<i> One guess left.</i>

01:36:14.075 --> 01:36:16.339
<i> Okay. Gollum.</i>

01:36:16.374 --> 01:36:20.948
<i> Dad!</i>
<i>You can't name a dog Gollum.</i>
<i>It'll get to her head.</i>

01:36:20.983 --> 01:36:23.412
Okay, I give in.
What's the name?

01:36:23.447 --> 01:36:26.085
Samwise the brave.

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.022
Samwise the brave.

01:36:31.191 --> 01:36:32.960
That's perfect, baby.

01:36:34.227 --> 01:36:36.161
That is perfect.
