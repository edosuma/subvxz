00:02.041 --> 00:04.476
<i>We're just gonna post
summonses everywhere</i>

00:04.563 --> 00:07.195
<i>for the rats, being like,
"Come to your trial, rats.</i>

00:07.282 --> 00:08.343
<i>You're in big trouble."</i>

00:08.430 --> 00:10.150
Which is so stupid.

00:10.237 --> 00:11.450
But that's what they did.

00:11.537 --> 00:13.647
<i>He sees this guy
beating up a donkey,</i>

00:13.734 --> 00:15.510
<i>biting rats' heads off.</i>

00:15.597 --> 00:17.015
<i>Henry Bergh's like, "No chance."</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:18.127
No!

00:18.214 --> 00:19.475
- Woof!
- No!

00:19.562 --> 00:21.545
<i>He was teaching the horse</i>

00:21.632 --> 00:23.659
<i>to do math problems.</i>

00:23.746 --> 00:26.645
<i>This horse is
a **** genius.</i>

00:26.732 --> 00:30.112
A genre va...

<font color=#00FF00>Season 05   Episode 10</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Animals"</font>

00:45.258 --> 00:46.322
<i>I love animals.</i>

00:46.409 --> 00:48.118
<i>Ever since I was a kid,
I've loved animals.</i>

00:48.205 --> 00:50.015
<i>I mean,
who doesn't like animals?</i>

00:50.170 --> 00:52.653
<i>I just feel like
they teach us so much.</i>

00:52.740 --> 00:54.236
You know
the ejaculate of a dolphin

00:54.323 --> 00:56.374
- can blast a human's head off?
- The ejaculate?

00:56.461 --> 00:58.489
- Mm-hmm. Of, like, a male dolphin.
- Say again?

00:58.576 --> 00:59.895
The ejaculate of a male dolphin

00:59.982 --> 01:01.750
can blast a human's head off.

01:01.954 --> 01:03.726
'Cause it's so fast,

01:03.813 --> 01:05.588
and there's... I guess, the
volume of the

01:05.675 --> 01:07.014
ejaculate is so high,

01:07.101 --> 01:09.578
so... it can blast
a human's head off.

01:12.026 --> 01:13.414
So you have to be careful.

01:13.501 --> 01:16.806
- Don't go out with a dolphin.
- I'm not gonna jerk a dolphin off.

01:16.893 --> 01:17.852
Don't.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.648
Hello! I'm Claudia O'Doherty,

01:20.735 --> 01:22.449
and today
we're gonna talk about

01:22.536 --> 01:24.501
the trial of the rats.

01:24.588 --> 01:26.617
- Congrats!
- Congrats?

01:26.704 --> 01:27.918
To rats.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.668
Cong-rats.

01:29.825 --> 01:31.296
<i>Congrats to you.</i>

01:32.403 --> 01:34.523
<i>So here we go.
It's France.</i>

01:34.610 --> 01:35.996
<i>It's 1508.</i>

01:36.083 --> 01:39.319
<i>Things are crazy
because it's Medieval Times.</i>

01:39.406 --> 01:42.350
<i>France is under ecclesiastical
law at this time,</i>

01:42.437 --> 01:43.785
<i>which means church law.</i>

01:43.872 --> 01:46.173
<i>The church controls
the legal system</i>

01:46.260 --> 01:48.075
<i>They're like,
we're very smart.</i>

01:48.162 --> 01:50.072
<i>We've read
the Bible tons of times,</i>

01:50.159 --> 01:51.099
<i>and guess what,</i>

01:51.186 --> 01:54.047
<i>uh, animals are the same
as humans right now.</i>

01:54.134 --> 01:55.816
<i>So
If you've got a problem</i>

01:55.903 --> 01:57.839
<i>and you think
the animal's responsible,</i>

01:57.926 --> 01:59.832
<i>we'll put the animal on trial.</i>

01:59.919 --> 02:02.905
<i>So they put
tons of animals on trial</i>

02:02.992 --> 02:06.249
<i>for being ding-dongs and for
doing bad stuff to humans.</i>

02:06.336 --> 02:08.228
I guess they had
so much spare time then.

02:08.315 --> 02:10.973
<i>So the farmers go to
look at their harvest,</i>

02:11.060 --> 02:13.808
<i>and they're like, oh, no,
where's all our barley?</i>

02:13.895 --> 02:18.452
<i>I'm really sad,
and I know who's responsible...</i>

02:19.680 --> 02:20.675
<i>Rats.</i>

02:20.762 --> 02:23.020
<i>So the farmer's like,
guess what, rats.</i>

02:23.107 --> 02:25.408
<i>We're gonna sue you,
and the rat's like,</i>

02:25.495 --> 02:27.948
<i>go for it, loser,
'cause, uh, we're rats.</i>

02:28.035 --> 02:30.538
<i>No one can really hold
us responsible for that.</i>

02:32.473 --> 02:33.811
So the farmers

02:33.898 --> 02:36.023
<i>went over to
the church people,</i>

02:36.110 --> 02:37.772
<i>and they were like,
the rats are eating</i>

02:37.859 --> 02:39.660
<i>all of our barley crops.</i>

02:39.747 --> 02:41.042
<i>Can we sue the rats?</i>

02:41.129 --> 02:43.003
<i>They're like, yes,
definitely.</i>

02:43.090 --> 02:44.455
<i>We'll sue the rats.</i>

02:44.542 --> 02:45.651
They're so dumb.

02:45.738 --> 02:47.448
Let's be nice about them,
'cause they were dumb

02:47.535 --> 02:48.554
- from our perspective...
- They're not gonna

02:48.641 --> 02:50.903
see this show.
It's fine.

02:51.143 --> 02:54.250
<i>And they're like, who
will we make the lawyer</i>

02:54.337 --> 02:55.729
<i>for the rats,</i>

02:55.816 --> 02:58.956
<i>because the rats
deserve a public defender.</i>

02:59.043 --> 03:01.341
<i>We're not crazy.</i>

03:03.195 --> 03:06.950
<i>And then they got
Bartholomew Chassenez,</i>

03:07.274 --> 03:09.657
<i>and they're like, guess what,
we've got a great job for you.</i>

03:09.744 --> 03:10.872
<i>And he's like, what is it?</i>

03:10.959 --> 03:13.224
I love being a lawyer.
It's my life.

03:14.123 --> 03:15.696
And
he... and they're like,

03:15.783 --> 03:17.715
<i>you're defending
someone cool,</i>

03:17.802 --> 03:18.908
<i>and he's like, good,</i>

03:18.995 --> 03:20.845
<i>I can't wait to do
a great job for them.</i>

03:20.932 --> 03:23.503
<i>It's rats.
It's rats, mate.</i>

03:23.590 --> 03:25.122
<i>And he's like, cool.</i>

03:25.209 --> 03:26.775
<i>Thank you
for the opportunity.</i>

03:26.862 --> 03:29.857
<i>I'll be there, and I'm gonna
work my heart out for you.</i>

03:29.944 --> 03:32.192
<i>I just love law
and being a lawyer.</i>

03:32.279 --> 03:34.514
<i>So they're like, great,
we're just gonna post</i>

03:34.601 --> 03:36.556
<i>summonses
everywhere for the rats,</i>

03:36.643 --> 03:39.911
<i>being like, come to the...
come to your trial, rats,</i>

03:39.998 --> 03:41.380
<i>you're in big trouble,</i>

03:41.474 --> 03:44.672
<i>which is so stupid,
but that's what they did.</i>

03:44.759 --> 03:46.727
So the rats saw the scrolls

03:46.814 --> 03:48.988
<i>and then the rats said to each other,</i>

03:49.075 --> 03:51.189
<i>let's go get some food,
'cause we're rats,</i>

03:51.276 --> 03:53.178
<i>and we don't know
what that says.</i>

03:54.406 --> 03:56.551
<i>So everyone shows up for this trial.</i>

03:56.638 --> 03:59.927
<i>The cathedral is jam-packed
with human beings</i>

04:00.162 --> 04:02.087
<i>being like, the rats are
gonna be here, right?</i>

04:02.174 --> 04:04.505
<i>We've all cleared our
schedules to, like,</i>

04:04.592 --> 04:06.468
<i>see the... put these rats on trial.</i>

04:06.555 --> 04:08.669
And then the rats arrive...

04:09.350 --> 04:10.985
No, they don't.

04:11.072 --> 04:12.567
Why did you say they arrive?

04:12.654 --> 04:14.088
They don't arrive.

04:14.175 --> 04:15.264
Why did you say they arrive?

04:15.351 --> 04:17.632
To, like,
create dramatic tension.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.930
- I got so excited...
- Mm-hmm.

04:19.017 --> 04:21.471
Picturing rats coming in to a trial.

04:21.559 --> 04:22.713
They didn't come.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.603
<i>The rats, meanwhile,
they're just like,</i>

04:24.690 --> 04:26.653
<i>we care about two things,</i>

04:26.857 --> 04:28.643
<i>being alive...</i>

04:30.316 --> 04:31.780
<i>Chompin' on cheese.</i>

04:31.867 --> 04:34.607
<i>They're the two things,
that's all they care about.</i>

04:35.368 --> 04:38.302
<i>The judge is like, this isn't good.</i>

04:38.389 --> 04:39.728
<i>There's no rats here.</i>

04:39.815 --> 04:41.602
<i>This... we're going to
be... we're going to...</i>

04:41.689 --> 04:44.130
<i>the rats are gonna be held
in contempt of the court.</i>

04:44.217 --> 04:46.627
<i>And then
Bartholomew Chassenez,</i>

04:46.714 --> 04:49.603
<i>he's like, I'll tell you
why the rats aren't here,</i>

04:49.690 --> 04:51.796
<i>'cause the rats,
they live on their own.</i>

04:51.883 --> 04:54.280
<i>They're not just,
like, all in one place.</i>

04:54.367 --> 04:56.138
<i>If you want the rats to come,</i>

04:56.225 --> 04:58.854
<i>you have to deliver
summons to every rat.</i>

04:58.941 --> 05:00.778
<i>And the bishop and the clergy</i>

05:00.865 --> 05:03.012
had a chat, and were...
they were like,

05:03.099 --> 05:04.489
<i>He's right.</i>

05:04.719 --> 05:06.640
<i>We'll set another trial date,</i>

05:06.751 --> 05:09.692
<i>and we'll deliver a summons
to every single rat.</i>

05:09.779 --> 05:13.177
<i>They put up
millions of summonses.</i>

05:13.334 --> 05:16.325
<i>The rats see the summonses,
and they're like...</i>

05:16.617 --> 05:19.551
<i>I don't think
we're gonna come, again,</i>

05:19.638 --> 05:21.505
<i>'cause we're rats.</i>

05:23.347 --> 05:24.876
So everyone's come again.

05:24.963 --> 05:27.728
<i>They've cleared their schedules.
They've come to court again,</i>

05:27.815 --> 05:30.294
and then, guess what,
the rats don't come again

05:30.381 --> 05:31.780
because they're rats.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.224
They don't understand language,

05:34.486 --> 05:37.008
and they just... they don't want to.

05:37.298 --> 05:38.653
<i>And they're waiting,
and Chassenez is like,</i>

05:38.740 --> 05:40.114
<i>What am I gonna say?</i>

05:40.201 --> 05:42.786
<i>I want everyone to know
I'm such a good lawyer.</i>

05:43.131 --> 05:45.255
<i>And he was like... and he thought of it.</i>

05:45.342 --> 05:47.122
He thought of such a good defense.

05:47.226 --> 05:49.268
<i>Guess what.</i>

05:49.433 --> 05:52.933
<i>Uh-uh.
Rats can't come right now,</i>

05:53.020 --> 05:55.533
<i>because it's daytime for rats,</i>

05:55.620 --> 05:57.500
<i>and right now,</i>

05:57.587 --> 06:01.428
<i>their official enemy,
cats, would get them,</i>

06:01.515 --> 06:03.643
<i>and they'd be mortally wounded</i>

06:03.730 --> 06:06.547
<i>and they couldn't defend
themselves in court of law.</i>

06:06.634 --> 06:08.093
<i>And if your life is in danger</i>

06:08.180 --> 06:09.882
<i>to come to court, guess what.</i>

06:09.969 --> 06:12.522
<i>According to French law,
they don't have to come to court.</i>

06:12.609 --> 06:15.627
<i>If there are cats on the
road, we must acquit.</i>

06:15.714 --> 06:18.278
<i>That's what he said,
and then guess what.</i>

06:18.406 --> 06:19.983
That's the end of the story,

06:20.070 --> 06:23.195
because there's no more
records of the story,

06:23.282 --> 06:24.624
'cause, guess what.

06:24.711 --> 06:29.023
Someone ate the records.
Who was it? It was the rats.

06:29.110 --> 06:31.390
It might have been bugs,
but it was probably rats.

06:31.477 --> 06:34.562
<i>So the next part of the story,</i>

06:34.649 --> 06:37.097
<i>this is how it probably ended,</i>

06:37.184 --> 06:38.980
<i>is, they're like, blah-blah-blah,</i>

06:39.067 --> 06:40.835
<i>French, blah-blah-blah.</i>

06:40.922 --> 06:42.775
Clergy talking to bishop,
and they're like...

06:42.862 --> 06:44.661
<i>What should we do about it?</i>

06:44.748 --> 06:46.257
<i>And they're like, guess what?</i>

06:46.344 --> 06:47.617
<i>The rats are acquitted,</i>

06:47.704 --> 06:49.405
<i>and Bartholomew is like, yes!</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:51.125
<i>I'm the best rat lawyer.</i>

06:51.212 --> 06:52.932
<i>No one is as good as me.</i>

06:53.019 --> 06:55.534
And then, so from then,
he got some great jobs.

06:55.621 --> 06:58.075
He represented a rooster;
he got the rooster off.

06:58.162 --> 07:00.131
- They were...
- Nothing makes a mother

07:00.218 --> 07:02.630
happier than finding out her child

07:02.717 --> 07:04.530
- has represented a rooster.
- Yeah, like,

07:04.617 --> 07:06.513
<i>my son, he's done great, he's a lawyer,</i>

07:06.600 --> 07:08.718
<i>he got the rats off,
he got the rooster off,</i>

07:08.805 --> 07:11.395
<i>and then he got a pig off,
'cause that's what he did.</i>

07:11.482 --> 07:14.028
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo.</i>

07:22.464 --> 07:24.930
What is the best animal
noise you can make?

07:25.017 --> 07:26.927
I can do a duck call.

07:30.088 --> 07:31.230
What are you doing with your mouth?

07:31.317 --> 07:32.779
Act like this is like a little butt.

07:32.866 --> 07:33.873
Yeah.

07:36.838 --> 07:39.087
Have you ever done
this in front of a duck?

07:39.174 --> 07:42.030
Yeah.
Didn't get a huge response.

07:43.273 --> 07:45.154
Hello, I'm Mae Whitman,

07:45.241 --> 07:47.604
and I'm here
to discuss the history

07:47.691 --> 07:50.439
of the ASPCA for animals.

07:50.526 --> 07:51.982
Meow.

07:57.087 --> 07:59.549
<i>So in 1862,
this man, Henry Bergh,</i>

07:59.636 --> 08:02.856
<i>he had been appointed
to a diplomatic post</i>

08:02.943 --> 08:05.241
<i>in Saint Petersburg;
that's when he sees</i>

08:05.328 --> 08:06.957
<i>this guy beating up a donkey.</i>

08:07.044 --> 08:09.130
<i>Sir, what are you doing,
you know?</i>

08:09.217 --> 08:10.390
<i>And the man was like...</i>

08:10.477 --> 08:12.075
<i>I am beating up donkey.</i>

08:12.162 --> 08:13.104
<i>With no shame.</i>

08:13.191 --> 08:15.567
<i>Henry was like,
you can't do that, man!</i>

08:15.654 --> 08:16.867
<i>- The Russian is like...
- No,</i>

08:16.954 --> 08:20.203
<i>there's no laws.
I don't have to do anything</i>

08:20.290 --> 08:23.864
<i>you or anyone says,
because it is just donkey;</i>

08:23.951 --> 08:25.409
<i>- it has no feeling.
- Meanwhile,</i>

08:25.496 --> 08:28.045
<i>the donkey's, like,
weeping, being like,</i>

08:28.132 --> 08:30.934
<i>I just really wish
somebody cared about me.</i>

08:31.021 --> 08:33.817
<i>And Henry was like, I'm
gonna go back to the States</i>

08:33.904 --> 08:37.106
<i>and make sure this shit is
a no-fly zone from now on.</i>

08:37.193 --> 08:38.554
That kind of was the birthplace

08:38.642 --> 08:41.024
of this new organization
that he wanted to start,

08:41.111 --> 08:42.677
the ASPCA,

08:42.942 --> 08:45.806
<i>which stands for the American Society</i>

08:45.893 --> 08:49.306
<i>for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.</i>

08:49.393 --> 08:53.817
<i>April 10, 1866, the ASPCA
is officially incorporated</i>

08:53.904 --> 08:56.292
<i>by the New York State Legislature. Okay?</i>

08:56.379 --> 08:57.786
This guy, he doesn't just stop

08:57.873 --> 08:59.288
at getting a law or two written.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.923
<i>He goes out
on the streets, man.</i>

09:01.010 --> 09:02.002
<i>He'll be like, Stop!</i>

09:02.089 --> 09:03.747
Wait, he's American.
He'd be like,

09:03.834 --> 09:06.149
<i>You cannot
possibly make that horse</i>

09:06.236 --> 09:08.050
<i>walk any more tonight.</i>

09:08.137 --> 09:10.290
<i>And, you know,
the New Yorkers are like, what?</i>

09:10.377 --> 09:11.621
<i>I'm walking my horse here,</i>

09:11.708 --> 09:13.957
<i>and he's like,
there's a new guy in town.</i>

09:14.044 --> 09:15.672
<i>It's me. You're out.</i>

09:15.759 --> 09:17.506
<i>Take the horse to bed.</i>

09:17.593 --> 09:19.145
<i>He's also... be like, oh.</i>

09:19.232 --> 09:20.917
<i>Excuse me.
How full is that cow?</i>

09:21.004 --> 09:23.286
<i>Hmm. That's... udder is
looking a little swollen,</i>

09:23.373 --> 09:25.502
<i>and they're like, yeah, what
do you have to say about it?</i>

09:25.589 --> 09:27.471
<i>And he's like, here's
what I have to say.</i>

09:27.558 --> 09:30.465
<i>And he, like, unfurls the,
you know, law at them,</i>

09:30.552 --> 09:32.723
<i>and he goes, get on your goddamn knees</i>

09:32.810 --> 09:35.585
<i>and milk it, bitch, and he
makes them get on their knee</i>

09:35.672 --> 09:38.148
and milk the cow in
front of the whole street,

09:38.235 --> 09:39.737
and it is so sick.

09:39.824 --> 09:42.380
<i>At this time, there was
a whole group of people</i>

09:42.467 --> 09:45.009
<i>where one of their main
sources of entertainment</i>

09:45.096 --> 09:47.541
<i>is these rat and dog fights.</i>

09:47.628 --> 09:50.660
<i>So, obviously,
Henry Bergh's like, no chance.</i>

09:50.747 --> 09:52.720
<i>Within a year, by 1867,</i>

09:52.807 --> 09:56.700
<i>he'd eradicated
all dog and rat fighting</i>

09:56.787 --> 09:58.668
<i>from the whole New York area,</i>

09:58.755 --> 10:01.114
<i>except for this one little hotspot</i>

10:01.201 --> 10:02.672
<i>called Sportsman's Hall,</i>

10:02.759 --> 10:05.328
<i>that this man, Kit Burns, ran.</i>

10:05.415 --> 10:08.965
<i>He would have his son-in-law
biting rats' heads off,</i>

10:09.052 --> 10:10.559
<i>you know, for a quarter.</i>

10:10.646 --> 10:12.661
<i>They've done tons of police raids.</i>

10:12.748 --> 10:15.485
<i>When the cops come in,
Kit shuts off the lights.</i>

10:15.572 --> 10:18.153
<i>He's got a tunnel
in the back of his bar</i>

10:18.240 --> 10:20.157
where he can shove everybody out.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.036
Everybody was getting
away.

10:22.332 --> 10:24.094
- You just spilled a little...
- Spilled some on the floor.

10:24.181 --> 10:25.093
It's a classic bit.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.371
You enjoy that drink.
I just gave you a drink.

10:27.458 --> 10:28.866
- Enjoy your drink
- Derek, just

10:28.953 --> 10:30.704
- Ma'am. Ma'am.
- Zoom it up...

10:30.791 --> 10:32.853
- Let me do this.
- No, but I was...

10:32.940 --> 10:33.859
What?

10:33.946 --> 10:35.066
Hey, I do a pretty good...

10:35.153 --> 10:37.307
I do a pretty good dog.
You ready?

10:37.394 --> 10:39.142
Yeah. Ready?
What do I say?

10:39.229 --> 10:41.299
Go. Go be a good boy.

10:41.798 --> 10:43.153
No.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.508
No!

10:44.595 --> 10:47.557
Go, go... good boy!
Go be a good boy.

10:47.644 --> 10:48.658
What does that mean?

10:48.745 --> 10:49.934
- Take the trash out?
- It's that way.

10:50.021 --> 10:52.086
Take your shit over that way.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.166
- You little pig-dog.
- All right.

10:54.253 --> 10:56.311
And let me talk about
what I need to talk about.

10:56.398 --> 11:00.250
<i>So on November 21, 1870,
Henry goes down there.</i>

11:00.337 --> 11:03.300
<i>He adopts an English
persona and he acts, like...</i>

11:03.387 --> 11:04.862
<i>'Ello.
I'm here to watch</i>

11:04.949 --> 11:08.057
<i>a couple mice, you know,
meet an unattractive end.</i>

11:08.144 --> 11:09.473
<i>Kit's
there, and he's like...</i>

11:09.560 --> 11:10.901
<i>Wait, come on in, then.</i>

11:10.988 --> 11:12.295
That's
the incorrect accent,

11:12.382 --> 11:13.844
but you understand.
He comes... you know...

11:13.931 --> 11:15.549
<i>He says in his Irish accent,</i>

11:15.636 --> 11:17.072
<i>come on in here,
you know,</i>

11:17.159 --> 11:19.500
<i>we'll get you
a nice seat and a nice...</i>

11:19.587 --> 11:20.608
<i>Pint o' whiskey,</i>

11:20.695 --> 11:22.388
<i>and we'll sit you down,
and you can</i>

11:22.475 --> 11:24.861
<i>cheer on the rats getting
their heads bitten off.</i>

11:24.948 --> 11:26.150
<i>Henry kind of cringes,</i>

11:26.237 --> 11:28.064
<i>and he's like, all
right, yeah, sit me down.</i>

11:28.151 --> 11:29.625
<i>So he's sitting in there,</i>

11:29.712 --> 11:31.534
<i>and, uh,
they release the dogs.</i>

11:31.621 --> 11:34.787
<i>The dog starts ripping
off the heads of the rats.</i>

11:35.395 --> 11:37.193
So the dogs eat rats.

11:37.354 --> 11:39.696
Yes. That's what
rat fighting is.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.638
It's not rats against rats.

11:41.725 --> 11:46.058
It's
how much dog can eat a rat?

11:46.145 --> 11:48.846
How many rats can
a dog eat in one minute?

11:48.933 --> 11:49.919
Disgusting.

11:50.006 --> 11:51.226
- It's pretty *** up.
- Yeah.

11:51.313 --> 11:52.757
<i>And then finally,
he's like, this.</i>

11:52.844 --> 11:54.552
<i>We gotta
get the cops in here.</i>

11:54.950 --> 11:57.396
<i>You know,
he speaks into his little...</i>

11:57.638 --> 12:00.320
Technology bracelet
that doesn't exist yet,

12:00.407 --> 12:02.283
<i>and he's like,
go, go, go. Get in here.</i>

12:02.370 --> 12:05.755
<i>And so, like, the cops
all come, and, of course,</i>

12:05.842 --> 12:08.346
<i>all the people that go
to these things are like,</i>

12:08.433 --> 12:11.365
<i>oh, well, excuse us,
we'll just run to the tunnel.</i>

12:11.452 --> 12:13.685
<i>Not this time...
Bergh had cops stationed</i>

12:13.772 --> 12:16.150
<i>at the outside of the tunnel
and at the entrance.</i>

12:16.237 --> 12:18.747
<i>Kit's like, ha-ha,
I've dealt with this before,</i>

12:18.834 --> 12:20.828
<i>but
when he goes to shut off the lights,</i>

12:20.915 --> 12:23.447
<i>Henry pulls out
from his giant coat</i>

12:23.534 --> 12:24.761
<i>a lantern. Aha!</i>

12:24.848 --> 12:27.362
And he kind of, like,
puts it in everybody's faces,

12:27.449 --> 12:28.982
<i>and he's like,
you're going down,</i>

12:29.069 --> 12:30.813
<i>and you're going down,
and you're going down,</i>

12:30.900 --> 12:32.564
<i>and you're definitely going down,</i>

12:32.651 --> 12:35.070
kind of wiggling
the lantern in their face.

12:35.157 --> 12:36.990
<i>Henry Bergh made a statement:</i>

12:37.077 --> 12:38.372
<i>We're not gonna take it.</i>

12:38.459 --> 12:40.143
<i>We're not gonna let you treat</i>

12:40.230 --> 12:41.739
<i>animals this way anymore.</i>

12:41.826 --> 12:43.942
<i>Um, they are
to be respected</i>

12:44.029 --> 12:47.066
<i>and to be treated well,
and to this day,</i>

12:47.153 --> 12:48.949
<i>the ASPCA is still, like,</i>

12:49.036 --> 12:51.180
<i>the leading organization in
protecting animals' rights,</i>

12:51.267 --> 12:54.844
<i>and so... he's my Man Crush Monday.</i>

12:55.022 --> 12:56.364
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.</i>

12:56.451 --> 12:59.250
- It's Friday.
- Is it?

12:59.396 --> 13:02.188
I love drinking,
and I love history.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.500
Is there anything left?

13:04.587 --> 13:06.600
- No.
- No, right?

13:07.654 --> 13:10.723
- Thank you, Mae.
- Love you.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.313
Mae Mae!

13:13.184 --> 13:14.282
Cheers.

13:15.343 --> 13:17.055
There a French fry in there?

13:17.255 --> 13:21.477
Mm... Yeah.

13:23.368 --> 13:24.887
Stay tuned for more

13:24.974 --> 13:27.461
"Drunk History Animals."

13:28.136 --> 13:29.351
Roar!

13:29.438 --> 13:31.715
Oh, I...
I didn't know what to do.

13:31.802 --> 13:32.875
That was dumb.

13:37.171 --> 13:38.499
<i>Now, what's your favorite animal?</i>

13:38.586 --> 13:40.121
My name is Rich Fulcher,

13:40.208 --> 13:42.337
and if I were to marry
one animal,

13:42.424 --> 13:43.811
it'd be a sheep.

13:43.898 --> 13:46.809
Why? What... what is it
about sheep that you love?

13:46.896 --> 13:48.875
They're so available.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.509
Hello. I'm Rich Fulcher

13:51.596 --> 13:53.640
and today,
we're going to talk about

13:53.727 --> 13:56.571
a smart-ass horse.

13:58.033 --> 14:03.264
<i>Our story begins in 1891,
in Berlin.</i>

14:03.351 --> 14:06.117
<i>Wilhelm von Osten
is a high school...</i>

14:06.204 --> 14:07.948
<i>animal teacher.</i>

14:08.035 --> 14:10.744
No, Wilhelm van Osten
is a high school

14:10.831 --> 14:13.383
<i>math teacher
who loves animals.</i>

14:13.470 --> 14:17.194
<i>He says,
I love animals so much.</i>

14:17.281 --> 14:19.576
<i>I'm gonna prove
animals are intelligent</i>

14:19.663 --> 14:22.151
<i>by teaching them math.</i>

14:22.469 --> 14:24.031
First, he says,

14:24.118 --> 14:25.947
<i>I think I'll try a cat.</i>

14:26.034 --> 14:30.219
<i>Meow, uh,
two plus meow.</i>

14:30.306 --> 14:32.136
<i>Yeah, forget it.</i>

14:32.223 --> 14:34.225
Then he tries a bear.

14:34.312 --> 14:36.146
<i>Roar.</i>

14:36.233 --> 14:38.281
<i>Roar, agh, agh.</i>

14:38.368 --> 14:41.102
<i>I just want garbage.</i>

14:41.903 --> 14:45.433
<i>Then he finds this horse
named Hans.</i>

14:45.520 --> 14:47.724
<i>And he goes, horses!</i>

14:47.811 --> 14:51.559
<i>That's the way to go!
Horses!</i>

14:51.646 --> 14:57.292
<i>So van Osten starts teaching
the horse to tap out numbers.</i>

14:57.379 --> 14:59.533
<i>Tap, tap, tap.</i>

14:59.620 --> 15:00.880
<i>That's three.</i>

15:00.967 --> 15:02.721
<i>Tap, tap, tap, tap.</i>

15:02.808 --> 15:05.141
That's more than three.

15:05.245 --> 15:08.662
Van Osten
starts teaching the horse

15:08.749 --> 15:10.544
<i>simple math problems.</i>

15:10.631 --> 15:14.162
<i>He would do eight minus two.</i>

15:14.249 --> 15:16.557
<i>Two, three,</i>

15:16.804 --> 15:18.600
four, five,

15:18.687 --> 15:19.661
<i>six.</i>

15:19.748 --> 15:21.549
<i>And van Osten is like,</i>

15:21.636 --> 15:26.035
<i>oh, my God, this horse
is a genius.</i>

15:26.122 --> 15:29.277
So van Osten takes Hans

15:29.364 --> 15:31.346
<i>on a tour of Germany.</i>

15:31.433 --> 15:32.817
<i>Step right up!</i>

15:32.904 --> 15:36.317
<i>See the amazing horse that can do math.</i>

15:36.404 --> 15:39.834
<i>And the crowds are loving
Clever Hans.</i>

15:39.921 --> 15:43.766
<i>Like, oh, my God, this
horse can do clever math.</i>

15:43.853 --> 15:46.956
<i>This is the horse,
of course, of course.</i>

15:47.043 --> 15:52.157
<i>This horse is so much better
than our wedding present.</i>

15:52.389 --> 15:56.283
Some people in the
audience didn't believe it.

15:56.370 --> 15:58.487
<i>And they're going,
this is a trick.</i>

15:58.574 --> 16:00.048
<i>That's not real.</i>

16:00.135 --> 16:05.053
<i>This argument over Clever
Hans got so intense,</i>

16:05.140 --> 16:08.169
<i>Germany said, we're gonna create</i>

16:08.256 --> 16:11.008
<i>a commission to investigate this.</i>

16:11.095 --> 16:14.952
<i>So they tested Clever Hans
without van Osten present.</i>

16:15.039 --> 16:18.513
And Clever Hans answered
all the questions.

16:18.600 --> 16:23.002
<i>The commission was like,
this horse is the real deal,</i>

16:23.089 --> 16:26.156
<i>and he's counting like a pro.</i>

16:26.243 --> 16:31.162
<i>But this psychologist,
whose name was Oskar Pfungst,</i>

16:31.249 --> 16:34.399
<i>he was still suspicious of Cloz...</i>

16:34.486 --> 16:35.631
Clozer Hans.

16:35.718 --> 16:37.260
<i>I still don't think</i>

16:37.347 --> 16:39.142
<i>this horse is doing math.</i>

16:39.229 --> 16:42.035
<i>I'm gonna run
some tests of my own.</i>

16:42.122 --> 16:45.993
<i>So he puts Clever Hans
in front of a chalkboard,</i>

16:46.080 --> 16:49.278
<i>and he says,
move back, Hans, back up.</i>

16:49.365 --> 16:50.540
<i>Come on, man.</i>

16:50.627 --> 16:52.935
<i>And Hans moves back.</i>

16:53.101 --> 16:57.632
<i>So Oskar writes an
equation on the board,</i>

16:57.719 --> 17:00.088
<i>like six minus three,</i>

17:00.175 --> 17:03.436
<i>and Hans stomps out five.</i>

17:06.449 --> 17:09.464
<i>Oskar gets like, uh!</i>

17:09.551 --> 17:13.070
<i>Something is not going
a right that.</i>

17:18.311 --> 17:19.647
You okay?

17:21.353 --> 17:22.647
Rich?

17:23.031 --> 17:26.247
Something is not right here.

17:26.334 --> 17:28.565
The farther away he gets,

17:28.652 --> 17:31.753
the worse
he gets at answering.

17:31.840 --> 17:36.693
<i>So he decides to put on
a horse costume himself.</i>

17:36.780 --> 17:38.927
<i>He invites people in.</i>

17:39.014 --> 17:41.501
<i>He says come on.
Teach me.</i>

17:41.588 --> 17:43.131
<i>I'm a horse.</i>

17:43.422 --> 17:46.428
<i>He starts to see something.</i>

17:50.293 --> 17:53.085
Like, ooh.

17:53.628 --> 17:56.108
<i>Oh, I see
what's happening here.</i>

17:56.195 --> 17:58.913
<i>Someone is giving...</i>

17:59.784 --> 18:01.132
Fugul.

18:01.290 --> 18:02.523
Fugul?

18:03.772 --> 18:05.085
Fugul.

18:05.987 --> 18:08.235
- Fugul.
- No, sorry.

18:08.322 --> 18:10.136
<i>Oskar realizes</i>

18:10.223 --> 18:12.300
<i>he's not really doing math at all.</i>

18:12.387 --> 18:16.361
<i>He's responding
to people's facial cues.</i>

18:16.448 --> 18:21.163
<i>He's just, mmm, going
through the motions.</i>

18:24.660 --> 18:26.022
If you could teach
a horse anything,

18:26.109 --> 18:29.670
- what would you teach it?
- How to go to water.

18:32.616 --> 18:34.895
They don't know
how to go to water.

18:35.060 --> 18:38.069
They are just, like, clueless.

18:38.658 --> 18:42.428
<i>Oskar announces to the
world his discovery.</i>

18:42.554 --> 18:44.508
<i>He's not doing math,</i>

18:44.782 --> 18:48.780
<i>but he's doing something
