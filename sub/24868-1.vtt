00:12.833 --> 00:14.083
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, man, I'm Kevin Smith.</font>

00:14.167 --> 00:17.167
<font color="#ffff00">And moments after we shot
the show you're about to watch,</font>

00:17.250 --> 00:22.500
<font color="#ffff00">I came into this room downstairs
at the theater in Glendale,</font>

00:22.584 --> 00:24.250
<font color="#ffff00">and had a massive heart attack.</font>

00:24.333 --> 00:25.916
<font color="#ffff00">They talk about, like,
"I killed onstage.</font>

00:26.000 --> 00:29.958
<font color="#ffff00">I died onstage."
I thought I killed that night,</font>

00:30.041 --> 00:31.459
<font color="#ffff00">and I came backstage
and almost died.</font>

00:31.542 --> 00:33.833
<font color="#ffff00">So enjoy the special,
but know that the guy</font>

00:33.916 --> 00:38.791
<font color="#ffff00">who is telling jokes
for the next hour and stuff</font>

00:38.875 --> 00:41.375
<font color="#ffff00">is about to face the infinite.</font>

00:41.459 --> 00:46.375
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm alive to stand here
and tell you that I didn't die.</font>

00:46.459 --> 00:49.167
<font color="#ffff00">Now, on with the show.</font>

00:49.250 --> 00:51.709
<font color="#ffff00">Ladies
and gentlemen,</font>

00:51.791 --> 00:52.584
<font color="#ffff00">Kevin Smith!</font>

01:08.958 --> 01:10.208
<font color="#ffff00">Hey!</font>

01:10.292 --> 01:19.958
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you!</font>

01:20.041 --> 01:24.083
<font color="#ffff00">Stop. Don't. Stop, fucking
don't encourage me.</font>

01:24.167 --> 01:27.041
<font color="#ffff00">Um... thank you all
for being here tonight.</font>

01:27.125 --> 01:29.750
<font color="#ffff00">I had stuff that I wanted
to-- prepared and what not.</font>

01:29.833 --> 01:32.375
<font color="#ffff00">But before we go anywhere,
I have to share some shit</font>

01:32.459 --> 01:36.000
<font color="#ffff00">that just literally happened
before I got here.</font>

01:36.083 --> 01:37.417
<font color="#ffff00">If you don't know me,
you're like,</font>

01:37.500 --> 01:38.667
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh, he's ready to do a show."</font>

01:38.750 --> 01:39.958
<font color="#ffff00">If you know me, you're like,</font>

01:40.041 --> 01:43.375
<font color="#ffff00">"Fuck, he's more high than I've
ever seen him in his life."</font>

01:44.667 --> 01:46.542
<font color="#ffff00">Right when I was getting ready
to leave,</font>

01:46.625 --> 01:49.000
<font color="#ffff00">my daughter comes in,
and she just got her license.</font>

01:49.083 --> 01:51.083
<font color="#ffff00">So she comes into the room
and she's just like,</font>

01:51.167 --> 01:53.750
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey, man, can I use your car?"</font>

01:53.833 --> 01:54.875
<font color="#ffff00">She says to my wife Jennifer,
"Let me use your car</font>

01:54.958 --> 01:58.000
<font color="#ffff00">to go to Target
and get my nails done."</font>

01:58.083 --> 02:00.083
<font color="#ffff00">And Jennifer was like,
"Absolutely not.</font>

02:00.167 --> 02:03.750
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my God, no.
Like, you'll crash for sure."</font>

02:03.833 --> 02:06.208
<font color="#ffff00">And I saw my moment to jump in
and be the good parent</font>

02:06.292 --> 02:08.916
<font color="#ffff00">and be like, "Let her do it."
You know?</font>

02:09.000 --> 02:11.125
<font color="#ffff00">Like, she's gotta try it
by herself for the first time.</font>

02:11.208 --> 02:11.958
<font color="#ffff00">This is the first time
she's gonna drive by herself</font>

02:12.041 --> 02:14.625
<font color="#ffff00">in the car with a license
and stuff.</font>

02:14.709 --> 02:15.500
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Let her do it, man.</font>

02:15.584 --> 02:17.375
<font color="#ffff00">What's the worst
that could happen?"</font>

02:17.459 --> 02:19.041
<font color="#ffff00">And my wife was shooting
fucking daggers at me.</font>

02:19.125 --> 02:21.041
<font color="#ffff00">Just like, "You fucking
piece of shit."</font>

02:21.125 --> 02:24.459
<font color="#ffff00">So... so I was like,
"Yeah, man, let's just let...</font>

02:24.542 --> 02:26.125
<font color="#ffff00">She can do this.
You can handle this, kid."</font>

02:26.208 --> 02:28.125
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Just don't speed
or anything like that.</font>

02:28.208 --> 02:30.791
<font color="#ffff00">Trust that she's a good driver.
You've been in the car with her.</font>

02:30.875 --> 02:34.167
<font color="#ffff00">She's not fucking terrible."
And so...</font>

02:34.250 --> 02:36.333
<font color="#ffff00">Trust that she can do this
and stuff.</font>

02:36.417 --> 02:39.542
<font color="#ffff00">So, you know, I was like,
"All right, man. Have fun."</font>

02:39.625 --> 02:41.875
<font color="#ffff00">And I stood at the front door
and watched her pull away</font>

02:41.958 --> 02:44.125
<font color="#ffff00">and stuff,
which was nerve-racking</font>

02:44.208 --> 02:46.375
<font color="#ffff00">because she had to do a K-turn
and she backed out</font>

02:46.459 --> 02:47.750
<font color="#ffff00">without even looking and another
car was coming down the hill.</font>

02:47.833 --> 02:50.292
<font color="#ffff00">And they had one
of these moments.</font>

02:50.375 --> 02:51.750
<font color="#ffff00">And you heard skidding
and I didn't know</font>

02:51.833 --> 02:53.125
<font color="#ffff00">which one it was and shit.</font>

02:53.208 --> 02:55.417
<font color="#ffff00">Finally, she corrects herself
and then there's a moment</font>

02:55.500 --> 02:57.875
<font color="#ffff00">where the dude behind her
clearly wants to go faster.</font>

02:57.958 --> 03:00.250
<font color="#ffff00">And my kid, the novice driver,
I'm watching this go,</font>

03:00.333 --> 03:02.083
<font color="#ffff00">"Let him go first.
Let him go first."</font>

03:02.167 --> 03:05.875
<font color="#ffff00">But she's my kid,
very competitive as well.</font>

03:05.958 --> 03:08.125
<font color="#ffff00">And I saw my driving in her.
All of a sudden,</font>

03:08.208 --> 03:11.500
<font color="#ffff00">she guns it past this fucking
dude down the street.</font>

03:11.584 --> 03:12.500
<font color="#ffff00">And my wife is like, "Yeah,</font>

03:12.584 --> 03:16.500
<font color="#ffff00">she's ready to drive
by herself."</font>

03:16.584 --> 03:19.208
<font color="#ffff00">So I was like this
is fucking nerve-racking, man.</font>

03:19.292 --> 03:20.625
<font color="#ffff00">And she was like, "You shouldn't
have let her do this."</font>

03:20.709 --> 03:23.250
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I need a joint."
And so I started smoking.</font>

03:23.333 --> 03:25.833
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "What do we do?
Do we chase her down?"</font>

03:25.916 --> 03:27.000
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, "No, that doesn't
show any trust whatsoever."</font>

03:27.083 --> 03:30.709
<font color="#ffff00">She's going, "I have
Find Friends on my phone.</font>

03:30.791 --> 03:33.833
<font color="#ffff00">And so I can track
her every movement."</font>

03:33.916 --> 03:35.750
<font color="#ffff00">And so I was like,
"Are you fucking serious?</font>

03:35.833 --> 03:37.709
<font color="#ffff00">Open that shit up, man!</font>

03:37.791 --> 03:42.500
<font color="#ffff00">Let's watch this car wreck
in real time." Like...</font>

03:42.584 --> 03:43.875
<font color="#ffff00">So we were just
sitting at the desk</font>

03:43.958 --> 03:46.208
<font color="#ffff00">and I'm fucking smoking away,
watching the screen</font>

03:46.292 --> 03:47.542
<font color="#ffff00">on my wife's phone,
watching this dot,</font>

03:47.625 --> 03:50.916
<font color="#ffff00">like I'm fucking Bill Paxton
in Aliens  and shit. You know.</font>

03:51.000 --> 03:54.417
<font color="#ffff00">I'm like,
"She's all over us, man!"</font>

03:54.500 --> 03:56.875
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause every time the dot
stops on the map,</font>

03:56.958 --> 03:59.709
<font color="#ffff00">we're like, "What's the
fucking story here?</font>

03:59.791 --> 04:02.250
<font color="#ffff00">Did she get in a fender bender?
Is she buying cocaine?</font>

04:02.333 --> 04:04.625
<font color="#ffff00">What is going on?"</font>

04:04.709 --> 04:07.667
<font color="#ffff00">Then finally, it pulled into
the fucking Target plaza.</font>

04:07.750 --> 04:09.459
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "You gotta
fucking text her."</font>

04:09.542 --> 04:11.375
<font color="#ffff00">And she's like, "No, she'll know
we've been watching her.</font>

04:11.459 --> 04:12.542
<font color="#ffff00">You gotta fucking play it cool."</font>

04:12.625 --> 04:14.125
<font color="#ffff00">And we're both sweating
fucking bullets, man.</font>

04:14.208 --> 04:16.584
<font color="#ffff00">And I've smoked a joint
all the way down</font>

04:16.666 --> 04:17.958
<font color="#ffff00">to the fucking filter
and shit.</font>

04:18.041 --> 04:19.083
<font color="#ffff00">All of a sudden, the kid
calls us on the phone.</font>

04:19.166 --> 04:22.500
<font color="#ffff00">And she's like, "I did it!
I did it! I did it!"</font>

04:22.584 --> 04:24.542
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, "I did it.
I didn't get in an accident."</font>

04:24.625 --> 04:25.916
<font color="#ffff00">And we tried to play it cool.
We're like,</font>

04:26.000 --> 04:30.041
<font color="#ffff00">"Well, big deal.
We do that all the time."</font>

04:34.958 --> 04:37.500
<font color="#ffff00">Um, it's weird, man because
the kid's all grown up now.</font>

04:37.584 --> 04:41.083
<font color="#ffff00">She, like, graduated last year
from high school and shit.</font>

04:41.167 --> 04:44.333
<font color="#ffff00">And that was like the moment
my wife had been waiting for,</font>

04:44.417 --> 04:46.584
<font color="#ffff00">for, like, four years.
'Cause my wife used to travel</font>

04:46.667 --> 04:48.500
<font color="#ffff00">with me wherever I went.
If I went to make a movie,</font>

04:48.584 --> 04:50.125
<font color="#ffff00">we'd go, leave the house,
and go someplace</font>

04:50.208 --> 04:52.417
<font color="#ffff00">for a couple months
or something like that.</font>

04:52.500 --> 04:53.459
<font color="#ffff00">We'd pull the kid out of school
'cause she was little.</font>

04:53.542 --> 04:55.167
<font color="#ffff00">It's like, what is she
gonna fucking learn?</font>

04:55.250 --> 04:57.500
<font color="#ffff00">ABC's? Come with us.
We'll show you the real world.</font>

04:57.584 --> 04:58.958
<font color="#ffff00">You know.</font>

04:59.041 --> 05:00.125
<font color="#ffff00">You know, I was like, I started
traveling by myself.</font>

05:00.208 --> 05:02.292
<font color="#ffff00">I started doing more and more
like standup gigs</font>

05:02.375 --> 05:05.709
<font color="#ffff00">and live podcasts, and so I used
to travel with Jen,</font>

05:05.791 --> 05:08.041
<font color="#ffff00">and now I just wound up
traveling by myself.</font>

05:08.125 --> 05:10.625
<font color="#ffff00">Because she stayed home
for the kid.</font>

05:10.709 --> 05:12.333
<font color="#ffff00">Like, I was like, "Why aren't
you going anymore?"</font>

05:12.417 --> 05:14.292
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, "The kid's
in fucking high school."</font>

05:14.375 --> 05:16.791
<font color="#ffff00">Somebody has to stay home to let
her in the fucking house, man."</font>

05:16.875 --> 05:18.375
<font color="#ffff00">So... I was like, fair enough.</font>

05:18.459 --> 05:20.709
<font color="#ffff00">So I got used to going out
on the road without her.</font>

05:20.791 --> 05:24.125
<font color="#ffff00">And then the kid graduated and
my wife was like going crazy.</font>

05:24.208 --> 05:26.208
<font color="#ffff00">She was like, "Oh, my God.
My fucking...</font>

05:26.292 --> 05:27.167
<font color="#ffff00">I'm finally getting sprung</font>

05:27.250 --> 05:30.125
<font color="#ffff00">from this goddamn
gilded prison and shit."</font>

05:30.208 --> 05:31.375
<font color="#ffff00">I was like,
"What are you talking about?"</font>

05:31.459 --> 05:32.958
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, "This kid
is fucking done.</font>

05:33.041 --> 05:34.125
<font color="#ffff00">I don't have to be
the bitch mother anymore.</font>

05:34.208 --> 05:37.000
<font color="#ffff00">Like, I'm tired of playing
this role.</font>

05:37.083 --> 05:38.292
<font color="#ffff00">I don't wanna wake her up
and fucking make her do shit,</font>

05:38.375 --> 05:40.958
<font color="#ffff00">do your homework.
Now she's fucking done.</font>

05:41.041 --> 05:43.459
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna be done,
and I'm getting my life back,</font>

05:43.542 --> 05:44.417
<font color="#ffff00">motherfucker." She goes,</font>

05:44.500 --> 05:47.333
<font color="#ffff00">"Which means I'm taking
over your life.</font>

05:47.417 --> 05:49.167
<font color="#ffff00">What are you..."</font>

05:49.250 --> 05:51.000
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, "You're always
fucking going somewhere.</font>

05:51.083 --> 05:52.958
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going with you wherever
you're fucking going next.</font>

05:53.041 --> 05:54.459
<font color="#ffff00">Man, you're always going
to some fucking rocking place.</font>

05:54.542 --> 05:57.500
<font color="#ffff00">What rocking city are you
traveling to next?"</font>

05:57.584 --> 06:00.750
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like,
"Spokane, Washington."</font>

06:02.083 --> 06:03.833
<font color="#ffff00">And she was just like,
"You know what, man?</font>

06:03.916 --> 06:05.292
<font color="#ffff00">I heard about that shit
on Frasier.</font>

06:05.375 --> 06:08.167
<font color="#ffff00">I'm fucking going with you."</font>

06:08.250 --> 06:10.167
<font color="#ffff00">So she came with me
to Spokane, Washington.</font>

06:10.250 --> 06:13.709
<font color="#ffff00">I had two gigs. I was doing
a gig at 7:30</font>

06:13.791 --> 06:15.208
<font color="#ffff00">and then another gig
at like 9:30</font>

06:15.292 --> 06:16.000
<font color="#ffff00">or something like that.</font>

06:16.083 --> 06:17.083
<font color="#ffff00">So we got to the hotel,</font>

06:17.167 --> 06:20.167
<font color="#ffff00">and I'm not a, like,
hotel snob at all.</font>

06:20.250 --> 06:21.916
<font color="#ffff00">All I care about when it comes
to a hotel room,</font>

06:22.000 --> 06:23.125
<font color="#ffff00">'cause I see a lot of fucking
hotel rooms now,</font>

06:23.208 --> 06:25.500
<font color="#ffff00">is the balcony.
'Cause that's--</font>

06:25.584 --> 06:28.250
<font color="#ffff00">As a stoner, that's where I live
is on the balcony.</font>

06:28.333 --> 06:30.292
<font color="#ffff00">So the room could be
like a fucking crack den</font>

06:30.375 --> 06:32.375
<font color="#ffff00">with roaches everywhere
and shit.</font>

06:32.459 --> 06:35.041
<font color="#ffff00">I will tiptoe over human piles
of shit,</font>

06:35.125 --> 06:38.750
<font color="#ffff00">as long as the balcony is wide
enough and secluded enough,</font>

06:38.833 --> 06:39.709
<font color="#ffff00">I'm like, I don't give a shit.</font>

06:39.791 --> 06:41.584
<font color="#ffff00">I'll sleep on the
fucking balcony. So...</font>

06:41.667 --> 06:44.542
<font color="#ffff00">We checked in the hotel,
great fucking balcony.</font>

06:44.625 --> 06:45.709
<font color="#ffff00">Like it was looking over
a stream</font>

06:45.791 --> 06:48.333
<font color="#ffff00">and fucking foliage and shit.
It was really pretty.</font>

06:48.417 --> 06:49.375
<font color="#ffff00">You can see the mountains.</font>

06:49.459 --> 06:51.625
<font color="#ffff00">So I was like, "I love
this fucking balcony."</font>

06:51.709 --> 06:52.875
<font color="#ffff00">And she's like, "When are you
coming back?"</font>

06:52.958 --> 06:54.417
<font color="#ffff00">"I got two shows, so I'll
probably be back</font>

06:54.500 --> 06:57.041
<font color="#ffff00">at like 11, 12." She's like,
"I might be sleeping."</font>

06:57.125 --> 06:59.125
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I'm so glad
we traveled together."</font>

06:59.208 --> 07:02.333
<font color="#ffff00">And so... and so I went off
to do my show.</font>

07:02.417 --> 07:04.417
<font color="#ffff00">I was so excited
because I was like fucking</font>

07:04.500 --> 07:05.333
<font color="#ffff00">weed legal Washington.</font>

07:05.417 --> 07:07.417
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna get to fucking
do a show there.</font>

07:07.500 --> 07:10.041
<font color="#ffff00">They're gonna let me fucking
smoke weed onstage</font>

07:10.125 --> 07:14.083
<font color="#ffff00">while I do my show. That is not
the case at all, man.</font>

07:14.167 --> 07:16.958
<font color="#ffff00">They got all sorts of fucking
even more rigid laws and shit</font>

07:17.041 --> 07:18.083
<font color="#ffff00">like that where you
can't do that.</font>

07:18.167 --> 07:20.500
<font color="#ffff00">So much so that I was
at the place between gigs,</font>

07:20.584 --> 07:22.292
<font color="#ffff00">I told the management,
I was like, "Hey, man.</font>

07:22.375 --> 07:24.083
<font color="#ffff00">So I got like an hour to kill
between gigs.</font>

07:24.167 --> 07:25.958
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna go in the green room
and make it green.</font>

07:26.041 --> 07:27.167
<font color="#ffff00">You know what I'm saying?"</font>

07:27.250 --> 07:27.791
<font color="#ffff00">And he's like, "No, you're not,
you animal.</font>

07:27.875 --> 07:30.333
<font color="#ffff00">You do that outside."</font>

07:30.417 --> 07:34.417
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Fucking liberal
Washington." You know...</font>

07:34.500 --> 07:36.667
<font color="#ffff00">So I went outside to smoke,
but there were people lined up</font>

07:36.750 --> 07:40.167
<font color="#ffff00">for the next show. I didn't
wanna be like a Walmart greeter</font>

07:40.250 --> 07:42.208
<font color="#ffff00">at my own show
where, you know...</font>

07:42.292 --> 07:46.958
<font color="#ffff00">I'm like, "Hi, how are you?
Welcome.</font>

07:47.041 --> 07:49.709
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, it is me." You know.</font>

07:49.791 --> 07:51.584
<font color="#ffff00">So I was like fuck it,
I'll go back to the hotel.</font>

07:51.667 --> 07:53.125
<font color="#ffff00">Hotel's close,
it was like literally</font>

07:53.208 --> 07:54.417
<font color="#ffff00">across the street and shit.</font>

07:54.500 --> 07:55.584
<font color="#ffff00">So I was like
I'll go back there.</font>

07:55.667 --> 07:57.208
<font color="#ffff00">And I went back
to the hotel room,</font>

07:57.292 --> 07:58.875
<font color="#ffff00">'cause I was like I'll smoke
on the balcony.</font>

07:58.958 --> 08:03.125
<font color="#ffff00">But when I walked in the room,
like my wife had set up shop,</font>

08:03.208 --> 08:06.375
<font color="#ffff00">like in a big, bad way.
She had made the place her own.</font>

08:06.459 --> 08:08.791
<font color="#ffff00">She had, uh,
she was on the balcony,</font>

08:08.875 --> 08:11.750
<font color="#ffff00">she had taken the mattress
off the bed</font>

08:11.833 --> 08:14.542
<font color="#ffff00">and moved it over a chair
on the balcony</font>

08:14.625 --> 08:18.750
<font color="#ffff00">to create this kind of
chaise lounge affair.</font>

08:18.833 --> 08:21.125
<font color="#ffff00">And she was laying on it
like the Queen of Sheba,</font>

08:21.208 --> 08:23.333
<font color="#ffff00">reading a thick-ass book.</font>

08:23.417 --> 08:27.292
<font color="#ffff00">And she had this big-ass
goblet of wine in her hand.</font>

08:27.375 --> 08:28.584
<font color="#ffff00">And the bottle looked empty.</font>

08:28.667 --> 08:32.332
<font color="#ffff00">I gauged her to be about
four glasses into Spokane</font>

08:32.417 --> 08:33.417
<font color="#ffff00">at this point.</font>

08:33.500 --> 08:35.000
<font color="#ffff00">Because she was saying
stupid shit like,</font>

08:35.082 --> 08:38.041
<font color="#ffff00">"I could live here."
You know.</font>

08:40.250 --> 08:41.583
<font color="#ffff00">I've been with the woman
20 years,</font>

08:41.667 --> 08:44.207
<font color="#ffff00">I know she couldn't fucking
live there, man.</font>

08:44.292 --> 08:46.250
<font color="#ffff00">So, you know, she said,
"What are you doing here?"</font>

08:46.333 --> 08:48.167
<font color="#ffff00">I was like,
"I'm between gigs, man.</font>

08:48.250 --> 08:49.584
<font color="#ffff00">They wouldn't let me smoke
at the club,</font>

08:49.667 --> 08:52.208
<font color="#ffff00">so I came here
to smoke on the balcony, man,</font>

08:52.292 --> 08:53.875
<font color="#ffff00">and see you." And she goes,
"Well, Jesus,</font>

08:53.958 --> 08:55.750
<font color="#ffff00">I'm reading my book, Kevin.
I don't wanna get</font>

08:55.833 --> 08:58.916
<font color="#ffff00">into a big conversation
about your night."</font>

09:00.625 --> 09:06.125
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "I don't fucking
need to talk to you."</font>

09:06.208 --> 09:07.125
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I was just
with like 200 people</font>

09:07.208 --> 09:10.500
<font color="#ffff00">who paid me money
to hear me talk.</font>

09:11.667 --> 09:14.625
<font color="#ffff00">So that's fucking cool.
Like, you don't have...</font>

09:14.709 --> 09:16.375
<font color="#ffff00">we don't have to get
in a conversation."</font>

09:16.459 --> 09:18.709
<font color="#ffff00">She goes, "I know you.
After a show, you get home</font>

09:18.791 --> 09:20.167
<font color="#ffff00">and you're Mr. Storytime,</font>

09:20.250 --> 09:21.584
<font color="#ffff00">and you gotta tell all
your stories and shit."</font>

09:21.667 --> 09:25.250
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I have no fucking
stories to tell, man."</font>

09:25.333 --> 09:27.041
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Tell you what,
you sit there and fucking</font>

09:27.125 --> 09:29.333
<font color="#ffff00">drink and read your book,
and I'll stand over here</font>

09:29.417 --> 09:32.417
<font color="#ffff00">and fucking smoke my weed
and we'll be together alone."</font>

09:32.500 --> 09:36.041
<font color="#ffff00">You know. 'Cause that's what
fucking marriage is. Go.</font>

09:36.125 --> 09:38.542
<font color="#ffff00">You know.
So I just sat there smoking,</font>

09:38.625 --> 09:39.709
<font color="#ffff00">and she was reading her book.</font>

09:39.791 --> 09:43.292
<font color="#ffff00">And the problem is when I smoke,
that's when I get chatty.</font>

09:43.375 --> 09:45.584
<font color="#ffff00">So...</font>

09:47.833 --> 09:50.417
<font color="#ffff00">So I was standing there,
I was like...</font>

09:50.500 --> 09:53.625
<font color="#ffff00">I was like,
"Did I fucking tell you...</font>

09:53.709 --> 09:56.459
<font color="#ffff00">what happened to me the last
time I was on a balcony</font>

09:56.542 --> 09:59.875
<font color="#ffff00">smoking weed?" And she slams
the book closed.</font>

09:59.958 --> 10:03.584
<font color="#ffff00">She goes, "I knew it,
storytime!"</font>

10:03.667 --> 10:06.500
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "No, this ain't--
I mean, yes, it's a story.</font>

10:06.584 --> 10:08.500
<font color="#ffff00">But it's not long.
It's very short."</font>

10:08.584 --> 10:11.709
<font color="#ffff00">So I'm only reminded
because I'm sitting here smoking</font>

10:11.791 --> 10:12.833
<font color="#ffff00">on the balcony, it's nice
with a view and shit.</font>

10:12.916 --> 10:15.417
<font color="#ffff00">We're on the second floor.
I said, But last weekend,</font>

10:15.500 --> 10:18.500
<font color="#ffff00">I was in Arizona,
I was in fucking Phoenix.</font>

10:18.584 --> 10:21.750
<font color="#ffff00">And I was smoking on a balcony,
but I was five floors up.</font>

10:21.833 --> 10:22.750
<font color="#ffff00">And it was a city view,</font>

10:22.833 --> 10:24.083
<font color="#ffff00">it wasn't as pretty
as this and stuff.</font>

10:24.167 --> 10:27.709
<font color="#ffff00">And, like, unlike today, I got
this great Washington weed,</font>

10:27.791 --> 10:29.542
<font color="#ffff00">I was in Arizona,
I was at the mercy</font>

10:29.625 --> 10:31.459
<font color="#ffff00">of fucking local weed and stuff.</font>

10:31.542 --> 10:34.333
<font color="#ffff00">So I was smoking on my balcony,
like, "This is nothing.</font>

10:34.417 --> 10:35.542
<font color="#ffff00">This shit ain't
gonna do anything."</font>

10:35.625 --> 10:37.542
<font color="#ffff00">Being a real weed snob
about it.</font>

10:37.625 --> 10:40.167
<font color="#ffff00">And then about halfway
through the joint,</font>

10:40.250 --> 10:41.125
<font color="#ffff00">I was telling my wife,
I was like,</font>

10:41.208 --> 10:42.875
<font color="#ffff00">I started hearing voices,
and I was like,</font>

10:42.958 --> 10:44.750
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey, this shit's fucking good,
man. Like..."</font>

10:44.833 --> 10:47.417
<font color="#ffff00">I got too judgy about Arizona.
And then I looked over</font>

10:47.500 --> 10:51.375
<font color="#ffff00">the balcony and I saw
that five feet down,</font>

10:51.459 --> 10:55.250
<font color="#ffff00">five floors down, rather, was
people on the street talking.</font>

10:55.333 --> 10:57.041
<font color="#ffff00">There was a gaggle of women,
older ladies.</font>

10:57.125 --> 10:59.292
<font color="#ffff00">And they were talking.
And I could hear them.</font>

10:59.375 --> 11:00.875
<font color="#ffff00">I couldn't hear what
they were enunciating,</font>

11:00.958 --> 11:02.833
<font color="#ffff00">but I could hear them talking
from where I was.</font>

11:02.916 --> 11:04.625
<font color="#ffff00">And I started getting fucking
freaking paranoid.</font>

11:04.709 --> 11:06.167
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause I was like,
if I can hear them,</font>

11:06.250 --> 11:09.125
<font color="#ffff00">can they smell me right now?</font>

11:09.208 --> 11:10.875
<font color="#ffff00">Like...</font>

11:10.958 --> 11:13.875
<font color="#ffff00">So I'm looking over and I watch
the ladies cross the street,</font>

11:13.958 --> 11:16.333
<font color="#ffff00">there was a crosswalk,
and they're crossing the street.</font>

11:16.417 --> 11:17.916
<font color="#ffff00">And at the other side
of the crosswalk,</font>

11:18.000 --> 11:18.958
<font color="#ffff00">there's a callbox.</font>

11:19.041 --> 11:20.667
<font color="#ffff00">And at the callbox,
a guy in blue.</font>

11:20.750 --> 11:23.125
<font color="#ffff00">A fucking cop is standing
right there.</font>

11:23.208 --> 11:24.542
<font color="#ffff00">And so my wife's like,
"Get out of here."</font>

11:24.625 --> 11:25.709
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, there's a fucking
cop across the street.</font>

11:25.791 --> 11:27.833
<font color="#ffff00">I'm like, fuck the old ladies,
I should be worried</font>

11:27.916 --> 11:28.958
<font color="#ffff00">about the cop and shit.</font>

11:29.041 --> 11:30.584
<font color="#ffff00">I said, but I still didn't
put my joint out, man.</font>

11:30.667 --> 11:35.875
<font color="#ffff00">Like I just sat there,
I backed up a foot.</font>

11:37.833 --> 11:41.500
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, I'm gonna keep
my eye on this cop.</font>

11:44.250 --> 11:47.333
<font color="#ffff00">So... so I said,
so I'm standing there, man,</font>

11:47.417 --> 11:49.125
<font color="#ffff00">watching, and the ladies
cross the street</font>

11:49.208 --> 11:51.208
<font color="#ffff00">and get to the other side,
and I told my wife,</font>

11:51.292 --> 11:53.250
<font color="#ffff00">I promise you, this is what
fucking happened.</font>

11:53.333 --> 11:54.791
<font color="#ffff00">The cop was facing
the other way,</font>

11:54.875 --> 11:57.542
<font color="#ffff00">I'm on the hotel balcony
over across the street.</font>

11:57.625 --> 11:58.250
<font color="#ffff00">The cops crossing,
the ladies also,</font>

11:58.333 --> 12:00.750
<font color="#ffff00">and he goes...</font>

12:00.833 --> 12:04.292
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like there's no
fucking way that this guy</font>

12:04.375 --> 12:05.625
<font color="#ffff00">fucking smells me.</font>

12:05.709 --> 12:08.500
<font color="#ffff00">I still don't put the joint out,
though, man.</font>

12:08.584 --> 12:11.500
<font color="#ffff00">I'm watching him, and this
is what he fucking does.</font>

12:11.584 --> 12:12.417
<font color="#ffff00">He goes like this.</font>

12:12.500 --> 12:14.625
<font color="#ffff00">And he locks on
across the street,</font>

12:14.709 --> 12:15.584
<font color="#ffff00">like where I am in the hotel,</font>

12:15.667 --> 12:18.208
<font color="#ffff00">and all of a sudden
he goes like this.</font>

12:22.875 --> 12:25.000
<font color="#ffff00">And he's experienced,
this cop, man.</font>

12:25.083 --> 12:27.000
<font color="#ffff00">He's like, "Somebody's
smoking on a balcony."</font>

12:27.083 --> 12:29.750
<font color="#ffff00">And he's going balcony
by balcony.</font>

12:29.833 --> 12:31.791
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm fucking frozen.
I don't move.</font>

12:31.875 --> 12:34.542
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause it's like this reverse
Space Invaders game,</font>

12:34.625 --> 12:38.083
<font color="#ffff00">where he's getting
fucking closer.</font>

12:38.167 --> 12:39.958
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm at the center of it
and stuff.</font>

12:40.041 --> 12:41.875
<font color="#ffff00">And he's on the fourth floor,
where I'm like,</font>

12:41.958 --> 12:44.375
<font color="#ffff00">oh, fuck, I'm next!</font>

12:44.459 --> 12:46.584
<font color="#ffff00">So then he gets up to me
and he locks onto me.</font>

12:46.667 --> 12:49.167
<font color="#ffff00">He goes like this and shit,
and he goes, "That!"</font>

12:49.250 --> 12:52.250
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, my first fucking
instinct wasn't to like</font>

12:52.333 --> 12:53.875
<font color="#ffff00">drop the joint
or fucking, like,</font>

12:53.958 --> 12:56.750
<font color="#ffff00">run to the airport.
I said, my first instinct</font>

12:56.833 --> 12:59.459
<font color="#ffff00">was to go like this,
I went...</font>

13:05.459 --> 13:06.625
<font color="#ffff00">I said, so the fucking guy
goes like this.</font>

13:06.709 --> 13:08.542
<font color="#ffff00">And then he reaches back.
And I'm like,</font>

13:08.625 --> 13:12.250
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna get shot
on this balcony.</font>

13:12.333 --> 13:14.542
<font color="#ffff00">My fucking story ends
with getting killed</font>

13:14.625 --> 13:15.709
<font color="#ffff00">on a balcony in Arizona</font>

13:15.791 --> 13:17.542
<font color="#ffff00">for smoking local
low-grade weed, man.</font>

13:17.625 --> 13:19.375
<font color="#ffff00">And... which did have
a kick to it.</font>

13:19.459 --> 13:21.417
<font color="#ffff00">So I was sitting there going,</font>

13:21.500 --> 13:22.958
<font color="#ffff00">what the fuck's gonna
happen next?</font>

13:23.041 --> 13:24.500
<font color="#ffff00">And he pulls out a phone.</font>

13:24.584 --> 13:26.875
<font color="#ffff00">Then the dude kind of
illuminated</font>

13:26.958 --> 13:29.375
<font color="#ffff00">the whole fucking thing,
all of a sudden he goes,</font>

13:29.459 --> 13:31.625
<font color="#ffff00">"Silent Bob!"</font>

13:31.709 --> 13:34.041
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Oh, fuck!
He's a fan, man!"</font>

13:41.083 --> 13:44.958
<font color="#ffff00">I was so fucking relieved.
I was like, "Hi!"</font>

13:46.333 --> 13:47.833
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, pointing
at his phone, he goes,</font>

13:47.916 --> 13:50.833
<font color="#ffff00">"I want to take a picture
with you!"</font>

13:50.916 --> 13:53.916
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Oh, okay!
I'm gonna come right down!</font>

13:54.000 --> 13:54.916
<font color="#ffff00">Stay there,
I'll take a picture!"</font>

13:55.000 --> 13:57.292
<font color="#ffff00">So I run inside,
I change every fucking piece</font>

13:57.375 --> 14:00.750
<font color="#ffff00">of clothing I have on.</font>

14:00.833 --> 14:02.875
<font color="#ffff00">Everything. I take
the hotel shampoo,</font>

14:02.958 --> 14:04.833
<font color="#ffff00">I dab it on my ears and stuff.
Just...</font>

14:04.916 --> 14:06.833
<font color="#ffff00">Get the scent away.
And I said, I told my wife,</font>

14:06.916 --> 14:09.417
<font color="#ffff00">I went downstairs, I said,
I met the dude.</font>

14:09.500 --> 14:10.750
<font color="#ffff00">He was lovely. I said,
it wasn't--</font>

14:10.833 --> 14:13.167
<font color="#ffff00">It was very kosher, we took
pictures together and shit.</font>

14:13.250 --> 14:14.916
<font color="#ffff00">Chitchatted about the movies
and whatnot.</font>

14:15.000 --> 14:16.833
<font color="#ffff00">I said it was a wonderful
experience.</font>

14:16.916 --> 14:19.542
<font color="#ffff00">I said the PS to the story is
he wasn't a cop.</font>

14:19.625 --> 14:22.750
<font color="#ffff00">He just had a blue jacket on.
And that was it.</font>

14:31.125 --> 14:33.791
<font color="#ffff00">Now...</font>

14:33.875 --> 14:36.958
<font color="#ffff00">My wife, God love her, man.
We've been together,</font>

14:37.041 --> 14:39.709
<font color="#ffff00">last week, we met 20 years ago
last week.</font>

14:39.791 --> 14:44.041
<font color="#ffff00">We've been in each other's lives
for 20 years.</font>

14:44.125 --> 14:46.667
<font color="#ffff00">-Thank you. Um...</font>

14:46.750 --> 14:50.500
<font color="#ffff00">Met... met 20 years ago
last week.</font>

14:50.584 --> 14:53.542
<font color="#ffff00">Next month, it'll be 20 years
since the first time we fucked.</font>

14:53.625 --> 14:55.750
<font color="#ffff00">And that's the more important
anniversary.</font>

14:55.833 --> 14:58.167
<font color="#ffff00">But we've been together
for like two decades, man.</font>

14:58.250 --> 15:00.625
<font color="#ffff00">That's, you know, it's just
to tell you that</font>

15:00.709 --> 15:04.833
<font color="#ffff00">her reactions to my stories,</font>

15:04.916 --> 15:06.292
<font color="#ffff00">it's not like everybody here,</font>

15:06.375 --> 15:08.000
<font color="#ffff00">where I'm like, you know,
tell that story</font>

15:08.083 --> 15:09.833
<font color="#ffff00">and everyone's like,
"Oh, very witty, wild."</font>

15:09.916 --> 15:10.916
<font color="#ffff00">You know...</font>

15:11.000 --> 15:14.417
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, she's, you know,
fucking seen it all,</font>

15:14.500 --> 15:15.542
<font color="#ffff00">heard it all and shit
like that.</font>

15:15.625 --> 15:17.125
<font color="#ffff00">Like, my wife loves me,
I know this.</font>

15:17.208 --> 15:19.584
<font color="#ffff00">Don't get me fucking wrong.
She would kill anybody</font>

15:19.667 --> 15:22.041
<font color="#ffff00">that fucking threatened me
and cut the jugular and shit.</font>

15:22.125 --> 15:24.584
<font color="#ffff00">But she is not what I would call
by any stretch</font>

15:24.667 --> 15:30.709
<font color="#ffff00">of the imagination
a Kevin Smith fan.</font>

15:30.791 --> 15:33.250
<font color="#ffff00">Jay and Silent Bob,
not her fucking thing</font>

15:33.333 --> 15:34.791
<font color="#ffff00">or anything like that.
She's like,</font>

15:34.875 --> 15:37.250
<font color="#ffff00">"I'm glad you do those movies,
they let you run around</font>

15:37.333 --> 15:40.791
<font color="#ffff00">and you get exercise."
Like that's...</font>

15:40.875 --> 15:42.916
<font color="#ffff00">Case in point, man,
we got this TV show</font>

15:43.000 --> 15:45.041
<font color="#ffff00">called Comic Book Men,
it's in its seventh season</font>

15:45.125 --> 15:47.208
<font color="#ffff00">-at this point. Thank you.</font>

15:47.292 --> 15:50.584
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

15:50.667 --> 15:52.333
<font color="#ffff00">Um, I don't tell you that
to be like,</font>

15:52.417 --> 15:54.750
<font color="#ffff00">"Seven seasons, look at my big,
fat TV dick!" Like...</font>

15:54.833 --> 15:57.333
<font color="#ffff00">Not at all.
It has nothing to do with us.</font>

15:57.417 --> 16:00.375
<font color="#ffff00">We follow one of the most
watched programs on the planet,</font>

16:00.459 --> 16:02.500
<font color="#ffff00">The Walking Dead.
So if anything,</font>

16:02.584 --> 16:05.250
<font color="#ffff00">it's fucking Robert Kirkman's
big TV dick,</font>

16:05.333 --> 16:09.083
<font color="#ffff00">and we just surf on it
till midnight.</font>

16:10.167 --> 16:12.417
<font color="#ffff00">So I only tell you seven
seasons 'cause</font>

16:12.500 --> 16:15.500
<font color="#ffff00">to communicate there's
like 80 some odd episodes</font>

16:15.584 --> 16:17.875
<font color="#ffff00">of this show
that you could watch.</font>

16:17.958 --> 16:18.750
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm on every one of them.</font>

16:18.833 --> 16:22.875
<font color="#ffff00">My wife has seen two
of the episodes.</font>

16:22.958 --> 16:25.459
<font color="#ffff00">She saw the pilot episode,
we shot it, put it together.</font>

16:25.542 --> 16:27.083
<font color="#ffff00">I showed it to her.
I was like, what do you think?</font>

16:27.167 --> 16:29.625
<font color="#ffff00">And her review was,
"I can't believe</font>

16:29.709 --> 16:33.041
<font color="#ffff00">you tricked somebody
into paying you</font>

16:33.125 --> 16:38.083
<font color="#ffff00">to be on TV and talk
to your fucking friends."</font>

16:39.459 --> 16:42.125
<font color="#ffff00">Which I felt was
a very strong review. Um...</font>

16:42.208 --> 16:46.709
<font color="#ffff00">Then, like, four seasons later,
my daughter was on the show.</font>

16:46.791 --> 16:48.250
<font color="#ffff00">Harley was on the show.
So I told my wife,</font>

16:48.333 --> 16:49.709
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "You gotta watch
an episode now.</font>

16:49.791 --> 16:52.333
<font color="#ffff00">Something came out of your
body's on the fucking show.</font>

16:52.417 --> 16:54.667
<font color="#ffff00">So..." So she watched
the episode.</font>

16:54.750 --> 16:55.667
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "What'd you think?"
She goes,</font>

16:55.750 --> 16:59.417
<font color="#ffff00">"Harley was a vast improvement."
You know.</font>

17:00.041 --> 17:01.791
<font color="#ffff00">She keeps it very real.</font>

17:01.875 --> 17:06.666
<font color="#ffff00">The show is on a night that
we watch two other programs.</font>

17:06.750 --> 17:10.166
<font color="#ffff00">Like, in our bedroom.
We watch The Walking Dead</font>

17:10.250 --> 17:11.500
<font color="#ffff00">and then we watch Talking Dead.</font>

17:11.584 --> 17:13.083
<font color="#ffff00">And at the end
of the Talking Dead,</font>

17:13.166 --> 17:14.333
<font color="#ffff00">there's a fellow looks strangely
like me</font>

17:14.416 --> 17:17.208
<font color="#ffff00">who will pop up and be like,
"Hey! Stick around for more</font>

17:17.291 --> 17:19.333
<font color="#ffff00">hijinks on Comic Book Men."</font>

17:19.416 --> 17:21.083
<font color="#ffff00">And that's when my wife grabs
the remote and goes,</font>

17:21.166 --> 17:24.416
<font color="#ffff00">"We're going to bed."
And shuts that shit off.</font>

17:26.790 --> 17:28.083
<font color="#ffff00">Now I gotta tell you,
this is gonna be weird,</font>

17:28.166 --> 17:30.375
<font color="#ffff00">but I gotta tell you
this story to tell you</font>

17:30.459 --> 17:31.958
<font color="#ffff00">the rest of the story,
and at first you're gonna be</font>

17:32.041 --> 17:35.500
<font color="#ffff00">all judgy and then I'm gonna
tell you something</font>

17:35.584 --> 17:36.875
<font color="#ffff00">and then you'll be like,
"Oh, that makes sense."</font>

17:36.958 --> 17:39.958
<font color="#ffff00">Um, I have a 103-inch television
in my bedroom.</font>

17:40.041 --> 17:44.417
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, that's not the judgy part.
Here it comes.</font>

17:44.500 --> 17:46.833
<font color="#ffff00">It cost 60 thousand
fucking bucks.</font>

17:46.916 --> 17:49.916
<font color="#ffff00">Crazy, right?
I didn't fucking buy it.</font>

17:50.000 --> 17:51.709
<font color="#ffff00">I would never pay 60--
Now, you can't be judgy.</font>

17:51.791 --> 17:54.459
<font color="#ffff00">I would never...
I didn't buy it.</font>

17:54.542 --> 17:57.500
<font color="#ffff00">It was given to me, man.
I would never pay $60,000</font>

17:57.584 --> 17:59.500
<font color="#ffff00">for a TV. I wouldn't pay
$60,000 for anything,</font>

17:59.584 --> 18:01.000
<font color="#ffff00">unless you could live in it,
drive it,</font>

18:01.083 --> 18:03.542
<font color="#ffff00">or it fucking blew you
until the day you die.</font>

18:03.625 --> 18:04.709
<font color="#ffff00">Like, that's...</font>

18:04.791 --> 18:07.791
<font color="#ffff00">I got a line and shit like that.
No, it was given to us</font>

18:07.875 --> 18:11.083
<font color="#ffff00">at one point. I had done
commercials years ago</font>

18:11.167 --> 18:12.167
<font color="#ffff00">for Panasonic.</font>

18:12.250 --> 18:14.083
<font color="#ffff00">And there was a guy named
Ed Janda who was, like,</font>

18:14.167 --> 18:15.750
<font color="#ffff00">the exec at Panasonic
who was on set all the time.</font>

18:15.833 --> 18:19.208
<font color="#ffff00">He loved movies.
Sweet fucking dude, man.</font>

18:19.292 --> 18:20.542
<font color="#ffff00">I've known him for years
and stuff.</font>

18:20.625 --> 18:23.292
<font color="#ffff00">One day, he fucking called me.
Been to my house many times.</font>

18:23.375 --> 18:24.916
<font color="#ffff00">He called me out of the blue
and he goes,</font>

18:25.000 --> 18:29.208
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey, man. We've got this
103-inch fucking television</font>

18:29.292 --> 18:31.125
<font color="#ffff00">that we're gonna throw out,
man.</font>

18:31.208 --> 18:34.791
<font color="#ffff00">And I remember you've got big,
wide walls</font>

18:34.875 --> 18:35.791
<font color="#ffff00">and huge ceilings
in your house."</font>

18:35.875 --> 18:39.083
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like,
"What a weird fucking way</font>

18:39.167 --> 18:41.292
<font color="#ffff00">to start a conversation.</font>

18:41.375 --> 18:43.958
<font color="#ffff00">What do all these things
have to do with each other, man?</font>

18:44.041 --> 18:46.000
<font color="#ffff00">Is that all our friendship
was to you?</font>

18:46.083 --> 18:48.791
<font color="#ffff00">Square fucking footage?" Like...</font>

18:48.875 --> 18:50.208
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "No, the reason
I bring it together</font>

18:50.292 --> 18:52.041
<font color="#ffff00">is this TV we're gonna fucking
throw out, it's 103 inches,</font>

18:52.125 --> 18:53.916
<font color="#ffff00">and, fuck, it won't fit
in many places.</font>

18:54.000 --> 18:56.375
<font color="#ffff00">But it'll definitely fit
in your house.</font>

18:56.459 --> 18:57.791
<font color="#ffff00">So if you want it, we're just
gonna give it to you for free.</font>

18:57.875 --> 18:59.709
<font color="#ffff00">Do you want it?"
I was like, "Fuck yeah!</font>

18:59.791 --> 19:03.041
<font color="#ffff00">Give me all your garbage! Yes!</font>

19:03.125 --> 19:05.125
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck yes!" I was like,
"What's wrong with it, man?</font>

19:05.208 --> 19:07.500
<font color="#ffff00">Was it assembled on an ancient
Indian burial ground?</font>

19:07.584 --> 19:09.791
<font color="#ffff00">Is it cursed?" Like...</font>

19:09.875 --> 19:10.791
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "No, they used it
for the Olympics.</font>

19:10.875 --> 19:13.125
<font color="#ffff00">It was for coverage
for the Olympics.</font>

19:13.208 --> 19:14.542
<font color="#ffff00">So it's not meant
for home use.</font>

19:14.625 --> 19:17.791
<font color="#ffff00">It's basically big graphics TV
where they point to like,</font>

19:17.875 --> 19:19.292
<font color="#ffff00">'This is what happened,'
and shit like that.</font>

19:19.375 --> 19:21.417
<font color="#ffff00">Problem is it has no speakers.</font>

19:21.500 --> 19:22.292
<font color="#ffff00">So you'd have to buy speakers."
I was like,</font>

19:22.375 --> 19:25.125
<font color="#ffff00">"I'll buy
the fucking speakers, man!</font>

19:25.208 --> 19:28.250
<font color="#ffff00">For a free 103
Fuck the speakers.</font>

19:28.333 --> 19:30.417
<font color="#ffff00">I'll stand next to it
and translate</font>

19:30.500 --> 19:32.167
<font color="#ffff00">for whoever's watching!"
Like...</font>

19:34.958 --> 19:37.000
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Fuck yes, man."
So he goes, "Okay, man.</font>

19:37.083 --> 19:38.459
<font color="#ffff00">Make sure you're gonna
be home tomorrow.</font>

19:38.542 --> 19:40.000
<font color="#ffff00">We can have it delivered."
He's going,</font>

19:40.083 --> 19:41.875
<font color="#ffff00">"You gotta clear your street."
And I said, "Why?"</font>

19:41.958 --> 19:45.167
<font color="#ffff00">He goes, "It comes
on an 18-wheeler."</font>

19:45.250 --> 19:46.916
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Really?"
And he goes, "Yeah.</font>

19:47.000 --> 19:49.250
<font color="#ffff00">It takes ten people
to deliver it."</font>

19:49.333 --> 19:50.875
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "Why?"
And he goes,</font>

19:50.958 --> 19:54.333
<font color="#ffff00">"The base alone
weighs 2,000 pounds."</font>

19:54.417 --> 19:56.000
<font color="#ffff00">Oh!
-So I was like,</font>

19:56.083 --> 19:57.167
<font color="#ffff00">"I don't believe this."
And they showed up</font>

19:57.250 --> 19:59.000
<font color="#ffff00">the next day with
a giant fucking truck,</font>

19:59.083 --> 20:00.667
<font color="#ffff00">pulled this thing out
the back, it looked like</font>

20:00.750 --> 20:04.250
<font color="#ffff00">the monolith from
2001: A Space Odyssey.</font>

20:04.333 --> 20:06.709
<font color="#ffff00">Ten fucking people
carrying it, man.</font>

20:06.791 --> 20:07.625
<font color="#ffff00">They were like,
"Where do you want it?"</font>

20:07.709 --> 20:10.125
<font color="#ffff00">I was like,
"Second floor, please."</font>

20:14.292 --> 20:17.459
<font color="#ffff00">I felt bad, but I tipped
insanely well. So...</font>

20:17.542 --> 20:18.875
<font color="#ffff00">Brought 'em up to my bedroom.
They're like,</font>

20:18.958 --> 20:21.125
<font color="#ffff00">"Where's it go?" I said,
"Put it right</font>

20:21.208 --> 20:23.125
<font color="#ffff00">at the foot of our bed, please."</font>

20:23.208 --> 20:24.875
<font color="#ffff00">And my wife is like,
"Are you fucking high?"</font>

20:24.958 --> 20:27.208
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Yes, but that has
nothing to do with this.</font>

20:27.292 --> 20:28.167
<font color="#ffff00">This just makes sense."
I was like, "This is where</font>

20:28.250 --> 20:31.292
<font color="#ffff00">the TV was,
look at this big, wide wall.</font>

20:31.375 --> 20:32.500
<font color="#ffff00">We'll put the fucking TV
right there."</font>

20:32.584 --> 20:34.916
<font color="#ffff00">She goes, "Kevin, there's no
room between the bed</font>

20:35.000 --> 20:36.417
<font color="#ffff00">and the television."
I was like, "Yes, there is.</font>

20:36.500 --> 20:38.125
<font color="#ffff00">Look."</font>

20:40.500 --> 20:41.208
<font color="#ffff00">She's going, "What the fuck?</font>

20:41.292 --> 20:42.750
<font color="#ffff00">How are we gonna
live like this?</font>

20:42.833 --> 20:44.000
<font color="#ffff00">How are we gonna sleep?"
I was like,</font>

20:44.083 --> 20:46.417
<font color="#ffff00">"We fucking slept enough, man."</font>

20:46.500 --> 20:51.542
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Look at this thing.
This is our god now." Like...</font>

20:51.625 --> 20:54.250
<font color="#ffff00">So if you're in my bedroom
and you're sitting on the edge</font>

20:54.333 --> 20:56.167
<font color="#ffff00">of my bed and you're
tying your shoes,</font>

20:56.250 --> 20:57.750
<font color="#ffff00">you get up, you go,
"One, two..."</font>

20:57.833 --> 21:00.083
<font color="#ffff00">You're on the fucking TV.</font>

21:00.167 --> 21:03.667
<font color="#ffff00">So we have this massive TV
in my bedroom,</font>

21:03.750 --> 21:07.750
<font color="#ffff00">and I've never seen
Comic Book Men  on it.</font>

21:07.833 --> 21:11.750
<font color="#ffff00">So one night, I said that I
wanted to watch it.</font>

21:11.833 --> 21:14.459
<font color="#ffff00">Like, you know,
tried to test the waters.</font>

21:14.542 --> 21:17.958
<font color="#ffff00">And... and so I told my wife,
I was like,</font>

21:18.041 --> 21:21.292
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey, man, um, I wanna watch
Comic Book Men</font>

21:21.375 --> 21:24.167
<font color="#ffff00">on the big TV tonight
for the first time.</font>

21:24.250 --> 21:25.459
<font color="#ffff00">Like, that's cool, right?"</font>

21:25.542 --> 21:29.208
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "Oh, we don't
watch that show in here."</font>

21:31.083 --> 21:34.000
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like,
"I know. I know.</font>

21:34.083 --> 21:36.500
<font color="#ffff00">You know, which is weird
'cause it pays for everything.</font>

21:36.584 --> 21:39.000
<font color="#ffff00">But whatever. Like...</font>

21:40.375 --> 21:42.542
<font color="#ffff00">But tonight's special. It's the
end of the fourth season.</font>

21:42.625 --> 21:45.208
<font color="#ffff00">We just found out we're getting
picked up for a fifth season.</font>

21:45.292 --> 21:48.459
<font color="#ffff00">So I wanna like live tweet
the show from in here."</font>

21:48.542 --> 21:50.916
<font color="#ffff00">Normally, I do it in my office.
I watch it on a laptop.</font>

21:51.000 --> 21:52.250
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I'd love
to watch it on the big TV.</font>

21:52.333 --> 21:53.333
<font color="#ffff00">I wanna live tweet,
send pictures."</font>

21:53.417 --> 21:56.125
<font color="#ffff00">And my wife's like,
"Why do you need pictures?"</font>

21:56.208 --> 21:57.500
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like,
"I don't wanna tell you</font>

21:57.584 --> 21:59.542
<font color="#ffff00">'cause you're gonna fucking
make fun of me and shit."</font>

21:59.625 --> 22:00.292
<font color="#ffff00">And she was like,
"You have to tell me</font>

22:00.375 --> 22:03.791
<font color="#ffff00">'cause I control
the television."</font>

22:03.875 --> 22:05.833
<font color="#ffff00">So I said, "Okay."
I said, "I've never seen</font>

22:05.916 --> 22:07.167
<font color="#ffff00">my show on the TV,
but the TV's fucking big.</font>

22:07.250 --> 22:10.167
<font color="#ffff00">It's taller than me
when I stand next to it."</font>

22:10.250 --> 22:13.125
<font color="#ffff00">It's 103 inches wide.
But it's fucking about six...</font>

22:13.208 --> 22:16.000
<font color="#ffff00">six-three tall from the ground
with the base.</font>

22:16.083 --> 22:18.125
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "So when
you see people on it,</font>

22:18.208 --> 22:19.500
<font color="#ffff00">they look life-sized.</font>

22:19.584 --> 22:23.083
<font color="#ffff00">And I've always wanted to like
watch Comic Book Men,</font>

22:23.167 --> 22:25.542
<font color="#ffff00">and when I came on the screen,</font>

22:25.625 --> 22:28.417
<font color="#ffff00">pause it...</font>

22:34.333 --> 22:37.500
<font color="#ffff00">and then go stand next
to myself."</font>

22:45.875 --> 22:47.542
<font color="#ffff00">She goes, "Why?"
I'm like, "To take a selfie."</font>

22:47.625 --> 22:49.250
<font color="#ffff00">You know.</font>

22:49.333 --> 22:51.083
<font color="#ffff00">And she looked at me
with that fucking look</font>

22:51.167 --> 22:53.041
<font color="#ffff00">of disdain like,
"I can't believe I let you</font>

22:53.125 --> 22:56.791
<font color="#ffff00">stick your fucking dick in me."</font>

22:56.875 --> 22:58.584
<font color="#ffff00">She goes, "No,
you watch that in the office."</font>

22:58.667 --> 23:01.000
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Come on, man.
This is fucked up.</font>

23:01.083 --> 23:03.041
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you think
it's fucking crazy</font>

23:03.125 --> 23:04.833
<font color="#ffff00">that we're fucking this deep
into a show</font>

23:04.916 --> 23:07.709
<font color="#ffff00">that I'm on every episode of
and you don't watch it?"</font>

23:07.791 --> 23:09.041
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes,
"Why would I watch it?"</font>

23:09.125 --> 23:09.958
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like,
"I don't know, man.</font>

23:10.041 --> 23:12.000
<font color="#ffff00">Like, 'cause I'm on the show."</font>

23:12.083 --> 23:13.542
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes,
"Well, it's not like</font>

23:13.625 --> 23:17.500
<font color="#ffff00">I'm in the Kevin Smith
demographic, now am I?"</font>

23:17.584 --> 23:21.125
<font color="#ffff00">And I said,
"You fuck Kevin Smith!</font>

23:21.958 --> 23:23.041
<font color="#ffff00">If you're not
in the demographic,</font>

23:23.125 --> 23:26.916
<font color="#ffff00">it's in you from time to time!"</font>

23:28.709 --> 23:31.916
<font color="#ffff00">And she was like, "I could see
this really fucking upsets you."</font>

23:32.000 --> 23:33.916
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I think it's
fucking weird, man.</font>

23:34.000 --> 23:36.083
<font color="#ffff00">If you were on a TV show,
I would have watched</font>

23:36.167 --> 23:37.500
<font color="#ffff00">every fucking episode and shit.</font>

23:37.584 --> 23:38.667
<font color="#ffff00">But you don't watch the show
that I'm on."</font>

23:38.750 --> 23:41.292
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "Jesus, Kevin,
if I really wanna see you</font>

23:41.375 --> 23:45.208
<font color="#ffff00">fucking cry about Batman
and wear that jersey,</font>

23:45.292 --> 23:47.542
<font color="#ffff00">I'll look to my left."</font>

23:53.000 --> 23:54.167
<font color="#ffff00">So that's a long way
of fucking saying</font>

23:54.250 --> 23:56.292
<font color="#ffff00">that like she's over
my bullshit.</font>

23:56.375 --> 24:00.041
<font color="#ffff00">Like, you know.
This is her idea of hell.</font>

24:00.125 --> 24:02.750
<font color="#ffff00">Like being forced to sit
there and listen to Kevin Smith.</font>

24:02.833 --> 24:05.667
<font color="#ffff00">Like, she doesn't
understand you people.</font>

24:05.750 --> 24:06.833
<font color="#ffff00">So, uh...</font>

24:06.916 --> 24:12.375
<font color="#ffff00">So, you know, when I was on
the balcony in Spokane,</font>

24:12.459 --> 24:17.459
<font color="#ffff00">telling her the story
about the balcony in Phoenix,</font>

24:17.542 --> 24:21.625
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't expect her to have
the reaction you guys had.</font>

24:21.709 --> 24:24.041
<font color="#ffff00">But she fucking surprised me.</font>

24:24.125 --> 24:25.500
<font color="#ffff00">As previously mentioned,</font>

24:25.584 --> 24:29.375
<font color="#ffff00">she was about four glasses
into Spokane.</font>

24:29.459 --> 24:31.916
<font color="#ffff00">So she looks at me
with bedroom eyes,</font>

24:32.000 --> 24:34.667
<font color="#ffff00">and she goes, "You're cute."</font>

24:37.709 --> 24:38.459
<font color="#ffff00">And this never fucking happens.</font>

24:38.542 --> 24:40.750
<font color="#ffff00">And-- but I knew
what it was about.</font>

24:40.833 --> 24:42.459
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Really?"
She goes, "Yeah.</font>

24:42.542 --> 24:46.333
<font color="#ffff00">Whenever you tell a story,
you wave your hands all around."</font>

24:46.417 --> 24:47.250
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, "It's cute."</font>

24:47.333 --> 24:51.292
<font color="#ffff00">So I fucking look at my time
and shit,</font>

24:51.375 --> 24:54.417
<font color="#ffff00">and I've got ten minutes
until the next show.</font>

24:54.500 --> 24:57.292
<font color="#ffff00">And then I look from the balcony
to across the street,</font>

24:57.375 --> 25:00.709
<font color="#ffff00">see what kind of geography
I gotta face to get there,</font>

25:00.791 --> 25:05.417
<font color="#ffff00">and then I start doing
the sexual math in my head.</font>

25:05.500 --> 25:08.709
<font color="#ffff00">And so I was like,
"How cute?"</font>

25:09.709 --> 25:13.916
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "Real cute.
What do you want?"</font>

25:14.000 --> 25:16.709
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "I don't know,
cute enough to get blown</font>

25:16.791 --> 25:18.417
<font color="#ffff00">before the next show?"</font>

25:18.500 --> 25:20.000
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes,
"Oh, my God, Kevin,</font>

25:20.083 --> 25:22.500
<font color="#ffff00">you could never cum that fast."</font>

25:22.584 --> 25:24.833
<font color="#ffff00">Which sounds like another
fucking criticism,</font>

25:24.916 --> 25:27.167
<font color="#ffff00">but it's based
on empirical wisdom.</font>

25:27.250 --> 25:28.459
<font color="#ffff00">This is weird, I gotta tell you.
This story--</font>

25:28.542 --> 25:30.167
<font color="#ffff00">Tell you the rest of this story.</font>

25:30.250 --> 25:31.459
<font color="#ffff00">And all the other stories
are mine,</font>

25:31.542 --> 25:33.958
<font color="#ffff00">but this is my wife's story
and it's personal.</font>

25:34.041 --> 25:36.542
<font color="#ffff00">But like nothing will make sense
unless I tell you this.</font>

25:36.625 --> 25:40.916
<font color="#ffff00">Um, my wife is... I don't know
how else to describe it.</font>

25:41.000 --> 25:45.958
<font color="#ffff00">She's the most easily orgasmic
human being I've ever met</font>

25:46.041 --> 25:47.916
<font color="#ffff00">in my entire life.</font>

25:48.000 --> 25:50.292
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, it does not take much.</font>

25:50.375 --> 25:53.875
<font color="#ffff00">Some people are a lot of work,
my wife is not a lot of work.</font>

25:53.958 --> 25:57.916
<font color="#ffff00">I could be standing
across the room,</font>

25:58.000 --> 25:59.375
<font color="#ffff00">leaning on a wall,</font>

25:59.459 --> 26:00.875
<font color="#ffff00">and she could be on the
other side of the room,</font>

26:00.958 --> 26:04.000
<font color="#ffff00">on the bed, laying down,
wearing, you know,</font>

26:04.083 --> 26:05.875
<font color="#ffff00">a pair of sweatpants.</font>

26:05.958 --> 26:09.709
<font color="#ffff00">And all I have to do is go...</font>

26:09.791 --> 26:13.000
<font color="#ffff00">And by the time the fucking
butterfly effect hits her crotch</font>

26:13.083 --> 26:16.375
<font color="#ffff00">she's like, "Oh!"</font>

26:16.459 --> 26:19.333
<font color="#ffff00">It's crazy. It's wonderful, man.
It's fantastic.</font>

26:19.417 --> 26:21.000
<font color="#ffff00">Like, when we first met, that
was one of the first things</font>

26:21.083 --> 26:22.417
<font color="#ffff00">I learned about her and shit.
I was like,</font>

26:22.500 --> 26:24.750
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh, my God! She can cum
so fucking easily!</font>

26:24.833 --> 26:28.584
<font color="#ffff00">I'll never work again!
Like, this... this is nuts."</font>

26:28.667 --> 26:30.041
<font color="#ffff00">First time we were ever
together, man,</font>

26:30.125 --> 26:31.459
<font color="#ffff00">like she rolled me on my back
at one point,</font>

26:31.542 --> 26:33.375
<font color="#ffff00">like I was trying to make
the moves and shit.</font>

26:33.459 --> 26:34.250
<font color="#ffff00">And she threw me on my back
and got on top.</font>

26:34.333 --> 26:35.750
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, "I like it
being on top!"</font>

26:35.833 --> 26:39.500
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "That's where you'll
stay for the rest of our lives."</font>

26:39.584 --> 26:41.584
<font color="#ffff00">That's still how we fuck
to this day and shit.</font>

26:41.667 --> 26:43.417
<font color="#ffff00">And unlike anyone else
I've ever had sex with,</font>

26:43.500 --> 26:46.250
<font color="#ffff00">she was going buckwild
and shit like that.</font>

26:46.333 --> 26:48.000
<font color="#ffff00">I was like fucking impressed
with myself.</font>

26:48.083 --> 26:50.584
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Is this shit me?"
She's like, "Fuck no!"</font>

26:50.667 --> 26:52.250
<font color="#ffff00">You know.</font>

26:52.333 --> 26:54.500
<font color="#ffff00">It has nothing to do with me.
It's not like I'm walking around</font>

26:54.584 --> 26:58.208
<font color="#ffff00">going, "I sling a magic dick."
Not at all.</font>

26:58.292 --> 27:01.167
<font color="#ffff00">She's just like-- I'm like
basically a scratching post</font>

27:01.250 --> 27:04.916
<font color="#ffff00">and she's a cat, and she just
does shit. You know?</font>

27:05.000 --> 27:07.625
<font color="#ffff00">And then fucks off
and stuff like that.</font>

27:07.750 --> 27:10.500
<font color="#ffff00">So because I learned early on
in the relationship</font>

27:10.584 --> 27:14.083
<font color="#ffff00">she could crank out a few,
multiple orgasms,</font>

27:14.167 --> 27:15.292
<font color="#ffff00">it had nothing to do with me,
again.</font>

27:15.375 --> 27:17.333
<font color="#ffff00">She just needs a warm body
and friction, shit like that.</font>

27:17.417 --> 27:20.292
<font color="#ffff00">So since she could
crank out a few,</font>

27:20.375 --> 27:21.542
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Oh, fuck.
I'll try to hold out</font>

27:21.625 --> 27:23.542
<font color="#ffff00">for as long as I can."
'Cause I get one shot.</font>

27:23.625 --> 27:27.750
<font color="#ffff00">I don't get like fucking
five nuts to bust and shit.</font>

27:27.833 --> 27:30.125
<font color="#ffff00">I get one, I'm 47,
like one a week.</font>

27:30.208 --> 27:32.292
<font color="#ffff00">So, like, at the end
of the day, man,</font>

27:32.375 --> 27:34.625
<font color="#ffff00">I try to hold onto it because
once it's over, it's over.</font>

27:34.709 --> 27:37.833
<font color="#ffff00">I'm like Luke Skywalker
bombing the Death Star.</font>

27:37.916 --> 27:40.459
<font color="#ffff00">Like...  You know.</font>

27:40.542 --> 27:43.542
<font color="#ffff00">Shit blows up and I take
the fuck off. You know?</font>

27:43.625 --> 27:44.750
<font color="#ffff00">Every once in a while,
she's like,</font>

27:44.833 --> 27:46.625
<font color="#ffff00">"You wanna fuck again?"
Like, five minutes later.</font>

27:46.709 --> 27:49.542
<font color="#ffff00">I'm like, "Yeah, man.
Wednesday, let's do it.</font>

27:49.625 --> 27:52.709
<font color="#ffff00">I'll have built it up again
and stuff."</font>

27:52.791 --> 27:55.500
<font color="#ffff00">So I try to hold out
for as long as I can</font>

27:55.584 --> 27:57.750
<font color="#ffff00">because she seems to be
enjoying herself.</font>

27:57.833 --> 27:58.709
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause she can get a few
fucking orgasms done.</font>

27:58.791 --> 28:01.041
<font color="#ffff00">And when I say hold out
as long as I can,</font>

28:01.125 --> 28:04.250
<font color="#ffff00">mind you, this is literally
about four to six minutes.</font>

28:04.333 --> 28:07.125
<font color="#ffff00">She gets a lot done in that
fucking time and whatnot.</font>

28:07.208 --> 28:08.500
<font color="#ffff00">So, you know, I just hold out
until she's like,</font>

28:08.584 --> 28:11.167
<font color="#ffff00">"Will you fucking cum already?"
You know.</font>

28:11.250 --> 28:15.000
<font color="#ffff00">And then I'm like,
"It's my special time." So...</font>

28:15.083 --> 28:17.041
<font color="#ffff00">So her experience
is based on that.</font>

28:17.125 --> 28:18.750
<font color="#ffff00">I never fucking told her
that I could cum real fast.</font>

28:18.833 --> 28:22.791
<font color="#ffff00">When I'm by myself,
I cum like a fucking pro, man.</font>

28:22.875 --> 28:25.333
<font color="#ffff00">Like, real fucking fast
and shit.</font>

28:25.417 --> 28:26.709
<font color="#ffff00">I'm real good at it. Had years
of practice and whatnot.</font>

28:26.791 --> 28:31.333
<font color="#ffff00">So... so she-- when she said,
"You could never cum that fast,"</font>

28:31.417 --> 28:33.208
<font color="#ffff00">this is based
on empirical knowledge.</font>

28:33.292 --> 28:34.125
<font color="#ffff00">But I was like, "Oh, no."</font>

28:34.208 --> 28:35.417
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "I know what
you're thinking."</font>

28:35.500 --> 28:36.542
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "But I can
cum very fast.</font>

28:36.625 --> 28:39.417
<font color="#ffff00">When I'm by myself,
I cum very fucking fast.</font>

28:39.500 --> 28:42.417
<font color="#ffff00">Like, I swear, if you
wanna give it a shot,</font>

28:42.500 --> 28:45.584
<font color="#ffff00">I could totally pull this off
in under five minutes."</font>

28:45.667 --> 28:47.584
<font color="#ffff00">And so she fucking takes
her glass of wine</font>

28:47.667 --> 28:49.709
<font color="#ffff00">and she fucking throws it back,
she puts the glass down,</font>

28:49.791 --> 28:51.958
<font color="#ffff00">and she stands and she looks
at me and she goes,</font>

28:52.041 --> 28:55.833
<font color="#ffff00">"Lay down on that bed
and pull down your jorts."</font>

29:00.875 --> 29:03.417
<font color="#ffff00">Which really should have fucking
turned me off, man.</font>

29:03.500 --> 29:05.791
<font color="#ffff00">Like... but I was like,
"Fuck it."</font>

29:05.875 --> 29:08.500
<font color="#ffff00">I ran over to the bed
and fucking yanked my jorts down</font>

29:08.584 --> 29:10.542
<font color="#ffff00">and just presented and shit.</font>

29:10.625 --> 29:13.000
<font color="#ffff00">And there was nothing romantic
about it or sexy.</font>

29:13.083 --> 29:15.375
<font color="#ffff00">She didn't put on any music
or any shit like that.</font>

29:15.459 --> 29:17.667
<font color="#ffff00">She just got to the fucking bed
and like fucking</font>

29:17.750 --> 29:20.791
<font color="#ffff00">got down and was just like...</font>

29:25.292 --> 29:26.709
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause she's been
through it before.</font>

29:26.791 --> 29:27.750
<font color="#ffff00">We've known each other 20 years</font>

29:27.833 --> 29:29.167
<font color="#ffff00">we've been doing shit
to each other and stuff.</font>

29:29.250 --> 29:30.875
<font color="#ffff00">So she's like,
"I know what this is gonna be.</font>

29:30.958 --> 29:32.250
<font color="#ffff00">Fucking it's gonna take him
forever."</font>

29:32.333 --> 29:36.000
<font color="#ffff00">But she hadn't met
her real husband. You know?</font>

29:36.083 --> 29:38.083
<font color="#ffff00">And she was about to
and shit like that.</font>

29:38.167 --> 29:40.709
<font color="#ffff00">It was very-- it was rote.
It wasn't romantic.</font>

29:40.791 --> 29:42.875
<font color="#ffff00">It was clinical.
It was perfunctory.</font>

29:42.958 --> 29:43.958
<font color="#ffff00">It was almost like...</font>

29:44.041 --> 29:47.125
<font color="#ffff00">like the owl in the
Tootsie Roll Pop commercial.</font>

29:47.208 --> 29:49.833
<font color="#ffff00">Like, "How many fucking licks
is this gonna take, man?"</font>

29:49.916 --> 29:52.667
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Fucking three,
I assure you."</font>

29:54.625 --> 29:55.916
<font color="#ffff00">So she went for it,</font>

29:56.000 --> 29:58.250
<font color="#ffff00">and fucking it was not
what she was expecting.</font>

29:58.333 --> 30:00.833
<font color="#ffff00">And this is the sound
that my good lady wife</font>

30:00.916 --> 30:04.958
<font color="#ffff00">of 19 years, the person I've
been intimate with for 20 years</font>

30:05.041 --> 30:09.041
<font color="#ffff00">made when she found out
who I really was</font>

30:09.125 --> 30:13.000
<font color="#ffff00">hitting the back of her throat
at 95 miles per hour.</font>

30:13.083 --> 30:16.750
<font color="#ffff00">This was the sound.</font>

30:27.500 --> 30:28.459
<font color="#ffff00">It was like I'd fucked
Scooby Doo</font>

30:28.542 --> 30:30.750
<font color="#ffff00">in the mouth or something
like that.</font>

30:30.833 --> 30:33.916
<font color="#ffff00">So she fucking gets up,
she runs into the bathroom</font>

30:34.000 --> 30:35.125
<font color="#ffff00">and I hear her go like...</font>

30:35.208 --> 30:37.333
<font color="#ffff00">Because she loves me,
but not that fucking much.</font>

30:37.417 --> 30:38.542
<font color="#ffff00">You know...</font>

30:38.625 --> 30:40.500
<font color="#ffff00">Then she runs back in, she goes,
"What the fuck was that?"</font>

30:40.584 --> 30:42.417
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I told you, man.
I can cum real fast</font>

30:42.500 --> 30:43.916
<font color="#ffff00">when I'm by myself, when I'm
really putting my mind to it</font>

30:44.000 --> 30:47.333
<font color="#ffff00">and stuff like that."
She goes, "Jesus Christ, Kevin."</font>

30:47.417 --> 30:49.500
<font color="#ffff00">She's all sad, she goes,
"Jesus Christ, Kevin.</font>

30:49.584 --> 30:51.750
<font color="#ffff00">If I'd have known that you
could have cum that fast</font>

30:51.833 --> 30:52.625
<font color="#ffff00">our entire fucking lives
together,</font>

30:52.709 --> 30:56.417
<font color="#ffff00">I would have
blown you every day."</font>

30:58.667 --> 31:01.958
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like,
"It's never too late."</font>

31:06.000 --> 31:10.292
<font color="#ffff00">So...</font>

31:10.375 --> 31:12.292
<font color="#ffff00">So we've been together
like I said fucking 20 years,</font>

31:12.375 --> 31:14.667
<font color="#ffff00">we've been married 19 years,
we have a marital contract,</font>

31:14.750 --> 31:16.375
<font color="#ffff00">of course, but at the end
of the day,</font>

31:16.459 --> 31:17.584
<font color="#ffff00">we just added to it
fairly recently.</font>

31:17.667 --> 31:21.041
<font color="#ffff00">Little paragraph,
a subsection that says,</font>

31:21.125 --> 31:25.584
<font color="#ffff00">um, if I can promise to cum
in under five minutes,</font>

31:25.667 --> 31:28.208
<font color="#ffff00">she's morally obligated
to try to blow me.</font>

31:28.292 --> 31:31.083
<font color="#ffff00">And we call it
the Spokane Amendment.</font>

31:38.791 --> 31:40.417
<font color="#ffff00">I don't wanna paint a picture
of her as like intolerant.</font>

31:40.500 --> 31:42.250
<font color="#ffff00">She's generally
a patient woman.</font>

31:42.333 --> 31:45.958
<font color="#ffff00">Just not with me.</font>

31:46.041 --> 31:48.375
<font color="#ffff00">But she stood by me. My
grandmother always used to say</font>

31:48.459 --> 31:49.584
<font color="#ffff00">like when I had girlfriends
in high school,</font>

31:49.667 --> 31:50.833
<font color="#ffff00">she was like, "They stood by you
when you were fat."</font>

31:50.916 --> 31:54.125
<font color="#ffff00">And my wife has stood by me
when I've been fat.</font>

31:54.208 --> 31:58.041
<font color="#ffff00">And then a few years ago, I
dropped a bunch of weight, man.</font>

31:58.125 --> 31:59.750
<font color="#ffff00">I saw a documentary
called Fed Up.</font>

31:59.833 --> 32:02.584
<font color="#ffff00">And it was about sugar.
And for the first time,</font>

32:02.667 --> 32:04.417
<font color="#ffff00">like, I guess because
they used cartoons,</font>

32:04.500 --> 32:06.584
<font color="#ffff00">I understood sugar's eff--</font>

32:06.667 --> 32:09.417
<font color="#ffff00">Sugar's effect on the body.
And I was like, "Oh, shit.</font>

32:09.500 --> 32:11.459
<font color="#ffff00">So I should stop eating
fucking sugar."</font>

32:11.542 --> 32:13.833
<font color="#ffff00">And I did, and I lost
like 80 pounds and shit.</font>

32:13.916 --> 32:16.041
<font color="#ffff00">-So it was a-- Thank you.</font>

32:16.125 --> 32:18.250
<font color="#ffff00">Um...</font>

32:18.333 --> 32:22.625
<font color="#ffff00">It was-- if you could get past
the fucking desire for sugar,</font>

32:22.709 --> 32:23.833
<font color="#ffff00">'cause it's very much
like a drug,</font>

32:23.916 --> 32:26.125
<font color="#ffff00">and when you quit it
there's fucking withdrawal</font>

32:26.208 --> 32:27.916
<font color="#ffff00">period and shit, where I was
insanely depressed.</font>

32:28.000 --> 32:30.584
<font color="#ffff00">For the first time in my life,
I was like I couldn't</font>

32:30.667 --> 32:33.041
<font color="#ffff00">manufacture a fucking positive
thought and shit like that.</font>

32:33.125 --> 32:34.916
<font color="#ffff00">My wife was like, "That's
because you got rid</font>

32:35.000 --> 32:36.958
<font color="#ffff00">of your best friend, sugar."</font>

32:37.041 --> 32:38.417
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "What do you mean?"
She was like, "Kevin,</font>

32:38.500 --> 32:40.584
<font color="#ffff00">you used to wake up and do
like two fucking fistfuls</font>

32:40.667 --> 32:44.584
<font color="#ffff00">of popcorn-flavored
jelly beans.</font>

32:44.667 --> 32:45.791
<font color="#ffff00">And then you'd be like,
'Where's breakfast?'"</font>

32:45.875 --> 32:49.125
<font color="#ffff00">You know, so she's going,
"Sugar leaving your food pyramid</font>

32:49.208 --> 32:52.459
<font color="#ffff00">is really affecting your body.
You're gonna have an adjustment.</font>

32:52.542 --> 32:54.167
<font color="#ffff00">Like when Jason got off heroin
or something like that."</font>

32:54.250 --> 32:58.459
<font color="#ffff00">And so she's right, man. It was
fucking hard for two weeks.</font>

32:58.542 --> 32:59.833
<font color="#ffff00">Like, it was easy once you got
past the two weeks</font>

32:59.916 --> 33:01.000
<font color="#ffff00">and we didn't think
about it anymore.</font>

33:01.083 --> 33:04.125
<font color="#ffff00">But in those first two weeks,
I would have sucked dick</font>

33:04.208 --> 33:06.041
<font color="#ffff00">for Lucky Charms, man.</font>

33:06.125 --> 33:10.625
<font color="#ffff00">I missed my good friend, sugar.
So as sugar went away,</font>

33:10.709 --> 33:12.417
<font color="#ffff00">the weight just
kind of like fell off and stuff.</font>

33:12.500 --> 33:13.916
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't have to do anything.
I walked dogs.</font>

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
<font color="#ffff00">I walked my dog up the hill.
It's not very far.</font>

33:17.083 --> 33:19.292
<font color="#ffff00">It's like a mile and a half
up and down and shit.</font>

33:19.375 --> 33:21.041
<font color="#ffff00">That's the only exercise I get.</font>

33:21.125 --> 33:22.791
<font color="#ffff00">I do it in the neighborhood
adjacent.</font>

33:22.875 --> 33:25.083
<font color="#ffff00">Mewes lives down the street
from me.</font>

33:25.167 --> 33:26.375
<font color="#ffff00">We didn't buy houses
near each other.</font>

33:26.459 --> 33:28.542
<font color="#ffff00">But he bought his house</font>

33:28.625 --> 33:30.916
<font color="#ffff00">in my fucking neighborhood
and shit.</font>

33:31.000 --> 33:32.417
<font color="#ffff00">Every time we drive past
my kids, it's like,</font>

33:32.500 --> 33:35.167
<font color="#ffff00">"Aw, it's so cute that you live
near your best friend."</font>

33:35.250 --> 33:36.000
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "He lives near me."</font>

33:38.167 --> 33:40.167
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway, Jason comes over
sometimes.</font>

33:40.250 --> 33:42.208
<font color="#ffff00">We walk the dogs together
up the hill and stuff like that.</font>

33:42.292 --> 33:45.333
<font color="#ffff00">And periodically, people drive
through the hills, they're like,</font>

33:45.417 --> 33:47.041
<font color="#ffff00">"Jay and Silent Bob
walk dogs."</font>

33:49.791 --> 33:52.167
<font color="#ffff00">So just dropping sugar
and fucking walking the dogs</font>

33:52.250 --> 33:54.875
<font color="#ffff00">like really made the difference
and the weight kind of fell off.</font>

33:54.958 --> 33:58.250
<font color="#ffff00">And at one point, like my
underwear started sagging,</font>

33:58.333 --> 33:59.667
<font color="#ffff00">because I used to wear
very big underwear.</font>

33:59.750 --> 34:01.875
<font color="#ffff00">Like fucking 5XL underwear
or something like that.</font>

34:01.958 --> 34:02.916
<font color="#ffff00">So that shit started sagging</font>

34:03.000 --> 34:03.875
<font color="#ffff00">because the weight
kind of went away.</font>

34:03.958 --> 34:08.333
<font color="#ffff00">And I-- my wife finally
took notice of it</font>

34:08.417 --> 34:10.041
<font color="#ffff00">and was like,
"This is fucking shameful."</font>

34:10.125 --> 34:12.000
<font color="#ffff00">She's like, "They just keep
falling off your body.</font>

34:12.083 --> 34:13.875
<font color="#ffff00">And what we're seeing
isn't any better."</font>

34:13.958 --> 34:15.750
<font color="#ffff00">You know, so... she's like,
"You gotta go fucking</font>

34:15.833 --> 34:17.583
<font color="#ffff00">get some new underwear
and stuff.</font>

34:17.667 --> 34:19.583
<font color="#ffff00">And if you're gonna do it,</font>

34:19.667 --> 34:21.875
<font color="#ffff00">don't buy fucking
maroon underwear."</font>

34:21.958 --> 34:23.333
<font color="#ffff00">That's what I would wear
all the time.</font>

34:23.417 --> 34:25.667
<font color="#ffff00">I had this maroon underwear,
'cause, you know,</font>

34:25.750 --> 34:26.916
<font color="#ffff00">I usually just get my shit
at fat guy store.</font>

34:27.000 --> 34:28.708
<font color="#ffff00">And they don't give you a lot
of fucking choices.</font>

34:28.791 --> 34:29.958
<font color="#ffff00">Now, they do.
Now, they put on like,</font>

34:30.041 --> 34:32.875
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey, there's a Batman shirt
for you, fat guy."</font>

34:32.958 --> 34:34.708
<font color="#ffff00">But generally speaking,
back in the day,</font>

34:34.791 --> 34:37.708
<font color="#ffff00">it was like "big dog"
and shit like that.</font>

34:37.791 --> 34:39.625
<font color="#ffff00">Very generic but very
"I am overweight."</font>

34:39.708 --> 34:42.916
<font color="#ffff00">So I would get my underwear
at the fat guy store and shit</font>

34:43.000 --> 34:44.542
<font color="#ffff00">and they didn't have much
of a selection.</font>

34:44.625 --> 34:45.750
<font color="#ffff00">It was always like
tighty-whiteys,</font>

34:45.833 --> 34:46.916
<font color="#ffff00">that's what I wear and stuff.</font>

34:47.000 --> 34:49.333
<font color="#ffff00">I don't wear-- the
crimefighters, Jason calls them.</font>

34:49.417 --> 34:52.916
<font color="#ffff00">Um, I don't-- I don't wear
boxers, just tighty-whiteys.</font>

34:53.000 --> 34:55.583
<font color="#ffff00">And so one time I went in
to the fucking fat guy store</font>

34:55.667 --> 34:57.750
<font color="#ffff00">and they had,
next to the tighty-whiteys,</font>

34:57.833 --> 34:59.333
<font color="#ffff00">the mot beautiful thing
I'd ever seen:</font>

34:59.417 --> 35:02.292
<font color="#ffff00">underwear that was colored
and it was maroon.</font>

35:02.375 --> 35:03.916
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Oh, my God!</font>

35:04.000 --> 35:07.375
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna look like Superman
wearing this shit." You know?</font>

35:07.459 --> 35:10.958
<font color="#ffff00">So I took it home and it
was a three-pack and shit.</font>

35:11.041 --> 35:12.958
<font color="#ffff00">And I showed my wife.
I was like, "Look, man."</font>

35:13.041 --> 35:14.958
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "You say I never
change anything and shit.</font>

35:15.041 --> 35:17.000
<font color="#ffff00">But I went and bought
new underwear."</font>

35:17.083 --> 35:18.791
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "Maroon?"</font>

35:18.875 --> 35:20.417
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Yeah."
She goes, "Why?"</font>

35:20.500 --> 35:23.916
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "I'm expressing
my individuality." You know?</font>

35:24.000 --> 35:26.125
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "Oh, my God.
Take these back."</font>

35:26.208 --> 35:27.833
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Fucking why?"
She was like,</font>

35:27.916 --> 35:30.000
<font color="#ffff00">"Maroon underwear, Kevin?
I get a vote in this.</font>

35:30.083 --> 35:32.459
<font color="#ffff00">I'm the only one that sees
your fucking underwear."</font>

35:32.542 --> 35:33.333
<font color="#ffff00">You know. I was like,
"All right."</font>

35:33.417 --> 35:35.417
<font color="#ffff00">So I went back
to the fat guy store.</font>

35:35.500 --> 35:38.375
<font color="#ffff00">I bought 12 more pair.
Fuck her. So...</font>

35:41.083 --> 35:43.625
<font color="#ffff00">And every time we would
get intimate and shit,</font>

35:43.709 --> 35:46.000
<font color="#ffff00">she's like open up my drawer
and be like, "Ugh! Maroon!"</font>

35:46.083 --> 35:49.916
<font color="#ffff00">You know? It was a hurdle
to get through and shit.</font>

35:50.000 --> 35:52.417
<font color="#ffff00">So she was saying, "If you're
gonna get new underwear,</font>

35:52.500 --> 35:55.250
<font color="#ffff00">don't fucking get maroon."
I was like, "Maroon forever,"</font>

35:55.333 --> 35:56.709
<font color="#ffff00">and shit.</font>

35:56.791 --> 35:58.500
<font color="#ffff00">So I was out on the road.
Where was I?</font>

35:58.584 --> 36:01.208
<font color="#ffff00">I was in Kansas City.</font>

36:01.292 --> 36:04.208
<font color="#ffff00">And so I had a little time
down between gigs and whatnot.</font>

36:04.292 --> 36:05.292
<font color="#ffff00">So I was like,
I'm gonna go out shopping.</font>

36:05.375 --> 36:08.125
<font color="#ffff00">And I asked them at the
front desk, I was like,</font>

36:08.208 --> 36:09.250
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey, man, where do you got--
where do you got like</font>

36:09.333 --> 36:12.459
<font color="#ffff00">the fat guy store?"
They're like, "Oh, you want</font>

36:12.542 --> 36:14.000
<font color="#ffff00">to go to the
low-end strip mall."</font>

36:14.083 --> 36:17.333
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Brother, I live
at the low-end strip mall, man."</font>

36:17.417 --> 36:18.833
<font color="#ffff00">And I took a car there.</font>

36:18.916 --> 36:21.417
<font color="#ffff00">I walked in and I was looking
for my maroons.</font>

36:21.500 --> 36:23.250
<font color="#ffff00">And I found them.
And then I saw</font>

36:23.333 --> 36:24.459
<font color="#ffff00">the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen</font>

36:24.542 --> 36:27.667
<font color="#ffff00">in a fat guy store:
a pair of black underwear.</font>

36:27.750 --> 36:29.875
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Oh!
I'm gonna look like Batman!"</font>

36:29.958 --> 36:33.459
<font color="#ffff00">You know, and I fucking...</font>

36:33.542 --> 36:34.667
<font color="#ffff00">So I bought it
and I took it back</font>

36:34.750 --> 36:36.500
<font color="#ffff00">to the hotel room
and stuff like that.</font>

36:36.584 --> 36:37.833
<font color="#ffff00">I was happy with my
fucking purchase.</font>

36:37.916 --> 36:40.916
<font color="#ffff00">And so, you know,
I thought of my wife</font>

36:41.000 --> 36:42.875
<font color="#ffff00">and I was just like,
"Oh, fuck. I'm gonna tell her."</font>

36:42.958 --> 36:44.167
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "Hey, man.
Guess what I did today?"</font>

36:44.250 --> 36:46.833
<font color="#ffff00">You know, I was texting her.
She's like, "What?"</font>

36:46.916 --> 36:48.667
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I went
underwear shopping."</font>

36:48.750 --> 36:52.208
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "Oh, great.
More maroon."</font>

36:52.292 --> 36:54.333
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "No, not maroon."</font>

36:54.417 --> 36:57.875
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "What color?"
And I wrote, "Black!"</font>

36:57.958 --> 37:00.417
<font color="#ffff00">A lot of exclamation points
and stuff.</font>

37:00.500 --> 37:03.125
<font color="#ffff00">And she sent emojis
of surprise and...</font>

37:03.208 --> 37:05.750
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes,
"Send me a picture."</font>

37:05.833 --> 37:08.208
<font color="#ffff00">And so I saw my opening.</font>

37:10.125 --> 37:14.292
<font color="#ffff00">So I was like,
"You send me a picture, man."</font>

37:14.375 --> 37:16.750
<font color="#ffff00">And she was like, "What of?"
And I was like, "You know."</font>

37:16.833 --> 37:19.542
<font color="#ffff00">And she was like,
"You fucking pig."</font>

37:19.625 --> 37:20.709
<font color="#ffff00">But we've been married
for a while,</font>

37:20.791 --> 37:23.041
<font color="#ffff00">so fucking three minutes later
a picture came through</font>

37:23.125 --> 37:25.125
<font color="#ffff00">and shit like that.
And so it was a angle</font>

37:25.208 --> 37:27.667
<font color="#ffff00">of my wife's vagina,
and this is weird to say</font>

37:27.750 --> 37:29.041
<font color="#ffff00">because, again, we've been
together 20 years</font>

37:29.125 --> 37:31.791
<font color="#ffff00">and we've had fucking sex
any way you can have sex.</font>

37:31.875 --> 37:33.167
<font color="#ffff00">But it was an angle
of her vagina</font>

37:33.250 --> 37:35.584
<font color="#ffff00">that I'd never seen before.</font>

37:35.667 --> 37:38.459
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Oh, my God!
It's like a stranger's pussy."</font>

37:38.542 --> 37:39.916
<font color="#ffff00">You know? And fucking...</font>

37:40.000 --> 37:41.833
<font color="#ffff00">So instantly I forgot
the conversation,</font>

37:41.916 --> 37:44.041
<font color="#ffff00">took it right to the sink
and started tugging one out,</font>

37:44.125 --> 37:45.584
<font color="#ffff00">looking right at it and shit.</font>

37:45.667 --> 37:46.875
<font color="#ffff00">So I got finished and then
I wanted to get in the shower</font>

37:46.958 --> 37:51.417
<font color="#ffff00">'cause I was sticky.
And so...</font>

37:51.500 --> 37:53.542
<font color="#ffff00">Took my black underwear
out of the pack.</font>

37:53.625 --> 37:54.500
<font color="#ffff00">I laid them out
on the fucking blanket,</font>

37:54.584 --> 37:56.625
<font color="#ffff00">there's like a white blanket
on the bed.</font>

37:56.709 --> 37:59.584
<font color="#ffff00">So it really popped hard
and shit.</font>

37:59.667 --> 38:02.208
<font color="#ffff00">And so I took a picture
and I wrote back,</font>

38:02.292 --> 38:03.333
<font color="#ffff00">"Yes, bitch."</font>

38:03.417 --> 38:07.791
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Doesn't this
make you wet, motherfucker?"</font>

38:09.833 --> 38:12.459
<font color="#ffff00">And I fucking hit send
and shit like that, man.</font>

38:12.542 --> 38:16.250
<font color="#ffff00">And I hadn't fucking realized
that my wife</font>

38:16.333 --> 38:20.417
<font color="#ffff00">was not the last person
that had sent me a text.</font>

38:20.500 --> 38:23.125
<font color="#ffff00">While I was in the shower,
somebody else had texted me</font>

38:23.208 --> 38:26.083
<font color="#ffff00">and broken the conversation
with me and my wife</font>

38:26.167 --> 38:29.958
<font color="#ffff00">and fucking the very shocked
recipient of my underwear text</font>

38:30.041 --> 38:34.208
<font color="#ffff00">sent back a one-word response:
"Dad?"</font>

38:40.459 --> 38:44.167
<font color="#ffff00">So some shit goes well beyond
a response text, you know.</font>

38:44.250 --> 38:46.791
<font color="#ffff00">I immediately fucking called her
up and I was like,</font>

38:46.875 --> 38:49.333
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh, my God, kiddo.
You know that fucking text</font>

38:49.417 --> 38:51.750
<font color="#ffff00">was not meant for you.
It was meant for your mother.</font>

38:51.833 --> 38:56.083
<font color="#ffff00">And by the way, no man should
ever talk to a lady like that."</font>

39:03.250 --> 39:06.292
<font color="#ffff00">I was fucking mortified, man.</font>

39:06.375 --> 39:08.667
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Oh, my God.
Are you okay?"</font>

39:08.750 --> 39:09.292
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes,
"You know I'm gonna need</font>

39:09.375 --> 39:12.500
<font color="#ffff00">a lot of therapy, right?"</font>

39:12.584 --> 39:15.375
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Yeah, but fucking
go ahead, we got the money.</font>

39:15.459 --> 39:16.667
<font color="#ffff00">Go ahead."</font>

39:16.750 --> 39:18.667
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "But you gotta admit,
man, like, you know,</font>

39:18.750 --> 39:20.333
<font color="#ffff00">it's not the way you wanna find
out, but isn't it kinda nice</font>

39:20.417 --> 39:23.875
<font color="#ffff00">to know that your parents,
after all that time,</font>

39:23.958 --> 39:25.625
<font color="#ffff00">are like into one another,</font>

39:25.709 --> 39:28.333
<font color="#ffff00">to send each other texts
like that?"</font>

39:28.417 --> 39:30.709
<font color="#ffff00">I was looking for any
silver lining and shit</font>

39:30.791 --> 39:32.208
<font color="#ffff00">in the conversation.</font>

39:32.292 --> 39:33.667
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "I was just
happy to see you've moved away</font>

39:33.750 --> 39:36.916
<font color="#ffff00">from maroon, Dad."</font>

39:44.500 --> 39:47.250
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, I just back from Vancouver.
I was up in Vancouver.</font>

39:47.333 --> 39:50.041
<font color="#ffff00">I directed my third episode
of The Flash.</font>

39:55.333 --> 39:57.375
<font color="#ffff00">It was fun. It was awesome, man.
I go up there,</font>

39:57.459 --> 39:59.958
<font color="#ffff00">like, you know, in TV they don't
really need a director</font>

40:00.041 --> 40:00.916
<font color="#ffff00">in episodic TV.</font>

40:01.000 --> 40:02.958
<font color="#ffff00">Cast and crew make that show
every week.</font>

40:03.041 --> 40:04.916
<font color="#ffff00">If you ever look at the credits
of your favorite shows,</font>

40:05.000 --> 40:07.292
<font color="#ffff00">the director's the only name
that really changes and stuff.</font>

40:07.375 --> 40:09.542
<font color="#ffff00">That's how fucking replaceable
the director really is.</font>

40:09.625 --> 40:11.459
<font color="#ffff00">So the cast and crew makes your
favorite show every week.</font>

40:11.542 --> 40:14.875
<font color="#ffff00">The director shows up and
is nominally in charge.</font>

40:14.958 --> 40:16.542
<font color="#ffff00">But you can't really change
shit about it, man.</font>

40:16.625 --> 40:19.791
<font color="#ffff00">Like you can't really walk in,
I couldn't walk into Flash</font>

40:19.875 --> 40:22.500
<font color="#ffff00">and be like, "We're changing
the look of Flash  this week.</font>

40:22.584 --> 40:25.000
<font color="#ffff00">It's all one shot,
back and white. Clerks."</font>

40:25.083 --> 40:26.167
<font color="#ffff00">Like that's...</font>

40:26.250 --> 40:29.500
<font color="#ffff00">So it's weird, when I show up
I find myself at a loss.</font>

40:29.584 --> 40:30.916
<font color="#ffff00">It's not like when I direct
a movie,</font>

40:31.000 --> 40:32.417
<font color="#ffff00">I'm involved in every aspect.</font>

40:32.500 --> 40:33.667
<font color="#ffff00">But on TV, I'm not really.</font>

40:33.750 --> 40:35.958
<font color="#ffff00">I'm kind of a bystander who gets
to say "action" and "cut."</font>

40:36.041 --> 40:39.125
<font color="#ffff00">But as a fan of the show,
it's fun</font>

40:39.208 --> 40:40.875
<font color="#ffff00">'cause you get to watch
that shit get made.</font>

40:40.958 --> 40:43.584
<font color="#ffff00">And I sit in on all the big
meetings and stuff like that.</font>

40:43.667 --> 40:46.584
<font color="#ffff00">And I watch very talented people
who do this every fucking week</font>

40:46.667 --> 40:47.542
<font color="#ffff00">sit around, talk to each other,</font>

40:47.625 --> 40:48.875
<font color="#ffff00">how they're gonna plan
this shit.</font>

40:48.958 --> 40:49.750
<font color="#ffff00">"How are we gonna make her fly?
How are we gonna do this shit</font>

40:49.833 --> 40:51.709
<font color="#ffff00">and whatnot?"
And then periodically,</font>

40:51.791 --> 40:53.791
<font color="#ffff00">they remember I'm there and they
look over at me and they go,</font>

40:53.875 --> 40:57.459
<font color="#ffff00">"What do you think, Kev?"</font>

40:57.542 --> 41:00.333
<font color="#ffff00">I'm like, "I think
that sounds awesome!" You know.</font>

41:00.417 --> 41:03.167
<font color="#ffff00">And they're like,
"Okay, big guy." You know.</font>

41:03.250 --> 41:05.125
<font color="#ffff00">And they go back to making
the fucking show</font>

41:05.208 --> 41:06.709
<font color="#ffff00">and stuff like that.
So it's been nice,</font>

41:06.791 --> 41:08.500
<font color="#ffff00">it's been a nice thing
to do, to go up there.</font>

41:08.584 --> 41:11.333
<font color="#ffff00">As a fan of the show,
I get to watch stuff get done.</font>

41:11.417 --> 41:13.083
<font color="#ffff00">And so, it first started
happening I think</font>

41:13.167 --> 41:14.333
<font color="#ffff00">when I was doing Supergirl.</font>

41:14.417 --> 41:17.791
<font color="#ffff00">Um, we were-- we were doing
some-- setting up</font>

41:17.875 --> 41:20.125
<font color="#ffff00">some fucking big sequence
at this pool.</font>

41:20.208 --> 41:22.584
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, the giant, like,
a community pool.</font>

41:22.667 --> 41:24.333
<font color="#ffff00">And it was a big wide shot
and whatnot.</font>

41:24.417 --> 41:25.958
<font color="#ffff00">We're doing it like
when the pool is closed</font>

41:26.041 --> 41:27.709
<font color="#ffff00">so it's like two in the morning.
It's real late.</font>

41:27.791 --> 41:30.125
<font color="#ffff00">So, you know, people are run
down, we've had our "lunch."</font>

41:30.208 --> 41:31.542
<font color="#ffff00">Which was at midnight
or whatever.</font>

41:31.625 --> 41:33.167
<font color="#ffff00">But people are getting tired
because it's late</font>

41:33.250 --> 41:35.083
<font color="#ffff00">and it's cold.
So, you know, I was like,</font>

41:35.167 --> 41:37.459
<font color="#ffff00">"Fuck man. I'm gonna get--
I'm gonna go get some</font>

41:37.542 --> 41:39.292
<font color="#ffff00">burgers for my crew."</font>

41:39.375 --> 41:41.542
<font color="#ffff00">For the people on camera
and stuff like that.</font>

41:41.625 --> 41:43.791
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause they're the ones that
gotta be up and sharp.</font>

41:43.875 --> 41:46.292
<font color="#ffff00">So I was talking
to the first AD,</font>

41:46.375 --> 41:47.208
<font color="#ffff00">he was like new on the show,</font>

41:47.292 --> 41:48.667
<font color="#ffff00">first time I'd ever
met him and stuff.</font>

41:48.750 --> 41:50.833
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Hey, man.
I was thinking about--</font>

41:50.916 --> 41:52.500
<font color="#ffff00">how long do you think
this is gonna take?"</font>

41:52.584 --> 41:54.333
<font color="#ffff00">He's like, "I think we're gonna
be ready to go in five minutes."</font>

41:54.417 --> 41:57.833
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey, I'm gonna go grab some
fucking burgers, man.</font>

41:57.916 --> 41:59.333
<font color="#ffff00">Can you watch this?"</font>

41:59.417 --> 42:01.709
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "What do you mean,
watch this?"</font>

42:01.791 --> 42:03.417
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Well,
if you guys are ready,</font>

42:03.500 --> 42:04.333
<font color="#ffff00">just start shooting
without me." He goes,</font>

42:04.417 --> 42:06.041
<font color="#ffff00">"What an interesting way
to direct a show</font>

42:06.125 --> 42:08.459
<font color="#ffff00">by not being there at all."</font>

42:08.542 --> 42:11.083
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I know,
but you guys do this shit</font>

42:11.167 --> 42:12.625
<font color="#ffff00">every week without me.
Let's be real.</font>

42:12.709 --> 42:14.125
<font color="#ffff00">And it's a big wide shot,
performance--</font>

42:14.208 --> 42:15.542
<font color="#ffff00">we're just doing it
for the wide.</font>

42:15.625 --> 42:17.750
<font color="#ffff00">It's the performance--
I'll be back for that and shit.</font>

42:17.833 --> 42:19.250
<font color="#ffff00">You got this, right?" He's like,
"Sure, man. Go ahead."</font>

42:19.333 --> 42:21.833
<font color="#ffff00">And so I fucking got
in the car</font>

42:21.916 --> 42:24.208
<font color="#ffff00">and I left set and I drove down
the road to--</font>

42:24.292 --> 42:27.292
<font color="#ffff00">In Canada,
they got an A&W place.</font>

42:27.375 --> 42:28.459
<font color="#ffff00">They do A&W burgers
and root beer and shit.</font>

42:28.542 --> 42:31.083
<font color="#ffff00">And it's-- they're amazing.
It's my favorite burger</font>

42:31.167 --> 42:33.125
<font color="#ffff00">on the fucking planet.</font>

42:33.208 --> 42:34.125
<font color="#ffff00">So they're open 24 hours.</font>

42:34.208 --> 42:35.167
<font color="#ffff00">And they're like literally
across the street</font>

42:35.250 --> 42:37.208
<font color="#ffff00">from where we were shooting.</font>

42:37.292 --> 42:39.709
<font color="#ffff00">So I rolled up on A&W
at two in the morning.</font>

42:39.791 --> 42:40.667
<font color="#ffff00">And I pull up to the box
and shit.</font>

42:40.750 --> 42:42.709
<font color="#ffff00">And they're like,
"A&W, can I help you?"</font>

42:42.791 --> 42:45.292
<font color="#ffff00">It's one guy. And I said,
"Uh, hi.</font>

42:45.375 --> 42:49.333
<font color="#ffff00">Let me get 20 Buddy Burgers,
man."</font>

42:49.417 --> 42:52.333
<font color="#ffff00">And the guy goes, "Yeah, right."</font>

42:53.459 --> 42:55.875
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "No, I'm serious.
20 Buddy Burgers."</font>

42:55.958 --> 42:58.041
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "Pull up to the
window so I can confirm</font>

42:58.125 --> 43:01.709
<font color="#ffff00">your method of payment."</font>

43:01.791 --> 43:02.958
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Okay, fair enough."</font>

43:03.041 --> 43:04.625
<font color="#ffff00">And I went up to fucking
next window and shit like that.</font>

43:04.709 --> 43:05.750
<font color="#ffff00">And he opened his window,
I rolled mine down,</font>

43:05.833 --> 43:10.292
<font color="#ffff00">and he goes, "Oh, it's you.
Well, that makes sense."</font>

43:15.208 --> 43:16.958
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "What the fuck's
that mean, man?"</font>

43:17.041 --> 43:18.208
<font color="#ffff00">He's like, "That's a lot
of burgers.</font>

43:18.292 --> 43:19.791
<font color="#ffff00">And I heard you were in town."
I was like,</font>

43:19.875 --> 43:22.250
<font color="#ffff00">"I-- they're not for me."</font>

43:22.333 --> 43:23.791
<font color="#ffff00">He was like, "I don't need
to ask any questions."</font>

43:23.875 --> 43:25.208
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "I'm getting them
for the people on Supergirl."</font>

43:25.292 --> 43:28.791
<font color="#ffff00">He's like, "I'm sure you are."</font>

43:28.875 --> 43:31.417
<font color="#ffff00">I go, "20 burgers, man. How long
is that supposed to take?</font>

43:31.500 --> 43:32.875
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause I'm supposed to be back
in five minutes."</font>

43:32.958 --> 43:35.459
<font color="#ffff00">He goes, "20 burgers usually
take about 20 minutes.</font>

43:35.542 --> 43:38.333
<font color="#ffff00">But like if you will take
a selfie with me,</font>

43:38.417 --> 43:40.292
<font color="#ffff00">I'll do it in ten."
I was like,</font>

43:40.375 --> 43:42.709
<font color="#ffff00">"If you'll do it in ten,
I'll fucking blow you, man."</font>

43:42.791 --> 43:46.041
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "The selfie
will be fine, Mr. Smith."</font>

43:46.125 --> 43:47.292
<font color="#ffff00">So I said, "Fantastic."
So I waited by the side,</font>

43:47.375 --> 43:49.625
<font color="#ffff00">he cooked up fucking 20 burgers
and shit.</font>

43:49.709 --> 43:51.791
<font color="#ffff00">Came out with two big bags,
gave them to me.</font>

43:51.875 --> 43:54.125
<font color="#ffff00">He's like, "Thanks."
We took a selfie and shit.</font>

43:54.208 --> 43:56.709
<font color="#ffff00">Off I went, back to the place.
I was like, "Yay, burgers!"</font>

43:56.791 --> 43:58.167
<font color="#ffff00">And I started giving out burgers
and shit.</font>

43:58.250 --> 43:59.916
<font color="#ffff00">And soon the burgers
were fucking gone.</font>

44:00.000 --> 44:01.584
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Oh, fuck.
I didn't get enough."</font>

44:01.667 --> 44:03.333
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "If I do this again,
I gotta get more."</font>

44:03.417 --> 44:05.000
<font color="#ffff00">Some crew members were like,
"Where's the burgers?"</font>

44:05.083 --> 44:06.125
<font color="#ffff00">I was like,
"Oh, they ate them all."</font>

44:06.208 --> 44:08.500
<font color="#ffff00">They're like, "Fucking A."
And walked away.</font>

44:08.584 --> 44:11.083
<font color="#ffff00">So I was like, "Fuck man.
Let me see if I can fucking</font>

44:11.167 --> 44:12.375
<font color="#ffff00">get some burgers going
and shit like that tomorrow."</font>

44:12.459 --> 44:15.500
<font color="#ffff00">So next day,
we were shooting late again.</font>

44:15.584 --> 44:17.292
<font color="#ffff00">Like it was one in the morning
and stuff.</font>

44:17.375 --> 44:20.333
<font color="#ffff00">And so, you know,
I was bored again on set</font>

44:20.417 --> 44:22.167
<font color="#ffff00">at a certain point,
everybody's working.</font>

44:22.250 --> 44:23.459
<font color="#ffff00">I don't really have anything
to do.</font>

44:23.542 --> 44:25.958
<font color="#ffff00">So I was like, maybe I'll go get
'em some fucking burgers, man.</font>

44:26.041 --> 44:27.625
<font color="#ffff00">I'll roll up on
the burger joint again.</font>

44:27.709 --> 44:28.958
<font color="#ffff00">It's right across the street.</font>

44:29.041 --> 44:32.000
<font color="#ffff00">So I pull up and I hear, uh,
"Welcome to A&W.</font>

44:32.083 --> 44:34.041
<font color="#ffff00">Can I help you?"
I said, "Hey.</font>

44:34.125 --> 44:35.709
<font color="#ffff00">Let me get 40 Buddy Burgers."</font>

44:35.791 --> 44:38.208
<font color="#ffff00">And the guy, it's not the guy
from the other night. He goes,</font>

44:38.292 --> 44:40.667
<font color="#ffff00">"What, are you high?"</font>

44:40.750 --> 44:43.709
<font color="#ffff00">"No, no, no." I was like,
"I-- no. I do want this."</font>

44:43.791 --> 44:46.584
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "Please drive up
to the next window</font>

44:46.667 --> 44:48.750
<font color="#ffff00">to confirm your method
of payment." You know.</font>

44:48.833 --> 44:51.542
<font color="#ffff00">So I drive up to the window,
he opens his up and mine,</font>

44:51.625 --> 44:55.375
<font color="#ffff00">he goes, "Oh, I heard about you.
I get it now."</font>

44:55.459 --> 44:56.709
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "What do you mean?"
He's going,</font>

44:56.791 --> 44:59.208
<font color="#ffff00">"You were here last night."
I said, "That's right.</font>

44:59.292 --> 45:00.250
<font color="#ffff00">I ordered 20 burgers."
He's like, "Yeah.</font>

45:00.333 --> 45:02.709
<font color="#ffff00">The guy last night,
he's a big fan and stuff.</font>

45:02.791 --> 45:04.500
<font color="#ffff00">He's been showing everybody
the picture."</font>

45:04.584 --> 45:06.417
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Right on." I said,
"Well, I'm back for more."</font>

45:06.500 --> 45:08.208
<font color="#ffff00">He goes, "What do you want?"
I said, "Can I get</font>

45:08.292 --> 45:10.542
<font color="#ffff00">40 Buddy Burgers, man?"
He goes, "Okay.</font>

45:10.625 --> 45:12.083
<font color="#ffff00">Give me your credit card."
I showed him. He's like,</font>

45:12.167 --> 45:13.833
<font color="#ffff00">"All right." I said,
"How long is that gonna take?"</font>

45:13.916 --> 45:15.375
<font color="#ffff00">He's like, "40 burgers,
40 minutes."</font>

45:15.459 --> 45:17.041
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Oh, well,
the guy yesterday, man,</font>

45:17.125 --> 45:18.375
<font color="#ffff00">he said 20 burgers
takes 20 minutes.</font>

45:18.459 --> 45:19.875
<font color="#ffff00">But he did it in ten and shit."</font>

45:19.958 --> 45:22.709
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "That's 'cause
the other guy's a big fan."</font>

45:28.875 --> 45:30.625
<font color="#ffff00">Understood, captain. You know...</font>

45:30.709 --> 45:33.500
<font color="#ffff00">So I went and waited.
40 minutes later, man,</font>

45:33.584 --> 45:34.916
<font color="#ffff00">they brought out my fucking
Buddy Burgers.</font>

45:35.000 --> 45:36.958
<font color="#ffff00">Big bags and shit like that.
I said thank you.</font>

45:37.041 --> 45:39.375
<font color="#ffff00">I went back to work and shit.
I was like, "Hey!</font>

45:39.459 --> 45:40.542
<font color="#ffff00">Fucking burgers for everybody!"</font>

45:40.625 --> 45:42.750
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone's like happy
to get them. It's crazy, man.</font>

45:42.833 --> 45:44.709
<font color="#ffff00">It's really sweet.
Like, it's...</font>

45:44.791 --> 45:46.333
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know why,
they're like, "Oh, my God.</font>

45:46.417 --> 45:47.791
<font color="#ffff00">This is nice." And I'm like,
"It's $1.99 burger."</font>

45:47.875 --> 45:51.459
<font color="#ffff00">I tell them all. I'm like, look,
man, I'm gonna go home</font>

45:51.542 --> 45:53.375
<font color="#ffff00">and they're gonna give me
so much fucking credit</font>

45:53.459 --> 45:55.791
<font color="#ffff00">for directing this episode.
We all know I didn't do shit.</font>

45:55.875 --> 45:58.750
<font color="#ffff00">The least thing I could do
is buy you a fucking burger.</font>

45:58.833 --> 46:02.625
<font color="#ffff00">And McCloud, the AD,
is like, "Fucking A." You know.</font>

46:04.167 --> 46:06.584
<font color="#ffff00">So it was great. Like people,
it really cheers people up</font>

46:06.667 --> 46:08.250
<font color="#ffff00">and shit like that. It's perfect
walking around food.</font>

46:08.333 --> 46:09.250
<font color="#ffff00">When you're done,
you just throw the paper out</font>

46:09.333 --> 46:11.417
<font color="#ffff00">and shit like that.
But I ran out of burgers,</font>

46:11.500 --> 46:12.916
<font color="#ffff00">40 wasn't enough. There
was still some people</font>

46:13.000 --> 46:14.083
<font color="#ffff00">that didn't get any.
I was like, "Fuck!</font>

46:14.167 --> 46:16.250
<font color="#ffff00">Next time I gotta go
fucking higher and shit."</font>

46:16.333 --> 46:18.667
<font color="#ffff00">So we had one more night
of night shoots and shit.</font>

46:18.750 --> 46:20.791
<font color="#ffff00">So it's about two in the morning
and at one point,</font>

46:20.875 --> 46:22.709
<font color="#ffff00">I rolled up to McCloud,
the AD, and I was like,</font>

46:22.791 --> 46:23.916
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey, McCloud." He goes,
"Go ahead.</font>

46:24.000 --> 46:25.709
<font color="#ffff00">Just get me three burgers."
You know.</font>

46:25.791 --> 46:28.875
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "Will do, man."
So I got in the car,</font>

46:28.958 --> 46:31.292
<font color="#ffff00">and I went back
to fucking A&W and shit.</font>

46:31.375 --> 46:32.958
<font color="#ffff00">And I pull up to the box
and I was like,</font>

46:33.041 --> 46:36.916
<font color="#ffff00">"Hi, man. I'm-- let me get
70 Mama Burgers, please."</font>

46:37.000 --> 46:40.041
<font color="#ffff00">And the guy goes,
"Right away, Mr. Smith."</font>

46:48.250 --> 46:49.667
<font color="#ffff00">I'd built something of a
reputation of sorts and stuff.</font>

46:49.750 --> 46:52.958
<font color="#ffff00">So, you know, I was like,
"Oh, fuck. This is great."</font>

46:53.041 --> 46:55.167
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "You know what?
I'm gonna go deeper tonight."</font>

46:55.250 --> 46:56.833
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "70 Mama Burgers.</font>

46:56.916 --> 46:59.417
<font color="#ffff00">Let me get like 40 French fries
as well."</font>

46:59.500 --> 47:01.333
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "Okay."
I said, "20 onion rings."</font>

47:01.417 --> 47:04.459
<font color="#ffff00">He goes, "Right on." And I'm
looking at the menu board,</font>

47:04.542 --> 47:06.750
<font color="#ffff00">like I've been going to A&W
three nights in a row.</font>

47:06.833 --> 47:07.833
<font color="#ffff00">And since I stay away
from sugar,</font>

47:07.916 --> 47:11.958
<font color="#ffff00">I've been trying not
to succumb to the temptation</font>

47:12.041 --> 47:13.709
<font color="#ffff00">because like I love root beer.</font>

47:13.791 --> 47:14.916
<font color="#ffff00">It's one of my favorite things
in the world.</font>

47:15.000 --> 47:16.833
<font color="#ffff00">I love sugar.
I love sugar on anything.</font>

47:16.916 --> 47:19.791
<font color="#ffff00">You put it on dog shit,
I'm like this is the best.</font>

47:19.875 --> 47:21.500
<font color="#ffff00">But root beer is one
of my favorites.</font>

47:21.584 --> 47:23.625
<font color="#ffff00">And they market it so well.
Like the orange and brown</font>

47:23.709 --> 47:26.584
<font color="#ffff00">just like makes you salivate
and shit,</font>

47:26.667 --> 47:28.333
<font color="#ffff00">like a Pavlovian response.</font>

47:28.417 --> 47:30.208
<font color="#ffff00">And all these days and nights
I've been able</font>

47:30.292 --> 47:31.333
<font color="#ffff00">to not fucking get
a root beer.</font>

47:31.417 --> 47:34.500
<font color="#ffff00">But I'm like, it's fucking
two in the morning, man.</font>

47:34.584 --> 47:36.459
<font color="#ffff00">And like you're buying everyone
these burgers.</font>

47:36.542 --> 47:37.791
<font color="#ffff00">And like it's
like your mom said:</font>

47:37.875 --> 47:40.833
<font color="#ffff00">you're a good boy.
You know? Like...</font>

47:40.916 --> 47:43.125
<font color="#ffff00">You fucking--
you deserve a treat, man.</font>

47:43.208 --> 47:45.542
<font color="#ffff00">Why don't you get yourself
a fucking root beer, champ.</font>

47:45.625 --> 47:47.958
<font color="#ffff00">You know. And I was like,
"Let me add to that, man.</font>

47:48.041 --> 47:52.000
<font color="#ffff00">I wanna add one small
diet root beer."</font>

47:52.083 --> 47:55.000
<font color="#ffff00">And he starts laughing,
the guy in the ordering box.</font>

47:55.083 --> 47:56.709
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "What's the matter?"
He goes, "Look at the screen."</font>

47:56.791 --> 48:00.250
<font color="#ffff00">And I looked at the screen,
it said 70 Mama Burgers,</font>

48:00.333 --> 48:01.459
<font color="#ffff00">40 French fries,
20 onion rings,</font>

48:01.542 --> 48:05.916
<font color="#ffff00">one small diet root beer."</font>

48:07.500 --> 48:11.750
<font color="#ffff00">He goes, "That looks like the
worst diet ever attempted."</font>

48:11.833 --> 48:16.292
<font color="#ffff00">He goes, "I'm totally
Instagramming that."</font>

48:16.375 --> 48:17.667
<font color="#ffff00">So I pull up to the fucking
window and shit,</font>

48:17.750 --> 48:18.958
<font color="#ffff00">give him my credit card,
it's my friend</font>

48:19.041 --> 48:21.625
<font color="#ffff00">from the first night and shit,
the guy I took pictures with.</font>

48:21.709 --> 48:22.709
<font color="#ffff00">I was like,
"Hey, man. It's you."</font>

48:22.791 --> 48:24.709
<font color="#ffff00">He's like, "Mr. Smith,
I gotta tell you."</font>

48:24.791 --> 48:25.625
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Look, first off,
Mr. Smith is my father.</font>

48:25.709 --> 48:27.709
<font color="#ffff00">Just call me Kevin."
He goes, "Kevin,</font>

48:27.791 --> 48:29.584
<font color="#ffff00">I gotta tell you,
I've been telling my manager</font>

48:29.667 --> 48:30.916
<font color="#ffff00">that you've been
coming every night</font>

48:31.000 --> 48:32.459
<font color="#ffff00">and that you've been buying
these burgers.</font>

48:32.542 --> 48:34.709
<font color="#ffff00">And my manager asked me
to ask you</font>

48:34.791 --> 48:37.041
<font color="#ffff00">if you wanna give us one
of your jerseys,</font>

48:37.125 --> 48:39.750
<font color="#ffff00">we'll hang it up here
in the A&W."</font>

48:39.833 --> 48:43.083
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Are you telling
me you wanna raise my</font>

48:43.167 --> 48:46.292
<font color="#ffff00">fucking jersey to the rafters</font>

48:46.375 --> 48:48.584
<font color="#ffff00">of an A&W Root Beer?"</font>

48:54.667 --> 48:55.542
<font color="#ffff00">I was like,
"That's the highest honor</font>

48:55.625 --> 48:59.417
<font color="#ffff00">a non-Canadian can receive."</font>

49:00.833 --> 49:04.250
<font color="#ffff00">So, um, so I found my place,
like that's what I do.</font>

49:04.333 --> 49:06.292
<font color="#ffff00">I bring shit.
I bring food for people,</font>

49:06.375 --> 49:07.375
<font color="#ffff00">I bring toys for the actors.</font>

49:07.459 --> 49:09.542
<font color="#ffff00">That's how I do the actors
and shit like that.</font>

49:09.625 --> 49:12.208
<font color="#ffff00">I learned that when I was
on Supergirl  at one point.</font>

49:12.292 --> 49:13.833
<font color="#ffff00">I had like a break,
lunch break,</font>

49:13.916 --> 49:16.250
<font color="#ffff00">and rather than sit around
and eat lunch,</font>

49:16.333 --> 49:18.791
<font color="#ffff00">like I smoked lunch.
And then we were near</font>

49:18.875 --> 49:21.958
<font color="#ffff00">a Toys 'R' Us, so I went stoner
shopping and stuff like that.</font>

49:22.041 --> 49:24.500
<font color="#ffff00">And, you know, I had a basket
so I kept throwing in shit.</font>

49:24.584 --> 49:25.709
<font color="#ffff00">Everything under five bucks,</font>

49:25.791 --> 49:27.459
<font color="#ffff00">little trinkets
and shit like that.</font>

49:27.542 --> 49:29.958
<font color="#ffff00">And so I bought like a book
of stickers,</font>

49:30.041 --> 49:31.417
<font color="#ffff00">puffy animal stickers.</font>

49:31.500 --> 49:33.875
<font color="#ffff00">We went back to shoot a scene
with Chyler,</font>

49:33.958 --> 49:35.916
<font color="#ffff00">who plays Supergirl's sister,
Alex,</font>

49:36.000 --> 49:38.083
<font color="#ffff00">and with Melissa,
who plays Supergirl.</font>

49:38.167 --> 49:40.125
<font color="#ffff00">And so we were about
to rehearse,</font>

49:40.208 --> 49:42.875
<font color="#ffff00">do a blocking rehearsal, and I
had one of the puffy stickers,</font>

49:42.958 --> 49:44.083
<font color="#ffff00">I had it on my finger and I
walked up to the two ladies</font>

49:44.167 --> 49:48.375
<font color="#ffff00">and I was like, "Ladies,
you see this puffy dog sticker?</font>

49:48.459 --> 49:52.542
<font color="#ffff00">Whoever wins this scene
wins the sticker."</font>

49:54.208 --> 49:57.125
<font color="#ffff00">It was adorable. Chyler goes,
"You're going down, bitch."</font>

49:57.208 --> 49:58.833
<font color="#ffff00">You know, fucking...</font>

50:00.542 --> 50:01.709
<font color="#ffff00">And they did, they fucking
out-acted each other,</font>

50:01.791 --> 50:05.709
<font color="#ffff00">like wizards fighting
and shit like that.</font>

50:05.791 --> 50:07.500
<font color="#ffff00">All for the puffy sticker.
And at the end,</font>

50:07.584 --> 50:09.875
<font color="#ffff00">I was like you both
get a puffy sticker.</font>

50:09.958 --> 50:12.208
<font color="#ffff00">And Chyler was like,
"That wasn't the rule."</font>

50:12.292 --> 50:14.000
<font color="#ffff00">You know.</font>

50:14.083 --> 50:16.584
<font color="#ffff00">But how I direct is I bring
food for everybody</font>

50:16.667 --> 50:17.667
<font color="#ffff00">and give them toys and shit.</font>

50:17.750 --> 50:20.958
<font color="#ffff00">I'm more of like a craft service
person, you know.</font>

50:21.041 --> 50:24.709
<font color="#ffff00">Or a candy man
than anything else.</font>

50:24.791 --> 50:27.292
<font color="#ffff00">Um, I love doing
this sort of thing.</font>

50:27.375 --> 50:28.833
<font color="#ffff00">And there's always people
that will come up to me</font>

50:28.916 --> 50:32.292
<font color="#ffff00">after the show,
say very nice things.</font>

50:32.375 --> 50:34.958
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, very cool things about
like, "Oh, my God.</font>

50:35.041 --> 50:37.333
<font color="#ffff00">It's so... you're so talented."</font>

50:37.417 --> 50:39.167
<font color="#ffff00">That's the one that
really fucking bugs me</font>

50:39.250 --> 50:42.333
<font color="#ffff00">and shit like that. Me-- and not
because I'm irritated by it.</font>

50:42.417 --> 50:44.833
<font color="#ffff00">But when you say shit
like "talent,"</font>

50:44.916 --> 50:47.167
<font color="#ffff00">it makes people go like,
"Oh, you're special</font>

50:47.250 --> 50:48.250
<font color="#ffff00">and this person's not."
I don't agree with that.</font>

50:48.333 --> 50:51.709
<font color="#ffff00">I don't really do anything
that requires talent.</font>

50:51.791 --> 50:53.167
<font color="#ffff00">I just kind of chase my dreams.</font>

50:53.250 --> 50:55.709
<font color="#ffff00">Anything I wanna try,
I give a shot to and stuff.</font>

50:55.791 --> 50:57.625
<font color="#ffff00">Before I get out of the show,
I always like to remind people,</font>

50:57.709 --> 50:59.958
<font color="#ffff00">like, you can do that too.</font>

51:00.041 --> 51:00.875
<font color="#ffff00">Like, at the end of the day,</font>

51:00.958 --> 51:02.791
<font color="#ffff00">this doesn't require
fucking talent.</font>

51:02.875 --> 51:04.292
<font color="#ffff00">Invariably,
somebody will say to me,</font>

51:04.375 --> 51:05.292
<font color="#ffff00">before the night is over,
"Oh, my God.</font>

51:05.375 --> 51:07.542
<font color="#ffff00">It's so talented how
you can stand up there</font>

51:07.625 --> 51:08.375
<font color="#ffff00">and talk for so long."
And I'm like,</font>

51:08.459 --> 51:11.041
<font color="#ffff00">"That doesn't take talent
to talk</font>

51:11.125 --> 51:13.916
<font color="#ffff00">and tell stories about my life.
That just takes a memory.</font>

51:14.000 --> 51:17.167
<font color="#ffff00">Like that's... that's it.
That doesn't require talent."</font>

51:17.250 --> 51:18.916
<font color="#ffff00">My day job doesn't even
take talent.</font>

51:19.000 --> 51:20.791
<font color="#ffff00">You think it takes talent
to stand on a movie set</font>

51:20.875 --> 51:23.208
<font color="#ffff00">and wear a backwards
baseball cap</font>

51:23.292 --> 51:26.333
<font color="#ffff00">and a trench coat
and say nothing?</font>

51:26.417 --> 51:29.250
<font color="#ffff00">That's the exact opposite
of fucking talent, man.</font>

51:29.333 --> 51:30.958
<font color="#ffff00">I said I'll take it
one step further.</font>

51:31.041 --> 51:33.250
<font color="#ffff00">It doesn't take talent at all
to work in the movie business.</font>

51:33.333 --> 51:35.375
<font color="#ffff00">You think it takes fucking
talent to stand on a movie set</font>

51:35.459 --> 51:36.916
<font color="#ffff00">and be like, "I'm Batman."
Ben Affleck does it,</font>

51:37.000 --> 51:40.709
<font color="#ffff00">so I know it don't take
fucking talent.</font>

51:48.791 --> 51:51.500
<font color="#ffff00">Don't let people use
like a word like that</font>

51:51.584 --> 51:54.000
<font color="#ffff00">to put shit between you
and something you wanna try.</font>

51:54.083 --> 51:56.667
<font color="#ffff00">This doesn't take talent.
It doesn't take talent</font>

51:56.750 --> 51:59.750
<font color="#ffff00">to talk about your fucking life.
Over the course of your life,</font>

51:59.833 --> 52:01.375
<font color="#ffff00">you've listened to people talk
on the radio,</font>

52:01.459 --> 52:04.500
<font color="#ffff00">or seen people talk on TV,
and you've said to yourself</font>

52:04.584 --> 52:08.083
<font color="#ffff00">or thought to yourself,
"I'm smarter than these people.</font>

52:08.167 --> 52:10.667
<font color="#ffff00">I'm funnier than this person."
You're probably thinking that</font>

52:10.750 --> 52:12.125
<font color="#ffff00">shit right now.</font>

52:12.208 --> 52:15.125
<font color="#ffff00">And you're probably right, man,
but nobody's gonna know</font>

52:15.208 --> 52:17.167
<font color="#ffff00">unless you kinda go out there
and express yourself</font>

52:17.250 --> 52:19.750
<font color="#ffff00">in some way, shape or form.
Share of yourself.</font>

52:19.833 --> 52:21.625
<font color="#ffff00">Now, some people don't want to
'cause they're afraid</font>

52:21.709 --> 52:23.292
<font color="#ffff00">that it might not work
and shit like that.</font>

52:23.375 --> 52:26.167
<font color="#ffff00">Like, "Oh, what if I fail?"
But there is no such thing</font>

52:26.250 --> 52:29.333
<font color="#ffff00">as fucking failure. Failure
is just success training.</font>

52:29.417 --> 52:31.083
<font color="#ffff00">I know that sounds like a cat
poster, but it's fucking true.</font>

52:31.167 --> 52:35.000
<font color="#ffff00">Like, nobody ever fucking
gets something right</font>

52:35.083 --> 52:36.750
<font color="#ffff00">on the first try and shit.</font>

52:36.833 --> 52:37.958
<font color="#ffff00">Don't be afraid of failure.</font>

52:38.041 --> 52:40.375
<font color="#ffff00">Don't let that
keep you from trying something</font>

52:40.459 --> 52:42.125
<font color="#ffff00">that you might wanna try
and stuff like that.</font>

52:42.208 --> 52:44.125
<font color="#ffff00">Rather fail spectacularly
than live your life wondering,</font>

52:44.208 --> 52:46.083
<font color="#ffff00">like, "I wonder if that shit
would have worked out."</font>

52:46.167 --> 52:49.417
<font color="#ffff00">That's how I've just
kind of conducted myself</font>

52:49.500 --> 52:51.083
<font color="#ffff00">for the last like 20, 25 years.</font>

52:51.167 --> 52:53.125
<font color="#ffff00">And it's led on this weird
fucking journey.</font>

52:53.208 --> 52:55.083
<font color="#ffff00">So the cats who come out
and support me</font>

52:55.167 --> 52:56.125
<font color="#ffff00">and see the shows and stuff,
I always wanna try</font>

52:56.208 --> 52:58.750
<font color="#ffff00">to give something back
at the end of the day.</font>

52:58.833 --> 53:00.709
<font color="#ffff00">Like you've given me so much.
You've given me a way</font>

53:00.791 --> 53:02.667
<font color="#ffff00">to not have to fucking work
for a living.</font>

53:02.750 --> 53:05.000
<font color="#ffff00">So like, you know,
I always wanna try to give back.</font>

53:05.083 --> 53:08.250
<font color="#ffff00">I could give the money back,
but fuck that. So like...</font>

53:08.333 --> 53:10.500
<font color="#ffff00">the least I could give back
is I know there are people</font>

53:10.584 --> 53:12.250
<font color="#ffff00">in the audience that are like,
"I kinda wanna do what you do."</font>

53:12.333 --> 53:16.208
<font color="#ffff00">And you absolutely fucking can.
I'm gonna tell you something</font>

53:16.292 --> 53:19.208
<font color="#ffff00">that maybe like you don't hear
that much anymore,</font>

53:19.292 --> 53:20.875
<font color="#ffff00">'cause you're adults and shit,
and it's our job</font>

53:20.958 --> 53:22.833
<font color="#ffff00">to say this to younger people
and shit.</font>

53:22.916 --> 53:25.083
<font color="#ffff00">But this is the truest sentiment
a stranger's gonna fucking</font>

53:25.167 --> 53:26.250
<font color="#ffff00">tell you this week,
so fucking get ready.</font>

53:26.333 --> 53:30.000
<font color="#ffff00">You are smart and good.
You're all fucking talented.</font>

53:30.083 --> 53:32.667
<font color="#ffff00">You all have something amazing
to fucking say.</font>

53:32.791 --> 53:35.709
<font color="#ffff00">-So...</font>

53:35.791 --> 53:37.459
<font color="#ffff00">find a way...</font>

53:37.542 --> 53:39.333
<font color="#ffff00">Find a way
to fucking share that.</font>

53:39.417 --> 53:42.167
<font color="#ffff00">I-- I've, like,
I'm 47 years old.</font>

53:42.250 --> 53:45.083
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm still trying to figure
out who the fuck I am.</font>

53:45.167 --> 53:48.459
<font color="#ffff00">So before you leave this world,
figure out who you are</font>

53:48.542 --> 53:49.625
<font color="#ffff00">at your core, man.</font>

53:49.709 --> 53:52.500
<font color="#ffff00">I have, as I mentioned
at the beginning of the show,</font>

53:52.584 --> 53:55.125
<font color="#ffff00">a kid, like so I guess
at my core, ultimately,</font>

53:55.208 --> 53:57.417
<font color="#ffff00">I'm a fucking dad.
So I do dad-type things</font>

53:57.500 --> 53:59.709
<font color="#ffff00">and I wanna share this fucking
last thing with you.</font>

53:59.791 --> 54:03.125
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, my kid and I text.
This is a text exchange</font>

54:03.208 --> 54:05.000
<font color="#ffff00">we had about her boyfriend,
Cory.</font>

54:05.083 --> 54:07.292
<font color="#ffff00">She's got this
boyfriend, Cory, man.</font>

54:07.375 --> 54:08.292
<font color="#ffff00">He's a great fucking kid.</font>

54:08.375 --> 54:10.083
<font color="#ffff00">I know you're supposed to be
like, "Hey, man.</font>

54:10.167 --> 54:11.208
<font color="#ffff00">He's dating my daughter
and that makes me mad."</font>

54:11.292 --> 54:13.709
<font color="#ffff00">Not at all. They've been dating
for five years,</font>

54:13.791 --> 54:15.375
<font color="#ffff00">they met like freshman year,
and when they were dating</font>

54:15.459 --> 54:18.250
<font color="#ffff00">for four days, man, I watched
and met the dude and shit,</font>

54:18.333 --> 54:21.667
<font color="#ffff00">and I told my daughter,
"Marry this boy tomorrow."</font>

54:21.750 --> 54:23.833
<font color="#ffff00">You know. And my wife is like,
"You fucking stoned?</font>

54:23.916 --> 54:25.709
<font color="#ffff00">They're 14." I was like, "It
worked for Coalminer's Daughter.</font>

54:25.791 --> 54:29.417
<font color="#ffff00">Let them get married!"</font>

54:29.500 --> 54:30.584
<font color="#ffff00">So I him,
I'm a Cory booster, man.</font>

54:30.667 --> 54:32.709
<font color="#ffff00">I'm always like, "You'll never
find a guy like this.</font>

54:32.791 --> 54:33.958
<font color="#ffff00">He literally gives a shit
about everything you say.</font>

54:34.041 --> 54:35.292
<font color="#ffff00">He's always hanging
on your every word.</font>

54:35.375 --> 54:39.041
<font color="#ffff00">He's like Lloyd Dobler
in Say Anything  and shit.</font>

54:39.125 --> 54:42.584
<font color="#ffff00">Not every guy is like this.
Most guys are like Uncle Jay.</font>

54:42.667 --> 54:44.584
<font color="#ffff00">So like...</font>

54:44.667 --> 54:46.167
<font color="#ffff00">I said stick with this
fucking guy.</font>

54:46.250 --> 54:47.292
<font color="#ffff00">So she did all through
high school and stuff.</font>

54:47.375 --> 54:51.333
<font color="#ffff00">And senior year, like I said,
she just graduated,</font>

54:51.417 --> 54:53.833
<font color="#ffff00">she got to go to two proms,
her prom at her school</font>

54:53.916 --> 54:55.500
<font color="#ffff00">and Cory went
to a different school.</font>

54:55.584 --> 54:58.417
<font color="#ffff00">So they went to her prom first,
then they went to Cory's prom.</font>

54:58.500 --> 55:00.417
<font color="#ffff00">And I was out on the road
doing a gig.</font>

55:00.500 --> 55:03.083
<font color="#ffff00">And this is the fucking text
I got from my kid</font>

55:03.167 --> 55:05.459
<font color="#ffff00">on prom night. She goes,
"Dad! SOS."</font>

55:05.542 --> 55:08.833
<font color="#ffff00">I'm freaked out 'cause I'm
someplace else in the country.</font>

55:08.916 --> 55:10.625
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm like, "Oh, my God!
Are you okay?"</font>

55:10.709 --> 55:13.292
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "No!
Cory's bowtie broke.</font>

55:13.375 --> 55:17.041
<font color="#ffff00">Where do you keep
your spare bowties?"</font>

55:24.167 --> 55:29.375
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Kiddo, I don't have
a bowtie, let alone spares."</font>

55:29.459 --> 55:31.625
<font color="#ffff00">And she wrote, she has
the temerity to write,</font>

55:31.709 --> 55:32.833
<font color="#ffff00">"Seriously?"</font>

55:32.916 --> 55:37.167
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm like, "I wear the same
fucking outfit every day."</font>

55:37.250 --> 55:40.667
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "You ever see me wear
a bowtie with a hockey jersey?"</font>

55:40.750 --> 55:42.875
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "What about
when you got married?"</font>

55:42.958 --> 55:44.542
<font color="#ffff00">And I said,
"I was wearing a hoodie</font>

55:44.625 --> 55:47.500
<font color="#ffff00">and a Jay and Silent Bob
shirt."</font>

55:47.584 --> 55:50.916
<font color="#ffff00">And she goes, "Ew! You're so
fucking lucky Mom married you."</font>

55:51.000 --> 55:54.041
<font color="#ffff00">And I said... I said, "Why?</font>

55:54.125 --> 55:55.625
<font color="#ffff00">Because I wasn't wearing
a bowtie?" And she goes,</font>

55:55.709 --> 55:57.833
<font color="#ffff00">"No, because you wore
a Jay and Silent Bob  shirt</font>

55:57.916 --> 55:59.208
<font color="#ffff00">to your own wedding."</font>

55:59.292 --> 56:06.125
<font color="#ffff00">And she wrote, "Duh! Look at me!
I'm Silent Bob!"</font>

56:06.208 --> 56:09.250
<font color="#ffff00">Ladies and gentlemen, you have
a good time this evening?</font>

56:12.292 --> 56:16.292
<font color="#ffff00">I cannot thank you enough
for coming out, man!</font>

56:16.375 --> 56:17.125
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks for listening
to me bullshit!</font>

56:17.208 --> 56:18.459
<font color="#ffff00">Make sure you go out
and bullshit</font>

56:18.542 --> 56:22.125
<font color="#ffff00">before you leave this world!
I love you all, good night!</font>

56:49.459 --> 56:54.167
<font color="#ffff00">This is the room where I almost
died. Look at this.</font>

56:54.250 --> 56:56.000
<font color="#ffff00">Could you imagine if this
was your death room?</font>

56:56.083 --> 56:58.125
<font color="#ffff00">The last thing you saw was this?</font>

56:58.208 --> 57:00.875
<font color="#ffff00">I could not get comfortable
to save my life.</font>

57:00.958 --> 57:02.667
<font color="#ffff00">That's 'cause I was dying.</font>

57:02.750 --> 57:05.459
<font color="#ffff00">Kids, when you're dying,
very tough to get comfortable.</font>

57:05.542 --> 57:07.584
<font color="#ffff00">Basically, three hours prior
to this moment,</font>

57:07.667 --> 57:10.625
<font color="#ffff00">I'd smoked a joint,
so I was calm.</font>

57:10.709 --> 57:12.625
<font color="#ffff00">I never got scared and stuff.</font>

57:12.709 --> 57:14.250
<font color="#ffff00">They told me later on,
the doctor was like,</font>

57:14.333 --> 57:15.916
<font color="#ffff00">"You were so calm."
And I said,</font>

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
