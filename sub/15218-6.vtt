<i>It all started when a time travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

00:05.443 --> 00:08.378

00:08.446 --> 00:11.938
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock,</i>
<i>I went from quantum physicist... </i>

00:12.016 --> 00:15.383
<i>To air force test pilot,</i>

00:15.453 --> 00:18.854
<i>which could have been fun</i>

00:18.923 --> 00:22.188
<i>Fortunately, I had help... </i>

00:22.260 --> 00:27.129
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram,</i>

00:27.198 --> 00:30.190

00:30.268 --> 00:33.362

00:33.438 --> 00:37.306
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>

<i>This quantum leaping through time</i>

02:14.605 --> 02:16.732
<i>You never know who</i>

02:16.808 --> 02:19.709
<i>Fortunately, I have Al</i>
<i>as my chaperone... </i>

02:19.777 --> 02:24.009

02:31.155 --> 02:34.488
<i>Thanks, Frankie. </i>
<i>You was terrific. </i>

02:37.428 --> 02:39.589
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.234
As Al would say, timing is everything.

02:46.304 --> 02:50.001
What did she call me?
Terrific.

02:50.074 --> 02:52.736
No, dummy.
Frankie was terrific.

02:52.810 --> 02:55.506
That's it... Frankie.
She called me Frankie.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.707
Frankie what?

02:57.782 --> 02:59.716
Frankie who?

03:07.525 --> 03:10.085
Frankie. Wow.

03:11.429 --> 03:15.263
Whatever I was here to improve,
it wasn't Frankie's looks.

03:20.104 --> 03:23.904
Aha! So that's what you're
supposed to look like in a tux.

03:23.975 --> 03:25.909
Eat your heart out, Al.

03:28.412 --> 03:31.040
Okay, you got a job to do,
so whatever it is...

03:31.115 --> 03:34.016
Let's get to it, killer.

03:42.693 --> 03:44.718
Mama, how you like Angela's hair?

03:54.572 --> 03:56.506
Dibs on winners.

03:56.574 --> 03:58.508
Oh, hey, Teresa, I don't know.

03:58.576 --> 04:00.771
What, afraid I'm gonna
beat your pants off?

04:00.845 --> 04:03.780
You can beat my pants off
any time you like, Teresa.

04:03.848 --> 04:06.282
You should be so lucky, Segundo.

04:11.088 --> 04:13.022
Ain't that calamari tasty, Nonna?

04:13.090 --> 04:16.719
Tastes like a rubber.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.834
Scusa.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.966
Give me that.

04:38.482 --> 04:41.383
Who's playing with smooth balls?

04:42.887 --> 04:44.821
Your point, Tony.

04:47.391 --> 04:49.154
Sorry, Gino.

04:49.226 --> 04:51.319
We could've worked this out
for ourselves, Teresa.

04:51.395 --> 04:55.456
How? It's Tony's point, but no one's
gonna say so 'cause they're afraid of you.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.797
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

05:07.412 --> 05:08.443
Come on.

05:11.849 --> 05:14.647
Buon giorno.

05:25.363 --> 05:29.129
I thought when you showed up
at my daughter's wedding,

05:29.200 --> 05:31.293
you want to be friends again.

05:31.369 --> 05:34.930
I'm here because Angela
asked me to be her beautician.

05:35.006 --> 05:38.373
Now I think you come
to embarrass me.

05:38.442 --> 05:42.742
You're the godfather, Gino.
You don't need to cheat at "bocci".

05:49.320 --> 05:51.948
That's what I like about you.

05:52.023 --> 05:55.686
You talk to me like
I'm some ordinary "gibbone".

06:00.031 --> 06:03.489
Why don't you meet me
at our old place tonight?

06:03.567 --> 06:06.400
No.
Ah, come on.

06:06.470 --> 06:09.405
I'll talk dirty to you.
We'll have a good time.

06:14.712 --> 06:17.146
You got somebody, don't you?

06:17.214 --> 06:21.048
Yeah. I got a guy who wants to
commit suicide. Who could I have?

06:21.118 --> 06:25.646
Everybody in Brooklyn knows you'll hit
any man over 14 who says hello to me.

06:25.723 --> 06:28.658
Why don't I believe you?
Why start now?

06:28.726 --> 06:31.354
You didn't believe me when I said we
were through either. We're not through.

06:31.429 --> 06:33.659
Not until I say so.
Capisce?

06:37.802 --> 06:40.464
You're a piece of work, Teresa.

06:42.406 --> 06:45.239
A real piece of work.

07:03.127 --> 07:06.221
Oh, boy. I'm supposed
to speak Italian.

07:26.016 --> 07:28.780
Bingo?

07:33.390 --> 07:38.123
Hey, Frankie, Papa wants you to meet
our cousins from Philadelphia.

07:38.195 --> 07:41.164
They're all doctors.
And Primo wants you to sing.

07:42.933 --> 07:44.867
Si...
Sing?

07:44.935 --> 07:47.961
Yeah, sing.
Hey, che cosa, Nonna?

07:48.038 --> 07:50.131
Don't you "che cosa" me, Segundo.

07:50.207 --> 07:52.539
That's the only thing you know
in Italian.

07:52.610 --> 07:55.909
Why you don't speak-a good
like your brother Francesco?

07:55.980 --> 07:58.642
I let my lips do the talking, Nonna.

08:03.521 --> 08:06.456
Let's go. Hurry up. Come on.
Primo's waiting. Everybody's waiting.

08:06.524 --> 08:11.154
Hey, everybody! My brother Frankie
gonna sing at my wedding!

08:16.367 --> 08:19.427
So, what do you want him to sing,
babe? You name it, you got it.

08:19.503 --> 08:21.437
Right, Frankie?
Uh-huh.

08:21.505 --> 08:27.137
"Volare. " Please, Frankie.
You sing "Volare" better than Modugno.

08:27.211 --> 08:30.339
Oh, I don't know about that.
Oh, "Volare. "

08:30.414 --> 08:34.214
Come on, baby!

08:40.857 --> 08:43.793
Al.

08:43.861 --> 08:46.523
Just sing the song.
We'll go somewhere private.

08:46.597 --> 08:49.532
Then these people won't see you
talking to yourself like a lunatic.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.160
Sing?
Make a noise with your voice.

08:52.236 --> 08:54.033
- I can sing?
- Trust me.

08:54.104 --> 08:57.301
- I don't know the words.
- "volare"

09:03.113 --> 09:05.809
- <i>volare</i>
- "Oh, oh. "

09:05.883 --> 09:09.011
<i>Oh, oh</i>

09:09.086 --> 09:11.520
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh.

09:11.589 --> 09:14.854
<i>Cantare,oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

09:14.925 --> 09:16.586
"Nel blu dipinto di blu. "

09:16.660 --> 09:19.185
<i>Nel blu dipinto di blu</i>

09:19.263 --> 09:22.596
"Felice di stare lassu".

09:22.666 --> 09:26.568
"E volavo, volavo
felice piu in alto. "

09:26.637 --> 09:30.733
"Del sole ed ancora piu su".

09:35.946 --> 09:39.939
"Una musica dolce suonava
soltanto per me. "

09:40.017 --> 09:43.282
<i>Una musica dolce... per me</i>

09:43.354 --> 09:47.518
- "volare" again.
- <i>volare</i>

09:47.591 --> 09:50.560
<i>Oh, oh</i>

09:50.628 --> 09:52.687
I got it.

09:52.763 --> 09:55.129
<i>Cantare</i>

09:55.199 --> 09:59.067
<i>Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

10:00.671 --> 10:04.107
<i>Nel blu, dipinto di blu</i>

10:04.174 --> 10:06.574
<i>Felice di stare lassu</i>

10:06.644 --> 10:10.102
<i>volare</i>

10:10.180 --> 10:14.378
<i>Oh, wo-oh-oh-oh, yeah</i>

10:14.451 --> 10:17.249
<i>Cantare</i>

10:17.321 --> 10:20.882
<i>Wo-oh-oh-oh</i>

10:22.126 --> 10:25.289
<i>Your love has given me wings</i>

10:25.362 --> 10:28.388
Teresa gave me the slip
for 20 minutes.

10:28.465 --> 10:33.334
<i>Vooooo... </i>

10:33.404 --> 10:36.430
One, two, one, two, three!

10:36.507 --> 10:40.136
See what happens when a
puttana like Teresa walks out on you?

10:40.210 --> 10:42.144
You lose respect.

10:42.212 --> 10:46.308
And when you lose respect,
you lose fear.

10:46.383 --> 10:49.443
That's not true, Don Gino.
Now he tells me I'm wrong.

10:49.520 --> 10:54.457
<i>Vo-o-o-olare</i>

10:54.525 --> 10:57.858
- You want me to put Frankie on it?
- No, no. I can handle this, Don Gino.

10:57.928 --> 11:01.557
I swear it. Whoever she's with
is dead meat.

11:01.632 --> 11:05.830
I don't want him dead meat.
I want him singing soprano.

11:16.613 --> 11:18.877
Why do you have to know exactly where?

11:18.949 --> 11:21.042
I don't have to know, pal.

11:21.118 --> 11:23.780
But Ziggy has to know
if you want us to retrieve you.

11:23.854 --> 11:26.186
You're gonna try again? When?

11:26.256 --> 11:29.191
As soon as Ziggy has
the data that he needs.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.819
And I hope it happens
before I melt.

11:31.895 --> 11:36.195
Exactly where did you find yourself
when you popped into '65?

11:36.266 --> 11:39.463
Sixty-five? This is 1965?

11:39.536 --> 11:44.166
Sixty-five!
L. BJ. 's president. Vietnam.

11:44.241 --> 11:47.039
Don't remind me.
But think of the bright side!

11:47.111 --> 11:49.875
Sandy Koufax pitches
a perfect game.

11:53.751 --> 11:56.777
I'm 10, in the fourth grade.

11:58.255 --> 12:00.348
Marcia Green
sits right in front of me.

12:00.424 --> 12:03.416
And you used to dip her pigtails
into the inkwells.

12:03.494 --> 12:06.054
We didn't have inkwells.
Oh, we did.

12:06.130 --> 12:08.496
I used to dip
Hanna Gretz's pigtails.

12:08.565 --> 12:12.695
That was until I discovered it was a lot
more fun to take Hanna into the cloakroom.

12:12.770 --> 12:16.763
In the fourth grade?
I was... socially advanced.

12:18.308 --> 12:20.868
I'm so hot.

12:20.944 --> 12:26.883
Sam, I'm sweating off pounds here
I can't afford to lose.

12:28.952 --> 12:32.388
Now, where did you pop in?

12:37.795 --> 12:40.628
Hmm. Was it here?

12:40.697 --> 12:43.894
Hmm. What were you doing, Sam?

12:43.967 --> 12:47.266
Why are you so hot?
It's cold in here.

12:47.337 --> 12:49.271
I'm a hologram, remember?

12:49.339 --> 12:52.103
In an imaging chamber
a couple of decades ahead of here.

12:52.176 --> 12:55.236
The imaging chamber
is air conditioned. Isn't it?

12:55.312 --> 12:56.973
Well, not anymore.

12:57.047 --> 13:01.245
Ziggy has shut down
all non-vital electrical systems.

13:01.318 --> 13:05.652
And since he's a computer,
that means no human comforts...

13:05.722 --> 13:10.091
no air conditioning, no TV,
no microwaved taco chips and cheese.

13:10.160 --> 13:10.742
Why?

13:10.743 --> 13:13.823
Because his ego is bigger
than his memory banks.

13:13.897 --> 13:17.264
Ziggy refuses to accept responsibility...

13:17.334 --> 13:19.928
for not being able to get you back.

13:20.003 --> 13:24.770
Sam, it looks like you popped in
just a tad late, huh?

13:24.842 --> 13:27.606
Sort of. How'd you know?

13:27.678 --> 13:31.136
Well, Frankie's condition when
he appeared in the waiting room...

13:31.215 --> 13:33.683
left very little to the imagination.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.684
Who's Frankie?

13:35.752 --> 13:37.982
Frankie...
he's a... he's a hit man.

13:38.055 --> 13:41.115
A what?

13:41.191 --> 13:43.591
A hit man. You know,
bang-a, bang-a, bang-a.

13:46.163 --> 13:49.189
Hey, I didn't say you were a hit man.

13:49.266 --> 13:51.700
It doesn't make me feel any better.

13:53.103 --> 13:55.128
Who's the girl?

13:55.205 --> 13:57.366
Girl? What girl?

13:59.109 --> 14:00.804
The girl.

14:00.878 --> 14:04.678
Oh. Oh, no data. Uh, could have been
any one of a dozen.

14:04.748 --> 14:08.309
Now, Frankie, he's a very
good-lookin' stud, as you know.

14:08.385 --> 14:11.286
Take it from someone who knows.
When you're a good-lookin'stud...

14:11.355 --> 14:14.381
Al. Al. Al! You're gonna have a lot
of girls eating right out of...

14:14.458 --> 14:17.723
What? I'm in trouble here. I'm a Mafia hit man.

14:17.794 --> 14:20.627
- No, you're not. Frankie is.
- You know what I mean.

14:22.432 --> 14:25.333
What, uh...

14:25.402 --> 14:28.337
What am I here to do?

14:28.405 --> 14:31.772
Well, I don't know.
We only did a top line on Frankie.

14:31.842 --> 14:34.902
We didn't have any time
for in-depth research.

14:34.978 --> 14:38.209
Uh, it's on Ziggy's
nonessential electrical use list.

14:38.282 --> 14:40.216
Nonessential?

14:40.284 --> 14:44.482
Look, God or time or whoever the hell it is
leaping me around from one year to another...

14:44.555 --> 14:48.166
is gonna do it again as soon as I change
whatever happened in Frankie's life in '65,

14:48.167 --> 14:49.356
or someone around him, right?

14:49.426 --> 14:52.259
- Correct.
- Wouldn't it be nice to know what that is?

14:52.329 --> 14:54.695
Not necessarily.

14:54.765 --> 14:57.666
Because Ziggy is 97.3% sure...

14:57.734 --> 15:00.225
that he can leap you back
if both of us...

15:00.304 --> 15:02.864
pay attention to his instructions
down to the decimal point.

15:02.940 --> 15:06.239
What instructions?
Well, you're supposed to do...

15:06.310 --> 15:10.679
whatever Frankie would do
until we receive further instructions.

15:10.747 --> 15:14.478
Uh, oh, by the way,
this, I think, is yours.

15:27.464 --> 15:30.092
What if I'm supposed to use this?

15:30.167 --> 15:32.795
Make sure you take the safety off.

15:34.371 --> 15:37.101
That's not funny, Al.

15:38.675 --> 15:40.609
Al?

15:49.453 --> 15:51.580
Okay, come on.

15:51.655 --> 15:55.489
I don't understand you.
Who, me?

15:55.559 --> 15:59.757
You just got married yesterday.
Yeah. So?

15:59.830 --> 16:02.321
Didn't Angela want a honeymoon?

16:02.399 --> 16:06.028
Let me tell you something.
I gave her her honeymoon last night.

16:08.805 --> 16:13.003
You're sick.
I am? Hey, I look sick?

16:13.076 --> 16:15.636
You're hung-over.

16:15.712 --> 16:18.545
Don't you love her?
Who?

16:18.615 --> 16:20.549
Angela.

16:20.617 --> 16:24.212
Oh. Well, yeah, I like her.

16:24.288 --> 16:28.190
If you only like her,
why did you marry her?

16:28.258 --> 16:31.284
Because you told me
it'd be a good thing to do.

16:33.430 --> 16:35.330
Oh.

16:35.399 --> 16:37.765
Hey, hey, hey! You animal!
Get outta the street!

16:37.834 --> 16:40.826
Up yours.! Hey, don't
you remember you and Pop said...

16:40.904 --> 16:42.997
that if Primo
was the don's son-in-law,

16:43.073 --> 16:45.200
we could move on the Carlucci’s,
no problem?

16:45.275 --> 16:48.403
Yeah.
Huh? What, did you change your mind?

16:50.113 --> 16:53.412
Well, I... I...

16:53.483 --> 16:54.780
Hello!

16:57.054 --> 17:00.990
You know, I could use a haircut.
Maybe she's got an opening.

17:01.058 --> 17:04.516
What, you're gonna get
your hair cut from Teresa?

17:04.594 --> 17:08.462
Teresa. Yeah.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.462
<i>I had the sudden feeling that in '65... </i>

17:13.537 --> 17:16.028
<i>men weren't having</i>
<i>their hair styled by women. </i>

17:16.106 --> 17:18.801
<i>At least not in South Brooklyn. </i>

17:18.875 --> 17:21.273
<i>Maybe I'm here to start
the unisex revolution. </i>

17:21.345 --> 17:23.342
Can I get a trim?

17:25.382 --> 17:28.010
If you have the time,
uh, a little bit off the ears.

17:29.786 --> 17:33.654
This is nice.
It's round and full.

17:33.724 --> 17:35.919
Kind of "beehivey. "

17:44.501 --> 17:46.435
Want to give me
a shampoo first?

17:53.205 --> 17:54.544
Hello.

17:55.011 --> 17:58.412
Hey.

18:09.893 --> 18:10.612
Thank you.

18:10.613 --> 18:14.353
Frankie, what are you trying to
do, get us killed or something?

18:14.431 --> 18:19.801
Trust me, in a year, men everywhere
will be getting their hair styled in salons.

18:19.870 --> 18:24.170
Your father may have saved his life,
and Primo may be his son-in-law,

18:24.241 --> 18:27.142
but if Gino finds out about us,
you'll be feeding the fishes...

18:27.210 --> 18:29.144
and I'll be wearing
concrete undies.

18:29.212 --> 18:31.271
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

18:31.348 --> 18:34.840
Gino? Like in Don Gino?

18:34.918 --> 18:37.580
Come on, Frankie, be serious.

18:37.654 --> 18:41.954
Look, I wanna be able to lead a normal life
with you too, but this is stupido.

18:42.025 --> 18:44.687
I can see that.
Then why did you do it?

18:44.761 --> 18:49.198
Well, I... I saw you in the window,
and it seemed like a good idea.

18:49.266 --> 18:53.396
You mean you got the hots for me
so bad, you don't care?

18:54.538 --> 18:57.803
Well, uh...
Oh, oh, Frankie.

18:57.874 --> 19:00.707
I feel the same way.

19:00.777 --> 19:05.646
I got the hots for you the...
the minute I laid my eyes on you.

19:05.715 --> 19:09.378
You were standing outside
Luigi's Fish Market...

19:09.453 --> 19:12.354
with that big '45 in your hand,

19:12.422 --> 19:16.051
blowing holes
in the Giacanni brothers.

19:16.126 --> 19:20.893
And when you noticed that I was hiding
behind the salted cod and winked,

19:20.964 --> 19:23.899
ah, I knew it was kismet.

19:23.967 --> 19:26.731
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

19:48.124 --> 19:51.389
My condolences on the loss
of your eldest son, paisan.

19:52.696 --> 19:55.324
But, Gino, this is my idea.

19:55.398 --> 19:58.595
Well, you know how women,
they talk in the beauty parlors.

19:58.668 --> 20:03.332
I mean, they say things to each other that they
wouldn't tell their priest on their deathbed.

20:03.406 --> 20:07.502
I figure, well, Frankie goes in there,
maybe gets a haircut from Teresa.

20:07.577 --> 20:12.378
She may for one split second forget
that he's a man, and let something slip.

20:14.584 --> 20:17.109
You live long enough,
you see everything.

20:17.187 --> 20:21.351
Even your most trusted paisan
trying to slip you the salami. No.

20:21.424 --> 20:23.858
No?

20:23.927 --> 20:27.385
You think for one moment
that if Frankie was boffin' Teresa...

20:27.464 --> 20:30.160
that he would be sitting
in that chair in that window?

20:30.233 --> 20:35.000
Gino, I swear
on my firstborn grandchild...

20:35.071 --> 20:38.438
Angela told you?

20:41.611 --> 20:45.172
Frankie is not the one
you want singing soprano.

20:46.883 --> 20:51.013
Swearing on Primo and Angela's
firstborn touches me, Tony.

20:51.087 --> 20:53.954
It's very Sicilian. I like that.

20:54.024 --> 20:56.925
So, I'm gonna give Frankie a chance.

21:00.997 --> 21:03.295
Mille grazie, Godfather.

21:03.366 --> 21:08.531
I'm gonna ask him why he's getting his
hair cut in a woman's beauty parlor.

21:08.605 --> 21:12.507
And he better tell me
it was your idea.

21:15.512 --> 21:17.571
Now who's stupido?

21:17.647 --> 21:19.979
And don't talk with your hands.

21:26.489 --> 21:29.947
Woops. Sorry.

21:32.696 --> 21:34.926
Gino! What a surprise.

21:34.998 --> 21:38.229
This is a surprise.

21:38.301 --> 21:40.462
It does seem to attract attention.

21:40.537 --> 21:42.437
Give me a razor, Teresa.

21:42.505 --> 21:45.167
A razor?

21:49.913 --> 21:53.349
You know, the haircut
looks great, Teresa. I...

21:53.416 --> 21:56.283
You haven't had your shave yet.

21:58.088 --> 22:01.182
Actually, I shaved this morning.

22:01.257 --> 22:03.657
Always shave in the morning.

22:03.727 --> 22:06.560
It's kind of a habit, I guess.

22:06.630 --> 22:08.757
You got 5:00 shadow.

22:08.832 --> 22:11.801
Women don't like men
with 5:00 shadow.

22:11.868 --> 22:13.836
Well, th-that depends.

22:13.903 --> 22:15.837
On what?

22:15.905 --> 22:17.839
The date?

22:17.907 --> 22:22.810
How about November the 9th, 1965?

22:24.114 --> 22:26.275
Well, see, you got me.

22:26.349 --> 22:29.910
5:00 shadow, uh...
wasn't big in '65.

22:31.454 --> 22:34.184
I meant a straight razor, Teresa.

22:34.257 --> 22:36.885
This ain't a barbershop, Gino.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.928
Go tease some hair.

22:42.866 --> 22:44.800
Frankie.
Uh-huh.

22:44.868 --> 22:47.496
I'm gonna ask you a question.

22:47.570 --> 22:51.836
If you answer correctly, all that
happens is you get a good shave.

22:51.908 --> 22:55.173
Why do I feel like
I better answer it correctly?

22:55.245 --> 22:59.545
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna slice
your throat and cut off your naso.

22:59.616 --> 23:02.050
I was afraid of that.

23:02.118 --> 23:04.609
You ready?

23:04.688 --> 23:06.622
No.

23:06.690 --> 23:09.181
I'm gonna ask anyway.

23:18.101 --> 23:21.093
<i>Oh, God, he's asking me in Italian. </i>

23:36.753 --> 23:40.519
<i>Teresa? He wants to know if she's giving</i>
<i>Frankie more than a shampoo and a trim. </i>

23:40.590 --> 23:42.251
<i>What would Frankie say?</i>

23:42.325 --> 23:45.260
- No.
- No?

23:52.669 --> 23:55.729
<i>Maybe that isn't what Frankie would say. </i>

23:55.805 --> 23:58.467
<i>Frankie would say something in Italian. </i>

23:59.542 --> 24:01.635
Volare.

24:01.711 --> 24:04.077
- Volare?
- Hmm.

24:04.147 --> 24:07.776
- Sam.
- Al!

24:07.851 --> 24:10.081
Don't look at me.
Look at him.

24:10.153 --> 24:12.087
You just told him to fly away.

24:12.155 --> 24:15.488
- Che Al?
- I know what he wants to hear,

24:15.558 --> 24:17.753
so you repeat after me.

24:17.827 --> 24:21.285
Albert.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.754
No, don't...
Repeat after me, Sam.

25:27.430 --> 25:29.489
- No.
- No.

25:29.566 --> 25:32.797
No.

25:54.490 --> 25:57.982
No? Too much for you, huh?
Okay, just say...

26:06.336 --> 26:08.201
That's it.

26:24.087 --> 26:27.818
Getting your hair cut by a woman
is one thing, but by Teresa!

26:27.891 --> 26:31.691
Marrone! Frankie, what
were you thinking about?

26:31.761 --> 26:33.854
It was getting a little long
around the ears.

26:33.930 --> 26:37.093
I don't know, Pop. Frankie's
hair's looking really good.

26:37.166 --> 26:39.657
Better than the haircuts
you get at Angelo's.

26:39.736 --> 26:42.569
You don't get your throat cut
at Angelo's.

26:44.073 --> 26:46.371
Ah, well, that was business.

26:46.442 --> 26:50.139
Anyway, I know the godfather
like a brother.

26:50.213 --> 26:54.172
The only reason why he believed you today
is because of the bullet I took for him.

26:54.250 --> 26:57.879
Now, until you find the "stugazzo"
that Teresa is cheating with,

26:57.954 --> 27:01.117
Don Gino's gonna be watching you
with a Sicilian eye.

27:01.190 --> 27:04.990
The "stugazt" she's cheating with?
What about the cheating that he's doing?

27:05.061 --> 27:07.689
What cheating?
On his wife.

27:07.764 --> 27:10.426
What is he talking about?
Beats me, Pop.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.991
All right, look, just forget it.

27:15.038 --> 27:18.735
Just find the "stugazzo",
and everything will be "va bene"?

27:18.808 --> 27:20.833
Capisce?

27:22.211 --> 27:24.145
Capisce.

27:25.982 --> 27:28.075
Take me home.

27:28.151 --> 27:30.142
What?
Come here.

27:30.219 --> 27:32.744
You make the collections.

27:32.822 --> 27:37.191
And don't forget, you're supposed
to take Nonna to the bingo tonight.

27:37.260 --> 27:40.354
Humor her. She hasn't
won a game in three years,

27:40.430 --> 27:42.523
and she thinks you're lucky.

27:42.598 --> 27:45.431
"Stugazt," bingo. Got it.

27:45.501 --> 27:48.766
Frankie, you okay?

27:50.573 --> 27:53.474
I'm fine, Papa.

27:55.511 --> 27:57.445
Come on. Let's go.

27:57.513 --> 27:59.913
Andiamo. Let's go.

27:59.983 --> 28:03.680
Pop, I've been thinking:
Since Gino's my father-in-law,

28:03.753 --> 28:07.018
I don't think he'd mind
if Teresa gave me a haircut.

28:07.090 --> 28:09.320
Don't think, Primo.
Don't think. It's not for you.

28:09.392 --> 28:12.054
You know, he probably wouldn't care
if you got a perm and a set.

28:12.128 --> 28:15.063
Hey, I got your perm and set right here. Where?

28:15.131 --> 28:17.065
Right here.
Aaah!

28:17.133 --> 28:20.625
My old man was Italian. From Abruzzi.

28:20.703 --> 28:23.467
A regular Hop along "Cassaditch. "

28:23.539 --> 28:26.372
I remember when I was a kid,
my dad and his girlfriend...

28:26.442 --> 28:28.967
used to sneak me out of the orphanage
on Saturday nights...

28:29.045 --> 28:31.639
for a little homemade risotto
and Chianti.

28:31.714 --> 28:34.808
One night, he brought along
this extra girl, and he says to me,

28:34.884 --> 28:37.478
"Son, I think it's about time... "
Al,

28:37.553 --> 28:40.954
I don't have time to hear your stories
about your Hop along Cassidy father.

28:41.024 --> 28:44.391
Cassaditch. Hop along Cassaditch. It's
an expression that goes way back... Al!

28:44.460 --> 28:48.590
Al, I'm in trouble here. I gotta leap
out of here before Gino finds out...

28:48.664 --> 28:51.599
that Frankie's the guy beating
his time with Teresa. Capisce?

28:51.667 --> 28:54.033
Look at me.
I'm talking like them.

28:54.103 --> 28:57.129
Teresa! This is the little lady...

28:57.206 --> 29:00.664
you were bingo-bango-bongoing
up in the attic, huh?

29:00.743 --> 29:03.439
Teresa is the lady that Frankie was...

29:03.513 --> 29:05.447
whatever in the attic.

29:05.515 --> 29:09.451
Oh, this is going to make retrieving
you tonight very interesting.

29:09.519 --> 29:13.455
Tonight? You're leaping me out
tonight? At 22:28 Greenwich Mean Time.

29:13.523 --> 29:15.457
Great.
Provided...

29:15.525 --> 29:18.255
Here it comes.
You follow Ziggy's program.

29:18.327 --> 29:23.697
One: At 22:15 Greenwich Mean Time,

29:23.766 --> 29:27.793
you must plug in
a thousand-watt hair dryer...

29:27.870 --> 29:30.930
in a house located
at 111 Erie Drive, Buffalo, New York.

29:31.007 --> 29:34.534
What? Two: At the designated retrieval time...

29:34.610 --> 29:37.374
22:28 Greenwich Mean Time,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:37.447 --> 29:41.713
You got that. You must be at the exact
same location arrived at yesterday.

29:41.784 --> 29:43.911
Don Gino's attic.
Don Gino's attic?

29:43.986 --> 29:47.046
Whatever.
How can I be in Buffalo at 22:15...

29:47.123 --> 29:49.591
and back in Brooklyn 13 minutes later?

29:49.659 --> 29:51.718
I never said it would be easy.

29:51.794 --> 29:54.991
Okay, okay. Um,

29:55.064 --> 29:58.056
I'll get Primo and Segundo
to go to Buffalo.

29:58.134 --> 30:01.228
You'd trust your leap to them?
I'm trusting you and Ziggy.

30:03.106 --> 30:06.200
Three: You must duplicate...

30:06.275 --> 30:09.802
the event that was occurring
when you arrived.

30:09.879 --> 30:14.248
In other words, you have to be with
whomever was present in that attic.

30:14.317 --> 30:19.186
Teresa. And engaged in whatever
activity was taking place.

30:22.191 --> 30:24.921
Geez, I'm hot.

30:27.663 --> 30:30.154
Thanks a lot.
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

30:30.233 --> 30:32.360
Come on, hurry up, Primo.

30:32.435 --> 30:36.394
You know, hitting Buffalo I understand.

30:36.472 --> 30:39.532
A hair dryer in Buffalo, non capisco.

30:39.609 --> 30:42.134
Hey, Frankie says we do it,
we do it.

30:42.211 --> 30:45.908
If Frankie says you jump off
the Brooklyn Bridge, would you jump?

30:45.982 --> 30:49.611
No. That'd be stupid.

30:52.421 --> 30:54.412
Yah!

30:56.526 --> 30:59.359
- Teresa.
- Uh, hi.

30:59.428 --> 31:01.953
Frankie!

31:02.031 --> 31:05.694
Teresa, I need to see you tonight.

31:05.768 --> 31:08.396
You mean, after today
you still want to make it with me?

31:11.274 --> 31:14.471
More than ever. But you gotta meet me
by 4:00, 4:30 at the latest.

31:14.544 --> 31:16.478
I don't close till 5:00.

31:16.546 --> 31:19.879
Teresa, this is important.

31:19.949 --> 31:23.077
It has to do with the future.

31:23.152 --> 31:25.985
You think we got one?

31:26.055 --> 31:28.148
Of course we got one.

31:28.224 --> 31:31.022
Oh, Frankie!
Where you wanna meet, hon?

31:31.093 --> 31:34.995
- Don Gino's attic?
- Where!

31:37.967 --> 31:40.868
Now, don't panic. Don't panic.
We can sneak up the trellis.

31:40.937 --> 31:43.371
No one will ever know we're there.
I'll know!

31:43.439 --> 31:47.307
Teresa, you said I was terrific
in the attic.

31:47.376 --> 31:52.006
Frankie, you're terrific anywhere. But why go
somewhere as stupido as Gino's attic?

31:52.081 --> 31:54.049
Because...

31:55.818 --> 31:58.753
you were terrific in the attic.

31:58.821 --> 32:02.086
In Gino's attic, you were
better than anywhere else.

32:03.626 --> 32:05.560
I was?

32:07.029 --> 32:09.725
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

32:09.799 --> 32:11.790
Better than anywhere?

32:11.867 --> 32:14.267
Anywhere.

32:15.605 --> 32:19.701
Better than under the table
at the Sons of Italy?

32:19.775 --> 32:23.006
Under the table...

32:23.079 --> 32:26.640
Uh... yeah.

32:26.716 --> 32:31.483
Better than...
beneath the West End El?

32:33.489 --> 32:35.889
Definitely.

32:35.958 --> 32:38.654
Or behind the furnace
at St. Francis?

32:39.729 --> 32:42.596
Behind the furnace?
Uh-huh.

32:44.300 --> 32:48.566
Teresa, you were awesome
behind the furnace.

32:48.638 --> 32:50.230
Awesome?

32:50.306 --> 32:53.104
Uh, it's an expression.

32:53.175 --> 32:56.440
Oh. Awesome.

32:58.347 --> 33:00.747
I like it.

33:00.816 --> 33:02.943
Let's be awesome.

33:05.988 --> 33:09.082
In my attic? In my attic!

33:09.158 --> 33:12.594
Si, Don Gino. I watched them
climb up there with my own eyes.

33:12.662 --> 33:15.256
My wife lives there.
My daughter...

33:15.331 --> 33:18.266
Some people,
they got no respect.

33:18.334 --> 33:21.030
Oh, they gonna have respect.

33:21.103 --> 33:24.163
If I don't teach them
anything else tonight,

33:24.240 --> 33:26.504
I'm gonna teach 'em respect.

33:32.615 --> 33:35.641
What's the matter with these
people? Don't they pay electric bills?

33:35.718 --> 33:38.346
This is fraternity row, you idiot.
Their folks pay the bills.

33:38.421 --> 33:41.356
All right. It should be the last one
on the right. That one.

33:41.424 --> 33:43.016
Where?
There.

33:43.092 --> 33:46.391
A&P has a fraternity!

33:46.462 --> 33:50.228
That's Alpha Rho, you idiot!
Primo, it's Greek!

33:50.299 --> 33:54.793
No kidding. I didn't know
A&P supermarkets were Greek.

33:54.870 --> 33:58.135
- Come here.
- What?

33:58.207 --> 34:00.141
What time is it?

34:01.577 --> 34:03.511
"What time is it"?

34:03.579 --> 34:06.844
I'm hotter than your old man's pepe rosa,
and you wanna know the time?

34:06.916 --> 34:10.784
It's... critical to our future.

34:10.853 --> 34:15.790
Oh, you mean like... like the stars
gotta be in the right place or something?

34:15.858 --> 34:18.121
Yeah.

34:18.194 --> 34:20.889
Yeah, yeah,
that's exactly what I mean.

34:20.963 --> 34:24.558
Betelgeuse in Orion has to be aligned
with the North Celestial Pole.

34:24.632 --> 34:27.693
I didn't know
you knew the stars.

34:27.770 --> 34:29.795
Neither did I.

34:29.871 --> 34:33.603
So, where is this Betel...
Betelgeuse.

34:33.676 --> 34:36.406
Yeah. Star.
There, in Orion's shoulder.

34:36.478 --> 34:40.779
Frankie, I wouldn't know Orion's
shoulder from his culo.

34:40.850 --> 34:44.411
It's that bright red star
just above the trees.

34:44.487 --> 34:48.514
See it?
Oh. Huh.

34:48.591 --> 34:52.789
It's real pretty... like a diamond.

34:52.862 --> 34:57.765
So, what time do these stars
have to get... aligned?

34:57.833 --> 35:01.166
22:28 Greenwich Mean Time.

35:01.237 --> 35:03.501
Huh?

35:03.572 --> 35:06.234
5:28 Eastern Standard Time.

35:07.576 --> 35:11.603
It's a quarter after.
Shouldn't we be getting started?

35:13.549 --> 35:16.211
Come on, Primo.
It's almost 5:15.

35:17.420 --> 35:20.981
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing?

35:21.056 --> 35:23.047
I'm lookin' for a plug.

35:23.125 --> 35:25.719
For what?
For this.

35:25.795 --> 35:28.423
You from the Beta house?

35:28.497 --> 35:32.490
No, Brooklyn. You know
where I can plug this in?

35:32.568 --> 35:35.696
Yeah, I'll show you
where you can plug it.

35:36.906 --> 35:40.842
You can... You can plug it in
right here.

35:51.687 --> 35:53.154
Primo, come on!

35:56.025 --> 35:57.083
Hurry up!

36:17.580 --> 36:18.808
Wow!

36:22.117 --> 36:25.280
Did you hear that?
That was my zipper.

36:30.893 --> 36:34.192
What now?

36:34.263 --> 36:37.391
You know I'm supposed to meet
Nonna at bingo.

36:37.466 --> 36:39.866
You're thinking about bingo?

36:39.935 --> 36:42.130
Well, it just crossed my mind.

36:42.204 --> 36:46.698
I'm about to be awesome, and you're worried
about putting the arm on Father Sebastian?

36:46.775 --> 36:48.709
What?

36:48.777 --> 36:51.541
Well, ain't that what you're
doing so Nonna can win?

36:51.614 --> 36:53.707
Coerce a priest?

36:53.782 --> 36:57.274
Frankie, what the hell
is going on here?

36:57.353 --> 37:00.015
Nothing.
That's for sure.

37:00.089 --> 37:04.958
I risk life and limb to come up here,
and you're acting like a pinocchio.

37:05.027 --> 37:06.961
Teresa...

37:09.565 --> 37:11.897
I'm not the Frankie you know.

37:11.967 --> 37:14.162
Boy, is that ever right.

37:14.236 --> 37:16.466
I could never...

37:16.539 --> 37:20.475
I could never stand outside
of Luigi's Fish Market...

37:20.543 --> 37:23.512
blowing holes
in the Giacanni brothers.

37:23.579 --> 37:26.571
Or make love to you
behind the furnace at St. Francis...

37:26.649 --> 37:28.583
or even cheat at bingo.

37:28.651 --> 37:33.588
And if I can't do any of those things,
I can't lie to you either.

37:33.656 --> 37:35.624
Why stop now?

37:35.691 --> 37:38.319
What do you mean?

37:38.394 --> 37:41.795
Frankie, I know you lie to me.

37:41.864 --> 37:45.163
All men lie to me.
They always have.

37:45.234 --> 37:48.635
They tell me what I want to hear
so they can get what they want.

37:48.704 --> 37:51.036
That's life.

37:53.175 --> 37:57.407
That's wrong. You deserve
better than that, Teresa.

37:57.479 --> 37:59.811
Why? 'Cause I can cut hair?

37:59.882 --> 38:02.180
For starters.

38:02.251 --> 38:06.085
It's a gift, a talent
that makes you special.

38:06.155 --> 38:09.613
You got a lot of things that make you
special, Teresa. You're pretty, you're sweet...

38:09.692 --> 38:13.753
No, Frankie. Don't say it
unless you mean it.

38:15.998 --> 38:18.057
Look, I don't know
about the old Frankie,

38:18.133 --> 38:21.864
but this Frankie is telling you...

38:21.937 --> 38:24.497
you're special, Teresa.

38:24.573 --> 38:26.803
Very special.

38:30.145 --> 38:32.807
God help me, I believe you.

38:48.564 --> 38:50.998
Holy hell!
We just lost Niagara Falls!

38:51.066 --> 38:54.502
Automatic circuits have switched over
to Rochester to pick up the load.

38:54.570 --> 38:56.731
Rochester can't handle it.
Override!

38:56.805 --> 38:59.968
It's too late.
There goes Toronto.

39:11.120 --> 39:15.022
Scusi.

39:15.090 --> 39:18.787
How is it possible...

39:18.861 --> 39:22.524
that two of mine...

39:22.598 --> 39:25.396
do something
as dishonorable as this?

39:28.637 --> 39:30.628
There goes Massachusetts.

39:40.716 --> 39:44.550
My God! We're losing
the whole East Coast.

39:44.620 --> 39:48.818
It was all...
It was all my fault, Don Gino.

39:48.891 --> 39:54.386
That's nice. I like a man
who faces his death with honesty.

39:56.598 --> 39:59.761
I lied to Teresa...

39:59.835 --> 40:03.066
to get her...
to get her up here with me.

40:03.138 --> 40:08.337
I, uh... I wanted to make love to her,
but she refused.

40:14.450 --> 40:16.509
Is that so, Teresa?

40:16.585 --> 40:19.554
No. Frankie's lying
to protect me.

40:19.621 --> 40:22.454
But you don't own me.
I can be with who I want to be with.

40:22.524 --> 40:25.550
And I wanted to be with Frankie.

40:26.795 --> 40:31.061
But he wouldn't look at me.
He said it was disrespectful to you,

40:31.133 --> 40:33.294
so I tricked him
into coming up here.

40:38.774 --> 40:42.266
Frankie!

40:59.528 --> 41:02.554
Oh, God.
Now I'm Don Gino.

41:02.631 --> 41:05.293
Frankie, are you all right, hon?

41:05.367 --> 41:08.234
Teresa, hey, you talk
about your earth moving.

41:08.303 --> 41:10.965
- Oh, God.
- Don Gino!

41:11.039 --> 41:13.200
What's happening?

41:13.275 --> 41:15.300
Happening?
Nothings happening.

41:15.377 --> 41:18.141
We was, uh...
We was looking for a suitcase.

41:18.213 --> 41:20.579
Uh, Primo wanted us to get
a suitcase for the honeymoon.

41:20.649 --> 41:23.277
Were we hit by lightning?

41:24.386 --> 41:26.547
Something like that.

41:26.622 --> 41:28.996
It's night time.
What happened to the wedding?

41:28.997 --> 41:30.080
That was yesterday.

41:30.159 --> 41:33.458
Yesterday?
You got a concussion.

41:33.529 --> 41:35.759
Lightning can do that.

41:35.831 --> 41:38.095
<i>Either Ziggy's blown it again,</i>

41:38.167 --> 41:41.534
<i>or whoever's bouncing me around in time</i>
<i>isn't letting me off the hook. </i>

41:41.603 --> 41:43.812
<i>I was put here to do something,
and now that I was Don Gino,</i>

41:43.813 --> 41:45.667
<i>I finally knew what it was. </i>

41:46.341 --> 41:50.471
Teresa, do you love Frankie?

41:53.115 --> 41:55.049
Yeah.

41:55.117 --> 41:57.347
And Frankie, do you love Teresa?

41:57.419 --> 41:59.444
Love Teresa?

41:59.521 --> 42:02.513
Godfather, anyone even
looks at Teresa, it's...

42:02.591 --> 42:06.118
What if it wasn't...
Do you love her?

42:09.031 --> 42:13.559
With all due respect, Godfather,
I love her so much it hurts.

42:13.635 --> 42:16.832
Oh, Frankie.
Terrific.

42:16.905 --> 42:19.840
What's best for all of us
is for you two to be together.

42:19.908 --> 42:22.843
The trouble is as soon as I put
you together, I'm outta here,

42:22.911 --> 42:25.641
the old Gino is back,
and you end up like Jimmy Hoffa.

42:25.714 --> 42:28.239
Running the Teamsters?

42:28.317 --> 42:30.649
Wow!

42:30.719 --> 42:34.485
I gotta find a way to let all of Brooklyn
know that I approve of your liaison...

42:34.556 --> 42:36.751
a way that Gino can...

42:39.728 --> 42:42.856
a way that Gino can't back out of.

42:42.931 --> 42:44.865
Relax.

42:53.442 --> 42:57.708
Banns of marriage, they
have to be formally announced.

42:57.779 --> 43:00.339
I understand. But, uh,
couldn't you sort of formally...

43:00.415 --> 43:02.883
announce it informally now?

43:04.786 --> 43:07.016
At bingo?
Please.

43:11.026 --> 43:14.894
I have an announcement to make.

43:16.665 --> 43:20.863
Don Gino Frascotti
wishes it to be known that...

43:22.604 --> 43:26.540
Frankie La Palma and Teresa Pacchi...

43:28.176 --> 43:32.272
are to be married...
with his blessing.

43:34.850 --> 43:38.684
Gino, grazie. Mille grazie.

43:38.754 --> 43:41.416
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.
I'm dyin'.

43:41.490 --> 43:44.721
One more thing.

43:44.793 --> 43:47.227
From now on, you're
out of the family business.

43:47.296 --> 43:49.890
I don't care what you do.
Have Teresa teach you how to cut hair.

43:49.965 --> 43:53.230
- But no more banga-banga. Capisce?
- Capisce.

44:04.780 --> 44:06.714
Congratulations, Don Gino.

44:30.272 --> 44:34.333
Ladies, if you'll take your seats
now, we'll finish this card.

44:34.409 --> 44:37.276
- Didn't work, huh?
- My idea or Ziggy's?

44:37.346 --> 44:40.315
The both of them
were "flopperoonis. "

44:42.584 --> 44:45.382
Are you warm enough?

44:45.454 --> 44:49.390
Yeah, well, you know... the desert. You
burn up in the daytime. You freeze at night.

44:49.458 --> 44:53.724
It's gonna warm up though, because
Ziggy's gonna turn the support systems back on.

44:53.795 --> 44:56.127
He gave up on me, did he?

44:56.198 --> 45:00.294
Well, he blames you for not following
his instructions down to the decimal.

45:00.369 --> 45:03.031
There's more to it than that.
I'll say there is.

45:03.105 --> 45:06.802
Who ever heard of one lousy hair dryer
blacking out all of the East Coast?

45:06.875 --> 45:09.537
No, that's not what I mean.
Or maybe it is what I mean.

45:09.611 --> 45:12.409
Look, whatever I was put here
to do didn't get done.

45:12.481 --> 45:14.847
And now that I've leaped
from Frankie to Gino,

45:14.916 --> 45:17.384
maybe it can't be done.

45:17.452 --> 45:22.446
Al, what... what if I have to live
the next 40 years as a Mafia don?

45:22.524 --> 45:24.685
No chance, no chance.
How do you know?

45:24.760 --> 45:28.218
Because Gino gets knocked off
by the Carluccis in April.

45:28.296 --> 45:32.130
- <i>And we have an I-22.</i>
- Relax. I know what you're here to do.

45:35.937 --> 45:38.428
N-42?

45:38.507 --> 45:41.704
Yeah.

45:44.813 --> 45:48.749
<i>G- 52.</i>
<i>G-52?</i>

45:56.625 --> 45:58.559
Be my guest.

46:16.144 --> 46:18.772
- B-8.
- Bingo!

46:22.284 --> 46:24.218
Bingo.
