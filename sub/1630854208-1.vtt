WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.537
Previously on The Equalizer...
(engine revving)

00:03.637 --> 00:04.905
ROBYN:
Delilah,

00:05.005 --> 00:07.275
I want you to meet two
of the best people I know.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.976
Harry and this is...

00:09.077 --> 00:10.444
Oh!
...Mel.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.646
Robyn, I need to know

00:12.746 --> 00:14.715
that you're not putting
my daughter at risk.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.050
(gunfire)

00:16.150 --> 00:17.351
DELILAH:
No!

00:17.451 --> 00:19.087
You have kids?

00:19.187 --> 00:20.221
(chuckles)

00:20.321 --> 00:21.655
Nice try.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.957
Delilah Fulton?
I'm Detective Dante.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.194
Does the name "Mason Quinn"
mean anything to you?

00:26.294 --> 00:27.661
ROBYN:
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:27.761 --> 00:29.130
People that tangle
with Quinn end up dead.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.131
Bishop.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.532
I will always win.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.800
I'm gonna catch you again.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.368
And this time,
I'm gonna kill you.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.170
Omar Delgado.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.638
Former Cuban intelligence

00:37.738 --> 00:39.373
turned freelance militant.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.774
Robyn...
If we find Delgado,

00:40.874 --> 00:42.643
he'll lead us
right back to Quinn.

00:42.743 --> 00:43.744
(groans)

00:43.844 --> 00:45.012
Who are you?

00:45.113 --> 00:46.414
Carter Griffin. CIA.

00:46.514 --> 00:47.815
From Cuban intelligence.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.184
Delgado's contacts
in the U.S.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.752
And, Carter,

00:51.852 --> 00:53.954
Quinn cannot see me coming.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.022
What's coming?

00:55.123 --> 00:56.056
(explosion)

00:56.157 --> 00:57.391
(indistinct shouting)

00:57.491 --> 00:58.759
Told you they'd find me.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.329
And that's
how you gain their trust.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.430
Our models show
the radiation cloud

01:02.530 --> 01:04.332
will affect most of Manhattan.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.400
He's talking about a dirty bomb.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.635
There's something going on

01:07.735 --> 01:09.703
that you both need
to know about.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.739
And I'm going
to have...
Mom!

01:12.540 --> 01:14.875
(tires screeching)
(Delilah yells)

01:18.011 --> 01:19.180
(high-pitched ringing)

01:19.280 --> 01:20.214
(sirens wailing)
(Vi speaking indistinctly)

01:20.314 --> 01:21.215
(crashing)

01:21.315 --> 01:23.184
(Vi speaking indistinctly)

01:23.284 --> 01:24.185
DELILAH:
Mom!

01:24.285 --> 01:25.786
Dee.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.621
Dee, did you
see the plate?

01:27.721 --> 01:31.325
Uh... no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.227
Oh, uh, it had
one of those, um,

01:33.327 --> 01:35.229
bar things on the...
on the grille.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.230
A brush guard?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.431
Delilah?

01:37.531 --> 01:38.832
I've got it.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.033
Detective Dante.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.002
(exhales)
I heard about the abduction.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.505
I didn't realize...
Are you okay?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.307
No. No, I'm-I'm not.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.409
(stammers)
Some men, they...

01:48.509 --> 01:49.777
I mean, they took my mom.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.812
Don't worry.
We're gonna find her.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.081
I'm Detective Dante.
We met at the precinct...

01:54.182 --> 01:56.250
Yes, after Jason's
shooting. I remember.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.986
Do you guys have a photo we can
use to help find your mom?

02:03.191 --> 02:04.258
Is there a problem?

02:04.358 --> 02:05.926
It's okay.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.830
We have to.

02:16.804 --> 02:20.073
DANTE:
Wait. You got to be kidding me.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.181
Okay.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.687
Can you describe
Robyn's assailant?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.623
Um, white male.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.591
Uh, about six feet.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.460
Um, dark hair,
cut short.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.528
(line ringing)
He was wearing a...

02:40.628 --> 02:42.330
a light brown jacket,

02:42.430 --> 02:44.298
dark pants,
I think, and...

02:44.398 --> 02:45.666
What? Delilah.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.001
Delilah, slow down.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.438
Oh, my God.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.672
HARRY: Nothing
on the street cams.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.106
Whoever did this
must've known to hit Rob

02:53.207 --> 02:54.174
in a blind spot.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.576
Not "whoever."

02:55.676 --> 02:56.810
Mason Quinn.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.846
After what McCall told us
about Delgado

02:58.946 --> 03:02.049
and Quinn's plan for the
dirty bomb, this has to be him.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.618
HARRY:
Quinn must've found out that
Robyn was trying to stop him.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.153
Yeah.
Yeah, what
I don't understand is,

03:06.254 --> 03:08.121
why take her instead of
just taking her out?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.924
This is why I didn't want
her going after Quinn.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.826
He warned her.
I knew that this would happen.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.262
All right, look,
there's nothing here.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.829
We got to try something else.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.668
What about Delgado's
lists of contacts

03:20.768 --> 03:22.636
that McCall stole
from the Cuban embassy?

03:22.736 --> 03:23.671
Maybe someone there
knows the plan.

03:23.771 --> 03:24.838
All right. It's worth a try.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.440
It's gonna take a while.
(sighs)

03:26.540 --> 03:28.509
God, this is
such a nightmare.

03:29.777 --> 03:30.978
Oh, poor Delilah.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.079
How did she sound?

03:32.179 --> 03:33.213
Terrified.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.615
As she should be.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.050
The worst part is
there's nothing she can do.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.553
She did do something.
She called us.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.657
And we're not gonna
let her down.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.629
* *

03:53.301 --> 03:55.803
No! That's not it!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.838
The face was
more rounded.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.206
The eyes were
deeper. I...

03:59.307 --> 04:01.542
It's a process. It takes time.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.778
My niece
doesn't have time!

04:06.146 --> 04:08.416
Oh, God, just
give it to me.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.050
(water pouring)

04:11.352 --> 04:13.554
(sighs)

04:21.495 --> 04:23.063
How you holding up?

04:23.864 --> 04:26.934
I don't-- I don't really
know right now. (sighs)

04:27.034 --> 04:28.336
I just...

04:28.436 --> 04:30.704
I can't believe that this
is happening. (shudders)

04:32.205 --> 04:33.907
You know, I recently went
through something

04:34.007 --> 04:36.209
I didn't think
I'd make it back from.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.647
I was convinced
my life was over.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.717
Was it that, uh...

04:43.817 --> 04:45.953
that thing in Gatling County?

04:48.956 --> 04:51.058
Point is,
I had to stay positive.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.927
Especially
in the darkest moments.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.997
And you know
who helped me do that?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.231
Your mom.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.302
It's gonna be okay.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.204
We have to believe that.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.474
Besides,
I know your mom.

05:06.574 --> 05:10.110
Frankly, I'm more worried
about the guys who took her.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.645
(chuckles softly)

05:11.745 --> 05:13.347
(sniffles)

05:15.816 --> 05:17.751
Delilah! Delilah.
Oh, my God.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.553
Oh, God, sweetie,
I am so sorry.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.154
Are you okay?

05:21.254 --> 05:22.856
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just, you know, Mom.
I know.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.958
I know it's scary,
but your mom is

05:25.058 --> 05:27.361
the toughest person
I know, okay?
Okay.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.367
(sighs)

05:33.467 --> 05:35.002
Dirty bombs?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.770
MEL:
Set to be deployed
a week from now.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.006
I don't know how many
you have on your team,

05:39.106 --> 05:41.409
but you need to
mobilize everybody.
Yeah.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.710
I'm gonna hit the streets

05:42.810 --> 05:43.744
and try to find the SUV
that took Robyn.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.978
It's a needle in a haystack,

05:45.078 --> 05:46.079
but it's the best lead
we've got.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.781
Okay.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.217
This is one of the men
who took Robyn.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.285
Great job.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.788
I'll distribute this
to the department.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.224
Hi.
(chuckles softly)

05:57.324 --> 05:58.726
You don't know me,
but I'm, uh...

05:58.826 --> 06:00.227
Too well-dressed
to be a cop.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.763
And the way you just
hugged Dee tells me

06:02.863 --> 06:04.498
that you work
with Robyn.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.166
You're the woman
who owns the bar.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.001
Mel, right?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.136
Right.

06:10.337 --> 06:13.206
I wish we were meeting
under better circumstances,

06:13.306 --> 06:15.443
but I want you to know--

06:15.543 --> 06:18.378
we are going to find her.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.883
But why would someone
do this to Robyn?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.053
That's what
we're gonna find out.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.429
* *

06:39.633 --> 06:42.169
* *

06:50.878 --> 06:52.913
* *

06:54.314 --> 06:56.550
(coughing)

07:00.754 --> 07:02.623
(exhales sharply)

07:05.626 --> 07:08.929
Quinn, I know you're on
the other end of that thing.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.564
(buzzing)

07:12.933 --> 07:14.935
* *

07:22.009 --> 07:23.911
I promise you. (panting)

07:24.011 --> 07:26.379
If you did anything
to hurt my family,

07:26.480 --> 07:28.181
I will end you!

07:28.281 --> 07:30.584
You got that, Quinn?!

07:31.685 --> 07:34.321
You hear me?
How long before
we can get rid of her?

07:34.421 --> 07:38.391
QUINN: Soon. It's almost done.
Go take care of the SUV.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.264
* *

07:44.364 --> 07:45.566
You reach Carter Griffin?

07:45.666 --> 07:46.800
HARRY (over phone):
Yeah.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.135
He arranged a sit-down

07:48.235 --> 07:50.504
for you and Omar Delgado
at the CIA black site

07:50.604 --> 07:52.305
where he's being held.
Good.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.774
If this is about Quinn
and those bombs,

07:53.874 --> 07:55.108
then Delgado might
know something

07:55.208 --> 07:56.644
about where McCall's being held.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.979
Yeah, like where Quinn's
base of operations is located.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.981
Then again, Delgado's been
at that black site

08:01.081 --> 08:02.149
since before McCall was grabbed.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.350
So he may know nothing.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.718
Well, whatever he knows,

08:04.818 --> 08:06.153
you can be damn sure
he's gonna tell me.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.622
* *

08:25.138 --> 08:27.040
I hate this.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.012
I just...

08:32.112 --> 08:34.081
I feel so helpless.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.383
(sighs)

08:38.285 --> 08:39.987
Yeah, I know, baby.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.995
But your mother is going
to be okay.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.700
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

08:54.668 --> 08:56.536
There is literally no way
for them to actually know that.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.005
Okay? Mom was kidnapped.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.409
There were men with guns
and everyone is acting

09:02.509 --> 09:04.612
like it's not as horrible
as it really is.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.380
We're just trying to
stay positive, Dee.
Okay, well, I can't!

09:08.649 --> 09:10.350
Ever since Bishop died,
it is like...

09:10.450 --> 09:11.719
it's like she's been possessed.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.955
Just out there,
day and night, doing...

09:16.056 --> 09:17.290
...whatever it is
she does.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.959
Your mother
is helping people.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.861
Well, I wish for once
she would just worry about

09:20.961 --> 09:22.630
helping herself.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.600
(crying)

09:26.700 --> 09:29.670
I knew something bad
was going to happen to her.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.740
And I told her that, and she
did not listen, and now..

09:34.708 --> 09:36.443
Now she could be...

09:36.543 --> 09:38.712
(takes deep breath)

09:38.812 --> 09:40.147
She could be dead, Aunt Vi.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.917
Dee, you listen to me.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.754
Your mother has

09:46.854 --> 09:48.722
a lot of really good people
out there looking for her.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.290
People that she trusts.

09:50.390 --> 09:53.160
If she believes in them,

09:53.260 --> 09:55.796
we have to do the same.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.501
I'm really scared, Aunt Vi.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.472
I just want her to come home.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.680
Oh, God. Me, too, baby.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.820
* *

10:30.463 --> 10:32.365
OFFICER:
Detective Dante, do you copy?

10:32.465 --> 10:33.767
This is Dante. Go ahead.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.602
The BOLO you just put out
on that SUV

10:35.703 --> 10:37.570
with the brush grille, a vehicle
matching that description

10:37.671 --> 10:39.973
was just spotted heading east,
nearing Murray Park.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.542
Do not engage.
I repeat, do not engage.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.144
On my way.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.414
(tires screeching)

10:53.253 --> 10:54.988
* *

11:06.499 --> 11:08.135
That's a pretty nice ride.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.469
(sighs)

11:09.569 --> 11:11.038
Sure you want to do that?

11:13.741 --> 11:16.643
I suggest you walk
away while you can.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.311
Fraid I can't do that.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.646
Detective Dante, NYPD.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.982
I've got a few
questions for you.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.450
On the ground. Now!

11:32.425 --> 11:34.862
(grunting)

11:51.111 --> 11:53.280
(panting)

11:53.380 --> 11:54.948
Now let's try this again.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.885
Where's the woman you grabbed?

11:57.985 --> 12:00.087
You really think I'm gonna
tell you anything?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.923
Just get it over with
and arrest me.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.325
Right.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.595
Cause I'm a cop, you think
I got to play by the rules.

12:09.763 --> 12:12.299
A few things to keep in mind:

12:12.399 --> 12:14.935
One is-- that woman you took?

12:15.035 --> 12:18.205
I care a lot more about her
than my badge right now.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.874
The other--

12:20.974 --> 12:24.211
you're lying
in a pool of gasoline.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.214
(flicks open lighter)

12:30.217 --> 12:32.519
Now, I don't smoke...

12:32.619 --> 12:34.788
but I'm willing to bet you do.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.558
So I'm gonna ask again.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.060
Where'd you take her?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.162
(whimpering)

12:43.330 --> 12:45.165
MEL:
Thanks for setting this up,
Griffin.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.968
Not sure what you expect
to get out of him.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.037
Even if he knows where Quinn
might have taken McCall,

12:50.137 --> 12:52.239
she and I already tricked him
into talking once.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.542
He didn't appreciate that.
Hasn't said a word since.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.110
Well, let me
at least try.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.313
It's McCall.
I've got to do something.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.051
(door closes)

13:04.151 --> 13:06.286
MEL: Where can
I find Quinn?

13:07.187 --> 13:10.290
Where is his base
of operations?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.691
Fine.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.360
Don't answer me.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.162
You can play
the loyal soldier.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.563
But understand this.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.099
Quinn disposes of the people
that he works with

13:19.199 --> 13:21.368
the minute they lose
their usefulness to him,

13:21.468 --> 13:24.237
which believe me, you have.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.977
These people?

13:30.077 --> 13:32.245
They all thought they were
Quinn's right-hand man

13:32.345 --> 13:35.148
right up until the moment
he had them killed.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.718
You're no
different, Omar.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.621
You think you're his partner.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.490
You think
you're gonna be rewarded

13:43.590 --> 13:45.492
for your loyalty somehow.

13:45.592 --> 13:50.263
But the only thing you are
to that man is a loose end.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.734
The other woman. McCall.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.303
Why are you here and not her?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.071
Don't worry about her.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.608
Quinn got to her already?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.676
(scoffs)
She fell right into his hands.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.612
Hey!
You need to focus on me

14:05.712 --> 14:07.647
because I am
your only protection.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.182
You want to live
to see tomorrow,

14:09.282 --> 14:10.550
you better start talking.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.187
If Quinn has your friend,
there is no tomorrow.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.323
What does that mean?

14:17.790 --> 14:20.193
It means that America will pay

14:20.293 --> 14:21.995
for imposing its will.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.297
Thinking it can
police the world.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.665
Pay?

14:25.765 --> 14:27.734
Are you talking
about the dirty bombs?

14:27.834 --> 14:30.037
(coughing)

14:32.605 --> 14:33.673
Omar.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.275
Omar-- Omar!

14:36.409 --> 14:38.045
GRIFFIN:
What happened?!

14:38.145 --> 14:39.579
I think he's going
into cardiac arrest.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.049
(grunting)

14:42.149 --> 14:44.417
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.286
Keep going?
Nothing. Damn it.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.023
Quinn got to him.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.491
Poisoned his
cigarette.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.725
He said, "There is no tomorrow."

14:52.825 --> 14:54.127
Yeah.
What does that mean?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.629
There's only one thing
it can mean.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.132
The timetable
has been moved up.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.135
The bombs could go off
at any time.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.644
* *

15:11.744 --> 15:13.246
Hey.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.448
If those bombs are going off
tonight, we have to move fast.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.950
Starting with warning the city.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.451
It's not that simple.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.420
That's a decision
above our pay grade.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.056
What's there to decide?
Lives are at stake.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.791
The public needs to know.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.359
Yes, but it's a process.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.596
Let me run it up the chain
of command and I'll call you.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.100
Yeah, you do that.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.334
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Tonight?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.802
Uh-huh.
Are you sure?

15:35.902 --> 15:38.071
Yeah, when Delgado heard
that Quinn already had McCall,

15:38.171 --> 15:40.173
he said,
"There is no tomorrow."

15:40.273 --> 15:41.541
Grabbing her
must've accelerated

15:41.641 --> 15:43.176
the timeline somehow.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.577
I mean, a-a blast,

15:44.677 --> 15:47.080
any blast in a populated area
is bad enough...

15:47.180 --> 15:48.781
Yeah.
...but the radiation
from a dirty bomb

15:48.881 --> 15:51.318
could cause the deaths
of-of thousands people.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.519
Slow deaths.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.820
Yeah, while making
parts of the city

15:53.920 --> 15:56.889
uninhabitable for years.
(phone ringing)

15:56.990 --> 15:58.325
Griffin.
Talk to me.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.692
Are you gonna alert
the city now?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.461
I'm afraid that's a negative.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.896
What?
The powers that be don't
want to start a panic.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.565
They feel that an alert

16:05.665 --> 16:08.035
would lead to more lives lost
if everyone's trying to

16:08.135 --> 16:09.736
get out of the city at once.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.171
They feel we stand
a better chance

16:11.271 --> 16:12.705
at stopping the threat
ourselves.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.907
Are you kidding me?
That is not our call to make.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.876
Yeah, it's theirs.
And they've made it.

16:16.976 --> 16:17.944
AGENT:
Let's go!

16:18.045 --> 16:19.512
Go, go! All right, move out!

16:19.612 --> 16:20.747
Let's move it!
Look, I got to go.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.215
I'll keep you posted
on what we find.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.418
No, screw that.
We can warn them ourselves.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.387
A few keystrokes,
and every newsfeed

16:27.487 --> 16:29.522
in the city...
No, wait. Don't.
(groans)

16:29.622 --> 16:32.792
As much as I hate to admit it,
they might be right.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.862
Sounding the alarm now
will only cause mass panic.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.765
It's up to us to stop
the bombs from going off.

16:38.865 --> 16:39.932
Yeah.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.368
(sighs)

16:41.468 --> 16:43.002
I guess I'm canceling
that couples massage.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.837
Okay, in order to stop them,

16:44.937 --> 16:46.639
we have to know
where they are first.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.276
We know Delgado said,
"The targets are chosen."

16:49.376 --> 16:50.777
Other than that,
we're in the dark.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.379
Well, I mean,
somebody's got to know.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.946
Delgado wasn't gonna plant
all of them himself.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.116
Anything on his
Cuban embassy list?

16:56.216 --> 16:58.451
It's tons of information.
I'm still scrubbing through it.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.853
Okay, meanwhile, I'll bring
Dante up to speed...

17:01.821 --> 17:03.490
What?

17:04.824 --> 17:07.160
Aunt Vi and Delilah.
We have to warn them.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.062
I know Carter said
not to warn anybody, but--

17:09.162 --> 17:10.930
No, no, no. They're not
"anybody," all right?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.165
They're family.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.633
Robyn would want them
to leave town.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.068
Okay.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.739
VI:
Dirty bombs?

17:19.839 --> 17:21.341
Good Lord.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.244
So, does this have something
to do with why they took Mom?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.745
We think so.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.949
You can't mention this
to anyone.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.387
So what are we supposed
to do now?

17:34.487 --> 17:37.557
Harry and I are going to do
everything we can to stop it.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.526
And what if you can't?
I'm not planning on it

17:39.626 --> 17:41.294
coming to that,
but just in case,

17:41.394 --> 17:43.930
you both need
to leave town.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.865
Immediately.
(inhales)

17:46.933 --> 17:48.235
What about Robyn?

17:48.335 --> 17:50.603
We're gonna
take care of her.

17:50.703 --> 17:55.142
But I know she would want
you guys to get to safety.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.046
MEL:
I have to go.
So should you.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.750
(quietly): Hey,
I promise to call you

18:03.850 --> 18:06.486
with any updates, okay?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.321
Okay.
All right.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.356
Mel...

18:09.456 --> 18:10.690
Yeah?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.625
Thank you.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.969
(sighing):
Okay.

18:23.069 --> 18:27.140
Only take what you need.
Essentials. Small bag.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.311
(inhales) H-How is this fair?

18:31.411 --> 18:33.346
I mean, I mean,
we get to

18:33.446 --> 18:38.751
sneak away while everyone has
to stay here and-and die?

18:38.851 --> 18:42.088
I mean, what about...
What about my friends?

18:42.189 --> 18:45.358
Dad and Kelly?
Trish?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.026
I mean, what are they
supposed to do?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.196
Dee, baby, I hear where
you're coming from,

18:49.296 --> 18:51.564
but the important thing right
now is to get us to safety.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.266
We can discuss
how to tell them

18:53.366 --> 18:55.302
on the way.
It's not right.

18:55.402 --> 18:56.836
I mean,

18:56.936 --> 18:58.405
what if we can help find her?

18:58.505 --> 18:59.806
We need to be here.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.709
Did you hear what she just said?
We have to go!

19:02.809 --> 19:04.010
Leave if you want.
I'm not going.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.179
Delilah Fulton!
We don't have time for this.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.548
We are leaving!

19:08.648 --> 19:11.050
Now, go get your bag ready.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.686
I am sorry, Aunt Vi.
But I am not leaving Mom.

19:16.256 --> 19:19.592
I'm not leaving everyone
that we care about behind.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.695
* *

19:25.598 --> 19:27.467
(phone ringing)

19:27.567 --> 19:29.469
Dante, I hope you have
good news.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.637
Could be.
I found the SUV

19:30.737 --> 19:32.071
that was used to grab Robyn.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.640
I might know where
they're holding her.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.742
How?
You checked the GPS history?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.109
Ah, something like that.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.778
Send me the address.
I'll meet you there.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.413
Better hurry.
With the timeline moved up,

19:40.513 --> 19:42.014
I don't plan on waiting around.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.251
Hey.
It won't do Robyn any good

19:44.351 --> 19:46.553
if you get picked off
before we can save her.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.720
We need to have

19:47.820 --> 19:50.022
a plan of attack.
I'm listening.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.525
Hold on.
(beeps)

19:52.625 --> 19:53.893
(phone ringing)

19:53.993 --> 19:55.161
HARRY:
Yeah, what's up?

19:55.262 --> 19:56.996
Harry, Dante thinks
he has a bead

19:57.096 --> 19:58.765
on Rob's location.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.267
We need whatever
you can find on the building--

20:00.367 --> 20:01.901
schematics, sewer tunnels,
possible points of entry.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.570
All right, yeah,
give me the address.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.238
How reliable is this info?

20:05.338 --> 20:06.539
I'm sorry, who is this?

20:06.639 --> 20:07.840
Dante, meet Harry.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.376
He's a wizard
at this kind of stuff.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.577
Ah, she's exaggerating.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.778
A wizard implies
something magical.

20:11.878 --> 20:12.879
I'm more like a genius.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.314
Oh, so you're a computer guy.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.583
He's basically a better-looking
version of Siri.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.984
But he'll never make you
say "ducking."

20:18.084 --> 20:19.118
(chuckles)

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
HARRY:
All right, the address?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.588
She's at 37 Atlantic Ave.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.890
All right. Stand by.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.659
Oh, that's interesting.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.695
The building was previously used

20:28.795 --> 20:30.196
by a private contractor
for the military.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.364
Meaning...?

20:31.464 --> 20:32.565
Meaning the place
is a fortress.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.600
I mean, it's gonna
take me a minute

20:33.700 --> 20:35.335
to find a good entry point.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.270
Dante, I'll meet you there.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.772
Please hurry. Both of you.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.711
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

20:47.013 --> 20:47.814
Let's go.

20:47.914 --> 20:48.881
I'm not going anywhere

20:48.981 --> 20:50.116
until I speak to Quinn.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.250
Move.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.719
Now!

20:53.720 --> 20:55.722
I heard you
the first time.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.291
You saying it louder
is not gonna make me

20:58.391 --> 21:00.092
any more afraid of you.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.330
I said...
(grunting)

21:04.564 --> 21:07.099
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

21:10.770 --> 21:12.439
QUINN:
Easy, McCall.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.574
I don't want
to have to kill you.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.042
Not yet.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.711
* *

21:25.418 --> 21:27.186
(phone buzzing)

21:28.455 --> 21:29.589
DANTE:
Detective Dante.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.691
Hey, it's Harry.
I got into their system.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.460
The place is crawling
with security.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.994
Good news is
I can help you dodge it.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.330
Sounds like a plan.
The bad news is

21:37.430 --> 21:39.366
that their, uh, security cameras
are controlled by a server

21:39.466 --> 21:41.133
which randomly regenerates
an access code

21:41.233 --> 21:43.235
every 30 seconds, so it keeps
kicking me off-line.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.372
And here I thought you were
supposed to be the man.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.139
You know, I'm gonna chalk
that comment up to the fact

21:47.239 --> 21:48.841
that we're all under
a lot of stress here.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.377
But don't be surprised
if one day

21:50.477 --> 21:51.578
you end up being subscribed to

21:51.678 --> 21:53.346
an Exotic Animal
of the Month club.

21:53.446 --> 21:56.383
(chuckles)
Hold on.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.084
I've been spotted.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.253
This is a restricted area.
You need to move the car.

22:01.354 --> 22:04.156
Sorry, man, I got turned around
trying to find this address.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.358
Hey.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.060
You think you can help me
find this place?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.229
(grunts)

22:11.698 --> 22:13.232
(grunts)

22:14.701 --> 22:16.903
Hello?
What-What's going on?

22:19.372 --> 22:20.373
I'm going in.

22:20.473 --> 22:21.674
Without Mel?

22:21.774 --> 22:22.742
Do I really need to list
all the reasons

22:22.842 --> 22:24.276
why that's a terrible idea?

22:24.377 --> 22:25.645
Look, the party's started.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.013
As soon as that guard misses

22:27.113 --> 22:29.348
a check-in, we lose
the element of surprise.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.386
(beeping)

22:35.822 --> 22:37.990
How we doing?

22:38.090 --> 22:40.860
Not good. You got two bogies
in the stairwell behind you.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.070
I'm beginning to see
why Robyn keeps you around.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.639
And here I thought
it was for my collection

22:52.739 --> 22:54.807
of rare salvaged denim.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.844
Which way, Harry?

22:57.944 --> 22:59.679
I-- Wait, I...
I don't know.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.949
The system kicked me off.
I'm rebooting now.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.691
On the ground.
Hands out.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.125
Easy...

23:13.225 --> 23:16.963
Hey, man, let's
talk about this.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.231
(grunts)

23:19.331 --> 23:20.933
Just couldn't wait, huh?

23:22.034 --> 23:23.102
HARRY:
Okay. All right, guys.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.403
All right, I'm back.
All right, so...

23:24.504 --> 23:26.105
keep going straight,
then bear left.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.607
There should be a stairwell.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.208
Take it up to the seventh floor,
where it looks like

23:29.308 --> 23:31.243
three guards
are posted at a door.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.745
Got it.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.081
* *

23:37.584 --> 23:39.418
You're gonna want to ice that.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.221
Why dirty bombs, Quinn?

23:42.321 --> 23:44.924
Why make thousands of
innocent people suffer?

23:45.024 --> 23:48.495
It's cruel, even for you.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.762
They're not innocent.

23:49.862 --> 23:53.466
This city is a false
beacon of freedom,

23:53.566 --> 23:56.102
and I'm gonna tear it all down.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.871
This is not about America.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.508
You're auditioning
for our enemies.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.109
So, who's paying you?

24:03.209 --> 24:05.812
China? Russia?
North Koreans?

24:05.912 --> 24:07.580
Not auditioning.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.115
Putting them all on notice.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.918
So... when it comes down to it,

24:12.018 --> 24:14.954
you're just a glorified merc.

24:15.822 --> 24:18.457
A gun for hire? That it?

24:18.558 --> 24:19.759
This is about power.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.094
World leaders will
trip over themselves

24:22.194 --> 24:24.564
lining up
to be in my favor

24:24.664 --> 24:26.499
for fear of being my enemy.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.067
Ah.

24:28.167 --> 24:32.539
And here I am thinking
you're overly ambitious...

24:33.506 --> 24:35.542
...when really
you're just plain old insane.

24:35.642 --> 24:39.011
Unfortunately, you won't
be around to see it happen.

24:39.111 --> 24:43.415
But don't worry,
your memory will live on.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.721
ROBYN: (scoffs)
What's this supposed to be?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.422
Some kind of manifesto?

24:50.523 --> 24:51.924
Your manifesto.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.226
(scoffs) Right.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.963
You're gonna blame this on me?

24:58.497 --> 25:00.132
Like anyone
is gonna believe you.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.468
On the contrary,
it's the perfect narrative.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.236
Disgruntled ex-CIA agent

25:04.336 --> 25:06.639
lashes out at
the country she feels

25:06.739 --> 25:07.974
has betrayed her.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.110
(scoffs)
You really are delusional.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.314
You can do what you want to me,

25:15.414 --> 25:18.117
but you'll never get me
to read that.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.686
But you already have.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.153
Why do you think
I grabbed you?

25:21.253 --> 25:22.989
ROBYN (on recording):
My name is Robyn McCall.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.456
I'm an ex-CIA operative.

25:24.557 --> 25:27.426
And America needs to pay
for its sins. Why?

25:27.526 --> 25:28.795
Uncanny, isn't it?

25:28.895 --> 25:31.998
As radiation spreads
across the city,

25:32.098 --> 25:34.801
I'll send this video
to newsrooms across the world.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.269
History will
remember you

25:37.369 --> 25:39.939
as nothing but
a homegrown terrorist.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.373
...by the time
you're seeing this,

25:41.473 --> 25:43.610
thousands of
Americans will be dead.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.779
The world needs to know
that I am responsible.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.180
* *

25:57.556 --> 25:58.758
HARRY:
It's the door on the left.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.092
I'm hacking the locks now.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.127
(lock whirs, clicks)

26:01.227 --> 26:02.561
Guards moved in a while ago.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.030
That's got to be
where they're keeping her.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.132
* *

26:12.939 --> 26:15.374
Oh, hold up.
I'll get the door for you.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.877
(lock whirs, clicks)

26:20.747 --> 26:22.782
DANTE:
Damn it. Too late.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.817
They knew
we were coming.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.889
* *

26:48.240 --> 26:49.942
They cleared out fast.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.744
Question is,
where were they going?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.680
No clue.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.516
But Quinn must need
something from her.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.986
Otherwise...
Why keep her alive?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.790
Maybe there's something on
those servers that can help us.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.391
HARRY:
I'm already on it.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.660
The servers were in the process
of wiping themselves.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.961
But I think I've recovered
most of the data.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.462
I'm scrubbing through
all of it now.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.032
What about the CIA prisoner?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.500
He say anything else
before he died?

27:14.600 --> 27:17.469
No. Just,
"There is no tomorrow."

27:17.569 --> 27:19.438
Guys...

27:19.538 --> 27:22.174
I-I think you should see this.

27:22.274 --> 27:25.211
My name is Robyn McCall.
I'm an ex-CIA operative.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.713
By the time
you're seeing this...
What the hell?

27:26.813 --> 27:29.315
...thousands of Americans
will be dead.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.750
No way she did
this willingly.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.184
They must've held
a gun to her head.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.120
Not even that
would make her do this.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.488
You guys are both right.
This is a deepfake.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.024
And a damn good one.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.760
As of 6:00 p.m. tonight,
the bomb will have detonated,

27:40.860 --> 27:43.329
shrouding the city
with radiation...

27:43.429 --> 27:44.764
6:00?

27:44.864 --> 27:46.465
That's sooner than we thought.

27:46.565 --> 27:47.967
We got to figure out
a way to stop this.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.668
How can we stop them
if we don't know

27:49.769 --> 27:50.703
where the targets are?

27:50.803 --> 27:52.004
Yeah, I don't know where,

27:52.104 --> 27:53.539
but I think I have
a pretty good idea

27:53.639 --> 27:54.673
as to how the bombs
are getting there.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.008
According to this time stamp,

27:56.108 --> 27:58.144
these three white vans
left the building

27:58.244 --> 28:00.646
just minutes before you guys
discovered Rob was gone.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.381
If Quinn is planning
on framing Robyn for this,

28:02.481 --> 28:04.616
how much you want to bet
she's in one of those vans?

28:04.717 --> 28:06.385
Harry, can you track
those vans?

28:06.485 --> 28:07.820
I got to find them first.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.255
I can't make out the plates
on any of them.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.522
Okay, I'll fill in Carter

28:10.622 --> 28:11.991
and get the CIA
to help us search.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.994
I'll put out a BOLO
for those vans.
Okay.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.964
(knocking on door)

28:18.064 --> 28:20.800
Okay, I got it.
Could be news about Mom.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.402
Dad?

28:23.502 --> 28:24.837
Uh, why are you here?

28:24.937 --> 28:26.172
Because I want
some damn answers.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.540
What the hell is your
mother mixed up in now?

28:30.076 --> 28:31.978
You know what?
Tell me in the car.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.212
Go get your bag.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.049
You called Dad?
You left me no choice.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.617
I don't care
if you're mad at me.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.220
Right now, my job is
to keep you safe and alive.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.688
Okay, well, I'm still
not going. Not until...

28:42.789 --> 28:44.656
Delilah. Enough.

28:44.757 --> 28:45.825
We're leaving.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.593
It is not right to leave Mom.

28:47.693 --> 28:50.162
It's not right to stay here
and die, either.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.933
Sweetheart, this isn't
what your mother would want.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.669
You know what?
You got no choice.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.507
Get in the car. Now!

29:01.607 --> 29:03.843
* *

29:11.417 --> 29:12.351
Found it, you son of a--

29:12.451 --> 29:13.920
Hey, Mel, Dante,

29:14.020 --> 29:17.189
Griffin, I found a GPS program
buried in Quinn's system.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.058
It's how he's been
tracking the vans.

29:19.158 --> 29:22.194
Dante, you need to head north
towards Hell's Kitchen.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.229
On my way.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.864
(siren wailing)

29:24.964 --> 29:26.132
Griffin, head east
at the next intersection,

29:26.232 --> 29:27.266
approaching 79th Street.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.767
Heading there now.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.402
Mel, you're about a mile out
from the third van.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.538
Copy that. Closing in.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.673
* *

29:35.541 --> 29:37.944
(turn signal clicking)

29:51.623 --> 29:53.259
(pants)

29:59.832 --> 30:02.334
Rob! Oh, thank God.
Oh!

30:02.434 --> 30:03.669
Dee, Aunt Vi?

30:03.769 --> 30:05.504
She's safe.
They're headed out of town.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.039
Thank you.
Yeah.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.807
I can't believe
I let this happen

30:08.908 --> 30:10.242
in front of my family.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.710
Dee must be...
She's stronger
than you think.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.945
She's okay.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.746
The important thing
is that you're safe.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.548
Quinn made
a video of me.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.950
Yeah, we saw it.
It's a deepfake.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.852
Now we have to stop
these bombs.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.220
We think
they're in vans.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.488
This one...

30:22.588 --> 30:24.456
and two other ones
heading to unknown targets.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.658
Okay?
Okay.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.661
(indistinct radio chatter)

30:30.729 --> 30:33.065
Approaching the van.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.667
What the hell?

30:35.767 --> 30:37.970
* *

30:41.040 --> 30:43.309
Negative, nothing here.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.214
MEL:
Harry, what the hell
is going on?

30:48.314 --> 30:49.848
A whole lot of nothing.
Dante and Griffin said

30:49.949 --> 30:51.183
the other two vans
are empty as well.

30:51.283 --> 30:53.485
Which is exactly
what Quinn wanted.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.354
Of course.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.823
He wanted us to find
that tracking program.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.892
Chase each one down,
spreading our resources out

30:59.992 --> 31:01.260
all over the city.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.694
To waste our time.

31:02.794 --> 31:04.263
Only 40 minutes left

31:04.363 --> 31:05.731
and we still have
no idea where to find them.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.733
* *

31:07.833 --> 31:10.069
(indistinct chatter)

31:17.276 --> 31:19.745
(beeping softly)

31:33.960 --> 31:35.494
* *

31:35.594 --> 31:38.564
Harry, what direction were
those other two vans headed?

31:38.664 --> 31:40.766
One to the Upper West Side,
the other to Brooklyn.

31:40.866 --> 31:43.169
And this one was
headed downtown.
Mm-hmm.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.937
Something's off.

31:45.837 --> 31:49.108
What if Quinn is drawing us
away from the actual locations?

31:49.208 --> 31:51.677
Or location. I was able
to recover a little more

31:51.777 --> 31:53.612
of that deepfake video.
Check it out.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.448
As of 6:00 p.m. tonight,
the bomb will have detonated,

31:56.548 --> 31:58.817
shrouding the city
with radiation.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.720
In the manifesto,
fake McCall says bomb,

32:01.820 --> 32:02.754
not bombs.

32:02.854 --> 32:03.889
I don't think that's a mistake.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.624
So if there's really
just one bomb,

32:05.724 --> 32:07.593
where would he put it?

32:08.394 --> 32:10.296
He would want it
to fit his narrative.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.064
To blame me.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.633
He would have to put my
body at the real location.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.702
Harry, did anything
in Quinn's system

32:16.802 --> 32:19.405
point to a single target
in Lower Manhattan?

32:20.306 --> 32:21.573
No. (exhales)

32:21.673 --> 32:23.009
Not in Quinn's system.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.610
But I looked into
the movements of Omar Delgado

32:24.710 --> 32:26.178
and all his contacts
from the embassy list.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.447
And it looks like they scouted
all over the city,

32:28.547 --> 32:30.182
including a few trips
to Liberty Park.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.118
Liberty Park?

32:32.218 --> 32:34.120
Quinn called America a
"false beacon of freedom."

32:34.220 --> 32:36.588
Liberty Park is right
by the Freedom Tower.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.591
A symbol of
America's resolve.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.560
Perfect place
to make a statement.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.595
And do the most damage.

32:43.695 --> 32:44.997
The irradiated dust cloud
would travel easily

32:45.097 --> 32:47.933
to Brooklyn, Queens,
New Jersey, Staten Island...

32:48.034 --> 32:51.103
Oh, my God.
Talk about bang for your buck.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.404
That's got to be it.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.306
Wait, Harry, if Quinn
is tracking the vans,

32:54.406 --> 32:55.774
he's gonna know
that we stopped them.

32:55.874 --> 32:57.909
No, I-I'm already on it.
I kept the signals moving

32:58.010 --> 32:59.278
just in case.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.579
We have less
than a half an hour.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.014
Harry, call Dante.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.116
We need the bomb squad
to search Liberty Park

33:04.216 --> 33:06.485
now.
Got it.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.120
(sirens wailing)

33:08.220 --> 33:10.889
OFFICER 1:
Everyone get back.
Clear the area.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.159
OFFICER 2:
Back off. Back to the line.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.194
Glad you're okay.
Thanks.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.828
You're gonna want
to see this.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.165
It's negative
for any leaks, Captain.

33:19.265 --> 33:22.601
Copy that. Clear out,
I'll take it from here.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.504
Captain McGuire, this is
the woman who called it in.

33:25.604 --> 33:26.538
She's with me.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.440
What are we looking at?

33:28.540 --> 33:31.377
One of the most deadly
devices I've ever seen.

33:32.411 --> 33:33.445
ROBYN:
Can you defuse it?

33:33.545 --> 33:35.847
Maybe if we had
four or five hours...

33:35.947 --> 33:37.683
We have minutes,
not hours, Captain.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.118
Well, then the best thing
we can do is get

33:39.218 --> 33:41.453
as many people out of
the blast radius as possible.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.589
But the radioactive dust...

33:45.491 --> 33:48.260
All right, officers.
Get everybody back. Now.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.895
Now!
All right, you heard him!

33:49.995 --> 33:51.363
Harry?

33:51.463 --> 33:52.731
What are you
doing here?

33:52.831 --> 33:53.932
Well, apparently this is
where the action is.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.301
Look, I was having
major bomb FOMO.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.002
No.
Listen, I want to help.

33:57.103 --> 33:58.670
I don't think there's
anything you can do.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.139
That anyone can do.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.808
I'm not so sure
about that.
Hey, what are you doing?

34:02.908 --> 34:04.476
You can't be seen
with a computer.

34:04.576 --> 34:05.877
So let them
arrest me, okay?

34:05.977 --> 34:08.614
I mean, if I can help save
the city, it's worth it.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.417
You know, and if I can't...
what difference does it make?

34:11.517 --> 34:13.085
Look, I discovered
one of Delgado's clients

34:13.185 --> 34:16.455
did time in South America
for a bunch of bombings.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.190
What if one
of those bombs

34:18.290 --> 34:20.126
can shed light on how
to defuse this one?

34:20.226 --> 34:21.660
And if it can't...

34:21.760 --> 34:23.562
I want to be with you.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.797
If we're gonna to go out,
let's do it together.

34:25.897 --> 34:29.034
No one's going out
just yet.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.137
Come on, there's got to
be something you can do.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.338
Maybe deactivate
the timer?

34:32.438 --> 34:34.140
That's just it.
There is no timer.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.175
Which means there's
a remote detonator.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.809
Radio signal,
most likely.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.212
What's the radius
on something like that?
Reliably?

34:40.312 --> 34:41.680
Quarter mile, maybe.

34:42.948 --> 34:45.851
Quinn's ego would never let him
leave this up to someone else.

34:45.951 --> 34:47.419
He's gonna
detonate it himself.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.020
Which means our best

34:49.121 --> 34:50.789
and only chance
at stopping this bomb

34:50.889 --> 34:52.224
from going off
is getting to Quinn

34:52.324 --> 34:53.659
before he presses
that button.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.295
Which means we have
15 minutes to find him.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.696
Quinn's gonna
stick around to watch,

34:57.796 --> 34:59.198
he's sure to have a quick
getaway planned, right?

34:59.298 --> 35:01.032
And there's only one place
in Manhattan you can do that.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.702
Rooftop helipad.
HARRY:
That's right.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.871
There's only three helipads
in Lower Manhattan.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.607
But only one of them
overlooks Liberty Park.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.176
MEL: That's
where he is.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.643
It has to be.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.912
I'm on my way.
MEL: Okay.

35:17.082 --> 35:18.049
(sirens wailing)

35:18.150 --> 35:19.818
DANTE:
Clear the area now!

35:19.918 --> 35:21.487
Everyone, we need this
area clear, please.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.289
Clear. This way.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.823
Turn around! Go!
DANTE: Keep moving,
keep moving, keep moving.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.493
-(clamoring)
-(whistles blowing)

35:30.362 --> 35:31.463
Harry, let's go.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.864
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.433
What are you doing?
You're not a munitions expert.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.702
I know, but you've always said
I was a quick learner.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.104
Hey, Captain, my name
is Harry Keshigian.

35:39.205 --> 35:41.807
Pretty good with puzzles.
Thought maybe I could help.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.809
You need to leave now
if you want to live.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.278
Traffic's really bad
this time of day.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.614
Might as well just
let me help.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.252
* *

35:53.352 --> 35:54.886
Prepare the chopper.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.726
You're too late, McCall.

36:07.098 --> 36:08.166
ROBYN:
Don't!

36:08.267 --> 36:10.269
(explosion)

36:11.470 --> 36:12.838
No.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.674
Harry. Mel!

36:15.774 --> 36:18.076
Somebody tell me you got
out of there in time.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.714
Harry? Mel?
(chuckles)

36:23.715 --> 36:25.584
You lose, McCall.

36:27.085 --> 36:29.955
Maybe, but you're gonna die
like the rest of us here.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.623
HARRY:
Hey, Rob?
Harry?

36:31.723 --> 36:34.326
Yes, we're okay.

36:34.426 --> 36:37.929
Covered in garbage,
but, you know, alive.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.898
I'm sorry, I tried to stop it,
but I couldn't.

36:39.998 --> 36:43.101
Yeah, about that...
Neither could we.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.305
But we managed to get everyone
to safety before we, uh...

36:46.405 --> 36:49.741
removed the radioactive
canister from the bomb.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.877
Wait, so...
HARRY: Yeah.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.380
We removed the dirty,
and left the bomb.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.548
We cleaned it, basically.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.851
My shirt... not so lucky.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.258
You lose, Quinn.

37:06.358 --> 37:09.361
The world is not even
gonna remember you existed.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.732
(grunts, chuckles)

37:13.832 --> 37:15.767
It's not over, McCall.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.636
I've got plenty more
deals to make

37:17.736 --> 37:19.471
with my old friends at the CIA.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.939
Not if I can help it.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.774
(chuckles)
But you can't.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.844
Haven't you learned?
Bishop was just the first.

37:25.944 --> 37:29.681
You better keep
your loved ones close.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.557
Nice job.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.158
Just keep him locked up.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.328
For good, this time.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.632
(grunts)
McCall!

37:47.733 --> 37:49.568
(grunting)

37:49.668 --> 37:51.870
(Quinn screaming)

37:55.507 --> 37:57.643
* *

38:04.383 --> 38:06.418
That's for Bishop.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.559
(indistinct radio chatter)

38:13.659 --> 38:15.894
(helicopter whirring)

38:22.167 --> 38:23.935
You might have
to retire that shirt.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.437
(chuckles)
I know.
I just bought it, too.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.940
Oh, I will buy you as
many shirts as you want.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.743
HARRY: Thanks.
What happened with Quinn?

38:33.044 --> 38:35.747
We will never have to worry
about him again.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.282
Ever.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.854
What I'm worried about is
explaining this

38:42.954 --> 38:44.656
to Aunt Vi and Dee.

38:44.756 --> 38:45.924
What do I say?

38:46.024 --> 38:47.726
Just tell them
the truth.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.960
The only thing

38:49.060 --> 38:51.229
they care about
is that you're safe.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.338
You had me worried.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.573
(chuckles softly)

39:01.673 --> 39:04.309
You're not getting rid
of me that easily.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.912
We're just getting started.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.250
The face behind
the voice.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.020
Thanks for
the assist back there.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.956
Hey, any friend of Rob's...

39:19.391 --> 39:20.726
So this is the team.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.861
* *

39:39.711 --> 39:42.347
Robyn?
ROBYN:
Hey.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.815
DELILAH:
Mom.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.517
My God.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.686
(Vi sobbing)

39:47.786 --> 39:50.355
Are you okay?
I'm okay. I'm okay.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.157
I'm so sorry.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.596
Hey, guys, wait.
Give me a minute.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.330
Miles, wait.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.834
(exhales)

40:02.934 --> 40:06.505
Look, I know you have
a lot of questions.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.474
I do.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.878
But now's not the time. Go.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.680
Be with Delilah.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.281
I'm glad you're okay.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.850
But Rob...

40:18.950 --> 40:22.153
this is far from over.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.491

40:25.591 --> 40:27.225
