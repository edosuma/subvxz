<i>- So, Ben, have you ever
sat for her?</i>

03:30.778 --> 03:32.878
- <i>God, no. No.</i>

03:32.880 --> 03:35.714
Her subjects are, um,
mothers, babies

03:35.716 --> 03:38.150
so she has no use for me.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.552
<i>- I've read
about your latest show.</i>

03:40.554 --> 03:42.487
Congratulations.

03:42.489 --> 03:46.091
It must be a real thrill to do
all that hard work come good.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.995
-Yeah, it went down a storm

03:49.997 --> 03:51.763
and she got a couple
of commissions

03:51.765 --> 03:53.665
which is always a bonus.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.602
<i>- Your success will really help
your application.</i>

03:56.604 --> 03:58.470
<i>Everyone here at the home
is thrilled</i>

03:58.472 --> 04:00.472
<i>that you've applied for custody.</i>

04:00.474 --> 04:01.974
<i>I know that
your recent relationship</i>

04:01.976 --> 04:03.742
<i>with your daughter
hasn't been easy</i>

04:03.744 --> 04:05.777
<i>but Chloe needs this
as much as you do.</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:28.967
-Hi, Chloe.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.307
-<i> I'll leave you to it.</i>

04:43.383 --> 04:45.217
- Wow, my photo of you
is really out of date.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.049
So, Louisa said that you were
thinking about our offer.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.395
Come and stay with us,
see how you feel.

04:56.397 --> 04:59.298
<i>We've got a great bedroom.</i>

04:59.300 --> 05:00.766
<i>The house is in a quiet
neighborhood,</i>

05:00.768 --> 05:02.034
<i>but it's just a short
train ride...</i>

05:02.036 --> 05:04.002
-why are you doing this?

05:06.239 --> 05:07.973
-I was hoping..

05:09.008 --> 05:10.542
Now that I've moved back
for good

05:10.544 --> 05:13.545
that you and I could spend
some time together.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.547
- Nine years ago
was when I needed you.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.318
Didn't want me then.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.090
-I did.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.560
I..

05:30.430 --> 05:32.397
<i>I... I..</i>

05:40.039 --> 05:42.174
-Don't come here again.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.210
<i>Don't call me.</i>

05:47.113 --> 05:49.448
Just leave me the fuck alone.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.085
Okay?

05:58.458 --> 06:03.395
-<i> Chloe, please don't leave.</i>

06:42.001 --> 06:44.236
<i>- Jess, you know how
important tonight is for me.</i>

06:44.238 --> 06:45.504
Will you please get ready?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.305
We're going to be late.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.941
Jess?

06:49.943 --> 06:52.077
I've already moved this dinner
twice because of you.

06:55.449 --> 06:58.350
- Tira, do you mind
if we pick this up next week?

06:58.352 --> 06:59.484
-Of course.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.820
- We need to leave
in 20 minutes.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.288
-Bye, Ben!

07:10.863 --> 07:12.364
Can you hold her?

07:12.366 --> 07:15.434
-Um, yeah.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.369
Okay. Hi.

07:17.371 --> 07:18.970
Oh.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.359
- Don't be sad
about your daughter.

07:44.897 --> 07:47.299
A mother's love for her child
is very powerful.

07:48.234 --> 07:49.668
<i>This is a talas.</i>

07:49.670 --> 07:51.303
<i>Its magic will help
your daughter</i>

07:51.305 --> 07:53.405
<i>see the love in your heart.</i>

07:53.407 --> 07:55.807
-It's pretty. Thank you.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.143
-You're welcome. Bye.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.099
-What?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.679
-<i> Fucking kids.</i>

08:37.851 --> 08:39.770
- Do you remember
when we used to play that game?

08:43.322 --> 08:44.789
You should see Mary's house now.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.625
They knocked down
the whole street.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.927
Come.
I wanna show you something.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.849
- But I haven't finished.
- It looks great to me.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.377
<i>You know kids are scared
to come here now?</i>

09:05.379 --> 09:06.745
<i>They say that 'cause Mary's dead</i>

09:06.747 --> 09:08.813
<i>there's no one left
to feed the demon.</i>

09:08.815 --> 09:10.415
<i>They reckon
it's still trapped in there</i>

09:10.417 --> 09:12.384
<i>waiting for someone to knock.</i>

09:12.386 --> 09:14.619
- Why are we even here?
You know I hate this place.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.254
- Once to wake her from her bed.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.656
Twice to raise her
from the dead.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.492
If you knock her door,
she still hears it.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.327
Sooner or later she comes
knockin' for you.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.763
- That's not funny.
She took Michael.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.464
-It's just a story.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.334
I'm sorry.
I, I didn't wanna upset you.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.958
<i>Look. I'll prove it to ya.</i>

10:00.633 --> 10:02.167
Gonna have a go?

10:59.358 --> 11:01.259
-Danny?

11:03.696 --> 11:04.996
Danny!

11:09.201 --> 11:11.770
- Hah!
- Oh, fuck!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.371
You are such a shit!
- That was great.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.240
-Why would you do that?

11:15.242 --> 11:17.876
-Your face.

11:17.878 --> 11:21.346
Wait, I'm sorry,
I'm joking, I'm joking.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.381
Come on. You alright?

13:29.975 --> 13:30.975
-Danny.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.049
<i>It's coming.</i>

13:58.771 --> 14:00.505
Get out.

14:02.975 --> 14:04.542
Run.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.536
-Sorry, did I wake you?

14:31.538 --> 14:32.578
-I don't feel right, chlo.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.974
-Hang on. Two secs.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.561
Sorry, that's so creepy.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.096
I thought someone was
at my door.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.600
Danny?

15:23.188 --> 15:25.123
<i>- Danny's phone.
Leave a message.</i>

15:25.125 --> 15:27.959
-Where are you?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.327
Just call me, okay?

15:53.687 --> 15:54.986
Danny?

15:54.988 --> 15:56.187
-<i> Run for your life.</i>

15:56.189 --> 15:57.722
-Danny.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.990
-<i> Chlo..</i>

15:58.992 --> 16:00.325
-Danny.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.598
- Do you mind?
The cleaners wanna do the room.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.934
- Yeah, sorry.
I'll just get my phone.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.875
Someone open the door! Help!

17:23.877 --> 17:26.611
Someone open the door!
Someone open the door!

17:26.613 --> 17:29.981
Open the door! Open the door!

17:29.983 --> 17:31.716
<i>Help!</i>

17:31.718 --> 17:33.985
<i>Help, open the door! Please!</i>

17:35.388 --> 17:36.388
Please!

17:37.022 --> 17:38.456
-What's going on?

18:00.379 --> 18:01.779
-Ben.

18:02.347 --> 18:03.414
-What?

18:04.716 --> 18:05.917
-There's someone here.

18:05.919 --> 18:06.984
-What?

18:18.297 --> 18:19.697
-Wait.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.637
-No, no. Wait there.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.458
-Can I stay?

18:48.594 --> 18:50.394
-<i> Okay. Bye.</i>

18:53.299 --> 18:58.236
So, um, they said
that it's okay for a few nights

18:58.238 --> 19:00.371
but you have to call Louisa
in the morning.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.909
- It's lovely to have you here,
Chloe.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.180
Okay, I'll see you
in the morning.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.059
-Sorry about the mess.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.231
<i>We've been redecorating.</i>

19:36.708 --> 19:39.110
We were really hoping that

19:39.112 --> 19:41.879
you would pick
the paint color for the room

19:42.714 --> 19:46.617
and, uh, you know, just

19:46.619 --> 19:48.886
make the room your own, really.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.122
Yeah.

19:53.358 --> 19:57.261
The bathroom
is through that door.

19:57.263 --> 20:01.098
And, um, Ben and i
are just across the hall

20:01.100 --> 20:04.235
if you, if you need anything.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.274
-This place is huge.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.716
Did you win the lottery
or something?

20:12.912 --> 20:15.413
-Um, no.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.316
Although sometimes
it does feel like it.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.085
<i>The last few years
have been amazing.</i>

20:24.223 --> 20:26.958
The only thing missing was you,
Chloe.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.759
- Well, I'm not gonna
stay very long.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.127
Couple of nights maybe.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.301
- Listen, about
what you said before.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.172
I know that I can't change
what I did.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.573
-I'm pretty tired.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.244
-Of course.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.013
Um..

20:50.849 --> 20:52.350
See you in the morning.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.787
-Can you leave it open?

20:58.557 --> 20:59.824
Please.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.693
-Yeah.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.197
I'm really glad you're here,
Chloe.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.946
<i>She hates me.</i>

21:24.449 --> 21:27.151
<i>I don't blame her.</i>

21:27.153 --> 21:29.620
<i>- Sweetheart,
you can't change the past.</i>

21:29.622 --> 21:31.022
<i>What matters
is that you're trying</i>

21:31.024 --> 21:32.490
<i>to do the right thing now.</i>

21:34.259 --> 21:35.660
<i>Look, I've got to go.</i>

21:35.662 --> 21:37.022
<i>I'll be back for dinner,
alright?</i>

21:43.835 --> 21:45.036
<i>- Why are we having
this conversation again?</i>

21:45.038 --> 21:46.470
<i>I thought we agreed</i>

21:46.472 --> 21:47.505
<i>there would be no more
work trips for a while.</i>

21:47.507 --> 21:48.906
-I know, I know, I'm sorry.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.675
Look, it's only for a few days.

21:50.677 --> 21:51.842
-Get someone else to go.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.577
-I would if I could.

21:53.579 --> 21:56.647
Some new client has insisted
i attend personally.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.249
-Hey, Chloe.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.595
It's carrot and coriander soup.

22:13.365 --> 22:15.166
-I'll alert the media.

22:18.203 --> 22:19.837
<i>- Do you like it?
It's organic.</i>

22:20.672 --> 22:21.906
-Mm-hmm.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.349
-Thank you.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.786
-So, I was thinking

22:35.788 --> 22:38.055
<i>maybe tomorrow</i>

22:38.057 --> 22:40.758
<i>you could give me a hand
in the studio?</i>

22:40.760 --> 22:42.920
It would be a big help to get
the new collection ready.

22:45.797 --> 22:47.677
<i>- Well, maybe she doesn't want
to be an artist.</i>

22:49.000 --> 22:50.901
<i>Some people have real jobs,
you know.</i>

22:53.004 --> 22:54.772
-What, like being a banker?

22:54.774 --> 22:56.807
-<i> Hah, okay.</i>

22:56.809 --> 23:00.945
<i>You got me there.
We are a bunch of shits.</i>

23:00.947 --> 23:02.507
- You enjoy his money though,
don't you?

23:08.653 --> 23:10.588
- Actually, we, we bought
the house together.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.494
-Did you?

23:16.496 --> 23:18.129
- Just to be clear,
i didn't need her to

23:18.131 --> 23:20.765
I'm bloody loaded,
but your mother is

23:20.767 --> 23:24.001
<i>a very stubborn,
independent woman</i>

23:24.003 --> 23:28.172
<i>and those hideous things she
makes sell for a fortune.</i>

23:41.119 --> 23:42.253
<i>Christ!</i>

23:42.255 --> 23:43.454
Hey.
- What's the matter?

23:54.900 --> 23:57.101
- Hey, let me.
Let me do it.

24:01.473 --> 24:03.274
Maybe she doesn't like
coriander.

24:06.878 --> 24:07.945
I'll be back soon.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.447
-<i> Yeah. Bye.</i>

25:22.287 --> 25:23.687
Chloe?

26:52.077 --> 26:53.611
Who are you?

27:02.954 --> 27:04.788
-<i> Przepraszam.</i>

27:04.790 --> 27:06.824
-No!

27:35.854 --> 27:37.721
Jesus!

27:37.723 --> 27:39.023
-I heard you shouting.

27:41.926 --> 27:43.861
-Um, it was just a dumb dream.

27:43.863 --> 27:44.863
I'm fine.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.398
-What was it?

27:51.102 --> 27:52.603
-Um..

27:55.106 --> 27:57.441
There was this, um

27:57.443 --> 27:59.043
old woman

28:00.512 --> 28:02.546
with red hair

28:02.548 --> 28:06.250
and she was crying

28:06.252 --> 28:09.453
and she had a... a knife and..

28:11.056 --> 28:12.690
She killed herself.

28:26.337 --> 28:29.773
- When I was a kid, there was
this strange, old woman

28:29.775 --> 28:31.208
who lived near the home.

28:32.977 --> 28:36.480
<i>She had this long,
dirty red hair</i>

28:36.482 --> 28:38.549
everyone called her ginger.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.453
<i>And she never came out of
the house, but you'd see her</i>

28:42.455 --> 28:43.887
<i>in the window sometimes..</i>

28:46.224 --> 28:48.759
And people started saying
that she was a witch.

28:52.697 --> 28:55.966
<i>And so after she died,
stories started</i>

28:55.968 --> 28:59.770
<i>that if you went
and knocked on her door</i>

28:59.772 --> 29:02.639
<i>she would come and get you.</i>

29:05.444 --> 29:07.244
Danny and I went there
the other night.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.985
<i>We knocked.</i>

29:16.454 --> 29:18.956
And now Danny's gone

29:18.958 --> 29:20.758
and I think
she's coming for me next.

29:20.760 --> 29:24.628
- Oh, sweetie,
it was just a bad dream.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.531
-Please don't let her get me.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.301
-Okay.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.671
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

29:36.975 --> 29:40.344
You're safe, okay?

30:06.805 --> 30:08.138
Morning.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.508
I think we overslept.

30:19.417 --> 30:20.851
-Sorry.

30:22.587 --> 30:23.921
-Don't be.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.027
Oh.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.245
It's okay.

31:06.164 --> 31:07.264
Tira?

31:08.299 --> 31:10.567
-Am I early?

31:10.569 --> 31:14.037
- Oh. God. Um, you know,
i must have totally forgotten.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.077
Uh, just give me a second.

31:21.412 --> 31:23.280
Alright, let's go.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.819
We're gonna finish
by the time she's walking.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.754
-That soon?

31:33.325 --> 31:35.092
<i>- I thought you might like
some coffee.</i>

31:36.194 --> 31:38.128
-Oh, gosh, would I ever?

31:38.130 --> 31:39.796
Thank you.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.498
<i>Um, sorry, tira,
this is my daugh..</i>

31:41.500 --> 31:44.268
<i>Um, sorry.
Uh, this is Chloe.</i>

31:47.438 --> 31:48.939
-I'm sorry, I have to go.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.443
-Tira?

31:56.148 --> 31:59.349
-I think I have to go.

32:04.722 --> 32:06.256
-Tira?

32:08.726 --> 32:10.294
What's goin' on?

32:12.363 --> 32:14.197
-Nothing. I can't stay.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.465
-Tell me.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.001
- Be careful, Jess.
You can't help her.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.804
She belongs to someone else.

32:21.706 --> 32:25.008
<i>There's a darkness around her.</i>

32:25.010 --> 32:27.878
Trust me, Jess,
i know about these things.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.681
She's marked
by something terrible.

32:30.683 --> 32:32.616
-What do you mean?

33:05.683 --> 33:07.584
<i>- How's your mother
been treating you?</i>

33:07.586 --> 33:09.586
-<i> Okay.</i>

33:09.588 --> 33:10.821
-<i> You look upset.</i>

33:10.823 --> 33:11.989
-<i> I'm fine.</i>

33:11.991 --> 33:14.057
-<i> Are you both getting on okay?</i>

33:14.059 --> 33:16.259
-<i> Yeah.</i>

33:16.261 --> 33:17.894
-Are you okay?

33:20.164 --> 33:21.665
-Chloe?

33:23.034 --> 33:24.868
-This is detective boardman.

33:26.771 --> 33:29.506
- Don't worry,
she's not in any trouble.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.609
Friend of Chloe's, Dan chambers,
he's been reported missing.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.111
I'm just following up.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.679
I was just telling her
there's probably

33:35.681 --> 33:37.047
nothing for her to worry about.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.950
- Right. And, um,
you two know each other?

33:40.818 --> 33:42.953
-Oh, yes, we..

33:42.955 --> 33:44.755
<i>We've known each other
since she was little.</i>

33:49.727 --> 33:51.361
A few years ago we got called
to woodman house

33:51.363 --> 33:53.296
the children's home.

33:53.298 --> 33:56.433
One of their boys,
a ten year old, Michael flowers

33:56.435 --> 33:59.736
he'd been reported missing and..

33:59.738 --> 34:04.041
His mates, Chloe and Danny,
got it into their heads that

34:04.043 --> 34:08.045
this old lady, Mary aminov,
had something to do with it..

34:10.047 --> 34:11.815
And they hounded her.

34:17.021 --> 34:20.223
Kept knocking on her door,
night after night

34:20.225 --> 34:21.558
until in the end..

34:23.761 --> 34:25.041
She couldn't take it any more.

34:26.496 --> 34:27.764
<i>She killed herself.</i>

34:30.501 --> 34:32.668
By the time we found the body,
the foxes had got to it.

34:32.670 --> 34:37.440
It was a nasty business.

34:37.443 --> 34:40.110
-Um, did you ever find out

34:40.112 --> 34:43.246
if she took Chloe's friend,
Michael?

34:43.248 --> 34:45.916
- There wasn't any evidence,
but..

34:45.918 --> 34:49.286
99% of the time
when something bad does happen

34:49.288 --> 34:51.621
to a child,
it's down to someone they know.

34:56.860 --> 35:00.163
- You said you believed us.
- And I investigated.

35:00.165 --> 35:01.698
Thoroughly.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.368
Now, ahem.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.972
When was the last time
that you saw Danny?

35:08.974 --> 35:10.974
-We knocked on ginger's door.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.446
She took him,
and now she's coming for me.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.150
-Chloe..

35:23.488 --> 35:26.223
The one thing that we can be
really certain of

35:26.225 --> 35:29.893
is that old lady aminov
is not back from the dead.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.196
-Chloe.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.001
- Must be very difficult
bringing up a child on your own.

35:39.604 --> 35:42.139
- My husband will be back
in a few days.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.840
-Okay. Stay in touch.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.809
-Will do.

36:40.965 --> 36:43.033
<i>Hey. It's just foxes.</i>

36:43.035 --> 36:45.068
We get them around here.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.403
What are you looking at?

36:49.874 --> 36:52.275
-You need to see this.

36:52.277 --> 36:54.711
Baba yaga,
it's eastern European, I think

36:54.713 --> 36:57.814
but it means different things,
evil hag, dark mother.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.816
She's the most
ancient kind of demon.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.552
<i>She opens a doorway between
hell and the world of men</i>

37:02.554 --> 37:04.721
so that she can devour
the innocent.

37:09.694 --> 37:11.094
Like my friend, Michael.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.432
<i>The demon's powers are limited</i>

37:15.434 --> 37:17.834
so she needs the help
from a human slave

37:17.836 --> 37:21.071
or... or a cursed soul to help
do her bidding here on earth.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.108
<i>And you can tell
who the human slave is</i>

37:25.110 --> 37:26.977
<i>because the demon marks them.</i>

37:28.613 --> 37:29.846
Look.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.317
<i>I bet Mary had that mark.</i>

37:36.087 --> 37:38.588
<i>When you knock, the first
knock raises the demon</i>

37:38.590 --> 37:41.324
<i>the second
summons the human slave</i>

37:41.326 --> 37:42.959
<i>and the only way that
the human slave can be free</i>

37:42.961 --> 37:45.695
<i>of the demon
is if they kill themselves</i>

37:45.697 --> 37:47.430
<i>or if they trick someone else
into replacing them</i>

37:47.432 --> 37:50.133
<i>by forcing them to do
something truly, truly evil.</i>

37:50.135 --> 37:51.668
-Enough.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.805
- I thought
you wanted to help me.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.008
- I do, sweetie,
but this is insane.

39:18.155 --> 39:19.622
What is it?

39:20.491 --> 39:21.858
-Doesn't matter.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.528
-Yes, it does. Come here.

39:26.497 --> 39:28.431
Come here.

39:28.433 --> 39:29.733
Okay.

39:31.469 --> 39:32.602
Um..

39:34.138 --> 39:36.206
We are gonna work
with some Clay.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.707
Here.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.142
Warm it up in your hands.

39:40.344 --> 39:42.812
We're just gonna put it around.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.549
Like this.
Doesn't have to be pretty.

39:47.518 --> 39:50.387
Cover the whole thing.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.122
Fingers too.

39:52.690 --> 39:54.958
See? Fun.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.476
- Do you remember when you
and your friends had that party

40:13.478 --> 40:17.447
and you painted all those crazy
animals on my wall?

40:19.950 --> 40:21.518
-Um..

40:24.255 --> 40:27.957
Yeah, yeah, I do.

40:30.928 --> 40:34.531
You must have been, like five?

40:34.533 --> 40:35.965
Maybe?

40:40.237 --> 40:42.138
- There was that turtle
above my bed

40:42.140 --> 40:44.007
the big green one
looking down on me

40:44.009 --> 40:45.275
I loved that thing.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.446
-That's right.

40:54.718 --> 40:57.020
- That horrible bear
you painted behind the door.

40:58.656 --> 41:00.356
It used to scare me so much.

41:04.061 --> 41:08.465
- I... I don't remember
doing that.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.501
- Probably 'cause you were high.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.740
You were though, weren't you?

41:26.984 --> 41:30.420
-I was, I was sick.

41:31.856 --> 41:35.492
<i>I hate that word, but, uh,
but it's the truth.</i>

41:36.861 --> 41:38.528
And..

41:41.499 --> 41:43.433
When it got..

41:45.035 --> 41:47.103
Really bad, I just..

41:48.772 --> 41:51.274
I figured that
you were safer with..

41:52.843 --> 41:54.163
Someone else lookin' after you.

41:56.213 --> 41:57.680
-Well, I wasn't.

42:04.154 --> 42:06.623
Forget it.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.592
- I tried to get you back
sooner, I... I really did.

42:09.594 --> 42:11.461
They just,
they... they wouldn't let me.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.601
Maybe they were right,
maybe I... I wasn't

42:18.603 --> 42:21.104
I wasn't ready back then, but..

42:25.809 --> 42:27.043
I'm ready now.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.453
God, I could use a drink.

42:41.859 --> 42:44.794
But we are a, uh..

42:44.796 --> 42:47.964
Soft drink only family now, so..

42:52.236 --> 42:54.938
Uh, we've got diet and regular

42:54.940 --> 42:57.440
I'm sure juice, soda water

42:57.442 --> 43:00.310
um, and let's see.

43:01.045 --> 43:03.413
Uh, regular good?

43:07.785 --> 43:10.520
You really shouldn't move them
like that.

43:10.522 --> 43:12.155
They're so fragile.

43:17.628 --> 43:20.430
I'm sorry.
I am not angry at you.

43:22.032 --> 43:24.033
-I thought I was safe here.

43:26.371 --> 43:28.004
-You are.

43:32.576 --> 43:34.143
Chloe!

43:41.552 --> 43:44.153
<i>- Thanks for the tour.
It's an incredible house.</i>

43:44.155 --> 43:45.855
-Thank you.

43:45.857 --> 43:47.223
Do you mind if I check on Chloe?

43:47.225 --> 43:49.158
We had a big delivery
for the studio.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.393
-No, no problem.

44:11.849 --> 44:13.049
<i>Hello, Chloe.</i>

44:13.051 --> 44:14.717
-Hi.

44:14.719 --> 44:15.885
There's just one more box.

44:15.887 --> 44:16.887
-Okay.

44:18.288 --> 44:20.189
-She's been really helpful.

44:20.191 --> 44:21.924
Okay. The studio's this way.

44:35.305 --> 44:37.940
- Jesus.
- No.

44:37.942 --> 44:38.942
What?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.050
Did you do this?

44:48.385 --> 44:50.219
-No.

44:50.221 --> 44:52.422
-What is wrong with you?

45:10.507 --> 45:11.607
<i>- You know, I'm gonna
have to put that</i>

45:11.609 --> 45:13.142
<i>in my assessment, don't you?</i>

45:14.545 --> 45:16.713
<i>If you feel unable to cope</i>

45:16.715 --> 45:18.715
<i>Chloe can always
come back to us.</i>

45:19.883 --> 45:21.284
<i>You've got my number.</i>

45:23.053 --> 45:24.587
Okay?

45:57.121 --> 45:59.455
<i>- Hello, woodman house
child services?</i>

46:01.659 --> 46:03.993
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

46:06.730 --> 46:10.700
<i>Listen, whoever this is,
I can hear that you're upset.</i>

46:10.702 --> 46:12.535
<i>Just know that you can
speak to me in confidence</i>

46:12.537 --> 46:14.036
<i>and I'll do my best to help you.</i>

46:16.073 --> 46:18.274
<i>Are you still there?</i>

46:18.276 --> 46:19.942
<i>Hello?</i>

46:41.165 --> 46:42.665
-<i> Chloe?</i>

46:47.271 --> 46:48.971
What are you doing?

46:48.973 --> 46:50.473
-Leaving.

46:53.410 --> 46:55.878
-Why?

46:55.880 --> 46:57.720
- 'Cause you're gonna
send me back, aren't you?

47:02.252 --> 47:04.921
Dump me?
Isn't that what you do?

47:11.628 --> 47:15.398
- Do you know the scariest part
about having a baby?

47:18.869 --> 47:23.172
<i>It's not the pain
or the sleepless nights</i>

47:23.174 --> 47:25.341
it's not even doing it alone..

47:30.981 --> 47:32.615
It's the love.

47:36.386 --> 47:37.787
<i>Nobody prepares you for that.</i>

47:40.490 --> 47:42.692
It's like, uh..

47:42.694 --> 47:48.364
This wave that crashes into
you and pulls you out

47:48.366 --> 47:51.267
to sea, you can't..

47:51.269 --> 47:52.702
You can't fight it.

47:54.738 --> 47:56.239
It's too strong.

48:07.985 --> 48:11.554
I loved you from
the moment I saw you.

48:16.326 --> 48:18.895
I loved you
when you were crying.

48:20.030 --> 48:22.665
I loved you when I was high.

48:24.501 --> 48:26.002
I loved you when I..

48:31.041 --> 48:33.075
I loved you when I gave you up.

48:41.018 --> 48:42.418
I loved you when I was..

48:44.354 --> 48:45.955
Thousands of miles away.

48:50.193 --> 48:51.794
<i>And I love you now.</i>

48:53.697 --> 48:55.665
<i>No matter what happens..</i>

48:57.601 --> 48:59.502
Nothing will ever change that.

49:03.140 --> 49:04.774
-It wasn't me.

49:12.249 --> 49:13.816
-Okay.

51:45.936 --> 51:47.203
-Jess?

51:49.072 --> 51:51.040
Jess?

52:58.508 --> 53:00.176
Jess?

53:05.982 --> 53:08.083
Jess?

53:21.398 --> 53:23.199
Jess?

53:25.368 --> 53:27.102
-<i> Run.</i>

54:02.339 --> 54:03.906
-Jess?

54:07.344 --> 54:09.345
Jess?

54:26.730 --> 54:28.697
-Run!

55:32.996 --> 55:34.897
-Jess, please!

55:34.899 --> 55:37.599
Jess! Help. Help!

55:41.104 --> 55:42.705
Don't, she's in there!

56:12.736 --> 56:14.436
- Chloe,
there's no one in there.

56:17.874 --> 56:20.743
Sweetheart, there's no one
in there. Okay?

56:21.745 --> 56:22.778
Okay.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.248
Shh.

56:39.496 --> 56:40.829
Okay.

56:41.931 --> 56:43.966
I've got you. Shh.

56:48.738 --> 56:49.972
Hey.

56:52.675 --> 56:54.576
I got an idea, alright?

56:56.946 --> 56:59.515
I might need your help.

57:11.795 --> 57:13.128
Okay.

58:05.482 --> 58:06.682
-Did you grab my passport?

58:06.684 --> 58:07.983
-Yes.

58:10.353 --> 58:12.113
- Uh, we're gonna be
super early, though, so.

58:28.805 --> 58:30.405
-Jess.

58:36.846 --> 58:38.013
Help!

58:41.384 --> 58:43.352
-Chloe, Chloe!

58:44.988 --> 58:47.089
Come on, no!

58:47.091 --> 58:48.290
-Jess?

58:48.292 --> 58:49.458
Jess, please!

58:49.460 --> 58:50.759
- Chloe, no!
- Help!

59:06.576 --> 59:09.378
God, no!

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.833
<i>- You finally covered up
dad's initials.</i>

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:13.141
Good choice.

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.182
What are we gonna do?

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.953
- We're gonna find someone
who can help.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.190
Okay?

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.693
Okay.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.841
<i>- I'm so sorry, Jess,
I want to help.</i>

01:00:45.843 --> 01:00:47.909
I have my own daughter
to think about.

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:50.045
- Just tell us what
we're dealing with, that's all.

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:52.207
You said that Chloe belongs
to someone else, what did..

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:57.152
Did you mean this?

01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:00.656
-No. This is not right.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:03.659
Don't believe everything
you read on the Internet.

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:05.927
It's not a baba yaga
haunting you.

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:07.663
-Then what is it?

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:10.899
- Mary was accused of a
terrible crime she didn't commit

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:13.268
and driven to suicide.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:16.038
Chloe helped spread that lie

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.839
and now Mary wants revenge.

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:25.380
Jess, so far your love
for Chloe has protected her.

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:33.121
-It's my fault.

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:37.125
-No, it's not. Don't say that.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.300
-Hi.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:47.369
-Hey! Stay away from her!

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:48.637
I don't want you near my baby.

01:01:48.639 --> 01:01:50.639
-Okay. Okay.

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:54.743
Tira, how do I stop this?

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:57.646
<i>- Jess, there is only one way
to save your daughter.</i>

01:01:57.648 --> 01:02:00.315
- How?
- By clearing Mary's name.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:04.453
If she didn't take that boy,
then find out who did.

01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:08.323
And if you listen hard enough,
perhaps she will guide you.

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:13.995
-What do you think?

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.734
<i>Chloe?</i>

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.570
<i>Chloe!</i>

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.679
That missing boy Michael..

01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:32.681
Were there ever any other
suspects besides Mary?

01:02:32.683 --> 01:02:36.818
- Not as I recall.
Chances are he just ran away.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.120
- But Chloe said that
you believed her

01:02:38.122 --> 01:02:39.788
about Mary taking Michael,
what changed your mind?

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.424
<i>- I didn't say
I changed my mind.</i>

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:43.859
We closed the case, that's all.

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:47.996
Jess.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.387
<i>- And if you listen hard enough</i>

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:13.655
<i>perhaps she will guide you.</i>

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:55.924
- "Michael flowers."

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:26.955
<i>- That Michael flowers,
he's not the first, is he?</i>

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:30.492
<i>What about her?
Or her? Or him?</i>

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:31.927
Tell me!

01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:38.667
<i>What do you think
will happen to you</i>

01:05:38.669 --> 01:05:41.469
<i>when people find out
what you did?</i>

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:46.675
I will make sure
that everybody does.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.844
- We're here to discuss
what happens next.

01:06:22.846 --> 01:06:25.580
-What do you mean?

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:28.383
<i>- Chloe was very upset
when detective boardman</i>

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:30.819
<i>returned her to us this morning.</i>

01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:33.054
<i>He's raised
some serious concerns</i>

01:06:33.056 --> 01:06:35.056
<i>about your relationship
with her.</i>

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:36.825
-Just trying to protect her.

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:40.762
She needs me.

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:43.431
<i>- She spent last night
alone on the streets.</i>

01:06:43.433 --> 01:06:45.700
<i>She believes that
witches are conspiring</i>

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:47.669
<i>to feed her to a demon.</i>

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.204
<i>How exactly is exposing her</i>

01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:51.006
<i>to this kind of nonsense
protecting her?</i>

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:54.009
- Have you asked Chloe
what she wants?

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:58.713
-Jess, are you using again?

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:05.954
- No. -Then would it be alright
with you to provide a sample?

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:13.795
-Sure. You got a cup?

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:16.297
- You're showing
some aggression.

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:18.033
-Oh, you have no idea.

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:21.603
No fucking idea.

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:26.374
I am just trying to protect her,
okay?

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.944
She's my daughter. She's mine.

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.815
Goddamnit!

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.388
- There will have to be
a full review

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.424
<i>but it's only fair to warn you</i>

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:44.459
<i>that in light of what's happened</i>

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:48.063
<i>it is very likely your contact
with Chloe will be restricted.</i>

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:51.099
<i>She's a traumatized,
vulnerable young woman</i>

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:54.669
<i>who needs a stable environment.</i>

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:56.504
<i>Perhaps you should
consider counseling</i>

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:58.640
<i>for your own issues before
reapplying for custody.</i>

01:07:58.642 --> 01:07:59.774
-<i> Michael flowers.</i>

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:02.110
-<i> Sorry?</i>

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:04.913
- Is this detective boardman?
- <i>What?</i>

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.414
-Is this detective boardman?

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:10.151
- Yes. He's volunteered
here for years.

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:11.686
<i>The kids love him.</i>

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:16.524
-<i> But 99% of the time</i>

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:18.626
<i>when something bad
does happen to a child.</i>

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:21.296
-<i> Jess, we're not finished.</i>

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:22.618
<i>- It's down to someone
they know.</i>

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:41.515
-Chloe. Come on.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.822
Shit.
- This way.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.336
- Jess, I don't think
i can help her.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.371
- Please, tira,
we don't have anyone else.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:05.573
<i>- Okay. I'll see
what I can do.</i>

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:07.908
- Okay.
- Meet me back in the park.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:09.042
I don't live far from there.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:21.923
Thanks for coming back for me.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.165
-Chloe!

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:36.069
Chloe! Chloe!

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.283
Shit.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.229
Chloe?

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:43.998
Chloe, is that you?

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:48.736
<i>- Yeah, I've got her,
she's down here.</i>

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:50.305
- No, I need more time.
I need more time.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:52.140
You didn't give me enough time.
I can bring you what you need.

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:53.574
I just need more time.
- <i>You are trespassing.</i>

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:55.176
- Come with us.
- I don't know what to do!

01:11:55.178 --> 01:11:56.344
-<i> Come outside. Don't resist.</i>

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.249
-Wait. Ow, ow, ow, wait.

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:04.919
<i>- Just stay with her.
I'll be back.</i>

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.913
- You're expecting someone else?

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:22.997
This little reformed character
act you've got going

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:25.767
it's paper thin, isn't it?

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.338
Scratch the surface
and you're still

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.775
the same selfish piece of shit
that abandoned your kid

01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:36.010
as soon as she got
in the way of your career.

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:40.481
-You don't know me.

01:13:40.483 --> 01:13:43.818
-No. You don't understand.

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:51.025
You fucked up that poor
little girl's life once.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:56.664
And I am not gonna let you
fuck it up again.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:59.267
Now, where did you take Chloe?

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:03.371
What did you do with her?

01:14:03.373 --> 01:14:04.839
Where is she?

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:11.212
- She took her.
- Who?

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.218
-Mary aminov.

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:22.123
Ginger.
- What?

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.625
<i>- I thought I could protect her.</i>

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.128
But once you knock,
she doesn't stop.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.296
She just keeps coming.

01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:30.865
-Oh, enough!

01:14:30.867 --> 01:14:33.134
Tell me the truth.

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:40.074
-You didn't tell me the truth.

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:43.878
You said that the kids
hounded that woman.

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:47.849
But it was you.

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:50.751
You blamed her for the killings.

01:14:50.753 --> 01:14:54.188
You kept at her until
she couldn't take it any more.

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:59.193
-She killed herself.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:04.999
She got what she deserved.

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:10.905
-Did she? Did she really?

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:17.011
It's usually down
to someone they know.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:20.781
That's what you told me.
- So?

01:15:20.783 --> 01:15:24.619
- So, you knew them
better than she did.

01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:27.788
You knew Michael,
you knew all the kids.

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:33.361
Why were you so determined
to point the finger at Mary?

01:15:33.363 --> 01:15:36.297
<i>Was she an easy scapegoat?</i>

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:38.733
<i>Why were there
never any other suspects?</i>

01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:41.602
How did it happen?

01:15:41.604 --> 01:15:44.472
How does something
like that happen?

01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:47.942
<i>Did you see him out
on the street that night?</i>

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:50.044
<i>Did you offer
to give him a ride home?</i>

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.814
How many others have you taken?

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.136
-We'll talk again later.

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.575
-Come on.

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:13.554
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:18.626
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:33.828
Chloe? Chloe.

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.667
-<i> Jess.</i>

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:42.102
<i>Jess.</i>

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.442
<i>This way.</i>

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:00.821
Chloe?

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:04.358
Hello?

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:15.603
Wait. Wait!

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.973
Wait.

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:35.923
Hello?

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:48.903
Chloe?

01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:50.104
Ah!

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.728
-<i> Michael.</i>

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:55.502
-<i> Help! Help!</i>

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:58.706
<i>Get away!</i>

01:22:58.708 --> 01:23:00.541
<i>No!</i>

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.367
-Jess!

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:04.571
- Hi. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:18.819
-It's coming.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:24.825
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:27.788
-<i> Help!</i>

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:33.293
<i>Help us!</i>

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.246
Come on!

01:26:07.263 --> 01:26:08.896
Run.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.068
-<i> No!</i>

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:19.339
Come on!

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:22.843
-<i> Wait!</i>

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:31.218
Help me. Help me.

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:51.638
- Come on.
Come on, we gotta go. Come on.

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.324
-What the fuck?

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:14.962
Jess?

01:27:14.964 --> 01:27:16.463
Jess!

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:29.509
What are you doing?

01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:31.111
Where's Jess?

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:34.014
<i>I'm calling the police.</i>

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:03.010
-Ben?

01:28:37.413 --> 01:28:41.682
So, Chloe and I are home.

01:28:41.684 --> 01:28:47.087
Um, we're safe. So, come back.

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:50.157
Okay. Bye. Love you.

01:28:57.832 --> 01:29:00.200
You okay?

01:29:00.202 --> 01:29:01.601
-Just thinking about boardman.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.205
-He did some very bad things.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:10.110
He had it coming.

01:29:10.112 --> 01:29:12.079
- What do you mean?
What did he do?

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:16.683
-Your friend, Michael boardman

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.585
is the one who really took him.

01:29:18.587 --> 01:29:20.220
<i>He made everyone think
that it was Mary</i>

01:29:20.222 --> 01:29:22.789
<i>so they wouldn't suspect him.</i>

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:25.258
He got what he deserved.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.427
-Boardman didn't take Michael.

01:29:27.429 --> 01:29:30.197
He was a good man.
He always protected us.

01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:32.632
- How are you?
You being taken care of?

01:29:32.634 --> 01:29:34.935
<i>- He's volunteered
here for years.</i>

01:29:34.937 --> 01:29:36.737
<i>The kids love him.</i>

01:29:36.739 --> 01:29:37.904
-What are you talking about?

01:29:37.906 --> 01:29:40.107
-I saw Michael.

01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:42.609
<i>Mary fed him to the demon.</i>

01:29:42.611 --> 01:29:45.545
<i>Boardman was the only one
who believed us.</i>

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:48.148
- And I investigated.
Thoroughly.

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:55.756
Everybody knows what you did.

01:29:57.358 --> 01:29:58.658
<i>She killed herself.</i>

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:00.293
-No!

01:30:00.295 --> 01:30:02.963
-<i> She got what she deserved.</i>

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:11.505
<i>- And the only way
that the human slave</i>

01:30:11.507 --> 01:30:14.341
can be free of the demon
is if they kill themselves.

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.578
Or if they trick someone else
into replacing them

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.848
by forcing them to do something
truly, truly evil.

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:24.351
-<i> Mary was the demon's slave.</i>

01:30:24.353 --> 01:30:26.853
<i>She killed herself to be free.</i>

01:30:26.855 --> 01:30:28.855
<i>Tira lied to me.</i>

01:30:28.857 --> 01:30:30.757
- It's not a baba yaga
haunting you.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:33.593
-She tricked me.

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:37.364
- If she didn't take that boy,
then find out who did.

01:30:37.366 --> 01:30:39.246
<i>- She made me believe that
boardman was guilty.</i>

01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:54.214
Shit!
