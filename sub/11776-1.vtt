00:02.367 --> 00:04.167
[narrator] Humans have been
getting inked

00:04.233 --> 00:06.567
for over 5,000 years.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.567
What started as crude etchings

00:08.633 --> 00:10.800
has evolved
into a precision art form.

00:13.767 --> 00:15.400
Welcome to New York City.

00:15.467 --> 00:18.367
[narrator] Now, ten of the best
tattoo artists on the planet

00:18.433 --> 00:20.900
will compete to determine
who is number one.

00:21.667 --> 00:22.700
[groans]

00:22.767 --> 00:24.167
[narrator]
Tattooing human canvasses

00:24.233 --> 00:26.067
in a series
of extreme challenges.

00:26.133 --> 00:27.167
[bleep]

00:27.233 --> 00:28.200
[narrator] Their skills
will be tested

00:28.267 --> 00:30.067
in every essential discipline.

00:31.133 --> 00:32.700
Their masterpieces

00:32.767 --> 00:35.533
and mistakes will last forever.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.933
[Chris] This is not the design
that the client asked for.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.867
It's a bad-looking design.

00:39.933 --> 00:41.900
[narrator] Judged by top names
in the industry.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.900
You're competing for 100 grand

00:43.967 --> 00:46.400
and you're gonna do something
that's on somebody forever.

00:46.467 --> 00:47.733
[narrator] They'll be eliminated

00:47.800 --> 00:50.633
until only the best
tattoo artist remains,

00:51.500 --> 00:53.700
earning a $100,000 prize

00:54.800 --> 00:55.567
and the title...

00:56.933 --> 00:58.200
of Ink Master.

01:03.633 --> 01:05.533
[theme music playing]

01:46.167 --> 01:48.167
There's a lot on the line.
100,000 bucks.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.533
-What's up?
-Hello, hello.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.933
[Bili] There are a ton
of great artists here,

01:51.000 --> 01:52.267
and it's gonna be
a fight to the end.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.000
I wanna win the $100,000,

01:55.067 --> 01:56.200
and I wanna prove the world

01:56.267 --> 01:58.367
that it doesn't matter
if I'm a girl,

01:58.433 --> 01:59.867
I'm as good as all those guys
out there.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.833
I'm gonna win this.
Because I want the money!

02:07.133 --> 02:08.100
I'm here to do one thing,

02:08.167 --> 02:10.199
become the Ink Master,
win $100,000.

02:11.567 --> 02:12.833
I didn't come here
to make friends.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.200
I didn't come here
to make buddies.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.233
You're my competition,
and I'll destroy you.

02:17.433 --> 02:19.067
My strategy
to win this competition

02:19.133 --> 02:20.767
is to have fun
with each tattoo I do,

02:20.833 --> 02:22.367
have fun with each client
I work with,

02:22.433 --> 02:23.567
and get to the finale,

02:23.867 --> 02:25.467
and then slice the throat
of the person

02:25.533 --> 02:26.733
who's ahead of me,
and I win.

02:29.833 --> 02:30.667
Hey. What's up, guys?

02:31.267 --> 02:33.300
[applause]

02:33.367 --> 02:35.133
Welcome to New York City.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.933
[Jeremy] All of a sudden,
Dave Navarro walks out.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.233
He's a rock star, you know?

02:38.300 --> 02:40.133
This is shocking. This is
a little bit intimidating.

02:41.067 --> 02:43.033
We're here in New York City's
Meatpacking District.

02:44.233 --> 02:45.733
[Dave] Just a few blocks
from this very spot,

02:45.800 --> 02:47.433
Irish immigrant,
Samuel O' Reilly,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.800
opened the very first
tattoo parlor in America

02:49.867 --> 02:51.233
over 150 years ago.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.933
Now, all of you standing here
claim to be the best.

02:54.233 --> 02:55.833
Well, this is your chance
to prove it.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.367
[James] I've been tattooing
20 years.

02:57.433 --> 02:58.800
I'm very confident I can win.

02:58.867 --> 03:00.800
I just want everybody
in the world to know who I am.

03:00.867 --> 03:02.167
I'm James Vaughn.

03:02.233 --> 03:04.100
Over the next eight weeks,
you'll live and work together,

03:04.167 --> 03:06.067
competing in grueling
tattoo sessions

03:06.133 --> 03:07.933
designed to test
the most essential skills

03:08.000 --> 03:10.133
that you must possess
to be a master tattooist.

03:10.767 --> 03:11.733
In the end,

03:11.800 --> 03:14.167
one of you
will earn $100,000 prize,

03:14.233 --> 03:15.567
a feature in Ink Magazine,

03:15.967 --> 03:18.633
and claim the title
of Ink Master.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.033
[applause]

03:21.000 --> 03:22.700
Before we get started,
let's meet the judges

03:22.767 --> 03:24.000
who will be deciding your fate.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.400
First up is a man
who began tattooing

03:26.467 --> 03:28.000
when he was just 19 years old,

03:28.433 --> 03:30.867
the legendary Oliver Peck.

03:30.933 --> 03:32.633
[Dave] Oliver
is one of the most well-known

03:32.700 --> 03:35.167
old school
American traditional artists.

03:35.233 --> 03:36.433
He owns two shops.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.300
Elm Street Tattoo
in Dallas, Texas,

03:38.367 --> 03:40.567
and True Tattoo
in Hollywood, California.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.533
He was in the
Guinness Book of World Records

03:42.600 --> 03:45.100
for inking the most tattoos
in 24-hour period.

03:45.167 --> 03:47.067
I've been tattooing
for 20 years.

03:47.133 --> 03:48.733
And really concentrated
and learned

03:48.800 --> 03:50.667
every kind of style
that I could get a hold of.

03:50.733 --> 03:52.300
If I was a contestant
on the show,

03:52.367 --> 03:53.367
what would matter
the most to me

03:53.633 --> 03:55.300
is just not looking
like a dumbass.

03:55.933 --> 03:58.600
Next up, this guy started out
as a graffiti artist

03:58.667 --> 04:00.667
and then moved
to more permanent canvas...

04:01.200 --> 04:02.433
skin.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.733
And he's been perfecting his art
for almost two decades.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.633
Chris Nunez.

04:06.633 --> 04:07.867
[applause]

04:07.933 --> 04:09.700
-[man] Hey, Chris!
-Hey, Chris!

04:09.767 --> 04:12.400
[Dave] In his 20-year career,
Chris has owned several shops,

04:12.467 --> 04:13.900
but he's best known
for being the owner

04:13.967 --> 04:16.233
of Love Hate Tattoo
in Miami, Florida.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.600
[Chris] Well, the style
I'm known best for

04:17.666 --> 04:19.867
is bright, bold,
mostly color work.

04:19.933 --> 04:22.767
What I critique, I critique
with a hard, stern eye.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.300
And I didn't go
wake them up out of bed

04:24.367 --> 04:25.967
and make them come here,
they came on their own.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.033
So, they have to take it.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.000
And your third judge,

04:29.067 --> 04:29.967
you're looking at him.

04:30.033 --> 04:31.000
[chuckles]

04:31.067 --> 04:32.667
It's [bleep] Dave Navarro.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.033
[Dave] I've been
getting tattooed

04:35.100 --> 04:36.867
longer than any of these people
have been tattooing.

04:36.933 --> 04:39.467
I can speak to these artists
as a client would,

04:39.533 --> 04:41.833
'cause I've been in shops
for quarter of a century.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.933
We'll start
with the Flash Challenge,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.333
which is a short-skills test

04:46.400 --> 04:47.800
where the winner
will gain an advantage

04:47.867 --> 04:49.433
going into
the elimination tattoo.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.833
And you'll want any advantage
that you can get.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.733
We've only been here
a handful of minutes,

04:54.800 --> 04:56.500
and right away
they're throwing us a challenge.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.167
I mean, this is gonna be tough.

04:58.233 --> 05:00.533
This week we're establishing
a baseline of your skills

05:00.600 --> 05:02.500
by testing your raw talent.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.433
It's something
that can't be learned or faked.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.133
You either have raw talent

05:06.200 --> 05:07.133
or you don't.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.467
To test your raw talent
in this challenge,

05:10.533 --> 05:12.400
you must create
a tattoo of a skull.

05:12.933 --> 05:15.067
It's up to you
to use the common skull

05:15.333 --> 05:17.067
to show off
your artistic style.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.267
All tattooers should be able
to draw a skull.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.833
The raw talent aspect
of this would be

05:23.900 --> 05:25.733
who can
make this job stand out?

05:26.133 --> 05:28.400
Who can impress the judges
with their own style

05:28.467 --> 05:29.733
and really hit
it out of the park?

05:31.467 --> 05:33.467
You've got 90 minutes
to complete this tattoo.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.167
So pick up your machines,

05:35.467 --> 05:36.433
grab a coat,

05:36.500 --> 05:37.967
and follow me
to meet your clients.

05:39.467 --> 05:40.533
[Al] It's our
first challenge.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.667
Whatever they tell me to do,
I'm gonna do.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.300
You're here to win $100,000.

05:44.367 --> 05:45.567
Go hard or go home.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.200
Alright, guys,

05:56.667 --> 05:58.067
these are your clients.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.433
Smells like death!

06:10.100 --> 06:11.300
Freezing in here.

06:11.367 --> 06:13.167
[Al] I don't eat pork.
I don't wanna smell it,

06:13.233 --> 06:14.433
let alone tattooing it.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
But I signed up for this.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.400
I put my gloves on,
and I'ma get to work.

06:20.367 --> 06:22.733
You got 90 minutes here
to do your tattoos.

06:23.233 --> 06:24.833
And the clock starts
right now.

06:33.633 --> 06:34.900
[Jeremy] A lot of people
in their apprenticeships

06:34.967 --> 06:36.767
use pigs to learn how to tattoo.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.600
It gives an artist a chance

06:38.667 --> 06:42.300
to really, kind of, learn
how to pull a line on skin.

06:42.367 --> 06:45.167
And my tattoo style
is called new school.

06:45.233 --> 06:48.333
It's really cartoony,
kind of based on graffiti.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.567
Most of the stuff that I do
is actually just for fun.

06:50.633 --> 06:52.433
Get a fun tattoo
because it's cool.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.467
[B-Tat] If I could
take this chance

06:58.533 --> 06:59.833
to get an advantage
over these guys...

06:59.900 --> 07:02.033
Like, I gotta get the advantage.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.100
I drive a truck full-time,

07:04.167 --> 07:06.133
and I tattoo full-time also.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.333
I'm taking care of my family,

07:07.400 --> 07:09.167
still pursuing my passion in art

07:09.533 --> 07:11.367
by putting permanent ink
on people's skin.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.933
[Lea] Oh, my God,
we have an hour and a half.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.867
This is a pig,
it's not human flesh,

07:16.933 --> 07:17.900
it's completely different.

07:17.967 --> 07:20.233
So this is not good,
not good at all!

07:21.033 --> 07:22.633
What's your plan?
You going all black and gray?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
[Lea] Yeah.

07:24.067 --> 07:26.367
[Lea] I am
originally from France.

07:26.433 --> 07:28.933
My favorite style
to tattoo is black and gray,

07:29.000 --> 07:30.800
but I also love to do colors.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.233
First time
on the pig skin?

07:33.300 --> 07:34.867
First time.

07:34.933 --> 07:36.167
[Al] The time
is not a issue.

07:36.233 --> 07:38.633
It's the fact that it's a pig.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.200
I have never tattooed on this
kind of surface before,

07:41.267 --> 07:42.867
but give me some ink
and a machine,

07:43.300 --> 07:44.600
and it's gonna get tattooed.

07:44.667 --> 07:47.100
My style is more black and gray,
more street art.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.567
More telling the story
of the inner cities.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.900
It's like graffiti,
but on the skin.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.133
It never is.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.833
[Heather] My favorite style
of tattooing

08:03.900 --> 08:06.067
is more like an oil paintings.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.633
You know, and a lot of
line work, lots of color.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.700
It's pretty challenging

08:09.767 --> 08:11.400
to be a female

08:11.467 --> 08:13.600
in a male-dominated industry.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.900
So, I think it would be great

08:15.967 --> 08:18.833
as a female artist
to win the $100,000.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.067
Time to...

08:20.133 --> 08:21.567
cowgirl up, I guess.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.333
-Great.
-[laughs]

08:23.400 --> 08:24.567
[Dave] These are real artists.

08:24.633 --> 08:25.933
We have museums

08:26.000 --> 08:28.133
that people go
and look at the works of art

08:28.200 --> 08:29.733
that great artists have done.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.433
The general public
doesn't realize

08:31.500 --> 08:34.200
that a guy on the subway
is walking around

08:34.267 --> 08:36.167
with just as impressive
works of art

08:36.232 --> 08:37.100
on his body,

08:37.167 --> 08:38.232
that in many ways

08:38.299 --> 08:40.000
are much more difficult
to pull off.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.600
Work that pig. Mm-hmm.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.100
I work that pig
like nobody's business.

08:47.633 --> 08:48.433
Ooh-ooh!

08:48.967 --> 08:50.200
[Chris] How're you doing
over here, partner?

08:50.567 --> 08:52.167
I'm doing awesome.
How about yourself there?

08:52.667 --> 08:54.333
[Chris] Look at you.
How're you liking it?

08:55.100 --> 08:56.267
[James] I love it.

08:56.333 --> 08:59.200
'Cause I got a thumb
in a pig's ass all day long.

08:59.267 --> 09:01.867
[James] I do big,
traditional Japanese.

09:01.933 --> 09:03.800
Big, bold, and colorful,
that's what I love to do.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.300
Ha-ha!

09:07.033 --> 09:08.400
Whoo. [chuckles]

09:11.133 --> 09:12.267
[Dave] Forty-five minutes, guys.

09:16.367 --> 09:17.567
[Oliver] How's your client
feeling here?

09:17.633 --> 09:19.267
I've never tattooed
this skin before,

09:19.333 --> 09:21.167
and I'm amazed how easy
it takes the ink.

09:21.533 --> 09:23.833
I've been tattooing
14-plus years.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.200
Mostly known for doing

09:25.267 --> 09:27.400
black and gray portrait stuff,
realistic tattoos,

09:27.467 --> 09:29.233
but I can do
any style of tattooing.

09:31.233 --> 09:32.367
[Chris] Do you have
a rhyme or reason

09:32.433 --> 09:33.467
for putting it on the ass?

09:33.533 --> 09:34.833
It was
a tight piece of skin.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.433
Plus, being a little higher,

09:36.700 --> 09:37.967
I have less sway.

09:38.033 --> 09:39.633
[Bili] I specialize in realism.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.233
I always have something
to say about everything,

09:41.300 --> 09:42.567
but I think

09:42.633 --> 09:44.200
it's just 'cause I'm very
opinionated and passionate.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.233
My plan is to do something
a little more quirky,

09:47.300 --> 09:48.500
and not something so serious.

09:48.567 --> 09:50.000
And I wanna do something
that's a little more related

09:50.067 --> 09:51.567
to the pig and funny.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.800
So I put pig ears on the skull
and a pig nose.

09:53.867 --> 09:55.567
I don't necessarily
have a style.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.600
My style is anything
anybody wants.

10:02.833 --> 10:03.667
[Oliver chuckles]

10:05.800 --> 10:07.233
[Josh] I have
a very unique style,

10:07.300 --> 10:08.900
mixing with color, realism,

10:08.967 --> 10:10.700
big, bold, saturated tattoos.

10:12.067 --> 10:13.233
I have a feeling

10:13.300 --> 10:15.233
that other people
aren't gonna do a lot of color,

10:15.300 --> 10:16.800
so I'm gonna
try to blow 'em away

10:16.867 --> 10:18.200
with bright and bold colors.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.333
It's [bleep] freezing
in here, man.

10:28.067 --> 10:29.267
I can't feel my fingers.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.100
My hands are so cold.

10:31.533 --> 10:33.167
And I'm shaking so much

10:33.233 --> 10:36.133
that I can't really do
what I would normally do.

10:37.233 --> 10:39.067
Frostbite is serious business.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.867
I'm not really willing
to lose my fingers for this.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.233
I think Heather needs
to toughen up a little bit.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.700
It's not that cold in here.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.733
I think she just needs
to suck it up and get it done.

10:53.667 --> 10:54.833
[Dave] Alright, getting down
to the wire.

10:55.367 --> 10:57.100
-One minute left.
-[man] Nice.

11:03.533 --> 11:04.667
And that is time.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.300
Machines down.

11:09.467 --> 11:10.767
After seeing everybody's work,

11:10.833 --> 11:12.067
there's a couple
of people that...

11:12.133 --> 11:13.367
that I'm gonna keep my eye on.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.267
But the girls,

11:15.333 --> 11:17.333
I don't see them
hanging in here that long.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.567
From the looks of their pigs,

11:18.867 --> 11:20.333
one of them little piggy
is goin' home.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.100
[Jeremy] It sucks
that I got stuck

11:25.167 --> 11:26.700
with this girl
for my first client.

11:26.767 --> 11:27.833
[woman screaming]

11:27.900 --> 11:29.167
[Al] Whatever he's doing,
it's wrong.

11:29.233 --> 11:30.600
-[screaming]
-Nobody should be screaming.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.200
[bleep] [bleep]
[bleep] [bleep] [bleep]

11:38.200 --> 11:40.367
And that is time.
Machines down.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.367
Get ready for the judges
to come around

11:42.433 --> 11:43.500
to critique your work.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.567
-[Dave] Shane.
-How'd this go for you?

11:47.933 --> 11:49.733
I would have...
I envisioned it lighter,

11:49.800 --> 11:51.667
but even the lightest tones
goin' here

11:51.733 --> 11:53.033
just go dark right away.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.433
Your outline came in
pretty sharp though.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.333
[Shane] Thanks, man.

11:57.433 --> 11:58.400
[Dave] Heather.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.233
Clearly, color was the way
to go.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.433
I made the wrong choice.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.200
I couldn't get past
the cold,

12:04.267 --> 12:05.100
that's for sure.

12:05.533 --> 12:06.900
Day one, it's always rough.

12:08.733 --> 12:09.533
[Dave] Josh.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.800
I actually really like
the use of color on this.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.833
It's definitely solid.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.967
-Black shading.
-[Oliver] Yeah.

12:18.700 --> 12:19.500
[Dave] James.

12:20.033 --> 12:21.300
Good use of space
on this one.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.600
[Dave] And as far as...
It's just shading, no outline,

12:23.667 --> 12:24.767
is that right?
That's [bleep] cool.

12:25.367 --> 12:26.933
[Oliver] Slight hints of color
to bring it out.

12:28.067 --> 12:28.967
[Dave] Tommy.

12:29.033 --> 12:29.967
Spur of the moment...

12:30.267 --> 12:31.367
-idea?
-[Tommy] Spur of the moment.

12:31.433 --> 12:32.267
Yep.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.233
I gotta tell you, man,
that was all improv, man.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.333
I've never tattooed
on a pig's skin.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.400
That's [bleep] weird.

12:38.567 --> 12:39.367
[Dave] Jeremy.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.500
-So you went full color.
-Oh, yeah.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.900
[Oliver] Pretty good depth
in the shading.

12:44.967 --> 12:46.300
I went into this
thinking that

12:46.367 --> 12:47.800
I was gonna blow
everybody else away,

12:48.200 --> 12:50.400
but seeing
everybody else's pig tattoos,

12:50.467 --> 12:51.633
it shows me that
this is gonna be

12:51.700 --> 12:52.800
a fight to the finish.

12:52.867 --> 12:55.067
And everybody's bringing
the top-quality work.

12:55.867 --> 12:56.567
[Oliver] Alright, Lea.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.767
Composition-wise,
it really came through

12:58.833 --> 13:00.000
a lot better in the end.

13:00.067 --> 13:01.733
Like, you really added
all the finishing touches

13:01.800 --> 13:02.700
on it and brought it together.

13:03.867 --> 13:04.733
B-Tat.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.000
[Oliver] So you went pretty big
on this one.

13:07.367 --> 13:08.167
[B-Tat] Yeah.

13:08.933 --> 13:10.400
I really didn't get
a good outline on it.

13:10.967 --> 13:12.133
I don't do too many skulls.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.333
[Dave] Al Fliction.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.867
It's definitely unique.

13:17.933 --> 13:18.900
So you definitely injected

13:18.967 --> 13:20.467
a little bit of yourself
in this one.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.200
[laughter]

13:22.667 --> 13:23.633
[Dave] Alright, Bili.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.633
I got to say, the no outline
worked in this situation.

13:27.433 --> 13:28.167
It's graphic as hell.

13:30.067 --> 13:31.800
[Shane]
Bili's skull, it's small.

13:31.867 --> 13:32.967
There's no detail.

13:33.033 --> 13:34.167
It's kind of like a sticker.

13:34.233 --> 13:35.467
He just took the easy way out

13:35.533 --> 13:38.333
and just packed some color
into a small-ass skull.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.067
[Josh] Bili Vegas
and Shane O'Neill

13:40.133 --> 13:41.233
are definitely a threat to me.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.667
Very talented,
all-around artists.

13:43.733 --> 13:44.833
I know right away,

13:44.900 --> 13:46.067
I need to get rid
of those guys.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.033
Well, I definitely have

13:49.700 --> 13:51.000
the top two
or three in my mind.

13:51.067 --> 13:51.800
-For sure.
-Right.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.900
I think that James,
with the Tibetan skull,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.700
shows just a lot of raw talent.

13:57.433 --> 13:58.933
He got tricky.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.100
Josh's, I'm not crazy about
the style of the skull,

14:02.167 --> 14:03.567
but the outline is really clean,

14:03.633 --> 14:04.700
the color is really solid,

14:04.767 --> 14:05.900
the shading's really smooth.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.500
I actually thought
that the "New York" one...

14:08.567 --> 14:10.467
And I generally don't like
tattoos like that,

14:10.533 --> 14:11.800
but I liked that he brought

14:11.867 --> 14:14.100
some of his own life
and injected into it.

14:14.167 --> 14:15.633
The one with
the rose and the skull

14:15.700 --> 14:18.433
and the whole thing,
it's not done right.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.067
Outline, shading, and color,

14:20.133 --> 14:21.767
I'm not here to win
a popularity contest.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.433
I'm here to call it
like I see it.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.900
-[Oliver] Yeah.
-And that's a bad tattoo.

14:25.267 --> 14:26.733
-Yeah. Alright.
-Let's kick it off.

14:30.367 --> 14:31.433
For this challenge,

14:31.500 --> 14:33.867
we had you tattoo skulls
on these dead pigs.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.200
We're looking
for that visionary quality

14:36.267 --> 14:37.733
that signals raw talent.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.767
But one particular tattoo
impressed us the most.

14:45.767 --> 14:46.733
That was Josh's.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.400
-[applause]
-Thank you.

14:49.867 --> 14:50.933
[whistling]

14:51.000 --> 14:52.333
[Josh] I'm happy
coming out of the gate.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.067
I feel like
I'm gonna be the one

14:54.133 --> 14:55.867
that people are trying
to gun for now,

14:55.933 --> 14:57.533
which also could be a bad thing.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.733
But... we'll see.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.833
[Oliver] You showed raw talent.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.900
Good, clean outlines,

15:01.967 --> 15:03.133
lot of black shading.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.533
You really did your own style.

15:05.733 --> 15:08.033
And all of you that didn't
really shine today

15:08.100 --> 15:09.033
need to pick it up.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.700
As the winner
of the Flash Challenge,

15:12.767 --> 15:14.033
you'll be given first choice

15:14.100 --> 15:15.367
of all the human canvasses

15:15.700 --> 15:17.367
in this week's
elimination tattoo.

15:17.867 --> 15:18.933
And when you see what it is,

15:19.000 --> 15:20.733
you'll know why
it's a huge advantage.

15:21.733 --> 15:22.633
So head home.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.167
Get settled
into your new place.

15:24.633 --> 15:25.800
Next time,
someone's packing.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.867
[man] Ooh!

15:35.933 --> 15:36.833
[Jeremy] This is incredible.

15:37.367 --> 15:40.033
I never expected that I'd be
in a brownstone in New York.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.167
[B-Tat] Let's see
what's up here.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.200
[Al] I'ma grab my room.

15:42.267 --> 15:43.067
Word.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.800
We're bunkmates, Josh!

15:45.867 --> 15:47.233
-Yeah.
-We got the penthouse.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.267
You know what I'm saying?

15:48.333 --> 15:49.967
Bili, it is that
king size for you, man.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.767
-[Bili] No, man, I got--
-Come on, man.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.167
What're you talkin' about, man?

15:54.233 --> 15:56.900
[Bili] This Al dude seems
a little seedy.

15:56.967 --> 15:58.200
He seems like an instigator.

15:58.267 --> 15:59.833
We got the girls' room
right next to the kitchen,

15:59.900 --> 16:00.933
where y'all need to be,

16:01.000 --> 16:01.900
-so...
-Oh!.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.033
[Al] I'ma let y'all know
what I need for breakfast.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.300
Al Fliction

16:05.367 --> 16:07.500
is really kind of trying

16:07.567 --> 16:10.200
to get in our heads a bit.

16:10.267 --> 16:11.600
He's really obnoxious.

16:11.667 --> 16:12.700
You're from France?

16:12.767 --> 16:14.800
I know y'all know
how to cook real nice.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.967
My strategy
is to intimidate them,

16:17.033 --> 16:18.300
push up on them.

16:18.367 --> 16:19.900
I'm gonna show them
what Al Fliction is about.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.667
They will be afflicted.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.067
Uh-oh, look who it is.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.300
Trouble.

16:36.433 --> 16:38.267
-[man] Damn.
-[Al] Nice, man.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.067
[Dave] Hey, guys,
this is your work space.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.433
Take a look around.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.400
[man] Sick.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.267
-[man 1] Awesome.
-[man 2] Damn!

16:48.467 --> 16:50.900
Cool. I like my station.

16:50.967 --> 16:52.233
[Heather] I really love my shop.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.333
It's got my artwork on the wall.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.800
I'm very excited now
about this competition.

16:56.867 --> 16:59.067
I finally get to show
what I can do.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.800
What's up, big Al?

17:03.267 --> 17:04.400
[bleep] badass.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.032
Welcome, artists,

17:14.400 --> 17:15.967
to this week's
elimination tattoo.

17:16.867 --> 17:19.532
Over 20% of tattooed people
in the United States

17:19.599 --> 17:21.000
have at least one tattoo

17:21.067 --> 17:23.467
they either want removed
or covered-up.

17:23.532 --> 17:24.532
This week,

17:24.599 --> 17:26.300
the canvases
all have the same problem,

17:27.067 --> 17:28.000
tattoos they regret.

17:28.633 --> 17:30.667
This is the ultimate test
of raw talent.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.800
So, let's meet
these canvases.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.067
Canvases, please show
the artists

17:38.133 --> 17:39.200
the tattoos
you want covered-up.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.033
You guys can see,
we have crooked wings,

17:42.100 --> 17:43.800
a damaged military tattoo,

17:43.867 --> 17:45.767
a Pegasus, and many more.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.700
All of them
require creative solutions.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.800
You really need raw talent
to do a great cover-up.

17:51.867 --> 17:53.900
You have to know
how to disperse the dark

17:53.967 --> 17:55.567
throughout the entire tattoo

17:55.633 --> 17:57.233
so that you don't
just have a black blob.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.033
To do a cover-up just right,

17:59.100 --> 18:00.533
that takes a lot of raw talent.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.733
Alright, so, Josh,

18:02.333 --> 18:03.633
since you won
the Flash Challenge,

18:04.133 --> 18:05.733
you get to go ahead
and choose your subject.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.433
I know right away
I'm not messing

18:10.500 --> 18:12.500
with some wings on the back.

18:12.567 --> 18:14.933
I'm not going
for the Kanji with flames.

18:16.933 --> 18:17.800
I choose Justin.

18:19.567 --> 18:22.167
Choosing that one
was super easy because...

18:22.233 --> 18:24.867
I mean, it's the smallest
cover-up there.

18:24.933 --> 18:26.033
It was my advantage.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.233
I feel like I'm not gonna stress
the whole time

18:28.300 --> 18:29.800
trying to do the cover-up.

18:31.233 --> 18:32.567
[Al] I wouldn't have picked
the easiest one.

18:32.933 --> 18:33.900
You're being judged here.

18:34.333 --> 18:35.700
And if you're such
a good artist,

18:35.767 --> 18:36.667
and you're an Ink Master,

18:36.967 --> 18:38.233
just prove to the judges
that you got

18:38.300 --> 18:39.467
a little more skills than that.

18:39.533 --> 18:41.700
The rest of the canvases
will one by one

18:42.133 --> 18:43.900
choose their artist
by selecting a skull.

18:44.467 --> 18:45.933
Christine, why don't you
go ahead and pull a skull?

18:48.467 --> 18:49.967
-Jeremy?
-That's me.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.033
-James.
-[Dave] James.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.533
[James] Oh, Lord, have mercy.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.300
All these words
going down his arms.

18:56.367 --> 18:58.067
They weren't even in
any type of pattern.

18:58.467 --> 18:59.433
-Lea?
-Yeah.

18:59.833 --> 19:00.633
Brian.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.500
Bili?

19:03.100 --> 19:03.900
Heather?

19:04.833 --> 19:05.633
Tommy.

19:06.900 --> 19:07.700
Shane.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.133
Al.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.633
First elimination challenge,

19:11.700 --> 19:14.067
and I get the big,
giant cover-up.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.967
And that gives me more incentive
to prove that

19:16.033 --> 19:17.300
I can bang
with the best of 'em.

19:17.633 --> 19:18.767
You have the rest
of the afternoon

19:18.833 --> 19:20.467
to talk with
your human canvases

19:20.533 --> 19:22.167
and come up
with a design for tomorrow.

19:22.533 --> 19:25.033
You'll have six hours
to do this tattoo.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.033
I don't think it's fair
to put a time limit

19:27.100 --> 19:29.000
on doing a tattoo, period.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.000
And six hours
is pretty ridiculous.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.133
Good luck tomorrow.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
[Dave] The unsung heroes
of this entire competition

19:37.067 --> 19:38.100
are the human canvases.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.233
They're coming in here

19:39.600 --> 19:42.100
to get permanently tattooed

19:42.167 --> 19:44.467
with art from someone
they don't know,

19:44.533 --> 19:46.533
not even knowing
what they're gonna get.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.100
And they're rolling the dice.

19:49.133 --> 19:50.067
[Tommy] It's gonna
be awesome, man.

19:50.367 --> 19:52.233
We're gonna do something
really beautiful for you.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.433
[Tommy] The rules of thumb when
approaching a cover-up are,

19:54.500 --> 19:56.300
you're not covering a tattoo,
what you're doing is

19:56.367 --> 19:57.467
you're actually
camouflaging it.

19:57.533 --> 19:58.900
The darks are always
gonna be in there.

19:58.967 --> 20:01.167
The blacks, certainly,
are always gonna be there.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.133
So what you're trying to do is
work with what's there

20:03.200 --> 20:05.000
and make something
brand-new for the person.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
It's a good choice

20:07.667 --> 20:08.967
for a cover-up,
because it's lighter,

20:09.033 --> 20:11.167
there's no bold,
dark outlines on it.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.167
Alrighty.

20:13.867 --> 20:15.200
We will do
something awesome

20:15.267 --> 20:16.367
-to really make it...
-I know.

20:16.433 --> 20:17.400
-I'm so excited.
-...way different.

20:18.733 --> 20:20.700
Okay, see how these are,
like, really rigid?

20:20.767 --> 20:22.000
-[Christine] Yeah.
-I think making the wings

20:22.067 --> 20:23.233
like that
will be really awesome.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.567
Yes.

20:24.633 --> 20:26.233
[Jeremy] Why are you getting
this covered-up, exactly?

20:26.300 --> 20:28.367
Uh, my wedding
is in September,

20:28.433 --> 20:30.333
and I want
to have something

20:30.400 --> 20:32.067
that I can be
proud of.

20:32.133 --> 20:33.400
I'm kind of freaked out

20:33.467 --> 20:35.533
about how this
elimination tattoo is gonna go.

20:35.967 --> 20:37.733
Covering up
giant wings like this

20:38.067 --> 20:39.833
is a difficult task.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.400
And I'm only gonna have
six hours to do this tattoo?

20:42.667 --> 20:43.867
This just seems insane.

20:55.767 --> 20:56.767
I wanna let all y'all know,

20:57.100 --> 20:58.533
if anything goes bad today,

20:58.833 --> 20:59.867
it was a pleasure already

20:59.933 --> 21:01.333
just living with you guys
one night.

21:01.867 --> 21:03.167
I feel like
y'all family already.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.067
We should open
a shop after this,

21:05.133 --> 21:05.933
all together, man.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.600
Oh, I know one thing is,
they gonna lose,

21:09.233 --> 21:11.233
'cause Al Fliction
is here to stay.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.767
-Tommy, man.
-[Tommy] I love you, Al.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.567
-No [bleep] cryin', bro.
-Christ!

21:14.633 --> 21:15.700
Come on, B.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.067
Let's get out of here.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.000
[Dave] Morning, everybody.

21:20.333 --> 21:22.467
You have six hours
to complete your tattoo.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.467
The judges will be looking
for highly imaginative art

21:25.767 --> 21:26.867
that turns bad work

21:26.933 --> 21:28.967
into something your canvases
can be proud of.

21:29.233 --> 21:30.400
Canvases, come on in.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.967
Would you go ahead
and get with your artists?

21:34.700 --> 21:36.433
Clock starts now.

21:39.467 --> 21:40.433
When doing a cover-up,

21:40.500 --> 21:42.200
you have to envision

21:42.767 --> 21:44.000
your final product

21:44.067 --> 21:46.000
on top of something else.

21:46.067 --> 21:48.200
The raw talent
really comes into play

21:48.267 --> 21:50.200
on being able to know
what it's gonna look like

21:50.267 --> 21:51.167
before you do it.

21:51.767 --> 21:54.200
-[Bili] Here is it.
-That is sick!

21:54.667 --> 21:55.800
-Are you happy with it?
-[woman] Yeah.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.500
-It looks awesome.
-Awesome.

21:58.533 --> 22:01.100
So, the cover-up part

22:01.167 --> 22:02.433
will be right in here.

22:02.700 --> 22:03.800
[man] Think that'll work.

22:04.233 --> 22:05.367
-Ready?
-Let's go.

22:05.433 --> 22:06.267
[Jeremy] Alright.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.133
[machine buzzing]

22:09.767 --> 22:10.700
You're doing great.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.033
It feels good
to know that there's an artist

22:13.100 --> 22:14.800
who wants to help.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.167
My wedding is coming up,

22:16.233 --> 22:18.267
and I have
a beautiful wedding dress.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.367
And I don't know what I would do
if I have to have this tattoo.

22:21.433 --> 22:22.433
[crying]

22:23.800 --> 22:25.233
[bleep] [bleep]

22:25.300 --> 22:26.200
[groans softly]

22:30.200 --> 22:31.400
What made you
go to Koi Fish?

22:31.467 --> 22:34.567
I've always wanted one,
and it just never happened.

22:34.633 --> 22:36.667
You know,
I do realistic-type stuff.

22:36.733 --> 22:39.100
The Koi Fish itself,
I'm confident with it.

22:39.167 --> 22:40.767
I'd traced the cover-up.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.567
The bulk of the body
falls right over the top of it.

22:42.867 --> 22:44.533
The only challenge
for me right now

22:44.600 --> 22:46.400
is to get it done
in six hours, you know?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.233
Alright, that's five hours left.

22:56.633 --> 22:58.000
I lay down 90% of my clients

22:58.067 --> 22:59.900
just to make them comfortable
and feel at ease

22:59.967 --> 23:01.667
throughout the whole
entire tattoo,

23:01.733 --> 23:03.367
and that helps so much.

23:05.167 --> 23:07.200
[Christine groaning, screaming]

23:08.400 --> 23:09.367
Two lines in

23:09.433 --> 23:10.800
and this girl
is already screaming.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.967
[groaning]

23:13.033 --> 23:14.300
[Christine] No, no, no, no, no!

23:15.767 --> 23:17.633
She is so uncomfortable
sitting like that.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.900
If she was lying down,

23:18.967 --> 23:20.967
would she be able
to relax a little?

23:21.033 --> 23:22.333
-I mean--
-He is a tattooer, right?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.833
-He should've known to do that.
-He should know this.

23:23.900 --> 23:24.767
He should know this.

23:24.833 --> 23:27.200
[screams] No, don't! Don't!

23:27.267 --> 23:28.633
[Jeremy] She's moving
all over the place.

23:28.933 --> 23:30.200
If she can't sit still,

23:30.567 --> 23:32.167
she's gonna have
a bad tattoo.

23:32.833 --> 23:33.567
Are you alright?

23:34.567 --> 23:36.833
I really don't know
what Jeremy is doing in there,

23:36.900 --> 23:38.400
but whatever he's doing,
it's wrong.

23:39.367 --> 23:40.800
He's screwing up somewhere.

23:40.867 --> 23:41.933
Nobody should be screaming.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.533
Alright, guys,
four hours to go.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.200
[Oliver] You the one here
doing all that yelling?

23:52.267 --> 23:54.267
Nope. You won't
hear me screaming.

23:55.233 --> 23:56.833
[Oliver] That's a big cover-up
for a little tat.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.867
You got a lot of clean skin
to work with.

23:59.467 --> 24:00.967
You feel like that advantage
is helping you out?

24:03.867 --> 24:04.833
What's up, Mr. Al?

24:05.133 --> 24:07.267
-How are you doing today?
-Man, you know,

24:07.333 --> 24:08.667
I got the big whopper.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.667
Since it was
such a big tattoo to cover-up,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.900
kind of incorporated
a dragon's face,

24:14.967 --> 24:17.400
and I'm using the fire
and all the flame work

24:17.767 --> 24:18.933
as part of the new design.

24:19.467 --> 24:22.333
This way, I only end up
having to cover half of it

24:22.400 --> 24:23.667
and rejuvenating
the other half.

24:23.733 --> 24:24.567
I think it's smart.

24:25.133 --> 24:26.167
I'm trying
to get it in, man.

24:27.033 --> 24:27.833
Well, good luck.

24:31.767 --> 24:33.233
The stakes are high
for these people

24:33.300 --> 24:34.500
that come in to get tattoos

24:34.567 --> 24:37.267
because they're gonna be
permanently marked forever.

24:37.333 --> 24:39.300
I mean, some of the
greatest artists in the world

24:39.367 --> 24:40.967
have made mistakes on people.

24:41.033 --> 24:43.200
-I was very nervous.
-[Tommy] Don't worry.

24:43.267 --> 24:45.400
I'm glad that
I'm not freaking out. [laughs]

24:46.700 --> 24:48.033
-[Chris] B-Tat.
-What's up, man?

24:48.500 --> 24:49.300
How's it looking?

24:49.767 --> 24:50.800
It's coming along good.

24:50.867 --> 24:52.367
Getting a cover-up
on right there.

24:52.433 --> 24:53.933
I was gonna do it
with this Foo dog.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.767
Nice. You do a lot of Japanese?

24:55.833 --> 24:56.633
No.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.833
I just do whatever
the customers bring.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.033
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

25:00.100 --> 25:02.067
An Ink Master is somebody
that could actually

25:02.133 --> 25:03.833
take on any style.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.467
Anything that the client
has in mind,

25:05.533 --> 25:07.333
they'll take that idea,

25:07.400 --> 25:08.767
adopt it to their style,

25:08.833 --> 25:10.133
and give it back to the client

25:10.433 --> 25:11.933
in the most beautiful,
flawless way.

25:12.267 --> 25:13.233
That's an Ink Master.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.633
[Dave]
Two hours left, everybody.

25:22.567 --> 25:23.367
[Christine screaming]

25:29.900 --> 25:31.667
[crying] No! I can't!
I can't! I can't!

25:34.233 --> 25:36.133
I can't...
I can't do it anymore.

25:37.267 --> 25:38.167
[sobbing] I can't.

25:41.467 --> 25:42.267
You okay?

25:43.567 --> 25:44.367
You wanna keep going?

25:45.100 --> 25:46.033
I can't.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.667
This is absolutely
the worst client

25:49.733 --> 25:51.233
that I've ever had
sit for me.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.700
[Christine] I can't
do it anymore.

25:52.767 --> 25:53.600
I can't.

25:55.767 --> 25:57.567
I dealt with the pain
as much as I could

25:58.300 --> 26:00.233
so that I could show
my family and friends

26:00.300 --> 26:01.333
this beautiful tattoo.

26:01.733 --> 26:04.300
But I had to stop.
I couldn't do it anymore.

26:05.167 --> 26:06.233
[Christine] This is
so embarrassing.

26:06.867 --> 26:07.967
[sniffling]

26:08.033 --> 26:09.300
There's 100 grand
on the line here,

26:09.733 --> 26:12.200
and it sucks that I got stuck
with this girl

26:12.267 --> 26:13.500
for my first client.

26:13.567 --> 26:15.133
She's going a little crazy
and freaking out.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.667
[bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]

26:16.733 --> 26:18.733
[bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]

26:20.900 --> 26:22.200
[Jeremy] She might be
the one thing

26:22.267 --> 26:23.567
that causes me to go home.

26:26.567 --> 26:27.767
Bring it on. I know you guys

26:27.833 --> 26:29.033
are gonna tear me up.
Let's go.

26:29.367 --> 26:30.833
You didn't really wow us.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.467
You're bumped, you're lumped,
you're not straight.

26:33.533 --> 26:34.800
You put your balls
on the table,

26:34.867 --> 26:36.333
and I feel like
you hacked them off.

26:45.733 --> 26:47.667
Alright, guys,
15 minutes left.

26:55.033 --> 26:55.833
[Lea] Oh, my God.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.333
[Lea] The clock is running down,

26:58.400 --> 27:00.867
and I am not done
with Edward's tattoo.

27:01.233 --> 27:04.000
I just put all the fire
around the skull,

27:04.067 --> 27:07.100
and everything looks orange.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.100
I have to go back in there
and put some contrast.

27:10.167 --> 27:11.967
I'm afraid I'm not going gonna
have the time to do that.

27:12.300 --> 27:13.533
[Dave] One minute warning, guys.

27:20.067 --> 27:22.467
[Dave] Okay, in five, four,

27:23.233 --> 27:26.233
three, two, one.

27:26.300 --> 27:27.800
That's it. Time is up.

27:28.133 --> 27:29.000
Machines down.

27:30.000 --> 27:30.900
Alright, John.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.767
Only took six hours.

27:34.033 --> 27:36.467
[man] Looks good.
Looks real good, man.

27:36.533 --> 27:39.267
[Lea] Basically,
the tattoo was orange.

27:39.833 --> 27:41.600
I wish I had more time
to trick it out

27:41.667 --> 27:43.500
to the way I wanted to.

27:43.567 --> 27:44.833
[Jeremy] I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

27:44.900 --> 27:45.967
I have a tattoo

27:46.033 --> 27:49.067
that's barely got
any work done on it.

27:49.133 --> 27:50.833
Because of that, I think
I might be going home today.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.333
[Al] Come here, Jeremy.
What the hell happened?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.633
What, you had
a jackhammer in there?

27:59.700 --> 28:00.733
[Jeremy] I don't know, man.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.367
She needed a muffler,
that's all I know.

28:02.633 --> 28:04.300
Some people
just can't take pain.

28:04.833 --> 28:05.867
Ah!

28:05.933 --> 28:07.600
[Al] I'm not feeling bad
for Jeremy.

28:07.667 --> 28:08.533
He's my competition.

28:08.933 --> 28:10.567
And if he can't get it right,
that's on him.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.167
One less person for me
to have to worry about.

28:13.633 --> 28:14.867
So, what happens now?
You're not, like,

28:14.933 --> 28:16.467
-in this competition now?
-No, I am.

28:16.533 --> 28:17.433
They're gonna judge that?

28:17.700 --> 28:19.700
Somebody here
gets eliminated, and I stay,

28:19.767 --> 28:21.000
that's not fair to you guys.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.600
But if you get eliminated,

28:22.667 --> 28:23.833
-that's not fair.
-...that's not fair to me.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.967
Should nobody go home
in a situation like this?

28:38.267 --> 28:39.833
The tattoos are finished.

28:39.900 --> 28:42.467
Now it's time to take a look
at the work and judge it.

28:45.767 --> 28:46.933
Welcome, artists.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.400
Jeremy, you're up first.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.800
Your assignment today was to fix
the crooked angel wings.

28:55.833 --> 28:57.100
It's hard for me to comment,

28:57.167 --> 28:58.700
because clearly,
you haven't finished here.

28:59.067 --> 29:00.667
[Jeremy] She had a tough time
from the very beginning.

29:01.467 --> 29:02.800
[groaning, screaming]

29:02.867 --> 29:04.167
[bleep] [bleep]

29:04.233 --> 29:05.467
[groans softly]

29:05.533 --> 29:07.000
[Jeremy] It would have been
awesome in the end,

29:07.067 --> 29:08.333
but we didn't get there.

29:09.133 --> 29:10.433
It might have been
a lot better

29:10.500 --> 29:12.133
if she would've been
in a comfortable position.

29:12.767 --> 29:14.500
I didn't really
consider it too much,

29:14.567 --> 29:16.133
just because the difficulty

29:16.200 --> 29:19.000
that you run into when tattooing
the middle of a back.

29:19.067 --> 29:21.467
I think plenty of back pieces
have been done laying down.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.300
You really didn't get enough in
to really show me

29:25.367 --> 29:26.600
what the end product
was gonna be.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.667
So, we're gonna have to go
with what we have to judge.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.200
Yeah.

29:34.233 --> 29:35.333
Josh, why don't you
come up front.

29:37.700 --> 29:38.700
You had first pick.

29:39.433 --> 29:40.867
-How do you think it went today?
-[Josh] Great.

29:40.933 --> 29:42.367
I feel like I did
have the advantage

29:42.433 --> 29:44.800
from winning
the Flash Challenge.

29:44.867 --> 29:48.033
I felt like I executed
the tattoo the way I needed to.

29:48.100 --> 29:49.667
[Chris] You banged out
a big tattoo.

29:49.733 --> 29:50.967
You banged out
a bright tattoo.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.300
I would have definitely
liked to have seen

29:53.367 --> 29:54.467
you hit raw talent

29:54.867 --> 29:56.200
by picking a tougher tattoo.

29:56.633 --> 29:58.033
I would like to see you
push yourself,

29:58.100 --> 30:00.000
and I would really like
to see other styles from you.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.733
You had a very easy ride.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.567
You had something
that was super easy to cover.

30:06.433 --> 30:07.700
You didn't really wow us

30:08.100 --> 30:08.967
with the challenge.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.600
Heather.

30:16.533 --> 30:17.600
Bring it on. I know you guys

30:17.667 --> 30:18.867
are gonna tear me up.
Let's go.

30:20.633 --> 30:21.433
Slow down.

30:22.233 --> 30:24.200
You got the old veteran.

30:24.267 --> 30:25.667
He had a military tattoo.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.300
[Chris] This tattoo,

30:28.367 --> 30:30.367
your drapery and your folds
in the bottom of it,

30:30.433 --> 30:31.200
you lost it.

30:31.867 --> 30:33.233
I feel like I did
a pretty good tattoo

30:33.300 --> 30:34.567
considering the circumstance,

30:34.633 --> 30:36.733
considering the pressure
applied to us.

30:37.033 --> 30:38.467
But, again, we're here
in a competition,

30:38.533 --> 30:40.800
you're competing
for $100,000.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.267
In the jawline,
you kind of lost the jaw.

30:47.333 --> 30:48.633
You kind of, like,
let the cheek go,

30:48.700 --> 30:50.767
so it kind of just
blended back directly.

30:50.833 --> 30:52.167
There wasn't, like, a definition

30:52.233 --> 30:54.100
where the face
cut off from the hair.

30:54.167 --> 30:55.100
There's not an ear.

30:56.067 --> 30:57.033
She has an ear.

30:58.767 --> 31:00.667
The tattoo doesn't lie,
and neither does the photo.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.067
Al Fliction.

31:09.133 --> 31:12.067
-How did it go today?
-I had one of the tough ones.

31:12.133 --> 31:13.833
I was able to at least
to come up with something

31:13.900 --> 31:15.900
to incorporate
what was there already,

31:15.967 --> 31:17.267
because if I had to
cover the whole thing,

31:17.333 --> 31:18.467
I wouldn't have had enough time.

31:19.367 --> 31:21.300
Why wouldn't you
really hit

31:21.367 --> 31:24.300
a nice, big, clean
frontal dragon head

31:24.367 --> 31:25.433
instead of the mush?

31:26.367 --> 31:27.333
You look like you're rushing.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.100
The quality of your line work,

31:31.167 --> 31:32.833
the quality of your shading,

31:32.900 --> 31:33.967
you're not hitting it clean.

31:35.267 --> 31:36.733
The cover-up attempt
was sick,

31:37.400 --> 31:38.567
but did it work?

31:39.000 --> 31:39.833
I'm not sold.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.233
Shane.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.967
You got to cover-up

31:51.033 --> 31:53.433
a pretty faded tattoo
to begin with.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.533
[Shane] Yeah, it wasn't too bad.

31:55.600 --> 31:56.833
[Oliver] The tattoo is clean,

31:57.733 --> 31:59.333
precise, smooth.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.167
Feel like, maybe,

32:01.233 --> 32:03.200
you got a little easy on it.

32:03.267 --> 32:05.333
It's kind of like
a black and gray tat,

32:05.400 --> 32:07.800
but then there was a little bit
of green peeking out.

32:07.867 --> 32:09.200
So you just put
green everywhere.

32:10.233 --> 32:11.433
The tattoo is solid.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.100
The cover-up works,

32:14.100 --> 32:15.933
but the actual artwork

32:16.400 --> 32:18.067
didn't line up.

32:18.133 --> 32:20.000
The head is much bigger
than the tail.

32:20.067 --> 32:21.167
The tail is not big enough

32:21.233 --> 32:22.367
to propel the head.

32:23.800 --> 32:24.767
You didn't hit the mark.

32:26.900 --> 32:27.733
Bili.

32:30.233 --> 32:32.400
Bili, you got a pretty easy one
to cover.

32:34.433 --> 32:36.233
Detail in the cover-up part,

32:36.900 --> 32:37.600
excellent.

32:37.867 --> 32:39.400
Picking the eye
was a great idea.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.067
You know, that eye
looks like it's wet.

32:43.433 --> 32:44.267
Really well done, man.

32:44.933 --> 32:45.733
Thanks.

32:49.900 --> 32:50.700
[Dave] Lea.

32:52.933 --> 32:53.967
How did it go for you today?

32:54.300 --> 32:56.333
I could have used
a little bit more time

32:56.400 --> 32:58.533
to push a little more contrast

32:58.600 --> 32:59.833
where the cover-up was.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.233
The only comment I'd had

33:02.567 --> 33:04.000
is Edward himself...

33:05.133 --> 33:06.933
is a little
on the orange-side.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.800
And there was a lot of orange
going on in this ink.

33:09.867 --> 33:10.967
So, color-wise,

33:11.033 --> 33:12.033
it was hard to...

33:12.733 --> 33:15.000
differentiate between
Edward and the tat.

33:16.067 --> 33:17.167
One thing you're lacking

33:17.500 --> 33:20.067
is a bolder, harder outline.

33:20.133 --> 33:21.600
I feel like
you're a little bit soft

33:21.667 --> 33:24.033
to be doing such a big,
explosive color piece.

33:24.867 --> 33:25.800
These are my issues.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.167
Tommy, come on up front.

33:33.833 --> 33:35.367
You did an excellent job
with the cover-up.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.767
It was definitely tricky.

33:38.833 --> 33:40.833
And even in the parts
where the former tattoo

33:40.900 --> 33:41.900
might show a little bit,

33:42.733 --> 33:44.167
you put wispy lines

33:44.233 --> 33:46.600
to help make it look like
there's stuff going on there.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.833
If I had to say
anything negative about it,

33:49.400 --> 33:51.867
it's just that some of the areas
in the cover-up area,

33:51.933 --> 33:53.233
you used some white highlights
a little bit,

33:53.300 --> 33:55.800
which might get a little muddy
over time.

33:56.233 --> 33:57.767
But you did a really good job.

34:01.133 --> 34:01.933
B-Tat.

34:04.267 --> 34:06.333
So you had to cover-up
the Pegasus.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.833
-[B-Tat] Yeah.
-[Dave] How'd it go for you?

34:08.766 --> 34:10.067
[B-Tat] I t went good.

34:10.132 --> 34:11.199
Just trying
to make it disappear.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.766
You have to be able
to line these things right.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.100
If you're gonna do the circles

34:15.167 --> 34:16.667
in the top of the hair
of the Foo dog,

34:16.733 --> 34:18.233
it's got to be
that smooth motion.

34:19.067 --> 34:19.833
You're bumped.

34:20.567 --> 34:21.800
You're lumped.

34:21.867 --> 34:23.833
You're not straight.
You look nervous.

34:24.733 --> 34:25.500
You are off.

34:26.667 --> 34:27.567
It's my opinion.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.167
James, let's have you
in the center.

34:32.167 --> 34:33.199
So you had...
What was it,

34:33.266 --> 34:34.632
the "Live, love..."

34:34.699 --> 34:36.733
[James] Yeah, all those letters.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.067
I'm about passed out
when he came into my room

34:39.132 --> 34:40.933
and said, "I want an armor."

34:41.000 --> 34:42.132
[Dave] I can still see

34:42.199 --> 34:43.733
a little bit of the cover-up
poking out

34:43.800 --> 34:45.100
between the feathers
here and there.

34:45.467 --> 34:47.167
It was tough to get him...
get it all out.

34:47.533 --> 34:48.833
I would have liked
to have seen you

34:48.900 --> 34:50.632
keep everything
a little bit straighter.

34:50.699 --> 34:53.132
To me, that was the part
that you didn't push it home.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.433
Alright, guys.
Head back to the Brownstone.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.267
For one of you guys,

35:00.333 --> 35:01.533
it's gonna be
the last time you're there.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.833
Someone's lack of raw talent
will be sending 'em home.

35:11.933 --> 35:13.433
[Tommy] There was some
[bleep] hard ones.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.033
Like really, really
hard ones in there

35:15.100 --> 35:17.900
that were near-impossible
to get done in six hours.

35:17.967 --> 35:19.600
It was tougher
than I thought it was gonna be.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.400
Our goals
were to cover it up,

35:21.467 --> 35:23.200
so if you couldn't
see that tattoo in the end,

35:23.533 --> 35:25.833
we succeeded
what we were supposed to do.

35:25.900 --> 35:27.800
[Jeremy] I know that my tattoo
would have been great,

35:28.100 --> 35:30.033
but they have to judge it off
of what they see.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.033
And they don't see very much.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.200
I got a bad feeling about it.

35:41.867 --> 35:42.933
[Dave] Alright, guys.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.133
Who do you think showed
the most raw talent,

35:45.200 --> 35:46.500
and who do you think
was just raw?

35:47.233 --> 35:48.667
What about B-Tat?

35:48.733 --> 35:50.567
I didn't dig that tattoo at all.

35:50.633 --> 35:52.233
[Oliver] It's really
hard to find

35:52.300 --> 35:53.467
much good to say about it.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.400
He couldn't outline
that thing clean.

35:56.467 --> 35:57.933
Wait till that thing heals.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.533
It's just chewed up flesh.

36:00.667 --> 36:01.467
That's not cool.

36:01.967 --> 36:04.400
But there were some
other winners on this panel.

36:04.733 --> 36:06.300
So let's get into Jeremy.

36:06.367 --> 36:07.233
That was rough.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.367
[Chris] Yeah, Jeremy had

36:08.433 --> 36:10.167
a tough run
with the client and all.

36:10.233 --> 36:11.733
[Oliver] It might have been
a lot better

36:11.800 --> 36:13.000
if she would have been
laying down.

36:13.067 --> 36:14.967
But the difficulty
in judging, still,

36:15.033 --> 36:16.500
is everybody
had a different challenge.

36:16.567 --> 36:17.733
So we gotta
look beyond that and see

36:17.800 --> 36:19.467
how they did with
what they had to work with.

36:19.533 --> 36:20.467
Yeah.

36:20.533 --> 36:22.967
So I think that Jeremy's
on thin ice.

36:23.633 --> 36:25.967
I would think
that Heather's on thin ice.

36:26.033 --> 36:27.567
I would have been really
bummed out

36:27.633 --> 36:30.100
if I'd served this
great nation of ours,

36:30.167 --> 36:33.000
went for the Statue of Liberty
to commemorate my service,

36:33.933 --> 36:35.633
and walked out with that.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.033
[Chris]
It's attention to detail.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.933
How does the Statue of Liberty
not have an ear or hair?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.567
Where's the jaw?
What was that?

36:41.633 --> 36:43.033
There was no cover-up up there.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.867
There was
no reason in hell that

36:44.933 --> 36:46.267
that face needed
to look like that.

36:47.133 --> 36:48.633
[Dave] What about Tommy?

36:48.700 --> 36:50.300
[Oliver] He didn't have
an easy cover-up.

36:50.367 --> 36:52.100
He had a hard spot to work with.

36:52.167 --> 36:54.567
He had a lot of fine
detailed lines in his design

36:54.633 --> 36:55.933
that weren't easy to do.

36:56.533 --> 36:58.133
What about Shane?
He did the Koi.

36:59.133 --> 37:00.000
I loved that Koi.

37:00.467 --> 37:02.433
Dude, he is such
a technical tattooer.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.267
Well, I think
it's pretty clear

37:05.033 --> 37:05.833
who's out of here.

37:06.533 --> 37:07.600
-You want to go grab 'em?
-Alright.

37:07.667 --> 37:08.700
-See y'all in a bit.
-Alright, man.

37:14.667 --> 37:15.767
[Oliver] Alright, guys,
listen up.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.833
The judges need
to see Tommy, Shane,

37:19.367 --> 37:20.933
B-Tat, and Jeremy.

37:37.333 --> 37:38.233
[Dave] Here's the deal.

37:38.300 --> 37:39.467
In this group of four,

37:40.167 --> 37:42.367
there's a top two
and there's a bottom two.

37:45.933 --> 37:46.900
Tommy and Shane,

37:48.267 --> 37:49.633
why do you think
you two are standing here?

37:50.833 --> 37:52.733
Hopefully, commend us
a little bit

37:52.800 --> 37:54.167
for putting out a good effort.

37:54.233 --> 37:56.500
I would hope to think that
I'm not getting eliminated yet.

38:03.267 --> 38:04.967
Good news is,
you guys are in the top two.

38:07.067 --> 38:08.133
And Tommy,

38:08.200 --> 38:10.300
the judges feel
that you did the best work.

38:10.733 --> 38:11.533
Thank you.

38:12.633 --> 38:14.633
You really worked
the design

38:14.700 --> 38:16.033
to fit right over top.

38:17.767 --> 38:19.000
-Nice job.
-Thank you, Chris.

38:21.067 --> 38:23.200
So if there's a top two,
that can only mean one thing.

38:24.367 --> 38:25.633
Jeremy and B-Tat,

38:26.533 --> 38:27.533
you guys are the bottom two.

38:29.767 --> 38:31.200
Tell us why you think
you should stay here

38:31.267 --> 38:32.233
in this competition.

38:32.767 --> 38:33.600
B-Tat.

38:34.233 --> 38:35.733
I feel like the tattoo I did

38:35.800 --> 38:37.733
covered the aspect
of doing the cover-up,

38:38.067 --> 38:41.333
and I would just like
another chance to prove myself.

38:42.233 --> 38:43.600
I don't know if it's nerves,

38:43.667 --> 38:46.600
I don't know
if it's lack of experience,

38:46.667 --> 38:49.633
your line work didn't come out
the way your drawing looked.

38:51.033 --> 38:52.067
It's not cool

38:52.400 --> 38:53.900
to do stuff
that you can't pull off.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.433
I'm sorry, man,
but this is all-around bad.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.333
You put
your balls on the table,

39:00.400 --> 39:01.600
and I feel like
you hacked 'em off.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.400
Jeremy.

39:06.800 --> 39:07.800
I think I should stay

39:07.867 --> 39:09.667
because I just haven't had
an opportunity

39:09.733 --> 39:12.100
to show what I can do yet.

39:12.167 --> 39:13.367
I would have
had that opportunity

39:13.433 --> 39:14.867
if my client had sat
for the whole tattoo.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.900
As soon as she showed
signs of discomfort,

39:17.967 --> 39:20.767
you should've taken her out
of that uncomfortable position

39:20.833 --> 39:21.833
she was in that chair.

39:22.467 --> 39:23.300
I disagree.

39:23.367 --> 39:24.300
-You're kidding.
-[Jeremy] No.

39:25.267 --> 39:26.567
Had I laid her down,

39:26.633 --> 39:29.700
I would've been working
in awkward positions anyways.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.400
That's what tattooers do.
You have to work around it.

39:32.467 --> 39:33.600
We all are sitting
hunched over

39:33.667 --> 39:35.333
because we've tattooed
for 20 years.

39:35.867 --> 39:37.033
I would rather get eliminated

39:37.100 --> 39:38.733
knowing I took
the responsible route

39:38.800 --> 39:40.533
instead of just trying
to get it done.

39:41.567 --> 39:43.500
I kept her in the best position
to do it better.

39:44.833 --> 39:46.567
As a judge, I firmly disagree.

39:49.867 --> 39:50.667
B-Tat...

39:51.833 --> 39:52.633
Jeremy...

39:53.000 --> 39:55.233
one of you
will be sent home.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.800
B-Tat...

40:06.600 --> 40:09.267
you don't have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

40:11.233 --> 40:12.833
I need you to pack up
your machines

40:13.600 --> 40:14.433
and close shop.

40:15.833 --> 40:17.833
-Sorry, man.
-[B-Tat] It's all good.

40:19.633 --> 40:21.267
[B-Tat] I'm, like, really,
really, like, pissed

40:21.333 --> 40:22.767
that I'm not going to win
the 100 grand.

40:22.833 --> 40:24.400
I'ma continue
doing my tattoos,

40:24.467 --> 40:26.133
I'ma take care my family.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.633
For what it is,

40:27.700 --> 40:29.633
it was, like, the greatest thing
that could ever happen to me.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.667
Well, Jeremy, we know
you had a rough day.

40:35.733 --> 40:37.433
The shading
that you got in there

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
is solid and smooth.

40:39.567 --> 40:42.033
I know she was moving a lot,
and so you didn't get a chance

40:42.100 --> 40:43.700
to get a good, clean,
solid outline in there.

40:44.267 --> 40:45.200
[Dave] Skin of your teeth, dude.

40:45.633 --> 40:47.233
-Skin of your teeth.
-Thank you.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.667
[narrator] On the next episode
of Ink Master...

40:56.733 --> 40:58.733
[Dave] Today, we have
a very special guest judge.

40:58.800 --> 40:59.567
Ton Jones.

41:00.233 --> 41:01.333
[Dave] Look at these lines.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.267
You wouldn't want to [bleep] up
this guy, right?

41:03.333 --> 41:05.200
[Dave] You're lucky you're only
doing cars today.

41:05.267 --> 41:07.533
[Heather] This [bleep]
is hard to do.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.833
[bleep] hard as hell
to get that [bleep]

41:08.900 --> 41:10.067
straight all the way around.

41:10.133 --> 41:11.967
What do you want?
You want me to [bleep] judge

41:12.033 --> 41:13.300
from this little [bleep]
you did?

41:13.733 --> 41:15.467
If you don't wanna do it,
hey, there's the door.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.300
[Dave] Clock starts now.

41:18.867 --> 41:19.967
It looks like
you're working like

41:20.033 --> 41:21.000
there's money on the line.

41:21.467 --> 41:22.967
-[bleep]
-[Bili] Could you get EMT?
