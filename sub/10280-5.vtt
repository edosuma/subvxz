WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:05.806
Previously on ER:

00:05.839 --> 00:08.609
When you're waiting
on a patient's results

00:08.642 --> 00:10.711
it's not necessary
for you to boff

00:10.744 --> 00:12.713
that patient's mother
in the storage closet.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.082
I'm so sorry, Robert.

00:14.115 --> 00:17.285
About my arm,
or about my being there?

00:17.318 --> 00:18.619
A memo from Weaver.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.688
I've made Abby
the new nurse manager.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.756
The job is yours,
like it or not.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.125
"Like it or not"?

00:24.158 --> 00:25.226
I don't care
to argue about it.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.668
Duroziez's sign
is a to and fro murmur

00:34.702 --> 00:36.204
when the stethoscope
is placed

00:36.237 --> 00:37.805
over the femoral artery.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.808
What's another peripheral sign
of aortic insufficiency?

00:40.841 --> 00:42.210
Weak pulse.
No.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.377
Poor cap refill.
No.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.179
Those are both signs
of shock.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.580
It begins with
"Q." Anyone?

00:46.614 --> 00:47.715
DeQuervain's.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.283
No, that begins
with a "D"

00:49.317 --> 00:51.285
although there is
a "Q" in it

00:51.319 --> 00:52.686
so, you're
getting warmer.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.089
Does Quinkie's sign
ring any bells?

00:55.123 --> 00:57.658
And it manifests
itself how?

00:57.691 --> 01:01.362
With a visible...
puh...

01:01.395 --> 01:02.330
Pulsation.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.565
Correct. Where?

01:04.598 --> 01:07.301
On the... nnn...

01:07.335 --> 01:08.436
Neck.

01:08.469 --> 01:09.770
Navel?

01:09.803 --> 01:12.206
Nail bed.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.807
Good night.

01:13.841 --> 01:14.875
Go home.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.277
Rounds start

01:16.310 --> 01:17.545
at 7:00 a.m.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.280
Be sure to read
Sabiston's chapter

01:19.313 --> 01:20.448
on the acute abdomen.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.283
So much for the future
of medicine.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.518
Jacy, would you be sure
to ring Mr. Ingles?

01:24.552 --> 01:27.155
Remind him not to eat anything
after midnight.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.823
I don't want to have to
reschedule his hernia yet again.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.325
I'm going trick-or-treating.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.460
Oh, what's Ella this year?

01:32.493 --> 01:33.527
A cow.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.296
Wasn't she a cow
last year?

01:35.329 --> 01:39.200
No, last year she was Dorothy,
I was the Cowardly Lion, Mark...

01:39.233 --> 01:41.202
Mark was the Scarecrow.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.603
Right.

01:42.636 --> 01:46.374
I get to be a farmer this year.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.376
Happy Halloween.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.743
Dr. Corday.
Yeah.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.679
Your med student called--
Nathan.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.615
What, the one
who didn't bother
to show up today?

01:54.648 --> 01:57.718
He said he'd be here
in a few minutes
to speak with you.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.553
Well, it's too late.

01:59.587 --> 02:02.290
Dr. Romano would also
like to talk with you
before you leave.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.524
Tell him you couldn't find me.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.659
ROMANO:
I heard that!

02:10.464 --> 02:12.400
FRANK:
What the hell are
you supposed to be?

02:12.433 --> 02:13.834
Hey, you want a
candy, little fella?

02:13.867 --> 02:16.770
FRANK:
Put some meat
on those bones.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.939
Hey. Hi.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.242
I thought everybody
was getting dressed up today.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.810
We were supposed to;
there was a memo.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.478
I didn't bring anything
to change into.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.579
Neither did I.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.914
Yeah, but you're
still a nurse.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.482
You should have called me.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.518
What, and then I would be
the only one in costume?

02:30.551 --> 02:31.552
I don't think so.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.820
Frank, where's your costume?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.322
I don't observe
pagan holidays

02:34.355 --> 02:35.456
that celebrate
devil worship.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.358
Well, this
is only for Satanists.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.730
It's kind of working
for you.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.332
( chuckling ):
Shut up.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.799
If you give me an order
and I think it's wrong

02:45.833 --> 02:47.401
I'm going to ask you
to clarify it.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.669
Not in front
of the patients.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.937
I only questioned
the dosage.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.472
You've made mistakes
in the past.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.606
I have not.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.242
CARTER:
Is there a problem here?

02:54.242 --> 02:55.376
Yeah, you've got no guts.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.477
I'm not working
with him.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.611
Why?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.280
Because he treats nurses
like idiots.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.381
KOVAC:
If your boots fit...

03:00.414 --> 03:01.349
Shoes.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.883
Whatever.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.885
Are you wearing that
for your shift?

03:04.918 --> 03:06.720
Yes. It's Halloween.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.522
You know, Jerry
sent out a memo.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.623
Ooh, Naughty Nurse.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.924
Not a Naughty Nurse.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.360
I like it.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.961
It's an old-
fashioned nurse.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.463
Looks naughty to me.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.431
So, you're what,
like a kurva nurse?

03:17.465 --> 03:18.799
What's that?

03:18.832 --> 03:19.900
How do you say,
a slut?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.469
You know,
like a tramp, a whore...

03:21.502 --> 03:22.736
Yeah, I got it.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.805
You know, maybe
I should have worn

03:24.838 --> 03:27.275
that schoolgirl
outfit you bought me.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.910
( chuckling )

03:29.943 --> 03:31.945
She's making a joke.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.416
Cautery.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.651
Robert, what
are you doing?

03:37.685 --> 03:40.454
A laparoscopic
cholecystectomy.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.455
But you can't be.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.556
I had no choice.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.292
This poor swine
is full of stones.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.893
Oh, for heaven's sake.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.497
I hope you're
not expecting
me to scrub in.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.664
No, just giving my
right hand a workout.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.799
It's been five months.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.900
I got to keep
my skills up.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.602
Stapler. Though, even
with one arm

03:54.635 --> 03:56.570
I'm a better surgeon
than the rest of the hacks

03:56.604 --> 03:57.971
in this hospital.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.673
Robert, you're not cleared
to do surgery

03:59.707 --> 04:01.309
even on barn animals.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.444
Were you aware that Weaver
put through a proposal

04:03.477 --> 04:04.412
to hire P.A.s to cover

04:04.445 --> 04:07.581
afternoon rounds

04:07.615 --> 04:09.317
Yes; I thought it
was a very good idea.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.684
That's not the point.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.320
The point is,
nobody talked to me about it

04:12.353 --> 04:13.721
and last time I checked,
I was still head

04:13.754 --> 04:15.323
of both surgery
and this hospital.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.857
The Residency
Review Committee...

04:16.890 --> 04:18.358
Oh, sweet Mary
and Joseph

04:18.392 --> 04:19.459
will you look
at the size

04:19.493 --> 04:21.394
of that gallbladder?!

04:24.798 --> 04:26.800
Look, I know Weaver's
been forming alliances

04:26.834 --> 04:29.470
with some of the
tribal elders while
I was recuperating

04:29.503 --> 04:31.505
but I would have expected
a little more loyalty
from you, Lizzie.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.474
Just rewrite the
proposal as if it
were generated from us

04:33.507 --> 04:35.976
and keep me abreast
of any other covert
Weaver ops, okay?

04:36.009 --> 04:38.479
The last thing I
need is Mata Hari

04:38.512 --> 04:39.513
leading a
palace coup.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.748
What the hell?!

04:40.781 --> 04:41.782
He's extubated.

04:41.815 --> 04:42.916
Get him back under!

04:42.950 --> 04:44.051
100 of brevitol!

04:44.084 --> 04:45.719
Hold him down!
Lizzie, hold him down!

04:45.753 --> 04:46.754
Bloody hell!

04:46.787 --> 04:47.888
He's a pig!

04:49.000 --> 04:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:43.176 --> 05:45.045
90 degrees-- that's good.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.014
It's not my elbow
I'm worried about.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.517
What the hell is going
on down there? Brenda!

05:49.550 --> 05:50.751
All right,
the wrist.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.123
And flex.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.925
Keep going.

05:57.958 --> 05:58.926
A little bit more.

05:58.959 --> 05:59.927
Ten degrees.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.961
Wrong.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.996
Check it again.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.436
Ten.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.738
It was 15 last week.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.506
Fluctuations
are normal, Robert.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.174
With this type
of injury

06:14.207 --> 06:16.109
you've got to
give yourself

06:16.143 --> 06:17.678
at least nine months.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.613
How does this affect my odds?

06:19.647 --> 06:21.882
You've still got
a long way to go.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.451
Yeah, I know. The odds.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.553
For full flexion,
extension

06:25.586 --> 06:28.456
and opposition
of the digits-- 20%.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.758
But even then, without radial
and ulnar deviation

06:30.791 --> 06:34.462
of the thumb, I'm
not sure you'll be
able to operate.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.964
But you can still
be Chief of Staff.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.132
Most of your job
is administrative anyway.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.836
Thanks for the pep talk there,
Marty.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.638
( door shuts )

06:50.143 --> 06:51.579
Excuse me.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.713
I'm looking for Dr. Corday.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.114
ROMANO:
Aren't we all?

06:54.147 --> 06:55.516
Are you a bill
collector
or a suitor?

06:55.549 --> 06:56.717
Med student.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.618
You must be
a slow learner.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.019
It's a career change.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.654
Cowboy and fireman
didn't work out, huh?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.790
I'm supposed to start
my surgical rotation today.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.891
I'm Paul Nathan.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.192
Dr. Romano.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.163
What happened?

07:10.197 --> 07:11.765
Tennis elbow.
Ah.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.501
HARMS:
Jane Doe, 80% surface area.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.201
Gave ten of morphine I.M.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.202
How you doing?

07:15.235 --> 07:17.170
Not... good.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.006
What's your name?
Amy.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.608
Last name?
There was a fire

07:20.641 --> 07:21.609
at the party downstairs.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.843
What's
your last name?

07:22.876 --> 07:23.744
Was anybody with her?

07:23.777 --> 07:24.778
Hard to say.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.614
There was a lot
of confusion.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.849
LOCKHART:
Soot in the nostrils
and intraoral burns.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.551
I'm going to need
an intubation tray.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.085
Get Corday
on that crushed pelvis.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.153
Excuse me.
Not right now.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.655
Ed Jemena, 35.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.824
Full thickness burns
to the hands and forearms.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.725
This guy was on fire.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.259
I tried to put him out

07:39.292 --> 07:41.529
but I didn't have anything
to use but my hands.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.229
Luka, can you
get this?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.531
Yeah. What's open?

07:43.564 --> 07:44.565
Curtain two.

07:44.598 --> 07:45.733
I need a trauma room.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.934
You're lucky
to get a bed.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.068
Okay, yes?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.202
Oh, Paul Nathan.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.203
Radiology?
No, um, surgery.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.238
Resident?
Med student.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.840
Okay, good enough.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.542
Cellulitis to the leg
after a bug bite to the ankle.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.110
What do I do?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.979
Nice catch.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.047
Whoa, we're full
in here.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.014
What do you have?

08:01.048 --> 08:02.550
Doctor,
excuse me!

08:02.583 --> 08:04.151
You all need to stay
in your assigned spots.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.853
If a doctor or a nurse
can't find you

08:05.886 --> 08:07.921
it's going to cause
a delay in your treatment.

08:07.955 --> 08:10.591
Doctor, Doctor, can you tell me
what's happened to my things?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.059
My apartment's
on the fourth floor.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.694
I'll see what I can find out
for you.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.795
And the fire
was on two.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.963
Will they let us go home?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.264
Check with the fire department.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.199
Did they say
how it started?

08:19.232 --> 08:20.000
I'm sorry, I don't know.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.669
Carter, we need you!

08:21.702 --> 08:24.572
The fruits upstairs
were smoking dope, that's what.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.574
No one was smoking
anything, all right?

08:26.607 --> 08:29.943
What's that for?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.645
It's to keep an eye
on the infection.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.280
And what are they giving him
to stop it?

08:33.313 --> 08:34.815
Uh, excuse me.
Unasyn.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.583
And that will get rid
of the infection?

08:36.616 --> 08:37.250
Well, it should.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.619
It's an antibiotic.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.220
Hey, are you a doctor?
Med student.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.255
I need that mayo stand.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.957
Put it under his arm.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.192
Got this?

08:45.225 --> 08:47.294
I'm supposed to be...
Good.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.296
What are you going to do?

08:49.329 --> 08:51.632
We're going to
make you better.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.266
Why can't I
feel my hands?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.936
Uh, the burns have
damaged your nerves.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.270
Is it permanent?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.307
I don't know.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.675
Where's Terry?

09:01.709 --> 09:02.743
Who's Terry?

09:02.776 --> 09:03.877
My partner.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.012
He's dressed like a jungle girl.

09:05.045 --> 09:05.879
Etomidate's
on board.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.214
I need to see Terry.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.316
Trauma panel, ABG
and carboxyhemoglobin.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.083
Prime a line
of ringers.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.752
What is this?

09:11.785 --> 09:13.253
CORDAY:
Rubber mask
melted to the face.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.323
I can barely
open the mouth.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.791
Better try fiberoptic.
Got the subclavian.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.359
I thought you left, Lizzie.
Me, too.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.261
I'm supposed
to be trick-or-treating.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.663
A little old for that,
don't you think?

09:22.696 --> 09:24.765
Open a crike tray
just in case.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.066
Guide wire's passing well.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.768
Preload an eight-
oh tube on a scope.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.237
Pulse ox
down to 85.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.705
15 blade.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.141
JARVIK:
I need a different
light source.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.245
Don't open the tray
unless the intubation fails.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.379
We don't want this... oh!

09:39.412 --> 09:42.115
I'm sorry, sorry.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.383
Got the line.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.652
Run the first
liter wide open.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.819
Robert, are
you okay?

09:45.853 --> 09:46.787
Oh silk, neosporin

09:46.820 --> 09:48.121
and opsite.
Robert?

09:48.155 --> 09:51.291
I'm okay.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.359
Keep bagging on 15 liters.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.661
Get the sats above 90.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.128
If you've got this, Lizzie

09:55.162 --> 09:57.765
I'm going to go check
on the rest of the kids.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.199
CHEN:
Take slow,
deep breaths.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.333
MAN:
I'm trying.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.135
CHEN:
Have you ever
had asthma?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.170
No.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.337
What's this?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.006
Smoke inhalation
with wheezing.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.207
Increased breath sounds?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.009
On the right;
possible pneumothorax.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.143
May need a chest tube.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.378
Vitals?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.980
I've got it.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.247
Yeah, I'm
sure you do.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.017
Get a chest x ray
and show it to me.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.887
Digital escarotomy.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.657
Yeah. He needs the same
on the left.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.726
I agree.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.233
How old do you think she is?

10:33.266 --> 10:35.302
Uh...

10:41.341 --> 10:43.376
Young.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.145
Hey, Dr. Corday?

10:45.178 --> 10:47.347
Yeah?
What have you got?

10:47.380 --> 10:51.184
Urine 60 an hour,
but it's bloody.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.253
80% burns, she's going
to need 12 liters

10:53.286 --> 10:54.755
in the first
eight hours.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.189
Okay, send her
for C.T. abdomen and pelvis.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.758
I still need
to do an airway.

10:57.791 --> 10:58.726
Dr. Corday?

10:58.759 --> 10:59.459
Yes?

10:59.492 --> 11:00.994
Oh, uh, I'm Paul Nathan.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.395
I was supposed to begin

11:02.429 --> 11:04.464
my surgical
rotation with
you today.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.366
Yes, you were.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.301
She's got a critical patient
next door.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.738
Oh. Where should I put these?

11:10.771 --> 11:11.972
Here. Put them right there.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.473
CARTER:
No free fluid.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.843
Liver and spleen
look okay.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.044
Scope is prepped.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.212
Standing by
with the number five shiley.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.280
Rounds started
at 7:00 A.M.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.782
I know; I was...

11:21.815 --> 11:23.150
Not interested in
excuses, thank you.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.484
Did you get my letter?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.954
Dr. Corday,
your nanny is on the phone.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.189
For God's sake,
Frank, take a
look around.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.123
Take a message.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.391
She said to remind you

11:31.424 --> 11:33.060
she has a flight to catch
at 10:30.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.427
Well, I can't leave now,
can I?

11:34.461 --> 11:35.829
What do you want me to tell her?

11:35.863 --> 11:37.330
Tell her to bring Ella here.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.832
Day care's closed,
you know.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.033
I know.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.068
Pulse ox 81.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.202
He's throwing P.V.C.s.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.203
We should crike him.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.504
Is there anything I can do?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.873
Yes. Be quiet.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.341
Okay, bag him.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.177
You really want
to make up for it

11:50.210 --> 11:52.145
go out there and work
up some patients.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.947
Yeah, but shouldn't I...?

11:53.981 --> 11:55.148
You want to
be a doctor?

11:55.182 --> 11:58.919
Yes, but...
Then grab a patient

11:58.952 --> 12:00.453
WOMAN:
I told Martin 100 times

12:00.487 --> 12:03.223
you need to put new batteries
in the smoke detector.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.958
No, no.

12:04.992 --> 12:08.128
God forbid he should spend $3
on a nine-volt.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.031
The whole building
could have burned down.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.499
Um, his x
rays are back.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.067
Oh, okay, good.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.468
How's he doing?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.270
Better than most by
the looks of things.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.405
Yeah.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.040
Okay, next time
I go hiking

12:20.073 --> 12:21.341
I'm wearing
long pants.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.409
And bug repellent.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.377
Your infection's
spreading.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.313
Uh, is everything okay?

12:26.346 --> 12:27.547
I'll be right back.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.882
Excuse me, you're a surgeon?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.450
That's the rumor.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.519
Uh, I think there's something
here you should see.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.354
You're a student-- you haven't
learned to think yet.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.990
I've got a rapidly
spreading cellulitis.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.125
Excuse me.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.426
How rapid?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.428
Well, I just drew
this 20 minutes ago.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.462
( whistles )

12:42.495 --> 12:43.530
And look.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.998
This looks
like sub-q air

12:45.032 --> 12:46.433
consistent with neck fash.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.201
Yeah, nice catch.
Let's roll.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.336
We got to take your
boyfriend upstairs.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.004
Upstairs?
Yeah, to surgery.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.072
What's he on?
Three grams
of Unasyn.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.540
Okay, switch it

12:53.573 --> 12:55.843
to six million units
of Pen G and 900 of clinda.

12:55.876 --> 12:56.977
Where's he going?

12:57.010 --> 12:58.111
Newbie caught a neck fash.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.046
What?
What's that mean?

12:59.079 --> 13:00.280
Your boyfriend may have

13:00.313 --> 13:01.849
what we call
necrotizing fasciitis.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.051
It's a virulent
skin infection.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.418
But they gave him
antibiotics.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.854
The infection's
spreading too fast.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.221
So, what
are you going to do?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.857
We're going to take
you up to the O.R.

13:09.857 --> 13:10.891
and remove the
infected tissue.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.192
What?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.961
All right, everybody
off the elevator!

13:13.994 --> 13:15.162
Take the stairs;
you'll live longer.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.329
If we don't stop this

13:16.363 --> 13:17.965
it will continue
to move along

13:17.998 --> 13:19.599
and you will develop an
overwhelming infection

13:19.632 --> 13:21.368
which will lower
your blood pressure.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.271
You could die.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.339
Oh, my God.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.243
Think I caught that in time?

13:30.277 --> 13:31.511
I hope so.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.479
Thank you.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.014
I'm Susan Lewis.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.448
Paul Nathan.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.884
You coming?

13:36.884 --> 13:39.219
In a minute, yeah.
You okay?

13:39.252 --> 13:40.553
Yeah, it's just

13:40.587 --> 13:43.390
it takes me a moment
to get going sometimes.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.893
Uh... I have
Parkinson's Disease.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.601
I'll be up in five minutes,
Robert.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.036
You said that ten minutes ago!

13:56.069 --> 13:57.204
I'm with a critical patient.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.505
Find somebody else now, Lizzie!

13:58.538 --> 14:00.640
Good E.T. placement.
No infiltrates.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.410
Check ABG, repeat CBC,
and work on a burn unit bed.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.544
What about him?

14:04.577 --> 14:06.413
Who?
Him.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.016
Yeah, what about him?

14:10.283 --> 14:12.485
Pardon me.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.355
I found his CPK, lytes
and UA results.

14:15.388 --> 14:19.159
You headed up to surgery
on the "neck fash"?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.228
Yes, as a matter of fact.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.997
Okay, well...
I guess we're done here.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.333
I am. You still
owe eight hours.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.235
I'm on rounds
at 6:00 a.m.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.470
Welcome to surgery.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.443
( grunts )

14:36.476 --> 14:38.245
Excuse me.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.380
Uh, where can I find somebody
who was brought in?

14:40.413 --> 14:41.949
Admit.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.084
Come here.
Follow me.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.418
Who you looking for?

14:45.452 --> 14:47.320
Wynn Mathison.
He's in a tiger costume.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.957
There was a fire...
Excuse me,
could you please direct me

14:49.957 --> 14:51.024
to the victims
of the fire?

14:51.058 --> 14:51.624
Keep your habit
on, my man.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.960
Excuse me?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.127
Dr. Pratt?
You'll get to be

14:54.161 --> 14:55.562
with your drag queen friends
soon enough.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.430
I have food and housing vouchers
for the displaced.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.066
Oh, I-I'm sorry,
Sister.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.200
Can someone please tell
me what room he's in?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.534
Dr. Pratt?
What?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.536
He's with the guy
in the tiger suit.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.072
( sighs )

15:05.105 --> 15:06.974
Can we get some oil
of wintergreen in here?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.042
I hate the smell
of rotting flesh.
Suction.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.011
Especially when it's
increasing by the minute.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.413
Come on, that bacteria's
moving faster than
you are, Edson.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.714
Bovie.
Systolic's down to 95.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.984
Bolus 500.
Lap pad.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.685
Still not bleeding.
Myonecrosis.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.987
Yeah, it's in the muscle.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.488
Ten blade.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.190
Okay, if it's vascularized,
don't cut it.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.357
That's my plan.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.393
Start there
and carry the incision

15:26.426 --> 15:27.560
four centimeters inferior.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.996
No, that's eight.
Damn it!

15:29.029 --> 15:29.997
We need clean borders.

15:29.997 --> 15:30.697
Where the hell is Corday?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.165
She's in the scrub room.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.600
If I don't
remove enough tissue

15:33.633 --> 15:35.202
the infection could be
left to smolder inside.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.170
Get her the hell in here!

15:37.204 --> 15:39.006
Maybe she can debride this guy's
wound without using a chainsaw.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.073
Hey!

15:40.107 --> 15:41.174
Chris, it's me,
Elizabeth.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.375
Listen,
you needn't come here.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.743
I shouldn't be longer
than an hour.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.744
Dr. Corday, he's
asking for you.

15:44.777 --> 15:49.549
Be right there.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.051
to finish packing?

15:51.084 --> 15:53.386
Yeah, I could pick you both up
after work.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.255
I could drive you
to the airport--

15:55.288 --> 15:57.024
save you the cost of cab fare.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.092
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.527
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.430
Corazon, uh, would you mind
taking the phone?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.232
Not at all.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.466
( metal clinking )

16:06.499 --> 16:08.468
Oh...

16:08.501 --> 16:10.537
Damn.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.339
Was that
your wedding ring?

16:12.372 --> 16:15.442
Yep. Yep.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.145
I can't see it.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.679
Can you call Engineering?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.248
They're closed
till morning.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.249
I'm sorry.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.716
It's not your fault.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.619
Don't hate me.
He wants to talk.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.787
Lizzie, get your ass in here!

16:27.820 --> 16:29.389
I've lost
my wedding ring.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.691
Oh, boo-hoo, this guy's about
to lose a leg!

16:31.724 --> 16:34.527
I'd say chop-chop, but that
would be in extremely bad taste.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.595
Can you call someone

16:35.628 --> 16:37.597
get them
to tape this off for me?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.499
Make sure no more water
is run down it?

16:39.532 --> 16:40.667
Sure.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.335
Would somebody please call

16:42.369 --> 16:43.703
Tiffany's
Search and Rescue Team?!

16:43.736 --> 16:46.206
I'm coming!

16:46.239 --> 16:48.708
He's got 20% surface area burns,
mainly upper body.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.809
Oh, God.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.078
Decent prognosis.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.579
We provide
ventilatory support

16:52.612 --> 16:54.081
until the lungs heal.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.448
Then we extubate him.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.450
Might take a week,
maybe less.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.186
What-what about his face?

16:59.219 --> 17:00.487
He'll need skin grafts.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.090
There'll definitely be
some scarring.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.092
( sobbing )

17:05.092 --> 17:07.627
Wynn. Wynn, it's me, Terry.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.195
I'm right here.

17:09.229 --> 17:13.500
He can't hear you.
He's sedated.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.768
You should probably have
your eye looked at.

17:15.801 --> 17:18.505
Later, okay?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.108
Can I touch him?

17:21.108 --> 17:22.709
I wouldn't.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.813
Yo, newbie.
Come on.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.552
Check jungle perv's eye
with the slit-lamp.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.853
He may have
a corneal burn.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.322
Where's that?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.389
You still here?

17:36.423 --> 17:38.358
Yeah, uh, slit-lamp.
Where is it?

17:38.391 --> 17:39.592
How does it work?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.561
Exam Three. Try
the on/off switch.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.730
Hey, hey.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.565
You changed.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.600
What? I just put on
some scrub pants.

17:47.634 --> 17:48.468
Oh, come on.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.736
You know, Carter

17:49.769 --> 17:51.704
my outfit is really starting
to bug me, too.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.207
But we agreed to stay
in costume the entire shift.

17:54.241 --> 17:54.807
Yeah, I am.

17:54.841 --> 17:55.775
No, you're not.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.244
It's half a costume.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.311
It's always, like,
50% commitment.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.846
Are you serious
or you kidding?

17:59.879 --> 18:01.648
Do you even know what I've been
dealing with down here?

18:01.681 --> 18:02.715
Look, me, too.
In pumps.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.883
Want to see
the whole costume?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.185
No.
Here's the whole costume.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.653
Forget it.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.388
I'm a skeleton!
Look at me!
( growling )

18:08.421 --> 18:09.522
Carter really likes
Halloween, huh?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.258
Perpetual erection.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.892
Accidentally drank
his daughter's
mandrake smoothie.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.694
Police found him
chasing women down the street.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.463
Where do you want him?
In a cold
shower.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.464
Curtain Three's open.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.531
Okay, get
a line in

18:18.565 --> 18:19.532
and push four
of Ativan.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.168
Are you open, baby?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.435
( lecherous laughter )

18:22.469 --> 18:23.403
Perfect.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.172
Whoo!
( laughing )

18:25.172 --> 18:27.707
First day labs, charcoal
and a Foley for the tox screen.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.642
Release me!
I'm the Marquis De Sade!

18:29.676 --> 18:32.579
How am I supposed to pass
a catheter through that?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.713
Inject phenylephrine.

18:33.746 --> 18:34.914
Into the shaft?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.516
I'm Rod Stewart!

18:36.549 --> 18:38.385
He won't hold still long enough
for a blood draw

18:38.418 --> 18:39.419
much less
let me touch his penis.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.853
Oh, she can touch it!

18:40.887 --> 18:42.789
Or we can wait for the
mandrake to metabolize.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.192
Why not just give him Haldol,
make it easier on everybody?

18:45.192 --> 18:46.526
It might make
his symptoms worse.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.894
Hey!
Hey, hey.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.262
He just grabbed
my ass.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.297
Well, I couldn't reach hers.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.764
I said four of Ativan.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.900
Ask Abby.
I'm done.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.537
Okay, you could be a
little bit more sensitive.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.905
To what?

18:58.938 --> 19:00.507
( laughing )

19:00.540 --> 19:01.774
* Choo-choo-choo,
choo, choo *

19:01.808 --> 19:03.576
* Choo-choo,
choo-choo-choo-choo... *

19:03.610 --> 19:06.213
CORDAY:
It's amazing how
quickly this spreads.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.580
EDSON:
Any idea how
he got it?

19:07.614 --> 19:09.782
A cut, a scratch, some
other trivial injury.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.918
Dopamine's at ten mikes.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.286
Need more suction.

19:13.320 --> 19:13.853
Scalpel.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.588
Easy, Lizzie.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.424
Is it just me, or
is this constant
commentary

19:17.457 --> 19:18.258
rather
distracting?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.726
It's not you.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.694
Just remove the
infected tissue
and let antibiotics

19:21.728 --> 19:23.496
and Hyperbaric Oxygen
Therapy do the rest.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.431
You're not serious.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.898
Hell, yes, I am serious.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.400
I'm already into
the posterior compartment.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.401
It's still necrotic soup.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.669
Six hours in
the chamber

19:29.702 --> 19:31.271
will increase
his oxygen saturation

19:31.304 --> 19:33.240
create a bacteriocidal effect...

19:33.240 --> 19:36.309
Robert...
...and give this guy
a chance of a functioning leg.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.578
Do you two have a
problem with that?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.580
How's a guy with Parkinson's
get into med school?

19:40.613 --> 19:42.415
Probably some kind
of disability quota

19:42.449 --> 19:43.250
they have to fill.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.384
Forget med school.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.752
How's he expect
to practice?

19:45.785 --> 19:47.554
Wouldn't want him
taking out my appendix.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.921
He seems to have
it under control.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.657
You know,
it's a progressive disease.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.625
What's he going to be
like in ten years?

19:52.659 --> 19:53.593
Could be dead.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.328
Or want to be.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.397
Happy Abby, always
looking on the
bright side.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.965
Dr. Weaver, I thought
you were out sick.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.501
I was until an apartment fire
set us back 30 patients.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.869
PRATT:
35, if you count
the bad popcorn balls.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.304
Oh, wonderful.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.672
Thanks for
coming in,
Kerry.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.507
Yeah, I shouldn't
have answered my phone.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.675
Want your messages?
No!

20:08.708 --> 20:09.676
I want
the air conditioning on!

20:09.709 --> 20:10.677
I'm sweating like a pig!

20:10.710 --> 20:12.412
It's freezing in here.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.447
That's what you get for
bringing Weaver in on Halloween.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.982
It's the biggest holiday
of the year for her kind.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.684
Lesbians?
Wiccan.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.819
She's probably riding that
crutch around like a broom.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.721
Oh, come on, Frank.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.856
All women get like that
when they're going
through the change.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.292
Pratt!

20:25.325 --> 20:26.359
What? She's having
hot flashes.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.394
She's moody...

20:27.427 --> 20:29.529
That is so sexist.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.463
And stupid.
She's too young.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.398
Early onset.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.599
You've got early onset.

20:32.632 --> 20:33.966
Whatever you say,
Nasty Ratched.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.602
( sighs )

20:35.635 --> 20:37.003
It's nurse, okay?

20:37.036 --> 20:38.938
Not Nasty, not Naughty,
not Wet, certainly not Head.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.607
Just nurse.
( laughs )

20:40.640 --> 20:43.410
Abby, you're going to
talk to Kovac, right?

20:43.443 --> 20:44.544
Yes.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.845
County General
on Bravo One.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.714
I finished
with the slit-lamp.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.682
I numbed him
with alcaine.

20:49.716 --> 20:50.450
Who are you?

20:50.483 --> 20:51.618
Meet Nathan--

20:51.651 --> 20:53.420
our newest oldest
med student.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.954
I'm on surgical rotations

20:54.987 --> 20:56.656
with Dr. Corday.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.459
We have to clear trauma.
BOA with newborn hypoxia.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.827
She asked that I stay
and assist in any...

21:00.860 --> 21:02.329
Good. Follow me.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.631
Don't worry.
She doesn't bite.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.865
Much.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.602
Simone Phipps, 42.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.671
Had a home birth,
newborn in respiratory distress.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.872
WEAVER:
Simone, did you have

21:12.905 --> 21:14.341
a difficult or
complicated labor?

21:14.341 --> 21:15.742
No, it went well.
I didn't even tear.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.844
One minute Apgar with seven,
but he had a little...

21:17.877 --> 21:19.045
Who are you?
I'm the midwife.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.580
What's wrong with him?

21:20.613 --> 21:21.681
We're going to
find out, all right?

21:21.714 --> 21:22.482
Take him to Trauma One.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.483
Wh-Where is that?

21:23.516 --> 21:24.817
LOCKHART:
I'll take him.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.653
No, I... it's okay.
I got it, I got it.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.422
I got it.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.990
Simone, you've lost
a lot of blood.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.825
Something's wrong
with my baby,
I know it.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.461
Lily, stirrups.
Gallant, labs.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.529
Oh, maybe I should have
had him in a hospital.

21:36.563 --> 21:37.530
Simone,
you did everything right.

21:37.564 --> 21:38.831
GALLANT:
CBC, PT/PTT

21:38.865 --> 21:40.633
DIC screen, type and cross
for four units.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.002
We're taking
care of your baby.
Let's help you now.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.404
BP is 80/60.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.672
Okay, squeeze in
another two liters.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.440
What's happening?

21:47.474 --> 21:49.542
You're losing a lot of blood
from a retained placenta.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.777
No, I mean with my baby.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.679
Dr. Kovac is taking
good care of your son.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.914
I'm going to pull gently
on the umbilical cord.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.517
Simone?

21:57.550 --> 21:58.818
I need you to stay with me.

21:58.851 --> 21:59.986
Oh...

22:01.754 --> 22:04.524
Pulse ox is 82.
He's retracting.

22:04.557 --> 22:08.928
Pedes intubation tray,
number three ET uncuffed.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.630
What do you hear?

22:10.663 --> 22:11.931
Wet crackles throughout.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.501
KOVAC:
Fluid in the alveoli.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.469
Okay, let's have a look.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.073
Unhook the bag
from the mask.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.875
You can bag the ET
once I'm in.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.043
I've never done that.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.778
Squeeze the bag
every two seconds

22:25.812 --> 22:27.747
just like he was doing.

22:27.780 --> 22:31.017
Never pass the tube
till you see the cords.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.689
Okay. I'm in.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.092
Call for a pedes vent

22:40.126 --> 22:42.495
and set me up
for an umbilical line.

22:42.529 --> 22:48.034
Relax. Relax, the
hard part's over.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.772
Good.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.876
Notify the NICU team.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.445
What do I tell them is wrong?

22:58.478 --> 23:02.048
I have no idea.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.783
CORDAY:
It's no good.
We're into the quads.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.117
EDSON:
We'll have
to do an AKA.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.819
Keep debriding.
We're not there yet.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.621
If we treat this
conservatively,
and it spreads

23:08.655 --> 23:09.956
we're committed to
a hip disarticulation

23:09.989 --> 23:11.057
to stay ahead
of the bacteria.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.158
It's worth the risk.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.826
Of his being
nonambulatory?

23:13.860 --> 23:15.094
With an above-the-knee
amputation

23:15.127 --> 23:16.463
at least he can
use a prosthetic.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.697
And if it gets
into his hip

23:17.730 --> 23:18.665
it'll spread to
the abdominal wall

23:18.698 --> 23:19.866
and he'll get septic.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.900
I am trying to save
this man's leg.

23:20.933 --> 23:21.768
Dry the field.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.135
What about his life?

23:23.169 --> 23:24.771
He's young.
It's the same thing.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.473
Oh, come on, Robert,
of course it's not.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.740
CORDAY:
Look, this kelly

23:27.774 --> 23:29.909
slices through sub-Q
fat like butter.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.979
All right, fine, keep cutting
until you hit viable muscle.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.515
It's above the distal
third of the thigh.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.750
It's a hopeless wound.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.524
Fine, take it.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.658
CORDAY:
Robert...

23:45.692 --> 23:46.693
I said take the leg.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.495
( slams equipment )

23:50.863 --> 23:52.532
Bovie, pickups.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.639
( man and boy laughing )

23:59.672 --> 24:00.640
Tommy.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.074
How are you feeling?

24:02.108 --> 24:05.878
He seems, he seems
a lot better, thanks.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.146
Good. Well, uh

24:07.179 --> 24:08.815
Just keep him
on clear fluids tonight

24:08.848 --> 24:09.849
and I'll have
a nurse

24:09.882 --> 24:11.017
sign you out.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.184
Okay. Thanks.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.220
What's wrong
with him?

24:14.253 --> 24:16.088
Shhh, shhh....

24:32.138 --> 24:35.107
How you holding up?

24:35.141 --> 24:37.844
I'm good. Uh, I think
the robot can go home.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.246
Okay. I'll get Carter
to dispo him.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.614
Okay.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.117
Can I get you a cup of
coffee or something?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.819
No, fine, thank you.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.722
Uh, I like your outfit.
Mm-hmm?

24:49.756 --> 24:51.090
It's very retro.

24:51.123 --> 24:57.163
( chuckles ):
Thank you.

24:57.196 --> 25:01.267
Um, listen, if you
ever need anything...

25:01.300 --> 25:02.735
Like a straitjacket?

25:02.769 --> 25:04.904
( both chuckling )

25:08.007 --> 25:11.277
Is your... dyskinesia
usually this bad?

25:11.310 --> 25:13.312
I don't want to freeze up
when I'm at work

25:13.345 --> 25:15.882
so I up the medication,
and this is what you get.

25:15.915 --> 25:19.719
At least it helps
to dispel the myth.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.253
You know, we don't all
have rhythm.

25:21.287 --> 25:24.891
( both chuckling )

25:24.924 --> 25:26.225
If that happened to me

25:26.258 --> 25:27.259
I'd probably jump
on a world cruise

25:27.293 --> 25:29.161
not go to Med
school.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.130
I already saw the world.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.099
In fact, I was in Italy
when I first realized

25:33.132 --> 25:34.667
I had a problem.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.003
I was sipping wine in this
little cafe in Florence

25:37.036 --> 25:39.772
and I noticed that my little
finger was shaking.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.041
I just figured
it was from living

25:42.074 --> 25:43.776
on espresso
and martinis.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.945
How did you find
out it wasn't?

25:45.978 --> 25:47.814
Well, I used
to hate doctors

25:47.847 --> 25:50.617
so it took a while
for me to check it out

25:50.617 --> 25:54.220
but, once I did, it really put
things in perspective.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.323
Yeah, I guess being
sick does that.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.158
Her baby's not
doing well, huh?

25:59.191 --> 26:02.228
No.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.362
How you doing,
Simone?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.698
Good. He seems better, huh?

26:05.732 --> 26:06.833
Maintenance fluids

26:06.866 --> 26:09.001
are at 5cc's
per kilo per hour.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.670
My mother had me at home.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.139
I thought it would
be good for him.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.642
Um, his tests
came back.

26:15.642 --> 26:21.247
I'm afraid your baby has a
disease called sialidosis.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.148
What's that?

26:27.987 --> 26:30.890
His body lacks
an enzyme

26:30.923 --> 26:33.392
that breaks down
the waste proteins
inside the cells

26:33.425 --> 26:36.829
and there is already
extensive damage
to the liver

26:36.863 --> 26:39.265
the bones and the
nervous system.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.873
( sighs )

26:46.906 --> 26:50.677
I've been staring at him
for over an hour now

26:50.710 --> 26:53.145
and I still...

26:53.179 --> 26:55.948
can't figure out
what I want to call him.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.387
Would you
excuse us, please?

27:04.791 --> 27:06.292
Uh, yeah. Sure.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.228
( Kovac sighs )

27:13.833 --> 27:17.269
Children with, uh, sialidosis
are mentally retarded

27:17.303 --> 27:20.239
often blind.

27:20.272 --> 27:23.175
He'll never
speak or walk.

27:23.209 --> 27:26.245
His life expectancy
is less than two years.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.348
MAN:
Dr. Kovac

27:29.381 --> 27:30.817
NICU's on line one.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.052
Thanks.

27:34.721 --> 27:36.288
( sighs )

27:36.322 --> 27:37.189
Excuse me.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.373
Is there anyone
you'd like me to call?

27:54.406 --> 27:56.342
( shudders )

27:56.375 --> 28:01.047
( quietly ):
No. There's just us.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.285
I don't think it
will be necessary.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.955
Thank you.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.289
You having a bad night?

28:10.322 --> 28:11.791
No worse than usual.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.760
That was a little bit
insensitive

28:13.793 --> 28:15.327
don't you think?

28:15.361 --> 28:17.396
Hey, I had to tell
a mother her baby
was going to die.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.031
I didn't need an
audience, okay?

28:19.065 --> 28:21.467
Okay.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.402
I'm starting to get some
complaints about you.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.470
From patients?

28:24.503 --> 28:27.406
Nurses.

28:27.439 --> 28:30.276
Don't look so
concerned about it.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.343
Okay, first you accused
Chuny of being an idiot

28:31.377 --> 28:33.412
and then later

28:33.445 --> 28:35.381
when she was sexually
harassed by a patient....
Sexually harassed?!

28:35.414 --> 28:36.816
The guy grabbed
her butt!

28:36.849 --> 28:38.317
Yeah, that's
sexual harassment, Luka.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.319
Oh, come on, Abby,
you were there.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.789
The guy's intoxicated
with mandrake;
he's harmless.

28:42.822 --> 28:43.790
This one's all yours.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.224
What patient?
McFadden.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.392
I was checking his vitals
and he grabbed my boob.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.494
Okay, what's
his status?

28:48.527 --> 28:50.329
He's going to die if he tries
that again; that's his status.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.197
See, every time a nurse
has a problem

28:51.230 --> 28:52.832
she complains to me.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.300
Everyone complains,
it's part of the job.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.069
Yes, and it's part
of my job as Nurse Manager

28:57.103 --> 28:59.305
to counsel you.
What?

28:59.338 --> 29:02.374
You can give nurses orders;
you cannot critique their work.
( groans )

29:02.408 --> 29:03.275
If you have a problem
with a nurse

29:03.309 --> 29:04.844
you have
to come to me.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.512
Okay, what about you?
Who do I complain to

29:06.545 --> 29:07.914
if I have a problem
with you?

29:07.947 --> 29:09.281
Well, here's an idea--

29:09.315 --> 29:10.850
maybe you should
try fighting for the nurses

29:10.883 --> 29:12.384
instead of fighting
with them.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.487
Hey, maybe you
should sew some
swastikas on that costume.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.523
You could be a naughty
Nazi nurse, huh?

29:20.026 --> 29:21.160
You totally suck, you know that?

29:21.193 --> 29:22.361
Hey, careful!

29:22.394 --> 29:24.831
Creating a hostile work
environment!

29:24.864 --> 29:25.932
Where's
Dr. Kovac?

29:25.965 --> 29:27.299
I don't know; page him.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.502
The baby with sialidosis
is febrile to 102.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.071
Chuny, where's Kovac?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.205
Don't know, don't care.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.540
He feels like
he's on fire.

29:34.573 --> 29:35.942
Why hasn't he gone
up to the NICU?

29:35.975 --> 29:36.943
You'd have to ask
Dr. Kovac.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.010
Can you do
something for him?

29:38.044 --> 29:40.346
He needs to be pan-cultured.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.347
How much does he weigh?

29:41.380 --> 29:43.249
3 kilos.

29:43.282 --> 29:48.454
Okay, 150 milligrams
I.V. piggyback of
Cefotaxime and Amp.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.856
Set up for a spinal tap.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.357
He has sialidosis.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.293
Yeah, and he also
has an infection;
60 migs of Tylenol.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.095
I'll make arrangements
for your baby

29:56.128 --> 29:57.897
to be sent up to
the neonatal unit.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.531
We're going to do
everything we
can for him.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.867
Thank you.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.878
Why are you
still here?

30:11.911 --> 30:14.080
Uh, my piano recital
was canceled.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.547
Hey, it's me,
Elizabeth.

30:15.581 --> 30:18.217
I'm on my way home now;
I'll see you soon. Bye.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.924
We did
the right thing.

30:24.957 --> 30:28.094
Trying to convince
me or you?

30:28.127 --> 30:30.262
Look, I went through
a period of adjustment

30:30.296 --> 30:33.332
when I became a mother;
every time I had
to treat a child.

30:33.365 --> 30:34.200
You get over it.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.367
Oh, please, spare me

30:35.401 --> 30:37.369
the two-dollar
psychoanalysis, Lizzie.

30:37.403 --> 30:40.472
Fine.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.174
Hey, look, look, look...

30:46.578 --> 30:48.280
I know most people don't like
me; I don't care.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.548
I don't like most people.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.421
But I'm good at what I do.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.425
I save people's lives.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.527
Every day.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.463
People who no one else can help.

31:10.202 --> 31:15.007
If I can't do that...

31:29.055 --> 31:36.428
Robert... I know
you're frustrated.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.165
You're an excellent surgeon,
and you will be again

31:39.198 --> 31:40.166
I promise you.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.968
You will be.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.476
I'm being paged.

31:50.509 --> 31:51.510
Elizabeth?

31:51.543 --> 31:54.246
Uh...

31:54.280 --> 31:56.115
I'm being paged.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.117
( door closes )

32:04.756 --> 32:06.025
Elizabeth.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.060
I-I just tried
calling you.

32:08.094 --> 32:09.395
I'm sorry, I couldn't wait.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.063
I have to leave for
the airport now.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.264
Well, what about
a later flight?

32:12.298 --> 32:13.499
This is the later
flight.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.566
I threw her pajamas,
some crackers

32:14.600 --> 32:16.035
a couple toys
in here

32:16.068 --> 32:17.003
just in case she had
to stay for awhile.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.470
I'm sorry.

32:18.504 --> 32:19.505
No, no, no,
it's all right,
it's my fault.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.540
We got slammed.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.275
I'm back Sunday night,
so I'll see you
Sunday morning.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.276
Yeah, yeah.
Have a safe flight.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.577
Bye, Ella.
Bye.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.479
Hey, did Chris take you
trick-or-treating?

32:27.513 --> 32:29.415
( alarms sounding )

32:29.448 --> 32:30.482
What is it?

32:30.516 --> 32:32.518
Dropped her pressure
to 60 palp.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.752
Dopamine is up,
we've got two liters going

32:33.785 --> 32:35.487
and I'm working on
an art line.

32:35.521 --> 32:36.755
Any word from her
family yet?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.424
No, we still don't have
a last name.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.426
Lily, could you?
Oh, sure.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.495
There, it's okay.
Hello, little
cowgirl.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.165
I'll be with you
soon, all right?

32:46.198 --> 32:47.566
Could it be hemorrhagic?

32:47.599 --> 32:50.136
CT was negative; I'm
thinking hypoxia.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.304
If we don't find her family soon

32:52.338 --> 32:53.639
they're just going to
be ID-ing the body.

32:53.672 --> 32:54.640
Her pulse ox is only 82

32:54.673 --> 32:56.175
on 100%.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.609
She needs suctioning, Abby.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.445
Set up ultrasound;
she may have thrown a clot.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.047
I don't know, second
crit was only 32.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.381
I still want four units
of type specific.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.749
What happened
to Mom?
In the washroom.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.784
Where are the suction catheters?

33:05.817 --> 33:07.053
Try the cabinet.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.387
What are you doing?

33:08.420 --> 33:10.356
Weaver ordered
antibiotics.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.557
No. Who did the LP?

33:11.590 --> 33:14.060
She wanted a full
septic workup.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.327
This is my patient.

33:15.361 --> 33:16.728
The baby spiked
a fever.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.797
This baby is in a chronic
vegetative state.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.068
You are prolonging his suffering
and the suffering of the mother.

33:22.068 --> 33:22.801
We still treat
kids like this.

33:22.834 --> 33:23.769
You should have asked me.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.804
We couldn't
find you.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.606
I told you to leave
once already; this
is not your case.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.608
Luka.
CORDAY:
Abby!

33:29.641 --> 33:31.077
KOVAC:
You need to check with me before
you push meds on my patients.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.744
I have to do
a cut-down here.

33:32.778 --> 33:36.248
Morrison's pouch looks dry,
but it could be retroperitoneal.

33:36.282 --> 33:37.783
What the hell was
all that about?

33:37.816 --> 33:39.385
You want PEEP on the vent?

33:39.418 --> 33:41.220
Not until we get
her pressure up.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.655
CARTER:
Nathan, why do you
think she's hypotensive?

33:43.689 --> 33:44.423
Blood loss?

33:44.456 --> 33:45.657
Not in this case.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.594
Hypoxia can cause
myocardial dysfunction.

33:48.627 --> 33:49.695
That's it; I'm filing a
grievance against him.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.163
Not now, Chuny.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.332
IV's dry; she needs
a fresh one.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.500
I'll get it.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.601
Panic value

33:55.634 --> 33:56.635
potassium's 8.2.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.537
Damn it, that's rhabdo

33:58.570 --> 34:00.306
from the crush injury;
10cc's of calcium
gluconate.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.673
PVC's.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.842
Let's push bicarb;
ten units of regular insulin

34:03.875 --> 34:05.644
an amp of D-50.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.713
Get me kayexelate and call
renal; she may need dialysis.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.415
( gasps )

34:09.447 --> 34:11.449
What the hell are
you doing?

34:11.483 --> 34:12.717
I accidentally...

34:12.751 --> 34:14.652
It's okay.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.722
Go see if Frank's found
the girl's family.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.123
No, I'll start another one.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.358
Line's in,
is the transducer ready?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.626
Where's the saline?

34:20.659 --> 34:21.627
I said, go find
the girl's family.

34:21.659 --> 34:22.494
Run of five.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.661
100 of Lidocaine

34:23.695 --> 34:25.431
prep the groin
for a quinton catheter.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.465
Sats are falling, 79.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.734
Pressure's down to 50.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.137
Being a little hard on him,
don't you think?

34:31.137 --> 34:32.170
V-tac, charge to 200.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.672
What are you talking about?

34:33.705 --> 34:35.706
Nathan, he's doing a pretty
good job, considering.

34:35.741 --> 34:36.708
Considering what?

34:36.742 --> 34:38.344
He has Parkinson's.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.545
Excuse me?

34:43.849 --> 34:44.815
CORDAY:
Clear.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.185
Still V-tach.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.753
Procainamide's
on board.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.420
Stand by with amiodarone.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.523
Clear.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.393
No change.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.562
How long?

34:56.594 --> 34:57.763
How long?

34:57.796 --> 34:59.431
Uh... 12 minutes.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.700
Clear.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.371
Sinus tach.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.638
All right.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.174
Way to go.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.841
Good femoral pulse.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.711
Set up a pronestyl
drip, then a repeat K.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.514
Labs on your baby.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.250
( sarcastically ):
Thank you.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.186
Glad to see you
two have made up.

35:20.186 --> 35:21.320
Hey, I'm being professional.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.921
She's the one
having trouble.

35:22.954 --> 35:23.889
I warned her.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.891
Warned her about what?

35:25.924 --> 35:29.361
( sighs ):
Nothing.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.863
( laughs ):
Oh, my God.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.301
You're such a jerk.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.468
What?

35:36.502 --> 35:37.703
You slept with her?

35:37.736 --> 35:39.605
( scoffs )

35:39.638 --> 35:41.207
That's what this
is all about.

35:41.207 --> 35:41.907
What's your problem?

35:41.940 --> 35:42.941
One time.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.643
One time.
One time with Chuny

35:44.676 --> 35:46.878
one time with a patient's mother
in radiology.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.448
Hey, you never
complained.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.949
Yeah, I never let it
affect my work.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.284
You two need to figure
this out.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.552
So, what do you

35:53.585 --> 35:54.386
want me to do?

35:54.420 --> 35:55.754
I don't know.

35:55.787 --> 35:57.323
Tell her you're sorry.
Tell her it was wrong.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.391
Just fix it.
I'm not going to kiss her ass.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.260
That's how this whole
problem started.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.861
Have them check a gas on 50%.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.564
I'm going to wait
right here for you, Wynn.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.966
Don't worry
about anything.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.601
I love you.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.237
( sighs heavily )

36:11.237 --> 36:13.639
I should've told them
I was his brother.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.241
ICU has strict rules.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.843
He'll need around-the-clock
attention tonight

36:17.876 --> 36:20.946
but his lungs
are rebounding.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.550
You know what,
you should probably go home.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.352
They'll let you see him
in the morning.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.786
Home?

36:27.819 --> 36:31.257
Our whole lives were
in that apartment.

36:31.257 --> 36:31.957
This dress

36:31.990 --> 36:34.260
is all I have.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.969
I've been watching
his heart rate.

36:44.002 --> 36:50.709
It goes down when I touch him,
when he knows I'm here.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.678
Has his fever gone down?

36:52.711 --> 36:55.914
A little.

36:57.749 --> 37:01.387
I waited so long for him.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.988
Five years.

37:03.021 --> 37:06.292
Two miscarriages,
in vitro.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.859
I lost two boyfriends

37:07.893 --> 37:11.730
because I was so determined
to have a child.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.999
I was about to give up...

37:14.032 --> 37:19.004
and then suddenly...
he was here.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.672
He's here.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.641
We'll keep treating
the infection

37:22.674 --> 37:25.477
but he could start going
into organ failure soon.

37:25.511 --> 37:29.748
His systems
will shut down.

37:32.451 --> 37:37.323
( quietly ):
You're so beautiful.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.024
You're my baby.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.893
His heart could stop beating.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.330
I need to know
what you want to do

37:44.330 --> 37:46.565
if something like
that happens.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.800
I don't know.

37:48.834 --> 37:53.004
To keep him alive,
I may have to open his chest.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.941
Maybe even
shock him.

37:55.974 --> 38:00.011
And I'm not sure you want me
to do something like that.

38:00.045 --> 38:04.750
No...

38:04.783 --> 38:08.620
( quietly ):
I... I don't know.

38:08.654 --> 38:12.057
I don't know.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.025
Tell the unit I flushed
the quintin.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.461
He's tenacious.

38:15.494 --> 38:16.695
You've got to give
him that.

38:16.728 --> 38:17.796
I wish he'd told me.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.999
Kind of a hard thing
to lead with.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.970
Oh, there's Mommy.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.005
There's Mommy.

38:27.038 --> 38:30.509
Hi, uh, Lily had to run
Wynn's ABG up to the lab.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.610
Thank you.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.078
Did you reverse
her hyperkalemia?

38:33.111 --> 38:34.880
Yeah, just enough to
get her to dialysis.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.415
She still has
the burns, though.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.016
Yeah,
but you got her back.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.018
May I?
Oh, I'm sorry, yeah.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.520
Hey.
Thank you.

38:41.553 --> 38:44.423
So, did we reach
the parents?

38:44.456 --> 38:46.625
No, uh, the girl
was actually baby-sitting.

38:46.658 --> 38:47.859
Wasn't even her building.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.528
You know, you might
have told me sooner

38:49.561 --> 38:50.662
saved me some
embarrassment.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.063
About your condition.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.600
Well, I certainly didn't mean
to embarrass you.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.001
How long has it been?

38:56.034 --> 38:58.670
Eight years.
I was misdiagnosed
for the first two.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.672
And you were late
today because...?

39:00.706 --> 39:02.408
My neurologist wanted
an MRI.

39:03.409 --> 39:06.111
I'm sorry.

39:06.144 --> 39:09.648
I wouldn't have
made you stay...

39:09.681 --> 39:11.049
What the hell, fresh start.

39:11.082 --> 39:13.485
Try to make as many
rounds as you can

39:13.519 --> 39:14.920
complete the
required reading

39:14.953 --> 39:16.555
take the exam.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.057
I've been reading
and taking tests for two years.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.892
This is my hands-on
training.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.428
It's a surgical rotation.

39:22.428 --> 39:23.094
I understand that.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.696
Probably the most

39:24.730 --> 39:27.499
physically demanding,
emotionally exhausting

39:27.533 --> 39:31.803
stressful six weeks
any would-be physician
ever experiences.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.539
Part of becoming
a doctor.

39:33.572 --> 39:36.141
I'm offering you
a pass, Mr. Nathan.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.043
Trust me, you should take it.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.078
I'm here to treat patients.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.748
You have a degenerative
neurologic disease.

39:42.781 --> 39:43.882
I know what I have.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.917
It doesn't mean I need a pass.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.686
FRANK:
E.R.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.921
I don't want special treatment.

39:49.955 --> 39:53.091
I just want to learn
like other students.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.794
You're not like other students.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.195
No, I'm older and smarter.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.931
FRANK:
Burn Unit needs you.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.200
I'm on my way out, Frank.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.603
It's your melted mask guy.

40:04.636 --> 40:08.607
Okay. I'll
be right there.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.809
Look, go home,
think about it.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.144
Report back day
after tomorrow.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.646
I'm sure you could
use the rest.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.814
I'm fine.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.883
It's just not
very practical.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.786
Okay, let's go.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.559
Dr. Weaver?

40:27.593 --> 40:30.862
What?

40:30.896 --> 40:31.830
What time is it?

40:31.863 --> 40:32.631
Are you okay?

40:32.664 --> 40:34.600
Yeah, yeah, I was...

40:34.633 --> 40:37.068
( sighing ):
I was just going to
lay down for a second.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.470
Can you pronounce
a patient?

40:38.504 --> 40:40.171
Did we ever hear
back from the NICU?

40:40.205 --> 40:42.007
Uh, no, there was no need.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.008
Oh, come on.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.576
It's been three hours.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.877
We can't board their patients.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.879
They have to call in a nurse
from home

40:47.913 --> 40:50.882
or if they won't,
I want to speak to
their medical director.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.184
Dr. Weaver...

40:53.218 --> 40:57.255
Cardiac arrest
half hour ago.

40:57.288 --> 41:01.059
Excuse us.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.728
You should've come
to get me.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.663
How long did Dr. Kovac
work on him?

41:04.696 --> 41:06.197
He didn't.
She signed a DNR.

41:06.231 --> 41:07.533
Where is he?

41:07.533 --> 41:08.967
Who?
Kovac.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.869
He's home. His
shift ended at 10:00.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.539
All right, I'm going to move her
to a quiet room.

41:13.572 --> 41:14.740
Call the social worker

41:14.773 --> 41:17.676
get her referrals
for grief counseling.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.144
Are you leaving soon?

41:19.177 --> 41:21.547
I'm just, uh,
finishing up with Woody here.

41:21.547 --> 41:24.650
You're the most
beautiful nurse
in this hospital.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.184
Well, thank you.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.986
You've got class.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.889
May I play with
your breasts?
Hey!

41:30.922 --> 41:31.690
Excuse me.

41:31.723 --> 41:32.991
Please?

41:33.024 --> 41:34.926
Last request of a
man on his deathbed.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.995
You're not dying, Woody--
you're drunk.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.196
I want to go
to heaven

41:38.229 --> 41:40.098
on the bosom of
a beautiful woman.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.167
I don't think your HMO
covers that.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.269
How much longer you
have that outfit for?

41:44.302 --> 41:46.037
Tomorrow at noon, why?

41:46.071 --> 41:47.639
Thought maybe I
could talk you

41:47.673 --> 41:49.240
into giving me
a sponge bath.

41:49.274 --> 41:50.609
What's in it for me,
Boney Boy?

41:50.642 --> 41:52.210
Oh, I'll give
you a bone

41:52.243 --> 41:54.112
nasty naughty
little nurse.
( laughing )

41:54.145 --> 41:56.848
ROMANO:
Elizabeth!

41:56.882 --> 41:58.884
Uh... Robert,
can we talk tomorrow?

41:58.917 --> 42:00.752
I really have
to get Ella home.

42:00.786 --> 42:04.189
I thought you might want this
before you left.

42:05.624 --> 42:06.625
It's my ring.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.226
Amazing what you can do

42:08.259 --> 42:11.229
with a laparoscopic camera
and a snare.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.264
Thank you.

42:13.298 --> 42:15.266
De nada.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.937
Uh... look,
about, uh, about today...

42:18.970 --> 42:20.271
Uh, let's not.

42:20.305 --> 42:21.973
It was a momentary

42:22.007 --> 42:23.274
weakness on my part.

42:23.308 --> 42:25.777
It won't happen again.

42:25.811 --> 42:28.847
You'll work through
this, Robert.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.950
Of course I will.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.785
Good night.

42:33.819 --> 42:35.186
Night.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.234
CORDAY:
The patient has gastroenteritis

43:56.267 --> 43:58.236
vomits to excess,
has hematemesis

43:58.269 --> 43:59.337
no history of PUD.

43:59.370 --> 44:02.273
What are you thinking?

44:03.875 --> 44:07.378
NATHAN:
Mallory-Weiss tear.

44:07.412 --> 44:08.980
Laceration of the distal
esophagus

44:09.014 --> 44:10.281
results in an upper GI bleed.

44:11.449 --> 44:15.086
You're both correct and tardy.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.287
Sorry.

44:16.321 --> 44:17.889
Don't be sorry,
be punctual.

44:17.923 --> 44:20.792
What if that patient vomits
and develops chest pain?

44:20.826 --> 44:21.993
Boerhaave's syndrome.

44:22.027 --> 44:23.428
Spontaneous rupture
of the esophagus

44:23.461 --> 44:25.130
associated
with retching.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.898
Usually tears
into the left
pleural space.
