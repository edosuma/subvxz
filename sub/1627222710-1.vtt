on the line, and like,

are... us.

with the baseball cards,

- What if he's dead?
- Then--

10:16.746 --> 10:18.748
- So, it's a short.
- It's a short. [laughs]

10:20.968 --> 10:22.578
Goodie!

10:22.709 --> 10:25.363
I don't think there's,
there's enough of a show there

10:25.494 --> 10:27.975
to engage somebody.
Stu: Yet.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.846
- Finding out that he's a guy
that may have killed somebody

10:29.977 --> 10:32.675
is not good enough.
- Is it a yes, is it a no?

10:32.806 --> 10:34.111
Nat: I don't know that
it's a yes.

10:34.242 --> 10:37.724
We're always here to encourage
great, new stories.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.639
We're here, that's our
business, that's what we do.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.510
- Right.
- So, saying no to something

10:41.641 --> 10:43.512
would be silly of us to do,
that's our business,

10:43.643 --> 10:45.165
that's what we do.
- Right. So, it's not a no--

10:45.296 --> 10:47.342
- But we also have to be in
the position to advise you

10:47.472 --> 10:50.693
to say that, let's not go down
the wrong road here,

10:50.824 --> 10:52.608
without doing the proper
research around it,

10:52.739 --> 10:55.306
and without knowing that
it's going to take perhaps,

10:55.437 --> 10:57.482
on the outside, at worst,

10:57.613 --> 10:59.006
a year and a half
to find this guy.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.398
You need to put a timeline
on this.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.096
- Yeah, we have that.
Okay, so how about this -

11:02.226 --> 11:05.273
we have stuff, we'll send you,
as soon as we leave here,

11:05.403 --> 11:07.928
we'll send you the stuff
that we have.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.886
We'll send it to Craig,
and he can distribute.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.933
Uh, just we have a timeline,
a production schedule.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.326
We sort of have an idea.
- Okay.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.502
- Perfect. Thanks, guy.
- Thanks.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.636
- You wanna keep the,
oh, we'll take the pictures.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.379
So, we'll just have to send
them something today.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.903
Let's get outta here.
- It's a hand.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.949
- Alright, you guys can cut.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.907
Nat seemed like he was
really into it, um--

11:31.038 --> 11:33.997
- Like, into it as like
not into it.

11:34.128 --> 11:37.827
- No, I felt like that he was
into it, and uh--

11:37.958 --> 11:39.263
- But, but not really,

11:39.394 --> 11:41.396
like he was probably playing
like he was into it,

11:41.526 --> 11:44.094
but he wasn't, he wasn't--
- Well, either way, you know,

11:44.225 --> 11:45.922
we're waiting at that point,

11:46.053 --> 11:47.184
and that's what you do
in this business.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.317
You hurry up, and you wait.

11:49.447 --> 11:52.624
I think that we should
have the option

11:52.755 --> 11:54.888
to maybe take it elsewhere.
- Yeah.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.411
- I gotta eat,
I gotta, you know.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.413
- No, no, I agree.
- I got-I got bills to pay,

11:58.543 --> 12:00.502
and we got, we gotta--

12:00.632 --> 12:02.373
Maybe we take it somewhere else.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.202
- Mhmm. It's definitely
something to consider.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.685
Mhmm.
- Are you talking to me?

12:09.816 --> 12:11.426
- What?

12:13.080 --> 12:16.170
Yeah. Okay.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.740
- I bet you in this
neighbourhood,

12:20.870 --> 12:22.437
they sell more with no bacon.
- You wanna make a bet?

12:22.567 --> 12:24.134
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.353
- You're telling me in this
neighbourhood,

12:25.483 --> 12:27.181
that you grew up in--
You grew up here.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.051
You said you come here every
Saturday.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.097
- All bacon.
- No bacon.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.794
- All bacon.
- It's a Jewish neighbourhood.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.970
- All bacon.
- No way.
- Absolutely.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.407
- Excuse me, I have a question
about your homestyle burger.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.496
- Yeah?
- Do more people order it,

12:38.627 --> 12:41.195
around this neighbourhood,
with bacon or without bacon?

12:42.587 --> 12:45.112
- Uh, I'd say probably
with bacon.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.635
- With bacon.
[phone rings]

12:46.766 --> 12:48.071
- With bacon?
In this neighbourhood?

12:48.202 --> 12:49.986
- Hold on, sorry. Sorry,
can we just--

12:50.117 --> 12:52.162
One second. Hello?

12:53.990 --> 12:55.818
- What is all this about?

12:55.949 --> 12:58.168
- Oh, we're actually uh,
we're making a movie.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.387
- Oh yeah.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.869
- We have found
the next big name

13:02.999 --> 13:04.784
in true crime.

13:07.395 --> 13:10.180
- What are you looking at?
- They're trying to find this--

13:10.311 --> 13:12.182
- Yeah, we're,
we're shooting this movie,

13:12.313 --> 13:14.054
and yeah, take a look.
We're uh--

13:14.184 --> 13:16.099
[video plays]

13:18.406 --> 13:21.452
- So, we just pitched this
project to a big company,

13:21.583 --> 13:23.367
hoping to be able to go find
this guy.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.239
- Have you ever done anything
like that before?

13:25.369 --> 13:27.197
- No.
- What are you guys doing?

13:27.328 --> 13:29.156
- Uh yeah, I was just showing
them the uh,

13:29.286 --> 13:32.289
you know, the video and--

13:32.420 --> 13:34.509
- Do you wanna know the good
news, or the bad news?

13:35.553 --> 13:37.077
- I mean I want the good news.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.470
- So, that was Breakthrough.
- Yeah?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.301
- Oh, they're gonna order
the show.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.086
- What?! They're gonna order
the show?!

13:46.216 --> 13:49.132
- They order the show!
- Are you serious?

13:49.263 --> 13:51.178
- Yes.
- Are you serious?

13:51.308 --> 13:53.528
- [laughing]
- She's serious?

13:53.658 --> 13:55.182
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

13:55.312 --> 13:57.532
So, Breakthrough Entertainment
picks up the movie.

13:57.662 --> 14:01.188
Um, they brought on
a fantastic broadcaster,

14:01.318 --> 14:03.973
Hollywood Suite,
and uh, you know.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.062
- That was a dream
come true for us.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.716
- I mean, it was.
- Yeah, no Hollywood Suite

14:07.847 --> 14:09.674
is a great, a great
broadcaster, and you know,

14:09.805 --> 14:11.938
they were actually so pumped up
about this project

14:12.068 --> 14:15.071
that they invited us to uh,
the film festival in Toronto,

14:15.202 --> 14:16.638
- That's right.
- ...to uh, you know,

14:16.768 --> 14:19.815
make a big announcement at
their gala in front of uh,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.251
you know, all of our industry
peers.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.774
- Yeah.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.254
Do you have your speech ready,
or no?

14:24.385 --> 14:26.517
- Of course.
No, the sunglasses are good.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.911
Now people might think
you're uh, like...

14:29.042 --> 14:30.913
- Shia LeBeouf?
- Shia LeBeouf.

14:31.044 --> 14:34.438
Shia! Shia, say something
for the camera!

14:34.569 --> 14:36.310
Man: Shia, one photo!
Shia, one photo!

14:36.440 --> 14:38.616
- You guys are actually
ridiculous.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.315
- Perfect.
- Alright guys,

14:41.445 --> 14:43.317
enjoy the festival. Take care.
- Thank you.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.840
- Hey, no problem.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.668
- You guys know where
the King Eddy Hotel is?

14:46.798 --> 14:49.062
[cars whooshing]

14:49.192 --> 14:51.107
[indistinct chatter]

14:51.238 --> 14:52.935
[cameras click]

14:56.069 --> 14:58.201
- I mean, this was pretty much
the biggest moment

14:58.332 --> 15:00.203
of our career together, so far.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.119
Um, you know,
this was absolutely huge.

15:03.250 --> 15:06.079
[indistinct chatter]

15:22.051 --> 15:24.880
David: Thank you,
and welcome to the 9th annual

15:25.011 --> 15:26.795
Hollywood Suite Breakfast.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.972
For our first-time guests here
this morning, welcome,

15:30.103 --> 15:32.627
and in the case of returning
friends, welcome back.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.846
We at Hollywood Suite
are excited

15:34.977 --> 15:37.197
about announcing an exciting
new collaboration

15:37.327 --> 15:39.286
with the guys at 5'7 Films.

15:39.415 --> 15:41.679
We have the filmmakers
in attendance here today.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.681
[applause]

15:44.813 --> 15:46.728
- Please welcome Stu Stone
and Adam Rodness

15:46.858 --> 15:49.252
to say a few words
about their new project.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.472
[applause and cheering]

15:59.436 --> 16:01.308
- [clears throat]
Good morning, everybody.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.397
Uh, thank you -
oh, sorry -

16:04.702 --> 16:07.183
for inviting us here,
this morning.

16:07.314 --> 16:08.489
Love the event.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.752
My name is Adam, this is Stu.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.623
5'7 Films.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.974
He said that, didn't he?

16:15.104 --> 16:17.193
Uh, we're both 5'7,

16:17.324 --> 16:19.979
so that's why we named
the company 5'7 Films.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.328
[silence]

16:23.330 --> 16:25.375
Thank you to uh,
Hollywood Suite.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.508
The last movie we did is
called "Jack of all Trades",

16:27.638 --> 16:30.511
which investigated uh,
baseball cards.

16:30.641 --> 16:33.035
We thought that
the next logical step

16:33.165 --> 16:35.733
would be to investigate
a little bit...

16:36.734 --> 16:38.475
- Murder.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.390
[silence]

16:42.349 --> 16:44.351
Uh, actually we,
our new project,

16:44.481 --> 16:47.310
we are going to be investigating
a potential murderer.

16:47.441 --> 16:50.357
Uh, this is, this is the guy,
right here,

16:50.487 --> 16:52.272
that we are going to be
investigating,

16:52.402 --> 16:54.361
and hopefully finding.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.232
If you happen to see this guy,

16:56.363 --> 16:58.278
definitely do not approach him,

16:58.408 --> 17:01.368
and contact your local
Crime Stoppers,

17:01.498 --> 17:02.673
or us. [chuckles]

17:02.804 --> 17:04.109
[silence]

17:04.240 --> 17:06.068
So, thank you very much again,

17:06.199 --> 17:08.243
and enjoy the rest
of the event. Thank you.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.941
- Thanks, guys.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.291
- Oh, I was--
- Oh, go ahead. Yeah, sure.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.337
- Thank you.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.515
- Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.909
Important project for us.
We know you can deliver.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.565
We've put a lot into this,
so uh, don't mess it up.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.480
I know you won't.

17:26.609 --> 17:28.525
So, turning to other business--

17:28.656 --> 17:30.875
- Uh, something that maybe
people who are movie lovers,

17:31.006 --> 17:33.182
maybe they don't know who,
who are watching this,

17:33.313 --> 17:35.663
is that in order for any movie
to get green lit,

17:35.793 --> 17:37.143
or go, or to shoot,
or to film,

17:37.273 --> 17:39.406
you need to show
that you have insurance.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.277
- But why are you talking
about the insurance?

17:41.408 --> 17:43.279
- Because that's where
we're at in the story.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.108
- I know. The producer
gets the insurance.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.979
You have to go,
you have to find an insurer,

17:48.110 --> 17:49.633
you have to find a medical
doctor,

17:49.764 --> 17:51.679
- In order to get the money.
- I know, but why -

17:51.809 --> 17:53.159
again like just let me
explain it

17:53.289 --> 17:54.986
because you've never done it
before.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.250
This was my idea,
and I had a plan.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.080
- And what brings you in today?

18:01.210 --> 18:03.386
- Uh, we're getting checked up
for uh,

18:03.517 --> 18:05.258
insurance purposes.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.173
- Okay.
- Is this a doctor's office?

18:07.303 --> 18:09.436
- It is.
- But it's a dentist's office.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.307
- Yes.
- Yeah, but it's still a doctor.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.005
- Yeah, still a doctor.
Okay, give me one sec.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.703
Let me go call Dr. Matt.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.618
- Dude, this is a fucking
dentist's office.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.273
- It's a doctor's office, yeah.
- This is a dentist's office.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.405
- Which is a doctor's office.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.494
- Hey buddy, how's it goin'?
- How's it goin'? Not bad.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.540
What's up, buddy?
- Good to see you. Stu.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.890
- We have to get insurance
signed off

18:29.020 --> 18:30.500
and we have to have
a doctor sign off, so--

18:30.631 --> 18:32.372
- But you're a dentist, right?

18:32.502 --> 18:34.374
- Yeah, I could recommend some
doctors for you guys, if--

18:34.504 --> 18:36.811
- Well, no, no, no,
we wanted you to do the--

18:41.903 --> 18:43.644
Matt: Do they care,
if like you know,

18:43.774 --> 18:45.515
my degree is Doctor
of Dental Surgery?

18:45.646 --> 18:47.343
- Doc-- sorry,
just say the first part.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.215
- Doctor. Okay.
- Yeah. That's is.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.130
- Dr. Matt.
- But you are a doctor.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.957
- Yeah, they call me Dr. Matt.
- But they call you,

18:53.088 --> 18:55.525
I mean, is that how it works?
- Yeah, Dr. Matt Grinstein.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.353
You guys saw the name
on the door.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.007
- I saw the name on the door,
but I just--

18:59.138 --> 19:00.530
- Okay, I wanna see you bite
down. Teeth together.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.402
We've got quite a bit.
Just a bit of a margin

19:02.532 --> 19:04.273
from where the crown ends
to where your tooth starts.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.753
[chair whirs]

19:05.883 --> 19:08.147
[indistinct chatter]

19:09.713 --> 19:11.150
[machine beeps]

19:11.280 --> 19:13.064
- That beeping is a good sound?
- Yeah.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.501
[velcro tears]

19:14.631 --> 19:16.807
- So, when I'm checking
my pulse and it's,

19:16.938 --> 19:18.461
and it would be like 120--

19:18.592 --> 19:20.376
- You don't usually check it
over the ear though--

19:20.507 --> 19:22.073
- So, it's like the forearm?

19:22.204 --> 19:24.032
- Yeah, we could do the radial
pulse,

19:24.163 --> 19:25.599
or we can actually
get a pulse up here, so.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.427
- Where's the weirdest place
to check a pulse?

19:27.557 --> 19:29.342
- Honestly, the weirdest
would be your groin.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.344
- Okay.
- Check my pulse?

19:31.474 --> 19:34.260
- No, your groin would be -
it has a strong pulse.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.480
- So, Stu and I have found
a confession tape of um,

19:37.611 --> 19:39.961
what we think is an alleged
murderer.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.006
- I told you about Ted Bundy,

19:42.137 --> 19:44.313
one of the ways they were able
to kind of pinpoint him, right?

19:44.444 --> 19:46.576
- How?
- Forensic odontology.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.535
He bit one of his victims
on the shoulder,

19:48.665 --> 19:50.928
and they actually were able
to take models from the,

19:51.059 --> 19:53.540
the bite marks on his shoulder,
and the poured them up.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.020
They were able to match his
mouth with the bite mark

19:56.151 --> 19:58.458
on the, on the female shoulder,
which is super cool.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.503
- Wait, so look at this guy,
if he bit somebody,

20:00.634 --> 20:01.896
it would be pretty easy
to tell.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.463
- Dude, it looks like he's
missing several teeth,

20:03.593 --> 20:04.942
which is rare.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.683
Do you know what,
this isn't the best picture,

20:06.814 --> 20:08.772
but if he actually has
congenitally missing lateral
incisors,

20:08.903 --> 20:10.774
this puts him down to like
3 or 4 percent of the people.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.560
- So, this is rare; he's rare.
- Yeah, I would say so.

20:13.690 --> 20:16.476
- Uh, we were, we were pretty
excited at this point.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.914
You know, the money hits
our account, you know our,

20:20.044 --> 20:22.221
our shoot is officially
happening,

20:22.351 --> 20:24.353
the investigation
is officially underway.

20:24.484 --> 20:26.312
And the uh,
the first thing you do

20:26.442 --> 20:29.228
when you have an investigation,
you go to the cops.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.666
- You know, thanks so much for
letting us ride along with you.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.494
Obviously, this is incredible.

20:34.624 --> 20:38.062
- We think that the-that
we might've found

20:38.193 --> 20:40.891
the next true crime phenomenon.

20:41.022 --> 20:45.026
What does it take for the
police hop on a case to assist?

20:45.156 --> 20:47.507
- Do you want to show me
that uh, piece?

20:47.637 --> 20:49.770
- I could show you.
- I'll pull up here.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.121
- This is the guy.
He goes by David Stoner,

20:53.252 --> 20:54.601
is what he calls himself.
- Hmm.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.430
- And this is him.
- You gotta know what you're,

20:57.560 --> 20:59.606
what you see,
and what you have,

20:59.736 --> 21:01.999
before you can actually um,

21:03.087 --> 21:05.916
make a decision on it.
And um--

21:06.047 --> 21:08.441
- We don't have enough yet.
- I don't, I don't think so.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.706
- Like you, specifically,
cannot help us?

21:12.836 --> 21:15.448
- Specifically, I couldn't.
- Silky, smooth voice.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.450
It'd be great to have you
on our side.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.191
Constable Wright: At the end
of the day,

21:20.322 --> 21:22.324
what you have right now is,

21:22.455 --> 21:24.892
is a drunken idiot flapping
his gums.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.463
[siren wails]

21:30.593 --> 21:32.726
Stu: So, could we find somebody
to pull over?

21:32.856 --> 21:34.336
Could we scare somebody, like?

21:34.467 --> 21:35.816
Constable Wright: No, no.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.949
- So, the cops wouldn't
work with us.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.561
- No, the cops uh, they had
no interest in helping us.

21:41.691 --> 21:44.215
- I just said that.
- I'm just reiterating it.

21:44.346 --> 21:48.350
- I had to go and like, find
another way to keep it going,

21:48.481 --> 21:50.221
and that was to hire
a private investigator,

21:50.352 --> 21:51.919
so we lined up the best ones
possible.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.616
Stu: How are ya, man?
Brian: Not bad, how are you?

21:53.747 --> 21:55.096
- I'm Stu, nice to meet you.
- Stu?

21:55.226 --> 21:56.576
- Yeah.
- Adam.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.229
I feel like I'm walking
into a trap, here. [laughs]

21:58.360 --> 22:00.449
- It's a trap, man.
So, basically we--

22:00.580 --> 22:02.799
- You good with this?
- What?

22:02.930 --> 22:04.888
- This seat?
Does this look weird?

22:05.019 --> 22:06.673
I feel like I'm higher up
than you.

22:06.803 --> 22:09.110
- Sorry.
- Maybe this one, too?

22:11.025 --> 22:12.722
Is that better?
Man: That's great, actually.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.463
- Is it a comedy show? [laughs]
- No.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.509
- No, I just don't want him
to look like,

22:16.639 --> 22:18.206
it's like we're shooting--

22:18.337 --> 22:20.643
- I mean, I investigate murder
cases all the time.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.123
- Okay.
- Right.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.691
This guy's name is David
Stoner, and he has like a--

22:24.821 --> 22:26.649
- It's a pseudonym?
- I guess so.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.696
- The logical step would be
to see where these videos

22:29.826 --> 22:32.002
were uploaded from.
Can we find an IP address

22:32.133 --> 22:34.353
that would link us to the city
or the country that he's in?

22:34.483 --> 22:36.616
- So, we have about 20 guys
that do nothing

22:36.746 --> 22:38.879
but surveillance.
- Like stakeouts?

22:39.009 --> 22:40.750
- That's what they do.
Yes, all day long.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.012
- I love stakeouts.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.101
- But don't check the Trunk...

22:44.232 --> 22:46.365
don't check the fuckin' burn
barrels. [laughs]

22:48.715 --> 22:50.064
- Where the fuck did Stacy go?

22:50.194 --> 22:52.066
- First thing I see,
is he mentions Stacy.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.547
- Yeah, that's the thing that
we're kind of circling around.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.810
- It's not as easy as you
think. There's a lot of work.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.899
You guys, of course, you're
probably on a light budget,

22:59.029 --> 23:00.596
so we'd want a retainer
up front.

23:00.727 --> 23:01.989
- So, a case like this,

23:02.119 --> 23:04.339
how much would something like
this cost?

23:04.470 --> 23:06.472
- Hundred grand.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.780
Brad: But guys absolutely think

23:10.911 --> 23:13.566
that you might-that this guy
might be real.

23:15.132 --> 23:18.266
And with your empathy,
and humanity,

23:18.397 --> 23:20.790
and all that bullshit,
you wanna put him jail.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.705
- Yeah, that's exactly--

23:22.836 --> 23:24.794
- That's exactly
what we want to do.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.622
- Well, you get points
for that.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.494
David Stoner: What do you like
the most about me, mom?

23:28.624 --> 23:31.671
I did clean my room!
Kiss my grits.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.542
- First of all,
have you been to the cops?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.805
- We've been to the cops, yes.
- And what did they tell you?

23:35.936 --> 23:38.547
- They said that, that we
didn't really have anything.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.897
- Well, ya don't!
What if I don't find him?

23:41.028 --> 23:42.421
[silence]

23:46.947 --> 23:48.688
You look a little deflated.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.777
- Well, I mean I feel like, if
the job was to not find him...

23:50.907 --> 23:52.474
[in unison] We could do that.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.084
- You know, we need to find
somebody that can...

23:54.215 --> 23:55.782
- Actually find him.
- find him.

23:55.912 --> 23:58.654
- Well, I know you need me
to find him, but I might not.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.569
I might not.

24:02.005 --> 24:05.792
- Hey, Mr. Lynn?
- Are you sure this is--

24:05.922 --> 24:08.664
- No we're, we're in the--
- We're in the lot.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.753
- We're in the,
we're in that south lot.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.233
Adam.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.677
- Okay, okay. Sorry. Okay,
okay, just put the camera--

24:21.808 --> 24:24.419
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
- Okay, sir, sir, sir!

24:24.550 --> 24:26.203
- Cut it, cut it.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.205
Adam: Sir, just put
the camera down.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.033
- Didn't somebody tell you that
we were gonna be filming?

24:30.164 --> 24:31.818
- Nobody told me they would
be filming.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.602
Don't you know what I do
for a living, boy?

24:33.733 --> 24:35.865
- The whole point of this was--
- Nobody said they are filming.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.172
And the next thing is,
anything can happen on camera,

24:38.302 --> 24:40.653
you have to pay my rate, plus.
- Okay.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.742
- Alright?
- Yeah, that makes sense.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.178
- So, a bottom line is,

24:44.308 --> 24:46.485
a retainer is gonna take $1,000
more.

24:46.615 --> 24:47.964
- $1,000.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.400
- And things will come true.
What?

24:49.531 --> 24:51.011
- How, how much was the
retainer in the first place?

24:51.141 --> 24:52.926
- Well, I mean, we speak
about a retainer then,

24:53.056 --> 24:54.275
because I'm always flexible

24:54.405 --> 24:56.103
and we didn't know what you
guys got goin' on.

24:56.233 --> 24:58.192
Now that we, now that we
know the situation, right,

24:58.322 --> 25:01.151
it's gonna take at least
$1,000 more. Alright?

25:01.282 --> 25:03.110
Cool, sounds good?
Because I always deliver.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.678
So, show me what you got.
- Okay, this is the guy.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.681
His name is David Stoner,
and this is--

25:08.811 --> 25:10.683
- Let me see this David Stoner.
- This is the guy.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.816
- David Stoner. Ras clot.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.820
And he's from the internet?
- Yes, he's from the internet.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.693
- Kiss my grits. [laughs]

25:22.259 --> 25:24.044
- You guys are too into this,
man.

25:24.174 --> 25:26.699
This is fake news, fake video.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.223
You'd have to convince me
that this is real.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.225
David Stoner: [moans]

25:32.966 --> 25:36.099
- The way I work,
I need to have facts, right?

25:36.230 --> 25:37.927
- Yeah.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.668
- We need to find out
who Stacy is.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.365
Now, get the fuck outta
the car. Alright.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.454
- Okay.
We're not hiring that guy.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.762
- Why, are you scared of him?
- Yes! Very.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.896
Just so you know,
we are so excited,

25:50.026 --> 25:51.767
because you take no shit
from anybody,

25:51.898 --> 25:53.377
and we're gonna catch this guy.

25:53.508 --> 25:56.076
Brad: I like your enthusiasm.
I will catch him.

25:56.206 --> 25:58.818
Just want to talk about like
the um, monetary values

25:58.948 --> 26:00.776
and the compensation.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.736
So, you tell us,
where are we at?

26:05.085 --> 26:08.523
- Well, uh what I'm expecting
is a $30,0000 retainer

26:08.654 --> 26:11.918
online in the next day or so,
and then I'm working for you.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.311
And the balance
when I find him.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.183
- Sorry, 30--

26:16.313 --> 26:19.708
are you saying it's like
30 grand, and less the 25%?

26:20.927 --> 26:23.843
- No, I've already, I've
already taken the discount off.

26:23.973 --> 26:28.195
We're looking at $75,000 total.
I need $30,000 up front.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.980
- Um, it was pretty clear
at that point,

26:31.111 --> 26:34.462
that Adam did not budget
this movie properly.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.812
Um, you know, he didn't take
into account obviously

26:36.943 --> 26:39.467
that the detectives cost money.
Um...

26:41.774 --> 26:44.472
because you know, people wanna
get paid for their work.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.386
So.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.521
- I'm pretty sure that was my
plan the entire time.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.654
- What, be in the hole?
That was your plan?

26:52.785 --> 26:54.917
- Yeah. I got a strategy.
- Huh, you did great.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.832
Either way, it was pretty
obvious who we needed to hire.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.442
- Yeah.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.357
[gunshot blasts]
- Geez. Christ!

27:00.488 --> 27:02.403
What the fuck was that?

27:09.149 --> 27:11.064
- All you gotta do is pay
my rate. Everything goes good.

27:11.194 --> 27:12.805
- Okay. Was that a gunshot?

27:16.373 --> 27:18.071
- You tell me what you know.

27:18.201 --> 27:21.030
- Uh, what we know is this,
we have his online channel

27:21.161 --> 27:24.164
is called "Bait and Tackle
Mondays".

27:24.294 --> 27:26.209
So, we have,
there's a white car.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.907
- A white car.
- There's a dead dog,

27:28.037 --> 27:29.691
I'm sure there's--
- Hold on, hold on a second.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.780
A white car--
- A white car.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.174
- It's a white car.
- Someone named Stacy,

27:34.304 --> 27:35.828
that's the potential victim.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.525
- If this is a potential
victim, did you guys

27:37.656 --> 27:40.049
even try to track to down
any MPRs?

27:40.180 --> 27:41.660
- What's that?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.400
- That's a missing person's
report.

27:43.531 --> 27:45.620
You've gotta check out MPRs
from everywhere.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.709
Could be from this city,
from Newfoundland,

27:47.840 --> 27:49.189
and this is what Richard Lynn
will do.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.669
- And you can do that?

27:50.799 --> 27:52.540
- Oh yeah, we can do that.
I'll tell ya,

27:52.671 --> 27:55.848
that kind of search, add about
$2,800 for a search like that,

27:55.978 --> 27:57.588
because that's a deep search.
- How much?

27:57.719 --> 28:00.069
- $2,800, and that's cheap,
boys.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.158
You know, you know that.
- On top of the 35.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.813
- Of course! Let's go outside
and look at it on the hood.

28:04.944 --> 28:07.076
Come on, okay?
Just be careful of the paint.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.991
- This is, this is,
this is our guy.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.037
- What your dirty fingernails.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.995

Except...

I can get you out of it,

1:29:49.862 --> 1:29:51.864
because Richard Lynn
always delivers.

1:29:51.995 --> 1:29:53.562
But you know,
it's gonna cost you

1:29:53.692 --> 1:29:55.389
three times the amount
this time,

1:29:55.520 --> 1:29:57.740

1:29:57.870 --> 1:29:59.785
You're done.

It's gonna be three times
the rate, alright,

1:30:01.570 --> 1:30:03.267
it's like when you're working
with the government.

1:30:03.398 --> 1:30:05.661
When you work a stat holiday,
right? You get triple time?

1:30:05.791 --> 1:30:08.098
Well, Richard Lynn is gonna
cost you triple time.

1:30:08.228 --> 1:30:10.796
But I'll get you out of it.
Alright?

1:30:10.927 --> 1:30:13.407
I can get you out of it.
Alright?

1:30:16.846 --> 1:30:19.109
- Believe it or not, um,
in the end, we were heroes.

1:30:20.197 --> 1:30:22.504
Yeah, because David Stoner
was a killer.

1:30:22.634 --> 1:30:24.984
Glenn Santos was a killer.
We were right!

1:30:25.115 --> 1:30:26.682
And we were able to get off
on those charges

1:30:26.812 --> 1:30:28.771
because of uh, self defence.

1:30:28.901 --> 1:30:30.860
- But uh,

1:30:30.990 --> 1:30:32.905
you know the pizza guy,

1:30:33.036 --> 1:30:35.038
he, well he died.

1:30:35.168 --> 1:30:36.866
We killed him, so.

1:30:36.996 --> 1:30:39.737
- Yeah. Well,
we definitely killed him.

1:30:39.869 --> 1:30:41.087
- That's on us.

1:30:41.218 --> 1:30:42.915
- But we're working
on that right now.

1:30:43.046 --> 1:30:44.612
We actually have a legal fund
that we're putting together

1:30:44.743 --> 1:30:46.484
to try to fight that case,
and actually.

1:30:46.615 --> 1:30:48.834
- Uh, show them.
- If anyone from uh,

1:30:48.965 --> 1:30:50.706
Ziggi Papers happens
to be watching,

1:30:50.835 --> 1:30:52.184
uh we can, oh,
well, you can have those.

1:30:52.316 --> 1:30:54.361
- Just get me the hell outta
here. Thank you.

1:30:54.492 --> 1:30:56.320
- Are we done is that it?
- Just get me outta here.

1:30:56.451 --> 1:30:58.191
I can't be one more second
with this guy

1:30:58.322 --> 1:30:59.496
or I'm gonna fucking kill
myself.

1:30:59.628 --> 1:31:01.760

to speak to my mom,

1:31:01.891 --> 1:31:03.719

1:31:57.686 --> 1:31:59.688
I figured out

1:32:07.085 --> 1:32:08.871
really, really,
really good.

1:32:09.001 --> 1:32:10.568
But they were too dumb,

1:32:10.699 --> 1:32:12.875
so I figured I could
stay ahead of 'em.

1:32:13.005 --> 1:32:15.138
When they found out
about the car,

1:32:15.268 --> 1:32:17.009
I already knew
about the white car,

1:32:17.139 --> 1:32:18.837
but they left me
with a perfect,

1:32:18.968 --> 1:32:20.925
beautiful,
true crime story,

1:32:21.057 --> 1:32:22.014
which in the end,

1:32:22.145 --> 1:32:23.886
they end up doing it
themselves,

1:32:24.016 --> 1:32:25.757
and now them paying
the price for it.

1:32:25.888 --> 1:32:27.629
- As a film producer, you need,
you need footage.

1:32:27.759 --> 1:32:29.761
So, how did you
get the footage you needed

1:32:29.892 --> 1:32:31.850
in order to produce the film?
How did that happen?

1:32:31.981 --> 1:32:33.460
- Oh, ya see, Gordo,

1:32:33.591 --> 1:32:35.201
ya see when we catch him,
right,

1:32:35.332 --> 1:32:37.073
all me did was go
to his camera guy,

1:32:37.202 --> 1:32:39.728
we paid them,
and we got the footage.

1:32:39.858 --> 1:32:43.035
Simple. Buy cheap,
and we sold high.

1:32:43.166 --> 1:32:45.516
Exactly what a good
producer does.

1:32:45.647 --> 1:32:47.910
And these guys,
they were so dumb,

1:32:48.040 --> 1:32:50.608
they couldn't figure out
what they had going on.

1:32:50.739 --> 1:32:53.655
- What would you say is
their greatest regret?

1:32:53.785 --> 1:32:55.178
- If they would
have paid my rate,

1:32:55.308 --> 1:32:57.267
everything would have
been so much different.

1:32:57.397 --> 1:33:00.749
They'd be big ass movie
producers right now,

1:33:00.879 --> 1:33:02.880
I be in my car,
working another job,

1:33:03.012 --> 1:33:05.797
but instead,
they didn't pay my rate.

1:33:05.928 --> 1:33:07.886
- They're going to jail now.
I've got a list here -

1:33:08.017 --> 1:33:09.627
let's look at some
of the things.

1:33:09.758 --> 1:33:11.760
- So, what you got? Let me see
what kind of stuff been done.

1:33:11.889 --> 1:33:13.544
- Things they spent
money on.

1:33:13.675 --> 1:33:16.068
$7,500 on golf.

1:33:16.199 --> 1:33:18.549
They had a Russian arm
camera rig rental,

1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:21.030
$25,000.
- Ooh, true.

1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:22.509
- But these two nitwits
spent

1:33:22.639 --> 1:33:25.556
$64,000 on
a convertible car.

1:33:26.557 --> 1:33:28.690
They also went
to a dentist,

1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:31.475
they got nitrous oxide
tanks, $1,200.

1:33:31.606 --> 1:33:33.956
They spent $1,100
on smoothies.

1:33:34.085 --> 1:33:35.130
- Cheers!

1:33:35.261 --> 1:33:36.915
- Their most careless,
and quite frankly,

1:33:37.046 --> 1:33:40.005
reckless, item was
a massive house party.

1:33:40.136 --> 1:33:41.224
These guys
are fucking idiots.

1:33:41.353 --> 1:33:43.791
- [laughs]
You said it right, Gordo!

1:33:45.315 --> 1:33:47.056
- Next week On Gord!

1:33:47.186 --> 1:33:48.753
Our coverage of the trial
begins,

1:33:48.884 --> 1:33:50.189
and you too can tune in
for the laughter,

1:33:50.320 --> 1:33:52.061
because will justice
be served hot and fresh,

1:33:52.191 --> 1:33:53.802
or will it die a horrible,

1:33:53.932 --> 1:33:56.326
cold death,
like the poor pizza man?

1:33:56.456 --> 1:33:59.371
We'll find out,
next time On Gord!

1:34:00.896 --> 1:34:02.724
- Yes, Gordo,
that was good, man!

1:34:02.853 --> 1:34:09.513
♪♪♪

1:34:14.736 --> 1:34:17.216
- Or, get Tom in here.
Man: I told Tom.

1:34:28.445 --> 1:34:30.795
- Maybe just like--
Woman: Yeah, I'm gonna go--

1:34:32.754 --> 1:34:34.799
- This guy's always,
always doing a bit.

1:34:34.930 --> 1:34:36.975
- Just get the T-zone.
- The T-zone.

1:34:37.106 --> 1:34:39.674
- [laughs] That is the best
thing I've heard all day.

1:34:41.023 --> 1:34:42.807
- That's not a good
for this shoot.

1:34:42.938 --> 1:34:45.070
If that's the best thing
you've heard today, that's bad.

1:34:45.201 --> 1:34:47.898
- [laughs] I'm kidding.
- The T-zone?

1:34:49.379 --> 1:34:51.686
- It was good for me.
It was a good joke for me.

1:34:51.816 --> 1:34:53.513
- I taught him about-
I taught him about the T-zone.

1:34:53.644 --> 1:34:55.037
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:34:55.166 --> 1:34:56.734
He didn't know about a T-zone.
- He didn't know about--
