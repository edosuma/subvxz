17:27.417 --> 17:28.834
(door opens)

17:28.834 --> 17:30.542
Hi!
Hi.

17:30.542 --> 17:33.291
I didn't realize you were
gonna be here so early.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.125
Yeah, I was
at that morning dance thing.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.500
Did you get
my text about the juice?

17:36.500 --> 17:37.959
Yeah, yeah.
I responded, yes.

17:37.959 --> 17:40.041
I got the green
and the beet.
Oh, right, right, right, sorry.

17:40.041 --> 17:42.542
It's just I'm in--
I'm in a weird headspace.

17:42.542 --> 17:43.667
It was weird?
It was no good?

17:43.667 --> 17:45.000
No, you know what,
it was fine.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.125
It was just, um...
It just wasn't for me.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.166
There was a lot
of touching and hugging

17:49.166 --> 17:51.041
and body glitter,
just too early in the morning.

17:51.041 --> 17:52.792
But I'm over 30,
so what do I know?

17:52.792 --> 17:54.667
Yeah, it's weird. I can't do
anything in the morning.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.000
Like, I can't even
read a book.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.375
Like, anything--

17:57.375 --> 17:58.583
I'm sorry
to cut you off, Jess.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.291
I just-- I was hoping
for a moment of quiet.

18:01.333 --> 18:02.959
Oh, yeah, totally.
Great.

18:02.959 --> 18:03.959
Sorry.

It's my birthday--
Where are we on the settee?

18:21.834 --> 18:23.125
What's a settee?

18:23.125 --> 18:26.000
It's the couch thing
I asked you to order.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.667
Oh. Uh...

18:28.667 --> 18:31.166
Yeah, I will f--
I will find-- I'll find that--

Oh, okay, yeah.

from like,
a sociological perspective.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.458
And I'm totally glad I went--

20:27.458 --> 20:29.458
Yeah, I think they're all
camping out in our yard.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.250
Yes, and our backyard is
full of day ravers.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.500
You will know them
by their trail of glitter.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.625

There's no way those girls

20:36.625 --> 20:38.458
aren't skeeved out by him.

20:38.458 --> 20:42.583
Well, maybe they're not.
I once fucked a guy that was
26 years older than me.

20:42.583 --> 20:43.792
What?!
Wow.

20:43.792 --> 20:44.792
When was this?

20:44.792 --> 20:46.458
It was way before our time.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.875
Don't make it
about you.

20:47.875 --> 20:50.625
I used to go
to Costco when I was a kid.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.667
You really can't
beat the savings.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.834
I mean, they've been selling
a hot dog and a fountain soda

20:55.834 --> 20:57.333
for $1.50
since the '80s.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.583
Come on!
That's right. Those hot dogs
are fucking good.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.667
And they'll let you
return anything.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.208
Anything.
No questions asked.

21:04.208 --> 21:08.708
I returned
an inflatable pool island

21:08.708 --> 21:10.750
that Quinn used
for an entire summer,

21:10.750 --> 21:12.375
they still gave me
my money back.

21:12.375 --> 21:13.959
Bullshit.
Cash.

21:13.959 --> 21:15.166
Cash?
No receipt.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.500
They're fabulous.
That is incredible.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.500
I just can't
give up Costco, man.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.333
I feel so fucking
calm in that place.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.291
(laughs)

21:22.291 --> 21:23.333
Wait. How old is he?

21:23.333 --> 21:24.417
67.
He's 67.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.500
He's 67?

21:25.500 --> 21:27.125
Yeah.
I can't even get
out of the house.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.500
I mean,
I've been trying to see--

21:28.500 --> 21:30.542
I've been trying to take her
to see "Hamilton" forever.

21:30.542 --> 21:32.291
Oh, it is so good.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.500
We totally get it though.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.000
We got key lime pie
in Red Hook the other day,

21:36.000 --> 21:37.875
and it was like
scaling Mount Everest.
I love that place.

21:37.875 --> 21:40.542
The satisfaction we felt,
it was ridiculous.
I haven't been there in so long.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.542
Just getting out of the house.
And I didn't eat anything.

21:42.542 --> 21:45.166
But you know...
honey, we should
just go for strolls.

21:45.166 --> 21:46.458
Just go for a walk.
Oh, right.

21:46.458 --> 21:47.792
Are you fucking
kidding me?

21:47.792 --> 21:49.708
It'd take two hours
to get out the door.
(baby crying)

21:49.708 --> 21:51.041
Okay.
Oh, no, no, I'll get it.

21:51.041 --> 21:52.250
I'll get her.

21:52.250 --> 21:53.708
Okay.

21:53.708 --> 21:54.750
Okay.

21:54.750 --> 21:55.917
(sighs)

21:55.917 --> 21:58.959
So, I saw on Instagram,
Jane is walking.

21:58.959 --> 21:59.959
Yeah.
She is.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.500
What are you guys
doing with her stroller?

22:01.500 --> 22:03.708
So, what you retired
and then you moved to New York?

22:03.708 --> 22:05.417
I don't hear about that
very often.

22:05.417 --> 22:08.166
I mean, I used to be
a fucking asshole, so...

22:08.166 --> 22:09.583
Really?
Oh, yeah.

22:09.583 --> 22:14.708
Yeah, I was working my ass off
for my entire kids' childhood.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.083
It was like, they were born
and I went to work

22:17.083 --> 22:19.291
where I slept
and woke up 30 years later.

22:19.291 --> 22:20.375
Just working?

22:20.375 --> 22:22.917
Yeah, I just...
selling the company, man.

22:24.750 --> 22:27.500
Yeah.
And the idea behind this place,

22:27.500 --> 22:29.083
is to expose the grandkids

22:29.083 --> 22:31.166
to a little culture,
a little diversity...

22:31.166 --> 22:33.417
Okay.
...so they're not
so scared growing up

22:33.417 --> 22:35.250
like Quinn
and her brother were.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.917
You know,
so fucking uptight.

22:36.917 --> 22:40.000
Yeah, her husband's
kind of uptight, too.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.375
Oh, God. Did they call you
about that tick thing?

22:43.375 --> 22:45.625
No.
Oh, baby.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.166
They said they were
gonna call you.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.583
Well, here's
a perfect example.

22:50.583 --> 22:54.417
They got all bent out of shape
after you came last time

22:54.417 --> 22:57.166
because apparently
you threw away a bottle

22:57.166 --> 22:58.542
they were saving
a tick in.

22:58.542 --> 23:04.291
Yes, the tick that bit
the baby in Montauk.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.291
What?

23:06.291 --> 23:08.250
I know people
drafted into Vietnam

23:08.250 --> 23:11.000
who reacted more calmly
than those two about that tick.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.792
That's... terrible.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.458
I took their tick, man.

23:15.458 --> 23:16.792
(laughing)

23:16.792 --> 23:19.417
I've just been watching those
two run around like assholes

23:19.417 --> 23:21.583
for the past week talking
ticks and Lyme disease,

23:21.583 --> 23:23.667
and I'm just thinking
this shit is fucking cray.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.792
Yeah. That is cray.

23:25.792 --> 23:27.417
(phone buzzing)
Wait a minute.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.208
News from the front.

23:32.208 --> 23:34.333
They'll be home
in about 15 minutes or so.

23:34.333 --> 23:38.458
So, it seems like we can
safely smoke that thing.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.417
All right. That sounds good.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.417
I can put the kettle on
and, um...

23:42.417 --> 23:44.667
You want something?
Tea, beer?

23:44.667 --> 23:46.000
Beer would be good.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I'll get some of Dean's
craft beer, some good shit.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.041
No, I don't want
to drink his craft beer.

23:50.041 --> 23:52.208
Oh, I bought it,
it's fine.

23:58.166 --> 23:59.458
Thank you.
Thank you.

23:59.458 --> 24:02.417
Her fingernails
were so dirty.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.500
Did you really
not notice that?
Did I notice that

24:04.500 --> 24:06.500
her fingernails were dirty?
No, I did not see that.
Yes.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.041
Oh, my gosh,
they were filthy.

24:08.041 --> 24:09.708
I can't believe
you didn't notice that.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.500
Well, she's busy.
She works in production.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.792
She has like,
15-hour days.

24:12.792 --> 24:14.291
That is a ridiculous excuse.

24:14.291 --> 24:16.375
Also, she's a lesbian.
Yeah.

24:16.375 --> 24:19.000
So you'd think that would be,
like, extra important to her.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.083
Or to Joan.
Yeah...

24:22.083 --> 24:23.875
And like, I ate her food.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.041
It's not like I think
she's a filthy person.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.917
No, I know.
I just would not want
to be her sex partner with--

24:28.917 --> 24:31.375
Do you smell that?
Is something burning?

24:31.375 --> 24:33.375
Oh, my God, Dad!
Oh!

24:33.375 --> 24:36.750
Dad! Dad!

24:36.750 --> 24:38.875
Do you see
the monitor? Dad!

24:39.917 --> 24:41.208
Oh, what the--
Shit!

24:41.208 --> 24:45.208
Dad, you put the fucking
electric kettle on the stove!

24:45.208 --> 24:46.708
It was burning!

24:48.250 --> 24:51.041
My God!
Are you seriously
holding a joint right now?

24:51.041 --> 24:54.417
Wow. My God,
I'm sorry you guys.

24:54.417 --> 24:56.750
Thank goodness you came home
when you did, right? Shit.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.875
Yeah, otherwise you would've
burned down the whole house.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.291
Well, it's an honest mistake.

25:01.291 --> 25:04.458
I'm used to my stovetop kettle
in there, the same shape.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.542
Was it a mistake
or are you stoned?

25:06.542 --> 25:11.041
Cookie, I'm sorry.

25:11.041 --> 25:12.667
But I've gotta say,

25:12.667 --> 25:15.959
I think the stimulating
conversation's what made me
forget about the kettle,

25:15.959 --> 25:17.542
not the grass.

25:17.542 --> 25:20.250
I just took two hits right now.
Ask him.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.875
Yeah, I saw him.
He only took two hits.

25:22.875 --> 25:24.959
And I heard that
I took your tick,

25:24.959 --> 25:26.625
and I feel terrible.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.041
Totally. I hope
that you guys--

25:33.417 --> 25:34.417
Have a good night.

25:34.417 --> 25:35.792
Sorry about this.
I'm really sorry.

25:35.792 --> 25:37.583
It's cool, man.
I'm sure it was an accident.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.500
Dad, do we have to be
the only adults in the house?

25:40.500 --> 25:42.750
Are you gonna be our other child
that we have to worry about?

25:42.750 --> 25:45.333
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Like Dean said to The Guy,
it was an accident.

25:45.333 --> 25:48.959
Yeah, well, the weed guy's
not helping us raise our
child, you are.

25:48.959 --> 25:52.250
And I know you don't have
a lot of experience
raising children,

25:52.250 --> 25:55.166
but it's more than just
showing up and buying things.

25:55.166 --> 25:58.125
You have to actually
be present and sober, okay?

25:58.125 --> 26:01.083
Not act like some unemployed
20-year-old raver.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.458
What the fuck, Quinn?

26:02.458 --> 26:04.083
Don't put me
on blast like that.

26:04.083 --> 26:05.083
(snickers)

26:05.083 --> 26:07.500
Stop making fun of me!

26:10.083 --> 26:11.959
I'm a person.
I'm not just Dad.

26:11.959 --> 26:13.792
I'm a person too,
and I have feelings.

26:13.792 --> 26:16.375
(smoke alarm beeping)
Yeah, well, now the house
is filled with toxic fumes.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.625
Well, then you can all
sleep down here if you like.
I don't care.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.792
Sorry. We've had
a few too many tonight.

(chuckles)

28:20.583 --> 28:23.083
Wait, I thought your daughter's

28:23.083 --> 28:24.875
You don't know
"Bye, Felicia"?

28:24.875 --> 28:26.750
No. Who's Felicia?

Get ready.
