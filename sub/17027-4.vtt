00:01.369 --> 00:04.705
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.738 --> 00:08.342
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.244
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.278 --> 00:11.712
and by the time I got here,

00:11.745 --> 00:16.084
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.452
I hid who I really was,

00:18.486 --> 00:22.623
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.656 --> 00:26.094
To most people
I'm a reporter
at Catco Worldwide Media.

00:26.127 --> 00:29.530
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.563 --> 00:31.632
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.665 --> 00:34.302
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.669 --> 00:39.073
I am Supergirl.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.674
KARA:
Previously on Supergirl...

00:40.708 --> 00:42.076
Detective Maggie Sawyer...

00:42.110 --> 00:43.244
I think we made
a pretty good team.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.445
Yeah, I guess we did.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.381
ALEX: What the hell
is this place?

00:47.415 --> 00:50.484
Place for off-world'ers
to hang out, have a drink.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.720
-Who are you?
-My name is M'gann M'orzz.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.455
I am the last daughter
of Mars.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.357
HANK HENSHAW: So
our mystery alien
is from Daxam.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.292
It's a sister world
to Krypton.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.228
My name is Mon-El.
Can you help me get in touch
with my home world?

01:00.261 --> 01:02.530
Daxam is still there,
but it's a wasteland.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.140
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

01:16.344 --> 01:18.146
My prince,
you can't stay here.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.449
Come on!

01:32.760 --> 01:34.362
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.165
This is a Kryptonian ship.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.399
The emissaries?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.533
Dead.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.568
And so is their planet.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.471
All of this
is Krypton's doing.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.173
We need to get
you out of here.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.341
I can't fly one of these.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.809
Can you program
the destination?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.211
Yes.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.648
Launch countdown started.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.285
(BEEPING)

01:59.753 --> 02:01.355
No. No!

02:01.389 --> 02:03.291
-You can't...
-You need to save yourself.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.560
For once in your life,
obey me.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.597
Those are my people out there.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.166
(PANTING)

02:13.467 --> 02:15.736
Let me share in their fate.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.341
Beyalat Daxam!

02:22.643 --> 02:24.245
(SHIP STARTING)

02:30.418 --> 02:32.853
So anyway,
that's how that happened.
(GRUNTS)

02:32.886 --> 02:34.255
You were a palace guard?

02:34.288 --> 02:36.257
For the great royal family
of Daxam.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.226
Ugh, they were the worst.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.929
And their son, the prince,
he was rumored to be
the worst of the worst.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.397
Frat boy of the universe.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.766
Uh, he...
He had his good moments, too.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.268
-Hmm.
-Oh, yeah, your planets

02:47.301 --> 02:49.237
didn't get along
so well, did they?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.438
-No.
-No.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.541
Yeah, I know it's a long shot,

02:53.574 --> 02:54.975
but any chance there was
a response

02:55.008 --> 02:56.544
to that signal I sent
to Daxam?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.479
I mean, I can't be
the only one left, right?

03:00.781 --> 03:02.450
I'm sorry, but, no.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.692
Right, uh...

03:11.725 --> 03:14.328
Anyway, enough of those...
Those dreary thoughts, right?

03:14.362 --> 03:15.729
So, what do you guys
do for fun around here?

03:15.763 --> 03:16.964
Do you drink or dance or...

03:16.997 --> 03:18.466
Oh, hey, do they play
Garata here?

03:18.499 --> 03:20.401
-What's Garata?
-It's like soccer,

03:20.434 --> 03:22.703
-with dragons.
-No, not that.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.706
Uh, we have PlayStation.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.476
Great. So, when do we get
out of here and do that...

03:28.509 --> 03:30.344
That thing you just said?

03:30.378 --> 03:32.846
Actually, you have to stay
here in the DEO.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.449
Until we can assess
the full range of your powers,

03:35.483 --> 03:37.351
you're gonna have to stay
in this facility.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.353
For your own protection.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.556
I will do as you ask.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.657
Good.

03:43.691 --> 03:47.295
Now,
I have somewhere I need to be.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.696
Where are you headed?

03:49.363 --> 03:50.664
It's personal.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.835
I didn't know he did
anything personal.

Want to see a dead body?

04:01.675 --> 04:03.544
Homeless guy found it
about an hour ago.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.513
Other cops won't go near it.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.584
Figured it wasn't
a Halloween costume.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.557
Oh, right, I forgot you two
were running buddies.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.327
-Do you know
what species it was?
-He's Syvillian.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.028
He's got months
of scar tissue built up,

04:21.061 --> 04:22.763
heavy bruising
on the knuckles.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.632
He didn't just
go down fighting, he made
a habit of it.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.700
That doesn't make any sense.
Syvillia is a utopia.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.736
It's peaceful.
They don't fight.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.771
-They hardly even argue.
-He could've been
defending himself.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.606
There's no skin
under the fingernails.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.375
No, you're right.
These couldn't have been
defensive wounds.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.709
Maybe he was the aggressor.

04:35.743 --> 04:36.644
Bar brawl gone bad?

04:36.677 --> 04:39.046
Someone accidentally
kills him, panics...

04:39.079 --> 04:40.481
Dumps the body...

04:40.948 --> 04:42.350
Wait a minute.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.654
Oh!

04:46.687 --> 04:49.089
Well, looks like our killer
was alien, too.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.392
Can your super lab
run some tests on that?

04:51.425 --> 04:52.826
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.330
Well, seems like you two
have got a handle.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.532
Maybe you can, uh,
go over this with
your contacts on the streets?

04:58.566 --> 05:00.901
I already made a few calls.
But I'll follow up, though.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.007
You're supposed to be
at the Sanitation Department

05:07.040 --> 05:09.076
getting figures
on pelican deaths
at the trash dump.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.711
I'm so excited about that,

05:10.744 --> 05:14.415
but I just overheard a report
about a murdered alien

05:14.448 --> 05:15.749
on my NCPD scanner.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.552
They're calling it
"alien-on-alien violence."

05:18.586 --> 05:21.589
An alien got killed,
an alien did it.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.957
-Where's the story?
-I...

05:23.991 --> 05:25.693
I just told you the story.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.829
Really?

05:28.862 --> 05:31.599
So you got an actual NCPD
source to speak on the record?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.701
Did you talk
to the victim's family?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.569
Set up an interview
with the D.A.'s office

05:35.603 --> 05:37.771
to see if and when
charges will be filed?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.807
Where's the
medical examiner's report?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.109
Did you research economic
and demographic indicators

05:42.142 --> 05:45.579
to provide some context
for human-alien
race relations?

05:45.613 --> 05:47.114
All very good questions, uh...

05:47.147 --> 05:48.449
You didn't give me a story.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.750
You gave me a half-baked idea.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.352
Go bake it fully,
then I'll talk to you.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.525
Go! Bake, bake, bake!

-J'onn...
-Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I just...

06:36.063 --> 06:38.699
I... I need to hear it.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.035
When the White Martians
attacked, where were you?

06:42.069 --> 06:46.507
I was taken
to the internment camp
near the Galle Crater.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.408
That was the worst of them.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.512
I lost many friends there.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.648
Yeah. Prisoners
penned up like animals.

06:54.682 --> 06:57.918
Barely enough space to move.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.654
Sometimes the guards
would just kill someone
at random.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.523
To set off a panic.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.593
And then watch as green bodies

07:05.626 --> 07:06.827
trampled over each other.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.929
How did you get away?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.064
Um...

07:11.098 --> 07:14.668
One day, a White Martian
broke rank

07:14.702 --> 07:16.704
and refused a kill order.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.972
I've never known
one to show mercy.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.941
Uh, she was...

07:20.974 --> 07:21.875
Different.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.945
She smuggled me off,
helped me off-world.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.947
I never looked back.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.650
That was 300 years ago.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.019
You did what you had to do.
You're a survivor.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.588
I am whatever I have to be
to get by.

07:38.626 --> 07:41.762
I... I've always dreamed
of, uh, finding another.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.733
Now that you're here,
I thought we might

07:47.267 --> 07:48.736
take the bond.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.138
You want to share minds.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.940
Yes. Would you honor me
with that?

07:54.174 --> 07:56.944
I have customers.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.846
Can we talk about this
some other time?

08:09.757 --> 08:11.725
We're gonna need
a bigger block.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.727

08:13.761 --> 08:15.262
No, it... It's just "awesome."

together and you'll be golden.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.134
-Anything on our alien perp?
-Yes, yes.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.772
The thorn found
in the dead body
is from a Brevakk.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.807
Some sort of biological
defense mechanism.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.709
So, yeah, that's new
and terrifying.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.210
Any ideas where
we can find him?

No. But these weren't

but I assure you, I'm fine.

It's a miracle, J'onn.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.220
I met her at that alien bar
you spoke of.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.890
We talked, but...

10:23.691 --> 10:25.693
I think I made a mistake.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.060
Why? What happened?

10:27.094 --> 10:30.698
I offered to merge with her
in the Martian way.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.165
But you guys just met.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.134
Psychically, Kara.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.104
The bond is the traditional
Martian way of communicating.

10:37.137 --> 10:37.938
We...

10:37.971 --> 10:41.041
We link minds,
share dreams, emotions,

10:42.710 --> 10:43.977
memories.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.879
We kept no secrets
from one another.

10:45.913 --> 10:50.017
Imagine a world without ego,
selfishness. Without...

10:51.318 --> 10:53.186
...lies.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.421
That sounds beautiful.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.724
She didn't seem to think so.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.659
The moment I talked about it,
she left.

-Thanks.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.126
I have another idea
for an article

11:33.160 --> 11:36.163

is too keen on it.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.200
Or me, for that matter.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.302

than I thought.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.271

really hard.

Shouldn't you be
testing your abilities
with Winn somewhere?

12:02.122 --> 12:05.993

We could "chillax for five."

So, who is that woman?

12:11.865 --> 12:13.500
It's my mother.
She's not really her.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.770
But she's a hologram of her
with her thoughts
and knowledge.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.907

like this on Daxam.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.224
to come in here
to tell her about my day.

I know it's not really her,
but I...

-Alone.

Well, your mother, I mean.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.776
Oh, okay.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.112
Winn told me that
"babe" is what you call
a beautiful woman on Earth.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.014
I'm sensing
that's not right.

too much about women

You never asked.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.659
Don't give me that.

That's the real reason
why you didn't want
to take the bond.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.830
Because then I'd know how

the DEO received reports
this morning

of a six-foot alien attacking
two men in a bar last night.

The news is so very violent
these days.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.968

had a 5'2" sidekick.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.304

26:45.337 --> 26:47.039

through the city last night.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.741
By some miracle,
nobody is dead.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.844

will recover.

needed to stay here

He meant it wasn't safe

-That's not why
I've been standoffish.

28:31.343 --> 28:32.845
And don't say I haven't been.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.117
My parents gave me so much.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.353

My dad was a scientist
and my mom fought for justice.

28:47.093 --> 28:51.197
They were proud,
strong people.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.133
Good Kryptonians
and even better parents.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.269
And that's the way
I want to remember them.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.505
And why shouldn't you?

28:59.538 --> 29:00.773
Because...

And no matter how smart
they were, or how hard
they tried,

29:08.247 --> 29:09.481
they couldn't save us.

of the world coming,

29:19.158 --> 29:20.860

anything about it.

-No answer.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.348
But Winn traced it.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.150
We found it in the alley
behind the alien bar.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.920
Someone took him in a hurry.
It was clean, fast.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.088
And Megan didn't show up
for her shift today.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.423
It's Roulette. She has them.

-For round two.

-Do we have eyes on Hank?
-SUPERGIRL: No.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.338
-Tonight, that changes.
-(DOOR BUZZING OPEN)

32:53.772 --> 32:57.243
Our gladiators will fight
for the privilege of being

32:57.276 --> 32:59.345
the last Green Martian.

32:59.378 --> 33:02.648
Tonight, they fight
to the death.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.387
I don't fight to the death.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.523
Tonight you do.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.494
-(BUZZES)
-Fight!

33:16.362 --> 33:18.230
Why won't you show yourself?

33:18.264 --> 33:21.067
My true form
is mine to reveal.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.135
You will not take that
from me.

33:24.303 --> 33:27.239
And I will not fight you.

33:27.273 --> 33:28.540
We don't have a choice.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.077
Our choices are all we have.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.319
Only one of us
is walking out of here.

34:13.352 --> 34:16.188
And I told you, I'm whatever
I need to be to survive.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.558
And now you'll be a killer.

34:24.696 --> 34:27.499
There is no shame
in surviving.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.468
I'm not ashamed.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.170
I'm not.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.572
You don't fight for money.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.275
You do it because you think
you deserve it.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.843
For surviving.

34:37.876 --> 34:41.513
But you don't have to punish
yourself anymore, M'gann.

34:42.514 --> 34:43.849
You're forgiven.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.485
We both are.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.898
I won't kill him.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.733
I won't.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.835
Thought it might go down
like this.

SUPERGIRL: Stand down!

35:57.623 --> 35:59.191
Everybody, stand down.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.828
Things are bad. I know.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.830
But fighting amongst
each other?

36:05.864 --> 36:07.933
That's what
they want us to do.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.269
Other aliens
are not the enemy.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.938
She is. And the more we fight
each other,

36:12.971 --> 36:16.408
the more we distract ourselves
from the real problems.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.377
Cadmus, people like Roulette.

36:18.410 --> 36:19.945
They say we're dangerous.

36:19.978 --> 36:21.847
That's what they want
everyone to believe.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.352
Don't let them
be right about us.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.664
You're under arrest.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.300
For what?

36:41.333 --> 36:44.770
For operating without
a liquor license for starters.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.305
I'm sure you've figured
it out by now,

36:46.338 --> 36:48.774
but it's not a good idea
to bet against me.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.850
Hey, I was just
coming to help.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.619
What's going on?

37:00.652 --> 37:02.688
Orders came down from on high.

37:02.721 --> 37:03.889
We have to let her go.

37:05.624 --> 37:06.992
It's all about timing.

37:07.025 --> 37:09.861
Having the right friends
at the right moments.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.797
Your day will come.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.571
Should have planted
something on her.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.273
Sometimes I wish
I wasn't a good cop.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.774
I think you're a great cop.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.744
Are you getting soft on me?

37:25.777 --> 37:27.546
No.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.316
Look, I know in crappy
moments like this,

37:30.349 --> 37:31.917
I could use a drink. So...

37:31.950 --> 37:34.353
What do you say?
First round's on me.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.787
Oh, can't.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.889
Hey, babe.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.828
Next time?

37:44.029 --> 37:46.665
Yes. Next time. Yeah.

(LAUGHS)

37:55.707 --> 37:57.909
You got a minute?
I want to show you my story.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.546
The one about
the fictional fight club
that I rejected twice?

38:00.579 --> 38:02.080
No.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.716
No, it's the one
with the official NCPD
crime report,

38:04.750 --> 38:06.585
forensics from
the M.E.'s office,

38:06.618 --> 38:10.288
and an on-the-record
first person account.

38:13.425 --> 38:14.960
Really?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.328
Who's your source?

38:16.895 --> 38:17.929
Supergirl.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.599
Supergirl.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.300
-Really.
-Yes.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.736
She's... She is...

38:24.770 --> 38:26.572
She's a close personal friend
of mine.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.074
And when I told her
that I wanted

38:29.107 --> 38:30.842
to pursue this story,

38:30.876 --> 38:33.078
er, she wanted to help.
A lot.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.947
So, her and I
spoke at length...

38:35.981 --> 38:39.317
She and I... So, yeah.
It was all on the record.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.855
You're developing sources.
Good.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.091
Your nut graf is too long,

38:46.124 --> 38:47.826
you have multiple
run-on sentences.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.061
You're not using AP style.
Write it again.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.008
Hey.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.479
I heard you took out Draaga.

39:07.513 --> 39:08.714
Yeah.

39:09.615 --> 39:10.849
Thanks for the tip.

39:12.451 --> 39:15.687
Yeah, I thought it would
be fun to have these powers.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.389
It can be.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.157
It will be.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.026
I'm going to teach you how.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.462
I got the impression
that you didn't want
to spend time with me.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.763
Oh, you're right. I didn't.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.034
But I asked the DEO
to release you
into my custody.

39:29.635 --> 39:30.802
Really?

39:33.104 --> 39:35.140
Why?

39:35.173 --> 39:38.877
I wasn't sent to planet Earth
to be a hero.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.779
I was sent to protect
my cousin.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.916
To teach him
and keep him safe.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.052
And I never
got to fulfill that purpose.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.088
So, in a weird way,

39:50.121 --> 39:51.122
helping you,

39:52.958 --> 39:55.393
it gives me another
chance to do that.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.168
Who would have thought?

40:04.202 --> 40:07.105
A boy from Daxam
and a girl from Krypton,

40:07.138 --> 40:08.273
working together.

40:08.306 --> 40:10.942
Why? Is it because you come
from a planet of partyers?

40:10.976 --> 40:13.144
No, because you come
from a planet of snobs.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.801
At least I knocked this time.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.837
Well, I didn't...

40:38.870 --> 40:40.806
I didn't think you would
speak to me again.

40:40.839 --> 40:44.175
It's going to take more than
a steel cage death match
to get rid of me.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.955
I'm sorry.

40:56.988 --> 40:59.124
To be such a disappointment
to you.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.093
Like you said,
the past is over and done.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.996
What matters
is what happens now.

41:07.265 --> 41:10.135
If you don't want to take
the bond, I'm fine with that.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.939
I'm just glad to know you.

41:27.619 --> 41:28.920
I'm around.
