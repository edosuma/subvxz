Jesus! I'll tell you what you do.

- Screw Tommy, man.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.711
Tommy won't like it.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.154
I couldn't keep him out, Paul.

He saw an opportunity and he just pounced.

The unions, trucking,
he's infiltrated every aspect of my business...

<i>(Kersey)</i> No, it wasn't you.

- Yeah. Still teaching architecture.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.639

13:43.120 --> 13:47.159
Ah, yes. You said on the phone

- Olivia Regent.
<i>- (Vasquez)</i> The fashion designer?

13:52.160 --> 13:55.152
- Wasn't she married to?
- Tommy O'Shea.

13:55.280 --> 13:59.751
You see, O'Shea has involved himself
in her business,

13:59.880 --> 14:04.431
in the whole fashion world, in fact,
in a very bad way.

14:04.560 --> 14:08.678
- She would like to get him out.
- Maybe we can help each other.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.998
I haven't been able to touch that guy.
When can she come in?

14:13.120 --> 14:16.829
- Tomorrow?
- Perfect. Tommy O'Shea.

14:16.960 --> 14:22.353

reconstruction, the face will never be the same.

Paul, I didn't know she would need protection

20:23.200 --> 20:25.668
I should have known.

20:47.760 --> 20:52.151
My investigation started an hour ago

Olivia Regent, the victim, is part of an ongoing

- The Tommy O'Shea investigation?
- What do you know about that?

He was at the scene of the crime
and wherever he is, he stinks.

I watched him come up through the Irish gangs.
Now he's going big time. He's a scumbag.

But we believe the perp might have been
somebody else. Do you recognize him?

21:17.000 --> 21:20.151
He had a lot of make-up on. I don't know.

- Do you know him, Vasquez?

- Looks like Frederick Garretty.
<i>- (woman)</i> Aka Freddie Flakes.

21:27.960 --> 21:31.111
He's got a skin condition. It causes bad dandruff.

21:31.240 --> 21:35.552
When O'Shea has a special job to do,
he uses this piece of scum.

21:35.680 --> 21:39.719
Likes disguises, a security freak.
A very lethal guy.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.515
What about Tommy O'Shea? He's the guilty one.

21:43.640 --> 21:47.952
Paul, unless I have something more to go on,
my hands are tied.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.197
O'Shea has an ironclad alibi, right?

21:51.320 --> 21:53.880
You were there.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.436
I see I'm wasting my time with you guys.

21:58.680 --> 22:02.434
I got some more questions. I'll be calling you.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.120
Still not sure what you're doing here.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.437
Well, it's a little over your head, Lieutenant.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.269
Why don't you just do your job, I'll do mine. OK?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.474
<i>(Hoyle)</i> Excuse me.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.477
<i>(Vasquez)</i> Lieutenant.

22:17.600 --> 22:23.436
I remember when he was fixing parking tickets
in the DA's office. Let's get outta here.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.349
- How's Chelsea?
- Don't worry, Professor. She sleeps upstairs.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.918
<i>- (Kersey)</i> How'd this happen?
<i>- (Olivia)</i> Chelsea's father's here.

23:17.040 --> 23:21.272
<i>- (Kersey)</i> He did this to you?
<i>- (Olivia)</i> It's a way of life for him.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.836
- I could tell you a lot more.
- You've told me enough.

23:24.960 --> 23:28.714
<i>(Olivia)</i> I couldn't keep him out.
He saw an opportunity and he pounced.

23:28.840 --> 23:33.755
The unions, trucking,
he has infiltrated every aspect of my business

23:33.880 --> 23:36.553
and most everyone else in the garment district.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.719
<i>(Hoyle)</i> Tommy O'Shea.
I hope she realizes her whole life will change.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.628
<i>- (Kersey)</i> She hopes it's for the better.
<i>- (Doctor)</i> I'm not pulling any punches.

23:44.760 --> 23:49.197
Even with reconstruction,
the face will never be the same.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.311
<i>(Chicki)</i> You got a problem?

23:51.440 --> 23:55.479
<i>- (O'Shea)</i> Guns make you nervous?
<i>- (Kersey)</i> Guns have their uses.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.353
<i>(Kersey)</i> Idiots with guns make me nervous.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.071
# For it was Reggie #

24:21.400 --> 24:24.915
Little Reggie's been telling tales
and talking out of school.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.110
Now who's Reggie been talking to?

24:27.240 --> 24:32.792
- I said nothing to nobody, you white trash.
- I had no idea you were so prejudiced.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.676
I usually get a shine with that.
Do what you want with him.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.395
- There you go saying stupid things again.
- Hey, Sal.

24:44.520 --> 24:50.117
You're looking a little rumpled.
What do you say we straighten you out?

24:50.240 --> 24:53.232
<i>- (Chicki)</i> It's not a good thing.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.110
Aagh!

24:59.640 --> 25:05.078
Reg, we know you've been talking to somebody.
Why don't you just tell us who?

25:05.200 --> 25:09.990
- I ain't said nothing to nobody.
- He ain't said nothing to nobody.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.913
- I bet that smarts, eh? Reg? Reg?
- What?

25:19.040 --> 25:22.271
- Why did you do it? Don't lie!
- I said nothing.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.710
You're lying! Let's straighten his hair. Come on.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.799
Let's straighten his hair. Yeah, that's better.

25:30.880 --> 25:35.749
Well, Reg, now you're all straightened out.
Say goodnight.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.677
Chicki, we'll meet you and Reg down in the car.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.678
Get up. Get up.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.075
Goodnight, Reg.

<i>- (Albert)</i> OK, is that it?
- Yeah, here it is.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.876
Looks like a pen, doesn't it?

26:05.000 --> 26:09.630
When we get this new recorded evidence,
we're gonna nail O'Shea.

26:09.760 --> 26:13.435

- Don't worry.

26:13.560 --> 26:17.235

- You're damn right.

What about the laundry shipment
coming this afternoon?

28:05.000 --> 28:09.710
Laundry? Oh, you mean the clothes
for the homeless shelter?

28:10.680 --> 28:14.229
- What?
- You know, people without homes.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.353
You forgot? You don't care about people
less fortunate than you? Disgusting.

28:18.480 --> 28:23.600
I'm gonna strike you from my Christmas list.
Mind if I borrow your pen?

28:33.160 --> 28:35.435
Thanks, Albert.

Goodbye, Albert.

Why were you there, anyway?
You're not going back to your old ways?

30:48.040 --> 30:52.556
- Is that such a bad idea?
- Let the cops take these guys down.

30:52.680 --> 30:56.912
- You know, sometimes the law works.
- And sometimes it doesn't.

30:57.040 --> 31:01.318
These people steal, murder,
destroy people's lives, and get away with it.

31:01.440 --> 31:06.639
They have alibis, money, lawyers, power.
They have everything.

31:08.360 --> 31:13.195
Tell me something. How long
have you been trying to take these guys down?

31:13.320 --> 31:20.158
16 years. These guys are pros. It's not like
it's some gang of doped-out muggers.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.191
16 years?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.760

Olivia, you don't know how hard
it is for me to say this.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.078
Let the law deal with Tommy.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.989
OK. Whatever you say.

33:56.120 --> 33:59.351
First I have to make a telephone call.

- No.

I'm sorry, Professor Stewart.
He has the legal rights.

I apologize, sir.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.596

Son of a bitch is quick.

Professor, what's happened? What is it?

46:40.840 --> 46:46.358

I can't let Tommy get away with this.

<i>(Kersey)</i> Gather your men together and leave.

<i>- (King)</i> Going back to your old ways?
- Is that a bad idea?

46:56.520 --> 47:00.433
<i>- (King)</i> Let the law do it. Sometimes it works.
<i>- (Kersey)</i> Sometimes it doesn't.

47:00.560 --> 47:04.633
These people steal, murder,
destroy people's lives, and get away with it.

47:04.760 --> 47:09.470

- OK.

I'll see Chicki at Tommy's.

Anna, I love your canoli!

Chicki, you eat too many,
you're gonna turn into a blimp.

I'll be a happy blimp.

Chicki, are you OK? Chicki!

Chicki, what's wrong?

Everybody's going to ball games together.
It doesn't make any sense.

51:28.320 --> 51:32.836
Chicki. He had no concept of security.

51:32.960 --> 51:37.511
He was, like, naked.
You should learn from this.

51:37.640 --> 51:41.872
Sure, become a paranoid schizophrenic
like you.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.798
You got it wrong, Tommy.

I never thanked you personally

55:02.600 --> 55:04.795
That's OK.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.153
The money was your thanks.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.749
Who killed Chick?

55:12.880 --> 55:16.919
Well, you got a problem.

Ever hear the name Paul Kersey,
a vigilante killer a few years back?

55:21.560 --> 55:22.549
Oh, yeah.

55:22.680 --> 55:25.478
That was your ex-wife's boyfriend.

Professor.

- You people have him?
- Not any more.

- He did Chicki?
<i>- (Vasquez)</i> Kersey's no amateur.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.550
You pissed him off.

- How do we find him?
- I could remedy that situation.

55:43.240 --> 55:46.869
- But it's gonna cost you.
- No kidding?

55:48.600 --> 55:50.955
- Have at it.
- Deal.

55:54.800 --> 55:56.119
You know...

55:57.280 --> 56:00.317
Kersey's gonna be going down the list.

Get it?

56:07.680 --> 56:09.910
- Hey, Hector.

56:13.320 --> 56:15.675
Something you're wearing?

56:16.480 --> 56:19.711
I don't know, Tommy. Check Sal.

56:20.680 --> 56:21.874
Scumbag.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.279
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

56:33.440 --> 56:36.830
- We gotta call Freddie.
- Don't worry about Freddie.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.073
You know Freddie. He's in the womb.

56:41.560 --> 56:42.549
What?

56:43.160 --> 56:45.276
- The womb.
<i>- (laughs)</i>

57:34.000 --> 57:36.389
Hm. Birthday present?

57:36.960 --> 57:41.670
- A treat for someone special.
- How lovely. Won't they be surprised?

57:55.920 --> 57:59.435
You look great in that outfit.
Do you think it'll fit me?

57:59.560 --> 58:02.313
That depends. Are you into pain?

58:02.440 --> 58:06.831
- This is the only place I feel safe any more.
- Want some wine?

58:06.960 --> 58:10.111
You go ahead. I gotta keep my head clear.

58:13.320 --> 58:16.517
Of course the stress is making me itch.

58:16.640 --> 58:19.200
- Sure you don't want some wine?
- Yeah.

58:19.320 --> 58:23.029
- Maybe milk, to calm me down.
- No, milk's bad for dandruff.

58:23.160 --> 58:25.196
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:25.320 --> 58:28.949
I gotta get a new dermatologist.
That guy's a joke.

- I'll give you some buttons to push.
- Yeah.

58:36.880 --> 58:40.395
- I just gotta calm down, you know.
- Oh, lighten up.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.077
You sound like Tommy.

58:43.200 --> 58:48.274
Tommy's being stupid and careless. He thinks
he's got some guns, some goons, he's safe.

58:48.400 --> 58:51.915
<i>(Freddie)</i> I'm worried about him.
He used to be smarter than that.

58:52.040 --> 58:55.953
What happens if Tommy goes down?
Will he be loyal to me?

59:14.840 --> 59:19.072
This stuff is supposed to kill every flake
on my head.

59:19.200 --> 59:25.639
- It smells like the stuff they use on cockroaches.
- Who are you calling a cockroach?

Sorry, I just got off the phone

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.950
- He's gonna call in a few minutes.
- The assistant?

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.071
No, the mayor.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.352
First Paconi, then Flakes. He's going down
the list. Make sure O'Shea's covered.

You can't take the law into your own hands.
Let me help you.

You can help me by meeting me

Neither did I.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.112
You're right.
You can't trust the justice system.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.237
He would have killed you, Brian.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.558
Yeah.

Well, open the goddamn thing, dummy.

You know, it's the first time I've ever looked
at that son of a bitch and it didn't irritate me.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.995
Ship him to Jersey.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.952
Then upstairs and check out Chelsea.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:14.758
This is no good, Tommy.
This is a vendetta that we brought on ourselves.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.952
Now Vasquez is gone, that's terrific.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:23.916
- This is bad for business.
- Vasquez got what he deserved.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.872
We can always buy somebody else.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.595
Just concentrate on Kersey.
Concentrate on Kersey.

Your blood pressure, part of it's your diet.

You eat like you're going to the electric chair.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.394
I don't need you to tell me how to eat.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.555
Concentrate on Kersey.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.589
I think we oughta give the lamb to the wolf.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:23.555
- We'll catch Kersey using Chelsea as bait.
- What are you talking about? Lamb, wolf?

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.995
Kersey, he knows every move we're making,

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.554
and somebody's helping him out.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.116
You're the lamb, Sallie.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.676
- Are you selling me out? No!
- No, listen to me.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.759
Do the same thing you do every Sunday,
go to church,

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.429
drop the cash at Olivia's,
do everything like on Sunday.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.198
Sure, and get barbecued like Freddie Flakes.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.959
He won't get near you, I promise.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.469
You promise. You promise.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.029
So I pick Chelsea up here
and Kersey's gonna do nothing?

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.039
No, you lead him to the factory
and right into the trap.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.391
<i>(Max)</i> Don't they look nice?

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.080
There she is.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.716
Poor, sweet, dim-witted Max.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.832
- Our resident retard.
- What?

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.078
Chicki choked to death on a canoli.
Do you not remember?

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.351
If you had a brain, you would play with it!

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.748
- Don't!
- Moron!

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.473
<i>(church bell rings)</i>

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.355
Hello, Tommy? I got Kersey on my tail.
I'm going to pick up Chelsea.

<i>(horns blare)</i>

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.360
Hi, sweetheart.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:32.192
Tommy? Yeah, I got Chelsea.
Get everybody ready. We're on our way.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:50.033
Angel, check out the toys.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.277
Let's rock and roll!

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.873
All right.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.678
Rock and roll your butts downstairs.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.669
And give Mr. Kersey the warmest of welcomes.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.159
Let's do it. Come on.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.719
<i>(drunk rambling)</i>

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.272
Stay there.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.709
Now, come on. Let's go.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.152
Hey, hey!

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.753
Get in there!

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.828
<i>(O'Shea)</i> You guys in position?
Kersey should be showing up any time.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.114
- Kersey won't know what hit him.
- Make him suffer.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.439
He's right behind me, the asshole.
He's walking right into it.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.118
Wonderful.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.038
Chelsea.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.549
Chelsea, come here.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.596
You'd better come over here,
you stubborn little shit.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.917
- No.
<i>- (Sal)</i> Hey, do what your father tells you.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.793
<i>(Sal)</i> You spoilt little brat.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.830
He's inside.

He's history.

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.432
Shit.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.274
Aagh!

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.872
- Where's the girl?
- Don't know.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.552
Frankie?

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.159
Frankie?

Mickey.

Mickey?

Get up there. Get up there!

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.479
I'll take the walkie-talkie.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.997
- What are you gonna do?
- Help you remember.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.588
Hold that. Hold it!

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.429
Come on, Kersey.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.872
What's this all about?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.515
I don't know nothing.
Come on.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.115
Come on, Kersey.

- She's upstairs in the big room.

- Anybody with her?
- Sal and Tommy.

How've you been doing?

Did you get Kersey?

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.714
Answer me!

I'm coming for you, O'Shea.

Moron.

I have no gun, right?

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.032

would you?
