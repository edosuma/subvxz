01:47.534 --> 01:49.411
This is Paris.

01:49.660 --> 01:52.080
And I'm an American
who lives here.

01:52.330 --> 01:53.831
My name, Jerry Mulligan...

01:54.082 --> 01:55.750
... and I'm an ex-G.I.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.297
In 1945, when the Army
told me to find my own job...

01:59.547 --> 02:00.547
... I stayed on.

02:00.798 --> 02:02.091
And I'll tell you why.

02:02.341 --> 02:03.718
I'm a painter.

02:03.968 --> 02:06.929
All my life that's all
I've ever wanted to do.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.890
For a painter,
the mecca of the world for study...

02:10.140 --> 02:11.934
... for inspiration and for living...

02:12.185 --> 02:17.107
... is here on this star called Paris.

02:17.191 --> 02:18.859
Just look at it.

02:19.109 --> 02:22.488
No wonder so many artists
have come here and called it home.

02:22.738 --> 02:27.493
Brother, if you can't paint in Paris,
give up and marry the boss' daughter.

02:27.743 --> 02:31.956
We're on the Left Bank now.
That's where I'm billeted.

02:32.207 --> 02:34.125
Here's my street.

02:34.375 --> 02:35.752
In the past couple of years...

02:36.002 --> 02:38.129
... I've gotten to know
practically everyone on the block.

02:38.379 --> 02:41.090
And a nicer bunch
you'll never meet.

02:41.341 --> 02:44.135
Back home everyone
said I didn't have any talent.

02:44.385 --> 02:46.596
They might be saying
the same thing over here...

02:46.846 --> 02:49.475
... but it sounds better in French.

02:49.725 --> 02:52.895
I live upstairs.

02:54.230 --> 02:56.107
No, not there.

02:56.357 --> 02:58.943
One flight up.

04:31.499 --> 04:34.211
Jerry!

04:35.504 --> 04:36.922
Those are three of my pals.

04:37.172 --> 04:40.258
Etienne, Maurice and Jacques.

04:40.509 --> 04:45.555
I'm their man because
I give them American bubble gum.

04:46.014 --> 04:48.892
I have a lot of
good friends in Paris.

04:49.142 --> 04:51.562
A lot of very good friends.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.314
And I am one of them.

04:53.564 --> 04:55.358
Adam Cook is my name.

04:55.608 --> 04:56.943
I'm a concert pianist.

04:57.193 --> 05:01.280
That's a pretentious way of
saying I'm unemployed at the moment.

05:01.531 --> 05:06.786
I live in the same brick pile
with young Rembrandt.

05:07.538 --> 05:08.747
That's not me.

05:08.997 --> 05:10.749
He's too happy.

05:10.999 --> 05:12.376
I'm here on a scholarship.

05:12.626 --> 05:16.171
Last year, I won the Hackenwall prize
and was sent abroad to study.

05:16.421 --> 05:19.550
That's the eighth fellowship I've won.
And you know something?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.635
I'm getting pretty homesick.

05:21.885 --> 05:28.143
Not only that, but I'm beginning to feel
like the world's oldest child prodigy.

05:29.477 --> 05:33.189
One time I ran out of fellowships
and had to go to work for a living.

05:33.439 --> 05:35.859
I had to stop because
I discovered I liked it...

05:36.109 --> 05:39.737
... and I didn't want to become
a slave to the habit.

05:39.988 --> 05:41.990
It's not a pretty face, I grant you.

05:42.241 --> 05:47.371
But underneath its flabby exterior
is an enormous lack of character.

05:47.621 --> 05:49.165
I like Paris.

05:49.415 --> 05:51.250
It's a place where you don't
run into old friends.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.503
Although that's never
been one of my problems.

05:54.753 --> 05:58.382
Strangely enough, I made a friend
over here once. I worked for him.

05:58.632 --> 06:00.385
His name was Henri Baurel.

06:00.635 --> 06:02.971
You know, the French music hall star?

06:03.221 --> 06:05.849
Do you remember him?

06:06.183 --> 06:09.519
I do, because that's me.

06:10.145 --> 06:13.732
Adam was a fine accompanist.
I wish he were still with me.

06:13.982 --> 06:18.070
My, how nice to be
in the old quarter!

06:18.362 --> 06:22.200
You see?
Everybody recognizes me.

06:22.241 --> 06:24.243
I guess I haven't changed
so much after all.

06:24.494 --> 06:26.496
They've known me a long time.

06:26.746 --> 06:28.289
But now, don't misunderstand.

06:28.539 --> 06:30.374
I don't mean
to imply that I am old.

06:30.625 --> 06:33.377
I'm not.
After all, I am only...

06:33.628 --> 06:36.256
Well, what's the difference?

06:36.507 --> 06:40.844
No, that's not me.
I am not that young.

06:41.094 --> 06:42.346
Let's just say...

06:42.596 --> 06:46.934
... I am old enough to know what to do
with my young feelings.

06:47.184 --> 06:49.770
Right?

06:51.689 --> 06:56.569
- Georges!
- Henri Baurel!

07:02.242 --> 07:06.079
- Henri!
- Mathilde!

07:17.216 --> 07:20.010
Adam?

07:34.568 --> 07:36.278
You used to
sing it a tone higher.

07:36.528 --> 07:39.197
I'm a big boy now.
My voice is changing.

07:39.447 --> 07:41.658
- Shall I come up?
- No, I'll be right down.

07:41.908 --> 07:45.163
Hey, Georges,
some coffee!

07:45.621 --> 07:50.751
Henri, I'm going to
make you an "omelette รก la confiture".

07:52.712 --> 07:54.464
Don't kiss me.
You'll spoil my makeup.

07:54.714 --> 07:55.715
You look great, Hank.

07:55.965 --> 07:57.675
What're you doing?
Taking injections?

07:57.925 --> 07:59.135
Something much better.

07:59.385 --> 08:00.470
I hear your show's a big hit.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.140
It is, "naturellement".

08:03.390 --> 08:04.850
- When did you get over?
- Last March.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.351
I phoned you,
but there was no answer.

08:06.602 --> 08:08.812
I'd have phoned again, but I was
afraid you might be in.

08:09.062 --> 08:10.898
March? I wasn't in Paris then.

08:11.148 --> 08:14.776
Lise and I were
visiting friends in Juan-les-Pins.

08:16.862 --> 08:18.489
- Some coffee, please.
- What are you working on?

08:18.740 --> 08:21.034
- Same old concert.
- When will you give it?

08:21.284 --> 08:24.954
When I can't figure out
any more reasons not to.

08:26.247 --> 08:27.707
Some coffee, please.

08:27.957 --> 08:31.461
I took Lise to hear
Weingarten play the other night.

08:31.711 --> 08:35.173
It was her first concert,
and her eyes were shining two days.

08:35.423 --> 08:38.594
Why didn't you take her to an eye
doctor? Incidentally, who's Lise?

08:38.844 --> 08:40.554
That's the second time
that name has come up.

08:40.804 --> 08:43.015
Adam, I am very happy these days.

08:43.265 --> 08:44.350
I'll show you her picture.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.352
- Are you married?
- Not yet.

08:46.602 --> 08:48.437
Pretty. Very pretty.

08:48.687 --> 08:51.690
- She looks familiar.
- She's Jacques Bouvier's daughter.

08:51.941 --> 08:54.861
Jacques Bouvier?

08:58.740 --> 09:01.326
My coffee.

09:04.037 --> 09:06.373
Poor Jacques.
He was caught in the Resistance.

09:06.623 --> 09:10.085
I took care of Lise all through
the occupation. She lived in my house.

09:10.335 --> 09:11.462
Your house?

09:11.712 --> 09:12.880
Shocking, but generous.

09:13.131 --> 09:14.590
She was a little girl then.

09:14.841 --> 09:18.302
We only became
in love after she left.

09:18.553 --> 09:20.179
She's a little young for you,
isn't she?

09:20.429 --> 09:22.640
No, not really. She's 19.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.725
She's getting on.
What's she like?

09:24.976 --> 09:28.105
Well, she has great vitality
and "joie de vivre".

09:28.355 --> 09:32.276
She loves to go out, have fun and
dance. She could dance all night.

09:32.526 --> 09:34.444
Sounds tiresome.
Kind of a wild kid, huh?

09:34.695 --> 09:37.906
Wild?
Whatever gave you that idea?

09:38.157 --> 09:39.366
No, she's very simple.

09:39.616 --> 09:41.243
Very simple.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.246
She works all day at the
Maison Nicole, the perfume shop.

09:44.496 --> 09:47.083
I prefer not to
discuss the matter any further.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.918
Be serious.

09:49.169 --> 09:51.212
She's an enchanting girl, Adam.

09:51.463 --> 09:57.177
Not really beautiful,
and yet, she has great beauty.

10:17.364 --> 10:18.616
Very spiritual type, huh?

10:18.866 --> 10:19.950
Not at all.

10:20.201 --> 10:23.914
She's an exciting girl, Adam.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.104
She seems to be
a lusty young lady.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.775
No! She's sweet and shy.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.791
An old-fashioned girl, huh?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.292
Course not!

11:07.543 --> 11:11.380
She's vivacious and modern.

11:18.012 --> 11:19.264
Always yakking it up?

11:19.514 --> 11:23.810
Don't be silly!
She reads incessantly.

11:54.634 --> 11:56.178
Doesn't all that reading
make her moody?

11:56.428 --> 12:01.516
Never.
She's the gayest girl in the world.

12:40.642 --> 12:44.687
Look, let's start
all over again, shall we?

12:44.938 --> 12:47.982
What's she like?

12:49.818 --> 12:51.069
Good morning, Therese.

12:51.319 --> 12:52.403
How are you today, "monsieur"?

12:52.654 --> 12:54.155
I could be better, Therese.
I'm broke.

12:54.405 --> 12:56.449
- Broke?
- That means I have no money.

12:56.700 --> 13:00.079
When I'm broke I don't eat.
Then I get tired and depressed.

13:00.329 --> 13:02.915
When that happens, the only thing
that helps is wine and women.

13:03.165 --> 13:05.960
That should be very simple.
You are in Paris.

13:06.210 --> 13:08.128
But even in Paris
that takes money...

13:08.379 --> 13:12.758
...which is what
I don't have in the first place.

13:13.843 --> 13:14.886
This isn't music!

13:15.137 --> 13:17.305
It's uncivilized.
It's noise.

13:17.556 --> 13:19.349
- Hi!
- Hi.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.352
Jerry, this is Henri Baurel.
Jerry Mulligan.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.020
How do you do?
I know you.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.481
I've heard you sing a thousand times.
You're wonderful.

13:26.731 --> 13:27.732
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

13:27.983 --> 13:29.818
Do you have
300 francs on you?

13:30.068 --> 13:31.946
I'm going to Montmartre.
I need lunch money.

13:32.196 --> 13:34.782
Sorry. Bought a postage stamp
and it broke me.

13:35.032 --> 13:35.992
Please allow me.

13:36.242 --> 13:37.243
No, thanks.

13:37.493 --> 13:40.204
I never touch a guy
unless I've known him 15 minutes.

13:40.454 --> 13:45.334
I've known him 15 years.
Lend me 300.

13:47.837 --> 13:51.216
I wouldn't lend him money if I were
you. He's a bum risk.

13:51.466 --> 13:55.554
Adam! For this you win a scholarship?

13:55.804 --> 13:58.348
What's the matter?
Evidently the man doesn't like jazz.

13:58.599 --> 14:00.225
- He's against it.
- What else is there?

14:00.476 --> 14:04.188
I know what he likes.
He's strictly a three-quarter man.

14:04.438 --> 14:05.564
Old Vienna.

14:05.814 --> 14:08.067
Franz Josef!

14:08.318 --> 14:10.945
The Palace of Schรถnbrunn.

14:11.196 --> 14:15.658
- Kaffee with Schlagsahne.
- And Wienerschnitzel.

15:01.249 --> 15:02.583
- Dog!
- Pig!

15:02.834 --> 15:05.503
My card!

16:54.618 --> 16:58.372
Gentlemen!
The Emperor!

19:20.439 --> 19:25.152
Relax, sister.
I'm from Perth Amboy, New Jersey.

19:25.444 --> 19:29.782
I can see disregarding perspective
to achieve an effect, but I believe...

19:30.032 --> 19:32.451
Why don't you be
a good little girl and move on?

19:32.702 --> 19:35.663
You won't buy anything.
You're just blocking out the sunshine.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.041
I just wanted
to discuss your work.

19:38.292 --> 19:40.419
I don't want you
to discuss my work.

19:40.669 --> 19:43.255
I'm not interested
in your opinion of my work.

19:43.505 --> 19:45.757
If you say something nice
I won't feel better...

19:46.008 --> 19:47.176
...and if you don't
it'll bother me.

19:47.426 --> 19:50.762
Thank you. Good day.

19:52.598 --> 19:54.058
Do you mind if I look...

19:54.309 --> 19:56.102
...or will you chew
my head off too?

19:56.352 --> 19:57.562
Go ahead.
You're okay.

19:57.812 --> 19:58.855
Thank you.

19:59.105 --> 20:01.399
She's a third-year girl
that gripes my liver.

20:01.649 --> 20:02.734
Third-year girls?

20:02.984 --> 20:04.319
You know, American college kids.

20:04.569 --> 20:07.405
They come here to take their third
year and lap up some culture.

20:07.655 --> 20:08.948
They give me a swift pain.

20:09.199 --> 20:10.700
Why?
They're harmless enough.

20:10.950 --> 20:12.411
They're officious and dull.

20:12.661 --> 20:18.000
They always make profound
observations they've overheard.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.044
Say, do you have
a cigarette?

20:20.294 --> 20:22.963
- I think so.
- Thanks.

20:23.214 --> 20:25.049
Don't you like criticism?

20:25.299 --> 20:30.305
Who does? Tough enough getting
it from those who know.

20:33.808 --> 20:35.477
My first today.

20:35.727 --> 20:37.854
My guess is the business
isn't very good.

20:38.104 --> 20:41.775
Your guess is
right on the nose.

20:52.787 --> 20:55.456
You know...

20:55.790 --> 20:57.416
...I like these two.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.377
Thanks. So do I.

20:59.627 --> 21:02.630
I want to buy them.

21:02.755 --> 21:05.759
How much are they?

21:06.051 --> 21:07.344
Gee, I don't know.

21:07.594 --> 21:08.846
You don't know?

21:09.096 --> 21:13.183
I never thought I'd come to the point
where that would be an issue.

21:13.433 --> 21:15.227
Offer me something.

21:15.477 --> 21:18.647
15,000 francs.

21:19.439 --> 21:21.150
For each.

21:21.401 --> 21:23.027
Will that be satisfactory?

21:23.278 --> 21:25.697
That'll be
good and satisfactory.

21:25.947 --> 21:27.407
You sure you know what you're doing?

21:27.657 --> 21:30.827
What do you care?

21:30.869 --> 21:32.996
That's about $50 apiece,
isn't it?

21:33.246 --> 21:35.665
I don't know.
I haven't changed money lately.

21:35.915 --> 21:36.875
Oh, dear!

21:37.125 --> 21:40.713
- What's the matter?
- I haven't got enough with me.

21:40.963 --> 21:44.008
Come back tomorrow.
It's a cinch they'll still be here.

21:44.258 --> 21:47.553
Why don't you come to the hotel?
I can pay you there.

21:47.803 --> 21:49.221
Fine. Is it far?

21:49.471 --> 21:52.808
Would you care if it were?

21:58.481 --> 22:00.567
- What's your name?
- Jerry Mulligan. Yours?

22:00.817 --> 22:02.235
Milo Roberts.

22:02.485 --> 22:06.281
- Milo?
- Yeah, as in "Venus de".

22:06.531 --> 22:09.367
Venus de.

22:10.076 --> 22:13.456
Is this yours?

22:14.415 --> 22:18.252
Maybe I should have
charged you more.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.854
I'll be back.
Make yourself at home.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.288
Here.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.873
Thanks.

22:54.123 --> 22:58.670
- Would you like some sherry?
- All right.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.506
How'd you come by
these worldly possessions?

23:01.756 --> 23:03.341
A rich husband or father?

23:03.591 --> 23:04.634
A father.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.846
- What's he do?
- Oil.

23:07.096 --> 23:08.556
I should have known.

23:08.806 --> 23:10.307
Suntan oil.

23:10.558 --> 23:13.686
Really? I didn't know
there was so much in that racket.

23:13.936 --> 23:16.981
-There's a lot of red skin in America.
- There must be.

23:17.231 --> 23:20.067
Let's see now.
Where shall I hang these?

23:20.317 --> 23:21.527
Maybe over on...

23:21.777 --> 23:24.155
Here's a good place.
Good light.

23:24.406 --> 23:25.866
Not too much sun.

23:26.116 --> 23:27.993
That'll be fine.

23:28.243 --> 23:30.620
By golly, you know, these are good!

23:30.871 --> 23:32.664
I've seen hundreds of paintings
by young artists...

23:32.914 --> 23:35.166
...and not one has
impressed me till these!

23:35.417 --> 23:37.919
I'm glad.
Makes it easier to give up.

23:38.169 --> 23:39.171
Give up?

23:39.421 --> 23:42.550
It's kind of hard
for an artist to sell.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.387
A writer, a composer can
buy a copy of what they create.

23:46.637 --> 23:48.723
With a painter,
it's the original that counts.

23:48.973 --> 23:51.267
Once that's gone,
it's out of his life.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.020
I never thought of that.

23:54.270 --> 23:57.316
Excuse me for a minute.

23:58.775 --> 24:00.068
Hello, Tommy.

24:00.319 --> 24:01.612
No, dear.
Don't come up.

24:01.862 --> 24:04.531
Be a darling and wait
for me in the dining room.

24:04.781 --> 24:07.367
I'll be right down.

24:07.618 --> 24:09.286
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stay long.

24:09.536 --> 24:11.288
Don't apologize.
I wanted you to.

24:11.538 --> 24:14.082
I wish we had more time to talk.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.836
Goodbye, and thanks again.

24:17.086 --> 24:18.755
By the way...

24:19.005 --> 24:20.548
...what are you going to do tonight?

24:20.798 --> 24:21.758
Why?

24:22.008 --> 24:24.260
I'm giving
a small party here.

24:24.511 --> 24:27.222
There'll be an extra girl.
Why not come?

24:27.472 --> 24:28.431
I don't know.

24:28.681 --> 24:30.829
Do you have a date?

24:30.864 --> 24:32.978
Well, then come.

24:33.229 --> 24:35.689
You'll find the company very easy.
Nothing formal.

24:35.940 --> 24:38.567
- Be here at eight.
- Okay.

24:38.817 --> 24:43.489
My car can take you home.
He has nothing to do.

24:43.864 --> 24:46.492
Thanks.

24:58.213 --> 25:00.799
Me, me!

25:16.774 --> 25:21.112
Jerry, do you have any bubble gum?

25:25.868 --> 25:29.454
"Demain." Tomorrow.

25:29.705 --> 25:32.958
Tomorrow.

25:44.971 --> 25:48.224
- Rรฉpรฉtez aprรฉs moi. "Door."
- Door!

25:48.474 --> 25:50.393
- Street.
- Street!

25:50.643 --> 25:52.687
- Lady.
- Lady!

25:52.937 --> 25:54.647
- Window.
- Window!

25:54.898 --> 25:58.610
- Flowers.
- Flowers!

26:03.866 --> 26:07.912
"Monsieur le" wise guy.

26:08.579 --> 26:10.372
A very hard word.

26:10.623 --> 26:13.584
Massachusetts!

26:17.172 --> 26:20.133
An American song.

26:20.383 --> 26:24.721
- I got.
- I got.

26:25.138 --> 26:27.933
Good.

28:35.235 --> 28:38.112
Charleston!

28:51.112 --> 28:54.046
Choo-choo train!

29:00.511 --> 29:03.264
Soldier!

29:11.398 --> 29:13.942
Napoleon!

29:14.192 --> 29:17.028
Cowboy!

29:18.196 --> 29:21.616
Hopalong Cassidy!

29:43.139 --> 29:47.019
- Charles!
- Charlie Chaplin!

29:50.397 --> 29:54.568
Airplane!

30:02.493 --> 30:05.997
More!

30:23.432 --> 30:26.560
- Good evening. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Good evening.

30:26.810 --> 30:28.270
The moment I went to dress...

30:28.520 --> 30:31.273
...the phone started ringing
like a steeple on Sunday.

30:31.523 --> 30:32.524
Would you like one of these?

30:32.775 --> 30:34.276
Fine, fine.

30:34.526 --> 30:37.197
I've never seen so many
Americans in Paris before.

30:37.447 --> 30:40.659
The Champs Elysรฉe looks
just like Main Street.

30:40.909 --> 30:42.410
Do you live here
all the time?

30:42.661 --> 30:48.583
I usually go home to Baltimore
for Christmas and Thanksgiving.

30:48.618 --> 30:52.212
That's quite a dress
you almost have on.

30:52.462 --> 30:54.757
- Thanks.
- What holds it up?

30:55.007 --> 30:56.092
Modesty.

30:56.342 --> 30:59.220
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:59.470 --> 31:02.348
I see it's a formal brawl
after all.

31:02.598 --> 31:03.599
What makes you think that?

31:03.849 --> 31:06.686
The more formal the party is,
the less you have to wear.

31:06.936 --> 31:09.814
No, you're quite wrong.
It's most informal.

31:10.064 --> 31:11.942
Where is everybody?

31:12.192 --> 31:13.402
Here.

31:13.652 --> 31:15.654
Downstairs?

31:15.904 --> 31:18.949
No, here in this room.

31:19.074 --> 31:22.494
What about that extra girl?

31:22.744 --> 31:25.497
That's me.

31:26.623 --> 31:29.502
- The party's you and me?
- That's right.

31:29.752 --> 31:33.131
I see. It's kind of
a little joke, isn't it?

31:33.381 --> 31:36.092
In a way.

31:37.385 --> 31:38.469
Well, lady...

31:38.720 --> 31:41.931
...here's your dough back. I'll
take my pictures and run along.

31:42.181 --> 31:43.266
Wait a minute.

31:43.516 --> 31:44.684
Wait, my foot!

31:44.934 --> 31:47.146
You must be
out of your mink-lined head!

31:47.396 --> 31:49.440
I know I need dough, but
I don't need it this badly.

31:49.690 --> 31:50.983
If you're hard up for companionship...

31:51.233 --> 31:53.235
...they have guys in town who
do this for a living.

31:53.485 --> 31:55.571
Call one of them.

31:55.821 --> 31:56.822
What's so funny?

31:57.072 --> 31:59.825
You! You're so righteous.

32:00.075 --> 32:02.536
Stop defending your honor
so assiduously...

32:02.786 --> 32:04.664
...and listen to me for a minute.

32:04.915 --> 32:07.334
I don't need a paid escort.

32:07.584 --> 32:11.504
And I'm not trying to rob you
of your precious male initiative.

32:11.755 --> 32:14.841
I'm interested in your work
and want to know you better.

32:15.091 --> 32:16.551
Is that such a crime?

32:16.801 --> 32:19.846
Well, it certainly is
a roundabout way to do it.

32:20.096 --> 32:24.435
Would you have accepted
a normal invitation?

32:24.560 --> 32:25.561
I want to help you.

32:25.811 --> 32:29.357
I think you have
a great deal of talent.

32:29.607 --> 32:32.318
It doesn't hurt to have
somebody rooting for you, does it?

32:32.568 --> 32:37.114
- It'll be the first time anybody ever did.
- Then let me.

32:37.365 --> 32:39.952
Please?

32:42.204 --> 32:44.414
How's the food downstairs?

32:44.665 --> 32:47.417
- Very good.
- And probably very expensive.

32:47.668 --> 32:50.337
Would it embarrass you
if I signed the check?

32:50.587 --> 32:52.089
Let's go someplace I can afford.

32:52.339 --> 32:55.217
How about the Cafรฉ Flodair
on Montparnasse?

32:55.467 --> 32:57.679
I feel like "jazz hot".
It's not expensive.

32:57.929 --> 32:59.389
It better not be.

32:59.639 --> 33:04.143
I'd like to show a little profit
at the end of the day.

33:22.788 --> 33:24.373
How long did it last?

33:24.623 --> 33:26.417
About two years.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.043
I lost him in the war.

33:28.294 --> 33:29.712
I'm sorry.

33:29.962 --> 33:31.798
To another woman.

33:32.048 --> 33:34.175
Somebody he met in California
while he was in training.

33:34.426 --> 33:36.094
If he was the dog you
said he was...

33:36.344 --> 33:37.971
...you must have been glad
to be rid of him.

33:38.221 --> 33:40.265
I was, I guess, except that I...

33:40.515 --> 33:42.851
Except it would have been
more satisfactory...

33:43.101 --> 33:44.311
...if you could have kissed him off.

33:44.561 --> 33:45.645
I guess.

33:45.896 --> 33:48.024
You should get married again.
You need it.

33:48.274 --> 33:49.400
- Why?
- Everybody does.

33:49.650 --> 33:51.527
Everybody must
have someone to account to.

33:51.777 --> 33:54.655
Especially when you don't work.
It keeps the personality together.

33:54.906 --> 33:56.574
No, thank you.
Not for me.

33:56.824 --> 33:58.993
- Besides, I have work to do.
- What?

33:59.243 --> 34:01.120
Well, for the moment, you.

34:01.370 --> 34:03.664
I want to bring you
to the attention of dealers.

34:03.915 --> 34:06.084
They know me.
I'm a big customer.

34:06.335 --> 34:07.920
We have a large collection at home.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.963
I could sponsor you...

34:10.214 --> 34:12.549
...talk about you, encourage you.

34:12.799 --> 34:16.178
When you've done enough canvases
I could arrange your first show.

34:16.428 --> 34:18.554
That is, if you'll let me.

34:18.804 --> 34:21.350
It sounds great,
but what's in it for you?

34:21.600 --> 34:24.853
Just the excitement of
helping somebody I believe in...

34:25.103 --> 34:28.440
...and finding out if I'm right.

34:28.524 --> 34:31.319
- Milo, darling.
- Tommy! I knew you'd turn up here.

34:31.569 --> 34:32.779
This is Jerry Mulligan.

34:33.029 --> 34:36.532
This is Tommy Baldwin.
He's on the "Paris Telegram".

34:36.783 --> 34:40.329
Milo, I'm showing the Jansens
around and need your help.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.498
What do you say?
Shall we go to his rescue?

34:42.748 --> 34:43.706
Anything you like.

34:43.958 --> 34:48.712
Follow me. You need radar to
find your way in this smoke.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.722
- Who are the Jansens?
- Magazine illustrators.

34:57.973 --> 35:01.601
- What're they like?
- Death.

35:04.854 --> 35:09.025
- Look what I found.
- What a pleasant surprise!

35:09.276 --> 35:13.154
- Jack, say hello to Milo.
- Hello, Milo.

35:13.405 --> 35:15.324
This is Jerry Mulligan.
Jerry, the Jansens.

35:15.575 --> 35:16.701
How do you do?

35:16.951 --> 35:21.247
Isn't this the chap you
told me about at lunch?

35:21.497 --> 35:23.791
Waiter, two more glasses, please.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.918
Milo says you're quite wonderful.

35:26.168 --> 35:27.712
I'd love to see
some of your pictures.

35:27.962 --> 35:31.299
I'm having a private showing
tomorrow on a corner in Montmartre.

35:31.549 --> 35:32.885
You paint?

35:33.135 --> 35:35.554
So do we. Jack and I.
We work together.

35:35.804 --> 35:36.972
Well, that's cozy.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.892
Dance, you two.
I want to talk to Milo.

35:40.142 --> 35:41.894
Come on, Jack.

35:42.144 --> 35:44.396
Have fun.

35:44.646 --> 35:48.442
There's a special doll over there.
Do you know who she is?

35:48.692 --> 35:51.571
No. But she is lovely,
isn't she?

35:51.821 --> 35:53.239
She sure is.

35:53.489 --> 35:55.742
I'm very anxious
for you to see Jerry's work.

35:55.992 --> 35:58.286
If you like it, you can get
him a mention on the art page.

35:58.536 --> 35:59.704
Nothing to it.

35:59.954 --> 36:01.247
- Lise.
- What?

36:01.497 --> 36:04.167
Her name is Lise.

36:04.417 --> 36:08.881
Let's dance.
We haven't for years.

36:09.381 --> 36:12.259
Excuse me, Jerry.

36:21.602 --> 36:23.729
You're going to have trouble
with that one.

36:23.979 --> 36:27.484
No, I'm not.
He's just not housebroken yet.

36:27.734 --> 36:30.237
When will you stop involving
yourself with young artists?

36:30.487 --> 36:31.947
It never works.

36:32.197 --> 36:34.866
If they're no good, you're ashamed.
If they are, they get too independent.

36:35.116 --> 36:36.743
Just dance, Tommy, please.

36:36.993 --> 36:39.079
All right. But I warn you,
he'll be out in four months...

36:39.329 --> 36:43.125
...just like the composer
and the sculptor.

37:01.144 --> 37:03.480
Lise! I didn't
see you sitting here!

37:03.730 --> 37:05.148
What a pleasant surprise!

37:05.399 --> 37:07.359
My wife and I were talking...

37:07.609 --> 37:09.903
...and were wondering
what happened to her.

37:10.153 --> 37:14.449
Let's go around the floor
for old time's sake. Do you mind?

37:18.037 --> 37:20.081
You're certainly not
without your nerve!

37:20.331 --> 37:23.376
Don't get angry.
This was perfectly harmless.

37:23.626 --> 37:27.213
I haven't been able to take
my eyes off you since I walked in.

37:27.463 --> 37:30.258
I only let you do this because
I didn't want a disturbance.

37:30.508 --> 37:31.926
And I don't have a wife.

37:32.176 --> 37:34.388
I threw that in to
make it look respectable.

37:34.638 --> 37:36.473
That was very considerate.

37:36.724 --> 37:39.143
Please, I would like to
return to my table.

37:39.393 --> 37:42.146
In a minute.

37:55.619 --> 37:57.078
I revise my estimate.

37:57.329 --> 38:00.498
Make that two months.

38:04.794 --> 38:07.631
This is the first time
I've done anything like this.

38:07.881 --> 38:11.761
At least as a civilian.
I just had to meet you.

38:12.011 --> 38:15.181
I don't know what type of girl
you think I am, but I'm not!

38:15.431 --> 38:18.017
And now I would like
to return to my friends.

38:18.267 --> 38:21.020
I thought you were bored with them.
You sure looked it.

38:21.270 --> 38:24.398
You should see me now.

38:26.485 --> 38:28.779
The music has stopped.

38:29.029 --> 38:32.574
The elements are against me.

38:32.908 --> 38:36.453
It was swell seeing you again.
I'll tell Elaine to call you.

38:36.703 --> 38:38.372
What was your phone number?

38:38.622 --> 38:40.666
It slipped my mind
the moment you said it.

38:40.916 --> 38:42.876
Opera 2-5-7-4.

38:43.126 --> 38:46.839
No, Lise. 2-4-7-5.

38:47.090 --> 38:49.842
Thank you.

38:49.968 --> 38:52.762
Good night.

39:01.564 --> 39:03.482
Well, I'm tired.
Good night.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.317
Good night, darling.
I'll call you.

39:05.568 --> 39:06.777
Say good night to Milo.

39:07.027 --> 39:08.445
- Good night, Milo.
- Good night, Jack.

39:08.696 --> 39:10.197
Don't I owe you something
for the wine?

39:10.447 --> 39:13.450
Forget it. You do it next time.
If there is one.

39:13.701 --> 39:15.703
Good night.

39:15.953 --> 39:18.873
Good night.

39:26.339 --> 39:28.091
- That was fun, wasn't it?
- Was it?

39:28.341 --> 39:30.176
That's a fascinating place.

39:30.427 --> 39:32.178
I'd like to hang around
and paint it.

39:32.429 --> 39:34.514
I can imagine
all the work you'll get done.

39:34.764 --> 39:36.475
You've already painted
a Montmartre dive...

39:36.726 --> 39:38.728
...and it wasn't successful.
- Wait a minute.

39:38.978 --> 39:40.855
Don't tell me how
and what to paint.

39:41.105 --> 39:43.357
I didn't like
your exhibition tonight!

39:43.608 --> 39:44.692
I thought you were very rude.

39:44.942 --> 39:47.361
Rude? I didn't mean
to be. I'm sorry.

39:47.612 --> 39:49.322
Picking up stray women
is your own affair...

39:49.572 --> 39:52.199
...but don't do it with me.
Is that clear?

39:52.450 --> 39:54.953
That's clear. That's very clear.
Stop the car.

39:55.203 --> 39:57.748
Sensitive artists!
You're touchy about yourself...

39:57.998 --> 39:59.458
...but oblivious of others.

39:59.708 --> 40:01.501
You don't understand
how they feel.

40:01.752 --> 40:02.961
It's been fun.

40:03.211 --> 40:04.713
Sorry you're stuck
with the pictures.

40:04.963 --> 40:09.176
- I still like the pictures.
- Thanks a lot.

40:24.234 --> 40:26.527
Jerry Mulligan.

40:26.778 --> 40:29.823
I met you at the Cafรฉ Flodair
last night. Remember?

40:30.074 --> 40:31.450
You!

40:31.700 --> 40:33.077
Yeah, me.

40:33.327 --> 40:36.538
It's a beautiful day and I thought
I could drop by and...

40:36.789 --> 40:39.875
Well, now, one moment, Mr. Mooligan.

40:40.125 --> 40:41.168
Mulligan.

40:41.418 --> 40:42.962
Last night you were an annoyance.

40:43.212 --> 40:45.257
But today you're growing
into a nuisance.

40:45.507 --> 40:50.512
Now please leave me alone and don't
call me again, ever.

41:18.916 --> 41:21.128
Good morning.

41:21.378 --> 41:23.171
Good morning.

41:23.422 --> 41:24.506
Would you care for...

41:24.756 --> 41:27.175
No, thanks.
I've had my breakfast already.

41:27.426 --> 41:29.136
I've been up for hours...

41:29.386 --> 41:31.513
...working, I might add, for you.

41:31.763 --> 41:33.724
Do you know Jules Parmentier,
the art dealer?

41:33.974 --> 41:34.933
I know of him.

41:35.183 --> 41:39.439
He came to the hotel
and had coffee this morning.

41:39.522 --> 41:42.191
I showed him your pictures.
He was very impressed.

41:42.442 --> 41:44.569
He thought you
had great individuality.

41:44.819 --> 41:46.195
He thought they were fresh.

41:46.446 --> 41:48.031
- That's wonderful.
- Not only that...

41:48.281 --> 41:50.241
...but he wants to talk
about your show.

41:50.491 --> 41:52.952
- That's a long way off.
- Maybe not such a long way.

41:53.202 --> 41:55.331
I don't have near enough
for an exhibition.

41:55.581 --> 41:58.208
- What I do have, I'm not sure...
- That's not important.

41:58.459 --> 42:01.670
Then I went to the Marais Galleries
and talked to Louis Dufond.

42:01.921 --> 42:03.464
He's a very old friend of mine.

42:03.714 --> 42:07.092
He's coming tomorrow
to see your pictures.

42:07.343 --> 42:11.680
You don't waste any time, do you?

42:12.390 --> 42:15.352
I hope not.

42:15.977 --> 42:19.189
Come with me and we'll
talk about it over lunch?

42:19.439 --> 42:22.108
I've something to do
this morning...

42:22.359 --> 42:23.818
...but I could meet you.

42:24.069 --> 42:27.072
How about the Restaurant Paul
on the Avenue de la Paix?

42:27.322 --> 42:30.660
I'll see you there at one.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.789
I'm sorry about that
little tiff last night.

42:35.039 --> 42:37.917
I was tired I guess.

42:38.167 --> 42:39.919
Forget it.

42:40.169 --> 42:44.507
- I did.
- You did? That's not very nice of you.

42:44.757 --> 42:47.636
See you at one.

43:02.985 --> 43:06.531
Very nice for a summer perfume.

43:10.868 --> 43:12.453
This is a little heavy.

43:12.704 --> 43:14.706
I'll show you something else.

43:14.956 --> 43:17.041
What's that one on the right?

43:17.292 --> 43:21.170
- This one?
- No, the other.

43:22.047 --> 43:25.259
This is very nice.
It's called...

43:25.509 --> 43:27.886
It's called Escapade.

43:28.137 --> 43:31.682
There's a saleslady free at the
other end of the shop, "monsieur".

43:31.932 --> 43:34.560
Thank you, but what I want
is at this end.

43:34.810 --> 43:38.689
I don't know which to choose.
They're both lovely.

43:38.940 --> 43:40.900
I wish my husband were here.

43:41.151 --> 43:43.486
He's so fussy about the way I smell.

43:43.737 --> 43:46.489
Why don't you bring him later
and decide then?

43:46.740 --> 43:48.033
That's an excellent idea.

43:48.283 --> 43:50.535
He's in Milwaukee.

43:50.785 --> 43:53.496
Dear, oh, dear.
I hate decisions.

43:53.747 --> 43:56.834
I always get a rash if I
have to decide something.

43:57.084 --> 43:58.544
Let me help you.

43:58.794 --> 44:00.630
I'd have the man's point of view.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.007
Yes, that's a good idea. Here.

44:03.257 --> 44:06.636
See which one you like.

44:07.637 --> 44:10.389
Not bad.

44:12.016 --> 44:13.142
This is it.

44:13.392 --> 44:15.270
"Nuit d'Amour." Night of Love.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.397
- No contest, lady.
- Really?

44:17.648 --> 44:21.443
Wear that and the Frenchmen will
never let you go back to Milwaukee.

44:21.693 --> 44:22.945
I'll take it.

44:23.195 --> 44:25.656
Would you send it to my hotel,
collect?

44:25.906 --> 44:30.285
I'm Mrs. Edna Mae Benstrom.
I'm at the Granville.

44:30.535 --> 44:32.038
Here's my card.

44:32.288 --> 44:33.414
Thank you.

44:33.665 --> 44:36.626
I think I'll put a little on.

44:36.876 --> 44:38.628
It is good, isn't it?

44:38.878 --> 44:40.338
You'll need protection.

44:40.588 --> 44:42.423
I hope so.

44:42.674 --> 44:45.093
You've been very kind.
Thank you.

44:45.343 --> 44:47.136
Thank you both. Good day.

44:47.387 --> 44:48.973
Good day.

44:49.223 --> 44:51.308
Now, "monsieur", what
can I do for you?

44:51.558 --> 44:54.228
You know what you can do
for me. Go out with me.

44:54.478 --> 44:55.938
How do you know I'm not married?

44:56.188 --> 44:59.942
That finger on your left
hand is awfully naked.

45:00.192 --> 45:02.987
It's a pity you don't have as much
charm as persistence.

45:03.237 --> 45:05.531
I do. You've only seen
my aggressive side.

45:05.782 --> 45:08.159
I have a lighter side.
I'm loaded with charm.

45:08.410 --> 45:11.496
I go to parties, put on hats
and do funny things.

45:11.746 --> 45:15.292
You see? What do you say?
Come on.

45:15.542 --> 45:18.169
All right. You win.

45:18.420 --> 45:20.338
You can take me for lunch.

45:20.589 --> 45:23.217
I can't. How about dinner?

45:23.467 --> 45:24.844
No. That's not possible.

45:25.094 --> 45:26.554
You have a date?

45:26.804 --> 45:31.642
What about after dinner?
Say, nine o'clock?

45:32.226 --> 45:33.936
I guess it would be all right.

45:34.186 --> 45:38.065
- I'll pick you up.
- No. I'll meet you somewhere.

45:38.316 --> 45:40.067
Do you know the Cafรฉ Bel-Ami?

45:40.318 --> 45:41.653
By the bridge?

45:41.903 --> 45:46.158
- I'll see you there at nine.
- Fine.

45:46.783 --> 45:50.037
There is no happier man in Paris
than "Monsieur" Mulligan.

45:50.287 --> 45:53.206
At this moment.

46:07.388 --> 46:11.142
Madame, you're delicious!

46:32.581 --> 46:37.087
One's company, two's a crowd.
You get it?

46:42.175 --> 46:43.969
Disappear!
Don't you see I'm busy?

46:44.219 --> 46:47.347
Hit the boulevard!

48:37.923 --> 48:41.009
Look! One hand.

50:11.730 --> 50:13.482
Hello. What's new?

50:13.732 --> 50:14.900
Who is this?

50:15.150 --> 50:16.944
- Guess.
- Oh, Adam!

50:17.194 --> 50:19.614
You always call at the wrong moment.

50:19.864 --> 50:23.117
Wrong moment? You make me feel
like a rejected child.

50:23.368 --> 50:25.453
When's the new number
going into the show?

50:25.703 --> 50:27.497
The new number goes in tonight.

50:27.747 --> 50:29.332
What? Tonight, Henri?

50:29.582 --> 50:31.084
Yes, darling, tonight.

50:31.334 --> 50:33.628
Are you having a party?
Need an extra man?

50:33.878 --> 50:36.757
No, I was talking to Lise,
my dinner guest.

50:37.007 --> 50:39.510
Give me a rundown on that menu.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.178
What're you having to eat?

50:41.428 --> 50:43.138
Magnificent pheasant.

50:43.389 --> 50:45.891
I can drop everything
and be up in ten minutes.

50:46.141 --> 50:47.935
That is, if I'm not intruding.

50:48.185 --> 50:52.398
No, no. I see you later at the cafe.
Goodbye.

50:52.648 --> 50:54.943
I'm hungry.

50:55.193 --> 50:57.112
That Adam.
He'll never change.

50:57.362 --> 51:00.365
What's the matter, darling?
Can't you come tonight?

51:00.615 --> 51:02.993
If you can't,
it's all right, darling.

51:03.243 --> 51:04.244
Don't worry.

51:04.494 --> 51:09.249
- No. Of course, I want to come.
- You are a doll.

51:26.726 --> 51:29.021
Would you...

51:29.271 --> 51:32.274
Yes, thank you.

51:33.734 --> 51:35.402
I wasn't sure you'd come.

51:35.652 --> 51:38.405
I thought maybe you said yes
to get rid of me.

51:38.655 --> 51:41.408
Not that it would have.

51:41.658 --> 51:44.911
What would you like?

51:46.039 --> 51:48.791
Would you mind if we didn't sit here?

51:49.042 --> 51:53.129
- Why, no.
- Anything wrong, "monsieur"?

51:58.509 --> 51:59.636
I'm sorry.

51:59.886 --> 52:04.975
That's all right. I didn't feel
like sitting there anyhow.

52:11.607 --> 52:13.275
Let's walk along the river.

52:13.525 --> 52:16.153
All right.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.669
I have a big thing for this spot.

52:30.919 --> 52:32.754
One of these days
I'll paint it.

52:33.004 --> 52:35.340
You're a painter?

52:35.590 --> 52:37.342
You don't look like a painter.

52:37.593 --> 52:40.346
There are those who'll say
I don't paint like one either.

52:40.596 --> 52:43.849
But that doesn't bother me.
Discouragement stimulates me.

52:44.100 --> 52:46.852
That much about you, I know.

52:47.103 --> 52:48.854
Yes, you do, don't you?

52:49.105 --> 52:51.148
But mark me well,
one of these days...

52:51.399 --> 52:54.026
...the world will ring
with the name Mulligan.

52:54.277 --> 52:57.447
Picasso will be remembered
as the forerunner of Mulligan.

52:57.698 --> 53:02.077
This tree will be famous because
it was painted by Mulligan.

53:02.327 --> 53:05.163
And when will this
golden age of art be?

53:05.414 --> 53:08.375
Well, it's hard to say.
It's hard to say.

53:08.625 --> 53:13.756
Civilization has a natural resistance
against improving itself.

53:14.007 --> 53:15.717
It might take quite a while.

53:15.967 --> 53:19.220
Quite a while.

53:23.308 --> 53:25.685
- How do you feel now?
- Why?

53:25.935 --> 53:29.230
A moment ago you were acting like
the police were after you.

53:29.480 --> 53:31.734
I was, wasn't I?

53:31.984 --> 53:33.986
Why?

53:34.236 --> 53:36.071
No. Never mind, never mind.

53:36.322 --> 53:38.741
Don't try to think up
what to tell me.

53:38.991 --> 53:43.412
I don't have to know.
It's your business.

53:43.495 --> 53:45.893
Candy. Would you like some?

53:45.928 --> 53:48.293
I couldn't eat a whole one.

53:48.543 --> 53:51.171
Go ahead. Try.

53:51.421 --> 53:54.257
The night's young.

53:54.507 --> 53:58.053
We should live dangerously.

54:13.152 --> 54:15.905
Tell me some more.

54:16.224 --> 54:18.184
Well...

54:18.435 --> 54:21.521
...in America,
Saturday night's the big night.

54:21.771 --> 54:24.107
No work, no school...

54:24.357 --> 54:27.861
...when you get home, no money.

54:28.319 --> 54:31.073
And Sunday?
Is Sunday nice in America?

54:31.323 --> 54:35.036
In America, everybody
catches cold on Sunday.

54:35.286 --> 54:39.206
- Did you?
- Well, sometimes. Sometimes.

54:39.457 --> 54:43.419
What about you? Aren't you sick
of the life and times of Mulligan?

54:43.669 --> 54:47.631
I'd rather listen to you.
I don't like to talk about myself.

54:47.882 --> 54:50.760
- You'll have to get over that.
- Why?

54:51.010 --> 54:53.012
With a binding like you've got...

54:53.262 --> 54:55.807
...people will want
to know what's in the book.

54:56.058 --> 54:57.392
What does that mean?

54:57.642 --> 55:00.896
Well, primarily, it means
you're a very pretty girl.

55:01.146 --> 55:03.523
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

55:03.774 --> 55:05.108
How do you know?

55:05.359 --> 55:08.236
I heard it on the radio.

55:08.487 --> 55:10.238
Making fun with me.

55:10.489 --> 55:13.200
Doesn't everybody tell you that?

55:13.450 --> 55:15.452
I haven't been out with many people.

55:15.702 --> 55:17.079
And always friends.

55:17.329 --> 55:21.292
Honey, believe me, I'm no enemy.

55:33.221 --> 55:35.723
I don't know if you're
a girl of mystery...

55:35.973 --> 55:39.060
...or just a still water
that doesn't run deep...

55:39.310 --> 55:41.729
...but there's one
thing I can tell you.

55:41.979 --> 55:44.775
If I'd been around sooner,
you'd know by now that...

55:45.025 --> 55:46.777
...you're very pretty.

55:47.027 --> 55:51.073
And I'm not making fun with you.

59:45.949 --> 59:47.993
- What time is it?
- Eleven o'clock.

59:48.243 --> 59:50.287
- Eleven! I have to go.
- Where?

59:50.537 --> 59:52.915
- When will I see you again?
- I don't know.

59:53.166 --> 59:56.711
Lise, we have to
see each other again.

59:56.961 --> 59:59.172
Yes, we do, don't we?

59:59.422 --> 01:00:00.423
Tomorrow night.

01:00:00.673 --> 01:00:03.843
- No, I can't. How about lunch?
- No. I can't.

01:00:04.093 --> 01:00:06.429
Saturday morning I'm at
the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.

01:00:06.679 --> 01:00:11.726
- I'm finished at noon. Meet me there?
- Saturday. Yes, I will.

01:00:43.384 --> 01:00:46.471
How are you?

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:08.034
I am delighted.
It's a wonderful idea.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.327
I'm so sorry.

01:03:09.578 --> 01:03:11.038
Lise, I have wonderful news.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:14.166
This, I take it, is the young
lady who'll do all the deciding.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.417
That's right.

01:03:15.668 --> 01:03:18.504
This is John MacDowd,
my favorite American impresario.

01:03:18.754 --> 01:03:20.464
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:23.050
I've been trying to persuade Henri
to come to America...

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.593
...and give us Yanks a break.

01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:26.595
He says he has to
talk it over with you.

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:28.722
You make him do it, Miss Lise.

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:31.684
- I'll call you in a few days.
- That's all right.

01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:35.981
And may I say, your Lise certainly
lives up to your advertisements.

01:03:36.231 --> 01:03:38.942
Thank you, Johnny.
Good night.

01:03:39.192 --> 01:03:42.237
- I'm sorry, but the movie...
- Never mind the movie.

01:03:42.487 --> 01:03:44.072
What do think of the news?

01:03:44.322 --> 01:03:46.950
John wants me to go
on an American tour.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.411
We could get married
and go together.

01:03:49.661 --> 01:03:53.373
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

01:03:53.665 --> 01:03:55.625
- When would you go?
- Not for a few weeks.

01:03:55.876 --> 01:03:58.003
John will have to
see first about bookings.

01:03:58.253 --> 01:04:00.047
But it could be beautiful.

01:04:00.298 --> 01:04:01.841
A honeymoon on the boat...

01:04:02.091 --> 01:04:04.927
...then America.

01:04:05.178 --> 01:04:08.890
You'll love the Americans.

01:04:27.701 --> 01:04:30.787
- Your limousine is here, sir.
- Thanks.

01:04:31.038 --> 01:04:32.956
This sponsor of yours...

01:04:33.207 --> 01:04:35.626
...what does she want
from you in return?

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:39.213
-Don't tell me. I shock easily.
-You're crazy. She isn't interested in me.

01:04:39.463 --> 01:04:42.966
She's just a goodhearted kid
who likes the way I paint.

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:45.385
That's real dreamy of her.

01:04:45.636 --> 01:04:47.513
Tell me, when you get married...

01:04:47.763 --> 01:04:51.392
...will you keep your maiden name?

01:05:00.527 --> 01:05:02.445
Hello, Therese.

01:05:02.695 --> 01:05:05.615
"Monsieur" Jerry, don't pay
any attention to Monsieur Cook.

01:05:05.865 --> 01:05:06.825
I don't intend to.

01:05:07.075 --> 01:05:08.910
Suppose you do have to make
love to the lady?

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.328
It's all for the sake of art.

01:05:10.578 --> 01:05:13.833
I don't have to make love...

01:10:04.176 --> 01:10:06.970
Bravo!

01:10:10.182 --> 01:10:11.642
Colossal! Encore!

01:10:11.893 --> 01:10:17.356
Encore! "Magnifique"! Bravo!

01:10:41.632 --> 01:10:42.925
Who are we seeing here?

01:10:43.175 --> 01:10:46.887
Never you mind.
Wait and see.

01:11:08.535 --> 01:11:10.161
What is all this?

01:11:10.411 --> 01:11:12.705
Your studio.
Isn't it beautiful?

01:11:12.956 --> 01:11:14.332
I've got a studio.

01:11:14.582 --> 01:11:17.752
Well, yes, I know, Jerry,
but you need space.

01:11:18.002 --> 01:11:20.296
This isn't to live in,
it's to work in.

01:11:20.547 --> 01:11:23.174
I can't afford a joint like this.

01:11:23.424 --> 01:11:25.469
Why do you make
such an issue of money?

01:11:25.719 --> 01:11:27.137
Because I ain't got any...

01:11:27.388 --> 01:11:30.975
...and when you ain't got any,
it takes on a curious significance.

01:11:31.225 --> 01:11:33.686
Don't be silly.
You'll be able to pay me back.

01:11:33.936 --> 01:11:35.396
In three months.

01:11:35.646 --> 01:11:37.356
Three months?
What do you mean?

01:11:37.606 --> 01:11:38.649
That's the real surprise.

01:11:38.899 --> 01:11:41.569
Your exhibition at
the Parmentier Galleries.

01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:43.404
My exhibition in three months?

01:11:43.654 --> 01:11:45.573
Already they're
arranging posters...

01:11:45.823 --> 01:11:47.408
Wait a minute, hold everything.

01:11:47.658 --> 01:11:50.871
Sit down and let's see
if I can explain this to you.

01:11:51.121 --> 01:11:54.040
More than anything,
I want to have an exhibition.

01:11:54.291 --> 01:11:55.834
But when I'm ready.

01:11:56.084 --> 01:11:58.920
When my stuff is good enough
to show to the public and critics.

01:11:59.171 --> 01:12:02.007
You can't set a production date
for a thing like that.

01:12:02.257 --> 01:12:05.051
Don't you understand?
I'm not manufacturing paper cups.

01:12:05.302 --> 01:12:07.220
I do understand, Jerry.

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:10.891
But you're a painter and you want
people to see what you've painted.

01:12:11.141 --> 01:12:13.185
I want that too.

01:12:13.435 --> 01:12:17.732
Give me an opportunity to provide
a decent show at a decent gallery...

01:12:17.982 --> 01:12:20.485
...where people can see your things.

01:12:20.735 --> 01:12:22.904
Is that so extraordinary?

01:12:23.154 --> 01:12:26.032
Look, you're a painter
and a good one.

01:12:26.282 --> 01:12:28.576
I happen to have a little drive.

01:12:28.826 --> 01:12:31.078
That's a good combination.

01:12:31.329 --> 01:12:34.749
Besides, you have to
face the critics sometime.

01:12:34.999 --> 01:12:39.086
Yeah, but three months.

01:12:39.838 --> 01:12:42.216
Of course, it'll be work.
Hard work.

01:12:42.466 --> 01:12:45.719
That doesn't matter.

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:53.644
I'll do it.
On one condition.

01:12:53.894 --> 01:12:56.396
I pay you back.

01:12:56.647 --> 01:12:58.690
Jerry, I'm so glad.

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:02.986
I would have died if you'd said no.

01:14:40.129 --> 01:14:42.548
- Did you think I wasn't coming?
- No, I thought you would.

01:14:42.798 --> 01:14:46.595
Let's take a cab over to the Bois.

01:14:58.065 --> 01:14:59.858
I want to drop my stuff off.

01:15:00.108 --> 01:15:03.362
- When do you have to be back?
- In an hour or so.

01:15:03.612 --> 01:15:05.197
That's not much time.

01:15:05.447 --> 01:15:07.950
What kept you?
Why were you so late?

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.119
Well, I...

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.915
I wanted to tell you, Jerry...

01:15:14.165 --> 01:15:16.918
What?

01:15:17.627 --> 01:15:21.422
We have so little time together.
Can't we have our own world...

01:15:21.673 --> 01:15:26.302
...and not talk about anything
that happens when we're apart?

01:15:26.553 --> 01:15:30.723
I promise I'll never ask
what you do when you're not with me.

01:15:30.974 --> 01:15:33.101
Well, I suppose it's just as well.

01:15:33.352 --> 01:15:35.855
- What?
- Nothing.

01:15:36.105 --> 01:15:39.441
Why? What do you do
when you're not with me?

01:15:39.692 --> 01:15:42.069
If you don't want to
talk about it, okay.

01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:45.781
Let's let it go at that.

01:15:49.535 --> 01:15:52.955
Kiss me.

01:15:57.585 --> 01:15:59.921
- Why are we stopping here?
- I live here.

01:16:00.172 --> 01:16:04.676
- No, Jerry, let's go on...
- I want to leave my things.

01:16:04.718 --> 01:16:06.219
I'll be back in a minute.

01:16:06.469 --> 01:16:07.470
Hi, kid.

01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:09.264
- What's your rush?
- Busy, busy.

01:16:09.514 --> 01:16:13.393
Have Therese put these in my room.

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.271
Sit down.
Have some coffee.

01:16:16.521 --> 01:16:21.067
I've got someone waiting
in a cab. See you later.

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:28.784
Have some coffee.
You have time now.

01:16:29.035 --> 01:16:30.578
Georges, two coffees.

01:16:30.828 --> 01:16:34.540
- "Bonjour", Jerry, Adam.
- Hi, kid.

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:43.216
So your exhibition's
set for next month?

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:44.509
Why so glum?

01:16:44.759 --> 01:16:46.761
- Woman trouble.
- Proves you're a man.

01:16:47.011 --> 01:16:50.140
That was her in the cab.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.861
I told you this sponsoring business
was complicated.

01:17:03.111 --> 01:17:06.031
Women act like men
and want to be treated like women.

01:17:06.281 --> 01:17:07.407
What are you talking about?

01:17:07.658 --> 01:17:09.827
That girl in the cab.
The suntan queen.

01:17:10.077 --> 01:17:12.246
No. That's a different girl.

01:17:12.497 --> 01:17:15.792
You're a busy little man these days.

01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:17.669
I'm hooked.

01:17:17.919 --> 01:17:19.587
That girl's it.

01:17:19.838 --> 01:17:22.131
Is she worthy of
a struggling young artist?

01:17:22.382 --> 01:17:25.593
She's worthy of anyone.
She's wonderful.

01:17:25.844 --> 01:17:28.847
What gets me is,
I don't know anything about her.

01:17:29.097 --> 01:17:33.226
We manage to be together for a few
moments and then off she goes.

01:17:33.476 --> 01:17:35.937
Sometimes we have
a wonderful time together.

01:17:36.187 --> 01:17:39.024
Other times it's no fun at all...

01:17:39.275 --> 01:17:41.569
...but I got to be with her.

01:17:41.819 --> 01:17:44.905
Yep. You're hooked.

01:17:45.239 --> 01:17:49.410
- What's her name?
- Lise Bouvier.

01:17:50.077 --> 01:17:52.371
Georges, some brandy.

01:17:52.621 --> 01:17:55.958
And some cleaning fluid.

01:17:59.044 --> 01:18:01.964
- Hi, Hank.
- Jerry. Adam. May I sit down?

01:18:02.215 --> 01:18:03.425
- My guest.
- Thank you.

01:18:03.675 --> 01:18:05.010
Georges, a little sherry.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.054
Adam, I have wonderful news.
Wonderful news.

01:18:08.305 --> 01:18:10.473
That's great.
Tell us something cheery.

01:18:10.724 --> 01:18:13.643
- I'm going to be married.
- You're what?

01:18:13.894 --> 01:18:17.647
We're getting married and going
to America on our honeymoon.

01:18:17.898 --> 01:18:20.275
Another brandy.
When was this decided?

01:18:20.525 --> 01:18:21.943
- Last night.
- Congratulations, Hank.

01:18:22.194 --> 01:18:23.695
I'm glad somebody's happy.

01:18:23.945 --> 01:18:25.822
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:18:26.072 --> 01:18:27.116
Maybe I can help.

01:18:27.366 --> 01:18:30.494
Did I ever tell you about
the time I performed for Hitler?

01:18:30.745 --> 01:18:33.664
Wait. Jerry has some problem,
and I'd like to hear about it.

01:18:33.915 --> 01:18:36.501
It's pretty complicated.
I'll make it brief.

01:18:36.751 --> 01:18:38.544
There's a gal who's sponsoring me...

01:18:38.794 --> 01:18:40.379
...and she's really
helping me a lot, but...

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:42.507
She's stuck on me.

01:18:42.757 --> 01:18:44.133
There's a girl I'm stuck on.

01:18:44.383 --> 01:18:45.635
She doesn't know about the first one.

01:18:45.885 --> 01:18:48.054
Naturally.
So far this is very ordinary.

01:18:48.304 --> 01:18:49.680
- So far.
- Now wait.

01:18:49.931 --> 01:18:52.434
The girl I'm stuck on has
something she can't tell me.

01:18:52.684 --> 01:18:56.063
So we go out together
and go out together and get nowhere.

01:18:56.313 --> 01:18:57.689
Let me ask you something.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:01.360
Is this girl, as you say,
stuck on you?

01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:04.488
- I think so.
- Then you have no problems.

01:19:04.738 --> 01:19:05.739
Where'd they go?

01:19:05.989 --> 01:19:08.075
- No problems?
- Of course not.

01:19:08.325 --> 01:19:10.869
There's only one problem with
a man and a woman.

01:19:11.119 --> 01:19:13.831
When one of them's in love
and the other isn't.

01:19:14.081 --> 01:19:15.874
After that, it's all mechanics.

01:19:16.124 --> 01:19:18.837
Have you told her you love her?

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:20.588
No, not in so many words.

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:23.633
When you don't know what goes,
you're afraid to get hurt.

01:19:23.883 --> 01:19:25.885
The first thing to do
is to tell her.

01:19:26.135 --> 01:19:28.388
Believe me, Jerry, with a woman...

01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:31.099
...one insincere "I love you"
that's said...

01:19:31.349 --> 01:19:34.978
...will bring more results than ten
sincere ones that aren't.

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:37.355
So go to her and tell her
you love her.

01:19:37.605 --> 01:19:39.315
Then she'll tell you she loves you.

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:41.235
Then you will embrace.

01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:43.237
You will both be very happy.

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:46.365
And then you will ask
her to marry you.

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.909
- You want to, don't you?
- Sure. Sure.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:51.412
Good. Then she will say yes...

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:54.915
...and then you will tell her
about these other little matters...

01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:56.709
...and she will tell you about hers.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:59.753
And you'll see.
They won't seem important anymore.

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:01.422
Is it as simple as that?

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:03.841
Strange as it seems, yes.
So be happy.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:06.845
- You only find the right woman once.
- That many times?

01:20:07.095 --> 01:20:09.347
- When will you be with her?
- In a little while.

01:20:09.598 --> 01:20:11.099
So you know what to do?

01:20:11.349 --> 01:20:13.685
- I'll do it. Thanks.
- Good.

01:20:13.935 --> 01:20:16.271
Adam, to be in love is to be alive.

01:20:16.521 --> 01:20:18.398
Jerry and I, we are so lucky,
eh, Jerry?

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:22.360
He's right.
There's nothing like it.

01:23:34.644 --> 01:23:37.730
I have something to tell you.

01:23:37.981 --> 01:23:40.400
I have something to tell you.

01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:41.651
I love you.

01:23:41.901 --> 01:23:47.115
I love you and everything's
going to be all right! I know it is.

01:23:48.825 --> 01:23:50.536
I won't see you anymore.

01:23:50.786 --> 01:23:53.581
What do you mean?

01:23:54.039 --> 01:23:55.666
I'm getting married.

01:23:55.916 --> 01:23:58.836
You're getting...

01:23:59.837 --> 01:24:02.798
You're in love with me,
aren't you?

01:24:03.048 --> 01:24:05.342
It doesn't matter
whether I am or not.

01:24:05.593 --> 01:24:08.345
It doesn't matter?

01:24:08.596 --> 01:24:10.556
I couldn't leave him.

01:24:10.806 --> 01:24:15.854
- Who?
- His name is Henri Baurel.

01:24:19.107 --> 01:24:22.611
I practically owe him
my life, Jerry.

01:24:22.861 --> 01:24:25.989
During the war, my parents
worked for the Resistance.

01:24:26.239 --> 01:24:29.034
I was so young,
they asked Henri to hide me...

01:24:29.284 --> 01:24:32.704
...and if he'd been caught,
it would have been the end of him.

01:24:32.954 --> 01:24:35.457
But for five years
he took care of me.

01:24:35.707 --> 01:24:37.250
He was all I had...

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.086
...and I loved him.

01:24:39.337 --> 01:24:43.007
And he grew to love me.
And now I...

01:24:43.257 --> 01:24:45.009
Jerry, I can't!

01:24:45.259 --> 01:24:48.638
You must understand.

01:24:49.096 --> 01:24:51.724
Sure.

01:24:51.974 --> 01:24:53.851
Well, it's okay.

01:24:54.101 --> 01:24:56.896
There's a woman who's
helping me a lot...

01:24:57.146 --> 01:25:00.566
...who means so much to me, I wouldn't
want to lose her for anything.

01:25:00.816 --> 01:25:04.655
My work's so important.

01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:09.743
Good luck.

01:25:17.251 --> 01:25:21.672
If it means anything to you,
I love you!

01:25:24.675 --> 01:25:27.678
Goodbye, Lise.

01:25:36.646 --> 01:25:37.689
What are you doing tonight?

01:25:37.939 --> 01:25:39.983
I was getting ready
for a dinner date.

01:25:40.233 --> 01:25:44.737
- How about breaking it?
- That'd be difficult.

01:25:45.697 --> 01:25:47.740
But not impossible.

01:25:47.991 --> 01:25:51.619
You know, some days you
look exceptionally pretty.

01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:53.289
Is this one of them?

01:25:53.539 --> 01:25:57.042
This is one of your best.

01:25:58.377 --> 01:26:01.755
This is one of your good days too.

01:26:02.006 --> 01:26:03.507
You and I are going out tonight.

01:26:03.757 --> 01:26:06.343
I'm taking you to the Art
Students Ball. Have you been?

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:09.555
It's jet-propelled New Year's Eve,
and all of Paris will be there.

01:26:09.805 --> 01:26:10.931
It's costume, isn't it?

01:26:11.182 --> 01:26:14.476
I'll take care of that.
Leave it to me. Tonight's my night.

01:26:14.727 --> 01:26:16.478
I feel like a woman for a change.

01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:18.315
You are.

01:26:18.565 --> 01:26:21.234
- Haven't I ever mentioned it to you?
- No.

01:26:21.484 --> 01:26:25.610
You will hear
a lot about it from now on.

01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:29.784
I'll be back soon.
I got to take care of everything.

01:26:46.677 --> 01:26:48.137
I want some champagne!

01:26:48.387 --> 01:26:50.640
So do I! They all seem
a bottle ahead of us!

01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:53.643
Come on!

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.476
Come on, let's get some champagne!

01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:43.945
- Are these parties always this wild?
- This is my first.

01:27:44.195 --> 01:27:45.655
Look at that costume.

01:27:45.905 --> 01:27:48.741
Jerry Mulligan, a buddy of mine,
made me come.

01:27:48.992 --> 01:27:50.827
- Thanks.
- To Jerry.

01:27:51.077 --> 01:27:52.704
May his name survive his folly.

01:27:52.954 --> 01:27:54.873
His folly? What's he doing?

01:27:55.123 --> 01:27:58.586
- He's giving a show. He's a painter.
- So what's wrong with that?

01:27:58.836 --> 01:28:01.964
- He'll get it in the neck.
- Then why does he do it?

01:28:02.214 --> 01:28:04.884
He's got a sponsor that's
got more nerve than cash.

01:28:05.134 --> 01:28:07.636
Well, Charmaine, this is farewell!

01:28:07.887 --> 01:28:10.764
Let's not say "au revoir".
Just goodbye forever.

01:28:11.015 --> 01:28:15.853
By the way, I think you might
like to know, I'm Jerry's sponsor.

01:28:16.103 --> 01:28:18.731
I know you are.

01:28:39.544 --> 01:28:40.962
The vanishing American!

01:28:41.213 --> 01:28:43.924
Finally! I met
a friend of yours just now.

01:28:44.174 --> 01:28:45.592
Who?

01:28:45.842 --> 01:28:47.470
Him. Who is he?

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.014
That's Adam Cook.
He's a concert pianist.

01:28:50.264 --> 01:28:51.933
That's funny.
I've never heard of him.

01:28:52.183 --> 01:28:56.395
It's not funny.
He's never given a concert.

01:29:00.024 --> 01:29:02.109
- What a pleasant surprise.
- For me too.

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.820
- Jerry, this is Lise.
- How do you do?

01:29:05.071 --> 01:29:06.447
And Miss Roberts.

01:29:06.697 --> 01:29:09.242
Milo, this is Henri Baurel
and fiancรฉe.

01:29:09.492 --> 01:29:11.912
This is our last night in Paris.

01:29:12.162 --> 01:29:14.790
We are driving to Le Havre
at dawn to get married.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.417
And then we leave for America.

01:29:17.668 --> 01:29:22.130
Well, that sounds
very romantic.

01:29:22.339 --> 01:29:23.715
Let's dance, Henri.

01:29:23.966 --> 01:29:25.008
Nice to have met you.

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:27.094
I'll see you later.

01:29:27.344 --> 01:29:29.805
That little advice I gave you
this afternoon.

01:29:30.055 --> 01:29:33.016
- It worked out fine?
- It worked out great.

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:35.894
Good!

01:29:38.022 --> 01:29:40.233
- Haven't I seen that girl before?
- I don't know.

01:29:40.483 --> 01:29:42.652
Her face seems very familiar.

01:29:42.902 --> 01:29:45.071
Quite a nice boy. He's a painter.

01:29:45.321 --> 01:29:48.324
A friend of Adam's.

01:29:49.534 --> 01:29:54.497
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Henri.

01:29:59.878 --> 01:30:01.463
Milo, I'm a fake.

01:30:01.714 --> 01:30:05.509
I'm not full of life and good spirits.
It's just the reverse.

01:30:05.759 --> 01:30:09.096
I shouldn't have
brought you tonight. I'm sorry.

01:30:09.346 --> 01:30:11.640
That girl.

01:30:11.891 --> 01:30:13.475
In the nightclub.

01:30:13.726 --> 01:30:16.729
I'm in love with her.

01:30:17.646 --> 01:30:21.358
I think I need some champagne.

01:31:33.684 --> 01:31:37.271
I didn't know you were
getting married so quickly.

01:31:37.521 --> 01:31:39.856
I couldn't tell you.

01:31:40.107 --> 01:31:44.863
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

01:31:45.572 --> 01:31:48.533
It's so dreadful
standing next to you like this...

01:31:48.783 --> 01:31:51.536
...and not having
your arms around me.

01:31:51.786 --> 01:31:56.124
You'll always be
standing next to me, Lise.

01:32:12.516 --> 01:32:14.560
Maybe not always.

01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:17.646
Paris has ways
of making people forget.

01:32:17.897 --> 01:32:22.985
Paris? No. Not this city.

01:32:23.235 --> 01:32:25.112
It's too real and too beautiful.

01:32:25.362 --> 01:32:27.781
Never lets you forget anything.

01:32:28.032 --> 01:32:30.869
Reaches in and opens you wide...

01:32:31.119 --> 01:32:33.163
...and you stay that way.

01:32:33.413 --> 01:32:35.332
I know.

01:32:35.582 --> 01:32:38.627
I came to Paris to study
and to paint it...

01:32:38.877 --> 01:32:42.589
...because Utrillo did
and Lautrec did and Rouault did.

01:32:42.839 --> 01:32:44.090
I loved what they created...

01:32:44.341 --> 01:32:47.344
...and I thought something
would happen to me too.

01:32:47.594 --> 01:32:50.055
It happened, all right.

01:32:50.305 --> 01:32:52.515
Now what have I got left?

01:32:52.766 --> 01:32:54.517
Paris.

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:58.397
Maybe that's enough for some,
but it isn't for me anymore.

01:32:58.648 --> 01:33:00.483
Because the more beautiful
everything is...

01:33:00.733 --> 01:33:04.320
...the more it'll hurt without you.

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:10.993
Don't let me leave you this way.
