WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.961
- Are you sure
he won't wake up?

00:04.045 --> 00:06.923
- Dad, I am pregnant!

00:08.717 --> 00:10.260
We're good.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.929
Okay, mouth is one point,
nostrils are each ten,

00:13.012 --> 00:14.848
and if he starts
choking, run.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.850
- Game on, sucker.

00:24.023 --> 00:26.568
- GABBY: I can't
believe you.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.945
- [door closes]
- What? What?

00:29.028 --> 00:31.781
Why was I dreaming
about a meteor shower?

00:31.865 --> 00:32.698
What?

00:32.782 --> 00:35.034
Oh. Oh. Oh.
What is happening here?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.703
- I'll tell you what
happened at the grocery store.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.122
Steph got a price
check on crazy.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.666
- Let me guess--she flipped out
in the 12-item express lane?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.293
- She's done this
with you, too?

00:43.376 --> 00:46.629
- I still get flashbacks!

00:46.713 --> 00:48.757
- Two cans of tuna
is one item.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.134
The one item is tuna.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.635
- You sound just
like your mother.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.014
- Are you trying to
hurt me, Charlie?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.932
- Yeah, I...I...just
meant that

00:58.016 --> 00:59.893
I've heard your mother
say the exact same thing.

00:59.976 --> 01:03.521
- Well, you're wrong.
I am nothing like my mother.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.900
- Hi! Hi! Hi!

01:06.983 --> 01:12.614
- Nobody say a word.

01:12.697 --> 01:13.907
- She best be going
upstairs to change

01:13.990 --> 01:17.202
'cause mama's
wearin' it better!

01:17.285 --> 01:24.375

{\an8}- Hi! Hi! Hi!

01:46.272 --> 01:48.024
{\an8}I need to borrow a dress.

01:48.107 --> 01:50.026
{\an8}One of those little
numbers you wear

01:50.109 --> 01:53.530
{\an8}that give away the form.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.781
{\an8}- Seriously?

01:54.864 --> 01:59.035
{\an8}Why would you want to borrow
something you can't handle?

01:59.118 --> 02:02.372
{\an8}- I need it for church.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.208
{\an8}Mama's trying to bag
herself a minister.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.711
{\an8}Reverend Crocker's divorce
has been finalized.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.505
{\an8}And I got competition.

02:10.588 --> 02:15.051
{\an8}A single minister's

02:15.134 --> 02:17.554
{\an8}- Don't you think you should
give him some time?

02:17.637 --> 02:19.138
{\an8}He just got divorced.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.431
{\an8}- How long was
Charlie divorced

02:20.515 --> 02:22.225
{\an8}before you two
started datin'?

02:22.308 --> 02:24.561
- You want shoes to
go with that dress?

02:24.644 --> 02:26.563
- Dana dumped me.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.732
- Aw, she did?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.568
- She made us take some dumb
compatibility test

02:31.651 --> 02:34.737
from some girlie website
and our score was low.

02:34.821 --> 02:35.947
- If you ask me, the test
did you a big old favor.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.575
- Yeah, these things
have a way of...

02:38.658 --> 02:42.245
- MAGGIE & STEPH: ...revealing
truths about people.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.913
- And Dana's truth was...

02:43.997 --> 02:48.418
- MAGGIE & STEPH: ...she was too
dumb to see what she had.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.087
- Did you guys rehearse that?

02:51.170 --> 02:53.256
- So, uh, what kind of questions
are on that test?

02:53.339 --> 02:57.760
- Okay, "it's fondue night with
your boo-boo bear."

02:57.844 --> 03:00.471
Ugh, gag me.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.807
These are
"chocolate or cheese?"

03:02.891 --> 03:07.145
- Well, when I'm dating,
I crave a little chocolate.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.480
Mm!

03:09.564 --> 03:13.443
- I wish I hadn't heard that,
but I'd also say chocolate.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.153
- Next question:

03:15.236 --> 03:17.447
"would you rather read
the book or see the movie?"

03:17.530 --> 03:18.781
- MAGGIE & STEPH:
Read the book.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.451
- I don't think this
test works if you lie.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.120
- MAGGIE & STEPH:
Tsk. See the movie.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.414
- Would you stop
answering like me!

03:26.497 --> 03:29.959
I'm doing the next
one secretly.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.420
Oh.

03:32.503 --> 03:33.963
- Okay, Grandma Maggie,
your turn.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.840
Would you rather snow ski
or water ski?

03:35.924 --> 03:40.470
- I don't do water, unh-unh.
I got hair.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.805
So I'm gonna have
to say snow ski.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.349
- Stop it!

03:44.432 --> 03:46.142
This stupid test is gonna say
we're a match made in Heaven.

03:46.225 --> 03:49.812
- Actually, it says you guys are
too alike to be a couple.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.152
- Guys, check it out.
Molly got a tattoo.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.821
- Oh, baby, why?

03:58.905 --> 04:01.741
- Cool, huh?
- Oh, is that a little goat?

04:01.824 --> 04:02.992
- Yeah, it's my sign.
I'm a Capricorn.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.828
Gabby, you know
what would be great

04:05.912 --> 04:08.331
is if you got your sign,
too, in the same spot.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.124
- MAGGIE & STEPH:
Ain't nobody gettin' a tattoo!

04:10.208 --> 04:12.502
- STEPH: [gasping]

04:12.585 --> 04:13.586
Where'd that come from?

04:13.670 --> 04:17.839
- Guys, chill. There's no
way I would ever do that.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.343
- I'm surprised you're so
against it, Mrs. Phillips.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.844
You have those ones
on your wrists.

04:21.928 --> 04:26.140
- Huh, I will never forget
when her sorry little

04:26.224 --> 04:34.232
17-year-old self waltzed into
my house with a tattoo.

04:34.315 --> 04:37.568
Talking about,
"it looks cool."

04:37.652 --> 04:40.655
It looked fool!

04:40.738 --> 04:44.367
If I ever had to get
a tattoo, it would say:

04:44.450 --> 04:48.496
"Don't bother readin' this
'cause it's stupid!"

04:51.833 --> 04:54.252
- I know James is bummed his
girlfriend dumped him.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.171
But it's like,
get over it already.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.048
- This from the girl who started
a letter writing campaign

04:59.132 --> 05:02.885
when the cute weatherman
moved to Pittsburgh?

05:02.969 --> 05:05.054
- Gabby and gentleman...

05:05.138 --> 05:07.223
He's the smoothest.
He's the coolest.

05:07.306 --> 05:10.351
He paid me three whole
bucks to do this.

05:10.435 --> 05:14.397
I give you James,
the champion of the ladies.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.734
- I am the greatest!

05:17.817 --> 05:19.736
- I guess he's over Dana.

05:19.819 --> 05:20.862
- The prettiest girl in
school likes me.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.781
She picked me to be her
new buds history partner.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.076
We're gonna make the Washington
Monument outta sugar cubes.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.620
She saw the mess I made last
year out of the Taj Mahal.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.289
So you know she ain't
in it for the grade.

05:31.372 --> 05:34.417
[laughing]
- Slow down, champ.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.252
Maybe we should meet
her parents first.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.795
- Oh, don't worry, Dad.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.089
If James can land her, she must
have a face like a knuckle.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.091
[laughing]

05:42.175 --> 05:44.469
So, what's
knuckle-face's name?

05:44.552 --> 05:45.762
- Erin.
- AARON: What?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.764
- No, Erin.
- AARON: Dude, what?

05:47.847 --> 05:50.475
- Erin, E-r-i-n.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.143
- That's not how
you spell my name.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.269
- Wow, that's creepy.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.438
It's like you're dating
your brother.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.816
- I am quite a catch.

05:58.900 --> 06:03.863
- A-a-r-o-n and E-r-i-n are not
even remotely the same person.

06:03.946 --> 06:06.365
Erin's into comic books,
video games--

06:06.449 --> 06:07.033
- And what does your
little girlfriend like?

06:07.116 --> 06:09.786
- I was talking about her.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.455
- Hi, guys.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.415
I've done it.
I've solved it.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.293
Look at this.
- GABBY: [gasping]

06:17.376 --> 06:19.545
- You ran out and got
a tattoo?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.005
- I am not my mama
anymore.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.008
Hey!

06:24.092 --> 06:25.927
- Kids, rooms.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.261
- Not a chance.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.639
- Yeah, we wanna see this.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.808
- Steph, that's so cute.
- Thanks, Gabby.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.684
- Uh, why would you do this?

06:33.768 --> 06:35.394
You already have
two tattoos.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.647
- These I got to rebel
against my mom

06:37.730 --> 06:39.565
and this I got to...

06:39.649 --> 06:41.734
rebel against my mom.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.487
And prove I am not her.
So there.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.322
- Steph, it looks awesome.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.491
Now that makes
me want a tattoo.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.827
- Makes who want
a what now?

06:50.910 --> 06:52.995
- I'm glad we stayed.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.580
- You said you'd
never get one.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.833
- No, I said I'd never get
a stupid zodiac tattoo

06:56.916 --> 06:58.209
like the one Molly has.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.710
But yours is really cute.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.672
I'm gonna go check
out some designs.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.508
- Okay. [sighing]
That was not supposed to happen.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.175
But we are not
gonna freak out.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.095
- What did you just do?

07:09.178 --> 07:11.180
- I said we are not
gonna freak out.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.849
- You can't speak for me.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.517
What did you just do?

07:14.600 --> 07:15.518
- Guys, what's
the big deal?

07:15.601 --> 07:19.355
I've had dozens of tattoos.
They wash off.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.361
- Hi! Hi! Hi!
Where's Gabby?

07:25.444 --> 07:27.363
I heard about
your new tattoo

07:27.446 --> 07:29.699
and I don't want her
makin' the mistake you did.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.533
- Mom, I'm handling it.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.035
You don't need
to give her a talk.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.537
- Oh, it's not a talk.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.039
It's a sermon.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.457
Come on in, Reverend.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.168
- Reverend?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.628
- Strike with confidence and
lock up your graven images

07:42.712 --> 07:47.884
for a minister, ha-ha,
is in the ha-ha house.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.761
- Seriously?
What were you thinking?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.555
Is there a choir
out in the car?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.223
- This man has a lot
to offer a woman.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.351
And I don't just mean
those dimples.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.188
- Mm! Mm! Mm! Maggie Turner,
you are so sweet

08:00.271 --> 08:04.901
I could sell you at
the church bake sale.

08:04.984 --> 08:10.072
- For you, I might be persuaded
to give out a free sample.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.784
- Oh. Mmm!

08:13.868 --> 08:16.287
- Oh, get a pew.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.914
- Bring me this
misguided child!

08:17.997 --> 08:21.209
And a microphone.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.419
- Reverend, I appreciate
you coming,

08:23.502 --> 08:25.213
but I'm already
handling this.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.256
I realize my new
tattoo was a mistake

08:27.340 --> 08:29.592
and I am not going to
let Gabby get one.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.052
- Hm, in that case,
my work here is done.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.929
Oh, what's this?
I mean...

08:34.013 --> 08:38.351
Oh, it's a donation
envelope for the new steeple.

08:38.433 --> 08:42.897
I'll just leave that
here with you. Mm!

08:48.861 --> 08:49.946
- I just talked to Gabby.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.073
She still wants
that tattoo.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.326
So, what's the plan
to handle it?

08:55.409 --> 08:56.619
- Here's the plan.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.454
Tell her no and mean it.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.289
And tell her,
if she gets one,

09:00.373 --> 09:02.541
you'll get a nice
little Gabby rug

09:02.625 --> 09:04.669
for in front of
your fireplace.

09:04.752 --> 09:05.795
- Works for me. Hands in.

09:05.878 --> 09:06.963
- But, guys!

09:07.046 --> 09:08.965
That's not how
we're gonna handle it.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.301
- Five thousand years of
parenting cannot be wrong.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.970
- Well, that's how you
tried to handle me

09:14.053 --> 09:15.846
and I just ran right out
and got one behind your back.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.515
- Well, what do you
think we should do?

09:17.598 --> 09:19.642
- Get Gabby to talk
herself out of it.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.810
It's the only way
we'll know for sure

09:20.893 --> 09:22.812
she won't sneak out
and get one.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.815
- Okay, I'm gonna trust
your judgment on this one.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.483
- I wouldn't.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.819
I dropped her as a baby.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.320
- Oh, shush!

09:31.404 --> 09:32.655
Here's what we'll do.
- Mm-hm.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.115
- Tell Gabby she can have one,

09:34.198 --> 09:36.033
but only if she finds
a design that we agree

09:36.117 --> 09:38.995
is meaningful enough
to have on her body forever.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.162
- No, I'm never gonna
think anything

09:40.246 --> 09:43.207
is meaningful enough
for her to have forever.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.293
Oh!

09:45.376 --> 09:46.877
I'm in.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.838
- What's your back-up plan?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.673
- Charlie knows some
anesthesiologists.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.717
We'll just knock her out
until she's 18.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.012
- Huh, please, if I'm ever
gonna pull that favor,

09:56.095 --> 09:58.180
I'm savin' it for James.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.853
- Hey, buddy, doing
some homework?

10:03.936 --> 10:05.062
- Yeah. No wonder they
call it long division.

10:05.146 --> 10:09.525
It takes forever.

10:09.608 --> 10:12.528
- You know, it might help
if you changed your name.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.572
- Is this because you don't
like me having the same

10:14.655 --> 10:16.115
name as your girlfriend?

10:16.198 --> 10:20.119
- It didn't even
occur to me.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.955
I just wanna see you
thrive academically.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.875
When the grades go out, who
always gets the best one?

10:25.958 --> 10:29.670
- Freddy!

10:29.754 --> 10:32.465
- Freddy? Now that's
a smart kid's name.

10:32.548 --> 10:33.716
You start callin'
yourself "Freddy"

10:33.799 --> 10:36.135
and that long division
will be a breeze.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.055
You'll even move up
to Algebra.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.598
- That's crazy, James.

10:40.681 --> 10:45.436
You just don't want people
thinking you're dating me.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.729
- That is not it.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.939
You just strike me
as more of a "Freddy."

10:49.023 --> 10:50.816
- No, I like being Aaron.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.400
I'm not changing.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.362
- Dude. Freddy. Be cool.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.452
- Okay, guys, I've worked up
some more tattoo designs.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.578
What do you
think of these?

11:02.661 --> 11:04.413
- Let's see what
you've got.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.957
- No. No. No.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.209
Is this one upside down?
- Uh...

11:08.292 --> 11:11.587
- It doesn't matter. No.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.130
A pair of jeans
wearing a monocle?

11:13.214 --> 11:18.386
- He's Fancy Pants.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.470
- No.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.596
- You've rejected
like 40 designs.

11:20.679 --> 11:24.058
Why am I even bothering?
Dad, what do you think?

11:24.141 --> 11:25.643
- I think you should talk
to Stephanie.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.520
I'm deferring to her.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.564
- Why don't you get
a tattoo of a footstool?

11:30.648 --> 11:34.276
'Cause that's what you are.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.612
- Gabby, I told I wouldn't
agree to anything

11:36.695 --> 11:38.322
that wasn't meaningful.

11:38.406 --> 11:42.451
Look, imagine this is your
tattoo now, okay?

11:42.535 --> 11:43.702
It's ironic and fun

11:43.786 --> 11:48.290
and all your friends think
you're the coolest.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.293
This is your tattoo at 80.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.712
It's wrinkled and gross

11:53.796 --> 11:58.759
and your grandkids keep telling
you to pull your shirt down.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.886
A tattoo has to
mean something.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.972
It can't just be
a pretty picture.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.557
- Oh, yeah.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.142
Wow.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.227
Maybe I shouldn't
rush into this.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.522
Thanks, Steph.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.732
- Charlie, it worked!

12:13.816 --> 12:14.608
I never doubted
myself for a second.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.485
- I did. But who cares?
It worked!

12:16.569 --> 12:19.989
- And the best part
is I handled this

12:20.072 --> 12:21.907
without having to be you.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.535
Ah!
- Ah!

12:29.165 --> 12:30.332
- Watch it, you two!

12:30.416 --> 12:32.626
- You just can't admit
that my way works.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.004
- For now. But wait.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.006
You'll end up doing
it like me--

12:37.089 --> 12:42.678
with yelling and just
a dash of physical force!

12:42.761 --> 12:44.638
- Not gonna happen.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.892
- Keep livin' in the land
of wishful thinking.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.935
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:50.019 --> 12:55.191
I must go and make
a preacher beg...

12:55.274 --> 12:59.487
for mercy.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.823
- I'm just glad this whole
tattoo business is over.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.408
- Oh, yeah, me too.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.910
- Hey, when I was
searching online

13:05.993 --> 13:09.371
I saw that my mom's name means
"of the royal forest"

13:09.455 --> 13:13.042
and Stephanie means crown.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.045
So, what if I got a small crown
set against a tree?

13:16.128 --> 13:18.297
It would be a way to always have
my two mothers with me.

13:18.380 --> 13:22.927
- Boy, I...I don't know.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.428
Yeah.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.223
What do you think, honey?

13:27.306 --> 13:30.935
- I think it's beautiful.
- Then I'll get it!

13:31.018 --> 13:32.061
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you!

13:32.144 --> 13:36.023
I'm gonna go tweet some before
pictures of my hip.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.860
- Hip? Hip? Hip? Hip? Hip?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.403
What happened here?

13:41.487 --> 13:44.073
- We've raised an angel.

13:44.156 --> 13:49.453
- Good. Maybe Angel can be her
nickname at the biker bar.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.873
You need to fix this.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.959
- Okay, don't panic.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.585
I had one other idea.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.170
I could take her
to that rat hole

13:58.254 --> 13:59.588
where I got
my first tattoo.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.758
That place is so nasty,
Gabby will run away screaming.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.426
- Really? That's your plan?

14:04.510 --> 14:07.263
- Don't say that like
you never met me.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.807
- This better work.
- It will.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.308
- All right.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.476
'Cause I love you so much,

14:12.560 --> 14:15.104
I'll allow you to
traumatize our daughter.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.856
- Aw, thanks, Charlie.
That means a lot to me.

14:24.863 --> 14:26.115
- What do you think, Erin?

14:26.198 --> 14:28.659
Our sugary Washington Monument's
looking pretty sweet.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.077
You wanna go get a snack?

14:30.160 --> 14:33.747
- Uh, sure, but first, I wanna
show you my new phone.

14:33.831 --> 14:34.832
Okay, check it out.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.625
You can program it to
you by name.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.254
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Hello, Karen.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.381
- Hang on.
My name is Erin.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.759
- You know, Karen is
a pretty good name.

14:45.843 --> 14:49.138
Or Debbie.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.016
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Hello, Karen.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.311
- I'm Erin. Erin. Erin.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.437
Erin!

14:56.520 --> 14:59.106
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Hello, Aaron/Erin.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.317
- Who's calling me?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.569
- Aaron, would you please
get outta here.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.321
- What'd I do?
- I think he means me.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.948
He's freaking out because
my name is Aaron

15:08.032 --> 15:09.366
and your name is Erin.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.784
- I'm not freakin' out!

15:10.868 --> 15:12.286
It's just creepy.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.829
- Oh...
[laughing]

15:13.912 --> 15:16.165
I get it. That is weird.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.333
Look, Erin is my middle name,

15:17.416 --> 15:20.711
and I only go by it because
I hate my first name.

15:20.794 --> 15:24.798
But if it'll make you
feel better,

15:24.882 --> 15:26.091
you can call
me that instead.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.010
- Thank you.
What's your first name?

15:28.093 --> 15:31.013
- Gabrielle. You can
call me "Gabby."

15:31.096 --> 15:33.223
- Okay, we're done here.

15:39.938 --> 15:42.691
- This isn't at all
what I expected.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.026
- Me, neither.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.779
Where's all
the police tape?

15:46.862 --> 15:48.072
- Welcome.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.032
If you brought
your little ones,

15:50.115 --> 15:53.369
they should feel free
to play in our fun zone.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.329
- Uh, what happened
to this place?

15:55.412 --> 15:59.416
The last time I was in here,
I got held for questioning.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.709
- Don't get me
started, man.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.128
We used to be all
about the art,

16:03.212 --> 16:08.384
and then we fell victim
to the almighty franchise.

16:08.467 --> 16:12.763
Have you heard about our
membership rewards program?

16:12.846 --> 16:14.556
- Not interested.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.059
Gabby are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

16:17.142 --> 16:18.560
You haven't changed your mind?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.479
- Oh, no way. I definitely
wanna do this.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.898
And it's all
thanks to you.

16:22.981 --> 16:26.568
This is my design.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.697
- Ah, one crown
and tree right comin' up.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.782
- That's it!
Back away from my baby!

16:31.865 --> 16:33.367
- What are you doing?

16:33.450 --> 16:34.451
- What I should have done
to begin with.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.994
Get out of that chair.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.081
- No way. You said if I had
something meaningful,

16:39.164 --> 16:40.582
then I could get a tattoo.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.875
- I lied.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.544
You should have talked
yourself out of this.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.045
- Talked myself out of this?
That's crazy.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.338
- I don't care.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.925
Now get your sorry 16-year-old
butt in the car!

16:50.008 --> 16:54.179
- We also offer
a counselling service.

16:54.263 --> 16:58.642
- No, I'm here.
I'm getting this.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.602
- Fine!

17:00.686 --> 17:03.272
- Oh! Stop! Stop!

17:03.355 --> 17:06.233
- We got a dragger!

17:06.316 --> 17:09.694
- Leave the chair!
- Let me have it!

17:09.778 --> 17:12.781
- Oh, you're
freakishly strong.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.782
I can't believe
you're this insane.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.369
You're worse than
Grandma Maggie.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.580
- Ain't nobody worse
than Grandma Maggie!

17:20.664 --> 17:23.751
Now get in the car!

17:28.630 --> 17:31.008
- Gabby finally calmed down.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.634
She wishes we'd been
straight with her.

17:32.718 --> 17:37.014
But she understands she can't
get a tattoo right now.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.475
What she is getting
is a new phone.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.435
And a new purse to carry
it around in.

17:41.518 --> 17:45.314
So, we win!

17:45.397 --> 17:47.858
- Charlie, we didn't win.

17:47.941 --> 17:51.361
- Um, do you want
a new phone?

17:51.445 --> 17:54.823
- No. I wanna not
be my mother.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.910
But I am.
[sighing]

17:57.993 --> 17:59.244
And if I'm my mother...

17:59.328 --> 18:00.496
then who's me?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.914
And who was she before
she became her,

18:01.997 --> 18:02.998
and how are you
going to react

18:03.081 --> 18:04.041
now that the me you married

18:04.124 --> 18:05.501
is the her you didn't
sign up for?

18:05.584 --> 18:09.505
- Shh. My turn.

18:09.588 --> 18:13.050
Look, maybe you and your mom
are similar in some ways--

18:13.133 --> 18:16.845
maybe even some
disturbing ways.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.181
But it doesn't make
you the same person.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.893
If it did, do you think
I'd do this?

18:25.354 --> 18:26.939
- I hope not.

18:27.022 --> 18:27.856
- Well, you still
love your mother.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.567
So, just be like
the parts you love

18:30.651 --> 18:33.821
and ignore the parts
you don't.

18:33.904 --> 18:34.863
- Thank you.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.449
- Believe me, there's
plenty of things

18:37.533 --> 18:40.828
about your mother you don't
have and I'm glad.

18:40.911 --> 18:41.870
- Like what?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.831
Give me a couple just
to make me feel better.

18:43.914 --> 18:44.706
- She's loud. She's pushy.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.751
She steals our best wine.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.044
- Thanks, that helps.

18:49.127 --> 18:52.130
- She never knocks. She never
calls before she comes over.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.841
- Okay, Charlie,
I get the point.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.425
- And she's so bossy.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.176
Charlie, get
outta the room.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.889
Charlie, get
outta my face.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.016
- I'm good.
You can stop now.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.560
- And self-centered.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.562
Ha, she is practically
a sociopath.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.189
- You know what?

19:09.273 --> 19:11.233
I am sick of you talking
trash about my mama.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.360
And I will take
that phone!

19:16.154 --> 19:17.614
- Why do I always
go too far?

19:17.698 --> 19:20.242
It's almost like--

19:20.325 --> 19:21.660
I'm my mom.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.204
Unh, I love my mama!

19:28.959 --> 19:31.795
- Oh, good, you're
both here.

19:31.879 --> 19:32.921
If the Reverend asks,

19:33.005 --> 19:37.384
you are troubled youths on
the road to destruction.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.470
- What?
- Where are the boys?

19:40.554 --> 19:45.100
It's not too late to snatch them
from the jaws of evil!

19:45.183 --> 19:47.102
I'm here for you, Maggie--

19:47.185 --> 19:49.021
for as long as it takes.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.773
And a little bit after.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.442
- Amen, Reverend.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.278
And I'm so happy that you were
able to find time

19:56.361 --> 20:01.116
to fix a crisis in
the church family.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.451
- Mm! Open up, young fellas!

20:02.534 --> 20:04.369
When you tell me
your sins,

20:04.453 --> 20:08.248
that's when
the healin' begins!

20:08.332 --> 20:11.710
- I'm wanted in West Virginia.

20:11.793 --> 20:15.380
