WEBVTT

00:10.358 --> 00:11.272
Leo, I need your help.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.795
Why, what's the matter?

00:12.969 --> 00:14.623
The Elders have assigned
me a charge.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.016
Paige, that's great.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.321
No, actually,
it's not great.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.019
You have to help me
get out of this.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.803
You can't get out of it;
you're a whitelighter.

00:20.977 --> 00:24.676
I'm also like a chick in her 20s
who'd like to have a life.

00:24.850 --> 00:25.895
I don't have time for this.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.549
You're nervous.

00:27.723 --> 00:28.724
[sighs]

00:28.898 --> 00:31.161
No, I'm just busy.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.424
All right, fine,
maybe I'm a little nervous.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.078
You know what?
Used to happen to me

00:35.252 --> 00:37.907
all the time
before I met my first charge.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.604
It's a good thing.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.258
It means you don't want
to let them down.Or...

00:41.432 --> 00:42.520
maybe I'm just not ready.

00:42.694 --> 00:43.695
Trust me, you're ready.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.132
Yeah? Then...

00:45.306 --> 00:46.785
why don't you tell that
to my stomach,

00:46.959 --> 00:48.396
'cause it really hurts
right now.

00:48.570 --> 00:51.268
Look, here, try this.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.401
Toast?

00:53.575 --> 00:55.446
Yeah, it helps calm
the butterflies.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.449
You've been a
whitelighter
for 60 years,

00:58.623 --> 01:00.190
and toast is what
you got for me?

01:00.364 --> 01:03.063
Well, it's not like you haven't
had charges before, Paige.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.412
Okay?

01:04.586 --> 01:06.240
Right, okay, fine,

01:06.414 --> 01:08.416
but I always had Piper

01:08.590 --> 01:10.592
and Phoebe to back me up.

01:10.766 --> 01:11.810
All right? Now I'll be solo.

01:11.984 --> 01:12.942
[takes deep breath]

01:13.116 --> 01:13.943
What if I fail?

01:14.117 --> 01:15.553
You won't fail.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.120
[talking with mouth full]:
That's easy for you to say

01:17.294 --> 01:18.730
'cause you have a job,
you got your wife,

01:18.904 --> 01:21.907
you got your kids,
you got... breakfast.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.432
If I make a mistake,
someone dies.

01:24.606 --> 01:25.650
You're done?

01:26.738 --> 01:28.218
Yeah. How did you know?

01:28.392 --> 01:29.828
Toast and venting.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.743
Works every time.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.659
Huh.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.313
Guess I could try.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.489
I know you can do it.

01:38.663 --> 01:39.664
Good luck.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.276
Thank you.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.286
Hey, man, thanks a lot.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.288
I appreciate it.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.422
[sighs]

01:58.596 --> 02:00.120
Mitchell Hanes?

02:00.294 --> 02:01.730
Yeah.

02:01.904 --> 02:06.126
Hi. I'm, uh, your new
whitelighter, Paige Matthews.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.736
Nice to meet you...

02:07.910 --> 02:10.956
Not interested.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.567
Well, you can't just
walk away from me.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.438
No? Watch me.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.962
Aren't you at least
gonna hear me out?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.790
Let me guess.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.879
That I'm a witch
with great powers.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.838
You can help bring
them out for me,

02:23.012 --> 02:24.187
master them.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.884
Well, yeah.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.625
I don't want your help.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.236
Wait, wait.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.368
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.717
Look, I know, you've had
some problems in the past,

02:32.891 --> 02:34.284
but maybe you just

02:34.458 --> 02:37.418
haven't had the right person
help you, namely me.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.724
My last whitelighter
said the same thing.

02:39.898 --> 02:42.510
They ever send anybody who
hasn't read the Elder playbook?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.773
I'm not just anybody, okay.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.514
I am a Charmed One,

02:46.688 --> 02:49.169
I ran Magic School for a year,
andI'm a whitelighter.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.431
Hello? Triple threat.

02:50.605 --> 02:51.780
Where are you going
to find somebody

02:51.954 --> 02:53.434
with that kind
of experience?

02:53.608 --> 02:54.957
Good, you can use it to
help your next charge.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.007
[yells]

03:03.095 --> 03:04.706
Okay, wait, listen.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.403
New rule.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.057
I will not tolerate demon
activity in my house

03:08.231 --> 03:09.058
or in my club.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.320
Got it?

03:11.016 --> 03:13.236
[yells]

03:14.759 --> 03:16.108
Bar stool!

03:22.376 --> 03:23.203
You okay?

03:23.377 --> 03:25.117
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.728
What the hell do you
think they wanted?

03:26.902 --> 03:28.208
I have no clue.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.340
At least you're okay.

He has a concussion,
needs a few stitches,

05:29.416 --> 05:30.547
but otherwise he's fine.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.332
Oh, thank God.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.160
Did he, uh, say whether, you
know, he had seen anything?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.727
He was hit from behind.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.425
Last thing he remembers
was loading a case of beer

05:38.599 --> 05:39.600
from his hand truck.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.253
Oh, that was good...

05:41.428 --> 05:43.604
I mean, you know,
that he remembers something

05:43.778 --> 05:46.258
because that probably means he
doesn't have any brain damage.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.738
Well, stick around.

05:47.912 --> 05:51.655
The detective's gonna need
to take a statement.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.831
Probably doesn't have
any brain damage?

05:54.005 --> 05:55.442
Smooth, Piper,
real smooth.

05:55.616 --> 05:58.096
Well, that's the last time
I call 911.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.098
Well sadly, now that
Leo can't heal us,

06:00.272 --> 06:03.580
I think we're going to be
calling that number a lot more.

06:03.754 --> 06:04.712
I can't believe this.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.104
They attack me at work now?

06:06.278 --> 06:07.802
What, is no place sacred?

06:07.976 --> 06:09.412
Well, I thought we
covered pretty well.

06:09.586 --> 06:10.848
Yeah, this time.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.633
What about next time
and the time after that?

06:12.807 --> 06:14.852
Well, we'll just deal
with it when it happens.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.854
No, I'm gonna deal
with them now.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.465
Well, before you do that,
can you help me out?

06:18.639 --> 06:19.640
The reason why I came here:

06:19.814 --> 06:21.337
That guy Mitchell...
blew me off.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.384
My charge.
Oh.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.646
Oh?

06:25.820 --> 06:27.865
That's all you have
for me is "oh"?

06:28.039 --> 06:29.214
Well, I can't really
help you out

06:29.389 --> 06:30.520
with that whole
whitelighter thing.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.304
You should probably
talk to Leo.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.482
Excuse me.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.266
You're Phoebe Halliwell's
sisters, right?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.703
Right.
Yeah.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.444
I'm Inspector Sheridan.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.403
I met Phoebe a couple of
weeks ago on a different case.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.666
Oh, well, it's
nice to meet you.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.232
Uh... where is
Lieutenant...

06:47.407 --> 06:48.320
Lieutenant Morris?

06:48.495 --> 06:49.539
He's out of town.

06:49.713 --> 06:50.888
Just taking some
personal time.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.499
I'll be covering for him
while he's gone.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.327
So, uh, could you
describe the suspects?

06:55.502 --> 06:56.894
Tall, short,

06:57.068 --> 06:58.505
white, black?

06:58.679 --> 07:00.202
Didn't really get
a good look at them.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.422
PIPER:
Yeah, we were
in the back

07:02.596 --> 07:04.249
and by the time we
came out, they were...

07:04.424 --> 07:05.599
Gone... yeah,

07:05.773 --> 07:07.339
gone.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.298
What I don't understand is
why would they rob the place

07:09.472 --> 07:11.779
in the middle of the day
before you even opened?

07:11.953 --> 07:16.479
We have been asking ourselves
the same question.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.263
Hmm.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.743
Well,

07:19.917 --> 07:20.962
we'll stay in touch.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.141
Well,

07:26.315 --> 07:28.970
the good news is, I don't think
she remembers meeting us.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.754
Thank God for memory dust.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.887
Yeah, but it's not
100% guaranteed.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.497
If we give her the
slightest cause,

07:34.671 --> 07:36.325
her memory could
come flying back,

07:36.499 --> 07:39.981
which is another reason we need
to find the demon who did this.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.117
Come closer, Lantos.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.163
You can tell me why
you failed from here

07:48.337 --> 07:50.382
just as easily as
from over there.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.429
I'm confident the witch
will be alone again soon.

07:53.603 --> 07:57.172
I don't have time for soon.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.956
I need a lock of hair now.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.872
The only way to
weaken Zankou

08:02.046 --> 08:04.919
is to take out his most
trusted lieutenants:

08:05.093 --> 08:09.619
Daleek, Benzor, Linson
all above ground.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.752
All of whom I
can only get to

08:11.926 --> 08:14.581
with the help of the
beautiful Charmed Ones.

08:15.973 --> 08:19.977
Tell me, Lantos,

08:20.151 --> 08:21.457
do you think I'm
beautiful, too?

08:21.631 --> 08:23.067
Of course.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.852
[giggling]

08:25.853 --> 08:26.941
Do you want
another scar?

08:27.115 --> 08:28.682
I can make you
look like me

08:28.856 --> 08:32.076
in no time, you know.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.861
To your chambers.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.039
We can't wait
any longer.

08:38.213 --> 08:39.562
I reported to the Source.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.651
I won't do the same
with his successor.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.871
Then I'll need at least
a half a dozen more demons.

08:44.045 --> 08:47.004
You can't overcome the
sisters with force,

08:47.178 --> 08:48.658
especially not Piper,

08:48.832 --> 08:51.095
and since she'll be
expecting another attack,

08:51.269 --> 08:54.446
I need you to go after a
different sister instead now.

08:54.621 --> 08:55.491
Phoebe.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.275
Why not Paige?

08:57.449 --> 08:59.190
She's less intuitive,
more predictable.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.366
But she's also a
whitelighter now,

09:01.541 --> 09:03.455
which puts her in constant
contact with the Elders.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.022
Besides,

09:05.196 --> 09:09.636
Phoebe's a celebrity...
idolized, envied.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.377
The way I deserve to be...

09:12.552 --> 09:14.292
and someday will be.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.040
PHOEBE:
Lawyers!

09:23.214 --> 09:24.912
There should be
a special place in Hell

09:25.086 --> 09:26.740
for each and every one
of them.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.219
Okay, before
you freak out,

09:28.393 --> 09:29.351
let me tell you about...

09:29.525 --> 09:30.874
I mean,
talk about an attack.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.310
Exactly.

09:32.484 --> 09:33.921
The paper's been sued
by just a few people,

09:34.095 --> 09:35.662
and now the whole legal
department is clamping down

09:35.836 --> 09:36.706
on the reporters.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.273
So? You're not a reporter.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.753
Anyway, as I was...
No,

09:39.927 --> 09:41.493
but I'm a columnist,
and they're saying

09:41.668 --> 09:43.583
that I could actually be sued
if I gave bad advice.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.280
So they want every one
of my columns

09:45.454 --> 09:47.935
to be reviewed
by a professional shrink.

09:48.109 --> 09:51.503
Okay, well, technically, you're
not a real shrink, so as I...

09:51.678 --> 09:52.635
Excuse me.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.289
Bachelor's degree,
four years.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.899
I mean, besides,
my readers don't care

09:56.073 --> 09:57.118
about my credentials.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.119
All they care about
is my insight.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.773
Yes, that is true.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.297
Now, why don't you direct
that famous insight

10:02.471 --> 10:04.734
towards the fact that I
was attacked at P3 today.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.693
Oh, my God.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.433
Are you okay?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.697
Well, I'm alive,
which the demons won't be

10:10.871 --> 10:12.742
when I'm done with them,
providing I can find them.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.265
Wait, they're not in The Book?

10:14.439 --> 10:15.963
Well, too many
fit the description.

10:16.137 --> 10:19.444
God, that is so weird.
Demons never attack at P3.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.837
Even weirder,

10:21.011 --> 10:22.143
I don't think
they wanted to kill me.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.710
One of them could
have easily

10:23.884 --> 10:25.537
nailed me with a fireball
but then didn't.

10:25.712 --> 10:26.887
Huh.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.410
Here.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.543
What's this?

10:31.718 --> 10:33.807
New policy, we carry them
for protection at all times.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.460
Yeah, but if we don't know
what kind of demon it is.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.418
Well, it
doesn't matter.

10:36.592 --> 10:37.506
If it doesn't kill them,

10:37.680 --> 10:38.986
it will at least stun them.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.902
Wow, and I thought
I was on a rampage.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.425
Well, I'm sending
the Underworld a message:

10:43.599 --> 10:45.819
Basically, back off
and let me live my life.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.821
And I'm going
to help you with that.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.823
But first, I have to deal
with my column.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.173
You want me to have a life, too,
don't you?

10:52.347 --> 10:53.914
If you must.

10:56.699 --> 10:57.787
TEACHER:
Is there anything else, sir?

10:57.961 --> 10:59.789
So I need a copy to go
to every teacher

10:59.963 --> 11:02.052
and tell Mr. Feeney
a definite yes

11:02.226 --> 11:03.837
on the after-school
TK classes.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.447
I'll take care of
it right away.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.406
So you're bummed
with your charge, huh?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.452
Yeah, I'd say majorly.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.454
Well, don't let it
get you down.

11:12.628 --> 11:13.977
Reluctant charges
come with the territory.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.326
Well, I'm kind
of wishing

11:15.500 --> 11:16.545
the Elders could
have maybe given me

11:16.719 --> 11:17.459
a little bit
more to go on.

11:17.633 --> 11:18.286
Let's see, I know that

11:18.460 --> 11:19.635
he told he, uh,

11:19.809 --> 11:21.028
has had several
whitelighters,

11:21.202 --> 11:22.682
and he has
the power of hyper speed,

11:22.856 --> 11:23.900
I pretty much could have
found that out on Google.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.685
[bell rings]Hold that thought. Yes?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.817
I'm not feeling very well.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.906
Could you fill in for me
in corporealizing class?

11:30.080 --> 11:31.995
No problem.
Go home, get some rest.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.388
Thanks.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.914
What?Nothing.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.481
You're just impressive,
that's all.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.657
What do you mean?Well, as the

11:41.831 --> 11:43.354
headmistress of this school
for a year,

11:43.528 --> 11:45.269
and, uh, you make it look easy

11:45.443 --> 11:46.444
and I know it's
anything but.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.924
Thanks.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.970
So you need an assistant?

11:50.144 --> 11:52.276
Paige.What? I don't
think I'm

11:52.450 --> 11:53.713
cut out
for this whitelighter stuff.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.584
And I still
don't trust the Elders.

11:55.758 --> 11:56.803
Because they didn't tell you
everything you needed to know

11:56.977 --> 11:57.891
about Mitchell?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.631
They don't
tell you anything.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.285
They want you to get to know
your charges yourself.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.505
Okay, then why do they
send me out to some guy

12:03.679 --> 12:05.812
who hates whitelighters and
doesn't even want to talk to me?

12:05.986 --> 12:07.204
Well, you got to find a way
to make him talk.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.250
It's your job;
you're his guide.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.339
Look, Paige, if you don't get
him to use his powers,

12:11.513 --> 12:12.383
there's a lot
of future innocents

12:12.557 --> 12:13.776
that are going to be lost.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.039
Gee, thanks, no pressure there.The Elders

12:16.213 --> 12:17.519
wouldn't give you
this assignment

12:17.693 --> 12:18.781
if they didn't think
you can handle it.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.478
Use your instincts.

12:20.652 --> 12:21.610
Be creative.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.309
Look, once I had these charges

12:25.483 --> 12:28.617
who were a little less than
willing to use their powers.

12:28.791 --> 12:31.141
So, I had to assimilate myself
into their lives,

12:31.315 --> 12:32.186
get them to trust me

12:32.360 --> 12:34.754
before I could help them.

12:34.928 --> 12:38.279
Pretended to be a handyman,
worked like a charm.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.454
Let me guess...

12:39.628 --> 12:41.412
you married one of them?Yeah.

12:41.586 --> 12:42.979
Well, let's just say
that the Charmed Ones

12:43.153 --> 12:44.720
make Mitchell
look like a piece of cake.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.076
I don't care what they say
in the legal department,

12:53.250 --> 12:55.644
that guy is not touching one
word of what I've written.

12:55.818 --> 12:58.255
All right, you know what,
I'll be up there in a second.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.131
[sighs]

13:09.919 --> 13:10.572
Oh!

13:16.534 --> 13:17.753
[screams]

13:30.635 --> 13:32.115
It's my favorite scissors.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.900
I knew I left them somewhere.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.075
[coughs]

13:40.907 --> 13:43.910
What pretty hair she has.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.044
This is going to be fun.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.872
I was lucky
to get out of there alive.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.569
Her powers
of intuition are...

13:51.743 --> 13:55.617
Won't do any good once she's
trapped inside my cage.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.619
Still, if her sisters can
anticipate like she...

13:57.793 --> 13:58.794
They can't.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.753
Phoebe's power
is unique.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.930
I wonder how men
look at her

14:04.104 --> 14:06.454
with lustful
hearts no doubt.

14:06.628 --> 14:07.716
Maybe we should hold off

14:07.890 --> 14:09.022
on the transfer
until we're sure...

14:09.196 --> 14:10.762
How long have we
been watching them?

14:10.937 --> 14:12.721
By now we know the Charmed
Ones better than anyone,

14:12.895 --> 14:14.592
including Zankou.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.072
But their bond is strong.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.683
To fool them even
for a day, we...

14:20.468 --> 14:22.426
Like I said,
we've learned enough.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.432
I cannot believe
they cut a piece from my hair,

14:28.606 --> 14:30.695
and I just spent $250
on a cut and color.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.783
PIPER:
What?

14:31.958 --> 14:35.048
You spent $250 on a haircut?

14:35.222 --> 14:37.267
You could have bought a week's
worth of groceries with that.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.791
Okay, I don't think
the price of my haircut

14:39.966 --> 14:41.228
should be
your main concern right now.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.751
[sighs]
Okay, you're right.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.448
Actually, this is good news.

14:44.622 --> 14:45.885
For whom exactly?

14:46.059 --> 14:47.190
All of us.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.235
I mean, how many
demons specialize

14:48.409 --> 14:49.584
in cutting someone's hair?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.238
It should make them
easier to find.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.369
What did they look like,
long coat and greasy hair?

14:52.543 --> 14:53.501
Yeah,

14:53.675 --> 14:54.806
and wielding some mean scissors,

14:54.981 --> 14:56.330
which by the way I have.

14:56.504 --> 14:57.940
Oh, good. We can use them
to scry with.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.464
PHOEBE:
Okay, I'll drop them off at home

15:00.638 --> 15:02.423
as soon as I deal with someone
else who wants a piece of me.

15:02.597 --> 15:03.598
I got to go.

15:03.772 --> 15:04.729
Wait... Phoebe, wait.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.296
[phone clicks off]

15:07.341 --> 15:08.342
Miss Halliwell, hello.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.473
I'm Dr. Randall.

15:09.647 --> 15:10.866
Yes,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.694
I know exactly who you are.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.565
You're the guy here
to ruin my column.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.655
Hmm, I sense
some displaced anger.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.483
Oh, no, it's very well placed.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.311
And you could
put your red pencil away,

15:21.485 --> 15:23.400
because you're not touching
a thing that I've written.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.576
Well, I'm afraid you don't have
a say in the matter.Oh, really?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.362
Because the column is called
"Ask Phoebe,"

15:28.536 --> 15:30.146
so I'm pretty sure I do.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.760
'Ekat ym lous.

15:35.935 --> 15:40.330
Ekat e demratc eno.

15:40.504 --> 15:43.464
Edart met one.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.555
Ahh!

15:52.952 --> 15:55.432
Let me remind you,
you're not the doctor.

15:55.606 --> 15:56.738
I am.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.435
After all, I don't see

15:58.609 --> 16:01.090
any diplomas
on your walls.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.796
IMARA'S VOICE:
Nice.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.016
PHOEBE'S VOICE:
What's going on?
Where am I?

16:14.190 --> 16:15.409
You're with us
now, Phoebe.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.585
Get in the cage.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.282
Hello, witch.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.067
I hope you
enjoy the view.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.547
It will be the last one
you ever have.

16:26.724 --> 16:27.638
RANDALL:
So,

16:27.812 --> 16:29.205
whether you like it or not,

16:29.379 --> 16:30.685
you and I are going to
be working together

16:30.859 --> 16:31.816
for a long time.

16:31.991 --> 16:32.992
Do we understand each other?

16:34.036 --> 16:35.907
Do you think I'm hot?

16:36.082 --> 16:37.909
Uh... excuse me?

16:41.217 --> 16:44.133
This is going to be fun.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.055
PIPER:
Any luck finding our demons?

16:53.229 --> 16:54.448
Nope.

16:54.622 --> 16:57.103
Well, good. I'm glad
it just wasn't me.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.974
By the way,
thanks.
For what?

16:59.148 --> 17:00.932
For coming home to help me
in the middle of the day.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.022
You were attacked.Yeah.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.415
I'm working on that not
happening so much anymore.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.113
Well, you know, Piper,

17:07.287 --> 17:08.679
you can't scare away
all the demons all the time,

17:08.853 --> 17:10.420
you know that.No, but I can

17:10.594 --> 17:12.770
make some think twice
about attacking again, can't I?

17:12.944 --> 17:14.250
Besides, I'd like
to think

17:14.424 --> 17:15.904
that one day you could come home

17:16.078 --> 17:17.732
in the middle of the day
for, I don't know, lunch?

17:17.906 --> 17:21.649
Hmm, well, you know, we could
find something else to do

17:21.823 --> 17:23.694
for, like, an hour or so.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.262
Take it easy. Keep checking.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.440
Hmm, you know,
I'm thinking

17:30.614 --> 17:32.268
whoever wanted the hair
was probably working

17:32.442 --> 17:33.487
for an upper level demon.

17:33.661 --> 17:36.142
Question is, who?

17:36.316 --> 17:39.449
Mm... soul swapper?

17:39.623 --> 17:40.450
Could be.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.017
Or voodoo priestess

17:42.191 --> 17:43.366
or witch doctor

17:43.540 --> 17:45.368
or demonic cloner.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.849
A cloner, that wouldn't
be such a bad thing.

17:48.023 --> 17:50.634
At least then, I'd have another
sister to fight demons with.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.506
Did someone say fight demons?

17:53.594 --> 17:56.249
'Cause I am so there.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.424
What are you doing back so soon?

17:57.598 --> 17:59.600
Uh... what do you mean?

17:59.774 --> 18:00.905
Well, what happened
with the shrink?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.299
Oh, I took care of him.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.387
[gasps]

18:04.561 --> 18:06.911
Oh, my God.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.565
Oh, for God's sakes,

18:08.739 --> 18:10.132
your hair looks fine.

18:10.306 --> 18:11.742
LEO:
You know,
maybe we should

18:11.916 --> 18:13.396
go up and check
The Book of Shadows again.

18:13.570 --> 18:14.484
I already checked it.

18:14.658 --> 18:15.790
Maybe we should check again.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.795
I mean, I'm just saying that
we have to fight demons, right?

18:36.985 --> 18:40.249
Any idea what these
demon creeps are looking for?

18:40.423 --> 18:41.555
Not yet.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.122
But the more I
think about it,

18:43.296 --> 18:44.471
the more I'm leaning
towards soul-swapping.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.255
Soul-swapping?

18:46.429 --> 18:48.823
No... I don't buy it.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.781
Well, if it was voodoo,

18:50.955 --> 18:52.087
they could have just stolen a
comb or a brush to get the hair.

18:52.261 --> 18:53.828
See, soul-swappingis more

18:54.002 --> 18:56.178
powerful, it requires
fresh ingredients,

18:56.352 --> 18:58.746
which explains why they needed
the freshly cut hair.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.617
Yeah, but demons have tried
to impersonate us before,

19:00.791 --> 19:01.749
and it's never worked.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.098
I mean, we just

19:03.272 --> 19:04.447
know each other too well.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.188
She's got a point.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.582
Besides, at least
we still have the scissors

19:08.756 --> 19:09.626
to scry for them with.

19:09.800 --> 19:10.888
Scissors?

19:11.062 --> 19:12.803
Aren't they in
your purse?

19:12.977 --> 19:13.891
I'll go get them.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.066
[gasps]

19:15.241 --> 19:16.590
Phoebe?

19:16.764 --> 19:18.244
PIPER:What?

19:18.418 --> 19:19.593
Did you have a premonition?

19:19.767 --> 19:21.769
Yes, I did.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.074
A very

19:23.249 --> 19:24.859
big one.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.382
This is the guy.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.385
This is the guy
we're looking for right here.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.605
Daleek?

19:31.779 --> 19:33.259
Well, he
doesn't look like

19:33.433 --> 19:34.608
any of the demons
that attacked us.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.000
Are you sure?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.785
You know, maybe he's
working with them.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.266
Yeah, that's probably it.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.268
"Upper level demon,
works above ground"

19:42.442 --> 19:43.834
You know, it could
be a Zankou plan.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.619
Wouldn't be
the first time.

19:45.793 --> 19:46.968
But it doesn't say

19:47.142 --> 19:48.317
anything about
him cutting hair.

19:48.491 --> 19:49.710
But I saw

19:49.884 --> 19:52.408
him posing as a civilian
in my premonition.

19:52.582 --> 19:53.888
What more proof do we need?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.064
Okay, but...
Great.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.500
I'll meet you downstairs,

19:57.674 --> 19:58.893
I'm going to go
slip into something

19:59.067 --> 20:00.373
a little bit more sexy.

20:00.547 --> 20:01.504
Sexy?

20:01.678 --> 20:02.549
Phoebe, we're
killing a demon,

20:02.723 --> 20:03.941
not going to the club.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.769
Did I say sexy?

20:05.943 --> 20:07.728
I meant comfortable.

20:07.902 --> 20:08.903
Wait.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.298
God, now what?

20:12.472 --> 20:15.126
Maybe we shouldn't go
after this guy until we have

20:15.301 --> 20:16.302
the power of Three.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.912
LEO:
Well, you can
call Paige

20:18.086 --> 20:19.348
if you need her, but now that
she's a whitelighter,

20:19.522 --> 20:20.610
you got to get used
to working without her;

20:20.784 --> 20:21.872
she's not going to be
around as much.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.613
What he said.Yeah, and besides,

20:23.787 --> 20:25.267
you have potions;
if it does turn out

20:25.441 --> 20:26.747
to be an upper level demon,
it's nothing you haven't

20:26.921 --> 20:28.314
handled before.

20:28.488 --> 20:29.358
Couldn't have said it
any better myself.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.969
I'm going to go change.

20:38.585 --> 20:39.977
Ow!

20:40.151 --> 20:41.240
[chuckling]

20:41.414 --> 20:42.632
You have
somewhere to go?

20:42.806 --> 20:44.547
[laughing]

20:44.721 --> 20:46.201
I can't believe
I was worried

20:46.375 --> 20:47.855
we wouldn't
pull this off.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.770
I'll get out
of here eventually.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.554
Ooh! With a
face like that,

20:51.728 --> 20:53.121
you're better
off in the cage.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.688
[gasps]

20:54.862 --> 20:56.646
Aw, don't feel
all that charmed

20:56.820 --> 20:58.300
now, do you?
My sisters

20:58.474 --> 21:00.520
will get me out of this cage
and this body.

21:00.694 --> 21:01.695
You're forgetting,

21:01.869 --> 21:03.653
for them to come to your rescue,

21:03.827 --> 21:05.481
they first have to realize
that Imara's in yourbody.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.874
You don't think they can tell

21:07.048 --> 21:08.267
when there's a demon
in the house?

21:08.441 --> 21:09.746
There was a demon
in your house,

21:09.920 --> 21:11.531
not long ago-- Zankou.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.750
And everything he
learned, we learned.

21:13.924 --> 21:16.013
Imara broke into
his lair, stole all
his information.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.841
Now she knows everything
about you.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.103
I don't care.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.714
My sisters will figure it out.

21:20.888 --> 21:23.151
By then it'll be too late
for both you and Zankou.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.109
We'll have killed
all his allies,

21:25.284 --> 21:26.328
weakened him to the
point where he can
no longer rule.

21:26.502 --> 21:27.808
And as for you,

21:27.982 --> 21:28.939
you're only keeping
Imara's body alive

21:29.113 --> 21:30.593
so her soul can return to it.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.334
Too bad

21:32.508 --> 21:34.118
there won't be a body
for your soul to return to.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.129
[tires squealing,
loud crash]

21:45.304 --> 21:46.305
Oh, no.

21:47.958 --> 21:50.047
[steam hissing]

21:50.221 --> 21:51.832
[explosive popping]WOMAN:
Help me!

21:52.006 --> 21:53.877
Please!

21:54.051 --> 21:55.139
Someone!

21:55.314 --> 21:56.532
Help!

22:00.623 --> 22:01.929
[crackling]

22:04.148 --> 22:05.585
[crackling]

22:06.934 --> 22:08.544
[explosive popping]

22:14.420 --> 22:15.812
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

22:19.250 --> 22:20.164
Surprise.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.252
What the hell?

22:21.427 --> 22:22.297
What are you doing?

22:22.471 --> 22:24.125
Are you out of your mind?

22:24.299 --> 22:25.953
Look, I'm just trying
to show you

22:26.127 --> 22:27.433
that your powers can save lives.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.869
You didn't have
to save mine,

22:29.043 --> 22:30.261
but you could have
if you had to.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.219
So you tricked me?

22:31.393 --> 22:32.612
Technically.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.396
Here's the thing.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.616
I'm trying to remind you
of what your powers can do,

22:36.790 --> 22:39.358
and why you can't just walk away
from a gift like that.

22:39.532 --> 22:40.707
The hell I can't.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.578
Mitchell, please!You don't know me.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.754
You don't know
me at all.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.412
Can someone tell me why
I'm trying to help this person?

22:50.586 --> 22:52.414
You crashed your car?

22:52.588 --> 22:53.937
It was a rental.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.417
What? I got
the insurance.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.245
That's not
the point, Paige.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.160
Look, you told
me to trust my
instincts, right?

22:59.334 --> 23:00.509
I did.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.598
Yeah, to earn his trust,
not destroy it.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.078
Maybe there'sa reason

23:04.252 --> 23:05.775
nobody's been able to
get through to him.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.429
Maybe he just
can't be gotten to.

23:07.603 --> 23:08.909
Look, I don't think

23:09.083 --> 23:10.998
there's any such thing
as a lost cause, Paige.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.130
All right, maybe it's just time
to get somebody else.

23:13.304 --> 23:15.002
Paige.What? I mean it.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.483
Call the Elders and have them
get another whitelighter,

23:17.657 --> 23:19.136
'cause I'm done.
I can't do it.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.269
So, you're just
gonna give up?

23:23.271 --> 23:24.968
I cannot
force Mitchell

23:25.142 --> 23:27.275
to be a witch. I can't.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.450
Yeah, maybe that's your problem.

23:28.624 --> 23:29.669
What?

23:29.843 --> 23:31.366
He's not just a witch, Paige.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.369
He's a person, too, and
actually, he was a person first.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.110
You know, your powers
are tied to your emotions,

23:36.284 --> 23:37.851
so stop concentrating on him
as a witch

23:38.025 --> 23:39.766
and start focusing
on him as a man.

23:48.557 --> 23:49.776
We're vanquishing
a city councilman?

23:49.950 --> 23:51.125
Are you crazy?

23:51.299 --> 23:52.866
I saw him posing
as a civilian.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.737
You were fine
with it before.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.652
Yeah, that's because
I thought we were
gonna find him

23:56.826 --> 23:58.828
in an alley or a
warehouse somewhere,
not downtown.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.700
You insisted
that I come home from work

24:00.874 --> 24:02.223
so we could deal with it.

24:02.397 --> 24:03.616
Okay, would you stop
clickety-clacking

24:03.790 --> 24:05.400
in those things
for one second?

24:05.574 --> 24:08.142
Look, I want to kill demons
just as much as you do,

24:08.316 --> 24:10.405
probably even more,
but we can't afford
to be reckless,

24:10.579 --> 24:12.102
especially with Sheridan
lurking around.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.887
Sheridan?Yeah, this morning
at the bar?

24:14.061 --> 24:15.541
Oh, right. Sorry.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.456
I got demon councilman
on the brain.

24:17.630 --> 24:20.067
I really don't want her on our
case again.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.372
What are you doing?

24:21.547 --> 24:23.113
Are you checking
yourself out?

24:23.287 --> 24:24.419
Yeah. It's not a crime.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.334
No, but now
is not the time.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.640
Don't be so vain.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.946
I just want to look
presentable, okay?

24:30.120 --> 24:32.819
'Cause we are meeting
a councilman, for God's sakes.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.125
Well, then maybe
you should put on a jacket.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.476
A councilman you
thinkmight be evil.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.869
I know he's evil,
and you will, too,

24:40.043 --> 24:41.480
once you freeze the scene.

24:41.654 --> 24:43.743
Yeah, if he's upper level,
he's not freezing.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.354
Can I help you?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.704
No.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.883
[door opening]

24:54.057 --> 24:56.886
Excuse me,
Councilman Wexler?

24:57.060 --> 24:58.322
I'm sorry.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.063
Do we have an appointment?

25:00.237 --> 25:02.544
No, Daleek,
actually, we don't.

25:04.415 --> 25:05.547
[groans]

25:05.721 --> 25:08.550
[grunts]

25:08.724 --> 25:10.596
Wow! That was awesome!

25:10.770 --> 25:11.945
What was in there?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.816
Who cares? Let's go.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.818
Hey, what's the rush?

25:15.992 --> 25:17.646
Everyone's frozen anyway.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.648
Yeah, well, I don't want to
be here when they unfreeze

25:19.822 --> 25:21.650
and figure out that
their boss is missing.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.261
PHOEBE:No one will ever
know we were here.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.833
I think we should just
concentrate on the demon

25:31.007 --> 25:32.400
who actuallyattacked us.

25:32.574 --> 25:33.749
We'll get him.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.534
When?

25:35.708 --> 25:37.623
Well, when I try
and get a few more
premonitions.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.015
I mean, who knows

25:39.189 --> 25:40.451
how many demons
Zankou has out there?

25:40.626 --> 25:42.279
But our first demon
still has a piece

25:42.453 --> 25:43.716
of your hair, and who knows

25:43.890 --> 25:45.718
when he's gonna use it
or come back for more?

25:45.892 --> 25:47.415
[scoffs]:
Who cares?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.417
With a face like this, I
can be bald and look great.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.766
What the hell's gotten into you?

25:50.940 --> 25:53.421
What do you mean?What do I mean?

25:53.595 --> 25:55.249
You're walking around
like a crazy person,

25:55.423 --> 25:57.120
that is when you're not stopping
to check yourself out

25:57.294 --> 25:59.688
in every shiny surface
you walk past!

25:59.862 --> 26:02.517
Well, I think I'm just a little
scattered and overwhelmed,

26:02.691 --> 26:04.388
you know, with
the column

26:04.563 --> 26:07.957
and all these demons, and trying
to help you find a normal life.

26:08.131 --> 26:09.568
And I appreciate that,

26:09.742 --> 26:12.092
but it doesn't require us
going a mile a minute.

26:12.266 --> 26:13.615
Well, you said you wanted

26:13.789 --> 26:14.703
to make a statement
to the demon world.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.139
Then what better
statement

26:16.313 --> 26:17.750
than to kill a lot
of demons, right?

26:17.924 --> 26:19.316
Right.

26:19.490 --> 26:20.840
Where are you going?

26:21.014 --> 26:22.319
I'm going upstairs
to change my outfit.

26:22.493 --> 26:23.494
I've beenin this

26:23.669 --> 26:25.627
for, like, the last hour.

26:25.801 --> 26:29.457
[doorbell rings]

26:31.502 --> 26:32.852
Inspector, hello.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.375
Piper.

26:34.549 --> 26:36.899
What, uh, brings you
all the way out here?

26:37.073 --> 26:39.032
Well, actually, this does.

26:39.206 --> 26:42.601
The city councilman's
gone missing, and according

26:42.775 --> 26:43.950
to that photograph,

26:44.124 --> 26:45.342
the two of you were
the last people

26:45.516 --> 26:46.909
to see him
before he disappeared.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.650
And you think we had something
to do with that?

26:48.824 --> 26:49.782
I don't know.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.480
Did you?
No!

26:52.654 --> 26:54.961
I mean, we went to talk to him
about some branches

26:55.135 --> 26:56.440
that were hanging
over our backyard.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.051
That's interesting, considering

26:58.225 --> 26:59.922
that he's not really
yourcouncilman.

27:00.096 --> 27:04.013
Right, which we, uh, figured out
when we talked to him.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.536
Oh.

27:05.711 --> 27:06.320
Satisfied?

27:06.494 --> 27:08.061
No, I'm not.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.932
First there's a robbery that
doesn't look like a robbery.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.847
Then a councilman
mysteriously vanishes,

27:12.021 --> 27:13.893
and both times,
one of you was there.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.372
Coincidence.

27:15.546 --> 27:18.071
I don't believe in coincidences.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.030
We'll keep in touch.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.517
Come on, Phoebe.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.737
There's got to be a way
out of here.

27:31.911 --> 27:33.521
Hey, give it a
rest, will you?

27:33.695 --> 27:34.827
You're tiring
out her body.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.132
Imara's gonna need her strength

27:36.306 --> 27:37.699
when she returns
to kill your sisters.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.571
Yeah?

27:40.746 --> 27:42.008
What makes you think

27:42.182 --> 27:43.487
I'd let any demon...

27:43.662 --> 27:44.837
[gasps and sighs]

27:47.927 --> 27:49.580
What's the matter with you?
Get up!

27:51.713 --> 27:53.106
What happened?

27:53.280 --> 27:54.934
What am I doing here?

27:55.108 --> 27:58.024
They've figured it out.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.373
They reversed the spell.

27:59.547 --> 28:00.896
Well, don't just

28:01.070 --> 28:03.029
stand there, you fools.
Let me out of here!

28:03.203 --> 28:05.335
What are you talking about?Don't you see?

28:05.509 --> 28:07.294
The witches switched
our souls back.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.338
It's me.

28:08.512 --> 28:09.600
Imara.

28:09.775 --> 28:10.645
Hurry! We don't
have much time!

28:10.819 --> 28:11.733
Open up and let me out.

28:11.907 --> 28:14.083
Wait!

28:14.257 --> 28:16.172
How do we know it's really you?

28:16.346 --> 28:18.218
You dare challenge me?

28:18.392 --> 28:20.089
Open the cage,

28:20.263 --> 28:21.787
or I'll kill you both!

28:21.961 --> 28:23.397
Same temper.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.007
Still, we've been
planning this for months,

28:25.181 --> 28:27.183
and they figure it out
in a couple of hours?

28:27.357 --> 28:29.838
I don't think so.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.274
They wouldn't have suspected
anything

28:31.448 --> 28:32.798
if you hadn't left
the scissors behind.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.321
That's right.

28:34.495 --> 28:35.409
You screwed up!

28:35.583 --> 28:36.802
Now let me out of here

28:36.976 --> 28:37.803
before they get here
and kill us all.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.369
Stay here.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.371
I'm gonna go above
ground, see for myself.

28:41.545 --> 28:42.938
Idiot!

28:43.112 --> 28:45.375
Phoebe will kill you
the moment she sees you.

28:45.549 --> 28:47.595
Unless you're Phoebe,
and this is just a trick.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.598
Don't let her out
until I return.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.515
The witches will vanquish him!

28:54.689 --> 28:56.473
Then they'll come back
and vanquish all of you

28:56.647 --> 28:58.737
unless you let me
out of here now.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.618
Hi.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.185
Get out.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.491
Nope, not going away
this time.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.495
And neither are you.

29:18.669 --> 29:21.063
Look, I know
why you stopped
using magic, okay?

29:21.237 --> 29:22.761
I did some research.

29:22.935 --> 29:23.936
You don't know anything.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.415
I know what happened.

29:25.589 --> 29:28.027
Leave me alone.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.376
You're not gonna
run from me

29:29.550 --> 29:30.899
like you've run
from all the others.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.596
Something happened
to your fiancée, right?

29:33.772 --> 29:34.947
Jennifer?

29:39.168 --> 29:40.996
I can do this all night.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.737
Why are you doing this to me?

29:42.911 --> 29:45.261
Look, I don't give a rat's ass

29:45.435 --> 29:47.437
about you being a witch or not.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.091
I'm just trying
to help you.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.877
You're not just running away
from your gift.

29:52.051 --> 29:53.269
You're running away
from yourself.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.142
You really loved her,
didn't you?

29:56.316 --> 29:59.319
Yes, I did.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.451
How did she die?

30:04.585 --> 30:06.065
I was supposed to meet her.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.328
I was late, I can't
remember why.

30:08.502 --> 30:12.201
By the time I got there,
they had already killed her.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.376
Demons.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.551
They didn't
want her.

30:14.725 --> 30:15.814
She didn't even

30:15.988 --> 30:19.643
know what they
were, who I was.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.951
They were there for
me, but I was late.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.040
If only I'd used my speed,
I might have been there

30:25.214 --> 30:27.042
on time to-to do s...You can't know that.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.914
You're never gonna
be able to know that.

30:29.088 --> 30:31.220
When my parents died,
I blamed myself.

30:31.394 --> 30:34.223
I even used magic to try
to go back in time and fix it.

30:34.397 --> 30:35.311
But I couldn't.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.878
And the thing is,

30:37.052 --> 30:38.619
we're never, ever, gonna
be able to fix everything

30:38.793 --> 30:41.578
or save everybody because
at the end of the day,

30:41.752 --> 30:44.146
you and I, we're just...

30:44.320 --> 30:46.366
people that have the ability
to help other people.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.116
Aren't you cold?

30:57.290 --> 31:00.032
No, but then again,
I actually have clothes on.

31:00.206 --> 31:01.642
Yeah, I know, it's
kind of skimpy.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.252
But it's just so cute,
I couldn't help myself.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.254
Okay, can we get
back to the demons?

31:05.428 --> 31:07.039
Right.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.779
You betcha.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.738
Let's see...

31:10.912 --> 31:12.696
[gasps]

31:12.871 --> 31:14.655
Benzor.

31:14.829 --> 31:15.743
Benzor?

31:15.917 --> 31:16.918
Upper level demon.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.398
I saw him posing
as a judge,

31:18.572 --> 31:20.574
and he probably is
working for Zankou, too.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.576
You got all that
from one premonition?

31:22.750 --> 31:24.447
Pretty good, huh?

31:24.621 --> 31:26.754
[cell phone ringing]

31:26.928 --> 31:28.930
You gonna get that?

31:29.104 --> 31:30.410
Your phone.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.628
Oh, right.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.589
[cell phone ringing]

31:39.071 --> 31:40.594
Hello.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.639
Dr. Randall?

31:42.813 --> 31:45.033
Oh, yes, Dr. Randall.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.513
[chuckles]

31:46.687 --> 31:47.775
You know what, just
do what you want,

31:47.949 --> 31:50.386
because I don't
really care.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.912
[baby crying]

31:54.086 --> 31:56.044
I'll be right back.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.224
What are you doing here?

32:02.398 --> 32:03.834
Imara?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.140
Well, who else
would it be?

32:05.314 --> 32:06.750
Why aren't you
watching the witch?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.536
She said they sent you
back to your body.

32:09.710 --> 32:10.667
I came to check.

32:10.841 --> 32:11.842
What?
PIPER:
Phoebe?

32:12.017 --> 32:13.018
Who are you
talking to?

32:13.192 --> 32:14.062
Piper, help!

32:14.236 --> 32:15.063
What are you doing?

32:15.237 --> 32:16.543
Covering.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.241
Blow him up.
No!

32:19.894 --> 32:21.809
[screams]

32:23.724 --> 32:25.160
Phew.

32:25.334 --> 32:26.683
That was close, huh?

32:26.857 --> 32:28.555
That was the demon
that attacked me in the club.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.687
And me in the elevator.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.211
Hey, what's up?

32:32.385 --> 32:34.126
Oh, Paige, good,
you're just in time.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.388
For what?

32:35.562 --> 32:36.911
To help us
vanquish the demon

32:37.085 --> 32:38.260
that's trying
to kill us.

32:38.434 --> 32:39.914
How do you know who it is?

32:40.088 --> 32:43.831
Well, the demon we just
vanquished said her name.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.964
It's, uh...

32:49.141 --> 32:51.273
Imara.

32:51.447 --> 32:53.449
We have to vanquish her
right away.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.803
MINION:
I can't let you out.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.109
She'll kill me.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.067
She is me!

33:02.241 --> 33:03.720
But Lantos said you...

33:03.894 --> 33:05.113
Lantos is dead.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.897
Otherwise, he would have
returned by now.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.769
I don't know.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.293
If you do nothing, you'll be
vanquished by the witches.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.947
But if you free me,

33:13.121 --> 33:16.342
you'll take Lantos's place
and rule by my side.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.179
You made a wise decision.

33:30.921 --> 33:33.272
Phoebe, no.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.190
Well, it took you long enough.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.583
Actually, I think
we're right on time.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.107
No, don't!

33:42.716 --> 33:44.326
[screaming]

33:50.593 --> 33:52.508
What was that?

33:52.682 --> 33:54.945
That was Phoebe's soul.

33:56.251 --> 33:58.036
We just killed your sister.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.698
PIPER:
I told you it was
a soul swap, didn't I?

34:08.872 --> 34:11.136
Look, I don't think right now
is the time for "I told you so."

34:11.310 --> 34:13.529
No, I think now is
the perfect time, actually.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.531
There was obviously
something wrong with her.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.185
Why didn't I
do something?

34:17.359 --> 34:19.840
I don't think beating yourself
up is gonna do any good.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.668
Besides, how could
we have known?

34:21.842 --> 34:23.844
You know, she took over
Phoebe's body to kill demons.

34:24.018 --> 34:24.888
That's what
Phoebe does.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.934
No, not lately it isn't.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.589
Not with everything going on
at work with her.

34:29.763 --> 34:30.677
I should have done something.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.461
I can't believe I didn't...

34:32.635 --> 34:33.897
PAIGE:All right, we should
just concentrate

34:34.072 --> 34:35.029
on getting her back, okay?

34:35.203 --> 34:36.161
PIPER:
Back?

34:36.335 --> 34:38.337
Paige, her soul floated away.

34:38.511 --> 34:39.816
She's gone.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.296
Not necessarily.

34:41.470 --> 34:42.558
I mean, we've dealt
with spirits before.

34:42.732 --> 34:43.994
We know that

34:44.169 --> 34:45.126
they can keep themselves
from moving on

34:45.300 --> 34:46.258
if their will is strong enough.

34:46.432 --> 34:48.608
Phoebe's definitely is.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.784
Okay, fine, great,
but Imara is still in her body,

34:50.958 --> 34:53.439
and I don't see her
in a big hurry to give it up.

34:53.613 --> 34:54.831
Yeah, especially since

34:55.005 --> 34:56.442
we blew up her
demonic body.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.270
Not that I'm saying
it's anybody's fault.

34:59.793 --> 35:00.968
You could always do
another soul swap:

35:01.142 --> 35:02.274
put Phoebe's soul
back in her body

35:02.448 --> 35:03.449
and send Imara's essence
to, uh...

35:03.623 --> 35:05.059
What, oblivion?

35:05.233 --> 35:06.539
Yeah, you just have to do
the same ritual again.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.367
That requires a piece
of Phoebe's hair.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.282
And I don't see
Imara letting us

35:10.456 --> 35:11.674
get close enough to try.

35:11.848 --> 35:14.460
No, but I think I might know

35:14.634 --> 35:16.766
somebody who can.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.863
Thomas Hendricks.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.213
Where'd you come from?

35:28.387 --> 35:29.649
Judge Thomas Hendricks?

35:29.823 --> 35:31.607
Who are you?

35:31.781 --> 35:33.435
Someone who doesn't want
to work for your boss.

35:34.697 --> 35:35.829
Zankou.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.702
[screaming]

35:39.876 --> 35:41.487
Damn, that was my
favorite minion.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.185
[screaming]

35:44.359 --> 35:45.795
All right, who's next?

35:46.622 --> 35:47.623
Thanks.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.671
[cauldron bubbling]

35:56.458 --> 35:58.199
[panting]

35:58.373 --> 35:59.244
She's pretty pissed.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.506
[chuckling]

36:00.680 --> 36:01.724
Thanks.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.726
Ooh!

36:03.900 --> 36:06.468
Wait.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.122
Now.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.471
PIPER AND PAIGE:
"Lock of hair,

36:09.645 --> 36:10.907
"completes our goal
to help us reclaim

36:11.081 --> 36:11.908
"our sister's soul.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.649
"Banish this demon,

36:13.823 --> 36:16.957
spare no pain, bring Phoebe back
from the ghostly plane."

36:28.055 --> 36:28.882
[Imara screaming]

36:29.056 --> 36:31.101
[screaming]

36:37.107 --> 36:39.022
Whoa.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.067
Ooh.

36:40.241 --> 36:41.416
You okay?

36:41.590 --> 36:43.113
No, I am not okay!

36:43.288 --> 36:44.767
How could you not know
that thing was inside me?!

36:44.941 --> 36:45.899
Oh, don't start
with me!

36:46.073 --> 36:48.336
Who's this guy?

36:48.510 --> 36:51.383
This is, um,
my first charge, Mitchell.

36:51.557 --> 36:52.427
He saved you.

36:52.601 --> 36:55.822
Oh... thank you.

36:55.996 --> 36:58.041
Oh, don't thank me,
thank my whitelighter.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.260
She saved me.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.131
He's cute.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.786
PIPER AND PAIGE:
She's back.

37:24.894 --> 37:27.157
Ooh, do I even
want to read this?

37:27.332 --> 37:28.724
Don't see why not,

37:28.898 --> 37:29.899
considering it's word for word
what you wrote.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.815
Dr. Randall is no longer
with the paper.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.295
Really?

37:34.469 --> 37:35.514
Did you fire him?

37:35.688 --> 37:37.603
He didn't leave me much choice.

37:37.777 --> 37:40.562
He, uh, he claimed
you came on to him.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.738
[chuckles]:
I did?

37:42.912 --> 37:43.870
Exactly.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.828
And that was just his first lie.

37:46.002 --> 37:48.440
He also said you told him he
could do whatever he wanted

37:48.614 --> 37:49.832
to do with the column,

37:50.006 --> 37:51.660
that you didn't care
one way or the other.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.793
Oh, well, he must have me
confused with someone else.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.447
Which is exactly

37:55.621 --> 37:57.492
what I said when I kicked
his butt out the door.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.015
That's fine by me.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.887
So are you gonna be
hiring someone else?

38:01.061 --> 38:03.542
I told legal we never had a
problem with your column before,

38:03.716 --> 38:06.022
and until we do, back off.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.938
I appreciate that vote
of confidence, Elise.

38:09.112 --> 38:12.072
But I've been thinking,
and maybe my column could use

38:12.246 --> 38:13.378
a little bit more
professional insight.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.423
How so?

38:15.597 --> 38:18.078
I'll let you know.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.819
Got to run it by
my sisters first.

Potions?

38:38.403 --> 38:40.535
Spells?

38:40.709 --> 38:42.102
Even better-- husband.

38:42.276 --> 38:45.061
Ooh, getting Leo to go
back to work.

38:45.235 --> 38:46.585
Nothing says normal
quite like that.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.021
And, hey,
we haven't had

38:48.195 --> 38:49.936
a demon attack all day.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.765
Well, hopefully ,the demon world
took note of our rampage.

38:52.939 --> 38:56.029
I don't think killing Imara
constitutes a rampage.

38:56.203 --> 38:58.945
No, but killing Imara,
Daleek and Benzor does.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.903
Okay, we didn't kill
the last two.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.165
Yeah, but the demon world
doesn't know that.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.602
PHOEBE:
No, they just think

39:03.776 --> 39:05.038
I did it.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.996
Which is fine
by me actually.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.433
Me, too.[sighs]:Okay.

39:08.607 --> 39:09.912
So, you guys
want to know

39:10.086 --> 39:11.523
what the real Phoebe
is gonna do next?

39:11.697 --> 39:13.220
What?

39:13.394 --> 39:15.135
I've decided that I'm
gonna go back to college.

39:15.309 --> 39:17.529
College? Again?

39:17.703 --> 39:20.532
Yeah, I think I want
to get my graduate degree.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.272
This way, the paper
will get off my back,

39:22.447 --> 39:24.274
and I can actually get my
professional credentials,

39:24.449 --> 39:28.453
and who knows, maybe even
be a better columnist.

39:28.627 --> 39:29.932
What happened to
the woman who said

39:30.106 --> 39:32.108
her readers don't care
about credentials?

39:32.282 --> 39:33.849
Well, as a future psychologist,

39:34.023 --> 39:36.939
um, I can honestly say
that I...

39:37.113 --> 39:38.114
Was swimming in
a big bag of denial?

39:38.288 --> 39:39.768
Yes, exactly.

39:39.942 --> 39:41.509
What about the shrink at work?

39:41.683 --> 39:43.772
I don't think
he'll be a problem anymore.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.295
Well, girls,

39:45.470 --> 39:47.428
unfortunately,
I think Inspector Sheridan

39:47.602 --> 39:48.647
is going to be a problem.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.518
Wait, she's on our case again?

40:05.446 --> 40:07.230
No. What?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.710
He disappeared, too.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.843
Must be an epidemic.

40:11.017 --> 40:13.149
It must be.

If you need a hand with
the councilman's case,

40:15.151 --> 40:16.457
just let me know.
