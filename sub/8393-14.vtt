08:56.360 --> 08:57.873
- IS THAT MORTENSON?
- THROUGH THEM YOURSELF--MM-HMM.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.800
- THAT'S TODAY, RIGHT?
THEY WEREN'T--THEY DIDN'T--

08:59.910 --> 09:01.320
- THE MESSENGER'S COMING
AT 4:00 TO PICK 'EM UP, YES.

09:01.430 --> 09:02.704
- [sighs]
4:00?

09:02.810 --> 09:04.118
- UH-HUH.
I CAN MOVE IT.

09:04.230 --> 09:06.573
- NO, LEAVE IT.
I LIKE A--I LIKE A DEADLINE.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.159
- [chuckles]

09:08.270 --> 09:12.058
HEY, SO, UM, ALSO TOMORROW,
I'M GONNA HAVE COFFEE WITH MARK.

09:12.170 --> 09:14.923
- [chuckles]
REALLY?

09:15.030 --> 09:17.510
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
IT'S JUST COFFEE,

09:17.620 --> 09:18.609
BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

09:18.730 --> 09:22.314
- ALL RIGHT.
HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT?

09:22.420 --> 09:27.665
- HE ASKED AND JUST WANTED
TO CLEAR THE AIR AND...

09:27.770 --> 09:31.183
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT, I MEAN--
- HAVE CLOSURE.

09:31.290 --> 09:32.382
- HMM.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.661
- IS THAT FUNNY?
- NO, IT'S A LITTLE--

09:34.780 --> 09:36.668
I MEAN--THE WHOLE THING'S
A LITTLE WEIRD,

09:36.780 --> 09:37.917
BUT, UM, THAT'S,
YOU KNOW, IT'S YOUR--

09:38.020 --> 09:40.739
- OF COUR--
IT'S WEIRD FOR ME TOO,

09:40.850 --> 09:42.056
BUT I THOUGHT
I SHOULD TELL YOU.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.913
- I GUESS--
I GUESS TO EACH HIS OWN.

09:45.030 --> 09:47.612
- WHAT?
- I JUST DON'T, UH--

09:47.720 --> 09:50.132
- YOU WOULDN'T DO IT?

09:53.100 --> 09:55.898
- LOOK, DO WHAT
YOU GOTTA DO, I GUESS.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.104
ALL RIGHT?

10:00.220 --> 10:01.244
- 15 GUYS WAITING ON US.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.386
SO--BUT IF YOU CAN'T
GET ME LUMBER BY MONDAY,

10:03.490 --> 10:06.664
TELL ME NOW, BECAUSE
I'M GONNA FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN.

10:06.770 --> 10:09.568
OKAY, WELL, F-FIGURE IT OUT
AND CALL ME BACK.

10:09.670 --> 10:10.705
HEY.
- SORRY IF THIS ISN'T

10:10.810 --> 10:12.562
A GOOD TIME, I JUST--
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.773
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

10:14.890 --> 10:17.643
- UH, I'D LIKE TO HAVE
MY JOB BACK, PLEASE.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.641
- UH...

10:21.750 --> 10:23.991
LOOK, UH, RYAN,
I'M SURE YOU'RE A GREAT GUY,

10:24.100 --> 10:26.751
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I SAY WE JUST CHALK IT UP

10:26.860 --> 10:29.340
TO A SITUATION
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT, YOU KNOW?

10:29.450 --> 10:32.317
BUT IF YOU NEED REFERENCES,
I'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU ONE.

10:32.420 --> 10:36.038
- NO, I DON'T NEED--
I DON'T NEED A REFERENCE,

10:36.150 --> 10:38.835
LIKE YOUR SYMPATHY
OR WHATEVER.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.589
I KNOW THAT I MESSED
SOMETHING UP.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.871
I SHOULDN'T HAVE WALKED OFF,

10:41.980 --> 10:43.288
AND I KNOW THAT I COST YOU
A LOT OF MONEY.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.947
I'M COMING BACK TO YOU TO SAY...
- THAT'S OKAY.

10:45.050 --> 10:46.563
- TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHAT I DID.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.772
- LOOK, THESE THINGS
HAPPEN ON SITES.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.677
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- SO LET ME FIX IT.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.156
YOU CAN DOCK MY PAY.

10:51.270 --> 10:53.261
I'LL WORK FOR FREE
UNTIL IT'S PAID OFF.

10:53.370 --> 10:54.359
- I'M SORRY.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.439
THE ANSWER IS NO.

10:58.550 --> 10:59.858
- I DON'T EVEN
GET A CHANCE TO--

10:59.960 --> 11:01.166
DON'T YOU SEE
THAT I'M TRYING TO FIX IT HERE?

11:01.280 --> 11:02.998
- YOU HAD A CHANCE.
YOU HAD A CHANCE, RYAN.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.554
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME...
- WOW, OKAY.

11:04.660 --> 11:07.242
- TO TRAIN SOMEBODY.

11:07.350 --> 11:08.169
- ALL RIGHT.

11:21.330 --> 11:22.433
- AMBER?

11:22.540 --> 11:26.601
I THINK THAT DOUGH
IS FLAT ENOUGH.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.644
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:29.750 --> 11:31.854
- YEAH, I'M OKAY.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.679
I'M JUST, LIKE,
THINKING ABOUT SOME THINGS.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.894
- YEAH.
RYAN?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.308
YEAH.

11:38.420 --> 11:42.129
WHAT, HAS HE BEEN CALLING YOU
AT 3:00 AM. TOO?

11:42.250 --> 11:43.478
- NO.

11:43.590 --> 11:44.522
WHY?
DID HE CALL YOU GUYS?

11:44.630 --> 11:49.317
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
ZEEK'S BEEN...

11:49.430 --> 11:50.351
WORKING WITH HIM.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.870
YOU KNOW, LOOKING OUT FOR HIM.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.538
- AND THAT SOUNDS BAD.
IS IT--IS HE OKAY?

11:53.640 --> 11:54.493
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

11:54.610 --> 11:55.679
HE'S--NO, HE'S FINE.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.873
HE'S MOVING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.708
HE JUST STILL HAS AN AWFUL LOT
OF STUFF TO WORK OUT,

11:59.820 --> 12:03.369
THAT'S ALL.

12:03.480 --> 12:09.680
- I WISH THERE WAS ANYTHING
I COULD DO TO HELP HIM.

12:09.790 --> 12:13.169
- WELL, TRY NOT TO MAKE IT
YOUR BURDEN.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.169
IT'S NOT.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.008
YOU KNOW?

12:17.110 --> 12:18.589
TAKE IT OFF THOSE SHOULDERS.

12:18.700 --> 12:23.524
AND, UH, COME ON, LET'S GET
THESE PIES IN THE OVEN.

12:23.630 --> 12:25.700
COME ON.
[snaps fingers]

12:25.810 --> 12:26.902
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
I'M READY.

12:27.020 --> 12:31.184
- OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.746
GOOD NIGHT.

12:33.850 --> 12:37.911
I LOVE YOU.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.837
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I SAID.

13:00.950 --> 13:02.349
ALL THESE KIDS ARE GOING TO...
- HEY. WHAT? UH--

13:02.470 --> 13:04.119
- THE CONVENIENCE STORE TO BUY A
BUNCH OF JUNK, WHICH OUR KIDS--

13:04.230 --> 13:05.424
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
[baby drums]

13:05.540 --> 13:06.768
YOU DRUMMING?
- YEAH--ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL

13:06.880 --> 13:07.847
OR COMING BACK FROM SCHOOL,

13:07.950 --> 13:08.848
THEY'RE BUYING
A BUNCH OF JUNK.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.052
AND THEY'RE SPENDING MONEY

13:10.160 --> 13:11.604
AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE
ANYWAY.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.982
SO WHY NOT JUST PUT IT
INTO OUR SCHOOL

13:13.100 --> 13:16.331
AND HAVE
HEALTHIER SNACK--EXACT LY.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.439
THANKS SO MUCH, EILEEN.

13:17.550 --> 13:18.710
I WILL CALL YOU TOMORROW,

13:18.830 --> 13:20.991
AND TELL GLADYS THE WAR IS ON.

13:21.110 --> 13:23.624
- WOW.
- OH, YEAH.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.038
- THE WAR ROOM.
- IT'S GO TIME.

13:25.140 --> 13:26.937
- IS THIS, UH, IS THIS
WHAT I THINK IT'S ABOUT?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.031
- I'M JUST TRYING TO GATHER
SOME INFORMATION...

13:29.150 --> 13:31.141
- YEAH? VENDING-GATE?
- FOR THE PTA MEETING.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.047
- OH, I SEE, YOU'RE GONNA GO
INTO THIS PTA MEETING

13:33.150 --> 13:33.946
AS A LOBBYIST
FOR CANDY AND CHOCOLATE.

13:34.050 --> 13:35.324
- UH-HUH. IAM.
- UH-HUH.

13:35.430 --> 13:38.251
- YOU SAY IT
LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.463
I'M GOING IN TO--
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

13:39.570 --> 13:41.014
WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF CANDY AND CHOCOLATE.

13:41.130 --> 13:42.438
- RIGHT?
- I'M JUST TRYING

13:42.540 --> 13:43.882
TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING HERE,

13:43.990 --> 13:45.810
BECAUSE MAX WILL BE OKAY

13:45.920 --> 13:46.887
IF HE DOESN'T GET
THE VENDING MACHINE BACK.

13:46.990 --> 13:49.379
- YEAH, I KNOW
HE'LL BE OKAY, ADAM.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.640
THIS IS THE ONE THING
THAT I CAN HAVE CONTROL OVER

13:50.760 --> 13:54.924
AND HELP WITH, AND I'M NOT
LETTING THIS DIE FOR HIM.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.441
SO THERE YOU GO.
- OKAY.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.586
- HEY.
- OH, HEY.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.031
- YOU READING COMIC BOOKS?

14:03.150 --> 14:05.596
- YEAH, I'M TRYING TO STAY
RELEVANT IN JABBAR'S LIFE

14:05.700 --> 14:07.349
BY KEEPING UP
WITH THE COOL STUFF.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.381
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

14:08.500 --> 14:11.151
- UH, HE'S AT A PLAYDATE
WITH MILES.

14:11.260 --> 14:13.319
AND YOUR MOTHER--
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS--

14:13.430 --> 14:17.264
IS GROCERY SHOPPING FOR HEALTHY
AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD FOR HIM

14:17.370 --> 14:19.577
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T FEEL
THERE WAS ANY IN THE HOUSE.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.669
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.542
- NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.
- OH, GOD.

14:22.650 --> 14:24.060
- I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
BUMP INTO HER THERE

14:24.170 --> 14:25.751
UNLESS SHE WENT
TO SOME CRAZY ORGANIC JOINT.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.373
- [chuckles]

14:27.480 --> 14:28.378
BABY, I'M SORRY.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.414
I KNOW BEING CRITICIZED
IS NOT FUN

14:30.520 --> 14:32.374
AND MY MOTHER
IS A MASTER AT IT, SO--

14:32.490 --> 14:34.890
- LOOK, IF SHE WANTS
TO CRITICIZE US

14:35.010 --> 14:36.216
ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS THING,
I GET IT.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.389
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HER.

14:37.490 --> 14:38.479
BUT HER MICROMANAGING

14:38.600 --> 14:39.350
WHAT WE'RE FEEDING OUR SON?

14:39.460 --> 14:41.621
I'M NOT COOL WITH IT.
- I KNOW.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.184
- LOOK, WE'RE THE PARENTS.

14:43.290 --> 14:45.281
IF WE WANNA FEED HIM MOTOR OIL
FOR BREAKFAST, WE CAN DO THAT.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.321
THAT'S OUR RIGHT.

14:46.430 --> 14:46.919
SHE HAD, YOU KNOW,
HER CHANCE WITH YOU.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.113
- [chuckles]

14:49.230 --> 14:51.016
- WE NEED TO TALK TO HER.

14:51.130 --> 14:54.258
- I--YOU KNOW, I REALLY
DON'T WANNA ARGUE WITH HER

14:54.370 --> 14:56.190
ABOUT THIS STUFF, YOU KNOW?
IT'S NOT--

14:56.300 --> 14:57.995
- OKAY, I'M NOT SUGGESTING
THAT WE ARGUE WITH HER,

14:58.100 --> 14:59.442
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS
AS TWO ADULTS

14:59.550 --> 15:00.892
WE NEED TO SIT DOWN
WITH HER AND GO,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.444
"HEY, HERE ARE OUR BOUNDARIES
AS PARENTS.

15:02.550 --> 15:05.519
WE DON'T WANT TO BE CRITICIZED
EVERY MORNING WHEN WE WAKE UP."

15:05.620 --> 15:06.939
THAT'S FAIR.

15:07.040 --> 15:11.340
NO FIGHTING, JUST, HEY,
HERE ARE OUR--YOU KNOW.

15:11.460 --> 15:12.791
- NO FIGHTING?

15:12.910 --> 15:15.242
- ABSOLUTELY NO FIGHTING.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.521
- YOU PROMISE?
- I PROMISE.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.461
- I-I HAD ABOUT A FULL MINUTE
OF THINKING AT FIRST

15:20.570 --> 15:23.778
THAT THIS KID IS,
LIKE, A SECRET GENIUS.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.054
LIKE, HE JUST--HE HASN'T HAD
ANYTHING TO OFFER IN CLASS.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.775
- SUDDENLY. MAYBE
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR TEACHING.

15:28.890 --> 15:30.778
- YEAH, I'VE--I'VE--
I'VE OPENED HIM UP.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.096
- HE JUST REALLY--YEAH, YEAH.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.508
- AND THEN THE FURTHER
I GOT INTO HIS ESSAY,

15:33.620 --> 15:35.679
I STARTED TO RECOGNIZE
SOME OF THE IDEAS.

15:35.790 --> 15:38.372
IT'S THE ESSAY THAT HAROLD BLOOM
WROTE IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.176
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY THINK THEY
CAN JUST GET AWAY WITH THAT.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.656
- I WONDER IF THAT HAPPENS
IN PHOTOGRAPHY.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.558
IF, YOU KNOW, IF--I DON'T KNOW,
PEOPLE FIND SOME OLD PRINT

15:45.660 --> 15:47.969
AND TRY TO PRETEND
IT'S THEIRS OR SOMETHING.

15:48.080 --> 15:48.978
- I'M SURE...
- YEAH.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.069
- IF YOU HAVE THE NEGATIVES,

15:50.190 --> 15:51.214
I GUESS YOU COULD
PROVE IT THAT WAY.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.639
- NOBODY USES NEGATIVES ANYMORE.

15:52.740 --> 15:53.900
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
DIGITAL.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.567
- IT'S ALMOST A DIFFERENT ART,
YOU KNOW, TO DO.

15:55.670 --> 15:58.230
- IT IS. YEAH.
- HAVE TO LEARN BOTH OF THEM.

15:58.330 --> 16:01.128
- BEEN LEARNING A LOT
ABOUT IT.

16:01.230 --> 16:03.710
HOW'S THAT--
HOW'S THAT ALL BEEN GOING?

16:03.820 --> 16:04.718
- GOOD.
- YEAH?

16:04.820 --> 16:05.718
- MM-HMM.
- GOOD.

16:05.820 --> 16:10.473
IS--HOW'S HANK?

16:10.590 --> 16:11.614
- GOOD.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.349
- YOU GUYS ARE STILL
SEEING EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

16:15.450 --> 16:18.453
_ UM--
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

16:18.560 --> 16:23.111
- NO, BUT I--UH, WE'RE SEEING
EACH OTHER, I GUESS.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.939
UM, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
THE TIMING

16:26.050 --> 16:26.948
I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN AND...

16:27.050 --> 16:30.463
- MM-HMM.
- IT'S...

16:30.570 --> 16:33.152
- WHEN I--WHEN I HEARD
ABOUT IT, I WAS A LITTLE...

16:33.260 --> 16:34.500
- OF COURSE.
- SURPRISED AND I GOT--

16:34.610 --> 16:37.158
- BUT EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU,
YOU KNOW,

16:37.270 --> 16:38.407
I WASN'T--
THERE WAS NO OVERLAP.

16:38.510 --> 16:41.024
THERE WAS NO SNEAKING AROUND.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.018
IT'S--I JUST--
AND IT DIDN'T HAVE--

16:43.140 --> 16:44.949
IT'S NOT THE REASON THAT...
- YEAH.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.038
- YOU KNOW, WE--
- WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S. ..

16:47.140 --> 16:49.552
THAT'S NICE TO HEAR.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.059
I BELIEVED YOU,
I JUST, YOU KNOW--

16:51.180 --> 16:52.966
- YEAH.
- BY MYSELF, Al-TERWARDS,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.344
I STARTED TO QUESTION
EVERYTHING, BUT NO.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.792
THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME THAT.

16:57.910 --> 17:01.732
- THERE WAS THIS THING IN THE
DARK ROOM THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.355
BUT HE KISSED ME--
WE WERE DEVELOPING A PHOTOGRAPH.

17:05.470 --> 17:07.700
I BARELY KNEW HIM AND--HE--
IT WAS N--IT WAS QUICK

17:07.810 --> 17:11.917
AND THIS ODD THING AND I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE--

17:12.030 --> 17:12.951
- WH--THIS IS WHILE
WE WERE TOGETHER?

17:13.060 --> 17:15.051
- YEAH, BUT NOW
WHEN I LOOK BACK,

17:15.170 --> 17:16.649
I THINK, OH,
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

17:16.750 --> 17:20.686
AND H SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THERE WAS SOMETHING

17:20.790 --> 17:21.859
AT LEAST ON HIS END,
YOU KNOW?

17:21.970 --> 17:24.416
- YEAH, ON HIS END.
- THAT I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU...

17:24.520 --> 17:25.896
THAT PART.

17:26.010 --> 17:27.625
- YEAH.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.592
- WELL, AS WE GET INTO
THIS COMPLETION PROCESS

17:33.700 --> 17:35.497
AND MOVE TOWARDS FINALIZING
VICTOR'S ADOPTION,

17:35.600 --> 17:38.160
I NEED ANSWERS
TO A FEW QUESTIONS

17:38.260 --> 17:39.943
SO WE CAN SET A HEARING DATE.

17:40.050 --> 17:41.529
ONCE THE DATE'S BEEN SET,

17:41.640 --> 17:43.289
YOU'LL APPEAR IN COURT
WITH VICTOR

17:43.400 --> 17:44.742
FOR A FINALIZATION HEARING,

17:44.850 --> 17:46.772
AND YOU WILL BE GRANTED
THE ORDER OF ADOPTION.

17:46.890 --> 17:48.505
- WOW. AMAZING.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.235
- ALL RIGHT.

17:49.340 --> 17:51.479
- AND VICTOR'S DOING WELL?

17:51.580 --> 17:52.615
- HE IS.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.517
HE REALLY IS, YEAH.
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

17:54.620 --> 17:58.340
- I'M WAITING FOR HE AND SYDNEY
TO FIND THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

17:58.450 --> 18:01.032
YOU KNOW, FIND THAT--
THAT KIND OF SIBLING RHYTHM.

18:01.140 --> 18:02.459
- WELL, THEY'RE GETTING THERE.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.243
- THEY'RE NOT THERE YET, YEAH.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.590
- WELL--
- BUT--YEAH.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.077
- HE'S INTO BASEBALL.
HE'S A SHORTSTOP.

18:08.190 --> 18:12.183
UM, HE, UH, HAS MADE A LOT OF
REALLY GREAT FRIENDS AT SCHOOL.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.349
- FANTASTIC.
- HE'S A GRADE BEHIND IN MATH.

18:14.470 --> 18:15.630
- YEAH, BUT HE USED TO BE
TWO GRADES BEHIND,

18:15.740 --> 18:19.267
SO THAT'S NOT AS BIG A DEAL
AS IT WAS.

18:19.370 --> 18:21.292
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.025
- WELL, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

18:23.130 --> 18:24.540
VICTOR'S ADJUSTMENT
TO YOUR HOME?

18:24.650 --> 18:27.710
- IT'S BEEN GREAT--
- OH, WELL...

18:27.830 --> 18:30.230
YEAH, IT'S--IT'S--IT'S GOOD.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.342
IT'S--THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME BUMPS IN THE ROAD.

18:33.450 --> 18:35.247
- WELL, THAT'S NORMAL.

18:35.350 --> 18:36.931
- THAT'S WHAT I KEEP SAYING.
- RIGHT.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.246
- IT'S ABSOLUTELY NORMAL.

18:38.350 --> 18:39.829
UH, YOU KNOW,
HE'S A GREAT KID.

18:39.940 --> 18:44.900
HE'S, UH, REALLY FUNNY
AND HE'S A LITTLE SHY AT FIRST,

18:45.020 --> 18:46.044
BUT HE'S NOT WITHDRAWN.

18:46.150 --> 18:47.970
HE'S JUST--
- HE DOESN'T LOVE ME.

18:48.090 --> 18:50.399
- JULIA.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.910
- IT'S A RELEVANT STATEMENT
THAT I WANNA MAKE,

18:52.020 --> 18:54.818
AND IT'S A CONCERN THAT I HAVE
AND IT'S BEEN ONGOING.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.262
- IT'S A--
- YOU KNOW THIS.

18:56.370 --> 18:57.223
- IT'S A FEELING YOU HAVE.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.364
- IT'S NOT
A FEELING THAT I HAVE.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.708
HE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING

18:59.820 --> 19:01.264
TO THE EFFECT OF HAVING
ANY AFFECTION FOR ME.

19:01.380 --> 19:02.233
- HE'S NOT GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING--HE'S A BOY.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.228
- WELL, ANY KIND
OF AFFECT ION WHATSOEVER.

19:04.350 --> 19:06.068
AND I KNOW WE KEEP SAYING
HE NEEDS MORE TIME,

19:06.170 --> 19:07.558
BUT JUST HOW MUCH MORE TIME--

19:07.660 --> 19:08.991
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK THE TWO OF YOU

19:09.110 --> 19:11.271
NEED TO TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

19:11.390 --> 19:12.652
- I DON'T THINK--NO, NO.
- THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.

19:12.770 --> 19:13.907
- I DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO DO THAT.

19:14.010 --> 19:14.931
- UH, FROM WHERE I SIT,

19:15.050 --> 19:17.189
IT NEVER HURTS
TO TAKE THE TIME,

19:17.290 --> 19:20.214
BECAUSE ADOPTION
IS A VERY BIG DEAL.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.560
AND JUST TO SAY, YOU WOULDN'T
BE THE FIRST PEOPLE

19:22.670 --> 19:24.638
IN THE WORLD
TO CHANGE YOUR MINDS.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.159
- HEY, MOM.
- OH.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.488
OH, IT'S UNUSUAL THAT YOU BOTH
ARE HOME SO EARLY.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.387
- YEAH, I EVEN GOT TO
PICK HER UP FROM SCHOOL.

19:44.490 --> 19:45.457
- YEAH.
- OH, NICE.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.448
- MOM, WE'D LIKE TO TALK
TO YOU

19:47.560 --> 19:49.073
ABOUT SOMETHING
IF NOW'S A GOOD TIME.

19:49.180 --> 19:52.900
- ABSOLUTELY.

19:53.010 --> 19:55.945
- YEAH.

19:56.050 --> 19:57.324
- GO AHEAD.
- [mumbles]

19:57.430 --> 20:01.434
UM, YEAH, WE WERE THINKING--
YOU KNOW, BOTH OF US

20:01.540 --> 20:04.293
HAVE BEEN THINKING THAT, UM--

20:04.410 --> 20:06.469
YOU KNOW WHAT,
BEFORE WE EVEN GET INTO THAT,

20:06.580 --> 20:08.684
I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WE LOVE
HAVING YOU HERE.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.609
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S BEEN
REALLY FUN.

20:09.720 --> 20:10.687
- YES. WE DO.
WE LOVE IT, MOM.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.473
- THANK YOU.
I LOVE BEING HERE.

20:12.590 --> 20:14.990
- GREAT.
YEAH, WE REALLY LIKE IT.

20:15.110 --> 20:18.625
UM, WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT
IT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES.

20:18.730 --> 20:21.585
UM...

20:21.700 --> 20:22.621
- IS THIS ABOUT THE BATHROOM?

20:22.730 --> 20:24.664
- NO, IT'S NOT.
[all chuckle]

20:24.770 --> 20:28.422
NO, IT'S, UM, IT'S ABOUT
JABBAR SPECIFICALLY.

20:28.530 --> 20:29.667
- YES.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.044
- THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES
WHERE WE FELT CRITICIZED.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.505
UM, THE OTHER MORNING
AT BREAKFAST.

20:35.610 --> 20:39.649
- SO YOU'RE UPSET
BECAUSE I POINTED OUT

20:39.750 --> 20:43.379
THAT JABBAR SHOULDN'T BE
SUBSISTING ON SUGAR AND STARCH?

20:43.480 --> 20:44.754
- WELL--
- NOT--

20:44.860 --> 20:47.237
- WE FEED HIM OTHER THINGS.
- WE DO.

20:47.340 --> 20:48.477
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

20:48.590 --> 20:50.922
SO YOU DO KNOW
THAT I JUST HAVE

20:51.040 --> 20:53.383
MY GRANDSON'S BEST INTERESTS
AT HEART, RIGHT?

20:53.490 --> 20:55.242
- OF COURSE, OF COURSE, MOM.
WE KNOW THAT.

20:55.350 --> 20:57.489
- NOBODY'S QUESTIONING
YOUR LOVE FOR JABBAR

20:57.600 --> 20:58.908
OR YOUR DEDICATION TO HIM.

20:59.010 --> 21:00.875
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS
IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY NICE

21:00.980 --> 21:05.735
TO BE JUDGED EVERY TIME
WE MAKE A DECISION.

21:05.850 --> 21:08.159
IT'S NOT A NICE FEELING.

21:08.260 --> 21:10.228
- OKAY.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.469
- ALL RIGHT.
- WELL, I--WELL, I'M SORRY.

21:12.580 --> 21:13.774
OKAY?

21:13.890 --> 21:15.050
I'M SORRY.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.546
IS THAT OKAY?

21:16.650 --> 21:17.719
- YEAH.

21:17.820 --> 21:22.098
- BUT I GO'ITA TELL YOU
THAT FROM OVER HERE,

21:22.210 --> 21:24.849
SOMETIMES IT APPEARS LIKE THE
INMATES ARE RUNNING THE ASYLUM.

21:24.970 --> 21:27.518
- OH, IS THAT WHAT IT...
- MOM, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

21:27.630 --> 21:28.619
- APPEARS LIKE TO YOU?

21:28.730 --> 21:30.140
- WELL, I KNOW--
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.478
- FROM YOUR LOl-TY PERCH OF--

21:31.600 --> 21:34.319
- JABBAR SHOULD BE IN BED

21:34.430 --> 21:38.594
AT 8:00 DURING WEEKNIGHTS,
PERIOD, RIGHT?

21:38.710 --> 21:40.598
- HE--WHAT--HE IS IN BED...
- HE IS, HE IS.

21:40.710 --> 21:41.802
- EVERY NIGHT AT 8:00
ON WEEKNIGHTS.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.502
- YES, UNLESS HE ASKS
TO SEE A MOVIE WITH YOU.

21:44.610 --> 21:47.499
- OKAY, THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE
OF TIMES WHEN THAT'S HAPPENED,

21:47.610 --> 21:48.838
BUT THAT'S NOT THE NORM.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.404
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE
THE EXCEPTION THE NORM,

21:50.510 --> 21:51.647
AND THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.752
I DON'T NEED TO BE IN
A SHOUTING MATCH WITH YOU

21:53.860 --> 21:55.202
ABOUT JABBAR'S BED TIME.
- NO ONE'S SHOUTING.

21:55.310 --> 21:56.334
- THAT'S OUR DECISION.

21:56.450 --> 21:58.338
- ARE YOU AWARE
THAT FOR FIVE YEARS

21:58.450 --> 22:00.611
BEFORE YOU CAME INTO
JABBAR'S LIFE,

22:00.730 --> 22:04.006
THERE WAS A SYSTEM OF DISCIPLINE
BECAUSE KIDS NEED DISCIPLINE.

22:04.110 --> 22:07.386
- DISCIPLINE WILL BE
ADMINISTERED THE WAY WE SEE FIT,

22:07.490 --> 22:08.900
NOT THE WAY YOU SEE FIT.

22:09.010 --> 22:10.113
THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA GO DOWN,
OKAY?

22:10.220 --> 22:11.426
- JUST EVERYONE--

22:11.530 --> 22:12.519
- WE DON'T NEED TO BE FIGHTING
ABOUT THIS.

22:12.640 --> 22:13.629
THIS ISN'T--
YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT--

22:13.740 --> 22:14.559
- SO LET'S STOP FIGHTING.
LISTEN--OKAY.

22:14.670 --> 22:15.739
- HOLD ON.
- NO, NO, NO.

22:15.850 --> 22:17.226
- I'M NOT FIGHTING.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

22:17.330 --> 22:18.604
- NO, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE JUDGING.

22:18.710 --> 22:20.393
YOU'RE BUSY JUDGING
WITH YOUR LITTLE COMMENTS...

22:20.510 --> 22:21.579
- NO, SHE'S NOT, CROSBY.
CROSBY!

22:21.680 --> 22:23.477
- IN A VERY SUBDUED,
CALCULATED MANNER,

22:23.580 --> 22:24.569
I WOULD SAY.
- PLEASE. ENOUGH.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.716
- IN A SUBDUED,
CALCULATED MANNER?

22:26.820 --> 22:29.300
- NO.
- SEE? EVEN SLOWER. GREAT.

22:29.410 --> 22:30.377
- JUST STOP, OKAY?

22:30.480 --> 22:31.651
LOOK, YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.921
WE SHOULD BE
MORE CONSISTENT WITH JABBAR.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.689
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO HIS BEDTIME. OKAY?

22:35.800 --> 22:36.869
- SHE'S RIGHT?

22:36.970 --> 22:39.006
- IT'S REALLY “OCT-IT A BIG DEAL.

22:39.110 --> 22:40.452
- SO CAN WE NOT MAKE IT?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.039
JUST--
- OKAY.

22:42.150 --> 22:43.139
I'M THE ONE THAT'S CRAZY.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.979
- NO, IT'S JUST...
- YEAH. NOPE.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.832
- THIS REALLY ISN'T A--
- YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.019
- IT'S NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL.
- I'M GONNA LET YOU GUYS

22:48.120 --> 22:48.734
MAKE ALL FUTURE DECISIONS.

22:48.850 --> 22:50.772
INVITE ME TO HIS GRADUATION.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.986
- CROSBY.

22:54.090 --> 22:55.500
- SO WHY DID YOU CALL
THE ADOPTION LAWYER WITHOUT ME?

22:55.610 --> 22:57.646
- I'VE ALREADY TOLD THIS TO YOU.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.672
SHE CALLED ME.
I RETURNED HER CALL.

22:59.790 --> 23:02.190
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT?

23:02.310 --> 23:03.686
WHAT WAS THE CONVERSATION?
- NOTHING.

23:03.790 --> 23:06.167
SHE--I BASICALLY SAID
THAT THE LAST TIME WE MET,

23:06.280 --> 23:10.410
YOU JUST HAD A MOMENTARY LAPSE,
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT COLD FEET.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.896
THAT'S ALL.

23:12.010 --> 23:14.592
- I JUST HAD COLD FEET.
THAT'S ALL.

23:14.700 --> 23:15.928
YEP.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.759
- YES, HONEY, IT'S--
- THAT'S JUST--

23:18.880 --> 23:20.563
CAN YOU STOP TRYING
TO SHAME ME INTO THIS?

23:20.670 --> 23:22.422
- SHAME YOU?
- YES!

23:22.530 --> 23:23.974
YOU ARE BECAUSE...
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

23:24.090 --> 23:25.318
- IT'S JUST ME.

23:25.430 --> 23:26.499
BECAUSE IT'S ME
THAT HE'S NOT BONDING WITH.

23:26.610 --> 23:27.599
- IT'S NOT JUST YOU.
- IT'S JUST ME

23:27.710 --> 23:28.745
THAT HAS
ANY KIND OF DOUBTS ABOUT IT.

23:28.850 --> 23:29.885
- I DON--
- IT'S JUST ME.

23:29.990 --> 23:31.059
IT'S ALL ME.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.149
YOU KNOW, I HAVE DOUBTS TOO.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.238
- NO, YOU DON'T!
- YES.

23:34.340 --> 23:36.479
- DON'T JUST--DON'T TRY TO MAKE
ME FEEL BE'ITER THAT WAY.

23:36.580 --> 23:37.649
THAT'S STUPID.
IT DOESN'T WORK.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.682
- OKAY.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:39.790 --> 23:41.963
I HAVE TO BE THIS WAY BECAUSE
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM

23:42.070 --> 23:43.822
FOR DOUBTS ON THIS SIDE.

23:43.930 --> 23:47.479
YOU SEEM TO BE DOUBTING
ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US.

23:47.590 --> 23:49.524
- YOU--THE--IT'S ON THAT STREET.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.518
- I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

23:51.630 --> 23:52.528
- WHO'S EATEN HERE?

23:52.630 --> 23:54.598
WHAT'S GOOD?
_ UH--

23:54.700 --> 23:56.770
- THE, UH, SHORT RIB...
- YEAH.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.256
- IS INSANE.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.600
- ARE YOU ENROLLING SYDNEY
IN KARATE?

23:59.710 --> 24:02.019
'CAUSE JABBAR WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE HER IN HIS CLASS.

24:02.130 --> 24:03.916
- IF YOU DO THAT, YOU SHOULD
HAVE VICTOR ALSO ENROLL.

24:04.020 --> 24:06.159
- YEAH.
- WOULDN'T THAT BE FUN?

24:06.270 --> 24:07.646
IF ALL THREE OF 'EM?
- [laughs]

24:07.750 --> 24:10.469
- AND AT CHRISTMAS WE COULD DO
A UFC KIND OF BRACKET.

24:10.580 --> 24:11.569
- YEAH.
- OH, GOD.

24:11.690 --> 24:12.645
NOT EVERYTHING'S
A COMPETITION, CROSBY.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.091
- TEACH 'EM KARATE.
- WELL, NO.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.302
EVERYTHING IS A COMPETITION
IN THE BRAVERMAN HOUSEHOLD.

24:15.410 --> 24:16.616
RIGHT, JULIA?

24:16.730 --> 24:18.721
WE LOVE TO COMPETE, RIGHT?

24:18.830 --> 24:19.899
JULIA?

24:20.010 --> 24:22.149
EVERYTHING'S
A COMPETITION, RIGHT?

24:22.250 --> 24:25.037
- YES, EVERYTHING IS A
COMPETITION WITH THE BRAVERMANS.

24:25.150 --> 24:28.074
YES, THAT IS TRUE.

24:28.190 --> 24:29.452
- OOH, THEY HAVE BURRATA.

24:29.570 --> 24:31.390
I'M GETTING BURRATA FOR SURE
TO KICK THINGS OFF.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.592
- MMM.
- YEAH.

24:32.710 --> 24:34.291
- OH, MY GOSH.
YOU REMEMBER WHEN I SAID,

24:34.400 --> 24:35.253
"OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET THE BURRATA."

24:35.370 --> 24:36.985
AND HER MOM SAID,
"WHAT'S BURRATA?ll

24:37.090 --> 24:38.955
I'M LIKE, "OH, IT'S JUST
REALLY TENDER...

24:39.060 --> 24:40.459
VERY SOl-T."

24:40.580 --> 24:42.161
I SAID, "WELL, IF YOU--"
- UM...

24:42.270 --> 24:46.263
CAN YOU ORDER ME
JUST--WHATEVER?

24:46.380 --> 24:47.517
- YEAH.
- PARDON ME. I'M SO SORRY.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.269
- YOU MEAN TO DRINK OR--
- AND EAT.

24:49.380 --> 24:50.688
WHATEVER.

24:50.790 --> 24:51.893
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

24:52.000 --> 24:56.346
- WHAT'S, UM--
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

24:56.460 --> 24:58.007
- UH...

24:58.110 --> 25:01.807
WE HAD A REALLY GREAT DAY.
YEAH.

25:01.910 --> 25:04.049
- [sighs]

25:08.540 --> 25:11.156
- HEY.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.636
- OH.
[cries]

25:12.750 --> 25:15.127
HI.
- BUDDY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:15.230 --> 25:17.471
YOU'RE UPSET WE'RE ORDERING
THE SHORT RIBS?

25:17.580 --> 25:19.741
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:19.860 --> 25:20.781
- I'M JUST JEALOUS.
- YOU'RE JEALOUS?

25:20.890 --> 25:22.448
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- NO.

25:22.550 --> 25:26.338
OH, GOD, CROS.

25:26.450 --> 25:29.897
UM, IT'S JUST HARD
WITH VICTOR, SO...

25:30.010 --> 25:32.274
- LIKE, WHAT,
UM, SPECIFICALLY?

25:32.390 --> 25:35.769
- LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD
ALL THIS TIME TOGETHER

25:35.870 --> 25:37.838
AND IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
WE'RE PROGRESSING, YOU KNOW?

25:37.950 --> 25:41.215
HE JUST--I'M NOT
BEING OVER-DRAMATIC.

25:41.330 --> 25:44.675
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE ME
AT--AT THIS POINT,

25:44.780 --> 25:48.432
AND IT'S SO HARD TO SEE
THAT THAT'S GONNA CHANGE.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.462
AND H DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

25:50.580 --> 25:53.026
JOEL IS FINE.
THEY'RE GREAT.

25:53.130 --> 25:54.438
THEY HAVE NO PROBLEMS.

25:54.550 --> 25:59.203
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF I DON'T SEE
SOMETHING THAT TELLS ME

25:59.310 --> 26:03.417
THAT SOME DAY, MAYBE, WE CAN
HAVE A LOVING RELATIONSHIP,

26:03.520 --> 26:06.648
THEN, YOU KNOW...

26:06.770 --> 26:08.146
THEN I SHOULDN'T BE HIS MOM,

26:08.250 --> 26:11.765
BECAUSE HE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO HAVE THAT WITH SOMEONE.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.529
- LISTEN, DO YOU WANT MY 2?

26:13.640 --> 26:14.322
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

26:14.430 --> 26:15.806
- YEAH.

26:15.910 --> 26:18.014
- WHEN JASMINE CAME
AND DROPPED JABBAR OFF,

26:18.120 --> 26:20.008
I DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE CLUE
ON HOW TO BE A PARENT.

26:20.130 --> 26:23.088
I MEAN, IT JUST HAPPENED
IN ONE SECOND,

26:23.200 --> 26:25.293
YET SHE WAS EXPECTING ME
TO BE A DAD

26:25.410 --> 26:28.470
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,
AND YOU KNOW WHO I WATCHED?

26:28.580 --> 26:31.026
WHO I STUDIED,
WHO I LOOKED UP TO?

26:31.140 --> 26:32.584
YOU.
- ME?

26:32.690 --> 26:34.066
- YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD PARENT.

26:34.170 --> 26:35.159
YOU ARE SO PATIENT.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.373
YOU'RE SO CALM,
AND YOU'RE SO INVOLVED.

26:37.490 --> 26:38.718
AND I WATCHED YOU,

26:38.830 --> 26:41.833
AND I COULD ONLY ASPIRE
TO BE AS GOOD AS YOU.

26:41.940 --> 26:43.282
AND VICTOR HATES YOU.
OKAY.

26:43.390 --> 26:45.597
YOU KNOW WHO I HATED
WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD?

26:45.700 --> 26:47.008
MOM.
- [laughs]

26:47.120 --> 26:49.281
- REMEMBER, SHE WAS
ON HER CRAZY HEALTH FOOD KICK

26:49.400 --> 26:51.493
AND ONLY PUT WHEAT GERM COOKIES
IN OUR LUNCH BOX?

26:51.610 --> 26:52.634
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

26:52.740 --> 26:53.707
SHE WAS DEPLORABLE,
AND I HATED HER.

26:53.810 --> 26:56.916
I LOVED HER,
BUT I ALSO HATED HER.

26:57.020 --> 26:58.260
BUT I DIDN'T TELL HER
THAT I LOVED HER.

26:58.370 --> 27:00.986
I ONLY SAID I HATED HER.

27:01.100 --> 27:03.568
AND THAT LI'ITLE GUY NEEDS YOU.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.442
AND HE LOVES YOU,
AND I KNOW HE LOVES YOU

27:05.550 --> 27:07.893
BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
NOT TO LOVE YOU.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.581
FOR REAL.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.442
LISTEN TO ME, JULES.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.619
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO TO ME?

27:22.640 --> 27:24.733
- HEY.
- HEY.

27:24.850 --> 27:25.976
AREN'T YOU GONNA BE LATE?

27:26.090 --> 27:28.467
- NO.
MY MOM TOOK JABBAR.

27:28.570 --> 27:31.016
- OH.

27:31.130 --> 27:34.850
- I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH HER.

27:34.960 --> 27:35.858
I FEEL REALLY BAD.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.473
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

27:37.580 --> 27:41.368
BUT I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.300
- APPRECIATE WHAT?

27:43.420 --> 27:45.650
- THAT WAS AN APOLOGY, RIGHT?
- NO, IT WASN'T.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.829
WHY WOULD I BE APOLOGIZING?

27:46.940 --> 27:48.862
- WHY WOULD YOU--
[laughs]

27:48.970 --> 27:51.006
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

27:51.110 --> 27:52.008
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'D APOLOGIZE

27:52.110 --> 27:53.213
BECAUSE WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO GO IN

27:53.320 --> 27:55.663
AS A UNIFIED FRONT
AND CONFRONT YOUR MOTHER

27:55.770 --> 27:56.668
AND THEN RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

27:56.770 --> 27:57.976
YOU JUST PULLED THE RIPCORD

27:58.090 --> 27:58.567
AND THE CHUTE DEPLOYED
AND YOU WERE GONE.

27:58.670 --> 28:01.389
- YEAH, BUT--

28:01.500 --> 28:03.536
- I THINK MAYBE I WOULD DESERVE
AN APOLOGY BECAUSE OF THAT.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.699
- NO, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
GONNA COME AT HER LIKE THAT.

28:05.820 --> 28:06.844
- I DIDN'T COME AT HER.

28:06.960 --> 28:07.915
- YES, YOU DID.
YOU CONFRONTED HER.

28:08.030 --> 28:09.713
- WE HAD A CONVERSATION,

28:09.820 --> 28:10.957
AND THEN I LOOK OVER AND
MY PARTNER IS TAKING A NAP,

28:11.060 --> 28:13.949
OR EVEN WORSE,
JOINED HER SIDE.

28:14.070 --> 28:16.618
- I DIDN'T JOIN HER SIDE, OKAY?
- OH, REALLY? OKAY.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.278
- LOOK, JUST APOLOGIZE.

28:18.380 --> 28:19.483
IT'LL MAKE IT ALL RIGHT.
- NO, I CAN'T.

28:19.590 --> 28:22.650
- YES.
- I'M NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE.

28:22.770 --> 28:24.658
- JUST BE THE BIGGER MAN
AND APOLOGIZE.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.829
- I CAN'T--
- OKAY? PLEASE?

28:26.940 --> 28:28.487
- SWEETIE, I'M--
I CANNOT DO THAT.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.568
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

28:30.670 --> 28:32.217
WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN
IS YOU HAVE TO LEARN

28:32.330 --> 28:33.251
TO CONFRONT YOUR MOTHER.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.566
THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.
- WHAT?

28:34.670 --> 28:36.080
- THAT IS NOT--THAT'S--
- THAT'S--

28:36.190 --> 28:37.088
THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

28:37.190 --> 28:39.249
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU DID?

28:39.370 --> 28:40.951
EH?

28:41.060 --> 28:41.674
THAT'S THE--OH, THAT'S CRAZY?

28:41.780 --> 28:43.953
THAT'S CRAZY TALK?

28:44.060 --> 28:46.506
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU CONFRONTED YOUR MOM?

28:51.660 --> 28:53.275
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT SIDE
OF THIS ARGUMENT.

29:06.810 --> 29:10.109
- HI.
- HI.

29:10.230 --> 29:10.662
- HI.
- HI.

29:10.780 --> 29:13.635
- HOW ARE YOU?

29:13.750 --> 29:14.535
- I'M GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

29:14.640 --> 29:16.642
- I'M GOOD.
- COME IN.

29:16.750 --> 29:18.263
- OH.
- MY PLACE IS WRECKED 'CAUSE--

29:18.370 --> 29:20.099
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
THAT'S OKAY.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.781
WE COULD, UH--WE COULD
JUST TALK ABOUT IT OUT HERE.

29:21.890 --> 29:22.857
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.063
- YOU LOOK GREAT.

29:24.170 --> 29:26.479
- THANKS.
- BEAUTIFUL.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.273
- UM...
- AND WHY'D YOU SWING BY?

29:28.380 --> 29:31.065
IT'S A SURPRISE.
- [giggles] RIGHT. YES.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.239
BECAUSE I JUST WANTED TO...
CHECK UP ON YOU.

29:33.350 --> 29:34.999
- OH.
- SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.

29:35.110 --> 29:36.145
SAY HI.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.319
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
HANGING OUT WITH ZEEK.

29:37.430 --> 29:40.183
THAT'S PROBABLY FUN.
HAVING SOME PLAYDATES.

29:40.290 --> 29:42.565
- HE'S A GOOD HANG.
- YEAH, HE'S A GREAT HANG.

29:42.670 --> 29:44.638
THAT'S COOL.
HE TOLD ME YOU, UM,

29:44.740 --> 29:45.980
TALKED TO JOEL.

29:46.090 --> 29:47.182
YOU WENT BACK
AND APOLOGIZED.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.325
AND I JUST THOUGHT
THAT WAS, LIKE, VERY--

29:49.440 --> 29:50.190
- NO, I-I WENT BACK.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.951
I WASN'T TRYING
TO WORK MY WAY--

29:53.060 --> 29:54.470
- I KNOW.
- NO, REALLY.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.195
- NO, I-I GET IT.
- OKAY.

29:56.310 --> 29:56.878
- I GET IT, I WAS JUST
ACTUALLY GONNA SAY

29:57.000 --> 29:58.513
THAT I WAS PROUD OF YOU.

29:58.620 --> 30:01.544
- YEAH, I WENT BACK
AND ASKED HIM FOR MY JOB BACK.

30:01.660 --> 30:02.922
- WOW.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.439
- IT DIDN'T--
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

30:04.560 --> 30:08.519
- [clicks tongue] SOUNDS LIKE
THE ATTITUDE OF A QUI'I'I'ER.

30:08.630 --> 30:11.178
- ME?
- YEAH!

30:11.290 --> 30:13.281
IF YOU WANT THE JOB,
YOU SHOULD GO BACK THERE.

30:13.390 --> 30:14.209
AND, I MEAN, DID YOU
PASSIONATELY TELL HIM--

30:14.320 --> 30:17.187
- YES! I MEAN,
I DIDN'T, LIKE...

30:17.290 --> 30:19.941
GET ON MY KNEES AND KISS
HIS HAND OR ANY--

30:20.050 --> 30:21.938
- I'M JUST SAYING, I THINK
IF YOU WANTED THE JOB,

30:22.060 --> 30:24.085
YOU COULD GET IT BACK.
- I MADE IT VERY CLEAR.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.259
- MM, TAKE IT FROM SOMEBODY
WHO HAS EXPERIENCE

30:26.370 --> 30:28.053
BRIBING JOEL.

30:28.170 --> 30:29.785
IT'S--IT'S DOABLE.
YOU JUST GO'ITA GET

30:29.890 --> 30:31.755
A VERY HONEST LOOK
ON YOUR FACE

30:31.860 --> 30:33.339
AND BRING SOME TREATS.

30:33.450 --> 30:35.099
I THINK IT COULD WORK
AND, YOU KNOW,

30:35.210 --> 30:37.542
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

30:40.800 --> 30:43.485
- IT'S SO COLD.
DO YOU WANNA--

30:43.600 --> 30:45.556
- I CAN'T.
- OKAY.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.422
- WELL, I...

30:50.530 --> 30:51.394
I SHOULD GO.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.298
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.699
- YOU TOO.

30:57.820 --> 30:59.879
WELL...

30:59.990 --> 31:03.198
SEE YOU SOON.

31:03.300 --> 31:04.369
- I HOPE SO.

31:11.830 --> 31:15.584
BYE.

31:17.390 --> 31:18.482
- CAN I WEAR SLIPPERS
TO SCHOOL?

31:18.600 --> 31:21.660
- NO, YOU CAN'T WEAR
YOUR SLIPPERS TO SCHOOL.

31:21.770 --> 31:22.839
- WELL, THEY'RE WARM.

31:22.950 --> 31:24.906
- WELL, THEY'RE SLIPPERS.

31:25.020 --> 31:26.703
[chuckles]

31:26.810 --> 31:28.425
WEAR YOUR SLIPPERS TO SCHOOL.
- REALLY?

31:28.540 --> 31:29.393
- YES.
- YAY!

31:29.500 --> 31:30.808
- CAN I WEAR MY SLIPPERS
TO SCHOOL?

31:30.920 --> 31:32.740
- DO YOU WANT TO WEAR
YOUR SLIPPERS TO SCHOOL?

31:32.850 --> 31:34.192
- NO.
- GOOD.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.153
HEY, VICTOR.

31:35.270 --> 31:36.407
- YES?

31:36.510 --> 31:38.262
- UM, COME HERE.

31:38.370 --> 31:39.780
- I ALREADY DID MY HOMEWORK.
IT'S FINE.

31:39.890 --> 31:41.755
- GOOD. UM...

31:41.860 --> 31:43.339
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, THOUGH.

31:47.070 --> 31:50.130
JOEL--YOUR DAD--AND I

31:50.250 --> 31:51.000
ARE GOING TO CHOOSE
A DATE NEXT WEEK

31:51.110 --> 31:56.525
TO FINALIZE YOUR ADOPTION.

31:56.630 --> 31:57.767
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

31:57.880 --> 31:59.393
- NOT REALLY.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.013
- OKAY...

32:01.120 --> 32:02.872
UH...THAT MEANS WE'RE
GONNA GO TO COURT,

32:02.990 --> 32:04.560
ALL OF US TOGETHER.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.568
AND WE'RE GONNA STAND
IN FRONT OF A JUDGE,

32:06.680 --> 32:08.295
AND WE WILL PROMISE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.504
AND WE'LL PROBABLY SIGN
SOME PAPERS

32:10.610 --> 32:15.309
AND THEN WE WILL BE
YOUR MOM AND DAD...

32:15.410 --> 32:16.445
FROM NOW ON.

32:20.280 --> 32:21.793
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD TO YOU?

32:21.900 --> 32:25.028
- SURE.

32:25.150 --> 32:26.583
I'M GONNA GO GET
MY BACKPACK.

32:26.700 --> 32:29.077
- OKAY.

32:32.950 --> 32:37.535
- YOU SURE?

32:37.640 --> 32:38.083
- NOPE. HEH.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.363
BUT YOU KNOW...

32:45.230 --> 32:47.949
[both giggling]

32:48.060 --> 32:49.857
- SO NEXT TUESDAY,
THERE WILL BE

32:49.960 --> 32:50.881
A PARENT EDUCATION SEMINAR

32:51.000 --> 32:53.207
ON NEW APPROACHES
TO LEARNING MATH,

32:53.310 --> 32:55.346
LED BY DR. ARROYO,
AND ANYONE INTERESTED

32:55.450 --> 32:59.170
CAN SHOW UP AT 6:00,
NO NEED TO RSVP.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.349
NOW, OUR FINAL ORDER
OF BUSINESS

33:00.460 --> 33:03.384
IS A PROPOSAL
BY KRISTINA BRAVERMAN

33:03.490 --> 33:06.664
THAT WE BRING BACK
THE VENDING MACHINE

33:06.770 --> 33:07.384
THAT WAS HERE LAST YEAR.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.149
- I'M CONFUSED.

33:09.260 --> 33:10.158
THAT MATTER'S SE'ITLED.

33:10.260 --> 33:11.841
WE VOTED ON IT LAST YEAR.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.258
- I AGREE.

33:13.370 --> 33:14.257
- SO WHY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT IT AGAIN?

33:14.370 --> 33:17.191
- I AM NOT SURE.
- SORRY, GUYS.

33:17.300 --> 33:19.052
I JUST--I DON'T GET
TO MANY OF THESE MEETINGS,

33:19.160 --> 33:21.674
BUT IT THOUGHT THAT--
CAN I JUST TALK OUT LOUD?

33:21.790 --> 33:22.302
- YEAH.
COME ON UP, KRISTINA.

33:22.410 --> 33:25.231
- I'M--OKAY.

33:25.340 --> 33:27.581
[sighs] I HAVE--
I JUST WROTE SOME NOTES

33:27.690 --> 33:29.100
THAT MAYBE I COULD JUST
SHARE WITH YOU GUYS,

33:29.210 --> 33:30.962
JUST TO GIVE YOU A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING.

33:31.070 --> 33:32.059
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THE REASONS

33:32.180 --> 33:33.033
WHY YOU WANT THEM
OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.459
OKAY? I GET THAT.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.688
- SO WHY ARE WE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION?

33:37.800 --> 33:40.872
- WELL, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.

33:40.980 --> 33:42.186
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I FOUND OUT

33:42.290 --> 33:44.394
THAT THE EXTRA MONEY
FROM THE VENDING MACHINES

33:44.500 --> 33:46.354
WENT TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS
LIKE ART AND MUSIC

33:46.470 --> 33:49.871
AND HELPED FUND THE P.E.
RIGHT?

33:49.990 --> 33:50.979
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

33:51.090 --> 33:53.263
- AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT.
OKAY?

33:53.370 --> 33:55.019
LAST YEAR ALONE,
WE BROUGHT IN...

33:55.130 --> 33:58.258
$12,400, IT GENERATED.
- OKAY.

33:58.380 --> 33:59.449
- SO THERE'S A GAPING HOLE
IN THE BUDGET.

33:59.550 --> 34:01.609
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT
A MISSING ART CLASS.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.654
BUT I DON'T SEE WHY
MY DAUGHTER'S ALLOWANCE

34:03.760 --> 34:06.581
SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR TAKING CARE OF THAT.

34:06.690 --> 34:09.102
- OKAY, I UNDERSTAND ALL
OF THAT, BUT HERE'S THE THING.

34:09.210 --> 34:11.622
YOUR DAUGHTER'S ALLOWANCE
MAY BE GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE.

34:11.730 --> 34:14.733
AT LEAST WE HAVE
SOME CONTROL IN THE SCHOOL.

34:14.840 --> 34:18.185
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT
OUR KIDS ARE BUYING JUNK FOOD.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.734
AND THEY'RE BUYING
MORE JUNK FOOD

34:19.850 --> 34:21.465
FROM CONVENIENCE STORES
BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THERE.

34:21.570 --> 34:23.743
AND OUR SCHOOL
IS LOSING FUNDS

34:23.850 --> 34:25.738
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
THAT VENDING MACHINE.

34:25.850 --> 34:28.159
SO WE REALLY HAVEN'T SOLVED
THE PROBLEM, YOU GUYS.

34:28.270 --> 34:29.339
WE'VE JUST SORT OF,
LIKE, MOVED IT.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.190
- YEP.

34:30.300 --> 34:31.642
- AND THAT'S NOT HELPING
ANYBODY.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.479
SO THIS IS WHAT I PROPOSE.

34:33.580 --> 34:36.299
I PROPOSE THAT WE BRING BACK
THE VENDING MACHINES,

34:36.410 --> 34:38.514
AND WE OFFER THE KIDS
HEALTHY CHOICES.

34:38.620 --> 34:41.930
WE FILL THOSE VENDING MACHINES
WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

34:42.040 --> 34:45.168
AND LOW-SUGAR CHOICES
AND HEALTHY FOODS.

34:45.290 --> 34:46.598
- DO THEY HAVE THOSE?
- OH, GOD, YEAH.

34:46.700 --> 34:48.247
THE HAVE THOSE.
OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE THOSE.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.567
I'VE LOOKED INTO IT.
- DO THEY CARRY DIET PEPSI?

34:50.670 --> 34:52.149
- [scoffs]

34:52.260 --> 34:53.591
- BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE HONEST,
AI-TER FIl-TH PERIOD,

34:53.710 --> 34:55.598
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR A COLD DIET PEPSI.

34:55.710 --> 34:58.565
- DON'T KNOW,
BUT I WILL LOOK INTO IT.

35:06.240 --> 35:06.990
[keys jangling]

35:07.100 --> 35:08.954
- HANK.

35:09.070 --> 35:11.061
HEY.

35:11.170 --> 35:12.034
- HEY.

35:12.140 --> 35:13.994
YEAH, SHE'S, UH...

35:14.110 --> 35:15.202
SHE'S NOT IN RIGHT NOW.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.311
- OH, H CAME
TO TALK TO YOU, ACTUALLY.

35:17.420 --> 35:18.102
- OH.
- YEAH.

35:18.210 --> 35:20.178
- ALL RIGHT.

35:20.290 --> 35:21.769
YOU WANNA--
YOU WANNA GO INSIDE?

35:21.870 --> 35:22.279
- OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

35:22.390 --> 35:26.349
UM, I JUST, UH...

35:26.460 --> 35:28.769
YOU KNOW, THE MORE
I THINK ABOUT...

35:28.880 --> 35:30.768
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
WITH ME AND SARAH,

35:30.880 --> 35:32.916
THE MORE I REALIZE THAT...

35:33.020 --> 35:35.773
WHAT YOU DID WAS--
WAS CALCULATED

35:35.890 --> 35:38.404
AND MANIPULATIVE
AND COWARDLY--

35:38.510 --> 35:40.239
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I DON'T KNOW--

35:40.340 --> 35:41.193
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:41.310 --> 35:43.619
- WELL, YOU--
YOU KISSED HER.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.166
YOU KISSED HER WHEN YOU KNEW
THAT WE WERE ENGAGED.

35:46.280 --> 35:48.419
ARE YOU GONNA DENY THAT?

35:48.520 --> 35:50.169
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK--
- OKAY, SO NO.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.349
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DENY IT,
SO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY

35:51.450 --> 35:54.385
TO KISS ANOTHER MAN'S FIANCEE?

35:54.490 --> 35:55.559
- LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

35:55.670 --> 35:57.809
I DON'T CALCULATE
TO KISS ANYBODY. OKAY?

35:57.910 --> 36:00.834
SO JUST RELAX AND MAYBE
WALK AROUND THE BLOCK ONCE--

36:00.950 --> 36:02.520
- I DON'T NEED TO TAKE A WALK
AROUND THE BLOCK.

36:02.640 --> 36:03.390
I-I'M FINE.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.535
I JUST CAME HERE TO TELL YOU

36:04.640 --> 36:05.629
THAT I AM STILL IN LOVE
WITH SARAH,

36:05.740 --> 36:07.742
AND I'M GOING TO BE
THE CLASSY GUY

36:07.850 --> 36:10.535
THAT YOU NEVER WERE
AND TELL YOU TO YOUR FACE

36:10.650 --> 36:14.643
THAT I'M PLANNING
ON TAKING HER BACK.

36:31.870 --> 36:35.454
- COULD BE 8 AND 4
INSTEAD OF ONLY 4 AND 9.

36:35.570 --> 36:37.424
CLIP IT.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.633
- OH, NO, THERE HE IS.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.844
THE GUY THAT COST US ALL A GRAND
IN A SINGLE DAY.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.087
- THAT'S ME.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.679
- YOU COST ME A GRAND
EVERY DAY.

36:44.780 --> 36:47.192
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I'M JUST LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.267
HE'S DANGEROUS.
- WOULD YOU GO

36:48.370 --> 36:49.576
MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL
OR SOMETHING?

36:49.690 --> 36:51.829
SORRY.
- UH, LISTEN, I REALLY

36:51.930 --> 36:54.342
STRUCK THE WRONG NOTE
WITH YOU LAST TIME.

36:54.450 --> 36:55.929
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- OH, YOU WERE FINE.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.553
- NO, I, UM...

36:57.660 --> 36:59.514
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR MY JOB BACK.

36:59.630 --> 37:01.689
I JUST DIDN'T WANT THINGS
TO BE WEIRD HERE.

37:01.800 --> 37:02.380
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

37:02.490 --> 37:04.481
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT WEIRD.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.249
IT'S BALLSY OF YOU
TO COME BACK.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.181
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

37:09.290 --> 37:12.566
- DONUTS.

37:12.670 --> 37:14.228
- DID AMBER TELL YOU
I LIKE DONUTS?

37:14.330 --> 37:16.298
- I HAVE A SOURCE.
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHO IT IS.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.469
- YEAH. OH, MAN.

37:17.580 --> 37:19.673
YOU NAILED IT.
THANK YOU.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.816
- THANK YOU. UM...

37:21.920 --> 37:24.957
YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD GUY,
AND--AND I'M SO GLAD

37:25.070 --> 37:26.230
THAT YOU HIRED ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND THEN...

37:26.340 --> 37:29.821

37:29.930 --> 37:31.238
NO HARD FEELINGS.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.829

37:40.630 --> 37:43.042
YOU GOT GLOVES IN YOUR CAR?

37:43.150 --> 37:44.117
- YES, SIR.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.562
- THEN GO GET 'EM.

37:45.670 --> 37:46.591
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU HOW TO
SWEAT SOME PIPE.

37:46.710 --> 37:47.802
- REALLY? OHH!

37:47.920 --> 37:49.080
- THANK YOU SO MUCH!

37:49.190 --> 37:50.748
OKAY, I'LL BE--
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

37:50.850 --> 37:52.704
- YEAH.

37:52.820 --> 37:54.333
- THAT'S JUST
A "YABBA-DABBA-DOO"

37:54.440 --> 37:55.475
THAT YOU'VE ADDED A "G" TO.

37:55.580 --> 37:57.161
- SCRABBA-DABBA-DO!

37:57.270 --> 37:57.850
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT ORIGINAL.

37:57.960 --> 37:58.437
THAT'S STOLEN.

37:58.550 --> 38:00.506
- SCRABBA-DABBA-DO!

38:00.620 --> 38:02.372
- YOU STOLE THAT
FROM FRED FLINTSTONE.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.061
HE'S LIKE, "OOH!"

38:04.170 --> 38:05.159
- GOT YOUR PLATE
READY FOR YOU.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.998
- THANK YOU.
BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND,

38:07.110 --> 38:08.134
I'M JUST GOING TO EAT MY DINNER
IN MY ROOM.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.411
- WAIT. WHY?

38:10.520 --> 38:13.455
- YOU KNOW, IT, UH,
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

38:13.560 --> 38:14.868
IT MIGHT BE BE'ITER FOR ME
TO NOT INTERFERE WITH THINGS.

38:14.980 --> 38:17.426
- MOM, YOU'RE NOT INTERFERING
WITH ANYTHING.

38:17.530 --> 38:19.145
PLEASE JUST SIT DOWN
AND EAT WITH US, PLEASE?

38:19.260 --> 38:20.329
- I'M GONNA HAVE MY DINNER
IN MY ROOM.

38:20.430 --> 38:21.704
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
EAT WITH US, GRANDMA?

38:21.810 --> 38:25.257
- NO, BUT I AM GOING
TO COME IN

38:25.370 --> 38:27.509
AND SAY GOOD NIGHT

38:27.610 --> 38:28.531
OKAY?

38:28.650 --> 38:32.029
- OKAY.

38:32.130 --> 38:35.236

[door shuts]

38:43.210 --> 38:44.791
- HI.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.549
- I GOT THE DONUTS,
EVEN THOUGH YOU TOLD ME--

38:46.660 --> 38:50.426
- GOOD!
LISTEN, I SAW MARK.

38:50.530 --> 38:51.451
- OKAY.

38:51.570 --> 38:54.209
I, UH--

38:55.880 --> 38:58.110
YOU KNOW, I--

38:58.230 --> 38:59.492
- YEAH, YEAH.

38:59.610 --> 39:01.054
- HE'D BEEN OUT THERE
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.570
BUT, UH...

39:02.680 --> 39:04.409
HE TOLD ME HE WANTED
TO WIN YOU BACK.

39:04.510 --> 39:07.229
[forced chuckle]

39:07.340 --> 39:08.329
YEAH.
- OKAY.

39:08.440 --> 39:12.308
- SO I DON'T KNOW.

39:12.410 --> 39:13.581
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

39:13.690 --> 39:14.725
I'M JUST TELLING YOU.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.104
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

39:16.210 --> 39:18.690
HE, UH, BASICALLY...

39:18.800 --> 39:21.246
CHALLENGED ME TO A DUEL
MAYBE OR SOMETHING, WHICH--

39:21.350 --> 39:22.385
- I'M SORRY, I DID--
I HAD NO, UH--

39:22.490 --> 39:24.765
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

39:24.870 --> 39:26.189
- YEAH, YOU HAD THE COFFEE
WITH HIM, AND THEN...

39:26.290 --> 39:27.564
- OH, MY GOD.
- HE CAME OVER.

39:27.670 --> 39:29.319
- NO, I'M JUST SAYING.

39:29.430 --> 39:31.603
- I DIDN'T, UH,
DO ANYTHING MAGICAL

39:31.710 --> 39:34.508
IN OUR COFFEE THAT WOULD
MAKE HIM SAY THAT.

39:34.610 --> 39:35.634
- YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE KISS.

39:35.750 --> 39:36.774
WHY DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT THE KISS?

39:36.890 --> 39:37.879
- I--[stammering]

39:37.990 --> 39:39.605
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

39:39.720 --> 39:42.371
- I'M JUST ASKING WHY WOULD YOU
TELL HIM SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

39:42.480 --> 39:43.754
- NO, YOU'RE NOT JUST ASKING,
YOU'RE--

39:43.860 --> 39:45.475
WHY WOULD I TELL HIM
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

39:45.590 --> 39:46.682
BECAUSE, AT THE TIME,
WE WERE ENGAGED.

39:46.790 --> 39:48.929
AND HE ASKED IF I EVER
CHEATED ON HIM WITH YOU,

39:49.040 --> 39:51.725
AND I DIDN'T,
SO I WANTED TO TELL HIM

39:51.830 --> 39:53.479
THE ONE THING
THAT DID HAPPEN.

39:53.590 --> 39:55.797
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
THAT'S UPSETTING TO YOU.

39:55.910 --> 39:57.172
- IT'S UPSE'ITING.
I DON'T WANT THIS.

39:57.290 --> 39:59.429
I DON'T WANT THIS.

39:59.530 --> 40:00.804
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE JEALOUS GUY.

40:00.910 --> 40:02.559
I DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED
IN THIS DRAMA.

40:02.670 --> 40:04.399
I DIDN'T WANT THIS.
I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.353
- OKAY, WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HAVE IT.

40:05.470 --> 40:08.462
- NO, BUT--BUT--BUT--
LI--BUT--

40:08.570 --> 40:10.367
IT HAPPENED.
I DIDN'T CALCULATE IT.

40:10.470 --> 40:12.028
I DIDN'T MANIPULATE IT.
IT HAPPENED.

40:12.130 --> 40:13.711
- WELL, NO ONE WAS ACCUSING--
- AND I LIKE IT, I LIKE IT!

40:13.820 --> 40:15.435
- OH, YOU DO LIKE IT?
- YEAH, YES!

40:15.550 --> 40:17.370
- OKAY, THANKS. I DIDN'T KNOW.
I WASN'T SURE.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.926
- BUT I DON'T LIKE...

40:20.030 --> 40:21.509
I DON'T LIKE WHERE
IT'S GONNA END UP.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.848
- HOW--WHERE IS IT
GONNA END UP?

40:22.970 --> 40:24.232
- BECAUSE I CAN SEE,
I CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

40:24.350 --> 40:25.339
I KNOW...

40:25.450 --> 40:27.315
I'M SCREWED, I JUST--
- WHY?

40:27.420 --> 40:28.489
- BECAUSE.
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

40:28.590 --> 40:31.150
- BECAUSE I'M INTO THIS.

40:31.250 --> 40:33.810
- OKAY. I...

40:33.910 --> 40:36.879
NEVER HEARD THAT
FROM YOU BEFORE.

40:40.290 --> 40:41.222
AND--WHERE YOU GOING NOW?

40:41.330 --> 40:43.366
- I GO'ITA GO.
I GO'ITA GO.

40:43.470 --> 40:44.744
I GO'ITA THINK THIS--
I GOTTA--

40:44.850 --> 40:45.885
- DON'T GO!
- LISTEN.

40:45.990 --> 40:47.434
- "I'M INTO THIS,"
AND WALK AWAY?

40:47.540 --> 40:49.849
THAT'S--
YOU CAN'T DO BOTH.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.440
- YOU GOTTA FIGURE IT OUT.
- WHY DO I HAVE TO FIGURE--

40:52.550 --> 40:54.165
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, BUT--

40:54.270 --> 40:55.339
- WHAT DO I HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT?

40:55.450 --> 40:56.474
- YOU GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU WANT!

40:56.590 --> 40:57.750
- AM I NOT HERE
DOING THIS WITH YOU?

40:57.860 --> 41:00.579
WHY ARE YOU WALKING
AWAY FROM ME? PLEASE!

41:00.690 --> 41:02.658
- I KNOW WHAT I WANT.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS.

41:02.770 --> 41:05.216
YOU GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU WANT.

41:13.540 --> 41:17.362
[background chatter]

41:17.470 --> 41:19.529
- MAX! MAX!

41:19.640 --> 41:21.574

41:21.680 --> 41:22.886
YOU'VE GO'ITA SEE THIS.

41:22.990 --> 41:24.400

TO RETURN TO THE LIBRARY.

41:24.510 --> 41:25.499
- MAX, IT'S BACK.
- WHAT IS?

41:25.620 --> 41:27.372
- THE VENDING MACHINE.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.266
IT'S OUTSIDE, MAX.

41:29.380 --> 41:32.611
- I WANNA REST IN PEACE,
I WANNA DANCE IN JOY

41:32.730 --> 41:34.243
- NO RUNNING!
- MOVE!

41:34.350 --> 41:36.170
- I WANNA DANCE IN THE
GRAVEYARDS, THE GRAVEYARDS

41:36.280 --> 41:38.726
AND WHEN I'M ALIVE,
I DON'T WANNA BE ALONE

41:38.840 --> 41:40.239
MOURNING THE ONES

41:40.350 --> 41:42.625
- YES!

41:42.740 --> 41:44.116
[cheers and applause]
YES!

41:44.220 --> 41:45.596
OH, MY GOD, I DID IT.

41:45.710 --> 41:47.905
I DID--I REALLY--
I GOT--

41:48.020 --> 41:50.250
YES! YES!

41:50.360 --> 41:51.566
YES!

41:51.680 --> 41:55.298
- I WANNA LIVE

41:55.400 --> 41:57.675
AND WE WILL WALK BEYOND

41:57.790 --> 41:58.745
OUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS

41:58.860 --> 42:02.921
THEY WILL CARRY ON

42:03.030 --> 42:03.758
LIKE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG

42:03.860 --> 42:07.614
WE WILL STAND BESIDE

42:07.730 --> 42:15.034
AND BREATHE IN THEIR
NEW LIFE
