PAOLO GIORDANO:
It's almost like a dream.

1:00:51.583 --> 1:00:55.125
It's an escape, but it's also--
It's almost like a dream.

1:00:55.333 --> 1:00:58.959
And I think that when you tell
stories about

1:00:59.709 --> 1:01:03.834
that particular age,
you have to remember

1:01:03.917 --> 1:01:08.542
that you need to dream
and leave space for dreams

1:01:08.625 --> 1:01:10.500
and visions and just this...

1:01:11.667 --> 1:01:14.917
urgency to escape
everything sometimes.

1:01:23.959 --> 1:01:25.458
(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

1:01:27.625 --> 1:01:30.750
I think that Caitlin learns
the very harsh lesson

1:01:30.834 --> 1:01:34.000
that the identity is
constantly shifting.

1:01:35.333 --> 1:01:38.375
I think she understands
in that moment,

1:01:38.458 --> 1:01:42.542
with great sorrow,
that she probably

1:01:42.959 --> 1:01:46.041
doesn't want to be what
she thought she wanted to be.

1:01:46.625 --> 1:01:51.834
But in this sense of defeat
that she feels,

1:01:52.166 --> 1:01:55.041
she also finds something
revelatory,

1:01:55.750 --> 1:01:59.250
something painfully beautiful.

1:02:00.166 --> 1:02:05.333
And that's what is the trigger
of her confusion, rage,

1:02:05.834 --> 1:02:08.333
sadness in the bathroom.

1:02:09.041 --> 1:02:12.500
In practice, she's understanding

1:02:12.667 --> 1:02:15.667
the real need of utopia
for the self.

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:18.458
To be recognized in the gaze
of the other.

1:02:19.709 --> 1:02:22.542
Both Caitlin and Fraser,
and their friends,

1:02:22.625 --> 1:02:25.667
they belong to
a generation who...

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:29.542
often just sails through

1:02:29.792 --> 1:02:33.750
this possible definitions
and doesn't really stop

1:02:34.083 --> 1:02:37.208

the right definition is.

1:02:37.667 --> 1:02:39.709
(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

1:03:04.083 --> 1:03:08.000
And finally, Fraser surrenders
to Italy.

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.709
Only to find that something
that elevates him

1:03:14.083 --> 1:03:17.125
in the thing that--
in the person that has been

1:03:17.208 --> 1:03:20.250
most close to him for so long
is Caitlin.

1:03:23.917 --> 1:03:26.500
She's been going through so much
throughout the entire season,

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:29.667
and finally coming-- it's all
finally coming to a head,

1:03:29.750 --> 1:03:31.792
where's she's finally,
like, realizing, like,

1:03:31.875 --> 1:03:34.166
who she wants to be,
and what she wants to be,

1:03:34.250 --> 1:03:37.417
and where she stands
with Fraser.

1:03:38.083 --> 1:03:40.000
They belong in their own worlds.

1:03:40.083 --> 1:03:43.208
And Fraser has found
the perfect person who belongs

1:03:43.291 --> 1:03:44.709
in his world as well,
and that's Caitlin.

1:03:44.792 --> 1:03:49.458
And she is in her own world,
like, lost in life,

1:03:49.917 --> 1:03:53.500

each other's savior, I think.
