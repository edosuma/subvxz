00:19.529 --> 00:22.279
(dramatic music)

00:31.965 --> 00:33.190
- [James Voiceover] But,
yes, this is the voicemail

00:33.190 --> 00:34.890
you said no one has ever left you.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.110
Three minutes of everything about someone

00:38.110 --> 00:39.023
you've just met.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.043
Enough to know whether
or not it's worth it.

00:45.043 --> 00:45.960
Tara Reata.

00:47.045 --> 00:49.712
(camera clicks)

00:52.280 --> 00:53.990
You know that's about
the most beautiful name

00:53.990 --> 00:57.963
I've ever heard, even if it is fake.

00:58.897 --> 01:00.230
You're absolved.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.250
Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind meets

01:03.250 --> 01:05.113
Liz Taylor in Giant, right.

01:06.220 --> 01:10.343
Two great ranchers, Tara and Reata.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.280
Maybe you're more of a
fantasist than I realised.

01:17.170 --> 01:20.123
So let a few dates in.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.853
I need you to know exactly
where we are with that.

01:24.760 --> 01:29.030
Tom, he's worked in my
office for three years.

01:29.030 --> 01:31.580
But I honestly had no idea
he was in love with you.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.213
I have an insipid trophy wife, Lisa.

01:38.310 --> 01:41.319
We married on a whim
when she saw the money.

01:41.319 --> 01:43.750
(camera clicks)

01:43.750 --> 01:45.958
Biggest mistake of my life.

01:45.958 --> 01:48.125
I know I'm not 24 anymore, but

01:48.125 --> 01:50.920
she's got claws so far in my back,

01:50.920 --> 01:53.563
I'm surprised I haven't
actually bled to death.

01:54.870 --> 01:58.210
Only she can tell you if
we're together or separated,

01:58.210 --> 02:01.820
which is why I've called you now,

02:01.820 --> 02:03.470
which is why I'm telling you now.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.750
I'm ready for divorce.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.276
I know it's gonna cost me,

02:08.276 --> 02:11.153
but I think my sanity
is a small price to pay.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.270
We have a daughter, Charlotte,

02:15.270 --> 02:16.483
who I barely see.

02:17.350 --> 02:19.630
She might be part of my
equation in the future.

02:19.630 --> 02:20.803
I don't know.

02:22.080 --> 02:25.710
We have a nanny slash hired mother,

02:25.710 --> 02:28.842
who does her best to side with Lisa,

02:28.842 --> 02:33.773
and she has sisters who come
and go with conflicting advice.

02:34.790 --> 02:38.103
Vicky, her eldest sister, is
potentially more compassionate.

02:38.103 --> 02:40.770
(camera clicks)

02:42.600 --> 02:45.080
Jan is the more troubled of the two.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.950
But I'll give you my horrible confession

02:46.950 --> 02:49.603
because I can only be honest now.

02:50.929 --> 02:53.596
(camera clicks)

02:55.120 --> 02:57.503
I met Jan first.

02:59.460 --> 03:02.533
She introduced me to her sister, Lisa.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.038
And as a man with no soul left,

03:07.038 --> 03:10.083
I chose vanity.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.720
But Jan has too much dignity

03:13.720 --> 03:15.903
to ever raise this as an issue.

03:18.874 --> 03:22.924
And our mutual friend is Tom.

03:22.924 --> 03:25.591
(camera clicks)

03:27.240 --> 03:29.860
My wife was the girl who ruined his life

03:29.860 --> 03:32.420
without thought of consequence.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.670
I don't know whether he
told you that or not.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.383
I know what he does.

03:38.490 --> 03:41.200
I know Jules, his
assistant. (camera clicks)

03:41.200 --> 03:42.280
I know Becky (camera clicks)

03:42.280 --> 03:45.020
and all the other models on his list.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.490
You see, Tom thinks we have no idea

03:47.490 --> 03:49.073
about his other profession.

03:49.910 --> 03:52.563
But there is something very
rotten in this Denmark.

03:55.519 --> 03:56.352
So, Tara,

03:59.400 --> 04:00.403
that's my life.

04:01.740 --> 04:02.640
Let's take it slow

04:04.830 --> 04:08.074
because I reckon we
might have something in a

04:08.074 --> 04:09.374
semi-something background.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.787
Take care.

04:12.787 --> 04:13.620
(camera clicks)

04:13.620 --> 04:14.453
James.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.450
- I love you, baby.

04:20.450 --> 04:21.793
I love you so much.

04:22.938 --> 04:24.521

I'd like to put you up front
if that's all right with you.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.862

Jules have we got the paperwork for that?

08:51.992 --> 08:53.102

08:53.102 --> 08:55.102
I've gotta get this one.

08:56.681 --> 08:57.831
- Want me to come back?

08:59.160 --> 08:59.993
- When?

08:59.993 --> 09:00.826
- Tomorrow.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.990
- I'm on a shoot tomorrow.

09:03.990 --> 09:05.250
- You can shoot me.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.083
- [Tom] No.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.610
We've done that.

09:07.610 --> 09:10.570
- Please, I want to be able
to make things up to you.

09:10.570 --> 09:11.403
- [Tom] How?

09:11.403 --> 09:12.393
- Whatever it takes.

09:13.850 --> 09:15.843
- [Tom] I'm not sure what it would take.

09:17.010 --> 09:18.670
- So what are you doing now?

09:18.670 --> 09:20.010
- [Tom] Now?

09:20.010 --> 09:22.434
- No, I mean in the day.

09:22.434 --> 09:24.350
- [Tom] I'm working.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.100
- What are you doing?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.263
- More photography.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.690
- For who?

09:29.690 --> 09:31.120
- An agency.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.229
- What are you taking photos of?

09:33.229 --> 09:35.010
- Largely clothed women, the same.

09:35.010 --> 09:35.890
- Naked?

09:35.890 --> 09:37.150
- [Tom] Sometimes they get naked.

09:37.150 --> 09:38.760
You know this.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.000
- How naked?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.328
- To be honest with you,

09:41.328 --> 09:43.800
I think they probably just
think I'm a bit of a prude.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.633
- That's what really what
you want to do though, is it?

09:46.633 --> 09:47.466
It's just what gets you off.

09:47.466 --> 09:48.920
- [Tom] It does depress me sometimes.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.770
But then...

09:51.310 --> 09:52.690
- What?

09:52.690 --> 09:53.757
- [Tom] I meet someone like you

09:53.757 --> 09:56.570
and I realise that the
pictures are just that.

09:56.570 --> 09:57.403
Pictures.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.180
This girl this morning.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.648
She was pretty, perfectly formed,

10:01.648 --> 10:03.274
nice body,

10:03.274 --> 10:05.623
an angel face.

10:06.925 --> 10:07.758
But you know what?

10:07.758 --> 10:09.150
I didn't want her.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.160
I didn't love her.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.260
(camera clicks)

10:11.260 --> 10:12.540
(ominous music)

10:12.540 --> 10:13.716
I could see that the pictures of her

10:13.716 --> 10:14.926
would be someone's fantasy.

10:14.926 --> 10:15.921
(camera clicks)

10:15.921 --> 10:16.754
Not mine.

10:16.754 --> 10:17.587
Some other guys.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.570
- Am I still your fantasy?

10:20.570 --> 10:22.500
- [Tom] I create fantasy.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.003
You know the answer to that.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.020
- Whatever happened to my pictures?

10:27.020 --> 10:29.206
- [Tom] They're in the same place.

10:29.206 --> 10:31.260
I've not looked at 'em since I took them.

10:31.260 --> 10:32.360
- You didn't see them?

10:33.254 --> 10:36.080
- [Tom] No, that was my possessive streak.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.503
- Do you still want me?

10:40.350 --> 10:42.860
- Look, can you cope
with me taking photos?

10:42.860 --> 10:45.997
I mean, it's a serious question.

10:45.997 --> 10:47.593
It's a bit of a deal breaker.

10:48.850 --> 10:50.360
- Do you fancy the girls?

10:50.360 --> 10:51.900
Do you want them?

10:51.900 --> 10:53.023
- No, not really.

10:54.660 --> 10:55.760
- Not really isn't no.

10:56.607 --> 11:00.053
- [Tom] For god's sake, I
can separate work from play.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.090
- Please.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.760
Let me come back.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.893
Just so we can see.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.600
- Where are you now?

11:12.600 --> 11:13.883
- My parents' house.

11:14.986 --> 11:16.380
- Are you gonna come over?

11:16.380 --> 11:17.320
- Why?

11:17.320 --> 11:19.553
- Well, that's what you
usually do when I'm working.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.710
- So, I can sleep.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.060
We can talk in the morning.

11:25.170 --> 11:28.530
(ominous music)

11:28.530 --> 11:29.363
I love you.

11:31.284 --> 11:32.117
- Yeah.

11:32.117 --> 11:33.217
I love you, too.

11:33.217 --> 11:35.203
- Are you being fucking serious?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.554
- [Tom] Look, I'm on a
shoot this afternoon.

11:40.554 --> 11:41.689
- Can I come?

11:41.689 --> 11:43.246
- [Tom] No.

11:43.246 --> 11:44.413
I'm sorry, you're not in the shoot.

11:45.390 --> 11:47.290
Jules is the assistant, you know that.

11:48.130 --> 11:49.130
- I like Jules.

11:49.130 --> 11:51.247
- [Tom] Yeah, I like Jules, too.

11:51.247 --> 11:52.330
- Have you ever fucked Jules?

11:52.330 --> 11:53.340
- [Tom] Don't start.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.755
- Why not?

11:54.755 --> 11:59.028
- Because we both know
you've got your own problems.

11:59.028 --> 12:01.778
(birds chirping)

12:40.895 --> 12:43.562
(ominous music)

12:57.110 --> 12:58.910
- [James] The wedding is next month.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.513
You are invited.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.687
We would both appreciate seeing you there.

13:07.902 --> 13:09.202
- A word of advice, James.

13:10.510 --> 13:12.413
If you can live with men in deceit,

13:13.310 --> 13:14.760
you'll have a happy marriage.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.963
If you can't, then don't marry a liar.

13:21.245 --> 13:23.912
(camera clicks)

13:26.980 --> 13:27.813
That's all.

13:29.340 --> 13:30.500
- [James] I never realised

13:30.500 --> 13:34.320
you had such a high opinion of Lisa.

13:34.320 --> 13:38.717
But I take your advice.

13:42.740 --> 13:43.897
I'll see myself out.

13:47.823 --> 13:50.490
(door clatters)

13:59.203 --> 14:01.870
(ominous music)

14:21.495 --> 14:23.995
(birds chirp)

14:25.407 --> 14:27.130
- Do you think I'm luckY?

14:27.130 --> 14:27.963
- Lucky?

14:29.490 --> 14:30.630
How are we lucky?

14:30.630 --> 14:33.420
I mean, I've worked for
everything, haven't I?

14:33.420 --> 14:34.253
- Have you?

14:36.473 --> 14:38.690
- Come on, Lisa, what's wrong?

14:38.690 --> 14:40.600
I mean, you're not with
your sisters at the moment.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.143
But, the new house, is it too much?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.080
- No.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.043
It's perfect.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.903
It just seems so extravagant
after what we last had.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.860
- Yeah, but wouldn't your
dad like to see you now?

14:55.860 --> 14:58.830
- Yeah, well, my dad's not
here to see it anymore, James.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.913
- He's still around in spirit.

15:01.845 --> 15:03.445
- It's just difficult, you know.

15:07.444 --> 15:08.744
- You've got family, Lisa.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.300
We've got great times ahead of us.

15:12.380 --> 15:13.250
- Yeah, I know.

15:14.703 --> 15:16.363
I just feel so guilty.

15:17.470 --> 15:19.283
I've got everything but nothing.

15:22.087 --> 15:22.920
(glass bangs)

15:22.920 --> 15:24.280
- We don't have nothing, Lisa.

15:26.087 --> 15:27.180
Are you keeping up with that prescription?

15:27.180 --> 15:28.730
- No, I can't.

15:28.730 --> 15:30.890
It's just making me feel even worse.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.290
- Come on, you need to take taking them

15:32.290 --> 15:33.973
if you want them to work.

15:33.973 --> 15:36.443
Hey, look, how's Maria
getting on with Charlotte?

15:38.651 --> 15:39.830
- We wouldn't even be
living if she didn't look

15:39.830 --> 15:41.063
after her so well.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.790
She's more of a mother than I am.

15:44.929 --> 15:47.903
- Yeah, but, Lisa, you're her mother.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.013
Come on.

15:52.310 --> 15:54.604
Don't beat yourself up over this.

15:54.604 --> 15:58.190
I mean, we have been through
so much in the past year.

15:58.190 --> 16:01.360
- That's why I'm saying, aren't we lucky.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.150
We've got all of this.

16:03.150 --> 16:05.503
All of these material
things and at what price?

16:10.690 --> 16:12.510
- Your dad's gone, Lisa.

16:12.510 --> 16:13.810
I'm sorry.

16:13.810 --> 16:15.720
I don't know what I can do about it.

16:15.720 --> 16:16.920
- He's always been gone.

16:20.860 --> 16:24.053
- We go over this every night.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.580
- It's just so difficult.

16:29.580 --> 16:32.430
And you know why it's so difficult for me.

16:32.430 --> 16:33.263
- What?

16:33.263 --> 16:35.200
I mean, what is so difficult?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.600
- You.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.790
You look like him.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.303
You dress like him, and you act like him.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.084
- I can't help that.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.013
- I know.

16:47.013 --> 16:47.946
I know you can't.

16:47.946 --> 16:50.000
I just, it's so difficult.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.280
I just, I look across the room,

16:51.280 --> 16:53.010
and I don't know whether
I'm looking at my husband

16:53.010 --> 16:54.323
or my dad anymore.

16:58.120 --> 16:58.953
- I listen.

17:00.230 --> 17:01.113
I listen.

17:02.883 --> 17:03.716
And I listen.

17:04.930 --> 17:06.242
And then I realise,

17:08.270 --> 17:12.540
I just can't help you unless
you're prepared to let go

17:12.540 --> 17:14.252
and tell me.

17:16.364 --> 17:19.587
- Tell you what?

17:19.587 --> 17:23.319
- You've got to tell me
what happened to him.

17:23.319 --> 17:26.010
I mean, the whole thing with
your dad is just an excuse.

17:26.010 --> 17:27.410
Or at least it's become one.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.280
- What do you want to hear, James?

17:33.280 --> 17:35.380
That daddy had me, is that what you think?

17:39.551 --> 17:40.384
- Maybe.

17:41.385 --> 17:42.253
I don't know.

17:42.253 --> 17:43.823
I honestly don't know.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.510
- Well, daddy didn't have me, James.

17:46.510 --> 17:48.960
Sorry to disappoint you
if that idea got you off.

17:52.630 --> 17:53.603
- Stop it, Lisa.

17:55.330 --> 17:56.380
I think you're drunk.

18:01.350 --> 18:02.183
- All right.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.393
I'll tell you.

18:05.830 --> 18:06.830
Do you remember Tom?

18:08.270 --> 18:09.400
- Tom?

18:09.400 --> 18:11.000
Yeah.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.589
Used to be in IT,

18:12.589 --> 18:14.500
moved to another department.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.643
A photographer now, I think.

18:18.610 --> 18:19.750
Where are you going with this, Lisa?

18:19.750 --> 18:22.227
I mean, (laughs)

18:22.227 --> 18:23.273
have you had an affair?

18:24.241 --> 18:25.375
Is that what this is?

18:25.375 --> 18:29.030
Is that what this has all been about?

18:29.030 --> 18:32.310
- At the Christmas
party, Tom came up to me

18:33.730 --> 18:35.323
and he said,

18:37.470 --> 18:38.303
he said.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.180
I was with this girl.

18:41.180 --> 18:46.180
And nothing happened, but we
were really close friends.

18:46.430 --> 18:48.340
And then we had this
five minute conversation

18:48.340 --> 18:49.643
that destroyed my life.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.177
- All right, I get it.

18:54.177 --> 18:58.230
And it was you he had the
five minute conversation with?

18:58.230 --> 19:01.903
- Yeah, but the five minute
conversation didn't happen then.

19:03.860 --> 19:05.160
- When did it happen then?

19:06.002 --> 19:07.602
- A few years ago when I was 16.

19:08.786 --> 19:10.023
- And what else did he say?

19:15.360 --> 19:16.843
- Not a day goes by when I don't think

19:16.843 --> 19:18.403
about what I said.

19:22.215 --> 19:25.320
- So what was this stupid conversation

19:25.320 --> 19:26.980
a few years ago about?

19:26.980 --> 19:27.813
- Not much.

19:27.813 --> 19:29.470
He just said if he was to look after me,

19:29.470 --> 19:31.270
it's because I needed looking after.

19:32.410 --> 19:34.580
Because he thought

19:34.580 --> 19:36.973
that my mom didn't treat me right.

19:39.567 --> 19:42.460
- So he liked you.

19:42.460 --> 19:43.293
So what?

19:45.150 --> 19:47.400
- Something else happened
a week before then.

19:49.257 --> 19:53.260
It wasn't much, but I felt so stupid

19:53.260 --> 19:54.360
for letting it happen.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.760
I got drunk, and I got taken advantage of.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.600
- I thought we talked about
everything we had to tell

20:05.600 --> 20:07.380
each other about our private lives.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.830
- Yeah, well, some things
have to remain private.

20:11.550 --> 20:15.083
- So you're telling me this one bad.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.173
- Look, it was a bad first time, okay?

20:20.760 --> 20:23.493
- And this bad first
time was with Tom, right?

20:24.347 --> 20:25.180
- No.

20:26.270 --> 20:27.180
This prick wasn't Tom.

20:27.180 --> 20:28.483
It was somebody else.

20:28.483 --> 20:30.270
I can't remember his name.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.460
- So, come on, tell me.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.903
What has all this got to do with Tom?

20:37.660 --> 20:38.983
- I destroyed his life.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.040
- Do you remember that film
we watched the other night?

20:45.040 --> 20:47.323
- I don't see the films you see.

20:48.270 --> 20:50.070
- There always on in the background.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.220
- But I'm not obsessed like you.

20:54.270 --> 20:56.070
- Who says I'm obsessed?

20:56.070 --> 20:57.363
You do.

20:57.363 --> 20:58.260
How does that work?

20:58.260 --> 20:59.223
- You know you are.

21:00.421 --> 21:02.180
- Is it really that bad?

21:02.180 --> 21:04.363
- No, it's not that bad.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.820
- Is it good then?

21:06.820 --> 21:08.830
- No, it's not that good, either.

21:08.830 --> 21:12.020
- Why is there always
a barrier between us?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.470
- Because I don't hero
worship the people you do.

21:15.852 --> 21:16.930
- Who expects you to?

21:16.930 --> 21:18.380
- You do.

21:18.380 --> 21:22.520
Every time you say something,
all it is with you is

21:22.520 --> 21:23.440
did you see this?

21:23.440 --> 21:24.430
Did you see that?

21:24.430 --> 21:25.750
Do you remember this?

21:25.750 --> 21:26.660
I didn't.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.240
Period.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.100
Things are strained
enough as they are already

21:30.100 --> 21:32.250
without you stretching
things even further.

21:33.870 --> 21:35.338
- I'm trying to live here.

21:35.338 --> 21:36.171
What?

21:36.171 --> 21:37.671
What are you talking about?

21:37.671 --> 21:41.060
- It's been four months already.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.580
- And, and what?

21:43.542 --> 21:44.741
- What?

21:44.741 --> 21:46.030
- Do you think I'm not thinking about it?

21:46.030 --> 21:48.781
You think I'm not
thinking about our little?

21:48.781 --> 21:51.060
Look, I can't do this right now.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.340
I've been out of the loop for a reason.

21:53.340 --> 21:54.510
- Maybe I am, too.

21:56.664 --> 21:58.414
- Why are we arguing?

21:59.777 --> 22:02.277
- Because everything around
here is dead or dying.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.391
You get me involved with you

22:05.391 --> 22:08.793
and drag me through
all this shit for what?

22:10.610 --> 22:12.660
I should be with my
friends finishing one part

22:12.660 --> 22:14.360
of my life and beginning the next.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.350
I could even finish my
education if I want.

22:16.350 --> 22:18.890
But no, I hook myself up with you.

22:18.890 --> 22:20.060
For what?

22:20.060 --> 22:22.504
This tragedy and torment.

22:22.504 --> 22:26.390
You just sit there and watch the films.

22:26.390 --> 22:27.860
That's where you live.

22:27.860 --> 22:29.490
Movie land.

22:29.490 --> 22:31.470
And where do I fit in for you?

22:31.470 --> 22:32.962
I don't.

22:32.962 --> 22:36.393
Is that whole truth or what?

22:38.150 --> 22:40.400
You love me so much

22:40.400 --> 22:42.630
that you think that by forgetting me

22:42.630 --> 22:45.950
I'm going to forget about
what has happened to us.

22:45.950 --> 22:47.490
But I'm not

22:47.490 --> 22:48.940
because I need you to help me.

22:48.940 --> 22:50.900
I need you to be here with me.

22:50.900 --> 22:54.240
And to do that, you have to
invest your emotions in me.

22:54.240 --> 22:58.140
- I don't think I'm ready for this.

22:58.140 --> 22:59.690
- Then how do you think I feel?

23:01.110 --> 23:03.810
I need to move on so badly from this,

23:03.810 --> 23:05.890
but I just don't think I can.

23:05.890 --> 23:07.410
- Then don't.

23:07.410 --> 23:09.060
- I've got to.

23:09.060 --> 23:10.493
I can't let this kill me.

23:12.410 --> 23:13.510
- Let it kill me then.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.550
- No, it has already.

23:17.550 --> 23:20.509
We have to find something
that's going to help us.

23:20.509 --> 23:25.370
- We should never have got involved.

23:25.370 --> 23:26.370
- I don't care.

23:26.370 --> 23:28.713
We are involved, and we
have to find something

23:28.713 --> 23:30.780
that is going to make this better.

23:30.780 --> 23:32.303
That is going to help us.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.391
- Maybe we should start from scratch then.

23:36.391 --> 23:38.620
- How do you mean?

23:38.620 --> 23:40.530
- Relive everything that we've done

23:40.530 --> 23:42.193
up until four months ago.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.400
- And how can we do that?

23:47.110 --> 23:49.623
- I've been doing that
every day in my head.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.520
Every time I'm watching those films,

23:52.520 --> 23:54.420
I'm not actually watching those films.

23:55.950 --> 23:58.710
I'm watching our life
in exact, minute detail,

23:58.710 --> 24:00.920
and I see the happiness in your face

24:00.920 --> 24:02.033
turn to despair.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.220
My legs give way, but I
know what's just happened.

24:08.065 --> 24:12.483
I hate that movie in my head.

24:13.567 --> 24:16.413
I wish I could erase it, but I can't.

24:20.630 --> 24:21.463
- Well,

24:22.340 --> 24:24.432
make a film about me then.

24:24.432 --> 24:25.265
- I can't.

24:25.265 --> 24:26.468
- You always said you would.

24:26.468 --> 24:27.301
- I can't.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.134
- Why not?

24:29.190 --> 24:31.410
- Because I don't have the drive anymore.

24:31.410 --> 24:33.226
I can't even get out of bed any more.

24:33.226 --> 24:34.393
You know that.

24:35.258 --> 24:36.804
- Well, then how do you think I feel?

24:36.804 --> 24:40.300
Do you not think I feel
like that a little bit, too?

24:40.300 --> 24:41.133
Look at me.

24:42.380 --> 24:44.840
I can't live with myself,
and I'm asking you

24:44.840 --> 24:47.963
to help me and help us.

24:50.350 --> 24:53.020
Look, you've got that
stupid little video camera.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.710
Why don't you use it?

24:54.710 --> 24:56.107
And we can use it to--

24:56.107 --> 24:59.607
- I bought that video camera for a reason.

25:01.470 --> 25:02.303
- I know.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.840
I know, to make a film.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.477
But that changed.

25:06.477 --> 25:10.430
It was going to be a film about
someone entering this world,

25:10.430 --> 25:12.770
and it was going to be beautiful.

25:12.770 --> 25:16.030
But, as much as it hurts me to say this,

25:16.030 --> 25:18.553
that is never going to happen.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.465
- Why didn't we even name her?

25:24.465 --> 25:25.548
- I couldn't.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.823
- I had a list and everything.

25:30.507 --> 25:33.110
- Okay, you had a list.

25:33.110 --> 25:35.120
What would you have named her?

25:35.120 --> 25:36.600
- Tara.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.100
- I don't like Tara.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.893
- Tara's important to me.

25:39.893 --> 25:41.491
- I know because you
made it important to you.

25:41.491 --> 25:43.012
- Fine.

25:43.012 --> 25:44.353
What would you have named her then?

25:45.660 --> 25:47.283
- I don't know.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.975
- [James] Hi, Jan.

25:50.975 --> 25:51.808
This is James.

25:51.808 --> 25:52.641
- Hi James.

25:53.680 --> 25:56.013
So what's wrong with
little fruitcake this time?

25:58.055 --> 26:01.160
- [James] Depressed, suicidal.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.040
Usual problems for a 19 year old girl

26:03.040 --> 26:05.640
who's lost her dad and was
neglected by her mother

26:05.640 --> 26:07.480
for most of her life.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.313
- Fly away, James.

26:08.313 --> 26:09.583
We've all got problems.

26:10.490 --> 26:12.360
- [James] Lisa is ill,

26:12.360 --> 26:13.940
but she's making herself worse

26:13.940 --> 26:16.690
because she won't face up to her issues.

26:16.690 --> 26:18.053
Yourself, included.

26:19.003 --> 26:21.050
Oh, I don't know exactly
what she blames you for.

26:21.050 --> 26:22.443
Daddy, possible.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.340
But you don't stop upsetting her

26:25.340 --> 26:28.080
whether she hears from you or not.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.420
- Mothers and daughters, James.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.724
Not fathers and sons.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.857
- [James] Look, we're not
going to let this descend

26:33.857 --> 26:34.690
into an argument.

26:37.260 --> 26:38.093
- Try me.

26:40.360 --> 26:44.243
- [James] I want to come
over for dinner on Sunday.

26:46.749 --> 26:47.582
- Can't.

26:49.012 --> 26:49.845
- [James] No, I can.

26:49.845 --> 26:52.578
But Sunday was always
supposed to be family day.

26:52.578 --> 26:53.576
(laughs)

26:53.576 --> 26:54.409
- Been playing detective, have we?

26:54.409 --> 26:55.800
Lisa would never call it that.

26:57.779 --> 26:59.430
- [James] I don't care.

26:59.430 --> 27:02.200
But, all right, I just
want a civilised meal.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.263
Can we manage that?

27:08.620 --> 27:09.570
- How is Lisa then?

27:12.240 --> 27:14.070
- [James] Your sister hates me

27:14.070 --> 27:17.619
as much as you probably do at the moment.

27:17.619 --> 27:18.680
- My god.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.420
Little girl must be ill.

27:20.420 --> 27:23.121
Replacement daddy must
have really pissed her off.

27:23.121 --> 27:24.428
- [James] So you think I really am

27:24.428 --> 27:26.290
that much like her father?

27:26.290 --> 27:27.593
- Unfortunately, you are.

27:28.759 --> 27:30.550
- [James] All right, tell me.

27:30.550 --> 27:31.383
What went wrong?

27:32.437 --> 27:34.623
- Mom never really did like him that much.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.625
He was too devoted to
his job and not to me.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.470
But that's on me, isn't it?

27:41.470 --> 27:43.713
First kid at 16, last at 32.

27:44.740 --> 27:45.580
Look at me.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.000
I lived my life.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.881
I never wanted children,
now I've got three.

27:49.881 --> 27:54.283
Me and my mom and Vicky, we
forced our dad to walk away.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.723
Lisa was what, 10, when that happened.

27:58.940 --> 28:00.930
Her dad was there everyday of her life,

28:00.930 --> 28:02.067
not a day apart ever.

28:02.067 --> 28:03.483
And then he was gone.

28:05.420 --> 28:06.450
And now he really is dead.

28:06.450 --> 28:07.653
He won't be coming home.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.220
The whole time that he was alive,

28:12.220 --> 28:13.533
she had that hope.

28:14.370 --> 28:16.000
You can't replace that feeling of hope

28:16.000 --> 28:18.193
by looking like him and being like him.

28:19.110 --> 28:21.050
That's why Lisa's ill, James.

28:21.050 --> 28:22.740
Her dad's gone and her sisters know

28:22.740 --> 28:24.493
she was daddy's fucking girl.

28:28.191 --> 28:29.100
There.

28:29.100 --> 28:32.077
That's the most sincere
conversation I've ever had with you.

28:33.702 --> 28:37.533
- [James] Well, Jan, I
appreciate your honesty.

28:39.410 --> 28:40.243
- Sunday then.

28:42.216 --> 28:43.475
- [James] See you on Sunday.

You're right.

29:33.740 --> 29:36.033
I'm not entirely sure what
you want me to say here.

29:39.620 --> 29:40.820
I supposed we could, um,

29:42.140 --> 29:43.390
start from the beginning.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.530
I've been drinking.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.750
I've been drinking a lot.

29:58.290 --> 30:01.140
Smoking, too, and I guess
that's to do with the drinking.

30:03.230 --> 30:04.410
Don't feel like I'm 30.

30:04.410 --> 30:07.950
I feel like I'm 10 years
old and I'm peddling home

30:07.950 --> 30:09.850
like a nutcase on my tiny little BMX

30:09.850 --> 30:11.600
because some bigger kid swatted me.

30:13.350 --> 30:14.183
I'm scared.

30:16.583 --> 30:18.883
I've no idea what I'm scared of.

30:22.303 --> 30:24.503
I don't want to go out
in the big, wide world.

30:27.270 --> 30:28.103
Why?

30:30.450 --> 30:32.250
I just don't have the ability to do it.

30:32.250 --> 30:33.083
I can't cope.

(car rumbles)

30:55.680 --> 30:57.003
- [James] How are you then?

30:58.147 --> 30:59.163
- [Lisa] Not as low.

31:04.110 --> 31:05.610
- [James] Are you on top then?

31:06.660 --> 31:07.523
- I think so.

31:08.707 --> 31:10.303
Maria and I took Charlotte out.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.360
Maria showed us some of the little things

31:13.360 --> 31:16.560
that she likes that I just can't do.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.163
You know, the lovely things.

31:21.639 --> 31:24.890
- [James] Are you happier
with your daughter now?

31:24.890 --> 31:26.500
- No.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.120
- [James] Why not?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.650
- She looks like me.

31:29.650 --> 31:32.550
It's like having a miniature
me running around everywhere.

31:34.940 --> 31:39.140
- [James] Doesn't she
have any of me in her?

31:39.140 --> 31:40.960
- She shits and pukes.

31:40.960 --> 31:41.983
Is that enough?

31:43.930 --> 31:45.180
- [James] Is that a joke?

31:46.440 --> 31:47.273
- Sort of.

31:48.660 --> 31:49.800
I just look at the baby,

31:49.800 --> 31:53.540
and, no, I don't see you in her

31:53.540 --> 31:55.893
because I'm so wrapped
up in seeing me in her.

31:57.890 --> 32:02.100
I just think, what's gonna
happen when she grows up,

32:02.100 --> 32:06.430
and one day, she can't
find daddy in the house?

32:06.430 --> 32:08.137
That's why I don't see you in her.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.683
That's just the way it is, James.

32:14.660 --> 32:17.440
- We're gonna have a
proper lunch on Sunday

32:17.440 --> 32:19.120
at your sister's here.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.270
- [Lisa] What's proper?

32:21.780 --> 32:23.780
- [James] I've got a friend coming over.

32:26.408 --> 32:27.808
- [Lisa] Who else is coming?

32:28.860 --> 32:29.693
- [James] Tom.

32:32.140 --> 32:32.973
- Say again?

32:33.980 --> 32:34.813
- [James] Tom.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.621
You know, my campaign photographer.

32:38.530 --> 32:40.260
- Yeah, I know who he is.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.093
Do you?

32:42.010 --> 32:43.570
- [James] Yeah.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.490
I think he's someone you
need to meet up with again.

32:46.490 --> 32:49.630
I mean, he's pretty sincere about things.

32:49.630 --> 32:50.900
You know, you really pushed his life

32:50.900 --> 32:52.163
in a different direction.

32:54.406 --> 32:55.620
- Are you happy now you found out

32:55.620 --> 32:57.020
a little bit extra about me?

33:00.150 --> 33:02.470
- [James] That's why he's
coming over on Sunday.

33:02.470 --> 33:04.553
- [Lisa] I can't have you
around here like this.

33:05.980 --> 33:08.280
- [James] Can I see my daughter first?

33:08.280 --> 33:09.113
- [Lisa] No.

Tom from then, James?

35:06.030 --> 35:08.293
He works for you, I assume.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.610
- I think you met him before.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.480
You see, I'm his boss.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.850
But he used to be friends with Lisa here.

35:21.359 --> 35:26.300
Well, that was until she made
an allegation against him.

35:26.300 --> 35:28.278
But I think they've sorted things out now.

35:28.278 --> 35:29.993
Right, Lisa?

35:32.460 --> 35:35.030
- You were at school
then, weren't you, Lisa?

35:35.030 --> 35:35.933
I remember him.

35:37.330 --> 35:39.380
I went along with Lisa to keep her quiet.

35:41.420 --> 35:44.050
- You know, I can believe that now.

35:44.890 --> 35:46.740
- It was only four years ago, James.

35:46.740 --> 35:49.303
You make it sound like she's
done something similar to you.

35:50.510 --> 35:53.293
- Time heals, apparently.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.023
- It that what you think, James?

35:59.972 --> 36:00.805
- Yes.

36:01.853 --> 36:02.686
Yes, I do.

36:05.270 --> 36:08.580
Tom obviously can't make it.

36:08.580 --> 36:13.203
So, let's drink to the future.

36:14.300 --> 36:16.440
- The past is the past.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.106
To the future.

36:18.106 --> 36:19.189
- The future.

36:30.130 --> 36:31.423
- I'm leaving you, James.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.437
I want a divorce because I hate you.

36:39.730 --> 36:43.070
- I want your heart on a chopping block

36:43.070 --> 36:46.643
because you are deliberately
making a scene, dear.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.310
We all know you're ill.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.533
- I'm not ill, James.

36:55.710 --> 36:58.313
I just realised that I hate you.

37:01.543 --> 37:04.220
- And I hate you, too.

37:04.220 --> 37:05.053
I mean, come on.

37:05.053 --> 37:08.963
What have you ever actually done for me?

37:11.780 --> 37:13.010
- You got to work all hours

37:13.010 --> 37:14.433
and just leave me by myself.

37:18.390 --> 37:21.023
- Jan, have you seen my baby?

37:22.200 --> 37:25.130
It's the ugliest thing you've ever seen.

37:25.130 --> 37:28.420
She makes me sick every
time I look at her.

37:28.420 --> 37:29.253
I hate it.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.323
- Lisa, get a grip.

37:32.185 --> 37:33.640
You just don't know the problem.

37:33.640 --> 37:34.600
- What problem?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.310
He is the problem.

37:36.310 --> 37:39.499
- No, the problem is that you
can't keep your legs shut.

37:39.499 --> 37:42.571
- Jan, how dare you?

37:42.571 --> 37:43.404
- No, no.

37:44.277 --> 37:46.140
You and I might not have
had the best relationship,

37:46.140 --> 37:47.690
but I'm not stupid.

37:47.690 --> 37:50.810
Your husband might be, but
your boyfriend certainly isn't.

37:50.810 --> 37:54.110
- James, go into the other room.

37:54.110 --> 37:55.540
Now.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.940
I want to talk to my sister.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.270
- Do you want me to tell you the truth?

38:06.270 --> 38:08.320
Or do you think you can mutter it?

38:08.320 --> 38:10.300
Do you want to know why
you're hurting so much?

38:10.300 --> 38:11.170
Why you're so low?

38:11.170 --> 38:12.873
Why you can't appreciate this?

38:15.180 --> 38:16.150
- I don't know who her dad is.

38:16.150 --> 38:16.983
- Yes, you do.

38:19.234 --> 38:20.343
- I don't know what to do.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.973
- Divorce, dear, and custody will follow.

38:26.430 --> 38:27.930
- How did I manage to ruin it?

38:29.590 --> 38:31.380
- You haven't ruined it yet.

38:31.380 --> 38:32.520
You've upset a lot of people,

38:32.520 --> 38:33.983
but you haven't ruined it.

38:35.190 --> 38:37.253
James, come in here, will yoU?

38:41.820 --> 38:42.970
Lisa, Charlotte, and I will be staying

38:42.970 --> 38:45.120
at my house for a few weeks.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.070
She needs to see a few people at least.

38:52.078 --> 38:55.383
- Is this what you really want, Lisa?

39:06.700 --> 39:07.667
- I don't love you.

39:09.470 --> 39:11.133
I haven't loved you for so long.

39:12.370 --> 39:15.593
I'm sorry, this just isn't a life for me.

39:29.428 --> 39:31.928
(door clicks)

39:33.542 --> 39:36.125
(guitar music)

40:02.580 --> 40:05.663
(footsteps approach)

40:17.650 --> 40:19.510
- They didn't really say much.

40:19.510 --> 40:21.030
- Can I watch it?

40:21.030 --> 40:23.020
- No, not while I'm here.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.570
- Do you want to watch mine?

40:24.570 --> 40:25.943
- No.

40:25.943 --> 40:26.776
- Why not?

40:28.269 --> 40:29.519
- I don't know.

40:30.592 --> 40:33.949
You're absolutely beautiful.

40:33.949 --> 40:35.249
You're absolutely amazing.

40:36.885 --> 40:39.718
- You can fuck me then, can't you?

40:42.630 --> 40:45.080
- Is this what you did
when you divorced dad?

40:45.080 --> 40:46.870
- I didn't divorce your dad, Lisa.

40:46.870 --> 40:47.703
Our mother did.

40:48.729 --> 40:49.810
Except when he walked away from us,

40:49.810 --> 40:52.410
he was more than happy to
keep his attention on you.

40:54.296 --> 40:56.120
- Did you make his life that bad?

40:56.120 --> 40:57.630
- I can't tell you that.

40:57.630 --> 40:59.313
- You destroyed him, didn't you?

41:00.240 --> 41:01.690
- Not before he destroyed me.

41:06.710 --> 41:09.090
- Why didn't you just tell
me that a few years ago?

41:09.090 --> 41:10.190
- You couldn't listen.

41:12.010 --> 41:12.843
Do you remember when you were at school,

41:12.843 --> 41:15.320
you accused that man of nothing?

41:15.320 --> 41:17.067
- It wasn't nothing.

41:17.067 --> 41:18.330
- It was nothing, it was pathetic.

41:18.330 --> 41:20.170
You can never fool me, Lisa.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.510
You can deceive everybody else,

41:21.510 --> 41:23.853
but you were never a very good liar.

41:25.070 --> 41:27.789
- You neglected me for so long.

41:27.789 --> 41:29.873
- Yes, I did.

41:31.090 --> 41:33.600
Our father made you into this little brat.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.810
You had everything when you wanted it.

41:35.810 --> 41:38.920
You swallowed through life
as if it was just you.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.050
When dad came around to visit,
he was interested in you.

41:42.050 --> 41:44.313
Not me or Vicky, not your sisters.

41:44.313 --> 41:47.250
He wasn't even interested
in being civil to mom.

41:47.250 --> 41:51.030
He was just interested
in you, little baby Lisa.

41:51.030 --> 41:51.963
His darling.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.980
That's why you've picked
these men who indulge you.

41:56.980 --> 41:59.620
That's all dad did, indulge you.

41:59.620 --> 42:00.920
Did he indulge me?

42:00.920 --> 42:01.970
No.

42:01.970 --> 42:02.880
Did he indulge Vicky?

42:02.880 --> 42:04.020
No.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.485
He ignored us.

42:05.485 --> 42:09.756
I ignored him because we went
through the divorce as adults.

42:09.756 --> 42:12.850
We weren't the family.

42:12.850 --> 42:14.063
We were individuals.

42:16.170 --> 42:17.197
And you were just a little girl

42:17.197 --> 42:19.793
wondering why your daddy
wasn't there anymore.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.233
We knew why daddy wasn't there anymore.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.810
We'd all driven him away

42:25.810 --> 42:28.660
because the only person who
was important to him was you.

42:29.750 --> 42:31.390
There.

42:31.390 --> 42:35.003
Jealousy from your
mother and your sisters.

42:40.850 --> 42:43.933
- So that gave you the right
to ignore me every weekend?

42:45.040 --> 42:46.390
- We left you to your own devices

42:46.390 --> 42:48.560
because that's all you would do.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.103
If ever there was a feral
child, it was you, my dear.

42:53.550 --> 42:54.900
- Feral?

42:54.900 --> 42:56.990
What was I, some kind of animal?

42:56.990 --> 42:59.210
- Yes, you were sometimes.

42:59.210 --> 43:01.510
Do you not remember me
picking up this lifeless wreck

43:01.510 --> 43:04.530
from the remains of 100
consecutive house party?

43:04.530 --> 43:05.890
Do you not remember the ambulances

43:05.890 --> 43:09.030
and the days in hospital
having your stomach pumped?

43:09.030 --> 43:10.930
Think about your life, Lisa.

43:10.930 --> 43:13.122
You tried to kill yourself inconspicuously

43:13.122 --> 43:14.540
because you didn't want to have to admit

43:14.540 --> 43:16.340
that you actually had some problems.

43:17.180 --> 43:18.560
Yeah, mother dear may have caused them,

43:18.560 --> 43:19.963
but you exaggerated them.

43:20.833 --> 43:22.870
Look at you.

43:22.870 --> 43:25.140
You had everything, and
you're throwing it away

43:25.140 --> 43:26.900
because you're a selfish bitch

43:26.900 --> 43:28.160
loathing in self pity,

43:28.160 --> 43:30.383
wanting to blame everyone except herself.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.090
There.

43:35.090 --> 43:36.890
Now that's a heart to heart for you.

43:39.591 --> 43:42.810
You're 19 with the experiences
of someone 10 years older

43:42.810 --> 43:44.020
and I'm telling you to grow up

43:44.020 --> 43:45.850
and take on some responsibility.

43:45.850 --> 43:48.380
Or else you'll be dead in
the gutter like you were

43:48.380 --> 43:49.433
when you were 16.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.310
You blame your life on stupid men

43:54.310 --> 43:56.669
who've been fool enough to look after you,

43:56.669 --> 43:58.610
but I feel sorry for all of them

43:58.610 --> 44:00.360
because you've cheated all of them.

44:01.780 --> 44:03.700
Now don't cry wolf to me or anyone else

44:03.700 --> 44:06.250
when you realise you've
got real problems up there.

44:12.935 --> 44:14.102
- Is that all?

44:15.929 --> 44:16.762
- That is the first time

44:16.762 --> 44:18.490
I've ever been truly frank with you.

44:20.371 --> 44:22.890
We're apart because we
can tear each other apart.

44:22.890 --> 44:25.473
But now's the moment to
think about your future.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.327
- What?

44:32.327 --> 44:34.830
Are you saying that I should
just go back to James?

44:34.830 --> 44:36.480
- No.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.080
I'm saying the reason you're in this state

44:38.080 --> 44:41.290
is because you've never
taken control of your life.

44:41.290 --> 44:43.610
You're acting like a 13 year old.

44:43.610 --> 44:44.660
For the sake of James,

44:44.660 --> 44:46.733
for the sake of Luke, be an adult.

44:46.733 --> 44:49.523
Don't be the little girl
they've made you think you are.

44:54.450 --> 44:56.860
- Who's going to get custody of Charlotte?

44:56.860 --> 44:58.360
- That's the lawyer's problem.

44:59.332 --> 45:00.582
Does Luke know?

45:02.999 --> 45:04.666
- I don't even know.

45:05.801 --> 45:08.718
- Then leave the next move to them.

45:09.680 --> 45:11.400
Lisa, we've talked through all of this.

45:11.400 --> 45:13.443
These are your decisions now, not mine.

45:17.690 --> 45:19.100
- Hello?

45:19.100 --> 45:23.490
- [James] Tom, it's James, your boss.

45:23.490 --> 45:24.857
Look, I don't really know you,

45:24.857 --> 45:27.563
but I feel I probably should.

45:27.563 --> 45:30.410
I mean, I feel you know
more about my wife, Lisa,

45:30.410 --> 45:32.170
than I actually do.

45:32.170 --> 45:35.120
And you haven't spoken a word
to that girl in years, right?

45:36.450 --> 45:39.900
Anyway, I pulled your file out earlier.

45:39.900 --> 45:41.360
Surprised me.

45:41.360 --> 45:43.950
What are you doing in this job, Tom?

45:43.950 --> 45:47.510
I mean, when it comes to politics, Christ.

45:47.510 --> 45:49.623
You've got more qualifications than me.

45:50.693 --> 45:53.465
- I don't know politics.

45:53.465 --> 45:55.410
- [James] Ah, but you know you do really.

45:55.410 --> 45:57.990
You're not a monkey campaign photographer.

45:57.990 --> 46:02.180
To me, you're more like an office mole.

46:02.180 --> 46:03.920
- Maybe I'm just in it to keep sane.

46:03.920 --> 46:04.890
- [James] Why?

46:04.890 --> 46:06.904
What else do you do?

46:06.904 --> 46:08.592
- It's a light paw.

46:08.592 --> 46:10.046
- [James] What do you mean?

46:10.046 --> 46:12.563
- Well, I meant it when
I said photographer.

46:13.930 --> 46:15.030
- [James] So what have you been doing here

46:15.030 --> 46:17.620
for the past three years?

46:17.620 --> 46:19.060
- Trying to get legitimate.

46:19.060 --> 46:21.237
- [James] Trying to be legitimate, eh?

46:21.237 --> 46:23.273
It doesn't work, does it?

46:24.260 --> 46:25.093
- Not really.

46:26.787 --> 46:27.801
Not when there's the internet.

46:27.801 --> 46:29.390
- [James] Well, listen carefully.

46:29.390 --> 46:32.593
My wife now wants to divorce me.

46:34.980 --> 46:36.590
- Yeah.

46:36.590 --> 46:38.790
I hate your wife probably
as much as you do right now.

46:38.790 --> 46:42.253
So, I suppose I could be your office mole.

46:43.570 --> 46:44.403
- [James] How?

46:46.980 --> 46:49.220
- You know, Luke, lover boy who brings us

46:49.220 --> 46:50.770
all the shit coffee?

46:50.770 --> 46:53.410
- [James] Yeah, I know that idiot

46:53.410 --> 46:56.063
who we still haven't promoted
beyond office junior.

46:57.275 --> 46:58.504
- That's the one.

46:58.504 --> 46:59.337
- [James] I know him.

46:59.337 --> 47:00.688
- That's Lisa's boyfriend.

47:00.688 --> 47:02.209
- [James] For real?

47:02.209 --> 47:03.301
Oh, you're kidding me.

47:03.301 --> 47:05.093
- I'm afraid so.

47:05.093 --> 47:07.393
- [James] Well, thank
you for the heads up.

47:08.440 --> 47:10.090
You know, we might actually
have to have a beer

47:10.090 --> 47:10.923
after all this.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.210
- Yeah.

47:13.210 --> 47:14.540
I'll clear my diary.

47:14.540 --> 47:15.640
- [James] Yeah, I'll see you around.

47:15.640 --> 47:16.990
- See you at work sometime.

47:18.436 --> 47:20.330
- Hey, who was that?

47:20.330 --> 47:23.376
- Oh, it was James from
the campaign headquarters.

47:23.376 --> 47:26.043
(ominous music)

47:27.278 --> 47:30.445
(silverware clatters)

47:43.993 --> 47:46.660
(camera clicks)

47:48.357 --> 47:50.528
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

47:50.528 --> 47:52.278
Will you get over it?

47:53.800 --> 47:55.620
We used to do this all the time

47:55.620 --> 47:56.750
before I got pregnant.

47:56.750 --> 47:58.378
You've got whole books

47:58.378 --> 48:00.190
of lover boy tapes somewhere, I'm sure.

48:00.190 --> 48:01.950
That was our thing.

48:01.950 --> 48:03.606
I wanted to do it, and
I wanted you to do it

48:03.606 --> 48:05.410
because it turned me on.

48:05.410 --> 48:07.370
And now I leave that
stupid machine recording

48:07.370 --> 48:09.410
for five minutes while you're sober enough

48:09.410 --> 48:10.667
to decide whether you
want me to use me or not

48:10.667 --> 48:13.121
and it's the worst thing in the world.

48:13.121 --> 48:16.050
That is what is wrong with you.

48:16.050 --> 48:17.330
You're a hypocrite.

48:17.330 --> 48:19.513
You're an absolute hypocrite.

48:20.660 --> 48:23.360
(ominous music)

48:23.360 --> 48:25.107
So how do you want me then, huh?

48:26.142 --> 48:27.790
You want to fuck me?

48:27.790 --> 48:29.480
Or do you want to be selfish?

48:29.480 --> 48:31.193
I'll do whatever you want.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.640
That's all it is with you, isn't it?

48:51.640 --> 48:54.290
Emotion, guilt, blackmail.

48:54.290 --> 48:57.100
Getting so intense.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.550
Getting jealous that I
might speak to someone

48:58.550 --> 48:59.950
that you don't like.

48:59.950 --> 49:01.193
Being myself.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.610
Look, what is this all about?

49:03.610 --> 49:05.803
It's not like we haven't
done all this before.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.593
- Trust.

49:10.450 --> 49:11.840
Everything that we've been doing here

49:11.840 --> 49:14.580
is about building the
trust that we used to have.

49:14.580 --> 49:15.972
- We can still do that.

49:15.972 --> 49:17.100
Look, this is just one little thing.

49:17.100 --> 49:18.538
It's not gonna ruin.

49:18.538 --> 49:19.371
I mean, what did you think I was gonna do?

49:19.371 --> 49:20.920
Sell the tape?

49:20.920 --> 49:22.250
- You might as well
have been spying on me.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.726
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

49:23.726 --> 49:25.951
Will you get over it?

49:25.951 --> 49:30.333
It's just an excuse, your
whole trust argument.

49:31.750 --> 49:33.190
You're embarrassed because
it's the first time

49:33.190 --> 49:34.217
we've been so much as next to each other.

49:34.217 --> 49:35.670
- I'm not embarrassed.

49:35.670 --> 49:36.503
- [Tara] Then what are you?

49:36.503 --> 49:39.247
- I'm obviously not what
you're looking for anymore.

49:39.247 --> 49:41.953
- [Tara] Don't be stupid.

49:41.953 --> 49:43.520
- Well, we don't want
to be with each other.

49:43.520 --> 49:45.296
We don't want to have sex.

49:45.296 --> 49:46.300
We don't want to do nothing.

49:46.300 --> 49:49.150
The only thing keeping
us together is Tara.

49:49.150 --> 49:52.113
- We never named the baby Tara.

49:52.970 --> 49:55.710
- Well, now that dead little baby Tara

49:55.710 --> 49:58.030
who you never let me
see, touch, or be near

49:58.030 --> 50:00.642
because you cleverly
manipulated the situation

50:00.642 --> 50:03.220
is gonna be called Tara.

50:03.220 --> 50:04.263
Tara Reata.

50:05.530 --> 50:06.663
- Tara Reata?

50:07.690 --> 50:09.320
You bastard.

50:09.320 --> 50:12.060
You want to name our daughter
after some stupid bit

50:12.060 --> 50:14.070
in your stupid favourite film?

50:14.070 --> 50:15.230
How do you think I feel?

50:15.230 --> 50:16.367
Am I not just a little bit helpless, too?

50:16.367 --> 50:17.470
- You're not helpless.

50:17.470 --> 50:18.740
You're a manipulator.

50:18.740 --> 50:19.963
- Fuck off.

50:20.959 --> 50:22.309
- The truth hurts, does it?

50:23.853 --> 50:26.187
All right, maybe I'm just a jealous,

50:26.187 --> 50:29.490
easily embarrassed, prudish, paranoid guy.

50:29.490 --> 50:31.123
But I'm like that for a reason.

50:32.350 --> 50:34.490
- [Tara] How can you blame me
for what happened to our baby?

50:34.490 --> 50:36.180
- Because you didn't want her.

50:36.180 --> 50:38.310
You wanted the life that you have now,

50:38.310 --> 50:40.277
and you just let her go.

50:42.906 --> 50:44.240
And do you remember that one time

50:44.240 --> 50:46.113
that we actually did have something?

50:47.330 --> 50:50.060
And I said to you, you
can do whatever you want.

50:50.060 --> 50:52.570
Do whatever you want as long
as I don't know about it.

50:52.570 --> 50:55.493
And what was that one
thing I told you not to do.

50:57.900 --> 50:59.553
There.

50:59.553 --> 51:01.683
That's betrayal.

51:05.850 --> 51:06.683
- Oh.

51:07.690 --> 51:09.900
So reaching ahead now, is it?

51:09.900 --> 51:10.733
- Yeah, babe.

51:12.140 --> 51:13.740
You've finally opened your eyes.

51:15.750 --> 51:16.913
- Maybe I have.

51:18.830 --> 51:21.580
Well, your baby isn't dead.

51:22.970 --> 51:24.683
Our baby isn't dead.

51:26.180 --> 51:27.513
Your baby isn't dead.

51:29.030 --> 51:30.723
Our baby isn't dead.

51:32.360 --> 51:34.317
Your baby isn't dead.

51:34.317 --> 51:37.150
("Amazing Grace")

52:24.050 --> 52:26.086
- [Lisa] Do you want to read it?

52:26.086 --> 52:28.836
(paper shuffles)

52:37.490 --> 52:38.323
- Well,

52:40.270 --> 52:42.280
now's a good time to
remember who you slept with

52:42.280 --> 52:43.893
if you want a paternity test.

52:45.159 --> 52:47.869
- If he wants a what?

52:47.869 --> 52:48.702
- If he wants to know
if he's the real dad,

52:48.702 --> 52:50.460
then he'll have a test done.

52:51.783 --> 52:53.080
- What if he isn't?

52:53.080 --> 52:55.450
- Wave goodbye to everything you have.

52:55.450 --> 52:57.340
- Well, what if he is?

52:57.340 --> 52:59.093
- Nice, quickie divorce, I guess.

53:05.948 --> 53:07.080
- It says here that he wants access rights

53:07.080 --> 53:08.600
over Charlotte's as well.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.210
This is ridiculous.

53:10.210 --> 53:11.900
Why doesn't he just talk to me about it?

53:11.900 --> 53:13.530
We can sort something out.

53:13.530 --> 53:14.363
Why is he being so heavy handed?

53:14.363 --> 53:15.410
- He's not, Lisa.

53:15.410 --> 53:17.040
He's just respecting the situation

53:17.040 --> 53:19.470
and going through the formalities.

53:19.470 --> 53:21.270
When's the hearing?

53:21.270 --> 53:22.103
- Dunno.

53:26.498 --> 53:27.650
It just says that the application was made

53:27.650 --> 53:29.293
on the 11th of May.

53:30.860 --> 53:32.683
- Well, it'll be about November then.

53:37.802 --> 53:39.302
- I can't do this.

53:41.217 --> 53:45.593
- Lisa, be honest.

53:46.810 --> 53:47.660
Who's the father?

53:49.350 --> 53:50.350
- What do you think?

53:54.140 --> 53:55.240
- It's Luke, isn't it?

54:00.700 --> 54:03.520
- Do sisters always talk about sex?

54:03.520 --> 54:04.353
- Yeah.

54:05.310 --> 54:07.083
Not you and me, though.

54:08.300 --> 54:09.390
- You know, there was only one time

54:09.390 --> 54:11.340
that actually had something with James.

54:14.480 --> 54:15.680
It was before Charlotte.

54:18.360 --> 54:19.860
Just, I thought that there was nothing

54:19.860 --> 54:21.110
that would keep us going.

54:22.202 --> 54:24.602
But, we went to bed, and
he just took me slowly.

54:26.280 --> 54:30.180
But we were so, so close
for those few minutes.

54:30.180 --> 54:31.780
I thought it would last forever.

54:33.300 --> 54:34.133
But it didn't.

54:35.700 --> 54:37.210
It just ruined it.

54:37.210 --> 54:38.363
He ruined the moment.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.390
And I don't think we've ever been able

54:40.390 --> 54:41.663
to get that back since.

54:44.060 --> 54:45.460
- But you've got that bloke.

54:46.524 --> 54:49.120
Can he support you, though?

54:50.720 --> 54:53.210
- I don't care if he can or can't.

54:53.210 --> 54:54.790
I just need that emotional support.

54:54.790 --> 54:56.083
And he has that at least.

54:58.070 --> 55:00.630
- You'd better agree to
a test if they want one.

55:02.548 --> 55:04.123
- Do you think I'm doing the right thing?

55:05.050 --> 55:06.043
Yes, no?

55:07.800 --> 55:09.320
Tell me.

55:09.320 --> 55:12.430
- Lisa, you're gonna have to
work that out for yourself.

55:12.430 --> 55:14.607
Spend some time with your daughter.

55:16.043 --> 55:18.130
- I think now's good time
for us to be straight

55:18.130 --> 55:19.780
with each other, don't you think?

55:20.670 --> 55:22.520
- I've always been straight with you.

55:23.690 --> 55:25.600
It was fun while it lasted.

55:25.600 --> 55:29.150
You had me like a dog, got me pregnant,

55:29.150 --> 55:31.039
convinced me to have the baby.

55:31.039 --> 55:32.233
But I didn't want it.

55:33.660 --> 55:35.640
How deep does that cut?

55:35.640 --> 55:37.944
I bet that cuts real deep.

55:37.944 --> 55:41.140
I didn't want it because
with you as her father,

55:41.140 --> 55:43.290
she would've turned into a little dog,

55:43.290 --> 55:44.980
a little miniature me.

55:44.980 --> 55:47.230
Adored on and doted on,
and where would I be?

55:48.080 --> 55:48.970
Ignored.

55:48.970 --> 55:51.590
I'd become the baby factory
fucked every nine months

55:51.590 --> 55:54.467
to shit out your little
bastards every other year.

55:54.467 --> 55:57.440
Whilst Tara Reata heads your brood

55:57.440 --> 55:58.943
and you live through her.

56:00.567 --> 56:01.573
That's your dream, isn't it?

56:04.290 --> 56:05.123
- Thanks.

56:06.290 --> 56:07.390
Thanks for telling me.

56:11.520 --> 56:13.950
So I know now that you
didn't have a stillbirth.

56:13.950 --> 56:16.350
Is that how you convinced then nurse?

56:16.350 --> 56:18.380
Father didn't want nothing to do with it.

56:18.380 --> 56:19.323
Just fucked off.

56:20.590 --> 56:22.090
I said you were a manipulator.

56:24.970 --> 56:27.650
- It's all crashing down now, isn't it?

56:27.650 --> 56:31.040
The facade of our relationship
has just shattered.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.850
- And you were gonna
live with this secret?

56:33.850 --> 56:35.120
- No.

56:35.120 --> 56:36.700
I was going to dump you first.

56:36.700 --> 56:37.850
That's why I came back.

56:38.700 --> 56:40.580
- I could kill you, I honestly could.

56:40.580 --> 56:41.413
- But you won't.

56:42.639 --> 56:43.770
- Why not?

56:43.770 --> 56:46.570
- Because I still have the
vital threads of information.

56:51.440 --> 56:54.473
I gave birth to a healthy baby, Vivien,

56:55.310 --> 56:58.560
on June the 18th, 2017.

56:58.560 --> 57:00.857
I cuddled her in my arms, named her,

57:00.857 --> 57:02.193
and they took her away.

57:03.096 --> 57:05.070
- Why'd they take her away?

57:05.070 --> 57:06.470
- I put her up for adoption.

57:08.378 --> 57:09.711
- Is she adopted yet?

57:09.711 --> 57:11.982
- I don't care.

57:11.982 --> 57:13.800
- Did you not want her?

57:13.800 --> 57:17.093
- No, I hated the sight of her.

57:17.093 --> 57:19.050
What I could see in her was you and me,

57:19.050 --> 57:21.223
what never has been
and what never will be.

57:23.399 --> 57:24.960
- Vivien.

57:24.960 --> 57:25.813
No second name?

57:27.060 --> 57:28.120
Whose last name did she take?

57:28.120 --> 57:29.540
Mine or yours?

57:29.540 --> 57:31.803
- She's just Vivien Reata.

57:35.740 --> 57:36.573
- Why Vivien?

57:37.845 --> 57:39.570
- Because I never knew

57:39.570 --> 57:41.963
why Tara meant so fucking much to you.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.440
I know it's my name, but I'm not the Tara

57:45.440 --> 57:47.083
that's important to you, am I?

57:48.336 --> 57:50.150
- Is that all you could think of?

57:50.150 --> 57:52.160
Not the fact that you'd
just given our baby away?

57:52.160 --> 57:53.550
Did that just slip your mind?

57:53.550 --> 57:56.330
Oh, my boyfriend, he
wants to name the baby

57:56.330 --> 57:59.260
after his girlfriend
and I have no idea why.

57:59.260 --> 58:02.550
Oh, well, just fucking give it up.

58:02.550 --> 58:04.673
How could you do that?

58:04.673 --> 58:06.901
- I wasn't thinking.

58:06.901 --> 58:08.187
- You were thinking.

58:08.187 --> 58:09.410
And then you disappeared for a month.

58:09.410 --> 58:10.610
How do you think I felt?

58:11.960 --> 58:12.950
I didn't know what was going on.

58:12.950 --> 58:15.390
All I knew, you were at your parents.

58:15.390 --> 58:16.627
Were you?

58:16.627 --> 58:18.883
- Yes, yes I was at my parents.

58:20.807 --> 58:23.727
- I don't even know
what to think any more.

58:23.727 --> 58:25.041
When did you come back?

58:25.041 --> 58:27.080
- A few months ago.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.180
- What time is it now?

58:29.260 --> 58:31.039
- About 11 in the morning.

58:31.039 --> 58:32.939
- And what, what has all of this been?

58:36.100 --> 58:37.770
Has it been a reconciliation?

58:37.770 --> 58:40.113
Has it been what you expected?

58:41.898 --> 58:45.180
- I was expecting a continuation.

58:45.180 --> 58:47.296
- Oh, so you have motives then.

58:47.296 --> 58:48.129
- What are you talking about?

58:48.129 --> 58:49.670
- Let's be straight with each other.

58:49.670 --> 58:51.281
Motives, we both have them.

58:51.281 --> 58:54.817
I thought, I thought you were
coming back to be with me.

58:54.817 --> 58:57.217
But now I know we just
want something different.

58:58.090 --> 59:00.780
Tara, I'm not here to be with you.

59:00.780 --> 59:03.700
I'm here to conclude my life with you.

59:03.700 --> 59:07.113
- But you won't do that
because you love me too much.

59:08.450 --> 59:11.100
- Yeah, I love you enough to know

59:11.100 --> 59:12.960
that this is not gonna work.

59:12.960 --> 59:16.140
This is not gonna happen.

59:16.140 --> 59:18.750
Last night I loved you and I adored you

59:18.750 --> 59:20.370
and I felt things I never felt before,

59:20.370 --> 59:22.990
but not it's just been stripped away.

59:24.086 --> 59:25.720
- Stop it.

59:25.720 --> 59:28.470
Stop, stop it, you bastard.

59:28.470 --> 59:29.680
You're just doing this to hurt me

59:29.680 --> 59:31.080
even more than you need to.

59:31.080 --> 59:33.130
- Don't you think you deserve to be hurt?

59:34.217 --> 59:37.693
I respected everything you
said because I trusted you.

59:39.680 --> 59:40.970
You don't understand trust.

59:40.970 --> 59:42.513
You don't understand anything.

59:43.751 --> 59:45.170
- What don't I understand?

59:45.170 --> 59:46.860
I understand you enough to understand

59:46.860 --> 59:49.467
that I didn't want to
be suffocated anymore.

59:49.467 --> 59:50.583
- Don't we breath as well?

59:51.840 --> 59:54.030
And all you ever did was
ask to be suffocated.

59:54.030 --> 59:54.980
- [Tara] How did I?

59:57.235 --> 59:59.090
- You never took
responsibility for anything

59:59.090 --> 01:00:01.985
that required an ounce
of independent thought.

01:00:01.985 --> 01:00:04.566
- Well, it's really
coming out now, isn't it?

01:00:04.566 --> 01:00:06.092
Well, what do you want?

01:00:06.092 --> 01:00:08.492
Me to start listing your faults?

01:00:08.492 --> 01:00:10.010
Oh, no, wait.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.270
I've done that already.

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.870
- We're gonna be funny, are we?

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:13.703
Cuss at each other.

01:00:13.703 --> 01:00:16.325
Well, it's not gonna work.

01:00:16.325 --> 01:00:19.303
- Okay, just stop.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.333
What do you want?

01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:24.300
It's time to make a decision

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.487
because I just can't hear you anymore.

01:00:27.487 --> 01:00:29.120
- [Tom] I wanted you.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.470
I wanted our baby.

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:32.050
I wanted the life that we should have had,

01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:32.883
but it's,

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.263
it's not gonna happen.

01:00:35.263 --> 01:00:37.100
There's no hope for us.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.393
Not now, not ever.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.506
- Then what are we gonna do?

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:44.953
- [Tom] I'm going to go back to work.

01:00:44.953 --> 01:00:46.110
You may not agree with it.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:48.390
It may make you jealous,
but it pays the bills.

01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:50.973
And, you know, something may come from it.

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:58.080
- And what are we going to do?

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.313
- Live on the sex.

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:09.053
Okay, okay, I'll call up Jules.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.900
You can come on the new shoot.

01:01:23.453 --> 01:01:26.120
(ominous music)

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.043
- [Vicky] It's time to
make some decisions, Lisa.

01:02:40.602 --> 01:02:43.597
- I don't think I can
go on with Luke anymore.

01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:44.913
Not at the moment.

01:02:46.193 --> 01:02:48.857
Not with him.

01:02:48.857 --> 01:02:50.710
- Well, it's time you should know then.

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:53.679
He resigned from James's company
and office a few days ago.

01:02:53.679 --> 01:02:55.377
- What?

01:02:55.377 --> 01:02:58.160
Why did he resign?

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.593
- Well, let's just say
he was pushed a bit.

01:03:08.186 --> 01:03:10.033
- This is so difficult.

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:18.910
- What's changed?

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:20.460
Why the sudden change of heart?

01:03:26.492 --> 01:03:30.159
- I had in my head that
Luke was the father.

01:03:33.385 --> 01:03:34.650
- [Vicky] And he's not.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:36.567
- Yeah, it's a problem.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.333
- James.

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.250
James is the father.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.150
Do you love James?

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.793
- [Lisa] Yeah.

01:03:47.442 --> 01:03:49.846
- You want to get back
with him, don't you?

01:03:49.846 --> 01:03:51.455
- Yes and no.

01:03:51.455 --> 01:03:52.288
- What about Luke?

01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:54.430
- For the first time in my life,

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:57.960
I'm going to make my own
decisions on something.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.793
- For god's sake, kill the
man with a little grace.

01:04:03.828 --> 01:04:05.911
I don't know what to say.

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:08.543
I leave you for one day.

01:04:11.544 --> 01:04:14.377
- [Lisa] You leave me for one day.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.917
- I leave you for one day.

01:04:19.768 --> 01:04:22.018
- You leave me for one day?

01:04:23.917 --> 01:04:25.523
You can't say that.

01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:29.980
Do you remember when you left
me for four weeks with Jan

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.493
to go to Australia?

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.170
Who's gonna talk to me then?

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:36.310
No one.

01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:38.520
No one except maybe Luke.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.470
And the school for giving
me free meal tokens.

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:43.440
And they phoned social services about mom,

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.163
but they couldn't do
anything because I was 16.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.360
Everything that happened then has made me

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.663
who I am now, and I hate it.

01:04:53.059 --> 01:04:55.655
I hate myself.

01:04:55.655 --> 01:04:56.988
I loathe myself.

01:04:58.055 --> 01:05:00.055
(cries)

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.733
Well, aren't you gonna react to me?

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.793
- What am I supposed to do?

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.160
It's over with Luke.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.070
There's nothing left to say, is there?

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:21.110
If that's what you want.

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:22.333
To get back with James?

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.960
- No, I've just realised something.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.120
The reason why I'm like this is

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.390
because I like being
that stupid little girl

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:33.963
who gets told what to do.

01:05:35.509 --> 01:05:37.900
I like being indulged

01:05:38.752 --> 01:05:41.233
because that's all I've ever known.

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.080
I played some old tapes,

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.973
and I jogged a few memories.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:24.993
Got a bit upset.

01:07:26.234 --> 01:07:30.059
Thought about when we
first met up and that.

Lisa.

Lisa, who are you?

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:43.060
I'm really not sure you are anymore.

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:45.626

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.023

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:51.827
That's what you did.

01:08:00.167 --> 01:08:01.763

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.793
- Yeah.

01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:09.140
Yeah, we had everything.

01:08:20.232 --> 01:08:22.314
What am I supposed to do?

01:08:24.508 --> 01:08:25.859
- Look,

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:26.693
I need some

I mean, if I'm gonna be an MP.

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.779
- You need an image.

01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:32.853
I can be that image.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.962
- I need someone who's
gonna be in my home, Lisa.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.149
- I am your home, James.

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:49.433
- It doesn't feel like it at the moment.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:53.649
