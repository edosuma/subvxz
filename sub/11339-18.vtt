00:01.637 --> 00:02.737
Previously
on "Criminal Minds"...

00:02.804 --> 00:04.672
Ian Doyle vanished from prison.

00:04.740 --> 00:05.906
Interpol can't find him.

00:05.974 --> 00:07.074
Am I in danger?

00:07.142 --> 00:08.376
We all are.

00:09.411 --> 00:11.262
Prentiss, get down!

00:11.346 --> 00:12.730
We're looking
for a European team

00:12.814 --> 00:16.216
with considerable training.
For one of them, it's personal.

00:18.053 --> 00:19.520
Hey, what's that?

00:19.588 --> 00:21.105
Bank accounts traceable
to our first two victims.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.658
We might be able to match
the rest of those faces.

00:23.725 --> 00:26.394
Hello, Lauren.
Oh, wait.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.963
Lauren Reynolds died
in a car accident, didn't she?

00:29.031 --> 00:32.732
Come near my team
and I will end you.

00:32.801 --> 00:34.619
You took the only thing
that mattered to me.

00:34.703 --> 00:37.138
So I'm gonna take the only
thing that matters to you...

00:37.205 --> 00:38.639
your life.

00:38.707 --> 00:40.341
All the federal
and international agents

00:40.409 --> 00:42.109
responsible
for tracking him down

00:42.177 --> 00:43.944
are now on his list of targets.

01:20.482 --> 01:22.116
Lauren Reynolds.

01:22.167 --> 01:24.018
This is the guy
I told you about.

01:24.086 --> 01:26.137
He told me everything
but a name.

01:26.221 --> 01:29.457
Ian Doyle. Pleasure.

01:29.524 --> 01:33.010
I love being the man
bringing people together.

01:33.095 --> 01:35.146
Have fun, kids.

01:41.069 --> 01:45.840
Jack told me you were
provisional IRA

01:45.907 --> 01:48.142
Used to be.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.578
Then the peace accord happened.

01:50.645 --> 01:54.148
Now I gotta look for work
like everybody else.

01:54.216 --> 01:56.751
Except...Ian...

01:56.818 --> 01:59.954
that's a protestant
name, isn't it?

02:00.021 --> 02:03.657
Not a lot of protestants
in the IRA

02:03.725 --> 02:06.727
Or is that how you proved
you were a good fighter,

02:06.795 --> 02:10.030
defending your mother
for giving you that name?

02:13.201 --> 02:15.336
And what is it you do, Lauren?

02:15.404 --> 02:18.272
Right now I'm trying
to get into business

02:18.340 --> 02:19.940
with a former IRA Captain.

02:20.008 --> 02:22.576
He's gone freelance.
You might have heard of him.

02:22.644 --> 02:24.078
Valhalla.

02:27.716 --> 02:29.850
Yeah.

02:29.918 --> 02:32.052
I might know him.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.921
Well...

02:33.989 --> 02:37.491
Since this is sensitive...

02:37.559 --> 02:40.060
it might be better to
discuss this privately.

02:40.128 --> 02:50.032
- You're just full of surprises,
aren't you? - You have no idea.

02:50.705 --> 02:53.207
I said out!

02:53.275 --> 02:55.009
Get out of here, Fahey.

02:55.060 --> 02:56.811
Do you know who I am?

02:56.878 --> 02:59.079
I am the man.
I used to run this block.

02:59.147 --> 03:01.065
Now you're just a bum. Out!

03:01.149 --> 03:04.452
I got 4 names on the bottom
of the list prentiss gave us.

03:04.519 --> 03:05.986
Luke Renault,

03:06.054 --> 03:07.655
Lawrence Riley, Lila Rafferty,

03:07.722 --> 03:08.956
Lyle Rogers.

03:09.024 --> 03:10.558
All with the initials l.R.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.293
The CIA uses cryptograms
like that

03:12.360 --> 03:13.727
to assign to non-official
cover agents

03:13.795 --> 03:15.029
working the same case.

03:15.096 --> 03:16.497
So do other foreign countries.

03:16.565 --> 03:19.834
These last 4 names
are covers... spies.

03:19.901 --> 03:21.952
Wait.

03:22.037 --> 03:24.038
No. This isn't right.

03:24.105 --> 03:26.624
Do you see this space?
That shouldn't be here.

03:26.708 --> 03:27.975
Could it be a formatting error?

03:28.043 --> 03:29.176
No, this is
a spreadsheet template.

03:29.244 --> 03:30.911
Formatting
doesn't allow for this.

03:30.962 --> 03:32.213
There's a missing name on here.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.582
It's another spy
whose cover is l.R.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.951
Lauren Reynolds is dead.

03:37.018 --> 03:38.102
Lauren Reynolds is dead.

03:38.186 --> 03:41.138
Lauren Reynolds is dead.
What?

03:41.223 --> 03:42.523
"Lauren Reynolds is dead."

03:42.590 --> 03:45.109
Prentiss said that
on a phone call 17 days ago.

03:45.193 --> 03:46.660
But her intonation
wasn't surprise or grief.

03:46.728 --> 03:48.979
It was like a mantra,
like she was reminding herself.

03:49.064 --> 03:50.114
Lauren Reynolds, l.R.

03:50.198 --> 03:51.932
If prentiss is the last
name on that list,

03:52.000 --> 03:53.100
she's on Doyle's list, too.

03:53.151 --> 03:55.870
That explains
her behavior the past month.

03:55.937 --> 03:57.304
The secrets, the evasion.

03:57.372 --> 03:58.605
She's been biting
her fingernails again, too.

03:58.657 --> 04:01.208
Guys.

04:01.276 --> 04:03.711
She left her badge and gun?
Why would she do that?

04:03.778 --> 04:06.213
That doesn't make sense. Why run?
We're her family. We can help.

04:06.281 --> 04:08.449
Doyle's killing families.

04:08.517 --> 04:10.651
She's not married,
not close to relatives.

04:10.719 --> 04:11.802
He was ready to wipe us out.

04:11.887 --> 04:16.089
She ran to protect us.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.602
Battery's dead, Fahey.

04:28.653 --> 04:31.105
Jeez. Lauren.

04:31.172 --> 04:33.340
She's a trained spy.
She doesn't want to be found.

04:33.408 --> 04:36.410
She knows all of our tricks.
We don't know any of hers.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.745
All right, then
how do we find her?

04:37.812 --> 04:39.646
Here's how.
Ian Doyle is our unsub,

04:39.698 --> 04:41.115
prentiss is our victim.

04:41.166 --> 04:44.084
We profile their behavior and we
treat it like any other case.

04:44.152 --> 04:45.819
Because terrorism isn't
an area we specialize in,

04:45.887 --> 04:48.088
I've reached out to an expert
from the state department,

04:48.156 --> 04:50.491
someone who can also shed
light on prentiss' past.

04:50.559 --> 04:53.260
Who?
Her.

04:58.967 --> 05:00.834
Let's get to work.

05:00.902 --> 05:02.937
How many men
does Doyle have, Jack?

05:03.004 --> 05:05.272
Doyle? I haven't seen
that guy in a...

05:07.208 --> 05:09.109
15, maybe 20 guys.

05:09.177 --> 05:10.377
Any surprises?

05:10.445 --> 05:12.846
Just automatic weapons.
It's mostly local mob guys.

05:12.898 --> 05:14.615
There's a little bit
of IRA And...

05:14.683 --> 05:16.116
Lauren, how about
you do me a favor,

05:16.184 --> 05:18.152
huh, you ease up
on that gun, ok?

05:18.219 --> 05:19.703
I helped you and Clyde
back in the day.

05:19.788 --> 05:20.988
I can help you now.

05:21.056 --> 05:22.523
Do you want to know
where Doyle is?

05:22.591 --> 05:23.857
I already do.

05:23.925 --> 05:25.326
Yeah, but what are
you gonna do, huh,

05:25.393 --> 05:26.560
take him out on your own?

05:26.628 --> 05:29.530
What are you gonna do,
tell him?

05:29.598 --> 05:32.032
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

06:13.854 --> 06:15.838
Ok, so I talked to
a friend from Langley.

06:15.890 --> 06:18.358
He couldn't give me Emily's
full CIA history,

06:18.442 --> 06:19.842
but he could give me this.

06:19.894 --> 06:22.112
She assumed the identity
of Lauren Reynolds

06:22.179 --> 06:25.482
as part of a special
task force called JTF-12.

06:25.533 --> 06:26.816
I heard about them.

06:26.884 --> 06:28.351
They were profiling
terrorists, weren't they?

06:28.419 --> 06:30.186
Yeah, assembled after 9-11.

06:30.254 --> 06:33.423
CIA and Western agencies contributed
their best and brightest.

06:33.491 --> 06:34.658
But serial killers
and terrorists

06:34.709 --> 06:35.992
have different
personality traits.

06:36.060 --> 06:38.662
How does Doyle fit in?
He was their last case.

06:38.729 --> 06:41.131
And now the JTF
is on his hit list.

06:41.198 --> 06:43.633
Jeremy wolff
was victim number one,

06:43.701 --> 06:45.335
from Germany's BND.
Sean McAlister at interpol

06:45.403 --> 06:47.554
was the second.
He's the one

06:47.638 --> 06:49.439
that brought the JTF in
to work the Doyle case.

06:49.507 --> 06:51.174
He was murdered
last week in brussels

06:51.242 --> 06:52.942
with his wife and daughter.

06:53.010 --> 06:55.095
Tsia Mosely of France's DCRI.

06:55.179 --> 06:57.080
She got engaged to Jeremy
earlier this year.

06:57.148 --> 06:59.265
After he died,
she fled to D.C.

06:59.350 --> 07:02.352
And team leader
Clyde Easter, British s.I.S.

07:02.420 --> 07:04.387
He hasn't checked in
since Tsia's murder.

07:04.455 --> 07:05.588
He was also in D.C.

07:05.656 --> 07:07.757
Did JTF make the arrests?

07:07.825 --> 07:09.359
No, the host countries
handled that.

07:09.427 --> 07:10.660
The team moved on
to the next case.

07:10.728 --> 07:12.062
If all they did
was deliver a profile,

07:12.129 --> 07:13.930
how does Doyle
even know about them?

07:13.998 --> 07:16.032
Well, considering the shadowy
nature of terrorist cells,

07:16.100 --> 07:19.002
they utilize a skill
we don't... infiltration.

07:19.070 --> 07:21.171
Who was undercover on Doyle?

07:21.238 --> 07:23.707
Emily. She made contact
with him in Boston

07:23.774 --> 07:25.041
to get intel on Valhalla.

07:25.109 --> 07:27.510
She was posing
as another weapons dealer.

07:27.578 --> 07:29.012
Look at how she's dressed.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.680
She seems awfully comfortable.

07:30.748 --> 07:33.116
How close did she get
to Doyle as part of her cover?

07:33.184 --> 07:35.251
The recon they did
on Doyle included

07:35.319 --> 07:38.188
a background of all of
his romantic relationships.

07:38.255 --> 07:41.090
Emily was his type.

07:46.230 --> 07:49.566
She asked you
to stop here yesterday?

07:49.617 --> 07:51.101
Yeah.

07:51.168 --> 07:53.620
Change her boots and...

07:53.738 --> 07:56.406
Get whatever she needed,
I guess.

07:56.457 --> 07:58.608
It's never easy, you know,

07:58.676 --> 08:03.446
having to dig through
a friend's life.

08:03.514 --> 08:05.181
But that's not what's
bugging you, is it?

08:05.249 --> 08:07.350
You're angry

08:07.418 --> 08:10.470
because she crossed
the line with Doyle.

08:10.554 --> 08:11.755
No, I'm not.

08:11.822 --> 08:14.724
I'm angry because a group
of mercenaries

08:14.792 --> 08:15.842
just shot at me.

08:15.926 --> 08:18.528
I don't much like being
shot at, rossi.

08:18.596 --> 08:20.563
Prentiss knew exactly
what was going on,

08:20.631 --> 08:22.182
but she didn't bother
to tell any of us.

08:22.266 --> 08:24.484
She couldn't without
putting us at risk.

08:24.568 --> 08:25.985
Come on, man,
we don't know that.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.970
All we do know is that
she slept with a terrorist

08:28.022 --> 08:29.305
for a profile.

08:29.373 --> 08:31.541
And instead of coming clean
with us about her dirty laundry,

08:31.609 --> 08:32.642
she just ran with it.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.811
You think it's that simple?

08:34.879 --> 08:36.746
Till there's a reason not to.

08:37.981 --> 08:39.749
Well...

08:39.817 --> 08:41.818
Here's one.

08:41.869 --> 08:45.021
That's her passport,
the real one.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.923
Now, if you wanted to vanish,

08:46.991 --> 08:49.008
wouldn't you take
that with you?

08:50.878 --> 08:53.496
This doesn't mean anything.

08:53.547 --> 08:55.832
I worked with that woman
for 5 years.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.600
I put my life in her hands.

08:57.668 --> 08:59.335
I called her my friend.

08:59.403 --> 09:02.272
But right now I can't even say
that I ever really knew her.

09:02.339 --> 09:03.840
Can you?

09:05.376 --> 09:08.244
There's something down there.

09:14.785 --> 09:16.719
What do you got?

09:16.787 --> 09:19.789
It's called a Gimmel ring.

09:19.857 --> 09:22.792
The husband and wife-to-be
wear individual bands

09:22.860 --> 09:26.296
during the engagement
and at the wedding.

09:26.363 --> 09:28.398
You see the markings
in the middle? Gaelic.

09:28.466 --> 09:29.566
Doyle gave it to her.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.100
This ring is more
than just a souvenir.

09:31.202 --> 09:33.536
Otherwise, why hang on
to it all this time?

09:33.587 --> 09:34.871
Why hide it from us?

09:34.939 --> 09:36.473
What makes you think
she went to Boston?

09:36.540 --> 09:38.074
Well, the Doyle case
started in Boston.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.210
Maybe she's going back to old
locations trying to hunt him down.

09:40.277 --> 09:42.712
If he had us in his
crosshairs, she wouldn't run.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.347
She'd take the fight to him.

09:52.389 --> 09:56.826
Pack up this stuff.
I want to be out of here in 48 hours.

10:06.704 --> 10:08.037
Open it.

10:18.015 --> 10:19.549
Liam, something bothering you?

10:19.617 --> 10:23.686
None of our other suppliers
can get stuff this good.

10:23.754 --> 10:27.757
She's too good to be true,
and you're too blind to see it.

10:27.825 --> 10:30.059
Shut it.

10:31.662 --> 10:33.463
Get in the car,

10:33.531 --> 10:35.198
the second one.

10:37.868 --> 10:39.102
I'll take care of her.

10:39.169 --> 10:40.870
Right.

10:53.117 --> 10:56.553
You always ride
in the second car. Why?

10:56.620 --> 10:58.521
Because the first car

10:58.589 --> 11:00.957
takes the hit in an ambush.

11:01.025 --> 11:05.695
Are you going to...
Take care of me?

11:05.763 --> 11:08.331
Yes, I am.

11:10.401 --> 11:12.018
Good.

11:19.076 --> 11:20.376
Hey, hey.

11:20.444 --> 11:22.078
I need to ask you something.

11:23.614 --> 11:26.449
You never ask me about my,
you know, about my business,

11:26.517 --> 11:28.718
about Valhalla.

11:28.786 --> 11:31.254
Why is that?

11:31.322 --> 11:34.023
I just...

11:34.091 --> 11:38.261
Assume you'll tell me
when you're ready to tell me.

11:38.362 --> 11:40.029
Well, uh,

11:40.097 --> 11:42.699
there is something
I want to tell you.

11:45.369 --> 11:47.503
Ok.

11:50.724 --> 11:53.209
I was gonna get you
the ring, but, uh,

11:53.277 --> 11:57.714
you said you're not
the marrying type.

12:00.584 --> 12:01.751
It's...

12:01.819 --> 12:03.553
It's beautiful.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.658
Look at me.

12:08.726 --> 12:11.094
I am Valhalla.

12:13.197 --> 12:16.399
I have no idea what kind of
life we're gonna have, but...

12:16.467 --> 12:19.402
I just want you in mine.

12:32.383 --> 12:35.718
Sir, Tsia got a hit on one
of Clyde Easter's covers.

12:35.786 --> 12:37.220
He's on a plane to Boston
as we speak.

12:37.287 --> 12:39.188
Have him detained as soon as he steps off.
We need to go.

12:39.256 --> 12:41.724
Garcia, you're coming with us.
Ok, yes.

12:41.792 --> 12:44.410
Your government's
gonna hear about this.

12:44.495 --> 12:48.581
Will you call the British
consulate, please?

12:48.666 --> 12:50.083
British consulate, now!

12:50.167 --> 12:52.568
Step back, sir.

12:52.619 --> 12:56.039
You're being detained as a suspect
in a murder investigation.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.591
Wonderful.

13:15.225 --> 13:16.659
Hey, it's me.

13:16.727 --> 13:18.227
Hotch asked me
to try all your numbers,

13:18.295 --> 13:19.662
and I have this
as an old listing,

13:19.730 --> 13:21.264
and you probably
don't even use it anymore,

13:21.331 --> 13:23.299
but if it is you
and you're out there,

13:23.367 --> 13:26.669
come home, please.

13:26.737 --> 13:28.838
God, Emily, what did you think,

13:28.906 --> 13:30.907
that we would just let you
walk out of our lives?

13:30.974 --> 13:33.376
I am so furious
at you right now!

13:33.444 --> 13:35.712
Then I think about
how scared you must be,

13:35.779 --> 13:38.548
how you're in some
dark place all alone.

13:38.615 --> 13:40.717
But you're not alone, ok?
You are not alone.

13:40.784 --> 13:42.518
We are in that
dark place with you.

13:42.586 --> 13:44.520
We are waving flashlights
and calling your name.

13:44.588 --> 13:46.923
So if you can see us,
come home.

13:46.990 --> 13:50.093
If you can't, then...

13:50.160 --> 13:52.528
Then you stay alive.

13:52.596 --> 13:54.764
'Cause we're coming.

14:59.863 --> 15:01.964
I only want Doyle.
Where's Doyle?

15:02.032 --> 15:03.532
Right here, love.

15:05.102 --> 15:07.270
Right here.

15:13.877 --> 15:15.144
There it is.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.882
Hello, love.

15:23.593 --> 15:25.594
<i>Emily
walked into a trap.</i>

15:25.662 --> 15:27.496
It looks like Doyle
got into the SUV,

15:27.564 --> 15:30.132
but from this angle,
you can see that he didn't.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.635
Which I wish Boston PD Would have
told me before I started watching it.

15:33.703 --> 15:35.370
Sorry again for the screaming.

15:35.438 --> 15:38.273
She threw a flash-bang
grenade into a car.

15:38.341 --> 15:40.442
She's lucky the 3 people
inside didn't die.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.945
Is anybody else
bothered by that?

15:43.012 --> 15:44.112
Well, 3 bad guys.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.281
Illegal as it is,
I think prentiss knows

15:46.349 --> 15:47.883
she has to be
as ruthless as Doyle.

15:47.951 --> 15:50.385
He's come to the US
to wage a public vendetta

15:50.453 --> 15:52.721
and hired a group of mercenaries
to remain loyal to him.

15:52.789 --> 15:55.190
He has nothing to lose,
so she has to act the same way.

15:55.258 --> 15:58.126
So how did Doyle know
she was waiting for him?

15:58.194 --> 15:59.895
Well, the mole must
have told him, right?

15:59.963 --> 16:02.331
The same guy who's been feeding
Doyle the contractors and agents?

16:02.398 --> 16:06.134
And our best suspect was just arrested
with a suitcase full of cash.

16:06.202 --> 16:08.770
How do we get Easter to talk?
He won't cooperate willingly.

16:08.838 --> 16:12.007
I'll handle that.
The rest of you focus on Doyle's location.

16:12.075 --> 16:14.009
I hate to be the one
to ask this,

16:14.077 --> 16:16.378
but how long does Emily have?

16:17.814 --> 16:20.949
Her best chance
is also the most troubling.

16:21.017 --> 16:25.354
Doyle saved her for last because
he views her as his stressor.

16:25.421 --> 16:27.656
Which means
he'll take his time.

16:55.118 --> 16:57.252
Where's my ring?

16:59.289 --> 17:01.890
I flushed it.

17:04.394 --> 17:08.997
I spent 7 years in hell
because of that ring.

17:09.048 --> 17:13.969
So now I'm going
to give you another gift,

17:14.037 --> 17:17.306
one you won't
get rid of so easily.

17:22.712 --> 17:25.247
A four-leaf clover
should be a nice addition

17:25.315 --> 17:27.983
to your other tattoos.

17:29.319 --> 17:31.553
You still have two, right?

17:31.621 --> 17:33.989
Yep.

17:34.057 --> 17:36.091
And that's enough ink, thanks.

17:36.159 --> 17:39.745
Ink?

17:41.164 --> 17:43.231
North Koreans can't afford ink.

17:43.299 --> 17:46.068
No, no.
They brand themselves.

17:59.549 --> 18:02.718
The more you fight,
the more this will hurt.

18:06.956 --> 18:09.925
Get your hands off me!
Do you know who I am?

18:09.992 --> 18:11.727
I'm the man!

18:11.794 --> 18:12.728
Who's that?

18:12.795 --> 18:13.962
Jack Fahey,

18:14.030 --> 18:15.731
Irish mob. He called
Easter's cell phone

18:15.798 --> 18:17.232
12 times in 6 hours.

18:17.283 --> 18:18.700
Any connection to Doyle?

18:18.768 --> 18:20.235
Boston PD says he's low level.

18:20.286 --> 18:23.472
But the Irish mob has
long-standing ties to the IRA

18:23.539 --> 18:25.807
See if you can get
anything out of him.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.409
Why are you doing this?

18:27.477 --> 18:29.611
Why are you keeping me alive?

18:29.662 --> 18:32.214
Hey.
FBI grabbed Fahey.

18:32.281 --> 18:35.717
Her people. It won't be long
before he starts squealing

18:35.785 --> 18:37.502
and they're banging
on our door.

18:41.023 --> 18:44.826
Do what you have to so we
get the hell out of here.

18:47.296 --> 18:49.664
I know what you want.

18:49.732 --> 18:52.234
Do you, really?

18:52.301 --> 18:54.336
You want Lauren Reynolds back.

18:54.404 --> 18:57.739
I can do that.
I can be her.

18:57.807 --> 19:00.542
You think that'll
save your skin?

19:00.610 --> 19:03.378
I have no illusions.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.047
But I'm tired of this.

19:06.115 --> 19:07.816
Of being afraid.

19:07.884 --> 19:10.419
We don't have time for this.

19:10.486 --> 19:11.953
We'll make time.

19:12.021 --> 19:13.221
What about Fahey?

19:13.289 --> 19:15.390
I'll take care of Fahey.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.460
He smokes, right?

19:18.528 --> 19:19.661
Aye.

19:21.030 --> 19:23.732
Looks like you earned
yourself a reprieve.

19:27.553 --> 19:29.571
October 2006.

19:29.639 --> 19:32.808
"In closing, I have never worked with
a finer agent than Emily prentiss.

19:32.875 --> 19:37.512
Her skill at analyzing and predicting
terrorist behavior is unparalleled."

19:37.580 --> 19:39.247
Signed, name redacted.

19:39.315 --> 19:41.116
You used all
the right buzzwords,

19:41.184 --> 19:42.951
told us everything
we wanted to hear.

19:43.019 --> 19:45.086
You sold her to us the
same way you sold Doyle

19:45.154 --> 19:47.422
to the north Koreans.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.591
Just because you know
how I profile

19:49.659 --> 19:52.494
doesn't mean you know me.

19:52.562 --> 19:56.131
It takes a skilled
sociopath to betray his team

19:56.199 --> 19:58.967
and the cause he held dear
for self-preservation.

19:59.035 --> 20:01.603
If you cooperate with us
and we save agent prentiss,

20:01.671 --> 20:04.206
then maybe we could
talk about a deal.

20:04.273 --> 20:06.608
But if anything happens to
her, I will destroy you.

20:06.676 --> 20:08.543
You can count on that.

20:09.912 --> 20:13.281
She said you were the best.

20:13.349 --> 20:16.151
I'm unimpressed.

20:16.219 --> 20:18.553
We'll get Doyle
with or without you.

20:18.621 --> 20:20.856
Pack lightly.
Guantanamo gets humid.

20:20.923 --> 20:23.625
Nice try.

20:23.693 --> 20:26.161
Oh, but... but I'm curious...

20:26.229 --> 20:29.231
If I'm a sociopath,

20:29.298 --> 20:31.867
I should feel no empathy,
correct?

20:31.934 --> 20:33.735
You're not the sociopath.

20:33.803 --> 20:35.737
Doyle is.

20:35.805 --> 20:39.107
I thought you were
a better profiler.

20:40.309 --> 20:43.211
Why were you calling Clyde
Easter so much, Jack?

20:43.279 --> 20:45.881
Anybody got a smoke?

20:45.948 --> 20:48.016
How about you, beanpole?

20:48.084 --> 20:50.385
What do you think?

20:50.453 --> 20:52.888
Narcissism masking
deep-seated insecurity.

20:52.955 --> 20:54.523
So if we puncture
his self-image,

20:54.590 --> 20:56.925
this hood rat will talk.

20:56.993 --> 20:59.961
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't no hood rat.
You take that back.

21:00.029 --> 21:03.398
Well, you look like one.
You smell like one. You smell that?

21:03.466 --> 21:05.433
Hood rat.
I am not!

21:05.501 --> 21:06.601
Take it back!

21:06.669 --> 21:08.103
Hey, Jack.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.672
Do you know what a hood rat is?

21:10.740 --> 21:13.575
You see what I mean?

21:13.643 --> 21:16.294
He's just gonna have
to learn the hard way.

21:16.379 --> 21:18.547
All right, all right, look, Clyde
was gonna pay my medical bills,

21:18.614 --> 21:20.582
all right? This ear,
it ain't growing back.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.684
What happened to it?

21:22.752 --> 21:25.353
This bitch teammate of his shot it.
Said it was a warning.

21:25.421 --> 21:27.973
Thought she could take on this
IRA Big shot named Doyle.

21:28.057 --> 21:29.257
So I told these... aah!

21:29.308 --> 21:30.625
What the hell, man?! Jeez!

21:30.676 --> 21:32.327
Where's prentiss?

21:32.395 --> 21:33.461
Who? I don't know!

21:33.512 --> 21:35.897
Lauren Reynolds.
Where is Lauren Reynolds?

21:39.302 --> 21:41.436
Friend of yours, is she?

21:41.487 --> 21:43.772
You tell us where
she is right now,

21:43.823 --> 21:45.540
or I swear, I'll
send you to a prison

21:45.608 --> 21:47.909
where they'll teach you
what a hood rat is.

21:47.977 --> 21:50.278
And by the time you do,

21:50.346 --> 21:51.780
she'll be in pieces.

21:51.847 --> 21:53.181
So, uh...

21:53.249 --> 21:55.383
My price just went up.

21:59.422 --> 22:01.423
200,000?

22:01.490 --> 22:03.158
What other leverage do we have?

22:03.225 --> 22:04.492
Is he an addict?

22:04.560 --> 22:06.428
He's having a nicotine fit.

22:06.495 --> 22:08.597
We wouldn't let him smoke.

22:08.664 --> 22:11.199
We could use that.
He'd relax, open his big mouth.

22:11.267 --> 22:13.001
Is that enough?

22:13.052 --> 22:16.204
Well, I'm pretty good
with narcissists.

22:16.305 --> 22:18.406
Dated a few.

22:31.287 --> 22:34.089
And what is it you do...

22:34.156 --> 22:36.491
Lauren?

22:40.396 --> 22:42.664
I'm looking to get
into business

22:42.732 --> 22:44.399
with a former IRA Captain

22:44.467 --> 22:46.901
who's gone freelance.

22:46.969 --> 22:49.404
Valhalla.

22:49.472 --> 22:54.075
But since this is sensitive...

22:54.143 --> 22:56.845
It might be better to discuss
this privately.

22:57.980 --> 23:02.350
You're just full of
surprises, aren't you?

23:06.789 --> 23:08.857
Let me out of these.

23:08.924 --> 23:11.760
That's not how it went.

23:14.556 --> 23:17.498
I can't make you
happy in handcuffs.

23:24.740 --> 23:27.709
You really think I'd
let you fool me twice?

23:27.777 --> 23:29.044
I just wanted...

23:29.111 --> 23:30.612
I know what you wanted...

23:30.680 --> 23:32.347
a way into my head.

23:32.415 --> 23:34.382
But I changed the locks.

23:34.450 --> 23:37.318
So you're going to suffer
the way I suffered.

23:37.386 --> 23:40.021
This won't be the first time
you've killed an innocent,

23:40.122 --> 23:44.442
but it will be the first
time you have to watch.

23:44.527 --> 23:46.561
Liam!

23:50.266 --> 23:52.734
You know when
a cigarette is best?

23:52.785 --> 23:54.402
After sex with me.

23:54.470 --> 23:55.787
Mind your manners.

23:55.871 --> 23:57.455
All right. Whoa, whoa.

23:57.540 --> 24:00.909
You're already extorting
us for prentiss' location.

24:00.976 --> 24:03.128
So, just out of curiosity,

24:03.212 --> 24:06.214
what's it like
working for Doyle?

24:06.281 --> 24:09.184
Eh, he's not so tough.

24:16.025 --> 24:17.192
You got him?

24:17.259 --> 24:18.760
Acquiring.

24:18.828 --> 24:21.362
- Which one's the target?
- No!

24:21.430 --> 24:22.931
This was about you and me!

24:22.982 --> 24:24.699
That's what you said!
You and me!

24:24.767 --> 24:26.101
Then why is your team here?

24:26.168 --> 24:28.436
'Cause I didn't leave a trail.

24:28.487 --> 24:30.572
Ian...

24:30.639 --> 24:32.040
Whatever you want
to do to me, I accept,

24:32.108 --> 24:33.975
but leave them out of it.

24:34.043 --> 24:36.745
Yes, except I didn't bring
them into it, did I?

24:36.812 --> 24:39.447
What are you thinking?

24:39.515 --> 24:42.751
Woman first,
then the goateed fella.

24:42.818 --> 24:46.221
And then Fahey if he has a shot.
If not, he'll shut up.

24:46.288 --> 24:48.223
Yeah. Sounds
about right.

24:48.290 --> 24:50.692
Shoot Fahey.

24:50.760 --> 24:54.329
If he dies, my team
doesn't have anything.

24:59.135 --> 25:00.935
Hello, Lauren.

25:01.003 --> 25:03.938
Good to see you again.

25:04.006 --> 25:07.675
Wow.
I bet you're his hookup, aren't you?

25:07.743 --> 25:11.179
I mean, after all,
you're the man.

25:11.247 --> 25:13.515
I could show you how much
of a man I really am.

25:13.582 --> 25:15.200
All right, all right,
all right, jeez.

25:15.284 --> 25:16.951
What's with the sexy cop/
bad cop routine?

25:17.019 --> 25:20.038
What do you two think...

25:21.690 --> 25:23.374
Down!

25:39.580 --> 25:40.931
That's not going to come out.

25:40.998 --> 25:43.400
Yeah, I know.

25:43.468 --> 25:46.303
Ashley, we have a problem.

25:46.370 --> 25:49.706
Without Fahey,
there's not much left.

25:49.774 --> 25:51.208
We all want to save
prentiss so bad

25:51.275 --> 25:53.043
that we can't see
this case straight.

25:53.111 --> 25:55.745
Ok. What do we do?

25:55.813 --> 25:58.715
We depend on the team member
with the freshest eyes.

25:58.783 --> 26:00.801
Oh, no. Not me, no.

26:00.885 --> 26:02.385
You haven't worked
with prentiss

26:02.453 --> 26:04.121
for 5 years.
You're unprejudiced.

26:04.188 --> 26:08.291
Now, what's been bugging you
since we left Quantico?

26:08.359 --> 26:10.293
How about the affair?

26:10.361 --> 26:12.362
That bugs me.

26:12.429 --> 26:15.482
How does the two of them sleeping
together change Doyle's profile?

26:15.566 --> 26:17.317
I don't know.
Come on, Ashley.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.535
It's textbook.

26:18.602 --> 26:20.303
I haven't read every textbook.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.873
You want me to hold your hand?
Fine. What doesn't fit?

26:22.940 --> 26:24.107
Just say it!

26:24.175 --> 26:26.442
What are you thinking?
Spit it out!

26:26.494 --> 26:28.512
Why families?
Keep going.

26:28.579 --> 26:30.447
Prentiss is Doyle's stressor.

26:30.515 --> 26:32.115
He wants revenge on
the woman who betrayed him,

26:32.183 --> 26:33.550
and I understand that.

26:33.618 --> 26:37.254
But why kill
that child in D.C.?

26:37.305 --> 26:41.525
That's the agent seaver
I'm looking for.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.028
Come on.

26:45.096 --> 26:46.596
Let's get you a new shirt.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.799
So, assuming
Clyde isn't the mole,

26:49.867 --> 26:51.768
we looked through the JTF's
personal records again,

26:51.819 --> 26:54.354
and Jeremy made some fancy
plans before his death.

26:54.438 --> 26:57.807
Specifically, he bought
a large estate in Spain...

26:57.859 --> 27:00.010
He signed all the documents
with one of his covers.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.412
Made a down payment in cash,
deposited the rest.

27:02.479 --> 27:04.314
So Jeremy sold
the list to Doyle.

27:04.382 --> 27:07.050
He was the first victim,
killed quietly.

27:07.118 --> 27:08.785
Doyle didn't want any
attention until he was ready.

27:08.853 --> 27:09.986
Did tsia know?

27:10.054 --> 27:11.254
I can't tell.

27:11.322 --> 27:13.823
If I were running
from a terrorist,

27:13.875 --> 27:16.860
I would cash in my IRA Not that one.
The other... you know what I mean.

27:16.928 --> 27:19.062
My point is, tsia didn't
touch that money,

27:19.130 --> 27:21.565
so I don't think
she's in on it.

27:21.632 --> 27:23.900
Did you know that Jeremy
sold the list to Doyle?

27:23.968 --> 27:25.702
I had my suspicions.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.538
So when you got to D.C.
, you couldn't trust tsia, either.

27:28.606 --> 27:31.174
Prentiss read your doubt
as duplicity and so did we.

27:31.242 --> 27:33.543
Well, you could have just asked
me who Doyle's plant was.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.011
Would you have told me?

27:35.079 --> 27:37.547
No.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.216
Someone we both care
about is in trouble.

27:39.283 --> 27:42.018
I need the original profile
when Doyle was a terrorist.

27:42.086 --> 27:44.821
We combine that with who he
is now as a serial killer.

27:44.889 --> 27:46.489
Agent Hotchner,
you took an oath

27:46.557 --> 27:48.291
to protect the laws
of your country,

27:48.359 --> 27:51.895
and I took one to protect
the secrets of mine.

27:51.963 --> 27:53.797
Do you understand
what you're asking?

27:53.864 --> 27:55.699
I know it's not easy.

27:55.766 --> 27:58.602
I'll do it.
If you join me.

27:58.669 --> 28:02.105
You see, there's no
catching that man.

28:02.173 --> 28:04.708
He'd escape from your prison
as easily as he did north Korea.

28:04.775 --> 28:08.278
And then,
all hell breaks loose.

28:08.346 --> 28:10.714
If you want to stop that man,

28:10.781 --> 28:13.016
you have to put a bullet
between his eyes yourself.

28:13.084 --> 28:15.518
Can you do that?

28:15.586 --> 28:20.257
Can you break your oath,
agent Hotchner?

28:20.324 --> 28:22.759
No.

28:22.827 --> 28:26.062
Can you take one, then?

28:26.130 --> 28:27.964
Can you swear

28:28.032 --> 28:30.433
that your team will save her?

28:30.501 --> 28:32.636
Yes.

28:36.958 --> 28:40.243
The British consul's here.

28:40.311 --> 28:42.612
Could you tell him
I'll be right out?

28:42.680 --> 28:46.783
I'm consulting
with the BAU on a case.

28:48.085 --> 28:51.054
Ian Doyle's a
power-assertive psychopath,

28:51.122 --> 28:52.772
highly controlling
and very explosive

28:52.857 --> 28:54.608
when something
doesn't go as planned.

28:54.692 --> 28:57.611
Ok, so how does this fit in with
who he is as a family annihilator?

28:57.695 --> 28:59.763
And prentiss' role in it.

28:59.830 --> 29:01.898
Annihilators have a romanticized
view of who their family is.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.033
Well, actually,
he was an orphan.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.068
Well, they think of family
as their possession,

29:05.136 --> 29:07.237
until some law shatters that
and starts them killing.

29:07.305 --> 29:09.439
- But Doyle was never married.
- Children?

29:09.507 --> 29:10.657
No.
You run your profile

29:10.741 --> 29:12.008
that he carried out his murders

29:12.076 --> 29:13.209
with surgical-like precision.
Yes.

29:13.277 --> 29:15.078
With no collateral damage.
That's right.

29:15.146 --> 29:18.281
Perhaps this child was a
surrogate for one he had.

29:18.349 --> 29:20.300
Say Doyle had a child
and you didn't know about it.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.152
Is it possible
that prentiss did?

29:22.219 --> 29:23.653
Then why would she
keep it from me?

29:23.721 --> 29:25.121
Who else was in the compound

29:25.189 --> 29:26.489
the day that you
arrested Doyle?

29:26.557 --> 29:27.657
Just his staff.
All Irish?

29:27.725 --> 29:30.126
Yeah.
That's a start.

29:30.177 --> 29:32.529
When Fahey told me
you were in the city,

29:32.596 --> 29:36.299
he said you already
knew where I was.

29:36.350 --> 29:37.467
If that's the truth,

29:37.535 --> 29:40.570
you know what this is about.

29:40.638 --> 29:42.572
Game's over, love.

29:42.639 --> 29:45.025
Time for your last confession.

29:48.012 --> 29:50.680
Take me to where he died.

29:50.781 --> 29:53.183
I want to see it.

30:14.905 --> 30:17.707
Breathe, just breathe.

30:17.775 --> 30:22.212
4, 5, 6...

30:22.279 --> 30:24.197
7, 8,

30:24.281 --> 30:27.384
9, 10.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.653
Ready or not, here I come!

30:30.721 --> 30:33.523
Aww, I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!

30:33.574 --> 30:35.225
I don't see you.
I don't see you.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.361
Aah! I'm gonna get you!

30:40.297 --> 30:42.749
Hi.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.704
Louise.

30:48.756 --> 30:50.306
Come take your boy, please.

31:02.803 --> 31:04.354
You ever think about that?

31:04.422 --> 31:07.557
Having kids?

31:07.625 --> 31:10.493
Be a little hard with what
we do, don't you think?

31:10.561 --> 31:13.463
Maybe you need the right
man to do it with.

31:13.531 --> 31:16.332
And a son who's
crazy about you.

31:18.035 --> 31:20.537
I...I thought

31:20.604 --> 31:23.807
he was your housekeeper's.

31:25.409 --> 31:28.945
Louise raises Declan so no
one can use him against me.

31:29.013 --> 31:30.680
But he's mine.

31:30.748 --> 31:33.249
And he needs a mother.

31:34.985 --> 31:37.654
I can't do that.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.923
Not here.

31:39.990 --> 31:43.493
Then I'll get you out.

31:43.561 --> 31:45.328
Or...

31:45.396 --> 31:47.831
I could get you out.

31:47.898 --> 31:50.266
I have resources.

31:50.334 --> 31:52.669
Contacts. He would be safer.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.604
And he'd have a father.

31:54.672 --> 31:56.840
You know what I am, Lauren.

31:56.907 --> 31:59.242
A warrior.

31:59.310 --> 32:01.110
I lead warriors.

32:01.178 --> 32:03.513
I raise warriors.

32:03.581 --> 32:05.648
I can't just leave.

32:08.919 --> 32:12.555
You want me to raise your son

32:12.623 --> 32:15.158
so he can have your life?

32:15.226 --> 32:18.027
Is it that bad a life?

32:18.095 --> 32:21.931
There are so many things

32:21.999 --> 32:26.486
I would do to make you happy.

32:35.546 --> 32:37.163
But...

32:37.248 --> 32:39.833
I can't do this.

32:39.917 --> 32:42.519
Go to your father.

32:57.668 --> 33:00.370
"Go to your father."
That's what you said.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.188
I never told anyone
the truth about Declan.

33:02.273 --> 33:03.473
You were the only one.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.341
And you put him in your
profile, didn't you?

33:05.392 --> 33:06.392
Yes.

33:06.477 --> 33:08.511
For 2 years, I didn't talk.

33:08.579 --> 33:11.848
The north Koreans used everything
you gave them against me.

33:11.916 --> 33:15.318
It wasn't until
they showed me these...

33:18.522 --> 33:20.523
They laughed at me as I wept.

33:20.574 --> 33:22.926
And you caused all
of this, didn't you?

33:22.993 --> 33:24.627
Yes, I did.

33:24.695 --> 33:29.699
That corner right there,
that's where he died.

33:29.767 --> 33:33.069
And that's where
I'm going to kill you.

33:39.143 --> 33:40.977
There's something
you don't know

33:41.045 --> 33:43.563
about those photos.

33:44.715 --> 33:47.116
I got him! I matched
Irish immigration records

33:47.184 --> 33:49.586
based on Doyle's employees.
Declan Jones,

33:49.653 --> 33:50.753
he's the only boy who matches.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.522
He settled in Boston
8 years ago,

33:52.590 --> 33:54.440
adoptive guardian Louise Jones.

33:54.525 --> 33:56.726
I knew Louise Jones.
She was Doyle's housekeeper.

33:56.794 --> 33:57.727
Are they still alive?

33:57.795 --> 33:59.412
Declan and his mother
went missing

33:59.480 --> 34:00.947
7 years ago.

34:01.031 --> 34:05.535
Bodies were never found.
Wait, what is this? Uh...

34:05.586 --> 34:08.237
God, someone took pictures
of them being shot.

34:08.304 --> 34:09.871
Is there an address?

34:09.924 --> 34:12.241
That looks like a warehouse.

34:12.309 --> 34:14.610
It's gotta be big enough to house a small army.
That's weapons, supplies.

34:14.678 --> 34:17.964
Let's see... which means
it has its own perimeter.

34:18.047 --> 34:20.216
I got it, 1518 Adams street.

34:20.284 --> 34:23.219
After your arrest, I relocated

34:23.286 --> 34:24.954
Louise and Declan.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.456
And then I got a call.

34:27.524 --> 34:32.395
Interpol had sent back
our profile.

34:32.463 --> 34:34.797
The head of
the terrorism division

34:34.864 --> 34:37.300
wanted more dirt on you
so they could break you.

34:37.368 --> 34:40.603
So you used my son
as a promotion.

34:40.654 --> 34:42.170
No.

34:42.239 --> 34:45.108
I wouldn't let him be a pawn.

34:45.175 --> 34:47.043
The things they would
have done to him

34:47.110 --> 34:50.013
to get you to talk...

34:50.080 --> 34:51.331
But I knew,

34:51.415 --> 34:53.166
even if I didn't cooperate,

34:53.250 --> 34:57.687
they were going to
find him eventually.

34:57.755 --> 34:59.088
So I had to...

34:59.139 --> 35:01.257
had to what?!

35:01.325 --> 35:03.993
I had to end his suffering

35:04.061 --> 35:06.679
before it could begin.

35:06.764 --> 35:09.332
Wait, wait, look at that.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.833
Morgan, come look at this.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.151
What did you do?
Uhh!

35:12.236 --> 35:14.804
You put him in the profile.
What else did you do?

35:14.872 --> 35:17.006
I put him in the profile

35:17.074 --> 35:19.008
after the pictures were taken.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.177
It's black clothing
and a hand, reid.

35:21.245 --> 35:24.714
No, look at the fingernails.

35:24.782 --> 35:26.032
Oh, my God!

35:26.116 --> 35:27.650
You don't know when
those pictures were taken.

35:27.718 --> 35:28.951
You don't know that.

35:29.019 --> 35:31.020
Yes, I do.

35:31.088 --> 35:34.157
I'm the one holding the gun.

35:44.562 --> 35:48.898
You want to hear
his lasts words to me?

35:52.620 --> 35:54.404
He said,

35:54.471 --> 35:58.675
"I looked pretty good
for a dead kid, didn't I?"

35:58.742 --> 36:01.411
And then he got on the plane

36:01.478 --> 36:03.346
and I never saw him again.

36:03.414 --> 36:06.182
He's alive?!

36:06.250 --> 36:09.502
Just because I held
a gun to him

36:09.587 --> 36:11.354
doesn't mean I shot him.

36:11.422 --> 36:13.690
I only had to make you
and the north Koreans

36:13.757 --> 36:15.658
believe he was dead.

36:19.096 --> 36:22.148
Agent prentiss is the
only friendly in the building.

36:22.232 --> 36:24.267
Rescuing her
is our primary objective.

36:24.318 --> 36:26.502
Our only advantage here
is stealth.

36:26.570 --> 36:27.737
Once they know we're on site,

36:27.805 --> 36:30.239
there's nothing to stop them
from killing her.

36:32.509 --> 36:36.829
So we keep it quiet
until we get to her.

36:36.914 --> 36:38.814
I know you're lying!

36:51.462 --> 36:53.379
I beat you, Ian...

36:53.464 --> 36:56.332
Before you even
got out of north Korea.

36:56.383 --> 36:57.767
I beat you.

36:57.834 --> 36:59.902
'Cause I gave Declan
his life back.

36:59.970 --> 37:01.604
I'll find him.

37:01.672 --> 37:03.056
No, you won't.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.891
Ever since you told me
my people had Fahey,

37:04.975 --> 37:06.876
I've been stalling you.

37:06.944 --> 37:08.111
Cut the power.

37:30.718 --> 37:34.904
Where is he?
Where's Declan, Emily?

37:34.972 --> 37:37.206
Tell me. Tell me.

37:39.677 --> 37:41.277
Where is he?

37:41.345 --> 37:44.213
Emily, tell me where he is.

37:44.281 --> 37:46.382
No.

38:04.168 --> 38:06.569
I got her!

38:06.637 --> 38:09.272
I got her in the basement on the South side.
I need a medic.

38:09.339 --> 38:10.606
Prentiss.

38:10.674 --> 38:11.941
Derek...

38:12.009 --> 38:13.309
Hey, it's me, I'm right here.

38:13.377 --> 38:15.445
You're gonna be all right.

38:15.512 --> 38:16.713
Stay with me, baby.
Come on, stay with me.

38:16.780 --> 38:18.514
Let me go.

38:18.582 --> 38:20.283
No, no. I am not
letting you go.

38:20.350 --> 38:22.251
Help me!

38:22.319 --> 38:24.587
Listen to me, I know why
you did all of this.

38:24.655 --> 38:27.090
I know what you did for Declan.

38:27.157 --> 38:29.425
I'm so proud of you.

38:29.493 --> 38:30.693
Do you understand that?

38:30.761 --> 38:32.729
I am proud of you
because you are my friend,

38:32.796 --> 38:35.264
and you are my partner.
No, Emily!

38:35.332 --> 38:36.432
Come on, stay with me.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.836
If you can hear me,
please just squeeze my hand.

38:39.903 --> 38:42.638
Yes, there you go. There you go, baby.
Just keep squeezing.

39:21.645 --> 39:23.146
No.

39:23.213 --> 39:25.948
She never made it
off the table.

39:33.423 --> 39:35.324
Spence.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.994
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

39:38.061 --> 39:40.329
Come here.

42:36.523 --> 42:38.741
Passports from
3 different countries,

42:38.809 --> 42:42.061
and a bank account in each
one to keep you comfortable.

42:45.282 --> 42:47.350
Thank you.

42:47.417 --> 42:48.751
Good luck.
