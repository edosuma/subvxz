00:25.558 --> 00:27.560
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

00:34.968 --> 00:38.405
Janet? Katy?

00:41.741 --> 00:44.744
He's big, huh?
He's very gentle.

00:48.181 --> 00:51.251
- Hey, guys.
- Look how cute. Oh.

00:51.286 --> 00:53.718
Daddy,
can we get a dog?

00:53.753 --> 00:55.720
Honey, I don't know. Oh, please.

00:55.755 --> 00:58.525
I'll take care of him.
We'll talk about it.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.197
Are you retarded? I was going
to the N.A. meetings and I just--

01:05.233 --> 01:08.101
I got caught up in the whole
making amends thingy, all right?

01:08.601 --> 01:10.603
It's not a thingy, Sean!
It's a step!

01:10.970 --> 01:13.773
And you're supposed to make amends for
your own personal bullshit, not mine!

01:14.007 --> 01:16.876
You know, telling Laura I was banging
the nurse, while stupid, was one thing.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.545
Telling the entire crew
that I was banging Laura--

01:19.580 --> 01:21.932
Sean, that's like a whole
new level of retardation.

01:21.967 --> 01:24.284
That's like the Special
Olympics of substance abuse.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.786
Well, I was drunk, Franco.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.624
Oh.

01:38.898 --> 01:42.902
Excuse me. Um, is Mike
Silletti around and about?

01:43.169 --> 01:46.104
Around and about? No.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.408
- You two familiar?
- Sure are.

01:50.743 --> 01:52.745
You mind if I ask how, uh--
how you two came to--

01:53.213 --> 01:55.081
Steven's birthday party.

01:55.381 --> 02:00.153
- Ah.
- Will you tell little Mikey that hairy John stopped by?

02:00.520 --> 02:03.172
Yeah, sure.
I'll tell little Mikey.

02:03.207 --> 02:06.401
Okay. You won't forget? Oh, no.

02:06.436 --> 02:09.596
- Toodles.
Toodles.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.063
Oh, my God.

02:12.098 --> 02:14.934
This is the outfit I was gonna
wear to work this afternoon.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.170
She read my mind.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.637
All right, here you go. Contest.

02:19.672 --> 02:22.175
Which one's gayer?
The dog or the dog walker?

02:23.676 --> 02:26.144
Well, well, well.

02:26.179 --> 02:29.182
- Hey, hey. How'd you make out, guys?
- It was great.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.535
-Did you have fun? Huh?
- Give me that lollipop.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.853
Hey. That's for the kids.
I'll see you later.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.856
Okay, come on, you guys.
Yeah, come on. Come on.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.376
Don't touch
that lollipop, Teddy.

02:39.411 --> 02:41.861
I touched it already.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.865
All right, here's the deal. If you leave the
apartment with the kids when I'm not around,

02:45.900 --> 02:48.368
you gotta take Teddy or Dad with
you, all right? I know. I know.

02:48.403 --> 02:50.870
See you later.
Okay. Bye.

03:09.622 --> 03:12.290
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

03:12.325 --> 03:15.728
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

03:16.129 --> 03:18.863
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

03:18.898 --> 03:21.866
Things were good
when we were young

03:21.901 --> 03:25.238
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

03:25.273 --> 03:28.575
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

03:28.610 --> 03:32.043
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

03:32.078 --> 03:35.164
Things were good
when we were young

03:35.199 --> 03:38.216
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

03:38.251 --> 03:41.437
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

03:41.472 --> 03:44.866
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

03:44.901 --> 03:48.261
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

03:51.931 --> 03:53.565
Hey. Hey. You still hungover?

03:53.600 --> 03:56.519
No, God, no.
That was like a week ago.

03:56.554 --> 03:59.404
Uh, well, yeah, a
little bit. Listen. No.

03:59.439 --> 04:01.406
I want to explain. Seriously.
Look. Please. I was wrong. No.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.944
You were wrong? Franco didn't sleep with
the nurse? No. He slept with the nurse.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.947
I don't wanna hear anymore. No, that's
not what I meant. I want to explain.

04:07.982 --> 04:11.416
The truth is, Laura, I just--
I was-- I was jealous, okay?

04:11.451 --> 04:15.455
I was jealous, I guess, because you
and I had this-- We had that thingy.

04:15.490 --> 04:18.976
We flirted and we were going
to go on a date and we didn't.

04:19.011 --> 04:22.462
How is that a thing?
When you put it that way.

04:22.497 --> 04:24.929
What way? Uh,
just-- The point is,

04:24.964 --> 04:27.634
the nurse was just about
getting the pills.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.101
It was about the pills.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.272
Really? Yeah. I mean, he was
addicted. Come on. Think about it.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.976
Oh, shit, Sean. What if I
overreacted? This is what I'm saying.

04:36.011 --> 04:38.610
Oh, shit. I mean, the nurse she
was, like, totally meaningless.

04:38.645 --> 04:41.314
It was like nothing. It was nothing.
It was nothing like the waitress.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.983
I mean, the nurse didn't even have
his home phone number. What waitress?

04:44.018 --> 04:46.951
Huh?
You said waitress.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.787
No. No, no, no. You said
nothing like the waitress.

04:49.822 --> 04:52.123
I meant the nurse. I was talking
about the nurse. You said--

04:52.158 --> 04:57.664
And the pills. Really, it was the
pills. He was-- What waitress, Sean?

04:57.699 --> 05:00.166
Can we, um, talk about
something else?

05:02.168 --> 05:06.304
Engine.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.640
Everything okay up there? Oh, yeah.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.677
Big fat dead guy in
the bathtub. How fat?

05:10.712 --> 05:12.644
Oh, Kirstie Alley,
Fat Actress,fat.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.246
- Elvis-at-the-end
fat. That fat. - Jesus.

05:15.281 --> 05:18.184
Yeah. He's been dead since yesterday
afternoon. He left the water running.

05:18.219 --> 05:19.984
Yeah, flooded out three floors. Suicide?

05:20.019 --> 05:21.819
Well, let me put it
this way. The note said,

05:21.854 --> 05:24.857
"Tell my wife I hope she's happy
now." Yeah. God knows he is.

05:25.224 --> 05:27.694
So? We turned off the faucet.
Told the super to call the cops.

05:27.729 --> 05:29.661
- Our job here is done.
- You know what?

05:29.696 --> 05:33.032
They wanna run point on the next terrorist
attack? Let 'em start with the big fat dead guy.

05:37.036 --> 05:41.040
Son of a bitch.

05:41.441 --> 05:45.176
You told Laura about the
waitress? No. No. Of course not.

05:45.211 --> 05:48.047
I mean, yes, but it was an accident,
all right? It just slipped out. Jesus.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.984
You realize what you done to me
here? I'm in love with her, Sean.

05:51.019 --> 05:53.886
You ever hear me say that about
a woman before? Huh? No. No.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.354
You're goddamn right, no.
Jesus.

05:56.389 --> 05:59.392
Keep your foolish face
out of my goddamn business.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.894
Wow. Love hurts.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.863
Love hurts.

06:05.898 --> 06:08.401
Hey, can I ask you something? Yeah.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.237
- It's Janet.
- Here we go.

06:11.604 --> 06:15.074
First week or so she was cold as ice, but the
last couple days she's been laughing at my jokes.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.542
She's been smiling, happy, seems
kind of content. Wait, wait, wait.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.246
- She took the kids to the museum the other day.
- She's laughing at jokes?

06:20.613 --> 06:22.582
Yeah. She bought me this
coffee-table book last night--

06:22.815 --> 06:25.184
You know what? She's either the world's
greatest actress, or she's on drugs.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.921
- I can't be funny?
- Not to her. Not in years.

06:29.288 --> 06:32.258
Unless, of course, it's a brain
tumor. But you wanna know something?

06:32.293 --> 06:34.260
With all that's gone down
over the last five years--

06:34.295 --> 06:36.429
let alone the whole
Sheila incident-- Yeah.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.264
for her to be laughin'
at your jokes, Mm-hmm.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.033
- gotta be a tumor the size of a grapefruit.
- I don't think it's a tumor.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.869
- Then we have option number three.
- Which is what?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.669
- Goofballs.
- Goofballs?

06:44.704 --> 06:46.671
Pills. They got pills
for everything now.

06:46.706 --> 06:50.777
Stop smoking, pay attention, don't worry.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

06:50.812 --> 06:54.614
I'd bet my right nut she's
on one of those brand-new...

06:55.014 --> 06:56.949
"I hate my husband. I hate
my life. My vagina hurts.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.750
Please, just take it all away"
kind of thing.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.871
- They got those now?
- Take two a day and your asshole husband...

07:01.906 --> 07:04.957
is not only all of a sudden funny,
but you might just want to bang...

07:05.458 --> 07:08.628
his deceitful, cheatin'
little brains out.

07:08.663 --> 07:11.798
- No offense, Tommy.
- None taken. Huh.

07:13.299 --> 07:16.033
Oh, holy shit. Major
headlight, 2:00. Check that out.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.638
Goddamn. Queer Eye for the
Supposedly Straight Fireman.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.438
No way. There's gotta be
an explanation.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.975
That fat chick dumping him put
him over the edge. And the vet?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.977
That Viking answer
to Shaquille O'Neal?

07:25.211 --> 07:27.712
Yeah?
I think she had a penis.

07:27.747 --> 07:30.149
My God. I like the shoes
the blond guy's wearing.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.418
What?

07:32.685 --> 07:37.123
So, you're eating lunch and
dessert at the same goddamn time?

07:37.590 --> 07:40.710
Rules, rules, rules. For a rebel
like me, they were made to be broken.

07:40.745 --> 07:43.830
- Where's the two little ones?
- Janet took 'em out for ice cream.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.433
- Tommy's gonna kill us.
- Can't happen fast enough.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.969
- Hi, Teddy. You okay?
- Yeah. It's just--

07:52.004 --> 07:56.342
I got you a pint of pistachio.
Pistachio? That's my favorite.

07:56.377 --> 07:58.810
I know.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.145
What do we do? We wait. We don't
prejudge. We don't guesstimate.

08:01.180 --> 08:05.184
We don't come to any easy assumptions.
We wait until he gets back into the house.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.687
And then? We jump all
over his gay dago ass.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.690
Sounds like a game plan to me. Huh.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.491
I just--
I-I need to--

08:13.526 --> 08:16.994
I wanna, like-- you know, like,
write somethin' to her, you know?

08:17.029 --> 08:21.000
I mean, just, you know, put my
innermost feelings and thoughts on paper.

08:21.035 --> 08:24.971
Lou, you wrote those poems after
9/11. Maybe you could help--

08:25.006 --> 08:27.974
Hey, my wife left me after
I wrote those poems, okay?

08:28.474 --> 08:32.144
Plus, the fact is, we had no real
emotional connection for six or seven years.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.815
Plus, the fact was I really didn't
find her attractive anymore, nor she me.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.384
- Can you help me?
- He can't help you. He can only write stuff that rhymes.

08:38.419 --> 08:39.885
Unless you're Springsteen,
that don't fly--

08:40.385 --> 08:42.388
- I can write stuff that doesn't rhyme.
- Bullshit.

08:42.423 --> 08:44.856
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.893
This should be a challenge to
you. Instead, you're afraid.

08:46.928 --> 08:48.912
I can smell the fear from
my side. I'm not afraid.

08:48.947 --> 08:50.862
Yes, you are. You know
what, guys? Guys, guys, guys.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.364
You know what? Never mind.
I'll buy her some more flowers.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.402
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Franco, come
on. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.405
I'm not scared. Come on, sit. Give
me a pad and pen. I'll try this.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.372
See if I have the old magic,
all right?

09:01.407 --> 09:06.412
You gotta understand-- Women wanna hear
about what's going on inside you, okay?

09:06.447 --> 09:10.416
Your feelings, your emotions-- way
deep inside. That's what they want.

09:10.451 --> 09:12.884
Okay. Uh,
my-my feelings.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.754
- Deep down.
- Down on the bottom floor.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.925
- Down deep. What do you see? What do you feel?
- Blackness and acrimony.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.928
- Okay. Tits.
- Yeah, well.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.763
We gotta go with tits.
Chicks love to hear...

09:24.798 --> 09:27.064
you talk about how great
they look, okay?

09:27.099 --> 09:31.103
So you gotta tell her how great her eyes are,
how great her lips are. You know what I mean?

09:31.504 --> 09:34.106
You know what, Tommy? That's a
good idea. You know, I love her ass.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.073
Can we maybe
talk about her ass?

09:36.108 --> 09:38.576
- I mean, her ass, it's great.
- No. Stay away from the ass, okay?

09:38.611 --> 09:41.447
- Oh, but, Tommy. - No. Listen to me.
I don't care who we're talking about--

09:41.482 --> 09:43.950
young chick, old chick, in-between,
Cindy Crawford on her best day--

09:43.985 --> 09:47.018
they all think
their ass is fat, okay?

09:47.053 --> 09:50.256
We love the ass. We think the ass
is a festival of fun. A great place--

09:50.291 --> 09:53.459
Chock-full of stuff we can do-- But
for them, the ass is death, okay?

09:53.494 --> 09:55.927
It's gravity and death
and hard goddamn times.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.965
Stay away from the ass, okay? Go with the
tits. Tits, eyelashes, eyes, all right?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.932
That's it.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.469
- What?
- You know what? Write a poem about tits,

10:03.504 --> 10:05.937
she's gonna rip it up and
shove it down your throat.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.975
I'm telling you. Chicks wanna hear about
emotions. They wanna hear about remorse.

10:09.010 --> 10:11.943
They wanna hear "I'm sorry's"
out the goddamn yin-yang.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.480
You write a poem that says, "I'm sorry.
Blah, blah. I regret. Bing, bang, boom."

10:14.515 --> 10:18.484
And then you throw in a, "Hey, I
like your nice, beautiful tits," okay?

10:20.319 --> 10:21.487
- What?
- Emotions.

10:21.522 --> 10:22.472
- Tits.
- Remorse.

10:22.507 --> 10:23.832
- Melons.
- I'm sorry.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.157
- Gazungas.
- I love you!

10:25.658 --> 10:27.124
Double peaches of pleasure--
For really small tits.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.627
Write that down. Guys-- You
know what, guys? I really just--

10:29.662 --> 10:31.664
I changed my mind. I think I'm
just gonna send some more flowers.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.166
What are you talking about?
We're just getting started.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.133
We got the ball rolling. Forget
flowers. They didn't work.

10:36.168 --> 10:39.505
That was far and away
the best barbecue I've ever had.

10:39.540 --> 10:41.472
Literally falling off
the bone.

10:41.507 --> 10:44.510
I kind of wanted tonight to be special,
you know? This being our first date...

10:44.545 --> 10:47.979
when we're not actually
committing a crime.

10:48.014 --> 10:51.350
It isn't illegal to pay for someone's
company when there's no sex involved.

10:51.717 --> 10:56.689
I know. I know. You're right. It just
all felt kind of wrong, though, didn't it?

10:57.189 --> 11:01.694
This is how I pay my rent, my bills,
my tuition, send money home to my folks.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.663
I know. I just-- I just
wish it wasn't like that.

11:05.698 --> 11:10.703
I wish it wasn't, you know,
like a business transaction.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.205
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
Candy.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.461
I really like you, Ken,
and I wanna keep seeing you.

11:19.496 --> 11:22.214
But I can't keep explaining
this to you every time...

11:22.249 --> 11:24.383
- we get together--
- April?

11:24.750 --> 11:28.821
Let's just go to the movies. Hey, I've been
calling you. Why aren't you returning my calls?

11:28.856 --> 11:31.557
Is this guy a friend of
yours? Go away, Gary. Come on.

11:31.957 --> 11:34.160
- Don't walk away from me, bitch.
- Hey, you know what?

11:34.195 --> 11:36.228
Why don't you learn how
to talk to the lady, okay?

11:36.729 --> 11:38.696
Uh, that's not a lady, pal.
That's a whore.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.699
Kenny. You didn't hear me
the first time, scumbag?

11:41.734 --> 11:45.237
Look at her, pal. Look at her. See,
she sure looks like a lady to me, right?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.757
If you're not capable of talking
to her like one, you let me know,

11:47.792 --> 11:50.242
and I'll make sure you finish
eating the side of this truck, okay?

11:50.743 --> 11:53.245
Okay? Okay? Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.921
How many more names
you got?

12:07.293 --> 12:09.261
So I did some more checkin' up
on Father Murphy.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.729
Ah, give it up,
Mick, seriously.

12:11.764 --> 12:15.768
Listen, the kid is by his side all goddamn
day and most of the night, in the rectory.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.787
Well-- Hey,
man. How are you?

12:17.822 --> 12:19.772
Hey, friend.
What's happenin'?

12:19.807 --> 12:22.274
Been good?
Great, thanks.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.276
Maybe the kid's
a believer, okay?

12:24.777 --> 12:27.279
Maybe he believes in Jesus and God and
the church like we used to. Remember?

12:27.314 --> 12:29.246
Uh-uh. This kid is
from a broken home, okay?

12:29.281 --> 12:31.283
He never knew his father.
The whole family's a mess.

12:31.784 --> 12:33.584
Yeah, and we're from
Disneyland. Hello!

12:33.619 --> 12:36.455
Angelo, how you doing?
Hey, man. How are you?

12:36.956 --> 12:39.959
What's going on?
Nice guy.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.928
Angelo?

12:43.963 --> 12:47.431
You know, I was in a meeting
in Little Italy last week.

12:47.466 --> 12:50.970
What? It was a tough crowd. I
needed all the help I could get.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.976
You're always judgin' people,
you know?

12:58.978 --> 13:02.947
Thanks for walking me home.
Gary was always a total sicko.

13:02.982 --> 13:06.819
That's why I had to cut him off. Yeah,
well, occupational hazard, I guess.

13:09.088 --> 13:12.056
You wanna come upstairs?

13:12.091 --> 13:14.058
I should probably go.
Come on.

13:14.093 --> 13:17.930
I could brew us some tea or
somethin'. It's, like, 85 degrees out.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.817
Okay. Iced tea?

13:20.852 --> 13:23.669
Yeah. Sure.

13:29.208 --> 13:32.678
I asked you-- asked you-- to
keep on banging my wife, didn't I?

13:32.713 --> 13:36.783
I gave you permission to
sleep with my wife. You did.

13:36.818 --> 13:40.853
Repeatedly, until she got
pregnant again. Mm-hmm.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.154
But instead--

13:43.189 --> 13:46.525
instead, you go so far south
on the assignment,

13:46.560 --> 13:49.212
you turn her into
a full-blown lesbian!

13:49.247 --> 13:52.557
How in the goddamn hell
does that happen?

13:52.592 --> 13:55.868
Well, you said
she wanted a girl right?

14:01.040 --> 14:02.708
You know what, coz?

14:03.209 --> 14:05.176
I'd like nothing better
than to get into a big,

14:05.211 --> 14:08.714
ghost-and-walking-dead-man brawl
with you right now, but-- But, what?

14:27.499 --> 14:29.501
So I started looking at
apartments for all of us.

14:32.738 --> 14:35.241
That's good.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.913
I'm, uh-- I'm gonna just run
to the bathroom real quick.

14:42.414 --> 14:45.000
Come on, kiddo. Eat up.
It's good for you.

14:45.035 --> 14:47.586
What are you
thinking about?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.939
Honestly? My wife.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.759
Oh. Sorry I asked.

14:54.226 --> 14:58.197
She just pops into my head every now
and then like a 10-second nightmare.

14:58.232 --> 15:01.565
You miss her? Well, as
bad as it was at the end,

15:01.600 --> 15:07.106
there's something to be said about having
a warm body lying next to you at night,

15:07.606 --> 15:10.142
even if you can't stand
lookin' her in the eye.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.611
I should get back
to the house.

15:12.646 --> 15:14.745
Don't.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.747
Don't leave me.

15:16.782 --> 15:19.785
You can sleep on the couch.
It's really comfy.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.288
Candy.
Come on, Ken.

15:23.789 --> 15:26.292
I hate the idea of
my knight in shining armor...

15:26.327 --> 15:30.796
sleeping in some
filthy utility closet.

15:31.297 --> 15:35.801
I've got some old Bogart movies,
some games. It'll be fun.

15:36.302 --> 15:40.306
You like Cranium? Yeah, but you
gotta have four people to play.

15:40.341 --> 15:43.309
We'll figure somethin' out.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.278
Oh, and, um,

15:47.313 --> 15:49.148
to answer your question
from earlier,

15:50.482 --> 15:53.450
I only have one name.

15:53.485 --> 15:56.488
- It's Danielle.
- Danny.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.444
"Selectra."

16:26.952 --> 16:29.288
Okay, Googles.

16:29.555 --> 16:32.758
Selectra. All right.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.992
All right.

16:35.027 --> 16:38.831
Come to daddy.
Selectra XL.

16:39.231 --> 16:41.700
"Safe and effective
antidepressant." Mm-hmm.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.600
"Reduces anxiety.

16:43.635 --> 16:47.139
Stop fretting. Enjoy
living fully." Uh-huh.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.606
"Improves sex drive."
Nice.

16:49.641 --> 16:52.644
"Possible side effects."
La, la, la, la, la.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.647
"Oily anal discharge."
Small price to pay.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.614
"Dry mouth."

16:57.649 --> 17:01.853
"Increased vaginal lubrication."
Yeah, daddy.

17:01.888 --> 17:06.058
Thank you, God,
and science.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.866
Big.

17:15.901 --> 17:19.369
Okay.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.372
Oh.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.409
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.920
Hey, everybody.
Good morning, sweetie.

17:34.955 --> 17:37.888
Hi, Daddy.
What's going on?

17:37.923 --> 17:41.427
Oh, these are the plates you were
talking about? Yeah. What do you think?

17:41.462 --> 17:44.864
They go great with your hair. Oh.

17:44.899 --> 17:48.232
I gotta go though.
So, coffee?

17:48.267 --> 17:51.520
Oh. That would be here.
Oh, thank you.

17:51.555 --> 17:54.738
And last night was great. Mm-hmm.

17:54.773 --> 17:57.741
Mmm, I know.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.779
All right, see you later. Okay.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.248
All right, guys.
I love you.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.285
I love you, Daddy.
Bye-bye. Have a great day.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.287
Bye, Daddy.
I'll see you tonight.

18:08.322 --> 18:10.587
See you.
Bye-bye.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.958
Is there something
wrong with Dad?

18:12.993 --> 18:15.259
Yeah.

18:15.294 --> 18:19.464
- Is he sick?
- Kind of.

18:19.499 --> 18:23.635
- He's in love.
- Oh.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.637
With who?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.976
Okay.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.546
Hey.
Shut up.

18:35.581 --> 18:38.584
No. I didn't even say-- Stop
talking now while you're still ahead.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.051
Jesus, Laura, please. Oh,
if Franco sent you here--

18:41.086 --> 18:44.054
No. Come on. He'd kill me if he
knew I was here. Please, look.

18:44.089 --> 18:48.594
I've been concentrating really hard
about what I wanted to tell you right now.

18:48.629 --> 18:52.097
Okay.
You have 60 seconds.

18:52.364 --> 18:55.632
Okay. Wow. Great.
Shit. Um-- Fifty-five.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.670
Wait. I'm not good under this kind of
pressure. Really. I just-- I need some--

18:59.037 --> 18:59.838
Okay, Franco is--
Fifty.

19:00.239 --> 19:03.108
Franco's really, really--
He's really, uh--

19:03.609 --> 19:05.809
Forty-five seconds.
Okay, Jesus. Uh, he's--

19:05.844 --> 19:09.114
Cut to the chase. I'm gonna. I'm
just-- Wait. What do you mean?

19:09.548 --> 19:12.149
Forty seconds.
The important part?

19:12.184 --> 19:14.620
It's all important. That's what I'm
saying. It's all really important,

19:15.120 --> 19:17.189
what I have to tell you.
Thirty-five seconds.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.959
Okay, well. Wow. That's a really
nice watch. Thank you. Thirty seconds.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.696
Where'd you get that? Franco gave it
to me. You're blowing this, big-time.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.865
There you go. That-That's
the answer right there.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.385
Where's the answer?
The watch.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.835
The watch says 20 seconds. Yeah.

19:31.870 --> 19:35.040
Okay, well, so Franco gives you this really
beautiful-- Like, what is this, a Rolex?

19:35.075 --> 19:37.709
Come on.
No, it's a Fossil.

19:37.943 --> 19:40.344
Oh. Oh. So what does that
mean? Like, it's really old?

19:40.379 --> 19:44.716
It means you have 10 seconds. It's
a designer name. It's hip, it's cool.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.985
Okay, great. Franco gives you
this really cool, hip watch.

19:47.486 --> 19:48.987
Come on. That's cutting
to the chase right there.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.390
All he ever gave the damn
waitress was a stupid necklace.

19:51.425 --> 19:55.025
He gave her a necklace?
No. No. I just--

19:55.060 --> 19:57.062
Wait, how many-- How much
more seconds do I have on the--

19:57.097 --> 19:59.064
on the--
I don't know,

19:59.565 --> 20:02.067
because I broke my watch!

20:04.069 --> 20:06.071
Yeah, well,
whose fault is that?

20:08.273 --> 20:11.743
It's a drug called Selectra, Doc. I think
it'll, you know, help me get over the hump.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.746
I know it very well. I've prescribed
it to a lot of my patients recently.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.749
It's fairly harmless. We've
had nothing but success with it.

20:17.784 --> 20:21.187
Oh, great. So you can
hook me up? Not a chance.

20:21.222 --> 20:24.590
What do you mean? The
last time you were here,

20:24.625 --> 20:27.426
you told me to kiss
your white Irish ass.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.762
See, that's why I need this drug,
Doc. I'm-I'm completely out of control.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.764
Tommy, I have
to tell you...

20:33.265 --> 20:35.232
to kiss my white Jewish ass.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.270
Best of luck to you.

20:50.782 --> 20:53.285
Uh, bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

20:53.785 --> 20:56.288
Tommy? Hey, Father. How you doing?

20:56.788 --> 21:00.190
This is a nice surprise.

21:00.225 --> 21:04.229
Yeah, I just thought, you know what?
Let's go down there and just atone.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.697
You know what I mean?
Atone.

21:06.732 --> 21:11.737
Atone for, you know, all the
sins of the last, you know,

21:11.772 --> 21:15.741
five, 10, 15 years,
you know?

21:16.241 --> 21:17.743
Like?
Huh?

21:18.210 --> 21:20.110
Like what?
Oh. Uh,

21:20.145 --> 21:24.616
well, you know, like the, uh,
cursing and the-- and the-- and the--

21:24.651 --> 21:29.087
Well, a lot of the jerkin'-- I'm
sorry. Masturbating, masturbating.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.555
I get it.
Yeah, I mean, once--

21:31.590 --> 21:35.093
Once DVD, uh, came in with
the porn-- Whew, I was like--

21:35.128 --> 21:37.863
Tommy. Tommy, I understand.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,

21:37.898 --> 21:40.599
jerkin' off's one thing,
but I mean, the cursing,

21:40.634 --> 21:45.103
the carousing, the cheating,
the lying and--

21:45.604 --> 21:47.105
Wait a minute.

21:47.606 --> 21:51.610
Actually, uh, carousing and cheating
are kind of the same thing, right,

21:51.645 --> 21:54.046
in-in-in the-- You know,
in the eyes of the Lord?

21:54.081 --> 21:56.982
Say 10 Hail Marys
and 10 Our Fathers.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.984
That's the penance?

21:59.484 --> 22:01.418
Great.

22:01.453 --> 22:04.421
All right. Thanks.

22:04.456 --> 22:07.924
Go in peace, my son.
Huh?

22:07.959 --> 22:10.462
I said go in peace.
Oh, peace.

22:24.142 --> 22:27.212
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be
thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

22:27.247 --> 22:30.215
on earth as it is in heaven.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.685
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

22:34.720 --> 22:39.224
Thy kingdom come, thy will be
done, on earth as it is in heaven.

22:39.725 --> 22:41.727
Blessed--

22:43.228 --> 22:45.195
Eh.

22:45.230 --> 22:48.233
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.236
Blessed?

22:55.240 --> 22:57.743
Blessed art thou?
Blessed--

23:01.913 --> 23:04.516
Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea after all.

23:27.005 --> 23:30.876
-Sean!
- No, wait. No. Hold on a second. Let me explain.

23:30.911 --> 23:33.744
What? Explain!

23:33.779 --> 23:35.781
All right, never mind.
Just hit me.

23:44.456 --> 23:47.709
- Hey, Lou, Chief.
- Hey. Where'd you get the faggy coffee?

23:47.744 --> 23:50.927
And the faggy-- but I'm sure
very tasty-- looking croissant?

23:50.962 --> 23:53.965
Tommy. He brought 'em in like five
minutes ago. He's got some for everybody.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.767
Tommy Gavin?
Where is he?

23:56.802 --> 24:00.036
- He's out polishin' the rig.
- He's what?

24:00.071 --> 24:02.474
Okay, see, this is the problem
with stem cell research.

24:02.707 --> 24:04.242
It starts with a little egg
in a petri dish.

24:04.743 --> 24:08.246
Next, you have an all-new, much-improved
Tommy Gavin. I gotta see this.

24:08.281 --> 24:11.249
Probably whistling while
he works. I'm gonna watch.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.723
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

24:19.758 --> 24:22.377
Sweet chocolate Christ. I got
plenty of coffee for everybody.

24:22.412 --> 24:24.996
I got double-mocha mint, uh,
cappuccinos-- There's two of those.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.166
It's like you're drinking coffee, but you
live in an ice-cream world. Unbelievable.

24:28.201 --> 24:31.002
Sorry I didn't bring it into the
kitchen, guys. I ran into the probie,

24:31.037 --> 24:32.969
and we started talking about
is he gay or not.

24:33.004 --> 24:36.007
Then I noticed a couple of smudges on the
rig, and blah, blah, blah, long story short.

24:36.508 --> 24:39.309
- Anyways, he's not gay. Tell 'em.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

24:39.344 --> 24:41.847
After hanging out at your place
at the party and everything, Chief,

24:42.347 --> 24:44.349
I realized all those hot chicks
who hang out with gay guys--

24:44.850 --> 24:48.318
Fag hags. Yeah. They're all pretty
much just desperate to get laid.

24:48.353 --> 24:51.623
But they're looking for a straight guy
who's comfortable enough in his own skin...

24:51.658 --> 24:54.359
to hang out with gay guys too. See?

24:54.394 --> 24:56.194
So you're a fag hag? No.

24:56.695 --> 24:59.197
- Yes.
- Kind of. Show 'em the moves.

24:59.232 --> 25:00.997
The moves?
Yeah, yeah.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.535
You have to be able to, uh,
cut rug, too, you know. Dance.

25:04.035 --> 25:06.204
- So I developed a couple of moves.
- Show 'em, show 'em.

25:06.571 --> 25:08.707
- I feel kind of weird.
- No, no. Don't feel weird. It's good. It's cool.

25:09.207 --> 25:11.209
He's gonna cut some rug
for us, Chief. Cut some rug.

25:11.244 --> 25:14.678
Yeah, it's a dancing term. Yeah, sure.

25:14.713 --> 25:17.716
Does the thing with his mouth.
They call that a beat box.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.186
Cool, right?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.223
Do the car thing you were
telling me about. Oh, yeah.

25:25.258 --> 25:27.225
I'll be the passenger
riding shotgun. Ready?

25:30.462 --> 25:31.997
Chief, slap me.
What?

25:32.497 --> 25:35.200
Hard, across the face.

25:35.235 --> 25:37.868
Shit.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.238
What?
I'm not dreaming this.

25:40.605 --> 25:42.073
No, you're not. It's a goddamn
nightmare is what it is.

25:42.574 --> 25:44.826
Hey, wow. Franco must've
hit me harder than I thought.

25:44.861 --> 25:47.043
- I could've sworn I just saw him dancing.
- Hey, Sean.

25:47.078 --> 25:52.083
Hey, do you want a croissant? I got,
uh, spinach, spinach with cheese.

25:52.118 --> 25:56.254
- What? They're really good.
- Uh, Lou, Chief?

25:56.488 --> 25:59.024
I guess he's
not hungry, hmm?

25:59.059 --> 26:01.491
All right.

26:01.526 --> 26:04.029
This thing is
really dirty.

26:05.530 --> 26:08.533
Hey, look,
I'm not in the mood.

26:11.036 --> 26:13.538
You sneak, you.
Yeah.

26:17.042 --> 26:19.075
"Soon I disappear
beneath one eager wish.

26:19.110 --> 26:23.048
"Your face, your fingers, the wet
promise across the tip of your lips.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.515
This is what you do to me."

26:25.550 --> 26:27.552
"An eye, an ocean.
Each glance,

26:27.587 --> 26:30.555
a deeper blue sky."

26:31.056 --> 26:33.558
Any man that
can write this...

26:34.059 --> 26:36.561
has to be in love.

26:36.596 --> 26:39.064
Right. Yeah, love.

26:43.068 --> 26:46.805
Where did you get this from?
What, you mean? Like what magazine?

26:49.808 --> 26:52.310
No, like,
I'm serious, Franco.

26:52.345 --> 26:54.778
Right. Sorry.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.280
Um, my heart, you know?

26:57.315 --> 27:00.819
I mean, baby, my heart, it
was broken, you know? Mmm.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.661
- Is Tommy Gavin gay now?
- Ah, they're dancing again.

27:10.161 --> 27:13.164
I knew Tommy Gavin, sir. Tommy
Gavin was a friend of mine.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.465
And that man out there
is no Tommy Gavin.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.586
- He's smiling. He's all happy.
- Maybe he's got a disease or something.

27:18.621 --> 27:21.673
- Hey, is there some kind of cancer that makes you dance?
- Dancer cancer.

27:22.073 --> 27:24.808
- Travolta trot?
- Hey. You.

27:24.843 --> 27:27.846
Hey, I haven't even seen Laura since
the last time-- You are my hero!

27:27.881 --> 27:31.982
Damn! Oh, my God. That poem
knocked her socks off, Lou.

27:32.017 --> 27:35.520
You crafty son of a bitch. Sneaking it
into her locker. That was genius, man.

27:35.555 --> 27:37.522
She loves me again.

27:38.023 --> 27:39.524
I owe you, brother.
Word.

27:40.025 --> 27:42.193
Big-time.
Yeah.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.863
Yes!

27:47.198 --> 27:49.034
Did you write
a poem-- No.

27:49.534 --> 27:52.037
You didn't put the
poem in the locker? No.

27:52.072 --> 27:54.039
Then who did?

28:08.219 --> 28:09.988
Oh, no.
Huh.

28:15.226 --> 28:17.062
Engine.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.535
Boys, this place is abandoned,
but the neighbor reports...

28:25.570 --> 28:28.073
there's been people shacked up
inside from time to time. Got it.

28:28.108 --> 28:30.575
Hey, you write a poem and
stick it in Laura's locker?

28:30.610 --> 28:33.543
Uh, yep. Yep? What do you mean, yep?

28:33.578 --> 28:36.081
Yeah, I did. What do you mean?
You're not gonna try to lie about it?

28:36.116 --> 28:38.048
Nope.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.050
Hey, Chief. Do me a favor? What's wrong?

28:40.085 --> 28:42.587
Take this, hit me in the head
with it as hard as you can. What?

28:45.590 --> 28:49.559
Yeah.

28:49.594 --> 28:53.098
Yeah.
What do you got?

28:55.233 --> 28:59.104
Yeah, Chief, I got nobody
up here. It's all clear.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.073
Geez, they should tear
this dump down, huh?

29:03.108 --> 29:06.611
- Hey, the top two floors are clear.
- You guys remember this broad?

29:06.646 --> 29:08.547
That chick that was
on life support, right?

29:08.582 --> 29:10.733
She was on life support
for, like, 15 years.

29:10.768 --> 29:12.849
Yeah, I saw her wedding
pictures on CNN, man.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.619
Before she went in the coma,
she was hot-- real hot.

29:14.986 --> 29:17.055
Remember her husband finally
had 'em pull the plug?

29:17.090 --> 29:19.124
Yeah, but her parents
wanted to keep her alive.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.559
That's the thing with coma people.
They're in the coma for 15, 20 years.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.860
All of a sudden, they wake
up-- Bang. They start talking.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.798
- Know what she would've said if she suddenly woke up?
- What?

29:26.833 --> 29:31.302
- "Does my ass look fat
in this bed?"

29:34.906 --> 29:36.606
Tom!
Tommy!

29:36.641 --> 29:38.143
Move it. Let's go.
Let's go.

29:39.644 --> 29:41.813
Come on!

29:53.625 --> 29:56.561
- He's not movin'!
915 to 15 Alpha.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.330
Notifying there's a possible
collapse with a firefighter down.

30:23.688 --> 30:26.191
Do you believe in
my Father now, Tommy?

30:27.725 --> 30:30.228
Has he proven himself
to you now?

30:30.263 --> 30:32.197
Stand, Brother.

30:32.232 --> 30:34.699
Stand up.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.405
Whoa.
Faith, Tommy.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.540
You must have faith.

30:42.907 --> 30:45.376
Without it, there's no hope.

30:46.711 --> 30:51.549
Without hope,
you cannot live.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.309
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I think.

31:01.344 --> 31:03.561
My back's a little
screwed up but--

31:03.596 --> 31:07.065
That's
impossible.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.906
Whatever the hell it is
you're on,

31:16.407 --> 31:18.409
I want double the dose.

31:20.912 --> 31:22.879
Me too.

31:22.914 --> 31:26.717
Let there be peace on Earth ?

31:26.752 --> 31:30.486
And let it begin with me

31:30.521 --> 31:34.775
Let there be peace on Earth ?

31:34.810 --> 31:39.030
The peace that
was meant to be

31:39.530 --> 31:44.068
With God as our father

31:44.103 --> 31:48.571
Brothers, all are we

31:48.606 --> 31:54.212
Let there be peace on Earth ?

31:54.247 --> 31:57.615
And let it begin

31:57.849 --> 32:02.919
With me

32:02.954 --> 32:05.623
- Please be seated.
- She didn't like the line about,

32:05.658 --> 32:08.293
"My heart beats full for you.
My tears, like the rain,

32:08.328 --> 32:10.593
pit-pat upon--"
No.

32:10.628 --> 32:13.596
Um, what about the other one,
where-where I go, uh,

32:13.631 --> 32:15.967
"I can think only of you. My
hands tremble as you approach."

32:16.467 --> 32:17.969
No, actually, she really
hated that line.

32:18.469 --> 32:20.436
Hey, guys. What's goin' on?
Hi. What's up, Shakespeare?

32:20.471 --> 32:23.975
Takin' up a collection. I wanna get
some flower arrangements for the house.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.962
Make it smell nice. You know
what I mean? Brighten things up.

32:26.997 --> 32:29.914
Yeah, it'd be nice. You know,
Laura loved the poem so much,

32:29.949 --> 32:31.881
she asked me for a second one? Oh.

32:31.916 --> 32:34.419
I was lookin' for you, but I couldn't
find you. So, uh, Lou volunteered.

32:34.919 --> 32:37.387
Yeah, she hated it. She
hated it. She did not hate it.

32:37.422 --> 32:40.158
She didn't hate it. She just liked
the first one better. That's it.

32:40.193 --> 32:42.827
Well, you were right. Talk
about her body, minus the ass.

32:42.862 --> 32:46.014
Goddamn grand slam.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

32:46.049 --> 32:49.132
So? So now we need a third poem.

32:49.167 --> 32:52.170
Sometime by the end of this week
would be great. How you feeling?

32:52.205 --> 32:53.938
I feel great.
Yeah?

32:54.439 --> 32:56.406
Yeah. Cool, man. You look great.

32:56.441 --> 32:59.444
So does that mean-- Where the hell do
you get the nerve to start writing poetry?

32:59.479 --> 33:02.164
You-You know that this place
is run like The Godfather,okay?

33:02.199 --> 33:04.849
The Corleones, they control
the politicians, the courts,

33:04.884 --> 33:06.816
they control the unions,
all right?

33:06.851 --> 33:09.687
Around here, we got the probie. He
controls all the homo crap, okay?

33:09.722 --> 33:12.207
Garrity controls all the
stupid retard bullshit. Mm-hmm.

33:12.242 --> 33:14.692
Franco is our pussy man.
You control the drinking...

33:14.727 --> 33:17.160
and all the fire-hero-worship
crap, okay?

33:17.195 --> 33:20.448
Poetry is my territory.
You're muscling in on my turf!

33:20.483 --> 33:23.093
Wow. You've really gotta take
some kind of a chill pill,

33:23.128 --> 33:25.703
because you're very upset.
Let me ask something else.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.171
Where were the tits?
Where were the tits?

33:28.206 --> 33:31.209
All week long, "The poem, it's gotta
have tits. Gotta have tits. It needs tits.

33:31.244 --> 33:35.213
It needs tits. It needs tits."
Fourteen goddamn lines, not one tit!

33:35.248 --> 33:37.180
It was implied?
Oh, it was implied?

33:37.215 --> 33:40.468
Yes. It was subtext. It was
subtext. Subtext, my ass!

33:40.503 --> 33:43.113
What are you, Walt-goddamn-Whitman
all of a sudden?

33:43.148 --> 33:45.688
The Tommy Gavin I know
would never write that poem.

33:45.723 --> 33:48.726
The Tommy Gavin I know would never write
that poem to seduce his own piece of ass,

33:48.761 --> 33:50.693
let alone a buddy's,
all right?

33:50.728 --> 33:54.197
You wanna know something?
This, the fall you just took,

33:54.232 --> 33:56.734
the dancing, the singing, the
cleaning, the la, la, la, la, la--

33:56.769 --> 33:59.003
What the hell are you on?
Goofballs.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.738
I didn't tell you?
No.

34:01.239 --> 34:03.206
Oh. Remember the thing about
goofballs? I checked into it.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.743
She was on the goofballs. And I
took some of them from her purse.

34:05.778 --> 34:08.746
And, uh, they're workin'.
I mean, she's happy, I'm happy.

34:09.246 --> 34:10.748
She loves me.
I love her.

34:11.248 --> 34:13.501
I love everybody.
Hey, I love you.

34:13.536 --> 34:15.717
Hey, uh, the poem thing.

34:15.753 --> 34:18.554
- You want me to take that or-- -
Why don't you take that assignment?

34:18.589 --> 34:21.759
- Cool. Great. - Tom, one more thing.
Next time you feel like kissing me--

34:21.793 --> 34:24.762
- Mm-hmm?
- Dinner and a movie first.

34:24.797 --> 34:26.931
You're so funny.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.437
I don't know. Those cops
looked good during that warm-up.

34:32.472 --> 34:34.438
I'm having second thoughts
about dropping that 500.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.442
500? Jesus,
I only bet 25.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.409
Dollars?
Yeah.

34:39.444 --> 34:41.446
You told me he went in for 200.
He went in for three.

34:41.481 --> 34:43.947
I didn't pay shit. Hey,
guys. Guys, just relax.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.951
Did you see the way Tommy recovered
from that fall the other day?

34:46.985 --> 34:49.954
He's in some sort of a zone.
This thing is a lock.

34:49.989 --> 34:51.754
500?
Yes.

34:51.789 --> 34:55.626
All right, guys. Uh, I just
wanna say a couple of things.

34:55.661 --> 34:59.130
Um, I want everybody to give
110% out there tonight.

34:59.165 --> 35:02.633
Not 105, not 107--
110%, okay?

35:02.668 --> 35:04.600
Yeah. Let's go.
Do it!

35:04.635 --> 35:06.637
Let's go kick some ass!

35:07.138 --> 35:10.308
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. Let's rip their
balls off and stuff 'em down their throats!

35:10.808 --> 35:12.775
Hey, Ryan. Hang on,
hang on. You know, here.

35:12.810 --> 35:15.813
Grab the, uh, hand of your
teammate standing next to you.

35:15.848 --> 35:18.781
Dear God,

35:18.816 --> 35:23.070
um, let us tonight
play a great game of hockey.

35:23.105 --> 35:27.325
Give us the grace and the
will and the strength...

35:27.360 --> 35:29.292
to play our best,

35:29.327 --> 35:32.597
but not to get injured and not to
injure anybody else on the other team.

35:32.632 --> 35:35.798
And most of all,
most importantly,

35:35.833 --> 35:39.837
thank you for bringing us here
together to enjoy each other's company.

35:39.872 --> 35:42.305
Amen.
All right, boys.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.342
Let's go have a good time. Come on.

35:45.343 --> 35:47.310
Wh-What-- What's
going on? Hey.

35:47.345 --> 35:49.847
All right, screw the
shithead. Let's kick some ass!

35:52.683 --> 35:54.785
No way we can
lose today, Gavin.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.955
Well, you know, Todd, it's really not who
wins or loses. It's how you play the game.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.256
Yeah.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.743
Todd? Yeah, that's his first name, Todd.

36:02.778 --> 36:05.161
Well, who gives a shit?
I'm just sayin'.

36:05.196 --> 36:08.533
- Oh, you're gonna play Mr. Nice Guy now?
- Yep.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.868
Yeah. Well, look.
Win or lose today, we win.

36:10.903 --> 36:13.271
- How's that?
- You'll see.

36:13.306 --> 36:15.640
Whatever.

36:16.874 --> 36:19.377
Let's go!

36:29.053 --> 36:32.390
Put some defense
on this team! Come on!

36:38.563 --> 36:42.066
What did I tell you, huh? What
did I say in the locker room?

36:42.101 --> 36:44.569
Did you hear my prayer?
What, are you kidding me?

36:44.604 --> 36:46.536
I said no fighting.

36:46.571 --> 36:49.407
Go sit on the bench for three shifts and
ruminate about what you just did, okay?

36:49.442 --> 36:51.977
I would, but I don't know
what ruminate means.

36:52.012 --> 36:54.512
Well, ask one of the fellows
on the bench.

36:57.582 --> 37:01.085
What the hell was that?

37:01.586 --> 37:03.588
Don't worry about it, guys, huh?
He's just playing a head game.

37:04.088 --> 37:07.592
Don't sweat anything. I'm
gonna lose my 25 bucks.

37:07.627 --> 37:09.392
Jesus.

37:09.427 --> 37:11.262
Unbelievable.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.266
Huh.
Oh, shit!

37:17.768 --> 37:21.105
What the hell was that?
God!

37:26.944 --> 37:29.447
Nice goal, Todd.
Good move.

37:29.482 --> 37:31.449
Blow me, Gavin.

37:47.965 --> 37:50.217
They keep backing up
into the goal!

37:50.252 --> 37:52.435
Gotta play "D."
That's right, Chief.

37:52.470 --> 37:54.937
Tell me, is this whole getting
creamed thing part of the head game,

37:54.972 --> 37:57.475
or are we gonna score six goals in
the next five minutes? You know what?

37:57.510 --> 38:01.812
Here's your 25 bucks, all right?
Go wait in the lobby, seriously.

38:16.494 --> 38:20.730
You okay? Hey, Tommy,
he's the enemy, man.

38:20.765 --> 38:23.300
- I know, but he got hit in the head.
- Gavin! Give it up.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.801
I'm genuinely concerned about
him. He got hit in the head.

38:25.836 --> 38:28.506
- We're up by eight goals. Enough head games.
- I'm trying to be nice.

38:28.541 --> 38:34.178
Do you believe how deep this
guy'll go? He's the devil on Earth.

38:41.352 --> 38:43.653
Good game, man. Good game. Good game.

38:43.688 --> 38:47.692
Hey, man. How you doing? Sorry about
the goalie, really. Yeah. Yeah, right.

38:48.192 --> 38:50.194
You look awful happy for a guy
who just got his pussy waxed.

38:50.428 --> 38:53.364
- Hey, you guys were the better team today, man.
- Jesus, will you shut up?

38:53.399 --> 38:55.665
He is always in a bad mood.
Hey, nice game.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.703
Lord, thank you for making sure
that that goalie was not injured--

38:58.738 --> 39:00.705
Bullshit.

39:01.205 --> 39:03.172
and also, obviously,
for letting us have...

39:03.207 --> 39:06.210
these last two or three hours together
doing something we really enjoy.

39:06.245 --> 39:10.214
And please forgive Mungo for
his lapse in judgment on the ice,

39:10.715 --> 39:12.550
and his equally...

39:14.385 --> 39:16.387
large lapse in language
just a moment ago.

39:16.422 --> 39:20.356
Amen.
All right, guys.

39:20.391 --> 39:22.358
You losin' it?
Nice prayer.

39:22.393 --> 39:25.563
What's going on? Take a
look. There's your car?

39:25.796 --> 39:28.197
What?

39:28.232 --> 39:30.668
Hey. Hey,
that's my car!

39:32.169 --> 39:34.537
Hey, hey! Hey, wait!
That's my car! Hang on!

39:34.572 --> 39:38.409
Got ya, Gavin.
Got ya, big-time.

39:38.776 --> 39:42.378
Hey, Todd. I gotta tell you, man,
this is a very funny gag. Really.

39:42.413 --> 39:45.750
- This is one of the best gags I've ever seen. How you doing?
- Stop calling me Todd.

39:45.785 --> 39:49.086
- Oh, I'm gonna kick your ass.
- See, now, that's the reaction I'm looking for.

39:49.453 --> 39:53.424
I might even kick your ass. But he planned
the whole thing. That's what I'm saying.

39:53.459 --> 39:58.446
How far will I fall

39:58.481 --> 40:03.399
Before I break

40:03.434 --> 40:07.938
So sweet, completely

40:09.940 --> 40:14.779
It scares me how much

40:14.814 --> 40:19.784
I enjoy my way

40:21.285 --> 40:25.122
A way not easy

40:26.624 --> 40:32.129
But lights out feels so good

40:32.164 --> 40:36.133
Don't spare my fate

40:38.135 --> 40:41.138
Say viva, evil

40:42.640 --> 40:46.143
Its unsightly glow

40:46.644 --> 40:50.147
Lights my way below

40:50.182 --> 40:54.168
How I love it

40:54.203 --> 40:57.180
So completely

40:57.215 --> 41:00.122
I suppose

41:00.157 --> 41:03.160
Its unsightly glow

41:03.661 --> 41:07.164
Lights my way below

41:07.199 --> 41:11.185
How I love it

41:11.220 --> 41:14.447
So completely

41:14.482 --> 41:17.640
I suppose

41:17.675 --> 41:21.679
Its sweetness

41:21.714 --> 41:25.683
Is my weakness

41:25.718 --> 41:28.686
Aidez-moi

41:29.186 --> 41:32.439
I am the last

41:32.474 --> 41:35.693
To know

42:28.412 --> 42:29.847
Cloudland.
