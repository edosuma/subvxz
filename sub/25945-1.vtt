00:28.921 --> 00:30.481
Umm...

00:33.521 --> 00:37.401
Do you euthanize animals here?
- Those too.

00:49.321 --> 00:53.601
How do you do it?
- It depends on the size of the animal.

00:53.761 --> 00:57.561
The small ones get gassed
and the bigger ones shot.

00:57.721 --> 01:00.081
Cats get the gas.

01:00.241 --> 01:02.041
Will Nekku suffer?

01:08.401 --> 01:14.001
I assume you live in a flat?
Alone with your cat?

01:16.161 --> 01:19.721
She alleviates your
biological need to nurture -

01:19.881 --> 01:23.201
helps with the loneliness
and keeps you company.

01:25.921 --> 01:32.601
Your flat is a 20-odd
square metre prison.

01:34.001 --> 01:39.601
The normal habitat for a feline
is over a square kilometre.

01:40.921 --> 01:43.921
It can't be replaced
by an evening cuddle -

01:44.081 --> 01:47.001
or a designer scratch post.

01:50.321 --> 01:54.401
To top it all, Nekku
is old and sick.

01:55.161 --> 02:00.081
She is anaemic and hasn't absorbed
nutrition properly for a long time.

02:01.681 --> 02:06.961
And there's more to it than anaemia,
but you have been in denial.

02:15.321 --> 02:18.321
And you ask me if
Nekku is suffering.

04:00.881 --> 04:05.001
EUTHANIZER

04:12.641 --> 04:14.721
Hi.

04:14.881 --> 04:17.041
No, I haven't forgotten.

04:17.201 --> 04:20.081
I can't leave her in
the car for a second.

04:20.241 --> 04:22.881
I'll pick her up
right after work.

04:24.201 --> 04:27.361
Did you find out how
much it costs'?

04:28.961 --> 04:31.121
Well, yeah.

04:31.281 --> 04:34.041
Right. Bye!

04:35.921 --> 04:39.161
Petri, will you come
into the office?

04:42.321 --> 04:47.201
Right, about that raise?

04:49.521 --> 04:57.481
I had Jomppe do an inventory and
the numbers aren't adding up.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.561
Oh, yeah? What's wrong?

05:00.721 --> 05:05.041
We're missing a couple of winter
tyres and four summer tyres.

05:05.201 --> 05:08.801
There might be more. - Right...

05:11.721 --> 05:14.921
You wouldn't happen to
know anything about this?

05:15.081 --> 05:19.441
I have no idea, but I would
question that hippie's math.

05:19.601 --> 05:23.441
He's just out of school and
clueless about these things.

05:25.081 --> 05:30.281
Right, it could
just be a mistake.

05:30.441 --> 05:34.481
There are some places that
he probably forgot to check.

05:34.641 --> 05:37.921
I'll have a look. I'm sure
they'll turn up somewhere.

05:38.081 --> 05:39.921
If it's no trouble.

06:05.801 --> 06:08.161
- Hi there.
- Hi.

06:09.881 --> 06:12.641
This here is Vatanen of
the Thousand Vaginas.

06:13.561 --> 06:16.081
- Hi, I'm Simo.
- Vatanen.

06:17.521 --> 06:23.521
Don't believe everything that
Virtanen of the Single Vagina says.

06:25.161 --> 06:27.561
That bastard made our Elisa cry.

06:28.481 --> 06:33.041
Who is he?
- Veijo, one of our local specialities.

06:33.201 --> 06:36.441
He euthanizes animals much
cheaper than the vet.

06:36.601 --> 06:40.601
He claimed that Elisa had
been torturing her cat.

06:40.761 --> 06:43.161
Goddamn critter-lover.

06:44.321 --> 06:48.521
Who does the blue car belong to?
- It's mine.

06:48.681 --> 06:51.921
There's a dog inside, and
the windows are closed.

06:52.081 --> 06:55.041
The sun isn't even shining.
- Nevertheless.

06:56.161 --> 06:58.721
I'm leaving in a minute. - Okay.

06:59.721 --> 07:02.721
I heard you euthanize animals.
- I do.

07:04.361 --> 07:09.321
That dog needs to be put down.
- If he's suffering, bring him to me.

07:14.161 --> 07:19.401
'If he's suffering, bring him to me.'
Does he think he's fucking Jesus?

07:30.441 --> 07:37.001
Tuomas, Jari finished the logo.
It looks nice.

07:37.961 --> 07:40.961
Look. - Looks fucking great!

07:41.121 --> 07:43.281
Doesn't it? Temppu, look.

07:45.801 --> 07:50.521
I was wondering if it
should be in English?

07:50.681 --> 07:54.641
Soldiers of Finland?
- That's too hard to pronounce.

07:54.801 --> 07:57.361
The monkeys might
understand it better.

08:01.321 --> 08:05.801
No. It sounds too much like Tom of Finland.
- True.

08:05.961 --> 08:10.401
The skull should tell them we're
not ones to be fucked with.

08:10.561 --> 08:13.281
Go ahead and get it printed.
It's fine the way it is.

08:13.441 --> 08:15.921
Okay, I'll do it right away.

08:24.361 --> 08:26.921
You're late.
- I had to pick up the mutt.

08:27.081 --> 08:30.201
Why couldn't your old lady do it?
- She's at work.

08:30.361 --> 08:33.361
That dog looks so stupid,
it must be a nigger.

08:35.481 --> 08:40.441
I can't bring you any more. The
boss is getting suspicious.

08:40.601 --> 08:44.241
There are only six tyres.
- I couldn't get any more.

08:44.921 --> 08:47.761
I'll pay you a hundred.
- I need more.

08:48.721 --> 08:51.241
What am I gonna do
with six tyres?

08:51.401 --> 08:54.561
Change them in a car and a half?
- 150.

08:54.721 --> 09:00.401
Like hell. You'll get the rest when
you bring the two missing tyres.

09:00.561 --> 09:02.201
I'll try.

09:04.161 --> 09:08.201
That mutt is proof that mixing
races leads to no good.

09:10.401 --> 09:14.561
Mussu!
- What? Did you call it Mussu?

09:15.321 --> 09:17.241
I didn't name her!

09:20.241 --> 09:23.361
Alright. Ride on.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.081
Great, thanks!
- Don't mention it. Bye!

09:39.281 --> 09:41.081
What's wrong with your dog?

09:41.241 --> 09:47.121
I don't know exactly, but I'm
not paying any more to the vet.

09:48.201 --> 09:49.361
To Ojala.

09:49.521 --> 09:53.521
I've spent a thousand euros,
and there's no end in sight.

10:17.001 --> 10:19.361
Are you a dog whisperer
or something?

10:19.521 --> 10:22.961
Hush! He has something
to tell you.

10:26.561 --> 10:29.241
He wants to thank you.

10:29.401 --> 10:32.761
'Thank you for buying
me from a puppy mill.'

10:32.921 --> 10:36.881
'You supported their business and
made sure that, in the future -

10:37.041 --> 10:40.361
there will be more inbred
and overbred dogs -

10:40.521 --> 10:43.401
suffering from
hereditary diseases.'

10:43.561 --> 10:45.441
What the fuck are you saying?

10:45.601 --> 10:49.561
Not me, but your dog. Are you
saying that your dog is lying?

10:49.721 --> 10:53.681
I'm not going to argue with a dog!
- Of course not.

10:53.841 --> 10:57.401
Then you would have to take
responsibility for your actions.

10:57.561 --> 11:00.241
Are you putting
him down or not'?

11:01.721 --> 11:06.961
Yes. But it will cost you.
- How much?

11:07.121 --> 11:11.761
Normally I charge a hundred
euros, but for you, it's free.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.481
If you get inside
the dog's crate.

11:17.721 --> 11:20.361
Is this one of your
famous lessons?

11:20.521 --> 11:26.801
Just get in the crate.
- And the euthanasia will be free?

11:35.961 --> 11:37.641
Fuck, why not?

11:48.481 --> 11:51.921
What the fuck are you doing? Let
me out of here, motherfucker!

11:52.081 --> 11:55.881
Hey! Let me out of here!

12:37.921 --> 12:44.641
Where... Hey! Let me out!
Open the fucking door!

12:50.801 --> 12:54.321
You can't do something like that!
- That's what you've been doing.

12:54.481 --> 12:56.841
You can't treat people
the same as dogs.

12:57.001 --> 13:01.241
You're right. I can shoot your
dog in the head, but not you.

13:01.401 --> 13:03.001
Motherfucker...

13:10.401 --> 13:14.921
Get the fuck down!
Don't climb in here!

13:17.241 --> 13:21.201
Are you fucking kidding me?
Three hundred euros?

13:21.361 --> 13:24.441
This goddamn mutt didn't
even cost that much.

13:26.521 --> 13:29.081
Hello. What seems to
be the problem here?

13:29.241 --> 13:32.481
Three hundred for spaying a dog.

13:32.641 --> 13:38.961
Do you understand what kind of a
procedure spaying a bitch is?

13:39.121 --> 13:41.761
No, I don't!
- It is very complicated.

13:41.921 --> 13:45.081
Whatever! I didn't come
for a medical lecture -

13:45.241 --> 13:47.481
but to get the dog spayed!
- Relax...

13:47.641 --> 13:49.921
I'll relax when I'm
good and ready!

13:50.081 --> 13:54.521
Leave the premises or we'll call the
police. - Drink piss, you bitch!

13:54.681 --> 13:59.081
Call the police.
- Fuck! I wouldn't go in there!

13:59.241 --> 14:02.001
Don't go in there! - Bye-bye!

14:07.761 --> 14:12.001
What are these doing here?!
These are not allowed here.

14:19.081 --> 14:22.001
Jesus motherfucking Christ!

14:22.161 --> 14:26.161
Get in the fucking car!
Goddammit!

14:30.681 --> 14:32.281
Hi!

14:33.521 --> 14:36.841
The fucking dog just ran
off and was hit by a car!

14:37.921 --> 14:40.801
No, she's not alright. She died!

14:41.601 --> 14:44.321
What was I supposed to do?

14:45.441 --> 14:48.801
Don't cry on the
goddamn phone...

14:49.841 --> 14:53.041
I need to go and
bury the dog now!

14:53.201 --> 14:54.881
Bye.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.681
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.

17:12.881 --> 17:15.961
So you're the one who brings
the lilies-of-the-valley.

17:16.121 --> 17:19.721
It's so nice for Martti to
have fresh flowers in here.

17:21.281 --> 17:23.761
My father loves
lilies-of-the-valley.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.521
Do you think you can
eat by yourself?

17:31.521 --> 17:34.201
Would you like to feed him?
- Yes.

17:42.481 --> 17:44.561
Alright, open up.

17:46.841 --> 17:50.961
Well? Don't you like your
food without schnapps?

18:03.001 --> 18:05.841
Could you replace the
flowers with fresh ones?

18:06.001 --> 18:09.801
I can pay you for your trouble.
- Of course I can do that.

18:09.961 --> 18:14.321
You don't have to pay me. They
grow along my way to work.

18:19.721 --> 18:22.241
Haukka's Repairs
and End Solutions.

18:24.481 --> 18:27.001
Yes, I euthanize animals, too.

18:29.161 --> 18:31.761
I'll be there in half an hour.

18:32.761 --> 18:36.201
I gotta go. See you later.

18:37.281 --> 18:39.161
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:55.921 --> 18:57.521
Hi there.

18:58.841 --> 19:01.937
Are you the one who called me?
- Yeah.

19:01.961 --> 19:03.841
This dog needs putting down.

19:05.121 --> 19:07.881
Why? - She's not
right in the head.

19:08.041 --> 19:11.881
She's completely untrainable.
She is too wild to be a pet.

19:20.321 --> 19:22.081
She doesn't look like it.

19:22.241 --> 19:26.481
She bit my kids. I'll give you
40 euros if you kill her.

19:26.641 --> 19:30.081
Why don't you put
her down yourself?

19:30.241 --> 19:33.481
I'll pay you a hundred
euros to kill the dog.

19:33.641 --> 19:37.761
If my money's no good, give me a
hammer and I'll do it myself.

19:39.681 --> 19:41.921
Dogs are like people.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.841
They're aggressive if they don't
know their place in the world.

19:46.001 --> 19:48.961
They suffer from it and
pass their pain to others.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.481
There's always a
reason for pain.

19:52.521 --> 19:55.441
In this case, the
reason might be you.

19:57.361 --> 20:00.681
I didn't come here to
listen to your lecture!

20:00.841 --> 20:04.521
You came here to buy a 'get
out of having a dog' card.

20:05.841 --> 20:09.321
Are you giving me the hammer
or taking the 100 euros?

20:14.361 --> 20:16.161
150 euros.

20:19.121 --> 20:20.721
Done.

20:57.321 --> 20:58.921
Good girl.

21:03.321 --> 21:06.041
You haven't bitten anyone.

21:24.441 --> 21:26.961
I wonder what your
name might be?

21:30.081 --> 21:35.961
Mind if I call you Piki? Piki...

21:42.561 --> 21:46.761
I'll go get you some food.
What do you like?

21:48.241 --> 21:51.001
Kibbles? Yeah!

21:55.521 --> 21:57.161
Stay-

21:58.601 --> 21:59.801
Good!

22:04.921 --> 22:07.921
Damn, Why'd they have to
make this so difficult?

22:18.401 --> 22:22.041
Hey! Don't bring
these to my clinic.

22:22.201 --> 22:26.641
You've changed cars again.
- I'll report you to the police.

22:26.801 --> 22:29.921
What were you going to report?
Advertising?

22:30.081 --> 22:34.001
You take dogs into the forest
and shoot them in the head.

22:34.161 --> 22:37.081
That's not illegal.
- It's still not right.

22:37.241 --> 22:41.521
Who are you to tell me
about right and wrong?

22:41.681 --> 22:46.241
I've seen many of the
animals you have 'treated'.

22:46.401 --> 22:48.241
You don't care about them.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.881
You just care about getting
a new car every six months.

23:14.001 --> 23:16.081
Piki, quiet!

23:16.241 --> 23:18.161
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

23:21.161 --> 23:23.921
I brought this guinea
pig to be put down.

23:32.601 --> 23:34.641
Has he been living alone?

23:37.521 --> 23:40.921
Guinea pigs need a companion.
- He didn't have one.

23:42.281 --> 23:45.121
He's not my pet, but
my goddaughter's.

23:46.881 --> 23:51.281
Tell your goddaughter that her
guinea pig had a sad life.

24:17.001 --> 24:22.881
Why this song?
- What song would you like to die to?

24:49.281 --> 24:52.401
There's always a certain
beauty to the end of pain.

25:11.121 --> 25:13.521
What do I owe you? - Nothing.

25:16.801 --> 25:21.601
What's that?
- Lime. Helps with the decomposition.

25:31.601 --> 25:33.561
Bye then!

26:33.721 --> 26:35.761
Good morning, Martti.

26:37.921 --> 26:39.441
How are we doing?

26:41.681 --> 26:43.641
Are you in pain?

26:50.121 --> 26:52.321
We should get you changed.

27:16.481 --> 27:18.161
All done.

27:54.681 --> 27:59.561
Tell me, Vatanen. Being such a
stud, have you ever fucked a man?

28:03.001 --> 28:05.641
Not properly.

28:07.761 --> 28:10.201
Look! That fucker has a dog.

28:10.361 --> 28:13.401
In a leash! Torturer!

28:13.561 --> 28:19.081
Did you hear what the dog said?
He told you to go fuck yourself!

28:20.601 --> 28:23.681
Who's this, then? - Piki.

28:23.841 --> 28:26.121
He looks like my employee's dog.

28:26.281 --> 28:29.921
Some idiot brought her to be
put down for no reason at all.

28:30.081 --> 28:34.401
Sounds like Petri. I never had
you pegged as a dog owner.

28:34.561 --> 28:39.401
I was going to give her away, but
she might end up in a bad home.

28:39.561 --> 28:45.641
Veijo, you're getting soft. Soon,
you'll even start liking people.

28:52.081 --> 28:57.601
Guys, the shirts are here!
Check them out.

28:59.081 --> 29:00.921
Fucking awesome.

29:06.721 --> 29:09.241
Your old lady has you
cleaning now, too?

29:09.401 --> 29:12.721
The vacuum seems to fit
naturally in Petri's hand.

29:14.681 --> 29:16.321
The little maid.

29:16.481 --> 29:21.601
Now that your nigger was hit by a car,
did you become the new house nigger?

29:22.121 --> 29:25.361
The dog wasn't hit by a car!

29:25.521 --> 29:28.241
I bashed her head in
with a tyre iron!

29:28.401 --> 29:31.561
Brains splattering
all over the place!

29:32.081 --> 29:35.561
That's what happens when you fuck with me!
I'll kill you!

29:36.081 --> 29:39.121
Kill? Why didn't you hit
your old lady instead?

29:39.281 --> 29:41.401
She's next on my list!

29:47.361 --> 29:50.801
Here, have a shirt.
Nigger killer.

29:59.081 --> 30:01.881
Thanks, guys. - Back to work!

30:04.441 --> 30:05.521
Right!

30:28.121 --> 30:29.521
Hi.

30:31.921 --> 30:34.481
Who's this? - I found him.

30:51.321 --> 30:53.001
Fine.

30:53.161 --> 30:55.961
What did you see? - Enough.

31:10.401 --> 31:12.601
Wanna come?

31:21.601 --> 31:24.401
How many animals
have you put down?

31:38.401 --> 31:40.401
Cover your ears.

32:08.081 --> 32:10.281
Would you like to
go out with me?

32:13.481 --> 32:16.081
Like as a man and a woman?
- Yes.

32:19.161 --> 32:21.241
I don't want any children.

32:22.321 --> 32:24.841
Idiot.

32:25.001 --> 32:29.641
I wanted to make it clear right away.
- Will you?

32:35.201 --> 32:38.201
I go for drives in the evenings.

32:42.201 --> 32:45.841
Would you like to come?
- I would.

33:05.601 --> 33:10.041
If you do this right, we
might let you join us.

33:13.081 --> 33:17.801
If you do it well, we
might let you join us.

33:18.281 --> 33:22.161
Join us. But if you don't...

33:32.441 --> 33:34.081
You fucking hippie.

33:34.241 --> 33:37.721
You snitched me out to Vatanen.
- About what?

33:37.881 --> 33:41.881
You redo the inventory and
find the missing tyres!

33:42.681 --> 33:45.161
Find them where?
- I don't give a fuck!

33:45.321 --> 33:47.161
You need to fix it.

33:47.321 --> 33:50.561
If you do it well, you
might get into our gang.

33:52.241 --> 33:57.281
If you don't, you're going
to have to deal with us.

34:01.161 --> 34:03.641
Remember that.

34:06.921 --> 34:08.681
Right...

35:17.921 --> 35:20.361
Bring the lime.

35:27.321 --> 35:30.761
Do you do this every night?
- Oh, no.

35:32.281 --> 35:35.561
On Sundays, I watch TV.

35:40.161 --> 35:42.321
Pour some lime in there.

36:28.121 --> 36:32.561
Choke me.
- What? Are you serious?

36:32.721 --> 36:36.561
Go on, don't be shy. Choke me!

36:39.401 --> 36:41.521
- Like this?
- Yeah.

38:12.161 --> 38:17.361
Fuck. Now that was a lay!
- Sorry. I didn't mean to.

38:21.481 --> 38:25.161
Next time, take it
a little easier.

38:58.841 --> 39:01.081
Hiya. - How's it hanging?

39:01.241 --> 39:04.961
Ready to go? - I need to take
the kids to their grandma's.

39:05.121 --> 39:09.041
I'll be quick, it's on the way.
- Wanna watch that one?

39:11.721 --> 39:13.321
Hey, look.

39:13.481 --> 39:15.681
Daddy, that's Mussu!

39:15.841 --> 39:18.721
That's not Mussu. - Mussu!

39:18.881 --> 39:21.281
That's not Mussu! Goddammit!

39:21.441 --> 39:24.601
Get in the car, now!

39:25.761 --> 39:27.761
And put your phones away!

39:32.201 --> 39:35.761
Why is the dog still alive?
- What's it to you?

39:35.921 --> 39:39.441
You're no longer
responsible for this dog.

39:39.601 --> 39:45.401
My kids think I'm lying to them.
- Then you shouldn't have lied.

39:45.561 --> 39:49.121
You owe me to kill off that dog.

39:49.281 --> 39:51.441
I don't owe you anything.

39:51.601 --> 39:54.721
You owe me 150 euros for
a job you didn't do -

39:54.881 --> 39:57.161
and 400 for the dog you stole.

39:57.321 --> 40:00.721
Can you handle him?
- I can handle this!

40:01.281 --> 40:05.561
You will pay me five
hundred or kill the dog.

40:09.081 --> 40:11.441
What's going on here?

40:12.641 --> 40:14.361
This isn't over.

40:15.361 --> 40:18.721
You should have bashed his
head with your tyre iron.

40:20.601 --> 40:23.121
I need to talk to
you in private.

40:25.841 --> 40:28.321
Why was Mussu with that man?

40:28.481 --> 40:31.361
That wasn't our Mussu.

40:31.521 --> 40:34.241
And we are never
mentioning this again.

40:34.401 --> 40:38.161
Don't say anything to Mommy, and
you will both get guinea pigs.

40:38.321 --> 40:41.761
I don't like guinea pigs.
- There are other kinds.

40:42.721 --> 40:45.521
Mice or hamsters or...

40:46.721 --> 40:48.401
A pony is too big.

40:54.641 --> 40:59.401
You being Vatanen of the
Thousand Vaginas...

41:02.401 --> 41:04.521
Well? Ask away.

41:04.681 --> 41:08.641
Have you come across
erotic asphyxiation?

41:09.921 --> 41:12.281
Sure I have.

41:12.441 --> 41:15.321
Women these days, they
want to try everything.

41:15.481 --> 41:19.921
I'm not a fan myself. Are
you hoping to try it?

41:21.001 --> 41:26.081
No... This woman wants
me to choke her.

41:29.841 --> 41:34.841
Not another critter-lover who
thinks you're an idealist?

41:35.881 --> 41:37.921
She's not an activist.

41:40.321 --> 41:42.881
Hot damn, you're not
in love, are you?

41:45.001 --> 41:48.401
I thought your heart
only beats for animals.

41:50.001 --> 41:52.281
She is a bit of an animal.

41:53.841 --> 41:57.721
Well, just be sure to listen to
her while you are choking her.

41:57.881 --> 42:03.161
And gently, buddy. Gently.

42:14.561 --> 42:16.841
So there you go.

42:28.881 --> 42:30.721
Hi.

42:37.001 --> 42:41.641
What do you feel like doing?
Wanna go for a meal?

42:43.321 --> 42:48.041
I'm not hungry. - Neither am I.

43:33.041 --> 43:38.241
How will I know to let go?
- I'll tap on your shoulder.

43:52.801 --> 43:54.881
Again!

44:14.841 --> 44:18.281
Do you live here? - No.

44:23.721 --> 44:29.641
You must like motorcycles a lot.
- These aren't mine.

44:40.721 --> 44:44.041
I've been taking
lilies-of-the-valley to your dad.

44:48.681 --> 44:50.441
Good.

44:55.681 --> 44:58.401
He's in a lot of pain.

45:01.241 --> 45:04.321
Is that why you don't
visit him anymore?

45:05.441 --> 45:08.201
Because you hate
to see him suffer?

45:17.761 --> 45:20.121
Piki needs walking.

46:09.161 --> 46:11.841
Aren't you hungry?

46:12.001 --> 46:16.641
My wife died while picking
lingonberries in the forest.

46:16.801 --> 46:19.281
Some sort of a seizure.

46:24.921 --> 46:30.761
Maisa must have been upset that
the bucket was only half full...

46:34.841 --> 46:41.841
After that, it was
just me and Veijo.

46:53.401 --> 46:55.521
Can I have some morphine?

47:04.641 --> 47:07.441
Would you like to
listen to some music?

47:28.081 --> 47:31.881
Alright! Hi there! Can
you service my car?

47:34.201 --> 47:35.801
What do you need?

47:35.961 --> 47:39.481
I need an oil change before
my fishing trip to Tenojoki.

47:39.641 --> 47:44.681
What do you fish for?
- Salmon on this trip...

47:44.841 --> 47:48.881
Here, I'll show you.
Photos from my last trip.

47:53.241 --> 47:56.961
See this? That was
one feisty fellow...

47:58.721 --> 48:03.177
That's quite a hefty meal.
- I don't eat them, I release them.

48:03.201 --> 48:05.121
You know, catch and release.

48:05.281 --> 48:08.241
So you've been torturing
the fish for fun.

48:08.401 --> 48:11.721
Dragging them upstream with
a hook through their jaw.

48:11.881 --> 48:14.401
How do you think the fish felt?

48:14.561 --> 48:17.521
That it's great to be
in a selfie with you?

48:18.921 --> 48:20.521
What, are you crazy?

48:20.681 --> 48:24.201
The fish don't have that kind
of sensation in the jaw.

48:25.001 --> 48:28.361
Fuck! Hey, stop!

48:28.521 --> 48:31.401
Hey, don't! What the hell?

48:32.641 --> 48:34.801
Damned torturer!

48:47.201 --> 48:49.441
Okay now, look at me.

48:56.361 --> 48:58.441
Now you are released!

49:03.601 --> 49:05.241
Oh, yeah...

49:08.841 --> 49:11.481
Do you still want me
to change your oil?

49:13.601 --> 49:16.081
Fuck you!

49:19.961 --> 49:21.561
Hello?

49:41.361 --> 49:45.161
Dad! You can't die yet!
Do you hear me?

49:45.881 --> 49:48.041
Why aren't you
resuscitating him?

49:48.201 --> 49:52.081
He had a living will.
It included a DNR.

49:52.241 --> 49:55.601
I'm his son and I order
you to resuscitate him!

49:55.761 --> 49:58.921
He has already been
dead for half an hour.

50:02.121 --> 50:04.161
My condolences.

50:14.281 --> 50:16.601
Martti isn't suffering anymore.

50:45.801 --> 50:49.481
He was just crying and staring
at the flowers every day.

50:50.041 --> 50:52.841
That was the idea.

51:01.921 --> 51:04.441
Veijo, wait!

51:05.201 --> 51:07.321
You don't fucking get it!

51:07.481 --> 51:11.041
Everyone has to pay for the
pain that they've caused.

51:11.761 --> 51:16.241
My father hadn't finished
paying his debt yet!

51:16.401 --> 51:21.521
I thought you wanted to help.
- Pain needs to be balanced.

52:03.841 --> 52:07.801
- Petri!
- Yeah?

52:09.601 --> 52:12.201
Please put the cigarette away.

52:16.481 --> 52:18.081
So?

52:19.201 --> 52:22.801
Did you tell Jomppe to
falsify the numbers?

52:23.841 --> 52:28.041
What? Of course not!
- Did you threaten Jomppe?

52:28.201 --> 52:33.041
Told him to find the
missing tyres somewhere?

52:33.201 --> 52:35.761
What are you thinking?

52:35.921 --> 52:40.721
The guy stole them himself and
is trying to get away with it.

52:40.881 --> 52:45.841
Petri, if we were to open the
trunk of your car right now -

52:46.001 --> 52:48.921
what would we find?
- There's nothing there!

52:49.081 --> 52:52.361
Show me.
- I'm not showing you anything!

52:56.161 --> 52:58.201
- Get out.
- What?

52:58.361 --> 53:01.561
Get out. - Are you firing me?

53:01.721 --> 53:04.961
You can't. I have worked
here for five years...

53:05.121 --> 53:09.881
Get the fuck out of here!
- We don't forget.

53:10.721 --> 53:13.961
Soldiers of Finland
never forget!

53:17.801 --> 53:19.401
Fuck!

53:36.961 --> 53:38.561
Hey.

53:41.881 --> 53:45.481
Kids make stuff up all the time.

53:46.641 --> 53:50.201
The dog looked similar,
but it wasn't our Mussu.

53:52.721 --> 53:57.521
How do I know? Because I
buried the damn mutt!

53:58.761 --> 54:01.201
Are you calling me a liar?

54:04.641 --> 54:07.961
No, I won't come home
to talk about this!

54:08.121 --> 54:11.961
I'm going to see my brothers!
They at least appreciate me!

54:13.041 --> 54:15.041
No, I don't know
when I'll be home!

54:15.201 --> 54:17.641
I'll come when I feel like
it, if I feel like it!

54:17.801 --> 54:19.641
If ever!

54:44.681 --> 54:46.281
Hi, guys!

54:48.721 --> 54:50.721
Are you taking a break?

54:51.561 --> 54:55.361
We have new threads for the
nigger killer. -A hoodie?

54:59.721 --> 55:01.241
Temppu!

55:14.201 --> 55:18.601
We figured that you might as
well wear a skirt from now on.

55:22.641 --> 55:24.441
Fucking hell!

55:25.201 --> 55:28.681
You bullshitting bitch.
- Guys, please. I just got fired.

55:29.521 --> 55:31.681
You've got money. - What money?

55:31.841 --> 55:35.441
You sold your mutt to the
old man for 550 euros.

55:35.921 --> 55:38.081
Put the skirt on, bitch.

55:39.521 --> 55:41.321
We'll see who's the bitch.

55:46.601 --> 55:49.561
Goddamn motherfucker!

55:55.721 --> 55:59.241
You keyed my car!
- You, fuck off!

55:59.401 --> 56:01.721
Don't you threaten me.

56:01.881 --> 56:05.161
I'm calling the police and
you're paying for the paint job.

56:06.681 --> 56:10.001
What the fuck? You maniac,
this was a brand new phone!

56:10.161 --> 56:12.441
What's that? - I don't know.

56:12.601 --> 56:15.521
What is that?
- What does that matter?

56:15.681 --> 56:19.721
Did you hit an animal with your car?
- What does that matter?

56:21.161 --> 56:24.161
Did you hit an animal?

56:24.321 --> 56:28.841
Did you hit an animal?
What did you hit?!

56:29.881 --> 56:34.161
I guess it was a badger or something.
- Did it die?

56:34.321 --> 56:38.281
Well... Yes, it did.
- Are you sure? I don't believe you.

57:00.561 --> 57:02.681
It was over there.

57:07.881 --> 57:09.521
Get out.

57:17.161 --> 57:19.721
It was right here.

57:20.801 --> 57:23.241
It's wounded.

57:23.401 --> 57:26.441
It could have been taken
by some other animal.

57:27.881 --> 57:30.961
I see blood. Let's go that way.

57:31.121 --> 57:35.401
They are probably
missing me at work.

57:35.561 --> 57:38.681
You don't have to pay
for the paint job.

57:39.961 --> 57:41.841
Get on all fours, goddammit!

57:43.161 --> 57:44.761
What do you want?

57:47.001 --> 57:52.601
What do you want? For
me to say I was wrong?

57:52.761 --> 57:54.921
That I have been selfish -

57:55.081 --> 57:59.521
and haven't always thought about
what's best for the animal? What?!

58:02.841 --> 58:05.201
What if we can't find it?

58:09.721 --> 58:11.321
It's over there.

58:17.481 --> 58:22.321
It's dead.
- But he didn't die instantly.

58:22.481 --> 58:27.761
He suffered because of you.
- I'm sorry. I thought it died.

58:27.921 --> 58:29.721
Tell him you're sorry!

58:36.001 --> 58:40.121
I'm sorry for hitting
you with my car.

58:41.681 --> 58:45.441
I'm sorry for not stopping to
see what happened. I'm sorry.

58:48.361 --> 58:49.961
Bury him.

58:50.921 --> 58:52.641
Bury him!

59:06.121 --> 59:08.121
Do you believe in karma?

59:13.961 --> 59:16.161
My father didn't.

59:20.121 --> 59:24.081
He thought nothing
really mattered -

59:24.241 --> 59:28.401
and you could do anything you
liked without consequences.

59:40.121 --> 59:42.401
I disagree.

59:56.441 --> 59:59.641
I may have overreacted a little.

01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:24.321
- What now?
- Hit me.

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:29.481
- Hit me!
- No, I won't.

01:00:29.641 --> 01:00:31.481
Hit me!

01:02:47.001 --> 01:02:48.601
Hi there.

01:02:50.441 --> 01:02:53.601
Could you come get Piki and
take care of her for a while?

01:02:56.161 --> 01:03:00.201
Yes, of course. I can
come by after work.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:05.521
Where are you going?

01:03:07.441 --> 01:03:09.521
Vacation.

01:03:57.521 --> 01:04:00.321
Don't die yet, critter-lover!

01:04:05.721 --> 01:04:08.561
- Come on...
- Let me go!

01:04:08.721 --> 01:04:12.241
What do you want?
- For you to pay your debt.

01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:19.641
550 euros, get it?!
- I'm not giving you anything.

01:04:28.041 --> 01:04:30.001
Goddammit!

01:04:39.121 --> 01:04:44.121
I'll kill the dog, if you don't pay!
- No way! Goddamn punk.

01:04:56.641 --> 01:04:58.561
This is your last chance.

01:04:58.721 --> 01:05:02.121
Pay what you owe me,
or I'll burn this dog!

01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:07.881
Alright! I'll pay you!

01:05:08.921 --> 01:05:12.641
I've got money inside.
- Let's go and see.

01:05:18.641 --> 01:05:20.961
Where is it? - Over there.

01:05:26.761 --> 01:05:29.081
Antti! You look.

01:05:34.641 --> 01:05:37.361
He has a gun in here.
- You tried to screw us over.

01:05:37.521 --> 01:05:39.641
There's money in there, too!

01:05:43.521 --> 01:05:45.121
Outside.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:55.201
You motherfucker. You
tried to kill us!

01:05:57.281 --> 01:05:59.681
- Is there enough cash?
- Yeah.

01:05:59.841 --> 01:06:02.481
What do we do with this bitch?

01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:05.481
Kill the dog.

01:07:20.041 --> 01:07:23.001
Sure stopped the critter-lover
from running his mouth.

01:07:23.161 --> 01:07:27.401
Damn, that smell was terrible!
- I filmed it. Wanna see?

01:07:27.561 --> 01:07:31.321
I wonder if he'll call the police?
- He hasn't got the guts.

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:36.761
I feel so powerful!

01:07:36.921 --> 01:07:40.841
Altogether now...

01:07:41.001 --> 01:07:47.041
Soldiers of Finland!
Soldiers of Finland!

01:07:57.401 --> 01:08:01.561
What's happened?
- Get the shovel.

01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:23.041
<i>Take this star belt off my
waist Stay until tomorrow</i>

01:08:23.201 --> 01:08:26.640
<i>With a spirit of fire,
creating the world</i>

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:29.720
<i>Won't take as much sorrow</i>

01:08:29.881 --> 01:08:33.640
<i>Stay with me another night...</i>

01:08:34.321 --> 01:08:36.680
Your father wanted to
tell you he's sorry.

01:08:36.841 --> 01:08:41.481
<i>Go ahead and love me 'Cause
I've come to love you</i>

01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:50.041
<i>Look outside if you dare
People on their killing spree</i>

01:08:50.201 --> 01:08:56.680
<i>Underneath their blood-soaked wear
Lice are killing off the fleas</i>

01:08:56.841 --> 01:09:02.881
<i>Please be my humanity When
it's off on a killing spree</i>

01:09:03.041 --> 01:09:08.761
<i>Go ahead and love me 'Cause
I've come to love you</i>

01:09:08.921 --> 01:09:15.881
<i>And so you smile and look my
way Wake me up to a new day</i>

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:22.361
<i>So gently like the first
rain of the spring</i>

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:29.041
<i>You let me grab a hold of your
soul And carry us to the future</i>

01:09:29.201 --> 01:09:32.481
<i>And one of these morns
before the break of dawn</i>

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.401
<i>You see the colours form and the
- Dark sun rising!</i>

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:49.201
<i>Take this star belt off my waist
Simply let one more week go</i>

01:09:49.361 --> 01:09:56.561
<i>Our joy won't be ruined by haste
Won't be hit when worlds blow</i>

01:09:56.721 --> 01:10:03.081
<i>Eyes as tender as last night
Make a man put down his bow</i>

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:09.041
<i>Go ahead and love me 'Cause
I've come to love you!</i>

01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:16.041
<i>And so you smile and look my
way Wake me up to a new day</i>

01:10:16.201 --> 01:10:22.561
<i>So gently like the first
rain of the spring</i>

01:10:22.721 --> 01:10:29.721
<i>You let me grab a hold of your
soul And carry us to the future</i>

01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:33.441
<i>And one of these morns
before the break of dawn...</i>

01:10:39.681 --> 01:10:41.201
Guitar solo!

01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:46.321
Guys, this is the real deal!
Damn yeah!

01:10:50.801 --> 01:10:55.281
- You guys...
- Come on, now.

01:11:49.441 --> 01:11:51.721
Alright, gentlemen.

01:11:52.761 --> 01:11:54.721
What the fuck? - Shut up.

01:11:59.961 --> 01:12:01.561
To the garage.

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:14.321
Line up by the lift.

01:12:19.761 --> 01:12:22.041
You're fucking dead. - Shut up.

01:12:29.441 --> 01:12:34.281
For you two it will be enough to
remember Piki with your every step.

01:12:38.401 --> 01:12:40.081
No, don't...

01:12:58.001 --> 01:13:01.281
Ow, motherfucker!

01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:00.921
What do you want?

01:14:06.521 --> 01:14:09.081
What do you want?!

01:15:06.361 --> 01:15:09.801
It was a dog. A fucking animal!

01:15:20.841 --> 01:15:25.681
Wait, wait! Let's
talk about this!

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:34.201
What will happen to you if you kill me?
- What will happen to me?

01:15:48.321 --> 01:15:52.841
When I was 13, I had
to go to the hospital.

01:15:54.601 --> 01:15:58.081
Thanks to my dear late father.

01:15:58.241 --> 01:16:02.561
When I was finally released -

01:16:02.721 --> 01:16:09.801
I found my father passed out
among the lilies-of-the-valley.

01:16:10.601 --> 01:16:18.001
In the cattle shed, there were 40
starving bulls waiting for me.

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:22.641
It smelled of shit
and rotten flesh.

01:16:24.441 --> 01:16:29.921
I tried to get the vet to
come, but he was 'too busy.'

01:16:31.961 --> 01:16:38.201
I got my father's pistol and
returned to the cattle shed to kill.

01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:50.481
But I couldn't shoot them.

01:16:53.481 --> 01:16:59.761
So I got gasoline and
set the shed on fire.

01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:10.201
I've received my
sentence long ago.

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:18.681
Don't kill me...

01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:28.641
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:24.081
Veijo... Veijo?

01:19:43.801 --> 01:19:46.801
Would you like to
listen to some music?
