[ Whimpers ] Shh.

34:03.448 --> 34:05.499
It's okay. You're okay.

[ Crying ]
You're okay. You're okay.

34:07.619 --> 34:11.588
[ Sobs ]
You're okay. You're okay.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.572
I was already inside
before it occurred to me

34:15.672 --> 34:19.208
that the motorcycle outside
wasn't Bill's.

34:19.310 --> 34:24.581
Before I could do anything,
he grabbed my neck.

34:25.266 --> 34:26.815
He had a gun.

34:27.228 --> 34:28.587
Did he say anything?

34:29.460 --> 34:31.705
He said that
nobody would come to help me.

34:32.665 --> 34:34.353
You all were at The Red Pony.

34:34.780 --> 34:36.956
So the call to Henry
was a decoy.

34:38.237 --> 34:41.868
And then he asked me how much
I thought my life was worth.

34:43.926 --> 34:46.052
I told him
I'd give him whatever he wanted.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.353
How much money did he take?

34:48.472 --> 34:50.505
$500.

34:50.607 --> 34:53.192
But I don't think
that he cared about the money.

34:53.310 --> 34:55.360
He was enjoying himself.

34:55.478 --> 34:57.363
What did he look like?

34:57.481 --> 35:00.283
Was he a middle-aged guy,
short blond hair?

35:00.367 --> 35:05.371
[ Sighs ]
He was a kid, maybe 25, 26.

35:05.489 --> 35:08.407
He smelled like
he hadn't showered in days.

35:08.525 --> 35:11.827
And he had
a tattoo on his face.

35:14.131 --> 35:16.031
I want every train

Well, the good news is
your friend from Philly

35:31.598 --> 35:34.684
wasn't here
to kill Bill or Diane.

35:34.768 --> 35:36.385
Yeah, but the bad news is,

35:36.486 --> 35:40.156
I have no idea
what he was doing here.

35:49.449 --> 35:53.002
Got your phone? Vic: Yeah.

35:53.086 --> 35:57.373
That's the number of
that disposable cellphone.

35:57.457 --> 35:59.742
You don't think
he's gonna answer, do you?

35:59.843 --> 36:01.177
Nope.

Who the hell are you?

36:53.430 --> 36:55.097
Where did you get that phone?

36:55.182 --> 36:57.633
Some guy named zip. He said
he didn't need it anymore.

36:57.734 --> 37:00.069
Where is he? He left.

37:00.153 --> 37:01.470

Lock the door, Henry.

37:32.686 --> 37:35.304
Life is tale told by an idiot.

37:35.389 --> 37:37.523
Do you know who said that?

37:37.641 --> 37:41.610
Shakespeare.
"MacBeth," to be more specific.

37:41.695 --> 37:45.698
Yes. Well done.

37:45.816 --> 37:47.566
You know, Henry, I've, uh...

37:47.684 --> 37:50.352
I've been riding trains
all across this country

37:50.454 --> 37:52.238
for about the past three years,

37:52.355 --> 37:54.240
looking for
the meaning of life.

37:54.357 --> 37:55.708
It was a total waste of time.

Life... Is meaningless...

38:04.200 --> 38:08.421
Full of sound and fury
but signifying nothing.

38:08.538 --> 38:10.172
Bill Shakespeare
understood that,

38:10.257 --> 38:13.175
but it was Bill Norquist
who really opened my eyes.

38:13.260 --> 38:16.044
I mean, this guy shows up to me
out of nowhere

with a gun
and a simple proposition...

kill my wife for $2,000.

He showed me that,

38:22.152 --> 38:24.403
while life may not have
any meaning,

38:24.521 --> 38:26.021
it certainly has value.

what your life is worth.
