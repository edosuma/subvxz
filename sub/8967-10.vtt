rrator: This is the Evergreen

00:02.402 --> 00:03.803
rrator: This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.803 --> 00:06.239
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.874 --> 00:10.443
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.443 --> 00:11.945
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.580 --> 00:15.448
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.516 --> 00:17.751
Yikes!

00:17.751 --> 00:19.386
Yaaaah...

00:22.389 --> 00:23.690
Yeaaaah!

00:23.690 --> 00:26.659
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.636
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.937 --> 00:39.572
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.809 --> 00:45.412
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.146 --> 00:47.680
the Raccoons!!

00:47.680 --> 00:49.949
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.028 --> 01:03.229
Well?

01:03.229 --> 01:05.098
You're not
going to like this, Pop.

01:05.098 --> 01:07.233
But it seems you owe

01:07.233 --> 01:10.303
$400,000 in back taxes.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.572
$400,000!!!

01:12.572 --> 01:15.708
Did the pigs turn in
all their expense sheets?

01:15.708 --> 01:17.744
Gee Pop, I don't know.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.647
Where are those
lazy swine anyway?

01:20.647 --> 01:24.818
Pig 2: Now we can go back
in time and change things,

01:24.818 --> 01:26.553
Pig 3: It's fool proof.

01:26.553 --> 01:29.756
It must be,
if you pigs are using it.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.257
What is this thing, anyway?

01:31.257 --> 01:33.827
Pig 1: It's a
time machine, boss.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.262
Pig 3: The possibilities
are endless.

01:36.262 --> 01:39.265
Pig 1: Time travel could
make you a fortune!

01:39.265 --> 01:41.734
Hmmm.. time travel.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.436
Lemme see this thing...

01:43.436 --> 01:44.437
Oh.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.573
Eh! Hmm...

01:46.573 --> 01:49.275
Gee, I don't
know about this, Pop.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.611
How do you start
this contraption anyway?

01:51.611 --> 01:53.947
Pig 2: According to the manual
that came with the kit,

01:53.947 --> 01:56.816
uhm.. you just press these.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.490
Uh-oh!

02:08.461 --> 02:09.562
Pop!!

02:12.866 --> 02:15.802
Aaaah! Agh!

02:15.802 --> 02:18.037
Pig 2: Oooh!

02:18.037 --> 02:22.308
The time machine.
It works! It works!!

02:22.308 --> 02:25.078
Great! Now, let's
start making money!

02:25.078 --> 02:26.713
Computer T.O.M.: Hey!

02:26.713 --> 02:29.482
That's a real go getter attitude
you've got there, Cyril.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.483
Who said that?!

02:31.551 --> 02:33.786
T.O.M.: My card.
Tom?

02:33.786 --> 02:36.956
T.O.M.: That's me. Time
Observation Monitor.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.993
Time tripping, my speciality.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.396
Well, then if you run
this thing let's see it work.

02:43.396 --> 02:47.167
I need money! A king's ransom.
Wait a minute.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.471
Kings..knights..you can
change anything, right?

02:51.471 --> 02:53.907
T.O.M.: Whatever you say, Cyril.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.943
Then take me back to
the time the King and Queen

02:56.943 --> 02:59.245
were expected in
the Evergreen forest.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.080
Cyril/Pig: Uah!

03:05.285 --> 03:07.153
T.O.M.: This is the time
you wanted, Cyril.

03:07.153 --> 03:10.023
Rumour has it that the King and
Queen are visiting the forest.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.691
The royal family?

03:11.691 --> 03:13.326
How soon do they arrive?

03:13.326 --> 03:16.462
T.O.M.: Here's your main chance
to get back the knighthood

03:16.462 --> 03:18.965
lost by your
great-great-great uncle,

03:18.965 --> 03:21.034
Excalibur Sneer.

03:21.034 --> 03:25.171
Oh, this was a major
embarrassment in my life.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.839
T.O.M.: What's this?

03:26.839 --> 03:30.577
Bert Raccoon after
that same knighthood.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.880
Pig 2: There's only supposed
to be one knight per forest.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.982
T.O.M.: Absolutely.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.119
And just look at that mansion.

03:40.119 --> 03:42.388
By the looks of it,
you really expected to be

03:42.388 --> 03:44.891
that one particular knight.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.727
Of course I did.
Now get on with it!

03:47.727 --> 03:50.463
T.O.M.: Which is just
what Bert's doing.

03:50.463 --> 03:53.666
'Cause he knows that you
can't become a knight

03:53.666 --> 03:56.069
without a Rite of Passage.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.205
T.O.M.: He's got the sword...

04:02.375 --> 04:04.010
He's got the shield...

04:06.246 --> 04:08.448
He's got the hair
from a savage beast.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.723
T.O.M.: I'd say he's doing well.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.358
Who asked you?

04:21.027 --> 04:23.329
T.O.M.: And now he's got
the most precious thing

04:23.329 --> 04:25.031
in the Evergreen forest.

04:26.132 --> 04:28.401
That's it!
I've got it all!

04:28.401 --> 04:31.104
T.O.M.: Oops, no he doesn't.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.039
You've stolen it.

04:33.606 --> 04:37.210
Ah, no point in doing all the
work yourself, right Cyril?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.612
Pig 2: No. We usually do that.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.719
T.O.M.: And here it is.

04:46.719 --> 04:49.589
Cyril's big night!

04:49.589 --> 04:54.127
Come on down, Cyril Sneer!

04:54.127 --> 04:55.428
Where'd you get this

04:55.428 --> 04:57.597
trash-talking
time machine anyway??

04:57.597 --> 05:00.967
T.O.M.: Shhh. This is
my favourite part.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.636
Your stage debut, Cyril.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.072
You mean that
this is all a play?

05:06.072 --> 05:08.074
Ooh, that's your cue.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.510
My what?
Hey, stop pushing!

05:10.510 --> 05:12.078
Don't you realize, who I am?

05:13.946 --> 05:15.515
Oh! Ha-ha!

05:15.515 --> 05:17.950
Ah-ha! What brings you,

05:17.950 --> 05:20.520
fair knight to our forest?

05:20.520 --> 05:23.356
I was just in the neighborhood..I..I

05:23.356 --> 05:25.158
I just thought I'd drop by.

05:27.193 --> 05:28.828
Ooh!

05:32.765 --> 05:35.635
Hey,
what's
going on, guys?

05:37.603 --> 05:41.674
It's all been a big
misunderstanding, Bert.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.010
The King and Queen
aren't really coming.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.280
Ralph and Melissa are
just putting on a play.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.681
A play?!

05:48.681 --> 05:51.484
You mean, that
this was all a play?

05:51.484 --> 05:55.421
Whew. This could have
been embarrassing.

05:55.421 --> 05:59.058
It is! Look at Pop!

06:00.293 --> 06:02.795
My son..the traitor!

06:04.030 --> 06:05.264
Gentle, Sir!

06:06.899 --> 06:10.036
Have you brought a gift
for this great occasion?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.538
What?! Um...

06:12.538 --> 06:14.907
Yes, I've brought
with me the most

06:14.907 --> 06:16.943
precious object in the Kingdom.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.418
What the heck is it anyway?

06:27.887 --> 06:28.888
Ah!

06:29.856 --> 06:33.626
Peanut butter?! This is
a precious object?!!

06:33.626 --> 06:35.661
What in the blue blood is this?

06:42.869 --> 06:44.070
Put 'er in reverse.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.839
Stop it..right..here.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.074
Now get me in there.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.177
T.O.M.: Just step over on to
the transport plate, Cyril.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.413
I'm ready. Hit it!

07:01.954 --> 07:06.726
Uaaaaaaah!

07:07.126 --> 07:08.728
T.O.M.: Oooops!

07:19.539 --> 07:23.242
The quality of
money is not strained.

07:23.242 --> 07:27.046
It droppeth from heaven
on my place beneath.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.882
It blesseth him that takes

07:29.882 --> 07:31.684
and him that invests.

♪ (royal trumpet) ♪

07:36.823 --> 07:38.291
Your Majesty.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.960
I have come to the
Evergreen forest

07:40.960 --> 07:44.130
to reinstate the
good name of Sneer.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.433
Arise, Sir Cyril,

07:47.433 --> 07:49.702
Lord of the Evergreen forest,

07:49.702 --> 07:52.805
and owner of all
the lands therein.

Here are the deeds.

07:55.041 --> 07:58.077
Rule wisely and well.

Beam me up, now!

08:07.887 --> 08:10.690
Pig 2:
Oh, welcome back.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.992
Marvelous show, Sir.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.294
That's Sir! Sir, to you!

08:15.294 --> 08:16.963
T.O.M.: Time to go home, Cyril.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.898
I need my beauty rest.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.867
And by the looks
of things, so do you.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.837
Forget it. We're
taking another little trip.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.739
Pig 2: Oh, where to, boss?

08:26.739 --> 08:30.009
We're going to shut
down that rag of a newspaper

08:30.009 --> 08:33.145
those meddling Raccoons
love so much.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.281
I missed my chance before,

08:35.281 --> 08:37.283
but I won't miss this time...

08:37.283 --> 08:39.352
Not with my time machine!

08:43.890 --> 08:45.825
Who taught you to drive anyway?

08:45.825 --> 08:49.061
T.O.M.: Cyril, time is
a very delicate thing.

08:49.061 --> 08:51.597
Every time you change history,

08:51.597 --> 08:55.134
you set up shock waves
that affect the future.

08:55.134 --> 08:56.869
You just felt one.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.104
Are we there yet?

08:58.104 --> 09:00.907
T.O.M.: Yeah, Cyril,
here we go again.

09:02.942 --> 09:05.111
There you are, doing
what you do best...

09:05.111 --> 09:06.245
plotting.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.782
This time you're getting
Mr. Knox to help you buy up

09:09.782 --> 09:12.852
all the ink and
paper everywhere.

09:12.852 --> 09:16.856
just to shut down the
Evergreen Standard newspaper.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.693
Nasty plan, but nice logic.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.429
No paper. No paper!!

09:26.432 --> 09:29.468
T.O.M.: The first time around,
you made a deal to pay Knox

09:29.468 --> 09:32.238
in gold, even tough it would take

09:32.238 --> 09:33.806
everything you had. One,

09:33.806 --> 09:37.843
two, four, five, six...

09:37.843 --> 09:40.012
Um, you missed three.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.715
T.O.M.: Your biggest problem was
the deadline.

09:42.715 --> 09:46.652
Knox wanted it by
noon on the thirteenth.

09:46.652 --> 09:51.157
And you missed the
deadline, didn't you?

09:51.157 --> 09:54.393
The pigs thought your
gold count was low.

09:54.393 --> 10:00.199
They decided to help out by
making gold from a formula

10:00.199 --> 10:03.669
they found in one of your books.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.137
Very commendable.

10:05.137 --> 10:08.874
T.O.M.: However, an electrical
failure interrupted their work.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.578
Uaaaaaah!

10:12.578 --> 10:14.847
T.O.M.: So the decided to carry on

10:14.847 --> 10:17.583
at the top of Frean's Peak,

10:17.583 --> 10:21.253
using lightening to
power their experiment.

10:22.321 --> 10:26.959
Unknown to them, Bert Raccoon
had similar idea,

10:26.959 --> 10:30.463
but he hoped to make gold
to save the Standard,

10:30.463 --> 10:33.032
because he's a nice guy.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.470
Both experiments failed,

10:37.470 --> 10:40.673
but Bert ended up with the gold.

10:40.673 --> 10:43.042
Your gold, Cyril.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.343
My gold?!

10:44.343 --> 10:46.812
Pig 2: It-it was
an accident, boss.

10:46.812 --> 10:51.217
Ehm, ehm, the book said, we
needed gold to make gold.

10:51.217 --> 10:54.553
We got it back. Honest!

10:57.423 --> 11:01.127
T.O.M.: Well, here we are
at your press conference.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.462
You're announcing your, um...

11:03.462 --> 11:04.797
eh, takeover.

11:04.797 --> 11:08.300
So you're responsible
for our supplies being cut off?

11:08.300 --> 11:11.470
But Pop,
that's hardly nice.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.340
Nice?!
This is the nicest thing

11:14.340 --> 11:16.175
that's ever happened to me.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.078
Pigs, call Mr. Knox.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.847
Pig 1: Hello?

11:23.282 --> 11:24.617
Uh..really?

11:27.219 --> 11:28.454
Are you sure?!

11:30.456 --> 11:33.726
Heh-heh. Ok, bye.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.396
Who was that?
Pig 1: Uh, heh-eh...

11:37.396 --> 11:39.899
It was uh, Mr Knox's office.

11:39.899 --> 11:43.269
Eh, it seems you're a
little too late...

11:43.269 --> 11:46.772
Ya know, you pigs
are really revolting

11:46.772 --> 11:48.207
when you sweat like that.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.943
Pig 1: Uh, he-heh. Sorry, boss.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.947
You missed the deadline, Sir...

11:54.947 --> 11:57.016
They won't sell.

11:57.016 --> 11:59.852
What?! But
it isn't noon yet.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.520
He has to sell.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.191
Pig 1: They just told me
it's three minutes past.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.026
Three minutes past?

12:07.026 --> 12:08.494
How's that possible?

12:08.494 --> 12:10.029
Who set that clock?

12:10.029 --> 12:11.197
Who?!!

12:11.197 --> 12:13.733
Speak up..I'll make
an example of them.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.702
I..I.. I think,
you forget something, Pop...

12:17.770 --> 12:20.206
Um...

12:20.206 --> 12:22.808
Speak up.
What secret policy?

12:22.808 --> 12:25.177
Uh..maybe, I
shouldn't mention it

12:25.177 --> 12:27.480
in front of the employees?

12:30.649 --> 12:31.751
Blast them!!

12:31.751 --> 12:33.152
Tell me.

12:33.152 --> 12:36.689
Well Pop, you
rigged the clock years ago

12:36.689 --> 12:38.257
to be five minutes slow

12:38.257 --> 12:40.159
so you can get more
work out of them

12:40.159 --> 12:42.061

them for it...

12:42.061 --> 12:45.064
You must have forgotten.

12:47.299 --> 12:49.668
Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!

12:49.668 --> 12:51.370
T.O.M.: Step onto
the transporter pad,

12:51.370 --> 12:55.407
and we'll get this sordid
little deal over with.

12:55.407 --> 12:59.278
Just make sure, I get
that five minutes I need.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.693
Knox? It's me again.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.762
Do you still want
to make a deal?

13:16.762 --> 13:19.031
Great. Hang on.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.834
Well, I can make this
deal with Knox right now

13:21.834 --> 13:23.602
and shut down the
Evergreen Standard

13:23.602 --> 13:24.603
for good...

13:24.603 --> 13:27.173
Or.. I can take
over the paper,

13:27.173 --> 13:29.241
and you work for me.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.345
We'll
never work for you!

13:33.345 --> 13:36.115
Knox? Looks
like we've got a deal...

13:36.115 --> 13:37.583
No, wait!!

13:37.583 --> 13:41.220
We'll sign.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.889
Sorry Knox,
the deal's off.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.058
But let's do lunch..soon.

13:51.931 --> 13:56.402
T.O.M.: These time storms are
draining my energy reserves.

13:56.402 --> 13:59.572
If we don't go now,
we may never go.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.673
I'll risk it.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.809
Now, take me to when those
Raccoons cheated me out of

14:03.809 --> 14:06.545
a King's ransom
in pirate treasure.

14:07.947 --> 14:11.350

Well, get us out of it!

15:54.520 --> 15:56.755

T.O.M.: Yeah, we made it Cyril,

15:58.724 --> 16:00.526
but we may not
make it back again.

16:00.526 --> 16:01.527
Nonsense.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.096
You time machines
are always exaggerating.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.264
Let's get at it!

16:05.264 --> 16:06.799
T.O.M.: Okay, Cyril.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.670
The treasure hunt began when
Broo found a treasure map

16:11.670 --> 16:13.639
inside an old boot.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.009
Ah-ha! So, that's
where it came from.

Pig 2: Hi-hi, lucky we were
eavesdropping, right Sir?

16:23.682 --> 16:26.285
T.O.M.: Seems nothing
stops Bert and Cedric...

16:26.819 --> 16:28.954
Not even solid rock.

16:28.954 --> 16:32.691
That Raccoon must have
solid rock between his ears,

16:32.691 --> 16:35.427
if he thought I'd let him
get away with this one.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.297
T.O.M.: So you trailed
them into the cave

16:38.297 --> 16:41.633
and relieved Bert
and your own son

16:41.633 --> 16:43.802
of the treasure chest.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.638
Nice guy...

16:46.638 --> 16:47.906
I didn't steal it!

16:47.906 --> 16:50.342
The treasure was
buried on my land!

16:50.342 --> 16:53.946
T.O.M.: Uh huh.
The deed was a fake, Cyril.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.614
Ha! Details!

16:59.051 --> 17:00.919
Now, have a good time!

17:04.223 --> 17:08.527
T.O.M.: And here's that great
moment with the cave defenses.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.998
I mean, you should have figured
a treasure would be protected.

17:12.998 --> 17:16.168
You sure can move, Cyril baby.

17:16.168 --> 17:18.637
Ehh.. it seemed
like a good idea.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.712

I got my gold

Young Aardvark Summer Camp...

You put it in the

I lost my treasure
