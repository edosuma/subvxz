WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:03.504
GABY'S NEW TENANT...

00:03.504 --> 00:06.137
I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT
A ROOM TO RENT.
 WE LIKE YOU.

00:06.137 --> 00:08.479
IF YOU HAVE
FIRST AND LAST MONTHS' RENT,

00:08.479 --> 00:11.682
WE'D LIKE YOU EVEN MORE.
 ...CAME WITH
A DANGEROUS SECRET.

00:11.682 --> 00:15.015
I'M YOUR FATHER.
 WAYNE'S RETURN MEANT TROUBLE
FOR KATHERINE.

00:15.015 --> 00:19.150
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU,
BUT I DO.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.622
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE FIRE AT RICK'S RESTAURANT?

00:21.622 --> 00:23.794
LYNETTE TRIED TO WARN TOM
ABOUT KAYLA...

00:23.794 --> 00:27.728
I THINK WE HAVE
A SERIOUSLY TROUBLED YOUNG GIRL.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.660
AND IN HIS TIME OF WEAKNESS,

00:29.660 --> 00:35.366
ORSON CHOSE THE WRONG SHOULDER
TO CRY ON.

00:35.366 --> 00:37.138
I DON'T... THINK...

00:37.138 --> 00:39.039
YOU'RE RIGHT. (chuckles)

00:46.147 --> 00:49.650
(Mary Alice) THE INCIDENT--
AS IT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN--

00:49.650 --> 00:53.424
HAPPENED LATE
ON A TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

00:53.424 --> 00:57.728
WITNESSES INCLUDED
AN OLD WOMAN...

00:57.728 --> 01:01.332
A BLIND MAN...

01:03.194 --> 01:06.097
AND A YOUNG BOY.

01:06.097 --> 01:09.500
THE OLD WOMAN, WHOSE HEARING
WAS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE,

01:09.500 --> 01:12.072
SAW BREE HODGE
EMERGE FROM HER HOUSE

01:12.072 --> 01:14.074
IN A WAY THAT TOLD HER

01:14.074 --> 01:17.148
SHE WAS UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING.

01:17.148 --> 01:20.851
THE BLIND MAN, WHOSE HEARING
HAD BECOME MORE ACUTE,

01:20.851 --> 01:25.116
HEARD EDIE SAY...
 OH, HEY, BREE. WHAT'S UP?

01:25.116 --> 01:27.118
...IN A WAY THAT SUGGESTED

01:27.118 --> 01:29.790
EDIE WASN'T EXPECTING
ANY TROUBLE.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.793
THE YOUNG BOY,
WHO WAS NOT YET 11,

01:32.793 --> 01:34.565
HEARD BREE HODGE SAY...

01:34.565 --> 01:37.268
I SAW YOU
KISSING MY HUSBAND.

01:37.268 --> 01:39.130
BUT HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND

01:39.130 --> 01:42.173
WHY SOMEONE WOULD BE ANGRY
ABOUT KISSES,

01:42.173 --> 01:44.505
WHICH HE THOUGHT
GROWN-UPS LIKED.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.507
AS THE OLD WOMAN PRETENDED

01:46.507 --> 01:49.109
TO CLIP HEDGES
SHE'D ALREADY CLIPPED,

01:49.109 --> 01:53.614
SHE SAW THE BODY LANGUAGE
OF HER NEIGHBORS CHANGE.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.517
AS THE BLIND MAN LISTENED IN,

01:56.517 --> 01:58.289
HE HEARD BREE SAY...

01:58.289 --> 02:01.292
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, EDIE?
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS.

02:01.292 --> 02:04.155
WEAREFRIENDS.
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN ORSON.

02:04.155 --> 02:07.358
THE YOUNG BOY
THEN HEARD EDIE ADD...

02:07.358 --> 02:09.560
SO STOP ACTING
LIKE SUCH A BITCH!

02:09.560 --> 02:14.635
...WHICH INCLUDED A WORD
HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO USE.

02:14.635 --> 02:19.240
THE OLD WOMAN THEN SAW
BREE HODGE CLENCH HER FIST.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.842
A SECOND LATER,
THE BLIND MAN HEARD A SLAP...

02:21.842 --> 02:23.474
(slap)

02:23.474 --> 02:26.917
AND THE YOUNG BOY
SAW EDIE GRAB HER CHEEK.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.482
AS THE TWO WOMEN
PARTED COMPANY,

02:31.482 --> 02:33.184
A THOUGHT OCCURRED

02:33.184 --> 02:35.926
TO ALL THOSE WHO HAD
WITNESSED THE INCIDENT...

02:35.926 --> 02:40.231
THAT RIGHT THERE
ON PEACEFUL WISTERIA LANE,

02:40.231 --> 02:42.693
THE BATTLE LINES
HAD BEEN DRAWN,

02:42.693 --> 02:45.196
AND SOMEONE...

02:45.196 --> 02:58.649
WAS GOING TO GET HURT.

02:58.649 --> 03:02.913
IT HAPPENS
THE SECOND SUNDAY OF EVERY MAY.

03:02.913 --> 03:07.288
CHILDREN PURCHASE
TASTEFUL BOUQUETS...

03:07.288 --> 03:10.261
SIGN SENTIMENTAL CARDS...

03:10.261 --> 03:12.823
AND CREATE HOMEMADE JEWELRY...

03:12.823 --> 03:15.866
ALL IN AN ATTEMPT TO HONOR

03:15.866 --> 03:18.599
THAT WOMAN KNOWN SIMPLY...

03:18.599 --> 03:19.870
AS MOTHER.

03:19.870 --> 03:21.372
(laughs) OH!

03:21.372 --> 03:23.334
HEY, MAMA.
 (Southern accent) HEY, BABY.

03:23.334 --> 03:26.737
OH, MY GOSH!

03:26.737 --> 03:28.879
IS THIS MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW?

03:28.879 --> 03:30.241
(laughs)

03:30.241 --> 03:33.744
WELL, I'M GONNA HUG HER. OH!
 IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:33.744 --> 03:35.386
OH, MY GOODNESS! OH!

03:35.386 --> 03:37.548
OH, OKAY. (chuckles)

03:37.548 --> 03:39.720
OH, MY SON WAS RIGHT.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.623
YOU ARE THE PRETTIEST THING!

03:42.623 --> 03:45.556
MICHAEL,
I'M JUST TAKEN WITH HER.

03:45.556 --> 03:48.699
OH, WELL, GOOD. THANK YOU.
 COME ON, MAMA.
LET'S GET YOU UNPACKED.

03:48.699 --> 03:52.363
OH, YES, LET'S DO,
'CAUSE I BROUGHT YOU A PRESENT.
 OH! OH! (laughs)

03:52.363 --> 03:54.405
LET'S GO. COME ON.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.309
(giggles)

03:58.309 --> 04:00.871
WOW!

04:00.871 --> 04:03.944
(gasps) IT'S ALL RECIPES.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.516
NOT JUST ANY RECIPES.

04:05.516 --> 04:07.518
SOME OF THESE HAVE BEEN
IN MY FAMILY

04:07.518 --> 04:10.421
SINCE BEFORE
THE WAR OF NORTHERN AGGRESSION.

04:10.421 --> 04:13.354
YOU MEAN THE CIVIL WAR?

04:13.354 --> 04:15.986
I MEAN WHAT I MEAN.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.361
UM, WELL...

04:20.361 --> 04:22.363
I GUESS MIKE DIDN'T TELL YOU

04:22.363 --> 04:24.495
THAT I'M, UH,
REALLY NOT A COOK.

04:24.495 --> 04:26.497
OH, NO, HE TOLD ME.

04:26.497 --> 04:28.999
THAT'S WHY
I GAVE YOU THESE RECIPES,

04:28.999 --> 04:32.272
AND I'M GON' TEACH YOU
HOW TO MAKE 'EM, TOO.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.505
ISN'T THAT NICE, HONEY?

04:34.505 --> 04:36.507
OH,
MY MEEMAW ALWAYS TOLD ME

04:36.507 --> 04:39.410
THAT A LADY SHOULD BE
A CHEF IN THE KITCHEN,

04:39.410 --> 04:43.283
A MAID IN THE LIVING ROOM
AND A WHORE IN THE BEDROOM.
 (chuckles nervously)

04:43.283 --> 04:46.557
AND MICHAEL SAYS YOU'VE ONLY
GOT ONE OF THOSE COVERED,

04:46.557 --> 04:49.660
SO I'M GON' HELP YOU
WITH THE OTHER TWO.

04:49.660 --> 04:52.793
EXCUSE ME.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.029
(lowered voice) THE ONE
SHE WON'T BE HELPING ME WITH--

04:59.029 --> 05:02.473
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S "WHORE."

05:02.473 --> 05:04.505
(sighs)

05:04.505 --> 05:07.508
(Porter) I CALL THE COMPUTER.
 (Parker) NO WAY!
I CALLED IT ON THE BUS.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.481
WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! GUYS,
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

05:10.481 --> 05:12.513
THERE'S SOMEBODY
I WANT YOU TO MEET.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.515
THIS IS DR. DOLAN.
 HEY, GUYS. I'M JOSHUA.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.487
HE'S GONNA HANG OUT
AND WATCH US,

05:16.487 --> 05:18.519
YOU KNOW, BE A FAMILY.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.020
WHY?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.453
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD
A COUPLE OF...

05:22.453 --> 05:23.924
PROBLEMS LATELY.

05:23.924 --> 05:27.458
AND MY JOB IS TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S CAUSING THOSE PROBLEMS,

05:27.458 --> 05:30.761
AND THEN I CAN HELP YOU
BE A STRONGER FAMILY.
 CAN WE BE A STRONGER FAMILY

05:30.761 --> 05:32.963
WHILE PLAYING
"AGE OF EMPIRES III"?

05:32.963 --> 05:35.966
YEAH, SURE. I WANNA LEARN
HOW TO PLAY THAT GAME.

05:35.966 --> 05:38.769
GO GET STARTED.
I'LL JOIN YOU IN A MINUTE.

05:41.011 --> 05:43.013
(Lynette)
SO I LIKE WHAT YOU SAID

05:43.013 --> 05:45.015
ABOUT MAKING THE FAMILY
STRONGER,

05:45.015 --> 05:48.479
BUT AS I TOLD YOU, KAYLA'S
THE ONE YOU WANNA FOCUS ON.

05:48.479 --> 05:51.422
(Dr. Dolan) WELL, I PREFER
TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE.

05:51.422 --> 05:53.424
YOU SEE, IF A FAMILY
IS DYSFUNCTIONAL,

05:53.424 --> 05:55.526
IT CAN LEAD
TO A CHILD WITH PROBLEMS.

05:55.526 --> 05:57.758
YEAH,
 ORA CHILD WITH PROBLEMS

05:57.758 --> 05:59.990
CAN LEAD
TO A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY.

05:59.990 --> 06:03.063
I MEAN, KAYLA'S THE ONE THAT
GOT MY KIDS TO LIGHT A FIRE

06:03.063 --> 06:06.066
AND JUMP OFF THE ROOF.
 HONEY, IT--IT SOUNDS LIKE

06:06.066 --> 06:08.539
DR. DOLAN HAS, UM,
KIND OF A PLAN HERE.

06:08.539 --> 06:10.841
I UNDERSTAND.
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE...

06:10.841 --> 06:13.574
AT $140 AN HOUR, WE COULD
SKIP STRAIGHT TO THE PART

06:13.574 --> 06:15.576
WHERE YOU SIT DOWN
WITH KAYLA

06:15.576 --> 06:17.908
AND TELL HER
TO STOP BEING SO EVIL.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.081
MOMMY?

06:21.081 --> 06:23.914
YEAH? UM...
 I FORGOT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

06:23.914 --> 06:27.418
OH.
 IT'S A DRAWING
I MADE FOR YOU IN SCHOOL.

06:27.418 --> 06:30.461
OH, WELL, THANK YOU.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU.

06:30.461 --> 06:32.663
(whispers)
SHE NEVER DOES THIS.

06:35.095 --> 06:38.398
MMM.
 DON'T.
WE'RE WAITING FOR ELLIE.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.400
SHE'S FINISHING UP
WITH A CUSTOMER.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.903
WELL, MAYBE WHEN
SHE'S DONE TATTOOING HIM,

06:42.903 --> 06:45.906
SHE CAN PUT "STOP HITTING
THE BLIND GUY" ON MY FOREHEAD.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.809
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN HITTING YOU
A LOT LESS LATELY,

06:48.809 --> 06:50.511
AND I DON'T FEEL

06:50.511 --> 06:52.513
LIKE I'M GETTING
ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THAT.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.585
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M ABADHUSBAND.

06:54.585 --> 06:56.016
NO, SERIOUSLY.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.519
WE'RE GETTING ALONG BETTER.
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.751
YEAH, I THINK
IT'S BECAUSE OF ELLIE.

07:00.751 --> 07:03.754
ME, TOO. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO ARGUE WITH HER IN THE HOUSE.

07:03.754 --> 07:06.096
SHE MAKES US LAUGH.

07:06.096 --> 07:09.099
SHE TAKES YOU OFF MY HANDS
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.
 PLUS, SHE'S ALWAYS
HELPING AROUND THE HOUSE.

07:09.099 --> 07:11.201
I MEAN, YESTERDAY,
WITHOUT EVEN BEING ASKED,

07:11.201 --> 07:13.203
SHE WASHED ALL THE WINDOWS.

07:13.203 --> 07:16.707
SHE'S AMAZING. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE GETS ALL HER ENERGY.

07:16.707 --> 07:19.109
OKAY, SO WE'RE SQUARE.

07:19.109 --> 07:21.472
DUDE, YOU GOTTA CALL ME
NEXT WEEK.

07:21.472 --> 07:24.575
I GOT SOME GREAT STUFF
COMING IN.
 ALL RIGHT.

07:24.575 --> 07:27.548
(Gabrielle)
ELLIE, IT'S GETTING COLD!
 I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN!

07:27.548 --> 07:29.580
SO SHOULD I SNEAK OUT
THE BACK?

07:29.580 --> 07:31.682
OH, NO. THAT'S MY LANDLADY.
SHE'S COOL.

07:31.682 --> 07:32.883
SHE KNOWS YOU'RE DEALING?

07:32.883 --> 07:36.186
WELL, SHE'S NOTTHATCOOL.

07:36.186 --> 07:37.728
(door locks)

07:37.728 --> 07:39.790
OH, HEY, GUYS!

07:39.790 --> 07:43.864
YOU WERE UP THERE A WHILE.
CAN I SEE IT?

07:43.864 --> 07:47.498
UM, SHE--
SHE MEANS THE TATTOO.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.901
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO SEE IT...

07:50.901 --> 07:53.604
(lowers voice)
BUT IT'S KIND OF DOWN SOUTH.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.610
OH, ON HIS... GOT IT.
(chuckles nervously)

07:59.610 --> 08:01.181
DOES IT HURT?

08:01.181 --> 08:03.514
IT'S OKAY.

08:03.514 --> 08:06.957
ELLIE GAVE ME
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.963
AND FAIRVIEW HAS
A TOP-RATED SCHOOL DISTRICT,

08:12.963 --> 08:14.995
WHICH, UH... (chuckles)

08:14.995 --> 08:17.528
YOU'LL APPRECIATE
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

08:17.528 --> 08:21.071
WELL, COME ON IN.
I'LL SHOW YOU THE INSIDE.
 YOU GO AHEAD, HONEY.

08:21.071 --> 08:25.576
I'LL WAIT UNTIL MARK
WAKES UP FROM HIS NAP.
 ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL SEE YOU IN A MINUTE.

08:25.576 --> 08:28.508
(woman) OKAY.
 (Edie) ALL RIGHT...
(continues indistinctly)

08:30.981 --> 08:33.544
HI!
 OH, HI!

08:33.544 --> 08:36.717
I'M BREE HODGE.
 LAUREN BAXTER.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.919
SO ARE YOU THINKING
OF MOVING ONTO THE LANE?

08:39.919 --> 08:43.693
YES. THIS HOUSE IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

08:43.693 --> 08:46.857
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK--
IS IT A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD?

08:46.857 --> 08:48.899
OH, YES,
THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S SAFE.

08:48.899 --> 08:52.262
I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME
FOR YOUR REAL ESTATE AGENT.

08:52.262 --> 08:54.705
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:56.536 --> 08:59.840
WHAT IS THIS?
YOU LEFT IT IN THE PRINTER.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.672
IT'S A HOUSE LISTING.

09:01.672 --> 09:04.274
YEAH,
FOR A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE.

09:04.274 --> 09:08.178
YEAH, WAIT TILL YOU SEE IT.
IT'S GOT A POOL AND A GARDEN.
 THIS IS ABOUT DAD, ISN'T IT?

09:08.178 --> 09:11.121
I'M DOING THIS TO PROTECT US.

09:11.121 --> 09:13.854
WE DON'T NEED TO BE PROTECTED.
HE'SCHANGED.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.856
IT'S ALL AN ACT,
SWEETHEART.

09:15.856 --> 09:19.690
YOU DON'T SEE IT NOW,
BUT YOU WILL.

09:19.690 --> 09:23.033
HE'S ONLY BACK
BECAUSE HE WANTS SOMETHING.

09:23.033 --> 09:26.697
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY.
I JUST KNOW WE'RE NOT SAFE HERE.

09:26.697 --> 09:29.700
OH, SURE. THAT'S IT.
DAD HAS SOME EVIL PLAN.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.744
IT COULDN'T BE
THAT HE WANTS TO BE IN MY LIFE,

09:33.744 --> 09:36.977
THAT HE LOVES ME.
 HE ISN'T CAPABLE OF LOVE,
DYLAN.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.279
I FOUND THAT OUT
THE HARD WAY,

09:39.279 --> 09:41.281
AND WE NEED TO LEAVE

09:41.281 --> 09:43.784
BEFORE YOU LEARN
THE SAME HORRIBLE LESSON.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.623
MOVE IF YOU WANT.

09:52.623 --> 09:55.225
I'M STAYING HERE
WITH MY FATHER.

09:58.128 --> 10:01.672
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?
THINGS WERE GOING FINE.

10:01.672 --> 10:04.735
I'M SORRY.
WE NEED ANOTHER REALTOR.
 (engine starts)

10:21.892 --> 10:23.253
ALL RIGHT.

10:23.253 --> 10:26.396
BISCUITS ARE THE FOUNDATION
OF ANY SOUTHERN MEAL.

10:26.396 --> 10:29.399
LIKE MY MEEMAW USED TO SAY,
"AIN'T NOTHIN' YOU CAN MAKE

10:29.399 --> 10:31.862
DON'T TASTE BETTER
ON A BISCUIT."

10:31.862 --> 10:33.864
A FOUNT OF WISDOM,
YOUR MEEMAW.

10:33.864 --> 10:34.935
UH-HUH.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.166
WELL...

10:36.166 --> 10:39.740
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.
THANKS, ADELE.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.943
"ADELE"? IF YOU DON'T CALL ME
"MAMA," I'M GON' SCREAM.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.776
DON'T DO THAT...
(laughs) MAMA.

10:45.776 --> 10:47.818
(laughs)
NOW LET'S GET STARTED.

10:47.818 --> 10:49.780
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A FLOUR SIFTER.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.782
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.924
PASTRY CUTTER?
 SORRY.

10:53.924 --> 10:56.827
DOUGH HOOKS?
 DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.

10:56.827 --> 11:00.090
THAT'S FINE.
WE CAN IMPROVISE.

11:00.090 --> 11:03.433
WHY DON'T YOU START BY MEASURING
OUT OUR DRY INGREDIENTS?

11:05.796 --> 11:07.667
THE FLOUR AND SUCH?

11:07.667 --> 11:10.000
OH. (chuckles)

11:10.000 --> 11:12.172
MICHAEL IS GONNA BE
SO HAPPY.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.374
AFTER A LONG DAY OF WORK,

11:14.374 --> 11:18.278
HE CAN COME HOME TO A NICE,
HOME-COOKED SOUTHERN MEAL.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.780
ALTHOUGH HE ALSO ENJOYS

11:19.780 --> 11:22.212
COMING HOME TO SESAME CHICKEN
FROM RED PANDA,

11:22.212 --> 11:23.714
AND THEY DELIVER.

11:23.714 --> 11:26.186
(chuckles nervously)

11:26.186 --> 11:29.820
YOU KNOW, IT'S A SHAME THAT
MICHAEL HAS TO WORK SO HARD.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.122
BUT I GUESS
WITH ALL THE MONEY TROUBLES

11:32.122 --> 11:34.694
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN HAVIN'...
 HE TOLD YOU THAT?

11:34.694 --> 11:37.828
WELL, WE'RE GETTING PAST IT.

11:37.828 --> 11:41.301
ONLY BECAUSE MY SON IS
WORKING HIMSELF TO THE BONE.

11:41.301 --> 11:45.005
YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T HURT
FOR YOU TO GET A JOB.
 I HAVE A JOB.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.177
OH, YOU MEAN
YOUR LITTLE DRAWINGS?

11:47.177 --> 11:50.911
WELL, IT'S GREAT FOR A WOMAN
TO HAVE A HOBBY.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.412
PERSONALLY, I DECOUPAGE,

11:52.412 --> 11:55.015
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT PAYS.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.487
CHILDREN'S BOOKS PAY.

11:57.487 --> 11:59.850
REALLY? HOW MUCH?

11:59.850 --> 12:01.852
YOU KNOW, I THINK, ACTUALLY,

12:01.852 --> 12:03.994
I MIGHT HAVE
THOSE DOUGH HOOKS SOMEWHERE.

12:03.994 --> 12:07.457
OH, DEAR.
I'VE INSULTED YOU.

12:07.457 --> 12:09.860
NOW I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.402
NO, NO. IT'S FINE, ADELE.

12:12.402 --> 12:14.164
MAMA.

12:19.109 --> 12:22.112
SO WE WERE SORT OF SURPRISED
TO GET YOUR CALL.

12:22.112 --> 12:24.945
DON'T YOU NEED TO SEE KAYLA
A FEW MORE TIMES

12:24.945 --> 12:27.948
BEFORE YOU REPORT BACK TO US?
 WELL,
BEFORE CONTINUING WITH HER,

12:27.948 --> 12:32.853
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL
TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.
 OH, GO AHEAD. SHOOT.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.755
DO YOU LOVE KAYLA?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.759
LYNETTE?
 HMM?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.862
I WAS TALKING TO YOU.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.895
OH. WELL... S-SURE.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.837
I'VE BEEN VERY GOOD TO HER.

12:46.837 --> 12:49.870
THAT WASN'T HIS QUESTION.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.172
DO YOU HAVE A DIPLOMA
ON YOUR WALL, TOM?

12:52.172 --> 12:55.375
I DON'T THINK SO. ZIP IT.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.178
AGAIN, UM...

12:58.178 --> 12:59.950
DO YOU LOVE HER?

13:02.953 --> 13:04.454
OF COURSE I DO...

13:04.454 --> 13:07.517
AS MUCH AS I CAN, GIVEN THE WAY
SHE JOINED OUR FAMILY.

13:07.517 --> 13:10.090
IT'S JUST--IT'S COMPLICATED.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.963
I UNDERSTAND.
THE PROBLEM IS,

13:12.963 --> 13:15.525
KAYLA HAS PICKED UP
ON YOUR AMBIVALENCE,

13:15.525 --> 13:19.129
AND SHE'S BECOME
A VERY ANGRY GIRL.

13:19.129 --> 13:21.932
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

13:21.932 --> 13:24.935
OH, GOD. IS THIS GONNA BE
ONE OF THOSE THERAPY THINGS

13:24.935 --> 13:27.377
WHERE SHE HITS ME
WITH A FOAM BAT?

13:27.377 --> 13:29.379
THERE'S A BOND THAT DEVELOPS

13:29.379 --> 13:31.381
BETWEEN AN INFANT
AND HER MOTHER.

13:31.381 --> 13:34.214
YOU AND KAYLA
NEVER FORMED THAT BOND,

13:34.214 --> 13:36.947
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO
IS RECREATE IT.

13:36.947 --> 13:39.249
IT'S CALLED
ATTACHMENT PARENTING,

13:39.249 --> 13:42.322
AND IT STARTS WITH KAYLA
BEING BY YOUR SIDE

13:42.322 --> 13:44.224
AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.557
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED.

13:47.557 --> 13:50.260
I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE A DIPLOMA
OR ANYTHING, BUT...

13:50.260 --> 13:53.163
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO GIVE THIS A TRY.

13:53.163 --> 13:56.006
WHATEVER KEEPS YOU AND KAYLA
CLOSE AND INTERACTING--

13:56.006 --> 13:58.869
GO TO THE MOVIES,
GO SHOPPING,

13:58.869 --> 14:02.042
MAYBE TAKE A LITTLE TRIP
TOGETHER, JUST THE TWO OF YOU.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.844
COULD WE REVISIT THE FOAM BAT
IDEA FOR JUST A SECOND?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.978
THE PLAN SOUNDS GREAT, DOC.
DON'T WORRY.

14:07.978 --> 14:10.580
I WILL MAKE SURE THAT
THEY ARE TOGETHER CONSTANTLY.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.425
AS ME IF I LOVETOM
 RIGHT NOW.

14:15.425 --> 14:17.427
GO AHEAD. I DARE YA.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.435
MAY I HELP YOU?

14:25.435 --> 14:27.867
I HAVEN'T SEEN BENJAMIN
IN A WEEK.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.341
I WAS THINKING
I'D TAKE HIM FOR A FEW HOURS.
 IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD TIME.

14:31.341 --> 14:34.344
WELL, BREE, WHENEVER I CALL,
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME,

14:34.344 --> 14:36.546
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,

14:36.546 --> 14:39.549
I'D LIKE TO TAKE MY SON
TO THE CARNIVAL.
 WELL, THAT SOUNDS BORING.

14:39.549 --> 14:42.552
I KNOW. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM
TO EDIE'S HOUSE,

14:42.552 --> 14:46.056
AND HE CAN WATCH YOU GIVE HER
A DENTAL EXAM WITH YOUR TONGUE?

14:46.056 --> 14:48.218
BREE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:48.218 --> 14:51.221
WHAT YOU SAW WAS
BAD JUDGMENT ON EDIE'S PART

14:51.221 --> 14:53.994
AND GOOD JUDGMENT ON MY PART.
I PUSHED HER AWAY.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.397
YES, EVENTUALLY, WITH A BIG,
DOPEY GRIN ON YOUR FACE.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.369
CAN WE PLEASE
PUT THIS BEHIND US?

14:59.369 --> 15:03.073
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE BENJAMIN.
 I DON'T THINK SO.
I'D HATE FOR HIM TO BE AROUND

15:03.073 --> 15:05.375
WHEN YOU HAD ANOTHER ATTACK
OF DELAYED MORALITY,

15:05.375 --> 15:08.438
EITHER WITH EDIE
OR BEHIND THE WHEEL OF YOUR CAR.

15:08.438 --> 15:11.011
I AM NOT HAVING
THIS ARGUMENT.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.013
HE IS MY SON, TOO.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.615
NOT EXACTLY.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.219
WHAT? DON'T EVEN--

15:19.219 --> 15:22.322
STRICTLY SPEAKING,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN RELATED TO HIM.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.325
I MEAN, IT WAS FINE FOR YOU
TO MASQUERADE AS HIS FATHER

15:25.325 --> 15:28.028
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER,
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE NOT--

15:28.028 --> 15:30.700
THIS IS WRONG.
I WILL HIRE A LAWYER.

15:30.700 --> 15:34.104
I'VE ALREADY HIRED ONE. YOU'LL
BE HEARING FROM HIM SHORTLY.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.639
OH, AND IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD
FOR A CARNIVAL,

15:39.639 --> 15:41.141
WHY NOT CALL EDIE?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.046
I HEAR YOU GET THREE THROWS
FOR A DOLLAR WITH HER, TOO.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.350
BYE, GABY.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.382
YOU GUYS GOING
FOR ANOTHER WALK?

15:52.382 --> 15:54.654
YEAH. WE FOUND
THIS SWEET HIKING TRAIL--

15:54.654 --> 15:57.657
GOES RIGHT THROUGH
THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS.
 YEAH, AND UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE,

15:57.657 --> 16:01.031
ELLIE DOESN'T LET THE BRANCHES
HIT ME IN MY FACE.

16:01.031 --> 16:02.332
YOU'RE SPOILING HIM.

16:02.332 --> 16:04.194
(door opens and shuts)

16:04.194 --> 16:06.997
(beeping)

16:06.997 --> 16:09.269
WHAT THE HELL?

16:09.269 --> 16:12.272
(beeping continues)

16:14.004 --> 16:16.146
(doorknob jiggles)

16:16.146 --> 16:19.579
ELLIE, YOUR DOOR IS LOCKED!

16:19.579 --> 16:21.611
ELLIE!

16:21.611 --> 16:25.185
(beeping continues)

16:25.185 --> 16:26.656
(sighs)

16:28.188 --> 16:31.391
(beeping continues)

16:37.597 --> 16:40.400
OH, SHUT UP ALREADY.

16:43.073 --> 16:45.135
(beeping stops)

16:45.135 --> 16:46.206
(sighs)

17:04.354 --> 17:06.056
MOM, GUESS WHAT?

17:06.056 --> 17:08.228
DAD'S COMING
TO MY SENIOR RECITAL NEXT WEEK.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.601
I COULD SWING BY
AND PICKYOUUP, IF YOU WANT.

17:11.601 --> 17:13.663
WE COULD MAKE IT
A REAL FAMILY OUTING.

17:13.663 --> 17:17.107
DYLAN, YOUR FATHER AND I
NEED TO TALK... IN PRIVATE.

17:17.107 --> 17:19.368
I'M NOT DONE
SAYING GOOD-BYE.

17:19.368 --> 17:23.313
YES, YOU ARE.
PLEASE GET RID OF THAT GUM.

17:23.313 --> 17:26.476
I CAN HEAR YOU SMACKING
ALL THE WAY IN THE HOUSE.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.280
BYE, SWEETHEART.
 BYE, DAD.

17:37.287 --> 17:39.389
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

17:39.389 --> 17:41.531
THERE WILL BE
NO FAMILY OUTINGS.

17:41.531 --> 17:44.094
NOW, KATHY,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE RUDE

17:44.094 --> 17:46.836
TO A MAN WHO STILL HAS
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

17:46.836 --> 17:49.339
MEANING WHAT?
YOU STILL LOVE ME?

17:49.339 --> 17:51.341
I DO. AND I KNOW
I'M SOMEWHAT TO BLAME

17:51.341 --> 17:53.303
FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED
BETWEEN US.

17:53.303 --> 17:55.705
THAT'S WHY I'VE FORGIVEN YOU
FOR KIDNAPPING OUR DAUGHTER.

17:55.705 --> 17:58.708
THE LEASTYOUCAN DO
IS MEET ME HALFWAY.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.082
OH, WAYNE.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.255
I DON'T DESERVE
YOUR FORGIVENESS.

18:05.255 --> 18:08.518
MAYBE NOT, BUT I'M GONNA GIVE IT
TO YOU ANYWAY 'CAUSE...

18:08.518 --> 18:12.162
I STILL THINK
WE COULD BE HAPPY TOGETHER.

18:12.162 --> 18:14.864
COULDWE?

18:14.864 --> 18:17.096
GIVEN ALL THE THINGS I DID

18:17.096 --> 18:19.429
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

18:19.429 --> 18:21.631
WHAT'S THAT?

18:21.631 --> 18:25.104
I'M TALKING ABOUT
ALL THOSE MEN I WAS WITH

18:25.104 --> 18:27.477
WHILE WE WERE MARRIED.

18:27.477 --> 18:29.479
HOW CAN YOU FORGIVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

18:29.479 --> 18:32.342
THAT'S A LIE.

18:32.342 --> 18:34.344
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DARED.

18:34.344 --> 18:37.387
UNHAPPY WOMEN
DO DANGEROUS THINGS.

18:37.387 --> 18:39.649
I THINK THE WORST

18:39.649 --> 18:41.651
WAS WHEN I TRICKED YOU

18:41.651 --> 18:43.853
INTO THINKING DYLAN
WAS YOURS.

18:46.556 --> 18:51.261
I WANTED TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
BUT I WAS SCARED...

18:51.261 --> 18:52.762
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

18:52.762 --> 18:55.465
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

18:55.465 --> 18:59.669
BUT I'M NOT WORRIED ANYMORE

18:59.669 --> 19:01.341
BECAUSE YOU'VE CHANGED.

19:03.413 --> 19:05.875
SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,
WAYNE?

19:05.875 --> 19:07.447
FORGIVE ME.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.852
HEY THERE! MRS. McCLUSKEY.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.455
(chuckles)

19:17.357 --> 19:21.291
IF SHE'S NOT MINE,
THEN WHOSE IS SHE?

19:21.291 --> 19:23.693
DOES IT MATTER?

19:26.296 --> 19:30.500
OH, I GUESS I WON'T BE
SEEING YOU AT THE RECITAL NOW.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.602
HMM. WHAT A SHAME.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.393
ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS COCAINE?

19:53.393 --> 19:55.695
CARLOS, I WAS
A FASHION MODEL IN THE '90s.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.767
I KNOW COCAINE.

19:57.767 --> 20:00.430
(sighs) DAMN IT.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.732
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

20:02.732 --> 20:05.505
(beeping)
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

20:05.505 --> 20:08.578
SHOULDN'T WE HEAR ELLIE'S SIDE
OF THE STORY FIRST?
 HERE'S ELLIE'S SIDE.

20:08.578 --> 20:11.511
"SELLING DRUGS BRINGS IN
MORE MONEY THAN WAITING TABLES."

20:11.511 --> 20:13.513
THERE YOU GO.
WERE YOU MOVED?

20:13.513 --> 20:16.286
OKAY, LOOK,
MAYBE I WAS WRONG.

20:16.286 --> 20:19.549
MAYBE IT WAS FLOUR.
MAYBE SHE'S A PASTRY CHEF.

20:19.549 --> 20:22.592
YEAH! AND SHE CAME UP
WITH THAT TATTOO COVER STORY

20:22.592 --> 20:24.594
TO HIDE HER ILLICIT BAKING.

20:24.594 --> 20:27.497
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING,

20:27.497 --> 20:29.499
BUT THIS WOMAN'S OUR FRIEND.

20:29.499 --> 20:32.362
YES, AND I'M A CONVICTED FELON
STILL ON PROBATION.

20:32.362 --> 20:35.905
NOW IF THE POLICE FIND OUT
WE'RE HARBORING A DRUG DEALER,

20:35.905 --> 20:39.509
THEY'RE GONNA FRY ME.
WE HAVE TO TURN HER IN.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.445
WELL, THE PRIORITY FOR ME

20:45.445 --> 20:47.447
IS WORKING OUT
CUSTODY OF BENJAMIN.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.449
TO THAT END, I'VE WRITTEN DOWN

20:49.449 --> 20:51.451
ALL THE PERTINENT FACTS
ABOUT THE SITUATION.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.953
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS OVER THE PHONE.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.955
UH, LISTEN.
I'M GONNA HOP IN THE SHOWER.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.389
HOW ABOUT WE MEET IN YOUR OFFICE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR? GREAT. THANKS.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.566
ORSON?

21:06.566 --> 21:09.399
(water running, knock on door)

21:09.399 --> 21:10.470
ORSON?

21:10.470 --> 21:12.602
THE, UH, THE DOOR'S OPEN.

21:12.602 --> 21:15.405
EDIE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:15.405 --> 21:17.407
GET OUT HERE, YOU WUSS.

21:17.407 --> 21:19.409
THAT PURITANICAL
ROBOT BITCH OF YOURS

21:19.409 --> 21:21.411
IS SABOTAGING MY BUSINESS.

21:21.411 --> 21:25.054
OKAY, HANG ON A SECOND.
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

21:25.054 --> 21:28.588
(water continues running)

21:43.633 --> 21:46.836
YOU KNOW, UH, ORSON...
FORGET IT.

21:46.836 --> 21:49.939
JUST--JUST TAKE
A NICE, LONG SHOWER.

21:49.939 --> 21:52.482
REALLY? YOU SURE?

21:52.482 --> 21:55.585
YEAH. UH,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

21:55.585 --> 21:58.548
I CAN HANDLE BREE ALL BY MYSELF.

22:11.401 --> 22:15.665
SO THAT'S WHEN I SAW ALL THOSE
BRICKS OF COCAINE UNDER HER BED.

22:15.665 --> 22:17.837
I MEAN, I-I MEAN,
I THINK IT WAS COCAINE,

22:17.837 --> 22:19.839
AND I THINK
THEY'RE CALLED BRICKS.

22:19.839 --> 22:23.843
I'M JUST A SIMPLE HOUSEWIFE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.516
WELL, YOU'VE DONE
THE RIGHT THING, AND IT'S THANKS

22:26.516 --> 22:28.518
TO THE COOPERATION
OF CITIZENS LIKE YOU--

22:28.518 --> 22:31.521
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA GET HER OUT OF OUR HOUSE?

22:31.521 --> 22:34.584
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

22:34.584 --> 22:36.025
MEANING?

22:36.025 --> 22:37.987
BULLOCK!

22:42.532 --> 22:44.894
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!

22:44.894 --> 22:47.697
WHAT? WHAT?
I CAN'TSEEANYTHING.

22:47.697 --> 22:49.699
IT'S ONE
OF ELLIE'S CUSTOMERS.

22:49.699 --> 22:51.541
ACTUALLY,
I'M DETECTIVE BULLOCK.

22:51.541 --> 22:54.544
WE'VE BEEN TRACKING MISS LEONARD
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW.

22:54.544 --> 22:56.546
OKAY, SO IF YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING,

22:56.546 --> 22:59.549
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JUST BUST HER?
 SHE'S SMALL-TIME.

22:59.549 --> 23:01.551
WE'RE TRYING TO GET
TO HER SUPPLIER,

23:01.551 --> 23:03.653
SO WE NEED HER
TO KEEP DEALING.

23:03.653 --> 23:07.717
WAIT. SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE
A DRUG DEALER IN OUR HOUSE?

23:07.717 --> 23:09.719
YES. FOR NOW WE JUST NEED YOU

23:09.719 --> 23:12.622
TO ACT NORMAL, PRETEND LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

23:12.622 --> 23:16.095
WE'LL MOVE IN
WHEN THE CASE IS MADE.
 OKAY, LOOK,

23:16.095 --> 23:18.097
I'M ALL
FOR DOING MY CIVIC DUTY,

23:18.097 --> 23:22.171
BUT THIS WOMAN--
SHE'S... SORT OF A... FRIEND.

23:22.171 --> 23:24.674
AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING US
TO TRICK HER?

23:24.674 --> 23:28.037
I'M NOT SURE
WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS.

23:28.037 --> 23:31.511
MR. SOLIS,
YOU'RE ON PROBATION, RIGHT?

23:31.511 --> 23:35.515
HOW'D YOU LIKENOTTO BE?

23:39.819 --> 23:42.522
(sighs)

23:42.522 --> 23:45.655
(scoffs) WHAT ON EARTH
COULDYOUPOSSIBLY WANT?

23:45.655 --> 23:47.657
OH, I WANTED TO THANK YOU.

23:47.657 --> 23:49.659
AFTER YOU SCARED OFF
THAT COUPLE

23:49.659 --> 23:52.031
THAT WERE GOING TO BUY
THE YOUNG HOUSE,

23:52.031 --> 23:54.033
I, UH, FOUND ANOTHER BUYER,

23:54.033 --> 23:56.736
AND THEY'RE WILLING TO GO
10% OVER ASKING.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.909
WELL, GOOD, WHEN THEY DROP BY
FOR THEIR INSPECTION,

23:59.909 --> 24:02.912
I'LL JUST HAVE TO HAVE A NICE
LITTLE CHAT WITH THEM, TOO.

24:02.912 --> 24:05.174
YOU WOULDN'T WANNA
DO THAT TO ME.

24:05.174 --> 24:07.977
AND AFTER ALL,
WE'RE FAMILY.

24:07.977 --> 24:10.119
FAMILY?

24:10.119 --> 24:11.751
WELL, YES,
SINCE MY NEPHEW AUSTIN

24:11.751 --> 24:13.753
IS BENJAMIN'S
BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

24:13.753 --> 24:16.756
THAT MAKES ME
BENJY'S GREAT-AUNT--

24:16.756 --> 24:19.759
A TERM
I DON'T EXACTLY LOVE,

24:19.759 --> 24:22.492
BUT IT'S BETTER
THAN "GRANDMA,"

24:22.492 --> 24:24.063
WHICH IS WHATYOUARE.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.095
HOW DID YOU...

24:26.095 --> 24:28.097
CUTE STORY.

24:28.097 --> 24:31.100
I-I WENT OVER TO ORSON'S TO
ASK HIM TO GET YOU OFF MY BACK,

24:31.100 --> 24:33.102
AND THE POOR SAP--

24:33.102 --> 24:35.104
HE--HE'D WRITTEN
THE WHOLE SORDID TALE DOWN

24:35.104 --> 24:37.707
AND LEFT IT RIGHT THERE
ON THE TABLE.

24:37.707 --> 24:40.009
EDIE, IF WORD GOT OUT,

24:40.009 --> 24:43.753
MY WHOLE FAMILY WOULD BE...
HUMILIATED.

24:43.753 --> 24:45.755
OH, I DON'T WANT WORD
TO GET OUT.

24:45.755 --> 24:48.818
THAT WOULD RUIN EVERYTHING,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I...

24:48.818 --> 24:50.820
WELL, I OWN YOU.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.992
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.865
GLAD YOU ASKED.

24:55.865 --> 24:58.568
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,
I AM YOUR BEST FRIEND.

24:58.568 --> 25:01.771
YOU'RE GONNA INVITE ME
TO ALL OF YOUR FANCY PARTIES,

25:01.771 --> 25:03.773
SET ME UP WITH
ALL YOUR SINGLE FRIENDS,

25:03.773 --> 25:06.706
AND, WELL, IF I'M EVER
IN THE MOOD FOR MUFFINS,

25:06.706 --> 25:08.708
YOU'RE GONNA BAKE 'EM
FOR ME.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.880
EDIE... PLEASE.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.582
AND IF YOU DON'T,

25:12.582 --> 25:16.045
IF FOR ONE SECOND
I DON'T FEEL THE LOVE,

25:16.045 --> 25:18.948
I'M GONNA BURY YOU.

25:18.948 --> 25:21.651
YOU UNDERSTAND?

25:21.651 --> 25:22.952
YEAH.

25:22.952 --> 25:25.024
GOOD.

25:25.024 --> 25:29.158
OH, BY THE WAY, UM, I'M HAVING
AN OPEN HOUSE TOMORROW.

25:29.158 --> 25:32.862
A PLATE OF BANANA NUT MUFFINS
SURE WOULD SET THE MOOD.

25:32.862 --> 25:34.734
DON'T YOU THINK?

25:37.807 --> 25:39.308
(speaks indistinctly)
 (doorbell rings)

25:39.308 --> 25:41.310
OH! OH!

25:41.310 --> 25:44.614
(Lynette) HEY, HONEY,
COULD YOU GET THAT? THANK YOU.

25:44.614 --> 25:47.046
(Susan and Gaby
speaking indistinctly)

25:47.046 --> 25:49.078
HEY, BREE, PERFECT TIMING.
 (door shuts)

25:49.078 --> 25:52.922
WE WEREJUSTGETTING READY
TO DEAL THE CARDS.
 BREE, ARE YOU OKAY?

25:56.826 --> 26:02.231
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN...
KEEPING FROM ALL OF YOU,

26:02.231 --> 26:05.064
AND, UM...

26:05.064 --> 26:07.066
WE NEED TO TALK.

26:12.802 --> 26:14.103
HEY, WAYNE.

26:14.103 --> 26:16.706
I FINISHED THAT D.N.A.
YOU WANTED.

26:16.706 --> 26:18.708
I'M PROBABLY GONNA GET
IN TROUBLE

26:18.708 --> 26:21.611
BECAUSE I PUT IT IN FRONT
OF MARTIN'S TRIPLE HOMICIDE.

26:21.611 --> 26:23.613
YOU BAD GIRL.
 (laughs)

26:23.613 --> 26:26.756
WELL, I OWE YOU.
I JUST NEEDED TO CONFIRM

26:26.756 --> 26:29.719
THAT THE VIC AND MY SUSPECT
ARE RELATED.
 OH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE NOT.

26:29.719 --> 26:31.891
I RAN THE SAMPLES
FROM THE CHEEK SWAB

26:31.891 --> 26:33.963
AND THE WAD OF GUM
YOU GAVE ME,

26:33.963 --> 26:36.626
AND YOUR SUSPECT'S NOT RELATED
TO THE VICTIM AT ALL.

26:36.626 --> 26:39.899
ARE YOU SURE?
 MM-HMM. OH, YEAH,
IT'S 100% EXCLUSION.

26:39.899 --> 26:43.172
ARE YOU HUNGRY? 'CAUSE I WORKED
ALL THROUGH LUNCH,

26:43.172 --> 26:46.806
AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU AND I
COULD GO GET--

26:46.806 --> 26:48.607
WAYNE?

26:50.079 --> 26:53.783
OH, MY GOD.

26:53.783 --> 26:56.886
AND EDIE THREATENED
TO USE THAT TO...

26:56.886 --> 26:58.087
YES.

26:58.087 --> 27:00.089
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE, LIKE,

27:00.089 --> 27:02.922
THE GREATEST MOM EVER TO WANNA
PROTECT DANIELLE LIKE THAT.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.794
THANK YOU.

27:04.794 --> 27:07.657
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE WAS BLACKMAILING YOU.

27:07.657 --> 27:10.660
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE MADE A PLAY FOR ORSON.

27:10.660 --> 27:13.903
ICAN. SHE WENT AFTER CARLOS
AND MIKE AND KARL.

27:13.903 --> 27:15.905
THE ONLY PERSON SHE HASN'T
GONE AFTER IS TOM.

27:15.905 --> 27:16.906
YET.

27:16.906 --> 27:20.309
THIS WOMAN IS OUTTA CONTROL.

27:20.309 --> 27:23.943
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

27:23.943 --> 27:27.146
NO. WHAT AREWEGONNA DO?

27:54.073 --> 27:56.876
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:56.876 --> 27:59.678
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING,
EDIE,

27:59.678 --> 28:01.380
ABOUT ORSON, BENJAMIN,

28:01.380 --> 28:03.282
EVERYTHING.
 YOU DID?

28:03.282 --> 28:05.284
SHE DID,
SO YOU CAN KISS

28:05.284 --> 28:06.916
THAT LITTLE BLACKMAIL SCHEME
GOOD-BYE.

28:06.916 --> 28:09.318
WELL, I WAS ONLY DOING IT
BECAUSE--

28:09.318 --> 28:12.361
YOU WERE ONLY DOING IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE DEVIL.

28:12.361 --> 28:15.825
OKAY, FINE, CHEW ME OUT
AND LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

28:15.825 --> 28:17.767
IT'S NOT LIKE
ALL THE OTHER TIMES, EDIE.

28:17.767 --> 28:19.098
WE'RE DONE.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.771
DONE?

28:21.771 --> 28:24.774
WE'RE NOT INVITING YOU TO POKER.
WE'RE NOT TALKING TO YOU.

28:24.774 --> 28:27.807
WE'RE NOT EVEN GONNA WAVE
WHEN YOU JOG BY.

28:27.807 --> 28:31.811
FROM NOW ON,
YOU ARE INVISIBLE.
 AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE
EVERY WOMAN IN A 5-MILE RADIUS

28:31.811 --> 28:34.013
KNOWS THE KIND OF CRAP
YOU PULLED.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.986
WE TRIED TO BE YOUR FRIENDS,
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND

28:36.986 --> 28:39.989
WHAT THAT WORD MEANS,
SO NOW WE'RE GONNA BE SOMETHING

28:39.989 --> 28:41.921
YOU DO UNDERSTAND.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.954
GUYS, WAIT. WAIT. I KNOW
I CROSSED A LINE THIS TIME,

28:44.954 --> 28:46.996
AND, WELL, I'M--I'M SORRY.

28:46.996 --> 28:48.497
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

28:48.497 --> 28:50.129
MNH-MNH.

28:50.129 --> 28:53.102
NEITHER DID I.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.018
(Wayne's voice) OVER HERE,
HONEY, LOOK AT THE CAMERA.

29:09.018 --> 29:11.180
LOOK AT THE CAMERA.
YOU READY TO RIDE, DYLAN?

29:11.180 --> 29:14.053
NOW LOOK, IF YOU'RE SCARED,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
 I WANT TO.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.085
NO, YOU'RE A BRAVE GIRL.

29:16.085 --> 29:18.257
HOLD UP YOUR ARM
FOR THE CAMERA, SWEETHEART.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.759
HOW MANY STITCHES IS THAT?
 11.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.892
AND YOU DIDN'T CRY ONCE,
DID YOU?

29:22.892 --> 29:24.894
CAN I RIDE NOW, PLEASE,
DADDY?

29:24.894 --> 29:26.896
(can hits floor)
 OF COURSE, BABY.

29:26.896 --> 29:29.899
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.
 (click)

29:33.002 --> 29:35.004
(beep)

29:37.246 --> 29:39.308
DYLAN, IT'S ME.

29:39.308 --> 29:42.211
UH, YOU NEED TO
COME OVER HERE TOMORROW.

29:42.211 --> 29:44.914
YEAH, I KNOW IT'S MOTHER'S DAY,
BUT IT'S OKAY.

29:44.914 --> 29:50.059
I GOT SOME THINGS
TO TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

29:52.121 --> 29:53.122
(click)

29:53.122 --> 29:54.864
(hanger scrapes rack)

29:54.864 --> 29:57.066
OOH, I WANT THIS ONE.

29:57.066 --> 30:00.399
OH. YOW!
IT'S A LITTLE PRICEY.

30:00.399 --> 30:04.133
BUT I WANT IT. YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO ASKED ME TO GO SHOPPING.

30:04.133 --> 30:07.106
WELL, I KNOW, BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE SPENDING TIME TOGETHER,

30:07.106 --> 30:09.108
NOT GOING INTO DEBT.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.811
OH.
 (hangers scrape rack)

30:12.811 --> 30:14.583
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

30:14.583 --> 30:16.815
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"SUPPOSED TO"?

30:16.815 --> 30:19.048
I JUST...

30:19.048 --> 30:22.251
IT'S GOOD FOR US TO HANG OUT.
I ENJOY IT.

30:22.251 --> 30:25.154
IS THIS SOMETHING
THAT THE DOCTOR MADE YOU DO?

30:25.154 --> 30:26.856
NO. ALL MY IDEA.

30:26.856 --> 30:29.498
I JUST WANTED TO TREAT YOU
TO A REAL FUN DAY.

30:29.498 --> 30:32.161
ALL RIGHT.
YOU WANT ME TO HAVE FUN?

30:32.161 --> 30:33.302
MM-HMM.

30:33.302 --> 30:35.004
BUY ME THIS.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.439
OKAY.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.441
(under breath) GOOD TIMES.

30:44.173 --> 30:46.575
I'D LIKE AN OLD-FASHIONED,
PLEASE.

30:46.575 --> 30:48.978
(yawns)

30:48.978 --> 30:51.050
WHAT'S THE MATTER, MICHAEL?
YOU TUCKERED OUT?

30:51.050 --> 30:53.052
OH, YEAH, I JUST DIDN'T
GET MUCH SLEEP.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.224
HONESTLY, I WONDER HOW
YOU EVER GETANY,

30:55.224 --> 30:57.526
WELL, CONSIDERING
YOU GOT SUSAN IN THE BED

30:57.526 --> 31:00.229
SAWING WOOD ALL NIGHT.
(laughs)

31:00.229 --> 31:02.291
(Mike chuckles)
 I'M DOING WHAT NOW?

31:02.291 --> 31:03.963
(laughs) SNORING.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.435
WHAT'D YOU SAY
IT SOUNDED LIKE, MICHAEL?

31:06.435 --> 31:10.139
A BUNCH OF BULLDOGS
IN A BAG? (laughs)

31:10.139 --> 31:12.301
BUT IT IS A SOUND
THAT I'VE COME TO LOVE.

31:12.301 --> 31:14.003
(chuckles nervously)

31:14.003 --> 31:16.245
YOU KNOW WHAT MY MEEMAW
DID TO GRANDPA BOO?

31:16.245 --> 31:18.477
SHE SEWED A MARBLE IN THE BACK
OF HIS PAJAMA TOP,

31:18.477 --> 31:21.610
THEN IF HE ROLLED ON HIS BACK
TO START SNORIN',

31:21.610 --> 31:25.154
IT'D WAKE HIM RIGHT UP.
BUT I GUESS YOU CAN'T DO THAT,

31:25.154 --> 31:28.387
SEEING AS HOW YOU SLEEP
IN THE NUDE AND ALL.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.260
(laughs nervously) WELL,
THAT'S GONNA CHANGE REAL SOON.

31:32.992 --> 31:36.325
I'M GON' FIX MY FACE
BEFORE I ORDER. EXCUSE ME.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.599
OH, THIS IS NICE.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.601
NICE?
SHE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.334
YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP
COMPLAINING ABOUT ME TO HER.

31:45.334 --> 31:47.136
I DON'T... COMPLAIN.

31:47.136 --> 31:51.210
WELL, YOU COULD SEE HOW I,
AS THE NUDE, SNORING WHORE,

31:51.210 --> 31:52.511
WOULD THINK SO.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.214
(scoffs) OKAY,
NOW I MIGHT VENT A LITTLE BIT,

31:55.214 --> 31:58.217
BUT SHE'S JUST TRYING TO HELP.
 WELL, THE NEXT TIME
SHE TRIES TO HELP,

31:58.217 --> 32:01.490
SHE'S GONNA GET
AN OLD-FASHIONED IN HER FACE,

32:01.490 --> 32:05.094
SO YOU BETTER STEP UP
AND START DEFENDING ME.
 (lowers voice) OKAY, OKAY.

32:05.094 --> 32:07.426
WELL, LOVELY POWDER ROOM.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.129
IT'S AMAZING
THAT SUCH A BUSY RESTAURANT

32:10.129 --> 32:12.661
CAN KEEP THEIR BATHROOM CLEANER
THAN YOURS.

32:14.964 --> 32:18.507
NOW, MAMA, THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

32:18.507 --> 32:20.509
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME

32:20.509 --> 32:23.212
YOU DIDN'T MARRY HER
FOR HER HOUSEKEEPIN'. (laughs)

32:23.212 --> 32:25.944
YOU JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO TEACH THESE THINGS.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.246
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:27.246 --> 32:30.149
WHY DON'T I STAY
A FEW EXTRA WEEKS,

32:30.149 --> 32:32.351
AND YOU AND I CAN SPRUCE
THE HOUSE UP?

32:32.351 --> 32:35.354
AND DON'T WORRY.
I'LL LEAVE WHEN THE BABY COMES.

32:35.354 --> 32:38.227
AT MY AGE, ALL THAT CRYING
JUST CUTS MY NERVES TO SHREDS.

32:38.227 --> 32:41.390
NOW THE FIRST THING
WE'RE GONNA DO...

32:41.390 --> 32:44.293
(voice echoing slowly)
IS WASH YOUR WALLS.
 (heartbeat)

32:44.293 --> 32:47.066
JUST 'CAUSE
WE DON'T WALK ON 'EM

32:47.066 --> 32:49.138
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY DON'T GET DIRTY.

32:49.138 --> 32:50.169
(laugh echoes)

32:50.169 --> 32:51.240
(voice distorts)

32:51.240 --> 32:53.972
(voice echoing)
NOW HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

32:53.972 --> 32:58.107
(voices distorting)

33:00.349 --> 33:04.213
(voices continue distorting)

33:04.213 --> 33:06.015
...SCIENCE PROJECT.
 NOW WHEN YOU USED
TO READ...

33:06.015 --> 33:09.258
OH, MY GOD!
MY WATER BROKE.
 WHAT?

33:09.258 --> 33:11.090
MY WATER JUST BROKE.
I'M IN LABOR.

33:11.090 --> 33:14.363
WE HAVE TO GO.
 YOU'RE NOT DUE FOR A MONTH.

33:14.363 --> 33:17.996
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU,
MAMA. LOOK AT ME.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.369
AAH!
 COME ON. WE HAVE TO GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

33:20.369 --> 33:21.670
WELL, YES, LET'S GO.

33:21.670 --> 33:25.374
NO, NO, NO, YOU SHOULD TAKE
A CAB HOME AND START PACKING.

33:25.374 --> 33:27.376
THIS ONE FEELS LIKE
A CRIER.

33:27.376 --> 33:29.638
WELL,
ARE YOU SURE I SHOULD--

33:29.638 --> 33:32.241
AAH! AAH!
 COME ON.

33:32.241 --> 33:35.184
AAH! AAH! AAH!

33:35.184 --> 33:38.047
AH. AH.

33:38.047 --> 33:40.349
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, HONEY.
JUST KEEP BREATHING.

33:40.349 --> 33:42.351
HOW CLOSE ARE
THE CONTRACTIONS?

33:42.351 --> 33:45.054
A FEW WEEKS APART.
WANNA GO TO THE MOVIES?

33:45.054 --> 33:46.195
WHAT?

33:46.195 --> 33:48.097
I'M NOT IN LABOR, OKAY?

33:48.097 --> 33:50.229
BUT YOUR WATER BROKE.
I SAW IT.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.231
THAT WAS CLUB SODA.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.334
AMNIOTIC FLUID DOESN'T HAVE
ICE CUBES AND A LEMON WEDGE.
 WHAT, YOU FAKED THAT?

33:55.334 --> 33:57.336
I'M SORRY. I PANICKED.

33:57.336 --> 34:00.609
YOUR MOTHER JUST INVITED HERSELF
TO STAY WITH US FOR THREE WEEKS,

34:00.609 --> 34:03.242
AND YOU SAID NOTHING.
I HAD TO COME UP WITH A PLAN.

34:03.242 --> 34:06.245
WELL, WHAT HAPPENS
IF WE GO HOME WITH NO BABY?

34:06.245 --> 34:08.246
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS
A GOOD PLAN.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.248
DO YOU SEE THE EFFECT
SHE HAS ON ME?

34:10.248 --> 34:12.681
I JUST THANK GOD
I WASN'T DRINKING COFFEE.

34:12.681 --> 34:16.355
I COULD'VE HURT MYSELF.
 OKAY, I GET IT.
I'LL TALK TO HER.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.485
THANK YOU.

34:17.485 --> 34:21.190
DO YOU WANNA GO BACK IN THERE
RIGHT NOW AND TELL HER?

34:21.190 --> 34:24.293
NO. NO. THE RESTAURANT
JUST COMPED OUR DRINKS.

34:24.293 --> 34:26.295
WE'LL TELL HER AT HOME.

34:27.596 --> 34:31.239
WELL, WE'VE DONE
ENOUGH DAMAGE FOR ONE DAY.

34:31.239 --> 34:32.841
LET'S GO HOME.

34:32.841 --> 34:34.842
I WANT A CORN DOG FIRST.

34:34.842 --> 34:37.476
OH, HONEY, WE'RE ABOUT
TO HAVE DINNER.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.478
BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW.
I WANT A CORN DOG.

34:39.478 --> 34:42.351
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY,

34:42.351 --> 34:46.284
I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING HEALTHY,
AND YOU CAN HAVE IT IN THE CAR.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.318
CORN. DOG.
WHY CAN'T I HAVE ONE?

34:49.318 --> 34:51.320
(scoffs) WELL, AT THIS POINT,

34:51.320 --> 34:54.362
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
YOU'RE ACTING.

34:54.362 --> 34:56.725
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS,
KAYLA.

34:56.725 --> 34:58.767
WE HAVE BEEN HAVING
SUCH A NICE TIME.

34:58.767 --> 35:00.769
AND WE CAN KEEP HAVING
A NICE TIME.

35:00.769 --> 35:02.771
JUST GIVE ME WHAT I WANT,

35:02.771 --> 35:05.704
OR YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE
WHAT HAPPENS.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.776
ARE YOU... THREATENING ME?

35:07.776 --> 35:09.478
I'M JUST SAYING,

35:09.478 --> 35:12.481
I GOT THAT IDIOT PRESTON
TO JUMP OFF THE ROOF.

35:12.481 --> 35:15.444
WONDER WHAT I COULD GET
PENNY TO DO.
 (grunts)

35:15.444 --> 35:18.347
(gasps)

35:18.347 --> 35:20.149
I'M SORRY.

35:20.149 --> 35:24.393
I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT, BUT THAT WAS...

35:24.393 --> 35:27.656
(voice breaking) THAT WAS
HORRIBLE, WHAT YOU SAID.

35:27.656 --> 35:29.458
AND--AND...

35:29.458 --> 35:33.162
YOU SHOULD NEVER
SAY THAT AGAIN.

35:33.162 --> 35:34.633
OKAY, SO...

35:34.633 --> 35:37.506
COME ON. LET'S GO.
COME ON.

35:47.276 --> 35:49.318
OH, SUSAN, YOU'RE UP.

35:49.318 --> 35:51.350
MICHAEL TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR FALSE LABOR.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.353
THAT WAS UNUSUAL.
 WELL, IT HAPPENS.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.855
I KNOW, BUT USUALLY
YOUR WATER DOESN'T BREAK.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.427
OH, THAT. UM...

35:58.427 --> 36:01.490
TURNS OUT
I SPILLED SOME CLUB SODA.

36:01.490 --> 36:04.293
WELL, NO SURPRISE THERE.

36:04.293 --> 36:07.436
(laughs) MICHAEL TOLD ME
WHAT A KLUTZY KATHY YOU ARE.

36:07.436 --> 36:10.399
(giggles)

36:10.399 --> 36:12.401
I'M GLAD HE FINDS THAT CUTE.

36:12.401 --> 36:14.703
I MYSELF DON'T HAVE
THE PATIENCE. (laughs)

36:14.703 --> 36:15.744
(mouths words)

36:15.744 --> 36:17.406
(giggles)

36:19.378 --> 36:20.879
HEY, MAMA.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.212
HELLO, MICHAEL.

36:23.212 --> 36:25.514
DO YOU HAVE
A MOTHER'S DAY PRESENT FOR ME?

36:25.514 --> 36:29.858
HE SURE DOES,
BUT I WANT MINE FIRST.

36:29.858 --> 36:31.860
MAMA, WE NEED TO TALK.

36:31.860 --> 36:35.724
ABOUT WHAT?
 ABOUT THE WAY
YOU TALK TO PEOPLE.

36:35.724 --> 36:40.799
I MEAN, UM, SOMETIMES YOU CAN
BE A LITTLE TOO... HONEST.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.801
(groans)

36:44.273 --> 36:47.706
SORRY. GO ON.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.879
IT'S JUST... YOU DON'T
REALIZE HOW THINGS SOUND

36:50.879 --> 36:53.642
WHEN THEY'RE COMING OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH.

36:53.642 --> 36:56.645
I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL--
 OHH!

36:56.645 --> 36:59.718
I'M GETTING TO IT.
 NO, NO, NO, I-I LOVE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.951
IT'S JUST THAT, MAMA, SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO SUSAN--

37:02.951 --> 37:05.894
SUSAN, YOU LOOK A LITTLE PALE.
ARE YOU OKAY?

37:05.894 --> 37:08.727
OH, SHE'S FINE.
AND I WISH SHE'D CUT IT OUT.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.659
NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO--OW!

37:10.659 --> 37:12.931
SUSAN?

37:12.931 --> 37:15.434
ARE--ARE YOU GOING INTO LABOR?
FOR REAL?

37:15.434 --> 37:17.606
MAYBE. WHO CARES?
LET HER HAVE IT.

37:17.606 --> 37:18.707
OKAY, OKAY.

37:18.707 --> 37:21.340
MAMA, YOU'VE GOTTA STOP
TAKING POTSHOTS AT SUSAN.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.912
SHE'S MY WIFE,
AND I LOVE HER,

37:23.912 --> 37:26.575
AND I CAN'T HAVE YOU
UPSETTING HER.

37:26.575 --> 37:28.747
SWEETHEART, I-I AM DEEPLY SORRY
AND MORTIFIED.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.879
IF--IF I'VE CAUSED YOU
ANY DISTRESS,

37:30.879 --> 37:33.552
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

37:33.552 --> 37:37.456
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.
LET'S GO.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.757
OH.
 WHOO!

37:41.830 --> 37:43.832
(children)
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!

37:43.832 --> 37:46.465
OH.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.637
OH, MY GOSH!

37:48.637 --> 37:52.741
THAT IS SO SWEET.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

37:52.741 --> 37:55.273
WE'RE GONNA GO GET
YOUR PRESENT.
 YEAH.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.605
OKAY.

37:56.605 --> 37:59.508
I HOPE YOU LIKE TURTLES.

37:59.508 --> 38:02.280
SO...

38:02.280 --> 38:03.812
NO KAYLA?

38:03.812 --> 38:06.415
WELL,
SHE'S STILL PRETTY UPSET.

38:06.415 --> 38:09.358
AGAIN,
I KNOW I CROSSED THE LINE,

38:09.358 --> 38:11.360
AND I AM SO SORRY.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.362
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S NOT GET INTO THIS.

38:13.362 --> 38:15.364
I'M JUST GONNA GET ANGRY
ALL OVER AGAIN.

38:15.364 --> 38:18.567
TOM, IF YOU HAD BEEN THERE
AND HEARD WHAT SHE SAID...

38:18.567 --> 38:20.569
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU HIT HER.

38:22.631 --> 38:24.633
HONEY,
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL.

38:24.633 --> 38:28.807
AND NOW THANKS TO YOU,
SHE'S A FRIGHTENED LITTLE GIRL.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.039
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
DR. DOLAN,

38:31.039 --> 38:34.683
BUT YOU SAID
I COULD CALL ANYTIME.

38:34.683 --> 38:37.486
MY MOM...

38:37.486 --> 38:39.688
SHE HIT ME.

38:39.688 --> 38:41.690
NO, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.

38:41.690 --> 38:43.692
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU

38:43.692 --> 38:46.695
'CAUSE I KNEW WHAT SHE WOULD DO
IF SHE FOUND OUT.

38:46.695 --> 38:47.996
PLEASE HELP ME.

38:47.996 --> 38:50.929
I DON'T FEEL SAFE HERE.

38:50.929 --> 38:54.633
I HAVE TO GO. SHE'S COMING.

38:54.633 --> 38:55.964
(beep)

39:00.038 --> 39:01.540
(TV turns on)

39:01.540 --> 39:04.713
(gunshots)

39:04.713 --> 39:06.445
(tires screeching)

39:06.445 --> 39:11.650
UH, SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.
THE MAID TOOK THE WEEK OFF.

39:11.650 --> 39:14.483
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME AND...

39:14.483 --> 39:16.485
TELL ME THINGS ABOUT MOM?

39:16.485 --> 39:20.459
YOU KNOW WHAT, KIDDO? I-I HAD
KIND OF A BAD DAY YESTERDAY.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.932
I SAT AROUND HERE DRINKING,
FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF.

39:23.932 --> 39:26.565
AND...
AND THEN I CALLED YOU.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.567
THAT'S OKAY.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.569
IF YOU'RE FEELING SAD
OR WHATEVER,

39:30.569 --> 39:32.701
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CALL ME.

39:32.701 --> 39:35.574
NONE OF THIS ISYOURFAULT.
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.075
NONE OF WHAT?

39:37.075 --> 39:40.649
(sighs) I TRIED SO HARD TO LET
THE PAST JUST BE THE PAST.

39:40.649 --> 39:43.151
I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T WANNA BRING UP

39:43.151 --> 39:45.614
WHO DID WHAT TO WHO OR WHY.

39:45.614 --> 39:47.586
WHAT DID MOM SAY TO YOU?

39:47.586 --> 39:50.819
AND IT TURNS OUT I'VE BEEN
KIDDING MYSELF ALL THIS TIME.

39:50.819 --> 39:52.991
THIS FAMILY THAT
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR--

39:52.991 --> 39:55.464
IT JUST--
IT DOESN'T EVEN...

39:55.464 --> 39:57.095
EXIST.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.927
WE DON'T NEED HER.

39:58.927 --> 40:00.929
I'M FINE
WITH JUST YOU AND ME.

40:00.929 --> 40:03.932
I'M HAPPY NOW.

40:06.835 --> 40:10.939
OW!
DAD, YOU'RE HURTING ME.

40:10.939 --> 40:14.412
DAD, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

40:15.944 --> 40:19.588
YOU HAVE TO GO.

40:19.588 --> 40:21.590
WHAT'S WRONG?
DID I DO SOMETHING?

40:21.590 --> 40:25.524
GET OUTTA HERE!NOW!

40:31.700 --> 40:33.862
(door shuts)

40:33.862 --> 40:35.464
(crash)

40:38.136 --> 40:39.808
(sighs)

40:39.808 --> 40:43.071
ELLIE?
BRUNCH IS ALMOST READY!

40:43.071 --> 40:45.073
THIS IS GONNA BE SO HARD.

40:45.073 --> 40:47.776
YOU CAN'T THINK OF HER
AS YOUR FRIEND.

40:47.776 --> 40:49.718
THINK OF HER
AS A DRUG DEALER

40:49.718 --> 40:52.981
WHO COULD'VE GOTTEN US
INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE.
 I'LL TRY.

40:56.124 --> 40:57.656
OH! SHOOT.

40:57.656 --> 41:01.590
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.
 WHAT'S THIS?

41:01.590 --> 41:04.132
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S MOTHER'S DAY, AND...

41:04.132 --> 41:07.135
I HAVE KIND OF A CRAPPY
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY MOM,

41:07.135 --> 41:08.937
SO...

41:08.937 --> 41:11.940
THIS IS MY WAY OF SAYING
THANKS FOR BEING NICER TO ME

41:11.940 --> 41:14.603
THAN SHE EVER WAS.

41:14.603 --> 41:16.905
OH.

41:16.905 --> 41:19.748
OH, HONEY!

41:21.810 --> 41:24.683
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T
GET YOU THE CHOCOLATES.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.484
(gasps)

41:26.484 --> 41:30.218
NO, TRAVERS, NO, I DECIDED
SPENDING MOTHER'S DAY WITH YOU

41:30.218 --> 41:31.720
IS MORE IMPORTANT

41:31.720 --> 41:35.894
THAN SPENDING TIME
SHOWING PEOPLE STUPID HOUSES.

41:35.894 --> 41:39.197
OH, LOVE YOU, TOO, SWEETHEART.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.700
ACTUALLY, I THINK
MOMMY'S GONNA BE SPENDING

41:41.700 --> 41:44.202
A LOT MORE TIME WITH YOU
FROM NOW ON.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.805
BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
WHEN I GET THERE, OKAY?

41:46.805 --> 41:49.638
I LOVE YOU, BABY.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

41:49.638 --> 41:50.939
(beep)

41:57.215 --> 42:01.049
IT HAPPENS THE SECOND SUNDAY
OF EVERY MAY.

42:01.049 --> 42:04.753
WE CELEBRATE THE WOMEN

42:04.753 --> 42:06.755
WHO GIVE US LIFE...

42:06.755 --> 42:08.997
AND SO MUCH MORE.

42:11.059 --> 42:14.903
THE ONES WHO PROTECT US
AT ALL COSTS...

42:17.766 --> 42:22.841
WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO FIGHT
THOSE WHO WOULD DO US HARM...

42:24.873 --> 42:28.847
WHO PUT OUR HAPPINESS
AHEAD OF THEIR OWN.

42:30.579 --> 42:31.880
BUT MOSTLY...

42:31.880 --> 42:35.123
WE CELEBRATE A MOTHER'S LOVE,

42:35.123 --> 42:39.327
WHICH IS CONSTANT, ETERNAL...

42:39.327 --> 42:42.330
AND THERE
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
