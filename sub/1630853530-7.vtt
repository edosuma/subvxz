WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.222
The discovery of
a subterranean reservoir of liquid water

00:13.305 --> 00:17.392
on a ridge above Valles Marineris has
reshuffled the decks on the Red Planet

00:18.018 --> 00:19.102
as a new joint mission

00:19.186 --> 00:22.481
between the Soviets
and Helios Aerospace is now underway.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.193
A large specialized drill
will be flown down autonomously

00:26.276 --> 00:27.861
from the Helios ship, Phoenix.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.696
Once the well is established,

00:29.780 --> 00:32.950
its water could fuel the growth
of a more robust colony on Mars,

00:33.033 --> 00:35.911
long a dream of Helios founder, Dev Ayesa.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.291
The Soviet Union
has already begun planning the first steps

00:41.375 --> 00:43.836
of the drilling operation
with their new partners.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.506
Questions remain
about how NASA will respond,

00:47.589 --> 00:51.260
as the Russians have excluded them
from participating in the new venture.

01:03.188 --> 01:07.609
But once you get settled at Helios,
we'll figure out how to keep in touch

01:07.693 --> 01:09.903
while everything gets, you know--

01:09.987 --> 01:12.865
I'm not going to Helios.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.535
What do you mean?

01:19.079 --> 01:22.416
I'm being sent back to Moscow.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.920
Now that your cooperation
is no longer necessary,

01:27.004 --> 01:30.340
I am also no longer necessary here.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.472
But I need more time.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.517
At least a few more days to get things--

01:40.601 --> 01:42.936
Margo,
they are taking me to the airport now.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.564
What?

01:48.734 --> 01:50.527
No. That's not--

01:53.864 --> 01:55.115
-No.
-Margo.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.245
I appreciate everything
you have tried to do.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.208
If…

02:06.251 --> 02:08.169
If we do not see each other again…

02:10.214 --> 02:11.256
We will.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.343
We will see each other again.

02:19.848 --> 02:20.849
Yes.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.652
Goodbye, Margo.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.958
Mr. Wilson,
the Gettysburg Address is 272 words.

04:51.667 --> 04:55.420
Declaration of Independence
is 1,322 words.

04:56.046 --> 05:02.052
Your statement on the authorization of
the Rocketdyne contract alone is 27,000.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.597
I was asked to provide the details
of my consultancy with Rocketdyne

05:05.681 --> 05:09.726
from 1981 to 1987,
and that's exactly what I did.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.188
Having nothing to hide--
It ran a little long.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.149
Mr. Wilson, you're here because we believe

05:16.233 --> 05:18.569
that you have used your position
as the First Gentleman

05:18.652 --> 05:22.906
to influence the outcome of NASA
partnerships with independent contractors

05:22.990 --> 05:24.825
that you have personal connection to.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.744
Oh, no, sir. I'm here
because you have it out for my wife,

05:27.828 --> 05:29.830
and you have
since the day she was elected.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.333
President isn't under oath here today.
You are.

05:33.417 --> 05:37.713
And the return on some of these contracts,
Rocketdyne, Aerojet, FIP Systems.

05:37.796 --> 05:41.383
L&M Labs alone is high enough
to make the Jolly Green Giant blush.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.885
Isn't that right, Mr. Wilson?

05:45.262 --> 05:47.723
Never having had
the pleasure of meeting Mr. Giant,

05:47.806 --> 05:49.558
I'm afraid I can't answer that,
Congressman.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.441
One last thing, Mr. Wilson.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.319
Let me guess.
"Have I ever met the Pillsbury Doughboy?"

06:02.696 --> 06:04.448
A source has informed our committee that

06:04.531 --> 06:07.075
someone in the White House is
currently having an affair

06:07.159 --> 06:09.203
with a member of your wife's staff.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.163
Do you know anything about this?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.667
A source? What source?

06:15.751 --> 06:18.253
Are you aware of any such affair?

06:18.337 --> 06:22.382
No, Congressman. And I'm not sure
what this has to do with NASA contracts,

06:22.466 --> 06:24.176
which is the subject of this hearing.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.221
I'll determine what's appropriate
for this hearing, Mr. Wilson.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.354
This is ridiculous.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.523
Are you, Larry Wilson,

06:37.606 --> 06:40.067
having a secret affair
with a White House aide?

06:41.443 --> 06:42.903
And let me remind you,

06:43.737 --> 06:45.364
you're under oath.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.417
I hope you haven't been waiting.
I came as soon as I got your message.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.962
Who have you been talking to
about our relationship?

07:00.045 --> 07:01.338
No one.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.300
-I swear! I haven't told--
-It's okay. It's-- I'm not mad.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.428
Just-- We need to figure out who it is.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.432
-Did you mention anything to your mom?
-We don't talk. You know that.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.977
I haven't spoken about us to anyone.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.897
Willie Baron asked me today
if I was having an affair with you.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.525
With me? Did he actually say my name?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.026
"White House aide."

07:23.777 --> 07:26.196
-Maybe he doesn't know it's me.
-It doesn't fucking matter.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.948
I lied to Congress,

07:28.991 --> 07:30.409
which we both know is a felony.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.870
So let's take a beat…

07:32.953 --> 07:34.037
-Oh, my God.
-…and tr--

07:35.581 --> 07:38.417
Shit. Okay, I told one person,
but he swore--

07:40.169 --> 07:41.253
I'm so sorry, Lar.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.798
-What did you tell him?
-Nothing. Just--

07:46.884 --> 07:48.468
-How I feel about you and--
-Oh, Christ.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.220
-But he doesn't have proof.
-Who is it, Jeremy?

07:50.304 --> 07:52.347
You don't know him.
He's just a friend from college.

07:53.056 --> 07:56.143
It's gotta be this "Uniform First" thing.
He seemed pretty upset about it.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.231
Well, this is what I want you to do.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.775
I want you to call your friend,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.278
and I want you to tell him
that you were lying.

08:07.446 --> 08:11.491
You were drunk, and high on drugs,
and you made up a story.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.452
-He's not gonna believe me.
-Make him.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.457
Check into rehab if you have to.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.550
-You're cutting me loose, aren't you?
-Just call him.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.857
"Sources say that
President Wilson and the US

08:43.941 --> 08:49.446
were kept in the dark about the deal
until the discovery was confirmed."

08:51.949 --> 08:53.784
That's A1 leadership right there.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.578
They say the fish rots from the head down.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.956
Worst president in history.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.416
-In all of history?
-Yep.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.210
Is that because she's a she?

09:04.169 --> 09:06.421
-Because she's objectively terrible.
-Yeah.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.174
She used to come to my house
every Fourth of July.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.637
Ellen and my mom trained together.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.721
"Ellen"?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.598
Take a look at this guy.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.476
On a first name basis
with the President of the United States.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.272
-What's she like?
-Don't know.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.525
She never seemed interested
in talking to me.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.193
Well, that's her loss.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.280
She really stepped in it
with that gay thing, huh?

09:31.363 --> 09:34.741
Yeah. What does that even mean,
"Uniforms First"?

09:34.825 --> 09:36.910
Problem is
they can't keep their uniforms on.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.707
This guy!

09:43.876 --> 09:45.627
Afternoon, Mrs. Stevens.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.421
Hey.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.965
Jimmy, have you seen Avery's Silkie?

09:50.799 --> 09:52.634
-No.
-Hi.

09:52.718 --> 09:53.719
Sorry.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.471
-Hi, Avery. Hello.
-Hey.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.056
She's so pretty.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.099
Thanks.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.184
Come to me.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.896
So, Jimmy, you ready?

10:05.898 --> 10:06.899
I don't know.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.109
It's easy-breezy, in and out.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.903
I mean, you were practically born there.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.779
I know. It's just--

10:14.823 --> 10:16.575
I'm not good at this type of thing.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.912
Well, that's why Sunny's going with you.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.831
We're gonna have some fun.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.386
Listen up, people.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.767
The samples our geologist,
Cosmonaut Castillo, took on the ridge

11:23.851 --> 11:25.102
have come back.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.438
They are free of biosignatures,
and we are approved for drilling.

11:29.606 --> 11:33.151
And Helios Control has designated
an ideal spot for the well.

11:33.235 --> 11:37.781
And the BAD is being remotely flown
from Phoenix to Gagarin Ridge as we speak.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.783
-"BAD"?
-Big-Ass Drill.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.661
We'll be commencing drilling in two sols.

11:42.744 --> 11:46.206
I'll be piloting the MSAM
to the top of the ridge, and Stevens…

11:48.584 --> 11:49.877
Stevens?

11:54.882 --> 11:56.383
Stevens?

11:57.301 --> 11:59.553
-Stevens?
-Yes, sir.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.060
-You got right seat.
-Aye, aye, sir.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.650
Mueller, you'll be in command
of Helios Base while I'm gone.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.862
And Corrado,
you'll be controlling the CO2 compressor

12:16.945 --> 12:19.323
and the drill pressurization system. Copy?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.699
-Yes, sir.
-Aye, aye, skip.

12:20.782 --> 12:24.244
Myself and Cosmonaut Castillo
will be overseeing

12:24.328 --> 12:26.038
the drilling operation on the ridge.

12:26.121 --> 12:29.625
There is much to do to prepare,
so let's work together.

12:29.708 --> 12:33.003
Well said.
Let's get ready to Jack and Jill, peoples.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.212
Your father, he still…

13:16.713 --> 13:18.215
I think, does not care for me.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.175
He's just--

13:21.051 --> 13:23.387
He's like a cactus fruit.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.224
Prickly on the outside,
mushy on the inside.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.726
Mushy?

13:32.271 --> 13:34.523
This is difficult for me to imagine.

13:35.274 --> 13:36.567
Give him some time.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.989
He is very effective commander.
Focused, intelligent.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.907
-Drilling mission is on target.
-Wait.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.910
What do you mean, "drilling mission"?

13:46.994 --> 13:49.621
Tomorrow,
we head up to Gagarin Ridge to begin.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.376
But I haven't finished my tests
on the core sample yet.

13:57.129 --> 14:00.299
I thought you spoke with him.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.551
-No, I didn't.
-Wha--

14:02.634 --> 14:05.304
Now, before you-- Kelly, no! D--

14:12.686 --> 14:14.271
Wow, this is…

14:14.354 --> 14:15.522
-Crazy, right?
-Yeah.

14:18.317 --> 14:21.403
I figure it's gotta be one of the people
who worked in my department.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.656
The Russians got their hands on
an early version of the design,

14:24.740 --> 14:27.576
and these people are
the only ones who had access to it.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.413
But every time I feel like
I found the right answer,

14:32.039 --> 14:34.249
there's another piece of data
that doesn't fit.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.961
I've probably gone through that
like a hundred times already.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.088
It's tricky.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.841
I don't know. Let me think about it.

14:44.343 --> 14:46.553
It's not your basic Gaussian elimination.

14:46.637 --> 14:51.308
This involves human-behavior variables
and random external factors, and--

14:51.391 --> 14:52.518
-Yeah, I know.
-Yeah.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.607
Thank you for taking a look at that,
by the way.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.944
I didn't really know
who else I could talk to about it.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.446
Yeah, of course. I'm happy to help. Yeah.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.037
Where does he get all that energy from?

15:12.120 --> 15:13.664
I'm tired just watching him.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.676
Well, you know,
we should probably get going.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.054
Okay.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.349
Here's his stuff.
I put his eardrops in the side pocket.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.433
Yeah.

15:36.562 --> 15:37.563
Unless--

15:40.399 --> 15:43.694
Did you wanna come over for dinner?
Papa's making machaca.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.655
I do love his machaca.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.948
I know you do.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.825
But I…

15:51.410 --> 15:55.414
I sorta promised Javi I was gonna take him
to go see the Astros tonight.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.084
Right. No, of course.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.212
He'll love that.

16:05.257 --> 16:08.719
How is he, by the way, your father?

16:12.389 --> 16:14.391
Some days are better than others.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.229
We've gone through four nurses
at this point.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.108
This one smells weird,
that one's stealing from him.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.069
-You know the deal.
-Yeah.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.449
Come on, Daddy, let's go!

16:30.532 --> 16:32.409
All right. Come on. Let's go.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.827
Okay. Come here.

16:33.911 --> 16:37.497
You have fun at the game.
I'll see you Sunday, okay?

16:37.581 --> 16:38.749
Okay. Bye, Mommy.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.294
-Bye, baby.
-Okay, come on.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.172
About your work thing,

16:46.131 --> 16:48.008
maybe there's some data points
you're not considering.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.802
Trust me, I've looked
at everyone who's worked for me.

16:50.886 --> 16:52.638
I know, but…

16:52.721 --> 16:54.890
maybe it's not someone that
worked for you.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.269
I don't know. Just saying.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.355
Come on.

17:27.464 --> 17:31.718
You couldn't keep it in your pants
for one term, Larry? One term!

17:31.802 --> 17:33.011
I know I messed up.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.972
But if Baron had more,
he would've used it.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.432
It's gonna blow over. It'll be fine.

17:37.516 --> 17:38.517
Fine?

17:39.351 --> 17:41.478
You lied under oath. Don't you get that?

17:41.562 --> 17:43.981
But they set me up.
I mean, plain and simple. It was a trap.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.066
They didn't force you to sleep with him,
did they?

17:51.280 --> 17:52.281
Fuck.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.163
What--

18:01.623 --> 18:07.171
What is so special about Jeremy Zielke
that you're willing to throw away

18:07.254 --> 18:09.339
everything we've worked our entire lives

18:09.423 --> 18:13.635
to build-- our careers, our family, us?

18:16.138 --> 18:19.391
Nothing. There's nothing.

18:19.474 --> 18:22.144
-He just-- He--
-He what?

18:23.979 --> 18:25.272
He likes me.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.860
For fuck's sake, Larry.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.282
For fuck's sake. You can't be serious.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.952
It's not easy sometimes, you know,
being your husband.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.288
I mean, I'm a national punch line.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.624
"How are you gonna decorate
the White House, Mrs. Wilson?"

18:43.707 --> 18:45.584
"What are you making Ellen
for dinner tonight?"

18:45.667 --> 18:47.127
Give me a break.

18:47.628 --> 18:49.838
And since when do you care
about what other people think?

18:49.922 --> 18:51.507
It's not about that. It--

18:52.925 --> 18:54.092
Look, I know it's--

18:55.260 --> 18:57.721
This may be hard to understand,
but my entire life,

18:57.804 --> 18:59.515
I've tried to be logical.

18:59.598 --> 19:03.852
Make the smart move, the right move,
but lately, I just-- I keep feeling--

19:05.812 --> 19:06.813
I d--

19:11.276 --> 19:12.277
I don't know.

19:14.613 --> 19:15.614
Larry.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.744
Please don't take this the wrong way, El.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.121
I'm so proud
of everything that we've done.

19:23.830 --> 19:28.335
But the sacrifices that I've had to make,
that you've had to make,

19:29.378 --> 19:32.464
that everyone close to us has had to make.

19:33.841 --> 19:36.844
Your parents, your brother,

19:38.220 --> 19:42.432
Tom, Shirley, Pam, my family, my sisters.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.268
All so that you could get here.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.188
What do you mean, Pam?
What are you talking about?

19:49.481 --> 19:50.816
Nothing. I didn't--

19:50.899 --> 19:53.151
All I was saying was that
we've all sacrificed.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.987
Pam left me for Elise.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.239
Forget it. That wasn't my point.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.533
What do you mean Pam sacrificed for me?

20:06.582 --> 20:09.209
She did for you
what you couldn't do for yourself.

20:11.545 --> 20:12.963
What are you talking about?

20:15.883 --> 20:21.180
She knew it was her or your career,
that you couldn't have both.

20:25.517 --> 20:26.518
-Did you…
-No.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.981
-Did you tell her to leave?
-No! J-- Of course not!

20:31.064 --> 20:32.149
It was her decision.

20:32.733 --> 20:35.402
But you knew about it,
and you didn't tell me.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.487
Spare me the sanctimonious bullshit.

20:37.571 --> 20:40.449
Don't pretend like you're
some passive participant in all this.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.742
You lied to me,

20:42.701 --> 20:43.869
both of you!

20:43.952 --> 20:46.788
And how dare you make decisions for me,
for my life?

20:46.872 --> 20:50.042
Nothing was gonna stop you, Ellen.
I knew it, and Pam knew it.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.382
I can't believe this.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.568
So, those are your parents?

21:18.153 --> 21:19.154
Yeah.

21:21.949 --> 21:23.617
I mean, the facade of it all.

21:25.035 --> 21:27.538
To build a statue for something
that didn't even happen

21:27.621 --> 21:30.499
just to perpetuate this lie.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.001
It's fucking…

21:33.961 --> 21:35.045
Diabolical.

21:39.508 --> 21:40.509
Come on. You ready?

22:03.115 --> 22:07.953
You get right over here right this second.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.413
Hi, Mrs. Meineke.

22:11.748 --> 22:13.709
Let me look at you.

22:14.459 --> 22:18.213
Oh, goodness. You look just like him.

22:19.464 --> 22:20.799
How's your brother?

22:21.300 --> 22:24.469
Good. I guess. On Mars.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.139
Well, next time you talk to him,

22:27.222 --> 22:31.310
you tell him Mrs. Meineke says hi
and that she's awful proud of him.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.312
I'll try to remember.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.397
And who is this young lady?

22:37.232 --> 22:38.775
This is--

22:38.859 --> 22:43.155
I'm his girlfriend, Sunny.
Jimmy said he would give me a tour.

22:43.238 --> 22:46.033
Well, isn't that darling?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.455
I'm worried about him.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.042
He almost never leaves his room.

22:55.751 --> 23:01.173
And on the rare occasion he does,
he's just rude and distant,

23:01.715 --> 23:02.841
even to Avery.

23:04.134 --> 23:07.179
And he's been hanging
with these new friends of his.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.474
They're always in the backyard.
I don't know.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.351
He's been saying weird things.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.103
Like, hinting at how maybe
your parents didn't die

23:15.187 --> 23:16.688
the wayeveryone thinks they did.

23:16.772 --> 23:17.773
It doesn't make any sense.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.900
Sorry to throw all this at you.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.860
It doesn't make any sense.

23:21.944 --> 23:23.111
Bye.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.294
Rough night?

23:39.378 --> 23:43.048
Yeah, sorry.
Just watching a video from Amber.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.886
I gotta get in a call with Kel.

23:48.554 --> 23:51.348
It's time to get packed up for transport.
We leave at 0800.

23:52.266 --> 23:55.519
All the gear's in Hab 2, so hop to!

23:56.436 --> 23:57.437
Aye, aye, sir.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.316
Come on, PJ! Come on!

24:42.399 --> 24:44.776
You can do it. Little further.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.028
I got a treat for you.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.740
Come on, PJ! Good boy.
You want a little treat?

24:49.823 --> 24:51.909
Come on. Make it to me. Yes!

24:51.992 --> 24:54.494
Good boy.

24:55.954 --> 24:56.955
Yeah.

24:57.039 --> 24:58.040
Is he yours?

24:59.082 --> 25:00.792
No, he's Sandy's.

25:00.876 --> 25:04.505
But I have adopted him
while she's up on Phoenix.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.632
Dogs make the best friends.

25:07.508 --> 25:08.592
You speak Spanish?

25:09.551 --> 25:11.845
No. I backpacked through Guatemala.

25:11.929 --> 25:15.098
I would love to go to Cuba one day too.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.060
I think we should get back to work.

25:19.186 --> 25:22.856
Sí. Yeah. Right, work. Of course.

25:25.442 --> 25:28.070
Hey, bud.
You wanna go for adventure? Okay.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.489
Don't have too much fun without me, okay?

25:32.407 --> 25:33.534
Go on, PJ.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.829
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

25:37.913 --> 25:39.289
-Hi.
-How's it?

25:41.625 --> 25:44.336
Hey, Danny. Say hi to PJ.

26:03.397 --> 26:06.275
Nick. Could you get this thing
away from me, please?

26:08.193 --> 26:10.404
It's not a thing. It's PJ.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.325
Don't worry. I mean,
he's not gonna bite you.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.788
Not a big animal lover?

26:20.831 --> 26:22.082
That's not an animal.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.085
Don't you listen to him, Peej, huh?

26:25.169 --> 26:27.754
You are absolutely an animal.
He's just a sourpuss.

26:28.380 --> 26:29.381
Come have fun.

26:34.219 --> 26:36.680
This is so--

26:37.514 --> 26:38.849
It's fucked up, Dad.

26:38.932 --> 26:41.143
-Oh, come on.
-You can't do this.

26:41.810 --> 26:45.647
I analyzed the core sample you sent me,
and I still don't think we know enough

26:45.731 --> 26:49.193
to definitively rule out the presence
of microbial life in that water.

26:49.276 --> 26:52.321
Kel, we did all the required tests here.

26:52.404 --> 26:55.157
Hell, NASA was the one that came up
with the requirements in the first place.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.826
Look, we've checked all the boxes here.

26:57.910 --> 26:59.494
But the science is evolving.

27:00.287 --> 27:02.539
The work I did in Antarctica shows
that the methods--

27:02.623 --> 27:06.919
Kel, we both know
those methods are not widely accepted.

27:07.544 --> 27:11.757
Look, you're losing sight
of the bigger picture here.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.218
This aquifer's gonna change everything
up here,

27:14.301 --> 27:17.179
pave the way for more human settlement.

27:17.262 --> 27:19.973
A real viable colony.

27:21.934 --> 27:23.393
Manifest destiny, huh?

27:24.561 --> 27:27.022
Everything on Mars is just
ours for the taking.

27:27.773 --> 27:28.857
Here we go again.

27:28.941 --> 27:31.527
Well, you always wanted
to be the first at something, Dad.

27:31.610 --> 27:34.446
Now, maybe you'll be the first man
to kill life on another planet.

27:34.530 --> 27:35.822
Oh, come on. Kel!

27:36.615 --> 27:37.616
Damn it!

27:42.579 --> 27:47.042
It's a cliff, into a-- This wild cave

27:47.125 --> 27:50.796
that's like an old stalactite cave.
So it's just filled with…

28:34.673 --> 28:36.008
What the fuck, Danny?

28:37.509 --> 28:38.886
Danny, stop!

28:52.733 --> 28:54.318
What is wrong with you?

29:11.210 --> 29:15.631
I just thought it would be more people
building spaceships everywhere and stuff.

29:16.131 --> 29:19.468
No, it's pretty boring.
Well, except for Mission Control.

29:19.551 --> 29:20.552
Can we go there?

29:20.969 --> 29:23.597
Not really. You need special clearance.

29:26.016 --> 29:27.559
Visitor badges won't get you in.

29:37.778 --> 29:40.614
-What's in there?
-Training Department.

29:40.697 --> 29:42.658
-Training Department.
-I think.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.207
What's over there?

29:50.290 --> 29:53.627
I don't know. More offices, I think.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.510
-Now that seems promising.
-Wait.

30:07.683 --> 30:09.017
Everybody's staring at us.

30:09.101 --> 30:10.978
Well, that's 'cause you're space royalty.

30:12.980 --> 30:15.482
Well, this is what the FAO
told us though, right? So…

30:15.566 --> 30:17.776
Yeah, but if you're
gonna have to adjust the parameters,

30:17.860 --> 30:19.278
it requires a time frame.

30:28.370 --> 30:30.664
What are Banana Twins?

30:31.665 --> 30:34.459
Sponge cake filled with
whipped cream, I think.

30:37.421 --> 30:39.173
-Maybe we should get going.
-Let's see.

30:42.593 --> 30:44.344
Holy shit. That's amazing.

30:44.428 --> 30:45.721
Yeah?

30:45.804 --> 30:47.806
I might have to steal a few more of these.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.185
-Whoops.
-I am so sorry. Crap.

30:51.894 --> 30:55.022
-Yep. Let me help you with that.
-Sorry about that.

30:55.105 --> 30:56.315
Thank you so much.

30:57.983 --> 30:59.526
Gravity sucks, right?

31:00.194 --> 31:03.614
-That's so funny. I'm all thumbs today.
-Yeah.

31:04.281 --> 31:06.950
-Had my mind on sweets.
-There we go.

31:11.580 --> 31:13.457
-Thank you so much.
-Enjoy.

31:21.298 --> 31:25.969
Sorry. I think we better go. I told you
I'm not good at this kind of thing.

31:26.053 --> 31:28.680
Come on, I know you're having fun.

31:29.431 --> 31:31.141
-I can see a smile.
-No, you don't.

31:31.225 --> 31:33.352
Really? Well, I saw it for a second.

31:35.187 --> 31:36.480
Jimmy Stevens.

31:39.650 --> 31:40.651
Hey, Mr. Rossi.

31:41.151 --> 31:42.611
I've told you before. Call me Al.

31:44.029 --> 31:45.155
What are you doing here?

31:45.822 --> 31:47.908
Finally giving in to the family business?

31:49.243 --> 31:51.995
Just showing a friend around. Yeah.

31:52.079 --> 31:53.247
Sunny.

31:53.330 --> 31:57.417
Jimmy promised me that there would be
some great snacks hidden in here.

31:57.501 --> 31:59.878
But I think I may have been misled.

32:01.380 --> 32:04.883
I keep my Oreos stashed
behind the granola bars in the cabinet.

32:04.967 --> 32:06.301
No one ever looks there.

32:06.385 --> 32:07.469
Thanks for the tip.

32:10.347 --> 32:13.058
So is this a friend
of the romantic persuasion?

32:14.852 --> 32:15.936
That's great, kid.

32:16.562 --> 32:18.021
So how are you doing otherwise?

32:18.605 --> 32:22.484
You still into-- What was it
you do again? Computers, right?

32:23.569 --> 32:24.653
Yeah. We--

32:24.736 --> 32:27.656
We overhaul systems
and repair IT peripherals.

32:28.824 --> 32:29.825
Stuff like that.

32:29.908 --> 32:32.286
-Sounds exciting.
-Yeah.

32:32.369 --> 32:34.246
-Hey, have you seen it?
-Seen what?

32:34.329 --> 32:35.581
Over here.

32:41.628 --> 32:42.754
Pretty cool, huh?

32:55.517 --> 32:58.687
"Dear Ms. Stevens, I am your biggest fan.

33:01.148 --> 33:03.609
I hope you are who they pick
to go to the moon.

33:05.736 --> 33:09.031
My parents always told me
I could be anything I wanted growing up.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.702
But I never really believed them
until now."

33:20.709 --> 33:22.419
She was something else, your mom.

33:24.630 --> 33:25.631
Yeah.

33:27.758 --> 33:32.012
To be honest, when I first met her
up on Jamestown, she was struggling.

33:33.931 --> 33:37.601
But after a while, she really settled in.

33:39.603 --> 33:40.687
She found herself.

33:45.067 --> 33:48.028
Except for when she was sneaking
those goddamn cigarettes in the air lock.

33:53.116 --> 33:54.409
I snuck those up to her.

33:55.577 --> 33:56.954
You did?

33:57.037 --> 33:58.038
Yeah.

33:59.831 --> 34:02.084
I ought to report you to NASA security.

34:06.338 --> 34:09.757
Anyway,
I thought you might like to see this.

34:12.219 --> 34:13.512
Thanks.

34:16.681 --> 34:17.891
See you around, Jimmy.

34:38.745 --> 34:40.581
There you are.
I was looking everywhere for you.

34:40.664 --> 34:44.293
I couldn't find a badge to save my life.
I even tried--

34:49.715 --> 34:50.716
Oh, my God.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.342
You're amazing. Let's go.

34:55.637 --> 34:57.890
Senator, we sat right here in this office

34:57.973 --> 35:00.142
and spoke of partnership and cooperation.

35:00.642 --> 35:02.603
I'm sorry, Madam President.

35:02.686 --> 35:05.731
Unfortunately,
I can no longer support the jobs bill.

35:05.814 --> 35:08.650
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, John.

35:14.615 --> 35:18.452
And somewhere between Tallahassee
and Birmingham, we stop for breakfast.

35:18.535 --> 35:22.915
Lee orders cornflakes.
And then he pours Tabasco all over them.

35:22.998 --> 35:24.416
And I'm sitting there,

35:24.499 --> 35:26.001
"What the hell are you doing?"

35:26.084 --> 35:30.464
And he says, "Karl, it's the only way
I can taste the damn things."

35:32.007 --> 35:34.593
A man ahead of his time.
We wouldn't be here without him.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.845
None of us would. God rest his soul.

35:39.473 --> 35:41.808
But we're not here
to talk about Lee Atwater.

35:41.892 --> 35:44.228
We're here to talk about this situation.

35:44.311 --> 35:46.605
Well, first of all,
it's a bunch of hogwash.

35:47.147 --> 35:49.191
Total fabrication. Never happened.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.153
Democrats have never gotten over
losing in '92,

35:53.237 --> 35:57.908
and now they're doing whatever it takes
to torpedo my presidency.

35:57.991 --> 36:01.370
This is an organized assault on us,
on what we represent.

36:02.246 --> 36:04.873
Now that our poll numbers have
taken a hit, it's open season.

36:04.957 --> 36:06.625
That's all well and good.

36:06.708 --> 36:09.461
But the fact remains,
they're gonna come at you with this.

36:09.962 --> 36:13.924
And the second it's out in the media,
it's a truth, whether it's true or not.

36:14.007 --> 36:16.593
But that's insane. I mean, the truth…

36:19.096 --> 36:21.598
The truth has to have some meaning,
doesn't it?

36:22.182 --> 36:23.934
Truth is not what they're after.

36:24.017 --> 36:28.230
If it were, why would they be using
a sham hearing on NASA contracts

36:28.313 --> 36:30.899
to bring up a personal matter
in a marriage?

36:30.983 --> 36:35.028
A marriage that has lasted over 20 years,
through thick and thin.

36:35.112 --> 36:36.154
It's absurd.

36:36.238 --> 36:37.531
Absolutely absurd.

36:37.614 --> 36:40.075
What is true is they will stop at nothing.

36:40.158 --> 36:43.495
They will find any crack, any fissure,
and they will crawl down

36:43.579 --> 36:47.291
and dig in the dirt until they find
something they can chew on.

36:47.374 --> 36:50.294
Heck, we'd do the same.
You know Lee would.

36:50.377 --> 36:52.462
Then how do we kill this before it starts?

36:53.463 --> 36:54.840
Baron's the key.

36:54.923 --> 36:58.135
Ever since he had his sex scandal,
he's been itching for a payback.

36:58.635 --> 37:01.180
And you really think
he'll listen to reason?

37:01.763 --> 37:04.975
I guarantee you, he's got
a few more skeletons in his closet

37:05.058 --> 37:06.643
he doesn't want seeing the light of day.

37:06.727 --> 37:09.980
Yeah. That's a great idea.
I mean, really put the screws to him.

37:10.063 --> 37:11.315
I will.

37:12.357 --> 37:16.570
But honestly, the best defense we have is
what I'm looking at right now.

37:17.070 --> 37:20.115
You are everything
America is supposed to be.

37:27.748 --> 37:30.501
The question
on many experts' minds is,

37:30.584 --> 37:33.462
"Will this lead to more American companies

37:33.545 --> 37:35.339
making deals with the Soviets?"

37:35.422 --> 37:40.469
That's the fear on Wall Street today
as word of the Russo-Helios announcement

37:40.552 --> 37:42.971
has shocked the financial sector--

37:44.473 --> 37:46.225
James, take me to Andrews, please.

37:46.808 --> 37:48.644
Madam President, the fundraiser is still--

37:48.727 --> 37:52.481
Just tell them I'm under the weather
and I'm going back to the White House.

37:52.564 --> 37:54.316
We'll take the 707. No press.

37:54.816 --> 37:55.817
Yes, ma'am.

38:09.248 --> 38:11.500
Stevens, I need a word.

38:20.676 --> 38:21.677
What's up?

38:23.220 --> 38:26.515
I'm taking you off the flight
to the ridge. Louisa will take your seat.

38:26.598 --> 38:28.934
Oh, yeah? How come?

38:29.518 --> 38:33.438
Look at you. You can't focus your eyes.
Can't stand still.

38:34.022 --> 38:36.066
You don't think
I've seen a pilot on go pills before?

38:37.025 --> 38:38.569
Don't know what you're talking about, sir.

38:38.652 --> 38:39.778
Bullshit, you don't.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.698
Nodding off one minute,
talking a mile a minute the next.

38:42.781 --> 38:44.533
I mean, you're a fucking mess.

38:44.616 --> 38:46.618
And now you're stomping on dogs.

38:46.702 --> 38:48.328
What? You mean that-- What, that toy?

38:48.412 --> 38:53.292
Yeah. I cut you a lot of slack,
more than most, but now you're on notice.

38:54.877 --> 38:58.088
I made that mistake once with your dad,
and I'm not gonna do it again.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.424
-Yeah, well, I'm not my dad.
-You got that right.

39:02.843 --> 39:06.221
Louisa, you're now taking right seat
on the flight to the ridge.

39:06.805 --> 39:09.433
Nick, you're in charge of Helios Base
while we're gone.

39:09.516 --> 39:12.227
And, Danny,
you can help him out with communications.

39:12.311 --> 39:14.021
-You think you can handle that?
-Yes, sir.

39:14.521 --> 39:17.065
You fuck up one more time,
and I mean once,

39:17.149 --> 39:20.027
and I'll confine your ass to quarters
on Phoenix until we return to Earth.

39:20.110 --> 39:21.820
-You got that?
-Yeah, whatever.

39:23.071 --> 39:25.115
-"Whatever"?
-Whatever you want, boss.

39:25.199 --> 39:26.658
What happened to "sir"?

39:28.035 --> 39:29.036
Yes, sir.

39:35.250 --> 39:36.251
Okay.

39:37.336 --> 39:38.504
Thank you, sir.

39:40.255 --> 39:41.256
Watch it.

39:41.340 --> 39:44.009
Whatever you say… sir.

39:44.885 --> 39:46.220
-I said watch it!
-Or what?

39:46.303 --> 39:48.597
What are you gonna do?
You're a tough guy now?

39:49.181 --> 39:50.182
Huh?

39:51.934 --> 39:53.560
Come on, Danny. Come on.

39:54.811 --> 39:55.812
Hit me.

39:57.397 --> 39:59.608
Is that what you want? Hit me. Come on.

40:01.026 --> 40:03.612
Hit me! Be a man!

40:20.921 --> 40:22.130
That's what I thought.

40:25.175 --> 40:26.552
Fucking pathetic.

40:54.371 --> 40:55.372
Good.

40:55.455 --> 40:57.708
We need to discuss
this new water ice site.

40:58.208 --> 41:01.253
It looks promising,
but it's a few kilometers from--

41:04.339 --> 41:05.674
What?

41:05.757 --> 41:08.177
-I know who it was.
-Who who was?

41:08.260 --> 41:10.637
Who gave my engine design to the Russians.

41:14.183 --> 41:15.809
-Aleida, I'm--
-It was Emma.

41:18.020 --> 41:19.188
Emma?

41:20.189 --> 41:22.691
She's the only one that makes sense.

41:23.483 --> 41:24.484
You think…

41:25.944 --> 41:28.864
You think Emma Jorgens is working
for the Russians?

41:29.615 --> 41:30.699
Yes.

41:35.162 --> 41:36.163
Okay.

41:36.246 --> 41:37.372
No.

41:37.456 --> 41:41.376
All the plans, all the designs,
they all came across her desk.

41:41.460 --> 41:43.212
I've worked with her for 20 years.

41:43.295 --> 41:45.005
She's devoted her life to this program.

41:45.088 --> 41:47.841
There is no way she would ever do
what you're accusing her of.

41:47.925 --> 41:51.178
Yeah, I know. I thought the same thing.
But then, look at this.

41:52.262 --> 41:53.889
-What is this?
-A credit report.

41:55.057 --> 41:57.434
-You ran her credit report?
-And she's in debt.

41:58.018 --> 42:00.229
Like, $40,000 in debt.

42:00.312 --> 42:02.523
Aldrich Ames owed less than half of that.

42:03.106 --> 42:05.651
Do you know why she owes so much money?

42:07.069 --> 42:08.070
No.

42:08.654 --> 42:13.575
Because her sister has breast cancer,
and Emma is paying for her medical care.

42:16.995 --> 42:20.290
Just because her sister is sick
does not take her out of the running.

42:20.374 --> 42:23.252
Secretaries are usually the first to turn

42:23.335 --> 42:25.587
because they have all the access
and none of the power and--

42:25.671 --> 42:27.172
That's enough!

42:27.256 --> 42:28.549
Aleida.

42:28.632 --> 42:31.343
Goddamn it,
I told you to leave this alone.

42:31.927 --> 42:33.011
You're the lead engineer

42:33.095 --> 42:37.391
on the mission that landed
the first human beings on Mars.

42:37.474 --> 42:39.518
And instead of doing your job,
you're up all night

42:39.601 --> 42:41.728
playing Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

42:42.563 --> 42:43.730
I'm still doing my job.

42:43.814 --> 42:45.941
Really? Because, to me,
it looks like you're in here

42:46.024 --> 42:49.069
casting suspicion on people,
innocent people.

42:50.445 --> 42:55.617
You, of all people, should know
how damaging false accusations can be.

43:02.833 --> 43:04.543
Maybe you need to take a break.

43:06.795 --> 43:07.796
A break?

43:07.880 --> 43:10.799
A vacation, a sabbatical.
Whatever you want to call it.

43:10.883 --> 43:12.801
Since when does Margo Madison give breaks?

43:15.095 --> 43:17.848
This has clearly all been
too much for you, Aleida.

43:17.931 --> 43:19.266
The stress, the pressure.

43:20.267 --> 43:22.519
I know you've got a lot going on
at home too.

43:27.149 --> 43:30.360
-I'm not taking a break.
-Then you need to stop with all this…

43:31.778 --> 43:33.655
this nonsense.

43:34.823 --> 43:36.366
Or it may not be up to you.

45:18.260 --> 45:20.387
This is Sunny. You know what to do.

45:37.696 --> 45:39.781
This is Sunny. You know what to do.

45:40.824 --> 45:43.118
Hey. It's me.

45:45.621 --> 45:47.497
Jimmy Stevens.

45:50.626 --> 45:52.878
I was thinking
it wasn't the best thing to do.

45:55.339 --> 45:56.465
The badge, I mean.

45:58.258 --> 45:59.426
I think we should just go back

45:59.510 --> 46:01.303
and leave it somewhere,
and they'll find it.

46:01.970 --> 46:02.971
Okay?

46:06.308 --> 46:07.392
Call me back.

46:09.645 --> 46:10.646
Bye.

46:19.571 --> 46:20.739
Hey, Sunny.

46:20.822 --> 46:21.990
It's Charles.

46:26.119 --> 46:27.788
-Hey.
-Come outside.

46:29.748 --> 46:31.834
-Outside, like--
-Outside your house.

46:35.254 --> 46:36.588
Okay.

46:52.020 --> 46:53.021
Hey.

46:54.064 --> 46:56.233
-What's up?
-Sorry it's so late.

46:57.651 --> 46:58.861
Worked like a charm.

46:59.444 --> 47:03.115
-Just came from a little adventure at JSC.
-What'd you do?

47:13.876 --> 47:15.043
We took 'em back.

47:16.336 --> 47:17.671
They're yours again, brother.

47:19.548 --> 47:21.800
So? What do you think?

47:23.844 --> 47:29.099
I think I'm gonna have to figure out
where to put this fucking thing.

47:30.934 --> 47:32.686
Yeah.

48:44.550 --> 48:45.551
Hi.

48:46.134 --> 48:47.511
Hi.

48:50.472 --> 48:51.515
Can I come in?

49:06.780 --> 49:12.578
I wonder what this valley will look like
in ten, 20, a hundred years.

49:12.661 --> 49:14.872
And how many people
will be able to make a life here

49:14.955 --> 49:16.874
because of what we're doing right now.

49:19.251 --> 49:20.711
We have good pressure.

49:20.794 --> 49:24.882
We are ready to drill.
Surface casing pressurization holding.

49:24.965 --> 49:27.134
We've got good torque on our drill.

49:27.634 --> 49:29.928
Slips are engaged.
Alignment is still good.

49:30.762 --> 49:32.973
Okay, take your time.
Let's do this right.

49:34.141 --> 49:36.226
Get ready for the next casing segment.

49:36.310 --> 49:37.811
Hand me the C spanner.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.731
Yeah, let's crank up
the rotary speed a bit.

49:40.814 --> 49:42.316
Watch the CO2 pressure.

49:49.698 --> 49:51.450
Watch the drill housing pressure.

49:51.533 --> 49:54.870
We must be in pressure window
when we penetrate into the reservoir.

49:55.370 --> 49:56.538
If pressure is too low,

49:56.622 --> 50:00.125
the water will boil off and come up
the shaft at very high pressure.

50:01.460 --> 50:03.754
The geological structures are
holding up well.

50:03.837 --> 50:05.297
The water table's looking good.

50:05.881 --> 50:08.717
I estimate another 60 meters
to reservoir penetration.

50:30.072 --> 50:31.114
700 meters deep.

50:41.416 --> 50:43.043
Drill housing pressure's rising.

50:44.461 --> 50:46.672
Helios Base, gonna need you
to boost CO2 compressor speed

50:46.755 --> 50:49.132
to keep tank pressure within the window.

50:50.175 --> 50:53.554
Copy, skip. Increasing compressor speed.

50:58.475 --> 51:01.770
Hey.
Keep an eye on the drill housing pressure.

51:02.437 --> 51:03.438
Yeah.

51:04.356 --> 51:06.275
710 meters.

51:06.775 --> 51:08.402
Pressure readings back to nominal.

51:08.485 --> 51:09.486
Copy.

51:15.284 --> 51:16.535
Looking pretty stable.

51:17.119 --> 51:18.954
Copy that, Helios Base.

51:20.414 --> 51:21.498
I gotta go off-line

51:21.582 --> 51:23.709
and run these numbers
before we penetrate the reservoir.

51:23.792 --> 51:26.044
Should have another 30 meters or so.

51:26.128 --> 51:28.922
So, you're on.

51:38.473 --> 51:40.058
Keep an eye on that pressure gauge.

51:40.142 --> 51:41.310
Louisa…

51:45.731 --> 51:47.316
Get the drill bit extension ready.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.986
Next well casing is prepped
and ready for insertion.

51:52.863 --> 51:55.073
730 meters.

51:56.491 --> 51:58.952
The drill is starting to speed up
earlier than we thought.

51:59.953 --> 52:02.164
We could be approaching penetration depth.

52:06.919 --> 52:08.420
740 meters.

52:09.338 --> 52:12.341
I'm easing off on the throttle.
Drill's bucking too much.

52:14.718 --> 52:16.011
Housing pressure's rising.

52:17.429 --> 52:18.972
Nearing penetration.

52:23.227 --> 52:25.479
-Watch pressure window.
-Watching.

52:29.149 --> 52:30.734
Helios Base, come in.

52:31.443 --> 52:33.237
Drill housing pressure is rising.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.948
I need you to boost compressor speed
to maximum this time.

52:36.490 --> 52:40.369
-Watch pressure window.
-Keep an eye on that pressure gauge.

52:40.452 --> 52:42.496
-Hold depth steady.
-Watch pressure window.

52:42.579 --> 52:44.164
The drill is under too much stress.

52:44.248 --> 52:45.749
Take it off. Helios Base, come in.

52:45.832 --> 52:48.961
We need you to increase
the compressor speed now.

52:53.715 --> 52:55.133
Helios Base, do you read?

52:56.301 --> 52:57.845
You don't think I've seen a pilot
on go pills before?

52:57.928 --> 52:59.805
-I can't back it off.
-Helios Base, come in.

52:59.888 --> 53:00.931
Keep an eye on that pressure gauge.

53:01.014 --> 53:02.182
Hit me!

53:02.266 --> 53:04.226
Come on. It's about to break off.

53:04.309 --> 53:05.519
-Shit.
-Housing pressure's rising.

53:05.602 --> 53:07.396
The housing is really vibrating.
It's a gas kick!

53:07.479 --> 53:09.523
-Mayday! Mayday!
-Housing pressure is rising too high.

53:09.606 --> 53:12.359
-It's a gas kick!
-Push the compressor speed now!

53:12.442 --> 53:13.443
Get out of there!

53:49.062 --> 53:50.856
Something's wrong with the comms.

53:51.982 --> 53:53.984
Are you getting any audio?

53:55.986 --> 53:57.738
Jesus Christ.

53:57.821 --> 54:00.365
Mayday! Mayday!
At least two injured.

54:00.449 --> 54:02.701
The drill-- Oh, God, it just came apart.

54:03.076 --> 54:05.120
Louisa, say again? Status report.

54:05.787 --> 54:07.414
We are loading them into the MSAM.

54:07.497 --> 54:10.209
-Get the med-bay ready!
-Alert Dr. Mayakovsky.

54:10.292 --> 54:12.211
The shrapnel went into his stomach.

54:13.545 --> 54:14.755
What did you do?

54:27.267 --> 54:30.437
Mayday! Mayday!
Inbound from the ridge. Two injured.

54:30.521 --> 54:31.563
Stay with me, Ed.

54:31.647 --> 54:33.398
Roger. What's your ETA?

54:33.482 --> 54:34.691
Thirty seconds till landing.

54:34.775 --> 54:36.527
Isabel, what's your status?

54:36.610 --> 54:38.529
My suit pressure is dropping.

54:38.612 --> 54:39.988
The puncture is bad.

54:40.072 --> 54:41.698
Calm down and keep your hand on it.

54:41.782 --> 54:44.034
Mayakovsky's
prepping the med bay in Hab 2.

54:44.117 --> 54:45.661
We are almost to the Habs.

54:45.744 --> 54:47.704
Copy that.
We'll meet you at the landing site.

55:11.645 --> 55:12.855
I've got Ed.

55:13.689 --> 55:15.357
Take him to Hab 2.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.402
I'm going to run ahead to the med bay
and help Dimitri prepare.

55:27.870 --> 55:31.248
-Louisa. Secure the MSAM.
-Copy, Nick.

55:31.331 --> 55:33.292
-You okay, Isabel?
-She needs to get to the med bay.

55:33.375 --> 55:35.669
Alexei, take one of her arms.
Help me get her into Hab 2.

55:35.752 --> 55:36.753
Is, let's go.

55:46.847 --> 55:48.473
It's gonna be okay, Ed.

56:06.241 --> 56:07.659
Oh, my God.

56:09.703 --> 56:10.787
Run!

56:11.872 --> 56:13.498
Everybody, run!

56:18.754 --> 56:20.464
Heading for Hab 1. It's closer.
