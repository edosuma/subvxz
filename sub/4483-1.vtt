00:37.204 --> 00:39.798
- What do you want?
- Why is this door locked, Andrew?

00:39.798 --> 00:41.546
I am getting ready for school.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.712
Open this door, Andrew.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.885
Listen to me. No, you're drunk.

00:47.885 --> 00:49.467
I am what?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.635
Excuse me?

00:53.303 --> 00:56.773
I said unlock the door.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.558
Andrew?

00:58.558 --> 01:01.145
Dad, it is 7:30 in the a.m.,
and you are drunk.

01:01.145 --> 01:02.794
Listen. You don't tell me if
I am drunk or not, you little shit.

01:02.995 --> 01:04.319
Aren't you?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.570
What are you doing in there, huh?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.697
- I am filming this.
- Huh?

01:13.282 --> 01:13.872
What?

01:13.872 --> 01:17.662
I bought a camera, and I am
filming everything from here on out.

01:30.382 --> 01:36.560
And it is yours right
now for only 46.50. Yeah.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.187
Mom? Mom.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.061
Hey.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.902
Say hello to my new camera for me.

01:45.902 --> 01:47.351
Who's the audience?

01:47.351 --> 01:51.280
Just the millions of people
that are watching at home.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.781
Do I look awful? No, no, no, Mom.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.832
You look... You look great.

01:55.832 --> 01:58.873
- It's a nice camera.
- Well, thanks, Mom.

02:07.210 --> 02:13.388
So, um, should I ask about
the camera or...

02:14.384 --> 02:18.389
Uh, I don't know. I am...
I am filming things now.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.601
- I am filming everything.
- You're filming everything?

02:21.601 --> 02:24.148
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.940
# Why is everyone so obsessed #

02:27.940 --> 02:30.659
# Money can't buy us happiness #
Wow.

02:30.659 --> 02:33.112
# We should all slow
down and enjoy right now #

02:33.112 --> 02:35.038
# Look to their left #

02:35.038 --> 02:36.615
# Everybody look to their right #

02:36.615 --> 02:38.166
God, make it stop.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.618
# Cha-ching, cha-ching #

02:39.618 --> 02:42.121
# Ain't about the...
yeah... ba-bling, ba-bling #

02:42.121 --> 02:44.548
# Want to make the world dance #

02:44.548 --> 02:47.297
# Forget about the price tag #

02:47.297 --> 02:50.175
Have you ever read any
Arthur Schopenhauer?

02:50.175 --> 02:53.052
No. What is Arthur Schopenhauer?

02:53.052 --> 02:56.135
He's, um... He's this philosopher
that I am reading at the moment.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.261
- For school?
- No, no.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.474
Uh, basically, human beings
have to recognize themselves...

03:01.474 --> 03:04.522
as beings of pure will, right?
Okay.

03:04.522 --> 03:09.232
So all emotional and physical
desires can never be fulfilled.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.488
So basically you're telling me
that I should give up on life.

03:12.488 --> 03:15.237
- Yes.
- Okay.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.161
- Come on, man.
- Oh, God.

03:18.161 --> 03:20.659
- I will see you later.
- All right, dude. Peace.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.915
Learning time.

03:22.915 --> 03:24.837
Get out of the way.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.090
Are you not coming in? I am
going to hang back a while, okay?

03:30.090 --> 03:32.671
Uh, you're going to be
late for first period.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.140
Yeah. I will pick you up after seventh.

03:36.198 --> 03:38.893
This is my school.

03:38.893 --> 03:40.812
I guess.

03:44.439 --> 03:44.892
Okay.

03:46.601 --> 03:50.196
Hey, you. Hey, guy. Vote for
Steve for senior class president.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.610
Vote for Steve. Yeah, I got it.

03:51.610 --> 03:54.034
This is where I eat lunch.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.745
Out here on the bleachers.

03:56.745 --> 04:00.120
...Four, five, six, seven, eight.
And one...

04:00.120 --> 04:02.951
Because I don't want to see
anybody pull up. That's right.

04:02.951 --> 04:06.709
Way to your left. There you
go, Jack. That's right. Okay.

04:06.709 --> 04:09.337
A cohesive unit today.

04:09.337 --> 04:13.258
...O-R-Y. V-I-C-T-O-R-Y.

04:13.258 --> 04:16.385
I don't want to see any
crap out there. All right?

04:16.385 --> 04:18.058
...T-O-R-Y.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.519
- Whoo.
- Good job. All right.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.269
Hi.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.564
Hey.

04:24.564 --> 04:28.018
Could you not videotape us,
please? It's really creepy.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.603
Uh, no. I wasn't.

04:29.603 --> 04:33.073
Hi. This is the hallway
where my locker is.

04:34.548 --> 04:35.697
What is this?

04:35.697 --> 04:37.403
What's up, Detmer?

04:37.403 --> 04:39.905
Wow, you should be on television.
Man, you're on a film, man.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.205
Pretty on camera.

04:41.205 --> 04:43.917
Smile, man. You look pretty.
You going to cry? You going to cry?

04:44.234 --> 04:45.786
Sean, come on. Give it back.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.793
Huh? You want your camera?
Piece of shit from, like, 2004?

04:48.793 --> 04:51.216
Here you go. Here she is.
In one piece.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.132
- Oh.
- Oh, guys.

04:54.132 --> 04:55.339
Almost.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.095
Assholes. Come on.

04:59.095 --> 05:01.685
All right.
You ready to bounce? Yeah.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.685
There's a party tonight.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.933
Okay.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.737
Haven Hills.

05:11.737 --> 05:14.031
Wait.
I thought Haven Hills was closed.

05:14.031 --> 05:16.073
It's abandoned, yeah.
What, you don't want to go?

05:16.073 --> 05:16.823
No.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.538
When was the last time you went
to a party? I don't go to parties.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.499
You're a senior. You are a
senior. I don't go to parties.

05:24.499 --> 05:26.493
Just come.
I will think about it, okay?

05:26.493 --> 05:27.828
Okay.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.381
But when we go tonight, Andrew,
can I give you, like, a pro tip?

05:31.381 --> 05:32.628
What?

05:32.628 --> 05:34.960
Maybe leave your camera at home.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.134
Why? Because it's a little weird.

05:38.134 --> 05:39.681
It serves a purpose.

05:39.681 --> 05:43.135
I am... I am just trying to
be a good cousin here, okay?

05:43.135 --> 05:45.346
This is me being your
friend and telling you...

05:45.346 --> 05:49.149
you should probably not
take the camera to a party.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.186
Okay.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.488
This is my street.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.530
And those are the official
douche bags of my street.

05:59.530 --> 06:01.403
What the hell's that? Oh, great.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.614
Hey. What you doing? Andrew.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.866
No, I wasn't... Don't film
me, Detmer. Don't film me.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.496
Run to your house, bitch.

06:07.496 --> 06:09.920
This is where I eat lunch.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.789
Out here on the bleachers.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.645
What do you want?

06:29.431 --> 06:32.651
When I say open that door,
you open the door. You got it?

06:33.351 --> 06:35.570
Finish your goddamn homework.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.810
Matt, are you sure it's here?
Dude, it's here. Calm down, okay?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.063
Oh, here it is.

07:14.484 --> 07:16.812
Oh, yeah.

07:16.812 --> 07:18.488
Wow. Look. A rave.

07:18.488 --> 07:20.531
Oh, wow. Look.
A nerd with a camera.

07:20.531 --> 07:23.198
What? Just don't follow
me around all night, okay?

07:23.198 --> 07:25.946
What do you mean? I thought... I
thought you wanted me to come with you.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.624
I did. I did. But just go and
do your own thing for once, okay?

07:29.624 --> 07:32.585
Just... have a beer, talk to people.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.334
I don't drink.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.271
Hey. Hey.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.825
Hey.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.118
Excuse me. Hey.
What are you filming for?

08:08.118 --> 08:09.573
Oh, I don't... Um...

08:09.573 --> 08:11.371
- Uh...
- What?

08:11.371 --> 08:14.043
- I can't hear you.
- I am just filming.

08:14.043 --> 08:17.023
Oh. Oh, cool. Cool.
I am filming for my blog.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.670
You should check it out.
It's actually... Andrew. Andrew.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.839
- Oh, hey. Hey, Casey.
- Hey.

08:21.839 --> 08:24.429
- How you doing?
- I am good. I am good.

08:24.429 --> 08:27.178
This is pretty lame, right?

08:27.178 --> 08:29.225
Why is it lame?

08:29.225 --> 08:31.974
You know, Jung said parties are just...

08:31.974 --> 08:34.806
people's way of seeking
widespread validation.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.938
I am not one to clamor
to be cool, you know.

08:38.938 --> 08:45.322
Wow. Way to put an analytical
psychology spin on this barn party, Matt.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.370
That's awesome.

08:48.370 --> 08:50.288
Awesome.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.200
- You're awesome.
- Hey, Matt.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.753
Hey, what did Jung
say about glow sticks?

09:09.466 --> 09:11.764
You filming my girlfriend?

09:13.136 --> 09:14.934
Yes or no?

09:14.934 --> 09:17.102
No, I... I am not filming anything.

09:17.102 --> 09:18.150
- I am just filming the party.
- Okay.

09:18.150 --> 09:20.727
I should break your
bitch-ass nose. You know that?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.778
- No, I wasn't...
- Don't talk back to me.

09:22.778 --> 09:24.777
- Bitch.
- Okay.

09:40.997 --> 09:41.837
Andrew?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.918
Andrew.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.587
Andrew.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.423
With the camera.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.676
- Can we... Can we use that thing?
- What?

09:52.676 --> 09:55.603
We found the craziest shit,
and we got to get it on tape.

09:55.603 --> 09:58.564
- Uh, it's not...
- What's up, man?

09:58.564 --> 10:01.525
- You okay?
- Yeah. I am... I am Andrew.

10:01.525 --> 10:03.274
Okay. I am Steve.

10:03.274 --> 10:05.647
- Steve Montgomery.
- Yeah, I know.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.902
Really?

10:06.902 --> 10:09.780
Matt and I were just hanging out,

10:09.780 --> 10:12.453
and we found this cool little...

10:12.453 --> 10:15.073
this thing.
Wait. You're with Matt?

10:15.073 --> 10:17.701
- You might want to get it on tape.
- No, I just... I don't really.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.663
Dude, just come on. Just come
get it on tape. It will be cool.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.915
- I don't know.
- Trust me.

10:22.915 --> 10:24.791
- All right.
- Yeah, man.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.002
You know there are, like, tons
of girls around here, right?

10:27.002 --> 10:29.964
And you're all by
yourself next to a tree?

10:29.964 --> 10:31.673
I am just really picky.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.787
- Listen. I really don't think...
- Is there a light on that thing?

10:33.787 --> 10:35.177
Like, on the camera?

10:35.177 --> 10:37.058
Uh, yeah. Here.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.849
What were you guys doing out here?

10:40.849 --> 10:45.275
A bunch of people were out here because
we were, like, obsessed with the thing.

10:45.275 --> 10:46.980
What thing?

10:47.814 --> 10:48.986
You will see.

10:48.986 --> 10:51.944
Oh, that's... that's right.
Andrew Detmer.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.028
I remember you from homeroom,
freshman year.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.285
You always had that gray zip-up hoodie.

10:56.285 --> 10:59.117
- Garetty.
- You remember that?

10:59.117 --> 11:03.797
Yeah, I got a... I got a thing for faces,
which is why I am going into politics.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.341
Ironically enough, because
I am so ridiculously hi...

11:06.341 --> 11:08.255
- Down here.
- Ah, there we go.

11:08.255 --> 11:09.969
- Garetty, what's up? I see you.
- Matt.

11:09.969 --> 11:13.090
- You see me?
- Yeah, where did everybody go?

11:13.090 --> 11:15.642
They left. They left. Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.344
- Do you see that?
- Guys, what is that?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.562
- Do you see it? Is that the camera?
- Yeah, I got him.

11:19.562 --> 11:22.311
Do you guys know how to get back from
here? Is it still making that sound?

11:22.311 --> 11:24.651
- Yes. Did you tell Andrew?
- Andrew, it's making that sound, dude.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.979
Dude, come and listen
to this. Listen to this.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.274
No, no, no, no. You got to get in.
Okay, okay.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.823
You got to get close, like literally almost in
the hole. Okay, don't push me. Just don't push me.

11:33.823 --> 11:37.413
Check this shit out. We're not going to push
you in. We're just trying to get it on camera.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.415
- Listen. Can you hear that?
- Shh, shh.

11:39.415 --> 11:41.255
What...

11:41.868 --> 11:43.495
I think we got it.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.296
Wait. How creepy is that?

11:45.296 --> 11:46.588
Is this sound coming up?

11:46.588 --> 11:48.963
I don't know. I mean,
probably. It's pretty loud, right?

11:48.963 --> 11:51.085
- Hello.
- All right, dude. We're going inside.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.046
- I am going back. Come on, you guys.
- I got to know.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.008
Matt, seriously, we...
Hey, wait, wait. Steve.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.099
Steve.

11:57.099 --> 11:58.927
Oh, shit. He's a ninja.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.512
Matt.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.814
Whoa, Matt, Matt, Matt.
What are you doing?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.900
Are you serious?

12:06.392 --> 12:09.612
- Andrew, can you give me some light?
- Matt, don't be an idiot.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.607
Whoop. Whoop.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.909
Matt. Matt, you're my ride home.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.680
Hello?

12:19.155 --> 12:19.905
Oh.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.831
Smells terrible. You guys.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.543
Matt.

12:34.003 --> 12:34.723
Hello?

12:38.341 --> 12:39.653
Andrew's such a pussy.

12:39.653 --> 12:41.766
All right. Does it go
down much deeper, or what?

12:41.766 --> 12:44.480
- Yeah, man. It goes really, really far.
- Andrew, bring the light.

12:44.480 --> 12:48.059
Look at the walls.
It's like a straight shot down.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.565
Probably already come
like 40 or 50 feet.

12:50.565 --> 12:53.068
Yeah, just don't talk about it, okay?

12:53.068 --> 12:57.118
You ever... You ever heard of
Plato's Allegory of the Cave?

12:57.118 --> 13:00.242
I don't know, Matt.
Let's just get this over with.

13:00.242 --> 13:01.447
Oh, shit.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.704
Holy shit.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.161
The hell is that?

13:07.186 --> 13:09.415
Matt, I am not kidding.
I can't breathe.

13:09.415 --> 13:11.841
- Come on.
- Andrew, look at this.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.294
What...

13:14.294 --> 13:16.505
Can you believe this?

13:16.505 --> 13:18.260
Matt.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.220
What am I looking at?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.356
- Ah, shit.
- I am freaking out right now.

13:27.356 --> 13:30.402
Matt.
Can we get out of here, please?

13:30.402 --> 13:32.478
Is it showing up
on the camera like that?

13:32.903 --> 13:34.070
I don't know, man. It's messing with
it. I don't really want to film...

13:34.070 --> 13:35.732
I don't know, man. It's messing with
it. I don't really want to film...

13:35.732 --> 13:37.783
Dude, I will buy you a new one.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.325
Touch one.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.910
Matt.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.038
- Matt, look at this.
- What?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.131
Look at this.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.089
Dude, what is...

13:56.252 --> 13:58.175
Dude, no way.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.699
- It's changing colors.
- Oh, my God.

14:01.699 --> 14:03.267
Must be reacting to heat.

14:03.267 --> 14:05.766
- I can't hear you over that...
- This is awesome.

14:05.766 --> 14:07.472
Oh. Dude, your nose.

14:07.955 --> 14:09.023
Steve, Steve.

14:10.698 --> 14:11.146
Steve.

14:11.146 --> 14:11.866
Steve.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.992
Matt, dude, put your phone down.
Turn it off.

14:23.992 --> 14:26.286
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Steve, you too.

14:26.286 --> 14:28.284
- All right.
- We have to document this.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.912
- Okay. Are you guys ready?
- Yeah. I am ready.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.756
All right. Here we go. Okay, Steve...
What?

14:33.756 --> 14:35.299
Can you move to your left?

14:35.299 --> 14:38.090
- Here?
- Um, yeah. That's good.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.426
And then, Matt,

14:41.464 --> 14:43.683
can you just go right
in front of Steve?

14:44.759 --> 14:45.976
Um...

14:45.976 --> 14:48.100
- Here?
- Yeah, perfect. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.852
This is the ball test.

14:49.852 --> 14:51.645
- You ready?
- Yep.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.602
Oh.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.233
What the shit, Steve?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.661
Get off. Get off.
What are you doing? Underhand.

15:03.661 --> 15:05.530
I tried, man. I tried.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.700
- Let's do it. Let's do it.
- All right.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.543
- All right. Wait, wait.
- We good?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.458
- We said underhand, right?
- Yeah, it is underhand. Yeah.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.754
Okay.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.505
Underneath. I am on you.
You're not going to get me this time.

15:18.505 --> 15:19.878
- You ready?
- Yeah.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.346
I am on it. Yeah.
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:22.346 --> 15:24.220
Let's go.

15:24.220 --> 15:24.970
Oh.

15:25.967 --> 15:29.062
Yeah. The crowd goes wild.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.226
- Yeah, I am ready.
- All right. Matt, beam him. Beam him.

15:31.226 --> 15:33.315
- I am... I am going to.
- Beam him.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.856
Oh.

15:35.856 --> 15:37.900
- Oh.
- No way. Shit.

15:38.379 --> 15:39.697
Wait, wait, wait. That's great.

15:39.697 --> 15:41.487
- He did it.
- I did it. I did it.

15:41.487 --> 15:43.280
- That is crazy.
- Oh, my God.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.903
- Look at it.
- Oh, my God.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.829
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God.

15:46.829 --> 15:48.702
Oh, my God. Oh, dude,
you're bleeding. You're bleeding.

15:48.702 --> 15:50.829
Oh, man, shit. Stop,
stop, stop. Get a tissue.

15:50.829 --> 15:53.794
You did it. Yes.

15:53.794 --> 15:56.380
- Oh. All right. Pop-up. Ready?
- Yeah.

15:59.658 --> 15:59.926
Yes.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.261
- Put on the music.
- Oh, yeah.

16:03.261 --> 16:04.261
Yes.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.175
Yes.

16:11.345 --> 16:15.646
Matt, you have... you have to pretend like
you're squeezing them together with your hands.

16:15.646 --> 16:19.446
That's what I am doing.
Look. That's what I am doing.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.780
I can't do it, dude. I give up.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.828
You do it.
You're better at this than I am.

16:27.828 --> 16:29.622
Oh, really? Am I? Really?

16:29.622 --> 16:31.449
Just do it.

16:36.621 --> 16:37.793
Oh.

16:38.714 --> 16:39.962
Sick.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.591
Dude, I hate you. That's...

16:44.295 --> 16:46.593
I am impressed, man. I am impressed.
That's amazing.

16:46.593 --> 16:48.140
That was awesome, dude.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.930
- Oh, no.
- Come on, dude.

16:49.930 --> 16:51.769
- That is not cool.
- What?

16:51.769 --> 16:53.479
- That is not cool.
- My Legos.

16:53.479 --> 16:56.566
You have been hanging out with those
two guys for the last three weeks.

16:56.566 --> 16:59.144
- Three weeks.
- I am not stupid.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.821
I think you're hiding something
from me. You better call me back.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.523
- Wow.
- I love you.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.983
I am going to get a brick through my
window. I am legitimately scared.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.365
I have an election coming up,
and I don't have time for this.

17:08.365 --> 17:11.163
Dude, why are you asking
us for advice on girls?

17:11.163 --> 17:12.912
Because we're his mistress.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.625
So, what, you think it's,
like, radiation or something?

17:17.625 --> 17:19.998
- Radiation from what?
- Dude, it's the government.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.799
What? Matt, what are you talking about?

17:21.799 --> 17:24.627
I am feeling pretty spelunked out actually.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.257
Andrew, relax.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.513
That's so weird. It looks
completely different during the day.

17:31.513 --> 17:34.638
Look. I don't care, okay?
I am not going in the hole again.

17:37.105 --> 17:37.807
Asshole.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.978
It's like sunk in or something.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.824
- There goes your old camera, dude.
- Oh, shit.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.493
That's weird.
I can still feel it down there.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.247
I can't believe we made
it out of there.

17:53.247 --> 17:56.542
Well, I mean,
that answers that, right?

17:56.542 --> 17:59.833
Um, what does?
We still don't know what happened.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.422
- No
- Well, we're still alive.

18:01.422 --> 18:03.633
- I mean, I was definitely...
- Hey.

18:03.633 --> 18:06.113
You kids can't be here, okay?
You got to move on out.

18:06.314 --> 18:06.878
What?

18:07.803 --> 18:10.303
The ground's unstable.
We're taping the whole place off.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.934
Okay. We're going.

18:13.934 --> 18:15.603
Vote for Steve.

18:15.603 --> 18:19.566
New camera's working out for you.
That's good. Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.109
Yeah, smaller.
Does that shoot on tape?

18:22.109 --> 18:25.027
No, it just... It, like,
records right onto the camera.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.741
No, I just want to record all the
stuff that we can do, you know.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.444
Yeah, but it's like all the time.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.621
You don't feel like it's a little weird,

18:33.621 --> 18:36.700
like it puts a barrier between
you and everything else?

18:36.700 --> 18:39.752
Uh, I don't know.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.747
Maybe I want a barrier.

18:42.747 --> 18:47.093
So, like, what's up with your dad?
What's his story? What does he do?

18:47.093 --> 18:50.217
Um, my dad's a firefighter.

18:50.217 --> 18:52.528
Okay. That's cool. Oh, man,
that must have been awesome...

18:52.528 --> 18:54.718
Yeah, well, he was, I guess.

18:55.259 --> 18:58.183
What happened? Uh, I don't know.
He didn't die or anything.

18:58.183 --> 19:01.641
He just... He got injured
on the job, and now he, um...

19:02.558 --> 19:04.560
he collects the insurance, you know.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.022
Um, so he doesn't really do anything.

19:07.022 --> 19:11.743
He just... He, um... He will go out during
the day, but I don't know where he goes.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.080
Uh, he drinks a lot.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.991
I know that much.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.579
I have actually been having some
problems with my parents too.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.164
Oh, yeah?

19:24.164 --> 19:26.123
Yeah. I mean, they're nothing like yours.

19:26.123 --> 19:31.213
I mean, not like that...
I just... Never mind.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.518
They just been fighting a lot lately.

19:37.518 --> 19:41.143
And I think my mom is
actually cheating on my dad.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.900
Can you not say anything about that?

19:47.900 --> 19:51.194
- Yeah. No way.
- Thanks.

19:52.316 --> 19:58.665
Yes. Karen Detmer. D-E-T-M-E-R.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.205
Yes. Thank you.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.963
She's in pain.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.712
She needs something stronger.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.882
Her breathing's worse.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.477
Sir, she's suffering.

20:20.477 --> 20:22.476
Please help me.

20:22.476 --> 20:26.105
I am on disability.
I can't afford $700.

20:27.643 --> 20:32.740
Please, don't put me on hold. She can't
breathe, okay? I don't know what to do any more.

20:38.069 --> 20:39.070
Is it on?

20:39.488 --> 20:41.616
Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.701
I want to remember you like this.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.707
Oh, Mom.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.002
You're stronger than this.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.922
Can you say that for me?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.507
Please?

21:02.678 --> 21:04.772
I am stronger than this.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.979
Oh, nice.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.441
All right. Here. Watch this.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.444
- Weak.
- Hey, Matt.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.164
Yeah?

21:22.865 --> 21:24.867
Do you like me?

21:26.994 --> 21:29.247
Um, yeah, of course.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.708
I mean, you know, I didn't...

21:32.666 --> 21:35.044
- I mean, you know, I didn't always.
- What do you mean?

21:35.044 --> 21:37.255
I don't know. Like, you haven't...

21:37.922 --> 21:41.597
You haven't always been super
easy to talk to, you know.

21:41.597 --> 21:44.224
I mean, I am not saying that
you're not now. I am just...

21:44.803 --> 21:46.806
You're such an asshole.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.438
That's what I am talking about,
dude. You're hostile, see?

21:54.321 --> 21:55.023
Better.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.903
- Hey, Matt.
- Yeah?

21:56.903 --> 21:58.905
Do you ever think about, like,

22:00.361 --> 22:02.489
doing more with it?

22:02.489 --> 22:04.323
What, with this?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.158
Not really.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.457
Why? What else is there?

22:08.457 --> 22:11.126
- Telekinesis.
- Yes. Do tell.

22:11.126 --> 22:14.004
The ability to move, lift, vibrate...

22:14.783 --> 22:16.552
That's my favorite.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.346
Spin, bend, break or impact objects...

22:19.346 --> 22:24.177
through the direct influence of mental
power or other nonphysical means..

22:24.177 --> 22:25.644
- Okay.
- Sounds familiar.

22:25.644 --> 22:27.388
- It does sound familiar.
- Very familiar.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.599
You want to see direct influence?

22:29.599 --> 22:30.584
Andrew.

22:35.912 --> 22:36.940
She's wearing black today.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.820
- Hi.
- That's direct influence.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.693
...week, in my room. Just listen.

22:40.693 --> 22:44.747
I am just that much stronger. Even last
night I got my whole bed off the ground.

22:44.747 --> 22:47.492
No nosebleed.
Yeah? I have been lifting weights too.

22:47.492 --> 22:50.374
This is my theory though
is that it's like a muscle.

22:50.374 --> 22:54.298
Like, it's elastic. If you stretch
it too far, too quick, it will tear.

22:54.298 --> 22:55.048
Ew.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.377
That's why I think we're
getting stronger, you know,

22:58.377 --> 23:04.049
because we're working it out,
getting buff. Buff.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.101
How about this for a workout?

23:07.544 --> 23:09.312
Holy shit.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.899
That was awesome.

23:12.874 --> 23:13.396
Classy.

23:13.396 --> 23:15.944
Mm-hmm. Attractive.

23:15.944 --> 23:18.819
I think it's time we took
this out of the backyard.

23:21.917 --> 23:23.820
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Right here. This is perfect.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.405
- Really?
- This is it.

23:26.287 --> 23:27.615
Matt. Yah.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.666
Let's get this one.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.252
Whoa. Hey. Hello.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.842
- Hey, what...
- Andrew.

23:41.842 --> 23:44.049
Help. Somebody grab that.

23:44.873 --> 23:46.426
Whoa. Whoa. Stop.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.937
Okay, I will get the top.
I will get the top. Got it. Got it.

23:50.937 --> 23:52.856
- Let's get the legs.
- Okay. Wait.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.026
I am flying.

23:55.026 --> 23:56.494
She's just looking at it.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.021
What you looking at, girl?
Stay in school.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.640
Okay, see the guy chewing the gum?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.117
I am going to get the gum and
pull it right out of his mouth.

24:03.117 --> 24:04.865
Okay, I got him.

24:08.864 --> 24:09.614
Oh.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.504
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are
we running? We don't need to run.

24:15.504 --> 24:17.126
- Five...
- I don't want to do it.

24:17.126 --> 24:18.674
- Four...
- Dude, I don't want to do it.

24:18.674 --> 24:22.011
You're creating a scene. I don't want to do
it. Come on, Matt. Don't be a bitch about it.

24:22.011 --> 24:23.929
Just do it.
Put your hand on the table.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.094
- Okay. Are you ready? Do it.
- Give me a countdown.

24:26.094 --> 24:28.058
- I will. I promi...
- Ow.

24:28.058 --> 24:29.635
Oh, snap.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.728
- Like I said...
- You got to pay for that now.

24:31.728 --> 24:33.597
- Like I said. See?
- Holy crap.

24:35.524 --> 24:35.923
Man.

24:35.923 --> 24:38.523
Just pretend that there's a barrier
over your hand, right? And then...

24:39.344 --> 24:41.193
When things are going to hit
you, as long as you're ready,

24:41.193 --> 24:43.675
they will not hurt you
because of the barrier.

24:43.675 --> 24:44.237
That's so sick.

24:44.237 --> 24:47.612
That's me right there. I need that.
Steve, Steve, you have to try this, dude.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.163
Give me your hand.

24:49.163 --> 24:54.290
When I was a kid though, I actually....
I actually did want to be a police officer.

24:54.290 --> 24:56.287
- A cop? No shit?
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:56.287 --> 24:59.712
You do know that you can't smoke
weed when you're a cop, right, Matt?

24:59.712 --> 25:03.044
Oh, no. Really? Uh, I didn't know.

25:03.044 --> 25:07.507
Uh, but, no, I... I... I just...
I really got into, like, altruism.

25:07.507 --> 25:10.138
What does that mean?
What does altruism mean, Matt?

25:10.138 --> 25:13.187
It's like wanting to make
things better for everyone.

25:13.187 --> 25:16.557
Really? This coming from the man who is
always talking about how pointless life is.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.359
Yeah, I know, but this is what
I have been thinking about lately.

25:19.359 --> 25:21.779
Like, I am looking back,
and I just think...

25:21.779 --> 25:25.449
the way I used to think about things
was probably a lot better, you know.

25:25.449 --> 25:29.825
So, what, you want to go out
and start a charity or something?

25:29.825 --> 25:32.824
- That's lame.
- Wait. Why is that lame?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.205
Uh, I don't know.

25:36.885 --> 25:37.537
Douche bag.

25:37.537 --> 25:40.498
I am not good at everything.
I just do my best at everything.

25:40.498 --> 25:43.209
All right? That's what it's about.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.465
I mean, you talk about
philosophy and shit all the time,

25:45.465 --> 25:48.138
but what has he really done, hmm?

25:48.138 --> 25:50.716
Have you even applied to colleges yet?

25:50.716 --> 25:52.676
No, but I am getting...
I am getting to it.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.054
Yeah, well, you should get to it.
I am just saying. I am.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.730
You could use some of that.

25:56.730 --> 25:59.399
You could use some Shut
the hell up. How about that?

25:59.399 --> 26:02.520
You just lack initiative. It's not
that big... Oh, yeah? You lack a dick.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.735
Boys, please tell us
what's going on here.

26:05.735 --> 26:10.035
Uh, well, it would seem that
a Virgin Mary has appeared...

26:10.035 --> 26:12.738
in the syrup of a local man's pancake.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.789
No, it has not.

26:14.789 --> 26:17.334
Uh, well, it will in a second, okay?
Just hold on.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.751
Oh, that is definitely some
supernatural shit going on here.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.260
Um, excuse me.
Can you come here real quick?

26:27.260 --> 26:29.839
Um, can you just look at that?

26:30.339 --> 26:32.512
Ay, Dios mio.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.975
Grounder. Too much pressure.

26:36.975 --> 26:38.556
Andrew.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.018
Oh, dude. Come on.
Leave her alone.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.610
Oh, seriously?

26:47.488 --> 26:48.361
Dude.

26:48.361 --> 26:50.033
Oh, come on. That is so messed up.

26:50.033 --> 26:51.652
- She's going to get fired.
- I didn't know...

26:51.860 --> 26:54.158
That is disgusting.
But do you guys share cups on the team?

26:54.158 --> 26:56.407
No, we don't share cups, man.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.242
You see that car though?

26:58.242 --> 26:59.998
- The red one.
- Yeah.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.000
All right. The gum was cool.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.710
All right. You tried.
It was a failed attempt though.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.542
Watch this.

27:09.542 --> 27:10.545
What are you doing? Watch.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.389
Go, go, go.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.769
What?

27:17.769 --> 27:19.768
No way.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.064
Holy shit.

27:24.064 --> 27:26.066
Dude. Holy crap.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.525
What? What?

27:31.525 --> 27:33.368
- That's what I am talking about.
- Did anybody see?

27:33.368 --> 27:35.286
Steve Montgomery for president.

27:35.286 --> 27:38.658
- I am having, like, a face period.
- Oh, man.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.037
Pause.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.833
You guys. You guys, here she comes.

27:42.833 --> 27:45.289
- Here she comes.
- Oh...

27:46.114 --> 27:48.133
Don't look. Don't look, don't look.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.755
Steve, don't look.

27:49.755 --> 27:53.055
She can't find...
She thinks it's stolen.

27:53.055 --> 27:56.676
She has no idea.
Yes, it was the black guy this time.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.060
I could have sworn I parked
it right here. Where is my car?

28:02.060 --> 28:03.641
Ignore us.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.943
We're just... Mormons.

28:05.943 --> 28:08.903
What does that mean?

28:08.903 --> 28:12.116
What does that mean?

28:12.116 --> 28:14.444
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.904
Garetty's...
Garetty's having a giggle fit.

28:18.512 --> 28:20.958
That was so... It was amazing.

28:20.958 --> 28:23.286
I know. Just take it
easy with the merchandise.

28:23.286 --> 28:26.042
How did nobody see that?
It was out in the open.

28:26.042 --> 28:29.167
Her face. I cannot get
her face out of my mind.

28:29.167 --> 28:30.671
That was awesome.

28:30.671 --> 28:32.048
Who is this?

28:32.048 --> 28:33.674
So many ideas of stuff that we can do.

28:33.674 --> 28:36.093
- Go around.
- That's just some redneck asshole.

28:36.093 --> 28:37.817
- Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.
- Go around.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.219
Take the camera. Take the camera.

28:39.219 --> 28:41.679
All right. Just make sure
it's zoomed out all the way.

28:41.679 --> 28:43.931
- Got you. I can see you.
- Okay, buddy.

28:44.314 --> 28:45.857
What you going to do?

28:45.857 --> 28:48.152
What the hell is this guy's problem?

28:48.152 --> 28:49.979
What are you doing?

28:49.979 --> 28:51.905
Abracadabra.

28:51.905 --> 28:54.074
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Andrew, shit.

28:54.074 --> 28:56.823
What the hell did you just do?
Matt, stop the car. Stop. Stop.

28:56.823 --> 28:59.618
Are you crazy? Pull down the road.
We got to go down there right now.

28:59.618 --> 29:01.073
Guys, I am sorry.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.534
What did you do?
Why did you do that?

29:03.534 --> 29:05.415
I didn't mean to. I didn't....

29:05.415 --> 29:07.667
Shit. What the hell is
wrong with you? Look at this.

29:07.667 --> 29:09.790
Will you just calm down.
The guy's probably still in there.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.625
I am sorry, okay?

29:12.668 --> 29:14.921
- Andrew, stop, stop.
- But I can... I can help.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.256
- I can get him out.
- Stop doing things.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.717
Steve. Steve.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.814
Steve, be careful.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.899
Shit. Shit.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.483
Oh, my God, Andrew.
Are you kidding me?

29:33.661 --> 29:33.939
Steve.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.901
Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:36.901 --> 29:38.986
Goddamn it.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.616
Steve.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.325
Andrew. Oh...

29:45.409 --> 29:46.535
Shit.

29:47.411 --> 29:50.255
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.921
Oh, Matt, he's got him.
He's got him. He's got...

29:53.921 --> 29:55.594
Help me.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.977
I will get in back of him.

30:03.977 --> 30:05.975
Get him up.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.614
Hang on. Steve, stay with him.
I am going to go get some help.

30:15.614 --> 30:16.948
- Are you calling the cops?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:16.948 --> 30:19.159
- Will you stop? I can't hear them.
- Will you hang up the phone?

30:19.159 --> 30:21.025
Yeah. It's just down past,
uh, White Crescent Bridge.

30:21.025 --> 30:21.574
Matt, he's fine.

30:21.574 --> 30:23.368
- Matt, he's fine.
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:23.368 --> 30:25.081
- Fine, Matt.
- Stop. Stop. I can't hear...

30:26.757 --> 30:27.251
Hey.

30:27.567 --> 30:30.041
Hey. Hey. Over here.

30:30.041 --> 30:33.262
...Peeled off the road and went
straight through the guardrail.

30:33.262 --> 30:33.962
Hey, is that on?

30:33.962 --> 30:34.929
...This is a game or something?

30:34.929 --> 30:37.177
I don't understand how
you guys can be so angry.

30:37.177 --> 30:38.720
You don't understand
how we can be angry?

30:38.720 --> 30:41.674
Andrew, you... you put somebody
in the hospital tonight, okay?

30:41.674 --> 30:43.179
Do you understand that?

30:43.179 --> 30:46.057
Andrew, look at me.
You put a guy in the hospital.

30:46.057 --> 30:49.060
How do you feel about that?
You hurt somebody.

30:50.865 --> 30:52.688
- Shit.
- We need rules, okay?

30:52.688 --> 30:55.021
Rule number one:
No using it on living things.

30:55.021 --> 30:58.198
Rule number two: You can't use
it when you're angry. That's it.

30:58.198 --> 31:00.153
Rule number three:
I don't think we should be

31:00.153 --> 31:02.070
using it in public or
telling anybody about it.

31:02.070 --> 31:04.913
Look, you can't just declare
rules, okay? I will declare rules...

31:04.913 --> 31:07.624
You're the one that said that
nothing matters. I will declare rules.

31:07.624 --> 31:10.669
If we're going to keep going, and
we're getting stronger, we need rules.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.246
We need rules, right?

31:13.747 --> 31:15.249
Matt's right. We need rules.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.894
Andrew. Answer the goddamn phone.

31:35.526 --> 31:35.898
Andrew.

31:35.898 --> 31:37.854
Matt, what did he say?

31:42.818 --> 31:43.990
Are you still mad at me?

31:43.990 --> 31:46.364
- No, I am not mad.
- Well, you seem mad.

31:46.364 --> 31:48.119
I am not mad. I just...

31:48.119 --> 31:51.498
I just think that we need to be more
careful now, you know? We can't...

31:52.494 --> 31:57.591
We have to think a little bit more. We can't
just do things. We have to think first, okay?

32:00.043 --> 32:02.091
- I understand.
- Okay.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.523
Why is Steve out in the boonies?

32:05.006 --> 32:06.508
Where are we?

32:06.508 --> 32:07.592
Steve?

32:08.885 --> 32:10.137
His car's right there.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.813
Yeah. Steve, where you at?

32:13.974 --> 32:15.692
Steve.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.771
Look up.

32:19.563 --> 32:20.735
Hello, boys.

32:20.735 --> 32:21.407
What?

32:22.482 --> 32:24.280
- What is up?
- No. No.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.327
Wait, guys. Wait, wait, wait.
Check me out. Hear me out.

32:26.327 --> 32:28.072
- You're flying.
- Holy shit.

32:28.072 --> 32:31.291
Wait, wait, wait. Hear me out.
Hear me out. No way. No way.

32:31.291 --> 32:32.492
What are you doing?

32:32.492 --> 32:36.581
It's much easier than it looks.
I swear. It's much easier than it looks.

32:36.581 --> 32:38.085
Oh, my God, dude.

32:38.085 --> 32:39.219
Make sure you catch yourself.

32:39.219 --> 32:41.460
Don't try and jump, or you will just
flip yourself. I got it. I got it.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.132
- Come on, Matt. Come on.
- All right.

32:43.132 --> 32:45.597
Oh, shit.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.299
Oh, man.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.926
- Eating dirt, man.
- Why don't you get behind me?

32:48.926 --> 32:51.144
- You were in my way.
- What do you mean?

32:51.144 --> 32:53.768
Think Harrier jet.
Think Harrier jet.

32:55.849 --> 32:57.692
Oh, man.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.978
- Goddamn it.
- Are you okay?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.525
- I am watching.
- Just let me concentrate.

33:01.525 --> 33:03.740
- Focus. Focus.
- Okay. Hold on.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.660
Is that your focus face?

33:06.660 --> 33:08.237
Oh, my God, dude.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.951
- Whoo.
- Bullshit.

33:10.951 --> 33:13.291
- I am up. I am up.
- Are you kidding me?

33:13.291 --> 33:15.160
- Holy crap.
- Hold it. Hold it.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.255
- Oh, my God, dude. I am doing it.
- Holy crap, dude.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.501
- Yeah.
- That's it, man. You're doing it.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.631
Whoo-hoo.

33:23.631 --> 33:26.847
Okay. Okay. Andrew, don't fart.
We will never find you again.

33:26.847 --> 33:28.799
Steve, stop me. Stop me, stop me.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.426
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa, whoa.

33:30.426 --> 33:32.928
- You are flying now.
- You guys look so cute together.

33:34.253 --> 33:36.933
I am coming up.
I am bringing the camera, okay?

33:36.933 --> 33:38.684
All right.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.854
All right. How do we get down?

33:45.982 --> 33:47.825
- Whoo-hoo.
- Yeah.

33:49.277 --> 33:52.372
Andrew. It's freezing up here.

33:52.372 --> 33:55.246
I can't hear you.

33:56.326 --> 33:57.873
Activate hyperdrive.

33:57.873 --> 33:59.500
Whoo.

34:02.821 --> 34:04.422
Where the hell are we?

34:04.422 --> 34:07.046
- Catch up. Let's go.
- What?

34:07.046 --> 34:12.496
- Whoo.
- This is insane.....

34:12.634 --> 34:14.181
Whoo-hoo.

34:14.181 --> 34:16.103
- Dude.
- All right, Andrew.

34:18.848 --> 34:19.815
Whoo.

34:19.815 --> 34:21.981
- Tag, you're it.
- Watch out.

34:21.981 --> 34:24.938
- Pump the brakes.
- Whoa. Aah.

34:24.938 --> 34:29.242
Hey, Matt.
You're finally good at something.

34:29.242 --> 34:31.991
It's so easy. Yeah.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.364
- Aah.
- Yeah.

34:36.658 --> 34:37.750
Whoo.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.501
Got it.

34:43.998 --> 34:47.128
Tebow time, baby.

34:47.835 --> 34:48.837
Yeah.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.799
- Oh.
- Nice hands, Steve.

34:51.799 --> 34:54.516
- Touchdown.
- Throw it back to Daddy.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.773
Oh, dude. Nice catch, man. Yes.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.274
- Steve. Go deep.
- Hey, Matt.

35:05.979 --> 35:08.198
Do you hear that?

35:09.065 --> 35:10.237
What is that?

35:10.900 --> 35:13.528
Whoa. Steve.

35:48.229 --> 35:51.699
Oh, shit. Almost died, dude.
Holy shit. Holy shit.

35:51.699 --> 35:53.573
Almost died, man. Almost...

35:53.573 --> 35:55.780
Andrew, you saved my life.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.335
Oh, my God. You saved my life.

35:57.335 --> 35:59.833
Oh, God, you saved my life.

35:59.833 --> 36:02.411
Oh, my God.

36:02.411 --> 36:04.371
- Okay.
- Holy shit.

36:04.371 --> 36:07.003
Is that the camera?
You saved me and the camera?

36:07.003 --> 36:09.050
Please tell me you got that on tape.
You have to...

36:10.752 --> 36:13.005
Ah, shit.

36:13.005 --> 36:15.090
- What the hell...
- We're alive.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.718
- What do you mean? The hell happened?
- You didn't see what happened?

36:17.718 --> 36:21.851
Oh, shit. Andrew. Andrew.
You're a genius.

36:21.851 --> 36:23.853
We got to see this. Holy...

36:23.853 --> 36:25.980
All right. Oh. Holy shit.

36:25.980 --> 36:29.734
Wait. Oh, God.
We're on the ground. Yes.

36:31.481 --> 36:32.778
We have broken history.

36:32.778 --> 36:34.825
I mean, I am talking about
since the caveman times.

36:34.825 --> 36:37.620
Uh, the Egyptians, the Wright brothers.

36:37.620 --> 36:40.119
Come here, Matt. Come here.
Get in here. Get in.

36:40.119 --> 36:41.450
Say it. I can fly.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.417
- I can fly.
- I can fly.

36:43.417 --> 36:44.878
- Oh, come on.
- Say it with your chest.

36:44.878 --> 36:46.462
- I can fly.
- Say it, Matt.

36:46.462 --> 36:48.798
- Shout it out.
- I can fly.

36:48.798 --> 36:50.716
I can fly. I can fly.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.885
I tried to save you, man.
Andrew was just quicker.

36:52.885 --> 36:54.087
How does that go again?

36:54.087 --> 36:56.138
We almost died.

36:56.138 --> 36:58.717
- Oh, please.
- Gestures...

36:58.717 --> 37:00.802
How does she not notice though?

37:00.802 --> 37:02.762
Come on. Let's be serious, guys.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.440
She definitely noticed
that it's gotten better.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.355
- You just got to be, you know...
- Yeah?

37:07.355 --> 37:08.902
You just got to be subtle.

37:09.677 --> 37:11.105
That is so cool.

37:12.021 --> 37:14.991
Dude.
And I haven't had sex since summer.

37:14.991 --> 37:17.910
I haven't had sex since ever.

37:17.910 --> 37:19.363
- Really?
- Really?

37:19.363 --> 37:21.956
- That is completely unacceptable.
- Well...

37:21.956 --> 37:25.035
How are you guys so cool?
How are you guys so cool, man?

37:25.035 --> 37:27.709
Liquid nitrogen.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.604
Hey, guys?

37:49.725 --> 37:51.478
Guys? You guys up?

37:53.062 --> 37:54.314
Yeah.

37:55.190 --> 37:59.366
Hey, uh... Today was like...

38:01.070 --> 38:05.746
It was like, I think,
the best day of my life.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.211
Like, I mean...

38:10.288 --> 38:13.542
I am thinking about it, and
I can't think of any day...

38:13.542 --> 38:16.720
that I liked better than today,
you know?

38:18.505 --> 38:22.510
I really... I think it was.

38:27.722 --> 38:28.974
Yeah.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.188
Unanimous.

38:34.188 --> 38:35.522
Yes.

38:35.522 --> 38:38.074
Okay. Good.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.112
Okay, check this out.
Say what you want,

38:42.112 --> 38:44.072
but I am thinking about booking
it to Maui for the weekend.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.494
- What's up with that?
- Seriously?

38:45.494 --> 38:48.167
Well, we could do it. I mean,
I was thinking the same thing,

38:48.167 --> 38:50.291
except I have always
wanted to go to Tibet.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.414
- Why Tibet?
- Tibet?

38:52.414 --> 38:53.999
Yeah. I don't know.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.834
It seems really beautiful,
you know, with all the...

38:58.586 --> 39:00.384
Will you shut up? Shut...

39:00.384 --> 39:03.554
The monuments and mountains,
you know? Mm-hmm.

39:03.554 --> 39:08.181
I don't know. And the monks have achieved
such a high level of enlightenment...

39:08.181 --> 39:10.982
that they can, like,
float and shit, you know?

39:10.982 --> 39:14.694
So we would fit right in. We could
really mess with their heads as well.

39:16.229 --> 39:18.778
Yeah, but, like, seriously,
I think we should go.

39:20.441 --> 39:25.038
It would be really cool. Peaceful.

39:25.038 --> 39:28.538
No, I think it's a really good idea.
I actually would like to go.

39:28.538 --> 39:30.459
I am down. You down, Steve?

39:31.578 --> 39:33.330
What... I... I don't know, man.

39:33.330 --> 39:36.587
There's no bikinis in Tibet. So I
don't know if I am down with that.

39:36.587 --> 39:40.178
It was brilliant. Oh, it was so amazing.
She might have lost her job.

39:40.178 --> 39:43.427
Oh, shit, dude.
I got my mom's birthday. I got to go.

39:43.427 --> 39:46.301
- It's Aunt Deb's birthday today?
- Yeah. I got to go. I got to go.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.558
- Tell her I said hi.
- Later, Matt.

39:49.558 --> 39:52.265
All right, what do you want to
do now? Where do you want to go?

39:52.265 --> 39:54.771
I don't know. I mean,
I don't want to go home.

39:54.771 --> 39:56.353
Oh, do you want to go into the city?

39:56.353 --> 39:58.654
Nah, it's rush hour, bro.
It's going to be so much traffic.

39:58.654 --> 40:00.232
So what?

40:00.232 --> 40:03.288
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Duh. Let's go.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.408
Oh, hey. Sorry, I just...

40:10.408 --> 40:11.158
Hi.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.458
Do you mind if I film you?

40:14.458 --> 40:17.962
Uh, a little bit. I don't really
like being on camera actually.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.845
Well, maybe it's,
like, exposure therapy.

40:21.845 --> 40:24.548
Yeah. No, I just came by to
give you something actually.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.304
- You did?
- Yeah.

40:28.801 --> 40:29.768
What?

40:29.768 --> 40:31.596
I was watching your, um...

40:32.972 --> 40:35.270
your... your... you know, your blog?

40:35.270 --> 40:37.899
There's a drought in the
Central African Republic, right?

40:37.899 --> 40:41.114
Yeah. So I saw that and I thought it
seems pretty cool, and it's cheap too,

40:41.114 --> 40:42.691
so I thought why not?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.576
- Totally.
- Yeah.

40:46.093 --> 40:50.574
Yeah, I can tell that you're
really global and big picture,

40:50.574 --> 40:53.292
- concerned about that kind of stuff.
- Yeah.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.793
You know, Matt, you can
just mail this yourself.

40:57.793 --> 40:59.340
I am not your mom.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.129
Okay. I mean, I just...

41:01.129 --> 41:04.053
What is this?
Is this, like, the new you?

41:04.629 --> 41:07.553
You got too smart to have fun
in eighth grade. So now what?

41:07.553 --> 41:08.633
No.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.184
Casey, Casey, Casey,
Casey, Casey, Casey.

41:10.184 --> 41:13.763
Listen, listen. Can I just
talk to you for a second?

41:13.763 --> 41:15.811
- Can I just tell you something?
- Mm-hmm.

41:15.811 --> 41:18.643
I just... I... I...

41:18.643 --> 41:21.479
I just want you to know I am
not, you know, who I was... now.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.360
You know, I am cool. I am just...

41:24.273 --> 41:25.320
You're cool?

41:25.320 --> 41:28.995
High school popularity just seemed
like this weird backward contest,

41:28.995 --> 41:30.947
and I thought since I knew that,
I could just...

41:30.947 --> 41:33.203
That made you better than everybody else.

41:33.203 --> 41:34.408
No. No, no, no.

41:34.408 --> 41:36.787
- I know what you mean.
- I would separate myself from that.

41:36.787 --> 41:38.163
- I get it.
- You get it?

41:38.163 --> 41:39.543
Mm-hmm.

41:39.543 --> 41:42.501
I know it sounds weird.
I just wanted you to know that.

41:42.501 --> 41:44.176
To know that you're cool.

41:44.176 --> 41:45.970
Wow, I really screwed this up.

41:48.798 --> 41:50.550
Not as much as you might think.

41:50.550 --> 41:51.892
- Really?
- Good-bye.

41:51.892 --> 41:53.390
- Casey...
- I got to go. Bye.

41:54.829 --> 41:55.931
Come on.

41:57.306 --> 42:00.981
Dude. When did you start doing this?

42:00.981 --> 42:02.479
- Like, since when?
- What, with the camera?

42:02.479 --> 42:04.030
- Yes, with the camera.
- Um...

42:04.030 --> 42:05.903
I don't know.
It's been a little while, I guess.

42:05.903 --> 42:07.780
See... Oh. I can't do that.

42:07.780 --> 42:10.032
I can't do stuff that requires finesse.

42:10.032 --> 42:13.240
I tried to type my name out yesterday,
and I cracked my keyboard in half.

42:13.240 --> 42:17.452
No, dude. It's really easy. You just...
You think that you're holding it.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.892
See, that's what I am
talking about right there.

42:19.892 --> 42:21.207
What?

42:21.207 --> 42:25.510
You're always thinking up
new shit that we can do, man.

42:25.510 --> 42:28.425
- This is insane.
- You know... I mean...

42:28.425 --> 42:29.676
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:29.676 --> 42:32.054
Yeah. Yes. I guess that I am.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.051
Whoo.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.226
Mom's, like, never home any more.

42:42.602 --> 42:46.323
I mean, you saw how my dad is.
He's just... quiet.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.783
Sits around.

42:48.783 --> 42:53.079
And it's pointless to talk to him about
it because he's got... nothing to say.

42:54.155 --> 42:56.249
See, it's different, because
you have always had friends,

42:56.249 --> 42:59.703
and people want to talk
to you and be around you.

42:59.703 --> 43:02.710
I never had any of that.
I mean, before this,

43:02.710 --> 43:06.425
I barely even hung out with
Matt, and he's my cousin.

43:06.425 --> 43:08.344
We were close when we were
little, but...

43:10.004 --> 43:12.598
I don't know. In high
school, everything changed.

43:12.598 --> 43:15.472
Ever been to the Space Needle?

43:15.472 --> 43:18.225
Yep. When I was, like, five.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.315
It's for tourists.

43:22.350 --> 43:25.604
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I went, um...

43:26.104 --> 43:27.981
I think I was, like, seven...

43:28.731 --> 43:31.951
with my dad one time and...

43:33.444 --> 43:35.538
I don't know.
It was actually a really good day.

43:36.322 --> 43:38.199
You remember that?

43:39.242 --> 43:42.365
Yeah. Actually, I do.

43:43.913 --> 43:45.631
You know,
I have been meaning to ask you.

43:46.124 --> 43:48.092
Winter break is coming up.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.803
You should do the talent show with me.

43:52.171 --> 43:53.468
No way.

43:53.468 --> 43:55.676
Why not? It'd be good for you
to get out there, you know.

43:55.676 --> 43:59.100
- Meet some people, meet some girls.
- Dude, I am not... it's just not...

44:00.388 --> 44:02.436
- What?
- Look, I am just really shy, okay?

44:02.436 --> 44:07.066
And I don't... I don't
even have any talents, so...

44:07.066 --> 44:10.194
What are you talking about, you
don't have... You have talent.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.739
You have got talent.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.363
Oh, dude, no way.

44:18.988 --> 44:19.957
You look handsome.

44:21.174 --> 44:23.123
Thanks, yes. Steve...

44:24.344 --> 44:29.172
let me borrow some of his clothes
to make me look cool or whatever.

44:29.917 --> 44:33.171
I am glad you're spending so
much time with your friends.

44:33.171 --> 44:36.554
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

44:47.977 --> 44:49.900
- Hey.
- What?

44:52.857 --> 44:54.359
How are you getting to school?

44:56.027 --> 44:58.871
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't bullshit me, you idiot.

44:59.488 --> 45:02.617
Matt doesn't come.
He doesn't drive up.

45:03.618 --> 45:06.838
You leave the house. Who the
hell's giving you rides to school?

45:07.914 --> 45:11.009
- M... Matt.
- All right. You know what?

45:11.009 --> 45:12.255
You're lying.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.391
You're up to something,
and you can't hide it.

45:19.133 --> 45:21.807
You think you can just slink, hmm?

45:21.807 --> 45:24.139
Sneak in,
sneak around my house, smiling?

45:27.183 --> 45:28.605
I am onto your shit.

45:30.377 --> 45:32.730
How do you even work
this stupid thing?

45:34.382 --> 45:37.576
Ah. And we're in business.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.174
# La, la, la, la, la #

45:59.215 --> 46:00.262
Boo.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.436
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:03.436 --> 46:05.684
Um, what are you doing here?

46:06.389 --> 46:09.768
I am filming for the talent show.

46:10.685 --> 46:14.440
Matt Garetty is filming for the
talent show. Yes, I am.

46:17.733 --> 46:20.577
What is this, some kind
of newfound school spirit?

46:20.577 --> 46:22.493
How do you like it, huh?
Being on camera?

46:22.493 --> 46:24.539
I actually don't mind being on camera.
Oh. Here we go.

46:24.539 --> 46:26.242
Ladies and gentlemen,
now coming to the stage...

46:26.242 --> 46:30.463
What? No philosophical comeback for me?
Steve Montgomery.

46:30.463 --> 46:32.336
You're probably going to
want to get this on camera.

46:32.336 --> 46:36.211
C.V. High, you guys
ready for a talent show?

46:38.212 --> 46:41.261
All my underclassmen, come on. Make
some noise. That's not loud enough.

46:42.591 --> 46:45.140
How about my upperclassmen?
Come on. Make some noise.

46:45.140 --> 46:46.311
Yeah, Steve.

46:46.311 --> 46:50.184
Let me hear it from my
seniors, class of 2012.

46:51.684 --> 46:54.563
Yeah. Shh.

46:54.563 --> 46:59.488
Now I want you guys to give it up for the
young and very talented Mr. Andrew Detmer.

47:02.278 --> 47:04.280
- And you're on.
- Come on, you all.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.578
- What are you guys doing?
- Let's go, let's go.

47:06.578 --> 47:10.670
Are you playing a prank on your cousin?

47:10.670 --> 47:12.788
That's mean, Matt.

47:12.788 --> 47:14.044
Just watch.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.632
Really?

47:22.214 --> 47:24.012
- Good luck.
- What's he doing?

47:24.012 --> 47:26.560
Show us some talent.

47:30.079 --> 47:31.149
Nice, Matt.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.781
Fifty-two Pickup. Pick them up.

47:40.975 --> 47:41.815
No way.

47:47.448 --> 47:48.698
Yeah.

47:50.451 --> 47:52.044
Whoo.

47:52.536 --> 47:54.334
Go, Andrew.

47:54.334 --> 47:56.507
What? What?

48:03.881 --> 48:06.225
- Are they going to walk on that?
- What do you think?

48:15.325 --> 48:16.819
He's got it.
He's got it. He's got it.

48:18.521 --> 48:20.194
Easy.

48:20.194 --> 48:21.774
Yeah, you got it.

48:22.650 --> 48:24.072
Holy crap.

48:25.152 --> 48:28.076
Yeah. Cakewalk.

48:28.076 --> 48:30.999
Give it up, give it up, give it up.

48:31.784 --> 48:35.630
Oh, my God. Andrew is so amazing.

48:39.834 --> 48:41.084
Whoa.

48:44.003 --> 48:45.927
Give it up. Let's go.

48:45.927 --> 48:49.097
- Seriously, how are they doing this?
- I don't know.

48:50.386 --> 48:51.638
Magic.

48:56.517 --> 48:59.111
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.

48:59.111 --> 49:03.734
- Whoo. Whoo.
- Andrew.

49:03.734 --> 49:06.446
Oh, my God. I can see...

49:06.446 --> 49:09.035
your head is, like, exploding
right now. What?

49:09.035 --> 49:12.788
This is the beginning of your
downfall. Hubris. Right there.

49:13.868 --> 49:15.745
- What's hubris?
- Ha, ha, ha.

49:15.745 --> 49:18.293
- No, what does hubris mean, Matt?
- Seriously?

49:19.039 --> 49:21.337
- What does seriously mean?
- What? I am....

49:21.542 --> 49:24.261
- Get in there.
- Don't push me, dude. I am going.

49:24.261 --> 49:26.304
Your fans await.
You're the man of the hour.

49:26.304 --> 49:28.641
- Look at this house.
- Oh, sick.

49:28.641 --> 49:31.010
- Dude, this place looks huge.
- I know.

49:31.010 --> 49:32.307
- It's enormous.
- Dude.

49:32.307 --> 49:33.808
Matt. Andrew.

49:33.808 --> 49:35.556
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Steve. Oh, my God.

49:35.556 --> 49:37.018
- Everybody's freaking out.
- Come on, man.

49:37.018 --> 49:38.355
Everybody's been waiting for you.

49:39.643 --> 49:41.486
V.I.P. coming through. Coming through.

49:41.486 --> 49:43.564
Andrew Copperfield coming through.

49:43.564 --> 49:45.695
Make way, make way.

49:46.734 --> 49:49.032
Matt, come this way.
Drew, over here.

49:50.571 --> 49:52.994
Andrew Detmer's in the house.

49:56.911 --> 50:00.415
- How are you feeling?
- I am... I am... I am doing good.

50:00.415 --> 50:03.172
- Yeah? Are you sure? Are you sure?
- Hey. Hey.

50:03.172 --> 50:04.172
- Hello.
- Andrew.

50:04.172 --> 50:06.842
- Magic is so hot.
- Oh, wow. Thanks.

50:06.842 --> 50:11.183
- So, do you not remember me at all?
- Um...

50:11.183 --> 50:13.010
- Monica, right? Monica.
- Yes.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.812
...Setting the camera down.
I am setting the camera down.

50:15.812 --> 50:16.897
- What...
- Oh.

50:16.897 --> 50:18.982
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

50:18.982 --> 50:21.602
Have you ever played that, over there?

50:21.602 --> 50:24.188
Uh, no. I have never
played that, over there.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.906
- No?
- Never.

50:25.906 --> 50:28.196
- I bet you're good at it.
- Uh...

50:28.196 --> 50:30.820
What, you just throw the ball
into the cups? Yep. Yep.

50:30.820 --> 50:34.916
I actually could be good at
that right now. Yeah?

50:34.916 --> 50:36.329
- Maybe.
- Let's find out.

50:36.329 --> 50:37.667
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Come on.

50:37.667 --> 50:39.162
- What?
- Come on.

50:39.162 --> 50:40.663
- Okay, okay.
- Come on.

50:40.663 --> 50:41.872
Okay, I am coming. I am coming.

50:41.872 --> 50:44.709
There you are.

50:47.503 --> 50:48.720
Amazing.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.719
That's what I am talking about.

51:06.313 --> 51:08.816
Yeah. Whoo-hoo.

51:08.816 --> 51:10.446
Hey, where is Andrew anyway?

51:10.446 --> 51:11.196
Oh.

51:13.070 --> 51:16.165
Andrew's upstairs with the
girl with the pink hair.

51:16.165 --> 51:17.958
What, like, they went together?

51:17.958 --> 51:21.253
That's my boy. Of course they went
together. What are you talking about?

51:21.253 --> 51:23.547
Hey, Andrew.
I hope you're seeing this.

51:23.547 --> 51:25.750
Congratulations, sir.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.676
I just wanted you to know, dude...

51:27.676 --> 51:31.426
I was really worried about
you before all this, you know?

51:31.426 --> 51:35.135
But, dude, things are going to
get so much better for you now.

51:35.135 --> 51:37.766
I really, really feel that.

51:37.766 --> 51:40.724
And I want you to know
I love you, you know?

51:40.724 --> 51:43.434
I love you, man. It's you and me.

51:43.434 --> 51:47.567
It's Detmer and Garetty,
extended family for life.

51:48.689 --> 51:50.737
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- No, man. Excuse yourself.

51:54.236 --> 51:55.909
Oh, man.

51:55.909 --> 51:58.380
When did I become the
one who's out here...

51:58.581 --> 52:00.331
- Hey, Matt.
- filming myself?

52:00.331 --> 52:03.504
Oh, hey. Hey, Casey.

52:03.504 --> 52:05.422
So what are you filming?

52:05.422 --> 52:07.295
Uh, it's just a thing.

52:07.295 --> 52:09.968
It's not like eye of
the storm or anything.

52:09.968 --> 52:13.389
Hey, I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you...

52:13.389 --> 52:15.887
I have really been... it's
been making me think a lot.

52:15.887 --> 52:18.310
I have been kind of
thinking about it in my...

52:18.310 --> 52:20.308
No, I have. Like, in my life.

52:20.308 --> 52:22.890
I have been thinking, if
I applied myself, what I could do.

52:22.890 --> 52:25.101
I could really...
I could change the world.

52:25.101 --> 52:27.853
- I mean, it's really been...
- You're drunk.

52:27.853 --> 52:29.529
What?

52:30.947 --> 52:32.821
Hey, Casey?

52:32.821 --> 52:36.700
I have basically been stalking
you since, like, sophomore year.

52:36.700 --> 52:38.998
Sorry, use of the word stalking.
I shouldn't have said...

52:38.998 --> 52:40.700
You want to get out of here?

52:41.950 --> 52:43.202
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

52:43.202 --> 52:44.787
Yes. Yes, definitely.

52:44.787 --> 52:48.044
Uh, I... I have to drop
off the camera first though.

52:51.168 --> 52:54.798
Okay, you guys are getting ready
to witness history, all right?

52:54.798 --> 52:57.759
I am like a proud dad right
now because behind these doors,

52:57.759 --> 53:00.264
Andrew Detmer becomes a man.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.523
He's a little boy behind there.
He's scared.

53:04.523 --> 53:06.191
He's like a butterfly, getting ready

53:06.191 --> 53:08.606
to emerge... Oh, God.
from a cocoon or some shit like that.

53:08.606 --> 53:10.688
Disgusting weirdo.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.815
- Wait. What happened?
- Ha-ha. Okay...

53:12.815 --> 53:14.692
- Is that...
- Out of my way now.

53:14.692 --> 53:17.070
- Oh, man.
- Monica, what happened?

53:17.070 --> 53:20.122
Drew. Drew. It's okay,
man. Don't worry about it.

53:20.122 --> 53:22.037
Look, it happens to the best
of us, okay? Dude.

53:22.037 --> 53:23.663
You had a little too much to drink...

53:23.663 --> 53:26.663
- You...
- Oh. Oh. Whoa, buddy.

53:26.663 --> 53:28.585
- The hell's going on, dude?
- Why are you laughing?

53:28.585 --> 53:30.211
Aw, man. All over my jacket.

53:30.211 --> 53:32.676
- Stop. Stop laughing.
- What are you talking about?

53:32.676 --> 53:35.797
- It's cool, man.
- No, it's not cool, Steve. Stop.

53:35.797 --> 53:38.765
- Stop what? It's cool, man.
- Will you just get out of here?

53:38.765 --> 53:40.509
- Get out. What's your problem?
- Drew, Drew.

53:40.509 --> 53:42.227
- You think this is funny?
- No, I am not laughing...

53:42.227 --> 53:43.269
Get out.

54:17.588 --> 54:18.588
Dad.

54:19.590 --> 54:24.391
Andrew. Please. I need my medicine.

54:24.391 --> 54:28.100
Mom's in pain, all right?
She needs her pills. Where are you?

54:31.977 --> 54:33.198
Where are you?

54:39.860 --> 54:40.782
Dad.

54:40.782 --> 54:46.706
Hoarding a $500 camera while your mom dies
in there? I mean, how selfish can you be?

54:50.954 --> 54:52.456
I went through your camera.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.377
What did you see?

54:57.878 --> 54:59.880
Just you being a loser.

55:01.215 --> 55:03.217
You think that those
people are your friends?

55:04.218 --> 55:06.471
Huh? They're not.

55:06.471 --> 55:08.271
You're an embarrassment.

55:09.097 --> 55:12.146
You're running around this
town, spending my money.

55:12.146 --> 55:13.773
Look at me when
I am talking to you.

55:13.773 --> 55:16.025
I didn't spend any of
your money, Richard.

55:16.025 --> 55:19.108
Because I don't have a dime to spend.

55:19.108 --> 55:21.694
Every last cent... Look at me.

55:21.694 --> 55:24.288
Every last cent goes to
school for you... School?

55:24.288 --> 55:26.452
and medication for your mother.
I go to a public school.

55:26.452 --> 55:29.577
I can't even pay for a goddamn... You
don't pay for a public school, you idiot.

55:31.328 --> 55:33.046
What did you call me?

55:33.046 --> 55:34.839
Did you call me an idiot, you shit?

55:34.839 --> 55:37.043
Did you call me an idiot? Huh?

55:38.085 --> 55:39.712
You piece of shit.

55:39.712 --> 55:42.924
Get up. I said get up.

55:42.924 --> 55:44.258
Get up.

55:47.928 --> 55:49.726
- I could crush you, you know that?
- Stop it.

55:49.726 --> 55:52.354
- Crush you.
- Get...

56:19.793 --> 56:21.420
Smile, Matt.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.343
- Oh, my God, Matt.
- Oh.

56:23.343 --> 56:26.175
Can we not do the camera
thing right now, please?

56:26.175 --> 56:28.473
What happened?

56:28.473 --> 56:31.852
Uh... It just started out of nowhere.

56:31.852 --> 56:34.225
Are you okay?

56:34.225 --> 56:36.026
My head hurts really bad.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.901
That's probably Steve
calling your cell again.

56:39.901 --> 56:41.448
I will call him back later.

56:41.448 --> 56:43.363
I think it's time to take...

56:43.363 --> 56:45.235
Matt. Matt. Come on. Oh, wow. I did
not expect this. Give me my... Whoa.

56:45.235 --> 56:47.996
Matt. Matt. Come on. Oh, wow. I did
not expect this. Give me my... Whoa.

56:55.495 --> 56:58.169
Hey. Hey, asshole.

56:58.169 --> 56:59.625
What are you doing up here?

56:59.625 --> 57:01.381
Just leave me alone, Steve.

57:01.381 --> 57:03.838
You can't be up here, dude.
This isn't safe.

57:03.838 --> 57:05.548
I don't want to talk to anyone.

57:05.548 --> 57:07.759
Bro. What are you doing up here?

57:07.759 --> 57:09.514
Leave me alone.

57:10.427 --> 57:12.805
How did you find me?

57:12.805 --> 57:15.357
I don't know, man.
My nose was bleeding.

57:15.357 --> 57:16.979
I heard your voice or something like...

57:16.979 --> 57:18.902
What the hell happened to your face?

57:18.902 --> 57:20.820
Nothing, man.
Just leave me alone.

57:20.820 --> 57:23.524
No, dude, that's not nothing.
That... Your dad.

57:23.524 --> 57:26.201
Your dad beat the shit out of you.
He can't do that to you now.

57:26.201 --> 57:28.529
Will you stop acting
like you give a shit?

57:28.529 --> 57:32.116
Dude. Why are you talking to me
like this? I am your best friend.

57:32.116 --> 57:33.951
I don't have any friends.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.082
You were never my
friend before any of this.

57:36.082 --> 57:38.880
I hang out with you and Matt,
like, every day.

57:38.880 --> 57:42.922
We're supposed to fly around the world
together. Don't you... Do you remember that?

57:42.922 --> 57:45.466
- You think I am...
- Stop. Just stop talking to me.

57:45.466 --> 57:47.806
Why won't you just leave me alone?
Come on, man.

57:47.806 --> 57:50.259
Steve, I am telling you,
get away from me.

57:50.259 --> 57:53.471
Get away from me now. Please.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.400
# Amazing grace #

58:00.400 --> 58:02.900
# Amazing grace #

58:02.900 --> 58:05.400
# Amazing grace #

58:05.400 --> 58:08.182
# How sweet the sound #

58:08.182 --> 58:12.036
# How sweet the sound #

58:12.823 --> 58:16.823
# That saved a wretch like me #

58:16.823 --> 58:20.823
# That saved a wretch like me #

58:24.793 --> 58:26.093
# once #

58:26.093 --> 58:28.093
# once #

58:28.093 --> 58:31.892
...who, by the power of God,
are safeguarded in faith.

58:31.892 --> 58:34.808
Even though you do not see him now,

58:34.808 --> 58:38.390
you rejoice with an
indescribable and glorious joy...

58:39.099 --> 58:41.443
as you attain the goal of your faith...

58:41.443 --> 58:43.441
the salvation of your soul.

58:45.605 --> 58:47.482
What are you doing?
You filming graves?

58:49.026 --> 58:51.529
- I don't get it.
- What do you care?

58:51.529 --> 58:54.205
You haven't been returning my calls.
Why aren't you returning my calls?

58:54.990 --> 58:56.492
- I have been busy.
- No, you haven't.

58:56.492 --> 58:58.043
Why aren't you returning my calls?

58:58.043 --> 58:59.620
I just don't feel like talking.

58:59.620 --> 59:01.713
- Turn off the camera.
- No.

59:01.713 --> 59:03.916
Andrew. Andrew, turn off the camera.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.378
Andrew? How did he get
struck by lightning...

59:07.378 --> 59:09.714
during a storm with no
recorded lightning strikes?

59:11.089 --> 59:12.215
How?

59:12.215 --> 59:14.267
And they found Steve out
in the middle of a field.

59:14.267 --> 59:17.354
Why would Steve go out in the middle of
a field during a lightning storm, Andrew?

59:17.354 --> 59:18.643
- I don't know.
- Why? What?

59:18.643 --> 59:20.395
I don't know what happened, Matt.

59:20.395 --> 59:22.067
I don't believe you,
okay? I don't believe you.

59:22.067 --> 59:23.510
I want you to turn off the camera...
No.

59:23.510 --> 59:24.437
and talk to me. Why?

59:24.437 --> 59:27.235
Because I want to have a conversation
with you. Don't tell me what to do, Matt.

59:27.235 --> 59:29.487
You can't tell me what to do.
Don't ever tell...

59:29.487 --> 59:31.360
- Give me... Shut it off.
- Get off of me.

59:35.489 --> 59:37.742
Andrew... Are you joking right now?

59:37.742 --> 59:40.668
Is this a joke to you? I...

59:46.792 --> 59:48.294
What did you do, Andrew?

59:48.294 --> 59:50.049
What did you do?

59:51.129 --> 59:52.756
Who am I supposed to tell about this?

59:52.756 --> 59:55.809
Who do I talk to?
Who do I talk to about this?

59:55.809 --> 59:58.888
Why won't you just tell
me what happened, Andrew?

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.153
Please believe me, Steve.

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.323
Please, it's just I...

01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:19.282
I don't know what I did. I...

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.619
I lost control, and...

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.208
and I am so sorry.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:29.127
This thing is just
becoming a part of me now,

01:00:29.127 --> 01:00:30.882
and I don't...

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.631
I miss you, Steve.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.560
...all the drills. Good.
We're all pretty good, right?

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.064
Get ready. Go.

01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:31.272
You guys? Do not hesitate.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.859
Did you hear who worked?

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:42.292
He was like...

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:48.505
Oh. Oh, Andrew.

01:01:49.522 --> 01:01:50.545
Dry off.

01:01:51.724 --> 01:01:52.342
Totally.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.172
Hey, Wayne.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:06.728
Okay, so, see this one here?

01:02:06.728 --> 01:02:09.810
This one I got really clean
because I did this little, like,

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:12.942
lasso thing around the root, you know?

01:02:12.942 --> 01:02:15.149
But then these two...

01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:18.406
these, I did not get as good.

01:02:18.406 --> 01:02:20.487
See how they're broken?

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:23.915
I think it's because I got them from the
middle, you know, instead of the root.

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:29.629
Oh. Sloppy.

01:02:29.629 --> 01:02:32.503
I have been doing a lot of reading,
you know, like, online about, like...

01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:35.756
just like evolution and,
like... and natural selection...

01:02:35.756 --> 01:02:38.088
and how, like,
there's this thing, right?

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:40.845
It is called the
apex predator, right?

01:02:40.845 --> 01:02:45.646
And basically what this is is the
strongest animal in the ecosystem, right?

01:02:45.646 --> 01:02:48.098
And as human beings,

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.434
we are... we're considered
the apex predator,

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:53.771
but only because, like, smaller
animals can't feed on us...

01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:55.605
because of weapons and stuff, right?

01:02:55.605 --> 01:03:00.365
The lion does not feel guilty
when it kills a gazelle. Right?

01:03:00.365 --> 01:03:03.162
You do not feel guilty
when you squash a fly.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:08.122
And I think that means something.

01:03:09.943 --> 01:03:11.873
I just think that
really means something.

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:24.805
This one I got really clean
because I did this little, like,

01:03:24.805 --> 01:03:26.386
lasso thing.

01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:34.687
Andrew, what happened at school? Huh?

01:03:34.687 --> 01:03:36.462
I need to go and pick
up my mom's medication.

01:03:36.462 --> 01:03:37.314
Oh, yeah?

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.946
You're going to break the rules again?
We're too strong for that now, Andrew.

01:03:39.946 --> 01:03:42.615
If you did that, you know what
I'd have to do. You'd have to what?

01:03:42.615 --> 01:03:44.784
- You have to start thinking.
- What would you have to do, Matt?

01:03:44.784 --> 01:03:46.365
There are consequences to what you do.

01:03:46.365 --> 01:03:49.163
You could not do anything to me because
I am stronger than you. Stop that bullshit.

01:03:49.163 --> 01:03:51.292
I know what you did. I am not
going to let you do it again.

01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:52.834
I am not going to
break your stupid rules.

01:03:52.834 --> 01:03:57.588
Okay? So just screw off
and stay out of my life.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.452
I can't breathe.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.373
Thank you.

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.465
- Karen Detmer.
- Just one moment.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.932
We're going to need a next...
day delivery.

01:04:45.932 --> 01:04:49.932
Co-pay on that is $750.83.

01:04:49.932 --> 01:04:53.353
Well, I don't have all that. Son,
I told your dad, and I will tell you.

01:04:53.353 --> 01:04:56.184
You can pay up front, and we
can order next... day delivery.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.816
- Other than that, I can't help you.
- Prick.

01:04:58.816 --> 01:05:01.151
I don't give a shit.
Do whatever you want.

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:23.460
Oh.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:33.222
# Ooh, yeah #

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:39.148
# Ziggy played guitar #

01:05:39.148 --> 01:05:42.606
# Jamming good with Weird and Gilly #

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:45.693
# And the Spiders from Mars #

01:05:45.693 --> 01:05:48.654
# He played it left hand #

01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:51.580
# But made it too far #

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.710
# Became the special man #

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:59.881
# Then he could leave them to hang #

01:05:59.881 --> 01:06:02.960
# They came on so loaded man #

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.592
# Well-hung and snow-white fan #

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:11.010
# So where were the Spiders #

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.597
Hey.

01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.273
Hey.

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:20.143
- Give me all your money.
- Uh, what? Who is that?

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.446
Doesn't matter who it is.
Just give me all your money or else.

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.907
Or else? Shit, man.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.868
Shit, man. Is that Andrew?

01:06:28.868 --> 01:06:31.321
It sounds kind of like
Andrew under there.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:34.248
And you got
Andrew's broke-ass backpack on.

01:06:34.248 --> 01:06:37.289
- Oh, you got a gat?
- I got a gat too, bitch.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:40.751
Dude.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.848
Whoa, dude.

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.625
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

01:07:58.625 --> 01:08:00.498
Come on, come on, come on.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:10.503
Hey.

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:39.115
The camera needs to stay
on for our investigation.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.959
Jesus Christ.

01:08:41.959 --> 01:08:44.584
Can I have a moment alone with my son?

01:08:44.584 --> 01:08:47.040
If he regains consciousness,
notify the officer outside.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.295
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:24.118
Oh.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.095
Your mother's dead.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:47.100
She died last night while
I was out looking for you.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.441
I came home, and, uh,

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:59.407
she was there in her bed.

01:09:59.407 --> 01:10:01.990
If I just could
have been there for her.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:07.499
I was always there for her when
you were out screwing around.

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:10.631
And this one time...

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.840
this... one time...

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.298
that she needed me,
and you took me away.

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.725
I want you to apologize to me.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:28.232
I know you can hear me, so I
want you to sit up right now...

01:10:28.232 --> 01:10:29.980
and apologize to me.

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:33.692
You selfish, selfish asshole.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.400
This is your fault.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.450
You.....

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.251
Do you hear me?

01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:48.748
Your mother is dead,
and it is your fault.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:53.883
Happy birthday.

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:56.586
Pound it? Pound it?

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.967
Go and get a present.
Go and get a present. Yeah.

01:10:58.967 --> 01:11:02.596
- Yes, the big one.
- Oh, my God. Matt.

01:11:02.596 --> 01:11:04.677
Matt, your nose again.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.438
Are you okay?

01:11:07.438 --> 01:11:11.230
- Oh, shit.
- Baby, you're really bleeding.

01:11:13.868 --> 01:11:15.363
Matt, your nose. Oh, my God.

01:11:15.363 --> 01:11:17.190
Did you hear that?
How can you not hear that?

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.033
- Hear what? What are you hearing?
- It's so...

01:11:19.033 --> 01:11:21.777
- Something's wrong with Andrew.
- Come in here. Casey.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.123
We apologize for the
delay, but as of right now,

01:11:25.123 --> 01:11:27.839
every news helicopter in Greater
King County... Oh, my God.

01:11:27.839 --> 01:11:29.039
is headed to Seattle.

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:31.371
Again, right now, we have
very little information,

01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:35.175
but if appears a bomb has gone
off at Ballard Community Hospital.

01:11:35.175 --> 01:11:37.251
Casey, come here. Come here.
Come here. Please. Please.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.504
- What? No, Matt. Are you seeing this?
- Where are your keys at?

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:41.506
- What? Matt...
- Just stay here. I will be back.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:44.760
- I just have to drive there, okay?
- Please, wait. Matt, please.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.888
Listen, Andrew's in trouble, okay?
Andrew's what?

01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:50.390
I am sure that Andrew is fine.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:54.648
Andrew needs me. I need to get to
the city. Tell me what's going on.

01:11:54.648 --> 01:11:56.855
Shit. I got to get...
Is that a roadblock?

01:11:56.855 --> 01:11:58.940
Nobody else is driving this way.
Talk to me.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.318
- Casey, I need to think, okay?
- Stop.

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:03.118
I got to find another way downtown.
Shit.

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:04.696
Go back and take the Madison exit.

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.415
Come on.

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:13.671
- Stay here, Casey. Stay here.
- Wait.

01:12:13.671 --> 01:12:15.373
Matt, wait for me.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:18.843
All units, report to
Ballard Community Hospital

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:21.505
Excuse me.

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:23.089
Sir, excuse me.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:27.227
Matt. What are we doing here?

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.558
Oh, my God.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:37.563
You got to put me down.
Please. Stop.

01:12:37.563 --> 01:12:39.272
You did this to me.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.444
Matt. Oh, my God.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:51.542
Holy shit. Holy shit.

01:12:51.542 --> 01:12:53.957
Matt. Casey, we got to go.
We got to go right now.

01:12:53.957 --> 01:12:56.084
Get in the car. Let's go.

01:12:56.084 --> 01:12:58.324
- Andrew's out of control.
- What are you talking about?

01:12:58.324 --> 01:13:00.627
I am so sorry.
I wanted to tell you. I...

01:13:01.027 --> 01:13:03.595
Oh, my God, Matt. Stop the car.

01:13:03.595 --> 01:13:06.299
It's going to crash. Holy shit.

01:13:07.124 --> 01:13:08.222
Oh, shit.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.889
- I am sorry. I am sorry.
- Get off the road now.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:15.316
Oh, my God.

01:13:15.316 --> 01:13:17.359
Hold on to me.

01:13:18.076 --> 01:13:19.979
It's not me, it's Andrew.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:24.526
Hold on.

01:13:24.526 --> 01:13:29.410
I can't stop it. I can't control
the car. I can't control it.

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:31.161
Shit.

01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:33.413
Andrew. Oh, God, hold on.

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:35.707
Hold on to me.

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:40.591
I can't get the door open.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:48.512
- Oh, my God.
- Andrew. Andrew, stop.

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:54.643
- Casey.
- Matt.

01:13:54.643 --> 01:13:56.732
Matt.

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:02.446
Help me.

01:14:04.465 --> 01:14:06.033
Casey, hold on.

01:14:11.571 --> 01:14:13.416
Matt.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.999
Stay here. Okay?
You have to stay here. Okay?

01:14:16.999 --> 01:14:19.206
Matt, please don't go. Matt.

01:14:19.206 --> 01:14:22.171
We got a car on fire under the
Needle. Possible casualties.

01:14:22.171 --> 01:14:25.298
We need emergency response now.

01:14:25.298 --> 01:14:27.551
I don't know how to describe this.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:33.094
That is the Needle we're looking
at, and as you can see, there are...

01:14:34.219 --> 01:14:35.392
You're not going to believe this.

01:14:35.392 --> 01:14:37.473
Are you seeing this?

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.067
Back away from the window.

01:14:43.067 --> 01:14:45.318
What the hell are they doing up there?

01:14:45.318 --> 01:14:47.901
Get down.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.205
Seventeen, beware.

01:14:56.205 --> 01:14:58.081
You are going to have to divert.

01:14:58.081 --> 01:15:01.039
Andrew. Andrew, look at me.

01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:04.547
This has to stop right now, okay?
This is really, really bad.

01:15:04.547 --> 01:15:06.252
Why did you catch him?

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:09.509
- Listen. Just focus, okay?
- I dropped him.

01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:11.678
- Why did you catch him?
- Andrew, this is not a game.

01:15:11.678 --> 01:15:14.226
Do you understand?
You're hurting people.

01:15:14.226 --> 01:15:16.770
You're weak, Matt. You're all weak.

01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:19.019
- Andrew...
- I am stronger than all of this.

01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:21.521
Andrew, listen to me, okay? Just...
Just... I need you to listen.

01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:23.352
Just focus for a second.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.859
Do not tell me what to do.

01:15:25.859 --> 01:15:29.033
I am trying to explain.
I got two individuals.

01:15:29.033 --> 01:15:29.989
They can't stop us.

01:15:29.989 --> 01:15:32.029
- It's not too late for us to go.
- It is too late.

01:15:32.029 --> 01:15:34.864
I am done. It's over.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.996
You treated me like shit.
You left me alone.

01:15:37.996 --> 01:15:41.124
Andrew, you're not alone up here.
I am here with you.

01:15:41.124 --> 01:15:43.877
I should have been with you all along.
But I am here now.

01:15:43.877 --> 01:15:47.301
And we can stop this right now,
you and me.

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:51.673
Andrew, we can just fly away.
We can get out of here.

01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:53.884
We can be family.

01:15:53.884 --> 01:15:56.890
Andrew. Andrew, look at yourself.

01:15:56.890 --> 01:16:00.140
- This isn't who you are.
- I am an apex predator.

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.565
What?

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:05.895
I am an apex predator.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.670
- No.
- No.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.744
Oh, my gosh. Call the police.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.340
Andrew, no.

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:45.651
Paul. Paul, stay away from the window.
Okay, okay.

01:16:45.651 --> 01:16:49.568
- Paul. Don't stand at the window.
- Are you seeing this? Hey.

01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:54.326
Stay down, babe. Stay down.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.678
Andrew.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:17.341
Two subjects down.
One injured, one mobile.

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:20.720
Andrew? Andrew, look at me.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.682
This is all going to be fine.
You're going to be all right, okay?

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:27.314
I am going to get you help, okay?

01:17:27.314 --> 01:17:29.646
All units, respond Code 4 to Denny Way.

01:17:31.228 --> 01:17:33.232
Get out of here. It's not safe.

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:37.578
Andrew? Andrew?

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.495
- Are you getting this?
- Don't move.

01:17:42.495 --> 01:17:44.418
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:17:44.418 --> 01:17:48.373
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. I need help. I need help.

01:17:48.373 --> 01:17:50.128
He appears to be held at gunpoint but...

01:17:50.128 --> 01:17:51.129
Oh, my God.

01:17:51.129 --> 01:17:54.379
- Arms up in the air.
- Don't shoot, please.

01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:56.429
He's hurt.

01:17:57.464 --> 01:17:59.057
- Get on the ground.
- Wait. Wait.

01:17:59.057 --> 01:18:01.477
- Do what he says.
- Now, get down.

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:04.772
- Do not get up.
- Get on the ground.

01:18:04.772 --> 01:18:06.849
- Please don't shoot.
- We will shoot you.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:10.402
- I am not going to do anything.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. The glass.

01:18:10.402 --> 01:18:13.113
Take him out.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.445
Leave me alone.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.380
Shit.

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:32.208
Whoa. Whoa. Wow.

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:48.857
We have multiple explosions.

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:51.068
- Get in position.
- We have them in our sights.

01:18:51.068 --> 01:18:53.771
We're covered. Hold it right there.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:57.150
No. Stop.

01:18:59.026 --> 01:19:00.778
We have you surrounded.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.952
No. Hands where we can see them.

01:19:03.952 --> 01:19:06.159
Stay down. Stay down.

01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:09.086
- Stay down.
- I repeat, do not move.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.502
Additional units on the far side.

01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:21.136
Yo, stay down.

01:19:21.136 --> 01:19:23.638
Stay down. Don't move.

01:19:23.638 --> 01:19:26.436
Andrew. Andrew.

01:19:26.436 --> 01:19:30.185
- Stop. Don't hurt them.
- Andrew.

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:33.435
Open fire.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:58.506
Andrew.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:04.391
Andrew. Andrew, stop.

01:20:04.391 --> 01:20:06.059
Please, stop.

01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:13.017
Andrew.

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:15.986
Don't make me do this.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:18.982
Stop.

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:39.210
...reports of casualties.

01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:43.093
At least two structures
have been destroyed.

01:20:43.513 --> 01:20:46.183
I think they're both down.

01:20:46.183 --> 01:20:47.510
Two men out.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:50.517
Show me right now eastbound on...

01:20:50.517 --> 01:20:52.894
Yes, sir. I am about two blocks away.
I see it.

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:55.268
Move up.

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:05.231
Hey. Oh. What are you doing?

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.241
Hey, Andrew.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.918
I just wanted to say that...

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.221
I am sorry and, uh,

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:13.012
I... I hope...

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:16.190
that you know that
I did what I had to do.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:20.019
You're not a bad person.
I know that.

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:23.021
That's all that matters.

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:26.901
And, uh, I want you to know...

01:22:26.901 --> 01:22:29.112
that I am going to be
better from now on.

01:22:29.112 --> 01:22:31.492
I am going to help people.

01:22:32.272 --> 01:22:33.950
I am going to find out what
happened to us down there.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:36.000
I don't care how long it takes.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.078
I am going to get answers.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:42.208
I am going to do it for you, and
I am going to do it for Steve.

01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:43.964
And...

01:22:43.964 --> 01:22:45.669
I just...

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.342
I love you, man.

01:22:51.825 --> 01:22:54.178
I didn't ever get a chance to tell you,

01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:56.229
but I love you.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.235
And guess what.

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.783
You made it.

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:23.006
Whoo-hoo.

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.427
Isn't it beautiful?

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:35.515
Good-bye, Andrew.
