00:33.800 --> 00:37.236
I'll be waiting for you there...

00:37.270 --> 00:39.500
in about one hour.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.747
You can trust me.

00:56.656 --> 00:57.782
Ah, signora,

00:58.892 --> 01:00.484
Grazie,

01:14.407 --> 01:16.170
Che cosa?

01:17.710 --> 01:18.972
Go on.
Go on!

01:34.961 --> 01:36.553
The end is too goy.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.858
Cut out one roll of the table.

01:37.897 --> 01:38.864
Okay.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.126
The signal was much too obvious.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.724
It kills the surprise.
Make it shorter.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.757
Okay, Monroe.

01:42.802 --> 01:43.996
What else?

01:44.037 --> 01:46.130
You wanted to see the beach
scene from Dark Moonlight,

01:46.172 --> 01:47.196
Right.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.730
Okay, Jack.

01:52.979 --> 01:55.277
No, no, don't go to him at all,
stay on her.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.014
You don't need him. Stay on her

01:59.119 --> 02:00.780
all the way down
to the edge of the sea.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.549
She's the one
we're interested in.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.854
Remember that scene
from Reaching for the Moon,

02:05.892 --> 02:11.091
when Bebe Daniels ran out of
the house, down to the lake?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.962
This is where we shot it.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.694
No, of course
you wouldn't remember,

02:15.735 --> 02:16.963
you're too young.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.970
I've been here
since the silent days.

02:19.005 --> 02:20.267
I knew them all.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.466
Did you know the Keystone Kops?

02:21.508 --> 02:22.475
All of them!

02:22.509 --> 02:23.942
What a bunch of guys.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.313
Shh.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.487
This was Minna Davis'
dressing room.

02:38.992 --> 02:43.793
She was taken ill
for the last time...

02:43.830 --> 02:45.627
in this room.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.633
That's her.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.501
She was beautiful.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.905
She was a great friend of mine.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.842
I remember we had
to call her husband.

02:57.877 --> 03:01.404
I called him myself.

03:01.447 --> 03:04.280
I remember that call well.

03:04.317 --> 03:08.549
I said, "Mr. Stahr...

03:08.588 --> 03:10.715
I'm afraid your wife
has been taken ill."

03:11.891 --> 03:13.620
He said, "I'll be right over."

03:15.929 --> 03:17.920
And this is where
it all happened.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.234
This is where Mr. Stahr was
when I called him.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.203
The administration building.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.830
That's where he still is.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.068
That's his office up there.

03:29.108 --> 03:30.666
Oh...

03:32.212 --> 03:33.907
Gee, it's so big!

03:33.947 --> 03:35.778
It's big, all right.

03:35.815 --> 03:38.784
They don't have anything bigger
in the whole world.

03:38.818 --> 03:41.480
How did they do the earthquake
in San Francisco?

03:41.521 --> 03:42.613
The earthquake?

03:42.655 --> 03:45.351
Well, there are various ways
you can do an earthquake.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.656
What you can do first is
rock the camera.

03:48.695 --> 03:49.662
You see?

03:49.696 --> 03:53.325
Or if you're in a room,
you can rock the set.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.163
I mean, you can rock the room.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.998
Then you throw in
a lot of dust...

03:57.070 --> 04:01.598
No, I wasn't asleep.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.075
When are you coming home?

04:04.110 --> 04:05.077
Mmm.

04:05.111 --> 04:06.578
Oh, I'm all right.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.581
I miss you, that's all.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.606
Oh, she's with her grandmother.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.947
She's fine.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.610
She has a new tooth.

04:13.653 --> 04:14.620
Mmm.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.622
How did it go?

04:16.656 --> 04:17.748
Oh, that's good.

04:17.790 --> 04:18.757
Mmm...

04:18.791 --> 04:20.486
When are you coming home?

04:22.695 --> 04:24.287
Oh... good.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.524
Beautiful baby.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.931
And you want me to meet you?

04:27.967 --> 04:29.400
Mmm.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.370
Next time
I'll be coming with you.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.667
Come on, come on.

04:33.706 --> 04:37.836
They owe me a little time off
at the club anyway.

04:37.877 --> 04:38.866
Oh...

04:38.911 --> 04:42.074
Couldn't be more boring
than being without you.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.640
Yes, me too.

04:44.684 --> 04:46.276
Bye, darling.

04:59.599 --> 05:00.566
Want me to go?

05:00.600 --> 05:01.726
Yes!

05:08.975 --> 05:10.237
No.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.747
Cut!

05:14.781 --> 05:15.748
Kill the arc.

05:15.782 --> 05:16.908
That's a print.

05:16.949 --> 05:17.938
That was really good.

05:19.018 --> 05:19.950
I mean, vey good.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.247
Give me a finder.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.448
All right, take it up.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.854
Your aspirin, sir.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.754
Strike the sofa!

05:28.795 --> 05:31.525
Pick up the phone, Hary.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.803
Pull the phone back, Fred.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.362
And watch
that cable!

05:40.406 --> 05:41.873
Makeup!

05:41.908 --> 05:43.398
That was really
vey good indeed.

05:43.443 --> 05:44.410
Makeup!

05:44.444 --> 05:45.433
You think so?

05:45.478 --> 05:46.945
It was absolutely terrific.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.378
It was really wonderful.

05:48.414 --> 05:49.506
It was shit.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.982
Here we go again, Billy.

05:53.019 --> 05:53.986
Listen, Didi,

05:54.087 --> 05:56.248
I have to tell you
it was exquisite.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.519
It was fake.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.287
It was false.

06:00.326 --> 06:01.759
Didn't you notice?!

06:08.668 --> 06:10.329
I want to do it again.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.270
You'll never do it better.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.671
I know I can play
that scene.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.698
I want to do it again.

06:16.743 --> 06:17.732
It was good for me.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.074
What?

06:20.413 --> 06:21.437
Didi...

06:21.481 --> 06:23.415
trust me.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.352
Thank you.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.391
I'm ready.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.863
Chief?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.032
Let's do it again.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.434
We're going to do it again.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.443
Bitch.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.603
Get it quiet now, damn it!

06:52.645 --> 06:53.873
All right, bring it down.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.403
Quiet! Quiet, damn it!

07:03.756 --> 07:04.723
Good night, Frank.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.724
Good night, Brian.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.350
Yo.

07:11.464 --> 07:14.194
Hary, I'm waiting!

07:15.635 --> 07:16.602
Night, boys.

07:16.636 --> 07:17.864
Night. See you tomorrow, Hank.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.337
-Goodnight. Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

07:26.345 --> 07:27.312
I love him.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.416
He's a genius.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.152
I've always wanted him to get
evey credit.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.148
You know that.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.712
But what about me?

07:37.757 --> 07:39.520
New York has forgotten me.

07:39.559 --> 07:40.526
No, no...

07:40.560 --> 07:42.858
New York has forgotten me.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.329
You want to know why?

07:44.364 --> 07:45.922
Because I'm too generous.

07:45.965 --> 07:46.932
It's my nature.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.594
I make life too easy
for them.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.501
You know what I am?

07:51.538 --> 07:56.976
I am the strong base upon which
Monroe Stahr rests.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.374
I'm loyal to him,

07:58.411 --> 07:59.537
and I'm loyal to New York.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.513
New York knows you're loyal...

08:01.548 --> 08:03.038
and New York respects you
for it.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.674
Well, New York
should be loyal, too.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.082
New York is loyal.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.086
To who?

08:07.120 --> 08:08.178
To you.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.121
All I want is recognition.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.748
You've got it.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.088
I want to see it.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.718
I want to see it right here
on this desk.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.319
I want to feel it.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.602
Just cut it out, would you?

08:24.604 --> 08:25.935
You see that bastard
touch my daughter?

08:26.005 --> 08:26.937
Who is he?

08:27.006 --> 08:29.634
Some goddamn writer.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.371
You know, I went down to the
writers' building this morning.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.779
I stood there and watched them
for 1 5 minutes.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.943
There were two of them there
didn't write a line.

08:38.985 --> 08:39.952
You can go right in.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.077
Thanks.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.325
Hi.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.760
Are you an actress?

08:55.802 --> 08:57.793
No, I'm just
Daddy's little daughter.

08:57.837 --> 08:58.895
Uh-huh.

08:58.938 --> 08:59.905
What are you?

08:59.939 --> 09:01.839
Oh, I'm just a lawyer

09:01.874 --> 09:03.239
from New York.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.176
She's too intelligent
to be an actress.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.906
She's graduating
from Bennington next June,

09:06.946 --> 09:07.913
with honors.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.778
I love actors, though.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.010
I don't need all this.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.211
Oh, sure you do.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.858
What's the matter,
don't you feel well?

09:19.892 --> 09:20.859
I don't feel so good.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.882
You want some bicarbonate?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.020
I feel so shaky.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.325
Here.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.390
What were you doing
with that writer?

09:27.433 --> 09:28.593
He's all right.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.069
Don't get too close
to writers.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.185
Jesus Christ!

09:59.732 --> 10:01.791
Cecilia, are you all right?

10:05.004 --> 10:06.699
Stahr!

10:15.248 --> 10:16.943
Brady!

10:16.983 --> 10:18.041
Brady!

10:25.058 --> 10:25.990
Hello?

10:26.059 --> 10:26.991
Yeah?

10:27.060 --> 10:27.992
Are you all right?

10:28.061 --> 10:28.993
What happened?

10:29.062 --> 10:30.154
Geez, yeah.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.391
We had an earthquake.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.195
Monroe, pick up the phone,
will you?

10:36.202 --> 10:39.296
Yeah.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.704
Yeah, I'll be right down.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.867
Robbie!

11:03.363 --> 11:04.330
Yeah!

11:04.364 --> 11:05.331
It's split!

11:05.365 --> 11:06.354
It's split all the way down...

11:06.399 --> 11:07.366
Help with that spot!

11:07.400 --> 11:08.958
Go on!

11:09.936 --> 11:11.096
Is that where
it's coming from?

11:11.137 --> 11:12.126
Yeah, that's it.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.365
Look at the water tower.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.634
Get a light on it.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.232
Get a light on
that pipe break!

11:16.275 --> 11:18.835
Where's the valve, Robbie?

11:18.878 --> 11:20.311
You know where the valve is?

11:20.346 --> 11:25.306
Robbie, they're shooting
on 1 7 and 24.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.784
See the gates are shut tight.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.282
French village is flooded, too.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.589
We'll get the pumps from
the tanks on stage nine.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.616
Okay.

11:35.661 --> 11:36.889
Robbie, we need more men.

11:36.929 --> 11:37.896
Oh, Christ,

11:37.930 --> 11:38.954
we need that head next week.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.665
Bring in the pumps
from stage nine!

11:45.705 --> 11:46.899
Stage nine.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.407
Watch those cables!

11:53.446 --> 11:55.038
Get the cables
out of the water!

12:20.673 --> 12:21.970
Whoa...

12:22.074 --> 12:23.268
All right, hold it, right...

12:24.377 --> 12:26.436
Whoa.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.447
I'm sory.

12:28.481 --> 12:32.110
We just followed the trucks in.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.411
Good evening, sir.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.045
Good evening, Kino.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.326
Is everything all right
at the studio, sir?

13:17.363 --> 13:18.990
Yes.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.089
Would you like some tea?

13:44.123 --> 13:45.351
No, thank you.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.256
Shall I turn off the lights?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.158
Yes.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.696
Darling, I've come home.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.073
Yes.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.202
Yes.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.270
I told you, one of them
wore a silver belt.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.613
How dare you ask me
that question?

14:13.486 --> 14:16.046
No, I don't know which one
wore it.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.112
Right.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.555
Cut!

14:18.591 --> 14:20.081
Well, find a cop on duty.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.184
Mm-hmm.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.593
And tell Robinson to call me
as soon as he wakes up.

14:25.231 --> 14:26.823
Which one, Monroe?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.561
Take six.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.364
No, wait, let's see it again.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.098
Roll it again, Jack.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.105
Stage 24,

14:33.139 --> 14:34.197
take five.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.605
Action!

14:37.777 --> 14:41.144
Yeah?

14:41.180 --> 14:42.670
You found the name?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.275
Oh, good work, good work.

14:47.687 --> 14:48.915
Uh-huh.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.583
Well, no, divide the name
between yourselves

14:51.624 --> 14:52.750
and ty evey one in the book.

14:52.792 --> 14:53.759
Okay?

14:53.793 --> 14:54.782
Good work.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.817
Hi.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.390
Will you go to the ball
with me tomorrow night?

15:02.435 --> 15:03.402
What ball?

15:03.436 --> 15:05.404
Screenwriters' Ball...

15:05.438 --> 15:07.497
down at the Ambassador.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.529
Oh, yeah.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.563
No, I don't think so.

15:09.609 --> 15:10.906
I might just come in late.

15:10.943 --> 15:11.967
Oh?

15:20.820 --> 15:22.422
So...

15:24.090 --> 15:25.648
Uh...

15:25.691 --> 15:27.886
So, when do you go
back to college?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.485
I've just got home.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.191
You get the whole summer off.

15:33.699 --> 15:34.666
I'm sory.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.827
I'll go back as soon as I can.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.734
Well, don't you want to?

15:40.206 --> 15:43.733
Well, I don't know.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.939
I'm pretty well educated.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.412
Maybe I should get married.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.745
Well, I'd mary you.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.409
I'm lonely, but...

15:51.451 --> 15:53.282
I'm too old and tired
to undertake anything.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.843
Undertake me.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.252
What?

16:04.330 --> 16:05.763
Undertake me.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.062
Oh, no, Cecilia.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.596
I've known you so long.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.366
I've never thought of you
that way.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.540
You don't use that line
this year.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.545
What?

16:19.579 --> 16:20.568
Nothing.

16:23.449 --> 16:24.438
Yeah?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.543
Mr. Stahr, Mr. Rodriguez

16:26.586 --> 16:27.780
is still waiting to see you.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.787
Oh, yeah. Send him in.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.788
I'm sory.

16:29.822 --> 16:30.789
These actors...

16:30.823 --> 16:32.450
Did you press that buzzer
with your foot?

16:32.492 --> 16:35.086
Yes.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.118
Of course not.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.687
But you will dance with me
at the ball.

16:39.765 --> 16:40.925
Sure I will.

16:42.802 --> 16:43.791
Hello, Monroe.

16:44.871 --> 16:45.838
Hello!

16:45.872 --> 16:46.839
How are you?

16:46.873 --> 16:48.363
Wonderful, really great.

16:48.407 --> 16:49.431
You look just wonderful.

16:49.475 --> 16:50.464
Thank you.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.444
I had to see you
in your office.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.506
Sit down.

17:03.923 --> 17:07.586
So... what's the trouble?

17:07.627 --> 17:08.651
I'm through.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.423
You're through?

17:10.463 --> 17:11.794
What do you mean,
you're through?

17:11.830 --> 17:12.798
Have you seen Variety?

17:12.832 --> 17:14.891
Your picture's held over
at the Roxy.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.925
It did 37,000 in Chicago
last week.

17:17.970 --> 17:18.959
I know.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.406
That's a tragedy.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.410
I'm in a tragic mess.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.433
It's...

17:31.017 --> 17:32.814
Well, what are you
talking about?

17:34.987 --> 17:36.181
It's Esther and me.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.348
Mm-hmm?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.379
I love her.

17:38.424 --> 17:39.391
She's my wife.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.392
Yeah?

17:40.426 --> 17:41.950
But I'm through.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.528
I'm washed up.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.691
It's gone.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.826
What's gone?

17:49.869 --> 17:51.029
I've gone.

17:53.005 --> 17:56.065
I'm ashamed to go to bed
with my wife.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.913
I know Rainy Day grossed
25,000 in Des Moines

18:04.016 --> 18:06.177
and broke all records
in St. Louis

18:06.218 --> 18:08.482
and did 27,000 in Kansas City?

18:08.521 --> 18:09.579
Kansas City.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.748
But here I am,

18:10.790 --> 18:12.917
afraid to go to bed
with my own wife,

18:13.025 --> 18:15.789
the woman I love.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.058
So I came to you, Monroe.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.059
I've been to a doctor.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.426
I've been to a cathouse.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.937
Ah.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.767
Yeah-- nothing.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.331
Nothing.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.343
So, l... so I came to you.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.946
Yes, you did, I see.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.689
Ah...

19:02.041 --> 19:04.407
I mean, we both came from
nowhere, from nothing, right?

19:04.443 --> 19:05.410
Right.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.105
What were you,
a messenger boy?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.113
That's right.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.580
I delivered groceries.

19:09.615 --> 19:10.582
Yeah.

19:10.616 --> 19:12.049
This is America.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.075
Look where we are now.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.419
I mean, look at this
office, look at you.

19:17.456 --> 19:18.445
Yeah.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.855
We both came from nothing.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.885
That's why I can talk to you.

19:23.929 --> 19:24.987
I understand.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.233
So, how is Esther?

19:28.267 --> 19:29.791
She's the greatest girl
in the world.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.802
She's my wife.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.860
Well, I know that.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.098
I mean, she loves me.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.265
Oh, I know, I know.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.933
500 girls marched
up to my house

19:35.975 --> 19:37.067
from the high school.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.577
I stood behind the curtains
and I watched them.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.579
I couldn't go out.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.911
I mean, if they knew...

19:42.948 --> 19:44.939
If my family knew...

19:45.017 --> 19:46.314
I watch myself on the screen

19:46.352 --> 19:47.944
and I want to puke!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.510
Mm.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.847
Look at me.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.224
All right, I'm a big star,

19:55.261 --> 19:57.126
but what's really
profound about me

19:57.163 --> 19:59.427
is that I'm a big star
with a big fan club

19:59.465 --> 20:01.228
-Yeah, l-I know.
-who actually loves his wife,

20:01.267 --> 20:03.428
so why would anyone want to play
these lousy tricks on me?

20:03.469 --> 20:04.436
You see what I mean?

20:04.470 --> 20:06.563
Sure, sure.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.237
So I came to you.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.705
Yeah.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.454
Oh, yes,
I see.

20:29.495 --> 20:30.894
Just play the part
the way I said.

20:30.930 --> 20:31.897
All right then

20:31.931 --> 20:32.898
Thanks, Monroe.

20:32.932 --> 20:33.921
Thanks.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.331
The doctor's here.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.630
Ah.

20:40.639 --> 20:41.628
Hi, Doc.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.369
Come on in.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.820
When are you going
to take that vacation?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.556
Soon.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.790
When?

21:04.830 --> 21:06.798
Oh, sometime
in five or six weeks.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.830
Getting any sleep?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.532
About five hours.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.205
Do you need any more pills?

21:16.242 --> 21:17.641
No, I'm fine.

21:19.845 --> 21:22.609
Any... pain?

21:24.416 --> 21:25.405
Some.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.886
They'll never get
writers unionized.

21:28.921 --> 21:29.910
You know why?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.090
Hello, Monroe.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.091
Gentlemen.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.092
Monroe.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.115
Gentlemen.

21:38.898 --> 21:39.990
Everything all right?

21:40.099 --> 21:41.088
Fine.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.729
I was just saying

21:43.769 --> 21:45.737
they'll never get
the writers unionized.

21:45.771 --> 21:46.738
You know why?

21:46.772 --> 21:48.899
Because they hate
each other's guts.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.499
They'd sell each other out
for a nickel.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.670
This man from New York
seems pretty set on doing it--

21:52.711 --> 21:54.144
the one who's coming out
to see me.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.147
What's his name?

21:55.181 --> 21:56.409
Brimmer.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.579
Brimmer.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.484
Communist, yeah.

22:02.521 --> 22:03.818
You mean a real Communist?

22:03.856 --> 22:05.687
Yeah, sure, a real one.

22:05.724 --> 22:06.884
I mean,

22:06.926 --> 22:08.416
some of these guys
are just jokers

22:08.460 --> 22:09.950
that call themselves Communists.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.895
And mostly they are fairies,
too.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.922
There are other aspects,
of course.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.263
Well...

22:15.301 --> 22:17.064
I'll find out next week.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.070
Better find out.

22:19.104 --> 22:21.971
The last thing we need
is a writers' strike.

22:22.074 --> 22:25.237
We got 1 6 pictures
going into production.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.437
I'll handle him.

22:26.478 --> 22:28.681
Monroe can handle him.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.145
Monroe can handle anybody.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.377
Anyway, mostly they are fairies.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.313
There are other aspects,
of course.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.988
Monroe, tell me, what do
you think of the idea

22:40.059 --> 22:41.754
to make Manon with
a happy ending, huh?

22:43.028 --> 22:45.087
It's been making money
without a happy ending

22:45.130 --> 22:46.324
for a centuy and a half.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.127
What about
the South American picture?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.564
We're going ahead with that.

22:52.604 --> 22:53.730
With the same budget?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.268
It's out of proportion.

22:59.311 --> 23:00.778
With that budget,
we have no chance.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.611
What do you think, Mr. Marcus?

23:08.487 --> 23:11.251
Monroe is our
production genius.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.349
I count upon him

23:13.392 --> 23:15.326
and lean heavily
upon him.

23:15.360 --> 23:20.889
The balance sheet last year
showed a $27 million profit.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.924
It's all due to him.

23:27.473 --> 23:29.407
You know who first told him
you were a genius?

23:29.441 --> 23:31.932
Guess.

23:31.977 --> 23:32.944
You.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.912
Right.

23:34.947 --> 23:35.971
Damn good of you, Pat.

23:36.014 --> 23:36.981
No, no.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.641
I admire a man, I say so.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.618
I want the whole world to know.

23:40.652 --> 23:42.677
Perhaps that's
because I'm lrish.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.621
The lrish are a vey
warm-hearted people.

23:44.656 --> 23:46.248
The Greeks are warm, too.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.883
I mean, ty to find me
a Greek Communist.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.086
You couldn't find one.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.494
But there's not a $2 million
gross in the county right now.

23:51.530 --> 23:53.521
Don't forget, we're in
the middle of a depression.

23:53.565 --> 23:54.532
I know that.

23:54.566 --> 23:57.262
I think we can count
on a million and a quarter

23:57.302 --> 23:58.394
from the road show,

23:58.437 --> 23:59.995
perhaps a million and a half,

24:00.072 --> 24:01.903
and a quarter of a million
abroad.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.535
But you have a budget
of a million, seven-five-o,

24:05.577 --> 24:08.171
and you say you expect
less than that in grosses?

24:08.213 --> 24:10.044
What about prints
and advertising?

24:10.082 --> 24:12.050
Distribution costs.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.245
Interest on the money...
and some profits.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.310
Yes, he's here.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.049
I'm not even sure
we'll gross a million.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.721
It's for you, Mr. Stahr.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.191
Thank you.

24:21.226 --> 24:22.193
Yes.

24:22.227 --> 24:23.216
Hello, Robin.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.163
Uh-huh.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.826
Good.

24:28.867 --> 24:30.562
Yes, leave the number
with Miss Doolin.

24:30.602 --> 24:31.591
I'll call later.

24:32.671 --> 24:34.605
You know, I'm fairly new
out here.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.734
Do I understand you to say that
you expect to gross

24:37.776 --> 24:40.506
a half a million short
of your budget?

24:40.546 --> 24:42.241
It's a quality picture.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.475
"Quality picture."

24:43.515 --> 24:45.244
What the hell are we...?

24:45.284 --> 24:48.310
We've played safe
for two years now.

24:48.353 --> 24:50.753
It's time we made a picture
that isn't meant to make money.

24:50.789 --> 24:52.916
Pat Brady is always saying
at Academy dinners

24:52.958 --> 24:54.949
that we have a certain duty
to the public.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.085
Okay.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.925
It's a good thing
for the company

24:57.963 --> 25:00.261
to slip in a picture
that'll lose money--

25:00.299 --> 25:01.891
write it off as good will.

25:03.302 --> 25:04.291
Gentlemen.

25:10.475 --> 25:12.170
Thank you.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.206
Boy.

25:20.385 --> 25:21.409
Mr. Stahr!

25:22.588 --> 25:24.522
Hey, that's a good spiral
you got there.

25:24.556 --> 25:25.523
-Hello, Monroe.
-Hi, Dan.

25:25.557 --> 25:26.524
-Sir.
-Yes, Wylie.

25:26.558 --> 25:27.525
Hello, Mr. Stahr.

25:27.559 --> 25:28.526
You going somewhere?

25:28.560 --> 25:29.527
Stage four.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.756
Listen, have you read my script?

25:31.797 --> 25:32.957
Uh, yes, I have.

25:32.998 --> 25:35.330
Well, what do you think of it?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.062
I think it's
an interesting script.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.364
Uh-huh.

25:38.403 --> 25:40.371
How come you have
two other writers on it?

25:40.405 --> 25:41.372
-Take it away!
-Who told you that?

25:41.406 --> 25:42.532
They're friends of mine.

25:42.574 --> 25:44.064
They didn't know I was doing it.

25:44.109 --> 25:45.667
I didn't know
they were doing it.

25:45.711 --> 25:46.939
We all found out this morning.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.708
I'm sory.
What can you do?

25:48.747 --> 25:49.714
That's the system.

25:49.748 --> 25:50.715
We're back!

25:50.749 --> 25:51.841
You invented that system.

25:51.884 --> 25:52.976
You've distorted the girl.

25:53.018 --> 25:55.282
By distorting the girl,
you've distorted the stoy.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.515
We're back.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.682
How?

25:58.724 --> 26:00.692
How have I distorted
the damn girl?

26:00.726 --> 26:02.626
I'm not interested
in your fantasies.

26:02.661 --> 26:04.219
Eddie.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.230
Eddie!

26:05.264 --> 26:06.231
Hello, Monroe.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.232
Hi.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.790
Listen, two people
at the sneak preview

26:08.834 --> 26:11.029
complained that Morgan's fly
was open for half the picture.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.195
What?

26:12.237 --> 26:14.102
Oh, it's probably just a couple
of seconds, but I want you

26:14.139 --> 26:15.606
to run the picture
until you find the footage.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.165
Have some people with you.
Someone will spot it.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.176
Sure, I'll take care of it.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.177
Okay.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.439
Hi, Cooke.

26:20.479 --> 26:21.741
You've given her a secret life.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.077
She doesn't have a secret life.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.343
You've made her a melancholic.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.407
She's not a melancholic.

26:25.450 --> 26:26.417
Mr. Stahr.

26:26.451 --> 26:27.418
How do you know?

26:27.452 --> 26:28.544
Because I paid 50,000 bucks
for that book,

26:28.587 --> 26:29.713
and because that's
the way I see it.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.586
-Mr. Stahr.
-Thank you.

26:31.623 --> 26:33.955
If I want to do a Eugene O'Neill
play, I'll buy one.

26:34.026 --> 26:37.985
The girl stands for health,
vitality, love.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.161
You've made her a whore.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.494
Now, you can work
with Beth and Charlie on this,

26:44.536 --> 26:45.969
or I'll take you off
the subject.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.096
It's up to you.

26:49.207 --> 26:50.731
So how do you want the girl?

26:50.776 --> 26:52.801
Perfect.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.106
Mm-hmm.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.448
Gee.

27:07.225 --> 27:09.523
And I always have admired you.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.394
Were you wearing a silver belt
last night?

27:12.431 --> 27:14.524
Yes, I was.

27:16.168 --> 27:19.934
I'm glad we got you.

27:20.038 --> 27:21.938
We didn't have much to go on.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.102
Oh, really?

27:25.143 --> 27:27.407
Who are you?

27:27.446 --> 27:29.937
My name is Monroe Stahr.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.381
I'd like to see you.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.077
There's a reason.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.949
What reason?

27:37.155 --> 27:39.487
Well, I'd like to talk
to you for a few minutes.

27:39.524 --> 27:40.684
To put me in the movies?

27:40.726 --> 27:43.422
No, that wasn't my idea.

27:43.462 --> 27:44.429
When?

27:44.463 --> 27:45.623
Tonight.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.824
Where?

27:46.865 --> 27:48.355
At your house?

27:48.400 --> 27:49.731
No.

27:49.768 --> 27:52.100
Somewhere outside.

27:52.137 --> 27:54.605
I'll meet you
somewhere at 9.:00.

27:54.639 --> 27:56.971
I'm afraid that's impossible.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.305
Oh.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.675
Uh...

28:00.712 --> 28:02.373
What about tomorrow?

28:02.414 --> 28:03.438
No, no, no.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.416
Okay, tonight, 9.:00.

28:05.450 --> 28:08.783
On the corner
of Webster and Park?

28:08.820 --> 28:10.481
Okay.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.854
Should I wear
the silver belt?

28:12.891 --> 28:14.017
Yes.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.498
Hello, Monroe.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.590
How's it going?

28:21.633 --> 28:23.601
Geez, I'm glad you came down.

28:24.836 --> 28:25.996
She's too old for me.

28:30.742 --> 28:33.404
See who it is.

28:37.115 --> 28:38.377
Hello.

28:38.417 --> 28:43.047
Oh, get these photographers
away from me!

28:43.088 --> 28:44.612
May l?

28:44.656 --> 28:45.782
No, let's go.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.958
These publicity men.

28:50.062 --> 28:50.960
How are you?

28:51.063 --> 28:52.655
I've got the damn curse,

28:52.697 --> 28:54.824
and I'm having
all these troubles

28:54.866 --> 28:56.356
with my frigging hair.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.891
Well, don't wory about it.

28:57.936 --> 28:58.925
It's like seaweed.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.733
They're using
the wrong shampoo.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.797
They're tying to screw me,
these bitches.

29:02.841 --> 29:03.808
On my word of...

29:03.842 --> 29:07.642
We're using
her favorite shampoo!

29:07.679 --> 29:10.341
Oh, darling, forgive me.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.180
Nobody likes me, or something.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.689
I love you, Didi.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.418
How do you think I look?

29:24.463 --> 29:27.762
How do you think I look
on the screen?

29:27.799 --> 29:29.699
You're going to be beautiful.

29:29.734 --> 29:31.725
You're a great actress.

29:35.073 --> 29:37.769
Isn't she a terrible bitch?

29:37.809 --> 29:39.470
You can't handle her.

29:40.912 --> 29:43.472
We'll have to call it off, Red.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.743
The picture?

29:44.783 --> 29:45.875
No.

29:45.917 --> 29:48.545
I'm putting Daditch on it.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.111
Oh.

29:50.155 --> 29:52.146
We'll ty some other time.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.715
Shall I finish this scene?

29:54.759 --> 29:57.489
It's being done now.
Daditch is in there.

29:57.529 --> 29:58.962
Well, what the hell
is he...?

29:58.997 --> 30:00.521
He went in when we came out.

30:00.565 --> 30:02.226
He read the script last night.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.502
You bastard.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.527
You bastard.

30:05.570 --> 30:08.368
Listen, you haven't touched

30:08.406 --> 30:10.397
what she's able to do.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.108
How about my coat?

30:15.146 --> 30:16.841
I left it on the set.

30:26.691 --> 30:27.919
Here it is.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.190
Okay, that's it.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.128
Yes?

30:37.168 --> 30:39.102
It's Mr. Brady.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.407
Yeah.

30:43.441 --> 30:44.408
Monroe,

30:44.442 --> 30:46.672
we've just had a call
from New York-- urgent.

30:46.711 --> 30:47.871
Do you have a minute?

30:47.913 --> 30:49.778
No, it'll have to wait
till morning.

30:49.814 --> 30:51.008
We can come in to you.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.073
-All I need is...
-Not now.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.682
Hi.

31:28.486 --> 31:31.114
Where are we going?

31:31.156 --> 31:32.316
I don't know.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.856
What about a hotel?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.829
No, I'll run you home.
Where do you live?

31:38.863 --> 31:40.831
Run me home?

31:40.865 --> 31:41.991
Mm-hmm.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.398
It's no hury.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.601
What's the matter?

31:47.872 --> 31:50.739
Don't you like me?

31:50.775 --> 31:53.972
I thought you liked me.

31:54.012 --> 31:55.707
I've been stupid.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.112
Last night I had an idea

31:57.148 --> 31:59.139
you were the exact double
of someone I knew.

31:59.184 --> 32:01.414
It was dark, and the light
was in my eyes.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.345
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.389
That's funny.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.690
Which way?

32:11.763 --> 32:12.923
Westwood.

32:16.167 --> 32:18.135
I'm an actress.

32:18.169 --> 32:19.830
Hmm.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.766
I'm going to be an actress.

32:22.807 --> 32:24.968
Mm-hmm.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.278
Listen, could you stop here
a minute, please?

32:33.318 --> 32:34.683
You said the end of the street.

32:34.719 --> 32:37.347
Yes, but I'd like to stop here
a minute, please.

32:39.724 --> 32:42.215
Could you wait a second?

32:51.302 --> 32:53.099
Kathleen?

32:53.138 --> 32:54.662
Edna?

33:04.382 --> 33:06.111
See him? There he is.

33:21.299 --> 33:22.561
Who is he?

33:22.600 --> 33:23.760
I think it was you

33:23.802 --> 33:24.769
he wanted to see.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.634
He telephoned me.

33:37.382 --> 33:39.646
I'm afraid we were rude
at the studio.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.948
Oh...

33:41.986 --> 33:43.453
We had no business there.

33:43.488 --> 33:47.219
Well, I hope you'll both come
and make a real tour--

33:47.258 --> 33:48.418
of the studio.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.655
Who are you?

33:53.498 --> 33:54.556
He's a producer.

33:54.599 --> 33:57.329
He got us mixed up.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.165
Phone me, will you?

34:00.972 --> 34:03.372
Good night, Mr. Stahr.

34:04.175 --> 34:06.040
Oh, good night.

34:12.449 --> 34:13.507
You're lrish.

34:15.085 --> 34:16.746
I've lived in London
a long time.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.279
I didn't think you could tell.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.313
Oh, yes.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.205
You've lived in London?

34:35.239 --> 34:37.071
Yes.

34:40.578 --> 34:44.172
I came out here
a few months ago.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.985
Was it me you wanted to see,
or Edna?

34:52.090 --> 34:52.987
Uh...

34:53.091 --> 34:54.614
I made a silly mistake.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.353
I thought you were wearing
the silver belt.

34:56.393 --> 34:58.988
Oh.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.155
But I wasn't.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.632
No, but it was you
who I wanted to see.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.396
Yes?

35:04.435 --> 35:06.369
Why?

35:06.404 --> 35:07.871
You reminded me of someone.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.133
So you're Mr. Stahr,
the producer?

35:13.178 --> 35:14.440
Mm-hmm.

35:14.479 --> 35:16.470
I suppose the girls are
all after you

35:16.514 --> 35:18.914
to put them on the screen.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.475
They've given up.

35:21.519 --> 35:23.453
You didn't want to put me
in the pictures?

35:23.488 --> 35:24.512
No.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.421
Good.

35:27.525 --> 35:30.892
I feel as if
I had my foot in the door.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.954
Like a collector.

35:32.997 --> 35:35.864
I'm sory,
I can't ask you in.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.433
Well...

35:50.682 --> 35:51.808
Is this all?

35:53.852 --> 35:56.412
Well, I do hope
we'll meet again.

35:58.756 --> 36:01.156
I'd be sory if we didn't.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.547
Good evening, sir.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.615
Good evening.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.150
Will you be running
a movie tonight?

36:41.299 --> 36:42.493
No.

36:47.305 --> 36:49.330
Shall I turn off the lights?

36:49.374 --> 36:50.636
Yes.

37:06.591 --> 37:08.081
Sit down, Mr. Boxley.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.263
I can't go on.
It's a waste of time.

37:12.263 --> 37:14.163
I can't go on.
It's a waste of time.

37:14.198 --> 37:15.756
Why?

37:15.799 --> 37:17.790
You've stuck me with two hacks.

37:20.004 --> 37:21.096
They can't write.

37:21.138 --> 37:22.833
And they... bugger up

37:22.873 --> 37:24.500
everything I write.

37:24.541 --> 37:26.270
Well, why don't you just
write it yourself?

37:26.310 --> 37:27.800
I have.
I sent you some.

37:27.845 --> 37:29.472
That was just talk.
We'd lose the audience.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.640
Talk?

37:31.682 --> 37:32.671
Mm-hmm.

37:32.716 --> 37:35.651
I don't think you people
read things.

37:35.686 --> 37:36.653
The men...

37:36.687 --> 37:39.121
The men are dueling...

37:39.156 --> 37:40.953
when this conversation
takes place.

37:41.058 --> 37:43.117
At the end,
one of them falls into a well

37:43.160 --> 37:45.754
and has to be hauled up...

37:45.796 --> 37:47.525
in a bucket.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.891
Would you write that
in a book of your own?

37:51.935 --> 37:54.495
Of course I wouldn't.

37:54.538 --> 37:58.338
I inherited
this absurd situation.

37:58.375 --> 37:59.967
Let me ask you,

38:00.077 --> 38:02.910
do you ever go to the movies?

38:02.946 --> 38:04.208
Rarely.

38:04.248 --> 38:05.840
Because people are always
dueling

38:05.883 --> 38:06.907
and falling down wells?

38:07.017 --> 38:08.075
And talking a load of rubbish!

38:08.118 --> 38:10.086
Listen...

38:10.120 --> 38:11.451
has your office got
a stove in it

38:11.488 --> 38:12.477
that lights with a match?

38:12.523 --> 38:14.650
I think so.

38:14.692 --> 38:16.626
Suppose you're in your office.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.423
You've been fighting duels
all day.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.486
You're exhausted.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.729
This is you.

38:26.770 --> 38:28.397
A girl comes in.

38:45.589 --> 38:47.181
She doesn't see you.

38:49.993 --> 38:51.517
She takes off her gloves.

38:54.198 --> 38:55.358
She opens her purse.

38:55.399 --> 38:57.594
She dumps it out on the table.

38:57.634 --> 38:59.898
You watch her.

39:02.172 --> 39:03.696
This is you.

39:06.477 --> 39:07.466
Now...

39:09.279 --> 39:13.716
She has two dimes, a matchbox
and a nickel.

39:15.652 --> 39:18.450
She leaves the nickel
on the table.

39:18.489 --> 39:21.549
She puts the two dimes
back into her purse.

39:21.592 --> 39:24.857
She takes the gloves--
they're black.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.621
Puts them into the stove.

39:28.665 --> 39:30.929
Lights a match.

39:30.968 --> 39:34.404
Suddenly, the telephone rings.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.242
She picks it up.

39:42.279 --> 39:44.372
She listens.

39:44.415 --> 39:48.408
She says, "I've never owned
a pair of black gloves

39:48.452 --> 39:49.612
in my life."

39:49.653 --> 39:51.143
Hangs up.

39:51.188 --> 39:52.314
Kneels by the stove.

39:52.356 --> 39:53.550
Lights another match.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.592
Suddenly,

39:55.626 --> 39:56.854
you notice...

39:59.062 --> 40:01.622
...there's another man
in the room...

40:06.136 --> 40:09.435
watching evey move
the girl makes.

40:41.472 --> 40:42.837
What happens?

40:43.974 --> 40:44.941
I don't know.

40:44.975 --> 40:46.840
I was just making pictures.

40:48.312 --> 40:49.540
What was the nickel for?

40:50.714 --> 40:52.181
Jane, what was the nickel for?

40:53.550 --> 40:54.915
The nickel was for the movies.

41:02.359 --> 41:04.793
What do you pay me for?

41:04.828 --> 41:06.819
I don't understand
the damn stuff.

41:06.864 --> 41:09.856
Yes, you do...

41:09.900 --> 41:12.232
or you wouldn't have asked
about the nickel.

41:21.778 --> 41:24.406
Well, Monroe's right.

41:24.448 --> 41:25.745
Lights.

41:25.782 --> 41:27.773
Needs about 20 minutes
out of it.

41:27.818 --> 41:30.981
Twice it just lays there
and goes to sleep.

41:31.054 --> 41:33.215
Well, I've got to go to
that damn writers' ball.

41:33.257 --> 41:35.282
I'll talk to you
tomorrow, Eddie.

41:36.493 --> 41:38.188
What's Eddie, asleep?

41:38.228 --> 41:39.195
Jesus.

41:39.229 --> 41:40.196
Goddamn movie

41:40.230 --> 41:41.595
even puts the editor
to sleep.

41:45.035 --> 41:46.002
He's not asleep,

41:46.069 --> 41:47.661
Mr. Brady.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.037
What do you mean,
he's not asleep?

41:52.376 --> 41:54.139
He's dead, Mr. Brady.

41:55.178 --> 41:56.145
Dead?!

41:56.179 --> 41:58.147
What do you mean,
he's dead?

41:58.181 --> 41:59.148
He-he must have died
during the--

41:59.182 --> 42:00.149
How can he be dead?

42:00.183 --> 42:02.174
We were just watching
the rough cut!

42:03.820 --> 42:05.287
Jesus, I didn't...
I didn't hear anything.

42:05.322 --> 42:06.584
Did you hear anything?

42:06.623 --> 42:07.715
Not a thing.

42:08.926 --> 42:09.915
Eddie...

42:09.960 --> 42:13.191
he probably didn't want
to disturb the screening,

42:13.230 --> 42:14.697
Mr. Brady.

42:23.006 --> 42:25.406
Good evening, Mr. Stahr.

44:08.779 --> 44:11.771
What are you doing here?

44:11.815 --> 44:15.080
I'm with Martha Dodd's party.

44:16.353 --> 44:18.378
What's your name?

44:18.422 --> 44:20.014
Kathleen Moore.

44:22.092 --> 44:24.117
Kathleen Moore.

44:24.394 --> 44:25.383
Hmm.

44:25.896 --> 44:27.955
How do you know her?

44:27.998 --> 44:29.431
Oh.

44:31.568 --> 44:34.935
I met her...

44:34.971 --> 44:36.905
recently.

44:38.608 --> 44:40.576
Are you married?

44:40.610 --> 44:42.305
No.

44:44.481 --> 44:45.971
I must go back now.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.847
I promised this dance.

44:51.254 --> 44:54.849
Can we have lunch
or dinner?

44:54.891 --> 44:56.859
No.

44:59.229 --> 45:02.460
It's impossible.

45:02.499 --> 45:05.491
I must go back.

45:05.535 --> 45:07.662
Thank you for the dance.

45:19.850 --> 45:21.647
Monroe?

45:21.685 --> 45:22.652
Monroe?

45:22.686 --> 45:23.653
Hi, Rod.

45:23.687 --> 45:24.779
Hello, Esther.

45:24.821 --> 45:25.845
Hello, Monroe.

45:25.889 --> 45:27.584
Monroe, come here.

45:27.624 --> 45:28.591
Isn't she wonderful?

45:28.625 --> 45:29.956
Isn't she beautiful?

45:29.993 --> 45:31.688
Stop.

45:31.728 --> 45:32.717
How are you, Esther?

45:32.763 --> 45:34.128
Great.
Really great.

45:34.164 --> 45:35.756
This is the greatest county
in the world--

45:35.799 --> 45:37.391
eveybody stands a chance
in this county.

45:37.434 --> 45:38.867
There's not going to be
no revolution.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.961
The only people who want
a revolution are the Communists.

45:41.071 --> 45:42.402
And the fairies.

45:42.439 --> 45:43.736
What kind of
a revolution

45:43.774 --> 45:45.071
-do the fairies want?
-A Communist one.

45:45.108 --> 45:47.702
What else?

45:47.744 --> 45:49.371
Do you think Stalin
likes homosexuals?

45:49.412 --> 45:50.379
Homosexuals, eh?

45:50.413 --> 45:51.573
Let me tell you something.

45:51.615 --> 45:53.105
You know, "homo" is
a Greek word.

45:53.150 --> 45:54.981
I come from Europe,
I'm Greek.

45:55.018 --> 45:56.986
That's why he knows so much
about Stalin.

45:57.020 --> 45:58.487
But Stalin ain't Greek.

45:58.522 --> 46:00.319
You're damn right he ain't.

46:00.357 --> 46:01.324
He's a faiy.

46:01.358 --> 46:02.882
He's a bastard, Communist,

46:02.926 --> 46:04.518
Russian faiy--
that's what he is!

46:04.561 --> 46:05.550
Calm down.

46:06.530 --> 46:07.497
Fleishacker,

46:07.531 --> 46:08.725
Iet me tell you something.

46:08.765 --> 46:10.733
After the revolution,

46:10.767 --> 46:11.734
you'll be the only safe one.

46:11.768 --> 46:12.792
You know why?

46:12.836 --> 46:14.394
Because they always need lawyers

46:14.437 --> 46:15.404
after a revolution

46:15.438 --> 46:16.769
to straighten out
the legal end.

46:19.276 --> 46:21.301
What do you think, Monroe?

46:21.344 --> 46:23.278
I think so, too.

46:28.151 --> 46:30.244
You know, uh...

46:30.287 --> 46:32.152
I saw Highway to Tomorrow,

46:32.189 --> 46:35.317
You're right.

46:35.358 --> 46:36.552
You take 20 minutes
out of it,

46:36.593 --> 46:37.821
you got a fine movie.

46:37.861 --> 46:38.850
Possibly.

46:38.895 --> 46:40.328
The shape's not too bad.

46:40.363 --> 46:41.591
The shape is good.

46:41.631 --> 46:42.962
You know why?

46:43.066 --> 46:44.966
Because Eddie is
one of the best cutters

46:45.001 --> 46:46.730
in the business.

47:09.292 --> 47:10.316
Where are you going?

47:10.360 --> 47:11.327
It's early.

47:11.361 --> 47:13.022
It's late.

47:13.930 --> 47:15.397
They talked as if
I'd been dancing

47:15.432 --> 47:16.592
with the Prince of Wales.

47:16.633 --> 47:17.600
Meet me tomorrow.

47:17.634 --> 47:18.601
Mr. Stahr?

47:18.635 --> 47:19.932
I've said I can't.
Isn't that enough?

47:19.970 --> 47:20.937
Not now.

47:20.971 --> 47:22.268
Can I talk to you
for one minute?

47:22.305 --> 47:23.272
Look, tomorrow is Sunday.

47:23.306 --> 47:24.432
Why don't you come
to the studio.

47:24.474 --> 47:25.532
I'll show you
around the studio.

47:25.575 --> 47:26.872
No, I wouldn't like
to see the studio.

47:26.910 --> 47:27.877
You wouldn't?

47:27.911 --> 47:28.878
Monroe, we have that...

47:28.912 --> 47:29.879
Excuse me.

47:29.913 --> 47:30.902
I say, Mr. Stahr...

47:34.885 --> 47:35.852
Look.

47:35.886 --> 47:37.148
Look, where would
you like to go?

47:41.958 --> 47:43.619
I'm a weak woman.

47:51.735 --> 47:54.932
If I meet you tomorrow...

47:54.971 --> 47:56.939
will you leave me in peace?

48:04.247 --> 48:07.808
No, you won't, will you?

48:07.851 --> 48:10.012
So I'll say no...

48:10.053 --> 48:11.213
and thank you.

48:13.023 --> 48:14.047
Going down.

48:15.392 --> 48:17.019
Oh!

48:18.361 --> 48:20.659
What does it take to get
you to leave a party?

48:20.697 --> 48:22.665
You're the one
who wanted to come.

48:22.699 --> 48:23.927
I only agreed to come

48:24.000 --> 48:25.433
because you said
we wouldn't stay so long.

48:25.468 --> 48:26.730
Not in the elevator.

48:31.641 --> 48:33.199
Main floor.

48:40.817 --> 48:42.307
They looked so strange
when I came in,

48:42.352 --> 48:45.116
as if they were furious at me
for not being somebody famous.

48:45.155 --> 48:46.122
I know another way out.

48:46.156 --> 48:47.783
Back up, back up,
let them through.

48:51.261 --> 48:52.785
How old are you?

48:52.829 --> 48:53.887
I've lost track.

48:53.930 --> 48:56.091
About 35, I think.

48:56.132 --> 48:57.827
Where are you from?

48:57.867 --> 48:59.459
I was born on the East Side
of New York.

48:59.502 --> 49:01.527
They said at the table
you were the "boy wonder."

49:01.571 --> 49:02.560
Ah...

49:02.605 --> 49:04.698
Where's your car?

49:09.612 --> 49:11.204
Listen, where will we
meet tomorrow?

49:11.247 --> 49:13.545
I'll come by,
and I'll pick you up at 2:00.

49:13.583 --> 49:14.572
Hmm?

49:14.617 --> 49:16.608
No...

49:16.653 --> 49:18.086
No.

49:34.804 --> 49:38.399
I'll meet you here,
the same spot.

49:55.291 --> 49:56.622
Have you been here all night?

49:56.659 --> 49:58.627
Yes.

49:58.661 --> 49:59.650
I'd like some tea,

49:59.696 --> 50:02.665
if it's a place
you're not known.

50:02.699 --> 50:05.600
There's a place on the coast
where they have a trained seal;

50:05.635 --> 50:07.330
he knows me pretty well.

50:07.370 --> 50:08.769
He bit me once.

50:08.805 --> 50:11.069
But he won't say a word
unless you're rude to him.

50:12.609 --> 50:13.667
What are you hiding?

50:15.512 --> 50:17.207
Nothing.

50:34.230 --> 50:35.219
What'll you have?

50:35.265 --> 50:36.232
Two teas.

50:36.266 --> 50:37.255
Right.

51:02.092 --> 51:03.252
Shake?

51:04.994 --> 51:06.256
See?

51:06.296 --> 51:07.285
He remembers you.

51:08.965 --> 51:10.865
This seal has the memoy
of an elephant.

51:10.900 --> 51:12.128
He likes him...

51:13.169 --> 51:14.604
'cause he's such a charming guy.

51:14.737 --> 51:16.295
Does he respond to affection?

51:16.339 --> 51:18.864
He responds to fish.

51:18.908 --> 51:20.671
This seal's got taste.

51:20.710 --> 51:21.677
Come on out.

51:21.711 --> 51:22.678
Seat.

51:22.712 --> 51:24.373
How long have you known him?

51:24.413 --> 51:25.380
Oh, I've known him

51:25.414 --> 51:27.143
for years.

51:27.183 --> 51:29.242
His father's
an old friend of mine.

51:29.285 --> 51:31.719
But the family histoy
ain't too good.

51:31.754 --> 51:33.688
His mother ran off
with another seal.

51:35.024 --> 51:36.252
Is he good to you?

51:36.292 --> 51:37.987
Well, he's good to me
on the whole.

51:39.328 --> 51:40.420
Only got one problem.

51:40.463 --> 51:42.522
He won't ride in the backseat.

51:42.565 --> 51:43.964
That's right--

51:44.000 --> 51:46.264
climbs over the back
and rides in front.

51:46.302 --> 51:48.167
Now, I know
he's a good driver...

51:50.573 --> 51:52.006
But who owns the car?

51:52.074 --> 51:53.006
Right?

51:53.075 --> 51:54.007
Right!

51:54.110 --> 51:56.977
Here.

51:57.013 --> 51:58.742
Give him this.

51:58.781 --> 52:00.373
Whoa. Thanks.

52:23.339 --> 52:25.273
Well, this is it.

52:38.621 --> 52:41.522
I don't know
why I'm building it.

52:41.557 --> 52:43.525
Maybe it's for you.

52:43.559 --> 52:44.856
Well, I think
it's great of you

52:44.894 --> 52:45.986
to build a big house for me

52:46.062 --> 52:48.087
without even knowing
what I look like.

52:54.070 --> 52:55.799
I didn't know what kind
of a roof you wanted.

52:58.274 --> 52:59.639
I don't need a roof.

53:04.146 --> 53:05.272
What's that for?

53:05.314 --> 53:06.508
The projector.

53:06.549 --> 53:07.516
The what?

53:07.550 --> 53:09.677
The movie projector.

53:18.027 --> 53:19.927
I gave a luncheon
out here last week,

53:19.962 --> 53:22.829
so I had some props
and grass brought out

53:22.865 --> 53:24.696
to see how the place felt.

53:24.734 --> 53:26.725
Is that real grass?

53:26.769 --> 53:27.736
Sure.

53:27.770 --> 53:28.862
Is it from a film set?

53:28.904 --> 53:30.303
No.

53:30.339 --> 53:31.397
Can I walk on it?

53:31.440 --> 53:33.203
Walk.

53:33.242 --> 53:35.073
I'll watch you.

54:11.647 --> 54:13.808
Will you live here alone?

54:13.849 --> 54:14.873
Yes.

54:16.085 --> 54:17.882
Alone with your movie projector?

54:17.920 --> 54:19.444
Mm-hmm.

54:19.488 --> 54:20.716
Where do you live now?

54:20.756 --> 54:21.882
I live in my old house.

54:27.630 --> 54:29.962
What's this?

54:30.065 --> 54:31.692
Oh, the, uh, swimming pool.

54:31.734 --> 54:34.362
Or it will be
a swimming pool.

54:34.403 --> 54:37.839
Well, you need a constant supply
of Nereids to...

54:37.873 --> 54:39.465
plunge and gambol.

54:39.508 --> 54:40.497
Nereids, what's that?

54:41.977 --> 54:43.604
Sea nymphs.

54:46.582 --> 54:47.776
Oh, no.

54:47.817 --> 54:49.512
I'll just come out here
to read scripts.

54:49.552 --> 54:51.213
No distractions.

54:59.161 --> 55:01.595
I lived with a man
for a long time.

55:01.630 --> 55:04.394
Too long.

55:04.433 --> 55:05.422
I wanted to leave,

55:05.467 --> 55:08.630
but he couldn't let me go.

55:08.671 --> 55:10.798
So finally I ran away.

55:14.643 --> 55:17.942
I must go now.

55:18.013 --> 55:19.537
I have an appointment.
I didn't tell you.

55:20.683 --> 55:22.514
That's not true,
but it's all right.

55:29.024 --> 55:30.252
Thank you, I must go now.

55:32.127 --> 55:33.651
We'll do it again?

55:33.696 --> 55:34.822
No, I'm sory,

55:34.864 --> 55:37.196
I'll... write you a letter.

55:38.934 --> 55:40.458
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:59.021 --> 56:00.921
Do you ever go to the movies?

56:01.991 --> 56:04.084
Oh.

56:04.126 --> 56:05.115
Not much.

56:05.160 --> 56:06.627
Why not?

56:06.662 --> 56:07.924
Should l?

56:07.963 --> 56:10.227
Millions of people do.

56:10.266 --> 56:11.358
Why?

56:11.400 --> 56:13.368
Because movies are necessay
to them.

56:13.402 --> 56:14.767
They give them what they need.

56:17.306 --> 56:18.773
What you need.

56:20.042 --> 56:21.134
It's my life.

56:44.867 --> 56:46.300
Have you got them?

56:48.037 --> 56:49.368
Yes.

57:49.865 --> 57:51.730
This wasn't my idea.

58:18.260 --> 58:20.524
Let's go back.

58:20.562 --> 58:22.757
To your house on the beach.

01:01:08.096 --> 01:01:10.087
Watch your head.

01:01:37.426 --> 01:01:39.053
Comfortable?

01:01:49.538 --> 01:01:52.006
I wonder when it's settled.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.268
What?

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:57.871
I mean, there's a moment
when you needn't,

01:01:57.913 --> 01:01:59.608
and then there's another moment

01:01:59.648 --> 01:02:01.775
when you know that nothing
in the world

01:02:01.817 --> 01:02:03.944
can keep it from happening.

01:02:04.052 --> 01:02:05.451
Hmm.

01:02:17.766 --> 01:02:19.859
I know why you liked me
at first.

01:02:19.901 --> 01:02:20.925
Edna told me.

01:02:20.969 --> 01:02:22.596
What did she tell you?

01:02:22.637 --> 01:02:24.696
That I look like Minna Davis.

01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:28.134
Hmm.

01:02:30.479 --> 01:02:32.310
You were happy with her?

01:02:32.347 --> 01:02:34.838
I don't remember.

01:02:34.883 --> 01:02:37.374
You don't remember?

01:02:37.419 --> 01:02:38.579
No.

01:02:42.424 --> 01:02:44.790
I remember what
she looked like,

01:02:44.826 --> 01:02:47.818
but I don't remember
what we were like.

01:02:57.572 --> 01:02:59.699
She became vey professional.

01:02:59.741 --> 01:03:01.936
She was vey, vey successful.

01:03:02.043 --> 01:03:05.240
She answered
all her fan letters.

01:03:08.717 --> 01:03:10.344
Eveyone loved her.

01:03:18.393 --> 01:03:21.419
I was closest to her
when she was dying.

01:03:34.042 --> 01:03:35.703
I'm warm now.

01:03:47.622 --> 01:03:50.420
Does the maid live here
or just come for your breakfast?

01:04:15.483 --> 01:04:20.477
There'd be a lots for a maid
to do, looking after Mr. Stahr.

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:37.631
Are you going to stay
in California?

01:04:41.276 --> 01:04:42.368
Are you?

01:04:47.048 --> 01:04:48.106
Huh?

01:04:51.987 --> 01:04:53.511
Can't you tell me?

01:04:57.158 --> 01:04:59.786
What's the mystey?

01:04:59.828 --> 01:05:00.817
Not now.

01:05:00.862 --> 01:05:02.955
It's not worth telling.

01:05:06.534 --> 01:05:07.660
Come here then.

01:05:07.702 --> 01:05:08.726
You're tired.

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:09.737
No, I'm not.

01:05:09.771 --> 01:05:11.830
I mean, you work too hard.

01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:13.363
Don't be a mother.

01:05:13.408 --> 01:05:16.241
What shall I be?

01:05:16.278 --> 01:05:17.939
I'll show you.

01:05:23.652 --> 01:05:25.051
You've taken off my apron.

01:05:31.459 --> 01:05:35.759
It's here I look
like Minna Davis...

01:05:35.797 --> 01:05:36.821
isn't it?

01:05:39.434 --> 01:05:40.594
No.

01:05:46.474 --> 01:05:47.907
It's here.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.846
What was he like?

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:59.548
He was a vey learned man.

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:03.922
He could have taught
all sorts of subjects.

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:07.087
He taught me.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:09.427
We traveled.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.697
He was vey attractive.

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:18.935
And he was also...

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:21.238
well, he was a king.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:23.609
I mean, he really
was a real one,

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.206
but he was out of a job.

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:29.115
That's what he used to say.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:37.191
I went everywhere with him.

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:38.818
I belonged to him.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.728
We were too close.

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:49.203
We should probably have had
children to stand between us.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.200
He wasn't really
much like a king,

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:57.269
not nearly as much as you,

01:06:57.313 --> 01:07:00.180
but then none of them were.

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:06.546
Then he started to drink.

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:09.990
He tried to force me to sleep
with all his friends.

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:16.696
And l...

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.308
I want a quiet life.

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.702
I can't stop looking at you.

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.313
I don't want to lose you.

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.681
I want a quiet life.

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.696
Have you lost something?

01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:23.925
It might have fallen out.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.160
What?

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.167
An envelope.

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:27.567
Is it important?

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:29.366
No, it doesn't matter.

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.281
I'll call you?

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.514
I haven't got a phone.

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:52.959
What's your real address?

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:56.964
It's just Bel Air,
there's no number.

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:58.091
Bel Air.

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:11.206
Well, Mr. Stahr, good night.

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.215
"Mr. Stahr"?

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:19.679
Stahr.

01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:21.553
Is that better?

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.251
If you like.

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:54.685
This fell out of the car.

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:56.190
Oh, thank you.

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.625
Did any of these people want
to speak to me urgently?

01:09:58.661 --> 01:09:59.719
All of them.

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:00.751
Oh, yes?

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.299
Would you get me
a glass of water?

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:06.323
Yes, sir.

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.289
Thank you.

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:38.300
Yes, sir.

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:41.895
Make sure you wake me up
at 1 1 :30.

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:42.995
Yes, sir.

01:12:25.907 --> 01:12:29.070
"ln half an hour,
I will be seeing you.

01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:32.511
"When we say good-bye,
I will hand you this letter.

01:12:32.547 --> 01:12:35.243
"lt is to tell you that
I am to be married soon,

01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:39.276
"and that I won't be able
to see you after today.

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:41.152
"l should have told you
last night,

01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:42.986
"but it didn't seem
to concern you,

01:12:43.091 --> 01:12:46.254
"and it would seem silly to
spend this beautiful afternoon

01:12:46.294 --> 01:12:50.094
"telling you about it
and watching your interest fade.

01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:52.656
"Let it fade all at once, now.

01:12:54.402 --> 01:13:00.272
"l am vey flattered that anyone
who sees so many lovely women...

01:13:00.308 --> 01:13:02.139
"l can't finish the sentence,

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:05.908
"and I'll be late if I don't go
to meet you straight away.

01:13:05.947 --> 01:13:10.111
With all good wishes,
Kathleen Moore."

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:13.243
George!

01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:16.621
Come on!

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:17.625
Open up!

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.286
You're all mad!

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:23.291
I know that.

01:13:23.331 --> 01:13:24.628
But why don't you open up?

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.759
Because you're...
you're all mad.

01:13:26.801 --> 01:13:28.564
Let's get you out of there.

01:13:28.603 --> 01:13:31.197
We'll go and have a drink.

01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:33.469
I don't drink in
the middle of the day.

01:13:33.508 --> 01:13:34.475
Hello, Mr. Stahr.

01:13:34.509 --> 01:13:35.498
Mr. Stahr.

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:40.473
Cheers.

01:13:46.454 --> 01:13:48.012
Hello, Mr. Boxley.

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.118
What's the trouble?

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:58.689
I am... dangerous...
when I'm drunk.

01:13:59.734 --> 01:14:01.565
Watch your step.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.195
I heard you were writing
a script.

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:05.138
Mmm.

01:14:05.173 --> 01:14:06.401
That's right.

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.576
Here it is.

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.582
And, uh...

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.212
here's the nickel.

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:22.549
It's...

01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:24.751
for the movies.

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:28.220
Get him home.

01:14:29.664 --> 01:14:31.097
Stahr!

01:14:31.132 --> 01:14:33.123
Stahr, I want
copyright protection

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:35.568
for the scene I just wrote

01:14:35.603 --> 01:14:38.436
about a drunken writer
and a producer!

01:14:39.607 --> 01:14:40.835
Stahr!

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:47.212
Oh, Mr. Stahr.

01:14:54.889 --> 01:14:55.981
Hello.

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.353
What's the matter?

01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:01.453
Nothing. Drunks.
How are you?

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:03.396
I have a terrible grudge.

01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:04.523
What's that?

01:15:04.566 --> 01:15:06.898
You forgot to dance
with me at the ball.

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.835
The ball.

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:10.565
Oh, God.

01:15:10.605 --> 01:15:13.335
One moment you were there and
the next moment you were gone

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:14.467
and you never came back.

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:15.601
I'm sory.

01:15:15.643 --> 01:15:18.806
I just... stepped out
for some air,

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:23.648
and then I met a man--
a man I hadn't seen for years.

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:27.678
Then we went for a drive.

01:15:27.722 --> 01:15:28.780
I hadn't realized

01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:31.314
how that part of Hollywood
had changed.

01:15:34.295 --> 01:15:36.957
You can see it vey clearly
at night.

01:15:40.368 --> 01:15:41.335
Mm.

01:15:41.369 --> 01:15:42.336
Then it was late,

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:43.632
you know,
so I went home to bed.

01:15:43.671 --> 01:15:47.539
So that part of Hollywood
has changed, has it?

01:15:47.575 --> 01:15:48.974
Yeah, unrecognizable.

01:15:50.578 --> 01:15:51.840
What about the man?

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.938
What about him?

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:56.709
Did he think that part
of Hollywood had changed?

01:15:56.751 --> 01:15:58.116
Yes, he thought so, too.

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:04.918
Well, that must have been
a real nice drive--

01:16:04.959 --> 01:16:09.020
both of you just driving around,
thinking the same thing.

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:11.725
Yeah.

01:16:14.602 --> 01:16:16.467
Listen, I want

01:16:16.504 --> 01:16:18.096
to ask you
a question.

01:16:18.139 --> 01:16:19.163
What is it?

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:21.368
Had the man changed?

01:16:21.409 --> 01:16:23.070
No.

01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:28.143
He was exactly the same.

01:16:30.318 --> 01:16:32.115
Old Gus.

01:16:38.426 --> 01:16:39.757
Cecilia.

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:52.301
Your father's in conference.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.171
Your father is in
a conference.

01:16:57.745 --> 01:16:59.144
Hi, honey.

01:17:02.183 --> 01:17:03.810
God, it's like
a steam room in here.

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:05.752
Why don't you open up
some windows?

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.311
I am.

01:17:07.355 --> 01:17:10.381
I don't know how you
can stand it.

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:11.551
Hey, are you all right?

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:12.617
Your shirt is soaked.

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:13.854
I'm fine, honey.

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:14.862
Just fine.

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:16.329
I'm just bothered,
that's all.

01:17:16.364 --> 01:17:17.524
What is it?

01:17:17.565 --> 01:17:19.055
Oh, it's Monroe Stahr,

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.159
that goddamn Vine Street Jesus.

01:17:21.202 --> 01:17:23.102
He's in my hair day and night.

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:24.400
Oh?

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:25.929
What are you talking about?

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.738
Oh, he sits there like
a goddamn priest or rabbi,

01:17:28.776 --> 01:17:29.936
telling me what
he's going to do,

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.639
what he's not going to do.

01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:32.907
He's got me half crazy.

01:17:32.947 --> 01:17:35.415
Look, um, why don't
you go on outside, honey.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.145
I got some thinking to do.

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:39.750
You're coming with me.

01:17:39.787 --> 01:17:41.550
You're going
to wash your face

01:17:41.589 --> 01:17:43.113
and put on a clean shirt

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:45.388
and come and do
your thinking outside.

01:17:45.426 --> 01:17:46.620
It's beautiful out.

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:50.929
Do you know how long
it's been since...

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.331
...we had lunch together?

01:17:58.673 --> 01:17:59.833
Have you been drinking?

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:06.913
Okay, honey,
I'll come with you.

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:09.109
You go on ahead
and get some air,

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:10.947
and I'll be with you
in a minute.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:22.328
You go out and get
some air, honey!

01:18:22.363 --> 01:18:24.661
I'll be with you
in just a minute!

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:57.459
Cover her up.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:51.085
Can I buy you a drink?

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:55.552
I don't usually, uh, drink
with the talent.

01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:59.254
I don't usually drink
with the boss.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.054
One before you go.

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.760
I'll get it.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.512
Bourbon.

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:24.914
One cube of ice.

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:34.191
You're quite a girl,
Lucienne.

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:37.687
Yes, eveybody likes Lucienne.

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:43.671
Here's to you, kid.

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:04.426
You have the choice,
brown sugar or white

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.621
You have the choice

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:13.966
My ghost by day,
my heart by night

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:17.335
Love's dear delay

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:20.501
Love's dread delight.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.081
It's too bad.

01:21:33.122 --> 01:21:34.851
I thought you
were coming away with me.

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:37.783
I can't.

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:41.286
You know I can't.

01:21:45.768 --> 01:21:47.360
I owe it to him.

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:51.506
I must go to him.

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:57.138
Don't you owe me something, too?

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.280
He's my husband.

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:07.453
You had the choice today

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:14.861
But you would never say,
no, you would never say

01:22:14.897 --> 01:22:19.266
You had the choice today.

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:33.912
I'll never forget you, kid.

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:41.579
Nor I you.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:42.681
Remember me to your husband.

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:43.884
Tell him he'll never know you

01:22:43.926 --> 01:22:45.484
the way I know you.

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:51.092
I lied.

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:53.693
I will forget you.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:56.704
I'll forget you by tonight.

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:21.496
Makeup and hair here?

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:22.861
-Yes, Mr. Stahr.
-Yes, Mr. Stahr.

01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:24.365
You made her look
like an angel.

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:25.764
I don't know how you've done it.

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:27.098
Congratulations.

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:29.160
-Thank you, Mr. Stahr.
-Thank you, Mr. Stahr.

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:36.543
Those, uh, French girls,

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:39.604
they really, uh,
they've really got depth.

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:41.878
They really know
what it's all about.

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:44.909
Yes, I think they have depth.

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:46.921
Who wrote that scene?

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.217
The English writer,
Monroe.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:50.725
Boxley.

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:53.626
It's the last thing he wrote
before... before he left.

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:55.289
What a great
going-away present.

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.389
Who ever heard anyone say,
"Nor I you."

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.627
Has anyone ever said,
"Nor I you," to you?

01:23:59.668 --> 01:24:00.965
"Nor I you."

01:24:01.003 --> 01:24:02.163
Hmm.

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:04.195
"Nor I you."

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.706
We'll have to rewrite the scene
and reshoot it.

01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:06.708
It's absolute crap.

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:07.936
People don't speak like that.

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:09.409
Do I have any writers
around here

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:11.639
who understand the
way people talk?

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.942
Norman.

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.141
Yes, Monroe.

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:15.513
Put four writers
on that scene tonight,

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.382
and I want to see the rewrites
before they shoot it.

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:19.284
Sure, Monroe.

01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:20.515
How much is it going to cost
to reshoot the scene?

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:22.524
Well, the set's
already been struck.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:24.389
So how much is it going to cost?

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:26.451
Oh, about $50,000.

01:24:26.495 --> 01:24:27.723
And we have a preview next week.

01:24:27.763 --> 01:24:28.855
I don't care what it costs.

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:29.886
Make it.

01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:37.468
I don't know what's wrong
with the scene.

01:24:38.974 --> 01:24:41.272
I thought that was
a pretty touching scene.

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.268
Do you know
a Miss Kathleen Moore?

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.603
What do you mean?

01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:14.336
A Miss Kathleen Moore
is on the line.

01:25:14.376 --> 01:25:15.866
She said you asked her to call.

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.156
Hello.

01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:00.310
Who is he?

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:02.880
He's an American.

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:04.653
He took me away.

01:26:04.693 --> 01:26:06.820
He brought me here.

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:09.262
I live in his house.

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:10.730
Where is he?

01:26:10.766 --> 01:26:13.291
He's away.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.098
He's an engineer.

01:26:15.137 --> 01:26:17.662
He'll be back...

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:20.038
next week.

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:24.108
We're getting married.

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:56.475
Are you in love with him?

01:26:56.512 --> 01:26:58.343
Oh, yes.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.816
It's all arranged.

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:03.681
He saved my life.

01:27:12.494 --> 01:27:15.725
I just wanted
to see you once more.

01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:23.103
It's all arranged.

01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:27.398
Stop walking.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.513
Come back.

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.990
Closer.

01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:03.175
Open your cape.

01:28:14.523 --> 01:28:16.081
Close your eyes.

01:29:38.173 --> 01:29:43.941
I can never get used to the way
night falls here so fast.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:49.940
There's no twilight, is there?

01:29:50.052 --> 01:29:53.078
Not really, no.

01:29:54.823 --> 01:29:56.381
It's so sudden.

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:11.168
I suppose some parts
of America are...

01:30:11.206 --> 01:30:12.298
gentle.

01:30:12.341 --> 01:30:15.674
Are you leaving California?

01:30:15.711 --> 01:30:17.144
We might.

01:30:17.179 --> 01:30:18.476
I might.

01:30:26.188 --> 01:30:28.383
Listen.

01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:36.320
What?

01:30:45.407 --> 01:30:46.601
Nothing.

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:07.119
Can you drop me here
at this corner?

01:31:14.736 --> 01:31:16.033
Good-bye.

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:29.951
Is Mr. Stahr...

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:31.418
She just flew in from New York.

01:31:31.453 --> 01:31:33.580
Well, Christ,
she's a vey important actress!

01:31:33.622 --> 01:31:35.613
I'm sory, there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:36.885
We have an appointment!

01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:38.722
I'm sory,
there's nothing I can...

01:31:51.273 --> 01:31:52.570
Mr. Robinson, please...

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.165
We've got to get this set
approved by 2:00.

01:31:54.209 --> 01:31:56.143
Otherwise,
we're way behind.

01:31:56.178 --> 01:31:57.145
I understand,

01:31:57.179 --> 01:31:58.578
but there's nothing
I can do for you today.

01:31:58.613 --> 01:31:59.602
Now, please go.

01:32:11.093 --> 01:32:13.220
You have to make arrangements
for the preview on Friday.

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:17.095
He's escorting me.

01:32:17.132 --> 01:32:19.100
I'll do it.

01:32:41.523 --> 01:32:44.617
We have to make arrangements
for the preview.

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:48.390
What time shall
I pick you up?

01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:51.888
Don't say you're not going...
because you must go.

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:55.730
You're the head
of the studio.

01:32:55.771 --> 01:32:57.500
You've no alternative.

01:32:59.708 --> 01:33:02.302
What time
shall I pick you up?

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:04.710
Any time.

01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:12.018
I'll be here at 7.:00.

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:27.726
Okay.

01:33:32.207 --> 01:33:34.232
They're waiting for you,
Mr. Rodriguez.

01:33:34.276 --> 01:33:35.971
They're waiting for you
on the mike.

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:37.169
Excuse me!

01:33:37.212 --> 01:33:38.406
Didi!

01:33:38.447 --> 01:33:40.881
Didi, this is Mr. Fleishacker.

01:33:40.916 --> 01:33:42.144
How do you do?

01:33:42.184 --> 01:33:43.583
Mrs. Fleishacker.

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:44.585
Yeah.

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.288
Excuse me.

01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:47.752
Here comes Didi.

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:49.051
Excuse me.

01:33:53.295 --> 01:33:54.557
Are you happy?

01:33:54.596 --> 01:33:55.688
It went vey well.

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.095
A really great performance.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:59.362
You really think so?

01:33:59.401 --> 01:34:00.129
Yes.

01:34:00.168 --> 01:34:00.930
No kidding,

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:01.936
you were terrific.

01:34:02.037 --> 01:34:03.732
Oh... thanks to you...

01:34:03.772 --> 01:34:04.864
to you all.

01:34:04.906 --> 01:34:07.636
And to you, for changing

01:34:07.676 --> 01:34:09.871
that fucking director.

01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:11.378
They're waiting for you,
Miss Didi.

01:34:11.413 --> 01:34:12.607
I'm coming.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.274
She really looks good!

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:28.652
Let's go to the beach.

01:34:28.697 --> 01:34:29.823
What about the party?

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:32.958
They're expecting you
at the party.

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:35.434
Drive me to the beach.

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:03.597
Do you think
you'll ever finish it,

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:06.464
so you can live in it?

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:10.497
I think you like it as it is.

01:35:11.573 --> 01:35:14.440
I think you like it
without a roof.

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:18.438
You think it needs a roof?

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.449
If you don't want one,
it doesn't need one.

01:35:21.483 --> 01:35:23.849
It's your house.

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:31.322
When are you going
back to college?

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.832
Any time.

01:35:47.442 --> 01:35:48.807
Yes?

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:51.038
Will you hold one moment,
please?

01:35:58.286 --> 01:36:00.413
Miss Kathleen Moore.

01:36:04.526 --> 01:36:06.494
Hello.

01:36:06.528 --> 01:36:07.927
I got your letter.

01:36:08.029 --> 01:36:09.724
Yes?

01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:11.459
Listen, I must see you.

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:13.694
It's vey difficult.

01:36:13.735 --> 01:36:15.930
It's essential. You know that.

01:36:16.004 --> 01:36:16.936
Look, we have the weekend.

01:36:17.005 --> 01:36:18.097
Come away for the weekend.

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:19.697
I can't.

01:36:19.741 --> 01:36:20.867
You must.

01:36:20.909 --> 01:36:22.934
We must have time to talk.

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:24.035
I'll tell you tomorrow.

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:26.945
No, you must say yes now.

01:36:27.015 --> 01:36:28.676
Say yes.

01:36:31.186 --> 01:36:32.278
Yes.

01:36:59.314 --> 01:37:01.043
I'll be going away
this afternoon for the weekend.

01:37:01.082 --> 01:37:02.606
Cancel all my appointments.

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:03.617
I'll be unreachable.

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:04.811
You're meeting
with Mr. Brimmer

01:37:04.853 --> 01:37:06.081
at Miss Brady's tonight
for drinks.

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.712
Cancel it--
I'll see him on Monday.

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:09.120
Fine.

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:10.852
This just came for you.

01:37:56.538 --> 01:37:57.562
Monroe?

01:38:00.108 --> 01:38:02.338
Keep going.

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:09.447
Sugar, Mr. Brimmer?

01:38:09.484 --> 01:38:11.315
No, thank you, Miss Brady.

01:38:13.421 --> 01:38:15.616
Sugar, Monroe?

01:38:15.657 --> 01:38:16.988
No, thank you.

01:38:19.961 --> 01:38:21.724
Who designed these rooms--

01:38:21.763 --> 01:38:23.128
your father?

01:38:23.164 --> 01:38:25.064
My father asked a designer

01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:27.226
to design it.

01:38:27.268 --> 01:38:29.293
Well, he designed them,
all right.

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:39.473
Thank you.

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.379
Thank you.

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:48.446
I thought it would be
a nice quiet place

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:51.151
for you two to meet.

01:38:51.192 --> 01:38:53.524
Oh, it is.

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:55.654
It's a vey
nice room.

01:39:20.488 --> 01:39:22.649
Know California well,
Mr. Brimmer?

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:26.091
No-- I spend most of
my time in New York.

01:39:26.127 --> 01:39:27.094
Busy?

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:29.187
Oh, yes.

01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:31.198
Your name's well-known here.

01:39:31.232 --> 01:39:34.633
And yours is well-known
in New York, Mr. Stahr.

01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:37.160
You have done well by water...

01:39:37.205 --> 01:39:39.867
and you by land.

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.841
What?

01:39:41.876 --> 01:39:43.207
Anthony and Cleopatra--

01:39:43.244 --> 01:39:44.370
didn't you recognize it?

01:39:44.412 --> 01:39:45.538
Shakespeare?

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.047
No, I didn't get any
Shakespeare at school.

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:49.675
How about you, Mr. Brimmer?

01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:53.252
Oh, a bit.

01:40:03.898 --> 01:40:05.331
Where do you come from?

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:09.132
Tennessee.

01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:10.330
Baptist.

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:12.134
I'm New York. Jewish.

01:40:13.074 --> 01:40:15.235
I know.

01:40:15.276 --> 01:40:17.107
Oh, at least
we're all Americans.

01:40:17.145 --> 01:40:20.080
We sure are, Mr. Stahr.

01:40:36.097 --> 01:40:37.894
Well...

01:40:37.932 --> 01:40:39.229
Well, I'm glad
you came out here.

01:40:39.267 --> 01:40:40.256
I wanted to talk to you.

01:40:40.301 --> 01:40:42.292
You've got my writers
all upset.

01:40:42.336 --> 01:40:44.429
Keeps them from going to sleep,

01:40:44.472 --> 01:40:45.666
doesn't it?

01:40:45.707 --> 01:40:47.470
I want them awake,
but I don't want them crazy.

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:48.743
Well...

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:50.801
...we're simply concerned

01:40:50.845 --> 01:40:52.369
that they have
the proper protection.

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:53.903
That's all.

01:40:53.948 --> 01:40:55.040
Who from, me?

01:40:56.951 --> 01:41:01.513
You're a vey good employer,
Mr. Stahr, but, uh...

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:04.786
we still think that the position
can be...

01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:06.452
rationalized.

01:41:06.494 --> 01:41:08.655
I'll tell you three things:

01:41:08.696 --> 01:41:10.527
all writers are children;

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:13.192
50%% are drunks;
and up till vey recently,

01:41:13.234 --> 01:41:15.327
writers in Hollywood
were gag men.

01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:16.734
Most of them still are gag men,

01:41:16.771 --> 01:41:19.205
but we call them writers.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.674
Uh-huh.

01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:25.645
But, uh... they're still
the farmers in this business.

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:28.546
They grow the grain,
but they're not in at the feast.

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:30.743
It looks to me like
a ty for power, Mr. Brimmer,

01:41:30.785 --> 01:41:31.979
and I will not give them power.

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:33.075
I'll give them money;

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.213
I won't give them power.

01:41:35.256 --> 01:41:37.349
Anyway, they're not equipped
for authority.

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:44.420
More coffee, Mr. Brimmer?

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:48.235
No, thank you.

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:50.100
Monroe?

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:51.331
No.

01:41:56.010 --> 01:41:58.137
I don't get to meet
Reds vey often.

01:41:58.179 --> 01:42:00.841
Are you a real Red?

01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:02.542
A real one.

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:03.777
Please do.

01:42:03.818 --> 01:42:06.651
Well, I guess some of you
believe in it.

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:08.348
Quite a few.

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:10.922
Not you.

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.255
Oh, yes.

01:42:12.293 --> 01:42:13.885
Oh, no.

01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:16.954
Oh, yes.

01:42:21.702 --> 01:42:22.726
Monroe!

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.700
Monroe!

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:37.347
All the stars
come here to eat.

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:38.510
Oh, really?

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:43.216
Is, uh... Greta Garbo here?

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:45.657
No.

01:42:45.693 --> 01:42:47.957
A pity.

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.724
Mr. Stahr...

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:50.821
Good evening, Mr. Stahr.

01:42:50.865 --> 01:42:51.957
May I have a picture, please?

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.796
Mr. Stahr...

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.165
please?

01:42:58.272 --> 01:43:00.433
Brimmer.

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.806
Want your photograph taken?

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:05.437
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer not.

01:43:06.714 --> 01:43:10.241
Wouldn't they have liked that
photograph back in New York?

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:11.251
Same again.

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:12.252
Yes, sir.

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:13.947
Two of us happy and smiling?

01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:17.380
Why, they'd have been
tickled pink.

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:18.857
Three of us happy and smiling.

01:43:18.893 --> 01:43:22.294
Oh, of course, with the
beautiful boss's daughter.

01:43:23.831 --> 01:43:24.855
Well, they'd have liked her.

01:43:24.899 --> 01:43:26.127
Did I say

01:43:26.166 --> 01:43:27.258
"the beautiful boss's daughter"?

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:29.292
I meant "the boss's
beautiful daughter."

01:43:30.738 --> 01:43:32.365
Isn't Mr. Brady your boss?

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:35.204
No, he's not my boss.

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:36.834
And he's not beautiful either.

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:39.277
What's not beautiful about him?

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:41.870
Same again.

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:44.514
Listen.

01:43:44.551 --> 01:43:45.518
I like writers.

01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:46.678
I understand writers.

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:49.014
Sure you do.

01:43:54.762 --> 01:43:56.127
I mean, l...

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:57.858
I don't think that...

01:43:57.898 --> 01:43:59.388
I have more brains
than a writer,

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:01.628
I just think that
his brains belong to me.

01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:03.830
I know how to use them.

01:44:03.871 --> 01:44:06.533
Well, you know yourself
vey well, Mr. Stahr.

01:44:10.945 --> 01:44:11.934
Here you are, sir.

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:12.968
Thank you.

01:44:18.052 --> 01:44:20.520
Now I know you've been
disappointed in love.

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:21.748
What?

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:23.381
That's your fourth scotch.

01:44:23.424 --> 01:44:24.584
Oh, come on,

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:26.559
don't be silly, I never drink.

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:28.754
I know you don't,

01:44:28.796 --> 01:44:29.854
but that's your fourth scotch.

01:44:32.232 --> 01:44:34.860
Well, I haven't tasted
any of them.

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:41.437
Well, this is the first drink
I had in a week.

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:42.442
Did my drinking

01:44:42.476 --> 01:44:43.443
in the navy.

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:44.535
You hear that?

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:46.136
This soapbox son of a bitch

01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:47.943
has been working on the navy.

01:44:51.919 --> 01:44:54.979
Well, uh...

01:44:55.089 --> 01:44:57.080
thanks for the dinner and
the meeting, but I must go.

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:58.648
I have to talk to some people.

01:44:58.692 --> 01:45:01.388
You mean, you have friends
out here?

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:02.452
Dessert, sir?

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:03.895
That's right.

01:45:03.931 --> 01:45:04.898
No, thank you.

01:45:04.932 --> 01:45:06.194
Oh, no, wait.

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:08.133
You've got time.

01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:10.159
We're going to go back
to your house.

01:45:10.204 --> 01:45:11.933
We're going to have
one game of Ping-Pong,

01:45:12.006 --> 01:45:14.236
one more drink...

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:17.903
and then I'm going to tell you
what I really think.

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:29.714
You play Ping-Pong well,
Mr. Stahr?

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:58.117
Is this Ping-Pong?

01:45:58.152 --> 01:45:59.642
He can't play.

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:06.559
Saturday is a...
a night to relax.

01:46:39.993 --> 01:46:41.756
Hey, you're pretty good.

01:46:41.795 --> 01:46:43.660
You're not so bad yourself.

01:46:57.744 --> 01:47:00.304
I'm going to beat up Brimmer.

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:02.975
I'm going to handle this thing
personally.

01:47:08.055 --> 01:47:09.920
Can't you pay
somebody to do it?

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:11.617
No, I do my own dirty work.

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:12.625
Mm-hmm.

01:47:12.659 --> 01:47:14.251
I'm going to beat
the hell out of you,

01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:16.922
and I'm going to put you
on a train, Mr. Brimmer.

01:47:16.964 --> 01:47:18.226
Now, stop this.

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:19.425
Now, stop it!

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:23.600
This man has
an influence on you.

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:29.671
He has an influence
on all you young people.

01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:32.076
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:33.170
Please, go home.

01:47:50.531 --> 01:47:53.329
I always wanted
to hit $10 million.

01:47:55.002 --> 01:47:58.199
Please... go home.

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:04.012
Can I do anything?

01:48:04.145 --> 01:48:05.043
No, really.

01:48:10.218 --> 01:48:13.710
Well, uh... thanks.

01:48:17.825 --> 01:48:19.986
Thanks for the game.

01:48:30.972 --> 01:48:32.269
What happened?

01:48:32.306 --> 01:48:34.069
He's gone.

01:48:37.345 --> 01:48:39.336
Did I hit him?

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:41.575
Oh, yes, quite badly.

01:49:56.757 --> 01:49:58.349
I didn't want to hurt him.

01:49:58.392 --> 01:50:02.590
I just... I just wanted
to chase him out, like...

01:50:02.630 --> 01:50:04.325
I didn't want to hurt him.

01:50:04.365 --> 01:50:06.390
I just wanted
to chase him out.

01:50:06.434 --> 01:50:09.562
I guess he got scared
and he hit me.

01:50:09.604 --> 01:50:11.196
Do you hold it against him?

01:50:11.239 --> 01:50:14.140
Oh, no, l... no, I'm drunk.

01:50:19.313 --> 01:50:20.905
I'm drunk.

01:50:24.452 --> 01:50:27.979
How would you like to go out
to Doug Fairbanks' ranch with me

01:50:28.055 --> 01:50:29.215
and spend the night?

01:50:29.257 --> 01:50:31.191
I know he would love
to have you.

01:50:53.381 --> 01:50:54.780
There you go.

01:52:27.642 --> 01:52:28.666
Sleep.

01:52:57.271 --> 01:52:58.898
Monroe.

01:53:02.076 --> 01:53:06.479
Monroe, I've called an emergency
meeting of the board at 1 2:00--

01:53:06.514 --> 01:53:08.243
my office at the studio.

01:53:09.817 --> 01:53:11.182
We'd be glad if you could come.

01:53:22.163 --> 01:53:23.425
Morning, darling.

01:53:27.935 --> 01:53:31.371
Your Monroe was in great form
last night.

01:53:31.405 --> 01:53:32.633
See you later.

01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:03.161
Ah, Monroe.

01:54:05.005 --> 01:54:06.063
Come in.

01:54:13.247 --> 01:54:14.646
Sit down.

01:54:20.688 --> 01:54:23.657
I've just been speaking
with New York.

01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:25.625
They've asked me to tell you

01:54:25.659 --> 01:54:27.684
that they no longer
consider you competent

01:54:27.728 --> 01:54:29.286
to negotiate with the writers.

01:54:30.564 --> 01:54:31.895
They've asked me
to be the spokesman

01:54:31.932 --> 01:54:34.628
of this board in all
further discussions.

01:54:34.668 --> 01:54:36.431
They don't consider that, uh,

01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:38.495
tying to beat up
the writers' representative

01:54:38.539 --> 01:54:39.938
is in the company's
best interest.

01:54:39.974 --> 01:54:44.138
I just want to say that this
board endorses these views.

01:54:44.178 --> 01:54:48.114
We also recommend that you
go away for a long rest.

01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:50.674
Take a break.

01:54:50.718 --> 01:54:53.186
Go to Tahiti or somewhere.

01:55:05.633 --> 01:55:07.999
This studio will fall
without me.

01:55:13.706 --> 01:55:15.196
Take a break, Monroe.

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:20.236
This is a waste of time.

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.145
I'll be talking to New York.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.950
They'll be glad
to speak with you,

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:31.354
anytime.

01:55:34.594 --> 01:55:35.754
Oh...

01:55:35.795 --> 01:55:39.196
and they said, "Be sure and see
a doctor about that eye."

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:42.498
Mr. Stahr.

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:45.663
We'll see the studio
doesn't fall.

01:56:19.105 --> 01:56:20.333
I'm sory.

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:21.601
I can't ask you in.

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:33.551
So how do you want the girl?

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:41.350
I want a quiet life.

01:56:45.965 --> 01:56:48.456
Any... pain?

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:58.075
Suppose you're in your office...

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:04.615
You've been fighting duels
all day, you're exhausted.

01:57:09.889 --> 01:57:11.652
This is you.

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.260
The girl comes in.

01:57:16.295 --> 01:57:19.287
She doesn't see you.

01:57:19.332 --> 01:57:22.597
She takes off her gloves,
opens her purse,

01:57:22.635 --> 01:57:24.694
dumps it out on the table.

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:29.040
You watch her.

01:57:29.075 --> 01:57:30.372
This is you.

01:57:36.382 --> 01:57:42.753
She has two dimes, a matchbox
and a nickel.

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:45.758
She leaves the nickel
on the table,

01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:49.125
puts the two dimes
back into her purse,

01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:53.531
takes the gloves to the stove,
opens it, puts them inside.

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:54.794
She lights a match.

01:57:54.834 --> 01:57:56.768
Suddenly, the telephone rings.

01:57:58.905 --> 01:58:00.998
She picks it up.

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.632
She listens.

01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:05.872
She says, "I've never owned
a pair of black gloves

01:58:05.912 --> 01:58:06.901
in my life."

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:10.244
Hangs up, kneels by the stove,
lights another match.

01:58:12.018 --> 01:58:15.419
Suddenly, you notice...

01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:20.521
there's another man in the room

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.323
watching evey move
the girl makes.

01:58:43.182 --> 01:58:44.740
What happens?

01:58:46.752 --> 01:58:48.982
I don't know.

01:58:57.997 --> 01:59:00.090
I was just making pictures.

01:59:16.849 --> 01:59:18.976
I don't want to lose you.

01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:02.157
I don't want to lose you.
