When I moved to Nashville,
I was 17 years old,

09:29.944 --> 09:33.990
and I started singing demos
for songwriters,

09:34.032 --> 09:37.494

all my beer money.

from that genre, too.

And what kind of music
do you want to make?

38:37.192 --> 38:40.653
I am classically trained,
but I decided to do this song

38:40.695 --> 38:42.197
because I'm trying
to steer more

38:42.238 --> 38:43.531
into the contemporary world.

38:43.573 --> 38:45.533
I love the song choice.

38:45.575 --> 38:47.911
I would be mindful of control
with your vocals

38:47.952 --> 38:50.455
so that placing your voice
on a technical note

38:50.497 --> 38:51.748
doesn't get yell-y,

38:51.790 --> 38:54.292
but I'm really excited
to see who you pick.

38:54.334 --> 38:57.879
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Yeah. Absolutely.

Being someone
that's trying to say something

39:00.340 --> 39:01.841
in the world
and connect to people

39:01.883 --> 39:04.552
is really
what we all dream to do.

39:04.594 --> 39:06.888
I've got to live that dream,
and I would love

39:06.930 --> 39:09.474
to try to find out
what your dream is

39:09.516 --> 39:11.893
and try to help you
mold that on this show.

39:11.935 --> 39:14.312

Who are some of your
favorite artists right now?

39:19.776 --> 39:23.405
My favorite female artist
right now is Lauren Daigle.

39:23.446 --> 39:25.615
She's just
a magnificent vocalist,

39:25.657 --> 39:28.827
and one of the things
I love about her is the richness

39:28.868 --> 39:30.745
and the raspiness
of her tone.

39:30.787 --> 39:32.580
The thing that attracted me
to you

39:32.622 --> 39:35.417
was that tone of yours
is really powerful,

39:35.458 --> 39:37.127
and it really cuts through,

39:37.168 --> 39:39.462
and I think it'd be
really cool for you

39:39.504 --> 39:41.756
to kind of let loose
a little bit.

39:41.798 --> 39:44.759
You've already been trained,
but now, how do you kind of

39:44.801 --> 39:48.054
unlearn some of the structure
that's been put around you?

39:48.096 --> 39:49.681
That's what I'd want
to work on with you

39:49.723 --> 39:51.016
if you were on my team.

39:51.057 --> 39:52.392
That was really good coaching,
you guys.

39:52.434 --> 39:54.686
Thank you.
Oh, my God.

39:54.728 --> 39:57.105
I met Lauren Daigle one time
in Nashville.

39:57.147 --> 40:01.234
All she could talk about was
how Gwen Stefani was her hero...

40:01.276 --> 40:02.986
[ Laughs ]
You liar.

40:03.028 --> 40:06.781
...and how Gwen's artistry
helped shape who she is.
Such a liar.

He's trying to get me to win.
Thank you. You're so sweet.

40:09.576 --> 40:11.786
What are you talking about?
She sa--
She didn't say that.

40:11.828 --> 40:14.497
She said that if she was
an artist on "The Voice,"

40:14.539 --> 40:18.126
she would choose you
as a coach, to me.
John: Oh, my God.

40:18.168 --> 40:19.169
She would lock in.

40:19.210 --> 40:21.963
And anybody
who wouldn't choose her,

40:22.005 --> 40:23.673
"I don't like them."
She said that to me.

"Whoa, that's weird."

40:57.207 --> 40:59.292
I thought her approach to it
was cool.

40:59.334 --> 41:01.002
I loved her tone,

41:01.044 --> 41:03.129
and when you find out
she's only 19 years old,

41:03.171 --> 41:04.714
it's kind of amazing
that she has

41:04.756 --> 41:07.300
so much power coming from
that voice.

41:07.342 --> 41:09.135
Nice jacket.
Look at that jacket.

41:09.177 --> 41:10.845
Lauren's not going to
like this, John.

and deception

Growing up in Miami,

You're surrounded by culture,

dance a lot, drink a lot.

41:58.768 --> 42:00.061
We have a lot of fun.

Cubans usually listen to
a lot of salsa,

42:03.231 --> 42:04.691
a lot of reggaeton.

42:04.733 --> 42:06.484
That's the typical Cuban music,

42:06.526 --> 42:08.611
but since
I was in middle school,

42:08.653 --> 42:10.572
I've had a love
for country music

42:10.613 --> 42:11.823
and it always
kind of spoke to me,

42:11.865 --> 42:14.534

the storytelling in it.

people love country music.

I was performing on stage,

42:25.086 --> 42:26.838

from the audience,

42:26.880 --> 42:28.465
"That's the Cuban cowboy!"

connect with her story.

an unpredictable choice today?

that very crowded country box

your hometown.

go with me.

Also, you could go
with someone

a country star

49:08.615 --> 49:10.784

number-one hits.

get a little bit yell-y.

What made you pick
that song?

I relate to it
because, uh,

1:07:39.476 --> 1:07:40.852
my mother was diagnosed
with what's called

1:07:40.894 --> 1:07:43.396

That's awesome.
That helps.

1:14:01.983 --> 1:14:03.902
What kind of music do you want
to make? What inspires you?

1:14:03.943 --> 1:14:06.488
I do a lot of comedy music
and I --
That's cool.

1:14:06.529 --> 1:14:07.822
Yeah, I cover a lot
of Tenacious D

1:14:07.864 --> 1:14:09.324
and Flight of the Conchords.

1:14:09.366 --> 1:14:10.867
How fun.
That's awesome.
That's really cool.

1:14:10.909 --> 1:14:12.660
Gwen: When I turned around
and saw you,

1:14:12.702 --> 1:14:15.705
you didn't look anything
like your voice sounded.

1:14:15.747 --> 1:14:16.998
Cool.
And then
you were so joyful,

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.084
it reminded me of that
whole Tenacious D thing,

1:14:19.125 --> 1:14:20.627
so it's working.

1:14:20.669 --> 1:14:22.504
It's great that you said "joy,"
because I don't just sing.

1:14:22.545 --> 1:14:24.506
I actually make
magic wands.
John:
Oh, my goodness.

1:14:24.547 --> 1:14:26.758
Gwen: Oh.
And I've made custom magic wands
for each one of you

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:29.302
because you spread joy
through doing this...
That's so cool.

1:14:29.344 --> 1:14:31.012
Oh, my God.
...and I just want to give you
all a little bit back.

1:14:31.054 --> 1:14:33.556
John:
How cool is that?
I love that. Oh, my gosh.

1:14:33.598 --> 1:14:34.849
Blake: What?

1:14:34.891 --> 1:14:36.267
Are they really magic?

1:14:36.309 --> 1:14:37.811
They have a little bit of joy
in each one.

1:14:37.852 --> 1:14:39.479
That is so cool
and so generous of you.

1:14:39.521 --> 1:14:42.232
If Blake would've turned for me,
he would've gotten this one.

1:14:42.273 --> 1:14:44.275
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll trade you.

1:14:44.317 --> 1:14:46.528
Okay,
I'll do a fair trade.
Okay.

1:14:46.569 --> 1:14:48.029
Is this a deal?
Is this a deal?

1:14:48.071 --> 1:14:49.239
I want my wand.
Deal.

1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:51.282
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:14:51.324 --> 1:14:55.286
This wand has the ability
to mute Camila.

1:14:55.328 --> 1:14:58.248
Mute. Mute.
[ Laughs ]

1:14:58.289 --> 1:14:59.708
My magic is too strong.

1:14:59.749 --> 1:15:01.376
Blake: And I'm hoping that
this one has the ability

1:15:01.418 --> 1:15:03.378
to make John disappear.

1:15:03.420 --> 1:15:04.963
Expelliarmus.

1:15:05.005 --> 1:15:08.174
John:
Thank you, J.J.
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:15:08.216 --> 1:15:10.051
Camila: I wrote my own spell.
Here it is.

1:15:10.093 --> 1:15:12.053
I don't want
no magic trick.

1:15:12.095 --> 1:15:14.055
Bring me someone
who is sick.

1:15:14.097 --> 1:15:16.057
Hi.
My name is Kate Kalvach.

1:15:16.099 --> 1:15:19.269
I'm 27 years old, and I'm from
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

1:15:19.310 --> 1:15:21.813
My parents,
they are over the moon

1:15:21.855 --> 1:15:23.398
that I'm going to be
on "The Voice."

1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:26.568
My mom, she's about
to lose her mind about it.

1:15:26.609 --> 1:15:28.236
[ Chuckling ]
She's so excited.

1:15:28.278 --> 1:15:30.238
She didn't even tell us
when she auditioned

1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:31.823
until she had found out
that she was

1:15:31.865 --> 1:15:33.324
going to get to be
on the blind auditions.

1:15:33.366 --> 1:15:35.910
Like, "How'd you keep this
from us?" [ Chuckles ]

1:15:37.287 --> 1:15:38.872
My parents are pastors.

1:15:38.913 --> 1:15:41.541
They both studied music
in college.

1:15:41.583 --> 1:15:45.128
We used to travel to different
churches and sing together.

1:15:45.170 --> 1:15:46.588
And music turned into something

1:15:46.629 --> 1:15:48.798
that I've been
so passionate about.

1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:51.384
My husband, Matt,
was definitely the first person

1:15:51.426 --> 1:15:54.054
to really push me
to sing outside of church.

1:15:54.095 --> 1:15:55.388
He's from the Czech Republic.

1:15:55.430 --> 1:15:58.892
We met in college,
and we're both musicians.

1:15:58.933 --> 1:16:01.144
Matt: Her voice,
it just touches your soul,

1:16:01.186 --> 1:16:04.147
and it makes you
fall in love with her.

1:16:04.189 --> 1:16:05.774
I feel like
I'm pretty objective,

1:16:05.815 --> 1:16:07.859
even though
she's my wife.
[ Chuckles ]

1:16:07.901 --> 1:16:10.612
Being with someone
from another culture is fun

1:16:10.653 --> 1:16:12.113
and interesting to navigate.

1:16:12.155 --> 1:16:14.866
A few phrases I've learned
in Czech are,

1:16:14.908 --> 1:16:17.577
<i>"Jak se más?,"</i>
which is basically "What's up?"

1:16:17.619 --> 1:16:21.664
They say <i>"Jo, jo, jo,"</i>
which means "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

1:16:21.706 --> 1:16:23.291
I'm still getting
the hang of it.

1:16:23.333 --> 1:16:24.709
[ Chuckles ]

1:16:25.919 --> 1:16:28.421
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Matt.

1:16:28.463 --> 1:16:29.464
He has pushed me.

1:16:29.506 --> 1:16:30.965
Good luck. Do it.

1:16:31.007 --> 1:16:33.301
It's been a dream of mine
to do "The Voice,"

1:16:33.343 --> 1:16:35.553
and I'm standing here
right now.

1:16:35.595 --> 1:16:39.391
I definitely want to prove that
I can push past my comfort zone

1:16:39.432 --> 1:16:41.476
of just singing in church.

1:16:41.518 --> 1:16:44.312
This is the biggest opportunity
I've ever had.

1:16:44.354 --> 1:16:47.190
It's definitely
very nerve-racking.

1:16:47.232 --> 1:16:49.734

Daly: Welcome back

Wake up.
You're losing.

1:17:03.206 --> 1:17:05.667
Slap me out of it.
[ Chuckling ]
"Wake up. You're losing."

1:17:05.709 --> 1:17:07.544
It's not time to relax.

1:17:07.585 --> 1:17:08.795
I'm coming on.

1:17:08.837 --> 1:17:10.296

Hello, there.
What's your name?

This is bad news --
bad news for me.
* They all could be

If you could've seen
the conversations
happening back here

1:19:22.387 --> 1:19:23.722
while you were singing,
it was like,

1:19:23.763 --> 1:19:25.223
"Oh, she's real good."

1:19:25.265 --> 1:19:27.976
It was me spearheading this,
being like,

1:19:28.018 --> 1:19:29.602
"She's really good.
Why aren't you turning?"

1:19:29.644 --> 1:19:31.438
And then by the time we got
to the end, it was like,

1:19:31.479 --> 1:19:33.398
"What are we doing?"
Well, actually --

1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:34.607
"What are we doing?"

1:19:34.649 --> 1:19:37.652
Oh! How did he do that?
Mine doesn't do that.

Is her mic on?

1:19:42.866 --> 1:19:44.159
You can't hear her?
I know because

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:46.161
my mute button really does work,
doesn't it?

1:19:46.202 --> 1:19:47.537
Why does yours
do that?

1:19:47.579 --> 1:19:49.039
It's part of my contract.

1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:51.416
I'm rewriting my contract
[microphone on] immediately.

1:19:51.458 --> 1:19:54.336
Yeah. Well, Kate,
by the end of your performance,

1:19:54.377 --> 1:19:56.171
you kept getting stronger
to the point

1:19:56.212 --> 1:19:58.423
where we all had to just say,
"That's it."

1:19:58.465 --> 1:20:02.802
Well, Kate, I was the first to
turn around by maybe .1 second.

1:20:02.844 --> 1:20:05.347
But I feel like
I really, like, encouraged you.
Was the first?

1:20:05.388 --> 1:20:07.474
I was like, "You know what?
If you like her, just go."

1:20:07.515 --> 1:20:09.559
Yeah, but that means that
the conversation started with me

1:20:09.601 --> 1:20:11.561
being like,
"I like her."
That's true.

1:20:11.603 --> 1:20:14.647

What kind of music
do you want to sing?
Pop. Yeah.

1:21:42.277 --> 1:21:44.487
'Cause Kacey Musgraves
is country-adjacent.

1:21:44.529 --> 1:21:45.947

with the muting.

most of that. I don't know --

So did everybody
in this room.

1:21:59.002 --> 1:22:00.420
That was so pretty.

I don't think we've had
anyone this season that can go

1:22:02.797 --> 1:22:06.676
in and out of their chest
and head voice that flawlessly,

1:22:06.718 --> 1:22:10.180
and I can really understand
the genre bouncing

1:22:10.221 --> 1:22:12.974
as far as, like, being
in a band, writing songs,

1:22:13.016 --> 1:22:14.392
and then going on
to do a pop record

1:22:14.434 --> 1:22:16.269
and then going on
to doing country music.

1:22:16.311 --> 1:22:18.563
And so I think it's one of
those things where we can blend

1:22:18.605 --> 1:22:21.649
all these styles together
and find your own style.

1:22:21.691 --> 1:22:23.234
So, I would love
to work with you.

1:22:23.276 --> 1:22:26.154
Thank you so much.
Welcome to Team Gwen!

1:22:26.196 --> 1:22:27.697
I think everyone's spoken,
haven't they?

1:22:27.739 --> 1:22:30.158
No, I still have
something.
Oh, okay.

1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:32.327
Wait a minute.
Let me just get something here.

1:22:32.369 --> 1:22:34.746
You can't pick Blake
because he might mute you.

1:22:34.788 --> 1:22:37.332
[ Laughter ]
Thank you.

1:22:37.374 --> 1:22:39.834
What in the world?
I'm scared.

1:22:39.876 --> 1:22:40.877
Come on, buddy.
[ Bleats ]

1:22:40.919 --> 1:22:42.003
Gwen: Oh, my God.

1:22:42.045 --> 1:22:44.089
[ Laughing ] What?

1:22:44.130 --> 1:22:47.217
This man is pulling out
all the stops.

1:22:47.258 --> 1:22:49.177
Come on.
Oh, my God.
It won't come.

1:22:49.219 --> 1:22:51.763
[ Laughter ]
[ Bleating ]

1:22:51.805 --> 1:22:53.723
Come on. Alright,
this ain't going to work.

1:22:53.765 --> 1:22:55.684
Goats are known
for being stubborn.

1:22:55.725 --> 1:22:58.103
Oh, that's not
going to work.
He tried.

1:22:58.144 --> 1:23:00.563
Anyway. Okay.

1:23:00.605 --> 1:23:02.190
Gwen: Good idea, Blake.
Good try. Good try.

1:23:02.232 --> 1:23:03.525
What Blake
is trying to tell you

1:23:03.566 --> 1:23:05.652
is that he's the G.O.A.T.
of "The Voice."

1:23:05.694 --> 1:23:08.363
[ Microphone on ]
Your team mascot doesn't
even wanna be here.

1:23:08.405 --> 1:23:10.115
[ Laughing ]
My team...

1:23:10.156 --> 1:23:11.700
Kate, who do you pick
as your coach?

1:23:11.741 --> 1:23:13.702
[ Laughter ]

1:23:13.743 --> 1:23:15.453
Let's go for it.
Come on, Kate.

1:23:15.495 --> 1:23:16.246
Ah!

1:23:16.287 --> 1:23:17.539
[ Audience shouting ]

1:23:17.580 --> 1:23:19.374
Blake was my first choice,

1:23:19.416 --> 1:23:21.042
but he didn't even
fight for me.

1:23:21.084 --> 1:23:23.712
Kate, I was bringing
a goat out here,

1:23:23.753 --> 1:23:26.464
and the damn thing won't go past
the hallway right there.

1:23:26.506 --> 1:23:30.260
Kate, you are my
Oklahoma City girl.

1:23:30.301 --> 1:23:32.595
I live in
Tishomingo, Oklahoma.

1:23:32.637 --> 1:23:35.265
There is an NBC affiliate
in Oklahoma City.

1:23:35.306 --> 1:23:37.475
KFOR -- Channel 4.
Yes.

1:23:37.517 --> 1:23:39.310
Imagine how excited
they'll be...
Yeah.

1:23:39.352 --> 1:23:42.147
...in our home state of Oklahoma
on Channel 4 right now

1:23:42.188 --> 1:23:44.733
if you choose me as your coach
and everybody gets behind you.

1:23:44.774 --> 1:23:48.319
We cannot separate
as fellow Okies.

1:23:48.361 --> 1:23:51.197
I don't know.
Come on, Kate!

1:23:51.239 --> 1:23:53.408
Come on! Please!

1:23:53.450 --> 1:23:56.536
It's so embarrassing if my
hometown girl doesn't pick me.

1:23:56.578 --> 1:23:57.620
Okay, I'm ready.
