WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:06.256
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.256 --> 00:09.092
MAN (on TV): ...so grab your rod
and reel, and join us next week

00:09.092 --> 00:13.596
when Jim takes us trolling
on Lake Winnebeshaki.

00:13.596 --> 00:16.015
Nice show, huh?

00:16.015 --> 00:18.518
Well, if you ask me,
there's something wrong

00:18.518 --> 00:20.520
with watching televised fishing.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.905
Not the same impact

00:21.905 --> 00:24.157
as watching it live, huh, Woody?

00:24.157 --> 00:25.492
Hey, you know something?

00:25.492 --> 00:26.493
I got a great idea.

00:26.493 --> 00:27.994
What's to stop us

00:27.994 --> 00:30.246
from taking a little
fishing trip ourselves?

00:30.246 --> 00:31.581
We don't want to?

00:31.581 --> 00:32.582
Oh.

00:32.582 --> 00:33.583
Come on, it'd be fun.

00:33.583 --> 00:34.451
You know, we could go

00:34.451 --> 00:35.835
this very afternoon,

00:35.835 --> 00:37.337
head out to Lake Winthrop, huh?

00:37.337 --> 00:39.205
What do you say? NORM: All right.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.124
Okay. All right, let's get
organized here, uh, Woody.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.625
Uh, I'd like you to be in charge

00:42.625 --> 00:43.626
of bait and tackle, okay?

00:43.626 --> 00:44.627
Got you.

00:44.627 --> 00:45.628
Cliffy in charge of, uh,

00:45.628 --> 00:46.629
food and the transportation.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.630
Okay.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.516
Well, what're you in
charge of, Mr. Peterson?

00:49.516 --> 00:50.800
Finding a reason not to go.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.553
Ah, here we go.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.855
Huh? Gladiator film
festival at the Majestic.

00:55.855 --> 00:56.856
CLIFF: Yeah, that's a good one.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.725
? Boom, boom, boom, boom ?

00:58.725 --> 00:59.976
(humming dramatic fanfare)

00:59.976 --> 01:02.979
De gustibus non est disputandum!

01:02.979 --> 01:05.865
(humming continues)

01:08.785 --> 01:12.622
(piano plays)

01:12.622 --> 01:15.075
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:15.075 --> 01:18.078
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.081
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:21.081 --> 01:24.084
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:24.084 --> 01:29.472
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:29.472 --> 01:32.258
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:32.258 --> 01:37.263
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:37.263 --> 01:42.268
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:42.268 --> 01:44.270
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:44.270 --> 01:47.273
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:47.273 --> 01:52.278
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:52.278 --> 01:55.281
? You want to go where people know ?

01:55.281 --> 01:57.283
? People are all the same ?

01:57.784 --> 02:02.288
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:21.858 --> 02:23.109
Hi, Sam.

02:23.109 --> 02:24.360
Hi.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.862
Oh, uh,

02:25.862 --> 02:26.863
some customer was in

02:26.863 --> 02:28.615
with some tickets to some concert,

02:28.615 --> 02:29.399
sounded foreign and dull.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.284
I thought you wouldn't want to miss it.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.652
Thank you.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.653
(gasps)

02:33.653 --> 02:36.039
Jean Pierre Rampal!

02:36.039 --> 02:37.657
It was just some customer. I
didn't really catch his name.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.076
Oh.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.961
He's a flautist.

02:41.961 --> 02:44.247
Nothing less than brilliant.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.634
No other player could so
eloquently fuse the world of

02:47.634 --> 02:50.970
classical music to that of modern jazz.

02:50.970 --> 02:54.340
What a perfect performer for us to see

02:54.340 --> 02:57.594
on this, our first
official date together

02:57.594 --> 03:00.096
in our new-found relationship.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.098
What should I wear?

03:02.098 --> 03:05.602
Something long or tea length?

03:05.602 --> 03:08.488
Why don't you wear something
you can stretch out in?

03:08.488 --> 03:09.355
Oh.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.858
The seat next to you's gonna be empty.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.276
Sam!

03:13.276 --> 03:14.277
Come on, please.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.663
Can't you scrape somebody
else up to go? Please.

03:16.663 --> 03:19.449
And the operative
word there is "scrape."

03:20.950 --> 03:23.953
There's only one man I want to be with.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.673
No, no, I'll go alone.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.174
And it'll be fine. Mm.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.626
Miss Chambers,

03:29.626 --> 03:31.878
I might be back from my fishing trip

03:31.878 --> 03:33.179
in time to take you,

03:33.179 --> 03:35.682
if I don't stop to clean up first.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.552
No, thank you, Woody, that's very sweet.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.553
Maybe next time.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.554
Okeydoke, but I don't know

03:41.554 --> 03:43.439
when I'm gonna be going fishing again.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.311
Cliffy, it was not ten.
I had 11 of 'em. 11!

03:48.311 --> 03:50.813
You're wrong, Normie,
you're wrong, wrong, wrong.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.699
How was the Gladiator film fest, fellas?

03:52.699 --> 03:53.566
CLIFF: Not now, Sammy.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.401
We're awash in controversy.

03:57.203 --> 03:58.655
You had ten, Norm,

03:58.655 --> 03:59.656
just like me.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.657
Ten what?

04:01.157 --> 04:02.659
Anachronisms. Huh?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.127
Oh, you know, those things that, uh,

04:04.127 --> 04:06.629
aren't in the time period
in which the film is set.

04:06.629 --> 04:08.631
Normie and I like to see
who-who gets the most.

04:08.631 --> 04:10.633
Today it was me. 11!

04:10.633 --> 04:12.635
Normie, you had ten just like me.

04:12.635 --> 04:13.636
There was no way

04:13.636 --> 04:15.638
it was Caesar Augustus wearing Reeboks.

04:18.558 --> 04:19.892
Hey, so you guys ready

04:19.892 --> 04:21.394
to go fishing? Uh...

04:21.394 --> 04:24.347
we got to... You know,
Woody, uh, couple beers first.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.350
You know, I work up a
powerful thirst watching,

04:27.350 --> 04:29.852
uh, Thoracian dogs smite
Spartan pigs, you know.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.856
Greetings, everyone.

04:33.856 --> 04:34.857
Hey, Frasier.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.109
How about a beer?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.411
Oh, well, no, Sam, just
make it a club soda.

04:38.411 --> 04:39.412
I've got to appear on TV today,

04:39.412 --> 04:41.281
and I want to keep my wits about me.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.782
Oh my! SAM: No kidding?

04:42.782 --> 04:44.083
What's the TV show?
FRASIER: Well, it's a

04:44.584 --> 04:46.085
local talk show called
Psychology This Week.

04:46.085 --> 04:47.086
Oh.

04:47.086 --> 04:48.588
Oh, maybe you heard it. I don't know.

04:49.088 --> 04:49.956
I know all about that show.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.841
It's where once a week a couple

04:51.841 --> 04:52.842
of shrinks get together

04:52.842 --> 04:54.344
and debate certain aspects

04:54.344 --> 04:55.845
of the psychological condition.

04:55.845 --> 04:56.963
That's right. NORM: Oh, man,

04:56.963 --> 04:59.299
we had to pick today to
go fishing, huh, Cliff?

05:00.683 --> 05:01.934
Well, I'm surprised.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.304
I didn't know you were a fan.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.221
SAM: Hmm...

05:05.221 --> 05:07.223
Well, he was, but he stopped watching

05:07.223 --> 05:09.609
when they lost the hostess
with the big Hindenburgs.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.396
It's on at 4:00.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.897
It promises to be very cerebral,

05:14.897 --> 05:17.784
and, uh, I might add,
uh, darned entertaining.

05:17.784 --> 05:18.951
Well, uh,

05:18.951 --> 05:21.237
unfortunately, Frasier, it interferes

05:21.237 --> 05:23.239
with another highly
cerebral event--

05:23.239 --> 05:25.241
the, uh, Raiders
- Patriots game.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.626
SAM: Yeah, right.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.077
I realize that football

05:28.077 --> 05:30.580
is a rarity on television in the fall,

05:30.580 --> 05:33.966
but don't you think we
could spare half an hour

05:33.966 --> 05:35.468
to see our friend, Frasier?

05:35.468 --> 05:37.920
Do you have any idea how
much action you can miss

05:37.920 --> 05:38.921
in a half an hour of football?

05:38.921 --> 05:40.890
About 18 seconds.

05:43.309 --> 05:45.011
Oh, all right, all right.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.263
I guess it won't hurt... much.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.765
Thank you, Sam.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.768
(phone ringing)

05:51.768 --> 05:54.270
Cheers. Yeah, hold on a second.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.154
Oh.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.073
You want to tell me what
the taxicab was doing,

05:57.073 --> 05:59.075
uh, parked in front of
the Temple of Athena?

05:59.075 --> 06:03.079
Yeah... all right,
uh, it was, uh... uh...

06:03.079 --> 06:07.950
it was, uh, probably taking
Demitrius to the airport.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.669
Well, thank you.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.003
(clearing throat)

06:11.003 --> 06:12.004
Well, as it turns out,

06:12.505 --> 06:15.007
you can now watch your game
with a clear conscience.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.510
I won't be doing that show after all.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.762
What changed your mind, Frasier?

06:19.762 --> 06:22.882
Well, Dr. Foster had
to cancel, and, uh...

06:22.882 --> 06:25.017
Dr. Sternin is going to take his place.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.054
Lilith Sternin?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.307
You mean that-- uh,
pardon my French--

06:31.307 --> 06:33.309
woman you once dated?

06:33.309 --> 06:37.313
That's a rather charitable
description, Cliff.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.198
Well, I just hope they can find someone

06:39.198 --> 06:41.451
to replace me as readily
as they did Dr. Foster.

06:41.451 --> 06:43.653
Can't handle debating a woman, eh?

06:43.653 --> 06:44.904
A woman, yes.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.406
An ice cube in heels, no!

06:48.291 --> 06:50.243
Look, I have no intention
of entering a debate

06:50.243 --> 06:53.746
with those cold, gray eyes and
those clever, smirking lips.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.249
I'd rather clip my nails in a Cuisinart.

06:59.302 --> 07:01.804
Oh, my.

07:01.804 --> 07:03.172
What's wrong?

07:03.172 --> 07:04.557
Oh, don't you see?

07:04.557 --> 07:05.925
Frasier's in love.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.176
He's what?

07:07.176 --> 07:08.678
Oh, come on, Sam.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.179
You're forgetting I was once

07:10.179 --> 07:12.682
romantically involved with Frasier.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.184
I know when he's enamored of someone.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.437
Didn't you see his nostrils flare?

07:19.105 --> 07:22.358
And everyone knows that hate
is not the opposite of love.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.743
Indifference is.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.194
Well, whatever you say.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.579
I really don't care.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.869
Touch?, Sam.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.754
Let's be honest.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.539
Quite often you've expressed

07:36.539 --> 07:38.541
feelings of antagonism toward me,

07:38.541 --> 07:40.543
and we both know how much you love me.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.961
I...

07:41.961 --> 07:43.463
I do not love you, Diane,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.715
and I have the nostrils to prove it.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.517
And you...

07:47.517 --> 07:48.885
You're wrong about Frasier.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.386
I mean, I know
psychobabble when I hear it,

07:50.386 --> 07:51.387
and I also...

07:51.387 --> 07:52.638
Wait. Uh...

07:52.638 --> 07:55.391
Frasier? There's a theory

07:55.391 --> 07:56.392
going around the bar

07:56.392 --> 07:58.644
that you're ticked off with Dr. Sternin

07:58.644 --> 07:59.979
because you're in love with her.

07:59.979 --> 08:00.980
What do you think?

08:00.980 --> 08:02.482
Well, that sounds like someone

08:02.482 --> 08:03.983
who doesn't know shortcake from Shinola.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.985
Hey, good guess,
good guess-- Diane.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.370
FRASIER: Oh, well, hmm.

08:07.370 --> 08:09.655
That's nothing but mere
cocktail-party psychology.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.574
Believe it or not, Sam,
it's actually possible

08:11.574 --> 08:13.075
to have hostile feelings toward someone

08:13.075 --> 08:14.460
without being in love with them.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.795
You mean I can actually hate Diane

08:15.795 --> 08:18.297
without having it mean
anything more than I hate her?

08:18.297 --> 08:20.216
Feel free. Ooh!

08:20.216 --> 08:21.467
Oh, I better cancel

08:21.467 --> 08:23.803
that appearance before it's too late.

08:23.803 --> 08:24.804
Hang on. There you go.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.172
CLIFF: Uh-oh!

08:26.172 --> 08:28.007
Frost warning.

08:31.227 --> 08:33.563
Good afternoon, Dr. Crane.

08:36.566 --> 08:38.433
Dr. Sternin.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.436
What a lovely surprise.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.938
I hope I can regard that as civility

08:42.938 --> 08:44.941
in light of today's situation,

08:44.941 --> 08:46.943
rather than sarcasm at my expense.

08:46.943 --> 08:50.196
No, that was completely at your expense.

08:51.914 --> 08:54.250
You know, I wasn't
going to do today's show

08:54.250 --> 08:56.252
when I heard you were the other guest,

08:56.252 --> 08:57.753
but then I realized I'd relish

08:57.753 --> 09:00.122
proving my superiority
over you in public.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.542
Yes, that appeals to me, too.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.544
So, I felt we should at least discuss

09:04.544 --> 09:06.295
some procedures of conduct.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.630
Ah, well...

09:07.630 --> 09:09.131
Don't you dare.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.018
My mistake.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.387
So, am I to assume that
you just naturally thought

09:14.387 --> 09:16.138
that I'd be at this
drinking establishment?

09:16.138 --> 09:18.941
Actually, knowing your
obsessive-compulsiveness,

09:19.442 --> 09:20.943
I checked with your service,

09:20.943 --> 09:22.445
and indeed, you'd left them

09:22.445 --> 09:24.947
a very complete itinerary of your day.

09:24.947 --> 09:28.951
I trust all went well
at the dry cleaner's.

09:28.951 --> 09:30.953
Thank you, yes.

09:30.953 --> 09:33.456
And I can assume from your questioning

09:33.456 --> 09:35.958
that you're attempting
to make idle conversation

09:35.958 --> 09:38.461
rather than articulating
some control dysfunction

09:38.461 --> 09:39.462
with my personal habits.

09:39.462 --> 09:40.713
That's correct.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.999
Are they fighting?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.383
LILITH: First of all,

09:44.383 --> 09:47.336
I think any mention of
our past relationship

09:47.336 --> 09:50.840
could tarnish the objectivity
factor of the show.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.341
You call that a relationship?

09:52.341 --> 09:53.843
I mean, we dated one time.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.345
The closest we came to physical contact

09:56.345 --> 09:59.849
was when you closed
the car door on my hand.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.350
Are you repressing? Oh!

10:01.350 --> 10:03.235
Forgive me. Actually,
you're quite right.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.237
Yes, I should be
straightforward in telling you

10:05.237 --> 10:07.106
that you are passionless,
stoic and emotionally numb.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.575
Apology accepted. Merci.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.860
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

10:10.860 --> 10:11.861
they're fighting.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.863
He just asked for mercy.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.282
Secondly, I think perhaps we...

10:16.282 --> 10:17.783
Look, Dr. Sternin, if you'll excuse me,

10:17.783 --> 10:19.285
I have to cash a check and fill up

10:19.285 --> 10:20.286
my gas tank before the show.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.287
Yes, I know.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.173
Have the attendant make sure your tires

10:24.173 --> 10:26.592
aren't as inflated as your ego.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.846
You know, you perplex me.

10:30.846 --> 10:32.515
Oh?

10:32.515 --> 10:35.434
Yes, normally people of
your limited physical appeal

10:35.434 --> 10:37.303
make up for it with
an actual personality.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.895
Dr. Sternin, excuse me.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.898
I overheard Dr. Crane's remarks.

10:48.898 --> 10:49.899
If it's any consolation,

10:49.899 --> 10:51.901
I can empathize with your hurt feelings.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.904
If you'd like to share
any of them with me

10:54.904 --> 10:57.907
as a fellow woman, I
would consider it an honor.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.659
Who are you?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.460
(chuckles softly)

11:01.460 --> 11:02.962
Diane Chambers.

11:02.962 --> 11:05.965
I'm an old friend of
Dr. Crane's, a student,

11:05.965 --> 11:07.750
and until my imminent marriage,

11:07.750 --> 11:09.135
an employee here at Cheers.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.136
Please, let's sit down.

11:10.136 --> 11:14.140
Well, I suppose I am
just a little sensitive

11:14.140 --> 11:17.009
when it pertains to my appearance.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.763
Well, if I may be so bold
as to step into your arena,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.065
I believe that

11:23.065 --> 11:24.567
Frasier's hostility

11:24.567 --> 11:27.436
is masking a deep attraction to you.

11:27.436 --> 11:31.273
(subdued chuckling)

11:31.273 --> 11:33.275
Thank you, Diane.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.778
It's been a long time since
I've had such a good laugh.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.167
Why would Frasier Crane
be attracted to me?

11:41.167 --> 11:42.418
I'm not that kind of woman.

11:42.418 --> 11:44.420
But you can be.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.422
It just takes a little
softening of the edges.

11:46.922 --> 11:48.424
Perhaps loosen the bun a bit

11:48.424 --> 11:50.676
to relieve some of the
tension in your face.

11:50.676 --> 11:53.462
I'm afraid it's not as easy as all that.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.214
Oh, that's nonsense. Look...

11:55.214 --> 11:56.015
I'm not far from here.

11:56.015 --> 11:58.017
Why don't you come over to my place,

11:58.017 --> 11:59.385
and I'll show you what I mean?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.220
We'll just put a little
more makeup on, or...

12:01.220 --> 12:03.606
some.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.358
I really don't think I can do that.

12:06.358 --> 12:07.359
Oh, come on, Dr. Sternin.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.729
You're going to be on television today.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.647
A little refinement of your appearance

12:11.647 --> 12:13.649
might give you an edge in the debate.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.535
Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.370
Good, good! Let me get my things.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.622
Sam,

12:19.622 --> 12:21.207
may I have my purse, please? Oh,

12:21.207 --> 12:23.042
and I'm going to be taking my lunch hour

12:23.042 --> 12:24.043
a little early today.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.544
Thank you for showing up at all.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.547
You're welcome.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.049
Shall we go?

12:30.049 --> 12:31.417
You know, I've always

12:31.417 --> 12:32.668
envied women like you

12:32.668 --> 12:34.670
who could simply tumble
out of bed each morning

12:34.670 --> 12:35.921
looking blonde and perky.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.723
Oh, well, I must admit,

12:37.723 --> 12:40.593
in my case, there is a
little labor involved.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.844
A little labor?

12:41.844 --> 12:44.847
She's calls in Local 416.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.973
(TV plays) Yeah.

12:53.973 --> 12:54.974
Oh. Yeah?

12:54.974 --> 12:55.975
Come on, guys.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.476
CLIFF: Yeah, I think they...

12:57.476 --> 12:59.979
Okay, the tank's full,
and the gear's all loaded.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.480
I got everything you could possibly need

13:01.480 --> 13:02.865
for a fishing trip.

13:02.865 --> 13:03.732
Uh, Woody, look, uh, we're right

13:04.233 --> 13:05.234
in the middle of the game, huh?

13:05.234 --> 13:08.120
I got a battery-operated
portable TV in the car.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.072
We got a few beers to
finish here yet, buddy.

13:10.072 --> 13:13.325
I got a cooler full
icing down in the trunk.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.629
Yup, I think

13:16.629 --> 13:17.630
the kid's outlasted us, Norm.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.631
WOODY: Hot dog!

13:18.631 --> 13:20.633
Look out, trout! (laughs)

13:20.633 --> 13:23.419
Hey, if you guys don't
mind, I'll do the driving.

13:23.419 --> 13:25.004
All right, I got shotgun.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.339
Wouldn't it be more sporting
to use a fishing pole?

13:28.340 --> 13:30.342
Oh, this is gonna be great!

13:31.727 --> 13:33.596
ANNOUNCER: It's a
fumble. Davis picks it up

13:33.596 --> 13:35.097
for the Patriots, He's
got a clear field...

13:35.097 --> 13:36.599
Come on, come on, come on...

13:36.599 --> 13:38.100
(all shouting)

13:38.100 --> 13:39.602
(theme music plays) Aw, come on, Diane.

13:39.602 --> 13:41.103
It's a great game. What're you do...?

13:41.103 --> 13:44.356
Now let's all check our watches.

13:46.158 --> 13:50.913
Did we not promise to watch
Frasier's show at 4:00?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.198
All right, everybody see it?

13:52.198 --> 13:53.199
ALL: Yeah.

13:53.199 --> 13:54.200
(fans cheering on TV)

13:54.200 --> 13:55.201
(affirmative shouts)

13:55.201 --> 13:56.619
(indistinct voices)

13:57.119 --> 13:58.504
All right, fine!

13:58.504 --> 14:01.457
I'm not gonna play cat-and-mouse
with a silly remote control box.

14:01.457 --> 14:03.459
You know, all you people ever see

14:03.959 --> 14:05.961
of Frasier Crane is an ordinary Joe

14:06.462 --> 14:08.848
sitting at the bar
being one of the guys.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.966
You should see him in his métier.

14:10.966 --> 14:13.185
He's a brilliantly perceptive man.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.471
Does anybody have a
box that'll shut her up?

14:15.471 --> 14:18.224
No, but I'd be glad to do it manually.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.441
SAM: Oh!

14:19.441 --> 14:20.693
Come on, you guys. We made a promise.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.561
MAN: Aw, Sammy! Thank you, Sam.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.697
HOST: First I'd like to introduce

14:24.697 --> 14:26.148
Dr. Frasier Crane.

14:26.148 --> 14:27.650
Dr. Crane is an eminent psychiatrist

14:27.650 --> 14:28.651
here in the Boston area

14:29.151 --> 14:31.654
specializing in treatment of phobias.

14:31.654 --> 14:32.655
(applause)

14:32.655 --> 14:34.907
Joining Dr. Crane in this discussion

14:34.907 --> 14:36.408
is Dr. Lilith Sternin.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.911
Dr. Sternin is a member
of the psychiatric staff

14:38.911 --> 14:40.913
at Boston General Hospital.

14:40.913 --> 14:41.914
(applause)

14:41.914 --> 14:45.417
(crowd murmuring)

14:45.417 --> 14:46.919
Welcome, Dr. Sternin.

14:46.919 --> 14:47.920
Thank you. Dr. Crane.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.178
You really made her
look beautiful, Diane.

14:56.679 --> 14:59.682
Physician, heal thyself.

15:04.186 --> 15:07.022
HOST: You've made many
excellent points, Dr. Sternin.

15:07.022 --> 15:08.324
How do you respond to them,

15:08.324 --> 15:10.326
Dr. Crane?

15:10.326 --> 15:11.827
Dr. Crane?

15:11.827 --> 15:13.329
Oh, excu... What was the question?

15:13.829 --> 15:14.830
Oh, uh,

15:14.830 --> 15:15.831
yes, of course.

15:15.831 --> 15:16.832
Excuse me, uh...

15:16.832 --> 15:19.335
Yes, my method of...

15:19.335 --> 15:20.336
flooding, uh,

15:20.336 --> 15:22.671
seeks out the patient's,

15:22.671 --> 15:24.957
well, most sensitive and vulnerable spot

15:24.957 --> 15:28.961
in the defense system, and, uh...

15:30.462 --> 15:32.348
penetrates...

15:34.266 --> 15:37.219
probing deeper and deeper

15:37.219 --> 15:40.723
into the patient's psyche,

15:40.723 --> 15:43.108
thrusting over and over.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.529
And thereby uncovering the reality

15:48.030 --> 15:49.398
behind the irrational fear.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.870
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.872
Anything to add, Dr. Sternin?

15:56.872 --> 15:57.873
Yes.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.375
Uh...

15:59.375 --> 16:00.876
(clears throat): Although

16:00.876 --> 16:04.380
Dr. Crane's method is faster...

16:05.381 --> 16:10.386
a slow and methodical approach
can be much more rewarding.

16:12.338 --> 16:15.341
Gentle stroking of the psyche

16:15.341 --> 16:17.760
will bring about a far more

16:17.760 --> 16:20.763
intense release of emotion

16:20.763 --> 16:26.151
building until the patient
quite often will literally

16:26.151 --> 16:28.904
cry out in a release of

16:28.904 --> 16:31.407
satisfaction and joy.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.277
(gasping): Point well taken.

16:37.196 --> 16:40.199
This intellectual stuff's
getting me all hot.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.203
This is embarrassing.

16:44.203 --> 16:45.204
We shouldn't be watching this.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.705
Mm.

16:46.705 --> 16:49.091
Well, maybe just a little while... Yeah.

16:51.293 --> 16:54.129
...and that concludes
this afternoon's program.

16:54.129 --> 16:55.514
Aw! Oh, no, no, hey.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.515
Boo! Come on!

16:56.515 --> 16:57.883
HOST: Dr. Sternin,

16:57.883 --> 17:01.186
Dr. Crane, thank you for joining us.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.188
Oh, excuse me.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.191
For a written transcript
of this afternoon's show,

17:06.692 --> 17:08.694
please send a self-addressed,
stamped envelope

17:08.694 --> 17:13.198
to Psychology This Week, Box 84037,

17:13.198 --> 17:15.701
Boston, Massachusetts,

17:15.701 --> 17:18.203
0220...

17:18.203 --> 17:20.071
5.

17:20.071 --> 17:21.457
What was that box number again?

17:21.457 --> 17:23.459
Uh, 02205.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.051
Hey, fellas, how was the fishing trip?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.053
Geez. It would have been a little better

17:34.053 --> 17:35.054
without Cliff's jabbering.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.057
Guy catches one fish,
turns into Ernest Hemingway.

17:41.510 --> 17:43.979
Oh, congratulations, Cliff.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.481
Thank you, Sammy.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.484
Yeah, it was man against fish.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.353
The rest of the world was shut out.

17:52.404 --> 17:56.108
It was a good fish, a clean fish,

17:56.108 --> 17:57.910
a strong fish.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.996
A little fish.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.034
Get that stinking,
slimy thing out of here.

18:06.034 --> 18:08.537
And take your fish with you.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.343
Oh, Frasier, I didn't expect

18:14.343 --> 18:15.844
to see you here.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.347
Thought you'd be exchanging
psychological positions

18:18.347 --> 18:19.715
with Dr. Sternin.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.186
Please, Sam.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.055
I made a complete fool of
myself today and Dr. Sternin.

18:27.055 --> 18:28.524
If they'd had a hose at the studio,

18:28.524 --> 18:31.393
they would have turned it on us.

18:31.393 --> 18:33.695
Actually, that sounds kind of fun.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.950
I'll never be able to
look her in the eye again.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.451
The only consolation is

18:39.451 --> 18:41.820
that nobody ever watches that show.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.989
Way to go, sex machine!

18:45.791 --> 18:47.793
I'm ruined.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.211
Half of New England saw me today

18:49.211 --> 18:51.713
as a rutting pig.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.631
Come on, Frasier.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.383
You're not in rut, you're in love.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.667
Oh, nonsense!

18:55.667 --> 18:57.669
I don't think that because
two people breathe heavily

18:57.669 --> 18:59.171
on a TV show is any cause for them

18:59.171 --> 19:00.672
to declare their undying love.

19:00.672 --> 19:02.141
Breathe heavily?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.892
I thought you were gonna
suck in a chair there.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.596
Listen, a TV station

19:07.596 --> 19:09.515
may not have been the
best place in the world

19:10.015 --> 19:11.400
to sprout antlers, but it happened.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.101
Go with it.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.158
DIANE: Dr. Sternin, you're...

19:19.158 --> 19:21.777
back.

19:21.777 --> 19:25.614
Diane, I'd like to thank you
for your Pygmalion-like efforts.

19:25.614 --> 19:28.617
I'd like to, but I can't,
because they led to disaster.

19:30.118 --> 19:32.004
Good evening, Dr. Crane.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.789
Dr. Sternin.

19:33.789 --> 19:36.291
It's, uh, nice to see you again.

19:36.291 --> 19:36.792
And you.

19:38.293 --> 19:41.296
I apologize for my overzealous
behavior this afternoon.

19:41.296 --> 19:42.798
And for making fools of us both.

19:42.798 --> 19:44.299
Yes, well, I would also like

19:44.800 --> 19:45.801
to apologize for my completely

19:46.301 --> 19:47.302
unprofessional attitude, and

19:47.302 --> 19:48.303
I promise you that

19:48.303 --> 19:50.305
that sort of thing
will never happen again.

19:50.305 --> 19:51.306
Fine.

19:51.306 --> 19:52.808
I've already penned a letter

19:52.808 --> 19:54.810
to the American Psychiatric Association

19:54.810 --> 19:56.311
apologizing for my behavior.

19:56.311 --> 19:58.697
I would suggest that you do likewise.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.948
Of course, of course.

19:59.948 --> 20:00.949
And I think

20:00.949 --> 20:03.902
perhaps for the sake of our
professional reputations,

20:03.902 --> 20:06.405
it's best we put this matter behind us

20:06.405 --> 20:07.906
and go on with our lives.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.291
Oh.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.542
That is probably wise.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.544
You see, I've already
lost three patients

20:12.544 --> 20:14.413
as a result of today's fiasco.

20:14.413 --> 20:15.664
That's odd.

20:15.664 --> 20:17.049
I picked up three.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.970
While we're on the subject,
Dr. Crane, I suggest

20:21.970 --> 20:24.473
that your behavior indicates
an unacceptable level

20:24.473 --> 20:26.475
of sexual frustration.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.978
You strike me as a man who
needs professional help.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.980
Or perhaps a girlfriend.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.483
And you strike me as a woman

20:34.483 --> 20:36.485
who could use a good cuffing.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.487
Good day, Dr. Crane.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.988
Good day, Dr. Sternin.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.991
Uh, just a moment, Dr. Sternin.

20:42.991 --> 20:43.992
Um...

20:43.992 --> 20:47.746
Sam, isn't the refrigerator
door stuck again?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.031
I don't think so. Oh,

20:49.031 --> 20:50.415
I think it is.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.783
And we need a hairpin

20:51.783 --> 20:53.669
to open it up. Dr. Sternin,

20:53.669 --> 20:55.420
could we borrow a hairpin?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.422
I don't see how a hairpin will help.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.207
Strangely enough, it does.

20:59.207 --> 21:00.208
FRASIER: Oh, well,

21:00.208 --> 21:01.710
don't you see?

21:01.710 --> 21:02.711
What these

21:02.711 --> 21:06.214
two people who are
such geniuses at romance

21:06.214 --> 21:07.716
are trying to do

21:07.716 --> 21:10.218
is to get you to take your hair down,

21:10.218 --> 21:12.220
thinking that it will stimulate me

21:12.220 --> 21:14.222
like some sort of Pavlovian dog.

21:16.725 --> 21:18.727
So, why don't you just

21:18.727 --> 21:20.729
oblige them, get this
silliness over with

21:20.729 --> 21:22.230
so we can get on with our lives?

21:22.230 --> 21:24.232
(sighs)

21:27.736 --> 21:29.738
You mean like this?

21:29.738 --> 21:32.240
Precisely.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.210
You know what?

21:35.210 --> 21:36.712
What?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.080
I'm going to kiss you.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.498
I'm going to

21:39.498 --> 21:42.000
kiss you hard, and I'm
going to kiss you long.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.004
But make no mistake about it,

21:46.004 --> 21:47.506
I am going to kiss you.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.641
In fact, I'm going to kiss
you like you've never...

21:53.645 --> 21:55.147
(sighs)

21:55.147 --> 21:57.649
Yes, like that.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.650
Now listen, Lilith, I think

21:58.650 --> 22:00.652
you and I have just been
too articulate for words.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.654
We talk and we talk, and
what we really want to do

22:02.654 --> 22:04.156
is show how we feel.
I think, Dr. Crane...

22:04.156 --> 22:05.157
Look, I don't care what you think!

22:05.657 --> 22:06.658
We both want to be animals.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.026
Now I'm going back to my tastefully

22:08.026 --> 22:08.994
decorated townhouse

22:08.994 --> 22:10.495
and prove it.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.998
Well, I-I suggest you come with me.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.001
I think I see what you're trying

22:16.501 --> 22:18.503
to do, Dr. Crane, and I
just want you to know...

22:19.504 --> 22:20.872
it worked.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.674
Let's go.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.847
Isn't it exciting to see the blush

22:28.847 --> 22:30.349
of new-found love on their faces?

22:30.849 --> 22:31.850
Do you realize

22:31.850 --> 22:33.352
we've just seen the birth of

22:33.352 --> 22:36.104
a new ro... Don't you
have someplace to go?

22:37.939 --> 22:39.307
Oh, yes.

22:39.307 --> 22:41.777
The concert.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.029
By myself.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.116
I'll go.

22:48.116 --> 22:51.453
And sure, I'll be
alone, but I don't care.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.455
Because I'm in love.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.207
And no one who's

22:55.207 --> 22:57.959
truly in love can ever be alone.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.462
And I know my fellow loves me.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.464
He just doesn't know it yet.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.833
So I'll go to this concert,

23:04.833 --> 23:08.170
listen to the music, and
dream again of the day

23:08.170 --> 23:11.173
when he'll be sitting beside me,

23:11.173 --> 23:13.175
holding my hand,

23:13.175 --> 23:15.677
sharing the moment.

23:15.677 --> 23:16.928
That's my dream,

23:16.928 --> 23:19.231
and mine alone.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.098
And no one can...

23:20.098 --> 23:22.434
Get her out of here!

23:24.186 --> 23:26.021
I'll go.

23:26.021 --> 23:28.907
Only if you really want to.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.611
But this is not a date.

23:32.611 --> 23:33.862
The fact that we sit together

23:33.862 --> 23:35.614
has nothing to do with anything.

23:35.614 --> 23:36.915
We're gonna take separate cabs.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.917
I will not talk to you
during the intermission.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.918
I'm not gonna take you

23:40.419 --> 23:41.420
anywhere afterwards,

23:41.420 --> 23:43.422
and we will not mention
this ever again, okay?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.923
Fine.

23:44.923 --> 23:45.924
Okay.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.427
Is that love, or what?
