WEBVTT

00:03.049 --> 00:05.354
My wedding to Marwa
is quickly approaching,

00:05.387 --> 00:07.726
but treachery is afoot.
There are people

00:07.759 --> 00:10.765
that are against me
getting married and being happy.

00:10.798 --> 00:13.103
No one is against you
or you getting married.

00:13.136 --> 00:15.040
Don't be so naive,
my little friend.

00:15.073 --> 00:18.046
Conspiracy is abound!
Ask the djinn. He will tell you.

00:18.079 --> 00:20.552
Do you wish to know
if conspiracies abound?

00:20.585 --> 00:23.491
No! Stop trying to trick me
into using up all my wishes.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.394
You're just not
thinking straight, Master.

00:25.427 --> 00:27.198
-Maybe it's because
you haven't slept in a week?
-(groans)

00:27.231 --> 00:29.268
GUILLERMO: Nandor is
so hyper-focused on having

00:29.302 --> 00:31.306
the perfect wedding,
he doesn't even slumber anymore.

00:31.339 --> 00:34.245
He just lies awake all day,
thinking of more things

00:34.278 --> 00:36.382
to make the wedding
even more perfect.

00:36.416 --> 00:38.220
NANDOR: Ah.

00:38.253 --> 00:39.823
GUILLERMO:
More things. More.

00:39.856 --> 00:42.696
More, more, more. (laughs)

00:42.729 --> 00:44.499
Maybe you are the one
who is not thinking straight

00:44.533 --> 00:46.269
because you have not slept
in a week!

00:46.302 --> 00:48.708
(snoring)

00:48.741 --> 00:50.377
(gasps)

00:50.410 --> 00:52.515
Yeah, no. I'm awake, I'm awake.
I was just...

00:52.549 --> 00:54.252
I was just... Uh, my eyes
were just a little, just...

00:54.285 --> 00:55.722
What were we talking about?

00:55.755 --> 00:57.091
CREWMAN:
We were just talking
about how hard

00:57.124 --> 00:58.761
you're working on the wedding.

00:58.794 --> 01:02.201
Yeah, no, it's true. I haven't
slept in a week, but I guess

01:02.234 --> 01:04.205
that's what it's like to be
the best man to a vampire

01:04.238 --> 01:06.209
who is absolutely losing
his fucking mind

01:06.242 --> 01:09.248
because he wants to have
the perfect fucking wedding!

01:09.282 --> 01:10.752
Can I do that last part again?

01:10.785 --> 01:13.290
Just without
the cursing this time?

NANDOR: Twirl it.

01:50.932 --> 01:53.370
Mm, no.

01:53.403 --> 01:56.209
You know, I've always dreamed
of having a big wedding.

01:56.242 --> 01:57.579
Or at least since that time

01:57.612 --> 01:59.148
that we watched
The Wedding Planner

01:59.181 --> 02:00.685
on that rainy Sunday together.

02:00.718 --> 02:02.756
-That was nice.
-It was okay.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.358
-(knocking)
-MARWA: Knock, knock.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.296
-NANDOR: Come in, my love. Hi.
-GUILLERMO: Hey.

02:06.329 --> 02:08.634
I wanted to ask you
about the flower arrangements.

02:08.668 --> 02:11.707
Yes. Red and black roses.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.913
But I was really hoping
we could go for white and pink.

02:14.946 --> 02:18.788
That's... What about
the black and the red?

02:18.821 --> 02:20.625
No.

02:20.658 --> 02:23.798
I will have Guillermo look
into it straightaway for you.

02:23.831 --> 02:25.568
Thank you, my love.
Thank you, Guillermo.

02:25.601 --> 02:27.271
-Of course.
-Bye.

02:27.304 --> 02:28.841
-(door closes)
-You see?

02:28.874 --> 02:31.379
Even my own bride is trying
to sabotage this wedding

02:31.412 --> 02:32.716
with her insane demands!

02:32.749 --> 02:34.452
-Enough.
-But... what?

02:34.485 --> 02:36.255
(door opens)

02:36.289 --> 02:37.726
So you're just going to
abandon me in my darkest hour?

02:37.759 --> 02:39.696
No one's trying to sabotage
your wedding, okay?

02:39.730 --> 02:41.834
-Pull yourself together.
-You pull yourself together.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.436
And you do not snap at me.

02:43.470 --> 02:45.307
-I'll snap at you.
-You just did.

02:45.340 --> 02:46.844
Nandor, quick question.

02:46.877 --> 02:48.714
Did you invite Sean
and Charmaine to your wedding?

02:48.748 --> 02:51.820
Why would I do that? It is
an all-vampire wedding, Laszlo.

02:51.854 --> 02:54.258
But I think
he would be greatly offended

02:54.291 --> 02:56.262
-if you didn't invite him.
-Okay, fine.

02:56.295 --> 02:57.932
Guillermo, figure out a way
to make it work.

02:57.966 --> 02:59.970
-LASZLO: Good man.
-His request

03:00.003 --> 03:02.241
for a human plus-two
is all too transparent.

03:02.274 --> 03:04.813
Add another name to the list
of people that are against me

03:04.846 --> 03:06.517
-and my wedding.
-(groans softly)

03:06.550 --> 03:08.754
Oh, perhaps I should add
your name to the list, also?

03:08.788 --> 03:10.257
How much do you want
some of this stuff?

03:10.290 --> 03:11.325
'Cause you literally
have a genie...

03:11.359 --> 03:12.495
-A djinn.
-who can solve

03:12.529 --> 03:14.231
all these problems, but no.

03:14.265 --> 03:15.802
You don't want to use
any of your precious wishes.

03:15.835 --> 03:17.237
Well, P. S.: you're gonna have
to, because some of these

03:17.271 --> 03:18.774
things are
literally impossible.

03:18.808 --> 03:20.778
-Like what? Name one.
-Oh, one? Um, I don't know.

03:20.812 --> 03:24.285
You want a live dodo bird to
roast for the wraiths to eat.

03:24.318 --> 03:25.922
Oh, you would deny the servants
a hearty meal of their own?

03:25.955 --> 03:28.293
-Can't we just do turkey?
-No!

03:28.326 --> 03:30.765
It has be a dodo.
What's the problem here?

03:30.798 --> 03:32.736
They're very slow birds,
very easy to catch.

03:32.769 --> 03:34.539
-They're everywhere!
-Not anymore!

03:34.573 --> 03:37.344
-Since when?
-1681!

03:37.377 --> 03:40.484
-You'll figure it out.
-(gasps) I'll figure it out.

03:40.518 --> 03:42.354
-Oh. (yelling)
-(crashing, clattering)

03:42.387 --> 03:43.791
GUIDE:
The nightclub needs
cheaper drinks.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.563
No, we want the drinks
to be very expensive,

03:46.597 --> 03:48.734
so then we attract rich humans.

03:48.768 --> 03:51.239
Am I right?
They gorge themselves

03:51.272 --> 03:52.842
on sauces and creams,

03:52.876 --> 03:55.548
and get their muscles
massaged. Oh.

03:55.581 --> 03:57.418
Rich humans
are basically like veal--

03:57.451 --> 04:01.459
conceptually repulsive,
but so buttery on my tongue.

04:01.493 --> 04:03.731
(yelling, clattering continuing)

04:03.764 --> 04:05.233
Hello?

04:06.637 --> 04:08.006
Hello?

04:08.039 --> 04:09.810
What the fuck?

04:11.345 --> 04:13.383
Are you okay?

04:14.886 --> 04:16.456
I'm fine.

04:16.489 --> 04:18.460
-(Nadja clears throat)
-Mm, my goodness.

04:18.494 --> 04:21.365
Guillermo, did you kick
five holes in the wall

04:21.399 --> 04:24.472
-and then fuck a chicken?
-Hmm.

04:24.506 --> 04:27.377
-No.
-What happened to the lamp?

04:27.411 --> 04:29.048
You know what?

04:29.081 --> 04:31.553
I think this little feller
is having a tantrum.

04:31.587 --> 04:33.657
Is this true, Guillermo?
Is Nandor's wedding

04:33.691 --> 04:35.695
making you put your knickers
inside a twist?

04:35.728 --> 04:37.765
It's just too much
for you, isn't it?

04:37.799 --> 04:39.836
-Let him speak.
-I'm perfectly fine to...

04:39.870 --> 04:42.609
Say no more. We can help.

04:42.642 --> 04:44.513
-Okay.
-GUIDE: Let's see here,
let's see here.

04:44.546 --> 04:47.084
Oh, well, getting a dodo bird
is easy. That's no problem.

04:47.117 --> 04:49.589
-It is?
-Yes, I have
an antique dodo bird net

04:49.623 --> 04:51.425
in the Chamber of Curiosities.
You can borrow it.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.762
NADJA:
It is obviously

04:52.796 --> 04:54.633
not in my nature to want
to help Guillermo.

04:54.666 --> 04:57.304
Don't put your back out
being grateful. (sputters)

04:57.337 --> 04:59.341
But because he is the
nightclub's accountant, I really

04:59.375 --> 05:00.578
need him to not have a stroke.

05:00.611 --> 05:01.880
The Baron has not
gotten back to you

05:01.914 --> 05:03.984
about officiating
the wedding ceremony?

05:04.018 --> 05:06.757
-GUIDE: Hey.
-Yes.

05:06.790 --> 05:08.961
We will take care of The Baron
so then you can turn all

05:08.994 --> 05:10.631
of your attentions
to catching the dodo bird.

05:10.665 --> 05:12.000
Oh, wow. That feels

05:12.034 --> 05:13.469
really weird being so nice.
(gags) Ooh.

05:21.653 --> 05:22.922
-He is a good boy.
-(Sire chuffs)

05:22.956 --> 05:25.093
Would either of you like
to give him

05:25.126 --> 05:26.697
-a little scritchie?
-No, but...

05:26.730 --> 05:28.701
-(barks)
-Oh.
-Eeh.

05:28.734 --> 05:31.607
Of course, I am so flattered
that Nandor asked me

05:31.640 --> 05:33.476
to officiate his wedding

05:33.511 --> 05:35.380
-to the beautiful
and charming what's-her-name.
-Hmm.

05:35.413 --> 05:36.783
-Marwa.
-Gesundheit.

05:36.817 --> 05:38.654
But what you ask of me--

05:38.687 --> 05:41.660
-it is simply not possible.
-Baron,

05:41.693 --> 05:44.533
everyone who's anyone who's
a vampire is going be there.

05:44.566 --> 05:46.537
Yes, I am aware of that.

05:46.570 --> 05:49.074
I am sorry.

05:49.108 --> 05:53.082
But look at my wretched state.

05:53.116 --> 05:55.688
Oh, I could not bear
so many witnesses

05:55.721 --> 05:57.759
to this tattered vessel.

05:57.792 --> 06:01.465
Once they dined
on the lavish feast

06:01.500 --> 06:03.403
that was my visage,

06:03.436 --> 06:05.808
but now, well, I serve them

06:05.841 --> 06:10.518
only a charred
and flaking peasant's crust.

06:10.551 --> 06:12.421
-Oh. You look great.
-Yes,
-Oh.

06:12.454 --> 06:14.926
-NADJA: Never looked better.
-Oh, you are too kind.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.763
-GUIDE: We're being honest.
-NADJA: Yeah, it's the truth.

06:16.797 --> 06:19.569
But I am not
the dashing, radiant being

06:19.603 --> 06:21.439
that I once was.

06:21.472 --> 06:23.510
I think I might know
just what you need.

06:23.544 --> 06:25.180
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:25.213 --> 06:26.917
That he's still fuckable

06:26.950 --> 06:29.455
-even though
he looks like a burnt log?
-No.

06:29.488 --> 06:31.560
Obviously, he's fuckable.
I mean, come on.

06:31.593 --> 06:33.429
I am thinking that somebody

06:33.463 --> 06:36.402
needs a...

06:36.435 --> 06:39.542
-makeover. Makeover.
-Makeover.

-Okay, what about this one?
-DJINN: It's just kind of what

07:26.536 --> 07:28.172
you're wearing right now.

07:28.206 --> 07:30.745
Back in Al-Qolnidar, I would
just wear the severed penis

07:30.778 --> 07:34.184
of an enemy on a sling made
from his dismembered intestines.

07:34.218 --> 07:36.188
-This is a wedding tradition?
-No.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.026
For me, that was
a Tuesday night.

07:38.059 --> 07:39.996
(titters)

07:41.032 --> 07:43.904
Nothing?
Okay, whatever.

07:43.937 --> 07:46.142
-Nandor?
-Yes, my love?

07:46.175 --> 07:47.879
-I was just looking
through the guest list
-Mm-hmm.

07:47.912 --> 07:50.183
and I noticed that
my parents are not on here.

07:50.216 --> 07:53.189
They had a prior engagement
of being very dead.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.193
I just always thought
my parents would be there

07:55.226 --> 07:57.197
for my wedding day.

07:57.230 --> 07:59.936
Okay, fine.
I will see what I can do.

07:59.969 --> 08:02.040
Thank you.

08:02.074 --> 08:03.944
(sighs)
How many wishes do I have?

08:03.977 --> 08:06.215
-You know I can't tell you that.
-Eh.

08:06.248 --> 08:08.620
Okay, fine. I wish

08:08.654 --> 08:11.292
for you to bring Marwa's parents
back to life for the wedding.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.064
-And do you want them
to speak English?
-Sure. Why not?

08:14.098 --> 08:17.538
Do you want to bring them back
to life permanently, or-or...?

08:17.572 --> 08:20.176
Eh, just
for the weekend is fine.

08:20.210 --> 08:22.147
-It is done.
-MARWA: Baba-joon! Maman!

08:22.180 --> 08:23.751
-MARWA'S MOTHER: Oh, my dearest.
-MARWA'S FATHER: Where is that

08:23.784 --> 08:25.955
-idiot husband of yours?
-MARWA: Baba, please.

08:25.988 --> 08:27.759
On second thoughts,

08:27.792 --> 08:30.931
maybe an early departure
on Sunday after brunch.

08:32.602 --> 08:34.639
GUILLERMO:
Oh, and for
the chocolate fountain--

08:34.672 --> 08:36.843
it's possible
to just put stuff on that

08:36.877 --> 08:39.214
that's not necessarily
chocolate, right?

08:39.248 --> 08:41.720
-WOMAN: Like what?
-What? We want, uh, it...

08:41.753 --> 08:43.657
-I'm not sure yet, but it's...
-Yes, that's fine.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.628
Okay, it's fine?
Can I get a couple

08:45.661 --> 08:47.297
of those, uh, five-hour
energy capsules, please?

08:47.330 --> 08:49.569
Talking about the normal ones
or the kinds for your dick?

08:49.602 --> 08:51.707
Derek.
Sorry, one se-one second.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.646
-Derek, what are you doing here?
-I'm working.

08:54.679 --> 08:56.248
-Working? You're a vampire.
-Hush.

08:56.282 --> 08:59.321
And being a vampire doesn't
exactly pay the bills, so...

08:59.354 --> 09:01.593
-What bills?
-Clothes, coffin,

09:01.626 --> 09:03.731
storage facility for the coffin.
Which, by the way,

09:03.764 --> 09:04.999
I'm not allowed to sleep in,

09:05.033 --> 09:06.335
but whatever.
But, you know,

09:06.368 --> 09:07.939
it's not a bad gig.

09:07.972 --> 09:09.108
Why don't you just take money
from the peop...

09:11.312 --> 09:13.249
...from the victims
that you kill?

09:13.282 --> 09:15.286
Because I'm a vampire,
not a thief.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.357
All right, so that's $16.56.

09:17.391 --> 09:21.198
-18, 19, and 20.
What's going on, my man?
-Thanks.

09:21.232 --> 09:22.835
-I'm-I'm good. I just... Oh.
-(phone buzzes)

09:22.869 --> 09:24.138
It's the flower people.
I have to take... I have

09:24.171 --> 09:25.708
-to take this. Hello. Guillermo.
-Oh, okay.

09:25.741 --> 09:26.710
Great shooting
the shit with you, man.

09:26.743 --> 09:28.012
-Mm-hmm.
-Really good.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.716
In fact, good to talk to,
well, anyone.

09:29.749 --> 09:31.018
I'm sorry, can you give me
one se-one second?

09:31.051 --> 09:32.722
Really quick, one second.

09:32.755 --> 09:34.893
Derek?

09:34.926 --> 09:36.863
-Are you okay?
-Ye-Yeah.

09:36.897 --> 09:39.702
Yeah. No. Ish.

09:39.736 --> 09:41.038
You know, it's really lonely

09:41.071 --> 09:43.877
being a-a vampire.

09:43.911 --> 09:45.648
Say, do you want a key cut
or something?

09:45.681 --> 09:49.321
Do you want to go
to a vampire wedding?

09:49.354 --> 09:51.760
-I do.
-I'll send you the info?

09:51.793 --> 09:52.995
-Yeah. Text it to me.
-I'll text it to you.
I have to go,

09:53.029 --> 09:54.833
-though, okay? Okay.
-Okay. Cool.

09:54.866 --> 09:56.703
-Wait. You had my number
this whole ti... Mm.
-Hello?

09:56.736 --> 09:58.139
-Yeah. I have to go.
-Hmm. Okay, yeah.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.776
NANDOR:
I am not being

09:59.809 --> 10:01.112
greedy with my wishes.

10:01.145 --> 10:02.648
I simply do not have
that many left.

10:02.682 --> 10:04.652
-How many do you have left?
-Not many.

10:04.686 --> 10:06.656
-Ay...
-GUIDE: Well, poor Guillermo.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.025
He's about
to have a nervous breakdown

10:08.059 --> 10:09.863
with all this stuff
he has to get done.

10:09.896 --> 10:11.867
-Boo-fucking-hoo.
-NADJA: She's right.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.871
And it's a terrible thing
when you work with someone,

10:13.904 --> 10:15.674
and all you want
to do is please them,

10:15.708 --> 10:17.310
but they treat you like
a piece of human shit they wish

10:17.344 --> 10:19.649
they could just scrape off
the sole of their shoe.

10:19.682 --> 10:21.820
-What?
-Huh?

10:21.853 --> 10:24.224
Nandor, what is the point
in having a djinn

10:24.258 --> 10:25.728
if you're not going
to use the djinn?

10:25.761 --> 10:27.632
-Uh...
-GUIDE: With all due respect,

10:27.665 --> 10:29.334
you are being
a real bridezilla.

10:29.368 --> 10:31.673
-I don't know what that is.
-GUIDE: Oh, it's like

10:31.706 --> 10:33.877
a combination of a bride
and a Godzilla.

10:33.911 --> 10:35.648
What is a Godzilla?

10:35.681 --> 10:37.819
Okay, I think we're getting
a little bit off-topic.

10:37.852 --> 10:39.923
He's a giant lizard creature
that destroys cities.

10:39.956 --> 10:41.225
-Enough!
-Whoa!

10:41.258 --> 10:42.962
-Whoa! Fuck!
-(high-pitched tone)

10:42.995 --> 10:45.366
-You were saying?
-Nandor,

10:45.400 --> 10:47.070
if you want
these impossible things,

10:47.103 --> 10:48.807
then you're going
to have to use your wishes.

10:48.841 --> 10:52.080
Okay, fine! I wish
for Baron Afanas to be returned

10:52.113 --> 10:54.953
to his original, non-burnt-up,
non-just-a-torso form.

10:54.986 --> 10:57.123
-It is done.
-I wish for a live dodo bird

10:57.157 --> 10:58.359
that we will slaughter and roast

10:58.392 --> 10:59.829
and feed
to the Wraith waitstaff.

10:59.863 --> 11:01.700
-It is done.
-And while we're at it,

11:01.733 --> 11:03.937
I wish that Marwa would like
all the same things that I like.

11:03.971 --> 11:05.674
-NADJA: Ah.
-It is done.
-And I wish that...

11:05.708 --> 11:08.379
I'm sorry, but you've used up
all your wishes now.

11:08.412 --> 11:11.318
-What?
-Well, it's been, um...

11:11.352 --> 11:13.256
-Yes, yeah. Happy now?
-I just got everything

11:13.289 --> 11:15.393
-I wanted out of this, so...
Yeah, big smile.
-Hmm.

11:15.426 --> 11:17.397
Okay, I wish for you all
to get the fuck

11:17.430 --> 11:18.800
-out of my bedroom.
-DJINN: Okay, I can do that.
-(squawks)

11:24.311 --> 11:25.981
-ANNOUNCER: This season...
-Game face.

11:26.015 --> 11:27.384
...the boys are back
with even bigger flips.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.722
More demo, more laughs...

11:29.756 --> 11:30.724
(laughing)

11:30.758 --> 11:32.127
Remove those blindfolds.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.830
...and even more surprises
than before.

11:34.832 --> 11:36.068
Tuesdays at 9:00.

11:39.441 --> 11:40.711
NANDOR:
I am very glad that

11:40.744 --> 11:43.015
my wedding will now be perfect.

11:43.049 --> 11:44.351
I do feel a little sad
that I had

11:44.384 --> 11:46.723
to use up all my wishes
to make it so.

11:46.756 --> 11:49.428
Hmm. Looking back,

11:49.461 --> 11:51.365
-(yawning)
-...I probably should not

11:51.398 --> 11:54.104
have used up so many wishes
on such trivial things.

11:54.137 --> 11:57.110
I wish for the lid
of my coffin to be closed.

11:57.143 --> 11:58.914
Are you sure?
I can just go fetch Guillermo.

11:58.947 --> 12:01.051
With Guillermo,
it will be a whole thing.

12:01.085 --> 12:03.055
-(lid closes)
-NANDOR: Ah.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.761
Guillermo.

12:05.794 --> 12:08.399
The dodo did a doo-doo.

12:10.871 --> 12:14.044
BOTH:
Sean and Charmaine Rinaldi,

12:14.077 --> 12:16.448
you will not be freaked out

12:16.482 --> 12:19.121
that almost everyone
at this wedding

12:19.154 --> 12:21.458
is a vampire.

12:21.493 --> 12:23.396
And tomorrow morning,

12:23.429 --> 12:26.001

Yes, I can hear them. I can
hear their hushed whispers.

Hoping and praying
for a disaster that will

12:37.825 --> 12:39.428
prevent my nuptials
from being finalized.

12:39.461 --> 12:42.200
Will you listen to yourself?
'Cause maybe it's you

12:42.233 --> 12:44.404
who's actually not too sure
about this wedding.

12:44.438 --> 12:46.208
And maybe you're the one
trying to sabotage it

12:46.241 --> 12:48.179
by accusing everyone else
of being against it.

12:51.485 --> 12:54.458
Can you blame me
for being a little afraid?

12:55.460 --> 12:56.963
It's a big step for me.

12:56.997 --> 12:58.834
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.838
You're gonna be okay.

13:00.871 --> 13:02.207
I'm gonna be right here
by your side.

13:03.209 --> 13:05.514

I'll be right there.

13:05.547 --> 13:07.117
I never said I was scared.

13:07.150 --> 13:08.386
I said I was afraid.
There's a difference.

13:08.419 --> 13:10.390
-Okay.
-Hmm.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.862
-Well, if you get afraid,
I'll be there.
-Yes.

Thank you, Guillermo.

Dearly benighted,

14:25.908 --> 14:28.012
we gather here tonight

14:28.045 --> 14:32.287
to join these two
in unholy matrimony.

it is not just

I must ask if anyone here
can show just cause

may not be lawfully wed.

15:04.084 --> 15:05.086
-MARWA: Mama, please.
-Awkward.

15:05.119 --> 15:06.221
NANDOR:
I told you.

15:06.255 --> 15:08.225
-Didn't I tell you?
-Yes.

15:08.259 --> 15:11.365
A vampire marrying a woman
he was already married to,

15:11.398 --> 15:14.471
but then abandoned
to die alone, only

15:14.505 --> 15:16.475
to be brought back
to life by djinn magic?

15:16.509 --> 15:18.112
It's just not natural.

15:18.145 --> 15:20.584
Mother, this is what I want.

15:20.617 --> 15:22.521
But I can't just
not say anything.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.191
(sighs)
Well, you could try.

15:25.193 --> 15:26.328
So awkward.

15:27.363 --> 15:29.602
So... that happened.

15:29.635 --> 15:32.340
-Now, with no further ado...
-I, too, object.

15:32.373 --> 15:33.710
-The fuck?
-NADJA: I sort of feel like

15:33.743 --> 15:36.115
this is more about
Nandor wanting a wedding,

15:36.148 --> 15:38.452
and wear a big dress,
than actually wanting

15:38.486 --> 15:41.125
to be married to Marwa.
Facts are facts.

15:41.158 --> 15:43.395
-I'm gonna sit down.
I'm done. Proceed.
-NANDOR: Thank you for that.

15:43.429 --> 15:46.068

Well, anybody else?

15:46.101 --> 15:47.538
-Actually, yes, I thought
of something else.
-(people murmuring)

15:47.571 --> 15:48.974
Oh.

15:51.011 --> 15:52.413
I just want
to conclude by saying

15:52.447 --> 15:54.752
I think all marriage is a sham.
(laughs)

15:54.785 --> 15:56.756
Apart from my own marriage

15:56.789 --> 15:59.662
to my darling wife Nadja
over there.

15:59.695 --> 16:04.137
The very first time
I met Nandor the Relentless,

16:04.171 --> 16:06.408
-I fell deeply in love with him.
-Ooh!

16:06.441 --> 16:08.145
'Course, as I got
to know him better,

16:08.179 --> 16:10.283
that feeling faded.

16:10.316 --> 16:11.686
But the memory

16:11.719 --> 16:13.657
of that one-sided passion

16:13.690 --> 16:15.627
is still too much

16:15.661 --> 16:18.767
for me to give this marriage
my full endorsement. Thank you.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.771
Hello.
Um, my name is Derek.

16:20.804 --> 16:23.543
-Who invited this guy?
-I'm just a bit bummed

16:23.577 --> 16:25.446
these two can find love
and get married, but I can't

16:25.479 --> 16:29.589
find one chill bud
to have a bull sesh with?

16:29.622 --> 16:32.427
I only very recently
became aware

16:32.460 --> 16:34.164
that vampires are real.

16:34.197 --> 16:36.569
Which, by the way,
doesn't freak me out at all.

16:36.603 --> 16:38.038
-Mm.
-It got me to thinking.

16:38.072 --> 16:39.374
-Everlasting life.
-CHARMAINE: Aw.

16:39.407 --> 16:41.278
You know?
That's a long time.

16:41.311 --> 16:43.583
Long time
to be with another person.

16:43.617 --> 16:45.721
You like her right now, but...

16:45.754 --> 16:48.425
Marwa, I just want to say
that I think it's a little rude

16:48.459 --> 16:50.597
that you haven't
stopped by my house.

16:50.631 --> 16:53.435
You're new to the neighborhood.
You haven't bought any, like,

16:53.469 --> 16:55.206
cookies or anything.
That's what people do.

16:55.239 --> 16:56.743
Nope.
Sorry, we do not validate.

16:56.776 --> 16:59.080
Once again, for the last time,
please do not get in line

16:59.114 --> 17:00.283

17:00.316 --> 17:01.351
G-Get on with it.

17:01.385 --> 17:03.455

17:03.489 --> 17:05.594
-to see you all gathered here.
-Since when did The Sire
speak English?

17:05.627 --> 17:08.432
Oh, I taught him.
Flashcards, mostly.

17:08.465 --> 17:11.806
-Hmm.
-Time lays waste to all.

17:11.839 --> 17:15.714
And love turns to dust.

17:15.747 --> 17:18.419
Ruin is inevitable.

17:18.452 --> 17:22.695
And all else is prelude.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.203
SEAN:
He's got a point.

17:27.237 --> 17:28.640
NANDOR:
Thank you for that.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.378
GUILLERMO:
Next it's... The Guide again.

17:31.411 --> 17:32.748
I forgot to say earlier,

17:32.781 --> 17:35.520
I also fell deeply in love

17:35.554 --> 17:37.725
with Marwa when I first met her.

17:37.758 --> 17:40.463
Enough of this bullshit!
I've had enough!

17:40.497 --> 17:42.066
I know what you are doing.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.369
You're plotting against me.

17:43.402 --> 17:44.772
Fuck you.

17:44.805 --> 17:46.643
-And I agree with him.
-Thank you.

17:46.676 --> 17:48.747
I admit,

17:48.780 --> 17:51.485
I have had my doubts
about this marriage, as well.

17:51.519 --> 17:54.659
-(loud gasping)
-I almost called it off
more than once.

17:54.692 --> 17:58.332
-What?
-But then, yesterday,
a feeling came over me.

17:58.365 --> 18:01.204
And I realized
that if this is what

18:01.238 --> 18:02.775
-Nandor wants...
-NADJA: Oh.
-LASZLO: Oh, fuck.

18:02.808 --> 18:05.747
-then it is what I want, also.
-Oh.

18:05.781 --> 18:07.885
'Cause when it comes to Nandor,

18:07.918 --> 18:10.423
I like what he likes.

18:10.456 --> 18:13.095
(cheering, whooping)

18:19.441 --> 18:22.380
-♪ ♪
-(indistinct conversations)

18:27.591 --> 18:29.662
Marwa, I must ask,

18:29.695 --> 18:31.298
when did this moment
come over you

18:31.331 --> 18:32.868
where you realized that

18:32.901 --> 18:35.807
whatever I like, you like also?

18:35.841 --> 18:37.645
Yesterday evening.

18:38.613 --> 18:40.817
Was it early evening or late?

18:40.851 --> 18:42.186
Late evening.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.723
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

18:45.494 --> 18:47.665
Yes.

18:50.704 --> 18:53.175
I'd forgotten how handsome
a vampire the Baron is.

18:53.208 --> 18:55.580
Oh, yes,
he's absolutely delicious.

18:55.614 --> 18:57.718
I must confess
we had a little quickie

18:57.751 --> 18:59.454
in the cloakroom
after the ceremony.

18:59.487 --> 19:01.859
-As good as you remembered?
-Oh, so much better.

19:01.893 --> 19:03.730
Right. Well, then
don't mind if I do.

19:03.763 --> 19:05.867
-Oh, enjoy, my love.
Ooh. (laughs)
-I bloody will.

19:05.901 --> 19:07.705
I say there, Baron,

19:07.738 --> 19:11.345
fantastic to see you returned
to your former glory.

19:11.378 --> 19:15.721
I have been wanting to have
a private word with you, Laszlo.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.891
If you would be so good
as to meet me

19:17.925 --> 19:21.331
in the coatroom in five minutes.

19:21.365 --> 19:24.839
Oh, yes.
I think I can manage that.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.375
Ah. Oh.

19:26.408 --> 19:28.813
-MARWA: Baba, let's dance.
-So.

19:29.782 --> 19:31.351
So.

19:31.385 --> 19:33.489
I suppose later tonight

19:33.523 --> 19:36.361
is when you will
make her a vampire

19:36.395 --> 19:38.800
so that the two of you
can be together

19:38.833 --> 19:41.238
forever and ever

19:41.271 --> 19:44.411
and all eternity.

19:44.444 --> 19:45.914
We will see.

19:45.947 --> 19:47.518
Yes, just as I thought.

19:47.551 --> 19:48.920
SEAN:
So that was great.

19:48.953 --> 19:50.757
-Then other times, I hit, uh,
-Thank you.

19:50.791 --> 19:53.462
Dyker Beach-- which, yes,
it's a public course--

19:53.496 --> 19:57.370
but, oh, man, I mean, they
really take care of the greens.

19:57.403 --> 19:58.773
So you, uh, get out
to the links often?

19:58.807 --> 20:01.646
-(hissing)
-(laughs) I hear that.

20:01.679 --> 20:03.650
-Ah...
-(Guide giggling)

20:06.288 --> 20:08.425
-(singsongy): Guillermo.
-(gasps softly)

20:08.459 --> 20:09.962
-Marwa.
-Hi.

20:09.995 --> 20:11.364
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

20:11.398 --> 20:12.935
Congratulations.

20:12.968 --> 20:15.272
You have done such a wonderful
job tonight, Guillermo.

20:15.306 --> 20:17.276
Oh, no. (laughs)

20:17.310 --> 20:19.280
I don't know
what I would do without you.

20:19.314 --> 20:21.552
-Mmm.
-Oh. Thank you.

20:21.586 --> 20:23.656
-Oh.
-That's... Thank...

20:23.690 --> 20:25.894
Oh, well, that's a lot
of kissing. (chuckles)

20:25.927 --> 20:27.931
-Mmm.
-Thank you. Wow.

20:31.706 --> 20:33.543
-Hey, bro.
-Hey! Fu...

20:33.576 --> 20:35.714
I got you a little,
uh, wedding present.

20:35.747 --> 20:38.887
A brand-new djinn lamp.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.262
-What?
-It's a little small.

20:43.295 --> 20:47.403
This one only has three wishes,
so use them wisely, huh?

20:47.437 --> 20:48.706
Could I use one of the wishes

20:48.740 --> 20:50.443
to wish
for a thousand more wishes?

20:50.476 --> 20:53.583
-No.
-Eh. Thanks for nothing.
