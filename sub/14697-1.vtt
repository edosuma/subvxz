01:48.862 --> 01:49.976
The leader's Danny O'Neil.

01:50.181 --> 01:51.329
Do you know him?

01:51.460 --> 01:54.494
Oh, sure he's the best trumpet
player this college has ever had.

01:54.617 --> 01:55.492
Let's get closer.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.968
I thought you'd like the music.

02:24.590 --> 02:25.863
Great, wasn't it, Ellen?

02:29.426 --> 02:30.937
Hi, Stu.
Where've you been?

02:31.144 --> 02:31.940
Oh, I've been around.

02:32.063 --> 02:35.098
Funny I was just saying the other day
I ought to see more of old Stu.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.776
Well, er, we'd better go
and sit down or something Ellen.

02:38.977 --> 02:39.931
See you later.

02:40.056 --> 02:41.283
Your playing
was wonderful.

02:42.254 --> 02:43.004
Thanks.

02:44.412 --> 02:45.844
You don't think she
meant you, do you?

02:45.971 --> 02:47.289
You don't think
she meant you, do you?

02:49.048 --> 02:49.844
Wait a minute.

02:50.127 --> 02:52.514
You don't think she'd fall for that
station house music of yours?

02:52.805 --> 02:54.919
It's not so much
my music, it's my personality.

02:55.123 --> 02:55.759
I'll show you.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.276
Hello Stu.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.993
Oh, Mr. O'Neill,
won't you join us?

03:02.476 --> 03:04.352
Oh, thank you.
See you later son.

03:05.913 --> 03:08.983
Well Stu.
Do you want something?

03:09.950 --> 03:11.620
Me? Oh, no, no.

03:13.706 --> 03:16.093
I've been wanting
to meet you for some time Mr. O'Neil.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.817
That's wonderful!
You mean you like the band?

03:19.261 --> 03:21.898
Oh I didn't mean I wanted
to meet the band exactly,

03:22.179 --> 03:24.293
although I thought
they did back you up rather well.

03:25.096 --> 03:27.733
Thanks. Is there any special
number you'd like to hear?

03:28.054 --> 03:31.679
I would like to hear the
Call-Me-Up-and-Call-me-down blues.

03:32.450 --> 03:33.086
The what?

03:33.249 --> 03:35.681
The Call-Me-Up-
and-Call-Me-Down blues.

03:36.566 --> 03:39.999
I know what you mean.
I'm afraid I haven't got the number.

03:40.442 --> 03:43.477
Oh, I'm sure you'll be
able to get hold of it.

03:44.319 --> 03:46.672
Why don't you go back
to the bandstand and look for it?

03:46.957 --> 03:48.105
No hurry Stu.

03:48.555 --> 03:52.101
It's such a long time since we got
together. I want to make the most of it.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.188
It's heartwarming
that's what it is.

03:54.990 --> 03:57.024
Nothing like old college friends,
I always say.

03:58.426 --> 04:02.859
All for one
and all for one. Ha, Ha.

04:03.342 --> 04:08.412
Yes sir, I think I'd better
be getting back. So long Stu.

04:08.657 --> 04:09.453
So long.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.048
Alright let's play
number nine.

04:46.464 --> 04:47.736
Why can't you
go on a picnic?

04:47.902 --> 04:49.619
Mr. Dunn is inside,
Mr. Taylor.

04:49.781 --> 04:52.009
Mr. Dunn?
He wouldn't be any fun on a picnic.

04:52.178 --> 04:54.451
This is a collection agency.
Not an escort bureau.

04:54.616 --> 04:55.968
Now will you please
get of my desk?

04:56.135 --> 04:57.408
Is this fellow annoying you
Miss Miller?

04:57.774 --> 04:59.285
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:59.492 --> 05:02.765
I was just seeing Miss Miller here
about the encyclopaedias.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.044
I figure
I can take care of the details.

05:05.207 --> 05:07.196
As Miss Miller was kind enough
to serve me with the summons,

05:07.405 --> 05:08.519
I'll explain the details.

05:08.724 --> 05:09.678
What is there to explain?

05:09.803 --> 05:11.757
Seven years ago,
you bought a set of encyclopaedias

05:11.881 --> 05:12.869
for which you've never paid.

05:13.080 --> 05:13.955
But I didn't buy them.

05:14.119 --> 05:15.267
Please,
you're wasting my time.

05:15.438 --> 05:17.108
See,
you're wasting Miss Miller's time.

05:17.596 --> 05:21.346
As I was saying seven years ago,
I must have broken a mirror

05:21.512 --> 05:23.467
because that walked in
and became my roommate.

05:23.910 --> 05:25.786
I was only a simple
freshman at the time.

05:26.308 --> 05:28.025
What are you now?
A simple sophomore?

05:28.946 --> 05:30.423
Oh, Miss Miller
you're being a bit unkind.

05:30.584 --> 05:32.698
After all, we've worked hard
to stay in college this long.

05:33.102 --> 05:36.887
It's not easy for a couple of bright guys
like us to go on flunking year after year.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.294
What in the world
are you talking about?

05:39.496 --> 05:40.133
Well, it's like this.

05:40.495 --> 05:43.690
As long as we can stay in college,
the band makes us a comfortable living.

05:44.012 --> 05:45.364
That's right five,
six thousand dollars a year.

05:45.531 --> 05:47.247
That's more than
you can make on Wall Street.

05:47.529 --> 05:50.439
Besides, it's a nice life.
Cultural, relaxing, gay.

05:50.806 --> 05:52.124
Getting back
to the subject.

05:52.245 --> 05:56.200
This roommate whom I trusted ordered
a set of encyclopaedias in my name.

05:56.401 --> 05:57.355
That's gratitude.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.714
It was a birthday present.
You were crazy about them.

05:59.998 --> 06:01.669
I was crazy about them
till I got the bill.

06:02.276 --> 06:04.344
Miss Miller.

06:04.794 --> 06:05.623
What's this?

06:05.793 --> 06:08.180
Mr. O'Neill,
Mr. Taylor, Mr. Dunn.

06:08.870 --> 06:12.905
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes! Step right in.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.213
Now look Mr. Dunn.
Here's the situation:

06:20.380 --> 06:21.528
we're temporarily embarrassed.

06:21.659 --> 06:23.887
You see we're working
our way through college.

06:24.296 --> 06:27.047
You've been working your way
through college for the last seven years.

06:27.294 --> 06:28.248
Well, takes time.

06:28.413 --> 06:29.481
Specially when you're struggling.

06:29.652 --> 06:32.800
Boys you don't pull any wool over me.
You ain't broke, you ain't struggling.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.077
You mean you
doubt our word?

06:34.208 --> 06:36.083
You said it. I've got your number.
You're businessmen.

06:36.366 --> 06:38.275
Now pay up or go to jail.
That's final!

06:38.923 --> 06:39.673
Final, Eh?

06:39.882 --> 06:40.553
Final.

06:40.682 --> 06:41.557
Final!

06:42.640 --> 06:45.674
Well, maybe we ought to ask
for an extension, hit it.

06:46.556 --> 06:48.386
Ok. Dunnsy boy we do make money.

06:48.555 --> 06:50.191
We haven't got any
right now just give us one month.

06:50.513 --> 06:52.149
- Just one month's extension.
- OK Dunnsy.

06:52.271 --> 06:52.942
I won't listen.

06:53.231 --> 06:54.379
I'll be around in a -

06:54.509 --> 06:55.419
- What do you think we are?
- Fly-by-nights?

06:55.548 --> 06:56.980
My word is
good enough, isn't it?

06:57.107 --> 06:57.584
Everybody in town can-

06:57.786 --> 07:00.423
Have that money here tomorrow
or I'll see you in court.

07:07.098 --> 07:07.769
No!

07:07.897 --> 07:08.647
No.

07:10.415 --> 07:14.485
That's a sordid little fella, isn't he?
Sordid little place.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.405
Must be a sordid
life for such a lovely girl.

07:17.889 --> 07:19.206
Oh, there's nothing
so sordid about it.

07:19.847 --> 07:21.165
Except the people
we deal with.

07:21.725 --> 07:23.316
It's a pity we can't
take Miss Miller out of this.

07:23.524 --> 07:24.638
Yes.
How'd you like some fresh air?

07:25.042 --> 07:27.031
Sorry, I have work to do.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.465
She's very businesslike,
isn't she?

07:32.595 --> 07:33.152
Yes.

07:34.074 --> 07:35.347
I like that in a secretary.

07:36.512 --> 07:38.228
In fact, I'd like to have
a secretary like that.

07:41.388 --> 07:44.616
You know, there's an
awful lot of work running a band.

07:45.744 --> 07:47.892
Come to think of it,
we do need a secretary.

07:48.581 --> 07:49.729
But I don't need a job.

07:51.099 --> 07:52.326
So she doesn't
need a job.

07:58.133 --> 08:00.361
Whatever it is I won't do it.
Now, I want to tell you.

08:00.491 --> 08:00.842
Ssh!

08:04.567 --> 08:06.681
Now look Mr. Dunn
I want to do the right thing.

08:06.965 --> 08:08.794
We don't care anything about
the encyclopaedia company.

08:09.163 --> 08:10.117
No, we care
about you.

08:10.282 --> 08:14.271
Oh yeah - er, well maybe
I said a few hasty words, boys.

08:14.398 --> 08:16.626
Let bygones
be bygones, eh?

08:18.514 --> 08:21.106
Two dollars?
But the bill's a hundred and ten.

08:21.352 --> 08:22.784
That's for you
to fix things up.

08:22.911 --> 08:23.865
What are you
talking about?

08:24.349 --> 08:25.747
Are you asking me
to take a bribe?

08:26.467 --> 08:27.581
A two dollar bribe?

08:27.826 --> 08:30.543
Oh, come on, Dunn. We're all
men of the world, you know.

08:30.664 --> 08:32.095
We'll keep it under our hats.
Don't worry about it.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.013
Sure, you can depend on us.
She'll tell you.

08:34.140 --> 08:34.970
She? Who?

08:35.339 --> 08:36.374
Miss Miller.

08:36.498 --> 08:37.010
Miss Miller.

08:37.138 --> 08:40.047
Miss Miller!
Come in here please.

08:40.575 --> 08:43.166
Did you intimate to these men
that I could be bribed?

08:43.371 --> 08:45.327
She didn't say your could be bribed,
she said you could be fixed.

08:45.530 --> 08:47.406
Well Mr. Dunn,
I didn't say any such thing.

08:47.688 --> 08:48.598
Oh get her.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.159
Oh yes you did,
she didn't want us to tell you.

08:50.326 --> 08:52.235
Don't believe him
Mr. Dunn,

08:52.364 --> 08:54.001
I heard her myself.
Didn't you hear her?

08:56.201 --> 08:57.076
Wait a minute!

08:57.680 --> 08:59.634
I'll have you deadbeats
put in jail,

08:59.758 --> 09:01.633
and as for you Miss Miller
you're fired!

09:02.196 --> 09:02.832
Oh!

09:04.034 --> 09:06.500
Thanks a lot
old man.

09:08.510 --> 09:09.339
Thanks old boy.

09:10.108 --> 09:12.620
Miss Miller,
Miss Miller,

09:13.545 --> 09:14.500
wait a minute!

09:14.744 --> 09:16.654
Haven't you rover boys
caused enough trouble already?

09:16.822 --> 09:17.936
It was really
a kindly gesture.

09:18.101 --> 09:20.215
A very kindly gesture.
Now I haven't even a reference.

09:20.339 --> 09:21.169
But I don't demand
a reference.

09:21.338 --> 09:22.168
We know you
for what you are.

09:22.338 --> 09:22.769
Yes.

09:23.217 --> 09:24.569
You mean you
really want me to work for you?

09:24.735 --> 09:25.690
Sure,
Wouldn't you like it?

09:25.854 --> 09:26.491
What's your salary?

09:26.654 --> 09:27.085
Eighteen a week.

09:27.253 --> 09:28.002
He'll double it.

09:28.212 --> 09:29.530
Yeah - er - Yeah!

09:30.051 --> 09:30.641
Well.

09:31.330 --> 09:31.727
Hit it.

09:31.889 --> 09:33.639
Let me tell you,
here's the chance of a lifetime:

09:33.767 --> 09:35.802
wer'e going all the way to the
- You can't go wrong if...

09:37.364 --> 09:38.921
Alright I'll take it.

09:39.043 --> 09:39.554
Good.

09:39.682 --> 09:40.319
When do I start?

09:40.441 --> 09:41.237
Right now.

09:41.361 --> 09:42.349
Well now that I'm
working for you,

09:42.480 --> 09:43.355
I'll tell you something.

09:43.519 --> 09:45.553
Dunn can be bought
but his price isn't two dollars,

09:45.677 --> 09:46.472
It's ten!

09:46.636 --> 09:47.784
Here you want
to take care of the details

09:49.034 --> 09:49.704
Hey!

09:55.068 --> 09:56.261
Well, here we are.

09:56.667 --> 10:00.861
You can have half of that desk, a quarter
of that rack and just - go to work.

10:01.423 --> 10:02.979
There's only one detail
that you've omitted.

10:03.101 --> 10:03.976
What are my duties?

10:04.420 --> 10:06.693
- Oh, you type a little.
- Telephone a little.

10:07.058 --> 10:08.092
Keep the leader happy.

10:08.496 --> 10:09.814
Keep your eye
on the brass section.

10:10.095 --> 10:11.368
I thought you said
this was a job.

10:11.773 --> 10:13.683
Lining up good
engagements is no cinch.

10:14.331 --> 10:15.319
What's so difficult about it?

10:16.649 --> 10:18.558
Operator get me
The Riverdale Country Club.

10:18.887 --> 10:20.160
Oh no, we've already tried.

10:20.366 --> 10:21.843
Who's in charge there?

10:22.364 --> 10:23.193
Mr. Bent, isn't it?

10:23.563 --> 10:24.631
Bent real sourpuss.

10:25.002 --> 10:26.070
Hello Mr. Bent?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.317
This is Mr. O'Neill's
Secretary

10:28.878 --> 10:31.106
No Danny O'Neill,
the orchestra leader.

10:31.556 --> 10:33.863
I read in the paper that
you're planning a Halloween dance...

10:34.313 --> 10:35.984
Hob Harvey's
Cornell Clippers oh,

10:36.112 --> 10:37.589
but we entertain too

10:37.790 --> 10:38.302
Do we entertain?

10:38.470 --> 10:39.265
No but we can
dream up something.

10:39.429 --> 10:41.987
Oh but our entertainment's terrific.
That's our strongpoint.

10:42.306 --> 10:45.375
Mr. Benn until you've seen
the Perennials you haven't lived.

10:48.421 --> 10:51.376
It isn't
that I don't admire Emil Colman,

10:51.498 --> 10:53.407
but isn't his music...
shall we say rowdy?

10:53.856 --> 11:00.528
Now, Mr. O'Neill's salon ensemble
play everything gently but with a lilt.

11:00.730 --> 11:03.719
And all his boys
are from such nice families.

11:04.287 --> 11:06.321
Very well, we'll expect
them at seven-thirty.

11:06.884 --> 11:07.555
Thank you.

11:09.682 --> 11:12.830
Believe me, bud, my outfit are killers.
Just what you need for one-nighters.

11:13.518 --> 11:15.508
- Can they pack 'em in like Dorsey?
- Solid Jack!

11:16.036 --> 11:16.945
Murder!

11:18.274 --> 11:20.547
Furthermore, I could come
down the day before the dance

11:20.672 --> 11:21.945
and help you with
the decorations.

11:22.191 --> 11:23.702
That is, of course,
if you want me to.

11:25.148 --> 11:27.057
Wait a minute men,
we took a poll on the campus

11:27.226 --> 11:29.180
and almost everybody
voted for Artie Shaw's band.

11:29.544 --> 11:31.295
Artie Shaw?
Who's Artie Shaw?

13:01.443 --> 13:02.636
You were terrific, Chief.

13:02.761 --> 13:04.512
Yeah, yeah -
glass of water please.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.629
What about that prom,
is it set?

13:06.798 --> 13:07.513
Not exactly, chief.

13:07.717 --> 13:10.070
- They hired that college band.
- Danny O'Neill's Perennials.

13:10.395 --> 13:11.270
O'Neill again, Huh?

13:11.474 --> 13:14.144
This is the fourth time
we've run into them on college dates.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.659
Either they've got a
great band or a fine manager.

13:18.347 --> 13:20.257
I gotta go up
and hear them sometime.

13:20.386 --> 13:21.295
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about them.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.856
They'll be graduating
in another week.

13:22.983 --> 13:24.461
Hmm!
Not The Perennials.

13:27.579 --> 13:31.125
OK, boys. No graduation this year.
I flunked three courses.

13:35.507 --> 13:37.303
Alright, boys,
break it up break it up.

13:38.065 --> 13:39.292
Oh, Danny you're wonderful.

13:39.743 --> 13:41.653
Well Danny old boy,
we made it again, Huh?

13:41.941 --> 13:42.373
Er...

13:42.901 --> 13:43.537
What's the matter?

13:44.699 --> 13:47.370
Well Hank,
I don't quite know how to tell you.

13:48.056 --> 13:49.090
What do you mean
I passed?

13:52.252 --> 13:55.128
Oh, I couldn't graduate -
not with my marks.

13:55.729 --> 13:56.444
What are you kiddin' me?

13:58.966 --> 14:00.920
Oh, listen there must
be some mistake.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.514
I'm not gonna
take this lyin' down.

14:04.202 --> 14:05.350
I'm gonna see
the Dean about it.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.668
They can't do this to me.

14:09.797 --> 14:10.751
Oh, Danny.

14:12.114 --> 14:13.546
Poor old Hank
he got careless.

14:14.952 --> 14:16.702
You didn't have anything
to do with this, did you?

14:17.670 --> 14:18.499
Why Ellen!

14:19.588 --> 14:21.975
Of course - a little peace and quiet
won't hurt either of us.

14:22.465 --> 14:23.533
But poor Hank.

14:23.664 --> 14:24.539
You still have me.

14:25.343 --> 14:28.412
I guess we'll have to carry on as good
old Hank would have wanted us to.

14:31.777 --> 14:33.175
It seems to me.

14:33.735 --> 14:34.723
It seems to you?

14:34.894 --> 14:36.292
I said it seems to me.

14:36.693 --> 14:38.249
You said it seems to you.

14:38.571 --> 14:40.639
It seems to me
I smell a mouse.

14:40.929 --> 14:42.724
Somewhere about the house.

14:43.127 --> 14:44.797
It seems to me.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.034
It seems to you.

14:46.464 --> 14:47.498
I said it seems to me.

14:47.663 --> 14:48.811
You said it seems to you.

14:49.062 --> 14:53.290
That such embarrassing situation
calls for concentration.

14:54.577 --> 14:55.406
Do you dig me Jack?

14:55.776 --> 14:56.969
We dig you Jack.

14:57.294 --> 14:58.170
Can you think of a plan?

14:58.334 --> 14:59.402
We solid can.

14:59.612 --> 15:00.601
To get me out
of this mess?

15:00.851 --> 15:02.124
Er- yes, yes, yes.

15:02.290 --> 15:04.483
We'll start the music
and play it back.

15:05.327 --> 15:06.077
Solid, Jack.

15:06.286 --> 15:07.196
Solid Jack.

15:09.883 --> 15:12.111
- Can ya sing and dance?
- I'll take a chance.

15:12.321 --> 15:14.787
- Are your boots on right?
- I got 'em laced up tight.

15:14.959 --> 15:17.346
- Is Miss Miller a killer?
- From Spanish villa.

15:17.556 --> 15:20.022
- Is her dancin' mellow?
- Why mello as a cello.

15:20.274 --> 15:22.911
Then it seems to me ob-vious-ly.

15:23.151 --> 15:25.299
Why not go right
into your terpischore?

15:25.709 --> 15:26.618
What will it be?

15:27.228 --> 15:28.057
Don't look at me.

15:28.906 --> 15:31.657
Now, let me see
what will it be?

15:33.023 --> 15:34.693
I never could do
the Conga

15:35.181 --> 15:36.771
Could never get
thru' the Conga.

15:37.379 --> 15:39.208
But if you say
'do the Conga'

15:39.457 --> 15:41.889
I ain't hep to that step.
but I'll dig it.

15:42.214 --> 15:44.090
I never could
see Mazurkas

15:44.332 --> 15:46.128
There poison to me
Mazurkas

15:46.650 --> 15:48.367
But if it's to be
Mazurkas

15:48.809 --> 15:51.366
I aint hep to that step
but I'll dig it

15:52.006 --> 15:53.801
When they invented
the Charleston

15:54.044 --> 15:55.237
He was a total flop.

15:55.682 --> 15:58.399
Right! But say -
if you want to Charleston

15:58.600 --> 16:00.554
I'll never stop
or dance till I drop.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.594
I never could
dig the polka.

16:03.316 --> 16:04.872
The corniest jig,
the polka.

16:05.514 --> 16:07.423
But if you say
dig the polka.

16:07.672 --> 16:10.945
I ain't hep to
that step but I'll dig it.

18:35.060 --> 18:35.731
Hi Hank.

18:36.139 --> 18:37.014
Hello there.

18:37.498 --> 18:38.486
Did you get anywhere
with the Dean?

18:38.777 --> 18:42.403
No, it seems that the article I wrote
on the decline of the harpsichord

18:42.574 --> 18:45.802
and her sister instruments
is what really put me across.

18:46.810 --> 18:47.400
Is that so?

18:47.569 --> 18:50.558
Yeah, funny I don't even
remember writing that article.

18:51.805 --> 18:54.681
Yet the Dean said it was so good, he
couldn't possibly think of flunking me.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.158
Tough luck.

18:56.521 --> 18:56.953
Yeah.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.712
Cheer up boy it's probably
all for the best.

19:00.518 --> 19:01.347
What have you
got there?

19:03.835 --> 19:05.789
Encyclopaedia.

19:06.472 --> 19:08.620
Think of it Hank.

19:09.589 --> 19:13.022
You'll go into your father's textile
business, a cog in a great industry.

19:13.466 --> 19:17.058
Stamping you personality
on miles and miles of tweed

19:17.982 --> 19:19.209
making the wheels turn.

19:19.381 --> 19:22.290
Punching the clock -
listening to the song of the looms -

19:25.335 --> 19:26.562
what volume is that?

19:27.733 --> 19:30.803
It's... Ham to llk.
Why?

19:31.090 --> 19:34.636
Oh, nothing.
Music wasn't for you, Hank.

19:35.766 --> 19:38.153
You could never have got anywhere
with that beat-up trumpet of yours.

19:39.083 --> 19:40.481
Your medium is textiles.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.517
Your father was a textile man -
so was his father before him.

19:43.879 --> 19:46.186
Why, you've got wool
in your blood Hank.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.826
What's the bookmark for?

19:51.032 --> 19:54.544
Oh, it's an article there -
rather interested the Dean.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.462
You know, funny thing
about that article.

19:59.625 --> 20:01.261
It's almost identical
with my thesis.

20:03.381 --> 20:04.336
Interesting coincidence.

20:04.580 --> 20:05.898
Yes, that's what
the Dean thought.

20:07.565 --> 20:11.555
I had quite a time persuading him
that the marginal notes weren't mine.

20:12.361 --> 20:16.067
As a matter of fact, I tried to convince
him that the handwriting wasn't yours.

20:17.336 --> 20:18.007
Yeah?

20:18.375 --> 20:18.773
Yeah.

20:18.975 --> 20:19.804
What did he say?

20:20.414 --> 20:21.562
He said you were fired.

20:21.972 --> 20:22.609
You dog!

20:22.811 --> 20:23.687
Now, take it easy,
Danny.

20:23.851 --> 20:25.282
You low,
conniving dog!

20:25.449 --> 20:27.120
You too will have
to face the world.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.805
Fall right into your
father's concrete.

20:29.006 --> 20:30.233
You'll be a cog
within a cog.

20:30.405 --> 20:31.995
You can't get away
from it, Danny my boy.

20:32.163 --> 20:33.561
You've got concrete
in your bones.

20:34.401 --> 20:39.266
Danny, hey! Hurry!
Wonderful news!

20:40.076 --> 20:41.030
A telegram!

20:41.715 --> 20:44.545
"Will be in town Saturday. Would like
to look over your outfit. " Artie Shaw.

20:44.752 --> 20:45.820
Well, what do you know?

20:45.991 --> 20:48.627
Hey, well there it is.
Shaw wants to look me over.

20:48.868 --> 20:50.220
Look you over?
Look us over.

20:50.387 --> 20:53.615
Alright, us. Hmm, seems to be
in a kind of a rush about it.

20:54.183 --> 20:55.501
I wonder how soon
he wants me to start.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.531
Hey, it didn't take him long
to find out I'd be available, did it?

20:57.860 --> 20:59.292
You'll be available indefinitely,
I'm afraid.

20:59.619 --> 21:03.052
Yeah. Now then, first thing tomorrow,
I must find Ellen a new job.

21:03.215 --> 21:05.727
Don't bother.
As soon as I get set, I'll send for you.

21:06.013 --> 21:07.161
Oh, that's very kind of you.

21:07.372 --> 21:08.645
Alright. Let's get organised.

21:08.890 --> 21:10.845
Call the boys and tell them
to be there early. Summer uniforms.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.964
And you - you go home
and run your scales. Come on!

21:22.958 --> 21:24.912
Look, fella. Don't bury it.
I'll be out in a few minutes.

21:25.755 --> 21:26.709
Artie Shaw!

21:44.698 --> 21:45.732
Artie Shaw, he's here!

21:45.897 --> 21:46.693
Good, thanks.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.925
Hey, what about
the buck you promised me?

21:51.612 --> 21:53.249
Alright, alright beat it.

21:57.127 --> 21:59.003
OK, gang. Sweet Sue.

21:59.845 --> 22:01.913
Hank!
Shaw, he's coming in now!

22:02.123 --> 22:02.679
Swell. Thanks, pal.

22:04.161 --> 22:05.070
Come on, give out.

22:09.316 --> 22:10.430
I'll bring you
some change.

22:14.592 --> 22:16.421
Now, a nice and easy background
on this one, boys.

22:16.950 --> 22:18.461
Hey, Danny.
Why don't you lay out on this one?

22:18.628 --> 22:20.140
Save your lip till Shaw comes.
I'll take the lead.

22:20.307 --> 22:21.056
Are you kiddin'?

22:21.226 --> 22:22.544
I'm OK, I've been
in the woodshed.

22:24.183 --> 22:26.217
You've been in the cornfield.
Alright, boys. One-two.

23:00.591 --> 23:02.659
Say, that's quite a little
shindig you're pitchin' in there.

23:03.108 --> 23:04.381
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Shaw.

23:04.547 --> 23:05.899
Band on straight
salary or percentage?

23:06.226 --> 23:07.021
Oh, percentage.

23:07.425 --> 23:07.981
Oh smart, uh!

23:08.384 --> 23:09.418
Thanks again, Mr. Shaw.

23:09.703 --> 23:10.498
Where's Mr. Miller?

23:10.782 --> 23:11.497
Mr. Miller?

23:11.701 --> 23:12.655
Yeah,
the manager of the band.

23:13.379 --> 23:16.494
Oh, that Mr. Miller...
There she is.

23:27.247 --> 23:29.475
This is Mr. Shaw, Mr. Miller -
I mean, er...

23:29.965 --> 23:30.874
We've been expecting you,
Mr. Shaw.

23:31.044 --> 23:34.033
Swell. If you're not too busy, I'd like
to talk to you for a few minutes.

23:34.321 --> 23:34.991
Fine.

24:17.043 --> 24:18.520
Won't you stay
and hear the band, Mr. Shaw?

24:18.761 --> 24:21.114
I'd like to but I'm on my way
down to Trenton to play a date.

24:21.479 --> 24:22.705
Anyway, it was nice
talking to you.

24:22.877 --> 24:24.309
- Thanks and goodnight.
- Goodnight.

24:33.188 --> 24:33.937
Thanks.

24:34.067 --> 24:35.022
No trouble.

24:37.304 --> 24:38.259
Where is he?

24:38.503 --> 24:39.253
He's gone.

24:39.423 --> 24:39.979
Gone?

24:40.102 --> 24:42.056
- Where's Shaw? What did he say?
- He's gone. You ruined it.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.335
What are you talkin' about?
I was terrific. When do I start?

24:44.498 --> 24:45.293
Oh, take ten, son.

24:45.857 --> 24:46.891
What was his proposition?

24:47.056 --> 24:49.204
Well, his proposition
rather surprised me.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.170
Oh!

24:50.293 --> 24:51.122
Quibbled about salary?

24:51.292 --> 24:52.610
Wait a minute,
I don't work on Sundays.

24:52.811 --> 24:54.925
Look, Ellen,
what gives? When do I start?

24:55.648 --> 24:56.239
You don't.

24:56.607 --> 24:58.358
What?
Well, then what did he want?

25:00.724 --> 25:00.996
Me.

25:14.152 --> 25:15.220
- Ellen!
- Oh, Danny!

25:15.390 --> 25:16.425
I brought you this!

25:17.189 --> 25:20.622
Oh, I guess I'm a little late.

25:20.866 --> 25:24.219
Oh, Danny. How darling of you.
Hank's inside getting a ticket.

25:24.462 --> 25:25.212
Is he?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.690
Gosh, Ellen,
I hate to see you go.

25:29.458 --> 25:31.015
Oh, I hate to go,
Danny.

25:31.216 --> 25:33.046
I - I kinda
hoped that...

25:33.215 --> 25:34.124
What Danny?

25:34.573 --> 25:37.210
Oh, nothing. I guess
it was just silly, that's all.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.729
No, it wasn't.
What was it?

25:38.890 --> 25:40.879
Excuse me.
You're sprouting.

25:41.128 --> 25:43.844
Here's some popcorn. Sonny, hold this
for the lady. Here's your ticket, Ellen.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.518
Come on, I'll tell the conductor
when to let you off.

25:58.592 --> 26:01.104
Now, be a good girl
and don't talk to any strange men.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.582
I won't.
I'll see you in New York?

26:02.868 --> 26:03.936
- I hope so.
- Yes.

26:04.594 --> 26:07.186
Well, I don't know.
Portland's a long way from New York

26:07.431 --> 26:08.988
and concrete
kinda holds a man down.

26:09.470 --> 26:11.459
Well,
you'll be there, Hank?

26:12.107 --> 26:15.892
No. I've gotta pay a lot of attention
to those mills in Fall River.

26:16.583 --> 26:17.492
Well, I won't be seeing
either of you?

26:17.662 --> 26:18.333
No.

26:19.381 --> 26:20.256
Well, I'm afraid not.

26:20.819 --> 26:22.137
All aboard!

26:22.578 --> 26:24.806
- Well, goodbye, you idiots.
- Goodbye. Look after her orchids.

26:25.695 --> 26:26.683
Goodbye!

26:28.972 --> 26:29.688
Bye!

26:32.809 --> 26:34.843
- When do you start for Portland?
- Tonight.

26:36.765 --> 26:39.561
- When do you leave for Fall River?
- Oh, about an hour.

26:40.882 --> 26:41.950
I'll see you off.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.632
No, don't bother.
You've got to pack.

26:44.159 --> 26:48.034
Yeah. Well, this is it.

26:48.275 --> 26:49.707
Right. So long, Danny.

26:50.073 --> 26:53.143
- So long, kid. It's been a lot of fun.
- You bet it has. Take care of yourself.

26:53.350 --> 26:54.419
- I'll drop you a line.
- Do that.

27:10.855 --> 27:13.730
A college band?
Whoever heard of a good college band?

27:15.491 --> 27:18.958
Oh, we were under the impression
that this was an important affair.

27:20.047 --> 27:21.001
Oh, it is.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.359
Oh well in that case,
I know you'll want Mr. Shaw.

27:24.443 --> 27:25.874
That's fine. Thank you.

27:32.316 --> 27:33.304
A couple of relatives.

27:33.555 --> 27:34.623
Well, what's cookin', Ellen?

27:34.873 --> 27:36.908
We close the Atlantic City job
on our own terms.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.101
That's swell.

27:38.590 --> 27:39.578
And the intercollegiate prom.

27:40.109 --> 27:43.416
Not a bad two day's work. Looks like
my hunch about you was pretty good.

27:43.666 --> 27:47.291
I'm glad. Mr. Shaw, I...
I wonder if I could ask you a favour.

27:47.502 --> 27:48.173
Of course.

27:48.341 --> 27:50.217
It's - it's about
a couple of trumpet players.

27:50.939 --> 27:53.894
Oh, well, you see I always pick
my own men, Ellen and I don't...

27:54.176 --> 27:56.086
Of course, but all I want you to do
is hear these boys.

27:56.254 --> 27:58.368
- They're marvellous.
- Where are they? Around town?

27:58.532 --> 28:00.487
Practically. One's in Portland
and the other's in Fall River.

28:00.770 --> 28:01.680
But they could be here in a jiffy.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.247
Isn't that a lot
of travellin' just for an audition?

28:03.408 --> 28:05.476
But they wouldn't mind. And once you
hear them, you'll know what I mean.

28:05.926 --> 28:07.596
If you think they're that good,
I'll listen to them.

28:07.924 --> 28:09.197
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

28:10.202 --> 28:13.953
Call the Western Union boy to pick up
two telegrams. Thank you.

28:19.074 --> 28:22.029
- What floor is Artie Shaw on?
- Seventeenth.

28:23.230 --> 28:23.867
Going up.

28:24.229 --> 28:24.900
Hold it, buddy.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.810
- What floor is Artie Shaw on?
- Seventeenth.

28:40.455 --> 28:42.762
Aren't you going
to Fall River the hard way?

28:45.171 --> 28:46.841
I suppose this elevator
stops at Portland.

28:47.089 --> 28:49.078
No, sir.
Last stop is the 22nd floor.

28:51.085 --> 28:53.278
So you were going
to give a lot of time to the mills.

28:53.403 --> 28:55.869
Listen, I've got as much right
here as you have.

28:56.281 --> 28:58.634
Why don't you face facts, Hank?
Ellen's not even established yet.

28:58.758 --> 29:00.110
She can't possibly
get us both in the band.

29:00.237 --> 29:01.430
I'm going to get
a try-out with Artie Shaw

29:01.596 --> 29:03.585
if I have to tear down
this building floor by floor.

29:03.794 --> 29:05.112
17th floor next.

29:07.551 --> 29:08.982
Here's a present
for you, Sam.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.383
Have one on me, Sam.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.415
Oh, excuse me.

29:18.581 --> 29:20.729
- Where's Artie Shaw's office, please?
- Right that way.

29:20.899 --> 29:21.535
Oh, thanks.

29:26.893 --> 29:29.564
Mr... Mr. Taylor to see Miss Miller.

29:29.691 --> 29:30.884
Miss Miller's very busy
right now.

29:31.050 --> 29:33.959
She'll see me,
we went to college together.

29:34.287 --> 29:36.798
Hey, is that 34 or 54
Highcroft Road?

29:36.924 --> 29:39.959
34. Hey, wait a minute.
What have you got there?

29:40.841 --> 29:41.716
Why, this is for me!

29:41.880 --> 29:42.629
Yeah.

29:43.598 --> 29:45.030
Hank, Shaw's
sending for me.

29:45.157 --> 29:47.589
Me too. You know, I knew he'd
get around to that sooner or later.

29:47.875 --> 29:48.829
Any answers?

29:49.074 --> 29:50.903
We'll take care of the answers, bud.
Here.

29:51.152 --> 29:51.901
Thanks.

29:52.231 --> 29:52.742
It's alright.

29:54.029 --> 29:56.222
- What do you make of this?
- Look at that, Fall River.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.336
Say! Excuse me...

30:03.221 --> 30:04.448
Something phony about this.

30:04.580 --> 30:05.329
Yeah.

30:05.619 --> 30:07.175
He walked out on us
at the Prom, didn't he?

30:07.297 --> 30:08.047
Yeah.

30:08.536 --> 30:10.570
- You don't suppose it was deliberate?
- Why would he?

30:10.814 --> 30:13.803
You mean he'd want us to cool
for a while so we'd work for peanuts.

30:14.051 --> 30:15.449
Listen, we're not that hard
to get.

30:15.610 --> 30:17.485
No. But then he got Ellen
down here as a decoy,

30:17.688 --> 30:19.279
thinking we'd work for nothing
on account of her.

30:19.446 --> 30:21.401
That's it.
How do ya like it?

30:21.645 --> 30:23.599
I don't like it.
He can't treat a friend of ours like that.

30:23.763 --> 30:24.592
No, sir!

30:25.121 --> 30:27.713
I'll fix him. Just for that, I'm gonna
ask for 25 dollars a week more.

30:27.959 --> 30:28.674
Fifty!

30:29.278 --> 30:31.107
Young lady, you can tell Shaw
that we'll see him.

30:31.356 --> 30:32.185
Mr. Shaw is very busy.

30:32.355 --> 30:33.867
Never mind, we'll tell him.
Thanks. Come on, Hank.

30:35.392 --> 30:36.346
Hey, wait a minute.

30:38.110 --> 30:38.666
Hi, Shaw.

30:38.829 --> 30:40.705
Now, just a minute, fellas.
You'll have to wait outside.

30:40.867 --> 30:42.379
I'm the new trumpet player
you just sent for.

30:42.546 --> 30:44.262
And me too.
We've just got your wire.

30:44.904 --> 30:45.972
What the...?

30:46.263 --> 30:48.728
Oh, yeah-well, you certainly
took your time getting here.

30:50.858 --> 30:52.654
Well, we had a couple
of other offers to consider.

30:52.857 --> 30:54.447
Alright, boys,
I tell you what you do.

30:54.615 --> 30:56.729
Drop down to the hotel tonight and
play a couple of tunes for the band.

30:57.213 --> 30:58.486
- That'll be swell.
- Love to.

30:58.971 --> 31:00.562
See you then,
I'm sorry, I'm pretty busy now.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.758
Well, that's alright.
Which is Miss Miler's office?

31:02.968 --> 31:03.877
Right across the hall.

31:04.406 --> 31:06.713
Oh, thanks. Think I'll have
a little talk with her.

31:10.281 --> 31:12.952
OK, Artie -
ha, ha, ha.

31:17.794 --> 31:18.544
Ellen!

31:19.113 --> 31:21.784
Danny! I can't believe
my eyes.

31:21.991 --> 31:23.820
It's so good
to see you.

31:24.588 --> 31:25.815
Kinda surprised you,
huh?

31:25.947 --> 31:27.220
Kinda surprised you,
huh?

31:27.346 --> 31:28.903
And Hank,
wherever did you come from?

31:29.064 --> 31:29.894
Artie Shaw's office.

31:30.063 --> 31:30.973
We were just talking
a little business.

31:31.622 --> 31:32.337
But Portland?

31:32.701 --> 31:33.974
Portland's loss
is your gain.

31:34.220 --> 31:34.969
And Fall River?

31:35.099 --> 31:36.326
Fall River will have
to suffer too.

31:36.738 --> 31:38.215
Did Artie say anything
about giving you a try-out?

31:38.376 --> 31:39.125
Oh, sure.

31:39.295 --> 31:40.773
Oh, darlings,
that's wonderful!

31:40.974 --> 31:42.451
Yes, but we haven't
promised him anything yet.

31:54.761 --> 31:55.671
Straight ahead.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.428
Hey, there!

31:57.599 --> 31:58.314
Good evening, Cap.

31:58.798 --> 32:00.310
I'm the new trumpet
player with Artie Shaw.

32:00.556 --> 32:01.783
I ain't never seen
you before.

32:02.235 --> 32:04.144
It's alright, you're going
to see plenty of me from now on.

32:04.872 --> 32:07.703
Oh, by the way. If my brother
happens to drop around here tonight,

32:08.030 --> 32:10.461
tell him that Shaw's not giving
any more auditions, see.

32:10.867 --> 32:13.140
If he makes a fuss,
just throw him out.

32:13.944 --> 32:16.934
You know how these little
family jealousies are. Thanks.

32:17.141 --> 32:18.176
What's your name?

32:18.740 --> 32:21.377
Danny O...
O' Taylor.

32:36.284 --> 32:38.080
Danny, I'm so glad
you got here early.

32:38.243 --> 32:40.674
I was lonesome. I haven't seen you
since late this afternoon.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.350
Not a bad house.
How long are we booked here for?

32:44.837 --> 32:46.314
You're only booked
for one number.

32:46.635 --> 32:48.942
This audition?
Mere formality.

32:49.393 --> 32:49.983
Where's Hank?

32:50.112 --> 32:50.749
Hank?

32:50.991 --> 32:53.344
How do I know?
Am I my brother's keeper?

32:53.549 --> 32:54.947
I thought he was coming
with you.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.301
He probably got
cold feet.

32:56.586 --> 32:58.541
Couldn't face the humiliation
of being turned down.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.417
Poor boy, I wish I could
do something to help him.

33:03.100 --> 33:04.010
Oh, yes.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.047
Ah, now, Ellen.
I'm very fond of Hank.

33:07.217 --> 33:08.728
After all, he did bring
us together.

33:09.135 --> 33:10.533
If it hadn't been
for those encyclopaedias

33:10.694 --> 33:11.921
I might never have met you.

33:12.172 --> 33:14.048
I'll always be grateful
to him for that.

33:15.370 --> 33:16.358
Won't you?

33:17.248 --> 33:19.362
- Danny, this is no time.
- Yes, it is. This is just the time.

33:19.806 --> 33:21.999
Yesterday, what was I?
A carefree schoolboy.

33:22.124 --> 33:24.681
Today what?
A man with his career assured,

33:24.841 --> 33:26.830
a man with plans
for the future.

33:27.838 --> 33:29.873
Danny, don't you think
you ought to be warming up?

33:30.076 --> 33:31.906
I've been warmed up
a long time.

33:33.833 --> 33:34.742
Ellen...

33:37.830 --> 33:39.705
Shall I take
the vocal?

33:40.427 --> 33:43.939
Would you like to be
the love of my life

33:45.463 --> 33:47.736
for always.

33:48.980 --> 33:54.368
And always watch over me.

33:56.573 --> 34:02.881
To square my blunders
and share my dreams.

34:05.125 --> 34:07.717
One day with caviar.

34:09.002 --> 34:11.717
Next day a chocolate bar.

34:12.638 --> 34:16.025
Would you like
to take the merry-go-round,

34:17.793 --> 34:20.181
I'll lead you

34:21.351 --> 34:27.056
I need you - just wait
till you see.

34:28.944 --> 34:32.058
I hope in your horoscope

34:32.181 --> 34:36.012
There is room
for a dope who adores you.

34:37.177 --> 34:40.484
That would make the only
dream of my life...

34:42.172 --> 34:43.570
come true.

34:45.449 --> 34:48.359
For the love
of my life...

34:51.164 --> 34:52.357
is you.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.668
Ellen.

35:01.555 --> 35:03.067
So, I'm your brother,
huh?

35:03.234 --> 35:04.631
I was afraid you
wouldn't make it.

35:04.752 --> 35:06.821
You shouldn't worry about me,
brother Danny.

35:06.990 --> 35:08.024
Ellen, I think
you'd better leave.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.183
No, no, stick around.

35:09.348 --> 35:10.098
What happened, Hank?

35:10.227 --> 35:12.023
Brother Danny here
framed me with the doorman.

35:12.186 --> 35:13.822
All I wanted was to be
alone with you for once.

35:13.984 --> 35:15.336
See that?
He admits the whole thing.

35:15.463 --> 35:17.577
- Oh, now wait a minute.
- That doorman hit me in the lip.

35:17.701 --> 35:18.496
- He did?
- Yeah.

35:19.539 --> 35:21.290
- Oh, that's too bad.
- How'd you like to even it up, huh?

35:21.457 --> 35:23.333
Oh no, boys, please.
You have to go on in a minute.

35:23.456 --> 35:24.967
You're putting me
in an awful position.

35:25.134 --> 35:28.328
Now, come on, let's forget it. I'll tell
Artie you're here. Good luck, darlings.

35:30.184 --> 35:30.933
Yeah, darlings.

35:39.296 --> 35:40.852
You haven't forgotten
the two trumpet players?

35:40.974 --> 35:41.962
No, I'll be right with you.

36:12.107 --> 36:12.618
Quick, let's go.

36:14.305 --> 36:17.260
I'll put your boys on, but first give me
a hand with that character over there.

36:17.622 --> 36:19.815
He's been here ten nights in a row.
He's an awful ear bend.

36:27.213 --> 36:28.201
Well, well.

36:28.372 --> 36:29.770
Mr. Chisholm,
this is Miss Miller.

36:29.931 --> 36:30.726
How do you do,
Miss Miller?

36:30.890 --> 36:32.844
Well, sir, did that last number
jump for you?

36:33.008 --> 36:34.758
Oh, very peppy.
Very peppy indeed.

36:35.046 --> 36:36.558
By the way,
what chord did we finish on?

36:37.164 --> 36:38.073
Er, B flat.

36:38.563 --> 36:39.881
Shaw, I missed it again.

36:40.162 --> 36:41.150
Won't you two join me?

36:41.281 --> 36:43.076
I'm sorry, I've got to get back
and play the next number.

36:43.199 --> 36:44.755
But Miss Miller
can tell you all about the band.

36:44.917 --> 36:47.873
- Is Miss Miller hep as you boys say?
- Hep as they come.

36:47.995 --> 36:51.064
Fascinating, swing jargon.
I'm becoming hep to it myself.

36:51.352 --> 36:53.659
- Well, see you later, Mr. Chisholm.
- So long, gate.

36:55.068 --> 36:57.899
That's short for alligator.
Please be seated.

36:59.185 --> 37:00.696
Are you a musician,
Mr. Chisholm?

37:00.863 --> 37:03.011
Oh, I should have been
but I was forced to give it up.

37:03.421 --> 37:07.047
I said music and father said
bottle caps. Father won.

37:07.297 --> 37:10.014
Oh, what a pity. I take it
that the banjo is your instrument.

37:10.295 --> 37:13.045
Oh, no, the mandolin.
The flat-back mandolin.

37:13.572 --> 37:15.720
Alright, you're on.
What do you want to play?

37:15.850 --> 37:17.440
How about
"I'm Yours"?

37:17.728 --> 37:19.557
That's a tough
arrangement to play at sight.

37:19.726 --> 37:21.477
I'll play anything
that's on the paper.

37:21.804 --> 37:22.918
OK. How about you?

37:24.322 --> 37:25.276
Pick one.

37:25.401 --> 37:26.594
Alright, I'll leave the book with you.
Look 'em over.

37:26.840 --> 37:30.829
Artie! On the question of who plays first,
may I suggest alphabetical order -

37:30.956 --> 37:32.388
in the interest of fairness?

37:32.555 --> 37:35.271
Sure, OK. Alright,
we're on in about three minutes.

37:38.030 --> 37:39.700
What's the matter? Aren't you
going to look over your parts?

37:40.308 --> 37:43.297
I couldn't hit a bad note
if I tried. Not tonight.

37:43.465 --> 37:44.692
Why is tonight
an exception?

37:45.783 --> 37:47.215
Oh, I don't know.

37:47.501 --> 37:50.888
It makes all the difference when you
know someone's depending on you.

37:51.378 --> 37:52.127
What?

37:53.097 --> 37:54.733
Oh, nothing, nothing
nothing at all

37:55.335 --> 37:56.482
Who's depending
on you?

37:59.331 --> 38:01.524
Nobody. Forget it, Hank,
forget it.

38:01.929 --> 38:05.043
Say, you were alone here
with Ellen when I came in.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.154
For almost the first time
since I've known her.

38:08.403 --> 38:10.869
Yeah? Well, what happened?
What did you say to her?

38:12.120 --> 38:14.472
Look, Hank.
Ellen and I...

38:15.517 --> 38:17.028
I don't suppose it's
any concern of yours,

38:17.155 --> 38:20.861
but when I get set with Shaw,
Ellen and I...

38:21.032 --> 38:23.543
You proposed to her.
What did she say?

38:23.909 --> 38:27.535
She just looked at me and gave her
tender unspoken yes.

38:28.585 --> 38:30.699
How do you know
it wasn't an unspoken no?

38:31.542 --> 38:32.610
A fella can tell.

38:32.901 --> 38:36.095
One of those rare occasions when
silence was more eloquent than words.

38:37.137 --> 38:37.649
Yeah?

38:38.296 --> 38:38.808
Yeah.

38:41.373 --> 38:46.762
Alright. That's the way it is. I wish
you all the happiness in the world.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.123
Have me over
for dinner sometime.

38:50.605 --> 38:52.162
- Thanks, Hank.
- Alright.

38:52.603 --> 38:54.160
I'm glad you're not gonna
let this come between us.

39:24.455 --> 39:25.330
OK. Here we go.

39:25.814 --> 39:27.848
Here we are, Danny. You know
what I wish you, Danny boy.

39:28.012 --> 39:28.488
Yeah.

40:32.314 --> 40:33.349
Fascinating music.

40:34.153 --> 40:35.426
I can't understand it.

40:54.135 --> 40:56.647
Well, that was just dandy.
I'll be sure and call you.

40:57.012 --> 40:58.967
In the meanwhile, if anything
else comes up, take it!
