Previously on
Young Sheldon...

00:02.394 --> 00:04.546
I did not give you
a heart attack.

00:04.875 --> 00:06.131
You gave me something.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.616
Well...

00:08.563 --> 00:10.898
Is my husband your mystery man?

00:11.607 --> 00:13.192
Can't believe this.

00:13.192 --> 00:14.861
Where you going?
Home.

00:14.861 --> 00:16.571
They clearly
forgot about us.

00:17.822 --> 00:19.031
This sucks.

00:19.031 --> 00:20.074
What is he
doing here?

00:20.074 --> 00:21.367
He's a pastor,

00:21.367 --> 00:22.952
and he wanted
to be here.

00:22.952 --> 00:24.245
I mean, what is he doing here

00:24.245 --> 00:25.496
with you?

00:25.496 --> 00:27.707
I'm gonna stay
at my mom's house tonight.

00:27.707 --> 00:28.875
Fine by me.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.334
Where's Missy?

♪ Here we go ♪

00:36.799 --> 00:37.884
♪ No ♪

00:37.884 --> 00:38.968
Missy.

00:40.803 --> 00:42.680
♪ No way... ♪

00:42.680 --> 00:45.266
Careful, loud music is a sign
of teen angst.

00:45.266 --> 00:46.475
I'm aware.

00:47.643 --> 00:49.186
Missy honey, I'm so sorry.

00:49.186 --> 00:51.439
You okay?

00:53.482 --> 00:55.234
Come on, let me in.

00:56.986 --> 00:58.237
You forgot me.

00:58.237 --> 00:59.572
Mandy went
into labor.

00:59.572 --> 01:00.823
I had to go
to the hospital.

01:00.823 --> 01:02.783
She had the baby,
and no one told me?

01:02.783 --> 01:04.076
See? Angst.

01:04.076 --> 01:05.161
Go in your room.

01:05.161 --> 01:07.496
The baby's cute as a button.

01:07.496 --> 01:09.165
Can't wait to meet
her Aunt Missy.

01:09.165 --> 01:12.084
I waited at school for an hour
and had to walk home.

01:12.084 --> 01:13.419
No one even called.

01:13.419 --> 01:15.254
There was a lot going on.

01:15.254 --> 01:16.631
The important thing is,

01:16.631 --> 01:18.049
you're safe,

01:18.049 --> 01:19.508
baby's safe,
everything turned out okay.

01:19.508 --> 01:21.218
Not everything.
My database failed.

01:21.218 --> 01:22.929
Go.

01:22.929 --> 01:24.347
Where's Mom?

01:26.223 --> 01:27.683
She's staying
at your meemaw's tonight.

01:27.683 --> 01:28.935
Why?

01:28.935 --> 01:30.311
Help with the baby.

01:30.311 --> 01:32.939
So, the baby's home?
I can meet her?

01:32.939 --> 01:34.523
She'll be home tomorrow.

01:34.523 --> 01:36.609
Then why's Mom there tonight?

01:37.944 --> 01:40.488
Look, Missy,
I've had a long day.
So have I.

01:40.488 --> 01:42.031
That makes three of us. Sheldon.

01:42.031 --> 01:43.783
I'm in my room, as directed.

She's fine.

02:17.358 --> 02:18.693
She's quiet.

02:18.693 --> 02:20.903
She's breathing, right?

02:20.903 --> 02:23.322
Yes. Hold on.

02:24.490 --> 02:25.825
Yes.

02:25.825 --> 02:27.785
Mind slowing down?

02:28.744 --> 02:30.246
I'm going 15.

02:30.246 --> 02:32.164
And I said slow down.

02:32.164 --> 02:33.249
You got it.

02:35.167 --> 02:36.877
Baby check.
Still breathing.

02:36.877 --> 02:39.422
All right,
we got this.

02:39.422 --> 02:41.841
You remembered to check
the baby's I.D. bracelet

02:41.841 --> 02:43.509
before we left
the hospital, right?

02:43.509 --> 02:45.761
Why?
To make sure
they gave us the right baby.

02:45.761 --> 02:47.930
Don't be ridiculous,
I know my baby.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.557
This is her.

02:50.599 --> 02:51.934
Yeah, this is her.

02:51.934 --> 02:53.519
Good. I saw this

02:53.519 --> 02:55.312
Maury Povich show
where there was a mix-up,

02:55.312 --> 02:57.189
and one family
got a real clunker.

02:57.189 --> 02:59.567
Well, if she's a clunker,
she's our clunker.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.402
Great.

03:04.864 --> 03:06.032
Morning.

03:06.032 --> 03:07.742
Hello.

03:07.742 --> 03:08.951
You're up early.

03:09.910 --> 03:12.288
Gave myself extra time in
case I had to walk again.

03:13.414 --> 03:14.832
I'm taking you
to school.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.752
Lots of kids walk,
by the way.

03:17.752 --> 03:18.961
Like Billy?

03:18.961 --> 03:20.463
His mom didn't
show up either.

03:20.463 --> 03:22.256
It was sad, but I can laugh
about it now.

03:22.256 --> 03:23.424
Enough.

03:25.092 --> 03:27.595
So, is Mom
coming home tonight?

03:27.595 --> 03:29.388
I don't know.

03:29.388 --> 03:31.766
What's really going on
with you two?

03:31.766 --> 03:32.933
'Cause Billy said
you and Brenda...

03:32.933 --> 03:34.602
Drop it.

03:34.602 --> 03:36.562
Fine.

03:36.562 --> 03:39.982
Well, since Mom's not here,
I made your lunch.

03:39.982 --> 03:42.026
That was nice.

03:45.488 --> 03:48.074
"Try not forgetting
your daughter today.

03:48.074 --> 03:49.742
XO, Missy."

03:49.742 --> 03:52.787
That's my name,
in case you forgot.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.959
The next day,
as I walked across campus,

03:58.959 --> 04:00.920
I could feel
all eyes were on me,

04:00.920 --> 04:03.172
judging me for my failure.

04:03.172 --> 04:04.965
Look at them laughing at me.

04:04.965 --> 04:07.551
It was the closest I ever came
to a walk of shame.

04:07.551 --> 04:10.096
Well, good morning, Sheldon.

04:10.096 --> 04:11.806
What's good about it?

04:11.806 --> 04:13.099
I'm a laughingstock.

04:13.099 --> 04:15.267
I don't think
anybody cares.

04:15.267 --> 04:16.685
But my database failed.

04:16.685 --> 04:19.939
Failure only means something
if you quit.

04:19.939 --> 04:23.150
Well, get ready for
some meaning. I quit.

04:23.150 --> 04:24.777
Hang on.

04:24.777 --> 04:26.987
Are you familiar
with the Fred Astaire song

04:26.987 --> 04:28.489
"Pick Yourself Up"?

04:28.489 --> 04:29.657
No.

04:29.657 --> 04:32.743
From the beloved musical
Swing Time?

04:32.743 --> 04:33.953
Still no.

04:33.953 --> 04:36.705
Then prepare
to be uplifted.

04:37.706 --> 04:40.292
♪ Nothing's impossible,
I have found ♪

04:40.292 --> 04:42.711
♪ For when my chin
is on the ground ♪

04:42.711 --> 04:44.296
♪ I pick myself up ♪

04:44.296 --> 04:45.631
♪ Dust myself off ♪

04:45.631 --> 04:48.676
♪ Start all over again ♪

04:49.677 --> 04:50.928
I'm not uplifted.

04:50.928 --> 04:53.097
Well, then buckle up
for the second verse.

04:53.097 --> 04:56.016
♪ Don't lose your
confidence if you slip ♪

04:56.016 --> 04:58.644
♪ Be grateful for

05:00.104 --> 05:01.397

05:01.397 --> 05:03.566

05:05.651 --> 05:07.319
Maybe it's gas.
Did you burp her?

05:07.319 --> 05:08.821
What do you think I was doing

05:08.821 --> 05:10.072
when I was patting her
on the back?

05:10.072 --> 05:11.407
Did you pat firmly?

05:11.407 --> 05:12.950
The book says
"pat firmly."

05:12.950 --> 05:14.493
It was firm, Georgie.

05:14.493 --> 05:16.162
Maybe you need to be burped.

05:16.162 --> 05:19.248
Okay, you're such an expert,
why don't you try?

05:20.207 --> 05:22.918
All right. I was a baby
more recently than you were.

05:22.918 --> 05:24.962
It's okay, CeeCee,

05:24.962 --> 05:26.338
Daddy's here.

05:26.338 --> 05:27.882
Shh...

05:27.882 --> 05:29.675
Good job.

05:29.675 --> 05:32.344
Well, I just met her yesterday,
give me a minute.

05:32.344 --> 05:35.264
I remember those days.
Me, too.

05:35.264 --> 05:37.975
Boy, were you a crier.

05:37.975 --> 05:39.185
Sorry.

05:39.185 --> 05:40.978
Too little, too late.

05:40.978 --> 05:42.980
Should I help 'em out?

05:42.980 --> 05:44.106
I got it.

05:44.106 --> 05:45.858
Come on, CeeCee,
work with me.

05:45.858 --> 05:47.401
This is your father speaking.

05:47.401 --> 05:49.069
Did she quiet down?

05:49.069 --> 05:50.446
'Cause she doesn't
sound quiet.

05:50.446 --> 05:51.906
Step aside.

05:51.906 --> 05:53.699
Let me show you
how it's done.

05:53.699 --> 05:57.077
Please.
Come here. Okay. Yeah.

05:57.077 --> 05:59.413
Meemaw's here now, all right.

05:59.413 --> 06:00.956
Shh...

06:00.956 --> 06:02.208
Shh, shh.

06:02.208 --> 06:04.543
Shh. Something's wrong
with this one.

06:04.543 --> 06:06.670
Can her grandma
have a turn?

06:06.670 --> 06:08.255
Here, take her. Oh...

06:08.255 --> 06:10.257
She takes after you. Oh.

06:10.257 --> 06:13.385
It's okay, sweetie, Nana's here.

06:13.385 --> 06:15.387
Nana? Who picked that?

06:15.387 --> 06:16.764
I did.

06:16.764 --> 06:18.098
Why ain't you another meemaw?

06:18.098 --> 06:20.142
'Cause I'm
the only meemaw.

06:22.228 --> 06:24.438
Oh, you got her to quiet down.
How'd you do that?

06:24.438 --> 06:26.398
Nana magic.

06:26.398 --> 06:27.733
Okay, well,

06:27.733 --> 06:29.610
I'm gonna
get some sleep,

06:29.610 --> 06:31.362
and I may never
come back.

06:34.281 --> 06:35.783
Hmm.

06:38.619 --> 06:41.038
I don't understand.
The code is perfect.

06:41.038 --> 06:42.665
It should have worked.

06:42.665 --> 06:44.583
Well, the problem
isn't that it didn't work,

06:44.583 --> 06:47.086
the problem is that
nobody wanted to use it.

06:47.086 --> 06:50.256
So, you're saying we didn't
fail, the public failed us.

06:50.256 --> 06:52.007
No, we failed.

06:52.007 --> 06:54.468
And you've also failed
at cheering me up, so good job.

06:54.468 --> 06:56.262
Here's a thought.

06:56.262 --> 06:57.596
I've been toying around

06:57.596 --> 07:00.224
with this new plasma
confinement idea.

07:00.224 --> 07:02.059
Why don't we
work on that

07:02.059 --> 07:04.603
and, uh, take your mind
off the database?

07:04.603 --> 07:06.105
What if we fail at that, too?

07:06.105 --> 07:08.065
Then we'll have
two failures back to back.

07:08.065 --> 07:10.150
I'll have to leave the country
or grow a mustache,

07:10.150 --> 07:12.069
or leave the country
until I can grow a mustache.

07:12.069 --> 07:14.989
Well, we don't know
if we'll fail until we try.

07:14.989 --> 07:18.450
if we don't try,
we'll never fail.

07:18.450 --> 07:20.577
Oh, my little pal,

07:20.577 --> 07:22.955
do I have to
sing again?

07:22.955 --> 07:25.291
Little?
I'm towering over you.

07:25.291 --> 07:28.210
♪ Will you remember
the famous men ♪

07:28.210 --> 07:30.796

07:30.796 --> 07:32.089

07:36.414 --> 07:37.415
She's so cute.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.834
Yeah.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.628
How long has she
been crying?

07:41.628 --> 07:42.796
Her whole life.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.839
I got a brother
like that.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.801
You want to hold her?
No.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.928
Scared?
Yeah.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.806
Smart. Okay, shh...

07:52.806 --> 07:55.100
Sorry I wasn't there
when she was born.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.142
Oh, you weren't?

07:56.142 --> 07:58.019
No, they forgot me
at school.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.479
I had to walk home.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.980
Ooh...

08:00.980 --> 08:02.357
Oops.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.109
Then my dad got mad at me,
like I was the one

08:04.109 --> 08:05.193
who did something wrong.
Uh-huh.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.319
How is it that color?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.445
She only eats milk.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.655
And Mom hasn't been home,

08:08.655 --> 08:09.906
and I know something's going on,

08:09.906 --> 08:11.157
but no one
will tell me anything.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.784
Uh, can you hand me the powder?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.661
Do you know
what's going on with them?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.955
Huh?
With my mom and dad.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.083
Missy, it feels
like someone

08:20.083 --> 08:21.251
just drove a truck
through my body,

08:21.251 --> 08:22.585
I haven't slept
in days.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.962
I cannot help you
right now.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.047
Sorry.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.635
Son of a bitch.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.387
Pigs in a blanket?
Yeah.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.847
They're burnt.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.223
Yeah.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.516
Mom doesn't cook
them that long.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.976
Thank you.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.019
Would you teach me
how to throw a football?

08:40.019 --> 08:43.189
What? What? Why?

08:43.189 --> 08:46.359
I'm trying to get more
comfortable with failure.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.862
What makes you think
you're gonna fail?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.405
The word "ball."

08:50.405 --> 08:52.240
Well, I got to warn you,

08:52.240 --> 08:53.825
learning to throw
isn't something you get right

08:53.825 --> 08:56.578
on the first try.
It... it takes practice.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.497
And does this practice involve
setbacks and frustration?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.749
Yeah.
Perfect.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.335
Now, you'll notice that
the shape of this thing

09:04.335 --> 09:05.920
is more like
a missile, right,

09:05.920 --> 09:07.380
than it is your
typical bouncy ball.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.966
The term you're looking for
is prolate spheroid.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.594
Wasn't looking for it,
but thank you.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.262
Now, what do you think

09:14.262 --> 09:16.222
is the most efficient way
to get this thing to fly?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.473
Gyroscopic torque.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.851
Spiral.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.186
Bingo.
All right,

09:21.186 --> 09:23.605
now get your fingers
on the laces here.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.274
Why is the surface
all bumpy?

09:26.274 --> 09:27.984
Used to be made
out of pig bladder.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.404
Well... not anymore. It's...

09:33.198 --> 09:34.866
Helps with the grip. Okay?

09:34.866 --> 09:37.368
Now, fingers back on it,
and get your thumb

09:37.368 --> 09:38.912
wrapped around...
There you go.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.538
All right,
bring your other hand up.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.540
That helps keep her steady.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.958
Bring the ball
back to your ear.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.461
And when you're
ready to throw,

09:46.461 --> 09:48.504
bring your arm down
like a tomahawk.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.965
Get that ball spinning.
All right?

09:53.801 --> 09:56.346
And am I correct in assuming
that more revolutions

09:56.346 --> 09:59.641
will create a parabolic arc
that resists external forces?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.267
Sure.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.061
All right,
whenever you're ready,

10:03.061 --> 10:04.395
let's see if you
can reach me.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.023
Let the setbacks
and frustration begin.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.570
Good Lord.
That was incredible.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.073
Yeah, I saw it.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.033
Where you going?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.827
To hit the showers.
Apparently I'm a jock now.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.209
I got the baby to
settle down. Easy peasy.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.419
Take it down a notch, Nana.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.838
I will try,
but I don't know if I can.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.632
Georgie on the couch?

10:32.632 --> 10:33.925
Mm-hmm.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.471
And what exactly is it
that's wrong with your bed?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.098
My husband's in it.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.517
So, you're just gonna
keep sleeping here

10:42.517 --> 10:43.851
instead of dealing
with it?

10:43.851 --> 10:45.853
I'm helping
with the baby.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.898
She'll still be crying
tomorrow. Go home.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.441
I will.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.986
I just need
my space right now.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.862
I know the feeling.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.449
You're cranky.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.618
You want me
to rock you to sleep?

11:00.618 --> 11:01.661
I'm pretty good
at it.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.871
Don't touch me.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.753
Did you ever find out

11:10.753 --> 11:12.297
where your mom was
the other day?

11:12.297 --> 11:14.090
She was at the hospital

11:14.090 --> 11:15.675
for your brother's baby.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.176
What?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.220
Did you not know
he had one?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.139
It's a girl. Shh.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.224
No talking during the test.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.105
Your mom was there?
Yeah.

11:29.105 --> 11:32.734
So I was the only person in the
whole world who wasn't there.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.485
Keep your eyes
on your own papers.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.820
I'm not cheating.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.572
Well, that's not
what it looks like.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.408
I guess you would know
what cheating looks like.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.201
Ask your husband.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.621
What has gotten
into you?

11:45.621 --> 11:47.498
Well?
Answer your mother.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.709
So the only time you two talk
to each other is to yell at me?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.836
That is not true.
Oh, really?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.671
Where have you been sleeping
the last couple nights?

11:53.671 --> 11:56.132
Whoa, you do not talk
to us that way.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.302
And you do not talk
to your teacher that way either.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.304
Sheldon says obnoxious
things all the time,

12:01.304 --> 12:02.847
but it's fine
'cause he's special.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.724
This is not
about Sheldon.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.309
For once. Oh.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.145
We forgot to pick you up
one time. Cut the drama.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.523
One time? You've been
forgetting me my entire life.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.859
Everything is Sheldon,
and now Georgie has a baby,

12:14.859 --> 12:16.611
and you two are fighting.

12:16.611 --> 12:17.862
Might as well
be invisible.

13:19.735 --> 13:21.404
Of course.

13:21.404 --> 13:23.531
Let me just drop everything
so I can be of assistance.

13:23.531 --> 13:24.574
Thank you.

13:27.493 --> 13:29.162
I'm trying
to embrace failure,

13:29.162 --> 13:30.997
and I realized that
social subtleties

13:30.997 --> 13:32.999
like sarcasm
can sometimes evade me.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.000
You don't say.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.168
No, it's true.

13:35.168 --> 13:36.961
And I was hoping
you could pepper

13:36.961 --> 13:39.755

13:39.755 --> 13:41.382
Oh, boy, when do we start?

13:41.382 --> 13:42.884
Now would be great.

13:42.884 --> 13:44.886
Sheldon, that was sarcasm.

13:44.886 --> 13:46.679
Oh, let me try again.

13:46.679 --> 13:48.181
Is this about your database?

13:48.181 --> 13:49.682
Yes.

13:49.682 --> 13:51.976
You know, I was also working
on a database

13:51.976 --> 13:54.395
that I thought would be
more successful than yours.

13:54.395 --> 13:55.771
Sarcasm?

13:55.771 --> 13:56.898
No.

13:56.898 --> 13:58.107
Oh, darn it.

13:58.107 --> 13:59.358
Wait, was the "no" sarcasm?

13:59.358 --> 14:00.902
No.
Are you sure?

14:00.902 --> 14:02.528
Yes.
Ugh,

14:02.528 --> 14:04.614
I'll never be comfortable
with failure.

14:04.614 --> 14:07.158
My point is, I was experiencing
something similar,

14:07.158 --> 14:09.243
and there's no shortcut
through grief.

14:09.243 --> 14:10.745
Those are wise words.

14:10.745 --> 14:12.038
Thank you.

14:12.038 --> 14:13.706
It was smart I came to you.

14:13.706 --> 14:16.250
You're clearly an expert
on humiliation and defeat.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.752
Sarcasm?

14:17.752 --> 14:19.295
No.
Leave.

14:19.295 --> 14:21.214
Sarcasm?
No.

14:21.214 --> 14:23.341
Bye.

14:24.717 --> 14:26.302
Go to your room. Fine.

14:26.302 --> 14:28.638
And you're gonna apologize
to Mrs. Wilkins.

14:28.638 --> 14:30.723
That's not her name anymore.

14:32.808 --> 14:34.477
Can you believe her?

14:34.477 --> 14:36.020
Well, maybe this wouldn't have
happened if you were around.

14:36.020 --> 14:39.023
Are you really trying
to blame this on me?

14:39.023 --> 14:41.234
I'm not the one
sleeping across the street.

14:41.234 --> 14:42.944
I'm here with our kids.

14:46.155 --> 14:49.158
So you want to get into this?
Let's get into this.

14:49.158 --> 14:51.327
What is going on
with you and Brenda?

14:51.327 --> 14:53.955
Nothing.
It doesn't seem like it.

14:55.122 --> 14:57.083
What, you're honestly saying
that you don't light up

14:57.083 --> 14:59.168
every time Pastor Rob's around?

15:02.964 --> 15:04.840
Maybe I do.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.760
Nothing ever happened.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.053
I wouldn't do that.

15:09.053 --> 15:10.680
What,
you saying I would?

15:10.680 --> 15:13.057
You tell me.
I wouldn't.

15:13.057 --> 15:15.059
But you like being around her.

15:33.911 --> 15:36.539
What happens now?

15:38.624 --> 15:40.501
I don't know.

15:49.176 --> 15:50.303
Hey.

15:50.303 --> 15:52.013
Hi.

15:52.013 --> 15:54.348
What are you doing here?
Where's the baby?

15:54.348 --> 15:56.809
She's fine. She's with Connie.

15:56.809 --> 15:59.395
I just needed a couple minutes.

15:59.395 --> 16:01.439
Which was...

16:01.439 --> 16:03.482
a couple hours ago.

16:03.482 --> 16:06.027
I'll go check on her,
unless you want to.

16:06.027 --> 16:08.237
Actually...

16:08.237 --> 16:09.947
I don't know what I want.

16:09.947 --> 16:11.407
What does that mean?

16:11.407 --> 16:13.784
My daughter hates me.

16:13.784 --> 16:16.329
What difference does it make
if I'm there or not?

16:16.329 --> 16:18.497
You know that ain't true.
Really?

16:18.497 --> 16:20.583
Because all she does is cry,

16:20.583 --> 16:22.585
and I'm tired all the time,

16:22.585 --> 16:25.713
and even your brother is better
at soothing her than I am.

16:26.839 --> 16:29.759
You're just a little
overwhelmed. It's normal.

16:29.759 --> 16:31.844
Why aren't you?

16:31.844 --> 16:33.721
Well, we can't both be
freaked out at the same time.

16:33.721 --> 16:35.389
We got to
take turns.

16:35.389 --> 16:36.932
When's your turn?

16:36.932 --> 16:38.684
Already had it.

16:38.684 --> 16:40.561
I was so scared
when I got to

16:40.561 --> 16:42.521
the hospital, I...

16:42.521 --> 16:45.191
I got back in my car
and drove away.

16:45.191 --> 16:47.360
While I was in labor?!

16:47.360 --> 16:49.570
Don't hit me.
We're sharing freak-outs.

16:50.613 --> 16:52.740
And I still came back.

16:53.741 --> 16:55.451
What kind of parents
are we?

16:55.451 --> 16:57.078
The new kind,

16:57.078 --> 16:59.747
the well-meaning,
dumb kind.

16:59.747 --> 17:01.457
We're gonna get better, right?

17:01.457 --> 17:04.001
We ain't got no choice.

17:06.045 --> 17:08.714
I'll let you sleep.
I'm gonna go check on CeeCee.

17:08.714 --> 17:11.175
Thank you.

17:15.554 --> 17:17.181
What are you smiling at?

17:17.181 --> 17:18.766
Just thinking.

17:18.766 --> 17:21.060
We might've conceived CeeCee
in this very garage.

17:21.060 --> 17:22.645
Okay, you're gross. Leave now.

17:22.645 --> 17:24.897
Bye.

17:32.113 --> 17:33.114
What are you doing?

17:33.114 --> 17:35.449
Oh, um...

17:35.449 --> 17:38.994
I'm just gonna be staying
at Meemaw's a little bit longer.

17:40.204 --> 17:41.247
Okay.

17:41.247 --> 17:43.290
You all right?

17:43.290 --> 17:45.167
No.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.586
What's going on?

17:47.586 --> 17:50.714
My database...

17:50.714 --> 17:53.717
I've-I've never failed
like this before,

17:53.717 --> 17:55.553
and it frightens me.

17:57.221 --> 17:59.348
Oh... sweetie,

17:59.348 --> 18:01.767
I'm sorry. Sometimes,

18:01.767 --> 18:04.103
no matter how much
we want things to work out,

18:04.103 --> 18:06.230
they just don't.

18:31.380 --> 18:34.258
Dealing with failure
is a tricky business.

18:34.258 --> 18:37.344
You can face it head on
and try to overcome it.

18:40.556 --> 18:42.266
Good job, Mama.

18:43.726 --> 18:45.186
You can avoid it.

18:45.186 --> 18:47.521
Thanks for
letting me stay.

18:47.521 --> 18:50.357
For as long
as you need.

18:50.357 --> 18:52.485
You can try to drown it out.

18:55.779 --> 18:58.199
Or you can try to talk
to someone about it.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.580
And some people choose to run.
