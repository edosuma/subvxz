02:11.097 --> 02:15.864
Have you ever loved? lf so you'll
understand what cinema has told us.

02:16.035 --> 02:19.527
All the happy ending
tales of love are a lie!

02:20.206 --> 02:22.003
ln life there is no happy endings.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.004
A hero walking towards sunset
holding hand of heroine in slow motion.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.682
Which you'll find only in a cinema.

02:30.850 --> 02:34.411
ln real life what you see
is people like me.

02:41.060 --> 02:46.020
Now l'll tell my story. The story
of hundred days in my life.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.862
My 100 days of love.

02:49.802 --> 02:53.704
The story is not starting
from here, this is climax.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.103
The 100th day in this story.
Lets go to day one.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.513
That day was also like today.

03:43.122 --> 03:47.957
l'm BKN, don't think this is my
name. That's not our topic.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.116
One topic is this girl. Pia Menon.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.175
Rather than saying my ex girl friend...

04:14.354 --> 04:17.118
...its more correct to
say l'm her ex boy friend.

04:48.721 --> 04:53.658
This is not alcohol, this is
the 'fevicol' for heart break.

05:11.044 --> 05:11.874
Pia!

05:12.045 --> 05:14.070
There was something
between us earlier.

05:14.247 --> 05:18.343
But all those things have ended. ls
it my fault that you became a loser?

05:21.054 --> 05:22.578
ls this the balance ofthe bad words
that you showered previously?

05:22.689 --> 05:25.681
Still you are thinking only about me,
which only you need to know, is it?

05:25.792 --> 05:27.953
Why are you making it public?

05:31.764 --> 05:35.131
What are you saying that l did?
lf you want to be ashamed, carry on.

05:35.301 --> 05:37.269
But don't involve me into that one.

05:39.038 --> 05:43.134
From now on don't come to my life.
l don't want to hear anything about you.

06:22.749 --> 06:29.245
Now l'm viral, in total 638 comments.
ln all the abuses l'm being tagged.

06:29.455 --> 06:32.754
For publically scolding ex girl
friend who has left after dumping.

06:32.892 --> 06:37.329
ln 9 countries and more languages
it is being put on trend presently.

06:50.309 --> 06:57.772
Alcohol not only for health, at certain
times it is injurious to respect also.

07:09.429 --> 07:15.390
l'm sorry, to save you l tried my best.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.327
But that editor is
really adamant to the core.

07:18.471 --> 07:23.033
To tell the truth, l had to
set ready the termination letter.

07:26.512 --> 07:31.142
There is no reason for you to be
upset. Just think we don't deserve you.

07:31.250 --> 07:35.380
Tomorrow morning come to
the office and clearyour desk.

07:40.526 --> 07:44.428
Till a week before, l was a smart
feature writer at The Times.

07:45.031 --> 07:49.525
Certain creative differences with the
editor. He felt, l'm bit out spoken.

07:50.203 --> 07:53.036
A small argument and
followed by that a suspension.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.897
Within a week time, look,
now there is termination.

07:56.275 --> 07:59.301
Everything is cheap politics.

08:06.018 --> 08:11.012
This is the turning point ofthe story.
Ladies and gentle men, boys and girls.

08:11.824 --> 08:18.753
ln the mist ofthis city lights, in this
rain my life is going to change forever.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.416
That smile of hers.

08:43.289 --> 08:47.282
All the sorrows on that
day vanished in that smile.

09:07.346 --> 09:10.144
Everyone will have a
life changing moment.

09:10.516 --> 09:13.110
My life changing moment was her!

09:42.582 --> 09:45.642
One bag, one camera,
one adventure.

09:46.619 --> 09:49.986
Biggest adventure in
my life was starting from there.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.580
As usual along with
my best friend Ummer.

09:58.230 --> 10:03.099
What was left behind me
was one AK 47 and a grenade.

10:03.235 --> 10:06.295
And then?
On my left hand corner, behind the tree.

10:06.472 --> 10:09.464
There was an enemy soldier.
l knew that.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.575
After killing him only,
l can take his weapons.

10:13.679 --> 10:17.410
But l can't move from that trench.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.677
He and me into a cat mouse game!

10:23.322 --> 10:27.986
For his assistance a big tank comes,
from it ten soldiers drives outjumping.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.925
l throw the bomb, four people dead!

10:31.397 --> 10:34.457
With the AK 47 with me l fire at the
rest of the men inside the trench.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.092
My health is declined.
Only two people are left out.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.500
With two bullets!

10:39.405 --> 10:42.374
My aim did not go
wrong, both hit the target.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.008
But!
What?

10:44.176 --> 10:48.943
When l looked back, the
soldier behind the tree, gun fire!

10:57.757 --> 11:03.696
Between the life and death,
only seconds left must be careful.

11:10.469 --> 11:13.199
Level 14, there is no chance
that you reaching there.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.533
Anyway play and see.

11:15.741 --> 11:20.576
This is the life of Ummer. For those
who believe life is between Sofa and TV.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.578
For them, a video game rental
store which is run by Ummer.

11:22.748 --> 11:25.148
Ummer's Pad.
U Pad.

11:25.418 --> 11:29.479
His biggest passion is to do the
gaming by sitting here for whole day.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.451
Our U Pad is finished is it not?

11:33.059 --> 11:35.721
Do you have only me as your client?
Hey man, man!

11:36.062 --> 11:39.361
lfyou play more,
l'll finish you, go home man.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.368
Bhai, do you have cheat code?
This is the problem with your generation.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.304
Can't struggle, try to win
with a struggle.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.208
A real gamer will never
use the cheat code.

11:51.477 --> 11:54.275
Again if you come to my
store asking for cheat codes.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.762
Ha! ls Face Book celebrity sitting
here by closing the door?.

12:20.339 --> 12:25.106
Son, this l'll upload it
on Face Book and Twitter.

12:26.112 --> 12:29.104
Bad! You could have thought
about my image at least.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.615
How will l show up my face
outside telling you are my friend?

12:32.284 --> 12:35.151
Too bad even the Zuckerberg,
might have read your comments.

12:35.788 --> 12:39.246
Being your friend l also got lot of
verbally abusing messages.

12:40.192 --> 12:43.684
Hey fellow! Has he gone mad
on hearing the bad words?

12:44.130 --> 12:45.392
Hey fellow!

12:47.399 --> 12:50.527
Ummer!
My god, what is next, fellow?

12:50.703 --> 12:52.534
Today l saw her, man.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.301
The one!
What one?

12:59.478 --> 13:00.672
Yea, there is camera is it?

13:00.813 --> 13:04.840
Now we can take some photos
and upload love failure albums.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.115
How is it?

13:09.555 --> 13:11.750
The incident happened
today evening.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.285
She got inside the same
taxi that l waved to stop.

13:15.694 --> 13:19.221
While getting inside this
camera fell down from her hands.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.594
The vehicle went to somewhere.

13:25.104 --> 13:29.438
But Ummachi, that smile
of hers, man.

13:35.848 --> 13:39.215
The one!
Again, what a pity!

13:39.518 --> 13:43.284
Your grudge to the race
offemales, is it only this much?

13:43.722 --> 13:46.350
The one is not yet over,
then comes the next one.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.254
l've brought the food,
ifyou want come and eat.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.722
Otherwise no need, you sit
here holding this, l'll go and eat.

13:58.938 --> 14:02.897
You just try to remember,
daily we are seeing lot of girls.

14:03.409 --> 14:06.867
Does everyone attract us?
How many we will notice?

14:07.346 --> 14:09.906
When l eat food
l don't notice anything.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.377
Do not disturb, please.

14:12.585 --> 14:17.852
Now a crowd, among the hundreds of
people we are catching only two eyes.

14:19.225 --> 14:23.218
That very moment.
Everyone had such a thing.

14:23.395 --> 14:26.694
ls it correct?
Yea, its correct. Really correct.

14:26.832 --> 14:28.231
But once that moment is over.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.630
They will drop their eyes
and they'll go their way.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.374
Don't know, this is not like that.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.411
A kind of gut feeling.

14:40.279 --> 14:45.182
That smile of hers, a feeling, again
somewhere that smile is to be seen.

14:46.986 --> 14:50.217
lts a good feeling to
go afterthese kind of dreams.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.853
Ummer, don't you have
these kind of dreams?

14:52.958 --> 14:57.918
Why not? Must develop a game
that will shock the entire world.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.789
All the game lovers
should be chilled!

15:00.966 --> 15:04.333
Again with super models
and infinite amount of dollars.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.438
Must travel throughout this world.

15:06.972 --> 15:10.339
There is no point in talking to you.
ln your mind there is only guns.

15:10.476 --> 15:13.172
There are no roses.
Rose?

15:14.280 --> 15:17.772
Go and sleep man, he
and his gun and crap!

15:23.389 --> 15:26.654
Ummachi, why not we go
in search of her?.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.757
This is all like playing a game, no?

15:31.463 --> 15:33.727
Hey fellow!

15:47.513 --> 15:49.981
What did you say man?
Like playing a game?

15:52.584 --> 15:56.020
This is received from that bag of
the camera. They are negatives.

15:57.056 --> 15:58.683
l didn't check the bag properly.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.553
What you said is true,
its like playing a game.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.991
This film roll is the clue which
we have. The clue in the hand.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.322
The brain in the head,
if both are used properly.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.593
Can easily complete any level.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.995
Why don't we develop this film?

16:15.441 --> 16:19.605
No, that is all a cheap thing is it?
What will she think?

16:19.778 --> 16:21.837
She is not your aunty's
daughter is it?

16:22.014 --> 16:25.279
But still no need of that.
Then no need, go man.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.386
He and his camera, what over
here people have not seen camera?

16:33.659 --> 16:35.286
Ummer!
What is it man?

16:35.461 --> 16:37.554
Why don't we develop that photos?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.631
That is all very cheap
thing, what will she think?

16:40.733 --> 16:43.998
What will she think? She is
not my aunty's daughter, is it?

16:45.904 --> 16:48.771
Like that we decided
to develop that film roll.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.409
Saying as per Ummer's
language, level one.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.011
Do you know what this one is?
Camera.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.713
This is a work of art, this is a
SLR camera, during the 80's.

17:05.424 --> 17:08.415
Like today, during those times
everyone could not do photography.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.390
lts a film roll where only
12 photos can be taken.

17:11.563 --> 17:14.999
Once it is taken, that is it
can't be deleted or replaced.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.696
During the era of
lnstagram and selfies.

17:17.935 --> 17:19.836
lf she has got a camera like this.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.905
That means she has got
something to tell us.

17:22.340 --> 17:25.105
Behind each ofthe photos
in this, there will be a story.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.638
Why don't we go in
search of that story.

17:27.945 --> 17:30.779
Not that, during this age when
there is camera even inside a pen.

17:30.983 --> 17:34.441
Hats offto her for carrying
an old camera like this.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.381
By the way, have you
seen any grandmothers?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.382
Get inside the vehicle.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.491
Here, will go home and check.

17:47.966 --> 17:52.096
lts a film roll where 12 photos
can be taken, has taken only 7.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.435
This two are gone, did you
see its blurred.

17:59.144 --> 18:01.908
And the rest is five in the hand.

18:06.118 --> 18:10.111
Dasa, which is this jerk, man?

18:13.859 --> 18:16.453
Yea, good, has got a
villain's photo in the first place.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.960
Anyway your one is there
and then one jerk, is there.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.862
And lot of places which
we do not know.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.071
What is the specialty
ofthese places?

18:28.740 --> 18:31.402
lf it were the ordinary tourist spots
could have understood better.

18:31.577 --> 18:34.512
When you told initially, l thought
its your usual romantic notion.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.511
Now it looks all though its true.

18:36.648 --> 18:39.640
There is some sort of connection
between these photos and places.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.550
At first we'll find out these places.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.850
All your adventure spirit, why don't
you limit that only on gaming?

18:52.197 --> 18:54.529
Why not we have an adventure
in this boring life of ours?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.094
What ifthis is an augury?

18:57.436 --> 18:59.097
Like the dialogue
in our 'Casablanca'

19:05.611 --> 19:09.172
Of all the towns in this world.
ln the mist of all taxi.

19:09.548 --> 19:13.484
She came and got into yourtaxi.
Can it be an augury?

19:15.454 --> 19:16.921
Okay, agreed.

19:17.923 --> 19:21.859
Finding out the places in this photos.
After that, we reach to her.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.685
And then?
Then you people fall in love.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.122
Exchange the hearts.

19:27.566 --> 19:33.471
As ifto envy others, you'll sing
and dance throughout this city.

19:59.097 --> 20:06.731
''You are seen only in the dreams
without fading, eyes safe guards it''

20:06.872 --> 20:14.745
''Foreverwill open the doors
ofthe heart for you, always''

20:15.280 --> 20:23.244
''Like a whiff, on some day
you came in front of me''

20:23.555 --> 20:31.087
''Why did you vanish
foreverto somewhere?''

20:35.067 --> 20:41.199
''Always the music danced
within me, searched only for you''

21:03.028 --> 21:14.906
''Overthe ears l'll pass it on to you
certain dear things very silently...''

21:15.007 --> 21:18.135
''...from now on''

21:18.343 --> 21:26.614
''As the blue skies spills
offto the shore''

21:26.885 --> 21:34.690
''Shall adore you with
anklets that fizzles''

21:35.327 --> 21:42.733
''All though covered by clouds
swings on the silence''

21:43.268 --> 21:50.606
''Lovely star l search for you
within the bud ofthe heart''

21:50.909 --> 21:58.213
''lfyou weren't in the dream
l would have been lonely''

21:58.950 --> 22:06.982
''During the times when
you come, l become a spring''

22:11.063 --> 22:17.195
''Always the music danced within
me, searched only for you''

22:48.767 --> 22:51.235
This is the sub editor of
Times at Bangalore branch.

22:51.436 --> 22:55.770
Marry Mariyam Mathew. Mid
30's hails from Pala a Christian.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.898
The only well wisher
of mine in this office.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.847
Yea, have you reached? Come, sit.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.715
There is no reason
for you to be off, like this.

23:09.921 --> 23:13.914
The world is not limited to this office,
no? You really have got lot of skills.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.420
Everything will be fine.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.424
Forthe last 20 to 25 years,
parents say the same thing.

23:19.831 --> 23:23.733
The only difference, why fellow
are you not becoming settled?

23:25.103 --> 23:28.834
Why don't you call? After all
they are your parents, aren't they?

23:29.141 --> 23:31.939
Then shall l leave?
l'm not boring you, sitting here.

23:43.789 --> 23:46.781
As l'm chucked out, he'll be
made permanent is it not?

23:46.992 --> 23:48.186
That itching worm!

23:48.393 --> 23:51.191
More than making him permanent,
as you were fired from job.

23:51.329 --> 23:54.298
ln that happiness distributed
sweets to everyone in the morning.

23:54.466 --> 23:56.957
Anyway don't be a prey
to his eyes, he is waiting.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.434
Why man are you going
without meeting me? Sweety!

24:34.573 --> 24:36.234
He is my enemy numbertwo.

24:36.374 --> 24:38.001
Romanch(Goosebumps) Ramakrishnan.

24:38.076 --> 24:42.479
Or else itching worm! After irritating
me at school and college.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.975
We both jointly got appointed
forjob over here.

24:45.083 --> 24:48.382
After 6 months of probation period.
The one who is smarter among us.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.351
Will be made permanent that
was the management's condition.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.390
You don't have any otherjob
after going is it? You come here.

24:53.558 --> 24:55.822
Ha! Come.

24:57.462 --> 25:01.262
You and l know very well, there
should be only me in this company.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.866
Then right from olden times,
your fate is to fail before me.

25:05.070 --> 25:09.404
Hey that is not your problem man,
god has designed some people like that.

25:09.808 --> 25:10.797
Come.

25:11.409 --> 25:15.869
Because ofthis you have an
advantage, ask what is that? Ask man.

25:16.381 --> 25:18.975
Two months ofyours
didn't get wasted, no?

25:19.618 --> 25:21.984
Not yet finished saying, come.

25:24.089 --> 25:28.048
To share your sorrows, you
have got only me is it?

25:28.226 --> 25:30.888
To share my happiness,
l've got you, is it not?

25:31.496 --> 25:34.021
This happiness of mine
which is very popular.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.565
After sharing with others,
this is the balance of it.

25:36.902 --> 25:41.066
You take this. Don't stand,
lot more to say. Come, come.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.871
What is this as if
without any affection? Come.

25:44.009 --> 25:45.306
Sit.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.276
We can sit and talk something.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.984
l've made this 6 months back.

26:00.158 --> 26:02.319
Will see you at the
coffee shop at evening.

26:04.596 --> 26:09.295
Ha! Sit, one minute.
Can you leave empty handed?

26:17.409 --> 26:21.311
ln an expensive city like Bangalore.
That too without a job.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.071
ln the mist oftraffic lights.
l can't see you begging for food.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.480
Man, l can't see that
sitting in my AC car.

26:26.685 --> 26:30.621
Each time for Rs. 50
you can eat tummy full.

26:30.956 --> 26:33.186
Once this is finished,
you come and see me, okay.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.293
Again l'll give, here.

26:50.208 --> 26:50.936
What is this?

26:51.076 --> 26:53.271
Haven't you told this is
like playing a game?

26:53.411 --> 26:56.175
Forthat should not be idle
like this, should play in full spirit.

26:57.582 --> 26:59.311
You forget about the
rest ofthe two photos.

27:00.151 --> 27:03.052
Only these two photos
are sufficient for us to find her.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.483
The chance is this
must be a college lab.

27:05.657 --> 27:08.649
And this one a cinema theater,
both must be in this city only.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.329
This is easy to find
both ofthese, no?

27:12.130 --> 27:14.155
But forthat there are lot
oftheaters in this city.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.891
Hey fool, do you see only her?

27:17.102 --> 27:19.002
Behind her, look close.

27:20.238 --> 27:23.605
That is the poster of an
old Kannada movie of Raj Kumar.

27:24.075 --> 27:24.598
That is correct.

27:24.743 --> 27:27.405
Man, how many theaters will be
there showing the movies of Raj Kumar?

28:35.547 --> 28:38.209
We found out that
lab and that theater.

28:42.587 --> 28:45.249
Come man.
Are you Malayalees?

28:46.324 --> 28:47.689
Yes.
Do you know?

28:47.826 --> 28:49.350
Let me see that photo.

28:51.196 --> 28:54.029
Will you give this photo to me?
For what?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.563
After all she is a girl who
has come here, no?

28:55.734 --> 28:57.793
Let this be with me, for
memories. Children!

28:58.236 --> 29:00.602
What a wish of an old man?

29:02.607 --> 29:05.201
Are you all an old man?

29:07.512 --> 29:08.774
Yours...

29:43.214 --> 29:45.682
Brother, take this.

Thanks brother.

29:53.158 --> 29:56.059

30:03.601 --> 30:06.195
But our luck ended there.

30:11.576 --> 30:17.139
Look, as we got inside the college,
missing our college days is it not?

30:17.916 --> 30:19.850
l don't miss that much.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.850
Do you remember that
day when we first met?

30:24.889 --> 30:29.121
Even if forgets own father and
mother, l won't forget that day.

30:44.709 --> 30:47.507
Hey fellow, stand straight.

31:07.432 --> 31:10.162

31:58.449 --> 32:00.349
Tell the name you fat guy.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.786

32:11.729 --> 32:14.789

32:14.999 --> 32:16.933
Move back l say.

32:24.242 --> 32:26.210

32:27.512 --> 32:29.412
Asking whats your name?

32:32.583 --> 32:36.485
B.K.N
Are you any literary person?

32:37.488 --> 32:39.353
Fellow, tell your full name.

32:40.358 --> 32:42.485
Balan K Nair.

32:46.597 --> 32:48.224
What?

32:51.602 --> 32:57.563
What is this man? ls it Udaya studio?
Has the old villains joined together?

33:10.088 --> 33:11.851
Okay start.
What?

33:29.407 --> 33:30.897
My shirt!

33:34.612 --> 33:35.442
Torn.

33:38.383 --> 33:39.645
Leave it Ummer.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.387
Just think everything
happened in a weak moment.

33:47.992 --> 33:51.723
Looks like our parents have
not seen old Malayalam movies.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.466
l should blame my grandfather.

33:57.602 --> 34:00.662
Before l was born,
a month back he died.

34:01.406 --> 34:05.342
As motherwas shocked.
She had put his name to me.

34:05.510 --> 34:09.105
Along with father's name and name
of the caste, that became Balan K Nair.

34:27.799 --> 34:31.063
Hey fellow, aren't you watching
the game? lndia will fail again.

34:31.369 --> 34:34.360
Which game?
Why asking which game?

34:35.505 --> 34:37.667
What are you scribbling?

34:46.016 --> 34:47.813
lsn't this our Obama?

34:50.987 --> 34:52.956
Your crazy madness of
drawing did it start again?

34:53.091 --> 34:55.650
This is not like the old
one, this is a comic strip.

34:57.995 --> 35:00.759
ln this there will be international
as well as lndian politics.

35:01.866 --> 35:06.030
Barack Obama is the hero. Anyway
there is no otherjob, isn't it?

35:06.404 --> 35:08.497
You play video games and l draw.

35:12.176 --> 35:15.668
Then what? An international artist.

35:17.982 --> 35:22.885
People are struck in the level two.
At that time Barack Obama.

35:23.554 --> 35:27.081
Ummachi..l don't think
all this will work out.

35:28.426 --> 35:31.054
Bangalore, is a city
where lakhs of people live.

35:31.229 --> 35:34.562
We are the fools to search for
a girl, with two or three photos.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.792
What is the surety
that she is in this city?

35:37.902 --> 35:40.166
Hey fellow, a game is
never stopped in between.

35:40.438 --> 35:43.464
We fail in a game, when
we don't use the clues.

35:43.574 --> 35:47.738
What we've with us is living photos.
What if she is girl friend of someone?

35:50.515 --> 35:52.881
Minimum must be
the sister of someone.

35:53.017 --> 35:55.417
Whatever be the scenario
in this, its not good for us.

35:55.953 --> 35:59.184
Even if she is found
out, what will l say to her?

36:01.492 --> 36:04.154
Hey, we once had seen
on a rainy night.

36:04.562 --> 36:06.996
You had gone in a taxi
which l showed the hand.

36:07.231 --> 36:09.756
On that day, l got your
camera which was lost.

36:10.101 --> 36:16.040
l've developed all the photos in it.
With that l traced you and found you.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.235
As the things have reached
this far, why don't we love?

36:21.546 --> 36:24.174
Good, marvelous.

36:24.715 --> 36:29.516
So, this is how you talk to girls, is it?
No doubt why that girl dumped you.

36:32.290 --> 36:37.956
First of all we'll find her. Then l'll tell
what to say, how to say and all.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.926
This is what fellow, l say once
in a while must play a game.

36:41.098 --> 36:44.158
Step by step, that is
the procedure of that.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.265
On the matter of games
or on the matter of girls.

36:50.107 --> 36:52.132
That is true, on the matter of girls...

36:52.310 --> 36:56.076
...our Ummer, who is virgin is the
last word in this Bangalore city.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.209
While delegated with a task.

37:02.286 --> 37:05.517
Anyone will be startled, on
seeing Ummer's dedication.

37:05.623 --> 37:06.521
The itching worm!

37:13.030 --> 37:14.930
Simply a dream!

37:20.938 --> 37:23.600
Why? Have you finished
all your food vouchers?

37:23.708 --> 37:24.970
l came to see you Romanch
(Goosebumps).

37:25.643 --> 37:28.840
During the times of a dire need,
only you were there to help me.

37:29.981 --> 37:33.849
lfthose food vouchers
weren't there...

37:42.660 --> 37:43.854
l'm l disturbing you?

37:44.762 --> 37:49.290
Did you see this? ln the employee
ofthe month l'm also short listed.

37:51.335 --> 37:55.863
To all those jerks who doesn't
vote for me, l was sending the spam.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.344
For the help which you
did, l came to say one thanks.

38:12.623 --> 38:18.152
ls this our Ummer?
ls he still alive?

38:21.132 --> 38:23.123
Who is this?
Will tell all that.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.168
To fail you, l've kept ready
a deadly idea.

38:27.004 --> 38:28.130
To fail me?

38:29.640 --> 38:32.302
This is a new feature,
it will be a sure shot hit.

38:32.710 --> 38:34.234
An idea which can
impress the editor.

38:34.378 --> 38:35.709
What is it?

38:35.846 --> 38:37.108
Hidden Bangalore.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.910
lts a contest which can
be started in our city supplement.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.815
We are publishing some photos
of certain places at Bangalore.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.114
Which are not famous.

38:44.322 --> 38:48.088
From those readers who identify this
correctly, we'll announce one winner.

38:48.693 --> 38:49.785
How is it?

38:52.330 --> 38:56.164
Anyway you got my job, so
let this idea also be yours.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.129
Can blurthe face ofthis person.

38:58.302 --> 39:00.202
l'll send the mail regarding
the details of places.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.705
Was this your deadly thought?
lnitially when you told. Not that.

39:03.874 --> 39:07.708
As per your lQ level this
one is beyond the limit!

39:07.878 --> 39:11.279
Doesn't matter, let me think over it.

39:12.650 --> 39:16.245
l had told the matter to sub editor.
He has liked it also.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.786
You convince the editor also.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.384
Romanch, you are the
employee of the month.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.991
So shall l take leave.
All the best.

39:29.834 --> 39:31.802
A tom fool!

39:35.873 --> 39:37.033
What a fool he is.

39:50.254 --> 39:54.816
You sit here drawing him. One day
l'll take all this and send to Obama.

39:55.459 --> 39:59.088
Obama, will give the
quotation to F.B.l, to kill you.

40:05.436 --> 40:06.903
Which is this girl?

40:11.075 --> 40:14.044
Who is this?
Let her be anyone. What is it to you?

40:14.211 --> 40:16.111
The fellow who has come to play
the game, must play the game.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.441
lsn't this that cafe which is
near our Pinky aunty's house?

40:20.184 --> 40:21.879
What did you say? PinkyAunty.

40:22.052 --> 40:24.145
Which Pinky Aunty?
Do you know the cafe?

40:25.089 --> 40:28.855
Near to our college,
the owner is a tough guy.

40:55.753 --> 40:57.345
Show it man.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.085
Have you come to drink tea?

41:02.193 --> 41:04.058
Finished drinking tea?
No.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.490
Go, go, has come
with a photo, out, out!

41:07.064 --> 41:09.498
Why is he saying like this?
Come man.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.266
Otherwise, we'll...

41:23.080 --> 41:24.308
Hey man, if she is
staying in this area.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.110
No chance that she
won't see this notice board.

41:26.250 --> 41:29.151
Why not we paste this photo's copy
along with our details, over here?

41:30.254 --> 41:32.552
lf not her, someone knowing her
might see, will that be okay?

41:33.090 --> 41:36.753
Hey smart boy at certain times
you are really a big thing, man.

41:36.894 --> 41:38.156
ls it so?
Truly.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.990
Only during certain times.

42:37.354 --> 42:42.291
Mr. Nair are you a Malayalee?
As if l've heard Malayalam.

42:42.493 --> 42:44.085
Hey fellow, says she is Malayalee.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.925
Yes, child please say.
Can you return my bag?

42:48.132 --> 42:49.827
At last has found you, is it?

42:50.334 --> 42:52.564
Can't you be little more
careful on these things?

42:52.970 --> 42:55.837
Thank you Chetta (brother).
For keeping it safe till now.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.439
lf it was received in someone else's
hand, it can be never received.

42:58.642 --> 43:02.237
That is sure, no?
Then no need to call me chetta, and all.

43:03.914 --> 43:06.439
Go man! Anyway we'll meet.

43:06.617 --> 43:09.586
To be sure of the person, can you
confirm what was inside that bag?

43:10.120 --> 43:15.285
Sure, one lip stick, one nail polish
and one packet of care free.

43:17.328 --> 43:20.354
Who are you, girl?
Not girl but a male.

43:21.365 --> 43:25.301
A male!
Hang and go man, you psycho!

43:29.406 --> 43:33.570
This unknown jerk, from now
on he'll be known as psycho!

43:34.244 --> 43:38.476
On the matter of making me mad, he
was the father of our itching worm!

43:39.950 --> 43:42.248
Chetta, will you return my thing?

43:43.120 --> 43:45.486
He has become a big nuisance.
Has he called again?

43:46.290 --> 43:51.023
He is calling from this number,
note it. 890 8911 111

43:52.663 --> 43:55.496
lf l get him in my hand, l'll kill
him by chopping. l'll also kill!

43:55.699 --> 43:57.394
He and his double..

43:58.369 --> 44:02.100
Even if she gets grand children,
Ummer won't quit from the game.

44:02.306 --> 44:05.173
Because ofthat l thought
of putting a full stop to this.

44:13.350 --> 44:14.510
Hey fellow stop it.

44:15.085 --> 44:16.382
Because of yourjumping...

44:16.587 --> 44:18.350
...earth quake will happen at Mrs.
Chopra's place at down stairs.

44:23.394 --> 44:24.952
Yea, next level.

44:31.535 --> 44:33.264
That was not required.

44:34.238 --> 44:36.138
Here it comes, jump.

44:40.177 --> 44:43.044
Ummer!
Stopped, stopped!

44:44.081 --> 44:46.379
Look at this one?

44:49.353 --> 44:50.718
Take a look!

44:51.088 --> 44:53.648
These pictures are blurred one, no?
Look closely.

44:58.595 --> 45:00.756
Hey man, this is you is it not?

45:10.074 --> 45:12.133
What if she knows you?

45:12.609 --> 45:14.577
What if it is a game by her?

45:15.713 --> 45:18.511
What if she is watching
you, by staying aloof?

45:23.087 --> 45:24.748
Hey man this is a 50-50 photo.

45:25.823 --> 45:29.259
Sometimes completely by random
l was imprinted on this somehow.

45:30.761 --> 45:34.219
Exactly at the right time, exactly
at the right place. How?

45:36.066 --> 45:38.330
Otherwise yourtheory
will be correct. l don't know.

45:38.635 --> 45:40.762
Anyway must find an answerto this.

45:41.105 --> 45:43.596
Only after finding her,
we'll get out of this.

45:43.807 --> 45:47.675
Today is Friday, never mind if
this weekend is allotted forthis.

45:48.045 --> 45:51.105
We'll find out till the
last clues in these photos.

45:52.649 --> 45:55.311
Photos!
Here.

46:04.661 --> 46:07.824
Clue!
Shut up! His last clues!

46:23.147 --> 46:24.478
Where is that phone?

46:36.693 --> 46:38.490
Your Romanchan got suspended.

46:42.199 --> 46:45.566
That flop feature of hidden
Bangalore was published in the paper.

46:45.769 --> 46:47.430
After convincing the editor. He had
written the feature in the paper.

46:47.771 --> 46:49.705
Don't know is it due to
frustration ofthat or not?

46:50.174 --> 46:52.438
There was office party being
held two days back isn't it?

46:52.810 --> 46:58.442
After having two, the complaint is he
misbehaved with Nikitha, on sports.

46:59.383 --> 47:02.079
Heard that got two slaps from her.

47:02.319 --> 47:04.753
ln the morning from the head office
the suspension Email has reached.

47:04.922 --> 47:09.757
By the by, your friend our editor
got transferred to Bombay office.

47:09.927 --> 47:13.124
Till the new editorjoins,
l'm the stand by editor.

47:15.666 --> 47:21.366
l've re- appointed you. You can
resume in your feature writer post.

47:24.374 --> 47:25.864
How can l say thank you?

47:26.243 --> 47:30.202
No need to say thanks and all when
new editorjoins, don't fight with him.

47:31.582 --> 47:35.211
And by the way where is he now?
Poor one, is clearing the desk.

47:38.622 --> 47:40.556
What was the name ofthe
girl that you told at sports?

47:40.757 --> 47:42.122
Nikitha.

47:42.392 --> 47:44.292
l'll replace this and give.

48:14.625 --> 48:16.684
Why are you going without
seeing me, sweety?

48:17.394 --> 48:19.692
You are not having
any job, do you? Come.

48:20.664 --> 48:21.756
Come on!

48:24.801 --> 48:27.668
l came to know the things
and all, never mind man.

48:28.205 --> 48:30.230
But still you received
a slap from a girl, is it?

48:30.474 --> 48:32.601
She has learned Judo.

48:33.911 --> 48:36.812
Your old cabin is my new cabin.

48:36.980 --> 48:39.642
While joining l'm putting
the name board and all.

48:41.818 --> 48:43.979
l'm sad while thinking
about your case.

48:44.655 --> 48:45.952
On learning that you were being
chucked out on a female issue.

48:46.323 --> 48:48.757
Then its very tough to get a
placement in other places. ls it?

48:50.460 --> 48:54.521
l was justjoking is it? You are
Romanch, is it? Master of all arts.

48:54.698 --> 48:57.792
Even ifyou sit at home, won't you
invent next apple and face book?

48:59.636 --> 49:01.399
Like someone has told..

49:04.274 --> 49:05.741
l was the one!

49:05.943 --> 49:08.741
Now if you have any
needs, you can call me.

49:09.446 --> 49:12.279
From next week onwards when
l come to office in company car.

49:12.582 --> 49:15.483
l can't bear to see you
begging under the traffic lights.

49:15.852 --> 49:20.312
Because ofthat for
free, food vouchers!

49:21.491 --> 49:22.515
No need.

49:28.865 --> 49:30.298
Back to routine is it?

49:30.434 --> 49:34.427
Actually missing him, as if
there is no competition.

49:35.973 --> 49:39.431
Today evening at hotel Leela,
there is a product launch event.

49:39.643 --> 49:43.477
You should cover that. l've
emailed two entry passes.

49:54.725 --> 49:56.488
What is this man?

50:11.441 --> 50:14.877
Umm..You thiefwhere is my thing?
Hang and go man.

50:15.078 --> 50:16.773
lfyou have the guts
give me your address.

50:16.913 --> 50:21.009
For what? ls it to courier it? Chetta,
that will be all trouble foryou, won't it?

50:25.422 --> 50:27.287
Hey fellow come.
What?

50:27.491 --> 50:28.890
Not what? Who? Come.

50:30.594 --> 50:31.618
Look!

50:36.733 --> 50:39.702
This is thatjerk in the photo, no?
The very same jerk.

50:39.936 --> 50:43.997
But still all these days after
searching her, haven't thought of him.

50:44.941 --> 50:46.841
What if she is in here?

50:47.978 --> 50:50.310
Search!
No, this way.

51:08.698 --> 51:10.427
Anyway she is not here.

51:12.102 --> 51:14.570
But he is the lifeline given by god.

51:15.705 --> 51:20.699
lfyou don't use this lifeline correctly,
you'll have to say bye to your one.

51:21.945 --> 51:25.403
But how to go and talk,
what if he misunderstands us?

51:25.949 --> 51:29.077
Even otherwise you don't have
the experience to handle these things.

51:29.820 --> 51:34.120
For the time being you wait here.
l'll go and talk.

51:34.925 --> 51:36.358
How many plays
had Ummer played?

51:36.460 --> 51:37.893
Please don't ruin it.

52:12.996 --> 52:14.827
Hey man, he is a Malayalee!

52:15.031 --> 52:17.829
He is not like how we
thought, he is extremely decent.

52:18.101 --> 52:21.559
He knows her and has also
told he'll help us.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.504
Why are you not convinced?

52:25.609 --> 52:28.442
Afterthe program has told that
will meet at the underground parking.

52:28.578 --> 52:30.102
You believe at that time.

52:35.719 --> 52:37.983
lts time for him to come.

52:38.455 --> 52:41.788
As seen in movies and all, some hit
men coming out from here and there.

52:42.092 --> 52:44.822
Will they whack us?
Go man.

53:53.029 --> 53:56.157
The fast super cars in the world.

53:59.970 --> 54:03.929
The price is one crore
and eighty lakhs.

54:17.120 --> 54:21.716
From the choice oftransport among
us will tell the difference between us.

54:22.692 --> 54:25.661
Behind good looking girls
hailing from good families.

54:26.129 --> 54:29.155
There will be lot of losers
like you, l know that.

54:37.007 --> 54:39.202
The girl which you
showed me, is my girl.

54:40.677 --> 54:45.171
Whatever be your intention. Over
here. Stop it, at this very moment.

54:47.050 --> 54:50.019
Don't you ever come in front of
me with that scrape vehicle.

54:50.754 --> 54:52.722
Won't reach ifyou
run along with me.

55:09.039 --> 55:13.305
lf hero lets free, there is a
common habit of going afterthem.

55:13.610 --> 55:15.202
For we villains.

55:22.819 --> 55:27.051
Your 430 BHP Malchan's
leather and all, keep it with you!

55:27.257 --> 55:30.749
But her, at the climax
she'll be with me.

55:44.174 --> 55:47.871
His kind of coming and on seeing
his car, l had quit from the game.

55:48.044 --> 55:50.604
On what ground have
you challenged him?

55:50.747 --> 55:51.873
Not by seeing anything.

55:52.115 --> 55:55.607
But aftertelling dialogue on us he
mustn't return like a hero, like that.

55:55.819 --> 55:59.016
Anyway one thing
is decided, game over.

56:01.024 --> 56:04.619
For me its not that
one, he ridiculed our vehicle.

56:05.395 --> 56:07.795
lt not that, there is nothing
in what he said.

56:07.931 --> 56:09.398
Hey man, should
have gratitude, gratitude.

56:09.766 --> 56:12.234
You have roamed all over
the world in this in search of her.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.894
You tell, has she ever cheated us?

56:18.341 --> 56:19.831
No, is it?

56:23.813 --> 56:26.782
Good tongue, come
will get down and check.

56:44.467 --> 56:47.766
Check who is it? lf its that
psycho, scold him nicely.

56:52.709 --> 56:57.772
Hallo, itching..No, Romanch.
Bala, l had met with an accident.

56:58.782 --> 57:02.309
Right now at the hospital,
can you come fast?

57:02.952 --> 57:08.322
Thinks, l don't have much time.
Can you please come?

57:10.794 --> 57:11.488
Who is it man?

57:11.995 --> 57:14.361
lts that Choriyan, he had
met with an accident.

57:14.731 --> 57:18.963
At the Sakara hospital, on hearing
seems serious, told you to come fast.

57:20.003 --> 57:22.938
May be to say, before dying
l failed and you won, Bala.

57:23.106 --> 57:25.734
But still.
l was justjoking.

57:31.414 --> 57:33.974
Come, get in we'll see
how he is lying.

57:49.899 --> 57:51.423
This is the one.

57:52.535 --> 57:53.502
Come.

57:55.805 --> 57:58.000
l want to see my mother.
Lie down without moving.

57:58.208 --> 58:00.369
Get lost you sister.
This fellow is...

58:02.345 --> 58:04.176
This will be over now.

58:10.053 --> 58:12.886
For tying a band like this have
you cried like this, as if dying?

58:13.890 --> 58:16.051
Romancha, don't l know
you right from olden days.

58:16.326 --> 58:17.350
Saying not because
of anything else.

58:17.560 --> 58:20.256
Never has seen a
timid guy like him in life.

58:20.530 --> 58:23.761
Were you hit by some cycle?
No, its a car.

58:24.934 --> 58:26.424
l was brought in that.

58:27.570 --> 58:28.901
Hey man...

58:30.440 --> 58:32.908
...something has happened.

58:34.143 --> 58:36.976
For me something
like a, lack of brains.

58:37.113 --> 58:38.944
When the vehicle had struck on
you, your brains started working man.

58:39.115 --> 58:40.446
By the way, where is that
girl who had hit on you?

58:40.583 --> 58:43.313
lts a girl, may be some
where in that corridor.

58:43.453 --> 58:46.047
On your horoscope, at present
it must be dangers due to females.

58:46.189 --> 58:47.213
Anyway l'll meet that girl and come.

58:47.557 --> 58:49.855
Let her know there
are people on your side.

58:50.293 --> 58:52.352
No, over here.

59:25.595 --> 59:28.291
Like that once again
she came into my life.

59:28.665 --> 59:30.223
Same like the first one.

59:54.290 --> 59:57.282
No need to get tensed.
Nothing has happened to him.

59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.585
Actually, for bringing him
here in this condition.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.659
l don't know how
to say thanks.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:09.596
Not that normally when an accident
occurs no one used to stop.

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:26.214
lf you want you may
go home, l'll be here only.

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:29.414
lf there is anything,
l'll let you know that.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.653
l'll call.

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:49.172
l was about to ask, we..
We've met somewhere, is it?

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.638
Usually, that is how the
boys start a conversation.

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:59.314
l was justjoking, go on what
is that, what you wanted to ask?

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:04.685
That is the same what
is to be asked.

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.659
Haven't we met
before somewhere?

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:14.035
Last month we had met near the UB
city. You had offered me the taxi.

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.234
Now got recollected.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:31.179
lts not that, some kind of a feeling.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.618
Haven't we met
before that, somewhere?

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.218
l know Balan.

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:44.088
lts a bit old memory.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:50.465
While saying old, summer of 99.

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:55.175
Dubai lnternational School.

01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:01.583
All were for the final preparations
ofthe annual examination.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:05.552
But in my mind,
there was only this plant.

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:10.455
For the science exhibition , this plant
which l cared for 3 months to grow it.

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:16.792
There was one person at the
school, who was not bothered of exams.

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:24.768
Aren't you ashamed to study after
coming to school? Hey fellow!

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.111
What is this, is this
a veg sandwich?

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:37.652
Doesn't your mummy know to
make chicken sandwich?

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:42.558
lfyou don't bring chicken sandwich
tomorrow, don't you know me?

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:44.456
Hold this.

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:49.196
Get lost girl, hey fellow are you
running and playing on the ground?

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:50.526
Get lost fellow!

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:05.409
Hey girl, where is your lunch box?

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:08.108
ln my house lunch is
made for me to eat.

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:10.283
What did you say?

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:13.549
My mother has told that
bullies like you are just losers.

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.656
What did you call me?

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.331
l'll show you, okay.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.388
Without learning dialogue,
to manage l'll tell you a trick.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:28.292
What trick?

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:30.523
This big dialogue is
the most toughest, is it?

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:33.568
On this stage of drama, l'm in
front, and Balan is behind me, no?

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:34.431
Yes.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:35.468
l'm a tree, no?

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:39.371
On pasting this paper behind me
you can see that and read, no?

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:41.338
That is correct, no?

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.412
Good.

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:54.453
Balan...good luck Balan.
Thank you.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.818
My goodness!

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:36.595
You turn!
Turn l say!

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.730
You turn!

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:42.665
Please turn, you turn please!

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:49.009
Eh? Loser!

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:05.460
Now do you remember me?
How did you recognize me?

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.559
Recently l read about a
restaurant review on Times.

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:10.461
The writers name striked me.

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:14.402
l know only two people
with the name Balan K Nair.

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.662
Just for a curiosity.
On the Times web site.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.469
On seeing in your profile Dubai
lnternational School, l was sure.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.369
Had seen the photo also.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:27.508
Actually, on that night
before we had met.

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:30.850
l had seen Balan at
a mall in random.

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:34.753
But at that time
l didn't feel like saying hi.

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:02.382
Balan you are a loser!

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:07.045
With that call l fell from
Keerikadan Jose to Kalari Achu.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:14.655
What's up man? What did she say?

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:15.864
Mother!

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:21.359
My god!

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:27.102
Allah!
Teeth!

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:31.742
That slap was pending
for years! She...ls a female!

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:38.082
Mother, l'll reach with
in half an hour.

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:43.023
lts from home. l must pick up
mother and take her for shopping.

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:46.322
Never thought we'll
ever meet again.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.898
Thanks Balan for
offering to stay here.

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:53.664
l've your numberyea,
l'll come in the morning.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.096
l've got some otherjob, it was
you who dropped him here, no?

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.100
So, you take care of him.

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.384
Sheela!

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.629
Balan K Nair and Sheela!

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:27.129
This is like saying a
young crocodile loving a stag.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:29.493
A cheap combination.

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:55.158
Hey fellow! Are you calling me
again after changing the voice?

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:58.490
What? Hey fellow?
Balan this is Sheela.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.836
Didn't you save my number?

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:16.712
You can't beat Chandu.
ln life Chandu has been out beaten.

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:20.819
Many. When love was
weighed against gold and money.

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:23.149
The loved girl also defeated me.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.187
At last!

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:26.658
At last!

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:30.693
Mind blowing performance!

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.428
To accept the failure..

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.536
Chandu life is again kept aside.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:38.807
lf that girl has busted you, what
did the poor Mammookka, do?

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:43.068
Right from morning will sit with the
laptop, looking and luring her.

01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:47.515
Come son, we will play golf.

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:56.989
ls it Ummer?.
Knows my name.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:59.491
Why not? Ummer is famous is it not?

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.893
l'm Sheela.
l know.

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:14.106
Hi.
Why are you here?

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:17.973
On calling not picking up the phone.
No reply fortext messages.

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:21.244
Then thought will
directly come and meet.

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:25.018
Still now haven't you done
with the anger towards me?

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.212
On thinking when we were
young did something...

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.581
...are you still keeping all
that in mind even now?

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.953
No there is no animosity,
this is a mood of failed lover.

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:34.857
Tomorrow is ex-girl friend's marriage.
Really.

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.567
Tomorrow for the wedding
we should also go.

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:45.899
Balan, while not going why
do you want to fail before her?

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:49.270
Myself and Ummerwill
come along for a company.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:50.805
lsn't it Ummer?
Why not.

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:54.646
But there is a problem
in that sector he is a celebrity.

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:58.684
Publically on the FB
he has verbally abused her.

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:08.121
Even otherwise the Balan
whom l knew was a tough guy.

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.797
All this is an experience is it?

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.897
Going for ex-girl friend's wedding...

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.932
...should be there in all the boys
bucket list. ls it so Ummer?.

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:17.897
lf she fires, we'll put a bomb.

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:27.007
What did you think?
l'm totally sitting in sadness.

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:32.843
Then my plan was to go tomorrow.
lts not because you came and told.

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:35.619
l don't intend to fail like that.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:38.122
Let herfind that l'm not at all in grief.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:52.897
Are you BKN chettan in Face book?
Can l take one selfie?

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.164
When l told Choriyan
is my enemy number two...

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.702
...you might have thought
who is my enemy number one?

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:26.064
Meet Mr. Rocky K Nair,
the head boy at school.

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:29.209
Foot ball team captain,
heart throb, model student.

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:33.074
Medical degree from Hayward
University. Beautiful girls as girl friends.

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:37.742
Now in his parents own
hospitals, CEO and chief surgeon.

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:39.921
Are you fine, young brother?

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.281
Thinking what am
l doing here?

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:46.287
Did you see him Mithun?
He is close friend of mine.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.255
Few years we were
together at Boston.

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:54.394
From you to him,
anyway she is intelligent.

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.408
l'm asking since l don't know.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.675
So far never a girl has dumped
me and went to other person.

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.725
Leave l say!

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:23.898
How many years it has
been since l bullied you like this?

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:25.796
Will it be 4 to 5 years back?

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:27.993
Not that, no one is
missing you at home.

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:32.797
Anyway you'll be the second best
if you want make a visit and go.

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:40.707
Must be the friend. Nice
company where everyou go...

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:43.215
...will have loserfriends like
this, who doesn't come up.

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:52.119
She is good.

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:58.294
My...
My girl friend.

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:05.368
Your girl friend?
Something wrong with her head?

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.373
Let me go and talk.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.503
Leave me fellow.

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:16.343
This idiot is saying you
are his girl friend. ls it so?

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:25.056
l'm his much better version.
His very own successful brother.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:27.492
Leave him.
Come with me.

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:36.427
Didn't tell me you've
a brother like this.

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:41.174
lf l had a brother like
this l wouldn't have told.

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:49.875
Don't we've to meet newly weds?
l should meet this ex-girl friend.

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.356
Rocky brother, is it not?
Yes.

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:58.449
Balan has told lot about
you, l'm his best friend.

01:14:58.594 --> 01:14:59.390
Ummer!

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:06.364
Go man, fatty!

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:41.530
Right from childhood
hearing, learn from elder brother.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:44.597
But still now, l've not seen what
is there for me to learn from him?

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.842
A very best brother, if she
weren't there, could have seen.

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.203
ln front of that ex-girl friend
of yours and that mad brother...

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:51.471
...we would be busted.

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:54.582
Now all those people who thought
you are depressed got shocked.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.875
She is not bad, is it not?
Then what?

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:59.986
Hey man, she is our 'the one'.

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:03.083
But a fool like you,
l've not seen in life.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:06.427
Thinking that long back you
had a dislike, what a pity!

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:10.091
Hey man, why can't you love her?

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:14.429
Balan K Nair and Sheela.
You are the only one who ruins me.

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:18.128
Not that, after all we've taken lot
of efforts to find her is it not?

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:21.240
Now that girl, is this girl.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.640
Son, what all plays of god.

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:27.247
Hey man, its true that
for fun tried to find her.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:30.883
But that won't go well.
But anyway you've got a good friend.

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:33.453
You call her and tell will meet.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.425
Art gallery, didn't find
any other place to meet?

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:42.394
No!

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:47.627
You come.
Over here what to do with me?

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.468
Hey man, we will walk and
see all the paintings and all.

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:52.003
What to walk? l'm not there.

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:53.232
Go and see it and come.
Then go!

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:54.375
l'll be somewhere over there.

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:05.148
Did the brother go?

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:07.515
Who knows.

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:15.528
So where are Balan's
parents and all?

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:19.525
They all are still in Dubai.
Atypical doctorfamily.

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:22.602
Father, mother, elder
brother everyone.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:28.171
ls Balan not interested in all this?

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.540
Elder brother was everyone's
pet, a good son.

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.909
l was not talented in anything,
not interested in medicine.

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.175
An average student.

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:41.117
Leave all that, when did
you return from Dubai?

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:45.458
The life out there, my parents
were not interested in that.

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:49.927
But Bangalore, its in this
city where their nostalgia is.

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:55.627
lts over here where they first met.
Fell in love and married.

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.631
Where Sheela studied and all?

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.737
School and college
was all at Shimla.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.672
So during vacations
used to come here and return.

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:08.380
Because of that, there aren't
many friends over here.

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:29.260
The common man, the comic strip
of R.K Lakshman, in Times of lndia.

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:32.066
From 1950 onwards for
about half a century.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:35.639
That person was my childhood
hero total genius.

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:39.213
Truly l joined Times
to become a cartoonist.

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:46.713
l told parents that l met
Balan, they rememberyou.

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:50.082
They really rememberthat old duck.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:53.150
Told to bring you home one day.

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.558
Anyway, shall l leave?

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:09.271
Day aftertomorrow what is
the plan? lts New Year's eve, is it?

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:11.638
There is no big plan, like that.

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:15.107
Just with some friends
a small new year's party.

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:18.781
At 12 O'clock, l just want
to scream my lungs out.

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:23.785
Why not before the party,
a dinner at my place?

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:27.094
After the dinner l'll
drop you immediately.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.626
l'll come.
l'll see you there.

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:29.573
Any..Do you want any help?

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:34.421
Just 5 minutes, l'll set this now.

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.360
Shall l..

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:29.741
This is Ummer's father's house,
purchased from some French lady.

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:34.976
But for the time being we don't
intend to move out from here.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:40.213
And then where is Ummer?
Ummer, is not like me.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.256
Very busy.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.493
Shall we dine?

01:22:57.906 --> 01:23:00.875
That bully during
those times, cooked all this?

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:07.538
What was it for? A dinner like
this after taking this much effort.

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:11.345
Just take it as an
apology, l was bit rude.

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:17.991
You were saying a
break while studying.

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:24.387
Didn't l say Balan, l love this city.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:27.692
So, our Bangalore, one gap here.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:33.072
Marriage, boy friend.
What are you taking interview?

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:33.864
Yes.

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.577
Well, l've not thought
of marriage and all.

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.988
He is the son offather's client.

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:50.887
l don't know whether
to call as a boy friend.

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:54.886
So far, we've not
spend much time together.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:58.662
When l was in Shimla,
Rahul was over here.

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:02.098
When l returned, Rahul
went to London.

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:04.928
For the last month
vacation, was here.

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:08.564
Rahul, nice name.

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.604
How is the person?

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:20.386
Rahul's, father is a
big builder over here.

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:23.318
All in all an ideal husband material.

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:28.960
Really a journalist!
Again how many questions are left?

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:32.830
l'm not that kind of
a typical girl Balan.

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.661
l don't believe in this
romance and love.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:38.466
Has seen lot of love
stories at college and all.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.939
The endings of all that was tragedy.
Why simply?

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:49.974
All the girls within themselves
they are romantics, is it not?

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:55.384
Todays love is practical. lfthere is
no boy friend, while choosing a husband.

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.082
Should look into hundred things.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.827
Education, family, bank balance,
prospectus, is he bald?

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:10.064
See, for our generation our
parents have given lot offreedom.

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:13.869
ln my case, l can
choose my life partner.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.009
So while getting a freedom like that.

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:18.975
Naturally, we children
will become more responsible.

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:23.541
This pulp love and things
were all during my parents time.

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:33.821
l've never experienced
this thing, love, so far.

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:53.408
Shall l leave?
Before leaving, shall we take a photo?

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:20.666
This was lost on that night.
All these days it was with me.

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:24.501
Should have returned
earlier, l'm sorry.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.841
Somehow, didn't feel like returning.

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:44.963
Balan, doesn't know
the importance ofthis camera.

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:55.138
l was thinking to ask?
Why do you need such a camera?

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:59.280
Will tell that some other time.

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:09.146
ln fact why don't you join me Balan?

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:37.807
Where is Ummer?
l've send the text telling to come.

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:39.144
Will call and see.

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:45.520
Where are you? We've reached.

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:48.060
Have you reached?
l'm 5 minutes away, will reach now.

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:46.351
lts food poison.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:52.760
lts New Year, no?
While dining out must be careful.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:56.193
No doctor it was not dining out side,
it was due to eating from inside.

01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:57.695
Look, this guy was the cook.

01:28:57.899 --> 01:28:59.833
You go and buy
medicine from Pharmacy.

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:42.909
The new editor was
a Bombay Malayalee.

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:45.910
JP Varma, young and dynamic.

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:49.241
Many have thought that
he was the future oftimes.

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:52.011
l had decided to
impress him somehow.

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:59.889
To work with sir,
we are all very excited.

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:05.723
This is an idea on which l'm
working. lts a comic strip.

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:11.404
Sir, any time when sir is free.

01:30:23.017 --> 01:30:26.043
To indulge in your
hobby, l don't have time.

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.448
Even ifthere is time,
this five columns each.

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:32.216
Do you think anyone will read?

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:57.144
This was my parents first
house. Earlier it was on rent.

01:30:57.385 --> 01:30:59.182
Laterthey purchased this one.

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:07.154
At first it was a small house,
later they extended this one.

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:14.993
For my father and mother its a sort
of craze, their olden times and romance.

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:20.363
To escape from busyness of
outside world, very often come here.

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:25.505
l very much love spaces like these.

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:29.816
All these photos and all?
Taken by father.

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:37.814
Balan, haven't you asked on that
day about back story ofthat camera?

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:47.998
My father, purchased this camera
for the first time on saving money.

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:54.099
He very much like photography, this
camera was father's prized possession.

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:58.503
As a gift to their
25 th wedding anniversary.

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:03.010
Through their love
story, a travel of daughter.

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:07.310
That was the idea. On their love
story all these were important places.

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:10.216
Today many are just a relics.

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:13.856
They first met at this chemistry lab.

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:17.428
lt was in this restaurant they
used to hang out after college.

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:19.327
lt was in this movie theater.

01:32:19.433 --> 01:32:21.799
They used to watch
Hindi movies during those times.

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:24.904
lt was in this park,
father proposed to mother.

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:29.574
All these five photos were my gift.
Five photos?

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:32.072
One photo was left out to take.

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:34.272
lt was during that time
the camera was lost.

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:39.544
Which is that place?
Not the place, this scooter.

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:43.249
The scooter was the fifth photo.
All theirjourney was on this one.

01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:48.587
When we went to Dubai, father sold
this, till now was the search forthis.

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:25.393
What?
Will find it in two days.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.862
Will find in two days.

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:39.913
Are you busy? Then get ready fast.
Ummer will come to pick you up.

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:43.413
We'll go to a place.
That is all there.

01:33:43.584 --> 01:33:45.074
When you come take
that camera also.

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:30.520
''Close by, like a rain that showers''

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:40.131
''ln that rain, gets drenched
like a flower''

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:50.006
''When someone is slowly
murmuring the tunes within me''

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:58.949
''When joined in the hand of breeze
we are like feathers, on these paths''

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:08.400
''As you fill the hearts
l become like a wave''

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:19.104
''As you brightens in the eyes
l become a star at night''

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:28.176
''The memories flows on the paths
we both flows along with it''

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:38.284
''Without knowing a song is
spreading in the inner most heart''

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:46.695
''ln that in certain dear most lines
only about your face is highlighted''

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:56.334
''As you fill the hearts
l become like a wave''

01:36:56.510 --> 01:37:07.250
''As you brightens in the eyes
l become a star at night''

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:16.352
''Close by, like a rain that showers''

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:25.869
''ln that rain, gets
drenched like a flower''

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:35.846
''When someone is slowly
murmuring the tunes within me''

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:44.419
''When joined in the hand of breeze
we are like feathers, on these paths''

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:54.228
''As you fill the hearts
l become like a wave''

01:37:54.435 --> 01:38:04.709
''As you brightens in the eyes
l become a star at night''

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:17.351
Let the camera be with me,
after developing these photos.

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:19.320
l'll come with the scooter
forthe anniversary.

01:38:21.695 --> 01:38:24.459
So, shall l go?
Any way came till here, no?

01:38:24.598 --> 01:38:27.260
Meet my parents and go, get down.
Come.

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:37.335
Looks like there is no one at the
house. All the lights are turned off.

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:39.303
l'll take a look and come.

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:51.484
Amma!

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:54.622
Rahul!

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:03.897
How did you get inside? Why
suddenly? Told will come next month.

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:05.466
Didn't you wait for the graduation?

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:11.941
Graduation is only a
formality, is it not?

01:39:12.413 --> 01:39:14.779
When there are certain things
which are more important than that.

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:18.975
Thought will come bit early.

01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:23.753
l'm very much here, is it not? Could
have waited for graduation.

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:33.400
Would you marry me?

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:01.657
Sorry daughter, it was Rahul's idea.

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:06.799
Actually engagement should
be conducted next week...

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.663
...that's what Rahul's
parents are saying.

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:12.339
There is no difference
of opinion is it not?

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:29.707
Whom are you looking?
No one.

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:31.847
(Yes, yes)

01:41:34.388 --> 01:41:37.016
Will give now, son Rahul,
one second its Menon uncle.

01:41:41.962 --> 01:41:45.693
Dear come on, come inside.

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:56.432
''As you fill the hearts
l become like a wave''

01:41:56.577 --> 01:42:06.179
''As you brightens in the eyes
l become a star at night''

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:31.570
Hallo.
Hallo, where did you go?

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:34.040
When l came out and
looked there was no person!

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:37.542
Not that, Ummer
called me immediately.

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.853
Rahul, came back
and he has proposed me.

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:52.157
Okay, l'll call afterwards,
there is everyone over here.

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:42.172
Yea, have you come again?

01:43:42.683 --> 01:43:45.584
The last meeting with
sir was really helpful.

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:49.287
l took it as a challenge, the
readers will definitely like it.

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:51.922
l'm sure about that, sir
must read this and see.

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:55.989
What do you intend?
On drawing this cartoon.

01:43:57.297 --> 01:44:01.597
lf you like to draw that much, go to the
street and draw the caricature oftourists.

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:05.931
Because ofthis you are not
going to have any future.

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:09.540
Sir, without even looking at
this, judging me and my talent.

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:13.172
lf at least once after reading
this, and ifyou say like this.

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:15.781
l promise you l'll never
disturb sir again, with this.

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:19.183
Hmm..Okay leave that here
and Balan you may leave.

01:44:23.023 --> 01:44:24.786
When l get time l'll
read this and see.

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:26.992
Thank you sir, that is enough.

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:38.195
So at last the editor
has taken it, is it?

01:44:38.572 --> 01:44:41.666
Good going man, he'll like it.
l'm sure.

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:47.009
What happened to you? Right from
morning noticing, a sort of mood out.

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:50.180
No need of that.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:53.845
Any way to correct your mood there
is an office party, today evening.

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:57.717
Don't you know its a costume party,
must come as a movie character.

01:44:57.958 --> 01:45:00.586
On the house party,
call Ummer also.

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:10.996
Any way we are villains,
then will go as villains.

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:28.785
l'm Bat Man's enemy joker.
And Ummer in his own opinion.

01:45:29.022 --> 01:45:31.286
All around the world, the
weakness of entire females.

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:35.589
Became the 'Prince Draculla'
who is the king of darkness!

01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:23.031
Hey son Ummer, what
you told is true.

01:46:26.246 --> 01:46:33.414
l must see her, very now!
l must say l love her.

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:44.288
lfyou love her, hold your chest high
and say that on going to her house.

01:46:53.807 --> 01:46:58.835
lf required l'll also come.
This Balan K Nair is solo tusker!

01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.807
l'll go all alone.
Okay.

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:31.838
Where is the bell?

01:47:32.078 --> 01:47:33.705
Calling bell?

01:48:33.406 --> 01:48:34.839
lts me!

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:38.073
That Balan is there, no?

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:45.550
Come.

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:55.291
Why is it like this?

01:48:55.495 --> 01:48:58.225
How?
Why at this time, at the house?

01:48:58.431 --> 01:48:59.329
Don't worry.

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:04.832
No one has seen, came to say
one thing, will say that and go.

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:07.897
Where is that?
Why Balan, like this at the house?

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:26.118
Right from the moment when
that camera was obtained.

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:29.126
To find you, what all
things l and Ummer did.

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:36.265
At first it was a time pass
and later met you unexpectedly.

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:39.531
Became close, l can't,
without seeing you.

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:44.909
Are you not having food?
Coming.

01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:50.946
What is this? ls it a room?

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:56.853
Till l come back, keep quite.

01:50:08.101 --> 01:50:10.092
We have started okay as
Molu (dear one) was not seen.

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:14.432
Hey Molu, this was send
by Rahul's fatherfrom ltaly.

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:19.875
Daughter, that person in charge
of flower arrangements had called.

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.646
Asked what's your
color preference?

01:50:23.049 --> 01:50:24.983
Orchids, white orchids.
Nice.

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:26.914
Don't you want chapatti?
One will do.

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:30.250
Just taste this.

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:33.150
Rahul's mother has called,
spoke about lot ofthings.

01:50:35.695 --> 01:50:38.061
ls your friend list and all ready?

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.035
So far, has not fixed my dress.
You just relax.

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:47.005
Molu, take sardine and eat.

01:51:31.484 --> 01:51:34.385
Balan!
Balan!

01:51:51.104 --> 01:51:54.699
The time l've spend
with Balan, l've enjoyed it.

01:51:58.611 --> 01:52:05.414
l've not thought anything else. The
girl who is going to live with Balan...

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:14.220
No girl who has got
a bit of kindness...

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:17.454
...will never say doesn't
like him, looking at his face.

01:52:17.664 --> 01:52:21.293
On the contrary will say only
this, likes to hang out with you.

01:52:21.434 --> 01:52:24.995
Likes your sense of humor.
Likes the way you care.

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:27.402
But only you doesn't like!

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:32.169
lfyou marry anyone, she will be
lucky, all sorts ofthings like that.

01:52:32.345 --> 01:52:35.075
Then ifthat is the case, why
can't you be that lucky girl?

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:38.514
Why is that? Don't you
like luck coming to life?

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:44.022
Balan, l've given word to Rahul.

01:52:44.357 --> 01:52:47.520
Don't belittle me by
calling Balan, Balan!

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:50.696
What is that l lack?
Don't l've brains?

01:52:51.064 --> 01:52:53.191
Am l not handsome?

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:57.392
Education..
Balan, what is required in life is stability.

01:52:58.404 --> 01:52:59.735
With Rahul, l get that.

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:05.773
But l believe in you, Balan will get
a girl as you wish in your mind.

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:19.190
All this love is complicated,
it has got an ugly side.

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:27.795
Jealousy, ego,
possessiveness, fighting.

01:53:29.869 --> 01:53:32.235
Let all that be seen by Rahul.

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:40.242
Enough!
Ours is a finest relationship.

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:44.643
Friendship, so we'll
continue as good friends.

01:53:45.385 --> 01:53:47.353
That is my decision.

01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:50.848
Balan, do you res..
Boring!

01:53:53.726 --> 01:53:54.590
Balan!

01:54:06.673 --> 01:54:08.800
How much space is there?

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:19.844
Hey wait, wait, wait!

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:27.219
So, there is no history, Bala
K Nair returning empty handed.

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:40.369
Come!

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:46.345
What is this?
ls it gate way of lndia?

01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:35.253
So, you are Balan K Nair, no?

01:55:36.663 --> 01:55:38.563
lndeed a villain!

01:55:39.499 --> 01:55:40.397
That is..

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.561
Give that tea, let his hang
over get reduced.

01:56:22.909 --> 01:56:26.276
At night, we'll discuss why you
had come byjumping the gate.

01:56:26.412 --> 01:56:28.710
Anyway haven't you come
home for the first time?

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:31.681
After having breakfast,
will do it, is it so?

01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:53.700
Looks like Balan is a silent person.

01:56:55.942 --> 01:56:58.570
That is because of
meeting Rahul, forthe first time.

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:01.777
Working in Times, is it not?

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:05.441
Actually, Balan's ambition
is to become a cartoonist.

01:57:09.822 --> 01:57:12.086
Who doesn't like
comics and cartoons?

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:20.922
Hallo, Mother.

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:25.865
Don't keep anything in mind.

01:57:26.039 --> 01:57:29.008
l've not informed Sheela
anything. Honestly speaking.

01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:31.706
When she told she will
introduce her friend.

01:57:32.145 --> 01:57:34.909
l never expected that it will be you.

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:38.951
l never used to keep any grudges.

01:57:44.457 --> 01:57:46.482
On that day itself, l've
told you, haven't l?

01:57:46.692 --> 01:57:51.959
The competition is held between
the equals. The people like you.

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:55.331
Are not even listed in
the friend's bracket.

01:57:56.536 --> 01:58:00.404
Thinking will get a girl like
Sheela, that is your naivete.

01:58:00.606 --> 01:58:04.702
l've considered only like that.
And on that day challenging me.

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:18.980
Honey moon is planned overthere.
No chance Balan might know.

01:58:19.592 --> 01:58:23.494
The sun set beside the Aaron River
at Florence, is the most romantic.

01:58:27.834 --> 01:58:28.960
ls it not?

01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:33.571
Will go?
Okay.

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:38.136
Will see you for engagement.

01:58:49.522 --> 01:58:51.012
Rahul, one minute.

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:06.428
Rahul, there are more romantic sun
sets at Florence than Aaron River.

01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:11.576
No chance Rahul
might be knowing it.

01:59:11.777 --> 01:59:14.211
lts a square in the name
of Michel Angelo.

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:19.742
South ofthe city. One of the most
boutiques of Florence is from there.

01:59:23.256 --> 01:59:26.157
At Florence, everything
else is lagged behind it.

02:01:25.278 --> 02:01:27.610
Like that you are also
going to be practical.

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:28.776
ls it not Ummachi?

02:01:28.981 --> 02:01:31.973
After a stage everyone
should be practical.

02:01:32.218 --> 02:01:34.209
How long to live like this?

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:39.550
lt has been very long, father
saying to do MBA on going to U.S.

02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:42.183
Should fulfill one wish of his.

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:44.625
Yesterday offer letter
has come from U.S.

02:01:44.797 --> 02:01:48.995
lf l don't go for visa interview
tomorrow, within 2 days will come back.

02:01:49.302 --> 02:01:52.601
Then till going to U.S,
at the native home.

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:57.568
True, if its California, that is
good for your gaming.

02:01:58.844 --> 02:02:04.282
Gaming? What gaming?
Even l don't know what l want.

02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:08.086
Every time some other madness,
today gaming, tomorrow something else.

02:02:08.254 --> 02:02:11.712
l go after that also. But your
case is not like that.

02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:16.222
You know what you want.
ls there life without hurdles?

02:02:16.429 --> 02:02:20.297
God will put hurdles only those
which can be overcome by us.

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:24.361
Ummer, this is not your video
game to overcome the hurdles.

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:27.002
lts life.

02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:29.199
l'm also saying regarding
the matter of life.

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:32.833
Haven't you asked? Why,
doesn't my father know to smile?

02:02:33.079 --> 02:02:34.239
There is always anger on the face.

02:02:34.313 --> 02:02:38.079
As you think that's not due to
tension on thinking about me.

02:02:38.451 --> 02:02:41.079
Hey man, the name ofthat is love.

02:02:42.355 --> 02:02:46.223
During our age he also had a love.

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:51.186
When the girl's family members
threatened, father didn't have the guts.

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:55.233
He was a coward, that girl got
married and she had gone.

02:02:55.434 --> 02:02:57.732
Later father lived in
a sort of sternness.

02:02:57.870 --> 02:03:00.361
Went to Bombay
and made lot of money.

02:03:00.473 --> 02:03:04.409
Came back and started a business
in the native, married my mother.

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:07.873
But that girl did not
depart from his memory.

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:11.245
No matter how much he tried,
father couldn't adjust with mother.

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:12.408
They got separated.

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:16.186
All these stories when mother
was telling me, l've thought.

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:18.118
lffather had shown some
guts during that time.

02:03:18.324 --> 02:03:20.792
Today how many people
would have lived happily.

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:24.023
Today, in the position
of my father, its you.

02:03:24.296 --> 02:03:28.665
Now ifyou don't show guts, like father
throughout life you'll be in grief.

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:32.463
Like what you said, we
see several girls daily.

02:03:32.805 --> 02:03:36.434
But the correct companion, that
will happen only once in life.

02:03:36.776 --> 02:03:40.143
Sheela's only engagement
is over, wedding is not finished.

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:44.444
Again time is there, all though you
have one chance in thousand!

02:03:44.784 --> 02:03:46.775
You must fight for her.

02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:52.014
This emotion and all, is
not meant for me, man.

02:04:02.168 --> 02:04:05.797
l've seen a Ummer on that day
which l haven't seen till then.

02:04:06.005 --> 02:04:10.442
ln the previous birth he must be a
army chief in some Roman army.

02:04:40.005 --> 02:04:42.371
Afterthe visa interview day after
tomorrow l'll come over to here.

02:04:42.575 --> 02:04:44.338
And then to Kozhikode.

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:48.810
Go and tune the English
ladies in the embassy.

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:22.109
Sir, is a person who is
handling responsible post.

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:23.375
l had respected you.

02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:26.540
The place where it belongs
is at the waste bin.

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:28.183
To say that looking at my face.
You have the authority to say that.

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.447
But doing like that without even
opening it and seeing, that is bad.

02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:36.886
You must start the
next sentence with a sorry.

02:05:39.431 --> 02:05:43.231
l won't give you the
satisfaction on firing me, l quit!

02:05:45.437 --> 02:05:48.531
No one is going to hire
you and l'll see to it.

02:06:50.502 --> 02:06:57.169
Ho! Finally. So irresponsible.
Balan l called you a hundred times.

02:06:58.143 --> 02:07:00.577
Without calling me all these
days, suddenly to talk like this.

02:07:00.913 --> 02:07:01.902
What mistake did l do?

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:05.312
Balan, had given me the word,
l expected you to keep it.

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:07.951
Today is the wedding
anniversary, did you forget it?

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:11.147
Where are the photos?
l'm sorry, l forgot.

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:12.955
l'll come now.

02:07:21.967 --> 02:07:26.336
Like everybody knows.
lts our 25th wedding anniversary.

02:07:28.273 --> 02:07:30.901
But this time its a special occasion.

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:35.070
This is not arranged by
us, but by our daughter Sheela.

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:37.545
The treasure in our life.

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:40.241
Our Molu, Sheela.

02:07:55.134 --> 02:07:57.500
Definitely its an official invite.

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:08.569
l know got late, all the
photos are on this pen drive.

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:31.269
Anyway, to speak few
words to all ofyou.

02:08:32.071 --> 02:08:36.371
The event host, l invite our
darling daughter Sheela.

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:54.592
So while thinking what gift to give
on their 25th wedding anniversary.

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:57.351
A playfulness which l've felt.

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:02.218
Genius idea Molu.

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:08.664
l can't accept the entire credit.
Balan is the one who did all this.

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:14.396
When he was bit late to
turn up, l spoke a bit rudely.

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:17.441
Now on calling, can't get him.
The phone is switched off.

02:10:19.912 --> 02:10:23.313
Poorfellow, he might have felt sad.

02:10:24.383 --> 02:10:27.511
Molu, go and see and
come after telling a sorry.

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:30.514
Yes daughter, go.

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:49.368
l had gone to the house.
Saw no one overthere.

02:10:49.942 --> 02:10:52.672
Then figured out, must be here.

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:57.413
Where is Ummer?
Gone. To where?

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:12.329
Those photos..No one
has done like that for me.

02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:21.865
Not only father and
mother l was also surprised.

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:26.337
Not only for yourfather and mother,
for me also this day is special.

02:11:26.912 --> 02:11:28.504
Today is my birth day.

02:11:34.586 --> 02:11:38.352
On this day l realize l'm
alone on this earth.

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:42.391
Own family members haven't called,
usually Ummer will be there at least.

02:11:44.563 --> 02:11:47.657
l'm there, no?
How long?

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:52.698
Once yourwedding is over, you
will be also busy, won't you?

02:11:52.871 --> 02:11:57.171
Few days we all spends some time
together, then will part to theirways.

02:12:11.356 --> 02:12:14.621
Will go home, come l'll drop you.

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:23.191
That fellow is there, no?
That Rahul.

02:12:23.869 --> 02:12:26.633
Has he evertried to
understand you?

02:12:27.005 --> 02:12:31.533
Your likes, passions
has he ever tried to know?

02:12:33.378 --> 02:12:37.838
Like everyone, you also
thought of a secured future.

02:12:39.751 --> 02:12:42.447
What girls want is stability.

02:12:46.625 --> 02:12:49.890
How easy it is for me
to become like Rahul.

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:53.660
At any time.
Even now!

02:12:54.066 --> 02:12:57.433
Along with father
justjoin family business.

02:12:57.602 --> 02:13:00.036
But l was firm on my convictions.

02:13:02.074 --> 02:13:05.475
Then l became a
loser in front ofyou.

02:13:19.992 --> 02:13:24.861
Didn't you say on that day, there is
no pulp love like your parents, now?

02:13:25.063 --> 02:13:27.588
Sheela, love is pulp at
that time and now.

02:13:27.733 --> 02:13:29.633
Since there is a romantic within you.

02:13:29.735 --> 02:13:32.363
That is the reason why you
gave a gift like that to parents.

02:13:33.405 --> 02:13:36.602
You askto them,
in a breeze like this.

02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:40.275
That pleasure while going
in that old scooter sitting close.

02:13:40.412 --> 02:13:42.744
Can it be gained while sitting
in Rahul's sports car?.

02:13:44.349 --> 02:13:48.752
Rahul, his very name is a cliche!

02:13:50.088 --> 02:13:53.387
ln all the Hindi movies, same
is Shah Rukh Khan's name .

02:13:53.558 --> 02:13:56.049
ln the climax the heroine
will go along with Rahul also.

02:13:56.361 --> 02:14:00.092
As of now, no heroine has
gone with Balan K Nair.

02:14:00.599 --> 02:14:02.931
Tomorrow morning
exactly at 10 O'clock.

02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:06.730
l'll be there in front ofyour
house with that old scooter.

02:14:06.938 --> 02:14:12.774
lf you have the guts. To be original.
Come along with villain.

02:14:13.779 --> 02:14:16.577
Should come along
with this Balan K Nair.

02:15:21.213 --> 02:15:29.985
''Like the color of heart, like the
petal of love fill like a rose flower''

02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:39.722
''Come like a tender love, the breeze
of love, give an embrace to this night''

02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:49.939
''The sky will showerthe cluster of
stars, you come along like a cloud''

02:15:50.142 --> 02:15:52.201
''Swimming river of memories...''

02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:58.972
''...renders chill in heart,
today sang the silence''

02:15:59.117 --> 02:16:07.684
''Like the color of heart, like the
petal of love fill like a rose flower''

02:16:08.059 --> 02:16:18.526
''Come like a tender love, the breeze
of love give an embrace to this night''

02:16:47.264 --> 02:16:56.230
''The setting sun like a bunch of
flowers, you come in my lonely paths''

02:16:56.508 --> 02:16:58.874
''Comes wafting in the wind...''

02:16:59.076 --> 02:17:04.777
''...you come like a fragrance
settling in the cage of my heart''

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:14.154
''With out saying there are certain
things in the corner of the heart''

02:17:14.759 --> 02:17:24.725
''There are certain things which
withers away, without saying beloved''

02:17:52.831 --> 02:18:02.172
''Long back you had nested
in my heart without saying''

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:10.941
''Perhaps unknowingly had taken it,
when you brought the honey of love''

02:18:11.383 --> 02:18:16.548
''Unknowingly, by my side
won't you come as a wave?''

02:18:16.721 --> 02:18:20.781
''l'll dissolve like a form in it''

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:26.020
''Like an ember, like a tale you come
to deliver the heart filled with love''

02:18:26.197 --> 02:18:30.293
''We both shall continue like that''

02:18:30.368 --> 02:18:39.003
''Like the color of heart, like the
petal of love fill like a rose flower''

02:18:39.311 --> 02:18:48.879
''Come like a tender love, the breeze
of love give a embrace to this night''

02:18:49.321 --> 02:18:58.696
''The sky will showerthe cluster of
stars, you come along like a cloud''

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:01.365
''By swimming river of memories...''

02:19:01.665 --> 02:19:08.629
''...renders chill in heart
today sang the silence''

02:19:46.311 --> 02:19:49.439
Hey, how was the visa interview?

02:19:50.682 --> 02:19:54.140
Where are you going? Hey man,
you don't have to shift the house.

02:19:54.285 --> 02:19:56.378
As long as you are here,
not going to sell this house.

02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:01.921
Ummachi, l'm going man.
To where?

02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:04.420
There is no fixed destination.

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:07.658
Will board on any ofthe
trains going to North.

02:20:08.066 --> 02:20:11.968
Just goes like that.
l know its an eloping.

02:20:13.138 --> 02:20:16.665
But feels like a journey is inevitable.
What about yourjob?

02:20:20.245 --> 02:20:24.272
Without mobile and internet,
must live freely for some time.

02:20:25.417 --> 02:20:28.386
From this city, l've
obtained only you.

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:33.381
ln the mist ofyour hectic schedule
at California, l'll call one day.

02:20:34.759 --> 02:20:36.784
Till then, good luck.

02:20:39.864 --> 02:20:42.958
My Ummachi, will have all the
success and happiness.

02:20:45.503 --> 02:20:49.166
And infinite amount of
dollars and lot of super models.

02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.184
l'll drop.
No, l'll go.

02:21:09.894 --> 02:21:14.228
You must do a help for me.
Must hand over the scooter to her.

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:35.081
Sheela, without thinking you haven't
taken any decision so far, impulsively.

02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:37.518
This one, should not be
a first decision ofyours.

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:39.416
Like that, that's what
we have to say.

02:21:40.592 --> 02:21:41.820
Daughter then where is he?

02:21:41.993 --> 02:21:45.190
Hasn't he told that he'll come and
meet you today morning at 10 O'clock?

02:21:51.035 --> 02:21:53.560
Phone is switched off.

02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:12.052
Balan, told to hand
over the vehicle, over here.

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:13.817
Where is Balan?
He has gone.

02:22:13.992 --> 02:22:14.856
To where?

02:22:15.426 --> 02:22:16.552
Somewhere to North.

02:22:16.861 --> 02:22:19.227
Will go in a train that heads a
long way, that's what he told.

02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:21.796
Let him go anywhere what
does it matterto Sheela?

02:22:21.933 --> 02:22:24.231
Sheela, only has to take care
of Rahul's matters, is it not?

02:22:38.249 --> 02:22:40.410
l've decided to be original.

02:22:51.095 --> 02:22:53.154
Morning at 10 O'clock will
be here, with the scooter.

02:22:53.298 --> 02:22:55.425
Yesterday he has told
to come with him.

02:22:55.567 --> 02:22:58.559
Where is he?
Was he drunk, when he told this?

02:22:59.070 --> 02:22:59.627
Yea.

02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:02.132
Then he doesn't remember
what he told yesterday.

02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:03.968
He has left.
What?

02:23:05.276 --> 02:23:07.073
Ummer, take the vehicle.

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:09.542
Daughter where are you going?

02:23:11.115 --> 02:23:13.106
This is that, old scooter
of mine, is it not?

02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:15.309
Yea, that's true.
Father, will look at the vehicle later.

02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:18.619
Hey Molu.
Sheela.

02:23:27.098 --> 02:23:30.590
ln most ofthe love stories the
climax will be at the railway station.

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:33.126
Before that, no matter
how much time is there.

02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:36.637
When hero boards the train to leave,
at that time only heroine will enter.

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:41.467
Unfortunately, the climax of my love
story was not this much cinematic.

02:25:08.599 --> 02:25:10.260
Are you a mallu?

02:25:11.102 --> 02:25:12.364
A Malayalee?

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:18.269
Till Goa got a company. Otherwise by
sitting with old men, must get busted.

02:25:19.444 --> 02:25:21.036
Buddy, where to?

02:25:23.314 --> 02:25:26.181
l'm going to Goa,
Dude there is party.

02:25:26.284 --> 02:25:29.344
Full moon party, can
chill out with good chicks.

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:32.650
Simply come buddy.
What is this buddy?

02:25:33.424 --> 02:25:34.584

02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:42.599
Hallo buddy, l've boarded,
when will you come?

02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:47.697
No, no need ofthis number.
Roaming is on the other number.

02:25:48.573 --> 02:25:49.437
l'll say...

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:53.406
890 8911 111.

02:25:54.278 --> 02:25:55.302
Yea, fancy.

02:25:58.216 --> 02:25:59.114
Okay buddy.

02:26:01.419 --> 02:26:06.356
Now he is calling from this
number. Note this. 890 8911 111 .

02:26:13.731 --> 02:26:16.791
While seeing getting up and going
l thought you withdrew from it.

02:26:17.168 --> 02:26:23.129
The name is Mr. Nair. Phone
number, 8089 2122 00

02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:28.175
Girl, don't you want your thing?

02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:30.711
Stop there fellow!

02:27:45.756 --> 02:27:47.724
He is not in here, he has left.

02:27:50.161 --> 02:27:52.755
Hey psycho, stop there!

02:27:54.398 --> 02:27:55.160
Look!

02:27:57.935 --> 02:28:00.369
Bala!
Stop, fellow!

02:28:00.905 --> 02:28:03.271
Balan!
You'll call, no?

02:28:04.909 --> 02:28:07.878
Hey man, Bala!

02:28:10.648 --> 02:28:12.275

02:28:12.483 --> 02:28:14.280
Stop there, fellow!
Balan!

02:28:14.585 --> 02:28:15.574
Hey you fellow!

02:28:25.897 --> 02:28:27.296
l won't use mobile again.
Call, fellow!

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:28.363
Honestly!

02:28:28.566 --> 02:28:30.796
True, upon Mohammed Ali.
Who is he?

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:32.963
He is that psycho.
ls he that psycho?

02:28:33.371 --> 02:28:34.838
Chetta, must go for the party.

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:36.598
You'll call for girl's things, no?

02:28:55.793 --> 02:28:58.728
Let me say.

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:04.792
l know all this love is complicated
and it has got an ugly side.

02:29:04.936 --> 02:29:08.303
l've told, today's love
is practical, that all.

02:29:08.639 --> 02:29:13.008
l've also told, l don't trust in pulp
love during the time of my parents.

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:20.476
But till now l've not
experienced the thing called love.

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:36.889
l, need to go with villain.

02:29:57.888 --> 02:30:01.847
Didn't l say?
During climax she will be with me.

02:30:06.931 --> 02:30:07.761
Hold.
Fellow, start this.

02:30:07.898 --> 02:30:08.728
Kick, man.

02:30:11.969 --> 02:30:13.436
Kick, kick.

02:30:16.607 --> 02:30:17.801
Hey fellow!

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:19.633
Hey fellow!
Fatty!

02:30:51.776 --> 02:30:55.610
Balan's friend Ummer
is with us at the studio.

02:30:55.913 --> 02:30:58.381
What was those stories
behind that incident?

02:30:58.516 --> 02:31:01.451
l never expected such
a recognition for him.

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:05.711
Just for fun only l've send his
sketches to Obama, through twitter.

02:31:06.090 --> 02:31:09.719
Last week, very unexpected
Obama tweeted me back.

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:12.658
Balan's sketches are
viral on internet, now.

02:31:12.963 --> 02:31:15.932
At present lot of publishers are
calling from London and New York.

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:18.500
Demanding Balan's comic strip.

02:31:34.185 --> 02:31:35.982
Where is Balan, now?

02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:37.981
Balan...
