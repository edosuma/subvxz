WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:06.807
Ooh, that Gladys can sure
talk your ear off.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.543
92 years of stories
packed into that tiny body--

00:09.577 --> 00:11.079
what a treasure.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.746
And she always makes it
worth your while.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.048
She always makes it
worth your while.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.216
I swear, if I had a dollar
for every time

00:15.249 --> 00:16.550
we had to come here
for nothing...

00:16.584 --> 00:18.419
- You'd have $4 this week.
- Yeah.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.088
Actually, it's $5,
if you count the time

00:20.121 --> 00:22.590
I had to go back to get
my pen that Johnny left there.

00:22.623 --> 00:23.991
Why would
we count that?

00:24.024 --> 00:25.693
I guess I just wanted
to bring up the fact

00:25.726 --> 00:27.628
that Johnny left my pen
and never apologized.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.931
I'm sorry, Brian.
I apologize.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.833
Oh, don't give it
a second thought, John, really.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.502
And I pre-apologize
for all the times in the future

00:34.535 --> 00:36.404
I'm gonna misplace
your pen.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.405
Copy that.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.712
[hip-hop music]

00:44.745 --> 00:48.416
*

00:48.449 --> 00:49.617
I've been meaning
to ask you,

00:49.650 --> 00:51.419
how is your--
your landlord doing?

00:51.452 --> 00:53.287
Oh-ho.
Uh-oh.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.722
- What?
- [chuckles]

00:54.755 --> 00:56.023
You trying to hook back up
with him?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.691
No, it's not like that.
I was just...

00:57.725 --> 00:58.626
- You were just--
- No, he's been texting me.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.428
- So I was just--
- Okay.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.795
You were just thinking about
trying to hook back up with him.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.564
No, I-I just wanted to know
how he's doing.

01:03.597 --> 01:04.798
Okay.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.234
Look, I am
a friendly person.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.068
Oh.
Oh, I know.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.637
[whispers]
I know. It's...

01:09.670 --> 01:11.205
- Dickheads.
- Oh.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.740
[all laughing]

01:12.773 --> 01:14.442
Honestly,
I don't see him very often,

01:14.475 --> 01:15.976
but he did mention the other day
that he got a shipment

01:16.009 --> 01:17.711
of artisanal soaps delivered,
so I'm guessing,

01:17.745 --> 01:19.213
at the very least,
he's clean.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.448
Eh.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.982
I mean,
if he just had any idea

01:22.015 --> 01:23.217
of how pretentious he was,

01:23.251 --> 01:24.885
I'd take him back
in a heartbeat.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.287
So you don't care
that he's pretentious,

01:26.320 --> 01:27.255
as long as he knows
he's pretentious.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.622
He's really cute, John.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.458
- If you like blonds.
- Well, I do.

01:30.491 --> 01:31.759
(woman over radio)
Chicago North.
Ambulance needed.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.327
728 Greenfield Avenue.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.163
- Oh.
- Shit.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.465
- Ambulance 14 responding.
- Here we go.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.966
- Hold on tight, Brian.
- I always hold on tight.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.301
Well, hold on tighter,

01:40.334 --> 01:41.402
'cause we are heading
into the shit.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.070
Downtown Chi-raq.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.573
I think "Chi-raq"
is a negative stereotype

01:45.606 --> 01:46.807
that ends up hurting
both places.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.941
Hmm, just a couple
of ancient river towns

01:47.975 --> 01:49.643
that have fallen
on hard times.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.412
Maybe we should become
sister cities with Baghdad.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.580
Mm, I guess Chicago
already has one.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.814
Oh, we have 28.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.684
Uh, Toronto,
Athens, Bogotá,

01:56.717 --> 01:59.520
Moscow, Lahore,
Shanghai...

01:59.553 --> 02:00.821
God, I hope this list
is over soon.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.290
We're not even
halfway home.

02:02.323 --> 02:07.861
Hamburg, Lucerne, Shenyang,
Amman, Delhi--

02:07.895 --> 02:09.530
Oh, Delhi.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.465
[laughing]
Oh, you tricky one.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.368
[siren wailing]

02:16.637 --> 02:18.972
Paramedics!

02:19.006 --> 02:20.374
What took
y'all so long?

02:20.408 --> 02:22.676
Took us--
We got here in six minutes.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.378
If this was Lincoln Park,
you would've been here in two.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.479
That's not
physically possible.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.381
Whatever, professor.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.016
Oh, boy.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.219
All right, what happened?
Oh.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.188
They got me.
What it look like?

02:34.222 --> 02:36.224
Who is "they"?
Are they still here?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.658
N-no.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.126
Look, man, just--
just do what you do.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.894
Man, I bet it was
that bitch midget Lil' J.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.631
Man, it could've
been anybody.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.032
You see, you try to get
out the hood on a rap game,

02:45.065 --> 02:46.300
and this happens.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.901
Hmm, you a rapper?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.670
Psh, don't act
like you ain't heard.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.472
My new joint got 200,000 views
on YouTube.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.507
200,036.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.209
Yo, D, you ain't even
got to be exact, bro.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.077
That don't sound better
than 200,000.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.879
Actually,
it sounds worse.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.414
(Hank)
I must have missed it.
You heard about it, Johnny?

03:00.448 --> 03:01.315
No, I'm not caught up
on my YouTube.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.816
Sorry, pal.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.885
Doesn't ring a bell
for me either,

03:04.918 --> 03:07.221
but I would love an autograph
at some point, if that's okay.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.722
Got you, bro.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.691
- Thought that was your rig.
- Hey, T.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.092
(Billy)
What's up, y'all?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.228
No, no.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.696
No!
Styfl?

03:15.729 --> 03:18.098
* S-t-y-f-l

03:18.131 --> 03:20.167
* So truth, youth,
for life *

03:20.200 --> 03:22.336
That's my song, man.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.872
Hey, it is a pleasure
to meet you, bro.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.206
No doubt, bro.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.442
Yo, Styfl is
a very talented rapper, T.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.777
Man, I bet
I watched your video,

03:29.810 --> 03:31.779
like, 50,000 times
on YouTube, bro.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.248
[gasps]
That's 1/4 of the total views.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.550
Derek, why is there
a shot-up rapper

03:36.584 --> 03:37.951
in your mom's
living room?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.620
Come on, T.
You know how it go.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.755
Yo, D, no snitching, bro.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.524
You know this guy?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.259
Yes, I have known Derek
since he was in high school,

03:45.293 --> 03:47.628
and I know he's gonna tell me
exactly what happened.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.129
D, don't you even--

03:49.162 --> 03:50.264
Hey, if you tell him
to be quiet one more time,

03:50.298 --> 03:51.532
I'm gonna pull
the cuffs out.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.800
She likes
cuffing people, Styfl.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.234
What happened, Derek?

03:54.268 --> 03:55.736
We don't even really know
what happened.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.405
You know, stuff was
just moving so fast and--

03:57.438 --> 03:59.740
You mentioned something
about a midget bitch

03:59.773 --> 04:01.309
named Lil' J,
I believe.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.710
- Really?
- But I didn't say she did it.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.545
Well, would you like me
to tell Lil' J

04:04.578 --> 04:05.579
you've been throwing
her name around?

04:05.613 --> 04:07.448
(Derek)
No. Please, no.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.216
Well, you better start talking
before your mom gets home,

04:09.249 --> 04:10.751
finds blood
all over the carpet,

04:10.784 --> 04:13.120
and I tell her
what I think really went down.

04:13.153 --> 04:16.156
Look, truth is, it wasn't
supposed to be this much blood.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.658
So you shot
your friend.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.059
You shot your friend?
Why?

04:19.092 --> 04:20.127
We had a plan.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.729
I told you, Roger,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.230
we shouldn't be planning shit
when we high.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.132
I promise I will not shoot
nobody again.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.468
I ain't made for this.
I got acid reflux.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.002
What is--
what is going on?

04:29.036 --> 04:31.004
Looks like Captain YouTube
wanted to give himself

04:31.038 --> 04:32.906
a battle scar
to up his profile.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.342
Please, don't tell nobody
about this, okay?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.943
This can kill my career.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.611
And I'm about to be verified
on Twitter.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.480
(Derek)
Please don't tell
my mom, T, please.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.148
Why didn't you guys put down
some towels or something?

04:41.181 --> 04:42.783
My mama's towels?
Oh, no, man.

04:42.816 --> 04:43.917
We wouldn't need
that ambulance out there.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.519
We'd need a hearse.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.820
No, you do not mess
with Mama's good towels.

04:46.854 --> 04:47.821
Okay.
All right.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.423
Here's the deal--

04:49.457 --> 04:50.858
I'm not gonna bring
either one of you in

04:50.891 --> 04:52.259
for reckless endangerment
if you promise

04:52.292 --> 04:53.160
never to use
this bullet-wound situation

04:53.193 --> 04:54.695
in any of your music.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.296
- Oh, hell, no!
- That was the whole point.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.031
No, the second Billy tells me
he heard you brag

04:58.065 --> 05:00.334
about how hard you are
'cause you got shot in the leg,

05:00.368 --> 05:01.669
I'm gonna put the truth
out there.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.870
Psh, man,
who gonna believe you?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.204
Yo, man,
everybody knows Theresa.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.673
You don't even
want to mess with that.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.709
- Man, shut the hell up.
- You shut the hell up.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.051
Can we get some room,
please?

05:18.085 --> 05:21.021
Bunny, Big Mike,
let 'em through.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.499
So Derek's mama
finally shooting

05:31.532 --> 05:32.566
his little
punk-ass friends?

05:32.600 --> 05:33.701
Something like that.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.035
Did Skeet piss off
his sister

05:35.068 --> 05:36.470
while she was doing
his braids again?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.572
Yep.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.073
Come on, man,
you never talk shit

05:40.107 --> 05:41.509
to the person
doing your hair.

05:41.542 --> 05:45.312
That's basic knowledge.
[chuckling]

05:45.345 --> 05:46.414
(Brian)
Did you see how everybody
treated Theresa

05:46.447 --> 05:48.015
in that neighborhood today?

05:48.048 --> 05:49.550
I've never seen Theresa
on the job like that.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.084
She commands
quite a bit of respect.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.820
- Yeah.
- Why do you say it like that?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.488
It's just--Did you see
how they ignored us

05:54.522 --> 05:56.256
until T said "move,"

05:56.289 --> 05:57.991
and then they parted
like the Red Sea?

05:58.025 --> 06:00.193
Well, I mean, Theresa
was getting a little love.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.995
I'll give you that.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.731
How many times have
we been in that neighborhood?

06:03.764 --> 06:04.898
We never get
that kind of reception.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.434
And I'm okay with that.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.035
We're talking about a place
where people

06:08.068 --> 06:09.202
intentionally shoot themselves
to gain credibility.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.004
That doesn't satisfy me.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.340
I mean, we're out there
saving lives too, you know?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.942
Well, what do
you want, man?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.577
- A marching band?
- Sure.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.212
A banner that says
"Welcome, EMTs"?

06:19.246 --> 06:20.581
Maybe the Blue Angels?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.115
- Ooh.
- Or, like, one confetti cannon.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.216
- How about...
- Poof.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.585
- One Blue Angel?
- Okay.

06:24.618 --> 06:25.786
Ah, they're a squadron.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.387
- They never fly alone.
- Oh.

06:27.421 --> 06:28.856
Kind of like us.
We'd have to book 'em all.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.023
Book 'em all, then.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.091
- [imitating jet engine]
- Yes.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.560
Come flying high over.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.594
- [imitating jet engine]
- Yeah, a flyover.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.028
Whoa!
What was that?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.263
- What was that?
- Yeah, we parachute out.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.931
- Like, pkew, pkew, pkew.
- Aah!

06:37.965 --> 06:39.767
A follow light--like, a follow
spotlight follow you down.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.234
- Yeah.
- And the crowd...

06:41.268 --> 06:43.070
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie...

06:43.103 --> 06:44.605
- [imitating crowd roaring]
- Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...

06:44.638 --> 06:46.073
Yeah, look at 'em.
Look at 'em come.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.708
They're coming to save our life.
Johnny!

06:47.741 --> 06:49.643
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Johnny, Johnny!

06:49.677 --> 06:50.644
(all)
Hey, hey, hey!

06:50.678 --> 06:52.245
Good night, Chicago!

06:52.279 --> 06:53.614
- Good night, Chicago.
- We're the EMTs!

06:53.647 --> 06:55.449
(both)
Good night, Chicago.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.885
Don't forget
to tip your waitresses.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.620
- That'd be great.
- Yeah.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.155
Something like that,
that's not too much to ask for,

07:02.189 --> 07:03.991
for starting a heartbeat
back up.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.727
Damn.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.262
It was great
seeing you at work today.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.498
Yeah, you too.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.099
Watching you do
your thing.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.400
I've never seen you
in that light before.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.602
It was awesome.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.136
Yeah.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.905
Those guys give you
a lot of respect.

07:17.938 --> 07:18.939
I am in that neighborhood
a lot.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.007
Yeah?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.174
I bet it's the same for you

07:21.208 --> 07:22.610
in neighborhoods
you're in a lot.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.145
Not like that.
Not really.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.515
I might have a little
extra leeway on that block,

07:27.548 --> 07:29.149
'cause a while back,
I took down this guy

07:29.182 --> 07:31.685
who was, like, the neighborhood
asshole, I guess.

07:31.719 --> 07:32.686
[chuckles]

07:32.720 --> 07:33.754
Really?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.656
Yeah.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.790
Everyone was
kind of scared of him,

07:36.824 --> 07:39.292
and people appreciated it.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.994
And bonus--

07:41.028 --> 07:42.496
now they're scared of me.
[chuckles]

07:42.530 --> 07:44.765
Wh--like,
took him down how?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.434
Like, I took him down.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.469
Like you, uh...

07:49.503 --> 07:51.004
No, no,
I just took him down,

07:51.038 --> 07:53.206
you know, like old-school,
put him on the ground.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.441
You took a guy
from that neighborhood

07:54.474 --> 07:55.676
that everybody was afraid of,

07:55.709 --> 07:57.377
and you just put him
on the ground?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.513
Yeah.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.950
So...

08:02.983 --> 08:05.085
you could totally
take me down?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.823
Let's not have
this conversation,

08:09.857 --> 08:11.391
because, uh, right now

08:11.424 --> 08:13.561
I was kind of hoping
that you would take me down.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.695
Oh, okay.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.363
[chuckles]

08:17.698 --> 08:19.900
[grunts]
Ow.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.034
[chuckles]

08:21.068 --> 08:22.670
- Mmm, mmm.
- Mmm.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.005
Yeah, um, you know what?
We should, uh...

08:25.038 --> 08:26.306
Honey?
[laughs]

08:26.339 --> 08:28.008
- Um, you know what?
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.678
We should totally do this,
but, like, later, like, after

08:30.711 --> 08:31.679
I get back from the gym.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.980
- The gym?
- Yeah.

08:33.013 --> 08:33.914
- It's late. John.
- I know.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.816
I know.
I just...

08:35.849 --> 08:36.750
I just feel like
I should go to the--

08:36.784 --> 08:38.218
go to the gym, you know?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.820
Just kind of, like,
get my cardio on,

08:39.853 --> 08:41.288
maybe push
some weight around.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.025
Just work my...

08:45.058 --> 08:47.260
work my tris
or something.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.700
- Hey.
- Oh.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.835
- Hey.
- What's going on?

08:54.868 --> 08:58.772
Uh, yeah, uh, I was gonna
maybe go see Nick.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.008
Oh.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.543
Oh, cool.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.178
But I'm not gonna go now.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.047
Okay.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.016
Well, you want to walk out?
I'm gonna hit the gym.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.884
It's 11:00 at night.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.786
- This doesn't just happen.
[door opens]

09:12.820 --> 09:14.788
Well, that's obvious.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.625
Hey.
Um, how you doing?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.259
Good.
Oh, um...

09:19.292 --> 09:20.527
you?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.595
Good.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.530
Yeah, good.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.365
Do you, um...

09:25.398 --> 09:27.635
do you want to come up
for a second?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.536
Uh...

09:29.569 --> 09:31.038
um...

09:31.071 --> 09:32.572
is that okay with you,
Johnny?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.307
What?

09:34.341 --> 09:36.710
Well, we've been planning
this trip to the gym

09:36.744 --> 09:38.378
for weeks.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.713
But, yeah. Wha--
I'm kidding.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.650
Yeah, have fun.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.918
- See you, Johnny.
- See you later, Nick.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.820
I'm not--

09:46.854 --> 09:48.588
I'm not going to the gym.
That's--Why would I--

09:48.622 --> 09:50.123
It's stupid.
Why would I go to the gym now?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.665
I'm just saying our profession
deserves a little more respect.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.967
You know what I mean?
Oh-ho-ho!

10:00.000 --> 10:03.336
Good morning,
sunshine.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.072
Thanks for joining us.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.606
Did you take
a little extra time

10:06.640 --> 10:08.408
eating your quail eggs Benedict
this morning?

10:08.441 --> 10:09.977
All right, I hooked up
with Nick again.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.512
Update--still annoying,
still sexy.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.914
What are you talking about?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.148
Johnny was bitching
about our status

10:15.182 --> 10:16.650
in the first-responder
hierarchy.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.351
You're gonna drive
yourself crazy

10:18.385 --> 10:20.087
thinking
like that, Mousse.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.122
We don't do this job
for the credit

10:22.155 --> 10:23.691
or the paycheck.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.526
We do it because we know
we make a difference.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.128
We're the unsung heroes,

10:28.161 --> 10:31.098
but that does not make
what we do any less heroic.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.701
Damn, Cash,
that just got me inspired.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.368
Got a tear welling up,

10:35.402 --> 10:37.604
and I haven't cried
in over five years.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.506
(woman on radio)
Ambulance requested,
674 North Jenkins.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.675
Oh, shit.
Bobby Meds.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.177
Hey.
Thanks for coming, fellas.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.779
- How you doing?
(both) Good.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.982
Brian, this is Bobby Meds,
our favorite ALFD.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.483
- What's that?
- Asshole looking for drugs.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.819
Oh, why?

10:51.852 --> 10:52.953
I said
you're our favorite.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.855
- Oh.
- How you doing, Bobby?

10:54.888 --> 10:57.524
I'm okay, but I have these,
like, searing migraines...

10:57.557 --> 10:59.459
- Oh.
- And also tinnitus.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.794
Really bad tinnitus.
I'm getting this, like, uh--

11:00.828 --> 11:02.529
- Like a sustained drone?
- Yeah, yes.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.297
(all) * Ooh
- You hear it?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.834
- It's like a high-pitched...
(all) * Ooh

11:06.867 --> 11:07.835
- You hear it?
- * Ooh

11:07.868 --> 11:09.069
No, not hearing
any of that.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.971
Well, trust me.
It's a bummer.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.074
And then I'm getting
this, like, skewed-eye effect.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.909
- It's like I'm all periphery.
- Okay.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.477
Oh, okay, well, how many
fingers am I holding up?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.047
No idea.
I can't see it. Can't see it.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.849
Can't see it.
Three?

11:21.882 --> 11:22.883
- He's got "peripheritis."
- Yeah.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.384
What is that?

11:24.417 --> 11:25.753
He just made that up.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.554
- Oh, you know what might help?
- What?

11:27.587 --> 11:30.423
Maybe I should try
some Oxycontin.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.392
Oh, try?
Try some?

11:32.425 --> 11:34.194
Yeah, okay, you're gonna have
to try that at the hospital,

11:34.227 --> 11:35.863
'cause we're not giving you
that shit.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.998
Oh, John,
what's with all the hostility?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.332
I'm--

11:39.366 --> 11:41.001
Something at home
bothering you?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.903
You want to take a minute,
get yourself together?

11:42.936 --> 11:44.571
You want me to get you
some pomegranate juice?

11:44.604 --> 11:45.839
It's delicious.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.074
Oh, please,
that would be fantastic.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.608
- Brian.
- Bobby, get in the rig.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.411
- I do not mind if I do.
- Mm-hmm.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.080
Hey, I know it's a bit
of a hike,

11:53.113 --> 11:54.948
but can you guys
take me to Mercy?

11:54.982 --> 11:56.616
'Cause they hate me
over at Streeterville.

11:56.649 --> 11:57.785
Oh, you mean they're onto you
at Streeterville.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.552
We're gonna take you
to City.

11:59.586 --> 12:02.589
Oh, that's all right.
Is, uh, Jennifer working?

12:02.622 --> 12:04.357
Jennifer S
or Jennifer H?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.426
Jennifer H
got transferred last week.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.528
She's gonna run all of maternity
over at Evanston.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.030
- Did she? Good for her.
- Oh.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.698
- She's such a nice lady.
- She is, Brian.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.566
- You're right.
- How'd you know my name?

12:13.600 --> 12:14.935
Hank said it.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.303
- Did he?
- Yeah.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.472
Still,
very good listening.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.876
[muttering rap lyrics
to self]

12:22.910 --> 12:25.145
Oh, hey, Styfl.
What's going on?

12:25.178 --> 12:26.479
I know you?

12:26.513 --> 12:28.215
Oh, yeah, I'm the EMT
that, uh...

12:28.248 --> 12:31.451
Oh, you the dude go
with the--the cop chick, right?

12:31.484 --> 12:33.086
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.788
What's going on?
What are you doing back here?

12:34.822 --> 12:36.256
Oh, man,
it got all infected.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.091
What?
How'd that happen?

12:38.125 --> 12:39.893
Apparently I was supposed
to change the dressing

12:39.927 --> 12:41.328
or whatever, but...

12:41.361 --> 12:43.230
Oh, yeah, you got to take care
of a wound.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.265
It's rule number one.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.568
I wish they'd have told me that
the last time I was here.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.937
They certainly
should've told you that

12:49.970 --> 12:51.738
the last time
you were here.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.606
What, they didn't give you
any discharge instructions?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.275
Nah.
They must have forgot.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.476
- But it's all right.
- Must have forgot?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.411
That's their job.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.347
You don't forget your job.
How long you been waiting here?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.582
Uh, maybe ten minutes.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.484
Ten mi--
ten minutes?

13:04.517 --> 13:05.853
- Dude, it's--
- That is ridiculous.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.354
No, it's--

13:07.387 --> 13:08.956
Did you have to take off work
to come here?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.523
I was just rapping
a little bit, but it's cool.

13:10.557 --> 13:11.825
See, that's
precious writing time.

13:11.859 --> 13:12.993
You're an artist.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.695
Unbelievable.
Brenda, will you--

13:15.728 --> 13:17.197
[clears throat]
Brenda, will you come here
for a second?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.631
No, hey, Brenda,
stay where you at.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.700
Hey, look, your guy asked me
for a autograph

13:20.733 --> 13:22.369
- the last time in the house.
- Mm-hmm.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.938
So make sure you give him
this autograph for me, okay?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.273
[breathes deeply]

13:26.306 --> 13:29.342
Just keep it cool.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.044
And, look, I know your girl

13:31.078 --> 13:33.513
don't want me using
my battle scar in my rap,

13:33.546 --> 13:35.315
but I can't stop people

13:35.348 --> 13:37.350
from drawing
their own conclusions, right?

13:37.384 --> 13:39.619
Yeah. Hey, man, you got to do
what you have to do.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.854
I'm gonna do it.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.355
Good.
And take care of that leg.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.125
I swear to God I will.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.494
Damn it.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.462
Brenda, will you come here
for a second?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.463
(Brenda)
Coming.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.965
He a gangster.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.401
"Keep rockin'
that crazy Elvis hair.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.468
Styfl."

13:55.502 --> 13:57.137
This is awesome.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.405
- You know what I was thinking?
- Oh, here we go.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.372
I was thinking
we need to revive

13:59.406 --> 14:00.974
the old Med Mobile program.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.209
- Mm-hmm, of course you were.
- What is it?

14:02.242 --> 14:04.011
It's this service
we used to offer

14:04.044 --> 14:05.412
where we take the ambulance
into a rough neighborhood

14:05.445 --> 14:07.147
and give basic medical care,
usually flu shots,

14:07.180 --> 14:08.681
but people
really appreciated it.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.650
You're really not
gonna let this go, are you?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.319
Why did they get rid of
the program in the first place?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.654
Because nobody wanted to work
on the weekend for free,

14:14.687 --> 14:16.890
including this guy,
especially this guy.

14:16.924 --> 14:17.991
[chuckles]
I was young.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.426
It was two years ago.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.760
This Saturday,
we're gonna do it.

14:20.793 --> 14:21.728
- I'm in.
- I'm out.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.096
Come on, Hank.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.365
Look, the weekend is my time
to regroup,

14:25.398 --> 14:27.167
so I can
come back Monday refreshed.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.568
You're gonna spend the weekend
boning my landlord.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.837
How I refresh
is my business.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.940
So selfish.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.208
I'm not selfish.
I need me and Nick time.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.110
Superman
need Lois Lane time.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.878
Batman
needs Robin time.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.447
Or wait.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.083
- Does Batman need Alfred time?
- Mm.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.786
Or maybe Robin
needs Batman time.

14:46.819 --> 14:49.456
Maybe Alfred
needs Batman and Robin time.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.963
[car horn honks]

14:55.996 --> 14:58.598
- Fifth text, no response.
- He said he wasn't coming.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.401
Still, so selfish.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.435
I'm sure
he has his reasons.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.804
Yeah.
Whatever.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.477
(Nick)
Okay, full disclosure--
the basil is from my garden,

15:10.510 --> 15:13.113
but the tomatoes,
unfortunately, are not.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.448
My friend Teddy
brought them in from his farm

15:15.482 --> 15:17.217
in Wisconsin.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.419
Mmm.
So goddamn good.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.420
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.122
So what do you think?

15:22.155 --> 15:24.457
Just stay in bed all day,
do absolutely nothing?

15:24.491 --> 15:25.959
Well, that sounds awesome.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.727
How could I ever
pass up all this

15:27.760 --> 15:29.162
to go into work?

15:29.196 --> 15:30.497
You're supposed
to work today?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.165
Johnny wants me to do
this volunteer shift

15:32.199 --> 15:34.267
in some bad neighborhood
on the West Side.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.503
That's awesome.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.738
It is so cool
that you do stuff like that.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.307
N-no, it isn't.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.142
I mean, I did my six weeks
in Haiti, of course,

15:42.175 --> 15:44.144
but you--you get to do
this kind of stuff every day.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.745
Mm-hmm.
And that's why I need a weekend.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.614
Oh.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.316
No, you'll feel like shit
if you don't go in.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.285
[gasps]
I'll pack you a bento box.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.187
- But wait.
- No, no, no.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.123
I make a great bento box.
It's from Hokkaido.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.524
Hokkaido?
Who--

15:57.557 --> 15:58.992
Don't nobody want
no Hokkaido bento box.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.627
No.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.996
[sighs]

16:06.133 --> 16:07.334
It'll just be real quick,
all right?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.701
You'll barely notice it.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.671
[sighs]

16:14.141 --> 16:15.708
I knew you'd show.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.210
- [laughing]
- We're not the two amigos.

16:17.244 --> 16:20.847
We're the three amigos--
one, two, and three.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.483
You two are interchangeable
as one and two, and I'm three.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.717
- All right, nice turnout.
- Strap on some gloves.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.619
Not even gonna ask you

16:26.653 --> 16:28.221
about that ridiculous
lunch-box thing you've got.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.689
- It's a--
- Nope.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.658
Glad you're here.
Ready, Shawn?

16:31.691 --> 16:34.994
Look at me.
One, two...

16:35.028 --> 16:37.397
- Done.
- Look at that.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.698
That didn't hurt too bad,
now, did it?

16:38.731 --> 16:40.133
Yeah, man.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.569
It's a shot.
Shots hurt.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.571
Well, I guess
they do.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.339
Man,
I don't want that.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.707
Why not?

16:47.740 --> 16:49.809
How old do you think
I am, bitch?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.544
(Shawn's mom)
Shawn, be respectful.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.013
Take the balloon
for your sister.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.582
[sighs]

16:55.615 --> 16:57.250
[chuckles]

16:57.284 --> 16:58.485
Hey.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.819
How's it going?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.588
- It's going really good.
- Good.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.022
- Mr. Farrell.
- Yeah.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.557
I just wanted
to personally shake your hand

17:04.591 --> 17:05.858
for the work you're doing
here today.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.228
Oh.
Oh, yeah, glad to do it.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.496
It's--
You know, it's nothing.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
Oh, it's something.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.066
Wasn't too long ago we couldn't
get anyone to come out here.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.201
Well done, young man.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.503
Oh.
Thanks.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.371
Someone's getting
a little bit of love.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.408
Oh, it ain't
about that.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.510
Isn't it?

17:23.543 --> 17:25.312
- It's a little about that.
- [chuckles]

17:29.482 --> 17:31.118
Oof.

17:31.151 --> 17:34.354
- Café con leche.
- Oh, gracias.

17:34.387 --> 17:38.358
Oh.
Nice.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.627
Those guys are doing something
really special back there.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.895
It's inspirational.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.864
Yeah, but if you think about it,
we had a little hand in it too

17:44.897 --> 17:46.899
when we got Bootsie and LaVon
off that block.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.402
A year ago you wouldn't want
to step into that parking lot.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.703
(both)
Have to pay a toll!

17:50.737 --> 17:52.239
[chuckles]

17:52.272 --> 17:53.706
Yeah.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.041
Has it been a year?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.976
Yeah, I think so.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.812
Yeah, 'cause
I just became your partner,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.381
and I wasn't comfortable enough
to tell you

18:01.414 --> 18:03.283
I had to take a shit,
so I didn't.

18:03.316 --> 18:06.486
And then we were driving around,
and then we saw them.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.988
And I was like, "Man, we really
got to arrest those dudes,

18:09.021 --> 18:10.323
"but I really
got to do something

18:10.357 --> 18:12.792
that I can't tell her about
right now."

18:12.825 --> 18:14.494
Let's just say
that my mind was elsewhere

18:14.527 --> 18:16.129
when we were reading them
their rights.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.598
That is both gross
and sweet.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.567
- How much time did they get?
- I don't know.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.669
(man on radio)
Chicago West,
robbery in progress,

18:22.702 --> 18:25.104
St. Jerome's Church,
Kinzie and Garfield.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.139
Ah, hell.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.707
Oh, shit.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.530
Ah.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.266
Who?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.967
Bootsie and LaVon.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.704
Aren't you guys
gonna help?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.372
I'm not talking
to you.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.341
I'm eating my bento.

19:09.816 --> 19:10.983
(Mac)
When I said you could revive
the Med Mobile program,

19:11.017 --> 19:12.151
I did not give you license
to park the rig

19:12.185 --> 19:13.353
in the middle of the shit.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.454
You go to the outskirts
of the shit,

19:14.487 --> 19:16.022
shit adjacent.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.558
You guys were smack-dab
in the middle of the shit,

19:18.591 --> 19:19.492
in the goddamn eye
of the shit.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.860
It was my fault.

19:20.893 --> 19:21.794
I convinced these guys
to go out.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.129
It was a bad idea.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.364
You're damn right
it was a bad idea.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.698
You're lucky
you didn't die.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.667
Look, I'll reimburse
the company

19:27.700 --> 19:30.069
for everything that was stolen
out of the rig.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.704
- Are you a moron?
- What?

19:31.738 --> 19:34.241
Do you have any idea how much
that equipment is worth?

19:34.274 --> 19:36.042
(Johnny)
Right. Okay.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.710
I'll be really sorry
for what I did,

19:37.744 --> 19:39.379
and, you know,
I'll bring...

19:39.412 --> 19:40.347
- Bagels...
- Every...

19:40.380 --> 19:41.381
- Monday...
- For...

19:41.414 --> 19:42.815
- Ever.
- [sighs] Yeah.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.083
- That's fair.
- That's fair.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.652
- Okay, good.
- That's fair.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.554
In our defense, up until
the point we got robbed,

19:47.587 --> 19:49.055
we made a big impact
out there.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.723
I like impact.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.492
You guys are in rig 8
until yours gets back.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.426
Now get out.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.265
Oh, it's Monday.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.066
Everything bagel,
salmon schmear.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.534
Everything bagel,
salmon schmear.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.902
- You got it.
- Toasted?

20:02.935 --> 20:04.337
- Okay.
- Orange juice?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.538
- Fine.
- Coffee? I mean, we're there--

20:05.572 --> 20:07.774
- Get out.
- Okay.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.242
(Johnny)
The steering
on this thing is shit.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.843
Rig 8 sucks.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.112
This bucket seat
feels like an actual bucket.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.013
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.114
Hmm.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.549
You know, Cash was right.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.251
We don't get the respect
we deserve,

20:18.285 --> 20:19.686
but it doesn't make what we do
any less worthwhile.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.721
You're right.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.290

Ambulance requested.

Yep.
