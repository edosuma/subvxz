"Better Now" by Post Malone.

for you.

right down your lane.

are better now, better now *

I love Post. He's one of
my biggest influences.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.533
I knew that I needed
to take this song

04:01.574 --> 04:03.410
and kind of flip it
and not sing it just like him

04:03.451 --> 04:05.328
being that
we are a little bit similar.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.914
* Drinkin' Henny
and I'm tryna forget *

04:07.956 --> 04:11.167
It talks about an unhealthy,
painful relationship,

04:11.209 --> 04:13.670

of how thankful I am being

04:13.712 --> 04:15.797

for over 10 years.

* Never let you down,

Bodie can dip in and out of,
like, R&B, pop, and rap,

04:39.404 --> 04:40.697
and it just works.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.907
I'm like,
"Oh, I'm definitely going home."

04:42.949 --> 04:45.702

I gonna go home and cry.

When did you say you came up
with this arrangement, the flip?

04:55.420 --> 04:58.131
The night before rehearsal.
Okay, 'cause it feels

04:58.173 --> 05:00.050
like it's still new
to you.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.718
Yes.
The idea is there,

05:01.760 --> 05:04.637
but you just don't have it
totally dialed in yet.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.598
Blake: Bodie shows me
with each performance

05:06.639 --> 05:08.475
that he's a producer.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.602
He's a writer.
He's very creative.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.270
And that's what I love
about the knockouts.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.480
These artists are coming in

05:13.521 --> 05:15.190
with their own songs
that they picked.

05:15.231 --> 05:19.694
And just like Bodie always does,
he's -- he's taken this song

05:19.736 --> 05:21.821
and he's definitely
making it his own.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.491
Whatever you decide
to flip and -- and change,

05:24.532 --> 05:26.034
please know it as well
as you already know

05:26.076 --> 05:27.702
the Post Malone version
of it.
Okay.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.497
Because the potential's there
for it to be incredible

05:30.538 --> 05:31.831
and -- and blow people away,

05:31.873 --> 05:34.042
but right now it still feels
like it's incomplete.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.585
Should I just sing it straight
the first verse?

05:35.627 --> 05:36.961
Yeah.
Okay.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.713
Maybe it was the fact
that I was singing

05:38.755 --> 05:40.131
five feet away
from Blake Shelton.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.716
He was sitting in
his little director's chair...

05:41.758 --> 05:43.176
Thanks, Blake.
Yeah, buddy.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.678
...but I was definitely
a little bit more nervous

05:44.719 --> 05:45.929
than I normally
would have been.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.639
I just kind of felt
underprepared.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.558
And ultimately, that was
the one note he gave me.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.019
He didn't like it.

be doing, Kevin?

05:54.896 --> 05:57.691

Work" by Kate Bush,

Blake: I was kind of
looking at the floor
when he started singing,

06:07.534 --> 06:10.036
and I was completely shocked
by what I heard.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.454
My God.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.208
Came right in in his falsetto
singing way up there.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.209
And he just stayed there.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.712
* Father... *

06:18.753 --> 06:21.339
This song is a shout-out
to my mom

06:21.381 --> 06:22.632
and both my grandmothers.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.134
All of them work hard.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.137
My grandmother, she is 94.

06:27.178 --> 06:30.390
She's seen how the world
has transitioned --

06:30.432 --> 06:32.726
women's rights, civil rights --

06:32.767 --> 06:35.937
the things that I hold
near and dear to my heart.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.732
* Ah, whoo *

06:38.773 --> 06:41.526
So that's why I connect
to this song so much.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.028
Wow!
[ Cheers and applause ]

06:43.069 --> 06:45.238
Come on, Kev!
Will you tell
the other coaches

06:45.280 --> 06:47.032
that you didn't have a plan
and I talked to you

06:47.073 --> 06:49.034
into doing the falsetto thing?
[ Laughs ]

06:49.075 --> 06:52.912
It's completely different.
That element alone is exciting.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.081
Part of me thinks
it's too much falsetto,

06:55.123 --> 06:57.834
but then every time
you would do, like, a
thing and it was like,

06:57.876 --> 06:59.544
"Whoa, no, no, no.
It's so good."
Yeah.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.088
* Of the father... *

07:02.130 --> 07:04.716
I'd say if there's more spots
where you can step out

07:04.758 --> 07:07.761
of just staying
in that one spot,

07:07.802 --> 07:10.180
because the amazingness starts
to wear off of it

07:10.221 --> 07:11.890
until you do
a thing again.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.059
Would you like me to drop
into my chest?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.602
I think so.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.396

praying that, like,

07:21.483 --> 07:23.234

Double steal, maybe?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.402
Oh, Lord.

to decide

who their favorites are.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.407
Even though they're
not voting yet,

07:29.449 --> 07:30.950
it's time
to start standing out.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.328
I'll work on it, for sure.
Yeah. Cool. Alright.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.871
You two ready?
Yeah.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.374
What's guitar man gonna do
out here without a guitar?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.292

a cool thing?

when your wine's all gone *

07:42.796 --> 07:46.716

that I've put down the guitar.

* But I know, yeah, I know
it's a matter of time *

07:59.688 --> 08:03.191
There's no barrier.
I'll just say that much.
We're literally like this.
We're one on one.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.236
When Gwen and I first started
singing "Nobody But You"...

08:06.277 --> 08:09.072
I love that song.
...together, I would
play guitar on it, you know?

08:09.114 --> 08:10.699
And we even did it
on the Grammys.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.825
And I just wasn't
singing it that good.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.076
I wanted to, like, lean in,

08:13.118 --> 08:14.869
so I'll finally ditched
the guitar.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.497
* But I know, yeah, I know
it's a matter of time *

08:17.539 --> 08:18.998
The first time Derek and I
sang together,

08:19.040 --> 08:20.917
we had
just started dating.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.877
Someone in his family
passed away,

08:22.919 --> 08:25.338
and they were like,
"Can you sing in the funeral?"

08:25.380 --> 08:28.925
We performed the song,
and then when we got done,

08:28.967 --> 08:30.510
we were like,
"That was really --

08:30.552 --> 08:32.846
Like, we sound good together."
And it's been like that since.

08:32.887 --> 08:36.683
* Don't know why, don't know why
I let you, but I do *

08:36.725 --> 08:38.184
Blake: This is right in
their wheelhouse.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.854
I mean, they couldn't have
chosen a better song

08:40.895 --> 08:43.481
that's just a layup
for what they do.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.901

08:51.239 --> 08:53.283
You also blow
the roof off the place.
Yes!

08:53.324 --> 08:55.702
A pleasant surprise for me
in this moment

08:55.744 --> 08:59.831
is that Derek
is a <i>way</i>better singer

08:59.873 --> 09:02.042
than I ever
gave him credit for.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.085
It's a different mind-set
once I put down the guitar,

09:04.127 --> 09:05.754
apparently.
Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

when the guitar goes off.

[ Laughter ]

09:09.007 --> 09:11.509
The one thing I would say
is your verse,

09:11.551 --> 09:13.178
maybe there's
some melody tweaks

09:13.219 --> 09:16.056
to help you not be
so far down there in the mud.
So low.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.642
But, man, when you guys
sing together? Oh, my gosh.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.729
The Dryes have
some sick harmonies.

09:22.771 --> 09:23.980
Well, come on up here.

09:24.022 --> 09:27.067
And those two combined
are dangerous.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.568
Blake:
It's really good news to know

09:28.610 --> 09:29.903
that everybody
can be stolen here.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.363
It's gonna suck for me,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.073
but it's gonna be great
for you guys, so...

09:33.114 --> 09:35.492
These three artists
are so talented,

09:35.533 --> 09:36.993
but they're all so different.

I'm gonna make this decision.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.381
but it felt just
a little bit disjointed

18:51.423 --> 18:52.674
because you were going
between your false

18:52.716 --> 18:54.718
and your chest voice
so much.

18:54.759 --> 18:58.221
The Dryes, that low baritone,
you just rocked it.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.056
Sexy!
Yeah.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.934
Appreciate it. Yep.
Exactly. It was, like, sexy
and assured and confident,

19:02.976 --> 19:05.603
and it just felt like
the exact right choice

19:05.645 --> 19:07.397
in this high-stakes moment

19:07.439 --> 19:09.399
to say we deserve to be
in the lives.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.067
Daly: Thank you, Coaches.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.570
Blake, give us some thoughts
on that three-way knockout.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.114
It stings a little bit
to hear what John said,

19:16.156 --> 19:17.198
which he's not wrong.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.992
He's -- He's John Legend.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.618
So...
I could be wrong.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.997
...in rehearsal,
Kevin was probably 80%

19:24.039 --> 19:26.750
in the falsetto,
and I'm the one that said,

19:26.791 --> 19:29.461
"Hey, man, give me some more
of the full voice."

19:29.502 --> 19:31.504
I take responsibility.
That's why that happened.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.007
[ Cheers and applause ]
Thank you. I'm a great man.
I'm a great man.

responsibility!

19:35.967 --> 19:38.762
Great coach and man.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.431
And then The Dryes...
What's up, brother?

19:41.473 --> 19:42.932
...this guy who's been

19:42.974 --> 19:46.144
the guitar-player
supporting role in the duo

19:46.186 --> 19:48.104
stepped up
and sang like that.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.690
It's like, what the hell?
Where have you been
hiding all this time?

19:50.732 --> 19:53.443
And then you guys hear
what Katelyn does.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.028
She's unbelievable,

19:55.070 --> 19:57.947
and her range is what I said
it was gonna be.

19:57.989 --> 20:01.701
And then Bodie, I don't think
we've ever seen an artist

20:01.743 --> 20:03.203
quite like you
on this show.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.913
What you're doing live
in the moment

20:04.954 --> 20:07.582
sounds like somebody who's
been jacked with in the studio,

20:07.624 --> 20:08.792
but you do it all alive.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.919
That's what blows us away,
I think.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.962
[ Robotically ]
Are you a robot, Bodie?
Yeah. How do you do that?

20:13.004 --> 20:16.716
It's crazy. And the way you
connect with a song.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.719
It's -- I quit.
I'm quitting the show right now.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.846
After 22 seasons.
Yeah, I know.
You guys broke me.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.515
Give it up for Blake Shelton.
Thank you, Blake.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.141
You three broke me!
I quit!

20:25.183 --> 20:26.643
Bye-bye.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.812
Bye-bye.
It's been a great run.
It's been a great run.

Blake, who do you think
won this knockout?

[ Chuckles ]

20:33.483 --> 20:39.906

20:39.948 --> 20:41.783
Winner of this knockout
is Bodie.

[ Cheers and applause ]
Daly: Bodie, congratulations!

20:44.869 --> 20:47.205
You are moving on
to the live playoffs!

20:47.247 --> 20:51.167
I tell you, I did not make
these three-way knockouts easy.

20:51.209 --> 20:52.419
Happy for you.
Thank you.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.087
Yes, sir.
But at the end of the day,

20:54.129 --> 20:57.340
Bodie just has something really
special about what he does.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.342
There's nobody like Bodie
on the show,

20:59.384 --> 21:01.094
and he's on Team Blake.

21:01.136 --> 21:03.680
Alright. That leaves these two
artists available to steal.

21:03.722 --> 21:06.474
So we're gonna talk
to each of you one by one.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.018
Anything you guys
want to say to Blake?

21:08.059 --> 21:10.353
This opportunity
has been amazing

21:10.395 --> 21:12.147
for the both of us,
and...

21:12.188 --> 21:13.940
we're not gonna stop
what we're doing, you know?

21:13.982 --> 21:16.026
We're gonna keep
doing The Dryes.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.028
Thank you guys
so much.
Thanks.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.529
Fantastic.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.948
For the live playoffs, I'm
hoping to build a team of people

21:21.990 --> 21:24.576
that give
really exciting performances

21:24.617 --> 21:26.786
and this was
a really great performance,

21:26.828 --> 21:28.872
but I didn't steal The Dryes

21:28.913 --> 21:32.751
because I haven't consistently
seen them wow me.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.669
Kevin, anything you want
to say to Blake?

21:34.711 --> 21:38.048
Blake, thank you
for this moment.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.924
I will never take it for granted
for the rest of my life,

21:39.966 --> 21:41.718
and I'm going to keep going
no matter what happens.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.219
So, thank you.
You have to!

21:43.261 --> 21:44.554

Oh, my God!
I impulse did it.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.534
I could not see you walk out
of this show.
I did, too!

22:06.576 --> 22:09.579
Your performance for me
was flawless.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.623

about your style...

be great together.

a crazy star power.

When you sing something and I
feel something in my heart,

22:22.550 --> 22:24.135
I can't let somebody
like that go

22:24.177 --> 22:26.304
'cause I like people
that are the whole package.

and I didn't even get him then.

over his voice.

that Kevin

little moments of love,

you're going, "Okay.
I needed that. Thank you."

a different side of her voice.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.708
It's more soulful.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.335
It just shows the versatility

26:25.377 --> 26:27.545
she has as an artist
and as a singer.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.964
Whoo!
That is gorgeous.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.716
How did that feel
for you?

26:31.758 --> 26:32.884
Good.
I just get nervous.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.219
Yeah, that's --
that's normal.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.179
And also, without the energy
of the crowd,

26:36.221 --> 26:38.807
which I feel like is something
that you really thrive off.
Mm-hmm. I feed off.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.058
Yes, I do.

26:40.100 --> 26:43.895
Once the crowd is there,
you're like, "Yeah!"

Watching Morgan rehearse,

26:45.480 --> 26:48.733
my arm was immediately like,
boom, goosebumps.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.569
So it's gonna be
a challenge for sure.

26:51.611 --> 26:57.075
Visually, you want to be focused
on everything being executed

26:57.117 --> 27:00.078
in a way
that exudes confidence.
Confidence.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.454

can go into like

27:01.496 --> 27:02.539
these moments and like...

27:02.580 --> 27:03.832
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

27:03.873 --> 27:06.334
Like, more into
mike stand moments of just

27:06.376 --> 27:08.378
like this stuff and like --
Do you know what I mean?
Yes. Yes.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.380
Like, really getting
into that, because the more

27:10.422 --> 27:15.218
that you match the diva emotion
of your voice...
With my body.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.595
...I think it'll make it
a masterful performance.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.140
I think for this knockout
to make it to the live shows,

27:20.181 --> 27:21.933
I could tell that
she was more nervous today

27:21.975 --> 27:23.727
than I've seen her before.

27:23.768 --> 27:26.104
Practice in front of the mirror
like 10 times and then...
Yep. I agree.

27:26.146 --> 27:27.772
...like, just be
weird and be you,

27:27.814 --> 27:30.316
which you already
are weird and you.
Yes, yes. Very true.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.277
What I really love
about Camila,

27:32.318 --> 27:35.030
she understands
where we're coming from.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.490
I got some mental health
hacks for you.

27:37.532 --> 27:39.576
It was just fun
having a real heart to heart.

27:39.617 --> 27:43.204
I was like, "Yes, girl."
I need that feedback, you know?

27:43.246 --> 27:45.290
Chelly, Chelly, Chelly.
What's up?

27:45.331 --> 27:47.167
Oh!
Ooh, what's this?

27:47.208 --> 27:48.668
What is that?
Oh, I just had this,
you know.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.712
Have I ever
seen you play guitar?

27:50.754 --> 27:53.048
I don't think you have.
What song are you singing?

27:53.089 --> 27:54.507
"Hold On"
by Justin Bieber.

27:54.549 --> 27:57.093
This song in particular
I think is something I would

27:57.135 --> 27:59.387
more aspire to align with,
like, artistically.

27:59.429 --> 28:01.473
Oh.
The song he auditioned with...

28:01.514 --> 28:07.312
* Just the two of us,
we can make it if we tried *

28:07.354 --> 28:10.398
...to the song he's doing now
could not be more different.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.192
I think such
a big part of Chello

28:12.233 --> 28:14.319
is the way he expresses
himself through his body.

28:14.361 --> 28:17.655
But I think playing guitar could
also be a fun chance for him

28:17.697 --> 28:20.742
to just focus
on the delivery of his voice.

28:20.784 --> 28:24.329
* Midnight till morning,
call if you need somebody *

28:24.371 --> 28:26.456
* I will be there for you *
Hey!

28:26.498 --> 28:28.333
There's a lot of themes of,
like,

28:28.375 --> 28:30.043
selflessness
throughout this song.

28:30.085 --> 28:31.920
Like, you know you can call me
if you need someone.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.005
The person that acted
that way for me

28:34.047 --> 28:35.548
was definitely my grandma.

28:35.590 --> 28:39.219
My grandma became my babysitter
since I was like five.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.346
Woman: <i>Hearing your little</i>
<i>feet coming down the steps</i>

28:41.388 --> 28:44.516
<i>was the highlight of my day,</i>
<i>knowing you were around.</i>

28:44.557 --> 28:47.394
Growing up, my grandma really
was kind of my best friend.

28:47.435 --> 28:50.438
Grandma, are you gonna
spin your chair for me?

28:50.480 --> 28:52.107
[ Laughs ]

28:52.148 --> 28:57.320
* Hold on, tell me everything
that you need to say *
Whoo!

28:57.362 --> 29:01.116
I love that you went
for versatility on this.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.827
That rhythmic section
sounds so good on you.

29:03.868 --> 29:05.286
* Midnight till morning *

29:05.328 --> 29:07.163
You don't need to be
trying

29:07.205 --> 29:11.501
to do all of these
long high belting notes

29:11.543 --> 29:12.836
because that's not

29:12.877 --> 29:15.880
why I gravitated towards you
as an artist.

29:15.922 --> 29:16.881
Like, be Chello.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.299
I lower keys
all the time,

29:18.341 --> 29:20.051
and it's not because
I can't reach the notes,

29:20.093 --> 29:23.013
but because maybe my voice
just sounds more pleasant.

29:23.054 --> 29:25.223
Right.
Do you want to try it
down a half step?

29:25.265 --> 29:27.392
Sure.
* If you need someone *

29:27.434 --> 29:28.268
Whoo-hoo!

29:28.309 --> 29:29.644
Orlando: Chello is a vibe.

29:29.686 --> 29:31.312
He's got a great personality

29:31.354 --> 29:35.066
and then he's got this voice
which just screams like popstar.

29:35.108 --> 29:36.443
Wasn't that way better?

29:36.484 --> 29:39.154
Sounds awesome. Yeah.
Like, you sound so sultry.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.906
I feel like the stakes
are definitely getting higher.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.783
This knockout round
is gonna be tough.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.536
Camila: Yay!
Get up here right now.

29:46.578 --> 29:49.664
This would be the end
for a lot of us. It's on.

29:49.706 --> 29:51.916
Daly: Still to come in
the premiere of the knockouts...

29:51.958 --> 29:54.919
* What the world needs now *
...the artists step it up

29:54.961 --> 29:56.713
for a shot
at the live playoffs...

29:56.755 --> 29:58.590
* I went skydivin' **

29:58.631 --> 30:00.592
* I was just *

30:00.633 --> 30:03.803
Yeah!
* I was just
sittin' here thinking *

30:03.845 --> 30:06.681
Yes!
What the hell?

30:06.723 --> 30:08.475
I felt like a star was born.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.101
Daly: ...leading to
gut-wrenching decisions

30:10.143 --> 30:11.353
for our coaches.

30:11.394 --> 30:13.021
Carson,
this is really hard.

30:13.063 --> 30:15.607
This is a very,
very tough decision.

30:16.149 --> 30:18.026
Yes!
Daly: We've got a steal!

30:24.324 --> 30:25.742
* This is "The Voice" *

30:25.784 --> 30:27.535
Daly: Welcome back.

30:27.577 --> 30:29.621
What are you singing?
What's up?

30:29.662 --> 30:32.749
So I'm singing "Live Like
You Were Dying" by Tim McGraw.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.542
Wow,
I love these lyrics!

30:34.584 --> 30:38.171
* He said,
"I was in my early 40s *

30:38.213 --> 30:40.674
* With a lot of life
before me" *

30:40.715 --> 30:43.385
Recently, this song has
a different meaning to me.

30:43.426 --> 30:46.846
I, uh -- I lost my uncle
about three weeks ago.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.515
I'm so sorry,
Orlando.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.101
I just want to do this song
as -- as a tribute to him.

30:51.142 --> 30:54.521
My uncle was one of my biggest
inspirations to be a singer.

30:54.562 --> 30:57.273
He studied music in college.
He always played piano.

30:57.315 --> 30:59.442
He wanted to hear every detail
about every gig.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.695
And then when I finally got
the opportunity to come out here

31:01.736 --> 31:03.613
for "The Voice,"
he was in a bad spot.

31:03.655 --> 31:05.865
He spent a couple days
without even opening his eyes.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.660
And I remember when they put
the phone in front of him

31:08.702 --> 31:12.288
and told him
I had turned four chairs,

31:12.330 --> 31:14.290
he opened his eyes [chuckles]

31:14.332 --> 31:16.042
and he started smiling.

31:16.084 --> 31:19.045
**

31:19.087 --> 31:21.089
And, um...

31:21.131 --> 31:23.466
and a tear rolled down his face.

31:23.508 --> 31:26.302
**

31:26.344 --> 31:28.930
My uncle perfectly embodied
what this song is about.

31:28.972 --> 31:32.475
If we focused a little more
on the beautiful parts of life,

31:32.517 --> 31:36.229
appreciating every day, man,
how much happier we would be?

31:36.271 --> 31:40.191
* I went skydivin',
I went... *

31:40.233 --> 31:43.111
Orlando has such
a swagger to his voice,

31:43.153 --> 31:44.821
and he's also so emotional.

31:44.863 --> 31:47.782
He's the whole package, too,
in terms of performing.

31:47.824 --> 31:48.950
Hey!

31:48.992 --> 31:52.579
* To live like you were dying *

31:52.620 --> 31:53.788
Whoo!

31:53.830 --> 31:56.207
Whoo!
Ooh! Orlando!

31:56.249 --> 31:57.417
Ow!
Wow.

31:57.459 --> 31:59.586
Aw, come here, bro.
[ Chuckles ]

31:59.627 --> 32:02.130
Mmm!

32:02.172 --> 32:05.258
I know it takes a lot
to sing this song.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.676
I've had a song
about my dad,

32:06.718 --> 32:09.554
and I literally could not
sing it without crying.

32:09.596 --> 32:13.475
I mean, the weight of
that emotion is driving you.

32:13.516 --> 32:15.435
For sure.
It's powerful.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.771
If there's a note where you can
go into that -- a falsetto,

32:17.812 --> 32:19.272
I feel like that would be cool.
Like the...

32:19.314 --> 32:20.732
* Dying *

32:20.774 --> 32:22.442
* Dying *

32:22.484 --> 32:25.779
Yeah, that. I think is such
a special thing that you can do.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.864
Appreciate it.
Being vulnerable
and sharing that,

32:27.906 --> 32:29.282
like, through these words.

32:29.324 --> 32:30.367
It's looking like this
is gonna be Orlando's

32:30.408 --> 32:32.452
strongest performance.

32:32.494 --> 32:35.288
He really is pouring his heart
into this song.

32:35.330 --> 32:36.664
This is gonna be
really beautiful.

32:36.706 --> 32:38.208
I can't wait.
I think it's gonna make

32:38.249 --> 32:39.626
for a really
special performance.

32:39.668 --> 32:40.919
Thank you so much.
Yay! Group hug!

32:40.960 --> 32:43.463
Guys, I'm really excited.
You're the best!

32:43.505 --> 32:44.964
Only one out of three
are gonna make it

32:45.006 --> 32:46.675
through to the live shows.

32:46.716 --> 32:48.760
I'm looking for unique
stand-out artists.

32:48.802 --> 32:52.305
I want just firecracker
performances.
Bye, guys.

32:52.347 --> 32:53.640
Thank you! Bye!
Thank you so much.

32:53.682 --> 32:55.433
I think it's gonna be
a tough decision.

this Team Camila knockout,

33:02.649 --> 33:04.109
Chello:
The more you move forward,

33:04.150 --> 33:06.695
the higher the pressure
and I could get sent home.

33:06.736 --> 33:08.905
I definitely want to stay here.

would be huge.

"I was in my early 40s *

* With a lot of life before me *

* When a moment came
that stopped me on a dime" *

39:02.092 --> 39:05.136
* That this might
really be the real end *

* "Man, what ya do?" *

* And I gave forgiveness
I've been denying" *

you get the chance *

40:46.863 --> 40:48.323
It's really fun to see

40:48.365 --> 40:50.325
what you produced here
with your coaching.

40:50.367 --> 40:52.535
Well, I mean, really,
it was them,

40:52.577 --> 40:53.620

Look how proud she is.

It's so cute.
So cute.

40:56.956 --> 40:59.542
Chello, such a different
performance from the last.

40:59.584 --> 41:02.087
I think that, once in a while,
there were some tuning stuff,

41:02.128 --> 41:03.588
but I thought it was
a really smart choice

41:03.630 --> 41:05.131
to do a song like that,

41:05.173 --> 41:07.133
to just show like
a different side to you.
Thank you.

41:07.175 --> 41:10.095
Morgan,
I got blocked by Camila,

41:10.136 --> 41:11.846
so I didn't get you
on my team.

41:11.888 --> 41:14.683
But this is my chance to coach
you for a minute, right?
What?

41:14.724 --> 41:16.351
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a little bit, right?

41:16.393 --> 41:19.270
You are incredible on stage
with your presence.

41:19.312 --> 41:22.273
Some of the movements,
it was like every lyric,

41:22.315 --> 41:25.193
and it goes a little pageant-y,
which you're not.

41:25.235 --> 41:27.529
Orlando,
I really liked that performance.

41:27.570 --> 41:30.949
I really believed the lyrics
through your facial expressions.

41:30.990 --> 41:32.951
You're not faking it.
Thank you so much.

41:32.992 --> 41:35.120
Orlando's stole this knockout
for me.

Chello, I really love
this type of song for you.

41:42.168 --> 41:44.546
Your vocal performance
was really disciplined,

41:44.587 --> 41:46.172
and I felt like overall

41:46.214 --> 41:48.466
it's been my favorite
performance of yours.
Thank you.

41:48.508 --> 41:54.264
Orlando, you seemed so
in your element, so passionate.

41:54.305 --> 41:56.016
It could have been
a little "singy-er."

41:56.057 --> 41:57.434
And that's just my taste.

41:57.475 --> 42:00.395
I'm like an R&B crooner,
so I like a little croon.

42:01.855 --> 42:03.648
And it felt like
you were almost pushing it

42:03.690 --> 42:05.108
a little too much
with the yell,

42:05.150 --> 42:07.736
but, uh, I was willing
to forgive that anyway.

42:07.777 --> 42:09.070
It just felt like
you were doing

42:09.112 --> 42:10.405
what you were
supposed to be doing.

42:10.447 --> 42:11.531
Thank you so much, John.

42:11.573 --> 42:12.907
Yeah, I feel similar.

42:12.949 --> 42:15.702
Orlando went a little
Nicolas Cage there

42:15.744 --> 42:17.120
towards the end,
didn't he?

42:17.162 --> 42:18.663

What does that mean?

42:18.705 --> 42:20.915
You ever seen Nicolas Cage
scream in his movies?

He's, "Aaaaah!"
That's what he was going for.

42:23.918 --> 42:27.213
But listening to the message
of the song,

42:27.255 --> 42:29.966
I mean, you were definitely
giving it everything you had.

42:30.008 --> 42:31.259
It was damn good,

42:31.301 --> 42:33.053
even though you passed on me
as your coach.

is wrong with you?

No.

vocally was --

42:46.941 --> 42:48.777
Very strong.
It was incredible.

42:48.818 --> 42:51.279
I just think that
if the world needs love,

42:51.321 --> 42:53.031
there was a lot
of tough love.

42:53.073 --> 42:54.324
The world needs
some tough love

42:54.366 --> 42:55.909
is what you were
giving us, I guess.

it's between Morgan and Orlando,

43:02.290 --> 43:04.292
and I don't know --
what the hell, just to make it

43:04.334 --> 43:07.212
more complicated,
I'm gonna go with Morgan.

43:07.253 --> 43:09.631
Alright, Camila, give us
some thoughts on that knockout

43:09.673 --> 43:11.132
and then tell us
who won.

Orlando, this song has
a special meaning for him,

43:14.511 --> 43:16.888

because they don't even know

43:16.930 --> 43:18.390
what you were thinking of,

on this visceral connection.

beat myself up a little bit.

When you were giving
the big hand gestures

43:33.321 --> 43:35.532
and -- and --
and punching the air,

43:35.573 --> 43:39.035
I might have led her astray
in that way because that was me.

I told her to do that.

a long way with that.

it was all bad.

the winner of this knockout?

44:16.906 --> 44:18.241
Okay.

very tough decision.

close, close call.

is Morgan.

did their best

killed it,

to go with Morgan.

There's nothing she can't do,

44:57.489 --> 45:00.241

she could win this season.

I thought Orlando gave the best
performance during this round,

has been consistently

a better performer

45:49.499 --> 45:51.334
I had a little feeling
it was gonna be Valarie,

45:51.376 --> 45:54.504
because we both have, like, kind
of a similar genre of music.

that I was capable of singing

amazing singers.

We had an adviser, uh,
in the battle rounds,

46:14.691 --> 46:17.193
but this is so important to me
that I want to work

46:17.235 --> 46:20.321
with you one-on-one
and get this exactly right.

46:20.363 --> 46:22.615

they're all kind of right there.

to being exactly

What song did you choose
and why did you choose it?

46:40.592 --> 46:42.719
I chose "I'd Rather Go Blind"
by Etta James.

46:42.761 --> 46:45.597
I literally grew up
listening to this song.

46:45.638 --> 46:49.309
My first record, album ever was
Etta James' greatest hits.

46:49.351 --> 46:50.685

And it was in the back

46:50.727 --> 46:52.520
of the office
of my parents' restaurant,

46:52.562 --> 46:54.564

player, my little keyboard.

a very small restaurant.

that work ethic, is something
that I'm gonna be implementing

Valarie: Yes, ma'am.

47:53.331 --> 47:55.458
Yes, ma'am. Whoo!
Beautiful!

47:55.500 --> 47:59.462
I love the emotion
that you're putting into it.

47:59.504 --> 48:02.340
If there's anything
I want you to focus on,

48:02.382 --> 48:04.384
making sure you knock it
out of the park

48:04.426 --> 48:06.469
is those big notes
at the end.
Yep.

48:06.511 --> 48:09.597
Like, I want you to hit them,
like, with as much confidence

48:09.639 --> 48:12.851
and as much diaphragm
to really sell it at the end.

48:12.892 --> 48:15.645
I am 17 years old
and still in high school,

48:15.687 --> 48:19.315
so it is an honor
to have John Legend critique me.

48:19.357 --> 48:21.192
It's helping me
motivate myself

48:21.234 --> 48:22.652
to do the song
the best that I can

48:22.694 --> 48:24.487
so that I can make it
to the live rounds.

48:24.529 --> 48:27.198
Hello, Valarie.
Ooh! Hi!

48:27.240 --> 48:30.160
So, I chose "Weak"
by SWV.

48:30.201 --> 48:32.203
Ohh!
Taking me back.

48:32.245 --> 48:33.496
And I grew up
in the '90s.

48:33.538 --> 48:35.498
I listened to SWV
all the time.

48:35.540 --> 48:37.542
I wore their
cassette tape out.

48:37.584 --> 48:39.794
We're around the same age,
so I-I-I was

48:39.836 --> 48:41.963
a very big fan
of SWV as well.

48:42.005 --> 48:45.425
Also, the song, you know,
reminds me kind of my husband

48:45.467 --> 48:47.010
'cause my --
when I first met him...

48:47.052 --> 48:48.511
Oh! Alright, now!
[ Laughs ]

48:48.553 --> 48:50.972
...you know, he made me weak
and gave me butterflies.

48:51.014 --> 48:52.432
Okay!
And he still does.

48:52.474 --> 48:58.313
* I don't know what it is
that you've done to me *

48:58.355 --> 49:00.690
My husband was the guy
when we first met

49:00.732 --> 49:05.528
that would open up doors for me,
pull my chair out for me to sit.

49:05.570 --> 49:07.280
So that right there was like,
"Oh, okay!

49:07.322 --> 49:10.408
Well, I could get used to this."
[ Laughs ]

49:10.450 --> 49:12.327
I'm dedicating this song
to you

weak in the knees.

soulful person I know.

When she turns on them jets,

49:41.981 --> 49:43.274
That's it.
Oh, my lord!

49:43.316 --> 49:44.609
I like how you're sounding
in the low notes,

49:44.651 --> 49:46.736
and then building
and building and building.

49:46.778 --> 49:49.447
There's only one melody
I might change.
Okay.

49:49.489 --> 49:52.325
* When the cause and cure
is you *

49:52.367 --> 49:55.036
Maybe go up on
"when the cause and cure."

49:55.078 --> 49:56.579
* Cause and cure is you *

49:56.621 --> 49:58.081
Yeah, something like that.
Okay.

49:58.123 --> 50:02.252
I'm 41 years old, and to be able
to make it to the lives,

50:02.293 --> 50:03.503
it'll mean everything to me.

Thank you so much.

Doing good, buddy.
How about you?
I'm doing alright.

50:17.809 --> 50:20.270
Everybody's singing
a different style of song.

50:20.311 --> 50:21.646
I want to know
what you're singing.

50:21.688 --> 50:24.441
I am singing "Forever After All"
by Luke Combs.

50:24.482 --> 50:26.526
Luke Combs.
We're gonna do some country.

50:26.568 --> 50:29.404
I chose it, man,
because I'm a family guy.

50:29.446 --> 50:31.489
Been gone from my family, and I
just want to let them know that,

50:31.531 --> 50:33.658
"Hey, I'm out here
and I still love you, baby."

50:45.670 --> 50:48.214
For me to show them
and sing to them

50:48.256 --> 50:49.674
exactly how much
they mean to me

and how much I love them
means the world to me.

a country artist.

50:56.598 --> 50:58.475
I feel like there's
so much spiritual

50:58.516 --> 51:01.436
and cultural connection
between country and R&B.

51:01.478 --> 51:03.980
* By their side *
Yeah!

51:04.022 --> 51:06.816
Peyton's voice, I think
it's so soulful and powerful.

Only thing
I would say is the ending,

a little more, like, firm.

51:20.622 --> 51:21.831

Yeah.

a little more comfortable.

this is my closest pairing.

could possibly win,

on purpose.

to prove themselves to me.

You don't just tell
the story vocally,

59:42.290 --> 59:44.751

with your body language.
Yeah.

59:44.793 --> 59:47.671

blown away by you.
Thank you, Blake.

out of that song.

body language onstage

"I don't know what to do.

back and forth."

you probably had the most solid

over the Parijita thing,

with Parijita on this one.

One thing I would say

that sometimes going down
into the lower notes,

right on.

Parijita, everyone's right
about how you carry yourself.

you owned the lyric.

how you're able to do this.

Valarie, some of the beginnings
of the song

1:01:53.505 --> 1:01:56.508
felt like they weren't always
completely on

you got to those bigger notes

it was like, "Wow!"

1:07:29.007 --> 1:07:33.803
Gwen: Kique came with this idea
to do "Hey Ya!" by Outkast.

1:07:33.845 --> 1:07:36.389
When I saw this on paper,
I was like,

1:07:36.431 --> 1:07:37.682
"Gosh, what is he doing?"

1:07:37.724 --> 1:07:39.851
But this felt like it came

1:07:39.893 --> 1:07:41.853
from just so deep inside him

1:07:41.895 --> 1:07:43.563
that it was just --
it felt natural.

1:07:43.605 --> 1:07:47.108
* It's killing me right now *

1:07:47.150 --> 1:07:48.860
Kique: I'm really
taking a risk here,

1:07:48.902 --> 1:07:51.363
but one of my favorite things
to do is change songs.

1:07:51.404 --> 1:07:53.365
* Hey ya *

1:07:53.406 --> 1:07:56.242
I really want Gwen to see
that I'm not just a singer.

1:07:56.284 --> 1:07:58.953
I'm also a musician.
I like to create compositions

1:07:58.995 --> 1:08:02.040
and make music and change things
and make them my own.

1:08:02.082 --> 1:08:03.750
Hey!
* You think you got it *

1:08:03.792 --> 1:08:05.210
* Oh, you think you got it *

1:08:05.251 --> 1:08:07.045
* But got it just don't get it *
I hate him.

1:08:07.087 --> 1:08:08.713
* Till there's nothing at all *
I hate him. Oh, my God.

1:08:08.755 --> 1:08:10.507
I was just like, "Man."
Whoo!

1:08:10.548 --> 1:08:13.176
Kique's amazing at having
such confidence.

1:08:13.218 --> 1:08:15.095
Like, he doesn't care
who's watching.

1:08:15.136 --> 1:08:17.472
He's like,
"I'mma go crazy with it."

1:08:17.514 --> 1:08:20.058
* Hey ya *

1:08:20.100 --> 1:08:23.228
[ Laughs ]
Wow. That was crazy!

1:08:23.269 --> 1:08:24.896
Oh, my God.

1:08:24.938 --> 1:08:27.065
You know what's cool
about you is that, yeah,

1:08:27.107 --> 1:08:30.860
you can do the runs,
but you can also sing in, like,

1:08:30.902 --> 1:08:33.655
a straight-up pop
stylized voice,

1:08:33.697 --> 1:08:35.657
almost like
an alternative voice,

1:08:35.699 --> 1:08:37.325
which is kind of
what Outkast was.

1:08:37.367 --> 1:08:39.744
They were like a blend
of so many different things.

1:08:39.786 --> 1:08:41.705
So, I think if you stuck
to the melody

1:08:41.746 --> 1:08:43.248
on that second verse
a little --

1:08:43.289 --> 1:08:44.290
Here?
Yeah.

1:08:44.332 --> 1:08:45.834
* Happy here *

1:08:45.875 --> 1:08:47.585
If you did the original
right there,

1:08:47.627 --> 1:08:48.753
people would lose
their minds.

1:08:48.795 --> 1:08:50.213
Those low notes.
I know.

1:08:50.255 --> 1:08:51.881
That would be cool.
And then I'd come back in

1:08:51.923 --> 1:08:53.425
with the highest note
in the song.

1:08:53.466 --> 1:08:54.634
Yeah.
* Hey ya *

1:08:54.676 --> 1:08:56.011
Yeah.
That's cool.

1:08:56.052 --> 1:08:57.429
Working with Gwen Stefani
has kind of changed

1:08:57.470 --> 1:09:01.266
my perspective a little bit.
* Happy here *

1:09:01.307 --> 1:09:03.018
* Hey ya *

1:09:03.059 --> 1:09:05.687
Her advice is so good.
She's an awesome coach.

1:09:05.729 --> 1:09:09.441
* Hey ya-a-a-a-a-a-a *

1:09:09.482 --> 1:09:11.192
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you.

He's a rare one.

1:09:12.444 --> 1:09:13.611
Now we have one more!

1:09:13.653 --> 1:09:15.196
-One more.
-I got my girl.

1:09:15.238 --> 1:09:17.449
Rowan: I hate you.
Did she just say,
"I hate you"?

1:09:17.490 --> 1:09:18.783
I hate you.
A little bit.

1:09:18.825 --> 1:09:20.785
This is gonna be crazy hard.
Oh, my God.

1:09:20.827 --> 1:09:22.162

Kique.

1:09:24.164 --> 1:09:25.832
Gwen: Hi, Rowan.
Hi, Gwen.

1:09:25.874 --> 1:09:27.292
You're so talented.

1:09:27.334 --> 1:09:30.378
Thank you.
Everyone's like,
"Oh, she's so good!"

1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:32.213
And it's not just
'cause you're 16.

1:09:32.255 --> 1:09:34.132
You seem older.
Have you been performing?

1:09:34.174 --> 1:09:35.342
Last summer,
I was, like, in a band,

1:09:35.383 --> 1:09:36.885
and I performed around
all summer.

1:09:36.926 --> 1:09:38.595
Oh, wow.
Around my small town,
but, yeah.

1:09:38.636 --> 1:09:40.138
So, why did you choose
this song?

1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:42.724
So, I chose "Vienna"
by Billy Joel,

1:09:42.766 --> 1:09:44.768
one, because I love
older music.

1:09:44.809 --> 1:09:46.811
Which is funny that you say
I, like, seem older.

1:09:46.853 --> 1:09:49.147
I love older music.
I love older music, too.

1:09:49.189 --> 1:09:52.317
And also I just feel like I can
kind of relate to this song.

1:09:52.359 --> 1:09:54.361
It's like a good reminder
to just, like, live in what

1:09:54.402 --> 1:09:57.155
you're living in right now
and not look too far ahead.

1:09:57.197 --> 1:09:59.282
Yeah.
Be where you are
and take it all in.

1:09:59.324 --> 1:10:00.867
I love this song.

1:10:00.909 --> 1:10:03.995
* Slow down, you crazy child *

1:10:04.037 --> 1:10:07.123
* You're so ambitious
for a juvenile *

1:10:07.165 --> 1:10:09.000
* But then if you're so smart *
Ohh!

1:10:09.042 --> 1:10:12.379
* Tell me, why are you
still so afraid? *
She's so, so talented.

1:10:12.420 --> 1:10:14.839
Rowan: I actually listen
to Billy Joel with my dad a lot.

1:10:14.881 --> 1:10:16.383
I love that I'm singing
this song

1:10:16.424 --> 1:10:18.051
because it makes me think
of the times when we're, like,

1:10:18.093 --> 1:10:20.595
sitting in the car
blasting Billy Joel.

1:10:20.637 --> 1:10:22.430

<i>and you were singing</i>

1:10:22.472 --> 1:10:24.766

[ Laughs ]
Right. Yeah, you --

1:10:24.808 --> 1:10:27.185

because...

1:10:27.227 --> 1:10:28.728

He was in a band growing up
and was a musician.

1:10:32.273 --> 1:10:35.318
He's pushing me to be
the best musician that I can be,

1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:38.113
and I just really appreciate him
and all of his support.

<i>You want to say hi?</i>

<i>-She's right here.</i>
<i>-Good luck. Love you.</i>

* Whoa, oh *

1:10:47.247 --> 1:10:50.166
* And you know that
when the truth is told *

Watching Rowan rehearse,
I was like, "No!"

1:10:52.419 --> 1:10:54.254
'Cause I don't want
to go up against Rowan.

1:10:54.295 --> 1:10:56.965
Rowan has one of those,
like, sweet, velvety tones.

1:10:57.007 --> 1:10:58.717
It was genuinely, like,
gorgeous.

1:10:58.758 --> 1:10:59.926

a little bit of a crispy,

which is really beautiful.

1:11:16.234 --> 1:11:18.069
And it's so controlled.
Yeah.

1:11:18.111 --> 1:11:19.946

even more, I think.

That's just like spice.

1:11:21.364 --> 1:11:24.075
Yeah.
You sing with
super emotion,

1:11:24.117 --> 1:11:26.202

maybe play with the lyrics

a different side to you.

You're letting them
in your soul,

the storytelling in my song

but also with my body language

a little bit,"
