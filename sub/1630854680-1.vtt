Hi Wendy.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.533
Oh Paul, that's perfect.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.867
Hey, guys.
Can't wait for a cup.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.367
Aw... that goes just
in the back, Deb.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.767
That is gonna come
in handy.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.200
The kids are gonna love that.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.200
And this is for you.

01:06.100 --> 01:06.767
Oh, Sergeant Wilson!

01:06.900 --> 01:07.867
Hi!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.367
The toys for eight to ten
year-olds go over there.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.367
Got it. Thanks Danielle.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.333
Are Matthew and the boys

01:11.467 --> 01:13.367
so excited about
the Christmas holidays?

01:13.500 --> 01:14.266
Ecstatic.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.166
What about Audrey?

01:15.300 --> 01:16.100
Oh, over the moon.

01:16.233 --> 01:17.500
- Oorah!
- Oorah!

01:19.467 --> 01:21.300
Sorry, I'm late.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.300
The math teachers had a
last-minute gift exchange.

01:23.433 --> 01:25.266
Ah, it feels so good to be
off for Christmas vacation.

01:25.400 --> 01:25.967
Doesn't it?

01:26.100 --> 01:26.834
Vacation?

01:26.967 --> 01:29.133
We have so many toys left
to collect

01:29.266 --> 01:31.033
and don't get me started
on the toy drive party.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.700
I don't even have a Christmas
tree yet.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.533
I don't know how I'm gonna
get it all done by Christmas.

01:34.667 --> 01:36.166
Yeah, but that stuff is fun.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.867
I mean, teaching a bunch
of 17-year-olds calculus?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.633
Now, that deserves combat pay.

01:41.433 --> 01:42.367
Oh, they're here.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.333
Let's make some Christmas magic!

01:44.467 --> 01:46.533
Santa and his elf
are in the house.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.367
Ah! Well Pierce,

01:48.500 --> 01:49.934
I think you are missing
the beard and the belly

01:50.066 --> 01:51.033
but we'll take it.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.033
Merry Christmas, ladies.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.533
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

01:55.333 --> 01:57.166
Thank you so much
for doing this.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.166
You guys always come through
for the kids.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.934
Best part about working
for a toy company.

02:01.066 --> 02:02.200
Christmas, baby!

02:03.133 --> 02:04.400
Let me show you
what we got.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.400
Oh!

02:08.533 --> 02:10.500
We have got the hottest
new toys,

02:10.633 --> 02:12.100
the kids are gonna
love them.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.333
Oh!

02:13.467 --> 02:18.700
This one is special for frazzled
toy drive coordinators.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.000
Stress Santa?

02:20.133 --> 02:21.266
It's perfect.

02:22.066 --> 02:22.767
Oh!

02:22.900 --> 02:23.600
I love these things.

02:25.000 --> 02:25.867
Oh, make that stop!

02:27.000 --> 02:28.500
Can we start bringing these
in for you guys?

02:28.633 --> 02:29.533
Yeah.

02:29.667 --> 02:30.533
Aww, that'd be great, Sergeant.
Thank you.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.233
- I will help direct.
- There we go.

02:32.367 --> 02:33.367
Perfect.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.033
Thank you.

02:35.166 --> 02:35.567
Nice shot.

02:35.700 --> 02:36.433
Nailed it!

02:37.367 --> 02:38.233
- Thanks bud.
- See you in there.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.367
Thanks Rick.

02:39.967 --> 02:40.934
So where's my
other favorite girl?

02:41.066 --> 02:43.533
Oh, Audrey is caroling
at the retirement home.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.033
Right.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.400
And are we still on
for tonight?

02:46.533 --> 02:47.400
Ooh... yeah.

02:47.533 --> 02:48.200
The tangled Christmas lights
in my garage

02:48.333 --> 02:50.166
have your name
all over them...

02:50.300 --> 02:51.900
should you choose to accept
the mission.

02:52.033 --> 02:54.166
You are looking at
the master detangler.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.400
Okay.

02:55.734 --> 02:56.533
What about the tree?

02:56.667 --> 02:57.667
Tomorrow.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.200
Audrey wants you to help
us pick one out at the lot.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.500
Oh! And afterwards
we're gonna set up

03:00.633 --> 03:02.166
a collection booth
in Town Square.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.967
I wanna get as many toys
as possible.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.500
It is crunch time.

03:05.633 --> 03:08.834
Yes and yes and anything else
you need me to say yes to?

03:08.967 --> 03:10.300
You're the best.

03:10.433 --> 03:11.700
Oh... and Danielle?

03:11.834 --> 03:16.967
Um... I was hoping maybe
we could talk about
some things later.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.900
Of course.

03:19.033 --> 03:19.834
Okay.

03:19.967 --> 03:20.967
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.100
Ok.

03:28.066 --> 03:29.433
How was the concert?

03:29.567 --> 03:31.133
It was okay.

03:31.266 --> 03:32.367
Oh honey,

03:32.500 --> 03:35.233
it's the start of Christmas
break and you look like...

03:35.367 --> 03:36.834
you kinda look like
the scrooge!

03:38.266 --> 03:39.433
What's wrong?

03:39.567 --> 03:40.934
Everything.

03:41.066 --> 03:43.200
Oh, this calls for
extra sprinkles.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.333
Here you go, sweetheart.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.800
A girl at school said I'm weird
'cause I'm bringing my mom

03:56.934 --> 03:58.967
to the Christmas
father-daughter dance.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.333
Oh honey.

04:00.467 --> 04:01.667
You're not weird.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.934
And you know some of the dads

04:03.066 --> 04:05.367
are deployed anyway so you
won't be the only one there...

04:05.500 --> 04:08.200
But I'm bringing my mom.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.266
Yeah.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.567
And your mom has got
some pretty cool moves.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.367
Mommy!

04:16.100 --> 04:18.834
Do you think Daddy would've
been excited about the dance?

04:18.967 --> 04:19.734
Oh yeah.

04:19.867 --> 04:21.667
Your dad loved to dance.

04:21.800 --> 04:22.967
At our wedding,

04:23.100 --> 04:25.133
he was trying to do a split
and he ripped his dress blues.

04:25.266 --> 04:25.834
No way.

04:25.967 --> 04:27.233
Yeah way.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.633
I think he mostly
would've been excited

04:28.767 --> 04:31.867
about the special night
for just the two of you.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.867
There's lots I don't remember
about him.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.900
I know, honey.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.500
- Hello?
- Hello?

04:39.633 --> 04:40.867
In the kitchen!

04:41.367 --> 04:42.533
Did someone call
the Christmas cavalry?

04:42.667 --> 04:43.533
Yes!

04:44.000 --> 04:44.900
Hi Aunt Jane.

04:45.033 --> 04:45.467
Hi!

04:46.467 --> 04:47.367
Hi Pierce.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.166
Hello.

04:49.433 --> 04:50.533
Now I bet you dazzled
'em today

04:50.667 --> 04:52.900
with your amazing voice,
didn't you?

04:53.266 --> 04:54.533
That's my girl.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.233
Okay. You wanna lead me
to these lights?

04:57.367 --> 04:58.400
Yes.

04:58.533 --> 04:59.533
Uh... can you two get started
on the decorations?

04:59.667 --> 05:00.900
Mm-hmm.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.867
By the time we're done Mrs.
Claus herself will be jealous.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.767
Okay... here we are.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.467
Ooh boy.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.567
They are more tangled
than I remember.

05:12.700 --> 05:13.667
Sorry.

05:14.333 --> 05:15.300
Goodness.

05:15.433 --> 05:16.266
Yeah, don't worry
about that.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.900
I just hope I can do
the house justice.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.533
Hey, you string up five lights
and I'd be happy.

05:20.667 --> 05:23.300
Last year I stapled my shirt
to the house.

05:23.433 --> 05:24.900
Now that's something
I'd like to see.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.567
Hey, it was my favorite shirt!

05:26.700 --> 05:27.900
I'm sorry about your shirt.

05:28.033 --> 05:29.734
Yeah.

05:29.867 --> 05:30.900
Seriously, I'm more excited

05:31.033 --> 05:34.266
about this Christmas than
I have been in a long time.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.967
I'm really happy you're
spending it with us.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.100
Me too.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.133
You said you wanted to talk
to me about something?

05:42.266 --> 05:45.400
Yeah, um... okay if we wait
'til later?

05:45.533 --> 05:48.100
Might be a while,
but, yeah, sure.

05:48.467 --> 05:50.533
- Thank you for doing this.
- My pleasure.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.266
You're awesome.
Good luck!

05:54.834 --> 05:58.467
It is beginning to look a lot
like Christmas in here.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.400
All we need is a tree.
Right, kiddo?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.266
Hey, Aud...

06:09.400 --> 06:11.500
I have some more decorations
in the kitchen.

06:11.633 --> 06:14.100
And there might be some
chocolate in there too.

06:14.233 --> 06:15.333
Okay.

06:22.066 --> 06:24.000
What's with Audrey?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.934
The Christmas father-daughter
dance is coming up

06:26.066 --> 06:28.767
and she's upset about Colby.

06:28.900 --> 06:31.333
She's started asking a lot
of questions about him lately.

06:31.467 --> 06:32.834
Kinda caught me off guard.

06:32.967 --> 06:35.533
She is getting older.
She must be curious.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.500
She wasn't even five
when he died.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.300
I can't believe that was
almost three years ago.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.100
You know, I was gonna ask...
the hospital owes me,

06:43.233 --> 06:46.333
like, a month's worth of
vacation days I'm not gonna use.

06:46.467 --> 06:48.266
Why don't we go somewhere
for Spring Break?

06:48.400 --> 06:49.200
We could bring
Mom and Dad.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.367
Yeah.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.967
Oh! I see you found
the chocolate reindeer.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.800
Are you gonna share
or what?

06:59.266 --> 07:00.533
Thank you.

07:04.233 --> 07:05.233
Remember this?

07:05.367 --> 07:08.200
I do remember that Christmas.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.533
What are you looking for?

07:12.667 --> 07:13.567
The bell Colby gave me

07:13.700 --> 07:15.333
that he turned into
a Christmas ornament.

07:15.467 --> 07:18.834
- Right.
- It's still missing
after three years.

07:18.967 --> 07:21.100
How does an ornament
randomly vanish?

07:21.233 --> 07:23.900
Well you do have a lot
of Christmas stuff.

07:24.033 --> 07:25.567
I'm sure it's in
the house somewhere.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.567
Every year I think it's gonna
randomly gonna turn up

07:27.700 --> 07:30.934
in one of these bins,
but it doesn't.

07:31.467 --> 07:35.266
Okay, hi!
Miss chocolate mustache.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.700
- Guess what time it is?
- Bed time.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.233
Yes, it is.

07:40.367 --> 07:43.200
Please go upstairs
and wash your face.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.567
We'll see you up there.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.100
Oh! Pierce is probably
freezing out there.

07:47.233 --> 07:47.867
I'll start cleaning up.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.934
Let him know
I'll be out soon.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.867
Here you go.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.266
I don't want a book tonight, Mommy.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.433
Really?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.533
Tell me a story about Daddy.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.166
This is a Christmas classic.
You're gonna love it.

08:09.266 --> 08:10.066
Please!

08:10.200 --> 08:12.433
Tell me how you met Daddy.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.533
Okay.

08:17.300 --> 08:20.066
Um... hmm.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.000
Well... it was 11 years ago

08:24.133 --> 08:26.667
at the Christmas tree lighting
here on base.

08:26.800 --> 08:31.667
And I had taught here
for a couple years already.

08:31.800 --> 08:32.700
You would never know

08:32.834 --> 08:35.100
you're surrounded by
a 55,0000-acre fortress.

08:35.233 --> 08:37.467
Five thousand Marines
and two single ladies?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.467
What's a girl gotta do
around here?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.667
Oh, hi Dad.

08:40.800 --> 08:41.967
Sophia.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.166
Merry Christmas, Danielle.
Good to see you.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.133
Merry Christmas
General Anderson.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
Merry Christmas everyone.

08:48.934 --> 08:52.233
I'm Major Colby Aames with
the Marine Corp toy drive

08:52.367 --> 08:55.166
and it is my honor to flip
the switch tonight.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.133
This year we have
a Noble fir tree,

09:00.266 --> 09:02.467
which is considered the king
of Christmas trees,

09:02.600 --> 09:05.500
because of its stiff branches
that can hold a ton of lights.

09:05.633 --> 09:08.200
Does anyone wanna guess
how many lights are up there?

09:08.333 --> 09:09.834
A thousand?

09:09.967 --> 09:11.467
Close, 2,000.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.166
Are we ready?

09:12.300 --> 09:13.300
Five...

09:13.433 --> 09:18.467
Four... Three...
Two... One.

09:25.033 --> 09:27.367
A little technical difficulty.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.567
- I'm gonna go help him.
- Hmm.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.400
Hi.

09:32.533 --> 09:34.567
Do you wanna check the circuit
breaker and I'll go stall?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.200
It's kinda like one of
my super powers.

09:36.333 --> 09:37.834
Thanks.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.867
Hi everyone!

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Uh... Merry Christmas!

09:44.133 --> 09:51.567
Um... so... what do Santa's
little helpers learn at school?

09:52.867 --> 09:54.333
Anybody?

09:57.834 --> 09:59.834
The elf-abet.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.700
That's funny, Mommy.

10:05.834 --> 10:06.834
Well, thank you.

10:06.967 --> 10:10.300
I thought so too but no one
was really laughing.

10:10.433 --> 10:13.300
There was one person
who got my jokes though.

10:13.433 --> 10:17.667
What do you call a snowman
with a six-pack?

10:17.800 --> 10:21.533
The abdominal snowman.
That's a good one.

10:23.033 --> 10:23.967
Sorry about that folks,

10:24.100 --> 10:26.900
I guess Army engineers
installed the wiring.

10:28.767 --> 10:31.734
I'm just kidding.
Let's, let's try this again.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.567
Whoo, that was a close one.

10:42.700 --> 10:43.633
You're telling me.

10:43.767 --> 10:46.500
Hey, uh... thanks for that.

10:46.633 --> 10:48.066
I'm Colby, by the way.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.200
Danielle.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.367
Oh, this is my good friend, Pierce.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.066
The new company he works
for donated a bunch of toys.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.033
- That's so nice.
- It's nice to meet you.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.367
Nice to meet you.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.300
Um, I've gotta run.

10:58.433 --> 10:59.200
I'll see you at
the Christmas party?

10:59.333 --> 11:01.333
- See you.
- Okay.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.433
So... can I repay you

11:03.567 --> 11:07.467
with some world famous
Marine Corp hot cocoa?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.800
Well, if it's world famous...

11:12.066 --> 11:14.300
I met Daddy and Pierce
that night.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.100
They actually became
really good friends

11:16.233 --> 11:17.266
because of the toy drive.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.000
- Cool!
- Mm-hmm.

11:20.600 --> 11:26.066
We took this photo together
about an hour after we met.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.367
The first time I saw your daddy
I had butterflies in my stomach.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.734
You ate butterflies?

11:31.867 --> 11:35.133
No, that's when
you're excited about someone

11:35.266 --> 11:36.467
or something.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.266
Like opening presents
on Christmas morning?

11:39.400 --> 11:41.233
Exactly!

11:41.367 --> 11:44.200
'Cause you know the best things
happen at Christmastime.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.300
My birthday?

11:45.433 --> 11:46.934
Your birthday.

11:47.066 --> 11:48.266
Uh, Mommy and Daddy's wedding.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.266
Star coming into our lives.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.133
It's a magical time of year.

11:54.266 --> 11:56.967
Do you have any more good
stories about Daddy?

11:57.100 --> 11:58.533
I do.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.667
I actually used to keep
a journal.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.867
Do you still have it?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.133
Yeah.

12:04.266 --> 12:07.033
I haven't written in it
in a long time.

12:07.166 --> 12:07.900
You know what little lady,

12:08.033 --> 12:11.000
it is time for you
to go to bed.

12:11.133 --> 12:12.166
Okay.

12:27.967 --> 12:29.767
Okay.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.100
Oh, hi!

12:32.233 --> 12:35.500
Oh, I hope you're not
too cold out here.

12:35.633 --> 12:37.934
Uh, I am a human icicle.

12:39.900 --> 12:44.100
But if I did this right,
it's all gonna be worth it.

12:44.233 --> 12:46.700
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.600
- Okay.
- Alright.

12:48.734 --> 12:50.500
Just going to set this down...
let's see...

12:51.567 --> 12:53.467
Please work. Okay.

12:56.133 --> 13:00.100
Oh, it's beautiful!
Oh, thank you so much.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.433
You're beautiful.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.367
Aw...

13:07.633 --> 13:09.266
Um...

13:09.400 --> 13:10.834
Danielle?

13:10.967 --> 13:14.033
There was something
I'd like to ask you.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.266
Okay...

13:15.400 --> 13:18.066
Um... I know that we've
only been dating nine months.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.834
Can you believe that it's been
11 years since we first met?

13:20.967 --> 13:23.033
I was literally just telling
Audrey about that night.

13:23.166 --> 13:23.767
Really?

13:23.900 --> 13:24.767
Yeah.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.100
Well, I've come to know you

13:27.233 --> 13:29.767
as the most incredible woman
and mom.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.734
On our best and worst days
we always manage

13:33.867 --> 13:38.033
to make each other smile...
and I want that forever.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.867
So... um...

13:42.567 --> 13:44.934
Oh, my gosh.
Uh... uh...

13:45.066 --> 13:47.233
I love you, Danielle.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.033
Will you marry me?

13:49.166 --> 13:52.100
I... I did not expect this.

13:52.233 --> 13:54.367
Can I talk to Audrey
about it first?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.100
Yes. Yes, of course.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.800
Audrey, honey, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

14:23.934 --> 14:25.633
The tree? Can I pick it
out myself?

14:25.767 --> 14:26.734
Yes, you can.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.500
But it's something else.

14:28.633 --> 14:31.066
You know how you really care
about Pierce

14:31.200 --> 14:32.500
and he cares about you?

14:32.633 --> 14:33.533
Yeah.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.166
Well, last night he asked me
to marry him.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.100
He did?

14:38.233 --> 14:39.333
How do you feel about that?

14:39.467 --> 14:42.767
Um... I guess it's okay.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.667
- He's super nice.
- He is super nice.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.433
And I know he's never gonna
replace Daddy

14:48.567 --> 14:51.667
but he is gonna make
the best step-dad.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.166
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.734
Come on in.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.934
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.033
Hi Audrey.

15:07.166 --> 15:08.734
This is for you.

15:08.867 --> 15:09.967
Aww...

15:10.100 --> 15:11.300
I already have a bear.

15:11.433 --> 15:16.166
It used to play my daddy singing
"Silent Night", but it broke.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.333
Colby got it for her so that
she could hear his voice

15:18.467 --> 15:20.000
when he was deployed.

15:20.133 --> 15:21.166
Sorry.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.133
Well, maybe your daddy's bear
could use a friend.

15:24.266 --> 15:27.500
Well, my bear does get lonely
when I'm at school.

15:27.767 --> 15:28.834
Um... Audrey?

15:29.433 --> 15:33.734
Um... Listen, I just
want you to know

15:33.867 --> 15:35.867
how special you and your mom
are to me

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
and that I will always be here
for the both of you, okay?

15:40.867 --> 15:42.900
Why don't you go upstairs
and introduce your bears?

15:43.033 --> 15:44.066
Okay.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.900
She is taking all of this better
than I thought.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.834
So, does that mean...?

15:53.967 --> 15:54.900
Right.

15:55.033 --> 15:56.467
- Yes!
- Yeah?

15:56.600 --> 15:58.667
- The answer is yes.
- Yeah?

16:02.567 --> 16:04.900
Well then I'm glad
I brought this.

16:06.767 --> 16:07.867
Care to make it official?

16:08.000 --> 16:12.734
Yeah.
It's just so beautiful.

16:24.333 --> 16:27.734
Wow, there's so many trees.
Which one will we pick?

16:27.867 --> 16:28.767
I don't know.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.367
Can I help you?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.734
Yes. We want something big,
like the biggest tree you got.

16:32.867 --> 16:33.600
Right Audrey?

16:33.734 --> 16:34.567
Yes!

16:34.700 --> 16:35.266
It's your lucky day.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.200
We got in a small shipment

16:37.333 --> 16:39.100
of what we like to call
in the business

16:39.233 --> 16:40.734
'the king of Christmas trees.'

16:40.867 --> 16:42.100
Follow me.

16:44.233 --> 16:48.233
Mommy, isn't that what Daddy
called the tree in your story?

16:48.367 --> 16:50.133
Yes.

16:50.266 --> 16:51.633
Yeah it is, honey.

16:51.767 --> 16:53.200
Hey girls, over here!

16:53.333 --> 16:55.300
Come on, let's go.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.367
What do you think
of this one?

16:57.500 --> 16:58.400
I love it!

16:58.533 --> 16:59.533
How about you, Danielle?

16:59.667 --> 17:00.633

17:00.767 --> 17:02.000

Thank you for donating to
the Marine Corps toy drive.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.500
I still can't believe you two
are engaged.

17:39.633 --> 17:40.533
Let me see the ring again.

17:40.667 --> 17:41.600
Oh...

17:41.734 --> 17:42.300
Come on!

17:42.433 --> 17:43.633
Okay.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.500
Oh! Nice work.

17:47.266 --> 17:48.500
I'm so happy for you two.

17:48.633 --> 17:49.700
Thank you, Sophia.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.467
I'm a very lucky man.

17:51.734 --> 17:53.633
Oh, thank you!

17:53.767 --> 17:55.533
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

17:55.667 --> 17:56.567
Mommy?

17:56.700 --> 17:58.500
Can I get a Christmas cookie
from the bakery?

17:58.633 --> 17:59.433
Sure, honey.

17:59.567 --> 18:00.600
Ooh, I'll take her.

18:00.734 --> 18:02.400
I'm dying for one of those
gingerbread lattes.

18:02.533 --> 18:03.533
Do you guys want one?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.000
Uh, I'm good,
thank you.

18:05.133 --> 18:06.266
I'm okay,
thank you.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
Okay. Let's go!

18:08.467 --> 18:09.433
Oh! Thank you.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.600
Danielle?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.200
Are you okay?

18:23.333 --> 18:27.233
Um, no... I... no... just
a lotta happy holiday faces.

18:27.367 --> 18:30.367
We should get home
and decorate the tree.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.467
Okay. Sure.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.000
The star!

18:46.133 --> 18:48.000
Will you do the honors for us,
Audrey?

18:48.133 --> 18:49.033
'Kay.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.000
I'm gonna lift you up. Ready?
One, two, three!

18:57.133 --> 18:58.767
There we go.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.333
Ah, the perfect tree.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.300
It's not.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.767
Why honey?

19:07.900 --> 19:10.200
We're still missing
Daddy's ornament.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.400
Did you find it, Mommy?

19:11.533 --> 19:13.433
No, no I haven't.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.934
What does it look like?
Maybe I can help.

19:16.066 --> 19:18.867
It's a... a little gold bell
with a red ribbon.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.834
Colby gave it to me.

19:20.967 --> 19:21.734
We've been looking everywhere

19:21.867 --> 19:25.000
but I don't think
we're gonna find it.

19:25.133 --> 19:26.333
You know what?

19:26.467 --> 19:29.834
It is time for you to put on
your pj's and brush your teeth.

19:29.967 --> 19:31.533
See you upstairs.

19:33.734 --> 19:37.400
Um... Pierce, if Mommy
says it's okay,

19:37.533 --> 19:40.934
can you take me to
the Christmas dance?

19:42.567 --> 19:45.900
Oh... I... I am more
than okay with it.

19:46.033 --> 19:46.900
You know what?

19:47.033 --> 19:49.867
Pierce is a better dancer
than I am anyway.

19:53.033 --> 19:55.900
I would absolutely love that.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.867
Thank you, Audrey.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.200
You're welcome.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.300
Oh!

20:03.000 --> 20:03.867
Okay.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.033
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.433
She just made my Christmas.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.033
Aww.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.600
I think you made hers too.

20:19.734 --> 20:21.567
Seriously though, it is
gonna be three hours

20:21.700 --> 20:23.567
of boy bands
and tween girls.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.200
Bring it on.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.367
They ain't seen nothing
like me.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.500
Tell me a story.

20:32.633 --> 20:34.266
Well, I got a new book!

20:34.400 --> 20:36.333
An elf and a fairy
save Christmas

20:36.467 --> 20:38.066
with their magical powers.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.533
How can you resist?

20:41.333 --> 20:44.867
Daddy... tell me about
his ornament.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.066
Why'd he make it?

20:50.667 --> 20:52.066
Alright.

20:55.300 --> 20:59.934
It was Christmas morning.
About a year after we met.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.266
Aww.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.834
I love it!

21:12.567 --> 21:14.533
Okay. Here is your last one.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.433
Our unofficial first date.

21:21.567 --> 21:23.667
Look at us.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.567
It's the best day of my life,
meeting you.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.367
Mine too.

21:29.734 --> 21:30.967
I have one more thing.

21:31.100 --> 21:35.000
It's... it's not really
a present, it's more
of a commitment.

21:36.567 --> 21:38.433
Oh, my goodness!

21:42.100 --> 21:45.300
Oh, he's the cutest thing
I've ever seen!

21:45.433 --> 21:46.233
Oh!

21:46.367 --> 21:47.467
He's a... he's a rescue.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.467
I thought he could keep you
company whenever I'm away.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.567
Aww, I love him
so much already!

21:52.700 --> 21:53.900
There's one more thing.

21:54.033 --> 21:56.000
It's... it's on his collar.

21:59.533 --> 22:00.400
Wait, are you serious?

22:00.533 --> 22:01.967
Danielle...

22:02.100 --> 22:05.300
I have never loved anyone
the way I love you.

22:05.433 --> 22:06.900
I was always that Marine

22:07.033 --> 22:10.300
who wasn't afraid to die
and... I met you.

22:10.433 --> 22:13.133
And you give me a reason
to wanna make it home.

22:13.266 --> 22:15.300
But I know it's a lot to ask
to be with me.

22:15.433 --> 22:17.000
This military life
can be hard

22:17.133 --> 22:19.633
and if it's too much
I totally understand.

22:19.767 --> 22:24.567
No, no... there are
no guarantees in life.

22:24.700 --> 22:28.200
Sometimes the best things
come from the biggest risks.

22:28.333 --> 22:31.734
My mom always said
to follow my heart.

22:31.867 --> 22:35.433
My entire heart
is with you.

22:36.967 --> 22:38.633
We met just
before Christmas

22:38.767 --> 22:40.734
so this felt like the perfect
day to ask.

22:40.867 --> 22:43.333
Because I want to spend
every Christmas with you

22:43.467 --> 22:45.300
for the rest of my life.

22:45.433 --> 22:48.900
Danielle Randall...
will you marry me?

22:50.700 --> 22:52.400
Yes!

23:02.166 --> 23:05.967
Oh... I can't wait to tell
everybody we're engaged.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.700
And we have a puppy.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.867
Oh, yes we got a puppy.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.667
He needs a name.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.133
Oh, my goodness,
you need a name.

23:13.266 --> 23:16.266
Yeah! Oh!

23:18.200 --> 23:20.266
What about Star?

23:20.400 --> 23:22.300
- Star.
- Yeah.

23:22.433 --> 23:22.967
It's perfect.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.433
Star. Hmm?

23:25.567 --> 23:27.100
Do you like that?

23:27.233 --> 23:29.467
Our first Christmas
ornament together.

23:31.266 --> 23:33.767
Oh!

23:38.233 --> 23:40.133
We're engaged!

23:40.800 --> 23:43.300
Is Daddy watching over us?

23:43.433 --> 23:46.734
Always, honey. Always.

23:48.033 --> 23:51.633
Um... so he knows I didn't
brush my teeth?

23:51.767 --> 23:58.800
Ooh... you better get in that
bathroom and brush those teeth!

24:14.400 --> 24:15.367
What's that?

24:15.500 --> 24:17.000
Either Santa's reindeer
are hiding in the closet

24:17.133 --> 24:19.300
or Star got in the Christmas
ornaments again.

24:20.300 --> 24:21.433
Star!

24:21.567 --> 24:22.500
Star, come here boy!

24:22.633 --> 24:23.333
Star!

24:23.467 --> 24:24.967
Come here, boy.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.200
Come here!

24:26.767 --> 24:29.934
Mommy! The ornament!

24:30.066 --> 24:32.467
Yeah, it is.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.633
It must've been
under the couch.

24:34.767 --> 24:35.700
Which is weird

24:35.834 --> 24:38.367
'cause I've looked under there
a million times.

24:57.266 --> 24:58.734
What am I doing?

25:01.000 --> 25:05.867
And this batch is going to,
um... Grace Community Church.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.900
Thank you so much.

25:08.467 --> 25:11.066
I come bearing inspiration.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.200
I think you are gonna
look great

25:12.333 --> 25:13.467
in a strapless dress
this time.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.734
Thank you.

25:14.867 --> 25:17.300
Maybe you'd prefer I run out
and get some golf magazines?

25:17.433 --> 25:18.500
Sure, yeah!

25:18.900 --> 25:19.967
Danielle?

25:20.867 --> 25:22.533
What is going on?

25:22.667 --> 25:24.633
Can I ask you something?

25:24.767 --> 25:26.100
Do you believe in signs?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.533
Things written in the stars
kinda signs?

25:28.667 --> 25:31.467
Like someone or something is
trying to send you a message.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.066
Uh... okay, I think
we're talking in code now.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.700
Um... do you wanna tell me

25:35.834 --> 25:37.633
what's going on there,
Nancy Drew?

25:43.233 --> 25:46.533
I started telling Audrey these
stories about Colby before bed.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.066
The first one I told her
was about the night

25:48.200 --> 25:49.867
we met at the Christmas
tree lighting.

25:50.000 --> 25:50.967
Oh, it was such
a fun night.

25:51.100 --> 25:54.400
Your jokes were so bad.

25:54.533 --> 25:56.066
I'm sorry, I'm listening.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.200
Well, yesterday at
the Christmas tree lot,

25:58.333 --> 26:00.767
the guy said,
"king of trees".

26:00.900 --> 26:02.767
I mean, you remember
Colby said that.

26:02.900 --> 26:03.834
And?

26:03.967 --> 26:07.000
And... later I saw a guy
who looked just like him

26:07.133 --> 26:08.800
in his Force Recon jacket.

26:08.934 --> 26:10.533
This is a military town, Danielle.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.200
Okay. So how about this one?

26:12.333 --> 26:13.367
Last night I told her
the story

26:13.500 --> 26:15.600
about how Colby proposed to me
with that ornament.

26:15.734 --> 26:17.367
Well it's been missing
for three years.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.500
Star found it this morning.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.967
Why are all of these strange
things happening?

26:25.100 --> 26:27.000
They're called coincidences?

26:27.133 --> 26:31.100
This is gonna sound crazy
but I feel Colby's presence.

26:31.233 --> 26:33.467
It's... it's like he's
all around me.

26:33.600 --> 26:38.000
Okay, look... I don't mean
to psychoanalyze but...

26:38.133 --> 26:39.834
you did just get engaged.

26:39.967 --> 26:43.333
Maybe you're feeling a little
guilt on some level?

26:43.467 --> 26:44.667
Like you're betraying Colby,

26:44.800 --> 26:47.533
even though you are not,
of course.

26:47.667 --> 26:48.433
Maybe.

26:48.567 --> 26:49.633
And it's Christmas.

26:49.767 --> 26:50.867
A lot of big things
in your life

26:51.000 --> 26:52.533
have happened around
the holidays.

26:52.667 --> 26:54.934
True.

26:55.066 --> 26:57.367
Colby... he was your first love.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.367
He's always gonna be
a part of you.

27:00.500 --> 27:04.100
But you are allowed to be
happy again.

27:04.233 --> 27:06.500
I know you're right.

27:06.633 --> 27:08.834
Of course I am right.

27:08.967 --> 27:10.033
Okay.

27:10.166 --> 27:14.834
You are gonna focus on Pierce
and the future, okay?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.934
Not some weird signs and
things you can't control.

27:17.066 --> 27:18.166
It's Christmas!

27:18.300 --> 27:20.033
Enjoy this time.

27:24.567 --> 27:26.533
Well, that's a really
good snowman.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.333
Can we hang these
on the tree?

27:28.467 --> 27:30.200
The more ornaments
the better.

27:30.333 --> 27:31.433
Since we have a Noble fir,

27:31.567 --> 27:35.967
we can hang as many as we want.
Just like Daddy said.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.433
Hey, Audrey!

27:39.567 --> 27:41.266
Have you decided what you're
gonna wear to the dance yet?

27:41.400 --> 27:43.500
Mommy bought me a new dress.

27:43.633 --> 27:44.734
Well, I'm gonna wear

27:44.867 --> 27:47.066
a red and green tie with little
dancing Santas on it.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.600
Cool!

27:48.734 --> 27:51.066
Come on Auntie Jane,
let's go hang these up.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.033
Yeah, let's go put these
on the tree.

28:00.133 --> 28:02.100
Is everything okay?

28:07.767 --> 28:10.000
This is kind of hard
to talk to you about.

28:10.133 --> 28:12.100
But I, I always want us
to be open.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.834
Of course.

28:13.967 --> 28:15.133
Um...

28:16.333 --> 28:19.433
a lot of memories of Colby
have been popping up lately.

28:19.567 --> 28:20.800
And, I guess,
maybe it's because

28:20.934 --> 28:25.100
of our engagement
and Audrey's curiosity.

28:25.233 --> 28:28.166
I'm sorry, this is probably the
last thing you wanna hear about.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.166
Hey, no, no, no.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.567
I miss Colby too.

28:32.700 --> 28:36.400
I can only imagine what you
must be feeling right now.

28:36.533 --> 28:40.133
You know that you can talk
to me about him any time.

28:40.266 --> 28:42.000
That is so sweet.

28:42.133 --> 28:43.600
And I will.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.967
But right now I wanna
focus on us.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.633
We're engaged!

28:47.767 --> 28:50.433
Right. You're my fiancée.

28:50.567 --> 28:52.133
I think that's the first time
I've said that out loud.

28:53.567 --> 28:54.567
Have you thought about
a date yet?

28:54.700 --> 28:56.567
Oh gosh, um... no.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.300
I mean, we should also talk
about where we're gonna live

28:58.433 --> 28:59.533
because my condo's too small

28:59.667 --> 29:02.533
and we need to find a good
school district for Audrey.

29:02.667 --> 29:04.166
I hope it's okay,

29:04.300 --> 29:05.500
I actually talked to a realtor
friend of mine the other day.

29:05.633 --> 29:06.400
Already?

29:06.533 --> 29:07.667
Too soon?

29:07.800 --> 29:10.734
No, no. I... I just hadn't
thought about moving off base.

29:10.867 --> 29:11.633
But it makes sense,

29:11.767 --> 29:13.033
we should move once
we're married.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.233
Look, it's okay.

29:14.367 --> 29:17.233
We do not have to make
any of these decisions today.

29:17.367 --> 29:18.300
Yeah.

29:18.433 --> 29:19.533
Maybe we just make it through
the holidays.

29:19.667 --> 29:20.867
You're right.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.033
I mean, you know me.

29:22.166 --> 29:23.633
If you'll let me, I'll have
our retirement mapped out

29:23.767 --> 29:25.333
before New Year's.

29:25.467 --> 29:26.834
You're okay with Florida, right?

29:26.967 --> 29:28.133
Uh... I... I...

29:28.266 --> 29:29.533
I'm just kidding,
that was a joke.

29:29.667 --> 29:30.800
I'm sorry.

29:30.934 --> 29:32.600
Oh!

29:33.533 --> 29:35.533
Good!

29:36.767 --> 29:38.500
Who's this, Mommy?

29:38.633 --> 29:40.967
Oh... our wedding photo!

29:41.100 --> 29:44.066
That is Jenny. She was the
flower girl at our wedding.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.400
She's the daughter of one of
Daddy's friends from his unit.

29:46.533 --> 29:47.800
She's pretty.

29:47.934 --> 29:50.300
Mm-hmm.

29:50.433 --> 29:51.700
Well, she'd be a teenager
by now.

29:51.834 --> 29:54.166
I haven't seen her or her mom
Lisa in years.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.800
I wish I was at your wedding.

29:55.934 --> 29:57.900
What was it like?

29:58.033 --> 30:01.567
Do you have any more
good stories?

30:01.700 --> 30:05.700
It was a very cold
Christmas Eve.

30:06.133 --> 30:08.667
Okay, ready honey.
Come on.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.333
She's a little bit nervous.

30:13.467 --> 30:14.433
Oh!

30:15.367 --> 30:16.400
You know what?

30:16.533 --> 30:18.834
I'm feeling a little
nervous too.

30:18.967 --> 30:20.900
Do you think you could
help me?

30:21.033 --> 30:22.633
Yeah! We could be
brave together.

30:22.767 --> 30:23.500
Yeah?

30:23.633 --> 30:24.867
Thank you.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.867
I say let's do this.

30:51.533 --> 30:53.033
You look amazing.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.533
From that first night I met you,
when you rescued me,

30:57.667 --> 31:01.066
I saw a light inside you
that has never dimmed.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.734
And on this Christmas Eve,
I will keep my promise

31:03.867 --> 31:06.633
of a lifetime of Christmases together.

31:06.767 --> 31:08.633
I will always come home to you, Danielle.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.900
And I promise to always laugh
at your jokes.

31:12.033 --> 31:13.500
Liar.

31:14.266 --> 31:15.633
Who would've thought
that a short circuit

31:15.767 --> 31:18.600
would've led to
a love like this.

31:19.667 --> 31:24.266
I cannot wait to walk through
this life with you Colby Aames.

31:29.100 --> 31:30.633
Are you and Pierce
gonna have a wedding?

31:30.767 --> 31:32.033
Yeah, sure.

31:32.166 --> 31:33.433
It'll probably be small.

31:33.567 --> 31:35.100
That sounds boring.

31:35.233 --> 31:37.066
Are you sure you're
not turning 18?

31:38.900 --> 31:40.500
Let's get you into bed.

31:43.767 --> 31:44.967
Glass of wine?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.433
- Do you even have to ask?
- I guess not.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.767
This is the first time
we've actually got to talk

31:50.900 --> 31:52.533
since your big news.

31:52.667 --> 31:53.600
How you feeling?

31:53.734 --> 31:55.300
Good.

31:55.433 --> 31:56.900
A little overwhelmed.

31:57.033 --> 31:59.133
Pierce just brought up
real estate.

31:59.266 --> 32:01.200
Well, that's big.

32:01.333 --> 32:02.200
Are you ready to move?

32:02.333 --> 32:03.333
He's right.

32:03.467 --> 32:06.333
I mean, if we get married
we have to move off base.

32:06.467 --> 32:10.266
And I'm just a little worried
about uprooting Audrey's life.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.533
Not to mention the fact
that after all these years

32:13.667 --> 32:16.367
I still haven't packed up
all of Colby's things.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.367
Do you love Pierce?

32:19.500 --> 32:20.867
I do.

32:50.834 --> 32:51.767
Oh.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.033
Danielle!

32:53.934 --> 32:55.533
Lisa?

33:03.934 --> 33:06.367
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

33:06.500 --> 33:07.467
It's been too long.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.667
I know!

33:08.800 --> 33:10.967
I am so surprised
to see you here.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.834
It's amazing we haven't
run into each other sooner.

33:12.967 --> 33:14.500
You remember Jenny?

33:14.633 --> 33:15.333
She's all grown up now.

33:15.467 --> 33:16.300
Yes, of course.

33:16.433 --> 33:17.467
- Hi!
- Hey.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.200
I was just telling Audrey
about our wedding last night

33:20.333 --> 33:23.000
and how you were the cutest
flower girl.

33:23.133 --> 33:25.266
But look at you now,
you're so beautiful.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.633
Thank you.

33:26.767 --> 33:29.600
I mean, I don't really remember
it but I've seen the pictures.

33:29.734 --> 33:32.700
Uh, Jenny, would you mind
helping Henry with the drinks?

33:33.100 --> 33:34.266
Can you sit down
for a minute?

33:34.400 --> 33:35.367
Oh, sure.

33:36.633 --> 33:37.934
How's Audrey doing?

33:38.066 --> 33:39.433
Oh, she's great.

33:39.567 --> 33:40.767
She turns eight tomorrow.

33:40.900 --> 33:43.800
But she still wants to see Santa
today so I haven't lost her yet.

33:43.934 --> 33:44.867
Oh, sweet.

33:45.000 --> 33:45.900
Are you still teaching
on base?

33:46.033 --> 33:47.667
Yeah, and I'm co-chairing
the toy drive again

33:47.800 --> 33:49.266
with Sophia again this year.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.867
You should come hang out
with our wives group.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.433
We miss you.

33:52.567 --> 33:53.433
Yeah, I know.

33:53.567 --> 33:56.266
I'm... I'm sorry I haven't
been around to...

33:56.400 --> 34:00.400
It's just... too painful
to see everybody.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.567
Well we all handle
grief differently.

34:03.700 --> 34:04.734
But think about it.

34:04.867 --> 34:08.266
We have dinners
and book club.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.533
We do things with the kids
sometimes too.

34:10.667 --> 34:13.400
It's been hard for them
without their dads.

34:13.533 --> 34:16.400
Audrey has been asking a lot of
questions about Colby lately.

34:16.533 --> 34:17.600
I get it.

34:17.734 --> 34:19.900
Jenny talks about Doug constantly.

34:20.033 --> 34:23.066
I try to keep his memory alive
as best I can.

34:23.200 --> 34:27.033
And Henry's been a great father
figure to her, so...

34:27.166 --> 34:28.200
Henry?

34:28.333 --> 34:30.867
Yeah, sorry, my husband.
I got married.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.066
What? That's wonderful!

34:33.200 --> 34:34.166
Here you go.

34:34.300 --> 34:34.900
Thank you, yeah.

34:35.033 --> 34:37.033
Uh, Henry, this is Danielle.

34:37.166 --> 34:39.033
Her husband was in Doug's unit.

34:39.166 --> 34:40.333
It's nice to meet you.

34:40.467 --> 34:41.367
You too.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.533
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.934
Yeah, four months ago
on the beach at sunset.

34:46.066 --> 34:49.200
It was small but sweet.

34:49.333 --> 34:50.300
Hi.

34:50.433 --> 34:52.734
Sorry it took me so long
to find a parking spot.

34:52.867 --> 34:54.266
The Christmas rush is on, people.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.700
It is pure madness out there. Hi.

34:56.834 --> 34:58.367
Um... Pierce, this is Henry.

34:58.500 --> 35:02.100
And you might remember Lisa
and Jenny from my, uh, wedding.

35:02.233 --> 35:05.066
Yes. Yes, of course. Hi.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.433
These two just got married.

35:06.567 --> 35:07.500
Congratulations.

35:07.633 --> 35:08.233
Thanks.

35:08.367 --> 35:11.333
Oh, wait... are you two...?

35:11.467 --> 35:13.600
Engaged... yes.

35:13.734 --> 35:16.133
Yes, it's so new, just happened
the other day, so...

35:16.266 --> 35:18.000
This is great news!

35:18.133 --> 35:21.767
So, when's the big day?
Or is it too soon?

35:21.900 --> 35:23.600
- We...
- We haven't decided yet.

35:23.734 --> 35:25.266
No. Yeah.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.600
Well, you know, it took us
the longest time

35:26.734 --> 35:28.734
to get settled on a day
when we got engaged.

35:28.867 --> 35:30.000
Really?

35:30.133 --> 35:32.900
It's a big moment, so you know,
we took our time with it.

35:33.033 --> 35:34.500
Oh, a few of the families
are coming over

35:34.633 --> 35:37.066
for our annual smores and
movie night tonight.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.633
We're gonna watch some
Christmas classics.

35:38.767 --> 35:39.333
Are you free?

35:39.467 --> 35:40.367
Uhh...

35:40.500 --> 35:43.000
We could go when I get off work,
if you want.

35:43.133 --> 35:44.467
- Yeah.
- Mmmhmm.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.934
Yeah, okay.
It sounds good.

35:49.633 --> 35:51.300
Hey. Don't say anything
but I think the boss

35:51.433 --> 35:53.600
wants to throw you a surprise
engagement party.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.166
What? Seriously?

35:55.300 --> 35:56.567
- Yeah.
- When?

35:56.700 --> 35:58.166
Oh, sometime in the new year.

35:58.300 --> 36:00.500
He wants this place to be one
big happy family, you know?

36:00.633 --> 36:03.667
Yeah, that's great but...

36:03.800 --> 36:06.033
you know how I feel about surprises.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.367
That's why I'm telling you.
Just act like you don't know.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.834
Okay. I'll do my best.

36:10.967 --> 36:13.066
Come on, Pierce.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.400
You deserve to celebrate.

36:15.533 --> 36:16.400
You finally met the one.

36:16.533 --> 36:18.066
Hey, if we're half as happy
as you and Susan

36:18.200 --> 36:19.633
it'll be a good life.

36:19.767 --> 36:21.667
It's gonna be a great life.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.967
Yeah. I hope so.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.033
Everything's good, right?

36:26.166 --> 36:27.467
Yeah.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.066
It's just... it's a little
complicated, you know?

36:31.200 --> 36:32.633
With Colby.

36:32.767 --> 36:34.000
One minute I think
she's over him,

36:34.133 --> 36:35.033
the next minute
it feels like

36:35.166 --> 36:36.633
he might as well be standing
right next to me.

36:36.767 --> 36:38.166
We met one of her
old friends today

36:38.300 --> 36:40.633
and she didn't even tell her
that we were engaged.

36:40.767 --> 36:42.400
I just thought
she'd be more excited.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.533
It's the holidays, right?

36:44.667 --> 36:46.734
Everybody's got a million
things going on in their minds.

36:46.867 --> 36:48.667
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.633
I'm actually gonna meet some
of her old friends tonight

36:50.767 --> 36:51.633
so I'm looking forward
to that.

36:51.767 --> 36:52.867
See?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.400
Look, buddy, focus on having
a good Christmas together.

36:56.533 --> 36:57.533
As a family.

36:57.667 --> 36:59.233
Thanks, man.

36:59.367 --> 37:01.033
That looks really good.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.133
- You wanna trade?
- Uh...

37:08.233 --> 37:13.633
♪ The first Noel
the angel... ♪

37:13.767 --> 37:15.033
I'm gonna go up front.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.467
We'll save your spot.

37:16.967 --> 37:18.400
So how'd the shopping go?

37:18.533 --> 37:20.600
Oh, I got the most adorable
little red sparkly boots

37:20.734 --> 37:22.200
with bows for Audrey.

37:22.333 --> 37:23.633
Oh! Too cute.

37:23.767 --> 37:25.400
I ran into Lisa Johnson today.

37:25.533 --> 37:27.133
Lisa. That's a name
from the past.

37:27.266 --> 37:27.867
How's she doing?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.367
Great. She just got married.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.467
Good for her.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.300
She must've been so happy
about your engagement.

37:33.433 --> 37:34.166
She was.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.467
But it... it was
a little awkward.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.467
Why?

37:36.600 --> 37:37.600
Well, I forgot to tell her
about it at first

37:37.734 --> 37:42.066
and then she saw my ring...
in front of Pierce.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.533
And I think he was
a little hurt

37:43.667 --> 37:44.800
that I hadn't mentioned
it earlier.

37:44.934 --> 37:46.700
Why didn't you say anything?

37:46.834 --> 37:49.066
I think maybe I was a little
thrown off by running into Lisa.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.400
Soph, I was just telling Audrey
last night about her

37:51.533 --> 37:53.867
and then she shows up
at the coffee shop today...

37:54.000 --> 37:54.734
out of the blue.

37:54.867 --> 37:56.633
Lisa lives in town,
doesn't she?

37:56.767 --> 37:59.400
Yeah, but I haven't seen her
since the funerals.

37:59.533 --> 38:01.533
What are the odds?

38:01.667 --> 38:04.867
Dani, this isn't another sign,
is it?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.867
I... I don't know what's
happening to me.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.633
Should I be worried?

38:10.767 --> 38:12.367
I'm just confused.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.700
Hey, you should talk to Lisa.

38:13.834 --> 38:17.867
If anyone can understand what
you're going through it's her.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.633
She did invite me to a smores
and movie night

38:19.767 --> 38:21.200
with some of the families tonight.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.500
You should go!

38:22.633 --> 38:24.767
I am. We are.

38:24.900 --> 38:27.533
Pierce actually said yes before
I had a chance to respond.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.533
Well, he did you a favor.

38:29.667 --> 38:30.967
My turn!

38:31.100 --> 38:33.867
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

38:34.000 --> 38:38.433
Just don't put the brakes on the
future in search of your past.

38:38.567 --> 38:39.967
What's your name?

38:40.100 --> 38:43.200
Audrey! I'm turning
eight tomorrow.

38:43.333 --> 38:44.600
Happy birthday!

38:44.734 --> 38:47.500
Now, what do you want
for Christmas?

38:47.633 --> 38:51.567
Can you make my bear sing
again with my daddy's voice?

38:53.467 --> 38:58.400
That might be tough.
We'll do the best we can.

39:00.467 --> 39:01.900
Audrey, honey, why don't
we get going?

39:02.033 --> 39:03.867
There are other kids
in line.

39:07.567 --> 39:09.200
Thank you, Santa.

39:16.066 --> 39:17.967
Oh, I'm so glad you made it!

39:18.100 --> 39:18.967
Hi.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.066
- Hi Pierce.
- Hi.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.266
- Merry Christmas, Audrey!
- Merry Christmas.

39:25.467 --> 39:27.000
Audrey, this is Mrs. Johnson.

39:27.133 --> 39:28.934
Her daughter was the flower girl
in Mommy's wedding photo

39:29.066 --> 39:30.633
that I showed you.

39:30.767 --> 39:32.433
I hear it's someone's
birthday tomorrow.

39:32.567 --> 39:34.000
Me!

39:34.133 --> 39:36.467
Double the December presents!
Aren't you lucky?

39:36.600 --> 39:38.967
Come on Audrey, let's go get
the stuff for your smores.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.333
Have you ever tried them
with peppermint?

39:40.467 --> 39:42.567
Oh.

39:42.700 --> 39:44.233
This is really nice.
I'm glad we came.

39:44.367 --> 39:47.066
Yeah, this is great.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.433
You know, I'm really
looking forward

39:48.567 --> 39:50.100
to making our
own traditions.

39:53.567 --> 39:54.233
You know what?

39:54.367 --> 39:56.567
Let's go ahead
and pick a date.

39:56.700 --> 40:00.233
June weddings always look
so perfect in magazines.

40:00.367 --> 40:03.633
Okay. June it is then.

40:03.767 --> 40:05.333
And let's talk to your
real estate friend.

40:05.467 --> 40:07.133
We can start looking
at some places.

40:07.266 --> 40:09.400
Okay, now that calls for
some mulled wine.

40:42.066 --> 40:44.767
Okay everyone,
it's movie time!

40:46.800 --> 40:48.166
I'll meet you inside.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.300
- Yeah.
- Ready, let's go.

40:50.767 --> 40:52.834
This is going to be
so much fun.

40:54.533 --> 40:57.233
Hey... can I ask you
a quick question?

40:57.367 --> 40:58.934
Mm-hm. Here, have a seat.

40:59.066 --> 41:04.000
Um... was it hard for you
to say yes to Henry

41:04.133 --> 41:07.533
with everything
you've been through?

41:07.667 --> 41:10.300
It was hard just to say yes
to coffee.

41:10.433 --> 41:12.633
Everything reminded me
of Doug.

41:12.767 --> 41:14.633
I'd smell his cologne.

41:14.767 --> 41:17.033
I'd see his face
in every Marine.

41:17.166 --> 41:19.834
I felt like I was betraying
him somehow.

41:19.967 --> 41:21.867
That's kind of how
I've been feeling.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.700
It's part of the process
when you lose someone.

41:24.834 --> 41:27.667
Henry and I actually met
at a support group.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.367
He lost his wife

41:29.500 --> 41:32.066
and we were going through a lot
of the same things.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.033
Wow.

41:34.767 --> 41:36.633
Pierce and I decided
to pick a date

41:36.767 --> 41:40.500
and I wanna be more excited
about it but...

41:40.633 --> 41:42.800
I feel like something's
holding me back.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.834
I get it.

41:44.967 --> 41:48.333
The first time I saw Doug
in uniform...

41:48.467 --> 41:53.467
I thought my heart was gonna
leap out of my chest.

41:53.600 --> 41:58.233
The world stopped.

41:58.367 --> 42:01.300
I love Henry.

42:01.433 --> 42:02.633
It's just different.

42:02.767 --> 42:05.400
He's a good man.

42:05.533 --> 42:08.066
He's a great father.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.934
And he's an accountant
who comes home every night.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.066
Well, that is definitely a perk.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.100
Yes.

42:14.233 --> 42:15.734
That and getting your taxes
done for free.

42:15.867 --> 42:16.633
Oh, so true.

42:18.767 --> 42:21.300
I think the challenge
to finding love again

42:21.433 --> 42:25.233
is realizing that no two
relationships are the same.

42:25.367 --> 42:27.266
I am so glad you said that.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.567
'Cause sometimes I feel like
I'm two different people.

42:29.700 --> 42:32.900
One person with Colby
and another one with Pierce.

42:33.033 --> 42:35.066
This is why you need to come
hang out with the wives again!

42:35.200 --> 42:36.400
We talk about all this stuff.

42:36.533 --> 42:38.200
Maybe I should.

42:38.333 --> 42:43.967
But listen, everything you're
feeling is completely normal.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.800
Enjoy your engagement.

42:45.934 --> 42:47.700
Pierce is a catch.

42:54.066 --> 42:57.266
Okay... hop in there, kiddo.

42:57.867 --> 42:58.767
Hi Star.

42:58.900 --> 43:01.166
Okay bud, let's lay down.

43:01.300 --> 43:02.033
Good boy.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.667
Oh, thank you.

43:03.800 --> 43:06.467
Alright, there we go.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.333
It's your big birthday
party tomorrow.

43:08.467 --> 43:09.467
You excited?

43:09.600 --> 43:10.633
So excited!

43:10.767 --> 43:12.266
What time was I born at?

43:12.400 --> 43:15.333
Well, you were born at 11:55 AM.

43:15.467 --> 43:17.333
Can you tell me more
about that day?

43:17.467 --> 43:19.333
Well, it was almost Christmas.

43:19.467 --> 43:24.133
You were early and Mommy
was not ready.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.700
Good morning.

43:26.834 --> 43:28.033
Let's take a look at
your forecast.

43:28.166 --> 43:30.266
We can expect up to
18 inches of snow,

43:30.400 --> 43:32.834
approaching the all-time
record for Virginia.

43:32.967 --> 43:35.633
Folks, this could leave us with
a blanket of the white stuff

43:35.767 --> 43:37.667
that could last until Christmas.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.600
Did you just hear that?

43:39.734 --> 43:41.700
Colby's plane is supposed
to land any minute.

43:41.834 --> 43:42.533
They're the military.

43:42.667 --> 43:43.800
I'm sure they can
land anywhere.

43:43.934 --> 43:44.867
Ah!

43:45.000 --> 43:46.500
Please tell me that's too many
Christmas cookies

43:46.633 --> 43:47.667
and not a contraction.

43:47.800 --> 43:50.200
Ah! I don't know, I mean
I've never done this before.

43:50.333 --> 43:51.433
I'm gonna drive you
to the hospital.

43:51.567 --> 43:52.467
Ah!

43:52.600 --> 43:55.033
No! You are a terrible driver
in the snow.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.333
Okay. I won't take
that personally.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.767
Jane... I think my water
just broke.

44:00.900 --> 44:02.066
Okay, I'm gonna call
the ambulance.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.767
Hello?

44:04.900 --> 44:05.934
My sister is in labor.

44:06.066 --> 44:10.166
I need an ambulance to 4843
Flagtop Drive on base.

44:10.300 --> 44:12.166
I understand.
Please hurry.

44:12.300 --> 44:13.066
Ah!

44:13.200 --> 44:14.433
They're coming as fast
as possible

44:14.567 --> 44:15.400
but the roads
are really bad.

44:15.533 --> 44:17.533
Um... call Colby.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.567
Hello?

44:21.700 --> 44:22.934
Colby? Did you land?

44:23.066 --> 44:23.900
I can't hear you!

44:24.033 --> 44:25.266
Did you land?

44:25.400 --> 44:27.200
Yes. Jane, is Danielle okay?

44:27.333 --> 44:28.700
She's having the baby!

44:28.834 --> 44:29.667
She had the baby?!

44:29.800 --> 44:32.533
Colby! It's happening!
My water broke.

44:32.667 --> 44:34.400
Don't worry,
I'm coming to you.

44:34.533 --> 44:36.533
I'll get you to the hospital.

44:47.633 --> 44:48.767
Where is
the ambulance?

44:48.900 --> 44:49.834
I don't know.

44:49.967 --> 44:51.100
Where's Colby?

44:51.233 --> 44:52.600
The snow hasn't stopped.

44:55.467 --> 44:56.533
It's Colby.

44:58.834 --> 44:59.433
I'm here.

44:59.567 --> 45:00.934
- Oh!
- Let's go. Come on.

45:01.066 --> 45:03.300
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

45:04.934 --> 45:06.567
Look at her.

45:06.700 --> 45:09.467
Have you ever seen anything
so perfect?

45:09.600 --> 45:11.567
She's us.

45:11.700 --> 45:14.166
Beautiful like her mother.

45:14.300 --> 45:17.066
And patient like her daddy.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.533
Thank goodness she waited.

45:21.266 --> 45:24.200
It'll be our first Christmas
together as a family.

45:28.066 --> 45:29.633
Your daddy was always
saving the day.

45:29.767 --> 45:32.567
He could get out of any jam.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.033
Mommy?

45:34.567 --> 45:35.600
Yes, sorry honey.

45:35.734 --> 45:37.400
I was just thinking about
all the things I have to do

45:37.533 --> 45:38.967
for your birthday
party tomorrow.

45:39.100 --> 45:40.667
You better get some sleep.

45:40.800 --> 45:44.667
Falling asleep... now.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.800
Good night, honey.

45:53.734 --> 45:55.500
And the weather
is next...

45:56.233 --> 45:58.233
Sometimes we in
the weather business

45:58.367 --> 45:59.633
get things wrong.

45:59.767 --> 46:02.367
This snowstorm seems to have
come out of nowhere.

46:02.500 --> 46:06.667
And get this, it'll disappear
just as fast as it came.

46:17.700 --> 46:19.600
What is happening?

46:32.700 --> 46:35.300
♪ Jingle bells,
jingle bells,

46:35.433 --> 46:38.333

46:55.066 --> 46:57.100
Snowsuits and boots off.

46:57.233 --> 47:00.900
Ah, everybody... who is ready
to decorate some cookies?

47:01.033 --> 47:03.133

47:17.100 --> 47:18.333
Do you have the candles?

47:18.467 --> 47:19.667
Yes.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.367
Like... 16 candles?

47:24.000 --> 47:24.767
Danielle?

47:24.900 --> 47:26.000
You're a million miles
away again.

47:26.133 --> 47:28.200
What's going on?

47:28.333 --> 47:29.367
Sorry, I was just, uh...

47:29.500 --> 47:32.066
I was just thinking about
the snowstorm this morning.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.066
Yeah, what about it?

47:34.200 --> 47:35.667
Well, we live in Virginia.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.734
We hardly ever get weather
like this in December.

47:37.867 --> 47:39.300
It's winter.
These things happen.

47:39.433 --> 47:41.000
I know, but...

47:41.133 --> 47:42.800
Last night Audrey and I
were talking about

47:42.934 --> 47:44.633
the day she was born.

47:44.767 --> 47:46.567
Do you remember how bad
the weather was that day?

47:46.700 --> 47:48.967
You almost didn't make it
to the hospital in time.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.500
Where are you going
with this?

47:50.633 --> 47:53.533
Don't you think it's strange?

47:53.667 --> 47:58.400
That of all days, today,
all this snow.

47:58.533 --> 48:03.433
It's like the universe or...
or Colby is speaking to me.

48:03.567 --> 48:07.033
And saying what exactly?

48:07.166 --> 48:09.133
Has it ever bothered you
they found every Marine

48:09.266 --> 48:12.467
in Colby's unit except him?

48:12.600 --> 48:16.066
Because it bothers me.

48:16.200 --> 48:20.400
Sweetie... please don't go
down this road again.

48:20.533 --> 48:22.300
You're doing so well.

48:22.433 --> 48:24.200
I just wish I had closure.

48:24.333 --> 48:25.900
You know, like
the other families.

48:26.033 --> 48:28.934
Not knowing where Colby
is still?

48:29.066 --> 48:31.066
Look, I can't even pretend
to understand

48:31.200 --> 48:33.066
how hard this is for you.

48:33.200 --> 48:35.600
But we know he's not alive.

48:35.734 --> 48:40.433
What if he's trying
to tell me something?

48:40.567 --> 48:42.700
Like he's still alive...

48:42.834 --> 48:44.600
Danielle?

48:44.734 --> 48:50.100
Let's say he did survive
the actual crash.

48:50.233 --> 48:51.166
What happened next?

48:51.300 --> 48:52.934
They went down in the Gulf
of Aden, that's...

48:53.066 --> 48:56.066
that's bigger than
the state of Florida.

48:56.200 --> 49:01.133
Well, well... we've, we've all
seen Cast Away and he survived.

49:01.266 --> 49:03.600
That was a movie, Danielle.

49:03.734 --> 49:05.633
People don't actually survive
on deserted islands

49:05.767 --> 49:08.600
talking to basketballs
in real life.

49:08.734 --> 49:11.100
It was a volleyball.

49:11.233 --> 49:13.867
Why don't you go speak
to my dad again.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.633
What did he say back
when it happened?

49:16.767 --> 49:19.200
He told me everything
he could.

49:19.333 --> 49:20.633
Well talk to him again.

49:20.767 --> 49:22.500
Doesn't he have an entire
military base to run?

49:22.633 --> 49:25.600
Not deal with my problems.

49:25.734 --> 49:28.600
He's in charge of
a thousand Marines.

49:28.734 --> 49:31.266
He's heard it all before, okay?

49:31.400 --> 49:34.800
And besides...
you're like family.

49:34.934 --> 49:36.900
Maybe it could help.

49:47.300 --> 49:48.200
Alright.

49:48.333 --> 49:49.300
It's almost time!

49:49.433 --> 49:50.033
Hi.

49:50.166 --> 49:51.467
Auntie Jane,
you made it!

49:51.600 --> 49:53.000
I got someone to cover for me
at the hospital.

49:53.133 --> 49:54.667
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.033
Perfect timing.

49:57.166 --> 49:58.367
You ready?

49:58.500 --> 49:59.433
Yeah?

49:59.567 --> 50:05.433
♪ Happy birthday to you.

50:05.567 --> 50:11.166
♪ Happy birthday to you.

50:11.300 --> 50:17.300
♪ Happy birthday,
dear Audrey. ♪

50:17.433 --> 50:22.834
♪ Happy birthday to you.

50:24.000 --> 50:24.767
Go, go, go!

50:24.900 --> 50:25.367
Last one!

50:25.500 --> 50:26.567
One more, one more!

50:26.834 --> 50:28.000
Yay!

50:36.400 --> 50:37.133
Okay, Audrey.

50:37.266 --> 50:40.600
Before I go I have
one more gift.

50:40.734 --> 50:43.166
'Kay? Close your eyes.

50:43.300 --> 50:45.533
Oh... do not look.

50:45.667 --> 50:47.166
Okay. Open 'em!

50:48.567 --> 50:51.433
- Wow
- It's beautiful!

50:51.567 --> 50:53.200
It's blue topaz,
it's your birthstone.

50:53.333 --> 50:54.433
Brilliant, icy blue.

50:54.567 --> 50:55.600
I love it.

50:55.734 --> 50:57.200
May I put it on you?

50:59.166 --> 51:00.600
Here, let me help, honey.

51:02.900 --> 51:03.934
There you go.

51:04.066 --> 51:05.800
Oh... wow.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.066
Let me see.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.066
Aww.

51:10.200 --> 51:11.200
It looks so good.

51:11.333 --> 51:13.166
Why don't you go wash up?
I'll be right behind you.

51:13.300 --> 51:14.200
Oh...

51:19.900 --> 51:22.233
That was so thoughtful
of you.

51:22.367 --> 51:23.266
You know what?

51:23.400 --> 51:26.333
I actually had a lot of fun
shopping for her.

51:26.467 --> 51:29.500
Hey, um... what were you and
Sophia talking about earlier?

51:29.633 --> 51:30.600
When?

51:30.734 --> 51:32.567
Uh... in the hallway
when she brought the cake.

51:32.700 --> 51:34.567
It seemed a little intense.

51:35.967 --> 51:36.934
Right.

51:37.066 --> 51:41.400
Um... remember I told you
about all the memories

51:41.533 --> 51:43.734
and things I've been
going through lately?

51:43.867 --> 51:44.767
Yeah.

51:44.900 --> 51:46.800
Things have been happening.

51:47.467 --> 51:50.734
Like signs... or something.

51:50.867 --> 51:52.400
Maybe it's
because of Christmas

51:52.533 --> 51:55.600
or because Audrey's been asking
more questions about her dad.

51:55.734 --> 51:57.667
It's got me out of sorts.

51:57.800 --> 52:00.567
And I am so sorry,
it's not fair to you.

52:00.700 --> 52:02.400
Hey, no, that's okay.

52:02.533 --> 52:04.133
How can I help?

52:04.266 --> 52:07.333
I love that you're always here
for me.

52:07.467 --> 52:08.633
Right now I...

52:08.767 --> 52:10.233
I know it's a lot to ask

52:10.367 --> 52:12.967
but maybe just if you could just
have some patience with me.

52:13.100 --> 52:16.500
Yeah. Yeah.

52:16.633 --> 52:19.166
I'm gonna go talk to General
Anderson about the crash.

52:19.300 --> 52:20.300
Is there something new?

52:20.433 --> 52:21.900
I don't know.

52:22.033 --> 52:24.500
I haven't checked in with him
in a while.

52:24.633 --> 52:27.567
Since they never found Colby
I thought I would...

52:27.700 --> 52:30.500
ask some questions,
get an update.

52:30.633 --> 52:32.633
Oh. Okay.

52:34.934 --> 52:37.133
Danielle... are we okay?

52:37.266 --> 52:38.433
Yeah.

52:38.567 --> 52:39.767
I think so.

52:39.900 --> 52:41.000
I mean, yes.

52:41.133 --> 52:43.133
Hey... of course.

52:43.266 --> 52:46.133
It's just something I need
to do for myself.

52:49.467 --> 52:50.967
Thank you.

52:51.533 --> 52:53.100
Of course.

52:54.633 --> 52:57.000
Only five more days
'til Christmas.

52:57.133 --> 53:01.133
Daddy brought me this bear
for my birthday, didn't he?

53:01.266 --> 53:03.066
Yeah, he did.

53:03.200 --> 53:07.967
He sat right in that chair
and recorded "Silent Night".

53:08.100 --> 53:11.066
Why doesn't my bear
play anymore?

53:11.200 --> 53:15.033
Probably 'cause we played it
too much.

53:15.166 --> 53:18.967
Well, maybe it just needs
new batteries.

53:19.100 --> 53:22.834
I already tried that
but I'll try again.

53:26.300 --> 53:28.567
You know what?

53:28.700 --> 53:31.867
Why don't... why don't I sing
to you tonight?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Okay.

53:36.533 --> 53:41.467
♪ Silent night

53:41.600 --> 53:46.066
♪ Holy night

53:46.200 --> 53:50.800
♪ All is calm

53:50.934 --> 53:54.967
♪ All is bright

53:55.100 --> 54:03.300
♪ Round yon virgin,

54:13.400 --> 54:15.100
Why won't you work?

54:15.900 --> 54:17.300
Ugh.

54:17.967 --> 54:20.500
And why am I talking to
a bear?

54:26.767 --> 54:28.133
Thank you.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.000
Merry Christmas.

54:30.133 --> 54:31.433
Merry Christmas, General.

54:31.567 --> 54:32.533
Have a seat.

54:33.967 --> 54:36.467
It's nice to have someone
to talk to who doesn't
have to salute me.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.834
I hear you got engaged
to Pierce Hammond.

54:38.967 --> 54:39.600
Oh...

54:39.734 --> 54:41.600
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

54:41.734 --> 54:42.433
When's the big day?

54:42.567 --> 54:43.800
Next June we think.

54:43.934 --> 54:45.767
Audrey and I are gonna be
moving off base.

54:45.900 --> 54:47.533
You'll keep teaching
for us though, right?

54:47.667 --> 54:49.333
I'm still sorting things out.

54:49.467 --> 54:51.100
I hope so.

54:51.233 --> 54:54.834
Sophia says you have questions
about Colby's incident.

54:54.967 --> 54:55.700
I do.

54:55.834 --> 54:58.166
May I ask why
the questions now?

54:58.300 --> 54:59.367
It's been over three years.

54:59.500 --> 55:02.600
Well, Audrey has her
Christmas father-daughter dance

55:02.734 --> 55:05.367
coming up and it's brought up
a lot of discussions.

55:05.500 --> 55:06.934
I'm sure it has.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.367
Sir, I remember the day
you pulled into our driveway

55:10.500 --> 55:12.400
like it was yesterday.

55:12.533 --> 55:13.567
I admired your strength.

55:13.700 --> 55:14.734
Thank you.

55:14.867 --> 55:16.533
I tried for Audrey.

55:17.867 --> 55:22.567
When it happened, I was
so full of grief.

55:22.700 --> 55:25.934
It was all I could do to keep
my head above water.

55:26.066 --> 55:29.266
I was not thinking clearly
at all.

55:29.400 --> 55:35.233
So could you please describe to
me again exactly what happened?

55:35.367 --> 55:37.867
Well, it was nighttime
when a surface to air missile

55:38.000 --> 55:40.367
hit the aircraft over
the Gulf of Aden.

55:40.500 --> 55:42.667
Nine men from the unit
and two pilots were found

55:42.800 --> 55:43.667
strapped in their seats.

55:43.800 --> 55:46.367
Colby was not in the plane,
as you know.

55:46.500 --> 55:50.200
Is it at all possible
he was captured?

55:50.333 --> 55:52.900
The insurgents publicly
claimed responsibility

55:53.033 --> 55:55.233
for all the deaths.

55:55.367 --> 55:59.233
Maybe they didn't know
Colby was there?

55:59.367 --> 56:02.433
Um... what if he swam
to safety somehow?

56:02.567 --> 56:04.600
The aircraft was found
miles offshore.

56:04.734 --> 56:06.934
I mean, the most likely outcome

56:07.066 --> 56:09.967
is that he was swept
into the open water.

56:10.100 --> 56:15.433
I thought I was okay
about Colby's passing but...

56:15.567 --> 56:16.600
I don't know.

56:16.734 --> 56:18.233
Something doesn't feel right.

56:18.367 --> 56:21.500
Danielle, I'm sorry but every
piece of intelligence

56:21.633 --> 56:24.333
tells us that Colby's gone.

56:24.467 --> 56:28.400
That's why the military
officially declared him dead.

56:28.533 --> 56:30.900
Colby was a hero.

56:31.033 --> 56:33.734
Embrace the good memories
you had with him...

56:33.867 --> 56:38.100
and share those with Audrey.

56:38.233 --> 56:41.767
I think this is exactly
what I needed to hear.

56:49.266 --> 56:50.500
There's my girl!

56:50.633 --> 56:51.600
Hi Sergeant.

56:51.734 --> 56:52.100
Hi mom.

56:54.300 --> 56:57.066
I did not think this place
could get more festive.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.300
We aim to please!

56:59.433 --> 57:00.667
How'd it go with my dad?

57:00.800 --> 57:02.533
Good.

57:02.667 --> 57:04.133
It was stuff I had
heard before

57:04.266 --> 57:06.500
but he really helped
put it into perspective.

57:06.633 --> 57:08.133
I'm so happy to hear that.

57:08.266 --> 57:10.567
So we're done with
the cosmic Christmas?

57:10.700 --> 57:12.233
Yes.

57:12.367 --> 57:16.200
Like you said... coincidences.

57:17.367 --> 57:19.700
Mommy, I wrapped
so many toys.

57:19.834 --> 57:21.000
Nice!

57:21.133 --> 57:22.500
Did you have fun
with Sophia?

57:23.967 --> 57:25.200
Wait a minute.

57:25.333 --> 57:26.266
Ah... let me guess.

57:26.400 --> 57:29.000
Candy canes, candy canes
and more candy canes.

57:29.133 --> 57:31.133
That is classified information.

57:31.266 --> 57:33.533
- It's also a tongue twister.
- Yup.

57:33.667 --> 57:35.333
Can Sophia come over tonight?

57:35.467 --> 57:37.200
Oh, I actually have a date.

57:37.333 --> 57:38.867
Who is the lucky fella?

57:39.000 --> 57:40.567
You know the football coach
at school?

57:40.700 --> 57:41.500
His brother.

57:41.633 --> 57:42.567
That's a random connection.

57:42.700 --> 57:44.500
Let's hope it's
a love connection.

57:44.633 --> 57:46.467
He's taking me to an ugly
Christmas sweater party

57:46.600 --> 57:48.066
with his friends.

57:48.200 --> 57:50.300
And if it goes bad, I'm going to
text you the code word 'jingle'

57:50.433 --> 57:51.500
and you're gonna call me
right away

57:51.633 --> 57:53.467
with something very important
you need my help with.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.967
Do not listen to that.

57:56.667 --> 57:58.800
You, my dear, are gonna stay
home with Auntie Jane

57:58.934 --> 58:01.100
'cause Mommy is going to
Pierce's holiday work party.

58:01.233 --> 58:01.900
Yay!

58:02.033 --> 58:04.066
Oh, well don't miss me
too much.

58:08.166 --> 58:10.133
So, I... I told your dad
how we're going to be

58:10.266 --> 58:12.533
leaving the base and how Pierce
is already looking for houses

58:12.667 --> 58:14.867
and a new school for Audrey.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.934
Wait, you're not gonna keep
her at the base school?

58:17.066 --> 58:18.967
It feels like we need
a fresh start.

58:19.100 --> 58:20.800
You're still gonna teach here, right?

58:20.934 --> 58:22.266
And the toy drive?

58:22.400 --> 58:24.734
There are so many
memories here.

58:24.867 --> 58:26.567
I think we need
to move forward.

58:26.700 --> 58:28.567
But you love the school...

58:28.700 --> 58:31.767
and you've made such an impact
on the kids and the community.

58:31.900 --> 58:34.533
Maybe I can do that
with new kids.

58:34.667 --> 58:36.934
Find a new place
to volunteer.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Yeah.

58:44.934 --> 58:46.633
We are so excited
for you two.

58:46.767 --> 58:48.700
- Aw, thank you.
- Thank you.

58:48.834 --> 58:50.800
Yes, I'm a very lucky man.

58:51.767 --> 58:53.400
Oh... yes!

58:53.734 --> 58:54.934
Pierce has good taste.

58:55.066 --> 58:56.467
Doesn't he?

58:56.600 --> 58:57.800
So where's the honeymoon?

58:57.934 --> 58:59.867
The best part about
getting married.

59:00.066 --> 59:01.834
We have not figured
that out yet.

59:01.967 --> 59:03.967
I've been looking at some
beach destinations actually.

59:04.100 --> 59:05.767
There's nothing better
than relaxing on a beach

59:05.900 --> 59:08.367
with a good book, right?

59:08.934 --> 59:12.667
So, thank you for another
great year.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.834
From the designers
to the sales team.

59:14.967 --> 59:16.633
You're the best
in the business.

59:16.767 --> 59:21.667
And we should be so proud of
how much this company has grown.

59:21.800 --> 59:23.000
Whoo!

59:24.500 --> 59:25.367
Now, I can't leave you

59:25.500 --> 59:27.767
without one of my signature
Christmas jokes.

59:27.900 --> 59:29.333
Oh boy.

59:29.467 --> 59:32.667
What did the gingerbread man
put on his bed?

59:33.667 --> 59:35.166
A cookie sheet!

59:35.500 --> 59:36.767
We have a winner!

59:37.934 --> 59:39.166
Pierce, she's a keeper!

59:40.467 --> 59:42.033
Alright, everyone have
a great night.

59:42.166 --> 59:42.900
Merry Christmas!

59:43.033 --> 59:44.867
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

59:47.500 --> 59:49.333
I'm sorry, his jokes
are so annoying.

59:49.467 --> 59:50.934
Thank you for indulging him.

59:51.066 --> 59:53.066
I actually thought it was
kinda funny.

59:55.233 --> 59:56.000
You know what?

59:56.133 --> 59:56.834
I'm going to go use
the restroom.

59:56.967 --> 59:58.867
Sure. I'll get us
another drink.

59:59.000 --> 1:00:00.000
Okay.

1:00:08.066 --> 1:00:09.333
Two more of those.

1:00:11.834 --> 1:00:14.433
Well, Danielle made you
look good with the boss.

1:00:14.567 --> 1:00:16.133
Yeah.

1:00:17.100 --> 1:00:18.333
Everything okay?

1:00:18.467 --> 1:00:21.433
I think so.
I don't know.

1:00:21.567 --> 1:00:23.667
She went to see General
Anderson again today.

1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:24.734
Okay.

1:00:24.867 --> 1:00:26.000
She's been dealing
with a lot of Colby stuff.

1:00:26.133 --> 1:00:26.700
Like what?

1:00:26.834 --> 1:00:29.533
Questions about his death.

1:00:29.667 --> 1:00:31.533
I think a lot of it
is coming from Audrey

1:00:31.667 --> 1:00:34.166
which is stirring up a lot
of old feelings for Danielle.

1:00:34.300 --> 1:00:38.467
Any concern that's code
for cold feet?

1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:41.200
To be honest, I was worried
about that.

1:00:41.333 --> 1:00:42.867
But then Danielle just picked
a wedding date

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:44.934
and she said she wanted
to look for houses together.

1:00:45.066 --> 1:00:46.333
What do you mean?
That's great!

1:00:46.467 --> 1:00:48.033
Sounds like everything's
on track.

1:00:48.166 --> 1:00:49.633
Yeah.

1:00:49.767 --> 1:00:50.967
Yeah, you're right.

1:00:51.100 --> 1:00:52.300
Yeah.

1:00:52.433 --> 1:00:54.667
You know what, I've been meaning
to ask you...

1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:57.000
if you would be my best man.

1:00:57.133 --> 1:00:58.767
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1:00:58.900 --> 1:00:59.767
Yes!

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:03.934
- Awesome, man.
- Thanks, man.

1:01:04.066 --> 1:01:05.700
Did I just hear best man?

1:01:05.834 --> 1:01:06.934
You're looking at him!

1:01:07.066 --> 1:01:09.400
Aw, that's awesome!
Thanks Rick.

1:01:09.533 --> 1:01:11.100
Anything for this guy.

1:01:12.567 --> 1:01:14.767
Oh, actually... is it okay
if we get going?

1:01:14.900 --> 1:01:16.700
There's a couple people
I'd like you to meet actually.

1:01:16.834 --> 1:01:19.400
Well I told Audrey I'd be home
in time to put her to bed.

1:01:19.533 --> 1:01:21.033
And I just got a text
from Sophia,

1:01:21.166 --> 1:01:23.433
she wants me to rescue her
from this date she's on.

1:01:23.567 --> 1:01:26.033
I think it's kind
of a 911 situation.

1:01:26.166 --> 1:01:27.166
Oooh, that bad, huh?

1:01:27.300 --> 1:01:30.600
I am so glad I'm not in
the dating scene anymore.

1:01:30.734 --> 1:01:32.166
Who are you telling?

1:01:32.300 --> 1:01:33.433
When, when Susan and I
were dating,

1:01:33.567 --> 1:01:34.867
it was all flowers and candy.

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.533
Now you need like a million
dating apps

1:01:36.667 --> 1:01:38.066
for every mood, right?

1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:39.734
Thank you for taking me out
of my misery.

1:01:40.700 --> 1:01:42.033
I would never last.

1:01:42.433 --> 1:01:43.600
Okay, let's get you home.

1:01:43.734 --> 1:01:44.567
Oh, great.

1:01:44.700 --> 1:01:45.767
Alright, well good seeing
you, Danielle.

1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:47.367
Aw, you too.

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:48.600
'Night.

1:01:48.734 --> 1:01:49.333
Good night.

1:01:49.467 --> 1:01:50.400
And I will see you tomorrow.

1:01:50.533 --> 1:01:51.734
Last day before
Christmas break.

1:01:51.867 --> 1:01:52.867
Cannot wait.

1:01:58.300 --> 1:02:00.100
Thank you for
a fun evening.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:03.033
Danielle...

1:02:04.166 --> 1:02:06.800
we do not have to go to
the beach for our honeymoon.

1:02:06.934 --> 1:02:08.400
I should've checked
with you.

1:02:08.533 --> 1:02:09.467
I'm so sorry.

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:10.400
It's okay.

1:02:10.533 --> 1:02:12.300
The beach is relaxing,
like you said.

1:02:12.433 --> 1:02:14.600
And I could use
more of that.

1:02:16.133 --> 1:02:18.133
You're not having second
thoughts, are you?

1:02:18.266 --> 1:02:19.467
About the vacation? No.

1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:22.100
No. About getting married.

1:02:22.233 --> 1:02:24.233
No.

1:02:24.367 --> 1:02:26.967
I haven't told you how grateful
I am for you,

1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:28.800
how wonderful you are.

1:02:28.934 --> 1:02:31.400
And how thankful I am
you haven't gone running,

1:02:31.533 --> 1:02:33.266
with all my baggage.

1:02:35.266 --> 1:02:37.166
You are more than worth it.

1:02:37.300 --> 1:02:38.700
Thank you.

1:02:39.300 --> 1:02:40.734
I've been so wrapped up
in my own stuff

1:02:40.867 --> 1:02:43.166
I haven't asked
how you're doing.

1:02:43.300 --> 1:02:45.300
You know what?

1:02:45.433 --> 1:02:47.867
I'm feeling a lot better now.

1:02:48.867 --> 1:02:50.433
I love you, Danielle.

1:02:50.567 --> 1:02:52.000
I love you too.

1:03:00.667 --> 1:03:02.367
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:03:20.667 --> 1:03:21.400
nocks on door]

1:03:21.533 --> 1:03:22.767
Hi honey.

1:03:22.900 --> 1:03:26.200
Seems like you and Auntie Jane
had fun tonight.

1:03:26.667 --> 1:03:30.433
Mommy, when's the last time
you saw Daddy?

1:03:30.567 --> 1:03:31.667
Oh honey, it's late.

1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:33.533
We can talk about
it tomorrow, okay?

1:03:33.667 --> 1:03:37.033
Please Mommy.

1:03:37.166 --> 1:03:40.166
Okay.

1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:44.867
Um... he was on that
last mission overseas

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.934
when he called me.

1:03:47.266 --> 1:03:49.100
We're flying to a new
location tonight.

1:03:49.233 --> 1:03:51.166
Be safe, okay?

1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:53.233
Always.

1:03:53.367 --> 1:03:55.500
I want you and Audrey to know
how much I love you.

1:03:55.633 --> 1:03:56.567
We love you so much.

1:03:56.700 --> 1:03:58.533
Can't wait for you
to get home.

1:03:58.667 --> 1:04:00.433
I left something for you.

1:04:00.567 --> 1:04:03.567
You'll find it in the-

1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:05.633
You... Colby?

1:04:06.100 --> 1:04:07.834
Colby, you're...

1:04:08.934 --> 1:04:10.400
What was it, Mommy?

1:04:10.533 --> 1:04:12.400
I don't know, honey.

1:04:12.533 --> 1:04:15.567
I've replayed that conversation
in my head so many times.

1:04:15.700 --> 1:04:17.300
I remember when Daddy left

1:04:17.433 --> 1:04:19.800
I asked him for a baby
brother or sister.

1:04:19.934 --> 1:04:21.300
He told me yes.

1:04:21.433 --> 1:04:23.000
And then he said he would
move heaven and earth

1:04:23.133 --> 1:04:24.900
to come home to us.

1:04:25.033 --> 1:04:28.166
Maybe he's still trying, Mommy.

1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:32.100
Daddy will always be
with us.

1:04:32.233 --> 1:04:33.967
But right now let's
you and I focus on

1:04:34.100 --> 1:04:35.800
what a great Christmas
we're gonna have.

1:04:35.934 --> 1:04:38.567
'Cause before you know it,
it's gonna be Christmas Eve...

1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:40.900
and guess who's gonna
be here?

1:04:41.033 --> 1:04:44.100
Santa Claus!

1:04:44.633 --> 1:04:46.800
Okay you, tuck in.

1:04:48.133 --> 1:04:48.967
Good night, honey.

1:04:49.100 --> 1:04:50.333
Good night.

1:04:56.633 --> 1:04:59.667
Oh, thank you.

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:01.133
Audrey told me
you've been telling her

1:05:01.266 --> 1:05:02.500
bedtime stories about Colby.

1:05:02.633 --> 1:05:03.500
Yeah.

1:05:03.633 --> 1:05:06.500
I was really struggling
with it at first.

1:05:06.633 --> 1:05:07.767
But now it's easier.

1:05:07.900 --> 1:05:10.166
I actually just told her about
the last time I saw Colby.

1:05:10.300 --> 1:05:12.000
Remember how every time
he deployed he'd tell me

1:05:12.133 --> 1:05:14.867
that if he didn't make it home
he was okay if I moved on.

1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:16.000
Yeah.

1:05:16.133 --> 1:05:19.967
Must've been so hard for him
to say that to you.

1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:22.467
Do you think he would approve
of me and Pierce?

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:23.467
Definitely.

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:25.033
Colby would've wanted you
to be with someone

1:05:25.166 --> 1:05:26.300
that treats you like gold.

1:05:26.433 --> 1:05:27.400
And he does.

1:05:27.533 --> 1:05:32.467
It's just that with Colby
I never had any doubt.

1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:35.500
I didn't know you were
struggling so much.

1:05:35.633 --> 1:05:39.734
Honestly, I have been feeling
a little crazy lately.

1:05:39.867 --> 1:05:42.166
You're the most rational
person I know

1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:45.367
and if you're feeling something,
it's for a good reason.

1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:46.900
Thank you.

1:05:47.633 --> 1:05:49.800
Mind if I go for a quick walk?

1:05:49.934 --> 1:05:53.767
Go for a long walk.
Clear your head.

1:06:26.367 --> 1:06:28.333
I never stopped loving you.

1:06:30.166 --> 1:06:33.266
I can feel you here with me.

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.300
It's almost like the first night
we met.

1:06:40.700 --> 1:06:43.500
I hope you're okay with me
marrying Pierce.

1:06:47.834 --> 1:06:52.467
It's just, it's hard for me
because it feels like...

1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:54.433
like I'm saying goodbye to you.

1:06:56.200 --> 1:06:59.300
Makes us feel so final.

We distributed 10,000
toys this year.

1:07:40.166 --> 1:07:42.633
You and Sophia have
really outdone yourselves.

1:07:42.767 --> 1:07:43.767
Oh, thank you.

1:07:43.900 --> 1:07:47.934
It's because we have the
most incredible volunteers.

1:07:48.066 --> 1:07:50.667
General, I wanna thank you for
being there for me yesterday.

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:51.834
Any time.

1:07:51.967 --> 1:07:54.066
You'll always be a part
of the Marine Corp family.

1:07:55.066 --> 1:07:55.800
Amazing job.

1:07:55.934 --> 1:07:57.166
Thank you.

1:07:59.166 --> 1:08:00.500
Great to be back!

1:08:00.633 --> 1:08:03.567
Oh, it's been so wonderful
seeing everybody.

1:08:03.700 --> 1:08:05.667
I did not realize how much
I missed you all.

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:07.667
Thank you for the impromptu
therapy session.

1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:09.734
Now I'm always here
to talk.

1:08:09.867 --> 1:08:12.433
And you're doing great.

1:08:12.567 --> 1:08:15.667
Hey, uh... you mentioned
a book club.

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:16.400
Mm-hmm.

1:08:16.533 --> 1:08:18.367
I think I need to read more.

1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:20.000
Would you let me know
when the next one is?

1:08:20.133 --> 1:08:22.166
I'd be happy to.

1:08:22.300 --> 1:08:23.200
Merry Christmas, Danielle.

1:08:23.333 --> 1:08:25.834
Merry Christmas.

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.867
It all came out so beautifully.

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:36.900
We make a good team.

1:08:37.033 --> 1:08:38.767
We do.

1:08:38.900 --> 1:08:42.166
I'm gonna miss seeing you every
day if you leave this place.

1:08:42.300 --> 1:08:45.600
I haven't decided what I'm gonna
do yet but if I do go,

1:08:45.734 --> 1:08:47.667
we'll still see each other
all the time, okay?

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:49.233
Do you promise?

1:08:49.367 --> 1:08:50.433
I promise.

1:08:50.567 --> 1:08:53.533
So thanks to all of you
and this amazing community,

1:08:53.667 --> 1:08:55.400
we've helped thousands
of families

1:08:55.533 --> 1:08:57.200
have a special Christmas
this year.

1:09:05.066 --> 1:09:09.133
And before I go, as I look
around this room...

1:09:09.266 --> 1:09:12.967
I'm reminded what Christmas
is all about.

1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:14.233
Family.

1:09:14.367 --> 1:09:16.166
Friends.

1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:19.900
My husband once promised me
a lifetime of Christmases.

1:09:20.033 --> 1:09:23.734
But the truth is none of us know
what tomorrow will bring.

1:09:23.867 --> 1:09:27.066
So, we should embrace
the past.

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:29.900
But being truly present
and in the moment

1:09:30.033 --> 1:09:32.266
with the people you love
the most...

1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:34.800
that's the greatest present
of all.

1:09:39.467 --> 1:09:40.800
Merry Christmas everyone!

1:09:54.367 --> 1:09:55.100
Bye.

1:09:55.233 --> 1:09:56.533
Happy holidays.

1:09:58.033 --> 1:09:58.734
Hey.

1:09:58.867 --> 1:09:59.367
Hi.

1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:01.233
Um... I'm gonna head out.

1:10:01.367 --> 1:10:02.300
Uh... do you wanna grab dinner?

1:10:02.433 --> 1:10:05.567
You know, I've got a few
presents left to wrap

1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:07.066
so, uh, a raincheck?

1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:09.000
Wanna grab coffee at our spot
tomorrow morning?

1:10:09.133 --> 1:10:10.333
Sounds good.

1:10:10.467 --> 1:10:12.166
Mommy, I'm hungry.

1:10:12.300 --> 1:10:16.066
That's because sugar
is not a food group.

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:16.900
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

1:10:17.033 --> 1:10:18.133
Yeah.

1:10:20.467 --> 1:10:21.834
Bye kiddo.

1:10:37.433 --> 1:10:39.300
Oh, my journal.

1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:56.834
What is this?

1:10:58.233 --> 1:10:59.400
"Danielle...

1:10:59.533 --> 1:11:00.800
"I'm writing this note

1:11:00.934 --> 1:11:03.467
"hoping it'll be a nice surprise
one night

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:04.867
"when you're missing me.

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.166
"Even though I'm thousands
of miles away,

1:11:07.300 --> 1:11:10.066
"I'm always thinking of you
and Audrey.

1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:13.166
"I remember what you said
the day I proposed.

1:11:13.300 --> 1:11:15.066
"Follow your heart.

1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:17.166
"Best decision I ever made.

1:11:17.300 --> 1:11:19.000
"Give Audrey a big kiss.

1:11:19.133 --> 1:11:21.367
"I'll deliver your kiss
in person.

1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:22.834
"Love always.

1:11:22.967 --> 1:11:24.867
"Colby."

1:11:30.867 --> 1:11:32.633
I think I found
what Colby left me.

1:11:32.767 --> 1:11:33.400
Really?

1:11:33.533 --> 1:11:35.000
A note in my journal.

1:11:35.133 --> 1:11:37.900
Somehow it got mixed up
with his things when he died.

1:11:38.033 --> 1:11:39.900
What did it say?

1:11:40.033 --> 1:11:41.867
To follow my heart.

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.734
And where is your heart
leading you?

1:11:43.867 --> 1:11:45.100
Good question.

1:11:47.700 --> 1:11:50.433
Why does life have to be
so hard sometimes?

1:11:52.367 --> 1:11:54.500
You'll make the right decision.

1:12:19.066 --> 1:12:21.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:12:28.433 --> 1:12:29.600
You look beautiful as always.

1:12:29.734 --> 1:12:31.066
Oh.

1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:34.000
I got your favorite.

1:12:34.133 --> 1:12:35.300
Thank you.

1:12:36.900 --> 1:12:39.367
- Pierce, I think...
- Danielle, there's something...

1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:40.300
I'm sorry, you go first.

1:12:40.433 --> 1:12:41.834
No, no. Please.

1:12:43.467 --> 1:12:47.934
I've been thinking about
what we both want.

1:12:48.066 --> 1:12:51.266
You know, I'm dreaming
of the perfect house

1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:53.967
and planning for retirement

1:12:54.100 --> 1:12:58.533
whereas I'm not even sure
you're ready to leave the base.

1:12:58.667 --> 1:13:03.533
I wonder if we're in two
different places in our lives.

1:13:03.667 --> 1:13:05.800
I'm wondering the same thing.

1:13:07.834 --> 1:13:12.000
Pierce, I... I want you
to know I wouldn't trade

1:13:12.133 --> 1:13:14.400
what we've had for anything.

1:13:14.533 --> 1:13:15.834
Without your friendship,

1:13:15.967 --> 1:13:19.233
your love over these
past few years...

1:13:19.367 --> 1:13:21.767
I honestly don't know how
I would've made it through.

1:13:21.900 --> 1:13:24.266
I am forever grateful.

1:13:26.166 --> 1:13:28.700
We're good at being friends,
aren't we?

1:13:28.834 --> 1:13:31.433
It's easy to see why we thought
we could be more.

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:34.967
I'm sorry.

1:13:36.867 --> 1:13:39.266
Don't be sorry for being you.

1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:42.233
And I won't be for being me.

1:13:42.367 --> 1:13:43.767
I just, I wanna be
with somebody

1:13:43.900 --> 1:13:47.500
who wants to shout from the
rooftops that we're in love.

1:13:47.633 --> 1:13:49.133
You deserve that.

1:13:53.066 --> 1:13:55.834
Did you still want me
to take Audrey

1:13:55.967 --> 1:13:57.767
to the father-daughter
Christmas dance

1:13:57.900 --> 1:14:00.133
if it's not too awkward?

1:14:00.266 --> 1:14:02.967
Thank you, really.

1:14:03.100 --> 1:14:05.934
But I think I need
to take her myself.

1:14:06.066 --> 1:14:08.400
But I hope you'll still stay
part of our lives.

1:14:08.533 --> 1:14:10.967
Audrey, of course,
adores you.

1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:13.934
Me too.

1:14:14.066 --> 1:14:16.600
You're not gonna get rid of me
that easily.

1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:25.734
Auds... what's going on?

1:14:25.867 --> 1:14:27.734
I don't wanna go to
the dance tonight.

1:14:27.867 --> 1:14:29.767
Aw, honey.

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.767
I know it's been tough lately.

1:14:32.900 --> 1:14:35.266
We've been finally talking
about your daddy

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:38.400
and we should've been doing
that all along.

1:14:38.533 --> 1:14:40.500
That's Mommy's fault.

1:14:40.633 --> 1:14:43.100
I was trying to push
the pain away

1:14:43.233 --> 1:14:45.800
by pretending it wasn't there.

1:14:45.934 --> 1:14:48.834
And I realize now
that wasn't right.

1:14:48.967 --> 1:14:51.233
And I have you to thank
for that.

1:14:51.367 --> 1:14:52.333
Really?

1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:58.734
Honey, there's something else
I wanna talk to you about.

1:14:58.867 --> 1:15:02.200
Pierce and I are not
gonna get married anymore.

1:15:02.333 --> 1:15:04.900
Why? I like Pierce.

1:15:05.033 --> 1:15:06.367
I do too.

1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:10.066
And he cares about you so much,
he always will.

1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:13.700
So, does that mean I don't
have to go to the dance?

1:15:13.834 --> 1:15:18.200
I think we should go like
we planned, together.

1:15:18.333 --> 1:15:22.000
But what if the girl I told you
about says I'm weird?

1:15:22.133 --> 1:15:23.734
What kinda person is she?

1:15:23.867 --> 1:15:26.233
Not a very nice one.

1:15:26.367 --> 1:15:28.533
Exactly.

1:15:28.667 --> 1:15:31.300
You and I are gonna march
through this world together,

1:15:31.433 --> 1:15:33.233
holding hands. Yeah.

1:15:33.367 --> 1:15:35.900
And I am gonna be with you
every step of the way.

1:15:36.033 --> 1:15:37.233
And if I have to tell you
a bedtime story

1:15:37.367 --> 1:15:39.900
about your daddy every night
until you graduate for college,

1:15:40.033 --> 1:15:41.066
I will.

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:42.033
So what do you say?

1:15:42.166 --> 1:15:43.066
Yes.

1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:45.567
You're ready to put
your dancing shoes on?

1:15:45.700 --> 1:15:47.033
Yeah?

1:15:47.166 --> 1:15:48.233
Okay.

1:15:48.367 --> 1:15:49.333
Oh...

1:15:49.467 --> 1:15:51.233
So we're looking at
a white Christmas, folks.

1:15:51.367 --> 1:15:54.066
I'll have more on the falling
temperatures later in the hour.

1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:55.033
Back to you, Scott.

1:15:55.166 --> 1:15:56.500
- The dance is on.
- Yay.

1:15:56.633 --> 1:15:57.467
This just in.

1:15:57.600 --> 1:15:58.467
A Marine Corps special
operations team

1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:01.767
has infiltrated an enemy
compound in Yemen.

1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:03.934
We are getting word
that several prisoners

1:16:04.066 --> 1:16:05.400
have been rescued
in the mission.

1:16:05.533 --> 1:16:06.867
We'll bring you
the latest details

1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:08.600
as they come into
the newsroom.

1:16:14.734 --> 1:16:15.734
Prisoners?

1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:19.033
Colby's plane crashed
off the Gulf of Aden.

1:16:19.166 --> 1:16:20.967
That's right next to Yemen.

1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:22.567
I wouldn't read
too much into it.

1:16:22.700 --> 1:16:24.667
I have to talk to
General Anderson.

1:16:26.900 --> 1:16:28.367
Sophia?

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:29.567
Hi.

1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:31.567
I need your help again.

1:16:39.100 --> 1:16:40.533
General Anderson, hi.

1:16:40.667 --> 1:16:42.100
Thank you so much
for calling me.

1:16:42.233 --> 1:16:45.100
Sophia tells me you have
questions about the mission.

1:16:45.233 --> 1:16:46.266
The one on the news?

1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:48.233
Yes.

1:16:48.367 --> 1:16:50.200
General, is it possible
that one of the prisoners

1:16:50.333 --> 1:16:52.133
they rescued knows
what happened to Colby?

1:16:52.266 --> 1:16:54.300
So, that we can recover
his body?

1:16:54.433 --> 1:16:56.200
Danielle...

1:16:56.333 --> 1:16:58.467
according to the intelligence
I've received,

1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:00.867
no US military members
were being held captive

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:02.133
at that compound.

1:17:02.266 --> 1:17:05.367
The prisoners
were all foreigners.

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:07.600
Is it possible someone
can talk to them?

1:17:07.734 --> 1:17:12.200
It's not how these things work,
it's just not that simple.

1:17:12.333 --> 1:17:15.834
Danielle, I'd love nothing more
than to bring you closure.

1:17:15.967 --> 1:17:17.633
I'm sorry.

1:17:17.934 --> 1:17:19.800
No, it's okay.

1:17:30.934 --> 1:17:32.533
I don't think I have ever seen

1:17:32.667 --> 1:17:35.734
a little lady look more
beautiful in my entire life.

1:17:35.867 --> 1:17:37.333
Thanks Mommy.

1:17:37.467 --> 1:17:39.333
Daddy would be so proud.

1:17:40.767 --> 1:17:41.500
You ready?

1:17:41.633 --> 1:17:43.000
Ready!

1:17:44.767 --> 1:17:45.633
Okay dads.

1:17:45.767 --> 1:17:46.934
I know we got some moms
in the house too.

1:17:47.066 --> 1:17:50.667
I hope you're ready to rock
until the break... of 8:00 PM.

1:18:00.233 --> 1:18:01.233
Go ahead.

1:18:01.367 --> 1:18:02.734
Are you sure, Mommy?

1:18:02.867 --> 1:18:05.133
Yeah honey, have fun.

1:18:30.700 --> 1:18:31.834
Okay ladies and gents.

1:18:31.967 --> 1:18:35.100

the father-daughter dance.
