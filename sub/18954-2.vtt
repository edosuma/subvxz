00:30.540 --> 00:35.210
'A world was moving from a
time of limits, of austerity,

00:35.260 --> 00:38.850
'into one which promised
endless reinvention.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.410
'We could change the homes we lived in,

00:41.460 --> 00:43.370
'and the clothes we wore.

00:43.420 --> 00:47.410
'We could fly across the
world, investigate new planets,

00:47.460 --> 00:50.940
'begin to crack our own genetic code.

00:52.340 --> 00:57.450
'But, no matter what science sought,
our challenge remained the same --

00:57.500 --> 01:00.890
'to accept what it meant to be human.

01:00.940 --> 01:05.019
'To embrace our strengths,
our weaknesses, our dreams.'

01:10.700 --> 01:12.580
Walk, don't run.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.300
Another letter from Hong Kong.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.610
Don't you think you should open it?

01:20.660 --> 01:23.890
And be late for clinic, incurring
the wrath of Sister Ursula?

01:23.940 --> 01:25.690
Have you lost your marbles, Busby?

01:25.740 --> 01:28.970
- Two minutes, Pats, to read the
letter. That's all. - In which time,

01:29.020 --> 01:31.580
I could have taken a patient's
temperature or blood pressure.

01:34.980 --> 01:36.810
I spoke with the Mother House.

01:36.860 --> 01:39.140
Sister Mary Cynthia recuperates well.

01:40.380 --> 01:44.530
Oh, I had planned to telephone myself.

01:44.580 --> 01:45.740
Now there's no need.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.490
Shall we make this the last?

01:48.540 --> 01:50.010
I beg your pardon?

01:50.060 --> 01:52.970
None of us can truly spare
the time for arranging them.

01:53.020 --> 01:54.260
Don't you agree?

02:06.980 --> 02:08.180
Sweeties!

02:18.780 --> 02:22.500
Pink ticket, number 16, please. Mrs Reed.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.140
We're coming, Nurse.

02:34.860 --> 02:37.930
You go on, love. You've got
work. I'll manage from here.

02:37.980 --> 02:39.620
She's in good hands, Mr Reed.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.220
Your pocket.

02:51.020 --> 02:54.770
Unlike your sisters, I won't indulge you.

02:54.820 --> 02:57.900
Bonbons. Now.

03:13.700 --> 03:17.090
We don't appear to have your full
notes. Where were you before?

03:17.140 --> 03:21.170
We were Whitechapel, Nurse.
Dr Treneman on Alderman Row.

03:21.220 --> 03:22.970
And this is your first pregnancy?

03:23.020 --> 03:24.820
It is. My only baby.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.740
Let's see how baby's getting
on. Cold hands, I'm afraid.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.250
That's all feeling jolly good.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.890
Now, let's have a listen to baby's
heartbeat. Then blood pressure,

03:38.940 --> 03:41.730
urine sample, and we'll
book you in for a home visit.

03:41.780 --> 03:45.770
Oh, I shan't be at home. I'm to go
to St Cuthbert's for my caesarean.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.650
We'll want to see you regularly now,

03:47.700 --> 03:50.210
and, well, it'll save you the journey.

03:50.260 --> 03:53.250
Never dared hope for such treatment.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.410
I think perhaps because I'm smaller,

03:56.460 --> 03:58.420
people think the hopes are not so great.

04:02.180 --> 04:05.610
That's it, you're getting it
now, just got to keep working it.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.610
Imagine you're in the
ring with Henry Cooper.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.610
I'm picturing the rent man, Mum.

04:09.660 --> 04:11.500
- Hello, love!
- George!

04:13.140 --> 04:14.770
I'll get flour all over you.

04:14.820 --> 04:18.209
Ah, that's no worse than what's been
on me today -- coal, grain and sugar.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.410
It's a good one today.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.610
Same tomorrow -- big
ships coming in all week.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.970
- Oh! - I did well with
this one, didn't I, Mum?

04:24.020 --> 04:25.770
You both done well.

04:25.820 --> 04:28.220
Come on then, Mister.
We're waiting for you.

04:32.420 --> 04:36.610
But pregnancy for a woman with
achondroplasia is quite risky.

04:36.660 --> 04:38.890
How can Mrs Reed not be aware of that?

04:38.940 --> 04:40.130
I don't know, Doctor.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.210
But she's definitely been booked
in for a caesarean so, well, someone

04:43.260 --> 04:45.770
must have discussed the potential
problems of a vaginal birth.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.850
The size of the pelvis is an obvious one,

04:47.900 --> 04:51.330
- but there are others, and she should
be aware of them. - It's normally

04:51.380 --> 04:55.130
wonderful seeing a mother
brimming over with excitement.

04:55.180 --> 04:57.450
In this case, it unsettles me.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.770
Let me do a bit of digging.

04:59.820 --> 05:02.930
Once we've seen the notes,
we'll know what she knows,

05:02.980 --> 05:05.450
and then we can work out
the best way to help.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.780
All right.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.100
How's your father?

05:15.460 --> 05:16.810
Pats, what did the letter say?

05:16.860 --> 05:18.330
I haven't had the chance to read it.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.500
- Then read it now.
- I'm trying to sleep.

05:22.300 --> 05:25.850
Besides, if I ignore it,
then it might all go away.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.690
Why do you always make
light of everything?

05:28.740 --> 05:32.500
I know what the letter
will say -- "Come home."

05:34.700 --> 05:36.660
And that will mean leaving you.

05:37.740 --> 05:39.780
So, I'd prefer to leave it unread.

05:46.340 --> 05:49.490
Mrs Reed's notes from
Dr Treneman's surgery.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.170
Thank you.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.210
You look a bit better, Shelagh.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.970
With luck, it will pass
in a couple of weeks.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.450
A year ago, I would have
offered you Distaval.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.890
A year ago, I would
probably have taken it.

06:01.940 --> 06:05.290
When I think about those poor
babies born without arms or legs,

06:05.340 --> 06:06.810
because of thalidomide...

06:06.860 --> 06:08.500
I think about them every day.

06:09.860 --> 06:14.820
But I think about this too,
and how miraculous it is.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.180
How lucky we are.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.970
We ought to start telling people, really.

06:25.020 --> 06:27.770
I'd want the children to know first.

06:27.820 --> 06:31.810
Angela's too little to understand,
but Timothy's a teenage boy.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.690
He'll certainly understand!

06:33.740 --> 06:35.490
Oh, Patrick!

06:43.940 --> 06:46.020
Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.540
Sister Winifred -- Mrs Marsh is in labour.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.210
I can't say this situation
doesn't worry me.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.370
And both parents are dwarves, so
there's a high chance this baby will

07:12.420 --> 07:14.170
be born with the same condition.

07:14.220 --> 07:16.210
It could still be healthy.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.850
- And it would be so loved.
- I know.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.690
And if the genetics work out differently,

07:20.740 --> 07:22.850
it could actually be of normal size.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.770
- Really?
- Well, it's possible.

07:24.820 --> 07:28.130
But it's also possible the
baby will be stillborn,

07:28.180 --> 07:29.660
or only live for hours.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.130
And we have no way of knowing
which way the dice will fall.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.250
In which case, we must prepare
Mrs Reed for every scenario.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.690
Even the saddest.

07:38.740 --> 07:40.810
I'll do that.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.900
I have to.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.890
But she's so happy!

07:44.940 --> 07:47.290
The thought of anything going
wrong will break her heart.

07:47.340 --> 07:48.850
She already knows.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.370
Her previous GP told her.

07:51.420 --> 07:54.700
He also told her that she
should terminate the pregnancy.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.770
Here, Val! They're saying it's
going to be today. The baby.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.570
Make sure you pop by later, there'll
be a drink on the bar for you.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.140
All the luck to you, George.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.450
Oh, Jessie, you're nearly there.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.930
OK, Jessie.

08:18.980 --> 08:23.570
Let's just take some slow breaths.
Slow your breathing right down.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.410
We're very close now.

08:25.460 --> 08:29.380
Now, just one very gentle push,
and we should see baby's head.

08:31.700 --> 08:35.580
Perfect, absolutely
perfect. And pant for me.

08:37.860 --> 08:40.770
That's it, that's it.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.289
Now another push for the shoulders.

08:43.340 --> 08:47.090
I know you're exhausted, but I
know you have the strength, Jessie.

08:47.140 --> 08:49.540
Dig deep for it now and push for baby.

08:52.140 --> 08:56.250
Well done! Well done! Baby's coming!

08:56.300 --> 08:57.940
Ah, hear that, Jessie?

09:00.660 --> 09:02.450
It's a little boy, Jessie.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.460
Hello, my little one.

09:29.580 --> 09:33.020
George and me agreed Bobby
for a boy, after Dad.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.650
George Marsh?

09:53.700 --> 09:56.010
Are you ready for your
smallpox vaccination?

09:56.060 --> 09:57.690
Here, ain't you got something smaller?

09:57.740 --> 09:59.850
Oh, George, don't be a baby.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.330
Talking of which -- I
hear your wife's in labour.

10:02.380 --> 10:04.530
Ow! Here, that was crafty.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.180
It's called distraction.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.900
Off you go. And good
luck to you and Jessie.

10:11.180 --> 10:13.370
Arthur Pilbury?

10:13.420 --> 10:14.970
Hello.

10:15.020 --> 10:17.780
If you'd roll your sleeve
up and relax your arm.

10:22.420 --> 10:26.060
Mrs Reed, we have your
notes from Dr Treneman.

10:35.180 --> 10:39.130
We know you understand the risks
associated with your pregnancy.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.570
All I want is to be able to
help with what may lie ahead.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.970
I wanted this baby for so long.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.490
No-one ever thought I'd be
able to fall, never mind carry.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.500
They were wrong, Nurse. Why
can't they be wrong now?

10:52.620 --> 10:54.860
I so very, very much hope that they are.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.450
But I have a duty to care
for you as much as for baby,

10:58.500 --> 11:01.540
and part of that's trying to prepare you.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.690
I can feel my baby.

11:05.740 --> 11:08.810
He kicks and wriggles when we sing to him.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.740
He's my little miracle, Nurse.

11:12.020 --> 11:14.970
Don't ask me to give up, because I won't.

11:15.020 --> 11:16.340
I can't.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.620
Here, I got it, Arthur. You rest now.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.860
I don't have the lungs
for this game no more.

11:58.060 --> 11:59.900
Oh!

12:18.780 --> 12:22.330
Telephone for an ambulance
and the fire brigade. Hurry!

12:22.380 --> 12:24.770
Nurse, over here. Nurse, help this man.

12:24.820 --> 12:27.050
Fetch fresh water and blankets.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.930
We've only got the piped
river water, Nurse.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.050
I need clean water.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.730
Go to the pub, fetch
water. Fill the kegs. Hurry.

12:34.780 --> 12:37.090
Well, don't just stand
there -- go with him.

12:37.140 --> 12:40.650
Valerie Dyer. I'm a nurse.
Queen Alexandra's. Army Corps.

12:40.700 --> 12:41.690
Tell me what you need.

12:41.740 --> 12:43.810
We need to get these men
away from the building

12:43.860 --> 12:46.210
and check them for smoke damage and burns.

12:46.260 --> 12:49.060
I need everyone away from the building!

12:53.980 --> 12:59.170
All right, now, deep breaths, nice
and easy. Let's get you sat down.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.130
Come and sit down.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.370
Pump. Get the water in there now.

13:03.420 --> 13:06.220
Through the grates, through
the doors, flood it.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.650
Can't breathe.

13:10.700 --> 13:15.570
It's the smoke. Try not to
panic. Slow, deep breaths.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.890
Arthur Pilbury and George Marsh
-- they're still in there.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.970
Oh, Lord, no.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.090
I'm coming with you.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.770
Look, the fire's only just out.

13:22.820 --> 13:25.370
The bloody wiring must've caused
this. It'll still be dangerous.

13:25.420 --> 13:26.650
I'm coming with you.

13:26.700 --> 13:27.740
So am I.

13:29.340 --> 13:30.810
Here!

13:30.860 --> 13:32.410
There!

13:32.460 --> 13:34.860
HELP! HELP!

13:36.460 --> 13:39.530
It's all right, George. We're here now.

13:39.580 --> 13:42.650
It's Mrs Turner. I'm here with Miss Dyer.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.050
You know me, George, Val from the pub.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.730
Val. Val, what's happened to me?

13:47.780 --> 13:51.020
Let him go now, George.
Let me try to help Arthur.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.490
Arthur? Arthur, can you hear me?

13:56.540 --> 13:59.730
All right there, George. We'll
get you out as soon as we can.

13:59.780 --> 14:03.490
Me eyes. Me eyes, w...
what's wrong with them?

14:03.540 --> 14:05.650
Don't touch them, George.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.050
- You got fresh water?
- There's none down here.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.610
Help me, I... I can't see.

14:09.660 --> 14:12.210
This man needs clean
water, and he needs it now.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.530
It's just a warehouse. We're not equipped.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.780
Here's a Thermos. There's water in it.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.020
Come on, Arthur, breathe.

14:30.140 --> 14:31.610
Lean back, I've got you.

14:31.660 --> 14:35.650
- I got you! - Breathe, Arthur,
breathe. - Lean back into me.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.860
That's it.

14:44.260 --> 14:46.660
- All right.
- Come on, Arthur.

14:47.740 --> 14:50.610
I can't see. I can't see nothing.

14:50.660 --> 14:53.210
- You're going to be fine, George.
- W... why can't I see?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.610
The doctor will be here soon.

14:55.660 --> 14:59.250
Here! Your Jessie might
have had her baby by now.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.050
We've got a book running
at the Black Sail --

15:01.100 --> 15:02.570
we all reckon it's going to be a girl.

15:02.620 --> 15:04.420
- Do you?
- Yeah, most definitely.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.490
Or a boy.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.930
Each way, then!

15:08.980 --> 15:11.330
Each way. That's the stuff.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.090
Arthur, come on, breathe.

15:13.140 --> 15:14.180
Don't leave me.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.260
Leave my best customer?

15:19.620 --> 15:22.130
I'm right here, George.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.380
I'm right here.

15:44.660 --> 15:46.930
This isn't too deep.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.930
But you must have been in
shock, if you didn't feel it.

15:49.980 --> 15:53.490
All I could think of was
trying to help those men.

15:53.540 --> 15:56.330
There was nothing of any use at all there!

15:56.380 --> 15:58.610
No first aid-box, no water, nothing.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.940
At least there was us. And our training.

16:03.140 --> 16:06.090
Wait till I tell my mum I've been in here!

16:06.140 --> 16:09.090
When I was little, me and my
sisters used to watch the Nonnatuns

16:09.140 --> 16:11.450
arriving on their bikes with
the big black bags on the back.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.250
And then we'd hear that Mrs
Mahoney, or Mrs Blewitt,

16:14.300 --> 16:17.170
or Cousin Peg had had
a little boy or girl.

16:17.220 --> 16:20.260
We thought you brought
the baby in the bag!

16:22.340 --> 16:25.850
Yes, they keep them in
that cupboard over there.

16:25.900 --> 16:29.250
Where have you been nursing since
you left the Army, Miss Dyer?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.010
I haven't.

16:31.060 --> 16:32.530
I wanted to come home,

16:32.580 --> 16:36.850
and home's quite a nice place to
be while I decide what's next.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.450
I'm not that good at sitting
with my feet up, though.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.530
That's how I came to be pulling
pints in my auntie's pub today.

16:42.580 --> 16:45.210
It's extremely fortunate that you were.

16:45.260 --> 16:46.500
It was awful.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.890
You think you'd get used
to the sound of men yelling,

16:49.940 --> 16:51.980
but you never do.

17:00.940 --> 17:02.580
I'm so sorry, Mrs Marsh.

17:03.980 --> 17:05.810
His sight, it...

17:05.859 --> 17:07.660
It will come back, won't it?

17:09.060 --> 17:12.569
George has deep burns to his eyes.

17:15.420 --> 17:17.140
I fell in love with those eyes.

17:18.780 --> 17:21.130
It's too much for her, Dr Turner.

17:21.180 --> 17:23.290
You know, she's only just had the baby.

17:23.339 --> 17:25.369
Can you give her something to help her?

17:25.420 --> 17:27.010
Mum, no, I don't want to take nothing.

17:27.060 --> 17:29.090
I just want to know -- will he see again?

17:29.140 --> 17:30.820
We have to be very patient.

17:32.060 --> 17:36.500
We have to wait for the swelling to
come down, and then we'll know more.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.500
He's been living for Bobby.

17:43.660 --> 17:47.780
You'll pull him through, won't
you? He's got to see you.

17:49.460 --> 17:50.620
He's got to.

17:57.060 --> 18:02.010
.. bless, O Father, thy gifts to our use,

18:02.060 --> 18:05.930
and us to thy service,

18:05.980 --> 18:09.330
for Christ's sake. Amen.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.890
Amen.

18:10.940 --> 18:14.700
It has been a turbulent day.
Let us restore ourselves.

18:16.660 --> 18:20.370
I had meant to broach
this at a later date,

18:20.420 --> 18:23.660
but it appears an opportune
moment to do so now.

18:25.260 --> 18:28.650
During my time here, I have been
struck by the lengths you go to

18:28.700 --> 18:31.380
for your patients, above and beyond.

18:32.700 --> 18:35.690
No request is too great a trouble.

18:35.740 --> 18:39.300
You are ceaseless in your
well-meaning involvement.

18:41.020 --> 18:45.570
But you are encouraging dependencies
which cannot be supported.

18:45.620 --> 18:48.450
We have more patients and less
staff, and we must see ourselves

18:48.500 --> 18:50.940
as resources to be used sparingly.

18:52.820 --> 18:57.020
You are midwives and nurses,
not maids and nannies.

19:00.060 --> 19:02.570
We are whatever is needed.

19:02.620 --> 19:05.890
But don't you see? You will
now be what is needed most --

19:05.940 --> 19:09.660
providers of efficient health
care and midwifery services.

19:10.700 --> 19:14.420
"Now I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

19:15.860 --> 19:17.970
Just as our approach must change,

19:18.020 --> 19:21.570
so must our way of
organising Nonnatus House.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.650
There is to be no fat on the lamb.

19:24.700 --> 19:29.330
We are to become a hub
of energy and activity,

19:29.380 --> 19:32.060
fit for the challenges
of the modern world.

19:33.100 --> 19:37.050
Those who do not earn their
place must find another,

19:37.100 --> 19:39.700
or there will be
professional consequences.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.530
And Nurse Gilbert, second call.

19:45.580 --> 19:48.530
Up and at 'em, ladies. We've
a full day ahead of us.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.930
I would like to take Mrs
Marsh to see her husband,

19:50.980 --> 19:54.730
if he's up to visitors, but it would
mean my swapping with Mrs Henderson.

19:54.780 --> 19:57.490
That's fine. I can take
care of Mrs Henderson.

19:57.540 --> 20:00.730
It's been made more than clear
that we should provide only care

20:00.780 --> 20:05.570
that is strictly necessary, and
then within an appointment.

20:05.620 --> 20:09.210
I'm afraid your request strays
into the land of extra-curricular.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.850
And travel visas there
have been cancelled.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.690
Mr Marsh has been through
a terrible trauma.

20:14.740 --> 20:17.850
I'm quite sure that a visit from
his wife is exactly what's needed,

20:17.900 --> 20:20.500
to lift his spirits with news of his son.

20:21.620 --> 20:25.260
We can still maintain compassion,
even with efficiency.

20:26.940 --> 20:29.730
I'm not sure I heard you
correctly, Sister Winifred.

20:29.780 --> 20:31.580
I'm a trifle deaf these days.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.140
Midwife calling.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.450
Mrs Reed. How are we today?

20:45.500 --> 20:48.970
Oh, you know, still breathless,
and I feel ever so big now.

20:49.020 --> 20:53.610
I'll make us coffee, and while I do,
I'd like you to look through these.

20:53.660 --> 20:57.340
A little light reading. We recommend
it for all our mothers-to-be.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.010
But...

21:02.060 --> 21:05.300
Nurse Mount, you made it
sound as if I shouldn't hope.

21:07.180 --> 21:09.530
We can offer no promises,

21:09.580 --> 21:12.050
nothing to outweigh those
with greater knowledge,

21:12.100 --> 21:15.090
but at this moment, you
are an expectant mother.

21:15.140 --> 21:19.220
I think in all my talk of duty,
perhaps I forgot to speak of joy.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.970
I keep thinking how much
worse this could have been.

21:30.020 --> 21:33.730
You're such a catastrophist!
But you're also a doctor,

21:33.780 --> 21:37.290
and you know what it's like when
help is needed -- you just jump in.

21:37.340 --> 21:39.690
He would have got even more
involved than you, Mum!

21:39.740 --> 21:42.130
Probably ended up fried to a crisp.

21:42.180 --> 21:43.420
Patrick?

21:45.140 --> 21:46.370
Now?

21:46.420 --> 21:49.250
Best done when we're all
together as a family.

21:49.300 --> 21:52.250
Mum, the fact that your
biscuit intake has rocketed,

21:52.300 --> 21:54.890
you turn green at the mention
of sardines, and Dad won't even

21:54.940 --> 21:58.410
let you pick up a teapot, leads
me to only one conclusion,

21:58.460 --> 22:01.730
as does the embarrassed
looks on your faces.

22:01.780 --> 22:05.380
Angela and I are getting a baby
sister or brother, aren't we?

22:07.820 --> 22:09.130
Yes.

22:09.180 --> 22:10.570
Yes, we are.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.340
Good. And I don't want
to know any other details.

22:24.820 --> 22:26.820
- Mr Marsh, please.
- He's just over there.

22:31.620 --> 22:33.170
George!

22:33.220 --> 22:34.290
Jessie?

22:34.340 --> 22:36.620
I'm here. I'm here, love. I'm here.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.020
We got a son.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.490
Bobby.

22:44.540 --> 22:46.530
He's the spit of you already.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.210
He's so beautiful.

22:48.260 --> 22:49.770
Look, talk to the doctors, will you?

22:49.820 --> 22:51.530
Cos the nurses ain't
making no sense to me.

22:51.580 --> 22:54.860
They're saying they don't know
if me sight will come back.

22:56.780 --> 23:00.770
Mr Marsh, I'm Sister
Winifred from Nonnatus House.

23:00.820 --> 23:03.850
I had the honour of delivering
your beautiful little boy.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.690
Well, when am I going to see again?

23:05.740 --> 23:08.210
The doctors have said that once
the swelling has gone down,

23:08.260 --> 23:10.130
they'll be in a better
position to understand.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.410
That's not telling me nothing.
Am I going to be blind?

23:13.460 --> 23:16.170
Your eyes must be given
the chance to heal.

23:16.220 --> 23:20.090
George, we got a baby
boy. Just think of him.

23:20.140 --> 23:22.340
Without me sight, I've got nothing.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.010
Still can't get your plaster wet, Mum?

23:31.060 --> 23:33.770
I believe the authorities look
unfavourably on child labour.

23:33.820 --> 23:36.650
Oh, didn't I say? I'm a slow healer.

23:36.700 --> 23:40.010
I've been thinking -- if the baby's
another girl, I might move out.

23:40.060 --> 23:43.810
I might come with you. If I
stay, I'll be outnumbered.

23:43.860 --> 23:46.130
It's from the Coroner's Court.

23:46.180 --> 23:48.690
There's to be an inquest into
the death of Arthur Pilbury.

23:48.740 --> 23:50.540
They want me to act as a witness.

23:54.740 --> 23:57.290
I'm glad they're investigating.

23:57.340 --> 24:00.060
Always good to make these
things a matter of record.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.490
There's no need be nervous, Shelagh.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.570
I suppose not.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.930
Perhaps I can make the coroner see
what should be done for the future.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.140
That's my girl.

24:16.260 --> 24:19.210
They want George to speak
up at court for Arthur.

24:19.260 --> 24:21.970
Oh, well, that could spur
him on, don't you think?

24:22.020 --> 24:23.530
I can't say, Mum.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.570
They was always close, him and Arthur.

24:25.620 --> 24:26.700
He gets so tired.

24:27.940 --> 24:29.900
We're still early days, ain't we?

24:31.940 --> 24:34.930
I wish I could bring something in for you.

24:34.980 --> 24:36.410
I feel I'm just making it harder.

24:36.460 --> 24:40.220
None of that talk now. We
couldn't manage without you.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.900
We'll just have to bake more bread.

24:45.020 --> 24:47.730
George will be back on his
feet, and it'll be like normal.

24:47.780 --> 24:49.620
Only better, cos we've
got this little one.

24:57.180 --> 25:00.650
It's like a jumping bean. I
call it the morning shuffle.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.450
Now, you're sure you're managing?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.610
Your lungs are probably
quite restricted by now.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.730
- I'm breathless all right.
- We can ask for a home help.

25:06.780 --> 25:10.010
No, I've got Derek.
He's a whizz in a pinny.

25:10.060 --> 25:12.130
Well, don't be brave and struggle on.

25:12.180 --> 25:15.060
It's no struggle, Nurse.
Not this little miracle.

25:16.260 --> 25:17.570
How's our patient?

25:17.620 --> 25:19.620
Your wife is a model mother-to-be.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.620
Would you like to hear baby?

25:59.460 --> 26:01.140
Sorry, do excuse me.

26:16.740 --> 26:21.290
My word -- back up to your
birth weight in just a week.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.620
Bravo, little one.

26:27.780 --> 26:30.940
There's still no change, with George?

26:33.580 --> 26:35.490
He says it's like being buried alive.

26:35.540 --> 26:38.290
You mustn't give up.

26:38.340 --> 26:40.170
It's not me who's given up.

26:40.220 --> 26:45.020
This is the dark before the
dawn, but there is always a dawn.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.490
I think someone might have been
listening to me "upstairs."

26:52.540 --> 26:53.850
Shall I top up the meter?

26:53.900 --> 26:55.930
No. We can manage.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.170
Jessie?

26:57.220 --> 27:00.740
We're just a bit short, that's
all, without George's wage.

27:06.700 --> 27:09.460
One wonders what is left to clean.

27:10.780 --> 27:12.450
You startled me.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.450
Indeed.

27:14.500 --> 27:18.660
For you are close to what
magicians call a hypnotic state.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.660
It really is just cleaning.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.450
Sister Monica Joan, is there
something I can help you with?

27:30.500 --> 27:33.370
I've committed a crime
-- I read your letter.

27:33.420 --> 27:36.570
There comes a time when even the songbird

27:36.620 --> 27:41.650
must return to its nest to
hear the tune its parents sang.

27:41.700 --> 27:42.740
He's dying.

27:44.700 --> 27:46.290
I can't make him better.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.260
You can ease him on his way.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.180
I'm good at my job.

27:56.860 --> 27:58.260
Very good at it.

27:59.820 --> 28:02.250
I know how to look after my patients.

28:02.300 --> 28:05.020
All of this -- Nonnatus, Poplar.

28:06.540 --> 28:08.060
Terribly good at all of it.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.700
But losing someone?

28:12.260 --> 28:13.340
Nope.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.210
Not good at that at all.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.180
We only fail when we do not try.

28:29.740 --> 28:32.090
Now, are you sure you don't
want me to wait with you?

28:32.140 --> 28:36.740
Derek, I'll be fine. Go!
Finish adapting the pram.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.660
Sorry, after you.

28:55.780 --> 28:59.620
Here we are, Mr Marsh -- what
a lovely welcome party for you.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.220
Hello, George, love.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.010
Jess.

29:06.060 --> 29:10.620
There's someone else here for
you, George. Bobby's here.

29:12.780 --> 29:13.980
This is your daddy.

29:14.980 --> 29:16.410
No. No, not like this.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.210
He shouldn't be in a place like this.

29:18.260 --> 29:19.450
Get him out of here!

29:19.500 --> 29:21.250
What, you want to torture
me a bit more, do you?

29:21.300 --> 29:23.970
I brought him cos he's your son,
and I thought he'd give you hope.

29:24.020 --> 29:27.700
I can't see him, Jess!
He's a stranger to me.

29:29.580 --> 29:32.570
You think that's how I
want him to know me?

29:32.620 --> 29:35.610
I won't be a father like
this, Jessie. Not like this.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.580
And I want to be a mother like this?

29:38.820 --> 29:42.650
On my own, unable to sleep
at night for worrying

29:42.700 --> 29:45.730
if you're suffering, if you're frightened.

29:45.780 --> 29:47.130
I don't want it this way,

29:47.180 --> 29:49.810
but my God, I'll make the
best of it if I have to.

29:49.860 --> 29:53.820
Cos you're alive, and I'll
take you deaf, broke, or blind.

29:57.660 --> 30:01.860
You know how much this meant to
me today, bringing Bobby to you?

30:05.140 --> 30:06.340
Bye, love.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.740
Don't you know me yet?

30:14.020 --> 30:15.700
I love the bones of you.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.580
The very heart of you, George.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.500
As I was saying, ladies...

30:43.060 --> 30:44.250
Ladies?

30:45.740 --> 30:48.330
If we might continue.

30:48.380 --> 30:51.090
For nearly nine months,
you've each been providing

30:51.140 --> 30:53.050
full bed and board for baby.

30:53.100 --> 30:56.210
Excuse me, Nurse Gilbert, might I be
excused to the little girls' room?

30:56.260 --> 30:58.380
Oh, of course.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.410
As I was saying, birth is a little
like bank holiday weather --

31:03.460 --> 31:05.780
you're never quite sure what you'll get.

31:14.820 --> 31:17.980
Sister? Are you going on a picnic?

31:19.940 --> 31:23.570
I'm not saying I wouldn't be
tempted by a jam sandwich,

31:23.620 --> 31:25.410
or a pickled onion one,

31:25.460 --> 31:29.860
but Mrs Marsh is struggling
without her husband's wage.

31:31.380 --> 31:32.540
This is for her.

31:36.620 --> 31:40.930
There's a packet of Rich Tea
on the lower shelf, tucked away.

31:40.980 --> 31:44.770
Biscuits are always welcome in a
crisis -- people drink so much tea.

31:44.820 --> 31:48.460
Sisters. We must husband
our resources carefully.

31:49.580 --> 31:52.730
Who is to say that greater
troubles will not come tomorrow?

31:52.780 --> 31:56.730
Sister Ursula, we have always
helped our neighbours where we can.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.810
And the people in this
district ARE our neighbours,

31:58.860 --> 32:01.180
not objects of charity or pity.

32:02.660 --> 32:07.490
They are the first to give
to us when they have flowers,

32:07.540 --> 32:10.170
or fruit, or vegetables to spare.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.250
Be that as it may,

32:11.300 --> 32:16.330
we cannot create the expectation
of personal support at every turn.

32:16.380 --> 32:19.650
We are here to nurse our
patients, not to nanny them.

32:19.700 --> 32:20.730
Yes, Sister.

32:20.780 --> 32:23.580
I do not wish to be forced
to discipline anyone...

32:24.980 --> 32:28.370
.. and I'm sure Sister Winifred
will not waste her time again

32:28.420 --> 32:31.620
by accompanying patients
on visits to the hospital.

32:34.180 --> 32:36.970
Jessie Marsh has just had a baby.

32:37.020 --> 32:41.050
Her mother has arthritis. There was
no-one else who could take her.

32:41.100 --> 32:45.010
This is a close-knit community.
Somebody else could have been found,

32:45.060 --> 32:47.660
and you could have
continued with your duties.

32:52.780 --> 32:56.940
No matter what she says, this
isn't the way we do things.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.460
No, it is not.

33:08.460 --> 33:14.050
Hello, Fred. Have you any spare
carrots or maybe some potatoes?

33:14.100 --> 33:17.570
That's a very personal question, but, yes.

33:17.620 --> 33:21.380
We're collecting for a
patient. Discreetly collecting.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.340
You look fatigued.

33:28.820 --> 33:30.730
I rather needed some air.

33:30.780 --> 33:33.450
This is the Anschluss of Nonnatus,

33:33.500 --> 33:37.740
and we must simply sit it
out and wait for Churchill.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.290
Now, of course, at the hospital,

33:43.340 --> 33:46.610
Nurse will provide you
with sanitary napkins,

33:46.660 --> 33:49.530
breastpads, and clothes for baby.

33:49.580 --> 33:51.730
He's got nothing to be showing off for.

33:55.380 --> 33:59.530
But your case must contain all
that you will need for lying in.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.370
And of course, not only
your outfit for coming home,

34:02.420 --> 34:04.820
but also baby's travelling outfit.

34:06.780 --> 34:10.330
Do we have any seamstresses
or tailors in our ranks today?

34:10.380 --> 34:13.889
I'm a seamstress. I make all
my clothes, and my husband's.

34:13.940 --> 34:16.170
Well, I'm no expert in
the world of couture,

34:16.219 --> 34:18.610
seeing as I wear my uniform most days,

34:18.659 --> 34:21.889
but am I right that the
correct outfit is as important

34:21.940 --> 34:24.170
as the event one is wearing it to?

34:24.219 --> 34:25.929
I should say so.

34:25.980 --> 34:29.170
Well, there you have
it, from one who knows.

34:29.219 --> 34:30.889
Did you make your dress?

34:30.940 --> 34:32.770
Oh, I'd love to have
something in that colour,

34:32.820 --> 34:34.570
after the baby, of course.

34:34.620 --> 34:36.010
Are you on the telephone?

34:36.060 --> 34:37.940
I am. Poplar 232.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.050
What's all this?

34:47.100 --> 34:48.889
We had a little extra in our harvest,

34:48.940 --> 34:51.370
and none of us could
bear it going to waste.

34:51.420 --> 34:52.650
We don't need charity.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.330
We do, love.

34:54.380 --> 34:57.060
It's not forever, and
there's no shame in it.

35:01.620 --> 35:03.340
Just to tide us over, then.

35:08.300 --> 35:11.010
They were such a lovely bunch, Derek.

35:11.060 --> 35:14.980
I'd so love to have them here one
day -- perhaps for a coffee morning.

35:16.540 --> 35:19.050
Probably wouldn't want
to come, would they?

35:19.100 --> 35:21.370
It would be a trek for them.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.290
You're not finishing the pram first?

35:23.340 --> 35:26.220
The pram doesn't earn me
money. Repairing the clock does.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.810
Derek, we need the pram ready.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.060
No, we don't!

35:32.580 --> 35:35.170
We're in cloud-cuckoo-land.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.370
I'm scared if you go into that
hospital, then you won't come out.

35:38.420 --> 35:39.620
Neither of you.

35:45.300 --> 35:49.330
Shelagh, don't make yourself
ill with anxiety about this.

35:49.380 --> 35:52.450
I'm just afraid I won't
remember everything.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.970
Things moved so fast during the accident.

35:55.020 --> 35:58.460
Your nerve didn't fail you then,
and it won't fail you today.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.380
Hold the line, Mrs Reed.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.730
Yes, I've got your details here.

36:24.780 --> 36:28.010
I will telephone the hospital and
an ambulance will collect you,

36:28.060 --> 36:30.460
and your surgery will be brought forward.

36:31.780 --> 36:35.020
Stay perfectly calm. There's
nothing to be upset about.

36:41.340 --> 36:43.770
Hello, Mrs Turner. You look nice.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.610
Oh, thank you.

36:45.660 --> 36:47.180
Nervous, but nice.

36:49.100 --> 36:52.050
I didn't know what to wear. I only
ever gave evidence once before,

36:52.100 --> 36:54.980
but it was an Army inquiry,
so I just wore a uniform.

37:01.100 --> 37:03.610
I'm glad I had shoes and
a blouse to fuss about.

37:03.660 --> 37:06.730
It took my mind off things -- all
the questions they might ask,

37:06.780 --> 37:08.250
and all the answers I wanted to give

37:08.300 --> 37:10.330
were going round and round inside my head.

37:10.380 --> 37:11.610
Mine too.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.810
You just want to get it right, don't you?

37:13.860 --> 37:15.970
For the sake of the victims.

37:16.020 --> 37:17.090
Yes.

37:17.140 --> 37:20.090
George Marsh and Arthur
Pilbury deserve better.

37:20.140 --> 37:23.890
They weren't soldiers going into
battle -- they were men doing a job.

37:23.940 --> 37:25.340
And it could've been avoided.

37:26.740 --> 37:28.380
Mrs Shelagh Turner.

37:30.140 --> 37:33.100
Your turn. Do your best for them.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.970
Mrs Berry -- a boy!

37:42.020 --> 37:45.530
Oh, thank the Lord, she
was two weeks overdue.

37:45.580 --> 37:49.170
And Mrs Reed -- oh,
poor thing, early labour.

37:49.220 --> 37:51.170
I'm sorry, did you say Mrs Reed?

37:51.220 --> 37:53.490
It seems her surgery's
been brought forward.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.130
I'll go to her at once.

37:55.180 --> 37:56.250
Nurse Mount...

37:56.300 --> 37:57.970
I'm not letting her go through this alone.

37:58.020 --> 38:01.010
Sister Ursula has been perfectly
clear -- there will be consequences.

38:01.060 --> 38:04.610
Consequences be damned.
Mrs Reed is my patient.

38:04.660 --> 38:08.250
If I've learned one thing
from Nonnatus, from you,

38:08.300 --> 38:10.860
it's that we do what's
right for our patient.

38:13.780 --> 38:15.140
Good on her.

38:20.540 --> 38:23.490
This woman is a primigravida
with achondroplasia.

38:23.540 --> 38:26.290
Her pelvic abnormalities
bar a vaginal delivery,

38:26.340 --> 38:28.770
thus a caesarean section is necessary.

38:28.820 --> 38:31.210
Labour has begun at 37 weeks,

38:31.260 --> 38:34.650
therefore we must proceed
immediately and get her to theatre.

38:34.700 --> 38:35.740
Bring her in.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.610
I'm sorry about that, Mrs Reed.

38:39.660 --> 38:41.490
I'll be with you in the operating theatre.

38:41.540 --> 38:42.730
Mrs Reed?

38:42.780 --> 38:44.100
You only have a moment.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.410
I don't want to lose my baby.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.690
Everyone will do all they
can for you and baby.

38:49.740 --> 38:52.730
I haven't got my case
-- it was all so quick.

38:52.780 --> 38:55.810
The midwife said they'd telephone
Derek, but he isn't here.

38:55.860 --> 38:57.180
Leave it all with me.

38:59.220 --> 39:02.860
Mr Marsh, unable to see,
was in great distress.

39:04.060 --> 39:07.050
All the while, I attempted
to revive Mr Pilbury,

39:07.100 --> 39:10.540
though very sadly it was too late
by the time we got to the men.

39:11.820 --> 39:13.810
I'm so sorry, Mrs Pilbury.

39:13.860 --> 39:17.410
You are here to address me,
Mrs Turner, nobody else.

39:17.460 --> 39:20.530
Thank you. We're
appreciative of your time.

39:20.580 --> 39:22.780
Sir, if I might be permitted.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.770
What we found at the dock was

39:25.820 --> 39:29.210
a dreadful lack of anything
that could have helped.

39:29.260 --> 39:31.890
Not even the basics of fresh running water

39:31.940 --> 39:33.690
for burns, or wound cleaning.

39:33.740 --> 39:34.890
Thank you, Mrs Turner.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.170
Had there been a register,
we would have known where

39:37.220 --> 39:41.170
Arthur Pilbury was. Perhaps he
could have been helped sooner.

39:41.220 --> 39:44.260
We are concerned only with
the cause of the accident.

39:46.340 --> 39:49.850
Should you not be concerned with
those living with its impact?

39:49.900 --> 39:51.300
You are free to leave.

40:03.580 --> 40:04.940
Where is Nurse Mount?

40:07.460 --> 40:08.660
Where she is needed.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.370
I told you not to make yourself ill.

40:23.420 --> 40:27.130
I'm not ill! I'm just tired.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.010
And angry.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.220
Still?

40:31.380 --> 40:33.660
I did my best. I know that.

40:34.740 --> 40:36.300
And so did Valerie Dyer.

40:38.140 --> 40:42.140
But our best is worthless,
because it won't change anything.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.410
Jessie?

40:55.460 --> 40:58.340
How are you, my love? Oh,
it's good to see you.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.290
Mr Reed? I'm Reverend Hereward.

41:11.340 --> 41:14.650
Nurse Mount thought you might
like some company while you wait.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.100
Will you bless our baby?

41:17.220 --> 41:19.810
Every doctor makes it
sound so... inevitable.

41:19.860 --> 41:24.450
Well, I'll do whatever you
need me to do, Mr Reed, but

41:24.500 --> 41:28.820
I've always found that by trusting
in God, nothing is inevitable.

42:03.140 --> 42:05.700
Feels like I can smell each tea leaf.

42:12.140 --> 42:14.410
It was good of you to come, Mrs Turner.

42:14.460 --> 42:17.050
I never thanked you, for what you
did for me and Arthur that day.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.330
You don't need to thank me.

42:19.380 --> 42:22.930
They don't know yet, about me
eyes, when the dressings come off,

42:22.980 --> 42:25.090
but they say without the
water you had on you,

42:25.140 --> 42:28.090
well, it gives me a chance
I wouldn't have had.

42:28.140 --> 42:29.180
Then help me.

42:30.780 --> 42:32.420
Come to the Coroner's Court.

42:33.460 --> 42:36.690
Tell them that men like
you should be protected.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.770
Stand up like this?

42:38.820 --> 42:40.940
No. Never.

42:42.020 --> 42:46.220
Tell them what this accident
has done to you, to Arthur.

42:48.340 --> 42:51.980
We tried, and couldn't save him,
but now we need to fight for him.

42:56.260 --> 42:58.610
I must know -- is baby all right?

42:58.660 --> 43:02.140
I don't know, Pats. The
paediatrician took it straight away.

43:04.660 --> 43:05.810
Sir?

43:05.860 --> 43:09.170
Do excuse me, I'm Nurse Mount,
Mrs Reed's district midwife.

43:09.220 --> 43:12.100
I ask that I be allowed to
break the news to Mrs Reed.

43:23.420 --> 43:25.890
Mrs Reed...

43:25.940 --> 43:27.460
you have a daughter.

43:28.820 --> 43:32.140
Yes. Yes, Penny. Your baby is well.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.690
But... but they said she'd suffer.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.490
No, no, Penny, she's...

43:40.540 --> 43:43.900
Forgive the term -- she's "normal" sized.

43:47.260 --> 43:48.740
Don't you mean "big"?

43:54.020 --> 43:56.220
- Congratulations, Mr Reed.
- Thank you.

43:59.660 --> 44:01.180
Thank you.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.290
What if we can't manage her?

44:07.340 --> 44:09.610
What if she can't bear that we're dwarves?

44:09.660 --> 44:12.050
Mrs Reed, I'm not a mother,

44:12.100 --> 44:14.580
but I know what it is to
be a child and to be afraid.

44:17.020 --> 44:19.420
I grew up in a prisoner
of war camp, you see.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.210
Oh.

44:22.260 --> 44:23.490
And, through all of it,

44:23.540 --> 44:26.780
the only thing I was truly
afraid of was losing my mother.

44:27.980 --> 44:32.420
The one who loved me beyond
all fear and all horror.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.770
So do not doubt how much
your child will love you,

44:36.820 --> 44:39.900
or how little she will see
of the things that worry you.

44:42.220 --> 44:43.260
What happened?

44:45.580 --> 44:46.620
She died.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.300
Along with my sister.

44:53.140 --> 44:54.460
And your father?

44:57.220 --> 44:58.500
He survived.

45:00.540 --> 45:04.370
But I think I was so afraid of loss, I...

45:04.420 --> 45:06.140
I closed my heart to him.

45:25.380 --> 45:28.060
The Mount residence.
Who is speaking, please?

45:30.140 --> 45:31.730
It's Patsy.

45:31.780 --> 45:35.700
Miss Mount? Oh, you are
all your father asks for.

45:47.620 --> 45:51.500
Nurse Mount, may I have a
few moments of your time?

45:53.820 --> 45:55.130
Of course, Sister Ursula.

45:55.180 --> 45:56.890
I made it clear, did I not,

45:56.940 --> 46:00.530
that there would be consequences
should you disregard my orders?

46:00.580 --> 46:02.650
Yes. You made it very clear.

46:02.700 --> 46:06.890
And you paid no heed. I thought
you more responsible than that.

46:06.940 --> 46:08.370
And a better nurse.

46:08.420 --> 46:11.770
I'm trying to be the best nurse
and person I can be, Sister.

46:11.820 --> 46:14.740
Well, I find myself obliged
to dock your wages.

46:16.660 --> 46:18.740
You can spare yourself the trouble.

46:20.500 --> 46:24.170
A refund for the time I
spent with Penny Reed.

46:24.220 --> 46:26.330
I came to Nonnatus House precisely because

46:26.380 --> 46:29.490
I wanted to go above and
beyond for my patients,

46:29.540 --> 46:31.730
to be where I was needed most.

46:31.780 --> 46:34.410
And right now, it seems
I'm needed elsewhere.

46:34.460 --> 46:36.980
In Hong Kong. With my dying father.

46:56.740 --> 46:58.100
When will you go?

47:00.300 --> 47:02.780
As soon as I can get
passage from Southampton.

47:04.900 --> 47:09.260
You've made the bravest, most
caring decision that you could.

47:11.020 --> 47:13.530
I'm proud of you, Pats.

47:13.580 --> 47:14.820
How will we manage it?

47:16.500 --> 47:17.820
You and I?

47:19.540 --> 47:23.850
How will we survive the
distance, and the time apart?

47:23.900 --> 47:25.820
We'll do what everyone else does.

47:27.300 --> 47:28.340
We'll write.

47:29.500 --> 47:30.540
We'll wait.

47:32.020 --> 47:33.140
We'll love.

48:01.220 --> 48:03.530
If Mr Marsh is not here
within the next few minutes,

48:03.580 --> 48:05.580
we will move on to the next witness.

48:14.700 --> 48:17.370
Bravo, George.

48:17.420 --> 48:18.930
Help me up, Mrs Turner.

48:18.980 --> 48:20.500
The chair would be easier.

48:21.980 --> 48:23.380
I'm walking in.

48:39.260 --> 48:40.300
Jessie?

48:42.420 --> 48:43.700
I'm here.

48:45.180 --> 48:47.570
I recognised your perfume.

48:47.620 --> 48:49.940
Jessie, I... I'm sorry.

48:51.660 --> 48:53.660
See Mr Marsh is helped to the stand.

49:03.260 --> 49:05.570
I can't. I can't hold her.

49:05.620 --> 49:07.060
My arms are too short.

49:08.460 --> 49:12.260
You've carried this baby for nine
months. You can hold her now.

49:18.420 --> 49:22.260
That's it. You have her
safe. You have her.

49:25.700 --> 49:26.900
Oh, my.

49:28.740 --> 49:29.780
Oh, my.

49:31.500 --> 49:38.780
Where did you come from?
So perfect, so beautiful.

49:40.980 --> 49:43.100
Nurse, we're observing Mrs Reed.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.810
Mr Simkins delivered baby yesterday...

49:46.860 --> 49:47.890
Not today.

49:47.940 --> 49:50.340
Mrs Reed is not a
specimen, she's a mother.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.620
Let her have this moment in private.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.660
I'll tell Mr Simkins about this.

50:12.100 --> 50:13.540
Is she really ours?

50:30.740 --> 50:32.210
I've come from the court.

50:32.260 --> 50:33.890
The verdict's in?

50:33.940 --> 50:36.610
Arthur's death is recorded as an accident.

50:36.660 --> 50:39.050
Accident waiting to happen, more like.

50:39.100 --> 50:44.330
But the coroner is writing to the
port authority, recommending that

50:44.380 --> 50:48.810
there should be fresh water stations
on every dock, a register of men

50:48.860 --> 50:50.450
so their whereabouts are known,

50:50.500 --> 50:54.010
and there will be protective
eyewear for anyone working with

50:54.060 --> 50:56.690
chemicals or flammable substances.

50:56.740 --> 50:59.420
You did it, Mrs Turner!
You made them listen.

51:01.940 --> 51:03.100
George did it.

51:34.460 --> 51:35.980
This is it, then.

51:47.780 --> 51:49.100
Anything?

51:52.660 --> 51:54.580
I got nothing, Doc.

51:58.180 --> 52:00.060
But we got everything else.

52:11.100 --> 52:14.410
Well, little one, you're on fine form,

52:14.460 --> 52:16.210
bright eyed and gaining weight.

52:16.260 --> 52:18.970
I shall follow your progress
from Hong Kong with interest.

52:19.020 --> 52:20.810
I said she'd grown.

52:20.860 --> 52:23.250
That's the spirit, Bella.

52:23.300 --> 52:24.860
What if she outgrows us?

52:27.300 --> 52:32.210
We never really outgrow our
parents, we just think we do.

52:32.260 --> 52:35.930
But what if she thinks us
peculiar next to all the others?

52:35.980 --> 52:41.050
Sometimes we have to stop
wondering and worrying,

52:41.100 --> 52:44.300
and we simply have to
do what scares us most.

52:57.340 --> 52:58.460
I love you.

53:03.940 --> 53:05.340
I can't do this.

53:06.900 --> 53:07.970
You have to.

53:08.020 --> 53:10.700
Your carriage has arrived.
I'll grab your bag.

53:16.260 --> 53:18.490
Goodbye. Safe journey.

53:18.540 --> 53:22.020
- Oh, goodbye!
- Thank you.

53:31.140 --> 53:32.420
Bye, old thing.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.660
(I love you.)

53:48.820 --> 53:50.100
Godspeed!

53:59.980 --> 54:03.220
That's it. Hold his head.

54:12.660 --> 54:15.290
You smell like home.

54:15.340 --> 54:18.340
He's looking at you, George. He knows you.

54:23.700 --> 54:26.050
I love you, little Bobby.

54:26.100 --> 54:29.580
This is us now, all
right? And we will manage.

54:30.940 --> 54:32.580
And we will be grateful.

54:42.020 --> 54:43.970
Keeping up with your Spanish?

54:44.020 --> 54:46.130
I like to chip away at a little every day.

54:46.180 --> 54:49.930
Keeps me occupied, prevents
the mind becoming rusty.

54:49.980 --> 54:51.420
I might take it up myself.

54:58.740 --> 55:00.690
If I may quote a poem.

55:00.740 --> 55:07.210
"For love of you, the air, it
hurts, and my heart, and my hat,

55:07.260 --> 55:09.730
"they hurt me.

55:09.780 --> 55:14.410
"Who would buy it from me,
this ribbon I am holding,

55:14.460 --> 55:19.500
"and this sadness of cotton, white,
for making handkerchiefs with?

55:21.260 --> 55:25.900
"Ay, the pain it costs me
to love you as I love you."

55:27.980 --> 55:30.540
Not my words, but those of Garcia Lorca.

55:32.340 --> 55:37.010
I'm not one for Spanish poetry
-- give me Tennyson any day --

55:37.060 --> 55:39.420
but I find his words move me.

55:41.260 --> 55:44.250
I have a volume of his poems in English,

55:44.300 --> 55:46.100
if you should care to borrow it.

55:48.580 --> 55:49.980
And, if I may...

55:51.740 --> 55:56.650
.. the pain it costs to love,

55:56.700 --> 55:59.380
I believe it is always worth it.

56:05.100 --> 56:07.450
I'll leave the volume by your door.

56:07.500 --> 56:10.740
If we might put a two-week limit
on the loan, I should appreciate it.
