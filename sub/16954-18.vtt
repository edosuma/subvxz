09:15.688 --> 09:17.623

On a scale of one to ten,
ten being, like,

09:19.325 --> 09:20.726

09:20.793 --> 09:23.663
- Seven.
- Oh, God, it was that bad?

09:23.729 --> 09:26.098
- It was, uh, chalky

09:26.165 --> 09:29.235
and it didn't have really
noodles in it.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.437

{\an1}- I had been dieting,
but I had lost 40 pounds...

09:44.016 --> 09:46.419
- Wow.
- And I changed my medication

09:46.485 --> 09:48.754

- Mailing it.

are gonna stay with her

take the counselor's advice

11:47.273 --> 11:49.341

11:49.408 --> 11:51.977
- Um, well, we always, like,
would send little, like--

11:52.044 --> 11:53.913
a card or something or,
like, for Easter,

11:53.979 --> 11:55.147
I got her a little teddy where
it said, like,

11:55.214 --> 11:57.049
{\an1}"Somebody from St. Clair
loves you."

11:57.116 --> 11:58.851
{\an1}You know, like,
little things like that.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.519
But yeah,
I think what she meant by that

12:00.586 --> 12:02.388
was just, like, you know, now
she's getting to the age where

12:02.455 --> 12:04.290
she's gonna start
asking questions and stuff.

12:04.356 --> 12:06.092
{\an1}And I think there probably
was a part of, like,

12:06.158 --> 12:08.260
you know, we talked to Dawn,
there maybe a piece of grief

12:08.327 --> 12:09.662
going on there.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.464
You know, 'cause I feel like,

12:11.530 --> 12:13.466
it's like you're always
going through something.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.900
So I think, maybe
subconsciously, in a way,

12:14.967 --> 12:16.502
like Ty said, maybe we
were trying to just connect.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.204

our own family, you know,

12:18.270 --> 12:21.040
starting now, and things
get crazy, life gets crazy.

12:23.109 --> 12:24.643
{\an3}about you talking
about them on the show,

12:24.710 --> 12:27.546
{\an3}so how are
your visits going?

12:27.613 --> 12:30.583
- So I'm not sure when, exactly,
it will happen,

12:30.649 --> 12:33.219
but they're not the types
of people to just, I feel like,

12:33.285 --> 12:35.387
totally cut me off
and not talk to me.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.690
We still text and talk
on the phone and stuff, so...

12:37.756 --> 12:40.226
{\an3}- Now, for the other moms,
what do you think about

12:40.292 --> 12:42.962
Brandon and Teresa not wanting
to be involved in the show

12:43.028 --> 12:45.631

making it clear

12:45.698 --> 12:47.600
where they stand
with everything.

12:47.666 --> 12:50.336
- I see both sides.

12:50.402 --> 12:52.004
{\an3}And it's...

12:52.071 --> 12:55.774
for me, because I'm
so close with Catelynn...

12:55.841 --> 12:58.410
- Right.
- And Tyler, it, like--

12:58.477 --> 13:01.780
{\an3}I hurt for them
in that situation.

13:01.847 --> 13:05.251
Um, because, you know,
we all do this show

13:05.317 --> 13:08.020

and what we're going through

13:08.087 --> 13:11.957
for other people that might be
going through the same thing.

13:12.024 --> 13:16.595
{\an3}And so, it's--I can only imagine
how difficult it would be

13:16.662 --> 13:19.732

say that again, Amber?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.519

what happened.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.526

16:34.593 --> 16:36.195

- Mm-hmm.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.263

16:38.330 --> 16:40.766

16:47.506 --> 16:48.640

16:48.707 --> 16:50.309

16:50.376 --> 16:51.877

behind me,

16:57.950 --> 16:58.951

16:59.017 --> 17:00.352
- Well, 'cause I'm, like--

17:00.419 --> 17:02.421
{\an3}I'm screaming at the TV, like,
"Holy [bleep]!

17:02.488 --> 17:03.956

17:04.021 --> 17:05.424

I hear sweet little Maci,

17:07.393 --> 17:08.861
{\an1}"Um, I think we
need to go get her."

17:08.926 --> 17:10.362

we do need to go get her."

17:10.429 --> 17:12.131
{\an3}- I was trying not
to [bleep] draw attention.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.699
Like, I didn't want
anyone to follow us,

17:13.766 --> 17:16.367

"Hey, we should go get Amber."

17:16.435 --> 17:18.270
And then I'm like,
"Let's [bleep] go."

17:18.337 --> 17:19.905
[laughter]
Let's go.

17:19.972 --> 17:23.308

stick up for yourself.

something that we have been

17:57.810 --> 18:00.446

I am 26 years old today.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.581
{\an3}- And he just walked in

18:02.648 --> 18:04.650

18:04.716 --> 18:07.686

to help improve

18:07.753 --> 18:10.923

um, addiction,

18:14.693 --> 18:16.929

- Everything.

18:16.995 --> 18:20.098

18:20.165 --> 18:24.403

who are doing good

18:24.470 --> 18:26.038
