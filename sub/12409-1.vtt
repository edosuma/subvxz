00:20.075 --> 00:21.992
Oh, I have to...

00:24.033 --> 00:26.658
God, I can't focus. Oh, Michael.

00:26.742 --> 00:28.283
- Yes, hi.
- Here it is.

00:28.367 --> 00:29.367
- Is this all it?
- Yeah.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.617
- Okay, I'm gonna tape this to the stool.
- Thank you.

00:31.700 --> 00:35.158
Hi, Sarah and Zach.
Thanks for coming.

00:35.242 --> 00:36.450
Ow!

00:36.533 --> 00:38.617
Sorry. Thanks for coming.

00:39.867 --> 00:41.950
Why won't anyone be nice to me?

00:42.033 --> 00:43.950
- It's hard being Tig.
- Mmm.

00:44.033 --> 00:45.783
- Hi, Tig.
- Hi, Zach.

00:45.867 --> 00:47.742
I can't do it for much longer.

00:47.825 --> 00:51.408
- Hey, Tig, happy anniversary.
- Thank you.

00:51.492 --> 00:54.408
- How much time do you want me to do?
- What would you like to do?

00:54.492 --> 00:57.742
- Zero.
- Okay. Perfect.

00:57.825 --> 01:01.908
- Can you do 15?
- I'll try. I have a tight five.

01:01.992 --> 01:03.242
Okay.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.908
Fifteen.

01:05.992 --> 01:08.700
- How much are you gonna do, Tig?
- Probably 45.

01:08.783 --> 01:09.825
- Oh, you are?
- Yeah.

01:09.908 --> 01:11.325
Oh, okay.

01:11.408 --> 01:12.908
Uh, what?

01:12.992 --> 01:14.700
- I know.
- You're gonna host?

01:14.783 --> 01:15.908
No, I think I'm gonna go first.

01:15.992 --> 01:16.950
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.450
- And then Sarah, and then me.
- Lovely.

01:19.533 --> 01:23.533
Do you want an introduction at the top,
or do you wanna walk out?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.867
- I should--
- Louis C.K. just walks out.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.825
- You should do what Louis does.
- And he did last night.

01:27.908 --> 01:29.742
F U, C.K.

01:30.617 --> 01:33.408
What if this show is a bomb?

01:33.492 --> 01:35.783
Oh, my God,
it's not gonna happen.

01:35.867 --> 01:38.450
Comedy is always a risk.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.783
But, a year ago today,

01:40.867 --> 01:45.033
when I was waiting over there
for Ed to announce me,

01:45.117 --> 01:47.200
I was just, like,

01:47.283 --> 01:51.908
"No idea how this is gonna go.
No idea how this is gonna go."

01:51.992 --> 01:53.908
Good evening, hello.

01:55.950 --> 01:59.450
I have cancer, how are you?

01:59.533 --> 02:04.492
I came on stage not knowing
if I was gonna live or die.

02:05.908 --> 02:09.866
And because my life
had fallen apart so quickly,

02:09.949 --> 02:12.533
I kind of assumed I was gonna die.

03:07.575 --> 03:09.783
I was talking to a friend of mine,
and she said,

03:09.867 --> 03:11.950
"Yeah, I stayed up late
watching the Princess Diana funeral."

03:12.033 --> 03:13.325
She said,
"But after a while it was just

03:13.408 --> 03:16.242
the car going down the road
with a casket in back."

03:16.325 --> 03:19.283
She said, "I got so bored,
I ended up turning it off."

03:19.367 --> 03:20.950
She said, "Did you see it?"
And I said, "Yeah."

03:21.033 --> 03:23.450
And she said,
"Well, what ended up happening?"

03:25.450 --> 03:28.908
In high school, I was, um...

03:28.992 --> 03:31.617
I was voted least likely.

03:39.617 --> 03:43.033
I've been runnin' with it ever since.

03:43.117 --> 03:44.533
I hated school.

03:44.617 --> 03:48.117
I failed three grades
and then dropped out.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.117
I'm pretty psyched
about how things are going.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.242
But I did get my GED.

03:53.325 --> 03:57.575
Not only has nobody
ever asked to see my GED,

03:57.658 --> 03:59.075
but my cat ate it.

04:00.158 --> 04:03.617
The last grade I graduated
was seventh grade.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.450
I have a seventh grade education.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
Thank you.

04:11.283 --> 04:16.533
I struggled in other jobs
and been miserable and failed at 'em all.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.950
Stand-up was that thing
that when I found it,

04:19.033 --> 04:21.367
I was like,
"Oh! I'm a comedian.

04:21.450 --> 04:23.700
Why didn't anyone tell me?"

04:24.450 --> 04:27.158
People always have a hard time
understanding my name,

04:27.242 --> 04:28.617
especially over the phone.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.033
I was on this call with this guy,
and we were gonna hang up

04:31.117 --> 04:32.700
and he's like,
"All right, well, look.

04:32.783 --> 04:35.950
I don't feel real comfortable
callin' you this,

04:36.033 --> 04:38.450
but I guess I'll see you tonight, pig."

04:42.992 --> 04:46.617
I was like,
"Well, you know, to tell you the truth,

04:46.700 --> 04:49.950
I don't feel real comfortable
with you calling me pig either."

04:51.200 --> 04:53.617
You're treated like nothing
in the early days,

04:53.700 --> 04:55.450
and you're making no money.

04:55.533 --> 05:00.200
You know, I would camp in my car
in-between gigs.

05:00.283 --> 05:04.200
I had never been so happy
and fulfilled in my life.

05:05.117 --> 05:06.742
One of my favorite things
about doing stand-up

05:06.825 --> 05:08.742
is when comedians
take the mic out of the mic stand,

05:08.825 --> 05:11.700
then move the mic stand out of the way.

05:11.783 --> 05:14.033
Some comedians move it even further.

05:15.867 --> 05:18.075
It's like,
"Where are you headed?"

05:19.617 --> 05:23.783
"Where does this go?
Got to get this out of the way."

05:29.908 --> 05:31.408
Do you work here?

05:32.658 --> 05:34.367
Can you hold this?

05:39.492 --> 05:41.117
When a show is going well,

05:41.200 --> 05:45.325
it's just, kind of, the ultimate.
It's the peak.

05:47.075 --> 05:48.950
It's such a rush.

05:49.033 --> 05:51.283
It's a room full of,
"Oh, I get you."

05:51.367 --> 05:55.450
They get me, I get them,
and they get the person next to them.

05:55.533 --> 05:58.908
Everyone is like,
"Yeah, we get it."

05:58.992 --> 06:03.158
My next guest is a comedian
who hosts the podcast Professor Blastoff.

06:03.242 --> 06:06.450
You can catch her every month
at the Largo theater here in L.A.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.658
She just released her debut album,
Good One.

06:08.742 --> 06:10.617
Please welcome
the very funny Tig Notaro.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.117
Tig Notaro, everybody!

06:12.200 --> 06:14.325
Hi.

06:20.908 --> 06:23.492
Uh, how's it going? Good.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.242
I live here in Los Angeles,

06:26.325 --> 06:29.867
and I was walking through my neighborhood
down the sidewalk,

06:29.950 --> 06:32.117
and I was passing this guy,

06:32.200 --> 06:34.742
and right when we were passing each other,

06:34.825 --> 06:37.450
right when we were passing each other,
he said to me,

06:37.533 --> 06:40.908
"Ah, them little titties.

06:42.492 --> 06:44.200
I thought you was a man."

06:45.325 --> 06:47.075
It's like, "Okay.

06:48.408 --> 06:52.950
Okay, if you think that.
And okay if you say that,

06:53.033 --> 06:54.533
to yourself."

06:56.283 --> 07:03.033
But that thought had to go through
several layers of filters in his mind,

07:03.117 --> 07:05.075
and a checklist,

07:05.158 --> 07:08.117
and he still decided,

07:08.200 --> 07:11.325
"Yeah, I'm gonna need to say this."

07:11.408 --> 07:15.617
My career has always been just,
kind of, going steadily up.

07:15.700 --> 07:20.033
In early 2012,
I was busier than I'd ever been.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.783
I was touring all over the country,

07:23.867 --> 07:28.033
I was doing my weekly podcast,
Professor Blastoff.

07:28.117 --> 07:31.617
I was doing a regular show at Largo.

07:31.700 --> 07:36.242
I was in a pilot,
and something that was very exciting,

07:36.325 --> 07:38.242
I was gonna try and get pregnant.

07:39.367 --> 07:44.450
I was working more in town
than out of town, and that's...

07:44.533 --> 07:48.575
That crucial element to
having a child and a family

07:48.658 --> 07:50.367
is that you have to be home.

07:50.450 --> 07:54.700
And that was starting to look
way more possible than ever.

07:56.033 --> 07:57.783
- Sound speeding.
- A only mark.

07:57.867 --> 08:01.450
And from Tig's entrance.

08:01.533 --> 08:02.742
Action.

08:02.825 --> 08:05.242
Have you seen my stress ball?

08:05.325 --> 08:06.325
God!

08:06.408 --> 08:11.492
I was filming the movie In A World
and I was like, "I don't feel well."

08:11.575 --> 08:13.533
A only mark.

08:13.617 --> 08:18.283
I was aware that she was sick,
but she seemed great and fine,

08:18.367 --> 08:19.887
and was making jokes and really funny.

08:19.950 --> 08:21.825
"What?"

08:21.908 --> 08:23.783
It didn't seem that serious.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.283
Uh, tell me more here.

08:27.367 --> 08:28.867
Mark.

08:38.158 --> 08:41.158
At the end,
I was lying down in-between shots

08:41.241 --> 08:42.700
just trying to rest.

08:43.866 --> 08:47.408
And then I collapsed.

08:48.825 --> 08:51.367
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe you're in the hospital.

08:52.617 --> 08:55.158
Tig?
Oh, my God, what happened?

08:56.908 --> 08:58.533
Hi, Tig.
It's your mommy.

08:58.617 --> 09:03.158
I hope you're feeling better.
Give me a call, and I'll be happy.

09:12.367 --> 09:15.325
I was in so much pain.

09:15.408 --> 09:20.450
The doctor said my insides
were inflamed beyond recognition.

09:21.617 --> 09:24.075
And he didn't know what was wrong.

09:24.158 --> 09:25.617
She just was so sick.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.617
You know, when someone doesn't complain
and you really see pain on their face,

09:29.700 --> 09:32.242
it's a lot scarier.

09:32.992 --> 09:36.242
After, like, a week,
it wasn't going away.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.367
And I thought, like,
she might not make it.

09:41.658 --> 09:42.950
The doctor said,

09:43.033 --> 09:46.367
"We're gonna test you
for this thing called C. Diff,

09:46.450 --> 09:50.200
and we hope it's not that."

09:51.617 --> 09:52.700
But it was.

09:54.575 --> 09:59.492
C. Diff is a bacteria that will just
take over your entire digestive tract

09:59.575 --> 10:02.242
and eat it alive.

10:02.325 --> 10:06.367
I couldn't eat food.
I lost over 20 pounds.

10:06.450 --> 10:07.992
I had become a skeleton.

10:12.908 --> 10:16.367
The day she got into a chair,
that was a big moment.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.617
Sweetie, who got themselves
into a chair all by themselves?

10:19.700 --> 10:22.200
- I did.
- That's right, you did.

10:22.283 --> 10:24.450
It was us being, like, excited

10:24.533 --> 10:27.242
that she was able to get up
and sit in a chair.

10:28.825 --> 10:32.450
I got out of the hospital
a week before my 41st birthday.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.450
I was thrilled to be out of the hospital.

10:34.533 --> 10:37.867
But I was still in a lot of pain.
I was very weak.

10:37.950 --> 10:42.075
When I was diagnosed with C. Diff,
I thought it was...

10:42.158 --> 10:47.117
It was the worst possible news...
up until that point.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.408
I had no idea what was to come.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.533
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

10:57.617 --> 10:59.867
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

10:59.950 --> 11:05.200
♪ Happy birthday, dear Fluff
Happy birthday to you ♪

11:05.283 --> 11:07.200
Ric and I wanna come out to California.

11:07.283 --> 11:08.325
Happy birthday.

11:08.408 --> 11:09.867
We wanna come out and visit.

11:09.950 --> 11:11.283
I love you.

11:12.867 --> 11:15.950
A couple days after my birthday,

11:17.242 --> 11:22.033
my phone rang and it said, "Parents."

11:22.117 --> 11:26.075
I missed the call again,
and it went to voicemail,

11:26.158 --> 11:30.450
and I thought, "That's probably my mother
calling to wish me happy birthday again."

11:32.533 --> 11:36.950
Hi, Tig.
I'm afraid I have some terrible news.

11:37.033 --> 11:41.075
Your mother fell last night and, uh...

11:41.158 --> 11:44.158
it looks like she's not gonna make it.

11:44.242 --> 11:45.908
Please give me a call.

11:57.367 --> 12:02.908
My mother and my stepfather
were watching Jimmy Kimmel,

12:02.992 --> 12:08.158
and she got up and fell.
Hit her head.

12:08.242 --> 12:14.033
My stepfather checked her head,
and she was talking and seemingly okay.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.492
He decided to go to bed,
and she stayed up.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.617
In the morning,

12:24.700 --> 12:29.783
Ric saw that she had blood
coming from her nose and mouth.

12:29.867 --> 12:34.200
She was never... never conscious again.

12:37.867 --> 12:43.658
My brother, Ric and I went to the hospital
to say our goodbyes.

12:44.658 --> 12:47.992
She lived 12 hours off of life support,

12:48.075 --> 12:52.158
and it was really horrendous.

12:52.242 --> 12:55.992
My brother and stepfather
ended up going home,

12:56.075 --> 12:58.283
and I was just there by myself.

12:59.492 --> 13:02.992
They said there was zero brain activity,
and I believed that,

13:03.075 --> 13:07.033
but I made up in my mind

13:07.117 --> 13:09.033
that she knew I was there.

13:10.325 --> 13:11.325
I just...

13:12.700 --> 13:14.575
really...

13:15.950 --> 13:19.033
wanted her to know that I was there.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.783
And that there was no way
I was gonna leave.

13:39.700 --> 13:44.117
After the funeral,
I was too sick to go back to Los Angeles,

13:44.200 --> 13:46.575
and so I just stayed in Texas.

13:46.658 --> 13:48.742
This is the house where she fell.

13:50.367 --> 13:54.742
You know, there's moments
of sadness and realization.

13:54.825 --> 13:59.158
You know, my mother's
not in the house and, um...

14:01.158 --> 14:03.367
My mother's dead.

14:06.408 --> 14:07.450
Ric?

14:07.533 --> 14:08.950
I'm in here, Tig.

14:09.033 --> 14:10.117
Hi.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.492
My mother and I had very
up and down times in our relationship,

14:13.575 --> 14:17.617
but we loved each other so tremendously.

14:20.908 --> 14:24.158
My mother was hilarious,

14:24.242 --> 14:29.367
very silly and ridiculous,
and wild and crazy.

14:29.450 --> 14:33.575
Not concerned at all about
what anybody thought about her.

14:35.033 --> 14:39.700
My mother was very comfortable
when things were uncomfortable.

14:39.783 --> 14:44.533
And my humor is
directly tied to her sensibility.

14:45.450 --> 14:47.450
She was very into pranks.

14:47.533 --> 14:50.408
Friends would come over to eat,
and she'd be like, "Tig,

14:50.492 --> 14:53.908
I'm dying everyone's potatoes blue.
Don't tell your friends."

14:53.992 --> 14:55.783
And I'd be like,
"Okay." You know.

14:55.867 --> 14:59.617
And so we would all pretend
like mashed potatoes are blue.

15:00.617 --> 15:04.117
She had this fierce inner strength.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.408
When I had issues as a kid, like,
"Oh, this is happening,"

15:07.492 --> 15:09.867
she would always be like, you know,
"Tell 'em to go to hell.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.283
If they have a problem,
tell 'em to go to hell."

15:11.367 --> 15:16.908
And it just... It gave me this confidence
to not question myself or doubt myself.

15:17.867 --> 15:20.408
A parent is supposed
to understand a child,

15:20.492 --> 15:23.575
and I'd never really understood Tig.

15:23.658 --> 15:27.950
I had a model of what a person should do,

15:28.033 --> 15:31.325
and Tig was having nothing of that.

15:32.033 --> 15:36.867
My mother understood me in a way
that was different from other people.

15:38.033 --> 15:39.742
When I lost my mother,

15:39.825 --> 15:45.158
I truly lost the person
that understood me the most.

15:54.408 --> 15:59.450
When I was at my mother's house
after she died, I was really devastated.

15:59.533 --> 16:01.408
And I was still so ill.

16:01.492 --> 16:06.575
So it just seemed to be this tunnel
that I would see the light at the end,

16:06.658 --> 16:08.818
but then it was like somebody
put another tunnel on it.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.158
- Take care. I love you.
- All right. I love you, too.

16:11.242 --> 16:13.867
I needed something positive to happen.

16:14.950 --> 16:16.450
We had this show booked

16:16.533 --> 16:18.617
where we were gonna do an episode
of This American Life.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.617
We were gonna do it onstage
in New York City,

16:20.700 --> 16:23.575
and beam it into movie theaters
around the country.

16:23.658 --> 16:26.242
And, uh, Tig was one of the performers.

16:26.325 --> 16:30.533
Ira and I were planning
this show for nine months.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.950
I was warning him I had been sick,
and he said,

16:35.033 --> 16:37.783
"Don't push yourself.
We can do this another time."

16:37.867 --> 16:39.867
And I was just like,
"You don't understand."

16:40.617 --> 16:44.117
And I felt like, "If I could just get to
New York and do This American Life,

16:44.200 --> 16:49.825
I would feel like finally
I was coming through something."

16:49.908 --> 16:51.075
Welcome comedian Tig Notaro.

16:57.783 --> 17:01.533
I went to this party with my friend Pam,

17:01.617 --> 17:06.242
and we were going to leave the party,
and she said to me,

17:06.325 --> 17:09.407
"Do you know who that was
standing by the door?"

17:09.492 --> 17:12.242
I said, "No."

17:12.325 --> 17:14.950
She said, "That was Taylor Dayne."

17:17.867 --> 17:20.367
Do you know who Taylor Dayne is? No?

17:20.450 --> 17:25.117
She was a pop singer
in the late '80s, early '90s.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.575
She sang "Love Will Lead You Back."

17:32.200 --> 17:35.867
Anyway, I love Taylor Dayne,

17:35.950 --> 17:37.450
and not ironically.

17:39.742 --> 17:41.367
And I went up to her, and I said,

17:41.450 --> 17:44.825
"Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you,

17:44.908 --> 17:48.367
but I just have to tell you,
I love your voice."

17:49.408 --> 17:53.075
And she just turned and said,
"Yeah, I don't do that anymore."

17:54.575 --> 17:57.158
Tig is a really pure
kind of deadpan,

17:57.242 --> 18:00.117
incredibly special performer.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.450
She's somebody
who is just in no hurry at all.

18:02.533 --> 18:05.783
Like, it's just somebody
with such supreme confidence

18:05.867 --> 18:09.033
that she will just
pause and hold a moment.

18:09.658 --> 18:11.700
Then, like, nine months passed.

18:12.908 --> 18:16.992
And I happened to be out to eat
with that same friend of mine, Pam.

18:17.075 --> 18:20.575
And there was a party of ten
seated right behind us.

18:21.908 --> 18:24.783
You guys are not gonna believe
who was sitting there.

18:29.825 --> 18:31.200
Any guesses?

18:35.867 --> 18:37.242
- What's that?
- Taylor Dayne.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.450
That's correct.

18:40.658 --> 18:42.367
It was Taylor Dayne.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.158
Tig really
just brought down the house.

18:44.242 --> 18:46.242
And immediately when we got done
with that, I was like,

18:46.325 --> 18:48.617
"Okay, what else you got?
You're now, like, an audience favorite.

18:48.700 --> 18:51.617
Like, you know, our whole radio audience,
millions of people,

18:51.700 --> 18:53.950
they wanna hear you again.
What else you got?"

18:54.033 --> 18:59.200
He suggested doing a piece
about the recent tragedies in my life.

18:59.283 --> 19:02.408
He said, "You need to do that on stage."

19:02.492 --> 19:06.450
Well, first of all, she made it clear,
she had no interest in that at all.

19:06.533 --> 19:09.450
I guess there was a part of me
that was a little offended

19:09.533 --> 19:13.325
that he would think that
there was humor in this.

19:13.408 --> 19:15.283
She didn't know
how she would go about that,

19:15.367 --> 19:19.617
and she was just, like, it didn't seem fun
or interesting in any way at all.

19:22.158 --> 19:24.950
Like, of course he knew
I was not gonna do this material.

19:25.033 --> 19:30.825
Like, what, "My mother died, and I
can't eat food and I'm withering away.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.700
Ladies, you know what I'm talking about."

19:33.783 --> 19:37.200
You know, it's like, what?
Where is the humor? I didn't get it.

19:44.992 --> 19:47.867
And then, I found a lump.

19:50.283 --> 19:52.450
The doctor came in and she said,

19:52.533 --> 19:55.992
"We saw the lump.

19:56.075 --> 19:58.867
We found another one."

20:00.492 --> 20:05.075
And I said, "Wait a minute.
Are you saying that I have cancer?"

20:08.408 --> 20:12.742
She said, "It is very likely that you do."

20:14.742 --> 20:17.867
And I was like...
Immediately in my head, I was like,

20:17.950 --> 20:21.033
"Wait a minute. My mother just died.

20:21.117 --> 20:25.325
How could this happen?
Like, I've already been through all this."

20:25.408 --> 20:28.325
Like, I wanted to pull out
these calling cards.

20:28.408 --> 20:31.992
Like, "No, look,
I just went through all this stuff,

20:32.075 --> 20:34.033
and I can't have cancer."

20:38.533 --> 20:40.700
I happened to be sobbing
on the sidewalk,

20:40.783 --> 20:44.492
and Flanagan,
the owner of Largo, sent me a text,

20:44.575 --> 20:46.367
"Are we doing the show or not?"

20:47.742 --> 20:50.158
I just... I love stand-up so much.

20:50.242 --> 20:53.700
I wanted to do it one more time.

20:56.700 --> 20:59.825
Maybe that seems utterly insane,

20:59.908 --> 21:02.908
but as soon as
I was diagnosed with cancer,

21:02.992 --> 21:05.950
everything came over me as funny.

21:06.033 --> 21:10.408
And I got a sense of humor
'cause it just was so ridiculous.

21:11.617 --> 21:15.117
After everything that had happened,
I have cancer?

21:15.200 --> 21:17.075
And so, I just started writing.

21:22.075 --> 21:24.408
That was such a major risk,

21:24.492 --> 21:28.200
'cause it could have
easily been my last show ever

21:28.283 --> 21:33.825
that bombed awkwardly
and then I died.

21:36.867 --> 21:38.783
I'm now very thrilled,

21:38.867 --> 21:41.700
and it is my great privilege
to bring to the stage.

21:41.783 --> 21:42.908
Tig Notaro.

21:48.283 --> 21:49.783
Hello.

21:54.033 --> 21:55.700
Good evening, hello.

22:07.450 --> 22:13.117
People were laughing and staring at,
like, "This is a weird opening."

22:37.575 --> 22:39.617
When people were realizing it was true,

22:39.700 --> 22:42.867
I was also seeing people
crying in the audience.

22:42.950 --> 22:46.533
And it was...
It was very intense

22:46.617 --> 22:51.575
because it was also reflecting back at me.
Like, this is really happening to you.

23:18.825 --> 23:20.617
It's one of those rare times
I've had as--

23:20.700 --> 23:22.950
I've had it, like, maybe three times
in my career,

23:23.033 --> 23:25.533
where the person going on
in front of you is so good,

23:25.617 --> 23:28.617
you stop being the next comic,
and you become an audience member.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.408
I texted my girlfriend,

23:30.492 --> 23:33.325
I was sitting there watching,
and I texted,

23:33.408 --> 23:36.867
"Tig is doing something
historic right now."

24:09.867 --> 24:11.575
You know, I stood behind this piano

24:11.658 --> 24:14.950
and Tig was there,
and Louis was behind that curtain.

24:15.033 --> 24:16.992
And so, I'm looking at Louis
and he's crying.

24:17.075 --> 24:18.950
And I was crying,
and we're laughing.

24:19.033 --> 24:20.950
And then I could see
the audience's reactions, as well.

24:21.033 --> 24:22.658
And the audience were, like,
standing up and clapping,

24:22.742 --> 24:24.283
and then sitting down.

24:24.367 --> 24:25.992
And then she was saying,
"Oh, don't be so sad."

24:26.075 --> 24:27.658
And people were, like...
Didn't know really quite...

24:27.742 --> 24:30.450
But everybody felt to be
into the spirit of it.

24:59.700 --> 25:03.575
I remember turning around on stage,
and I almost started crying

25:03.658 --> 25:06.408
when that guy just yelled out
for me to not stop.

25:08.033 --> 25:10.617
They gave me a standing ovation,

25:10.700 --> 25:14.367
but I had zero sense that that show
was gonna change my life.

25:39.242 --> 25:40.450
I woke up the next day,

25:40.533 --> 25:42.950
I had hundreds of e-mails.

25:43.033 --> 25:46.575
My voicemail was full,
text messages would not stop.

25:46.658 --> 25:49.408
I was like, "What happened?"

25:49.492 --> 25:52.783
- It went viral overnight.
- And I was like...

25:59.033 --> 26:02.825
"Okay. I didn't understand...
What went viral?" You know.

26:02.908 --> 26:05.242
There was no video.
There was nothing there.

26:05.325 --> 26:09.492
It was just the idea
that this show happened went viral.

26:09.575 --> 26:13.283
All these huge publications
were wanting to talk to me.

26:13.367 --> 26:16.867
Louis C.K. was saying,
"Everyone needs to hear that show.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.117
You should release it as an album."

26:19.200 --> 26:21.658
And there were book offers coming in.

26:21.742 --> 26:26.867
I was thinking, "Am I even gonna be alive
to finish a book?"

26:31.450 --> 26:35.992
Some days, I felt on top of the world
and, like, "I'm gonna beat this."

26:36.075 --> 26:42.408
And then I would be in bed the next minute
or the next day in fetal position,

26:42.492 --> 26:45.867
staring at my ceiling, just, like,

26:45.950 --> 26:49.658
"What is happening, and I'm gonna die,
and I want my mother."

26:49.742 --> 26:53.533
And it was just hitting me
that I was on my own,

26:53.617 --> 26:55.617
in a massive way.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.658
Do it, Todd!

27:01.742 --> 27:03.950
- Who will do a set?
- Todd!

27:04.033 --> 27:06.283
Do your Conan set.

27:06.367 --> 27:07.450
Do it.

27:07.533 --> 27:10.242
I'm riddled with cancer.

27:10.325 --> 27:11.783
Come on, Todd.

27:11.867 --> 27:13.700
Poor Todd.

27:13.783 --> 27:15.658
Sarah, you get it going. Do a set.

27:15.742 --> 27:16.908
Well, okay!

27:21.658 --> 27:22.950
Oh, is this funny?

27:23.033 --> 27:24.950
If I go like,
"Can I ask you something?

27:25.033 --> 27:26.867
And be honest with me."

27:26.950 --> 27:28.617
And the person's like, "Of course."

27:28.700 --> 27:30.075
"Are you farting?"

27:31.367 --> 27:32.867
I hope that's funny.

27:32.950 --> 27:34.158
I think that's funny.

27:34.242 --> 27:36.158
It takes a while to get there.

27:36.242 --> 27:38.367
It's a thinker.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.617
And a stinker.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.158
Tig, you still got it.

27:42.242 --> 27:44.617
- Sarah?
- I'm looking at jokes.

27:44.700 --> 27:46.617
You didn't think
what I said was funny?

27:46.700 --> 27:47.783
A stinker?

27:47.867 --> 27:50.533
You said it was a thinker,
and I said it was a stinker.

27:50.617 --> 27:53.367
I did think it was funny. I'm sorry.

27:53.450 --> 27:55.950
I was thinking about me
and my laughs.

27:56.033 --> 27:58.283
This show is awkward.

28:00.867 --> 28:05.950
When I came out of surgery,
I woke up to my doctor saying...

28:07.367 --> 28:12.200
"We got it all. You're gonna be fine.
It didn't spread."

28:12.283 --> 28:16.200
And I was just like,
"Oh, my God."

28:16.283 --> 28:20.283
Just the relief of,
"Wait, so this is over now?"

28:20.367 --> 28:22.117
What is your latest prognosis?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.617
- Well, I had--
- 'Cause you had the surgery.

28:23.700 --> 28:26.700
I had surgery, I did.
Yeah. Double mastectomy.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.283
Who's your doctor, the Fonz?

28:34.200 --> 28:36.700
They got all the cancer
and it did not spread.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.783
And my prognosis is great, so...

28:43.450 --> 28:46.742
Best news anybody here
has heard in a long time.

28:51.867 --> 28:57.200
When the album came out,
I was getting e-mails from Louis,

28:57.283 --> 29:02.950
like, every hour.
Just clearly giddy.

29:03.033 --> 29:05.533
5,000, 10,000, 25...

29:05.617 --> 29:08.408
You know, it just kept growing
and growing, and I was like,

29:09.242 --> 29:11.367
"That is so crazy."

29:17.825 --> 29:19.783
You had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

29:19.867 --> 29:21.700
You were diagnosed with cancer.

29:22.742 --> 29:25.182
Things really blew up for you
with this one show at the Largo.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.950
You had a deadly colon infection,

29:27.033 --> 29:28.742
your mother passed away,

29:28.825 --> 29:30.992
then you were diagnosed with cancer.

29:33.867 --> 29:35.533
- There you go. Great.
- Awesome.

29:35.617 --> 29:36.617
This is Live.

29:36.700 --> 29:37.950
- I'm pronouncing this correctly?
- Yeah.

29:38.033 --> 29:40.700
I like the idea
that people will always think

29:40.783 --> 29:43.492
it's Tig Notaro Live.

29:43.575 --> 29:45.325
And...

29:49.200 --> 29:53.700
I'll always have to correct them and say,
"No, it's Live."

29:55.783 --> 30:00.492
I also had breast cancer
and had a bilateral mastectomy as well.

30:00.575 --> 30:03.283
It's not that cancer or breast cancer
is not serious,

30:03.367 --> 30:05.117
it's not that losing your breasts
is not serious.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.033
All of it sucks.

30:07.117 --> 30:08.117
Hey.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.908
It was just so nice to hear somebody
make a joke about it.

30:11.992 --> 30:13.575
My mom had cancer.

30:13.658 --> 30:17.367
I just wanna thank you
for the example you were

30:17.450 --> 30:20.533
of just being real about life.

30:21.158 --> 30:23.450
- How're you feeling? You good?
- Scared.

30:23.533 --> 30:28.950
Meanwhile, underneath my shirt,
the non-glamorous side of things is...

30:29.033 --> 30:32.033
I have scars across my chest
and no nipples.

30:32.117 --> 30:36.658
And my mother got up
to probably go to the bathroom.

30:36.742 --> 30:38.450
She's dead.

30:40.950 --> 30:44.450
The press was amazing
and the people were great.

30:44.533 --> 30:46.325
But the hype definitely stressed me out.

30:46.408 --> 30:47.408
Well, again...

30:47.492 --> 30:50.783
Getting interviewed
several times a day

30:50.867 --> 30:53.450
and being asked, in every interview,

30:53.533 --> 30:55.158
"What is your comedy like?

30:55.992 --> 31:00.367
Are you a different comedian?
What is your material? Who are you now?"

31:01.033 --> 31:05.242
It's pressure, like,
"Gosh, I don't even know."

31:05.325 --> 31:08.408
Hi. My name is Tig Notaro.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.658
I had cancer

31:10.742 --> 31:13.283
and now people take my picture a lot.

31:13.367 --> 31:17.200
Even after my scars healed
and I was in remission,

31:17.283 --> 31:21.200
I couldn't process
everything that was happening.

31:27.367 --> 31:30.950
So how does that work? Comedians,
like, when you release an album like that?

31:31.033 --> 31:33.742
Do you, like, do a tour,
where you kind of go around?

31:33.825 --> 31:34.825
I mean, typically...

31:34.908 --> 31:36.783
'Cause obviously you're not
gonna repeat the show.

31:36.867 --> 31:37.950
Yeah, no.

31:38.033 --> 31:40.533
Do you go on a little tour
at least just to promote it?

31:40.617 --> 31:42.033
I mean, typically, I would.

31:42.117 --> 31:45.408
But now, I'm in this weird place

31:45.492 --> 31:48.117
where I can't really go on stage
and be like, "Hi, I have cancer."

31:48.200 --> 31:49.492
You're right.

31:49.575 --> 31:54.242
So I'm just trying to write new material
so I can start touring again.

31:54.325 --> 31:55.617
Right.

31:56.575 --> 32:00.033
Um, I'm in a very unusual situation.

32:01.283 --> 32:04.617
There's no way to follow up that album.

32:04.700 --> 32:08.450
I had started to feel so insecure.

32:08.533 --> 32:10.450
As a comedian,

32:11.200 --> 32:13.533
I didn't know what I was saying.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.950
My album was number one on the charts,

32:18.033 --> 32:22.575
but my confidence was at an all-time low.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.700
I had to somehow make up
for what was missing now.

32:27.783 --> 32:31.700
And I didn't know
what to do or where to begin.

33:21.825 --> 33:24.867
Pass Christian is
what I consider my hometown.

33:25.992 --> 33:29.283
It's where my family is from

33:29.367 --> 33:32.867
and where I spent summer vacation.

33:32.950 --> 33:36.617
Just this is where
my brother and I both

33:36.700 --> 33:42.033
identify in that way
of it being our hometown.

33:43.242 --> 33:45.700
I think it being my mother's hometown...

33:47.200 --> 33:50.617
I can adjust to my body being different

33:50.700 --> 33:55.117
and I can adjust to eating different.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.117
That's all fine.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.408
It's just losing my mother isn't fine.

34:00.492 --> 34:03.700
I was feeling very alone.

34:03.783 --> 34:06.325
This next street,
that's my cousin's street.

34:08.242 --> 34:09.783
- Put your hat on.
- On Tig.

34:09.867 --> 34:11.117
- Tig, put your hat on.
- No.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.408
Just come on.

34:12.492 --> 34:15.199
So how are you doing
after the cancer? Like, it's gone?

34:15.283 --> 34:17.367
I mean, as far as we know.

34:17.449 --> 34:19.408
I do start treatment soon.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.574
My cancer is fed by hormones,

34:21.658 --> 34:27.158
and so I have to block my hormones
for five years.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.533
So will your voice go down more?

34:30.617 --> 34:32.658
- Maybe?
- What do you mean "more"?

34:32.742 --> 34:34.867
It may.

34:34.949 --> 34:35.949
It may.

34:36.033 --> 34:38.158
- What do you mean "more"?
- See, it would. Like that.

34:40.617 --> 34:43.867
You look like Tom Cruise
on Top Gun right now.

34:44.658 --> 34:45.658
Doesn't she?

34:45.742 --> 34:46.742
Seriously.

34:46.824 --> 34:50.283
I can't believe you've brought
another human into this situation.

34:50.367 --> 34:51.824
He's so wonderful.

34:51.908 --> 34:53.783
Look at those legs.

34:53.867 --> 34:56.492
Family's always been
important to me.

34:56.574 --> 34:59.492
I've always wanted a child and a family.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.283
Right before I was ill,

35:02.367 --> 35:06.533
I was a step away
from starting to try and have a child.

35:06.617 --> 35:09.283
Here's your hand smiley faces.

35:09.367 --> 35:10.492
Great. Thank you.

35:10.575 --> 35:12.700
See, it does look like...

35:12.783 --> 35:14.158
That is pretty.

35:16.617 --> 35:18.325
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.617
When my mother died,

35:25.492 --> 35:29.200
I switched into this mode
of not wanting kids,

35:29.283 --> 35:32.825
'cause I was thinking,
"My mother can't meet my kids."

35:32.908 --> 35:34.283
It seemed pointless.

35:34.367 --> 35:38.283
And then I was talking to my friend
that I grew up with,

35:38.367 --> 35:39.950
and she said, "Tig,

35:40.033 --> 35:43.742
just the fact that you could tell
your kids about your mother,

35:43.825 --> 35:47.075
or the fact that you could see your mother
in your kids,

35:47.158 --> 35:50.658
that's reason enough to have children."

35:53.242 --> 35:55.325
People always...
When I say I want kids,

35:55.408 --> 36:00.242
they always say, "Oh, my--
Your life is gonna totally change."

36:00.325 --> 36:02.492
And I'm like,

36:02.575 --> 36:03.825
"Yeah, I know.

36:03.908 --> 36:05.533
It's not like I haven't
thought about that."

36:05.617 --> 36:11.575
Like, "Oh, I thought I could just sleep in
and go do open mics at night.

36:11.658 --> 36:15.158
I'm gonna have to watch these things
or feed them?

36:15.242 --> 36:16.867
What do they need?"

36:17.825 --> 36:18.950
Uh...

36:19.867 --> 36:21.242
Of course my life is gonna change.

36:21.325 --> 36:23.367
That's what I want.
I want my life to change.

36:23.450 --> 36:27.742
But now, because I've had cancer,
I can't carry a child.

36:27.825 --> 36:33.908
So I have to have
a surrogate carry my child,

36:33.992 --> 36:36.658
if I can even have a kid.

36:36.742 --> 36:39.908
But even to have my eggs extracted,

36:39.992 --> 36:42.408
I have to take hormones.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.950
They think they got it all,

36:45.033 --> 36:47.658
but there could be cancerous cells in me.

36:50.325 --> 36:54.617
And if there are cancerous cells in me,
and I take the hormones,

36:54.700 --> 36:57.533
that's the gas on the fire.
It starts it up again.

37:05.450 --> 37:09.325
I was moving in the direction
of trying to have kids.

37:09.408 --> 37:10.950
Okay.

37:11.033 --> 37:14.033
And to extract the eggs,

37:14.117 --> 37:16.533
they want to do hormones.

37:17.367 --> 37:19.117
Even after a mastectomy,

37:19.200 --> 37:21.492
- breast cancer risk is not zero.
- Mmm.

37:21.575 --> 37:24.450
When it comes back
outside of the breast,

37:24.533 --> 37:27.783
it's considered not curable.

37:27.867 --> 37:32.783
Having a child may be something
to reconsider.

37:32.867 --> 37:33.867
Mmm-hmm.

37:33.950 --> 37:37.992
You know, sometimes in life
we don't always get what we want.

37:38.075 --> 37:39.908
Right.

37:53.492 --> 37:55.283
I didn't know that.

37:55.367 --> 37:57.658
I was told that my cancer could come back,

37:57.742 --> 38:02.075
that the concern would be
blood or bone or lung, or whatever,

38:02.158 --> 38:07.450
but nobody said if it comes back,
it's not treatable.

38:07.533 --> 38:09.617
That's the first I'd heard of that.

38:11.367 --> 38:12.825
That's not like,

38:12.908 --> 38:17.283
"Oh! Yeah, that meeting went well.
That feels good."

38:17.367 --> 38:21.950
Okay, so I'll just hope my cancer
doesn't come back. Great.

38:24.658 --> 38:28.533
I feel just stuck,
not knowing how to make a choice.

38:50.408 --> 38:53.533
I don't sit at a computer
and write my jokes.

38:53.617 --> 38:56.325
I write a word down

38:56.408 --> 39:01.158
and then I'll go on stage
and I work out the concept on stage.

39:02.533 --> 39:07.242
It was truly starting over.
I felt like I was a brand new comedian.

39:11.033 --> 39:12.825
You guys know
that song "Rapper's Delight"?

39:12.908 --> 39:15.200
It's a classic song,
and I was listening to it.

39:15.283 --> 39:18.992
I don't know if you realize,
that song is 15 minutes long.

39:19.075 --> 39:21.700
Holy shit, that's, like, so long.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.658
I'm performing for the first time,
doing stand-up,

39:32.742 --> 39:35.450
in six months, since my Largo set.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.825
Six months is a long time
to have not gotten on stage.

39:39.908 --> 39:42.575
If you wanna do 20 minutes,
you're welcome to.

39:42.658 --> 39:45.450
If you wanna do 30, you can too.
It really doesn't matter.

39:45.533 --> 39:47.575
If I get scared and leave,
that's fine too?

39:47.658 --> 39:49.992
Yeah. You do two, that's totally cool.

39:50.075 --> 39:51.950
What about one? What if I leave now?

39:52.033 --> 39:53.867
- Don't leave now.
- Okay.

39:55.908 --> 39:57.783
I'm gonna go back and--

39:57.867 --> 39:59.575
- But I'll introduce you.
- Okay.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.367
- Thanks, Tig.
- Yep, thank you.

40:02.408 --> 40:07.950
I was nervous 'cause nothing in my life
was funny or good for so long

40:08.033 --> 40:10.283
and I didn't feel hilarious,

40:10.367 --> 40:13.950
but I just was like,
"I have to do this."

40:14.033 --> 40:16.242
Where's the...
How do I get on the stage?

40:16.325 --> 40:18.450
There's two doors,
it's the one on the left.

40:18.533 --> 40:19.492
- It's just this door?
- Yeah.

40:19.575 --> 40:21.367
- And then I'm on stage?
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:21.450 --> 40:22.492
- Oh. Easy.
- Yeah.

40:22.575 --> 40:26.075
Please welcome right now
to the stage, Tig Notaro, everyone.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.158
Good, good, good.

40:32.242 --> 40:33.367
Um...

40:34.367 --> 40:35.658
Gosh,

40:35.742 --> 40:37.950
I don't know what to say.

40:38.033 --> 40:40.117
I had some cancer.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.533
I did, I had some cancer.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.283
Um...

40:45.367 --> 40:47.117
I, uh...

40:47.200 --> 40:53.533
I've made a lot of jokes over the years
about how flat-chested I was.

40:53.617 --> 40:56.783
And I had breast cancer,
and I often think, you know,

40:56.867 --> 40:58.367
"Did they overhear...

41:00.492 --> 41:02.492
all of the joking?"

41:02.575 --> 41:06.075
And were just like, "You know what?
She does not appreciate us."

41:08.283 --> 41:10.783
"Do you hear her?
She's doing it again.

41:10.867 --> 41:14.117
Yeah, now we're in Kansas City
and now she's telling them.

41:16.325 --> 41:21.617
We've been flying all over this country
and she's just being so rough on us.

41:22.742 --> 41:26.033
You know what? Let's get out of here."

41:26.908 --> 41:29.575
I had to just go
through the motions and...

41:29.658 --> 41:33.242
It was so embarrassing
when I would stop into a club

41:33.325 --> 41:35.408
and wanna get on stage,

41:35.492 --> 41:39.658
and after all of the press of my album,

41:39.742 --> 41:42.033
people would introduce me and say,

41:42.117 --> 41:47.283
"Boy do we have
a special treat for you tonight."

41:47.367 --> 41:52.658
And I was like, "No! No!
I have no material," you know.

41:52.742 --> 41:55.575
"One of the best comics out there."

41:55.658 --> 41:58.575
No. I don't have--

41:58.658 --> 42:04.117
I'm just trying to walk on stage again
and hold a microphone.

42:09.033 --> 42:10.825
Oh, gosh.

42:10.908 --> 42:12.408
Ladies and gentlemen,
here tonight,

42:12.492 --> 42:14.658
once again we have, Tig Notaro is here.

42:28.533 --> 42:30.283
I'm really nervous right now.

42:33.617 --> 42:38.450
I feel like I am going to, uh...
just wrap up now.

42:42.033 --> 42:44.700
Thank you so much.
You guys are such a great audience.

42:51.283 --> 42:54.867
I was walking in, um... New York.

42:55.867 --> 42:57.700
I'll work this out on my own time.

43:00.200 --> 43:03.700
This is my own time.
This is my time.

43:03.783 --> 43:05.450
I'm on fire right now.

43:13.617 --> 43:15.867
I'm trying to make things right.

43:17.158 --> 43:18.450
So...

43:19.533 --> 43:22.450
You guys seem to really laugh
at the cancer stuff.

43:30.158 --> 43:33.825
The material, it's barely there.

43:33.908 --> 43:38.617
So I'm basically showing up and, uh...
scrambling.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.450
It's embarrassing.

43:41.533 --> 43:46.908
I struggled a week ago on stage
like I hadn't in years.

43:46.992 --> 43:51.450
And what it did do
was put a fire under me,

43:51.533 --> 43:53.742
'cause I was like, "I'm horrible.

43:53.825 --> 43:58.033
I'm horrible at what I do these days,
so I need to work on this."

44:33.200 --> 44:36.658
Patient risk of infection,
hemorrhage, drug reaction,

44:36.742 --> 44:39.200
anesthesia reaction,
blood vessel inflammation.

44:39.283 --> 44:40.825
And then initial at the bottom.

44:40.908 --> 44:44.200
Injury to other organs,
neurological reaction, other risks.

44:45.325 --> 44:48.908
It's such a weird feeling
to be reading something that's like,

44:48.992 --> 44:52.158
"This could happen, including death."

44:52.242 --> 44:54.242
And you're like, "Okay."

44:54.325 --> 44:55.825
No problem.

44:55.908 --> 44:57.367
Whatever it takes.

44:58.325 --> 44:59.408
Out we go.

44:59.492 --> 45:01.075
I want to be cremated.

45:01.158 --> 45:03.283
Get your will in place.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.408
Tig, stop it.

45:04.492 --> 45:06.117
It does not say that.

45:06.200 --> 45:08.617
- How painful is this?
- Not too bad.

45:08.700 --> 45:11.742
It's in.

45:11.825 --> 45:15.075
What, am I gonna back out
and not do this?

45:17.658 --> 45:20.033
I would live with regret.

45:20.992 --> 45:23.283
You either live with regret or you die.

45:23.367 --> 45:25.783
What are you gonna choose?
You're gonna choose death.

45:25.867 --> 45:28.450
Fun way to start your day.

45:29.658 --> 45:30.617
Keep going.

45:30.700 --> 45:32.825
Go in fast?

45:32.908 --> 45:35.575
You can do it.
Not too fast but...

45:35.658 --> 45:37.825
- How far in?
- All the way in.

45:37.908 --> 45:38.908
Ugh.

45:39.575 --> 45:41.200
Oh, God, this is horrible.

45:41.283 --> 45:44.283
I don't know if I can do this.

45:44.367 --> 45:47.658
All the way in.
There you go.

45:47.742 --> 45:49.408
Push.

45:51.117 --> 45:52.950
All the medication in.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.492
Ow!

45:58.367 --> 46:00.325
Had some emotional days.

46:01.242 --> 46:05.408
I was in the hotel room
in Saint Paul and, uh...

46:07.200 --> 46:11.742
I had what I thought
was the funniest, saddest moment,

46:11.825 --> 46:15.825
'cause I was alone
in a hotel room in Saint Paul,

46:15.908 --> 46:20.158
injecting my stomach
with fertility drugs.

46:20.242 --> 46:22.658
And in my brain...

46:22.742 --> 46:26.617
this voice went, "You know
you're single when..."

46:26.700 --> 46:29.408
You know, there I was,
alone in Saint Paul,

46:29.492 --> 46:32.367
injecting myself,
hoping to have children.

46:32.450 --> 46:34.867
Like, wanting to,
like, build a family,

46:34.950 --> 46:38.200
but the hormones
making me emotional

46:38.283 --> 46:40.950
to where I wanted
to throw myself out of a window.

46:41.033 --> 46:43.408
So, it was such a funny cycle that,

46:43.492 --> 46:48.992
"God, what if I killed myself
in the process of trying to have a child?"

46:51.325 --> 46:53.242
You're doing awesome.

46:53.325 --> 46:54.950
What that means is,

46:55.033 --> 46:57.200
basically you've done
eight days of shots.

46:57.283 --> 46:58.283
Mmm-hmm.

46:58.367 --> 47:00.325
You're supposed to have
16 to 20 millimeter follicles

47:00.408 --> 47:05.117
and you have
20, 20, 19, 17, 17, 17, 19, 19, 19.

47:05.200 --> 47:08.450
Now this is...

47:08.533 --> 47:12.158
what a 30-some-odd-year-old person does.

47:12.242 --> 47:13.617
Thirty what?

47:13.700 --> 47:15.700
- Oh, now you wanna know how of 30?
- Okay.

47:15.783 --> 47:18.283
Yeah, so, like, you know,
35 or younger.

47:18.367 --> 47:20.158
- That's really good. I mean...
- Great.

47:20.242 --> 47:24.450
Just, apparently, either you're
not sure about your date of birth,

47:24.533 --> 47:26.075
or your ovaries didn't get the memo.

47:26.158 --> 47:28.242
On Wednesday, we do the procedure.

47:28.325 --> 47:31.825
We need sperm that morning,
and then that's it.

47:31.908 --> 47:34.283
We're gonna tell you
how many fertilized the next day,

47:34.367 --> 47:36.283
how many are dividing the day after,

47:36.367 --> 47:38.408
and then we're gonna decide
how many we're gonna freeze

47:38.492 --> 47:40.075
on day three or day five.

47:40.158 --> 47:41.533
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

47:41.617 --> 47:45.367
I decided to choose my friend Paris
to be the donor.

47:45.450 --> 47:47.783
I had a crush on him
when I was a kid.

47:47.867 --> 47:52.283
And my mother always wished
I would be with or end up with him.

47:52.367 --> 47:54.533
Until I started
bringing girlfriends around.

47:55.200 --> 47:58.283
What a funny route.

47:58.367 --> 48:00.283
It's all my mother ever wanted.

48:00.367 --> 48:02.450
Thank you.

48:02.533 --> 48:05.408
Is that your specimen?

48:10.408 --> 48:12.867
We have about six excellent eggs,

48:12.950 --> 48:15.825
nine good eggs,
and one poor.

48:15.908 --> 48:17.283
- So that's good.
- Nice.

48:17.367 --> 48:18.450
- All right.
- All right.

48:18.533 --> 48:20.367
- That's great. Yeah.
- That's awesome, isn't it?

48:20.450 --> 48:23.533
Tomorrow I'll call you
and tell you how many fertilized.

49:01.075 --> 49:06.533
I'm getting iron via IV.

49:06.617 --> 49:08.408
Via IV.

49:09.658 --> 49:15.075
I've had extremely low iron.

49:15.950 --> 49:22.117
My oncologist attributes it to
all the hospitalization and surgery and...

49:22.200 --> 49:24.367
everything I've been through.

49:31.242 --> 49:34.533
I ran into this girl
that I had worked with

49:34.617 --> 49:36.658
and then, um...

49:38.700 --> 49:40.617
we, uh...

49:42.325 --> 49:44.617
started hanging out.

49:45.242 --> 49:48.325
I met Stephanie on In a World.

49:48.408 --> 49:52.325
She was my love interest
in the movie.

49:52.408 --> 49:53.742
You should cut your hair.

49:53.825 --> 49:57.617
Stop trying to woo me by being mean.
Doesn't work.

49:57.700 --> 50:00.158
- You wanna get a drink later?
- Okay.

50:00.242 --> 50:02.658
I've been acting since I was 18.

50:02.742 --> 50:06.325
I moved to Los Angeles
after I dropped out of high school.

50:06.408 --> 50:08.783
Tell me about that.

50:08.867 --> 50:10.742
I had a 4.1 GPA

50:10.825 --> 50:14.908
and I dropped out my senior year
with a semester to go.

50:14.992 --> 50:18.450
Very much like, "No, this is what
I wanna do, and I'm gonna do it.

50:18.533 --> 50:21.117
And I'll let everything fall into place."

50:22.200 --> 50:26.283
The next time I saw Stephanie
was almost a year later.

50:26.367 --> 50:28.283
In a World was going to Sundance.

50:28.367 --> 50:30.950
Tig was sitting behind me
at the premiere,

50:31.033 --> 50:35.283
and any time she came onscreen
she'd lean forward and go,

50:35.367 --> 50:38.950
"I had cancer and I didn't know it.
I have cancer right there."

50:39.033 --> 50:43.700
When I gave her my number,
I said, "Don't text me too much."

50:43.783 --> 50:45.950
I said, "I just went out with this girl

50:46.033 --> 50:49.367
that wouldn't stop texting me
after just having coffee one day."

50:50.450 --> 50:54.242
That girl texted me "sweet dreams"
before bed, and I was like, "Oh..."

50:54.325 --> 50:57.408
Just seemed like
a bit much after the one coffee.

50:57.492 --> 51:01.033
So, I told Stephanie,
"If you're an excessive texter,

51:01.117 --> 51:02.908
please leave me out of it."

51:04.367 --> 51:07.450
When I went home,
I got a text that just said...

51:07.533 --> 51:09.408
That just said, "Sweet dreams,"

51:09.492 --> 51:11.283
and it made me laugh so hard.

51:11.367 --> 51:15.283
We started this bit almost of...

51:15.367 --> 51:17.242
"Ugh, traffic!"

51:17.325 --> 51:20.283
She would text me something
like that, or just something very...

51:20.367 --> 51:21.867
Just daily minutia.

51:24.867 --> 51:27.992
And then we started
texting all the time.

51:34.992 --> 51:38.450
I was waiting for this
stupid back and forth--

51:38.533 --> 51:40.773
It seemed like she had a team
of writers writing for her.

51:40.783 --> 51:41.867
She was so funny.

51:49.408 --> 51:53.783
We were texting
for hours on end every day.

51:53.867 --> 51:58.700
I was becoming the person
that I didn't understand before.

52:08.283 --> 52:10.658
I thought Stephanie was so hilarious

52:10.742 --> 52:14.617
that I wanted to incorporate her
in whatever I was doing.

52:14.700 --> 52:16.492
I went through a lot last year,

52:16.575 --> 52:20.408
and yeah, not to be
totally intense, heavy, serious,

52:20.492 --> 52:24.492
but, you know, I learned
that it's important to, uh...

52:24.575 --> 52:27.408
to be present and live your life.

52:28.492 --> 52:30.575
Sorry. My phone.

52:30.658 --> 52:32.783
I forgot to turn my phone off.

52:34.325 --> 52:36.950
What you're saying is you went
through this intense experience.

52:37.033 --> 52:38.033
Right.

52:38.117 --> 52:40.867
And it taught you that,
you know, you need to...

52:40.950 --> 52:42.492
- To just--
- You get one life and you need to...

52:42.575 --> 52:46.867
Yeah, just, you know,
love the people you're with

52:46.950 --> 52:50.492
and enjoy your life, and just to be...

52:50.575 --> 52:51.825
I'm sorry.

52:51.908 --> 52:54.117
Just to be present. Uh...

53:05.700 --> 53:10.908
I'm sorry. My friend sends me
the funniest cat pictures.

53:13.117 --> 53:16.533
You went through a...
a harrowing experience...

53:17.908 --> 53:18.908
- I--
- ...where you thought

53:18.992 --> 53:20.450
maybe your life is threatened.

53:20.533 --> 53:22.408
- No, my life was threatened.
- Yeah.

53:22.492 --> 53:25.742
Do you mind, I, uh...
I want... I...

53:25.825 --> 53:28.742
She has this really funny picture.
Do you mind if I call her?

53:29.533 --> 53:32.033
Go ahead. That's fine.

53:36.742 --> 53:38.658
- Hello?
- Hey.

53:40.033 --> 53:41.033
Hey!

53:41.117 --> 53:42.533
Hey, what are you doing?

53:43.367 --> 53:44.617
Uh...

53:44.700 --> 53:47.367
Nothing, just...
What are you doing?

53:47.450 --> 53:49.117
Nothing.

53:55.658 --> 53:58.867
We didn't plan
that Conan segment out at all.

53:58.950 --> 54:00.158
I remember her going,

54:00.242 --> 54:04.033
"Just, when I call you, answer,
and just be really boring."

54:05.033 --> 54:07.367
So then I heard
the audience laughing,

54:07.450 --> 54:10.367
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
Tig is the funniest person I've ever met."

54:11.158 --> 54:14.617
I couldn't tell exactly
how I felt or how she felt.

54:14.700 --> 54:17.950
I just knew I really looked forward
to hearing from her.

54:18.575 --> 54:21.658
And she made me laugh so hard, so...

54:21.742 --> 54:24.075
it started to creep in my head, like,

54:24.158 --> 54:28.200
"Do I like this person
more than a friend?"

54:29.117 --> 54:31.825
I had stolen the kitten.

54:31.908 --> 54:34.908
I felt like Tig was interested in me,

54:34.992 --> 54:38.867
but I had told her
that I was only interested in men.

54:39.575 --> 54:41.492
It was very clear

54:41.575 --> 54:43.295
and we'd talk about it
and then it was done,

54:43.367 --> 54:46.367
and then we'd just talk
about something else.

54:49.450 --> 54:52.825
Now, fellas,
we should get into the show.

54:52.908 --> 54:54.617
Michelle, you're on to talk
about pregnancy, right?

54:54.700 --> 54:57.117
Yes. Yes, I'm an expert
in the area of being pregnant.

54:57.200 --> 54:59.825
I'm 42. I had cancer,

54:59.908 --> 55:03.242
and I was told I couldn't carry
a child for five years.

55:03.325 --> 55:06.492
So if there's somebody out there
that wants to carry a baby for me,

55:07.283 --> 55:09.325
please get in touch with Aaron
and let me know.

55:09.408 --> 55:12.617
The phones are ringing off the hook!

55:34.658 --> 55:39.117
These people wrote in
and their e-mail seemed totally normal.

55:39.200 --> 55:42.075
You know, I had Aaron,
my assistant, e-mail with them,

55:42.158 --> 55:44.908
and they still seemed normal.

55:44.992 --> 55:49.117
I might Skype with them,
and be like, "Oh, my Lord. Bye-bye."

55:51.367 --> 55:54.075
This is so awkward.

55:54.158 --> 55:56.700
"Hi, will you carry my child?"

55:56.783 --> 55:58.825
Hello.

55:59.908 --> 56:01.450
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

56:01.533 --> 56:03.283
I don't know where to begin.

56:03.367 --> 56:05.158
- I mean, this is just so bizarre.
- Yeah.

56:05.242 --> 56:06.242
But, um...

56:06.325 --> 56:09.075
Like I said in my initial e-mail,
I was, kind of, you know...

56:09.158 --> 56:10.533
We're glad to do all this,

56:10.617 --> 56:14.450
but we're both also curious
how you would wanna see it go,

56:14.533 --> 56:16.617
I mean, in terms of
the weirdness of the fact

56:16.700 --> 56:18.283
we're states apart and stuff.

56:18.367 --> 56:19.492
Your dream scenario,

56:19.575 --> 56:21.158
- what would you love?
- Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

56:21.242 --> 56:24.200
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, I'm kinda just really open.

56:24.867 --> 56:28.700
After this crazy year that I had,

56:28.783 --> 56:32.867
one of the really positive things
that came from it is

56:32.950 --> 56:37.617
being more open to people
than I've ever been.

56:37.700 --> 56:44.575
And people have shown just
such generosity and love and kindness

56:44.658 --> 56:47.742
in a way that it's just,
my head is exploding.

56:47.825 --> 56:52.033
And I... This is not something
I would've done a year ago.

56:52.117 --> 56:55.242
I was so much more closed off.

56:55.325 --> 56:56.950
So...

56:57.033 --> 56:59.617
I'll come up for the weekend and...

56:59.700 --> 57:04.242
- and get to know you guys a little better.
- Sure. Sounds like a plan.

57:04.325 --> 57:07.117
Awesome. Well, thanks...
thanks so much.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.742
And I look forward to meeting y'all.

57:08.825 --> 57:09.867
- Thank you.
- All right.

57:09.950 --> 57:11.117
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

57:11.200 --> 57:12.658
See you in Seattle.

57:12.742 --> 57:15.033
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Okay, bye.

57:16.200 --> 57:20.033
Oh, my God.
What am I doing?

57:29.033 --> 57:31.408
Just dropping by to see an old friend.

57:31.492 --> 57:33.117
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

57:33.200 --> 57:35.117
- How are you?
- Hello!

57:35.200 --> 57:37.117
- This is Harpo.
- Harpo!

57:37.200 --> 57:38.950
You're tiny and cute.

57:39.867 --> 57:40.867
Harpo.

57:40.950 --> 57:42.742
He's just kinda waking up,
so he's like, "Blah!"

57:42.825 --> 57:44.492
Hi!

57:44.575 --> 57:47.408
We're friends. Yeah.

57:48.658 --> 57:50.283
Oh!

57:51.242 --> 57:53.367
You're very cute.

57:58.033 --> 58:00.242
I know, I need a haircut.

58:05.658 --> 58:06.617
- Hey.
- Hi.

58:06.700 --> 58:09.033
He's home.
Told you he wouldn't be long.

58:09.992 --> 58:11.908
Do you know that guy?

58:11.992 --> 58:15.117
Amanda has talked in the past
about providing surrogacy

58:15.200 --> 58:17.992
for her sister,
for a best friend,

58:18.075 --> 58:20.075
and those didn't need to happen,
it turned out.

58:20.158 --> 58:21.158
So it never really happened.

58:21.242 --> 58:23.802
But I thought, you know,
Amanda's talked about doing this before.

58:23.867 --> 58:26.950
Maybe this could...
Maybe this would work out somehow.

58:27.033 --> 58:29.325
You wanna go back and forth,
have a question off?

58:29.408 --> 58:30.408
Sure.

58:30.492 --> 58:32.908
Do either of you have a criminal record?

58:32.992 --> 58:35.200
- No.
- Nope.

58:35.283 --> 58:37.617
- Does Harpo?
- Not yet.

58:37.700 --> 58:40.075
The father...
Should I be treating you as a couple,

58:40.158 --> 58:43.117
or should I be treating you
as an individual?

58:43.200 --> 58:44.575
- As an individual.
- Okay.

58:44.658 --> 58:47.617
But I mean, he's also
one of my closest, oldest friends.

58:47.700 --> 58:49.783
Yeah. I would just think,
for your own sanity,

58:49.867 --> 58:51.783
you're gonna want to
have people around.

58:51.867 --> 58:54.283
That looks fun, Harpo.

58:55.325 --> 58:57.867
Oh, I ruined it.

58:58.617 --> 59:00.575
Will you be doing, like, a will?

59:00.658 --> 59:02.450
Like, a revised one
for the potential child?

59:02.533 --> 59:04.325
'Cause if something
happened to you, God forbid,

59:04.408 --> 59:06.575
while I was pregnant,

59:06.658 --> 59:09.825
it would be nice to know
kinda what the game plan,

59:09.908 --> 59:13.533
- or who to talk to about the situation.
- Mmm-hmm.

59:13.617 --> 59:14.700
I have not done that,

59:15.325 --> 59:17.492
but I'm trying to go about this

59:18.408 --> 59:19.867
in a...

59:21.825 --> 59:24.450
reasonable...

59:24.533 --> 59:26.742
as reasonable and thorough as you can,

59:26.825 --> 59:29.283
- getting a surrogate through a podcast.
- Yeah.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.867
Here you go.

59:40.367 --> 59:41.950
What an interesting door.

59:43.408 --> 59:45.825
Ah, I see.
One of those.

59:45.908 --> 59:48.033
- Hey! Hi, Harpo.
- How's it going?

59:48.117 --> 59:49.992
He's all stinky-bottom.

59:50.075 --> 59:51.658
Yeah. I know.

59:51.742 --> 59:55.283
Harpo, you should've used a toilet.

59:58.242 --> 01:00:00.158
What were you thinking?

01:00:00.242 --> 01:00:02.575
Harpo, what do you think of L.A.?

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:04.573
I'm gonna go hold her hand

01:00:04.575 --> 01:00:06.075
if you feel like watching
a little baby for a while.

01:00:06.158 --> 01:00:07.658
- Absolutely.
- Everything he needs is in there.

01:00:07.742 --> 01:00:09.283
Enjoy.

01:00:09.367 --> 01:00:10.450
Nice, dear.

01:00:10.533 --> 01:00:13.450
Harpo! Let's hang.

01:00:13.533 --> 01:00:15.950
- Have fun, buddy.
- Hi!

01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:18.533
Hi!

01:00:18.617 --> 01:00:21.950
You're so easygoing,
it's ridiculous.

01:00:22.033 --> 01:00:25.283
What baby just gets handed off
to essentially a stranger

01:00:25.367 --> 01:00:28.825
and just starts
laughing and smiling?

01:00:28.908 --> 01:00:30.700
Harpo. That's who.

01:00:34.617 --> 01:00:37.575
This is an interesting technique.

01:00:38.825 --> 01:00:40.742
That is not how I read magazines,

01:00:40.825 --> 01:00:43.450
but you know, I'm...
I'm not here to judge.

01:00:43.533 --> 01:00:44.533
Okay.

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:47.200
- Her uterus looks very normal.
- Okay.

01:00:47.283 --> 01:00:51.200
And the uterine cavity
basically has no lesions in it

01:00:51.283 --> 01:00:52.617
and it looks great.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.492
- Okay. Uh-huh.
- Gorgeous.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.867
No, just the black team.

01:01:07.033 --> 01:01:11.158
Stephanie had been
hanging out very casually.

01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:17.492
We had almost six months
of going to dinner, hanging out, bowling,

01:01:17.575 --> 01:01:22.075
and I reached a point
where I realized I wanted to be with her.

01:01:32.908 --> 01:01:36.700
It started to grow into this thing
of not just being into her,

01:01:36.783 --> 01:01:39.033
but somebody
where there was potential

01:01:39.117 --> 01:01:45.117
and somebody that I felt like
I could really get serious about.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.450
It was hard to stay
as casual as we were.

01:01:52.783 --> 01:01:55.992
We were texting, we were
having dinner, we were hanging out.

01:01:56.075 --> 01:01:57.555
We'd stay till the restaurant closed.

01:01:57.575 --> 01:01:59.783
We'd talk in our car
until the sun came up.

01:01:59.867 --> 01:02:04.742
But it was such a mystery to me
with it being a woman that I couldn't...

01:02:04.825 --> 01:02:07.200
If it was a guy, I'd be like,
"Of course we were dating."

01:02:07.283 --> 01:02:09.450
But in my mind, I...

01:02:09.533 --> 01:02:12.325
Every time I'd see her,
I was like, "What am I doing?"

01:02:12.408 --> 01:02:15.575
Like, I couldn't figure it out.

01:02:15.658 --> 01:02:19.783
And then, she was being interviewed
by the GRAMMYs Association.

01:02:19.867 --> 01:02:22.117
I went to it,
and I remember that night going,

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.783
"I feel like I'm on a date with her."

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.742
You know, a lot of people have asked
if it bummed me out that...

01:02:29.825 --> 01:02:32.742
You know, they're like,
"Oh, I've been a fan of yours for years,"

01:02:32.825 --> 01:02:35.950
and, you know, "I can't believe
it took cancer to..." you know.

01:02:36.033 --> 01:02:40.408
And for a little while,
I think I was like, "Yeah!"

01:02:40.492 --> 01:02:43.075
You know.

01:02:43.158 --> 01:02:45.825
But then I thought about it,

01:02:45.908 --> 01:02:50.575
and it's not cancer
that brought the attention.

01:02:50.658 --> 01:02:52.533
It was... I was doing stand-up.

01:02:52.617 --> 01:02:54.283
- And that's what I do.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:54.367 --> 01:02:55.825
So I'm...

01:02:55.908 --> 01:02:59.367
I'm okay with how I reached where I am.

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:01.117
Tig Notaro.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.742
Thank you.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:08.783
But this is something
they do all the time?

01:03:08.867 --> 01:03:10.283
Yeah, with, like, Stevie Nicks

01:03:10.367 --> 01:03:12.742
- and people like that.
- Oh, cool.

01:03:12.825 --> 01:03:15.033
But not, like, people like me.

01:03:15.117 --> 01:03:18.283
I wasn't comfortable hearing my album.

01:03:18.367 --> 01:03:19.783
- Really?
- Oh, it makes me so uncomfortable.

01:03:19.867 --> 01:03:22.283
- And you've only listened to it once?
- Mmm.

01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:25.367
It's fun to see you listen to it.

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:26.450
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:26.533 --> 01:03:28.617
Could you tell I was uncomfortable?

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.242
- No?
- No.

01:03:30.325 --> 01:03:32.783
- But you don't know me well.
- Not that you were like...

01:03:32.867 --> 01:03:35.158
Not that you were like,
"Yeah! Turn it up!"

01:03:35.242 --> 01:03:37.783
- "Turn it up. I love this part. Shh!"
- "This part."

01:03:37.867 --> 01:03:40.450
- "Ah, yeah! Cancer."
- "Every time."

01:03:40.533 --> 01:03:43.492
"I get cancer every time right here."

01:03:46.033 --> 01:03:49.950
I had no plans to talk to her
about our relationship,

01:03:50.033 --> 01:03:53.575
but by the end of the night,
I think just hanging out with her,

01:03:53.658 --> 01:03:55.492
it really came over me.

01:03:55.575 --> 01:03:58.158
I wanna commit to this person...

01:03:58.242 --> 01:03:59.700
and...

01:04:01.117 --> 01:04:05.117
I felt like if that wasn't gonna happen,
I needed to step away.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.117
That night, she said,
"I can't do this anymore."

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.825
And I immediately just said,
"Okay, fine."

01:04:11.908 --> 01:04:15.200
Because I was like,
"What am I doing to this person?"

01:04:15.283 --> 01:04:16.325
And, "This isn't fair."

01:04:16.408 --> 01:04:19.283
And, "She's so clear
on how she feels, and in her life,

01:04:19.367 --> 01:04:20.783
and it's... it's nothing."

01:04:20.867 --> 01:04:23.158
And here I'm gonna be like,
"Well, I just... Can I try?

01:04:23.242 --> 01:04:24.825
And I don't know how...
if it's gonna be right.

01:04:24.908 --> 01:04:28.367
And it's just gonna be,
like, a waste of time."

01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:30.992
So we, sort of, ended it.

01:04:31.992 --> 01:04:34.658
I was so sad.

01:04:54.242 --> 01:04:57.325
Give it up for Ms. Tig Notaro.

01:05:21.033 --> 01:05:23.533
It's Tig Notaro!

01:05:51.742 --> 01:05:55.283
I have a joke about
my boobs overhearing

01:05:55.367 --> 01:05:57.492
all of my
"oh, them little titty" jokes,

01:05:57.575 --> 01:05:58.908
- and being like...
- Uh-huh.

01:05:59.867 --> 01:06:03.117
"She doesn't even appreciate us.
Let's just get out of here."

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.200
That was funny.

01:06:05.283 --> 01:06:08.283
I feel like I did that one night,
and people were like...

01:06:08.367 --> 01:06:09.825
Oh!

01:06:09.908 --> 01:06:13.783
But I think,
maybe I didn't have the confidence.

01:06:13.867 --> 01:06:16.867
If you can pull it off
and make them feel comfortable,

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:18.575
I think that'd be a winner.

01:06:18.658 --> 01:06:21.908
Oh, my God,
here's an idea that I had.

01:06:21.992 --> 01:06:24.033
- This is dumb!
- Oh!

01:06:24.117 --> 01:06:25.492
I know.

01:06:27.033 --> 01:06:32.283
This is a headline from The Onion
that made me laugh so hard.

01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:33.950
What is that?

01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:39.200
"Seagull with diarrhea

01:06:39.283 --> 01:06:43.117
barely makes it...

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.450
barely makes it
to crowded beach in time."

01:06:54.492 --> 01:06:57.408
- Oh, my God.
- I would...

01:06:57.492 --> 01:06:59.867
I would wake up...

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:03.867
and think about that
and just start laughing.

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:05.617
- That is so funny.
- So...

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:09.992
I'm wanting to write a bit about
your brain, like, can't move on.

01:07:10.075 --> 01:07:11.450
Like, everyone's moved on.

01:07:11.533 --> 01:07:13.773
'Cause there are people
that move on from that just fine.

01:07:13.825 --> 01:07:16.033
- Right.
- I can't move on.

01:07:16.117 --> 01:07:18.617
That is really funny.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.950
And then I'll go into diarrhea.

01:07:21.033 --> 01:07:23.242
And then I'll go into--

01:07:25.658 --> 01:07:26.867
I...

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.950
have spent years

01:07:30.033 --> 01:07:33.533
making fun of how flat-chested I am.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.533
And then...

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:39.617
I got bilateral breast cancer.

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.033
Thank you.
Good night.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.742
Whoo!

01:07:49.575 --> 01:07:51.617
Whoo! Cancer!

01:07:52.617 --> 01:07:55.117
Um... Yeah, it just seems like,

01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:00.033
probably my chest was overhearing
all the jokes over the years,

01:08:00.117 --> 01:08:03.658
and they were just like,
"You know what, let's get out of here."

01:08:10.242 --> 01:08:11.992
I'm gonna go work on some new material.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.950
The good news is, nice new rack.

01:08:20.408 --> 01:08:26.867
I've been working tirelessly
on building a new hour of material.

01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:30.367
I did this live Professor Blastoff tour.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:33.908
Welcome.

01:08:33.992 --> 01:08:38.367
It just was helping
ease back into live performance.

01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:41.450
Everything was fun
and there was no pressure.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:43.325
Go!

01:08:52.075 --> 01:08:54.658
She-- Look at her!
That's how she's been the whole night.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.533
Then it picks up momentum.

01:08:57.617 --> 01:08:58.908
I love this.

01:08:59.867 --> 01:09:01.533
Love when there's a snort.

01:09:01.617 --> 01:09:03.533
It's old muscles that get worked out.

01:09:03.617 --> 01:09:07.200
- That wasn't me.
- Nobody said it was you.

01:09:14.867 --> 01:09:16.908
Can you come here?

01:09:16.992 --> 01:09:19.283
What do you mean, "No"?

01:09:19.367 --> 01:09:22.950
And you're like,
"Oh, yeah, this is what I do.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:24.783
This is completely my thing."

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.158
Two minutes!

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.617
I felt like I had accomplished something.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.617
But I still have no idea
if I'm ready to do this anniversary show.

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:47.367
Please welcome
Tig Notaro, everybody!

01:09:56.867 --> 01:09:59.242
Stephanie and I didn't
talk for weeks.

01:10:01.367 --> 01:10:03.408
When she said this is done,

01:10:03.492 --> 01:10:07.325
I went into this zone
where I was so sad.

01:10:07.408 --> 01:10:09.450
Then it sunk in, really.

01:10:09.533 --> 01:10:14.158
I was, like, I don't know
how to go forward in my life without...

01:10:14.242 --> 01:10:15.283
this person.

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:18.242
She called me

01:10:18.325 --> 01:10:22.200
and said she'd like to come over
and talk to me about things.

01:10:23.158 --> 01:10:26.283
I knew if I don't say yes
to this in my life,

01:10:26.367 --> 01:10:29.783
then I am not following
my feelings and my heart.

01:10:29.867 --> 01:10:34.283
She just sat down next to me
on the couch and just said...

01:10:34.367 --> 01:10:39.492
"I've missed you and just been miserable."

01:10:39.575 --> 01:10:44.783
I said, "I... I have feelings for you.
I would really love to try this."

01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:48.158
And then, from that night until now,

01:10:48.242 --> 01:10:50.158
truly, have been inseparable.

01:10:54.867 --> 01:10:57.867
We were just together after that.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.825
With Tig, my love is, like,

01:11:02.908 --> 01:11:06.617
it spills out of me and
I just feel like I'm always smiling.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.867
I wish it was.

01:11:10.242 --> 01:11:11.242
On the red carpet.

01:11:11.325 --> 01:11:12.950
I loved meeting her family.

01:11:13.033 --> 01:11:17.367
And they're all very extroverted,
welcoming people.

01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:19.970
It's like, "Oh, Tig likes you?
Well, then you're in the family."

01:11:21.867 --> 01:11:24.408
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:11:25.367 --> 01:11:29.367
I've been in love before,
and I have dated so many people.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:32.200
But I have not been in love
like this before.

01:11:44.908 --> 01:11:47.408
I got great news the other day

01:11:47.492 --> 01:11:52.325
that I had nine embryos
that thawed and all lived.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:55.950
But then I got
not great news yesterday

01:11:56.033 --> 01:11:58.367
that only one is viable.

01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:01.658
So that was a rough day, yesterday.

01:12:01.742 --> 01:12:03.658
But...

01:12:03.742 --> 01:12:08.950
I feel very excited
and very positive about it.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:12.617
We have one shot one time.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:17.700
Yeah, I wanna stay positive
and I want this to happen.

01:12:18.492 --> 01:12:20.158
Harpo.

01:12:22.992 --> 01:12:26.367
I knew she was having a baby
when we started dating,

01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:30.033
but I didn't want to presume
that it was ours.

01:12:30.117 --> 01:12:33.742
And I don't think
she wanted to put that on me,

01:12:33.825 --> 01:12:35.325
like, "Okay, well,
if you're gonna date me,

01:12:35.408 --> 01:12:37.450
well, you're also gonna be a mother."

01:12:37.533 --> 01:12:39.783
Oh!

01:12:39.867 --> 01:12:41.117
I would keep it away from her,

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.117
and then I remember one day,
there was some meeting or call,

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.617
or something that came up,

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:50.450
and then she said, "Wait,
why didn't you tell me about that?"

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:55.158
And I said, "Well, you know, I just don't
wanna scare you or make you nervous."

01:12:55.242 --> 01:12:57.908
And she was like,
"Are you out of your mind?"

01:12:57.992 --> 01:13:01.908
She said, "I'm excited about this.
I wanna be a part of this."

01:13:01.992 --> 01:13:06.492
Stephanie and I
would like to have five kids.

01:13:06.575 --> 01:13:08.533
It was her idea.
But I'm on board.

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:10.075
There'd be fifty toes.

01:13:10.158 --> 01:13:13.075
- That's a lot of toes to clip.
- That's a lot of toes.

01:13:13.158 --> 01:13:14.242
Yeah.

01:13:14.325 --> 01:13:16.045
Do you have a minute
so I can talk with you?

01:13:16.117 --> 01:13:18.283
- Totally have a minute.
- Come on in.

01:13:18.367 --> 01:13:19.533
This way.

01:13:22.825 --> 01:13:26.783
- This is the embryo that is normal.
- Okay.

01:13:26.867 --> 01:13:30.992
It has made it to the blastocyst stage
and it's hatching.

01:13:31.075 --> 01:13:33.700
And is that what
we have this explosion for?

01:13:33.783 --> 01:13:34.867
- Yes.
- Yes!

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:37.617
So you now have hatching.
So that is awesome.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.242
By the way, are you okay

01:13:39.325 --> 01:13:41.450
- with knowing the sex of the...
- Yeah.

01:13:41.533 --> 01:13:42.908
It's gonna be a boy.

01:13:43.575 --> 01:13:46.200
So now it's time for us
to basically put him in.

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.950
Is there any way
to put in a request

01:13:49.033 --> 01:13:51.908
that you try even harder
than you've ever tried?

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:53.242
Try hard.

01:13:53.325 --> 01:13:56.617
Okay, now I got
the catheter in my hand.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.908
Now, the embryo is right here.

01:13:58.992 --> 01:14:02.117
I'm gonna put it in
and then slide it out. Okay?

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.742
Come on, Jack.

01:14:05.033 --> 01:14:07.658
What, you named it already?

01:14:08.575 --> 01:14:11.117
- Yeah?
- In trying to stay positive.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.242
- I love it. Jack.
- Jack Notaro.

01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:17.117
Okay, Jack is going in.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.950
Come on, Jack.

01:14:19.033 --> 01:14:23.742
Okay, I need the top.
Keep it picture. I'm going in.

01:14:23.825 --> 01:14:25.908
- Oh, wow.
- I am right there.

01:14:27.033 --> 01:14:28.617
This is the moment.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.283
How are you doing, Amanda?

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:33.575
Good.

01:14:33.658 --> 01:14:35.033
And I'm done.

01:14:35.617 --> 01:14:37.658
And there is...

01:14:38.617 --> 01:14:40.033
- Jack.
- Jack.

01:14:43.325 --> 01:14:45.492
And this is the picture of the ultrasound.

01:14:46.158 --> 01:14:48.742
- I felt emotional when that went in.
- Yeah?

01:14:48.825 --> 01:14:52.075
I got... I was just... Yeah.

01:15:02.617 --> 01:15:04.283
To go from last year,

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:08.283
being told I couldn't have children
and not have a shot,

01:15:08.367 --> 01:15:10.200
to going to...

01:15:11.367 --> 01:15:13.700
even just having one shot.

01:15:15.867 --> 01:15:17.700
I'm excited.

01:15:21.367 --> 01:15:23.158
I have way more...

01:15:25.867 --> 01:15:30.075
to be excited and positive about
than I did a year ago.

01:15:34.867 --> 01:15:37.367
I couldn't be happier.

01:15:41.367 --> 01:15:44.408
Well, obviously, here he is.

01:15:46.825 --> 01:15:50.533
That's Jack.
So that's pretty exciting.

01:15:52.867 --> 01:15:57.283
And then, this is Jack... hatching.

01:16:00.033 --> 01:16:02.367
Those are the only two photos
we've taken of him.

01:16:04.367 --> 01:16:08.158
Trust me, if there were
options to have more,

01:16:08.242 --> 01:16:10.783
they'd be all over the place.

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:12.367
Today is the day...

01:16:13.742 --> 01:16:18.950
we find out if Jack Notaro...

01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:25.075
is in Amanda, if it took or not.

01:16:26.408 --> 01:16:29.700
Stephanie and I joke...

01:16:29.783 --> 01:16:32.117
We joke about, um...

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.325
We say it all the time that,

01:16:35.408 --> 01:16:38.908
you know, we just want
to put little pants on Jack.

01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:44.033
And it makes us laugh so hard.

01:16:44.117 --> 01:16:47.950
But it's also just a true thing, like...

01:16:48.033 --> 01:16:48.992
"Just show up.

01:16:49.075 --> 01:16:51.515
- We just want to put little pants on you."
- "...pants on you."

01:16:51.867 --> 01:16:55.117
Amanda's pregnancy test,
the results are back within three hours.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.992
That is now.

01:16:57.075 --> 01:17:00.867
So we're waiting to get
that fax coming through.

01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:09.075
This is my one last
blood connection to my mother.

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:13.825
I know if the news that he's in there,
if that is the news,

01:17:13.908 --> 01:17:18.075
I don't think it would be possible
to have another bad day

01:17:18.158 --> 01:17:22.033
while I'm alive, you know?

01:17:22.117 --> 01:17:26.867
I just don't see how
that would be possible.

01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:32.117
It'd just be like,
"Here is the cemented good news of...

01:17:33.575 --> 01:17:35.158
forever.

01:17:35.242 --> 01:17:36.533
Enjoy that."

01:17:36.617 --> 01:17:39.617
You know, so...

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:42.367
There's the doctor.

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.742
Oh, my gosh.

01:17:44.825 --> 01:17:47.992
There's the doctor.
Oh, boy.

01:17:53.742 --> 01:17:55.033
Hello?

01:17:56.117 --> 01:17:59.492
Hi, so I got the results
of the blood test,

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:03.283
and unfortunately
I don't have good news for you.

01:18:03.367 --> 01:18:04.408
Uh-huh.

01:18:04.492 --> 01:18:09.283
The results came back
as less than two for pregnancy test

01:18:09.367 --> 01:18:12.408
and that means it's negative.

01:18:13.325 --> 01:18:18.075
So, I'm sorry, Tig.
It didn't work this time.

01:18:20.742 --> 01:18:22.200
It's okay.

01:18:25.783 --> 01:18:28.200
Well, there's the news.

01:18:30.992 --> 01:18:32.325
So...

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.867
I feel like I did all I could.

01:19:37.658 --> 01:19:39.908
Oh, I have to...

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.242
God, I can't focus.

01:19:43.325 --> 01:19:46.242
- How much time do you want me to do?
- What would you like to do?

01:19:46.325 --> 01:19:49.283
- Zero.
- Okay. Perfect.

01:19:49.367 --> 01:19:52.283
- How much are you gonna do, Tig?
- Probably 45.

01:19:52.367 --> 01:19:53.325
- Oh, you are?
- Yeah.

01:19:53.408 --> 01:19:54.992
Oh, okay.

01:19:55.075 --> 01:19:56.450
Uh, what?

01:19:56.533 --> 01:19:57.742
- I know.
- You're gonna host?

01:20:03.533 --> 01:20:05.783
Flowers from my brother.

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:09.075
It says, "To my beautiful
and amazing sister,

01:20:09.158 --> 01:20:11.742
I love you and am so proud of you.

01:20:11.825 --> 01:20:15.283
The only person that would be more proud
would be our mother.

01:20:15.367 --> 01:20:17.700
Good luck tonight.
Love, your brother, Renaud."

01:20:28.867 --> 01:20:31.617
Well, this is what
I'll be saying tonight.

01:20:34.658 --> 01:20:36.658
What if this show is a bomb?

01:20:36.742 --> 01:20:39.200
Oh, my God,
it's not gonna happen.

01:20:39.283 --> 01:20:42.158
Tonight's the most nervous I've seen her,
you know, before this show.

01:20:42.242 --> 01:20:43.450
Because this is the show back.

01:20:43.533 --> 01:20:46.450
I grew up in the streets
of the Grove and...

01:20:48.533 --> 01:20:50.700
Tig is usually
a very cool customer.

01:20:50.783 --> 01:20:54.492
You never really see her frazzled.

01:20:54.575 --> 01:20:57.158
But that night,
she may have been nervous.

01:20:57.242 --> 01:21:01.200
...say things like,
"Not on my watch" and stuff.

01:21:01.283 --> 01:21:02.742
All right.

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:05.783
Let's get to the reason
why we're all here.

01:21:05.867 --> 01:21:07.450
Oh, boy.

01:21:07.533 --> 01:21:10.700
God, I remember the day
she was born. The, um...

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:16.950
The doctor put her on my belly
and she was covered in all this goop,

01:21:17.033 --> 01:21:19.325
and I just said,

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:20.450
"Tig.

01:21:21.908 --> 01:21:24.450
I'll call her Tig."

01:21:24.533 --> 01:21:30.075
Please welcome
my friend, Tig Notaro.

01:21:37.617 --> 01:21:39.117
How's it going?

01:21:40.742 --> 01:21:42.283
Thank you.

01:21:42.367 --> 01:21:45.158
I don't have cancer.
Hello, how are you?

01:21:49.533 --> 01:21:54.533
Thank you so much.
You guys have been so, so great.

01:21:55.533 --> 01:21:56.700
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:57.992 --> 01:22:01.200
I was diagnosed
with bilateral breast cancer.

01:22:02.283 --> 01:22:03.867
Word has not gotten out, so...

01:22:06.825 --> 01:22:12.117
And before my diagnosis
and the surgery,

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.033
I was pretty...
just relatively flat-chested.

01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:20.117
And I've made
so many jokes over the years

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.783
about how flat-chested I was.

01:22:23.867 --> 01:22:26.575
I started to think that maybe...

01:22:26.658 --> 01:22:30.033
my boobs overheard me...

01:22:37.992 --> 01:22:41.033
and were just, like,
"You know what?

01:22:44.908 --> 01:22:46.867
We are sick of this.

01:22:50.367 --> 01:22:51.908
Let's kill her."

01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:00.617
I couldn't believe that I was back onstage
doing an hour of material.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:04.533
I felt like the intro to Mary Tyler Moore.

01:23:04.617 --> 01:23:10.283
I felt like I tossed my hat in the air,
and I just felt like I was back.

01:23:10.367 --> 01:23:11.992
Good night.

01:23:19.533 --> 01:23:22.742
Ready to adopt children?

01:23:22.825 --> 01:23:24.950
Can't wait.

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.283
You don't have to.

01:23:27.367 --> 01:23:28.450
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:31.367 --> 01:23:35.408
We've both, sort of, decided
that we wanna look into adoption,

01:23:35.492 --> 01:23:38.908
and I'm also interested
in having kids of my own together.

01:23:39.033 --> 01:23:40.408
So I think we're gonna end up

01:23:40.492 --> 01:23:43.408
having a bunch of kids
in different ways.

01:23:47.533 --> 01:23:50.325
We need to get a subscription
to Parent magazine...

01:23:50.408 --> 01:23:52.117
immediately.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.950
Hello.

01:23:54.033 --> 01:23:56.033
- Hi.
- How are you guys? I'm Jennifer.

01:23:56.117 --> 01:23:57.617
- Oh, I'm Tig.
- Tig, nice to meet you.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.460
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Stephanie, nice to meet you.

01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:00.867
Come on back.

01:24:05.033 --> 01:24:08.408
Are we gonna put all our bathroom stuff
together in the one downstairs?

01:24:08.492 --> 01:24:10.408
I have no idea.

01:24:10.492 --> 01:24:13.700
It'll all be a mystery
that unfolds.

01:24:19.242 --> 01:24:22.117
Buying this house
has been bittersweet

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.575
because it's the greatest place.

01:24:25.658 --> 01:24:27.200
I wish my mother could be here

01:24:27.283 --> 01:24:31.367
to see what Stephanie and I
are building together,

01:24:31.450 --> 01:24:34.367
and I wish that I could...

01:24:36.242 --> 01:24:38.742
share Stephanie with my mother.

01:24:40.533 --> 01:24:42.117
In here.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.242
This is where children are gonna go.

01:24:44.325 --> 01:24:46.825
We're gonna have
two single beds.

01:24:46.908 --> 01:24:50.492
We'll put one little
newborn infant on each bed

01:24:50.575 --> 01:24:52.742
and just hope
they stay there at night.

01:24:52.825 --> 01:24:54.325
We'll just tell them to stay.

01:24:54.408 --> 01:24:56.992
Oh, yeah, we'll just tell them
to stay in bed.

01:24:57.075 --> 01:24:58.617
This definitely feels like...

01:24:59.617 --> 01:25:02.075
- the beginning of the family.
- Yeah.

01:25:09.283 --> 01:25:12.117
Going through everything that I did,

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.867
it has changed my life as a person,
as a performer.

01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:19.533
I just feel so much more keenly aware

01:25:19.617 --> 01:25:23.908
of how happy and thankful I am
for what I have,

01:25:23.992 --> 01:25:26.450
and I... I feel very lucky.

01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:33.825
This is what being alive is all about.

01:25:33.908 --> 01:25:38.867
Just that idea of taking risks
and seeing the payoff.

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:42.783
You know, it's so cliché,
but it's like you're alive...

01:25:44.533 --> 01:25:47.617
so you might as well take chances.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.742
This is so exciting.
