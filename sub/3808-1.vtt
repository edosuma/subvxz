00:40.071 --> 00:41.874
<i>What a great morning.</i>

00:41.974 --> 00:45.478
<i>The rising sun,
the tweeting of the Terradons.</i>

00:45.578 --> 00:51.014
<i>Today is the perfect day to ask my boss
for that advance on my paycheck.</i>

00:51.750 --> 00:54.652
<i>Wilma deserves a nice vacation.</i>

01:02.362 --> 01:06.597
- What's the matter, Fred?
- I'm already late for work.

02:19.170 --> 02:22.809
Hard work, dedication, a big hammer.

02:23.109 --> 02:26.913
That's how you break rocks.
You listening to me, Mr. Cenastone?

02:27.013 --> 02:29.882
Absolutely, Mr. Slate.
And please, call me John.

02:29.982 --> 02:33.820
I prefer the formality of last names.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.522
Just because you're my sister's
husband's nephew once removed,

02:36.622 --> 02:40.426
- doesn't mean you get special privileges.
- No, sir. I'm here to work.

02:40.526 --> 02:44.230
Good. Because laziness
is one thing I won't tolerate.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.031
Also lateness. I hate that.

02:53.170 --> 02:57.907
Come on, people. Some of us got jobs
we should have been at 20 minutes ago.

03:16.561 --> 03:18.364
It's a livin'.

03:18.564 --> 03:21.767
These prontocranes
are delicate pieces of equipment.

03:21.867 --> 03:24.234
Takes a real expert to run one of these.

03:24.836 --> 03:26.537
Hey, Flintstone!

03:27.238 --> 03:28.305
Flintstone?

03:31.232 --> 03:32.286
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

03:32.486 --> 03:36.179
Flintstone, you'd better
not be sleeping up there!

03:38.382 --> 03:40.319
Flintstone!

03:40.419 --> 03:44.090
Yes, Mr. Slate.
I was just adjusting the...

03:44.190 --> 03:45.991
Well, get back to work!

03:46.091 --> 03:48.928
Yes, sir. I will get back to it.

03:49.028 --> 03:53.062
Work. Which is what I was
doing up here all this time.

04:04.209 --> 04:05.745
Help me!

04:05.845 --> 04:08.948
Hang on, Mr. Slate.
I'll have you down in a jiffy.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.348
There's got to be
an off lever here somewhere.

04:16.721 --> 04:20.760
That was the up lever. Oh, you think
I would have figured that out by now.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.259
Now, let's see here.

04:25.897 --> 04:29.432
My bad! Only one left. Got to be it.

04:38.009 --> 04:39.858
Mr. Slate, you okay?

04:40.646 --> 04:43.916
I'm kissing granite here, Flintstone.
Do I look okay?

04:44.016 --> 04:48.888
Listen. This might not be the best time,
but since I have your attention,

04:48.988 --> 04:54.059
I was wondering if I could get my paycheck
a little early this month?

04:54.159 --> 04:57.463
I'd promised my wife I'd take
the family on a vacation.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.965
- A vacation?
- To Rockapulco.

05:00.065 --> 05:02.067
A vacation!

05:02.167 --> 05:07.204
You almost got me killed
and you want to go on a vacation!

05:10.009 --> 05:14.346
Well, after a day like today
I could use some R&R.

05:14.446 --> 05:16.682
You probably could too.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.215
Dinosaur!

05:32.397 --> 05:33.573
You guys okay?

05:39.938 --> 05:42.041
Wow, that was amazing.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.044
You got some moves, kid.
What's your name?

05:45.144 --> 05:48.948
- Me? I'm John. John Cenastone.
- Good to meet you, John.

05:49.048 --> 05:52.051
- I'm Fred...
- Flintstone, in my office!

05:52.151 --> 05:53.946
Now.

05:58.890 --> 06:00.924
There you go.

06:01.893 --> 06:03.129
Your paycheck.

06:03.229 --> 06:08.131
Seriously? Wow!
Mr. Slate, that's awful generous.

06:08.734 --> 06:13.069
I mean, after all that damage I caused,
I thought you'd be mad.

06:20.278 --> 06:22.349
So, you are mad.

06:47.672 --> 06:52.742
I'm just gonna go in there and tell Wilma
the vacation's off. She'll understand.

06:59.984 --> 07:02.652
Wilma, I'm home!

07:08.494 --> 07:10.627
Missed me that time.

07:16.034 --> 07:18.137
Fred? Is that you?

07:18.537 --> 07:22.775
Honey, listen. There's something I need
to tell you about our vacation.

07:22.875 --> 07:26.243
There's something I need
to show you about our vacation.

07:29.414 --> 07:30.821
Do you like it?

07:34.720 --> 07:38.590
I got it for our trip.
60% off at Marshales.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.626
What did you want to tell me
about the vacation?

07:41.174 --> 07:44.163
Just that...
I'm definitely not canceling it

07:44.263 --> 07:47.497
because of something
that happened at work today.

07:47.732 --> 07:49.766
Well, that's a relief.

07:52.103 --> 07:57.007
I can't even remember the last time
we took a family vacation.

07:58.444 --> 08:00.279
Oh, no. That's Barney and Betty.

08:00.379 --> 08:03.482
We're supposed to go to the Water Buffalo
Charity Carnival together

08:03.582 --> 08:06.285
and here I am
standing around in my bikini.

08:06.385 --> 08:08.184
I have to get changed.

08:09.688 --> 08:12.691
Tame your pterodactyls.
We'll be right out.

08:12.791 --> 08:17.760
Why don't you honk it again?
I didn't hear it the first three times!

08:17.864 --> 08:20.530
You hear it that time, Fred?

08:27.305 --> 08:30.242
I can't believe you're actually
going on vacation.

08:30.342 --> 08:33.111
And to Rockapulco.

08:33.511 --> 08:37.316
I know! I feel like
the luckiest girl in the world.

08:37.416 --> 08:40.283
I feel like a complete idiot.

08:40.385 --> 08:41.653
Honk. Honk.

08:41.753 --> 08:43.923
You should have seen her in that bikini.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.826
I would have liked to have
seen her in that bikini.

08:47.126 --> 08:48.547
Watch it, Rubble!

08:49.695 --> 08:51.136
Hey, I got an idea, Fred.

08:51.236 --> 08:54.900
Wait till you get back from vacation,
then tell her about the paycheck.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.803
But, Barney,
we're not going on vacation.

08:58.003 --> 09:01.338
Oh, don't tell her that, Fred.
It'll ruin your vacation.

09:13.818 --> 09:15.385
Yeah!

09:36.207 --> 09:38.578
You can jump in anytime.

09:39.278 --> 09:42.147
Bamm! Bamm! Bamm!

09:42.247 --> 09:43.602
Bamm!

09:44.315 --> 09:46.718
- Whahoo, yeah!
- Oh, baby!

09:46.818 --> 09:48.985
It's my turn!

09:51.055 --> 09:55.427
Wow, Nikki and Brie Boulder.
So how much is a kiss?

09:55.627 --> 09:57.229
100 clams.

09:57.329 --> 10:00.666
100 clams? That sounds expensive.

10:00.766 --> 10:04.269
Considering you get a kiss
from each of us, it's like half off.

10:04.369 --> 10:06.205
In that case...

10:06.305 --> 10:08.604
I'll take 502.

10:24.122 --> 10:26.692
Fred Flintstone! Get out of that line!

10:26.792 --> 10:29.259
- But it's for charity.
- Now.

10:36.534 --> 10:38.637
Our charity booth is all set up, Fred.

10:38.737 --> 10:42.508
I built the ring, put out the donation
bucket and tied on Hoppy's gloves.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.476
Honk. Honk. Honk.

10:44.776 --> 10:46.578
Anything else you need me to do?

10:46.678 --> 10:51.250
- Yeah. Tell Wilma that the trip's off.
- Sure thing. Hey, Wilma...

10:51.350 --> 10:53.504
- Pipe down, Barn.
- But you said...

10:53.604 --> 10:56.855
I'm never telling her
and you're not telling her either.

10:56.955 --> 10:59.925
I'm going to find a way
out of this jam myself.

11:00.025 --> 11:01.360
That's a great idea, Fred.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.695
I haven't come up
with the idea yet, Barn.

11:03.795 --> 11:06.365
But when you do,
it's gonna be a good one.

11:06.565 --> 11:10.436
Step right up. Five clams
and get your five minutes in the ring.

11:10.536 --> 11:14.373
Make it to the bell without Hoppy
knocking you block off and win a prize!

11:14.473 --> 11:17.474
Who wants to take
some licks for charity?

11:21.646 --> 11:24.447
Keep it above the pouch,
all right, buddy?

11:26.250 --> 11:29.219
Honk. Honk. Honk.

11:30.788 --> 11:31.907
Honk. Honk. Honk.

11:39.497 --> 11:41.441
Honk. Honk. Honk.

11:41.632 --> 11:42.602
Next.

11:43.701 --> 11:45.270
Honk!

11:45.749 --> 11:47.306
Honk!

11:47.706 --> 11:49.154
Honk!

11:50.107 --> 11:52.238
Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk.

11:52.476 --> 11:53.543
Honk. Honk. Honk.

11:56.414 --> 11:58.383
I got this in the bag, Marble Henry.

11:58.483 --> 12:02.487
I know you do, but seriously,
you can just call me Marble.

12:02.587 --> 12:05.924
I prefer the formality of last names.

12:06.430 --> 12:07.439
Honk!

12:08.893 --> 12:12.498
I'm gonna win a prize.
No, no. I'm gonna win two prizes.

12:12.598 --> 12:17.100
- Hey, thanks, man.
- They're both for me. Win your own prize.

12:25.509 --> 12:27.513
- Have fun.
- You have fun.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.146
I'm having a great time. Thanks.

12:32.383 --> 12:37.688
Come on, you big, ugly jumping Dinorat.
It's takedown time!

12:44.729 --> 12:46.827
Honk. Honk.

12:47.265 --> 12:49.632
Hey, easy there, buddy.

12:52.638 --> 12:55.374
He think he's gonna send me flying?

12:55.474 --> 12:57.109
Think again.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.978
I'm CM Punkrock!

13:00.078 --> 13:03.315
And I got you a first class
ticket to my fist!

13:03.815 --> 13:07.452
Listen. He's real sensitive. Maybe you
could cool down the pejoratives?

13:07.552 --> 13:11.655
He's crying. I made the Kangasaurus cry.

13:12.757 --> 13:17.629
Hey, mister. He's a Hopparoo.
And you're being downright mean to him.

13:17.729 --> 13:20.766
Oh, what are you going to do
about it, Shrimpo?

13:20.866 --> 13:23.468
I was gonna ask you to be less mean.

13:23.568 --> 13:26.602
"Less mean"? Like this?

13:29.941 --> 13:34.513
Yo, check it out, Marble Henry.
He ain't so tough now, is he?

13:34.613 --> 13:36.882
He sure ain't.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.158
That's my beloved pet
you're humiliating out there.

13:46.258 --> 13:50.629
I tried talking nice to you but now
I got to take matters into my own hands.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.196
Oh, boy. Easy, Barn.

13:57.201 --> 13:58.268
Aroo!

14:08.946 --> 14:10.682
Honk. Honk.

14:11.817 --> 14:12.782
Honk?

14:18.088 --> 14:19.558
Fred, little help here?

14:19.658 --> 14:22.459
Looking good, buddy.
I think you got him.

14:33.070 --> 14:35.438
- Is that...
- Barney!

14:37.976 --> 14:41.179
That's right. I am CM Punkrock.

14:41.279 --> 14:44.516
I am the best in the prehistoric world,

14:44.616 --> 14:47.383
thanks to my straight-edge lifestyle...

14:56.026 --> 14:59.028
Oh, this raw fish business stinks!

15:06.203 --> 15:09.274
You okay, Barn?
I've never seen you that worked up.

15:09.374 --> 15:12.742
I couldn't just stand there
and watch him tease Hoppy like that.

15:14.112 --> 15:16.915
Hoppy, cut it out! That tickles.

15:17.015 --> 15:19.451
- Best show I've ever seen.
- We should go again.

15:19.551 --> 15:22.287
I'd pay 50 clams to watch
something like that again.

15:22.387 --> 15:24.820
I would pay any price to see that.

15:26.056 --> 15:28.594
That was a heck of a show, Flintstone.
Heck of a show.

15:28.694 --> 15:31.396
Why, thanks, Mr. McMagma.

15:31.496 --> 15:35.031
A fella could make a lot of clams
with a spectacle like that.

15:43.409 --> 15:48.146
Barney Rubble, don't you ever do
anything dangerous like that again!

15:48.246 --> 15:49.948
I don't plan on it, Betty.

15:50.248 --> 15:52.619
Help me up, Marble Henry.

15:54.685 --> 15:55.652
Ouch!

16:06.497 --> 16:08.164
I'm coming to bed in a minute, Betty.

16:09.166 --> 16:11.167
Just got to brush my teeth.

16:14.438 --> 16:17.173
And for this I went to college?

16:18.842 --> 16:20.912
Psst! Barney.

16:21.212 --> 16:24.947
- You scared the paste out of me, Fred.
- I'm aware of that.

16:25.849 --> 16:28.053
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.589
I got this brilliant idea in my head.

16:30.689 --> 16:34.025
We could put on another one of those
crazy matches like you did tonight

16:34.125 --> 16:35.927
and charge folks to come and see it.

16:36.027 --> 16:38.864
I promised Betty I wouldn't do
anything dangerous.

16:38.964 --> 16:43.335
It ain't gonna be dangerous.
It'll be entertainment, like a show.

16:43.435 --> 16:47.339
Wow. A show? I'd pay hard-earned clams
to see something like that.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.910
That's what I'm telling you.
If we do this,

16:50.010 --> 16:53.445
we can make enough clams
to take both our families on a vacation.

16:53.645 --> 16:57.516
Betty sure would love a vacation.
What the heck. I'm in.

16:57.616 --> 17:00.652
Barney, are you talking to someone?

17:00.752 --> 17:03.285
Nope. Just gargling, sweetheart.

17:06.491 --> 17:09.227
We just need to find
some more guys for the show.

17:09.327 --> 17:12.060
And I think I know just where to...

17:13.130 --> 17:14.664
start.

17:18.135 --> 17:20.906
Yabba dabba doo!

17:21.006 --> 17:25.477
Hey, Cenastone, you really showed
that dinosaur who's boss yesterday.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.311
Oh, that? That was no big deal.

17:27.412 --> 17:31.077
Are you kidding?
I tell you, if I had moves like that,

17:31.177 --> 17:34.185
I wouldn't be working in a quarry.

17:34.285 --> 17:37.389
Actually, Mr. Flintstone, I don't plan
on breaking rocks my whole life.

17:37.489 --> 17:40.953
None of us do, kid. None of us do.

17:52.536 --> 17:56.708
- Maybe music is my thing.
- Music? With muscles like that?

17:56.808 --> 18:00.111
Listen. Me and my pal Barney
are putting together

18:00.211 --> 18:03.448
a little sports entertainment
event this weekend.

18:03.548 --> 18:08.720
And you my dinosaur-throwing friend,
would be perfect for it.

18:09.120 --> 18:13.124
- Me? You think?
- Oh, I don't think. I know.

18:13.224 --> 18:17.095
Now if we could just find
a few more big strong fellas like you,

18:17.195 --> 18:19.161
we'd have ourselves a show.

18:20.765 --> 18:23.299
I might be able to help you out there.

18:45.255 --> 18:47.175
Booyaka!

18:48.492 --> 18:50.059
Yeah!

18:50.460 --> 18:52.594
619!

19:23.260 --> 19:24.827
Thanks.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.934
No, thanks.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.830
Daniel Bryrock, have a flyer.

19:44.930 --> 19:48.019
No, thanks, Cenastone.
I don't want your flyer.

19:48.119 --> 19:52.023
- Please, please. I insist.
- I said, "No, I don't".

19:52.123 --> 19:56.795
- But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.
- No, I don't!

19:56.895 --> 19:59.631
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't!

19:59.731 --> 20:02.200
- Yes, you do!
- No, I don't!

20:02.300 --> 20:05.367
- Yes, you do!
- No, I don't!

20:06.303 --> 20:08.540
- No, you don't!
- Yes, I do!

20:08.640 --> 20:13.176
- No, you don't!
- I say, yes, I do!

20:14.278 --> 20:18.483
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

20:18.583 --> 20:21.553
Yes! Yes! Yes!

20:21.653 --> 20:25.421
- You think that guy's coming to the event?
- I'm gonna say, no.

20:27.025 --> 20:29.773
- Hey, watch where you're going.
- Sorry about that.

20:29.873 --> 20:34.666
You're that guy from the lodge. The one
who tag teamed me with that Dinohop.

20:34.766 --> 20:37.599
Hopparoo. He's a Hopparoo.

20:38.035 --> 20:40.972
Well, I think he's a dumbaroo.

20:41.072 --> 20:43.708
And I didn't like getting
kicked out of the ring.

20:43.808 --> 20:47.010
I didn't like it one bit.

20:48.646 --> 20:50.916
And now I got you right where I want you

20:51.016 --> 20:53.251
- and I'm going to give you...
- Ice cream!

20:53.351 --> 20:56.955
Marble Henry!
We are not giving him ice cream.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.624
We're giving him a beatdown.

20:59.724 --> 21:01.257
Everything okay, Barn?

21:02.559 --> 21:05.947
Everything's fine.
Just having a little chat.

21:06.047 --> 21:09.868
As far as chats go,
that one was on the intimidating side.

21:09.968 --> 21:13.053
You're ice cream's melting.

21:17.641 --> 21:20.309
Come on, Marble Henry.
Let's get outta here.

21:24.414 --> 21:27.583
- You lick this one?
- I can't remember.

21:29.820 --> 21:32.557
No, I licked the other one.

21:34.592 --> 21:37.061
I get the feeling that guy
doesn't like me so much.

21:37.161 --> 21:40.562
Don't sweat it, buddy.
We got bigger fish to fry.

21:46.236 --> 21:49.171
Fred, dinner's almost ready.

21:52.542 --> 21:57.112
Honey, didn't I tell you?
I'm playing poker with the boys tonight.

21:59.116 --> 22:01.064
Hey, what's cookin'?

22:04.221 --> 22:07.823
Smells delicious!
Sorry I'm missing it. Got to go!

22:08.091 --> 22:09.227
Don't wait up!

22:09.327 --> 22:12.163
- Fred?
- Yeah, Wilma?

22:12.463 --> 22:15.264
- Fred?
- Wilma?

22:17.868 --> 22:20.939
You're not going to try to double
our vacation fund

22:21.039 --> 22:23.775
in some harebrained poker game, are you?

22:25.147 --> 22:26.877
What? No!

22:26.977 --> 22:32.050
I am not gonna try to double our vacation
fund in some harebrained poker game.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.218
That is a fact.

22:36.486 --> 22:39.988
There's nothing
to worry about, sweetheart.

22:40.088 --> 22:43.725
Your Freddy boy's
got it all under control.

23:00.445 --> 23:05.116
When Freddy boy says don't worry,
I start worrying.

23:06.225 --> 23:07.701
Yup.

23:10.988 --> 23:13.558
We are good to go, Barn.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.425
Wilma doesn't suspect a thing.

23:19.529 --> 23:21.733
You're sure no one's gonna care
if we use the fairgrounds?

23:21.833 --> 23:27.071
It's empty for the season. Besides we can't
just go back to the Water Buffalo Lodge.

23:27.171 --> 23:29.107
People have been there, done that.

23:29.207 --> 23:33.678
Trust me. This spot's the perfect venue
for tonight's scheme.

23:33.778 --> 23:36.348
- You mean "event". Right, Fred?
- That's what I said.

23:36.448 --> 23:38.783
Oh, sorry, Fred.
I could have sworn you said "scheme."

23:38.883 --> 23:43.452
Focus. Barney.
I need you givin' 111% tonight.

23:57.634 --> 24:03.274
Look at that crowd, Barney.
Every one of them is worth 10 clams.

24:03.374 --> 24:07.111
We've already got enough to take the wives
and kids on a week-long vacation.

24:07.211 --> 24:10.882
Yeah, now all we have to do is make them
not want to ask for their clams back.

24:11.082 --> 24:14.817
Don't worry, pal.
These guys are itching for action.

24:30.100 --> 24:32.468
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

24:34.873 --> 24:37.675
Sorry, Mr. Flintstone. I pulled
a double shift at the quarry today.

24:37.775 --> 24:41.512
Come on, guys.
We got paying customers out there,

24:41.612 --> 24:43.648
waiting for the show of their lives.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.932
- This is no time for shell phones.
- Hey!

24:47.618 --> 24:49.785
Or tablets.

24:50.788 --> 24:53.722
I need you guys looking tough.

24:56.026 --> 24:57.795
That's more like it!

24:57.895 --> 25:01.697
What's with this suit, Mysteriopal?
You look ridiculous.

25:03.133 --> 25:05.203
Hey, my sleeve!

25:05.303 --> 25:07.818
Hey, my other sleeve!

25:08.205 --> 25:13.209
Now we're getting somewhere. I just
need to do something about them slacks.

25:18.982 --> 25:21.462
How did you know I was wearing these?

25:21.562 --> 25:25.354
I didn't.
Let's just consider this a lucky break.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.962
These must have been
left over from the circus.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.907
- Wait, Fred. Why do I need these?
- For your match.

25:42.047 --> 25:44.509
Whoa! No, no, no, Fred.
I promised Betty...

25:44.609 --> 25:48.046
Like I said, this ain't dangerous.
It's an event.

25:48.146 --> 25:51.015
- I don't know.
- Think about it, Barn.

25:51.115 --> 25:55.186
Your beautiful family on the beach.
Not a care in the world.

25:55.286 --> 25:59.657
The sound of lapping waves,
the smell of the crisp ocean air.

25:59.757 --> 26:02.126
How can Betty get mad about that?

26:02.226 --> 26:06.328
Barney, you're the best husband ever!

26:08.932 --> 26:10.666
Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Bamm!

26:11.668 --> 26:14.733
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Attaboy!

26:15.873 --> 26:18.443
Are these things supposed
to be this tight?

26:18.543 --> 26:21.678
They're creeping up something terrible.

26:23.081 --> 26:26.782
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- That makes two of us.

26:30.488 --> 26:32.423
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:32.523 --> 26:36.959
boys and girls,
are you ready for action?

26:40.597 --> 26:43.801
We're about to make prehistory tonight.

26:43.901 --> 26:46.571
Two will enter the ring
for the match of their lives.

26:46.671 --> 26:49.605
But only one can be the champion.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.466
It's caveman versus caveman

26:54.566 --> 26:58.723
in the ultimate sports spectacular!

27:00.717 --> 27:03.021
Flintstone might be onto something here.

27:03.321 --> 27:06.857
John Cenastone...

27:08.825 --> 27:13.795
Versus Rey Mysteriopal.

27:18.335 --> 27:21.084
All right, guys. You know what to do.

27:21.184 --> 27:23.775
Mr. Flintstone,
we don't know what to do.

27:24.075 --> 27:26.344
Get out there and put a hurt
on each other.

27:26.444 --> 27:28.349
But we're friends.

27:28.578 --> 27:30.381
Work with me, Cenastone.

27:30.481 --> 27:34.852
All you got to do is treat Mysteriopal
like that dinosaur the other day.

27:34.952 --> 27:37.922
You toss him around a bit,
get the crowd excited.

27:38.022 --> 27:42.330
- Give 'em a show!
- Oh, a show? Right, you got it.

28:18.907 --> 28:19.923
What?

28:20.798 --> 28:22.400
Where are you going?

28:22.500 --> 28:26.771
I tossed him around just like you said.
Sports entertainment is fun.

28:26.871 --> 28:29.907
- But wait!
- One move and it's over?

28:30.007 --> 28:34.309
- I want my clams back.
- This isn't good.

28:37.148 --> 28:38.683
You got to win 'em back, Barney.

28:38.783 --> 28:40.416
- But, Fred...
- But nothing.

28:43.586 --> 28:48.826
That was just an appetizer, folks.
Now it's time for the main event.

28:48.926 --> 28:51.927
Battling Barney Rubble...

28:52.429 --> 28:54.398
Versus...

28:54.498 --> 28:57.099
Hey, buddy, I just realized
I never caught your name.

28:59.604 --> 29:02.370
The Undertaker.

29:04.174 --> 29:07.442
Wow, that is some scary name.

29:11.144 --> 29:14.282
I don't know if I want
to do this anymore.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.459
Barney, stop running! Get in there.

29:27.398 --> 29:31.633
My ears hear you, Fred,
but my feet got a different idea.

29:40.577 --> 29:43.078
Let me out of here!

29:59.530 --> 30:02.528
- Barney, come down from there.
- No!

30:02.928 --> 30:05.737
- Get down!
- I don't wanna.

30:06.737 --> 30:09.475
These people paid to see some action.

30:14.111 --> 30:16.147
Which means you've
got to give 'em some action.

30:16.247 --> 30:17.368
I like it up here.

30:17.468 --> 30:20.916
Sorry, buddy.
I got to do this, for the vacation.

30:31.027 --> 30:34.363
- What happened?
- You pinned him, Barn. Just hold him there.

30:35.932 --> 30:38.035
One, two...

30:38.135 --> 30:41.305
Barney Rubble,
what do you think you're doing?

30:41.405 --> 30:42.193
Yikes!

30:46.643 --> 30:50.348
One, two, three!

30:50.448 --> 30:53.985
Barney, you come out
of that cage this instant!

30:54.385 --> 30:56.767
I don't want to come out.
It's safer in here.

30:59.456 --> 31:00.958
Fred Flintstone.

31:02.677 --> 31:05.396
- Hi, honey.
- Don't "Hi, honey" me.

31:05.496 --> 31:07.875
You raise this cage right now!

31:08.431 --> 31:10.941
Oh, boy!

31:16.072 --> 31:19.710
You look beautiful tonight, Betty. Did you
do something different with your hair?

31:19.810 --> 31:21.412
Not even a little.

31:21.512 --> 31:26.317
You said you weren't going to try to double
our clams in some harebrained scheme.

31:26.417 --> 31:29.687
Actually, I said I wasn't
going to try to double our clams

31:29.787 --> 31:31.822
in some harebrained poker game.

31:32.022 --> 31:37.962
I did, however, double our clams in a
harebrained sports entertainment event.

31:38.362 --> 31:44.432
Now, we can all go on a real vacation
to Rockapulco together.

31:45.168 --> 31:49.273
Is that true, Barney? This was all
so we could go on vacation together?

31:49.373 --> 31:53.077
Sure was. Fred came up with the idea
after he destroyed the quarry,

31:53.177 --> 31:56.745
nearly killed his boss
and had his paycheck taken away.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.413
He what?

32:04.087 --> 32:06.690
Now, honey, I know you're mad,

32:06.790 --> 32:10.861
but I need you to keep
something in mind. Rockapulco.

32:10.961 --> 32:13.197
Rockapulco,

32:13.297 --> 32:16.598
Rockapulco, Rockapulco.

32:17.967 --> 32:21.572
Okay, but you better not do this again.

32:21.672 --> 32:25.943
Cross my heart, Wilma.
I got the vacation fund, I'm done.

32:26.043 --> 32:27.942
Come on, Barney.

32:31.381 --> 32:34.819
- That was amazing.
- Best show I've ever seen.

32:34.919 --> 32:38.689
- Oh, wasn't it awesome?
- Man, I can't wait to watch the next one.

32:38.789 --> 32:41.259
I'm going to buy a T-shirt.

32:42.159 --> 32:46.127
Flintstone, you've got yourself
something real special here.

33:04.313 --> 33:07.759
Flintstone! Flintstone! Flintstone!

33:26.572 --> 33:30.538
<i>You've got yourself
something real special here.</i>

33:38.881 --> 33:40.951
Flintstone!

33:41.051 --> 33:43.053
You know my policy on laziness.

33:43.153 --> 33:45.489
Mr. Slate, I'm sorry. I just...

33:45.589 --> 33:49.190
One more slip up from you
and you're fired!

33:51.460 --> 33:53.517
But, Mr. Slate...

33:57.467 --> 34:00.137
You know what? I quit.

34:00.237 --> 34:04.508
I don't need this job anyway.
I got something else going.

34:04.608 --> 34:09.310
Something special,
something that's gonna make me rich.

34:14.350 --> 34:17.121
What are you slow-clapping about?

34:17.221 --> 34:19.020
Knock it off!

34:55.491 --> 34:58.295
- You better get out of my way.
- I got a proposition for you.

34:58.495 --> 35:02.266
I got a proposition for you.
Get outta our way.

35:02.366 --> 35:05.302
That's totally not a proposition,
Marble Henry.

35:05.402 --> 35:08.372
- Sorry, Punkrock.
- Continue, Flintstone.

35:08.472 --> 35:10.474
How would you like
to get even with Barney?

35:10.574 --> 35:11.976
The guy with the Kangarino?

35:12.076 --> 35:15.145
It's a Hopparoo,
but, yeah, that's the fella.

35:15.245 --> 35:20.147
- What? Like a rematch?
- Exactly like a rematch.

35:22.118 --> 35:24.655
By the way, it's tonight
at the Bedrock Arena.

35:24.755 --> 35:27.415
The rematch on live television.

35:28.425 --> 35:33.128
Call the Boulder twins.
Nikki and Brie are always up for fun.

35:44.674 --> 35:46.583
Psst! Barney.

35:48.879 --> 35:51.115
Geez, Fred, ever heard of a front door?

35:51.215 --> 35:56.815
I did something, Barney. Something that's
gonna make us rich. Richer than rich.

35:56.915 --> 36:00.524
I should like the sound of that,
but for some reason I'm skeptical.

36:00.624 --> 36:04.695
We didn't go big enough,
so we're gonna do another match tonight.

36:04.795 --> 36:07.498
I signed a contract
with a television station.

36:07.598 --> 36:11.368
I rented out the Bedrock Arena
and bought this fancy suit.

36:11.468 --> 36:13.037
Where did you get the clams for that?

36:13.137 --> 36:15.842
- I spent the vacation fund.
- You did what?

36:17.808 --> 36:20.277
Barney? You've been in there a while.

36:20.377 --> 36:23.063
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, not really.

36:23.781 --> 36:27.242
- Fred, you got to get those clams back.
- Oh, forget it.

36:27.342 --> 36:31.188
Those clams are chump change
compared to what we're gonna make tonight.

36:31.288 --> 36:33.791
No, I can't do it. I'm done.

36:33.891 --> 36:37.214
Hey, you can't be done.
I haven't even told you the best part.

36:37.314 --> 36:41.999
The main event is going to be a rematch
between you and CM Punkrock.

36:42.099 --> 36:46.236
That's not the best part. That sounds like
the worst part. That fellow scares me.

36:46.336 --> 36:50.140
You know what your problem is, Barney?
You got no vision.

36:50.240 --> 36:53.644
- You're not dreaming big enough.
- You got clam-fever, Fred.

36:53.744 --> 36:58.746
Think about the girls. Think about the kids.
Think about the umbrella drinks.

36:59.782 --> 37:03.087
- You're right, Barney.
- You were really freaking me out.

37:03.187 --> 37:07.188
- I'm going to get the clams.
- Good. Good, Fred.

37:07.757 --> 37:10.694
I'm gonna get all the clams.

37:10.794 --> 37:14.267
- You say something?
- Nope, not a word.

37:39.222 --> 37:42.891
Welcome, Bedrock,
to the Saturday night spectacle.

37:47.563 --> 37:52.603
A few days ago, I was just some
schlub working at the quarry.

37:52.703 --> 37:57.973
But now look at me.
Fancy suit, sunglasses, pinky ring.

37:59.208 --> 38:01.303
I'm swimming in clams

38:01.403 --> 38:06.481
and it's all because I didn't give up
on a dream I've had for almost a week.

38:09.786 --> 38:12.790
I found the meanest, the toughest,

38:12.890 --> 38:15.993
the wildest superstars in Bedrock

38:16.093 --> 38:20.495
and they're here tonight
to serve up a beatdown!

38:22.466 --> 38:25.533
John Cenastone!

38:26.168 --> 38:29.370
Rey Mysteriopal.

38:30.106 --> 38:32.907
And The Undertaker.

38:34.644 --> 38:37.014
Barney! Barney!

38:37.495 --> 38:42.119
Yeah, about that... Now, I know I may
have said something about a rematch

38:42.219 --> 38:44.506
between Barney and CM Punkrock...

38:47.224 --> 38:50.491
But Barney couldn't make it tonight.

38:52.728 --> 38:56.564
Forget Barney.
Who needs Rubble when you got me?

38:59.136 --> 39:02.970
And these guys.
You can't forget about these guys.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.477
Fellas, what's the big deal?

39:07.577 --> 39:10.214
- Forget Barney?
- He's your best friend.

39:10.814 --> 39:13.050
"Was" my best friend.

39:13.150 --> 39:17.152
And he's gonna be sorry
when I take me straight to the top.

39:19.656 --> 39:22.860
Us. Us straight to the top. I meant us.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.395
Listen. You two are up first.

39:25.495 --> 39:28.532
But I can't have any more
good-natured tickle fights.

39:28.632 --> 39:31.568
I want to see you two
destroy each other.

39:31.668 --> 39:33.470
But we like each other.

39:33.570 --> 39:37.074
Not anymore, you don't.
The people want drama.

39:37.174 --> 39:41.745
So from now on you're enemies who can't
wait to tear each other's heads off.

39:41.845 --> 39:44.314
In a family-friendly way, of course.

39:44.514 --> 39:47.384
Mr. Flintstone, this isn't really
what we signed up for.

39:47.484 --> 39:50.654
Fame, fortune. What more could you want?

39:50.754 --> 39:54.224
- Friends.
- No Barney, no us.

39:54.324 --> 39:59.694
- Wait. Guys.
- Not cool, Fred. Not cool.

40:02.064 --> 40:06.234
The Undertaker, I thought we were buds.

40:13.209 --> 40:15.012
Oh, boy.

40:15.112 --> 40:19.850
You offended your superstars,
you lied to your best friend,

40:19.950 --> 40:23.154
you lost your vacation fund. Again.

40:24.087 --> 40:29.960
Fred Flintstone, you bonehead.
What have you done?

40:30.060 --> 40:32.894
Where is he? Where is Rubble?

40:34.798 --> 40:39.279
That Kangahop-loving shrimpo,
Barney Dumbbell

40:39.379 --> 40:41.505
may have got lucky the first time,

40:41.605 --> 40:45.973
but it looks like he's too chicken
to face me again.

40:46.076 --> 40:48.979
Maybe that chicken is a turkey.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.298
Good one, sis.

40:52.516 --> 40:54.651
- We want Rubble!
- Where is he?

40:54.751 --> 40:56.018
Coward!

40:56.253 --> 41:01.158
I came for a rematch
and I want my rematch!

41:01.258 --> 41:03.627
Rematch! Rematch!

41:03.727 --> 41:07.900
Rematch! Rematch! Rematch! Rematch!

41:10.166 --> 41:12.469
Let's get out of here.
Rubble isn't going to show.

41:12.569 --> 41:16.473
Hey! Barney Rubble is my best friend,

41:16.573 --> 41:19.509
but I lied to him and told him
this match was canceled.

41:19.609 --> 41:25.212
So, maybe it's time I make things right
and get in the ring myself.

41:29.752 --> 41:32.089
I'm gonna destroy you.

41:32.189 --> 41:35.123
Let's yabba dabba do this!

41:41.465 --> 41:44.968
I still can't believe
we're all going to Rockapulco.

41:45.068 --> 41:50.825
Yeah. For once it seems like one of Fred's
crazy schemes actually paid off.

41:50.925 --> 41:54.011
Betty, Wilma?
You might want to see this.

41:54.111 --> 41:55.210
Fred!

42:02.018 --> 42:03.017
Dada.

42:07.323 --> 42:09.192
I didn't think he was
gonna go through with it.

42:09.292 --> 42:11.627
He said he was going to get
the vacation fund back.

42:13.563 --> 42:16.400
Come on, Flintstone.
The people want a show.

42:16.500 --> 42:18.735
You would think our radiant hotness
would be enough.

42:18.835 --> 42:20.943
Maybe we need to turn up the heat.

42:25.175 --> 42:27.244
Give the people what they want.

42:27.344 --> 42:31.019
- Who are those girls?
- It doesn't matter, Betty.

42:31.119 --> 42:35.684
Because all the well-toned muscle
and over-priced hair product in the world

42:35.784 --> 42:37.018
can't save them.

42:46.630 --> 42:50.298
This is more fun
than making a Hopakang cry.

42:53.636 --> 42:55.870
He's a Hopparoo!

43:04.047 --> 43:05.880
Did I do that?

43:10.886 --> 43:13.054
That's what I do!

43:20.289 --> 43:22.299
Pretty lights!

43:49.759 --> 43:51.926
Thanks, fellas.

43:52.495 --> 43:53.831
The Undertaker.

43:54.331 --> 43:57.656
Hi, buddy, great to see... You?

44:02.872 --> 44:07.541
You're messing with the world's
strongest caveman!

44:09.678 --> 44:13.281
Rest in peace!

44:24.628 --> 44:30.665
There's only one best
in the prehistoric world and that's me!

45:31.694 --> 45:34.079
This is getting ridiculous.

46:00.022 --> 46:03.891
Nobody hurts my friend. Got it, mister?

46:12.135 --> 46:14.886
- We were just...
- Leaving.

46:19.208 --> 46:21.626
Barney! You saved me!

46:21.726 --> 46:23.847
Fred you would have done
the same for me.

46:23.947 --> 46:28.251
I was a real jerk. If I'd have listened
to you in the first place,

46:28.351 --> 46:30.987
we wouldn't have gotten caught up
in all these hijinks.

46:31.087 --> 46:35.289
If it wasn't for hijinks,
we wouldn't have any jinks at all.

46:43.432 --> 46:46.970
Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Bamm!

46:47.170 --> 46:50.373
Wow. That kid's got some serious skills.

46:50.473 --> 46:53.191
Don't even think about it, Fred.

46:55.978 --> 46:58.215
I know what you're gonna say, Wilma.

46:58.315 --> 47:01.918
But I swear, this time I'm done.

47:02.018 --> 47:04.685
I'm just glad you're okay, Fred.

47:12.828 --> 47:15.298
Flintstone, where are you going?
You can't leave now.

47:15.598 --> 47:18.268
This is a big time idea you've got here.

47:18.368 --> 47:21.338
I'm not looking
for the big time, Mr. McMagma.

47:21.438 --> 47:25.342
I was just looking to take my family
and friends to Rockapulco.

47:25.942 --> 47:30.814
Hey, why don't you take the idea?
You'd be doing me a favor.

47:30.914 --> 47:34.117
Then the least I can do is send you
on an all-expense paid trip.

47:34.217 --> 47:37.926
- Drinks and gratuities included?
- It would be my pleasure.

47:38.026 --> 47:41.558
I'm going to make the biggest sports
entertainment company in the world,

47:41.658 --> 47:45.292
even if it takes me 65 million years.

47:49.664 --> 47:53.903
Rockapulco with my best girl
and my best friends.

47:54.003 --> 47:56.072
It couldn't be more perfect.

47:56.172 --> 48:00.310
Yeah, Fred, I have to give it to you.
Your harebrained scheme actually paid off.

48:00.410 --> 48:02.379
Barney, don't encourage him.

48:02.479 --> 48:05.548
He's just lucky Mr. Slate
gave him his job back.

48:05.648 --> 48:10.353
He had to. Turns out clam fever
was an actual medical condition.

48:10.453 --> 48:14.190
You know, when you think about it,
I was a victim in this whole thing.

48:14.290 --> 48:19.162
- Fred.
- Don't worry, Wilma. I learnt my lesson.

48:19.262 --> 48:21.331
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

48:21.431 --> 48:25.935
The karaoke contest is about
to begin in the hotel lounge.

48:26.035 --> 48:29.072
Karaoke contest? That sounds like fun.

48:29.172 --> 48:32.108
Forget it, Barn. We're here to relax.

48:32.208 --> 48:34.778
We're not getting caught up
in anymore hijinks.

48:34.878 --> 48:38.915
The first place winner will automatically
make it into the top 10

48:39.015 --> 48:42.686
on this year's
season of Prehistoric Idol.

48:43.086 --> 48:46.448
Your singing career starts here, folks.

48:52.561 --> 48:56.893
- Should we try to stop them?
- Would it matter if we did?

48:58.201 --> 49:00.769
Yabba dabba doo!
