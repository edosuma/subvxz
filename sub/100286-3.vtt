[laughing]

04:26.266 --> 04:27.642

Just fucking, like...

04:34.732 --> 04:36.234
They suck each other's tongues.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.112
I saw this young couple in an elevator
just making out.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.989
Didn't care that we were in the elevator.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.116
Sucking each other like licorice.
[puckers]

04:43.199 --> 04:45.535
Then he stuck his finger down her throat.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.036
[laughing]

04:47.453 --> 04:50.164
Right, just stuck it...
and she started sucking it

04:50.248 --> 04:51.457
like it was a penis.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.836
If I tried to stick my finger
in my wife's mouth,

04:54.919 --> 04:56.754
she'd be like... [imitates choking]
"What the...

04:56.838 --> 04:59.007
-What the fuck was that?
-[audience laughs]

04:59.340 --> 05:00.383

[continued laughing]

05:05.054 --> 05:08.933
If you don't want to listen to me, tell me
to shut the fuck up. Don't do that.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.396
You scratched your nuts for a half hour
on the couch watching the game.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.023
[cackling]

05:15.356 --> 05:17.984
All I taste is mushrooms.
I hate mushrooms.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.201
[chuckles] Around 45, you stop kissing.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.620
That's when you're like... [puckering]

05:29.954 --> 05:31.122
[puckering] "Hi. Goodbye."

05:31.205 --> 05:34.167
Yeah, 'cause he has a dead tooth
and you don't have dental.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.795
"Let's not do that anymore, how's that?"

05:37.879 --> 05:40.882
Even when you're banging, you're like,
[puckering] "This is good. You like..."

05:40.965 --> 05:43.885
What'd you have, a Panera salad for lunch?
I taste purple onions.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.263
[puckers] Yeah, I think there's one stuck
in your dead tooth.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.973
You want to suck it out for me?"

Remember finger-fucking? Remember that?
Remember finger-popping?

06:02.653 --> 06:05.865
Remember sticking your fingers in her?
Just... [indistinct groan]

06:05.948 --> 06:06.866
[laughter]

06:07.116 --> 06:09.327
That's a young man's game, finger-banging.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.038
That's a young man's game.
You can't... [chuckles]

06:12.121 --> 06:13.915
You know what I mean?
Like, you can't finger...

06:13.998 --> 06:15.375
I can't finger-bang.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.544

-[laughing]
-[yelling] "Fuck, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"

06:22.924 --> 06:25.802

[laughter]

06:28.179 --> 06:29.555
"This is sexy." [laughs]

06:30.098 --> 06:31.933
You know how mad
she'd be on a dinner date?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.768
We get in the car, I'm like,
"You like that?"

06:33.851 --> 06:35.103
"No, I don't!

[audience laughs]

06:40.608 --> 06:42.151
Why would I have to pee now?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.445
-Great, now I have to pee.
-[continued laughter]

06:44.529 --> 06:46.989
Yes, I'm mad. We just went to Tony Romo's,

06:47.073 --> 06:49.325
you had the ribs
and didn't wash your hands.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.035
Yes, I'm fucking mad.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.206
I don't even eat their ribs.
Now the sauce is in my vagina.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.417
[imitates retching] I'm going to throw up.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.086
I'm going to throw up on my vagina.
[retches]

07:00.837 --> 07:03.714
I'm going to throw up on my vagina
in a Honda CRV.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.758
Thanks for the dream life, fuckface.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.968
[continued laughter]

07:07.051 --> 07:09.929
I got to wash my coochie
at a Mobil on the way home

07:10.012 --> 07:12.265
'cause I married a fucking idiot.
Pull over.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.851
[yelling] No, a baby wipe's not
going to cut it!

07:22.150 --> 07:24.986
Young people finger-fuck outside,
they don't give a shit.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.863
Women don't care either, you know,

07:26.946 --> 07:29.240
"There's people, just look normal.
Look normal."

07:29.365 --> 07:30.324
[audience laughs]

07:35.580 --> 07:37.623
People calling the cops,
"Yeah, there's a young girl

07:37.707 --> 07:40.668
nodding off from heroin
in front of the Rio right now."

07:40.751 --> 07:42.253
[uproarious laughter]

07:46.299 --> 07:47.175
[Robert chuckles]

07:48.134 --> 07:50.761
You can't finger-fuck
a middle-aged woman. That's...

07:50.970 --> 07:54.765
That's disrespectful.
It's just like rude. It's fucking rude.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.686
It's creepy. If I saw you
finger-fucking her... [laughs]

07:58.978 --> 08:02.106
outside, I'm like, "Sir, leave her alone.
Stop that.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.317
Call 911. Call them now.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.611

Is this a good thing
or a bad thing? Talk to us.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.366
We're here to help you."

08:19.081 --> 08:21.250
Yeah, it's weird. Sex dies.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.961
And you feel guilty about it,
you don't fuck as much.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.421
And you feel guilty.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.841
Women, though I think you're phonies
with that shit.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.384
Yeah, because women love...

08:30.843 --> 08:32.803
you know, blaming us,
"Why can't we have sex?"

08:32.887 --> 08:34.722
You don't want to fuck either. Stop it.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.890
[laughter]

08:36.015 --> 08:38.017
You know what I mean?
Is that your wife right there?

08:38.100 --> 08:39.894
-Is that... your girlfriend?
-[man] Girlfriend.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.688
Yeah, your girlfriend. You can tell
'cause you're holding each other.

08:42.772 --> 08:43.856
[laughter]

08:44.023 --> 08:46.150
Did you...
You were married, though, right?

08:46.234 --> 08:48.486
Yeah, you dumped her
and upped for this one?

08:48.569 --> 08:49.570
-[audience laughs]
-Yeah.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.406
What, she have a receding hairline,
didn't do it for you anymore?

08:52.490 --> 08:53.324
What happened?

08:53.407 --> 08:54.825
[laughing]

08:55.826 --> 08:56.953
Is this your wife?

08:57.036 --> 08:59.247
-Yeah, how long you been married?
-Coming up to 18 years.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.624
Eighteen fucking years, holy shit.

[cheering and applause]

09:04.001 --> 09:05.169
Fucking crazy.

Okay, this is fucked up.
Listen to me. [laughs]

09:19.892 --> 09:21.602
Look at me. That means,

09:21.686 --> 09:22.687
this man right here,

09:22.853 --> 09:26.983
that woman is the only person
to see his dick

09:28.234 --> 09:29.777
in almost your life.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.821
[uproarious laughter]

09:34.073 --> 09:37.785
The last woman to see his dick

09:43.916 --> 09:45.793
You don't even remember her, do you?

09:46.252 --> 09:49.714
What was her name, Helga?
[stammers] What old fucking broad name...

09:49.797 --> 09:50.673
Olga?

09:51.048 --> 09:53.759
He got a hand job
at a fucking apple picking.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.886

your dick besides her, right?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.769
You still talk to her on Facebook,
don't you, little motherfucker, right?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.438
-[whooping and laughter]
-You know you do.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.527
It's fucked up.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.071
I talk to my wife about that shit.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.531
I've been married a long time.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.700
I was like, "Baby, can I talk
to you about something?"

10:17.783 --> 10:19.785
She's like, "What's up?"
I'm like, "Is it true...

10:20.453 --> 10:23.789
like, nobody can touch my dick,
like, ever again?"

10:23.873 --> 10:26.292
-[laughter]
-She's like, "Yeah, that's true."

10:26.417 --> 10:29.045
I'm like, "Not even for, like,
April Fool's or something?

10:29.128 --> 10:29.962
[audience laughs]

10:30.046 --> 10:32.548
Like, your friend jerks me off,
but you're in the closet.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.176
You're like, 'April Fool's, motherfucker.
Not happening!'"

10:35.301 --> 10:36.427
[laughter]

10:36.636 --> 10:38.929
She got mad, she was like,
"No, why would you want that?"

10:39.013 --> 10:41.932
I'm like, "You know I'm dirty.
I'm perver... I like to fantasize."

10:42.016 --> 10:45.144
She's like, "Well, if you loved me,
you'd fantasize about me sexually."

10:45.269 --> 10:46.896
I'm like, "That's not fantasy.

10:47.104 --> 10:50.483
-That's reality. I want to fantasize.
-[laughing]

10:50.566 --> 10:53.402
I want a chick with a horn
and three tits and a...

10:54.028 --> 10:57.865
a vagina that speaks kind
words of wisdom to my penis."

10:57.948 --> 11:01.035
"The walls of lack and delay
now crumble away.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.746
Fulfill your destiny, Bobby!

11:04.372 --> 11:06.165
Think outside my box. Ha-ha!"

11:06.374 --> 11:07.750
[audience laughs]

11:09.835 --> 11:12.129
This is what she said,
this is why I think you're phonies.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.131
She goes, "I don't fantasize
about other people."

11:14.215 --> 11:16.092
I'm like,
"You don't fantasize about other men?"

11:16.175 --> 11:19.845
She goes, "No, I fantasize about you
sexually because I love you."

11:20.054 --> 11:21.555
I'm like, "When I'm gone,

11:22.014 --> 11:24.100
I'm on the road for five days.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.351
You're home alone.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.270
The kid's asleep,
it's like nine o'clock at night.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.148
And you take an hour shower by yourself.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.484
And you come out in just a robe.

11:33.567 --> 11:37.530
You lie in a big king bed,
and that robe falls off your titties.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.701
And the ceiling fan hits your nipples
like a York Peppermint Pattie.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.494
[audience laughs]

11:45.162 --> 11:47.456
And your nipple becomes a light switch.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.083
[continued laughter]

11:49.417 --> 11:52.378
And then you reach into that drawer
on your side of the bed

11:52.461 --> 11:54.880
and pull out that
Brookstones foot massager.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.841
[laughing]

11:57.591 --> 11:59.176
That's never seen a foot.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.347
Doesn't even know what feet look like

12:03.556 --> 12:04.974
[cackling]

12:05.099 --> 12:08.060
but somehow changed colors
over the last year-and-a-half.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.229
[audience oohs]

12:13.649 --> 12:16.986
And you close your eyes, turn it on,
put it on your clitoris.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.196
[imitates vibrating]
Now you're fantasizing.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.240
You're naked, with Pegasus wings,

12:21.323 --> 12:23.325
flying through the clouds [whooshes]

12:23.451 --> 12:25.244
and clouds are hitting your coochie.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.747
-[laughter]
-'Oh, my God. Clouds on my coochie.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.790
The clouds on my coochie.'

12:29.874 --> 12:32.626
And then you look, and there's
little monkeys with Brad Pitt faces

12:32.710 --> 12:34.420
flying up to lick your coochie.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.046
[tongue trilling]

12:36.130 --> 12:39.049
'Oh my God, pussy-licking monkeys.
No, get away!

12:39.300 --> 12:40.468
[tongue trilling]

12:40.634 --> 12:43.512
Never! I love my husband!
I'll never let you lick my pussy!'

12:43.637 --> 12:44.597
[audience laughs]

12:45.139 --> 12:46.932
But there's thousands... [trilling]

12:47.183 --> 12:48.851
And they grab you and bite you...

12:48.976 --> 12:52.188
And they rip you to the ground,
'Honey, I tried! There's nothing...'

12:52.438 --> 12:55.274
[continued trilling]

12:57.485 --> 12:58.944
But this does it for you?"

12:59.653 --> 13:00.571
[audience whoos]

13:00.863 --> 13:01.906
She's lying!

13:01.989 --> 13:04.617
She's lying or she's a fucking loser.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.286
[audience and Robert laughing]

13:07.453 --> 13:08.913
If she's masturbating to me,

13:08.996 --> 13:11.999
Like, "Oh, my God, the roll
in the back of your neck. Oh, God.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.334
-[continued laughter]
-Oh my God.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.003
Oh, and your dead toenail. I can smell it.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.338
-I can smell it.
-[audience oohs]

13:17.421 --> 13:20.049
Where is it? Show me.
Oh, God, it looks like a corn chip.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.343
I'm going to fucking come right now."

13:22.426 --> 13:24.929
I should dump her.
She has no goals in life.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.305
[laughter]

13:26.514 --> 13:27.556
You guys have kids?

13:28.015 --> 13:29.099
-How many kids?
-[man] Two.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.059
Two.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.977
That's when sex falls the fuck off.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.064
I have a boy. I have one.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.482
Good-looking, too.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.983
Almost too good-looking.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.652
You know what I mean?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.737
For having a good-looking girl, it's okay.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.240
For a man to have a good-looking boy,
it's weird,

13:44.323 --> 13:48.285
'cause my alpha-male friends
say inappropriate shit all the time.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.080
I had one of my friends walk up,
he was like, "Dude, your kid...

13:51.580 --> 13:53.082
-gorgeous."
-[laughter]

13:53.249 --> 13:55.793
I'm like, "Thank you very much,
he's a good-looking kid."

13:56.168 --> 13:58.879
He goes, "No, dude,
it's gonna rain pussy on this kid."

13:59.004 --> 14:00.172
[audience oohs and laughs]

14:00.339 --> 14:02.842
"That's wildly inappropriate.
He's standing right here.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.802
This is... This is his birthday.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.012
-That's his grandmother. That's...
-[continued laughter]

14:07.096 --> 14:08.222
That's his grandfather."

14:08.973 --> 14:12.142
Then he goes like this. He goes,
"Dude, you better teach him now..."

14:12.226 --> 14:14.228
I'm like, "He's six!"
What do I... [laughs]

14:14.311 --> 14:17.106
What do I... What do I teach him?
"Son, lick lemons!"

14:17.648 --> 14:19.400
[audience laughs]

14:20.401 --> 14:21.235
"I don't like it."

14:21.318 --> 14:22.194
"Keep licking!"

14:24.530 --> 14:26.323
"Check for change in pay phones."

14:26.699 --> 14:28.701
[continued laughter]

14:32.121 --> 14:33.414
"There's nothing in here, Dad."

14:33.497 --> 14:35.332
"Keep checking, motherfucker!"

14:35.416 --> 14:37.376
[whooping]

14:39.128 --> 14:42.047
Then, when he's 18. "Dad, I'm in the limo,
what do I do with her?"

14:42.214 --> 14:44.592
[yelling] "Daniel<i>-san,</i> lick lemons!
[tongue trilling]

14:44.717 --> 14:46.176
Check for change!

14:46.427 --> 14:47.887
Sweep the clit!"

14:48.429 --> 14:49.346
<i>Hai!</i>

14:49.471 --> 14:51.473
[laughing]

14:51.849 --> 14:52.766
You...

14:53.517 --> 14:55.519
[audience cheers]

14:56.562 --> 14:57.771
Yeah, it's all done.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.275
Did you see the babies come out?

15:01.358 --> 15:03.360
Yeah. Yeah.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.030
That's when it changes.
That's when it kind of dies, right?

15:06.113 --> 15:06.989
[laughter]

15:07.156 --> 15:08.824
Watching a baby come out of a vagina,

15:09.408 --> 15:13.495
that's when a man finally realizes,
"Oh, a vagina is a baby door."

15:13.579 --> 15:14.496
That's...

15:14.663 --> 15:15.789
[laughter]

15:15.915 --> 15:19.418
Like a vagina... Her vagina to you
is for you to do fun shit with and...

15:19.501 --> 15:20.794
stick stuff in.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.087
-[tongue trilling]
-[laughter]

15:22.254 --> 15:24.882
He saw all kinds of stuff.
You know what I'm saying?

15:24.965 --> 15:28.093
I remember, I had my baby...
Eight weeks after we had the baby,

15:28.177 --> 15:29.803
My wife was like, "We should have sex."

15:29.887 --> 15:31.263
I was like, [stammers] "I'm good."

15:31.430 --> 15:32.473
[audience laughs]

15:32.640 --> 15:35.684
"I'm good for like a year,
maybe two years. I'm all right."

15:36.727 --> 15:38.062
She got mad as fuck, too.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.023
She was like, "We're having sex.
Get naked right now."

15:41.440 --> 15:44.151
Then we're just lying there naked.
I don't know what to do.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.070
-[laughing]
-She's like, "Play with my breasts."

15:46.153 --> 15:48.072
I'm like, "There's milk in them. No.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.366
I'm not hungry, first of all.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.617
[continued laughter]

15:51.825 --> 15:54.328
And I don't like the taste
of cereal milk, okay?"

15:54.411 --> 15:55.412
[cheering]

15:55.537 --> 15:58.624
That's what it tastes like. You didn't
know that, you little fucker, did you?

15:58.707 --> 16:00.793
-[audience laughs]
-Like Froot Loops, it's disgusting.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.672
She goes, "Well then go down on me."

16:04.755 --> 16:06.799
I'm like, [laughing]
"You're out of your fucking mind!

16:06.882 --> 16:09.385
You're crazy. You're a lunatic.
You're nuts!"

16:09.718 --> 16:12.221
She got mad, "Why?
Does my vagina disgust you

16:12.304 --> 16:14.056
'cause you saw a child come out of it?"

16:14.139 --> 16:17.643
I was like, "That is the exact
sentence I was going to fucking say!

16:17.726 --> 16:21.271
-[uproarious laughter]
-Yes! You fucking mental patient. Yes!

16:21.397 --> 16:24.525
I saw a head come
out of there eight weeks ago.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.945
And our kid was born with full hair!
A full set of hair.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.990
It looked like a little guy
working in your vagina.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.700
That fucked me up, I'm sorry.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.827
-I'm not fucking George Clooney.
-[continued laughter]

16:34.910 --> 16:37.079
Oh, and you pooed that night.
Did you know that?

16:37.162 --> 16:38.914
-I saw two births that night.
-[woman cackles]

16:38.998 --> 16:41.000
-A child and a tree trunk...
-[audience oohs]

shot out outta your asshole
and knocked the clock off the wall.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.755

16:47.297 --> 16:48.841
