<i> AND SPENCER?</i>

00:04.372 --> 00:05.537
ALI?

00:05.539 --> 00:07.373
SHE'S GONE.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.475
I THINK I HEARD HER SCREAM.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.543
<i> DID YOU SEE THE PAPER TODAY?</i>

00:11.545 --> 00:12.678
YEAH.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.446
SHE'S GONE,
BUT SHE'S EVERYWHERE.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.781
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT YOU.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.717
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT YOU TOO.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.587
<i> SO, I HEAR THE NEW</i>
<i> TEACHER IS REALLY HOT.</i>

00:23.591 --> 00:24.690
HOLY CRAP.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.058
( cell phone rings )

00:26.060 --> 00:28.694
<i> SOMEBODY LEFT A NOTE</i>
<i> IN MY LOCKER.</i>

00:28.696 --> 00:31.196
<i> FROM "A"?</i>
<i> DO YOU REALLY</i>
<i> THINK IT'S HER?</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:35.134
WE RECEIVED A CALL
FROM ROSEWOOD MALL
SECURITY.

00:35.136 --> 00:38.537
THEY HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER
ON TAPE SHOPLIFTING
A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.873
FIRST TIME?
YES.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.141
SO I'M CORRUPTING YOU.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.043
<i> WE'RE MEETING</i>

00:45.413 --> 00:46.912
THAT FEELS AWESOME.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.247
WE FOUND YOUR FRIEND.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.415
I KNEW SHE WAS BACK.
IS SHE INSIDE?

00:49.417 --> 00:50.416
EMILY.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.751
THEY FOUND ALISON'S BODY.

00:52.753 --> 00:53.752
<i> IT'S JENNA.</i>

00:55.322 --> 00:58.357
( cell phones ring
simultaneously )

00:58.359 --> 00:59.725
OH, MY GOD.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.727
IT'S FROM...

01:01.729 --> 01:02.895
I GOT ONE TOO.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.197
"I'M STILL HERE, BITCHES..."

01:05.199 --> 01:08.367
All: "...AND I KNOW
EVERYTHING. 'A.'"

01:14.175 --> 01:15.507
<i> ¶ THE CRADLE WAS DROPPED... ¶</i>

01:15.509 --> 01:17.876
WHY WAS JENNA THERE?

01:17.878 --> 01:19.578
I GUESS SHE'S BACK.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.381
THAT COP ACTED LIKE WE WERE
SUSPECTS OR SOMETHING.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.283
DO YOU THINK
WE LOOKED GUILTY?

01:24.285 --> 01:26.785
WHY WOULD WE?
WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.854
EXCEPT LIE ABOUT
THE JENNA THING.

01:28.856 --> 01:32.291
WE PROMISED WE'D NEVER
BRING UP THE JENNA THING
AGAIN, REMEMBER?

01:32.293 --> 01:33.759
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.095
HAVE YOU FOUND
A WAY TO FORGET?

01:36.097 --> 01:38.730
I STILL WAKE UP SOMETIMES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.598
IT WAS AN<i> ACCIDENT.</i>

01:43.270 --> 01:44.636
IT'S MEDICINAL.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.506
CRAMPS.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.809
I DON'T GET IT.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.779
HOW DOES "A" KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT ME
THAT ONLY ALISON KNEW?

01:53.781 --> 01:57.449
ALI KNEW ALL OF OUR
SECRETS, BUT...

01:57.451 --> 01:59.218
WE NEVER KNEW
ANY OF HERS.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.486
I KNEW SOME.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.687
GO ON.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.158
TALK.
I CAN'T.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.194
SPENCE! NO, YOU ARE NOT
GONNA DROP A BOMB LIKE THAT
AND JUST CLAM UP!

02:09.196 --> 02:11.130
SHE'D SO KILL ME
IF I TOLD YOU.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.364
SHE'S DEAD.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.636
ALI WAS SEEING
SOMEONE THAT SUMMER.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.272
I KNEW SHE WAS KEEPING
SOMETHING FROM ME...

02:20.274 --> 02:21.607
FROM US.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.042
WELL, WHY DIDN'T SHE
WANT US TO KNOW?

02:24.044 --> 02:26.945
HE WAS AN OLDER BOY,
AND HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

02:26.947 --> 02:27.946
WHO WAS IT?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.815
SHE NEVER TOLD ME
HIS NAME.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.650
THAT'S ONLY HALF THE SECRET.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.752
IT'S MORE THAN YOU
EVER GOT FROM HER.

02:33.754 --> 02:38.790
HOW IS THAT ALI
TOLD US NOTHING,
AND WE TOLD HER EVERYTHING?

02:38.792 --> 02:41.960
BECAUSE SHE MADE US FEEL
LIKE WE WERE PART OF
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.529
WE WERE.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.598
I MISS THAT.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.333
ME TOO.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.768
I MISS ALI.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.107
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU STILL WEAR THAT.

02:55.109 --> 02:57.843
ALI STILL WEARS HERS.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.344
WORE.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.180
WHEN ALI DIDN'T
COME HOME THAT NIGHT,

03:01.182 --> 03:04.049
I KNEW SOMETHING TERRIBLE
MUST HAVE HAPPENED,

03:04.051 --> 03:05.951
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS
SOME PART OF ME

03:05.953 --> 03:08.654
THAT IMAGINED SOMEDAY
SHE'D JUST SHOW UP.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.922
YEAH.

03:09.924 --> 03:12.491
I USED TO THINK THAT
MAYBE SHE'D JUST...

03:12.493 --> 03:14.693
RUN OFF WITH SOME GUY.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.895
SHE WAS LAYING
ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.898
OR GETTING A TAN
OUT BY THE POOL
WITH THAT HOT LIFEGUARD.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.334
OHH. YEAH...
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

03:22.336 --> 03:23.669
WHO CARES?

03:23.671 --> 03:26.138
"SAVE ME!"

03:26.140 --> 03:28.874

06:20.681 --> 06:23.482
IT'S A GOOD COLOR
FOR YOU.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.651
I HAD TO LOOK TWICE
TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS HANNA.

06:26.653 --> 06:27.819
RIGHT?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.354
THAT WAS<i> SOME</i>
FUNERAL DRESS.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.656

THAT FROM CURVY GIRL.

KNOW HER, AND IT DIDN'T...

IT'S WHERE PEOPLE COME
TO BE CLOSE TO HER.

09:09.182 --> 09:12.350
THEY LIGHT CANDLES
AND LEAVE TEDDY BEARS.

09:12.352 --> 09:16.154
I GET IT, BUT IT STILL
FEELS LIKE HER HOUSE.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.455
SURE.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.991
I CAN UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SPEND A FEW DAYS WITH US?

THIS ISN'T
AN EASY DECISION.

11:22.616 --> 11:26.284
BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.886
I CAN KEEP
MY FEELINGS IN CHECK.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.487
I CAN'T.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.323
AND EVEN IF I COULD,
I DON'T WANT TO.

11:32.325 --> 11:36.361
IT'S TOO HARD TO SIT
IN THIS ROOM EVERY DAY
AND CALL YOU MR. FITZ.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.433
OKAY? I CAN'T PRETEND
LIKE I DON'T KNOW YOU.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.304
SO...

11:47.741 --> 11:48.973
WILL YOU SIGN IT?

11:52.646 --> 11:54.379
ARE YOU SURE?

11:57.818 --> 11:59.050
YEAH, I'M... I'M SURE.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.564
THANK YOU.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.531
MM-HM.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.978
OKAY,

12:26.980 --> 12:28.480
I AM ALL FOR BOOB JOBS,

12:28.482 --> 12:30.682
BUT WHEN I SEE THOSE,
I WANT TO "MOO."

12:30.684 --> 12:33.017
( both chuckle )

12:33.019 --> 12:34.853
I SPY A SEAN.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.187
I'LL SEE YOU AT LUNCH.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.766
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU SURPRISED ME.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.734
WE STILL ON FOR THE MOVIE?

12:49.736 --> 12:52.971
MY MOM INVITED MAYA
TO STAY WITH US TONIGHT.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.074
OHH... WHAT KIND OF JAMMIES
DO YOU THINK NEW GIRL WEARS?

12:56.076 --> 12:57.876
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

12:57.878 --> 12:59.611
I'LL SEE YOU AT PRACTICE.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.553
Woman on P.A.:
<i> WILL THE FOLLOWING STUDENTS</i>

13:08.555 --> 13:10.688
<i> PLEASE COME TO THE OFFICE--</i>

13:10.690 --> 13:12.490

13:14.394 --> 13:16.528

13:16.530 --> 13:18.663
<i> HANNA MARIN.</i>

13:18.665 --> 13:20.265
( class bell rings )

13:20.267 --> 13:21.499
( cell phone chimes )

13:23.904 --> 13:24.903
WAIT.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.306
IT'S FROM "A."

13:31.478 --> 13:33.144
"DEAD GIRLS WALKING."

13:54.234 --> 13:56.201
( sighs )
SO LET'S SEE...

13:58.438 --> 14:00.205
YOU THOUGHT
YOU HEARD HER SCREAM.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.640
I-I SAID THAT, YEAH.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.142
AND WHEN YOU THREE
WOKE UP

14:04.144 --> 14:06.144
IN THE BARN,
ALISON WAS GONE,

14:06.146 --> 14:07.745
AND SO WAS SPENCER.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.247
YES, I WOKE UP BEFORE THEM,

14:09.249 --> 14:11.950
AND I REALIZED THAT
ALI WAS MISSING, SO...

14:11.952 --> 14:13.852
SO YOU WENT
LOOKING FOR HER.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.788
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.623
I GOT THAT.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.626
SO, WHAT'S UP? WAS THIS
A SLUMBER PARTY, OR...?

14:21.628 --> 14:23.061
IS THIS AN INTERROGATION?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.029
NO, JUST A ROUTINE
FOLLOW-UP.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.267
WHY DID YOU GUYS
ALL FALL ASLEEP?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.436
I GUESS WE WERE TIRED.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.470
TIRED?

14:32.472 --> 14:33.438
REALLY.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.109
IS THAT HOW YOU
REMEMBER IT, HANNA?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.844
YEAH.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.346
YEAH, YOU GUYS
WERE TIRED.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.047
LOOK, WE'VE TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING WE KNOW,

14:43.049 --> 14:45.483
JUST LIKE WE DID
THE NIGHT SHE WENT MISSING.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.018
I KNOW, AND YOU SEE,
THE THING IS,

14:47.020 --> 14:49.821
IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SAID LAST YEAR--

14:49.823 --> 14:51.556
ALMOST LIKE IT WAS REHEARSED.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.227
LIKE SPENCER SAID,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.196
WE'VE TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING WE KNOW.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.500
HE KNOWS WE'RE LYING.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.168
LYING IS NOT A CRIME.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.304
IT IS WHEN YOU'RE GIVING
FALSE STATEMENTS TO
THE POLICE.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.473
IT'S CALLED
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.275
OH, PLEASE!
WE LIED ABOUT DRINKING.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.610
BUT THE TRUTH THAT MATTERS
IS WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

15:12.612 --> 15:13.978
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALI THAT NIGHT.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.280
WE ALSO KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE

15:15.282 --> 15:17.048
WHO MIGHT HAVE
WANTED TO HURT HER.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.983
WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD
THE POLICE THE TRUTH
ABOUT JENNA'S ACCIDENT

15:18.985 --> 15:20.251
THE NIGHT IT HAPPENED.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.920
<i> I</i> WANTED TO, REMEMBER?

15:21.922 --> 15:24.689
WE HAD A CHANCE TO DO MORE
THAN JUST TELL THE TRUTH.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.357
WE HAD A CHANCE TO STOP ALI.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.026
BUT WE DIDN'T.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.528
AND TELLING THE POLICE NOW
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO JENNA

15:30.530 --> 15:32.363
ISN'T GOING
TO MAKE HER SEE AGAIN.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.265
IT'LL JUST RUIN OUR LIVES.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.005
OH, MY GOD,
SHE'S BACK IN SCHOOL TOO?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.682
JENNA?

15:50.684 --> 15:52.850
HEY, IT'S--
IT'S ARIA.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.420
DO YOU... WANT
TO COME SIT WITH US?

15:57.824 --> 16:00.024
SURE.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.166
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE
BETWEEN HANNA AND EMILY,

16:08.168 --> 16:10.702
AND SPENCER'S
RIGHT ACROSS FROM YOU.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.206
Jenna: THANK YOU.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.241
YEAH. AND HERE'S A CHAIR.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.576
SO...

16:18.578 --> 16:21.079
THIS WOULD BE ALISON'S
CHAIR, RIGHT?

16:21.081 --> 16:24.549
NO. WE'RE NOT EVEN
SITTING AT THAT TABLE.

16:24.551 --> 16:28.019
YOU KNOW, SHE CAME
TO VISIT ME IN THE HOSPITAL
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.354
ALISON DID?

16:29.356 --> 16:31.889
MM-HM.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.391
EVERYONE MISUNDERSTOOD ALISON,

16:33.393 --> 16:35.293
BUT I KNEW
EXACTLY WHO SHE WAS.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.396
WHEN DID YOU
GET BACK, JENNA?

16:38.398 --> 16:40.531
WE HEARD THAT YOU WERE
IN PHILADELPHIA,

16:40.533 --> 16:43.134
A SCHOOL FOR THE...
VISUALLY IMPAIRED.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.870
YOU CAN SAY "BLIND,"
SPENCER.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.905
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.079
WOW.

16:55.081 --> 16:58.249
IT'S SO QUIET.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.617
YOU GUYS USED TO BE
THE FUN TABLE.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.857
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU GIRLS?

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

17:35.522 --> 17:37.021
WHO WAS IT, ALI?
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

17:37.023 --> 17:39.023
HE WAS IN THAT TREE,
SPYING ON US!

17:39.025 --> 17:41.259
I AM SO CREEPED OUT!
WHO WAS IT?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.593
IT WAS THAT PERV,
TOBY CAVANAUGH.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.795
ARE YOU SURE?
YES, I'M SURE!

17:43.797 --> 17:45.797
HE WAS RIGHT THERE!

17:45.799 --> 17:47.465
I BET HE SAW US ALL NAKED.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.068
SHOULD WE TELL SOMEONE?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.769
I MEAN, WE COULD.

HE'S<i> NOT,</i> OKAY?

18:05.718 --> 18:08.219
YOU'VE GOT THE LIGHTER,
RIGHT, SPENCER?

18:08.221 --> 18:09.821
LET'S WAIT A SECOND.

18:09.823 --> 18:10.922
WHAT, EMILY?

18:10.924 --> 18:12.723
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
FINE.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.991
GO BACK.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.027
OKAY, MAYBE EMILY'S RIGHT.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.162
WE SHOULD JUST CALL THE COPS.
THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT?

18:21.101 --> 18:23.668
GIRLS, TOBY CAVANAUGH
IS A FREAK,

18:23.670 --> 18:25.536
AND WE NEED
TO TEACH HIM A LESSON.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.205
IF HE THINKS HE CAN COME
AND SPY ON US

18:27.207 --> 18:28.606
WHILE WE'RE IN YOUR
BEDROOM, EMILY,

18:28.608 --> 18:30.374

THAT HIS LITTLE DOMAIN

IN THERE ALL DAY,
THAT LITTLE FREAK.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.048
ARE YOU SURE
THAT IT WAS TOBY?

18:37.050 --> 18:39.383
YES! AND IT'S A STINK BOMB,

20:36.936 --> 20:39.870

SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT,

22:45.365 --> 22:47.264

YOUR DAD?

22:47.266 --> 22:48.766
NO, IT'S ME. IT'S...

24:21.360 --> 24:24.862
I'D SAY ON A SCALE

24:24.864 --> 24:25.963

IS THAT THE NEW FIANCé?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.736
IS HE AS
UPTIGHT AS MELISSA?

24:32.738 --> 24:35.439
NO ONE'S AS UPTIGHT
AS MELISSA.

24:35.441 --> 24:36.340
( both chuckle )

24:37.910 --> 24:39.243
I'D BETTER GET BACK.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.445
All right. See ya.

24:41.447 --> 24:42.480
Yeah. Thank you.

24:44.517 --> 24:45.950
CAN I GET ANYONE A DRINK?

24:45.952 --> 24:48.118
I'LL HAVE A VODKA SODA.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.787

24:49.789 --> 24:52.389

OF THE HOUSE CAB.

24:52.391 --> 24:53.557
MELISSA?

24:53.559 --> 24:55.226
THE SAME AS MY FATHER.

24:55.228 --> 24:57.194
I ACTUALLY WILL HAVE
A VODKA SODA.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.067
SO I GET YOUR CONNECTION
TO SPENCER.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.568
YOU BOTH LIKE TO WIN.

25:04.570 --> 25:07.905

BUT IF I'VE DONE MY BEST,

25:07.907 --> 25:10.574

ABOUT THE OUTCOME,
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS.

25:10.576 --> 25:11.842

25:11.844 --> 25:13.143
SPENCER<i> NEEDS</i> TO WIN.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.583

THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.987

ANYONE LIKE THAT?

25:22.989 --> 25:24.989

FROM THOSE GIRLS.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.995
Peter: YOU'LL CATCH ON.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.764
I'LL GO FIRST.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.832

FIRST WEEK OF CLASS,

26:08.834 --> 26:11.635

BEEN NOMINATED TO SERVE

26:11.637 --> 26:14.271

LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.340
MELISSA LIKES
TO PLAY THE GAME

26:16.342 --> 26:17.808
WHEN SHE'S FAIRLY
CERTAIN SHE'LL WIN.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.311
GUESS WHO I LEARNED
<i> THAT</i> FROM?

26:20.313 --> 26:22.346
DON'T GO TASTING
VICTORY JUST YET.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.715
THE JUDGE RULED
ON MY BRIEF TODAY,

26:24.717 --> 26:26.951
AND THE CLASS ACTION SUIT
AGAINST WINSLOW

26:26.953 --> 26:28.552
HAS BEEN DISMISSED.

26:28.554 --> 26:29.920
OH.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.324

DO I STILL GET ANOTHER DRINK?

26:33.326 --> 26:35.526

PARKING SPOT TODAY,

WITH EMILY THAN I HAVE.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.509

28:32.511 --> 28:35.412
GOOD GIRLS
DON'T KISS AND TELL.

28:35.414 --> 28:36.780
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME
AS A GOOD GIRL.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.482

28:38.484 --> 28:41.485

GET MUCH SLEEP?

33:28.173 --> 33:30.574
SO I DON'T KNOW
THAT KIND OF PRESSURE,

33:30.576 --> 33:33.510

UNBEARABLE AT TIMES.

WITH THE DRESS?

35:24.156 --> 35:25.822

39:31.169 --> 39:32.435
WERE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER?

39:33.972 --> 39:36.840
I HAD VERY STRONG
FEELINGS FOR MEREDITH,

39:36.842 --> 39:41.010
AND MY ATTRACTION TO HER
TOOK ME COMPLETELY
BY SURPRISE.

39:41.012 --> 39:45.148
I HAD NO INTENTION
OF BEING UNFAITHFUL
TO YOUR MOTHER.

39:45.150 --> 39:49.886
AND YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO UNDERSTAND THIS, BUT...

39:49.888 --> 39:52.389
THE TRUTH IS, I...

39:52.391 --> 39:53.890
GAVE IN TO MY EMOTIONS.

39:58.330 --> 40:00.964
( door opens )

40:04.202 --> 40:06.903
MR. CHUNG WAS
VERY HAPPY TO SEE US.

40:06.905 --> 40:10.206
FROM THE LOOKS
OF ALL OF THIS FOOD,

40:10.208 --> 40:12.876
I'M SURE THAT HE WAS.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.310
WE GOT YOU KUNG PAO.

40:14.312 --> 40:16.813
YOU'RE... YOU'RE NOT
GOING OUT TONIGHT?

40:18.784 --> 40:20.316
NO.

40:20.318 --> 40:21.551
NO, I THINK I'LL STAY HOME.

40:24.823 --> 40:25.889
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.827
IS THIS GOOD?
MM, YEAH.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.163
YOU WANT SOME?
YEAH, THANKS.

40:33.165 --> 40:35.331
I'M GONNA GO
GET OUT OF THESE
WET CLOTHES, OKAY?

40:39.237 --> 40:40.837
IS IT GOOD?

40:40.839 --> 40:42.405
TRY THIS?
Ella: NO, THANKS. I'M GOOD.

40:42.407 --> 40:43.740
YOU'RE GOOD?
I'M GOOD.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.475
YOU'RE SURE?
I AM GOOD.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.977
I THINK I GOT
TOO MUCH FOOD.
THAT'S FINE.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.712
I TOLD YOU, MR. CHUNG
WAS VERY HAPPY.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.952
( indistinct
happy chatter )
