00:12.012 --> 00:13.665
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.798
Hey.
Hey.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.758
Look at them all, Leo.

00:19.932 --> 00:23.588
Without knowing why, things
just seem better to them.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.764
Even though they
don't yet realize

00:25.938 --> 00:28.289
that everything
is different.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.987
Of course there will
be a transitional period.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.945
But soon, they will
begin to understand

00:33.120 --> 00:36.384
that they no longer
have to worry about evil,
security, conflict.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.125
That this world is
here to stay.

00:38.299 --> 00:40.518
ALPHA:
Is it not what we spoke of, Leo?

00:40.692 --> 00:42.042
LEO:
It's impressive.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.609
And you know, the only
threat to Utopia,

00:44.783 --> 00:48.352
to all that we've
created here is conflict.

00:48.526 --> 00:53.618
And that, Leo, we
simply cannot abide.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.230
I don't know, it's just the way
the sisters reacted,

00:56.404 --> 00:57.709
especially Paige.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.798
She grieves.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.235
I know, but...

01:01.409 --> 01:02.888
not the way
she's supposed to.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.499
It's just...

01:04.673 --> 01:06.718
it doesn't seem right.

01:06.892 --> 01:09.460
Well, things are different,
Leo, to be sure.

01:09.634 --> 01:12.724
But look around you now.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.814
Is not everyone better off?

01:15.988 --> 01:18.556
Are not the sisters
better off?

01:18.730 --> 01:20.689
I don't know.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.995
Then you must go
to them, Leo.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.997
They're the people who
mean the most to you.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.652
See for yourself.
Understand.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.567
It's all good, Leo.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.961
It's all genuine.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.963
But once you're
satisfied,

01:34.137 --> 01:35.704
it is important that
you return to us.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.619
Important, why?

01:37.793 --> 01:39.534
After the death of
one of our own,

01:39.708 --> 01:42.058
the collective has been
drained of power.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.755
You feel it, too,
do you not?

01:43.929 --> 01:45.757
Yes.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.455
And so the sooner
you're reassured,

01:47.629 --> 01:50.762
satisfied...
the sooner you can join us,

01:50.936 --> 01:53.548
and help us maintain
all of this.

01:53.722 --> 01:54.897
We have much work

01:55.071 --> 01:56.594
to do, Leo.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.248
What kind of work?

01:58.422 --> 01:59.423
You'll see.

01:59.597 --> 02:00.946
When you're ready,

02:01.121 --> 02:03.297
you'll sense where to find us.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.391
MAN:
Please calm
down, sir.

02:10.565 --> 02:11.870
Harold, get back
in the car.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.263
I'm telling you, the light
was yellow,

02:13.437 --> 02:15.004
just like last time!
What, do you guys

02:15.178 --> 02:16.136
have it out for me?!Harold, please!

02:16.310 --> 02:17.398
No!
This is ridiculous!

02:17.572 --> 02:18.529
It's police harassment!

02:18.703 --> 02:19.530
I want your name

Uh, butter?

04:26.309 --> 04:27.571
Hey, you're breaking
the flow. Move it.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.225
Sorry.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.487
Where you been?LEO:
With the other Avatars,

04:30.661 --> 04:31.619
making sure everything
went all right.

04:31.793 --> 04:32.794
Why wouldn't it be?

04:32.968 --> 04:33.838
You tell me.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.057
How you guys doing?

04:35.231 --> 04:36.928
Are you kidding?
I feel great.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.061
Better than I have, in God,
I don't even know how long.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.019
Six and a half years,
but who's counting?

04:41.193 --> 04:43.544
Of course we haven't been out
in the real world yet, but...

04:43.718 --> 04:45.502
PIPER:
If it feels anything
like it does in here...

04:45.676 --> 04:47.939
Then we have
no complaints.
None.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.114
Actually we're
gonna celebrate.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.072
We're gonna have
a little party.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.726
A party? Today?

04:51.900 --> 04:52.814
Yeah, why not?

04:52.988 --> 04:54.511
I don't know, maybe you just...

04:54.685 --> 04:55.860
wanted to make sure that
everything worked all right.

04:56.034 --> 04:56.948
PHOEBE:
Leo, it works...

04:57.122 --> 04:58.559
better than we expected.

04:58.733 --> 04:59.951
Besides, we have a lot
of catching up to do,

05:00.125 --> 05:01.213
especially with our friends.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.954
PIPER:
Yeah, I'm a little
nervous.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.869
I'm not sure I know how to
socialize with normal people.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.480
Oh, you'll be fine.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.046
Especially since no demons
will be attacking.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.396
They're still out there.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.353
Yeah, but they won't
be attacking.

05:10.527 --> 05:11.354
They're all on the run.

05:11.528 --> 05:12.834
Come on, just enjoy it.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.358
We have you to thank
for all this.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.404
How's Paige?

05:17.578 --> 05:18.883
Better, I think.

05:19.057 --> 05:19.971
It's gonna take her
some time, though.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.712
Kyle meant
a lot to her.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.845
But it does help her to know
that he's gone on

05:24.019 --> 05:24.976
to a better place.Absolutely.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.674
Is she upstairs?

05:26.848 --> 05:28.545
She's at Kyle's apartment
getting some stuff.

05:28.719 --> 05:32.027
And I think I'm gonna go to work
and check out the real world.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.115
All right, well,
I'm gonna

05:33.289 --> 05:35.291
go check on Paige.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.989
Okay, you two,
but don't be late.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.750
Hey, how you holding up?

05:59.924 --> 06:02.144
Good, considering.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.973
I'm not really sure what to do
with all of his stuff, though.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.583
That's not really your
responsibility, is it?

06:06.757 --> 06:07.845
Well, no,

06:08.019 --> 06:09.717
but he doesn't
have a family.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.936
It's just so...

06:12.110 --> 06:13.329
odd that he's gone.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.200
I really miss him.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.376
Good.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.465
I... I mean, it's normal.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.031
You don't want to go around

06:20.205 --> 06:21.772
just having it all be glossed
over, you know.

06:21.946 --> 06:22.947
No.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.950
But still, I am happy for him.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.256
I mean he is in

06:27.430 --> 06:28.257
a better place.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.128
And the thing is,

06:30.302 --> 06:34.437
he would really want me to enjoy
this new world.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.091
Well, he died trying to stop it.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.223
Well, that's why I owe it to him
to be happy.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.617
Of course.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.706
Hey, I have to go home
and get ready for the party.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.751
You gonna come?

06:43.925 --> 06:45.535
I think so.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.451
Great.
I will see you there, sir.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.506
[rumbling]

07:01.595 --> 07:03.466
[groans]

07:07.035 --> 07:08.340
You've been weakened, Avatar,

07:08.515 --> 07:09.777
by the death

07:09.951 --> 07:11.953
of one of your own.

07:18.873 --> 07:21.702
We both have the same problem,
you and I.

07:21.876 --> 07:25.096
Neither of us trusts
this new world.

07:25.270 --> 07:28.186
We're both gonna have
to do something about it.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.148
ELISE:
Phoebe, what are you
doing here?

07:33.322 --> 07:34.758
I thought it was your day off.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.891
Oh, I just came by to see
how things were going.

07:37.065 --> 07:37.979
How are things going?

07:38.153 --> 07:39.546
They aren't.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.243
And that's good.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.810
Have you seen today's paper?

07:42.984 --> 07:45.552
Thinnest one we've ever had.

07:45.726 --> 07:48.555
There's no crime to speak of,
no corruption, no scandal...

07:48.729 --> 07:51.732
it's like people have been
taking happy pills.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.081
Thank God the obits are up,

07:53.255 --> 07:54.386
otherwise we'd just have
a one sheet.

07:54.561 --> 07:55.431
So maybe things are

07:55.605 --> 07:56.824
just getting better, huh?

07:56.998 --> 07:58.739
Oh, I'm all for that.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.828
But I've been working here
so long, I don't believe it.

08:01.002 --> 08:01.872
Something always happens.

08:02.046 --> 08:02.917
Maybe.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.440
Or maybe it's a shame

08:04.614 --> 08:06.964
when we don't trust when good
things happen.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.705
What a nice thought.

08:08.879 --> 08:12.056
Now you should write about
that in your next column.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.884
Best advice you could
give your readers.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.930
Okay, but I gotta
go home to do it.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.279
Tell Oliver I'll e-mail

08:17.453 --> 08:18.410
it to him
around six'ish, okay?

08:18.585 --> 08:19.890
Oliver...

08:20.064 --> 08:21.892
That's the only bad thing
that happened today.

08:22.066 --> 08:25.505
Well, not bad for him
of course, just for us.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.115
What happened?

08:27.289 --> 08:29.683
Oh, I got a call from
his family about an hour ago.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.423
He's gone. It happened
early this morning.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.556
Oh, my God.

08:33.730 --> 08:34.992
He was such a troubled
young man.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.603
I really hoped he
could turn things around.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.779
Yeah, me, too.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.563
Well, at least we can take heart

08:40.737 --> 08:42.434
that he's in a much
better place now.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.134
Yeah.

08:46.308 --> 08:48.353
I guess so.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.313
Mind telling me
where we are?

08:51.487 --> 08:54.795
An ancient tomb in an
ancient pyramid

08:54.969 --> 08:57.406
where no one, especially not the
Avatars, are gonna look for us.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.364
Why bring me here?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.931
To show you the truth.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.411
To show you why
you never

09:02.585 --> 09:04.195
should have turned
your back on the Elders.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.849
And to decide whether

09:06.023 --> 09:08.112
or not you're willing
to help me stop the Avatars.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.723
Why would I help a demon?

09:09.897 --> 09:11.812
Because it is by far
the better of your options.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.161
You could either work

09:13.335 --> 09:15.119
to change things back,

09:15.293 --> 09:17.774
or you can repeat
the mistakes of the past.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.084
The Avatars were here before,
thousands of years ago,

09:23.258 --> 09:24.085
when people believed

09:24.259 --> 09:26.435
in magic and demons.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.351
The Avatars promised
to rid them of evil.

09:29.525 --> 09:34.312
On that level, same as now, they
were more or less successful.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.227
They remade the world.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.578
But they never told people
of the ultimate cost.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.928
Who's that, the dog-headed
figure, is that a demon?

09:41.102 --> 09:42.930
Oh, actually that's
a jackal's head.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.367
He is Anubis--
the Egyptian guardian

09:45.541 --> 09:47.021
and protector of the dead.

09:47.195 --> 09:51.678
There's a price
to pay for Utopia.

09:51.852 --> 09:55.986
A price that you suspect,
but don't yet know about.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.771
They knew about it, though.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.642
And they rose up
against the Avatars,

09:59.816 --> 10:01.775
and stopped them the first
time for good reason.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.559
Maybe so, but I never...

10:03.733 --> 10:06.083
Agent Brody realized the danger
that the Avatars pose, too.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.695
That's why he was willing
to help me weaken them

10:08.869 --> 10:10.305
so that I could bring you here,

10:10.479 --> 10:12.612
so that you could help.

10:12.786 --> 10:15.005
He was willing to sacrifice
everything to stop them.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.268
Brody was crazy.Brody was right.

10:18.443 --> 10:21.011
You know deep down

10:21.185 --> 10:25.146
that there is something very
wrong with this world, Leo.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.279
Something you never foresaw
in your own myopic zeal

10:28.453 --> 10:29.629
to try and make it all better.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.587
People have no free will
anymore.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.720
At least not completely.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.679
The Avatars now dictate
their destinies.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.507
And you...

10:38.681 --> 10:40.335
let it happen.

10:40.509 --> 10:43.294
The question is,
are you willing to fix it?To do what?

10:43.468 --> 10:45.383
Get back what we had before?

10:45.557 --> 10:47.124
Fight your kind again?

10:47.298 --> 10:49.692
Well, nobody said the system
was perfect, did they?

10:49.866 --> 10:51.172
But it's better than this,
isn't it?

10:52.564 --> 10:54.479
You decide for yourself,
but decide soon.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.785
If we have to work together,

10:55.959 --> 10:57.265
we're gonna have
to move quickly.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.892
Ah, Leo.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.067
Welcome.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.329
How are the sisters?

11:18.503 --> 11:20.157
Content, I trust?

11:20.331 --> 11:21.550
They seemed okay.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.292
What is this place?

11:24.466 --> 11:27.817
This is where
we maintain Utopia.

11:28.949 --> 11:29.732
Come.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.957
These are the others.

11:37.131 --> 11:40.787
You've felt them,
though you haven't yet met.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.571
What are they doing?

11:42.745 --> 11:45.487
Monitoring
for conflict.

11:45.661 --> 11:48.272
[faint shouting]

11:54.844 --> 11:55.889
I don't understand.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.587
In bringing this all about,

11:58.761 --> 12:00.197
we've modified

12:00.371 --> 12:03.026
the way people think,
their belief systems,

12:03.200 --> 12:06.900
so that they can more
easily accept a world
without evil,

12:07.074 --> 12:09.729
so that they wouldn't
keep looking for it.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.731
And so that
the demons who remain

12:11.905 --> 12:13.602
couldn't influence them
into evil acts.

12:13.776 --> 12:17.127
Unfortunately, however, some
have already been damaged

12:17.301 --> 12:18.999
beyond hope.

12:19.173 --> 12:22.393
Their inner demons
sometimes surface,

12:22.567 --> 12:25.266
causing... conflict.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.616
GAMMA:
And when that
conflict passes

12:27.790 --> 12:30.271
a certain threshold,
we must deal with it.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.447
To protect Utopia.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.449
[faint shouting]

12:41.935 --> 12:45.765
[grunting]

12:50.117 --> 12:52.467
[indistinct conversation]

12:52.641 --> 12:54.034
LEO:
Wait!

12:54.208 --> 12:55.078
You killed them.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.080
We removed them.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.386
The one for the many.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.257
We have an obligation

13:00.431 --> 13:03.086
to maintain the world
that we've created, Leo.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.741
We can't let anything
threaten it...

13:05.915 --> 13:07.743
and we won't.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.932
Oh, wow.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.325
Wow!

13:24.499 --> 13:25.761
Ooh!
No, no!

13:25.935 --> 13:27.371
No, no touchie touchie.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.460
I just want to make
sure it's not poisoned.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.288
No. I want everything
to be perfect.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.334
We've waited a long time
for this day.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.597
Piper, everything
isperfect--
it looks amazing.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.252
I can't believe you did
all this since I left.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.123
Well, when I'm not mixing
vanquishing potions

13:40.297 --> 13:42.952
all the time, I tend
to get a lot more done.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.736
I forgot how much
I like coking.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.521
We're all good.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.045
Yeah, as long as Leo
makes it to the party.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.004
I thought he was just going
over to Paige's.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.093
I did, too,
but she came back without him,

13:53.267 --> 13:54.572
and now she's upstairs
getting ready.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.618
Well, maybe he had
some Avatar stuff to do?

13:56.792 --> 13:59.926
Hm. I hope the Avatars
don't keep him as busy

14:00.100 --> 14:01.884
as the Elders did.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.234
I don't think he'd put up with
that, Piper, and you know it.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.193
He created this
better world so that

14:06.367 --> 14:08.717
you guys could be
together again-- as a family.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.632
Still, I worry.

14:10.806 --> 14:14.201
And next to cooking, that's
the second thing you do best.

14:15.724 --> 14:16.943
Hey.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.380
Hey. How you doing?

14:19.554 --> 14:21.556
Better. Thanks.

14:21.730 --> 14:24.559
Yeah, I am really
looking forward to this party.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.735
You know,
take my mind off stuff?

14:26.909 --> 14:29.956
I just need to remind myself
Kyle's in a better place, right?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.915
Yeah. That's what I have
to remind myself.

14:34.134 --> 14:37.485
This guy at work, he...
just went away.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.966
It was really unexpected.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.576
PIPER:
Well, I'm sure
it must all be

14:41.750 --> 14:42.925
for the best, you know--

14:43.099 --> 14:43.926
otherwise it
wouldn't have happened.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.973
Right.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.539
Well, anyway, why don't you
go help the kids get dressed?

14:48.713 --> 14:49.932
Their clothes
are laid out.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.542
And you can help
me in the kitchen.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.718
Come on, chop-chop,
we have a party to throw.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.421
I'm concentrating.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.075
Yes, I'm sorry.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.250
This is important.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.729
So is this.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.557
Somewhere in these
drawings is the key

15:06.731 --> 15:08.951
to the potion Brody used
against the Avatars.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.302
Well, I'm glad to see that
you're using your energy wisely.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.914
But... some of the others
are restless.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.438
They don't want to sit around
and die like dogs

15:17.612 --> 15:20.093
while we wait around
for the help of someone good.

15:20.267 --> 15:23.574
Are you questioning
my plan?

15:23.748 --> 15:25.315
No. Not at all.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.926
Zankou, we're demons!

15:27.100 --> 15:28.623
We need to stand up

15:28.797 --> 15:30.103
and fight them
on our own.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.801
Not just sit around and wait.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.542
That's just the point.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.110
We can't fight on our own;
we don't have the power.

15:37.284 --> 15:38.807
Like it or not,

15:38.981 --> 15:40.678
our fate rests with Leo.

15:40.852 --> 15:41.941
Oh, yeah?

15:42.115 --> 15:43.420
Then we'd rather die

15:43.594 --> 15:45.727
than leave our trust
in the hands of an Elder.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.120
Then we will surely die.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.774
You tell the others

15:49.949 --> 15:52.603
that they do as I
say when I say it,

15:52.777 --> 15:56.216
or the Avatars will be the
least of their problems,
do you understand me?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.261
Yes.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.134
Now, leave. He's coming.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.877
Welcome back, partner.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.575
We're not partners.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.230
Oh, no? Then what
are you doing here?

16:10.404 --> 16:11.927
I'm still not so sure.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.625
Ah, yes, you are--
you may not want to be sure,

16:14.799 --> 16:16.453
but that doesn't change the fact

16:16.627 --> 16:19.413
that everything I told you about
your precious Avatars is true.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.415
And now you want to stop them
just as much as I do.

16:21.589 --> 16:24.418
I'm not so eager to bring
demons back into the world.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.246
Ah, but there's the rub.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.987
Which world is worse?

16:28.161 --> 16:29.684
Which is the greater evil,

16:29.858 --> 16:31.381
mine or theirs?

16:31.555 --> 16:33.253
I know taking destiny
out of people's hands

16:33.427 --> 16:34.732
is not right, no matter what.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.560
I couldn't agree more.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.214
Let's make something clear.

16:38.388 --> 16:41.174
If we succeed,
we'll still be enemies,

16:41.348 --> 16:45.265
and I can make you a
promise it will only
be a matter of time

16:45.439 --> 16:46.875
before good defeats evil.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.530
Well, we'll have to see
about that, won't we?

16:49.704 --> 16:51.227
Now, if we're finished

16:51.401 --> 16:54.970
with the macho posturing,
let's get to work.

16:56.798 --> 16:59.105
The problem is, even
if I decipher these,

16:59.279 --> 17:00.976
we're still gonna
need the Charmed Ones

17:01.150 --> 17:02.412
to actually prepare
the potion.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.197
They won't go
against the Avatars.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.589
They wanted this world.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.678
Not if they discover
the catch,

17:07.852 --> 17:10.768
not if they realize that
the Avatars alone decide
who lives or dies.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.248
Now, of course,
you know

17:12.422 --> 17:14.642
the sisters better
than I do, but...

17:14.816 --> 17:16.731
I doubt even they want that.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.863
Which means
you're gonna have

17:19.038 --> 17:23.042
to get them to see
what the Avatars don't
want them to see...

17:23.216 --> 17:26.610
even if it will take
you shocking them with
another terrible loss.

17:30.614 --> 17:33.313
Okay, you wait there.

17:33.487 --> 17:37.534
We are gonna have
so much fun today!

17:37.708 --> 17:40.407
You're gonna meet so many
new friends at the party.

17:40.581 --> 17:43.149
But you can't orb, okay?
You have to promise me.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.585
We don't want to scare

17:44.759 --> 17:46.326
the guests away, got it?

17:47.805 --> 17:49.764
Like that.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.331
Phoebe, we need to talk.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.855
Yeah, you need to get ready
for the party

17:54.029 --> 17:55.944
before your wife kills you.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.599
Figuratively speaking,
of course.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.818
See, that right there,
that's what I'm talking about.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.951
What are you saying?I'm talking about the fact
that what you said,

18:03.125 --> 18:05.040
you felt like
you had to qualify it.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.607
Qualify what?I'm talking about the Avatars
and what they've

18:06.781 --> 18:08.609
done to you,
what they've done to everybody.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.264
They've made everything better;  you'vemade everything better.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.222
No. That was a mistake, okay?

18:13.396 --> 18:15.442
And I realize that
now, and I need you
to realize that, too,

18:15.616 --> 18:16.834
before what happens to Brody

18:17.008 --> 18:18.358
happens to somebody else
we care about.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.360
Leo, you're scaring me.Good.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.188
You need to be scared,
because it's the only way

18:22.362 --> 18:23.624
you're gonna understand
the truth,

18:23.798 --> 18:25.147
the only way you're gonna
be able to feel it.

18:25.321 --> 18:26.844
And you can help Piper and Paige
understand, too.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.151
You can use your powers
to feel the loss,

18:29.325 --> 18:31.632
to see that what
the Avatars are doing is wrong.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.416
Leo, this is what we allwanted.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.591
What's going on?

18:34.765 --> 18:37.116
[exhales]

18:39.118 --> 18:40.989
You'll see.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.252
What... What
are you doing?

18:45.602 --> 18:47.517
Leo, you can't just...

18:49.693 --> 18:51.434
Well, what are
we doing here?

18:51.608 --> 18:54.568
I need you to get a vision--
I need you to see

18:54.742 --> 18:56.004
what really happened
to Agent Brody.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.701
I know what really
happened to him--

18:57.875 --> 19:00.313
he's moved on to
a better place.
Maybe so.

19:00.487 --> 19:03.403
But it doesn't change the fact
that somebody killed him.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.361
Well...

19:05.535 --> 19:07.537
[sighs]

19:19.549 --> 19:20.724
Oh, my God.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.770
She killed him.
Yes.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.685
The Avatars don't want you
to know that, Phoebe.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.122
They don't want you
to know why people
just suddenly disappear.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.951
Leo, why are
you doing this?Because it's the truth, Phoebe.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.475
They changed you so you couldn't
feel the true pain of death.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.651
They want it to seem
like it's a good thing,

19:34.825 --> 19:36.914
so the next time it happens
you don't even question it.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.526
No.Yes, and it's gonna
happen again, Phoebe.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.092
Soon as they decide
somebody in the world

19:41.267 --> 19:42.703
is creating too much conflict.

19:42.877 --> 19:46.359
Leo, we're not going back
to the way it was.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.143
Okay? We tried it
for seven years,

19:48.317 --> 19:49.362
and it just didn't work.

19:49.536 --> 19:50.319
Phoebe, please...No, Leo,

19:50.493 --> 19:51.755
listen to me, okay?

19:51.929 --> 19:53.757
We made the world
a better place,

19:53.931 --> 19:56.282
and we're gonna live in it
just the way it is now.

19:57.718 --> 19:58.762
Do you understand?

20:06.422 --> 20:09.599
We just need to give him
more time to understand.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.297
We're running out of time.

20:11.471 --> 20:14.952
If he turns them,
everything could be lost.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.260
I think it's time
we faced the facts.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.743
[indistinct chatter]

20:32.013 --> 20:33.971
[children laughing]

20:39.455 --> 20:42.850
Would you just stop fussing
and enjoy yourself already?

20:43.024 --> 20:45.156
I can't; I'm worried.About what?

20:45.331 --> 20:47.637
Look, everybody seems to
be having a great time.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.944
I didn't even know we
knew this many people.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.468
No, I'm not worried about them--
I'm worried about Leo.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.253
He should have
been here by now.

20:54.427 --> 20:55.950
And where the heck is Phoebe?

20:56.124 --> 20:58.518
She got the boys ready,
and then she just took off.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.563
Well, maybe
they're together.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.131
Or maybe you just
don't know how to have
a good time anymore.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.915
Is that a challenge?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.613
If it works.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.008
There. You happy?

21:13.141 --> 21:14.229
I need a drink!

21:14.403 --> 21:15.578
Hey, what's the matter?

21:15.752 --> 21:17.014
I don't want
to talk about it.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.799
I just want
to have a good time.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.584
What's going on?

21:21.758 --> 21:23.064
Nothing.

21:23.238 --> 21:24.457
Hey!

21:26.850 --> 21:28.330
All right, then,
I'll go mingle.

21:31.246 --> 21:32.203
Leo, come on.
What's wrong?

21:32.378 --> 21:33.770
It's complicated.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.555
It's the Avatars, isn't it?

21:35.729 --> 21:37.774
Look, if working for them
is gonna be as complicated

21:37.948 --> 21:39.776
as working for the
Elders, then I...

21:39.950 --> 21:41.082
It's not that.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.431
Then what is it?

21:43.780 --> 21:44.955
Okay, you know what?

21:45.129 --> 21:46.566
I don't want to know.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.437
We're here
to celebrate
our new life with

21:48.611 --> 21:49.569
no magic and no demons,

21:49.743 --> 21:51.875
so why don't
we just en...

21:52.049 --> 21:53.050
joy it?

21:53.224 --> 21:54.095
Leo?

21:54.269 --> 21:56.532
did you hear
what I said?

21:59.230 --> 22:00.580
Are you listening to me?

22:00.754 --> 22:02.016
What is the matter with you?

22:02.190 --> 22:03.583
Forgive me, Piper.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.759
If there was another way
to do this, I would.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.413
Do what? What are
you talking about?

22:07.587 --> 22:09.284
I have to fix a mistake.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.417
I love you.

22:12.592 --> 22:13.549
Leo!

22:13.723 --> 22:14.898
Everyone get down!

22:19.729 --> 22:20.556
Oh, no.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.602
[parytygoers screaming]

22:22.776 --> 22:24.473
Paige! The children!

22:34.178 --> 22:35.615
[yells]

22:37.617 --> 22:39.314
Die, Elder, die!

22:45.320 --> 22:46.277
[shouts]

22:55.983 --> 22:57.941
Don't let them make you forget
why I'm doing this, Phoebe.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.508
It's supposed to hurt.

22:59.682 --> 23:00.509
Go to the Book.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.903
Remember all the losses.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.034
Then go to Zankou.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.080
Wait. Zankou?

23:10.911 --> 23:12.869
[conversation resumes]

23:13.043 --> 23:14.523
Like you said...
I know.

23:16.569 --> 23:17.352
PAIGE:
Piper...

23:17.526 --> 23:18.309
Are you all right?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.181
Uh... I don't know.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.531
I guess so.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.664
I'm really
sorry about Leo.

23:24.838 --> 23:26.883
Yeah, me, too.

23:27.057 --> 23:30.583
But at least he's gone
on to a better place.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.241
PAIGE:
I'm so sorry things
got out of hand, guys.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.940
Don't you think that
was all a little weird?

23:40.114 --> 23:42.464
Yeah, it waskinda touch-
and-go there for a second

23:42.638 --> 23:45.162
with the demon attack,
but it all worked out okay.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.338
Still, it seemed a little...
I don't know... off.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.036
[Wyatt and Chris crying]

23:49.210 --> 23:50.690
Well, I certainly wasn't
expecting any more attacks,

23:50.864 --> 23:52.866
but, thank God, Leo was
there to take care of it.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.303
Yes, but it would have been nice
if Leo didn't have to go

23:55.477 --> 23:57.218
to a better place
in the process, you know.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.828
I know, but...

23:59.002 --> 24:00.351
[boys continue crying]

24:00.526 --> 24:02.266
What he did, he
did for his family,

24:02.441 --> 24:04.138
and for that I will
always love him.

24:05.356 --> 24:08.098
Paige! Can you make sure
the boys are okay?

24:08.272 --> 24:09.622
It's really impressive
that you can stay

24:09.796 --> 24:12.276
so calm after such a shock.Well, I'd be

24:12.451 --> 24:13.495
freaking out if I thought

24:13.669 --> 24:15.279
there were more
demons out there.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.064
I'd like to think those
days are finally behind us.

24:17.238 --> 24:20.023
Ugh! I can't make them stop.

24:20.197 --> 24:21.547
They're so upset.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.244
Well, that's understandable.

24:23.418 --> 24:24.898
We're all upset about
demons being in the house.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.117
Do you really think
that's why they're crying?

24:27.291 --> 24:28.379
Well, what else
would it be?

24:28.554 --> 24:30.686
Okay, Mommy's coming!

24:34.298 --> 24:35.909
You okay?

24:36.083 --> 24:37.824
I don't know.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.435
It's like Kyle, you know--
it's really a big deal.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.655
But we're never
gonna forget him.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.744
LEO:  Don't let them make you forget why I'm doing this, Phoebe.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.354
It's supposed to hurt.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.574
Never forget...

24:48.748 --> 24:50.445
I have to check the
Book of Shadows

24:50.619 --> 24:52.273
for something.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.674
Come on, Phoebe.

25:11.205 --> 25:12.685
LEO:
Remember all the losses.

25:14.469 --> 25:15.252
No!

25:19.126 --> 25:20.649
[sobbing]

25:34.228 --> 25:34.663
No.

25:34.837 --> 25:35.359
No!

25:36.839 --> 25:39.015
[panting]

25:39.189 --> 25:40.539
Oh, my God.

25:40.713 --> 25:41.583
[boys crying]

25:41.757 --> 25:42.802
It's okay.

25:42.976 --> 25:44.325
Oh, my gosh, I can't

25:44.499 --> 25:45.544
get 'em to calm down.

25:45.718 --> 25:46.545
Even Piper couldn't.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.547
I can. Where is Piper?

25:48.721 --> 25:49.678
She's in the kitchen.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.550
[boys crying]

25:53.464 --> 25:55.031
Piper, I really need
to talk to you.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.947
The Avatars didn't tell us
everything up front.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.427
What?

25:59.601 --> 26:01.081
Pain, grief... mourning.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.257
These are all things that
we're supposed to be feeling

26:03.431 --> 26:06.086
when we lose someone
we love... like Leo.

26:06.260 --> 26:10.438
Leo? Phoebe, he's
moved on to a better place,

26:10.612 --> 26:13.006
and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not dwell

26:13.180 --> 26:14.660
on such a painful memory.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.096
Okay, but if

26:16.270 --> 26:17.619
he's in a better place,

26:17.793 --> 26:19.012
then why are the boys
crying right now?

26:19.186 --> 26:20.883
It's not because
of demons.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.929
They were practically
raised around them.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.191
Yes. Well, but...

26:24.365 --> 26:25.235
Piper, listen to me.

26:25.409 --> 26:26.628
Leo is dead.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.325
The Avatars killed him,
and the boys

26:28.499 --> 26:30.719
are just too young to
feel it the way that we do,

26:30.893 --> 26:32.286
the way we were
programmed to feel it.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.417
Programmed?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.028
Phoebe, what's gotten into you?

26:35.202 --> 26:36.986
This is what Leo
was trying to show us.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.728
Leo allowed
the Avatars to kill him

26:39.902 --> 26:41.817
so that we could understand
what's going on here.

26:41.991 --> 26:44.167
I don't want to hear this.

26:44.341 --> 26:45.778
I know you don't
want to hear this,

26:45.952 --> 26:46.909
but listen to your boys.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.781
[boys crying]That's pain

26:48.955 --> 26:49.782
and it's real.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.087
Phoebe, stop.

26:51.261 --> 26:52.611
Piper, how can
you not see it?

26:52.785 --> 26:54.351
The only reason you're
okay with all this

26:54.525 --> 26:56.223
was because you wanted
to be with Leo,

26:56.397 --> 26:57.964
and now they've
taken him away?

26:58.138 --> 26:59.966
[boys crying]

27:10.585 --> 27:14.067
W... Why?! Why would
they do that?!

27:14.241 --> 27:16.635
Because Leo caused conflict.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.854
And this is
the only way

27:19.028 --> 27:22.118
they could keep Utopia going.

27:27.515 --> 27:29.212
You guys better have
a good reason

27:29.386 --> 27:31.475
for bringing me here,
because I don't want to be here.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.913
And that's exactly
why we arehere.

27:34.087 --> 27:36.655
Paige, Kyle died,
and now it's time
that you feel it.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.569
I felt it.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.528
And it would have felt
a lot worse,

27:40.702 --> 27:42.835
if I didn't know he'd
gone on to a better place.

27:43.009 --> 27:45.228
Well, that's
the thing.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.056
It should have
felt a lot worse.

27:47.230 --> 27:51.017
The Avatars made our pain go
away after they killed Kyle.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.674
I had a vision of him dying,

27:55.848 --> 27:57.284
when I touched this.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.374
He attacked one of the Avatars
with his potion,

28:00.548 --> 28:01.941
and she killed him.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.464
Do you remember
that, Paige?

28:03.638 --> 28:05.596
Why are you doing this to me?

28:05.771 --> 28:09.557
He died right here...
in your arms.

28:09.731 --> 28:10.993
I saw it.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.953
I felt it and now you
have to feel it, too.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.911
Paige, it's the only
way we can stop them.

28:16.085 --> 28:17.347
I don't want to.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.697
You have to.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.264
Just like I did.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.575
But I don't want to.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.144
Shh. It's okay.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.452
Why did they do this?

28:35.626 --> 28:38.368
To give us what we wanted.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.935
What we thoughtwe wanted.

28:42.851 --> 28:43.896
What do we do now?

28:44.070 --> 28:47.377
We're gonna do
what Leo said...

28:47.551 --> 28:49.858
and go find ourselves a demon.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.702
Sorry to interrupt,
but, um...

29:07.876 --> 29:08.921
What is it?

29:09.095 --> 29:12.011
Well, the others
sent me to, um...

29:12.185 --> 29:14.317
find out what
we're gonna do.

29:14.491 --> 29:15.449
Do?

29:15.623 --> 29:19.018
Well, I just mean...

29:19.192 --> 29:20.628
Well, the Elder is dead.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.109
The plan
has failed.

29:23.283 --> 29:26.982
Shouldn't we... retreat?

29:27.156 --> 29:28.244
Not yet.

29:28.418 --> 29:29.289
But you said
it yourself--

29:29.463 --> 29:30.681
if the Elder couldn't turn

29:30.856 --> 29:31.900
the sisters,
then there is no...

29:32.074 --> 29:33.467
I know what I said.

29:33.641 --> 29:36.600
I also know that
Leo wasn't stupid.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.037
He wouldn't have
given his life

29:38.211 --> 29:39.560
unless he knew something
would come of it.

29:39.734 --> 29:43.085
Unless it was merely the act
of a desperate man.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.046
I'm just saying,

29:47.220 --> 29:49.309
the Avatars could
move on us at any time.

29:49.483 --> 29:54.793
If we aregonna run,
we should go soon.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.146
Perhaps you're right.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.758
We should retreat.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.065
I'll let the others know.

30:06.239 --> 30:07.893
[shouts]

30:15.378 --> 30:16.902
What's the matter, Zankou?

30:17.076 --> 30:18.555
Chicken?

30:25.171 --> 30:27.347
Good thing you girls
got here when you did.

30:27.521 --> 30:28.696
I was about to leave.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.089
To go where?

30:30.263 --> 30:32.091
To live to fight another day.

30:32.265 --> 30:33.266
You won't get that chance
if you don't

30:33.440 --> 30:34.354
tell us what we want to hear.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.530
Save it, you need me.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.227
That's why Leo sent you.

30:38.401 --> 30:40.534
Glad to see he didn't die
in vain after all.

30:41.578 --> 30:42.841
Get to the point.The point is,

30:43.015 --> 30:44.233
that Leo was working with me,

30:44.407 --> 30:45.756
same as Agent Brody
before him...

30:45.931 --> 30:47.933
to undo what
has been done.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.238
Kyle was working with you?

30:49.412 --> 30:50.718
How do you think he was able

30:50.892 --> 30:52.285
to get close enough
to kill an Avatar?

30:52.459 --> 30:55.288
He realized then the combined
force of good and evil

30:55.462 --> 30:58.073
is our only chance
of stopping the Avatars.

30:58.247 --> 31:00.684
You have a greater reason for
wanting to do that than we do--

31:00.859 --> 31:02.425
survival.
True.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.514
But then again, you obviously
want it, too, otherwise

31:04.688 --> 31:06.560
we wouldn't even be having this
conversation, now would we?

31:06.734 --> 31:08.344
Now you go ahead,

31:08.518 --> 31:10.085
talk amongst yourselves.

31:10.259 --> 31:11.521
I'm not going anywhere.

31:14.785 --> 31:16.309
I'm not so sure
about this.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.354
Neither am I, but I don't
think we have a choice.

31:18.528 --> 31:19.703
We're running out of allies.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.183
We can't work
with a demon.

31:21.357 --> 31:22.358
Leo did.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.838
Yeah, look where
it got him.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.492
But that was the Avatars,
not Zankou.

31:25.666 --> 31:26.928
So how do we know

31:27.102 --> 31:28.756
he's not picking us
off one by one?

31:28.930 --> 31:30.453
What if this
is a setup?

31:30.627 --> 31:32.629
Well, he helped Kyle
get rid of an Avatar.

31:32.803 --> 31:35.110
They're who he's really after
and so are we.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.416
Okay, fine.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.896
So what if
this works?

31:38.070 --> 31:39.158
Where does
that leave us,

31:39.332 --> 31:40.333
we're fighting
demons again?

31:40.507 --> 31:41.421
Is that what
we really want?

31:41.595 --> 31:42.857
Is this?

31:43.031 --> 31:44.032
Just because
we wanted it so badly,

31:44.206 --> 31:45.120
doesn't make it right.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.643
Kyle knew
it was wrong.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.689
He knew the Avatars
couldn't be trusted.

31:48.863 --> 31:49.995
I just didn't believe him.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.344
Neither did we.

31:51.518 --> 31:52.954
Still we can
believe in him now.

31:53.128 --> 31:54.347
Leo, too.

31:54.521 --> 31:55.652
We can finish
what they started...

31:55.826 --> 31:57.089
so they didn't die in vain.

32:01.441 --> 32:02.659
So what's the plan?

32:02.833 --> 32:05.662
The plan...

32:05.836 --> 32:08.796
is for you to make
a very special potion.

32:18.762 --> 32:19.676
What's the matter?

32:19.850 --> 32:20.808
I can't find the sisters.

32:20.982 --> 32:21.896
None of them?

32:22.070 --> 32:23.071
I don't understand.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.072
I just had them.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.421
It's all right,

32:25.595 --> 32:26.683
they'll have to surface
sooner or later.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.250
PIPER:
You got that right.

32:36.998 --> 32:37.694
Ah...

32:38.826 --> 32:40.306
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.655
What are those?

32:41.829 --> 32:42.917
I think you know
what they are.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.484
And I think you
know what he is.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.660
What is the meaning of this?

32:46.834 --> 32:48.792
I don't think we have
anything to explain,

32:48.967 --> 32:51.099
we're not the ones going
around killing people.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.927
We only did
what was necessary

32:53.101 --> 32:54.581
to maintain Utopia.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.191
A little loophole you forgot
to tell us about?

32:56.365 --> 32:58.933
It was never our intention
to deceive, Paige.

32:59.107 --> 33:02.241
We merely gave you
the world you asked for.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.765
Again, except for the fact
that you were killing people.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.071
ALPHA:
Their fates
are regrettable.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.681
But I guarantee you

33:07.855 --> 33:11.076
that fewer people by far
will be lost under our rule

33:11.250 --> 33:13.948
than under the chaos
of good and evil.

33:14.122 --> 33:15.558
Yeah, but at least
with good and evil,

33:15.732 --> 33:17.082
people knew what
they were dying for.

33:17.256 --> 33:19.040
And given the choice
of what we had

33:19.214 --> 33:20.607
and what
you're offering...

33:20.781 --> 33:22.304
Now we know
what "it" is...

33:22.478 --> 33:24.089
We'll take our free will
back any day.

33:24.263 --> 33:25.829
Here, here.

33:27.701 --> 33:32.140
You'd seriously be willing
to give up peace of mind,

33:32.314 --> 33:35.535
the normal life you so covet...

33:35.709 --> 33:38.233
to go back to
the way things were?

33:38.407 --> 33:40.583
To fighting
the likes of him again?

33:41.671 --> 33:42.890
Warts and all.

33:45.762 --> 33:48.156
They're not ready for us.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.332
Perhaps not.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.204
But they will be someday.

33:53.596 --> 33:55.468
What we want
for the world

33:55.642 --> 33:57.774
is worth waiting for.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.559
Very well,

33:59.733 --> 34:02.431
we will use what
remains of our power

34:02.605 --> 34:06.305
to rewind time to
when Utopia began.

34:06.479 --> 34:08.263
Does that mean Leo
will be alive again?

34:09.482 --> 34:10.526
Of course.

34:10.700 --> 34:11.571
And Kyle?

34:11.745 --> 34:13.877
That, unfortunately,

34:14.052 --> 34:15.618
is beyond our powers.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.011
Are you kidding me?

34:17.185 --> 34:18.621
You can bring

34:18.795 --> 34:20.971
everyone that you have killed
back to life,

34:21.146 --> 34:23.061
but Kyle is beyond your powers?!

34:23.235 --> 34:25.759
The further something
recedes into the past,

34:25.933 --> 34:27.717
the more power
it takes to reverse it.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.197
ALPHA:
We can either

34:29.371 --> 34:31.330
bring back Agent Brody,

34:31.504 --> 34:33.810
or return the world
to the way it was.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.769
But I'm afraid
we cannot do both.

34:44.778 --> 34:46.084
Put the world back.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.265
ALPHA:
I'm sorry this
didn't work out...

34:53.439 --> 34:54.396
for your sakes,

34:54.570 --> 34:55.832
as well as ours.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.530
ZANKOU:
Touching.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.097
I'm gonna miss you guys.

35:38.614 --> 35:39.702
What the hell?

35:39.876 --> 35:41.791
Did you just dump
your coffee on me?

35:41.965 --> 35:43.315
What are you
talking about?

35:43.489 --> 35:44.751
You spilled yours on me,
you son of a bitch!

35:44.925 --> 35:46.274
Are you a moron?
You dumped your coffee on me!

35:46.448 --> 35:49.147
[clamoring voices]

35:51.323 --> 35:52.933
This is totally your fault.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.848
My fault?
You hit me!
Yeah?

35:55.022 --> 35:56.284
Well, all I'm saying

35:56.458 --> 35:58.417
is you better have
some good insurance!

35:58.591 --> 35:59.853
No, you better have
insurance because I'm gonna
call the cops on your ass!

36:00.027 --> 36:02.072
MAN:
Oh, please,
give me your ID.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.726
What?
Give me your ID.

36:03.900 --> 36:04.901
Where's your
insurance?Where's your insurance?

36:05.075 --> 36:05.989
Where's yours, man?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.556
Mine's right here.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.733
I'm gonna call my lawyer, okay?

36:10.907 --> 36:12.996
I'm gonna sue this whole city!

36:13.171 --> 36:14.215
Wow, I've never
been so excited

36:14.389 --> 36:16.086
to hear the sounds
of people arguing.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.175
Tell me about it.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.089
[horns, traffic]

36:19.264 --> 36:21.179
It's good to be back.

36:24.530 --> 36:26.227
Warts and all.

36:33.974 --> 36:36.498
[clamoring voices]

36:52.514 --> 36:53.472
Leo?

36:53.646 --> 36:54.777
LEO:
I'm in here.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.781
Oh, thank God.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.481
It's okay.
I'm all right.

37:02.655 --> 37:05.832
Wow, you kind of really
scared me this time.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.964
That was the plan.

37:08.138 --> 37:10.880
I was banking on
you saving me.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.578
Okay, well, next time...

37:12.752 --> 37:14.275
come up with a different plan.

37:14.449 --> 37:16.103
Next time.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.932
So wait, you remember everything

37:19.106 --> 37:21.021
even though you
technically died,

37:21.195 --> 37:24.329
but then you didn't
because time rewound so...

37:24.503 --> 37:25.721
am I making any sense?

37:25.895 --> 37:26.809
Yeah.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.202
See, I remember everything

37:28.376 --> 37:29.769
because I was unaffected
by the spell,

37:29.943 --> 37:31.684
and you remember everything
because you broke it

37:31.858 --> 37:34.252
and even though time rewound,
we still experienced it.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.079
Headache forming.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.256
All that matters
is that we faced it...

37:38.430 --> 37:40.301
regardless of
the consequences.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.912
Consequences,
you mean Kyle?

37:43.086 --> 37:44.392
No, I mean the Elders.

37:44.566 --> 37:45.828
I went against them

37:46.002 --> 37:47.787
and sided with the Avatars.

37:47.961 --> 37:50.093
I can't go unpunished.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.573
Yeah, but everything you did,

37:51.747 --> 37:53.401
you did to make the world
a safer place

37:53.575 --> 37:55.011
for everyone, including us.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.013
I don't think they're gonna
see it that way.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.580
See, no matter
what I did...

37:58.754 --> 37:59.842
What we did.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.151
Whether it was well-intentioned
or not...

38:04.325 --> 38:05.674
it's gonna cost me.

38:05.848 --> 38:08.721
Well, at least it didn't
cost you your life,

38:08.895 --> 38:11.985
which at this moment is the only
thing I'm concerned with.

38:13.465 --> 38:16.163
I don't want to lose you
ever again.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.496
Bye.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.673
KYLE:
Hello, Paige.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.111
Kyle?

38:51.285 --> 38:52.242
Careful...

38:52.417 --> 38:53.766
that used to mean a lot to me.

38:58.901 --> 38:59.989
Is this really you?

39:00.163 --> 39:03.079
In the flesh... more or less.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.212
I saw you die.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.300
That's right, you did.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.781
But as you know,

39:08.955 --> 39:10.783
sometimes it doesn't end there.

39:12.654 --> 39:16.049
Are you a whitelighter?

39:18.399 --> 39:19.574
Feels kind of weird.

39:21.489 --> 39:22.925
But, uh...

39:23.099 --> 39:24.623
at least I can still feel.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.060
How?

39:27.234 --> 39:28.931
I guess the Elders decided

39:29.105 --> 39:31.281
that I must have done something
good with my life after all.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.762
Which is a relief, considering
the mess I made of it.

39:33.936 --> 39:37.070
You didn't make
such a mess.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.637
Come on...

39:38.811 --> 39:40.508
I got a little crazy there
at the end, didn't I?

39:40.682 --> 39:43.946
A little crazy.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.687
But you did save the world.

39:45.861 --> 39:48.255
Hence the reward.

39:49.691 --> 39:52.041
I just wish I could...

39:52.215 --> 39:53.782
Paige, it's not
your fault.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.305
I understand now that my life

39:55.480 --> 39:57.003
was supposed to end
the way that it did,

39:57.177 --> 39:59.048
how it did.

39:59.222 --> 40:01.007
It was my destiny.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.228
Just like it was
our destiny to meet,

40:05.403 --> 40:07.535
to fall for each other...

40:07.709 --> 40:09.929
To lose each other?

40:12.671 --> 40:14.324
Who says we're not
gonna meet again?

40:27.947 --> 40:29.601
Take care of that for me,
will you?
