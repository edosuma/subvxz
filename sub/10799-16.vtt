00:02.041 --> 00:06.250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.041 --> 00:06.250
<i>Stardate 43657.0.</i>

00:06.291 --> 00:08.542
<i>While Commander Riker is away</i>

00:06.291 --> 00:08.542
<i>on personal leave</i>

00:08.583 --> 00:11.208
<i>the</i> Enterprise<i> has traveled</i>

00:08.583 --> 00:11.208
<i>to Sector 396</i>

00:11.250 --> 00:15.375
<i>to begin charting</i>

00:11.250 --> 00:15.375
<i>the Salebi Asteroid Belt.</i>

00:18.000 --> 00:19.166
He sent for you, too?

00:19.208 --> 00:21.417
Yes.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.417
He was very mysterious.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.417
Do you have any idea

00:21.458 --> 00:23.417
what this is about?

00:23.458 --> 00:25.458
Something happened at that

00:23.458 --> 00:25.458
cybernetics conference.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.834
Since he's come back,

00:25.500 --> 00:26.834
he's spent

00:26.875 --> 00:28.208
every off-duty minute

00:26.875 --> 00:28.208
in that lab.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.500
It's not like Data

00:28.250 --> 00:30.500
to be so secretive.

00:30.542 --> 00:32.291
And cautious.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.917
He's kept that lab

00:32.333 --> 00:33.917
locked every minute.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.875
Now, how would

00:33.959 --> 00:35.875
you know that?

00:35.917 --> 00:37.750
Uh-huh.

00:42.875 --> 00:46.000
DATA:

00:42.875 --> 00:46.000
Oh, you are early.

00:46.041 --> 00:48.250
One moment, please.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.458
DATA:

01:06.875 --> 01:09.458
You may enter now.

01:14.458 --> 01:15.417
Come on, Data.

01:15.458 --> 01:16.458
What is this?

01:16.500 --> 01:19.083
Yeah, Data,

01:16.500 --> 01:19.083
what's going on?

01:19.125 --> 01:21.583
I have invited you here

01:19.125 --> 01:21.583
to meet someone.

01:34.667 --> 01:36.583
DATA:

01:34.667 --> 01:36.583
This is Lal.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.250
Lal...

01:41.291 --> 01:43.041
Say hello

01:43.083 --> 01:45.208
to Counselor Deanna Troi.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.417
Hello, Counselor Deanna Troi.

01:49.458 --> 01:52.834
How do you do, Lal?

01:52.875 --> 01:56.458
I am functioning

01:52.875 --> 01:56.458
within normal parameters.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.834
Lal...

01:57.875 --> 02:00.583
this is Geordi La Forge.

02:00.625 --> 02:03.542
Purpose for exterior drapings,

02:00.625 --> 02:03.542
Father?

02:03.583 --> 02:05.834
It is an accepted

02:03.583 --> 02:05.834
custom

02:05.875 --> 02:07.834
that we wear clothing.

02:07.875 --> 02:11.000
Data, it called you "Father."

02:11.041 --> 02:16.083
Yes, Wesley, Lal is my child.

02:47.917 --> 02:52.458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

02:52.500 --> 02:56.709
<i>These are the voyages</i>

02:52.500 --> 02:56.709
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.375
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

02:58.417 --> 03:01.792
<i>to explore</i>

02:58.417 --> 03:01.792
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

03:01.834 --> 03:06.709
<i>to seek out new life</i>

03:01.834 --> 03:06.709
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

03:06.750 --> 03:11.166
<i>to boldly go</i>

03:06.750 --> 03:11.166
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

04:11.375 --> 04:13.250
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

04:13.291 --> 04:15.917
<i>I have just been advised</i>

04:13.291 --> 04:15.917
<i>of a highly unusual project</i>

04:15.959 --> 04:18.542
<i>undertaken by Commander Data.</i>

04:18.583 --> 04:22.583
Lal has a positronic brain,

04:18.583 --> 04:22.583
one very similar to my own.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.959
I began programming it

04:22.625 --> 04:24.959
at the cybernetics conference.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.625
LA FORGE:

04:25.000 --> 04:27.625
But nobody's ever been

04:25.000 --> 04:27.625
able to do that, Data.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.250
At least, not since

04:27.667 --> 04:29.250
you were programmed.

04:29.291 --> 04:30.542
DATA:

04:29.291 --> 04:30.542
True, but there was

04:30.583 --> 04:32.250
a new sub-micron

04:30.583 --> 04:32.250
matrix-transfer technology

04:32.291 --> 04:34.000
introduced

04:32.291 --> 04:34.000
at the conference

04:34.041 --> 04:35.417
which I discovered

04:34.041 --> 04:35.417
could be used

04:35.458 --> 04:38.542
to lay down complex

04:35.458 --> 04:38.542
neural net pathways.

04:38.583 --> 04:39.709
So, you did a transfer

04:39.750 --> 04:41.834
from your brain

04:39.750 --> 04:41.834
into Lal's?

04:41.875 --> 04:43.208
Exactly, Wesley.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.375
I realized

04:43.250 --> 04:45.375
for the first time

04:45.417 --> 04:48.792
that it was possible

04:45.417 --> 04:48.792
to continue Dr. Soong's work.

04:48.834 --> 04:49.959
My initial transfers

04:50.000 --> 04:52.041
produced very

04:50.000 --> 04:52.041
encouraging results.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.291
So I brought Lal's

04:52.083 --> 04:54.291
brain back with me.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.417
PICARD:

04:54.333 --> 04:55.417
Data...

04:58.041 --> 05:00.959
I would like

04:58.041 --> 05:00.959
to have been consulted.

05:03.166 --> 05:05.000
I have not observed

05:03.166 --> 05:05.000
anyone else on board

05:05.041 --> 05:07.500
consulting you about their

05:05.041 --> 05:07.500
procreation, Captain.

05:07.542 --> 05:11.542
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

05:11.583 --> 05:14.625
Why didn't you give it

05:11.583 --> 05:14.625
a more human look, Data?

05:14.667 --> 05:17.041
I have decided

05:14.667 --> 05:17.041
to allow my child

05:17.083 --> 05:19.750
to choose its own

05:17.083 --> 05:19.750
sex and appearance.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.542
Commander Data,

05:19.792 --> 05:21.542
at your convenience

05:21.583 --> 05:22.917
I would like to talk with you

05:21.583 --> 05:22.917
in my ready room.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.041
Counselor.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.625
I insist we do

05:29.250 --> 05:30.625
whatever we can

05:30.667 --> 05:32.417
to discourage

05:30.667 --> 05:32.417
the perception

05:32.458 --> 05:34.250
of this new android

05:32.458 --> 05:34.250
as a child.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.834
It is<i> not</i> a child.

05:35.875 --> 05:38.375
It is an invention, albeit

05:35.875 --> 05:38.375
an extraordinary one.

05:38.417 --> 05:41.083
Why should biology

05:38.417 --> 05:41.083
rather than technology

05:41.125 --> 05:43.166
determine whether

05:41.125 --> 05:43.166
it's a child?

05:43.208 --> 05:45.500
Data has created

05:43.208 --> 05:45.500
an offspring--

05:45.542 --> 05:47.792
a new life out

05:45.542 --> 05:47.792
of his own being.

05:47.834 --> 05:49.834
To me, that

05:47.834 --> 05:49.834
suggests a child.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.000
If he wishes

05:49.875 --> 05:52.000
to call Lal his child

05:52.041 --> 05:53.583
then who are we to argue?

05:53.625 --> 05:55.917
Well, if he must, but

05:53.625 --> 05:55.917
I fail to understand

05:55.959 --> 05:57.291
how a five-foot android

05:57.333 --> 05:58.875
with heuristic

05:57.333 --> 05:58.875
learning systems

05:58.917 --> 06:01.834
and the strength of ten men

05:58.917 --> 06:01.834
can be called a child.

06:01.875 --> 06:04.959
You've never been a parent.

06:11.375 --> 06:12.583
What you have done

06:12.625 --> 06:15.291
will have serious

06:12.625 --> 06:15.291
ramifications.

06:15.333 --> 06:19.583
I am truly dismayed

06:15.333 --> 06:19.583
that you told no one

06:19.625 --> 06:21.709
of what you were doing.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.041
I am sorry, Captain.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.792
I did not anticipate

06:23.083 --> 06:25.792
your objections.

06:25.834 --> 06:28.375
Do you wish me

06:25.834 --> 06:28.375
to deactivate Lal?

06:28.417 --> 06:29.959
It's a life, Data!

06:30.000 --> 06:34.083
It can't be activated

06:30.000 --> 06:34.083
and deactivated simply.

06:34.125 --> 06:38.542
This is a most...

06:34.125 --> 06:38.542
stupendous undertaking.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.458
Have you any idea

06:40.333 --> 06:42.458
what will happen

06:42.500 --> 06:44.667
when Starfleet

06:42.500 --> 06:44.667
learns about this?

06:44.709 --> 06:47.709
I have followed all

06:44.709 --> 06:47.709
of Starfleet's regulations

06:47.750 --> 06:49.125
to the best of my ability.

06:49.166 --> 06:51.291
I expected

06:49.166 --> 06:51.291
they would be pleased.

06:52.917 --> 06:54.583
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

06:54.625 --> 06:59.709
Well... you have taken on

06:54.625 --> 06:59.709
quite a responsibility, Data.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.417
To prepare, I have scanned

07:02.458 --> 07:04.542
all available literature

07:02.458 --> 07:04.542
on parenting.

07:04.583 --> 07:08.041
There seems to be

07:04.583 --> 07:08.041
much confusion on this issue.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.750
One traditional doctrine

07:09.792 --> 07:13.208
insists "spare the rod

07:09.792 --> 07:13.208
and spoil the child,"

07:13.250 --> 07:15.250
suggesting a punitive approach,

07:15.291 --> 07:17.125
while another,

07:15.291 --> 07:17.125
more liberal attitude

07:17.166 --> 07:18.625
would allow the child

07:18.667 --> 07:19.583
enormous freedom.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.291
Data...

07:19.625 --> 07:21.291
And what Klingons

07:21.333 --> 07:22.542
do to their children...

07:22.583 --> 07:24.166
Data, I am not talking

07:22.583 --> 07:24.166
about parenting!

07:24.208 --> 07:26.250
I am talking about the

07:24.208 --> 07:26.250
extraordinary consequences

07:26.291 --> 07:28.250
of creating a new life!

07:28.291 --> 07:32.709
Does that not describe

07:28.291 --> 07:32.709
becoming a parent, sir?

07:39.542 --> 07:44.500
Data, you are seeking

07:39.542 --> 07:44.500
to achieve

07:44.542 --> 07:48.000
what only your own creator

07:44.542 --> 07:48.000
has been able to achieve--

07:48.041 --> 07:53.542
to make another functioning

07:48.041 --> 07:53.542
sentient android--

07:53.583 --> 07:56.792
to make another Data.

07:56.834 --> 07:59.750
That is why I must

07:56.834 --> 07:59.750
attempt this, sir.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.208
I have observed

07:59.792 --> 08:02.208
that in most species

08:02.250 --> 08:06.083
there is a primal instinct

08:02.250 --> 08:06.083
to perpetuate themselves.

08:06.125 --> 08:10.125
Until now, I have been

08:06.125 --> 08:10.125
the last of my kind.

08:10.166 --> 08:13.417
If I were to be damaged

08:10.166 --> 08:13.417
or destroyed

08:13.458 --> 08:15.875
I would be lost forever.

08:15.917 --> 08:19.792
But if I am successful

08:15.917 --> 08:19.792
with the creation of Lal

08:19.834 --> 08:22.166
my continuance is assured.

08:22.208 --> 08:24.667
I understand the risks, sir,

08:24.709 --> 08:28.834
and I am prepared

08:24.709 --> 08:28.834
to accept the responsibility.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.625
(<i> woman chuckling</i> )

08:37.667 --> 08:39.333
Gender female.

08:39.375 --> 08:42.333
That's right,

08:39.375 --> 08:42.333
just like me.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.959
Gender male.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.959
Correct.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.792
And I am gender... neuter.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.959
Inadequate.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.792
That is why you must

08:51.000 --> 08:52.792
choose a gender, Lal,

08:52.834 --> 08:55.083
to complete your appearance.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.542
What are criteria?

08:56.583 --> 09:00.000
Access your data bank

08:56.583 --> 09:00.000
on sexuality, level two.

09:00.041 --> 09:02.250
That will define

09:00.041 --> 09:02.250
the parameters.

09:02.291 --> 09:05.500
Whatever you decide

09:02.291 --> 09:05.500
will be yours for

09:02.291 --> 09:05.500
your lifetime.

09:05.542 --> 09:09.709
It's a decision that

09:05.542 --> 09:09.709
will affect how people

09:05.542 --> 09:09.709
interrelate with you.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.500
I choose your sex

09:09.750 --> 09:12.500
and appearance.

09:12.542 --> 09:13.500
No, Lal.

09:13.542 --> 09:14.750
That would be confusing.

09:14.792 --> 09:16.709
We are taking you

09:14.792 --> 09:16.709
to the holodeck

09:16.750 --> 09:20.291
to show you several

09:16.750 --> 09:20.291
thousand composites

09:16.750 --> 09:20.291
I have programmed.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.125
You may choose from them.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.083
Several thousand?

09:24.125 --> 09:26.000
This is a big decision.

09:33.959 --> 09:36.417
DATA:

09:33.959 --> 09:36.417
Counselor?

09:36.458 --> 09:38.041
Lal has narrowed

09:36.458 --> 09:38.041
the choices to four.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.834
Would you like to see?

09:39.875 --> 09:40.834
Yes.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.041
Yes, of course, Data.

09:44.834 --> 09:50.542
Computer, Lal-- gender

09:44.834 --> 09:50.542
sequence finalists, begin.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.291
An Andorian female.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.333
Interesting.

09:54.375 --> 09:57.542
You'll be the only one

09:54.375 --> 09:57.542
on board the<i> Enterprise,</i> Lal.

09:57.583 --> 10:03.500
Hmm. That could make

09:57.583 --> 10:03.500
socialization

09:57.583 --> 10:03.500
more difficult.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.208
A human male.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.458
Very attractive.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.125
There's no problem

10:06.500 --> 10:10.125
with socialization here.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.959
A human female.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.917
I like her.

10:13.959 --> 10:15.875
A Klingon male.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.625
A friend for Worf.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.875
They're all very interesting.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.834
Do you have a favorite?

10:22.875 --> 10:26.625
Yes, I have chosen.

10:30.792 --> 10:33.542
I have completed assembly

10:30.792 --> 10:33.542
of the replicated anatomy.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.000
I was able to provide Lal

10:35.041 --> 10:38.083
with more realistic skin

10:35.041 --> 10:38.083
and eye color than my own.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.250
Congratulations, Data.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.250
It's a girl.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.667
This is home, Lal.

10:58.709 --> 11:00.625
Home.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.709
Place of residence.

11:02.750 --> 11:06.333
Social unit formed by

11:02.750 --> 11:06.333
a family living together.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.750
Yes.

11:07.792 --> 11:11.834
We are a family, Lal.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.959
Chair.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.291
To sit in.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.250
Sit.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.917
Good.

11:27.959 --> 11:30.083
Painting.

11:30.125 --> 11:32.000
Painting.

11:32.041 --> 11:35.250
Colors produced

11:32.041 --> 11:35.250
on a surface by

11:32.041 --> 11:35.250
applying a pigment.

11:35.291 --> 11:36.875
Yes.

11:36.917 --> 11:41.000
I will teach you to recognize

11:36.917 --> 11:41.000
the artistry in paintings.

11:44.625 --> 11:45.917
Soft.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.709
Yes, very good, Lal.

11:48.750 --> 11:52.667
You have correctly processed

11:48.750 --> 11:52.667
the sense of touch.

11:52.709 --> 11:55.875
There are many

11:52.709 --> 11:55.875
fascinating experiences

11:55.917 --> 11:57.917
I wish to share with you.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.291
Painting.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.583
No.

12:00.625 --> 12:03.959
That is a flower, Lal.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.750
Inhale.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.542
(<i> sniffs</i> )

12:07.583 --> 12:09.375
(<i> sniffs</i> )

12:09.417 --> 12:10.375
Smell!

12:10.417 --> 12:11.375
Yes.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.125
Show me more, Father.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.709
DATA:

12:13.166 --> 12:15.709
<i>Second Officer,</i>

12:13.166 --> 12:15.709

12:17.208 --> 12:20.291
<i>at the most elementary level</i>

12:17.208 --> 12:20.291

12:20.333 --> 12:22.000
<i>Lal is progressing very slowly</i>

12:22.041 --> 12:24.959
<i>but is not deterred</i>

12:22.041 --> 12:24.959
<i>by early setbacks.</i>

12:29.625 --> 12:32.709
<i>While motor coordination</i>

12:29.625 --> 12:32.709
<i>has improved 12 percent,</i>

12:32.750 --> 12:34.583
<i>reflexes still need</i>

12:32.750 --> 12:34.583
<i>to develop.</i>

12:39.750 --> 12:43.000
<i>Visual comprehension is</i>

12:39.750 --> 12:43.000
<i>especially difficult for Lal.</i>

12:43.041 --> 12:47.375
<i>Translating her vast data banks</i>

12:43.041 --> 12:47.375
<i>into recognizable applications</i>

12:47.417 --> 12:49.709
<i>may improve</i>

12:47.417 --> 12:49.709
<i>with additional transfers.</i>

12:49.750 --> 12:51.208
<i>She is also learning</i>

12:51.250 --> 12:53.417
<i>to supplement</i>

12:51.250 --> 12:53.417
<i>her innate android behavior</i>

12:53.458 --> 12:55.750
<i>with simulated human responses.</i>

13:02.500 --> 13:04.125
<i>And it is interesting to note</i>

13:04.166 --> 13:06.625
<i>that as I observe Lal</i>

13:04.166 --> 13:06.625
<i>learning about her world,</i>

13:06.667 --> 13:09.333
<i>I share in her experience,</i>

13:06.667 --> 13:09.333
<i>almost as though</i>

13:09.375 --> 13:11.917
<i>I am learning things</i>

13:09.375 --> 13:11.917
<i>over again.</i>

13:27.583 --> 13:30.208
The transfer itself

13:27.583 --> 13:30.208
is fairly simple.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.250
Each neural pathway

13:30.250 --> 13:32.250
in my brain

13:32.291 --> 13:34.458
is duplicated

13:32.291 --> 13:34.458
precisely in hers.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.208
Theoretically,

13:34.500 --> 13:36.208
the duplicate brains

13:36.250 --> 13:39.125
should be able to store and

13:36.250 --> 13:39.125
process the same information,

13:39.166 --> 13:41.458
but until all of the transfers

13:39.166 --> 13:41.458
are complete

13:41.500 --> 13:42.750
we will not know for certain.

13:42.792 --> 13:44.792
What does Lal do

13:42.792 --> 13:44.792
when you're on duty?

13:44.834 --> 13:46.583
She studies in our quarters.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.875
She requires

13:46.625 --> 13:48.875
very little supervision.

13:48.917 --> 13:50.834
Lal is quite self-sufficient.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.500
Have you considered

13:50.875 --> 13:52.500
sending her to school?

13:52.542 --> 13:54.333
She already has access

13:54.375 --> 13:57.000
to the sum of human knowledge--

13:54.375 --> 13:57.000
from me.

13:57.041 --> 14:00.917
Data, she could learn

13:57.041 --> 14:00.917
a lot by being with

13:57.041 --> 14:00.917
children her own age.

14:00.959 --> 14:02.875
She is only two weeks old.

14:02.917 --> 14:05.083
Okay, close to her own age.

14:05.125 --> 14:07.500
CRUSHER: Dr. Crusher

14:05.125 --> 14:07.500
to Ensign Crusher.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.291
Aren't you supposed to be

14:07.542 --> 14:10.291
getting a haircut, Wesley?

14:11.625 --> 14:13.959
I'm on my way.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.583
Parents...

14:16.625 --> 14:18.750
Nothing personal.

14:24.917 --> 14:31.166
Lal, the third cross-link

14:24.917 --> 14:31.166
transfer series is complete.

14:31.208 --> 14:34.333
Father, what is my purpose?

14:34.375 --> 14:36.125
Purpose?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.125
My function.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.959
My reason for being.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.792
That is a complex

14:40.000 --> 14:42.792
question, Lal.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.417
I can only begin

14:45.500 --> 14:47.417
to answer

14:47.458 --> 14:49.875
by telling you

14:47.458 --> 14:49.875
that our function

14:49.917 --> 14:52.959
is to contribute

14:49.917 --> 14:52.959
in a positive way

14:53.000 --> 14:55.542
to the world in which we live.

14:55.583 --> 14:58.583
Why am I me, instead

14:55.583 --> 14:58.583
of someone else?

14:58.625 --> 15:01.500
Because you are my child.

15:01.542 --> 15:04.291
Where did I come from?

15:04.333 --> 15:05.750
These questions...

15:05.792 --> 15:07.458
These questions suggest

15:07.500 --> 15:10.333
that we have made

15:07.500 --> 15:10.333
a successful transfer

15:10.375 --> 15:13.333
of the heuristic

15:10.375 --> 15:13.333
associative pathways.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.709
You will now begin

15:13.375 --> 15:15.709
to process information

15:15.750 --> 15:20.417
on logic, aesthetics,

15:15.750 --> 15:20.417
metaphysics and epistemology.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.458
You are truly

15:20.458 --> 15:23.458
becoming sentient, Lal.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.959
How?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.375
By developing the awareness

15:26.417 --> 15:29.500
to question and examine

15:26.417 --> 15:29.500
your perceptions.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.750
Why do we have two hands?

15:33.792 --> 15:35.834
Why not three or four?

15:35.875 --> 15:37.625
Why is the sky black?

15:37.667 --> 15:38.542
Why do...?

15:38.583 --> 15:40.750
(<i> click</i> )

15:42.583 --> 15:46.750
Tomorrow will be your

15:42.583 --> 15:46.750
first day of school, Lal.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.375
I assure you, Admiral,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.375
there is no better guide

15:56.417 --> 15:58.041
into this life for Lal

15:56.417 --> 15:58.041
than Data.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.000
He's doing an excellent job.

16:00.041 --> 16:01.542
We all have enormous admiration

16:01.583 --> 16:04.333
for what Commander Data

16:01.583 --> 16:04.333
has already achieved

16:04.375 --> 16:08.875
but we have superior facilities

16:04.375 --> 16:08.875
and personnel here at Galor IV.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.667
A starship is hardly

16:08.917 --> 16:11.667
the proper setting for...

16:11.709 --> 16:13.500
This starship's mission is

16:11.709 --> 16:13.500
to seek out new life

16:13.542 --> 16:15.333
and that is exactly

16:13.542 --> 16:15.333
what Commander Data is doing,

16:15.375 --> 16:16.792
under my guidance.

16:16.834 --> 16:19.875
We all want what's best

16:16.834 --> 16:19.875
for the new android.

16:19.917 --> 16:21.875
As do I.

16:21.917 --> 16:23.959
(<i> sighs</i> )

16:24.000 --> 16:28.333
I would be willing to consider

16:24.000 --> 16:28.333
releasing Lal<i> and</i> Data to you

16:28.375 --> 16:31.166
so that he may continue

16:28.375 --> 16:31.166
his work with her.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.333
His presence

16:31.208 --> 16:33.333
would undoubtedly retard

16:33.375 --> 16:35.542
the new android's progress.

16:35.583 --> 16:40.125
Admiral, to you,

16:35.583 --> 16:40.125
Lal is a new android.

16:40.166 --> 16:44.000
But, to Data...

16:40.166 --> 16:44.000
she's his child.

16:44.041 --> 16:45.625
His child?

16:45.667 --> 16:47.542
Yes, Admiral--

16:45.667 --> 16:47.542
it may not be easy

16:47.583 --> 16:49.417
for you and I

16:47.583 --> 16:49.417
to see her that way

16:49.458 --> 16:55.500
but he<i> does,</i>

16:49.458 --> 16:55.500
and I respect that.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.375
They will remain here for now.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.375
Starfleet's policy on research

16:57.417 --> 17:00.375
is clear.

17:00.417 --> 17:03.959
You're making your stand

17:00.417 --> 17:03.959
on very uncertain ground.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.041
I do hope it doesn't fall

17:04.000 --> 17:07.041
out from under you.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.917
Haftel out.

17:14.959 --> 17:16.625
She achieved

17:14.959 --> 17:16.625
a very high score

17:16.667 --> 17:18.667
on a test

17:16.667 --> 17:18.667
of academic achievement.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.375
A perfect score.

17:20.417 --> 17:24.208
Yes, which is why we started her

17:20.417 --> 17:24.208
out with the older children,

17:24.250 --> 17:26.583
but Lal couldn't

17:24.250 --> 17:26.583
understand the nuances

17:26.625 --> 17:29.583
of how they related

17:26.625 --> 17:29.583
to each other.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.583
I see.

17:31.625 --> 17:33.417
We decided

17:31.625 --> 17:33.417
the best thing to do

17:33.458 --> 17:35.750
would be to put her

17:33.458 --> 17:35.750
with younger children.

17:35.792 --> 17:38.000
That would seem

17:35.792 --> 17:38.000
to be reasonable.

17:38.041 --> 17:41.125
It isn't working out that way.

17:48.083 --> 17:51.083
The children

17:48.083 --> 17:51.083
are afraid of her.

17:56.834 --> 18:01.250
Father, what is the significance

17:56.834 --> 18:01.250
of laughter?

18:01.291 --> 18:05.500
It is a human

18:01.291 --> 18:05.500
physiological

18:01.291 --> 18:05.500
response to humor.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.417
Then, judging

18:05.542 --> 18:07.417
from their laughter,

18:07.458 --> 18:10.792
the children at school

18:07.458 --> 18:10.792
found my remarks humorous.

18:10.834 --> 18:17.333
So without understanding humor,

18:10.834 --> 18:17.333
I have somehow mastered it.

18:17.375 --> 18:20.625
Deck 15.

18:23.208 --> 18:26.041
Lal.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.375
Yes, Father?

18:27.417 --> 18:29.750
The children were not

18:27.417 --> 18:29.750
laughing<i> with</i> you.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.667
They were laughing<i> at</i> you.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.750
Explain.

18:33.792 --> 18:36.834
One is meant kindly,

18:33.792 --> 18:36.834
the other is not.

18:39.208 --> 18:41.291
Why would they wish

18:39.208 --> 18:41.291
to be unkind?

18:41.333 --> 18:43.333
Because you are different.

18:43.375 --> 18:46.000
Differences

18:43.375 --> 18:46.000
sometimes scare people.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.542
I have learned

18:46.041 --> 18:48.542
that some of them

18:48.583 --> 18:50.959
use humor to hide their fear.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.583
I do not wish to be different.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.959
Doctor?

19:04.000 --> 19:08.375
I require your advice

19:04.000 --> 19:08.375
as a successful parent.

19:08.417 --> 19:11.834
Uh! W-Well, thank you, Data.

19:11.875 --> 19:14.917
I'd like to think I was.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.375
Well, please sit down.

19:22.959 --> 19:25.000
How's Lal?

19:25.041 --> 19:26.291
Lal is realizing

19:26.333 --> 19:28.417
she is not the same

19:26.333 --> 19:28.417
as other children.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.041
Is it lonely for her?

19:32.083 --> 19:33.041
She does

19:32.083 --> 19:33.041
not feel

19:33.083 --> 19:34.959
the emotion of loneliness,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.709
but she can observe how isolated

19:35.000 --> 19:38.709
she is from the others.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.667
She wishes to be more like them.

19:40.709 --> 19:43.125
I do not know

19:40.709 --> 19:43.125
how to help her.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.417
Lal is passing into sentience.

19:45.458 --> 19:49.250
It is perhaps the most difficult

19:45.458 --> 19:49.250
stage of her development.

19:49.291 --> 19:56.166
When... when Wesley

19:49.291 --> 19:56.166
was growing up

19:56.208 --> 19:58.500
he was an extraordinarily

19:56.208 --> 19:58.500
bright boy,

19:58.542 --> 20:02.792
but he had a hard time

19:58.542 --> 20:02.792
making friends.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.458
I think the other children

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
were a little

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
intimidated by him.

20:06.542 --> 20:10.000
That is precisely what

20:06.542 --> 20:10.000
happened to Lal in school.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.667
How did you help him?

20:12.709 --> 20:17.333
Well... first, I went back

20:12.709 --> 20:17.333
to my own childhood

20:17.375 --> 20:20.750
and remembered

20:17.375 --> 20:20.750
how painful it was for me

20:20.792 --> 20:23.458
because... I remember a time

20:23.500 --> 20:27.375
when I wasn't very popular,

20:23.500 --> 20:27.375
either.

20:27.417 --> 20:28.875
And when I told that to Wesley

20:28.917 --> 20:31.166
it made him feel

20:28.917 --> 20:31.166
a little better.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.333
He knew I understood

20:31.208 --> 20:33.333
what he was going through.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.792
I have not told Lal

20:34.834 --> 20:37.333
how difficult it was for<i> me</i>

20:34.834 --> 20:37.333
to assimilate.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.875
I did not wish

20:37.375 --> 20:39.875
to discourage her.

20:39.917 --> 20:42.667
Perhaps that was an error

20:39.917 --> 20:42.667
in judgment.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.250
You didn't have anyone

20:44.291 --> 20:47.458
with experience

20:44.291 --> 20:47.458
to help you through sentience.

20:47.500 --> 20:51.125
She, at least, has you.

20:51.166 --> 20:55.000
Just help her realize

20:51.166 --> 20:55.000
she's not alone

20:55.041 --> 20:58.917
and... be there to nurture her

20:58.959 --> 21:01.125
when she needs love

20:58.959 --> 21:01.125
and attention.

21:02.667 --> 21:05.291
I can give her attention,

21:02.667 --> 21:05.291
Doctor,

21:05.333 --> 21:08.166
but I am incapable

21:05.333 --> 21:08.166
of giving her love.

21:10.917 --> 21:16.041
Now, why do I find that

21:10.917 --> 21:16.041
so hard to believe?

21:16.083 --> 21:19.417
(<i> rapid beeping</i> )

21:19.458 --> 21:22.625
WORF:

21:19.458 --> 21:22.625
Captain, incoming signal.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.333
Starfleet priority one.

21:24.375 --> 21:26.500
Admiral Haftel.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.750
On my monitor, Lieutenant.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.750
Admiral.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.792
HAFTEL:

21:33.792 --> 21:36.792
Captain Picard, I hope

21:33.792 --> 21:36.792
I didn't disturb you.

21:36.834 --> 21:38.375
Not at all.

21:38.417 --> 21:41.750
I have discussed my concerns

21:38.417 --> 21:41.750
with Starfleet Command.

21:41.792 --> 21:45.208
You are to hold your position

21:41.792 --> 21:45.208
until I join you.

21:45.250 --> 21:49.208
And I shall personally review

21:45.250 --> 21:49.208
the android's development.

21:49.250 --> 21:50.250
Understood.

21:50.291 --> 21:51.667
I should advise you, Captain,

21:51.709 --> 21:54.375
that if I'm not satisfied

21:51.709 --> 21:54.375
with what I see,

21:54.417 --> 21:57.583
I am empowered to take

21:54.417 --> 21:57.583
the android back with me.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.041
Haftel out.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.959
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

22:07.000 --> 22:08.792
<i>We are holding position</i>

22:07.000 --> 22:08.792
<i>pending the arrival</i>

22:08.834 --> 22:11.834
<i>of Admiral Haftel</i>

22:08.834 --> 22:11.834
<i>from Starfleet Research.</i>

22:11.875 --> 22:15.291
<i>Commander Data is completing</i>

22:11.875 --> 22:15.291
<i>his final neural transfers</i>

22:15.333 --> 22:18.250
<i>to the android</i>

22:15.333 --> 22:18.250
<i>he has named "Lal,"</i>

22:18.291 --> 22:20.792
<i>which, I have learned,</i>

22:18.291 --> 22:20.792
<i>in the language Hindi</i>

22:20.834 --> 22:23.750
<i>means "beloved."</i>

22:24.959 --> 22:26.041
That looks very good.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.208
Thanks, Guinan.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.417
Hello, Data.

22:30.458 --> 22:31.875
Guinan.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.959
Lal, how are you?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.291
I am functioning

22:41.000 --> 22:44.291
within normal...

22:44.333 --> 22:46.417
I am fine, thank you.

22:46.458 --> 22:47.834
Good.

22:47.875 --> 22:50.834
Guinan, Lal needs

22:47.875 --> 22:50.834
to observe human behavior.

22:50.875 --> 22:53.375
Well, she's in

22:50.875 --> 22:53.375
the right place for it.

22:53.417 --> 22:54.458
And, for this opportunity

22:54.500 --> 22:55.959
she is willing

22:54.500 --> 22:55.959
to provide services

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
to assist you.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.000
Ah.

22:58.041 --> 22:59.083
Father says

22:58.041 --> 22:59.083
I would learn

22:59.125 --> 23:00.250
a great deal

22:59.125 --> 23:00.250
from working

23:00.291 --> 23:02.792
with someone

23:00.291 --> 23:02.792
as old as you.

23:05.208 --> 23:06.375
You're hired.

23:08.041 --> 23:10.542
The most important part about

23:08.041 --> 23:10.542
working someplace like this

23:10.583 --> 23:12.417
is the art of listening.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.375
I have some expertise,

23:12.458 --> 23:15.375
so I shall teach you.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.250
That would be

23:15.417 --> 23:17.250
most beneficial.

23:17.291 --> 23:20.458
I've been programmed

23:17.291 --> 23:20.458
with a listing of 1,412

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
known beverages.

23:21.542 --> 23:22.917
What did you say?

23:22.959 --> 23:25.083
I've been programmed

23:22.959 --> 23:25.083
with a listing of 1,400--

23:25.125 --> 23:26.333
"I've"?

23:26.375 --> 23:28.375
You have used

23:26.375 --> 23:28.375
a verbal contraction.

23:28.417 --> 23:30.959
You said "I've"

23:28.417 --> 23:30.959
instead of "I have."

23:31.000 --> 23:33.417
It is a skill my program

23:31.000 --> 23:33.417
has never mastered.

23:33.458 --> 23:34.750
Then I will desist.

23:34.792 --> 23:35.875
No.

23:35.917 --> 23:38.083
You have exceeded my abilities.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.458
I do not object, but...

23:39.500 --> 23:42.542
I do not understand

23:39.500 --> 23:42.542
how this has occurred.

23:42.583 --> 23:44.083
PICARD: Picard

23:42.583 --> 23:44.083
to Commander Data.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.709
Please report to my ready room.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.333
Aye, sir.

23:57.959 --> 24:01.250
I am certain the Admiral

23:57.959 --> 24:01.250
is anxious to meet Lal.

24:01.291 --> 24:02.500
I have been sending him

24:02.542 --> 24:05.000
regular status reports

24:02.542 --> 24:05.000
on her development.

24:05.041 --> 24:09.625
His visit is not just an

24:05.041 --> 24:09.625
inspection of Lal's progress.

24:09.667 --> 24:11.750
He has expressed

24:09.667 --> 24:11.750
a concern

24:11.792 --> 24:13.375
for her environment.

24:13.417 --> 24:14.750
Her environment, sir?

24:14.792 --> 24:18.917
He believes the Daystrom Annex

24:14.792 --> 24:18.917
on Galor IV

24:18.959 --> 24:21.000
would be more suitable.

24:21.041 --> 24:24.500
Then he wishes to relocate us.

24:24.542 --> 24:27.709
Not you, Data.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.417
Just her.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.458
I would not be

24:31.458 --> 24:33.458
in favor of that, sir.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.667
There are many things that she

24:33.500 --> 24:36.667
can learn only from me--

24:36.709 --> 24:40.041
my lifetime of experiences,

24:36.709 --> 24:40.041
the mistakes I have made

24:40.083 --> 24:42.166
and what I have learned

24:40.083 --> 24:42.166
from them...

24:42.208 --> 24:45.500
WORF:

24:42.208 --> 24:45.500
Captain, Commander Riker's

24:42.208 --> 24:45.500
shuttle has just returned.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.125
Acknowledged,

24:45.542 --> 24:47.125
Lieutenant.

24:47.166 --> 24:48.959
Will you advise

24:47.166 --> 24:48.959
Commander Riker

24:49.000 --> 24:50.417
I will meet with

24:49.000 --> 24:50.417
him in one hour.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.667
Picard out.

24:52.709 --> 24:54.375
The Admiral is

24:52.709 --> 24:54.375
taking the position

24:54.417 --> 24:57.291
that Lal's development

24:54.417 --> 24:57.291
should be overseen

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
by the most

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
experienced

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
personnel.

25:05.208 --> 25:08.500
Then he is questioning

25:05.208 --> 25:08.500
my ability as a parent.

25:08.542 --> 25:11.417
In a manner of speaking.

25:11.458 --> 25:14.208
Does the Admiral have children?

25:14.250 --> 25:18.083
Yes, I believe he does, Data.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.375
Why?

25:19.417 --> 25:21.291
I am forced to wonder

25:21.333 --> 25:23.750
how much experience

25:21.333 --> 25:23.750
<i>he</i> had as a parent

25:23.792 --> 25:27.417
when his first child was born.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.709
You see?

25:36.750 --> 25:38.250
What are they doing?

25:38.291 --> 25:39.959
It's called flirting.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.834
They seem to be communicating

25:40.000 --> 25:43.834
telepathically.

25:43.875 --> 25:47.250
They're both thinking

25:43.875 --> 25:47.250
the same thing

25:47.291 --> 25:49.792
if that's what you mean.

25:52.250 --> 25:57.125
Guinan, is the joining of hands

25:52.250 --> 25:57.125
a symbolic act for humans?

25:57.166 --> 25:59.542
It shows affection.

25:59.583 --> 26:01.250
Humans like to

25:59.583 --> 26:01.250
touch each other.

26:01.291 --> 26:04.166
They start with the

26:01.291 --> 26:04.166
hands and go from there.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.250
He's biting that female!

26:08.291 --> 26:09.583
No, he's not biting her.

26:09.625 --> 26:10.834
They're pressing lips.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.917
It's called kissing.

26:16.917 --> 26:19.542
Why are they leaving?

26:19.583 --> 26:21.083
Lal, there are some things

26:21.125 --> 26:22.875
your father's just going

26:21.125 --> 26:22.875
to have to explain to you

26:22.917 --> 26:25.125
when he thinks

26:22.917 --> 26:25.125
you're ready.

26:33.458 --> 26:36.333
You're new around

26:33.458 --> 26:36.333
here, aren't you?

26:36.375 --> 26:37.792
Yes.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.291
Lal? Lal!

26:41.333 --> 26:42.583
Put him down.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.875
DATA:

26:44.500 --> 26:45.875
Commander?

26:45.917 --> 26:48.750
What are your intentions

26:45.917 --> 26:48.750
toward my daughter?

26:48.792 --> 26:51.333
Your daughter?

26:53.041 --> 26:54.667
Nice to meet you.

27:05.583 --> 27:09.291
I watch them and I can do

27:05.583 --> 27:09.291
the things they do,

27:09.333 --> 27:13.583
but I will never

27:09.333 --> 27:13.583
feel the emotions.

27:13.625 --> 27:15.625
I'll never know love.

27:15.667 --> 27:19.125
It is a limitation

27:15.667 --> 27:19.125
we must learn to accept, Lal.

27:19.166 --> 27:22.375
Then why do you still try

27:19.166 --> 27:22.375
to emulate humans?

27:22.417 --> 27:24.166
What purpose does it serve

27:24.208 --> 27:27.041
except to remind you

27:24.208 --> 27:27.041
that you are incomplete?

27:27.083 --> 27:31.458
I have asked myself

27:27.083 --> 27:31.458
that many times

27:31.500 --> 27:34.166
as I have struggled

27:31.500 --> 27:34.166
to be more human.

27:36.333 --> 27:40.250
Until I realized it

27:36.333 --> 27:40.250
is the struggle itself

27:40.291 --> 27:42.208
that is most important.

27:42.250 --> 27:45.750
We must strive to be

27:42.250 --> 27:45.750
more than we are, Lal.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.208
It does not matter

27:47.250 --> 27:50.417
that we will never reach

27:47.250 --> 27:50.417
our ultimate goal.

27:50.458 --> 27:53.875
The effort yields

27:50.458 --> 27:53.875
its own rewards.

27:53.917 --> 27:57.125
You are wise, Father.

27:57.166 --> 28:02.375
It is the difference between

27:57.166 --> 28:02.375
knowledge and experience.

28:04.041 --> 28:08.333
I learned today that humans

28:04.041 --> 28:08.333
like to hold hands.

28:08.375 --> 28:12.166
It is a symbolic gesture

28:08.375 --> 28:12.166
of affection.

28:37.125 --> 28:40.625
No<i> objective</i> viewpoint

28:37.125 --> 28:40.625
could see it any other way.

28:40.667 --> 28:43.500
Forgive me, Admiral, I

28:40.667 --> 28:43.500
thought you were sent here

28:43.542 --> 28:46.208
to form an opinion,

28:43.542 --> 28:46.208
not to justify one.

28:46.250 --> 28:49.709
Captain, let's not make this

28:46.250 --> 28:49.709
any more difficult

28:49.750 --> 28:51.333
than it needs to be, hmm?

28:51.375 --> 28:54.208
I see no need

28:51.375 --> 28:54.208
for it to be difficult at all.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.667
I understand your concerns.

28:55.709 --> 28:58.333
What I'm asking for

28:55.709 --> 28:58.333
is time, patience.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.667
If you have

28:58.375 --> 28:59.667
an open mind

28:59.709 --> 29:01.250
I'm sure you

28:59.709 --> 29:01.250
will see

29:01.291 --> 29:04.083
that it is imperative that Data

29:01.291 --> 29:04.083
and Lal be kept together

29:04.125 --> 29:06.250
during the formative stages

29:04.125 --> 29:06.250
of her development.

29:06.291 --> 29:09.667
After that, I have no doubt

29:06.291 --> 29:09.667
Commander Data will be delighted

29:09.709 --> 29:11.875
to deliver her

29:09.709 --> 29:11.875
to Starfleet Research.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.875
That's not satisfactory.

29:13.917 --> 29:16.125
If mistakes are made,

29:16.166 --> 29:19.041
the damage that's done

29:16.166 --> 29:19.041
might be irreparable.

29:19.083 --> 29:22.375
I'm convinced the damage

29:19.083 --> 29:22.375
<i>will</i> be irreparable

29:22.417 --> 29:24.041
if they're separated.

29:24.083 --> 29:29.291
Captain, are we talking

29:24.083 --> 29:29.291
about breaking up a family?

29:29.333 --> 29:33.834
Isn't that rather a sentimental

29:29.333 --> 29:33.834
attitude about androids?

29:36.208 --> 29:38.709
They're living, sentient beings.

29:38.750 --> 29:41.417
Their rights and privileges in

29:38.750 --> 29:41.417
our society have been defined.

29:41.458 --> 29:43.333
I helped define them.

29:43.375 --> 29:46.208
Yes, Captain, and I am

29:43.375 --> 29:46.208
more than willing

29:46.250 --> 29:47.667
to acknowledge that.

29:47.709 --> 29:49.625
What you must acknowledge

29:49.667 --> 29:52.875
is that Lal may be

29:49.667 --> 29:52.875
a technological step forward

29:52.917 --> 29:56.458
in the development

29:52.917 --> 29:56.458
of artificial intelligence.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.458
A most significant step.

29:58.500 --> 29:59.834
Yes, and work like this

29:59.875 --> 30:01.291
demands to be done

29:59.875 --> 30:01.291
with controlled procedures.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.208
Which Commander Data

30:01.333 --> 30:03.208
is following.

30:03.250 --> 30:05.583
In effective isolation,

30:05.625 --> 30:10.792
and that is what Starfleet

30:05.625 --> 30:10.792
Research finds unacceptable.

30:14.625 --> 30:17.333
So Lal now possesses

30:14.625 --> 30:17.333
the sum of my programming.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.667
Her neural nets

30:17.375 --> 30:19.667
are laid down

30:19.709 --> 30:21.333
identically to yours?

30:21.375 --> 30:24.166
There do seem to be some

30:21.375 --> 30:24.166
variations on the quantum level.

30:24.208 --> 30:25.959
She can use contractions.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.083
I cannot.

30:27.125 --> 30:28.750
An aberration.

30:28.792 --> 30:30.959
What have you done about this?

30:31.000 --> 30:34.250
I have maintained records

30:31.000 --> 30:34.250
on positronic matrix activity,

30:34.291 --> 30:36.834
behavioral norms,

30:34.291 --> 30:36.834
and all verbal patterns.

30:36.875 --> 30:39.458
I have seen no other evidence

30:36.875 --> 30:39.458
of aberrations.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.667
It would seem you have actually

30:39.500 --> 30:42.667
improved upon yourself, Data.

30:42.709 --> 30:45.500
Is that not the goal

30:42.709 --> 30:45.500
of every parent, sir?

30:45.542 --> 30:46.875
But, as a good father,

30:46.917 --> 30:49.208
don't you think

30:46.917 --> 30:49.208
it would be better

30:49.250 --> 30:52.250
especially in the light

30:49.250 --> 30:52.250
of this new aberration

30:52.291 --> 30:53.625
if Lal were close

30:53.667 --> 30:55.500
to people trained

30:53.667 --> 30:55.500
in diagnostic

30:55.542 --> 30:57.250
and evaluative

30:55.542 --> 30:57.250
procedures?

30:57.291 --> 31:00.291
I am programmed with the

30:57.291 --> 31:00.291
procedures you mentioned, sir,

31:00.333 --> 31:03.375
and in any meaningful

31:00.333 --> 31:03.375
evaluation of Lal

31:03.417 --> 31:07.125
you would require a model

31:03.417 --> 31:07.125
for a basis of comparison.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.750
I am the only model available,

31:07.166 --> 31:09.750
Admiral.

31:09.792 --> 31:12.959
You haven't mastered

31:09.792 --> 31:12.959
human cultural

31:13.000 --> 31:15.375
and behavioral norms

31:13.000 --> 31:15.375
yourself yet, have you?

31:15.417 --> 31:16.333
No, sir.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.500
Where is Lal now?

31:28.959 --> 31:33.291
This is your idea of

31:28.959 --> 31:33.291
appropriate guidance?

31:33.333 --> 31:36.125
It is an opportunity for her

31:33.333 --> 31:36.125
to observe human behavior,

31:36.166 --> 31:40.667
and more importantly, for her

31:36.166 --> 31:40.667
to interact with her crewmates.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.041
Thank you.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.625
She is capable of running

31:45.667 --> 31:48.542
over 60 trillion calculations

31:45.667 --> 31:48.542
a second,

31:48.583 --> 31:51.166
and you have her working

31:48.583 --> 31:51.166
as a cocktail waitress.

31:51.208 --> 31:54.834
Admiral, she is under

31:51.208 --> 31:54.834
the strict guidance of a woman

31:54.875 --> 31:57.041
in whom I have absolute trust.

31:57.083 --> 32:00.458
Ten-Forward is the center

31:57.083 --> 32:00.458
of the ship's social activity.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.125
Everyone on board comes here.

32:02.166 --> 32:04.750
I'm not convinced the sort

32:02.166 --> 32:04.750
of behavior she observes here

32:04.792 --> 32:06.583
will be a positive influence.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.000
Well, most people

32:06.625 --> 32:08.000
when they come in here

32:08.041 --> 32:09.750
behave themselves,

32:08.041 --> 32:09.750
and when they don't

32:09.792 --> 32:11.750
I ask them to leave.

32:11.792 --> 32:14.083
Admiral Haftel, Guinan.

32:14.125 --> 32:15.667
She runs Ten-Forward.

32:15.709 --> 32:17.125
How is Lal doing?

32:17.166 --> 32:19.458
Oh, she spills a few

32:17.166 --> 32:19.458
drinks every now and then,

32:19.500 --> 32:20.458
but she's learning.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.750
(<i> woman laughing</i> )

32:21.792 --> 32:24.125
No, I think I've had

32:21.792 --> 32:24.125
enough, thank you.

32:24.166 --> 32:25.208
Excuse me.

32:25.250 --> 32:27.417
I want that android out of here.

32:27.458 --> 32:29.959
Now, Admiral, you've

32:27.458 --> 32:29.959
been in one or two bars

32:30.000 --> 32:31.542
in your time.

32:31.583 --> 32:35.917
Have her report to me

32:31.583 --> 32:35.917
immediately for an interview.

32:54.333 --> 32:57.875
Well, Lal, I've been

32:54.333 --> 32:57.875
looking forward to meeting you.

32:57.917 --> 32:59.458
Why?

32:59.500 --> 33:02.750
You're very important to us

32:59.500 --> 33:02.750
at Starfleet Research.

33:02.792 --> 33:05.583
We have quite a facility

33:02.792 --> 33:05.583
at Galor IV.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.166
I want to show it to you.

33:07.208 --> 33:08.917
In fact, the Admiral

33:07.208 --> 33:08.917
is suggesting

33:08.959 --> 33:11.333
you be moved to Galor IV, Lal.

33:11.375 --> 33:13.542
Have I done

33:11.375 --> 33:13.542
something wrong?

33:13.583 --> 33:15.000
Oh, no, of course not.

33:15.041 --> 33:17.291
We just want to broaden

33:15.041 --> 33:17.291
your experience.

33:17.333 --> 33:20.542
There's only so much

33:17.333 --> 33:20.542
you can learn on a starship.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.583
I'm sure you'll agree to that.

33:22.625 --> 33:23.875
Yes, I'll agree.

33:23.917 --> 33:25.083
Good.

33:25.125 --> 33:27.000
Thus, the natural conclusion

33:25.125 --> 33:27.000
would be

33:27.041 --> 33:30.583
when I have learned all there is

33:27.041 --> 33:30.583
to learn aboard the starship

33:30.625 --> 33:32.291
I would relocate to Galor IV.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.417
That is not

33:32.333 --> 33:35.417
the natural conclusion here.

33:35.458 --> 33:38.542
I believe it is.

33:38.583 --> 33:41.625
You see, Lal, the

33:38.583 --> 33:41.625
Admiral is concerned

33:41.667 --> 33:45.125
that you need

33:41.667 --> 33:45.125
more... guidance

33:45.166 --> 33:46.250
than your father

33:45.166 --> 33:46.250
can provide here

33:46.291 --> 33:47.542
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

33:47.583 --> 33:49.625
Yes, don't misunderstand me.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.417
I have great respect

33:49.667 --> 33:52.417
for your father.

33:52.458 --> 33:54.458
You do not speak

33:52.458 --> 33:54.458
with respect.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.750
She seems very

33:54.500 --> 33:57.750
adversarial.

33:57.792 --> 34:00.291
I'm merely stating a fact,

33:57.792 --> 34:00.291
Admiral.

34:00.333 --> 34:04.834
I don't think your father has

34:00.333 --> 34:04.834
taught you selective judgment

34:04.875 --> 34:08.208
in the verbalization

34:04.875 --> 34:08.208
of your own thoughts.

34:08.250 --> 34:11.875
Now, that is a skill

34:08.250 --> 34:11.875
we will help you develop.

34:11.917 --> 34:14.792
My father is

34:11.917 --> 34:14.792
already helping me, sir.

34:14.834 --> 34:18.250
The question is,

34:14.834 --> 34:18.250
has he helped you enough?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.625
Are you asking me, sir?

34:22.667 --> 34:24.750
No, I didn't mean to ask...

34:24.792 --> 34:26.583
Why don't we, Admiral?

34:26.625 --> 34:28.125
In all these discussions,

34:28.166 --> 34:30.959
no one has ever mentioned

34:28.166 --> 34:30.959
her wishes.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
She's a free, sentient being.

34:33.041 --> 34:35.875
PICARD:

34:33.041 --> 34:35.875
What are your

34:33.041 --> 34:35.875
wishes, Lal?

34:35.917 --> 34:41.000
I wish to remain here,

34:35.917 --> 34:41.000
Captain Picard.

34:44.834 --> 34:46.583
Thank you, Lal.

34:46.625 --> 34:48.166
You're excused.

35:00.375 --> 35:01.458
(<i> door chimes</i> )

35:01.500 --> 35:02.709
Come in.

35:08.834 --> 35:11.041
Hello, Lal.

35:11.083 --> 35:13.208
How are you?

35:13.250 --> 35:14.291
Troi...

35:14.333 --> 35:17.667
Admiral... Admiral...

35:17.709 --> 35:23.291
An admiral from Starfleet

35:17.709 --> 35:23.291
has come to take me away, Troi.

35:23.333 --> 35:25.417
I am scared.

35:25.458 --> 35:28.041
You<i> are</i> scared,

35:25.458 --> 35:28.041
aren't you?

35:31.792 --> 35:35.208
I<i> feel</i> it.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.875
How is this possible?

35:37.917 --> 35:39.959
I don't know.

35:45.417 --> 35:48.709
This is what it

35:45.417 --> 35:48.709
means to feel.

35:51.583 --> 35:57.083
This is what it means...

35:51.583 --> 35:57.083
"feel."

36:06.542 --> 36:12.125
You have Lal off to a wonderful

36:06.542 --> 36:12.125
start in life, Commander.

36:12.166 --> 36:16.375
And that's what being a parent

36:12.166 --> 36:16.375
is all about.

36:16.417 --> 36:18.583
However, I have finally decided

36:18.625 --> 36:21.709
that I must ask you

36:18.625 --> 36:21.709
to release her to me.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.875
May I ask why, sir?

36:23.917 --> 36:25.458
All other arguments aside,

36:25.500 --> 36:27.834
there's one

36:25.500 --> 36:27.834
that is irrefutable.

36:27.875 --> 36:31.625
There are only two Soong-type

36:27.875 --> 36:31.625
androids in existence.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.083
It would be very dangerous

36:33.125 --> 36:34.917
to have you both

36:33.125 --> 36:34.917
in the same place,

36:34.959 --> 36:36.709
especially aboard a starship.

36:36.750 --> 36:40.250
One lucky shot by a Romulan,

36:36.750 --> 36:40.250
we'd lose you both.

36:40.291 --> 36:44.250
Admiral, that is

36:40.291 --> 36:44.250
a fine argument,<i> but...</i>

36:46.083 --> 36:48.083
it doesn't change my feeling

36:48.125 --> 36:51.166
that the proper place

36:48.125 --> 36:51.166
for Lal to develop

36:51.208 --> 36:53.417
is by Data's side.

36:53.458 --> 36:55.458
You're not a parent, Captain.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.500
I am.

36:57.542 --> 37:04.750
I have learned, with difficulty,

36:57.542 --> 37:04.750
that there comes a time when...

37:04.792 --> 37:07.000
There comes a time

37:04.792 --> 37:07.000
when all parents

37:07.041 --> 37:08.375
must give up

37:07.041 --> 37:08.375
their children

37:08.417 --> 37:09.542
for their own good.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.291
But this is not the time.

37:11.333 --> 37:16.208
Damn it, even I can see the...

37:16.250 --> 37:18.792
the umbilical cord

37:16.250 --> 37:18.792
is virtually uncut.

37:18.834 --> 37:21.083
The child...

37:23.917 --> 37:26.959
The child depends on him.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.125
Mr. Data, it would

37:27.000 --> 37:32.125
be better for Lal

37:32.166 --> 37:35.792
if she left knowing that

37:32.166 --> 37:35.792
you had voluntarily decided

37:35.834 --> 37:39.750
that this was the best

37:35.834 --> 37:39.750
course of action.

37:39.792 --> 37:43.166
Admiral, when I

37:39.792 --> 37:43.166
created Lal,

37:43.208 --> 37:45.000
it was in the hope that someday

37:45.041 --> 37:47.166
she would choose

37:45.041 --> 37:47.166
to enter the academy

37:47.208 --> 37:49.417
and become a member

37:47.208 --> 37:49.417
of Starfleet.

37:49.458 --> 37:51.291
I wanted to give something back

37:51.333 --> 37:54.417
in return for all

37:51.333 --> 37:54.417
that Starfleet has given me.

37:54.458 --> 37:57.375
I still do.

37:57.417 --> 38:00.250
But Lal is my child.

38:00.291 --> 38:03.834
You ask that I volunteer

38:00.291 --> 38:03.834
to give her up.

38:03.875 --> 38:05.542
I cannot.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.500
It would violate

38:05.583 --> 38:07.500
every lesson

38:07.542 --> 38:09.959
I have learned

38:07.542 --> 38:09.959
about human parenting.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.542
I have brought a new life

38:10.000 --> 38:13.542
into this world.

38:13.583 --> 38:17.250
And it is<i> my</i> duty,

38:13.583 --> 38:17.250
not Starfleet's

38:17.291 --> 38:21.208
to guide her through these

38:17.291 --> 38:21.208
difficult steps to maturity,

38:21.250 --> 38:23.500
to support her as she learns,

38:23.542 --> 38:28.417
to prepare her to be a

38:23.542 --> 38:28.417
contributing member of society.

38:28.458 --> 38:32.417
No one can relieve me

38:28.458 --> 38:32.417
from that obligation,

38:32.458 --> 38:35.458
and I cannot ignore it.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.041
I am...

38:38.083 --> 38:39.542
her father.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.750
Then I regret

38:45.500 --> 38:47.750
that I must order you

38:47.792 --> 38:50.542
to transport Lal aboard my ship.

38:53.250 --> 38:55.333
Belay that order,

38:53.250 --> 38:55.333
Mr. Data.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.583
I beg your pardon.

38:57.625 --> 39:00.417
I will take this

38:57.625 --> 39:00.417
to Starfleet myself.

39:00.458 --> 39:04.000
<i>I</i> am Starfleet, Captain.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.542
Proceed, Commander.

39:05.583 --> 39:06.834
Hold your ground, Mr. Data.

39:06.875 --> 39:08.834
Captain, you are

39:06.875 --> 39:08.834
jeopardizing

39:08.875 --> 39:10.709
your command and your career.

39:13.500 --> 39:19.959
There are times, sir,

39:13.500 --> 39:19.959
when men of good conscience

39:20.000 --> 39:23.667
cannot blindly follow orders.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.500
You acknowledge their sentience

39:25.542 --> 39:31.917
but you ignore their personal

39:25.542 --> 39:31.917
liberties and freedom.

39:31.959 --> 39:34.166
(<i> sighs</i> )

39:34.208 --> 39:38.834
Order a man to hand his child

39:34.208 --> 39:38.834
over to the state?

39:38.875 --> 39:41.375
Not while I am his Captain.

39:41.417 --> 39:43.166
If you wish,

39:43.208 --> 39:45.417
you can accompany us

39:43.208 --> 39:45.417
to Starfleet, where we shall...

39:45.458 --> 39:46.959
TROI:

39:45.458 --> 39:46.959
Troi to Commander Data.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.458
Report to your lab at once.

39:50.542 --> 39:51.834
Acknowledged, Counselor.

39:51.875 --> 39:54.250
He's on his way.

39:51.875 --> 39:54.250
Is there a problem?

39:54.291 --> 39:59.125
Yes, Captain, something

39:54.291 --> 39:59.125
is terribly wrong with Lal.

40:01.250 --> 40:03.375
TROI:

40:01.250 --> 40:03.375
It lasted

40:01.250 --> 40:03.375
barely a moment.

40:03.417 --> 40:05.208
She experienced

40:03.417 --> 40:05.208
fear and confusion

40:05.250 --> 40:07.917
and then, for no

40:05.250 --> 40:07.917
apparent reason

40:07.959 --> 40:09.625
she walked out

40:07.959 --> 40:09.625
of my quarters.

40:09.667 --> 40:11.208
She didn't say

40:09.667 --> 40:11.208
another word.

40:11.250 --> 40:14.291
She just started

40:11.250 --> 40:14.291
walking here and

40:11.250 --> 40:14.291
each step became

40:14.333 --> 40:15.417
more and more

40:14.333 --> 40:15.417
difficult.

40:15.458 --> 40:16.834
Lal is programmed

40:16.875 --> 40:20.709
to return to the lab

40:16.875 --> 40:20.709
in the event of a malfunction.

40:20.750 --> 40:21.709
Father?

40:21.750 --> 40:24.000
Yes, Lal, I am here.

40:24.041 --> 40:27.000
A malfunction...

40:27.041 --> 40:28.917
emotional awareness.

40:28.959 --> 40:31.667
It appears to be a symptom

40:28.959 --> 40:31.667
of cascade failure.

40:31.709 --> 40:34.417
It would require initialization

40:31.709 --> 40:34.417
of the base matrix

40:34.458 --> 40:36.750
without wiping out

40:34.458 --> 40:36.750
higher functions.

40:36.792 --> 40:39.083
I agree.

40:39.125 --> 40:42.750
May I assist?

40:42.792 --> 40:44.500
Thank you, Admiral.

40:44.542 --> 40:45.875
If you'll excuse us,

40:45.917 --> 40:49.834
Commander Data and I

40:45.917 --> 40:49.834
have much to do.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.375
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

40:56.417 --> 40:58.667
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

41:03.250 --> 41:05.709
(<i> click</i> )

41:07.000 --> 41:09.166
(<i> beeping</i> )

41:19.125 --> 41:20.792
(<i> door opens</i> )

41:27.375 --> 41:28.583
She...

41:28.625 --> 41:31.583
she won't survive much longer.

41:31.625 --> 41:35.417
There was nothing

41:31.625 --> 41:35.417
anyone could have done.

41:35.458 --> 41:42.125
We'd repolarize one pathway,

41:35.458 --> 41:42.125
and another would collapse.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.709
And then another.

41:45.750 --> 41:51.041
His hands... were moving faster

41:45.750 --> 41:51.041
than I could see,

41:51.083 --> 41:54.667
trying to stay ahead

41:51.083 --> 41:54.667
of each breakdown.

41:54.709 --> 41:56.500
He refused to give up.

41:56.542 --> 42:00.333
He was remarkable.

42:03.709 --> 42:07.709
It just... wasn't meant to be.

42:13.667 --> 42:20.542
Lal, I am unable to correct

42:13.667 --> 42:20.542
the system failure.

42:20.583 --> 42:22.667
I know.

42:22.709 --> 42:25.709
We must say good-bye now.

42:28.667 --> 42:30.125
I feel...

42:32.000 --> 42:35.583
What do you feel, Lal?

42:35.625 --> 42:38.709
I love you, Father.

42:46.041 --> 42:49.333
I wish I could

42:46.041 --> 42:49.333
feel it with you.

42:49.375 --> 42:53.834
I will feel it

42:49.375 --> 42:53.834
for both of us.

42:56.291 --> 42:59.709
Thank you for my life.

43:03.250 --> 43:06.375
Flirting.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.542
Laughter.

43:08.583 --> 43:12.959
Painting, family.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.750
Female.

43:15.792 --> 43:17.500
Human...

43:24.834 --> 43:30.000
Lal suffered complete neural

43:24.834 --> 43:30.000
system failure at 1300 hours.

43:30.041 --> 43:32.291
I have deactivated the unit.

43:34.750 --> 43:37.917
The crew is saddened

43:34.750 --> 43:37.917
by your loss, Mr. Data.

43:40.333 --> 43:47.458
I thank you for your sympathy,

43:40.333 --> 43:47.458
but... she is here.

43:47.500 --> 43:50.083
Her presence so enriched my life

43:50.125 --> 43:53.000
that I could not allow her

43:50.125 --> 43:53.000
to pass into oblivion.

43:53.041 --> 43:57.834
So I incorporated her programs

43:53.041 --> 43:57.834
back into my own.

43:57.875 --> 44:02.125
I have transferred

43:57.875 --> 44:02.125
her memories to me.

44:04.458 --> 44:07.083
Mr. Data, will you

44:04.458 --> 44:07.083
take your position.

44:10.291 --> 44:12.166
Mr. Crusher,

44:12.208 --> 44:16.333
lay in a course

44:12.208 --> 44:16.333
for the Starbase on Otar II.

44:19.041 --> 44:22.417
WESLEY:

44:19.041 --> 44:22.417
Course is set, sir.

44:22.458 --> 44:24.583
PICARD:

44:22.458 --> 44:24.583
Engage.
