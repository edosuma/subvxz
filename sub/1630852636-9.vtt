-[beeps]

00:21.104 --> 00:22.313
[door opens]

01:15.784 --> 01:17.118
You ready to talk?

01:20.622 --> 01:21.706
[gulps]

01:27.921 --> 01:31.299
Why do you choose everyone else
over your family?

01:38.431 --> 01:39.933
That's not what happened.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.063
You're so desperate to be the good guy.

01:47.148 --> 01:50.151
I didn't know she was gonna kill him.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.947
Then you're a fucking idiot.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.618
The second you saw her in Chicago.

02:00.286 --> 02:05.041
[Marty] And you're the one
that called Javi to go there.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.126
Not me.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.712
Because it was inevitable.

02:12.006 --> 02:12.924
[Marty] Mnh-mnh.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.845
No, it wasn't.
I could've talked her out of that.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.266
You can't possibly believe that.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.812
And then… you apologize.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.648
For what?

02:44.372 --> 02:47.917
She's lost her whole family, Wendy.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.383
I mean, her entire life is destroyed…

02:57.010 --> 02:59.804
because she met us.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.311
This is it. This is what you do.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.314
[Marty] What?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.276
Find excuses to feel like shit.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.698
That doesn't make sense.

03:18.781 --> 03:19.908
[Wendy] I know.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.994
It's baffling.

03:23.745 --> 03:28.041
I mean, who wants to carry everyone
else's responsibilities and not their own?

03:28.124 --> 03:29.042
I don't--

03:29.125 --> 03:33.713
I-I don't even understand
what you're avoiding half the time.

03:33.796 --> 03:37.133
Happiness? Success? I-I don't know.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.678
I'm just sick of having
blood on my hands, Wendy.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.264
Doesn't-- doesn't-- It doesn't bother you?

03:46.267 --> 03:48.228
[Wendy] You suggested this life.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.356
Long time ago.

03:53.316 --> 03:57.362
[Wendy] You knew better than me
what this was.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.406
They cut out a man's eyes in front of you.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.246
Hey, I got us into this.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.457
You're getting us out of this. Yeah.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.292
We…

04:12.543 --> 04:14.170
We chose this together.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.925
Nobody talked you into this.
You were excited about this.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.265
You were a good salesman.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.226
Yeah, okay.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.149
[sniffles]

04:35.233 --> 04:36.317
[exhales]

04:37.318 --> 04:38.152
[sniffles]

04:43.616 --> 04:45.076
You-- you want a lot.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.455
Tell me how much is enough.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.499
We had it.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.546
Five hours ago, we had it.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.924
You threw it away.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.927
We were clean.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.264
We were out.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.599
[Marty] We can still get out.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.185
With what?

05:12.603 --> 05:13.604
[scoffs]

05:16.733 --> 05:18.568
-With our lives.
-[Wendy] Oh!

05:19.569 --> 05:20.903
So noble.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.662
Don't back out on me
when we're almost done.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.997
Don't do that to me.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.124
Wendy.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.252
We gotta be realistic. Come on.

05:36.878 --> 05:37.837
[Wendy] No.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.423
We have to be ambitious.

05:45.428 --> 05:49.807
Without Javi,
we can't get the drugs to Clare.

05:50.433 --> 05:56.981
The foundation will dry up
well before you can rally more donors.

05:57.565 --> 06:01.069
Something has gotta give.
We gotta give this up, this…

06:02.862 --> 06:06.074
Chicago. Politics.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.700
We can't have it all.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.702
I mean, we don't know what's in Mexico.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.289
What's-- what's-- who's coming up for us?
What-- what do they want?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.624
Then we find out.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.210
We get protection first.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.925
I'm not falling on my sword
because you fucked up, Marty.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.141
-You might not have a choice.
-[Wendy] No, no, no.

06:32.725 --> 06:36.104
I'm not letting go of anything
until I know it's impossible.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.065
If you loved me, you'd do the same.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.158
Have some fucking faith.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.705
Have some fucking faith.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.150
[door closes]

07:33.286 --> 07:34.287
Hey.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.497
Did you do it?

07:40.585 --> 07:41.919
Are you okay?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.130
Are you?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.177
She isn't in the office today.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.472
She okay?
She's not answering my calls. [chuckles]

08:34.555 --> 08:36.474
What exactly did you expect?

08:38.935 --> 08:41.479
We can still get her what she needs.
The deal can still happen.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.315
Just make sure she knows.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.068
Go home.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.740
[Mel] It's gotten kind of,
um, complicated.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.368
How-- how much
do you know about your wife's work?

08:56.202 --> 08:59.205
She-- she's a corporate lawyer.
It's not that interesting.

09:00.623 --> 09:04.627
Well, in this case,
it, uh, kind of is. Um…

09:06.420 --> 09:09.257
Look, I'm-- I'm so sorry
to have to be the one to land this on you,

09:09.340 --> 09:13.094
but my contact at the FBI says that Helen…

09:14.262 --> 09:16.222
worked for a drug cartel.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.350
[chuckles] What? No.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.310
Yeah, they think maybe she's missing

09:21.394 --> 09:25.898
because cartel lawyers
kind of have a habit of going missing.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.403
-They think she's dead?
-[Mel] Yeah.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.322
-And, uh, so do I.
-[inhales]

09:33.906 --> 09:35.658
[Mel] I'm so sorry. You know, I--

09:36.867 --> 09:38.661
I wasn't expecting this.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.916
Well, we thought maybe
something had happened, but…

09:46.752 --> 09:50.965
[sighs] Uh, wh-- when
did this start, the cartel?

09:51.048 --> 09:53.884
Well, I can get you that info,
but here's the thing.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.305
I'm not so sure this went down in Mexico.

10:02.518 --> 10:06.188
She-- she went out
on her own 15 years ago. She--

10:07.440 --> 10:11.402
She, uh, suddenly it was trips every week.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.030
-She didn't wanna talk about anything.
-I can get you more answers.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.533
I just need a couple,
maybe, uh, three more weeks.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.576
No, Dad.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.244
I said stay in your room.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.787
[Erin] If Mom worked for a cartel,

10:21.871 --> 10:24.373
it could be really dangerous
for us to know anything, couldn't it?

10:24.457 --> 10:28.210
That's what I'm saying is that I'm not
100% sure that the cartel did this.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.504
Now, her business partners
down in the Ozarks,

10:30.588 --> 10:31.839
they're hiding something.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.593
This, uh,
you know, brother who disappeared.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.762
Dad, listen, we don't need to know.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.057
It's okay if we don't know.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.393
Finding out would help
push this divorce through.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.853
That-- that can wait.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.815
-Olivia left.
-[Mel exhales] Shit. I'm sorry.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.568
[chuckles] But, uh,
you know, millennials are fickle.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.278
She could come back and then what?

10:54.362 --> 10:55.613
You can't propose.

10:55.696 --> 10:59.075
Also, besides the point,
something happened to Helen here,

10:59.158 --> 11:03.579
and I can find evidence
that would unlock her finances.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.790
Dad, please let it go.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.424
[Gene grunts] Uh…

11:16.133 --> 11:18.427
Thanks so much
for all your hard work, Mr. Sattem.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.848
-If you change your mind, I--
-We won't.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.194
[door opens, closes]

11:37.071 --> 11:38.072
How'd it go?

11:38.864 --> 11:40.157
[Wendy] Ruth killed Javi.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.619
Have you seen Jonah?

11:46.163 --> 11:47.498
-No.
-No?

11:47.581 --> 11:49.583
He told Ruth where we were.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.004
-Is she okay?
-She's alive.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.549
I-I can't believe he would do this.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.134
It's just beyond.

12:04.014 --> 12:04.849
Mom.

12:06.976 --> 12:07.893
No.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.772
-Charlotte!
-I'm sorry, Mom.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.817
-I-I didn't mean it.
-Why would you do that?

12:14.900 --> 12:17.903
I was upset about Wyatt,
and-- and Ruth, she…

12:18.487 --> 12:19.572
I wasn't thinking.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.324
-And she was so upset and angry--
-You were trying to help.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.743
[Wendy sighs]

12:24.326 --> 12:25.786
I didn't think that she would do it.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.788
No, you weren't thinking at all!

12:28.789 --> 12:29.749
[Charlotte] Mom.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.168
I'm sorry.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.423
The FBI are here.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.177
Go.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.016
[Hannah] His plane
never left the airfield.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.059
All of his clothes
were left in his hotel room.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.521
Did he mention anything
when you saw him in Chicago?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.149
No, and-- and we didn't talk that long.

12:55.232 --> 12:59.612
Uh, he-- he wanted some advice
on some financial situation,

12:59.695 --> 13:02.156
and, uh, we were there on other business,
so we sat down with--

13:02.239 --> 13:05.951
He did say he was gonna meet
with a former professor for dinner.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.789
Tell us what this means for our deal.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.916
There isn't one.

13:13.292 --> 13:17.254
Your freedom from prosecution relied upon
Mr. Elizondro fulfilling his agreement.

13:17.338 --> 13:21.091
Without him, I'm afraid
you're back where you started.

13:22.134 --> 13:22.968
[exhales]

13:23.761 --> 13:27.097
I still have access
to very useful information.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.850
[Hannah] We have enough CIs, Mr. Byrde.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.395
You both need to think clearly here.

13:33.479 --> 13:38.359
This death will create an extremely
unstable situation in the Navarro cartel,

13:38.442 --> 13:41.111
and you were the last people
to see Javi Elizondro alive.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.655
It doesn't look good.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.615
I can help.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.244
If you're willing
to testify against Omar Navarro,

13:48.327 --> 13:50.579
I can get you into witness protection.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.498
We don't want that.

13:53.666 --> 13:58.337
Agent Clay, 24 hours ago,
we had a deal that we were all happy with.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.713
How do we get that back?

13:59.797 --> 14:03.759
Unfortunately, Agent Miller's actions
have rendered that impossible.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.011
What about extradition?

14:07.179 --> 14:10.099
If we can get Navarro back to-- to Mexico,

14:10.182 --> 14:12.059
he can buy his way out of prison.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.061
He can be reinstated
as head of the cartel,

14:14.144 --> 14:17.189
then everything we agreed on
can move forward as planned.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.442
Your reach
is exceeding your grasp, Mrs. Byrde.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.320
Navarro was always the better choice.

14:24.780 --> 14:25.990
He's more stable.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.243
He knows the cartel inside and out.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.161
That is true.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.666
Even if we did pull strings at Justice
to approve extradition,

14:35.749 --> 14:38.752
Omar Navarro is
a specially designated national.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.921
He's on the SDN list.

14:41.005 --> 14:45.259
That makes extradition incredibly
difficult, politically and practically.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.344
There must be a process
to get his name removed.

14:47.428 --> 14:52.224
[Hannah] There is, but it takes
some deft political maneuvering and time.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.061
The cartel will be at war with itself
or under new management by then.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.147
What use is Navarro
if he doesn't have power?

14:58.731 --> 15:01.066
All we'll have done
is to set free a drug lord.

15:01.692 --> 15:05.279
And what would it take to prove
to the FBI that he's still in control?

15:05.821 --> 15:07.072
Money.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.699
[chuckles]

15:08.782 --> 15:11.785
[Hannah] If you
can keep the seizures coming in,

15:11.869 --> 15:14.622
I can convince
my bosses this is worth the risk,

15:14.705 --> 15:16.749
but that doesn't make it a good plan.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.835
I need to sit down with Navarro.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.378
Hmm. Wendy.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.006
You do understand
the danger that you're in?

15:24.715 --> 15:27.676
Witness protection is
by far the safer choice here.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.180
Just get me in to see him.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.474
[scoffs]

15:34.975 --> 15:35.976
Okay.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.122
-Stay here.
-Yeah.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.422
How'd you get in here?

16:08.425 --> 16:11.637
Ms. Shaw, I represent
Javi Elizondro's stone and tile company.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.430
Tell him to get back in the car.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.688
I was just wondering, Ms. Shaw,
if you've seen Mr. Elizondro

16:20.771 --> 16:22.564
since your meeting yesterday.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.243
I haven't. I'm sorry.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.829
What's happened?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.707
Are you sure?

16:40.207 --> 16:43.877
He sent a message late last night to say
he'd secured a sweetener to your deal.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.630
We spoke on the phone.

16:46.714 --> 16:50.843
He wanted stock options for his mother.
I confirmed we'd make that happen.

16:52.302 --> 16:53.387
Is he all right?

16:54.471 --> 16:55.931
Are you sure you didn't meet?

16:56.515 --> 16:59.393
It was yesterday. I'd remember.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.938
Well, if you change your mind…

17:04.148 --> 17:06.066
I'll be in town until we find him.

Uh, yeah. Oh, hi. H-how are you?

18:01.330 --> 18:02.164
Uh-huh.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.918
Uh, no. Yeah, sure.

18:06.835 --> 18:10.089
I'd be, uh, very interested.
When-- when do you get in?

18:14.176 --> 18:17.596
No, uh, it's perfect.
I can, uh, be in the Ozarks today.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.681
I'll text you an address.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.232

18:41.245 --> 18:44.123
You wanna tell me
why I'm babysitting a missing kid?

18:44.706 --> 18:46.542
It's all over the news.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.920
Your cousin and Mrs. Snell,
this is their baby, right?

18:50.796 --> 18:55.050
God love you, Ruth, but I can't be found
with a missing child at my home.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.844
I-I'm sorry. I-I didn't know.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.057
Oh, thanks. Thanks for watching him.

19:04.768 --> 19:05.894

where you been the last 24 hours?

20:12.419 --> 20:14.046
Do that kid a favor.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.633
Do not let Wendy Byrde get a hold of him.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.093
He deserves a good family.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.347
Are you ready to make a formal statement?

20:24.598 --> 20:29.728
I told you on the phone.
I didn't see nothing. I-I just found them.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.564
I went over with a wedding present.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.275
Had you seen him earlier in the day?

20:35.859 --> 20:37.694
She didn't want me at the wedding.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.114
Where'd you go after you called me?

20:42.491 --> 20:43.492
Nowhere.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.703
I was-- I was getting my head straight.

20:49.206 --> 20:53.085
And, um, uh, I-I'm sorry about Zeke.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.337
I-I wasn't watching the news.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.756
Ruth, I know
you were working with Darlene.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.425
So, was this a drug hit?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.846
-I don't know anything about that.
-Don't lie to me.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.306
I'm not.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.267
[Guerrero] Who was she fighting with?

21:10.477 --> 21:12.437

21:13.855 --> 21:14.898
I don't.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.026
[Guerrero] You think
you're being smart right now.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.528
You're not.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.656
And you're looking
more and more like a suspect.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.491
Believe what you want.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.994
I didn't do it. I don't know who did.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.788
If you want me to solve this,
you need to speak up.

21:30.497 --> 21:35.002

but you gotta give me something.

But don't even think about
keeping Darlene's business going.

You understand? Do not get in my way.

but they can blackball me.

22:37.397 --> 22:38.565

22:41.568 --> 22:43.528
Navarro's nephew is dead.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.198
And?

22:50.285 --> 22:53.246
And-- and you offered me a deal once.

22:54.373 --> 22:59.628
And it could give
my family and me, uh, protection.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.924
I'll do the time. I'll do-- I'll do
the 18 months just like you wanted.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.551
I'll come in here. I'll work for you.

You've seen it.

you think Wendy would go for it?

No more casino, husband with a record,

23:18.397 --> 23:20.941
wave goodbye
to your big family foundation.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.445
We're in a lot of danger.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.364
That's your choice.

23:29.324 --> 23:32.327
You didn't need to arrest Navarro.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.412
Don't.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.416
Any help I offered in the past,

24:46.860 --> 24:48.904
I met with the FBI this morning.

24:51.698 --> 24:55.243
Your nephew has disappeared.
They think he's been killed.

24:58.538 --> 24:59.539
Who?

[Wendy] They don't know.

But you do.

[Wendy] No.

25:12.385 --> 25:15.347
What this does, though,
is present an opportunity.

Extradition is
a very real option for you now.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.769
The FBI are on board.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.104
All we have to do
is get you off the SDN list

25:23.188 --> 25:25.315
and establish that
you're still in control.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.694
If I wasn't handcuffed to this table
right now, Wendy, I would kill you.

You and your piece of shit husband

25:45.835 --> 25:49.005
and your pathetic kids
are all dead, Wendy.

25:49.756 --> 25:50.882
You're in solitary.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.009
I will find a way to get a message out.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.595
[Wendy] No, you won't.
Not if I have anything to do with it.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.306

Well, that's all any of us wants.

Of course. Um, just wanna be
upfront with you, Nathan.

Um, you know, PIs aren't always
in the habit of bringing good news.

27:00.535 --> 27:04.372
Truth, yeah, I'll get that,
but just want you to be prepared.

28:22.951 --> 28:23.993
He's interested.

28:25.161 --> 28:26.371
Really?

28:26.454 --> 28:29.999
Yes, but he wants a show of good faith
with everything that's been going on,

28:30.083 --> 28:31.668
just to get things rolling.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.420
Such as?

28:34.462 --> 28:37.298
We have to get him out of solitary
and back into protective custody.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.218
I can do that.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.430
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.349
But he has to know
that it was us that got him out.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.143
He has to know that.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.353
All right.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.314

Um, hang on.
That's, uh, that's-- that's great.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.671
Um, how was he?

29:18.715 --> 29:20.049
Angry.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.261
But he's smart.
He knows a good deal when he hears it.

29:25.638 --> 29:28.808
Um, we-- we have another problem.
Your dad's here.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.060
He's searching for Ben.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.030
[Wendy] No, I'm not saying that. It's--

29:42.614 --> 29:44.365
It's very thoughtful that you've come.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.911
What else would I do? My son is missing.

29:47.994 --> 29:49.287
Not a peep from you.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.289
I'm sorry, Dad. It's just…

29:53.666 --> 29:55.084
There's been no news.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.630
Um, and, honestly, w-what could you do
that the sheriff's office couldn't?

29:58.713 --> 30:00.173
We've hired a PI.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.218

30:05.470 --> 30:08.306
Uh, Mel Sattem?

30:08.807 --> 30:10.683
You know him? Good!

30:12.227 --> 30:13.895
Yes. Yeah, we do.

30:14.437 --> 30:17.732
Um, did he tell you why he left the force?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.652
He got caught stealing cocaine out
of an evidence locker, Dad.

30:20.735 --> 30:21.986
He's an addict.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.492
Well, his references are excellent,

30:27.575 --> 30:30.286
so clearly he's overcome his issues.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.581
That's very forgiving.

-Harry has been calling you.

32:38.039 --> 32:38.957
Um…

32:42.335 --> 32:45.213
You know, they-- they sent Wyatt to us.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.968
I just need to know what you wanna do.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.597
What Wyatt wanted.

33:04.691 --> 33:07.276
You think
an 18-year-old had a plan for that?

33:10.071 --> 33:11.114
Yeah, well…

33:13.032 --> 33:14.534
-It's, uh…
-[clears throat]

33:15.410 --> 33:16.244

33:19.664 --> 33:21.916
-[clears throat, sniffles]
-[music stops]

33:22.000 --> 33:23.918
It's-- it's not that many decisions.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.296
You know, we can do it all right here.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.342
I can, uh, handle it if you want.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.554
I'll make sure it's done right, okay?

33:38.016 --> 33:39.225
Ruth, okay?

33:54.574 --> 33:55.658
Okay.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.567
Hi, Clare. It's Wendy.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.321
Look, I-I can appreciate
how upset you must be,

34:33.404 --> 34:36.157
but the foundation
is still expecting its next installment,

34:36.240 --> 34:38.117
and I would hate to have to tell anyone

34:38.201 --> 34:41.162
that Shaw Medical doesn't
make good on their promises, so…

34:41.871 --> 34:43.247
Call me back, Clare.

34:47.001 --> 34:51.422
Um, is pressuring her a good idea?

34:51.506 --> 34:54.926
I mean, we don't even know
if we can get it over the border yet.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.761
He'll make it happen.

34:59.722 --> 35:01.015
Did you call Rettelsdorf?

35:01.766 --> 35:03.392
He's not picking up either.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.814
I'm taking it one catastrophe at a time.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.566
Don't set a place for me. I'm going out.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.818
Where?

35:11.901 --> 35:14.403
[Charlotte] Dinner with Grandpa
and his girlfriend.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.371
Yep, yeah, yeah.

35:29.210 --> 35:33.631
Good Shepherd would be happy to host
an event unless you had something planned.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.342
[hesitates] Not yet.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.511
It's important to keep these things
in the headlines.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.513
You know, people forget so quickly.

35:40.596 --> 35:44.016
Um, and we wanna keep
Mr. Sattem on as long as we can.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.227
I met Sheriff Guerrero today.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.647
She told me about that couple
that organized Ben's posters.

35:49.730 --> 35:50.857
What a tragedy.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.817
Wyatt was a friend.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.778
He was actually the cousin
of a girl that Ben was dating. Ruth.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.822
[Jonah] Do we know
when the funeral is yet?

35:58.865 --> 36:01.576
Actually just started
organizing that today.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.244
We're-- we're gonna help out.

36:03.327 --> 36:06.581
How awful.
To lose friends on top of everything.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.333
Um, I'm so sorry for your loss.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.170
But aren't you lucky
you have Nathan here to help?

36:12.253 --> 36:14.881
Well, now, let's not
lay it on too thick, Annalise.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.757
We all know I haven't been here enough.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.219
But I aim to set that straight. [exhales]

36:20.303 --> 36:24.599
I see how busy you are
with your various businesses,

36:24.682 --> 36:28.311
and, uh, on top of that,
trying to raise a family in the right way.

36:28.394 --> 36:30.605
That's hard work for anybody.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.814
I wanna help.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.692
[Marty] We appreciate that.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.736
[Annalise] You know,
Nathan was such a big support

36:36.819 --> 36:38.779
when my daughter
got into trouble last year.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.948
[chuckles] I mean,
nothing serious, of course.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.533
Of course not.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.369
Well, I had some practice.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.788
[laughs]

36:47.872 --> 36:51.334
Did your mother ever tell you about
the time that she ran away from home?

36:51.417 --> 36:53.419
What were you? Ten?

36:54.003 --> 36:56.172
She talked her way
onto a bus to Kingsport.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.882
She thought that sounded fancy.

36:58.549 --> 36:59.800
That was Wendy.

36:59.884 --> 37:03.262
Grass was always greener,
even back then, right?

37:06.599 --> 37:09.352
Your uncle and I spent
the entire night looking for her.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.062
He cried the whole time.

37:11.145 --> 37:12.939
Couldn't stop. You remember that?

37:13.022 --> 37:14.023
I was on the bus.

37:14.106 --> 37:15.733
[Nathan] Poor kid begged her not to leave.

37:15.816 --> 37:19.528
It was the same thing when you left
for Chicago. Ben cried his heart out.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.407
That boy worshipped you
for a minute there, didn't he?

37:23.491 --> 37:25.785
You know, we should go.

37:25.868 --> 37:29.497
I have an early start,
so you all just enjoy your dinner.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.123
[Annalise] Oh. Goodbye.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.751
-Is she okay?
-She's fine.

37:34.752 --> 37:35.711
Should I come?

37:35.795 --> 37:38.214
[Marty] No, no, uh, stay.
Bring the-- bring the boat back.

37:38.297 --> 37:39.924
Uh, Annalise, pleasure to meet you.

37:40.007 --> 37:43.094
Nathan, dinner is on us, okay?

37:45.388 --> 37:47.223
You know, for all his problems,

37:47.974 --> 37:50.810
Ben always was the more stable
of my children.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.939
[Wendy] He's gonna poison them against us.

37:58.567 --> 37:59.443
We won't let him.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.196
You know the part of that story
he never tells?

38:02.280 --> 38:05.908
When we got back, he hit me
so hard I couldn't walk for two days.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.535
That's why Ben was crying.

38:10.871 --> 38:11.872
I'm sorry.

38:15.501 --> 38:16.919
We've done worse.

38:17.586 --> 38:19.255
-No. No, we haven't.
-[scoffs]

38:20.631 --> 38:22.675
We've completely derailed their lives.

38:22.758 --> 38:25.803
Did you see Charlotte
when we told her we were out?

38:25.886 --> 38:29.557
It-- it was as if
the whole world opened back up for her.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.976
It's not enough for us just to survive.

38:32.643 --> 38:35.229
If we don't get out clean,
they'll never forgive us.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.195
I have something that I need to tell you.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.490
[sighs]

38:47.575 --> 38:51.370
I wanna believe that--
that we can get it all back. I do.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.915
I-I want us to get out,
but, Wendy, I'm scared.

38:57.585 --> 38:58.586
And?

38:59.086 --> 39:04.633
And I-I went to go see Maya today
to ask about the deal.

39:05.259 --> 39:08.554
Uh, I thought that it would protect us.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.391
And what did she say?

39:14.685 --> 39:16.520
She turned me down.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.649
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

39:24.779 --> 39:25.780
It's okay.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.658
You're telling me now.

39:32.953 --> 39:33.871
She's lying.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.335
The day Ben left the Ozarks,
Wendy Byrde rented this car.

39:40.252 --> 39:41.253
You got it.

39:42.129 --> 39:46.175
Picked it up on the 44,
but I ran out of luck after Rolla.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.928
Local forces won't do shit for a PI.

39:49.011 --> 39:51.263
It's like I'm asking 'em
to give me a kidney.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.183
[exhales] I miss being a cop.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.854
So what do you think? Can you help
now that you're a big shot in the FBI?

39:59.355 --> 40:00.773
You'd be surprised.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.777
Not everyone's happy with what I did.

40:06.153 --> 40:07.780
[Mel] You kidding? That's crazy.

40:08.697 --> 40:10.074
It's complicated.

40:10.866 --> 40:12.618
But, yeah, I'll see what I can do.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.787
Same goes for you.

40:14.870 --> 40:18.624
If you find anything
on the Byrdes' Foundation, you pass it on.

40:19.375 --> 40:23.087
I tell you what. Uh, I find
something first, you buy me dinner.

40:23.170 --> 40:26.215
You find something first, it's on me.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.511
Are you flirting with me?

40:30.594 --> 40:31.637
Yeah.

40:33.389 --> 40:34.432
How am I doing?

40:35.182 --> 40:38.102
-Terribly.
-[laughs] No way. I'm killing it.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.312
[chuckles]

40:48.571 --> 40:49.947
[keys jangle]

40:51.031 --> 40:53.033
-[lock clicks]
-[buzzer sounds]

40:55.619 --> 40:57.329
[guard] You're moving to gen pop.

41:00.499 --> 41:01.792
[Omar grunts]

41:09.467 --> 41:11.218
I need to make a phone call.

41:28.569 --> 41:29.778
[Marty] You guys okay?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.281
Marty.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.285
Hi. I didn't know that you were coming.

41:36.368 --> 41:38.037
Well, kids asked me.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.081
I think they just need a bit of support.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.833
Hmm, yeah. Sure, sure, yeah.

41:42.917 --> 41:45.753
-No Wendy?
-Uh, no, no, she had to work.

41:45.836 --> 41:46.754
[Nathan] Ah.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.625
[gasps]

42:24.708 --> 42:27.670
-Not here. Please, just not here.
-It's okay.

42:27.753 --> 42:29.547
We're just here to talk.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.759
Father Benitez. We almost met once before.

42:37.179 --> 42:41.225
I never know him to change
his mind about a thing like this.

42:41.308 --> 42:47.106
And I have tried very hard for many years
to talk him out of many, many things.

42:47.189 --> 42:48.440
What's your secret?

42:52.486 --> 42:54.697
All I did was present the facts.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.574
[chuckles]

42:58.492 --> 43:02.955
Sí. Do you--
do you really believe you can get him out?

43:04.290 --> 43:05.916
[hesitates] I want to try.

43:07.668 --> 43:08.794
You sure?

43:12.214 --> 43:13.924
W-what do you mean?

43:14.717 --> 43:16.594
You believe in God, Wendy?

43:18.178 --> 43:22.057
It's a little early
in the day for theology.

43:22.141 --> 43:23.350
[chuckles]

43:25.603 --> 43:27.855
You were raised with religion then.

43:29.982 --> 43:31.900
I-I-I think…

43:32.901 --> 43:36.488
Omar's arrest is an opportunity
for all of you.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.908
You and your husband should seize it.

43:39.992 --> 43:45.706
So rare a cartel member gets a chance
to make their peace with God.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.084
I can help you find a way.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.296
I made my peace a long time ago.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.590
No, no, espéreme. No, Wendy, no.

43:54.673 --> 44:01.430
There is no peace without contrition,
confession, absolution and penance.

44:02.222 --> 44:03.724
I think you know that.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.852
I appreciate your effort.

44:09.813 --> 44:11.482
I don't need to be saved.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.069
I'll do that myself.

44:15.653 --> 44:16.612
You can try.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.413
He'll see you both tomorrow.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.583
Does Omar know
you wanna keep him in prison?

44:32.795 --> 44:34.213
He knows I love him.

44:36.006 --> 44:38.092
May God find you, Wendy.

44:51.897 --> 44:54.525
[gasps]

44:54.608 --> 44:55.609
[sniffles]

44:57.778 --> 44:59.780
[shuddering]

45:01.198 --> 45:02.324
[panting]

45:11.166 --> 45:16.255
[preacher] Today, we are gathered together
to say our farewell to Wyatt Langmore.

45:17.297 --> 45:18.966
On behalf of Wyatt's family,

45:19.049 --> 45:22.469
I would like
to thank you all for coming today.

45:23.971 --> 45:29.184
Not only have we sensed our own personal
feelings of loss over Wyatt's passing…

45:29.268 --> 45:32.229
[Wyatt laughing]

45:37.776 --> 45:39.653
-[Ruth clears throat]
-[Wyatt continues laughing]

45:39.737 --> 45:40.821
[Ruth] No!

45:40.904 --> 45:43.657
[screaming]

45:45.617 --> 45:49.663
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! [shouts]

45:49.747 --> 45:53.751
[preacher] …remind you there's a shadow
that has been cast over humanity.

45:55.127 --> 46:00.716
As Paul said,
"Through one man, sin entered the world,

46:01.383 --> 46:07.139
and death through sin,
and thus death spread to all men."

46:07.931 --> 46:10.142
But death doesn't merely remind us

46:10.225 --> 46:13.353
of the universal nature
of mankind's problems.

46:14.146 --> 46:18.442
God did not leave us
in the valley or under the shadow.

46:19.193 --> 46:22.863
We realize that God had a solution,

46:22.946 --> 46:26.033
something greater
than the painful reminder.

46:26.116 --> 46:28.535
We realize that God acted on behalf

46:28.619 --> 46:32.539
and provided us
for a greater answer to our need.

46:32.623 --> 46:35.918
-The precious wisdom lies in Psalms.
-[Ruth grunts]

46:36.001 --> 46:39.838
"Yea, though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death,

46:39.922 --> 46:41.799
I shall fear no evil."

46:46.678 --> 46:48.764
-[man] Oh, man.
-[Charlotte] Oh, he loved to get high.

46:48.847 --> 46:50.933
[man 2] Yeah, that and pretty blondes.

46:51.016 --> 46:54.311
-[Charlotte] Oh, ho!
-[man 2] So you have weed and blonde hair?

46:55.020 --> 46:57.272
-[man laughs]
-[Charlotte] I knew he was a good friend.

46:57.356 --> 46:59.525
'Cause I lowballed him on weed
so many times.

46:59.608 --> 47:01.527
-[laughing]
-[Charlotte] He always took my money.

47:01.610 --> 47:03.946
[Three] Yeah,
I've said it time and time again.

47:04.029 --> 47:06.949
Wyatt was a pushover for a pretty blonde.

47:07.032 --> 47:08.784
[laughing]

47:08.867 --> 47:10.494
[Charlotte] I think he just liked me.

47:10.577 --> 47:12.746
[Three] Well,
there was one time he got caught.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.040
-I don't know if he got tased. No.
-[man] One time?

47:15.123 --> 47:17.835
-[Three] Multiple times. Multiple times.
-[man] Yeah.

47:17.918 --> 47:20.629
[Three] Now, he said
that he didn't piss his pants,

47:20.712 --> 47:23.632
but I don't know a single person
has gotten tased and hasn't.

47:23.715 --> 47:25.592
-[laughing]
-Yeah.

47:33.350 --> 47:34.184
[Ruth] No.

47:34.268 --> 47:37.145
[clears throat] Uh, keep-- keep going.

47:37.229 --> 47:38.105
[sniffles]

47:41.692 --> 47:43.360
The first time I met Wyatt…

47:43.443 --> 47:44.778
[man] Mm-hmm.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.905
…he pushed me off a boat. [laughs]

47:46.989 --> 47:48.282
[man 2 chuckles] Wow.

47:48.365 --> 47:50.617
[man] I was driving it.
I was driving that boat.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.369
-[man 2] Classic.
-[Charlotte] I was there.

47:52.452 --> 47:54.913
[Three] But the second time,
she punched him in the face.

47:54.997 --> 47:56.540
-[man] What?
-[laughing]

47:56.623 --> 47:58.458
[chattering continues]

47:58.542 --> 48:01.503
[Three] He never told you,
but you nearly knocked him out.

48:02.546 --> 48:05.048
[Jonah] He beat up a kid at school
for bullying me.

48:06.258 --> 48:08.218
He said it was just what you did.

48:09.261 --> 48:10.220
[man] Yeah.

48:13.265 --> 48:14.850
[Three] He never did that for me.

48:14.933 --> 48:16.935
[laughing]

48:17.019 --> 48:19.396
-[Ruth sighs]
-[chattering, laughing continue]

48:33.702 --> 48:34.786
[sighs]

48:36.997 --> 48:39.791
I cannot run my operation from in here.

48:41.460 --> 48:45.339
What about a cell phone?
We could clear that with the FBI, right?

48:46.298 --> 48:48.759
Uh, I think so.

48:48.842 --> 48:50.677
Can you buy all
of the guards in here as well?

48:50.761 --> 48:52.846
Because they do a search every day.

48:52.930 --> 48:57.684
And if this doesn't work, I am not
going to hand the FBI a foolproof wiretap.

48:58.644 --> 49:01.063
Well, how about your priest?
He can visit every day.

49:01.146 --> 49:04.441
There are certain messages
he will not carry, Wendy.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.071
Well, what about getting you moved?

49:09.154 --> 49:11.823
-How-- how about a medical facility?
-[Omar] That will take too long.

49:11.907 --> 49:16.954
If this is going to work,
we must secure my power immediately.

49:18.538 --> 49:22.668
Let's-- let's, um,
let's send me to Mexico.

49:25.212 --> 49:27.464
The FBI doesn't care who's running things.

49:27.547 --> 49:30.801
As long as they feel like they've got
a controllable entity, you know,

49:30.884 --> 49:34.471
someone-- someone
to keep the money flowing. I can be that.

49:35.514 --> 49:40.227
I-I can go to Mexico,
and I can re-establish your control.

49:44.481 --> 49:47.150
You know they're not
just going to accept you, Marty.

49:47.234 --> 49:49.403
[Marty] I think they will,
with your blessing.

49:49.486 --> 49:53.031
And-- and they know that it was us
that took down Lagunas,

49:53.115 --> 49:55.450
so they know that we have power here.

49:57.369 --> 49:58.453
Let me try.

50:02.249 --> 50:03.583
This could work.

50:05.919 --> 50:08.505
[inhales] But it's not
going to be easy, Marty.

50:10.799 --> 50:14.052
Right now, I do not appear powerful
to my people.

50:15.762 --> 50:17.389
So I have to make a move.

50:21.226 --> 50:23.478
I must be the one who has killed Javi.

50:25.188 --> 50:28.692
And you,
you will deliver that message to them.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.529
Now, not everyone will take it well.

50:43.331 --> 50:45.167
Tell me everything I need to know.

50:47.210 --> 50:48.295
[knock on door]

50:57.971 --> 50:59.056
[knocks]

51:04.352 --> 51:06.021
Okay. [exhales]

51:09.775 --> 51:10.734
Hello!

51:16.740 --> 51:18.617
Is this Ruth Langmore's place?

51:26.958 --> 51:28.043
Hello!

51:30.796 --> 51:32.297
The fuck you want?

51:35.550 --> 51:38.303
[sighs] Could you come down?

51:51.900 --> 51:53.318
I need your product.

51:54.236 --> 51:57.072
We had a deal with the man you killed.

51:57.906 --> 51:59.616
I need you to make good on it.

52:04.246 --> 52:05.831
Why the fuck would I do that?

52:06.832 --> 52:10.210
Because we got security footage
of you blowing a guy's brains out.

52:18.343 --> 52:19.469
[Ruth exhales]

52:20.762 --> 52:21.638
[inhales]

52:24.224 --> 52:25.600
So fucking what?

52:53.128 --> 52:54.129
Okay.

52:55.839 --> 52:59.134
Not such a smart move,
trying to blackmail a woman

52:59.217 --> 53:01.178
you just watched kill a man.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.181
Is it?

53:05.098 --> 53:06.099
Put it away.

53:07.350 --> 53:08.602
Put it away. Do it.

53:13.398 --> 53:15.233
I didn't come here to blackmail you.

53:16.943 --> 53:17.986
This is not a threat.

53:18.570 --> 53:19.446
It's a deal.

53:21.114 --> 53:24.659
One that will be very lucrative
for the both of us.

53:31.625 --> 53:32.709
[Mel] You got a name?

53:34.002 --> 53:37.505
Kim Reddick, Marion Sheriff's Office.

53:46.348 --> 53:47.515
You like Thai food?

53:49.601 --> 53:50.602
I could eat.

53:53.813 --> 53:54.773
Clare.

53:55.607 --> 53:56.608
[Clare] Wendy.

53:57.275 --> 54:01.154
Thank you. Thank you for picking up.
Listen, I have good news.

54:01.238 --> 54:04.241
Our next shipment will be with us
very soon, so if you could just hold on--

54:04.324 --> 54:06.201
No, please, spare me. Spare me.

54:06.284 --> 54:09.913
I only picked up to say it's over.
The deal's dead.

54:09.996 --> 54:11.498
You need to stop calling.

54:13.291 --> 54:14.876
Clare… [chuckles]

54:14.960 --> 54:18.755
[hesitates] Your company
won't survive without us.

54:19.339 --> 54:22.175
You need our input a-and our goodwill.

54:22.259 --> 54:23.635
Yeah, we'll see about that.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.388
[beeps]

55:20.525 --> 55:21.651
[shudders]

55:21.735 --> 55:23.028
[clears throat, sniffles]

55:26.114 --> 55:26.948
[exhales]

56:16.915 --> 56:19.125
-Why can't we just wait?
-[Marty] Charlotte.

56:19.209 --> 56:20.919
-[sighs]
-Dad, please.

56:21.002 --> 56:22.921
They almost killed you last time.

56:23.004 --> 56:26.841
Well, it's different now.
I'm in charge. I'm gonna be okay.

56:27.550 --> 56:29.844
[Charlotte] What if
they think that you killed Javi?

56:29.928 --> 56:31.304
They won't. Thank you.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.765
-[Charlotte] You don't know that.
-Charlotte.

56:33.848 --> 56:35.016
We have to put this right.

56:35.100 --> 56:37.644
Your-- your dad's doing this
for our family.

56:37.727 --> 56:40.480
-[Marty sighs]
-He's doing this for you.

56:46.486 --> 56:47.862
[Nelson] I got that.

56:47.946 --> 56:50.073
Oh, thank you.

56:57.747 --> 57:00.625
[Nelson] Hey, do you guys mind
if I ask you a question?

57:00.708 --> 57:01.709
Okay.

57:02.377 --> 57:04.337
How'd you know he wouldn't kill you?

57:05.713 --> 57:06.714
When?

57:07.632 --> 57:10.718
I'm just saying, it was a bold move
getting him out of solitary.

57:11.553 --> 57:13.555
He did tell you he was gonna kill you.

57:17.100 --> 57:19.978
Balls like that,
you just might make it out of this thing.

57:22.772 --> 57:26.818
Um, well,
it-- it was, uh, it was Wendy's idea.

57:28.153 --> 57:30.321
She's-- she's got good instincts.
