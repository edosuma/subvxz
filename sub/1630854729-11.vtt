19:22.465 --> 19:24.293
Whoa.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.816
-It's perfect.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.818
Rand is gonna love it.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.298
I mean, he is
terrified of heights,

19:29.342 --> 19:31.039
but it's time we work
on that anyway.

19:31.082 --> 19:34.608
I'm not giving up
roller coasters for anyone.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.305
-We helped too.

19:36.349 --> 19:37.567
I did the twinkly lights.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.178
And I brought up a leaf blower

19:39.221 --> 19:43.225
and got rid of the pigeons
that are no longer with us.

19:43.269 --> 19:46.707
-Because we realized
that we make a great team.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.013
-And that's why we agreed
that we'd be...

19:49.057 --> 19:52.016
your co-maids of honor.
-Your co-maids of honor!

19:52.060 --> 19:54.236
-Oh. Oh.
I already have a maid of honor.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.325
It's my friend Nicole
from childhood.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.240
She saved me from a well once.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.677
-Yeah, go with her.
-Can't beat that.

20:03.071 --> 20:05.204
Either way, we're sorry
we couldn't get you the dress.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.770
How was I supposed to know
that stripper was

20:06.814 --> 20:08.337
just gonna take off?

20:08.381 --> 20:10.426
-Did someone say "take off"?

20:10.470 --> 20:12.559
-Hey! She's a stripper!

20:14.952 --> 20:17.172
-You were wearing that
the whole time?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.695
-I caught up
with Officer Twerkman

20:18.739 --> 20:20.175
and offered him
some free legal advice

20:20.219 --> 20:21.742
for his
"Magic Mike"-style company.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.309
He's got great drive.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.920
He's ready to rip off
those sleeves and get to work.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.403
-Whoa.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.839
Nice job, Dan.
-Ha.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.232
-How'd you put this
all together?

20:33.275 --> 20:34.798
-It wasn't that hard.

20:34.842 --> 20:38.759
I just used a lot of free stuff
from that wedding planner.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.761
-What the hell is this?

20:44.112 --> 20:45.156
-[ Chuckles ]

20:45.200 --> 20:46.767
-You planned a wedding
without me?

20:46.810 --> 20:47.942
-No, no, no. Not exactly.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.900
No, this is not a wedding.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.598
-I'm Cynthia Davies.

20:51.641 --> 20:54.122
I know a wedding when I see one.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.690
You can expect a bill
for all this.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.909
And by the way,

20:58.953 --> 21:01.956
those truffles
were made by a machine.

21:04.132 --> 21:08.528
-You're just saying that
to hurt me.

21:08.571 --> 21:11.531
-Hey, look, y'all, it's
the sad lady from the bathroom.

21:11.574 --> 21:15.274
-And it looks like she is
making up with her friends.

21:15.317 --> 21:18.015
-I'm gonna order them
some curtains.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.974
-I told you
not to look that way.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.368
