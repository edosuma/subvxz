00:32.991 --> 00:34.868
Good evening. Customer service.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.496
Yes. I had, uh,
some suggestions

00:37.496 --> 00:39.498
I'd like to talk to you about.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.751
Oh, a talker.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.879
You have reached
our Automated Suggestion Center.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.256
Please leave your message for...

00:47.256 --> 00:49.304
Phillip Martin.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.936
But then the rash went away,

00:52.928 --> 00:54.896
and I could wear pants again!

00:54.888 --> 00:58.438
Yup.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.020
Dale.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.488
Hank's going to become
a tugboat captain.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.857
Yup.

01:05.941 --> 01:09.741
Gla-gla ixnap bongo.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.162
Mm-hmm.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.412
No one listens to me.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.456
Do you guys think
horses remember things

01:16.618 --> 01:18.586
from when they were little?

01:20.706 --> 01:23.004
The picture's so blurry.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.220
Is that what's-his-name
from 90210,

01:26.211 --> 01:28.430
or what's-his-name
from Growing Up Brady?

01:28.589 --> 01:30.262
I'm fed up with this TV.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.430
We have got to get a new one.

01:32.426 --> 01:36.522
Perhaps even a flat-screen TV?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.515
Absolutely.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.391
Hank!
Dad!

01:39.391 --> 01:41.268
Okay, whatever it is,

01:41.268 --> 01:43.362
let's just slow down here.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.481
We don't need an expensive

01:46.481 --> 01:48.449
flat-screen TV, Peggy.

01:48.609 --> 01:53.365
That CSI lady looks just fine
on the TV we've already got.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.492
Well, sure, we don't need one,
Hank, but I want one,

01:56.491 --> 01:59.370
and I am prepared
to pay for it myself.

01:59.369 --> 02:03.169
You haven't sold a house
in six months, Peggy.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.468
You know, if you put it
on a credit card,

02:06.627 --> 02:08.095
I still have to pay for it?

02:08.086 --> 02:12.182
You don't think I can pay
for this TV, do you, Hank?

02:12.174 --> 02:13.517
Well, uh...

02:13.508 --> 02:14.725
no.

02:16.511 --> 02:19.856
Bobby, get ready
for the biggest, flattest TV

02:19.848 --> 02:21.691
you have ever seen in your life.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.560
Peggy, you don't
have to do this.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.313
We'll just keep the TV we have.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.441
No, let her do it, Dad.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.408
It will help her to heal.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.368
I shopped around all day,

02:35.364 --> 02:37.742
and the good flat-screens
still cost a lot more

02:37.741 --> 02:39.459
than I have in my savings.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.418
Good flat-screens?

02:40.577 --> 02:44.002
Oh, you mean, like... this?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.419
Yes, Minh, like that.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.258
I will get the money somehow.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.472
I just have to come up
with a clever invention.

02:52.631 --> 02:55.430
Something that lights up and
that kids put on their shoes.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.052
Or you could get another job.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.521
I bet there's a lot of wives
that would like you

02:59.513 --> 03:00.730
to be their husband's secretary.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.101
No need to work for TV money.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.729
Make your personal savings work
for you.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.072
Listen to my secret friend.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.487
<i>The Dow Genius.</i>

03:11.483 --> 03:14.202
So, we had a down day
in the market.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.912
Oh!

03:15.904 --> 03:17.247
Do we get scared?

03:18.448 --> 03:20.496
No! We go to Brazil

03:20.492 --> 03:23.416
where they are cornering
the bird flu vaccine market.

03:23.578 --> 03:27.799
Buy Bioteca De'Brasilia!

03:27.791 --> 03:31.512
BDSA.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.216
Well, this is amazing!

03:35.215 --> 03:37.309
I am in for a thousand.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.520
I will buy a gigundo new TV.

03:40.512 --> 03:44.267
For Hank, it will be 79 inches
of "So there!"

03:44.266 --> 03:46.519
Hey, maybe I go in
for a grand myself.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.896
I'll sell a few guns
and invest, too.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.445
Financial dignity might be
an interesting switch for me.

04:00.490 --> 04:05.371
Minh, our stock has lost 20%
in a few days!

04:05.370 --> 04:08.123
Is there any chance
we can return our stocks

04:08.123 --> 04:09.670
at the earlier price?

04:09.666 --> 04:11.509
Okay.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.503
So the market's had a downturn.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.507
The Genius feels your pain!

04:16.505 --> 04:18.507
Ow! Ow!

04:18.507 --> 04:19.760
Ow!

04:19.760 --> 04:21.103
This is crazy.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.722
Every time we obey his shouting,
I lose more money.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.520
We should just cut our losses.

04:25.515 --> 04:29.145
I'm gonna admit failure and ask
Nancy to reinstate my allowance.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.774
No, I will not be a failure
or look like one.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.400
I have got to win at this.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.988
We are overdue.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.406
Come on, you idiot.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.450
Tell us something brilliant.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.995
People, you have to remember

04:41.990 --> 04:44.493
that everybody invests
differently.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.497
When the market is slow,
buy what you know.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.965
Buy the companies that make

04:49.956 --> 04:52.505
what the average people
are buying.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.004
He has a point.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.426
We need to study America,

04:57.422 --> 05:00.392
and invest
in what America wants to buy.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.976
Okay, good.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.016
What? What do people like
to buy?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.229
I don't know.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.224
Lychee nuts? Opera CDs?

05:07.224 --> 05:09.818
Those new Russian bullets
that will go through anything!

05:09.810 --> 05:11.357
Uh, no, not you two.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.479
America.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.856
What does Joe Blow buy?

05:13.855 --> 05:15.323
Beats me.
I give up.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.693
Then we are going
on a field trip.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.036
America, roll up your sleeve.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.407
Peggy Hill is about
to take your pulse.

05:30.497 --> 05:34.001
Okay, they out of pretzels,
but not popcorn.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.503
Chocolate snack cakes
are sold out, too,

05:36.503 --> 05:38.005
but not pound cake.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.847
There has to be a pattern here.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.467
There's no pattern, Peggy!

05:41.633 --> 05:44.011
It's like Americans
are just a bunch of pigs

05:44.010 --> 05:45.387
rooting aimlessly in the dirt.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.513
Look at that!

05:46.513 --> 05:48.436
Who on earth would buy
something as repulsive

05:48.598 --> 05:50.692
as chocolate-covered
potato chips?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.524
Sorry, Minh.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.942
Oh, hi, Minh!

05:54.938 --> 05:56.485
I'm just so excited
they restocked

05:56.481 --> 05:58.358
the chocolate-covered
potato chips!

05:58.358 --> 06:00.156
These things fly off the rack.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.245
I need this and this,
and this and this...

06:02.237 --> 06:03.784
Mine!

06:03.780 --> 06:06.283
I need extra,
so I'm covered for the weekends.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.046
Minh, look
what's in Bill's cart.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.918
He got the snack cakes,

06:16.918 --> 06:19.421
the pretzels,
the aerosol cheese.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.015
What he buys,
the rest of them buy.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.475
Think about it.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.011
Bill is middle-aged, obese,

06:26.011 --> 06:29.106
with disposable income,
and poor impulse control.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.099
He is the average
American consumer.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.522
Bill is our golden pig!

06:33.518 --> 06:34.895
Ho, yeah!

06:46.031 --> 06:48.750
Hmm. Oh! I need
jumbo wrap!

06:48.742 --> 06:50.836
Mega-Lo-Wrap. Check.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.455
What on earth he wrapping
with that much wrap?

06:53.455 --> 06:55.708
The American consumer
doesn't know.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.210
All it knows is it must wrap.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.797
You know, I know it's just Bill,

07:01.796 --> 07:04.265
but something doesn't feel right
about this.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.055
Do-Do you think
we should tell him?

07:06.051 --> 07:07.473
We can't tell him.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.721
People act most natural

07:08.720 --> 07:10.438
when they don't know
they're being observed.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.100
I cite as evidence
several hundred episodes

07:13.099 --> 07:15.022
of Candid Camera.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.649
Hmm.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.614
Let's... see.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.079
I like shopping with all of you.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.449
Usually, the only people
who talk to me in stores

07:28.448 --> 07:30.871
are older gay men
who've dropped their standards.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.245
Well, buy something already!

07:33.244 --> 07:34.496
Okay!

07:34.496 --> 07:36.965
Ooh!

07:38.500 --> 07:39.672
I read about this.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.011
A mini jungle gym

07:41.002 --> 07:42.720
for your cats to play in.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.430
You don't have any cats.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.221
Well, I might... some day.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.231
Ooh!

07:54.224 --> 07:56.022
<i>Castle Wolfehammer 9!</i>

07:56.017 --> 07:58.486
"Sergeant Vengeance battles
the Furious Fuhrer!"

07:59.813 --> 08:02.157
Hey, C-Hammer Nine!

08:02.148 --> 08:03.650
Right On!

08:04.734 --> 08:05.906
So, Bill,

08:05.902 --> 08:08.746
where ya feel like
going for lunch, huh?

08:15.578 --> 08:19.503
So. Heh. "That's
a Real Italiano!"

08:19.499 --> 08:20.500
Heh-heh.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.502
Home of the Spaghetti Sandwich.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.255
I recommend the Jumbo
Spaghetti Sandwich.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.472
It's my favorite.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.857
Well, it certainly
is... popular.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.773
And publicly traded.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.442
Ho, yeah.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.452
All right!

08:52.449 --> 08:54.497
This one here is
top-of-the-line.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.711
If it's the top of the line,
I'll take it.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.502
Uh, care to add
a "Super-Surround" system,

08:59.497 --> 09:01.499
with ultra stereo boost?

09:01.499 --> 09:02.876
Throw it in.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.179
Well, here we go.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.977
Everyone ready?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.474
It's third and eleven

09:17.474 --> 09:18.817
the Cowboys have got to pass...

09:18.808 --> 09:21.527
Oh, my gosh, Hank, turn it down.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.066
Turn it down, Hank!

09:23.063 --> 09:25.657
I can't tell... which button.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.525
Dad! Make it stop!

09:28.485 --> 09:30.328
Oh, goodness.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.742
Well, it's got
a little something

09:31.738 --> 09:33.160
under the hood there,
doesn't it?

09:33.156 --> 09:34.908
I'm proud of you, Peggy.

09:36.326 --> 09:41.833
I cannot believe this amazing TV
is really in our house!

09:41.831 --> 09:43.925
Yeah, Peggy, how did
you afford this?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.136
I mean, it had to be
pretty expensive.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.506
Hugely expensive, but that
does not matter anymore.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.305
I am so excited
I can finally tell you.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.429
I have discovered
a secret gold mine.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.524
Uh, I don't like the way
you just said "gold mine."

09:59.516 --> 10:01.518
What do you mean?

10:01.518 --> 10:04.067
...so we made all
this crazy money,

10:04.062 --> 10:06.156
just by studying Bill.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.193
You don't look proud
of me anymore.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.911
Well, I wonder why not.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.701
Peggy, you used Bill.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.243
You have to fix this.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.868
I hope you're not gonna say
we should get rid of the TV.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.915
Well, of course not...
It's incredible...

10:19.911 --> 10:22.505
But you have to tell Bill
what you've been doing.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.044
Promise me you'll do that.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.010
Then let's go back to watching
this amazing thing.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.723
So... you were...
studying me?

10:38.179 --> 10:39.897
You listened to me!

10:39.889 --> 10:41.436
My opinions made a difference!

10:41.599 --> 10:43.852
So you're not mad?

10:43.852 --> 10:47.231
No. I'm honored that
you cared what I thought.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.824
You folks feelin' like dessert?

10:49.816 --> 10:52.160
Yeah. Bill, dessert!

10:52.152 --> 10:53.449
What do you, want
to have? Huh?

10:58.199 --> 10:59.667
Hmm...

10:59.659 --> 11:01.002
Good point.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.464
What does Bill want for dessert?

11:06.624 --> 11:10.345
And it displays
windows within windows.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.886
I still haven't figured out how
to make those go away, though.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.510
It's so nice when people care
what you have to say.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.103
Hank, why didn't you ever
tell me what it was like?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.473
Well, I'm just happy
you're okay with it.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.099
I thought it might
make you angry.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.727
Of course you thought
Bill would think that.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.650
But only Bill knows
what Bill thinks.

11:27.645 --> 11:31.650
You have this nice TV because
I have the power of being me.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.492
Bill, you don't have powers.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.862
It works because you're so...
typical.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.330
Still...

11:37.322 --> 11:39.165
you're not the one
who's typical, I am.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.125
I buy things,
and it makes money,

11:41.117 --> 11:42.494
so we can buy more things.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.665
I'm like an ecosystem.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.083
Dad, look!

11:45.079 --> 11:49.004
Two Rob Schneider movies
on-screen at the same time.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.877
You're welcome, Bobby.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.506
So, how are our
profits this week?

11:54.505 --> 11:55.677
Minimal.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.516
We need to diversify.

11:57.508 --> 12:01.229
All our positions are still
in junk food and cat toys.

12:01.221 --> 12:05.351
"Hedge funds...
global indicators..."

12:05.350 --> 12:07.978
Hey, this "tech sector" stuff
must be important.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.775
The article on it
is really long.

12:09.771 --> 12:10.897
Check this out:

12:10.897 --> 12:12.490
there's a big computer
trade show

12:12.482 --> 12:13.779
in Austin next week.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.402
Okay, computers.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.411
What will Bill pick for us?
Robots?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.449
I hope he chooses some robots.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.547
Wow... it's so incredible.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.336
So this is the future, huh?

12:40.426 --> 12:41.473
I don't know.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.354
Everybody's so cool.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.519
It's not about being cool, Bill.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.142
Most people aren't cool.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.691
This is about what regular
Americans are going to buy.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.816
Now... digital cameras.
What do you like?

12:53.815 --> 12:55.488
Well, I just...

12:55.483 --> 12:57.736
I don't know...

12:57.735 --> 12:59.032
I mean, I, I think...

12:59.028 --> 13:01.030
Don't think about it.
Just be Bill.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.495
Come on, Bill.
Just pick something.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.462
I don't know. I don't know.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.421
I... I... I...

13:12.583 --> 13:14.506
Damn it. We broke him.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.095
He's useless now.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.509
This is classic Heisenberg.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.722
The observer effect.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.887
Observer? Wha...?

13:19.882 --> 13:22.135
The very act of observation

13:22.135 --> 13:24.012
interferes with the outcome,

13:24.012 --> 13:26.390
often misattributed
to Heisenberg,

13:26.389 --> 13:29.518
who was wrong about the bomb,
but right about uncertainty.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.020
See, now you're watching you.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.397
And that's the problem.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.364
It shows up in Al theory, too.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.949
Quite so.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.488
Anyway, this thing is a wash.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.827
You're broken.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.492
Game over.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.239
Oh, dang it.
I was gonna get Hank

13:43.239 --> 13:44.912
a La-Z-Boy with
a fridge in it.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.250
They have those.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.711
Eh, it was pretty good
while it lasted.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.753
No! It's not over!

13:52.749 --> 13:53.921
I can still do it!

13:53.916 --> 13:55.918
America will love, uh...

13:55.918 --> 13:57.511
this!

13:57.503 --> 13:59.505
No, wait. Come back!

13:59.505 --> 14:01.257
Come ba... I'm still Bill.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.509
I can pick winners.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.806
Nobody can be Bill like me.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.429
I'll show them.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.098
I have to show them.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.486
This is 24-7 Stockz.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.904
So, what are we trading?

14:18.900 --> 14:20.902
Hi. If, if I use
my savings

14:20.902 --> 14:22.870
and take out a second mortgage
on my house,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.489
can I open a trading account?

14:24.489 --> 14:25.911
You betcha.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.831
Good because I want
to buy, buy, buy.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.508
Well, what do we do next?

14:35.500 --> 14:38.800
Now that Bill's melted down,
he won't be any help anymore.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.514
How about we try
the Dow Genius again?

14:41.506 --> 14:43.508
Let me put it this way,

14:43.508 --> 14:47.229
ZNE Technologies
is like a Mafia wife...

14:47.220 --> 14:49.018
Do not touch!

14:49.013 --> 14:51.516
Okay, next caller
is Bill from Texas.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.234
Howdy, cowboy.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.025
I've gone broke.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.490
Well, maybe it's not our Bill.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.859
Okay, Bill from Arlen, Texas
is broke.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.485
Happens to the best of us,
big man.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.828
So, what do you got for me?

15:03.820 --> 15:04.821
Uh-oh.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.119
Please, please help me.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.834
I've mortgaged my house;
I used all my savings

15:09.826 --> 15:11.499
to invest in a sure thing,
but then...

15:11.494 --> 15:13.337
Whoa, slim, you telling me

15:13.329 --> 15:15.502
you bet your whole nut
on one stock?

15:15.498 --> 15:17.500
Give me the nutcracker.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.752
Let's see it.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.222
Don't laugh at me.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.887
I was once
a stock-picking genius,

15:24.882 --> 15:27.806
but I made so much money
for my friends...

15:32.181 --> 15:39.030
We're still not 100% certain
that was our Bill.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.484
Minh? Are you home?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.986
Peggy? Anyone?

15:46.487 --> 15:49.661
Maybe we should just go out
there and, and talk to him.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.500
And say what?

15:51.492 --> 15:54.496
Sorry, your life is somehow
even worse than it was?

15:54.495 --> 15:57.294
Yeah, and besides we didn't
do anything wrong.

15:57.290 --> 16:01.511
Oh, come on, we used him for our
own gain until we broke him,

16:01.502 --> 16:02.879
and then we cast him aside?

16:02.879 --> 16:05.507
Then, in a desperate attempt
to regain our love,

16:05.506 --> 16:07.383
he lost everything he owned.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.306
But other than that,
we're good, right?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.482
What are these words?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.325
Can't we get rid of those guys?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.443
Who are they?

16:25.443 --> 16:27.320
No idea. Dang it.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.664
There are so many buttons
on this remote.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.461
Ew!
Ew!

16:37.872 --> 16:42.002
Oh, it hurts my eyes!
It's too detailed!

16:42.001 --> 16:44.845
This is what madness
must feel like!

16:46.839 --> 16:48.512
Oh, thank goodness.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.431
Somehow it went to sleep.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.689
Now what?
What's that voice?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.182
It's just Bill.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.480
He doesn't sound too good.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.029
My strategy was sound.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.492
I leveraged liquidity,

17:06.483 --> 17:08.737
but there were negative
market corrections.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.738
Overall I give myself
an "A" for theory.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.457
Bill, you don't know
what any of those words mean.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.915
I just wanted people
to listen to me, Hank.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.503
It's so awful being ignored.

17:18.496 --> 17:21.089
You know what's gonna
be even more awful?

17:21.082 --> 17:22.299
You're gonna lose your house.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.009
How much are you
on the hook for?

17:24.001 --> 17:25.799
A lot.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.844
And not my usual "a lot."
This time I'm being accurate.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.432
Dang it.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.514
All right, I'm gonna
go find the others.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.187
It was on "Sleep."

17:39.183 --> 17:41.402
And then it stopped sleeping.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.488
Don't leave us alone with it.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.732
Unplug it to be sure.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.449
Who knows what it'll do next?

17:57.743 --> 18:01.839
Oh, thank God!
I thought you were Bill!

18:01.831 --> 18:03.504
How could you three do this?

18:03.499 --> 18:05.376
You know the way Bill is,

18:05.376 --> 18:07.470
but you took him out
for a spin anyway.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.462
It's like you had a truck

18:08.629 --> 18:11.428
with faulty brakes,
but you just didn't care.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.676
We feel terrible.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.177
I want to help,

18:14.176 --> 18:16.895
but the Gribbles have a long
history of making things worse.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.230
Well...

18:18.222 --> 18:20.350
I guess we could sell off
our holdings

18:20.349 --> 18:22.272
to pay off Bill's
mortgage ourselves.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.485
Hank, I know how much
you love it,

18:27.481 --> 18:29.279
but the TV came
from using Bill and...

18:29.275 --> 18:30.322
Sell it.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.286
Yes, anything to, uh...

18:32.278 --> 18:33.495
help our friend.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.660
You are an inspiration, Hank.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.496
$5,000?

19:15.488 --> 19:17.206
That's nowhere near enough.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.041
The man mortgaged his house.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.211
How about this:

19:22.203 --> 19:24.046
instead of selling
off more guns,

19:24.038 --> 19:26.507
I could just leave a few out
on Bill's doorstep,

19:26.499 --> 19:28.501
and let come what may.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.509
Let's just give him this much.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.475
It's better than nothing,
and at least we tried.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.232
Thank you all.
It's awfully generous.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.646
But I won't need this money now.

19:44.642 --> 19:45.939
It turns out after all that...

19:45.935 --> 19:47.903
You know where
a working man

19:47.895 --> 19:49.772
can get a cold beer around here?

19:49.772 --> 19:50.898
In the kitchen.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.737
Even total strangers don't care
if they interrupt me.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.488
Sorry, Bill. Looks like
he's here helping Buck

19:57.488 --> 19:58.990
move the TV today.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.206
Go on.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.792
What's the use?

20:01.784 --> 20:04.833
Anyway, thanks for the money,
but I'm safe now.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.456
I declared bankruptcy
this morning.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.499
You declared bankruptcy?

20:08.499 --> 20:10.001
Well, it's Texas, Hank.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.173
They're pretty efficient
about this sort of thing.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.048
They even had a special
E-Z-Broke phone line.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.800
Anyway, I won't take up
any more of your time...

20:17.800 --> 20:19.973
Whoa, hold on, friend,
not so fast.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.437
Did you just say you got

20:21.429 --> 20:23.773
a bona fide,
state-certified bankruptcy?

20:23.764 --> 20:26.108
Yeah.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.148
Ooh, how does that work?

20:28.144 --> 20:30.192
Do you have to declare
all of your assets

20:30.187 --> 20:31.860
or can you keep
your offshore money?

20:31.856 --> 20:33.733
And who were you hiding
your money from?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.485
Your wife? The government?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.236
I want to go bankrupt some day.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.204
I just want to owe
a little more first.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.493
Is it hard to pull off?

20:40.489 --> 20:43.163
Oh, no, it was so easy,
even I could do it.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.958
Well, don't just repeat
that part, my man.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.376
Give us the whole gory details.

20:48.372 --> 20:52.252
Wow, I can't believe you want
to hear what I have to say.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.132
Well, Buck, if you'll

20:57.131 --> 20:59.805
hand me that beer, I'll
tell you all about it.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.972
Fantastic.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.515
Darrin, this could take a while.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.388
Man, I'm all over this.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.517
Apparently, there are
a lot of bankruptcies.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.110
The E-Z-Broke guy
was very helpful...

21:10.102 --> 21:11.945
Let me tell you,
it's pretty scary

21:11.937 --> 21:13.439
seeing all those zeroes
at first, but...

21:54.647 --> 21:56.775
<i>Hank's going to become
a tugboat captain.</i>
