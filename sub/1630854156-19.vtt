00:20.337 --> 00:21.687
LOUISE: Okay, this ketchup
is full and...

00:21.914 --> 00:24.765
Oh, no, Gene, watch out,
he's attacking your ketchup!

00:24.917 --> 00:26.191
Oh, my gosh,
it's a ketchup battle!

00:26.343 --> 00:28.085
Did we even know these two
were archenemies?

00:28.103 --> 00:29.695
Aah! My ketchup is a pacifist!

00:29.846 --> 00:31.255
Louise, please don't fight
with the ketchup.

00:31.348 --> 00:32.680
Or it becomes
our restaurant's new thing

00:32.700 --> 00:33.866
and we finally get rich?

00:34.017 --> 00:35.092
-No.
-Yes.

00:35.110 --> 00:36.184
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Teddy.
-Teddy!

00:36.353 --> 00:37.870
-Hi.
-Hello to you.

00:38.097 --> 00:39.354
(exhales) Hey, Teddy.

00:39.448 --> 00:41.765
Wow. Thirsty, Linda?
Also, water? Ew.

00:41.784 --> 00:43.191
Oh, boy, here it comes.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.193
It's part of this whole thing
Ginger told me about.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.271
She read an article
that said it takes 21 days

00:47.289 --> 00:48.530
to form a new habit.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.608
So, my new healthy habit
is drinking more water.

00:51.627 --> 00:54.053
That's great, Linda.
Not worth it, but good for you.

00:54.204 --> 00:55.554
Yeah. I just
have to train myself

00:55.723 --> 00:58.448
to drink ten glasses of water
a day for the rest of my life.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.208
Ten is a lot.
I-I think I drink one?

01:00.227 --> 01:02.561
-A-And it's coffee.
-So, what are we having, Teddy?

01:02.712 --> 01:04.379
I actually need to get
my food to go today.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.047
Oh, why aren't you eating here?

01:06.067 --> 01:07.307
-Too much water talk.
-Sort of, but also,

01:07.476 --> 01:08.716
I got to head out
to the rec center

01:08.811 --> 01:10.294
to work on a wrestling ring.

01:10.312 --> 01:11.403
Wait, wait. A wrestling ring?

01:11.630 --> 01:13.072
-For what?
-And don't say wrestling.

01:13.223 --> 01:15.557
It's for the Crustacean Nation
Wrestling Federation.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.651
They're a group of local
performance artists who dress up

01:17.803 --> 01:20.412
like crabs and lobsters
and stuff, and then they fight.

01:20.639 --> 01:22.973
What? This is happening
in our town?

01:23.066 --> 01:24.324
Our dumb town is cool?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.585
Yeah, I think it started
at Lobsterfest one year

01:26.736 --> 01:27.978
and it just kept going.

01:27.996 --> 01:29.737
Why wouldn't it?
Teddy, do you get to see

01:29.832 --> 01:32.407
any giant, fighting crabs
when you're working on the ring?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.742
Oh, yeah. You know they're
people in costumes, right?

01:34.762 --> 01:35.819
I-I said that, right?

01:35.988 --> 01:37.245
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take me with you.

01:37.323 --> 01:38.746
I want to see
giant crab people fight.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.082
I mean, I also want to see them
start a calypso band,

01:41.102 --> 01:42.101
but I'll take what I can get.

01:42.328 --> 01:43.493
I'm a fan
of the wrestling butts.

01:43.587 --> 01:45.495
-I mean, arts.
-What do you think, Bob?

01:45.664 --> 01:47.664
It might be
a cultural experience?

01:47.757 --> 01:50.167
Come on, Dad.
Listen to your hydrated wife.

01:50.185 --> 01:52.002
-Okay, fine, go.
-Yes!

01:52.004 --> 01:54.113
But don't do stuff
that's not good.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.673
-Well put.
-Uh, okay. Taking kids to a job.

01:56.692 --> 01:59.601
That's a responsible
and probably fine thing to do.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.194
And while you kids are out,
your mom's gonna drink

02:01.288 --> 02:02.512
six more glasses of water.

02:02.531 --> 02:04.606
So we're both gonna have
a cool day.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.183
<i> TEDDY:</i>
<i> Okay, now,</i>

02:06.201 --> 02:07.442
don't step on anything sharp

02:07.536 --> 02:08.794
and don't stand near
anything heavy

02:08.963 --> 02:10.778
and if anyone says, "Hey,
you're not supposed to be here,"

02:10.798 --> 02:12.689
-just run.
-LOUISE: Rules to live by.

02:12.708 --> 02:13.966
And maybe keep kind of quiet.

02:14.117 --> 02:17.361
-Holy crap!
-I think you mean, "holy crab"?

02:17.379 --> 02:18.470
Okay, I'm gonna get
working on the ring

02:18.622 --> 02:20.305
and also pretend
I don't know you guys.

02:20.532 --> 02:22.975
Hello, I'm Gene.
I'm allergic to you.

02:23.126 --> 02:24.643
ISOPOD:
So we're thinking
grand slam, riptide,

02:24.870 --> 02:28.296
crabby-jabby-power-up, and then
claw-drop and we're out.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.982
Such a beautiful language.

02:30.209 --> 02:32.709
Hmm. It still feels like
it's missing something.

02:32.728 --> 02:34.060
Maybe a few pinch-clinchers?

02:34.155 --> 02:35.837
You're gonna bring down
the house with a pinch-clincher?

02:35.839 --> 02:37.047
Um, what if you guys did, like,

02:37.065 --> 02:39.049
a body-switch
decapitation-type move?

02:39.067 --> 02:40.550
-SPIDER CRAB: What's that?
-ISOPOD: What?

02:40.644 --> 02:41.568
Like, say,
you bite off his head,

02:41.662 --> 02:42.736
and he bites off your head,

02:42.888 --> 02:44.070
then you guys switch heads

02:44.165 --> 02:45.664
and then start doing
each other's moves.

02:45.815 --> 02:47.815
Or forget it. Never mind.
Tina, stop talking.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.150
-What?
-CAROL: Uh, who are you?

02:49.170 --> 02:50.243
-Um...
-Uh...

02:50.396 --> 02:51.728
-Run!
-TEDDY: Sorry, Carol.

02:51.821 --> 02:53.747
Sorry.
Kids, uh, this is Carol.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.915
She's the, uh...

02:55.009 --> 02:56.842
Creative director
and show announcer

02:56.993 --> 02:58.177
for Crustacean Nation.

02:58.328 --> 03:00.295
Teddy, I didn't know
you were a dad.

03:00.406 --> 03:01.571
He's not our dad.
He just took us here

03:01.665 --> 03:03.498
-from our home.
-Okay.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.367
-But he's friends with our dad.
-Best friends.

03:05.427 --> 03:06.927
A lot of people say
best friends.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.578
The kids wanted
to come see the wrestlers,

03:08.672 --> 03:10.747
but I can make them wait
in the back of my truck.

03:10.766 --> 03:11.690
That's safe, right?

03:11.917 --> 03:13.358
Well, hold on.
I sort of want to hear

03:13.585 --> 03:14.918
the rest of this
bunny kid's idea.

03:14.937 --> 03:16.862
You're saying
actually switch heads?

03:17.013 --> 03:19.606
Um, yeah.
Switch heads and switch moves.

03:19.758 --> 03:21.091
Hmm. Could try it.

03:21.109 --> 03:22.517
Those heads come off
pretty easy, right?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.094
-ISOPOD: Uh-huh.
-Go rip each other's heads off.

03:24.187 --> 03:26.096
-BOTH: Okay.
-All right, I'm gonna step back

03:26.114 --> 03:29.616
over here and keep doing
a really good job. Goodbye.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.693
-(thuds)
-Thanks, kid.
Oh, boy, the Nautilus

03:31.787 --> 03:33.712
just got stuck
in the door again.

03:33.863 --> 03:35.047
Hold on, Devon.
Don't move.

03:35.274 --> 03:36.440
You're gonna tear
your umbilicus.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.366
-Excuse me, folks.
-Wait, uh, Carol.

03:38.460 --> 03:42.054
What if someone like us--
someone just like us--

03:42.205 --> 03:44.798
wanted to be in the show,
to wrestle?

03:44.950 --> 03:46.708
Oh, I don't know.
Actually wrestling?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.043
I mean, for starters,
you're a kid, no offense.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.713
And you, or this someone,
would need a costume.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.140
That's kind of a big part
of our deal here.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.902
Oh, wow, come to think of it,
we have costumes.

03:57.129 --> 03:58.628
Sea cucumber costumes.

03:58.647 --> 04:00.739
We do? Oh, you mean
our pickle costumes?

04:00.890 --> 04:02.908
No, our sea cucumber costumes.

04:03.059 --> 04:05.059
Remember our really great
sea cucumber costumes?

04:05.228 --> 04:07.228
She says pickle
when she means sea cucumber.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.473
And we could write a story line
that you're just gonna love.

04:09.475 --> 04:11.566
Especially if you love
calypso music.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.994
Huh. I mean, your head-switch
idea was pretty good.

04:14.146 --> 04:16.813
Tell you what, next practice
is Tuesday at 4:00.

04:16.906 --> 04:18.257
Come with your costumes
and ideas.

04:18.408 --> 04:20.425
If I like it,
maybe I'll give you a shot

04:20.577 --> 04:21.593
at our show on Saturday.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.653
-Yes.
-DEVON: Uh, a little help?

04:23.672 --> 04:25.413
-Uh, a little...
-CAROL: Sorry, Devon.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.325
Ugh, he needs to come
out of his shell. Literally.

04:28.343 --> 04:30.251
-Wait, what are we doing?
-Tina, Gene,

04:30.271 --> 04:31.753
would you make me
the happiest girl in the world

04:31.847 --> 04:34.439
by dressing up as sea cucumbers
and wrestling with me?

04:34.549 --> 04:36.683
Wear a costume and be loud
and have people look at me?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.610
-I'm in, sister.
-I mean, I guess so.

04:38.762 --> 04:40.261
I do like sea cucumbers.

04:40.281 --> 04:43.431
It'd be an honor to tell their
story. Through, uh, wrestling.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.617
-Yes! Wresting!
-Wrestling!

04:45.694 --> 04:47.193
Wrestling! But also,

04:47.288 --> 04:50.030
we should probably ask
Mom and Dad if it's okay first?

04:50.182 --> 04:51.773
-Oh, yeah. We'll ask, we'll ask.
-Wrestling!

04:51.867 --> 04:53.441
-Wrestling!
-Wrestling!

04:53.535 --> 04:56.703
-(kids continue shouting)
-Who brought those
noisy kids, huh?

04:56.855 --> 04:58.380
Geez. Mm.

05:02.528 --> 05:03.802
O-Okay, just to make sure,
you kids are only

05:03.953 --> 05:05.137
wrestling each other, right?

05:05.288 --> 05:06.546
We're not being
bad parents, are we?

05:06.698 --> 05:08.365
By letting you take part
in an underground

05:08.534 --> 05:10.534
crustacean-themed
wrestling show?

05:10.702 --> 05:11.977
I don't know, Dad.

05:12.128 --> 05:13.370
We'll wrestle whoever
we need to wrestle.

05:13.463 --> 05:14.554
We don't want to be
the newbies who are like,

05:14.648 --> 05:15.889
"Oh, I'm only wrestling kids

05:16.041 --> 05:17.541
because I'm a kid
and I could get hurt."

05:17.634 --> 05:19.967
But that's exactly
what I want you to say.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.636
Okay, let's talk about
our characters.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.879
Gene, you're gonna be the diva.

05:22.898 --> 05:24.489
-That sounds right.
-And you're purple

05:24.641 --> 05:26.474
because it totally makes
sense for your character

05:26.568 --> 05:28.552
and also because
that was the only color

05:28.570 --> 05:30.570
Mom had left back when
she made that costume.

05:30.722 --> 05:32.389
I'm violent and I'm violet.

05:32.482 --> 05:34.074
Tina, you're
the mysterious badass.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.316
That checks out.

05:35.394 --> 05:37.243
And I'll be the wild card.

05:37.396 --> 05:38.986
Also, Mom, I've done
some sketches here,

05:39.081 --> 05:41.414
how to make these pickles
more sea cucumbery.

05:41.583 --> 05:43.416
Then there's this giant
cardboard stroller.

05:43.585 --> 05:45.344
-'Cause we're also babies.
-Why are we babies?

05:45.571 --> 05:47.070
'Cause we're small.
And we're radioactive.

05:47.072 --> 05:49.573
-Why are we radioactive?
-Tina, it all makes sense.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.575
Mom, work your magic.
I know you can do it.

05:51.668 --> 05:54.077
Uh, okay. Hold on,
I got to pee. (grunts)

05:54.096 --> 05:56.855
-Again?
-Yes. Ten glasses
of water a day.

05:57.006 --> 05:59.507
Which turns out that means
I'm never not in the bathroom.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.935
Louise, did you say
"giant cardboard stroller"?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.754
Yes, I did.
But with no pee on it, please.

06:04.756 --> 06:06.681
<i> And then Tina swings Gene</i>

06:06.700 --> 06:08.015
into me,
trying to knock me down.

06:08.110 --> 06:10.927
But I drop to the ground
and steamroll towards her,

06:11.096 --> 06:13.020
with sparklers.
That's the radiation.

06:13.115 --> 06:15.782
And then we all fall
into a big pile and explode.

06:15.951 --> 06:17.358
We'll get Teddy on pyro
for that.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.693
We also do an interpretive dance
at the end

06:18.712 --> 06:20.995
-for a solid ten minutes.
-Not sure about that.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.606
Oh, and picture
our costumes different.

06:22.699 --> 06:23.957
Our Mom's not done yet.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.701
Uh-huh. Okay, first,
we really need to simplify.

06:26.795 --> 06:28.461
And no fire or explosives.

06:28.614 --> 06:30.630
-I feel I shouldn't
have to say that.
-Then don't.

06:30.782 --> 06:33.892
Carol, my roommate accidentally
ran over my tail with her Vespa.

06:34.119 --> 06:35.394
-Again?
-Yeah.

06:35.545 --> 06:36.711
Roommates, huh?

06:36.730 --> 06:40.381
Aw, look at you.
And look at me at how good I did

06:40.401 --> 06:42.567
-on these costumes, huh?
-Sorry we both can't go.

06:42.719 --> 06:45.145
It's okay. You won the bun toss
fair and square.

06:45.297 --> 06:46.479
Always bet on bottom.

06:46.632 --> 06:48.407
Aw, my little capricious
sea cucumbers.

06:48.558 --> 06:51.392
-Okay.
-And I hope there's no
capricious activity

06:51.470 --> 06:52.636
at the wrestling match.

06:52.729 --> 06:55.247
Ugh, the "new vocabulary word
every day" habit

06:55.398 --> 06:57.231
is so much better
than the drinking water habit.

06:57.309 --> 07:00.310
But Lin, isn't the whole point
of the 21-day habit thing

07:00.328 --> 07:02.587
to stick with it for 21 days?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.664
Oh, Bob.
Stop being capricious.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.040
What does capricious mean?

07:06.151 --> 07:07.759
It's complicated.
It's-it's hard to explain.

07:07.836 --> 07:10.336
I believe it comes from
the root word "capri pants."

07:10.505 --> 07:12.431
Loving the chitchat,
but we got to go get crusty

07:12.658 --> 07:15.341
-with some 'staceans, so...
-Okay. Have fun.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.269
Don't break a chair
on each other's faces.

07:17.496 --> 07:19.496
Or staple each other.
Capricious.

07:19.514 --> 07:21.273
<i> -(Isopod roaring)</i>
<i> -CAROL: Oh! After</i>

07:21.424 --> 07:23.500
a jaw-dropping
decapitation-head-switch,

07:23.518 --> 07:25.610
Captain Isopod
has kicked the krill

07:25.762 --> 07:29.281
out of Lord Spider Crab using
the crab's own signature move.

07:29.432 --> 07:31.357
That was my idea.
I made that happen.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.118
(whoops) We're up next.
We feeling good?

07:33.269 --> 07:34.511
We feeling salty?

07:34.604 --> 07:36.179
W-Wait, do I start with a grab
and then swing

07:36.198 --> 07:38.198
-or-or swing and then grab?
-Grab and then swing.

07:38.274 --> 07:40.459
Come on,
we got to get into position.

07:40.686 --> 07:42.109
(rock music playing)

07:42.129 --> 07:44.521
Okay, inverti-fans,
we've got some special guests

07:44.690 --> 07:46.798
making their debut
in the ring today.

07:46.950 --> 07:49.134
So, put your claws
together for...

07:49.361 --> 07:53.697
the Barbaric Radioactive
Baby Sea Cucumbers!

07:53.715 --> 07:55.715
(whoops)
Yeah!

07:56.551 --> 08:00.053
Uh-oh. Seems like we've
woken up these baby sea cukes

08:00.205 --> 08:02.814
from their nap,
and they do not look happy.

08:02.966 --> 08:04.390
Now they're fighting
over a rattle.

08:04.543 --> 08:05.650
Glad I'm up here.

08:05.802 --> 08:07.969
-Bust out.
-(all groaning)

08:07.988 --> 08:09.546
-(grunts)
-Ow!

08:09.564 --> 08:11.381
-Whoa!
-(grunts)

08:11.399 --> 08:13.550
-(grunts)
-TINA: Sorry, sorry.

08:13.643 --> 08:15.494
Oh, so vicious, sort of.

08:15.687 --> 08:18.054
-Aah! My shades.
-LOUISE: Leave the shades.

08:18.073 --> 08:21.416
Hit the ropes.
Cucumber Crush. Go, go.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.652
-(exclaims)
-Ah... Oh, crap.

08:24.746 --> 08:25.912
Dang it. That was bad.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.230
-Boo!
-Sloppy!

08:27.323 --> 08:29.733
-Ow!
-(grunting)
-BOB: Oh, boy.

08:29.826 --> 08:30.825
Don't worry, I got this.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.736
-Gene, no.
-Now I'm seeing

08:32.754 --> 08:36.515
what I believe is some sort
of terrifying dancing?

08:36.742 --> 08:38.165
(whispers):
Cucumber pile. Cucumber pile.

08:38.334 --> 08:40.018
TINA:
Wait, do I go over...
Which side do I...

08:40.229 --> 08:42.003
Aah!
I'm stuck!

08:42.022 --> 08:43.246
Ay, ay, ay, ay.

08:43.339 --> 08:44.914
-Wait, wait, no, no, no!
-(shouts)

08:44.933 --> 08:46.916
(kids screaming)

08:46.935 --> 08:49.435
I told you kids
to keep it simple.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.196
You're lucky that
none of you got hurt.

08:51.423 --> 08:54.348
Yes, I'm happy about that.
That would not have been good.

08:54.426 --> 08:56.760
For me, as the person
who let you do this.

08:56.778 --> 08:58.036
Look, maybe there's a reason

08:58.187 --> 09:00.446
they don't usually use kids
in combat sports.

09:00.599 --> 09:02.265
Ring held up pretty good.
Just saying.

09:02.358 --> 09:03.691
So, great work, Teddy.

09:03.860 --> 09:05.285
Yep, okay.
Uh, nice meeting you.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.545
-Sorry, Louise.
-Wait.

09:06.772 --> 09:09.214
I just, uh...
That was not our best stuff.

09:09.365 --> 09:11.883
I mean, we have a whole
other chapter in our story

09:12.110 --> 09:13.200
that we didn't get to yet

09:13.220 --> 09:15.202
-that's way better.
-Is that so?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.371
Yes. Their battle
with the, um...

09:17.391 --> 09:19.299
-Sea Sponge.
-The Sea Sponge?

09:19.451 --> 09:21.634
Yeah, the Sea Sponge.
Who is, uh, this guy.

09:21.711 --> 09:24.229
-This guy, like, this guy?
-It's funny when he pretends

09:24.380 --> 09:26.213
we haven't already
discussed this.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.974
So, please give us
another chance?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.401
I know we can be great.

09:29.552 --> 09:31.903
(sighs) Okay.
I'll give you one more chance.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.238
There's something there.

09:33.465 --> 09:35.315
It's really, really bad
right now.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.410
But maybe it could be
not really, really bad.

09:38.561 --> 09:40.303
-Good feedback, good feedback.
-Yes! Thank you.

09:40.322 --> 09:43.807
Can we get these things off now?
My pickle is starting to tickle.

09:43.825 --> 09:47.660
-Lin? W-What are you doing?
-I'm fixing my posture.

09:47.813 --> 09:50.922
The vocabulary thing was, uh,
you know, what's the word?

09:51.074 --> 09:52.591
Vocabulary-tastic?

09:52.742 --> 09:53.925
Dumb.
This is a better one.

09:54.111 --> 09:56.169
In 21 days, my whole body'll
be reorganized.

09:56.338 --> 09:58.096
And also, Bob,
while I'm doing this,

09:58.247 --> 09:59.339
will you hold my chin in
like this?

09:59.433 --> 10:00.932
-(grunts)
-All right, but I don't know

10:01.084 --> 10:03.827
-if I can do it for 21 days.
-Oh, you're so busy?

10:03.845 --> 10:07.180
Anyway, I'm thinking Teddy
the Sea Sponge is our nemesis

10:07.274 --> 10:09.349
because he absorbed
our parents to death.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.258
Mom, how many sponges
do we have?

10:11.353 --> 10:13.002
'Cause we're gonna need
all of them plus 300.

10:13.096 --> 10:16.005
Tina, Gene, you need
to cancel all your plans.

10:16.099 --> 10:18.116
We have to be
completely devoted to this.

10:18.267 --> 10:20.026
-BOTH: Uh...
-You're right,
that's not enough.

10:20.178 --> 10:23.121
Freakishly devoted to this.
Now let's get to work.

10:23.272 --> 10:25.940

cucumbers shoot sticky threads

10:33.967 --> 10:35.634
from their butts
as a form of defense?

10:35.785 --> 10:37.193
They look like butt noodles.

10:37.362 --> 10:38.803
-We're definitely doing that.

10:39.030 --> 10:40.472

-Oof!
-LOUISE: And then we

10:40.623 --> 10:41.306
all climb on the ropes,

jump at the Sinister Sea Sponge,

10:42.701 --> 10:44.534
which we'll totally nail,
he catches us,

10:44.536 --> 10:46.478
-spins around
and we take him down.
-(grunting)

10:47.389 --> 10:48.554
We call it
the Triple Cuke Nuke.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.707
All I'm gonna say is
of all the acts I have,

10:50.725 --> 10:52.984
yours is the one
I'm the most worried about.

10:53.136 --> 10:54.152
-Okay.
-Makes sense.

10:54.303 --> 10:55.636
And the Sinister Sea Sponge

10:55.805 --> 11:00.216
has one of the baby cukes
caught up in his spin cycle.

11:00.235 --> 11:02.810
Kill him! What?
I got to floss after I eat.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.996
21-day habit.
I just had popcorn.

11:05.073 --> 11:06.406
Oh, okay.
You turned away.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.984
Uh-oh!
He's got all three sea cukes

11:10.003 --> 11:11.318
cornered at the post.

11:11.487 --> 11:13.229
-(roars)
-It doesn't look good.
-(kids shouting)

11:13.398 --> 11:15.231
CAROL:
But wait-- the sea cucumbers

11:15.400 --> 11:18.401
just pulled noodles
from their butts,

11:18.420 --> 11:19.752
which, I believe,
is their natural,

11:19.829 --> 11:21.404
biological form of defense.

11:21.497 --> 11:22.755
And now the sea cukes
are stunning

11:22.832 --> 11:25.091
the Sinister Sea Sponge

11:25.185 --> 11:27.519
with their super-charged
toxic butt noodles!

11:27.670 --> 11:29.245
Aah!
Butt noodles!

11:29.338 --> 11:31.414
Triple Cuke Nuke.
Now!

11:31.416 --> 11:33.933
-Finish him!
-LOUISE: Jump!

11:34.085 --> 11:35.527
(all shouting, grunting)

11:35.678 --> 11:37.420
Call the coast guard!

11:37.439 --> 11:39.847
An amazing feat
that kind of worked.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.183
Give it up for the Barbaric

11:42.260 --> 11:44.035
Radioactive Baby Sea Cucumbers

11:44.187 --> 11:46.538
and their deadly butt noodles!

11:46.765 --> 11:48.448
Butt noodles!
Butt noodles!

11:48.542 --> 11:51.192
(all chanting): Butt noodles!
Butt noodles! Butt noodles!

11:51.286 --> 11:53.211
Shell yes, you love us!

11:53.438 --> 11:55.438
Butt noodles!
Butt noodles!

11:55.531 --> 11:57.173
-Yeah!
-Butt noodles! Butt noodles!

12:01.221 --> 12:02.554
That was incredible.
Do they give Academy Awards

12:02.705 --> 12:04.038
-for wrestling?
-Don't get me wrong,

12:04.207 --> 12:05.448
I love the attention.

12:05.467 --> 12:08.375
But I also think
I might need a new tailbone.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.802
Yeah, I thought
wrestling was supposed

12:09.896 --> 12:11.712
to be more fake
and less bruisey?

12:11.732 --> 12:14.290
That's just our bodies breaking.
You'll get used to it.

12:14.309 --> 12:15.567
-Cool, cool, cool.
-Yay.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.402
And we'll just keep practicing
and working harder

12:17.629 --> 12:20.238
until eventually, someone makes
action figures of us.

12:20.465 --> 12:22.148
Great, I love practicing more

12:22.300 --> 12:24.743

Well, guys, the Radioactive
Barbaric Baby Sea Cucumbers

12:49.828 --> 12:53.346
have become the fan favorites
of Crustacean Nation.

12:53.498 --> 12:56.441
So that's why I'm moving you
to the end of the show.

12:56.668 --> 12:58.184
You guys are gonna be
the closers.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.169
-Seriously?
-Wow. So cool.

13:00.188 --> 13:01.613
Um, hey just curious.

13:01.764 --> 13:04.932
How many more shows are we,
um, going to be doing, exactly?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.434
Love that question.
Very fresh, very now.

13:07.529 --> 13:09.178
Well, we've got our residency
at the rec center

13:09.197 --> 13:11.531
for another couple of weeks,
and then we go on the road.

13:11.683 --> 13:14.441
-Fantastic.
-Great...
-You don't say?

13:14.461 --> 13:15.985
Okay, well,
I got to go spray-paint

13:16.037 --> 13:17.295
angry eyebrows on an isopod.

13:17.446 --> 13:19.372
See you at the next practice,
show closers.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.857
-Bye, Carol!
-Bye, Carol.
-Bye, Carol.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.708
Show closers?
Is this real?

13:22.861 --> 13:24.302
Is this happening?
Tina, slap me.

13:24.453 --> 13:26.453
-Uh, fake slap or real slap?
-Real slap.

13:26.531 --> 13:28.197
-(grunts)
-Ow. Should've said fake slap.

13:28.258 --> 13:30.700
-But yeah.
-BOTH: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

13:31.460 --> 13:33.369
-Hey, everybody.
-Hey, Teddy.
-Hi, Teddy.

13:33.462 --> 13:35.146
-There he is.
-You're looking
a little stiff, Teddy.

13:35.298 --> 13:36.463
-You okay?
-Oh, sure.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.724
Just, uh, being
a Sinister Sea Sponge

13:38.819 --> 13:40.485
is kind of doing
a number on my back.

13:40.670 --> 13:42.211
-What number?
-Well, good news, Teddy.

13:42.230 --> 13:45.156
-Gene, Tina, drumroll?
-(both imitating drumroll)

13:45.233 --> 13:48.551
We got asked to headline
the show next week.

13:48.720 --> 13:49.810
Oh, that's great.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.055
Linda, can I get a straw
for my coffee?

13:52.073 --> 13:53.739
I can't tilt my head so good.

13:53.892 --> 13:55.149
Sure. Lunges!
(grunting)

13:55.168 --> 13:56.668
W-What's going on?
W-What are What are you doing?

13:56.819 --> 13:59.228
I'm getting my heart rate up.
It's my new habit.

13:59.322 --> 14:00.505
Short bursts
of intense exercise.

14:00.732 --> 14:02.990
-BOB: Hmm.
-I've been lunging everywhere.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.250
It's a fun way to get around.

14:04.402 --> 14:05.993
Okay, time to head to practice.

14:06.087 --> 14:07.403
We're going in
a little early today

14:07.422 --> 14:09.681
so we can work on nailing
the Triple Cuke Nuke,

14:09.832 --> 14:10.849
which will probably become

14:11.017 --> 14:12.592
the most famous
wrestling move in history,

14:12.686 --> 14:15.244
once we can do it without one
of us falling on their face

14:15.263 --> 14:16.429
and Gene farting that one time.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.672
Um, I was sort of hoping
to take a break

14:18.692 --> 14:20.174
from one or two practices

14:20.268 --> 14:22.694
to do anything else
for a little bit.

14:22.845 --> 14:24.937
-What?
-Yeah, this wrestling stuff
is all the time.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.014
I've already cut out homework,
but now

14:27.033 --> 14:29.092
-my TV-watching
is starting to suffer.
-Whoa, whoa, guys.

14:29.185 --> 14:31.703
We've found something
that we're really good at.

14:31.854 --> 14:34.372
And that thing is dressing up
like sea cucumbers

14:34.599 --> 14:35.707
and fighting each other.

14:35.858 --> 14:36.875
So now we just have to become

14:37.060 --> 14:38.784
the best at it
we possibly can be.

14:38.861 --> 14:40.545
-We owe it to the world.
-Ugh, fine.

14:40.622 --> 14:43.122
But the world better send us
an amazing thank-you card.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.699
-Squats! And squat, and squat.
-Aah! That was loud.

14:45.777 --> 14:47.385
Okay, first night as closers.

14:47.536 --> 14:49.445
Just do exactly what we did
in practice, but way better

14:49.464 --> 14:52.281
and different and correctly
and without crying, Teddy.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.117
I know you're passionate,
but come on.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.709
-Right. (moans)
-Okay.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.044
Let's go set up the stroller.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.213
Teddy, I'll see you
on the other side.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.215
-Heaven?
-No, in the ring?

15:01.292 --> 15:02.734
Sure.
I'm not gonna die.

15:02.885 --> 15:05.311
It's fine that we closed
the restaurant for this, right?

15:05.463 --> 15:07.238
Is this what it's like
when your kids do sports?

15:07.390 --> 15:08.555
-Is this sports?
-Sorry, Bob,

15:08.575 --> 15:10.241
I didn't listen
to what you just said.

15:10.393 --> 15:12.635
-I'm trying to be in the moment.
-No, I-I know.

15:12.654 --> 15:14.412
-This is the habit
that's gonna stick.
-Mm-hmm.

15:14.639 --> 15:16.397
Because all I have to do
is be mindful.

15:16.491 --> 15:18.082
-And in the moment.
-Are you supposed to keep saying

15:18.309 --> 15:20.309
you're being in the moment
when you're being in the moment?

15:20.328 --> 15:21.735
Leave me alone!
Moment.

15:21.829 --> 15:24.255
CAROL:
Ooh! Maximum Mussel
really brought the muscle

15:24.407 --> 15:26.332
-to the Horseshoe Hurricane.
-(groans)

15:26.484 --> 15:28.075
-Oh, boy.
-CAROL: All right,

15:28.094 --> 15:30.411
time for the final fight:

15:30.430 --> 15:32.597
your favorite
violent sea veggies.

15:32.824 --> 15:33.747
Let's bring 'em out!

15:33.767 --> 15:36.175
Butt noodles! Butt noodles!

15:36.327 --> 15:37.751
(all chanting):
Butt noodles! Butt noodles!

15:37.845 --> 15:40.421
Guys, we are butt noodle gods.
Let's give them a show.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.165
-Time to go cucular.
-BOTH: Okay.

15:42.183 --> 15:44.776
-(shouting)
-And here they are.
It's the Barbaric

15:44.927 --> 15:48.429
Radioactive Baby Sea Cucumbers.

15:48.597 --> 15:51.357
-(grunting)
-CAROL: Oh, shells bells.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.284
The sea cucumbers' archnemesis
is back.

15:53.511 --> 15:56.270
Will the Sinister Sea Sponge
wipe the ocean floor

15:56.289 --> 15:58.181
-with these babies?
-(grunting)

15:58.274 --> 16:01.626
-(grunting, shouting)
-♪ ♪

16:04.113 --> 16:05.371
(grunting)

16:05.465 --> 16:07.298
(distorted): Oh!

16:07.525 --> 16:10.876
And here come the butt noodles.
Oh,

16:11.045 --> 16:13.120
they're going into
the Whirlpool of Pain.

16:13.214 --> 16:15.122
-Round and round they go.
-(Teddy grunting)

16:15.216 --> 16:17.366
When they stop, he's gonna know.

16:17.385 --> 16:18.884
Teddy, you got
to pick me up now.

16:19.037 --> 16:20.886
Right, right.

16:21.039 --> 16:22.371
Aah!
My back!

16:22.465 --> 16:24.148
-Teddy. Oh, no!
-(Teddy grunts)

16:24.300 --> 16:26.042
It's okay. I'm okay.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.302
Nope. I'm seizing up. Oh...

16:28.321 --> 16:29.988
BOB:
Wait, is Teddy really hurt?

16:30.215 --> 16:31.823
I-Is this real or fake?

16:31.974 --> 16:34.141
And the Sea Sponge
took a big hit.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.235
And it isn't getting up.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.979
And not in a super fun way.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.482
-Uh-oh.
-Just, uh, keep whirlpooling.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.909
(chanting): Butt noodles!
Butt noodles!

16:44.004 --> 16:45.628
-(groaning)
-Butt noodles! Butt noodles!

16:49.734 --> 16:51.158
-(groaning)
-How long do we have to do this?

16:51.219 --> 16:52.844
I think it's making him better.

16:53.071 --> 16:54.253
Eh, no, it's not.

16:54.330 --> 16:55.738
Just keep going.
We're the closers.

16:55.757 --> 16:57.664
Always be closing.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.924
-(horn blows)
-Sorry, folks.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.760
I think we have to stop
this fight early.

17:00.912 --> 17:02.854
-We've got an injured
Sea Sponge.
-(audience booing)

17:03.005 --> 17:05.264
-EDITH: Get up, Sea Sponge!
-No!

17:05.416 --> 17:08.175
Don't stop the show.
I-I'll fight.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.752
I'll fight. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

17:09.845 --> 17:11.254
Okay, sorry. That's it, folks.

17:11.347 --> 17:13.256
No, please. Keep going.

17:13.424 --> 17:15.258
-Honor my memory.
-Wait. Uh...

17:15.426 --> 17:16.942
Ooh, oh, oh.
The Sinister Sea Sponge

17:17.095 --> 17:20.279
is being joined in the ring
by that guy.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.265
Uh, w-what? Me?

17:22.358 --> 17:23.783
Yes. Come in, come in.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.526
Oh, God. Uh, okay.

17:25.620 --> 17:26.878
Oh. All right.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.715
It seems like an average human
is now entering the ring.

17:30.866 --> 17:32.383
Definitely all a part
of the show.

17:32.535 --> 17:34.110
(whispers):
Teddy, I'm just gonna gently...

17:34.203 --> 17:35.369
-Sorry, sorry.
-(grunts)

17:35.463 --> 17:37.037
Put this on.
(loud): Whoa!

17:37.057 --> 17:40.966
It's the Sinister
Sea Sponge's evil brother,

17:41.061 --> 17:42.301
Sponge Hat.

17:42.453 --> 17:45.563
Uh, yeah. I'm gonna
get you, Sea Cucumbers.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.899
For hurting my brother's back.

17:48.050 --> 17:49.067
Aw, we're brothers.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.476
I<i> conch</i> believe it.

17:50.628 --> 17:53.296
It's the Sinister Sea Sponge's
brother,

17:53.314 --> 17:55.648
ready to exact his revenge,

17:55.742 --> 17:58.651
in the form of wrestling,
I hope?

17:58.803 --> 17:59.802
Oh, boy.

17:59.804 --> 18:01.579
(whispering): (grunts) Dad,

18:01.730 --> 18:03.397
we got to do our big final move.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.565
The Triple Cuke Nuke.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.567
We're gonna jump
from the ropes... (grunts)

18:06.586 --> 18:10.088
...and you catch us, spin around
with all three of us on you,

18:10.239 --> 18:11.923
and then fall down, okay?

18:12.150 --> 18:14.425
Wait, what? All three of you?
I-I can't.

18:14.652 --> 18:16.485
Sure you can,
you big strong boy.

18:16.579 --> 18:17.987
You can do it, Bobby.

18:18.005 --> 18:20.323
No, I'm not you, I can't catch
three kids and then spin.

18:20.341 --> 18:23.175
No, I know.
I was just trying to be nice.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.493
Wait, what if your mother
comes on stage

18:24.587 --> 18:26.420
-and we go back-to-back?
-That could work.

18:26.514 --> 18:30.441
And, oh, no,
here comes Sponge Hat's...

18:30.668 --> 18:32.335
-evil... sister.
-Wife.

18:32.428 --> 18:34.837
-Sister wife.
-Come on, sister wife.

18:34.856 --> 18:36.263
-Oh. Excuse me.
-LOUISE: Yeah.

18:36.357 --> 18:38.007
-CAROL: Wow! Okay.
-Excuse me.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.435
So now we've got another
surprise person-fighter.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.512
Just crab-tacular.

18:43.531 --> 18:44.938
-(Teddy groans)
-Sorry, sorry.
-Yes!

18:45.032 --> 18:48.534
I am the sister wife
of the evil brother.

18:48.686 --> 18:51.111
Sponge-Boob Square-Bra.

18:51.205 --> 18:52.779
-Nice.
-Lin, the kids
are gonna jump on us

18:52.874 --> 18:55.024
and we have to catch them,
spin around and then fall.

18:55.117 --> 18:56.542
-Oh, boy. Okay.
-Oh, God, oh, God.

18:56.694 --> 18:58.177
LINDA:
I'm in the moment,
I'm in the moment,

18:58.254 --> 18:59.453
-I'm in the moment...
-BOB: Oh, God...

18:59.530 --> 19:01.197
Now!

19:01.199 --> 19:03.474
(all yelling)

19:06.295 --> 19:09.388
LOUISE (distorted):
We're doing it!

19:09.482 --> 19:11.056
(all grunt)

19:11.209 --> 19:13.042
CAROL:
What an incredible finish!

19:13.060 --> 19:16.154
The Barbaric Radioactive
Baby Sea Cucumbers

19:16.322 --> 19:18.898
finally landed
their signature move.

19:19.050 --> 19:22.851
And the sponge family
is hung out to dry.

19:22.853 --> 19:24.811
-Yeah! We did it!
-Yeah!

19:24.831 --> 19:26.497
Yeah! Ha, ha, ha!

19:26.649 --> 19:27.907
Wow, this is great.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.168
Can someone drive me
to my chiropractor's, please?

19:30.395 --> 19:31.669
How you doing, Teddy?

19:31.820 --> 19:33.412
You think you'll be on your feet
for next Saturday?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.173
-Yep. In theory.
-Yeah, well,
whatever you come up with,

19:35.324 --> 19:36.674
I want it in my ring.

19:36.825 --> 19:40.085
Yeah, the thing is, Carol,
this was actually our last show.

19:40.238 --> 19:41.512
-ALL: What?
-Yeah. Sorry.

19:41.664 --> 19:44.682
I loved this so much
and we worked so hard.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.259
But I don't think the band is
gonna be able to stay together.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.428
We burned bright,
but it couldn't last.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.931
-Really?
-Yeah. It was only
a matter of time

19:52.025 --> 19:53.858
before we destroyed
our tiny bodies.

19:54.009 --> 19:56.694
And Teddy lost his ability
to stand or move.

19:56.845 --> 19:59.422
I mean, some of us
complained a little, or a lot,

19:59.515 --> 20:00.940
but I'm glad
you pushed us, Louise.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.608
Even though it was
annoying sometimes.

20:02.760 --> 20:03.943
Uh, most of the time.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.095
'Cause tonight,
we made something beautiful,

20:06.188 --> 20:08.097
-sort of?
-I mean, it was
kind of beautiful.

20:08.190 --> 20:11.116
-I thought it was beautiful.
-Anyway, we definitely
won't be able

20:11.269 --> 20:12.935
to do the Triple Cuke Nuke
again.

20:13.028 --> 20:14.378
And Teddy almost died.

20:14.605 --> 20:15.938
-Oh, God, is he dead?
-Nope, nope.

20:15.957 --> 20:17.882
-Just resting my eyes.
-Oh, phew.

20:18.109 --> 20:21.277
Yeah, so, thank you
for the opportunity.

20:21.295 --> 20:22.536
(whispers): I'll work on 'em.
We'll be back.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.204
(regular volume):
But, uh, we are done.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.890
Wow.
You guys are bad parents.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.225
You should make
your kids wrestle.

20:27.376 --> 20:28.893
-I'm kidding. You seem great.
-No, no.

20:29.044 --> 20:30.135
You-you were right
the first time.

20:30.288 --> 20:31.470
We get that a lot.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.047
You know, I do kind of
appreciate wrestling now.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.142
Now that I've done it.
But I never want to do it again.

20:37.295 --> 20:39.144
And my body is mad at me.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.463
Your body's probably mad at you

20:40.481 --> 20:42.222
for all sorts
of reasons, Father.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.557
Thank you, Louise.
So, Lin,

20:43.576 --> 20:45.392
are you sticking with this
in-the-moment stuff?

20:45.486 --> 20:48.320
-You seemed
sort of that tonight.
-Nope. I'm done.

20:48.473 --> 20:50.414
My new habit is to just
keep all my old habits.

20:50.566 --> 20:52.324
I'm sick of all this capricious
habit switching.

20:52.401 --> 20:54.085
Ooh, I used it right!
Maybe.

20:54.236 --> 20:55.753
LOUISE:
Ugh. We smell pretty bad.
