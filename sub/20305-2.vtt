NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.420 --> 00:06.172
You just get me Jesus Martinez
on this phone now, you dig?!

00:06.256 --> 00:07.340
Who's Jesus Martinez?

00:07.424 --> 00:09.092
He's talking about the warlord
of Los Diablos.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.010
Find him.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.261
I'm pregnant, Frank.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.178
Paul Grogan.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.014
Who else?

00:15.432 --> 00:16.391
What are you gonna do?

00:16.933 --> 00:17.851
I don't know.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.813
I don't know what you think you got here.
I haven't done nothing.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.357
The courier ID'd
the Valdez brothers in a lineup.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.860
We sweated them
and they both gave you up, Jesus.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.487
I wanted so much
to have natural childbirth,

00:29.571 --> 00:31.197
but, you know, Paul Grogan
doesn't want to be seen with me,

00:31.281 --> 00:33.283
so I don't have a delivery partner,

00:33.366 --> 00:36.286
and I'm really beginning to think
the whole thing's a horrible mistake.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.371
You had it all right there at your feet.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.331
You didn't want to make it.
You got scared.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.709
-You don't know beans.
-(scoffs)

00:42.792 --> 00:45.336
As I recall, it doesn't
have to be the real father.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.213
Just as long as it's somebody...

00:48.131 --> 00:49.215
I know.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.886
Well, I'm somebody.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.597
(police siren wails)

00:55.680 --> 00:57.932
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:58.016 --> 00:59.809
Who could've done such a terrible thing?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.187
I'll tell you this...

01:03.021 --> 01:04.355
I don't think it was you.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.983
A man is moving
into the Dante Projects tomorrow

01:07.067 --> 01:08.151
who's running for mayor.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.944
He wants to see what it's like, huh?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.613
Heard about the stabbing.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.449
It was about 20 feet away from the door
of the building you chose to move into.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.909
I thought you wanted to change things.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.410
I do. And I'm going to.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.204
Then help us to stop this killing.

01:19.287 --> 01:23.875
State law forbids the engaging
in political activity while in uniform.

01:24.375 --> 01:27.712
Beware of embarrassing the department
or mayoral candidate Daniels

01:27.796 --> 01:29.714
by failure to comply with this law.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.675
I don't care
if I am six points ahead in the polls.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.679
If we don't walk the line on this,
Fiske will close the gap like that.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.306
(laughter)

01:38.389 --> 01:40.850
Oh, I just won 100 grand!

01:40.934 --> 01:42.936
Betty, Babette, you okay?

01:43.019 --> 01:45.230
BOTH: Yeah, Artie, we're okay.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.774
We're scheduled an hour earlier
for our Lamaze class.

01:47.857 --> 01:48.775
I wouldn't miss it.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.568
Homestretch, kiddo.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.738
Testing, testing. One, two, three.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.785
ESTERHAUS: <i>Item five.</i>

01:59.536 --> 02:03.164
Detective Belker commences
Operation Piskador today

02:03.248 --> 02:05.416
at the, uh, Merton Fish and Poultry

02:05.500 --> 02:08.211
in the Dekker markets complex,
1,100 block...

02:08.294 --> 02:09.671
(laughter, indistinct conversations)

02:09.754 --> 02:11.589
MAN: Run into one of your girlfriends?

02:13.508 --> 02:17.137
Be attentive to your radios
for possible backup,

02:17.220 --> 02:19.347
uh, just for the "halibut."

02:19.430 --> 02:21.558
(laughter)

02:22.976 --> 02:29.649
Item six. From the war desk,
4:00 p.m. yesterday we, uh,

02:30.150 --> 02:33.653
record an ice pick attack
on a Tomás Hernández.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.364
Now, Mr. Hernández
is presently in critical,

02:36.447 --> 02:38.408
but stable condition at Mother of Mercy.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.617
He is a Diablo.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.245
If present patterns
of gang violence prevail,

02:42.328 --> 02:47.417
we can expect to learn rather quickly
whom the Diablos consider responsible.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.503
Since Jesus Martinez's

02:50.587 --> 02:53.673
inglorious departure
for Clarktown five months ago,

02:53.756 --> 02:56.217
we now total 37 incidents

02:56.301 --> 03:00.054
on turf that was once Diablo's
and is now no man's land.

03:00.346 --> 03:04.767
The recent ascendancy
of the alleged liberator, Lazaro Majana,

03:04.851 --> 03:08.605
over the beleaguered Diablos
only served to fan the flames.

03:08.688 --> 03:13.276
Five homicides in six weeks, 16 assaults,
three incidents of arson.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.988
For what it's worth,
our own war footing will continue.

03:17.071 --> 03:20.491
Patrols, let's triple our pass-bys
that know the gathering points.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.495
Interdict all gang members
on foreign turf.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.080
-Um, Sarge.
-What?

03:26.497 --> 03:28.499
-Could you define the word "interdict?"
-Stop.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.294
(laughter)

03:31.377 --> 03:34.881
And on account of any with whom
you've developed relations over the years,

03:34.964 --> 03:38.301
don't fail to urge them on the futility,

03:38.760 --> 03:41.679
the tragic waste
of this cycle of violence.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.014
Item seven.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.767
On this inhospitable horizon,

03:46.142 --> 03:50.271
appears this afternoon
a Councilman Benjamin Fiske.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.941
Mayoral candidate Fiske's resolve

03:53.024 --> 03:55.902
to move into the Dante Projects
appears unshakable.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.655
Special assignments
to be posted on the duty board

03:58.738 --> 04:01.157
after the councilman's
morning meeting with the captain.

04:01.241 --> 04:05.745
Let's check the board on each visit
to the squad room from here on out.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.498
People, more oft than not,

04:08.581 --> 04:11.960
we're gonna be double shifting
right through the election.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.128
-(groans)
-(chattering)

04:14.212 --> 04:19.342
In which further regard
a memo from Deputy Chief Mahoney.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.761
"You're reminded that state law forbids

04:21.844 --> 04:25.306
the engaging in political activity
while in uniform.

04:25.890 --> 04:29.185
Beware of embarrassing the department
or mayoral candidate Daniels

04:29.269 --> 04:31.479
by failure to comply with this law.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.483
Nothing in this reminder,
however, should be construed

04:35.566 --> 04:39.612
as restricting off-duty,
out-of-uniform activity.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.823
Members of this department are citizens.

04:41.906 --> 04:46.452
You have the right to campaign
as vigorously as you choose

04:46.536 --> 04:48.288
for the candidate of your choice.

04:48.371 --> 04:52.834
The department encourages you
to exercise this prerogative."

04:53.209 --> 04:55.336
Last item's also a memo...

04:55.795 --> 04:57.380
from vehicle maintenance.

04:57.463 --> 05:01.509
"Summer swan song brings
the worst time of filth in the cars.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.971
We could fill an encyclopedia
three truss."

05:06.097 --> 05:07.640
I believe that should be plural.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.309
(laughter)

05:09.392 --> 05:12.812
"Rags for cleaning dipsticks,
healthy and rotten food,

05:12.895 --> 05:15.732
personal aftereffects,
especially as the heat continues,

05:15.815 --> 05:17.608
as occupants of these vehicles,

05:17.692 --> 05:22.447
we ask you to remind--
to remember the heart of consideration.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.116
You may not remain in your units,

05:25.199 --> 05:28.202
but what you
leave in your units, remains."

05:28.286 --> 05:31.205
(laughter)

05:31.289 --> 05:33.249
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.544
-And hey, hey, hey, hey!
-(chairs scraping)

05:36.878 --> 05:38.921
Let's be careful out there, huh?

05:39.005 --> 05:40.757
(chattering)

05:43.426 --> 05:46.387
(telephone rings)

05:46.471 --> 05:47.722
Belker.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.516
Dekker Avenue, Mick?
Sounds like a fishy assignment.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.061
Hey, uh, be sure not
to "flounder" down there, Mick.

05:53.144 --> 05:53.978
Stop.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.022
-Mick, Mick--
-Not a word.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.484
-What, he's got a haddock or something?
-(Joe laughs)

05:59.567 --> 06:00.902
Officer Hill.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.363
I just got a call
from State Lottery Commission.

06:03.446 --> 06:07.158
It says you're holding
ticket number J7J7663

06:07.241 --> 06:11.579
-in the lottery's "Rainbow Runoff."
-Yeah.

06:11.662 --> 06:16.667
Well, it could be a gag,
but they say you just won 100 grand.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.923
J7J7663.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.257
Yeah!

06:23.341 --> 06:25.760
(screaming)

06:25.843 --> 06:27.345
<i>♪ Take my hand ♪</i>

06:27.428 --> 06:29.555
<i>♪ I'm a stranger... ♪</i>

06:30.765 --> 06:32.392
(laughter)

06:32.475 --> 06:34.894
Oh, I just won 100 grand!

06:34.977 --> 06:37.313
Sarge, Sarge, I just won $100,000!

06:37.397 --> 06:39.565
Oh, congratulations, Bobby.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.735
-$100,000, Sarge!
-$100,000.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.238
One-- (yelling)

06:45.321 --> 06:48.825
(yelling) Oh, Lord, I forgive everybody!

06:48.908 --> 06:51.744
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:51.828 --> 06:53.579
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:53.663 --> 06:57.417
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:57.500 --> 06:59.085
(sirens wailing)

07:04.549 --> 07:08.469
(theme music playing)

08:16.537 --> 08:18.080
LUCY: Come on, Joe. Will you hurry up?

08:18.164 --> 08:19.040
JOE: Well, what do you think I am?

08:19.123 --> 08:20.541
$100,000!

08:20.625 --> 08:22.335
JOE: If it looks so easy,
why don't you try it?

08:22.418 --> 08:23.669
LUCY: Police! Open up!

08:23.753 --> 08:25.296
RENKO: What seems to be the problem here?

08:25.379 --> 08:27.924
Somebody had a party
that got away from them in there.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.926
BOTH: $100,000.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.429
-(music playing)
-(clamoring)

08:37.433 --> 08:39.602
-I'll take care of this.
-Don't get killed now.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.187
No!

08:41.270 --> 08:42.438
(yelling)

08:42.522 --> 08:44.607
MAN: What are you doing?
What are you doing?

08:44.690 --> 08:47.360
-Oh, Lord. Will you please...
-(clamoring)

08:47.443 --> 08:50.154
LUCY: Will you get
your stupid body out of there?

08:50.238 --> 08:53.199
Get off her! Get off her!

08:53.282 --> 08:54.659
All right. Party's over.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.369
JOE: Just get your hands
against the wall.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.871
You want me out of here,
you come in and get me!

08:58.955 --> 09:00.915
(indistinct arguing)

09:03.417 --> 09:06.087
You're all covered in mud,
all messed up...

09:06.170 --> 09:07.755
This is my job!

All right. All right. That's it.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.517
-That's it. Come on.
-(woman screams)

09:19.600 --> 09:22.562
(chattering)

09:22.645 --> 09:24.021
-We paid you 50 bucks apiece!
-I get nothing.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.398
We didn't get nothing from her!

09:25.481 --> 09:26.816
Did they pay you for this?
Did they pay you for this?

09:26.899 --> 09:29.860
-No, they didn't pay me.
-Yes, we did! We paid you 50 bucks!

09:29.944 --> 09:32.196
Does this fall under the category
of entertainment, is that it?

09:32.280 --> 09:35.157
-You're under arrest.
-(indistinct conversations)

09:35.241 --> 09:37.326
LUCY: Good. Perfect.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.495
-You all right?
-MAN: What's going on over here?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.622
-What are you talking about?
-JOE: Who's this guy?

09:41.706 --> 09:43.833
Betty, Babette, you okay?

09:43.916 --> 09:46.252
BOTH: Yeah, Artie, we're okay.

-(thuds)
-(man groans)

09:50.423 --> 09:53.175
-Nobody hurts my girls! Nobody!
-Hey, just shut up.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.428
What's wrong with you? Cuff him, Bobby!

09:55.511 --> 09:57.930
Hey, wait a minute. I made the call.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.349
These guys come in here,
they're supposed to be out by 8:00.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.935
I didn't get my money.
My girls got attacked.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.145
I don't know what's going on here.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.230
Yeah? Well, I don't care. Cuff him!

10:06.314 --> 10:09.817
Everybody gets cuffed! Everybody.

10:09.900 --> 10:10.943
She took my wallet!

10:11.027 --> 10:12.528
All right, I'll tell you something.
We're going downtown.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.738
You'll find your wallet downtown.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.449
You want me to hose 'em down
before we put 'em in the car, or what?

10:16.532 --> 10:18.576
Grab a towel. I don't know.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.162
Ladies.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.247
Thanks.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.790
Thanks a lot.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.834
Hey, no problem.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.296
Are you girls twins or what?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.589
(both chuckle)

10:35.926 --> 10:37.470
(telephone rings)

10:40.306 --> 10:42.850
-Fay.
-Hi, Phil.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.019
Let's get you off your feet, here.

10:45.102 --> 10:48.522
Phil, I'm fine. Don't fuss.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.859
-Is Henry here?
-He's somewhere.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.778
Look, I was going through the baby book.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.613
-A few more names.
-Phil, I don't--

10:55.696 --> 10:57.198
Just consider 'em...

10:57.490 --> 11:01.202
with particular attention to Clarice
whilst I fetch Henry for you.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.039
JOE: Hey, Mrs. Furillo, how are you?

11:05.122 --> 11:07.583
Officer Coffey, Officer Bates.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.377
I mean, how do you feel?

11:09.460 --> 11:10.961
Ugh!

11:11.462 --> 11:14.423
Like I'm about to deliver
a basketball team.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.385
No, otherwise, I'm 40 years old,

11:17.468 --> 11:20.137
I'm three to five days
before I give birth,

11:20.221 --> 11:21.889
and I never felt better in my life.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.100
I wish you the best and God bless.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.060
-(chuckles) Thanks, Lucy.
-Let's go.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.770
-Can I touch it?
-Joe.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.313
Sure, go ahead.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.276
-(chuckles)
-Hey, did you feel that?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.277
Yeah. Yeah, it moved.

11:35.778 --> 11:36.612
It's amazing.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.991
Hiya, Fay. How goes it?

11:41.075 --> 11:43.744
-Hi, Henry.
-You look great.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.038
Henry, I-I came up to tell you

11:46.122 --> 11:48.499
that we're scheduled an hour earlier
for our Lamaze class,

11:48.582 --> 11:49.834
um, if it's convenient.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.836
I wouldn't miss it.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.255
Homestretch, kiddo.

12:02.471 --> 12:06.600
Fay, I don't know if I approve,
but, uh, you could catch a bug up here.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.645
Phil, I'm as healthy as a horse.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.897
(telephone ringing)

12:17.403 --> 12:19.280
Fay, how nice to see you.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.241
Chief Daniels. How's the campaign?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.785
By the look of it,
not quite so advanced as yours.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.954
Best of luck, Fay.
Good-good to see you.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.666
-Ramón, good to see you.
-Good morning, Chief.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.918
How's my minority affairs consultant, huh?

12:33.002 --> 12:34.962
Just fine. I'm eager to talk with you.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.088
And I'm eager to listen.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.258
-Have you set a time with Ron Lefferds?
-I'm waiting to hear back.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.470
Well, let's get on the stick, Ray.
I need your ideas.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.139
Will do. Will do, Chief.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.392
-(knocks)
-Top of the mornin', Frank.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.477
Chief.

12:49.810 --> 12:53.439
Hey, looks like your ex
is close to dropping the bomb.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.692
You know my pollster, don't you?
Byron Whitcamp. How are you?

12:57.109 --> 13:00.029
-Deputy Chief Mahoney will be joining us.
-FRANK: Fine.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.156
Have to hand it to Ben Fiske.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.699
He moves into the projects,

13:03.783 --> 13:06.952
I take up residence
between a rock and a hard place.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.662
I can see how that might be awkward.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.998
-Uh-huh.
-Sorry, gents.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.209
-Hello, Dennis.
-Frank, you know you've got, uh,

13:13.292 --> 13:15.544
units parked in all of the spaces
for visitors?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.881
Uh, I'll tell the khaki officer.

13:19.673 --> 13:23.052
All right. Here's how it shakes down,
Frank, Byron.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.388
If you give him full protection,
you validate his platform.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.848
Urban decay and all that.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.519
Under protect and he'll call you
on using your office to play politics.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.355
I don't care if I am six points
ahead in the polls--

13:34.438 --> 13:35.773
-BYRON: Eight.
-Or eight.

13:35.856 --> 13:39.693
If we don't walk the line on this,
Fiske will close the gap like that.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.154
Under protection just
isn't an option, Chief.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.866
Politically speaking, full protection
is by far the lesser of evils.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.327
Gentlemen, politics aside,

13:48.702 --> 13:50.830
the Dante Projects
are a war zone right now.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.540
It would be helpful
if both candidates realized

13:52.623 --> 13:54.124
that there's an agenda going on out there

13:54.208 --> 13:55.960
that couldn't have less to do
with this campaign.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.920
Five murders in six weeks.

13:58.462 --> 14:01.382
I'm not sure we can guarantee
anybody safety.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.761
I hope it'd be clear
that my personal safety

14:05.845 --> 14:07.263
is a subordinate issue here.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.472
(file cabinet closes)

14:09.098 --> 14:11.016
Captain, good to see you.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.644
-FRANK: Councilman Fiske.
-Ben.

14:14.562 --> 14:18.524
It's the living conditions of these people
in the projects that I'm concerned with.

14:18.774 --> 14:22.194
I think we might more properly leave that
for the rubber chicken crowd, Ben.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.738
Frank, I'll simply repeat.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.032
My deep reservations notwithstanding,

14:27.116 --> 14:29.535
Ben's to have full cooperation
and protection.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.663
Shall we leave them to it, gentlemen?

14:34.582 --> 14:36.250
Hope to hell you know
what you're doing, Ben.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.129
Hope to hell it works out.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.674
Well, I'll rest a lot easier
knowing that you're behind me, Fletcher.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.262
Henry, could you ask Howard
to step in here, please.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.475
I, uh, heard about
the stabbing on the way up.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.603
(sighs) Yeah, it happened
about 20 feet away

14:55.686 --> 14:57.688
from the door of the building
you chose to move into.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.732
You're not going to talk me out of this.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.775
Okay, then let me explain
this to you, Ben.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.986
Those projects belong to the Diablos,
not to the city,

15:04.069 --> 15:05.404
not to any federal agency.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.281
There's been a power struggle
inside the Diablos

15:07.364 --> 15:08.866
and they've been weakened.

15:09.241 --> 15:13.162
Blood and Mau Mau are trying to muscle in.
People have been killed.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.080
I'd be less than honest
if I didn't say to you

15:15.164 --> 15:17.458
that what you're doing
is ill-timed and ill-conceived.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.002
Lieutenant?

15:20.336 --> 15:23.005
It's theater.
The place is about to explode.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.468
Well, I'm going ahead with it anyway.

15:27.927 --> 15:28.969
I think it's stupid.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.596
I'm not a stupid man...

15:31.221 --> 15:32.473
or a reckless one,

15:33.223 --> 15:36.226
but these people have to know
that somebody is willing to listen.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.604
FRANK: Lieutenant Hunter here
will be in charge of security.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.230
-Councilman.
-Lieutenant.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.025
An adventure awaits you.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.736
Excuse me, gentlemen.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.030
Francis, we have a homicide
at the Dante Projects.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.741
-HENRY: Gangs?
-Just found the body.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.914
WOMAN (on PA): <i>Need someone</i>
<i>to sign for shipment on dock four.</i>

15:56.997 --> 15:59.375
-Dump 'em.
-(ice rustles)

16:00.501 --> 16:02.252
-You know fish?
-I know a little.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.838
-Yeah, I've been in business 30 years.
-Long time.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.590
Yeah, 30 big ones.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.258
I know fish.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.511
(fish scales scraping)

16:10.803 --> 16:12.304
Are you sure this is gonna work?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.723
I mean, the guy that threatened me
was like a tractor.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.517
Don't worry about it.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.978
I need a whale, they send me a shrimp.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.980
WOMAN (on PA):
<i>Rossi, phone call, line two.</i>

16:21.063 --> 16:24.066
Testing, testing. One, two, three.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.317
Testing, testing.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.028
You know, the guy said
if I don't come up with the cash today

16:28.112 --> 16:29.738
they're gonna stop the deliveries,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.949
they're gonna stop hauling away
all my extras,

16:32.032 --> 16:33.617
plus, they're gonna bust my arms.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.412
We get them on tape,
you're not gonna have any more trouble.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.791
Better light that up,
help the smell a little.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.626
WOMAN: Mr. Merton.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.965
So, Mr. Merton,
am I gonna have a birthday here?

16:49.174 --> 16:53.012
Oh, uh, he's got you,
uh, Mrs. Silverman, yeah.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.433
How could I help you, ma'am?

16:57.516 --> 16:59.768
That chicken is fresh?

17:00.144 --> 17:02.438
You kidding? That chicken
was running around this morning.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.356
Yeah, well, let me see.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.986
WOMAN (on PA):
<i>Would the driver of the truck</i>

17:09.069 --> 17:11.488
<i>parked at the loading dock</i>
<i>please move it?</i>

17:13.157 --> 17:14.283
(sniffs)

17:14.366 --> 17:16.326
This chicken is not fresh.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.704
I want very fresh.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.876
WOMAN (on PA): <i>Does someone</i>
<i>have the bill of lading</i>

17:23.959 --> 17:25.502
<i>for the poultry delivery?</i>

17:31.341 --> 17:33.927
This chicken is not fresh.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.680
I want fresh chicken!

17:36.764 --> 17:39.016
Lady, could you pass a test like that?

17:44.313 --> 17:45.898
(police siren wails)

17:46.774 --> 17:48.817
NEAL: Chalk up another one.
These dudes don't waste any time.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.611
HENRY: I thought we were
getting more crowd control?

17:50.694 --> 17:53.030
-NEAL: They're on the way.
-HENRY: Any ID on the victim?

17:53.113 --> 17:55.657
NEAL: Leon Selwood. He was a Blood.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.409
According to SID,

17:57.493 --> 18:00.120
they killed him someplace else
and then strung him up here.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.748
Hey, that cold enough for you?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.792
They snuff the kid
and then hang out and watch.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.085
Probably wasn't them.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.836
Diablo turf,

18:08.170 --> 18:10.714
a Blood strung up by his colors
and you don't think Diablos did it?

18:10.798 --> 18:12.424
There are two groups of Diablos.
They're just a splinter.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.009
How fast can they get him down?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.345
Almost done.
They just gotta finish dusting.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.764
-How fast?
-Five, ten minutes.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.266
Tell them five, no more.
There could be more trouble.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.312
Hector, can I talk to you a second?

18:31.443 --> 18:34.780
It's, uh, too bad about the Blood, Henry.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.407
I wonder who could've done
such a terrible thing.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.451
I'll tell you this...

18:40.536 --> 18:41.829
I don't think it was you.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.289
You're too smart for something like this.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.666
Maybe.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.835
Maybe not.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.545
-But then who's to say?
-(car door opens, closes)

18:49.837 --> 18:51.755
Look, we can do each other some good here.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.507
-I don't see how.
-Sure you do.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.885
(chattering)

18:57.094 --> 18:58.178
It's gotta be now.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.430
Come see me, Hector.
I'll be back in my office in half an hour.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.723
Hey! Hey, you! Hold it!

19:01.807 --> 19:03.892
Okay. Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.227
Let me talk to you. Let me talk to you.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.147
Man, look what they did to my bro--
my man Leon, man!

19:08.230 --> 19:10.274
Get out of here. Go on. Now.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.317
We're Blood.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.237
And we're here for our brother's body.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.698
HENRY: This is a crime scene
and you gotta stay clear.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.741
You're damn right it's a crime, man!

19:20.325 --> 19:24.121
That's my brother laying up there dead!
That's the crime!

19:24.496 --> 19:26.039
HENRY: You call up the station house.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.292
We'll let you know the minute
the body's released.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.918
You ask for me, Lieutenant Goldblume.

19:31.753 --> 19:32.629
Go.

19:33.839 --> 19:34.923
Go on.

19:35.924 --> 19:36.925
We're going.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.760
(police siren wailing)

19:38.844 --> 19:40.262
And we're coming back.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.683
You hear that, punk? We're coming back!

19:45.100 --> 19:46.310
I'm waiting for you, brother.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.395
-You be here, square.
-Your mama.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.901
(helicopter whirring)

20:07.164 --> 20:08.832
WOMAN: You lying creep.
Trying to make us look bad.

20:08.916 --> 20:09.833
MAN: I want some justice here!

20:09.917 --> 20:13.503
My clients are not about to drop
any attempted rape charges.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.964
Then my clients won't drop grand larceny.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.883
That grand larceny is a crock.

20:17.966 --> 20:18.884
Your rape's a crock.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.761
How can you say that? And you're a woman.

20:20.844 --> 20:24.681
Mr. Feinstein, these are cross complaints.
There's no outside witness.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.684
The only thing likely to result
from pursuing the matter any further

20:27.768 --> 20:30.229
is a stack of legal bills
and an early dismissal.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.605
What kind of legal bills?

20:31.688 --> 20:32.564
We'll talk about it. Don't worry.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.025
JOYCE: I can't be specific,
but on the average

20:35.108 --> 20:37.444
if we even go to a hearing, $3,500.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.946
BOTH: $3,500?

20:39.029 --> 20:39.863
JOYCE: Shall we drop it?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.698
Hey, wait a minute!
I ain't droppin' nothin'!

20:41.782 --> 20:43.575
Shut your pants, pumpkin head!

20:43.659 --> 20:45.118
Mr. Thompson, I thought we agreed.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.287
Agreed, sure, if the thieves
give me back my wallet.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.039
BOTH: We didn't steal your wallet!

20:49.122 --> 20:50.123
It was in my pants!

20:50.207 --> 20:52.292
Look, Hal, you know, maybe we can
split the difference here.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.503
-You guys ain't behind me on this?!
-Sure, we're behind you, but--

20:54.586 --> 20:56.964
Whore accuses me of rape!
I am taking her to court!

20:57.047 --> 20:58.048
So forget everything else.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.759
It was my wallet and I ain't walking away.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.469
Whatever you say, Mr. Thompson.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.596
Be prepared for a civics lesson.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.724
Hal, what, are you crazy?
Have lost your mind?

21:07.808 --> 21:12.104
(clamoring)

21:17.943 --> 21:20.696
Well, uh, you girls want some
soap or something to...

21:20.779 --> 21:22.447
to wash up before you get on the bus?

21:22.531 --> 21:23.949
BOTH: You got a bathroom?

21:24.533 --> 21:26.743
Yeah, but, I'm gonna have to guard you.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.453
-Whoo.
-(laughs)

21:28.537 --> 21:31.915
-On the outside. Outside the door.
-BOTH: Oh.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.960
-(typewriter clacking)
-(telephone rings)

21:35.043 --> 21:36.003
Henry.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.714
There's someone waiting for you in lineup.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.426
If Frank asks for the homicide report...

21:43.927 --> 21:45.137
You kept saying "come in."

21:46.054 --> 21:47.347
What the hell does that mean?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.808
I guess what you're doing now.

21:50.642 --> 21:54.062
I ain't doing nothing, man.
I'm just seeing what you got to say.

21:56.481 --> 22:00.235
We try to keep tabs, Hector.
We saw the new Diablos flier.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.322
Milk programs,
escort service for the elderly.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.990
That's right. What's it to you?

22:06.158 --> 22:07.284
Those are good ideas.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.662
And with the bloodletting going on,
not one of them has a chance.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.164
So what?

22:13.248 --> 22:16.043
If I were you,
I'd figure they had a lot better chance

22:16.126 --> 22:17.502
with Lazaro out of the way.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.629
Just take more blood.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.465
Not necessarily.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.926
Not if someone could put him
at that homicide or giving the order.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.428
That's not how we do it.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.807
-Who?
-Us, man. <i>La gente.</i>

22:30.891 --> 22:33.810
We don't work that way, bro.
We don't use cops doing our business.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.437
I thought you wanted to change things?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.230
I do. And I'm going to.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.400
Then help us do our job.
Help us to stop this killing.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.654
And do some good for yourself
at the same time.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.282
What the hell kind of loyalty
do you owe someone

22:47.366 --> 22:48.742
who's gonna come after you

22:49.284 --> 22:50.660
the day he finishes fighting
the other gang?

22:50.744 --> 22:52.079
Someone who's a stone killer?

22:52.162 --> 22:54.331
Man, Lazaro is way
out of his league, all right?

22:54.414 --> 22:57.125
I mean, the guy is nothing
but Jesus Martinez's right-hand man,

22:57.209 --> 22:58.335
his enforcer.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.128
He ain't made to head no gang.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.173
Yeah, well, Jesus is upstate
and Lazaro is killing people.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.218
Man, it's you, man.
You're the one that-that makes us...

23:06.551 --> 23:08.470
Man, you are the beast.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.474
That's jail talk, Hector.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.643
This is the outside.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.856
You really want to try your ideas?
You ready to do some good?

23:21.441 --> 23:23.026
I wouldn't. I...

23:24.444 --> 23:26.738
I wouldn't make no-no testimony. I...

23:27.697 --> 23:29.908
It would have to come from a--
from a phone booth.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.711
(telephone rings)

23:41.795 --> 23:43.797
-What's up, Frank?
-Hector.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.802
We can get something from him, Frank.
He's talking about giving up Lazaro.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.887
-Was he at the murder?
-He'd inform.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.347
It'd be the beginning of a case.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.808
-In exchange for?
-Our backing his group.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.562
He's an unstable kid with five
or six teenagers behind him.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.730
He's also got a lot of good ideas.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.608
Let's see what we accomplish
with the summit.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.944
What summit?

24:06.153 --> 24:07.904
We're bringing in the gang leaders
this afternoon

24:07.988 --> 24:11.199
-to see if we can buy a truce.
-Captain. Lieutenant.

24:12.909 --> 24:13.869
Counselor.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.415
I understand you're working
the mud wrestling circuit.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.334
Your people got there
just before the main event.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.128
Listen, I'm going to be late tonight.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.129
Again?

24:24.212 --> 24:26.256
Well, maybe you and some of the boys

24:26.339 --> 24:29.050
can catch the, uh,
dinner show at The Mud Palace.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.679
A moment of your time, Ms. Davenport.

24:32.762 --> 24:36.308
-I'm afraid that's all I've got, Sarge.
-I just want to get a woman's perspective.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.729
(telephone rings)

24:47.736 --> 24:49.696
Hmm? What do you think?

24:49.779 --> 24:52.657
(laughs) It's lovely.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.868
Fay's coming to term
in three to five days.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.829
It's a little big for a newborn, isn't it?

24:57.913 --> 25:01.374
Oh, this is for seven to eight months.
I'm amassing a progressive ensemble.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.376
I'm the child's godfather, you know.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.630
So I understand.
It's really lovely, Sergeant.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.256
I'm really flying blind.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.551
I'm just, uh... going from
one moment to the next.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.721
You're doing fine.

25:16.389 --> 25:21.311
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Roger. 7L94, 7L94.</i>
<i>45984. 45...</i>

25:21.394 --> 25:23.438
All right. The first thing I'm gonna get

25:23.522 --> 25:26.274
is a pair of those good-looking boots
that we were looking at.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.193
-You mean snakeskin?
-Yeah, they were nice.

25:28.276 --> 25:31.196
-Ooh, I could use a pair of them myself.
-That'll be nice.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.532
Robert, do you remember
a conversation we had,

25:33.615 --> 25:36.993
we made a vow and swore
an eternal vow on our friendship?

25:37.077 --> 25:38.161
Which was that?

25:38.245 --> 25:40.455
It happened in this very vehicle
about six months ago.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.375
Something about, uh,
unexpected strokes of fortune.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.627
After that armored truck job?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.963
Uh-huh. We found that $1.6 million.

25:48.296 --> 25:51.007
Something about sharing found money.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.219
Oh, I just thought
we were chewing the fat, Renko.

25:54.302 --> 25:55.470
Huh. Yeah.

25:55.845 --> 25:58.765
Which doesn't mean I'm not gonna be
spreading this around.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.475
Renko, would you just let me
get my feet on the ground?

26:00.559 --> 26:02.102
-Robert, I'm sorry.
-I haven't even got the check yet.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.312
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-All right.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.731
(stutters)
I was just thinking, you know...

26:07.315 --> 26:09.734
Andy, I have never won...

26:09.818 --> 26:12.487
(mouths words) ...before.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.823
-Ain't that the truth.
-(both laugh)

26:14.906 --> 26:16.908
I gotta figure out
how to organize all this.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.410
What do you think I ought to do, Renko?

26:18.493 --> 26:21.121
Well, first off, I think you
ought to get real cautious.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.206
You're gonna have people
running at you from all sides

26:23.290 --> 26:24.624
to share in your good fortune.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.167
-Police! Open up!
-You think so?

26:26.251 --> 26:28.253
I do. I definitely do think so.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.713
-Yeah, what?
-(man speaking Spanish on TV)

26:29.796 --> 26:32.007
-Lazaro Majana?
-Yeah, that's me.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.800
You get a call
to come down to the station?

26:33.883 --> 26:35.302
-Yeah.
-Free ride.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.016
BOBBY: Come on, let's shake it, man.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.855
Boy, it seems like all of a sudden

26:46.938 --> 26:48.815
I've got a whole lot
to think about, Renko.

26:48.898 --> 26:52.652
Yeah, a whole lot of responsibility
comes with that amount of money.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.112
(car door opens)

26:54.863 --> 26:56.615
I'm not riding with a Mau Mau.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.826
Yes, you are, and you ain't
gonna say one more word to me.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.369
(car door opens)

27:05.081 --> 27:06.791
(car door screeches)

27:06.875 --> 27:09.753
-Stinks back here.
-Then shut your mouth.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.380
And get off me!

27:13.673 --> 27:14.633
Hey!

27:14.966 --> 27:17.552
Now, gentlemen, travel time
is approximately 12 minutes.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.638
Don't make me come sit back here.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.307
(car engine revs)

27:22.390 --> 27:25.185
WOMAN (on PA): <i>The driver of the truck</i>
<i>parked at loading dock three,</i>

27:25.268 --> 27:26.436
<i>please move it.</i>

27:27.395 --> 27:29.773
-Your boss around?
-Who's asking?

27:30.732 --> 27:31.775
You don't want to know.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.736
You got the contracts?

27:37.072 --> 27:41.326
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well, my boss told me to handle it.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.912
Uh, you wanna come over here?
There's more light.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.086
Just sign all three copies.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.090
Eight-hundred pounds of scrod
is a lot of scrod.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.299
It's all been signed.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.886
Don't play with the merchandise.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.597
Janitorial service?

28:02.681 --> 28:04.974
I think we got a janitorial service.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.518
We'll give you better.

28:06.601 --> 28:09.229
Our janitorial service
you don't get burned down.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.731
MICK:
You wanna keep your hands off the carp?

28:11.815 --> 28:12.732
It's very delicate.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.027
-What is this?
-Police officer.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.280
(groans)

28:20.782 --> 28:22.117
(both grunting)

28:37.507 --> 28:38.591
(groans)

29:02.824 --> 29:06.369
You are under arrest, fishbowl!

29:06.453 --> 29:08.580
(man coughing)

29:14.627 --> 29:16.838
Congratulations, Mr. Hill.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.966
That's it? I can go cash it?

29:20.049 --> 29:22.302
It's all yours. Hold it up.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.053
WOMAN: How does it feel, Officer Hill?

29:25.263 --> 29:27.682
It's-it's great. It just feels great.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.726
Give us one of you
and Mr. Jefferson together.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.394
Oh, Mr. Jefferson, come on in.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.605
(reporters clamoring)

29:34.397 --> 29:36.107
-What do you say, Bobby?
-Yeah.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.818
Worth a couple bucks to the man
who sold you the winning ticket?

29:39.527 --> 29:41.780
BOBBY: This ain't no check for $500.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.240
The last winner tipped
the seller five percent.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.075
The man knew how to be grateful.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.786
(camera shutter clicking)

29:49.829 --> 29:51.456
MAN: Mr. Hill?

29:51.539 --> 29:54.542
Officer Hill, uh, can you
shake hands with my boy?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.670
This is Timmy.
Timmy, shake hands with the officer.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.089
Yeah, sure. How are you doing, Timmy?

30:00.173 --> 30:02.425
Uh, not good, Officer. Not good at all.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.719
Timmy, tell the officer how you feel.

30:04.803 --> 30:08.139
Mr. Whip, I'm tired of warning you
about soliciting on these premises.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.934
The next time I see you here
I am calling the authorities.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.018
My kid's sick.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.270
He's gotta have an operation
or he's gonna die.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.314
-The kid's sick?
-He's as healthy as a mule.

30:16.397 --> 30:19.150
I'm afraid you've gotta
look out for these types.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.151
Good luck.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.487
(chattering)

30:28.368 --> 30:30.787
Well, morning, Chief Mahoney.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.914
-Boss in back?
-MICK: Right here. Stand still.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.124
-Yes, sir.
-MICK: Hey, knock it off.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.838
OFFICER: Evidence or lunch?

30:40.296 --> 30:41.297
Hands on the counter.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.633
I owe you one. (grunts)

30:43.716 --> 30:44.843
(man groans)

30:44.926 --> 30:47.720
-(thudding)
-(both grunting)

30:47.804 --> 30:49.264
All right. That's enough.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.891
(growls) Don't! Don't do that!

30:51.975 --> 30:54.269
Take your hands off me, you little ape!

30:59.065 --> 31:00.191
(sighs) I'm very--

31:00.275 --> 31:02.318
Turn in your shield, mister.
You're on report.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.529
-What's your name?
-Belker, sir.

31:04.612 --> 31:06.281
-I was not--
-Shut up and stand there.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.826
Get this fish out of here.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.040
This is Deputy Chief Mahoney.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.169
Get someone from your office
down to, uh, Hill Street.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.505
I want to file charges against--

31:22.589 --> 31:25.383
-What's your first name?
-Michael.

31:25.466 --> 31:26.885
Detective Michael Belker.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.637
Well, tell him to look for me.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.891
Turn in your hardware and take your desk.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.560
-What's the problem here?
-No problem.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.271
-He was not wearing his tag--
-That's enough from you, son.

31:38.354 --> 31:39.230
Take your desk.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.318
Your office, Captain.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.660
Mick... Come on, huh?

31:53.328 --> 31:54.370
Come on.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.960
Your boy's got a hair trigger, Frank.

32:01.377 --> 32:02.712
Heat of the moment, Dennis. He was--

32:02.795 --> 32:05.465
He was working out on a citizen's skull
is what he was doing.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.008
And nobody moved in to stop him.

32:07.842 --> 32:10.219
Damn. This suit just came back
from the dry cleaners.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.472
He said you weren't wearing your ID.

32:12.555 --> 32:13.723
So what am I to conclude?

32:14.682 --> 32:16.267
That as a matter of course
anybody who walks in here

32:16.351 --> 32:17.936
without a tag is assaulted?

32:18.519 --> 32:19.562
If you'd identified yourself--

32:19.646 --> 32:22.231
Excessive force
and assaulting a superior officer,

32:22.315 --> 32:23.483
it goes to IAD.

32:23.816 --> 32:26.319
And I get to explain to my wife
why I smell like fish.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.363
All right, now,
run this gang thing for me.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.907
Excuse me. Uh, they're ready
downstairs, Francis.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.617
Thanks, Phil. This'll have to wait.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.285
Maybe they should.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.454
Dennis, I have people down there
who are ready to kill each other.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.789
You'll have to excuse me.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.250
(footsteps walking away)

32:41.334 --> 32:42.710
Any word on the release?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.421
Well, he's supposed to be in a cab
on his way up here.

32:47.006 --> 32:49.467
Man, if there's a meeting,
we're supposed to be there, all right?

32:49.550 --> 32:51.761
-I don't know if now's--
-You said one thing, Henry.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.137
I didn't guarantee.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.807
Your back, Hector. No scenes.

32:59.894 --> 33:00.812
HECTOR: Come on, man.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.482
FRANK: A man is moving into
the Dante Projects tomorrow

33:04.565 --> 33:05.566
who's running for mayor.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.485
(laughter)

33:07.568 --> 33:08.653
To visit his mother, huh?

33:08.736 --> 33:10.905
He wants to see what it's like, huh?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.992
FRANK: I know those projects
are disputed territory,

33:14.075 --> 33:16.285
but if there's any violence
in those projects,

33:16.369 --> 33:18.663
anything that endangers this man's life,

33:19.038 --> 33:20.748
the police are gonna shoot to kill.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.084
-MAN: What's new, man?
-ALL: Ooh!

33:23.668 --> 33:24.794
Like beef.

33:24.877 --> 33:28.840
Is it understood? 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,
the Dante Projects are off-limits.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.175
That's one.

33:32.885 --> 33:33.928
The other's this.

33:36.639 --> 33:39.142
I'm putting the leaders on notice.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.435
In the past six weeks,

33:40.518 --> 33:42.854
there have been six murders
in my precinct.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.230
My precinct.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.733
You got a war,
you got your own system of justice,

33:46.816 --> 33:47.650
that's fine.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.528
I put you on notice.

33:50.611 --> 33:53.573
From this day I say
the leader of each gang

33:53.656 --> 33:56.534
is responsible for the crime,
Furillo's Law.

33:56.617 --> 33:59.037
(laughter)

33:59.495 --> 34:01.664
Blood, Ronnie James.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.166
Mau Mau, Dudley Hicks.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.251
Blood commits a crime,
Mau Mau commits a crime,

34:05.334 --> 34:06.794
you two get put away.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.421
And I'll make it stick.

34:08.504 --> 34:10.381
Shamrock, Tommy Mann.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.592
Dragons, Russell Mobley.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.052
Diablos...

34:15.136 --> 34:16.888
Jesus Martinez.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.681
What the hell are you saying, man?

34:19.057 --> 34:21.976
That's just how jive you are, Furillo.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.645
-Martinez is upstate.
-MAN: That's right.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.607
LAZARO: You're rolling
some big numbers, Furillo.

34:28.441 --> 34:30.485
Your laws and your rules.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.280
Let me tell you, Jesus gets out--

34:34.363 --> 34:35.406
No, Lazaro.

34:35.490 --> 34:36.657
(men chattering)

34:37.200 --> 34:38.993
My strong right arm.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.042
Jesus Martinez is out.

34:47.835 --> 34:51.589
Jesus, you're looking kind of used.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.133
They must have turned you out up there.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.345
No one turns me out!

34:59.388 --> 35:01.808
What, you want to touch it?

35:02.100 --> 35:05.394
You and I will discuss
this one on the streets.

35:06.604 --> 35:07.647
Wherever you want.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.398
(speaks Spanish) Come on.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.738
(chair scraping)

35:18.324 --> 35:22.120
Yo, Furillo, go ahead. Continue, please.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.583
When Lazaro gets outside

35:27.667 --> 35:30.586
he'll be arrested for the murder
of Leon Selwood.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.257
From today, you're responsible.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.679
-NATE: You better move it, man!
-LAZARO: Let go of me!

35:39.762 --> 35:42.807
Hey, pig! You brought me here
under amnesty!

35:42.890 --> 35:44.642
You were arrested on the outside.

35:44.725 --> 35:46.227
-NEAL: Come on!
-Get off me!

35:46.310 --> 35:49.272
-You jacked me up, Henry.
-I didn't know, Hector.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.190
Oh, man, you told me
you was gonna put me in charge.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.108
You lied, man.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.193
All the time you're bringing
him back, right?

35:54.277 --> 35:56.821
Yo, Hector, what's this
I hear about you, huh?

35:56.904 --> 36:00.032
You in charge of the young Diablos?
Los Diablitos.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.451
-(spits)
-Are you crazy, man?!

36:02.535 --> 36:03.953
Hold it!

36:04.036 --> 36:05.955
Henry, clear them out of here.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.877
Get off, okay? Get off of me.

36:14.589 --> 36:18.134
Damn good idea
arresting this Lazaro youth, Frank.

36:18.217 --> 36:21.679
I'll tell you, this preventative retention
is working wonders in South Africa.

36:21.762 --> 36:23.890
We have a case against him, Howard.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.560
Of course you do.

36:32.523 --> 36:33.482
Mick.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.196
-Captain.
-Mick.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.660
(scoffs) I ain't never been up
in front of IAD before.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.291
I want you to know
I would never do anything

36:50.374 --> 36:52.835
to embarrass this department or you.

36:53.377 --> 36:54.545
I know that, Mick.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.589
I'd quit before I'd let that happen.

36:56.672 --> 36:59.133
Well, you're a long way
from having to worry about that.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.260
(scoffs) I don't know what happened.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.056
The guy was resisting
and Mahoney grabbed me from behind.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.350
That's exactly what you'll tell IAD.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.728
What kind of trouble could they give me?

37:11.729 --> 37:13.606
I don't know, Mick,
but it's not just you, you know.

37:13.689 --> 37:15.149
Mahoney has it in for the whole precinct.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.152
Yeah, well,
he can't get away with that, right?

37:22.365 --> 37:23.950
I bet everything's gonna be okay.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.869
-Just tell the truth.
-(garbage can clangs)

37:26.953 --> 37:28.579
Tell the truth,
they can't hurt you, right?

37:35.753 --> 37:36.796
(door closes)

37:36.879 --> 37:39.048
(telephone rings)

37:45.805 --> 37:47.056
Pretty slick, Frank.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.891
The hidden Martinez trick.

37:53.479 --> 37:54.397
Come in.

38:01.862 --> 38:03.406
When did you start working on his release?

38:03.489 --> 38:04.532
Two days ago.

38:05.032 --> 38:08.035
He was eligible for an early parole.
I just asked them to expedite.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.079
Nice going. You really
kept it under your hat.

38:10.162 --> 38:12.248
I did what I thought
was appropriate, Henry.

38:12.331 --> 38:15.251
You thought it was appropriate
making an ass of me and a liar?

38:16.377 --> 38:17.837
I had to buy a truce.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.673
Do you know what an assassination
would do to this city?

38:20.756 --> 38:24.385
I'm talking command policy.
You kept me and everyone else in the dark.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.762
I just didn't think there was enough time.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.641
Didn't feel there was enough time, Frank,
or didn't really feel it was necessary?

38:30.725 --> 38:32.018
Just figured you'd be the kingmaker?

38:32.101 --> 38:32.935
Henry...

38:34.103 --> 38:36.647
Phil coordinated the release,
Ray organized the summit,

38:36.731 --> 38:38.274
you were detective in charge
of a new homicide.

38:38.357 --> 38:40.067
I just didn't see any opportunity.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.653
We stood in that hallway and talked!

38:42.737 --> 38:46.282
And you tried to sell me a kid
as new leader of the Diablos

38:46.365 --> 38:48.701
who'd go off like cheap fireworks
the first time he got frustrated.

38:48.784 --> 38:49.618
So we disagreed!

38:49.702 --> 38:53.247
Does that give you the right to-to
shut me out of policy?

38:53.914 --> 38:56.709
To make me into a lying,
conniving manipulator?

38:57.710 --> 38:58.836
I'm sorry.

38:59.837 --> 39:00.671
I just...

39:01.255 --> 39:02.840
(stutters) I stood there with you

39:02.923 --> 39:06.344
and I saw a 20-minute
argument coming and...

39:09.680 --> 39:12.516
So you failed to respect me as a person
and I passed it on.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.564
Well, I hope you got what
you wanted out of it, Frank.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.401
'Cause I bet we're gonna pay
on the other end.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.237
I'll bet on it.

39:30.326 --> 39:33.788
My papers indicate
that as to these various

39:33.871 --> 39:36.415
and very serious cross complaints,

39:36.499 --> 39:41.253
attempted rape, robbery, sex abuse,
assault, grand larceny...

39:42.213 --> 39:44.882
All defendants are agreeable
to dropping charges

39:44.965 --> 39:48.344
except one Mr. Thompson.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.012
Whore stole my wallet.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.263
Hey, watch your mouth.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.808
JUDGE: Can't we settle
this matter, Ms. Davenport?

39:54.517 --> 39:55.768
JOYCE: I'm afraid not, Your Honor.

39:55.851 --> 39:56.936
I did try.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.813
I've also informed them

39:58.896 --> 40:01.357
that they'll get a public defender
for arraignment only.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.442
They can afford a private counsel.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.487
Mr. Thompson, allow me to say,

40:07.238 --> 40:10.533
"This is the most asinine, self-indulgent,

40:10.616 --> 40:13.786
time-wasting set of complaints
to cross this bench today.

40:13.869 --> 40:17.373
This court has murders
to deal with, gang wars,

40:17.456 --> 40:21.836
and if this entire matter isn't settled
by voluntary dismissal immediately,

40:21.919 --> 40:24.463
I'm holding you all on $100,000 bail

40:24.547 --> 40:26.715
and setting a hearing date
after the new year.

40:27.049 --> 40:30.302
You could do seven years of peace
on these charges.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.471
Mr. Thompson?

40:33.389 --> 40:34.849
Okay, okay, I quit.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.352
-Hell of a system of justice.
-What's that?

40:39.019 --> 40:41.439
I said it's a great system of justice.

40:42.064 --> 40:45.276
-Thank you. Dismissed. Next.
-(gavel thuds)

40:46.819 --> 40:50.281
MAN: Docket N639737. Lazaro Majana.

40:50.364 --> 40:53.868
Charged with murder on complaint
of detectives LaRue and Washington.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.456
Detective, you have statements
in this matter?

40:58.539 --> 40:59.832
Not at liberty, Your Honor.

40:59.915 --> 41:03.002
Ain't got nothing
but Jesus Martinez's pig lies!

41:03.085 --> 41:05.337
-(yelling)
-(clamoring)

41:07.631 --> 41:10.426
-Order in the court!
-(gavel banging)

41:10.509 --> 41:12.636
(clamoring continues)

41:14.263 --> 41:15.222
Get him out of here!

41:16.932 --> 41:19.935
Hold him till morning
and then bring him back! Manacle!

41:23.522 --> 41:25.149
Oh, boy.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.613
Ooh. That's a whole lot of zeros, Bobby.

41:30.696 --> 41:34.867
Yeah, but it's this number one
right over here that gets me.

41:34.950 --> 41:38.245
I'll tell you, my friend,
you don't find some fast shelters for it,

41:38.329 --> 41:41.582
Uncle Sam and the relatives
are gonna shrink that dude down to size.

41:41.957 --> 41:43.501
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.961
You acquainted with money markets?

41:46.045 --> 41:48.547
-You know, KEOs, IRAs...
-A little.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.926
...personal corp pensions,
income-earning investment credits--

41:52.009 --> 41:54.720
A little, a little, J.D.
What's on your mind?

41:54.803 --> 41:58.891
Oh, it's just I've been looking
into that a lot myself lately

41:58.974 --> 42:00.643
for my own investment strategies.

42:01.769 --> 42:05.898
I just want to say you want somebody
to kind of guide you through the rapids,

42:05.981 --> 42:07.816
hey, consider me a boat.

42:09.735 --> 42:10.819
Thanks. I will.

42:10.903 --> 42:13.155
Well, I'm there for you, you know.
I'm a source.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.699
Thanks, J.D.

42:17.326 --> 42:18.577
Only too happy to help.

42:20.746 --> 42:21.997
Thanks.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.043
Hey, my pleasure.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.421
-Bobby, can I talk to you for a second?
-What?

42:29.964 --> 42:33.175
I hate doing this, it's just,
I don't have nowhere else to--

42:33.259 --> 42:34.510
What's up, Perez?

42:34.885 --> 42:38.180
Okay, um, a few months ago,
my-my brother-in-law,

42:38.264 --> 42:41.976
he talks me into going into
this Cuban-Chinese restaurant.

42:42.059 --> 42:44.853
-Cuban-Chinese?
-Yeah, Cuban-Chinese.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.897
I don't know,
maybe it was the location, you know.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.649
And it didn't go, right?

42:48.732 --> 42:50.150
Well, I wanted to give it a chance

42:50.234 --> 42:53.654
and I started putting
house money into it--

42:53.737 --> 42:55.531
-Ouch.
-Yeah.

42:56.282 --> 43:00.953
So, uh, look, I need $1,500
in mortgage arrears...

43:01.579 --> 43:03.289
or I'm gonna lose my place, you know.

43:03.872 --> 43:06.250
I'll pay you back as fast as I can.
You know that, right?

43:06.333 --> 43:08.460
(sighs) Just let me think about it.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.713
Sure. Absolutely.

43:12.214 --> 43:13.340
You're not mad, are you?

43:14.133 --> 43:15.050
No.

43:15.926 --> 43:18.304
-Did I say something wrong?
-No.

43:18.387 --> 43:20.306
Just let me think about it, okay, Perez?

43:20.389 --> 43:22.766
Sure. Thanks.

43:24.643 --> 43:26.604
(telephone rings)

43:31.066 --> 43:34.528
Well, spank my monkey.
Don't you two little gals clean up good.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.323
I swear, if there wasn't two of you,
I never would have recognized you.

43:37.406 --> 43:38.699
-Thanks.
-Thanks a lot.

43:39.283 --> 43:42.077
You know, uh, after the day
like you've had today,

43:42.161 --> 43:43.829
I bet you're ready
for some serious relaxation.

43:43.912 --> 43:45.289
Am I right or am I wrong?

43:45.998 --> 43:49.335
As it so happens I'm without
social engagement myself this evening.

43:50.252 --> 43:52.671
-Ladies, you ready?
-BOTH: Hi.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.799
-You look lovely.
-BOTH: Thanks.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.301
Joseph, my brother.

43:57.384 --> 43:59.928
It looks like you're suffering
from a slight male deficiency here.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.181
It's okay, Andy. I got it covered.

44:07.436 --> 44:10.064
LUCY: I guess he thought you
were going to be a fifth wheel.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.900
RENKO: What's that?
He-he ain't got no fourth wheel.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.526
That one man.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.737
Ba-bing, ba-bing.

44:17.696 --> 44:19.073
Oh, ba-boy.

44:21.116 --> 44:24.036
Hey, since when's Coffey
been going out with the DeMarco sisters?

44:24.119 --> 44:26.163
Those are the Ba-bing sisters, J.D.

44:26.246 --> 44:28.332
(scoffs) Yeah, and I'm Pee Wee Reese.

44:28.415 --> 44:29.750
No, that's the DeMarco's.

44:29.833 --> 44:32.127
They used to taxi-dance this joint
over on the parkway.

44:32.211 --> 44:33.879
-You're kidding me.
-Oh, yeah.

44:33.962 --> 44:36.674
Hey, would you forget a face like those?

44:38.801 --> 44:41.136
MAN: It's okay. The bets
are down fellas, the bets are down.

44:41.220 --> 44:43.138
We're ready to close. Are we ready?

44:43.222 --> 44:45.224
Ready to roll. Here we go.

44:45.307 --> 44:46.600
-Roll 'em.
-Come on, baby, come on.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.018
Come on, baby. Six for me, baby.

44:48.102 --> 44:49.311
Come on. Six for me!

44:49.728 --> 44:51.897
-Damn!
-MAN: No six. Sevens.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.565
Got a new shooter, give me a new shooter.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.984
All right, place your bets.
Play the come, play the line.

44:56.068 --> 44:58.779
Here we go. All right,
you got your bets down, gentlemen.

44:58.862 --> 45:01.532
(overlapping chatter)

45:01.615 --> 45:03.117
Seven! Seven!

45:03.200 --> 45:05.994
Three. Crap. All right, same shooter.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.913
Place your bets, gentlemen,
place your bets.

45:07.996 --> 45:10.582
All right, let's get it down there.
We're ready to roll them.

45:10.666 --> 45:12.251
Okay, there you go. Roll them.

45:12.334 --> 45:13.961
Come on, man!

45:14.044 --> 45:15.796
Baby, come on, now! Uh!

45:16.422 --> 45:17.381
(groans)

45:27.057 --> 45:28.350
(sighs)

45:30.978 --> 45:32.312
Soon, Frank?

45:33.772 --> 45:34.648
What?

45:36.191 --> 45:37.526
When are you going to be done?

45:38.944 --> 45:39.862
Soon.

45:41.405 --> 45:42.406
What are you doing?

45:43.365 --> 45:44.867
Figuring out how much I'm worth.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.911
(laughs)

45:48.245 --> 45:49.705
Don't be crass.

45:52.207 --> 45:53.083
Yeah?

45:53.917 --> 45:57.463
As of 5:00 this afternoon
Bobby Hill could buy me three times over.

45:59.298 --> 46:01.008
(sighs) So what?

46:03.135 --> 46:05.304
So, I'd like $100,000, too.

46:07.473 --> 46:08.640
What would you do with it?

46:10.100 --> 46:12.311
A couple more days like today, Tahiti.

46:13.896 --> 46:14.855
You?

46:16.064 --> 46:17.232
No sale.

46:17.608 --> 46:18.567
Book the flight.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.110
(chuckles)

46:21.528 --> 46:23.155
We've got that much, you know...

46:25.657 --> 46:26.867
in my trust fund.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.830
You wanna know how much exactly?

46:33.248 --> 46:34.208
Sure.

46:36.251 --> 46:38.712
A hundred and seven thousand...

46:39.922 --> 46:40.881
and change.

46:42.841 --> 46:43.801
That's all?

46:45.010 --> 46:46.595
(laughs) That's all?

46:48.388 --> 46:49.765
I thought you were rich.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.351
(both chuckle)

46:53.060 --> 46:54.478
You gigolo.

46:57.105 --> 46:59.191
-Counselor.
-Uh-huh.

47:01.151 --> 47:02.903
We're rich beyond counting.

47:05.697 --> 47:08.075
(telephone rings)

47:08.158 --> 47:10.744
-(police siren wails)
-(helicopter whirring)

47:25.259 --> 47:26.927
HENRY: Little drive-by action, Frank.

47:27.010 --> 47:29.388
Lookin' for Diablos,
hit a nine-year-old kid.

47:30.681 --> 47:33.058
Hey, everybody makes mistakes.

47:33.141 --> 47:35.185
Any clue to the perpetrators?

47:36.436 --> 47:38.313
Montagues, Capulets.

47:38.397 --> 47:39.731
Stop it, Henry.

47:40.732 --> 47:42.568
Lot of good Jesus did us.

47:43.902 --> 47:45.612
We do what we can.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.739
When the bosses let us.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.367
(helicopter whirring)

47:52.411 --> 47:53.370
That was cheap.

47:54.413 --> 47:57.583
(sighs) I'll have the report
on your desk tomorrow morning.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.838
(police siren wailing)

48:11.680 --> 48:14.683
(closing theme playing)
