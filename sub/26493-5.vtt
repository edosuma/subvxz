00:00.030 --> 00:01.225
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:01.230 --> 00:02.594
-ASHER THE PORSCHE.
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO!

00:05.430 --> 00:06.932
IT AIN'T HARD TO SPOT
SOMEBODY WITH NO MONEY, MAN.

00:06.939 --> 00:08.738
I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO
CAN FIX THAT.

00:08.740 --> 00:10.265
THANK YOU, SPENCER.

00:10.270 --> 00:12.261
OLIVIA: IT WAS ONE
DRUG-INDUCED SCREW-UP.

00:12.270 --> 00:14.034
I LOST LEILA, AND I HAVE
TO LIVE WITH THAT GUILT

00:14.040 --> 00:15.439
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.477
COOP: MOM, LOOK AT ME.
I AM GAY.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.244
AND THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF
PRAYER THAT'S GONNA CHANGE THAT.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.775
IF YOU CANNOT
ABIDE BY OUR RULES,

00:20.780 --> 00:22.509
YOU CANNOT LIVE IN
THIS HOUSE.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.784
WELL, THEN I GUESS I DON'T
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.815
I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.879
MAYBE YOUR FATHER--

00:28.890 --> 00:30.528
I DON'T HAVE A FATHER...

00:30.530 --> 00:32.180
NOT ANYMORE.

00:32.189 --> 00:35.160
GRACE:
COREY LEFT A FEW YEARS BACK.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.197
HE WENT TO COACH
COLLEGE BALL IN NEVADA.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.862
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

00:39.870 --> 00:40.940
I THINK SPENCER'S
OUR BROTHER.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.260
WHAT?!

00:42.270 --> 00:43.806
DAD AND SPENCER'S MOM
USED TO DATE.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.107
HE ALSO DEPOSITED MONEY

00:45.110 --> 00:46.930
INTO A CRENSHAW
BANK ACCOUNT.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.305
HI. THIS IS LAURA BAKER.

00:48.310 --> 00:49.846
I'M CALLING ABOUT
A WIRE TRANSFER

00:49.850 --> 00:52.069
MADE TO YOUR BANK.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.362
YOU HAD TO BE MY
FIRST CALL.

01:12.370 --> 01:13.735
SO I'M WORKING
LATE TONIGHT,

01:13.740 --> 01:16.766
AND DYLAN HAS A
SLEEP-OVER WITH A FRIEND,

01:16.770 --> 01:18.329
BUT I PUT SOME
LEFTOVERS IN THE FRIDGE

01:18.340 --> 01:20.035
FOR YOU TO WARM UP
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.838
-LIKE...

01:21.840 --> 01:23.069
FOR REAL?

01:23.080 --> 01:24.206
SOMETHING WRONG, HONEY?

01:24.210 --> 01:27.043
OH, YEAH.
ONE MORE THING.

01:27.050 --> 01:30.020
BOTH: HAPPY BIRTHDAY

01:30.020 --> 01:32.239
ALL: TO YOU

01:32.250 --> 01:39.998
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU-OU

01:41.400 --> 01:43.061
GRACE: WE'LL ALL
BE HERE TODAY.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.367
HEY, THAT WAS COLD.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.225
DYLAN:
TELL HIM IT WAS MY IDEA!

01:46.230 --> 01:48.790
I'M SORRY, BABY.
THAT WAS ALL DYLAN.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.165
AND DON'T WORRY.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.831
IT'LL ONLY BE
A FAMILY DINNER,

01:51.840 --> 01:52.807
JUST HOW YOU LIKE IT.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.869
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.405
BUT I DO WISH I WAS EATING

01:56.410 --> 01:58.174
ONE OF THEM SWEET CORN
MUFFINS YOU ALWAYS MAKE

01:58.180 --> 01:59.818
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.811
CHECK YOUR BAG.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.242
WHAT?

02:09.090 --> 02:10.387
YO, HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

02:10.389 --> 02:12.825
I LOVE YOU TO
THE MOON AND BACK.

02:12.830 --> 02:16.698
AND WE'LL SEE YOU
TONIGHT.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.009
SPENCER: HEY,
GOOD MORNING.

02:30.010 --> 02:31.808
WHAT?

02:31.810 --> 02:33.278
I WAS JUST

02:33.280 --> 02:34.679
[MUSIC PLAYING
THROUGH HEADPHONES]

02:34.680 --> 02:35.818
HI.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.481
YOU GOOD?

02:38.490 --> 02:40.083
WHY? DID JORDAN
SAY SOMETHING?

02:40.090 --> 02:43.287
-NOTHING.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.725
YOU'RE GETTING CRUMBS
ON THE FLOOR.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.625
SORRY.

02:51.030 --> 02:53.032
HEY, SOMETHING WRONG
WITH OLIVIA?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.269
WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU?

02:54.270 --> 02:56.932
NOTHING. SHE JUST
ACTING STRANGE,

02:56.940 --> 02:59.739
LOOKING AT ME LIKE--

02:59.740 --> 03:02.038

03:02.040 --> 03:03.599

03:03.610 --> 03:05.271
DID YOU GET SOME
PANCAKES, SPENCER?

03:05.280 --> 03:06.418
NO, MA'AM. I ALREADY ATE.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.115
MOM'S HOMEMADE CORN MUFFINS.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.747
MMM. LET ME GET SOME

03:09.750 --> 03:11.741
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. YOU

03:11.750 --> 03:14.060
LOOK, MOMS ONLY MAKES
THESE ONCE A YEAR.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.653
I CAN'T BE GIVING
THEM AWAY.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.879
LAURA:
WAIT. SPENCER, IS TODAY...?

03:17.890 --> 03:18.982
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.094
REALLY?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.693
-WE HAVE TI&IDOCELEBRATE!

03:21.700 --> 03:24.169
-SPENCER'S BIRTHDAY. HEY, MAMA.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.626
LAURA: WAIT. YOU
KNEW ABOUT IT, TOO?

03:25.630 --> 03:27.962
OF COURSE I KNEW. I DID
HIS TRANSFER PAPERS.

03:27.970 --> 03:29.563
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, B.

03:29.570 --> 03:30.969
-THANK YOU, COACH.
-ALL RIGHT.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.165
WELL,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.672
WHO SHOULD WE
INVITE?

03:33.680 --> 03:35.330
THANK YOU, BUT I'M ALREADY
HAVING DINNER

03:35.340 --> 03:36.978
AT MY HOUSE TONIGHT. THANKS.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.301
OK. WE'LL DO IT
TOMORROW.

03:39.310 --> 03:41.711
I REALLY DON'T NEED
A PARTY, MRS. BAKER.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.313
IT'S NOT
GONNA BE A PARTY.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.879
IT'LL BE MORE OF, LIKE,
A LUNCH-TYPE THING.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.016
WE'LL JUST...

03:46.020 --> 03:47.419
WE'LL JUST INVITE
A FEW PEOPLE.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.013
LISTEN, MAN, BIRTHDAYS
ARE HER THING, SO...

03:49.020 --> 03:50.385
THERE'S REALLY
NO USE RESISTING.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.427
LAURA: IT WON'T
REALLY BE A PARTY.

03:52.430 --> 03:54.922
-BYE, MOM.
-GOOD-BYE.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.030
THERE'S A RUMOR
GOING AROUND.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.008
IT'S JUST A BIRTHDAY.

04:08.010 --> 04:09.080
WELL,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,

04:09.080 --> 04:10.445
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE RUMOR.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.009
APPARENTLY, YOU'RE
THE GUY TO CALL

04:12.010 --> 04:13.444
IF I NEED SOMETHING
FIXED.

04:13.450 --> 04:15.214
THANKS FOR HELPING
ASHER WITH THE CAR.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.211
IT WAS COOL OF YOU,
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE

04:17.220 --> 04:19.017
WASN'T THE MOST
WELCOMING STUDENT

04:19.019 --> 04:20.317
AT BEVERLY.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.856
WE'RE COOL NOW.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.009
WELL, I'M GLAD.

04:23.020 --> 04:25.022
AND HE TOLD ME
THE TRUTH ABOUT

04:25.030 --> 04:28.398
HIS DAD AND LOSING
THEIR MONEY.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.220
SO YOU ALL TWO ARE GOOD?

04:30.230 --> 04:31.959
UH, YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.165
IT DOESN'T MATTER
TO ME

04:33.170 --> 04:34.490
HOW MUCH MONEY
SOMEONE HAS.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.936
SO WE'LL BOTH BE
THERE TOMORROW.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.339
TOMORROW?

04:39.340 --> 04:41.229
YEAH. MRS. BAKER SENT
AN EVITE.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.550
I TOLD HER I DIDN'T
WANT A PARTY.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.769
WELL, THE EVITE
SPECIFICALLY SAID

04:45.780 --> 04:48.420
IT WASN'T A PARTY,
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

04:48.420 --> 04:50.889
MAN, THAT WOMAN CAN'T TAKE
"NO" FOR AN ANSWER.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.619
WELL, WHEN CAN I GIVE
YOU MY GIFT?

04:52.620 --> 04:54.452
WHAT? YOU AIN'T GOT TO
BUY ME NOTHING.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.586
NO. I DIDN'T BUY IT.

04:55.590 --> 04:57.126
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
1 HAD,

04:57.130 --> 04:59.053
AND NOW I WANT YOU
TO HAVE IT.

04:59.060 --> 05:01.051
SO HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

05:01.060 --> 05:03.051
I GOT A DINNER AT HOME.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.425
OK. SO AFTER.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.263
I DON'T TAKE "NO"
FOR AN ANSWER EITHER.

05:07.270 --> 05:08.931
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.408
OK.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.572
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO BE JEALOUS

05:15.580 --> 05:17.002
OF LEILA TALKING TO YOUR
BROTHER, RIGHT?

05:17.010 --> 05:18.899
I'M NOT JEALOUS. AND
STOP CALLING HIM THAT!

05:18.910 --> 05:21.447
OK. HOW ARE YOU STILL
DENYING IT?

05:21.450 --> 05:23.441
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
CALLED THE BANK, OLIVIA.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.748
DAD'S BEEN MAKING MONTHLY
PAYMENTS FOR 17 YEARS.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.809
BY THE WAY, HOW OLD IS
SPENCER TODAY?

05:27.820 --> 05:29.811
IT DOESN'T PROVE
ANYTHING.

05:29.820 --> 05:32.130
OK. SO LET'S FIND OUT
WHO THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS

05:32.130 --> 05:33.996
ARE GOING TO, THEN.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.899
-NO.
-OLIVIA--

05:34.900 --> 05:36.459
HAVE YOU EVER ONCE
THOUGHT ABOUT

05:36.460 --> 05:37.962
WHAT HAPPENS IF
IT'S TRUE,

05:37.970 --> 05:40.769
NOT JUST TO US BUT
TO SPENCER, TO MOM?

05:40.770 --> 05:42.499
OUR LIFE AS WE KNOW
IT WOULD BE OVER,

05:42.500 --> 05:44.662
AND IT'S A STONE
WE CAN'T UNTURN.

05:44.670 --> 05:47.605
OK. OH, LISTEN, YOU MIGHT
BE OK BURYING PROBLEMS...

05:47.610 --> 05:50.250
-HMM.
-...BUT I'M NOT.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.140
HEY, STUD.

05:53.150 --> 05:54.618
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.349
THE ANSWER'S NO, JORDAN.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.944
SOME SECRETS ARE BETTER
LEFT ALONE.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.140
BILLY. I WAS ABOUT
TO CALL YOU.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.199
OH. ABOUT WHAT?

06:16.200 --> 06:19.807
OH. HI, LAURA.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE--

06:19.810 --> 06:23.030
MY HUSBAND?
NO, IT'S JUST ME. I'M SORRY.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.577
YEAH. I--1 JUST WANTED
TO REMIND BILLY

06:25.580 --> 06:27.469
THAT TODAY WAS
SPENCER'S BIRTHDAY.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.642
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.017
UM, I WAS THINKING ABOUT HAVING
A FEW PEOPLE OVER TOMORROW

06:32.020 --> 06:33.954
FOR SPENCER'S BIG DAY.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.055
AND I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT
YOU AND DYLAN CAN MAKE IT.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.585
SPENCER AGREED TO THAT?

06:38.590 --> 06:40.957
WELL, HE SAID HE DIDN'T
WANT A PARTY.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.520
SO WHAT ARE YOU
INVITING US TO?

06:43.530 --> 06:46.067
MORE LIKE A SMALL
GATHERING OF FRIENDS.

06:46.070 --> 06:47.538
HOW IS THAT NOT A PARTY?

06:47.540 --> 06:49.099
IT'S A GRAY AREA.

06:49.100 --> 06:53.162
JUST PLEASE SAY THAT YOU AND
DYLAN CAN MAKE IT TOMORROW.

06:53.170 --> 06:54.331
SPENCER:
YOU SAID YES?

06:54.340 --> 06:55.375
SHE'S VERY CONVINCING.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.178
SHE'S A LAWYER.

06:57.180 --> 06:58.341
SHE SAID IT'S NOT A PARTY.

06:58.350 --> 06:59.602
EXPLAIN THAT.

06:59.610 --> 07:03.410
APPARENTLY,
THERE'S A GRAY AREA.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.216
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE
A LAWYER.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.609
DYLAN: HAPPY BIRTHDAY--

07:09.620 --> 07:11.224
COOP: HEY, HEY.
COME ON, MAN.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.379
WE ALREADY SUNG THAT SONG.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.528
I ONLY GET
ONE SONG?

07:13.530 --> 07:16.227

ONE WISH.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.925
BLOW THEM OUT.

07:17.930 --> 07:21.059

07:21.070 --> 07:23.710
I'M FEELING ALIVE,

07:23.710 --> 07:26.634
I'M FEELING ALIVE

07:26.640 --> 07:28.574
I'M FEELING ALIVE,
ALIVE, ALIVE

07:28.580 --> 07:30.446
IF YOU FEEL WHAT I'M

07:30.450 --> 07:33.420
DIFFERENT MAN: COME IN!

07:33.420 --> 07:35.616

07:35.620 --> 07:38.419
-HEY, THANKS, MA.
-OH, YOU'RE WELCOME, BABY.

07:38.420 --> 07:41.219
FIRST MAN: IF YOU FEEL

GIVE ME MY DAMN HAT.

07:42.390 --> 07:44.028
SECOND MAN: COME HERE!

07:48.230 --> 07:50.062
HEY, COOP. WAIT UP.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.890
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO THANK YOU

07:51.900 --> 07:53.220
FOR HELPING OUT
WITH ASHER'S CAR.

07:53.230 --> 07:54.834
IT'S ALL GOOD, MAN.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.490
I AIN'T DOING NOTHING.
I JUST MADE A CALL.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.264
I AIN'T GOT TO LIKE HIM.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.500
SHAWN REALLY
CAME THROUGH.

08:00.510 --> 08:02.274
SO MAYBE HE DOES GOT
YOUR BACK,

08:02.280 --> 08:04.248
BUT HE AIN'T ME,
ALL RIGHT?

08:04.250 --> 08:06.173
HE ALWAYS GONNA WANT
SOMETHING.

08:08.550 --> 08:11.747
WOMAN: INTOXICATE ME, BABY

08:11.750 --> 08:15.015
DON'T TRY TO HIDE FROM ME

08:16.760 --> 08:18.387
WHO DON'T WE
EVER GO OUT?

08:18.390 --> 08:20.893
I'D RATHER BE
DOING THIS.

08:20.900 --> 08:25.189
WHY? ARE YOU EMBARRASSED
OF ME OR SOMETHING?

08:25.200 --> 08:26.565
'CAUSE I WANT TO GO OUT,

08:26.570 --> 08:28.299
BUT--I DON'T KNOW--YOU

08:41.520 --> 08:43.443
OK. SO THEN LET'S GO OUT.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.794
WOMAN: SO WE ALREADY
OFF THE GROUND...

09:02.800 --> 09:06.134
ALL RIGHT.
SO I'M GONNA GO.

09:06.140 --> 09:09.678
SO WE ALREADY
OFF THE GROUND...

09:09.680 --> 09:13.344
LEILA: THE ROSE BOWL,
HOME OF THE UCLA BRUINS.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.216
MAN, THIS PLACE IS--

09:15.220 --> 09:16.312
HISTORIC.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.516
HOW DID YOU HOOK
THIS UP?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.682
UM, MY DAD DONATED
THE LOCKER ROOM,

09:20.690 --> 09:22.988
SO THAT COMES WITH PERKS.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.321
LOOK AT ALL THESE
SEATS!

09:26.330 --> 09:28.822
90,000.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.328
PSH. YO, THIS DON'T
EVEN SEEM REAL.

09:33.330 --> 09:34.491
HA HA!

09:34.500 --> 09:35.695
WELL, IMAGINE
WHEN THEY'RE

09:35.700 --> 09:37.168
ALL CHEERING
FOR YOU ONE DAY

09:37.170 --> 09:40.333
OR BOOING, IF YOU'RE
PLAYING FOR USC.

09:41.610 --> 09:43.840
HEY, I'M COOL WITH THAT...

09:45.280 --> 09:46.543
AS LONG AS I'M HERE.

09:46.550 --> 09:48.416
YOU WILL BE.

10:06.030 --> 10:08.567
THIS IS THE BEST PRESENT
I EVER GOT.

10:08.570 --> 10:10.265
OH. THIS ISN'T
YOUR PRESENT.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.204
I JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS
THE BEST PLACE

10:12.210 --> 10:13.359
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

10:13.370 --> 10:14.701
WHAT?

10:14.710 --> 10:16.576
VIP FIELD PASSES TO
TOMORROW'S GAME.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.378
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S A NIGHT GAME,

10:18.380 --> 10:19.848
SO YOU COULD COME

10:19.850 --> 10:22.239
AFTER YOUR NON-PARTY
THING AT THE BAKERS'.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.582
-THIS IS TOO MUCH, LEILA.
-NO, IT'S NOT.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.685
UM, THE PASSES CAME
WITH THE LOCKER ROOM,

10:27.690 --> 10:30.284
SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

10:32.290 --> 10:33.451
WHO THEY PLAYING?

10:33.460 --> 10:35.326
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.198
EASTERN NEVADA.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.464
OH, DID I GET YOU
TICKETS FOR A BAD GAME?

10:41.470 --> 10:45.168
HE'LL BE ON THIS FIELD
TOMORROW.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.400
WHO?

10:47.410 --> 10:49.071
MY DAD.

10:51.950 --> 10:55.341
HE'S THE LINEBACKER COACH
FOR EASTERN NEVADA.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.817
I AIN'T SEEN HIM IN 6 YEARS.

11:02.790 --> 11:06.727
WELL, MAYBE
NOW IT'S TIME.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.477
ANOTHER SET.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.744
WOW.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.218
YOU KNOW THERE'S
A DIFFERENCE

11:28.220 --> 11:31.645
BETWEEN WORKING OUT
AND WORKING IT OUT?

11:31.650 --> 11:33.687
SOMETHING YOU NEED
TO TALK ABOUT?

11:33.690 --> 11:36.955
UCLA'S PLAYING
EASTERN NEVADA TONIGHT.

11:41.430 --> 11:43.296
YOUR POPS IS IN TOWN.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.130
-NAH.

11:48.140 --> 11:51.269
AIN'T LIKE IT'S THE FIRST
TIME HE CAME TO TOWN, RIGHT?

11:51.270 --> 11:54.205
HE SAID HE HAD TO LEAVE
TO TAKE THIS JOB,

11:54.210 --> 11:57.407
BUT YOU WOULDN'T ABANDON
YOUR FAMILY LIKE THAT.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.542
YOU KNOW WHAT
HE USED TO TELL ME?

12:01.550 --> 12:05.487
ONE DAY I'll BE OUT
ON THAT FIELD.

12:05.490 --> 12:07.788
AND NOW THAT I'M GETTING
CLOSER TO MY DREAM,

12:07.790 --> 12:11.385
HE DON'T EVEN KNOW.

12:13.860 --> 12:16.500
BUT TONIGHT I GOT
FIELD PASSES.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.491
I CAN WALK RIGHT UP
TO HIM.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.524
AND SAY WHAT?

12:19.530 --> 12:20.634
THAT I'M DOING IT.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.438
EVERYTHING WE
TALKED ABOUT--

12:22.440 --> 12:24.329
OUR DREAM.

12:26.340 --> 12:30.231
I'M DOING IT ALL NOW
WITHOUT HIS HELP.

12:45.890 --> 12:50.521
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO MY
FATHER IN YEARS.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.726
IT'S NOT LIKE HE LEFT ME
BEHIND OR ANYTHING,

12:52.730 --> 12:55.734
BUT, UM, HE DECIDED

12:55.740 --> 12:59.040
THAT I WASN'T THE SON
THAT HE WANTED.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.908
THE SAME THOUGHTS YOU'RE
HAVING RIGHT NOW,

13:02.910 --> 13:04.901
IT'S BEST TO FIND
WHAT YOU NEED

13:04.910 --> 13:08.540
IN THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE THERE FOR YOU,

13:08.550 --> 13:11.190
NOT THE ONES WHO
LET YOU DOWN.

13:13.420 --> 13:14.581
SOME WELLS...

13:14.590 --> 13:19.926
THEY JUST--THEY RUN DRY.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.261
ALL RIGHT?

13:36.410 --> 13:39.971
HOW MANY OF THOSE
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE?

13:39.980 --> 13:41.470
YOU JUST KNOW WHEN
YOU SEE IT.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.574
OK, COME ON. LET'S GO.
WE GOT TO GET READY.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.389
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY...

13:45.390 --> 13:46.789
MM

13:46.790 --> 13:49.589
WE DITCH THIS PARTY
TONIGHT,

13:49.590 --> 13:51.126
WE STAY IN--

13:51.130 --> 13:57.194
JUST YOU AND ME HERE
ALONE ALL WEEKEND?

13:57.200 --> 14:01.034
MM. WELL, MY DAD COMES
IN TOMORROW.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.838
AND I'M SURE HE'LL WANT
TO SQUEEZE IN

14:02.840 --> 14:04.604
AS MUCH FATHER-DAUGHTER
TIME AS HE CAN

14:04.610 --> 14:06.100
BEFORE LEAVING.

14:06.110 --> 14:08.499
YOU KNOW HOW HE'S BEEN
SINCE MY MOM DIED.

14:08.510 --> 14:10.547
AND, BESIDES, YOU
WOULDN'T REALLY WANT

14:10.550 --> 14:13.042
TO SKIP SPENCER'S PARTY
AFTER HE HELPED

14:13.050 --> 14:15.269
WITH THE CAR, WOULD YOU?

14:17.120 --> 14:18.849
HOW LONG WE GONNA
BRING THAT UP?

14:18.850 --> 14:21.319
IT LITERALLY JUST HAPPENED.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.285
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.429
IT'S GONNA BE KIND OF
WEIRD HANGING AROUND

14:27.430 --> 14:28.295
SPENCER RIGHT NOW...

14:28.300 --> 14:30.621
HIM KNOWING THE TRUTH
ABOUT ME.

14:30.630 --> 14:32.120
I KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU.

14:32.130 --> 14:33.768
IS IT WEIRD HANGING
AROUND ME?

14:33.770 --> 14:35.499
YEAH, A LITTLE.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.059
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA
KEEP DOING THIS?

14:37.070 --> 14:38.663
HOW LONG AM I GONNA LIE?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.479
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.709
I DON'T KNOW, LEILA.

14:41.710 --> 14:45.647
I DIDN'T MARK
A "COME CLEAN" DAY

14:45.650 --> 14:47.140
IN MY CALENDAR.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.675
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO PARTICIPATE

14:48.680 --> 14:50.512
IN THE EMBELLISHMENTS.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.487
DON'T WORRY.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.980
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
YOU LIE FOR ME.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.186
HEY, NO.
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

14:55.190 --> 14:58.956
I NEED YOU TO FIGURE OUT
WHO YOU'RE GONNA BE.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.294
ME, I LOVE YOU FOR YOU,
MONEY OR NOT.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.689
BUT, HEY, IF THIS IS
GONNA WORK,

15:04.700 --> 15:07.567
I NEED YOU TO FEEL THE
SAME WAY ABOUT YOURSELF.

15:07.570 --> 15:10.096
THINK YOU CAN DO THAT?

15:17.580 --> 15:19.048
MAN: YOU

15:19.050 --> 15:22.179
WHY DON'T YOU
COME ON OVER HERE...

15:23.580 --> 15:24.718
HEY.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.812
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

15:25.820 --> 15:28.016
I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE

15:28.020 --> 15:31.388
FOR ACTING SO STRANGE
YESTERDAY.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.859
WE GOOD.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.225
I'M KIND OF BUSY
HERE, THOUGH.

15:36.230 --> 15:40.189
OK! NOW YOU'RE THE ONE
ACTING STRANGE.

15:42.570 --> 15:44.402
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

15:44.410 --> 15:46.162
IT'S NOT YOU.

15:46.170 --> 15:49.333
LEILA GOT ME TICKETS TO THE
UCLA-EASTERN NEVADA GAME TONIGHT.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.978
NICE GIFT.

15:50.980 --> 15:53.278
YEAH. I'M NOT GONNA
GO, THOUGH.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.509
WHY NOT?

15:54.520 --> 15:56.409
BECAUSE MY DAD IS THE
COACH FOR EASTERN NEVADA.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.218
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE HIM.

15:58.220 --> 16:01.315
HE OBVIOUSLY
DON'T WANT TO SEE ME.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.049
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

16:03.060 --> 16:06.121
MAYBE HE'S JUST AFRAID
OF HOW YOU'LL REACT.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.758
YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT.
HE'S THE ONE WHO LEFT.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.398
I GOT TO FOCUS ON
THE PEOPLE

16:10.400 --> 16:11.492
WHO HAVE BEEN THERE
FOR ME.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.025
WAIT. MY DAD
TOLD YOU NOT TO GO?

16:13.030 --> 16:15.237
HE'S JUST SPEAKING
THE TRUTH, RIGHT?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.309
I HAVE AN ADDRESS.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.412
WHAT?

16:31.420 --> 16:33.411
I HAVE A CRENSHAW
HOME ADDRESS

16:33.420 --> 16:35.354
FOR THE WIRE
TRANSFER.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.010
IS IT SPENCER'S HOME?

16:37.020 --> 16:38.920
NO. BUT THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANTED.

16:38.930 --> 16:41.092
NOW, LET'S GO GET
SOME ANSWERS.

16:44.030 --> 16:46.920
MAN: CAN'T STAND BROKEN
PROMISES

16:46.930 --> 16:48.432
KEEP IT REAL
WITH HER BROTHER

16:48.440 --> 16:49.498
KEEP IT REAL IF YOU

16:49.500 --> 16:50.865
CAN

16:50.870 --> 16:52.861
WE ALL HEARD
BROKEN PROMISES

16:52.870 --> 16:54.474
I KEPT IT REAL WITH
YOU, SHORTY

16:54.480 --> 16:55.470
KEPT IT REAL WITH YOU...

16:55.480 --> 16:57.073
THIS IS IT. STOP.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.777
MAN: MAN, CAN'T STAND
BROKEN PROMISES...

17:02.750 --> 17:04.945
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A BOX OF CANDY?

17:04.950 --> 17:06.987
WE NEED A REASON TO
KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

17:06.990 --> 17:08.719
SO YOUR BIG PLAN IS
TO PRETEND

17:08.720 --> 17:10.118
YOU'RE AN 8 YEAR OLD?

17:10.119 --> 17:12.521
MAN: YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN? HIS DRIVE.

17:12.530 --> 17:14.657
LeBRON, THE BEST
LAKER EVER.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.152
KAREEM SHAQ

17:17.160 --> 17:19.219
NAH! KING JAMES WILL
SMOKE 'EM ALL.

17:19.230 --> 17:20.391
HI.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.334
AIN'T YOU A LITTLE OLD
TO BE SELLING CANDY?

17:22.339 --> 17:25.731
WHAT YOU GOT IN THERE,
ANY WITH PEANUTS?

17:25.740 --> 17:28.778
UM, IT'S
AN ASSORTMENT.

17:29.810 --> 17:31.346
IS THIS YOUR HOUSE?

17:31.350 --> 17:32.374
NAH, THIS WILLIE'S CRIB.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.678
OLIVIA: HOW LONG HAVE
YOU LIVED HERE?

17:34.680 --> 17:38.412
SINCE YOUR DADDY WAS BORN.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.986
YOU KNOW THEM?

17:43.720 --> 17:45.620
THESE HERE ARE
MY GRANDKIDS.

17:45.630 --> 17:48.554
MAN: HA HA!

17:48.560 --> 17:50.767
YOU ALL GIVE
A FAMILY DISCOUNT?

18:00.010 --> 18:01.535
I MUST BE, LIKE,
10 YEARS OLD HERE, YEAH?

18:01.540 --> 18:04.043
GUESS YOU GAVE UP
SOCCER FOR FOOTBALL.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.870
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
YOUR STATS.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.212
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD
THIS YEAR.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.779
JORDAN: I APPRECIATE IT.

18:09.780 --> 18:12.215
I'M CRINGING.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.860
I CAN'T BELIEVE MOM
STILL USED THIS PHOTO.

18:14.860 --> 18:15.918
STILL DANCING?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.854
NO, NOT FOR A WHILE.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.227
-NO. HA HA!

18:20.230 --> 18:22.358
JORDAN: OLIVIA,
LET ME SEE THAT.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.467
OLIVIA: I FORGOT
I EVEN DANCED.

18:26.470 --> 18:31.237
SO WHY NOW AFTER
ALL THESE YEARS?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.561
I'VE BEEN RIGHT HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.505
WE, UH, WE JUST DIDN'T
KNOW YOU LIVED HERE.

18:36.510 --> 18:37.602
SO...

18:37.610 --> 18:40.409
BILLY'S BEEN KEEPING
HIS POOR OLD MAN A SECRET.

18:40.410 --> 18:45.246
HUH. I GUESS THAT MEANS HE
DON'T KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

18:46.420 --> 18:51.187
HE TOLD US YOU MOVED
TO ARIZONA.

18:51.190 --> 18:55.821
BUT SO WHY DON'T YOU TWO
TALK ANYMORE?

18:57.160 --> 18:59.094
MONEY CHANGES YOU,

18:59.100 --> 19:00.966
EVEN MY BOY.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.938
ONE DAY HE
JUST FORGOT

19:02.940 --> 19:04.362
WHERE HE CAME FROM

19:04.370 --> 19:06.031
BUT YOU'RE ACCEPTING
HIS MONEY.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.099
-JORDAN!
-THAT'S--THAT'S OK.

19:08.110 --> 19:09.874
HE'S RIGHT.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.974
I RAISED BILLY,

19:11.980 --> 19:13.607
PUSHED HIM
REAL HARD TO BE

19:13.610 --> 19:16.079
THE BEST FOOTBALL
PLAYER HE COULD BE.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.219
HE WON'T ADMIT IT,

19:18.220 --> 19:20.416
BUT HE MADE IT INTO
THE NFL BECAUSE OF ME.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.980
SO IF HE WANTS TO SEND
ME A THANK-YOU CHECK

19:22.990 --> 19:25.857
ONCE A MONTH,
I'M CASHING IT.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.453
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT

19:27.460 --> 19:31.294
MY BOY LEFT HOME
AND NEVER CAME BACK.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.840
OLIVIA: MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T FEEL WELCOME.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.104
DID HE SAY THAT?

19:38.110 --> 19:41.808
NO, BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

19:43.510 --> 19:45.478
WE SHOULD, UM, WE SHOULD
GET OUT OF HERE, OLIVIA.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.973
YEAH. WE HAVE A
BIRTHDAY PARTY AT OUR HOUSE.

19:48.980 --> 19:53.110
BUT...BUT...WE, UM,

19:53.120 --> 19:54.952
WE WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.885
ANYTIME YOU WANT TO
SHOW UP ON MY DOORSTEP,

19:58.890 --> 20:00.790
I'll BE HERE.

20:04.330 --> 20:06.469
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF YOU
CAME TO THE PARTY TODAY

20:06.470 --> 20:09.167
AND TRIED TO TALK
TO HIM?

20:09.170 --> 20:13.004
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA, KIDDO.

20:13.010 --> 20:15.308
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.774
YEAH. WE SHOULD
JUST GET HOME.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.919
-BYE.
-BYE.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.355
MAN: I WISH I HAD
THIS FEELING EVERY DAY

20:32.360 --> 20:35.455
AND I GUESS THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY IN

20:35.460 --> 20:37.497
BUT EVERY DAY, IT
FEEL LIKE SUMMER

20:37.500 --> 20:39.821
AND WHEN THEY TELL ME
"GROW UP," I DON'T WANT TO

20:39.830 --> 20:44.233
THIS IS THAT GOOD VIBE
WE ALWAYS DREAM OF...

20:44.240 --> 20:46.800
SO MUCH FOR
A SMALL GATHERING.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.302
COOP: THEY NEED YOU TO OPEN
AND SHUT THE DOOR ALL DAY?

20:49.310 --> 20:50.573
DIFFERENT MAN:
IT'S TO FEEL GOOD

20:50.580 --> 20:52.503
SOMETHING YOU
CAN HOLD ONTO

20:52.510 --> 20:54.740
I GOT YOU POPPING INTO
SOMETHING YOU AIN'T USED TO

20:54.750 --> 20:58.015
SPENCER: PLEASE TELL ME Y'ALL
CAME TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM ALL THIS.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.749
HA HA!

20:59.750 --> 21:01.582
GRACE: MORE LIKE, GET
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

21:01.590 --> 21:03.217
DYLAN: MAN, SPENCER'S SO LUCKY.
SPENCER: HEY, SHUT UP.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.221
WHAT'S UP

21:08.060 --> 21:09.824
DYLAN: SO WHERE DO YOU SLEEP?

21:09.830 --> 21:14.028
UPSTAIRS, FIFTH ROOM ON
THE RIGHT. GO CHECK IT OUT.

21:14.030 --> 21:15.338
FIFTH ROOM ON THE RIGHT?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.762
I KNOW. IT TAKES
SOME GETTING USED TO.

21:16.770 --> 21:19.239
I DON'T THINK I WANT
YOU USED TO THAT.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.038
LOOK, I'll TAKE MY BED
AT CRENSHAW

21:21.040 --> 21:22.269
OVER THIS PLACE ANY DAY.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.203
THAT'S MY BOY.

21:24.210 --> 21:25.746
MAN: LOOK OVER
OUR PLAYLIST

21:25.750 --> 21:27.878
EVERYBODY FEEL THIS?,
THE CROWD GO CRAZY...

21:27.880 --> 21:29.712
WHERE SHOULD I PUT
MY MAC AND CHEESE?

21:29.720 --> 21:34.954
UH, MAYBE OVER BY THE
MAC AND CHEESE TRUCK.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.427
OH, COME ON!

21:39.430 --> 21:41.728
HEY, YOU SAID YES
TO THIS, ALL RIGHT?

21:44.370 --> 21:46.395
-T'LL EAT IT.
-UH-HUH.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.038
WHO SAYS YOU COULDN'T SIT?

21:49.040 --> 21:50.667
I KNOW YOU'RE GETTING
TIRED OF STANDING THERE.

21:50.670 --> 21:52.638
UH, DID YOU MAKE
A WRONG TURN?

21:52.640 --> 21:56.076
I SEE WHAT YOU
DID THERE. OK. OK.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.878
-YO, OLIVIA.
-UH-HUH.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.507
YOU GOT A SICK CRIB,
BY THE WAY.

21:59.510 --> 22:01.148
THANK YOU. THE BACKYARD'S
THE BEST PART.

22:01.150 --> 22:02.845
I'M GONNA CHECK
THAT OUT,

22:02.850 --> 22:04.784
BUT CAN YOU TELL
THAT LADY SHE CAN SIT?

22:04.790 --> 22:07.851
-YOU CAN SIT.
-HEY, COME ON. LET'S GO.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.121
WHAT?!

22:12.130 --> 22:13.825
WE GONNA TALK ABOUT GW?

22:13.830 --> 22:15.093
WHO?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.397
GRANDPA WILLIE.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.323
WE'VE KNOWN HIM FOR AN HOUR.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.594
YOU CAN'T USE
AN ABBREVIATION ALREADY.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.193
OK, I WONDER IF HE KNOWS
ABOUT SPENCER, THOUGH.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.510
ARE YOU

22:24.510 --> 22:26.103
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

22:26.110 --> 22:27.464
SPENCER IS NOT OUR BROTHER.

22:27.470 --> 22:29.472
AND THE FACT THAT GW WAS
AT THE ADDRESS

22:29.480 --> 22:31.141
DISPROVES YOUR
ENTIRE THEORY.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.902
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

22:32.910 --> 22:35.117
EITHER WAY, DAD'S STILL LYING
ABOUT HIS HISTORY WITH GRACE,

22:35.120 --> 22:36.918
AND WE HAVE
TO FIND OUT WHY.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.149
NO, WE DON'T.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.481
MAN: AND NOW IT'S
UP TO YOU, COME ON

22:39.490 --> 22:41.788
WE GOING ALL NIGHT...

22:41.790 --> 22:46.455
SO ASHER WAS ALL,
"NO! PLEASE! NO!"

22:46.460 --> 22:49.122
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING A BIT.

22:49.130 --> 22:50.620
IT WAS CRAZY.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.668
THE CAR JUST KEPT ROLLING
RIGHT OUT INTO THE STREET.

22:53.670 --> 22:55.866
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU FORGOT
TO PUT THE PARKING BRAKE ON.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.565
ALL RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

22:57.570 --> 22:59.129
WHY ARE WE EVEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS? IT'S FIXED.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.460
MOVE ON.

23:00.470 --> 23:02.131
JJ: WHERE'D YOU TAKE IT?

23:02.140 --> 23:03.232
I KNOW A GUY.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.776
<i>33: YOU KNOW A GUY
WHO CAN FIX</i>

23:04.780 --> 23:09.320
A 1959 PORSCHE ROADSTER
IN ONE DAY?

23:09.320 --> 23:11.914
I DON'T SEE IT.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.149
ONE DAY, DUDE?

23:13.150 --> 23:18.020
HEY. MONEY TALKS, BOYS.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.385
I WHIPPED OUT MY DAD'S
BLACK CARD. BOOM.

23:20.390 --> 23:22.927
NEXT DAY, GOOD AS NEW.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.460
SO HOW COME YOU AIN'T
BRING YOUR GIRL?

23:31.470 --> 23:34.064
I DON'T KNOW.

23:34.070 --> 23:35.299
YEAH, YOU DO.

23:35.310 --> 23:37.176
WHAT, YOU THINK 'CAUSE YOU
MOVED TO BEVERLY HILLS,

23:37.180 --> 23:38.477
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING NOW?

23:38.480 --> 23:40.175
NO. I'M JUST SAYING,
ALL RIGHT?

23:40.180 --> 23:41.511
YOU LIKE HER.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.976
WE BOTH KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HOLDING BACK.

23:42.980 --> 23:44.516
YOU AND ME, WE GOT
TO STOP WORRYING

23:44.520 --> 23:46.682
ABOUT THE PARENTS
WHO REJECTED US, MAN.

23:46.690 --> 23:49.910
THIS ABOUT YOUR DAD
BEING HERE?

23:49.920 --> 23:51.922
YEAH. HA HA.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.900
RIGHT? YOU AIN'T THE ONLY ONE
THAT KNOWS SOME THINGS, OK?

23:54.900 --> 23:57.551
HA HA.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.097
YOU KNOW I GOT TICKETS?

24:00.100 --> 24:01.192
YOU GONNA GO?

24:01.200 --> 24:03.396
NAH.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.562
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, BUT...

24:05.570 --> 24:07.060
BECAUSE YOU GOT TO
ROLL WITH THE PEOPLE

24:07.070 --> 24:09.209
WHO ALWAYS BEEN
THERE FOR YOU, RIGHT,

24:09.210 --> 24:11.406
WHO ALWAYS ACCEPT
YOU FOR YOU?

24:21.420 --> 24:23.855
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:28.430 --> 24:31.070
MY GRANDKIDS INVITED ME.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.738
YOU INVITED HIM HERE?

24:36.740 --> 24:38.560
HOW IS IT THAT YOU'RE MAD
AT US RIGHT NOW?

24:38.570 --> 24:40.902
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT LIED ABOUT
OUR GRANDFATHER OUR WHOLE LIVES.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.400
-LOOK, IT'S COMPLICATED.

24:42.410 --> 24:43.673
HE LIVES HALF AN HOUR AWAY.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.444
WHY WOULD YOU
HIDE HIM FROM US?

24:45.450 --> 24:48.044
BILLY: LOOK, OK. I REALIZE
THIS IS CONFUSING FOR YOU BOTH.

24:48.050 --> 24:51.486
I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
FOR THIS FAMILY, OK,

24:51.490 --> 24:52.980
AND IT WAS THE RIGHT
DECISION.

24:52.990 --> 24:55.914
OLIVIA: SAYS WHO?
BILLY: SAYS ME, THAT'S WHO.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.558
I'M GONNA TELL HIM, HE'S
GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.050
OLIVIA: WHAT? NO, WHY
DOES HE HAVE TO LEAVE?

24:59.060 --> 25:01.256
JORDAN: YOU AFRAID
SOMETHING WILL COME OUT, DAD?

25:01.260 --> 25:02.853
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

25:02.860 --> 25:05.466
DO YOU THINK I'M KEEPING
SECRETS FROM YOU?

25:05.470 --> 25:06.926
- I KNOW YOU'RE KEEPING SECRETS.
“OH. HEY--

25:06.930 --> 25:09.137
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING IN HERE?

25:09.140 --> 25:10.460
COME HERE. IN HERE.

25:10.470 --> 25:11.960
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS,
BUT YOUR F--

25:11.970 --> 25:15.736
YES, WILLIE IS HERE,
AND THESE TWO INVITED HIM.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.572
IT WAS OLIVIA. I TOLD YOU
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

25:17.580 --> 25:19.571
OLIVIA: WHA--OH, OK,
SHERLOCK HOLMES.

25:19.580 --> 25:21.275
THIS WASN'T MY BIG IDEA.
IT WAS YOURS.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.645
-YES.

25:22.650 --> 25:24.482
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAS
THE HOTS FOR SPENCER.

25:24.490 --> 25:25.639
WHOA. WHAT? HOLD UP.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.118
YOU ARE AN ASS,
YOU KNOW THAT?

25:27.120 --> 25:28.588
THIS WHOLE THING STARTED
BECAUSE OF YOU

25:28.590 --> 25:30.080
AND YOUR MESSED-UP
DADDY ISSUES.

25:30.090 --> 25:31.751
-MY DADDY ISS--
-YEAH! YOUR DADDY ISSUES.

25:31.760 --> 25:35.060
YEAH-
-OK, ENOUGH.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.097
COULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL IS

25:37.100 --> 25:38.192
GOING ON HERE.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.669
AND WHY, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
IS YOUR FATHER

25:40.670 --> 25:42.331
IN OUR LIVING ROOM?

25:42.340 --> 25:44.331
YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD
AS MINE.

25:44.340 --> 25:46.399
SPILL IT NOW...

25:46.410 --> 25:47.730
OR ELSE!

25:47.740 --> 25:50.675
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW,
YOU GOT TO ASK.

25:52.610 --> 25:55.147
IS SPENCER OUR BROTHER?

26:03.890 --> 26:07.428
YOU TWO THINK THAT I'M
SPENCER'S FATHER?

26:07.430 --> 26:09.319
NO, I DIDN'T.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.593
AND THEN I DID.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.399
AND NOW I-- I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.732
IT WAS
JORDAN'S THEORY.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.265
NICE. THANKS A LOT.

26:17.270 --> 26:19.534
ENLIGHTEN US,
JORDAN.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.634
OK, YOU MOVED SPENCER
INTO OUR HOME.

26:21.640 --> 26:22.937
LOOK, HOLD UP. HOLD UP.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.806
I HAD NO CHOICE BECAUSE
YOU TRIED

26:24.810 --> 26:26.448
TO BLOCK HIS TRANSFER TO
BEVERLY HILLS.

26:26.450 --> 26:27.940
AND THEN AT THE BARBER SHOP,

26:27.950 --> 26:30.009
I FOUND OUT YOU HAD
A PAST WITH HIS MOM.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.840
SORRY YOU HAD TO FIND OUT
THIS WAY, MOM,

26:31.850 --> 26:33.215
BUT--BUT DAD,
HE AND GRACE HAD--

26:33.220 --> 26:35.382
I KNOW. THEY DATED
IN HIGH SCHOOL. I KNOW.

26:35.390 --> 26:37.313
IS THAT YOUR BOMBSHELL
EVIDENCE?

26:37.320 --> 26:38.526
OLIVIA: WELL, I MEAN,

26:38.530 --> 26:40.180
YOU WERE MAKING PAYMENTS
FOR 17 YEARS,

26:40.190 --> 26:42.454
AND WE THOUGHT THAT IT
WAS CHILD SUPPORT,

26:42.460 --> 26:45.100
BUT THE ADDRESS LED US
TO GRANDPA.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.365
EXACTLY. AND HE'S
IN MY HOUSE NOW.

26:48.370 --> 26:49.633
SORRY.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.096
LAURA: I'M SPEECHLESS.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.364
YOU TWO ARE THE WORST DETECTIVES
IN THE WORLD.

26:53.370 --> 26:54.838
BILLY: THE WORST.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.205
THE INVESTIGATION
WAS FLAWED.

26:56.210 --> 26:57.848
OK, WE GOT IT.
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR,

26:57.850 --> 26:59.739
YOU'RE NOT SPENCER'S
FATHER?

26:59.750 --> 27:00.808
BILLY: JORDAN, NO.

27:00.810 --> 27:03.370
I AM NOT SPENCER'S DAD.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.382
I TOLD YOU.

27:05.390 --> 27:08.155
OK. WELL, UM, YOU KNOW,

27:08.160 --> 27:10.288
I SAY WE PUT THIS LITTLE
MISUNDERSTANDING BEHIND US

27:10.290 --> 27:11.519
AND GO GET SOME CAKE.

27:11.530 --> 27:12.782
-YUP.
-UH, NO.

27:12.790 --> 27:14.383
BILLY: MM-MM, MM-MM.

27:14.390 --> 27:15.425
THIS CASE WILL
REMAIN OPEN

27:15.430 --> 27:16.591
UNTIL WE DETERMINE

27:16.600 --> 27:18.159
THE APPROPRIATE
PUNISHMENT,

27:18.170 --> 27:19.399
BUT UNTIL THEN,

27:19.400 --> 27:20.925
WE HAVE GUESTS!

27:20.930 --> 27:25.208
SO COULD EVERYBODY JUST SMILE?

27:33.910 --> 27:35.776
WILLIE: A STRANGE
BUNCH THERE, HUH?

27:35.780 --> 27:37.316
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.243
SPENCER JAMES?

27:39.250 --> 27:41.412
-HEH HEH!

27:41.420 --> 27:43.149
NO, BUT I KNOW YOU.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.889
YOU'RE ALL THE TALK AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD THESE DAYS.

27:44.890 --> 27:47.723
SOUTH CRENSHAW'S STAR
WIDE RECEIVER

27:47.730 --> 27:49.824
BOOKING IT TO BEVERLY.

27:49.830 --> 27:53.528
HMM. ONE OF BILLY'S
BOYS NOW, HMM?

27:53.530 --> 27:54.964
THAT'S RIGHT.

27:54.970 --> 27:56.631
SO YOU HERE
FOR THE PARTY?

27:56.640 --> 27:57.937
THE PARTY'S FOR ME,
ACTUALLY.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.659
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY,
AND I LIVE HERE.

28:00.670 --> 28:03.970
IS THAT RIGHT?

28:05.950 --> 28:08.442
I'M SORRY. I AIN'T
CATCH YOUR NAME.

28:08.450 --> 28:12.239
WILLIE, WILLIE BAKER.

28:12.250 --> 28:15.288
I'M BILLY'S DAD.

28:15.290 --> 28:17.110
I THOUGHT YOU ALL TWO
DIDN'T SPEAK.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.454
WE DON'T. HAVEN'T
IN A LONG TIME, ANYWAY,

28:20.460 --> 28:22.952
NOT SINCE HE MARRIED LAURA.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.828
IF ONLY HE COULD'VE
HELD ON TO YOUR MOM.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.832
WAIT. MY MOM
AND COACH BAKER?

28:28.840 --> 28:31.866
OH, YEAH, MAN!
THEY WERE THICK AS THIEVES

28:31.870 --> 28:33.269
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.272
THOUGHT FOR SURE THEY WERE
GONNA END UP TOGETHER.

28:35.280 --> 28:39.808
NEVER SEEN TWO KIDS
SO MUCH IN LOVE.

28:44.380 --> 28:45.484
HEY.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.481
HEY.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.959
HAVE WE BEEN HERE
LONG ENOUGH?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.429
I WASN'T TIMING
OUR ATTENDANCE.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.750
WELL, I'M READY TO GO.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.194
ARE YOU SURE? I DON'T
THINK EVERYBODY

28:55.200 --> 28:57.328
AT THE PARTY'S HEARD
ABOUT DADDY'S BLACK CARDS.

28:57.330 --> 29:00.664
I TOLD YOU TODAY 1 DID NOT
WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS.

29:00.670 --> 29:02.490
AND--AND YOU WEREN'T.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.990
WHEN YOU EMBELLISH AND--

29:04.000 --> 29:05.104
JUST SAY THE WORD.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.862
WHEN YOU LIE AND I
KNOW ABOUT IT,

29:06.870 --> 29:08.872
IT MAKES ME COMPLICIT
IN THE LIE,

29:08.880 --> 29:11.770
AND IT'S EMBARRASSING
TO WATCH.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.544
SORRY THAT MY LIFE
EMBARRASSES YOU.

29:13.550 --> 29:14.847
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

29:14.850 --> 29:17.171
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.388
-LAURA.
-HI, WILLIE.

29:24.390 --> 29:27.519
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME
CRASHING YOUR PARTY LIKE THIS.

29:28.660 --> 29:30.799
WE'RE FAMILY.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.019
I SEE YOU BOUGHT
A NEW HOUSE.

29:33.030 --> 29:36.034
UH, NO. WE'VE BEEN
HERE FOR A WHILE NOW.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.509
HMM. WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH THE OLD ONE?

29:38.510 --> 29:40.535
NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU?

29:41.640 --> 29:43.369
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE NEXT ONE.

29:44.710 --> 29:46.508
YOUR FATHER WAS JUST
ADMIRING OUR HOUSE.

29:46.510 --> 29:48.410
I WAS. IMPRESSIVE.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.446
YOU'RE REALLY LIVING THE
O.J. LIFE NOW, AREN'T YOU, SON?

29:58.390 --> 30:00.586
YOU JUST CAN'T HELP
YOURSELF, CAN YOU?

30:00.590 --> 30:02.297
HA HA!

30:02.300 --> 30:04.098
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET UP OUT OF HERE.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.693
-HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. I--
-COME ON, MAN. LET'S GO.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.566
I JUST GOT HERE.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.789
LET'S GO.

30:12.140 --> 30:15.235
SO I GUESS FAMILY
ISN'T ALWAYS WELCOME.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.038
BILLY: IT'S
A PRIVATE PARTY.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.906
-SPENCER, STAY OUT OF THIS.

30:18.910 --> 30:20.173
YOU AIN'T SEEN
YOUR DAD IN YEARS,

30:20.180 --> 30:21.648
AND NOW HERE HE IS
MAKING AN EFFORT?

30:21.650 --> 30:23.049
YOU DON'T KNOW
OUR HISTORY, SON.

30:23.050 --> 30:24.370
LET'S BE STRAIGHT
HERE, COACH.

30:24.380 --> 30:25.814
IS IT HIS HISTORY
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

30:25.820 --> 30:27.640
OR THE ONE YOU GOT
WITH MY MOM?

30:27.650 --> 30:29.789
GRACE: THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

30:29.790 --> 30:32.054
SO WHY YOU AIN'T
TELL ME?

30:37.900 --> 30:39.698
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW IT WAS MY IDEA,

30:39.700 --> 30:41.395
YOU TRANSFERRING TO BEVERLY.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.732
I THOUGHT IF YOU KNEW BILLY
AND I HAD A PAST TOGETHER--

30:43.740 --> 30:46.539
SO YOU LIED TO ME?

30:51.110 --> 30:53.477
AND YOU TOLD ME NOT
TO GO SEE MY DAD,

30:53.480 --> 30:55.812
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE HE'D
HAVE TOLD ME

30:55.820 --> 30:57.276
ABOUT YOU AND MY MOM, RIGHT,

30:57.280 --> 31:00.614
THAT HE WAS GONNA
TELL ME THE TRUTH?

31:00.620 --> 31:02.179
RIGHT?

31:09.700 --> 31:12.499
WHY DON'T NOBODY LOOK
SURPRISED?

31:16.740 --> 31:18.799
I'M OUT.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.562
WHERE YOU GOING?

31:20.570 --> 31:22.334
DAD MAY HAVE LEFT,

31:22.340 --> 31:26.470
BUT AT LEAST HE NEVER
LIED TO ME LIKE THIS.

31:29.850 --> 31:32.285
I GOT TICKETS
TO A FOOTBALL GAME.

32:05.420 --> 32:07.787
I'M LOOKING FOR
COREY JAMES.

32:07.790 --> 32:10.009
WHO'S ASKING?

32:11.890 --> 32:14.951
HIS SON.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.717
LOOK, IF YOU CAME TO TRY
AND STOP ME

32:42.720 --> 32:44.085
FROM TALKING TO MY DAD,

32:44.090 --> 32:45.455
YOU COULD'VE SAVED
YOURSELF THE TRIP.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.224
HE DON'T WORK FOR
EASTERN NEVADA NO MORE.

32:47.230 --> 32:50.723
THE COACH TOLD ME
HE MOVED BACK TO L.A.

32:50.730 --> 32:53.768
SO I GUESS HE STILL DON'T
WANT TO SEE ME, HUH?

32:53.770 --> 32:58.310
HEY. I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.308
YOU AIN'T THE ONLY ONE.

33:03.740 --> 33:06.175
SPENCER, WAIT UP.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.085
SO HOW WAS WORK?

33:20.760 --> 33:21.693
I--

33:21.700 --> 33:24.260
I WASN'T AT WORK.

33:24.260 --> 33:26.763
I WENT TO SPENCER'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY

33:26.770 --> 33:29.091
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.898
I'M SORRY I LIED.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.868
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

33:34.510 --> 33:37.775
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D
ASK TO GO.

33:39.180 --> 33:42.810
NOT BECAUSE I'M
ASHAMED OF YOU,

33:42.820 --> 33:46.120
BUT BECAUSE I'M
ASHAMED OF ME.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.158
MY MOM PUT ME OUT
BECAUSE OF WHO I AM.

33:49.160 --> 33:53.984
AND DEEP DOWN
INSIDE, I FELT LIKE

33:53.990 --> 33:55.526
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT
ABOUT ME.

33:55.530 --> 33:59.296
I REALIZED TONIGHT
THAT YOU'VE

33:59.300 --> 34:01.997
BEEN THERE FOR ME
IN WAYS

34:02.000 --> 34:04.469
THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE
HAVE EVER BEEN.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.805
AND I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE

34:07.810 --> 34:09.733
YOUR PATIENCE.

34:11.810 --> 34:14.302
I JUST FOUND YOU.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.818
I DON'T WANT TO HIDE
THAT ANYMORE.

34:18.820 --> 34:21.687
YOU THINK YOU COULD

34:21.690 --> 34:23.658
HELP ME WITH THAT?

34:25.690 --> 34:29.728
YEAH. I THINK I
CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

34:29.730 --> 34:32.824
MAN: GO, BABY,
FLY TO THE PLACE

34:32.830 --> 34:34.867
I KNOW

34:34.870 --> 34:37.339
IT'S WHO I AM...

34:37.340 --> 34:39.559
YOU KNOW WHY I WANTED
TO COME HERE?

34:42.040 --> 34:46.500
I WANTED TO LET GO
OF MY DAD.

34:46.510 --> 34:48.945
I WANTED TO TELL HIM
THAT I'M MY OWN MAN

34:48.949 --> 34:51.317
AND I DON'T NEED
TO KNOW WHY HE LEFT.

34:53.520 --> 34:58.788
I WANTED TO TELL HIM
THAT I DID ALL OF THIS,

35:00.090 --> 35:05.563
THAT I BECAME THE MAN
THAT I AM ON MY OWN.

35:08.230 --> 35:10.870
AT LEAST I THOUGHT
I DID.

35:10.870 --> 35:13.532
AND YOU ARE YOUR OWN MAN.

35:14.810 --> 35:17.108
AND YOU'RE A DAMN FINE ONE,

35:17.110 --> 35:20.546
BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
DO IT ON YOUR OWN.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.814
YOU NEED A TEAM...

35:27.020 --> 35:29.557
A FAMILY.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.752
AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU
CHOOSE TO BE

35:33.760 --> 35:35.558
A PART OF MINE...

35:39.130 --> 35:42.031
'CAUSE I'VE ALREADY
CHOSEN YOU.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.329
MAN: WILL YOU REACH OUT

35:46.340 --> 35:50.834
AND KEEP ME SANE?

35:55.320 --> 35:58.278
-HI.
-GOOD MORNING.

36:00.820 --> 36:03.585
LISTEN, UM...

36:05.190 --> 36:06.954
YOU WERE RIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

36:08.430 --> 36:10.694
I SHOULD HAVE JUST
LEFT IT ALONE.

36:10.700 --> 36:15.763
ACTUALLY, YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO WAS RIGHT.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.308
THE TRUTH MAY NOT
ALWAYS FEEL GOOD,

36:20.310 --> 36:23.439
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO MOVE FORWARD.

36:27.050 --> 36:30.645
I'M SORRY WE'RE NOT
CLOSE ANYMORE.

36:30.650 --> 36:32.345
NO, THAT'S--THAT'S
MY FAULT.

36:32.350 --> 36:34.409
NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S MINE.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.286
I LET YOU THINK OTHERWISE,

36:36.290 --> 36:38.679
AND I LET EVERYONE ELSE
THINK IT, EVEN MYSELF,

36:38.690 --> 36:41.899
BUT I'M THE ONE
WHO PULLED AWAY.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.621
WHY?

36:50.040 --> 36:51.530
'CAUSE OF WHAT I DID.

36:51.540 --> 36:54.999
BECAUSE I WAS
SO TERRIFIED OF LOSING

36:55.010 --> 36:56.978
THE PEOPLE I LOVE
OVER A MISTAKE

36:56.980 --> 36:59.745
I CAN BARELY EVEN REMEMBER.

37:03.220 --> 37:04.676
LAST YEAR, I GOT WASTED,

37:04.680 --> 37:08.651
AND I DID SOMETHING
I SERIOUSLY REGRET.

37:12.890 --> 37:17.657
I...I SLEPT WITH ASHER.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.299
HE'S--

37:20.300 --> 37:23.190
NO, JORDAN! NO, OK?

37:23.200 --> 37:24.929
JUST, IT WAS MY FAULT, OK?

37:24.940 --> 37:26.362
YOU CAN'T JUST BLAME HIM.

37:26.370 --> 37:27.963
OLIVIA, YES, I CAN.

37:27.970 --> 37:29.278
NO, JORDAN.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.736
PLEASE PROMISE ME THAT YOU
WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

37:30.740 --> 37:33.380
LEILA DOESN'T KNOW, AND
IF SHE EVER FOUND OUT...

37:33.380 --> 37:35.371
PLEASE PROMISE ME.

37:35.380 --> 37:40.944
OK. I PROMISE. YEAH,
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

37:47.790 --> 37:48.951
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.019
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.831
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

38:04.040 --> 38:12.040
WOMAN: MM MM MM

38:19.560 --> 38:22.359
MAN: I'M YOUNG,
AND I'M FOOLISH

38:22.360 --> 38:24.055
MADE BAD DECISIONS

38:24.060 --> 38:25.892
I BLOCK OUT THE NEWS

38:25.900 --> 38:28.562
TURNED MY BACK
ON RELIGION

38:28.570 --> 38:29.992
DON'T HAVE NO DEGREE

38:30.000 --> 38:31.638
I'M SOMEWHAT NAIVE

38:31.640 --> 38:35.270
I'VE MADE IT THIS FAR
ON MY OWN...

38:35.280 --> 38:37.635
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU.

38:37.640 --> 38:38.744
NO.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.502
...AIN'T BEEN
GETTING ME HIGHER

38:40.510 --> 38:44.743
I LIFT UP MY HEAD,
AND THE WORLD IS ON FIRE

38:44.750 --> 38:47.811
WITH DREAD IN MY HEART
AND FEAR IN MY BONES...

38:47.820 --> 38:50.619
I'M READY TO LET HIM
GO NOW.

38:52.930 --> 38:55.399
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
I NEED RIGHT HERE.

38:55.400 --> 38:59.098
...PRAY, PRAY

38:59.100 --> 39:00.170
GRACE: COME HERE.

39:00.170 --> 39:04.334
MAYBE I'll PRAY

39:04.340 --> 39:08.061
I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED
IN YOU, NO

39:08.070 --> 39:10.107
THAT I'M GONNA PRAY

39:10.110 --> 39:12.101
DAD? HEY! HA HA!

39:12.110 --> 39:15.102
HA! WHOA! HA!

39:15.110 --> 39:17.442
-HI.

39:17.450 --> 39:18.645
-OH, I'M GOOD.
-OH, I'M SO SORRY.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.118
I HOPE I DIDN'T
WAKE YOU UP.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.110
NO, NO, NO.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.758
WE JUST GOT IN EARLY.

39:22.760 --> 39:23.659
OH, WE?

39:23.660 --> 39:26.254
YEAH. I WANT YOU TO
MEET SOMEONE.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.354
OK.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.124
MAN: YOU WON'T FIND ME
IN CHURCH

39:30.130 --> 39:31.154
CHOIR: NO

39:31.160 --> 39:32.321
READING THE BIBLE

39:32.330 --> 39:33.866
NO

39:33.870 --> 39:37.261
I AM STILL HERE, AND I'M
STILL YOUR DISCIPLE

39:37.270 --> 39:39.136
I'M DOWN ON MY KNEES

39:39.140 --> 39:40.801
AND BEGGING YOU PLEASE

39:40.810 --> 39:44.576
I'M BROKEN, ALONE,
AND AFRAID

39:44.580 --> 39:46.639
I'M NOT A SAINT

39:46.650 --> 39:48.744
I'M MORE OF A SINNER

39:48.750 --> 39:50.377
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE...

39:51.650 --> 39:53.140
BUT I FEAR FOR
THE WINNERS

39:53.150 --> 39:55.187
WHEN I TRIED TO EXPLAIN

39:55.190 --> 39:57.181
THE WORDS RAN AWAY

39:58.660 --> 40:00.651
THAT'S WHY I AM SITTING
HERE TODAY

40:05.300 --> 40:06.927
YEAH.

40:06.930 --> 40:08.068
I CAME TO TALK.

40:08.070 --> 40:09.993
ABOUT WHAT?

40:12.010 --> 40:15.162
WHY'D YOU SHOW UP
AT MY HOUSE LIKE THAT

40:15.170 --> 40:17.172
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

40:18.580 --> 40:22.369
DON'T KNOW, REALLY.

40:22.380 --> 40:24.371
WHEN YOUR KIDS SHOWED UP
AROUND HERE,

40:24.380 --> 40:26.189
I THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOME HOPE

40:26.190 --> 40:27.589
WE COULD MEND THINGS.

40:27.590 --> 40:30.287
HOPE. WELL, HOW CAN
THERE BE ANY HOPE

40:30.290 --> 40:32.281
IF YOU STILL CAN'T
ACCEPT MY WIFE?

40:32.290 --> 40:33.849
SHE AIN'T ONE OF US, SON.

40:33.860 --> 40:36.192
I CAN ACCEPT YOU,
MY GRANDKIDS.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.690
OK, LOOK, I LOVE LAURA.

40:37.700 --> 40:41.364
SHE'S MY WIFE. SHE'S THE
MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN.

40:41.370 --> 40:43.737
IF YOU CAN'T LEARN
TO ACCEPT HER,

40:43.740 --> 40:46.107
THEN THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT TO TALK ABOUT.

40:48.140 --> 40:49.278
I GUESS WE'RE DONE HERE.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.135
I GUESS WE ARE.

40:52.380 --> 40:53.939
HOW'S THE KID HOLDING UP?

40:53.950 --> 40:56.715
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT SPENCER?

40:56.720 --> 40:58.347
MM-HMM. DIDN'T TAKE
IT TOO WELL LAST NIGHT,

40:58.350 --> 40:59.749
DID HE?

40:59.750 --> 41:01.445
IT WAS JUST A SURPRISE,
THAT'S ALL.

41:01.450 --> 41:02.781
HE'LL BE FINE.

41:02.790 --> 41:07.125
YOU KNOW, YOUR OLD
FRIEND COREY JAMES,

41:07.130 --> 41:08.689
HE CAME AROUND HERE

41:08.700 --> 41:11.397
BEFORE HE SPLIT TOWN
YEARS BACK.

41:11.400 --> 41:15.166
SURE HAD A LOT
TO SAY.

41:20.910 --> 41:23.936
AND IF THAT WAS
SPENCER'S REACTION

41:23.940 --> 41:27.308
TO YOU DATING GRACIE
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

41:27.310 --> 41:30.519
HOW YOU THINK HE'S GONNA
REACT WHEN HE FINDS OUT

41:30.520 --> 41:32.113
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

41:32.120 --> 41:35.249
MAN: NEVER BELIEVED
IN YOU, NO

41:35.250 --> 41:42.395
BUT I'M GONNA PRAY

41:42.400 --> 41:48.624
OOH OOH OOH

42:16.160 --> 42:17.821
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
