WEBVTT

00:05.962 --> 00:07.268
Enjoy, okay?

00:07.398 --> 00:08.921
Come back again. Bye.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.662
Well...

00:10.793 --> 00:12.751
if it isn't
the tree guy.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.536
Uh, can I get a bag

00:14.666 --> 00:16.929
of your finest
- brussels sprouts, please?
- Yes, sir.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.583
You want those pickled?

00:18.714 --> 00:20.716
Nope, I'm good, thank you.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.414
Please, uh, stop harassing
the people in our line, Randy.

00:23.545 --> 00:26.026
I'm just saying
that you can pickle anything.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.158
I pickled a quarter once.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.030
Do not know
what to do with that.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.815
Um, so do you guys have
any Halloween plans?

00:32.945 --> 00:34.382
Yeah, yeah, we're
going to a party.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.514
Um, you know the
actor Liam Neeson?

00:36.645 --> 00:38.429
Yeah, it's his annual
Halloween thing, so...

00:38.560 --> 00:40.910
Yeah, he has a very
particular set of skills,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.564
which allow him to throw
a killer party.

00:42.694 --> 00:45.132
Oh, I didn't know
he lived in the area.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.656
That sounds amazing.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.440
Oh, oh, yeah.

00:49.571 --> 00:50.963
It's-it's not
really a bringer.

00:51.094 --> 00:53.444
What? No, I didn't want to--

00:53.575 --> 00:55.098
I-I couldn't even go,

00:55.229 --> 00:56.752
because...

00:56.882 --> 00:59.233
Sam and I are throwing
our own Halloween party.

00:59.363 --> 01:01.583
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is cool.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.759
It's pretty exclusive. I was
gonna invite the both of you,

01:03.889 --> 01:05.543
but you seem <i>ocupado.</i>

01:05.674 --> 01:06.805
Hey, it's no problem
at all. We'll, um,

01:06.936 --> 01:08.242
we'll stop by
before Liam's.

01:08.372 --> 01:11.288
Yeah, it could be
a nice fresh start

01:11.419 --> 01:12.681
- after the whole tree thing.
- Yeah.

01:12.811 --> 01:15.118
Great.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.164
Uh, what time should I be there?

01:23.605 --> 01:26.042
<i>Which is why
we now have to throw</i>

01:26.173 --> 01:27.609
a Halloween party
tomorrow night.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.263
What's going on?

01:29.393 --> 01:30.438
Oh, Jay wants
to throw a Halloween party

01:30.568 --> 01:32.527
to follow through on a lie
he told our neighbors.

01:32.657 --> 01:33.919
Well, I can't cancel.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.270
They'll think I made
the whole thing up.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.924
Which I don't want them to know.
June and Ally are really cool.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.926
And they're the only
people under 40

01:41.057 --> 01:42.406
within a ten-mile radius.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.800
And I'd really like
for them to like us.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.932
Well, you know we don't
love Halloween.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.761
But we do love a party.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.937
And we haven't had a gala at
Woodstone Mansion for decades.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.852
Count me in.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.593
And when you say count you in,
you mean you'll be here,

01:55.724 --> 01:57.639
as always, wearing the same
clothes as always?

01:57.769 --> 01:59.293
Precisely.
Sam, ask Jay

01:59.423 --> 02:01.077
if plus-ones are allowed.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.732
Isaac wants to know if it's
okay if he brings Nigel.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.429
Oh, yeah, yeah,
any invisible people

02:05.560 --> 02:07.039
who want to come, totally fine.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.693
Oh, God.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.782
I am so nervous.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.785
This is our first party
as whatever it is we are now.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.831
- Boyfriends?
- Ah, it's just

02:15.961 --> 02:17.485
so lovey-dovey.

02:17.615 --> 02:18.790
Murderer and victim?

02:18.921 --> 02:20.575
Not loving the sound
of that one either.

02:20.705 --> 02:21.924
Look,
I want this house filled

02:22.054 --> 02:23.491
with sexy nurses as much
as the next ghost.

02:23.621 --> 02:26.276
But a last-second party
is a tricky proposition.

02:26.407 --> 02:29.497
Halloween is
a very competitive holiday.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.455
Trevor's worried
that nobody's going to show.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.109
And it's not the worst point.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.764
I mean, isn't everybody
already doing stuff?

02:35.894 --> 02:37.331
Babe, come on.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.681
Who doesn't want to go
to a Halloween rager

02:39.811 --> 02:42.031
in a spooky mansion?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.990
It's gonna be awesome.

02:47.384 --> 02:48.907
Go ahead, name something.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.474
I don't know, man.

02:50.605 --> 02:51.823
A strawberry?

02:51.954 --> 02:54.043
Yep, it can be pickled.

02:57.612 --> 03:00.354
Okay, well, I'm going to
get us some more drinks.

03:00.484 --> 03:03.792
I've been in relationships that
had more people than this party.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.882
So, tell us about your costume.

03:07.012 --> 03:09.624
I'm Ruth Maid-er Ginsburg.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.888
I'm here to clean up the mess
left behind by the patriarchy.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.717
Feminism has ruined
this sacred holiday.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.327
Aw, man.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.374
This feather duster would be
perfect for this costume.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.463
- Take it.
- Seriously?

03:22.593 --> 03:23.899
Of course, um...

03:24.029 --> 03:25.770
Can I interest you

03:25.901 --> 03:27.294
in a beady-eyed raven
while we're at it?

03:27.424 --> 03:29.296
Don't just give that away.
That taxidermist

03:29.426 --> 03:31.385
did President Garfield's
beagle.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.474
Thank you
for coming.

03:33.604 --> 03:36.259
I know the turnout has been
subpar to say the least.

03:36.390 --> 03:40.220
On the contrary, I am quite
fond of who is in attendance.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.875
And it is still early.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.748
Perhaps reinforcements
will arrive.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.059
Wasn't me.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.584
What is that horrid smell?

03:56.714 --> 03:58.194
Pete.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.022
It was Pete.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.111
When the Livings walk
through him, it smells.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.287
Stinky Pete is
what we call him.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.725
Yep, guilty
as charged.

04:09.161 --> 04:11.207
P.U.! Am I right?

04:11.338 --> 04:13.035
Okay, Randy either just farted

04:13.165 --> 04:14.863
or Isaac got walked through.
It doesn't matter.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.256
This party is a disaster.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.519
I told you
no one was gonna show.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.173
A last-minute Halloween invite--
it's mission: impossible.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.697
Just because
the party's small

04:22.827 --> 04:25.003
doesn't mean
we can't make it fun.

04:25.134 --> 04:27.397
In my day, the occult was
all the rage. Why not conduct

04:27.528 --> 04:28.877
a séance? What's more
Halloween than that?

04:29.007 --> 04:30.922
That's interesting.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.577
I had one once to impress
Mrs. Astor, and it worked.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.145
The lights flickered, the
smell of death surrounded us,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.016
and I'm just now
realizing that was

04:38.147 --> 04:39.366
Thor and Isaac
messing with us.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.803
- They got you so good.
- Uh-huh.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.761
Jay, the ghosts are saying
that we should have a séance,

04:43.892 --> 04:45.807
and they can use
their powers to make it spooky

04:45.937 --> 04:47.635
- for June and Ally.
- Whatever gets Randy

04:47.765 --> 04:49.593
to stop telling me
about things he can pickle,

04:49.724 --> 04:50.855
I'm in.

04:52.727 --> 04:55.686
Spirits, we ask you
to open your doors

04:55.817 --> 04:57.253
to the realm
of the dead.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.389
I can't believe some people
think this stuff is real.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.652
Pete, you're a ghost.[sighs] That's a fair point.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.436
Now everybody hold hands

05:06.567 --> 05:08.003
and repeat after me.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.570
Spirit, spirit,

05:09.700 --> 05:12.877
draw in near.
From beyond, join us here.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.879
Spirit, spirit,

05:15.010 --> 05:16.751
draw in near.

05:16.881 --> 05:17.882
From beyond,

05:18.013 --> 05:20.058
join us here.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.888
Thor, you messing
with the lights?

05:27.501 --> 05:29.241
That's not funny!

05:29.372 --> 05:31.548
It's happening!

05:31.679 --> 05:33.594
Hey, spirits?

05:33.724 --> 05:36.684
Uh, if you're there, could you,
like, flick the lights or...

05:36.814 --> 05:38.729
hum or something?

05:48.783 --> 05:49.871
Oh.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.485
Spirits?

05:55.616 --> 05:56.791
What the Hades?

05:58.880 --> 05:59.794
Mrs. Woodstone?

05:59.924 --> 06:01.578
Molly.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.275
Who is that?

06:03.406 --> 06:06.583
That is the maid who was
sleeping with Hetty's husband.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.718
So, is that it?

06:10.848 --> 06:11.762
Are we done?

06:11.893 --> 06:13.677
Yep.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.810
Sorry, that was pretty lame.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.645
How dare you show
your face here, Molly?

06:24.775 --> 06:25.994
You think I want
to be here?

06:26.124 --> 06:28.126
I don't even know
how I got here.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.302
Samantha, send her back.
Send her back this instant.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.391
Hi. Trevor Lefkowitz.

06:31.521 --> 06:32.696
Yes, I'm not wearing pants.

06:32.827 --> 06:33.915
But it's because
of a hero move.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.525
Sasappis.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.135
It's a pleasure to meet you.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.572
I watched you for years.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.661
But respectfully,
not in a creepy way.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.750
Wow, smooth, bro.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.142
I have to ask,
what is it like up there?

06:45.230 --> 06:47.450
All I'll say is,
it's remarkable.

06:48.364 --> 06:51.062
But beyond that, I can't say
anything specific or I'll melt.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.848
In fact, I'm not even sure
I was supposed to say that,

06:53.978 --> 06:56.677
but I didn't melt,
so I guess it's okay.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.594
Well, everybody's gone.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.378
Party's over.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.727
What gives, ghosts?

07:03.858 --> 07:05.468
That séance was a dud.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.382
Actually it worked.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.123
Worked in what way?

07:08.253 --> 07:10.081
In the way that a portal
in the ceiling opened up

07:10.212 --> 07:12.127
and now we have a maid
from the Gilded Age

07:12.257 --> 07:13.171
in our kitchen.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.696
That is awesome!

07:15.826 --> 07:17.480
It most certainly is not.

07:17.611 --> 07:18.350
Hetty hates her, and the maid

07:18.481 --> 07:19.439
just wants
to be sent back.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.310
I can't believe it worked.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.138
I bet because it's Halloween.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.748
You know they say
the border between the living

07:24.879 --> 07:26.837
and the dead
thins on Halloween.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.273
If you're right,
then that means our window

07:28.404 --> 07:30.188
to send her back
closes at midnight.

07:30.319 --> 07:33.104
- Unless she wants to stay?
- Yeah, she just got here.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.237
No, I'd like to leave
and go back

07:35.367 --> 07:37.326
to the place where everything's
perfect all the time.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.110
Okay, so how do
we send her back?

07:39.241 --> 07:40.808
Easy, we just do
a reverse curse.

07:40.938 --> 07:43.027
- What?
- We do another séance,

07:43.158 --> 07:44.768
but this time to send her back.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.075
It's like the movie <i>Big,</i>
he made one wish to get big,

07:47.205 --> 07:49.251
and then he had to make
another wish to reverse it.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.470
Do it, do it.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.341
Don't worry, Molly.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.213
We're gonna find your dog.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.869
Spirit, spirit, listen clear.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.959
From the beyond, leave us here.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.180
It's not working.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.268
Well, we tried.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.270
I have a TV in my room.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.577
She's never seen a refrigerator,
but, sure, lead with TV.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.143
So the harlot
just remains?

08:12.274 --> 08:14.537
Well, I may have
been a harlot,

08:14.668 --> 08:15.886
but what about you?

08:16.017 --> 08:18.541
You were a cruel
and vindictive boss.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.108
It's too late
for flattery.

08:20.238 --> 08:21.805
Hey, that's
the same feather duster

08:21.936 --> 08:23.590
Jay gave that neighbor lady.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.157
What's going on?
Did it work?

08:26.288 --> 08:28.159
No, it didn't, but did
you give a feather duster

08:28.290 --> 08:29.813
to June or Ally?

08:29.944 --> 08:32.033
Yeah, and they took it to
Liam Neeson's party. Why?

08:32.163 --> 08:34.122
Well, the ghost maid has
one on her right now.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.254
That's why <i>she</i>
was summoned.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.778
And that's why the reverse
séance didn't work.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.563
We need the feather duster here.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.086
Thor think Thor understand.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.871
In <i>Big</i> he had to find

08:44.001 --> 08:45.176
the Zoltar machine
to reverse the curse.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.570
The feather duster

08:47.701 --> 08:49.529
is our Zoltar machine.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.662
And Thor lost now.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.011
So we just need to get it back.

08:54.142 --> 08:57.014
Yes, uh, except I don't know
where Liam Neeson lives.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.755
I do.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.104
Good grief, man,
I thought you left.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.803
No way. I'm not leaving
my best friend's party.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.718
Okay, we'll unpack
that later.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.546
You know where
Liam lives?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.591
Oh, yeah, huge pickle guy.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.289
I deliver to him all the time.

09:11.420 --> 09:14.031
But you need to drive.
I Rollerbladed here.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.559
Oh, I bet that would
taste terrific

09:19.689 --> 09:21.125
if we could physically
interact with food.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.605
Uh-oh.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.607
Here comes Stinky Pete.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.435
Watch out
for those Livings, chap.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.132
It does smell terrible

09:28.263 --> 09:30.047
when they walk through him.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.962
:
Yep, I am repulsive.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.791
Can I talk to you
for a quick sec, Isaac?

09:34.922 --> 09:36.227
Of course.
Nigel, excuse me.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.838
Yes.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.842
Look, I am more than happy
to help a friend,

09:41.972 --> 09:44.845
but Nigel will find out eventually.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.108
It's just...

09:47.238 --> 09:49.371
:
It's so embarrassing.

09:49.501 --> 09:52.461
I mean, what if I tell him
and he doesn't like me anymore?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.855
Well, then there are plenty
of other fish in the sea.

09:55.943 --> 09:59.120
Okay, not plenty, but there
is that one other guy.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.600
And I don't know
what Thor means when he talks

10:00.730 --> 10:02.123
about "boat rules,"
but that sounds...

10:02.253 --> 10:05.039
- Oh, my God, please stop talking.
- Okay.

10:05.169 --> 10:08.216
How did that floozy get
to heaven and not me?

10:08.346 --> 10:10.610
She's the adulterer,
she brought shame on my home.

10:10.740 --> 10:14.135
Hetty, maybe her being here
is an opportunity.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.050
You mean for me to push her
down the stairs?

10:16.180 --> 10:17.399
That is not bad, Samantha.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.183
She would heal instantly,

10:19.314 --> 10:19.923
but it would be fun
to watch her tumble.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.577
No, I mean an opportunity

10:21.708 --> 10:22.534
for you to get closure.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.101
By forgiving her.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.103
Who knows? Maybe it could
even help you to move on.

10:26.234 --> 10:29.063
Forgiveness? Closure?

10:29.193 --> 10:30.891
I'm sorry,
the words are ridiculous enough,

10:31.021 --> 10:32.675
but coming from someone
in that wig,

10:32.806 --> 10:34.590
I simply cannot.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.157
Probably just as well.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.680
I don't really think
Molly wants any part

10:37.811 --> 10:39.856
of talking to Hetty either.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.945
In the cult, when two people
had a problem, we'd lock them

10:42.076 --> 10:44.426
in a room together
until they worked it out.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.080
Or killed each other,

10:46.210 --> 10:48.430
but these two are
already dead, so we're golden.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.475
We can't lock 'em
in a room, Flower.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.042
They're ghosts, they'll just
walk out through the walls.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.479
Wait, there is
one room in this house

10:54.610 --> 10:56.699
with walls
they can't walk through.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.006
Can one of you walk through the
door and see what's in there?

10:59.136 --> 11:01.704
I'll do it. A Pinecone Trooper's
always up for an adventure.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.838
Oh, Peter!

11:04.968 --> 11:07.014
I've never seen
that happen before.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.364
The vault.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.976
Thanks for coming
down here, guys.

11:13.107 --> 11:15.239
I dropped an earring earlier,
and I need help looking for it.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.850
But all your jewelry
is so cheap.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.678
Why even bother?

11:20.810 --> 11:22.551
Wait, what's she
doing in here?

11:22.682 --> 11:23.770
What's going on, Samantha?

11:23.900 --> 11:25.032
Okay, there is
no earring.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.686
I just think
you guys should talk.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.819
- They're in.
- No, no, no, wait, Flower!

11:29.950 --> 11:31.473
No, no, no, no!

11:31.603 --> 11:33.997
Oh, boy.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.564
Ah!
Oh, sweetie.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.957
Sam's inside.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.698
You just locked her in.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.090
Was that not the plan?

11:40.221 --> 11:41.439
Go!

11:42.614 --> 11:44.138
The handle's made from

11:44.268 --> 11:44.791
a different material
than the door!

11:44.921 --> 11:45.922
We need help.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.619
I'll go get Sam.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.796
She'll know what to do.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.973
It's honestly shocking
she lived as long as she did.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.894
How are we not able
to go through the wall?

12:01.024 --> 12:04.332
Because your former lover

12:04.462 --> 12:06.813
for some reason built this vault

12:06.943 --> 12:08.771
out of a material
impenetrable to ghosts.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.947
And impenetrable
to cell service apparently.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.297
Oh, God. I could die in here.
I could actually die.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.083
You can make
any situation about you.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.128
Meanwhile, I am stuck
down here with someone

12:18.259 --> 12:20.043
whose company I do not enjoy.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.653
How long do you think
it took Elias

12:21.784 --> 12:23.568
to suffocate?
That's Elias?

12:23.699 --> 12:26.615
- His actual body?
- Yes, and why haven't
you removed him yet?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.704
We're trying to space out
our corpse removals.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.141
Do you think it was painful,
his death in here?

12:31.272 --> 12:33.491
I like to fantasize
that it was agonizing,

12:33.622 --> 12:35.537
full of misery and pain.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.495
His hungry lungs crying out

12:37.626 --> 12:39.976
for air that would not come.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.326
Or...

12:42.457 --> 12:44.285
perhaps it was lovely.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.940
Oh, God.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.291
<i>Wow.</i>

12:50.421 --> 12:52.554
This is like Jedi money.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.905
What the hell is this?

12:56.036 --> 12:58.560
I don't know, man,
it looks like a cornichon.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.562
This isn't one of mine.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.216
So this is
how I find out.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.174
Okay.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.046
I'm gonna go find
June and Ally.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.917
Have fun.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.484
L-Liam?

13:09.614 --> 13:10.964
Flower, what were
you thinking?

13:11.094 --> 13:12.792
Why did you lock Sam
inside there, too?

13:12.922 --> 13:14.358
I don't know,
I got confused.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.230
I'm Flower.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.666
Unfortunately that's
hard to argue with.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.494
Oh, Trevor, any
luck texting Jay?

13:19.624 --> 13:21.148
No, the iPad's in a drawer.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.540
Poke I can do,
but pull?

13:22.671 --> 13:23.977
That thing might
as well be in Fort Knox.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.327
How long till Sam
runs out of air?

13:26.457 --> 13:28.024
Has anyone ever seen
someone suffocate?
No.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.634
Does strangling count?

13:30.940 --> 13:33.421
Only take couple of minutes,
but very tough on thumbs.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.423
Okay, that took
a dark turn.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.996
June! Ally!
Wow, what a surprise.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.780
What, what are you doing here?

13:44.911 --> 13:45.825
Well, it's a funny story.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.348
I need
that feather duster back.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.916
Like, right now?

13:50.046 --> 13:52.527
You got an antique
feather duster emergency?

13:52.657 --> 13:54.268
I do, Ally.
Very well put.

13:54.398 --> 13:57.010
Can I give it back
to you after the party?

13:57.140 --> 13:58.707
It, it just kind of
completes my costume.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.144
I wish that worked
for me.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.800
Do you know how weird
you're being right now?

14:04.931 --> 14:06.410
All too well.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.673
Sorry, thank you, and, uh...

14:08.804 --> 14:11.589
hang soon, all right.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.982
Excuse me.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.854
Are these Elias's claw marks?

14:14.984 --> 14:16.899
That doesn't seem good.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.727
Your plan was to lock me in here

14:18.858 --> 14:20.424
with my husband's seductress?

14:20.555 --> 14:23.123
Wait, you think I seduced him?

14:23.253 --> 14:26.256
Of course I do. He was rich,
from a powerful family.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.824
And you were... Irish.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.001
Well, he pursued me.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.961
And I wasn't interested, but...

14:35.091 --> 14:37.877
I didn't know what to say,
so I didn't say anything.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.140
- Power dynamics.
- What?

14:40.270 --> 14:42.794
Should really be conserving
oxygen right now, but here goes.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.449
Elias was in a position of power

14:45.580 --> 14:48.452
over Molly, which he knew, and
I'm sure you needed that job.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.628
Yes. I had a child to feed.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.327
And my husband had perished
at the mill.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.720
Our mill?

14:55.851 --> 14:58.810
I... did not know that.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.683
But I guess I can't blame you
for hating me.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.686
He was your husband
and your cousin.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.340
- Mm.
- And you loved him.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.168
Ha! I didn't love him.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.648
I married him because my father
had to close a land deal.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.085
I quite disliked him.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.478
You see?
You were both victims of Elias.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.394
- No.
- No, that is just
the way things were.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.614
But the way things were
was wrong.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.659
You shouldn't be mad at each
other when the real culprit

15:21.790 --> 15:23.574
is right there.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.750
Both of you were stuck
in a patriarchal system

15:25.881 --> 15:27.491
that pitted women
against each other,

15:27.622 --> 15:29.189
because holding a man
accountable wasn't an option.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.886
We get it, you're a feminist.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.844
But...

15:33.758 --> 15:35.978
...you may have a point.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.153
Thank you.

15:37.284 --> 15:38.763
So...

15:38.894 --> 15:40.374
you hated him, too?

15:40.504 --> 15:41.984
Hated him?

15:42.115 --> 15:45.031
- I despised him.
- Oh.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.076
Did you know I sent him to hell?

15:47.207 --> 15:49.470
- Did you? That's wonderful.
- Mm-hmm.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.515
I hope he didn't give you syphilis.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.083
Nope. I gave him syphilis.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.042
Oh, that's sweet.

15:57.565 --> 15:58.914
<i>Babe!</i>

15:59.045 --> 16:00.742
<i>I got the feather duster.</i>

16:00.872 --> 16:02.613
I alienated June and Ally
for good,

16:02.744 --> 16:05.312
but I got to see what kind
of cheese Liam Neeson likes,

16:05.442 --> 16:07.096
so that's cool.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.576
Babe, where are you?

16:08.706 --> 16:10.491
Okay, Thor, now do your thing.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.797
We got to get him to the
hidden entrance to the vault.

16:14.756 --> 16:15.626
Thorfinn?

16:15.757 --> 16:17.193
Is that you

16:17.324 --> 16:18.803
or 100-year-old wiring?

16:18.934 --> 16:22.503
Thor growing... weary.

16:23.504 --> 16:26.159
Uh, do you want me to go
to the powder room?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.552
Okay, thank you, Spooky Lassie.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.641
Ah, it's working!

16:30.772 --> 16:32.382
Okay, I'm in here.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.384
Now what?

16:40.825 --> 16:43.263
Ah, the mirror.

16:43.393 --> 16:44.655
I get it.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.657
No Pants can write
me a message

16:46.788 --> 16:49.051
if I fog it up.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.227
Okay, I guess
that will work, too.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.795
This is gonna
take a minute.

17:00.497 --> 17:03.283
You guys want to hear
about Liam's cheeses?

17:09.593 --> 17:11.813
"Sam safe." Great!

17:11.943 --> 17:13.945
Thanks, ghosts, I was
starting to getting worried.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.512
"Sam safe"?!

17:15.643 --> 17:17.601
It was shorter than "vault."
I was trying to be succinct.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.342
Flick the lights again, Thor!

17:21.649 --> 17:23.390
Thor out of juice.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.696
Aw, we have to get him back
in there, or Sam's gonna die!

17:26.741 --> 17:28.960
Hold your noses, everyone.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.658
Nigel, I'm sorry. Aah!

17:33.791 --> 17:36.055
Oh, man!

17:36.185 --> 17:37.882
I know that smell.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.536
That's Isaac.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.190
Wait a minute.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.105
Is there something else
you need to tell me?

17:43.236 --> 17:44.628
- Yes, finally!
- Hurry!

17:44.759 --> 17:46.543
You're Stinky Pete?

17:46.674 --> 17:47.849
Yes.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.069
Stinky Pete is I.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.635
Okay, not the most pressing,
but it feels like

17:51.766 --> 17:52.984
we can retire the nickname now.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.074
"Sam in safe."

17:55.204 --> 17:57.163
- Sam's in the safe?!
- Yes.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.170
Her breathing
seems labored.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.781
I am rooting for you, Samantha,
but, on the other hand,

18:06.911 --> 18:08.826
it would be nice
to spend eternity together.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.698
Sort of a win-win
situation.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.615
- Jay, thank God!
- Don't worry.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.007
I got you.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.705
You okay? What are you
doing in the vault?

18:17.835 --> 18:18.923
Ghost thing.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.795
How did you find me?

18:20.925 --> 18:23.058
Ghost thing.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.634
Okay, we have three minutes
till midnight, let's do this.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.071
I guess this is goodbye.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.681
It is amazing, you know.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.293
That the one Irish person
I truly took

18:40.423 --> 18:42.164
the time to get to know

18:42.295 --> 18:44.035
is also the only decent one.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.212
I'm not sure that's
the right takeaway here.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.431
It's progress,
let her have it.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.608
I don't blame you if
you want to end things.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.263
Isaac, I don't want
to end things.

18:54.394 --> 18:57.440
I am disappointed you felt
you couldn't be honest with me.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.616
But I think
your power is impressive.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.966
You can still
affect worldly matters.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.708
And you're my date.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.624
Not bad for a skinny Brit
with webbed feet.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.063
"Webbed feet"?
Good one, Nigel.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.283
Yes.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.981
Could you imagine?

19:18.940 --> 19:20.594
We're sure we're making
the right decision?

19:20.724 --> 19:23.292
- I mean, they're good now.
- Let's do this.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.207
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, uh...

19:25.338 --> 19:26.687
- got the duster.
- Okay.

19:26.817 --> 19:29.777
Spirit, spirit, listen clear.

19:29.907 --> 19:33.694
From the beyond, leave us here.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.527
Take me with you!

19:40.657 --> 19:42.616
I've changed!

19:42.746 --> 19:44.574
Let me ride you
while you get sucked off!

19:44.705 --> 19:46.489
Don't leave me here
with these peasants!

19:46.620 --> 19:48.622
Take me with you!

19:51.581 --> 19:53.192
- Peasants?
- Wow.

19:53.322 --> 19:53.844
- Rude.
- Really?

19:53.975 --> 19:56.412
Oh, get over it.
