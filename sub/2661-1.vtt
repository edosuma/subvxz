02:06.500 --> 02:10.501
I was living in this duplex.
For the first time, I was alone.

02:10.661 --> 02:17.060
No dorm, no roommates,
my own place. I was so happy.

02:18.819 --> 02:22.100
I had my own parking space.

02:37.659 --> 02:40.859
Where I come from,
they don't keep them in cages.

02:41.018 --> 02:46.499
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.

03:03.579 --> 03:05.059
- Hello.
- Need some help?

03:05.219 --> 03:07.660
No, I...
Well, yeah, thanks.

03:17.259 --> 03:18.618
I'm from Spain.

03:18.778 --> 03:22.259
- Really? Which part?
- Galicia.

03:22.659 --> 03:25.899
I'm taking engineering at U of W.
I like Seattle.

03:26.059 --> 03:30.138
"U-Dub."
That's what people call it here.

03:30.298 --> 03:33.978
Finally, a local tells me
some secrets.

03:35.138 --> 03:38.818
You don't have to stay.
This is gonna take some time.

03:38.979 --> 03:41.139
Where else do I have to go?

03:41.299 --> 03:46.298
In one week, I have to go back
to Spain. My visa runs out.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.578
U- Dub.

04:18.697 --> 04:22.497
This is Linda Powell from
the Seattle Environmental Council.

04:22.657 --> 04:25.097
Okay, great. Thank you. Bye-bye.

04:25.258 --> 04:29.297
Yes, that's right,
there's another spill in Bellingham.

04:29.457 --> 04:32.217
We gotta get somebody out there...

04:32.377 --> 04:35.937
Ruth, how long have I been saying
there are no guys?

04:36.098 --> 04:37.418
Forever.

04:37.578 --> 04:41.216
I met one. I met one
when I was least expecting it.

04:41.376 --> 04:42.817
You held out on me.

04:42.976 --> 04:45.497
He's an engineering student
from Spain.

04:45.657 --> 04:49.378
His visa runs out in two days. He's...

04:49.937 --> 04:53.377
He's like a comet. What do I do?

04:54.177 --> 04:55.658
I wish you could stay.

04:55.816 --> 04:59.776
If I overstay my visa,
I can't come back for five years.

05:00.096 --> 05:04.137
- Were you ever gonna come back?
- Well, now I have a reason.

05:07.257 --> 05:10.216
I want you to have this.

05:11.737 --> 05:15.656
I wish I was better able to tell you
what I am thinking.

05:15.817 --> 05:20.496
But this is a symbol of our future.

05:23.176 --> 05:28.017
I want to return in two months
and see you again.

05:32.977 --> 05:37.375
I don't really have much
to give you, but...

05:39.215 --> 05:40.856
It's important to me.

05:43.096 --> 05:46.097
Use this when you get back.

05:48.736 --> 05:52.176
You'll always have a parking space.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.616
Hello.

06:07.776 --> 06:11.816
Don't wake up. I'm getting
on the plane. I wanted to say bye.

06:11.975 --> 06:18.376
- I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.
- Goodbye, honey. I miss you already.

06:20.695 --> 06:24.256
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he left?

06:24.416 --> 06:30.294
It's amazing. We can't hide things
in language. We speak in basics.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.015
"Basics"?

06:32.175 --> 06:37.495
If I married him, he could live here.
I'd always have someone to go out with.

06:37.695 --> 06:40.936
You're talking
about marrying this guy?

06:41.375 --> 06:44.255
I'm tired of all the games.

06:47.094 --> 06:51.015
If you were married,
would we still go out dancing?

06:51.695 --> 06:54.774
- We will always go out dancing.
- What?!

06:54.974 --> 06:58.535
We will always go out dancing!

07:52.974 --> 07:57.174
This is the Genie. Can't go wrong
with this garage-door opener.

07:57.334 --> 08:02.013
Here's the Liftrex and the Liftrex
Super. Might be more than you need.

08:02.173 --> 08:05.253
And, of course,
the Linear pocket pager, beeper...

08:05.413 --> 08:08.853
...garage-door opener combo.

08:09.854 --> 08:13.734
Give me the best one you have.
I'll never lose it again.

08:26.014 --> 08:29.734
I recently broke up with Jennifer,
my last girlfriend.

08:29.893 --> 08:33.053
I did it in a crowded restaurant.

08:33.373 --> 08:37.493
She just stared at me with that look:
"How can you pass me up?"

08:37.653 --> 08:41.332
I told her we weren't right,
all the stuff we both knew.

08:41.493 --> 08:45.853
I realized I was wrong, tried to get
back with her. She won't see me.

08:46.013 --> 08:48.533
Now she's with Tony.

08:50.612 --> 08:54.452
Tony knows my friend Bailey, who's
friends with Tony's other girl, Rita.

08:54.612 --> 08:57.853
Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.

08:58.013 --> 09:01.652
So do I tell Jennifer I know
Tony's going out with Rita...

09:01.812 --> 09:05.052
...or do I tell Rita I know
about Tony and Jennifer?

09:05.213 --> 09:08.612
Tony will tell Jennifer I was
dating Rita when I was with her.

09:08.773 --> 09:12.211
How does stuff get so complicated?
I don't know.

09:12.892 --> 09:18.132
Sometimes I wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once.

09:21.891 --> 09:23.972
Isn't that great?

09:28.053 --> 09:30.291
I don't know. I think...

09:30.452 --> 09:32.731
Cliff! I'm talking here, man.

09:35.892 --> 09:37.732
I'm back to the beginning.

09:37.892 --> 09:40.932
My dad left home when I was 8.
He said to me:

09:41.092 --> 09:44.532
"Have fun. Stay single."

09:45.251 --> 09:46.891
I was 8.

09:47.851 --> 09:51.691
My mom's a teacher. She took me
to a doctor to learn about sex.

09:51.851 --> 09:52.971
He was from Boston.

09:53.131 --> 09:58.211
The father and the mother
have finally learned to come together.

09:58.371 --> 10:02.171
The father inserts his penis...

10:02.332 --> 10:06.170
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?

10:08.770 --> 10:13.530
The father inserts the penis
into the mother's vagina.

10:13.691 --> 10:19.252
This is called intercourse,
and what comes out is called sperm.

10:19.611 --> 10:24.370
And then, the man keeps moving until
something squirts out of his penis.

10:24.531 --> 10:27.330
- What?
- Yeah, what comes out?

10:27.490 --> 10:30.851
- Spam!
- Oh, man!

10:34.011 --> 10:37.531
So maybe it was never simple.
I'll tell you this...

10:37.691 --> 10:42.571
...for the next three years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.

10:42.730 --> 10:46.490
Work is the only thing
I have complete control over.

10:47.289 --> 10:48.891
Work.

10:49.090 --> 10:50.850
I gotta go.

11:17.730 --> 11:21.730
I'm 23. Remember how old 23
seemed when you were little?

11:21.889 --> 11:26.370
I thought people would be traveling
in air locks and I'd have five kids.

11:26.530 --> 11:29.250
Here I am, 23.

11:29.409 --> 11:33.130
Things are...
They're basically the same.

11:33.290 --> 11:36.770
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.

11:36.929 --> 11:41.889
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.

11:43.289 --> 11:46.889
I get inspiration from my boyfriend.
He's a musician.

12:01.369 --> 12:06.049
His band put out an independent album
last month. He's a good artist too.

12:14.448 --> 12:17.448
He's like a Renaissance man.

12:17.608 --> 12:20.129
I'm so glad he moved into my building.

12:39.048 --> 12:42.168
Janet. What's the ordeal?

12:42.528 --> 12:47.289
Your machine wasn't on, and I was
supposed to see you Saturday but...

12:47.447 --> 12:51.007
So I just thought I'd come by
and say, hi.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.568
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:53.728 --> 12:57.768
- So how about this weekend?
- This weekend we're really busy.

12:57.928 --> 13:00.128
- We got that show, right?
- Yeah, that show.

13:00.288 --> 13:02.968
- We got these guys coming from L.A.
- Great.

13:03.128 --> 13:05.449
- It's gonna be rocking.
- Bye, Cliff.

13:05.607 --> 13:08.007
- So come over after.
- Deal.

13:10.167 --> 13:14.167
Look, Janet, you know
I see other people still, right?

13:14.368 --> 13:17.207
You do know that, don't you?

13:18.808 --> 13:20.848
You don't fool me.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.047
Janet, I could not
be fooling you less.

13:24.608 --> 13:27.488
Cliff, you gotta move your truck, man.

13:27.847 --> 13:30.527
I know what you're thinking.
We connected.

13:30.687 --> 13:35.008
And when you make the connection,
chemistry takes care of itself.

13:35.167 --> 13:39.807
So sit back and enjoy it because
you know when it's real. This is real.

13:39.967 --> 13:43.006
We just don't even have to discuss it.

13:43.727 --> 13:46.887
Janet, you're spazzing off on me.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.567
Hey, Cliff, while we're young.

14:03.167 --> 14:08.447
So I'll see you Saturday, and then
I'll help you with your speakers.

14:11.607 --> 14:15.687
What can I say, man?
She's crazy about me.

14:19.287 --> 14:21.446
Check it out, my new Gortec watch.

14:21.887 --> 14:25.006
I can store 20 numbers.
Tonight, I'll fill it.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.327
All or nothing.
Tonight, I'll be the super me.

14:28.686 --> 14:33.126
What if the super you meets the super
her, and the super her rejects you?

14:33.286 --> 14:35.687
- Then it's no problem.
- Why?

14:35.846 --> 14:39.286
Because it was never you.
It was just an act.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.526
- I live my life like a French movie.
- What?

14:45.486 --> 14:48.646
Webster and 24th, it should be here.

14:49.805 --> 14:52.927
Let's ask this clown
where the club is.

14:54.525 --> 14:55.926
Hey, man...

14:56.086 --> 14:58.245
...where's De Soto?

15:00.645 --> 15:03.966
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.

15:04.126 --> 15:07.845
Well, give me a ride,
and I'll show you.

15:08.846 --> 15:11.366
Where's De Soto? Our car broke down.

15:14.285 --> 15:18.405
I'll tell you about love.
Love disappears, baby.

15:18.886 --> 15:22.645
When I've been broke,
babe has been off like a prom dress.

15:22.805 --> 15:25.166
Maybe it's the girls you choose.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.966
Maybe I've been hurt,
or I've been dogged!

15:28.125 --> 15:31.885
- Know where this place is?
- Do I look like a Thomas Guide?

15:32.045 --> 15:34.244
- You really shouldn't speak.
- Yes.

15:34.404 --> 15:36.645
- Where do you work?
- I'm a maître d'.

15:36.805 --> 15:40.005
- Department of Transportation.
- Solving the gridlock.

15:40.165 --> 15:42.365
I build airplanes.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.723
- Hey.
- Hello.

17:19.362 --> 17:23.242
My friend and I have this argument,
and here it is.

17:23.403 --> 17:25.963
He says when you're
at a place like this...

17:26.123 --> 17:29.243
...you can't just be yourself,
you need an act.

17:29.404 --> 17:31.924
So anyway, I saw you standing there...

17:32.444 --> 17:35.523
...so I thought,
A: I could just leave you alone.

17:35.683 --> 17:41.682
B: I could come up with an act,
or C: I could just be myself.

17:42.243 --> 17:44.122
I chose C.

17:44.282 --> 17:46.683
What do you think?

17:48.163 --> 17:50.962
I think that
A: You have an act...

17:51.123 --> 17:55.842
...and that
B: Not having an act is your act.

17:58.522 --> 18:00.163
Thank you.

18:05.803 --> 18:11.083
Cliff, any comments on the Seattle
sound and Citizen Dick's place in it?

18:11.243 --> 18:14.881
I don't like to reduce us just
to being part of Seattle.

18:15.041 --> 18:17.321
I think of us expanding more.

18:17.481 --> 18:20.162
We're huge in Europe right now.

18:20.322 --> 18:24.162
We've got records...
A big record just broke in Belgium.

18:30.403 --> 18:33.481
A song like "Touch Me, I'm Dick"
is about what?

18:33.641 --> 18:37.602
I think "Touch Me, I'm Dick,"
in essence, speaks for itself.

18:37.762 --> 18:42.242
I think, you know, that's basically
what the song is about.

18:42.402 --> 18:44.001
It's about, you know...

18:44.162 --> 18:47.682
A lot of people might think
it's actually about...

18:47.842 --> 18:50.481
...my name is Dick,
and you can touch me...

18:50.642 --> 18:54.081
...but I think, you know,
it can be seen either way.

18:56.042 --> 18:58.401
- Hey, excuse me! Hello.
- Hi.

18:58.562 --> 19:01.081
- Want to meet up later?
- Where you going?

19:01.241 --> 19:04.241
- Anywhere you're going.
- Anywhere you're going.

19:04.401 --> 19:06.242
- We're going home.
- Going home.

19:06.401 --> 19:09.402
- Do you have a...?
- See you.

19:10.121 --> 19:12.481
"Anywhere you're going."

19:12.641 --> 19:15.402
Always get their numbers.
I got 20 numbers.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.881
Twenty numbers.

19:17.041 --> 19:21.281
Bailey, you got 20 numbers
of 20 girls that you will never call...

19:21.441 --> 19:24.320
...never go out with,
never see in the daylight.

19:24.481 --> 19:29.400
Twenty numbers that exist only to make
you feel like you can get 20 numbers.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.761
- Watch the volume.
- Sorry. Tinnitus.

19:31.921 --> 19:35.801
- Club disease.
- You kids are all going to be deaf.

19:35.961 --> 19:37.121
Bailey.

19:38.081 --> 19:39.721
This is my night.

19:40.002 --> 19:42.001
- What?
- Look.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.919
Linda, don't look over.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.160
Cliff, I need another double latte,
no cream, skim milk, decaf.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.359
I'm going to use that video date
you got me last Christmas.

20:37.519 --> 20:40.039
- It was a joke.
- I know. I know.

20:40.199 --> 20:44.278
You think it's something desperate
people do. You are wrong!

20:44.439 --> 20:48.679
Expect the Best is the best
video-dating in the country. Hi!

20:48.839 --> 20:51.479
Debbie Hunt.
Call me before I go to Cabo.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.680
- Your medication, Miss Hunt.
- Thank you.

20:55.479 --> 20:59.079
You make the greatest coffee.
Doesn't he make...? You...

20:59.279 --> 21:03.120
My roommate has no domestic...
Guys just don't know...

21:06.239 --> 21:09.559
- Did you get the tunnel stuff?
- I'll call you back.

21:09.719 --> 21:13.838
The I-90 construction is behind.
No green time from the exits.

21:13.999 --> 21:17.159
The Times asked why
there's gridlock on the I-5.

21:17.318 --> 21:20.398
It's God's way of saying,
"Listen to the radio."

21:20.559 --> 21:23.079
Did you read my proposal?
What'd you think?

21:23.239 --> 21:25.878
I liked it.
You have to move it past Stu.

21:26.039 --> 21:27.200
- Stu?
- After lunch.

21:27.359 --> 21:29.839
After lunch, okay. After lunch, Stu.

21:29.999 --> 21:33.159
- Ted, what's up?
- Making music with my fingers.

21:33.318 --> 21:36.518
And what a beautiful sound it is.

21:45.519 --> 21:48.718
Linda Powell, Steve Dunne. Hey.

21:48.879 --> 21:53.078
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.
Yeah, that was me.

21:53.238 --> 21:56.118
Listen, you want to get
some dinner or...?

21:56.278 --> 21:59.438
Busy. How about some lunch?
Have a lunch.

21:59.599 --> 22:01.078
Coffee?

22:01.558 --> 22:04.397
Water? How about some water?

22:04.558 --> 22:08.997
I'll meet you where you're having
lunch, and we'll have some water.

22:09.197 --> 22:13.078
I think that this whole decade
will be about cleaning up.

22:13.238 --> 22:17.278
Our project spent last year studying
the Alaskan Exxon spill.

22:17.438 --> 22:23.397
And now... And now
with all the Exxon kickbacks, it's...

22:23.557 --> 22:26.758
- God, yes. The worst.
- Yes.

22:26.917 --> 22:31.558
I'm trying to put together a group
to go study the whole coast.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.957
I'm having a little trouble
trying to get a boat.

22:35.118 --> 22:36.998
I think it will work out.

22:40.878 --> 22:45.037
- What?
- There's just no privacy anymore.

22:47.237 --> 22:49.717
I thought he was literally
gonna swallow her.

22:49.916 --> 22:52.037
- Me too.
- My God.

22:52.197 --> 22:54.197
Do you know what time it is?

22:54.358 --> 22:56.278
- Yeah, 3:30.
- Oh, I'm so late.

22:56.437 --> 22:59.478
- I'm glad your lunch date didn't show.
- Me too.

22:59.637 --> 23:03.157
- Did you really have a lunch date?
- No.

23:04.156 --> 23:06.316
- Maybe...
- I'm getting over somebody.

23:06.477 --> 23:09.997
- Nothing big.
- I think it's a bad time to get...

23:10.157 --> 23:11.837
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.877
Here's my car.
Let me give you a ride back to work.

23:16.037 --> 23:19.356
Okay. Thanks.

23:25.196 --> 23:26.676
Thanks.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.596
I really like your take
on the supertrain.

23:46.757 --> 23:49.436
It's ambitious.
If it were up to me...

23:49.596 --> 23:53.916
She opened my car-door button.
Unmistakable sign.

23:54.076 --> 23:56.195
I like this girl.

23:56.396 --> 23:58.796
Gotta handle this one really well.

23:58.955 --> 24:02.955
The thing I like about you the best
is that you listen to me.

24:03.116 --> 24:07.916
- You're a realist-slash-dreamer.
- Thanks.

24:10.516 --> 24:13.236
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.

24:13.396 --> 24:19.795
That some jerk could trash the Mona
Lisa or an ocean or someone's life.

24:20.075 --> 24:24.356
So who are your neighbors?

24:25.475 --> 24:28.876
That's Bailey, right there.
He's a maître d'.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.595
He keeps us all on free meals.

24:31.955 --> 24:35.755
And on the corner there,
that's Debbie Hunt.

24:37.155 --> 24:40.475
She actually consumes men
instead of food.

24:42.395 --> 24:47.275
And that is Cliff.
He delivers flowers, has four jobs...

24:47.435 --> 24:50.394
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.754
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.

24:52.915 --> 24:56.675
She works there too. She's
saving for architecture school.

24:56.835 --> 24:59.035
Cliff and Janet.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.674
That's it.

25:05.235 --> 25:08.594
You sound like me talking
about my family.

25:09.594 --> 25:12.914
Wanna go upstairs
while your stuff is still drying?

25:29.274 --> 25:31.913
That's a good picture of you.

25:32.794 --> 25:36.114
Let me ask you a question.
You think about traffic?

25:36.314 --> 25:41.754
Because I do, constantly. Traffic
is caused by the single car driver.

25:41.914 --> 25:45.434
900,000 single people
get in their cars every morning.

25:45.593 --> 25:48.514
They drive and wonder why
there's gridlock.

25:48.673 --> 25:52.594
This is what I've been working on.
If you had a supertrain...

25:52.754 --> 25:58.034
...you give people a reason to get out
of their cars. Coffee, great music...

25:58.194 --> 26:00.913
...they will park and ride.
I know they will.

26:01.074 --> 26:03.633
But I still love my car, though.

26:03.793 --> 26:05.873
Well... Oh.

26:06.954 --> 26:10.353
The Sonics.
They've got a good team this year.

26:10.513 --> 26:13.034
Good thing they traded
Xavier McDaniel.

26:13.194 --> 26:17.473
- Is he a boxer or a basketball player?
- You dare to rip the X-Man.

26:19.353 --> 26:23.473
"Kiss at the Hotel de Ville."
You have this too. I have this.

26:23.632 --> 26:27.673
And albums.
Oh, I miss albums.

26:30.633 --> 26:33.633
- I was a deejay in college.
- Really?

26:33.793 --> 26:36.633
That's why I still have records.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.233
So any boyfriends?

26:53.393 --> 26:56.671
You don't want to know.
I've had bad luck.

26:57.192 --> 27:02.673
But there was this one guy, Rich.
All my girlfriends loved him.

27:03.392 --> 27:06.633
That stuff I told you
about the money I inherited?

27:06.792 --> 27:10.672
I made that up. Plus, I got
back together with Lynn last night.

27:10.833 --> 27:13.873
So you probably want to go ahead
and freak out.

27:16.832 --> 27:21.312
Oh, man. That was
like a professional hit.

27:21.472 --> 27:24.832
I didn't wanna get close
to anybody for a long time.

27:24.992 --> 27:26.032
And then I...

27:26.192 --> 27:28.592
- I'm talking too much.
- No, go ahead.

27:28.752 --> 27:32.432
Well, I thought for sure I would
meet someone in college.

27:32.592 --> 27:37.431
A perfect combination of Mel Gibson
and Holden Caulfield...

27:37.591 --> 27:42.072
...and the sexual revolution
would just sweep us both away.

27:42.232 --> 27:44.513
I was a semester too late.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.472
Hi.

28:16.631 --> 28:19.311
Condoms. They're free.

28:29.151 --> 28:32.711
You know, it's okay
to loathe these people.

28:32.871 --> 28:34.671
Really?

28:35.430 --> 28:39.470
There is so much life in you.

28:39.630 --> 28:44.470
And so much emotional larceny
in these others.

28:46.869 --> 28:49.950
- I'm Andy.
- I'm Linda.

28:50.150 --> 28:52.031
Emotional larceny?

28:52.190 --> 28:57.110
We talked about how passion didn't
matter as much as comfort, stability.

28:57.271 --> 28:59.231
- That's bullshit.
- No kidding.

28:59.391 --> 29:01.591
- Sorry.
- It's cool.

29:03.549 --> 29:07.830
We lived together for two years.
We're still friends, but...

29:07.990 --> 29:09.590
I did the same thing.

29:09.750 --> 29:13.631
One day, one of you goes
for groceries and never comes back.

29:13.790 --> 29:16.830
Everyone I know wants
everything to be easy.

29:17.230 --> 29:21.229
- Why did I have to meet you in a club?
- I don't know.

29:23.029 --> 29:26.709
Oh, I love this song.

29:43.830 --> 29:45.908
My clothes.

29:49.710 --> 29:50.709
This is you?

29:50.870 --> 29:53.989
This gas-guzzling monster?
The environmentalist?

29:54.149 --> 29:57.229
- I inherited it.
- Not sure how I feel about that.

29:59.829 --> 30:02.990
So let's maybe do something
this weekend or...

30:03.149 --> 30:05.909
- Okay. I'll call you.
- Okay. Don't forget.

30:06.069 --> 30:07.309
I won't.

30:13.949 --> 30:15.428
Good night.

30:26.709 --> 30:28.349
Good night.

30:29.589 --> 30:30.590
Good night.

30:35.669 --> 30:38.148
Listen, next time, why don't you...

30:39.228 --> 30:41.748
...park underground?

30:46.469 --> 30:48.149
I should go.

31:17.908 --> 31:20.908
Grab whatever you can.
Keep whatever you want.

31:21.067 --> 31:24.667
It's all yours free,
only at Shop for Less.

31:42.067 --> 31:46.387
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

32:02.946 --> 32:08.506
Burglar, burglar, burglar,
burglar, burglar.

32:28.746 --> 32:31.147
Neighbors.

32:32.227 --> 32:35.506
It's Andy. Just calling
to make sure you're okay.

32:35.666 --> 32:38.306
I was thinking about the conversation.

32:38.466 --> 32:41.226
Trust him, although
he's putting on moves.

32:41.386 --> 32:44.226
Passive-aggressively speaking.
I'm a guy.

32:44.386 --> 32:47.186
I don't like that I know them,
but I know.

32:47.346 --> 32:51.186
I think that you can trust him,
but you certainly want to...

32:51.346 --> 32:54.746
If he doesn't treat you right,
I'll kick his ass.

32:56.066 --> 32:58.985
Starring Fred MacMurray.

33:01.586 --> 33:06.026
Can you wait?
Just a little longer. Okay?

33:06.185 --> 33:10.186
- Whenever, whenever.
- You're amazing.

33:10.346 --> 33:14.106
I feel like I'm being pulled
inside you.

33:14.266 --> 33:17.185
We're being too loud.

33:20.185 --> 33:24.066
What are you thinking
right now?

33:26.506 --> 33:28.786
I play good, hard-nosed basketball.

33:28.946 --> 33:31.826
Things happen in the game.
Nothing you can do.

33:31.986 --> 33:35.184
I don't go and say,
"I'm gonna beat this guy up."

33:35.345 --> 33:39.065
- Anything else, X?
- Yes. Steve, don't come yet.

33:55.024 --> 34:00.586
God, I'm in love with my neighbor.
Why don't you call me, Cliff?

34:03.586 --> 34:07.665
What can I eat? I'm tired
of starving myself for this guy.

34:07.985 --> 34:10.664
Salad. I'll have a salad.

34:15.264 --> 34:17.984
If I call him, that's being desperate.

34:18.145 --> 34:23.424
He's late or he forgot. I refuse to
call him to remind him he forgot.

34:23.583 --> 34:27.105
If he shows up, I'll listen.
No way do I call him.

34:28.464 --> 34:31.864
Of course, men do like to be called.

34:32.264 --> 34:37.224
I'll call him in 10 minutes. That will
be one hour, and that is very late.

34:40.864 --> 34:43.263
He is offiicially very late.

34:46.743 --> 34:50.664
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.

34:51.703 --> 34:53.664
Two out of three.

34:58.984 --> 35:02.824
Wait. Did no basket mean call him
or don't call him?

35:07.303 --> 35:10.623
Busy. That's a sign.
That's fate saying don't call.

35:10.783 --> 35:15.264
Forget it. I am not desperate. I have
many people to spend time with.

35:16.424 --> 35:20.104
- Quit getting involved with neighbors.
- That broke us up?

35:20.264 --> 35:22.503
- We're better as friends.
- Absolutely.

35:22.663 --> 35:26.582
The thing about Cliff is,
he has all this fierce integrity.

35:26.743 --> 35:28.983
- I know.
- Except when it comes to women.

35:29.143 --> 35:32.023
He likes these club-type women...

35:32.184 --> 35:35.063
...these huge, hourglass,
Amazon women.

35:35.824 --> 35:40.342
It's great you're together,
but you've got to protect yourself.

35:41.262 --> 35:44.183
So I'm not an Amazon woman?

35:45.903 --> 35:48.543
You're from the high plains, Janet.

35:54.103 --> 35:56.383
I'm so glad I live here.

36:15.623 --> 36:19.302
- Are my breasts too small for you?
- No.

36:20.702 --> 36:22.662
God.

36:30.302 --> 36:34.341
Because, I mean, I look around,
and all I see are these...

36:34.501 --> 36:39.542
...posters and billboards
and magazines and TV shows...

36:39.702 --> 36:42.462
...all with these women
with huge breasts.

36:42.622 --> 36:45.662
I guess I just...
I guess I just wanted to ask.

36:45.822 --> 36:49.262
Is that what men really want?
Is that what you want?

36:49.422 --> 36:50.582
You know?

36:50.821 --> 36:55.741
Don't lie because when you do, your
eye twitches, and I know it anyway.

37:00.661 --> 37:03.222
Okay, ask me.

37:04.862 --> 37:07.661
Are my breasts too small for you?

37:15.061 --> 37:16.221
Sometimes.

37:34.821 --> 37:37.101
Have you had implants before?

37:37.861 --> 37:40.060
What do you think?

37:40.861 --> 37:42.421
No.

37:42.901 --> 37:47.780
Yes. Well, you take a couple of days
and make up your mind.

37:47.939 --> 37:51.220
We skew the size specifically
to what you want...

37:51.380 --> 37:53.860
...by graph. Right.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.101
Well, what's painful?

37:56.460 --> 38:00.701
It can be mildly painful, and certainly
safety is on everybody's mind...

38:00.861 --> 38:02.860
...mine in particular.

38:03.102 --> 38:08.499
Right. Okay, you take a couple
of days and think about it.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.700
All right. Bye-bye.

38:12.140 --> 38:14.701
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:14.980 --> 38:19.020
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a couple of days.

38:20.340 --> 38:24.020
How about that?

38:31.740 --> 38:37.500
Maybe for your frame,
something a little less hourglass.

38:38.140 --> 38:42.899
If you're going to have the operation,
you know, have the operation.

38:46.580 --> 38:50.900
- Whoa. Do you jog?
- A little.

38:51.139 --> 38:54.819
See, maybe, here.

38:56.380 --> 39:00.499
- Split the difference?
- Split the difference.

39:23.459 --> 39:27.419
Hi, it's me.
I'm tired of doing the right thing.

39:27.579 --> 39:30.738
I'm tired of waiting for you
to call me.

39:31.779 --> 39:36.698
I'm on the bed right now, wearing
something really outrageous.

39:36.897 --> 39:40.299
I've got no underwear on.

39:40.498 --> 39:44.859
I need to be touched.
I'm burning for you, Cliff.

39:45.579 --> 39:50.098
I think you've got the wrong number,
lady, but I'll be right over.

39:58.298 --> 40:01.098
- This guy plays no games.
- That's great.

40:01.298 --> 40:02.498
Yeah.

40:02.698 --> 40:05.939
- I've got to play this one perfectly.
- Go with it.

40:06.098 --> 40:09.458
- What do your instincts say?
- Not to listen to you guys.

40:09.618 --> 40:12.737
- There you go.
- Don't tug at her bra strap.

40:12.897 --> 40:17.497
She wants mystery, drama, excitement.
I know women.

40:17.697 --> 40:21.698
I don't want drama or excitement.
I just want to trust him.

40:21.858 --> 40:25.738
- Should I trust him?
- Yeah.

40:25.978 --> 40:30.097
- Not all guys are like Luiz.
- You're right.

40:30.417 --> 40:33.337
You're right. Steve is different.

40:33.537 --> 40:37.736
Just follow your instincts.
Don't treat this like casual sex.

40:37.978 --> 40:42.297
Casual sex doesn't even exist anymore.
It's lethal. It's over.

40:47.576 --> 40:49.577
What are you thinking?

40:49.776 --> 40:54.977
If I had a conversation with God,
I would ask him to create this girl.

40:55.177 --> 40:57.618
My chest hurts.

40:57.818 --> 41:01.777
- You didn't, like, leave a note?
- No, I left my blue T-shirt.

41:01.977 --> 41:04.936
- There are no mistakes.
- What?

41:05.136 --> 41:08.577
What is that? What's that mean?
Give me the phone.

41:08.776 --> 41:13.417
I'm going to call my
new semigirlfriend.

41:13.617 --> 41:16.016
You're gonna scare her off.

41:16.216 --> 41:19.016
She's beautiful.
Anyone would call her.

41:19.257 --> 41:22.816
- Distinguish yourself by not calling.
- Yep.

41:23.016 --> 41:27.337
- P.S., that's how you get her.
- No, Bailey, you don't understand.

41:28.017 --> 41:32.097
Am I the only one that remembers
your last three girlfriends?

41:34.577 --> 41:36.696
You're right.

41:38.257 --> 41:41.656
I gotta let this one breathe.

41:42.135 --> 41:47.736
Yes. You're concerned about dioxins.
Let me give you Greenpeace's number.

41:52.096 --> 41:54.856
- So how'd it go?
- I got the boat.

41:55.056 --> 41:58.136
- The trip to Alaska's set.
- Oh, great, Linda.

41:58.376 --> 42:01.015
- That is great.
- Yeah.

42:02.176 --> 42:08.296
- Oh, Steve on two.
- Four days he waits to call me.

42:08.496 --> 42:11.096
So, what do I tell him?

42:11.296 --> 42:15.095
- Tell him I went out for groceries.
- Okay.

42:15.736 --> 42:17.895
She went out for groceries.

42:18.135 --> 42:20.936
Bye-bye.

42:21.135 --> 42:23.655
He's coming right over.

42:23.855 --> 42:26.376
- What do you mean, nothing?
- Nothing is wrong.

42:26.575 --> 42:29.376
Really. Thanks.

42:29.575 --> 42:32.336
- We connected.
- This is a small office.

42:32.575 --> 42:35.535
- Is this because I didn't call?
- Did you call?

42:35.695 --> 42:39.095
I don't know why you're
being like this. I like you.

42:39.335 --> 42:42.495
I'll call you, or you call me.

42:49.255 --> 42:55.015
- I'm sorry if I blew it by not calling.
- You don't owe me anything.

42:55.175 --> 42:58.574
- Is this about your ex who calls?
- Andy doesn't.

42:58.735 --> 43:00.054
- Ponytail, right?
- No.

43:00.214 --> 43:04.495
- Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.
- He is not Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.

43:09.055 --> 43:13.695
- You're scared of getting close to me.
- You don't know me.

43:13.934 --> 43:16.894
- I think I do.
- No, you don't.

43:18.974 --> 43:21.215
Look, let's not play games.

43:21.414 --> 43:25.975
Games? If I was playing games,
I would have waited a week to call.

43:27.974 --> 43:31.094
- What I mean is...
- I've gotta work, Steve.

43:31.294 --> 43:35.094
- Linda? I left my blue T-shirt at...
- Bye, Steve.

43:44.534 --> 43:49.533
Why? Why do you talk such a good game?

43:49.693 --> 43:56.054
You talk about things that matter,
that get me excited, that get me hot.

43:57.694 --> 44:03.574
But it's like you're lobotomized.
Why can't I just protect myself?

44:03.774 --> 44:08.293
Why can't I just be a buddy?

44:08.733 --> 44:13.133
Glad I caught this one in time.
I can't leave myself open.

44:13.373 --> 44:15.494
It's better to be the dumper.

44:15.813 --> 44:18.694
Mom... Mom! Yeah.

44:18.894 --> 44:23.693
Listen, Mom, if he invited you
to Hawaii, yes, he wants something.

44:23.933 --> 44:29.093
And who cares?
Dad's been gone for two years.

44:30.133 --> 44:32.332
Listen. Listen, Mom!

44:32.574 --> 44:36.934
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
Do you think you could hold it down?

44:37.173 --> 44:41.932
Wait, Mom. Rinse your dishes before
you put them in the dishwasher.

44:42.133 --> 44:43.732
I rinsed them, Debbie.

44:43.932 --> 44:47.333
You have to rinse off
the food or it gets all over.

44:47.533 --> 44:52.012
I found this big, little chunky thing
on my glass. No biggie.

44:52.172 --> 44:57.092
So. Yeah, wish me luck on my video
for Expect the Best.

45:05.653 --> 45:06.893
Hi.

45:07.052 --> 45:10.573
- This is for Expect the Best, right?
- I brought clippings.

45:10.732 --> 45:12.732
Possible looks for my video.

45:12.973 --> 45:17.053
Here we have
the Edie Sedgwick. You know?

45:18.892 --> 45:21.531
Pseudo-Brigitte Bardot.

45:22.092 --> 45:27.691
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed millionairess.

45:29.372 --> 45:34.053
And I love these earrings
that nobody loves but me.

45:34.892 --> 45:36.491
Truth?

45:37.092 --> 45:38.891
Truth.

45:42.251 --> 45:47.052
I will create your new look.
I will have men dying at your feet.

45:47.692 --> 45:50.972
Ten bucks extra,
and Brian will shoot your video.

45:54.731 --> 45:56.491
Twenty.

45:57.771 --> 46:00.571
He doesn't even know me.

46:00.771 --> 46:02.691
Debbie...

46:02.971 --> 46:06.931
...he is only like the next
Martin Scor-ceese.

46:07.092 --> 46:11.651
Okay. Okay, I'm in your hands.

46:22.052 --> 46:23.770
I am Debbie Hunt.

46:24.371 --> 46:27.851
If you want to see how I look,
rewind and freeze-frame.

46:28.531 --> 46:31.850
But I am not about looks.

46:37.771 --> 46:39.171
Hi.

46:39.370 --> 46:43.010
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.

46:43.251 --> 46:48.610
My goals are serenity and knowledge
and men who can understand me.

46:49.170 --> 46:51.611
Oh, no druggies, please.

46:51.850 --> 46:56.010
I'm fairly intense, and
I'm an advertising exec...

46:56.170 --> 47:01.490
...at KRWE-TV. That's me.

47:01.690 --> 47:07.290
Come to where the flavor is.
Come to Debbie country.

47:16.690 --> 47:18.290
Yeah.

47:20.329 --> 47:22.930
"Debbie country." It's funny.

47:30.250 --> 47:32.809
- "Doghouse" as an encore?
- Six songs.

47:32.969 --> 47:35.890
- They want me.
- They are just our friends.

47:36.090 --> 47:39.970
- "Doghouse" as an encore.
- You can't start out with that.

47:40.130 --> 47:42.608
Why make them clap
so we come out again?

47:42.769 --> 47:45.289
- You don't get it.
- I agree with Cliff.

47:45.449 --> 47:49.209
- Hey, a review of our record.
- Whoa, read it out loud.

47:49.410 --> 47:52.010
"When the shirtless Cliff
starts to sing..."

47:52.169 --> 47:57.130
Wait a minute, man. I don't
want to hear anything negative.

47:57.290 --> 47:59.449
Go on.

48:20.488 --> 48:23.528
Other than that, "He was ably backed
by Stone and Jeff...

48:23.768 --> 48:27.689
...and drummer Eddie Vedder."
That's good. That's a good review.

48:27.969 --> 48:32.568
- A compliment for us is one for you.
- No, man.

48:32.729 --> 48:36.168
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.

48:36.329 --> 48:39.728
We will not retreat.
This band is unstoppable.

48:39.968 --> 48:43.288
This weekend, we rock Portland.

48:44.448 --> 48:46.288
Yeah!

48:50.488 --> 48:53.729
Okay, are you sure
you want to do this?

48:53.967 --> 48:57.288
Yep. My mind is made up.

48:57.728 --> 48:59.928
Want to read a magazine?

49:00.167 --> 49:03.288
Thanks for doing this with me, Steve.

49:03.568 --> 49:06.208
I didn't want you to go alone.

49:16.248 --> 49:20.768
Tell me, from a girl's point of view,
what do you want from a guy?

49:20.928 --> 49:25.128
Well, when I first moved
out here from Tucson...

49:25.368 --> 49:28.287
...I wanted a guy with...

49:28.528 --> 49:32.807
...looks, security, caring.

49:33.047 --> 49:35.567
Someone with their own place.

49:35.767 --> 49:40.288
Someone who said "bless you"
or "gesundheit" when I sneezed.

49:40.447 --> 49:44.328
Someone who liked the same
things as me, but not exactly.

49:44.567 --> 49:47.087
And someone who loves me.

49:48.126 --> 49:51.527
- Tall order.
- Yeah, I scaled it down a little.

49:51.727 --> 49:54.087
What is it now?

49:54.447 --> 49:58.728
Someone who says "gesundheit,"
although I prefer "bless you."

49:58.967 --> 50:00.567
It's nicer.

50:00.807 --> 50:04.407
- Janet, sorry you had to wait.
- Dr. Jamison.

50:04.847 --> 50:06.687
This is my friend, Steve.

50:06.926 --> 50:09.967
- Doctor.
- Hi, Steve. Come on in.

50:10.167 --> 50:13.167
Hey, last chance.

50:17.487 --> 50:19.767
Here we go.

50:19.967 --> 50:23.407
I'm going to say something
that I haven't said...

50:23.646 --> 50:27.206
...in three years of being an HMO.

50:27.966 --> 50:32.527
I will perform the operation,
but I don't think you need it.

50:32.766 --> 50:34.567
I think you're perfect.

50:34.767 --> 50:40.207
If your boyfriend doesn't appreciate
you the way you are, then ask:

50:40.447 --> 50:45.286
"Are you his Miss Right,
or are you his Miss Maybe?"

50:45.965 --> 50:47.885
Wow.

50:48.046 --> 50:50.567
What's that mean, "wow"?

50:50.766 --> 50:54.366
- Did my check bounce?
- No.

50:54.526 --> 50:56.126
Janet...

50:57.087 --> 51:00.286
...I really have
a feeling about you.

51:02.285 --> 51:06.005
Thanks, but I love my boyfriend.

51:06.206 --> 51:08.085
Okay.

51:09.086 --> 51:13.565
- I still feel good about what I said.
- Oh, no, you should. It's good.

51:16.966 --> 51:19.966
- Can I say something to you?
- Sure.

51:20.165 --> 51:23.525
Your face wants
a different part, your hair.

51:23.766 --> 51:27.565
- My hair?
- Yeah.

51:30.525 --> 51:31.926
Yeah, there you go.

51:32.126 --> 51:34.205
Now you look vaguely rocking.

51:34.406 --> 51:37.084
You are a happening guy, you know?

51:37.284 --> 51:39.925
You're Dr. Jamison.

51:40.165 --> 51:46.085
You've got nice eyes, and you've got
those great trustworthy eyebrows...

51:46.285 --> 51:50.445
...and you're a surgeon, man.
Many, many babes are into that.

51:50.645 --> 51:52.405
Yeah.

51:52.645 --> 51:54.844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:55.045 --> 51:59.885
No, really. Listen, I have friends
who would love you.

52:00.124 --> 52:02.485
See, I don't know how to have fun.

52:02.725 --> 52:06.925
I'm 33 years old, and I don't
know how to have fun.

52:12.644 --> 52:16.485
There. Now was that fun or what?

52:17.124 --> 52:19.204
Yeah, that was fun.

52:32.164 --> 52:36.884
- Doc.
- Yeah, I know, the operation.

52:41.764 --> 52:45.283
I want Cliff to like me the way I am.

52:48.283 --> 52:49.884
Thanks.

52:53.363 --> 52:57.964
A few days later, she leaves the hive.
Now she's ready to mate.

52:59.364 --> 53:03.323
High in the sky, the only
male bees, the drones...

53:03.564 --> 53:06.923
So Portland, maybe it wasn't our city.

53:07.163 --> 53:10.443
Man, where are the anthems
of our youth?

53:11.163 --> 53:14.003
What happened to music
that meant something?

53:14.163 --> 53:17.683
The Who at the Kingdome
or Kiss at the Coliseum.

53:17.844 --> 53:24.204
Where is the "Misty Mountain Hop"?
Where is the "Iron Man" of today?

53:24.962 --> 53:28.683
- We're not going out tonight, are we?
- Look at this.

53:28.843 --> 53:35.243
These bands are bottles of bleach.
It's beer and lifestyle music.

53:35.643 --> 53:39.723
It's like the next world war's
gonna be sponsored by...

53:39.963 --> 53:42.684
...I don't know, I mean, what?

53:43.962 --> 53:45.922
We could just take a bath.

53:46.082 --> 53:51.283
Just remember one thing,
we are loved in Belgium and in Italy.

53:51.482 --> 53:54.803
The yellow jacket wasp
has come looking for food.

53:55.363 --> 53:57.763
The alarm is sounded.

54:06.362 --> 54:11.483
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.
I'm playing this weekend...

54:15.043 --> 54:18.723
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

54:18.961 --> 54:25.081
I don't have to be here.
I could just break up with him.

54:30.962 --> 54:36.362
I've always been able to do this.
Break up and never look back.

54:39.321 --> 54:45.081
Being alone,
there's a certain dignity to it.

55:18.720 --> 55:19.961
Hi!

55:20.121 --> 55:24.882
Hi, did I overreact?

55:25.360 --> 55:27.362
Do you know who this is?

55:56.480 --> 56:00.481
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.

56:01.760 --> 56:06.961
But whenever things are at their best,
I start waiting for them to fall apart.

56:07.121 --> 56:12.920
I can't fiigure out if I do it to myself
or if life does it for me.

56:13.240 --> 56:18.680
- I'm a bit late this month, that's all.
- Well, how...? How late?

56:20.720 --> 56:22.361
Late.

56:39.840 --> 56:42.400
- Steve Dunne.
- Yeah.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.880
Doug Hughley. Mr. Deegan's class.

56:45.040 --> 56:49.159
- What is up? How you doing, man?
- Okay, man.

56:49.359 --> 56:52.280
You know how much homework
I missed because of you?

56:52.479 --> 56:56.640
I loved your radio show.
That was the best. Thanks, man.

56:56.839 --> 57:01.160
We're throwing down tonight
on Aloha Street. It's gonna be insane.

57:01.320 --> 57:03.999
- Would you do some wheels of steel?
- Oh, no.

57:04.239 --> 57:05.718
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

57:05.918 --> 57:10.880
You're the only man I know who can mix
Elvis Costello and Public Enemy.

57:20.519 --> 57:23.358
You're the best, man!
You are the king.

57:24.039 --> 57:27.279
You gotta be there, man.
You must be there!

57:28.359 --> 57:31.079
Of course, you may be busy.

57:33.919 --> 57:37.279
Ten minutes and we pour
X into B. If it's blue...

57:37.479 --> 57:41.079
- Then we have a big talk.
- Yeah.

57:46.158 --> 57:50.318
- I have some time right now.
- Then let's talk right now.

57:50.558 --> 57:54.159
- My body knows it's going to be blue.
- It's not gonna be blue.

57:54.359 --> 57:56.477
- It won't be blue.
- You're right.

57:56.638 --> 58:00.758
I'm probably sterile.
It runs in my family.

58:02.958 --> 58:08.078
- Do you know where my other shoes are?
- No, maybe they're by the door.

58:08.758 --> 58:10.558
- That would be wild.
- What?

58:10.758 --> 58:13.158
Having a kid.

58:14.517 --> 58:18.077
- If you were pregnant.
- If I were pregnant, but I'm not.

58:18.278 --> 58:22.277
And I would not expect you
to deal with it anyway.

58:22.957 --> 58:25.837
Well, I'd be with you.
We'd deal with it.

58:29.438 --> 58:31.877
To friendship.

58:38.957 --> 58:42.077
- That's bluish, right?
- It's fairly blue.

58:42.318 --> 58:44.798
- Well...
- Put it against something blue.

58:45.037 --> 58:47.878
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

58:48.078 --> 58:52.277
Well, wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.

58:58.117 --> 59:01.517
- What are you gonna do today?
- Meet the deputy mayor.

59:01.677 --> 59:07.198
- Sets up the thing with the real mayor.
- I have stuff to do. Do, or call you...

59:07.437 --> 59:08.717
- Okay.
- Bye.

59:08.957 --> 59:11.277
- Bye.
- Bye.

59:14.676 --> 59:16.197
- Finally...
- Interesting.

59:16.436 --> 59:22.397
...if we get the single car driver on
the supertrain, we can change the city.

59:22.637 --> 59:25.276
It's all in the proposal.

59:30.636 --> 59:34.677
Well, flirts with brilliance.
Wish it were up to me.

59:34.876 --> 59:38.477
Let me get you 15 minutes
with the mayor.

59:39.156 --> 59:40.396
Thank you.

59:41.556 --> 59:46.515
Basically, that's kind of what
we're all about, give or take a little.

59:46.756 --> 59:51.955
I'd kind of like to leave it up to you.
Figure out what you'd like to do.

59:52.156 --> 59:56.957
I think that will be great. Yeah.
You've explained it really well.

59:59.556 --> 01:00:02.316
All right, these
are the men who want me.

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:06.875
But I'm more than just a good body.
Feelings, man.

01:00:07.076 --> 01:00:11.316
I have a lot of tender feelings
waiting for the right woman.

01:00:11.556 --> 01:00:15.557
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this.

01:00:15.756 --> 01:00:20.675
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.
My painting is displayed behind me.

01:00:20.915 --> 01:00:25.915
I'm a very meticulous person
in appearance and also very precise.

01:00:26.115 --> 01:00:29.075
If two people really
believe in each other...

01:00:29.235 --> 01:00:32.875
...love can go around the world
and through their souls.

01:00:33.076 --> 01:00:35.076
But love is very delicate.

01:00:35.275 --> 01:00:39.434
In fact, if you're both not very
nurturing, that love can:

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.715
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.

01:00:42.954 --> 01:00:47.314
Someone who is complex.
Someone who is willing to experiment.

01:00:47.515 --> 01:00:50.475
I like the way the world
looks from a bicycle.

01:00:50.635 --> 01:00:55.435
I'm looking for someone who feels
the same way I do about a bicycle.

01:00:55.636 --> 01:00:59.155
Am I too intense?
I can be intensely laid-back too.

01:00:59.354 --> 01:01:04.475
I am very, very, very lonely.

01:01:10.515 --> 01:01:14.874
- Who?
- Definitely the bicycle guy.

01:01:15.155 --> 01:01:16.915
The bicycle guy.

01:01:17.154 --> 01:01:20.075
He's like your soul mate.

01:01:20.314 --> 01:01:21.835
Guy with the bicycle.

01:01:39.834 --> 01:01:42.274
Nice outfit.

01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:45.274
- Is he late?
- Yeah.

01:01:45.514 --> 01:01:49.674
- Yeah, but I expect the best.
- Yeah.

01:01:49.913 --> 01:01:54.394
Why did you pick this Sea Merchant?
The First Avenue one is happening.

01:01:54.554 --> 01:01:57.835
- There's another Sea Merchant?
- Yeah, the new one.

01:01:58.034 --> 01:01:59.594
Oh, no.

01:02:00.713 --> 01:02:03.394
- On your right!
- On your right!

01:02:03.634 --> 01:02:07.874
- On your right!
- On your right!

01:02:21.474 --> 01:02:24.594
Was there a Jamie
looking for a Debbie Hunt?

01:02:24.793 --> 01:02:27.473
Yes, and he left you a message:

01:02:27.672 --> 01:02:31.912
"I got your address from Expect
the Best. I'll be at your house."

01:02:32.114 --> 01:02:34.873
He was hot.

01:02:45.993 --> 01:02:49.952
Desperation, it's the world's
worst cologne.

01:02:52.313 --> 01:02:54.352
- Lot of salt.
- You are good at that.

01:02:54.513 --> 01:02:56.713
- This is the key to popcorn.
- Is it?

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:59.713
- Swirl with the bowl.
- Good, put the bowl down.

01:02:59.874 --> 01:03:02.393
- Let's make some more.
- You want more?

01:03:02.552 --> 01:03:04.752
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

01:03:15.952 --> 01:03:18.673
- More popcorn.
- Stop, stop, stop.

01:03:18.832 --> 01:03:20.952
- What, what, what?
- Stop, stop, stop.

01:03:21.111 --> 01:03:23.112
- Want more?
- How does this work?

01:03:23.872 --> 01:03:26.512
- Do you want butter?
- Do I want butter?

01:03:26.672 --> 01:03:27.872
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:28.032 --> 01:03:29.832
- Debbie.
- Jamie.

01:03:30.032 --> 01:03:34.713
- Wow, you represent well in real life.
- Thanks a lot. So do you.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.113
Thank you.

01:03:36.272 --> 01:03:39.511
When I missed you,
I just buzzed down.

01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:42.672
Look who I ran into,
Pammy from U-Dub.

01:03:42.871 --> 01:03:45.471
- Pamela. I'm Pamela.
- Oh, you're Pamela.

01:03:45.672 --> 01:03:49.992
Pam-ela, did you see that package
out on the porch for you?

01:03:50.192 --> 01:03:55.272
- No, Jamie and I, we're making popcorn.
- Yeah, popcorn with Kermit.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:59.271
I would love to show you
this package on the porch.

01:03:59.472 --> 01:04:02.671
- Just for a second.
- Okay. All right.

01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:04.111
- Okay.
- See you.

01:04:04.272 --> 01:04:05.512
Sure.

01:04:08.072 --> 01:04:12.272
- We always said, separate lives, Pam.
- It's no biggie, all right?

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:15.632
- It's a major biggie!
- Look, I knew him first.

01:04:15.831 --> 01:04:19.391
I guess that gives you the right
to bone him in my kitchen.

01:04:20.111 --> 01:04:23.751
If I wanted that guy,
I wouldn't need a video date.

01:04:23.951 --> 01:04:27.112
You'd wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:32.351
- I make popcorn with whomever I want.
- You've done it with half the city!

01:04:32.512 --> 01:04:35.311
At least I don't have to chase
the popcorn.

01:04:37.631 --> 01:04:41.031
I don't think we should
take this vacation together.

01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:45.070
Remember how you told me to
tell you when you're being plastic?

01:04:45.311 --> 01:04:47.311
This is so unfair.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:50.072
- How much do you want for him?
- $200.

01:04:50.711 --> 01:04:52.870
- Outrageous.
- That's what I paid.

01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:54.430
- Seventy-five.
-150.

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:56.550
80 and I'll do the dishes all month.

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:57.710
- Deal.
- Deal.

01:04:57.871 --> 01:04:58.910
- Fine.
- Fine.

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:07.910
- We need to talk.
- I think we do.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.990
There's something I need to say.

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:12.430
- Let's get married...
- You want out.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:16.150
Everyone's together
for the wrong reasons...

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:20.430
...or they bail out.
This is life telling us something.

01:05:20.671 --> 01:05:22.030
- Oh, God.
- What?

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:24.871
Don't make me remember
this chilidog.

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:29.430
Remember it. Make that
a historic chilidog.

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:32.749
Take your time. Think about it.

01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:39.030
You don't even have to use words,
just take a bite if the answer is yes.

01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.950
- I want to be logical.
- Okay.

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:47.668
Say we're married, we have the kid...

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:52.670
...will we be anything like we are now?
It's like the great unknown.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:57.109
I've got that coastal trip to Alaska,
and you've got your thing.

01:05:57.269 --> 01:06:02.310
I want to be logical. I think
I can love you and still be logical.

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:06.029
What? What is that look?

01:06:06.709 --> 01:06:11.430
Someone who really cares about you
must scare you to death.

01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:15.629
Forget logic.

01:06:16.909 --> 01:06:18.670
What's in your heart?

01:06:21.509 --> 01:06:24.228
I want to do it.

01:06:24.828 --> 01:06:28.108
- This is life telling us something.
- So that's a yes?

01:06:28.268 --> 01:06:30.868
Yes.

01:06:32.628 --> 01:06:35.949
- You're gonna feel good about this.
- Oh, really?

01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:42.508
Mom, I wanna get out!
Mom, can't we get out?

01:06:42.908 --> 01:06:46.269
- Did we make the right decision?
- I don't know.

01:06:46.428 --> 01:06:48.908
Please, Mom!

01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:50.109
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:51.308
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.668
Xavier McDaniel
made the All-Star team.

01:06:55.868 --> 01:06:58.507
- Why does he pick fights with players?
- Like?

01:06:58.708 --> 01:07:00.748
Like Charles Barkley.

01:07:00.988 --> 01:07:03.508
- That's a Bobby Van.
- Who's Bobby Van?

01:07:03.908 --> 01:07:06.828
He was the host of Make Me Laugh.

01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:13.588
I never got to finish
that chilidog, you know?

01:07:13.748 --> 01:07:16.947
That light's on yellow
way too long.

01:07:26.387 --> 01:07:28.628
You, okay?

01:07:29.907 --> 01:07:31.628
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

01:07:31.868 --> 01:07:33.747
Are you all right?

01:07:33.987 --> 01:07:37.027
Are you all right? Let's get out.

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:38.827
Come on, let's get out.

01:07:40.627 --> 01:07:42.626
James.

01:07:43.787 --> 01:07:45.308
James.

01:07:47.908 --> 01:07:52.027
- Who's James?
- I don't know.

01:07:52.907 --> 01:07:54.627
Honey?

01:07:54.947 --> 01:08:00.307
James Worthy is a star.
X is just a player.

01:08:00.867 --> 01:08:05.668
- This a conversation you had earlier?
- Yes.

01:08:05.827 --> 01:08:07.267
It's a good sign.

01:08:07.547 --> 01:08:10.947
- What?
- Hey.

01:08:11.186 --> 01:08:13.186
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:08:13.347 --> 01:08:16.987
We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospital.

01:08:22.787 --> 01:08:26.227
I lost it, right? It's all over.

01:08:29.587 --> 01:08:35.145
If we can't make it through this,
if you do not know you're not alone...

01:08:35.305 --> 01:08:39.346
- Linda?
- I lost the baby.

01:08:40.946 --> 01:08:42.666
Will you look at me?

01:08:47.024 --> 01:08:50.984
I was flunking high school,
overweight, had a dead-end job.

01:08:51.225 --> 01:08:55.904
I didn't feel good about myself.
My future did not look very bright...

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:57.066
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:08:57.225 --> 01:09:02.026
- How are you doing today?
- I'm better. I'm better.

01:09:02.185 --> 01:09:06.305
I think I've read every
single magazine in the world.

01:09:07.385 --> 01:09:11.104
- Did you go to work today?
- No. It's been two weeks.

01:09:11.265 --> 01:09:14.145
I think they're going to fire me.

01:09:17.505 --> 01:09:21.386
- I need some time alone.
- Alone?

01:09:21.546 --> 01:09:23.545
Yeah.

01:09:24.145 --> 01:09:28.545
I have a new emotion
every five seconds.

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:38.185
I think I should take
that research trip.

01:09:38.705 --> 01:09:44.743
I should just be out somewhere
in the middle of the ocean, alone.

01:09:45.104 --> 01:09:47.865
I know I'm right about this.

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:51.745
It's just a month. It's just work.

01:09:54.225 --> 01:09:55.746
See you in a month!

01:09:57.266 --> 01:09:59.744
I'll miss you!

01:10:06.304 --> 01:10:09.585
Hey, Janet. Come here.
I got a present for you.

01:10:10.345 --> 01:10:15.464
Give me another chance.
One, two minutes. Come on.

01:10:17.144 --> 01:10:20.584
- Hey. This'll be great.
- Oh.

01:10:20.744 --> 01:10:23.584
You're gonna love me for this.

01:10:28.945 --> 01:10:31.265
I installed your new stereo.

01:10:31.425 --> 01:10:35.703
Oh. Great.

01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:54.143
Yeah.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.544
Yeah.

01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:27.424
- I'll replace the windows.
- Thanks.

01:11:49.702 --> 01:11:54.824
Work. Work has never been better.

01:11:58.863 --> 01:12:01.183
I miss her.

01:12:05.262 --> 01:12:09.022
What are we going to say to each other
when she gets back?

01:12:24.022 --> 01:12:25.901
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome back.

01:12:26.061 --> 01:12:27.661
- You look great.
- You too.

01:12:27.902 --> 01:12:30.062
How are you? How was it?

01:12:30.222 --> 01:12:31.822
- It was really good.
- Yeah?

01:12:31.982 --> 01:12:33.182
Yeah, really good.

01:12:33.343 --> 01:12:36.503
- You want to go home? Out someplace?
- Whatever.

01:12:36.663 --> 01:12:42.221
- Let me think of the place...
- There's Costas, I guess, or whatever.

01:12:42.382 --> 01:12:47.022
- The 3-2-1? We could go... Or Costas...
- Whatever. I don't really care.

01:12:51.782 --> 01:12:57.861
Jesus. We both could sink
from all the pressure in the air.

01:12:58.103 --> 01:12:59.421
I know.

01:12:59.581 --> 01:13:03.821
- I really got into my job again.
- Me too. I was working my ass off.

01:13:04.062 --> 01:13:08.221
I had the Coast Guard working for us.
It was real exciting.

01:13:08.462 --> 01:13:10.541
That's great.

01:13:13.702 --> 01:13:16.460
We don't have to try and be
what we were.

01:13:17.901 --> 01:13:20.621
Thanks. I've been thinking
the same thing.

01:13:25.061 --> 01:13:27.261
Great.

01:13:28.461 --> 01:13:30.622
Friends.

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:37.060
Let's be the first people in history
to say it and really mean it.

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.741
How do you always say
the perfect thing?

01:13:54.620 --> 01:14:01.020
That obnoxious mime?
Was right. Love disappears.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:54.058
- Come on, man!
- Let's go!

01:14:54.219 --> 01:14:55.699
We got people out here!

01:14:55.939 --> 01:14:59.459
- Hello.
- I gotta go piss, man! Let's go!

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:05.699
Linda. It's me. I had to call you.

01:15:05.859 --> 01:15:09.299
It's about midnight. I was just
having many beers and...

01:15:09.459 --> 01:15:11.859
...I wanted to say...

01:15:12.779 --> 01:15:15.299
What I should have said at the dock.

01:15:15.459 --> 01:15:21.340
I fucking chickened out. I lied when
I acted casual, like Mr. Casual...

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.018
...and I should have said it.

01:15:24.539 --> 01:15:30.939
You belong with me!

01:15:32.699 --> 01:15:34.339
We belong together and...

01:15:34.579 --> 01:15:37.899
...and what really pissed me off
is that you thought...

01:15:38.139 --> 01:15:41.058
...I proposed only because
you were pregnant.

01:15:41.298 --> 01:15:43.178
I've got to go piss!

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:46.938
- I've got to go...
- Hey, this is not the bathroom!

01:15:47.098 --> 01:15:51.898
And maybe if I'd said this at the dock,
it would make a difference because...

01:15:52.058 --> 01:15:56.978
I think we made a big mistake because
we had good times and bad times...

01:15:57.138 --> 01:15:58.897
...but we had times.

01:15:59.137 --> 01:16:02.538
And I would like to start over.

01:16:02.697 --> 01:16:05.338
I would like to be new to you.

01:16:05.498 --> 01:16:09.379
I want to be new to you.
I want to be Mr. New...

01:16:09.538 --> 01:16:14.299
...so call me back if you want to,
but this is the last time I'll call.

01:16:17.978 --> 01:16:23.898
And if you really needed to know how
I really feel, that's it. I love you.

01:16:24.058 --> 01:16:27.618
And... That's something
you should know, so...

01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:39.178
I won't bother you again,
so good night and goodbye and...

01:16:39.336 --> 01:16:43.778
...I love you. Call me back. Goodbye.

01:17:02.097 --> 01:17:05.577
This thing just eats tapes.

01:17:15.496 --> 01:17:21.897
We're talking about 900,000 to
a million people by the time it's done.

01:17:22.097 --> 01:17:27.177
Provide an environment safer and better
than their cars. Why not, Mr. Mayor?

01:17:27.337 --> 01:17:31.536
- So it's a train.
- A supertrain.

01:17:31.695 --> 01:17:34.736
I've been burned by this
train business before.

01:17:34.897 --> 01:17:38.497
- You people all seem to forget.
- We can change this city.

01:17:38.656 --> 01:17:40.857
People love their cars.

01:17:42.817 --> 01:17:45.496
Yes. But...

01:17:45.656 --> 01:17:48.136
- But if you give them great...
- Coffee.

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:51.416
Coffee... And great music. If you...

01:17:51.655 --> 01:17:56.816
I'll put it to you like this, and then
I'll thank you for your time.

01:17:57.056 --> 01:17:58.656
My answer is...

01:18:00.016 --> 01:18:01.977
...no.

01:18:42.494 --> 01:18:43.855
Hi. May I help you?

01:18:44.175 --> 01:18:49.495
Ticket to Cabo San Lucas through Los
Angeles, first class, please. And...

01:18:52.535 --> 01:18:55.895
Could you seat me next to a single guy?

01:18:58.896 --> 01:19:01.854
I think I'll put you in seat 3C.

01:19:02.415 --> 01:19:04.615
Thank you.

01:19:08.375 --> 01:19:12.054
Tell me everything there is to know
about you.

01:19:12.615 --> 01:19:15.095
I've got a special feeling about you.

01:19:15.976 --> 01:19:19.534
Don't feel bad about her.
I'll tell you what happened.

01:19:19.694 --> 01:19:23.694
Kid talks her ear off the whole flight.
Dad picks him up.

01:19:23.855 --> 01:19:27.174
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.
His first words are:

01:19:27.494 --> 01:19:30.094
Look at those fantastic earrings.

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:36.973
And that's all it took.
Debbie was in love.

01:19:40.174 --> 01:19:41.654
Got back two weeks ago.

01:19:41.815 --> 01:19:45.253
He sends her the big basket every day.
Every third one...

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:49.454
...she sends back, just to be
mysterious. I don't know, games.

01:19:49.614 --> 01:19:51.655
He wants her to move to Mexico...

01:19:51.814 --> 01:19:56.133
...and if she gets a job at the TV
station down there, she's going.

01:20:02.813 --> 01:20:05.894
Oh, thanks.

01:20:09.015 --> 01:20:15.093
Tomorrow, I gotta spell her name in
rose petals. Do you believe this job?

01:20:43.933 --> 01:20:46.894
It's so easy to fall back into
old patterns.

01:20:47.053 --> 01:20:50.133
Back with Andy. One week
and we're already like...

01:20:50.292 --> 01:20:55.933
...one of those old couples, who sit
around in Denny's and don't speak.

01:20:56.092 --> 01:20:57.733
What am I doing?

01:20:57.893 --> 01:21:00.572
Why did I chicken out?

01:21:03.173 --> 01:21:04.533
Do you have the...?

01:21:10.572 --> 01:21:16.452
No, this is good. Being with Andy
is like being alone. Together.

01:21:17.573 --> 01:21:20.573
At least I'm not out there dating.

01:21:20.733 --> 01:21:25.251
- Love you.
- Love you too.

01:22:29.531 --> 01:22:31.971
- What?
- Hi.

01:22:32.211 --> 01:22:33.211
Hey.

01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:44.771
Hey. I was worried about you.

01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:50.251
I'm fine. I am great! Been working.
I read half of Exodus.

01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:53.491
Steve, I think you're
going through a phase.

01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:56.570
Do you realize, Janet,
that in modern society...

01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:01.771
...there is almost no need
to leave the house?

01:23:01.931 --> 01:23:04.251
- At all.
- Steve, you're wigging.

01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:08.770
I'm not wigging.
What, you think I'm wigging?

01:23:12.051 --> 01:23:17.330
This is hang time. I'm just...
I'm just regrouping.

01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:20.931
I'm spending some time with myself,
getting stronger.

01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:24.890
Thinking about... Regrouping.
I'm thinking about...

01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:30.689
...how I listened to my instincts, and
they were wrong. The opposite of right.

01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:35.450
Well, I just wanted to bring you
your mail.

01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:41.809
And maybe this isn't the right time
to share this with you, but...

01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:44.530
...things do turn around, Steve.

01:23:44.690 --> 01:23:48.369
I mean, I don't even think
about Cliff anymore.

01:23:48.609 --> 01:23:51.170
I'm having the best time,
on my terms.

01:23:51.329 --> 01:23:54.289
You know what else?
I'm going back to school.

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:56.169
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:23:56.569 --> 01:23:59.929
Got all my architecture classes.
My first project is...

01:24:00.089 --> 01:24:03.409
...redesigning the fountain so we
can sit in it.

01:24:03.650 --> 01:24:06.528
- That's good news.
- It is.

01:24:09.889 --> 01:24:14.848
People need people, Steve.
It's got nothing to do with sex.

01:24:15.289 --> 01:24:19.889
Maybe 40 percent. Sixty percent.
Forget it.

01:24:20.129 --> 01:24:21.889
Forget it.

01:24:22.129 --> 01:24:24.568
Tell you what.

01:24:24.729 --> 01:24:27.288
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...

01:24:27.448 --> 01:24:33.009
...something good and nice that I
want to share with you or something...

01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:35.928
I will knock four times, okay?

01:24:36.088 --> 01:24:40.808
It's gonna be our secret code.

01:24:40.969 --> 01:24:43.608
- How?
- Okay? What?

01:24:43.768 --> 01:24:44.848
- How?
- How what?

01:24:45.008 --> 01:24:46.968
How will you knock?

01:24:47.128 --> 01:24:48.969
Oh.

01:24:51.008 --> 01:24:54.449
Like that.

01:24:54.609 --> 01:24:56.689
Okay.

01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:02.567
Take care of yourself, Steve. Please.

01:25:18.727 --> 01:25:22.247
In a parallel universe,
we're probably a great couple.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:26.208
But in this one...

01:25:26.367 --> 01:25:27.607
Neighbors.

01:25:58.127 --> 01:25:59.967
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:26:00.127 --> 01:26:03.207
You get my message last night?
Because I called.

01:26:03.368 --> 01:26:04.367
I know.

01:26:05.287 --> 01:26:10.447
You know, I didn't appreciate you,
even though I thought I did.

01:26:14.766 --> 01:26:20.287
I used to live out by the airport,
underneath the flight patterns.

01:26:20.447 --> 01:26:24.447
It was really noisy with the planes
going by all day.

01:26:24.607 --> 01:26:28.967
I used to have cookouts, and no one
would come because of the noise.

01:26:29.367 --> 01:26:33.206
I got used to it.
And then, when I moved...

01:26:33.366 --> 01:26:36.286
...I missed the noise.
I missed those planes.

01:26:39.406 --> 01:26:43.326
- Cliff, what are you talking about?
- I don't know.

01:26:45.047 --> 01:26:49.886
I miss you. The way
you used to look at me...

01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:54.087
- Don't. I'm finally over you.
- Really?

01:26:54.326 --> 01:26:59.967
Yeah. I mean, you know, I still really
do like you, you know?

01:27:00.366 --> 01:27:03.047
I think you're very...

01:27:03.806 --> 01:27:05.286
What?

01:27:05.967 --> 01:27:06.965
Entertaining.

01:27:10.645 --> 01:27:13.286
That's me. I gotta go.
My break's over.

01:27:14.686 --> 01:27:17.085
Janet, you rock my world.

01:28:09.925 --> 01:28:14.925
I'm walking down the avenue

01:28:19.005 --> 01:28:23.484
And I'm looking at the garbage cans

01:28:26.484 --> 01:28:31.285
I'm laughing at the people I see

01:28:31.764 --> 01:28:37.644
Something like that. I'm playing
with the lyrics. It's not set in stone.

01:28:37.804 --> 01:28:41.484
Give me a call. I don't know
what you're doing tonight...

01:28:41.645 --> 01:28:44.044
...but give me a call, huh?

01:28:47.085 --> 01:28:50.965
Talk to me, talk to me.
40 résumés, bring me back something.

01:28:51.204 --> 01:28:53.364
Here we go.

01:29:14.363 --> 01:29:16.443
Hi.

01:29:16.603 --> 01:29:19.963
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

01:29:23.923 --> 01:29:28.244
I don't need to be your girlfriend.
I just want to know you again.

01:29:31.044 --> 01:29:32.603
What took you so long?

01:29:34.723 --> 01:29:36.403
I was stuck in traffic.

01:30:26.562 --> 01:30:30.642
Well, that's the way it happens.
Steve's moving out tomorrow.

01:30:30.802 --> 01:30:32.961
They're finding a place,
and I'm happy for them.

01:30:33.122 --> 01:30:36.882
- Coming down. Look out.
- No problem.

01:30:37.042 --> 01:30:42.603
I may live here forever. That's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.

01:30:42.763 --> 01:30:46.121
For a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.

01:30:46.282 --> 01:30:51.042
Not for me.
My music is all the juice I'll need.

01:30:51.202 --> 01:30:56.162
I'm a self-contained unit.
I'm a solo artist.

01:30:56.322 --> 01:30:59.722
Well, I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.

01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:10.481
- Hey.
- Hey. Going out?

01:31:10.641 --> 01:31:14.642
- Yep. You?
- Yeah.

01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:20.440
That's a very nice hat, and I don't mean
that in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.

01:31:20.601 --> 01:31:22.921
Thanks.

01:31:26.721 --> 01:31:29.881
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.401
Does everybody go through this?

01:31:51.561 --> 01:31:54.601
No, I think, just us.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.721
I'm going to be celibate forever.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.600
I could spend my life with that person.

01:31:59.761 --> 01:32:02.681
- All you see is her head, Tommy.
- I know my type.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:06.281
- Met someone new today.
- She's more my type than yours.

01:32:06.441 --> 01:32:10.481
- You always say they're your type.
- Tell me I'm not like Shelly.

01:32:10.641 --> 01:32:13.521
- She should try living alone...
- It took two dates...

01:32:13.681 --> 01:32:16.240
Hi, it's me. I just thought I'd call...

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:21.400
- You said that I said...
- I don't play games.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:25.160
I can't believe I feel this way!
