WEBVTT

00:02.302 --> 00:04.077
Is the coast clear?
What are you wearing?

00:04.137 --> 00:06.242
My sneak-around clothes.
Is he gone?

00:06.306 --> 00:08.411
Yeah, he's gone. Come in.
You got to see this.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.751
Tom and I have been seeing
each other for a few weeks,

00:10.810 --> 00:14.019
and I think I'm ready
to say I love you

00:14.647 --> 00:15.682
to his apartment.

00:15.749 --> 00:19.424
I love you so much.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.495
Look at all
these blankets.

00:21.554 --> 00:25.001
One on the ottoman, one on
the chair, one on the couch.

00:25.091 --> 00:26.195
Here. Feel.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.738
Holy hell, that's soft.

00:28.628 --> 00:29.800
Oh, my God. Is that...

00:29.863 --> 00:32.104
Yeah. A whole shelf
of coconut water.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.441
I think I'm going to cry
This is like girl heaven.

00:34.501 --> 00:35.912
Did he do all of
this just for you?

00:35.969 --> 00:37.505
No, he just
lives like this.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.777
He's deeply in debt. But you know what?
Who cares?

00:39.839 --> 00:43.412
Because check it out. A cheese
plate and Adriatic figs.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.717
Leslie, this is
always here.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.417
I don't know when
he has time to make it.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.690
Boutique eye cream. Unisex cologne.
Lip exfoliator.

00:51.751 --> 00:54.027
Chocolate covered almonds
and a sudoku book.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.760
Just amenities everywhere.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.529
I love amenities.
I know!

00:57.590 --> 00:59.126
Check this out.
This is the best part.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.762
Eighty degrees,
night and day.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.700
Look at this one.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.765
There's another soft one.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.643
Ohhh!

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.056 --> 01:31.967
Councilman Pillner,
could I have a moment?

01:32.025 --> 01:33.095
Make it quick.

01:33.159 --> 01:36.902
In his seminal 2009 documentary,
filmmaker Ken Burns

01:36.963 --> 01:40.308
describes the national parks
system as America's best idea.

01:40.366 --> 01:41.538
Way quicker.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.480
Okay. Well, but you should
watch that documentary.

01:44.637 --> 01:47.083
Now, I realize that you're
drafting the new city budget,

01:47.140 --> 01:48.312
and I've heard
that you're planning

01:48.374 --> 01:50.786
on reducing
the Parks funding by 8%.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.781
Councilman Pillner,
that cannot happen.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.724
I've gotten to know
the city councilmen

01:55.782 --> 01:57.625
pretty well because
of my campaign.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.320
If you hear any
of them talking about

01:59.385 --> 02:02.559
that blonde pain in
the ass, that's me.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.103
Leslie, that budget
is all but finalized.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.104
I love building
ships in bottles.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.271
When the ship is done,
I put a cork in it,

02:10.330 --> 02:11.707
put it on the shelf,
and I move on.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.175
Hold that cork, sir.

02:13.233 --> 02:17.238
Because I am about to put an
adorable face on your proposed cuts.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.249
Meet Melodi Sternway.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.979
She is enrolled in five
of our Parks programs.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.453
Our department is
the only thing between her

02:24.511 --> 02:28.015
and a life of tube tops
and tribal tattoos

02:28.081 --> 02:29.651
and barfing in hot tubs.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.955
Please.
Okay. You got me.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.327
I'll find the cuts
somewhere else.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.008
Good morning, everyone.
I'm April Ludgate,

02:44.063 --> 02:47.875
and I will be filling in for
Leslie while she runs for office.

02:48.801 --> 02:52.715
So, the new emergency protocol
for the Parks Department

02:52.772 --> 02:55.309
can be found
in your binders.

02:55.375 --> 02:59.380
What exactly is the chain of
command, vis-3-vis on-site response?

03:00.079 --> 03:01.888
You know what?
Why don't we just say

03:01.948 --> 03:05.327
that whoever gets to the emergency
first will be in charge?

03:05.418 --> 03:08.922
Okay. So, if there's an
explosion, say, in Ramsett Park

03:08.988 --> 03:12.936
and someone from Sewage gets there
first, they'd be in charge?

03:13.459 --> 03:16.133
I had no idea how
terrible Leslie's job is.

03:16.362 --> 03:20.003
She referred to this meeting
as a non-stop thrill ride.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.545
I'm not quite sure, but
Tom can answer that if...

03:25.638 --> 03:26.708
What are you doing?

03:26.773 --> 03:28.116
Just bouncing
some business ideas

03:28.174 --> 03:30.780
off Russell Simmons
on Twitter. Why?

03:31.211 --> 03:34.124
All due respect, Ms. Ludgate, do you
even know what you're doing here?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.661
All due respect, Mr. Hamsterpenis,
but no, I don't.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.128
My last name is Giles.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.825
Are you sure? Because you
look like a Hamsterpenis.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.969
What about a cologne
that can kill spiders?

03:45.558 --> 03:48.471
Ron Swanson, it is my
pleasure to inform you

03:48.561 --> 03:52.407
that you are a finalist for the
job of Assistant City Manager.

03:52.665 --> 03:54.406
Chris, I feel
I should remind you

03:54.467 --> 03:56.344
that I do not believe
that the position

03:56.402 --> 03:58.678
or the entire government
should exist.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.680
That said, you'd be
a fool not to pick me.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.347
I will walk deeper into
the belly of the beast,

04:04.444 --> 04:07.857
if it means I'm able to further
limit reckless government spending.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.121
I mean, I have
so many ideas.

04:10.450 --> 04:15.263
Some are simple, like take down traffic
lights and eliminate the post office.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.332
The bigger ones
will be tougher, like,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.401
bring all of this
crumbling to the ground.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.895
There is one more step
in the vetting process.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.773
You and I will embark on a quick
session of heart-rate meditation,

04:27.033 --> 04:30.207
focusing on conscious breathing
and opening the heart chakra.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.846
I'm not sure
I'm interested in that.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.249
No, I am sure. I am not
interested in that.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.221
Ron, you and I are
very different people.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.756
And we have often
been at odds.

04:39.879 --> 04:43.486
It is crucial that you and I
spend a day spiritually engaged.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.551
And consider what it would
really mean to work together.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.427
Trust me, you'll love it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:47.487 --> 04:49.433
Oh! Wear your yoga pants.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.297
Okay, I really wish we would
have talked about this first.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.929
What could possibly
be wrong about me

04:54.994 --> 04:56.496
saving the
Parks Department budget?

04:56.562 --> 04:58.872
I don't know.
That's the point.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.272
You're thinking like
a Parks Department employee,

05:01.334 --> 05:03.041
not a City Council
candidate.

05:03.102 --> 05:04.342
You're in a campaign.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.111
Literally everything you
do right now is politics.

05:06.172 --> 05:08.413
Oh, really? Is this politics?
Ow!

05:08.541 --> 05:11.545
What is that?
Why did you do that?

05:11.611 --> 05:14.854
I'm in a good mood because a
city councilor listened to me.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.291
That means
I have some juice.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.625
Look, this might be
a good thing.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.564
But there's a reason we strategize
before we make decisions.

05:21.621 --> 05:22.998
Okay- okay-

05:23.056 --> 05:25.400
I'll make some calls,
see where we are.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.698
Enjoying the view.

05:26.759 --> 05:27.965
What is going on?

05:28.294 --> 05:31.366
I'm just really into you.
Give me a spin, baby.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.667
I hate
doing Leslie's job.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.111
I'm filling in for a person
who smiles 90% of the time.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.743
Tom, can you please help me?
Please? Or just do it?

05:39.806 --> 05:42.116
Come on, little sparkle.
Don't give up.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.483
What does Leslie
always say?

05:43.543 --> 05:45.648
I don't know. Weird
stuff about waffles?

05:45.712 --> 05:48.420
She says you get out of a
job what you put into it.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.654
You just need to find a project
you're passionate about.

05:50.717 --> 05:53.721
For instance, I was incredible at
naming drinks at the Snakehole Lounge,

05:53.786 --> 05:56.323
because I care a great deal
about signature beverages.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.500
The Beer-yonce Knowles.

05:58.725 --> 06:01.262
It's just a regular beer, but
we put it in a sexy-ass mug.

06:01.327 --> 06:03.102
Pairs nicely
with the Jay-Zima.

06:03.162 --> 06:05.164
We bought a bunch of Zima
when the factory shut down.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.039
That sounds fun. Maybe I
should work at a bar.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.946
Come on. There must be some aspect
of this job you care about.

06:11.971 --> 06:15.384
Hello. Here are some
papers Leslie requested.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.620
These are blank.
Weird.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.885
As long as I'm here,
can I ask you a question?

06:21.381 --> 06:24.794
Did you ever participate
in meditation with Chris?

06:24.884 --> 06:27.922
Oh, yeah. When we dated,
he made me do it every week.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.461
What am I in for here?

06:29.522 --> 06:30.762
Okay,
here's the deal.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.869
It's crazy boring.
It lasts forever.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.268
You're going to
wish you were dead.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.438
Do you want to borrow
my yoga pants?

06:40.366 --> 06:43.745
Hey. So did Pillner finalize the budget?
Are we okay?

06:43.803 --> 06:45.282
We are the
opposite of okay.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.408
What do you mean?

06:46.472 --> 06:47.712
To keep the money
in Parks,

06:47.774 --> 06:49.879
they're going to shut down
the Westside Animal Shelter.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.353
The money had to
come from somewhere,

06:51.411 --> 06:53.118
and the shelter
is on its last legs.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.420
So they're closing it
at the end of the week.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.960
That's where
Champion came from.

06:57.016 --> 06:58.324
What will happen to
all the other animals?

06:58.384 --> 07:00.125
Well, they'll be...

07:00.253 --> 07:01.357
Fine.
No,

07:01.421 --> 07:02.456
they'll be...

07:04.791 --> 07:06.828
- No.
- Guys?

07:07.026 --> 07:10.701
Apparently, Leslie Knope
wielded her insider influence

07:10.763 --> 07:14.336
and got Councilman Pillner to
save her precious department,

07:14.400 --> 07:16.676
even though it meant
closing the shelter.

07:16.736 --> 07:20.445
<i>Now, I am not saying that Leslie
Knope is</i> a <i>dog murderer, per se</i>

07:20.506 --> 07:22.577
I just think that her actions
raise some questions.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.212
Like, for example,
is she a dog murderer?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.416
Oh, God.

07:26.479 --> 07:27.981
Well, I don't know the
answer to that, Jennifer,

07:28.047 --> 07:30.891
but your tone
makes me think, yes.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.695
Say
your goodbyes, Pebble.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.824
Because
Leslie Knope going to kill you.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.430
She got the perfect puppy
for that shot. She is good.

07:40.493 --> 07:41.972
Leslie, there is
a woman on the phone

07:42.028 --> 07:43.632
that says her daughter
is scared to go to sleep

07:43.696 --> 07:47.200
because Leslie Knope's going
to come murder her kitty.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.704
Okay, we can fix this.

07:48.768 --> 07:49.838
Yes, we can.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.812
Tomorrow morning, we are
going back to Pillner

07:51.871 --> 07:53.646
and telling him to
cut the Parks budget.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.880
No, no, no, no. We can
figure something else out.

08:06.786 --> 08:07.992
Leslie?

08:08.387 --> 08:10.367
Hey, honey. Good morning.
How did you sleep?

08:10.423 --> 08:11.959
I adopted 32 cats and dogs.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.594
Do you want pancakes?
I'm going to make pancakes.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.070
- Is that a pig?
- What? Which one?

08:15.127 --> 08:16.834
Is that a pig? Are you
talking about this one?

08:16.896 --> 08:19.877
This one right here?
Yes, that is a pig.

08:24.403 --> 08:27.316
This is the best meditation
center in the area.

08:27.673 --> 08:28.811
It doesn't look like much.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.856
Oh, actually, this strip mall
has surprisingly decent chi.

08:31.911 --> 08:35.552
Although the smells from the Greek
restaurant next door are not ideal.

08:35.715 --> 08:40.424
But through this door lies
a deep, serene quietude.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.834
Excuse me, ladies.
On your right.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.839
Now, take in
the vibe of the room

08:51.297 --> 08:54.039
and remain open
of mind and of spirit.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.138
Now, quietly, sit behind
me, and let's join breath.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.413
I'll stand.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.747
Interesting technique.

09:12.351 --> 09:15.696
Andy, look at this little guy.
He's such a little runt.

09:15.755 --> 09:16.756
Hey there.

09:16.822 --> 09:17.892
Hey, Tom, look.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.862
Oh, I just had five
cats on me at once.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.565
You want to come in here
and try to break my record?

09:22.628 --> 09:24.801
That's okay, Andy. I think I'm
going to keep my distance.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.409
Don't want none of
that animal dander

09:26.465 --> 09:28.376
interacting
with this cashmere.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.338
What's your endgame
here, my dear?

09:30.403 --> 09:33.441
This is only temporary until I
find away to keep the shelter open

09:33.506 --> 09:34.780
without cutting
the Parks budget.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.820
Hey, what if I threw
together a pet adoption

09:36.876 --> 09:38.753
in one of our parks?
Would that be cool?

09:38.811 --> 09:40.256
April, that would
be the coolest thing

09:40.313 --> 09:44.056
since *NSYNC, Aerosmith and
Nelly performed together

09:44.116 --> 09:46.426
at the Super Bowl halftime show.
Ew!

09:46.485 --> 09:50.228
I think I may have found a project
I'd actually enjoy doing.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.597
Helping these
cats and dogs.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.899
They should be rewarded
for not being people.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.763
I hate people.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.808
I'm very proud
of you, April.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.504
Meanwhile, you and I are going
to look at the town budget,

10:01.567 --> 10:03.945
and we're going to find
something expendable.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.643
Hey, Ben. The pig ate your
noise canceling headphones.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.144
Pigs are awesome.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.190
All told, we were
in there about six hours.

10:14.747 --> 10:19.162
And no, I was not meditating. I just
stood there, quietly breathing.

10:19.719 --> 10:23.724
There were no thoughts in my head whatsoever.
My mind was blank.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.769
I don't know what the hell these
other crackpots are doing.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.275
Jerry, the puppies are going
to the bathroom everywhere.

10:32.331 --> 10:33.435
We can't let
people see that.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.843
I need you to continuously
clean out the cages. Okay?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.606
You got it, boss.
Thank you.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.014
Donna, did you put the info
sheets on all the cages?

10:40.072 --> 10:41.073
Last one.
Great.

10:41.140 --> 10:45.088
Each animal has a photo, special
talents and a personal history.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.680
That I made up.

10:46.779 --> 10:50.022
A lot of these dogs have rescued
people from burning buildings.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.153
This one helped
Ray Charles around.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.094
What? This cat was
in Boogie Nights?

10:56.389 --> 10:57.697
Hi.You like
this little guy?

10:57.757 --> 10:58.827
He's so cute.

10:58.891 --> 11:02.031
I know. All of the animals
are up to date on their shots.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.596
And I think
he likes you.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.835
He's pretty awesome.

11:04.897 --> 11:07.935
Did you know his great-grandfather
was Spuds MacKenzie?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.840
What do you think, sweetie?
You want to take him home?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.381
Yes, please.

11:13.973 --> 11:18.251
Realistically, I'm guessing we dropped
three to five points in the polls.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.916
This late in the game,
it's a killer.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.984
And that's
a dog biscuit.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.823
Andy put them on the table
because he wanted to try

11:24.884 --> 11:26.591
to have the dogs
play poker.

11:26.652 --> 11:29.861
Okay. Leslie, we are out of time.
We have to go back to them.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.833
Oh, my God.
This is it.

11:34.894 --> 11:35.929
Hmm.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.575
Oh, for
God's sake, Leslie.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.407
There’s just not enough money to
do all the things you want to do.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.140
You're trying to fit
two ships into one bottle.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.807
And take it from me, you can't do that.

11:46.305 --> 11:47.943
Okay, just look at this.

11:48.007 --> 11:52.217
There are three employees
designated as D-1 or on retainer.

11:52.478 --> 11:53.582
Public Works is
still paying them,

11:53.646 --> 11:55.216
even though they haven't
worked in two years.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.319
It's an oversight. We get rid of
them and we have just enough money

11:58.384 --> 11:59.886
to keep the animal
shelter operating

11:59.952 --> 12:02.592
while still maintaining
the Parks budget.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.690
Interesting.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.201
Looks like we found
a bigger bottle.

12:05.257 --> 12:08.101
I know you're just making a
joke but using a bigger bottle

12:08.160 --> 12:12.666
would be considered cheating by most
of our major trade publications. FYI.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.643
Ron, you radiated
mindfulness.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.139
What were you
thinking about?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.909
I wasn't thinking at all.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.281
Incredible.
It takes a ton of work

12:21.340 --> 12:23.411
for me to get to that kind
of a clear head space,

12:23.476 --> 12:25.251
no matter how hard I try.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.984
Don't try so hard.

12:27.179 --> 12:30.251
"Don't try so hard."

12:30.516 --> 12:34.054
Ron, I'm going to try your not
trying method right here, right now.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.931
Chris, wait.

12:36.522 --> 12:40.060
I know this crap is important
to you, so I should come clean.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.470
I got nothing out of
that experience at all.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.967
So, if you're looking for someone
who enjoys meditation...

12:45.030 --> 12:46.737
Oh, I didn't expect
you to enjoy it.

12:46.799 --> 12:51.248
My one reservation about you as a
co-worker was that you seem inflexible.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.577
And merely by agreeing to an
activity you're not interested in,

12:54.840 --> 12:56.751
you showed flexibility.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.856
Ron, you've got the job.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.883
You want to head back?
I do.

13:01.947 --> 13:05.656
But first, there's a hot,
spinning cone of meat

13:05.718 --> 13:07.891
in that Greek restaurant
next door.

13:07.953 --> 13:11.696
I don't know what it is, but I'd
like to eat the whole thing.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.730
Why is it so dead?
Where is everyone?

13:14.927 --> 13:16.634
Don't give up yet. There's
a few minutes left.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.107
Is this where we drop
off our unwanted cats?

13:19.265 --> 13:20.539
No. It's the opposite.

13:20.599 --> 13:24.103
Okay. I'm just going to put
these here for a second.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.847
And then...

13:28.741 --> 13:30.778
We ended up with more animals
than we started with.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.447
This is what happens
when you try.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.422
All of these animals
are going to die.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.623
God. I hope you're happy, stupid
people in this stupid town.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.127
Hey! Hey, you!

13:42.054 --> 13:44.864
Get back here and get your
 cats out of here.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.327
Do you think Barack
and Michelle Obama

13:47.393 --> 13:48.895
feel like this at
the end of the day?

13:48.961 --> 13:50.941
Probably. I mean,
I don't know. How else...

13:50.996 --> 13:52.942
Wait a second, is that...

13:52.998 --> 13:54.409
So, am I Michelle?

13:54.466 --> 13:56.844
Hey. How is everyone?

13:56.902 --> 13:58.142
Great.
Pretty good.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.741
We saved the animal shelter
and the Parks budget.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.410
That's great news.
Let me guess.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.920
You found room in other parts
of the budget somewhere?

14:04.977 --> 14:08.720
Totally. Got rid of a bunch of
lame-ass D-1s from Public Works.

14:08.814 --> 14:11.624
Awesome news. Hey,
you know what else is pretty neat,

14:11.784 --> 14:15.095
is thanks to you, Councilman
Pillner went through the budget

14:15.187 --> 14:17.030
and decided that
not just Public Works

14:17.089 --> 14:19.365
but all D-1's will be
terminated in two weeks.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.963
I'm getting fired.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.198
But what, now?

14:24.797 --> 14:27.300
Oh! Councilman Howser. l
was just looking for you.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.438
I have found my
Assistant City Manager.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.071
You want to guess who it is?
It's Ron Swanson.

14:31.136 --> 14:34.015
I'm sorry. I should have let you guess.
I'm just so excited.

14:34.306 --> 14:35.444
I'd put a pin
in this for now.

14:35.507 --> 14:36.577
Why? Why pin it?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.112
The council vote
is three to two

14:39.178 --> 14:40.657
in favor of
another term for you.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.715
But one of the yes votes
is retiring.

14:42.781 --> 14:45.421
If Bobby Newport wins, he is going
to try to bring in his own guy.

14:45.484 --> 14:46.554
Why would he do that?

14:46.619 --> 14:48.496
He's not exactly thrilled
you've been volunteering

14:48.554 --> 14:50.864
for the Knope campaign
in your spare time.

14:50.923 --> 14:54.029
Sorry, Chris. If Newport
wins, you're gone.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.532
I just need one more week.
And then, I think...

14:59.598 --> 15:02.010
Sorry. Could you
please be careful?

15:02.067 --> 15:04.104
Oh, I am always careful.

15:06.639 --> 15:07.640
We're good.

15:07.706 --> 15:09.447
If I could just get
a little bit more time,

15:09.508 --> 15:11.181
I could figure out
how to fix this.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.484
Unfortunately, I cannot
give you any more time.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.888
With due respect...
Leslie, I am retiring

15:14.947 --> 15:15.982
at the end of this term.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.685
So I've been fine
with you guys

15:17.750 --> 15:19.320
pushing me around
on this budget thing.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.922
But if you're ever
going to hold this job

15:22.021 --> 15:23.694
there's something
you need to understand.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.703
City council isn't about making
everybody in town happy.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.204
In fact,
every decision you make

15:28.260 --> 15:31.264
is going to make a lot
of people very unhappy.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.910
We play with
live ammo around here.

15:34.566 --> 15:37.012
Now, I'm going to close the
book on this budget draft

15:37.069 --> 15:38.412
by the end of
the business day.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.743
So if you can find some
way out of this mess

15:40.806 --> 15:42.786
by 5:00 p.m.,
you let me know.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.218
Thank you.
That's fair.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.187
I did it. I got it out.

15:46.512 --> 15:49.083
Oh, geez. You don't
take the ship out.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.385
Here you go.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.490
Chris. Great news.

15:55.888 --> 15:59.358
I've found a way to reduce
government spending by 85%.

15:59.725 --> 16:02.729
Here's a hint. No more departments.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.605
That crazy and impractical
plan may have to wait.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.974
Turns out that Bobby
Newport, if he beats Leslie,

16:08.033 --> 16:09.842
is going to appoint
his own city manager.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.074
Sol may have
offered you

16:11.136 --> 16:14.049
a job that I have
no authority to offer.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.380
I'm so, so sorry.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.921
Well, that is disappointing.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.389
But don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

16:20.446 --> 16:23.484
Oh, I know. I mean, in the grand
scheme of things, who cares?

16:23.716 --> 16:25.195
We're all just molecules

16:25.250 --> 16:28.993
floating around in random
patterns, devoid of meaning.

16:30.456 --> 16:33.926
Well, I'll see you when I see you.
I'm a rolling stone.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.900
Peace.
Stop.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.133
Have a seat.

16:38.197 --> 16:41.770
We did things your way Now,
we're going to do it my way.

16:42.368 --> 16:45.372
Prepare to experience
true freedom and bliss.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.444
Maybe I should just go
back to being a nurse full-time.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.851
No. I will not let you return
to a life of shaving wieners

16:51.910 --> 16:53.981
and dodging knife attacks
from meth heads.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.251
Right. Okay. What are
you going to do?

16:57.316 --> 17:00.695
Well, either you get fired,
the Parks budget shrinks,

17:00.919 --> 17:02.262
or the animal shelter
has got to go.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.766
Or we find money
somewhere else.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.858
Okay, Leslie,
there is nowhere else.

17:05.924 --> 17:09.497
This is a town budget, not a
bottomless trust fund. Okay?

17:10.295 --> 17:12.332
I mean, money doesn't just appear...
Shh! Stop talking.

17:12.397 --> 17:13.468
What?
Shh!

17:13.632 --> 17:15.907
I have half an idea
and I'm putting it together.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.002
Okay-
HEY-

17:17.069 --> 17:18.069
Do you want to...
Hey.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.137
I'm...
No.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.773
Do you...
Ann. Shh.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.914
Okay, now, I have
a complete idea.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.888
Ben, I'm going to commit
political suicide.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.725
Hey, it's me, Tommy.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.832
Hi.
I'm not here.

17:36.889 --> 17:37.890
April?

17:37.956 --> 17:40.232
I swear on my great-great-grandmother's
grave. I'm not here.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.704
I'm going to come in for a second.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.672
Will you just
leave me alone?

17:44.730 --> 17:46.368
Why so glum, sugar plum?

17:47.399 --> 17:49.242
I don't know. Maybe
because I worked so hard

17:49.301 --> 17:51.872
on that dumb pet
adoption and I failed.

17:51.937 --> 17:53.746
That's why it's stupid
to work hard.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.080
Let me show you something.

17:55.140 --> 17:59.452
Because you worked hard, this little
terribly-dressed girl has a puppy,

17:59.778 --> 18:02.190
and this little puppy
has a home.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.783
And if Leslie has
taught me anything,

18:03.849 --> 18:06.159
it's that, yes,
98% of the time,

18:06.218 --> 18:09.290
this job is frustrating
and you hit brick walls.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.699
But the other 2%?
It's stuff like this kid.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.028
And that PUPPY-

18:15.594 --> 18:17.164
What? What is that photo?

18:17.563 --> 18:19.474
That must come pre-loaded
in there or something.

18:19.531 --> 18:20.635
Oh, my God.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.178
See you at work tomorrow?

18:22.668 --> 18:24.011
Fine.
All right.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.377
Bye, pups.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.541
Bye, little piggies

18:28.574 --> 18:31.885
I don't usually poison my
body with dark alcohol,

18:31.977 --> 18:34.685
but this whiskey
is excellent.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.459
Nectar of the gods.

18:37.149 --> 18:40.892
Well, I should get back to my
office, as long as I have one.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.162
Chris, I'm not one
for positive thinking

18:44.223 --> 18:46.567
or visualization
or meditation

18:46.625 --> 18:48.935
or really anything in the
world that you believe in.

18:49.361 --> 18:52.399
But you might consider the
upside of losing your job.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.433
For example?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.639
You would no longer be
a government parasite,

18:56.735 --> 18:59.682
sucking the lifeblood from
honest, hardworking people.

19:00.072 --> 19:03.519
Instead, you'd contribute
to society like a man.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.950
That's just one way
it might be good.

19:06.011 --> 19:08.048
I'm sure there are others.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.456
I'm sure there are.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.423
Uh-oh!

19:15.654 --> 19:17.725
You look serious.
What's on the agenda?

19:17.789 --> 19:19.291
Just one item, Jennifer.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.860
You are going to announce
that Bobby Newport

19:20.926 --> 19:23.566
will use his personal fortune
to save the animal shelter.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.973
No. No, that's...

19:26.832 --> 19:27.833
That's...

19:29.735 --> 19:30.770
That is a great idea.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.146
In fact, I don't know why I
hadn't thought of it already.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.843
Damn it. Damn it.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.447
I swear, the air in this town
is killing my brain cells.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.886
Actually, the water is not
good for you, either.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.322
You shouldn't drink the tap water.
Has anyone told you that yet?

19:41.380 --> 19:45.328
In exchange, no more puppy killer
ads for the rest of the campaign.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.261
That's all we ask.
Okay.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.162
Well, what's to
stop me from just paying

19:49.221 --> 19:50.529
for the shelter and
still running the ads?

19:50.589 --> 19:51.932
Because I told
Councilman Pillner

19:51.990 --> 19:53.298
that if you don't
agree to our terms,

19:53.392 --> 19:54.598
he should cut
the Parks budget.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.967
And we'll leak that it
was Leslie's decision,

19:57.029 --> 19:59.236
making her seem
tough and fair,

19:59.298 --> 20:01.608
what with sacrificing
her old department.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.772
Okay. What's
in it for you?

20:03.936 --> 20:07.816
A safe home for the animals, a job for
my friend, and a full Parks budget.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.319
I wasn't born yesterday.
You've got to have an angle.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.649
This is a home run for us.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.417
We're going to dominate the
news cycle for a whole week.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.049
Well, you can have this week.
We'll take the next one.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.025
Oh, yeah? What
makes you so sure?

20:18.116 --> 20:20.596
Because in a week,
we have a debate.

20:20.652 --> 20:23.292
And your guy, Bobby Newport,
is going to have to show up

20:23.355 --> 20:25.665
and he's going to
have to open his mouth.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.000
And I'm going
to kick his ass.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.140
She'll take care of that.
See you next week.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.871
How's my best buddy?
I just bought this.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.643
Cranium. It's a board game.
Have you heard of it?

20:39.705 --> 20:42.208
It is literally the most
fun I have ever had.

20:42.274 --> 20:45.255
What do you say after work, you,
me, whiskey, wheatgrass, Cranium?

20:46.478 --> 20:48.185
Ron?
Chris?

20:48.247 --> 20:49.920
Sorry, he's meditating.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.195
He asked me to tell
anyone who comes in

20:52.284 --> 20:54.491
that he wishes to
remain undisturbed,

20:54.553 --> 20:56.965
so as to better clarify
his head space.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.996
Oh, God, Ron. lam so sorry.
I'll let you get at it.
