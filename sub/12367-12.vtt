WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.212
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.295 --> 00:06.131
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.214 --> 00:08.591
- OH, GOOD,
JOY, YOU'RE HERE.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.927
WOULD YOU MIND
HELPING ME FOR A SECOND?

00:11.010 --> 00:12.929
- SURE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:13.012 --> 00:15.056
- JUST RAISE YOUR HAND.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.891
LIKE YOU'RE
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

00:18.643 --> 00:19.769
PERFECT.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.230
ATTACK!

00:22.313 --> 00:23.606
- ELKA!

00:23.690 --> 00:24.941
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:25.024 --> 00:26.234
- SHE'S TRYING TO GET DUMMY
TO ATTACK ME

00:26.317 --> 00:28.445
- [laughs] OH, THAT'S NOT
HIS NAME ANYMORE.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.904
IT'S CHANCE.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.406
ELKA THOUGHT THE NAME DUMMY
WAS HOLDING HIM BACK.

00:31.489 --> 00:34.492
- WHY ARE YOU TRAINING HIM
TO ATTACK PEOPLE?

00:34.576 --> 00:38.955
- FOR CHURCH.

00:39.038 --> 00:40.623
- ATTENDANCE HAS BEEN DOWN,

00:40.707 --> 00:42.083
SO THE PASTOR CAME UP
WITH THIS GREAT IDEA

00:42.167 --> 00:43.793
TO GET PEOPLE IN THE PEWS.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.503
BIBLE STORIES
TOLD THROUGH PETS.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.797
- CHANCE IS AUDITIONING
FOR DAVID

00:47.881 --> 00:50.800
IN "DAVID AND GOLIATH."

00:50.884 --> 00:52.761
IF YOU CAN'T JUMP,

00:52.844 --> 00:55.263
THEY'RE JUST GONNA MAKE YOU
ANOTHER SHEEP IN THE MANGER.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.973
- OH, GIVE IT UP.

00:57.056 --> 00:57.974
YOU CAN'T EVEN
GET HIM TO SIT.

00:58.057 --> 01:00.477
- YES, I CAN.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.478
SIT.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.812
SIT.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.527
IN THE KITCHEN!
GOOD BOY!

01:09.611 --> 01:12.906
START MEASURING HIM
FOR WOOL.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.325
HI, GUYS.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.076
YEAH, I WAS JUST THINKING.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.162
ISN'T IT GREAT
THAT WE'RE THE KIND OF FRIENDS

01:19.245 --> 01:21.039
WHO CAN TELL EACH OTHER
ANYTHING?

01:21.122 --> 01:23.333
YOU KNOW, WITHOUT ANY JUDGMENT
OR RECRIMINATIONS.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.503
JUST LOVE AND...
FORGIVENESS.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.130
- WHICH ONE OF US
SHOULD BE NERVOUS RIGHT NOW?

01:29.214 --> 01:31.674
- NOBODY, NOBODY.
[chuckles]

01:31.758 --> 01:33.468
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:33.551 --> 01:35.678
- WELL, THIS IS THE WEIRDEST
LITTLE STORY.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.972
UH, BUT TEN YEARS AGO,

01:38.056 --> 01:39.849
I WAS HAVING
A PARTICULARLY BAD DAY.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.559
YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF DAY
THAT CAN ONLY BE CURED

01:41.643 --> 01:44.521
WITH DRINKING AND FAN MAIL.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.524
AND I HAPPENED UPON
THIS ELOQUENTLY-WRITTEN LETTER

01:47.607 --> 01:49.567
FROM A GENTLEMAN
IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.069
WELL, HE WAS SUCH
AN EARNEST FAN,

01:51.152 --> 01:52.529
I HAD TO WRITE HIM BACK.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.739
- YOU WROTE TO A PRISONER?

01:54.823 --> 01:58.326
- WELL, GARY PREFERS THE TERM
"INCARCERATED AMERICAN."

02:00.453 --> 02:02.539
BUT OF COURSE,
I WASN'T RECKLESS ENOUGH

02:02.622 --> 02:03.832
TO USE MY OWN NAME.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.583
- WHAT NAME DID YOU USE?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.377
- WELL, THIS IS THE SECOND
LITTLE WRINKLE IN THE STORY

02:07.460 --> 02:08.711
WHICH, JOY, I THINK YOU
ARE GONNA FIND

02:08.794 --> 02:10.380
PARTICULARLY FUNNY.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.257
- YOU USED MY NAME?

02:12.340 --> 02:14.050
- I PRETENDED
YOU WERE MY ASSISTANT.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.219
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

02:16.302 --> 02:19.681
JOY WOULD MAKE
A TERRIBLE ASSISTANT.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.391
- WELL, I FIGURED
IT WAS SAFE.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.892
- I MEAN,
THERE WASN'T A CHANCE

02:22.976 --> 02:24.060
THEY WERE GONNA
PAROLE THIS GUY

02:24.143 --> 02:26.938
ON ACCOUNT OF HIS...
VIOLENT HISTORY.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.732
- VIOLENT--
WHAT VIOLENT HISTORY?

02:29.816 --> 02:33.236
- OH, SOMETHING ABOUT
BODY PARTS AND...CHOPPING.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.239
UM, I KIND OF SKIMMED
OVER THE SEGMENTS

02:36.322 --> 02:38.449
THAT WEREN'T ABOUT ME,
YOU KNOW.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.285
- SO THIS VIOLENT CRIMINAL

02:40.368 --> 02:41.578
THINKS I'M HIS PEN PAL?

02:41.661 --> 02:42.579
- NO, NO, NO.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.331
HIS PEN LOVER.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.543
BUT YOU BROKE IT OFF
AFTER HE PROPOSED.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.587
AND THEN HE GOT VERY ANGRY
AND, YOU KNOW,

02:50.670 --> 02:51.337
STARTED SAYING,
"OH, IF I EVER GET OUT OF HERE,

02:51.421 --> 02:54.591
I'M GONNA
COME GET YOU, AND... "

02:54.674 --> 02:56.509
- SO WHY ARE WE
HEARING THIS STORY NOW,

02:56.593 --> 02:58.761
INSTEAD OF NEVER--
OH, MY GOD!

02:58.845 --> 02:59.804
HE ESCAPED, DIDN'T HE?

02:59.888 --> 03:02.557
- NO, NO,
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.393
HE WAS JUST PAROLED
YESTERDAY.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.604
LOOK, I NEVER, EVER THOUGHT

03:07.687 --> 03:08.813
THAT ANYTHING
LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.733
JOY, I AM
SO, SO, SO SORRY.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.610
- WE'LL DEAL WITH US LATER.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.819
RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DO TO

03:14.903 --> 03:17.155
ABOUT AN EX-CON
WHO CHOPS UP BODIES

03:17.238 --> 03:18.239
AND IS COMING HERE
TO GET ME.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.450
- HOW ARE WE GONNA
RECOGNIZE HIM?

03:20.533 --> 03:21.492
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE?

03:21.576 --> 03:23.119
- WELL, I NEVER ASKED
FOR A PHOTO.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.371
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO THINK
THAT JOY WAS SHALLOW.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.959
- DOES HE KNOW
WHAT I LOOK LIKE?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.127
- WELL, I MIGHT HAVE SENT HIM
THAT PICTURE OF YOU

03:31.210 --> 03:32.629
FROM OUR TRIP
TO GRAND CAYMAN.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.464
- YOU MEAN THE ONE
IN THE WHITE BIKINI

03:34.547 --> 03:36.841
THAT SHOWED EVERYTHING
WHEN IT GOT WET?

03:36.925 --> 03:38.343
- YOU SHOULD BE FLATTERED.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.470
IT WAS A BIG HIT
WITH THE WHOLE CELL BLOCK.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.976
GARY WAS HAVING
A VERY TOUGH WEEK.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.895
- YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
MY SON STOLE THAT PICTURE,

03:48.978 --> 03:50.438
SO THIS, ACTUALLY,
IT'S QUITE A RELIEF.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.899
NOT--NOT A RELIEF
RIGHT NOW,

03:52.982 --> 03:54.442
BUT--BUT FOR ANOTHER TIME.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.987
[phone rings]

03:58.071 --> 04:00.365
- HELLO?

04:00.448 --> 04:01.950
YES, JOY'S HERE.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.159
WHO'S CALLING?

04:06.120 --> 04:08.790
HE HUNG UP.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.167
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S HIM!

04:11.250 --> 04:13.002
- EVEN MORE THAN USUAL,

04:13.086 --> 04:15.046
I'M GLAD
I'M NOT JOY RIGHT NOW.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.522
{\an8}[both shout]

04:32.605 --> 04:35.233
{\an8}- VICTORIA!
I THOUGHT I HEARD A NOISE.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.110
{\an8}I ALMOST MACED YOU.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.196
{\an8}- THAT'S SUNSCREEN.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.031
{\an8}- OH, WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WAS MY PEPPER SPRAY.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.366
{\an8}WHAT DID YOU THINK
THAT WAS?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.284
{\an8}- I KNEW IT WAS
A MAGNIFYING MIRROR.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.078
{\an8}DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING SCARIER?

04:47.161 --> 04:48.538
{\an8}- WAIT, DON'T POINT
THAT THING AT ME.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.707
{\an8}- HEY.
[all scream]

04:50.790 --> 04:52.125
{\an8}- WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:52.208 --> 04:53.543
{\an8}IS EVERYBODY ALL RIGHT?

04:56.295 --> 04:58.840
{\an8}- ARE YOU HUNTING WABBITS?

04:58.923 --> 05:01.426
{\an8}- IT'S A POLISH PELLET GUN.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.885
{\an8}- WHAT, DOES IT
SHOOT BACKWARDS?

05:02.969 --> 05:05.722
{\an8}[laughter]

05:05.805 --> 05:08.516
{\an8}- ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA MAKE POLISH JOKES

05:08.599 --> 05:10.852
{\an8}WHEN I'M HOLDING A GUN?

05:10.935 --> 05:13.229
{\an8}- LOOK, I HAVE
AN ALARM GUY

05:13.312 --> 05:14.897
{\an8}COMING IN THE MORNING.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.566
{\an8}WE DO NOT NEED ANY GUNS.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.067
{\an8}[gunshot]

05:18.151 --> 05:19.777
{\an8}- AAH!
[man groans]

05:19.861 --> 05:21.863
{\an8}- OH, MY...

05:23.781 --> 05:25.658
{\an8}OH! MY--MY NAME IS OWEN.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.285
{\an8}I'M LOOKING
FOR MY BIRTH MOTHER.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.953
{\an8}WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS JOY SCROGGS?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.457
{\an8}- HER.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.591
- ELKA'S CALLING 911,
AND I BROUGHT SOME ALCOHOL.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.301
- OH, RIGHT, TO STERILIZE
HIS WOUNDS?

05:43.384 --> 05:46.387
- YEAH.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.601
- THANK GOD IT'S JUST
BUCKSHOT IN THE LEG.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.977
HE DOESN'T SEEM
THAT BADLY HURT.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.103
- THEN WHY DID HE FAINT?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.606
- ALL THE SCROGGS MEN FAINT
AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.150
ONE RARE STEAK
CAN RUIN A DINNER PARTY.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.735
HE REALLY IS MINE.

06:00.818 --> 06:01.778
- YEAH, BUT WHEN
HE WAKES UP,

06:01.861 --> 06:02.820
HE'S GONNA THINK
HE'S MINE.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.280
WHY DID YOU SAY I WAS YOU?

06:04.363 --> 06:06.324
- OBVIOUSLY, JOY'S IN SHOCK,

06:06.407 --> 06:07.450
OR SHE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
THE SUPERIOR ACTRESS

06:07.533 --> 06:10.495
FOR THE ROLE.

06:10.578 --> 06:11.621
- I PANICKED.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.331
SINCE I GAVE HIM UP
FOR ADOPTION,

06:13.414 --> 06:15.249
I'VE DREAMED OF WHAT
OUR REUNION WOULD BE LIKE

06:15.333 --> 06:16.626
A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS,

06:16.709 --> 06:17.752
NONE OF WHICH INVOLVED ME
SHOOTING HIM.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.923
PLEASE JUST SAY
YOU'RE ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE

06:22.006 --> 06:23.925
UNTIL I CAN FIGURE OUT
HOW TO EXPLAIN ALL THIS.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.551
- THE AMBULANCE
IS ON THE WAY.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.137
HOW'S HE DOING?
- HE'S WAKING UP.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.806
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DO A BRITISH ACCENT.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.973
- JUST TALK LIKE I DO.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.352
- OH, THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.606
- [cockney accent] 'ELLO.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.781
'OW'S ME OL' SON?

06:46.864 --> 06:49.450
- CALLED IT.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.827
- JOY?

06:50.910 --> 06:53.329
- BLIMEY!

06:53.412 --> 06:55.832
I WISH I'D-A
KNOWN YOU WERE COMIN'.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.583
I'D-A PUT ON A SPOT O' TEA.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.588
I CALL ELEVATORS "LIFTS."

07:05.800 --> 07:09.971
- [deep American accent]
WHAT YOUR MOM IS TRYING TO SAY

07:10.054 --> 07:11.639
IN HER RESERVED
ENGLISH WAY IS,

07:11.722 --> 07:15.393
"GOSH DARN IT,
WE'RE HAPPY YOU'RE HERE."

07:15.476 --> 07:17.478
- THEN WHY DID YOU SHOOT ME?

07:17.562 --> 07:18.729
- [clipped British accent]
PERHAPS I CAN BE

07:18.813 --> 07:21.315
OF SOME ASSISTANCE.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.530
WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT YOU WERE AN EX-CONVICT.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.031
TERRIBLY SORRY.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.324
- WHO ARE YOU?

07:30.408 --> 07:35.037
- I'M LADY WINCHESTER.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.789
- SHE'S ME MUM.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.877
SO YOU'RE MY GRANDMOTHER?

07:40.960 --> 07:44.338
NO, NO, NO.
NO, I AM YOUR STEP-GRANDMOTHER.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.382
I AM YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
SECOND WIFE.

07:46.465 --> 07:48.259
ACTUALLY YOUNGER THAN JOY.

07:48.342 --> 07:51.721
WHICH IS QUITE A SCANDAL,
REALLY.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.765
- YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE
CALLED YOUR MOTHER.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.393
SO SHE COULD HAVE
PREPARED FOR YOUR ARRIVAL.

07:57.476 --> 08:00.229
- I DID CALL; I JUST
GOT NERVOUS AND I HUNG UP.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.064
- OH!
- OH!

08:02.148 --> 08:04.358
- [deep voice] OH.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.778
- WELL, NO WORRIES.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.156
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

08:10.239 --> 08:13.451
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER YOURSELF
AT 'OME.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.539
- DON'T DROP
YOUR Hs, DARLING.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.042
OH, WHY CAN'T THE ENGLISH
LEARN TO SPEAK.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.668
- YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO SAY.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.754
YOU'RE NOT ME REAL MUM.
- DON'T YOU BE IMPERTINENT.

08:24.837 --> 08:28.257
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
BOTH OF YOU STOP IT.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.218
I'M JOY.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.761
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.640
- WHAT?
WAIT, YOU'RE MY MOTHER?

08:35.722 --> 08:37.475
WHY DID YOU PRETEND
THAT YOU WEREN'T?

08:37.558 --> 08:39.727
- I PANICKED.

08:39.809 --> 08:41.645
- AND WHO SHOT ME?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.481
- THAT WAS ME TOO.

08:43.563 --> 08:44.941
BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

08:45.024 --> 08:45.733
- SHE'S RIGHT.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.443
TECHNICALLY,
THE COUCH SHOT YOU.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.612
- YEAH, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
START AT THE BEGINNING.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.404
YOU SEE, I WAS WRITING
LOVE NOTES

08:50.488 --> 08:51.948
TO A PRISONER,
AS YOUR MOTHER.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.283
- ARE YOU ALL INSANE?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.327
- OH, GOOD!
THE PARAMEDICS ARE HERE.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.120
- I'LL FOLLOW YOU
IN MY CAR.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.249
AND TRUST ME, THINGS HERE
AREN'T AS CRAZY AS THEY SEEM.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.459
- [Irish accent] I BROUGHT
A WEE BAG OF ICE

09:03.543 --> 09:05.795
FOR THE WEE 'UN'S LEG.

09:07.588 --> 09:11.384
WHAT? THEY'RE NOT
DOING THAT ANYMORE?

09:14.762 --> 09:16.764
- I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH JOY.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.140
SHE'S STILL WAITING
TO SEE OWEN,

09:18.224 --> 09:20.142
BUT THE DOCTOR SAYS
HE'S RESTING COMFORTABLY.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.687
- THAT'S GOOD.
I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TOO.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.355
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
FOR PAROLEES

09:24.438 --> 09:26.357
TO LEAVE THE STATE
THEY WERE INCARCERATED IN.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.483
SO GARY CAN'T LEAVE
PENNSYLVANIA.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.861
- SO HE'S FAR?
NEAR?

09:33.739 --> 09:34.949
- IT'S THE STATE
TO OUR RIGHT.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.284
- STAGE RIGHT?

09:36.367 --> 09:37.952
[doorbell rings]

09:38.035 --> 09:39.704
- OH, I BET THAT'S
THE ALARM GUY.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.330
JOY SAID HE'D BE BY
AROUND 11:00.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.501
- HI.
HERE TO SEE JOY SCROGGS.

09:45.584 --> 09:48.504
- OH, YOU MUST BE
FROM THE ALARM COMPANY.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.131
- YES.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.966
MAY I COME IN?

09:52.049 --> 09:54.135
- WELL, JOY'S NOT HERE,
BUT WE LIVE HERE TOO.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.304
AND I GUESS WE SHOULD STILL
GET THAT ALARM SYSTEM, RIGHT?

09:56.387 --> 09:57.305
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.306
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
TO DRINK

09:58.389 --> 09:59.307
WHILE YOU CHECK
OUT THE HOUSE?

09:59.390 --> 10:02.518
- GREAT, THANKS.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.020
- WELL, I SEE YOU STARING,

10:04.103 --> 10:06.272
AND, YES, I AM TELEVISION'S
VICTORIA CHASE.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.858
- HEY, DON'T SELL
YOUR FILM WORK SHORT.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.735
YOU WERE GREAT AS THE OUTRAGED
WHITE CONGRESSWOMAN

10:10.818 --> 10:12.069
IN <i> MADEA GOES TO WASHINGTON.</i>

10:12.153 --> 10:14.613
- OH.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.032
"TURN THAT MUSIC DOWN!

10:16.115 --> 10:17.616
WE'RE TRYING TO FILIBUSTER!"

10:24.081 --> 10:26.042
- [on voicemail] "HEY, THIS IS
REGGIE WITH THE ALARM COMPANY.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.209
"I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT TODAY,

10:27.293 --> 10:28.544
"SO PLEASE CALL
TO RESCHEDULE.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.755
THANKS."

10:30.838 --> 10:31.881
- OH--OH, MY GOD.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.841
- AND THEN I WOULD HAVE SAID,

10:33.924 --> 10:35.551
"OH, IT'S JUST AN HONOR
BEING NOMINATED

10:35.634 --> 10:37.928
WITH ALL THESE
TALENTED WOMEN.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.513
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MAD I AM

10:39.597 --> 10:41.766
THAT YOU NEVER GOT
TO MAKE YOUR SPEECH.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.726
IF I COULD KIDNAP EVERYONE WHO
WAS IN THE AUDIENCE THAT NIGHT

10:43.809 --> 10:47.229
AND MAKE THEM LISTEN TO IT,
I WOULD.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.024
- THAT IS SO SWEET.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.525
- VICTORIA.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.693
CAN I SEE YOU
IN THE KITCHEN, PLEASE?

10:52.777 --> 10:54.195
I NEED SOME HELP
WITH THE LEMONADE.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.614
- WELL, WE'RE KIND OF IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING HERE.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.366
HOW HARD IS IT
TO MAKE LEMONADE?

10:58.449 --> 10:59.617
NO, I MEAN, REALLY--
HOW HARD IS IT?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.744
I SERIOUSLY HAVE NO IDEA.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.371
- PSST.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.918
- IF I AM ANY JUDGE
OF CHARACTER,

11:09.001 --> 11:11.462
THAT GUY IS A WINNER.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.047
- THAT'S NOT THE ALARM GUY.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.549
I THINK THAT'S GARY--
CRAZED EX-CON GARY.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.801
- NO, IT CAN'T BE.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.929
NO, HE'S NOT ALLOWED
TO LEAVE PORTLAND.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.390
- PENNSYLVANIA.

11:22.473 --> 11:26.644
- HEY, WHOSE CREEPY VAN
IS PARKED OUT FRONT?

11:26.727 --> 11:28.270
- THAT'S THE CONVICT'S.
WE GOTTA RUN.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.731
- NOT A GOOD IDEA.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.454
- [gasps]

11:45.538 --> 11:47.957
- I'M SORRY.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.000
- HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
STARING AT ME ALL NIGHT?

11:50.084 --> 11:51.961
- NOT ALL NIGHT.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.129
I WENT DOWN
TO THE MATERNITY WARD

11:53.212 --> 11:57.466
AND STARED AT THE BABIES UNTIL
SECURITY ASKED ME TO LEAVE.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.635
ANYWAY, GREAT NEWS.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.095
YOU'RE BUCKSHOT FREE.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.930
- SO I HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT
OF BUCKSHOT

12:03.013 --> 12:04.974
AS I HAD BEFORE I MET YOU.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.309
- YOU'LL PROBABLY LAUGH
ABOUT THAT SOMEDAY.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.811
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.813
IF THINGS WORK OUT.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.648
WE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT
NOW, IF YOU WISH,

12:12.731 --> 12:14.650
OR WE COULD JUST TALK--
I'VE GOT ALL DAY.

12:14.733 --> 12:18.028
- ABOUT THAT, UM...

12:18.112 --> 12:20.823
YOU KNOW THAT I HAD COLD FEET
ABOUT COMING TO SEE YOU.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.784
AND THEN I STARTED PICTURING
WHAT THIS WOMAN MIGHT BE LIKE.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.161
AND WHAT YOU MIGHT
BE LIKE, AND...

12:25.244 --> 12:27.496
AND HOW WE MIGHT HAVE
THIS LIFE-CHANGING,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.039
COSMIC CONNECTION.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.833
SO A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
I TOLD MYSELF,

12:30.916 --> 12:32.460
JUST GET ON A PLANE
AND DO IT.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.503
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.505
[forced laugh]

12:36.589 --> 12:39.216
- THIS WASN'T HOW I PICTURED
OUR FIRST MEETING EITHER.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.386
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE CLOSEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD TO ME,

12:42.470 --> 12:43.846
BIOLOGICALLY.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.015
BUT WE'RE COMPLETE STRANGERS.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.392
IT'S JUST ALL
SO OVERWHELMING.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.145
- MAYBE THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.522
I MEAN, YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE,
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.232
- BUT THAT'S THE EXACT,
SAME RELATIONSHIP

12:55.316 --> 12:56.984
I HAVE WITH MY MOTHER!

12:57.067 --> 12:59.028
WE CAN BUILD ON THIS.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.655
- LOOK, YOU SEEM LIKE
A REALLY NICE WOMAN.

13:01.739 --> 13:05.451
BUT I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD SAY WE MET,

13:05.534 --> 13:07.161
MYSTERY SOLVED,

13:07.244 --> 13:09.538
AND GET BACK
TO OUR REGULAR LIVES.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.208
OR...MY REGULAR LIFE

13:12.291 --> 13:15.711
AND WHATEVER THAT WAS GOING ON
OVER AT YOUR HOUSE.

13:15.794 --> 13:19.340
- SO...THIS IS GOOD-BYE.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.634
- I THINK IT'S FOR THE BEST.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.722
- SO WHERE'S JOY?

13:26.805 --> 13:28.891
- I DON'T KNOW.
PLEASE DON'T KILL US.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.476
- I'M NOT GONNA KILL ANYBODY.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.685
WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

13:31.769 --> 13:33.521
- WELL, THE REASON
YOU WENT TO PRISON.

13:33.604 --> 13:36.023
BODY PARTS.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.567
- AUTO BODY PARTS.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.527
I RAN A RING OF CHOP CHOPS.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.237
I WROTE THAT IN MY FIRST
FAN LETTER TO YOU.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.405
- VICTORIA DOESN'T READ ANYTHING
THAT'S NOT ABOUT HER.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.533
- I REALLY DON'T.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.370
- LOOK, I'VE DONE
A LITTLE TIME MYSELF.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.372
SO ONE CON TO ANOTHER,

13:51.455 --> 13:52.957
FORGET JOY.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.750
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO TO A STRIP CLUB,

13:54.833 --> 13:58.420
LIKE A REAL PAROLEE?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.589
THAT'S AN AWESOME IDEA.
I'LL GIVE YOU ALL MY SINGLES.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.468
YOU CAN MAKE IT RAIN.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.096
- I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT
FOR TOO LONG.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.764
I'M GONNA MAKE HER SORRY
SHE RUINED MY LIFE.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.100
- SHE DIDN'T RUIN YOUR LIFE.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.768
I DID.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.937
I'M THE ONE WHO
WROTE ALL THOSE LETTERS.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.897
I JUST USED
HER NAME AND PICTURE,

14:16.981 --> 14:18.399
BECAUSE I'M A CELEBRITY,

14:18.482 --> 14:21.110
AND CELEBRITIES...CAN'T BE
ASSOCIATED WITH PRISONERS,

14:21.193 --> 14:22.444
UNLESS THEY'RE
RESEARCHING A ROLE.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.947
AND I NEVER GET THOSE PARTS.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.950
TOO GLAMOROUS.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.286
- YOU WROTE ALL THE LETTERS?

14:30.369 --> 14:32.663
- YES, YOU SEE, I'M THE ONE
YOU'RE MADLY IN LOVE WITH.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.290
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.958
I FELL IN LOVE WITH JOY,
THE GIRL FROM THE PICTURE.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.084
YOU'RE NOT EVEN MY TYPE.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.168
- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE!

14:38.252 --> 14:39.461
WE'RE THE SAME TYPE--

14:39.545 --> 14:41.422
GORGEOUS, WILLOWY BRUNETTES.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.465
AND I WROTE
ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LETTERS.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.801
- UH, YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO WIN HIM OVER.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.469
- OH, YEAH.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.809
- OH, IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

14:53.892 --> 14:55.311
- YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE NEW.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.063
- THE STRIP CLUB
IS OPEN TILL 4:00.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.441
[door closes]

15:00.524 --> 15:01.817
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

15:01.900 --> 15:04.194
- OH, JOY, THIS IS GARY.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.613
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S YOU!

15:05.696 --> 15:07.448
BUT IT'S NOT YOU.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.199
- THIS IS THE GARY

15:09.283 --> 15:11.619
THAT WE WERE AFRAID
WAS GONNA KILL ME?

15:11.702 --> 15:12.620
IS HE CRYING?

15:12.703 --> 15:14.330
- LIKE BRETT FAVRE

15:14.413 --> 15:17.374
RETIRING
FOR THE TENTH TIME.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.212
- ALL THESE YEARS,
I'VE BEEN IMAGINING

15:22.296 --> 15:24.340
HOW I WAS FINALLY GONNA
MEET YOU AND WIN YOU BACK.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.843
OR, YOU KNOW, MAKE YOU PAY.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.720
THIS IS NOT HOW
I PICTURED IT AT ALL.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.847
- WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE THE WAY

15:31.930 --> 15:33.182
PEOPLE BLOODY PICTURE IT?

15:33.265 --> 15:35.142
LIFE DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY!

15:35.225 --> 15:37.686
- BOY, YOU GOT
A TEMPER ON YOU.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.813
- YOU DODGED A BULLET.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.234
- I'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.656
- GARY, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO TOO.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.367
YOUR PAROLE OFFICER'S
PROBABLY WORRIED SICK.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.743
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
NO REASON TO STAY HERE.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.870
- WAIT, GARY...

15:54.953 --> 15:58.123
UH...I CAN'T HELP
BUT FEEL RESPONSIBLE

15:58.207 --> 16:00.084
FOR WHAT'S
HAPPENED HERE TODAY.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.377
SO ANY TIME YOU'RE
FEELING LONELY,

16:01.460 --> 16:04.546
PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO CALL THIS NUMBER.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.631
- SUSAN LUCCI?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.389
- TELL HER I SAID HI.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.895
- SO MAYBE THIS WASN'T WHAT
EITHER ONE OF US EXPECTED.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.230
HOW COULD IT BE?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.732
THIS AWKWARD AND PAINFUL
AND MESSY,

16:23.816 --> 16:25.943
AND NO ONE PICTURES MESSY.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.237
BUT SOMETIMES, IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO WORK THROUGH THE MESSY,

16:28.320 --> 16:30.322
YOU END UP GETTING
TO SOMETHING GOOD.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.910
THAT WAS IT.
THE WHOLE SPEECH.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.537
MAYBE I SAID IT TOO FAST.

16:36.620 --> 16:40.582
THE, "HI, OWEN,
WE HAVE TO TALK" WAS IMPLIED.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.418
- OKAY.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.963
- OKAY IS PROMISING.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.090
- ALL RIGHT.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.258
LET'S GET MESSY.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.307
UM...WHO'S MY DAD?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.438
- A CHARMING, LYING,
HANDSOME RAT

17:02.521 --> 17:05.773
WHO NO GIRL COULD RESIST.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.276
MY TURN.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.652
ARE YOU MARRIED?

17:08.736 --> 17:10.112
- DIVORCED.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.489
- ALREADY?
-<i> BIG</i> MESS.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.615
- SORRY.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.657
KIDS?

17:14.742 --> 17:15.784
- YOU'RE NOT A GRANDMOTHER.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.162
- OH, THANK GOD.

17:18.244 --> 17:19.829
OH, I MEAN, SOMEDAY
WHEN I'M READY.

17:19.913 --> 17:23.416
I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE READY.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.627
- IS THERE ANY BALDNESS
IN THE FAMILY?

17:25.711 --> 17:29.006
- NO. NOT AMONG THE MEN.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.675
SO GOOD FOR YOU,
BAD FOR ME.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.636
- WHAT DO YOU DO?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.097
- I TEACH GUN SAFETY.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.976
I'M--I'M--I'M KIDDING.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.478
I'M AN ACTUARY.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.481
- OH, WOW, AN ACTUARY.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.983
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT IS.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.777
- IT'S AN INSURANCE THING.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.819
UH, HOW 'BOUT YOU?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.613
- OH, I CONVINCE CELEBRITIES

17:52.696 --> 17:54.656
THAT THEY'RE PLUCKING
THEIR EYEBROWS ALL WRONG,

17:54.740 --> 17:56.492
AND THEY PAY ME A FORTUNE
TO DO IT RIGHT.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.994
- WELL, HOW ARE MY BROWS?
- OH, THEY'RE FINE.

17:59.077 --> 18:00.120
YOU'RE GROOMING THEM
ALL WRONG.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.456
- REALLY?
- NO. SEE HOW EASY IT IS?

18:02.539 --> 18:05.751
[both laugh]

18:05.834 --> 18:08.504
OKAY. HERE COMES THE--
THE BIG ONE.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.007
UM...

18:12.090 --> 18:14.259
WHY DID YOU GIVE ME UP?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.680
- WELL...

18:18.764 --> 18:21.391
FOR THIS MOMENT...

18:21.475 --> 18:25.020
THAT SOMEDAY, I WOULD
MEET YOU AGAIN.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.815
AND YOU WOULD BE
WELL-RAISED AND HEALTHY

18:27.898 --> 18:30.192
AND HAPPY.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.402
AND YOU MIGHT BE MY FRIEND.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.865
- I'D LIKE THAT.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.462
- ALSO, THAT YOU MIGHT
TAKE CARE OF ME IN MY OLD AGE.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.299
- WE'LL SEE.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.099
- WELL, I, FOR ONE,
TRULY ENJOYED

19:02.182 --> 19:03.517
<i>BIBLE STORIES</i>
<i>TOLD THROUGH PETS.</i>

19:03.600 --> 19:05.853
ALTHOUGH I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED
ABOUT NOAH'S ARK.

19:05.936 --> 19:09.022
I MEAN, NOAH WAS A DOG,
BUT HE HAD DOGS.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.149
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.027
MICKEY MOUSE
HAD PLUTO AS A PET,

19:14.111 --> 19:15.070
BUT GOOFY AS A FRIEND.

19:15.153 --> 19:15.904
SO, YEAH, MAKES SENSE.

19:17.781 --> 19:18.949
- WHY DID EVERY BIRD
IN THAT BLOODY SHOW

19:19.032 --> 19:21.285
PICK ME TO CRAP ON?

19:21.368 --> 19:22.619
- I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD QUESTION

19:22.703 --> 19:26.415
THE WISDOM OF THE ANIMALS.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.834
- WELL, I AM JUST SO PROUD
OF CHANCE, OUR LITTLE STAR.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.378
- OH, STOP TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.338
- OH, COME ON.
HE STOLE THE SHOW.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.300
- HE STOLE THE BABY JESUS.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.557
- COME ON, LET'S GO INSIDE
AND TURN SOME WATER INTO WINE.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.225
- HEY, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'RE COMING HOME

19:45.309 --> 19:46.768
TO OUR NEW ALARM SYSTEM.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.104
- [electronic voice]
FRONT DOOR OPEN.

19:49.187 --> 19:50.564
- HURRY, YOU HAVE 20 SECONDS
TO PUT IN THE CODE.

19:50.647 --> 19:51.732
- I FORGOT WHAT WE AGREED ON.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.609
WAS IT ONE OF
MY KIDS' BIRTHDAYS?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.444
- UH, NO, I THINK IT WAS
THE YEAR I WAS BORN.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.280
- CAN'T BE--THE CODE
HAS TO BE FOUR NUMBERS.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.949
- [electronic voice]
TEN SECONDS TO ALARM.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.784
- OH, OH, MAYBE
IT'S MY GOAL WEIGHT!

20:02.868 --> 20:05.287
BUT IS IT MY DREAM GOAL WEIGHT
OR MY REALISTIC GOAL WEIGHT?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.915
- YOUR GOAL WEIGHT
HAS FOUR NUMBERS IN IT?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.416
- THERE'S A DECIMAL POINT
INVOLVED.

20:09.499 --> 20:13.295
I REMEMBER!
IT WAS THE YEAR I WAS BORN.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.172
- [electronic voice]
CODE DECLINED.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.257
- YOU LIED ABOUT YOUR AGE
TO THE ALARM?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.635
- WELL, I FELT
IT WAS JUDGING ME.

20:19.718 --> 20:20.802
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE 10 YEARS OFF.

20:20.886 --> 20:21.970
NO, 12.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.349
I WAS FEELING
VERY VULNERABLE THAT DAY.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.934
- [electronic voice]
THANK YOU, MISS CHASE.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.520
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.022
IT COSTS A LITTLE EXTRA,

20:32.105 --> 20:34.232
BUT IT MAKES ME
FEEL MORE SECURE.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.777
