( theme music playing )

00:33.389 --> 00:35.264
Woman's voice:
Listen, Daniel,

00:35.264 --> 00:38.888
I'm gonna ask you to please
stop texting and calling me.

00:38.888 --> 00:41.680
I want you to understand
I'm not angry anymore.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.555
I'm not trying to punish you
for what you did.

00:44.555 --> 00:46.389
I understand
you're having a hard time,

00:46.389 --> 00:48.596
and I'm sorry
for what happened to you,

00:48.596 --> 00:51.805
but it's been 20 years.

00:51.805 --> 00:53.013
I'll always love you.

00:53.013 --> 00:55.846
I just--
you're a child

00:55.846 --> 00:57.930
and you're
a broken person,

00:57.930 --> 01:00.930
and I just don't think
that I can be married
to you anymore.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.596
( TV playing )

01:12.097 --> 01:14.222
( audience laughing on TV )

01:51.555 --> 01:54.013
- ( door opens )
- Man: What's up?

01:54.013 --> 01:55.430
( door closes )

02:00.138 --> 02:01.514
Patrick?

02:04.264 --> 02:05.514
Daniel.

02:09.055 --> 02:11.347
What are you
doing here?

02:12.888 --> 02:15.430
- Dude, I fucking live here.
- ( grunts )

02:18.846 --> 02:21.138
Oh, dude,
are you gonna eat that?
They didn't have any food.

02:22.846 --> 02:25.138
That thing?
Yeah.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.347
Shit.

02:32.347 --> 02:33.514
Dude...

02:39.055 --> 02:40.472
( chuckles )

02:40.472 --> 02:43.930
My God, what the fuck--
what the fuck is wrong with you?

02:43.930 --> 02:45.514
Oh, nothing.

02:45.514 --> 02:47.097
- Nothing.
- You're acting weird.

02:47.097 --> 02:49.055
- You're acting weird.
- Are you trippin'?

02:49.055 --> 02:50.805
- No.
- Are you?

02:50.805 --> 02:52.888
- Where were you?
- Dude, where do you
think I was?

02:52.888 --> 02:55.596
( chuckles )

02:55.596 --> 02:57.222
- Dude.
- What?

02:57.222 --> 03:01.013
I got 'em.
Happy birthday,
best friend-o!

03:01.013 --> 03:02.555
Come on, man.
Get 'em.

03:02.555 --> 03:03.888
Fucking get 'em.

03:05.555 --> 03:07.055
( grunts )

03:12.264 --> 03:14.555
Dude, it's fucking
Sound Garden, Melvins,

03:14.555 --> 03:16.888
- Screaming Trees, fucking
Rage Against the Machine!
- No way!

03:16.888 --> 03:19.430
- Dude!
- ( laughing )

03:19.430 --> 03:21.222
Three!

03:21.222 --> 03:23.638
I know it's a lot,
but I really think
it's gonna be worth it

03:23.638 --> 03:24.888
'cause it's
a fucking experience.

03:24.888 --> 03:27.888
Let's just do it.
Let's just go.

03:27.888 --> 03:29.846
These are fucking
crazy cheap.

03:29.846 --> 03:31.930
But I think
it's gonna be worth it.

03:31.930 --> 03:35.596
No, but how are
these so cheap?

03:35.596 --> 03:37.472
Dude, they're 20 bucks,
like, apiece.

03:37.472 --> 03:40.264
No, I know, exactly.
I'm-- I'm just saying...

03:41.846 --> 03:44.389
- Ah, shit.
- What?

03:44.389 --> 03:46.180
This concert.

03:46.180 --> 03:48.097
It's gonna be
sweet as fuck.

03:48.097 --> 03:51.138
No, we-- we are--
( sighs )

03:51.138 --> 03:52.763
we already went
to this concert.

03:54.222 --> 03:55.472
What do you mean?

03:59.138 --> 04:00.763
What's going on?

04:00.763 --> 04:02.055
What?

04:02.055 --> 04:04.972
What's going on
with your fucking face?

04:04.972 --> 04:06.763
What are you
talking about?

04:10.555 --> 04:11.555
Don't do that.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.180
Don't do that!

04:14.180 --> 04:16.430
( panting )

04:16.430 --> 04:18.805
( TV playing )

04:23.264 --> 04:28.389
Man on TV:
...the horrific,
the terrifying cat.

04:28.389 --> 04:30.264
( audience laughing )

04:30.264 --> 04:32.805
Could we have picked
a more friendly guardian?

04:32.805 --> 04:34.930
( audience laughing )

04:43.264 --> 04:45.180
( urinating )

04:45.180 --> 04:49.013
( chuckles )
Fucking Rage Against
the Machine.

04:54.514 --> 04:56.138
( keyboard clicks )

04:59.472 --> 05:02.638
( music playing )

05:02.638 --> 05:04.638
( keyboard clicks )

05:10.013 --> 05:11.389
( exhales )

05:17.680 --> 05:19.555
Can you hear me?

05:23.805 --> 05:26.555
Do you wanna
hang out tonight?

05:29.138 --> 05:31.472
And maybe give me
some advice?

05:34.514 --> 05:37.472
I'm just having
a really hard time...

05:38.846 --> 05:41.180
and I kind of need you
right now.

06:16.389 --> 06:19.055
( toilet flushes )

06:19.055 --> 06:20.930
( faucet running )

06:29.264 --> 06:31.264
( water sloshes )

06:37.180 --> 06:39.055
( both laughing )

06:39.055 --> 06:42.472
Are you trying
to sneak a peek right now,
you fucking pervert?

06:42.472 --> 06:44.888
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

06:44.888 --> 06:46.930
All right, here.

06:46.930 --> 06:50.430
Don't go anywhere.
Just get dressed, okay?

06:50.430 --> 06:52.930
I need to talk to you
about some stuff,
so hurry up.

06:55.638 --> 06:57.097
( chuckles )

07:27.264 --> 07:28.514
Patrick?

07:31.430 --> 07:32.805
Patrick?

07:38.389 --> 07:40.347
- Patrick?
- What?

07:40.347 --> 07:42.514
Oh, nothing.
Sorry.

07:42.514 --> 07:45.638
Um, I just thought
maybe you left.

07:45.638 --> 07:48.763
Ugh, dude, it smells
like one of your bland-ass
turkey farts in there still.

07:48.763 --> 07:50.013
Shut up.

07:50.013 --> 07:51.638
- Get over here.
- ( gasps )

07:51.638 --> 07:54.930
- Ta-da!
- Oh, my God!

07:54.930 --> 07:57.347
Trying to sell me
some Amway shit right now?

07:57.347 --> 07:59.013
No, but I need
your advice.

07:59.013 --> 08:00.514
- ( clears throat )
- Wow.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.389
Are you gonna
eat that?

08:02.389 --> 08:04.180
Um, no.

08:04.180 --> 08:05.721
You...

08:05.721 --> 08:07.347
- Yay!
- You sit.

08:07.347 --> 08:09.472
You eat. Oop!

08:09.472 --> 08:11.805
Thank you.

08:11.805 --> 08:14.264
Um...

08:14.264 --> 08:17.389
Diane, she knows
about everything.

08:17.389 --> 08:18.888
Fuck! Everything?

08:18.888 --> 08:20.721
Everything,
and it is fucked up

08:20.721 --> 08:23.680
because I was-- I was ready
to break it off with Brenda.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.472
Like, I was going to,
but Diane--

08:25.472 --> 08:27.596
Dude, I don't know--
I don't know who Brenda is.

08:27.596 --> 08:29.264
Brenda's my boss
from work.

08:29.264 --> 08:31.180
She brought me
into the catalogues
department, right?

08:31.180 --> 08:33.680
You know, she hooked me up,
even though she knew I lied
about college.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.305
- What did you
lie about college?
- I didn't graduate.

08:36.305 --> 08:38.097
You didn't
fucking graduate?!

08:38.097 --> 08:40.055
- I didn't graduate, whatever!
- You fucking dropped out?!

08:40.055 --> 08:41.305
- Yeah.
- You?

08:41.305 --> 08:44.389
Yeah. Things happened
that-- whatever.

08:44.389 --> 08:46.514
I dropped out,
and we're not gonna--

08:49.389 --> 08:51.222
Brenda and I
got close, okay?

08:51.222 --> 08:52.972
- That's what happened,
all right?
- Okay.

08:52.972 --> 08:56.430
It was w-- it was
a natural thing
that happened

08:56.430 --> 08:59.138
and, you know,
we slept together.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.472
And after you have kids,
that shit goes away,

09:01.472 --> 09:03.180
so it was, like,
kind of a big deal.

09:03.180 --> 09:06.596
And honestly,
Diane and I were having
a horrible rough patch.

09:06.596 --> 09:08.805
I mean, we haven't been good
since Patrick was born, so.

09:08.805 --> 09:10.055
Who's Patrick?

09:10.055 --> 09:11.555
My first kid.

09:11.555 --> 09:13.888
You know,
my oldest kid?

09:13.888 --> 09:16.596
You named
your first kid after--

09:16.596 --> 09:18.097
- after me?
- Yeah!

09:18.097 --> 09:20.430
Yeah, man!
I-- you know that.

09:20.430 --> 09:22.180
I know, I just...

09:22.180 --> 09:24.555
Yeah, so anyways, I thought
we'd sleep together
for a little bit

09:24.555 --> 09:27.097
and then Diane and I would
get over our rough patch
or whatever,

09:27.097 --> 09:29.430
but Diane and I
just got worse.

09:29.430 --> 09:31.846
You cannot smoke in here.
It's a hotel room.

09:31.846 --> 09:33.805
- Well, fucking...
- And it's really fucked up

09:33.805 --> 09:35.514
'cause I was gonna
break it off with Brenda.

09:35.514 --> 09:36.972
But Diane found out,

09:36.972 --> 09:39.472
like, literally two weeks
before she even told me.

09:39.472 --> 09:41.430
She saw us
at fucking Baskin-Robbins.

09:41.430 --> 09:43.763
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah, and that's
the whole thing

09:43.763 --> 09:46.721
is, like, I'm ready
to fly straight
and come home,

09:46.721 --> 09:48.097
and now she won't even
fucking talk to me.

09:48.097 --> 09:49.763
She won't even
answer my texts.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.430
So, I'm glad you're here

09:51.430 --> 09:53.430
because I don't know
what to do.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.514
So, you're asking
my advice about this?

09:58.514 --> 10:01.013
Yeah!
( chuckles )

10:01.013 --> 10:02.763
I mean, I need help.

10:02.763 --> 10:05.763
I'm a little bit lost
and I need your help.

10:05.763 --> 10:07.055
( exhales )

10:07.055 --> 10:09.305
I don't know what to say.
( chuckles )

10:14.721 --> 10:16.472
I don't know.

10:16.472 --> 10:18.763
( sighs )

10:18.763 --> 10:20.680
- But you know me.
- What, dude?

10:20.680 --> 10:23.805
- I don't--
- No, you know me
better than anybody.

10:23.805 --> 10:25.805
Dude, I know you.

10:25.805 --> 10:29.013
I've never been married
and I've never had these,
like, affairs.

10:29.013 --> 10:30.721
I'm fucking
21 years old, man.

10:30.721 --> 10:32.430
How the fuck
am I supposed to know
about this shit?

10:32.430 --> 10:33.846
I know,
but didn't you used to

10:33.846 --> 10:35.846
kind of mess around
behind your girlfriends' backs

10:35.846 --> 10:37.264
and always, like,
get back with them?

10:37.264 --> 10:38.930
Sure.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.180
Okay.

10:40.180 --> 10:42.430
And are you not, like,

10:42.430 --> 10:44.514
- in a certain...
- Certain...?

10:44.514 --> 10:47.305
...position right now
to, like, know?

10:48.930 --> 10:50.347
What do you mean?

10:56.430 --> 10:58.305
- Um...
- ( chuckles )

10:58.305 --> 11:00.138
- ...never mind.
- God, dude,

11:00.138 --> 11:02.180
it sounds like
you need to talk to
a therapist or something,

11:02.180 --> 11:04.222
or, like, just go
and fucking, like--

11:04.222 --> 11:05.389
dude,
talk to your dad.

11:05.389 --> 11:07.180
Really,
I'm gonna do that?

11:07.180 --> 11:08.763
I don't know, man.

11:08.763 --> 11:11.180
( sighs )

11:11.180 --> 11:13.763
Dude, I wish I could be
more help, you know?

11:13.763 --> 11:15.180
I just, like...

11:18.680 --> 11:21.097
Just 'cause I'm dead
doesn't mean I'm, like,
this angel

11:21.097 --> 11:23.680
that can just see everything
about your life, you know?

11:25.805 --> 11:27.013
( chuckles )

11:45.264 --> 11:46.721
I'm sorry.

11:50.180 --> 11:51.721
( can pops open )

11:57.930 --> 12:00.514
( sighs )
It's all good, dude.

12:07.596 --> 12:10.596
So, what you
been up to?

12:10.596 --> 12:12.472
What?

12:12.472 --> 12:15.305
Just, like,
what do you do all day?

12:16.514 --> 12:18.638
Like, not much.

12:18.638 --> 12:22.180
- Not much?
- ( chuckles ) Mm-hmm.

12:22.180 --> 12:25.264
No, like,
nothing, really.

12:25.264 --> 12:26.763
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:26.763 --> 12:28.596
No, I, like--
you call me sometimes

12:28.596 --> 12:30.638
and, like,
sometimes I'll come and...

12:32.472 --> 12:35.389
Otherwise, I'm just
kind of, like...
( exhales )

12:40.430 --> 12:42.097
What?

12:42.097 --> 12:44.138
I just feel like
this is something

12:44.138 --> 12:46.347
that you'd, like,
say that you really
want to know,

12:46.347 --> 12:48.138
but I don't think
you actually wanna know.

12:50.514 --> 12:51.930
I wanna know.

12:55.472 --> 12:56.805
I swim.

12:58.888 --> 13:01.472
Swim like my life
is depending on it.

13:07.097 --> 13:09.013
I just wanna know,
like...

13:11.055 --> 13:14.222
do you think
that if you had been
out there with me...

13:14.222 --> 13:17.846
like, past that break,
do you think that you
would be dead, too?

13:20.138 --> 13:23.472
Or you think,
like, maybe...

13:23.472 --> 13:25.472
if you just had, like,
a moment of raw courage

13:25.472 --> 13:28.013
and you crashed
through the break and you
sort of swam towards me,

13:28.013 --> 13:29.846
do you think, like...

13:29.846 --> 13:31.514
( thudding )

13:31.514 --> 13:32.888
( window closes )

13:32.888 --> 13:34.888
Just, do you think
you could've saved me?

13:34.888 --> 13:37.180
Like, do you think
you could've brought me back in?

13:39.888 --> 13:41.680
- You know what I think.
- What?

13:41.680 --> 13:43.680
I said I think you know
what I think.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.638
No, I think,
like, I know, like,
what you're telling everybody

13:46.638 --> 13:48.805
and, like,
what you're sort of saying

13:48.805 --> 13:52.013
so you don't kind of
suffocate under the guilt
of just watching your--

13:52.013 --> 13:54.264
like, your best friend drown
30 yards away from you

13:54.264 --> 13:56.347
while you were
safe and sound on shore.

13:59.763 --> 14:02.097
The current
was not that strong.

14:02.097 --> 14:04.013
You weren't supposed--
I told you, don't go out there.

14:04.013 --> 14:06.222
Dude, you're supposed to be
this great swimmer, right?

14:06.222 --> 14:07.680
Nobody was supposed
to be out there.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.347
Yeah, okay, but, like...
( exhales )

14:12.763 --> 14:14.305
Okay, it's kind of like
at Lollapalooza.

14:14.305 --> 14:17.347
Like, do you remember when you--
like, you were so drunk

14:17.347 --> 14:19.264
and, like, you were trying
to drink and drive,

14:19.264 --> 14:23.097
and I was trying to stop you,
so then I pinned you down

14:23.097 --> 14:25.596
and I, like, took your keys
and I fucking threw them
into the field

14:25.596 --> 14:28.888
and I was just-- I was,
like, making sure, like,
you couldn't drive, you know?

14:28.888 --> 14:31.222
Like, I was, like--

14:31.222 --> 14:33.472
like, I made sure
you were safe, you know,

14:33.472 --> 14:35.721
because that's--
I'm, like--

14:35.721 --> 14:37.555
like, you're
my best friend, you know?

14:37.555 --> 14:39.888
That's just what
best friends do
for each other.

14:39.888 --> 14:42.846
Yeah, I thought
worst case scenario, it was
gonna take you out sideways.

14:42.846 --> 14:45.013
Dude, you know me
and you knew that
I was gonna push it.

14:45.013 --> 14:48.389
I mean, you knew
that I was gonna fight it.
That's fucking what I do.

14:48.389 --> 14:52.472
And it was your job
to fucking just call me out!

14:52.472 --> 14:55.596
I assumed that
if I was being unsafe,
you would've stopped me,

14:55.596 --> 14:57.472
would've made me
get out of the water.

14:57.472 --> 14:59.305
Man, maybe you
wouldn't even let me
go in in the first place.

14:59.305 --> 15:00.596
- That was--
- Don't say that.

15:00.596 --> 15:02.180
No, that was just, like,
our fucking dynamic.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.596
- It's not fair.
- You think it's fair

15:03.596 --> 15:05.888
that I'm the one
who's fucking dead?

15:05.888 --> 15:09.264
Now I just get fucking
dragged around with you
wherever the fuck you go!

15:09.264 --> 15:11.347
- I'm never getting asked
what I want!
- Stop!

15:11.347 --> 15:13.972
God damn it,
it's not my fucking fault!

15:13.972 --> 15:15.846
Yes, this is your fault!

15:15.846 --> 15:18.222
- And you have never
owned up to it!
- God!

15:18.222 --> 15:20.347
You've never said
you're sorry to me...

15:20.347 --> 15:23.305
- Shut the fuck up!
- ...and now I'm the one
that's fucking dead!

15:23.305 --> 15:26.013
- And that is what
is not fucking fair!
- ( grunts )

15:26.013 --> 15:28.930
You wanna know
what I'm doing all day?
I'm being dead!

15:28.930 --> 15:31.055
I can show you
what being dead's like!

15:31.055 --> 15:35.472
- You want me to show you?!
- ( grunts, panting )

15:37.555 --> 15:40.305
( sobbing )

16:14.013 --> 16:15.846

17:05.430 --> 17:07.264
( snoring softly )

17:18.680 --> 17:20.180
You awake?

17:33.180 --> 17:34.721
Is that you?

17:37.555 --> 17:40.097
- Yeah.
- ( chuckles )

17:50.389 --> 17:52.264
( groans )

17:56.264 --> 17:58.763
What happened
to you?

17:58.763 --> 18:00.846
I got old.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.596
What's it look like
happened?

18:02.596 --> 18:05.180
Apparently, you wanted
to see me this way, so.

18:05.180 --> 18:08.721
- Look, I gotta
go soon, but, um...
- Why do you have to go?

18:10.972 --> 18:13.805
Because this is the last time
you're gonna see me.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.347
We can't be friends
anymore.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.138
I'm dead.

18:27.721 --> 18:29.514
Do you
understand that?

18:31.472 --> 18:33.430
You're
42 years old.

18:36.972 --> 18:41.138
You've been standing
on a beach in Florida
for 21 years...

18:42.264 --> 18:43.805
looking out
at the ocean.

18:45.347 --> 18:47.888
I watch you every day,

18:47.888 --> 18:50.472
and I see your family there
behind the dunes

18:50.472 --> 18:52.638
and they're
calling your name.

18:52.638 --> 18:54.430
But you don't answer.

18:55.472 --> 18:56.805
You just stand there...

18:58.305 --> 19:00.305
staring at the ocean.

19:04.846 --> 19:06.638
What are you
doing there, buddy?

19:11.389 --> 19:14.013
I'm just waiting
for you to come back.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.472
Well, I'm not
coming back, pal.

19:20.514 --> 19:23.138
Time for you to turn around
and go home.

19:23.138 --> 19:24.680
( sighs )

19:26.180 --> 19:28.721
I-- I gotta
talk to you first.

19:32.514 --> 19:33.846
Okay.

19:35.514 --> 19:37.305
I'm listening.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.555
You're not gonna
make fun of me?

19:51.389 --> 19:52.721
All right.

19:58.222 --> 20:00.097
I miss you.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.555
And I love you.

20:11.264 --> 20:13.555
And I'm sorry.

20:19.555 --> 20:24.013
Because
I let you down...

20:24.013 --> 20:28.222
( crying )
...and I should've
tried to save you.

20:28.222 --> 20:30.930
If you had tried to save me,
you'd be dead, too.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.264
I should've
gone out there!

20:33.264 --> 20:34.972
( sobs )

20:37.264 --> 20:39.596
I wish
I was with you!

20:41.430 --> 20:43.555
- It's okay.
- ( crying )

20:56.222 --> 20:58.763
- I miss you, too.
- ( sobbing )

20:58.763 --> 21:00.389
And I love you, too.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.930
It wasn't your fault.

21:06.888 --> 21:08.680
It's time to get
off that beach.

21:11.430 --> 21:12.972
Time to go home.
