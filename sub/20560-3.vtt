[theme music plays]

02:14.676 --> 02:16.803
Not looking so good there, Milt.

02:17.762 --> 02:18.847
Trouble sleeping?

02:20.515 --> 02:23.184
I've been sleeping great,
thanks for asking.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.186
Clever, Mr. Gorski.

02:25.895 --> 02:29.274
You mean, for a Chicago cop.

02:30.191 --> 02:33.903
-I underestimated you.
-It's all right, I get that a lot.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.823
Allow me to congratulate you.

02:41.035 --> 02:45.290
He's kind of got this, like,
sad, lonely dog look.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.625
-[laughter]
-Is that your cluster?

02:50.128 --> 02:52.964
That was the longest stakeout of my life

02:53.047 --> 02:56.009
and right now we're just
kind of enjoying this.

02:56.634 --> 02:57.719
You should.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.929
It's a victory.

03:03.683 --> 03:08.354
It's been quite a while since
one of us has gotten to one of them.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.234
-He just said, "one of us."
-[soft laughter]

03:13.318 --> 03:17.071
You and I have more in common
than you'll ever have with any sapien.

03:17.155 --> 03:22.327
Really? That's all you got?
A little... sensorium pride?

03:22.410 --> 03:23.745
Give me some pound, brother.

03:25.788 --> 03:28.333
If that was all I had,
it'd keep me up at night, too.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.129
Hey...

03:34.130 --> 03:35.924
we done bullshitting?

03:37.926 --> 03:39.052
Good.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.055
I know how hierarchies work.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.516
I know there's no way that one of us
is ever gonna be in charge of them.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.771
Which means that your boss, Mr. Croome,
is back there somewhere.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.523
I want him in here. Now.

03:55.276 --> 04:00.031
-You don't understand. These people--
-Oh, we're amateurs. Right.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.534
Nom? Let's give him a taste.

04:03.618 --> 04:04.535
Okay.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.830
His aunt is sick.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.999
An hour ago, he sent "get well" flowers.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.002
Chose the largest of the three options.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.629
Classy.

04:14.712 --> 04:15.880
Very.

04:16.631 --> 04:20.176
Tell him...
we hope his aunt feels better soon.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.932
He wants me to tell you
he hopes your aunt gets well.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.059
-[Amanita] Oh, there's more.
-Huh...

04:28.142 --> 04:31.479
Same florist.
Three dozen black roses to "Rita."

04:36.734 --> 04:39.112
-Naughty boy.
-[typing]

04:39.195 --> 04:40.738
Tell us about Rita.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.160
He wants to know about Rita.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.996
That oughta do it.

04:48.705 --> 04:52.000
What are you hoping to accomplish here,
Will? Blackmail?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.876
No, hardly.

04:56.045 --> 05:00.383
Guys like him...
guys who live behind walls like this,

05:00.466 --> 05:03.344
they get the rules.
You know them, you own them.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.262
[door opens]

05:06.139 --> 05:07.515
Told ya.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.602
All right, Mr. Gorski. Here I am.

05:12.687 --> 05:16.149
You went to a great deal of trouble,
Mr. Gorski, to bring us to this point.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.276
Where do we go from here?

05:19.152 --> 05:23.031
Since he can't hear me, we're gonna have
to play a fun little game of telephone.

05:23.114 --> 05:26.117
Repeat every word I say. First...

05:26.200 --> 05:28.411
First... he wants a meeting.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.497
-And I want it face...
-He wants it face to face.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.415
Is that it?

05:32.498 --> 05:35.460
-He wants it without--
-I want it without old Milt here

05:35.543 --> 05:37.503
creeping around in my head.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.340
I said every word.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.510
-Nom?
-Should I use his private number?

05:44.594 --> 05:45.845
I would.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.725
What he's asking for is unacceptable.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.438
-What's that?
-Sir, it would be a critical mistake.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.399
I am the only advantage in this situation.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.743
From my position, Mr. Gibbons,
you've exaggerated your value.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.747
-No. No.
-How's it feel, Milton?

06:12.830 --> 06:14.248
The Chairman will hear about this.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.792
[shot hissing]

06:19.337 --> 06:20.755
Is that it?

06:30.348 --> 06:31.974
[exhales]

06:33.851 --> 06:36.646
I'm okay. I'm just-- I'm just tired.

06:36.729 --> 06:37.730
You did well.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.150
Oh, my God. Does that mean...?

06:43.402 --> 06:44.779
He's gone.

Are you all right?

08:19.123 --> 08:20.416
I am.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.173
You were singing.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.051
Was I?

08:32.261 --> 08:33.846
Was it a dream?

[humming melody]

08:38.518 --> 08:40.478
Was it about getting out?

Here's our man.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.974
I'm feeling it today, man! I'm feeling it.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.642
That's great, Lito.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.687
I'm having one of those days, man.
I'm on fire.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.485
Oh... [exhales]

09:29.569 --> 09:32.488
Check out this view, man. So beautiful.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.448
I love the city.

-Hello, baby.

Hi, love.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.460
Listen, I know Angels
was a bit of a disappointment,

09:46.544 --> 09:48.129
but I'm already thinking
about the new film

09:48.212 --> 09:50.214
-and I have great ideas for the part.
-Lito.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.884
Listen, he starts out
kind of like a bad guy,

09:53.968 --> 09:55.928
but I think I can give him
a bit of vulnerability

09:56.012 --> 09:59.599
-so he doesn't look too much of a jerk.
-The studio pulled the offer.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.891
What?

10:00.975 --> 10:02.935
They decided to go
in a different direction.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.070
-I thought we had a deal.
-We had dog shit.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.906

the morals clause.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.496
-There's a morals clause?
-Oh, yes.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.458
Look, Lito, it doesn't matter, okay?

10:25.541 --> 10:27.168
The project was shit.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.629
The director: shit.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.921
The screenplay: total shit.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.175
I thought you loved the script.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.927
I loved what you were going
to bring to it.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.973
But the script itself?
I mean, pure fertilizer.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.308
Come on, Lito.

10:42.391 --> 10:46.187
This is good news.
I mean, now we can go after another deal.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.647
A better deal.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.483
See, every year we say no to offers
because you're too busy.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.653
So now, we can say yes.
Pass me that, please.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.072
Here.

Something's wrong.
They're not from this prison.

what he wanted to me.

All they can do is extend my sentence.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.169
That is not a threat to me.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.547
I will take responsibility for this.

[chuckles] Can I drive a bus?

19:39.928 --> 19:41.597
What about the gate clearance?

19:42.097 --> 19:45.350
-Bug?
-I got something. Bit of a jimmy-job.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.393
Go with it.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.774
[man on intercom] I thought you didn't
have a run until the late shift?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.568
We, um...

19:55.569 --> 19:57.279
Are you kidding me? Come on.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.616
Since when did these fucking guys
ever give us a fucking schedule?

20:00.699 --> 20:01.658
That's the truth.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.586
Oh, here's your clearance coming through.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.506
[exhales sharply]

20:16.590 --> 20:18.800
[gate buzzing]

20:28.810 --> 20:31.563
-She-- she's clear?
-Yeah.

20:32.898 --> 20:33.899
Really?

20:33.982 --> 20:35.484
Yeah.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.111
We just helped someone
break out of prison.

20:39.321 --> 20:43.617
-Yeah.
-♪ Born free ♪

20:43.700 --> 20:47.287
-♪ As free as the wind blows ♪
-[laughing]

20:47.371 --> 20:49.498
-♪ Free as... ♪
-So much for normal.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.042
Is that it?

20:52.125 --> 20:54.586
No. They're gonna come after her.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.214
-There'll be helicopters.
-Roadblocks.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.049
We should get rid of the bus.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.593
Find a parking lot.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.720
Agreed.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.022
What are we doing?

21:16.358 --> 21:17.526
Shopping.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.323
Wi-Fi alarm. Too risky.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.745
Perfect.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.178
[door unlocks]

21:46.680 --> 21:48.473
-[grunts]
-[engine starts]

21:48.557 --> 21:52.144
Where did a banker's daughter
learn to be a car thief?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.771
Other lives.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.568
Okay, let's go.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.320
Now what?

22:01.403 --> 22:05.032
-The city has the most hiding places.
-It also has the most cops and cameras.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.368
Right, and her brother's
going to expect her.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.412
We need a place to lay low for a while.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.956
[clears throat]
Are you all right, dear?

22:15.584 --> 22:17.627
When I'm nervous, I talk to myself.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.505
Well... [chuckles]

22:20.589 --> 22:24.634
I don't want to interrupt
what was a very lively conversation,

22:24.718 --> 22:28.805
but I have a friend
who lives not far from here.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.352
Do you trust her?

22:35.145 --> 22:36.730
With my life.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.986
-[clapping]
-[man] Move your asses!

22:45.322 --> 22:47.449
-[man] Yeah! Come on!
-[TV plays indistinctly]

22:47.532 --> 22:50.786
[man] He's free in the middle!
Lewandowski's free!

22:50.869 --> 22:54.206
Come on! [shouts] Yeah!

22:54.289 --> 22:57.125
Right! Let's go. That's my man.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.961
Ooh! Have you seen that?

23:02.631 --> 23:07.010
Well! You there. Volume down.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.346
Are you a Bayern man?

23:09.429 --> 23:11.223
No, no, not at all.

23:11.306 --> 23:14.601
No, I own several players on both teams.

23:14.684 --> 23:17.646
I'm interested in talent, not games.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.064
That's why you are here.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.150
Would you like to have a drink?

23:22.234 --> 23:23.652
-Sure.
-Oh, yeah. He'll have a beer,

23:23.735 --> 23:25.695
-and I'll...
-A beer?

23:26.488 --> 23:29.157
How about this 50-year-old Scotch
over there?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.408
No.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.829
No, I'm joking. Marvelous choice.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.961
-[whistles] Nice crib.
-Thank you.

23:42.796 --> 23:47.926
And speaking of talent, allow me
to introduce my extraordinary right hand.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.075
I would be lost without her.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.583
Lila Facchini.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.376
Pleasure to meet you.

24:21.459 --> 24:25.005
-Lila is Neapolitan.
-Italian?

24:26.464 --> 24:27.340
Neapolitan.

24:27.424 --> 24:31.011
Lila, would you mind grabbing
the contracts from my desk?

24:31.094 --> 24:31.928
Not at all.

24:35.849 --> 24:39.895
So you're just going to sign a huge club
over to people you barely know?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.523
I made a promise. Have a seat.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.067
You showed up. The club is yours.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.360
I own a key shop.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.447
I don't know anything
about running a club.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.699
The last owner never danced,
he never drank,

24:52.782 --> 24:55.285
never partook in any of the reasons
you go to a club.

24:55.368 --> 24:58.371
-Sounds like a waste. [laughs]
-Exactly.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.957
How do you run a restaurant
without ever eating the food?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.042
Boo!

25:03.460 --> 25:05.879
I don't imagine you will make
the same mistake.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.215
Want to play?

25:08.298 --> 25:11.593
[chuckles] Knowing me, I'd find
much bigger mistakes to make.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.802
[Sebastian] I doubt it.

25:12.886 --> 25:16.973
I see this as a tremendous growth
opportunity for both of us.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.979
[Felix chuckles]

25:23.063 --> 25:26.358
[Felix] We just came here because
we thought you were jerking our chain.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.194
[Sebastian] I'm very serious.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.530
If you give me a chance,
I'd like to explain why.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.575
I don't know. He's got somewhere
he's supposed to be and--

25:37.452 --> 25:39.037
Wolfie?

25:39.120 --> 25:40.413
Hey, Wolfie.

25:41.081 --> 25:41.915
Huh?

25:43.166 --> 25:44.626
[Felix] What you think?

25:51.258 --> 25:53.176
Yeah, let's keep talking.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.390
[man] Fresh water!

25:59.015 --> 26:01.059
New water! [whistles]

26:01.142 --> 26:02.477
Clean water!

26:02.560 --> 26:05.021
[whistling]

26:05.105 --> 26:07.190
Fresh water! [whistles]

26:07.274 --> 26:08.775
-Fresh water!
-[Capheus] Ken!

26:11.778 --> 26:12.696
Hey, Capheus.

26:13.738 --> 26:14.906
I'll take two.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.285
Sorry. Prices went up.

26:19.202 --> 26:21.162
-Again?
-Election time.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.290
They gotta fill their pockets.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.000
But people can't take it.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.545
It feels like something got to give.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.634
The competition lacks vision.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.554
I'm not talking about just stupidity,

26:37.637 --> 26:40.348
I'm talking about monkeys
banging on typewriters.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.560
They smuggle girls from Bosnia
or some such place.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.020
They rig football games.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.939
Labor the margins with numbers and drugs.

26:50.483 --> 26:54.529
Talentless chicken thieves
with pickpocket ambition.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.239
Have you played outside your cluster?

26:58.616 --> 26:59.951
-Am I your first?
-Lila, would you mind

27:00.035 --> 27:01.161
passing me the potatoes?

27:05.415 --> 27:06.458
Thanks, darling.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.794
Theirs is the old world. It's...

27:10.462 --> 27:11.880
It's tribal. It's primitive.

27:14.758 --> 27:18.178
The new world is the interconnected world
of global finance.

27:18.261 --> 27:21.222
What is considered illicit today
is commonplace tomorrow.

27:21.306 --> 27:24.851
How can I feel you touching me
if I'm not touching myself?

27:26.728 --> 27:30.273
When you jerk off,
do you think about your hand

27:30.357 --> 27:31.941
or do you think about something else?

27:33.276 --> 27:35.070
I am something else.

27:40.325 --> 27:45.080
Capital exists beyond the auspices
of ethics, morals or even law.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.582
Does it feel this real
because we're so close?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.211
It helps.

27:53.588 --> 27:57.425
Money flows into this fine city constantly
from all over the planet.

27:58.968 --> 28:01.471
I'm not talking about
a trickle or a stream.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.682
-You have to want it.
-Exactly.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.978
Right now, it's a raging flood.

28:09.062 --> 28:12.774
Hey, Wolfie, any idea
what this guy's talking about?

28:12.857 --> 28:16.778
Yeah. International money laundering.
Big scale.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.613
Oh, you're good.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.073
How big?

28:20.824 --> 28:21.825
Billions.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.411
Pretty big.

28:24.494 --> 28:27.539
He's afraid that a gang war
would be bad for business.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.625
Help me and I promise
to make it worth your while.

28:31.459 --> 28:33.002
We might be interested.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.131
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.926
[vehicle approaching]

29:00.155 --> 29:03.283
Oh, trust me, you will not find anything
better at this price point.

29:03.366 --> 29:06.911
Hernando? Hernando? Hernando.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.788
-What?
-It's coming. In the room.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.123
Cars.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.377
-There's cars in the room. Cars.
-Ah! Um...

29:14.461 --> 29:16.337
-Parking?
-No. No, no.

29:16.421 --> 29:20.800
All our inside spots are already taken,
but there's adequate street parking.

29:20.884 --> 29:23.678
"Adequate." An appropriate word.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.264
It... it looked bigger in the pictures.

29:26.347 --> 29:27.515
Yes, a tiny bit.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.728
You said you had one with a balcony?

29:31.811 --> 29:35.982
Oh, yes. It's very charming.
I'm showing it tonight.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.025
Can we see it?

29:37.108 --> 29:38.985
[woman] If you insist.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.453
And, uh, how much did you say this one is?

29:48.536 --> 29:51.790
Beyond your limit.
But you can clearly see why.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.584
-This won't be on the market long.
-[phone rings]

29:54.667 --> 29:57.378
-Feel free to look around.
-Thank you.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.630
Yes?

30:00.131 --> 30:02.342
-[knocks on glass]
-Uh-huh.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.512
Come.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.557
-Come. Come?
-Come.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.644
[clears throat] No.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.652
-I love it.
-I love it, too.

30:20.735 --> 30:21.903
Do you?

30:22.654 --> 30:24.614
-Yes?
-Yeah, I love it.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.617
-It's ours.
-It's twice.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.705
-Twice?
-Yes. Twice.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.915
Twice.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.377
I'm such an idiot.

30:38.211 --> 30:41.172
The first rule of acting:
hold onto your money. But no, no.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.007
I acted as if the train would never stop.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.009
-This is my fault.
-No, it's my fault.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.761
I never carry my share.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.681
-That is not true. You're working.
-It is true.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.391
Lito, come on. I...

30:52.100 --> 30:54.978
Two years ago, the Orozco museum
offered me the job of curator

30:55.061 --> 30:57.981
for three times,
three times what I made as a teacher.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.442
-But you're doing what you love.
-I wanted to teach, "shape young minds."

31:01.526 --> 31:04.195
But you're doing what you love.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.738
And that's important, right?

31:05.822 --> 31:08.783
And I'm doing what I love.
And we love this apartment.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.494
Some-- somehow, it's got to add up.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.206
Oh, my God! Did you see the tub?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.542
Oh, it's huge! We could totally all fit!

31:20.211 --> 31:22.714
I mean, I know we haven't
talked about it.

31:22.797 --> 31:27.093
I mean, I don't mean--
It's just-- this place is perfect.

31:27.176 --> 31:29.512
You could have the big room
and if I gave up my apartment,

31:29.596 --> 31:31.389
it would totally be affordable.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.852
But I mean, no, I just realized--
I'm sorry.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.979
I'm making this huge assumption
and if you want, I'll leave.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.189
Dani, Dani, Dani...

31:43.526 --> 31:49.824
I think that the fact we could all fit
in the tub... means it must be ours.

31:51.659 --> 31:52.619
[all laugh]

32:01.836 --> 32:03.087
[doorbell buzzing]

32:05.965 --> 32:07.550
[doorbell buzzing]

32:08.217 --> 32:10.178
[woman] Yeah? Who is it?

32:10.261 --> 32:11.596
[Min-Jung] It's me.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.441
You...

32:23.524 --> 32:24.734
Come in. Get in.

32:24.817 --> 32:25.860
Get in, get in.

32:26.945 --> 32:27.946
Come on.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.878
Croome said we could have an hour
with Jonas.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.173
I've seen no one watching
or waiting around.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.386
I think it's safe.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.472
Why would Jonas pick this place?

32:57.100 --> 32:57.934
[sighs]

33:00.019 --> 33:02.230
[Riley] I'll keep an eye on you
from across the bridge.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.412
Oh, my fucking God.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.581
Yes, my new surroundings
are less than salubrious.

33:21.165 --> 33:24.919
I couldn't understand why they
were bothering to keep me alive...

33:25.878 --> 33:28.381
until I realized you were still free.

33:29.757 --> 33:32.635
How you managed that
after being seen by Whispers,

33:32.719 --> 33:34.971
I'm not sure I'll ever understand.

33:35.054 --> 33:37.432
I know what manhunts cost.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.517
I knew eventually someone
higher up the food chain

33:39.600 --> 33:41.227
would hold Whispers accountable.

33:42.020 --> 33:42.937
Well done.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.607
Why'd you want to meet here, Jonas?

33:46.691 --> 33:50.069
I wasn't sure if they'd try to trace me
to our conversation.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.823
Here, at least, you could disappear
on any one of these trains, quickly.

33:54.741 --> 33:58.536
There's train stations everywhere, though.
Why this one?

33:59.787 --> 34:01.205
You are a good cop.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.378
It was very different
when I first came here.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.131
But then, so am I, so...

34:11.549 --> 34:14.010
maybe this version makes more sense.

34:14.093 --> 34:16.846
We forget so much more than we remember.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.515
Maybe we need to.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.852
Maybe that's what makes it bearable.

34:25.104 --> 34:26.814
What happened here?

34:28.816 --> 34:30.359
[Jonas] I had just got off the train...

34:31.569 --> 34:33.488
thought about getting on another...

34:34.989 --> 34:36.657
when I saw him.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.534
Who?

34:38.618 --> 34:40.620
My father.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.599
What a mad, wonderful man he was.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.851
He passed?

35:05.186 --> 35:06.187
Cancer.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.439
A rarity for us.

35:10.358 --> 35:13.152
But he went surrounded
by all his children.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.404
Some 80 of us.

35:22.995 --> 35:24.831
It felt fucking biblical.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.960
So any gender can give birth to a cluster?

35:29.043 --> 35:32.755
Correct. We can also give birth
at any time in our lives.

35:32.839 --> 35:35.633
This is one of the things
that terrifies them the most about us:

35:35.716 --> 35:37.510
potential population growth.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.303
I read about this.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.973
So how many of us are there?

35:42.056 --> 35:45.143
Estimates vary from the thousands
to tens of thousands.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.894
-But rising?
-Oh, yes.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.563
-Why?
-Why?

35:48.646 --> 35:50.439
Epigenetic factors.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.650
So, does that mean anyone
can be born sensate?

35:52.733 --> 35:53.734
No.

35:53.818 --> 35:57.530
Angelica could explain it more clearly,
but it's genetically encoded.

35:57.613 --> 35:59.949
If it's a genetic disposition,

36:00.032 --> 36:03.661
does that mean Angelica identified
specific genes?

36:03.744 --> 36:08.207
I know you've all got a lot of questions,
but shouldn't we prioritize a little?

36:08.291 --> 36:09.458
I was.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.085
I have quite a list.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.171
Ask him about the rest of his cluster.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.715
What about your cluster?

36:17.091 --> 36:18.676
I am our last.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.305
BPO.

36:23.472 --> 36:25.641
Most of us, yes. Not all.

36:25.725 --> 36:28.769
And what about Angelica's first cluster?

36:28.853 --> 36:30.897
I'd never met anyone like Angelica.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.904
[Jonas] I thought at first
the sensate connection I experienced

36:37.987 --> 36:39.947
had something to do with the building.

36:40.031 --> 36:45.369
I came back to try and understand
if I was losing my mind, and I found her.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.954
[Angelica] How can this be?

36:48.706 --> 36:53.586
[whispering] You're here,
and I can touch you. You're in my head.

37:03.429 --> 37:09.644
She experienced things with such...
open, honest joy.

37:09.727 --> 37:14.440
[moaning]

37:21.948 --> 37:23.449
I can see them.

37:23.532 --> 37:25.701
After the birthing, she was so happy,

37:25.785 --> 37:28.913
I thought she'd float away
like a loose balloon.

37:28.996 --> 37:32.083
[indistinct chatter]

37:33.960 --> 37:36.045
Come here. Look at this.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.840
But not every sensate
is happy being born like us.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.051
His name was Todd.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.887
He hated what he was.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.932
[Todd] Please help me. Please...

37:48.975 --> 37:50.935
They can fix us. They can make us normal.

37:52.270 --> 37:56.023
-Todd, we are normal.
-No.

37:57.441 --> 38:00.403
[Jonas] One by one,
they disappeared from us.

38:01.362 --> 38:04.282
The last one was the only one I'd met.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.828
He was a reporter from Mexico.

38:08.911 --> 38:11.122
Have you ever heard of
quantum entanglement?

38:11.205 --> 38:16.294
Particles respond to the same stimuli
across huge distances.

38:17.753 --> 38:20.047
Will you teach me to talk to trees?

38:20.131 --> 38:23.384
[Jonas] He was just like her.
His name was Raoul.

38:25.761 --> 38:28.639
Raoul? Raoul Pasquale?

38:30.391 --> 38:32.143
Did you know him?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.396
I did.

38:36.063 --> 38:38.274
He interviewed me a long time ago.

38:42.236 --> 38:43.779
We had a connection.

38:44.905 --> 38:47.074
I remember when he disappeared.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.661
Angelica went to Chicago
searching for him.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.999
That's how she began working
with Whispers.

38:56.876 --> 39:00.713
I'd love to stay and chat, but I fear
visiting hours have come to an end.

39:00.796 --> 39:05.217
Jonas... I need to understand how much
leverage we've got with this guy Croome.

39:05.301 --> 39:09.221
There's something going on inside BPO.
Some kind of internal struggle.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.223
They are, like many of us
in our institutions,

39:11.307 --> 39:15.227
-going through an identity crisis.
-What are they fighting over?

39:15.311 --> 39:17.646
I suspect Mr. Croome
can answer that better than I.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.607
What I do know is there's
always an "us and them"

39:19.690 --> 39:21.859
even inside a tightly controlled "them"
like BPO.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.736
I don't trust him.

39:23.819 --> 39:28.908
But right now, worry about yourselves.
And Croome. Do not trust any of them.

39:28.991 --> 39:32.203
It's like you hooked a lizard
inside the snake pit.

39:32.286 --> 39:34.914
Croome may not be as dangerous
as the rest of them,

39:34.997 --> 39:36.957
but in the end he's just as cold-blooded.

39:37.041 --> 39:40.753
-[shot hisses]
-[gasps]

39:40.836 --> 39:41.670
Jonas.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.272
Mm...

40:00.356 --> 40:02.149
Oh, my God, it's so good.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.443
Mm. She used to own a restaurant.

40:04.527 --> 40:07.113
Down in Busan. Nothing fancy.

40:09.115 --> 40:13.577
I remember after I gave birth
to our son,

40:13.661 --> 40:16.205
oh, you could say we were happy.

40:16.747 --> 40:17.581
But...

40:18.624 --> 40:25.339
But then, I discovered my husband
liked to gamble. A lot.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.465
Mm-hm.

40:26.549 --> 40:30.678
Soon he was in debt to some dangerous men.

40:30.761 --> 40:36.517
He lost the bar and had a breakdown
and threw himself under a train. Stupid.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.394
I'm sorry.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.979
Oh, don't be.

40:40.062 --> 40:43.691
Now, I was in debt to those dangerous men.

40:43.774 --> 40:48.946
They told me, "Take a holiday
across the water in Japan, take a ferry,

40:49.029 --> 40:51.782
take your son, and take a suitcase.

40:51.866 --> 40:56.704
Take ten of these holidays,
and then we'll forgive your debt."

40:58.372 --> 41:02.001
For nine holidays,
everything went smoothly.

41:02.084 --> 41:06.964
But on the tenth trip,
when I got off the boat at Busan...

41:08.340 --> 41:10.384
police were waiting.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.386
That's how we met.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.931
-Mm-hm. [laughs]
-Mm-hm. That's very true.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.685
But after I was finally
released from prison...

41:20.644 --> 41:23.647
my son hardly knew me.

41:25.649 --> 41:29.320
He still feel ashamed
of his drug-smuggling mother.

41:31.697 --> 41:34.533
One day, he will understand.

41:39.788 --> 41:45.002
And now, life is a big trap
made up of little traps.

41:45.669 --> 41:47.379
If you listen hard...

41:48.380 --> 41:52.259
sometimes you could hear them snap shut.

42:42.309 --> 42:44.019
[Croome] Rembrandt.

42:44.103 --> 42:46.355
His name is synonymous with "masterpiece."

42:46.438 --> 42:49.650
And this,
arguably one of his greatest paintings.

42:49.733 --> 42:53.404
An iconic work of individuals
setting aside their differences

42:53.487 --> 42:55.948
for a common good. [chuckles]

42:58.158 --> 43:01.203
Yet, in its day,
this painting was ridiculed,

43:01.287 --> 43:03.914
called "a mess," "the work of an amateur."

43:03.998 --> 43:06.542
There were stories about the gents
who hired Rembrandt

43:06.625 --> 43:09.878
refusing to pay because
they were unhappy with their likenesses.

43:09.962 --> 43:15.676
The painting was so unappreciated that
when they moved from one hall to another,

43:15.759 --> 43:17.761
they decided it was too big,

43:17.845 --> 43:22.641
so they just slashed chunks
off the bottom and the side.

43:22.725 --> 43:25.644
This amputation is what we have left.

43:26.812 --> 43:29.023
And we built an entire museum around it.

43:34.820 --> 43:36.488
What changed?

43:38.490 --> 43:40.784
The painting is still the painting.

43:40.868 --> 43:44.747
But what we see is not what people saw
hundreds of years ago.

43:44.830 --> 43:47.374
How we see changes.

43:49.001 --> 43:50.711
The same is true for our ears.

43:50.794 --> 43:53.881
The music of Mozart was not heard
by the people of his time

43:53.964 --> 43:55.799
the way we hear it today.

43:56.759 --> 43:57.635
Why?

43:58.510 --> 44:03.724
Because our senses,
including our common sense, are evolving.

44:06.852 --> 44:09.730
And I think that is because
of people like you.

44:12.566 --> 44:16.570
If BPO thinks the way you do,
why all the secrecy and control?

44:17.946 --> 44:20.991
Obviously, not everyone thinks like I do.

44:21.617 --> 44:24.203
What do they want that's different
from what you want?

44:26.497 --> 44:28.624
How much do you know about BPO?

44:28.707 --> 44:32.211
Biologic Preservation Organization.
Began in the early '60s by...

44:32.294 --> 44:34.254
...Ruth El-Saadawi.

44:35.130 --> 44:36.715
An incredible woman.

44:37.424 --> 44:40.386
One of the great scientific minds
of our time.

44:41.595 --> 44:45.599
She believed sapiens and sensorium
to be obligate mutualisms,

44:45.683 --> 44:48.310
dependent on one another for survival.

44:48.977 --> 44:51.522
BPO was founded by her

44:51.605 --> 44:55.234
and dedicated to her vision
of natural and ethical balance.

44:56.068 --> 44:59.029
That doesn't sound like the same
organization we know from Iceland.

44:59.947 --> 45:00.989
No.

45:02.574 --> 45:04.118
So what changed?

45:05.369 --> 45:09.998
The same thing that changed
for the rest of the world... 9/11.

45:11.875 --> 45:15.879
The end of the Cold War mutated
into the endless War on Terror.

45:15.963 --> 45:19.425
And whether we're talking
about spies or terrorists,

45:19.508 --> 45:24.972
sensates, by their nature,
are a threat to secrecy and sovereignty.

45:26.598 --> 45:28.016
Hm...

45:28.100 --> 45:30.185
In that group of differing soldiers,

45:30.269 --> 45:35.441
there's only one pair of eyes looking to
the flag, looking to the bigger picture.

45:37.317 --> 45:39.611
Those eyes are the eyes
of Rembrandt himself,

45:39.695 --> 45:42.489
hidden there, behind everyone.

45:43.615 --> 45:46.410
His eyes are looking to the future.

45:47.744 --> 45:50.372
And that's exactly where I'm looking.

45:53.083 --> 45:55.961
There's a strong group of us inside BPO.

45:56.044 --> 46:00.132
We believe we can change
the present direction of the organization

46:00.215 --> 46:03.051
back to the vision of Dr. El-Saadawi.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.682
What I want from you is time.

46:09.766 --> 46:11.101
And trust.

46:16.482 --> 46:17.733
These are psi-blockers,

46:17.816 --> 46:21.403
the same pills Milton takes
to immunize himself for a period of time.

46:22.029 --> 46:24.114
Consider it a token of goodwill.

46:25.866 --> 46:29.328
And a down payment for a better future
for both of us.

46:50.140 --> 46:51.975
[grunting, shouting]

46:53.769 --> 46:55.187
Hello, Will.

47:02.528 --> 47:06.073
[grunting]

47:08.659 --> 47:10.202
Ahh!

47:23.090 --> 47:25.133
[grunts]
