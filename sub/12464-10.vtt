00:05.005 --> 00:06.839
Hey, honey.

00:06.841 --> 00:09.241
Check out my latest innovation
in tree decorating.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.844
I built a base
that turns the tree

00:11.846 --> 00:13.579
so you can decorate it easier.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.781
I call it

00:15.783 --> 00:18.250
"the tree-zy Susan."

00:19.185 --> 00:20.519
Yep.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.588
After just three weeks
in the wood shop,

00:22.590 --> 00:25.124
dad has shaved five minutes

00:25.126 --> 00:26.592
off our decorating time.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.162
I finished my
Christmas wish list, mommy.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.167
The trick to getting what you
really want for Christmas

00:35.169 --> 00:37.636
is to first ask
for the impossible.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.304
I throw in a "mommy" or two

00:39.306 --> 00:40.572
to grease the wheels.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.308
I only want one thing, mommy.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.246
Peace on earth,
good will toward men.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.716
( Sighs ) Sorry,
I guess that's two things.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.719
Well, they're a little tough

00:53.721 --> 00:55.320
to wrap and put under the tree.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.822
What else is on your list?

00:56.824 --> 01:00.225
Well, I didn't think
I'd need a backup,

01:00.227 --> 01:02.394
but I guess I could
settle for...

01:02.396 --> 01:04.797
The screaming dragon
remote pilot helicopter

01:04.799 --> 01:07.800
with a built-in
13-megapixel camera.

01:09.702 --> 01:11.603
Well,
they're kind of expensive.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.974
But I think we can
get you that helicopter.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.111
That's how you get 'er done,
son.

01:20.046 --> 01:21.246
Oh, please.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.649
Letting Parker think
he's "working us"

01:23.651 --> 01:25.584
has become
a Christmas tradition.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.787
Last year he asked us to fill
in the hole in the ozone layer.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.189
He got a bike.

01:31.791 --> 01:34.059
Seriously?
A helicopter?

01:34.061 --> 01:36.261
He's just gonna break it
in the first 15 minutes.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.130
May as well flush
your money down the toilet.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.932
Oh, wait, you can't.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.333
His remote control submarine

01:41.335 --> 01:43.168
already clogged it.

01:44.904 --> 01:46.672
Mm, I hadn't
thought about that.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.140
Operation toilet dive

01:48.142 --> 01:49.908
was a search and rescue mission

01:49.910 --> 01:52.644
for the action figure
I flushed the day before.

01:54.013 --> 01:57.049
Never leave a man behind.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.251
Yeah, you're not helping
your case here.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.687
I hate to say it,
but I think Joey's right.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.988
You're just too young

02:02.990 --> 02:04.656
for such a sophisticated toy.

02:06.192 --> 02:07.793
All I want for Christmas now

02:07.795 --> 02:09.394
is revenge.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.929
And the helicopter.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.264
And the peace on earth stuff,

02:12.266 --> 02:13.799
but mostly revenge.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.334
And the helicopter.

02:16.936 --> 02:18.137
Dad, come on.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.805
Joey's ruining Christmas.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.073
Do something.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.312
I'm a little tied up
right now, buddy.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.314
<i>( Theme music plays )</i>

02:29.316 --> 02:31.183

03:18.765 --> 03:20.065
Oh, I am so excited

03:20.067 --> 03:21.800
that you're headlining
channel four's

03:21.802 --> 03:23.268
holiday spectacular.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.904
Partly because
it's great for the town,

03:25.906 --> 03:27.372
but mostly because
I'd already told the committee

03:27.374 --> 03:29.341
you'd say yes.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.810
I mean, how can I say no?

03:31.812 --> 03:32.911
This is where it all began

03:32.913 --> 03:33.912
eight years ago.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.415
My little baby's first time

03:36.417 --> 03:39.284
singing her little heart out.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.420
I still remember
how you wowed the crowd

03:41.422 --> 03:42.955
with "frosty the snowman."

03:43.923 --> 03:46.058
And "white Christmas."

03:46.060 --> 03:49.027
And "little drummer boy."

03:49.029 --> 03:51.430
By the time you'd finished
"o little town of Bethlehem,"

03:51.432 --> 03:53.899
I felt like I'd
walked there myself.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.368
I never wanted it to end.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.203
And it almost didn't.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.206
Liv Rooney?

04:02.408 --> 04:03.542
Hi.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.444
- I'm Jenny keene.
- Hi.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.279
You are the adorable
little girl

04:07.281 --> 04:08.880
that I get to share
the stage with

04:08.882 --> 04:10.382
this Christmas Eve.

04:10.384 --> 04:14.419
and you have some
serious pipes, young lady.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.522
It feels so good
to be talented, doesn't it?

04:17.524 --> 04:19.958
I want to be just like you

04:19.960 --> 04:22.361
when I grow up.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.830
Well, you are certainly
on the right track.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.765
Eight years ago, I was you.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.167
I was a starry-eyed
little girl,

04:29.169 --> 04:31.203
excited to make
her first TV appearance.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.304
( Giggles )

04:32.306 --> 04:33.472
And I mean, after this show,

04:33.474 --> 04:35.407
my life changed forever.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.475
It's true.
Without it,

04:36.477 --> 04:37.876
Liv never would have been cast

04:37.878 --> 04:39.011
in a local commercial

04:39.013 --> 04:40.479
as Mandy, the singing muffler.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.147
( Clears throat )

04:42.149 --> 04:43.348
¶ Mandy says

04:43.350 --> 04:45.450
¶ your muffler is a-okay.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.885
- ( Clicks teeth )
- ( Chuckles )

04:46.887 --> 04:48.487
We still get a discount.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.823
But I didn't really
have anyone to guide me,

04:51.825 --> 04:53.292
so I wanted to be that for you.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.027
You know, this industry
can get kind of tough,

04:55.029 --> 04:56.328
and it's good to have a mentor.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.997
I can't believe Liv Rooney's

04:58.999 --> 05:01.533
going to be
my celebrity mentor.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.435
Oh, stop.
Celebrity mentor?

05:03.437 --> 05:05.437
( Chuckles )
You don't have to say that...

05:05.439 --> 05:06.571
I mean, you definitely can.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.807
I'm not gonna stop you.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.045
Ho ho ho.

05:13.047 --> 05:16.281
No no no.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.517
Dude, what's with the suit?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.952
I have a plan to turn
Christmas cheer

05:20.954 --> 05:23.355
into Christmas ka-ching.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.159
Ka-ching just bought you
15 seconds.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.527
Impress me.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.329
Okay.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.997
So they do that
holiday spectacular

05:31.999 --> 05:33.298
tree lighting ceremony
in the park

05:33.300 --> 05:34.966
next to ridgewood high.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.135
But do you know
what they don't have?

05:37.137 --> 05:40.339
Seven more seconds
to impress me?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.908
A Santa stand.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.977
Adorable kids
plus sentimental parents

05:45.979 --> 05:48.246
equals cold hard cash.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.314
Whoa.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.383
You actually had a good idea.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.118
It's a Christmas miracle.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.621
Yeah, well, I spent too much
on Christmas presents this year

05:56.623 --> 05:58.290
and I owe dad some money.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.492
I need your help.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.227
So...

06:02.229 --> 06:02.729
You in?

06:05.298 --> 06:08.300
Keep your friends close
and your jerky brother closer.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.968
If I can't play with
the helicopter

06:09.970 --> 06:11.103
until I break it,

06:11.105 --> 06:12.371
I'm gonna play with Joey

06:12.373 --> 06:13.572
until I break him.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.074
A little quality time

06:16.076 --> 06:18.543
with my big bro
on Christmas Eve?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.544
You bet.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.246
( Chuckles )

06:21.248 --> 06:23.181
This is channel four
meteorologist

06:23.183 --> 06:25.183
Johnny nimbus
coming at you live

06:25.185 --> 06:27.652
from the sight of
tomorrow's holiday spectacular.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.454
And I'm here alongside
Pete Rooney,

06:29.456 --> 06:31.390
the chairman of
the Stevens point

06:31.392 --> 06:32.391
tree lighting committee.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.126
Now, Pete, I see a tree,

06:34.128 --> 06:35.660
not a lot of lights.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.295
Don't leave us in the dark.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.563
( Laughs )

06:38.565 --> 06:42.167
Classic nimbus.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.770
But seriously,
what have you got planned?

06:52.278 --> 06:53.311
Are we on the air now,

06:53.313 --> 06:54.646
like, now now?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.314
Now?

06:56.316 --> 06:58.483
Hi.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.185
Uh, yeah we're live

07:00.187 --> 07:01.720
to over 50,000 viewers.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.522
Although I think
that number drops

07:03.524 --> 07:05.924
every second you stand there
like a frozen snowman.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.460
Excuse me, Johnny.
Hi.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.462
I'm Maddie Rooney,
co-chair.

07:10.464 --> 07:14.332
And think I could
shed some light on that.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.334
( Laughs )

07:16.336 --> 07:18.236
Classic Maddie.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.438
( Sighs )

07:19.440 --> 07:22.107
So we envision a tree
completely lit

07:22.109 --> 07:23.308
by candles.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.178
And we call it
"Christmas unplugged."

07:26.180 --> 07:28.647
Hmm.
"Christmas unplugged."

07:28.649 --> 07:30.449
Well, last year
the griswold family

07:30.451 --> 07:32.250
lit their tree with lasers

07:32.252 --> 07:34.319
and then they had a
stealth bomber fly over

07:34.321 --> 07:35.954
and drop tinsel, but hey...

07:35.956 --> 07:38.523
I guess not everybody
has to try.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.325
- So...
- Uh, wait.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.327
You didn't let me finish.

07:42.329 --> 07:45.330
We were going to do
the thing that I just said,

07:45.332 --> 07:47.399
but then we changed our minds

07:47.401 --> 07:49.668
and came up with
something bigger and better

07:49.670 --> 07:52.337
and more awesome-er.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.672
All right.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.208
That's what Stevens point
wants to hear.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.342
Come on, give me the deets.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.010
What have you got planned?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.412
Merry Christmas.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.182
Well, Johnny,

08:04.184 --> 08:06.451
I think we're trying
to keep our master plan

08:06.453 --> 08:08.186
kind of under wraps right now.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.188
But I can promise you

08:10.190 --> 08:11.323
that the Rooney tree

08:11.325 --> 08:13.191
is going to be
the biggest and the best

08:13.193 --> 08:15.393
that Stevens point
has ever seen.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.428
Bam, what?!

08:16.430 --> 08:18.196
Oh-ho!

08:18.198 --> 08:20.599
All right. You heard
it from Maddie Rooney.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.667
Boom, zap!

08:22.669 --> 08:24.736
So don't forget to come
on down tomorrow night

08:24.738 --> 08:26.571
and see this amazing tree

08:26.573 --> 08:28.340
in the snow.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.608
That's right.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.343
Rebel meteorologist
Johnny nimbus

08:31.345 --> 08:33.345
is ignoring
the mega doppler radar,

08:33.347 --> 08:35.413
and every other station in town

08:35.415 --> 08:38.350
to guarantee you
a white Christmas.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.784
Nimbus out.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.320
- Great job, kid.
- Thanks.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.722
( Groans )

08:45.391 --> 08:46.525
What did I just do?

08:46.527 --> 08:48.059
I just promised
that we could top

08:48.061 --> 08:49.594
the griswolds' tinsel flyby.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.263
Why did I just promise that?

08:51.265 --> 08:53.465
Next time, just let
me do the talking.

08:57.436 --> 09:00.605
¶ Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go ¶

09:00.607 --> 09:04.209
¶ ho ho ho, who wouldn't go ¶

09:04.211 --> 09:07.345
¶ up on the housetop
click click click ¶

09:07.347 --> 09:10.649
¶ down through the chimney
with good Saint Nick. ¶

09:10.651 --> 09:12.183
( squeals )

09:12.185 --> 09:14.486
Jenny, that was so great.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.355
That means everything

09:17.357 --> 09:19.357
coming from you, Liv.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.193
Well between this duet
and Liv's solo,

09:22.195 --> 09:25.263
this is going to be the best
tree lighting ceremony ever.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.465
Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Rooney,

09:27.467 --> 09:29.334
for your wonderful
flute playing.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.137
It's like listening to beauty

09:32.139 --> 09:34.372
share a hug with grace.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.142
Well, thank you, Jenny.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.810
You know, I was
a bit of a triple threat

09:38.812 --> 09:40.345
in high school myself.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.514
Flute, Baton twirling,

09:42.516 --> 09:44.716
and flag spinning.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.418
Pep squad in the house.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.356
Once you've mastered
the flag twirl,

09:51.358 --> 09:53.224
you never forget.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.759
It's in my bones.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.363
Well, I'm gonna go
check on dinner.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.365
Now you girls keep practicing.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.466
You sound great.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.335
Aww.
Everyone sounds great

10:03.337 --> 10:04.803
when they're singing with Liv.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.671
( Giggles )

10:06.673 --> 10:10.442
Because you sound like
a dying walrus.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.210
( Chuckles )

10:12.212 --> 10:14.212
You are just too sweet.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.847
Wait, what?

10:15.849 --> 10:17.349
Listen up, blondie.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.683
I'm making some changes

10:18.685 --> 10:21.419
starting with this
stupid outfit.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.487
I'm the star of the show.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.322
I should have the cool dress!

10:25.691 --> 10:26.891
Um...

10:26.893 --> 10:29.394
I'm pretty sure
I'm the star of the show.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.695
I am the one lighting the tree,

10:30.697 --> 10:32.430
oh, and also I'm the one

10:32.432 --> 10:33.665
who had her own hit TV show.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.700
If you try
to steal my spotlight,

10:35.702 --> 10:39.304
I will chew you up
and spit you out.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.239
Mrs. Rooney.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.476
Could you drive me home?

10:44.478 --> 10:46.645
I promised mommy
I'd read to grandpa tonight.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.614
Well, you are just
too good to be true.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.282
Sure, I was just gonna
get some things for dinner.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.350
Let's go.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.819
Not before I get
a hug from Liv.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.354
( Giggles )

10:56.356 --> 10:57.756
Watch your back.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.326
( Giggles )

11:06.432 --> 11:07.699
Oh.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.300
That girl is such an angel.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.403
She insisted that
I give you these cookies.

11:11.405 --> 11:12.904
( Gasps ) Mom!

11:12.906 --> 11:15.373
Don't eat those.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.176
Now I know we watch our
carbs around the holidays,

11:18.178 --> 11:19.944
but what was that?

11:19.946 --> 11:21.913
Jenny keene is a monster.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.181
Yeah.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.382
One minute it's

11:24.384 --> 11:26.351
"beauty sharing
a hug with grace,"

11:26.353 --> 11:29.654
and the next it's
"watch your back."

11:32.224 --> 11:33.825
Honey, that can't be true.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.360
During the ride home,
she sang me

11:35.362 --> 11:36.461
"the 12 days of Christmas,"

11:36.463 --> 11:37.696
complimented my shoes,

11:37.698 --> 11:39.531
and offered me gas money.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.699
Ha!
She's a liar.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.866
Your shoes are hideous.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.236
Honey...

11:45.238 --> 11:47.372
Imagine how scared
that little girl must be

11:47.374 --> 11:49.741
to share a spotlight
with Liv Rooney.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.244
Yeah.
( Chuckles )

11:53.246 --> 11:54.713
I guess you're right.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.749
Must be so cold there
in my shadow.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.321
Look, this is what being
a mentor is all about.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.390
That little girl
needs your guidance.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.692
I guess everybody gets
nervous in different ways.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.427
You know, some people
chew their fingernails,

12:09.429 --> 12:11.463
and other people
turn into a demon spawn.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.365
Well, let's cheer ourselves up.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.700
We can watch
the clip of your dad

12:15.702 --> 12:17.435
freezing up on the news again.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.372
Merry Christmas.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.441
( Both laugh )

12:26.712 --> 12:27.979
( Clears throat )

12:27.981 --> 12:29.547
Status update, dad?

12:29.549 --> 12:32.584
I've strung seven and a half
Miles of tree lights,

12:32.586 --> 12:35.386
hardwired her into the main
power grid to the school,

12:35.388 --> 12:38.490
and duct taped
19 power strips together.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.592
( Grunts )

12:40.594 --> 12:42.527
We are gonna blow
the griswolds away.

12:42.529 --> 12:46.264
Check out the awesome
tree topper I found.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.699
You...
( Chuckles )

12:47.701 --> 12:49.300
You might need these.

12:53.706 --> 12:56.574
Whoa.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.444
Every superhero in the world

12:59.446 --> 13:01.112
is gonna report
to Stevens point

13:01.114 --> 13:02.447
this Christmas Eve.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.715
Go rooneys.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.385
- ( Grunts )
- Yeah.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.053
Run along now.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.389
Merry Christmas.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.490
I have to hand it to you,

13:12.492 --> 13:14.058
setting up
right next to the park

13:14.060 --> 13:15.460
was genius.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.995
Why don't you run over there

13:16.997 --> 13:18.396
and round up
some more customers,

13:18.398 --> 13:19.731
my good elf?

13:19.733 --> 13:21.065
You got it,

13:21.067 --> 13:22.967
Mr. kringle.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.871
Oh, how I wanted
to shove fake snow

13:26.873 --> 13:29.707
in that stupid
jolly face of his.

13:29.709 --> 13:32.043
But first, I was
gonna mess with him.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.778
And frankly,
the tips were great.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.082
Whoa-ho-ho!

13:38.084 --> 13:40.485
Santa's lap is not a toilet.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.390
That is like
the fifth kid to do that.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.591
What is going on here?

13:47.726 --> 13:49.460
Free apple cider.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.462
Remember, you cannot
get on Santa's lap

13:51.464 --> 13:54.065
until you drink
every last drop.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.470
Good...

13:59.472 --> 14:01.472
Evening, Stevens point!

14:01.474 --> 14:02.574
And...

14:02.576 --> 14:04.142
Welcome to the channel four

14:04.144 --> 14:06.744

holiday spectacular.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.746
Brought to you

14:08.748 --> 14:11.416
your schmear
for Christmas cheer.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.051
Mmm!

14:13.053 --> 14:14.719
Delicious.
Hey, everybody,

14:14.721 --> 14:15.920
I'm Johnny nimbus.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.388
The only weatherman

14:17.390 --> 14:18.923
guaranteeing you

14:18.925 --> 14:21.726
a white Christmas.
That's right.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.394
No other channel's
predicting snow.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.996
Why you gotta hate,
channel eight?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.464
( Laughs )

14:26.466 --> 14:27.832
Cue my snow.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.400
- Come on.
- ( Applause )

14:29.402 --> 14:31.469
Here it comes.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.072
Any minute now.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.740
All right, it's coming, folks.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.742
Don't worry about it,
but hey, right now,

14:37.744 --> 14:39.410
I want you to give it up

14:39.412 --> 14:42.080
for hometown sweetheart
Liv Rooney

14:42.082 --> 14:43.715
and newcomer Jenny keene.

14:46.085 --> 14:49.120
¶ Up on the housetop

14:49.122 --> 14:52.457
¶ out jumps good old
Santa claus ¶

14:52.459 --> 14:55.460

14:55.462 --> 14:59.063
¶ all for the little ones,
Christmas joys ¶

14:59.065 --> 15:02.133
how dare that
ungrateful little reindeer

15:02.135 --> 15:04.736
come out wearing the same
cutie claus outfit as me.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.804
And look cuter than me in it.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.842
¶ Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go ¶

15:10.844 --> 15:14.178
¶ ho ho ho, who wouldn't go ¶

15:14.180 --> 15:17.615

15:21.553 --> 15:23.154
oops. I think I just
landed myself

15:23.156 --> 15:24.822
on the naughty list.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.525
¶ Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go ¶

<i>( applause )</i>

15:41.740 --> 15:43.174
( Cheering )

15:50.916 --> 15:54.552
I don't know when you and Jenny
worked out that comedy routine,

15:54.554 --> 15:55.653
<i>but it was hysterical.</i>

15:55.655 --> 15:56.688
( Laughs )

15:56.690 --> 15:58.022
No, that wasn't planned.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.490
She was trying to destroy me.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.626
( Snorts ) Come on, Liv.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.962
That sweet little girl
was not trying to destroy you.

16:03.964 --> 16:07.665
Did you all not just see
the candy cane beat down?

16:09.234 --> 16:11.636
She was doing absolutely
everything she could

16:11.638 --> 16:12.770
to make me look bad.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.539
Give her a break, Liv.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.607
Do you not remember
how you were at her age?

16:16.609 --> 16:19.477
I was not a monster like that.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.414
- I have to go get wardrobe.
- Got to work on that tree.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.084
( Camera shutter clicks )

16:26.086 --> 16:28.219
( Sighs )

16:28.221 --> 16:31.622
Ho ho ho.

16:31.624 --> 16:35.760
So you are the last kid
on Santa's lap.

16:35.762 --> 16:36.894
What are you gonna do?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.830
Pee on me, spit in my face,

16:38.832 --> 16:40.031
pour itching powder
down my suit,

16:40.033 --> 16:41.233
throw my glasses in the bushes?

16:41.234 --> 16:43.835
I have seen it all today, kid.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.839
Just pick one and do it quick.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.508
( Blows )

16:52.778 --> 16:54.245
Blowing your nose in my beard

16:54.247 --> 16:55.747
was not an option.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.115
Get off of me.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.284
( Groans )

17:03.155 --> 17:04.288
Parker, there you are.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.957
Here's 10 bucks.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.091
Add it to the pot.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.159
How much did we end up with?

17:08.161 --> 17:10.094
Including the 10 bucks,

17:10.096 --> 17:12.764
that would be...
( Mouths )

17:12.766 --> 17:13.865
10 bucks.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.101
What?

17:17.103 --> 17:18.770
They've been handing you money
all afternoon.

17:18.772 --> 17:19.804
Where did it go?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.572
I'm sorry.
I meant 10 bucks

17:21.574 --> 17:22.974
and this.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.044
( Helicopter whirs )

17:31.683 --> 17:35.553
One screaming dragon
helicopter.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.755
You used all of our Santa money

17:37.757 --> 17:40.324
and bought yourself
the helicopter?

17:40.326 --> 17:42.226
I also paid kids to pee on you,

17:42.228 --> 17:44.695
spit in your face, pour itching
powder down your suit,

17:44.697 --> 17:48.032
and throw your glasses
into the bushes.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.568
Why?

17:50.570 --> 17:52.837
Because mom was gonna
get that helicopter for me

17:52.839 --> 17:54.605
until you wrecked my dream.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.107
Welcome to Christmas revenge.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.309
Ho-ho-how you like me now?

18:00.245 --> 18:02.980
The only reason
I did this Santa stand

18:02.982 --> 18:05.683
was so I could pay off
your Christmas present.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.586
( Grunts )

18:08.588 --> 18:10.755
I talked mom out of
getting you that helicopter

18:10.757 --> 18:13.925
'cause I already
got it for you.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.628
I'm sorry, munch.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.063
I had no idea you cared.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.099
Me either.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.366
I guess it's just
the Christmas spirit.

18:22.368 --> 18:23.634
Come on.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.840
Are you hugging me
because you love me,

18:28.842 --> 18:31.242
or because you're
covered in kid pee?

18:32.845 --> 18:35.246
Mm, why can't it be both?

18:37.983 --> 18:40.618
'Twas the night
before Christmas

18:40.620 --> 18:42.253
and all through the park

18:42.255 --> 18:44.255
there are a bunch
of people saying

18:44.257 --> 18:46.390
"hey, Johnny,
why's that tree still dark?"

18:46.392 --> 18:48.826
- Huh?
- ( Applause )

18:48.828 --> 18:50.128
All right, folks.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.063
Well, before our big
show-stopping solo,

18:52.065 --> 18:55.066
Liv Rooney has the honor
of lighting that tree.

18:55.068 --> 18:58.302
So let's get her
out here, huh? Come on.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.371
<i>( Cheering )</i>

19:01.740 --> 19:03.841
( Chuckles, clears throat )

19:03.843 --> 19:05.243
Thank you, Johnny.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.778
Lighting this tree
is a great honor,

19:07.780 --> 19:10.114
but it is one that
I would like to pass on

19:10.116 --> 19:12.350
to the young and very talented

19:12.352 --> 19:13.784
Jenny keene.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.220
This is her moment.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.389
( Applause )

19:19.791 --> 19:22.326
Maybe all Jenny needed
was that one person

19:22.328 --> 19:23.861
to truly care about her

19:23.863 --> 19:25.263
so that she could blossom

19:25.265 --> 19:27.198
into the greatest
version of herself.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.369
Get off my stage, blondie.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.104
( Giggles )

19:34.039 --> 19:35.773
Okay. Maybe not.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.344
Merry Christmas, Stevens point.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.148
( Cheering, exclaims )

19:44.150 --> 19:46.250
( Grunts ) Yes!

19:46.252 --> 19:47.451
Ha ha.

19:53.058 --> 19:55.927
Uh, dad, is that supposed
to be smoking like that?

20:04.136 --> 20:06.270
Well, it looks like
little Jenny keene

20:06.272 --> 20:08.239
just ruined Christmas.

20:09.274 --> 20:12.843
Christmas tree down.
Christmas tree down!

20:14.313 --> 20:17.815
Liv Rooney, you set me up!

20:17.817 --> 20:20.218
She ruined my big moment.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.921
I hate this town,
and everyone in it!

20:26.258 --> 20:29.260
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

20:29.262 --> 20:32.263
was little Jenny keene's
impression

20:32.265 --> 20:34.131
of ebenezer scrooge.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.267
Yay, Jenny.
( Chuckles )

20:36.269 --> 20:38.736
Oh, what a talented
little actress,

20:38.738 --> 20:40.805
am I right?

20:40.807 --> 20:44.175
So that's probably it
for the show.

20:45.877 --> 20:48.946
Merry Christmas?

20:52.050 --> 20:54.485
Oh. Wow.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.787
She really is a monster.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.490
Yeah, I told you, mom.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.325
She is way worse than I was.

21:01.327 --> 21:04.528
It's Christmas, sweetie.
Sure.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.266
Well, I guess the show's over.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.067
It's a bummer.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.269
Oh, I know, honey.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.337
I was... I was really
looking forward

21:13.339 --> 21:14.438
to your big solo.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.141
Don't give up yet.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.477
I think dad and I may
have actually found a way

21:19.479 --> 21:21.545
to save Christmas.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.282
Get ready for
"Christmas unplugged."

21:24.284 --> 21:25.549
( Squeals )

21:25.551 --> 21:28.286
And Liv gets to sing
"let it snow."

21:28.288 --> 21:31.489
That is the only song
you'll be singing, right?

21:34.159 --> 21:37.061
( Guitar playing )

21:37.063 --> 21:40.164
¶ Oh, the weather outside
is frightful ¶

21:40.166 --> 21:43.401
¶ but the fire
is so delightful ¶

21:43.403 --> 21:47.305
¶ and since we've
no place to go ¶

21:47.307 --> 21:49.006
¶ let it snow, let it snow ¶

21:49.008 --> 21:50.808
¶ let it snow

21:50.810 --> 21:52.810
( flute plying )

21:52.812 --> 21:55.813
¶ Oh, it doesn't show
signs of stopping ¶

21:55.815 --> 21:59.817
¶ and I've bought
some corn for popping ¶

21:59.819 --> 22:03.154
¶ the lights are
turned way down low ¶

22:03.156 --> 22:04.822
¶ let it snow, let it snow ¶

22:04.824 --> 22:06.524
¶ let it snow...

22:07.959 --> 22:09.160
Even though it didn't snow,

22:09.162 --> 22:10.594
it's kind of the perfect
Christmas Eve, huh?

22:10.596 --> 22:13.197
Yeah, except I already
broke my helicopter.

22:14.299 --> 22:15.866
Well, at least
you have a backup.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.401
Nope.
Broke that one too.

22:19.304 --> 22:22.473
¶ All the way home
I'll be warm ¶

22:22.475 --> 22:25.276
¶ the fire is slowly dying ¶

22:25.278 --> 22:28.946
¶ and my dear,
we're still goodbye-ing ¶

22:28.948 --> 22:32.350
<i>¶ but as long as</i>
<i>you love me so ¶</i>

22:32.352 --> 22:34.151
¶ let it snow, let it snow ¶

22:34.153 --> 22:35.986
¶ let it snow.

22:39.324 --> 22:41.559
( Cheering )

22:43.228 --> 22:45.396
All right, Liv.
Good night, everybody.

22:45.398 --> 22:48.299
I know it didn't snow, but at
least it didn't rain, right?

22:48.301 --> 22:50.167
<i>( Thunder crashes )</i>

22:50.169 --> 22:51.902
( All groan )

22:53.305 --> 22:54.905
Are you kidding me?

23:03.582 --> 23:05.316
Uh, Parker,

23:05.318 --> 23:07.284
dad, come quick
before it stops.

23:07.286 --> 23:09.620
- What is it, son?
- Is it snowing on Christmas?

23:09.622 --> 23:10.955
Better.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.961
( Laughs )

23:24.302 --> 23:26.170
I got her those for Christmas.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.306
Oh, thank you, father.
