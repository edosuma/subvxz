01:26.417 --> 01:30.209
I wanted to get there tomorrow night.
- That wasn't going to happen.

01:30.209 --> 01:32.417
We couldn't have known about customs.

01:32.417 --> 01:35.167
It'd be a miracle
if they didn't question something.

01:40.876 --> 01:41.917
Food's here.

01:43.917 --> 01:45.167
Great.

01:46.876 --> 01:48.917
I've lost my appetite.

01:50.584 --> 01:52.209
Guys, come get your keys.

01:52.209 --> 01:54.876
Keys?
- First come, first served.

01:56.376 --> 01:59.792
What are you doing here?
Where are you going?

01:59.792 --> 02:01.376
Bulgaria.

02:01.376 --> 02:03.459
How come?
- Work.

02:04.376 --> 02:07.001
Work? You can work in Germany.

02:09.001 --> 02:13.251
How many cards?
I can say what I need, right?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.209
17 and four.

02:16.084 --> 02:18.126
I'm dead anyway!

02:31.167 --> 02:34.584
Shit, the whole road's blocked.
It's all over the ground.

02:37.876 --> 02:40.084
Great, more extra work.

02:42.959 --> 02:45.376
More trees up there, Vincent?

02:46.709 --> 02:47.959
Boris?

02:48.459 --> 02:50.876
Come on. We've got other stuff to do.

02:52.959 --> 02:55.709
This'll set us back again.
- Oh, well.

03:44.376 --> 03:45.751
Hey, newbie.

03:47.876 --> 03:50.292
Just getting the guys a drink.

03:51.292 --> 03:53.876
You got skills or not?

03:54.959 --> 03:56.792
What do you need?

03:56.792 --> 03:58.751
Show me what you've got.

04:15.917 --> 04:17.375
Alright.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.000
You been away on a job before?

04:23.251 --> 04:24.917
Not abroad.

04:25.376 --> 04:27.292
You a wise guy?

04:33.876 --> 04:35.959
I'm here to earn money.

04:48.167 --> 04:51.876
Here you go. Everyone helps themselves.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.917
Just serve it.

04:54.917 --> 04:57.501
Who washed the dishes?
- Good question.

04:58.084 --> 04:59.876
Who washed these?

05:02.376 --> 05:03.584
Boris.

05:03.876 --> 05:06.876
Can our Russian give us a lesson?
- You're our translator.

05:06.876 --> 05:08.209
Boris!

05:08.209 --> 05:09.667
What?

05:09.667 --> 05:11.959
If I want to talk to a girl.

05:12.209 --> 05:14.292
A girl?
- Right, exactly.

05:14.584 --> 05:17.001
How so?
- Don't lick it.

05:17.001 --> 05:19.501
How do I say "Hi" to her nicely?

05:19.751 --> 05:23.709
How would you... I can translate...

05:23.709 --> 05:26.917
Just a nice "hello."
- Then you say nicely,

05:26.917 --> 05:28.209
"Hello."

05:29.251 --> 05:32.084
Can't talk to a woman like that.

05:32.876 --> 05:35.084
Who knows when I'll get to the village?

05:35.501 --> 05:38.376
I thought Sunday was our swim day.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.667
Pass the ashtray, I want a smoke.

05:41.667 --> 05:45.459
I'd love to go shooting here.
- With a bow and arrow?

05:46.001 --> 05:47.376
No, for real.

05:49.209 --> 05:51.584
With a G36 or something.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.251
I bet they've got one in the village.

05:54.251 --> 05:56.459
What would you shoot at?

05:57.876 --> 06:01.626
What is there left to shoot up in Bulgaria?
Everything's already busted.

06:03.001 --> 06:05.501
This isn't the Foreign Legion.

06:06.209 --> 06:09.251
They wouldn't let you in anyway.
- And they'd let you in?

06:09.584 --> 06:11.709
It's not for weaklings.

06:13.209 --> 06:16.751
It's sink or swim.
- And you'd be in Africa now.

06:16.751 --> 06:21.292
War is war, life is life.
You can't just lump them together.

06:25.751 --> 06:27.376
Brief overview.

06:27.917 --> 06:30.001
The fish ladder's going there.

06:31.001 --> 06:32.792
The sluices go here.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.126
It's all marked out. Turbines there.

06:37.792 --> 06:41.667
Problem is, the river's in the wrong place.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.501
We'll do some leveling.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.376
We'll extend the natural embankment.

06:48.376 --> 06:50.084
And the road?
- Right.

06:50.084 --> 06:53.626
That'll happen when the water's gone.
- I have to get my equipment in here.

06:54.626 --> 06:58.084
You want that river gone?
- Yeah, so we can bring it around here.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.917
We have to block it up there.

07:03.209 --> 07:06.376
What materials should we use?
- Anything here.

07:09.251 --> 07:10.917
Put your cigarette out.

07:48.584 --> 07:51.126
On your marks, get set, mount!

07:58.084 --> 08:00.876
I thought this could be the flagpole.

08:02.001 --> 08:04.084
If we lengthen it.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.751
Know what I mean?

08:10.084 --> 08:11.709
Which corner?

08:11.709 --> 08:16.584
The inside would be best.
If it's outside, it might tip over.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.417
It has to go on the outside.

08:23.876 --> 08:25.959
I don't believe it.
- What?

08:26.376 --> 08:29.751
Have you gone totally nuts?
- Yeah, we have.

08:30.084 --> 08:32.292
Or else we wouldn't be here, right?

08:34.708 --> 08:37.126
Have you considered the locals?

08:37.126 --> 08:39.083
We do nothing else.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.583
We're building them a water power plant.

08:47.626 --> 08:49.376
Looks awesome.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.667
Muggy, right?

09:00.376 --> 09:02.292
The heat kills you.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.376
My jam will make you guys lick the jar clean.

09:17.251 --> 09:19.209
What's going on here?

09:20.292 --> 09:21.876
What are you doing?

09:27.001 --> 09:28.876
Are you from up there?

09:35.917 --> 09:37.292
I don't understand you.

09:37.917 --> 09:40.501
I bet he's one of the Germans.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.959
This land...
- Jens?

09:45.667 --> 09:46.792
Put the knife away.

09:47.126 --> 09:48.709
...is Georgi's.
- Put it away.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.417
Don't you know this is Georgi's land?
The nut trees...

09:56.876 --> 09:58.417
the plums...

10:00.001 --> 10:03.584
I don't understand you guys!
- What are you doing here?

10:10.292 --> 10:11.876
Man, oh man...

10:16.751 --> 10:19.084
They were after something.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.876
Like scouts, you know? Really!

10:21.876 --> 10:24.751
Checking things out, seeing who we are...

10:24.751 --> 10:28.292
I didn't understand them. Sorry.

10:28.292 --> 10:32.501
They weren't necessarily hostile,
but we should watch out.

11:03.376 --> 11:05.876
Marcel! We're going this way!

11:27.292 --> 11:29.792
Why can't you listen?

11:30.501 --> 11:31.917
I said this way!

11:34.584 --> 11:37.167
Dumbass, get that thing out of there!

11:44.084 --> 11:45.251
Sorry.

11:45.251 --> 11:46.876
This sucks.

11:59.209 --> 12:02.417
Jens, what's up?
Can you bring us a few beers?

12:03.376 --> 12:06.001
You're getting on my nerves.

12:06.626 --> 12:09.626
Know what I'm doing?
- Bringing me a beer?

12:09.876 --> 12:12.417
Going for a swim.
- You forgot something.

12:12.709 --> 12:14.626
I don't think so.

12:14.626 --> 12:16.876
Meinhard, throw me a beer!

12:19.667 --> 12:21.167
Can you do it?

12:24.959 --> 12:28.667
Just what I wanted to see! You deserve it!

12:28.667 --> 12:30.251
You shouldn't have moved.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.917
Freshened up now?

12:34.917 --> 12:39.084
Tommy, you should've kept drifting.
I would've fished you out at the site.

12:40.376 --> 12:42.251
Look, a Fata Morgana.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.751
Where did they come from?

13:02.917 --> 13:05.626
Take it off!
- Nice and slow!

13:06.209 --> 13:07.584
Real slow.

13:09.251 --> 13:10.251
Look at that.

13:14.501 --> 13:15.959
Hot stuff.

13:17.459 --> 13:19.376
Here's your beer.

13:26.626 --> 13:27.917
Tommy, watch this.

13:30.501 --> 13:32.126
Vincent, get it!

13:37.001 --> 13:38.126
Go for it!

13:40.959 --> 13:42.917
We've got the hat, at least.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.251
Thanks.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.292
My lady.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.126
Come and get it.

14:02.251 --> 14:03.917
Can I have my hat back?

14:09.709 --> 14:11.584
What do you want?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.584
Give her the hat.

14:14.376 --> 14:16.376
What is this? Come here.

14:16.376 --> 14:17.876
Give her the hat.

14:19.084 --> 14:20.959
Come on, give me my hat!

14:20.959 --> 14:22.792
You're right. Come and get it.

14:28.376 --> 14:30.292
Viara, be careful!

14:30.584 --> 14:32.251
Look at that.

14:35.376 --> 14:37.584
Sonofabitch, give me my hat.

14:37.584 --> 14:39.084
You pig!

14:42.584 --> 14:45.501
Quit jerking her around and give her the hat.

14:45.501 --> 14:46.917
Yes, Mom.

14:50.209 --> 14:52.417
Enough. Give me my hat.

14:57.209 --> 14:59.084
No! Viara! No!

15:04.751 --> 15:06.751
Vincent, what are you doing?

15:07.876 --> 15:08.751
Idiot!

15:29.251 --> 15:30.709
Come back!

15:35.167 --> 15:37.126
Sure, you're all smarter.

15:38.584 --> 15:41.001
You went a bit too far, huh?

15:54.501 --> 15:56.876
Isn't the heat driving you crazy?

15:56.876 --> 15:58.376
Not yet.
- Get a hat.

15:59.084 --> 16:02.001
I've got one down below.
- I'm heading up.

16:10.001 --> 16:11.584
Lunch!

16:20.167 --> 16:22.667
Get the machine out of the sun.
- Alright.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.584
I want to go that way, not that way.

17:29.001 --> 17:30.959
You can't beat me.

19:23.251 --> 19:24.876
They're mine.

19:25.376 --> 19:27.417
I've got...
- What?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.251
No, no.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.709
You. Cigarette?

19:45.376 --> 19:46.626
I don't have any.

19:48.792 --> 19:50.959
Where are you from?

19:58.459 --> 19:59.709
Meinhard.

20:00.751 --> 20:03.251
Where's this guy from? You know him?

20:03.251 --> 20:05.084
We're getting acquainted.

20:07.417 --> 20:09.001
I just asked for a cigarette.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.292
Germany.

20:13.167 --> 20:15.292
Sophisticated people, educated!

20:15.626 --> 20:17.417
Bravo, you two.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.751
Having a nice chat with the German.

20:19.751 --> 20:23.876
We're telling the guy...
- After I refused him a cigarette.

20:23.876 --> 20:27.459
I'm telling him there used to be Germans here.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.376
There used to be, but...

20:29.751 --> 20:31.917
They're civilized, decent.

20:31.917 --> 20:34.876
He's clearly not one of the decent ones.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.626
Come on, give the man a cigarette.

20:40.001 --> 20:43.084
During the war, they were orderly and neat.

20:43.084 --> 20:46.001
And honest! Always honest and upright...

20:46.959 --> 20:48.626
Cigarette.

20:48.626 --> 20:50.501
One. No more.
- Thank you.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.167
Because of them. Otherwise you'd get nothing.

20:54.126 --> 20:57.376
It won't happen again. Let him have a smoke.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.292
The Germans...

21:00.292 --> 21:04.084
put homemade lamps
on the backs of donkeys

21:05.001 --> 21:08.584
lit them and sent the donkeys along the border

21:08.584 --> 21:10.584
between Bulgaria and Greece.

21:11.917 --> 21:14.876
The Greeks aimed their rifles.

21:17.251 --> 21:19.417
The donkey walked on.

21:21.126 --> 21:23.584
The Germans came from behind.

21:24.292 --> 21:26.917
And attacked. Bang, bang, bang. Finished.

21:28.292 --> 21:29.501
Horse.

21:30.667 --> 21:32.667
The horse is Adrian's.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.084
Where living?

21:52.126 --> 21:53.709
What does he want?

21:54.084 --> 21:55.917
He says it's his horse.

21:56.876 --> 21:59.584
It's your uncle's.
- What's up?

22:05.084 --> 22:07.209
Vanko, let's take the horse and go.

22:18.001 --> 22:19.167
Get down.

22:20.584 --> 22:23.001
Vanko, let's take it and go.

22:28.084 --> 22:31.667
Why are you giving it to him?
- Maybe he spoke to my uncle.

22:38.126 --> 22:41.376
Get the horse.
- What do you want me to do?

22:54.917 --> 22:57.792
Nice.
- Maybe as a cutlet, yeah.

22:58.584 --> 23:00.251
Where did you get him?

23:01.501 --> 23:03.792
Unbelievable, dude!

23:09.167 --> 23:11.667
Don't you think someone's looking for it?

23:11.667 --> 23:13.292
It's a beast, right?

23:41.876 --> 23:44.167
I used to braid my sister's hair.

23:45.417 --> 23:46.876
Like...

23:50.084 --> 23:52.501
Want us to leave you guys alone?

23:53.167 --> 23:55.626
Is it ladies' night or something?

23:57.376 --> 23:59.209
Come on, don't be like that.

23:59.459 --> 24:01.501
We know you have a dick.

24:02.792 --> 24:03.876
Helga?

24:04.459 --> 24:05.876
Hey, it's Helmut.

24:07.584 --> 24:09.959
I'll use the rubber band from the fish bag.

24:09.959 --> 24:13.084
What? You washed your hands, right?
- Yes.

24:13.084 --> 24:16.584
I wouldn't forget your birthday. You know me.

24:17.167 --> 24:20.084
Do you use conditioner and all?
- The whole works.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.209
Helga?

24:21.209 --> 24:23.084
It gets real soft.
- I know.

24:23.084 --> 24:24.917
I'd love hair like that.

24:28.126 --> 24:30.292
Quit fidgeting!
- Alright.

24:32.167 --> 24:35.417
We got cut off in the middle of the call.

24:35.792 --> 24:38.876
I'll try again tomorrow.
- A "snap!"

24:41.709 --> 24:43.459
He heard something.

24:44.667 --> 24:46.667
Something snapped again.

24:47.376 --> 24:50.584
They see us, but we can't see them.

24:51.084 --> 24:55.167
Two options:
Either we make lots of noise or we creep up.

24:55.417 --> 24:57.626
Someone coming with me?
- Yeah.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.209
One's enough.

25:06.001 --> 25:08.376
Two guys, up there!

25:10.792 --> 25:12.209
They're running away!

25:27.251 --> 25:28.959
The lights are gone, huh?

25:52.376 --> 25:54.626
Look at that: civilization.

25:55.459 --> 25:57.417
There are guys over there.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.667
Party central.

26:05.001 --> 26:06.709
There's another one.

26:10.584 --> 26:12.167
Signs of life.

26:21.792 --> 26:24.584
Let's go back to the square.
- To take another look.

26:29.001 --> 26:31.626
These villages are like time travel, right?

26:32.084 --> 26:33.876
Going back in time.

26:38.292 --> 26:39.376
More villagers.

26:50.501 --> 26:52.459
Now they know we're here.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.001
We're back!

26:55.251 --> 26:56.917
Only took 70 years...

27:17.584 --> 27:19.876
Man, what kind of place is this?

27:26.292 --> 27:28.001
What's this?

27:29.084 --> 27:32.001
Doesn't look like a bunker or a cowshed.

27:48.376 --> 27:49.876
Come on.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.792
Pedal to the metal!

29:14.459 --> 29:15.917
You mean Krassi?

29:16.251 --> 29:17.792
Yeah, call him.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.584
Give it here.

29:22.959 --> 29:26.292
Hi, Krassi. Sorry to call so late.

29:27.209 --> 29:29.126
It's important, brother.

29:31.084 --> 29:33.251
You can't say "No."

29:35.084 --> 29:38.376
We have to do it tonight.
Tomorrow is too late.

29:42.126 --> 29:43.126
Buddy, listen...

29:44.084 --> 29:45.709
Isn't the camp...?

29:45.709 --> 29:48.459
You're about to meet a German. A hitch-hiker.

29:48.959 --> 29:50.876
Says he's from the camp.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.292
Germany?

29:52.292 --> 29:55.209
I thought he was fleeing across the border!

29:58.917 --> 30:00.376
We're coming over.

30:01.209 --> 30:03.209
Greece is right there.

30:04.167 --> 30:05.376
Greece.

30:06.876 --> 30:09.917
That's the border. Aren't you scared?

30:10.876 --> 30:13.376
There are refugees.
- No understand.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.167
Machine guns.

30:16.792 --> 30:18.459
Soldiers, soldiers!

30:25.667 --> 30:27.917
Me too... soldier.

30:29.959 --> 30:31.209
Me, soldier.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.876
You?
- Me, soldier.

30:37.626 --> 30:38.876
Légionnaire.

30:43.917 --> 30:45.876
- Légionnaire?
- Légionnaire.

30:49.376 --> 30:50.709
Afghanistan.

30:51.709 --> 30:53.084
Africa.

30:53.626 --> 30:54.501
Killer?

30:55.209 --> 30:56.667
You a killer?

31:00.126 --> 31:01.751
Have you killed anyone?

31:03.584 --> 31:04.876
Anyone?

31:10.501 --> 31:13.584
They forbade him to talk about it.

31:14.584 --> 31:15.917
Of course.

31:23.084 --> 31:24.584
Krassi, what's up?

31:24.584 --> 31:26.084
What's up.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.876
I'm worried.

31:36.876 --> 31:38.501
Let's go.

31:38.501 --> 31:40.001
We're going.

31:40.459 --> 31:42.209
Where did you find him?

31:48.084 --> 31:49.376
France?

31:49.376 --> 31:50.667
Légion.

31:57.417 --> 31:58.751
Impossible...

32:20.626 --> 32:22.584
The flag's gone.

32:24.959 --> 32:27.084
That's not funny.

32:27.417 --> 32:30.626
What?
- Did you take the flag down or what?

32:30.626 --> 32:33.209
Very funny. Are you messing with us?

32:33.209 --> 32:34.876
No way.

32:35.584 --> 32:37.709
Someone must've been here.

32:42.459 --> 32:45.376
So how did you get back here so quickly?

32:46.417 --> 32:49.209
My inner compass told me the way.

35:31.376 --> 35:33.376
He's the guy we picked up.

35:33.376 --> 35:35.167
Me speak German.

35:37.584 --> 35:39.709
You knowing girl

35:41.584 --> 35:43.292
from our village?

35:44.501 --> 35:46.626
What you doing with this girl?

35:47.292 --> 35:48.709
Flirt or what?
- Me?

35:48.959 --> 35:50.084
You.

35:50.376 --> 35:52.584
Viara was in the river.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.584
Her hat fell off.

35:54.584 --> 35:56.751
You also in there?

35:58.584 --> 35:59.709
Not me.

36:00.917 --> 36:02.792
Where did you find him?

36:02.792 --> 36:04.584
A co-worker. Find out the name.

36:04.584 --> 36:08.001
That co-worker in this village:
big problem, my friend.

36:08.459 --> 36:09.959
Understanding?

36:11.167 --> 36:12.584
Alright, guys?

36:13.876 --> 36:15.084
Alright?

36:18.417 --> 36:20.251
You wanted to see me.

36:20.251 --> 36:22.001
I'm Adrian.

36:22.001 --> 36:23.501
And you?

36:30.751 --> 36:32.751
You like the horse?

36:33.084 --> 36:34.417
Horse?

36:40.459 --> 36:42.459
Nice stones. Where'd you get them?

36:56.501 --> 36:58.001
Hey, Légionnaire!

36:58.459 --> 37:01.292
Vanko on the horse, super!

37:01.667 --> 37:03.792
He'll teach you to ride.

37:04.084 --> 37:06.501
You, jockey. Learn from professional.

37:36.459 --> 37:37.876
Hi, guys.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.917
I'm a bit late.

37:54.126 --> 37:55.417
Well?

37:56.167 --> 37:58.126
Were you on guard duty?

38:02.376 --> 38:04.459
Everything OK with the equipment?

38:05.126 --> 38:06.626
Perfect.

38:07.084 --> 38:08.709
No one was there, right?

38:09.459 --> 38:12.084
Who would've been there?
- Well...

38:12.667 --> 38:15.626
we don't do it for nothing. Oh, well.

38:15.876 --> 38:18.209
Have a good night.
- You, too.

38:18.209 --> 38:20.417
See you tomorrow.
- Sweet dreams.

38:39.376 --> 38:42.084
I need to sleep, too. Early start.

38:42.084 --> 38:43.376
Good night.

38:43.751 --> 38:45.084
Night.

38:48.376 --> 38:50.584
We need at least six truckloads.

38:50.584 --> 38:52.667
Guys, can I get some help?

38:53.292 --> 38:54.917
Because I say so.

38:55.376 --> 38:56.876
We're busy!

39:02.626 --> 39:07.084
Can't you manage a little dish washing?
- Call that a little?

39:40.376 --> 39:43.209
But that's not how it is, Jürgen.

39:44.167 --> 39:46.584
Are you here or am I?

39:46.584 --> 39:49.376
This isn't what we signed up for.

39:51.584 --> 39:53.876
I don't know what to do with the guys.

39:54.376 --> 39:56.417
We don't even have drinking water.

39:58.667 --> 40:01.167
I know we're behind.

40:02.084 --> 40:03.667
Let's do that.

40:04.001 --> 40:05.792
OK, talk soon.

40:25.084 --> 40:26.501
Hey, it's me.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.667
It's not going so well.

40:38.501 --> 40:40.876
Honey, we talked about this.

40:43.959 --> 40:45.792
Your own apartment?

40:46.501 --> 40:48.417
You found another guy or what?

40:56.584 --> 40:57.876
Sonja...

40:58.626 --> 41:01.084
Let's try one more time.

41:04.126 --> 41:06.084
I'll be back.

41:24.084 --> 41:25.251
Understand?

41:27.626 --> 41:28.917
Let's see.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.376
To the left!

41:52.001 --> 41:53.126
Woah.

42:01.459 --> 42:02.876
You're a Légionnaire?

42:03.792 --> 42:06.376
Trick. Show me a trick.

42:22.376 --> 42:23.751
Your legs.

42:28.876 --> 42:32.667
Every stone has its place, OK? Go on.

42:33.376 --> 42:35.501
Like he understands you!

42:35.501 --> 42:37.626
Give him a smaller stone.

42:41.959 --> 42:44.876
You put them down and I'll choose them.

42:47.001 --> 42:48.459
Smaller.

42:50.209 --> 42:52.584
A memento of your time here.

42:53.667 --> 42:55.084
Face.

42:55.876 --> 42:57.209
Take it.

43:00.584 --> 43:01.751
Face.

43:02.167 --> 43:05.376
Face! Gulzet face, Meinhard face.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.667
Adrian face.
- Face.

43:08.001 --> 43:10.417
The stone, also face.
- Well.

43:13.084 --> 43:14.917
Water.
- To drink.

43:15.917 --> 43:17.876
"Voda."
- "Voda," yes.

43:26.667 --> 43:27.959
Hit it hard.

43:28.751 --> 43:30.792
Don't be gentle. It can't feel.

43:35.459 --> 43:36.626
Muscles.

43:36.876 --> 43:39.126
Why here "voda,"

43:41.001 --> 43:42.459
but not in camp?

43:43.084 --> 43:46.584
There's no water in the camp? The system.

43:49.876 --> 43:52.751
It alternates.
- Water. For tobacco.

43:53.251 --> 43:56.001
The tobacco's being harvested.
- Ah, tobacco.

43:56.251 --> 43:57.501
Meinhard!

43:57.876 --> 43:59.584
Cigarette? Break?

43:59.584 --> 44:01.584
First work, then fun.

44:01.584 --> 44:04.126
First work. Germans only working.

44:04.626 --> 44:08.501
Want a break?
- You taught him well.

44:13.001 --> 44:14.917
Where is your co-workers?

44:15.751 --> 44:17.709
Camp
- Camp?

44:18.126 --> 44:20.876
Doing what? Sleeping? Work done?

44:20.876 --> 44:21.917
And...

44:23.459 --> 44:24.917
cellphone and...

44:26.876 --> 44:28.917
enjoying the sun.
- Freedom.

44:32.709 --> 44:35.084
Another question: What do you call a truck?

44:35.876 --> 44:37.209
Truck, yeah?

44:37.209 --> 44:38.501
A 40-ton truck.

44:38.501 --> 44:39.751
How much?
- 40 tons.

44:40.292 --> 44:41.584
40 tons?

44:41.584 --> 44:44.251
Water?
- You need 40 tons or...?

44:44.251 --> 44:46.709
No, we ordered. Gravel.

44:47.084 --> 44:51.292
They ordered 40 tons of gravel.
- Gravel! Small stones.

44:51.292 --> 44:54.376
But it hasn't arrived.
- Why?

44:54.917 --> 44:59.126
Adrian, where can you get gravel?
- I only have big stones.

44:59.376 --> 45:03.209
Adrian knows everything.
- Tell him about the quarries.

45:03.209 --> 45:05.626
Adrian knows more...
- No gravel here.

45:06.167 --> 45:07.792
On the road,

45:08.167 --> 45:09.959
five kilometers away,

45:10.584 --> 45:13.167
is his quarry.

45:19.751 --> 45:21.084
Wait for me.

45:21.959 --> 45:23.501
I'll be right back.

45:31.876 --> 45:33.626
Look after him!

46:07.251 --> 46:09.126
Do you have a napkin?

46:09.126 --> 46:12.001
Shall I bring you one,
or will you get them yourself?

46:25.876 --> 46:27.251
Like that.

46:31.626 --> 46:32.876
Stick.

46:34.417 --> 46:36.167
Stick.
- Stick.

46:37.084 --> 46:38.209
Stick.

47:23.084 --> 47:24.209
Veneta?

47:25.876 --> 47:28.084
Ask if he likes it spicy.

47:28.084 --> 47:30.167
If he likes what?
- Spicy peppers.

47:30.167 --> 47:31.209
How should I?

47:32.501 --> 47:34.959
"In the salad, do you like spicy peppers?"

47:36.292 --> 47:37.626
Spicy peppers?

47:42.292 --> 47:44.751
He doesn't.
- But I've chopped them already.

47:58.084 --> 48:00.084
Adrian's coming back.

48:00.084 --> 48:01.584
With everyone else.

48:02.001 --> 48:03.876
We'd better finish up.

48:29.876 --> 48:31.084
This Russia?

48:31.876 --> 48:33.917
Russian?
- Russian.

48:33.917 --> 48:35.126
"Rusko!"

48:35.126 --> 48:38.001
Remnants of communism.
- Good truck.

48:38.376 --> 48:39.709
Good quality.

48:40.084 --> 48:41.751
Super!
- Good motor.

48:41.751 --> 48:43.167
Super modern.

48:50.376 --> 48:51.709
Paradise.

48:57.917 --> 48:59.917
We'll understand each other.

49:03.959 --> 49:05.292
That's the valve.

49:05.292 --> 49:06.667
For the water.

49:08.417 --> 49:10.001
Left. Right.

49:10.584 --> 49:13.459
Adrian has water. Meinhard, no water.

49:13.459 --> 49:16.126
Meinhard has water. Adrian, no water.

49:16.126 --> 49:17.376
Valve.

49:17.709 --> 49:19.292
Ah, lever.

49:46.667 --> 49:48.584
Face.
- Face.

49:54.459 --> 49:55.584
Surprise.

50:07.459 --> 50:08.917
There's energy up there.

50:09.584 --> 50:11.292
For fighting.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.959
Up there, on the head.

50:14.792 --> 50:16.292
On the face.

50:35.709 --> 50:37.126
Wait for me here.

50:38.751 --> 50:40.126
Some business.

51:01.376 --> 51:04.126
Forget it.
- There are no friends in business.

51:07.876 --> 51:09.417
Where did he come from?

51:09.417 --> 51:10.876
Germany.

51:12.376 --> 51:13.709
Bodyguard.

51:16.667 --> 51:19.501
A German bodyguard falls from the sky.

51:21.251 --> 51:22.876
Come on, go.

51:24.667 --> 51:25.501
Go.

51:28.376 --> 51:29.584
Come on.

51:51.459 --> 51:55.751
I'd have thought the caretaker could fix it,
but it's just not happening.

51:56.084 --> 51:59.167
If this goes on, our work will be a disaster.

51:59.167 --> 52:00.709
Fantastic.

52:02.584 --> 52:04.376
Look who it is.

52:07.584 --> 52:09.001
Cheers.

52:09.001 --> 52:12.584
Where'd you get that?
- Greetings from the village.

52:12.584 --> 52:16.959
You been making liquor all day?
- Which barn did you find it in?

52:19.167 --> 52:20.417
Moonshine.

52:20.792 --> 52:23.001
Come on, serve the hooch.

52:23.584 --> 52:24.959
What is it?

52:27.001 --> 52:28.959
What's it called?
- Rakia.

52:28.959 --> 52:31.084
Rakia? Raki or what?

52:31.667 --> 52:34.917
Have you tried it? Can you gargle with it?

52:34.917 --> 52:36.376
Here's to your village!

52:40.417 --> 52:42.751
What's the village like? They got water?

52:43.501 --> 52:46.251
Water? What for? We have raki.

52:46.251 --> 52:48.959
But we can't use rakia to mix concrete.

52:52.084 --> 52:53.792
There's not enough water.

52:54.751 --> 52:57.584
It's shared between three villages.

52:57.876 --> 53:01.584
There's a lever and the water gets rationed.

53:02.209 --> 53:03.876
What kind of lever?

53:06.376 --> 53:08.209
Want to steal the water?

53:08.584 --> 53:09.584
If we have to.

53:10.751 --> 53:12.459
I wouldn't call it "stealing."

53:13.292 --> 53:16.959
If my site needs water,
I'll make sure we get it.

53:16.959 --> 53:19.084
They can't wait to meet you.

53:20.084 --> 53:22.292
Good to know. I'll have to visit them.

53:23.376 --> 53:25.251
Just show me the way.

53:25.251 --> 53:27.709
On the way back, show me the lever.

53:27.709 --> 53:29.376
Don't forget the flag.

53:30.417 --> 53:33.084
How much do you want to steal? A ton?

53:33.792 --> 53:36.417
You can do it once, but not all the time.

53:36.417 --> 53:38.876
The problem is, there's not enough.

53:38.876 --> 53:40.584
We got that.

53:40.584 --> 53:44.292
If we offer them something...

53:44.292 --> 53:48.126
Who's in charge of distribution?
We need to contact them.

53:48.126 --> 53:50.251
Life isn't always as simple...

53:50.709 --> 53:52.667
as you think.

53:54.876 --> 53:55.876
Sit down.

54:47.084 --> 54:49.084
You're either with us or against us.

54:49.084 --> 54:50.917
Or your trip's over.

54:59.709 --> 55:01.751
Violence isn't my thing.

55:32.126 --> 55:33.501
Look at this.

55:35.001 --> 55:38.792
Fucking rude, driving right up here.
- When in Rome...

55:38.792 --> 55:40.792
They've really settled in.

55:40.792 --> 55:44.084
We could invite friends over,
have a bonfire and a barbecue...

55:45.292 --> 55:47.251
See his belt?

55:50.626 --> 55:53.709
What's the gun for?
- Business. Gravel.

55:53.709 --> 55:57.584
No idea what they want.
- If you're on business, why the gun?

55:57.876 --> 55:59.751
Is that your business?

56:01.626 --> 56:02.459
Gravel.

56:06.126 --> 56:07.626
Materials. Gravel.

56:08.209 --> 56:11.459
You want to do business with me.
- I'll get some from a friend.

56:11.459 --> 56:13.667
You need gravel, right?

56:14.001 --> 56:17.709
Why's he so happy?
- Cause he's bamboozling us.

56:17.709 --> 56:19.876
I guess the mafia screwed them.

56:20.251 --> 56:24.501
You want to sell me
the gravel I already paid for?

56:24.501 --> 56:26.626
We've got everything we need, thanks.

56:26.959 --> 56:29.959
We don't want to buy back our own materials.

56:30.251 --> 56:33.917
You don't have any gravel. Look.

56:33.917 --> 56:36.792
You have no gravel.

56:36.792 --> 56:39.584
Is he saying we need it?

56:39.584 --> 56:42.626
It's a mafia deal. Black market.

56:46.626 --> 56:48.376
You know him?

56:50.292 --> 56:51.459
Who's the boss?

56:53.876 --> 56:55.626
You or him?

56:57.376 --> 56:58.417
No!

56:58.792 --> 57:00.584
In the river, you...

57:01.792 --> 57:03.792
pushed the woman underwater.

57:04.917 --> 57:06.876
You did it and no other.

57:07.376 --> 57:09.126
I get what you're saying.

57:09.917 --> 57:14.126
But what do you want?
Do you want to do business with me or what?

57:14.584 --> 57:18.167
They're just on vacation here,
so he's not interested.

57:19.209 --> 57:21.084
It's pretty. Fresh air.

57:21.709 --> 57:23.584
Like a resort, right?

57:26.376 --> 57:28.251
He thinks it's funny,

57:28.251 --> 57:31.959
but soon you'll be crying.
Soon you'll be crying...

57:32.876 --> 57:34.001
Let's go.

57:34.001 --> 57:35.876
He'll come to me.

57:36.126 --> 57:37.876
You'll come to me.

57:37.876 --> 57:40.001
Bye, then.
- That's life.

57:42.459 --> 57:43.876
Made new friends?

57:43.876 --> 57:46.084
Today and tomorrow, I'm in the village.

57:54.459 --> 57:56.876
You been flirting, Meinhard?

57:58.376 --> 58:00.209
Who's the one dreaming of fucking?

58:01.209 --> 58:03.917
I don't know what you dream about.

59:14.626 --> 59:17.209
They're really going at it. Not bad.

59:18.459 --> 59:20.792
Want to have a go, Tommy?
- For sure.

59:26.167 --> 59:27.209
Go on, Tommy!

59:32.251 --> 59:34.709
Do you have sunflower seeds in Germany?

59:39.167 --> 59:40.751
Only flower.

59:42.292 --> 59:43.876
They're good.

59:44.376 --> 59:45.501
Bulgarian.

59:49.376 --> 59:51.084
You, you, you... Who?

59:53.417 --> 59:54.459
Well?

01:00:03.584 --> 01:00:04.917
Who's wrestling?

01:00:06.084 --> 01:00:07.459
Germany vs. Bulgaria!

01:00:12.126 --> 01:00:13.417
Too fast!

01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:15.876
That doesn't count!

01:00:19.084 --> 01:00:21.126
What's the boss up to?

01:00:24.001 --> 01:00:26.417
Hey, look behind you!

01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:27.876
Ask what he wants.

01:00:42.459 --> 01:00:45.792
All I can say is "Sorry." It just happened.

01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:55.626
Why do you do that?

01:00:57.667 --> 01:00:59.001
Oh, German?

01:01:18.001 --> 01:01:19.584
Money on the table.

01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:25.876
Friend!

01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:27.876
Where are you from? Germany?

01:01:29.209 --> 01:01:32.626
Iljo, he has money.
- We can squeeze him dry.

01:01:42.084 --> 01:01:43.626
A new player.

01:01:44.292 --> 01:01:45.876
Watch out, guys.

01:01:55.709 --> 01:01:58.292
Two lev so you can buy a coffee tomorrow.

01:01:58.709 --> 01:02:00.459
He gets two.
- Exactly.

01:02:00.459 --> 01:02:01.584
Six.

01:02:15.667 --> 01:02:16.876
Fold.

01:02:18.251 --> 01:02:20.084
That's a lot. It's getting serious.

01:02:22.917 --> 01:02:24.667
Kosta, do you have that much?

01:02:27.251 --> 01:02:28.709
All in.

01:02:36.876 --> 01:02:38.959
Don't try to keep up. He's well-paid.

01:02:39.209 --> 01:02:41.251
While you slave away.

01:02:56.084 --> 01:02:58.459
One, two, three, four. Game over!

01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:02.667
I'm done. Kosta is a terrible player.

01:04:27.376 --> 01:04:28.584
Is he OK?

01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:35.417
He must be sick. What happened to the boy?

01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:40.417
Wake up.

01:04:41.959 --> 01:04:43.084
Wait...

01:04:44.376 --> 01:04:45.917
Vanko? Come on!

01:04:47.126 --> 01:04:48.584
You OK?

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:51.001
What happened?

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:56.709
Who did it?

01:04:57.376 --> 01:05:00.876
It was a joke. He hit me.
- Sorry.

01:05:03.417 --> 01:05:04.917
Look what happened.

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:08.376
Alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:05:11.792 --> 01:05:12.917
You OK?

01:05:20.084 --> 01:05:22.876
Father and mother are not here.

01:05:24.584 --> 01:05:26.126
Because of money.

01:05:26.376 --> 01:05:30.501
Working in Greece. Here in Bulgaria, no work.

01:05:30.501 --> 01:05:32.084
In Greece, working.

01:05:32.084 --> 01:05:33.501
Mom, Dad.
- Greece.

01:05:35.209 --> 01:05:37.376
Me and my wife

01:05:38.459 --> 01:05:41.126
take care of him.

01:05:41.876 --> 01:05:46.001
If something happened, and it was your fault...

01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:47.584
But apparently it was his fault.

01:05:47.959 --> 01:05:49.001
It's all good.

01:05:55.501 --> 01:05:56.709
Aunt.

01:05:59.209 --> 01:06:00.584
His aunt.

01:06:01.126 --> 01:06:04.001
Why are you petting him? He deserved it.

01:06:04.459 --> 01:06:06.084
He has two lumps already.

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:12.292
Here they are!

01:06:17.667 --> 01:06:19.376
Paying a visit.

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:22.292
How's it going?

01:06:23.084 --> 01:06:26.251
One sport after the other:
wrestling, then drinking.

01:06:26.251 --> 01:06:28.376
I jumped onto him from the truck.

01:06:28.376 --> 01:06:31.417
From the truck?
- And straight to the ground.

01:06:35.417 --> 01:06:36.626
Not me.

01:06:38.376 --> 01:06:39.709
His fault?

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:42.876
I really didn't mean it.

01:06:43.376 --> 01:06:46.459
Bravo, Vanko.
You've seen stars for the first time.

01:06:47.167 --> 01:06:48.709
All heroes have battle scars.

01:06:49.792 --> 01:06:51.292
Cheers!

01:06:57.084 --> 01:06:59.251
He's German.

01:07:00.792 --> 01:07:03.084
He's apologizing.

01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:05.584
Because he's innocent.

01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:07.584
Bulgaria.

01:07:08.709 --> 01:07:12.376
He's fond of Bulgaria.
- He says he's fond of Bulgaria.

01:07:12.876 --> 01:07:14.584
He likes it here.

01:07:14.584 --> 01:07:16.084
Bulgaria's beautiful.

01:07:16.084 --> 01:07:18.167
But Germany's beautiful, too.

01:07:18.751 --> 01:07:21.667
You're young. You'll live a long time.

01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:26.751
You get along.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:28.251
You get along well.

01:07:28.709 --> 01:07:29.959
Family!

01:07:31.084 --> 01:07:33.501
The head of the family.
- Our mother.

01:07:34.459 --> 01:07:35.751
She's our mother.

01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:38.167
Do you have family?

01:07:39.876 --> 01:07:41.709
Do you have family?

01:07:42.126 --> 01:07:43.876
A family? A wife?

01:07:43.876 --> 01:07:46.126
Me? No.
- I have a wife.

01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:49.417
Freedom.
- Freedom.

01:07:49.417 --> 01:07:51.084
Free.
- Free.

01:07:56.959 --> 01:07:58.751
That's why he doesn't have one.

01:07:58.751 --> 01:08:00.084
My life

01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:03.001
is sometimes complicated.

01:08:06.084 --> 01:08:07.084
Now we need help.

01:08:10.709 --> 01:08:12.917
Better late than never.

01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:15.251
It's fine.

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:17.459
It happens.

01:08:18.251 --> 01:08:20.376
A drink?
- I'll have one.

01:08:27.084 --> 01:08:28.626
Cheers, everyone.

01:08:32.167 --> 01:08:33.584
Bodyguard.

01:08:34.251 --> 01:08:35.459
You good?

01:08:41.167 --> 01:08:43.167
Vanko is your friend.

01:08:43.584 --> 01:08:47.001
I have eyes. I see everything. I watch.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.751
With weapons.
- No.

01:08:51.376 --> 01:08:53.001
Knives.

01:08:53.001 --> 01:08:54.251
No.

01:08:54.251 --> 01:08:57.001
Don't put ideas in his head.

01:08:57.001 --> 01:08:59.292
Or you'll have to deal with me.

01:08:59.876 --> 01:09:01.876
There's no one else.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:03.876
I take care of him.

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:08.876
I had some money, but it's all gone.

01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:12.084
Look. I built a kind of terrace.

01:09:12.376 --> 01:09:14.209
Mind the step.

01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:16.959
I don't want you to trip over it.

01:09:18.459 --> 01:09:22.376
I can watch the street from here.

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:26.292
The neighbors pass by, we chat a bit.

01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:29.501
Kosta?
- Oh, you've made friends?

01:09:29.501 --> 01:09:31.209
Poker? Money?

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.126
Poker? Money?

01:09:38.001 --> 01:09:39.751
From here,

01:09:39.751 --> 01:09:41.876
I can see Ali Botush.

01:09:42.584 --> 01:09:45.126
Ali Botush is a big mountain.

01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:48.084
There might still be snow on top.

01:09:59.751 --> 01:10:01.084
Kids?

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:10.626
Three?

01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:13.084
America.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:14.209
England.

01:10:18.501 --> 01:10:19.501
Alone.

01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:24.084
Problem.

01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:29.626
Life gives and takes away.

01:10:29.876 --> 01:10:31.001
Freedom.

01:10:33.376 --> 01:10:34.751
Kids? No.

01:10:42.584 --> 01:10:45.001
America, England, Germany...

01:10:49.876 --> 01:10:52.001
Tell me about the planet.

01:10:52.917 --> 01:10:54.126
The planet.

01:10:57.292 --> 01:10:59.001
You've traveled far.

01:10:59.459 --> 01:11:01.084
Here and there.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:06.584
What do you think of this colorful world,
this planet?

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:10.876
You've been everywhere.

01:11:24.126 --> 01:11:25.751
The world is like a...

01:11:26.751 --> 01:11:28.126
How should I put it?

01:11:31.126 --> 01:11:32.584
Like animals.

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:39.167
Either you eat or you get eaten.

01:11:41.376 --> 01:11:43.917
The stronger one always wins.

01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:49.376
And we're strong enough for the world.

01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:54.126
You are strong. I am strong.

01:11:54.792 --> 01:11:56.126
For planet.

01:11:57.417 --> 01:11:59.251
He who's strongest...

01:12:04.417 --> 01:12:06.751
I always have family in my heart.

01:12:07.876 --> 01:12:09.459
Including my brother.

01:12:11.584 --> 01:12:13.084
My "bratt."

01:12:15.376 --> 01:12:19.167
I lost a brother.
- You're saying something sad.

01:12:22.001 --> 01:12:23.667
Is your brother gone?

01:12:24.501 --> 01:12:26.126
My brother is...

01:12:30.501 --> 01:12:32.459
Looking down from up there.

01:12:32.459 --> 01:12:34.209
I'm sorry to hear.

01:12:38.376 --> 01:12:39.751
He's here.

01:13:02.126 --> 01:13:03.667
Me, your brother.

01:13:47.167 --> 01:13:49.001
Do you have a headache?

01:13:49.001 --> 01:13:50.584
Does your head hurt?

01:14:01.167 --> 01:14:03.417
Such a beautiful sun.

01:14:03.417 --> 01:14:05.667
You should be working.

01:14:08.459 --> 01:14:09.792
Go, go.

01:14:12.084 --> 01:14:13.709
Go to work.

01:17:21.167 --> 01:17:22.917
Is it on?

01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:27.167
Ready?

01:18:16.084 --> 01:18:17.626
Look, dude.

01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:19.876
The first pepper.

01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:22.167
What a beast.

01:18:23.751 --> 01:18:26.084
Great, huh?
- Have you seen the horse?

01:18:26.084 --> 01:18:28.126
No, I haven't seen it either.

01:19:01.876 --> 01:19:03.084
Tobacco.

01:19:03.376 --> 01:19:04.626
Tobacco.

01:19:05.459 --> 01:19:06.626
Tobacco.

01:19:17.292 --> 01:19:18.792
Thread it on.

01:19:23.167 --> 01:19:24.667
To dry it.

01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:27.292
Wait, wait...

01:19:37.251 --> 01:19:39.084
It has to dry, like this...

01:19:46.376 --> 01:19:48.167
If only you understood me.

01:19:50.584 --> 01:19:52.709
I don't understand German.

01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:33.292
Later, cigarettes. Tobacco.

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:35.876
Is one of these for sale?

01:20:46.792 --> 01:20:48.876
There's nothing to keep me at home.

01:20:52.167 --> 01:20:53.751
No house.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.126
Not pay for you, but for...

01:21:22.126 --> 01:21:23.584
Wait, wait.

01:21:23.584 --> 01:21:25.126
Don't run away.

01:21:25.417 --> 01:21:26.876
Smile.

01:21:26.876 --> 01:21:29.084
Laugh, sweetie. That's it.

01:21:31.251 --> 01:21:32.292
Are you retarded?

01:21:32.959 --> 01:21:34.417
What was that?

01:21:34.417 --> 01:21:36.709
Explain yourself or I'll smack you.

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:40.084
What's up? Want it right now?

01:21:40.084 --> 01:21:41.376
Get lost.

01:21:42.292 --> 01:21:44.292
I'd watch out.

01:21:48.167 --> 01:21:50.667
So who turned it off?
- The water?

01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:52.501
Boris, can you translate?

01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:54.751
I'm asking who turned off the water.

01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:59.709
He's saying
someone turned off the water yesterday.

01:21:59.959 --> 01:22:02.167
There's no water in the village.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.626
Did you do that?

01:22:04.626 --> 01:22:06.751
I caused the problem, yes.

01:22:06.751 --> 01:22:08.209
He did it.

01:22:08.876 --> 01:22:11.292
To solve my own problem.

01:22:11.292 --> 01:22:13.792
Apologize and don't do it again.

01:22:14.167 --> 01:22:16.501
He's very, very angry.

01:22:16.501 --> 01:22:19.584
You can't just turn off the water.

01:22:19.584 --> 01:22:22.376
We have to show some respect.
- Boris...

01:22:23.667 --> 01:22:26.709
We're here to achieve things.
- I know, but...

01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:28.792
We're building infrastructure.

01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:33.001
We're helping them.
- But not with force.

01:22:39.501 --> 01:22:42.626
Sit down.
- Violeta, find another chair.

01:22:47.084 --> 01:22:48.251
My friend.

01:22:48.584 --> 01:22:49.917
Your favorite guy.

01:22:51.917 --> 01:22:53.084
You'll remember him.

01:22:53.959 --> 01:22:56.251
He's insisting that you translate.

01:22:57.459 --> 01:22:59.084
You'll see when you get here.

01:23:00.001 --> 01:23:01.501
We'll wait.

01:23:01.501 --> 01:23:03.084
What's this about?

01:23:03.501 --> 01:23:06.501
We're trying to fix
the water problem at the site.

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:10.959
If they only use our gray water,

01:23:11.584 --> 01:23:14.084
it could be a good thing for us.

01:23:21.876 --> 01:23:23.376
Hi, Viara.
- Hi.

01:23:29.917 --> 01:23:31.417
My daughter.

01:23:31.417 --> 01:23:33.251
That's his daughter.

01:23:33.667 --> 01:23:37.084
Her Bulgarian is better than mine, anyway.

01:23:38.751 --> 01:23:40.709
Bye.
- Bye.

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:43.209
What's going on?

01:23:44.001 --> 01:23:45.917
You have to translate.

01:23:45.917 --> 01:23:47.792
OK. What?

01:23:49.084 --> 01:23:52.709
Viara, we have a solution for the village.

01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:54.584
They can solve the problem.

01:23:55.501 --> 01:24:00.126
We'll deepen the well
and install a bigger, longer pipe.

01:24:00.667 --> 01:24:04.626
With a bigger pump, so the pressure is
constant.

01:24:04.626 --> 01:24:05.876
Again?

01:24:05.876 --> 01:24:09.584
Deepen the well
and install a more powerful pump.

01:24:11.084 --> 01:24:13.667
How long will the work take?

01:24:14.126 --> 01:24:15.584
How long?

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:18.876
A month, a month-and-a-half.
- One to one-and-a-half months.

01:24:19.251 --> 01:24:21.251
Too long.
- That's too long.

01:24:23.001 --> 01:24:25.084
We could start tomorrow,

01:24:27.084 --> 01:24:28.376
if...

01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:34.751
I could take your daughter out to dinner.

01:24:38.459 --> 01:24:40.459
No, you can't.

01:24:44.459 --> 01:24:46.959
Viara, what's so terrible

01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:49.001
about me buying you dinner?

01:24:51.376 --> 01:24:54.709
Smoked food keeps better.
- And the hot stuff?

01:24:56.876 --> 01:25:01.376
Keep playing with the fire up here
and you'll stay frustrated.

01:25:02.251 --> 01:25:06.751
It's a blessing when you reach 40
and your testosterone diminishes.

01:25:08.459 --> 01:25:10.417
Had a shower, boss?

01:25:10.417 --> 01:25:13.417
Cold water?
Looks like it canceled out the Viagra.

01:25:14.376 --> 01:25:16.084
Isn't it working?

01:25:16.084 --> 01:25:17.376
"Viagra?"

01:25:17.959 --> 01:25:21.584
Watch what you say, and who you say it to.

01:25:21.959 --> 01:25:24.959
Back off or you'll see a different side of me.

01:25:24.959 --> 01:25:26.376
I'm talking!

01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:30.084
Keep your shit to yourself,
or we'll get real friendly.

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:32.459
We are friendly.
- Quiet.

01:25:33.084 --> 01:25:35.876
Or you'll see a different side. Shut your mouth!

01:25:42.459 --> 01:25:44.751
The pill's backfired on him.

01:25:45.667 --> 01:25:47.876
Tomorrow's a new day, Tommy.

01:27:22.167 --> 01:27:24.001
There was a guy here.

01:27:24.626 --> 01:27:26.584
Five minutes ago.

01:27:27.001 --> 01:27:29.626
And?
- Asked for a Légionnaire.

01:27:29.626 --> 01:27:31.667
I think he meant you.

01:27:34.376 --> 01:27:36.459
Did he want anything in particular?

01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:39.959
Not really. I didn't understand what he wanted.

01:27:42.209 --> 01:27:44.376
I told you he's fishy.

01:27:44.376 --> 01:27:46.917
Who's fishy?
- I'll tell you later.

01:27:46.917 --> 01:27:48.626
Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:58.792 --> 01:28:03.001
I can't wait till we've installed the drill
and are finally finished here.

01:28:03.626 --> 01:28:05.917
It's one problem after the next.

01:28:06.626 --> 01:28:08.667
Is the rumor true?

01:28:08.917 --> 01:28:10.709
The great Légionnaire!

01:28:13.126 --> 01:28:14.959
Have you seen the horse?

01:28:19.917 --> 01:28:23.709
Meinhard,
who was that guy that was here earlier?

01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:25.167
A friend.

01:28:41.376 --> 01:28:42.709
Tornado?

01:28:47.876 --> 01:28:49.292
Hey, Adrian.

01:28:54.376 --> 01:28:55.751
It happens.

01:28:57.959 --> 01:29:00.251
It probably fell from up there.

01:29:00.251 --> 01:29:03.292
Any chance?
- No, definitely not.

01:29:06.292 --> 01:29:09.376
It's fate.
- It won't pull through.

01:29:10.876 --> 01:29:12.709
Shame. A beautiful animal.

01:29:15.251 --> 01:29:16.751
That's life.

01:29:43.792 --> 01:29:45.376
Into the motor.

01:29:45.376 --> 01:29:47.001
Into the heart.

01:29:52.084 --> 01:29:53.167
Go ahead.

01:30:13.084 --> 01:30:15.876
Well done. You did well.

01:30:16.126 --> 01:30:18.251
It's fine.
- Don't worry about it.

01:30:18.251 --> 01:30:21.709
What do we do with the horse?
- Leave it here?

01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:23.376
It's what friends do.

01:31:10.959 --> 01:31:13.084
Adrian!
- It's not easy.

01:31:14.084 --> 01:31:16.292
With the jackhammer, right?
- What?

01:31:16.584 --> 01:31:19.417
With the jackhammer?
- Yeah, that's better.

01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:27.376
I'll tell him to use the jackhammer.

01:31:41.876 --> 01:31:45.917
It was healthy.
- Doesn't matter, it's a horse.

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:49.626
He'll take it.
That's the price. You have no other choice.

01:31:50.751 --> 01:31:54.584
He'll pick it up
and pay for transport and everything.

01:32:12.376 --> 01:32:13.917
What are you doing?

01:32:13.917 --> 01:32:15.167
Working.

01:32:15.167 --> 01:32:17.292
Working? We had an agreement.

01:32:17.876 --> 01:32:20.501
When will you stop screwing me over?

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:23.084
Look, times have changed.

01:32:23.584 --> 01:32:26.501
You were cozy, but now new people are in
power.

01:32:26.501 --> 01:32:29.584
I'll close your quarry,
then you'll see who's cozy.

01:32:29.584 --> 01:32:33.292
I'll give you 20 lev if you want.
- 20 lev, great!

01:32:33.626 --> 01:32:36.126
How much do you want? 100?
- Stop the equipment.

01:32:36.126 --> 01:32:37.876
It's legal.
- Legal?

01:32:37.876 --> 01:32:39.626
It's all legal.
- My ass!

01:32:39.626 --> 01:32:44.376
I've told him 100 times up to where he can dig.
Look how much he's dug.

01:32:45.501 --> 01:32:48.084
If you don't know the score, butt out.

01:32:50.376 --> 01:32:52.417
I don't want to argue with you.

01:32:52.417 --> 01:32:56.084
I'll get in trouble if I look the other way.

01:32:56.626 --> 01:32:59.084
You're looking the other way for me?
- Sure.

01:33:00.876 --> 01:33:02.917
Why are you laughing?

01:33:02.917 --> 01:33:05.084
None of your business.

01:33:05.084 --> 01:33:07.501
Why are you laughing?
- Don't touch me.

01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:10.584
None of your business.
- I warned you.

01:33:11.126 --> 01:33:12.292
Don't touch me.

01:33:14.001 --> 01:33:15.751
Who's he?

01:33:15.751 --> 01:33:18.376
Vassil, calm down.
- No, I won't.

01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:20.709
Get your dog off me.
- Get lost.

01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:22.584
Get your dog off me.

01:33:22.584 --> 01:33:25.251
Know what happens if you aim at the powerful?

01:33:25.251 --> 01:33:26.417
Calm down.

01:33:26.417 --> 01:33:28.876
Take the gun off him.
- He won't listen.

01:33:33.459 --> 01:33:35.876
What's this about?
- Calm down.

01:33:36.626 --> 01:33:37.501
Come on.

01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:40.001
He understands nothing.

01:33:41.126 --> 01:33:43.001
That's trouble.

01:33:46.667 --> 01:33:48.001
Fuck.

01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:50.501
That could've gotten ugly.

01:34:01.251 --> 01:34:02.584
Calm down.

01:34:03.001 --> 01:34:04.959
I would've killed him.
- It's OK.

01:34:04.959 --> 01:34:07.584
I don't give a damn! He shouldn't touch you!

01:34:12.584 --> 01:34:14.417
Have a smoke.

01:34:15.292 --> 01:34:16.876
Have a smoke.

01:34:17.751 --> 01:34:19.417
Calm down.

01:34:20.876 --> 01:34:23.376
I'd kill a guy like that!

01:34:23.376 --> 01:34:24.876
Story's over.

01:34:24.876 --> 01:34:27.126
I'm telling you, have a smoke.

01:34:28.584 --> 01:34:31.417
The pessimist says, "Couldn't have been
worse."

01:34:31.417 --> 01:34:33.584
The optimist says, "Could've been worse."

01:34:34.876 --> 01:34:38.167
Who would've thought we'd shoot a horse
today?

01:34:40.626 --> 01:34:42.917
And we almost shot a man, too!

01:34:43.751 --> 01:34:45.917
The guilty are always scared.

01:34:46.459 --> 01:34:49.917
Wanting something is one thing.
Getting it is something else.

01:35:53.167 --> 01:35:55.876
Next time, you'll be lying here.

01:35:58.001 --> 01:36:00.792
I didn't do it on purpose.
It was an accident.

01:36:00.792 --> 01:36:03.792
Next time, it'll be you.
- It just happened.

01:36:06.626 --> 01:36:08.209
Was it your horse?

01:36:12.126 --> 01:36:13.751
Just get over it.

01:36:14.501 --> 01:36:15.917
Get over it.

01:36:19.876 --> 01:36:21.667
We came here to work.

01:37:04.459 --> 01:37:05.876
Hey.
- Hi there.

01:37:05.876 --> 01:37:08.084
Is that gravel?
- Sure is: gravel.

01:37:08.084 --> 01:37:09.167
Great.

01:37:09.167 --> 01:37:10.667
Howdy, ranger!

01:37:12.292 --> 01:37:14.084
Hi.
- Hey, guys.

01:37:14.084 --> 01:37:16.417
All good.
- He trusts us today.

01:37:20.251 --> 01:37:21.251
Maria!

01:37:21.501 --> 01:37:22.876
Beer?

01:38:04.084 --> 01:38:05.292
May I?

01:38:07.167 --> 01:38:08.751
Where's Vincent?

01:38:09.292 --> 01:38:11.001
Is he coming?

01:38:12.626 --> 01:38:14.376
Were you expecting him?

01:38:14.376 --> 01:38:15.626
Yes,

01:38:15.626 --> 01:38:17.459
to translate.

01:38:19.876 --> 01:38:21.376
Translator.

01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:27.209
Good.

01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:39.584
I'm off.

01:38:43.001 --> 01:38:44.626
May I join you?

01:39:01.876 --> 01:39:03.376
What's up?

01:39:06.792 --> 01:39:09.209
Is there a problem?
- No, we're just chatting.

01:39:10.292 --> 01:39:11.667
Bye.

01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:16.376
I have to go.

01:39:20.084 --> 01:39:21.376
Such a short walk?

01:39:25.917 --> 01:39:27.584
What does your name mean?

01:39:28.167 --> 01:39:31.084
Faith.
- Faith. Don't you have faith in me?

01:39:32.959 --> 01:39:34.876
Thanks.
- Don't you have faith in me?

01:39:41.001 --> 01:39:42.667
How long have you been away?

01:39:43.126 --> 01:39:44.417
Five years.

01:39:47.626 --> 01:39:48.876
Thanks.

01:39:53.167 --> 01:39:55.084
I love this village.

01:39:55.376 --> 01:39:57.459
I always miss it.

01:39:58.626 --> 01:40:00.584
Don't you get homesick?

01:40:06.209 --> 01:40:08.209
What's homesick?

01:40:16.001 --> 01:40:19.209
Have you and Vincent
known each other for long?

01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:23.959
Friends?

01:40:23.959 --> 01:40:25.292
Co-workers.

01:40:28.876 --> 01:40:30.667
Lots of questions.

01:41:05.876 --> 01:41:09.417
Take a seat, man. Have a drink.
- Sit down.

01:41:09.417 --> 01:41:12.459
Check out his shirt.
- Were you at a wedding?

01:41:13.376 --> 01:41:15.084
I doubt it.

01:41:15.584 --> 01:41:17.376
He's all dressed up.

01:41:19.084 --> 01:41:20.584
Hey, guys!

01:41:21.584 --> 01:41:22.876
Sit down.

01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:24.667
Have a drink.

01:41:26.459 --> 01:41:27.959
Where've you been?

01:41:28.209 --> 01:41:29.959
I had stuff to do.

01:41:31.417 --> 01:41:34.417
All finished?
- Chores have to be done.

01:41:36.084 --> 01:41:38.126
Meinhard! Captain, how many?

01:41:40.209 --> 01:41:42.167
Commander, how many...

01:41:42.167 --> 01:41:43.792
...stars?

01:41:47.584 --> 01:41:50.209
How many years in Iraq?

01:41:50.209 --> 01:41:52.501
One, two, three, four...

01:41:52.501 --> 01:41:54.667
How many years in Iraq?

01:41:56.126 --> 01:41:58.876
Did you kill? Did you kill anyone?

01:42:06.001 --> 01:42:08.751
Killing isn't as easy as you think.

01:42:09.501 --> 01:42:11.376
It's not easy...

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:13.876
...to kill someone.

01:42:14.876 --> 01:42:16.167
You're forced to.

01:42:17.084 --> 01:42:19.959
It's the law of the jungle. The strongest...

01:42:19.959 --> 01:42:22.584
Maybe he's traumatized.

01:42:23.126 --> 01:42:25.792
Maybe he was a cook?
- Head chef.

01:42:27.084 --> 01:42:29.084
With a chef's hat!

01:42:42.209 --> 01:42:43.751
Going for a walk?

01:42:44.792 --> 01:42:46.376
I don't understand.

01:42:47.084 --> 01:42:48.959
The other night,

01:42:48.959 --> 01:42:50.751
we were drunk.

01:42:51.917 --> 01:42:55.001
We played cards and I lost all my money.

01:42:56.959 --> 01:43:01.001
If you can, please give it back.

01:43:01.376 --> 01:43:03.376
You had your chance.

01:43:04.209 --> 01:43:08.876
I have problems at home.
Please give it back.

01:43:12.251 --> 01:43:13.584
Buddy.

01:43:16.084 --> 01:43:19.667
Problems at home because of money.

01:43:28.084 --> 01:43:30.501
All of it.
- Now go.

01:43:31.376 --> 01:43:32.584
Go.

01:43:36.001 --> 01:43:37.459
Get lost.

01:43:41.292 --> 01:43:43.959
Please give it back if you can.
- Get lost.

01:43:44.376 --> 01:43:45.626
Go!

01:43:45.626 --> 01:43:47.209
You don't want to?

01:43:48.001 --> 01:43:50.251
You'll go back to Germany anyway.

01:43:51.292 --> 01:43:53.751
Why waste my time on you?

01:44:29.001 --> 01:44:31.084
Here's what you get, dude.

01:44:40.251 --> 01:44:42.001
He's got a knife!

01:44:49.917 --> 01:44:51.417
Asshole.

01:45:55.584 --> 01:45:56.959
What's up?

01:45:57.209 --> 01:45:58.876
Come on, get in.

01:49:10.001 --> 01:49:11.209
Souvenir.

01:49:13.126 --> 01:49:15.084
From me. To you.

01:49:37.376 --> 01:49:38.959
What's that?

01:49:39.792 --> 01:49:41.792
What happened there?
- Nothing.

01:49:42.959 --> 01:49:45.959
Nothing? Oh, in Bulgarian! "Nothing."

01:50:16.001 --> 01:50:17.126
Adrian?

01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:19.376
Have you seen Adrian?

01:50:46.626 --> 01:50:49.376
I'm here.
- Haven't seen you in a while.

01:51:05.876 --> 01:51:07.709
Overall, I'm satisfied.

01:51:08.751 --> 01:51:10.584
Have they graduated yet?

01:51:10.584 --> 01:51:13.876
Ours is a third-year student in Sofia.

01:51:36.084 --> 01:51:37.417
Wait!

01:51:37.876 --> 01:51:39.876
You've been showing off lately.

01:51:39.876 --> 01:51:41.459
Real strong, real brave.

01:51:41.459 --> 01:51:43.459
Brave enough to mess with women.

01:51:43.459 --> 01:51:46.084
Why not mess with a Bulgarian man?
- Stop it.

01:51:47.001 --> 01:51:49.167
How long do we have to put up with you?

01:51:55.584 --> 01:51:56.792
Asshole!

01:51:57.792 --> 01:51:59.251
Fraud!

01:51:59.584 --> 01:52:01.876
Look, he's down.
- So what?

01:52:02.376 --> 01:52:04.084
He deserved it.

01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:06.376
Let's get a drink.

01:52:06.667 --> 01:52:08.292
I don't care about that dumb-ass.

01:52:09.626 --> 01:52:11.626
A German Légionnaire!

01:52:40.209 --> 01:52:41.417
You OK?

01:52:47.667 --> 01:52:50.167
That's how villages are.
Anything can happen.

01:52:51.417 --> 01:52:53.376
Vanko doesn't need that.

01:52:56.292 --> 01:52:59.167
What are you searching for here?
