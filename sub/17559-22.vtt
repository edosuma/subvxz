00:08.048 --> 00:10.427
Hey, sweetie.
How you feeling?

00:10.510 --> 00:12.679
Ugh!

00:12.762 --> 00:15.890
- Well, I made you a sandwich.
- Oh, I can't eat.

00:15.974 --> 00:19.519
But thank you so much
for letting me stay here.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.439
You know, I live alone.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.607
- I know.
- I got nobody.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.651
[chuckles]
I know.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.862
If I died,
it'd be two, three weeks

00:28.945 --> 00:31.448
before somebody
started smelling me.

00:32.698 --> 00:36.870
- I don't want that.
- Nobody wants that.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.789
But you know something, it's
good that I'm here for you too.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.249
Why is that?

00:41.332 --> 00:42.792
'Cause I can help
keep your mind off Rick.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.127
Remember,
'cause you still love him

00:44.210 --> 00:46.796
and he's getting married today.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.716
- Is that today? Hmm.
- Oh, look at you.

00:49.799 --> 00:53.136
All trying to cover up
your pain.

00:53.219 --> 00:56.806
I'm so sorry, you know.
It must be killing you.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.058
Wow, look at that. You took
my mind right off of it.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.728
- Oh, good.
- I'm going. I'm going.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.438
- I'm going to Paris.
- You got the internship?

01:03.521 --> 01:05.272
I got the internship.

01:05.355 --> 01:08.318
Paris loves Holly.
Holly <i> je suis</i> happy.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.487
Oh, my God.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.280
You did it. You did it.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.824
[both screaming]

01:14.908 --> 01:16.326
Yay, I know.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.204
Okay, I may blow chunks.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.955
Okay.
Okay, when do you leave?

01:21.039 --> 01:23.082
- A week.
- A week? That's it?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.210
I only have my baby sister
for one more week.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.796
And then she graduates
and leaves me forever?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.465
I'm not dying.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.925
But I am.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.010
Okay, we, we, we have
to go get your tickets

01:34.093 --> 01:35.887
your passport and we're gonna
get you some new clothes.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.515
Oh, I'm so excited for you.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.017
Don't leave me alone up here.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.727

The famous one in Paris.

02:38.157 --> 02:41.494
That's great. I'm unbelievably
excited for you.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.081
Yeah, me too.
Unbelievably excited.

02:45.164 --> 02:49.294
Seriously, it's <i> so</i> great.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.547
Yeah, seriously, the greatest.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.592

You're bumming me out.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.051
Well, I'm sorry,
but you're gonna be gone

02:57.135 --> 02:58.428
like the whole summer.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.762
I mean,
my mom's always telling me

02:59.846 --> 03:02.098
that your life doesn't
revolve around Holly Tyler

03:02.181 --> 03:04.976
but it does. It so does.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.479
Yeah, she's nothing without you.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.940
Okay, and what are you gonna
be doing while she's gone?

03:11.024 --> 03:13.192
Well, unlike you,
I am my own person.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.945
I don't rely on one individual
to make my life complete.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.490
Mm-hmm, then how come you cried
when you read the letter?

03:19.574 --> 03:22.076
Tears of joy, girl.
Tears of joy.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.080
Argh. So when do you have
to be in freakin' Paris?

03:26.164 --> 03:28.082
Well, officially not until
next week, but Val got

03:28.166 --> 03:30.668
a really great deal on tickets
if I leave in three days.

03:30.752 --> 03:34.255
Three days? Well, I thought we
were gonna go bowling next week.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.426
Henry. Hey.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.345
Look.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.180
Yes, I knew it.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.974
Wait there.
You see that, downers?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.851
That is how an actual person
gets excited

03:46.935 --> 03:49.520
for another actual person
with good news.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.274
I'm not hanging out
with you this summer.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.693
I'm not hanging out
with you either.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.323
- Wanna go bowling next week?
- Sure.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.909
- You're going to Paris.
- I'm so going to Paris.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.285
[laughing]

04:05.787 --> 04:08.164
If you hadn't helped me
with that essay..

04:18.882 --> 04:20.510
- We kissed.
- I know. What was that?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.387
- It just happened.
- How did that happen?

04:22.470 --> 04:24.681
- You have Kate.
- Not anymore. We broke up.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.849
[gasps]
Oh, God.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.103
Is it 'cause she found out
about this?

04:32.689 --> 04:34.899
[Henry sighs]

04:34.983 --> 04:37.652
Um..

04:37.735 --> 04:40.655
- Uh, when do you leave?
- Three days.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.448
Three days.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.370
So what does this mean?

04:47.453 --> 04:48.621
It means you're going to Paris

04:48.705 --> 04:50.790
and you're gonna
have a great summer.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.376
And we'll figure it out
when you get back.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.133
- Wanna kiss again?
- Uh-huh.

05:22.739 --> 05:27.493
- Oh, what are you doing?
- I ran out of juice.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.622
- Why are you lying here?
- I ran out of gas.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.208
Alright, get back in bed and I
will go get you some more juice.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.752
No, no, wait, don't leave.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.420
I have to talk to you
about something.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.548
Okay, well, uh,
get back in bed first.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.758
Come on.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.260
Do you know how much
I love you?

05:44.343 --> 05:47.430
I know how much codeine
was in that cough medicine.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.849
Oh, no, I love you more.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.436
Alright.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.438
Look, I don't wanna
scare you

05:55.521 --> 05:59.025
but I think this is more
serious than we thought.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.486
I think I have
the bird flu.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.113
- Lauren--
- No, no, okay.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.784
This is serious, alright?
Please, just listen to me here.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.619
If something should
happen to me

06:09.702 --> 06:11.537
I need you
to go to my apartment.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.456
In my nightstand, second drawer

06:13.539 --> 06:15.792
in the very, very back
on the way right

06:15.875 --> 06:18.044
under my personal
Lauren stationery

06:18.127 --> 06:20.254
there is a long box.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.299
I need you to get it
out of the house

06:23.382 --> 06:26.344
immediately upon my death.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.221
- Oh, God.
- No, no, no, look, okay.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.514
You would be saving my family

06:29.597 --> 06:33.267
from a great deal
of embarrassment.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.146
Also, I'd like
to be buried with it.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.649
- Lauren--
- No, please?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.734
Okay, okay,
whatever you want

06:41.818 --> 06:43.986
but if you don't die

06:44.070 --> 06:46.239
do you think you can get
better in three days?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.741
I don't know.
Do you need me to do some work?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.952
[coughs]

06:51.035 --> 06:54.413
No, it's just that I'm not
gonna be here in three days.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.832
Oh, my God.
What do you have?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.834
Do you think it's monkey pox?

06:57.917 --> 07:01.212
Do you need me to get rid of
anything in your nightstand?

07:01.295 --> 07:05.842
God, no, no. And don't go
snooping around in there either.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.011
Listen, when I was at the
travel agency earlier with Holly

07:09.095 --> 07:11.013
I looked up
and I saw a poster of Venice.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.016
Venice, I have wanted
to go there my whole life.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.726
So I figure with Holly leaving

07:15.810 --> 07:17.520
and the whole
Rick-getting-married thing

07:17.603 --> 07:19.397
it's the perfect thing to do.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.525
- Oh, so you're going to Venice.
- Yeah.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.361
[singsong]
I'm going to Venice.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.697
Oh, well, that's great.
You know, I'm..

07:27.780 --> 07:31.200
- I'm really happy for you.
- Wait, where are you going?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.994
To pack my things.
Mm-hmm.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.705
There's a hospice two blocks
down from my apartment.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.874
Maybe they're staying on the
mainland and will have time

07:37.957 --> 07:40.001
to take care of me.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.545
Bummer.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.673
If you go there, who am I gonna
give this extra ticket to?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.177
What?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.595
The airfares were so cheap

07:50.678 --> 07:53.097
I thought it would be fun
to bring a friend.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.558
Oh, my God.
I'm going to Venice.

07:55.641 --> 07:59.061
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.814
You are the most
thoughtful, generous

08:01.898 --> 08:05.359
most giving person
I have ever known.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.528
Coach?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.750
[knock on door]

08:24.462 --> 08:26.130
- Hey, Vince.
- Hey, that's for you.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.673
- Thanks.
- Sign here.

08:27.757 --> 08:28.966
Okay.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.968
- Is, uh, Holly around?
- No. Why?

08:31.052 --> 08:35.890
'Cause whenever she's here,
she always offers me a soda

08:35.972 --> 08:38.893
and a sandwich.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.895
Help yourself.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.025
Oh. Rick's wedding invitation.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.110
Yeah, I was just cleaning up
and I found that.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.737
I was gonna throw it out,
but then you came along

08:49.820 --> 08:51.572
and ruined everything.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.824
- Getting married today, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.661
- Sorry.
- Oh, nothing to be sorry about.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.205
Julie is a great gal.
Rick is very happy.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.874
I wish them both well.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.668
So you have
no problem with it.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.086
Not a one.

09:05.169 --> 09:09.131
Then why did you cross off
Julie's name and write yours?

09:09.215 --> 09:10.299
Lauren did that.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.343
She thought it would be funny.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.471
I did not care for it.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.932
You do know there's, like,
a million other guys out there

09:18.015 --> 09:20.101
who would totally
wanna hook up with you.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.144
Thanks.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.647
But why can't it be him?

09:24.730 --> 09:25.815
We are so good together.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.775
I mean, we could stay up
all night talking

09:27.858 --> 09:28.818
and never
run out of stuff to say.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.403
We laugh at the same things.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.530
I would be thinking about him
and then he would call.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.407
I mean, except for
the whole fiancee thing

09:34.490 --> 09:37.660
it was a fairy tale.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.911
You know what you should do?

09:38.995 --> 09:41.372
You should tear that up
and throw it away.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.707
You know what?
You are exactly right.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.209
That is exactly
what I am gonna do.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.879
[clears throat]

09:48.963 --> 09:50.673
Hmm.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.508
Do you want me to do it?

09:52.591 --> 09:54.969
No, unh-unh.
I-I need to do it.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.855
You know what,
that felt really good.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.107
Yeah, really good.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.444
- You helped me.
- Well, you gave me a soda.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.280
The least I can do
is change your life.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.032
So what'd you get
from the travel agency?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.534
Oh, it's my tourist packet.
I'm going to Venice.

10:18.617 --> 10:20.828
Venice? That's great.
When are you going?

10:20.911 --> 10:23.789
Oh, in three days. I was with
Holly getting her tickets--

10:23.873 --> 10:25.833
- What tickets?
- Oh, you didn't hear?

10:25.916 --> 10:28.002
She got accepted
to her internship.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.379
She's going to Paris?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.423
Yeah, we both leave
in three days.

10:32.506 --> 10:35.885
- How long is she gonna be gone?
- The whole summer.

10:35.968 --> 10:40.014
- The whole summer?
- Yeah. You okay?

10:40.097 --> 10:43.142
Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm great.
I'm just really happy for her.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.313
Hey.
What are you doing here?

10:47.396 --> 10:48.731
Uh, dropping off
a package.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.441
Val told me
about your internship.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.444
That's fantastic.
I'm so happy for you.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.404
Thanks.
I'm pretty happy myself.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.408
A whole summer in Paris.
That's awesome.

10:59.492 --> 11:03.746
(Lauren)
'Need Val.'

11:03.829 --> 11:07.083
Yeah, it was a real good idea
letting her stay here.

11:07.166 --> 11:11.003
Okay, well, uh, thanks for the
whole envelope ripping thing.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.256
- What was that about?
- Uh, nothing.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.801
I just gave her
some excellent advice.

11:16.884 --> 11:20.721
- So the whole summer, huh?
- Yeah, the whole summer.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.515
It's gonna be kind of weird
not having you around.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.017
- I kinda--
- I'm sure you'll do fine.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.560
Well, you just, you know
you get used to seeing

11:26.644 --> 11:29.355
a person every day
and talking to them and stuff

11:29.438 --> 11:30.606
and then when
they're not there--

11:30.689 --> 11:33.275
Because they're going
to Paris?

11:33.359 --> 11:37.321
Yeah.
Paris, the whole summer.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.491
I guess what I'm trying to say
is I'm just really gonna--

11:40.574 --> 11:42.243
Gonna what?

11:50.876 --> 11:53.546
What are you doing?

11:53.629 --> 11:55.798
- Same thing you were doing.
- But why are you doing it?

11:55.881 --> 11:57.216
What is wrong with you?

11:57.299 --> 11:59.301
It seemed like
you kind of liked it.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.970
Where would you get
that idea?

12:01.053 --> 12:04.056
You know, you can't just
go around kissing people.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.475
No, look, I know
what you're worried about

12:06.559 --> 12:08.811
but you don't have to worry
about that anymore.

12:08.894 --> 12:13.357
- Holly, I'm ready.
- For what?

12:13.441 --> 12:16.485
For, you know,
for you and me to be together.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.653
[gasps]

12:17.736 --> 12:21.699
Lord, did you hear that?
Vince is ready.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.285
[gasps]
Look, the heavens
have opened.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.162
My prayers
have been answered.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.622
Thank you, thank you, Lord.

12:30.624 --> 12:31.709
Why are you doing that?

12:31.792 --> 12:33.836
You're kind of
hurting my feelings.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.714
Do you hear yourself?
You're ready?

12:36.797 --> 12:38.674
You think that I have
just been sitting around here

12:38.757 --> 12:40.551
waiting for you
to be ready?

12:40.634 --> 12:42.970
This is what you wanted.
I mean, this is what I want.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.514
- Since when?
- Since now.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.349
Okay, what'd you do last night?

12:47.433 --> 12:51.270
Went out with a...friend
of mine.

12:51.353 --> 12:54.690
Does this friend pee
sitting down?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.359
What difference does it make
who I went out with last night?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.236
I'm telling you now
that I'm--

12:59.320 --> 13:02.364
Now that I'm going
to Paris for the summer.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.366
Holly, I'm ready
to make a commitment.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.035
Oh, are you?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.454
Okay, then tell me this.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.081
If you hadn't found out I was
going to Paris for the summer

13:11.165 --> 13:12.917
would you still feel
this way right now?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.668
- I--
- Liar.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.004
You know, it's easy for a person
to make a commitment

13:17.087 --> 13:18.839
when the other person
is going out of the country.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.383
Look, you can believe whatever
you want, but I know how I feel

13:21.467 --> 13:24.220
and I'm telling you
I'm ready to make a commitment.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.930
Well, it's too late.

13:26.013 --> 13:29.141
I am going to Paris where the
men are known for commitment.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.728
You know what, forget it.
Go to Paris.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.104
- Have a nice trip.
- I will.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.065
- And you have a nice summer.
- I will.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.692
And just so you know, the friend
I went out with last night

13:38.776 --> 13:42.029
does pee sitting down, but
she can also pee standing up

13:42.112 --> 13:43.781
so ha.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.417
Ooh, Lauren, look,
they're gonna have two festivals

13:55.501 --> 13:56.502
while we're in Venice.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.671
Ooh,<i> bellissimo.</i>

13:58.754 --> 14:01.006
I'm <i> excited-issimo.</i>

14:02.716 --> 14:03.759
Sounds fun.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.761
The Festa Della Sensa.

14:05.844 --> 14:10.432
We are gonna have
a total <i> blast-iola.</i>

14:10.516 --> 14:12.142
Hey, would you stop doing that?

14:12.226 --> 14:14.853
Just because you put
an <i> issimo</i> or <i> iola</i>

14:14.937 --> 14:18.691
at the end of the word
doesn't make it Italian.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.484
Ooh, where did that come from?

14:20.568 --> 14:24.488
Someone still a little uptight
over the wedding of <i> Rick-aroni?</i>

14:26.907 --> 14:28.617
- Vince just kissed me.
- What?

14:28.701 --> 14:31.495
Yeah, he said he's ready
to commit to a relationship.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.622
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah, you'd think.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.291
But it's just
because I'm leaving.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.918
As soon as he knows he can't
have something, he wants it.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.838
He's sick, and I hate him.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.798
Wait, so he just grabbed you
and kissed you?

14:42.881 --> 14:45.926
Yeah, it was awesome.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.804
It was awesome? Wait,
does this mean you guys are..

14:48.887 --> 14:51.515
No, and besides,
I have a situation with Henry.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.142
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.769
About a half-hour ago,
he laid one on me too.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.689
I must be looking good.

14:58.772 --> 15:02.067
- Well, how was that one?
- Oh, so sweet and so nice.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.777
Wait a second.
Doesn't Henry have a girlfriend?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.988
Not anymore.
It's just, he's so frustrating.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.657
I mean, he had months
to do this.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.327
- Henry?
- No, Vince.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.829
But I feel so comfortable
with him.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.914
- Vince?
- No, Henry.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.917
But when he kissed me, mmm..

15:19.001 --> 15:20.544
Henry.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.254
Well, but what about
Vince's kiss?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.797
You said that was awesome.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.842
When did I say that?

15:26.925 --> 15:30.054
Why'd he have to do it now?

15:30.137 --> 15:32.097
- Vince or Henry?
- Doesn't matter.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.892
I'm gonna see if I can get her
on a plane in ten minutes.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.575
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.
I got a cab waiting downstairs.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.702
Hey, will you help me
with this, please?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.997
- Thank you.
- Ow.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.042
Alright,
do you have your tickets?

16:00.125 --> 16:01.502
- In my purse.
- Your passport?

16:01.585 --> 16:03.587
- In my purse.
- Your purse?

16:03.671 --> 16:06.423
- Don't know.
- Holly?

16:06.507 --> 16:08.717
What are you doing out of bed?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.636
She forgot her tickets,
her passport

16:10.719 --> 16:11.929
and her purse all on my bed.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.389
I swear, if your head
weren't screwed..

16:13.472 --> 16:15.724
Oh, no, too weak to continue.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.811
Look how sick you are.
You're not going to the airport.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.646
Are you crazy?
Lauren, help me up.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.898
I'm gonna go to the airport. I
wanna say goodbye to my sister.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.067
- Okay.
- We said goodbye 12 times.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.736
You can't go to the airport.
You can't even stand up.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.656
They got wheelchairs.
I've seen them.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.408
- You can't go.
- No, it's okay.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.369
There's a reason that you and I
aren't going to Venice today.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.496
I don't know what it is,
but there is a reason.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.790
I know what it is.
You.

16:39.873 --> 16:42.376
You sneezed all over me.

16:42.459 --> 16:46.088
Now I'm not gonna get to go
to the Festival Della Sensa

16:46.171 --> 16:49.133
or the Vogalonga.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.801
But you can go next month
and they'll have

16:50.884 --> 16:52.302
even better festivals then.

16:52.386 --> 16:56.890
Oh, it doesn't get
any better than the Vogalonga.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.852
But when you come,
you can visit me.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.896
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you more.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.440
No, no,
I don't wanna get you sick.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.276
- I don't care. Hug me.
- Mmm.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.319
- I love you.
- I love you.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.946
- I'll call you from the plane.
- Okay, bye.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.489
and you can totally
say no to this

18:35.572 --> 18:37.658

about me coming to spend

get off the phone yet.
