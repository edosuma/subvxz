WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:03.003
- Previously on
"God Friended Me"...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.352
- Can I have everybody's
attention?

00:04.395 --> 00:06.876
IdentitySeal has been sold.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.530
- To who?
- Simon Hayes.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.749
- What if Simon Hayes
is behind the God Account?

00:10.793 --> 00:12.882
- Simon wants to design
the first app

00:12.925 --> 00:15.711
that can analyze
and identify potential fraud.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.279
I want you to lead the team
that's going to code it.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.629
- Surprise!
- Hey, what's up with the bags?

00:20.672 --> 00:22.152
- Is it cool if I crash here
for a couple days?

00:22.196 --> 00:24.067
- Of course, of course.
As much time as you need.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.852
- Dee and I got into
a huge fight.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.637
I just don't think she's
the right one for me.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.074
- I'm sorry.
I'm lucky to have you.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.424
- You're gonna be happy to
have me a little while longer.

00:34.643 --> 00:36.166
- ♪ Ooh

00:38.038 --> 00:40.997
- There are many paths
life can take you on,

00:41.041 --> 00:44.435
but for most of us, where we
end up isn't always where

00:44.479 --> 00:46.263
we imagine our lives
would turn out,

00:46.307 --> 00:50.572
so it is only natural for us
to question how we got here.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.487
You--
- Got to be kidding me!

00:52.530 --> 00:55.098
No, no, no, you've been on
the schedule since last week.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.448
I can't.
I have clinicals at noon.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.102
I have a thesis meeting
at 2:00.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.365
No--and then I have
to TA a lecture. I can't.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.063
Yeah, yeah.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.850
No, let me call you back.
All right.

01:07.893 --> 01:10.548
I'm sorry, my barback
had an audition,

01:10.592 --> 01:12.898
and I didn't know
you were recording.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.596
- Nah, it's okay.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.598
- Are you sure you're not mad?

01:16.641 --> 01:18.165
Having me here is a lot.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.254
- I'm not mad.
I'm proud.

01:20.297 --> 01:21.777
Yeah, I forgot about
all the stuff

01:21.820 --> 01:24.606
that you're juggling
with school, the bar.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.521
- Yeah.
- Sis, you are a badass.

01:26.564 --> 01:29.828
- Hey, thanks.
And don't worry.

01:29.872 --> 01:32.831
I will be out of your hair,
find my own place, I promise.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.572
- Al, you know I love
having you here,

01:34.616 --> 01:37.097
although it would be nice if I
could have just a little bit

01:37.140 --> 01:40.404
of hot water in the morning.
I'd really appreciate it.

01:40.448 --> 01:43.320
- You are the best big bro
a girl can ask for.

01:43.364 --> 01:44.800
- All right,
I gotta get to work.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.367
- All right.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.890
- Miles, I got a big problem,
dude.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.848
It's my team.
They hate me.

01:49.892 --> 01:52.199
- Hey, are you sure
you're not overreacting?

01:52.242 --> 01:54.201
Okay, what exactly
did they say?

01:54.244 --> 01:56.028
- It's not about words, Miles.

01:56.072 --> 01:58.030
I'm really good at reading
body language,

01:58.074 --> 02:01.208
and their body language tells
me that they do not like me.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.035
- Well, yeah,
because you're the boss.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.603
Everybody hates the boss.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.301
We hate Phil.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.172
- True.
- Right.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.435
- It's just, I have this need
to be liked, all right?

02:11.479 --> 02:13.568
It's this curse all Singh men
are born with.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.310
- Look, bro, I think
you're imagining it, okay?

02:16.353 --> 02:19.574
Be yourself.
Everything else will work out.

02:19.617 --> 02:22.794
- Yeah.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.753
What's up?
- It's Cara.

02:24.796 --> 02:25.884
We're supposed to be
getting lunch.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.538
You wanna come with?

02:27.582 --> 02:30.715
- I'd love to, but I gotta go
win my team over.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.630
You are lucky, Miles.

02:32.674 --> 02:35.807
CSR, no responsibilities.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.853
I miss those days.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.290
All right.

02:40.334 --> 02:43.163
Say hi to Cara.
- Yup.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.820
Can I ask you something?

02:48.864 --> 02:51.127
Have you ever felt like
your life

02:51.171 --> 02:53.390
isn't where
you expected it to be?

02:53.434 --> 02:54.696
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

02:54.739 --> 02:57.438
- Yeah, of course.
Everyone does.

02:57.481 --> 03:00.005
Where is this coming from?

03:00.049 --> 03:03.705
- It's just, Ali's getting her
PhD and running the bar.

03:03.748 --> 03:07.012
You're at the top of the
leader board every week.

03:07.056 --> 03:09.972
Rakesh is running his team.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.582
I just don't want to wake up
in my 30s

03:11.626 --> 03:13.062
still trying to get
my podcast off the ground,

03:13.105 --> 03:15.586
working at IdentitySeal.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.806
- You know what I think?

03:17.849 --> 03:19.547
I think you should submit
your podcast again.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.070
- No, no, it didn't work out
last time.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.419
You remember,
with Frequency?

03:22.463 --> 03:24.639
- Yes, but there's a new
podcast collective

03:24.682 --> 03:26.031
called FreeVerse.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.772
They're kinda like
an upstart NPR,

03:27.816 --> 03:29.383
not corporate at all,

03:29.426 --> 03:30.862
and they're looking
for new shows.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.255
- Look, last thing I need
right now, Cara,

03:32.299 --> 03:34.257
is for another station
to tell me

03:34.301 --> 03:36.781
what my podcast
should or shouldn't be.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.392
- Yeah, but you don't know
that's what it's gonna be like.

03:38.435 --> 03:41.656
- Miles!

03:41.699 --> 03:44.267
- Cal!
Whoa.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.574
- It's really you, man.
It's been, what, seven years?

03:46.617 --> 03:48.532
- Yeah, what--what are you
doing back in town?

03:48.576 --> 03:50.142
- Oh, I moved back
a couple years ago.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.710
- Oh, I didn't hear.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.886
- Hi, I'm Cara.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.932
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
This is Cara Bloom.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.586
Cal and I went
to high school together.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.718
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.938
- Yo, Cal, so how you been?

04:02.981 --> 04:04.809
- Good, good.
Man, things couldn't be better.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.376
What about you?

04:06.420 --> 04:08.291
Still trying to convince
the world God doesn't exist?

04:08.335 --> 04:10.728
- Uh, yeah,
something like that.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.904
I got a podcast.
It's doing really great.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.689
Big following,
so no complaints.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.821
- Oh, that's good to hear.

04:16.865 --> 04:19.084
Well, anyway,
I gotta run but, man,

04:19.128 --> 04:20.564
it was good bumping into you.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.958
- Yeah, yeah, you too, man.
- All right.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.310
- Uh, big following?

04:28.398 --> 04:32.141
It's a long story.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.143
It was always
a competition between us.

04:34.186 --> 04:37.320
- So I take it you two weren't
best friends in high school?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.453
- Actually, we were.
- Really?

04:39.496 --> 04:40.715
- Yup.
- What happened?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.893
Oh, we got a new
Friend Suggestion.

04:44.936 --> 04:47.461
Derrick Gomez,
17 years old

04:47.504 --> 04:51.943
and plays...baseball
for my high school?

04:51.987 --> 04:54.598
- Wait, so you haven't seen Cal
in years and then we get

04:54.642 --> 04:56.818
a Friend Suggestion for someone
from your high school?

04:56.861 --> 04:59.037
- Yeah, well, maybe the God
Account is feeling nostalgic.

04:59.081 --> 05:01.475
- Or it's no coincidence.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.912
- Oh, he just posted.
"Heading to practice."

05:03.955 --> 05:05.740
All right, let's get down there
and see what we can find out.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.742
- Okay.

05:07.785 --> 05:09.700
- Lester, come in.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.441
- Thanks for seeing me, Arthur.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.225
- Everything good
at the vestry?

05:13.269 --> 05:15.619
- The board is fine.
- Uh-huh.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.492
- The reason I came to see you
is because the diocese

05:18.535 --> 05:21.190
has decided to send us
a new assistant rector.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.192
- Really?

05:23.235 --> 05:27.501
We haven't had an assistant
priest in...years.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.893
- Which means
we're long overdue.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.505
- His name's
Reverend Andrew Carver.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.855
- Mm.
- They're very high on him.

05:33.898 --> 05:37.685
- I appreciate that, but
I really don't need the help.

05:37.728 --> 05:40.340
- Arthur, I know how important
this church is to you,

05:40.383 --> 05:42.429
but after 25 years,
do you really want to do

05:42.472 --> 05:44.300
every single afternoon service?

05:44.344 --> 05:50.175
- Yes, but...clearly this is
what the diocese wants,

05:50.219 --> 05:53.396
and of course I will happily
welcome Reverend Carver.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.963
- Wonderful.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.052
I'll set up a time
for you two to sit down.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.097
- Look forward to it.

06:10.108 --> 06:13.024
- Whoo,
kid's got a live arm.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.287
It explains why
the scouts are here.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.289
- According to Derrick's
Facebook page,

06:17.333 --> 06:19.161
he's one of the best
high school pitching prospects

06:19.204 --> 06:20.554
in the country.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.818
You okay?

06:23.861 --> 06:28.039
- Yeah, yeah,
it's...just strange,

06:28.083 --> 06:31.782
running into Cal and being
back out on this field.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.524
- What do you mean?

06:34.568 --> 06:36.874
- Cal and I played baseball
together in high school.

06:36.918 --> 06:40.312
He was the pitcher
and I was his catcher.

06:40.356 --> 06:41.618
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.272
- I mean, I knew
that you liked baseball.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.491
I didn't know you played.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.536
- Second team, all-city.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.843
Made it into the semifinals
my senior year.

06:48.886 --> 06:51.149
The winner got
to move on to play

06:51.193 --> 06:53.717
in the championship
at Yankee Stadium.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.502
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.678
- And you lost.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.767
- We were up two
in the bottom of the ninth.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.377
Two on, two out.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.639
The batter had double
off Cal

07:02.683 --> 07:03.945
on a curve
earlier in the game,

07:03.988 --> 07:06.426
so I called for a fastball.

07:06.469 --> 07:09.777
Cal shook me off
and threw the curve.

07:09.820 --> 07:13.258
The batter ripped a home run.

07:15.304 --> 07:18.742
Cal and I got into
a huge argument.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.483
We stopped talking
to each other.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.833
Cal was a pro prospect.

07:22.877 --> 07:26.446
He went off to the minors,
got injured,

07:26.489 --> 07:29.536
and I have not
seen him since.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.452
- So you lost
your best friend over a game?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.497
- Well, it wasn't
just about the game.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.416
I said something
he didn't want to hear

07:40.460 --> 07:42.766
and it ended our friendship.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.857
- All right!
Let's go! Bring it in!

07:46.901 --> 07:49.381
- Well, maybe the God Account
has plans on fixing that.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.818
- What, by helping Derrick?

07:50.861 --> 07:52.297
I mean, the kid
doesn't even know Cal.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.517
- Actually, he does.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.301
Look.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.390
He's his coach.

07:58.434 --> 08:02.351
- Good work, guys.
Derrick, come over here.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.222
Y'all keep playing the way
y'all been playing this season,

08:04.266 --> 08:05.876
that championship is ours.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.921
All right?

08:16.365 --> 08:19.150
- Clearly the God Account is
trying to pull a two-for-one.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.804
Our Friend Suggestion
just so happens

08:20.848 --> 08:22.545
to be coached by your
former best friend?

08:22.589 --> 08:23.981
- Okay, I get it.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.549
Let's just focus
on Derrick, okay?

08:26.593 --> 08:27.724
- Okay.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.987
- Cal!
- See you, man.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.467
What are you doing here, Miles?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.383
- Um, I was just feeling
a little nostalgic

08:34.426 --> 08:36.820
after we ran into you,
so I thought I'd stop by.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.561
How long have you been
coaching here?

08:38.605 --> 08:40.345
- This is my second season,
but this year's squads

08:40.389 --> 08:42.260
are already the favorite
to win the state championship.

08:42.304 --> 08:45.394
- Well, your pitcher seems to
be drawing a lot of attention.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.178
- Yeah, Derrick Gomez,

08:47.222 --> 08:49.137
best high school arm
I've seen since me.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.531
Derrick!
Come over here a second.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.795
I want you to meet Miles Finer.
- Hey.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.187
- Hey.
- How's it going?

08:56.231 --> 08:57.667
- And Cara Bloom.
- Nice to meet you.

08:57.711 --> 08:58.668
- One hell of an arm
you got there, man.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.104
- Thank you.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.628
- That's a high compliment
coming from Miles.

09:01.671 --> 09:02.846
He was my catcher in high
school, never met anyone

09:02.890 --> 09:04.892
who called a better game
than him.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.416
Not that we always agreed.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.897
- Is Coach
as good as he claims?

09:09.940 --> 09:12.377
- I used to have to ice
my hand after every game.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.031
- That's right.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.250
- So have you thought
about what you're gonna do

09:15.293 --> 09:16.904
after high school?

09:16.947 --> 09:18.993
- Derrick has offers from
every college in the country.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.734
But he's narrowed it down
between Stanford,

09:20.777 --> 09:21.778
Arizona State,
and Florida.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.301
He's gonna announce on Friday.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.955
- Congratulations, man.
That's amazing.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.610
- Thank you. Couldn't have
done it without Coach.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.046
All right,
I gotta head to work.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.178
It was nice to meet you guys.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.921
- He's a Harlem Parochial
on scholarship.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.445
Mom runs a bakery in the Bronx.
It's just the two of them.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.273
Picks up hours
after school to help out.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.361
- Well, he seems
like a good kid.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.232
- He is.

09:41.276 --> 09:44.584
It was good seeing you, Miles.
We should catch up sometime.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.716
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Well, actually,

09:46.760 --> 09:48.675
Miles' sister
runs a really great bar

09:48.718 --> 09:50.372
called the Honeysuckle Rose.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.026
We were gonna go down there
and have drinks tonight.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.419
You should--you should come.
- Okay, sounds like fun.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.899
I'll see you there.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.858
- See ya.
- See ya.

10:01.296 --> 10:04.255
- What? Look, is catching up
with an old friend

10:04.299 --> 10:05.779
really the end of the world?

10:05.822 --> 10:07.389
Besides, he's Derrick's coach.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.043
He probably knows
what's going on in his life.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.436
- True, except Derrick
doesn't look like

10:11.480 --> 10:13.003
he needs any help
with baseball.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.309
- Yeah, so where
does that leave us?

10:14.352 --> 10:16.050
- Maybe the problem's
closer to home.

10:16.093 --> 10:18.792
Cal said that his mom
runs a bakery.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.271
Let's go talk to her.

10:20.315 --> 10:23.013
- So just take a look
and let me know

10:23.057 --> 10:24.624
if you have any questions.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.281
So, guys, how's the, uh--

10:30.325 --> 10:31.718
how's the data analytics
coming along?

10:31.761 --> 10:34.503
- Oh-ho!
- That's a kill shot.

10:34.546 --> 10:37.941
- Okay, you're playing video
games, not working at all.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.204
Um...

10:40.248 --> 10:43.643
Hey, guys, I just--if y'all
would listen for one second,

10:43.686 --> 10:45.035
I just want to get something
off my chest real quick.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.995
I, uh--I've been picking up
this vibe

10:48.038 --> 10:50.345
that you guys hate me and--

10:50.388 --> 10:51.607
- Oh, we don't hate you.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.000
- Okay.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.742
- We're just not gonna
work for you.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.135
- What?
- That's right.

10:58.179 --> 11:01.748
Instead, we're gonna sit back
and watch you fail.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.752
- Why?
- I been in IT for eight years.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.276
That promotion
should have been mine.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.408
Everyone agrees.
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.497
- Look, guys, I'm sorry, but if
you're not gonna work for me,

11:12.541 --> 11:13.760
I'm just gonna
have to let you go.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.588
- Mm, wrong again.
I checked.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.286
You don't have the power
to fire anyone

11:18.329 --> 11:22.246
inside the IT department,
which is...all of us.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.074
- I don't?
- No.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.076
What you can do
is report your team's

11:26.120 --> 11:28.688
total lack of progress
on your weekly TPR report.

11:28.731 --> 11:31.778
And when you do, who do you
think they're gonna blame?

11:31.821 --> 11:34.737
A team of IT professionals

11:34.781 --> 11:38.132
or the headset
from customer service?

11:41.265 --> 11:44.007
- So anything else from your
high school experience

11:44.051 --> 11:45.095
you want to share?

11:45.139 --> 11:46.880
Prom date? Yearbook quote?

11:46.923 --> 11:51.754
- Oh, uh, Brandy King
and...

11:51.798 --> 11:54.539
"To protect the sheep,
you gotta catch the wolf,

11:54.583 --> 11:57.238
and it takes a wolf
to catch a wolf."

11:57.281 --> 12:00.241
- Hmm, the Bible?
- Denzel, "Training Day."

12:00.284 --> 12:03.418
What about you?
- Um...

12:03.461 --> 12:05.855
Kenny Woodruff and,

12:05.899 --> 12:09.250
"The distance means nothing
if one has a motive."

12:09.293 --> 12:11.513
Jane Austen.

12:11.556 --> 12:15.169
- Wait, wait, wait.
Is that Derrick?

12:15.212 --> 12:17.911
- Yeah.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.000
- Uh, look at
the license plate. GCM.

12:20.043 --> 12:23.481
That is a sports agency.
They rep a few of the Yankees.

12:23.525 --> 12:24.787
- If Derrick's going
to college,

12:24.831 --> 12:26.702
why would he need an agent?

12:26.746 --> 12:27.877
- He wouldn't.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.536
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:34.579 --> 12:35.537
- What are you two doing here?

12:35.580 --> 12:37.582
- Uh, Cal mentioned

12:37.626 --> 12:39.671
that you worked
at your mom's bakery,

12:39.715 --> 12:42.500
and Cara is always on the
lookout for a good dessert.

12:42.544 --> 12:43.806
- Guilty as charged.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.286
- Well, you guys came
to the right place.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.330
Come on in.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.643
- Where have you been?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.036
You took out the trash
20 minutes ago.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.777
- I was talking to Candace.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.040
- You can talk to your
girlfriend on your own time.

13:00.083 --> 13:03.043
- Okay, Ma.
These are friends of Coach.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.479
- Nice to meet you.

13:04.522 --> 13:05.785
- All right, well,
I gotta head out.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.221
I gotta study
for a test tomorrow.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.700
- Remember, no staying up
late tonight, okay?

13:08.744 --> 13:10.267
You need to open the shop
in the morning.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.878
- On it.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.880
It was good to see you guys.
- Mm-hmm.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.798
- So you're friends with Cal.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.409
- Yes, we used to play ball
together in high school.

13:21.452 --> 13:24.281
- Um, so Cal mentioned
that Derrick was deciding

13:24.325 --> 13:25.761
between three colleges?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.198
- Yes, but his heart's set
on Stanford.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.505
He'll be the first in our
family to go to college.

13:30.548 --> 13:33.421
- Well, has he talked about
entering the draft?

13:33.464 --> 13:35.336
Maybe taking a shot
at the minors instead?

13:35.379 --> 13:38.382
- Of course, but he knows
how important college is.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.993
Cal's helped him
realize that dream.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.256
I don't know
what I'd do without him.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.693
Let me grab you
some tres leches.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.436
- If Derrick
is going to college,

13:48.479 --> 13:51.700
then why lie to his mom
about talking to an agent?

13:51.743 --> 13:53.528
- I don't know.

14:04.408 --> 14:07.629
- He did not.
- Oh, he did.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.849
He almost won the singing
talent show too.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.502
- Wait, what song did you sing?

14:11.546 --> 14:14.462
- Uh, "Get It On Tonite"
by Montell Jordan,

14:14.505 --> 14:16.551
but it was Cal's fault, okay?

14:16.594 --> 14:18.466
Victoria Grant
was swerving me all year

14:18.509 --> 14:19.902
and he said it would
get her attention.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.338
- Unfortunately it got

14:21.382 --> 14:22.731
Sister Margaret's
attention as well.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.559
Miles got detention
for two weeks.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.604
- Almost missed the last game
of the season.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.215
- Oh, I'm assuming
he told you we lost

14:28.258 --> 14:30.260
because I waved off his call
and threw my curve.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.306
- He might have mentioned it.
- Oh, yeah?

14:32.349 --> 14:34.438
Did he mention that I had been
throwing my fastball all game

14:34.482 --> 14:36.049
and could barely lift my arm?

14:36.092 --> 14:39.356
Not to mention,
the batter was waiting for it.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.184
- Winning that game
was my only chance

14:41.228 --> 14:43.447
to play at Yankee Stadium,
to know what it felt like

14:43.491 --> 14:45.275
to be on the same field
as Derek Jeter,

14:45.319 --> 14:47.974
Mariano Rivera, Alex Rodriguez.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.932
Not everyone was heading
to the show.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.368
- Yeah, well....

14:52.979 --> 14:54.458
- Miles said you got hurt?

14:54.502 --> 14:55.764
- Yeah, I tore my UCL
in the game

14:55.807 --> 14:57.940
against the Dayton Dragons.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.986
Only been on the Single-A
roster for a few months.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.813
- I'm sorry.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.859
- Hey, it's the risk of trying
to make it to the bigs.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.950
Thankfully I found my way back
to baseball through coaching.

15:07.994 --> 15:11.214
- Oh, we wanted to ask you
about Derrick.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.260
We stopped by
his mom's bakery earlier

15:13.303 --> 15:15.479
and saw him talking
to an agent from GCM.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.394
- Oh, man, they come around
all the time.

15:17.438 --> 15:20.223
He just humors them, you know?
To maintain the relationship.

15:20.267 --> 15:23.052
- So you're sure
it's nothing more?

15:23.096 --> 15:25.272
He lied to his mom about it.
- I mean, if he's thinking

15:25.315 --> 15:27.622
about declaring for the draft,
he might not tell you.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.406
- No, trust me, he would.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.886
Look, I appreciate
your concern,

15:30.930 --> 15:32.409
but Derrick's got
his priorities straight.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.459
I'm sorry, Derrick's--
his mom is calling me.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.986
Hey. Yeah.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.641
No, no, I'm glad you did.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.121
I'll take care of it.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.214
I'm sorry,
I gotta cut this short.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.259
- Is everything okay?

15:56.303 --> 15:58.566
- Well, apparently
Derrick snuck out.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.743
His mom said he posted
from some place called Aqua.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.005
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know that place.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.528
It's a club in Chelsea.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.182
- He's not old enough
to get into a club.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.184
If he gets arrested,
he could jeopardize everything.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.360
- Well, hey,
it's not too far from here.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.145
- You guys should go.
- Really?

16:12.188 --> 16:13.494
- Yeah.
- Let's go, man.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.148
- Club's a few blocks up.

16:15.191 --> 16:16.801
- Hey, don't get me wrong,
Miles,

16:16.845 --> 16:18.020
I appreciate you
coming with me,

16:18.064 --> 16:19.500
but I definitely put this
in the...

16:19.543 --> 16:21.023
above-and-beyond category.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.633
- Well, kinda been going
for some extra credit.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.071
Besides, I see how important
Derrick is to you.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.899
It's the least I can do.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.727
- Where was this levelheaded
guy in high school?

16:29.771 --> 16:32.252
- You sayin' I was opinionated?
- I mean, just a little.

16:33.688 --> 16:34.994
But seriously,
it seems like everything

16:35.037 --> 16:37.605
turned out exactly
how you hoped.

16:37.648 --> 16:40.260
- Yeah, well, about that,
I may have overstated

16:40.303 --> 16:42.697
how well my podcast is doing.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.135
I've actually been struggling
to find an audience.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.397
- Why didn't you tell me?

16:47.441 --> 16:48.442
- Well, man, because
it's always been

16:48.485 --> 16:50.705
a competition between us.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.228
- Yeah, I remember.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.711
- Look, what I said back then

16:56.754 --> 16:58.321
about how you weren't ready
for the majors,

16:58.365 --> 17:01.368
I have regretted that
ever since.

17:01.411 --> 17:04.023
- I appreciate you saying so,

17:04.066 --> 17:06.242
but that's water
under the bridge, brother.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.469
You see him?

17:15.512 --> 17:16.905
- Yeah, yeah, over there.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.130
- Derrick.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.262
- Coach, hey.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.873
- What the hell
are you doing here?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.571
- I'm just chilling with
some friends. It's no big deal.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.355
- Oh, they must be some
really rich friends,

17:32.399 --> 17:34.401
'cause that's a $400 bottle
of tequila right there.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.011
- What's he doing here?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.839
- Look, you don't get
to ask the questions.

17:37.882 --> 17:41.408
How'd you pay for that?
- It's on the house.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.845
- Let's go. We're getting
out of here. Come on.

17:43.888 --> 17:47.414
- No.
- You don't get it.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.807
You're jeopardizing
everything you've worked for.

17:49.851 --> 17:53.159
Look, we've got a plan, right?
And this isn't part of it.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.508
- I'm sticking to the plan.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.075
I'm doing everything
we talked about.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.381
I just wanted to have some fun
with my friends.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.905
- And there's nothing wrong
with that, okay,

18:00.949 --> 18:02.603
but just not here.

18:02.646 --> 18:06.085
You get arrested, it will
cost you your scholarship.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.130
Don't throw
your future away on this.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.917
- Whatever.
I'm tired anyways.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.049
See you guys.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.795
- You think he'll be
all right?

18:20.838 --> 18:21.839
- Yeah, he's just blowing off
some steam.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.450
It'll be fine.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.974
I should call his mom,
let her know he's okay.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.194
Thanks again for everything.
- Hey, no problem.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.021
- See you, Miles.
- Mm-hmm.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.069
- Let me be the first
to welcome you

18:34.113 --> 18:35.766
to Harlem Episcopal,
Andrew.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.638
- Thank you.
- Take a seat.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.859
- Hey, I have to confess,
I'm an admirer.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.557
- What you've done here,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.254
I should be so blessed.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.735
- Well, I'm sure
one day, you will be.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.867
So tell me about yourself.

18:49.911 --> 18:53.480
- Well, my path to God
was a bit unorthodox.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.699
I was actually studying
at Harvard.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.788
- Harvard Divinity?
- Astrophysics.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.355
- Yeah.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.183
I was raised in the church
but never had any problem

19:01.227 --> 19:04.055
reconciling science
and faith...and still don't.

19:04.099 --> 19:07.276
- Okay, I'm intrigued.
What happened?

19:07.320 --> 19:10.323
- Something I'm surprised
doesn't happen more often.

19:10.366 --> 19:14.588
If you study the universe,
I mean, you really look at it,

19:14.631 --> 19:15.893
it's hard not to be humbled

19:15.937 --> 19:18.679
by the scope and beauty
of its design.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.333
Science can explain the how,

19:20.376 --> 19:23.205
but I started asking the bigger
question of why, and...

19:23.249 --> 19:26.426
the answer I found was both
simple and profound.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.689
- God.
- Yeah.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.952
Anyhow,
I can't wait to jump in.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.041
I feel like I have a lot
of ideas of how to address

19:33.084 --> 19:34.999
some of Harlem Episcopal's
current issues.

19:35.043 --> 19:37.915
-  And what issues
would those be?

19:37.959 --> 19:40.918
- Oh, I didn't
mean it like that.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.486
- No, please, it's okay.
I want to know.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.533
- Harlem Episcopal doesn't
utilize social media in the way

19:46.576 --> 19:48.361
a lot of other parishes
are starting to.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.101
- We have a Facebook page.

19:50.145 --> 19:52.321
- Yeah, but there are not
enough engagements on that page

19:52.365 --> 19:53.714
to attract new, young
parishioners

19:53.757 --> 19:55.716
who might not
find us otherwise.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.544
Not to mention we could stream
your sermons online

19:57.587 --> 19:59.241
and collect donations
through Venmo.

20:01.417 --> 20:05.073
Um, sorry, I'm getting ahead
of myself, aren't I?

20:05.116 --> 20:08.337
- Um, it's fine.

20:08.381 --> 20:11.122
I tell you what, um,

20:11.166 --> 20:13.864
why don't we start with a tour?
-  Yeah.

20:13.908 --> 20:16.780
- I thought Cal had everything
under control with Derek,

20:16.824 --> 20:18.739
but after last night,
I'm not so sure.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.220
- Probably just
cutting the kid some slack.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.265
We all done stupid stuff
in high school, right?

20:23.309 --> 20:26.355
- True, but if Derrick's
deciding to skip college

20:26.399 --> 20:28.879
and enter the draft,
Cal needs to know.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.534
- What's the big deal?
I mean, kid goes pro,

20:31.578 --> 20:33.928
he's got chance to pitch
at Yankee Stadium next year.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.104
That's--that's kind of amazing.

20:36.147 --> 20:40.891
- Rakesh, it's not like getting
drafted by the NFL or the NBA.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.632
He's not going
to Yankee Stadium.

20:42.676 --> 20:43.981
He's going to the minors,

20:44.025 --> 20:46.984
competing against
6,500 other guys

20:47.028 --> 20:48.812
who's trying to make it
to the bigs,

20:48.856 --> 20:51.598
most of which
never make it close.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.948
- Hmm. Which is why you think

20:53.991 --> 20:55.341
the God Account
sent us his name,

20:55.384 --> 20:57.778
'cause he might be making
the wrong choice.

20:57.821 --> 21:00.346
- Exactly. Look, Derrick's
making a huge announcement

21:00.389 --> 21:02.173
about his future tomorrow,
and if he's decided

21:02.217 --> 21:04.263
to enter the draft,
we don't have much time.

21:04.306 --> 21:07.266
- Oh, Rakesh,
could you do us a favor?

21:07.309 --> 21:12.793
The agent's license plate
was GCM023.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.708
Could you run it and see
if we can get a name?

21:14.751 --> 21:17.319
- Yeah, yes.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.281
Ow.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.327
- Uh, bro, you okay?
- Yeah.

21:25.371 --> 21:29.070
I had to pull an all-nighter
'cause my team is plotting

21:29.113 --> 21:32.900
a coup against me led by some
evil nerd king named Tom

21:32.943 --> 21:35.381
who's convinced everybody
not to lift a finger, so...

21:35.424 --> 21:38.471
- Right, but doing your entire
team's work is not sustainable.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.995
- Yeah, well, if I don't do
the work, I'm gonna get fired,

21:41.038 --> 21:45.434
so what choice do I have?
- You could change their minds.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.308
- How?
- Well, by showing them

21:49.351 --> 21:51.048
firsthand what
a brilliant coder you are.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.398
I mean, that's really
the only way

21:52.441 --> 21:54.748
you're ever gonna get them
to respect you.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.880
- Mm.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.578
Oh, okay, here we go.

21:58.621 --> 22:02.538
License plate is registered
to a Pete Garrity.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.281
Huh.
- What?

22:06.325 --> 22:08.370
- What was the name of the club
you found Derrick at?

22:08.414 --> 22:09.893
- Aqua, why?

22:09.937 --> 22:12.374
- 'Cause, according
to Pete's credit card,

22:12.418 --> 22:16.073
there's a charge
for $1,200 there last night.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.814
- Now we know who got him
in the club

22:17.858 --> 22:19.207
and paid for those drinks.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.643
- Mm-hmm.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.820
- You know there's only
four of us here tonight.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.693
I mean, I think
there's enough food for ten.

22:26.736 --> 22:28.825
- Actually, 12.
- What?

22:28.869 --> 22:31.350
- But leftovers
are the best part.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.003
- So, Dad,
how did your meeting

22:33.047 --> 22:35.136
with the new
assistant priest go?

22:35.179 --> 22:36.746
- Oh, fine.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.968
- Fine? Really?
- Yeah.

22:42.622 --> 22:45.189
- I got this.
- Good.

22:45.233 --> 22:48.410
Then I will see you guys
for dinner tonight.

22:48.454 --> 22:49.890
- Thanks.

22:51.979 --> 22:55.504
So I take it things
did not go fine.

22:56.766 --> 22:59.682
- He, um...

22:59.726 --> 23:02.424
I don't know,
he's got a lot of new ideas.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.862
- I see, and they don't quite
align with yours, is that it?

23:05.906 --> 23:08.169
- No, he said he wants
to bring Harlem Episcopal

23:08.212 --> 23:10.258
into the modern age,

23:10.301 --> 23:14.697
which really means he wants to
bring me into the modern age.

23:14.741 --> 23:17.439
- You have nothing
to worry about, Arthur.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.876
Your congregation reveres you.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.357
- I appreciate that,
but if the diocese feels

23:22.401 --> 23:24.098
that the time is right
for me to take on

23:24.141 --> 23:27.014
an assistant priest,
that might be their way

23:27.057 --> 23:28.798
of telling me
that life after the pulpit

23:28.842 --> 23:30.234
is closer than I think.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.541
- Is that so bad?

23:32.585 --> 23:34.456
I mean, certainly you must have

23:34.500 --> 23:36.763
thought about retirement
at some point.

23:36.806 --> 23:37.981
- Well, I have.
Of course I have.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.940
I just thought...

23:39.983 --> 23:42.682
It was still a few years away.

23:43.857 --> 23:47.948
- Arthur, you have plenty
of good years left

23:47.991 --> 23:49.732
to give to your church.

23:49.776 --> 23:53.606
And maybe this new priest
has come into your life

23:53.649 --> 23:55.434
to help make the most of them.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.696
- Mm.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.003
- So you guys wanted to talk
about Derrick.

24:00.047 --> 24:04.007
What's up?
- Look, I get it.

24:04.051 --> 24:07.315
You see a million-dollar arm
and you're ready to cash in.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.317
But you need to back off.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.362
- Is that so?
- He's going to college.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.539
That's what his mom wants,
and so does his coach.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.105
- Uh, I hate to break it
to you,

24:15.149 --> 24:16.890
but that's not
what Derrick wants.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.631
Trust me,
I'm not twisting his arm.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.676
I'm just helping him
realize his dream.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.548
- So he signed with you?
- Not yet.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.071
He turns 18 in a few weeks.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.681
Then he'll cross the Ts
and dot the Is.

24:25.725 --> 24:28.205
But he's gonna declare
for the draft tomorrow.

24:28.249 --> 24:30.469
- There is no way Cal
is gonna let that happen.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.559
-  You don't get it.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.822
Who do you think
introduced me to Derrick?

24:35.865 --> 24:38.085
Cal orchestrated
the whole thing.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.695
They're a package deal.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.958
Whatever team drafts the kid
is gonna hire him

24:42.002 --> 24:43.525
as a pitching coach
in their farm system.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.444
Give us a call if you guys want
tickets to one of their games.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.537
- Cal lied to us.
He's using Derrick

24:55.581 --> 24:58.758
to get himself a second
opportunity at the majors.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.654
- Nice drop on your curveball.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.221
-  Oh.

25:27.264 --> 25:29.397
Hey, man. What's up?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.834
- How fast you throwing
these days?

25:31.878 --> 25:34.228
- I don't know.
Just need to keep my skills up

25:34.271 --> 25:35.708
if I'm gonna be coaching
kids like Derrick.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.145
- You mean if you
keep coaching Derrick.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.888
I talked to Pete.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.759
He told me about the deal
you made.

25:43.803 --> 25:45.587
- That's none
of your business, Miles.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.763
- Does Derrick know you're
using him to leverage a job

25:47.807 --> 25:49.635
as an assistant coach
wherever he signs?

25:49.678 --> 25:51.071
- It was his idea.

25:51.114 --> 25:52.725
He wants me with him.
I'm not using anyone.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.074
- So then why lie to his mom
about it?

25:54.117 --> 25:55.466
She thinks
he's going to college.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.425
- 'Cause he knows how much
she wanted that.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.383
He's talking to her now,
letting her know his decision.

25:59.427 --> 26:02.256
- His decision or yours?

26:05.955 --> 26:09.045
- You come all the way
down here to judge me, Miles?

26:09.089 --> 26:10.699
You don't know
what I been through,

26:10.743 --> 26:12.571
and you sure as hell don't know
what's best for Derrick.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.703
- Then explain it to me.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.445
Come on, explain it to me.
Explain how a 17-year-old kid

26:17.488 --> 26:20.622
bypassing a full-ride
college education

26:20.666 --> 26:23.799
to take his chances
in the minors

26:23.843 --> 26:25.932
is looking out for him?

26:25.975 --> 26:29.152
- Man, you haven't
changed at all.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.632
- What is that
supposed to mean?

26:30.676 --> 26:32.025
- You think you know
what's best for everyone.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.201
You always have.
- No, that is not true.

26:34.244 --> 26:35.637
- Really?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.291
You were supposed to be
my best friend,

26:37.334 --> 26:39.641
the one person who I trusted.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.513
But instead of having my back,
you told me I wasn't ready.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.298
- You said that didn't matter.
- It didn't matter?

26:44.341 --> 26:45.821
I was 18 years old.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.083
I had to carry that
around with me

26:47.127 --> 26:49.651
as I was trying
to take my shot.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.567
You have any idea what
that did to my confidence?

26:54.090 --> 26:55.526
- Wait a minute.

26:55.570 --> 26:58.529
The way you were
just throwing up there,

26:58.573 --> 27:02.490
you don't come back after
a torn UCL and pitch like that.

27:11.194 --> 27:12.979
You didn't get hurt, did you?

27:16.591 --> 27:18.071
- No.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.510
Turns out you were right.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.555
I wasn't ready.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.514
As soon as batters saw
my curve, they pounced.

27:26.557 --> 27:30.300
I lost my confidence
and washed out.

27:33.390 --> 27:37.220
- Look, I'm--I'm sorry, man.
I never wanted that.

27:38.526 --> 27:40.571
- This isn't where I was
supposed to end up, Miles.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.272
A high school coach?

27:45.315 --> 27:46.882
Back at my own damn
high school, no less,

27:46.926 --> 27:50.930
like none of my...
dreams even mattered.

27:52.061 --> 27:54.716
They did.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.327
They still do.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.460
I just needed
to adjust them a bit.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.900
- Hey, look, I get that.
I do.

28:04.944 --> 28:07.120
But what if Derrick winds up
paying the price?

28:07.163 --> 28:09.383
- He won't, because unlike me,
he's gonna have someone

28:09.426 --> 28:12.212
in his corner letting him know
he can make it,

28:12.255 --> 28:14.301
helping him do whatever
it takes to reach his dreams,

28:14.344 --> 28:15.650
reach the majors.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.392
Look, just stay away
from him, Miles.

28:18.435 --> 28:21.221
The last thing he needs
is your voice in his head.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.354
Believe me.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.841
- So rules are simple.
We pick a closed system.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.713
First one to hack into it
is the winner.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.584
Challenge accepted.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.804
But let's raise the stakes.

28:38.847 --> 28:41.067
Whoever loses quits.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.156
- You really don't want
to make that bet.

28:43.199 --> 28:45.636
- Actually, I really do.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.639
IdentitySeal recently upgraded
their network security.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.251
First one past the firewall?
- Sure.

28:51.294 --> 28:52.731
Just don't say
I didn't warn you.

28:52.774 --> 28:53.949
- Hmm.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.784
What are you doing?

29:02.828 --> 29:06.222
- Mm, just pacing myself.

29:06.266 --> 29:09.269
Ah, so let me guess,
you are gonna go

29:09.312 --> 29:12.272
for a brute-force attack
on the data packets.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.056
- Psh. Maybe.

29:14.100 --> 29:18.278
- See, now, I prefer to look
for a stack overflow exploit.

29:18.321 --> 29:21.934
That way, I can just
open a port,

29:21.977 --> 29:24.545
find a back door,

29:24.588 --> 29:29.028
and maybe even install
a man-in-the-middle app.

29:36.078 --> 29:39.603
- Whoa, how'd you
break through so quickly?

29:39.647 --> 29:41.954
- No way.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.831
I don't get it.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.747
You're just
a customer service rep.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.358
- I tried to tell you.

29:55.402 --> 29:58.753
Man, there's a reason
I got the job.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.842
You just weren't ready
to listen.

30:06.630 --> 30:09.808
- This is really great, Trish.
Usually Dad just orders in.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.505
- Hey!

30:11.548 --> 30:14.029
It takes a certain skill
to order the perfect takeout.

30:14.073 --> 30:15.552
- Mm.
- Like a phone?

30:18.599 --> 30:21.297
- So, Miles,
how's everything with you?

30:23.734 --> 30:24.779
- It's fine.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.174
- Fine? Really?

30:28.217 --> 30:30.045
Why do you Finer men insist

30:30.089 --> 30:31.742
on us having to drag
everything out of you?

30:31.786 --> 30:33.614
- She has a point.
What's going on?

30:36.008 --> 30:40.403
- It's just about
a Friend Suggestion.

30:41.143 --> 30:42.884
- Oh, the God Account?
- Hmm?

30:42.928 --> 30:45.669
- Your father and I listen
to your podcast every week.

30:45.713 --> 30:47.106
I love it.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.195
- I don't know about
every week, but continue.

30:49.238 --> 30:52.938
- Thank you.
Uh, do you remember Cal Davis?

30:52.981 --> 30:55.636
- Of course, fastball
like Roger Clemens,

30:55.679 --> 30:57.768
drafted by the Diamondbacks,
right?

30:57.812 --> 31:00.119
- Mm-hmm, and now he's coaching
for Harlem Parochial.

31:00.162 --> 31:01.947
- Uh-huh.
- Miles played catcher.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.426
He and Cal
were thick as thieves.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.515
- And now he's
your Friend Suggestion?

31:05.559 --> 31:07.169
- Oh, no, no, no,
one of his players.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.518
He's a pitcher.

31:08.562 --> 31:11.304
I think Cal is pushing him
to enter the draft.

31:11.347 --> 31:12.653
- And you don't think
he's good enough to make it?

31:12.696 --> 31:14.437
- I don't know.
All I know is, the God Account

31:14.481 --> 31:16.831
wouldn't have sent me his name
if it was the right decision.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.529
- So what does the God Account
know that you don't?

31:19.573 --> 31:24.143
- I have no idea, and I'm not
sure how I can find out.

31:25.318 --> 31:26.536
- I might.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.281
- Cryptic.

31:36.155 --> 31:39.593
- Oh, man, this is my old
catcher's mitt.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.116
I haven't seen this in years.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.423
- You always said that
to really judge a pitcher,

31:43.466 --> 31:44.815
you had to catch him,

31:44.859 --> 31:48.428
see him throw from the only
seat in the entire park

31:48.471 --> 31:51.170
that really mattered.
- Behind the plate.

31:51.213 --> 31:52.388
- Mm.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.175
- Thanks.

32:04.444 --> 32:07.055
- Looking good.
Make sure you ice up tonight.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.274
- Yup.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.975
- What are you doing here?
- Is Cal around?

32:14.019 --> 32:15.629
- No, he'll be back soon.

32:16.717 --> 32:17.761
- Mind if I catch for you?

32:17.805 --> 32:20.373
Sure you can handle it?

32:20.416 --> 32:22.810
I'll try my best.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.337
- All right, I'll ease you in
with my fastball.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.773
- All right.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.952

some of my stuff.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.867
- Grab your bag
and wait for me outside.

33:19.910 --> 33:22.043
I need to talk to Miles.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.441
- I told you
to stay away from him.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.834
- His changeup
isn't there yet.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.706
I haven't been behind
the plate in seven years,

33:32.749 --> 33:34.273
and even I
can see that.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.231
My guess is,
the scouts can too.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.972
- They did,
and they all agreed

33:38.016 --> 33:39.365
he could work it out
in the minors.

33:39.408 --> 33:41.193
- What, like you did?

33:41.236 --> 33:43.325
- Just listen.

33:43.369 --> 33:46.763
Imagine if you had went
to college,

33:46.807 --> 33:48.809
worked on your curve
without having the pressure

33:48.852 --> 33:50.289
of making it to the show.

33:50.332 --> 33:51.942
- This is different.
- How?

33:51.986 --> 33:55.250
- Because I'll be there making
sure nothing gets in his way,

33:55.294 --> 33:56.904
no one gets in his head.

33:59.559 --> 34:02.388
Derrick isn't ready yet,

34:02.431 --> 34:04.520
and you know it.

34:04.564 --> 34:07.393
He won't listen
to anyone else but you.

34:07.436 --> 34:09.308
And if you really care
about him,

34:09.351 --> 34:10.961
you would tell him
the truth.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.544
- So you think
you got through to Cal?

34:28.588 --> 34:31.112
- About to find out.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.688
- Pete's here.
- Yeah.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.299
- That can't be a good sign.

34:44.343 --> 34:45.735
What are you gonna do?

34:45.779 --> 34:48.129
- Derrick's
our Friend Suggestion.

34:48.173 --> 34:51.089
We can't let him make
the wrong decision.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.742
He needs to know the truth.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.226
Derrick.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.532
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.011
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

35:01.055 --> 35:04.798
- Miles, now's not a good time.
- No, I think it is.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.235
Derrick, you're not ready.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.369
Excuse me?
- What do you mean?

35:10.412 --> 35:12.849
- Your changeup
is nowhere close, okay?

35:12.893 --> 35:14.547
You go to the minors,
you're gonna get exposed.

35:14.590 --> 35:16.636
You go to college,
work things out,

35:16.679 --> 35:19.552
you'll get there.

35:19.595 --> 35:21.945
Different path, same end goal.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.512
- What do you know about it?

35:25.775 --> 35:27.299
- I had a friend once

35:27.342 --> 35:30.040
who was in the exact same
position you're in,

35:30.084 --> 35:33.174
and he thought I didn't
have his back, but I did.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.916
I wanted to see him go to the
majors more than anyone else.

35:35.959 --> 35:39.093
And I knew that if
I told him the truth,

35:39.137 --> 35:41.226
it would cost us
our friendship.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.055
- So what happened?

35:48.189 --> 35:50.757
- I didn't listen.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.933
And it did.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.330
Miles is right.

35:58.373 --> 35:59.766
You're not ready.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.202
- I lied to you.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.595
I never got hurt.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.205
I had a pitch that wasn't ready
for the majors.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.251
But I didn't want to admit it,
and I was willing to throw away

36:06.294 --> 36:09.210
a friendship
rather than face reality.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.344
Maybe if I had, things would
have turned out differently.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.613
Don't make the same mistake
I made.

36:29.883 --> 36:32.886
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, please, come in.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.409
Um,

36:34.453 --> 36:36.237
I spent last night
thinking about

36:36.281 --> 36:41.460
Matthew's Sermon on the Mount,
specifically the two roads.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.853
- I'm not following.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.681
- When I first came
to Harlem Episcopal,

36:45.725 --> 36:47.857
I had some big ideas.

36:47.901 --> 36:50.033
The reverend at the time,
Reverend Baldwin,

36:50.077 --> 36:51.470
was old-school.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.385
He liked to slip Latin in
whenever he could

36:53.428 --> 36:55.474
to keep people on their toes.

36:55.517 --> 36:59.347
Needless to say that he and I
did not see eye to eye

36:59.391 --> 37:01.306
on the direction
the church was taking.

37:01.349 --> 37:03.830
- I think I know
where this is going.

37:03.873 --> 37:07.486
I didn't mean to overstep.
- Neither did I back then.

37:07.529 --> 37:10.271
But I did, and I think it was
the right thing to do

37:10.315 --> 37:15.711
for the church, just like your
arrival and your ideas are.

37:15.755 --> 37:18.323
So either I can stick my head
in the proverbial sand

37:18.366 --> 37:22.065
and ignore my insecurities
and continue to run the church

37:22.109 --> 37:23.328
the way I always have,

37:23.371 --> 37:25.286
or I can take your arrival
as a sign

37:25.330 --> 37:28.637
that things need
to change around here,

37:28.681 --> 37:31.118
that I need to change.

37:33.816 --> 37:36.297
I could use a hand.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.603
- I'd be honored.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.872
- So just to recap.
- Mm-hmm.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.700
- You told a friend something
they weren't ready to hear,

37:47.743 --> 37:49.832
and in the end,
they came around?

37:49.876 --> 37:51.312
- You want me
to send my podcast

37:51.356 --> 37:52.487
to FreeVerse, don't you?

37:52.531 --> 37:55.055
- Whatever gave you that idea?

37:56.448 --> 37:58.754
- We all have moments

we still wonder about,
still question.

What would have happened
if I had done things different?

38:09.939 --> 38:14.117

in the moment,

38:14.161 --> 38:17.947

41:05.158 --> 41:06.507
Derrick would have made
the same mistake I did.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.857
- Look, Cal, I know how hard
it was for you to walk away

41:08.901 --> 41:09.945
at another shot
at the majors.

41:09.989 --> 41:11.033
- But it was the right thing.

41:11.077 --> 41:13.819
Plus, I got a state
a championship

41:13.862 --> 41:15.342
to deliver
to Harlem Parochial.

41:15.385 --> 41:18.084
- Your team makes it here,
I will be front row.

41:18.127 --> 41:21.217
- Actually, I can do you
one better, man.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.305
- What?

41:25.134 --> 41:27.093
Wait, so how did you
get us in here?

41:27.136 --> 41:29.095
- A friend of mine
has some pull with the team.

41:29.138 --> 41:30.618
- This is amazing.

41:30.662 --> 41:31.967
- You know.

41:33.926 --> 41:36.015
- Wait, wait, wait,
that is CC Sabathia.

41:36.058 --> 41:38.365
He's, like, one of the greatest
Yankee pitchers ever.

41:38.408 --> 41:39.714
- Yeah, he's not too bad.
What's up, boy?

41:39.758 --> 41:41.934
- How you doin', man?
- CC, I want you to meet

41:41.977 --> 41:43.762
Miles Finer,
one of my oldest friends.

41:43.805 --> 41:44.893
- 'Sup, Miles?
How you doin', man?

41:44.937 --> 41:47.548
- Oh, I'm great,
I'm a huge, huge, fan.

41:47.592 --> 41:49.550
I mean, you helped bring home
the title in '09.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.334
- Yeah, thanks, man.
It was a team effort, though.

41:51.378 --> 41:53.119
- Thanks for hooking us up, CC.
- Of course.

41:53.162 --> 41:56.252
- We won't be too long.
- No worries.

41:56.296 --> 41:58.037
Make sure y'all turn off
the lights when y'all leave.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.082
- All right.
- Yeah, gotcha.

42:00.779 --> 42:02.694
- They had the
Pinstripe Bowl here.

42:02.737 --> 42:04.609
Haven't converted the field
back to a diamond,

42:04.652 --> 42:05.827
so this will have to do.

42:05.871 --> 42:07.960
- For what?

42:08.003 --> 42:09.483
- You said you wanted to catch
in Yankee Stadium.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.878
- Don't play with me.
- I'm not playing, man.

42:12.921 --> 42:14.793
You ready?
Here we go.

42:14.836 --> 42:16.925
- ♪ Play it again

42:16.969 --> 42:20.842

42:20.886 --> 42:23.018
