You made that call in the
middle of our conversation.

02:37.582 --> 02:38.716
Did I?

02:38.784 --> 02:41.818
So I was asking, how's university?

02:41.885 --> 02:43.486
College?

02:43.554 --> 02:44.921
It... it was expensive.

02:44.988 --> 02:46.022
Wonderful.

02:46.089 --> 02:47.691
Okay, here's a list of your instructions

02:47.758 --> 02:49.359
for your Saturday with Oliver.

02:49.427 --> 02:51.894
Now Oliver can't have any soy products,

02:51.962 --> 02:54.831
so you know, when in doubt,
just go to Babbo or Nobu

02:54.898 --> 02:56.366
- or Momofuku.
- Yes.

02:56.434 --> 02:59.836
YOLO, FOMO, tippy-tee.

02:59.903 --> 03:02.138
(Chuckling) You are so funny.

03:02.206 --> 03:04.207
Oh, but Ilana, please...

03:04.274 --> 03:06.075
don't get him a slice again.

03:06.143 --> 03:07.176
Apologies.

03:07.244 --> 03:08.777
There's $300 on the counter.

03:08.846 --> 03:11.080
Let Oliver hold it, he needs to learn.

03:11.148 --> 03:13.850
Okay, bye, Ollie.

03:13.917 --> 03:15.184
Bye, mommy.

03:15.252 --> 03:17.854
I love you, you are my sweet treasure.

03:17.921 --> 03:19.222
I'm off to interview Desi Tutu

03:19.289 --> 03:21.457
and wax with Martha Plimpton.

03:21.524 --> 03:22.758
What a bad bitch.

03:22.826 --> 03:24.260
Ilana, look.

03:24.328 --> 03:27.829
Holy moly, that is increds!

03:27.897 --> 03:29.831
Good job, whew!

03:29.899 --> 03:32.033
So how are you?

03:32.101 --> 03:34.435
How "am" I?

03:34.503 --> 03:36.704
Good god, bwah.

03:36.772 --> 03:38.874
Last time I saw you,
you were a toothless spud

03:38.941 --> 03:40.242
sitting in your own poop.

03:40.309 --> 03:42.643
(Chuckling) I like when you babysit.

03:43.980 --> 03:44.946
(Ilana) Four Rs, my friend.

03:45.014 --> 03:47.515
Reduce, re-use, recycle, Rhianna!

03:47.583 --> 03:49.549
I'm sorry, ma'am, we can't reuse cups.

03:49.617 --> 03:51.118
It's a health code violation.

03:51.186 --> 03:52.253
Come on.

03:53.521 --> 03:55.389
This is so gross.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.893
Finally... Ab, Ab.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.027
Nice to meet you, Abbi.

04:00.095 --> 04:01.896
I've heard so much about you.

04:01.963 --> 04:03.297
What are you, on the campaign trail?

04:03.365 --> 04:04.865
Oliver, you're a child.

04:04.933 --> 04:06.966
Give her a full-bodied hug and mean it.

04:07.034 --> 04:08.034
Okay.

04:08.102 --> 04:10.736
- I mean it.
- I mean it too.

04:12.873 --> 04:14.073
Juice, my man.

04:14.141 --> 04:15.574
Stand guard.

04:16.976 --> 04:18.476
So, uh, this kid's parents know

04:18.545 --> 04:19.946
that you're watching him, right?

04:20.014 --> 04:21.180
Yes-uh.

04:21.248 --> 04:23.283
I'm doing more than "watching" him.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.683
I am molding him.

04:24.751 --> 04:27.520
Oliver is at a tipping
point right now, okay?

04:27.587 --> 04:29.855
If I didn't step in, he could go to Yale.

04:29.923 --> 04:33.125
And then Yale law and then kill a stripper

04:33.192 --> 04:34.359
and settle out of court.

04:34.428 --> 04:37.296
Jesus, Ilana, he's an innocent little boy.

04:38.465 --> 04:39.765
Yeah, for now...

04:39.833 --> 04:41.133
But if I don't do something,

04:41.200 --> 04:45.203
he could turn into another
useless rich old white man.

04:45.271 --> 04:46.739
Hm.

04:46.807 --> 04:48.106
Why am I here right now?

04:48.174 --> 04:50.708
Okay, all business, getting to it.

04:52.945 --> 04:54.512
Ilana, I'm not watching porn in here.

04:54.580 --> 04:57.315
First of all, everybody's
watching porn in here.

04:59.217 --> 05:01.052
Okay?

05:01.119 --> 05:02.153
You got it?

05:02.220 --> 05:05.523
Second of all, you need to trust me because

05:05.591 --> 05:09.093
you're about to experience
the best moment of your life.

05:09.161 --> 05:12.395
Okay, so I need to retrace
my porn steps first.

05:12.464 --> 05:15.065
I don't watch anything but solo porn

05:15.132 --> 05:16.366
because regular porn is like,

05:16.434 --> 05:20.637
"shut up, little girl, wash my feet!"

05:20.705 --> 05:23.740
And she's like, "uh,
don't tell my dad, okay?

05:23.808 --> 05:26.209
'Cause I'm just barely legal.

05:26.277 --> 05:31.281
I love shaved pubes and tan,
crispy bellies and tits."

05:31.349 --> 05:32.649
It's like, ugh.

05:32.717 --> 05:35.418
So I started with average-size penis jerk.

05:35.486 --> 05:38.554
- Of course.
- That led me to twins squirting, hello.

05:38.622 --> 05:42.125
Which then brought me to
frosted tips masturbation.

05:42.193 --> 05:44.627
(Sighing)

05:44.695 --> 05:47.030
Whoa, I just usually Google "porn".

05:47.098 --> 05:48.698
That's probably why I really, really

05:48.765 --> 05:50.100
don't like most of it.

05:50.167 --> 05:52.469
Um, I don't know, maybe you should just

05:52.536 --> 05:53.603
check your search history.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.937
Oh my god, uh-doi.

05:58.074 --> 05:59.041
Oh my god, get ready, bitch.

06:00.410 --> 06:01.676
- <i>(Moaning)
- (Chuckling)</i>

06:01.744 --> 06:03.712
Oh my god.

06:03.779 --> 06:05.414
Oh...

06:05.482 --> 06:06.848
My...

06:06.916 --> 06:08.083
God.

06:08.151 --> 06:09.584
Trey is in a porn!

06:09.652 --> 06:12.254
Kirk Steele?

06:12.322 --> 06:14.088
<i>Hold on, Ilana. (Bleep)</i>

06:14.156 --> 06:16.957
So before Trey was my
boss, he was a porn star?

06:17.026 --> 06:21.162
- So, so I'm taking orders from a porn star.
- (Laughing)

06:21.230 --> 06:22.963
I can't even believe this.

06:23.032 --> 06:24.065
What do I even do with this?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.799
I don't know what to do with this?

06:25.867 --> 06:28.636
Use it, bitch.

06:31.106 --> 06:31.972
Oh, yeah.

06:33.542 --> 06:34.575
(Humming)

06:34.643 --> 06:35.943
(Trey) Abbi?

06:36.011 --> 06:37.110
There you are.

06:37.178 --> 06:38.946
I'm always looking for you, I love it.

06:39.014 --> 06:42.349
(English accent) So there's a bloody
(Bleep) spill in the spin studio.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.752
(Chuckling) But really,
there's a bloody (Bleep) spill

06:44.819 --> 06:46.654
- in the spin studio.
- Oh, is there?

06:46.721 --> 06:48.589
- Next level, yeah.
- Oh.

06:50.425 --> 06:52.626
And?

06:52.694 --> 06:54.194
And I need you to clean it.

06:54.262 --> 06:57.830
Oh, I would, but I gotta
relax before I teach

06:57.898 --> 07:00.499
the 12:30 kick ass kettle bell class.

07:00.568 --> 07:02.101
What are you talking about right now?

07:02.169 --> 07:04.737
You know, I'm coming down
with something, I think.

07:04.805 --> 07:06.606
There's a lot of phlegm.

07:06.674 --> 07:08.374
(Clearing throat)

07:11.011 --> 07:12.912
Whoa, that is a lot of phlegm, isn't it?

07:12.980 --> 07:14.981
Abbi, that trick is for after hours, okay?

07:15.049 --> 07:17.617
Oh, is it...

07:17.685 --> 07:18.952
Kirk?

07:22.389 --> 07:23.722
Let's go to your office right now.

07:23.790 --> 07:25.091
I don't have an office.

07:25.158 --> 07:27.859
♪

07:27.927 --> 07:29.027
Get in.

07:31.598 --> 07:32.764
Trey, this isn't my office.

07:32.832 --> 07:34.333
Yeah, it is, all your stuff's in here.

07:34.491 --> 07:36.358
This is your snake and your cardigan.

07:36.426 --> 07:37.926
All right, you got your tweezer
and your tweezing mirror.

07:37.994 --> 07:39.228
No one else uses this.

07:39.296 --> 07:41.497
This is a picture of you and
your childhood pug, all right?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.767
Fine, it's my (Bleep) office.

07:45.835 --> 07:47.169
Abbi, when you said,

07:47.237 --> 07:49.871
"Kirk Steele: A man on a
mission, a (Bleep) mission",

07:49.939 --> 07:51.406
what did you mean?

07:51.473 --> 07:53.175
Well, I just said "Kirk",

07:53.242 --> 07:55.310
but you have now confirmed
that you are a porn star.

07:55.377 --> 07:57.345
Thank you for calling me a star.

07:57.413 --> 07:58.747
But Abbi, you can't tell anyone, all right?

07:58.815 --> 08:00.115
I'll get fired.

08:00.183 --> 08:01.817
Please, Abbi, you gotta swear.

08:03.552 --> 08:04.986
- What do you want, money?
- No.

08:05.054 --> 08:06.722
- I'll go down on you right now.
- No, what?

08:06.789 --> 08:08.123
No.

08:08.191 --> 08:11.593
I want to teach the 12:30
kick ass kettle bell class.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.161
We can start there. That's Gemma's class.

08:13.229 --> 08:14.362
I don't care.

08:14.430 --> 08:16.965
- Look, can't I just go down on you?
- No, stop it.

08:17.033 --> 08:19.400
I think it would be in
your best interest...

08:19.468 --> 08:20.401
Kirk.

08:21.904 --> 08:23.371
Yes, looking good.

08:23.439 --> 08:25.339
Whoo, my man, yes!

08:25.406 --> 08:26.440
All right, guys, what's up?

08:26.507 --> 08:27.574
My name is Abbi.

08:27.642 --> 08:29.210
I'm going to be your trainer today.

08:29.277 --> 08:30.044
This is a joke shirt.

08:30.112 --> 08:31.311
Cool.

08:31.379 --> 08:32.947
All right, I'm going to show
you guys how it's done first

08:33.014 --> 08:36.217
and remember, form is essential!

08:36.284 --> 08:37.150
Okay.

08:47.996 --> 08:49.397
Get back in your office.

08:50.832 --> 08:52.332
I don't know what just
happened with my body.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.168
It's like I literally have
zero upper body strength.

08:54.235 --> 08:55.469
Abbi...

08:55.537 --> 08:57.271
That mirror cost $1400
without installation.

08:57.338 --> 08:59.941
Okay, don't accidents happen
all the time in the gym?

09:00.008 --> 09:01.141
Can't the gym just pay for it?

09:01.209 --> 09:02.543
I can't report this to corporate, Abbi.

09:02.611 --> 09:03.978
You're not an authorized instructor.

09:04.046 --> 09:06.180
Okay, well, I'll just take the blame.

09:06.247 --> 09:07.782
I mean, I (Bleep) this up.

09:07.849 --> 09:09.483
Yeah, but I let you teach the class, Abbi.

09:09.551 --> 09:11.518
It's taken me four years to get where I am,

09:11.587 --> 09:13.087
but they're going to fire
me for this in a second.

09:13.154 --> 09:14.388
Please, Abbi, I have a kid.

09:14.456 --> 09:16.023
- What, you do?
- Probably!

09:16.091 --> 09:18.059
- I mean, a paternity suit could pop up at any time.
- Ugh, okay.

09:19.695 --> 09:20.595
What do we do?

09:20.662 --> 09:22.062
Okay.
