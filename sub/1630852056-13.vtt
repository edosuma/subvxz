00:00.066 --> 00:02.734
-This is your son?
-Yes, ma'am.

00:02.800 --> 00:04.367
You gave him a truck?

00:04.433 --> 00:06.300
I told him,
I would give him that truck,

00:06.367 --> 00:08.500
till you get a job,
get back and forth.

00:08.567 --> 00:10.667
I get a call saying
my truck had been abandoned

00:10.734 --> 00:11.734
on the side of the road.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.734
Is that the way it happened?

00:13.800 --> 00:15.967
Well, it's something
like that, ma'am.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.867
[Judy chuckles] Does it look--

00:17.934 --> 00:19.600
does it look like I believe him?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.367
[Kevin] Court, come to order.
All rise.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.767
Be seated, please.

00:52.834 --> 00:53.867
-[Kevin] Hello, Judge.
-Good morning.

00:53.934 --> 00:57.433
Case number 1045.
Stewart versus Stewart.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.567
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.233
Mr. Stewart, this is your son?

01:01.300 --> 01:02.333
Yes, ma'am.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.467
[Judy] How old is he?

01:03.533 --> 01:04.467
He's 32.

01:04.533 --> 01:05.900
[Judy] Your claim
is that he owes you

01:05.967 --> 01:07.667
certain parking fines,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.066
traffic tickets,
impound fees for a truck

01:11.133 --> 01:15.467
that you either gave him,
or he borrowed.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.767
What I gather
from your complaint is,

01:17.834 --> 01:20.934
you became aware that there was
a warrant outstanding

01:21.000 --> 01:22.166
for your son's arrest.

01:22.233 --> 01:23.333
Uh, yes, ma'am.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.967
[Judy] When did that occur?

01:25.033 --> 01:28.834
On the first of June of 2020,
uh, I had a City Marshal

01:28.900 --> 01:30.700
from the North Richland Hills
Police Department

01:30.767 --> 01:34.166
knock on my door looking
for my son, stating that--

01:34.233 --> 01:35.433
[Judy] Don't tell me what he said.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.367
Are you aware that there was
an outstanding warrant

01:38.433 --> 01:39.367
for your arrest, Mr. Stewart?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.367
Uh, not until that time.

01:41.433 --> 01:44.233
[Judy] Okay. Did you become aware,
subsequently,

01:44.300 --> 01:45.834
-what that warrant was for?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.066
What was it for?

01:47.133 --> 01:48.033
Traffic tickets.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.734
[Judy] What kind of traffic tickets?

01:49.800 --> 01:50.734
[James III] No insurance.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.433
No insurance on wha-- [chuckles],

01:53.500 --> 01:55.000
no insurance on what?

01:55.066 --> 01:57.633
On the previous vehicle.
Not the...

01:57.700 --> 02:00.667
on the previous vehicle
that I'd owned, uh...

02:00.734 --> 02:02.867
-[Judy] Okay. Okay, Mr. Stewart.
-This was a few years ago.

02:02.934 --> 02:07.133
So, you say that there
was a no-insurance ticket.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.066
-One or more than one?
-Just one.

02:09.133 --> 02:10.600
[Judy]
Now, I'd like you to tell me,

02:10.667 --> 02:12.800
since you say it was
a couple of years ago,

02:12.867 --> 02:13.800
I'd like you to tell me

02:13.867 --> 02:17.333
what the specific circumstances
were of no insurance,

02:17.400 --> 02:20.367
because, you know,
as a thinking person,

02:20.433 --> 02:24.100
I'm driving along,
and for no reason,

02:24.166 --> 02:27.367
a police car pulls me over and says,

02:27.433 --> 02:29.734
I'd like to see
your insurance card.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.166
Now, I've lived
seven-plus decades.

02:32.233 --> 02:33.166
[James III] Yes, ma'am.

02:33.233 --> 02:36.133
I've been driving
six-plus decades.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.233
That's never happened to me.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.600
Ever been pulled over
for an insurance card?

02:40.667 --> 02:42.367
No, ma'am.

02:42.433 --> 02:44.600
Ever been pulled over
for an insurance card?

02:44.667 --> 02:45.900
No.

02:45.967 --> 02:46.967
Kevin?

02:47.033 --> 02:49.367
No.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.600
Hundred years here
of driving.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.266
-[James III] Right.
-[Kevin chuckles]

02:53.333 --> 02:56.033
[Judy] So, you want to tell me
the circumstances how,

02:56.100 --> 02:58.600
somehow, your car
was pulled over

02:58.667 --> 03:00.500
for a lack of an insurance card?

03:00.567 --> 03:03.000
I didn't have my insurance card
on me at the time.

03:03.066 --> 03:05.633
And because I didn't have it, they,
um, I was cited for it.

03:05.700 --> 03:06.767
No, no, no, no.

03:06.834 --> 03:08.333
They pulled you over
for something.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.367
What did they pull you over for?

03:10.433 --> 03:12.033
Uh, I think at the time,
it was for--

03:12.100 --> 03:13.600
[Judy] No, no, think hard.

03:13.667 --> 03:14.967
The questions
are going to get harder.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.500
-[James III] Yes, ma'am.
-Mr. Stewart--

03:16.567 --> 03:18.433
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] I'm one of those people

03:18.500 --> 03:19.633
that you can't get over.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.000
-[James III] Yes, ma'am.
-Got it?

03:21.066 --> 03:21.900
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] All right.

03:21.967 --> 03:24.266
So, what were you
pulled over for?

03:24.333 --> 03:26.033
Not signaling at a red light.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.834
[Judy] Oh, well,
that's pretty benign.

03:27.900 --> 03:32.333
Not signaling on a red light.
Was that ticket dismissed?

03:32.400 --> 03:33.967
Uh, no, ma'am. It was not.

03:34.033 --> 03:36.967
Okay. Now, at the time
that you had no insurance,

03:37.033 --> 03:38.633
did you have a driver's license?

03:38.700 --> 03:39.767
Yes, ma'am.

03:39.834 --> 03:40.767
[Judy] A valid driver's license?

03:40.834 --> 03:41.767
Yes, ma'am.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.433
[Judy] Did you only get one ticket?

03:43.500 --> 03:45.200
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Just for the no insurance.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.834
[Judy] Did you subsequently
get insurance?

03:47.900 --> 03:49.166
Yes, ma'am.
After that, I did.

03:49.233 --> 03:50.734
[Judy] With what company?

03:50.800 --> 03:51.734
[James III] GEICO.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.834
[Judy] And what kind of car
was that?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.467
Uh, a 1997 Ford F150.

03:55.533 --> 03:58.333
Oh, that's the same year
of the-- the car.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.633
Does it look like
I'm having trouble with him?

04:01.700 --> 04:02.967
-[James II] Uh...
-I'm enjoying myself.

04:03.033 --> 04:06.166
Oh, okay. Okay.

04:06.233 --> 04:09.734
Now, that's the same year
and make of car

04:09.800 --> 04:12.300
that's in question.
So, you had a truck,

04:12.367 --> 04:14.633
just like your father
gave you before?

04:14.700 --> 04:15.734
Similar. Yes, ma'am.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.166
[Judy] Not similar, same year.

04:17.233 --> 04:18.800
Same year, same make.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.066
-[Judy] Same year--
-Same model.

04:20.133 --> 04:23.900
[Judy] Same make, same model.
What-- [laughs],

04:23.967 --> 04:27.900
Mr. Stewart, does it look--
does it look like I believe him?

04:27.967 --> 04:29.133
-Uh, no, ma'am.
-[Judy] Look at this.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.100
Does it look like I believe him?

04:31.166 --> 04:33.200
He's making it up
as he's going along.

04:33.266 --> 04:36.900
So, it's sort of joyous
for me to be able to do this.

04:36.967 --> 04:38.533
Oh, okay.
You're the judge,

04:38.600 --> 04:39.500
-yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] How many--

04:39.567 --> 04:41.734
Do you have a copy
of the warrant?

04:41.800 --> 04:42.900
Well, all I have here, Your Honor,

04:42.967 --> 04:45.734
is what the, is what
the City Marshal left me.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.166
May I see it, please?

04:50.333 --> 04:51.934
And he had, uh...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.500
Shh.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.400
Well, how much
was the total fine

04:58.467 --> 05:00.700
for this alleged
one ticket, sir?

05:00.767 --> 05:03.066
Uh, I think it was close
to 1,500 dollars, ma'am.

05:03.133 --> 05:06.633
In any event, now I know
with whom I'm dealing,

05:06.700 --> 05:07.533
I'm going to come back to you.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.800
So, this Marshal came to your door
looking for your son.

05:10.867 --> 05:12.300
Your son, at that time, according to you,

05:12.367 --> 05:13.767
wasn't living with you?

05:13.834 --> 05:15.233
-Correct.
-[Judy] But you were aware

05:15.300 --> 05:16.967
that this was not the first time

05:17.033 --> 05:19.233
the Marshals came looking for him.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.233
Uh, well, I was informed

05:21.300 --> 05:23.133
that he had already talked
to the Marshal,

05:23.200 --> 05:25.867
and he had made previous plans
to show up.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.133
[Judy] No, I'm talking about

05:27.200 --> 05:29.200
with regard to a total other matter.

05:29.266 --> 05:31.567
Did you ever have a warrant
issued for you, sir,

05:31.633 --> 05:33.300
for non-payment
of child support?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.467
Uh, no, ma'am.
that's not necessarily...

05:35.533 --> 05:36.533
What do you mean,
"not necessarily"?

05:36.600 --> 05:38.233
Well, there wasn't
a warrant issued for my arrest.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.233
Uh, I was in court
when I got arrested for it.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.166
[Judy] Okay.
So you were in court.

05:43.233 --> 05:45.967
What court were you in and when,
when you got arrested

05:46.033 --> 05:47.667
for non-payment
of child support?

05:47.734 --> 05:49.567
It was, uh, Family Court,

05:49.633 --> 05:54.633
and it was in 2019.
Uh, February 2019.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.233
Okay, now, somebody
came and arrested you

05:57.300 --> 05:58.767
while you were
in the courthouse?

05:58.834 --> 06:00.700
They actually made
a ruling right there,

06:00.767 --> 06:02.934
uh, and-and arrested me
as soon as they made the ruling.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.600
Oh, no, that-that wasn't
a warrant for your arrest, sir.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.100
The judge found that you were
in contempt of a court order.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.133
Yes, ma'am.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.867
That sounds more like it.
So, you went before a judge.

06:11.934 --> 06:14.367
The judge had given you time
to pay your child support.

06:14.433 --> 06:15.367
You did not.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.166
How many chances
did the judge give you

06:17.233 --> 06:18.600
to pay your child support?

06:18.667 --> 06:19.700
Not too many, Your Honor.

06:19.767 --> 06:22.734
[Judy] Not too many.
More than two, or less than two?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.033
Uh, less than two.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.266
[Judy] No, it didn't happen.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.967
You were told to pay
your child support,

06:27.033 --> 06:28.400
there's no question about that.

06:28.467 --> 06:30.300
Nobody arrests somebody
the second time

06:30.367 --> 06:32.667
they didn't pay
their child support.

06:32.734 --> 06:35.133
How many times
were you given a chance

06:35.200 --> 06:37.266
to start paying
your child support?

06:37.333 --> 06:39.333
I was actually battling
this for, it was a--

06:39.400 --> 06:43.200
it was a two-year deal that
I battled with my ex and, uh

06:43.266 --> 06:44.967
No, the judge had made--
not the battle with your ex.

06:45.033 --> 06:46.433
The judge had made an order.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.433
The judge had ruled that you're
supposed to pay this amount,

06:49.500 --> 06:51.133
either in permanent child support,

06:51.200 --> 06:53.667
or temporary child support.
You didn't pay it.

06:53.734 --> 06:55.367
Judge said, "I'm going to give
you another chance to pay it."

06:55.433 --> 06:57.266
I mean, I was in that court
for a quarter of a century.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.200
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] I know the routine.

06:59.266 --> 07:01.033
It's a pretty set routine.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.066
Said, come back,
pay the child support.

07:03.133 --> 07:04.900
You didn't come back,
pay the child support.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.567
-[Judy] You didn't--
-It was twice, Your Honor.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.567
Two times. The first time
they gave me a warning,

07:08.633 --> 07:09.900
the second time
they arrested me.

07:09.967 --> 07:13.333
Oh, okay.
Well, so you got fair warning.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.333
I guess you could say that.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.166
[Judy] Fair warning.
Okay. So, they arrested you.

07:16.233 --> 07:17.433
Did you spend time in jail?

07:17.500 --> 07:18.633
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] How much time?

07:18.700 --> 07:19.800
Seven months.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.734
[Judy]
You come from the State of--?

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
Texas.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.834
Texas. They don't fool around in Texas.

07:26.900 --> 07:27.967
-No, ma'am, they do not.
-[audience laughs]

07:28.033 --> 07:30.867
[theme music]

07:30.934 --> 07:33.200
'Cause what you're
asking me to believe

07:33.266 --> 07:35.734
is that you paid off
the 19,000 dollars

07:35.800 --> 07:37.700
in back child support.

07:37.767 --> 07:39.233
Take a deep breath,

07:39.300 --> 07:43.500
and say something
that we can understand.

07:48.033 --> 07:49.367
[theme music]

07:54.266 --> 07:56.734
[narrator] <i>James Stewart II</i>
<i>claims his son,</i>

07:56.800 --> 07:58.467
<i>James Stewart III,</i>

07:58.533 --> 08:01.500

<i>impound fees,</i>

08:04.867 --> 08:07.266
Now, how much
child support did you owe?

08:07.333 --> 08:09.600
Uh, a little under 19,000 dollars.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.266
[laughs]

08:12.333 --> 08:13.700
How old is the child?

08:13.767 --> 08:14.867
Uh, 14 now.

08:14.934 --> 08:17.200
[Judy] And what was the amount
of the child support order

08:17.266 --> 08:18.633
that you were supposed to pay?

08:18.700 --> 08:22.300
It was, uh, I had to make
weekly payments of 165 dollars,

08:22.367 --> 08:23.400
is what I think it was.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.667
Sounds like you didn't
make a few payments

08:25.734 --> 08:28.300
if your arrears were up to 19,000 dollars.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.533
Well, something like that, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.533
[Judy] Hmm-mm.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.800
[James III]
Over a period of three years,

08:32.867 --> 08:34.900
it's just missed payments periodically

08:34.967 --> 08:37.533
because of loss of job
or whatever reason.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.400
Do you still owe the 19,000?

08:39.467 --> 08:40.734
No, ma'am.

08:40.800 --> 08:41.767
[Judy] Did you pay it?

08:41.834 --> 08:42.800
Yes, ma'am.

08:42.867 --> 08:43.967
Over a two-year period?

08:44.033 --> 08:45.934
Over about two
and a half years. Yes, ma'am.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.400
[Judy] Anybody help you
make the payments?

08:47.467 --> 08:48.400
No, ma'am.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.433
Was this the first time
you spent time in jail?

08:50.500 --> 08:51.467
Yes, ma'am.

08:51.533 --> 08:52.867
Silly, right?

08:52.934 --> 08:53.900
Very.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.133
How much did you owe
on the parking tickets?

08:56.200 --> 08:57.166
Fifteen hundred?

08:57.233 --> 08:58.333
Uh, 1,500. Yes, ma'am.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.700
[Judy] Did you father call
and tell you

08:59.767 --> 09:01.233
that they were looking for you?

09:01.300 --> 09:02.300
[James III]
Yes, ma'am. He did.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.333
[Judy] And do you remember
what day he called you?

09:04.400 --> 09:05.700
Was it June 1st?

09:05.767 --> 09:08.266
Uh, it-it was around
the 1st of June. Yes, ma'am.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.266
Do you remember
the conversation

09:09.333 --> 09:10.600
that you had with your father?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.100
Uh, it was brief.

09:12.166 --> 09:13.467
Well, relay it to me.

09:13.533 --> 09:14.967
"Uh, son, they came here
looking for you

09:15.033 --> 09:17.567
for warrants.
You need to get on paying this."

09:17.633 --> 09:19.767
I then told him because
I was going through,

09:19.834 --> 09:23.033
uh, a divorce, my mother
had just passed away as well.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.300
I was also in between jobs,

09:24.367 --> 09:27.300
having just got out
from the child support thing.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.600
And I told him, "You know, I-I--
I'm going to get on this,

09:29.667 --> 09:32.367
but I can't pay it until
I get a job and get money."

09:32.433 --> 09:33.633
He then told me, uh,

09:33.700 --> 09:34.800
"Well, we need to get this
taken care of

09:34.867 --> 09:37.000
because I don't need them
coming by my house like this."

09:37.066 --> 09:38.033
And we went down there

09:38.100 --> 09:39.633
and-and he made
the initial payment.

09:39.700 --> 09:40.767
[Judy] And how much was that?

09:40.834 --> 09:42.367
Three hundred and
eighty-five dollars, I think.

09:42.433 --> 09:44.367
Excuse me, Judge.
I gave him 400.

09:44.433 --> 09:47.100
He never gave me back
my change though.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.734
-[chuckles]
-[audience chuckles]

09:48.800 --> 09:50.533
Well, that's your debt,
correct?

09:50.600 --> 09:51.567
Yes, ma'am.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.867
[Judy] Well, that still leaves
a lot of money.

09:52.934 --> 09:55.567
That still leaves
about 1,200 dollars.

09:55.633 --> 09:56.567
Yes, ma'am.

09:56.633 --> 09:57.667
Did you pay it?

09:57.734 --> 09:59.433
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Over a period of time.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.500
[Judy] Well, I want you to think
about the answer to that again.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.600
Did you pay the 1,200 dollars?

10:04.667 --> 10:05.834
Yes.

10:07.367 --> 10:08.800
Not all at once.

10:08.867 --> 10:11.800
[Judy] I don't mean all at once.
I mean all of it.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.900
I did, in payments, installments.
Yes, ma'am.

10:13.967 --> 10:16.066
That was the initial agreement
with the Marshal.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.667
I understand
what the agreement was.

10:17.734 --> 10:19.533
My question to you is,

10:19.600 --> 10:22.867
did you pay off
the 1,200 dollars?

10:22.934 --> 10:25.400
Be careful of your answer,
Mr. Stewart.

10:25.467 --> 10:26.767
Yes, ma'am. I did.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.734
[Judy] When was your last
payment, Mr. Stewart?

10:28.800 --> 10:29.867
[James III]
This had to have been

10:29.934 --> 10:31.800
about 12 months ago, ma'am.

10:31.867 --> 10:32.700
Almost a year.

10:32.767 --> 10:35.300
I actually had a, they actually
ended up picking me up too.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.500
And I had to sit the rest of it
out, all the-the rest.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.066
I didn't have the,
I didn't actually have to

10:39.133 --> 10:40.333
pay the entire 1,200 dollars.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.433
I had to sit out the rest
of what I didn't pay, in jail.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.000
What do you mean, you sat out?

10:44.066 --> 10:45.200
Sat in jail, ma'am.

10:45.266 --> 10:48.600
So, you didn't pay
the rest of the tickets?

10:48.667 --> 10:49.633
Well, they picked me up

10:49.700 --> 10:51.700
before I could make
my final payments. Yes, ma'am.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.266
[Judy] Final payments.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.867
And how much time did you
spend in jail this time?

10:55.934 --> 10:57.400
Uh, just a few days.

10:57.467 --> 11:00.266
[Judy] And that was for
contempt of a court order,

11:00.333 --> 11:04.133
because you agreed to make
that an order-- 385 down,

11:04.200 --> 11:06.066
and the rest
was supposed to be paid

11:06.133 --> 11:08.500
at a 192 dollars a month?

11:08.567 --> 11:09.467
Yes, ma'am.

11:09.533 --> 11:10.633
Well, you see
where I'm having trouble

11:10.700 --> 11:12.767
with-with your story.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.834
And then I'm going to get
to your father in a minute.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.700
Sad father. This all
happened a year ago

11:17.767 --> 11:19.934
when the Marshal
came to your house.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.900
You had just gotten
out of jail,

11:21.967 --> 11:23.400
which means
you didn't have a job.

11:23.467 --> 11:27.500
And somehow, somehow,
you're telling me

11:27.567 --> 11:32.667
that you managed to pay off
19,000 dollars

11:32.734 --> 11:36.233
in back child support
in the last year

11:36.300 --> 11:39.266
while you were not working,
according to you,

11:39.333 --> 11:41.934
and spent a little time incarcerated

11:42.000 --> 11:45.533
for not paying a hundred
and ninety-two dollars a month.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.533
So, is what you're
asking me to believe

11:48.600 --> 11:50.867
is that you paid off
the 19,000 dollars

11:50.934 --> 11:52.667
in back child support?

11:52.734 --> 11:53.667
[sighs]

11:53.734 --> 11:54.900
[Judy] Take a deep breath

11:54.967 --> 11:59.533
and say something that we,
over here, can understand.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.166
[James III]
Before the whole incident

12:01.233 --> 12:03.734
with me and him happened,
I did have a job.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.900
I was, there was,
there was a six-month time there

12:05.967 --> 12:08.066
where I got out and...

12:08.133 --> 12:10.000
Yeah, but you can't save
19,000 dollars

12:10.066 --> 12:11.600
-unless, you know...
-[James III] Well...

12:11.667 --> 12:12.800
...unless you hit it
really hot in the market.

12:12.867 --> 12:14.734
[laughs]
I understand that, ma'am.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.767
We also, I was also making payments
on top of payments

12:17.834 --> 12:19.900
to get the--
the back child support paid.

12:19.967 --> 12:21.800
But you can't pay off
19,000 dollars.

12:21.867 --> 12:22.900
I didn't have to
pay it all off, ma'am,

12:22.967 --> 12:23.934
because she waived--

12:24.000 --> 12:26.166
she waived what I didn't
pay off, because I'd spent

12:26.233 --> 12:27.367
the jail time
and-and everything,

12:27.433 --> 12:28.967
I'd been seven months in jail.

12:29.033 --> 12:30.700
[Judy] All right, Mr. Stewart, you're--

12:30.767 --> 12:31.700
Yes, ma'am.

12:31.767 --> 12:34.633
You know, you're probably
a loving parent,

12:34.700 --> 12:37.667
and you keep keeping
your fingers crossed

12:37.734 --> 12:40.000
and saying that
it'll all turn around.

12:40.066 --> 12:42.800
But it doesn't look to me
as if it's all turning around.

12:42.867 --> 12:46.367
Okay. Now, at the time
that he had

12:46.433 --> 12:49.700
three hundred and eighty-five dollars
paid down payment,

12:49.767 --> 12:53.233
and he didn't pay the rest
because he spent time in jail

12:53.300 --> 12:57.133
for not paying the rest off,
you also gave him a truck.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.533
Well, I-I told him

12:58.600 --> 13:02.300
that I will give you my--
an old Ford pickup truck '97.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.533
And that, uh, you
gotta have a horse in Texas.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.633
You gotta have a horse, period,

13:05.700 --> 13:07.633
if you want to get around
and survive in this world.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.900
And I told him
I would give him that truck to,

13:09.967 --> 13:12.700
uh, to, you know, get a job,
get back and forth.

13:12.767 --> 13:15.900
And he-he could have the truck, get a job,

13:15.967 --> 13:17.233
work three or four months.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.834
Save a little money,
and take that truck,

13:18.900 --> 13:20.667
some money, go get yourself
something better to drive.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.600
And, uh, that's what I did.
But when we showed up

13:23.667 --> 13:25.967
to pay the, uh, uh,
ticket to City Hall,

13:26.033 --> 13:28.767
my son conveniently
left his wallet at home.

13:28.834 --> 13:29.867
He told me, "Dad--"

13:29.934 --> 13:31.567
No, he owes you
the 385 dollars.

13:31.633 --> 13:32.667
There's no question about that.

13:32.734 --> 13:35.600
He understands that's his fine,
and he has to pay it.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.800
-[James II] Sure.
-We're talking about the truck.

13:37.867 --> 13:39.900
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Okay, so now--

13:39.967 --> 13:41.033
But I told him
he wasn't gonna leave--

13:41.100 --> 13:43.000
the truck was not
going to leave my yard

13:43.066 --> 13:46.000
until he got his-- until he paid
the payment or down payment,

13:46.066 --> 13:47.500
and he got that taken care of.

13:47.567 --> 13:48.500
Well, just a second.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.433
That's not what
you told him at all,

13:50.500 --> 13:52.166
because the truck
did leave your yard.

13:52.233 --> 13:55.433
And he did, in fact, have
the down payment made by you.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.600
And he didn't pay you back

13:56.667 --> 13:58.033
the 385 dollars.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.033
That is correct.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.433
[Judy] So, and you still
gave him the truck?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.100
Well, I gave him the truck
to go get the money

14:02.166 --> 14:04.000
because he promised me
he was going to bring it

14:04.066 --> 14:07.000
-back to me within the hour.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. You keep...

14:07.066 --> 14:09.967
Mr. Stewart, make sure
you're consistent

14:10.033 --> 14:12.500
with what you wrote
in your complaint.

14:12.567 --> 14:14.934
And so far,
you're not being consistent

14:15.000 --> 14:16.367
with what you wrote
in your complaint

14:16.433 --> 14:19.533
because your complaint says
that you gave him the car,

14:19.600 --> 14:21.867
and the condition was
that he get the car

14:21.934 --> 14:24.967
registered in his own name
and get insurance.

14:25.033 --> 14:25.967
That's what you said.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.500
Yes, ma'am. I sure did.
Yes, ma'am.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.533
Well, that's impossible

14:28.600 --> 14:30.734
because nobody's gonna
let him register a car

14:30.800 --> 14:32.767
with all those tickets
in his name--

14:32.834 --> 14:34.333
no state, not even Texas.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.000
And I realize that now, ma'am,
because,

14:36.066 --> 14:38.200
uh, three months later,
I get, uh, a call

14:38.266 --> 14:40.333
saying my car had been, uh,
my truck had been abandoned

14:40.400 --> 14:41.367
on the side of the road.

14:41.433 --> 14:43.300
[Judy] Well, just a second.
I understand that.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.467
Your truck's been abandoned
on the side of the road.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.834
It was still in your name, there were
impound fees that you paid...

14:48.900 --> 14:50.066
Yes, ma'am.

14:50.133 --> 14:53.433
[Judy] ...and certain toll fines
or other fines

14:53.500 --> 14:55.533
that were on the truck
when he had it.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.433
So, he had the truck
from June 2020...

14:58.500 --> 14:59.533
Yes, ma'am.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.834
[Judy] ...until what date did the
truck break down, Mr. Stewart?

15:02.900 --> 15:04.800
Uh, I believe
that was in July,

15:04.867 --> 15:06.066
at the end of July.
Yes, ma'am.

15:06.133 --> 15:08.333
-[Judy] July of 2020.
-That's not true.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.500
Now I'd like to see
the dates of the tickets.

15:10.567 --> 15:12.166
[James II] Well, I got the--

15:12.233 --> 15:13.734
No, no, let me just see it.

15:14.934 --> 15:15.867
[James II] Find it here.

15:15.934 --> 15:19.166
After he left in the truck
and did not come back, uh,

15:19.233 --> 15:21.300
I-I-I didn't hear or see him

15:21.367 --> 15:23.867
[Judy] Could I-- could I just
see the dates of the tickets?

15:23.934 --> 15:25.400
[James II] Well, I-I don't have
no tickets on the truck.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.300
All I have, I have the dates
on the-- on the,

15:27.367 --> 15:28.633
when the truck was impounded.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.200
No, when you--
you're suing for tickets

15:31.266 --> 15:32.600
that you allegedly paid.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.133
Well, I-I paid the down payment
for his payment plan,

15:35.200 --> 15:37.367
which he was supposed to
pay me back within the hour.

15:37.433 --> 15:38.900
-[Judy] Right.
-[James II] And he-he's the one

15:38.967 --> 15:40.867
that got the receipt
and the change.

15:40.934 --> 15:42.734
And I tried to get
a copy of that.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.967
But I did notify the Marshal.

15:44.033 --> 15:45.066
[Judy] Just a second.

15:45.133 --> 15:47.233
I just told you the 385 dollars

15:47.300 --> 15:50.834
in fines, he owes you.
You had other things.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.066
What you said was,
you had to go in,

15:54.133 --> 15:55.600
pay impound fees...

15:55.667 --> 15:56.700
Yes, ma'am.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.734
You got somebody
to tow it out of impound,

15:58.800 --> 16:00.266
and then you gave it
back to him.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.066
Well, I, you see,
well, I took it home

16:02.133 --> 16:05.000
and it sat in my backyard
for another six weeks.

16:05.066 --> 16:06.433
And he called me
on the phone saying,

16:06.500 --> 16:07.667
"I'm gonna come
and get my truck."

16:07.734 --> 16:09.867
I said, "No, you're not going
to come and get the truck

16:09.934 --> 16:11.967
because, uh, first of all,
it's not out of my name,

16:12.033 --> 16:15.233
and it needs a water pump.
So, it wasn't goin' anywhere."

16:15.300 --> 16:18.567
So, but he did show up
a few days following that

16:18.633 --> 16:21.000
with a water pump,
and he repaired it himself,

16:21.066 --> 16:22.967
which was,
I was quite impressed,

16:23.033 --> 16:26.133
which [clears throat],
thank God for YouTube.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.100
And I told him, before
that truck leaves my yard,

16:28.166 --> 16:30.033
I'm gonna see insurance on him,
which he did.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.066
He showed me proof of insurance

16:31.133 --> 16:33.667
where he paid through GEICO,
I believe it was,

16:33.734 --> 16:36.367
and he was on his way
down to the courthouse

16:36.433 --> 16:38.867
to have it transferred
out of my name into his name,

16:38.934 --> 16:41.633
which never happened.
There again, I-I trusted him

16:41.700 --> 16:42.734
and wanted to believe him

16:42.800 --> 16:44.967
-and-and, uh--
-[chuckles] Okay.

16:45.033 --> 16:47.934
[theme music]

16:48.000 --> 16:50.934
They sent you a first notice,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.266
-a second notice, a third notice...
-Yes, ma'am.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.533
before it gets up to 800 dollars.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.033
-Yes, ma'am.
-Well, why didn't you pay it?

17:17.767 --> 17:19.767

17:19.834 --> 17:22.367
Now, fool me once,

17:22.433 --> 17:24.200
Fool me twice, shame on me.

17:24.266 --> 17:25.300
Yes, ma'am.

17:25.367 --> 17:26.633
[Judy] And when you deal
with children,

17:26.700 --> 17:29.900
sometimes it's twice,
three times, four times,

17:29.967 --> 17:30.900
five times, you know,

17:30.967 --> 17:33.367
you-you keep hoping for miracles.

17:33.433 --> 17:36.700
Right now, your son owes you
385 dollars, period.

17:36.767 --> 17:41.266
And his responsibility,
so far, you've had zero

17:41.333 --> 17:43.934
except the fact
that he was able to

17:44.000 --> 17:45.433
put in a water pump
with YouTube,

17:45.500 --> 17:48.667
you've had zero luck
with his responsibility.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.166
Yes, ma'am.
That's correct.

17:50.233 --> 17:52.800
Okay, so far,
he owes you 385 dollars.

17:52.867 --> 17:53.800
Anything else?

17:53.867 --> 17:54.800
[James II]
Oh, yes, ma'am.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.867
When I went to get the truck
outta impound, I, uh,

17:57.934 --> 18:00.967
it cost me, uh, which
I have it here right here.

18:01.033 --> 18:02.266
Here is the impound,
what it cost

18:02.333 --> 18:04.633
to get it out of the impound
and here's what I paid to,

18:04.700 --> 18:07.767
uh, to rent a trailer. Do you--?

18:07.834 --> 18:10.567
And-and, and also at the time
that I went and got it,

18:10.633 --> 18:13.867
I-I-I had a broken ankle,
and I was in a cast on foot.

18:13.934 --> 18:15.800
So, I had to pay somebody
to go with me

18:15.867 --> 18:17.834
to help me
to retrieve the truck,

18:17.900 --> 18:20.000
get it on the trailer,
and bring it back to Fort Worth.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.300
Why did you do that?

18:21.367 --> 18:22.633
-[James II] Well--
-It wasn't running.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.000
Well, I just felt
like I was ob--

18:24.066 --> 18:25.300
it was still in my name,
so I felt like

18:25.367 --> 18:27.000
I was obligated
to do that, ma'am.

18:27.066 --> 18:28.934
Well, what you have to do is,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.533
you had to pay the impound fees
and then tell them to junk it.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.433
[James II] Well, I--

18:32.500 --> 18:33.900
[Judy] Unless you wanted
to give it to him.

18:33.967 --> 18:34.900
-Well, I-- I-I thought--
-[Judy] Which you did.

18:34.967 --> 18:36.000
when I take it back home,
he would,

18:36.066 --> 18:37.867
he can fix it
and realize that, you know,

18:37.934 --> 18:39.934
life goes on
when you have, when you,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.900
when you stumble in life,
and, uh--

18:41.967 --> 18:43.200
Yeah, that's what--

18:43.266 --> 18:45.567
that's what you chose to do
as a father.

18:45.633 --> 18:48.000
He owes you 385 dollars.

18:48.066 --> 18:49.900
[James II] When, uh, I got
another matter here, ma'am,

18:49.967 --> 18:53.734
to where he-he went--
while he was driving,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.433
he was-he was using
the toll roads. And instead of--

18:56.500 --> 18:58.133
That I would like to see.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.800
If he, during the time
that he had the truck,

19:01.867 --> 19:03.700
if he used tolls

19:03.767 --> 19:05.767
-or had any fines...
-[James II] I have the receipt.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.667
...that I would-- that I'll see.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.166
And I'm really not--

19:11.233 --> 19:14.266
I don't understand the,
uh, the yellow letter there.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.033
Uh, if I'm being sued or not, that's--

19:17.100 --> 19:19.600
I'm not quite clear on that.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.033
I just received, I didn't--
What address

19:21.100 --> 19:23.000
do you live at, Mr. Stewart?

19:23.066 --> 19:26.600
Right now, it's,
uh... Thistle Park Drive,

19:26.667 --> 19:27.667
and that's in Fort Worth.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.800
And what about you, sir?
Where do you live?

19:29.867 --> 19:32.300
I live at... Smithville Road.

19:32.367 --> 19:35.867
Well, I don't know
when these fines were from, sir.

19:35.934 --> 19:37.266
[James II] Well, ma'am, uh--

19:37.333 --> 19:39.266
It doesn't say.
It just says that there's

19:39.333 --> 19:43.600
a previous balance
of 768.91 dollars

19:43.667 --> 19:47.934
that had not been paid,
payment due August of 2021.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.667
If you have any dates there that--

19:50.734 --> 19:53.066
Yes, ma'am, uh,
I think these are those.

19:53.133 --> 19:56.367
That indicate when
these tickets were from.

19:58.767 --> 20:00.900
I don't understand this,
Mr. Stewart.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.000
They sent you these bills

20:03.066 --> 20:06.700
because the notices
come to you at your address.

20:06.767 --> 20:08.467
-That's because--
-[Judy] It indicates that

20:08.533 --> 20:11.567
they sent you a first notice,

20:11.633 --> 20:14.233
a second notice,
a third notice.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.233
Yes, ma'am.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.767
A first, second and third,
and it all came to you,

20:17.834 --> 20:18.834
didn't come to him.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.633
Well, he-he,
when he first got out of jail,

20:20.700 --> 20:22.900
ma'am, he had given my address
as his home address.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.834
Well, I understand that, sir.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.800
But-but-but yes, ma'am,
they did come to me

20:26.867 --> 20:28.567
because the truck
was still in my name.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.266
That's how,
that I understand.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.433
So, when you got
the first notice

20:32.500 --> 20:35.066
they send you notices,
you know,

20:35.133 --> 20:37.967
before it gets up
to 800 dollars.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.600
The first notice
that they sent you

20:39.667 --> 20:41.233
was 43 dollars,

20:41.300 --> 20:44.400
and a ten-dollar penalty
for late fees.

20:44.467 --> 20:47.800
And then they sent you
a second notice the next month,

20:47.867 --> 20:51.266
and then the late fee on that
was 25 dollars.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.033
Yes, ma'am.
Well, why didn't you pay it?

20:54.100 --> 20:55.433
Or contact him?

20:55.500 --> 20:57.700
So, you weren't surprised
when you got this

20:57.767 --> 21:00.800
for 783 dollars 'cause
you'd been getting them all along.

21:00.867 --> 21:02.967
Well, I tried
to contact him to tell him,

21:03.033 --> 21:05.233
"Look, keep the truck
off the tollway."

21:05.300 --> 21:06.900
[chuckles] Okay.

21:06.967 --> 21:10.367
Mr. Stewart, at a certain point,
fool me once...

21:10.433 --> 21:12.033
-Right.
-Shame on you.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.166
-[James II] Right.
-Fool me twice...

21:13.233 --> 21:14.433
-[James II] Shame on me.
-Shame on me.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.567
Third time, fourth time,
fifth time, six time,

21:16.633 --> 21:18.633
up to 800 dollars.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.333
At some point,
it becomes your burden.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.166
He owes you 385 dollars

21:23.233 --> 21:28.400
because that's his fine for
making a turn allegedly with--

21:28.467 --> 21:31.734
allegedly, without
an insurance card.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.433
Judgment for the plaintiff
in the amount of 385 dollars.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.367
We're finished here.
Thank you.

21:36.433 --> 21:38.100
-[Kevin] Court adjourned.
-Thank you, Judge.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.033
[theme music]

21:40.100 --> 21:41.233
I felt like I would,

21:41.300 --> 21:42.233
I would love
to get-get the truck out.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.266
It was-- it was in my name.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.367
Well, I just don't believe that I,

21:44.433 --> 21:46.367
uh, I should be ordered
to pay something that,

21:46.433 --> 21:48.233
when it was given to me
out as a gift, you know,

21:48.300 --> 21:50.266
the kindness of your heart
from a father to son,

21:50.333 --> 21:51.266
that's just my opinion.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.467
And as far as the toll,
the-the tollway,

21:54.533 --> 21:56.633
I mean, James might have done
the freeway at the toll, right,

21:56.700 --> 21:59.000
okay, and, uh,
and I don't use toll roads.

21:59.066 --> 22:01.700
It all got blew
out of proportion, if you will.

22:01.767 --> 22:02.734
And here we are today.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.600
Well, you know what,
I-I-I hate that.

22:04.667 --> 22:08.000
Uh, all I have in this world
is my son and my daughter,

22:08.066 --> 22:10.000
you know, immediate family,
and, uh, and I hate it.

22:10.066 --> 22:11.000
If I did this for my daughters,

22:11.066 --> 22:12.467
I wouldn't expect them
to pay it back.

22:12.533 --> 22:13.467
But it is what it is.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.633
And-and I hope
the sooner he realizes that,

22:15.700 --> 22:18.200
you know, that life's full of
bumps and bruises,

22:18.266 --> 22:20.233
then the sooner he'll,
he'll get over his dilemma

22:20.300 --> 22:21.934
and, uh,
and he'll get on in life.

22:22.000 --> 22:22.934
Hopefully, we can move on

22:23.000 --> 22:25.200
and-and keep going
as a family, if we can.

22:25.266 --> 22:27.133
It is what it is.
But hopefully, we can.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.533
I can let it all go
because it's just money.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.233
But I was trying--
it's all about principle.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.133
Money's not everything, so...

22:33.200 --> 22:34.633
[Judy] So, the question
really is,

22:34.700 --> 22:37.800
you always keep your fingers
crossed with kids.

22:37.867 --> 22:41.033
And the child is always
your child, even when you're 32.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.533
But there comes a point,
I think, for every parent

22:43.600 --> 22:44.867
where they have to acknowledge

22:44.934 --> 22:48.266
that a child is not
really being responsible.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.767
So, here's my question,
how many chances do you think

22:50.834 --> 22:54.700
that your parents would give you
under that, those circumstances?

22:54.767 --> 22:57.633
I think the lack
of responsibility is a big one

22:57.700 --> 22:59.700
because I don't think
my parents would continue to

22:59.767 --> 23:04.500
give me more responsibilities
like a car, insurance, payments,

23:04.567 --> 23:08.800
after I've been clearly challenged
in the responsibility department.

23:08.867 --> 23:12.433
So, not as many times as
that plaintiff gave his son.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.567
You got a little latitude,

23:14.633 --> 23:17.467
you're little younger
than that man

23:17.533 --> 23:21.433
who has a grown child,
and clearly who's irresponsible.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.133
But I think at some point,
every parent has to be,

23:24.200 --> 23:26.800
aside from a loving parent,
they have to come to terms

23:26.867 --> 23:30.834
with the fact that they have
an irresponsible child,

23:30.900 --> 23:32.567
and if you keep feeding into it,

23:32.633 --> 23:36.600
the child is going to continue
to be irresponsible.

23:36.667 --> 23:38.333
I think that
that's the takeaway.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.266
Yeah.
Parents cannot be enablers.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.667
Right. That's the answer.
