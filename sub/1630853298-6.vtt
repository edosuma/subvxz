so he did it.

ancient history, Brother.

39:09.016 --> 39:10.784

39:10.850 --> 39:14.087
we, the Elders of Israel,

39:14.154 --> 39:17.958
pronounce a blessing
upon thy head.

39:18.024 --> 39:24.431
The Lord acknowledges you
as a chosen daughter of Zion,

39:24.497 --> 39:29.336
and you are hereby directed

39:29.402 --> 39:31.705
to not abandon thy husband.

39:31.772 --> 39:35.242
Heavenly Father calls you.

39:35.309 --> 39:37.778
Because of thy righteousness,

39:37.845 --> 39:41.348
thou hath been chosen
to shepherd the Lafferty family

39:41.415 --> 39:43.617

39:43.684 --> 39:47.621
Not only Allen--

39:51.157 --> 39:54.561

for you to accomplish

39:58.832 --> 40:02.002

Did you know that?

40:16.951 --> 40:19.720

that calling

40:19.786 --> 40:22.956

against Ron and Dan?

40:23.023 --> 40:24.224
You didn't ask her
what happened in that room

40:24.290 --> 40:25.525

40:28.863 --> 40:32.666
ALLEN: I stopped coming home
for dinner.

40:32.733 --> 40:36.637
I knew then, without a doubt,

40:36.704 --> 40:40.774
that our church
is built on lies.

40:42.342 --> 40:44.778
Lies upon lies.

40:44.844 --> 40:47.514
But I thought Brenda
would leave me

40:49.883 --> 40:53.019

You're free to go.

in the world I can talk to,

43:29.042 --> 43:31.445

on a collision course

43:31.511 --> 43:32.846
with Ron and Dan.

43:32.913 --> 43:34.481
BRENDA:
Dear Betty, Allen's brothers

43:34.548 --> 43:37.351
have their wives churning
butter and baking bread now,

43:37.417 --> 43:39.819
saying they defiled
their homes with store-bought,

43:39.886 --> 43:42.856
so I'm buying them all
Sara Lee and butter

43:42.923 --> 43:45.091
to remind them they don't have
to live like this.

43:45.158 --> 43:47.994
Because if Sam or Robin think
they might lose their wives,

43:48.061 --> 43:50.630
maybe they'll start
to see things clearly again.

43:50.697 --> 43:52.199
The church
even sent missionaries

43:52.266 --> 43:53.367
from Salt Lake to help.

43:53.434 --> 43:54.968
After all our sisters
have been through,

43:55.035 --> 43:56.603
I thought it'd be nice
if a couple hunks

43:56.669 --> 43:58.705
reminded them
of His true church.

43:58.772 --> 44:00.941
- Sister Lafferty,
the restored Gospel

44:01.007 --> 44:03.710
can reach any Gentile if
they're among the Lord's elect.

44:03.777 --> 44:05.378
It needs no bells and whistles.

44:05.445 --> 44:08.181
- Sure, um, but the people
you're going to be talking to

44:08.248 --> 44:10.050
aren't really Gentiles.

44:10.116 --> 44:11.485
They're Mormons

44:11.552 --> 44:13.687

obsolete practices

44:13.754 --> 44:15.489

wouldn't even think to do

44:15.555 --> 44:16.857

with the government.

44:21.996 --> 44:25.666
Maybe just invite our sisters
to embrace modern life.

44:25.732 --> 44:28.035
I mean, God wants us
to shop, right?

44:28.101 --> 44:30.003
- Capitalism is part
of Heavenly Father's plan

44:30.070 --> 44:33.206
to help the church prosper
in the latter days.

44:33.273 --> 44:34.508
- And He needs every one of us

44:34.574 --> 44:36.376
to build His kingdom on Earth,
doesn't He?

44:36.443 --> 44:38.512
- Uh, big gates move
on small hinges.

44:38.579 --> 44:40.380
- [laughs]
That's a good one.

44:40.447 --> 44:42.082
Okay, well,
here are their addresses.

Dan will see us, come in.
