WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:03.671
Lavon, I know you're freaking
out about me going to Dallas.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.506
How is this gonna work?
I know that it's hard,

00:05.539 --> 00:08.176
but if you really care about
her, you'll make it work.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.510
Ruby doesn't get
to swoop in and take him.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.811
We were in love once,

00:10.844 --> 00:12.380
and Lord help me,
I still think I am.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.515
To be honest with you,
there is only one girl

00:14.548 --> 00:15.849
that I want to
have a date with.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.785
WADE: Good old Tansy keeping
 Georgie Boy on his toes.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.553
They're dating.
They're what?

00:19.587 --> 00:21.522
George said that he was
going to start dating

00:21.555 --> 00:22.723
serious contenders.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.193
So, if two people don't have
much in common,

00:25.226 --> 00:27.161
they can't make it as a
couple? Why'd you even agree

00:27.195 --> 00:29.197
to this?
Why did you push
for it to happen?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.332
Maybe I wasn't happy being
a placeholder for George Tucker.

00:41.709 --> 00:45.179
* On the first day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me *

00:45.213 --> 00:48.449
* A partridge
in a pear tree... *

00:48.482 --> 00:49.817
What a magical time.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.286
It's like all is
right with the world.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.487
Kill me.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.723
Do it,
put me out of my misery.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.626
I know it's hard being
alone at the holidays,

00:58.659 --> 01:00.694
and what with Wade
breaking up with you.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.431
Whoa, whoa, Wade did not
break up with me,

01:03.464 --> 01:06.200
and I am so much happier
without him

01:06.234 --> 01:08.836
because now I can focus
on more important things

01:08.869 --> 01:10.638
like figuring out
how to redirect

01:10.671 --> 01:12.173
air traffic with my mind.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.442
Ah, your mother
arrives today.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.477
Yeah, why did I agree
to this visit?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.712
This is gonna be
the worst Christmas ever.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.614
Well, come on now, Big Z,
I mean, the holidays are

01:20.648 --> 01:23.884
a time for joy
and forgiveness.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.853
Maybe in your family,

01:25.886 --> 01:28.756
but in mine they are a time
for judgment and fear.

01:28.789 --> 01:29.890
My mother once spent

01:29.923 --> 01:33.494
an entire Rosh Hashanah dinner
criticizing my eyebrows.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.898
Question is, which will
she go after first--

01:37.931 --> 01:39.733
the fact that I still live
in Alabama

01:39.767 --> 01:40.468
or that I'm not
a practicing surgeon?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.603
* Five golden rings...
Oh,

01:42.636 --> 01:44.338
do not let her hear that.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.874
That will just remind her that
I don't have one golden ring.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.143
Lavon, promise to never
leave me alone with her.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.478
It's my only chance.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.745
Candace Hart
does not air

01:51.779 --> 01:53.547
dirty family laundry
in public.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.749
I-I wish I could, but I
got problems of my own.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.817
Ruby leaves next week,

01:56.850 --> 01:59.353
and we agreed to do this
whole long-distance thing

01:59.387 --> 02:01.522
if, after a year,
one of us moves,

02:01.555 --> 02:03.657
so I got to sell her
on coming back here

02:03.691 --> 02:05.226
or I could wind
up in Dallas,

02:05.259 --> 02:06.760
which is why I want to
spend the week showcasing

02:06.794 --> 02:07.795
the joys of BlueBell
at Christmastime.

02:07.828 --> 02:08.829
I mean, leave her

02:08.862 --> 02:11.499
with the best possible
memories of this place,

02:11.532 --> 02:14.402
but I got to judge the
gingerbread house contest,

02:14.435 --> 02:16.670
the Christmas
cookie contest,

02:16.704 --> 02:19.507
and the dress your dog up
like an angel pageant,

02:19.540 --> 02:20.574
and that's just today.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.243
Stop.

02:22.276 --> 02:25.279
Lavon, I have the solution
to both of our problems.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.547
My mother,
the born judger,

02:26.580 --> 02:28.649
will fill in for you,
which will give you plenty

02:28.682 --> 02:31.452
of time to make Ruby's last days
as perfect as possible.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.786
My mom will be too busy
criticizing cookies;

02:32.820 --> 02:34.522
she won't have time
to criticize me.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.524
That is a great plan.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.158
I'll make arrangements.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.461
No, please, plea--
that is,

02:40.494 --> 02:41.262
that's too many cookies, I...

02:41.295 --> 02:42.696
Please,

02:42.730 --> 02:43.864
if AnnaBeth and I win,
it'll be good press

02:43.897 --> 02:45.199
for the catering company.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.734
Just try the cinnamon jelly.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.671
Ah.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.673
Mmm, mmm, delicious.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.342
Okay, are you sure?
Yeah.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.709
That you don't prefer the
chocolate cherry thumbprints?

02:55.743 --> 02:57.411
Do you want to
try those again?
No, no, no, no.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.579
These, these, just,
just go with these.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.448
Okay.
(sighs)

03:00.481 --> 03:02.816
So, with Magnolia
and her choral group

03:02.850 --> 03:04.418
off terrorizing
Orlando's theme parks,

03:04.452 --> 03:06.887
it's just gonna be you
and me on Christmas Eve.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.788
Mm-hmm.
Now, perhaps

03:07.821 --> 03:09.723
you'd want to spend it
with someone else--

03:09.757 --> 03:11.825
maybe that,
that nice Walt

03:11.859 --> 03:13.694
from the picnic?
(sighs)

03:13.727 --> 03:17.431
Daddy, clearly I am no
expert in relationships,

03:17.465 --> 03:18.732
but I don't think that
asking Walt to join me

03:18.766 --> 03:19.833
for the holidays
after only two dates

03:19.867 --> 03:21.569
is such a good idea.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.970
Why are you trying
to push me out?

03:23.003 --> 03:25.439
No, I'm not, it's just
your first Christmas

03:25.473 --> 03:28.242
as a single lady,
and I know it can be hard.

03:28.276 --> 03:31.245
Oh, well, thank you
for worrying about me, Daddy,

03:31.279 --> 03:32.380
but we'll have a
blast Christmas Eve.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.981
You can try all my
new pie recipes.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.384
Pies?
It'll be so fun.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.485
(chuckles)

03:37.518 --> 03:40.888
Uh, I can hardly wait.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.627
Mmm, I'll talk to you
later, all right?

03:49.430 --> 03:52.232
Drive safe, okay?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.537
Doc, you need a hand with that?

03:56.570 --> 03:57.538
Nope.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.273
(grunts)

03:59.307 --> 04:00.874
(sighs)

04:00.908 --> 04:03.277
Well, okay, then.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.479
She seems like a real achiever.
(chuckles)

04:05.513 --> 04:07.648
What'd you expect,
I'd sit around pining for you?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.817
No, no, I'm not...

04:09.850 --> 04:11.352
I am happy.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.620
If that's the story you got
to tell yourself,

04:12.653 --> 04:14.488
that's fine.
I am...

04:14.522 --> 04:16.524
You are not... you
are infuriating.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.026
(sighs, clears throat)

04:19.059 --> 04:21.495
Just so you know, my mother
is arriving any minute.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.397
Is that why
you're throwing out

04:23.431 --> 04:24.832
a piece
of perfectly good furniture?

04:24.865 --> 04:27.701
Just, look, you know
how difficult she is,

04:27.735 --> 04:29.370
and the last
thing I need is

04:29.403 --> 04:30.938
for her to figure out that
you and I were ever...

04:30.971 --> 04:33.073
Don't you worry about it, Doc.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.544
As you can see, I, uh,
I barely remember myself.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.980
May I?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.482
I, I just love wicker.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.052
(Lavon sighs)

04:45.085 --> 04:46.053
Hey.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.388
Congratulations.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.789
(grunts)
Oh.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.790
Your mother
is now signed up

04:49.823 --> 04:52.526
to judge
all 22 yuletide events.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.827
That is great.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.529
Tonight I'll take her
to the Rammer Jammer

04:55.563 --> 04:58.332
and get Wally to tell her all
about the new sneeze guards

04:58.366 --> 04:59.199
on the salad
bar, and then

04:59.232 --> 05:00.434
tomorrow night is
the tree lighting

05:00.468 --> 05:02.803
in town square, so

05:02.836 --> 05:03.971
not a second for
us to be alone.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.673
(car door opens)
Christmas is saved.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.940
Yoo-hoo!

05:06.974 --> 05:08.108
Uh-oh, and here we go.

05:08.141 --> 05:08.842
Smiles on.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.379
Hi!

05:13.647 --> 05:14.748
ZOE:
Mom, it is so
good to see you.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.083
You remember Lavon.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.351
Who wouldn't?

05:17.385 --> 05:19.820
Four Pro Bowls,
two Super Bowls.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.490
You call me when you're ready
to get into broadcasting.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.691
I'll do that.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.893
You've redecorated.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.596
It's lovely.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.631
Still maintains
the original charm...

05:30.664 --> 05:32.566
(sniffs)
...and smell.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.567
(sighs)

05:33.601 --> 05:34.735
I am delighted

05:34.768 --> 05:35.836
to be here.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.571
So, shall we have some lunch?

05:37.605 --> 05:38.972
Oh, man, I wish I could,

05:39.006 --> 05:40.741
but sadly I have to
work this afternoon.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.110
I know, but some
amazing news--

05:43.143 --> 05:46.113
everyone here so respects
your illustrious career,

05:46.146 --> 05:47.981
they have asked
you to judge

05:48.015 --> 05:51.652
some of BlueBell's best
Christmas contests.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.720
Doesn't that sound fun?

05:52.753 --> 05:56.457
I so appreciate it,
but I have come all this way

05:56.490 --> 05:57.925
to be
with my baby girl,

05:57.958 --> 05:59.727
and I'm not going
to let her out of my sight.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.728
(chuckles)

06:00.761 --> 06:03.363
I'll just invite Ruby
to the contests with me.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.866
And I'll forward my mail
to Dallas. (chuckles)

06:09.937 --> 06:14.808
So, I want to hear all about
your life in BlueBell, but

06:14.842 --> 06:17.411
let's stop by a drugstore
and buy you a tweezer first.

06:17.445 --> 06:18.912
Uh...

06:18.946 --> 06:20.514
Just a little.
(chuckles)

06:25.953 --> 06:28.956
TANSY:
Yay, Wise Men, bring that
frankincense and myrrh.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.492
Go, Joseph, go, nicest ass

06:31.525 --> 06:32.760
in Bethlehem.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.696
Come on, I meant the donkey, but

06:35.729 --> 06:37.765
Joseph ain't too
shabby either.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.666
DASH:
George Tucker,

06:38.699 --> 06:39.933
Joseph of Nazareth

06:39.967 --> 06:41.769
would not be chuckling
at his girlfriend.

06:41.802 --> 06:42.970
Well, you know what?

06:43.003 --> 06:44.905
I bet Joseph
wouldn't do this either.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.907
Hey, baby.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.576
I am going to tell the reverend.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.778
Stop looking for lightning
where there isn't any, Dash.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.712
My shift's over, all right?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.180
Now-- oh, there is my savior
right there.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.181
Here.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.949
(sighs)

06:55.983 --> 06:58.085
Oh, you know that's gonna look
great on you, it really is.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.087
Brown is your color,
brings out your eyes.
Tansy.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.088
Let's go.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.223
Enjoy, everybody, yeah.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.992
(both chuckle)

07:05.025 --> 07:07.795
Hey, you kook, you almost
gave Dash an aneurysm.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.797
Nativity heckling is something
I do at the holidays.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.798
Deal with it.

07:10.831 --> 07:11.799
Dealt with.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.601
Hey, do you want
to go to the, uh,

07:13.634 --> 07:14.868
tree lighting
with me tomorrow?

07:14.902 --> 07:16.704
I'd love to go
to the tree lighting with you.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.872
I already got you
the best gift.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.476
Oh, well, I bet it can't
top the one I got you.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.210
(both chuckle)

07:23.243 --> 07:24.211
Yeah.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.879
What...?

07:28.582 --> 07:29.850
What the hell?

07:29.883 --> 07:32.486
Oh, my goodness gracious.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.721
That was in the
robe pocket?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.723
Yeah.
Do you know what that means?

07:35.756 --> 07:38.926
George Tucker is going
to propose to Tansy.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.095
We'd better
return that

07:42.129 --> 07:43.497
to him.

07:43.531 --> 07:47.601
Don't you worry, I'll do it.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.237
I'm getting used
to BlueBell.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.272
You know, I definitely made
the right decision staying.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.841
I am doing so great.

07:53.874 --> 07:54.875
You're sure?
Yeah.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.276
You're happy here?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.778
You don't find it small?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.913
Small?
It's cozy.

07:59.947 --> 08:00.914
GEORGE:
Oh, hey, Zoe.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.115
Hey, Dr. Hart.

08:02.149 --> 08:06.987
Oh, hey, George, Tansy,
this is my... mom.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.255
Oh, it's nice
to meet you.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.990
I heard an awful lot
about you.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.725
George, yeah, I've
heard about you, too.

08:11.759 --> 08:12.726
TANSY:
Merry Christmas.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.694
Yeah, happy holidays.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.297
(whispering):
That's George Tucker--

08:17.330 --> 08:19.199
the man you may or may
not be in love with?

08:19.232 --> 08:21.268
But I thought
George was marrying

08:21.301 --> 08:23.737
Dr. Breeland's
daughter Lemon.

08:23.771 --> 08:24.872
Who's Tansy?

08:24.905 --> 08:27.307
Tansy is short for Lemon.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.610
Those crazy Southern ways.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.278
But George and she are
still very happy together.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.280
Nothing happened to derail
that wedding, that's for sure.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.183
So what about you--
are you seeing anybody?

08:36.216 --> 08:39.019
Well, yeah, Mom, I have been
here for a year and a half.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.321
You know,
I've definitely dated.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.291
I was totally with this guy;
he was the best.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.726
He was from Mobile.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.629
His name was Mo.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.230
Mo from Mobile?

08:50.263 --> 08:51.231
Mm-hmm.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.099
What did he do?

08:52.132 --> 08:56.069
He works for NASA
on the new Mars Rover.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.204
You ever heard of it?

08:57.237 --> 08:59.072
Mars?
Uh, yes, dear.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.974
Uh, so what happened?

09:01.008 --> 09:03.043
You know, my practice
keeps me so busy,

09:03.076 --> 09:05.679
and he was so busy
exploring Mars.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.849
It was tough
with the time difference.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.183
Hmm, I would imagine so.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.985
Oh, look,

09:12.019 --> 09:13.787
there's that Wade.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.188
Oh, I do find
him amusing.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.658
Wade, hi.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.660
Hey there, Mrs. Hart.

09:19.693 --> 09:23.330
Zoe mentioned to me that
you might be coming to town.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.798
Nice shirt.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.834
Didn't I send you that
shirt as an ironic joke?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.837
Oh, no, no.
Yeah, she lent it to me.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.672
What? No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did

09:31.705 --> 09:33.206
when I painted your house.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.675
You painted
her house?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.276
That seems
awfully nice.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.344
It wasn't nice,

09:37.377 --> 09:40.347
it was a...
business arrangement.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.149
Yeah, I do odd jobs
around town,

09:42.182 --> 09:43.984
and Lavon paid me.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.218
I see.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.219
Well,

09:46.253 --> 09:47.220
good to see you.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.791
Doctor, I'll see you around.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.297
(car horn honks)

09:57.330 --> 09:59.633
(seagulls calling)

09:59.667 --> 10:01.735
(birds singing)

10:09.409 --> 10:10.711
Brick's off today.

10:10.744 --> 10:11.511
The office is
probably packed

10:11.544 --> 10:14.314
with pinkeye,
lice, you name it,

10:14.347 --> 10:17.117
contagious and possibly
flesh-eating diseases.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.251
Lord knows who paged.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.187
You are probably
safer going to tour

10:20.220 --> 10:21.421
some historic
homes instead.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.990
Oh, not on your life.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.624
I can't wait to see
all the action.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.061
It's the bunion again,
Dr. Hart.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.329
I called,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.865
but nobody answered.
Come on.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.133
CANDACE:
I'll just sit here

10:33.166 --> 10:34.735
and do some e-mail.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.169
I'll be here when you get out.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.038
Okay.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.808
*

10:40.841 --> 10:42.442
Ruby?
Mm-hmm?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.077
Merry Christmas.
Likewise.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.946
Though I don't know
how merry it could be.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.881
Poor thing-- being
alone at the holidays

10:47.915 --> 10:49.316
can really expose
the emptiness of one's life.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.151
Me? Oh.
(laughs)

10:51.184 --> 10:52.452
I'm fine and dandy.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.155
I'm dating someone,
actually. Walt.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.457
You may remember him--
he's the guy that chose me

10:57.490 --> 10:59.359
over you that
night at Torchy's.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.461
The dentist?
The orthodontist.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.797
Well, perhaps he can give you
a "free consultation"

11:03.831 --> 11:05.198
on that under-bite.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.433
You are just such a riot.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.035
I heard you took
that job in Dallas.

11:08.068 --> 11:08.969
That's such a shame

11:09.002 --> 11:11.371
because I will just miss
that sense of humor.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.240
Me and my sense of humor
will be around plenty.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.308
And I think that I speak for
most of the women in BlueBell

11:15.342 --> 11:19.813
when I say that we will be as
welcoming to you as always.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.815
DASH: BlueBell's
Christmas Cookie Champion

11:21.849 --> 11:23.717
is none other...

11:23.751 --> 11:25.318
than Lemon Breeland!

11:25.352 --> 11:29.089
(laughing):
Me?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.791
Well, merry, merry.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.993
LAVON:
Hey, Ruby.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.796
So, I don't have another contest
to judge for two hours.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.230
How about we enjoy

11:37.264 --> 11:40.467
the magic of Christmas
in our wonderful hometown?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.835
Ruby, you all right?
You know,

11:41.869 --> 11:42.970
the one good thing
about moving to Dallas

11:43.003 --> 11:46.206
is not having to run into
Lemon Breeland ever again.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.141
I just don't understand why
you're friends with her.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.078
Well, she just helped me
with my campaign, is all.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.712
It's not like we're close.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.486
(laughing)

11:59.519 --> 12:01.989
What's so funny?
I can't...

12:02.022 --> 12:03.824
I can't tell you.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.093
Oh, I really
can't tell you.

12:06.126 --> 12:10.097
Wanda, laughing at someone
is not nice and kind of scary.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.365
What? You're freaking me out!
Well, if it was me,

12:12.399 --> 12:15.368
I'd want to know so I could be
sure to get a manicure.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.970
(laughs)
But you can't

12:17.004 --> 12:18.872
tell George I told you.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.442
(whispering inaudibly)

12:22.475 --> 12:24.878
(squeals, laughs)

12:27.280 --> 12:28.849
We're all set.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.985
(pants)
Thanks, D-Dr. Hart.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.553
You okay, Hal?
Bunion got you down?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.455
Not the b-bunion,
it's my wife.

12:35.488 --> 12:39.026
She... she really wants
to go see our grandkids

12:39.059 --> 12:40.928
in Pascagoula
for the holidays,

12:40.961 --> 12:42.896
but I have to work.
That stinks.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.133
It does. I have worked
every Christmas Eve

12:46.166 --> 12:48.335
for the last 20 years.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.470
Every year, my
wife doesn't want

12:50.503 --> 12:52.405
to leave me behind, but...

12:52.439 --> 12:55.909
but who knows how many
holidays we have left

12:55.943 --> 12:58.311
to... to spend
with our grandkids?

12:58.345 --> 13:01.281
How about...
I write you a note

13:01.314 --> 13:05.418
for extreme exhaustion,
with a prescription for R & R?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.921
Would four days be enough?
That would be...

13:07.955 --> 13:09.890
a Christmas
miracle, Dr. Hart!

13:09.923 --> 13:11.291
Seriously!

13:11.324 --> 13:13.193
Let me get a pad.
Okay.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.329
(door opens)

13:16.363 --> 13:17.931
Oh, all set?

13:17.965 --> 13:20.300
What do you say
we go get some coffee?
Yeah.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.403
Mom, I am so sorry, but
this is gonna take a while.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.908
Oh, hey... you. Mm!

13:27.941 --> 13:29.109
Look, George, falling
in love with me quickly

13:29.142 --> 13:31.578
kind of comes with the territory
of looking how I look, but I

13:31.611 --> 13:33.580
just don't want to make
the same mistakes
I have in the past,

13:33.613 --> 13:35.582
and things are just going
way, way, way too fast

13:35.615 --> 13:38.051
with us right now,
so I think we need
to take a break.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.920
A break?

13:39.953 --> 13:42.122
But i-it's two days
before Christmas.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.257
Call you after the holidays.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.927
Uh, what...

13:46.960 --> 13:48.395
Thanks for meeting me.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.230
I need to ask
you a favor.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.599
Anything.
Well...

13:52.632 --> 13:56.136
I'm trying to sell Ruby
on eventually moving her
new company to BlueBell,

13:56.169 --> 13:58.972
or at least nearby, and it's
very important that this week,

13:59.006 --> 14:01.274
of all weeks, she
really love it here.

14:01.308 --> 14:04.077
I don't know what that
has to do with me.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.979
Well, you aren't exactly
making her feel welcome.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.514
Well, that's
because I loathe her

14:07.547 --> 14:09.149
with every fiber of my being.

14:09.182 --> 14:09.616
Lemon.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.218
Lavon...

14:11.251 --> 14:12.953
Ruby is meaner than
a sackful of rattlesnakes,

14:12.986 --> 14:15.355
and what you see in her,
I will never, ever, ever know.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.991
Look, I know you two have had
your differences, but...

14:18.025 --> 14:19.626
I got 14 more contests
to judge tomorrow,

14:19.659 --> 14:21.861
and I need this.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.398
So I'm asking you.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.267
Please, find it
in your heart

14:27.300 --> 14:30.403
to just reach
out to Ruby.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.073
Okay.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.308
For you, I will.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.144
Thank you.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.445
You have no idea

14:38.478 --> 14:40.547
what this
means to me.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.163
(George sighs)

14:56.196 --> 14:57.931
George Tucker,

14:57.965 --> 15:00.333
I 100% forbid you from spoiling
my little girl's Christmas.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.036
Okay, what are you...
I don't understand
anyone today.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.704
Just wait a week, wait a month,

15:04.737 --> 15:07.174
but you can't propose
to your new girlfriend now,

15:07.207 --> 15:08.942
not on Lemon's
first Christmas alone.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.410
I'm not proposing
to anyone, Brick.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.213
Then why, why did I find this

15:13.246 --> 15:14.681
in the Joseph costume, huh?

15:14.714 --> 15:17.350
That's... not mine.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.686
I'm not the only one who's
played Joseph this week.

15:19.719 --> 15:22.389
*

15:24.091 --> 15:26.026
(clears throat)

15:26.059 --> 15:27.460
(frustrated sigh)

15:30.330 --> 15:32.299
Hey. Lose something today?

15:32.332 --> 15:34.701
Oh, thank the good Lord.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.236
(laughs)

15:36.269 --> 15:38.071
(chuckles)

15:39.606 --> 15:41.474
Whew!

15:41.508 --> 15:44.511
I just can't believe
you spent six hours
with two patients.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.479
Well, it's because
I heal the whole patient,

15:46.513 --> 15:49.316
from mind, body to soul.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.385
As a matter of fact,
I saved an old couple's
Christmas today.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.122
Well, that's a lot of healing;
you must be exhausted.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.224
Well, maybe we could skip
the Christmas tree lighting?

15:57.257 --> 15:59.226
The tree lighting is
a pretty big deal,

15:59.259 --> 16:02.962
and I'm the town doctor,
so everyone counts
on me being here.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.536
What's going on?

16:09.569 --> 16:11.738
Apparently, the doctor
wrote a note saying,

16:11.771 --> 16:14.007
Señor Kringle
had exhaustion.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.344
Oh, my God,
Hal was Sant...

16:17.377 --> 16:18.478
Christmas Eve is ruined.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.115
No. We can still have
the tree lighting
without Santa.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.483
Santa's not coming?

16:23.516 --> 16:26.219
(children jeering)
This kind of thing
happens sometimes,

16:26.253 --> 16:28.121
but I'll fix it,
don't you worry.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.365
Really?!

16:38.398 --> 16:42.369
Really? You had to send
Santa to Pascagoula?

16:42.402 --> 16:45.238
I've been up all night
trying to fix this.

16:45.272 --> 16:48.108
Not only is there not
another Santa available,

16:48.141 --> 16:49.576
but apparently Hal
took his outfit with him

16:49.609 --> 16:52.712
and there's not another
Santa suit to be found
on the whole Gulf Coast.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.381
Of course there's not--
it's Christmas Eve!

16:54.414 --> 16:56.049
How could you
do this to me?!

16:56.083 --> 16:58.785
Stop yelling! I did
not do this to you.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.120
Well, it sure feels
like you did, Zoe.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.288
Because tonight
at the tree lighting,

17:01.321 --> 17:03.423
I was gonna give Ruby my gift.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.557
Which just so happens

17:04.590 --> 17:05.791
to be an engagement ring.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.396
Whoa! Wh-Whoa,
you were going to propose?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.064
Holy cow.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.432
Feelings,
so many feelings right now.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.434
That is a huge step.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.602
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.204
How could you not
tell me about this?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.570
Propose? Why?

17:18.605 --> 17:19.539
I love Ruby.

17:19.571 --> 17:21.141
And I want her
to leave

17:21.174 --> 17:22.742
knowing that I'm serious
about committing.

17:22.775 --> 17:23.710
Equally important,

17:23.742 --> 17:25.811
I wanted her to leave
with the greatest memory

17:25.845 --> 17:26.878
of BlueBell ever.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.216
Which is why I had this
whole magical night planned.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.152
There were gonna be Dickensian
carolers and everything.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.287
And then you got
Christmas Eve canceled!

17:34.321 --> 17:36.589
Hey, Lavon. Hey, honey.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.159
What's on the agenda today?
I was thinking maybe

17:39.192 --> 17:41.094
a little mother-and-
daughter day trip?

17:41.128 --> 17:44.231
I'm sorry, Mom, but today
I need to find a Santa.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.732
Hey, maybe you could
help me by making calls

17:45.765 --> 17:48.701
to all the important
people you know and seeing
if you could drum up a suit.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.570
I need Santa.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.440
Of course you do.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.642
I'll go make some calls.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.511
(door opens, bell tinkles)

17:58.545 --> 18:00.347
(clears throat softly)

18:00.380 --> 18:03.616
I'm glad that you were
able to meet me.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.853
Listen, I...
I'm not proud

18:06.886 --> 18:09.722
of my behavior at
the cookie contest,

18:09.756 --> 18:12.859
or in general,
since you arrived.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.895
I would like to help
you feel like you are
a part of this community,

18:15.928 --> 18:18.331
so later on, some
volunteers from church

18:18.365 --> 18:20.500
are gonna be wrapping gifts
at Santa's Workshop.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.636
Your little pal, Dr. Hart,
might have driven away Santa,

18:23.670 --> 18:25.205
but we are still determined

18:25.238 --> 18:26.739
to show the children
of BlueBell a good time.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.209
Surely you're not asking me
to dress up like an elf?

18:29.242 --> 18:31.911
Listen, Ruby, if you don't want
to do it for me, then do it

18:31.944 --> 18:34.147
for Lavon, because...

18:34.181 --> 18:37.850
I know that he would
really like you to try
and fit in here, too.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.388
Yeah. All right.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.722
I'll see you later.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.361
(door opens, bell tinkles)

18:48.395 --> 18:50.363
(big sigh)

18:50.397 --> 18:52.365
You're saying you don't
have a single Santa suit

18:52.399 --> 18:53.933
on that whole
bus of yours?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.402
You're supposed
to be a seamstress.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.537
How hard is it to
make a Santa suit?

18:57.570 --> 19:00.907
It is impossible to find
red felt this time of year!

19:00.940 --> 19:03.176
What if we got white felt
and colored it in?

19:03.210 --> 19:04.544
Oh!

19:06.346 --> 19:08.381
I have called all of my
East Coast connections.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.716
Found a few Santa suits,

19:09.749 --> 19:11.684
nothing that can
get here tonight.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.253
Thanks for trying.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.153
Hey, Dash!

19:15.488 --> 19:17.324
Hey, Dash.
Hello.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.425
I need your help.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.260
Think-- is there
anyone else in town

19:20.293 --> 19:22.262
who has a Santa suit
besides Hal?

19:22.295 --> 19:25.265
Well, Hal has been our Santa
for almost 25 years.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.633
Ever since Crazy
Earl retired.

19:29.436 --> 19:32.405
It's so cute how much you
care about these people,

19:32.439 --> 19:33.806
but we gave it a shot.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.842
How about we go
get manicured?

19:35.875 --> 19:37.944
Talk about that
haircut, huh?

19:37.977 --> 19:41.348
You know what?
Sorry, but we have
to do one thing first.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.583
I hope you don't
mind armadillos.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.453
Come on, Mom. Mom.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.887
What a misunderstanding.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.989
I can't believe
I thought you would propose.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.591
I would never propose
after a few weeks.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.293
That would be crazy.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.427
Totally crazy.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.429
Oh, I'm so relieved.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.465
For a second I thought
you lost your mind.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.832
No. Not at all.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.301
A-And please don't
take this personally,

20:01.334 --> 20:02.835
but I'm not rushing
into anything.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.704
I'm gonna take it
nice and slow.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.973
(sighs):
So am I.
See, truth is,

20:07.006 --> 20:08.575
I haven't even gotten you
a gift yet.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.910
Excuse me?

20:10.943 --> 20:12.845
Yeah. I mean,
I just didn't quite know

20:12.879 --> 20:14.981
what to get someone
I've only been dating a month.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.883
Yesterday you said
you got me a great gift.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.786
I lied. I just figured
that I'd wing it, you know?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.654
I'd be... spontaneous.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.889
But I got
you something,

20:22.922 --> 20:24.457
something great.
(laughs)

20:24.491 --> 20:26.993
What is wrong with you?
Why would you tell me this?

20:27.026 --> 20:28.628
I just thought that we
were being honest, but...

20:28.661 --> 20:30.897
I'll see you later.
I was just in the...

20:30.930 --> 20:33.032
I was just in the moment.
I just...

20:33.065 --> 20:34.967
I...
Hi, Georgie boy.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.771
Uh...

20:38.805 --> 20:41.874
Shelby, hey, what...
Oh, silly, I don't
mean any harm.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.643
It's not like
I'm gonna slap you again.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.746
I can see that you
need a little help.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.947
(chuckles) Yeah.
You know what?

20:47.980 --> 20:49.682
I've had enough
crazy in my life...

20:49.716 --> 20:51.751
I know...

20:51.784 --> 20:54.954
that I was a little
batty batso when
we were dating.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.023
I'd just gotten
out of a relationship,

20:57.056 --> 20:58.891
you'd just gotten
out of a relationship,

20:58.925 --> 21:00.560
and I'd just
gotten off caffeine.
Oh,

21:00.593 --> 21:01.761
and this is you
off of caffeine?

21:01.794 --> 21:03.630
Nope. I'm back on.
(laughs)

21:03.663 --> 21:05.898
And much, much saner.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.667
Yeah, clearly.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.903
And I want to make it up
to you by helping you find

21:10.937 --> 21:13.806
the perfect gift to get
your girlfriend back.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.675
Okay, and why would
you want to do that?

21:15.708 --> 21:17.677
My fingers are itching to shop.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.946
Oh, come on.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.549
That Tansy deserves a nice gift,
does she not?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.989
Okay.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.691
We can shop.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.859
(muffled squeal)
If...

21:32.892 --> 21:34.494
we stay in public places.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.834
Hey, sugar.

21:41.868 --> 21:42.935
Oh, hey, Daddy.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.070
What are you up to?

21:44.103 --> 21:46.539
I am doing a favor and
spending a terrible afternoon

21:46.573 --> 21:48.107
with the terrible
Ruby Jeffries.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.544
Ooh. Well, maybe you, uh,
better get used to her.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.079
She's going to be
our new first lady.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.547
What?

21:54.581 --> 21:55.815
That is the gossip.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.917
The mayor is proposing.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.092
Oh!

22:06.125 --> 22:07.093
Oh.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.361
It's the pretty doctor.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.696
Hi, Earl.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.564
Do you happen to have
a Santa suit?

22:11.598 --> 22:14.100
I happen to...
do have one.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.369
That's amazing.
I'll give you 50 bucks for it.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.104
No. I don't want
to sell my suit.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.839
Fine.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.375
I'll give you 50 bucks
to borrow your suit.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.576
Uh-uh. No.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.111
Earl, come on.
We don't have anyone

22:25.144 --> 22:26.779
to play Santa
for the tree lighting.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.715
Don't you care about the kids?

22:28.748 --> 22:31.584
Of course I care
about the kids.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.586
I used to be their Santa.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.354
So give me the suit.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.525
On one condition.

22:40.627 --> 22:41.794
Mom, meet Earl.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.896
He'll be our Santa tonight.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.738
(gasps)

22:51.771 --> 22:53.406
Is he drunk?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.007
No! Of course not.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.909
What kind of town
do you think this is?

22:56.943 --> 22:58.945
A drunk Santa?
I am outraged.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.080
You must be the mom.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.750
It's nice to meet you.

23:03.783 --> 23:06.619
Someday we may be in-laws,

23:06.653 --> 23:07.920
if you know what I mean.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.490
Okay, he is drunk.
Don't listen to him.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.692
Why don't you practice
your ho-ho-ho-ing?

23:12.725 --> 23:14.627
EARL:
Ho ho ho!

23:14.661 --> 23:16.463
(Earl coughing
and grunting)

23:24.871 --> 23:26.906
We want Santa! We want Santa!

23:26.939 --> 23:30.677
We want Santa!
We want Santa!

23:30.710 --> 23:32.545
Looks like the doctor
healed Santa up.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.081
Good news for good boys
and girls around the world.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.684
(cheering)

23:37.717 --> 23:39.185
EARL:
 Ho ho ho!

23:39.218 --> 23:40.653
Ho ho ho!

23:40.687 --> 23:41.921
Keep drinking
the coffee.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.923
You are doing
a good job.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.125
Whew!
Let's get you a shower.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.694
CANDACE:
So, Earl, you were saying

23:47.727 --> 23:49.095
something about your son...

23:49.128 --> 23:51.998
Earl loves the sun.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.100
Yeah. Vitamin D.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.536
Earl, who is your son?

23:56.569 --> 23:58.571
I told you-- he's drunk.
He doesn't know who his son is.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.540
He's had six cups of coffee.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.241
And people don't forget
their children.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.543
Earl, who is your son?

24:03.576 --> 24:04.944
Who do you think?

24:04.977 --> 24:06.212
The doctor's boyfriend.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.581
Wade.
Wade?

24:08.615 --> 24:10.583
Like, Wade next door?

24:10.617 --> 24:12.084
He is not my boyfriend.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.221
Nothing... nothing
is going on with me and Wa...

24:15.254 --> 24:16.589
EARL:
Hello, son.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.758
Wade. Nice to see you.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.560
What the hell
is going on here?

24:20.593 --> 24:21.828
I saved Christmas.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.095
Your dad is
going to be Santa.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.598
What is wrong with you?

24:25.632 --> 24:26.599
I happen to be
a great Santa.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.702
Wade, calm down.

24:29.736 --> 24:32.171
Come on.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.973
How could you ask
him to be Santa

24:34.006 --> 24:35.742
without talking
to me first?

24:35.775 --> 24:36.976
We haven't really been talking.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.745
This is not about
you, Dr. Hart.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.280
My dad... he is
not up for this.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.016
You know what happened
the last time he was Santa? Huh?

24:44.050 --> 24:45.585
He knocked over
the Christmas tree,

24:45.618 --> 24:46.886
yelled at the kids.
Half of them were crying.

24:46.919 --> 24:47.787
I know I certainly was.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.622
And now you want
to send him back out there

24:49.656 --> 24:51.591
to ruin more kids' Christmases?

24:51.624 --> 24:52.592
He said he wanted to do it.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.727
You are supposed to be
the doctor in this town.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.529
I wish to hell
you'd start acting like it.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.197
Oh, right, just walk away.
Real mature!

24:58.230 --> 24:59.899
(door closes)

24:59.932 --> 25:02.869
They don't seem
like a couple.

25:02.902 --> 25:06.606
Oh, they're
totally in love.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.074
You were exactly right.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.743
A necklace with the name
of her dog, Dolly Parton, on it.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.144
Shows that I know
what Tansy likes,

25:12.178 --> 25:13.312
but it's not too much.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.047
It's simple yet thoughtful.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.017
If I were you, I would get
a bottle and a blanket,

25:18.050 --> 25:21.020
and I would have the picnic
in Santa's house.

25:21.053 --> 25:24.023
And I would put
the necklace in the wine.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.192
Yeah, that's a little
too elaborate for me.

25:26.225 --> 25:30.196
Plus, it also sounds a lot
like a choking hazard, so...

25:30.229 --> 25:32.031
The reason why long-distance
couples don't work

25:32.064 --> 25:33.833
is because there's
no endgame.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.936
See, Lavon and I plan on
moving in together after a year.

25:36.969 --> 25:37.770
CRICKETT:
It sounds complicated.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.305
RUBY:
Oh, but it's
well worth it.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.908
Lavon and I have
history on our side.

25:41.941 --> 25:42.875
(chuckles)
What history?

25:42.909 --> 25:44.711
You've only been together
for a couple months.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.112
Lemon, sweetie,

25:46.145 --> 25:47.947
I think you need
to lay off that nog.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.316
Don't forget Lavon and I
dated in high school.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.919
He hasn't had a significant
relationship since me.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.121
That's right-- he's
never gotten over you.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.989
Anyone need more
double-sided tape?

25:58.357 --> 25:59.959
You are the love of his life.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.661
ANNABETH:
Who wants to sing
Christmas carols?

26:01.694 --> 26:02.929
(hums)

26:02.962 --> 26:04.063
I suppose I am.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.364
It's destiny.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.033
(laughs, snorts)

26:08.367 --> 26:09.268
Did you just snort?

26:09.301 --> 26:11.671
No.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.706
Poor Lemon-- must
be so hard for you

26:13.740 --> 26:15.842
to hear about my happiness
when it's your first holiday

26:15.875 --> 26:17.710
since being left
at the altar.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.885
You don't know what you're
talking about, Ruby Jeffries.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.353
In fact, you don't
know anything.

26:27.386 --> 26:28.420
You are a snobby witch,

26:28.454 --> 26:30.690
and you aren't the only person
that Lavon ever loved!

26:30.723 --> 26:32.625
Lemon!

26:32.659 --> 26:34.160
What are you talking about?

26:34.193 --> 26:35.594
Who else did he love?

26:47.874 --> 26:49.876
Who?

26:49.909 --> 26:52.745
Who did Lavon love?

26:56.148 --> 26:58.250
(sighs)

26:58.284 --> 26:59.886
Who?

27:01.754 --> 27:02.855
ZOE:
How you doing, Earl?

27:02.889 --> 27:05.124
I think I may
have made a mistake.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.193
It's been a long time
since I faced this town sober.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.260
You know what
they say.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.329
Just shake your belly
like a bowl full of jelly.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.931
You will be great.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.266
ANNABETH:
Lemon! Lemon!

27:14.300 --> 27:15.868
Stop!
(car horn honking)

27:15.902 --> 27:19.271
I thought you said
that other woman was Lemon.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.440
There are two.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.675
No, there aren't.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.412
I have been
trying so hard,

27:26.445 --> 27:28.280
biting my tongue,

27:28.314 --> 27:31.083
while you told lie after lie
ever since I got here.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.753
And the lies aren't even
well executed.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.755
People don't live
on the Mars Rover.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.290
There is no Mo
from Mobile.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.192
And the person you were seeing
was obviously Wade.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.094
I-I don't know what
to be madder about--

27:42.128 --> 27:44.230
the fact that you lied
or the fact that you

27:44.263 --> 27:46.165
didn't even bother
to make the lies good.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.034
Why didn't you
just tell me the truth?

27:48.067 --> 27:49.435
Why do you think?

27:49.468 --> 27:51.337
Because I didn't
want you to tell me

27:51.370 --> 27:53.706
that my whole life is a
complete and utter failure.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.107
I didn't want
you to judge me

27:55.141 --> 27:56.943
like you always do.
You know what?

27:56.976 --> 27:59.178
I came here to spend time
with my daughter.

27:59.211 --> 28:03.049
Maybe, if you had taken
one second out of your plan

28:03.082 --> 28:04.784
to not spend
one second alone with me,

28:04.817 --> 28:06.953
you might have noticed that
I haven't judged you at all.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.322
Well, not on
the important things.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.059
(sighs)

28:13.092 --> 28:14.761
W...

28:15.962 --> 28:17.263
Okay. Tree lighting's
about to start.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.330
Got the ring in my pocket.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.498
We all set?

28:19.531 --> 28:20.466
Yeah, we're great.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.068
Yeah.
(claps)

28:22.101 --> 28:23.369
Come on, E...

28:23.402 --> 28:25.004
Earl?

28:27.974 --> 28:29.108
Oh, holy oy.

28:35.782 --> 28:36.983
(cheers and applause)

28:38.985 --> 28:41.954
Santa is circling
Florida right now.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.356
Bit of clouds,
lots of turbulence.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.358
But don't worry,
he'll be here any minute.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.394
I'm gonna give him a call
and get an ETA.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.295
ALL:
Boo!

28:51.397 --> 28:53.900
(sighs)
Santa's

28:53.933 --> 28:56.302
still missing.
You mean Crazy Earl
disappointed you?

28:56.335 --> 28:57.837
Shocker.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.171
Wade, you have to help me
find him. Please.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.373
(sighs)

29:01.407 --> 29:02.909
Look, I'll go look for him

29:02.942 --> 29:04.911
because you don't know
what you did.

29:04.944 --> 29:07.279
But he cannot be Santa tonight.
He is in no state.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.882
No. He has to be.
No one else can do it,

29:09.916 --> 29:11.517
and Lavon needs him
for his plan...

29:11.550 --> 29:13.052
(whispering):
...to propose to Ruby.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.123
Meet me at the church
in five minutes.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.991
Okay, now, when I say
"I love you,"
Mm-hmm.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.459
you start singing.
Got it, Mr. Mayor.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.429
You can count on us.
All right.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.865
Oh, isn't it romantic?

29:25.898 --> 29:29.335
Two proposals
in one night.
(giggles)

29:29.368 --> 29:31.037
WADE:
 Remember when you used
 to call that old

29:31.070 --> 29:33.039
station wagon your sleigh?

29:33.072 --> 29:35.274
I mean, you were
a damn good Santa.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.443
(chuckles)
Before.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.345
(door opens)
WADE:
I remember.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.147
Hell, you...

29:41.180 --> 29:44.216
you knew how to coax
the shy ones and...

29:44.250 --> 29:46.585
soften the blow
for the ones who...

29:46.618 --> 29:49.288
wanted more than their
parents could afford.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.522
You were great.

29:51.858 --> 29:54.193
And, yeah, one year...

29:55.327 --> 29:56.462
...you weren't.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.331
Come on, Dad.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.466
She had just died.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.070
The cancer was...

30:05.371 --> 30:07.506
It was awful.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.508
But you think anybody

30:09.541 --> 30:11.210
in this town
remembers you

30:11.243 --> 30:13.045
messing that
Christmas up?

30:13.079 --> 30:14.947
But you do.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.950
Yeah.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.087
That doesn't mean
I don't understand.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.856
(sighs)

30:23.890 --> 30:26.125
I told the doc
I wanted to be Santa

30:26.158 --> 30:28.928
'cause I wanted
to make it up to everyone.

30:28.961 --> 30:29.962
To you.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.466
But I can't.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.102
I just can't go out there again.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.471
Dad.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.540
It's a time for miracles.

30:41.573 --> 30:42.942
(chuckles)

30:42.975 --> 30:44.610
And I believe
that you,

30:44.643 --> 30:46.112
Earl...

30:47.313 --> 30:49.415
...can be a normal person
for two hours.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.452
I'll help you.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.458
(sniffles)

31:03.329 --> 31:05.064
(Wade sighs)

31:06.665 --> 31:08.968
You never told me any
of that stuff about your family.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.502
Well, you never asked.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.637
It wasn't...

31:11.670 --> 31:14.006
the way we were.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.508
Doesn't mean that I didn't
want to know.

31:16.542 --> 31:20.279
Well, it's a little late
for that now, isn't it?

31:27.053 --> 31:28.587
Okay, now, when I say
"I love you," hit it.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.655
You got it?
Yeah? Okay.

31:29.688 --> 31:30.656
Whoa.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.924
Whoa. I see her.
She's here.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.293
(laughs)
Red alert!
Red alert!

31:34.326 --> 31:35.995
Hey.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.296
Hi. You're here.

31:37.329 --> 31:40.399
I-I have something for you.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.668
Did you have a thing
with Lemon Breeland?

31:42.701 --> 31:44.670
Uh, yes, a-a long time ago,

31:44.703 --> 31:47.406
but we have more important
things to discuss. Come on.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.008
Did you love her?!

31:49.041 --> 31:51.177
I need to know.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.445
No, no, really, we have more
important stuff to talk about.

31:53.479 --> 31:54.680
Come on.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.082
You did, didn't you?

31:58.517 --> 32:00.286
Lavon, why wouldn't you
just tell me?

32:00.319 --> 32:02.221
Because it wasn't relevant.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.690
Look, I know
how you feel about Lemon,

32:04.723 --> 32:06.625
and, well, there's nothing
between her and me anymore.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.027
I love you!

32:08.060 --> 32:10.096
Oh, he said it.
He said it.

32:10.129 --> 32:12.564
* Oh, the weather outside
is frightful *

32:12.598 --> 32:15.434
* But the fire
is so delightful... *

32:15.467 --> 32:18.070
Lavon, long distance
relationships are hard.

32:18.104 --> 32:21.240
And you can't do
it without trust.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.242
How can I trust you when
you somehow forgot to mention

32:23.275 --> 32:25.077
that Lemon Breeland
was the love of your life?

32:25.111 --> 32:26.445
I mean, I don't know

32:26.478 --> 32:28.180
what I'm supposed to
think or believe anymore.

32:28.214 --> 32:30.582
What am I supposed to do now?

32:30.616 --> 32:32.651
* How I hate going out
in the storm *

32:32.684 --> 32:35.187
* But if you'll really
hold me tight *

32:35.221 --> 32:37.056
Marry me?

32:37.089 --> 32:40.659
* All the way home
I'll be warm *

32:40.692 --> 32:44.063
* Oh, the fire
is slowly dying *

32:44.096 --> 32:47.066
* And my dear,
we're still good-bying *

32:47.099 --> 32:50.269
* But as long
as you love me so *

32:50.302 --> 32:52.438
* Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow. *

33:03.649 --> 33:05.684
So, are you ready
for the greatest gift ever?

33:05.717 --> 33:07.253
Yes, ma'am.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.355
All right.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.756
Let's see what
you got here.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.691
(clears his throat)

33:13.792 --> 33:16.162
I-I... I love it.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.163
(laughs)

33:17.196 --> 33:18.564
What is it?

33:18.597 --> 33:20.632
Oh. It's a pear cozy.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.769
See, I know that pears
are your favorite fruit,

33:23.802 --> 33:26.638
so now you can take one
to work in your briefcase

33:26.672 --> 33:27.673
without it getting bruised.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.241
(laughs)

33:29.275 --> 33:30.709
Uh, I made it myself.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.378
Took knitting lessons
from Shula and everything.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.580
You're right.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.382
This is the
greatest gift ever.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.051
(laughs)

33:41.187 --> 33:43.122
Thank you.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.556
You're welcome.
Where's mine?

33:44.590 --> 33:45.791
You know what?

33:45.824 --> 33:48.394
I-I don't want to
give it to you here.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.796
I want to... I want
to make it special.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.398
Grab that blanket,

33:52.431 --> 33:54.700
and I'll get
some wine, and, uh...

33:54.733 --> 33:56.435
Come on.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.804
Okay.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.540
My last gift goes
to you, little

34:01.573 --> 34:03.309
fisher dude. Enjoy!

34:03.342 --> 34:04.543
Santa's got to go.

34:04.576 --> 34:05.477
Santa, don't go.

34:05.511 --> 34:06.812
Oh, well,

34:06.845 --> 34:09.715
I have many, many more gifts
to give out.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.751
Then I got to head back
home and feed my reindeer.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.553
But I'll see you
again next year

34:14.585 --> 34:15.321
if you're good.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.822
Come on, buddy.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.824
Santa's got to get back
to his sleigh.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.359
You run along now.
Come on, Santa.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.328
You did a great job.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.330
Thanks, son.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.398
Ho, ho, ho, ho,
this way. Let's go.

34:30.668 --> 34:34.306
AnnaBeth explained
everything,

34:34.340 --> 34:36.507
and, well, I am horrified,

34:36.542 --> 34:38.476
scandalized and impressed
all at once.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.212
I want details.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.481
And I can't wait
to give them to you.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.483
In the New Year.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.217
(sighs)

34:47.753 --> 34:49.321
What was she
talking about?

34:49.355 --> 34:51.790
Nothing.

34:51.822 --> 34:54.393
Well, a lot, but...

34:54.426 --> 34:56.661
I'd rather not
get into it tonight.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.631
Daddy, would you mind if I just
go home and take a bath,

34:59.665 --> 35:02.368
and I can just
see you tomorrow?

35:02.401 --> 35:04.470
Oh, now, no, no.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.172
Whatever you
need, Lemonade.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.649
I'm sorry.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.154
I'm sorry I-I
ran out on you.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.889
No. I should have told you
about Lemon.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.225
Lemon is just one thing.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.759
I mean, let's just
face it, Lavon.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.628
We both have been
fundamentally dishonest

35:29.661 --> 35:31.363
with each other.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.165
I've never lied to you
about a single other thing.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.300
Really?
Yeah.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.668
I mean, do you really
see yourself leaving BlueBell

35:36.702 --> 35:38.437
and moving to Dallas?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.272
Well, you can move here.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.573
Come on, Lavon.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.375
I mean, that's just it.

35:43.409 --> 35:46.278
We have to stop
fooling ourselves.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.647
I mean, the way you feel
about the big city

35:48.680 --> 35:50.649
is how I feel about this town.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.651
So, what-what does that mean?

35:52.684 --> 35:54.586
It means...

35:54.620 --> 35:56.588
Lavon Hayes,

35:56.622 --> 35:59.658
although I love you,

35:59.691 --> 36:02.661
we... this...

36:02.694 --> 36:04.430
Please don't say, "Over."

36:06.565 --> 36:09.268
It's Christmas Eve.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.737
Then I'll just say good night.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.316
Okay, you were right.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.685
A) this place
does still smell,

36:26.718 --> 36:29.855
B) you didn't
judge me. I did.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.957
I made some
big mistakes,

36:31.990 --> 36:33.825
and I didn't want
to see them through your eyes.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.594
Do you mean you're not happy
you moved to Alabama?

36:35.627 --> 36:38.230
No, I am.
I like my life here.

36:38.264 --> 36:40.566
Weirdly, being
a GP suits me.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.735
And Lavon-- he's, like, the best
friend that I have ever had.

36:43.769 --> 36:46.505
I'm even getting a
taste for catfish.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.375
It's my romantic life
that has been a disaster.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.876
You mean... Wade?

36:50.909 --> 36:52.511
(sighs)

36:54.780 --> 36:57.983
I got scared, so
I pushed him away.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.618
But I miss him.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.487
I know, you don't get that.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.323
I'm not sure I see the two
of you having a future,

37:04.356 --> 37:05.924
but you know what?

37:05.957 --> 37:07.726
I don't want
to judge you anymore.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.261
You're a grown woman.

37:09.295 --> 37:10.462
Besides, what do I know?

37:10.496 --> 37:13.932
I mean, the only real risk
I ever took was having an affair

37:13.965 --> 37:15.767
with a small-town GP

37:15.801 --> 37:19.037
on a Greek cruise years ago,
and that got me you.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.639
Thanks.

37:20.672 --> 37:24.343
You have made some decisions
in your life

37:24.376 --> 37:26.011
that I absolutely question.

37:26.044 --> 37:30.382
Beginning with your choice
to live so far away from me, but

37:30.416 --> 37:31.883
if you want to be with him,

37:31.917 --> 37:33.819
don't let my irrational fears,
or worse,

37:33.852 --> 37:35.354
your irrational fears,

37:35.387 --> 37:36.722
stop you from being happy.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.962
(knocking)

37:47.466 --> 37:49.401
Lavon.

37:50.736 --> 37:53.572
I asked you...
to be her friend.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.907
Not tell her something

37:55.941 --> 37:57.776
that was not your business
to tell!

37:57.809 --> 37:59.711
I know. I am so sorry!
Worse,

37:59.745 --> 38:01.513
I can't believe
you had the audacity

38:01.547 --> 38:03.982
to tell Ruby that she wasn't
the love of my life.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.150
She could have been!

38:05.183 --> 38:09.054
She didn't have some fiancé
she was never going to leave!

38:09.087 --> 38:11.423
I know. I am so, so,
so, so, sorry.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.824
I will talk to
her, and I will

38:12.858 --> 38:14.526
make it better,
I promise you.
No.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.662
There's no point.
She just broke up with me.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.830
Oh, my God.

38:18.864 --> 38:21.767
I will never
forgive you for this.

38:25.437 --> 38:26.905
(door slams shut)

38:29.908 --> 38:31.577
George Tucker,
where are you taking me?

38:31.610 --> 38:33.111
Shh, shh. I
just figured

38:33.144 --> 38:35.347
that we'd shake up the
gift-giving a little bit.

38:35.381 --> 38:36.482
All right?
Hold on.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.885
(clears throat)

38:39.918 --> 38:43.722
Oh. Oh, my God,
I'm-I'm so sorry.

38:43.755 --> 38:44.490
I didn't...
(gasps)
Oh!

38:44.523 --> 38:45.557
Shelby?

38:45.591 --> 38:46.458
Hey, George.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.862
Brick? Brick. No.

38:50.896 --> 38:51.697
Uh...

38:51.730 --> 38:52.831
No, no. No.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.366
Hello, son.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.735
Uh, please,
never speak of this.

38:56.768 --> 38:59.571
No problem.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.440
Okay. Change of plans.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.708
Back to my boat
immediately.

39:02.741 --> 39:03.842
Are you okay?

39:03.875 --> 39:05.377
Oh, yeah, sure.

39:05.411 --> 39:07.145
Nothing that months and
months of therapy won't fix.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.480
(sighs)

39:13.919 --> 39:15.821
Doctor.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.124
I just wanted
to apologize.

39:19.157 --> 39:22.060
(laughs)

39:22.093 --> 39:24.796
For, uh, which thing exactly?

39:24.830 --> 39:27.032
(laughs)

39:30.068 --> 39:31.937
For our date
at the picnic.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.809
You really put
yourself out there,

39:37.843 --> 39:41.146
and I was so scared
that it wouldn't work,

39:41.179 --> 39:44.683
you know, that we would
have nothing in common,

39:44.716 --> 39:46.051
I kind of sabotaged it.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.055
But the thing that
I realized was...

39:54.125 --> 39:57.663
It turns out
that I like you,

39:57.696 --> 40:00.432
Wade Kinsella.

40:00.466 --> 40:01.633
I really like you.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.435
(sighs)

40:03.469 --> 40:05.170
And who knows?

40:05.203 --> 40:07.973
Maybe there's a chance,

40:08.006 --> 40:10.008
you and I could
be happy together.

40:11.677 --> 40:13.812
We'll never know
unless we try.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.051
What are...?

40:20.085 --> 40:22.053
What are you saying?

40:22.087 --> 40:24.055
(sighs)

40:24.089 --> 40:27.225
What I'm saying...

40:27.258 --> 40:30.195
is that,
would you maybe consider...

40:30.228 --> 40:32.598
(sighs)

40:32.631 --> 40:35.601
...being my for-real,

40:35.634 --> 40:38.069
out-in-public,
everyone-knows-about,

40:38.103 --> 40:40.038
actual boyfriend?

40:44.843 --> 40:46.845
It's okay.
You know what?

40:46.878 --> 40:48.847
You can think about it, 'cause

40:48.880 --> 40:51.149
I know that I am
a handful, and

40:51.182 --> 40:52.551
neurotic, and sometimes

40:52.584 --> 40:54.986
I am too bossy, and
that I do that, but...

41:04.596 --> 41:06.565
Come here.

41:06.598 --> 41:07.766
Oh.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.735
(laughs)

41:11.737 --> 41:13.705
(laughs)

41:13.739 --> 41:14.973
It's Christmas Eve, Doc.

41:15.006 --> 41:17.142
Crazier things have
happened on this night

41:17.175 --> 41:18.744
than a doctor
and a bartender.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.679
(laughs)

41:25.016 --> 41:31.890
* Have yourself a merry
little Christmas... *

41:31.923 --> 41:33.525
Can you shut up?

41:33.559 --> 41:37.028
We're kind of busy here.

41:39.698 --> 41:48.940
* Hang a shining star
upon the highest bow *

41:48.974 --> 41:54.179
* And have yourself
a merry little Christmas now. *

41:54.212 --> 41:58.216
