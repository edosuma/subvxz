WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:03.337
Parker Abrams.

00:03.371 --> 00:04.405
I'm at Kresge Hall.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.873
Buffy Summers.
Stevenson.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.875
Previously
 on Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:10.044 --> 00:11.144
PARKER:
 What are you doing?

00:11.179 --> 00:13.114
BUFFY:
 Making a choice.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.986
Parker, did I do
 something wrong?

00:20.019 --> 00:21.321
PARKER:
 Didn't you have fun?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.722
Is that all it was?

00:22.756 --> 00:24.824
What else was it
supposed to be?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.428
BUFFY:
 He's manipulative and shallow,

00:27.460 --> 00:29.163
and why doesn't he want me?

00:29.196 --> 00:30.397
WILLOW:
 I think you're missing
 something

00:30.431 --> 00:33.866
about the whole
poop-head principle.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.204
Anya, hi again.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.841
So, college not so scary
 after all, huh?

00:41.875 --> 00:44.445
BUFFY:
 It's turning out to be a lot
 like high school.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.813
Which I can handle.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.287
I don't know.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.356
I was going for ferocious-scary,

00:56.390 --> 00:59.893
but it's coming out
more dryly sardonic.

00:59.926 --> 01:03.363
It does appear to be mocking
you with its eyeholes.

01:03.396 --> 01:07.200
Yet its nosehole seems
sad and full of self-loathing.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.969
What do you think, Buff?

01:10.003 --> 01:12.906
I was just thinking about
the life of a pumpkin.

01:12.939 --> 01:17.411
Grow up in the sun,
happily entwined with others,

01:17.444 --> 01:20.881
and then someone comes along,
cuts you open,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.950
and rips your guts out.

01:24.951 --> 01:28.555
Okay... and on that happy note,

01:28.588 --> 01:30.557
got a treat
for tomorrow night's

01:30.591 --> 01:33.394
second annual
Halloween screening.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.930
People, prepare to have
your spines tingled

01:36.963 --> 01:41.468
and your gooses bumped by
the terrifying Fantasia.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.969
Fantasia?

01:43.003 --> 01:45.239
Maybe it's 'cause
of all the horrific things

01:45.272 --> 01:47.674
we've seen, but hippos wearing
tutus just don't unnerve me

01:47.707 --> 01:48.808
the way they used to.

01:48.841 --> 01:50.811
Phantasm.

01:50.843 --> 01:52.912
It was supposed
to be Phantasm.

01:52.945 --> 01:55.415
Stupid video store.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.850
I thought we were doing
the Alpha Delt thing.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.087
What... thing?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.590
The scary house?
Sounds kind of lame.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.424
OZ:
It actually borders on fun.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.159
You have to go through
the whole scary house maze

02:06.194 --> 02:07.594
to get to the party,

02:07.628 --> 02:08.762
which is usually worth
getting to.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.163
Those guys go all out.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.865
As witnessed last Friday.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.634
Very true.
There's a party?

02:13.667 --> 02:15.235
We didn't tell you?

02:16.836 --> 02:18.171
No, it's cool.

02:18.205 --> 02:21.040
You guys got
your little college thing.

02:21.074 --> 02:24.044
I'm fine. I mean, I got
better things to do

02:24.076 --> 02:26.313
than tag along
to some fraternity.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.147
You can come.
Okay.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.617
But only because I lied about
having better things to do.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.152
OZ:
Laughs will be had by all.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.555
I'm gonna get going.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.824
Now? The night's still...

02:37.858 --> 02:41.161
Well, okay, it's
a little mature, but still...

02:41.194 --> 02:44.397
I'm sleepy.
You guys have fun.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.466
You want me to come with?

02:45.498 --> 02:47.200
No, I'm fine.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.741
Sad Buffy.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.444
She didn't even
touch her pumpkin.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.180
It's a freak with no face.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.349
She still suffering a little
post-Parker depression?

03:02.383 --> 03:04.485
Bailing on the Buff.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.221
Does anyone else want
to smack that guy?

03:22.735 --> 03:24.170
Hah!

03:24.204 --> 03:27.106
(grunting)

03:27.139 --> 03:30.411
Oh. Geez, that hurt.

03:30.443 --> 03:33.813
What the hell's wrong
with you, lady?

03:37.216 --> 03:38.985
That's what
I'd like to know.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.759
(wolf howling)

03:46.793 --> 03:49.062
*

04:39.879 --> 04:41.481
I've got the basics down--

04:41.514 --> 04:43.817
levitation, charms,
glamours.

04:43.850 --> 04:47.120
I just feel like
I've plateaued Wicca-wise.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.988
What's the next level?

04:49.021 --> 04:51.191
Transmutation,
conjuring,

04:51.223 --> 04:53.927
bringing forth
something from nothing.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.930
Gets you pretty close
to the primal forces.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.031
A little scary.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.533
Well, no one's pushing.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.168
You know, if it's
too much, don't do it.

05:02.201 --> 05:03.637
Don't do it?

05:03.670 --> 05:05.706
What kind of
encouragement is that?

05:05.738 --> 05:07.841
This is
an encouragement talk?

05:07.875 --> 05:10.677
I thought it was
"share my pain."

05:10.711 --> 05:12.545
I don't know.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.047
Then again,
what is college for

05:14.081 --> 05:15.848
if not experimenting?

05:15.882 --> 05:18.619
You know, maybe
I can handle it.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.653
I'll know when
I've reached my limit.

05:20.687 --> 05:21.654
Wine coolers?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.023
Magic.

05:23.055 --> 05:24.557
Ooh. Didn't encourage her,
did you?

05:24.591 --> 05:27.560
Where's supportive
boyfriend guy?

05:27.595 --> 05:29.028
Oh, he's picking up
your dry cleaning.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.697
But he told me
to tell you,

05:30.730 --> 05:31.865
he's afraid
you're gonna get hurt.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.233
Okay, Brutus.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.870
Brutus. Uh, Caesar?

05:38.838 --> 05:40.707
Betrayal...
trusted friend.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.908
Backstabby.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.711
I'm with you on
the reference, but...

05:43.744 --> 05:46.579
I won't lie about
the fact that I worry.

05:46.613 --> 05:50.584
I know what it's like to have
power you can't control.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.586
And every time
I start to wolf out,

05:52.620 --> 05:56.656
I touch something...
deep... dark.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.257
It's not fun.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.564
But just know that
whatever you decide,

06:03.596 --> 06:05.499
I'll back your play.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.033
BUFFY:
See?

06:07.067 --> 06:08.869
Concerned boy
is sweet boy.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.670
I know.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.105
I kind of like him
worrying, anyway.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.942
(laughter)

06:18.110 --> 06:19.747
You know, um...

06:19.779 --> 06:23.250
I forgot to...

06:23.283 --> 06:24.718
be hungry.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.487
Wait. Buffy.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.589
Buffy.

06:29.622 --> 06:31.625
Don't let jerky Parker
chase you away.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.461
He didn't.

06:33.494 --> 06:37.465
I just don't want to
deal with this right now.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.031
I'm taking a holiday
from dealing,

06:39.066 --> 06:42.603
happily vacationing
in the land of not coping.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.971
Know what? You'll feel better
at the party tonight.

06:45.004 --> 06:47.274
Maybe you'll even meet someone.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.042
Willow, I don't
want to meet someone.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.612
I've reached my quota
on someones.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.146
Besides, I think I'm gonna
have to patrol, anyway.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.584
Tonight?
But it's Halloween.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.784
I'll double-check
with Giles,

06:57.817 --> 06:59.286
but I'm sure
he's gonna think

06:59.319 --> 07:01.153
I should be on
active slayer duty.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.557
He doesn't care
about Halloween.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.158
Happy Hal...

07:05.192 --> 07:06.459
Hello, Buffy.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.798
Oh, my God.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.466
It's a sombrero.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.834
And it's on your head.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.136
It seemed festive.
Come in.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.471
Candy?

07:20.507 --> 07:23.343
What is going on here?

07:23.375 --> 07:24.944
You hate Halloween.

07:24.978 --> 07:28.348
I-I've never said
any such thing.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.783
As my watcher's duties
took precedence,

07:30.817 --> 07:32.985
I simply hadn't
taken time to...

07:33.019 --> 07:35.422
well, to embrace
its inherent charms.

07:35.454 --> 07:36.824
Until now.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.158
Look, look.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.259
It's alive! (laughing)

07:40.293 --> 07:42.194
You see?

07:42.228 --> 07:44.363
See how he... shakes?

07:44.396 --> 07:46.500
Is there something you wanted?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.034
I was thinking that
I should patrol tonight.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.836
You know, possibly the cemetery,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.471
or if you had a better su...

07:52.805 --> 07:54.473
Could you please take that off?

07:54.507 --> 07:56.475
Oh, yes, of course.

07:56.509 --> 08:00.012
I see. Is there some specific
danger you were sensing?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.380
No.

08:01.413 --> 08:03.016
You know, but then we were
all caught off guard

08:03.050 --> 08:05.351
when Ethan turned everyone
into their costumes.

08:05.384 --> 08:06.954
True, but what happened
then was anomalous.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.122
Creatures of the night
shy away from Halloween.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.790
They find it all
much too crass.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.291
Hard to believe.

08:12.324 --> 08:15.295
Uh, well, I-I-I promise you,

08:15.327 --> 08:16.896
there's little likelihood

08:16.930 --> 08:19.733
of any supernatural
activity tonight.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.968
Sure you don't want one?

08:22.002 --> 08:25.471
* You want so much for everyone
to like you for who *

08:25.504 --> 08:27.240
* You really are

08:27.274 --> 08:31.478
* But you care about it so much,
you won't be yourself *

08:31.511 --> 08:34.380
* But I know you
so much better than that *

08:34.413 --> 08:35.649
* And I know you...

08:35.682 --> 08:36.649
(gasps)

08:36.683 --> 08:38.250
(chuckling)

08:38.284 --> 08:40.419
I come
bearing spiders.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.490
Sound system's
not gonna cut it.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.924
It's nothing but lame.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.225
You want me to call Oz?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.760
He can probably
hook us up.

08:47.794 --> 08:48.895
Do it.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.831
If we cannot scare
the young women,

08:50.864 --> 08:53.066
they will not
fall into our arms.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.903
We'll have womanless arms.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.405
Halloween's not about thrills,
chills, and funny costumes.

08:59.438 --> 09:01.341
It's about getting laid.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.844
Is there any holiday
that's not about getting laid?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.177
Arbor Day.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.014
Call Oz, dude.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.215
Done.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.883
And, oh,

09:09.917 --> 09:11.183
you wanted a symbol
to paint upstairs--

09:11.217 --> 09:12.753
something mystical.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.221
Check this out.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.589
* But you care
about it so much... *

09:15.623 --> 09:17.224
(chuckles)

09:24.230 --> 09:28.301
Anya. You really have to get
this knocking thing down.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.437
How did you...?

09:30.470 --> 09:32.371
Your Uncle Rory let me in.

09:32.404 --> 09:34.942
Does he always smell
like peppermint?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.210
The man likes his schnapps.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.078
What are you doing here?

09:39.111 --> 09:41.048
You haven't called.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.481
Not once.

09:42.514 --> 09:44.751
You said you were over me.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.052
And you just
accepted that?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.620
I only said that
because I thought

09:47.654 --> 09:49.056
that's what you wanted to hear.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.890
Well, that's the
funny thing about me--

09:50.923 --> 09:53.059
I tend to hear
the actual words people say

09:53.092 --> 09:54.226
and accept them at face value.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.629
That's stupid.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.798
I accept that.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.467
I can't say seeing you

10:01.500 --> 10:03.937
falls into the realm
of a bad thing.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.605
Really?

10:08.508 --> 10:12.479
I thought maybe we could
go out tonight

10:12.511 --> 10:14.014
for our anniversary.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.514
Anniversary?

10:15.548 --> 10:17.985
It's been exactly one week
since we copulated.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.152
Did you forget?

10:19.186 --> 10:21.321
No, of course not.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.692
It's just I already have plans
with Buffy, Willow and Oz.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.092
It's Halloween, you know.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.794
I don't understand.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.263
Well, every October 31, we
mortals dress up in masks...

10:30.297 --> 10:32.164
No, no. I understand
that inane ritual.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.667
It's those people.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.534
And you continue
to associate with them

10:35.567 --> 10:37.136
though you share
little in common.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.638
What are you
talking about?

10:38.672 --> 10:41.474
I mean, they go to college.
You don't.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.176
They no longer
live at home.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.543
You do.

10:44.576 --> 10:46.613
Well, hey, those things--

10:46.645 --> 10:51.118
the bonds of true
friendships transcends...

10:51.150 --> 10:52.820
Could we just change
the subject?

10:52.852 --> 10:53.986
Okay, okay, don't get
upset with me.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.855
I just wondered.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.960
If you want, you can come
with me tonight to this party.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.962
You mean, like a date?

11:02.995 --> 11:05.999
Is that what this is?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.803
Are we dating?

11:10.837 --> 11:14.374
There are definitely date-like
qualities at work here.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.309
Oh.
You'll need a costume.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.846
A costume?

11:18.879 --> 11:21.480
Dress up. You know,
something scary.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.984
Scary? Scary how?

11:24.017 --> 11:28.321
Anya, you, ex-demon, terrorized
mankind for centuries.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.023
I'm sure you'll
come up with something.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.563
Excuse me,
Professor Walsh?

11:37.596 --> 11:40.900
I came to get
today's assignments.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.669
I, uh, couldn't
make it to class

11:43.702 --> 11:44.937
for personal
reasons.

11:44.971 --> 11:49.241
Right. I count
four limbs, a head.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.576
No visible scarring.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.278
So I assume
your personal issue

11:52.312 --> 11:54.346
wasn't a life-threatening
accident of any kind

11:54.380 --> 11:56.216
and I'm therefore uninterested.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.451
You've got problems,
solve them on your own time.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.220
Miss another class,
and you're out.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.591
She means it, you know.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.726
Yeah.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.562
I got the impression she wasn't
saying it to make me laugh.

12:10.596 --> 12:13.801
You got to be aware your work's
taken a little downturn lately.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.436
I can't remember the last time
I saw your hand up.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.937
Does stretching count?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.706
Look, things get pretty intense
freshman year,

12:20.740 --> 12:22.274
as I dimly recall.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.476
Too much fun
or not enough?

12:25.812 --> 12:28.048
Both, actually.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.549
Yeah, well, you just got
to keep your priorities.

12:30.582 --> 12:32.418
Professor Walsh
is worth your time.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.586
Thanks.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.154
I'll get this done tonight.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.556
Tonight?
It's Halloween.

12:36.588 --> 12:38.591
What, you're not gonna
dress up and go party?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.927
Nah. I have a lot of work to do.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.263
I may be
out of line here,

12:43.296 --> 12:44.563
and it's not really
my business,

12:44.596 --> 12:46.599
but you seem like
the kind of person

12:46.633 --> 12:48.268
who makes things really
hard on themselves.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.736
Halloween isn't a night
for responsibility.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.772
It's when the ghosts
and goblins come out.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.274
That's actually
a misnomer.

12:55.307 --> 12:57.610
Well, I didn't mean real ones.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.114
But, hey, there is
some good, scary fun

13:01.148 --> 13:02.349
to be had on campus tonight.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.116
Yeah? What are
you doing?

13:04.150 --> 13:07.187
Well, I am gonna sit here
and grade papers.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.187
Scary.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.355
Very.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.691
Well, thanks for
the pep talk, Coach.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.159
Don't make fun.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.128
I worked long and hard
to get this pompous.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.629
No, I mean it.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.532
You're welcome.

13:33.645 --> 13:35.481
Okay. Watch your step, boys.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.484
Paint's still wet
in a few spots.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.187
Thanks for the loan, man.
Our sound system sucks.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.688
Mi Casio es su Casio.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.126
Well, that's an interesting
little design.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.495
What does it mean?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.529
No clue. I got it
out of this book.

13:50.562 --> 13:52.365
There's a lot of really
cool stuff in there about...

13:52.399 --> 13:53.866
Ooh! Grapes.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.236
Wow. Peeled.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.905
You guys know how
to spoil your guests.

13:58.938 --> 14:00.673
Eyeballs, man.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.241
Blindfold chicks,

14:02.274 --> 14:03.676
have them put their hands
in the bowl,

14:03.710 --> 14:05.378
then tell them it's eyeballs.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.812
They love that.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.381
And here I was wasting time
buying them flowers

14:09.416 --> 14:11.384
and complimenting them
on their shoes.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.821
So, you go through the whole
house of horrors downstairs,

14:14.854 --> 14:16.423
and it ends up here.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.724
Sweet.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.826
You fratly guys
have a nice setup.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.427
Hey, mighty, mighty Alpha Delts.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.196
You should think about pledging.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.663
Oh, Xander's a civilian.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.533
Ah. Townie, huh?
Didn't know.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.402
He looked so normal.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.403
You sure we should we let
him come to the party, Oz?

14:31.437 --> 14:32.940
Hey, standing right here.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.240
(thunder and screaming play
over speakers)

14:36.808 --> 14:37.945
Crank it!

14:39.446 --> 14:42.715
Sensing a disturbance
in the force, master?

14:42.749 --> 14:44.384
Ah, left speaker's
crackling a little bit.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.386
And you feel stabbing it
is the proper solution?

14:47.419 --> 14:49.389
I'm just gonna trim the wire.
Might be a short.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.191
Ah!

14:51.224 --> 14:52.392
Oz?

14:52.424 --> 14:54.594
Cut myself.

14:54.626 --> 14:57.364
It's okay.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.966
Playing with knives?
Fun, yes, but not safe.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.234
Well, when you
bleed to death,

15:01.268 --> 15:02.634
I got dibs on your equipment.

15:19.751 --> 15:21.721
Thanks again for doing this
at the last minute.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.755
Oh, I'm just glad
I could find it.

15:23.789 --> 15:26.759
There. Try it now.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.428
I let down the hem and loosened
it a little around the hood.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.931
Oh, it feels better.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.735
Oh, no.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.738
Someone's getting
nostalgic face.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.773
I'm sorry.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.009
I'm thinking about that
little girl who wore that.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.912
What is it, five...
six years ago?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.514
Yeah, when
Little Red Riding Hood

15:47.547 --> 15:49.816
was the cutting edge
in costumes.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.818
Oh, your father loved
to take you out.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.653
He was such a pain.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.755
12 years old, and I can't go
trick-or-treating by myself?

15:56.788 --> 15:58.758
He just wanted
to keep you safe.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.693
No, he wanted the candy.
I was just the beard.

16:01.727 --> 16:04.964
Oh, that's not true, actually.
The candy was for me.

16:04.998 --> 16:08.634
Your father loved
spending time with you.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.770
Not enough, I guess.

16:11.803 --> 16:13.972
Buffy.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.611
Oh, that just paved right over
memory lane, huh?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.813
You know the divorce
had nothing to do with you.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.515
I don't know.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.620
I'm starting to feel
like there's a pattern here.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.625
Open your heart to someone,
and he bails on you.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.328
Maybe it's easier
to just not let anyone in.

16:36.363 --> 16:40.633
I thought it might be easier.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.635
You must've noticed that I'm not
exactly the social butterfly

16:43.669 --> 16:46.572
that I was when
I was with your dad.

16:46.605 --> 16:49.008
I don't think I made
a single new friend

16:49.042 --> 16:51.977
the year we moved to Sunnydale.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.245
Why not?

16:53.279 --> 16:55.381
Fear.

16:57.015 --> 16:59.851
I didn't believe I could
trust anyone again.

16:59.885 --> 17:02.554
It's taken time
and a lot of effort,

17:02.589 --> 17:04.589
but I've got a nice
circle of friends now.

17:06.759 --> 17:10.596
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm,
I-I'm still a little gun-shy.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.566
It certainly didn't help
that my last boyfriend

17:13.598 --> 17:15.567
turned out to be
a homicidal robot.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.771
I will always be here for you,

17:20.807 --> 17:23.476
and you've got Mr. Giles
and your friends.

17:25.644 --> 17:29.148
Believe me, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

17:32.118 --> 17:36.288
* Ow...

17:36.323 --> 17:39.459
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

17:45.897 --> 17:48.201
WILLOW:
No. I'll just meet you
at your place.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.703
Yeah, Buffy said she was coming,
but I haven't seen her.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.940
We have to make sure
she has fun.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.742
We have to force fun upon her.

17:56.776 --> 18:00.813
Yeah, and if Parker shows up,
we'll just ax-murder him.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.148
That's Halloweeny.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.284
Okay. See you in a bit.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.826
Willow, you got
to stop by the room.

18:13.859 --> 18:17.196
I'm late for battle or I would.
I love your outfit, though.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.467
Yeah.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.670
There's nothing
going on here.

18:23.702 --> 18:25.104
I saw you
flirting with her.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.772
Do we have to do this
every time?

18:26.806 --> 18:29.409
Look, I love you.
You know that.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.777
(spooky noises)

18:36.715 --> 18:39.251
Okay, Rach, what's in
the next one?

18:39.286 --> 18:41.354
You guys are sick.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.855
Here. Give me your hand.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.458
This is gross.

18:45.491 --> 18:48.627
Eyeballs, Rachel.
They're eyeballs.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.663
(snickers)
(evil chuckle)

18:55.000 --> 18:56.903
(screams)

19:00.173 --> 19:01.508
Hey, Red.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.009
What you got in the
basket, little girl?

19:04.042 --> 19:05.478
Weapons.

19:05.511 --> 19:08.013
Oh.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.882
Just in case.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.018
Like the tux, Xander.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.287
Bond. James Bond.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.954
Insurance. You know,
in case we get turned

19:15.988 --> 19:17.457
into our costumes again,

19:17.490 --> 19:19.858
I'm going for a cool
secret agent guy.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.528
I hate to
break it to you,

19:21.560 --> 19:23.863
but you'll probably end up
cool Head Waiter guy.

19:23.895 --> 19:26.865
As long as I'm cool and
wield some kind of power.

19:26.898 --> 19:28.968
Will. Medieval Will.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.837
XANDER:
Hail, ye olde... varletty...

19:31.871 --> 19:32.971
thou.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.207
I-I'm Joan of Arc.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.907
I figured we had
a lot in common,

19:35.942 --> 19:38.877
seeing as how I was almost
burned at the stake,

19:38.911 --> 19:42.481
and plus she had that
close relationship with God.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.284
And you are?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.488
Of course.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.557
I wish I'd thought of that

19:50.589 --> 19:51.891
before I put
down my deposit.

19:51.923 --> 19:54.260
I could have been God.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.927
Blasphemer.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.006
Nice costumes.

20:07.038 --> 20:08.674
Very stealthy.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.710
What are they
supposed to be?

20:10.742 --> 20:12.878
NATO?

20:12.912 --> 20:16.548
Oh, yeah. I invited
Anya to join us,

20:16.583 --> 20:19.352
but she's having some trouble
finding a scary costume,

20:19.385 --> 20:21.587
so she's just gonna
meet us there.

20:21.621 --> 20:25.023
Perfect. Everybody's got a date
but third-wheel Buffy.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.692
You're not
a third wheel.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.728
Technically speaking,
you're a fifth wheel.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.633
We're gonna have
the best time.

20:35.166 --> 20:39.005
(screaming)

20:47.246 --> 20:49.682
Aah! Oh, God!

21:02.528 --> 21:05.432
(screaming)

21:09.602 --> 21:11.269
Let the horrors begin.

21:15.106 --> 21:18.044
God, help me.

21:24.616 --> 21:28.555
DEMONIC VOICE:
Release me.

21:35.561 --> 21:39.598
(spooky sound effects)

21:39.632 --> 21:41.601
The joint's not jumping.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.103
Where is everybody?

21:44.135 --> 21:45.637
Follow the signs.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.542
Terrifying.

21:50.576 --> 21:54.279
If I were Abbott and Costello,
this would be fairly traumatic.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.915
(spooky sound effects continue)

22:01.053 --> 22:03.823
Ew! Aah! Cobweb!

22:03.855 --> 22:06.358
Okay, that part
was realistic.

22:06.393 --> 22:09.228
Well, frat boys aren't too
obsessive with their cleaning.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.998
Might not be decoration, per se.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.099
Aah!
(cackling)

22:15.334 --> 22:17.470
(panting):
I wasn't scared.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.805
I was in the spirit.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.239
And we'll back
you up on that,

22:20.271 --> 22:21.874
even if they question
us separately.

22:24.175 --> 22:25.377
Aah!

22:25.412 --> 22:27.278
Ew! Get it off!

22:28.414 --> 22:30.215
It's gone.

22:30.249 --> 22:33.219
Okay, that is not sanitary.

22:33.251 --> 22:36.055
You know, let's get to the party
part of the... party.

22:36.087 --> 22:39.025
Yeah. Are you sure
it's off me?

22:39.057 --> 22:40.358
Yeah.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.862
(spooky sound effects continue)

22:47.599 --> 22:49.568
I thought this led to...

22:49.602 --> 22:50.603
What is it?

22:51.703 --> 22:53.172
Blood.

22:53.204 --> 22:56.041
(sniffs)
Real blood.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.546
Okay, actual creeps
have been given.
Bravo, frat boys.

22:59.578 --> 23:02.949
Shh! Do you
hear something?

23:02.981 --> 23:05.284
Like a squeaking noise?

23:05.317 --> 23:06.952
Oh, it's these rented shoes.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.119
Patent leather.
I asked the guy to...

23:08.153 --> 23:10.088
No, no, no, wait.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.090
I-- It's something else.
I hear it, too.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.960
It's something like...

23:17.463 --> 23:18.964
(all scream)

23:31.577 --> 23:33.546
Oz, don't.
It might be...

23:33.579 --> 23:34.881
Rubber.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.383
It's made of rubber.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.085
What the hell
is going on here?

23:39.117 --> 23:42.087
Look, maybe it's nothing.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.123
Maybe it's just a neat trick.

23:44.155 --> 23:46.125
You know, something done
with wires or...

23:46.157 --> 23:49.461
DEMONIC VOICE:
Release me!

23:49.496 --> 23:52.330
Or it might be
something else.

24:09.381 --> 24:11.383
Where's the door?

24:20.226 --> 24:22.494
Hey! Hello!

24:39.244 --> 24:42.147
WOMAN:
Aah! Help me!

24:42.181 --> 24:43.650
Help me, please!

24:43.682 --> 24:47.219
(screams)

24:49.020 --> 24:50.823
Xander.

24:50.856 --> 24:54.326
(spooky sound effects continue)

24:54.359 --> 24:56.127
Where's the stairs?

24:56.162 --> 24:58.163
Where's the door?

24:58.197 --> 25:00.298
This is the way
we came in, right?

25:00.332 --> 25:01.834
We just went in a circle.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.035
(spooky sound effects shut off)

25:03.068 --> 25:05.070
Thank the Lord.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.538
You're welcome.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.840
Hey, I have a neat idea.
Let's get out of here.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.843
And you were so anxious
for me to come.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.979
I'm serious, Buffy.
We don't know what
we're dealing with.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.313
Okay, my turn.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.481
Does anyone hear that?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.049
Well, as soon as we start
dealing with it,

25:18.084 --> 25:19.586
I'll know what it is
I'm dealing with.

25:19.618 --> 25:20.920
Do you hear something?

25:20.952 --> 25:24.824
Like I said, sounds
like a hissing.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.993
It's like a "sss" noise?

25:28.027 --> 25:29.729
I thought the
word "hissing"

25:29.761 --> 25:31.798
kind of covered
that nicely.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.438
Oh, God.

25:39.471 --> 25:42.540
I'm sorry.
I didn't know. Sorry.

25:42.575 --> 25:43.843
Chaz.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.443
Didn't know.

25:45.477 --> 25:46.778
What's happening?

25:46.813 --> 25:48.647
It, uh...

25:50.082 --> 25:51.182
What is it?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.618
It's alive.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.086
It's alive.

26:15.473 --> 26:16.742
What's alive?

26:19.746 --> 26:21.313
He's in shock.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.214
Chaz, what happened here?

26:23.249 --> 26:24.583
Aah! Aah!

26:32.290 --> 26:34.059
I think the cape
took most of it.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.060
Let me see.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.394
It could need stitches.

26:36.427 --> 26:38.396
Should at least get
a bandage or something.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.599
(woman screaming)

26:46.337 --> 26:50.009
Cowering in a closet is starting
to seem like a reasonable plan.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.278
What closet?

26:55.547 --> 26:56.982
I'm gonna make my way upstairs

26:57.016 --> 26:58.851
and see if there are
any people up there.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.686
You guys find a way out
of the house and use it.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.222
You're telling us to run away
and leave you behind?

27:05.223 --> 27:07.026
We need help.

27:07.058 --> 27:09.996
We need the only person that can
make sense of what's happening.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.301
(knock on door)

27:16.335 --> 27:19.270
Oh... just a minute.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.638
Coming.

27:23.409 --> 27:24.977
Happy Hal...
Xander's in trouble.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.144
You've got to do
something right now.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.713
Anya.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.316
Are you listening?
Xander's trapped.

27:30.348 --> 27:32.785
Uh, where's Buffy
and the others?

27:32.818 --> 27:35.221
Oh, they're trapped, too,
but we've got to save Xander.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.789
Slow down. I need you
to be more specific.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.893
All right, um, we were supposed
to meet at this house,

27:40.926 --> 27:43.829
and I got there, and there was
no door where a door should be,

27:43.863 --> 27:45.396
and then I see this girl
standing in a window,

27:45.431 --> 27:47.066
and then-- poof-- she's gone.

27:47.098 --> 27:48.500
She vanished
from the window?

27:48.534 --> 27:49.836
No. The window vanished
from the house.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.805
Hmm. Matter and reality
distortion.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.507
Like a summoning spell's
temporal flux.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.308
What?

27:57.343 --> 28:01.780
Hmm? Oh, never mind. I just need
to get some supplies together.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.318
I wouldn't worry about Xander.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.654
At least he's amongst friends.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.856
Will, I'm telling you...

28:10.890 --> 28:12.191
Telling me?
You're telling me?

28:12.223 --> 28:13.358
I can't do my job
if I have

28:13.392 --> 28:14.359
to worry about each
of your safety.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.693
It's not your decision.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.096
Got to disagree with you there.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.430
Oh, of course you do.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.398
Let's all take a breath.
Buffy, maybe...

28:20.432 --> 28:23.035
Being the slayer doesn't
automatically make you boss.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.203
You're as lost
as the rest of us.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.073
All right, what are
we talking about?

28:27.105 --> 28:28.707
It's a simple incantation.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.342
A guiding spell
for travelers

28:30.375 --> 28:31.911
when they become
lost or disoriented.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.378
And how's it work?

28:33.412 --> 28:35.181
It conjures an emissary
from the beyond

28:35.213 --> 28:37.884
that lights the way.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.586
Conjuring. Will,
let's be realistic here.

28:40.618 --> 28:43.588
Okay, your basic spells are
usually only about fifty-fifty.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.457
Oh, yeah?

28:45.490 --> 28:48.961
Well... so's your face.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.163
What?

28:52.163 --> 28:54.232
What does that mean?

28:54.266 --> 28:56.301
I'm not your sidekick.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.702
Will, hang on.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.737
(sighs)

29:00.638 --> 29:03.275
Well, that was
a bunch of laughs.

29:03.308 --> 29:07.145
Look, Buffy, we're all
tired and a little edgy.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.381
Maybe Willow's overreacting.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.049
I'm sure part of it's
because of how

29:11.083 --> 29:12.651
you've been
pushing-away girl lately.

29:12.683 --> 29:16.055
But now is not the time
to let that stuff tear us apart.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.958
What I'm saying is,
is I'm right with you,

29:18.990 --> 29:19.959
right by your side.

29:19.991 --> 29:22.060
Xander?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.895
Funny how you still
haven't lost your sense

29:23.930 --> 29:25.631
of inappropriate humor.

29:25.663 --> 29:28.267
Xander, where did you go?

29:28.299 --> 29:29.734
Buffy, knock it off.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.303
Skit's over.
I'm right here.

29:31.336 --> 29:33.305
This is so typical of him.

29:33.338 --> 29:34.973
Typical?

29:35.007 --> 29:36.241
Xander!

29:36.275 --> 29:38.344
Buffy!

29:49.055 --> 29:50.556
Buff?

30:06.172 --> 30:09.040
WILLOW:
She thinks I'm not ready
to be a full-blown witch.

30:09.075 --> 30:12.211
I can handle the dark forces
as good as anyone else.

30:12.243 --> 30:15.346
It's not that hard.
It's just a guiding spell.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.348
And I'm careful and all.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.684
This floor used
to have windows.

30:19.718 --> 30:22.721
Look, we found the stairs.

30:25.090 --> 30:28.160
Buffy didn't find
the stairs. No, sir.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.896
I don't think you guys
are thinking clearly.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.472
We just need to get up to the
goat room, and maybe we can f...

30:41.507 --> 30:43.375
Will, something's
happening.

30:43.409 --> 30:44.410
Something good?

30:44.442 --> 30:45.576
(growling)

30:47.613 --> 30:50.715
Oh, no... not good.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.551
I'm changing.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.755
But-- but you can't.
There's no moon tonight.

30:56.788 --> 30:58.490
I have to get away.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.326
No. We need to find something
to restrain you--

31:01.359 --> 31:03.694
like a rope or chains
or something.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.530
There's no time.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.934
I can do the guiding spell.
I know I can make it work.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.236
Will, please.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.436
No.
No!

31:11.470 --> 31:12.403
Ow!

31:15.307 --> 31:16.575
Oz.

31:17.742 --> 31:19.778
Oz, don't leave me!

31:19.810 --> 31:21.747
(echoing):
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

31:21.779 --> 31:23.915
Don't leave me! Don't leave me!

31:31.289 --> 31:32.691
There I am.

31:32.723 --> 31:34.692
I didn't go anywhere. Great.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.561
Now I just got to live
with the fact

31:36.595 --> 31:38.430
that no one else can see me.

31:38.463 --> 31:39.999
I can see you.

31:41.599 --> 31:43.234
(groaning)

31:45.636 --> 31:47.973
OZ:
You're not gonna change.
You're not gonna change.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.740
You're not
gonna change.

31:49.775 --> 31:52.478
You're not gonna change.
You're not gonna change.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.079
You're not
gonna change.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.781
You're not gonna change.
You're not gonna change.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.384
You're not
gonna change.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.919
You're not gonna change.
You're not gonna change.

32:00.952 --> 32:02.954
You're not gonna change.

32:21.873 --> 32:27.278
Okay, okay.
Aradia, Goddess of the Lost,

32:27.313 --> 32:29.480
the path is murky.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.615
The woods are dense.

32:30.648 --> 32:32.984
Darkness pervades.

32:33.019 --> 32:37.222
I beseech thee...
bring the light.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.193
Whoa. Hey, I did it.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.730
I did you. Hi.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.201
Right, you're-you're waiting
for instructions.

32:49.234 --> 32:52.304
Lead me to Oz.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.674
Wait. I should try
to find the people

32:56.708 --> 32:58.609
trapped upstairs first.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.311
But even if I get them,

33:00.346 --> 33:01.980
we still have to find a way
out of the house.

33:02.013 --> 33:04.615
Okay, here's what we should do.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.219
Hey, what's going on?

33:07.252 --> 33:09.121
Stop!

33:09.154 --> 33:11.190
Stop it!

33:11.222 --> 33:12.357
(buzzing)

33:12.391 --> 33:14.660
(gasps)
Get off!

33:17.663 --> 33:19.897
Oz! Hel...

33:19.931 --> 33:22.268
(coughing)

33:29.007 --> 33:32.310
WILLOW:
Help! Help me, Oz!

33:32.344 --> 33:34.512
Someone, help!

33:40.551 --> 33:43.189
Help!

33:43.221 --> 33:45.191
BUFFY:
Willow.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.700
Oh!

34:13.652 --> 34:15.353
Basement.

34:15.387 --> 34:19.257
I must be in the... basement.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.260
MAN:
All alone.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.663
Who said... that?

34:27.398 --> 34:30.101
They all ran away from you.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.438
They always will.

34:32.471 --> 34:36.141
Open your heart
to someone and...

34:39.177 --> 34:41.079
But don't fret, little girl.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.782
You're not alone.

34:43.815 --> 34:44.815
Aah!

34:48.152 --> 34:49.188
Anymore.

34:55.626 --> 34:58.429
(Buffy screaming,
creatures moaning)

35:14.213 --> 35:15.646
Well?

35:17.983 --> 35:20.219
We're gonna have
to create a door.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.889
Create a door?
You can do that?

35:25.956 --> 35:26.992
I can.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.027
(chain saw buzzing)

35:35.400 --> 35:36.702
(screaming continues)

35:39.471 --> 35:41.106
No matter
how hard you fight,

35:41.139 --> 35:43.708
you just end up
in the same place.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.054
I don't see why you bother.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.407
I'm upstairs.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.507
(people whimpering)

36:16.541 --> 36:18.210
The goat room.

36:32.391 --> 36:35.393
(all whimpering)

36:43.702 --> 36:45.503
Oz?

36:45.536 --> 36:48.039
Get 'em off me. Get 'em off me.
Get' em off.

36:48.072 --> 36:49.840
Get off.
Get 'em off.

36:49.875 --> 36:53.177
Willow. Willow, Willow,
what's wrong?

36:53.210 --> 36:54.445
Couldn't get 'em off.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.947
Couldn't...
It's okay.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.548
It's okay. It's okay.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.550
We're okay.

36:59.585 --> 37:02.954
We're not okay.
We need to get out of here.

37:02.987 --> 37:04.222
I'd offer my opinion,
but you jerks

37:04.255 --> 37:05.923
aren't gonna hear it,
anyway.

37:05.956 --> 37:07.259
Not that
didn't-go-to-college boy

37:07.293 --> 37:08.693
has anything important
to say.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.728
I might as well hang out
with my new best friend,

37:10.762 --> 37:12.130
bleeding dummy head,

37:12.163 --> 37:14.199
for all you dorks care.
What is wrong with you?

37:14.231 --> 37:16.967
You... you heard that?

37:17.001 --> 37:19.438
You can see me?

37:19.471 --> 37:21.440
Good.

37:21.472 --> 37:23.409
Oh, God, good.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.443
The house separated us.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.612
Like it wanted to scare us.

37:26.644 --> 37:29.146
But we got away.

37:29.179 --> 37:32.250
No. We were brought here.

37:32.284 --> 37:37.255
We all got so scared
that we ended up... here.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.157
Why?

37:41.293 --> 37:43.461
I saw them painting that.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.233
They were copying out of...

37:49.266 --> 37:50.668
that.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.905
I think it's Gaelic.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.273
Can you translate?

37:56.307 --> 38:00.512
DEMONIC VOICE:
Release me!

38:00.545 --> 38:02.313
(echoing): Release me!

38:02.347 --> 38:04.148
Will, give me something.

38:04.181 --> 38:08.085
Okay, um, the icon's called
the-the Mark of Gachnar.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.454
I-I think this is a,

38:09.487 --> 38:12.590
a summoning spell
for something called...

38:12.623 --> 38:13.692
Gachnar?

38:13.724 --> 38:16.494
Yes. Somehow, the-the
beginning of the spell

38:16.527 --> 38:18.597
must have been
triggered.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.867
Um, Gachnar's trying to manifest
itself, to come into being.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.101
How?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.670
It-it feeds on fear.

38:25.704 --> 38:29.474
Our fears are manifesting.
We're feeding it.

38:29.507 --> 38:31.009
We need to stop.

38:31.041 --> 38:33.143
If we close our eyes
and say it's a dream,

38:33.177 --> 38:35.012
it'll stab us to death.

38:35.045 --> 38:36.847
These things are real.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.550
Okay, so our fears
are feeding it.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.018
If we get everyone
out of here...

38:40.050 --> 38:41.887
(loud banging,
demonic voices screaming)

38:44.523 --> 38:46.190
Good plan. Let's go.

38:47.693 --> 38:48.726
(shrieks)

38:52.697 --> 38:54.699
Giles?

38:54.733 --> 38:56.568
Hey, everyone,
it's Giles...

38:56.601 --> 38:57.702
with a chain saw.

38:57.735 --> 38:58.704
Xander.

38:58.737 --> 38:59.871
Glad you could make it.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.608
The walls closed up
behind us.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.045
Gachnar. Of course.

39:07.077 --> 39:10.181
Its presence infects
the reality of the house,

39:10.215 --> 39:12.518
but it's not managed
to achieve full manifestation.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.719
We cannot allow this
to come into being.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.722
But if it does,
I can fight it, right?

39:16.755 --> 39:19.557
Buffy...

39:19.590 --> 39:21.059
this is Gachnar.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.893
BUFFY:
I don't want to fight that.

39:22.927 --> 39:24.996
So we break the spell.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.097
Whatever we do,
let's do it fast.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.532
I have it, I have it.

39:27.565 --> 39:29.601
Um, "the summoning spell
for Gachnar

39:29.635 --> 39:31.570
"can be shut down
in one of two ways.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.204
Destroying the Mark
of Gachnar..."

39:41.880 --> 39:44.282
"...is not one of them
and will, in fact, immediately

39:44.315 --> 39:46.684
bring forth the
fear demon itself."

39:46.717 --> 39:48.619
(rumbling)

39:50.956 --> 39:52.389
WILLOW:
Look.

39:58.295 --> 40:00.565
(roaring)

40:25.791 --> 40:27.626
This is Gachnar?

40:27.659 --> 40:29.126
XANDER:
Big overture...

40:29.159 --> 40:31.630
little show.

40:31.663 --> 40:36.568
I am the dark lord
of nightmares.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.403
The bringer of terror.

40:39.436 --> 40:42.574
Tremble before me.

40:42.608 --> 40:45.643
Fear me.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.244
He...

40:47.277 --> 40:48.980
he's so cute.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.081
Tremble.
Who's the little
fear demon?

40:51.115 --> 40:54.686
Come on, who's
the little fear demon?

40:54.719 --> 40:56.655
I bring the terror.
Don't taunt the fear demon.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.155
Why? Can he hurt me?

40:58.188 --> 40:59.824
No. It's just... tacky.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.259
I bring the fear.
Be that as it may,

41:01.291 --> 41:02.793
Buffy, when it
comes to slaying...

41:02.827 --> 41:04.362
Size doesn't matter?

41:04.394 --> 41:07.331
They're all going
to abandon you, you know.

41:07.364 --> 41:09.166
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.036
(squish)

41:12.070 --> 41:14.840
Some quality
treats here, Giles.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.373
Please finish them.

41:16.407 --> 41:18.376
This is much better.

41:18.409 --> 41:21.311
There is no problem that
cannot be solved by chocolate.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.014
I think I'm gonna barf.

41:23.047 --> 41:24.382
Except that.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.255
What?

41:32.858 --> 41:35.492
That's your scary costume?

41:35.527 --> 41:37.494
Bunnies frighten me.

41:37.528 --> 41:40.065
GILES:
Oh, bloody hell.
The inscription.

41:40.097 --> 41:41.699
BUFFY:
What's the matter?

41:41.733 --> 41:45.503
I should've translated
the Gaelic inscription

41:45.536 --> 41:48.373
under the illustration
of Gachnar.

41:48.405 --> 41:50.175
BUFFY:
What's it say?

41:50.208 --> 41:52.110
"Actual size."

42:32.282 --> 42:34.652
Grr. Argh.
