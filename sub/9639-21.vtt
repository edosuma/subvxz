WEBVTT

00:10.027 --> 00:12.383
Yo, happy-go-trashy, come back here.

00:13.989 --> 00:15.388
Don't you see me sweeping?

00:15.509 --> 00:17.705
What would your mother say
if she saw you do that, huh?

00:18.551 --> 00:21.271
Mama would be mad.

00:21.752 --> 00:24.347
That's right, Mama would be mad,
and so am I.

00:24.473 --> 00:25.668
Now pick that up.

00:26.954 --> 00:29.105
And that cup too.

00:29.876 --> 00:32.710
Okay, thank you for eating
at Waverly Sub Station. Come again.

00:34.037 --> 00:35.312
Hey, Alex.

00:37.759 --> 00:40.558
You picked up the trash on the way here.
Just throw it in the can.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.320
No, silly.
This is a necklace I designed for you.

00:43.441 --> 00:45.751
A little something to say thanks
for being my best friend.

00:47.803 --> 00:49.283
No, I'm not wearing that.

00:49.724 --> 00:51.283
Why not?

00:51.405 --> 00:54.364
Well, because it's so beautiful

00:54.486 --> 00:57.958
and you should sell it.

00:58.128 --> 00:59.720
Okay. That will be $35.

00:59.849 --> 01:01.123
No.

01:01.809 --> 01:04.119
I meant on Waverly Place,
like these guys.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.685
Okay, and whatever we don't sell,
we can wear to school.

01:07.092 --> 01:08.127
School? Okay.

01:08.252 --> 01:10.448
Big jewellery sale this Saturday.
Please don't miss it.

01:10.573 --> 01:11.643
Please. Happy-go-trashy.

01:11.774 --> 01:14.243
Buy your mama something nice. No?

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.279 --> 02:15.115
So you kids are telling the Babe
that hot dogs is bad for you?

02:15.241 --> 02:17.153
What's a fella eat for breakfast?

02:17.282 --> 02:19.478
Beef jerky and a bowl of syrup.

02:19.603 --> 02:23.837
I call it beef jerky and a bowl of syrup.

02:25.766 --> 02:28.201
Alex, put him back in the picture
before Dad gets here.

02:28.327 --> 02:32.241
Oh, lighten up. If he was Obi-Wan Kenobi,
you'd be all into it.

02:33.089 --> 02:36.048
Life-size Obi-Wan? I'll be right back.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.885
Sit down.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.441
Hi.

02:42.213 --> 02:45.286
Alex, what did we say
about taking people out of pictures?

02:46.215 --> 02:50.927
We say, "Yay, hooray,
Alex is so fun and creative."

02:52.537 --> 02:55.895
Babe, always a pleasure.
I am a big fan.

02:56.019 --> 02:57.532
Now put him back in the picture.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.099
Fine.

03:01.541 --> 03:03.692
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your place...</i>

03:03.822 --> 03:05.939
Oh, I don't know the rest.

03:06.783 --> 03:09.618
You need to know the exact time
and place to finish the spell.

03:10.105 --> 03:12.745
I need to know stuff?
Justin's department.

03:13.146 --> 03:15.103
Yankee Stadium, 1929.

03:16.027 --> 03:18.258
You even make sports
not sound cool.

03:20.229 --> 03:21.982
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places</i>

03:22.110 --> 03:23.669
<i>Yankee Stadium, 1929</i>

03:27.192 --> 03:28.592
Okay.

03:28.713 --> 03:33.152
Now, today's lesson is about making
an object pass through something solid.

03:33.315 --> 03:37.788
Justin, say "go through, mow through"
on my hockey stick.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.397
Okay.

03:40.478 --> 03:42.435
<i>Go through, mow through</i>

03:42.599 --> 03:44.909
Okay. Now my hockey stick is charmed.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.838
Watch.

03:49.602 --> 03:51.355
It tickles. Stop, stop.

03:51.483 --> 03:52.836
Awesome. Let me try.

03:56.005 --> 03:57.643
Alex.

03:58.006 --> 03:59.837
Not the spleen. Not my spleen.

04:07.170 --> 04:10.243
Miss Russo, we have a problem.
I'd like a word, please.

04:10.411 --> 04:12.448
Sure, Miss Marinovich.
How about the word "lunch"?

04:12.572 --> 04:14.723
I know it's one of my favourites.

04:15.373 --> 04:19.050
You haven't signed up for Saturday's
art history field trip to the museum.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.930
And if you don't go, you're gonna
have to repeat my class this summer.

04:23.056 --> 04:24.285
And I'm begging you,

04:24.417 --> 04:27.933
please don't make me teach a class
with just you in it.

04:28.259 --> 04:32.253
Oh, believe me, summer school
is not part of my plans.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.814
And neither is the museum.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.773
I'm actually going
to a different art exhibit.

04:35.902 --> 04:38.258
My friend Harper is making jewellery,
and we're selling it.

04:38.383 --> 04:43.015
If you like macaroni and glitter,
I can get you some awesome earrings.

04:43.145 --> 04:46.617
But the field trip is worth 30 percent
of your grade.

04:47.467 --> 04:50.585
Please, I'm on my knees. Don't fail.

04:51.229 --> 04:52.947
I missed my math field trip
last Saturday.

04:53.069 --> 04:55.061
So 30 percent, is that a lot?

04:55.190 --> 04:56.226
It's a lot.

04:57.111 --> 05:01.709
Listen. I need you to watch Alex
and make sure I get my summer vacation.

05:02.073 --> 05:04.304
I will see to it that she's
at the museum on Saturday.

05:04.474 --> 05:05.828
Thank you.

05:10.037 --> 05:12.757
When you said "she," I really hope
you didn't mean me, because:

05:19.481 --> 05:21.518
He sees Russo.

05:23.002 --> 05:25.312
Oh, I'm open. I'm open.

05:31.926 --> 05:34.122
What are you gonna tell your mother?

05:35.848 --> 05:37.646
All right. I know how to deal with this.

05:39.049 --> 05:42.088
We'll mess up a bunch of other stuff
and say we were robbed.

05:43.731 --> 05:44.801
What happened?

05:45.692 --> 05:47.445
My lamp.

05:48.053 --> 05:49.806
We were throwing the ball.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.891
What happened to the robbery?

05:52.255 --> 05:54.292
We didn't have time to mess stuff up.

05:54.416 --> 05:57.966
How many times have I said, no throwing
the ball inside the house, guys?

05:58.097 --> 06:00.818
- How many lamps have we broken?
- Three.

06:00.939 --> 06:03.056
At least three times.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.861
- We're sorry.
- Oh, not yet you're not.

06:06.981 --> 06:09.018
After I get a massage and a pedicure

06:09.182 --> 06:13.621
and whatever else I want that I don't need,
then you'll be sorry.

06:14.144 --> 06:15.373
Man, this is bogus.

06:15.505 --> 06:19.261
What's the point of having a foam football
if it still breaks stuff?

06:19.387 --> 06:20.456
Exactly.

06:20.587 --> 06:24.059
You know, someone should just come up
with a ball that could fly through stuff.

06:25.029 --> 06:27.624
And I think that someone is us, huh?

06:29.511 --> 06:32.265
I don't know why we're nodding.

06:33.233 --> 06:34.985
Go through, mow through.

06:35.113 --> 06:38.027
Oh, now I get why we're nodding.

06:38.195 --> 06:40.232
Okay. That's enough nodding.

06:41.156 --> 06:43.387
- Okay.
- Here.

06:44.798 --> 06:46.629
<i>Go through, mow through</i>

06:46.759 --> 06:48.909
All right, let's give it a try.
Hey, go out the door.

06:54.082 --> 06:55.231
Here it comes.

06:55.962 --> 06:57.362
Sweet. It works.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.841
Okay. Pass it back.

07:02.925 --> 07:04.644
I got it.

07:07.888 --> 07:10.687
Yeah, it's just the football, Max.
Not you.

07:24.415 --> 07:26.007
Hello, Miss Marinovich.

07:26.136 --> 07:28.970
Mr. Kiss-Up-Ovich.

07:29.097 --> 07:31.293
I'm here as you can plainly see.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.614
No getting around the fact that I'm here.

07:33.739 --> 07:36.129
Feel free to put a little check by my name
because I'm here.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.135
Now, I'll be way over there
and you might not see me for a while,

07:39.301 --> 07:43.455
because I'll be deep inside the museum,
soaking it all in.

07:44.103 --> 07:47.461
I don't care what you soak in
as long as you pass my class

07:47.585 --> 07:49.975
and we're not staring
at each other in summer school.

07:50.106 --> 07:52.780
Because this is how I stare:

08:03.712 --> 08:06.352
<i>Go through, mow through</i>

08:10.595 --> 08:13.588
Okay, everyone, make sure
you get one of these handouts.

08:13.716 --> 08:15.435
You have to fill it with historical facts.

08:15.557 --> 08:18.470
It's worth 30 percent of your grade.

08:18.838 --> 08:20.670
Alex?

08:20.799 --> 08:22.631
Alex?

08:23.480 --> 08:25.631
Alex.

08:27.922 --> 08:30.642
Oh, good, you're here.
Now we can open for business.

08:36.486 --> 08:38.636
Harper, I don't think we need
to say homemade.

08:38.767 --> 08:41.202
People will just know.

08:41.328 --> 08:44.241
Wait a minute,
is this the knob from my dresser?

08:47.411 --> 08:49.129
Oh, here comes our first customer.

08:49.251 --> 08:51.767
Already? Oh, this will be easy.

08:51.893 --> 08:52.962
Good morning, ma'am.

08:53.093 --> 08:55.130
Morning. Can I take all this?

08:55.774 --> 08:58.084
- All of it?
- Yeah, I'll take it all.

08:58.696 --> 09:00.095
That'd be great.

09:00.216 --> 09:02.367
Hey, Ralph. Bring the truck.

09:02.497 --> 09:04.614
We got a load of trash over here.

09:05.298 --> 09:07.051
What? No, this isn't trash.

09:07.219 --> 09:08.812
It's fine jewellery.

09:09.220 --> 09:10.813
Really?

09:10.981 --> 09:12.380
Hey, Ralph.

09:12.502 --> 09:17.180
Did you know we've been driving around
in a jewellery store?

09:23.506 --> 09:25.816
Oh, good job, by the way, in there.

09:27.468 --> 09:30.063
Next time, don't use red pen.
I use red pen when I grade.

09:30.189 --> 09:32.260
That's kind of why I became
a teacher's assistant.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.753
Hey, that was some great art.

09:48.877 --> 09:51.153
Hard to pick a favourite.
It was all so great.

09:51.318 --> 09:52.798
Save it, ditcher.

09:53.239 --> 09:54.389
Ditcher?

09:54.520 --> 09:57.991
Yeah. You ditched, I'm calling you
a ditcher. Got a problem?

09:59.522 --> 10:01.354
There's only one tiny flaw
with your plan,

10:01.483 --> 10:03.235
and it's called a worksheet.

10:06.725 --> 10:07.760
A worksheet?

10:07.885 --> 10:10.720
I'd hurry, because the museum closes
in like five minutes.

10:12.007 --> 10:14.158
Five minutes.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.370
Five minutes?
I wouldn't know this stuff in five hours.

10:23.452 --> 10:25.569
But they might.

10:39.579 --> 10:42.572
<i>Frames with figures
Step out of your pictures</i>

10:47.062 --> 10:49.179
Okay. Gather around, people.

10:49.303 --> 10:51.499
Gather around. Over here.

10:54.906 --> 10:56.579
Why are you doing that?

10:56.707 --> 10:58.743
<i>He's The Scream.</i>

10:59.988 --> 11:02.583
Well, I got a new nickname for you.
It's Quiet Guy, okay?

11:04.070 --> 11:05.822
All right,
I'm gonna skip the introductions,

11:05.951 --> 11:08.466
because I gotta fill out this worksheet
and blast out of here.

11:08.592 --> 11:12.302
So, which one of you is
the Dutch boy wearing a blue costume?

11:12.433 --> 11:14.345
That would be me.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.544
Oh, okay.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.871
And the name of your painting is?

11:18.316 --> 11:19.669
<i>Blue Boy.</i>

11:20.477 --> 11:22.196
This is gonna be easy.

11:22.318 --> 11:27.110
<i>All right, Frowning Woman, Crazy Guy,
Guy With One Ear.</i>

11:28.720 --> 11:29.915
See that?

11:30.041 --> 11:31.760
She's just going to use us.

11:31.882 --> 11:33.395
And then send us right back

11:33.522 --> 11:38.918
into those dingy, stiff, boring paintings
for who knows how many more centuries.

11:39.045 --> 11:41.765
I say we take a vacation.

11:43.767 --> 11:45.440
Wait. Fine, fine.

11:45.568 --> 11:47.560
If you're not gonna help me
with my worksheet,

11:47.689 --> 11:50.284
then you're just all going back
where you came from.

11:50.450 --> 11:51.565
Go.

11:51.690 --> 11:53.568
I'm done taking short-cuts.

11:53.691 --> 11:56.650
I'm gonna do it the hard way.
I'm gonna copy off Nellie Rodriguez.

11:59.574 --> 12:01.645
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places...</i>

12:01.775 --> 12:03.288
Wait. I don't know where you're from.

12:05.416 --> 12:09.172
<i>Attention.
We will be closing in five minutes.</i>

12:10.338 --> 12:11.692
Okay, don't panic.

12:15.261 --> 12:16.660
Go ahead, Scream, panic.

12:23.544 --> 12:26.423
Come on, you guys.
We're locked in a museum.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.696
Let's have a slumber party.

12:28.826 --> 12:30.499
And, you know, get to know each other.

12:30.627 --> 12:33.780
I'll tell you about myself
and you tell me about yourself.

12:33.909 --> 12:35.422
For example, I'm Alex.

12:35.549 --> 12:38.987
I was made in 1992 in New York City.
Where were you made?

12:39.551 --> 12:42.989
You talk so much,
I'm glad my ear's gone.

12:43.113 --> 12:45.992
Cheese it. Elaine's coming.

12:47.835 --> 12:48.904
Who's Elaine?

12:49.035 --> 12:51.504
She's the security guard
always shining her light in our eyes.

12:52.637 --> 12:54.150
Hide.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.780
Man, it's like her eyes follow you.

13:52.663 --> 13:55.701
Okay, we are closed.
You know what that means.

13:56.264 --> 13:59.302
Pull the plastic utensils out of the trash
and wash them?

14:00.946 --> 14:03.017
Already done.

14:04.108 --> 14:05.780
Now it's kick-off time.

14:06.188 --> 14:07.508
I'm going long.

14:12.951 --> 14:14.021
Nice one.

14:14.152 --> 14:17.384
Now, you go long,
and by long, I mean up.

14:17.513 --> 14:19.152
Oh, nice.

14:19.274 --> 14:20.549
Hut, hut.

14:26.717 --> 14:28.276
Oh, hi, Max.

14:31.439 --> 14:33.112
No.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.799
- What?
- Hey, Maxy.

14:35.921 --> 14:38.038
Did you catch the...?

14:38.162 --> 14:39.915
Flu?

14:41.084 --> 14:43.474
I hear it's going around.

14:43.685 --> 14:44.754
Gosh. It is?

14:44.885 --> 14:47.684
Well, it's a good thing I made
my chicken posole soup, then.

14:47.806 --> 14:49.240
Come on, it's done.

14:49.367 --> 14:51.165
Did she see the ball?

14:51.288 --> 14:53.928
No, it went into the soup.

14:54.409 --> 14:57.129
Here you go, guys. Dig in.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.606
How is it? It's my secret recipe.

15:09.616 --> 15:12.290
Yep. There's a secret in there all right.

15:15.699 --> 15:17.849
Hey, Harper. I see you're selling...

15:19.260 --> 15:20.330
What are you selling?

15:21.381 --> 15:22.610
Jewellery, silly.

15:22.742 --> 15:25.177
Here, I even made a ring for you.

15:30.865 --> 15:33.061
That's quite an unusual stone, Harper.

15:33.186 --> 15:34.256
What kind is it?

15:34.387 --> 15:36.697
It's not a stone. It's a peach pit.

15:36.828 --> 15:39.866
Because I think you're peachy.

15:40.429 --> 15:42.625
Right.

15:44.991 --> 15:46.584
Hey, Alex.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.989
What? You're locked in the museum?

15:50.113 --> 15:51.945
The paintings? A security guard?

15:52.074 --> 15:54.669
I should stop repeating
what you're saying?

15:56.356 --> 15:59.110
Right, okay. On my way.

16:02.759 --> 16:06.070
Yeah, so I just need a minute, sir,
to find my sweater.

16:06.561 --> 16:09.554
You're not an art thief, are you?

16:10.202 --> 16:12.671
No, sir, no art thief.
Just a teacher's assistant.

16:19.206 --> 16:22.119
Alex? Alex, where are you?

16:22.407 --> 16:25.002
Hey. What's going on?

16:26.409 --> 16:28.002
What's up?

16:28.130 --> 16:29.529
Oh, no.

16:30.411 --> 16:32.403
Oh, no.

16:32.932 --> 16:35.731
Alex, you have ruined some
of the greatest artwork in history.

16:35.853 --> 16:37.492
<i>Van Gogh, Blue Boy.</i>

16:38.174 --> 16:39.767
I'm sorry. Who are you again?

16:42.016 --> 16:43.290
<i>Oh, yeah, The Scream.</i>

16:43.416 --> 16:45.612
Hey, Quiet Guy, zip it.

16:47.138 --> 16:49.448
Look, you just have
to send them back. Please.

16:49.579 --> 16:52.253
But then you wouldn't learn anything.
You gotta do this yourself.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.019
Justin, that could take all night.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.331
It can't take that long,

16:55.462 --> 16:58.341
because the security guard only gave me
five minutes to find my sweater.

16:58.463 --> 17:00.102
Everybody, spread out.

17:00.224 --> 17:02.455
We've got to find Justin's sweater.

17:07.787 --> 17:10.143
That was delicious.
Did you guys like it?

17:10.308 --> 17:13.142
Are you kidding? It was spectacular.

17:13.469 --> 17:15.347
- Loved it.
- Oh, honey.

17:15.470 --> 17:16.869
Yeah, we ate all of it.

17:16.991 --> 17:18.630
All the way to the bottom.

17:18.752 --> 17:21.028
And there's nothing else in there.

17:21.593 --> 17:23.232
Absolutely nothing.

17:25.595 --> 17:27.153
<i>We ate the ball?</i>

17:32.077 --> 17:33.557
- It's...
- It wasn't spicy, honey.

17:33.718 --> 17:35.471
I know. Well, you...

17:36.800 --> 17:38.119
Do you think we're gonna be okay?

17:42.922 --> 17:45.198
We're in no way okay.

17:47.244 --> 17:49.634
If we eat the spell, we get the spell.

17:49.765 --> 17:52.360
- Jerry?
- We can explain.

17:58.689 --> 18:00.760
We were robbed.

18:03.971 --> 18:05.166
We put a spell on the ball

18:05.292 --> 18:07.727
so we could throw it through stuff
without breaking anything.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.731
And it flew into the soup,
and we ate the soup,

18:09.854 --> 18:14.725
and that is why you're standing
in the middle of the island.

18:15.416 --> 18:18.455
You know, this is kind of fun.

18:19.658 --> 18:20.728
So you're not mad?

18:20.859 --> 18:23.215
Well, not in like
an l-wanna-yell-at-you way.

18:23.340 --> 18:25.296
In like an l-wanna-chase-you
kind of way.

18:25.901 --> 18:27.254
Run.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.061
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places</i>

18:36.305 --> 18:39.218
Wait a minute.
Are those shoes too small?

18:47.750 --> 18:50.584
I know.
I hate shoes that make me wanna scream.

18:51.432 --> 18:52.467
Now you're ready to go.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.544
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places</i>

18:54.673 --> 18:57.586
<i>Oslo, Norway, 1893</i>

18:59.595 --> 19:01.393
Okay.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.509
<i>That leaves us with the Mona Lisa.</i>

19:11.360 --> 19:12.430
Okay.

19:12.561 --> 19:14.553
<i>The Mona Lisa,
and she was painted by Leonardo...</i>

19:14.682 --> 19:15.751
Di Caprio.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.278
Da Vinci. Da Vinci.

19:18.403 --> 19:19.632
I'll do it.

19:19.764 --> 19:21.357
<i>Time to go home, Mona Lisa.</i>

19:21.525 --> 19:23.163
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places</i>

19:23.326 --> 19:26.000
<i>- Italian Renaissance, 15...
- No, wait.</i>

19:26.127 --> 19:28.164
Please don't send me back. Please.

19:28.328 --> 19:31.526
But you have to go back. You're one
of the greatest art treasures in history.

19:31.649 --> 19:33.368
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

19:35.131 --> 19:38.966
My entire life, all I ever heard
anyone say about me is:

19:39.132 --> 19:41.567
"Why did Da Vinci paint her?
She's so plain.

19:41.694 --> 19:44.255
You call that a smile?"

19:45.095 --> 19:47.132
Well, you're gonna love
these earrings, Elaine.

19:47.256 --> 19:48.405
They're strung from a string

19:48.536 --> 19:51.735
that once held together
a delicious roast beef.

19:54.699 --> 19:57.817
You find your sweater yet,
teacher's assistant?

19:58.581 --> 19:59.650
No, not yet.

19:59.781 --> 20:03.696
Well, you got two minutes,
or you're going home chilly.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.543
There you are, Alex.

20:09.666 --> 20:14.139
Good thing Justin repeated
everything you said on the phone.

20:15.628 --> 20:16.903
Oh, hello. I'm Harper.

20:17.029 --> 20:19.180
Oh, hi. Mona Lisa.

20:19.590 --> 20:22.264
Do I know you? You look really familiar.

20:22.431 --> 20:23.865
She's not from here.

20:24.032 --> 20:26.024
She's from Italy. Florence, I think.

20:26.153 --> 20:28.224
Very good.

20:28.354 --> 20:31.904
Harper, that is the most beautiful
necklace I have ever seen.

20:32.035 --> 20:33.833
It is?

20:33.956 --> 20:35.993
It is.

20:37.238 --> 20:40.595
And it really brings out your smile.

20:40.719 --> 20:42.119
That is a smile, right?

20:42.240 --> 20:43.434
Yes.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.677
Thank you.

20:46.041 --> 20:47.191
What are you doing?

20:47.322 --> 20:49.200
Sending her back happy.

20:49.323 --> 20:51.679
Harper, why don't you show Mona
the matching earrings?

20:51.804 --> 20:54.399
Oh, yeah. You'll love them.

20:55.806 --> 20:57.478
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places</i>

20:57.646 --> 21:00.320
<i>Italian Renaissance, 1502</i>

21:00.928 --> 21:02.965
Here they are.

21:03.089 --> 21:04.647
Where did Mona go?

21:05.650 --> 21:07.289
She was so excited
about the necklace

21:07.451 --> 21:10.171
that she wanted
to go show her friend Leo.

21:10.292 --> 21:12.887
She owes me $35 for that.

21:18.615 --> 21:20.254
What? A necklace on Mona Lisa?

21:20.376 --> 21:22.447
No, no, no.
That is not what Da Vinci intended.

21:22.577 --> 21:23.852
Relax. She looks great.

21:24.018 --> 21:25.417
And that's almost a smile.

21:25.538 --> 21:29.852
You put a $35 necklace
on a $40 million painting.

21:30.701 --> 21:33.421
Well, now it's worth 40 million
and 35 dollars.

21:34.662 --> 21:37.018
Justin, just say it's cool.

21:38.784 --> 21:40.457
It's cool.

21:40.585 --> 21:41.654
And I'm...

21:41.785 --> 21:44.506
I'm sorry that I make fun of you
for knowing stuff.

21:45.187 --> 21:47.463
You're apologising?

21:48.148 --> 21:50.583
Will you say that tomorrow at school
in front of my friends?

21:51.230 --> 21:53.745
- No.
- Didn't think so.

21:58.112 --> 21:59.182
Good. You're home.

21:59.353 --> 22:00.388
Sit down.

22:01.354 --> 22:04.984
Look, I can explain.
I'm having a little trouble in art history.

22:05.156 --> 22:06.987
Yeah, what else is new? Sit.

22:08.757 --> 22:11.955
Now, what you're about to see
I normally don't condone,

22:12.079 --> 22:14.035
but it's a heck of a lot of fun.

22:14.159 --> 22:15.673
Okay, kids. Watch this.

22:24.764 --> 22:28.679
I guess we found out
how long the spell lasts.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.765
I hate living with wizards.
