32:37.664 --> 32:39.370
The Hanar Group hired Zanetakos.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.827
They're a majority owner
of a port in New Orleans.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.534

Houston.

32:44.713 --> 32:46.169
That's the target.

32:46.381 --> 32:49.214
New Orleans and Houston
are the two biggest ports in the Gulf.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.421
If Houston were to close--
Because of radioactive contamination.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.087
All traffic would have to be diverted
to New Orleans.

32:55.265 --> 32:58.223
Hanar's profits would soar.
They'd be the only game in the Gulf.

You need to halt all cargo traffic
headed there. That's the destination.

The one who helped you kill Fokin.

33:51.571 --> 33:54.153
I didn't kill anyone.
What do you know about the bomb?

34:19.432 --> 34:22.299
What do you know about the ship?
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:22.519 --> 34:24.976
How about a manifest, a crate number?
Help me, Tom.

I don't know who this woman is.

I don't know why there was a gun
in my house or money or passports.

All I know about is this.
You think I faked this?

34:38.660 --> 34:42.073
You think I invited a psychopath
into my house to gut me? This is real.

In less than an hour, a bomb is gonna
go off and people are gonna die.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.288
We've been through five sections
and found nothing.

34:53.508 --> 34:56.341
This port is 25 miles long.
It'll take us weeks to inspect it.

What ships have been in or out of here
in the last week from Turkey?

35:13.194 --> 35:14.320
None.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.111
Why would Zanetakos need
a low-level Turkish diplomat

35:17.282 --> 35:19.523
to get a car bomb into the country?

35:19.743 --> 35:21.984
Because it's illegal
to search diplomatic cargo.

35:22.162 --> 35:25.450
With his help, Zanetakos was able
to get the car in without inspection.

35:25.665 --> 35:26.996
It's on one of these ships.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.335
Check the manifests
for all incoming ships

by Nadeem Idris.

It's re-fabricated.
I've never seen anything like it.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.895
The bomb's notjust inside the car.
It is the car.

35:51.107 --> 35:54.224
Well, we've got minutes here.
What we've got is a big-ass problem.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.654
There's over 2000 people
who work in this harbor.

36:03.870 --> 36:07.158
It will take hours to evacuate.
LIZ: We've only got ten minutes.

36:07.374 --> 36:10.036
Can I explain something?
This thing is radiological.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.121
When it detonates, it will go airborne

36:12.295 --> 36:15.287
and everything within a five-mile radius
will be contaminated.

36:15.465 --> 36:18.798
My suggestion is you take the last
10 minutes and get out of here.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.841
What if we put it in the water?

36:21.054 --> 36:22.965
The radiation
can be contained underwater.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.048
How do we get this off the ship?
We crane it off.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.225
This isn't gonna work.
It'll work.

Because
there was no airborne exposure,

37:34.544 --> 37:38.503
the NRC is saying that contamination
was contained, which is the only reason

37:38.715 --> 37:41.422
