00:22.458 --> 00:25.208

00:26.541 --> 00:27.750
No!

00:32.875 --> 00:35.333
Thida!

00:43.458 --> 00:45.208
Bye, honey.

00:47.708 --> 00:48.541
Hey.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.083

01:44.875 --> 01:47.666
<i>It's a little after 4:00 p.m.</i>

01:48.708 --> 01:51.291
You chose a great time to call.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.750
-How are you?
-<i>I'm bored. I have nothing to do.</i>

01:53.833 --> 01:55.083
<i>It's getting cold, Dad.</i>

01:55.791 --> 01:56.666
<i>Hey.</i>

01:56.750 --> 01:58.416
<i>You're not mad at me anymore, right?</i>

01:59.875 --> 02:00.791
Man.

02:01.666 --> 02:02.500
You…

02:03.166 --> 02:05.750
You really gave me a headache.

02:06.583 --> 02:07.416
But forget it.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.750
<i>When can I come back?
I'll come back and deal with it myself.</i>

02:10.833 --> 02:12.125
No. Slow down, son.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.583
I'm handling it.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.125
I guarantee you can come back soon.

02:16.208 --> 02:17.458

Wanchai.

03:04.750 --> 03:05.583
Thida.

03:08.291 --> 03:09.666
Listen to me.

03:13.958 --> 03:15.833
Your brother was a good man.

03:18.916 --> 03:21.416
I don't regret loving Jo.

03:25.166 --> 03:26.708
I miss him.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.083
Jo.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.166
Yes.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.666
Suppose I got pregnant.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.083
What would you say?

04:31.250 --> 04:33.500
What if I really were pregnant?

04:53.583 --> 04:54.833
That's why you told me to come.

04:56.291 --> 04:57.833
I just found out today.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.750
Let's get away from here.

05:18.750 --> 05:19.583
Okay?

05:34.666 --> 05:35.916
I'm happy.

05:37.666 --> 05:39.958
I'll get to see Jo soon.

05:53.083 --> 05:57.875
3 MONTHS AGO

06:00.000 --> 06:01.208
MR. MAN

06:02.791 --> 06:05.333
Hold on. I have to take this.

06:12.791 --> 06:14.916
-Yes, Mr. Man.
<i>-Hello, Jo.</i>

06:15.000 --> 06:17.291
Come see me at Magnolia tonight.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.375
We'll take my car to pick your brother up.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.375
He can start training tonight.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.416
Does it have to be tonight?

06:24.083 --> 06:27.375
-He's just arriving.
<i>-I have stuff to deliver, don't I?</i>

06:27.458 --> 06:29.333
<i>Why are you making such a fuss?</i>

06:29.916 --> 06:32.750
Let's give him a tour.
I'll show him the world.

06:32.833 --> 06:33.666
Hey.

06:46.541 --> 06:47.875
Are you prepared to run away with me…

06:49.416 --> 06:50.375
and our baby?

07:04.791 --> 07:06.333
Wow.

07:10.333 --> 07:14.041
Gentlemen, the chefs at this restaurant
are brought in from China.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.041
They make Chinese imperial cuisine

07:16.125 --> 07:18.208
passed down through generations.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.875
The flavors are exquisite.

07:21.791 --> 07:22.958
Here it is.

07:23.583 --> 07:24.833
Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

07:25.916 --> 07:27.333
It's the original.

07:27.416 --> 07:28.291
I guarantee

07:28.375 --> 07:30.458
-you've never had this before.
-Thank you.

07:30.541 --> 07:31.750
Let me just make sure.

07:31.833 --> 07:32.666
Sure.

07:34.416 --> 07:35.333
How is it?

07:35.958 --> 07:37.750
It's so tender. It's really delicious.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.208
-It's "breaking down the wall" delicious.
-Wow.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.083
Motherfucker.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.166
-Are you blind?
-Wait. Hold on.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.583
I'm so sorry, Mr. Man.

07:52.666 --> 07:54.541
Butt out. It's none of your business.

07:54.625 --> 07:55.583
You should apologize.

07:55.666 --> 07:58.791
Who are you? Why the fuck
should I apologize to someone like you?

07:58.875 --> 08:00.750
-If you think you can take it,
-Hey!

08:00.833 --> 08:03.041
come at me, motherfucker!

08:03.125 --> 08:05.208
-Come at me, motherfucker!
-Calm down.

08:05.291 --> 08:06.541
Mr. Man, wait!

08:08.333 --> 08:10.875
Calm down. You know who Mr. Man is.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.791
-Fuck that. Don't give him my dad's money.
-Wait.

08:15.166 --> 08:16.041
Just take it.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.458
-Come on.
-Wait.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.541
Take my glass too.

08:21.625 --> 08:24.166
Take his glass. Just be done with it.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.125
Go!

08:26.208 --> 08:29.375
-Don't let me see your face again!
-Hey.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.333
You're late.

08:32.666 --> 08:35.083
I heard from Hardcore
that you have a girl.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.166
You believe that lunatic?

08:39.708 --> 08:41.791
I don't care if you have a girl.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.125
Just don't let it affect your work.

08:47.125 --> 08:47.958
Shit.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.666
-Is that your car?
-Yes.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.708
I'll tell you what.

08:53.791 --> 08:55.416
If this job goes well,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.583
I'll reward you handsomely.

08:59.291 --> 09:01.166
Then you can get a new car.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.583
That's an eyesore.

09:04.583 --> 09:06.666
You should be careful.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.750
If your father finds out…

09:10.916 --> 09:12.625
How will my father find out

09:12.708 --> 09:13.958
if you don't tell him?

09:17.166 --> 09:19.541
If I tell him, I'll get in trouble too.

09:21.833 --> 09:22.666
You got that right.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.291
There, that's my car.

09:25.791 --> 09:26.750
The stuff is inside.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.333
Let's go.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.541
Hey!

09:46.333 --> 09:47.791
Let's fucking go!

09:51.583 --> 09:53.250
Faster!

09:58.458 --> 10:00.916
Damn, it's so powerful.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.958
That's what I'm talking about.

10:06.041 --> 10:09.333
HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND
ABOUT GIVING ME INFORMATION?

10:13.833 --> 10:14.791
THIDA SENT A PHOTO

10:22.041 --> 10:23.458
REPLY. DELETE.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.666
What is that clunker?

10:25.750 --> 10:30.791
Is that a piece of junk you're driving?
Is this as fast as you can go? Fuck you.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.875
<i>I'm ready to give you
info on Ruampalangjai.</i>

10:45.583 --> 10:50.000
<i>But I need money and assurance
that my identity will be protected.</i>

10:55.916 --> 11:00.166
Hey, asshole, now you're swerving.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.958
Jo, look at them. What a pussy.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.458
IF YOU'RE READY, CONTACT ME.

11:07.416 --> 11:08.500
Hey!

11:08.583 --> 11:09.833
Jo.

11:09.916 --> 11:11.458
You're ratting on me?

11:11.541 --> 11:14.375
-No. What do you mean? Give me that.
-Who's this fucking reporter?

11:14.458 --> 11:16.125
Fuck you, Jo!

11:16.208 --> 11:18.958
-I'm driving, asshole.
-Give it to me!

11:21.791 --> 11:23.125
Watch out!

11:25.041 --> 11:25.916
-Shit.
-Hey!

13:18.708 --> 13:20.916
I almost caught pneumonia waiting for you.

13:21.750 --> 13:22.916
Right, Em?

13:32.708 --> 13:36.416
Goodbye for real this time, honey.

13:52.708 --> 13:53.666
Fuck you.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.583
Son of a bitch.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.875
Who gave the order?

13:58.833 --> 14:00.333
Lackeys like you

14:01.000 --> 14:03.750
always think someone
has to give the order.

14:06.833 --> 14:07.666
Wanchai.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.416
I'm sorry that I couldn't help Thida.

14:16.833 --> 14:17.666
So…

14:18.791 --> 14:20.375
why are you helping me?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.208
Jo was my friend.

14:24.916 --> 14:25.958
We talked about everything.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.916
We wanted to escape this shitty life.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.041
<i>Everything Jo did,</i>

14:34.708 --> 14:36.416
<i>these scumbags told him to do.</i>

14:40.500 --> 14:41.666
You asshole.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.625
You ingrate.

14:43.833 --> 14:46.416
You'll meet your end, motherfucker.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.291
But I think you'll meet
your end first, Hardcore.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.291
Tell him.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.166
That day,

14:55.875 --> 14:56.958
what happened to Jo?

15:01.291 --> 15:02.416
Answer me, asshole!

15:05.875 --> 15:07.416
It was him that night, wasn't it?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.708
<i>He took the driver
of the sports car away on his motorcycle.</i>

15:13.708 --> 15:14.666
It was this fucker.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.291
Yes.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.166
That's right. Fuck you.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.208
He helped Wat's
piece-of-shit son, Man, escape,

15:24.166 --> 15:25.875
<i>and he left Jo behind to take the blame.</i>

15:27.000 --> 15:27.958
That's why, when we got there,

15:29.208 --> 15:30.333
we didn't see Man.

15:35.291 --> 15:36.291
-Jo.
-Em.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.416
Yes.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.166
Cake, come with me.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.458
<i>Pratheep</i>

15:54.000 --> 15:55.416
<i>got the order to kill Jo.</i>

15:58.833 --> 15:59.958
Jo.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.625
You're no use to us now.

16:18.791 --> 16:19.916
It was lucky

16:20.625 --> 16:22.458
that fucker Jo died.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.541
Had I gotten to him,

16:26.083 --> 16:28.958
he would have had it
a lot worse. Fuck you!

16:30.500 --> 16:32.791
You fucking asshole!
You bastard! Fuck you!

16:32.875 --> 16:36.416
You piece of shit!

16:48.000 --> 16:48.833
It's too bad

16:49.541 --> 16:50.875
that you

16:50.958 --> 16:52.250
won't be as lucky as Jo.

17:15.916 --> 17:17.083
What will you do now?

17:19.416 --> 17:20.458
Now you've done this,

17:22.041 --> 17:23.666
you can't go back to Ruampalangjai.

17:25.583 --> 17:27.041
I have a friend near the border.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.500
I'll make a run for it.

17:35.416 --> 17:36.333
Em.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.791
Can I ask you for one more favor?

17:59.375 --> 18:02.416
<i>The truth about my brother
will reveal itself soon.</i>

18:03.416 --> 18:05.916
I won't let anyone
dictate my life anymore.

There she is.

18:42.666 --> 18:43.500
Kat.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.833
Gosh, I startled her.

18:46.833 --> 18:47.666
Wake up.

18:53.416 --> 18:54.583
I was wondering where you were.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.666
I fell asleep.

19:12.791 --> 19:14.750
<i>I'll meet you at Jaitham.</i>

19:14.833 --> 19:16.541
Muay's source says he's coming here.

19:23.291 --> 19:25.541
<i>I have proof that you run
an underground business.</i>

19:26.583 --> 19:27.916
<i>Do you know where I got that from?</i>

19:28.833 --> 19:30.125
<i>Babylon.</i>

19:30.208 --> 19:32.583
<i>You remember the Babylon project,
don't you?</i>

19:33.333 --> 19:36.375
<i>Ms. Kat, you're talking nonsense.</i>

19:36.458 --> 19:38.958
<i>I will have my secretary
call the police right now.</i>

19:42.125 --> 19:44.333
Sir, Mr. Man was in an accident.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Gentlemen, excuse me for a moment.

19:50.083 --> 19:53.041
Please enjoy. I need to take this call.

19:55.708 --> 19:58.375
Man, it's Dad.
Where are you? Are you badly hurt?

19:58.458 --> 20:00.500
It's nothing serious. I'm in the hospital.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.208
I had a little accident.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.083
<i>But I need your help.</i>

20:04.166 --> 20:06.208
<i>I had drugs in my car.</i>

20:09.708 --> 20:12.541
How many times
have I told you not to mess with drugs?

20:12.625 --> 20:15.916
I know. I couldn't get
the drugs out. The car flipped over.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.833
<i>I have more than
enough money for you to spend, Man.</i>

20:19.458 --> 20:20.291
And…

20:20.875 --> 20:22.708
Who always has to clean up your mess?

20:23.208 --> 20:24.458
<i>It's always me.</i>

20:24.541 --> 20:27.375
I told you, didn't I?
I want to be a businessman.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.833
I don't want to be a rich kid

20:28.916 --> 20:31.291
<i>who has to ask his dad for money.</i>

20:31.375 --> 20:33.083
Aren't you going to help me?

20:33.166 --> 20:35.333
<i>Listen to me.</i>

20:35.416 --> 20:39.083
<i>Find a safe house
and get ready to leave immediately.</i>

20:39.166 --> 20:40.375
In case there's an emergency.

<i>By the way, Jo, your favorite.</i>

20:43.708 --> 20:45.458
<i>He sold us out to a reporter.</i>

20:45.541 --> 20:46.875
<i>I don't know if he told the police.</i>

20:47.458 --> 20:48.291
<i>It's your problem.</i>

20:58.250 --> 20:59.416
Sir.

OF EVERYTHING.

21:29.541 --> 21:30.416
Yes, sir.

21:31.291 --> 21:34.291
Anyway, let's talk later

21:34.375 --> 21:35.583
about those troublemakers.

21:36.583 --> 21:37.416
Yes, sir.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.541
Right, call Hardcore too.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.416
<i>-As you wish, sir.
</i>-Okay.

21:52.541 --> 21:53.666
Listen.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.041
Get the car ready.

21:55.125 --> 21:56.666
-Right now.
-Yes, sir.

21:56.750 --> 21:57.666
Okay, go.

22:18.916 --> 22:20.708
I'll come get you and take you to Jo.

22:24.166 --> 22:25.500
You can rest now.

22:28.833 --> 22:30.500
There's nothing to worry about now.

22:58.291 --> 23:00.375
Hey.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.666
Hey. You want it? Wait.

23:06.666 --> 23:08.791
Here you go. Happy Thai New Year.

23:08.875 --> 23:09.833
-Hello.
-Hello.

23:09.916 --> 23:12.291
-Hello.
-Here, isn't it pretty?

23:12.375 --> 23:15.375
-It's pretty just like you.
-He's got it all figured out.

23:15.458 --> 23:17.541
-I ordered it for all of you.
-Thank you.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.875
-I wish you happiness and prosperity.
-Thank you.

23:19.958 --> 23:23.083
-Here's to your health.
-Here's to your health.

23:24.541 --> 23:26.000
All right, Jaitham team.

23:26.083 --> 23:28.083
Let's get ready for the Seven Deadly Days.

23:28.166 --> 23:30.666
Let's see how safe
that Safe Songkran campaign

23:30.750 --> 23:32.333
actually makes things.

23:32.416 --> 23:36.291
It had better. You sound like
you want people to die, Po.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.708
I didn't mean it like that.
I just think it…

23:38.791 --> 23:40.583
It sounds too good to be true.

23:40.666 --> 23:42.333
<i>I'm at Jaitham now.</i>

23:42.958 --> 23:44.166
-He's here.
-What?

23:50.625 --> 23:52.375
Hey, it's a Ruampalangjai van.

24:14.916 --> 24:16.083
That's when I found it.

24:24.291 --> 24:26.541
Jo was in contact
with a reporter from Matimuanchon,

24:27.291 --> 24:28.583
so I pretended to be him.

24:30.291 --> 24:31.125
<i>This thing</i>

24:32.041 --> 24:33.375
<i>is an important piece of evidence.</i>

24:35.208 --> 24:37.666
I secretly recorded
everything that happened today.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.708
<i>I got Wat and Hardcore.</i>

24:43.541 --> 24:44.416
Wanchai.

24:46.916 --> 24:49.166
What happened to you?

24:50.083 --> 24:51.166
I'm fine, Kat.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.375
I'm the one who texted you.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.416
Everyone.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.291
Let's go to Wat's event.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.041
It's time for him to pay.

25:15.750 --> 25:16.791
SAFE SONGKRAN

25:27.958 --> 25:28.958
Hey, Cake.

25:29.041 --> 25:29.875
What?

25:30.458 --> 25:31.291
Where's Em?

25:32.458 --> 25:34.791
-Have you seen him?
-Not since yesterday.

25:34.875 --> 25:37.083
Make some noise!

25:38.333 --> 25:42.083
Happy Thai New Year. Happy Songkran.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.833
Welcome, everyone,

25:44.916 --> 25:48.541
to the Safe Songkran event,
brought to you by Wattanakarn

25:48.625 --> 25:53.333
and our generous benefactor,
Mr. Wat Auajitsamran, who is over here.

25:53.416 --> 25:56.291
Let's hear it for the generous benefactor.

25:56.958 --> 25:58.250
Hello.

25:58.333 --> 26:01.375
Ladies and gentlemen,
brothers and sisters.

26:01.458 --> 26:05.041
Safe Songkran aims to make Songkran safe.

26:05.916 --> 26:07.958
I'm sure you are aware that

26:08.041 --> 26:12.250
for many years, we have called
the period over Songkran

26:12.333 --> 26:14.583
the Seven Deadly Days.

26:14.666 --> 26:17.041
I believe that if we have a system,

26:17.125 --> 26:20.208
and effective preventive measures,

26:20.291 --> 26:24.333
Songkran can be
the safest time for us all. Am I right?

26:24.416 --> 26:27.166
-Yes!
-Yes!

26:28.458 --> 26:29.333
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:29.416 --> 26:31.000
let me take this opportunity

26:31.083 --> 26:35.000
to introduce my latest surprise.
DJ, take it away.

26:35.083 --> 26:39.166
If you're ready for the big surprise,

26:39.250 --> 26:41.000
count down with me!

26:41.083 --> 26:42.791
Three.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.291
Two.

26:44.375 --> 26:45.916
One.

26:46.708 --> 26:48.500
Make some noise!

26:50.583 --> 26:53.666
This is the WE SAFE Application.

26:53.750 --> 26:56.458
It's a smart application

26:56.541 --> 26:58.375
that comes with a smart wristband.

26:58.458 --> 27:01.583
It contains a GPS
that will help locate you,

27:01.666 --> 27:04.041
no matter where you are.

27:04.125 --> 27:07.208
From our generous benefactor. Come on.

27:07.291 --> 27:08.916
Please hold up your wristbands.

27:10.125 --> 27:13.083
Now, twist it,

27:13.166 --> 27:16.208
and let's continue with the party!

27:45.541 --> 27:46.416
Sak.

27:50.041 --> 27:51.583
Whatever I've done to wrong you,

27:53.291 --> 27:54.291
I'm sorry.

27:55.916 --> 27:57.333
Go and take care of your business.

27:57.916 --> 27:58.916
After that, we can start over.

28:02.208 --> 28:03.166
Is everyone ready?

28:06.625 --> 28:07.750
Kat.

28:07.833 --> 28:08.750
Are you ready?

28:11.041 --> 28:11.875
I'm ready.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.000
-Hey, Theep.
-Yes.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.583
Have you heard from Hardcore?

28:28.666 --> 28:30.583
I still can't get ahold of him.

28:31.125 --> 28:34.083
But don't worry about that reporter.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.416
I'll have my people take care of it.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.333
Thank you.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.125
You really know

28:44.208 --> 28:45.833
how to launch a campaign, Mr. Wat.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.041
Today's event is tremendous.

28:48.125 --> 28:49.541
You made us look good too.

28:49.625 --> 28:51.750
I would like to thank you too, Mr. Wat,

28:51.833 --> 28:54.458
for choosing Matimuanchon
to cover this campaign.

28:54.541 --> 28:55.958
I can assure you that

28:56.041 --> 28:59.625
we will present all your ideas perfectly.

28:59.708 --> 29:00.833
Thank you, Mr. Artorn.

29:08.916 --> 29:10.500
Sak, Pratheep,
and his people are over there.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.750
Please wait here
for Mr. Wat's press conference.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.125
He will be here soon.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.000
You can't take photos.

29:20.083 --> 29:22.041
-You can't take photos.
-Kat, what now?

29:22.125 --> 29:23.000
How do we get up there?

29:23.541 --> 29:25.666
-Hey, we're reporters.
-That's right.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.250
I understand you're reporters,

29:27.333 --> 29:29.958
but you don't have permission.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.333
There's Kat.

29:33.500 --> 29:34.333
-It's Kat.
-Kat.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.500
I'll talk to them.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.250
-Hey.
-Hey, you can't go in.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.166
I'm a reporter. I want to interview Wat.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.083
You're not welcome here. Please leave.

29:43.166 --> 29:44.416
-What are you filming?
-Hey.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.708
-No!
-Don't hurt me! I'm a reporter!

29:46.791 --> 29:49.291
-Give it to me!
-I'm a reporter. I have the right!

29:49.375 --> 29:52.125
-Wait here. No, you can't go in.
-You can't go in.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.583
-What the hell? Isn't that too much?
-Yes, too much.

29:57.375 --> 29:58.875
Guys. Let's help Kat.

30:03.333 --> 30:05.291
No, you can't come up.

30:09.666 --> 30:10.500
Boss.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.083
What are you doing here?

30:30.083 --> 30:30.916
What's that noise?

30:36.583 --> 30:37.500
Everyone.

30:38.916 --> 30:40.708
<i>Happy Thai New Year.</i>

30:41.333 --> 30:43.583
<i>Right now, I'm at the Safe Songkran event</i>

30:44.166 --> 30:46.291
hosted by Mr. Wat Auajitsamran,

30:46.375 --> 30:49.666
the wealthy philanthropist
you're all familiar with.

30:50.791 --> 30:52.958
<i>I have a little surprise for you today.</i>

30:53.041 --> 30:55.666
<i>Think of it
as a New Year's gift to everyone.</i>

30:56.291 --> 30:58.333
Don't blink.

30:58.416 --> 30:59.666
Don't splash me with water.

31:01.916 --> 31:03.458
Hello, folks.

31:03.541 --> 31:07.375
Welcome to Safe Songkran by Wattanakarn.

31:07.458 --> 31:09.208
How can I be of service to you?

31:09.291 --> 31:10.333
Of service?

31:11.708 --> 31:12.625
Fucking asshole.

31:13.666 --> 31:16.166
Today, everyone will get
to see your true colors.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.625
Let's talk nicely.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.666
What do you mean by that? I have no idea.

31:22.416 --> 31:25.625
It means you're not
the philanthropist you pretend to be.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.083
-Please step back.
-The truth is,

31:28.166 --> 31:29.541
you're behind a corrupt group

31:29.625 --> 31:32.583
that uses Ruampalangjai
to do its illegal business.

31:32.666 --> 31:34.000
Please step back.

31:34.083 --> 31:35.958
Listen. Have some respect.

31:36.583 --> 31:38.791
I should sue you for defamation

31:38.875 --> 31:41.250
for falsely accusing me
without any evidence.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.208
Falsely accusing you?

31:44.041 --> 31:46.083
You want evidence? I'm the evidence.

31:46.666 --> 31:48.291
-Wanchai, calm down.
-Everyone.

31:48.375 --> 31:49.375
Relax.

31:49.458 --> 31:52.125
You forced me to do illegal shit for you.

31:52.208 --> 31:53.500
This asshole.

31:54.125 --> 31:56.750
<i>This asshole Wat and his lapdog Hardcore</i>

31:57.666 --> 32:00.416
<i>ordered me to use the rescue van
to move drugs and counterfeit money.</i>

32:00.500 --> 32:02.375
HELLO, I'M HARDCOCK.
I'M A SERVANT DOG FOR WAT AUAJITSAMRAN

32:05.958 --> 32:09.125
<i>They use Babylon as the source
of drug-producing and fake money.</i>

32:09.708 --> 32:11.166
<i>Bastards.</i>

32:11.250 --> 32:13.708
-Hands up! Hands behind your back!
-Okay.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.791
Calm down, Wanchai.

32:16.875 --> 32:19.041
You don't want me to sue you, Wanchai.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.416
Think about your future.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.208
-Asshole.
-Future…

32:23.291 --> 32:24.750
What about my brother's future?

32:24.833 --> 32:27.166
-What about Thida and their baby?
-Calm down.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.541
-You killed them. Why did you kill them?
-Security!

32:29.625 --> 32:31.458
-Why did you kill them, asshole?
-Hey!

32:31.541 --> 32:33.875
You're the real murderer! Fucking asshole!

32:33.958 --> 32:35.458
-Fucking murderer!
-Stop!

32:35.541 --> 32:36.625
I…

32:36.708 --> 32:37.708
I didn't kill them.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.000
But you gave the order.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.500
That was even fucking worse!

32:40.583 --> 32:41.625
-Call the police.
-Yes.

32:41.708 --> 32:43.500
He's slandering me. Call them now.

32:43.583 --> 32:44.541
Call them.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.041
I have something to show the police.

32:50.375 --> 32:51.333
What is it?

32:54.916 --> 32:56.916
-Spray water.
-Spray water.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.708
Hey, you got my shit wet.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.208
<i>Shoot me.</i>

33:18.625 --> 33:19.833
You two, go check it out.

33:19.916 --> 33:20.750
-Let's go.
-Come on.

33:23.208 --> 33:24.666
-Hey.
-Hey.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.250
-Shit.
-Let's go.

33:38.291 --> 33:39.625
Let's go. Follow him.

33:41.791 --> 33:42.625
Kat.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.916
Take her downstairs. Security!

33:48.541 --> 33:49.791
It's time for your boss

33:50.291 --> 33:51.458
to pay for what he did, Pratheep.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.333
You too.

33:53.416 --> 33:54.458
I'm always up for it.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.500
-Loser.
-Asshole!

33:56.583 --> 33:57.458
-Hey!
-Cheep.

33:57.541 --> 33:59.208
-Boss.
-It's okay.

34:05.708 --> 34:06.583
Dad.

34:06.666 --> 34:07.500
Who is it?

34:08.166 --> 34:09.833
-Keng, go check it out.
-Check over there. Open--

34:09.916 --> 34:13.083
-Stop!
-Hey, wait.

34:13.166 --> 34:14.458
Where are you going?

34:14.541 --> 34:16.500
<i>Excuse me. Step back.</i>

34:16.583 --> 34:18.500
-Don't.
-Come here.

34:18.583 --> 34:20.000
<i>Get the reporter.</i>

34:20.083 --> 34:21.083
<i>-Fuck you.
-Wanchai.</i>

34:21.166 --> 34:22.208
This is for my brother.

34:23.708 --> 34:25.250
This is for Thida!

34:25.333 --> 34:26.666
-Everyone.
-Hey!

34:26.750 --> 34:28.333
-Stop!
-This is for their baby!

34:29.541 --> 34:31.250
-Let's go.
-Kat.

34:39.625 --> 34:40.708
Dad.

34:46.500 --> 34:47.625
Get him, Dad!

34:50.166 --> 34:51.708
Mr. Sak, please stop!

34:52.291 --> 34:53.916
You're a fucking idiot.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.708
I should have killed you
myself last night.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.500
-Let's go.
-Let me go!

35:00.041 --> 35:01.166
-Don't you dare!
-Kat!

35:01.250 --> 35:02.458
-Let's go!
-Let me go!

35:02.541 --> 35:03.416
Come here!

35:03.500 --> 35:05.166
-Kat!
-Wanchai!

35:06.208 --> 35:10.000
Go ahead. Start the car. I'm okay.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.875
Kat! Hey!

35:14.500 --> 35:17.791
-Wanchai!
-Kat!

35:17.875 --> 35:20.500
-Let me go
-Fucking asshole, let Kat go!

35:52.166 --> 35:54.166
Dad.

36:01.416 --> 36:02.250
Take him.

36:03.666 --> 36:05.666
-Get up. You need to let go.
-Get up.

36:05.750 --> 36:08.833
-Stop it.
-Why are you taking my dad?

36:08.916 --> 36:10.541
-You're under arrest.
-He's hurt.

36:10.625 --> 36:13.625
You're charged with assault
and involvement in criminal activities.

-Take him.
-Let me go.

36:18.041 --> 36:19.708
-Take him.
-Dad.

36:19.791 --> 36:21.041
Hey. Let go.

36:21.708 --> 36:23.708
-Take him.
-Dad!

36:24.958 --> 36:26.000

Mr. Sak.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.625
Are they fucking dead?

37:26.250 --> 37:27.416
Kat, listen to me.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.916
Don't think I'll let you get away tonight.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.375
If I go down tonight, you…

37:33.083 --> 37:34.625
You will go down with me.

37:34.708 --> 37:35.916
Remember that.

37:43.041 --> 37:45.416
Boy, can't you drive faster?

37:51.583 --> 37:52.583
Stop!

37:52.666 --> 37:53.791
Get him, Baz.

38:02.291 --> 38:03.416
I'll do it.

38:14.541 --> 38:16.083
Fucker.

38:18.708 --> 38:19.916
Watch out!

38:20.666 --> 38:21.708
Out of the way!

-Hey, asshole!
-Hey, watch out!

38:24.125 --> 38:25.666
Move! Hey, move!

38:26.708 --> 38:29.291
-Move, asshole!
-Watch out! Move!

38:29.375 --> 38:31.291
You little shit! Move!

38:40.708 --> 38:43.875
-Sir, he's on our tail.
-Baz, shoot him, for fuck's sake!

Are you okay?

39:41.083 --> 39:42.000
Are you hurt anywhere?

39:47.000 --> 39:47.833
You should sit down.

39:50.625 --> 39:51.500

39:52.166 --> 39:53.000

39:56.708 --> 39:57.708

-Yes, we checked everything.

-Lift.

44:00.166 --> 44:01.958
Let's go.

44:04.916 --> 44:06.166
It's all over now.

44:07.208 --> 44:08.375
Without your help,

44:09.458 --> 44:10.541
I couldn't have done it.

44:14.125 --> 44:15.333
You did it

44:17.166 --> 44:19.541
because you chose to do the right thing.

44:29.583 --> 44:30.500
Kat.

44:31.083 --> 44:32.083
There's one more thing

44:33.041 --> 44:33.916
that I have to do.

44:35.791 --> 44:37.291
Thank you for everything.

44:39.666 --> 44:40.500
Kat.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.458
I'm sorry

46:10.833 --> 46:12.791
that before,

46:13.333 --> 46:14.791
I didn't trust you.

46:16.166 --> 46:17.208
I'm sorry.

46:23.166 --> 46:24.125
I'm…

46:26.875 --> 46:28.583
no good at explaining things.

46:30.541 --> 46:32.583
I understand you now, Wanchai.

46:40.541 --> 46:42.375
Don't you think I should turn myself in?

46:50.166 --> 46:51.166
Why?

46:53.500 --> 46:54.375
Well…

46:55.958 --> 46:57.458
Didn't you tell me

46:58.291 --> 46:59.125
that

46:59.958 --> 47:01.875
everyone has their reasons?

47:17.833 --> 47:19.833
From the look of it, it's nothing serious.

47:47.416 --> 47:50.541
<i>Folks, even though Kat's page "KAK"</i>

47:50.625 --> 47:53.291
<i>was questioned by the public,</i>

47:53.375 --> 47:55.708
<i>it's finally been proven that</i>

47:55.791 --> 48:00.666
<i>her reports on Wat Auajitsamran's network</i>

48:00.750 --> 48:04.583
<i>of volunteer rescuers

48:04.666 --> 48:05.875
<i>are true.</i>

48:05.958 --> 48:10.083
<i>Most importantly, Kat was right all along.</i>

48:10.166 --> 48:12.708
<i>If you have been following the news</i>

48:12.791 --> 48:15.166
<i>but still don't believe

48:15.250 --> 48:17.333
If she was still at Matimuanchon,

48:18.208 --> 48:20.250
she'd get to work
with you like she wanted.

48:20.333 --> 48:22.458
She might even be my boss.

48:23.041 --> 48:24.791
Come on.

48:24.875 --> 48:27.916
I couldn't do that to my mentor.

48:30.041 --> 48:32.958
But there's one thing we need to discuss.

48:33.708 --> 48:36.750
About you accessing my phone
without my permission.

48:36.833 --> 48:38.625
I knew this was coming.

48:38.708 --> 48:41.208
Yes, well, deal with it.

48:41.708 --> 48:44.458
You too, Sek. Why didn't you warn her?

48:44.541 --> 48:45.958
-Warn--
-Come on.

48:47.541 --> 48:50.041
Can't we just say that the end

48:50.666 --> 48:52.791
justified the means,
even if they were wrong?

48:54.083 --> 48:54.916
<i>Kat.</i>

48:55.791 --> 48:59.833
I'm sorry that I didn't stand up for you.

49:00.750 --> 49:02.500
What you said to Mr. Artorn that day,

49:03.458 --> 49:05.416
it was kind of satisfying to hear.

49:06.416 --> 49:09.375
Someone like him
isn't worthy of Matimuanchon.

49:12.666 --> 49:14.458
-Did I say that?
-Yes.

49:15.000 --> 49:15.833
You have a sharp tongue.

49:16.458 --> 49:17.416
But you're brave.

49:26.000 --> 49:26.833
Kat.

49:27.541 --> 49:28.375
It's people like you

49:29.458 --> 49:30.291
who are worthy.

49:33.000 --> 49:33.875
No, sir.

49:36.583 --> 49:37.833
I get it now.

49:40.041 --> 49:43.291
The pride of presenting
the truth to society…

49:45.458 --> 49:48.791
<i>doesn't come from being the hero</i>

49:50.416 --> 49:53.000
<i>or making your dreams come true.</i>

49:57.000 --> 49:58.916
<i>It's about telling the truth.</i>

50:01.083 --> 50:02.125
<i>And society</i>

50:03.250 --> 50:05.500
<i>will decide what to do with that truth.</i>

50:06.250 --> 50:07.208
Right.

I would be so happy

51:56.291 --> 51:59.916
if you'd come back and help to run

52:02.166 --> 52:03.583
It would be an honor.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.708

I already have a team that I'm proud of.

53:40.375 --> 53:41.500
<i>Don't worry.</i>

53:41.583 --> 53:44.583
Everything is perfect. I'm just chilling.

53:44.666 --> 53:46.083
There are so many fish here.

53:46.708 --> 53:48.791
I mean, how are my parents?

53:48.875 --> 53:51.833
Oh, they're okay too.
They're chilling too.

53:51.916 --> 53:53.500
Your parents are like my own parents.

53:54.458 --> 53:55.833
Wait a second.

-It's Wanchai.
-My gosh.

54:01.041 --> 54:01.916

54:04.000 --> 54:06.125
Honey, it's Wanchai.

54:06.208 --> 54:07.583

54:07.666 --> 54:09.875

So has Kiew.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.041

54:26.625 --> 54:29.666
In a few days, I'll bring Jo's

54:34.916 --> 54:36.916
<i>I'll prepare some food for you.</i>

54:38.166 --> 54:39.083
And…

54:39.958 --> 54:41.750
Are you coming alone?

54:41.833 --> 54:44.083
What about your girlfriend?
Is she coming too?

54:48.041 --> 54:49.083
-Hey.
-What?

54:49.791 --> 54:53.583
I heard there's corruption
related to ferry contracts.

54:53.666 --> 54:55.333
Let's look into it when we get back.

I haven't told you this.

55:38.583 --> 55:39.541
What is it?

55:41.458 --> 55:42.291
Well…

55:46.750 --> 55:48.875
I'm taking an English language course.

55:59.083 --> 55:59.916
Did I say it right?

56:01.125 --> 56:02.000
Hey.

56:03.041 --> 56:04.750
That was a good joke.

56:04.833 --> 56:06.500
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

56:12.333 --> 56:13.500
Well, then…

56:14.916 --> 56:18.000
Are you going to keep working at Jaitham?

56:20.708 --> 56:22.125
I'm going to try working at the garage.

56:22.958 --> 56:25.125
Em said he wanted
someone to take over from him.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.458
I also want to get to know Bangkok better.

56:30.500 --> 56:31.583
I still have some money left.

56:32.625 --> 56:35.500
My parents aren't hard up anymore.

56:38.125 --> 56:39.166

I have to take Jo's ashes home soon.

56:52.291 --> 56:53.125

56:56.583 --> 56:58.500
If you have some free time,

57:00.916 --> 57:02.541
would you like to visit my home?

57:02.625 --> 57:03.791
I'd love to.

57:08.291 --> 57:09.291
I…

57:10.875 --> 57:13.625
If I'm free around that time,
if I'm not working on a story,

57:13.708 --> 57:15.791
then I can go.

57:16.458 --> 57:17.291
Okay.

57:22.333 --> 57:23.875
Can I ask you something?

57:26.833 --> 57:29.916
Do you feel disappointed in your brother

57:30.000 --> 57:31.291
that he worked with Wat?

57:38.500 --> 57:39.500
The Jo

57:40.791 --> 57:42.166
that I knew when I was a kid…

57:44.416 --> 57:47.333
was the kind of brother
who always protected me.

57:50.708 --> 57:52.291
He could never disappoint me.

58:05.541 --> 58:06.583
Do you think

58:07.708 --> 58:09.750
they'll meet again?

58:10.791 --> 58:11.625
Where?

58:14.291 --> 58:15.416
I don't know.

58:16.708 --> 58:17.583
Heaven?

58:19.041 --> 58:20.125
If it exists.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.416
I don't know.

58:26.583 --> 58:29.625
I think what matters is that
they already met each other.
