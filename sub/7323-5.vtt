THEIR OWN DAMAGED HEARTS--

09:03.974 --> 09:06.276
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE MAGIC,

09:12.653 --> 09:14.154
WHY CARDIO?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.156
(clears throat)
WELL, CARDIO AND--AND NEURO

09:16.156 --> 09:18.158
ARE THE BEACONS
OF THIS HOSPITAL.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.591
THEY'RE WHAT PUT YOU
ON THE MAP.

09:20.591 --> 09:22.092
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:22.092 --> 09:24.064
YOU--YOU CAN'T GIVE
THIS MONEY TO NEURO.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.967
I MEAN, NEURO ISN'T EVEN
REALLY A-A DEPARTMENT.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.069
IT'S JUST ONE STRONG SURGEON.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.071
YOU'RE BETTER OFF PUTTING YOUR
MONEY ON TO A DEEPER BENCH.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.203
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:33.203 --> 09:35.205
WELL, SHEPHERD, HE'S LIKE
A CHARISMATIC CULT LEADER.

09:35.205 --> 09:36.907
HE'S VERY APPEALING

09:36.907 --> 09:39.910
AND HE'S GOT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
HIDING IN HIS SHADOWS,

09:39.910 --> 09:42.182
BUT--WELL, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
HE IS A GREAT SURGEON,

09:42.182 --> 09:44.855
AND HE CAN PULL OFF
A FLASHY PROCEDURE,

09:44.855 --> 09:46.857
BUT IS HE REALLY
CULTIVATING TALENT?

09:46.857 --> 09:49.189
IS HE TAKING THE TIME
TO TEACH YOUR RESIDENTS,

09:49.189 --> 09:50.821
KNOWING WHEN TO PUSH

09:50.821 --> 09:52.993
AND DISHING OUT TOUGH LOVE
WHEN--WHEN THEY NEED IT?

09:52.993 --> 09:54.825
I MEAN, THAT'S THE HARD PART.
I-I DON'T KNOW.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.697
MAYBE SHEPHERD
JUST DOESN'T LIKE COMPETITION.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.129
I MEAN, HE TRIED TO FIRE ME.

09:59.129 --> 10:02.072
WELL, I MEAN, NOT THAT I'M
HOLDING A GRUDGE OR ANYTHING.

10:02.072 --> 10:07.237
WELL, NOT--
NOT MUCH OF ONE ANYWAY.

10:07.237 --> 10:08.779
(laughs)

10:08.779 --> 10:10.711
I'M, UH, UH...

10:10.711 --> 10:13.313
WELL, I-I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD'VE STUCK TO MY NOTES.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.616
(drills whirring)
IS TEDDY SAYING
YOU COULD BE FIRED?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.920
SOUNDED THAT WAY.
WELL, IS SHE TRYING
TO SCARE YOU? IS IT WORKING?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.693
I DON'T THINK SO.
(Jackson) OH, DAMN IT.

10:22.693 --> 10:24.194
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

10:24.194 --> 10:26.757
DEREK'S GOT US COMPETING
FOR A BRAIN SHUNT INSERTION.

10:26.757 --> 10:30.000
THE EGG IS THE SKULL.
YOU CAN BREAK THE SHELL,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.802
BUT YOU CAN'T BREAK
THE MEMBRANE.

10:31.802 --> 10:33.263
DAMN IT!

10:33.263 --> 10:35.335
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.
HE'S KIND OF LOSING IT.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.037
(whirring continues)

10:37.037 --> 10:39.970
(whispers) I SHOULDN'T
BE IN CHARGE OF ANYBODY.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.972
JUST PUT ONE FOOT
IN FRONT OF THE OTHER.

10:41.972 --> 10:44.174
JUST GET THROUGH THE DAY.

10:44.174 --> 10:45.175
GREY!

10:45.175 --> 10:46.977
YOU BROKE MY CONCENTRATION.

10:46.977 --> 10:48.248
SORRY.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.121
UM, HEY, UH, POST-OPS LOOK GOOD,
SO IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE...

10:51.121 --> 10:53.183
OH, COULD YOU
DISCHARGE 12-24?

10:53.183 --> 10:56.326
AND HIS CHART
NEEDS TO BE DICTATED.
UH, YES,
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO WAIT

10:56.326 --> 10:58.328
UNTIL AFTER I CHECK ON
TORRES' KNEE GIRL,

10:58.328 --> 11:00.731
TURF THE WINDOW JUMPER
TO PSYCH,

11:00.731 --> 11:03.193
REMOVE A JUNE BUG FROM SOME
KID'S EAR IN THE PIT,

11:03.193 --> 11:05.966
WRITE SOME MEDS FOR
SCREAMING-KIDNEY-STONES GUY,

11:05.966 --> 11:08.799
AND THEN DELIVER LABS
TO MY GOITER LADY.
STOP BRAGGING.

11:08.799 --> 11:12.142
I CAN'T. I WAS BORN
FOR THIS KIND OF DAY.
(clicks pen rapidly)

11:14.775 --> 11:16.046
NO.

11:16.046 --> 11:17.748
STOP.

11:17.748 --> 11:19.780
SETH, NO. OKAY?

11:19.780 --> 11:22.412
OKAY? THIS CAN WAIT
A COUPLE OF YEARS.

11:22.412 --> 11:24.154
MOM, YOU SAID
THIS WAS MY DECISION.

11:24.154 --> 11:27.918
YOU SAID, AFTER MY BAR MITZVAH,
I'D BE A MAN AND I COULD DECIDE.

11:27.918 --> 11:29.860
THAT IS BECAUSE
WE THOUGHT BY 13,

11:29.860 --> 11:32.222
YOU'D MAKE THE MATURE DECISION.
YOU CAN'T JUST CUT OFF

11:32.222 --> 11:34.224
THE PARTS OF YOUR BODY
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE, ALL RIGHT?

11:34.224 --> 11:37.067
I DON'T LIKE MY THIGHS, OKAY?
OR MY SAGGY ARMS OR MY CHIN,

11:37.067 --> 11:39.069
BUT IF WE ALL CUT OFF
THE PARTS WE DON'T LIKE,

11:39.069 --> 11:42.072
WE'D ALL HAVE NOTHING LEFT.
MOM!

11:42.072 --> 11:45.075
SETH! YOUR FATHER HAS
THE EXACT SAME CHEST AS YOU,

11:45.075 --> 11:47.277
AND NOBODY THINKS
HE'S A WOMAN.

11:47.277 --> 11:50.080
LOOK, WOULD YOU PLEASE
TALK TO HER?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.342
UH...
I'M CALLING YOUR FATHER.

11:52.342 --> 11:54.745
(door opens and closes)

11:54.745 --> 11:56.747
THEY CALL ME BOOBY
AT SCHOOL.

11:56.747 --> 11:59.419
MAN BOOBS, DOUBLE "D."

11:59.419 --> 12:02.292
SOME KID KEEPS HANGING
A BRA IN MY LOCKER.

12:02.292 --> 12:05.155
I'M STARTING HIGH SCHOOL
IN A YEAR.

12:05.155 --> 12:06.997
IT'S GONNA BE
ALL NEW PEOPLE.

12:06.997 --> 12:09.059
I JUST WANT TO START OVER.

12:09.059 --> 12:11.061
I WANT TO BE NORMAL...

12:11.061 --> 12:13.463
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

12:13.463 --> 12:16.306
WHY CAN'T WE JUST SKIP
THE PANEL?

12:16.306 --> 12:18.108
WE KNOW I NEED THE LUNGS.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.110
NOT EVERYONE MAKES
A GOOD TRANSPLANT CANDIDATE.

12:20.110 --> 12:23.113
IF SOMEONE CAN'T RELIABLY TAKE
THEIR ANTI-REJECTION MEDS...
I CAN.

12:23.113 --> 12:26.176
OR HAVE SEVERE DISEASE
IN ANOTHER ORGAN.
I DON'T.

12:26.176 --> 12:28.078
OH, WELL, THERE ARE JUST
A LOT OF INDICATORS

12:28.078 --> 12:31.081
AS TO WHETHER A PERSON IS STRONG
ENOUGH TO SURVIVE THE SURGERY.

12:31.081 --> 12:33.123
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT SHE THINKS,

12:33.123 --> 12:36.526
THE ONE WITH THE SOURPUSS
ON HER FACE.

12:36.526 --> 12:38.188
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:38.188 --> 12:41.491
I DON'T HAVE A SOURPUSS.
THIS IS JUST MY FACE.

12:41.491 --> 12:43.463
IT'S TRUE.
IT IS JUST HER FACE.

12:43.463 --> 12:47.497
YOU THINK I'LL...
PASS THE PANEL?

12:47.497 --> 12:49.169
I COULDN'T SAY.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.371
(laughs)

12:51.371 --> 12:53.944
OH, CHEER UP, SOURPUSS.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.976
YOU'RE YOUNG,

12:55.976 --> 12:57.477
YOU GOT YOUR HEALTH.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.050
I THINK YOU'RE DOING ALL RIGHT,
BOTH OF YOU.

13:00.050 --> 13:02.112
PRACTICALLY KIDS
AND DOCTORS, NO LESS.

13:02.112 --> 13:04.114
I BET YOUR DADS
ARE REALLY PROUD.

13:04.114 --> 13:06.486
I'M FROM A SMALL TOWN,
A FARM, ACTUALLY.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.418
SO YES, MY DAD
WAS OVER THE MOON

13:08.418 --> 13:10.420
WHEN I BECAME A DOCTOR.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.792
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.194
(beeping continues)

13:14.194 --> 13:18.228
(Mark) KAREV.
SETH'S MOTHER JUST CAME BY

13:18.228 --> 13:20.931
SAYING SHE WANTS TO PULL
THE PLUG ON THE KID'S PROCEDURE.

13:20.931 --> 13:24.204
THAT YOUR IDEA
OF TAKING POINT?
WELL, I'M--I'M GONNA
TALK TO HER.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.107
I SPENT TWO HOURS CONSULTING
WITH THIS FAMILY LAST MONTH.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.439
TEN MINUTES WITH YOU,
THEY'RE READY TO WALK.

13:29.439 --> 13:32.442
PEDIATRIC SURGERY IS 80%
PARENT MANAGEMENT, KAREV.

13:32.442 --> 13:36.146
YOU KNOW THAT.
I'M HANDLING IT.

13:36.146 --> 13:38.919
MEGAN, HI.
UH, I AM DR. GREY.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.922
JUST CHECKING IN TO SEE
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.224
MEGAN. MEG.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.426
SHE DOESN'T HEAR WELL
WHEN SHE'S TEXTING.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.258
I CAN HEAR HER. THANKS.

13:48.258 --> 13:50.330
WHERE'S THE OTHER DOCTOR--
DR. TORRES?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.332
OH, I'LL--I'LL BE
CHECKING YOU TODAY.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.105
HOW'S YOUR KNEE?
IS THE, UH, PAIN ANY BETTER?

13:55.105 --> 13:57.167
LOOK, YOU SEEM REALLY SWEET,

13:57.167 --> 13:59.209
BUT THIS WHOLE, LIKE,
SUPER-BUSY, MESSY-HAIR,

13:59.209 --> 14:02.112
RUNNING-AROUND-LIKE-
A-BANSHEE THING YOU HAVE GOING

14:02.112 --> 14:03.613
DOESN'T EXACTLY
INSPIRE CONFIDENCE.

14:03.613 --> 14:06.176
I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW MY CASE.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.848
MEG WHEALON, AGE 28,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.121
TIBIAL PLATEAU FRACTURE
CAUSED BY A BICYCLE ACCIDENT.

14:11.121 --> 14:13.253
AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT YOU TOLD THE E.R.,

14:13.253 --> 14:16.486
BUT YOU TOLD DR. TORRES THAT YOU
WERE GOING 30 MILES AN HOUR,

14:16.486 --> 14:18.528
WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT
YOU WERE ON

14:18.528 --> 14:21.191
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S MOTORCYCLE,
AND I'M GONNA GUESS

14:21.191 --> 14:23.593
THAT HE HAS A LICENSE FOR IT,
AND YOU DON'T.
THIS IS OFF THE TOP
OF YOUR HEAD?

14:23.593 --> 14:25.595
I MEMORIZED YOUR CHART.
YOUR FACTURE WAS FIXED

14:25.595 --> 14:27.437
WITH ELEVATION
AND PERCUTANEOUS SCREW FIXTURE.

14:27.437 --> 14:29.199
YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN,
CURRENTLY ON BLOOD THINNERS

14:29.199 --> 14:31.201
TO MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T DEVELOP D.V.T.,

14:31.201 --> 14:33.974
AND IF YOU WOULD JUST TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR KNEE,

14:33.974 --> 14:37.347
THEN I COULD ADJUST YOUR PAIN
MEDS AND BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR.
SHE'S GOOD.

14:37.347 --> 14:39.349
YOU'RE GOOD.

14:39.349 --> 14:42.152
I'M BUSY,
BUT I CAN HANDLE IT.

14:42.152 --> 14:44.414
EVERY DOCTOR IN THIS HOSPITAL
NEEDS TRAUMA TRAINING--

14:44.414 --> 14:46.456
DISASTER TRAINING.

14:46.456 --> 14:48.318
YOU'VE GOT
A STRONG DEPARTMENT.

14:48.318 --> 14:51.591
NO, NO, NOT JUST MY STAFF.
EVERYONE.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.293
(sighs)

14:53.293 --> 14:55.665
11 PEOPLE DIED
IN THAT SHOOTING.

14:55.665 --> 14:58.298
NOW EIGHT OF THEM...
NEVER HAD A CHANCE,

14:58.298 --> 15:01.501
BUT THE OTHER THREE
COULD'VE BEEN SAVED.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.975
CHARLES PERCY HAD
A GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE ABDOMEN.

15:04.975 --> 15:08.208
MIRANDA BAILEY DID EVERYTHING
THAT SHE WAS TRAINED TO DO.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.941
SHE GAVE HIM FLUIDS, CONTROLLED
THE BLEEDING, APPLIED PRESSURE.

15:10.941 --> 15:13.513
THEN SHE TRIED TO GET HIM
TO AN O.R., BUT SHE COULDN'T,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.215
AND SO HE DIED.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.217
NOW A DOCTOR
WITH DISASTER TRAINING

15:17.217 --> 15:19.619
WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO ASSESS
THAT ENVIRONMENT MORE QUICKLY

15:19.619 --> 15:22.252
AND WOULD'VE KNOWN
AN ALTERNATIVE ESCAPE ROUTE.

15:22.252 --> 15:24.254
DR. BAILEY WAS NOT TRAINED
TO DO THAT,

15:24.254 --> 15:27.327
AND NEITHER ARE 90%
OF THE DOCTORS ON YOUR STAFF.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.302
SHE'LL REMEMBER HIM
DYING IN HER ARMS

15:32.302 --> 15:34.304
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

15:34.304 --> 15:36.166
AND I'LL REMEMBER.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.708
AND YOU'LL REMEMBER
THAT WE COULD'VE SAVED HIM.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.640
WE FAILED HER.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.273
WE FAILED CHARLES PERCY,

15:43.273 --> 15:45.575
ONE OF OUR OWN DOCTORS.

15:45.575 --> 15:47.677
I CAN'T FACE THAT.

15:47.677 --> 15:49.479
(exhales)

15:49.479 --> 15:52.152
I CAN'T FACE THAT
EVER AGAIN.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.024
CAN YOU?

16:06.066 --> 16:09.199
I'D LIKE TO EXPAND
THE BURN UNIT AT SEATTLE GRACE,

16:09.199 --> 16:11.741
MAKE US THE GO-TO DESTINATION
FOR SERIOUS BURN VICTIMS.

16:11.741 --> 16:13.743
I'D ALSO LIKE TO UPGRADE US

16:13.743 --> 16:15.745
TO A REAL
NATIONALLY RENOWNED CENTER

16:15.745 --> 16:18.348
FOR COSMETIC RECONSTRUCTIVE
SURGERY.

16:18.348 --> 16:20.350
TWO SUBSPECIALTIES?

16:20.350 --> 16:22.352
WELL, REVENUE FROM
THE COSMETIC CENTER

16:22.352 --> 16:24.554
WILL HELP SUPPORT
THE BURN UNIT.

16:24.554 --> 16:26.716
ONE HAND SCRATCHES THE OTHER.

16:26.716 --> 16:28.558
IT'S A NICE IDEA,

16:28.558 --> 16:31.521
AND AN AWFULLY AMBITIOUS PLAN
FOR $1 MILLION,

16:31.521 --> 16:33.663
AND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF WORK.

16:39.699 --> 16:43.403
I'M NOT SEEING ANYONE
RIGHT NOW.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.206
I'M NOT
SLEEPING WITH NURSES...

16:46.206 --> 16:50.540
RESIDENTS, ATTENDINGS,
NOBODY.

16:50.540 --> 16:55.185
SO I'M AN UNTAPPED SOURCE
OF RAW POWER.

16:55.185 --> 16:58.048
I'M TELLING YOU,
I HAVE THE ENERGY OF TEN MEN.

16:58.048 --> 17:02.522
SO WITH YOUR $1 MILLION
AND MY UNTAPPED STORES,

17:02.522 --> 17:06.426
WE CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.031
ARE YOU EXCITED?
I'M EXCITED.

17:13.763 --> 17:15.405
LEAVE.

17:15.405 --> 17:17.207
RIGHT NOW. JUST...

17:19.309 --> 17:23.273
JUST...
(clears throat)

17:25.775 --> 17:27.317
(groans)

17:27.317 --> 17:29.319
MRS. GRUBERMAN,
EVERY SURGERY HAS ITS RISK,

17:29.319 --> 17:32.482
BUT THIS ONE IS PRETTY SIMPLE.
LOOK, IT'LL MAKE YOUR SON

17:32.482 --> 17:35.355
FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER
ABOUT HIMSELF.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.627
WELL, IF THE SURGERY
IS REALLY A GOOD IDEA,

17:37.627 --> 17:41.131
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT
FROM DR. ROBBINS AND DR. SLOAN.
LOOK, I'M--

17:41.131 --> 17:44.834
NO. I WILL SPEAK
TO DR. ROBBINS AND DR. SLOAN.

17:44.834 --> 17:48.098
CRISTINA. CRISTINA.
ROY'S LABS.

17:48.098 --> 17:50.340
HE'S GOT FUNGAL PNEUMONIA,

17:50.340 --> 17:52.342
AND HIS CREATININE CLEARANCE
IS DANGEROUSLY LOW.

17:52.342 --> 17:55.275
I MEAN, IF IT GETS ANY WORSE,
WE'RE LOOKING AT RENAL FAILURE.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.277
I'M SURPRISED HE WAS
SITTING UP AND TALKING.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.578
I MEAN, A-AFTER SURGERY,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.380
COULDN'T THE IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS
KILL HIM?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.352
MAYBE.

18:02.352 --> 18:05.555
WELL, OKAY, I-I-IF WE DON'T
RECOMMEND HIM, HE DIES.

18:05.555 --> 18:07.557
BUT, UH, IF WE RECOMMEND
SOMEONE WHO WON'T SURVIVE,

18:07.557 --> 18:09.559
THEN IT'S JUST
A WASTE OF AN ORGAN

18:09.559 --> 18:12.091
THAT COULD'VE GONE TO SOMEONE
ELSE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
(roaring in ears)

18:12.091 --> 18:14.594
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.797
WE HAVE TO HAVE AN OPINION.
WE CALLED THE STUPID PANEL.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.470
(voices distorts) WE HAVE TO
STAND UP IN FRONT OF TEDDY...

18:20.470 --> 18:22.472
(roaring continues)
AND THE CHIEF
AND A ROOMFUL OF DOCTORS

18:22.472 --> 18:25.405
AND RECOMMEND
WHETHER THIS GUY LIVES OR DIES.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.408
IT'S RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE WITH
THIS GUY, LIKE A TRICK QUESTION.
(roaring continues)

18:28.408 --> 18:29.879
HE'S A TRICK PATIENT.
(roaring stops)

18:29.879 --> 18:32.512
(normal voice)
FINE. FORGET IT.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.515
THE RIGHT OPINION, THE ONLY
OPINION THAT MATTERS IS TEDDY'S,

18:35.515 --> 18:38.188
SO I WILL JUST FIGURE OUT
WHAT SHE THINKS,

18:38.188 --> 18:40.190
AND I WILL SAY THAT.

18:40.190 --> 18:42.422
OKAY.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.524
D-DON'T YOU CARE AT ALL?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.326
COME ON.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.399
YOU GOTTA CARE.

18:49.399 --> 18:52.402
(Kyle Andrews' "You Always
Make Me Smile" playing)

18:54.404 --> 18:56.906
(Callie laughing)
NO, YOU DID NOT
SAY THAT TO THE CHIEF.

18:56.906 --> 18:59.409
OH, GOD.
IT'S YOUR FAULT, YOU KNOW?
YOU PSYCHED ME OUT.

18:59.409 --> 19:01.411
WHAT? ALL I EVER DO
IS SUPPORT YOU.
(Arizona laughs)

19:01.411 --> 19:03.773
OH, LOOK AT THAT FACE.
THAT'S HER GAME FACE.

19:03.773 --> 19:05.675
SHE'S--SHE'S IN IT TO WIN IT.
NO.

19:05.675 --> 19:08.418
OH, HEY, KAREV, DID YOU
TALK TO SETH'S MOTHER?

19:08.418 --> 19:10.820
NO, SHE'S THINKING ABOUT IT.
SHE MAY WANT TO TALK

19:10.820 --> 19:13.253
TO YOU GUYS AGAIN.
WAY TO HANDLE IT.

19:13.253 --> 19:17.156
WHAT? I CAN'T FORCE HER
TO LISTEN TO ME.
KEEP YOUR FACE IN THAT BOOK.
IT'LL INSPIRE CONFIDENCE.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.229
(Teddy and Arizona laugh)
(Callie) OH, MY GOD.
(laughs)

19:19.229 --> 19:21.231
OKAY, THAT'S GETTING
IN SOMEONE'S HEAD.

19:21.231 --> 19:22.832
I'M JUST HONEST.

19:22.832 --> 19:25.365
OH, I'M UP WITH THE CHIEF.
I GOTTA GO.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.267
OH, KNOCK HIM DEAD.
OH, WAIT. HERE.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.299
I BROUGHT YOU TISSUES,
JUST IN CASE.

19:29.299 --> 19:32.242
OH.

19:32.242 --> 19:33.403
THANKS.

19:33.403 --> 19:35.605
MM-HMM. (chuckles)

19:35.605 --> 19:37.777
YOU HAVE A SICKNESS.
HMM?

19:37.777 --> 19:39.849
YOU DO.
WHAT?

19:39.849 --> 19:41.351
(drills whirring)
OKAY, 30 SECONDS.

19:41.351 --> 19:43.353
IF NEITHER ONE OF YOU
BREAKS THE MEMBRANE,

19:43.353 --> 19:45.355
I'M GONNA HAVE TO JUDGE YOU
ON PRECISION,

19:45.355 --> 19:47.457
SO MAKE SURE YOUR INITIALS
ARE CLEAN AND CLEAR.
DR. SHEPHERD.

19:47.457 --> 19:49.459
YES.
STOP TALKING!

19:49.459 --> 19:51.321
FIVE, FOUR...

19:51.321 --> 19:54.324
THREE, TWO, ONE.

19:54.324 --> 19:56.195
TIME.
AH.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.228
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

19:58.228 --> 19:59.269
(slaps hands together)

19:59.269 --> 20:00.330
(sighs)

20:00.330 --> 20:01.871
OH, NOT BAD.

20:01.871 --> 20:03.503
WHAT ABOUT YOU, DR. AVERY?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.505
I JUST WISH I HAD MORE TIME.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.277
OH, REALLY?

20:07.277 --> 20:09.409
(blows air)

20:09.409 --> 20:12.342
YOU DID YOUR WHOLE NAME?

20:12.342 --> 20:13.313
WHAT?!

20:13.313 --> 20:14.984
(laughs)

20:14.984 --> 20:16.616
YOU CONNED ME.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.618
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.321
HE HUSTLED ME.
HE WENT THROUGH TWO DOZEN EGGS

20:21.321 --> 20:24.294
AND MADE ME THINK
I DIDN'T HAVE TO PRACTICE.
WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T PRACTICE,
MEREDITH,

20:24.294 --> 20:25.795
YOU WERE OVERCONFIDENT.

20:25.795 --> 20:28.758
DR. AVERY, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE THE SURGERY.

20:41.671 --> 20:43.673
AND THEN I WOULD TAKE
THE REMAINING MONEY

20:43.673 --> 20:45.375
AND INVEST IT IN RESOURCES

20:45.375 --> 20:47.417
FOR LESS INVASIVE
PEDIATRIC CANCER SURGERIES.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.419
EVEN THE SMALLEST CHANGE

20:49.419 --> 20:53.483
COULD DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE
THE LIVES OF SO MANY CHILDREN.

20:53.483 --> 20:56.286
WOULDN'T THAT BE AMAZING?

20:56.286 --> 20:58.257
WELL, THAT IS
A VERY COMPELLING

20:58.257 --> 21:01.491
AND VERY FOCUSED PRESENTATION,
DR. ROBBINS.
YOU SEEM SURPRISED.

21:01.491 --> 21:03.663
NO. NO, NOT AT ALL.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.996
DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA CRY?

21:06.996 --> 21:08.368
YEAH.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.371
YEAH. (chuckles) UM...

21:11.371 --> 21:15.605
TORRES SUGGESTED THAT I WAS
GOING TO CRY AS WELL. (chuckles)

21:15.605 --> 21:17.947
I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD ALL TRY

21:17.947 --> 21:21.351
TO WIPE THE WHOLE CRYING THING
OUT OF OUR MEMORIES.

21:21.351 --> 21:23.783
IT HAPPENS VERY RARELY,
IT'S... EMBARRASSING,

21:23.783 --> 21:26.456
AND--AND FRANKLY, I THINK
THAT I'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

21:26.456 --> 21:28.287
AND THE FACT
THAT MY COLLEAGUES

21:28.287 --> 21:31.290
SEE ME AS THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHO WOULD BURST INTO TEARS

21:31.290 --> 21:33.793
IN THE MIDDLE OF AN IMPORTANT,
PROFESSIONAL SITUATION,

21:33.793 --> 21:36.596
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
WEEPY. THAT MAKES ME MAD.

21:36.596 --> 21:39.298
LIKE, VIOLENT. IT MAKES ME
WANT TO PUNCH SOMEONE.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.901
AND, YOU KNOW, I-I'M
THE DAUGHTER OF A MARINE, SIR,

21:41.901 --> 21:44.574
SO I WAS TAUGHT TO HIT
AS A CHILD.

21:44.574 --> 21:46.305
I WAS TAUGHT TO HIT FAST
AND HIT HARD

21:46.305 --> 21:49.409
SO YOU ONLY HAVE TO HIT ONCE,
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE HITTING

21:49.409 --> 21:51.611
A PERSON OR A WALL--
NO, A PERSON.

21:51.611 --> 21:55.014
(siren wailing)

21:55.014 --> 21:57.417
(clears throat)

21:57.417 --> 21:59.949
LET'S JUST CIRCLE BACK
TO THE SWEET LITTLE CHILDREN.

21:59.949 --> 22:02.452
(clears throat)

22:02.452 --> 22:03.953
(clicking keyboard keys)

22:03.953 --> 22:05.955
HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU.

22:05.955 --> 22:08.658
(continues clicking)

22:08.658 --> 22:12.402
I LIKE THE DARK BLUE SCRUBS
ON YOU. YOU LOOK GOOD.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.965
YOU OKAY?

22:17.467 --> 22:20.510
MY PATIENT
DESERVES A DOCTOR.

22:20.510 --> 22:23.342
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CUT.
NOBODY'S ASKING YOU TO.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.345
I KNOW THAT. I KNOW--I KNOW
WHAT'S BEING ASKED OF ME,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.347
AND I'M DOING IT.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.349
OKAY, I GOT AN IDEA.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.352
AND I-I THINK
IT'S GONNA HELP.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.354
YOU AND ME,
WE'RE GONNA GO OUTSIDE...

22:35.354 --> 22:36.125
MM-HMM.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.127
INTO THE ALLEY
BEHIND THE HOSPITAL,

22:38.127 --> 22:40.129
AND YOU'RE JUST--YOU'RE JUST
GONNA KICK MY ASS.

22:40.129 --> 22:43.362
YOU'RE GONNA KNOCK
THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF ME.
(laughs)

22:44.834 --> 22:46.636
THERE YOU ARE.

22:46.636 --> 22:49.368
I KNEW YOU WERE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.372
AT THE END OF THIS DAY,
GOOD OR BAD,

22:53.372 --> 22:55.575
WE'RE GONNA GO HOME TOGETHER.

23:06.085 --> 23:10.590
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

23:10.590 --> 23:12.592
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET HIM HOME.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.594
I JUST WANT
TO GET HIM HOME.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.025
YEAH, UM--

23:16.025 --> 23:18.127
13 IS YOUNG
FOR PLASTIC SURGERY,

23:18.127 --> 23:20.129
BUT YOUR KID'S
NOT GONNA GROW OUT OF IT.

23:20.129 --> 23:22.401
HE'S ALREADY
GONE THROUGH PUBERTY,

23:22.401 --> 23:24.403
AND HIS FATHER'S HAD THE SAME
CONDITION HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.075
LOOK,
IF HE HAD WEIGHT TO LOSE,

23:26.075 --> 23:27.907
I WOULD ADVISE
DIET AND EXERCISE,

23:27.907 --> 23:29.909
BUT YOUR KID DOESN'T HAVE
A WEIGHT PROBLEM.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.441
HE HAS BREASTS.

23:31.441 --> 23:33.443
HE NEEDS EXCISION
OF THE GLANDULAR TISSUE.

23:33.443 --> 23:36.145
AND YEAH, IT COULD WAIT
TILL HE'S OLDER,

23:36.145 --> 23:38.548
BUT HE'S A DUDE WITH BREASTS,
AND HE'S HEADED FOR HIGH SCHOOL,

23:38.548 --> 23:40.550
AND THERE'S NO REASON
HE SHOULD BE SUBJECTED

23:40.550 --> 23:42.421
TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE

23:42.421 --> 23:44.694
THAT COMES FROM YEARS
OF TAKING SCHOOLYARD CRAP.

23:44.694 --> 23:46.726
LOOK, YOU WANT YOUR KID
TO BE A MAN?

23:46.726 --> 23:50.129
LET HIM MAKE
HIS OWN DECISIONS.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.935
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

23:55.935 --> 23:58.437
HEY. I GOT A PAGE.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

23:58.437 --> 24:01.541
SOMETHING'S WRONG. FIRST SHE HAD
A HEADACHE, AND THEN--

24:01.541 --> 24:04.443
I CAN'T SEE.
EVERYTHING IS BLURRY.
OKAY, LOOK RIGHT HERE.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.517
I AM FREAKING OUT. TELL ME
I DON'T NEED TO FREAK OUT.

24:07.517 --> 24:09.779
THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE
OF MY BODY FEELS WEIRD.

24:09.779 --> 24:12.622
I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I FELL
ASLEEP ON IT, BUT IT'S TINGLING.
OKAY, SQUEEZE MY HAND.

24:12.622 --> 24:14.624
SHE HAD KNEE SURGERY.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

24:14.624 --> 24:17.126
I DON'T KNOW YET, BUT I'M
GONNA ORDER A HEAD C.T.,

24:17.126 --> 24:19.789
AND THEN I AM GOING TO PAGE
FOR A NEURO CONSULT.

24:19.789 --> 24:21.460
LOOKS LIKE

24:21.460 --> 24:25.194
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE
ANOTHER DOCTOR TODAY AFTER ALL.

24:25.194 --> 24:28.167
THE MINUTE I HAND YOU
THIS DRILL, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.139
YOU MAY HAVE HUSTLED
DR. GREY,

24:30.139 --> 24:32.101
BUT YOU BETTER NOT
HAVE HUSTLED ME.

24:32.101 --> 24:33.843
THIS IS NOT A GAME.

24:33.843 --> 24:35.845
THIS IS A REAL BRAIN.

24:35.845 --> 24:38.748
I GOT IT. I'M READY.

24:38.748 --> 24:40.249
(pager beeping)

24:40.249 --> 24:42.151
(whirring)

24:42.151 --> 24:43.953
(woman) DR. SHEPHERD,

24:43.953 --> 24:46.255
LEXIE GREY IS PAGING
FOR A CONSULT, REPEATEDLY.

24:46.255 --> 24:48.087
I'M IN SURGERY.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.689
DR. GREY.

24:49.689 --> 24:53.022
WELL, ARE YOU SURE? I WOULDN'T
WANT TO BE OVERCONFIDENT.

24:53.022 --> 24:56.025
(whirring continues)

25:02.772 --> 25:05.635
(whispers)
CARDIO IS NOT MY THING.
WHAT?

25:05.635 --> 25:08.808
(sighs, normal voice)
NEURO IS MY FOCUS,

25:08.808 --> 25:10.810
AND THIS IS CARDIOTHORACIC,

25:10.810 --> 25:13.112
AND I'VE HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE
EXPERIENCE WITH CARDIOTHORACIC.

25:13.112 --> 25:16.115
AND YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M GONNA WALK IN THERE TODAY

25:16.115 --> 25:17.617
AND HUMILIATE MYSELF,

25:17.617 --> 25:20.219
OR HUMILIATE YOU,
OR TEDDY, OR THE CHIEF.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.921
YOU KNOW, REALLY,

25:21.921 --> 25:24.594
ANYONE WHO COULD POSSIBLY
BE HUMILIATED BY MY FAILURE

25:24.594 --> 25:26.796
IS GONNA BE HUMILIATED TODAY.

25:29.528 --> 25:33.262
HE WAS ADMITTED
TWO DAYS AGO.

25:33.262 --> 25:36.806
TEDDY COULD'VE CONVENED
A PANEL YESTERDAY,

25:36.806 --> 25:38.307
BUT SHE DIDN'T.

25:38.307 --> 25:41.240
(chuckles) SHE DOESN'T THINK
HE'S A CANDIDATE.

25:41.240 --> 25:45.615
NO, SHE DOESN'T, SO JUST
SAY THAT, AND YOU'LL BE FINE.

25:45.615 --> 25:49.048
EVERYONE WILL BE FINE
EXCEPT FOR ROY,

25:49.048 --> 25:51.651
WHO WILL BE DEAD.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.182
WOW.

25:53.182 --> 25:56.956
WAY TO KILL
A HAPPY MOMENT.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.589
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:59.589 --> 26:02.692
WHERE'S SHEPHERD?
I PAGED SHEPHERD.
YOU GOT ME.

26:02.692 --> 26:05.835
ARE YOU HER BOSS? 'CAUSE THERE'S
SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG HERE.
I AM. SIR, I NEED YOU TO GO
TO THE WAITING ROOM RIGHT NOW.

26:05.835 --> 26:08.197
BUT I--
RIGHT NOW.

26:08.197 --> 26:10.640
SIR, COME WITH ME.
OKAY, UM, SHE'S--
SHE'S POST-OP DAY TWO

26:10.640 --> 26:12.642
FROM A TIBIAL PLATEAU FRACTURE.

26:12.642 --> 26:16.045
SHE--SHE WAS FINE ALL DAY, FINE,
AND THEN TEN MINUTES AGO,

26:16.045 --> 26:17.807
SHE STARTED COMPLAINING
OF HEADACHE, BLURRED VISION

26:17.807 --> 26:19.809
AND TINGLING ON
THE LEFT SIDE OF HER BODY.

26:19.809 --> 26:21.811
I-I ORDERED A STAT HEAD C.T.

26:21.811 --> 26:24.714
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE THE NEURO CONSULT.
IS SHE ON BLOOD THINNERS?

26:24.714 --> 26:28.918
YES, FOR D.V.T. PROPHYLAXIS.
SHE'S GOT A BRAIN BLEED.
LET'S BOOK AN O.R.

26:28.918 --> 26:31.360
H-HOW DIDN'T I
SEE THIS COMING?
DID YOU CHECK HER PLATELETS?

26:31.360 --> 26:33.993
YES.
AND EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL?

26:33.993 --> 26:36.065
UNTIL NOW, YES.
OKAY, WELL, YOU CHECKED
HER PLATELETS, YOU GOT A C.T.,

26:36.065 --> 26:38.698
YOU CALLED NEURO.
YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.599
THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE DOING WRONG

26:40.599 --> 26:42.601
IS STANDING AROUND TALKING
ABOUT IT, WASTING TIME,

26:42.601 --> 26:45.204
WHILE WE SHOULD BE
GETTING HER TO THE O.R.
YOU TOTALLY SOUNDED
LIKE AN ATTENDING.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.807
RIGHT?
LET'S PAGE SHEPHERD 9-1-1.
OKAY.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.840
(pager beeps)
DR. SHEPHERD,
IT'S DR. GREY AGAIN.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.642
MEREDITH GREY.

26:52.642 --> 26:54.283
JUST PASSING
THE VENTRICULOSTOMY TUBE NOW.

26:54.283 --> 26:56.846
ALMOST THERE.
ALL RIGHT.

26:56.846 --> 27:00.119
TAKE YOUR TIME, DR. AVERY.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT--

27:00.119 --> 27:02.722
DAMN IT. DAMN IT.
DAMN IT. DAMN IT.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

27:02.722 --> 27:04.954
I--
WHAT DID YOU DO?

27:07.096 --> 27:10.730
(suction gurgling)

27:20.710 --> 27:25.775
AND THAT IS WHY THE FUTURE
OF ORTHO IS IN XENOGRAFTING.

27:25.775 --> 27:27.246
(clears throat)

27:27.246 --> 27:29.178
(laughs)
YOU THINK I'M NUTS.

27:29.178 --> 27:30.680
YOU'RE THINKING,

27:30.680 --> 27:33.683
(deepens voice) I DON'T WANT
SOME COW LIGAMENT IN MY LEG.

27:33.683 --> 27:35.955
THAT SOUNDS WACKY.
(laughs)

27:35.955 --> 27:38.688
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
MY VOICE?

27:38.688 --> 27:40.760
(normal voice)
NO. THAT'S THE...

27:40.760 --> 27:44.033
THE VOICE OF
THE AVERAGE BABY BOOMER.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.265
(sighs)

27:46.265 --> 27:49.268
I WAS HOPING
FOR SOMETHING MORE...

27:49.268 --> 27:50.770
INSPIRATIONAL.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.742
FOR--FOR EXAMPLE,

27:52.742 --> 27:56.145
DR. ROBBINS SUGGESTED
THAT WE TAKE A LITTLE--

27:56.145 --> 27:58.377
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
TINY HUMANS.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.209
WHAT?

28:00.209 --> 28:02.111
ARIZONA'S NICER THAN I AM.

28:02.111 --> 28:03.412
I'M--I'M SORRY.

28:03.412 --> 28:05.154
SHE'S MORE PATIENT.

28:05.154 --> 28:06.986
SHE WENT TO HOPKINS. SHE'S MORE
RENOWNED IN HER FIELD.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.387
SHE'S A MUCH BETTER LESBIAN.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.220
I MEAN, I WAS SORT OF
A LATE BLOOMER IN THAT AREA,

28:11.220 --> 28:14.223
BUT SHE'S GOT THIS WHOLE CIRCLE
OF LESBIAN FRIENDS, YOU KNOW?

28:14.223 --> 28:16.225
IT'S JUST LIKE--
LIKE THIS SUBCULTURE.

28:16.225 --> 28:18.828
AND, UH, I'M ALWAYS JUST...

28:18.828 --> 28:21.370
I'M ALWAYS
JUST A LITTLE BIT LEFT OUT,

28:21.370 --> 28:23.873
JUST A LITTLE BIT
TALKED DOWN TO

28:23.873 --> 28:27.306
BECAUSE I HAVE A LONG HISTORY
OF ENJOYING SEX WITH MEN,

28:27.306 --> 28:30.309
WHICH I DON'T THINK IS SOMETHING
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

28:30.309 --> 28:33.142
WHATEVER. I'M JUST--
SHE'S JUST--SHE'S...

28:33.142 --> 28:34.413
SHE'S JUST BETTER.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.216
SO YOU WANT ME TO
GIVE ORTHO $1 MILLION

28:37.216 --> 28:41.120
TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

28:41.120 --> 28:43.422
ALSO FOR THE XENOGRAFTING,

28:43.422 --> 28:45.454
WHICH, AS I MENTIONED, IS...

28:45.454 --> 28:49.458
THE FUTURE OF SPORTS MEDICINE.

28:54.203 --> 28:56.035
(blows air)

28:56.035 --> 28:58.307
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
HMM.

28:58.307 --> 29:00.369
ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE, UH,

29:00.369 --> 29:02.371
YOU KNOW,
WHAT DO YOU CALL 'EM?

29:02.371 --> 29:05.374
WHEN SOMEONE'S REALLY SMART,
LIKE A GENIUS,

29:05.374 --> 29:08.077
BUT THEY'RE
A LITTLE DIFFERENT,

29:08.077 --> 29:11.520
LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE?

29:11.520 --> 29:13.522
ARE YOU ASKING ME
IF I'M AUTISTIC?

29:13.522 --> 29:16.385
THAT'S THE WORD.

29:16.385 --> 29:19.328
(laughs) OH, COME ON.

29:19.328 --> 29:22.331
YOU BARELY SAID
THREE WORDS ALL DAY.

29:22.331 --> 29:26.095
(keyboard keys clicking)
DON'T BE OFFENDED.
YOU'RE A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK.

29:26.095 --> 29:29.398
I LIKE THAT ABOUT YOU.
MY DAUGHTER'S THE SAME WAY.

29:29.398 --> 29:32.441
WERE YOU ABLE
TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HER?
OH, YEAH. SHE'S NOT COMING.

29:32.441 --> 29:34.904
I'M NOT ALL THAT SURPRISED.

29:34.904 --> 29:37.406
YOU KNOW, MESSY DIVORCE.
SHE SIDED WITH HER MOM.

29:37.406 --> 29:39.408
I MEAN, I HATE IT,
BUT I GET IT.

29:39.408 --> 29:40.910
LIFE GOES ON.

29:40.910 --> 29:42.451
(siren wailing)

29:42.451 --> 29:44.954
SO IT'S JUST YOU AND ME,
SOURPUSS.

29:44.954 --> 29:46.415
(door opens)

29:46.415 --> 29:50.059
DR. YANG, THE, UH, PANEL
IS GATHERING NOW.

29:50.059 --> 29:51.420
YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

29:51.420 --> 29:54.824
(coughing)

29:54.824 --> 29:57.326
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

29:57.326 --> 29:58.828
HERE YOU GO.

29:58.828 --> 30:00.329
THANK YOU. (coughs)

30:02.371 --> 30:04.803
THIS IS GONNA GO MY WAY,
RIGHT?

30:04.803 --> 30:08.838
I MEAN, THEY JUST DON'T
SEND PEOPLE HOME TO DIE?

30:08.838 --> 30:11.080
I WANT TO LIVE.

30:11.080 --> 30:14.313
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

30:18.547 --> 30:20.449
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO OR--

30:20.449 --> 30:23.552
I DON'T KNOW, AVERY. IS THERE
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO? THANK YOU.
DOCTOR.

30:23.552 --> 30:26.455
WHERE ARE YOU?
Uh, we're having a problem.

30:26.455 --> 30:29.428
I'M FIXING IT NOW.
Okay, I've got
a post-op ortho patient

30:29.428 --> 30:32.131
ON D.V.T. PROPHYLAXIS
WITH A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.964
Derek, she's got a blown pupil.
I'M NOT GONNA BE THERE
FOR A WHILE,

30:34.964 --> 30:37.206
SO YOU GOTTA
TAKE CARE OF IT YOURSELF.
WHAT?

30:37.206 --> 30:40.239
YOU WANTED A SOLO SURGERY TODAY.
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE. TAKE POINT.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.411
I NEED LOOPS
AND A HEADLIGHT.

30:42.411 --> 30:44.313
HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.

30:44.313 --> 30:46.415
OKAY, SCALPEL.

30:46.415 --> 30:49.518

31:02.962 --> 31:04.964
THE PATIENT'S A CHILD,
MARK.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.966
ALL RIGHT, KAREV,
YOU GOT THIS.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.598

I WATCHED MEREDITH PERFORM

33:39.188 --> 33:42.051
AN EMERGENCY CRANIOTOMY
BY HERSELF.

33:42.051 --> 33:43.622
SHE WAS PERFECT.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.525
SHE'S GOT HER MOTHER'S TALENT.

33:46.525 --> 33:50.359
SHE'S GOT HER MOTHER'S LOOKS,
RICHARD.

33:50.359 --> 33:54.563
WHAT IF SHE HAS
HER MOTHER'S DISEASE?

33:54.563 --> 33:58.537
ELLIS WAS YOUNG
WHEN IT STARTED.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.539
EVERY TIME
MEREDITH FORGETS HER KEYS

34:00.539 --> 34:04.343
OR ASKS WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK
IT IS, I...

34:07.176 --> 34:09.148
WHEN THAT $1 MILLION RUNS OUT,

34:09.148 --> 34:11.150
INVESTORS ARE GONNA
THROW MONEY MY WAY

34:11.150 --> 34:13.152
FOR THE SAME REASON
I AM GONNA THROW

34:13.152 --> 34:15.454
EVERYTHING I GOT AT THIS TRIAL,
BECAUSE THEIR DAD HAS IT,

34:15.454 --> 34:16.755
OR THEIR WIFE.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.757
BREAKTHROUGHS DON'T HAPPEN
BECAUSE OF THE MEDICINE.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.359
REAL BREAKTHROUGHS HAPPEN

34:20.359 --> 34:22.361
BECAUSE SOMEONE
IS SCARED TO DEATH

34:22.361 --> 34:24.533
TO STOP TRYING.

34:27.436 --> 34:30.439
(crying)

34:33.342 --> 34:35.073
THEY'RE GONE?

34:35.073 --> 34:36.475
WELL, THERE'S SOME SWELLING,

34:36.475 --> 34:39.448
BUT THAT SHOULD GO DOWN
WITH SOME TIME.

34:41.810 --> 34:45.284
I DON'T HAVE BOOBS.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.585
I-I DON'T HAVE BOOBS?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.287
YOU DON'T HAVE BOOBS.

34:48.287 --> 34:50.519
(sobs)
MOM.

34:50.519 --> 34:53.592
SHE WAS SCARED. NOW SHE'S
JUST HAPPY YOU'RE OKAY.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.424
(sniffles)

34:56.795 --> 34:58.497
YOU'RE THE MAN.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.829
NO, YOU'RE THE MAN.

35:05.734 --> 35:08.777
ROY HENLEY HAS END-STAGE
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION.

35:08.777 --> 35:10.779
HE HAS REACHED
THE POINT OF NO RETURN,

35:10.779 --> 35:13.742
AND AT THIS POINT, NOTHING SHORT
OF A LUNG TRANSPLANT

35:13.742 --> 35:15.744
WILL SAVE HIM.

35:15.744 --> 35:18.547
UNFORTUNATELY...

35:18.547 --> 35:21.150
UNFORTUNATELY, HIS CULTURES

35:21.150 --> 35:23.152
REVEALED THAT HE HAS
FUNGAL PNEUMONIA,

35:23.152 --> 35:25.154
HIS LIVER ENZYMES
ARE WORRISOME,

35:25.154 --> 35:26.855
AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,

35:26.855 --> 35:28.857
HIS CREATININE CLEARANCE
IS ONLY 75,

35:28.857 --> 35:31.500
WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS
ON HIS WAY TO KIDNEY FAILURE.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.562
THE IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS
AFTER SURGERY

35:33.562 --> 35:35.704
COULD VERY LIKELY KILL HIM,

35:35.704 --> 35:37.536
AND SO...

35:37.536 --> 35:40.839
WITH REGRET, I CONCLUDE
THAT HE DOES NOT BELONG

35:40.839 --> 35:42.741
ON THE WAITING LIST.

35:42.741 --> 35:46.215
DR. KEPNER, IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE HE'S A CANDIDATE,

35:46.215 --> 35:48.647
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU
CONVENE A PANEL TODAY?

35:48.647 --> 35:52.551
THAT IS...
A VERY GOOD QUESTION, CHIEF.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.553
I DID THINK
THAT HE WAS A CANDIDATE

35:54.553 --> 35:56.185
EARLIER IN THE DAY,

35:56.185 --> 35:59.458
BUT THE LONGER I LOOKED
AT HIS CRITERIA,

35:59.458 --> 36:02.261
THE MORE GLARING IT BECAME.

36:02.261 --> 36:05.334
IT BECAME GLARING
THE MORE YOU LOOKED AT IT?

36:05.334 --> 36:07.566
WELL...

36:07.566 --> 36:10.899
ALSO, UM, N-NEW FACTS
CAME TO LIGHT.

36:10.899 --> 36:12.841
UM...

36:12.841 --> 36:14.843
THE PATIENT HAS
NO SUPPORT SYSTEM.

36:14.843 --> 36:17.506
UH, NO ONE TO TAKE HIM
FOR POST-OP VISITS,

36:17.506 --> 36:19.808
OR MAKE SURE THAT
HE COMPLIES WITH HIS MEDS.

36:19.808 --> 36:22.481
EAR-EARLIER IN THE DAY,
HE SAID HE HAD A DAUGHTER,

36:22.481 --> 36:24.713
BUT LATER IT CAME OUT
THAT THEY'RE ESTRANGED.

36:24.713 --> 36:26.955
(under breath)
THAT'S NOT A REASON.

36:26.955 --> 36:29.588
DR. YANG...

36:29.588 --> 36:32.361
DO YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO ADD?

36:32.361 --> 36:34.593
(normal voice) NO.

36:34.593 --> 36:37.596
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT HAVING
A SUPPORT SYSTEM IN PLACE

36:37.596 --> 36:39.768
IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR
IN THIS DECISION?

36:39.768 --> 36:41.600
IT'S ONE FACTOR.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.233
(papers rustle)

36:46.905 --> 36:49.908
BUT THIS GUY IS BORDERLINE,
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.741
WE COULD TALK ABOUT
HIS CRITERIA ALL DAY.

36:52.741 --> 36:55.744
I MEAN, HIS CREATININE CLEARANCE
IS LOW BUT NOT CRITICAL,

36:55.744 --> 36:57.446
AND HIS--HIS--

36:57.446 --> 36:59.718
HIS FUNGAL PNEUMONIA IS BAD
BUT TREATABLE.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.990
I MEAN, HE'S BORDERLINE.

37:01.990 --> 37:05.554
BUT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN 27 TRANSPLANT SURGERIES,

37:05.554 --> 37:06.855
AND EVERY TIME,

37:06.855 --> 37:09.558
THE PATIENT'S WILL TO FIGHT
IS JUST AS TELLING,

37:09.558 --> 37:10.859
AND ROY HAS IT.

37:10.859 --> 37:13.862
IF WE GIVE HIM THE LUNGS,
IT WON'T BE A WASTE,

37:13.862 --> 37:15.534
'CAUSE HE WILL LIVE.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.466
I KNOW IT.

37:27.816 --> 37:30.819
(both laughing
and speaking indistinctly)

37:30.819 --> 37:32.821
(woman) DR. BROOKS
TO ONCOLOGY.

37:32.821 --> 37:35.524
DR. BROOKS TO ONCOLOGY.

37:35.524 --> 37:38.487
SO HOW AM I... WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY TO HER?

37:38.487 --> 37:40.859
THAT I BOTCHED THE INSERTION
AND--AND THEN, UH,

37:40.859 --> 37:44.593
I PUNCTURED THE VESSEL,
OR MAYBE THAT AN ERROR WAS MADE,

37:44.593 --> 37:46.595
OR--
YOU DON'T TELL HER ANYTHING.

37:46.595 --> 37:48.597
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

37:48.597 --> 37:50.599
I HAD TO YELL AT YOU
BECAUSE THAT'S MY JOB.

37:50.599 --> 37:52.871
MY JOB NOW IS TO--OUR JOB NOW
IS TO GO IN THERE

37:52.871 --> 37:55.344
WITH SMILES ON OUR FACES
AND TELL HER

37:55.344 --> 37:57.646
THE SURGERY WAS A SUCCESS,
BECAUSE IT WAS.

37:57.646 --> 37:59.348
HEY. HOW ARE WE?

37:59.348 --> 38:01.410
THERE THEY ARE,
OUR HEROES.

38:01.410 --> 38:03.712
THE RINGING STOPPED.

38:03.712 --> 38:05.414
(cries) IT STOPPED.

38:05.414 --> 38:06.785
THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.757
AND THE KID DID GOOD,
RIGHT?

38:08.757 --> 38:10.789
THE KID DID GOOD.
(speaking indistinctly)

38:10.789 --> 38:13.822
I'M KISSING YOU NOW,
'CAUSE I WAS WRONG.

38:13.822 --> 38:16.825
BUT IN THIS MOMENT,
I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU.

38:16.825 --> 38:19.468
MWAH.
(whispers) OH, THANK YOU.

38:19.468 --> 38:20.629

38:43.692 --> 38:46.355

RECOMMENDING HIM

38:46.355 --> 38:47.656
WAS THE WRONG DECISION.

38:47.656 --> 38:50.499
I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST...
DIDN'T AGREE.

CRISTINA,
IN A CASE LIKE THIS,

38:53.001 --> 38:55.904
THE RIGHT DECISION...
IS MAKING A DECISION.

38:55.904 --> 38:58.467
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
THAT'S THE JOB.

38:58.467 --> 39:00.909
YOU FORMED AN OPINION
AND YOU ARGUED FOR IT.

39:00.909 --> 39:02.471

YOU WERE A DOCTOR TODAY.

39:13.582 --> 39:15.584
ALL RIGHT. TALK TO ME.

39:15.584 --> 39:18.587
UM, THERE IS A BROKEN C.T.
MACHINE IN THE BASEMENT,

39:18.587 --> 39:20.589
NEXT TO IT
IS A BROKEN ARGON LASER

39:20.589 --> 39:22.360
AND A BROKEN FLUOROSCOPE.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.363
I THINK $1 MILLION WOULD
REPAIR ALL 3 OF THEM.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.666
AND THERE MIGHT EVEN BE
ENOUGH MONEY LEFT OVER

39:27.666 --> 39:29.668

ON THE NIGHT SHIFT,

39:29.668 --> 39:31.670

REALLY NEED.
