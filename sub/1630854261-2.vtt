you being selfish.

You don't consider how
your actions affect
everyone around you.

You just continue
the same pattern--

09:17.557 --> 09:19.646

it benefits you.

you'll always be good

my classes until

here who have been
pursuing dance seriously

they could walk,

necessary to make room.

could be gone.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.122
No matter what team
I've been on,

18:43.165 --> 18:44.862
my needs came first--

18:44.906 --> 18:46.299
Jackie Robinson Little League,

18:46.342 --> 18:50.172
my 15U national team,
where I met J.R.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.262
If my parents felt there
was a better opportunity,

18:53.306 --> 18:54.698
they moved me.

18:54.742 --> 18:57.919
Well, that's your
parents. That's not you.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.790
Nah, this one's on me.

18:59.834 --> 19:04.534
I'm making the same decision
by leaving Bringston,

19:04.578 --> 19:07.581
only this time,
I finally feel like I'm

19:07.624 --> 19:10.801
a part of something
bigger than myself.

19:10.845 --> 19:14.109
But yet I'm rolling out,

19:14.153 --> 19:17.286
even though I know everything
will likely fall apart.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.506
Well, self-care is
a thing.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.508
You shouldn't feel
bad to do something

19:21.551 --> 19:23.988
you feel like you
need to do.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.861
Keisha: How unfair is it
that I was supposed

19:26.904 --> 19:28.993
to audition today,
and then the professor was

19:29.037 --> 19:30.560
just, like, "Nah"?

19:30.604 --> 19:31.779
So what you gonna do?

19:31.822 --> 19:33.650
Try again next semester,
I guess.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.392
Cam, what do you think
I should do?

19:37.915 --> 19:39.743
Did you hear a single
word I just said?

19:39.787 --> 19:42.268
I heard you. You want
to know what I think?

19:42.311 --> 19:43.921
You're giving up
too damn easy.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.185
J.R.: Whoa, bro. Chill.
Kee having a bad day.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.187
No. I'm having a bad day.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.885
I just lost my classes
because some computer
somewhere is

19:50.928 --> 19:54.410
taking its sweet-ass time
posting money to my account.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.282
Babe, I'm so sorry.

19:56.325 --> 19:57.500
Let me guess.
Ms. Robinette.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.328
That woman needs
love or Jesus

19:59.372 --> 20:00.677
or something, like,
for real.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.026
You ain't lying.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.854
Well, what can I do?
How can I help?

20:03.898 --> 20:05.508
Fight for your spot.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.337
One of us still needs to
have that epic semester.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.386
[Indistinct chatter]

20:18.304 --> 20:20.393
[Exhales]

20:24.223 --> 20:27.095
Tootie, what is
your problem with me?

20:27.138 --> 20:29.619
Are you trying to stay
loyal to Thea or something?

20:29.663 --> 20:31.230
[Scoffs]
Not even.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.101
I'm not one of
her little minions.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.234
But don't get me wrong.
I do have mad respect
for Thea,

20:35.277 --> 20:37.105
which is why when she
was queen,

20:37.148 --> 20:39.586
I didn't come for
her spot, but now
that she's out,

20:39.629 --> 20:41.718
it's my time to shine.

20:41.762 --> 20:44.243
OK, well, do you, but what
does that have to do with me?

20:44.286 --> 20:46.332
Because you have
all of the qualities
to be a queen,

20:46.375 --> 20:48.247
which makes you
a threat to my rise.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.945
Well, in order to be
a queen, people have
to want to follow you.

20:50.988 --> 20:52.729
I know, which is why
I've made sure that

20:52.773 --> 20:54.992
at least half of them
won't be following you.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.560
See, I don't really care
about your beef with Thea,

20:57.604 --> 21:01.390
but it does make for
a nice unifying narrative.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.960
You told the girls that
I caused Thea's injury.

21:06.917 --> 21:10.007
Tootie, that is messed up,
and it's unnecessary.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.271
We can all shine.

21:14.055 --> 21:16.623
That's not the way
the world works.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.321
Get used to your
new normal, Six.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.415
Amara: I'm saying
the financial aid

21:26.459 --> 21:28.765
and registrar rules
are penalizing students

21:28.809 --> 21:30.985
for things beyond
their control.

21:31.028 --> 21:33.117
Our processes are
tried and true.

21:33.161 --> 21:36.773
Perhaps Mr. Watkins
should use this as
a teachable moment.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.298
Or maybe we shouldn't miss
the moment

21:39.341 --> 21:42.910
and evaluate how financial aid
and registration are done.

21:42.953 --> 21:46.783
Dr. Patterson, there
are some faculty members

21:46.827 --> 21:48.568
who are rooting
for you.

21:48.611 --> 21:51.092
So a little word
of advice:

21:51.135 --> 21:53.094
if it ain't broke--

21:53.137 --> 21:55.009
Listen to my words:

21:55.052 --> 21:58.491
Reevaluate financial aid
and registration.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.144
This is not optional.

22:00.188 --> 22:04.627
In that case,
I'll get right on it.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.282
[Scoffs]

22:07.326 --> 22:10.285
Hey, sweetie, come on in.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.808
What can I do for you?

22:11.852 --> 22:13.984
Simone: I mean, I was
coming to get some advice.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.160
But don't mind me.
What's up with you and her?

22:16.204 --> 22:17.858
I knew being president
would be hard,

22:17.901 --> 22:20.513
I just assumed
faculty and staff

22:20.556 --> 22:22.036
would have my back.

22:22.079 --> 22:25.605
Now you see people on your
team who ain't for you.

22:26.954 --> 22:29.173
Auntie, look,
this is your moment.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.001
Be the president
you want to be,

22:31.045 --> 22:32.786
the one who fights
for her students

22:32.829 --> 22:34.657
and makes sure
their voices are heard.

22:34.701 --> 22:38.879
You're right. I can't
let anyone stand in my way.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.403
I need to change my approach,

22:41.447 --> 22:43.492
go around or through
whoever I need

22:43.536 --> 22:45.625
to get things done.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.370
OK! Look at you coming
through with the wisdom.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.762
Well, you know.

to be my job.

did you need advice on?

a proposal.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.937
but I want to see Sims
play against Bringston

and Lando against
Hawkins.

is or how much money he got.

and change the game.

that my journey is

to be to get me here.

Your form is a bit off,

40:08.667 --> 40:10.973

not being ready

41:13.383 --> 41:18.693
to come back as head coach,

41:18.737 --> 41:21.304
if I can come onboard
as assistant coach.
