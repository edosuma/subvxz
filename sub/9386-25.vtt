WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:05.005
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.088 --> 00:08.258
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.342 --> 00:12.304
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:12.387 --> 00:15.474
On which we used to rely?

00:15.557 --> 00:18.602
Lucky there's a Family Guy

00:18.685 --> 00:21.772
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.855 --> 00:23.482
All the things
that make us

00:23.565 --> 00:25.025
Laugh and cry

00:25.108 --> 00:30.822
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:34.618 --> 00:37.538
Oh, Brian, we're so thrilled
your gay cousin, Jasper,

00:37.621 --> 00:39.289
finally decided
to come visit.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.749
Me, too.
It's been way too long.

00:40.832 --> 00:41.917
Anyway,
thanks for putting him up.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.252
No problem, Brian.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.461
It's great to have visitors.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.338
Except for that time
Moby Dick stayed with us.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.549
Do you have any Raisin Bran?

00:48.632 --> 00:51.134
Uh, oh, no, sorry.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.219
(sighs)

00:52.302 --> 00:54.346
Well, can you go
get me some?

00:54.429 --> 00:56.807
Uh, boy, that's kind of
a pain in the...

00:56.890 --> 00:58.350
(stutters)
We do have, uh...

00:58.433 --> 01:00.102
We got Total,
and we got some raisins.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.979
I mean, you could,
like, mix those together.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.647
I mean, it would be kind
of like Raisin Bran.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.982
Mmm, yeah, but it's not.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.401
It'd be like Raisin Bran,
but it's not Raisin Bran.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.569
That would be like
Total with raisins in it.

01:08.652 --> 01:09.945
That's just
splitting hairs here.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.655
It's not really
doing it for me.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.991
What time did you say
your flight was?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.873
Oh, no locks.
Thank you, Homeland Security.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.042
Hey, bud, take a break.
I'll take over.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.920
-Go smoke a fatty.
-Thanks!

01:27.212 --> 01:29.298
MAN ON RADIO: This is
Sierra Tango 817,

01:29.381 --> 01:30.716
Matthew McConaughey's
private jet,

01:30.799 --> 01:32.092
requesting
permission to land.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.427
Matthew McConaughey?

01:33.510 --> 01:35.220
Oh, sorry, Sierra Tango 817.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.513
All our runways are filled.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.099
MAN: But it looks empty from up here.
We're almost out of fuel.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.434
No, no. No room at all.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.352
But, lucky for you,
there's a big, new airport

01:42.436 --> 01:43.687
out in
the middle of the ocean.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.938
Keep going.
You can't miss it.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.649
-MAN: Roger that.
-(beeping)

01:47.733 --> 01:49.401
Oops.
Well, look at it this way.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.820
I just got you on next year's
Oscar telecast.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.864
You'll be right after
Ron Howard!

01:53.947 --> 01:54.948
(dramatic music plays)

01:55.032 --> 01:56.074
Just messing with you, Ron.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.035
-Or maybe not!
-(dramatic music plays)

01:58.118 --> 01:59.328
No, seriously, I am.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.455
Or am I? No.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.290
Oh, there's Jasper's plane.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.625
-Where?
-Third one in line.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.877
Oh, it's one of them
new niche airlines.

02:08.545 --> 02:09.963
(tires screeching)
(banging)

02:12.716 --> 02:14.259
Hey, Cousin!

02:14.343 --> 02:16.053
(chuckles) Hey, hey, Jasper!

02:16.136 --> 02:17.513
Everybody, this is Ricardo,

02:17.596 --> 02:19.431
from the Philippines
and my kitchen floor.

02:19.515 --> 02:20.599
How was your flight?

02:20.682 --> 02:23.268
Oh, torture!
Five hours on my moneymaker,

02:23.352 --> 02:24.978
sitting across
from a gaggle of sailors

02:25.062 --> 02:26.063
flying home on leave.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.814
Here I am
in a committed relationship,

02:27.898 --> 02:30.025
and all I can think about is
having a piece of Navy cake.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.778
"Hello.
Who's that on the phone?" "Temptation!"

02:32.861 --> 02:34.530
How does he
always get my number? I don't know.

02:34.613 --> 02:38.367
Anyway, I got big news, and I'll tell you
over dinner. Greek. On me.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.618
But enough
about last weekend.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.078
(chuckles) I'm terrible!

02:41.161 --> 02:43.455
Uck! This idiot
will fit in with our family

02:43.539 --> 02:45.749
as badly as Peter
fit in with The Proclaimers.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.336
THE PROCLAIMERS:
But I would walk 500 miles

02:49.419 --> 02:53.006
And I would walk 500 more

02:53.090 --> 02:57.511
Just to be the man
who walks a thousand miles

02:57.594 --> 03:00.222
To fall down at your door

03:00.305 --> 03:02.015
-THE PROCLAIMERS:Da-da-da
-Da-da-da

03:02.099 --> 03:04.017
-THE PROCLAIMERS:Da-da-da
-Da-da-da

03:04.101 --> 03:05.727
-THE PROCLAIMERS:Da-da
-Da-da-da-da-da

03:05.811 --> 03:07.646
I'm singing! I'm singing!

03:11.817 --> 03:14.570
Hey, Chris, this field trip
is your chance, man.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.321
Alyssa is all alone.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.743
She's so pretty that if your Hacky Sack
were my private parts,

03:21.827 --> 03:23.704
I'd let her do that to them.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.873
What? Kick them around?

03:25.956 --> 03:28.667
Um, wait. Yes.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.587
Welcome, citizens.
Today we commemorate

03:31.670 --> 03:33.046
those brave Quahog soldiers

03:33.130 --> 03:35.966
who perished
in the recent Gulf conflict.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.094
I can think
of no greater tribute to their memories

03:39.178 --> 03:40.929
than this solid gold statue

03:41.013 --> 03:44.433
of Dig 'Em,
the Sugar Smacks frog.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.059
-(crowd murmuring)
-MAN: What is that?

03:46.143 --> 03:47.603
The spirit of America

03:47.686 --> 03:50.397
is epitomized
by his inspiring motto,

03:50.480 --> 03:52.900
"Smack, smack, Sugar Smack.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.235
"Give me a smack,
and I'll smack you back."

03:55.319 --> 03:56.737
(crowd shouting)

03:56.820 --> 03:58.822
I'd also like
to take this opportunity

03:58.906 --> 04:00.741
to announce
extreme budget cutbacks

04:00.824 --> 04:04.536
having almost nothing to do
with this solid gold statue.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.041
Have you ever seen
such a waste of the taxpayers' money?

04:09.124 --> 04:10.584
You're talking to me!

04:10.667 --> 04:12.336
This is more exciting
than that time

04:12.419 --> 04:14.171
me and my friends
did mushrooms.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.173
This is gonna be awesome!

04:16.256 --> 04:17.674
You said it.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.011
(in deep voice) Man,
you guys feel anything yet?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.596
(in deep voice)
I feel kind of funny.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.722
(in deep voice)
I got a bellyache.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.682
We shouldn't
have did this, man.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.356
Lois, darling, those earrings
are delicious. Total kitsch.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.982
Like an Andy Warhol
wet dream.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.818
I'm opening a museum and putting you
in it, they're that fabulous.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.112
You think it's clever
talking like that, do you?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.322
You think it's funny?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.949
Talking about earrings,
and using words

04:42.032 --> 04:44.701
like "fabulous"
and "delicious" and "wet."

04:44.785 --> 04:46.161
What's next? A workout

04:46.245 --> 04:48.705
followed by a romp around a crowded room
while the music goes...

04:48.789 --> 04:51.208
(mimics throbbing music)

04:54.086 --> 04:55.254
Oh, why'd you stop?

04:55.337 --> 04:56.713
Hey, Jasper,
let me ask you something.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.757
When you're in the shower
at the "Y,"

04:58.841 --> 05:01.260
is-is that just like
Supermarket Sweep for you guys,

05:01.343 --> 05:02.553
or is there
some kind of etiquette?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.887
Peter, stop it.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.889
God! You're more clueless
than Popeye.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.101
Sir, I think you should know
these growths on your forearms,

05:09.184 --> 05:10.352
they're giant tumors.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.812
(talking gibberish)

05:11.895 --> 05:12.896
Oh, dear.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.231
Yeah, I'm surprised
you haven't realized

05:14.314 --> 05:16.483
this is not how a human being
is supposed to look.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.819
(talking gibberish)

05:18.902 --> 05:21.530
And the speech thing,
and what you're doing with your eye?

05:21.613 --> 05:23.949
Uh, you had a stroke
about seven years ago.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.993
(talking gibberish)

05:26.076 --> 05:28.495
That you've managed
to be walking around all this time

05:28.579 --> 05:30.038
is nothing
short of a miracle.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.540
(talking gibberish)

05:31.623 --> 05:32.833
I'd say about two months.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.169
Okay, all right,
time for the big announcement.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.755
Everyone, Ricardo and I
are getting married!

05:38.839 --> 05:40.132
Oh, that is terrific!

05:40.215 --> 05:42.050
It's about time
you two settled down.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.260
Oh, you hear that, Meg?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.137
Guys can marry
other guys now.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.472
So... This is awkward,
but, uh,

05:47.556 --> 05:51.018
I mean, if they can do that,
that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.353
I mean, you might as well
pack it in. Game over.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.275
Uh, Alyssa, hi.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.111
I--I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to...

06:01.195 --> 06:03.322
-do something sometime?
-Sure, Chris.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.158
I have a Young Republicans
meeting after school. You wanna come?

06:06.241 --> 06:09.661
Oh, sure. W-What do you do
at a Young Republicans meeting?

06:09.745 --> 06:12.623
We help those who already have
the means to help themselves.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.333
Also, we perpetuate the ideal

06:14.416 --> 06:17.961
that Jesus chose America to destroy
nonbelievers and brown people.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.757
I don't understand what you're saying,
but somehow I feel safer.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.261
(no discernible dialog)

06:26.345 --> 06:27.471
Karl, this is Chris.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.722
He wants to join our club.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.307
Karl is our chancellor.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.934
Well, Chris,
we'd be happy to have you.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.853
There's just
one little rite of initiation.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.026
Oh, this is one fine day
to be nude

06:41.109 --> 06:44.321
Yeah, this is one fine day
to be nude

06:44.404 --> 06:45.822
(birds chirping)

06:45.906 --> 06:48.742
The birds are singing,
"Clinton, have a wonderful spring"

06:48.825 --> 06:50.911
And people walking by

06:50.994 --> 06:52.663
Can stop
and look at my thing

06:52.746 --> 06:54.540
Oh, this is one fine day

06:54.623 --> 06:56.750
Liberal chubby chaser!

06:56.834 --> 06:59.545
(laughing)
Well, if you can't laugh at yourself...

06:59.628 --> 07:01.755
(shouting)

07:04.091 --> 07:06.468
I'm here at the parking lot
outside city hall,

07:06.552 --> 07:08.512
where hundreds of citizens
have come out in protest

07:08.595 --> 07:12.140
of the Mayor's decision to spend
the town's treasury on a gold frog.

07:12.224 --> 07:13.600
I don't like it.

07:13.684 --> 07:17.020
And I don't like
the contraction "apostrophe-E-M."

07:17.104 --> 07:20.566
As far as I'm concerned,
his name is Dig Them.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.609
You're not welcome here,
Dig Them.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.611
I stand behind my decision.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.405
This press conference
is over.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.324
I can't see you now.
I can't hear you now. You're not here now.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.661
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la

07:32.744 --> 07:34.955
Well, there you have it.
Back to you, Tom.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.627
Thanks, Tom.
Some damn fine reporting.

07:40.711 --> 07:41.879
Damn fine. Diane?

07:42.713 --> 07:44.173
Well,
it's encouraging to know

07:44.256 --> 07:47.509
that I'm not the only Mayor West
who's facing difficulties.

07:47.593 --> 07:50.179
But what I need now
is a diversion.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.263
Let's see.

07:57.728 --> 08:00.480
Mmm. "Jingle keys."

08:00.564 --> 08:02.566
(crowd shouting)

08:05.402 --> 08:08.113
My God! I'm a tomato!

08:10.073 --> 08:12.409
ANNOUNCER: And now back
to The Sound of Music.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.287
(dramatic music playing)

08:18.749 --> 08:20.542
(engines sputtering)

08:20.626 --> 08:22.169
Oh, thank heaven.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.795
The Von Trapp family escaped!

08:23.879 --> 08:25.797
Reverend Mother,
I have sinned.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.925
What is this sin, my child?

08:29.259 --> 08:30.677
Oh, well. No harm done.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.513
I too have sinned, Mother.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.181
Oh, my God!

08:34.264 --> 08:35.265
That's Rolfe!

08:35.349 --> 08:36.808
What the hell
is wrong with you?

08:36.892 --> 08:39.269
Hey, I didn't start
this war, but it's on!

08:40.646 --> 08:42.272
Oh, Lois, there you are.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.774
Listen,
Ricardo and I wanna thank you

08:43.857 --> 08:45.526
for letting us
have the wedding here.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.320
Oh! You're--You're having
the wedding here?

08:48.403 --> 08:50.697
Yeah. I hope that's okay, Lois.
I offered them the house.

08:50.781 --> 08:54.201
Oh, uh, sure. N-No problem.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.911
Hey, McButt the Crime Dog,

08:55.994 --> 08:58.580
I heard you and your little chew toy
getting it on last night.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.582
-Keep it down.
-Sorry, little man.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.917
Ricardo and I
were playing Clue,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.461
and he got me in the bedroom
with a lead pipe.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.588
Peter, I'm not sure
I'm comfortable

09:06.672 --> 09:08.131
having this wedding
at the house.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.801
Lois, I don't know
what the big deal is. So they're gay.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.720
It's not like we're gonna have
a gay sex orgy in the living room.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.851
That's not
what I'm talking about.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.894
I've got nothing
against homosexuals.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.230
I mean, I'll watch anything
with David Schwimmer.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.733
But the idea of two men
actually getting married,

09:26.817 --> 09:28.652
it just doesn't seem right.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.070
Hey, I say
who cares, you know?

09:30.153 --> 09:32.739
If gays wanna get married
and be miserable like the rest of us,

09:32.823 --> 09:35.284
-I say we should let them.
-JASPER: Oh, no!

09:35.367 --> 09:36.827
-What's wrong?
-Look.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.621
Some breaking news today
when Mayor West announced he will sign

09:39.705 --> 09:42.249
a citywide ban
on gay marriages next week.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.876
While controversial,
it has nonetheless

09:43.959 --> 09:46.795
effectively distracted all of us
from the Dig 'Em fiasco.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.006
-The what?
-I don't know. Something about a lizard.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.257
And now this.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.550
Look at that.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.927
In the '30s, they called this
an Uncle Spinny Dervish.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.846
-Really?
-I don't know. I'm just bored.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.932
A ban on gay marriage?
Oh, my God!

09:59.016 --> 10:00.017
(door bell rings)

10:01.226 --> 10:02.603
Matthew McConaughey?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.396
Yeah, I'm looking
for a guy named Stewie.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.522
Ow!

10:05.606 --> 10:07.399
Chris, grab his legs.
I gotta bury this thing.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.067
-But I...
-(shouts) Grab his legs!

10:16.700 --> 10:19.286
I can't believe
the wedding's off.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.913
All I ever wanted
was to get married

10:20.996 --> 10:23.457
and make a home
with a skinny, hairless Filipino boy.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.209
Isn't that
the American dream?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.543
Oh, don't give up yet, Jasper.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.170
Mayor West
only banned gay marriage

10:28.253 --> 10:30.422
so he could distract
from the Dig 'Em scandal.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.924
-He won't get away with it.
-Mmm.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.092
Oh, Jasper, where'd you get
these brownies?

10:34.176 --> 10:36.762
They're from a bakery
in the West Quahog gay district.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.555
I thought
they'd help my depression.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.807
Oh, I can see why.
Oh, my God,

10:40.891 --> 10:43.101
they pack so much fudge
into these.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.729
And--And look at this. There's even
a couple of nuts lodged in there.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.231
I'm going upstairs.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.524
Oh, I've got to do something.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.901
Jasper's always
been there for me when I've needed him.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.445
I am gonna make Mayor West
change his mind.

10:53.529 --> 10:57.324
But, Brian, the Bible
says gay marriage is an abomination.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.576
Oh, don't give me
that Young Republican crap, Chris.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.954
The Bible also says
a senior citizen built an ark

11:02.037 --> 11:04.039
and rounded up
two of every animal.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.001
-Hey.
-Yeah?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.003
What the hell is this?

11:10.087 --> 11:13.423
Oh, you didn't really give
any specific guidelines about mating.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.716
-Did you name it?
-What?

11:14.800 --> 11:17.261
-Did you name it?
-Uh, yeah, he's Paul.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.638
Yeah? Well, it's gonna be
a hell of a lot harder for you now,

11:19.721 --> 11:21.306
because he's going
the (bleeps) overboard.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.393
-(doorbell rings)
-Hi, Glenn.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.562
Uh, hey, will you sign
a petition to overturn

11:26.645 --> 11:28.146
Mayor West's ban
on gay marriage?

11:28.230 --> 11:29.690
Gay marriage?
Oh, come on,

11:29.773 --> 11:31.483
two halves can't make a whole
without a hole.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.943
Giggity, Giggity,
Giggity, Giggity.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.821
Ooh-ee-ooh-ah-ah,
ting-tang- walla-walla-bing-bang

11:35.904 --> 11:38.740
Ooh-ee-ooh-ah-ah,
ting-tang-walla-walla- bing-bang

11:38.824 --> 11:41.368
You get off my property,
you pervert.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.162
Uh, Mr. Bottomtooth,
would you like to sign the petition?

11:44.246 --> 11:47.082
(incoherently speaking)

11:47.165 --> 11:50.419
Uh, I--I don't...
W-W-What's--What's-- What's the problem?

11:50.502 --> 11:53.005
(incoherently speaking)

11:54.590 --> 11:56.258
Ah! Okay. Thank you.

11:59.386 --> 12:04.183
(mumbling)
Amazing grace

12:04.266 --> 12:09.646
How sweet the sound

12:13.650 --> 12:15.235
Chris, did you hear?

12:15.319 --> 12:18.113
Some dog is going around town
trying to get support for gay marriage.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.490
Oh, that's Brian.
He's got a petition.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.827
Really? Chris, you've got
to destroy that petition.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.746
-Why?
-Because if you do,

12:25.829 --> 12:27.331
I'll let you touch
my boobs.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.501
Is--Is--Is that good?
Do--Do I want that?

12:30.584 --> 12:32.002
Oh, yeah, you want that.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.921
Well, fantastic then.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.883
How can I help you,
Mrs. Griffin?

12:37.966 --> 12:40.219
Well, I'm having
a bit of a crisis.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.762
I'm a very
open-minded person,

12:41.845 --> 12:44.556
and I've never
had any problem with gays before,

12:44.640 --> 12:48.101
but something about
two gay people getting married,

12:48.185 --> 12:50.145
I--I just don't think
it's right.

12:50.229 --> 12:51.939
Well, these questions
are too big

12:52.022 --> 12:53.398
to be decided
by human beings.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.734
Which is why God
made this film.

12:55.817 --> 12:56.944
(projector whirring)

12:57.027 --> 12:58.028
(beeps)

12:58.111 --> 13:00.489
(fanfare)

13:00.572 --> 13:03.992
You know, there's been
a lot of talk lately about homosexuals,

13:04.076 --> 13:05.744
but how do you know
what to believe?

13:05.827 --> 13:10.207
Well, here are a few tips that may
help you tell when you've got a gay.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.918
So, uh,
what's your favorite Madonna album?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.545
I like her early work.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.297
-MAN: If his answer is anything but
-"I've never bought one,"

13:17.381 --> 13:19.258
-(bangs)
-you've got a gay.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.593
Let's take a blood sample,
Mr. Braga.

13:21.677 --> 13:22.678
(sizzles)

13:22.803 --> 13:23.971
MAN: If instead
of human blood,

13:24.054 --> 13:26.139
you find
a deadly corrosive acid,

13:26.223 --> 13:28.308
-you've got a gay.
-(bangs)

13:29.935 --> 13:31.603
(roars)

13:31.687 --> 13:33.730
(screeches)

13:35.983 --> 13:38.360
MAN:
Not this time, nancy boy.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.364
Well, that was interesting.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.367
I also have My Giant
with Billy Crystal.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.160
Oh, God, no, no.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.124
Well, we almost have
enough signatures,

13:52.207 --> 13:53.750
thanks to
Quahog's gay district.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.962
Lois, how'd you like to be
signature number 10,000?

13:57.045 --> 13:59.423
-Brian, I can't sign this.
-Why not?

13:59.506 --> 14:02.301
Well, because I don't believe
in gay marriage.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.928
You don't believe...
Lois, that's ridiculous.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.430
Gay people have every right
to get married.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.682
Well, they certainly
have every right to be together,

14:08.765 --> 14:11.226
but marriage should be
between a man and a woman.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.520
Well, that's not how they
do it in West Quahog.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.647
By the way, Lois,
I got a piercing over there.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.774
I'm not gonna tell you where,
but I'll give you a hint.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.819
It wasn't my nose or my ear,
and it was one of my balls.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.321
Well, regardless
of what you think,

14:22.404 --> 14:24.239
this is going to change
Mayor West's mind,

14:24.323 --> 14:25.991
and we are gonna have
Jasper's wedding here.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.286
Fine. Then until this is all over,
I'll stay somewhere else.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.455
Come on, Stewie, we're going
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.166
Fine, I'll go,
but I'm not missing that gay wedding.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.709
I still kick myself
for missing

14:35.792 --> 14:37.169
that topless
cheerleader parade

14:37.252 --> 14:38.504
with the 100-foot
chocolate teddy bear

14:38.587 --> 14:40.714
and the F-16s doing
aerial acrobatics,

14:40.797 --> 14:42.633
choreographed
to the music of Queen.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.551
Oh, I remember that day.

14:45.594 --> 14:48.180
Huh. Should have gone
to that thing.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.601
-(gasps)
-(flicks)

14:53.435 --> 14:55.604
My petition!
What the hell are you doing?

14:55.687 --> 14:58.482
I'm going to get to touch
right-wing boob because of this.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.360
You idiot! Now I'm going
to have to get 10,000 more signatures

15:01.443 --> 15:03.570
before tomorrow morning.
What were you thinking?

15:03.654 --> 15:05.364
You don't understand, Brian.

15:05.447 --> 15:08.033
When was the last time
you were even with a woman?

15:08.116 --> 15:11.161
-Uh, when did the Challenger blow up?
-'86.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.330
Yeah, it was like
three years before that.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.752
Mayor West, here's the gay marriage ban
for your approval.

15:18.836 --> 15:20.546
Excellent.
This is so important,

15:20.629 --> 15:22.798
I'm going to sign it
with all capital letters.

15:22.881 --> 15:26.385
It's going to say,
"Adam West"!

15:26.468 --> 15:28.220
That's what it's
going to say, you'll see.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.597
Hey, buddy,
you can't go in there.

15:30.681 --> 15:31.682
(panting)

15:31.765 --> 15:33.183
Mayor West,
you have to look at this.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.852
Ten thousand signatures.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.103
I've been up for 24 hours,

15:36.186 --> 15:37.563
I paid off a few people

15:37.646 --> 15:40.065
and I did a few things
in West Quahog I'm not proud of.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.359
(theme music playing)

15:45.821 --> 15:48.949
So, it's a show
about three hookers and their mom?

15:49.032 --> 15:52.452
This is very impressive,
but my decision stands.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.496
No!

15:54.746 --> 15:55.747
Come on, buddy,
you're leaving.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.625
No, I can't let Jasper down!

15:58.709 --> 16:00.919
-(gun cocking)
-I'm not going to let you sign that.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.171
Go on, get out of here!

16:04.923 --> 16:08.010
I should warn you,
I have a tiny bullet-proof shield,

16:08.093 --> 16:12.014
the exact size of a bullet,
somewhere on my body.

16:12.097 --> 16:16.643
And if you hit it, I'll be unharmed,
and your plan will be foiled.

16:16.727 --> 16:19.396
You'll be
the laughingstock of me.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.898
I don't want
to shoot you, Mayor West.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.233
Good, because I'm
incredibly crafty.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.360
Hey, what's that
on the ceiling?

16:25.444 --> 16:26.486
(laughing)

16:26.570 --> 16:27.863
Now I'm over here.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.705
Look, t-this has gotten
out of hand, I know.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.498
I--I--I don't want
anyone to get hurt.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.542
But you can put
an end to this right now

16:40.626 --> 16:42.503
by tearing up
that gay marriage ban.

16:42.586 --> 16:43.754
You won't break me.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.423
15 years ago
I swallowed everything I needed

16:46.507 --> 16:49.301
to escape
from a hostage situation.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.844
(hacking)

16:55.265 --> 16:56.934
(gasps)
A wall!

16:57.017 --> 16:58.143
Well, no matter.

16:58.227 --> 17:01.021
I'm prepared
for a lengthy captivity as well.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.481
(hacking)

17:03.565 --> 17:07.069
I swallowed
this People magazine in 1989.

17:07.152 --> 17:12.241
All right, Paul Hogan,
tell me about the real Crocodile Dundee.

17:14.952 --> 17:17.538
It's so nice
to have you home, dear.

17:17.621 --> 17:18.789
I can take it or leave it.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.250
God, this is such
an old-people house, you know.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.751
I mean,
look at this candy jar.

17:22.835 --> 17:24.086
Let's--Let's, uh,
take a look in here.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.004
Let's--Let's see
what you got here. You got...

17:26.088 --> 17:28.715
You got licorice.
Oh, that's, uh, that's...

17:28.799 --> 17:30.509
Oh, Freedent.
Oh, that's good.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.469
Yeah--Yeah,
I got a-- I got a sweet tooth,

17:32.553 --> 17:33.846
I think I'll have
some Freedent.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.390
Yeah. Oh.
Oh, what's this? Oh, a cough drop.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.141
A Luden's cough drop.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.353
Is that candy? No, I don't think
that's candy. I think it's a cough drop!

17:41.436 --> 17:43.814
Uh, what else we got?
Oh, oh, oh, look at-- look. Look at this.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.691
There's a fishing lure
in here.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.569
There's a fishing lure
in the candy jar.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.446
(stammers) What?
Am I supposed to eat this?

17:51.530 --> 17:54.491
Eat a fishing lure?
Hey, look, Brian's on TV.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.994
FEMALE REPORTER:
And now, some Channel 5 exclusive footage

17:57.077 --> 17:58.495
of the crazed
homosexual gunman

17:58.620 --> 18:00.330
who's taken
Mayor West hostage.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.623
Oh, my God!

18:01.707 --> 18:03.542
Brian's taken
the Mayor hostage?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.460
Is this an eyeglass lens?

18:05.544 --> 18:08.380
I didn't realize
how strongly he feels about this.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.673
(scoffs)
Gay marriage.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.383
Next thing you know,
they'll want to vote.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.468
Oh, oh, look at this.
A spare key

18:13.552 --> 18:15.721
for a Volkswagen Scirocco.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.598
They--They don't even
make this anymore.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.058
They don't even
make this car anymore.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.727
Whose key
could this possibly be?

18:21.894 --> 18:23.604
What if Brian's right?

18:23.687 --> 18:26.690
I mean, certainly the love between a man
and a woman should be sacred, but...

18:26.773 --> 18:29.151
Who's talking about love?
We're talking about marriage.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.903
Well, don't you love Mom?

18:31.069 --> 18:32.237
Come on, Lois, look at her.

18:32.321 --> 18:34.448
So two straight people
who hate each other

18:34.531 --> 18:36.033
have more of a right
to be together

18:36.116 --> 18:37.826
than two gay people
who love each other?

18:37.910 --> 18:39.953
That's what
we raised you to believe.

18:40.037 --> 18:42.998
Oh, my God!
I've made a terrible mistake!

18:43.081 --> 18:45.626
I've been brainwashed,
like Elizabeth Smart.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.045
It's so wonderful
having her home again.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.172
She's brought music
back into the house.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.882
Playing songs on the harp.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.718
Of course most of them
are about rape, but it's still nice.

18:56.053 --> 18:58.013
I think I made Brian crazy.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.057
Maybe I shouldn't have burned
that petition.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.017
Oh no, Chris,
you did the right thing.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.187
It's only a matter of time
before Mayor West signs that bill,

19:05.270 --> 19:06.813
and you'll get
to touch these.

19:06.897 --> 19:10.025
Oh, boy, I got a feeling
that before the end of the day,

19:10.108 --> 19:11.777
I'm going to be
burying my dog.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.780
Whoa, whoa. I said you could
touch my boobs. Let's start with that.

19:15.030 --> 19:18.283
Look, Peter, if you can't get Brian
to come out peacefully,

19:18.367 --> 19:19.618
we're going to
have to take him down.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.870
Don't worry, Joe,
I'm good with tight situations.

19:21.954 --> 19:24.164
Like when I saved
Luke Skywalker's life.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.000
Okay, Luke,
this'll keep you warm

19:27.084 --> 19:28.585
until I get
the shelter built.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.590
You're sure this is okay?

19:33.674 --> 19:35.259
Yeah, you're just
cutting into the fat.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.636
All right, Brian,
Peter's coming in!

19:38.428 --> 19:41.932
I'll relax him
by using my catchphrase.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.434
(mimics Italian accent)
Hey, what's up with you?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.103
(audience laughing)

19:47.479 --> 19:49.398
-What the hell was that?
-My catchphrase.

19:49.481 --> 19:50.649
You don't have a catchphrase.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.359
(mimics Italian accent)
Why you gotta say like that?

19:52.442 --> 19:54.778
(audience laughing)

19:54.862 --> 19:55.863
Excuse me.

19:55.988 --> 19:56.989
(hacks)

19:57.823 --> 19:59.950
Would anyone
like to play Stratego?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.285
I have Stratego.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.078
Oh, Peter, I never meant
for this to happen.

20:03.161 --> 20:06.707
This--This whole situation
has totally spiraled out of control.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.501
Brian, listen to me.
I was wrong.

20:09.585 --> 20:13.547
If two people love each other,
they should have the right to get married.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.341
But you have to come down
and give yourself up.

20:16.425 --> 20:17.843
If you drag this out
any longer,

20:17.926 --> 20:20.179
you're only hurting
your own cause.

20:21.096 --> 20:22.097
(sighs)

20:22.181 --> 20:24.224
She's right.
I'm sorry, Mayor West.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.102
Well, you were only doing
what you thought was right, Brian.

20:27.186 --> 20:30.397
And, hey, you've distracted everyone
from the Dig 'Em statue,

20:30.480 --> 20:33.442
so I guess we don't
need this bill anymore.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.406
(mimics Italian accent)
Everybody happy!

20:39.489 --> 20:42.201
(Bridal Chorus playing)

20:48.373 --> 20:50.584
Well, it sure was nice
of Mayor West

20:50.667 --> 20:52.377
to drop
the kidnapping charges.

20:52.461 --> 20:54.213
It's amazing.
All he asked for in return

20:54.296 --> 20:56.381
was the key
to a Volkswagen Scirocco.

20:56.465 --> 20:57.508
You're welcome.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.801
Listen, Lois,
I--I really appreciate

20:59.885 --> 21:01.303
you putting
your discomfort aside,

21:01.386 --> 21:02.596
so we could have
the wedding here.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.640
Oh, please,
I'm over all that now.

21:04.723 --> 21:07.392
Two men getting married
doesn't bother me in the least.

21:07.476 --> 21:08.727
They deserve happiness.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.771
(mimics Italian accent)
Everybody gay!

21:10.854 --> 21:13.565
(laughing)

21:16.485 --> 21:18.695
(theme music playing)
