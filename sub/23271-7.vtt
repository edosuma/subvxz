WEBVTT

01:45.605 --> 01:46.439
Yeah

01:47.398 --> 01:50.110
Yo, you heard?
Demons be real, that's the word

01:50.193 --> 01:53.154
Over here, out there
Demons be lurkin' everywhere

01:53.238 --> 01:56.407
What form is they takin'?
Tell me how they look,

01:56.491 --> 01:58.827
Hell if I know, but they got me shook,

01:58.910 --> 02:00.411
They demons, so they evil,

02:00.495 --> 02:01.913
Demons is as demons do

02:01.996 --> 02:04.916
Make them ugly grills illegal,
Demons is as demons do

02:04.999 --> 02:07.168
Steal, destroy, murder, spy,
no rules apply

02:07.252 --> 02:10.547
Stackin' paper by dirty deeds,
Where you and I can't see

02:10.630 --> 02:15.301
But look, tons of people in the world,
already doin' that, actually

02:15.385 --> 02:16.928
So what's the dilly up in here?

02:17.011 --> 02:19.889
You and demons, demons and I,
How we gonna draw dat fine line?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.934
Don't nobody nowhere,
Know the difference no more

02:23.017 --> 02:23.977
Not you, not me

02:24.060 --> 02:26.020
-But I ain't gonna be no demon
-You sure?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.564
-You a demon?
-Hell no

02:27.647 --> 02:31.943
Yeah, you say that, but I don't know
I only know me, and how I roll

02:32.026 --> 02:34.904
Not out to please peeps,
Just out to protect me

02:34.988 --> 02:37.782
Mess around,
Might get shanked from the back

02:37.866 --> 02:40.994
Let that guard down,
Might get took for all your bank

02:41.077 --> 02:43.997
The cullin' of the weak,
Shit ain't never gonna change

02:44.080 --> 02:47.000
The cullin' of the weak,
Shit ain't never gonna change

02:47.083 --> 02:50.003
The ones that get shook,
Get guns and hit the streets

02:50.086 --> 02:53.131
But most ain't shook,
And ain't packin' no heat

02:53.214 --> 02:55.758
Last mistake they'll ever make,
'Cuz with guns at stake

02:55.842 --> 02:57.635
The first to grab are the worst of us

02:57.719 --> 03:00.180
Shots pop off,
The first to die are the best of us

03:00.263 --> 03:01.931
Nobody knows friend from foe

03:02.015 --> 03:04.809
Gettin' tested as we should
To stay human fo' sho'

03:04.893 --> 03:06.394
Needle o' truth
Haystack o' doubt

03:06.477 --> 03:07.729
Chain reaction goes blaow!

03:07.812 --> 03:09.606
Needle o' truth
Haystack o' doubt

03:09.689 --> 03:11.399
Chain reaction goes blaow!

03:11.482 --> 03:14.444
WEAK HUMANS,
WISE DEMONS

03:15.862 --> 03:19.365
Make no mistake,
demons are stronger than humans.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.286
However, humans have survived
many times before

03:23.369 --> 03:29.250
in the face of
physically superior enemies.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.211
I have no doubt the war against demonkind

03:32.754 --> 03:34.714
will see humanity triumph again!

03:34.797 --> 03:36.174
Wooo, Ryo!

03:36.758 --> 03:38.176
Humans forever!

03:38.259 --> 03:39.719
Death to all demons!

03:39.802 --> 03:42.513
You can't fool me!
You're all demons!

03:44.474 --> 03:46.226
I know it!

03:47.185 --> 03:49.312
There are no humans anymore!

03:57.528 --> 03:58.363
No.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.449
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.942
Ryo, I just saw someone get killed.

04:36.985 --> 04:37.819
I see.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.737
He was a human.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.907
He was crazy, but he wasn't a demon.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.534
I see.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.160
Ryo,

04:46.577 --> 04:48.246
how are you so calm?

04:48.955 --> 04:52.542
Tons of people who aren't demons
are dying right now.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.546
Some demons have died, too.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.551
Akira.
This is a war between demons and humans.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.805
-And every war has casualties.
- You knew this would happen?

05:05.888 --> 05:08.266
This amount of sacrifice is unavoidable.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.937
It takes time and effort
to prove someone isn't a demon.

05:13.021 --> 05:17.275
What's going to change by you going around
and saving one or two people?

05:17.358 --> 05:20.903
The big picture stays the same.
Leave it to the government.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.698
Are you saying just
stand by and do nothing?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.491
-It's a necessary evil.
-Ryo!

05:25.825 --> 05:29.120
You can't say that
if there's human blood in your veins.

05:29.871 --> 05:34.334
It just means humans are more vulnerable
than I thought they were.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.837
Some sacrifice is inevitable.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.214
No, it's not!

06:16.959 --> 06:19.545
I told you to stay put. Here.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.343
How long do I have to hide out
in a tiny place like this?

06:26.302 --> 06:27.678
It's a mess down there.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.058
Everyone knows your face.
You'd get hunted down right away.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.062
It's your fault
everyone knows what I am now.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.650
There must be other Devilmen besides us.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.945
Kill me if it's just the two of us.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.572
If I bring more, think we can live here?

06:47.573 --> 06:50.118
That place looks bigger than here.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.079
But it attracts too much attention.

06:53.579 --> 06:57.083
This place isn't even big enough
for me to stretch my legs.

06:57.708 --> 07:01.087
But if it's just to sleep,
I can stay here till whenever.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.631
Even though the elevator doesn't work.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.591
Sorry. Thanks.

07:08.136 --> 07:12.348
"And one of them with Jesus stretched out
his hand, and drew his sword,

07:13.099 --> 07:17.270
and struck a servant of the high priest's,
and smote off his ear.

07:18.020 --> 07:22.733
Then said Jesus unto him,
put up again thy sword into his place,

07:23.401 --> 07:27.238
for all they that take the sword
shall perish with the sword."

07:28.197 --> 07:30.950
Does that mean we shouldn't fight?

07:31.742 --> 07:35.913
That's right. If swords are crossed,
life will always be sacrificed.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.332
So what are we supposed to do?

07:38.916 --> 07:40.418
Love. We use love.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.628
Is that strong?

07:43.212 --> 07:44.505
It's strong.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.883
It's the strongest thing in the world.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.677
-No! Stop it!
-Take that.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.514
This huge love will wrap you up, Taro.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.432
Quit it!

07:55.683 --> 07:57.185
Cut it out. Jeez.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.483
There's a lot less people now.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.319
It's no time to come to track.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.822
Miko hasn't even been to school.

08:10.656 --> 08:14.160
Who cares? She's been stuck up
ever since she got faster.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.330
Looks like Miki can't even beat a dog.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.166
I feel like running's pointless now.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.336
Humans aren't made
for running to begin with.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.962
Then how about demons?

08:25.046 --> 08:26.047
Maybe they fly.

08:28.132 --> 08:28.966
I guess.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.556
It's easy
to give people the cold shoulder.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.226
But it's really hard to understand them.

08:39.310 --> 08:43.606
Sometimes you'll even find a new side
to family you've known for years.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.442
No matter how hard you hope,

08:46.526 --> 08:50.613
it's sad to think about
not understanding anyone your entire life.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.949
But I want to understand.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.244
I pray I want to keep understanding.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.496
I'll find the courage to believe.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.749
WHY IS SHE PREACHING?

09:01.832 --> 09:05.002
PATHETIC.
STOP PRETENDING TO BE A GOOD GIRL.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.724
Hey, girl.
The way you breathe sure is sexy.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.478
Want to work up a good sweat with me next?

09:32.947 --> 09:33.948
Just like that.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.367
I'm gonna come.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.327
It's been long enough, right?

10:19.493 --> 10:22.163
I'm kinda tired
of my grandma's special view.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.343
Hey, wait.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.764
It's odd for a girl to be
walking around on her own.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.267
Is it normal for guys
to hang out and walk around?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.229
Those eyes. You a foreigner?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.774
She's Miki Makimura.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.777
The witch of the track. She's a mix.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.238
-Hey.
-Come with us. We need to check you out.

10:57.281 --> 10:58.282
Let me go!

10:58.366 --> 10:59.283
Let me go!

10:59.825 --> 11:01.911
Foreigner! Foreigner!

11:02.453 --> 11:03.287
Stop it!

11:03.871 --> 11:07.208
What the hell?
Look, he's crying like a little girl.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.292
Cut it out!

11:08.542 --> 11:09.377
What an idiot.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.717
Miki,
I'll be there whenever you're in trouble.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.558
Maybe you can run so fast
because you're a demon.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.061
This is for Japan!

11:27.144 --> 11:28.938
Help! Akira!

11:30.606 --> 11:31.440
Akira.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.651
So, we meet again.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.486
You.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.821
You're on her side?

11:39.240 --> 11:42.410
Stop bullying the weak
and go get the demons.

11:46.455 --> 11:47.957
Uh-oh. Here comes more.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.333
Let's run.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.836
Hey, wait a sec.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.512
No wonder they call you a witch.
You're fast.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.347
You, too. You're strong.

12:03.973 --> 12:08.352
Being weak gets you in trouble.
You need to be able to protect yourself.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.771
A girl walking all alone...

12:11.313 --> 12:12.648
Where's your mermaid?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.776
That's Akira Fudo.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.778
Remember his name.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.118
There! It's a demon!
Close off the roads!

12:25.077 --> 12:29.039
Don't hold back! Shoot it!
Fall back. The flamethrower's here.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.041
Is this--?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.251
Die, you demon!

12:32.334 --> 12:34.336
Eat that!

12:35.379 --> 12:37.506
Kill that thing!

12:37.590 --> 12:38.507
Kill it!

12:38.591 --> 12:39.508
Die, demon!

12:39.592 --> 12:40.468
Kill it!

12:40.551 --> 12:42.803
-Don't let it escape!
-Burn it! Do it!

12:45.681 --> 12:48.642
You're not a demon.
You're a Devilman, aren't you?

12:49.185 --> 12:51.145
It's okay. Come with me.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.648
I'm also a Devilman, too.
I have a human heart.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.650
Stop! I'm on your side!

12:58.694 --> 12:59.737
Shoot!

13:00.362 --> 13:01.197
Stop!

13:07.077 --> 13:09.872
There's another one!
Launch to the upper right!

13:12.750 --> 13:14.793
Why are you killing like this?

13:15.377 --> 13:16.253
Why?!

13:30.226 --> 13:32.686
Who is it? I know you're there.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.691
You're alive?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.277
You were in the 4-by-100 relay.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.697
Since you already saw me...

13:56.544 --> 13:57.461
Now you see me.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.964
A fellow demon.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.425
The current circumstances
are in our favor.

14:03.926 --> 14:08.097
-How are things with the U.S. military?
-We already control them.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.225
There are enough of them
to destroy the human race.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.727
Can we not mass-produce weapons...

14:13.811 --> 14:14.645
DEMON COUNCIL

14:14.728 --> 14:18.649
-...and arm the public with them?
-We can't legislate it in time.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.110
Beyond that,
there are too many cases

14:21.193 --> 14:24.238
where civilians murdering other civilians.

14:24.738 --> 14:28.117
The government must exterminate
this problem at the root.

14:28.325 --> 14:32.329
What about a military draft?
People won't complain if we do it now.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.165
We must be mindful
of our neighboring nations.

14:35.249 --> 14:39.044
Intel suggests they've already
been overrun by the demons.

14:39.128 --> 14:43.090
Where does that intel come from?
What is it based on?

14:43.173 --> 14:45.509
Rather than immigrating humans,

14:45.593 --> 14:47.761
maybe cargo is more dangerous.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.264
They're falling for the demons' trap.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.684
Come in. I'll pour some tea for you.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.145
Sweet. Nice place.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.146
Thanks.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.856
Miki. Look at this.

15:01.358 --> 15:04.236
ANTI-DEMON
DEMON-CONTROL

15:04.320 --> 15:07.281
DEMON-REPELLENT SPRAY

15:17.833 --> 15:18.667
What's wrong?

15:19.877 --> 15:23.047
It's all right.
I won't let any demons get you.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.298
Mrs. Makimura.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.801
Did you hear about Saori Otani?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.887
She was a demon.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.680
What? Saori?

15:32.181 --> 15:35.059
The police took Mrs. Otani, too.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.063
-They think the parents might be demons.
-That can't be.

15:39.855 --> 15:44.151
But how could she not have noticed
her own daughter was a demon?

15:44.652 --> 15:47.988
Oh, she knew, alright.
She just didn't say anything.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.323
That's horrific.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.409
That means my child was associating
with a demon?

15:52.493 --> 15:53.744
How terrifying.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.623
Taro?

16:02.127 --> 16:04.046
Taro! Answer right now!

16:04.129 --> 16:05.089
Taro!

16:05.756 --> 16:06.799
Mom.

16:07.549 --> 16:10.344
Don't disappear like that. You scared me.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.598
I'm sorry, Mom.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.184
That's all right. Next time...

16:20.729 --> 16:23.691
I'm sorry. I wanted meat.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.694
I couldn't help myself.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.115
DEMONS RELATIVE TO POPULATION

16:39.039 --> 16:39.999
We need to talk.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.587
Akira. The world has changed.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.507
An age of horror has begun.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.969
Humans are being made
to dance the dance of deadly hell.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.180
We exposed the existence of demons.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.684
But we've opened Pandora's box
at the same time.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.686
Humans get scared.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.938
Humans are scared.

17:04.064 --> 17:09.737
Don't you see? Humans are weak.
What do you think will come of a humanity

17:09.820 --> 17:12.990
terrified by the discovery
of demons' existence?

17:13.073 --> 17:17.161
Demons are strong and cunning.
They will bide their time patiently.

17:17.244 --> 17:21.165
They are calmly watching
as humans doubt and kill each other.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.668
Humans have the courage to
conquer fear and fight.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.671
They have intelligence. Powerful armies.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.049
They can fight the demons.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.260
Let's hope so.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.139
But millions of humans
are being sacrificed

17:37.222 --> 17:39.767
to kill just a few hundred demons.

17:40.267 --> 17:45.064
The weapons that are supposed to protect
humans are helping to destroy them.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.442
Humans that get lost in their suspicions

17:48.525 --> 17:50.527
will start doing terrible things.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.573
There's nothing you can do
with your own power alone.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.450
You should keep quiet.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.828
Things would be better
if your only enemies

18:00.245 --> 18:04.875
were demons, but the Devilman himself
is a demon from a human point of view.

18:06.043 --> 18:09.463
This is the biggest show in history!
The war is starting.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.216
A war against a form of life

18:12.424 --> 18:14.468
unknown to human experience!

18:15.052 --> 18:17.429
What can you accomplish fighting alone?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.931
Don't get overconfident.

18:19.014 --> 18:23.560
You should keep yourself hidden
and observe the future of humanity.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.271
Killing one or two demons

18:26.355 --> 18:28.982
means nothing
in the grand scheme of things.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.778
Humanity will self-destruct.
Every single one of them will die.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.030
Humans won't self-destruct.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.741
I'm not the only Devilman.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.453
There are others with human hearts
who defeated their demons.

18:44.164 --> 18:48.043
We shouldn't be apart.
I'm going to gather the Devilmen.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.547
-Together we'll fight the demons.
-No.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.509
That's not why I made you a Devilman.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.803
It's over, Ryo.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.221
Wait, Akira.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.141
Get out of my way, Ryo!

19:08.188 --> 19:09.773
It backfired.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.316
Akira.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.569
Please, stay alive.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.490
The Revelation...

19:19.241 --> 19:23.203
The god of demons, Satan,
lost his body in the war with the Lord.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.373
After an eternity, he rose from nothing

19:27.207 --> 19:30.169
and led a demon army
that brought hell from the sky.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.172
Yet the army of God
defeated them once more.

19:34.047 --> 19:34.965
The army of God?

19:36.091 --> 19:36.925
Satan?

19:39.219 --> 19:40.179
I'm back.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.932
Akira, look at this!

19:45.475 --> 19:48.103
Noel, thank you for everything.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.318
I'm taking Taro and leaving.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.944
I love you.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.238
And Miki and Taro and Akira, too.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.450
I'm glad we were able
to be a happy family.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.454
I'm sorry I can't fulfill my promise.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.498
I leave Miki in your hands.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.877
MIKI, I'M SORRY AS A MOTHER.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.462
LOOK AFTER DAD.
LOVE, MOM

20:14.004 --> 20:15.339
Your mom left?

20:15.756 --> 20:17.216
Taro is with her, too.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.801
-I'll go look for them.
-Me, too.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.721
No, stay.
Someone needs to be here for her

20:22.804 --> 20:24.640
in case she comes back.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.268
Akira, look after Miki.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.229
You have my word.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.523
You've changed.
You're not the old Akira.

20:34.107 --> 20:34.942
Uncle.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.236
Be careful.

20:38.153 --> 20:41.114
I'll be all right. God will watch over me.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.838
Breaking news.
The president of the United States just

20:56.922 --> 20:59.508
declared a state of national emergency.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.678
The Department of National Defense
closed borders

21:02.761 --> 21:06.848
in the wake of suspicions that
the demons are a Russian bioweapon.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.351
The Seventh Fleet has been dispatched

21:09.434 --> 21:12.604
and orders are underway
to deploy all NATO forces.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.610
Will it come to combat?

21:18.694 --> 21:23.198
If both sides launch nuclear weapons,
we'll all die, not just the demons.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.201
They must realize that, too, no?

21:29.496 --> 21:31.790
They certainly do. Which is why...

21:33.709 --> 21:36.211
we're going to launch our own attack.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.260
We'll use the tactical nuclear weapon.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.220
Let's get this party started!

21:45.762 --> 21:46.722
Yes, sir!

22:01.194 --> 22:02.154
What's going on?

22:02.237 --> 22:04.239
What's that?

22:13.874 --> 22:17.794
The men of Sodom, compassed
the house round, and called unto Lot,

22:18.378 --> 22:22.507
"Where are the men which
came in to thee this night?"

22:23.425 --> 22:27.220
And they pressed sore upon Lot,
and came near to break the door.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.224
Alas, the Lord saw their deeds,
and in his judgment

22:31.350 --> 22:33.560
resolved to overthrow those cities.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.521
Then, against the will of the Lord,

22:37.105 --> 22:41.318
his wife looked back from behind him,
and she became a pillar of salt.

22:42.527 --> 22:48.033
Then the Lord rained upon Sodom
and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire

22:48.116 --> 22:50.452
from the Lord out of heaven.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.455
And he overthrew those cities,
and all the plain,

22:53.538 --> 22:56.833
and that which grew upon the ground.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.169
Look at this.

22:59.252 --> 23:02.255
It's an image taken
from the satellite track.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.133
-My God...
- The light's diameter...

23:05.217 --> 23:08.095
is more than 10,000 km
and at present...

24:31.428 --> 24:33.430
