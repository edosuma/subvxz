00:00.272 --> 00:01.673
Previously on Once Upon A Time...

00:02.437 --> 00:05.134
- This is avoiding me.
- I now, I just feel too guilty.

00:05.186 --> 00:06.225
Be patient.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.558
My feelings for you are real.

00:09.592 --> 00:10.693
But Marian is my wife.

00:10.727 --> 00:11.743
She's a monster.

00:12.131 --> 00:13.699
Maybe you don't
know me as well as you think.

00:13.734 --> 00:16.635
Regina, we've been trying to
find you. We need to talk about...

00:16.670 --> 00:19.104
give me two weeks.
Misthaven is a short journey.

00:19.138 --> 00:20.973
What do we even know
about this... Misthaven?

00:21.007 --> 00:22.908
You might know it better
by what the inhabitants call it.

00:22.942 --> 00:24.542
The enchanted forest.

00:24.577 --> 00:25.844
We have to go after her.

00:31.450 --> 00:33.752
Don't worry, Anna.

00:33.786 --> 00:36.621
I will find you.

00:53.706 --> 00:57.909
Until we're together,
no one leaves this town.

01:10.622 --> 01:15.592
Anna, I will find out what happened to you.

01:34.045 --> 01:35.912
Can I help you?

01:35.947 --> 01:38.114
I hope so. Are you David?

01:38.149 --> 01:39.515
Yes.

01:39.550 --> 01:42.152
Yes, I am.

01:52.763 --> 01:55.164
so, anyway, I got your name

01:55.198 --> 01:57.834
from an old friend of yours...

01:57.868 --> 01:59.201
From Arendelle.

01:59.235 --> 02:01.203
Arendelle? You know Kristoff?

02:01.237 --> 02:03.272
What makes you think it's Kristoff?

02:03.306 --> 02:06.275
He's the only person from Arendelle I know.

02:06.309 --> 02:07.276
Okay.

02:07.310 --> 02:09.178
He didn't tell me that.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.728
Hard to be on a secret mission

02:10.728 --> 02:11.806
when you don't have all the facts.

02:11.969 --> 02:13.115
What's the mission?

02:13.149 --> 02:14.816
I just told you it's secret.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.552
But he told me I could trust you...

02:17.587 --> 02:18.854
just not with the mission.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.388
Okay.

02:20.422 --> 02:22.090
What's your name?

02:22.124 --> 02:23.925
Joan.

02:25.761 --> 02:27.128
Your name's not Joan.

02:28.197 --> 02:29.297
You're smart, too.

02:29.331 --> 02:30.966
[Chuckles that's good.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.803
See, I have to give a
false name for your safety.

02:34.837 --> 02:36.070
You're wanted?

02:36.105 --> 02:37.805
Look, I don't know if
I can be more clear...

02:37.839 --> 02:39.007
secret mission, your safety.

02:39.041 --> 02:42.243
Let me start over.

02:42.277 --> 02:45.546
- I'm Joan. Can I sleep in your barn?
- Sure, Joan.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.382
Anything for Kristoff's fiancÃ©e.

02:49.485 --> 02:51.319
The ring.

02:52.888 --> 02:54.187
Congratulations.

02:54.222 --> 02:55.523
Thanks.

02:55.557 --> 02:57.691
Well, I guess I'll find out
your name at the wedding.

02:57.726 --> 02:58.792
Uh, the barn's out back.

02:58.827 --> 03:00.460
You can stay the night.

03:01.496 --> 03:03.597
You should hurry and get inside.

03:03.632 --> 03:04.832
This is a bad time.

03:04.866 --> 03:06.366
Who's that?

03:07.536 --> 03:09.936
That is someone you
don't want to mess with.

03:11.005 --> 03:13.740
They call her Bo Peep.

03:15.243 --> 03:17.610
Here you go, sweetheart.

03:17.645 --> 03:21.014
I'll see you in three hours
for your midnight shrieking.

03:21.049 --> 03:22.282
Yes, I will.

03:22.316 --> 03:25.585
Ohh. Sweet dreams.

03:25.619 --> 03:27.754
What do you suppose babies dream about?

03:27.788 --> 03:29.221
Bullfighting. Laser tag.

03:29.256 --> 03:30.356
That's not true.

03:30.390 --> 03:32.124
I think they're joking.

03:32.159 --> 03:33.392
Right.

03:33.427 --> 03:35.161
I'll recognize funny again when he's 3

03:35.195 --> 03:36.228
and I've had some sleep.

03:36.263 --> 03:37.329
3?

03:37.364 --> 03:40.433
I see the optimism returning.

03:41.435 --> 03:45.071
Okay, chocolate, DVDs, ice cream.

03:45.105 --> 03:46.205
Red wine?

03:46.239 --> 03:48.107
That's one heck of a
late-night snack, kid.

03:48.141 --> 03:50.342
It's for my mom.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.244
I don't drink and sheriff.

03:52.279 --> 03:53.279
My other mom.

03:53.313 --> 03:55.747
I googled "how to get over a breakup."

03:55.782 --> 03:56.882
It didn't talk about

03:56.916 --> 03:58.917
your boyfriend's wife time-traveling

03:58.952 --> 03:59.985
back from the past,

04:00.019 --> 04:01.620
but close enough.

04:01.654 --> 04:02.888
That's really sweet.

04:05.424 --> 04:06.858
What the...

04:15.534 --> 04:16.666
It's a message.

04:23.842 --> 04:25.843
It's for Henry. It's from your mother.

04:35.153 --> 04:37.254
She doesn't want to see me.

04:45.797 --> 04:47.397
You know, that is not
exactly what she said.

04:47.432 --> 04:48.665
I read the note.

04:48.699 --> 04:52.302
She said for right now, while
she's dealing with things.

04:52.337 --> 04:54.438
She doesn't want to see me.

04:54.472 --> 04:58.675
She's in a lot of pain over Robin Hood

04:58.709 --> 05:01.111
well, forever.

05:01.146 --> 05:03.747
Things have been tough on her and you.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.115
She's trying to fix them

05:05.149 --> 05:07.150
so that you two can be together...

05:07.184 --> 05:08.718
Because she cares about you.

05:10.554 --> 05:12.689
So why'd she tell me to stay away?

05:12.723 --> 05:15.058
Because she thinks
she's making things better.

05:16.861 --> 05:17.927
She's not.

05:28.472 --> 05:30.973
What the hell?

05:31.007 --> 05:33.942
Emma, I-I'm
getting calls from all over.

05:33.977 --> 05:35.611
It's a town-wide blackout.

05:35.646 --> 05:37.213
Yeah, copy that. I'm looking at it.

05:37.247 --> 05:39.347
I'll swing by to get you.
We can check this out.

05:42.351 --> 05:44.119
Hey, kid.

05:44.154 --> 05:45.688
You want to come along on this one?

05:45.722 --> 05:48.423
We can call it operation... Nightshade

05:48.457 --> 05:50.926
or, uh, blackthorn or...

05:50.960 --> 05:52.561
That's okay.

05:54.830 --> 05:57.865
He wouldn't even
let me hug him. It killed me.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.401
Sounds familiar.

05:59.435 --> 06:00.768
'Cause I do that. Great.

06:00.803 --> 06:01.836
I've passed it along.

06:01.870 --> 06:03.071
Not just you.

06:03.105 --> 06:06.074
Henry has two moms who both put up walls.

06:06.108 --> 06:08.610
Sounds like he's taking
after the both of you.

06:08.644 --> 06:10.445
It's not like him to pass
up on operation anything.

06:10.479 --> 06:11.478
I'm worried.

06:11.513 --> 06:14.615
Well, kids have extreme reactions.

06:14.649 --> 06:15.649
They get over it fast.

06:15.684 --> 06:18.352
Just stay strong and roll with it.

06:18.386 --> 06:19.587
There's always people in this world

06:19.621 --> 06:20.621
who want you to give up.

06:20.655 --> 06:23.958
Don't make their jobs any easier.

06:25.293 --> 06:26.293
What the hell?

06:26.328 --> 06:28.862
Well, there you go.

06:36.070 --> 06:37.804
Whatever happened to these power lines

06:37.839 --> 06:39.406
happened after the snow monster.

06:41.755 --> 06:43.344
Let's go find whoever did this.

07:02.885 --> 07:06.354
- Why?
- Well, just come on in, I guess.

07:06.389 --> 07:08.456
Oh, look at the baby...

07:08.491 --> 07:09.624
Thanks.

07:09.659 --> 07:10.992
Is what I'd say if I
could look at the baby.

07:11.026 --> 07:12.059
But I can't.

07:12.094 --> 07:13.494
Why? 'Cause it's dark.

07:13.513 --> 07:14.533
Know what else we can't look at?

07:14.533 --> 07:16.514
The Internet, TV, my clock.

07:16.514 --> 07:17.292
Happy's right.

07:17.363 --> 07:18.212
Power's out.

07:18.983 --> 07:20.734
So what are you gonna
do about it, sister?

07:20.769 --> 07:22.069
Me?

07:22.104 --> 07:24.405
I think you mean Regina, the mayor.

07:24.439 --> 07:26.240
She doesn't want the job anymore.

07:26.275 --> 07:27.541
This is your curse.

07:27.575 --> 07:29.209
You are the mayor now.

07:29.243 --> 07:30.911
I am?

07:30.945 --> 07:32.579
We helped you take your
kingdom back... remember?

07:32.614 --> 07:34.448
So you could rule.

07:34.482 --> 07:36.417
Well, this is your kingdom now.

07:36.451 --> 07:37.564
So rule it.

07:41.389 --> 07:42.856
In case you were wondering,

07:42.890 --> 07:44.557
it goes the whole way 'round.

07:44.591 --> 07:46.323
Hook, I didn't know you were joining us.

07:46.323 --> 07:47.994
I get a distress call from a fair maiden,

07:48.029 --> 07:49.062
and I'm on the spot.

07:49.096 --> 07:51.298
I was not distressed, and you're saying

07:51.332 --> 07:53.280
this wall goes around
what... the whole town?

07:53.280 --> 07:54.150
And that it does.

07:54.150 --> 07:56.803
So, once again, we can't leave Storybrooke.

07:56.838 --> 07:58.471
Doing more than keeping us inside,

07:58.505 --> 07:59.572
by the looks of that.

07:59.606 --> 08:02.842
Guess that's what caused the loss of power.

08:02.876 --> 08:05.077
Look at you becoming a 21st-century man.

08:05.111 --> 08:06.346
Yeah.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.032
It looks to me like whoever
was putting up the wall

08:08.032 --> 08:09.190
wasn't trying to take out the lights.

08:09.190 --> 08:10.395
They were just putting up the wall.

08:10.395 --> 08:12.284
To keep us in... why?

08:12.319 --> 08:13.953
Kill us all one by one.

08:13.987 --> 08:14.987
It's what I'd do.

08:19.159 --> 08:20.226
Oh.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.522
I should have brought the champagne.

08:21.522 --> 08:22.368
What?

08:22.368 --> 08:23.760
To celebrate our second date.

08:24.512 --> 08:26.610
And because we've got
the world's largest ice bucket.

08:26.610 --> 08:27.662
Second date?

08:28.034 --> 08:29.534
Did I miss the first?

08:29.569 --> 08:31.303
Aye. The snow monster's the first.

08:31.338 --> 08:32.504
Ice wall's the second.

08:32.538 --> 08:36.107
After all, if I only
count the quiet dinners,

08:36.140 --> 08:37.708
we wouldn't even get one.

08:41.113 --> 08:44.383
I think I see something by the wall.

08:44.417 --> 08:46.150
You wait here with your ice bucket

08:46.185 --> 08:48.420
while I check that out.

08:52.724 --> 08:54.792
I think it's time You
and I have a little talk

08:54.826 --> 08:56.660
about your intentions with my daughter.

08:56.695 --> 08:58.897
That's a little old-fashioned,
even by my standards,

08:58.931 --> 09:00.865
and I still pay with doubloons.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.902
Oh, remember, I know your reputation.

09:03.936 --> 09:05.736
Emma is not some conquest.

09:05.771 --> 09:09.973
I wouldn't risk my life
for someone I see as loot.

09:10.008 --> 09:14.678
Whatever we become,
It's up to her as much as me.

09:25.589 --> 09:26.589
Hey.

09:26.624 --> 09:28.292
Who are you?

09:28.326 --> 09:29.759
My name is Elsa.

09:29.794 --> 09:32.495
Okay, Elsa. It's okay.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.041
I'm Emma.

09:34.271 --> 09:35.838
You want to tell me what
you're doing out here?

09:35.838 --> 09:37.894
You have something to do with this... Wall?

09:38.212 --> 09:39.745
I'm looking for someone... my sister.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.513
I can't find her.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.348
This was hers.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.787
I found it in the store filled with things.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.288
Where is she?

09:49.322 --> 09:53.258
I have no idea, but if you want me
to help you, you have to help me.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.660
What's her name?

09:57.630 --> 09:59.931
Anna.

10:06.005 --> 10:09.774
"Do you want
a glass of tea, Bo Peep?

10:09.809 --> 10:12.677
How about a cookie, Bo Peep?"

10:12.712 --> 10:14.245
You're not here for tea.

10:14.279 --> 10:16.247
Well, the boy's got that right.

10:16.281 --> 10:17.248
Who's that?

10:17.282 --> 10:19.650
My name is Joan.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.352
Adorable.

10:23.655 --> 10:25.957
You know me, Ruth. You know what I want.

10:27.492 --> 10:28.859
My payment.

10:28.893 --> 10:30.094
Your extortion.

10:30.128 --> 10:31.729
Call it what you like,

10:31.763 --> 10:35.065
but you and your flock are safe

10:35.100 --> 10:37.134
as long as you pay me what's due.

10:38.169 --> 10:39.870
It's... it's been a slow month.

10:39.904 --> 10:41.706
How about this...

10:41.740 --> 10:45.109
you just figure out how to
pay me what you owe me

10:45.143 --> 10:47.611
by tomorrow at noon.

10:47.645 --> 10:49.379
We... you've got to
give us more time.

10:49.413 --> 10:51.348
I don't give anything.

10:51.382 --> 10:55.219
But perhaps if you
hand over your steed,

10:55.253 --> 10:56.787
I'll allow another day. No. No deal.

10:56.821 --> 10:58.922
That... that horse
never leaves my side.

10:58.957 --> 11:01.491
Then tomorrow, when I come back,

11:01.525 --> 11:05.194
if there's no payment, you keep the horse,

11:05.229 --> 11:06.470
and I take your farm.

11:09.433 --> 11:12.101
And you can work off
your debts as my slaves.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.537
Mother, we don't need this.

11:14.572 --> 11:15.672
Let's go.

11:15.706 --> 11:17.440
We can leave this
place and start over...

11:23.747 --> 11:26.149
You can't go anywhere.

11:26.183 --> 11:28.284
You're branded now.

11:28.318 --> 11:31.587
This stick is how I find my flock,

11:31.621 --> 11:35.591
and you're now one of my sheep.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.593
And if you don't like it,

11:37.627 --> 11:39.261
pay me what you owe me,

11:39.296 --> 11:44.500
or this farm and your lives are mine.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.942
You're not seriously going
to actually work the farm

11:53.976 --> 11:55.310
for that... that bully.

11:55.344 --> 11:58.146
That bully is the most
powerful warlord in the region.

11:58.181 --> 12:00.015
So you're okay being her slaves?

12:00.049 --> 12:02.066
Until we work it off.
What choice do we have?

12:02.066 --> 12:03.361
You could fight.

12:03.725 --> 12:04.627
She has an army.

12:04.627 --> 12:06.754
I'm sorry, but why fight
a battle you can't win?

12:06.789 --> 12:09.156
Those are exactly the
battles you should fight.

12:09.191 --> 12:10.758
If you know you could
win, it's not a fight.

12:10.793 --> 12:13.994
If it's impossible, you
have to fight to achieve it.

12:14.029 --> 12:15.930
Spoken like a naive young girl.

12:15.964 --> 12:17.131
Right.

12:17.165 --> 12:19.261
I am a young girl, and
I'm missing my own wedding

12:19.261 --> 12:21.002
to go to a strange land and track down...

12:21.770 --> 12:25.940
some secret-mission things.

12:25.974 --> 12:27.407
And you're a great, big grown man

12:27.442 --> 12:29.210
who doesn't even have to leave his own home

12:29.244 --> 12:30.544
to tackle some random bully.

12:31.612 --> 12:33.314
I'm a Shepherd, Joan.

12:33.348 --> 12:35.782
Sure, if someone picks a
fight with me in a tavern,

12:35.817 --> 12:36.817
I can hold my own.

12:36.852 --> 12:39.153
This is a warlord with a private army.

12:39.187 --> 12:40.854
What good are my fists against that?

12:40.888 --> 12:42.456
Maybe try a sword.

12:43.958 --> 12:45.959
I don't know what Arendelle is like,

12:45.993 --> 12:47.828
but here in the enchanted forest,

12:47.862 --> 12:49.796
most farmers don't do
a lot of sword-fighting.

12:49.831 --> 12:52.699
Well, if it's help with a
sword you need, that I can do.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.661
How? Kristoff show you?

12:56.066 --> 12:58.597
'Cause using an ice pick to
shave cubes for cool beverages

12:59.129 --> 13:00.163
is pretty different.

13:00.163 --> 13:01.959
He didn't teach me.
I learned from my soldiers.

13:03.410 --> 13:04.844
M-my family's sold...

13:04.879 --> 13:07.713
some soldiers I met at a place one time,

13:07.748 --> 13:09.182
and I can teach you.

13:10.684 --> 13:12.218
What do you have to lose?

13:14.454 --> 13:16.822
You can always give up tomorrow.

13:23.096 --> 13:24.062
Emma!

13:24.097 --> 13:25.364
Stay back.

13:26.209 --> 13:27.563
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no. Stay back.

13:27.563 --> 13:29.213
It's okay. She's just trying to find...

13:34.640 --> 13:36.108
Emma!

14:05.170 --> 14:06.637
The device... call her.

14:07.957 --> 14:09.733
Emma, are you in there?

14:11.064 --> 14:12.331
I'm getting her out.

14:18.372 --> 14:20.239
What if we lift?

14:26.413 --> 14:27.613
Don't!

14:27.647 --> 14:28.714
We're not giving up.

14:28.748 --> 14:30.549
We won't, but this is
not getting us anywhere.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.684
Well, I'm open to suggestions.

14:32.719 --> 14:34.253
Magic made this thing.

14:34.287 --> 14:37.556
I think we're gonna
need magic to unmake it.

14:37.590 --> 14:39.658
And I'm not gonna stop
fighting until we do.

14:47.166 --> 14:49.401
You're doing great.

14:55.074 --> 14:57.042
All right.

15:00.479 --> 15:01.413
All right.

15:11.524 --> 15:12.957
Aah!

15:14.993 --> 15:16.161
You're getting there.

15:16.195 --> 15:17.161
Let's go again.

15:17.195 --> 15:19.129
No. We're done.

15:19.164 --> 15:20.598
I'm sorry, but if I can't beat you,

15:20.632 --> 15:21.765
how am I gonna beat her army?

15:21.765 --> 15:23.042
Wow. You really like to give up.

15:23.386 --> 15:24.707
I know you think you know more,

15:24.707 --> 15:26.474
but I have my share of experience, too.

15:26.474 --> 15:28.226
I know about battles that can't be won.

15:28.239 --> 15:30.441
And right now, the
best hope for me...

15:30.475 --> 15:32.577
and, more importantly,
my mother... is survival.

15:32.611 --> 15:34.044
Wow. I was wrong.

15:34.079 --> 15:37.147
You really, really like to give up.

15:37.182 --> 15:39.015
I like to survive.

15:39.050 --> 15:40.717
It isn't living.

15:40.751 --> 15:42.852
It's actually the definition of living.

15:42.887 --> 15:44.788
Now who's naive?

15:44.822 --> 15:46.890
I went through this with my sister.

15:46.924 --> 15:49.025
Scary things happened, and
she did what you're doing.

15:49.060 --> 15:50.026
She hid.

15:51.128 --> 15:52.495
But the way she hid was by running away.

15:52.529 --> 15:54.631
She thought that was the
solution to her problem,

15:54.665 --> 15:56.232
but it wasn't.

15:56.266 --> 15:58.167
She needed a push, like you,

15:58.202 --> 16:00.436
to see that surviving isn't living.

16:00.471 --> 16:02.072
And you gave her that push?

16:02.106 --> 16:04.908
I almost died doing it, but, yeah, I did.

16:04.942 --> 16:08.340
And if you become Bo Peep's slave,

16:08.340 --> 16:10.246
you'll be doing the same thing.

16:12.149 --> 16:13.682
I'll lose everything if we fight.

16:13.717 --> 16:15.151
You'll lose more if you don't.

16:15.185 --> 16:17.186
Let me be the judge of
what loss I can take.

16:17.221 --> 16:18.254
Stop being so stubborn.

16:18.288 --> 16:19.803
You don't know anything about loss.

16:19.803 --> 16:20.823
You're just afraid of it.

16:20.857 --> 16:21.729
Oh, I don't, do I?

16:21.833 --> 16:23.391
If you did, you wouldn't act this way.

16:23.426 --> 16:25.628
Loss is exactly why I'm acting this way.

16:25.662 --> 16:26.862
I think it's cowardice.

16:28.865 --> 16:32.300
I mean...

16:32.335 --> 16:35.904
Well, yeah, I mean that.

16:38.441 --> 16:40.875
When I was 6 years old, one morning,

16:40.909 --> 16:45.347
I woke up hearing my
father and mother go at it.

16:45.381 --> 16:47.949
They fought a lot...

16:47.983 --> 16:53.021
Usually over the same
thing... his drinking.

16:53.055 --> 16:57.025
But this time, something was different,

16:57.059 --> 17:00.528
and I heard my father not yelling,

17:00.562 --> 17:03.531
but crying...

17:03.565 --> 17:06.567
And through the tears, he said to my mother

17:06.601 --> 17:10.404
words I would never forget...

17:10.438 --> 17:12.040
"I will beat this."

17:12.074 --> 17:17.310
He said to her, "I have
to be better for the boy."

17:17.345 --> 17:19.846
"I have to be different."

17:19.881 --> 17:24.017
"I have to stop."

17:24.051 --> 17:25.553
And he promised he would.

17:27.121 --> 17:31.391
Every few months, we needed supplies.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.459
It was a two-week journey...

17:33.494 --> 17:36.697
usually one that was a two-week bender.

17:39.464 --> 17:41.201
But he said he was leaving this time,

17:41.235 --> 17:42.402
and he wouldn't touch a drop,

17:42.436 --> 17:46.539
and in two weeks, he would be back home,

17:46.574 --> 17:49.209
himself again...

17:49.243 --> 17:53.446
her husband, my father.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.480
We'd be a family.

17:56.483 --> 17:59.852
My mother kept this
secret from me, but I knew.

17:59.886 --> 18:02.521
And every morning for two weeks,

18:02.555 --> 18:04.056
I woke with a smile on my face

18:04.091 --> 18:08.027
knowing my father would be back.

18:08.061 --> 18:10.329
So...

18:10.363 --> 18:13.477
On the 14th day, I arose,

18:13.477 --> 18:15.000
and I heard a knock at the door,

18:15.035 --> 18:20.505
and I ran to open it,
ready to hug my father...

18:20.540 --> 18:22.608
And I was greeted by the local constable.

18:25.578 --> 18:30.682
Yeah, my father fought his battle...

18:30.717 --> 18:34.853
And for 13 days, he won.

18:34.887 --> 18:41.860
But on the 14th, he spent
his last night in a tavern...

18:41.894 --> 18:46.564
And they found his body
in the wreckage of our cart

18:46.598 --> 18:49.067
at the bottom of a ravine.

18:52.504 --> 18:55.105
Some battles can't be won.

18:55.140 --> 18:56.574
Some forces are too strong.

18:56.608 --> 18:58.976
You had a lousy father.

18:59.010 --> 19:00.444
I mean he was weak.

19:00.479 --> 19:03.247
I-I mean you are not.
I-I mean you're strong.

19:03.282 --> 19:04.282
You don't know that.

19:04.316 --> 19:07.851
I hope it.

19:07.886 --> 19:10.921
Look... I just need a night here

19:10.955 --> 19:13.290
before I continue my journey,

19:13.324 --> 19:16.426
but I'll stay tomorrow and
help, if that's what you want.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.162
Just meet me in the morning at the barn,

19:18.196 --> 19:22.132
and we can continue training.

19:22.167 --> 19:25.402
But if you don't...

19:25.436 --> 19:27.604
Then I'll just be on my way.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.719
Wow.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.389
I got to give it to you
you put on quite a show.

19:47.424 --> 19:49.558
You want to tell me what this is about?

19:49.592 --> 19:50.559
No.

19:50.593 --> 19:51.928
Just that I'm very powerful,

19:51.962 --> 19:54.218
and you and your people...
you need to be more careful.

19:54.218 --> 19:55.264
Keep your distance.

19:55.299 --> 19:56.532
I think I can guarantee that,

19:56.566 --> 20:01.337
so if you want to, you know,
hit "undo" on that, then...

20:01.371 --> 20:02.471
We'll get right on it.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.940
I...

20:04.974 --> 20:06.241
Not right away.

20:07.310 --> 20:08.477
Bring me what I want,

20:08.511 --> 20:10.479
and then I'll consider freeing you.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.166
Your sister, right?

20:12.749 --> 20:14.531
I can't really look for her from in here.

20:15.226 --> 20:16.213
Emma!

20:16.213 --> 20:17.452
Can you hear me?

20:17.486 --> 20:19.354
- What is that?
- Uh...

20:19.388 --> 20:20.424
- It's a...
- Emma, are you okay?

20:20.424 --> 20:21.522
Say something.

20:21.557 --> 20:23.925
Allows me to talk to my father,

20:23.960 --> 20:26.661
who's on the other side of that wall,

20:26.695 --> 20:30.265
but if you want to melt
that, we can all talk.

20:30.299 --> 20:31.632
Tell him to go get Anna.

20:36.071 --> 20:38.539
Dad, can you hear me?

20:39.941 --> 20:40.908
Emma.

20:40.942 --> 20:44.011
Say again.

20:44.045 --> 20:45.946
I'm in here with this woman.

20:45.981 --> 20:47.814
She's looking for her sister, Anna.

20:47.849 --> 20:49.783
She thinks that Anna is in town

20:49.817 --> 20:52.786
because she found a necklace
of hers in gold's shop.

20:52.820 --> 20:54.721
She wants us to try
to find her before...

20:54.756 --> 20:56.757
before I freeze this
town and everyone in it.

21:03.331 --> 21:06.264
- Is she fixing it?
- I've got a fridge full of iffy clams.

21:06.357 --> 21:08.569
- Just read the manual.
- The manual's in Japanese.

21:08.583 --> 21:09.807
Well, just do something.

21:09.939 --> 21:11.940
Maybe Marco should be
helping with the power.

21:11.975 --> 21:13.041
He's the handyman.

21:13.075 --> 21:14.409
Geppetto? You think?

21:14.443 --> 21:16.678
I mean, I'm not sure
handcrafted tuscan wood carvings

21:16.713 --> 21:18.079
are really gonna save the day.

21:18.114 --> 21:18.981
Dr. Whale?

21:19.015 --> 21:20.081
He's a doctor, not electrician.

21:20.116 --> 21:21.916
- We don't need help!
- You think?

21:21.950 --> 21:24.252
I mean, I'm grumpy now. Imagine me
in the morning without a coffee maker.

21:24.286 --> 21:29.524
Or a computer or stop
lights, TV, DVD, CD, DVR, DVD.

21:29.558 --> 21:31.959
Stop saying letters!

21:31.994 --> 21:33.961
Look, I am not magic.

21:33.996 --> 21:36.731
I have had eight hours
of sleep in the last week,

21:36.765 --> 21:39.000
I am breastfeeding, and I am exhausted!

21:39.034 --> 21:40.768
I don't need this.

21:40.802 --> 21:42.369
I may have cast a little curse,

21:42.404 --> 21:45.139
but I did not ask to maintain
a metropolitan electrical grid.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.875
Oh, and get this... I'm starting
to get why Regina was evil.

21:47.910 --> 21:49.276
It wasn't her! It was you!

21:49.310 --> 21:52.613
You have survived your entire
lives without light bulbs!

21:52.648 --> 21:55.082
Buy a flashlight!

22:09.464 --> 22:11.665
Aren't you cold? I'm freezing.

22:11.699 --> 22:13.433
It's never bothered me.

22:15.269 --> 22:16.970
The other day, there
was something here...

22:17.004 --> 22:18.204
we called it a snow monster.

22:18.238 --> 22:19.505
I assume that's something you made?

22:19.540 --> 22:22.175
I'll do whatever it takes
to get my sister back.

22:22.209 --> 22:26.046
I can tell you care about her a lot.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.713
I'm sorry about her necklace.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.084
Where is it?

22:31.118 --> 22:32.285
It fell into the ice here.

22:36.056 --> 22:38.650
You can melt down to get it back.

22:39.226 --> 22:41.260
Keep going, and we could
take this whole conversation

22:41.295 --> 22:42.462
somewhere warmer.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.671
You can't control it, can you?

22:52.706 --> 22:54.902
What you said to David on the walkie...

22:54.902 --> 22:56.206
it wasn't a threat. It was a warning,

22:56.206 --> 22:57.442
because you can't
control what you're doing.

22:57.477 --> 23:00.045
What makes you think you know me?

23:00.080 --> 23:02.080
Because I know me, and I have powers, too,

23:02.115 --> 23:03.982
and I am not great at controlling them.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.917
And it looks to me like
you're the same way.

23:05.951 --> 23:08.286
You...

23:08.321 --> 23:09.488
You have magic?

23:09.522 --> 23:11.456
Yeah.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.828
Anna helps.

23:16.862 --> 23:19.764
She... Helps me control it.

23:19.798 --> 23:23.267
So if I can find her,
she can help me undo this.

23:23.301 --> 23:26.437
We can get rid of all
this... the whole wall...

23:26.471 --> 23:27.672
when she's here.

23:27.706 --> 23:30.608
Well, I'm afraid she's not.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.777
Maybe your magic could
help get us out of here.

23:32.811 --> 23:33.977
I've been trying...

23:34.012 --> 23:35.412
even just trying to warm myself up.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.914
I can't really feel my hands or my feet.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.484
Okay.

23:50.528 --> 23:54.497
See? I-I don't have
control o-over mine, either.

23:54.532 --> 23:56.833
Oh, God. I'm just tired.

23:56.868 --> 23:59.988
- Oh, no.
- If I could just... lay down for a minute.

23:59.988 --> 24:01.038
Emma. Emma, talk to me.

24:01.072 --> 24:03.073
Tell me more.

24:03.107 --> 24:06.143
Uh, were you born with magic or cursed?

24:06.177 --> 24:08.044
So, those are my two options?

24:08.078 --> 24:09.179
Um, I don't know.

24:09.213 --> 24:12.782
I-I was raised in a
place without mag-ic,

24:12.816 --> 24:14.184
and, um...

24:14.218 --> 24:16.386
I didn't know I had these
powers until recently,

24:16.420 --> 24:18.954
and I didn't have any parents
around to help me with them.

24:18.989 --> 24:21.724
Parents don't always help.

24:21.758 --> 24:25.561
I ended up queen
of a large land, unprepared.

24:25.595 --> 24:27.129
I hear you with "unprepared."

24:27.164 --> 24:30.833
I'm... get this...

24:30.867 --> 24:33.368
a savior.

24:33.403 --> 24:35.204
I'm still not sure what
the hell that means.

24:35.238 --> 24:39.241
Sometimes, it all feels
like too much, doesn't it?

24:39.275 --> 24:42.344
And even trying to
just shut it out...

24:42.378 --> 24:44.346
that ends up hurting people, too.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.781
And part of it is

24:46.816 --> 24:48.983
I'm the only one I've ever heard of

24:49.018 --> 24:50.352
with powers like mine.

24:50.386 --> 24:52.588
That has to be very lonely.

24:53.723 --> 24:55.990
I'm very sorry I trapped us here.

24:56.025 --> 24:57.025
I didn't mean it.

24:57.059 --> 24:58.559
I know.

24:58.594 --> 25:00.561
Emma?

25:00.596 --> 25:02.463
Emma?

25:05.434 --> 25:07.168
It appears our honeymoon is over.

25:07.203 --> 25:08.770
Yeah, there's an emergency.

25:08.804 --> 25:10.038
Emma's trapped under ice

25:10.072 --> 25:12.140
by a woman with some kind of ice magic.

25:12.174 --> 25:13.307
And this involves me because?

25:13.342 --> 25:15.576
You're the bloody dark one. Do something.

25:15.611 --> 25:17.311
Well, I could melt the ice
and destroy it with a thought,

25:17.346 --> 25:19.280
but that would also
destroy your girlfriend.

25:19.314 --> 25:20.414
Is that what you want?

25:20.449 --> 25:21.849
No one's destroying anyone.

25:21.883 --> 25:24.526
Now, the woman who has Emma
trapped is in there with her,

25:24.526 --> 25:27.020
and she's looking for
her sister... name of Anna.

25:27.055 --> 25:28.256
She thinks she's in town

25:28.290 --> 25:30.117
because of something of hers
she found in your shop...

25:30.500 --> 25:31.225
a necklace.

25:31.446 --> 25:32.392
Is that it?

25:32.426 --> 25:33.761
Wait.

25:35.563 --> 25:36.730
I know this.

25:42.656 --> 25:45.558
I know exactly who Anna is.

25:45.886 --> 25:47.312
Joan?

25:47.993 --> 25:50.461
Joan, I'm sorry, but we can't win this.

25:50.495 --> 25:52.163
You have to go before Bo Peep returns.

25:52.197 --> 25:54.866
I-I brought some provisions.

25:54.900 --> 25:57.425
Get out of here. You can save yourself.

25:57.425 --> 25:58.896
No, she can't.

26:02.747 --> 26:03.880
Where's Joan?

26:03.971 --> 26:06.106
I have her where she can't get out...

26:07.642 --> 26:10.844
and get herself in trouble.

26:10.878 --> 26:15.982
And even if she does, she's been branded.

26:16.016 --> 26:17.484
I can find her...

26:17.518 --> 26:20.519
Always and forever.

26:20.554 --> 26:22.088
So, now all that's left

26:22.123 --> 26:24.724
is for you and your mommy to pay me...

26:24.759 --> 26:26.793
Or hand over your farm.

26:29.930 --> 26:32.531
Emma, don't sleep.

26:32.566 --> 26:34.167
Right. Right. I'm here.

26:34.201 --> 26:36.535
Tell me more about your son.

26:36.570 --> 26:38.237
Oh, you only want to know more

26:38.272 --> 26:41.140
because you know if I sleep, I'll die.

26:41.174 --> 26:42.141
Emma.

26:42.175 --> 26:44.410
Emma, stay with me.

27:00.093 --> 27:01.726
Sorry, lambkins. We're closed.

27:01.761 --> 27:04.062
I need your help.

27:04.097 --> 27:06.899
You and me... we ain't friends.

27:06.933 --> 27:08.267
I'm not interested. Get out.

27:09.568 --> 27:12.870
You don't have your helpers
here with you anymore, peep.

27:13.939 --> 27:17.575
Right. I just have one.

27:17.610 --> 27:18.976
Say hello.

27:19.011 --> 27:20.178
Don't do it.

27:23.148 --> 27:24.616
Now, my daughter's in trouble,

27:24.650 --> 27:26.851
and I need to find the
person that can help her...

27:26.885 --> 27:27.852
someone you branded.

27:27.886 --> 27:30.421
I branded a lot of people.

27:30.455 --> 27:32.790
Her name was Anna. She
went by "Joan" back then.

27:32.825 --> 27:35.059
Do I look like I keep a record book?

27:35.093 --> 27:36.794
'Cause I don't.

27:36.829 --> 27:37.862
Then you know what I need.

27:39.464 --> 27:40.497
Hook, back room.

27:40.532 --> 27:42.279
She won't keep it far from her.

27:42.279 --> 27:43.701
You're looking for a Shepherd's crook.

27:43.735 --> 27:45.536
Hey. Hey!

27:45.570 --> 27:46.937
That's my personal property.

27:46.971 --> 27:48.372
- Give it up!
- Sorry.

27:53.010 --> 27:55.111
Ah, so, in this world, you're a hero?

27:57.048 --> 27:59.916
In this world, I don't
have to answer to you.

27:59.951 --> 28:02.585
Let's go find Anna. Hook?

28:02.619 --> 28:05.155
Hook?

28:06.224 --> 28:07.824
It's that woman, Elsa.

28:07.859 --> 28:09.125
She said Emma's passed out.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.582
She's freezing to death.

28:23.383 --> 28:24.605
High noon.

28:25.726 --> 28:26.891
Right on time.

28:28.193 --> 28:29.894
I hope you got my money.

28:29.928 --> 28:31.429
Sorry.

28:31.463 --> 28:36.801
You're not actually considering fighting.

28:36.835 --> 28:39.203
You know you can't win.

28:41.172 --> 28:42.407
Boys.

29:07.064 --> 29:09.866
Guess mama's got to
get her hands dirty now.

29:16.473 --> 29:19.742
See? Told you you can't win.

29:19.776 --> 29:21.144
Actually...

29:24.381 --> 29:26.382
maybe I can.

29:33.056 --> 29:35.691
Where is Joan?

29:35.725 --> 29:37.493
I don't owe you any answers.

29:39.663 --> 29:41.564
Then I'll find her myself.

29:41.598 --> 29:45.067
You're gonna help me
whether you'd like to or not.

29:47.971 --> 29:49.871
Okay.

30:21.336 --> 30:23.137
Oops.

30:23.171 --> 30:25.772
I thought you were them.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.345
Got your necklace back.

30:31.380 --> 30:33.014
You did it.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.349
You fought, and... you won.

30:35.384 --> 30:38.386
Well, don't be so surprised.
It was your idea.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.202
Yeah, I just didn't
think we had the time.

30:41.155 --> 30:44.391
I mean, I hoped we did,
and I had faith in you.

30:44.425 --> 30:47.895
Okay. You were right.

30:47.929 --> 30:51.565
It was an impossible battle...

30:51.599 --> 30:53.266
Which is why I had to fight it.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.069
What changed your mind?

30:57.638 --> 31:00.606
It didn't get more impossible.

31:02.276 --> 31:04.911
When she took you.

31:06.147 --> 31:08.948
You barely know me. I was starting to.

31:08.982 --> 31:12.351
And what you said
about your sister, uh...

31:12.385 --> 31:17.056
I might be able to survive, but...

31:17.090 --> 31:20.259
I also have to be able to
live with myself, and I...

31:20.293 --> 31:24.329
I can't do that if I'm
trapped in a life I don't want.

31:26.433 --> 31:29.701
Now, I think it's time
we get you on your way.

31:31.271 --> 31:32.271
Thank you.

31:46.285 --> 31:47.652
Elsa?

31:47.687 --> 31:50.354
Elsa? How's Emma?

31:52.558 --> 31:56.027
She's freezing... turning blue.

31:56.062 --> 31:57.729
No. Emma!

31:59.732 --> 32:01.699
It's not gonna help.

32:01.733 --> 32:02.933
Elsa...

32:02.968 --> 32:04.135
Listen to me.

32:04.169 --> 32:05.570
I need you to find a way out.

32:05.604 --> 32:07.238
I need Anna.

32:07.272 --> 32:09.372
Well, we don't have her right now,

32:09.372 --> 32:11.493
but we have a way to find her, and we will,

32:11.691 --> 32:13.444
but right now, you're gonna
have to do this on your own.

32:13.479 --> 32:15.613
I can't control this.

32:15.647 --> 32:17.348
I know how you feel.

32:17.382 --> 32:19.717
Y-you're trapped.

32:19.751 --> 32:21.719
It's a battle you can't win,

32:21.753 --> 32:23.954
but it's exactly the kind
of battle you have to fight,

32:23.989 --> 32:24.989
or you'll die.

32:25.023 --> 32:27.124
No, I won't. I'll survive.

32:27.158 --> 32:29.159
But Emma...

32:29.193 --> 32:32.295
survival isn't enough. You have to live.

32:32.330 --> 32:34.131
Where did you hear that?

32:34.165 --> 32:35.365
You know where.

32:35.399 --> 32:38.635
Anna? You knew her?

32:38.669 --> 32:40.203
Yeah, I did.

32:40.238 --> 32:41.971
She helped me once,

32:42.006 --> 32:44.541
a long time ago, become who I am.

32:44.575 --> 32:46.309
She saved my life and yours,

32:46.344 --> 32:50.013
and now I need you to save Emma's.

32:50.047 --> 32:53.149
I didn't know much about Anna, but...

32:53.183 --> 32:55.818
She wouldn't want you
to live alone in an ice cave,

32:55.853 --> 32:58.487
which is where you'll be
if you don't melt that ice.

33:00.658 --> 33:02.025
Now do it!

33:43.699 --> 33:45.567
It's working.

33:52.641 --> 33:55.610
I can see her. Emma!

33:59.181 --> 34:00.447
Emma!

34:03.151 --> 34:04.151
Let's get her home,

34:04.186 --> 34:06.987
warmed up.

34:07.022 --> 34:09.056
Are you okay?

34:18.833 --> 34:20.833
You did it.

34:20.868 --> 34:22.202
You saved her.

34:22.237 --> 34:25.972
Yes, I did.

34:26.005 --> 34:27.940
But I also endangered her.

34:27.975 --> 34:29.342
You owe me nothing.

34:29.377 --> 34:32.712
I owe your sister everything,
and what I said was true.

34:32.746 --> 34:35.614
She helped me, and now
I'm gonna help you.

34:35.649 --> 34:37.350
This isn't over.

34:37.384 --> 34:38.618
We're gonna find Anna.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.735
Still can't read Japanese,

34:49.771 --> 34:51.804
but I can do this.

34:56.643 --> 34:59.980
It should start!

35:03.618 --> 35:06.419
I know, honey. I know
you're hungry. I'm sorry.

35:06.454 --> 35:10.423
I will feed you in just a second.

35:14.761 --> 35:17.297
Hungry.

35:17.331 --> 35:19.031
It's hungry, too.

35:19.066 --> 35:20.400
Fuel.

35:25.205 --> 35:27.272
Fuel!

35:38.551 --> 35:40.652
That's right.

35:40.686 --> 35:42.721
It's feeding time.

35:46.259 --> 35:48.494
Oh!

35:48.528 --> 35:49.861
Aah!

35:49.895 --> 35:53.198
Yes!

35:54.234 --> 35:56.601
Baby high five!

35:56.636 --> 35:59.104
Who wants some milk from mama mayor?

36:03.776 --> 36:05.209
- Emma...
- Hmm.

36:05.244 --> 36:06.444
You okay?

36:07.513 --> 36:08.780
She's so cold.

36:10.149 --> 36:11.782
Ah.

36:18.823 --> 36:21.359
Oh, that's good.

36:21.393 --> 36:22.726
I'll go make some hot cocoa.

36:22.761 --> 36:24.928
- Wait.
- I know. With cinnamon.

36:26.165 --> 36:28.532
I'm sorry if I wasn't
much help earlier, kid.

36:31.502 --> 36:32.936
I'm just glad you're okay.

36:32.971 --> 36:34.371
I was already down to one mother,

36:34.405 --> 36:36.106
and I won't go lower than that.

36:38.609 --> 36:41.311
Elsa...

36:41.345 --> 36:42.680
You okay?

36:44.582 --> 36:48.985
Not only have I lost my sister,
I've lost her necklace, too.

36:49.019 --> 36:50.787
Now I have nothing of hers.

36:52.956 --> 36:54.624
Then let's find her.

36:57.761 --> 36:59.962
I hope I'll see both of you at the wedding.

36:59.997 --> 37:01.630
Consider this an early present

37:01.665 --> 37:03.666
in case you get hungry on your journey.

37:03.701 --> 37:06.368
I love sandwiches.

37:06.403 --> 37:08.137
You've changed him, you know?

37:08.172 --> 37:10.239
David? Nah.

37:10.273 --> 37:13.576
He was always this way.
He just didn't know it.

37:13.610 --> 37:15.377
Thank you.

37:15.412 --> 37:17.279
I'm glad I helped.

37:17.314 --> 37:19.781
Can I ask you about the magic?

37:19.816 --> 37:22.251
Like, with Bo Peep's staff...

37:22.285 --> 37:23.719
is that usual around here?

37:23.753 --> 37:26.689
Well, there's always a bit
of magic around these parts.

37:26.723 --> 37:29.658
Uh, my parents... they
had a problem with magic.

37:29.693 --> 37:31.059
Really powerful stuff.

37:31.094 --> 37:33.662
Would there be someone who could help them

37:33.697 --> 37:35.430
with that kind of a thing?

37:35.464 --> 37:37.465
I'm no expert,

37:37.499 --> 37:39.835
but there is one man...

37:39.869 --> 37:42.938
a very powerful wizard who's
well-versed in all magics.

37:42.972 --> 37:46.441
Perhaps he can help me. What's his name?

37:46.475 --> 37:50.311
I don't like to say such a name out loud.

37:50.346 --> 37:53.681
He's... a bit dangerous.

37:53.716 --> 37:55.216
But I'll write it down for you.

37:55.251 --> 37:57.385
Thank you.

38:00.689 --> 38:02.690
What's this?

38:02.725 --> 38:04.659
He's yours... to help you on your way.

38:06.729 --> 38:09.663
I thought he was something
you could never give up.

38:09.697 --> 38:12.767
Uh, he's a reminder...

38:12.801 --> 38:16.370
one I don't need or want anymore.

38:16.404 --> 38:17.838
He was my father's.

38:34.121 --> 38:37.658
Look at you... all heroic now.

38:37.692 --> 38:40.193
Eh, still just a Shepherd.

38:41.862 --> 38:42.862
We'll see.

38:59.646 --> 39:04.183
"Rumple... Rumplestiltskin."

39:12.326 --> 39:14.326
Mm. Hmm!

39:15.661 --> 39:16.995
I don't see anything.

39:17.030 --> 39:18.663
It should work.

39:18.698 --> 39:20.032
Is it broken?

39:21.434 --> 39:23.501
Or does it mean something happened to her?

39:24.871 --> 39:26.738
Wait. What's that sound?

39:34.913 --> 39:36.448
Is that a heartbeat?

39:36.482 --> 39:37.749
It is.

39:37.783 --> 39:41.619
We might not know where your sister is...

39:41.654 --> 39:43.455
But we know the most important thing.

39:43.489 --> 39:45.724
She's alive.

39:47.192 --> 39:49.593
- Who's alive?
- Oh.

39:50.695 --> 39:51.729
Who are you?

39:51.763 --> 39:53.998
Uh, this is Elsa.

39:54.032 --> 39:56.067
We're gonna find her sister.

39:57.202 --> 39:59.337
That's what this family
does. We find people.

39:59.371 --> 40:01.805
We always do,

40:01.840 --> 40:04.475
because we really...

40:04.509 --> 40:06.377
Really don't like to give up.

40:25.629 --> 40:27.230
I know you're in there!

40:28.565 --> 40:32.235
You can give up on yourself,

40:32.270 --> 40:34.637
but I'm not gonna give up on you!

40:34.671 --> 40:37.740
And I'm not gonna go away
just because you told me to!

40:37.775 --> 40:40.610
I belong here, and I'm
gonna come back every day,

40:40.644 --> 40:42.978
because this is my house, too!

40:46.450 --> 40:48.518
And I miss my room!

40:52.422 --> 40:55.624
Henry.

40:57.493 --> 40:58.527
Mom.

41:13.275 --> 41:15.744
You did this.

41:15.778 --> 41:17.479
You might not totally control it,

41:17.513 --> 41:20.982
but this is amazing and... Unique,

41:21.016 --> 41:23.280
and you said you're the
only one who has this power.

41:24.001 --> 41:26.148
That's probably a good
thing for everyone.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.993
And you. I mean, this is kind of...

41:28.357 --> 41:29.523
Cool.

41:30.492 --> 41:32.160
Pun intended.

41:33.662 --> 41:36.864
Well, regardless, there's no
need for a barrier anymore.

41:36.898 --> 41:39.100
Let me take it down.

41:50.779 --> 41:52.947
Why can't I bring it down?

41:52.981 --> 41:56.684
There's no reason this thing
should be staying frozen.

41:56.718 --> 41:58.318
I'm the only one with this power.

41:58.353 --> 42:01.421
I should be able to undo it.

42:01.456 --> 42:04.891
So, what's keeping this thing up?

42:08.929 --> 42:11.064
Thanks.

42:11.099 --> 42:13.133
Power outage must be
your worst nightmare.

42:13.167 --> 42:14.968
Lose a lot of merchandise?

42:15.002 --> 42:18.270
No. I didn't lose anything.

42:18.305 --> 42:20.406
Just lucky, I guess.
