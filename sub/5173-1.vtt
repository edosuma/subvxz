00:37.078 --> 00:41.331
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to my underground lair.

00:41.499 --> 00:46.503
I have gathered here before me
the world's deadliest assassins.

00:46.671 --> 00:52.217
And yet each of you
has failed to kill Austin PoWers.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.927
That makes me angry.

00:54.095 --> 00:58.640
And when Dr. Evil gets angry,
Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.602
And when Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset...

01:02.312 --> 01:04.230
...people die!

01:10.571 --> 01:13.990
Why must I be surrounded
by fricking idiots?

01:21.290 --> 01:24.250
Mustafa, Frau Farbissina.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.087
I spared your lives
because I need you to help me...

01:27.254 --> 01:29.839
...rid the world
of Britain's top secret agent.

01:30.007 --> 01:36.471
The only man who can stop me now.
We must kill Austin Powers.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.022
- Yeah.
Oh! It's Austin.

02:14.427 --> 02:15.553
Oh, it's Austin.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.514
Come on, babies.
Work with me, people. All right.

02:18.682 --> 02:20.474
Show me love.

02:22.894 --> 02:24.395
Great, baby, yeah.

02:25.689 --> 02:28.232
Oh, behave.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.985
It's Austin Powers!

02:38.243 --> 02:39.994
Yeah.

02:51.257 --> 02:56.636
- It's Austin PoWers!
- Aah! Oh, my God!

03:47.147 --> 03:50.650
- Hllo, Mrs. Kensington.
- Hello, Austin.

03:50.817 --> 03:53.778
Why don't you ever model for me,
Mrs. Kensington?

03:53.946 --> 03:57.281
You know how Mr. Kensington
feels about that.

03:57.449 --> 03:59.325
Oh, behave.

03:59.693 --> 04:04.330
Yeah. Yeah, baby, yeah.

04:10.462 --> 04:14.590
Hello, Austin. I'm Basil Exposition,
With British Intelligence.

04:14.758 --> 04:19.637
We have just received word that Dr. Evil
is planning a trap for you tonight...

04:19.805 --> 04:22.848
...at the Electric Psychedelic
Pussycat Swinger's Club...

04:23.016 --> 04:24.517
...here in swinging London.

04:24.685 --> 04:26.310
We'll be there.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.787
Yeah, come on, baby.

04:43.955 --> 04:48.166
There you go.
Come on swingers, yeah. Yeah.

04:54.132 --> 04:56.550
Austin, it's a swinging shindig.

04:56.718 --> 04:59.928
It's my happening, baby,
and it freaks me out.

05:00.096 --> 05:03.181
Yeah, man!

05:21.367 --> 05:23.410
- Can I get you a drink, Mr. Powers?
- Sure.

05:23.578 --> 05:26.413
Austin, we've got to look for Dr. Evil.

05:26.581 --> 05:30.460
Wait, I've got an idea.

05:31.253 --> 05:34.088
Austin, why on Earth
did you hit that woman?

05:34.256 --> 05:36.549
Right. Let me show you, baby.

05:36.717 --> 05:40.762
That ain't no woman. It's a man, man.

05:42.723 --> 05:44.515
It's one of Dr. Evil's assassins.

05:45.726 --> 05:47.435
Look out, he's got a knife!

05:53.442 --> 05:56.944
Good Work, Mrs. Kensington.
All right, get up. Get up!

05:57.112 --> 06:00.281
Right. Where's Dr. Evil, huh?
Where is he?

06:03.577 --> 06:05.286
There's the bastard.

06:07.289 --> 06:09.916
Come on, let's go.
Excuse me, coming through.

06:10.084 --> 06:11.626
Excuse me.

06:14.254 --> 06:18.132
- I've got you now, Dr. Evil.
Not this time.

06:18.300 --> 06:23.972
Come, Mr. Bigglesworth.
See you in the future, Mr. Powers.

06:27.936 --> 06:31.605
My God, he's freezing himself.

06:43.284 --> 06:45.285
Oh, my God, look!

06:57.715 --> 07:02.261
And so Dr. Evil escaped
and had himself cryogenically frozen...

07:02.429 --> 07:05.097
...to return at a time
when free love no longer reigned...

07:05.265 --> 07:07.307
...and greed and corruption ruled again.

07:24.034 --> 07:25.076
Yes?

07:25.244 --> 07:26.953
- Commander Gilmour?
- Speaking.

07:27.121 --> 07:29.289
Commander, this is Ritter
in SoWest Com Three.

07:29.457 --> 07:33.126
We have a potential bogey with erratic
vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.

07:33.294 --> 07:36.379
What are you saying, son?

07:36.547 --> 07:38.798
Well, it appears to be
in the shape of a Big Boy.

07:38.966 --> 07:42.051
Good God, he's back.

07:42.219 --> 07:44.429
Well, in many ways,
the Big Boy never leff, sir.

07:44.597 --> 07:47.849
He's always offered the same high-quality
meals at competitive prices.

07:48.017 --> 07:51.895
- Shut up.
- Shall I scramble TacHO for an intercept?

07:52.062 --> 07:56.858
- What's its current position?
- Well, I'm presently tracking it over Nevada.

07:57.026 --> 07:58.818
Oh, my God. The Big Boy's gone.

07:58.986 --> 08:03.406
Listen, son, I want you to forget
what you saW here today.

08:04.742 --> 08:06.117
Philips.

08:06.285 --> 08:07.702
- Call the President.
- Yes, sir.

08:07.870 --> 08:11.457
Prepare the jet. Bring my overnight bag.

08:11.625 --> 08:17.755
And, uh, Philips, feed my fish.
Not too much.

08:17.923 --> 08:20.257
I'm off to London, England.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.556
Powers volunteered
to have himself frozen...

08:27.724 --> 08:29.767
...in case Dr. Evil should ever return.

08:29.935 --> 08:32.520
Well, I hope your boy's up to it.

08:32.687 --> 08:38.317
We don't Wanna have to bail
you guys out again, like after WWII.

08:39.528 --> 08:41.403
This is our celebrity vault.

08:52.916 --> 08:56.752
- Please.
Who is this Austin Powers?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.921
The ultimate gentlemen spy.

08:59.089 --> 09:02.049
Irresistible to women,
deadly to his enemies.

09:02.217 --> 09:05.595
A legend in his own time.

09:05.763 --> 09:09.641
Attention: Stage One.
Laser cutting beginning.

09:11.811 --> 09:13.562
Laser cutting complete.

09:24.949 --> 09:30.370
Stage Two:
Warm liquid goo phase beginning.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.001
Warm liquid goo phase complete.

09:36.168 --> 09:41.131
Stage Three: Reanimation beginning.

09:42.341 --> 09:44.759
Reanimation complete.

09:47.680 --> 09:52.517
Stage Four: Cleansing beginning.

09:56.731 --> 09:59.275
Cleansing complete.

10:21.298 --> 10:25.926
Stage Five: Evacuation beginning.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.750
Evacuation com...

11:06.594 --> 11:07.761
Evacuation com...

11:09.597 --> 11:12.224
Com... Com...

11:13.976 --> 11:15.268
Evacuation com...

11:17.605 --> 11:22.150
I don't want Smarties,
I want a Mars bar, Mommy.

11:24.529 --> 11:27.781
Wh...? Where am I?

11:27.949 --> 11:32.202
You're in the Ministry of Defense.
It's 1997.

11:32.370 --> 11:34.955
You've been cryogenically frozen
for 30 years.

11:35.748 --> 11:37.207
Who are these people?!

11:37.375 --> 11:40.794
The shouting is a temporary side effect
of the unfreezing process.

11:40.962 --> 11:45.466
Yes, I'm having difficulty controlling
the volume of my voice!

11:46.135 --> 11:48.803
This is Commander Gilmour,
U.S. Strategic Command...

11:48.971 --> 11:52.140
...and General Borschevsky,
Russian Intelligence.

11:52.307 --> 11:54.809
Russian Intelligence, are you mad?

11:54.977 --> 11:59.147
A lot's happened since you were frozen.
The Cold War's over.

11:59.314 --> 12:03.651
Well, finally those capitalist pigs
will pay for their crimes, eh?

12:03.819 --> 12:07.780
- Hey, Comrades? Hey?
- Austin, we won.

12:07.948 --> 12:11.284
Oh, groovy. Smashing. Yea, capitalism.

12:11.452 --> 12:13.953
Hello. Hello.

12:14.121 --> 12:16.456
Mr. Powers!
The President's quite concerned.

12:16.623 --> 12:18.666
We've got a madman
on the loose in Nevada.

12:19.126 --> 12:22.795
Dr. Evil. When do I begin?

12:22.963 --> 12:26.007
Immediately.
You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.

12:26.675 --> 12:28.259
Mrs. Kensington.

12:28.427 --> 12:32.555
Austin,
Mrs. Kensington has long since retired.

12:32.723 --> 12:36.476
Ms. Kensington is her daughter.

12:36.643 --> 12:38.896
Ah, here she is.

12:40.899 --> 12:44.860
Vanessa is one of our top agents.

12:50.366 --> 12:56.121
My God, Vanessa's got a fabulous body.
I'll bet she shags like a minx.

12:57.874 --> 13:00.626
How do I tell them
that because of the unfreezing process...

13:00.794 --> 13:03.295
...I have no inner monologue?

13:04.422 --> 13:08.467
I hope I didn't say that
out loud just noW.

13:12.722 --> 13:16.725
Mr. Powers, my job is to
acclimatize you to the '90s.

13:16.893 --> 13:19.186
You know, a lot's changed since 1967.

13:19.979 --> 13:23.065
No doubt, love, but as long as people
are still having promiscuous sex...

13:23.233 --> 13:25.651
...with many anonymous partners
without protection...

13:25.819 --> 13:29.279
...while at the same time
experimenting With mind-expanding drugs...

13:29.447 --> 13:34.661
...in a consequence-free environment,
I'll be sound as a pound.

13:38.332 --> 13:43.837
- Danger Powers' personal effects.
- Actually, my name is Austin Powers.

13:44.004 --> 13:48.591
- It says here, "Name: Danger Powers."
- No, no, no.

13:48.759 --> 13:51.427
Danger's my middle name.

13:52.096 --> 13:54.764
Okay, Austin Danger Powers:

13:55.432 --> 13:58.893
- One blue crushed-velvet suit.
- Hey, all right.

13:59.061 --> 14:02.063
- One frilly lace cravat.
- There it is.

14:02.231 --> 14:05.024
One silver medallion with male symbol.

14:05.776 --> 14:09.112
- One pair of Italian boots.
- Buongiorno, boys.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.866
One vinyl record album:
Burt Bacharach Plays His Hits.

14:13.033 --> 14:19.706
Hey, Burt. How are you?
- One Swedish-made penis-enlarger pump.

14:21.458 --> 14:22.625
That's not mine.

14:22.793 --> 14:27.381
One credit card receipt
for Swedish-made penis-enlarger...

14:27.549 --> 14:29.091
...signed by Austin Powers.

14:29.259 --> 14:32.136
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.

14:32.304 --> 14:36.140
One warranty card
for Swedish-made penis-enlarger pump...

14:36.308 --> 14:38.267
...filled out by Austin PoWers.

14:38.727 --> 14:41.979
I don't even know what this is.
This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.

14:42.147 --> 14:44.982
One book: Swedish-Made
Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me:

14:45.150 --> 14:51.989
This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby,
by Austin Powers.

14:53.617 --> 14:56.577
- Just sign the form.
- Okay, don't get heavy, man. I'll sign.

14:56.745 --> 14:59.997
You know, just to get things moving,
you know.

15:00.165 --> 15:01.415
You all right, baby?

15:02.334 --> 15:05.628
Listen, Mr. Powers,
I look forWard to Working With you...

15:05.795 --> 15:08.839
...but do me a favor
and stop calling me baby.

15:09.007 --> 15:13.969
- You can address me as Agent Kensington.
- Oh, come on.

15:14.846 --> 15:18.516
- All right, then. Vanessa.
- Was that so hard?

15:20.061 --> 15:22.187
Now, come along.
We have to leave immediately.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.773
We've preserved your private jet
just as you left it.

15:24.941 --> 15:29.527
- It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
- My jumbo jet? Smashing, baby.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.322
Ooh, sorry.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.449
Mr. Powers.

15:37.370 --> 15:41.539
Quickly.
Quickly, come on, noW. Let's go.

15:55.763 --> 15:58.723
Gentiemen,
welcome to my underground lair.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.893
It's been 30 years, but I'm back.

16:02.061 --> 16:06.356
Everything's gone perfectly to plan
except for one small flaw.

16:06.524 --> 16:10.068
Due to a technical error
by my henchman, Mustafa...

16:10.236 --> 16:13.739
...complications arose
in the unfreezing process.

16:13.907 --> 16:17.660
- My design Was perfect.
- Look what you did to Mr. Bigglesworth!

16:20.455 --> 16:25.167
But, Dr. Evil, we were unable
to anticipate feline complications...

16:25.335 --> 16:27.044
...due to the reanimation process.

16:27.212 --> 16:28.379
Silence!

16:36.763 --> 16:38.472
Let this be a reminder to you all...

16:38.640 --> 16:41.642
...that this organization
will not tolerate failure.

16:47.733 --> 16:50.568
Gentlemen, let's get down to business.

16:55.282 --> 16:58.284
- We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me.

16:58.452 --> 17:02.455
I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.

17:04.416 --> 17:07.961
Some of you I know.
Some of you I'm meeting for the first time.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.923
Aah. Hello up there. Anyone?

17:12.090 --> 17:15.886
Could someone call an ambulance?
I'm in quite a lot of pain.

17:16.054 --> 17:18.472
Okay, you've all been gathered here
to form my evil cabinet...

17:18.239 --> 17:20.807
Excuse me.

17:20.974 --> 17:22.851
- Yes, he's down there.
Is he dead yet?

17:23.019 --> 17:26.313
No, not dead. No, burnt, badly.

17:26.481 --> 17:28.565
Should I take care of him,
possibly with a gun?

17:28.733 --> 17:30.192
- Yes.
- Kill him?

17:30.610 --> 17:31.651
Right.

17:31.819 --> 17:34.321
If somebody could open
the retrieval hatch down here...

17:34.489 --> 17:37.449
...I could get out.
See, I designed this device myself.

17:38.993 --> 17:41.745
Oh, hi. Good. I'm glad you found me.

17:41.913 --> 17:44.998
Listen, I'm very badly burned,
so if you could just...

17:46.918 --> 17:49.711
You shot me!
- Okay, moving on.

17:49.879 --> 17:52.589
You shot me right in the arm! Why did...?

18:04.770 --> 18:08.606
Right. Let me go around the table
and introduce everyone.

18:08.774 --> 18:13.778
Frau Farbissina, founder of the militant wing
of the Salvation Army.

18:13.946 --> 18:19.659
Random Task, Korean ex-wrestler,
evil handyman extraordinaire.

18:19.827 --> 18:24.038
Random Task, show them what you do.

18:37.719 --> 18:41.097
Patty O'Brien, ex-Irish assassin.

18:41.265 --> 18:45.059
His trademark, a superstitious man,
he leaves a tiny keepsake...

18:45.227 --> 18:48.354
...from his good-luck bracelet
on every victim he kills.

18:48.522 --> 18:52.901
Scotland Yard Would love to get their hands
on that piece of evidence.

18:53.069 --> 18:56.405
Yeah, they're alWays after
me lucky charms.

19:01.786 --> 19:04.705
What? Why does everyone always laugh
when I say that?

19:05.290 --> 19:07.583
They are after me lucky charms.

19:08.251 --> 19:09.543
What?

19:09.711 --> 19:15.132
It's a television commercial,
with this cartoon leprechaun.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.593
And all of these children
are trying to chase him.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.263
"Hey, leprechaun man, leprechaun man.
We want to get your lucky charms."

19:21.431 --> 19:25.434
Ha, ha. Oh, and there's all of these
little tiny bits of marshmalloWs...

19:25.602 --> 19:29.229
...just stuck right in the cereal,
so that When the kids eat them, they think:

19:29.397 --> 19:31.523
"Oh, this is candy. I'm having fun."

19:34.777 --> 19:39.364
Finally we come to my number-two man.
His name?

19:39.782 --> 19:40.949
Number TWo.

19:41.117 --> 19:47.999
For 30 years, Number Two has run Virtucon,
the legitimate face of my evil empire.

19:49.043 --> 19:54.797
Dr. Evil, over the last 30 years,
Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds.

19:55.799 --> 19:59.636
About 15 years ago,
we changed from volatile chemicals...

19:59.803 --> 20:02.472
...to the communications industry.

20:02.973 --> 20:05.934
We own cable companies in 38 states.

20:06.101 --> 20:11.814
We own a steel mill in Cleveland,
shipping in Texas' oil refineries in Seattle...

20:11.982 --> 20:16.402
...and a factory in Chicago
that makes miniature models of factories.

20:16.570 --> 20:18.655
Naturally, yes.

20:18.822 --> 20:20.490
Gentlemen.

20:22.243 --> 20:24.285
I have a plan.

20:33.837 --> 20:35.463
It's called blackmail.

20:35.881 --> 20:41.011
As you know, the royal family of Britain
are the wealthiest landowners in the world.

20:41.179 --> 20:45.307
Either the royal family pays us
an exorbitant amount of money...

20:45.475 --> 20:50.020
...or we make it seem that Prince Charles
has had an affair outside of marriage...

20:50.188 --> 20:55.067
...and therefore, would have to divorce.

20:57.153 --> 21:01.865
Prince Charles did have an affair,
he admitted it, and they are noW divorced.

21:02.534 --> 21:04.451
Right. Okay, you have
to tell me these things.

21:04.619 --> 21:09.373
All right?
I've been frozen for 30 years, okay?

21:09.541 --> 21:15.879
Throw me a fricking bone here.
I'm the boss. Need the info.

21:16.047 --> 21:19.300
Okay, no problem.
Here's my second plan.

21:19.467 --> 21:22.511
Back in the '60s,
I developed a weather-changing machine...

21:22.679 --> 21:25.180
...which was, in essence,
a sophisticated heat beam...

21:25.348 --> 21:26.974
...which we called a "laser."

21:27.142 --> 21:32.355
Using these "lasers," we punch a hole
in the protective layer around the world...

21:32.523 --> 21:35.692
...which we call the "ozone layer."

21:35.860 --> 21:39.404
Slowly, but surely, ultraviolet rays
would pour in...

21:39.572 --> 21:45.493
...increasing the risk of skin cancer,
that is, unless...

21:45.661 --> 21:50.248
...the world pays us a hefty ransom?

21:54.920 --> 21:58.089
That also already has happened.

21:58.591 --> 22:00.008
Shit.

22:01.552 --> 22:03.428
Oh, hell,
let's just do what We alWays do:

22:03.596 --> 22:07.432
Hijack some nuclear weapons
and hold the world hostage, yeah? Good.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.434
Gentlemen, it's come to my attention...

22:09.602 --> 22:13.104
...that a breakaway Russian republic,
Kreplachistan, is about to transfer...

22:13.272 --> 22:18.109
...a nuclear warhead to the United Nations
in a few days. Here's the plan.

22:18.277 --> 22:22.906
We get the warhead
and we hold the world ransom for...

22:23.657 --> 22:26.702
...$1 million.

22:29.414 --> 22:34.210
Well, don't you think We should, maybe,
ask for more than a million dollars?

22:34.378 --> 22:38.130
A million dollars
isn't exactly a lot of money these days.

22:38.298 --> 22:41.842
Virtucon alone
makes over $9 billion a year.

22:42.010 --> 22:45.388
Really? That's a lot of money.

22:45.555 --> 22:50.267
Okay, then.
We hold the World ransom for...

22:51.019 --> 22:56.023
...$100 billion.

22:59.361 --> 23:01.821
Pretty groovy jumbo jet, eh?

23:01.988 --> 23:06.325
When you see this jet a-rocking
don't come a-knocking, baby, yeah.

23:06.493 --> 23:08.619
I'm gonna need you to sign
these release forms.

23:08.787 --> 23:10.663
- Release forms?
- You're not officially...

23:10.831 --> 23:14.375
...working for the Ministry of Defense.
These forms indemnify the Ministry...

23:14.543 --> 23:17.838
...against any, um, mishaps
that may occur in the line of duty.

23:18.005 --> 23:22.676
Mishaps? But isn't that what being
an international man of mystery is all about?

23:24.011 --> 23:28.515
Okay, name: Austin Danger Powers.

23:28.683 --> 23:31.017
Sex: Yes, please.

23:33.479 --> 23:36.690
How does a hot chick like you
end up working at the Ministry of Defense?

23:36.858 --> 23:41.820
Oh, well, I went to Oxford
where I excelled in several subjects...

23:41.988 --> 23:44.364
...but I ended up specializing
in foreign languages.

23:44.532 --> 23:47.993
You know, I really wanted to travel.
You know, sort of see the World.

23:48.161 --> 23:51.204
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen,
why don't We go in the back and shag?

23:51.372 --> 23:53.748
- What?
- I've been frozen for 30 years.

23:53.916 --> 23:56.460
I've gotta see
if my bits and pieces are still working.

23:56.627 --> 23:59.379
- Excuse me?
- My Wedding tackle.

23:59.547 --> 24:01.173
- I'm sorry.
- My meat and two veg.

24:01.340 --> 24:02.841
My twig and berries.

24:03.009 --> 24:06.052
- Hello, lads, are you still awake?
- Mr. Powers, Mr. PoWers, please.

24:06.721 --> 24:09.514
I'd appreciate it
if you could concentrate on our mission...

24:09.682 --> 24:12.059
...and give your libido a rest.

24:13.228 --> 24:15.146
Can I, uh...?

24:15.689 --> 24:18.399
Can I show you something?

24:31.997 --> 24:35.666
I won't bite, hard.

24:40.297 --> 24:42.381
All right.

24:43.467 --> 24:46.844
Let me ask you a question,
and be honest.

24:48.889 --> 24:54.894
Do I make you horny? Randy?
Do I make you horny, baby? Yeah, do I?

24:55.062 --> 24:58.231
God, I hope this is part
of the unfreezing process.

24:58.398 --> 25:00.775
Oh, turbulence. Oh, look at that.

25:00.943 --> 25:02.944
Oh, turbulence. Oh, I fell over.

25:03.111 --> 25:05.864
- Oh, I fell over again.
- Get off me.

25:06.032 --> 25:07.950
Mr. Powers!

25:08.326 --> 25:12.120
I will never have sex With you, ever.
If you were the last man on Earth...

25:12.288 --> 25:15.624
...and I was the last Woman on Earth,
and the future of the human race...

25:15.792 --> 25:18.335
...depended on our having sex
simply for procreation...

25:18.503 --> 25:20.754
...I still would not have sex With you.

25:21.631 --> 25:23.632
What's your point, Vanessa?

25:40.108 --> 25:41.567
Yeah.

25:41.901 --> 25:44.403
Remember when We froze your semen?

25:44.571 --> 25:47.114
You said if it didn't look
like you were coming back...

25:47.282 --> 25:49.074
...we should try to make you a son...

25:49.242 --> 25:51.743
...so that a part of you could live forever?
- Oh, sure.

25:51.911 --> 25:57.165
Well, after a couple of years,
we got a little impatient.

25:57.334 --> 26:01.504
Dr. Evil, I Want you to meet your son.

26:01.672 --> 26:02.839
My son?

26:04.592 --> 26:05.842
Scott!

26:14.602 --> 26:17.812
Hello, Scott.
- Hi.

26:18.147 --> 26:23.192
I'm your father, Dr. Evil.

26:25.195 --> 26:26.863
I haven't seen you my whole life.

26:27.031 --> 26:30.950
And noW you come back
and just expect a relationship?

26:31.118 --> 26:33.328
Pfft. I hate you.

26:36.498 --> 26:37.707
What?

26:37.875 --> 26:41.836
- Can I have a hug?
No.

26:42.630 --> 26:43.880
- Give me a hug.
No way.

26:44.048 --> 26:45.173
- Come here.
I'm not.

26:45.341 --> 26:46.466
- Let's go.
Forget it.

26:46.634 --> 26:48.343
Pronto.
- What are you doing?

26:48.510 --> 26:51.847
I'm with it. I'm hip.

27:05.570 --> 27:09.573
Well, don't look at me like I'm fricking
Frankenstein. Give your father a hug.

27:09.741 --> 27:13.494
- You're... Hey. Don't touch me.
- Come on. Hug. Hug.

27:13.662 --> 27:16.872
- Get away from me, you lazy-eyed psycho.
- Hug.

27:33.264 --> 27:36.225
Viva Las Vegas, baby! Yeah!

27:46.195 --> 27:50.281
- Yeah.
Welcome to Las Vegas, sir.

27:53.160 --> 27:58.790
- So which side of the bed do you Want?
- You're sleeping on the sofa, Mr. Powers.

27:58.958 --> 28:01.126
In fact, I'd like to take this opportunity...

28:01.293 --> 28:03.712
...to remind you
the only reason We're sharing a room...

28:03.879 --> 28:06.965
...is to keep up the context
that we're a married couple on vacation.

28:07.133 --> 28:11.302
Right. Shall we shag now
or shall we shag later?

28:11.470 --> 28:14.139
How do you like to do it?
Do you like to wash up first?

28:14.306 --> 28:18.643
You know, top and tails? Whore's bath.
Personally, before I'm on the job...

28:18.811 --> 28:22.605
...I like to give my undercarriage
a bit of a hoW's your father.

28:23.858 --> 28:25.108
I'm just joking, Vanessa.

28:25.276 --> 28:29.404
I'm just trying to get a rise out of you,
that's all. For shits and giggles.

28:30.030 --> 28:32.073
Let's unpack.

28:38.039 --> 28:40.916
Gor blimey. Nerd alert.

28:55.515 --> 28:56.807
How did this get in here?

28:57.350 --> 29:02.146
Somebody's playing a prank on me.
Honestly, it's not mine.

29:02.314 --> 29:05.858
Hey, Americans. Yeah. Enjoy that wine.

29:06.026 --> 29:07.401
Hey, there you are.

29:07.569 --> 29:10.362
- Do I know you?
- No. But that's Where you are, you're there.

29:10.530 --> 29:13.866
Hey, viva Las Vegas, baby.
Hey, how are you?

29:14.034 --> 29:15.409
- Okay, Austin?
- Yes.

29:15.577 --> 29:18.287
Austin. There's a company in Las Vegas
called Virtucon...

29:18.455 --> 29:21.081
...which we think
may be linked to Dr. Evil.

29:21.249 --> 29:24.627
Plenty of the Virtucon executives
are gambling in this casino.

29:25.086 --> 29:28.380
Smashing. Let's go.
Look. There's one over there.

29:28.882 --> 29:30.007
Changing a thousand.

29:30.175 --> 29:32.552
Hello. Excuse me.

29:36.224 --> 29:39.893
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

29:41.521 --> 29:43.021
Game is blackjack, gentlemen.

29:43.481 --> 29:45.649
Ten thousand dollars minimum bet.

29:46.234 --> 29:49.069
King for you, sir. And a three for you.

29:51.197 --> 29:53.156
Seventeen.

30:00.289 --> 30:03.667
- Hit me.
- You have 17, sir.

30:04.418 --> 30:06.920
I like to live dangerously.

30:10.007 --> 30:12.008
Four. Twenty-one.

30:12.176 --> 30:15.595
Nice. Nice.
Nice.

30:15.763 --> 30:17.055
Well-played.

30:18.724 --> 30:20.267
Five.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.522
I'll stay.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.358
I suggest you hit, sir.

30:29.778 --> 30:35.783
- I also like to live dangerously.
As you Wish, sir.

30:37.953 --> 30:41.789
Twenty beats your five. I'm sorry, sir.

30:41.957 --> 30:46.919
Well, I won't lie to you.
Cards are not my bag, baby.

30:47.296 --> 30:53.092
Allow myself to introduce... myself.

30:53.510 --> 30:58.764
My name is Richie Cunningham.
And this is my wife, Oprah.

31:00.601 --> 31:02.810
My name is Number Two.

31:02.978 --> 31:09.150
This is my Italian confidential secretary.
Her name is Alotta. Alotta Fagina.

31:10.611 --> 31:13.613
- Come again?
- Alotta Fagina.

31:13.780 --> 31:18.327
I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it. It sounded
like you said your name was a lot of...

31:19.662 --> 31:21.538
Never mind.

31:23.541 --> 31:27.502
- What exactly do you do, Mr. Number Two?
- That's my business.

31:29.005 --> 31:32.507
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the little boys' room.

31:33.509 --> 31:35.552
You keep your eye on the Italian bird.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.263
- We'll rendezvous back at the hotel suite.
- Okay.

31:38.598 --> 31:40.641
Anything else?
No.

31:55.031 --> 31:59.034
You didn't happen to see anything at all?

32:00.495 --> 32:02.204
Sorry.

32:15.386 --> 32:17.053
Howdy.

32:23.477 --> 32:25.728
That is one crazy getup
you got there, fella.

32:25.896 --> 32:27.146
Oh, thank you.

32:27.314 --> 32:31.025
- Are you in the show?
- Uh, no, actually. I'm English.

32:31.193 --> 32:35.571
- Ooh. I'm sorry.
- Right.

32:45.082 --> 32:50.086
- Hey, partner. Have a good one.
- Ah. Okay.

33:12.777 --> 33:14.987
Hey, partner. Come on,
you gotta relax. Don't force it.

33:15.155 --> 33:17.614
Gonna blow out your O-ring, drop a lung.

33:30.920 --> 33:40.137
Who does Number Two work for?

33:40.305 --> 33:42.639
That's right, buddy.
You show that turd who's boss.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.229
Hey. Hey, just grab a hold of something,
bite your lip and give it hell.

33:49.397 --> 33:52.441
Come on, we're gonna get through this.

33:56.738 --> 34:00.158
Hey, that sounds pretty nasty.
How about a courtesy flush over there?

34:09.126 --> 34:13.505
Jesus Christ, boy. What did you eat?

34:24.016 --> 34:27.768
Gentlemen, the warhead is ours.

34:28.312 --> 34:32.607
Patch me through to the United Nations
Security Secret Meeting Room.

34:34.025 --> 34:37.195
Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.

34:37.362 --> 34:42.033
In a little while, you'll notice that the
Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing.

34:42.201 --> 34:47.246
If you want it back,
you're going to have to pay me...

34:47.414 --> 34:49.958
...$1 million.

34:56.882 --> 34:58.050
Sorry.

34:59.386 --> 35:02.429
One hundred billion dollars.

35:02.597 --> 35:05.307
Gentlemen, silence.

35:05.475 --> 35:09.186
- Now, Mr. Evil...
- Dr. Evil.

35:09.354 --> 35:11.605
I didn't spend
six years in evil medical school...

35:11.773 --> 35:14.191
...to be called mister,
thank you very much.

35:14.359 --> 35:19.530
It is the policy of the United Nations
not to negotiate with terrorists.

35:19.698 --> 35:24.368
Really? So long.

35:30.584 --> 35:33.294
Gentlemen, in exactly five days...

35:33.461 --> 35:37.506
...we will be $100 billion richer.

36:13.836 --> 36:15.337
Hello? Mummy?

36:15.504 --> 36:20.675
- Oh, hello, Vanessa. And how's Austin?
- He's asleep.

36:20.843 --> 36:24.930
- You didn't.
- No. I made him sleep on the sofa.

36:25.097 --> 36:29.726
- Vanessa, I'm proud of you.
- Why?

36:29.894 --> 36:34.231
Because you've managed to resist
Austin Powers' charms.

36:34.398 --> 36:36.816
Ha, ha. God knows he tried, Mummy.

36:36.984 --> 36:39.278
I actually had to end up being
rather firm with him.

36:39.446 --> 36:42.240
What about his teeth? It's really bizarre.

36:42.407 --> 36:47.161
Darling, you have to understand,
in Britain in the '60s...

36:47.329 --> 36:51.415
...you could be a sex symbol
and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

36:51.583 --> 36:52.875
Did you ever...?

36:53.043 --> 36:57.505
Me? No, of course not.
I was married to your father.

36:57.673 --> 37:04.470
- Did you ever Want to?
- Austin is very charming, very debonair.

37:04.638 --> 37:08.933
He's handsome, witty,
has a knowledge of fine wines.

37:09.601 --> 37:12.687
Women want him
and men want to be him.

37:12.854 --> 37:16.440
Every bit
an international man of mystery.

37:16.608 --> 37:18.859
Yeah, you didn't answer my question,
Mummy.

37:19.027 --> 37:20.778
I know.

37:21.446 --> 37:23.531
Let me just say this.

37:23.699 --> 37:29.161
Austin was the most loyal
and caring friend I ever had.

37:29.329 --> 37:31.623
I will always love him.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.838
- Do you Wanna speak to him?
- No, it's been too long.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.882
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to go, Mummy.
But I love you.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.092
Ciao, darling.

37:48.141 --> 37:52.853
A limo's just pulled up.
- Let me see.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.064
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

37:56.232 --> 38:00.652
HoW can you tell?
- I never forget a pussy... cat.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.574
Oh, no. He's gone away.

38:07.910 --> 38:11.872
My God, Vanessa.
You are so incredibly beautiful.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.708
- Oh.
- That's it.

38:14.876 --> 38:18.086
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Come on, darling.

38:18.254 --> 38:21.340
I'm gonna take you out
for a night on the town.

38:32.061 --> 38:34.771
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Bacharach.

39:38.253 --> 39:39.878
Oh, yeah.
Get on with it.

39:40.046 --> 39:43.465
I'm gonna do it. Do you want me?
Unh! Oh, go on.

39:43.633 --> 39:46.176
- Do you Want me to do it? Okay.
- Yes, go on.

39:47.512 --> 39:51.473
Right hand, green. Oh, no!

39:53.343 --> 39:55.936
You all right? You all right?

39:56.104 --> 40:00.357
Oh, you know what?
Wait a tick, I forgot something in the lobby.

40:01.192 --> 40:04.236
Why don't I take the stairs?

40:07.532 --> 40:11.661
Why take the stairs
when I could take the escalator?

40:17.001 --> 40:20.545
Why take the escalator
when I've got a perfectly good canoe?

40:23.632 --> 40:26.968
I know What. I'll take the elevator.

40:30.890 --> 40:33.516
- Austin.
- Yes.

40:34.059 --> 40:37.520
- Come and have some champagne With me.
- Okay.

40:37.897 --> 40:39.981
Oh, I tripped.

40:40.149 --> 40:42.734
You know, I haven't had this much fun
since college.

40:42.902 --> 40:44.652
Well, I'm sorry.

40:44.820 --> 40:48.573
- Why?
- I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

40:52.161 --> 40:55.371
Always wanting to have fun, Austin.
That's you in a nutshell.

40:55.539 --> 40:56.873
No, this is me in a nutshell.

40:57.041 --> 41:00.627
Help. I'm in a nutshell.
How did I get into this nutshell?

41:00.794 --> 41:03.087
Look at the size of this
bloody, great, big nutshell.

41:03.255 --> 41:08.010
What sort of shell has a nut like this?
I mean, this is crazy.

41:08.178 --> 41:11.096
Yes. Look at you.

41:11.264 --> 41:12.765
- You're smashed.
- No, I'm not.

41:12.933 --> 41:15.184
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not. I'm the sensible one.

41:15.352 --> 41:18.103
I'm always the designated driver.

41:21.441 --> 41:22.900
- Kiss me.
- I can't, darling.

41:23.068 --> 41:25.277
- Why not?
- Because you're drunk. It's not right.

41:25.445 --> 41:27.112
No, I'm not drunk. I'm beginning to see...

41:27.280 --> 41:29.907
...what my mummy was talking about
all those years ago.

41:30.075 --> 41:31.116
I can't.

41:33.578 --> 41:35.955
All right, well, tell me
all about my mummy in the '60s.

41:36.122 --> 41:38.457
I'm dying to know what she was like.

41:39.334 --> 41:42.086
She was very groovy.

41:44.464 --> 41:47.007
Your dad loved her very much.

41:49.427 --> 41:52.304
If there Was one other cat in this world
that could've loved her...

41:52.472 --> 41:57.059
...and treated her as well as your dad,
well, it was me.

41:58.271 --> 42:02.774
But unfortunately for yours truly...

42:05.444 --> 42:07.862
...that train has sailed.

42:11.617 --> 42:15.829
Vanessa? Vanessa? Hello?

42:16.539 --> 42:20.208
Come on. Roll over. Sleepy time.

42:24.463 --> 42:26.631
Okay, Austin needs his hand back.

42:34.890 --> 42:36.891
You've got mail.

42:37.059 --> 42:41.354
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition
from British Intelligence.

42:41.522 --> 42:45.025
Now, I want you to find out
what part Virtucon plays...

42:45.192 --> 42:48.028
...in something called Project Vulcan.

42:48.195 --> 42:52.199
I'll need you to go
to Alotta Fagina's penthouse immediately.

43:19.603 --> 43:21.562
Hello, hello.

43:23.732 --> 43:27.693
Smashing. Love it. Okay. Yes, yes.
Okay, great.

43:31.823 --> 43:37.411
Project Vulcan.
Yeah, okay. Cheeky, huh? Yeah.

43:37.579 --> 43:40.414
Come on, baby. Give it to me.
Yes. Yes. Yes. No! No!

43:49.217 --> 43:52.886
You seem surprised to see me,
Miss Fagina.

43:53.346 --> 43:57.599
What do you want,
Mr. Cunningham' was it?

43:57.767 --> 44:00.435
Your boss, Number Two.

44:01.104 --> 44:05.732
I understand that cat's involved
in big underground drills.

44:06.150 --> 44:07.442
How did you know?

44:08.027 --> 44:11.822
I didn't, baby. You just told me.

44:11.989 --> 44:14.533
We can talk about business later.

44:14.701 --> 44:17.285
Let me slip into
something more comfortable.

44:17.453 --> 44:20.288
Oh, behave.

44:30.425 --> 44:32.134
Good God.

44:50.154 --> 44:51.571
Me?

45:09.214 --> 45:14.135
Come in and I'll show you
everything you need to know.

45:36.993 --> 45:38.994
Come on.

45:45.376 --> 45:50.881
- May I wash you?
- Oh, groovy, baby. Yeah.

46:00.558 --> 46:04.812
Mm, yes. That feels yummy.

46:12.570 --> 46:17.574
In Japan, men come first
and women come second.

46:17.742 --> 46:19.409
Or sometimes not at all.

46:23.373 --> 46:27.377
- Care for some sake?
- Sake it to me, baby.

46:31.340 --> 46:35.885
Yes. Kinky. Clinky.

46:45.104 --> 46:47.438
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

46:47.606 --> 46:52.944
Mm. I feel extreme relaxation.

46:57.366 --> 47:00.159
How dare you break wind before me.

47:00.327 --> 47:02.370
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't know it was your turn.

47:06.959 --> 47:09.460
Pardon me for being rude
It was not me, it was my food

47:09.628 --> 47:14.090
It just popped up to say hello
And now it's gone back down below

47:14.258 --> 47:16.885
That's beautiful. Thank you.

47:18.680 --> 47:24.602
Let's make love,
you silly, hairy little man.

47:24.769 --> 47:26.687
I say. Hello, vicar.

47:30.400 --> 47:33.569
Oh, there. That's the spot, all right.
That's the spot right there.

47:33.737 --> 47:35.613
Look at that now. Ha, ha. Good God.

47:40.911 --> 47:45.456
Austin Powers is getting too close.
Any suggestions?

47:47.542 --> 47:52.671
I have created the ultimate weapon
to defeat Austin Powers.

47:53.882 --> 47:56.300
Bring in the Fembots!

48:10.983 --> 48:13.526
Go, Fembots!

48:15.696 --> 48:19.824
These are the latest word
in android-replicant technology.

48:19.992 --> 48:26.706
Lethal, efficient, brutal.
No man can resist their charm.

48:26.874 --> 48:29.584
Send in the guards!

48:33.047 --> 48:36.299
Kill these women.

48:59.907 --> 49:04.412
Ouite impressive.
- Thank you, Herr Doctor.

49:04.579 --> 49:08.874
I like to see girls of that "caliber."

49:12.963 --> 49:16.924
By caliber, of course I mean
both the size of their gun barrels...

49:17.092 --> 49:23.514
...and the high quality of their characters.
Two meanings, caliber. It's a homonym.

49:26.268 --> 49:28.144
Forget it.

49:31.440 --> 49:33.441
At ease, boys.

49:35.527 --> 49:40.448
Austin, I Want to show you something.
We're going to outfit you With this.

49:40.615 --> 49:45.578
It looks like a watch, but in fact
it's a geosynchronous positioning device.

49:45.746 --> 49:47.705
Very shagadelic.

49:47.873 --> 49:51.292
- And then there's this.
- Okay, let me guess.

49:51.460 --> 49:55.921
The floss is garrote Wire,
the toothpaste is plastic explosives...

49:56.089 --> 49:59.468
...and the toothbrush
is the detonation device.

49:59.635 --> 50:01.219
No, actually.

50:01.387 --> 50:05.766
Since you've been frozen, there have been
fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.

50:06.684 --> 50:08.185
What do you mean?

50:08.352 --> 50:09.770
Nothing.

50:09.937 --> 50:11.646
Oh, look, here's Basil.

50:11.814 --> 50:13.398
- Hello, Exposition.
- Austin.

50:13.941 --> 50:15.776
Let me bring you up to speed.

50:15.943 --> 50:19.946
Dr. Evil has hijacked
a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan.

50:20.114 --> 50:22.157
Only two things scare me...

50:22.325 --> 50:24.326
...and one is nuclear war.

50:24.869 --> 50:26.578
- What's the other?
- Excuse me?

50:26.788 --> 50:29.039
What's the other thing that scares you?

50:29.207 --> 50:31.666
- Carnies.
- What?

50:31.834 --> 50:34.628
Circus folk. Nomads, you know.

50:34.796 --> 50:36.546
They smell like cabbage.

50:36.714 --> 50:38.090
Small hands.

50:38.257 --> 50:41.760
- Oh. Indeed.
- Perhaps these photographs...

50:41.928 --> 50:44.262
...are the last piece of the puzzle.

50:44.430 --> 50:46.848
I've uncovered the details
of Project Vulcan.

50:47.016 --> 50:49.559
Oh, good God, an underground missile?

50:49.769 --> 50:51.687
Austin, where did you find these?

50:51.855 --> 50:55.691
Austin did some reconnaissance work
last night at Alotta Fagina's penthouse.

50:57.277 --> 51:00.822
- Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon.
- What?

51:00.989 --> 51:02.615
Any ideas?

51:03.367 --> 51:04.534
Oh, yes.

51:04.701 --> 51:07.620
Virtucon runs a tour
of its facility every hour.

51:07.788 --> 51:10.248
I thought perhaps we could
disguise ourselves as tourists...

51:10.415 --> 51:13.126
...and do some on-site reconnaissance.

51:13.293 --> 51:15.002
Top-drawer, Kensington.

51:15.170 --> 51:18.714
Oh, uh, Austin, I'd like you
to meet somebody.

51:18.882 --> 51:21.676
This is my mother, Mrs. Exposition.

51:21.844 --> 51:23.344
How do you do?

51:27.057 --> 51:28.641
My God, man, what have you done?

51:28.809 --> 51:31.561
That's not your mother, it's a man, baby!

51:31.728 --> 51:33.813
- Yeah, yeah, come off.
- No!

51:33.981 --> 51:36.399
- Why won't this wig come off?
- My head!

51:36.817 --> 51:38.651
Help!
Austin!

51:38.819 --> 51:42.905
- Yeah, hold on, hold on, one second.
- No, no, let go of my mother!

51:43.073 --> 51:45.409
Oh, mother. Mother, are you all right?

51:45.577 --> 51:47.578
- What?
- Austin, have you gone mad?

51:47.745 --> 51:49.121
No.

51:49.289 --> 51:51.373
You have a lot of explaining to do.

51:51.541 --> 51:54.168
I'm sorry, Basil,
I thought she was a man.

51:54.335 --> 51:56.920
Damn it, man!
You're talking about my mother!

51:57.088 --> 51:59.548
- You have to admit, she is rather mannish.
- Austin.

51:59.716 --> 52:02.092
Well, no offense,
but if that is a woman...

52:02.260 --> 52:05.012
...it does look like she was beaten
with an ugly stick.

52:05.180 --> 52:07.181
What?
- Really, Austin.

52:13.188 --> 52:19.026
Okay, give in to the beauty of your feelings
and say the Words. Come on.

52:20.028 --> 52:22.613
I love you, Dad.

52:22.780 --> 52:25.949
I love you too son.

52:26.117 --> 52:28.577
That's a breakthrough. Breakthrough.

52:30.413 --> 52:33.999
Okay, group, we have some
newcomers here today with us.

52:34.167 --> 52:38.129
Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr...

52:38.297 --> 52:42.258
- "Avil"?
- Evil, actually.

52:44.011 --> 52:46.930
Dr. Evil.

52:47.306 --> 52:50.141
Hello, Dr. Evil. Hello, Scott.

52:50.434 --> 52:52.060
Hello, everybody.

52:52.228 --> 52:54.229
So, Scott, why don't we start with you.

52:54.396 --> 52:56.773
What brings you here With us today?

52:57.816 --> 53:00.485
Well, I just really met my Dad
for the first time five days ago.

53:00.653 --> 53:03.238
I was partially frozen his whole life.

53:03.781 --> 53:07.325
That is beautiful
that you can admit to that.

53:07.576 --> 53:10.912
He comes back and now he Wants me
to take over the family business.

53:11.080 --> 53:14.415
But Scott, who's gonna take over
the world when I die?

53:14.583 --> 53:18.795
Listen to the words he used: "Who's going
to take over the world when I die?"

53:19.505 --> 53:22.757
It feels like that to some of us
sometimes, doesn't it?

53:22.925 --> 53:26.302
So, What do you Want to do, Scott?

53:26.720 --> 53:29.806
I don't knoW.
I was thinking I like animals...

53:29.974 --> 53:32.518
...maybe I'd be a vet.
- An evil vet?

53:32.686 --> 53:35.312
No. Maybe, like, Work in a petting zoo.

53:35.480 --> 53:37.273
An evil petting zoo?

53:37.440 --> 53:40.401
- You alWays do that!
- Wha...? I...

53:42.028 --> 53:45.948
I just think, like, he hates me.
I really think he wants to kill me.

53:46.116 --> 53:49.201
Now, Scott, we don't want to kill
each other in here...

53:49.369 --> 53:52.997
...we might say that we do sometimes,
but we really don't.

53:54.666 --> 53:57.459
Actually, the boy's quite astute.
I really am trying to kill him.

53:57.627 --> 53:59.712
But so far unsuccessfully.

53:59.879 --> 54:02.881
He's quite wily, like his old man.

54:04.968 --> 54:06.969
This is what I'm talking about.

54:07.137 --> 54:08.721
Okay, well...

54:08.888 --> 54:10.514
...we've heard from you, Scott...

54:10.682 --> 54:13.684
...now, uh, you tell us
a little about yourself.

54:13.852 --> 54:17.354
The details of my life
are quite inconsequential.

54:17.522 --> 54:20.566
Oh, no, please, please.
Let's hear about your childhood.

54:20.734 --> 54:22.151
Yeah.
Come on. Come on.

54:22.819 --> 54:24.612
- Come on. Come on.
Please.

54:25.531 --> 54:28.700
Very well, where do I begin?

54:29.160 --> 54:32.579
My father was a relentlessly
self-improving boulangerie owner...

54:32.747 --> 54:37.000
...from Belgium With low-grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery.

54:37.501 --> 54:39.919
My mother was a 15-year-old
French prostitute...

54:40.087 --> 54:42.714
...named Chloe with webbed feet.

54:42.882 --> 54:45.925
My father would womanize,
he would drink...

54:46.093 --> 54:50.263
...he would make outrageous claims,
like he invented the question mark.

54:50.431 --> 54:53.933
Sometimes he would accuse
chestnuts of being lazy.

54:54.435 --> 54:58.355
The sort of general malaise
that only the genius possess...

54:58.522 --> 55:01.107
...and the insane lament.

55:01.275 --> 55:03.526
My childhood was typical.

55:03.694 --> 55:07.113
Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.

55:07.281 --> 55:10.033
In the spring we'd make meat helmets.

55:10.201 --> 55:14.412
When I was insolent, I Was placed
in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds.

55:14.580 --> 55:17.082
Pretty standard, really.

55:17.249 --> 55:20.086
At the age of 12
I received my first scribe.

55:20.253 --> 55:22.922
At the age of 14,
a Zoroastrian named Vilma...

55:23.090 --> 55:26.342
...ritualistically shaved my testicles.

55:26.510 --> 55:29.470
There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum.

55:29.638 --> 55:32.473
It's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.

55:32.641 --> 55:35.142
You know, we have to stop.

55:36.645 --> 55:39.313
Can I have a word with you?
Of course you may, love.

55:42.109 --> 55:44.318
Look, I know I'm being neurotic...

55:44.486 --> 55:48.155
...but I can't shake off this suspicious
feeling about that Italian secretary...

55:48.323 --> 55:49.907
...you know, Ms. Fagina.

55:50.075 --> 55:52.451
I don't want to sound paranoid...

55:52.619 --> 55:55.287
...but I've had some bad relationships
in the past...

55:55.455 --> 55:58.416
...and I have been known to be jealous.
I'm sorry.

55:58.583 --> 56:00.626
No, don't be sorry, baby.

56:01.044 --> 56:03.045
You're right to be suspicious.

56:03.213 --> 56:05.506
- I shagged her.
- What?

56:05.674 --> 56:08.092
I shagged her rotten, baby, yeah.

56:08.844 --> 56:11.805
I don't believe you, Austin.
I mean, she was repellent.

56:12.181 --> 56:14.808
Saucer of milk, table two.
Rwar.

56:14.976 --> 56:17.102
- Well, did you use protection?
- Of course.

56:17.270 --> 56:19.187
I had my 9 mm automatic.

56:19.939 --> 56:22.441
You know I meant
did you use a condom?

56:22.608 --> 56:23.692
No.

56:23.860 --> 56:26.194
Only sailors use condoms, baby.

56:26.362 --> 56:27.821
Not in the '90s, Austin.

56:27.989 --> 56:31.575
Well, they should, those filthy beggars,
they go from port to port.

56:31.742 --> 56:34.035
Well, Vanessa, don't have a thrombo.

56:34.203 --> 56:38.331
- Alotta meant nothing to me.
- Well, it means something to me.

56:38.499 --> 56:40.375
If you want us to have a relationship...

56:40.543 --> 56:43.378
...you have to get it into your head
that times have changed.

56:43.546 --> 56:45.964
You can't just go off
shagging anybody anymore.

56:46.132 --> 56:49.676
And if you could,
I wouldn't because I'm not like that.

56:49.844 --> 56:51.553
Vanessa.

56:53.473 --> 56:55.015
You're everything to me.

56:55.391 --> 56:57.309
You just don't get it, do you?

56:59.562 --> 57:01.188
Good night, Austin.

57:01.355 --> 57:03.398
Welcome to the '90s...

57:03.566 --> 57:05.693
...you're gonna be very lonely.

57:27.424 --> 57:29.258
Hey. Hey, check this guy out.

57:30.385 --> 57:32.929
- Peace.
- Peace. Peace.

57:39.269 --> 57:42.230
Jimi Hendrix, deceased.

57:42.397 --> 57:44.232
Drugs.

57:44.399 --> 57:46.609
Janis Joplin...

57:46.777 --> 57:48.444
...deceased, alcohol.

57:48.737 --> 57:51.447
Mama Cass, deceased...

57:51.615 --> 57:54.492
...ham sandwich.

58:20.144 --> 58:23.021
Oh, jeez, that's great.
Is the lighting halfway decent?

58:23.189 --> 58:26.942
Yes, indeed. They've got the flag
up now.? Ou can see the stars and stripes.

58:27.110 --> 58:28.860
Beautiful, just beautiful.

58:33.783 --> 58:35.492
Good morning, Austin.

58:37.161 --> 58:40.872
You know, I sometimes forget
you've missed out on the last 30 years.

58:41.624 --> 58:43.292
The fall of the Berlin Wall...

58:43.459 --> 58:45.836
...the first female British prime minister...

58:46.004 --> 58:47.421
...end of apartheid.

58:47.589 --> 58:50.800
Yeah, and I can't believe
Liberace was gay.

58:50.968 --> 58:55.138
I mean, Women loved him.
I didn't see that one coming, no.

58:55.931 --> 58:58.975
The tour is about to begin.
So if you please take your seats.

58:59.727 --> 59:02.520
Welcome to Virtucon,
the company of the future.

59:02.855 --> 59:05.356
Virtucon is a leading manufacturer
of many items...

59:05.524 --> 59:07.358
...you can find right in your very own home.

59:07.526 --> 59:09.485
Do you think she's prettier than me?

59:09.653 --> 59:11.904
- Who?
- You know who.

59:12.072 --> 59:13.740
Oh, the Italian bird.

59:13.907 --> 59:16.367
No, baby, she's rancid.

59:16.535 --> 59:20.872
I think you're shagadelic, baby.
You're switched-on. You're smashing.

59:21.040 --> 59:25.209
We make steel, petroleum products
and volatile chemicals.

59:25.377 --> 59:28.546
But don't worry
about the Italian bird, okay?

59:28.714 --> 59:32.050
She's the village bicycle,
everyone's had a ride.

59:32.217 --> 59:33.718
You're using a Virtucon product.

59:33.886 --> 59:38.306
On your right, you'll notice a door
leading to a restricted area.

59:38.474 --> 59:41.809
- Only authorized personnel are alloWed.
I'll take him.

59:42.311 --> 59:44.229
You take her.

59:58.912 --> 01:00:00.412
Let's go.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.082
It's Bolton. We've got a problem.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.627
Intruders in the compound.

01:00:06.795 --> 01:00:08.504
Aah! Watch out!

01:00:09.923 --> 01:00:11.632
Security, this way. Where did he go?

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.509
Judo chop.

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:17.596
They're coming.

01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:19.640
Hang on, I'm gonna floor it.

01:00:19.808 --> 01:00:22.726
Watch out. Move! Move! Move!

01:00:25.063 --> 01:00:26.271
Careful, Austin.

01:00:26.773 --> 01:00:28.524
No!

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:33.779
- Watch out.
No!

01:00:35.448 --> 01:00:38.493
- Watch out.
- No!

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:44.541
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:49.671
Oh, thank goodness we made it, Austin.

01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:53.216
- All right, stay very cool, baby.
- Okay.

01:01:16.949 --> 01:01:18.742
Mr. Powers.

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:21.745
Welcome to my underground lair.

01:01:22.329 --> 01:01:23.913
You're just in time.

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:25.915
Enjoy the show.

01:01:32.215 --> 01:01:36.093
Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.

01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:39.847
The world's most powerful
subterranean drill.

01:01:40.015 --> 01:01:43.350
- Does that make you horny?
- Not now, Austin.

01:01:43.602 --> 01:01:46.353
So powerful it can penetrate
the Earth's crust...

01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:48.856
...delivering a 50 kiloton
nuclear warhead...

01:01:49.024 --> 01:01:51.484
...deep into the liquid hot core
of the planet.

01:01:51.651 --> 01:01:55.279
Upon detonation, every volcano
on Earth...

01:01:55.447 --> 01:01:57.198
...will erupt.

01:01:59.868 --> 01:02:03.579
It seems we have no choice
but to pay your ransom.

01:02:03.747 --> 01:02:05.581
You have my instructions. Bye-bye.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.462
Check it out, Butt-Head,
this chick has three boobs.

01:02:13.548 --> 01:02:14.965
How many butts does she have?

01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:26.311
Do you like your
quasi-futuristic clothes, Mr. PoWers?

01:02:26.479 --> 01:02:28.814
I designed them myself.

01:02:43.913 --> 01:02:47.165
Scott. Scott, my boy, how are you?

01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:48.416
How Was your day?

01:02:48.584 --> 01:02:51.002
Well, my friend Sweet Jay
took me to that video arcade...

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.964
...and they don't speak English,
so Jay got into a fight...

01:02:54.131 --> 01:02:57.259
...and he's all, "Quit hassling me
because I don't speak French."

01:02:57.426 --> 01:03:00.846
And the guy says something in Paris talk
and I'm like, "Just back off."

01:03:01.013 --> 01:03:03.890
And they're all, "Get out."
And we're like, "Make me."

01:03:04.058 --> 01:03:06.184
It was cool.

01:03:06.352 --> 01:03:07.602
Fascinating.

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:09.771
What are your plans for this evening?

01:03:09.939 --> 01:03:12.941
I thought I'd stay in. There's a good
titty movie on Skinemax.

01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:16.278
And that's how you'd like
to live your life, is it?

01:03:16.445 --> 01:03:17.613
Yeah.

01:03:18.907 --> 01:03:21.534
- Pretty much. Yeah, okay.
What?

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:28.958
Scott...

01:03:29.126 --> 01:03:34.255
...I Want you to meet Daddy's nemesis,
Austin Powers.

01:03:34.965 --> 01:03:37.925
What are you feeding him?
Why don't you just kill him?

01:03:38.093 --> 01:03:40.928
No, Scott. I have an even better idea.

01:03:41.096 --> 01:03:43.806
I'm going to place him
in an easily-escapable situation...

01:03:43.974 --> 01:03:47.476
...involving an overly-elaborate
and exotic death.

01:03:48.437 --> 01:03:50.146
Why don't you just shoot him now?

01:03:50.314 --> 01:03:52.899
I mean, I'll go get a gun.
We'll shoot him together. It'll be fun:

01:03:53.066 --> 01:03:54.817
Bang! Dead. Done.

01:03:54.985 --> 01:03:59.780
One more peep out of you and you
are grounded, mister, and I am not joking.

01:04:02.075 --> 01:04:03.492
All right, let's begin.

01:04:04.161 --> 01:04:07.914
Dr. Evil, do you really
expect them to pay?

01:04:08.123 --> 01:04:10.751
No, Mr. Powers...

01:04:10.919 --> 01:04:14.296
...I expect them to die.

01:04:15.006 --> 01:04:16.673
Even after they pay me the money...

01:04:16.841 --> 01:04:21.678
...I'm still gonna melt every city
on the planet with liquid-hot magma.

01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:25.307
Release the sharks.

01:04:25.475 --> 01:04:27.768
Mr. Powers, you'll notice
that all the sharks...

01:04:27.936 --> 01:04:30.020
...have laser beams
attached to their heads.

01:04:30.188 --> 01:04:34.149
I figure every creature
deserves a Warm meal.

01:04:36.027 --> 01:04:37.194
Dr. Evil...

01:04:37.362 --> 01:04:39.363
...it's about the sharks.

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:43.533
When you were frozen, they were
put on the endangered species list.

01:04:43.701 --> 01:04:48.038
We tried to get some, but it would have
taken months to clear up the red tape.

01:04:48.873 --> 01:04:52.167
You know, I have one simple request.

01:04:52.335 --> 01:04:57.297
And that is to have sharks with fricking
laser beams attached to their heads.

01:04:57.465 --> 01:05:02.844
Now, evidently, my cycloptic colleague
informs me that that can't be done.

01:05:03.054 --> 01:05:05.723
Uh, can you remind me
what I pay you people for?

01:05:05.891 --> 01:05:08.142
Honestly, throw me a bone here.

01:05:08.644 --> 01:05:10.019
What do we have?

01:05:10.604 --> 01:05:11.980
Sea bass.

01:05:15.567 --> 01:05:17.568
Right.

01:05:17.736 --> 01:05:20.822
They are mutated sea bass.

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:22.156
Really?

01:05:22.324 --> 01:05:23.908
Are they ill-tempered?

01:05:24.076 --> 01:05:27.036
- Absolutely.
- Well, that's a start. That's something.

01:05:27.204 --> 01:05:31.749
All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily
slow-moving dipping mechanism.

01:05:34.253 --> 01:05:36.087
Close the tank!

01:05:37.089 --> 01:05:40.425
Wait, aren't you even gonna watch them?
They could get away.

01:05:40.592 --> 01:05:42.593
No, no, no,
I'm going to leave them alone...

01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:44.595
...and not actually witness them dying.

01:05:44.763 --> 01:05:47.432
I'm just gonna assume
it all went to plan. What?

01:05:48.475 --> 01:05:51.936
I have a gun in my room.
You give me five seconds, I'll get it...

01:05:52.104 --> 01:05:55.189
...I'll come back down here,
boom, I'll blow their brains out.

01:05:55.774 --> 01:05:57.150
Scott...

01:05:57.736 --> 01:06:00.404
...you just don't get it, do you?

01:06:00.572 --> 01:06:02.072
You don't.

01:06:03.283 --> 01:06:04.992
It's no hassle.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.369
But... I'm...

01:06:07.537 --> 01:06:08.871
All I'm saying...

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:11.081
They're gonna get aw... I...

01:06:11.249 --> 01:06:12.624
I'm... We...

01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:14.418
- We...
- Shh. Knock, knock?

01:06:14.586 --> 01:06:16.253
Who's there?

01:06:17.088 --> 01:06:18.714
- Look...
- Shh! Let me tell you a story...

01:06:18.882 --> 01:06:20.215
...about a man named Shh.

01:06:20.383 --> 01:06:22.968
Shh! Even before you start.

01:06:23.136 --> 01:06:24.970
That was a preemptive "shh."

01:06:25.138 --> 01:06:29.308
Just know I have a whole bag
of "shh" with your name on it.

01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:35.731
What's your plan?

01:06:35.899 --> 01:06:38.650
First, I plan to soil myself.

01:06:38.818 --> 01:06:41.445
Then I'm going to regroup
and come up with a new plan.

01:06:41.613 --> 01:06:43.489
Any thoughts?

01:06:43.656 --> 01:06:45.324
Wait a minute.

01:06:46.367 --> 01:06:48.285
I always have this with me just in case.

01:06:48.453 --> 01:06:51.956
Okay, I get it. I have bad teeth.

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:56.336
No, Austin. The floss is to
swing ourselves onto the ledge.

01:06:57.838 --> 01:06:59.297
All right, hold on.

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:04.344
Got it. Okay. Toothpaste.

01:07:04.637 --> 01:07:06.137
Hello.

01:07:09.308 --> 01:07:10.517
Judo chop!

01:07:12.812 --> 01:07:14.771
Hang on.

01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:25.115
Judo trip.

01:07:27.827 --> 01:07:29.869
No!

01:07:40.881 --> 01:07:43.466
Not a good time to lose one's head.

01:07:43.634 --> 01:07:45.261
Indeed.

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:47.847
That's not the way to get ahead in life.

01:07:48.014 --> 01:07:49.390
No.

01:07:50.475 --> 01:07:53.227
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:57.273
He'll never be the head
of a major corporation.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.775
- Okay, that'll do.
- Okay.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.491
No. What are we gonna do?

01:08:07.659 --> 01:08:11.036
Oh, look, there's an emergency exit.
Go get help, I'm gonna stay here...

01:08:11.204 --> 01:08:12.913
...and keep an eye on Dr. Evil.

01:08:13.081 --> 01:08:15.207
Okay, I'll hurry back.

01:08:16.877 --> 01:08:18.877
Listen, Vanessa.

01:08:20.755 --> 01:08:22.631
Whatever happens...

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:25.676
...I Want you to know
that I feel really bad...

01:08:25.844 --> 01:08:27.928
...about that Italian bird.

01:08:29.264 --> 01:08:31.307
What I'm trying to say is...

01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:34.977
...that if you want me
to be a one-woman man...

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:37.188
...well, that's just groovy, baby.

01:08:38.566 --> 01:08:40.233
Behave.

01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:18.479
Come, everyone...

01:09:18.648 --> 01:09:21.566
...let us repair to the main chamber.

01:09:22.151 --> 01:09:25.362
Project Vulcan is about to begin.

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:31.452
Scott, don't you want to see
what Daddy does for a living?

01:09:31.745 --> 01:09:33.328
- BloW me.
- Excuse me?

01:09:34.497 --> 01:09:36.165
Show me.

01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:38.667
Okay.

01:09:49.513 --> 01:09:52.014
Position the Vulcan.

01:10:05.946 --> 01:10:08.656
Bring in the warhead.

01:10:37.103 --> 01:10:38.395
Hello, hello.

01:10:38.771 --> 01:10:41.231
- Hello, Mr. Powers.
- Hello, Mr. Powers.

01:10:42.608 --> 01:10:45.152
- Care to have a little fun?
- Care to have a little fun?

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.070
No, actually, I, uh...

01:10:47.238 --> 01:10:48.822
I have to save the World.

01:10:59.667 --> 01:11:01.752
Is it cold in here? Heh.

01:11:18.103 --> 01:11:20.438
Arm the probe.

01:11:33.452 --> 01:11:36.454
Yes.

01:11:36.622 --> 01:11:39.874
No! No. No. I've got to get Dr. Evil.

01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:41.793
I've got to get Dr. Evil.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.295
No. No. No. Uh, baseball.

01:11:44.463 --> 01:11:45.797
Uh, cold showers.

01:11:45.964 --> 01:11:47.256
Baseball. Cold showers...

01:11:47.424 --> 01:11:48.758
Give it up, Mr. Powers.

01:11:48.926 --> 01:11:53.930
Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:56.641
Gentlemen.

01:12:00.562 --> 01:12:02.063
Let's lock and load.

01:12:02.231 --> 01:12:04.190
Right, lads.
All right, hup, hup.

01:12:06.568 --> 01:12:08.069
- Don't go.
- Please don't go.

01:12:08.237 --> 01:12:09.695
Stay.
Don't go.

01:12:09.863 --> 01:12:11.407
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.

01:12:11.574 --> 01:12:14.159
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.

01:12:14.577 --> 01:12:16.203
Au contraire, baby.

01:12:16.371 --> 01:12:18.997
I think you can't resist me.

01:12:33.471 --> 01:12:37.349
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:13:44.126 --> 01:13:45.668
Austin?

01:13:45.836 --> 01:13:47.545
Vanessa.

01:13:47.713 --> 01:13:49.839
It... It's not what it seems.

01:13:51.717 --> 01:13:53.885
- At ease, boys.
- Likewise.

01:13:55.596 --> 01:14:00.267
Vanessa, I can explain. See, What happened
was, uh, I broke in trying to get to Dr. Evil.

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:04.188
Then the Fembots came by and smoke
started to come out of their jubblies.

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:07.608
So I thought I'd work my mojo,
right, to counter their mojo.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:11.612
We got "cross-mojonations" and their
heads started to explode. You know...

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.657
...that thing and I ended up
in my knickers here and then...

01:14:16.826 --> 01:14:18.410
Okay, Austin, I believe you.

01:14:18.578 --> 01:14:21.455
- Now, get dressed.
- Smashing, baby.

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:24.583
OnWard, boys.

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:31.465
Launching the subterranean probe.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:39.098
Begin initial surface penetration.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:46.772
Subterranean nuclear detonation
in three minutes and counting.

01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:57.659
Watch out!

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:04.499
Fight back!

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.002
Subterranean nuclear detonation...

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.504
...in three minutes and counting.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.850
I tripped.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.770
Open the fricking door.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:31.234
World destruction, beginning in...

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:35.530
Judo. Judo.
10, nine...

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.658
...eight, seven, six...

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:43.872
...five, four, three...

01:15:44.333 --> 01:15:46.542
...tWo, one...

01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:49.879
No!

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.719
Abort. Abort.

01:15:56.887 --> 01:15:58.804
- Abort. Abort.
Hurray!

01:15:59.848 --> 01:16:02.308
Abort. Abort.

01:16:02.476 --> 01:16:04.977
Now to Dr. Evil.

01:16:05.312 --> 01:16:07.647
Din-din.

01:16:07.814 --> 01:16:10.358
I want chicken
I want liver

01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:14.070
Meow Mix, Meow Mix
Please deliVer

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:17.073
I've got you now, Dr. Evil.

01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:20.409
Well done, Mr. PoWers.

01:16:20.786 --> 01:16:23.996
We're not so different, you and I.

01:16:24.748 --> 01:16:30.503
However, isn't it ironic
that the very things that you stand for...

01:16:30.671 --> 01:16:36.592
...free love, swinging' parties,
are all now in the '90s...

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.221
...considered to be...

01:16:40.431 --> 01:16:41.973
...evil?

01:16:42.141 --> 01:16:44.810
No, man, what We swingers
were rebelling against...

01:16:44.977 --> 01:16:47.104
...is uptight squares like you...

01:16:47.271 --> 01:16:50.065
...whose bag was money
and world domination.

01:16:50.233 --> 01:16:51.942
We were innocent, man.

01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:55.570
If we had known the consequences
of our sexual liberation...

01:16:55.738 --> 01:16:59.616
...we would have done things differently,
but the spirit would've remained the same.

01:16:59.784 --> 01:17:02.703
It's freedom, baby, yeah.

01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:06.123
Face it. Freedom failed.

01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:08.583
No, man, freedom didn't fail.

01:17:08.751 --> 01:17:12.045
Right now, We've got freedom
and responsibility.

01:17:12.213 --> 01:17:14.631
It's a very groovy time.

01:17:14.799 --> 01:17:18.343
There's nothing more pathetic
than an aging hipster.

01:17:18.511 --> 01:17:22.639
All right, baldy, shut your cakehole.
Come on, let's go, on your bike.

01:17:24.016 --> 01:17:25.767
Not so fast.

01:17:25.935 --> 01:17:29.146
It seems the tables have turned,
Mr. Powers.

01:17:29.313 --> 01:17:35.153
- Go ahead, Austin. Don't worry about me.
- Hey, I can take my Sega, right, Dad?

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.656
It seems the tables have turned again,
Dr. Evil.

01:17:38.824 --> 01:17:41.659
Not really. Kill the little bastard,
see what I care.

01:17:41.827 --> 01:17:44.162
But Dad, we just had
a breakthrough in group.

01:17:44.329 --> 01:17:48.249
I had the group liquidated, you little shit.
They were insolent.

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:50.209
I hate you. I hate you.

01:17:50.377 --> 01:17:52.670
I wish I was never
artificially created in a lab.

01:17:52.838 --> 01:17:55.965
Oh, Scott, that hurts Daddy
when you say that, honestly.

01:17:58.385 --> 01:18:01.012
Number TWo, your timing is impeccable.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.139
Go ahead, take Mr. Powers away.

01:18:04.141 --> 01:18:05.808
No.

01:18:06.226 --> 01:18:07.935
- What?
Dr. Evil...

01:18:08.854 --> 01:18:12.815
...I spent 30 years of my life
turning this two-bit evil empire...

01:18:12.983 --> 01:18:15.818
...into a world-class multinational.

01:18:15.986 --> 01:18:18.946
I was going to have
a cover story in Forbes.

01:18:19.114 --> 01:18:22.450
But you, like an idiot,
wanted to take over the world.

01:18:22.618 --> 01:18:25.204
And you don't realize
there is no World anymore.

01:18:25.371 --> 01:18:26.997
It's only corporations.

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:29.583
- Silence, Number Two.
- No.

01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:32.544
I've had enough of you
pushing me around.

01:18:35.757 --> 01:18:40.803
Mr. Powers, I have a business proposition
you might find very interesting.

01:18:41.888 --> 01:18:44.348
All right, I've had enough.

01:18:48.978 --> 01:18:51.063
Judo chop.

01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:55.651
The complex will self-destruct.

01:19:01.324 --> 01:19:02.574
Let's split. Let's go.

01:19:05.245 --> 01:19:07.412
This place is gonna blow.

01:19:13.419 --> 01:19:15.963
The complex will self-destruct.

01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:17.590
Go!

01:19:18.175 --> 01:19:20.093
Come on, let's go.

01:19:22.429 --> 01:19:25.056
The complex will self-destruct.

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.101
This Way, Austin.
Come on, baby...

01:19:28.269 --> 01:19:29.519
...it's gonna bloW, let's go.

01:19:29.687 --> 01:19:32.939
Move it. Alley-oop.

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:06.347
Yeah.

01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:11.061
I love you, Mr. Powers.

01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:15.149
And I love you, Mrs. Powers.

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:19.153
Oh, that'll be Basil Exposition.

01:20:20.238 --> 01:20:24.074
- Oh, ignore it, Austin. Come back to bed.
- Duty calls, baby.

01:20:27.454 --> 01:20:29.079
Hello, Austin.

01:20:29.247 --> 01:20:32.833
Oh, I... I hope I'm not interrupting
your honeymoon.

01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:35.127
No, not at all, Basil.

01:20:35.295 --> 01:20:37.671
Did you get that fruit basket I sent you?

01:20:37.839 --> 01:20:42.134
Yes, we did, Basil, but you sent too much.
I'm gonna have to send some to my mother.

01:20:42.302 --> 01:20:45.387
- Oh, don't forget these.
- Oh, thanks.

01:20:45.555 --> 01:20:48.807
- There you go.
- Did you get my other gift?

01:20:48.975 --> 01:20:53.395
- We did.
- Yes, Basil, nice rack.

01:20:53.563 --> 01:20:56.065
But Who in the world
gave us this drawing?

01:20:56.232 --> 01:20:58.108
It's bizarre.

01:20:58.276 --> 01:21:01.946
Well, as you know,
Dr. Evil has escaped in his rocket...

01:21:02.113 --> 01:21:04.407
...which has disappeared
from our tracking system.

01:21:04.575 --> 01:21:06.660
- Oh, dear. Hold on. Coffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

01:21:06.827 --> 01:21:08.787
Okay. Thank you.

01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:13.458
Oh, and Vanessa, by the way,
you have been made a full agent.

01:21:13.626 --> 01:21:15.961
Oh, that's fantastic, Basil. Thanks.

01:21:16.128 --> 01:21:18.171
- Milk?
- Yes, please.

01:21:18.339 --> 01:21:23.218
Oh, and Austin, her Majesty, the Queen,
informs me that you are to be knighted.

01:21:23.386 --> 01:21:25.178
Very shagadelic.

01:21:25.346 --> 01:21:27.555
Well, the best of luck to both of you.

01:21:27.723 --> 01:21:30.725
- Thanks, Basil.
- Goodbye.

01:21:30.893 --> 01:21:35.605
You know, Vanessa,
I'll never forget the first time I saW you.

01:21:35.773 --> 01:21:38.692
You were so incredibly beautiful.

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:42.362
So incredibly sexy.

01:21:42.655 --> 01:21:45.115
I knew I had to have you...

01:21:45.616 --> 01:21:48.034
...right then and there.

01:21:49.495 --> 01:21:52.038
Did you feel the same way?

01:21:52.206 --> 01:21:54.416
Actually, I couldn't stop
staring at your teeth.

01:21:57.713 --> 01:22:00.506
Oh, I ordered some champagne. Come in.

01:22:00.841 --> 01:22:02.174
Oh, lovely, Austin.

01:22:02.342 --> 01:22:04.093
Right over there's fine, thank you.

01:22:04.261 --> 01:22:06.095
Let's go out on the terrace.

01:22:06.263 --> 01:22:08.222
It's a beautiful night,
we can look at the stars.

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.557
Smashing idea, baby.

01:22:09.725 --> 01:22:12.143
Yeah, look at you.

01:22:14.354 --> 01:22:16.605
Oh! Look out!

01:22:19.192 --> 01:22:21.736
That really hurt.

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:24.113
I'm gonna have a lump there, you idiot.

01:22:24.656 --> 01:22:28.117
Who throws a shoe? Honestly.

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:30.202
You fight like a woman.

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:47.094
Austin.

01:22:48.221 --> 01:22:50.765
Honestly, it's not mine.

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:52.309
No, use it.

01:23:17.668 --> 01:23:20.128
Look how beautiful the night sky is.

01:23:20.296 --> 01:23:22.464
Hey, isn't that the Big Dipper?

01:23:22.632 --> 01:23:25.842
Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.

01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:28.345
- Austin.
- Well, you know.

01:23:28.513 --> 01:23:32.849
- Hey, I've never seen that big star before.
- Yeah, what is that?

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:37.062
Good God.

01:23:41.734 --> 01:23:44.987
I'm gonna get you, Austin PoWers.

01:23:45.155 --> 01:23:48.699
It's fricking freezing in here,
Mr. Bigglesworth.

01:24:18.355 --> 01:24:21.566
Darling, you look fabulous.
Okay, baby, here we go.

01:24:21.733 --> 01:24:24.110
All right, there We go. Look at that face.

01:24:24.278 --> 01:24:27.155
Show me again, come on.
Bit of hair, bit of hair, bit of hair.

01:24:27.322 --> 01:24:31.659
Smashing. Okay. It's coming around noW.
Coming around. Yes.

01:24:31.827 --> 01:24:37.081
Yes, great. Yes, yes, yes.
No! No! No. No, it's not working.

01:24:37.249 --> 01:24:41.086
Darling, you go change, there you go.
Can you change her? Is that okay? All right?

01:24:41.254 --> 01:24:43.839
Very good. Very good.

01:24:44.007 --> 01:24:46.550
And right here.
Right here, looking right there.

01:24:46.718 --> 01:24:48.886
Looking right... I'm not even looking.

01:24:49.053 --> 01:24:53.640
Oh, you're wicked. You got your mojo
working overtime, darling. Yeah.

01:24:53.808 --> 01:24:56.101
Look, I'm not even shooting you,
it's insane.

01:24:56.269 --> 01:24:59.771
Smashing. Beautiful.
Come on, can I get a smile?

01:24:59.939 --> 01:25:04.109
Okay, come on. Come on, you boys,
get together, come on.

01:25:05.111 --> 01:25:08.155
Okay, good. Loving it.
Let's make a Vanessa sandwich.

01:25:08.323 --> 01:25:12.784
You're wearing horns, you're wearing horns.
Come on, Austin, give it to me. Go. Go...

01:25:12.952 --> 01:25:14.786
Oh, behave.

01:25:14.954 --> 01:25:20.250
Okay, you're an animal. An animal. Yes.

01:25:22.503 --> 01:25:27.883
Yes, that's it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just the top of the hair, that's all I want.

01:25:28.051 --> 01:25:30.719
Born, and shoot.
Again, try it one more time.

01:25:30.888 --> 01:25:34.974
And I'm born, and shoot. That's it, yeah.

01:25:35.142 --> 01:25:37.644
Let's go, come on, come on. Come on.

01:25:37.811 --> 01:25:41.981
Ignore this. Ignore this.
Ignore me doing this.

01:25:44.652 --> 01:25:46.819
Fabulous, darling.

01:25:50.824 --> 01:25:53.618
Go, go, go!

01:25:57.498 --> 01:26:00.375
Lord. Lord.

01:26:02.044 --> 01:26:04.545
Yes, yes, yes. Okay, shoW me eyes.
