00:06.793 --> 00:09.068
14 hours ago, a distress
call was picked up,

00:09.137 --> 00:11.068
and "The Blue" was found,
no one on board.

00:11.137 --> 00:13.758
There's something
I'd like you to hear.

00:13.827 --> 00:15.034
"The Blue"--
we're in trouble.

00:15.103 --> 00:16.344
We need help.
Can you hear me?

00:16.413 --> 00:18.034
Hey, what did you find?

00:18.103 --> 00:20.448
They're uncut diamonds,
they're worth 1 and 1/2 mil.

00:20.517 --> 00:22.137
He's got this
idea that there was

00:22.206 --> 00:23.758
something dodgy about that
money we found.

00:23.827 --> 00:24.931
It was a setup.
Was it?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.517
I don't know.

00:26.586 --> 00:28.344
Miss, take my hand!

00:28.413 --> 00:29.896
This is not a place
for tourists.

00:29.965 --> 00:32.034
It was a ransom,
paid by our family

00:32.103 --> 00:34.758
to get back their kidnapped son
from the BLF.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.896
He wasn't just my brother.
He was my captain.

00:36.965 --> 00:39.586
It's actually my wife's
anniversary tomorrow,

00:39.655 --> 00:41.000
the night she died.

00:41.068 --> 00:42.689
- You think we can trust him?
- What the--

00:42.758 --> 00:45.379
- Stop!
- Aah!

00:45.448 --> 00:47.241
- She's dead.
- Confess!

00:47.310 --> 00:48.724
We are murderers.
Confess.

00:48.793 --> 00:50.689
- Confess!
- No!

00:50.758 --> 00:52.931
- What are you doing?
- I need you to jump.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.068
Anything is better than
staying on this boat.

00:56.689 --> 00:59.620
- I killed Joseph. It was me.
- Kit, you need to jump.

00:59.689 --> 01:01.931
- You're safer without me.
- I'll wait for you.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.310
- What's going on?
- Got a survivor.

01:03.379 --> 01:05.137
- Kitty and the others...?
- I couldn't stop it.

01:05.206 --> 01:07.482
It's very brave
for you to come here.

01:07.551 --> 01:08.862
Now tell me everything.

01:13.379 --> 01:15.896
You told me that I pushed
Joseph, but I didn't.

01:15.965 --> 01:17.068
It's okay.

01:19.310 --> 01:20.413
It was you.

01:28.724 --> 01:30.068
What are you doing?

01:30.137 --> 01:32.103
Nothing, nothing.

01:32.172 --> 01:33.275
See?

01:33.344 --> 01:36.206
- You lied to me.
- No, put that down.

01:36.275 --> 01:38.517
- You lied to me.
- Kitty, put the knife down.

01:38.586 --> 01:40.413
- You killed Joseph! Not me!
- Put it down.

01:40.482 --> 01:42.482
Denny.

01:42.551 --> 01:44.137
Aaron, Aaron!

01:46.551 --> 01:48.206
Hey, why's the door locked?

01:48.275 --> 01:50.413
Don't you fucking dare.

01:50.482 --> 01:51.758
- Aaron.
- Kitty, put it down.

01:51.827 --> 01:53.586
Aaron, we need to call
the police,

01:53.655 --> 01:55.482
and we need to
get to shore now.

01:55.551 --> 01:56.862
Now!
What's going on?

01:56.931 --> 01:59.172
Come on, hey, hey.
We need to talk now, okay?

01:59.241 --> 02:00.275
All of us.

02:00.344 --> 02:02.620
No, he killed Joseph, not me.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.103
- He didn't.
- He did.

02:05.172 --> 02:08.413
Hey, just think about
what you're saying, Aaron.

02:08.482 --> 02:10.413
It was me.

02:14.206 --> 02:17.344
I killed him.

02:31.862 --> 02:35.379
♪ All the things
that I ran from ♪

02:35.448 --> 02:41.275
♪ I now bring as close
to me as I can ♪

02:41.344 --> 02:46.448
♪ Ripping hotel sheets
with gritted teeth ♪

02:46.517 --> 02:49.413
♪ My montage of lost things ♪

02:49.482 --> 02:54.413
♪ My shiny ♪

02:54.482 --> 02:58.862
♪ Trinkets of grief ♪

03:03.620 --> 03:05.551
Give me the knife.

03:16.896 --> 03:20.137
What's up with the gun?
Did you kill someone, Den?

03:20.206 --> 03:22.551
You know you can be a very
persuasive piece of shit.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.517
Oh, persuasive.
So, what, this is my fault?

03:24.586 --> 03:25.758
Yeah, partly, partly.

03:25.827 --> 03:28.241
Don't you try
to screw me here.

03:28.310 --> 03:29.551
Okay?

03:29.620 --> 03:31.344
Joseph deserved to
go in the water.

03:31.413 --> 03:32.896
He would have put
us all in jail.

03:32.965 --> 03:36.689
You did what needed to be done,
like I'm doing now...

03:36.758 --> 03:38.137
like I did with Helen.

03:38.206 --> 03:39.448
You won't go there.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.689
Cleaning up after your mess,

03:41.758 --> 03:43.896
making it look
like you were never there.

03:46.448 --> 03:48.000
We both know
why you did that,

03:48.068 --> 03:50.862
you deceitful piece of shit.
Why? Why?

03:50.931 --> 03:53.586
'Cause she OD'd and then
you ran, left her dead--

03:53.655 --> 03:55.206
pregnant and dead.

03:55.275 --> 03:57.620
You left me to fix it.
Don't, Den.

03:57.689 --> 04:00.965
Like we need
to fix this now...

04:01.034 --> 04:02.206
right now.

04:02.275 --> 04:05.724
You really think
that helped me, hmm?

04:05.793 --> 04:10.482
All your life, all you done
is lie to me...

04:10.551 --> 04:12.275
screw me over--

04:12.344 --> 04:16.517
scams, fuck people over,
fucked me over, Helen!

04:16.586 --> 04:18.862
You fucked
your own life, Aaron.

04:18.931 --> 04:21.965
Maybe you should be
in fucking prison.

04:22.034 --> 04:24.172
I mean, that'd make you
happy, wouldn't it, Kitty?

04:24.241 --> 04:27.275
No, don't even fucking--
Tell me the truth!

04:27.344 --> 04:28.620
Tell me!

04:28.689 --> 04:31.931
For once in your life,
tell me the truth.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.413
Hmm?

04:34.482 --> 04:37.172
What?

04:37.241 --> 04:40.241
I cleaned up the mess your
junkie ass left, that's all.

04:40.310 --> 04:41.758
Say it.

04:41.827 --> 04:44.310
Say it, Denny.
What? Say what?

04:44.379 --> 04:46.482
Say it!

04:52.413 --> 04:53.758
Say it.

05:04.034 --> 05:06.068
Who do you think
was there for her, Aaron?

05:09.551 --> 05:12.000
It wasn't you.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.172
You fucking ignored her.

05:19.379 --> 05:22.689
She was so lonely...

05:22.758 --> 05:25.931
She took an overdose.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.689
And then you left her
and the baby to go cold.

05:31.517 --> 05:34.517
It's a shame...

05:34.586 --> 05:36.517
a real shame.

05:45.517 --> 05:48.379
I'd love to have been a father,

05:48.448 --> 05:50.827
but my baby died with Helen.

06:06.655 --> 06:07.896
Aah!

06:18.655 --> 06:21.068
I made mistakes, Den,

06:21.137 --> 06:24.206
but it's you who made
the biggest of them all.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.413
You're okay.

06:42.482 --> 06:44.275
You're okay.

06:56.448 --> 06:58.724
Back in the Philippines,
our theory

06:58.793 --> 07:01.310
was that Navarro tipped
someone off

07:01.379 --> 07:03.931
about the drop point
for the ransom--

07:04.000 --> 07:06.172
a Westerner with
gambling debts.

07:06.241 --> 07:07.793
Denny.

07:07.862 --> 07:12.482
Yeah, Denny steered us to it.
He used me to steer us to it.

07:12.551 --> 07:14.724
Because...

07:14.793 --> 07:18.000
he knew exactly where it was.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.517
Oh, wait.

07:21.586 --> 07:25.103
This whole thing was all him.

07:25.172 --> 07:26.482
Yeah.

07:28.896 --> 07:32.482
So you see why he
might act ruthlessly?

07:32.551 --> 07:33.862
It's to cover his tracks.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.655
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

07:35.724 --> 07:37.482
I left Kitty alone with him.

07:37.551 --> 07:38.931
He's--

07:39.000 --> 07:40.344
This...

07:40.413 --> 07:42.793
This man,
this Dennis Winbourne,

07:42.862 --> 07:45.724
he is dangerous.

07:45.793 --> 07:48.344
But I'm out of my jurisdiction.

07:48.413 --> 07:50.724
And the Australian police
are not exactly my friends.

07:50.793 --> 07:52.275
Wait, so what are you saying?

07:52.344 --> 07:55.758
He--he can walk away and
I have to forget about Kitty?

07:55.827 --> 07:59.103
Dennis lied about so much.

07:59.172 --> 08:00.689
Who knows what else
he might be hiding?

08:00.758 --> 08:02.655
Well, then we have to make
him tell the truth.

08:02.724 --> 08:05.103
Then I need more evidence,

08:05.172 --> 08:07.586
something that proves
that "The Blue" was involved

08:07.655 --> 08:08.758
in what happened in Bulakan.

08:08.827 --> 08:10.551
Okay, okay.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.379
Uh, if...

08:15.448 --> 08:18.551
if we get him
and if he goes to jail...

08:20.793 --> 08:23.379
What happens to me?

08:23.448 --> 08:25.655
If you help me,

08:25.724 --> 08:27.862
I can get you to
the Philippines as a witness.

08:27.931 --> 08:29.931
And after that?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.034
The legal system
in the Philippines,

08:32.103 --> 08:35.896
in my country,
it's a little bit more porous.

08:35.965 --> 08:39.379
After you testify,
you can slip away.

08:42.172 --> 08:45.586
And you can make that happen?

08:45.655 --> 08:47.551
I want justice, too.

09:06.034 --> 09:08.448
I have what you need.

09:11.103 --> 09:14.241
I have evidence.

09:14.310 --> 09:16.620
But we've got to go
back to the house.

09:31.551 --> 09:33.448
What's going on?

09:36.379 --> 09:38.137
Nothing.

09:38.206 --> 09:40.275
Just couldn't sleep.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.793
It's late.
You should come back to bed.

10:21.827 --> 10:22.931
Yeah.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.551
Hey, what's wrong?

11:17.620 --> 11:19.931
Uh...

11:20.000 --> 11:21.586
watch the door.
Hey, hey--

11:21.655 --> 11:24.034
Just watch the door!
He killed--he killed Aaron.

11:24.103 --> 11:27.068
Shell!

11:36.206 --> 11:39.241
Shell.

11:41.379 --> 11:42.896
Okay.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.793
Hello. This is "The Blue."
This is "The Blue."

11:49.862 --> 11:52.758
We need help. We need help.
Come on, this is an emergency.

11:52.827 --> 11:54.517
Come on!

12:00.620 --> 12:02.241
It's fine.

12:26.344 --> 12:29.413
Here...

12:31.793 --> 12:33.793
This'll keep you safe..

12:39.310 --> 12:41.551
H-hey, Denny?

12:41.620 --> 12:43.068
Ric.

12:46.103 --> 12:48.379
Hey, Den.

12:48.448 --> 12:51.896
What's happening, man?

12:51.965 --> 12:54.931
- Ric?
- Den.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.931
Hey. Ricky?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.068
Yeah, what's going on?

13:00.137 --> 13:02.482
Um...

13:02.551 --> 13:05.724
hey, Kitty cut Aaron, Ric.

13:05.793 --> 13:07.655
He's unconscious.

13:10.068 --> 13:11.827
He's bleeding, Ric.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.655
Please, I need help, Ric.

13:23.275 --> 13:26.137
Oh, my God.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.413
Aaron.

13:28.482 --> 13:31.172
You...

13:31.241 --> 13:33.241
you murdered Aaron?

13:33.310 --> 13:34.724
That's a fucking lie, Ric.

13:34.793 --> 13:36.724
This whole time,
you're playing with me.

13:36.793 --> 13:38.620
Don't say that, Ric.

13:47.172 --> 13:49.689
Kitty! Kitty!
Aah!

13:51.241 --> 13:52.827
Hello? Hello?

13:52.896 --> 13:54.965
Can you hear me?

13:55.034 --> 13:57.482
Come on!

13:57.551 --> 14:01.172
MOL Triumph to "The Blue,"
reading you.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.724
H-h-hello?
We're in trouble.

14:02.793 --> 14:05.000
We need help.
Can you hear me?

14:05.068 --> 14:06.655
Fuck, can you hear me?
Hello?

14:12.724 --> 14:14.931
You should have stayed
away, mate.

14:22.965 --> 14:24.551
Oh.

14:28.413 --> 14:30.827
Why didn't you just stay away?

14:41.275 --> 14:42.724
Yeah.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.482
Are you able to give
your position?

14:47.551 --> 14:49.551
Position?

14:49.620 --> 14:51.655
I don't know our position.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.344
Oh, God. I don't know--
I don't know where we are.

14:55.413 --> 14:58.793
Oh, God, he's dead, he's dead!

14:58.862 --> 15:00.965
Please, can you hear me?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.482
Please!

15:02.551 --> 15:04.448
Come on, plea--

15:10.724 --> 15:15.586
Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty...

15:15.655 --> 15:17.655
Kitty, Kitty, Kitty,
Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.

15:20.689 --> 15:22.793
Kit...

15:26.137 --> 15:29.000
What are you doing, Kitty?

15:29.068 --> 15:30.448
Kitty.

15:35.793 --> 15:38.620
No, please! No, please!

15:38.689 --> 15:41.482
No!

15:41.551 --> 15:45.620
Aah! No!

15:45.689 --> 15:47.896
No, please!

15:50.034 --> 15:52.275
You think I want to do this?

16:09.689 --> 16:12.344
Aaron's dead because of you...

16:12.413 --> 16:14.034
all because of you.

16:17.517 --> 16:20.241
Please, Denny, please.

16:20.310 --> 16:23.310
I wish you had just
killed yourself.

16:23.379 --> 16:26.241
Stupid bitch!

16:36.482 --> 16:39.344
Get the fuck away from her.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.000
Back up, Denny.

17:01.137 --> 17:03.896
Back up, Denny.

17:13.344 --> 17:15.413
I didn't do it, Shell.

17:15.482 --> 17:17.413
He did. He did.

17:17.482 --> 17:19.172
- Get on your knees.
- I tried to save him.

17:19.241 --> 17:21.965
I said get on your knees!

17:22.034 --> 17:23.448
Kitty...

17:23.517 --> 17:28.000
the, uh, inflatable lifeboat,
go get it.

17:28.068 --> 17:29.758
It's behind me.

17:29.827 --> 17:32.448
It's under some tarp.
Go!

17:37.068 --> 17:38.586
Do you see it?

17:38.655 --> 17:41.275
- Where is it?
- It's underneath the tarp!

17:47.172 --> 17:48.379
Now get up.

17:49.931 --> 17:51.517
I said get up!

17:57.000 --> 17:58.448
Are you done?

17:58.517 --> 18:01.000
- Am I tying it to the side?
- Yes.

18:01.068 --> 18:03.275
Okay. Okay.

18:03.344 --> 18:04.448
Back up.

18:08.137 --> 18:10.655
Keep backing up.

18:18.517 --> 18:20.344
I did it!

18:25.103 --> 18:28.172
Denny...

18:28.241 --> 18:30.000
now get down there and get in.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.655
I didn't do it, Shell.

18:32.724 --> 18:34.620
I said get in!

18:52.275 --> 18:53.931
You're killing me.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.068
We're not safe
while you're on this boat.

18:58.862 --> 19:00.206
So get in.

19:05.655 --> 19:07.482
Kitty, throw in the line.

19:07.551 --> 19:09.034
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

19:09.103 --> 19:12.689
No one will find me.
You know I'll die out there.

19:12.758 --> 19:15.241
We'll get help
when we're on the shore.

19:15.310 --> 19:18.000
We are not murderers!

19:35.413 --> 19:37.000
I'm not.

21:00.172 --> 21:02.793
I need more time.

21:18.517 --> 21:19.965
I understand.

21:29.655 --> 21:30.793
Hey.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.310
Where are your parents?

21:38.379 --> 21:41.482
Oh, they've gone away...

21:41.551 --> 21:43.620
visiting my uncle.

21:45.896 --> 21:48.931
We have the place to ourselves.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.517
Yeah, I was actually
thinking I might head--

21:50.586 --> 21:52.275
Hey, Lana, um...

21:54.758 --> 21:57.103
We got to get serious here.

22:00.655 --> 22:03.758
Come here.

22:13.827 --> 22:16.620
All this shit...

22:16.689 --> 22:19.965
I just...

22:20.034 --> 22:23.172
I just want to get
out of here.

22:24.724 --> 22:26.344
Hmm.

22:29.448 --> 22:30.862
Out of Oz.

22:37.344 --> 22:40.862
Out of Townsville.

22:54.655 --> 22:57.620
Get back out there...

22:57.689 --> 23:01.068
two dots on the horizon.

23:01.137 --> 23:02.758
But...

23:02.827 --> 23:06.000
I don't have any money.

23:06.068 --> 23:08.965
But we do have
the diamonds, right?

23:09.034 --> 23:12.068
No.

23:12.137 --> 23:13.724
No.

23:13.793 --> 23:17.413
I-I don't...

23:17.482 --> 23:20.103
Where are they, Lana?

23:20.172 --> 23:22.413
They're on--
they're on "The Blue."

23:27.551 --> 23:29.344
I don't believe you.

23:29.413 --> 23:31.068
They were causing
so much trouble,

23:31.137 --> 23:35.068
I just didn't want anything
to do with them, so I...

23:35.137 --> 23:37.724
um...

23:37.793 --> 23:39.448
I hid them.

23:42.310 --> 23:44.241
Where?

23:44.310 --> 23:46.206
Um...

23:46.275 --> 23:48.413
in the storeroom.

23:50.655 --> 23:52.724
- In the storeroom?
- Yeah.

23:55.379 --> 23:57.551
Let's get them now.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.413
The...

23:59.482 --> 24:01.827
the boat's blocked off.
The police are there--

24:01.896 --> 24:04.379
Let's get them now.

24:04.448 --> 24:06.413
Come on.

24:26.310 --> 24:28.862
This is crazy.
It's too dangerous.

24:28.931 --> 24:30.655
Just relax.

24:30.724 --> 24:32.655
Like we work here.

24:32.724 --> 24:34.827
Look...

24:34.896 --> 24:36.793
forensics are finished.

24:36.862 --> 24:38.344
The search has been called off.

24:38.413 --> 24:40.413
Security is going
to be way down.

24:40.482 --> 24:42.137
It's still a crime scene,
so if they catch us--

24:42.206 --> 24:43.586
They'll give us a warning,
then they'll send us home.

24:43.655 --> 24:44.862
No, stop!

24:44.931 --> 24:46.517
What the fuck are you doing?

24:47.965 --> 24:49.344
I can't get arrested.

24:49.413 --> 24:51.655
Lana...

24:51.724 --> 24:53.793
don't let everything we've been
through be for nothing.

24:53.862 --> 24:55.517
Then you do it.

24:55.586 --> 25:00.517
But if you force me
onto that boat, I'll scream.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.379
Then scream.

25:10.137 --> 25:12.241
Remember, I know
what you've done.

25:12.310 --> 25:15.413
So you go telling tales...

25:15.482 --> 25:17.551
you suffer.

25:31.965 --> 25:34.034
Miss, can I help you?

25:34.103 --> 25:37.137
Yeah, uh, just looking
for the reception desk.

25:37.206 --> 25:39.206
Actually, um,
I have just noticed

25:39.275 --> 25:41.827
the guy wandering down there.

25:41.896 --> 25:44.034
Looks a bit dodgy to me.

26:15.482 --> 26:17.241
Thought you were going to run
out on me.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.448
Yeah, well,
I had to get rid of him.

26:50.517 --> 26:52.275
Kitty, wake up.

26:56.586 --> 26:58.103
Kitty.

27:00.758 --> 27:02.517
Over here.

27:19.344 --> 27:21.758
Get the emergency flag
from the sail locker.

27:21.827 --> 27:24.862
I'll turn the boat around.

27:24.931 --> 27:28.655
We get closer, we improve
our chances of being seen.

27:36.931 --> 27:39.965
Where is it?

27:40.034 --> 27:43.172
The autopilot's been shifted.

27:43.241 --> 27:45.517
This whole time
we've been circling.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.551
Shh.

28:16.620 --> 28:19.827
You thought Aaron's watch was
on "The Blue"?

28:19.896 --> 28:21.448
Yeah.

28:21.517 --> 28:23.758
I knew he would have wanted me
to have it.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.551
Oh, and rather than call us,

28:26.620 --> 28:30.689
you decide to sneak
into a secure crime scene.

28:30.758 --> 28:32.482
Well, to you
it's a crime scene.

28:32.551 --> 28:34.655
To me, it's my brother's boat.

28:34.724 --> 28:38.172
Let's cut the crap, Dennis,
all right?

28:38.241 --> 28:39.931
You're lying
about why you came here,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.206
and you're also lying

28:41.275 --> 28:43.758
about what happened
on that boat, too.

28:43.827 --> 28:47.068
No, I've told you the truth,
right from the start.

28:52.862 --> 28:55.275
Am I being charged?

28:56.310 --> 28:57.620
Not as yet.

29:03.379 --> 29:05.379
Well, then I...

29:05.448 --> 29:07.793
I'd like to go home, please.

29:13.206 --> 29:15.034
Wait, wait.

29:15.103 --> 29:17.586
Hello?

29:17.655 --> 29:20.620
Anyone home?

29:24.241 --> 29:26.068
It's in the bottom of here,
but I don't know

29:26.137 --> 29:28.000
if I can reach.
Let me, let me.

29:29.482 --> 29:32.448
What am I--
It's a key, there.

29:32.517 --> 29:34.344
I was worried that someone was
going to go through my stuff,

29:34.413 --> 29:36.896
so I just hid it, and I--

29:36.965 --> 29:39.965
Wait, what--what's this?

29:40.034 --> 29:42.586
I thought we were getting
diamonds.

29:49.620 --> 29:50.827
What?

29:50.896 --> 29:52.241
Wait.

29:54.103 --> 29:56.827
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Uh...

29:56.896 --> 29:58.655
No.

29:58.724 --> 30:00.689
You work for them.

30:00.758 --> 30:02.344
Yes.

30:03.655 --> 30:05.137
A long time ago.

30:05.206 --> 30:09.344
But with those people,
once is enough.

30:09.413 --> 30:11.620
Tell me, what's this?

30:11.689 --> 30:12.862
No, I trusted you,

30:12.931 --> 30:14.103
and you said you were
going to help me.

30:14.172 --> 30:15.620
Trust?

30:15.689 --> 30:19.137
You people come to my country,
fuck everything up,

30:19.206 --> 30:21.689
then you complain
about the mess you made

30:21.758 --> 30:23.758
like you're the victims.

30:25.103 --> 30:26.620
Y-yeah, that's why
I want to get Denny.

30:26.689 --> 30:29.793
I want to make this right.
What about you, Lana?

30:29.862 --> 30:34.448
What you did--
who will put that right?

30:36.310 --> 30:38.965
You think I want to do this?

30:39.034 --> 30:40.896
You think I give the orders?

30:40.965 --> 30:45.275
These people, this BLF--
they make my country bleed.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.862
So, if I don't do
what they say,

30:47.931 --> 30:50.103
my family will die.

30:50.172 --> 30:52.241
My son will die,

30:52.310 --> 30:55.206
all because
of the diamonds you took.

30:55.275 --> 30:57.482
You understand now?

30:57.551 --> 30:59.000
I'm sorry.

30:59.068 --> 31:01.068
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

31:04.827 --> 31:07.068
Wait.

31:07.137 --> 31:08.689
Fuck.

31:08.758 --> 31:10.551
Shit.

31:28.206 --> 31:30.551
I told you not
to trust this guy.

31:34.103 --> 31:35.344
What?

31:43.310 --> 31:45.724
You set it all up...

31:48.172 --> 31:50.517
The diamonds...

31:50.586 --> 31:53.482
Navarro.

31:53.551 --> 31:56.206
Have you been listening
to his bullshit?

32:01.655 --> 32:04.586
Trying to trick me...

32:04.655 --> 32:05.827
again?

32:05.896 --> 32:07.758
I-I, uh, couldn't find
the diamonds--

32:07.827 --> 32:10.172
You need to tell me
what happened to Kitty,

32:10.241 --> 32:11.793
'cause she's all I've got.

32:11.862 --> 32:15.000
She's my family,
so you need to tell me.

32:15.068 --> 32:16.965
You need to tell me.

32:22.344 --> 32:23.793
Did you kill her?

32:28.310 --> 32:29.793
Did you?

32:32.310 --> 32:34.103
The Kitty thing, um...

32:34.172 --> 32:36.724
Fuck. Uh...

32:39.655 --> 32:40.896
No.

32:40.965 --> 32:42.931
No?

32:43.000 --> 32:44.517
No, I didn't kill Kitty.

32:44.586 --> 32:47.793
- She's alive?
- Yeah.

32:50.862 --> 32:53.241
She's alive?

32:53.310 --> 32:56.137
The last time you saw her,
she was alive?

32:56.206 --> 32:58.620
Sure, yeah.

33:03.586 --> 33:06.862
Well, then she's
going to die out there, so...

33:09.482 --> 33:12.482
We need to tell the police.

33:12.551 --> 33:14.448
We need to tell them the truth.
Oh...

33:14.517 --> 33:16.655
And it's my fault,
so I need to--

33:16.724 --> 33:18.241
Oh, fuck, what are you--
No, hey, no.

33:18.310 --> 33:19.551
You tell Craven--

33:19.620 --> 33:21.793
Kitty got into
that because of me, so...

33:21.862 --> 33:24.689
Fuck, well,
that's a stupid idea.

33:34.103 --> 33:36.482
You're insane.

33:47.724 --> 33:49.862
Help me!

33:51.344 --> 33:53.206
I don't want to
hurt you, Lana.

33:53.275 --> 33:55.068
I just...

33:58.172 --> 34:01.137
I just want to talk.

34:06.793 --> 34:10.137
You know, we could
have done it, Lana--run away!

34:14.379 --> 34:16.034
It would have been amazing.

34:25.034 --> 34:27.517
But you would just
not let it go.

34:34.379 --> 34:36.413
All about Kitty.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.931
Oh, it must be hard...

34:47.827 --> 34:49.931
Knowing she's out there...

34:52.000 --> 34:53.931
Somewhere.

35:00.448 --> 35:04.862
I just want to be with Lana.

35:24.517 --> 35:27.655
Rubber duck...

35:43.827 --> 35:46.931
♪ Rubber duck ♪

35:52.448 --> 35:54.448
♪ She came unstuck ♪

35:59.275 --> 36:01.275
♪ Ruddy duck ♪

36:37.310 --> 36:39.137
Denny!

36:39.206 --> 36:41.551
Denny, Denny.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.517
Denny, stop it.

36:43.586 --> 36:45.034
Stop now!

36:47.862 --> 36:49.586
- Please.
- Give me the gun.

36:55.137 --> 36:58.551
Stop.
Please, stop, please.

36:58.620 --> 37:01.448
Denny, stop!

37:21.482 --> 37:25.448
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

37:25.517 --> 37:27.689
Kitty, we need--
we need to get off the boat.

37:27.758 --> 37:28.965
We need to--
Okay.

37:29.034 --> 37:31.793
I'm sorry.
We need to get off the boat.

37:31.862 --> 37:34.137
Okay, okay.

38:03.655 --> 38:05.379
I'm gonna put you in the raft.

38:05.448 --> 38:07.551
Okay, okay.

38:10.310 --> 38:12.172
You're gonna get in.

38:13.896 --> 38:16.206
Come on. Come on!

38:28.103 --> 38:29.413
Okay.

38:29.482 --> 38:32.413
Come on.
Come on!

38:42.827 --> 38:45.689
Okay, there.

38:45.758 --> 38:48.344
I'm gonna get you up.

39:16.862 --> 39:19.275
- Kitty, jump! Jump!
- Ah!

39:19.344 --> 39:20.793
I have to stay.

39:20.862 --> 39:23.758
Kitty! Kitty!

39:23.827 --> 39:26.068
Kitty, jump!

39:27.724 --> 39:30.724
Please!
No! No, no.

39:30.793 --> 39:33.413
Denny, please.

39:33.482 --> 39:35.448
Hey!

39:35.517 --> 39:37.275
Listen to me!

39:37.344 --> 39:39.103
Listen to me.

39:39.172 --> 39:41.931
You're going to need someone
to help sail with you

39:42.000 --> 39:43.517
to Townsville, aren't you?

39:43.586 --> 39:45.862
Hey! Listen to me!
Shh.

39:45.931 --> 39:49.862
You're gonna need
someone to help you sail,

39:49.931 --> 39:51.689
and I can be that person.

39:51.758 --> 39:53.241
Okay?

39:53.310 --> 39:56.103
I can help you.

39:56.172 --> 39:59.344
I just want to be with Lana.

40:12.551 --> 40:14.413
Reyes.

40:42.310 --> 40:44.068
Okay.

40:46.482 --> 40:48.241
Come on.

40:51.172 --> 40:54.551
Oh, come on.

42:55.103 --> 42:58.793
You know, you act like
this is all about Kitty.

42:58.862 --> 43:02.034
Whose fault is it all, really?

43:02.103 --> 43:04.413
Oh, no, that was you.

43:04.482 --> 43:07.172
It's all you.

43:07.241 --> 43:09.206
You!
It was you!

43:09.275 --> 43:11.482
- Yeah? Yeah, it's me?
- Yeah.

43:11.551 --> 43:13.137
Fuck you!

43:13.206 --> 43:15.586
Abandon her
for a bunch of diamonds,

43:15.655 --> 43:18.827
then hide them from her!

43:18.896 --> 43:21.000
Oh, no, that was you.

43:21.068 --> 43:23.965
That was you.

43:24.034 --> 43:26.620
Well, do it, then.

43:26.689 --> 43:29.586
Do it.

43:29.655 --> 43:32.448
You know, we really
are the same, Lana.

43:34.655 --> 43:37.068
You don't see it?

43:37.137 --> 43:40.482
Because I did, I did,
straightaway.

43:40.551 --> 43:44.206
You did whatever it took
to save your own as,

43:44.275 --> 43:47.172
no matter who got hurt!

43:49.103 --> 43:51.758
Even your precious
best friend.

43:51.827 --> 43:54.965
I love that about you, Lana!

43:55.034 --> 43:57.724
But everything great...

43:57.793 --> 44:01.517
is just as difficult to realize

44:01.586 --> 44:06.000
as it is...

44:06.068 --> 44:09.172
rare to find.

44:35.379 --> 44:36.862
Kitty.

44:59.034 --> 45:02.620
What the fuck
happened here, Emma?

45:02.689 --> 45:05.068
My name's not Emma.

45:05.137 --> 45:07.068
I'm sorry.

45:07.137 --> 45:10.068
I'm sorry.

45:22.586 --> 45:24.379
Sandra hated me

45:24.448 --> 45:26.344
from the minute I came
to live with her.

45:26.413 --> 45:28.689
I don't think I was
what she expected

45:28.758 --> 45:31.103
from a good little girl.

45:31.172 --> 45:33.931
Kit made me feel...

45:34.000 --> 45:36.482
wanted and...

45:36.551 --> 45:38.413
loved.

45:41.551 --> 45:44.275
We just looked
after each other.

45:46.551 --> 45:49.758
And then when it happened
and Sandra fell,

45:49.827 --> 45:52.724
I knew I couldn't let
Kit take the blame.

45:52.793 --> 45:55.931
So I just got this
idea in my head that we...

45:56.000 --> 45:58.206
run away...

45:58.275 --> 46:00.413
and be together, just us.
Stand by.

46:00.482 --> 46:05.000
I just wanted her...

46:05.068 --> 46:07.000
to myself.

46:07.068 --> 46:09.655
He's not breathing.

46:11.172 --> 46:12.655
But...

46:14.517 --> 46:18.655
Whatever has happened to Kitty
is my fault.

46:20.310 --> 46:22.241
Well, what you told us
checked out

46:22.310 --> 46:24.862
with the UK
crime scene report, so...

46:24.931 --> 46:26.551
I think you need to restart
the search now.

46:26.620 --> 46:28.448
That's the first thing I did.

46:28.517 --> 46:31.827
That's why I went back out
to the house, to...

46:31.896 --> 46:35.241
give Dennis another shake,
but I never dreamt--

46:35.310 --> 46:37.275
That stuff that Denny said

46:37.344 --> 46:40.655
about the--
the attack on the boat--

46:40.724 --> 46:44.103
Well, so far, we're
operating on the assumption

46:44.172 --> 46:46.448
that the whole thing
was staged.

46:46.517 --> 46:49.103
Dennis shot
"The Blue" up himself

46:49.172 --> 46:51.206
and then dumped
any of the evidence

46:51.275 --> 46:53.413
that contradicted his story.

46:53.482 --> 46:56.620
When he was happy with the way
everything was set up,

46:56.689 --> 47:00.034
he then set "The Blue"
on a course to Townsville--

47:00.103 --> 47:02.724
make sure she was found.

47:02.793 --> 47:06.413
And then he got
in the tender...

47:06.482 --> 47:09.931
waited to be rescued.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.620
He took Kitty's phone.

47:13.689 --> 47:17.137
Why?
Souvenir, maybe.

47:18.482 --> 47:21.448
Or to find you.

47:51.793 --> 47:53.931
Sorry, Mariel.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.379
I'm really sorry.

48:04.724 --> 48:07.206
So, if I am under arrest,

48:07.275 --> 48:11.275
I get to make
a phone call, right?

48:11.344 --> 48:13.413
Yeah.

48:27.620 --> 48:28.965
Hello?

48:30.793 --> 48:32.000
Lana?

48:32.068 --> 48:35.448
You were right.

48:35.517 --> 48:40.241
We started this,
and I just--I want it to end.

48:40.310 --> 48:44.310
I don't want anyone else
to get hurt, so...

48:44.379 --> 48:46.517
Townsville bus station.

48:46.586 --> 48:50.034
You'll find
what you need there.

48:50.103 --> 48:52.862
And there's something
for Joseph's sister as well.

48:52.931 --> 48:56.586
- Where to, mate?
- The bus terminal.

48:56.655 --> 48:59.379
Really?
Okay, thank you.

48:59.448 --> 49:01.482
Lana, you are not going
to believe this.

49:01.551 --> 49:03.448
I've just been told
we found a survivor.

49:03.517 --> 49:05.482
- From "The Blue"?
- From "The Blue."

49:05.551 --> 49:08.482
She's being flown in right now.

50:22.551 --> 50:24.689
I'm so sorry.

50:30.344 --> 50:33.068
Hey, Kitty.
Kitty, jump!

50:33.137 --> 50:36.310
Kitty! Kitty!

50:36.379 --> 50:40.206
I just want to be with Lana.

50:40.275 --> 50:42.517
That's all I want.

50:42.586 --> 50:45.862
No one is going to know

50:45.931 --> 50:47.724
what you've done.

50:49.862 --> 50:51.896
You must really think I'm--

51:02.241 --> 51:04.310
I just want to be with Lana.

51:04.379 --> 51:06.551
I just want to be with Lana!

51:10.827 --> 51:12.413
Lana...

51:16.310 --> 51:18.379
Lana...

51:20.241 --> 51:23.103
Kitty!

51:27.068 --> 51:29.862
He threw her body
in the water.

51:38.413 --> 51:40.896
She saved my life.

51:43.310 --> 51:46.931
Yeah...

51:47.000 --> 51:48.931
mine, too.

53:12.965 --> 53:16.724
I don't think I would've
survived all the Sandra stuff

53:16.793 --> 53:18.862
if it weren't for you.

53:21.344 --> 53:23.034
Yeah, you would.

53:25.172 --> 53:28.448
And, anyway,
we're connected here...

53:28.517 --> 53:30.551
joined forever.

53:34.379 --> 53:38.137
I'll always be there
for you, right there.
