WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:02.912
- Previously on Haven...

00:03.045 --> 00:04.910
I need to know more about her.

00:05.047 --> 00:07.038
- Best way to find out
if your mother came through here

00:07.174 --> 00:08.289
is to be a local cop.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.167
- When you get a badge,
you get to harass me.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.464
- Because you're
a low-life criminal.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.087
[laughing]
- That's a good one.

00:15.224 --> 00:18.057
- You're just using people
like you always do.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.050
Are you planning
on using Audrey too?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.353
- Oh.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.440
You look, uh, nice.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.557
- Nice?

00:32.157 --> 00:33.237
- Am I interrupting something?

00:36.245 --> 00:38.076
- I can't take
your restaurant, Bill.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.661
- You are the spitting image

00:39.790 --> 00:41.906
of someone I sold flowers to
years ago.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.124
- What was her name?
- Lucy.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.084
I believe it was Lucy.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.547
- Our grandmama could cast
farther than you,

00:54.680 --> 00:55.795
much farther.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.013
- Yeah, well,
Grandmama was pretty tough,

00:58.141 --> 01:00.348
so I'll take that
as a compliment.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.263
- Take it
however you like.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.932
- Let's see what you got.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.433
- Watch and learn, brother.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.943
I believe our grandma's
doing a little jig in her grave.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.281
[laughs]

01:16.410 --> 01:17.775
Oh, crap.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.529
- Yeah, I think I heard her
just fall and break a hip...

01:21.665 --> 01:22.620
again.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.250
- I'm caught up
on that boat.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.661
I'll cut the line.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.625
- No, no, don't do that.
That's my favorite lure.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.790
Besides, I don't think
that boat's tied.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.460
See if you can reel it in.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.457
- [grunts softly]

01:33.594 --> 01:36.301
I wonder whose dinghy that is.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.804
- Good job.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.096
- All right, grab her.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.344
- [grunts]

01:45.480 --> 01:47.436
Oh, those lobsters reek.

01:47.566 --> 01:48.806
- What's that?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.352
Lift that tarp off there.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.691
- No way.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.606
- Oh, Dave, grow a set,
would you?

01:57.576 --> 01:59.862
- Oh!
- Ooh!

01:59.995 --> 02:02.156
- I don't believe it.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.153
- It's true.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.530
- You golf.
- Indeed I do.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.327
- You're a golfer.
- I am.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.495
- [laughs]

02:07.628 --> 02:08.993
- What, you don't have
any hobbies?

02:09.129 --> 02:10.960
- Yeah, crime scenes.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.204
- Oh, sounds relaxing.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.377
- Yeah, well, they are to me.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.170
All right,
so what do we got here?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.715
Okay.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.007
Ooh.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.471
That guy
has lived a full life.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.386
He's at least 100 years old.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.682
So what, did you guys
move the body?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.850
- Yeah, I had to.
The boat was filling with water.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.223
- Pretty old to go boating.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.316
- Pretty old to even
get in a boat.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.606
All right, so did somebody
just put a tarp over it?

02:35.739 --> 02:37.195
- No, the two guys
that found the body

02:37.324 --> 02:39.064
said it was already
under the tarp.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.532
- Under the tarp?
- Yeah.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.902
- Oh, now, see?

02:43.038 --> 02:44.699
This is so much better
than golf.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.755
Well, hey.
You guys okay?

02:59.888 --> 03:01.970
- We've been better.
- Much, much better.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.714
- You guys found the body?
- We did.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.102
But he didn't look like that
when we found him.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.434
- Well, what—
what did he look like?

03:07.562 --> 03:08.938
- Old, dead.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.771
Now he looks even older,
deaden

03:13.110 --> 03:15.522
- Thought you might
find this useful.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.394
- Is that the same body?

03:17.531 --> 03:20.364
- I believe the police own
a camera or two, Vince.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.234
- Well, it can't hurt,
can it?

03:23.370 --> 03:25.406
- Can we get a statement
for the Haven Herald?

03:25.539 --> 03:26.494
- Oh, come on, guys.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.238
I've been here
less than ten minutes.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.080
Hey, can I—
can I ask you about something?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.578
Oh, or not something
but someone?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.546
- Oh, we don't think
we know him.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.415
- Hard to tell, though.
- No, no.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.713
This isn't about the body.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.928
You remember that woman
that I look like?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.136
- In the Colorado Kid pic?

03:44.266 --> 03:45.301
- Yeah.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.389
- 1984?

03:46.518 --> 03:48.383
- '3. 1983.
- Yes.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.600
Do you—

03:49.730 --> 03:52.142
do you think there's a chance
that her name could be Lucy?

03:52.274 --> 03:54.481
- Could be.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.601
- I don't remember a name
attached to the photo.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.478
- I got to get out of here.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.650
- Mai tais
are calling him home.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.444
Can we pick this up later?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.444
- Yeah, sure.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.492
- No ID on the body.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.955
They have anything else
to share?

04:11.084 --> 04:14.292
- No, but something
about this guy seems off.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.787
All right, so somebody
puts this guy in a boat

04:16.923 --> 04:18.788
and then puts a tarp
over him.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.302
The question is, when?

04:21.428 --> 04:24.761
- Well, I'd say these lobsters
have been dead three days,

04:24.890 --> 04:25.800
maybe a week.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.843
He was definitely
out for lobster.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.841
Snares, catch bag,
tickle sticks.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.684
- Tickle sticks?

04:31.813 --> 04:34.054
What, do you know that
from your private collection?

04:34.191 --> 04:36.227
- My father
has a fishing boat.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.146
Well, we should check in
with the harbormaster.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.985
If any of the local
lobster men are missing,

04:41.114 --> 04:42.024
she'll know.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.488
- Yeah, and then maybe
she can tell us

04:43.617 --> 04:44.982
why somebody this old
is still working.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.278
[baby crying]

04:46.411 --> 04:47.491
- Beattie.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.328
I didn't even know
you were expecting.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.321
- I wasn't.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.494
The adoption
just came through.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.289
Aw, this...is Benny.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.413
- Well, hi, there, Benny.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.926
Hi, Benny.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.008
Nice to meet you, Benny.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.048
- Okay, who are you, and what
have you done with my partner?

05:06.181 --> 05:08.217
- Oh, babies do that
to people.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.474
I'm Beatrice Mitchell,
harbormaster.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.559
But everybody
calls me Beattie.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.519
- Hi, I'm Audrey Parker.
It's nice to meet you.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.605
- Well, I scooped up Benny
and came right in

05:17.734 --> 05:19.349
when I heard about the body.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.067
- Can I?
- Mm-hmm.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.902
- Oh.
Oh, it's okay.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.067
[baby crying]

05:25.200 --> 05:29.318
- All right, so have you
seen anything—

05:30.664 --> 05:33.030
Have you seen anything strange
going on

05:33.166 --> 05:34.622
around the harbor
in the past week?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.083
- No, but that boat
isn't ours.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.372
I knew it
the moment I saw it.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.461
It was reported stolen
about a week ago

05:40.590 --> 05:41.875
from the Camden Harbor.

05:42.008 --> 05:42.872
- Hmm.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.170
- Well, maybe the lobster gear's
stolen too.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.713
Can you ask around?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.212
- [chuckles]

05:48.348 --> 05:49.383
- Can you, Benny?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.256
Can you ask?
- I can do that.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.054
- Okay, just—can you give her
her baby back

05:53.186 --> 05:54.392
and turn into a cop again?

05:54.521 --> 05:58.890
- Oh.
- Oh, stretchies.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.731
- Wow.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.027
- Call me if you need
any more help.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.566
- Hey.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.659
You ever seen a tattoo
like this before?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.903
- I can't say I have.
- Yeah, me either.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.620
So maybe whoever
put it on his arm

06:14.749 --> 06:16.250
can tell us
who John Doe is.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.957
- I'll make some calls.
- All right.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.417
And I'll go ahead
and check Duke's new place.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.706
There's a lot
of locals there

06:20.839 --> 06:22.420
that might be able
to tell us who he is.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.289
You want to come?

06:24.426 --> 06:26.462
- I think you can
handle that.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.926
- Okay, when are you
gonna get past

06:28.054 --> 06:29.760
this whole
"I hate Duke" thing?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.755
You know what?
Never mind.

06:31.892 --> 06:32.927
You're right.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.595
Why even talk about it?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.684
You know, it's going so well
between you two.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.434
[dramatic music]

06:43.570 --> 06:51.568
J‘J‘

07:15.310 --> 07:16.925
- Have you—

07:17.062 --> 07:18.848
Excuse me.
Have you seen this guy?

07:20.815 --> 07:23.522
Hey, have you seen this guy?
No?

07:23.652 --> 07:25.267
You? All right.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.610
Hey, have you, um...

07:33.411 --> 07:35.493
Okay, if any of you guys
have seen this man

07:35.622 --> 07:40.662
or seen anything suspicious
around the harbor...

07:40.794 --> 07:43.206
Hey!
People of the Grey Gull!

07:43.338 --> 07:45.329
If any of you
know this dude

07:45.465 --> 07:47.001
and you could come
and tell me anything,

07:47.133 --> 07:48.384
you drink free.

07:49.970 --> 07:50.880
- For a month!

07:51.012 --> 07:53.845
[cheers and applause]

07:53.974 --> 07:56.932
Your work here is done.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.470
Here you go.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.719
So what are you drinking?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.106
- I'm not drinking, actually.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.474
- Audrey, it's my
grand reopening party.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.895
Have a drink.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.188
- I really can't.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.528
Okay, just one.
That's good.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.148
- It is Friday night.
- Mm-hmm.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.024
That's true, and this
is really good, by the way.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.025
- Thank you.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.073
- But I really need
to canvass the crowd.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.242
- Would you relax
if I told you

08:20.375 --> 08:22.616
that nobody here
knows your dead guy?

08:22.752 --> 08:23.867
- Wait.
How do you know that?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.040
- People like to talk.
I like to listen.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.378
- No, what are you
talking about?

08:27.507 --> 08:32.046
- Officer Parker,
you need to clock out now.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.429
- Okay, well,
coming from a man

08:33.555 --> 08:35.045
who's never worked
a day in his life,

08:35.181 --> 08:36.466
that doesn't really mean
that much.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.215
- Oh, now, that's not
how friends talk to each other.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.183
And I feel like,
at this point,

08:41.312 --> 08:43.177
we're—we're friends.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.224
- Hmm.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.188
- And as your friend,
I worry about you.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.569
All you do is work.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.560
And it would be sad
if you realized one day

08:50.697 --> 08:51.903
that you forgot
to live your life.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.613
- Yeah, well, if I keep eating
this unhealthy,

08:53.742 --> 08:55.403
I'm not gonna have a life
to forget about.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.026
- You quit working
forjust one night,

08:58.163 --> 09:01.747
and I will cook you
a healthy, delicious dinner.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.537
- Oh, that is so sweet,
but, uh...

09:04.669 --> 09:07.081
- Next Friday night,
right here.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.874
- You plan something
in advance?

09:09.007 --> 09:10.463
Yeah, no,
that's not gonna happen.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.048
- I betcha you cancel
before I do.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.384
- Not a chance.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.252
- I can hear
the phone call now:

09:16.389 --> 09:18.095
"Oh, sorry, Duke.
I can't make it.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.135
The future of mankind
depends on me."

09:27.609 --> 09:29.850
- Excuse me.
Sorry.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.271
Okay, my experience is,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.440
the bartender knows more
than everybody else.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.188
So has this guy
ever come through here?

09:35.325 --> 09:36.610
- No. Sorry.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.279
- Great.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.617
- I'm Nora.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.735
- Oh, Audrey.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.282
Hey, listen,
if you think of anything,

09:42.415 --> 09:44.030
just give me a call,
all right?

09:44.167 --> 09:45.247
- Sure.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.632
- Now, that's appetizing.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.625
- Joe Campbell never met
a tourist he didn't like.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.674
- Don't forget:

09:59.808 --> 10:01.264
next Friday night,

10:01.392 --> 10:02.472
dinner for two.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.887
- Yeah, we'll see.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.476
- Mm-hmm.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.311
Audrey.
- Huh?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.897
- Mankind's future
is safe and sound.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.391
- Thank you.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.608
- Mm-hmm.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.820
- This is the only place
I haven't talked to.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.495
No one else recognizes
the tattoo on John Doe.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.872
I spoke to Beatrice.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.165
She said a few lobster men

10:32.298 --> 10:34.414
reported lobsters missing
from their traps.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.758
- Wait. So John Doe
could be a lobster thief?

10:36.886 --> 10:37.841
- Poacher.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.677
- Oh, poacher.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.421
- And while you were gone
at your party,

10:41.558 --> 10:43.264
I called supply shops

10:43.393 --> 10:46.351
to tie the gear on the boat
to the person who bought it.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.889
- Ah, that's a good idea.
- Yeah.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.978
No hits yet, but I thought
it was a good idea.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.473
- It might be
an even better idea

10:51.609 --> 10:52.724
if we open the search
to Camden,

10:52.861 --> 10:54.351
since the boat
was stolen from there.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.148
Thank you.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.278
Have you seen this tattoo?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.868
- Done more than seen it.
I designed it.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.329
- Did you ever tattoo this
on a guy in his 80s or 90s?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.072
- Nah, I'd remember that.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.710
- So maybe someone
stole your design?

11:09.836 --> 11:10.700
- Could happen.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.919
But there's no way
that guy got that tattoo

11:13.047 --> 11:14.503
as an old man.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.008
Once the skin begins to age,

11:16.134 --> 11:17.419
you have to ink the person

11:17.552 --> 11:20.214
with a focus
on how that skin lays.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.553
Believe me, look a hell
of a lot different

11:22.682 --> 11:23.967
if he'd gotten this
in his 80s.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.886
- So then he got it
when he was young,

11:26.019 --> 11:28.135
but that would be years
before you created it.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.725
- By the looks of it,

11:30.857 --> 11:32.142
decades before.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.730
- He wasn't old
when he got the tattoo.

11:40.867 --> 11:41.947
Judging by the bone density,

11:42.076 --> 11:44.453
John Doe was in his 30s
when he died.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.444
- And he died of...
- Old age.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.536
- Huh.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.530
Is it possible
that that extreme type of aging

11:49.667 --> 11:51.623
could happen
during decomposition?

11:51.753 --> 11:52.788
- Don't see how.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.786
Blast it! Dagnabbit!

11:54.923 --> 11:56.379
Decomp takes
six months to a year,

11:56.507 --> 11:57.917
depending on the environment.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.258
- And in the case
of John Doe?

12:00.386 --> 12:01.296
- [grunting]
Maybe a week.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.418
Aghl

12:02.555 --> 12:04.716
Careful, Henry,
Or I'm comin' over there.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.098
- How do you know
it's just a week?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.309
- Oh, the flesh
was completely deteriorated,

12:09.437 --> 12:11.177
but the insects
that speed the process along

12:11.314 --> 12:12.394
were far too immature.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.941
Henry's throwing
wicked balls today.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.435
Maybe if I had
a little space.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.812
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.110
Is there anything that could
have sped up the decomposition,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.279
like some sort of drug
or a poison?

12:25.411 --> 12:29.279
- Tox screen was clean.
No, there isn't.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.700
Quit jammin' me, Henry.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.824
John Doe didn't just start
rapidly decomposing.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.794
He—he was aging at that rate
while he was still alive.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.787
- Is there anything that can
explain that kind of aging?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.415
- No, there isn't.
But this is Haven, isn't it?

12:41.552 --> 12:43.679
- Dr. Carr.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.592
The hospital
said you were here.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.931
[grunts]

12:50.103 --> 12:51.593
- What the hell?

12:55.066 --> 12:57.478
- Doc, you got to help me.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.360
- He's dying.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.351
- You know him?
- No.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.444
- I need an EMT
at the tennis courts.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.154
- Joe Campbell.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.195
- Campbell?
I went to high school with him.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.567
This guy looks like he's 80.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.535
- Yeah, I saw him at
the Grey Gull on Friday night,

13:09.664 --> 13:12.121
and he was 30,
35, tops.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.017
- Well, Bangor confirms it.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.682
Both John Doe
and Joe Campbell

13:34.814 --> 13:36.315
died the same exact way:

13:36.441 --> 13:38.853
rapidly aging
and rapidly decomposing.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.475
- You sure
you saw Campbell here?

13:40.611 --> 13:42.147
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure,
and from what I saw,

13:42.280 --> 13:44.566
he was feeling pretty good
and about to feel even better.

13:44.699 --> 13:45.859
- Haven's finest.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.404
- We're looking into the death
of Joe Campbell.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.653
- Yeah, I heard about that.
Some nasty stuff.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.290
- Do you remember the woman
that he was making out with

13:53.416 --> 13:54.701
at the bar on Friday night?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.995
- I think it's very sweet
that you still say "making out."

13:58.338 --> 13:59.498
Sorry I can't be
more helpful.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.542
I only saw the back of her.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.211
Joe did have a thing
for tourists, though.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.880
- Anyone in particular?

14:06.012 --> 14:07.047
- Ones he wasn't married to.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.716
Guess that's why
he's not married anymore.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.179
- All right,
is Nora working today?

14:10.308 --> 14:11.343
- Yeah.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.216
Hey, we, uh, still on?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.014
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.223
- Don't you work it too hard,
now, Officer Wuornos.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.272
'Cause I heard
that being a cop

14:23.404 --> 14:25.520
can destroy all evidence
of having a personality.

14:27.241 --> 14:30.074
Just...suck it
right out of you.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.909
- He left with that chick.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.403
She was practically
assaulting him,

14:33.539 --> 14:35.075
but he didn't seem
to mind too much.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.539
- She have a name?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.409
- I think I heard her tell him
it was Helena or Elena.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.580
It was loud in here.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.919
- Did you catch a last name?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.629
Maybe she paid
with a credit card?

14:43.758 --> 14:46.215
- A girl like that has never
paid for a drink in her life.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.255
Doesn't even
reach for her purse,

14:48.388 --> 14:49.798
not even a courtesy grab.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.387
- Pretty?
- Not pretty.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.426
Beautiful.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.640
Long hair that she
doesn't color at home.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.758
You know what I'm saying.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.305
- Yeah, I do.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.144
We need to get
a sketch artist.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.888
- I could get a guy down
from Portland.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.981
Take a couple of days.
- Days?

15:03.111 --> 15:05.227
- Or we could use
a local guy I know.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.945
Not exactly a pro,
but he's good.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.655
- Yeah, let's do that.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.399
- Cross two celebrities.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.276
- Like Mariah Carey
meets Barbra Streisand.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.949
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay, sure.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.946
But a smaller nose
than Barbra

15:17.083 --> 15:19.415
and maybe more like
Penelope Cruz.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.250
- From Carlito's Way?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.290
- From every movie
except that one.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.959
- Oh.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.252
Smaller nose
than Barbra Streisand.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.627
- Mm-hmm.
- Bigger than Penelope Cruz.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.094
Like that?

15:32.223 --> 15:33.133
- Is that a beret?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.006
- That's a Hermes scarf,
Nathan.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.804
You said
she looked European.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.346
- Okay, lose the scarf.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.266
But yeah, that—
that looks a lot like her.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.605
- Oh.
[chuckles]

15:42.733 --> 15:43.643
- He's very good, isn't he?

15:43.776 --> 15:44.891
' [giggles]
Yeah.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.608
Huh?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.855
- Got a couple of hits
on Joe Campbell.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.825
One for petty larceny,
another for poaching.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.033
Out of Portland.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.154
- Like John Doe.
- Mm-hmm.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.372
- All right, so maybe Helena
has issues with poachers.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.333
- Well, every lobster man
has issues with poachers.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.872
- That's true,
but none of them

16:04.005 --> 16:06.121
took Joe Campbell home
the other night.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.132
- This Helena was wandering
around the harbor.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.633
I thought you might
know about it.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.976
- Normally, yeah,
but I've never seen her before.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.518
Think she might have something
to do with your John Doe?

16:24.650 --> 16:25.605
- Well, we don't know yet.

16:25.735 --> 16:26.645
We just know that she was

16:26.777 --> 16:29.359
the last person seen
with Joe Campbell.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.354
- Joe—Joe Campbell?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.322
- Yeah, he died the same way
as John Doe.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.737
- Oh, I hadn't
heard about Joe.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.531
He was a loser

16:37.663 --> 16:38.823
but a gentle loser.

16:38.956 --> 16:39.866
[door clicks open]

16:39.999 --> 16:40.954
- Beatrice, l—

16:41.083 --> 16:43.244
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.868
I didn't realize
you had company.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.587
- This is my nanny, Abby.
- Hi.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.172
- So you ended up
finding some help?

16:50.301 --> 16:52.041
- I came all the way out
from Nebraska

16:52.178 --> 16:53.714
to help out with the baby.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.303
I've been friends with Beattie's
family for a long time.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.219
- Abby has been a blessing.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.217
I wouldn't leave Benny
with just anyone.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.719
- Pink blanket?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.720
You're gonna confuse
little Benny here.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.563
- Hand-me-downs.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.683
The adoption came through
so quickly.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.070
- Mm! Mm! Mm!

17:10.196 --> 17:12.403
Now I know what to get you
for a baby gift.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.773
- Okay, seriously, can you stop?
You're freaking me out.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.616
[cell phone ringing]

17:20.748 --> 17:21.988
- Wuornos.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.251
- The car's loaded up.
I'm ready whenever you are.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.743
- Oh, are you going somewhere?
- Maternity leave.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.460
Life first,
work second, right?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.500
- Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.839
Hey, it was nice
to meet you, Abby.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.674
- Mm-hmm.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.758
Beattie, what is it?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.506
- They know about Helena.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.758
- How much do they know?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.601
- They know
she's been in Haven.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.640
But they don't know
when she's coming back.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.527
- Bait shop in Camden
sold the same supplies

17:53.656 --> 17:56.318
we found on John Doe's boat
to two men in their 30s.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.532
One of 'em had short hair
like John Doe.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.868
Store owner identified him
as Phil Reiser.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.783
- Great.
Did he ID the other guy?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.780
- No, all he could say was,
he was average height,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.657
average build,
drives a green pickup.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.126
The two of them come in
every Friday, always pay cash.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.371
- You think green pickup guy
is gonna stick to schedule

18:11.507 --> 18:12.667
now that his partner's dead?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.040
- Wouldn't be
the smartest play,

18:14.176 --> 18:16.792
but they special ordered
a new outboard engine.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.885
Prepaid.
Guy expects it in on Friday.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.596
- How much does an engine
like that cost?

18:20.725 --> 18:21.635
- $7,500.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.803
- Oh, that kind of money will
make people do stupid things.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.846
- Almost always.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.469
- Looks like we're going
to Camden on Friday.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.595
- Yup.

18:30.651 --> 18:35.111
-J‘ Oh, oh, oh J‘

18:35.239 --> 18:39.608
J‘ Oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh J‘

18:39.744 --> 18:43.987
J‘ Oh, oh, oh J‘

18:44.123 --> 18:47.160
J‘ Oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh J‘

18:47.293 --> 18:50.660
- This is the part
I really hate about stakeouts

18:50.796 --> 18:55.290
is when your legs
stop working.

18:55.426 --> 18:56.415
- Tell me about it.

18:56.552 --> 19:00.511
[cell phone rings]

19:00.640 --> 19:01.755
- Oh, hey, Duke.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.428
- On the menu this evening
is a grilled tiger shrimp

19:04.560 --> 19:05.845
marinated in coconut.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.263
Just came in this morning.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.682
- Dinner Friday night, right.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.306
Shrimp, that's—
that's actually my favorite.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.150
- Oh, don't even think
about canceling on me, woman.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.326
- You know, I'm—
I'm really sorry.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.033
I don't think
I'm gonna be able to go.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.494
- Let me guess:
you are working.

19:25.623 --> 19:26.533
Am I right?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.202
- Maybe.
- Mm-hmm.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.663
- Parker.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.374
- Okay, I got to go.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.294
- Yeah, better go
save the world, Officer Parker.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.212
Hey.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.835
I told you
I'd win the bet.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.349
- Hey!

19:50.648 --> 19:52.058
Please,

19:52.191 --> 19:53.522
don't make me chase you.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.278
- James Wardel,
wanted in connection

19:59.407 --> 20:02.114
with grand theft auto
and poaching.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.076
Roommates with Phil Reiser,

20:05.204 --> 20:06.910
who had what in his boat
when we found him dead?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.575
- I believe
it was poaching gear.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.323
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.995
- Yeah, of course you don't.

20:12.128 --> 20:16.246
James what can you tell me
about this woman?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.087
You know her.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.299
- Helena.

20:21.429 --> 20:22.589
- Helena...

20:22.722 --> 20:24.758
- I didn't get a last name.

20:24.890 --> 20:28.098
Phil was with her
Friday night.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.216
She was intense.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.809
- And when did Phil
start getting sick?

20:30.938 --> 20:31.893
- Saturday.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.855
We were supposed
to go out...

20:34.984 --> 20:35.939
fishing.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.150
- Poaching.
- Poaching.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.485
- But Phil said
he was too sore.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.945
And then...

20:42.074 --> 20:43.814
he got...

20:46.412 --> 20:47.868
He got old.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.204
I mean, it was like the life
just drained right out of him.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.833
- Why didn't you take him
to the hospital?

20:51.959 --> 20:54.120
- I wanted to,
but he had outstanding warrants.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.460
I put him on the boat,
but I didn't kill him.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.624
- This was in Camden?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.293
- Haven, not Camden.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.962
We ran into Helena
in front of the Gull.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.131
- So Helena was at the Grey Gull
the past two Fridays.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.471
And it's Friday.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.989
- Am I too early for dinner?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.127
- Right on time.

[grunts]
Okay.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.094
Ladies.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.717
- Duke.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.264
- Help you with anything?

22:36.397 --> 22:38.604
- No, Abby and I are just
looking for a friend.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.393
- Cheers.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.687
[sighs]

22:42.820 --> 22:46.404
- No one saw Helena
at the Gull last night.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.614
- Well, maybe Helena's
a fisherman

22:48.742 --> 22:50.949
out to kill poachers.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.409
[cell phone buzzes]

22:52.538 --> 22:54.403
Never mind.
- Yeah.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.532
A smokin'-hot,
poacher-killing fisherman.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.624
- I said never mind.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.459
- All right,
every connection we have

23:01.589 --> 23:02.704
comes back to this harbor.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.626
And the only similarity
between the two victims

23:04.758 --> 23:05.884
is their jobs and—

23:06.010 --> 23:07.750
- Where they met Helena

23:07.887 --> 23:09.252
and how they died.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.629
- Okay, we need to check
state records

23:11.765 --> 23:14.142
just to see if there's
any similar deaths.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.345
- Got somethin'.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.314
Coroner's report
has a similar case in Derry.

23:22.443 --> 23:25.185
A 40-year-old man
was reported missing.

23:25.321 --> 23:28.279
He died three days later
as an old man.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.271
- How did we miss that?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.114
- Case is from 1954.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.154
- Ah, okay, well,
that makes me feel better.

23:33.287 --> 23:34.493
Do we have any suspects?

23:34.622 --> 23:36.283
- Why would there be
any suspects?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.280
He died of old age.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.282
- Point taken.

23:40.419 --> 23:44.082
- But a woman named

23:44.214 --> 23:46.751
Alexandra Leidner
found the body.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.795
[cell phone buzzes]

23:48.928 --> 23:51.169
- Well, this might
be a long shot, but...

23:51.305 --> 23:52.294
maybe she knows something.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.467
Is she still alive?

23:54.600 --> 23:55.464
- No.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.638
Alexandra Leidner,
born 1925.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.478
Died during childbirth
in 1954,

24:01.607 --> 24:05.896
one week after the death
of the man in Derry.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.564
- Big coincidence.

24:07.696 --> 24:08.981
- Yeah.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.526
[cell phone buzzes]

24:11.659 --> 24:13.820
- Duke does not like
to be canceled on.

24:13.953 --> 24:14.942
Hello?

24:19.166 --> 24:21.452
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll be right there.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.493
Helena was at the Grey Gull
on Friday.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.494
- What?

24:25.631 --> 24:27.622
- She just never
made it inside.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.266
- I got to tell you,

24:39.395 --> 24:42.979
your emergency response time
leaves something to be desired.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.101
Crap.

24:51.699 --> 24:54.816
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

24:54.952 --> 24:56.658
- Duke, when I couldn't
make our dinner,

24:56.787 --> 24:59.369
you met up with somebody else,
didn't you?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.581
- Audrey, if you want to put
work first in this situation,

25:02.710 --> 25:05.247
I'm—I'm fine with that.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.370
- Helena.
Did you sleep with her?

25:07.506 --> 25:08.871
- What's that got to do
with anything?

25:09.008 --> 25:11.374
- All right, there's just
no easy way to say this.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.047
This woman has been sleeping
with men every Friday night

25:14.179 --> 25:16.090
and somehow...

25:16.223 --> 25:17.633
aging them.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.757
- Oh.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.679
- To death.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.732
- And here I thought
I was in real trouble.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.518
- I'm sorry.
You are.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.894
- [scoffs]

25:32.031 --> 25:34.613
Can we stop this?

25:34.742 --> 25:35.902
Whatever this is.

25:36.035 --> 25:36.945
- We need to find Helena,

25:37.077 --> 25:39.284
so you can start by telling me
everything you know about her.

25:39.413 --> 25:42.075
- Everything?

25:42.207 --> 25:43.538
- Broad strokes.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.502
- She found me
outside the Gull.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.042
I invited her to dinner
after...

25:51.175 --> 25:53.416
somebody stood me up.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.043
But she only had one thing
on her mind.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.341
And as a general rule,
I don't...

25:58.474 --> 26:01.090
turn down beautiful women
with an appetite.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.932
- You went home with her,
just like that?

26:03.062 --> 26:05.348
- No, Nathan, first I passed her
a note in study hall.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.141
Look, the truth is,

26:10.277 --> 26:12.609
I probably would have
said yes anyways.

26:12.738 --> 26:16.651
But with Helena,

26:16.784 --> 26:19.196
I had no control.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.242
I can't explain it.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.289
It's like she hypnotized me.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.006
- We need to get him
to the hospital.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.466
- Great idea, Nathan.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.132
Which department handles
life-draining women?

26:39.264 --> 26:40.845
Hmm?

26:40.974 --> 26:43.556
Exactly.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.643
I'm not going to a hospital.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.308
You know,
this little quandary

26:48.440 --> 26:49.896
has "freak factor"
written all over it,

26:50.025 --> 26:52.311
so I think I'm gonna stick
with you and...

26:52.444 --> 26:53.524
Scooby here.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.191
- Did Helena say anything
that might tell us

26:56.323 --> 26:58.314
who she is
or where she's from?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.031
- We didn't do
a whole lot of talking.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.115
- Okay, is there anything

27:01.245 --> 27:02.655
from waking up
that you remember?

27:02.788 --> 27:03.823
- She was gone.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.321
- Did you see anything

27:05.457 --> 27:07.539
or anyone
out of the ordinary?

27:07.668 --> 27:08.999
Last night, this morning,

27:09.128 --> 27:11.494
at the docks,
around your boat—anything.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.336
- No, the last person
I spoke to

27:13.465 --> 27:15.330
before I went to lie down
was Beatrice.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.128
- Beatrice the harbormaster?

27:17.261 --> 27:18.751
Wasn't she on maternity leave?

27:18.887 --> 27:21.970
- She was at the docks
with that elderly woman Abby.

27:22.099 --> 27:24.806
They were...

27:24.935 --> 27:26.266
looking for someone.

27:26.395 --> 27:27.430
- Helena.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.099
- I think we need
to ask her that.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.768
Does Beatrice still live
on Little Bay Road?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.276
- Contrary to popular belief,

27:33.402 --> 27:35.859
I don't know where every woman
in Haven lives, Nathan.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.194
- Okay.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.525
- [grunts]
Okay.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.194
- No, where are you going?

27:41.326 --> 27:42.862
You need to stay here
and rest.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.531
- You mean stay here and die.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.076
Yeah, I don't think so.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.384
- You okay?

28:06.518 --> 28:07.598
You need a hand?

28:07.728 --> 28:10.640
- When you're nice to me,
it reminds me that I'm dying.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.603
- Well, hurry the hell up, then.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.144
- Thank you.

28:20.282 --> 28:23.149
- Are you going somewhere?

28:23.285 --> 28:25.071
You're protecting Helena,
aren't you?

28:26.705 --> 28:28.241
Where is she?

28:28.373 --> 28:30.364
- It's too late.
You can't stop her.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.826
- You know what?
Excuse me.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.886
- I thought Beatrice
adopted one child.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.015
- Hey.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.263
Helena was wearing
that purple dress.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.236
- She was wearing this
when I saw her.

29:05.786 --> 29:07.242
Beatrice.

29:08.497 --> 29:11.113
- "Beatrice Leidner Mitchell."

29:12.501 --> 29:15.208
- Is that any relation
to Alexandra Leidner?

29:16.630 --> 29:19.292
This man is going to die.
I need to know.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.756
- Beatrice is Alexandra's
granddaughter.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.625
But there's nothing
you can do.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.378
- What the hell
does that mean?

29:27.975 --> 29:30.933
- Two dead men,
two children.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.813
Beatrice isn't covering
for Helena.

29:33.939 --> 29:34.974
- No.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.472
- That's because

29:36.608 --> 29:39.145
Beatrice is Helena.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.689
Okay, where's Beatrice?

29:45.826 --> 29:47.157
Helena, whoever she is.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.992
- The lighthouse.
It's private.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.658
Beatrice goes there
when it's Helena's time.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.326
- You, you're coming with us.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.173
Hey, Beatrice?

30:11.310 --> 30:12.299
We have Abby here with us.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.801
We know you're in there.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.515
Beatrice!

30:16.648 --> 30:18.684
I need you
to open the door now!

30:20.861 --> 30:22.817
Hey, that's another way to go.

30:32.122 --> 30:33.328
Oh, my God.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.459
- Those babies can't be
more than a week old.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.450
- Three babies
in three weeks?

30:38.587 --> 30:40.043
- Oh.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.037
- I thought you were taking
the life from these men,

30:42.174 --> 30:43.505
but it's—

30:43.633 --> 30:45.419
it's the babies
that are doing that, isn't it?

30:45.552 --> 30:48.009
- I'm so sorry.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.097
- Didn't you know
your family's history?

30:52.225 --> 30:54.386
- Oh, I thought
I could control it,

30:54.519 --> 30:57.226
but I can't control anything
that Helena does.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.063
- Well...

31:00.192 --> 31:03.559
that, as they say,
is that.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.686
- [groans]

31:09.576 --> 31:11.737
- We need to stop her
from delivering this baby.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.280
- Oh.
[liquid splatters]

31:13.413 --> 31:14.493
- Well, it's too late
for that.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.739
This baby's comin'.
- Give me room!

31:16.875 --> 31:19.366
- Oh.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.039
[groans]

31:29.054 --> 31:32.717
- [rasping]

31:32.849 --> 31:35.101
[hoarsely]
I need to rest.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.219
[laughing]

31:41.233 --> 31:44.646
You know, when I woke up
this morning,

31:44.778 --> 31:48.441
I didn't think today
was gonna be the day.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.158
Ah, you know what I mean.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.743
[Beatrice moaning]

31:58.458 --> 32:00.323
- It's not over yet.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.124
- I'm sorry.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.213
I didn't know
what Helena was doing,

32:07.342 --> 32:08.331
not at first.

32:08.468 --> 32:09.628
- She knows that, honey.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.262
- I need you to help me
figure this out,

32:11.388 --> 32:12.468
okay, Beatrice?

32:12.597 --> 32:13.712
- Now?
- Yes, now!

32:13.849 --> 32:16.465
If we don't,
Duke will die.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.681
- Okay.

32:17.811 --> 32:20.803
- Okay, now, just—
just start at the beginning.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.930
- A few weeks ago,

32:23.066 --> 32:26.183
I ran into my ex-husband.

32:26.319 --> 32:29.982
I spent the next four days
locked in my room.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.104
- Why?

32:31.241 --> 32:33.482
- He talked
about his new family,

32:33.618 --> 32:35.483
the little girl
that he just had.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.703
We'd lost a baby,
and it tore us apart.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.619
After that, ljust
couldn't get out of bed,

32:41.751 --> 32:43.207
until...

32:43.336 --> 32:44.667
- Until you became Helena.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.663
- She went out
and met that poor guy Phil.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.380
When Helena was in charge,

32:49.509 --> 32:50.840
all those feelings
were gone.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.675
- And then you would wake up
in the morning and—

32:52.804 --> 32:53.884
and be pregnant.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.220
- The doctors

32:55.348 --> 32:58.966
said that I would never
carry a baby again.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.559
And then when I saw Phil
dead on the dock—

33:01.688 --> 33:03.849
- That's when you recognized
the tattoo

33:03.982 --> 33:06.394
and you realized
what Helena was doing?

33:06.526 --> 33:08.187
- [gasping]

33:08.320 --> 33:10.026
- Okay, how—
how do we stop this?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.361
- You can't!

33:11.490 --> 33:13.196
- Well, how did you stop
her grandmother?

33:13.325 --> 33:16.112
- I didn't.
She died in childbirth.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.405
[Beatrice moaning]

33:23.668 --> 33:25.044
- [rasping]

33:25.170 --> 33:26.580
- Come on, man.
Stay with me.

33:26.713 --> 33:29.455
- Do you really hate me?

33:29.591 --> 33:33.049
- Hate's a strong word.

33:33.178 --> 33:36.170
- [wheezing]

33:39.643 --> 33:41.179
I'm dying.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.019
I can feel it.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.815
Generally,
I liked being alone.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.818
But I didn't want
to die that way.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.189
- You're not gonna die today.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.702
When you die, it's gonna be
'cause I killed you myself.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.412
- The contractions
are coming too close.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.160
This baby is coming,
like it or not!

34:08.296 --> 34:10.207
- Okay, have you ever delivered
a baby in the family

34:10.340 --> 34:11.580
where the father didn't die?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.092
- Never.

34:13.218 --> 34:16.551
- [screams]

34:18.473 --> 34:20.338
Oh!
- Okay.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.885
- [breathing heavily]

34:22.018 --> 34:23.474
- Okay, Beatrice,
I know this is hard,

34:23.603 --> 34:25.139
but I still need
more answers.

34:25.272 --> 34:26.603
- [moaning]
I'll try.

34:26.731 --> 34:30.349
- So you or Helena slept
with the men on Friday night?

34:30.485 --> 34:31.850
- The babies come on a Sunday,

34:31.987 --> 34:34.273
and the men died
on the same day.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.112
- Okay, well, Joe Campbell
didn't die on Sunday.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.447
He died on a Monday.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.441
Was there something different
with the second birth?

34:39.578 --> 34:40.613
- There was problems
with the delivery.

34:40.745 --> 34:43.122
- What kind of problem?
- The baby was in distress.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.409
We had to put him
under a warmer for a day

34:45.542 --> 34:46.657
until he got better.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.909
- Okay, well, Joe Campbell
died Monday afternoon.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.660
Did something happen then?

34:50.797 --> 34:53.459
- That's when Abby
finally let me hold my baby.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.924
[whimpering]

34:56.052 --> 34:57.633
- Okay.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.629
So you held the baby,
and—and Joe died.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.683
- Please.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.644
Please don't let me
lose another baby.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.435
- Helena already took
two men's lives, Beatrice.

35:11.568 --> 35:14.355
And you have the chance
to save one.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.772
Will you do that?

35:19.868 --> 35:22.701
- [screams]

35:22.829 --> 35:27.949
- [groaning]

35:28.084 --> 35:29.665
- Duke!

35:29.794 --> 35:30.909
Duke!

35:33.965 --> 35:35.830
- [gasping]

35:35.967 --> 35:37.047
- Duke!

35:37.177 --> 35:39.634
[Beatrice screams]

35:44.851 --> 35:46.057
[baby whimpers]

35:46.186 --> 35:48.177
- [laughs]

35:48.313 --> 35:50.224
[baby whimpering]

35:50.357 --> 35:52.222
- Oh.

35:52.359 --> 35:53.269
- Give her to me.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.686
Maybe if the father
holds the baby,

35:54.819 --> 35:55.808
it'll reverse the aging.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.062
Now, I know that I'm basically
just winging it,

35:59.199 --> 36:01.030
but can you
give her to me now?

36:09.793 --> 36:11.658
[baby whimpers]

36:13.129 --> 36:14.869
All right.
- He's barely breathing.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.964
- Okay. Here.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.333
- [groans]

36:20.512 --> 36:21.422
- Did you see that?

36:21.554 --> 36:22.885
- The baby makes him sick.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.299
They can't
be near each other.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.717
- Okay.

36:25.850 --> 36:29.342
All right.
All right.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.810
- Duke, hang on.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.101
- What are we gonna do
with you?

36:34.234 --> 36:37.226
[siren wailing]

36:40.281 --> 36:41.407
So hoW's Duke?

36:41.533 --> 36:42.898
- He's getting better
every minute.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.194
- But he doesn't seem
to remember

36:44.327 --> 36:45.407
what happened to him.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.572
- He'll be fine,

36:46.705 --> 36:49.742
as long as we keep
baby Jean away from him.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.957
- That's unbelievable.
- Mm-hmm.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.122
[camera clicks]

36:55.255 --> 36:56.745
- And Beatrice?

36:56.881 --> 36:59.213
- She's trying to concentrate
on the two babies she has.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.924
She couldn't bear
to watch Jean go away.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.544
- Yeah, I don't think Nathan
will be able to either.

37:04.681 --> 37:05.761
- [chuckles]

37:05.890 --> 37:07.050
- [laughs]

37:11.688 --> 37:13.019
- Between our agency and Abby,

37:13.148 --> 37:15.935
we'll find her a good home.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.112
- Thanks again.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.785
- Think we should tell Duke
about the baby?

37:33.918 --> 37:34.828
- I don't know.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.201
You know,
there's not a rule book

37:36.337 --> 37:39.249
for this kind of thing.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.089
- He's not exactly
father material.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.755
- But apparently you are.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.298
You know,
there's a maternity ward

37:46.431 --> 37:47.341
on the way home.

37:47.474 --> 37:48.634
We could stop off
if you want.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.883
There's probably a lot
of cuties there.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.656
Oh, a little gray
looks good in your hair.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.624
Just a little.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.243
- I'm glad that you like it,

38:18.379 --> 38:22.042
but...seems to be
going away.

38:23.009 --> 38:23.919
- How are you feeling?

38:24.052 --> 38:25.963
- It's been interesting.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.505
But I'm, uh...

38:27.639 --> 38:29.925
on the mend.

38:30.058 --> 38:33.266
- Hey, do you remember
Beatrice's baby being born?

38:33.394 --> 38:36.136
- Of course.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.854
- That's your baby.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.521
- [laughs]

38:42.654 --> 38:44.986
That”

38:46.699 --> 38:48.860
How is that possible?

38:48.993 --> 38:50.608
- How is any of this possible?

38:55.750 --> 38:58.537
- You're saying
that I have a—

38:58.670 --> 39:00.376
a $0” or...

39:00.505 --> 39:01.665
- A daughter.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.749
Her name is Jean.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.721
But, uh...

39:15.854 --> 39:18.641
you can never see her,

39:18.773 --> 39:22.311
'cause she's
what made you so sick.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.311
Abby's actually found
a really good family for her

39:26.447 --> 39:27.653
in Nebraska.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.903
- That's good.

39:33.788 --> 39:34.903
- Are you gonna be okay?

39:37.584 --> 39:38.539
-Uh...

39:38.668 --> 39:41.501
I mean, uh...

39:41.629 --> 39:44.041
you can't miss
what you never had.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.794
Thank you for—
for taking that for me.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.508
- Actually, I took it for her.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.252
I took it for Jean.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.629
You know,
I don't have any pictures

39:52.765 --> 39:54.266
of the first day
that I was in this world,

39:54.392 --> 39:57.225
so I wanted her
to have it.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.228
- That's nice.

40:01.608 --> 40:04.350
You know, I think
I'm just gonna go...

40:04.485 --> 40:05.645
check on the food.
