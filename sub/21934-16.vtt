WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.571
Previously on Scorpion...
Hey, Patty. I made
this for you.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.739
Cool. Thanks, kiddo.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.142
I want a family.
I've always wanted a family

00:08.176 --> 00:12.780
and I want one with you
'cause I love you.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.715
Shall we start now?

00:14.748 --> 00:17.785
So, I saw you talking
to Flo earlier.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.620
You glad I convinced you
to keep her around?

00:19.653 --> 00:21.689
Yes. I have to admit,
the reason why

00:21.722 --> 00:22.590
I didn't want her to
come was, uh, childish.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.825
What was that?
It's very silly, actually.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.194
I-I dreamt we were married

00:26.227 --> 00:27.428
and we kissed.
What?

00:28.829 --> 00:32.200
♪ When you're with me

00:32.233 --> 00:34.535
♪ My mind can rest.

00:34.568 --> 00:38.038
One thing's for sure,
I am not a musician.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.552
Oh. Hey, guys.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.087
You're back.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.422
How'd it go at Elia's
new factory?

00:54.455 --> 00:56.224
Well, the software installation
was successful.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.558
SYLVESTER: And by
successful, he means

00:57.591 --> 01:00.494
no one was launched into
space or taken hostage.

01:00.528 --> 01:04.532
And Elia was pleasantly
surprised and we got paid.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.700
I also got a check in the mail
from the UCLA job.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.702
Plus, money back
from Cabe's bail,

01:08.736 --> 01:10.571
which means we have enough
to cover the overdue bills

01:10.604 --> 01:12.573
and still be in the black
for the first time in months.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.642
(wind rushing)
Listen to those Santa Ana winds.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.277
SYLVESTER:
Reports are saying

01:16.310 --> 01:18.579
they are the strongest
ever for February.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.381
Oh. It's just you guys.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.716
Uh, he's expecting Patty.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.651
Why would Patty be coming over?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.519
We don't have any
alderman business today.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.555
She e-mailed and said
she wanted to talk to me

01:27.588 --> 01:29.423
about her school's
Sadie Hawkins Day dance.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.691
What's that?

01:30.724 --> 01:33.594
It's a dance where the girls
invite the boys.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.429
So instead of being
rejected to our faces,

01:35.463 --> 01:37.431
nerds are merely ignored.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.699
Refreshing change of pace,
actually.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.800
WALTER:
So, Patty is

01:39.833 --> 01:41.402
coming over to ask you

01:41.435 --> 01:42.736
to a dance?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.672
Well done, young squire.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.708
I'm gonna comb my hair again.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.810
(sighs)

01:49.843 --> 01:50.911
Are you okay with this?

01:50.944 --> 01:51.979
Reserving judgment.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.348
Why didn't Happy and Toby
come back with you guys?

01:54.382 --> 01:55.716
They did, but the wind blew
Toby's hat off

01:55.749 --> 01:57.751
when he exited her truck.
Fourth time today.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.852
WALTER:
And Happy is helping him

01:58.886 --> 02:00.354
get it out of a tree.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.555
Also fourth time today.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.191
Can I please just have
my hat back?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.358
Speak of the devil.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.626
Only if I can staple
it to your head.

02:05.659 --> 02:06.760
TOBY:
That is uncalled for.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.895
No, what's uncalled for

02:07.928 --> 02:10.498
is wearing a fedora
365 days a year.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.533
Is it me or is she just
crankier than usual?

02:12.566 --> 02:16.204
They had tests to determine
if there's a medical reason

02:16.237 --> 02:17.171
why Happy isn't pregnant yet.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.406
They've been expecting
the results all day.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.475
You must be really stressed

02:21.509 --> 02:23.477
because we both know

02:23.511 --> 02:25.913
that this hat makes me
look foxy.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.648
I know.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.783
Just relax. It's gonna be fine.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.952
Okay, you keep saying that,

02:31.985 --> 02:34.922
but we still haven't heard from
the doctors and it is past 5:30.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.790
Bad sign, right?
Mm-mm.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.559
I'm sure the lab results
are in the system

02:38.592 --> 02:40.761
and the doctor just hasn't
had a chance to review them.

02:40.794 --> 02:44.265
This happens all the time.
No big deal.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.702
I can't shake the feeling that
something is wrong with me.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.737
Hey, look at me.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.640
You're perfect.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.442
There's nothing wrong with you.
I promise.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.210
(sighs)

02:58.011 --> 03:00.414
(sighs)

03:00.448 --> 03:03.351
Hell of a way to spend
Valentine's Day.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.722
Walter.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.924
These are for you.

03:11.992 --> 03:12.960
Sweet "Ring Around the Rosie."

03:12.993 --> 03:13.961
I don't know what to say.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.429
Say that you will get

03:15.463 --> 03:18.299
your address numbers
over your door repainted.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.367
These were delivered to me

03:19.400 --> 03:20.434
by mistake.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.435
Paige's name is on the card.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.936
I'm giving them to you

03:22.970 --> 03:24.372
so that you can
give them to her

03:24.405 --> 03:27.341
as my presenting them
would be confusing.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.644
I'll be going now.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.648
Was that Patty?

03:34.682 --> 03:36.650
Florence.
Ah, damn it.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.718
Language.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.719
For you, my Valentine.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.489
Walter, they're beautiful.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.324
The olfactory component's
quite satisfying.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.425
Go ahead. Sniff.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.760
Okay.
(sniffs)

03:48.629 --> 03:50.298
(sneezes)

03:50.331 --> 03:51.632
Do you have allergies to roses?

03:51.665 --> 03:52.633
No.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.468
You don't like the candy
I gave you this morning?

03:54.502 --> 03:56.504
It's unopened.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.805
No, I love it.

03:57.838 --> 03:58.806
Oh, okay.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.674
Walter, look.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.244
(chuckles)

04:08.749 --> 04:10.451
Sneezing, nausea,
you've got the flu.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.653
TOBY: Paige,
you got the flu.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.887
Thought you ducked the job today

04:13.921 --> 04:15.589
because things with Elia
always go sideways.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.024
No, I didn't duck anything.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.892
It was simple IT work
and with Cabe at Homeland,

04:18.926 --> 04:19.893
I thought I'd take advantage
of the quiet

04:19.927 --> 04:21.362
and work on the books.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.299
Oh. (sneezes)

04:27.335 --> 04:28.702
Fine. I'm sick.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.371
I'd hoped if I'd stayed in

04:30.404 --> 04:32.039
I'd feel up for having
Valentine's dinner tonight.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.641
Oh, don't worry
about the date.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.376
We'll just get you
upstairs and rest.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.044
I concur. Doctor's orders.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.547
What? Off you go.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.456
No, Patty.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.557
This garage is infected
with influenza

04:49.590 --> 04:52.493
and I cannot risk my intern
getting sick. Skedaddle.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.927
Relax, I've had my flu shot

04:53.961 --> 04:55.929
and I have a fantastic
immune system.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.498
My entire school career

04:57.531 --> 04:58.766
I have only missed three days.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.933
Oh, here it comes.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.369
And I've never had a tardy.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.403
Where's Ralph?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.907
Hey.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.909
Here I am.
Hey, Patty.

05:08.942 --> 05:09.710
Way to play it cool.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.813
Uh, some place
we can talk privately?

05:12.846 --> 05:15.783
Uh, Sly's office.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.685
Perfect.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.427
Uh, Ralph, sweetie, will you
bring Mommy more tissues?

05:26.460 --> 05:30.564
Ralph is busy, but have no fear,
Walter's here with tissues

05:30.598 --> 05:32.566
and mentho-lyptus rub
and vegetable elixir

05:32.600 --> 05:34.402
full of vitamins
to put you on the mend.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.836
Oh, thank you.
Quick warning, though.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.606
The elixir, don't be concerned
if it turns your urine red

05:38.639 --> 05:39.873
'cause it-it will.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.475
Mm.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.079
(gags)

05:46.113 --> 05:47.981
That's terrible.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.717
Yeah, it's got radishes
for magnesium,

05:49.750 --> 05:52.152
beets for manganese and
ginger root for your nausea.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.087
Now, you just relax

05:54.121 --> 05:56.089
and prepare yourself
for more Valentine's treats.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.559
You already got me
candy and flowers.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.827
Well, that's just the beginning.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.161
I did research on the holiday

06:01.194 --> 06:04.432
and, trust me, I will be
checking all the boxes.

06:04.465 --> 06:09.136
Oh, well, nothing says romance
like checking boxes.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.972
So, this Sadie Hawkins dance
checks all the boxes.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.642
It ends early so I won't
be tired for Mathletes

06:14.675 --> 06:16.710
the next morning.
I get school credit

06:16.744 --> 06:19.012
for doing the decorations
and I like the break

06:19.046 --> 06:21.181
with traditional gender roles
in the dating process.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.883
Sounds great.
Couldn't agree more.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.585
You should definitely go.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.086
That's what I was thinking.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.188
But I need to
ask you something.
Yes.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.157
I haven't even
asked you yet.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.525
Doesn't matter.
I accept.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.094
Great. I'm sure it
won't take too long.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.630
Mm, wait.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.131
What won't take too long?

06:38.165 --> 06:39.900
The tutoring.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.802
I need you to tutor Jesse Colt.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.805
He's in my civics class,
but he's failing trig.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.707
And if he doesn't ace
Friday's quiz,

06:46.740 --> 06:49.710
his parents take away his car,
make him quit basketball

06:49.743 --> 06:51.979
and forbid him to
go to the dance.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.815
I need him to go to that dance,
Ralph.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.851
Mm, because he's helping
with the decorations, too?

06:57.885 --> 07:00.187
No, because he has
the eyes of Paul Newman

07:00.220 --> 07:01.922
and the shoulders of Atlas.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.891
Oh.

07:03.924 --> 07:04.892
Sadie Hawkins
is the perfect opportunity

07:04.925 --> 07:06.026
for me to ask him out.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.497
And you're the smartest
person I know.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.998
If anyone can get

07:11.031 --> 07:14.568
Jesse through trig and
to the dance, it's you.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.770
He's outside.
Can I get him?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.205
Please?

07:18.238 --> 07:19.507
I need your help.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.642
Okay.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.650
SYLVESTER:
Sorry, Ralph.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.851
That sucks.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.560
Some entertainment
while my love recuperates.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.795
Just hooking up the antenna...

07:41.829 --> 07:43.764
You don't see the irony
of a tech genius

07:43.797 --> 07:45.866
hooking up a
40-year-old TV?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.768
Well, since I don't have
a TV in my loft,

07:47.801 --> 07:49.102
I had to make do
with what I could find

07:49.136 --> 07:50.671
behind the trailer.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.805
Voilà.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.974
It's a little bit shaky,
but it'll work.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.576
REPORTER:
The crashed medevac chopper
Oh, thank you.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.977
is lodged in the girders

07:57.010 --> 08:00.013
high atop the still-under-
construction skyscraper

08:00.047 --> 08:01.715
behind me.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.752
Pilot and passenger are alive,
but firefighters are unable

08:04.785 --> 08:07.588
to reach them, stymied by both
the height of the accident site

08:07.621 --> 08:09.890
and the strong Santa Ana winds

08:09.923 --> 08:12.125
that brought down the chopper
in the first place.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.995
Stay tuned as we bring you more
on this developing story.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.165
This sounds like the kind of
case we normally get called for.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.967
(cell phone rings)
Hello?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.802
Hi, Cabe.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.737
Toby, Happy, gear up.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.138
We've got to get a doctor
and a pilot

08:25.172 --> 08:26.574
from a chopper on a girder.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.641
Well, that made sense.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.742
Hey, you guys
are headed out?

08:28.776 --> 08:30.911
What about me?
You stay.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.881
With sicky? I'm about
to leave this den of germs.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.750
We'll need you on our servers
tracking wind patterns downtown,

08:36.784 --> 08:38.752
figure a way to
predict gusts.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.320
Copy that.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.723
Hey, uh, Ralph,
Sly's gonna be busy,

08:42.756 --> 08:43.991
so help your mom
if she needs it.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.563
Can I talk to you for a moment?

08:49.597 --> 08:51.231
I'll meet you outside
in a second.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.337
Who's that young man?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.707
Jesse Colt.
More like Jesse Dolt.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.775
Check it out.
Hey, Jesse,

09:01.809 --> 09:03.276
after we study
right triangles,

09:03.310 --> 09:05.613
we should take a look
at wrong triangles. Okay?

09:05.646 --> 09:08.315
Cool, dude.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.583
Okay, he's a dullard.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.620
That's why you're allowing him
to do those problems improperly?

09:12.653 --> 09:15.122
Ralph, I saw the worksheet.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.058
Patty wants to ask him
to the dance.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.727
If he fails, he can't go.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.995
Then maybe she'll ask me.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.997
Okay, so, I-I have
to go save some people,

09:24.031 --> 09:25.833
so I don't have time to
get into this right now,

09:25.866 --> 09:28.368
but this is not the way
to earn Patty's company.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.369
You're better than this.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.671
You can't talk.

09:30.704 --> 09:31.772
You already have my mom.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.874
You don't know
what it's like.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.378
Gust took that bird right down.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.213
No way to the top.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.716
Copter rotors severed
the elevator cables.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.084
Ladders don't reach.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.019
Wind's too strong to climb up.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.656
Crash debris is blocking
the copter door

09:48.689 --> 09:51.224
so the pilot and passenger
can't exit.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.325
Now, you guys
have a reputation

09:52.359 --> 09:53.727
for creative thinking.

09:53.761 --> 09:54.662
Hoping you might have

09:54.695 --> 09:57.097
an out-of-the-box solution
for this mess.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.866
Are the people inside hurt?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.100
Just bumps and bruises.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.235
If the chopper isn't working
and the people inside are okay,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.404
why not just wait
until the wind dies down?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.674
Can't. Passenger's
Dr. Alicia Miller,

10:06.707 --> 10:08.909
thoracic reconstructive surgeon.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.177
She was being flown in

10:10.210 --> 10:12.079
to save a car accident victim

10:12.112 --> 10:13.981
with a hole torn in his sternum.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.983
From what I've heard,
he hasn't got much time

10:16.016 --> 10:17.751
if she can't get to him.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.920
Toby, is there any way
you could do the surgery?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.855
No, no, chest wall
reconstruction is brutal.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.357
I try to pull that off without
practice, I could kill the guy.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.126
CABE:
So the only nearby

10:26.159 --> 10:28.361
qualified doctor
is stuck up there

10:28.395 --> 10:30.130
and the man
she needs to save

10:30.163 --> 10:33.200
is dying in the hospital
right across the street.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.768
Chief, have you
established contact?

10:34.802 --> 10:36.870
Yeah...

10:38.438 --> 10:40.107
Hello?
BENAVIDEZ: Dr. Miller.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.809
The team I told you
about is here.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.410
Hey. Dr. Miller,
my name's Walter O'Brien.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.412
Now, how are the conditions?

10:45.445 --> 10:47.881
Uh, scary.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.282
Wind's rattling us hard.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.718
Okay, sit tight.
You will be saved.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.919
Walter, don't make
those kinds of promises

10:51.952 --> 10:53.020
until you have a plan.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.221
WALTER:
I do have a plan.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.756
I started devising it
after Cabe called.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.124
Now, Sly, how's
that task coming

10:57.157 --> 10:59.893
I gave you?
Yeah, I'm hacked
into a weather monitor

10:59.927 --> 11:02.162
on the roof of a TV station
down the street from you,

11:02.195 --> 11:05.298
as well as every anemometer
upwind for 30 miles.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.034
I'll be able to warn you

11:07.067 --> 11:09.036
a few seconds
before any big wind gusts.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.403
That's excellent.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.872
Happy, grab the winch
from your truck.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.240
Toby, grab two

11:13.273 --> 11:15.175
metal oxygen tanks
from the hospital

11:15.208 --> 11:16.176
and then meet me
on its roof.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.310
And Cabe, I need a big

11:17.344 --> 11:18.311
piece of PVC pipe

11:18.345 --> 11:20.480
from the construction site
over there. Chief?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.082
Grab me a fire axe?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.383
What the hell
are you gonna do?

11:23.416 --> 11:25.719
I'm gonna go to the top
of the building,

11:25.753 --> 11:28.355
and I'm bringing
those people down.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.261
♪

11:42.502 --> 11:44.471
(wind rushing, howling)

11:44.504 --> 11:46.173
So it's gonna be tricky.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.274
I got the oxygen!

11:47.307 --> 11:49.476
Excellent.
Walt.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.478
The doctor who gave me these
told me the patient waiting

11:51.511 --> 11:53.080
for Dr. Miller's
in a really bad way.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.116
It's a 21-year-old kid
with a hole in his sternum,

11:56.149 --> 11:57.484
and it compromised
his thoracic cavity,

11:57.517 --> 11:59.820
just destroying
its normal vacuum.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.854
He can't breathe
on his own.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.956
And he's intubated,
but every time his lungs fill,

12:02.990 --> 12:04.925
there's a chance
it's gonna extrude

12:04.958 --> 12:06.860
through the chest opening
and tear.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.829
And the surgical fix
is really intricate.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.799
So we got to get the specialist
in the sky on terra firma,

12:11.832 --> 12:13.033
or that dude is a goner.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.034
Winch!

12:14.067 --> 12:15.535
Pipe!
And axe!

12:15.568 --> 12:17.404
That's the worst
law firm name ever.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.372
Great. Now we just need
one more thing: magnets.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.507
And four of them.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.209
Uh, if your plan involves
what I think it involves,

12:22.242 --> 12:23.476
you're insane.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.078
Why? What's insane about it?
WALTER: Nothing.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.847
It's a brilliant plan.
Now, the magnets would need

12:26.880 --> 12:30.050
to be light and very strong,
like, uh... neodymium.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.285
Uh, well, open MRI machines
use neodymium.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.787
Hospital probably has them,

12:33.821 --> 12:35.288
but they're not just gonna
hand them over

12:35.322 --> 12:37.224
like they did
these O2 tanks.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.525
Let's flash our badges,
get these guys what they need.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.827
Come on.
All right.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.164
I couldn't help
but notice that this hospital

12:44.197 --> 12:46.233
is in the same health system
as our doctor.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.168
Yeah, 'cause you looked
it up on your phone.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.303
Okay, comms off. Now.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.274
You said that
our fertility test results

12:54.307 --> 12:55.843
could already be in the system,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.544
which means that when
we're finished with the job,

12:57.577 --> 12:59.980
all we'd have to do is take a
peek on one of those computers.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.248
Would barely even be illegal.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.515
They're our results.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.051
And the doctor's gonna
call with them tomorrow.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.418
Just got to be patient.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.020
Waiting is driving me nuts.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.155
If you're right, and there's
nothing wrong with me,

13:08.188 --> 13:11.224
you should want me to know
sooner rather than later.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.160
Get that thing cracked open yet?

13:13.193 --> 13:14.862
Working on it.
How long does
it take

13:14.895 --> 13:16.429
to remove a few screws?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.165
Not long,
if you focus on the job.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.232
I am focused.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.268
Okay. Remember,

13:21.301 --> 13:22.569
these magnets are strong,
so watch

13:22.602 --> 13:23.570
your phones and any metal.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.605
Will this be okay?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.307
TOBY:
Hello.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.176
Somebody went all out for V Day.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.444
With the bail money back,
I was able to spend a few bucks

13:31.478 --> 13:32.880
for a nice present for Allie.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.882
If it's real gold,
you should be fine.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.283
How cheap do you think I am?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.285
Well, your cereal box
says "Cereal."

13:38.318 --> 13:41.088
Generic
is how you get your savings.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.257
Okay, that's all the magnets.
Let's get the chief and go.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.461
What's that?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.898
Hospital window washer's rig.

13:50.931 --> 13:51.999
HAPPY:
Good thinking, boss.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.267
Seat will make the ride
a little bit more comfortable.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.869
Why?

13:55.903 --> 13:57.337
What exactly is your plan?

13:57.370 --> 13:58.405
We're gonna launch
the winch cable

13:58.438 --> 14:00.407
from here on the hospital roof
across the street,

14:00.440 --> 14:01.608
up and over a girder...

14:01.641 --> 14:03.343
PAIGE: Walter.
...near the crashed chopper.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.378
Do you plan on having your butt
in the window washer's seat?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.080
Paige, you should be resting.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.248
CABE:
Hey,

14:08.281 --> 14:09.416
how are you gonna pull this off?

14:09.449 --> 14:11.218
Math and physics.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.619
Yeah, thanks
for clearing that up.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.087
Chief, can you grab
those cinderblocks,

14:14.121 --> 14:16.156
and Cabe, the PVC pipe?

14:29.002 --> 14:31.338
You're just guessing at the aim?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.306
We don't have to.
We know the adjacent...

14:33.340 --> 14:35.208
About 140 feet across.

14:35.242 --> 14:35.909
...and the opposite.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.611
Eight stories up, so 80 feet.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.580
So we can find the tangent.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.215
140 feet across, 80 feet up...

14:42.249 --> 14:43.283
35 degrees.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.184
I was gonna say that.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.585
Walt, angle it 35 degrees.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.120
WALTER:
Was that Ralph I heard?

14:47.154 --> 14:48.655
Can you tell him
I really appreciate

14:48.688 --> 14:50.257
the accurate trigonometry
calculations?

14:50.290 --> 14:53.393
I'll be sure to pass that along.

14:53.426 --> 14:56.296
Is he making
a snide trigonometry comment?

14:56.329 --> 14:57.364
All right, that's the math.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.966
Now, what's the physics?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.567
Newton's third law of motion.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.137
For every action, there's
an equal and opposite reaction.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.438
(shouts)

15:13.380 --> 15:15.548
BENAVIDEZ:
You made a zip line,

15:15.582 --> 15:17.250
but it's going the wrong way.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.019
You can't slide up it.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.253
Slide, no.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.589
Propel? Yes.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.624
REPORTER: It appears some type
of cable has been connected

15:24.657 --> 15:26.659
between the two buildings.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.695
I can't believe it,
but I think someone

15:28.728 --> 15:31.731
is going to try to traverse
the gap in these winds.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.433
Walter, what are you doing?

15:33.466 --> 15:34.567
Sly, what is he doing?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.636
Can't talk now. Computing.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.171
BENAVIDEZ:
Won't it wrap you around

15:38.205 --> 15:40.974
that girder the way it did
the winch cable?

15:41.008 --> 15:43.176
Not if we're precise about the
amount of oxygen in the tank.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.445
We need enough O2
to get Walt to the beam.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.613
SYLVESTER:
Figuring that out now.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.647
Walt, what's your body weight?

15:47.680 --> 15:48.648
160.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.550
You weighed yourself lately?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.652
I've been 160 pounds for years.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.288
No, studies show that people
in new, happy relationships

15:55.322 --> 15:56.389
gain weight.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.390
You sure you haven't put on

15:57.424 --> 15:59.192
a couple of love pounds
since you and Paige

15:59.226 --> 16:00.760
got together
last spring?
I'm positive.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.095
I'm fit as a fiddle.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.196
SYLVESTER:
Okay.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.664
You need 1,800 psi.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.634
(air escaping)

16:07.667 --> 16:09.469
Okay!

16:09.502 --> 16:11.338
Aw, this is crazy!

16:11.371 --> 16:12.472
WALTER: Well, you
said you wanted

16:12.505 --> 16:14.207
outside-of-the-box thinking.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.642
All right, Cabe,
when you're ready.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.776
Okay!

16:16.809 --> 16:18.645
Hold on, Walt!

16:20.180 --> 16:22.015
(whimpering)

16:22.049 --> 16:23.316
(screaming)

16:28.788 --> 16:31.258
An unknown man
is rocketing across the cable.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.093
Whoa...

16:33.126 --> 16:34.194
(screaming)

16:36.596 --> 16:38.131
Oh, no.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.666
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh!

16:39.699 --> 16:41.368
Ah, he's sliding
back down!

16:41.401 --> 16:43.403
(shouting)

16:45.105 --> 16:47.107
(panting, grunting)

16:53.713 --> 16:55.048
TOBY:
Walt!

16:55.082 --> 16:56.649
You okay?
No!

16:58.218 --> 16:59.452
I have to pull myself up

16:59.486 --> 17:00.687
to the girder!

17:00.720 --> 17:03.590
This is not easy.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.395
Maybe somebody weighs
a bit more than 160 pounds.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.397
Walter, hurry. They're saying
on the news the guy

17:10.430 --> 17:12.232
from the car accident
is critical.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.200
Doc, go check him out.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.801
I'm not prepared to handle
that kind of injury.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.469
Okay, you're smarter
than the quacks down there.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.704
Maybe you'll figure
something out.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.539
And I could make things worse.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.607
Toby, listen to your wife,
damn it!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.175
Language.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.445
Walter, there's
a 75-mile-per-hour gust

17:25.478 --> 17:27.247
coming in 2.8 seconds.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.353
Oh, boy.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.155
REPORTER:
...what are being called
"minor bumps and bruises"

17:35.188 --> 17:37.324
in the crash. Dr. Miller...

17:37.357 --> 17:39.426
2.8 seconds warning?
Are you kidding me?

17:39.459 --> 17:40.760
He's swinging around
like a piñata up there.

17:40.793 --> 17:41.694
I'm doing the best I can.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.330
This isn't really
the best place to study.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.331
You kidding me?

17:44.364 --> 17:46.166
You're getting every one right.
Just keep going.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.767
(sighs)

17:48.835 --> 17:49.869
Hello again.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.138
Smokey the bear.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.372
What the hell?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.708
Maybe this isn't
the best place to study.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.877
Sorry, I have masklophobia.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.547
It's the fear
of full-body mascot costumes.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.450
Their expressionless
faces mimic death.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.419
Another one of your deliveries
came to my door.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.755
He delivers
only nightmares.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.390
Just trying to make a buck, man.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.559
Good. My singing telegram
is there?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.627
Have him do it loudly
so I can hear.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.663
Hear what?
♪ It might

18:16.696 --> 18:19.766
♪ Em-bear-ass you to hear it,
so just grin and bear it ♪

18:19.799 --> 18:22.769
♪ Someone loves you bunches,
and I'm here to share it ♪

18:22.802 --> 18:25.738
♪ I come from the woods
where I do my business ♪

18:25.772 --> 18:29.309
♪ To proclaim my love for you,
for all to witness ♪

18:29.342 --> 18:31.344
♪ As a bear I cannot swear,
but I've got ♪

18:31.378 --> 18:33.513
♪ A hunch

18:33.546 --> 18:35.548
♪ That

18:35.582 --> 18:37.184
♪ Walter loves you

18:37.217 --> 18:41.354
♪ Bear-y, much.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.555
Jazz hands.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.224
(sneezes)

18:44.257 --> 18:46.526
That was... that was festive.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.161
Huh? You enjoyed it.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.329
Excellent.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.331
He rhymed "hunch" with "much."

18:51.364 --> 18:52.365
It's assonance.

18:52.399 --> 18:53.800
It's asinine.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.371
Begone, demon!
You people suck, man.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.472
(coughing)

18:59.506 --> 19:00.673
Are you okay?

19:00.707 --> 19:02.575
She is a carrier of disease.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.911
I just got over a cold.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.746
I could whip up some
of the all-natural cough syrup

19:06.779 --> 19:07.847
I synthesized for myself.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.148
Okay, thanks.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.456
For the record,
I think mascots are creepy, too.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.259
(chuckles softly)

19:19.292 --> 19:22.462
WALTER:
I'm almost there.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.765
(grunts)

19:28.368 --> 19:30.470
If anyone cares,

19:30.503 --> 19:32.572
I made it to the girder.
Okay.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.508
Now all Walt has to do it get
the pilot and doc out.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.944
And they zipline
right back down to us.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.946
Can't believe he made it across.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.215
Math and physics. Simple.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.683
Yeah.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.419
Well, it's actually
not that simple.

19:46.453 --> 19:49.722
Crash punctured
the helicopter's fuel tank.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.291
It's leaking gas.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.725
Crap. We can't get them
out of there.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.826
Why the hell not?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.495
Because the hot,
dry Santa Ana winds

19:55.528 --> 19:58.331
most likely created
a static electric charge

19:58.365 --> 20:00.600
all over the metal chopper.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.769
If Walter makes contact with it,
or if anybody inside touches

20:02.802 --> 20:04.371
the ground, the resulting spark

20:04.404 --> 20:07.574
will cause the chopper to burst
into flames and explode.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.242
TOBY:
Guys, things are not any better

20:09.276 --> 20:11.711
down here, that pressure bandage
is not holding.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.414
Uh, Walt? This kid might have
the rest of his life

20:14.447 --> 20:16.283
ahead of him,
but if you don't find a way

20:16.316 --> 20:17.850
to get Dr. Miller down here,
that might be only ten minutes.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.266
CABE: So long as there's fuel
and static charge

20:33.300 --> 20:34.233
on the metal...

20:34.267 --> 20:35.535
We are not getting out
of this helicopter.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.503
Exactly.

20:36.536 --> 20:37.837
So you just sit tight,

20:37.870 --> 20:38.971
and we'll figure it out.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.476
My socks stick to my sweater
every load of laundry.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.312
I just peel it off;
static electricity can't be

20:45.345 --> 20:46.446
that big of a problem.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.416
It can be dangerous.
Come here, Mom.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.918
You know how you build a static
charge sliding across your seat

20:51.951 --> 20:52.985
getting out
of your car?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.722
Look what happens
when you touch a metal gas pump.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.390
PAIGE:
Oh, God.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.991
You shouldn't be looking
at things like that.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.593
Go back to studying
with your friend.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.994
He's not my friend.
Walter, are you

21:02.028 --> 21:04.397
absolutely sure that there's
a static charge up there?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.399
Um... well,
I still have the receipt

21:06.433 --> 21:08.000
for your chocolates
in my pocket.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.603
Here, I'll test it.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.805
Yeah, we're screwed.

21:12.839 --> 21:13.873
Uh, maybe not.

21:13.906 --> 21:14.874
When I paint cars,

21:14.907 --> 21:16.075
I use an antistatic gun

21:16.108 --> 21:18.411
to remove any charge
from the metal

21:18.445 --> 21:19.812
so the paint goes on smooth.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.481
Well, let's get one
of those guns up to Water.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.349
TOBY:
No, not practical.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.317
By the time you find one
and rig a way

21:24.351 --> 21:25.885
to get it to Walt,
this guy down here'll die.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.854
WALTER: Okay,
if we can't get a static gun,

21:27.887 --> 21:28.888
then we can make one.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.357
And the hell
we gonna do that?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.624
Okay, those guns
use electricity

21:31.658 --> 21:33.993
to create
a positively charged pin

21:34.026 --> 21:35.895
and a negatively charged pin.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.630
Then they blow
air past them,

21:37.664 --> 21:40.533
propelling the ions onto the
surface you want to de-static.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.370
The charges attract
and nullify their opposites,

21:43.403 --> 21:44.771
rendering the object neutral.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.972
We have plenty of blowing air,

21:46.005 --> 21:49.809
so we just need a positive
and a negative electric charge.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.481
And I think
I know how to get one.

21:54.514 --> 21:57.350
Okay, Sly...

21:57.384 --> 21:59.018
I'm on the move.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.887
(woozy groaning)

22:00.920 --> 22:01.721
Just warn me if you see

22:01.754 --> 22:03.122
any big gusts coming.
Roger that.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.092
I need to see what's going on--
I'm gonna go watch
on the TV upstairs.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.694
You do that.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.432
And to find the tangent,

22:12.465 --> 22:14.834
just divide the adjacent side
by the triangle's hypotenuse.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.672
Ralph, may I
bend your ear?

22:21.974 --> 22:24.377
(whispers): Don't want
to hinder your tutoring,

22:24.411 --> 22:26.913
but tangent is opposite side
over the adjacent.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.949
(smacks lips) I know,
but turd-for-brains doesn't.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.984
Now, mind your own business.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.986
Oh, my.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.588
Wha-What was that?

22:35.622 --> 22:37.490
Uh... I just said

22:37.524 --> 22:39.559
you're picking it up
like nobody's business.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.127
Oh. Cool, dude.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.463
What's this?

22:43.496 --> 22:44.797
You seemed upset
by Paige's germs,

22:44.831 --> 22:46.633
so I mixed up
a disinfectant solution--

22:46.666 --> 22:47.967
colloidal silver and

22:48.000 --> 22:50.169
a three percent concentration
of hydrogen peroxide.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.605
I don't know what to say.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.441
Consider it a holiday gift.
(laughs softly)

22:54.474 --> 22:56.075
For Valentine's Day?

22:56.108 --> 22:57.510
Sure.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.447
Where's Paige?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.615
She's upstairs
watching Walter on TV.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.183
I have no idea what that means,

23:04.216 --> 23:06.786
but I assume
I'll find out shortly.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.088
Hey, by the
way, I, uh...

23:10.122 --> 23:11.991
...I think it's great

23:12.024 --> 23:13.993
how well you and Paige
are getting along.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.194
It could have
been weird

23:15.227 --> 23:16.062
after she found out

23:16.095 --> 23:17.630
that Walter dreamt
about kissing you.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.799
Paige knows?

23:21.133 --> 23:24.036
What's that thing
Happy always says?

23:24.070 --> 23:26.506
"Damn it, Toby,
put a baby in me already"?

23:26.539 --> 23:27.907
Not that one.
The other one.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.908
"Not good"?

23:28.941 --> 23:31.043
That's the one.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.620
(wind howling)

23:40.653 --> 23:42.021
Oh!

23:43.923 --> 23:45.758
(panting)

23:45.792 --> 23:49.161
Just as I thought-- the elevator
cables weren't the only things

23:49.195 --> 23:51.564
severed in the crash--
the power line got sliced, too.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.999
There's no juice.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.602
The power got cut off
when the contractor went bust

23:55.635 --> 23:56.703
and construction stopped.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.037
HAPPY:
I can jack the building

23:58.070 --> 23:58.905
back into the grid.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.039
How long'll that take?

24:00.072 --> 24:01.741
I won't know
until I'm down there,

24:01.774 --> 24:02.809
see what I'm working with.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.010
Toby, buy us some more time.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.646
Hey! Doc, my pal's got an idea
to get Dr. Miller down here.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.248
Y-You just got to find
a way to keep that patient
alive a little bit longer,

24:09.281 --> 24:11.618
by any means necessary.
Dr. Curtis, my patient

24:11.651 --> 24:13.653
is being kept alive
by artificial means.

24:13.686 --> 24:14.887
Spit, bubble gum,
a wing and a prayer.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.156
We don't need you to add
any pressure on us.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.659
Pressure. That's it.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.193
Dr. Grumpy! I'm gonna
have a solution for you

24:21.227 --> 24:22.529
in a matter of minutes.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.630
Cabe, ask the chief

24:23.663 --> 24:25.898
if any of the emergency
vehicles have a hazmat suit.

24:25.932 --> 24:28.000
Hey, Chief, are your people
carrying hazmat suits with 'em?

24:28.034 --> 24:30.537
Affirmative.
Get one to the ICU ASAP.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.205
Hey, Doc, your children's
wing's got to have a pump

24:33.239 --> 24:35.942
to blow up balls and
stuff-- could you send
someone to get it?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.877
Also, I'm gonna
need surgical glue

24:37.910 --> 24:40.246
and tape. Quick.
Why?

24:40.279 --> 24:42.214
I'm gonna Scorpion
the hell out of your patient.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.950
REPORTER:
No word yet from the rescuer

24:43.983 --> 24:46.185
who made it to the top
of the building,

24:46.218 --> 24:48.955
but with forecasts calling for
the wind to strengthen this...

24:48.988 --> 24:50.690
I can't listen.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.292
Being sidelined is,
like, nerve-wracking.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.094
More reason

24:55.127 --> 24:56.262
to lie down.

24:56.295 --> 24:58.064
I had this virus--
it's a doozy.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.833
Come on, just...
Yeah, get in bed.

25:01.834 --> 25:02.902
Nice and easy.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.103
Okay.
Lay down there.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.573
FLORENCE:
That's good.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.707
PAIGE:
Much better.

25:07.740 --> 25:08.975
You're spying.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.878
I may have
accidentally ruined

25:11.911 --> 25:13.846
Paige and Florence's friendship
with a slip of the tongue.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.848
I just want to see
how much damage I caused.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.717
You told her about Walt's dream.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.918
You know about that?

25:18.951 --> 25:20.853
(scoffs)
Secrets in this garage

25:20.887 --> 25:23.790
have the staying power
of Aristotelian physics.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.858
Scram. Continue
to spread mathematical fiction

25:25.892 --> 25:27.059
to that poor boy.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.928
How do you know about that?

25:28.961 --> 25:31.197
I can sniff out bad math work
like a truffle.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.599
Now, let me spy.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.668
FLORENCE:
Here's the medicine I promised.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.771
It's a concentrated
ethanol extraction

25:38.805 --> 25:40.773
of ma huang with pineapple
and peppermint.

25:40.807 --> 25:43.009
Suppresses coughs
more efficiently

25:43.042 --> 25:44.076
than the over-
the-counter stuff,

25:44.110 --> 25:45.311
and it tastes a lot better, too.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.614
It's better
than this swill Walter gave me.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.248
Put that over there.
Yeah.

25:50.617 --> 25:53.152
Speaking of Walter...

25:53.185 --> 25:57.289
I understand that you
are aware of his dream,

25:57.323 --> 25:58.858
and I want
to stress to you

25:58.891 --> 26:00.993
that there is nothing...

26:01.027 --> 26:02.595
between us.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.897
Okay? In his injured
and vulnerable state,

26:04.931 --> 26:05.965
he was just...

26:05.998 --> 26:08.935
Having a subconscious reaction
to your presence.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.037
Toby explained.
Correct.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.606
Walter doesn't feel
anything romantic towards me.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.975
And-and I could never
be attracted to him.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.276
Why not?

26:17.309 --> 26:19.145
What's wrong with Walter?
He's an amazing man.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.980
Why-why would you never be
attracted to him?

26:21.013 --> 26:22.749
I meant... no offense.

26:22.782 --> 26:23.783
It's just...

26:23.816 --> 26:25.785
he and I are alike.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.186
(sighs)

26:27.219 --> 26:29.021
Too much head,
too little heart. Hmm.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.890
(chuckles):
He can be that way sometimes.

26:30.923 --> 26:31.824
As much as I

26:31.858 --> 26:34.360
appreciate it,
he painted by the numbers

26:34.393 --> 26:37.029
with the candy, flowers,

26:37.063 --> 26:38.765
with the card signed
"Walter O'Brien"

26:38.798 --> 26:40.733
and the bear
who sang the same song

26:40.767 --> 26:42.635
for a lot of other people today.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.103
And he doesn't get...

26:44.136 --> 26:46.639
yet that...

26:46.673 --> 26:49.175
the emotions aren't a formula.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.910
Well, then it's
a very good thing

26:50.943 --> 26:53.012
that you have enough heart
for the both of you.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.747
'Cause that's
what I need.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.316
A smart man, sure,
but one who is sweet

26:57.349 --> 26:59.618
and caring and vulnerable.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.959
So...

27:06.993 --> 27:09.061
feel better. Yeah.

27:09.095 --> 27:10.096
Thank you.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.672
Oh. Oh, come on.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.376
What is this?

27:30.116 --> 27:32.985
Good night, Sylvester.
Hey, Florence,
I just wanted

27:33.019 --> 27:36.022
to say thank you again for
the disinfectant solution.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.690
You know what
they say:

27:37.724 --> 27:38.825
If you're not part
of the solution,

27:38.858 --> 27:40.727
you're part of
the precipitate.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.963
That's a very clever
chemistry joke.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.364
Precipitate.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.067
(laughs)

27:49.168 --> 27:51.037
(rapid beeping)

27:54.140 --> 27:55.808
Walt, big
wind coming.

27:55.842 --> 27:56.843
Hang on.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.411
(wind rushing, whistling)

27:59.445 --> 28:00.780
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.982
The wind's definitely
getting stronger.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.984
Okay, I'm almost finished

28:05.017 --> 28:08.320
creating my part
of our makeshift antistatic gun.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.289
Now, Happy,
how's your part coming?

28:10.322 --> 28:11.791
When the workers cut the power,

28:11.824 --> 28:14.460
they left a mess--
I am doing the best I can.

28:14.493 --> 28:15.261
How's the patient
holding up, Doc?

28:15.294 --> 28:17.429
I'm gonna let you know
in a minute.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.734
Want to explain this to me?
Yeah,

28:21.768 --> 28:23.803
the pressure bandage wasn't
holding the lung in place,

28:23.836 --> 28:25.204
so we're making a pressure suit.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.106
Now you pump.

28:34.013 --> 28:34.847
HAPPY:
Hey, hubby,

28:34.881 --> 28:36.749
while the chief pumps,
why don't you do

28:36.783 --> 28:38.818
a little hacking
and find out our test results?

28:38.851 --> 28:39.952
'Cause that's a federal crime.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.153
I bet the results are bad,

28:41.187 --> 28:43.389
and he's sitting on them
so he doesn't ruin

28:43.422 --> 28:45.057
my last happy Valentine's Day.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.926
How is this
a happy Valentine's Day?

28:46.959 --> 28:48.895
Now, can you stop worrying
about the test,

28:48.928 --> 28:51.263
and get me some power?
Done.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.531
(rumbling, crackling)

28:52.564 --> 28:54.901
Whoa. Not done.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.502
Doc, I'm gonna need that guy
to stay alive

28:56.535 --> 28:58.304
a little bit longer.
TOBY:
The suit's holding,

28:58.337 --> 29:00.039
preventing further
lung damage.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.774
(rapid beeping)

29:01.808 --> 29:03.910
And the bad news is
the increased pressure's

29:03.943 --> 29:05.812
also raising his BP
by the second.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.147
So, guys,
we can't keep this up forever.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.116
Happy, you're rewiring
a junction box.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.118
You could do that in your sleep.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.854
Okay, screw you, O'Brien.
I'm distracted.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.789
I know. That's the problem.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.390
PAIGE:
Walter, you need to

29:18.424 --> 29:20.827
be patient.
We can't be patient, or else

29:20.860 --> 29:22.194
we'll lose the patient.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.462
Hey, she's doing
the best she can.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.897
TOBY:
Can everyone please shut up?

29:24.931 --> 29:27.333
I'm in the system,
finding our test results.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.935
That's gonna make Happy happy,

29:28.968 --> 29:30.536
so she can focus
and get the job done.

29:30.569 --> 29:34.140
All right, our results are in.

29:34.173 --> 29:37.243
(wind rushing)

29:43.015 --> 29:44.851
Oh, no.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.426
Tell me what's wrong
with me, Doc.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.095
Nothing.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.831
I'm the reason
we can't have kids.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.167
Wait, it's your seed,
not my soil?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.568
I have a...

30:02.601 --> 30:04.603
Y chromosome deletion.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.038
Immature sperm cells.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.439
Even your sperm is immature?

30:07.473 --> 30:10.076
(rapid beeping)
NURSE: Pulse is still elevated.

30:10.109 --> 30:14.146
We'll deal with it later.
Our pal's BP is sky-high, guys.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.049
Okay, I've got this thing
sorted-- here goes nothing.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.318
(electrical humming)

30:19.351 --> 30:21.453
Oh-ho! We have electricity.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.389
Now we just need
a large burst of wind

30:23.422 --> 30:25.157
to propel the ions
onto the copter,

30:25.191 --> 30:26.926
nullifying the static charge.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.862
Ask and you shall receive.
There's one headed your way.

30:29.896 --> 30:32.831
(wind howling)

30:34.633 --> 30:36.468
It's working--
the wind is blowing

30:36.502 --> 30:38.237
the electric ions
around the chopper,

30:38.270 --> 30:39.906
removing the static charge.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.340
Walter, please be careful.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.077
Static's gone!

30:45.111 --> 30:48.080
♪

30:48.114 --> 30:49.281
(grunts)

30:53.019 --> 30:54.987
Here, hold my hand,
hold my hand.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.522
Steady.
Mr. O'Brien,
thank you.

30:56.555 --> 30:57.789
Well, don't thank me just yet.

30:57.823 --> 31:00.226
I'm about to send you down the
scariest zip line of your life.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.128
Here. Watch your stop.
Follow me, okay?

31:02.161 --> 31:03.229
Oh, wait, my medical bag!

31:03.262 --> 31:04.663
It has the rib
reconstruction matrix

31:04.696 --> 31:06.365
that I need for surgery!

31:06.398 --> 31:08.367
I'll get it.
WALTER:
Okay, hurry, hurry.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.240
Okay. Okay.
I got you.

31:16.142 --> 31:18.177
Yeah?
Okay.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.211
Hurry!

31:24.283 --> 31:26.285
Oh, thank you.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.155
What's that?

31:29.188 --> 31:32.458
Uh, it's my way down,
but you guys first.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.526
Walt, winds are picking up.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.627
Okay, ready?

31:35.661 --> 31:37.563
Okay, send them down!

31:37.596 --> 31:39.165
Okay, go!

31:40.566 --> 31:41.600
Here they come!

31:45.304 --> 31:46.705
I got you.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.706
(exhales)

31:47.739 --> 31:49.541
CABE: It's okay,
you're safe.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.645
All right.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.082
Go, get to your patient.
Thank you.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.449
And you.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.285
Get that head
checked downstairs.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.291
All right, Walt, you're up.

32:05.324 --> 32:06.525
SYLVESTER:
No, no, don't go!

32:06.558 --> 32:08.527
There's a 74-mile-per-hour
gust coming.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.029
That's hurricane force.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.564
Walt, hold on to your butt.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.600
(wind rushing)

32:18.537 --> 32:20.539
Ah!

32:21.607 --> 32:23.442
WALTER:
Guys, we have a problem,

32:23.475 --> 32:24.610
a big problem.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.315
The fuel caught fire!

32:29.348 --> 32:31.417
That helicopter's gonna blow!

32:36.755 --> 32:39.691
The cable snapped.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.561
I have no way
of getting off this thing.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.296
Is there anywhere
you can take cover?

32:44.330 --> 32:46.465
There's no place to hide.
If the shrapnel doesn't get me,

32:46.498 --> 32:47.733
then the force of the explosion
will throw me off.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.601
Walt, we're prepping
for surgery now.

32:49.635 --> 32:50.769
This guy may live
because of you.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.704
If you die, it's gonna put
a damper on the whole thing.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.106
So save yourself.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.341
How's he gonna do that?

32:55.374 --> 32:57.476
Elvita Adams.

32:57.509 --> 32:58.777
Who's Elvita Adams?

32:58.810 --> 33:00.346
I read about her
years ago.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.182
Yes, December 2, 1979.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.751
Elvita Adams fell
from the 86th floor

33:05.784 --> 33:06.885
of the Empire
State Building.

33:06.918 --> 33:10.222
And then the wind blew her
back onto the 85th floor.

33:10.256 --> 33:11.990
She survived with nothing
but a broken hip.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.093
You want me to jump?

33:14.126 --> 33:15.761
No! I want you have
the power to Apparate

33:15.794 --> 33:18.097
like the teenage wizards
in Harry Potter, but you don't.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.231
So into the
wind you go.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.732
Uh...

33:20.766 --> 33:22.368
I did some quick math
in my head.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.070
His feet aren't touching ground,

33:24.103 --> 33:25.371
so there's no friction
to overcome.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.372
He's 160 pounds...

33:26.405 --> 33:27.473
Allegedly.

33:27.506 --> 33:31.110
A gust over 50 miles per hour
should do the trick.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.078
JESSE:
Um...

33:32.111 --> 33:33.079
This is all really

33:33.112 --> 33:34.580
kind of freaking me out.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.382
I'm gonna go.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.284
(sighs) Crap.
Language.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.152
HAPPY: Walt, if you don't
want to break your hip,

33:40.186 --> 33:41.087
you got to tuck and roll.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.389
Okay, but I'll have
to fall two stories

33:43.422 --> 33:44.523
to get under a floor

33:44.556 --> 33:45.757
that'll shield me
from the explosion.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.293
SYLVESTER:
One floor, two floors,

33:47.326 --> 33:48.327
it's all in the math.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.495
I've got eyes on the wind,

33:49.528 --> 33:50.662
and I will tell you
when to jump.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.630
There's got to be
another way.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.199
WALTER: No, there's no time
to think of one.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.801
The helicopter's gonna blow.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.103
Sly, say when.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.470
You got a big gust
coming up.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.372
Walt, you're only gonna
get one shot at this.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.773
Spread your arms

34:01.807 --> 34:04.143
to increase the surface area
for the wind to catch.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.112
Straight drop, no outward force.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.351
Okay, ready?

34:12.384 --> 34:13.652
In three...

34:13.685 --> 34:16.088
two... one... Jump!

34:28.867 --> 34:30.569
He made it! He's in!

34:31.703 --> 34:33.339
Okay.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.380
Walter, say something.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.253
Happy Valentine's Day, Paige.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.655
(chuckles)

34:58.230 --> 35:01.233
That's great news. Thank you.

35:01.267 --> 35:04.603
Dr. Miller's still in surgery,
but her patient is stable

35:04.636 --> 35:07.606
and all signs point
to him pulling through.
TOBY: Fantastic.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.309
At least the hospital had some
good news for someone today.

35:17.349 --> 35:20.152
What you got there?

35:20.186 --> 35:22.421
Practice quiz I gave Jesse Dolt.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.224
(sighs) He failed
with flying colors.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.526
Well, I guess I should
congratulate you.

35:27.559 --> 35:29.261
Mission accomplished.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.331
I don't know why, but I don't
feel good about this.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.201
Well...

35:37.369 --> 35:39.705
It's probably...
(groans)

35:39.738 --> 35:42.174
...because you know it's wrong.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.575
When Paige
asked me to help

35:43.609 --> 35:45.444
your father with baseball,

35:45.477 --> 35:46.878
I didn't want to.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.780
I thought if he had success

35:48.814 --> 35:51.450
then he could take you
and your mother away from me.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.685
But, sure enough,
I did the right thing,

35:53.719 --> 35:58.524
and I used science to help him
out with his-his pitching,

35:58.557 --> 36:00.426
and in the end,

36:00.459 --> 36:02.761
your mother and I ended up
together anyway

36:02.794 --> 36:04.230
and I had a
clear conscience.

36:04.263 --> 36:07.933
Sabotaging a rival
is never the way to go.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.535
Didn't you sabotage
Mom and Tim's first date

36:09.568 --> 36:10.536
to the jazz festival?

36:10.569 --> 36:11.903
I don't recall.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.873
And you put Tim in a tiny
desk in the elevator

36:14.906 --> 36:18.210
and cut him out of the
Christmas picture and...

36:18.244 --> 36:19.945
Just do as I say
and not as I sometimes did.

36:19.978 --> 36:21.713
Your mother was
very angry with me

36:21.747 --> 36:23.249
for a long time
over those things.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.983
Do you want Patty angry at you?

36:25.016 --> 36:28.387
I just want Patty to be happy.

36:28.420 --> 36:31.657
I wish I was the one
that made her happy.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.893
I'll show Jesse how to do these
problems tomorrow. Promise.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.596
Good man.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.932
(groans)

36:40.966 --> 36:42.401
(Ralph sighs)

36:42.434 --> 36:44.436
You really do have
an eavesdropping problem,

36:44.470 --> 36:45.804
you know that?

36:45.837 --> 36:47.439
Wha-- I just wanted
to make sure

36:47.473 --> 36:48.607
you were making
the right decision.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.343
Which I know is hard when
you have a crush on someone.

36:51.377 --> 36:52.378
Like you do on Florence.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.645
Huh?

36:53.679 --> 36:54.846
No.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.516
She touched your hand after
she'd been with my sick mom,

36:57.549 --> 36:59.818
and you didn't
use sanitizer afterward.

37:01.887 --> 37:05.291
Fine. I think she's interesting.

37:06.492 --> 37:09.495
And I think she
likes me, too. Right?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.563
She laughed at my joke,

37:11.597 --> 37:13.399
she gave me disinfectant
for Valentine's

37:13.432 --> 37:15.334
and the way she described

37:15.367 --> 37:17.035
her perfect guy to Paige--

37:17.068 --> 37:20.672
sweet, smart, caring
and vulnerable.

37:20.706 --> 37:21.873
Who's more vulnerable than me?

37:21.907 --> 37:23.609
I get nosebleeds on escalators.

37:23.642 --> 37:27.045
Besides, I-I won't act on it
'cause of Megan.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.647
She'd want you to be happy.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.016
I guess.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.352
Look, I know secrets
don't last long around here,

37:33.385 --> 37:35.654
but you mind keeping this one?

37:35.687 --> 37:36.922
Sure thing, pal.

37:39.891 --> 37:43.295
The technical name
for what I have is

37:43.329 --> 37:44.963
Sertoli-cell-only syndrome.

37:44.996 --> 37:49.468
Just means my dogs won't hunt.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.303
My sperm sit around
and do nothing.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.871
They're like little politicians.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.410
And I am so sorry, sweetheart.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.681
What would you say
if it were me?

38:05.584 --> 38:08.086
What would you say
if it were me?

38:08.119 --> 38:11.723
(sighs) I-I'd tell you
that I love you

38:11.757 --> 38:13.725
and that it's not your fault

38:13.759 --> 38:16.695
and that medical science has
ways around issues like these.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.598
Ditto and reverse it.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.733
Problem is, medical science
don't work cheap.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.969
The "ways around" cost money
that we just don't have.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.672
Yes, you do.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.306
Happy Valentine's.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.610
It's the money we put up
for Cabe's bail,

38:31.643 --> 38:33.311
plus the payment
from our last few jobs.

38:35.581 --> 38:39.518
There's something else
in there, too.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.755
Your gift to Allie?

38:43.789 --> 38:45.557
I told her what you
were dealing with.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.859
She insisted you return it
and get the cash.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.030
How did you already...

38:52.063 --> 38:53.699
WALTER: Fertility
treatment's expensive.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.534
We thought you might
need the help.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.436
Guys, we can't accept this.

38:57.469 --> 39:00.672
Well, it's for you.
It's for Baby Quintis.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.009
Scorpion takes care
of each other.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.445
Yeah, and that includes the team
members who aren't here yet.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.422
Okay, thank you.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.834
My back is feeling better
from that spill I took.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.937
Now we just need
to get you on the mend...

39:31.970 --> 39:33.104
What do you got here?

39:35.140 --> 39:39.778
WALTER (on recording):
♪ When I'm with you

39:39.811 --> 39:41.980
♪ My mind can rest

39:42.013 --> 39:44.883
♪ My thoughts can nest

39:46.585 --> 39:48.119
♪ Thoughts can nest

39:50.055 --> 39:52.758
(guitar strums off-key)
Stupid.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.893
I didn't mean
for you to hear that.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.597
You said it's stupid,
but it's beautiful.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.066
You tried to follow the
"Good Boyfriend's Guide to

40:01.099 --> 40:03.835
Valentine's Day,"
candies, flowers,

40:03.869 --> 40:06.772
singing woodland creatures.
It's... It's all really sweet.

40:07.973 --> 40:11.009
But Valentine's is about
sharing from your heart,

40:11.042 --> 40:12.578
and this song
is from your heart.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.979
It's so far from stupid.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.982
And finding it

40:17.015 --> 40:20.586
made it the best
Valentine's Day ever,

40:20.619 --> 40:23.121
even if it got ruined
with my cold.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.190
And I'm sorry we couldn't
go out to dinner tonight.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.559
Oh, I...

40:27.593 --> 40:30.996
I was looking forward
to spending the night in,

40:31.029 --> 40:35.534
cuddling and having
a relaxing holiday for once.

40:35.567 --> 40:38.904
(chuckles)
Yeah, sounds good.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.540
REPORTER: ...where a city bus
is hanging from a precipice

40:41.573 --> 40:43.542
on a remote canyon road.
Rescue workers have been

40:43.575 --> 40:44.676
unable to find a way

40:44.710 --> 40:46.478
to reach the people inside,

40:46.512 --> 40:48.947
and the ground is beginning
to give way.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.181
(phone ringing)

40:51.783 --> 40:54.152
Hello?

40:54.185 --> 40:55.654
Hi, Cabe.
