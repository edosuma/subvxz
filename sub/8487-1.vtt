01:52.099 --> 01:53.760
Guess what.

01:53.968 --> 01:55.595
What?

01:56.937 --> 01:58.734
I can't move.

02:00.042 --> 02:04.001
Yeah, well, you don't have to.
You're in a car.

02:09.785 --> 02:11.810
Am I driving?

02:13.388 --> 02:14.946
Like a pro.

04:05.474 --> 04:08.637
Come on, wake up, you fuck.
Come on.

05:16.849 --> 05:19.147
Did you try to help him get free?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.781
Briefly.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.388
Briefly?

05:24.590 --> 05:29.687
When it came down to it, my life
was more important to me than his.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.160
Selfish, huh?

05:38.438 --> 05:40.736
We found these...

05:42.843 --> 05:46.074
...in your Spider.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.215
Actually, I don't drive a Spider
anymore.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.783
Now I have a C8 Laviolette.

05:51.986 --> 05:54.045
It's lighter, faster...

05:54.255 --> 05:56.155
...swims better.

06:18.547 --> 06:19.912
Right.

06:20.115 --> 06:22.777
These three contain traces
of ketamine...

06:22.985 --> 06:25.886
...the same as we found in your blood
and his.

06:26.088 --> 06:31.288
This one had pure D-Tubocurarine,
DTC...

06:31.494 --> 06:34.156
...which we only found in him.

06:34.698 --> 06:37.394
Must've been something
he took at the party.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.091
No. DTC is not a party drug.

06:40.303 --> 06:43.678
Along with the other stuff in his blood,
it paralyzed his lungs.

06:43.973 --> 06:46.101
Kevin Franks did not drown.

06:46.310 --> 06:51.145
He had already stopped breathing
by the time you drove off the road.

06:51.349 --> 06:53.651
He was breathing
when we went off the road.

06:53.651 --> 06:54.852
How do you know?

06:54.852 --> 06:56.337
He was making me come.

06:57.621 --> 07:01.751
What? You were having sex
at 100 miles an hour?

07:02.094 --> 07:05.894
Hundred and ten.
I must've hit a pothole.

07:07.199 --> 07:09.463
Your friend, Dickie Pep...

07:09.735 --> 07:14.331
...says he sold you 15 milliliters
of DTC last Thursday.

07:14.539 --> 07:18.236
I don't know any Dickie Pep,
but he's lying.

07:18.443 --> 07:19.467
Or you are.

07:19.711 --> 07:20.880
Why would he lie?

07:20.880 --> 07:24.480
You got him on some other charge
and he's trying to deal his way out.

07:24.617 --> 07:25.948
If he even exists.

07:29.389 --> 07:32.790
You don't seem too upset by what's
happened.

07:32.992 --> 07:35.222
Of course I am, I'm traumatized.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.159
Who knows if I'll ever come again?

07:43.604 --> 07:45.595
I want that cunt in jail.

07:45.806 --> 07:47.603
We haven't got a case, Roy.

07:47.808 --> 07:51.904
Well, just fucking make one. Please.

07:52.112 --> 07:54.672
They'll order a psychiatric for bail.

07:54.882 --> 07:57.716
I'll make sure we get somebody
good and tough.

08:21.343 --> 08:25.837
Dr. Glass. I'm Henry Rose,
Miss Tramell's solicitor.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.278
This is Catherine Tramell.

08:28.784 --> 08:31.515
I shall be present during
the evaluation.

08:32.155 --> 08:33.884
Well, that's fine by me.

08:34.090 --> 08:38.458
I'll be asking fairly personal questions.
If she doesn't mind your presence....

08:38.662 --> 08:41.961
My client understands and agrees
I should be present for--

08:42.164 --> 08:45.225
Maybe Dr. Glass is right
and we should be alone for this.

08:45.402 --> 08:48.303
I strongly advise you
not to contemplate having--

08:48.505 --> 08:51.168
So is this where
we're going to do it?

09:06.624 --> 09:09.753
Mr. Rose told you the purpose
of this evaluation.

09:09.962 --> 09:12.328
I'm applying for bail in a murder case.

09:12.531 --> 09:16.365
The Crown wants to know
if I'm a danger to myself or others.

09:16.568 --> 09:19.628
You're the Crown's shrink,
so you'll say I'm dangerous.

09:19.838 --> 09:22.988
My shrink will say I'm not,
and the judge will flip a coin.

09:24.309 --> 09:27.643
Anything you tell me can be quoted
verbatim in testimony...

09:27.847 --> 09:29.349
...and can affect your case.

09:29.349 --> 09:31.184
You can quote me all you want.

09:31.184 --> 09:32.151
Thank you.

09:34.654 --> 09:36.884
Well, I see that you're a writer.

09:38.324 --> 09:39.916
What do you write about?

09:40.126 --> 09:42.857
Murder, sex, violence.

09:43.063 --> 09:45.293
Do you ever write about yourself?

09:45.499 --> 09:47.467
Not into autobiography.

09:47.668 --> 09:48.999
Really? Why not?

09:49.203 --> 09:53.435
Maybe I like to just sit back and get
other people to reveal themselves.

09:56.277 --> 09:59.110
For instance,
you look a little divorced.

09:59.613 --> 10:01.741
What makes you think I'm divorced?

10:01.950 --> 10:04.043
The ring line hasn't faded.

10:07.188 --> 10:08.712
You're very observant.

10:08.924 --> 10:10.824
Yeah, but am I wrong?

10:11.092 --> 10:13.297
Would it bother you
if you were wrong?

10:13.395 --> 10:15.556
Would it bother you if I was right?

10:20.636 --> 10:23.662
T ell me something you're afraid of.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.837
Boredom.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.116
Is that why you like to take risks?

10:32.882 --> 10:35.146
I do like to take risks.

10:35.351 --> 10:38.651
Like taking drugs and having sex
in a speeding car?

10:38.855 --> 10:41.881
Like talking to me
without having your lawyer present?

10:43.327 --> 10:45.795
Actually, that was your idea.

10:45.996 --> 10:50.194
Like being on trial for murder? That's
risky. You could end up in prison.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.668
Not if I'm innocent.

10:51.668 --> 10:54.233
Innocent people end up in prison
all the time.

10:54.272 --> 10:57.867
Not rich, innocent people who are
represented by Henry Rose.

10:58.076 --> 11:01.307
In that case, it isn't really exciting
unless you're guilty.

11:04.882 --> 11:09.478
Oh, I bet you like to take risks,
don't you, Dr. Glass?

11:09.687 --> 11:12.252
But I'm not the one who's on trial
for murder.

11:12.424 --> 11:13.857
Not yet.

11:20.399 --> 11:22.993
Sorry, you're not allowed
to smoke in here.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.211
You know what I like about you?

11:33.413 --> 11:36.211
You enjoy being in control.

11:42.322 --> 11:43.812
Like me.

11:58.439 --> 12:00.839
Sorry, sir. Can't let you through here.

12:02.009 --> 12:06.310
Well, I would say extremely intelligent.
Gifted, accomplished.

12:06.515 --> 12:08.016
Yet inside, I believe...

12:08.016 --> 12:11.611
...she vacillates between
a feeling of godlike omnipotence...

12:11.820 --> 12:14.618
...and a sense
that she simply doesn't exist...

12:14.823 --> 12:17.018
...which, of course, is intolerable.

12:17.225 --> 12:21.059
Do you consider Miss Tramell to be
mentally impaired?

12:21.263 --> 12:24.199
Not by legal definition, no. Not at all.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.837
If released, is she likely
to commit a violent crime?

12:30.206 --> 12:34.006
I believe her behavior is driven
by what we call a risk addiction.

12:34.544 --> 12:37.919
A compulsive need to prove to herself
that she can take risks...

12:38.114 --> 12:40.229
...and survive dangers others can't.

12:40.349 --> 12:45.344
Especially the subsequent encounters
with the police or the powers that be.

12:45.789 --> 12:47.499
Why would a person do that?

12:47.558 --> 12:51.255
The greater the risk, the greater the
proof of her omnipotence.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.720
Her existence, really.

12:53.931 --> 12:57.458
When you say she has
a risk addiction...

12:57.668 --> 13:00.137
...is this condition likely to get
worse?

13:00.338 --> 13:02.006
All addiction is progressive.

13:02.006 --> 13:04.571
The addict always needs to take
greater risks.

13:04.776 --> 13:07.210
If other people are hurt or killed...

13:07.412 --> 13:10.779
...as a result of her behavior,
that's not likely to stop her?

13:10.982 --> 13:13.507
I think the only thing
that'd stop her....

13:17.790 --> 13:21.157
I suspect the only limit for her
would be her own death.

13:24.363 --> 13:26.888
Then she is a danger to herself.

13:28.434 --> 13:30.197
Yes, I believe she is.

13:37.711 --> 13:40.145
Nice work, Michael. Well done.

13:41.915 --> 13:45.214
Dr. Glass, did Catherine Tramell
kill Kevin Franks?

13:45.418 --> 13:47.852
No, I can't make any comment, sorry.

13:48.054 --> 13:50.420
Can you please tell us about the bail?

13:52.393 --> 13:57.228
Dr. Michael Glass. What a big thing
you are all of a sudden.

13:57.431 --> 14:01.925
What are you doing here, Adam?
Don't say you're writing about Tramell.

14:02.136 --> 14:05.106
A sexy, omnipotent killer
with a Random House contract.

14:05.139 --> 14:06.474
Why would I write that?

14:06.474 --> 14:08.242
You don't know she's a killer.

14:08.242 --> 14:11.838
No, but I hope she is, though.
I mean, I pray to God she is.

14:12.047 --> 14:15.073
By the way, I hear you were
brilliant in there.

14:15.284 --> 14:18.447
You're so lucid sometimes,
it's just disgusting.

14:18.654 --> 14:20.815
You thought about daytime television?

14:21.023 --> 14:24.550
Denise always says you were born
for the small screen.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.456
And how is my wife these days?
Having fun?

14:27.663 --> 14:30.997
Ex-wife, Michael. Ex-wife.

14:31.201 --> 14:33.567
While we're chatting about killers...

14:33.770 --> 14:36.864
...is there any chance of talking about
George Cheslav?

14:37.073 --> 14:38.973
Who told you about Cheslav?

14:39.175 --> 14:40.403
Denise?

14:40.610 --> 14:43.875
That's got to be any shrink's worst
nightmare.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.141
A patient in your care
suddenly runs amok...

14:47.351 --> 14:49.420
...beats his girlfriend to death
with a brick.

14:49.420 --> 14:52.082
That was seven years ago,
why talk about it now?

14:52.289 --> 14:55.281
Not quite seven, actually.
Seven in July.

14:55.492 --> 15:00.452
But you talked to him twice a week.
He never indicated he'd harm the girl?

15:00.664 --> 15:03.098
I don't talk about my patients.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.998
Cheslav's dead. Can't you talk
about them when they're dead?

15:07.205 --> 15:09.901
No, not even when they're dead.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.140
Michael, what are you doing here?

15:40.140 --> 15:43.473
What did you tell Adam T owers
about George Cheslav?

15:43.677 --> 15:45.110
Nothing.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.514
Can you give us a minute?

15:50.050 --> 15:51.642
He already knew.

15:54.554 --> 15:58.116
Really? Because he said you told him.

15:58.326 --> 16:00.419
No, all I said was--

16:00.628 --> 16:04.064
If he writes about that, if he puts it
on his magazine cover--

16:04.265 --> 16:06.425
He won't. You're just being paranoid.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.136
You didn't do anything wrong.

16:08.136 --> 16:12.470
Right. I didn't. I was treating a patient
that killed his pregnant girlfriend.

16:12.674 --> 16:15.576
End of story.
You make sure he gets that.

16:15.778 --> 16:17.143
Don't worry.

16:25.087 --> 16:27.697
I'm up for the Douglas Chair
at the university.

16:27.890 --> 16:31.792
You know what that means to me.
Do you think this is going to help?

16:31.994 --> 16:33.929
I can't tell Adam what to write.

16:33.964 --> 16:34.931
Why not?

16:35.131 --> 16:36.299
Don't be stupid.

16:36.299 --> 16:40.235
I think you're entitled to since you've
been fucking him for over a year.

16:40.437 --> 16:43.372
Do you think I didn't know
when it started?

16:43.573 --> 16:47.100
It's a pity you never asked yourself
why it started.

16:56.454 --> 16:59.321
How was the court case
with the mystery writer?

16:59.557 --> 17:01.222
I hear she looks fabulous.

17:01.325 --> 17:05.159
Also very intelligent.
Pathological liar. Narcissistic.

17:05.363 --> 17:07.661
Seductive, manipulative.

17:07.865 --> 17:10.115
Do you think she killed the footballer?

17:10.202 --> 17:11.369
I have no idea.

17:11.369 --> 17:14.396
Everything she does is so perfectly
composed.

17:14.606 --> 17:17.074
It's designed to confuse
or confound you.

17:17.275 --> 17:21.371
You never know what's truth
and what isn't. She's brilliant, really.

17:21.579 --> 17:23.694
The masked psychotic. Your favorite.

17:23.815 --> 17:27.460
I'm already working it into a paper:
"Risk Addiction and Omnipotence."

17:27.487 --> 17:28.955
You're writing another already?

17:28.955 --> 17:31.491
I'm writing two,
but this is the more interesting.

17:31.491 --> 17:33.186
I'll catch you up.

17:33.393 --> 17:34.690
Hello?

17:34.894 --> 17:38.489
Glass? It's Roy Washburn.
Are you near a television set?

17:38.698 --> 17:41.462
If you'll be quiet, I'll make a
statement.

17:41.667 --> 17:42.792
What happened?

17:42.835 --> 17:44.275
The judge let her go.

17:44.371 --> 17:45.572
Let her go? Why?

17:45.572 --> 17:47.836
The guy who said
he sold her the DTC...

17:48.042 --> 17:51.345
... the judge found out he 'd perjured
himself in another case...

17:51.345 --> 17:55.076
... and disqualified him as a witness.
But I'll make you a bet.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.317
What's that?

17:56.483 --> 17:57.878
She 'll do it again.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.043
And soon.

17:59.253 --> 18:03.247
Only this time
I will fucking nail the bitch.

18:21.110 --> 18:25.376
So we've been considering those who
wish to control others...

18:25.581 --> 18:28.675
...through their insecurity and their
narcissism.

18:28.884 --> 18:33.321
T o study Nietzsche
psychobiographically may seem naive.

18:33.522 --> 18:35.952
Wasn't it Nietzsche's work itself,
which...

18:36.125 --> 18:39.320
...through deconstructive and
post-structuralist readings...

18:39.396 --> 18:41.921
...induced the death of
psychobiography?

18:46.369 --> 18:51.238
Paul Portman said he might go
to T avistock. I'm thinking I might go.

18:51.441 --> 18:54.899
Just be patient.
Stay where you are for about a year.

18:55.112 --> 18:57.809
-But there's nothing holding me.
-Trust me.

18:58.015 --> 18:59.365
You know Dr. Gerst?

18:59.650 --> 19:01.345
Michael Glass.

19:01.552 --> 19:03.315
It's a pleasure.

19:03.654 --> 19:05.918
I saw your review of my book.

19:06.124 --> 19:09.821
You didn't understand what I was
saying about the analytic field.

19:10.027 --> 19:14.192
T owards the end you made one or two
interesting remarks.

19:14.399 --> 19:17.095
Maybe one of these days
we can discuss it.

19:17.536 --> 19:19.834
I'd be honored. Thank you very much.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.235
"One or two interesting remarks"?

19:24.443 --> 19:28.675
That was a compliment, Michelle.
Dr. Gerst was very impressed.

19:28.881 --> 19:32.249
And it appears that our Michael
has just been knighted.

19:33.453 --> 19:34.715
Cheers.

19:36.656 --> 19:38.385
Congratulations.

20:15.463 --> 20:18.432
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

20:19.534 --> 20:24.837
Every day I see you writing and I am
thinking, "What is he writing about?"

20:25.041 --> 20:27.032
Is it a novel?

20:27.677 --> 20:30.043
No, but there was a novelist in it.

20:30.246 --> 20:33.443
Really? Who?

20:33.649 --> 20:36.948
I can't tell you that.
Otherwise I'd have to kill you.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.354
Must be someone famous, then.

20:58.041 --> 21:00.032
Excuse me. Dr. Glass?

21:00.245 --> 21:02.720
I'm Peter Ristedes.
Adam T owers' assistant.

21:03.081 --> 21:05.072
Urbane magazine.

21:07.318 --> 21:09.218
Mind if I join you?

21:09.420 --> 21:14.016
Adam asked me to see if you'd give us
a quote for the article he's writing.

21:14.225 --> 21:16.205
I believe he mentioned it to you.

21:17.495 --> 21:20.522
He didn't seem to think
you'd want to talk to him.

21:27.573 --> 21:30.133
I'll take that as a "no comment," then?

21:47.527 --> 21:49.085
Dr. Glass?

21:51.998 --> 21:53.431
Miss Tramell.

21:54.935 --> 21:56.510
What are you doing here?

21:56.737 --> 21:58.637
I wanted to talk to you.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.636
About the evaluation.

22:01.842 --> 22:06.176
Some of the things you said,
I've been thinking about them a lot.

22:08.683 --> 22:10.981
I'm sorry you had to hear all that.

22:14.556 --> 22:15.921
Got a minute?

22:20.896 --> 22:22.329
Come through.

22:31.374 --> 22:36.641
What you said about me
being addicted to risk...

22:36.846 --> 22:40.043
...about having to do more and more
dangerous things....

22:40.249 --> 22:43.548
Well, after you said it...

22:44.087 --> 22:46.487
...I realized I was...

22:46.689 --> 22:48.214
...scared.

22:49.259 --> 22:50.988
What exactly scared you?

22:53.330 --> 22:57.699
For weeks before the accident
I was having the same...

22:59.002 --> 23:01.766
...fantasy over and over again.

23:03.107 --> 23:05.201
I even wrote about it.

23:05.410 --> 23:10.575
The woman's driving in the car,
the man's making her come.

23:10.782 --> 23:14.513
She drives off the road,
the man's killed.

23:14.853 --> 23:18.289
I feel like maybe I made it all happen.

23:20.125 --> 23:21.990
That's why I'm here.

23:22.193 --> 23:25.095
Are you saying you'd like to
go into treatment?

23:28.033 --> 23:29.091
Yeah.

23:29.301 --> 23:31.701
Well, I think that's a very good idea.

23:33.038 --> 23:37.168
I wouldn't be able to treat you, but I'd
be happy to refer you to a colleague.

23:37.376 --> 23:38.844
Why can't you treat me?

23:38.844 --> 23:42.354
It's not advisable for a doctor who's
done a forensic evaluation...

23:42.516 --> 23:44.684
...to then become that person's
therapist.

23:44.684 --> 23:45.651
Why not?

23:45.852 --> 23:50.289
Therapy requires a great deal of trust,
which is difficult for most people.

23:50.490 --> 23:53.220
It's best to start with a clean slate.

23:53.427 --> 23:55.918
You mean you don't trust me.

23:58.900 --> 24:02.700
What I said about you at the hearing
must have seemed very negative.

24:02.904 --> 24:05.199
I'm sure you've got feelings about that.

24:05.206 --> 24:07.726
I'd be happy referring you
to another doctor.

24:07.975 --> 24:11.604
This is Dr. Milena Gardosh.
She has a clinic here in London.

24:11.813 --> 24:13.610
You want to know the truth?

24:13.815 --> 24:18.515
The reason I agreed to the evaluation
was because I thought it would be fun.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.051
I never....

24:22.024 --> 24:24.584
I never talked to anyone who....

24:40.376 --> 24:41.968
My patient's here.

24:48.618 --> 24:49.923
What do I owe you?

24:50.019 --> 24:52.045
You don't owe me anything.

24:52.256 --> 24:57.159
But if you'd like to call Dr. Gardosh,
I'm sure she can help you.

24:57.361 --> 24:59.352
I don't shop around.

24:59.563 --> 25:02.726
Like you said,
trust is very hard to come by.

25:04.401 --> 25:07.700
I was hoping I might find it with you.

25:11.343 --> 25:15.177
Listen, why don't we
schedule another meeting.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.941
And then we can talk about this
when we're not so rushed.

26:04.499 --> 26:07.935
You look different today. More relaxed.

26:08.336 --> 26:12.602
The more nervous I am,
the more relaxed people think I am.

26:13.675 --> 26:17.304
I wanted to talk about something you
brought up last Wednesday.

26:17.512 --> 26:19.314
You said before the accident...

26:19.314 --> 26:23.251
...you had fantasies of sexual
excitement and driving off the road.

26:23.619 --> 26:26.110
Do you often have fantasies like that?

26:26.322 --> 26:28.187
I have fantasies all the time.

26:29.291 --> 26:33.091
Fantasies involving violence, death?

26:34.697 --> 26:36.272
People die in my novels.

26:36.465 --> 26:39.525
I have to think of new and interesting
ways to kill them.

26:41.471 --> 26:43.996
What happens when
you don't take risks?

26:51.648 --> 26:55.516
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in here.
It's a rule.

26:55.719 --> 26:57.187
I don't like rules.

26:57.388 --> 26:59.863
I have some of them,
and that's one of them.

27:04.562 --> 27:06.792
After the hearing...

27:06.998 --> 27:11.025
...I was interviewed by a reporter
from Urbane magazine.

27:14.505 --> 27:18.135
Adam T owers. He said he knew you.

27:18.343 --> 27:20.140
Slightly. Why?

27:22.114 --> 27:25.174
He told me about the Cheslav case.

27:25.384 --> 27:28.251
I was impressed by what you did.

27:28.453 --> 27:31.752
You knew Cheslav was dangerous.

27:31.957 --> 27:34.188
Still you protected him.

27:35.395 --> 27:37.863
You honored his confidentiality...

27:38.297 --> 27:41.061
...even at risk to yourself.

27:42.568 --> 27:45.401
Do you think you made the right
decision?

27:45.605 --> 27:47.698
Or do you think you fucked up?

27:49.776 --> 27:53.577
Given what I knew at the time,
I made the right decision.

27:55.983 --> 28:00.079
So you still believe in confidentiality.

28:00.521 --> 28:03.957
Within legal limits.
What exactly are you concerned with?

28:10.799 --> 28:14.997
If I told you
that I killed Kevin Franks...

28:15.203 --> 28:17.899
...would you report me to the police?

28:20.775 --> 28:22.140
No.

28:22.343 --> 28:26.644
Anything that happened in the past,
I wouldn't discuss outside this room.

28:29.351 --> 28:33.082
But if you told me you were going to
murder someone specifically...

28:33.289 --> 28:35.553
...and I thought you were serious...

28:35.758 --> 28:38.192
...then, yes, I'd go to the police.

28:39.361 --> 28:43.559
I might be manipulating you
to create risk for myself.

28:47.204 --> 28:49.968
Do you want to talk about
what happened to Kevin?

28:54.277 --> 28:55.938
No, not really.

28:56.146 --> 28:59.013
I was just checking your policy.

29:00.984 --> 29:03.044
So have you decided?

29:04.622 --> 29:07.250
About taking me on as a patient.

29:12.196 --> 29:14.926
Shooter had an ex-wife,
a drinking problem...

29:15.133 --> 29:19.092
...a drug problem, a complicated sex
problem he was barely aware of.

29:19.303 --> 29:22.205
And a tremendous amount of
free-floating rage.

29:22.407 --> 29:26.400
In short, he was a cop
and a very good one.

29:26.612 --> 29:27.827
On March 3rd....

29:27.913 --> 29:30.438
The woman knelt naked
at the foot of the bed.

29:30.649 --> 29:32.879
Her back to him, her head on a pillow.

29:33.085 --> 29:37.420
Shooter raked his fingers through her
blond hair and twisted it tight.

29:37.624 --> 29:39.717
She groaned, her breath catching...

29:39.926 --> 29:44.124
... as he suddenly yanked her hair like
a rider pulling on a horse 's mane.

29:44.330 --> 29:48.994
The veins on his arms bulged as
he roughly drew her onto him.

29:51.137 --> 29:53.765
Do you remember
that cop Washburn?

29:54.140 --> 29:59.374
T o him, the fact that I wasn't upset
about Kevin Franks...

29:59.580 --> 30:02.310
...was proof that I must've killed him.

30:04.084 --> 30:07.178
Then, when I wouldn't break down...

30:07.388 --> 30:09.447
...he hit on me.

30:11.358 --> 30:12.655
Hit on you?

30:12.860 --> 30:13.919
Yeah.

30:14.129 --> 30:17.530
He said that if I fucked him things
would go easier.

30:18.767 --> 30:21.668
Homicide cops
are usually smarter than that.

30:23.205 --> 30:27.073
I knew one once, in San Francisco.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.677
Nick Curran.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.905
They called him Shooter.

30:33.115 --> 30:36.414
We used to get in his car
and ride around...

30:36.619 --> 30:39.816
...listening to 911 calls on his
scanner...

30:40.022 --> 30:41.785
...then speed over.

30:41.991 --> 30:45.552
Have you ever been to a murder scene
right after it happened?

30:49.600 --> 30:51.966
The body's still warm.

30:53.303 --> 30:55.771
The watch is still ticking.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.965
You can smell the blood.

31:00.844 --> 31:03.642
We'd hang around
for a while and then...

31:03.847 --> 31:06.338
...go have sex in Nick's car.

31:11.522 --> 31:13.456
Nick used to say:

31:13.658 --> 31:19.119
"Death is always there.
It's the only thing that's real."

31:19.330 --> 31:22.493
Except maybe sex sometimes.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.295
But only sometimes?

31:25.504 --> 31:27.301
Well...

31:27.640 --> 31:30.837
...I fucked this guy last night.

31:31.043 --> 31:33.204
I fucked him for hours.

31:33.412 --> 31:36.142
You know,
we did everything to each other.

31:37.483 --> 31:42.751
The full screaming Masters
and Johnson's greatest hits.

31:43.223 --> 31:48.718
But you know, a week from now,
I probably won't even remember him.

31:48.929 --> 31:52.763
But, if I was with him when he died....

31:55.368 --> 31:56.596
Now...

31:57.938 --> 32:02.899
...I probably would never forget that.

32:04.946 --> 32:06.140
Would I?

32:07.848 --> 32:10.476
Were you ever with anyone
when they died?

32:14.822 --> 32:15.914
No.

32:17.826 --> 32:19.293
Christ.

32:24.466 --> 32:26.400
We still have 20 minutes left.

32:26.601 --> 32:28.728
I feel like a cigarette.

32:28.937 --> 32:30.632
See you tomorrow.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.135
She just walked out?

32:35.210 --> 32:36.303
How Lacanian.

32:36.512 --> 32:38.309
For her, time's a weapon.

32:38.514 --> 32:41.506
Everything's a weapon.
Everybody's an enemy.

32:42.618 --> 32:46.679
Do you think she made it up about
the policeman? Washburn?

32:46.889 --> 32:50.450
I don't know. It's so hard to believe
anything she says.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.423
She's trying to seduce you.

32:52.628 --> 32:54.654
They always try to seduce you.

32:54.865 --> 32:57.527
Yes, but this one's different, isn't it?

32:58.902 --> 33:01.700
I don't know. More fun maybe.

33:01.905 --> 33:03.896
Be careful, Michael.

33:06.744 --> 33:10.271
By the way, I got a call from that
reporter, Adam T owers.

33:11.649 --> 33:12.909
What did he want?

33:12.984 --> 33:16.647
I made everything sound boring.
I assured him he didn't have a story.

33:16.855 --> 33:19.551
What if he calls others?
What if he calls Gerst?

33:19.758 --> 33:23.854
Gerst won't talk to a popular magazine
reporter. Are you kidding?

33:39.011 --> 33:41.036
Anyway, it was a successful paper.

33:41.213 --> 33:44.003
Published, on this occasion,
under sole authorship.

33:44.116 --> 33:45.777
Well, thank God for that.

33:45.985 --> 33:48.113
Speaking of God, is Gerst coming?

33:48.321 --> 33:50.289
We can only hope and pray.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.651
That he comes or he doesn't?

33:54.094 --> 33:58.656
I'm going for a smoke. Don't talk about
anything interesting till I get back.

34:00.133 --> 34:01.933
How long have you lived here?

34:01.935 --> 34:05.531
About six years, something like that.
Seven.

34:15.817 --> 34:16.851
Hi, Dominic.

34:17.018 --> 34:18.178
Hi, Milena.

34:26.428 --> 34:27.395
Thank you.

34:30.466 --> 34:32.716
The beauty about
antisocial behavior...

34:32.835 --> 34:36.362
...is that it takes you away from other
people, however briefly.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.168
You're not an analyst.

34:42.612 --> 34:43.976
I'm a writer.

34:44.179 --> 34:46.614
Really? What do you write about?

34:46.815 --> 34:50.842
Oh, the lurid, the sexual, the violent.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.748
The basic instincts.

34:53.822 --> 34:56.072
They're the most powerful,
aren't they?

35:08.072 --> 35:09.300
Milena.

35:09.507 --> 35:10.804
Oh, Michael.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.442
I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name.

35:13.644 --> 35:16.808
Catherine Tramell. Milena Gardosh.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.408
Oh, you're Dr. Gardosh.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.645
I've heard so many wonderful things
about you.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.186
Catherine.

35:26.391 --> 35:27.756
There you are.

35:30.595 --> 35:34.259
Milena, Dr. Glass.
I see you've met Catherine.

35:34.467 --> 35:38.927
She's doing research for a novel about
an eminent psychoanalyst.

35:39.138 --> 35:42.107
I thought she might enjoy an occasion
like this.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.675
Well, may I take your coats?

35:48.147 --> 35:49.910
Thank you.

35:50.116 --> 35:51.413
Excuse me.

35:53.854 --> 35:56.254
Would you put that in my pocket?

35:58.025 --> 35:58.992
Certainly.

36:00.894 --> 36:03.294
Catherine, come this way.

36:04.698 --> 36:08.691
What's going on? What was Gerst
thinking of, bringing her here?

36:08.902 --> 36:11.303
I'm sure he's no idea who she is.

36:11.506 --> 36:13.235
Where did he meet her?

36:13.441 --> 36:15.705
She would have met him, believe me.

36:16.744 --> 36:20.373
I can't stay here while I've got
a patient here. I have to go.

36:20.582 --> 36:21.810
I understand.

36:24.385 --> 36:27.310
If you follow inter-subjectivity to its
natural end...

36:27.489 --> 36:30.684
...aren't you asking who's the patient
and who's the doctor?

36:30.859 --> 36:32.724
Those were my very words.

36:32.928 --> 36:34.225
Very good.

36:35.364 --> 36:37.855
Note that one for future reference.

36:47.277 --> 36:49.472
Are you leaving because of me?

36:52.949 --> 36:54.884
You must have known I'd be here.

36:55.051 --> 36:56.882
Is that a problem?

36:57.087 --> 37:00.284
I know some people who play tennis
with their shrinks.

37:00.490 --> 37:01.889
I'm sure you do.

37:02.092 --> 37:06.154
Have sex with them. Sell them drugs.
Work on their screenplays.

37:06.364 --> 37:07.922
But I don't do that.

37:09.166 --> 37:12.897
I was upset about our session today.

37:13.104 --> 37:16.073
I felt I owed you an apology.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.465
That's why I came.

37:20.077 --> 37:22.205
We can go into that tomorrow.

37:22.714 --> 37:24.682
I've got a better idea.

37:24.883 --> 37:28.944
How about I ditch everybody
and we go somewhere for a drink.

37:29.388 --> 37:33.017
I told you, I don't socialize with my
patients.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.790
Another one of your rules?

37:35.994 --> 37:38.360
Don't you get kind of tired of them?

37:38.563 --> 37:41.931
You know, that's the nightmare
of shrinkdom, doctor.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.763
T oo many answers,
too many questions...

37:44.971 --> 37:46.461
...nobody gets laid.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.676
Okay, forget getting laid.

37:56.884 --> 37:58.351
We'll just talk.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.688
We'll talk tomorrow.

38:20.575 --> 38:23.169
Michael. There you are.

38:23.378 --> 38:27.781
Oh, my God. Did you see that woman
that Gerst brought with him?

38:27.982 --> 38:29.244
No.

38:29.451 --> 38:32.113
Actually, I was just looking for you.

38:33.389 --> 38:34.559
What, in there?

38:34.757 --> 38:37.960
I was looking for your coat.
I thought we could go for a drink.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.355
If that's all right?

38:42.031 --> 38:43.828
Yeah. Great.

39:25.209 --> 39:26.871
What's wrong?

39:27.079 --> 39:28.273
Turn around.

39:28.480 --> 39:29.447
What?

39:29.648 --> 39:30.945
Turn around.

40:12.860 --> 40:14.054
Oh, God!

40:15.262 --> 40:19.359
Michael, it's Denise!
Please pick up the phone! Please!

40:19.568 --> 40:22.002
Michael, please pick up the phone!

40:22.204 --> 40:23.637
Denise?

40:24.105 --> 40:26.335
Hey, hey, hey. What's happened?

40:41.457 --> 40:43.254
Thanks, guv.

40:47.530 --> 40:49.521
Come in, Michael.

40:49.732 --> 40:51.324
Hey, you okay?

40:53.936 --> 40:55.734
Hey, what's going on?

40:55.939 --> 40:58.407
It's okay, I'm here now. Okay?

40:58.609 --> 41:00.042
Who lives here?

41:00.244 --> 41:02.041
It's Adam's place.

41:39.051 --> 41:40.245
Jesus.

41:40.819 --> 41:42.514
What happened?

41:42.721 --> 41:47.385
I don't know. The door was unlocked
and I just came in.

41:47.593 --> 41:49.562
I just saw him lying there.

41:52.032 --> 41:53.966
Have you called the police?

41:54.167 --> 41:56.067
No. I was afraid.

42:44.787 --> 42:46.584
Hello, Michael.

42:46.789 --> 42:48.654
What are you doing here?

42:48.858 --> 42:51.122
It's my wife. Well, my ex-wife.

42:51.327 --> 42:54.057
She found him like that,
then she called me.

43:00.471 --> 43:01.699
I see.

43:01.905 --> 43:05.932
And how did she happen to
find him like that?

43:06.977 --> 43:09.707
They'd been seeing each other and....

43:12.082 --> 43:13.549
Oh, really?

43:13.751 --> 43:15.309
Since when?

43:16.720 --> 43:18.484
It's why I moved out.

43:19.991 --> 43:23.688
So I assume you weren't
the best of friends?

43:23.895 --> 43:24.953
No.

43:27.365 --> 43:30.425
Yet I saw you talking to him
after the Tramell hearing.

43:30.635 --> 43:32.435
It was just journalist stuff.

43:32.504 --> 43:35.337
He was asking me questions about
Tramell.

43:35.541 --> 43:37.406
Do you think she killed him?

43:39.045 --> 43:40.103
Who?

43:43.315 --> 43:45.078
Denise? No.

43:45.284 --> 43:47.411
No, not a chance.

43:47.620 --> 43:51.265
I've known her for a long time.
She could never do anything like that.

43:53.226 --> 43:57.287
Listen, Roy, I've told my story twice
over. Is it all right if I go home?

43:58.999 --> 44:00.091
All right.

44:02.669 --> 44:04.159
Oh, by the way...

44:07.007 --> 44:08.167
...this yours?

44:11.746 --> 44:14.715
No, I just found it on the floor.

44:16.184 --> 44:18.516
How did it end up in the rubbish?

44:18.886 --> 44:23.186
I stepped on it. It was leaking.
I just threw it away.

44:26.661 --> 44:28.128
Can I go?

44:31.767 --> 44:33.530
Yes, by all means.

45:37.669 --> 45:40.332
I assume you know Adam T owers
was killed.

45:41.774 --> 45:43.435
Why would I know?

45:43.843 --> 45:46.368
Because of Denise.

45:46.579 --> 45:47.876
Denise?

45:48.080 --> 45:49.655
Your wife. Your ex-wife.

45:49.782 --> 45:52.182
I know who she is.
How do you know her?

45:52.718 --> 45:55.915
Adam introduced us a couple of times.

45:56.122 --> 46:00.150
It was all very open. I knew about her,
she knew about me.

46:00.360 --> 46:01.827
Knew what about you?

46:04.965 --> 46:07.160
That I was seeing him too.

46:08.335 --> 46:10.895
The Masters and Johnson guy.
That was him.

46:11.104 --> 46:14.198
So-- You were sleeping
with Adam T owers?

46:14.741 --> 46:16.573
Occasionally.

46:19.914 --> 46:22.389
So, of course,
Washburn thinks I killed him.

46:22.550 --> 46:24.125
Why would he think that?

46:25.486 --> 46:30.480
I kill because I'm addicted to risk.
Or to prove that I exist.

46:30.692 --> 46:32.360
I'm not sure which one it is.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.329
I never said you killed anybody.

46:34.530 --> 46:35.925
But you think I did.

46:35.998 --> 46:40.799
You think I killed Kevin, and now
you're wondering if I killed Adam.

46:41.003 --> 46:44.700
Why don't you just ask me?
Or is that too direct for you?

46:47.209 --> 46:48.699
Did you kill him?

46:49.678 --> 46:52.978
If I said I didn't,
would you believe me?

46:56.620 --> 46:57.609
Depends.

46:58.088 --> 47:01.854
On what?
The quality of my performance?

47:02.058 --> 47:05.858
You know what?
I'm glad Adam T owers is dead.

47:06.062 --> 47:07.772
And you should be glad too.

47:07.931 --> 47:10.730
If you're too uptight,
I'll be glad for you.

47:10.935 --> 47:13.062
Whoever killed him did you a favor.

47:13.271 --> 47:14.431
Favor?

47:14.705 --> 47:18.971
If he'd written that article on Cheslav,
it would've ruined your career.

47:19.410 --> 47:22.605
You haven't told me if you killed him.
Can you put that out?

47:25.549 --> 47:28.485
Put it out now or you can leave,
okay?!

47:35.761 --> 47:37.092
Is that better?

48:16.170 --> 48:20.004
When you think about fucking me...

48:20.207 --> 48:22.608
...and I know you do...

48:22.811 --> 48:26.474
...how do you picture it, doctor?

48:29.084 --> 48:33.248
Oh, I know you can't answer me,
so just think it.

48:34.389 --> 48:36.220
Do you want it straight up?

48:36.424 --> 48:37.891
You on top?

48:38.093 --> 48:39.527
Me on top?

48:41.297 --> 48:44.061
Do you want it from behind...

48:46.936 --> 48:50.804
...on your knees,
my face in the pillow?

48:52.108 --> 48:54.906
Do you want to beat me up...

48:55.444 --> 48:57.640
...just a little?

48:57.848 --> 48:59.816
Not too hard.

49:01.585 --> 49:04.486
Oh, a little harder than that.

49:07.657 --> 49:10.319
Do you want to come in my mouth?

49:13.130 --> 49:18.364
What if I told you that I masturbate
thinking about you?

49:19.737 --> 49:21.864
That I make myself come...

49:22.073 --> 49:26.203
...thinking about you
making yourself come.

49:36.755 --> 49:39.155
I guess we're out of time for today.

49:49.835 --> 49:51.770
I'm terminating therapy.

49:51.971 --> 49:53.529
Send me the bill.

50:38.019 --> 50:40.385
Are you feeling all right?

51:09.653 --> 51:11.678
Miss Tramell, it's Dr. Glass here.

51:12.256 --> 51:15.453
Listen, I'm concerned about how our
session ended today.

51:15.659 --> 51:18.359
I'd like to talk through
any misunderstandings...

51:18.562 --> 51:20.588
...there might be between us.

51:20.798 --> 51:23.892
As soon as you get this message,
please give me a--

51:25.236 --> 51:27.431
Just call me when you can.

51:27.639 --> 51:29.470
Evening, Dr. Glass.

51:30.508 --> 51:32.100
Could I have a word?

51:32.310 --> 51:34.278
Sure. Upstairs.

51:39.151 --> 51:40.846
Is that German?

51:41.053 --> 51:42.583
Can I get you anything?

51:42.721 --> 51:43.915
No.

51:44.123 --> 51:46.057
So here's a surprise.

51:46.258 --> 51:50.627
Adam Towers had a girlfriend
besides Denise.

51:50.829 --> 51:52.126
Guess who.

51:53.566 --> 51:55.296
Catherine Tramell.

51:56.736 --> 51:58.271
You don't look surprised.

51:58.271 --> 52:00.206
She's a private patient of mine.

52:00.407 --> 52:01.874
I see. Since when?

52:02.075 --> 52:03.133
Not long.

52:04.377 --> 52:09.076
So your ex and your private patient
were both screwing Adam T owers.

52:09.282 --> 52:12.410
That's quite a coincidence.
Did they know each other?

52:12.620 --> 52:15.145
I don't know. I don't think so.
Did you--?

52:17.725 --> 52:22.924
Tramell's prints were all over T owers'
apartment, along with others.

52:23.130 --> 52:27.294
But what's interesting is the last call
he made was to her mobile phone...

52:27.501 --> 52:29.594
...90 minutes before he died.

52:29.804 --> 52:32.307
Her story is she was out walking all
that time.

52:32.307 --> 52:36.107
Two hours strolling around Clerkenwell
and nobody saw her, so....

52:36.311 --> 52:39.280
Come on, Michael. Talk to me.

52:40.349 --> 52:44.217
I can't tell you anything. Even if I
knew something, which I don't.

52:45.754 --> 52:49.782
Franks was first. Towers second.
There's bound to be a third.

52:49.993 --> 52:51.961
This goes beyond confidentiality.

52:51.961 --> 52:55.522
You've got a legal obligation to protect
a potential victim.

52:55.732 --> 52:59.725
You can't lock somebody up because
you think they might do something.

52:59.936 --> 53:03.337
Why don't you tell me what you know
about this article...

53:03.539 --> 53:07.049
...T owers was writing about you
and our old friend George Cheslav.

53:09.413 --> 53:11.663
Who told you
he was writing an article?

53:11.949 --> 53:13.143
His editor.

53:13.350 --> 53:16.410
He'd been very busy.
He had a lot of information on you.

53:18.222 --> 53:20.124
What, and you think I killed him...

53:20.124 --> 53:22.554
...to stop him writing
some stupid article?

53:23.060 --> 53:28.465
No. But just for the record, why don't
you tell me how you spent last night.

53:28.667 --> 53:31.568
Between, say,
7 p.m. and 2 in the morning.

53:31.770 --> 53:34.261
You know, broad strokes.

53:36.808 --> 53:39.174
I had patients until 8 p.m.

53:39.377 --> 53:41.681
Then went to a party
in Collingham Gardens.

53:41.681 --> 53:43.616
I left there about 11 with a woman.

53:43.616 --> 53:47.382
We came here and I was on my knees
fucking her when Denise called.

53:51.724 --> 53:53.453
On your knees, eh?

53:54.660 --> 53:57.720
Sounds like your evening
was better than mine.

53:57.930 --> 54:02.027
Could I get her name?
So there are no loose ends.

54:04.304 --> 54:08.035
Look, Michael, Adam Towers
was fucking your ex-wife...

54:08.241 --> 54:12.575
...and about to do the same
to your career. I've got to ask.

54:17.418 --> 54:18.976
Michelle Broadwin.

54:20.555 --> 54:25.015
She's a psycho-pharmacologist at
Victoria Psychiatric Hospital.

54:28.363 --> 54:29.455
Thank you.

54:31.833 --> 54:33.323
I'll be in touch.

54:38.507 --> 54:39.902
What does that mean?

54:43.512 --> 54:45.104
I smell blood.

55:00.163 --> 55:05.191
Yeah, not all of them, of course, but,
you know, some of them.

55:05.402 --> 55:09.270
They're all so sanctimonious...

55:09.472 --> 55:11.600
...so judgmental.

55:11.809 --> 55:17.304
All my friends, they drink too much.
They snort too much coke.

55:17.515 --> 55:19.949
Miss Tramell,
it's Dr. Glass here again.

55:20.151 --> 55:22.915
I'm a little concerned
I haven't heard from you.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.452
I was wondering whether you're okay.

55:25.656 --> 55:29.684
Look, let me give you
my home number. It's 0207....

55:29.895 --> 55:34.127
Sorry, it really got to me and I don't
know why it seems to be doing that.

55:34.332 --> 55:38.530
Why it's getting worse.
I mean, I was really excited.

55:38.737 --> 55:41.706
You have no new messages.

56:09.002 --> 56:10.902
The thing about Gerst is this:

56:11.104 --> 56:13.902
The selection committee
is just a formality.

56:14.107 --> 56:16.041
This is the real interview.

56:17.778 --> 56:19.541
Relax.

56:19.746 --> 56:22.716
Be direct, candid.

56:22.917 --> 56:25.351
But not too candid.

56:27.489 --> 56:31.357
Very good time. They always get lost
on the way. Come in.

56:31.559 --> 56:33.390
Meet my new Mughal painting.

56:33.595 --> 56:35.358
Not another one.

56:35.563 --> 56:39.761
An Indian goddess at peace. It has a
tranquility to it, don't you think?

56:40.402 --> 56:44.304
I wonder what the males are doing,
loitering so close to her?

56:44.507 --> 56:47.999
It's obvious. They're worshiping her.

56:48.210 --> 56:49.404
As they should.

56:49.812 --> 56:53.339
Perhaps that's why she has eight arms
to fend them off.

56:53.549 --> 56:57.884
Why don't you girls go outside
while Dr. Glass and I have our chat.

56:59.322 --> 57:01.552
Come. Come.

57:02.158 --> 57:05.127
Come with me. You'll enjoy it.

57:09.533 --> 57:12.559
So, Dr. Glass, I have a question:

57:12.969 --> 57:14.732
Do you think I'm insane?

57:16.507 --> 57:17.474
Pardon?

57:18.042 --> 57:20.203
Nuts? Bonkers? Off my trolley?

57:21.012 --> 57:22.707
No, not at all.

57:23.281 --> 57:26.546
But I might be if I recommended you
for the Douglas Chair.

57:28.986 --> 57:30.831
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

57:30.955 --> 57:32.889
George Cheslav.

57:33.525 --> 57:38.622
A major drug dealer, under your care,
brutally murders his girlfriend.

57:38.830 --> 57:40.991
An inquiry is held...

57:41.199 --> 57:44.930
...where Detective Roy Washburn...

57:45.137 --> 57:48.470
...testifies that you acted
professionally at all times.

57:48.674 --> 57:49.875
You're blameless.

57:49.875 --> 57:51.270
That's right, I was.

57:51.945 --> 57:55.676
However, after the trial...

57:55.882 --> 57:59.648
...you experienced what we might term
an emotional meltdown:

57:59.886 --> 58:01.148
Depression...

58:01.354 --> 58:03.515
...occupational underachievement...

58:03.723 --> 58:05.384
...marital problems...

58:05.592 --> 58:09.028
...and questionable professional
conduct...

58:09.229 --> 58:13.131
...much discussed at dinner parties
around our great city.

58:15.536 --> 58:16.594
I'm sorry?

58:17.905 --> 58:20.669
Now you want my support
for the Douglas Chair.

58:25.746 --> 58:27.977
No more Cheslavs, Michael.

58:30.952 --> 58:32.112
No.

58:38.360 --> 58:40.123
No more Cheslavs.

01:00:30.835 --> 01:00:31.860
Catherine!

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:39.206
Sorry. All right.
Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.

01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:56.580
God, Michael, how dramatic.

01:01:56.786 --> 01:01:57.753
I know.

01:01:57.953 --> 01:02:01.720
I thought she was in danger,
but I know that's not the point.

01:02:01.925 --> 01:02:04.085
She could be a murderer twice over...

01:02:04.194 --> 01:02:07.755
...and you're acting like she's a
princess you have to rescue.

01:02:07.998 --> 01:02:10.228
Don't patronize me, please.

01:02:12.002 --> 01:02:13.993
It's driving me crazy.

01:02:16.273 --> 01:02:18.537
You're in love with her, aren't you?

01:02:20.078 --> 01:02:21.943
Not love. It's....

01:02:24.182 --> 01:02:25.615
I don't know.

01:02:30.221 --> 01:02:33.384
You have to terminate this therapy,
right away.

01:02:34.953 --> 01:02:38.116
Well, it's already done.
She terminated it herself.

01:02:38.323 --> 01:02:39.290
Good.

01:02:40.324 --> 01:02:43.418
If she calls again, give her my number.

01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:49.589
I'm a woman.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.633
She'll relate to me differently.

01:03:35.843 --> 01:03:37.811
What are you doing here?

01:03:38.012 --> 01:03:40.207
Where she goes, I go.

01:03:40.414 --> 01:03:41.574
Since when?

01:03:41.782 --> 01:03:45.411
Since she started coming
to your office five days a week.

01:03:48.155 --> 01:03:52.989
So, Adam T owers.
Seems his research has gone missing.

01:03:53.193 --> 01:03:56.185
All his notebooks, audiotapes,
even his hard drive.

01:03:56.396 --> 01:03:59.126
Everything on George Cheslav
and Michael Glass.

01:03:59.332 --> 01:04:01.926
-You think Catherine has it?
-I know she does.

01:04:02.135 --> 01:04:05.536
She ever tell you about them
when she's chatting on the couch?

01:04:05.738 --> 01:04:07.172
You know I can't discuss that.

01:04:07.172 --> 01:04:10.437
Come on. I've been very good to you
these past few years.

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:13.440
I'm practically a psychopath
delivery service.

01:04:13.645 --> 01:04:15.220
I can't break privilege.

01:04:15.414 --> 01:04:18.747
Pity. I have something
you might like to know about.

01:04:18.951 --> 01:04:22.387
Someone says you'd been lying
at the Cheslav inquest.

01:04:22.588 --> 01:04:24.054
Who?

01:04:24.255 --> 01:04:26.849
You want me to break privilege?

01:04:28.292 --> 01:04:31.750
Since you're a friend,
it was your ex-wife.

01:04:31.963 --> 01:04:33.487
Denise?

01:04:33.698 --> 01:04:35.495
You want to sort her out.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:39.659
Who knows, she might tell you
where T owers' notes went.

01:05:01.991 --> 01:05:06.325
Someone's here.
Do you want us to say?

01:05:06.529 --> 01:05:08.929
I'll be all right. Don't worry.

01:05:09.131 --> 01:05:10.689
We'll see you later.

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:15.162
How you doing?

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.031
Okay.

01:05:19.741 --> 01:05:21.136
Do you want a drink?

01:05:21.242 --> 01:05:23.506
No, I have to go.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:26.407
I'm meeting someone
at the Atlantic Bar.

01:05:27.515 --> 01:05:32.384
Denise, did you tell T owers that
I lied at the Cheslav inquiry?

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.914
Of course, there's always an agenda.

01:05:37.124 --> 01:05:41.060
No. I said you knew he was going
to kill his girlfriend.

01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:42.729
I didn't. That's a lie.

01:05:42.729 --> 01:05:43.957
Yes, you did.

01:05:44.164 --> 01:05:48.692
You kept saying how you knew
and should have gone to the police.

01:05:48.902 --> 01:05:53.497
I didn't know. I sensed. And I told you
that as my wife in confidence.

01:05:53.706 --> 01:05:57.699
I didn't think you'd go and repeat it
in bed to some moron reporter.

01:06:00.146 --> 01:06:03.791
Do you want to ruin my life, is that it?
You want to ruin my practice?

01:06:05.051 --> 01:06:08.451
Your life? Your practice?

01:06:08.653 --> 01:06:11.952
Catherine was right,
everything's always about you.

01:06:12.157 --> 01:06:15.251
What about me? Adam's dead
and I'm a murder suspect.

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:19.920
Washburn keeps going on about me
not cooperating, like I'm a liar.

01:06:20.131 --> 01:06:22.246
I don't know where Adam's notes are.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.869
I'm scared to go home. I'm scared
to go out. I'm going out of my mind.

01:06:25.869 --> 01:06:27.371
Be careful about Catherine.

01:06:27.371 --> 01:06:28.939
Don't tell me what to do!

01:06:28.939 --> 01:06:30.107
Just calm down.

01:06:30.107 --> 01:06:32.177
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

01:06:32.343 --> 01:06:33.423
Hey, come on.

01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:36.638
That's my wife, okay?
This is a private conversation.

01:06:36.847 --> 01:06:38.872
Get out of my way! Out of my way!

01:08:43.899 --> 01:08:46.424
Denise. Oh, Denise!

01:08:46.635 --> 01:08:47.932
Come on.

01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:51.029
Come on, come on.

01:08:58.046 --> 01:09:00.675
Come on, Denise. Look at me.

01:09:01.884 --> 01:09:03.316
Call an ambulance!

01:09:03.818 --> 01:09:05.444
Do it now!

01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:08.421
Come on. Let's go.

01:09:09.823 --> 01:09:12.987
Stay with me. Come on. Stay with me.

01:09:14.295 --> 01:09:16.160
Come on. Stay with me.

01:09:49.162 --> 01:09:51.426
You have a problem, Michael.

01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:57.065
Witnesses say they saw you arguing.
She was crying.

01:09:57.269 --> 01:10:00.295
You grabbed her.
She almost fell down.

01:10:00.505 --> 01:10:04.066
Five minutes later,
somebody slits her throat.

01:10:05.911 --> 01:10:09.904
Also, there are people here who think
you killed Towers.

01:10:10.115 --> 01:10:13.481
Towers? Didn't you speak to Michelle?

01:10:13.684 --> 01:10:17.644
Yes. But now I'm hearing about this
cigarette lighter with your prints on it.

01:10:17.655 --> 01:10:18.956
I just picked that up.

01:10:18.956 --> 01:10:23.791
And your ex is in a coma just as she's
to say something inconvenient for you.

01:10:23.994 --> 01:10:25.962
I was trying to save her life.

01:10:30.366 --> 01:10:34.302
Look, I spoke to T owers' assistant
at Urbane magazine.

01:10:34.504 --> 01:10:38.406
He expected Denise to say that you
perjured yourself at Cheslav's inquiry.

01:10:38.608 --> 01:10:40.310
She wasn't going to say that.

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:42.107
What was she going to say?

01:10:48.283 --> 01:10:49.511
Sorry, guv.

01:10:59.528 --> 01:11:01.120
You wait there.

01:11:58.683 --> 01:11:59.911
So....

01:12:01.452 --> 01:12:06.617
Your ex and Catherine Tramell
were girl buddies. Did you know that?

01:12:07.959 --> 01:12:09.984
What do you mean "girl buddies"?

01:12:10.194 --> 01:12:14.721
According to Catherine,
they met through Towers and hit it off.

01:12:18.268 --> 01:12:21.508
Denise told Catherine that T owers had
been pressuring her...

01:12:21.605 --> 01:12:24.403
...into saying that you'd perjured
yourself.

01:12:24.608 --> 01:12:28.544
But Denise wasn't having it.
She was going to say you were clean.

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:33.578
You didn't know Cheslav was going to
kill his girlfriend, did you?

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:36.406
In fact, it came
as a complete surprise, didn't it?

01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:43.764
-Of course she's lying.
-How do you know?

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:48.057
Everything that comes out of her is a
lie. Even the truth's a lie with her.

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:51.499
It's her way of getting you to think
what she wants you to think.

01:12:51.499 --> 01:12:53.794
That's her art. The art of mind-fucking.

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:55.792
She might be a talented writer.

01:12:55.837 --> 01:12:59.102
When it comes to mind-fucking,
she's the all-time genius.

01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:04.603
She really got to you, didn't she?

01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:11.042
What do you mean?
What did she tell you about me?

01:13:11.585 --> 01:13:14.145
Well, what is there to tell?

01:13:14.355 --> 01:13:18.257
Don't play games with me.
She can pull it off, you can't.

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:24.025
Where are you going?

01:13:24.063 --> 01:13:28.022
Someplace else. Unless
you have evidence to charge me.

01:13:29.302 --> 01:13:30.530
Do you?

01:13:32.505 --> 01:13:34.132
I didn't think so.

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:14.971
He let you go, finally.

01:14:15.179 --> 01:14:16.702
I was worried.

01:14:17.714 --> 01:14:20.911
You lied to Washburn for me. Why?

01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:23.981
I knew you hadn't hurt Denise.

01:14:24.187 --> 01:14:26.678
How could you know that?

01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:29.825
Because I know you.

01:14:30.026 --> 01:14:33.688
And I know the cops were keeping you
just to play some kind of game.

01:14:33.896 --> 01:14:36.296
What, like getting me
to talk about you?

01:14:36.498 --> 01:14:41.401
Yeah, but you wouldn't do that,
because you're into confidentiality.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.631
Why were you meeting with Denise?

01:14:47.142 --> 01:14:49.770
Research for my novel.

01:14:50.179 --> 01:14:51.509
Research.

01:14:51.713 --> 01:14:52.839
About what?

01:14:53.047 --> 01:14:54.776
About you.

01:14:54.982 --> 01:14:57.951
And Cheslav, the masked psychotic.

01:15:00.988 --> 01:15:04.515
The analyst in my book is obsessed
with that sort of thing.

01:15:06.527 --> 01:15:09.495
Washburn thinks
that you slit Denise's throat.

01:15:11.131 --> 01:15:14.589
Me? You're the one that hated her.

01:15:14.801 --> 01:15:17.827
Maybe I'm acting out
your unconscious impulses.

01:15:18.105 --> 01:15:19.367
Stop it!

01:15:22.442 --> 01:15:26.605
Do you think it's possible that
you want me to be the killer?

01:15:26.812 --> 01:15:31.181
You know, how some guys
are into blonds...

01:15:31.383 --> 01:15:33.749
...and some guys are into killers.

01:15:35.387 --> 01:15:37.142
Isn't that what you're into?

01:15:40.326 --> 01:15:42.886
Isn't that what turns you on?

01:15:45.263 --> 01:15:46.628
Turns me on?

01:15:51.269 --> 01:15:53.635
Isn't that why you're over here?

01:16:36.678 --> 01:16:37.702
Okay.

01:16:38.914 --> 01:16:40.506
I trust you.

01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:43.317
You trust me.

01:18:05.362 --> 01:18:07.762
Is there somewhere we can talk?

01:18:07.964 --> 01:18:09.397
Over there.

01:18:24.713 --> 01:18:26.482
Can I guess where you got it?

01:18:26.482 --> 01:18:28.417
Let's find out what it is first.

01:18:28.517 --> 01:18:33.079
It would be highly improper of me to
accept any evidence in this fashion.

01:18:33.289 --> 01:18:34.483
Fine.

01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:38.056
It'll take me a few days
to get it analyzed.

01:18:38.259 --> 01:18:41.160
You'd have made a good cop, Michael.

01:18:41.362 --> 01:18:43.626
You like the smell of blood.

01:18:52.173 --> 01:18:54.198
Dr. Glass.

01:18:54.409 --> 01:18:56.205
Hold on.

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:59.140
I was just thinking about you.

01:18:59.346 --> 01:19:02.747
I might have more
psychiatric evaluations for you.

01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:05.245
That's nice, but I'm busy
at the moment.

01:19:05.719 --> 01:19:10.247
Oh, that's a pity.
You were so good with Catherine.

01:19:10.457 --> 01:19:13.755
She tells me you're very perceptive.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.360
She's very perceptive herself.

01:19:19.799 --> 01:19:24.634
I hope Detective Washburn isn't giving
you cause for...

01:19:24.837 --> 01:19:26.099
...concern?

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.964
What do you mean?

01:19:29.175 --> 01:19:31.768
Well, given his past record.

01:19:34.813 --> 01:19:36.371
What past record?

01:20:39.007 --> 01:20:40.530
I want to talk to you.

01:20:40.741 --> 01:20:42.538
Oh, so now you want to talk.

01:20:42.743 --> 01:20:46.702
Look, this "Dirtiest Cop in London,"
it doesn't mention him by name.

01:20:46.914 --> 01:20:50.441
But this "Detective X,"
is that Roy Washburn?

01:20:53.421 --> 01:20:55.048
Is it Washburn?

01:20:56.123 --> 01:20:57.453
Excuse me?

01:21:01.494 --> 01:21:03.325
Yeah, it's him.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.892
Are you sure?

01:21:08.101 --> 01:21:12.197
Adam may have been a sloppy writer,
but he had excellent sources.

01:21:12.405 --> 01:21:16.807
What about perjury, intimidation,
falsifying evidence. Is that true?

01:21:17.009 --> 01:21:18.844
A policeman fabricating evidence.

01:21:18.844 --> 01:21:20.112
But you have proof?

01:21:20.112 --> 01:21:23.240
How about Kevin Franks
and the Case of the Killer Orgasm?

01:21:23.449 --> 01:21:26.734
When I did Catherine Tramell's
assessment, I read that report.

01:21:26.819 --> 01:21:29.515
Those syringes found in the car
contained DTC.

01:21:29.721 --> 01:21:32.883
Yeah, well, who found
the syringes in the car?

01:21:33.091 --> 01:21:35.116
But why would Washburn do that?

01:21:35.326 --> 01:21:37.862
Adam thought he did it to set up
Catherine Tramell.

01:21:37.862 --> 01:21:39.662
Why didn't he write about it?

01:21:42.633 --> 01:21:44.294
That's the whole point.

01:21:45.336 --> 01:21:47.099
He was going to.

01:21:48.239 --> 01:21:49.933
Then he got killed.

01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:16.824
I owe you an apology.
About Roy Washburn. I--

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.562
I don't like apologies.

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:26.362
I also don't like people stealing things
from my apartment.

01:22:29.043 --> 01:22:33.503
The insulin? In case you haven't had it
analyzed yet.

01:22:34.782 --> 01:22:35.749
Insulin?

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.850
My friend's diabetic.

01:22:38.052 --> 01:22:40.680
Let yourself out, doctor.

01:23:36.207 --> 01:23:37.697
Hello, Michael.

01:23:41.212 --> 01:23:42.472
What do you want?

01:23:42.479 --> 01:23:44.413
I got the lab analysis back.

01:23:44.615 --> 01:23:48.142
D-Tubocurarine. Funny that.

01:23:49.954 --> 01:23:51.754
You're sure it's not insulin?

01:23:52.255 --> 01:23:53.779
Insulin?

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:55.116
No.

01:23:55.325 --> 01:23:57.384
Can I see the report?

01:23:59.128 --> 01:24:03.724
You've got some trust issues there.
You might want to work on that.

01:24:12.941 --> 01:24:16.672
This isn't an official
Forensic Services report.

01:24:16.878 --> 01:24:21.645
No. Because an unpreserved or
contaminated chain of evidence...

01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:27.151
...will be deemed inadmissible
in a future trial, Inspector Clouseau.

01:24:28.456 --> 01:24:30.976
So do you want to tell me
where you found it?

01:24:36.764 --> 01:24:38.129
She's not worth it.

01:24:38.332 --> 01:24:41.130
People are dying
and I will have her for it.

01:24:41.335 --> 01:24:43.900
If you stand in my way,
I'll have you as well.

01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:46.038
I can fucking promise you that.

01:24:50.944 --> 01:24:53.742
I've got something to show you.
Get in the car.

01:24:57.217 --> 01:24:58.514
Get in!

01:25:14.233 --> 01:25:16.599
Medical examiner's on his way.

01:25:30.815 --> 01:25:32.248
Hello, guv.

01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:43.618
Were you working that night?

01:25:43.827 --> 01:25:45.795
No, I don't know.

01:25:46.997 --> 01:25:50.660
Did you see or hear
anything suspicious yesterday?

01:25:50.867 --> 01:25:52.527
Not yesterday. No.

01:25:52.735 --> 01:25:55.101
-Nothing?
-No.

01:25:55.304 --> 01:25:57.006
How long have you worked here?

01:25:57.006 --> 01:25:58.405
Four months.

01:25:58.607 --> 01:25:59.869
Four months?

01:26:01.043 --> 01:26:02.977
Where were you before that?

01:26:08.117 --> 01:26:09.084
T ed.

01:26:09.285 --> 01:26:10.410
Hi, guv.

01:26:10.618 --> 01:26:13.485
--remember I talked to Vice earlier and
they said--

01:26:13.688 --> 01:26:15.417
Fergie, give me a minute.

01:26:15.623 --> 01:26:16.715
Let's go.

01:26:37.478 --> 01:26:39.002
Who is he?

01:26:39.213 --> 01:26:43.946
Richard Pepovic.
Known to his friends as Dickie Pep.

01:26:47.453 --> 01:26:48.852
You know him?

01:26:49.055 --> 01:26:50.488
No.

01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:52.282
Look at this.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.468
Now, we'll have to wait for the lab
results, of course...

01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:10.107
...but what's the betting he's oozing
Tubocurarine?

01:27:12.277 --> 01:27:15.178
Now do you want to tell me
who gave you the sample?

01:27:21.285 --> 01:27:23.150
You don't know she did it.

01:27:24.355 --> 01:27:25.447
No.

01:27:27.491 --> 01:27:31.154
But then again, maybe I killed him.

01:27:32.196 --> 01:27:34.356
Isn't that what she's gonna tell you?

01:27:34.365 --> 01:27:36.660
He had something on me,
so I killed him.

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:39.634
Then I jerked him off
even though he was dead...

01:27:39.836 --> 01:27:42.372
...to make it look like
there was come everywhere...

01:27:42.372 --> 01:27:44.442
...to make it look like it was her.

01:27:47.177 --> 01:27:52.205
Look, Towers was right about me,
I put them away whatever it takes.

01:27:52.415 --> 01:27:54.780
So, fine, don't trust me.

01:27:54.983 --> 01:27:57.008
You know Catherine better than me.

01:27:57.186 --> 01:27:59.655
If you have five seconds
when you're not dizzy...

01:27:59.655 --> 01:28:03.113
...with the smell of her pussy,
ask yourself: Do you trust her?

01:28:04.626 --> 01:28:05.752
Do you?

01:28:11.366 --> 01:28:15.267
She's George Cheslav, times three.
We both know it.

01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:17.765
The question is:
How do we put her away?

01:28:17.872 --> 01:28:22.241
If you tell the courts that she's made a
direct threat against someone....

01:28:22.443 --> 01:28:23.613
But she hasn't.

01:28:23.778 --> 01:28:26.941
If you say she did, and that got her put
on a psych ward...

01:28:27.148 --> 01:28:30.388
...stopped her from killing again,
wouldn't that be worth it?

01:28:30.517 --> 01:28:34.180
Some kind of redemption
for Cheslav at last?

01:28:37.824 --> 01:28:40.816
Look, I'm prejudiced.

01:28:41.027 --> 01:28:43.359
Don't take my word for it.

01:28:44.664 --> 01:28:46.461
T alk to this guy.

01:28:51.036 --> 01:28:52.731
Listen to him.

01:29:18.496 --> 01:29:21.090
Lieutenant Walker. It's Michael.

01:29:21.299 --> 01:29:23.323
Look, thanks for talking to me.

01:29:23.534 --> 01:29:26.833
It's just that I did an evaluation
of Miss Tramell....

01:29:35.045 --> 01:29:39.276
Darkness had fallen and even before
the buzzer sounded...

01:29:39.482 --> 01:29:42.713
...Kelly knew it would be the doctor.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:46.047
He'd come to accuse her
of more crimes.

01:29:46.255 --> 01:29:48.746
They'd fight about that
and then have sex...

01:29:48.958 --> 01:29:51.449
... and everything would be
all right again.

01:29:51.661 --> 01:29:53.281
Except it wouldn 't be...

01:29:53.462 --> 01:29:55.453
... if he didn 't trust her.

01:30:31.397 --> 01:30:32.557
H i, handsome.

01:30:32.966 --> 01:30:34.433
My new novel.

01:30:34.634 --> 01:30:37.262
I' m anxious to hear
what you think about it.

01:30:38.605 --> 01:30:41.267
I've been speaking
to Lieutenant Phil Walker...

01:30:41.474 --> 01:30:44.238
...the San Francisco
Police Department.

01:30:44.444 --> 01:30:49.244
Paranoid Phil.
Now there's a blast from the past.

01:30:49.448 --> 01:30:53.942
He said you murdered a Johnny Boz
and two detectives in San Francisco.

01:30:54.152 --> 01:30:56.416
I was never even charged.

01:30:56.622 --> 01:31:00.217
Grand jury said that Nick Curran's
girlfriend did it.

01:31:02.628 --> 01:31:06.688
I'm going to take a Jacuzzi.
Care to join me?

01:31:12.637 --> 01:31:16.971
All right, all right.
I killed Johnny Boz.

01:31:17.174 --> 01:31:18.368
Why?

01:31:18.576 --> 01:31:20.771
I didn't like him.

01:31:20.978 --> 01:31:22.878
For the money.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.673
To see if I could get away with it.

01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:31.150
To show that death
really isn't very important.

01:31:31.354 --> 01:31:32.787
Because I was bored.

01:31:32.989 --> 01:31:35.480
And you know how I hate being bored.

01:31:35.692 --> 01:31:37.489
What about Denise, huh?

01:31:37.694 --> 01:31:38.888
Adam T owers?

01:31:39.095 --> 01:31:41.324
Adam was insufferable.

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:43.623
And you are something special.

01:31:44.867 --> 01:31:49.566
Adam was trying to ruin you just
out of spite, and I couldn't bear it.

01:31:51.407 --> 01:31:53.136
This is wonderful.

01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:00.409
Denise.

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:04.645
Denise.... Denise was good in bed.

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:08.344
Denise would have spoiled
everything I'd accomplished...

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.524
...by killing Adam Towers.

01:32:11.693 --> 01:32:14.856
God, you can't tell the truth
about anything, can you?

01:32:16.997 --> 01:32:19.591
You don't believe me
when I say I did it.

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.769
You don't believe me
when I say I didn't do it.

01:32:22.969 --> 01:32:25.995
What is the point
of talking to you, anyway?

01:32:29.643 --> 01:32:31.372
Oh, come on.

01:32:33.813 --> 01:32:36.873
Why don't you take your clothes off
and get in, huh?

01:32:48.994 --> 01:32:52.622
This is worse than Cheslav, isn't it?

01:32:52.831 --> 01:32:56.528
This time you knew
right from the start what I was.

01:32:58.636 --> 01:33:01.969
And you let it happen again,
didn't you?

01:33:03.475 --> 01:33:06.933
It's almost like you
killed them yourself.

01:33:15.753 --> 01:33:18.620
Who do you think
I'm going to kill next?

01:33:23.961 --> 01:33:25.689
Come on.

01:33:25.895 --> 01:33:28.625
You can figure it out.

01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:24.036
Kelly met the analyst during her little
stay at Holloway Prison.

01:35:25.342 --> 01:35:28.674
His eyes were
a beautiful shade of blue.

01:35:28.878 --> 01:35:31.346
Did Kelly trust the doctor?

01:35:31.547 --> 01:35:34.744
Did she mean it
when she told him she wanted help?

01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:36.941
Even she wasn 't sure.

01:35:37.152 --> 01:35:39.746
If things went well,
then she meant it.

01:35:39.955 --> 01:35:41.422
If not, she didn 't.

01:35:41.624 --> 01:35:43.469
That way, she 'd be protected.

01:35:43.592 --> 01:35:45.827
She remembered the first time
she met Irena...

01:35:45.827 --> 01:35:47.395
... at the party in Bloomsbury.

01:35:47.395 --> 01:35:49.697
She felt a deep affinity
for the older woman.

01:35:49.697 --> 01:35:53.067
As if the two of them leaning against
the wall, silently smoking....

01:35:53.067 --> 01:35:55.169
The next time they saw each other...

01:35:55.169 --> 01:35:57.599
... only brought
the two women even closer.

01:35:57.705 --> 01:36:00.241
Even as Dr. Green watched them
through the window...

01:36:00.241 --> 01:36:02.491
... looking for any sign of conspiracy.

01:36:02.676 --> 01:36:05.975
Kelly found herself opening up,
trusting the older woman...

01:36:06.179 --> 01:36:08.384
... revealing things about herself....

01:36:08.515 --> 01:36:10.915
Yes, Kelly thought. She liked Irena.

01:36:11.118 --> 01:36:15.646
She was trustworthy, intelligent,
beautiful, dignified.

01:36:15.856 --> 01:36:20.292
It was a pity
Kelly was going to have to kill her.

01:36:35.141 --> 01:36:37.005
She dressed carefully.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:40.735
She liked to be well-dressed
when she killed.

01:36:40.946 --> 01:36:44.746
Killing Irena and telling Dr. Green
she was planning to do it...

01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:47.919
... that was the riskiest thing
she could do.

01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:51.813
Come on, Milena.

01:36:55.993 --> 01:36:58.188
Come on, Milena, answer the phone

01:36:59.964 --> 01:37:04.196
It's Michael Glass here. Can you call
me as soon as you get this message?

01:37:05.636 --> 01:37:08.161
As much as Kelly hated her shrink...

01:37:08.372 --> 01:37:11.170
...she also loved him.

01:37:11.375 --> 01:37:15.242
She took a last glance at herself
in the mirror.

01:37:15.445 --> 01:37:20.280
Irena deserved a good death.
And Kelly would give it to her.

01:37:20.483 --> 01:37:23.543
Hello, this is Roy Washburn,
please leave a message.

01:37:23.753 --> 01:37:27.189
Roy. It's Michael Glass.
Come as soon as you can.

01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:30.881
23 Highgate Street. Hampstead.

01:37:31.093 --> 01:37:35.257
I think Catherine is going to kill
Milena Gardosh.

01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:47.234
It was almost midnight by the time
Dr. Green got to Hampstead.

01:38:03.524 --> 01:38:04.514
What is it?

01:38:04.691 --> 01:38:07.683
Thank God.
Listen, we don't have much time.

01:38:07.894 --> 01:38:10.639
You're in danger.
She's going to try and kill you.

01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:12.923
What? Who's trying to kill me?

01:38:13.333 --> 01:38:14.527
Catherine.

01:38:18.838 --> 01:38:21.362
I thought I could help her
but I was wrong.

01:38:21.573 --> 01:38:25.304
I'll try and get her sectioned.
It's the only thing that'll stop her.

01:38:26.512 --> 01:38:28.605
I've already spoken to Catherine.

01:38:32.718 --> 01:38:35.414
She's very upset. You terrified her.

01:38:36.989 --> 01:38:41.118
I terrified her? She's a murderer.
She's already admitted it.

01:38:41.325 --> 01:38:43.987
For chrissake,
you had sex with your patient.

01:38:44.195 --> 01:38:46.493
You assaulted her.
She nearly drowned.

01:38:48.733 --> 01:38:52.760
You've broken the law, not to mention
the ethical canon of our profession.

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:54.238
It wasn't like that.

01:38:54.238 --> 01:38:56.364
Michael, listen to me, please.

01:38:56.573 --> 01:38:58.370
You're not well.

01:38:59.643 --> 01:39:01.488
You're the one who needs help.

01:39:05.949 --> 01:39:07.712
I've spoken to Gerst...

01:39:07.918 --> 01:39:12.548
...and he thinks that if you volunteer
for a 28-day observation...

01:39:12.756 --> 01:39:15.724
...you might be able to avoid
criminal charges.

01:39:16.959 --> 01:39:21.453
However, they will have to
revoke your license.

01:39:22.498 --> 01:39:23.556
I'm sorry.

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:26.066
She's right.

01:39:26.502 --> 01:39:29.062
It's for your own good, Michael.

01:39:34.576 --> 01:39:37.238
She asked me
to take over her treatment.

01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.548
She's my patient now.

01:39:42.984 --> 01:39:44.349
Please, don't.

01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:50.656
You've no idea what
you're getting into.

01:39:52.426 --> 01:39:53.825
T ell her the truth.

01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:57.863
T ell her the truth.

01:40:00.033 --> 01:40:02.013
I'll make you tell her the truth.

01:40:07.039 --> 01:40:08.063
God.

01:40:09.642 --> 01:40:10.631
Come on.

01:40:17.316 --> 01:40:19.682
She's right, you know.

01:40:19.886 --> 01:40:22.650
You really do need help.

01:40:28.727 --> 01:40:29.785
Bitch.

01:40:35.367 --> 01:40:37.096
So, what's this about?

01:40:39.337 --> 01:40:40.531
Protection.

01:40:40.938 --> 01:40:42.803
Oh, yeah? From who?

01:40:45.543 --> 01:40:46.942
Washburn.

01:40:51.248 --> 01:40:52.613
Go ahead.

01:40:57.521 --> 01:41:01.149
Kelly Lash kills Irena,
Dr. Green's colleague.

01:41:01.357 --> 01:41:03.325
No, I read your book.

01:41:03.526 --> 01:41:07.189
So you just rushed right over here
to save her?

01:41:07.397 --> 01:41:11.663
It's just a story, doctor.
Or maybe I really am omnipotent.

01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:19.271
Congratulations,
the control freak finally lets go.

01:41:19.474 --> 01:41:23.479
This is what you wanted from the start,
wasn't it? T o ruin me, to fuck me up!

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:26.705
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:41:28.884 --> 01:41:34.378
No more "I should've stopped Cheslav
from killing his girlfriend."

01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:37.854
No more whining over nothing.

01:41:38.226 --> 01:41:40.922
-It wasn't over nothing.
-Yes, it was.

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:44.256
Cheslav did not kill his girlfriend.

01:41:45.333 --> 01:41:47.062
Washburn did.

01:41:48.903 --> 01:41:50.131
Washburn?

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:54.330
What do you think Adam Towers was
writing about when he was killed?

01:41:54.841 --> 01:41:59.141
You're lying.
You're a lying fucking bitch.

01:41:59.346 --> 01:42:02.873
Sure I am,
if it makes it easier for you.

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:08.409
Why? Why would he kill
the girlfriend?

01:42:10.856 --> 01:42:12.881
To nail Cheslav.

01:42:23.769 --> 01:42:25.326
That's right.

01:42:26.738 --> 01:42:28.638
Your seven years of hell.

01:42:29.874 --> 01:42:31.671
Your meltdown.

01:42:31.876 --> 01:42:33.571
Your divorce.

01:42:35.146 --> 01:42:39.947
Just so your good friend Roy
could nail a drug dealer.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.255
Don't take it so hard.

01:42:52.462 --> 01:42:55.954
Even Oedipus
didn't see his mother coming.

01:43:03.406 --> 01:43:05.601
It's Roy Washburn.

01:43:07.443 --> 01:43:09.911
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

01:43:10.313 --> 01:43:11.575
Fuck off!

01:43:11.781 --> 01:43:16.275
Give me the gun! He knows I've got
Towers' notes. He wants me dead.

01:43:16.485 --> 01:43:18.418
Open the door!

01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:21.088
He's going to kill me
and say you did it.

01:43:21.656 --> 01:43:25.217
No. No, this is all fucked up.

01:43:25.427 --> 01:43:29.488
You don't know what you're doing.
Give me the gun. He's going to kill me.

01:43:29.698 --> 01:43:31.029
You--!

01:43:35.035 --> 01:43:36.764
Go ahead, then, baby.

01:43:52.819 --> 01:43:55.652
Whatever she told you, she's lying.

01:43:58.691 --> 01:44:00.158
Kill her!

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.885
It's the only chance you've got.

01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:40.857
Let go of the gun!

01:44:41.065 --> 01:44:42.498
Clear the weapon!

01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:45.031
-Stay still!
-Get off me!

01:44:45.235 --> 01:44:47.829
Stop struggling! Stop struggling!

01:44:48.037 --> 01:44:52.064
Stay down! I'm telling you
to stay down. Okay?! Stay down!

01:44:52.509 --> 01:44:53.999
Get the cuffs on him.

01:44:55.378 --> 01:44:57.313
-Call an ambulance!
-Keep still!

01:44:57.347 --> 01:44:59.372
Call an ambulance!

01:45:10.359 --> 01:45:11.917
Stay down!

01:45:40.387 --> 01:45:42.878
Calm down! Calm down!

01:45:43.089 --> 01:45:44.852
Nighttime! Nighttime!

01:45:45.058 --> 01:45:46.753
You'll be home soon.

01:46:13.418 --> 01:46:14.851
Hello, Michael.

01:46:20.825 --> 01:46:22.690
I brought you a present.

01:46:25.296 --> 01:46:29.698
I know you read an earlier draft.
But you gave me a better ending.

01:46:31.668 --> 01:46:32.793
So, thank you.

01:46:45.015 --> 01:46:47.574
Would you like me to tell you the plot?

01:46:52.788 --> 01:46:54.756
It's about an American.

01:46:55.992 --> 01:46:57.323
A blond.

01:46:57.527 --> 01:46:59.188
A novelist.

01:46:59.395 --> 01:47:02.455
People around her just keep dying.

01:47:02.665 --> 01:47:04.291
But the question is:

01:47:04.499 --> 01:47:06.091
Who's killing them?

01:47:07.702 --> 01:47:12.366
Is the beautiful blond novelist
a serial killer?

01:47:14.075 --> 01:47:16.373
Or is it the crooked cop?

01:47:17.679 --> 01:47:19.374
Her analyst isn't sure.

01:47:19.748 --> 01:47:23.183
But he goes crazy trying to find out.

01:47:24.418 --> 01:47:26.545
But that's just half the story.

01:47:26.754 --> 01:47:28.051
There's a twist.

01:47:30.224 --> 01:47:35.127
You see, the novelist
never really killed anybody.

01:47:35.329 --> 01:47:37.695
And neither did the cop.

01:47:37.898 --> 01:47:40.923
The real killer all along...

01:47:41.134 --> 01:47:42.897
...was the shrink.

01:47:58.784 --> 01:48:01.912
Yeah, from the moment he saw her...

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:06.489
...he knew she was the smoke screen
he was looking for.

01:48:10.362 --> 01:48:13.195
His best opportunity to get even.

01:48:16.133 --> 01:48:17.327
First...

01:48:18.536 --> 01:48:22.700
...he'd deal with that scumbag
journalist.

01:48:24.809 --> 01:48:29.041
You see, you don't just go around
stealing another man's wife.

01:48:32.382 --> 01:48:33.849
It's humiliating.

01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:43.916
Not that she was a complete innocent.

01:48:44.127 --> 01:48:45.992
That weekend slut.

01:48:48.198 --> 01:48:53.328
Jesus, how could she
let that sleazebag touch her?

01:48:59.508 --> 01:49:00.873
It's hurtful.

01:49:02.778 --> 01:49:06.076
And there's some hurts
you don't just get over.

01:49:11.252 --> 01:49:12.617
Jealousy.

01:49:16.591 --> 01:49:19.822
Jealousy can make us do crazy things.

01:49:29.703 --> 01:49:31.762
But getting away with it...

01:49:35.475 --> 01:49:37.636
...that was genius.

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:42.439
"Unfit to stand trial. "

01:49:43.849 --> 01:49:46.909
No prison for him,
just a happy ending...

01:49:47.286 --> 01:49:52.656
...in a quiet, sunlit, peaceful
psychiatric institute.

01:50:00.432 --> 01:50:04.391
Of course, that could all be a fiction.

01:50:06.971 --> 01:50:09.599
He might really be insane.

01:50:43.172 --> 01:50:45.072
Come back soon, baby.

01:50:47.477 --> 01:50:49.069
I miss you.
