00:02.336 --> 00:04.630
Jamie needs a change.

00:02.336 --> 00:04.630
I want to do it!

00:04.672 --> 00:06.256
No way!

00:04.672 --> 00:06.256
We're supposed to take turns!

00:06.298 --> 00:09.050
Mom told us Jamie swallowed

00:06.298 --> 00:09.050
one of her diamond earrings.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.845
Whoever finds it

00:09.092 --> 00:10.845
when it comes out

00:10.886 --> 00:11.887
gets a 20-buck reward.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.054
Let Reese change this one.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.640
He hasn't gotten to in a while.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.933
Oh, man.

00:15.975 --> 00:17.225
Somehow they never noticed

00:17.267 --> 00:19.060
that Mom doesn't own

00:17.267 --> 00:19.060
any diamond earrings.

00:19.102 --> 00:23.064
Smells like my ticket

00:19.102 --> 00:23.064
to Easy Street.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.146
Every year,

01:01.603 --> 01:03.146
for the last five years,

01:03.188 --> 01:05.190
we've spent a week in a cabin

01:03.188 --> 01:05.190
on a lake.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.608
This year it got ruined,

01:06.650 --> 01:08.443
and we had to come back

01:06.650 --> 01:08.443
three days early.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.571
All I'm saying is

01:08.485 --> 01:10.571
I don't ask for much.

01:10.612 --> 01:14.115
Once a year I want to sit on

01:10.612 --> 01:14.115
a porch, stare at a bug zapper

01:14.157 --> 01:16.035
and make s'mores

01:14.157 --> 01:16.035
over a trash can.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.912
The problem is

01:16.076 --> 01:17.912
the boys have gotten soft.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.622
God forbid they should have a

01:17.953 --> 01:20.622
little interaction with nature.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.458
ALL (screaming):

01:20.664 --> 01:23.458
Leeches! Leeches! Leeches!

01:23.500 --> 01:25.044
(screaming)

01:25.084 --> 01:28.923
I blame video games.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.091
LOIS:

01:30.173 --> 01:32.091
What's going on?

01:36.179 --> 01:38.057
Sorry, folks,

01:36.179 --> 01:38.057
street's closed.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.433
We live here.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.433
What is this?

01:39.474 --> 01:41.100
You live here and

01:39.474 --> 01:41.100
you don't know?

01:41.142 --> 01:42.269
It's the annual block party.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.773
Annual?

01:42.310 --> 01:45.773
Every year for the

01:42.310 --> 01:45.773
last five years.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.110
Oh, hey, Mort.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.862
What's going on?

01:51.904 --> 01:53.154
Oh, Hal.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.740
You're back early.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.617
What is all this?

01:54.782 --> 01:56.617
Why didn't we know about it?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.410
Well, we came out

01:56.658 --> 01:58.410
this morning,

01:58.452 --> 02:01.038
the sun was shining,

01:58.452 --> 02:01.038
people started talking.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.123
It was a spur-of-

02:01.080 --> 02:03.123
the-moment thing.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.541
The banner says

02:03.164 --> 02:04.541
"5th annual."

02:05.667 --> 02:07.086
Huh.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.420
You guys throw a block party

02:08.462 --> 02:10.171
every year when we go away?

02:10.213 --> 02:11.966
You know, I'm not consulted

02:10.213 --> 02:11.966
about the scheduling.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.759
There's a whole committee

02:12.007 --> 02:13.759
that takes care of...

02:13.801 --> 02:15.135
Oh, but I'm boring you.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.313
Polly, yeah, we got home early.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.189
Listen, would it be okay

02:26.354 --> 02:28.189
if we walked over

02:28.231 --> 02:30.067
and dropped off Jamie

02:28.231 --> 02:30.067
for a couple hours?

02:30.109 --> 02:32.945
There's a block party here,

02:30.109 --> 02:32.945
and we wanted to enjoy it.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.738
Okay, great. Thanks.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.239
Enjoy it?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.533
Doesn't anyone

02:36.281 --> 02:38.533
besides me get it?

02:38.575 --> 02:40.119
The whole neighborhood hates us.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.203
So much that they throw

02:40.160 --> 02:42.203
a giant celebration

02:42.245 --> 02:43.204
just because we're gone.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.790
Malcolm, that's not news.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.333
I'm just surprised

02:44.832 --> 02:46.333
they're so organized.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.543
It doesn't bother you

02:46.374 --> 02:48.543
that everyone despises us?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.879
No. These people need somebody

02:48.585 --> 02:50.879
to be mad at.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.547
Having us to hate

02:50.921 --> 02:52.547
gives the whole neighborhood

02:52.589 --> 02:53.924
something to bond over.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.174
HAL:

02:53.966 --> 02:55.174
Your mother's right, son.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.802
Communities seek out

02:55.216 --> 02:56.802
a common enemy.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.219
If it wasn't us,

02:58.261 --> 03:00.305
they'd all team up

02:58.261 --> 03:00.305
against someone else.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.099
Probably a minority.

03:02.141 --> 03:04.225
Malcolm, you can't spend

03:02.141 --> 03:04.225
your whole life worrying

03:04.267 --> 03:06.145
about what people

03:04.267 --> 03:06.145
think about you.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.896
They'll like you,

03:06.185 --> 03:07.896
they'll hate you,

03:07.938 --> 03:10.482
they'll think whatever they want

03:07.938 --> 03:10.482
to think, and then you die.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.984
Is that supposed to cheer me up?

03:12.026 --> 03:13.610
I don't know why

03:12.026 --> 03:13.610
you need cheering up.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.737
You are a teenage boy

03:13.652 --> 03:15.737
with a block party

03:15.779 --> 03:17.196
right outside his door.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.907
Now, you can stay in here

03:17.238 --> 03:18.907
and sulk if you want to,

03:18.949 --> 03:20.534
but your father and I

03:18.949 --> 03:20.534
are gonna go have a good time.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.910
HAL:

03:20.575 --> 03:21.910
Come on, honey.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.746
Oh, my God,

03:21.952 --> 03:24.746
it's a lawnmower parade.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.249
Hey, Otto.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.543
What's this?

03:29.584 --> 03:31.336
It's called a mount.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.006
It is an artificial

03:31.378 --> 03:34.006
cow's hindquarters.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.423
This will allow us

03:35.465 --> 03:38.218
to extract precious seed

03:35.465 --> 03:38.218
from Bruno.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.263
He cost me a fortune,

03:42.305 --> 03:44.766
but there is gold

03:42.305 --> 03:44.766
in those schlapels.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.268
Can't we just let him

03:44.808 --> 03:47.268
go out and mount the heifers?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.521
No, Bruno is much too rough

03:47.310 --> 03:49.521
for my girls.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.857
They have lived

03:49.563 --> 03:51.857
very sheltered lives.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.569
Most of them are even

03:51.899 --> 03:55.569
embarrassed by the milking.

03:55.610 --> 03:59.198
I'm gonna have to be the one

03:55.610 --> 03:59.198
to work this, aren't I?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.532
It is not as bad as you think.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.660
All you have to do

04:00.574 --> 04:03.660
is climb inside.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.287
Bruno will mount you,

04:03.702 --> 04:06.287
offer his shwarzencaufin,

04:06.329 --> 04:07.873
you will extract the seed.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.043
That's a million times worse

04:07.915 --> 04:11.043
than I thought!

04:11.085 --> 04:12.211
Oh, now, Francis.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.337
There's nothing to be afraid of.

04:14.379 --> 04:18.508
Hmm, I wonder why you have

04:14.379 --> 04:18.508
to wear goggles.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.970
(upbeat music plays)

04:22.012 --> 04:23.555
(cheering)

04:23.597 --> 04:27.308
Let's hear it

04:23.597 --> 04:27.308
for Ms. Michaelson's class!

04:27.350 --> 04:31.271
I think I speak for all of us

04:27.350 --> 04:31.271
on Maple and Jefferson

04:31.312 --> 04:33.314
when I say that the neighborhood

04:31.312 --> 04:33.314
gets a lot nicer

04:33.356 --> 04:34.482
this time of year!

04:34.524 --> 04:36.651
(cheering)

04:40.363 --> 04:42.657
(kids laughing)

04:43.700 --> 04:44.701
(chuckles)

04:44.743 --> 04:46.494
(laughing)

04:51.541 --> 04:53.919
No, no, go ahead. Keep going.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.796
We were done anyway.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.756
Yeah.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.594
You know, I never really

05:00.300 --> 05:02.594
thought about us

05:02.636 --> 05:05.430
being the most hated people

05:02.636 --> 05:05.430
in the neighborhood.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.391
Well, Dewey, most people

05:05.472 --> 05:08.391
go through life unnoticed.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.393
Their names are

05:08.433 --> 05:10.393
never in the paper,

05:10.435 --> 05:12.479
they've got no laws

05:10.435 --> 05:12.479
named after them.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.274
That's fine for most

05:12.520 --> 05:15.274
people, but I wanted more.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.358
Hey!

05:15.315 --> 05:17.358
(yell in fear)

05:19.402 --> 05:20.946
It's not always easy.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.698
You don't make a lot of

05:20.988 --> 05:23.698
friends being unpopular.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.077
Someday we'll all get

05:23.740 --> 05:27.077
even with you, Reese!

05:28.745 --> 05:30.247
Huh.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.665
What is it?

05:31.706 --> 05:35.376
That kid just gave me the

05:31.706 --> 05:35.376
best idea of my life.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.378
You know, we don't do

05:35.418 --> 05:37.378
this often enough,

05:37.420 --> 05:38.964
just walk around

05:37.420 --> 05:38.964
the neighborhood.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.383
It's nice, isn't it?

05:42.425 --> 05:44.928
Remind you of another

05:42.425 --> 05:44.928
fair 20 years ago?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.387
(both chuckling)

05:46.429 --> 05:49.933
You spent $70 to win me

05:46.429 --> 05:49.933
a three-dollar stuffed animal.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.685
Well, they make those hoops

05:49.975 --> 05:51.685
too small on purpose.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.352
If I hadn't played

05:51.726 --> 05:53.352
till I won,

05:53.394 --> 05:55.272
they never would've

05:53.394 --> 05:55.272
learned their lesson.

05:55.314 --> 05:59.193
Besides, I wasn't trying

05:55.314 --> 05:59.193
to win the stuffed animal.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.153
I was trying to win you.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.403
Oh, Hal.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.532
ED:

06:02.445 --> 06:05.532
I urge you all to stay calm

06:05.573 --> 06:09.368
and try to enjoy

06:05.573 --> 06:09.368
the fair anyway.

06:09.410 --> 06:13.581
Otherwise, they and their

06:09.410 --> 06:13.581
awful children will have won!

06:13.623 --> 06:15.000
Daddy, let's go!

06:15.042 --> 06:16.375
I'm coming, honey.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
Oh. Let me help you.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
Oh, you don't have

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
to do that.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.465
I don't mind.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.465
I'm glad to do it.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.758
Well, thanks.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.468
That was very nice of you.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.803
Really?

06:26.845 --> 06:29.931
Is there anything else

06:26.845 --> 06:29.931
I can do for you?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.518
I'm just saying, kids

06:31.474 --> 06:33.518
should not be blamed

06:33.560 --> 06:35.103
for how terrible

06:33.560 --> 06:35.103
their parents are.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.147
I mean, if Saddam

06:35.145 --> 06:37.147
Hussein had a son...

06:37.189 --> 06:38.732
Well, maybe that's

06:37.189 --> 06:38.732
not the best example,

06:38.773 --> 06:39.983
but you know what I'm...

06:40.025 --> 06:42.443
Son, I don't care

06:40.025 --> 06:42.443
what anybody says.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.446
You're a very nice

06:42.485 --> 06:45.446
and thoughtful young man.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.490
Thanks.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.952
I'm really glad I met you!

06:52.246 --> 06:53.580
WOMAN:

06:52.246 --> 06:53.580
Hey!

06:53.621 --> 06:54.831
What are you doing?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.457
Huh?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.457
Who was that man?

06:56.499 --> 06:57.542
What do you mean?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.586
Oh, my God!

06:57.584 --> 06:59.586
We've been robbed!

07:07.052 --> 07:09.304
And you just stood there

07:07.052 --> 07:09.304
while he robbed us?

07:09.346 --> 07:10.471
I was walking past.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.472
He needed help.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.557
You helped him?

07:12.599 --> 07:13.767
He was sweating.

07:13.808 --> 07:14.976
And you just believed him

07:15.018 --> 07:16.353
when he said

07:15.018 --> 07:16.353
that this was his house?

07:16.395 --> 07:18.188
No! He didn't say that...

07:18.230 --> 07:20.481
exactly.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.481
I mean, it was implied.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.482
I have a lot on my mind.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.734
Oh, you are from

07:21.524 --> 07:22.734
that family

07:22.776 --> 07:23.985
in that house,

07:22.776 --> 07:23.985
aren't you?

07:24.027 --> 07:25.486
Yes, but I'm not like them!

07:25.528 --> 07:27.322
Do you even realize

07:25.528 --> 07:27.322
what you've done?

07:27.364 --> 07:28.448
What were you thinking?

07:30.158 --> 07:34.955
(crying):

07:30.158 --> 07:34.955
I just wanted somebody

07:30.158 --> 07:34.955
to like me.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.376
(crying)

07:40.585 --> 07:43.797
(man imitates songbird)

07:43.838 --> 07:46.674
(man imitates owl hooting)

07:46.716 --> 07:49.136
(cheering)

07:49.177 --> 07:51.430
Thank you, Jim.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.140
Now, coming up

07:51.471 --> 07:53.140
in just a few minutes

07:53.181 --> 07:55.516
we have our fifth annual

07:53.181 --> 07:55.516
kielbasa eating contest,

07:55.558 --> 07:57.436
sponsored by Stavis Brothers,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.813
the kielbasa

07:57.477 --> 07:59.813
that makes you go "Mmm!"

07:59.854 --> 08:02.190
A kielbasa eating contest?

08:02.232 --> 08:03.775
I remember a certain

08:02.232 --> 08:03.775
pigtailed girl

08:03.817 --> 08:05.735
who could pack away

08:03.817 --> 08:05.735
a dozen king-sized.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.528
That was

08:05.777 --> 08:07.528
a long time ago, Hal.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.157
Oh, come on, Lois.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.992
A woman reaches her

08:10.198 --> 08:11.992
gastronomic peak

08:12.033 --> 08:13.160
at about just your age.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.828
I'll sign up with you.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.538
Unless... you're

08:14.869 --> 08:17.538
afraid I'll beat you.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.375
Hal, you're good

08:17.580 --> 08:20.375
at a lot of things,

08:20.417 --> 08:21.918
but this is kielbasa.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.544
Let's go.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.548
It's either a lizard

08:25.380 --> 08:27.548
or a baby alligator.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.550
It's been in our cesspool

08:27.590 --> 08:29.550
for a month.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.844
I think he lives on poo.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.553
Where is it?

08:32.595 --> 08:33.596
Hello, everyone.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.182
(all gasping)

08:35.223 --> 08:36.724
Don't worry, if I

08:35.223 --> 08:36.724
wanted to beat you up,

08:36.766 --> 08:38.935
you'd all be hanging by

08:36.766 --> 08:38.935
your underpants by now.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.355
I've gathered you here

08:38.977 --> 08:41.355
to make you an offer.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.564
What kind of offer,

08:41.396 --> 08:43.564
Reese?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.817
I'm glad you

08:43.606 --> 08:45.817
asked, Dewey.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.568
It's no secret

08:45.859 --> 08:47.568
that I've tortured

08:47.610 --> 08:48.820
all of you over the years.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.780
Some of you have scars

08:50.822 --> 08:52.657
on the outside.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.660
Some of you are damaged

08:55.702 --> 08:56.828
in places we can't see.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.163
(squeaky

08:56.870 --> 08:58.163
whimper)

08:58.205 --> 08:59.831
Each one of you wants revenge.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.082
And you know what?

09:01.124 --> 09:02.834
You're entitled to it.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.505
Gee, Reese,

09:03.793 --> 09:06.505
revenge sounds great.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.589
But how

09:06.546 --> 09:08.589
could we accomplish that?

09:08.631 --> 09:09.966
Another good question, Dewey.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.385
For 20 bucks,

09:11.426 --> 09:12.760
I'll let each one of you

09:12.802 --> 09:15.596
beat the hell out

09:12.802 --> 09:15.596
of me for 30 seconds.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.516
(murmuring)

09:17.557 --> 09:19.309
Boy, Reese, this is tempting.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.769
But how do we know

09:19.351 --> 09:21.769
you won't let us hit you today,

09:21.811 --> 09:23.688
but then get even

09:21.811 --> 09:23.688
with us tomorrow?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.399
That's the beauty part.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.275
I'll be tied up

09:25.440 --> 09:27.275
and blindfolded

09:27.317 --> 09:29.610
the whole time

09:27.317 --> 09:29.610
you're beating me.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.778
Wow.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.490
The line will form at

09:30.820 --> 09:33.490
the garage in one hour.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.325
I'm not gonna tell you

09:33.532 --> 09:35.325
how to get the money.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.536
Your mothers all have purses.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.619
Except for you, Freddy.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.663
Your mother wears

09:38.661 --> 09:40.663
a travel belt.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.624
Ah.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.294
Is everything good to go?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.546
I think so.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.630
How do you plan to work her?

09:49.672 --> 09:51.091
What do you mean, "work her"?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.467
Well, you know,

09:52.509 --> 09:53.634
you will sit there,

09:53.676 --> 09:55.887
waiting for Bruno

09:53.676 --> 09:55.887
to become fersploten

09:55.929 --> 09:58.557
and enter

09:55.929 --> 09:58.557
the artificial hoonincootz.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.642
And then maybe

09:58.598 --> 10:01.642
you rock the hips a little bit.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.104
Maybe you tease him

10:01.684 --> 10:04.104
with the tail.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.482
Gosh.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.151
I hope this is

10:07.524 --> 10:10.151
sturdy enough

10:10.193 --> 10:12.028
to take his weight.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.654
You know,

10:12.070 --> 10:13.654
he weighs 4,000 pounds.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.740
And when his passion

10:13.696 --> 10:15.740
is aroused,

10:15.782 --> 10:17.825
he may come down

10:17.867 --> 10:20.287
with crushing force!

10:17.867 --> 10:20.287
(loud banging)

10:20.870 --> 10:23.290
I want a raise.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.666
Yeah.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.668
All right.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.670
(sobbing)

10:29.712 --> 10:31.672
Would you try and calm down,

10:29.712 --> 10:31.672
please?

10:31.714 --> 10:34.301
(crying):

10:31.714 --> 10:34.301
It's not just the neighborhood.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.094
It's the whole world.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.095
And the way people

10:37.137 --> 10:38.472
treat each other.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.098
I mean, why does it have

10:38.513 --> 10:40.098
to be like this?

10:40.140 --> 10:43.560
There's just so much hate.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.772
What about pulling Reese's hair?

10:47.814 --> 10:49.566
No, his head will be covered.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.359
Look, you're

10:49.608 --> 10:51.359
thinking too hard.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.570
Just let your hatred tell

10:51.401 --> 10:53.570
your body what to do.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.696
How are we doing?

10:55.738 --> 10:57.157
So far 23 kids have signed up.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.700
We've taken in $460!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.536
Oh, my God!

11:01.578 --> 11:02.703
Just remember,

11:01.578 --> 11:02.703
we've gotta save 20 bucks

11:02.745 --> 11:04.080
for the cab ride

11:02.745 --> 11:04.080
to the hospital.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.749
I'm gonna get the crap

11:04.122 --> 11:06.749
kicked out of me for money.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.712
This is the greatest

11:07.750 --> 11:11.712
nation on Earth.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.216
It's a beautiful day

11:13.756 --> 11:15.216
in the neighborhood

11:15.258 --> 11:17.385
as we begin

11:15.258 --> 11:17.385
our fifth annual

11:17.427 --> 11:20.013
Stavis Brothers

11:17.427 --> 11:20.013
kielbasa eating contest.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.017
I try to line

11:21.640 --> 11:24.017
them up like one

11:21.640 --> 11:24.017
continuous dog.

11:24.058 --> 11:27.228
It's the space between kielbasas

11:24.058 --> 11:27.228
that tells your body it's full.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.229
With us this year

11:28.271 --> 11:31.566
we have our old

11:28.271 --> 11:31.566
friends, Louie...

11:31.608 --> 11:33.568
Gerry...

11:33.610 --> 11:34.735
Jackson...

11:34.777 --> 11:35.736
Lois and Hal...

11:35.778 --> 11:36.904
(no applause)

11:36.946 --> 11:38.739
...and last

11:36.946 --> 11:38.739
year's champion,

11:38.781 --> 11:40.741
Big Tony.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.952
(cheering)

11:42.994 --> 11:45.288
And eaters-- take your marks.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.708
(dings)

12:13.732 --> 12:16.027
(crying)

12:19.989 --> 12:21.740
Are you going to be okay?

12:24.619 --> 12:26.371
He's going

12:24.619 --> 12:26.371
to be fine now.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.415
(dramatic sobbing)

12:32.877 --> 12:34.837
Hey!

12:34.879 --> 12:35.838
I'm in a hurry.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.841
I'm getting a beating

12:35.880 --> 12:38.841
in 15 minutes.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.801
What do you want

12:38.883 --> 12:40.801
for all of this?

12:40.843 --> 12:41.636
What?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.846
I'll take

12:41.678 --> 12:43.846
every piece of candy

12:43.888 --> 12:45.473
that you've got.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.727
Get out of the way!

12:48.767 --> 12:50.811
Let me get you a bag for that.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.523
I don't need a bag.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.654
But I would like

12:59.696 --> 13:01.239
to hear you sing.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.823
Well, ladies

13:01.281 --> 13:02.823
and gentlemen,

13:02.865 --> 13:05.744
we've lost Gerry

13:02.865 --> 13:05.744
and Jackson.

13:05.784 --> 13:06.911
Louie's put

13:05.784 --> 13:06.911
away six.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.829
But he has a

13:06.953 --> 13:08.829
long way to go

13:08.871 --> 13:10.831
to catch up with

13:08.871 --> 13:10.831
Hal and Big Tony,

13:10.873 --> 13:13.501
who've eaten

13:10.873 --> 13:13.501
nine apiece.

13:14.793 --> 13:15.754
Oh, just a minute.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.548
Lois has eaten

13:15.794 --> 13:18.548
nine, too.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.509
You're magnificent.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.057
And we just lost Louie.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.017
Looks like

13:28.099 --> 13:30.017
it's down to three.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.770
Unbelievable.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.770
What is it?

13:31.810 --> 13:35.523
Hal and Lois are

13:31.810 --> 13:35.523
matching Big Tony

13:31.810 --> 13:35.523
dog for dog.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.778
ED:

13:36.566 --> 13:39.778
Oh, wait a minute.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.571
Is this the end

13:39.818 --> 13:41.571
of the road for Lois?

13:42.614 --> 13:47.868
Hmm? No, I just want

13:42.614 --> 13:47.868
more sauerkraut.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.287
(cheering)

13:53.166 --> 13:54.459
(sniffling)

13:54.501 --> 13:55.585
Listen, kid, could you

13:54.501 --> 13:55.585
please just go home?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.712
Is there a

13:55.627 --> 13:57.712
problem here?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.673
It's all right, officer.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.673
We can handle it.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.882
There was a robbery,

13:59.714 --> 14:01.882
and I helped.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.050
We're not

14:01.924 --> 14:03.050
pressing charges.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.927
We'd just like to forget

14:03.092 --> 14:04.927
about the whole thing.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.596
You still have to come down

14:04.969 --> 14:06.596
to the station

14:06.638 --> 14:07.472
and fill out some forms.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.889
You know, looking

14:07.514 --> 14:08.889
through the house,

14:08.931 --> 14:09.890
I don't think

14:08.931 --> 14:09.890
he got much.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.309
Just a bunch of

14:09.932 --> 14:11.309
junk from the garage.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.060
Yeah. It's pretty hard

14:11.351 --> 14:13.060
even to say what was taken.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.688
I can tell you.

14:14.729 --> 14:15.772
I have a photographic memory.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.357
I can picture

14:15.814 --> 14:17.357
everything I put in the car.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.108
How would it be if we

14:17.398 --> 14:19.108
just phoned you later?

14:19.150 --> 14:21.902
There were nine boxes--

14:19.150 --> 14:21.902
14 by 12 by 21.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.112
A computer

14:23.154 --> 14:25.906
and two high-definition

14:23.154 --> 14:25.906
color printers.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.409
A signature machine,

14:25.948 --> 14:28.409
an embossing machine,

14:28.451 --> 14:29.619
two bottles

14:29.661 --> 14:31.538
of solvent-based ink eradicator.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.955
Three reams

14:31.579 --> 14:32.955
of linen-textured

14:32.997 --> 14:35.916
cotton paper with fluorescent

14:32.997 --> 14:35.916
security fibers,

14:35.958 --> 14:38.127
which you could use

14:35.958 --> 14:38.127
to counterfeit money,

14:38.169 --> 14:41.005
but for that you wouldn't need

14:38.169 --> 14:41.005
an embossing machine,

14:41.047 --> 14:44.050
unless you were going to forge

14:41.047 --> 14:44.050
stock certificates.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.971
Oh, my God, you're criminals!

14:49.013 --> 14:51.307
(Richard and Dottie

14:49.013 --> 14:51.307
chuckling nervously)

14:51.349 --> 14:53.934
And you know what

14:51.349 --> 14:53.934
the saddest part is?

14:53.976 --> 14:56.396
I used to care

14:53.976 --> 14:56.396
what you thought about me.

14:58.064 --> 14:58.939
Actually,

14:58.981 --> 15:01.025
I still do

14:58.981 --> 15:01.025
care a little.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.944
(crowd chanting):

15:02.026 --> 15:03.944
Go! Go! Go! Go!

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
ED:

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
this is astonishing.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.115
Last year's record

15:05.988 --> 15:08.115
is shattered.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.617
I can feel it.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.327
I know there's a two-and-

15:09.659 --> 15:11.327
a-half-inch empty pocket

15:11.369 --> 15:13.120
next to my

15:11.369 --> 15:13.120
right kidney. Whoo.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.623
(crowd chanting):

15:13.162 --> 15:15.623
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

15:15.665 --> 15:16.791
(sympathetic groans)

15:16.833 --> 15:21.838
Oh, my God, Big Tony's

15:16.833 --> 15:21.838
down for the count!

15:21.880 --> 15:23.757
Well, it's down

15:23.798 --> 15:25.007
to Hal and Lois now!

15:25.049 --> 15:28.135
(cheering)

15:28.177 --> 15:30.971
You are going down, honey.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.015
We'll see, dear.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.984
All right,

15:41.691 --> 15:43.984
you all know the rules.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.904
You each get 30 seconds.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.531
Absolutely no weapons

15:45.945 --> 15:48.531
of any kind.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.330
All right,

15:53.661 --> 15:56.330
let me go see if he's ready.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.044
Reese, it's time to start.

16:02.086 --> 16:05.298
Here's our first

16:02.086 --> 16:05.298
secret, anonymous customer.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.258
(whispering):

16:05.339 --> 16:07.258
It's Bobby Marcovitch.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.015
(grunting)

16:15.057 --> 16:16.183
Not so hard!

16:16.225 --> 16:17.811
Don't hurt my brother!

16:17.852 --> 16:19.186
(grunting)

16:19.228 --> 16:21.940
Okay, you, your time is up.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.317
Hey!

16:24.358 --> 16:26.694
Reese, what are you doing

16:24.358 --> 16:26.694
up there?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.028
Who's this?

16:28.070 --> 16:29.280
Some kid I found on the street.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.448
I don't know his name.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.908
Chad.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.660
Sorry, man.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.328
How could you hit me like that?

16:35.369 --> 16:37.037
You're my brother.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.289
And my partner.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.249
And you didn't pay!

16:43.586 --> 16:45.672
(gears whirring)

16:53.137 --> 16:54.096
(all gasping)

16:54.138 --> 16:56.098
BOBBY:

16:54.138 --> 16:56.098
Let's get him!

16:56.140 --> 16:59.018
(yelling)

17:04.106 --> 17:05.065
No, wait, wait!

17:05.107 --> 17:06.066
You guys are cheating!

17:42.729 --> 17:43.897
(turns off music)

17:43.938 --> 17:46.065
Send him out to graze.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.110
Hey, look at this.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.739
It says we're supposed

17:50.152 --> 17:52.739
to smear on cow pheromones.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.741
They're supposed

17:52.780 --> 17:54.741
to make him crazy.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.409
No wonder he isn't into it.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.497

It's been quite a day

18:18.222 --> 18:19.933
in competitive

18:18.222 --> 18:19.933
sausage eating.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.225
I think both

18:19.974 --> 18:21.225
Hal and Lois

18:21.267 --> 18:23.143
are approaching

18:21.267 --> 18:23.143
the 21 mark.

18:23.185 --> 18:26.397
(cheering)

18:26.439 --> 18:28.983
It's an amazing

18:26.439 --> 18:28.983
spectacle.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.150
Two great competitors

18:30.192 --> 18:33.696
pushing each other to greater

18:30.192 --> 18:33.696
and greater heights.

18:35.573 --> 18:38.034
What's going on?

18:38.076 --> 18:39.243
Oh, my God!

18:39.285 --> 18:41.161
They're cheering for my family.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.581
I mean, it's for a totally lame

18:41.203 --> 18:43.581
and ridiculous reason,

18:43.623 --> 18:46.125
but they're cheering.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.552
This is unprecedented.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.553
There's only one

18:57.595 --> 19:00.180
kielbasa left,

18:57.595 --> 19:00.180
and it's on

18:57.595 --> 19:00.180
Hal's plate.

19:00.222 --> 19:03.101
The title is his

19:00.222 --> 19:03.101
if he can finish it.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.853
(crowd chanting):

19:03.142 --> 19:05.853
Hal! Hal! Hal! Hal!

19:10.399 --> 19:12.151
(crowd gasping)

19:27.667 --> 19:29.168
(crowd cheering)

19:30.294 --> 19:33.881
(crowd chanting):

19:30.294 --> 19:33.881
Lois! Lois! Lois! Lois!

19:37.343 --> 19:40.429
(crowd gasping)

19:40.471 --> 19:43.474
(crowd cheering)

19:48.521 --> 19:50.898
(crowd groans sympathetically)

19:51.691 --> 19:52.900
You know,

19:52.942 --> 19:56.236
you think you've imagined

19:52.942 --> 19:56.236
every possible ending...

19:56.278 --> 19:57.905
(sobbing)

19:57.947 --> 20:01.117
How could we have been

19:57.947 --> 20:01.117
so wrong about them?

20:01.159 --> 20:03.703
They're good, good people.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.081
Do you feel strange

20:03.744 --> 20:07.081
not hating Hal

20:03.744 --> 20:07.081
and Lois anymore?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.833
My God, I love living here.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.250
It's a great

20:08.875 --> 20:10.250
neighborhood.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.250
Yeah.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.545
I'm sorry I wasn't

20:10.292 --> 20:12.545
able to help

20:10.292 --> 20:12.545
with that noise

20:12.586 --> 20:13.546
Friday night.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.255
Did that music ever stop?

20:15.297 --> 20:16.340
Wait. You're the one

20:16.382 --> 20:18.509
who called the police

20:16.382 --> 20:18.509
on my party?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.178
You had a party and

20:18.551 --> 20:20.178
you didn't invite me?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.261
Oh, don't do that.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.263
Why are you

20:21.303 --> 20:23.263
such a big baby?

20:23.305 --> 20:24.765
Don't you call him

20:23.305 --> 20:24.765
a baby.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.559
At least I don't have

20:24.807 --> 20:26.559
to ask him

20:26.600 --> 20:28.477
to mow his lawn

20:26.600 --> 20:28.477
every two weeks.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.770
Well, from what I hear,

20:29.812 --> 20:31.522
he's been mowing  your

20:29.812 --> 20:31.522
lawn, if you get what...

20:31.564 --> 20:33.315
Don't you talk

20:31.564 --> 20:33.315
to her like that!

20:33.357 --> 20:34.901
Hey, hey, hey...

20:33.357 --> 20:34.901
The hell with you!

20:34.942 --> 20:36.276
The hell with  you!

20:36.318 --> 20:38.237
(everybody yelling)

20:57.965 --> 20:59.299
Honey,

20:57.965 --> 20:59.299
there's no line

20:59.341 --> 21:00.801
for the giant slide.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.011
Oh, that's okay, dear.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.304
I'm just going to lie down

21:02.053 --> 21:04.304
here on the pavement.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.557
Okay.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.557
(groaning)

21:06.599 --> 21:07.725
Well, I guess Mom was right.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.601
We were serving a purpose

21:08.642 --> 21:10.644
in the neighborhood

21:08.642 --> 21:10.644
all these years.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.231
DEWEY:

21:11.229 --> 21:13.231
Hey, Reese, want to help me

21:13.272 --> 21:14.648
fill up the moon bounce

21:13.272 --> 21:14.648
with this?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.567
Nah. I'm going to go

21:14.690 --> 21:16.567
put dogs on the Ferris wheel.
