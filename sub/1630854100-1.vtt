Big man. That thing
healed nicely.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.809
Guess we can't call you
one-eyed Willy no more.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.645
Yeah but it still hurts a little
when I blink too hard,

00:11.679 --> 00:14.648
from the stress fractures.
- Why would you ever need
to blink that hard Jarvis?

00:14.682 --> 00:17.151
Just blink normal like the
rest of us and you good.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.587
Aye, look, look.

00:19.620 --> 00:25.293
I know you a man of few words,
and we already moved past our
little situation, but uh...

00:25.859 --> 00:28.829
I don't know if I ever
truly said thank you.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.832
- For what?
- For picking up the phone
that night.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.835
For bailing me out.
- It was a private number.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.838
If I knew it was you, I probably
would've sent it to voicemail
and finished my food.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.841
You can't just say you're
welcome like normal people?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.844
- You're welcome.
You're welcome.
- Thank you. Aye.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.281
Still can't believe Lisa
was gon' let you sit
in jail overnight.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.916
I never seen her that mad.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.452
Said it should've been
a learning experience.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.287
I don't know man, it seems like,

00:53.321 --> 00:55.189
it's actually been an
ongoing issue between us.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.824
Yeah, but you stood
your ground.

00:56.857 --> 01:00.361
- She can't fault you for that.
- Yeah, but it shed some light
on our differences.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.297
I never thought something
like that could happen to me.

01:03.331 --> 01:06.267
Well look man, I um...

01:06.300 --> 01:08.302
I will what? What you been
worrying 'bout?

01:08.336 --> 01:10.504
I apologize too.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.273
I do.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.276
- I didn't wanna accept the fact
that you've grown.
- Alright.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.445
- People change, and that's
okay.
- Right.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.281
It's cool if you wanna
order your eggs over easy

01:20.314 --> 01:21.649
and eat your steak
medium rare,

01:21.682 --> 01:23.717
straight from the cow.
It's okay!
- Okay, stop it Greg.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.454
- That locks in the flavor
by the way.
- I just wanna know how much
tighter your pants gon' get?

- That's my question.

I mean I would like to get
this done sometime.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.730
Today.

he's really paying us.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.233
Why would I pay you two
to help me move?

01:39.267 --> 01:41.068

as my friends.

- I got to stop
answering my phone.
- Yeah.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.077
Unless it's me, I could be
in jail.

Oh, so you not gonna even
open the door?

can't even pick up a box.
- That's what we doin' now?

- Greg, can you put that box
in the kitchen.
- Yep.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.766
Jarvis, put that one please
in that chair.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.236
- Okay, yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.
- I got you.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.771
Aye, you and Naomi
been rocking strong man.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.407
Why you didn't just move
back in with her?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.575
Well, we're starting over.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.211
- We're dating!
- Dating?

02:23.244 --> 02:25.446
Yeah, you know. Kind of
getting to know each other.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.714
Getting to know each other?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.949
Y'all have a whole ass
kid together.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.751
Well it was the therapist's
idea.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.620
And you know the problem
with most men?

02:32.653 --> 02:36.457
- Hm.
- Once we get our woman,
we don't do the work to keep
them.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.060
Let me guess. Your therapist
made you memorize that quote.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.631
[Laughing]
It's like I'm paying her
to tell me how to spend
my own money.

02:43.664 --> 02:47.735
Aye uh, don't you think it's
time for you to reach out
to Keith?

02:47.768 --> 02:50.271
It's been like over a month
since you uh,

02:50.304 --> 02:52.640
had that situation, huh?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.442
I don't know if that's
a good idea.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.576
Why not?

02:55.609 --> 02:59.480
Keith has been, taking some
rigorous boxing lessons.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.848
What's that have to do with me?

03:00.881 --> 03:03.651
He uses a picture of you
on the punching bag.
For motivation.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.654
Listen fellas, I messed up.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.590
Big time.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.860
I violated and feel horrible.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.765
But I just felt like Keith
needed his space.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.002
- I'll holler at him eventually.
- Please do.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.773
Soon? 'Cause I'm getting
tired of lying to him every time
we hanging out.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.876
Wow, he's still that mad?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.779
So where does he think
you are now?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.781
Out grocery shopping with Lisa.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.317

03:36.350 --> 03:39.320
Out grocery shopping
with Jarvis and Lisa.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.021

03:41.054 --> 03:43.991
I will fix this.
I promise.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.327
- Alright?
- Alright.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.997
Now in the mean time,
I'm going to order a pizza.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.532
As payment for you
helping me move.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.634
- Pizza?
- Pizza? Can you get
any cheaper?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.936
I mean, what? We got a two
topping limit? What's up man?

get going for my deposition

03:58.572 --> 04:01.141
for my lawsuit against
the police department so,
I got to go.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.110
Wow, it's moving along huh?

04:03.143 --> 04:04.678
Well the arrest was illegal.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.214
And we can't let 'em keep
treating us like second-class
citizens.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.217
It's been going on for centuries
I'm glad you're finally
starting to--
- Ay, aye, aye, Greg.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.353
- Don't start.
- Okay, but look, look,
Greg is right.

04:12.386 --> 04:15.356
We've actually had some
conversations, and I can admit
that uh,

04:15.389 --> 04:18.326
Maybe I've been a little naive,
out of touch.

04:18.892 --> 04:23.597
But there are kids that are
experiencing police brutality
with no access to lawyers
that I have.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.833

it go.

feeling better.
- Yeah.

few weeks. I'm glad
he's leveling up.

training?

about me?

myself.

for our Black men.

the same for us.

a jolly good time, doesn't it?

what are your rates?

in the process of raising
my rates

pay that.

being released to the public.

an active investigation.

and have the footage released.

to be filed.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.025
That, even when I was
manhandled,

10:58.058 --> 11:02.095
and roughed up by the officers,
I still maintained hope.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.465
That somewhere down the line,
they would be held accountable.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.036
By somebody.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.972
A sergeant. A chief.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.476
But it just seems like uh,
I don't know.

11:17.144 --> 11:20.113
You just, keep trying
to justify it.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.549
What else is there
to investigate?

11:22.582 --> 11:25.485
We have to do our job
Mr. Johnson.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.822
- This is not about emotions
right now?
- No?

11:28.856 --> 11:32.659
This is about an active
investigation.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.513
This is the other part
of your pay.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.483
Couldn't at least get
some aged whiskey?

11:56.516 --> 11:59.452
Well either you or Jarvis
broke my glasses,

11:59.486 --> 12:01.855
so you should be grateful
to even be getting that.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.858
At least it's cold. Cheers dog.
- Cheers.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.264
So how's the bachelor life
been treatin' you?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.366
Man, amazing.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.669
I don't have to explain to
anyone why I fell asleep early.
- Mm.

12:16.703 --> 12:19.672
- Leave my toilet seat up
all day, right? Yeah.
- Oh?

12:19.706 --> 12:21.608
Been going well man.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.010
So you been havin'
a rough time, huh?

12:23.043 --> 12:25.512
- I miss her so much Omar.
- Yeah.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.647
Greg, that's normal.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.650
So have you been going out?
I mean, have you been
meeting new people?

12:30.683 --> 12:34.021
I've come to realize, I don't
really like people like that.

12:34.054 --> 12:37.524
Haven't been working.
Uber deactivated my account.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.560
They said people were
complaining that my car was
polluting the ozone.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.695
Did you ever get your
emissions fixed?

12:42.729 --> 12:44.564
Define fixed.
[Sighs]

12:44.597 --> 12:47.500
I slid my mechanic 40 bucks
and he gave me a sticker.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.136
So what have you been
doing for money Greg?

12:49.169 --> 12:51.571
Handyman work here and there.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.108
Okay, listen, I'll uh...

12:55.742 --> 12:58.578
I'll keep my ears open,
for some job opportunities,
okay?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.413
My man.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.851
But I need you to get out there
and find somebody, man.
I'm tired of seeing you
moping around.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.285
Tired of moping.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.889
But I'm the prize Omar.
I need a woman that can
recognize that, alright.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.892
- Y'all hear me?
- Oh you're the prize?
- I'm the prize, dammit.

- Okay. I'll let you tell it.
- Damn right.
[Phone Ringing]

13:19.699 --> 13:22.903
- Hey son!
- Dad, mom took my phone.

13:22.936 --> 13:27.374
- And she won't give it back!
- Why don't you tell your dad
what you were doing
on your phone.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.377
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to like those
pictures ma.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.245
You did a double tap
on accident?

13:32.279 --> 13:33.914
She's being mad annoying.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.548
Now where's my damn phone?

13:35.582 --> 13:38.018
- Aye Caleb! Don't talk to
your mother like that!
- Boy!

13:38.051 --> 13:41.021
I brought you into this world
and I will-- you know what?
Go to your room.

13:41.054 --> 13:45.092
Right now. No phones,
no video games, I mean it!
[Caleb] I hate it here.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.726
- You're always trippin '.

13:46.759 --> 13:50.263
Your son has lost his mind Omar.
He is workin' my nerves.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.732
[Chuckles]
You really gon' take him
out, huh?

13:52.765 --> 13:55.402
Do you know he was liking
twerk videos on the 'gram?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.637
Ain't nothin' wrong with that.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.472
Maybe for him.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.308
Caleb is growing up.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.277
He's at an age now where
I need to talk to him about
what he's feeling.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.080
Okay look, I'm gonna text
you my address as soon
as we finish.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.616
I want you and Caleb
to slide through this
weekend, okay?

14:09.649 --> 14:12.619
Alright. I'll see you
later babe.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.655
- Uh-oh.
- What is it?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.290
It's Keith.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.159
He wants to grab
a drink tonight.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.928
Look, I'm all out of lies Omar.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.431
This is your chance.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.601
Okay, give him a location.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.904
But make sure, you tell him
that I'm gonna be there.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.305
I don't need any surprises.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.308
I'm just happy I got a front
row seat to the main event.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.310
David versus Goliath.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.282

- I'm gonna grab another
slice of pizza.

you broke the code.

gonna be put on trial tonight.

Oh, this is not a trial.
You already been found guilty.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.917
I blame the Casamigos.
- Oh! Okay.

15:50.950 --> 15:55.088
Don't worry Eugene, we beat him
up everyday because of it.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.091
Good. You should always have
good brothers around you

-Yeah. See that's why he got me.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.231
'Cause I'm always brutally
honest.

That's not why I keep you
around. I keep you around
'cause you ain't got no other

That should've
hurt my feelings.

relax and enjoy the night?

16:29.422 --> 16:32.359

Your wife,

17:04.624 --> 17:10.530

together is she wasn't confident
that you could take care of her

- Come on Book now,

nothing like that, man--
- Nah man I can answer Al Roker.

- Whoo.
- Yes I do.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.176
Women are attracted
to stability. Money creates
stability.

So, you know?
- You the smart one.
- I think it's common sense,
yeah?

17:26.979 --> 17:29.682
If it was common, everybody
would have it.

17:29.716 --> 17:34.687
You know a wise man once said,
that only women, babies and dogs
are loved unconditionally.

17:34.721 --> 17:38.191
A man is only loved under
the conditions that he provides
something.

- Chris Rock.

- That's how.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.387
I told these boys about
them gym muscles.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.390
- Yo, what's the difference unc?
- Well gym muscles look good,

18:10.423 --> 18:13.393

of peanut butter.

[Instrumental Hip-Hop Music]

23:09.489 --> 23:12.459
You know when I was a kid man,

23:12.492 --> 23:15.094
I used to run away from home
every other weekend.

23:15.127 --> 23:18.598
Pack all my G.I. Joe's,
a bag of skittles and...

23:18.631 --> 23:21.534
that's all I thought I needed.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.972
I'd only get about five blocks.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.809
Sit on the curb and
eat all my candy.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.346
But when I was done?
I'd just go back home.

23:34.380 --> 23:37.349
'Cause I missed my nintendo.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.923
Caleb's a good kid man.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.526
He's gon' be alright.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.395
(quietly) I hope so.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.342
Is that Caleb's bike?

24:03.375 --> 24:06.345
Where?

24:06.378 --> 24:09.281
That's Caleb's bike!

24:10.116 --> 24:13.052
Pull over!
Pull over Greg, pull over.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.362
Hey!

24:23.395 --> 24:26.365
(yelling) Where's my son?
Where's my son?

24:26.398 --> 24:29.502
- I don't know what you talking
about!
- You're lying! You lying,
where's my son?

24:29.536 --> 24:31.871
- I don't know what you
talking 'bout!
- That's his bike!

24:31.904 --> 24:34.874
- Where'd you get my son's bike?
- Walmart!

24:34.907 --> 24:38.711
- You lying to me!
- No I'm not man! It was $49.99,
they lowered the price bruh!

24:38.745 --> 24:41.648
(wheezing) What'd you do?
What'd you...

24:44.551 --> 24:47.453
Aye...

25:04.503 --> 25:06.973
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.944
Hey if you broke, just say so!

25:13.112 --> 25:16.015
(Quiet Sobbing)

25:23.923 --> 25:25.825
We'll find him.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.795
- We'll find him.
- (sobbing) Greg, we got to find
my son.
