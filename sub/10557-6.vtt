interrupt you, Detective,

01:36.730 --> 01:40.067
but I must see you immediately
on an extremely urgent matter.

01:40.067 --> 01:40.734
Yes, of course, Doctor.

01:40.734 --> 01:41.535
What is it?

01:41.535 --> 01:44.071
This.

I'm sorry, William.

I promise to exercise--
I-- I do have

01:49.676 --> 01:52.279
another reason for this visit,
a slightly more appropriate one.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.747
Well, I should hope so, Doctor.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.449
I would hate to think
you came all the way here

01:55.449 --> 01:57.618
just to have your way with me.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.685

Oh, William, let
me have my fun.

couldn't resist.

believe it was an accident.

of relieving the young woman

03:19.633 --> 03:22.269
Look for footprints, wheel
tracks, and pieces of cloth.

03:22.269 --> 03:25.305
Her body may have been wrapped
in a sheet or a blanket

03:25.305 --> 03:26.440
for transport.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.141
And begin the search for
any possible witnesses.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.077
Sir.
Anything else?

03:30.077 --> 03:33.346
See if anyone has reported
any young women missing.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.415
I suppose the only clue
we have as to her identity

03:35.415 --> 03:36.383
is the bracelet.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.185
Well, I'll try to
locate its origin.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.019
Right.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.324
Doctor?

03:44.324 --> 03:46.593
There's a significant amount
of bruising on her left

03:46.593 --> 03:48.628
arm and torso.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.297
I'd say it's at least a day old.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.700

already reversed.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.237
The muscles are flaccid.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.407
I believe she's been
dead at least 24 hours.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.541
There's something odd, however.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.442
What's that?

04:02.442 --> 04:05.245
Her body exhibits an
unusual lack of lividity.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.547
One would expect blood pooling.

04:07.547 --> 04:08.648
But there isn't any.

04:08.648 --> 04:09.483
Exactly.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.685
Her eyes are dull.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.488
There's severe inflammation
of the conjunctiva,

04:14.488 --> 04:17.624
as though she'd bled from them.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.026
I'll have to examine
her further, of course.

04:20.026 --> 04:23.597
But for now, I'd venture
to say our victim was

04:23.597 --> 04:25.499
somehow drained of her blood.

I do.

Shall I-- shall I shout it?

04:55.328 --> 04:56.196
Uh, no.

04:56.196 --> 04:59.599
That won't be necessary.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.102
There was no water
in our victim's lungs.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.970
Meaning she was dead
before her body was

05:03.970 --> 05:05.172
placed in the drainage ditch.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.574
The time of death was
approximately 36 hours ago.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.743
Were you able to ascertain
the cause of the bruising?

05:09.743 --> 05:13.046
It seems to be blunt
force trauma of some sort.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.080
And the cause of death?

05:14.080 --> 05:16.049
Well, determination
in a case such as this

05:16.049 --> 05:19.519
is extremely difficult. The
organs are extremely pale.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.121
They aorta and
the heart chambers

05:21.121 --> 05:23.123
are significantly
reduced in volume.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.025
The main pulmonary artery
and superior vena cava

05:25.025 --> 05:27.327
are collapsed.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.362
And the cause of death?

05:29.362 --> 05:30.197
Inconclusive.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.035
Could she have died of
a disease of some sort,

05:35.035 --> 05:37.103
a hemorrhagic fever, perhaps?

05:37.103 --> 05:37.737
It's unlikely.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.472
They're extremely rare.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.074
You certainly would
know about it if it

05:41.074 --> 05:44.010
had been reported in the city.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.581
Then why were her clothes
removed, but not her bracelet?

05:47.581 --> 05:50.350
Perhaps the assailant was
about to grab the bracelet

05:50.350 --> 05:51.451
before he was interrupted?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.022
And with that
amount of blood loss,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.558
her clothes would have
been heavily bloodstained,

05:58.558 --> 05:59.392
wouldn't they?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.228
Soaked through, I'd imagine.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.496
Most likely the reason
that they were missing.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.499

know that she bled to death.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.050
She put in very
long hours at work,

07:30.050 --> 07:33.386
and then she would come home and
she would help me with my work.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.022
I-- I take in ironing.

07:36.022 --> 07:39.359
And when was the last time
you saw her, Mrs. Dunn?

07:39.359 --> 07:41.328
The day before yesterday.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.630
She was leaving
for work and I was

07:43.630 --> 07:46.499
heading to the train station.

07:46.499 --> 07:50.003
I spent that night with
my cousin in Port Perry.

And when did you return?

07:51.438 --> 07:53.239
Yesterday afternoon.

07:53.239 --> 07:57.711
Um, she often worked very
late into the evening,

come home at all.

see the doctor, but she refused,

that I left, I-- I

home and rest,

nothing of it.

HENRY BIXBY: Yes, she was an
extremely conscientious girl.

out for the exacting demands

day before yesterday.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.257
How did she take the news?

She was disappointed,
of course.

But she knew that I had grounds.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.098
Do you know where she might
have gone after leaving here?

09:25.098 --> 09:27.233
She went to see her

Oh.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.170
Miss Dunn was ill?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.471
I suppose.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.573
In retrospect, that
would go some way

09:33.573 --> 09:37.010
to explaining why she was unable
to meet our standards, yes.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.645
Did she happen to
mention the doctor's name?

09:38.645 --> 09:39.479
She did.

09:39.479 --> 09:43.750
It was, um, Dr. Task.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.218
No, that's not correct.

she was feeling ill and
on her way to see you.

her in quite some time.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.465
I'm trying to understand
what you're telling me.

ill, or that she was murdered?

the postmortem?

perhaps you could help us.

It's a record of Lillie

12:22.108 --> 12:25.378
We know that she left home at
approximately 7:45 AM the day

12:25.378 --> 12:26.679

12:26.679 --> 12:30.049
She was at work until
5:15, when she was fired.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.352
Feeling ill, she decided
to visit Dr. Tash

12:32.352 --> 12:35.021

at the doctor's office.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.290

dead for 36 hours,

12:54.140 --> 12:56.075
She'd been approximately
eight weeks pregnant.

why she bled to death.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.314
Indeed, but the question
is whether the miscarriage

13:01.314 --> 13:03.149
was spontaneous or induced.

Have you ever treated a young
woman named Lillie Dunn?

21:39.665 --> 21:42.501
No, I've never met
anyone by that name.

Perhaps I can
refresh your memory.

girls for all kinds of reasons.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.077

no appointment.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.414

DR. FITCH: They're
scared, is why.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.618
So I don't make
it worse for them.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.354
I just help them when I can.

22:02.354 --> 22:06.625
And exactly what kind of
help is it you provide?

22:06.625 --> 22:09.595
I instruct them about
French letters and such,

22:09.595 --> 22:11.997

22:11.997 --> 22:14.567

a criminal act.

was a possibility.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.601
Actually, no, I don't.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.170
They throw themselves at a
man, and then they can't handle

32:52.170 --> 32:54.973
it when the inevitable happens.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.976
Don't you think you had
some obligation to Miss Dunn?

32:57.976 --> 32:59.678
I was scrupulously honest
with her from the start.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.380
I told her marriage
was out of the question

33:02.380 --> 33:05.283
and I had absolutely
no interest in a child.

33:05.283 --> 33:07.118
And did that convince
her of your resolve?

33:07.118 --> 33:08.353
Or did you need to
resort to a more

33:08.353 --> 33:10.555
physical form of persuasion?

33:10.555 --> 33:11.456
What are you implying?

33:11.456 --> 33:12.324
DET.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.625
MURDOCH: It seems
Miss Dunn was severely

33:13.625 --> 33:15.126
beaten shortly before dying.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.229
No, that is not
the way it happened.

33:17.229 --> 33:20.599
Once she knew I was serious, she
threw herself down the stairs,

33:20.599 --> 33:22.200
hoping to bring
about a miscarriage,

33:22.200 --> 33:23.301
right here in my
place of business.

33:23.301 --> 33:24.703
Can you imagine that?

33:24.703 --> 33:27.105
Actually, I can.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.740
I realized that I
had to do something

33:28.740 --> 33:31.343
to help this poor
girl, so I offered

33:31.343 --> 33:33.311
to contact a doctor for her.

33:33.311 --> 33:36.181
Do you know the punishment
for procuring an abortion?

33:36.181 --> 33:38.350
Life imprisonment is
not out of the question.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.986
You're not listening to me.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.988
I said that I offered.

33:42.988 --> 33:46.491
But she told me that she
already knew of someone.

33:46.491 --> 33:50.729
So you see, none of this has
had anything to do with me.

33:50.729 --> 33:55.267
I mean, what I mean is that
I'm not guilty of a crime.

33:55.267 --> 33:58.370
That's true, isn't it.

33:58.370 --> 34:02.307
What is true is that I find
your actions deplorable.

34:02.307 --> 34:04.409
You are on sanctimonious--

34:04.409 --> 34:06.044
Give me the name
of the abortionist

34:06.044 --> 34:07.078
Lillie Dunn went to.

34:07.078 --> 34:08.013
I don't know it.

34:08.013 --> 34:10.115
The name.

34:10.115 --> 34:10.982
It's Fitch.

34:10.982 --> 34:11.983
Ralph Fitch.

34:18.189 --> 34:19.024
DR. FITCH: Yes.

34:19.024 --> 34:21.426
Yes, I remember her now.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.395
She wanted to know why
those pills she was taking

34:23.395 --> 34:25.463
hadn't worked.

34:25.463 --> 34:26.731
I told her the sad truth.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.401
They're no better than
snake oil, pure and simple.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.235
DET.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.037
MURDOCH: Then, as per your
agreement with Countless

34:32.037 --> 34:34.739
Fausta, you counseled her on how
to abort the child-- for a fee,

34:34.739 --> 34:35.574
of course.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.742
No, no, that was it.

34:37.742 --> 34:38.577
She left.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.011
I didn't see her again.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.447
I never counseled her or
performed a procedure on her

34:42.447 --> 34:46.551
or gave her a thing, and that
is the Gods' honest truth.

34:46.551 --> 34:49.554
Perhaps you told her how
to make her own concoction.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.089
I would never
recommend that a girl

34:51.089 --> 34:53.158
try and make her own mixture.

34:53.158 --> 34:54.526
The herbs are too unpredictable.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.995
Several witnesses
saw Miss Dunn enter

34:56.995 --> 34:59.097
your building on the night
of her death, I believe.

that she appeared

35:00.265 --> 35:01.733
quite distressed and very ill.

35:01.733 --> 35:02.968
GEORGE: Yes, that's
correct, sir.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.303
They did say that.

35:05.303 --> 35:09.574
All right, um, but it--
it isn't what you think.

35:09.574 --> 35:12.010
You have to understand
my situation.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.412
No, Dr. Fitch, we
absolutely don't

35:14.412 --> 35:17.082
have to do any such thing.

35:17.082 --> 35:20.485
Now, you will tell us why
Lillie Dunn came to see you.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.587
And keep in mind
that what you say

35:22.587 --> 35:27.258
may decide whether or
not you face the noose.

35:27.258 --> 35:28.660
All right.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.296
All right.

35:43.508 --> 35:47.012
DR. FITCH: She was still
alive, but just barely.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.481
It was clear she had tried
to rid herself of the child.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.352
She was hemorrhaging.

35:54.352 --> 35:57.022
Her blood pressure was
practically nonexistent.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.758
Her heart was giving out.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.761
I knew it would be
over in moments.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.764
So I did the only
thing that I could do.

36:05.764 --> 36:10.669
I stayed with her until the end.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.736
(SHOUTING) No, this isn't right.

36:11.736 --> 36:13.171
I didn't do anything!

36:13.171 --> 36:14.506
Didn't do anything?

36:14.506 --> 36:15.707
You took off her
bloodstained clothing

36:15.707 --> 36:17.142
and threw her in
a drainage ditch.

36:17.142 --> 36:19.110
What was I supposed to
do, leave a dead body

36:19.110 --> 36:19.978
lying in the hallway?

36:19.978 --> 36:20.612
Of course not.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.180
That would have been
bad for business.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.481
Even if I had
called the police,

36:23.481 --> 36:25.116
you wouldn't have
believed me, none of you.

36:25.116 --> 36:28.219
I am paying the price for what
others get away with every day.

36:28.219 --> 36:31.222
If I had a fancy address and
catered to the upper crust,

36:31.222 --> 36:32.390
you wouldn't do this to me.

You know it!

36:42.534 --> 36:44.703
I have some additional
information for you,

36:44.703 --> 36:46.971
information that will
support my initial findings

36:46.971 --> 36:50.075
as to the cause of
Lillie Dunn's death.

36:50.075 --> 36:53.011
Further investigation indicates
that she consumed approximately

36:53.011 --> 36:55.313
one teaspoon of
pennyroyal oil, which

36:55.313 --> 36:57.115
has a component that
has an extremely

36:57.115 --> 36:59.317
toxic effect on the liver.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.685
What's that smell?
DR. OGDEN: It's used in--

37:00.685 --> 37:01.519
Insect repellent.

37:01.519 --> 37:04.189
Insect repellent.

37:04.189 --> 37:05.623
You already knew.

37:05.623 --> 37:08.493
Well, I didn't
know until just now.

there in the final report.

everything, then.

Uh, no.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.700
No, it isn't.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.137

37:19.137 --> 37:21.339
There is one more
matter to be resolved.

Tell me that your
visit to Dr. Tash

INSP.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.542
BRACKENREID: I just spoke with
the Solicitor for the Crown.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.645
He believes we have Fitch on
interference with a dead body,

38:33.645 --> 38:35.747
and perhaps we could charge him
with failure to provide aid,

38:35.747 --> 38:36.981
as well.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.449
But you know what
really upsets me

38:38.449 --> 38:39.751
is that the boyfriend's
still out there,

38:39.751 --> 38:42.187
probably buying more
bracelets as we speak.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.522
Perhaps there's something
to be done about that.

38:44.522 --> 38:47.358
It's not against the law
to be a bounder, Murdoch.

38:47.358 --> 38:48.560
Case is closed.

Sometimes that's just
the way it turns out.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.164
But sir, a girl is dead.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.432
Do you think I don't know that?

38:54.432 --> 38:56.000
If I could hold
someone responsible,

38:56.000 --> 38:56.968
I'd wipe the floor with him.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.570
Someone is responsible.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.504
For her death?

38:59.504 --> 39:01.439
She swallowed insect repellent.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.541
And from what Crabtree tells
me, she more than likely got it

39:03.541 --> 39:05.176
from her own mother's cupboard.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.377
You want to throw
Mrs. Dunn in jail?

39:06.377 --> 39:09.013
If so, I suggest you wait
until after the funeral.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.749
Sir, how did she know to
take the pennyroyal oil?

39:11.749 --> 39:13.051
I don't suppose
we'll ever know.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.686
Someone must have
counseled her.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.421
That could be anyone--
a friend, a neighbor.

39:16.421 --> 39:17.555
Maybe she read about it.

39:17.555 --> 39:19.591
The important thing is
that Fitch goes to jail

39:19.591 --> 39:21.226
and Sally Smoot is
out of business.

39:21.226 --> 39:24.229
But sir, if we accept
this, is Fitch not right?

39:24.229 --> 39:25.363
About what?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.398
That we haul his
kind off to jail

the actions of someone

Fine.

I'm now exploring
the possibility

39:55.760 --> 40:00.698
that someone advised Miss
Dunn to ingest pennyroyal oil.

Your persistence borders
on persecution, Detective.

You understand.

No responsible physician would

DET.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.507

that Dr. Ogden would leave

40:42.507 --> 40:44.309

investigation

40:44.309 --> 40:46.577
without a very good reason.

And what would that reason be?

40:48.212 --> 40:49.080
DET.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.982
MURDOCH: Perhaps she feared
that you had been negligent

40:50.982 --> 40:52.650
in your treatment of Miss Dunn.

40:52.650 --> 40:56.487
Or she suspected that you had
provided her with an abortion.

Perhaps she simply
came to visit a friend.

40:58.056 --> 40:58.690
DET.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.058
MURDOCH: And as a
friend, gave you

41:00.058 --> 41:01.759
the opportunity to
square your story

41:01.759 --> 41:03.628
with her postmortem results.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.396
And if that's the
case, then Dr. Ogden

41:05.396 --> 41:07.598
is guilty of a grave
miscarriage of justice.

41:07.598 --> 41:10.601
Julia did no such thing.

41:10.601 --> 41:12.236
Then why did she visit you?

41:15.606 --> 41:17.608
There are laws, Dr. Tash.

41:17.608 --> 41:20.611
And if Dr. Ogden broke one of
them, she will have to pay.

41:20.611 --> 41:22.113
And if she broke
one because of you,

41:22.113 --> 41:24.182
I will ensure that
you pay, as well.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.550
I don't want her involved.
DET.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.652

do is tell me whether or not

41:27.652 --> 41:28.987
you are an abortionist.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.094
Answer me now, or I will
be forced to bring Julia

41:36.094 --> 41:38.329
before the courts, where
she will have no choice

41:38.329 --> 41:39.364
but to tell me the truth.

41:39.364 --> 41:40.498
You would do that to her?

41:40.498 --> 41:41.666
If that's what it takes.

41:45.570 --> 41:48.973
You're going to wish
you had left this alone.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.308

If a woman comes to me
needing or wanting an abortion,

41:59.384 --> 42:01.252
I do not turn her away.

42:01.252 --> 42:04.989
Whatever her reasons--
poverty, abuse, ignorance,

42:04.989 --> 42:07.458
illness-- I ask no questions.

42:07.458 --> 42:08.559
I make sure the
procedure is done

42:08.559 --> 42:12.030
safely, properly, with
the least amount of trauma

42:12.030 --> 42:13.631
to the patient.

42:13.631 --> 42:16.300
You realize what you're
doing by telling me this.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.302
I do.

42:18.302 --> 42:20.638
And I may soon find myself
dragged out of here in chains

42:20.638 --> 42:22.407
for all the world to see.

42:22.407 --> 42:27.078
But the truth is, if Lillie
Dunn had come to see me,

42:27.078 --> 42:29.013
she'd be alive today.

42:29.013 --> 42:29.647
I know it.

42:29.647 --> 42:31.049
You know it.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.483
And Julia knows it.

42:40.258 --> 42:41.225
Now you have your truth.

42:43.995 --> 42:45.496
What happens next is
entirely up to you.

42:52.003 --> 42:54.372
[MUSIC PLAYING]

43:01.312 --> 43:02.313
Julia.

43:02.313 --> 43:03.247
William.

43:03.247 --> 43:04.749
It's good of you to come.

43:04.749 --> 43:08.686
I'm very happy that you called.

43:08.686 --> 43:11.055
You should know that
I've done nothing

43:11.055 --> 43:13.491
about charging Dr. Tash.

43:13.491 --> 43:16.260
It would involve
investigating his clients--

43:16.260 --> 43:18.196
And others?

43:18.196 --> 43:20.631
And others.

43:20.631 --> 43:22.233
About the past.

43:22.233 --> 43:23.568
That's why I wanted
to speak with you.

43:23.568 --> 43:24.602
It's not necessary.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.670
Oh, but it is.

43:32.710 --> 43:34.345
Isaac and I were not
lovers in university.

43:38.049 --> 43:39.717
We're just good friends.

43:39.717 --> 43:43.521
But there was someone else.

43:43.521 --> 43:47.325
And like Lillie
Dunn, I found myself

43:47.325 --> 43:50.194
in an untenable situation.

43:50.194 --> 43:52.530
I had no desire to--
to marry the man.

43:55.266 --> 43:57.168
I wanted to be a
doctor, William.

43:57.168 --> 43:59.170
It was everything to me.

43:59.170 --> 44:01.239
I had fought so
hard for so long.

44:04.008 --> 44:06.644
Wanting a medical career
was difficult enough,

44:06.644 --> 44:07.512
but with a child--

44:12.016 --> 44:14.752
It was a choice of
convenience then.

44:14.752 --> 44:17.622
It was anything but convenient.

44:17.622 --> 44:20.057
It was what I had to do.

44:20.057 --> 44:23.494
I went to Isaac and
asked for his help.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.564
He refused.

44:26.564 --> 44:28.466
He would absolutely not
consider breaking the law,

44:28.466 --> 44:31.636
despite his personal
convictions.

44:31.636 --> 44:37.708
I was desperate, so
I went elsewhere.

44:37.708 --> 44:39.544
The procedure was an
unimaginable nightmare.

44:39.544 --> 44:41.379
I almost died.

44:41.379 --> 44:44.415
And I would have died,
if it wasn't for Isaac.

44:44.415 --> 44:47.451
He saved my life.

44:47.451 --> 44:51.622
And after that, I
know that he-- he

44:51.622 --> 44:53.524
hoped never to have
to watch another woman

44:53.524 --> 44:54.725
go through what I did.

44:57.762 --> 45:00.264
He saved your life, and for
that, I'm more grateful to him

45:00.264 --> 45:03.467
than I can ever possibly say.

45:03.467 --> 45:05.369
But he's still a
criminal to you, isn't he?

45:08.272 --> 45:09.640
Of course he is.

45:13.144 --> 45:14.612
But this has nothing
to do with you

45:14.612 --> 45:17.548
and I. We can put all
of this behind us.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.984
But how do you
propose we do that?

45:19.984 --> 45:21.686
Are you willing to
forego your principles,

45:21.686 --> 45:25.456
your values, your-- your faith?

45:25.456 --> 45:27.291
I don't think that's necessary.

45:27.291 --> 45:29.660
Don't you?

45:29.660 --> 45:32.363
I thought upholding the
law was everything to you.

45:32.363 --> 45:34.398
And that will never change.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.234
What does that mean?

45:36.234 --> 45:37.568
Now that you know
the truth, that I

45:37.568 --> 45:42.640
freely procured an abortion,
will you jail me for life?

45:42.640 --> 45:44.508
Should I hang?

45:44.508 --> 45:47.111
No, of course not.

45:47.111 --> 45:52.116
So then you'll make
an exception for me.

45:52.116 --> 45:54.552
I-- I'll do what I have to do.

45:54.552 --> 45:56.020
But that's just it, William.

45:56.020 --> 45:58.456
I don't want to be an exception.

45:58.456 --> 46:01.993
I don't want your
pity, or your mercy.

46:05.229 --> 46:06.497
Do you regret it?

46:10.067 --> 46:10.735
No.

46:14.672 --> 46:17.008
Now tell me nothing
has changed between us.

46:23.748 --> 46:26.017
I-- I can't promise you that.

46:33.190 --> 46:34.125
I'm sorry, William.

46:37.361 --> 46:38.262
I truly am.
