00:03.504 --> 00:04.705
Dr. Schweiber?

00:07.307 --> 00:08.675
Sam saw your dad
hugging a lady

00:08.709 --> 00:10.110
at the mall
last night.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.345
NEAL: <i>This clicker isn't</i>
<i>for our garage door.</i>

00:12.378 --> 00:15.315
Maybe your dad has
a secret love nest.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.792
(SPACE FUNK PLAYING)

00:42.008 --> 00:44.110
Bill, that is not sexy.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.679
Yes, it is.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.681
Bill, it looks
like you're
having a seizure.

00:49.516 --> 00:50.984
Women love this.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.252
They don't care
that Rerun's fat

00:52.285 --> 00:53.787
'cause he's
got the moves.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.526
Come on.
You guys get up here.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.894
Try it.

01:00.927 --> 01:01.962
Sam, come on, shake it.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.329
You won't break it.

01:04.264 --> 01:05.165
Ok.

01:05.198 --> 01:06.567
(MUSIC STOPS)

01:07.801 --> 01:10.403
You cut me off mid‐funk.

01:10.436 --> 01:12.305
Look, Neal,
you always want
to impress the ladies.

01:12.338 --> 01:13.907
This is how you do it.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.376
That's never
impressed the ladies.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.478
It's 'cause
I haven't done it
in front of the ladies.

01:19.212 --> 01:20.581
Look, if I had,

01:20.614 --> 01:22.382
I'd be fighting 'em off
with a stick.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.585
Guys, let's get serious.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.053
That is not going
to impress the women.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.922
Trust me.

01:28.955 --> 01:32.058
Ok, and you know
what will, don't you?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.360
As a matter of fact,
I do.

01:34.394 --> 01:38.398
I've discovered something
that will change our lives.

01:38.431 --> 01:42.002
It'll bring us power,
respect, and money,

01:42.035 --> 01:43.837
and it's right here
in the suitcase.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.206
What is it?

01:52.278 --> 01:53.647
You sure
you want to know?

01:53.680 --> 01:54.881
Ha ha!

01:56.016 --> 01:57.884
Yes, so open it up.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.485
Think you can handle it?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.787
Yeah. Open it.

Yeah.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.532
DANIEL: Yeah,
didn't she drop out?

03:18.565 --> 03:19.566
NICK: Yeah.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.201
KEN: Why would
you drop out

03:21.234 --> 03:22.869
and stay
in Chippewa?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.738
That's crazy.

03:24.771 --> 03:25.972
She used
to be so hot.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.173
Yeah.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.909
She still is.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.778
Yeah, if you
like clowns.

03:31.812 --> 03:32.946
Clowns.

03:47.694 --> 03:51.364
By the way, I got a late
RSVP from Jim Narotsky.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.599
He and Liz are coming.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.067
MRS. SCHWEIBER:
Are there any more?

03:54.100 --> 03:55.335
'Cause you keep
adding on like this,

03:55.368 --> 03:56.703
I'm gonna have
to get more food.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.105
Lydia, we've
had this party

03:59.139 --> 04:00.473
every year now
for 10 years,

04:00.507 --> 04:02.008
and we've never
run out of food,

04:02.042 --> 04:03.409
not even come close.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.115
Honey, do you want
to tell your dad

04:09.149 --> 04:10.617
about your history test?

04:11.618 --> 04:13.520
Well, that doesn't
sound good.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.722
I got a "D."

04:15.756 --> 04:18.291
"D"? What, did you even
get your name right at least?

04:18.324 --> 04:19.760
What happened?

04:19.793 --> 04:22.395
I‐‐I don't know.
I guess I studied wrong.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.965
Honey, this is a few
grades like this.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.736
Do you think
that maybe...

04:29.770 --> 04:33.139
Morty is distracting
you a little bit
from your studies?

04:33.173 --> 04:34.741
It's not
the ventriloquism.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.476
Hey, we're just trying
to talk here, buddy.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.079
We just want
to make sure
you're all right.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.214
I'm sorry. I had
a couple of bad tests.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.316
I'll do better.
I promise.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.619
All we ask is that
you try your hardest.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.154
I will.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.756
May I be excused?
Willie Tyler and Lester

04:49.790 --> 04:52.425
are on the Hollywood Squares
this week. I gotta watch.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.596
Sure.

04:56.997 --> 05:01.301
Harold, we have to go
or the Schweibers
will be offended.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.303
We missed it last year.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.671
We didn't
miss anything.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.973
It's the same party
year after year.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.509
It's smarmy.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.677
What kind of doctor
invites his patients
over

05:10.711 --> 05:13.079
to listen
to his dental jokes?

05:13.113 --> 05:14.180
It's sick.

05:14.214 --> 05:17.150
Honey, we have to go.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.418
Mom, I don't
have to go, do I?

05:18.451 --> 05:20.120
I don't see
why you should
get out of it.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.454
He's your dentist, too.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.557
Fine. I'll
switch dentists.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.160
Say, that's an idea.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.830
Harold, you are
acting like a child.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.764
Now, we're going.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.933
Lindsay,
you don't have to go.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.501
Yes.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.605
Hey, Neal, can I
put my history book
in your locker

05:38.639 --> 05:40.140
until after
next period?

05:40.173 --> 05:42.008
I don't have
a lot of extra room.

05:42.709 --> 05:43.944
Aah!

05:43.977 --> 05:46.747
Ok, now you're
bringing the dummy
to school with you?

05:46.780 --> 05:49.282
Hey, it's called
a figure, not a dummy.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.284
A dummy is someone
who calls it one.

05:51.317 --> 05:52.919
Oh, is it?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.287
No, don't
take it out.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.389
Relax.
It's just Morty, Bill.

05:56.422 --> 05:58.559
Yeah, you
got a problem?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.226
Tell it
not to talk to me.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.063
Oh, bet you want
a piece of me,
huh, stretch?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.565
Shut up already.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.667
Sorry.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.434
Just need time
to rehearse.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.103
My brother's
coming home this weekend,

06:10.136 --> 06:11.738
so I won't
have much time then.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.073
What are you
rehearsing for?

06:13.106 --> 06:15.909
Is there some sort
of a talent show
or something?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.411
For life.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.947
I'm taking control.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.817
I know I can't depend
on my crazy parents anymore.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.019
Who knows? I can make
big bucks with this.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.453
I doubt it.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.489
I mean,
ventriloquism
isn't funny.

06:29.523 --> 06:32.325
Perhaps you've never
seen a little show
called <i>Soap.</i>

06:32.358 --> 06:33.827
That guy's hilarious.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.597
Now he's rich,
thanks to ventriloquism.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.434
When Barry comes home
this weekend,

06:41.467 --> 06:43.203
I think I'm gonna
tell him about our dad.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.871
What, about
that woman?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.306
Mm‐hmm.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.374
You think
that's a good idea?

06:48.408 --> 06:51.477
Well, I have to tell him.
He's my brother.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.684
MRS. DESARIO: Daniel!

06:57.718 --> 06:58.852
Daniel,
you come back here.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.253
I need you to run
to the drug store

07:00.286 --> 07:01.522
and pick up
your father's prescriptions.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.557
I can't, Ma.
I got to go to music.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.527
You know I can't
leave him alone.
He might fall.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.194
Well, why don't
you call Joey?
He's not working.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.231
Oh, yeah.
Trust your brother
with those painkillers?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.398
Never again.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.400
All right, fine.
I'll go after school,

07:14.434 --> 07:16.537
but I gotta go.
I can't get
any more tardies.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.438
It cannot wait.
Your father's in pain.

07:18.471 --> 07:19.840
I need you
to do this now.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.042
What do you
want me to do?
I'm in high school.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.144
Oh, yeah,
when it's convenient
for you, you are.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.047
You're 18.
You're going to be
the oldest junior in Michigan.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.150
What do you want me to do?
You want me to drop out?

07:30.183 --> 07:32.753
I can bring us home
a big whopping
2.50 an hour.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.955
You know I wouldn't
turn that down.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.524
Hey, come on, Daniel.
What am I supposed to do here?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.492
What do you mean,
what are you
supposed to do?

07:39.526 --> 07:41.795
You're supposed
to go inside,
take care of him.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.530
I'm supposed
to go to school.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.898
It's called Wednesday.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.833
Where you goin'?

07:50.370 --> 07:52.138
I'm gonna get
the stupid pills.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.817
Hey, Desario!

08:06.386 --> 08:08.221
What?

08:08.254 --> 08:09.455
I've been
waiting for you.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.924
Where the hell
were you this morning?

08:10.957 --> 08:12.092
You have my notes.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.961
Oh, I was held up.

08:14.995 --> 08:15.862
Well, thanks a lot.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.964
I failed a test
because of you.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.233
What are you
talking about?

08:20.266 --> 08:21.968
It was
an open‐notes test.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.237
I left my bag
in your car
last night.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.506
Oh, so it's my fault

08:25.539 --> 08:27.073
that you left
your bag in my car?

08:27.107 --> 08:30.511
No. It's your fault
that you're the most
unreliable guy

08:30.544 --> 08:32.212
on the face
of the planet.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.446
Well, you're
certainly reliable.

08:33.479 --> 08:34.815
You're always a bitch.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.818
You know what,
Daniel?

08:37.851 --> 08:40.120
Why don't you enjoy
spending the rest
of your life alone?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.534
Uh, Neal,
I don't see
your report here.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.537
I‐‐I did it.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.904
Where is it?

08:58.905 --> 09:00.040
In my mind.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.374
(STUDENTS LAUGH)

09:01.407 --> 09:02.809
(LAUGHS)

09:04.310 --> 09:05.546
I didn't want
to write it down

09:05.579 --> 09:06.980
because I didn't
want to kill a tree.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.982
Did you know
that our rainforests
are disappearing?

09:09.015 --> 09:10.016
Neal.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.618
Hector.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.055
All right, that's it.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.858
You just bought
yourself a ticket to
the principal's office.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.393
You mean to see Jerry?
I love that guy.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.128
He owes me money!

09:24.097 --> 09:26.432
GIRL: Put me down!

09:26.466 --> 09:28.268
Put me down!

09:28.301 --> 09:29.603
Come on. You know
you love me!

09:29.636 --> 09:31.672
You're crushing
my ribs!

09:32.205 --> 09:34.040
Put her down.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.441
What? We're
just having some fun.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.443
No, I'm not.
Put me down.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.613
I said put her down!
Ow!

09:39.646 --> 09:40.947
That hurt,
you burn‐out.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.583
Yeah, well,
it's supposed
to hurt, you jerk.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.984
Hey!
Miss Weir...

09:44.017 --> 09:44.951
Leave me alone.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.419
We don't hit people
here at McKinley.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.154
Yeah, what's
your problem?

09:48.188 --> 09:49.355
I think
she's high, man.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.456
She went crazy
on me.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.658
He wouldn't
put her down.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.860
We were just messing around.
Ay!

09:53.894 --> 09:55.562
All right,
that's it.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.730
The two of you
can work it out

09:56.763 --> 09:58.264
this afternoon
in detention.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.332
What?

10:01.167 --> 10:02.202
Burn‐out!

10:04.871 --> 10:07.541
Mr. Botwinick, I was
just trying to help her.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.342
She looks like
she can take care
of herself.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.118
Sorry, friend.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.386
Picked up a little bug
the other night.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.855
Long story.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.658
Look, Mr. Rosso,
I'm really sorry
I mouthed off in class.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.727
I'll apologize
to Mr. LaCovara.
I promise.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.094
It'll never
happen again.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.162
Neal, have a seat.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.165
Here's what I see‐‐

10:32.198 --> 10:37.070
A kid whose grades
have taken a sudden tumble,

10:37.103 --> 10:39.940
and for the first time,
starting to get into trouble.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.276
Now, in my business,

10:43.309 --> 10:44.911
we call those
warning signs.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.948
I'm here to help you,

10:47.981 --> 10:50.383
but I can't help you
if you won't talk to me.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.258
Really, Mr. Rosso,
everything's fine.

10:58.291 --> 11:02.563
Neal, sometimes
we like to say
that everything's fine

11:02.596 --> 11:05.098
because, really,
things aren't fine.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.436
Everything's fine.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.940
I've had kids lying to me
since before you were born.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.710
You're new to it, and
you're not that good at it.

11:18.244 --> 11:19.279
Come on.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.282
Ok.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.384
You want me to talk?
You think it'll help?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.920
Fine.
My father is a womanizer.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.455
He's cheating
on my mother,
and she has no clue,

11:29.489 --> 11:31.825
and I have to
decide whether
or not to tell her.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.898
MRS. DESARIO:
Daniel, your father's
trying to sleep.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.399
All right,
I'll be quiet.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.207
(WHISPERING)
He's always trying to sleep.

Uh, what are you doing,
Miss Weir?

12:54.140 --> 12:56.510
What? I'm doing
my homework.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.944
That's not allowed
in here.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.346
What?

13:00.380 --> 13:01.481
This is detention.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.483
The point is
to think about
what you've done.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.051
What?

13:06.319 --> 13:09.489
Why would you want
to keep these people
from studying?

13:09.523 --> 13:11.124
I mean,
isn't that the point?

13:11.157 --> 13:13.694
You can't do schoolwork
at school?

13:13.727 --> 13:15.228
It's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.097
Teachers just
quarantine bad kids

13:17.130 --> 13:18.632
and make them
sit and stare into space

13:18.665 --> 13:19.766
until their brains
get numb?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.568
You're manufacturing idiots.

13:21.602 --> 13:23.737
What kind of system
is this?

13:23.770 --> 13:24.905
I'm doing my homework.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.339
Uh, no, you're not,
Miss Weir.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.941
Put the books away,
and you know what?

13:27.974 --> 13:29.843
You're not
doing your homework
tomorrow afternoon

13:29.876 --> 13:31.177
when you
come in here, too.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.780
What? That's insane.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.616
And you're not doing
your homework Friday

13:35.649 --> 13:36.850
when you
come in here.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.351
Ha!

13:45.458 --> 13:47.928
Botwinick's an idiot.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.996
Seidleman's an idiot.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.298
This school turns
people into idiots.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.635
It's this school.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.870
I hate this school.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.438
I broke up
with Daniel.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.841
Really?

14:01.474 --> 14:02.475
Yeah.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.979
Well, that's
a good thing, right?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.381
Yeah, I guess.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.452
Ooh. Then
congratulations.

14:14.755 --> 14:15.989
Thank you.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.660
Ha. This food
is fit for a king.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.427
Here, King.
Here, King.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.363
Hey, honey.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.165
What do you say
I ditch this chump

14:25.198 --> 14:27.267
and you and me
get out of here?

14:27.300 --> 14:30.170
Sam, do you see
another table open?

14:30.203 --> 14:33.239
Neal, people
are looking at us.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.409
And not
in a good way.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.579
What are you guys
talking about?
I'm killing.

14:38.612 --> 14:41.014
Can't you just
put that thing
in your locker?

14:41.047 --> 14:43.249
Hey, who are you
calling a thing?

14:45.018 --> 14:47.721
Hey, Schweiber,
nice doll.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.189
Did it come
with a dress?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.191
Hey, Seidleman,
nice head.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.593
Did it come
with a neck?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.296
Hey, Morty.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.731
I'm really sorry.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.900
I can't control him
sometimes.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.635
Hey, Schweiber,
how about I kick your butt?

15:01.668 --> 15:04.505
It's not me,
it's him.

15:04.538 --> 15:06.973
Oh, ok, right. Gotcha.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.241
Well, how about this?

15:08.274 --> 15:10.544
How about
I kick your butt...

15:11.578 --> 15:13.046
and he can talk about it?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.280
Does that
sound good to you?

15:14.314 --> 15:17.518
Hey, Seidleman,
knock it off.

15:17.551 --> 15:20.020
Why don't you
go pick on someone
your own size?

15:20.053 --> 15:22.188
There's a bus
in the parking lot.

15:23.624 --> 15:24.958
Ha ha ha.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.396
Thanks a lot,
Mr. Kowchevski.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.133
Some people just
don't appreciate art.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.769
Yeah, you're a hero.

15:35.802 --> 15:36.903
What are you,

15:36.937 --> 15:39.506
a glutton
for punishment,
Schwibber?

15:40.941 --> 15:42.709
It's Schweiber.

15:42.743 --> 15:44.477
You tell 'em, Morty.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.081
That stupid dummy
almost got us killed.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.117
It's not a dummy,
it's a figure.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.419
He shouldn't
even be messing with
that stuff, you know?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.622
What do you mean?

15:55.656 --> 15:57.991
Have you seen
the movie <i>Magic?</i>

15:58.024 --> 16:01.962
Yeah. Remember
we saw it instead
of seeing <i>Grease?</i>

16:01.995 --> 16:04.030
Yeah. What if Neal
has the kind of dummy

16:04.064 --> 16:05.498
that's in <i>Magic?</i>

16:05.532 --> 16:08.702
One minute it's
all fun and games,
everybody's happy,

16:08.735 --> 16:11.672
and then, "Hey, schmucko,
why don't you go kill Bill?"

16:13.607 --> 16:16.743
I know he's going
through a hard time
and all, but...

16:17.678 --> 16:18.845
You get to be a jerk

16:18.879 --> 16:21.114
just because your dad's
having an affair?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.259
Hey.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.696
How's it goin'?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.431
Remember me?

16:38.464 --> 16:39.533
From McKinley?

16:40.734 --> 16:42.002
Daniel.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.305
I don't know. Maybe.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.074
So, uh, how's
the dropping out going?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.978
A lot better than
the stayin' in was.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.180
A lot fewer
idiots hassling me
all the time.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.717
Yeah. That's cool.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.454
Do you want something?

17:02.222 --> 17:03.289
Aren't you the guy

17:03.323 --> 17:05.325
that had
that psycho girlfriend?

17:07.060 --> 17:10.063
Yeah, but, uh...

17:10.096 --> 17:12.966
We don't really
share the same
interests anymore.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.568
Well, that's too bad.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.302
Yeah, you know, like...

17:16.336 --> 17:20.306
It's like, you know,
she's not into
current affairs, I am.

17:21.742 --> 17:24.144
She's not a punker,
I am.

17:25.912 --> 17:26.980
Really?

17:27.013 --> 17:28.248
Yeah, that's right.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.351
You know
what punkers don't do?

17:32.853 --> 17:34.555
Call themselves punkers.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.590
Uh‐huh.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.724
Who do you listen to?

17:39.225 --> 17:44.030
Clash, Iggy,
the Ramones,

17:44.064 --> 17:45.632
Sex Pistols...

17:45.666 --> 17:47.000
All the obvious guys.

17:47.033 --> 17:50.103
Yeah, well, you know
I listen to more
obscure stuff, too.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.942
What are you doin'?

17:55.976 --> 17:57.544
This is where
I'll be Saturday night.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.947
It's called the Armpit.

18:00.981 --> 18:02.282
It's downtown.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.086
So...

18:06.119 --> 18:07.588
Maybe I'll see you there.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.191
Yeah, definitely.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.331
Yeah, but if I did
pull the fire alarm,

18:18.364 --> 18:19.499
would all the girls
get dressed

18:19.533 --> 18:21.034
before they ran out
of the locker room?

18:21.067 --> 18:22.636
Or would they
just run out naked?

18:23.604 --> 18:24.571
I don't know.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.573
Hey, where
were you guys
during lunch?

18:26.607 --> 18:29.409
Morty and I had
the lunch ladies
cracking up.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.777
I pretended
there was some guy

18:30.811 --> 18:32.078
drowning
in the beans.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.247
Help me! (GURGLES)

18:34.280 --> 18:36.316
Oh. Sorry
I missed it.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.251
All right,
I'll see you later,
Mr. Forrester.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.020
Barry!

18:40.053 --> 18:42.889
Hey, Groucho.
What's up, buddy?

18:42.923 --> 18:43.990
How's it goin', man?

18:44.024 --> 18:45.992
Great. What
are you doin' here?

18:46.026 --> 18:47.293
I made good time
driving in.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.663
I figured
I'd stop by,
see the old prison.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.697
What is this thing?

18:50.731 --> 18:52.899
What, are you
studying CPR
or something?

18:52.933 --> 18:54.100
Hey, Barry.
Hey, Sam.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.502
You look good, man.
Really?

18:55.536 --> 18:57.037
Yeah, you look
like a stud.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.640
Bill, you're
getting huge.

18:59.673 --> 19:01.007
Thanks.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.509
Hey, Sam.
I have detention,

19:02.543 --> 19:04.811
so if Mom asks,
don't tell her
where I am.

19:04.845 --> 19:07.213
Detention? Not my Lindsay.

19:07.247 --> 19:11.151
Neal, what did I
tell you about that?

19:12.619 --> 19:13.720
Hey.

19:13.754 --> 19:16.056
Barry?
Lindsay. Damn.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.223
What?

19:17.257 --> 19:18.659
What is going on
with the Weirs
lately?

19:18.692 --> 19:20.360
You all look so hot.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.295
Neal, you gotta
spend some more
time over there.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.297
Believe me,
I've been trying.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.633
So, hey,
how's college?

19:26.667 --> 19:27.500
Oh, I can't tell you.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.969
It would make you
feel bad.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.270
Really?
It's tremendous.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.905
There's no detention,
there's no‐‐

19:31.938 --> 19:33.339
MR. KOWCHEVSKI:
Ok, stragglers.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.509
Come on, why don't you
get to class?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.443
Hey, fat ass,
why don't you
shove it?

19:37.477 --> 19:38.779
(LAUGHING)

19:39.813 --> 19:41.114
(SIGHS)

19:41.147 --> 19:42.649
All right, come on.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.150
Let's go
to the principal's office.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.819
I'm not, uh, I'm
not going anywhere.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.120
I'm not‐‐I'm‐‐I'm‐‐

19:47.153 --> 19:48.755
I graduated
2 years ago.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.124
Then get...

19:51.157 --> 19:52.526
Get the hell outta here!

19:54.227 --> 19:57.130
Ok. Calm down.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.299
Lindsay,
you're gonna come to
that party tomorrow?

19:59.332 --> 20:00.701
Yeah. Ok.
Ok.

20:00.734 --> 20:03.203
Neal, I'll see you later.
Bye, Barry.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.574
God, I hate it
when they come back!

20:07.608 --> 20:09.510
Come on, let's go.
Get to class, come on!

20:09.543 --> 20:12.378
No. Fraternities‐‐
fraternities
are lame, Dad.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.280
They are not!
Yes, they are.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.716
They‐‐you know
what they make you do

20:15.749 --> 20:17.217
to get
into a fraternity?

20:17.250 --> 20:18.952

pick up a meatball

20:18.985 --> 20:21.087

20:21.121 --> 20:23.256
and walk it to the other
side of the room.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.358
And if you drop it
on the way,

20:25.391 --> 20:26.827
they make you
pick it up and eat it.

20:26.860 --> 20:27.794

is that what you want?

take part in that
kind of activity?

Neal, showbiz
is looking better
and better.

20:35.569 --> 20:39.072
So, Barry,
are you narrowing
in on a major yet?

20:39.105 --> 20:41.608
Well, I'm leaning
towards undeclared.

20:41.642 --> 20:43.443
Right now.
Yeah, with a minor

20:43.476 --> 20:44.911

fella.

20:47.648 --> 20:50.917
No, uh...It's
either that or, uh,

20:50.951 --> 20:52.218
or‐‐or pre‐law.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.319
Yeah?
Ooh.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.888
Now we're talkin'!
Huh?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.223
Not really, but look
how excited they get
when I say it.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.693
Unbelievable.

I do all right.

the field a little
bit right now.

You don't wanna
get tied down too young.

Besides, you're
a Schweiber man!

21:11.371 --> 21:12.839
Irresistible
to the ladies.

21:12.873 --> 21:14.074
Isn't that right,
honey?

21:14.107 --> 21:16.242
Yes, that's right.
And I'm the lucky gal

It's ok. It's all right.
It's ok.

It's all right.
Kiss for you.

creeping me out.

Well, I liked when
Senor Wences did it.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.122
But I don't know
what‐‐

22:36.156 --> 22:37.658
What you're trying
to accomplish.

22:39.259 --> 22:40.493
Um...

22:41.595 --> 22:43.463
Barry, there's
something I've been, um,

22:43.496 --> 22:44.665
meaning
to talk to you about.

22:44.698 --> 22:46.967
What's that?
It's about Dad.

22:48.268 --> 22:50.336
What about him?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.638
I really don't know
how to say it.

22:51.672 --> 22:53.439
You're probably
gonna get upset.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.975
I'm not gonna get upset.
Just say it.

22:57.177 --> 22:59.513
I think
Dad is cheating on Mom.

find out?

23:06.753 --> 23:08.221
but I'm pretty sure
I'm right.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.156
You're right.
You're right.

23:10.190 --> 23:11.224
What?

23:11.257 --> 23:12.392
Dad cheats on Mom.

23:12.425 --> 23:14.294

23:14.327 --> 23:16.329
Really?
Yeah.

I‐‐I spotted them
at a‐‐at a movie once,

23:19.533 --> 23:22.035

like, a young redhead.

23:23.003 --> 23:24.505
Uh, did he see you?

23:24.538 --> 23:27.340
I don't know.
I don't know.

23:27.373 --> 23:31.044
He, uh, that year,
he bought me a‐‐a car
for my birthday.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.213
Wha...

23:33.246 --> 23:34.615
Why didn't you tell me?

Why would
I tell you?

Did you tell Mom?

23:37.383 --> 23:39.319
No! No.

23:39.352 --> 23:42.122
Why not? He's making
a fool out of her.

23:43.489 --> 23:46.593
So‐‐uh, huh.
You wanna tell her?

23:46.627 --> 23:47.894
Is that
what you wanna do?

23:47.928 --> 23:49.429
You wanna tell her
so they can
get divorced?

23:49.730 --> 23:50.597
Right?

23:50.631 --> 23:51.998
So they can
sell the house,

23:52.032 --> 23:54.034
and you
get to see...

Dad only
on the weekends...

in his‐‐in his

check this out.

30:45.712 --> 30:48.281
What? I ain't
callin' you a poser, man.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.349
Relax.

30:59.125 --> 31:00.894
I don't know,
he was really into me,

31:00.927 --> 31:02.929
but he was just stoned
all the time.

31:02.963 --> 31:05.899
Hmm.
Do you smoke?

31:05.932 --> 31:08.201
No. What,
are you crazy?
It gets me paranoid.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.202
Yeah? Me, too.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.204
Yeah, I lock myself
in my room.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.305
It's bad.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.808
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, that stuff,
it's <i>fakakte.</i>

31:14.841 --> 31:16.009
(LAUGHS)

31:16.042 --> 31:17.410
That‐‐that's it,
though,

31:17.443 --> 31:19.746
that's the perfect
use of that word.

31:19.780 --> 31:21.047
Thanks.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.685
Wait, so what
were we talking about?

31:24.718 --> 31:25.986
Your‐‐your friends.

31:26.019 --> 31:27.988
Oh, yeah.
They're really fun,

31:28.021 --> 31:29.756
and they're‐‐
they're funny.

31:29.790 --> 31:31.157
But they're just...

31:31.191 --> 31:34.294
Well, they don't
inspire me or challenge me.

31:35.696 --> 31:37.664
I don't know,
does that sound mean?

31:37.698 --> 31:39.900
Relax.
You think too much.

31:39.933 --> 31:41.902
Yeah. Tell me about it.

31:41.935 --> 31:43.369
You know...

31:43.403 --> 31:46.006
When you get
to college, it's
funny, it's, like,

31:46.039 --> 31:48.542
all that high school
stuff disappears.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.644
Really, it's like...

31:50.677 --> 31:52.045
It's a do‐over.

31:52.078 --> 31:55.181
I mean, when you
get there...

31:55.215 --> 31:57.784
it's, like, no one
knows that you
were an athlete

31:57.818 --> 31:59.586
or that you were
a burn‐out.

31:59.620 --> 32:00.787
It's like
a fresh start.

32:00.821 --> 32:02.989
You can be whoever
you wanna be.

32:03.857 --> 32:05.091
Like, take‐‐take me
for instance,

32:05.125 --> 32:06.426
when I was
in high school,

32:06.459 --> 32:10.096
I got‐‐I got beat up
more than Neal,
you know.

32:10.130 --> 32:11.665
But when I got
to college, I mean,

32:11.698 --> 32:14.267
you didn't‐‐you didn't
hear me say,
"Hey, look at me!

32:14.300 --> 32:18.572
"I'm the guy
that got beat up every day!
That was me!"

32:18.605 --> 32:20.073
No, I said,

32:20.106 --> 32:22.876
"Look at me,
I'm the‐‐the handsome,

32:22.909 --> 32:25.311
"dashing Jew."
(LAUGHING)

32:25.345 --> 32:28.014
And, huh,
people bought it!

32:28.048 --> 32:29.883
Which is‐‐
Yeah.

32:29.916 --> 32:31.552
I buy it.

32:31.585 --> 32:33.053
You see
what I'm saying?

32:37.457 --> 32:38.625
So what do I wanna be?

32:39.993 --> 32:41.862
Give me the weekend.

32:41.895 --> 32:43.496
And I'll come up
with something good.

32:43.530 --> 32:45.231
(LAUGHING)

33:00.246 --> 33:03.183
Hey, look at you.
Hey.

33:03.216 --> 33:06.119
Oh, look at me,
look at me,
I'm such a good husband.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.588
Blah, blah, blah.

33:08.955 --> 33:11.391
You know,
Fantasy Island is on.

33:12.492 --> 33:13.694
We could watch that.

33:14.561 --> 33:16.096
Hey, everybody!

33:16.129 --> 33:18.298
I'd like
to propose a toast.

33:18.331 --> 33:21.301
To the woman
without whom
we'd all be hungry

33:21.334 --> 33:24.738
and without whom
my life wouldn't
be complete.

33:24.771 --> 33:27.541
Mmm. (KISS)

33:28.775 --> 33:31.111
Cheers.
Hear, hear.

33:31.945 --> 33:33.747
This sucks.
I gotta get outta here.

33:45.959 --> 33:47.227
Oh, no.

33:50.463 --> 33:51.532
Oh.

33:52.766 --> 33:54.234
Hey, buddy.

33:55.569 --> 33:57.203
Hey, Neal.

33:57.237 --> 33:59.005
Don't‐‐don't
let me interrupt.

33:59.039 --> 34:00.541
I was
just out for...

34:09.516 --> 34:11.718
Hey! I've been
lookin' all over for you.

34:11.752 --> 34:12.753
What?

34:12.786 --> 34:14.688
Well, I want you to do
your ventriloquism act.

34:14.721 --> 34:17.023
What? N‐‐no, not now.

34:17.057 --> 34:19.392
Why? With a friendly
audience like this?

34:19.425 --> 34:22.663
Come on,
who wants to see Neal
do his ventriloquism?

34:22.696 --> 34:23.997
(LIGHT APPLAUSE)
Yeah.

34:24.030 --> 34:25.699
Ha ha ha ha!

34:25.732 --> 34:26.833
Go on!

34:26.867 --> 34:28.334
Go on,
get your dummy.

34:29.069 --> 34:30.704
It's called a figure!

34:30.737 --> 34:32.873
Oh, gosh.
These artistic types,

34:32.906 --> 34:34.675
very sensitive,
you know.

34:34.708 --> 34:37.310
(PUNK MUSIC PLAYING)

34:39.179 --> 34:41.147
How's your head?

34:41.181 --> 34:44.150
It's fine. You know,
just another
battle scar.

34:46.252 --> 34:47.521
Just hold still.

34:47.554 --> 34:48.589
All right.

34:50.090 --> 34:51.825
Just do it.
Almost done.

34:51.858 --> 34:53.126
There you go.

34:53.594 --> 34:54.494
Thank you!

34:54.528 --> 34:57.063
Thank you very much.
Who's next?

34:57.097 --> 34:58.431
I am.

35:01.301 --> 35:02.736
Just gonna ice it
for a minute.

35:02.769 --> 35:03.804
Oh, yeah.

35:05.606 --> 35:07.173
Hey, Daniel,
what are you doin', man?

35:07.207 --> 35:08.241
Never mind.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.475
Hey, uh, Daniel,
I don't think

35:09.510 --> 35:11.111
this is such
a good idea, man.

35:11.144 --> 35:12.212
Forget it.

35:12.245 --> 35:13.747
Ready?
Yeah.

35:15.148 --> 35:17.584
Ok. On 3...

35:17.618 --> 35:18.785
I'll push it through.

35:18.819 --> 35:21.187
JENNA: Billy!
One...

35:21.655 --> 35:22.756
Two...

35:24.124 --> 35:25.659
Three!
Wait! Ow!

35:26.459 --> 35:27.728
Ohh.

35:27.761 --> 35:28.962
Oh, jeez.

35:28.995 --> 35:30.363
Oh, my God.
Ow!

35:30.396 --> 35:32.232
You've ruined it,
you wimp.

35:33.033 --> 35:36.703
Oh, jeez, man.

35:36.737 --> 35:37.938
Can we get
outta here?

35:37.971 --> 35:39.239
That's makin' me
sick, man.

35:39.272 --> 35:41.241
Let's get out,
where's Ken?

35:41.274 --> 35:42.843
That's‐‐
Shut up!

35:42.876 --> 35:44.611
Terrible!
Where's Ken?

35:54.454 --> 35:56.222
Well, let's
check this out.

35:56.256 --> 35:57.658
Ladies and gentlemen!

35:57.691 --> 36:01.361
Uh, Neal and Morty!

36:01.394 --> 36:03.296
Hey!
Whoo‐hoo!

36:03.329 --> 36:04.531
Uh, hi, everybody!

36:04.565 --> 36:06.266
M‐Morty, say hello
to the nice people.

36:06.299 --> 36:07.968
Hello, nice people.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.904
ALL: Hi. Hi, Morty!

36:10.937 --> 36:14.841
Say, how come
these people are
so funny‐looking?

36:14.875 --> 36:16.009
W‐what do you mean?

36:16.042 --> 36:18.645
Their teeth!
They're terrible!

36:19.980 --> 36:21.314
Morty, I mean, come on.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.448
No, no, no, no, no.

36:22.482 --> 36:24.551
Haven't they ever heard
of a toothbrush?

36:24.585 --> 36:26.687
Morty! Wh‐what do
you mean by that?

36:26.720 --> 36:28.321
Look at them.
Look at these people.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.256
Look at that lady
over there.
Her teeth are so bad,

36:30.290 --> 36:32.192
she should be
a professional hockey player.

36:32.225 --> 36:33.860
(LAUGHTER)
Boo.

36:33.894 --> 36:36.462
All right, can we‐‐
can we just get
to the act now, please?

36:36.496 --> 36:38.832
Oh, sure thing,
sure thing. All right.

36:38.865 --> 36:40.033
What's the difference

36:40.066 --> 36:42.368
between a proctologist
and a dentist?

36:42.402 --> 36:44.104
I‐‐I don't know,
what?

36:44.137 --> 36:46.272
Ha! One's a doctor
of the ass

36:46.306 --> 36:48.041
and the other's
an ass who's a doctor.

36:48.074 --> 36:49.910
(LAUGHTER)

36:49.943 --> 36:51.277
Morty, come on,
be nice.

36:51.311 --> 36:52.913
All right,
all right, all right.

36:52.946 --> 36:55.516
Well, uh, ok,
here‐‐here's another one.
Here's another one.

36:55.549 --> 36:58.418
Ok. What's the difference
between a dentist

36:58.451 --> 37:01.287
and a brand‐new pair
of leather shoes?

37:02.122 --> 37:03.957
I‐‐I don't know,
what?

37:03.990 --> 37:05.491
A brand‐new pair
of leather shoes

37:05.526 --> 37:07.561
will never give you
an unnecessary root canal

37:07.594 --> 37:09.663
so he can build
an addition on his house.

37:09.696 --> 37:11.164
(LAUGHTER)

37:11.197 --> 37:12.966
Ok.
Hey, Morty,

37:12.999 --> 37:14.200
come on, that's
not really funny.

37:14.234 --> 37:15.268
All right, all right.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.038
Dr. Schweiber is
a wonderful dentist.

37:18.071 --> 37:20.173
I ain't
lettin' him touch me.

37:20.206 --> 37:21.675
He's not
gonna put me under.

37:21.708 --> 37:23.577
Ha, next thing I know
I'll wake up

37:23.610 --> 37:25.245
and my
wisdom teeth'll be gone

37:25.278 --> 37:26.647
along with my virginity!

37:26.680 --> 37:29.049
Ok. Ok, that's enough.
Thank you.

37:29.082 --> 37:30.216
All right,
thank you.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.385
Why is Dr. Schweiber
a dentist?

37:32.418 --> 37:34.387
I‐‐I have no idea,
why?

37:34.420 --> 37:37.323
Because he's so stupid
he flunked out
of medical school!

37:37.357 --> 37:39.726
(LAUGHS)
Ok, that's enough, Neal.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.727
Thank you.

37:40.761 --> 37:42.128
Oh, yeah,
that's enough,
thank you.

37:42.162 --> 37:43.429
Thank you!
There's more‐‐

37:43.463 --> 37:45.331
Neal and Morty's
show is over folks.

37:45.365 --> 37:47.734
Thank you very much.
Hey, hey!

37:47.768 --> 37:49.503
You're out of order!
You're out of order!

37:49.536 --> 37:51.705
This whole dental practice
is out of order!

37:51.738 --> 37:52.706
Ok, that's enough.

37:52.739 --> 37:54.140
Hey, hey,
get your hands off me.

37:54.174 --> 37:55.509
Neal, Neal!
Get your hands off me!

37:55.542 --> 37:57.978
Leave me alone!
(LAUGHING)

37:58.011 --> 37:59.680
Excuse me.

38:02.182 --> 38:03.550
See?

38:03.584 --> 38:05.652
Told you that thing
would take him over.

38:20.066 --> 38:21.301
Honey,
what's going on?

38:21.334 --> 38:23.870
I told him
I didn't wanna do it.

38:23.904 --> 38:25.071
Neal‐‐
Oh‐‐

38:25.105 --> 38:26.372
He asked
for a comedy routine,

38:26.406 --> 38:27.908
a‐and that's what he got.

38:27.941 --> 38:29.943
Neal, what's wrong?

38:30.276 --> 38:32.278
Nothing.

38:32.312 --> 38:34.314
You can tell me,
it's all right.

38:34.347 --> 38:36.482
No, I can't tell you.
Why?

38:39.185 --> 38:41.387
Because I don't
wanna ruin your life.

38:50.196 --> 38:51.998
Dad's cheating on you.

38:56.837 --> 38:58.705
It's ok.

38:58.739 --> 39:00.106
I'm sorry, Mom.

39:00.140 --> 39:01.975
Shh.

39:02.008 --> 39:03.276
Sorry.

39:03.309 --> 39:04.945
It's ok.

39:05.478 --> 39:07.681
Why is it ok?

39:12.185 --> 39:14.655
Marriage is a very
complicated thing.

39:18.258 --> 39:20.827
But there is nothing...

39:20.861 --> 39:23.930
that is more important
to me than you
and your brother.

39:25.799 --> 39:29.435
Your father and I love
you more than anything
in the world.

39:29.469 --> 39:32.338
Now, he and I have got
the rest of our lives

39:32.372 --> 39:33.540
to work out
our marriage,

39:33.574 --> 39:35.175
but we've only got
a couple more years

39:35.208 --> 39:36.342
with you here.

39:36.376 --> 39:38.679
Do you mean you know?

39:41.047 --> 39:42.949
Neal,
we're working on it.

39:43.684 --> 39:44.751
Shh.

39:45.919 --> 39:47.788
But that's between
me and your father.

39:51.357 --> 39:53.359
Nothing will ever
change the fact

39:53.393 --> 39:56.730
that we love you
very, very much.

40:06.873 --> 40:10.443
And you and Morty
are very funny.

40:11.011 --> 40:12.478
Thanks, Mom.

40:18.384 --> 40:20.854
Hey, where's that kid?
He was hilarious.

40:20.887 --> 40:22.523
Honey, come on.

40:22.556 --> 40:25.158
Lindsay, sweetie,
come on, we better go.

40:25.191 --> 40:27.694
Where are we going?
(LAUGHS)

40:27.728 --> 40:30.263
Oh, my God,
you guys are hammered.

40:30.296 --> 40:32.132
We're your parents,
we're not hammered.

40:32.165 --> 40:33.567
No, a little tipsy, maybe.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.669
Well, your father,
he's hammered.

40:35.702 --> 40:37.170
You're driving, all right?

40:37.203 --> 40:38.972
Yeah, I'll be out
in a minute, ok?

40:39.005 --> 40:40.440
Oh, ok.

40:40.473 --> 40:44.177
Mmm, shh. No,
take your time, all right?

40:48.348 --> 40:49.883
Yeah, I gotta go.

40:49.916 --> 40:51.284
Can I come, please?

40:51.317 --> 40:52.953
Oh, I know,
I can't come.

40:52.986 --> 40:55.088
I think you've got
your hands full here.

40:55.121 --> 40:56.189
Yeah.

40:56.222 --> 40:58.559
Well... It was great
seeing you.

40:58.592 --> 41:01.427
Well, this was the best
Schweiber party ever.

41:01.461 --> 41:03.196
Yeah, I'm sure.

41:05.031 --> 41:06.332
Well, uh, listen,

41:06.366 --> 41:07.568
