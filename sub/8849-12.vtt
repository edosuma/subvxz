THAT THE EVIDENCE
YOU GIVE SHALL BE THE TRUTH,

00:11.212 --> 00:12.813
THE WHOLE TRUTH,

00:12.846 --> 00:14.782
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,

00:14.815 --> 00:17.585
AS YOU SHALL ANSWER TO GOD
ON THE LAST GREAT DAY?

00:40.608 --> 00:41.842
- IN THE MATTER

00:41.875 --> 00:44.745
OF THE UNITED STATES
VERSUS RUTH COLE,

00:44.778 --> 00:48.849
THE DEFENDANT STANDS ACCUSED
OF UNLAWFULLY, FELONIOUSLY,

00:48.882 --> 00:54.122
AND OF MALICE AFORETHOUGHT
SHOOTING INTO SIDNEY SNOW

00:54.155 --> 00:57.191

CONTRARY TO THE LAW, PEACE,

00:59.327 --> 01:03.597
AND DIGNITY
OF THE WYOMING TERRITORY.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.367
HAVING HEARD THESE CHARGES,
WHAT SAY YOU?

01:16.844 --> 01:18.646
- GUILTY.

01:24.818 --> 01:29.157
- MISS COLE...

01:29.157 --> 01:31.359
IN MY HAND,

01:31.392 --> 01:34.195
A WRITTEN STATEMENT
BY HEAD OF RAILROAD POLICE,

01:34.228 --> 01:36.397
CULLEN BOHANNON.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.201
HE SAYS YOU AIDED AND PROTECTED
AN OFFICER OF THE LAW

01:40.234 --> 01:42.170
FROM AN ARMED FELON.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.872
THIS WOULD NOT ONLY PROVE YOU
INNOCENT,

01:44.905 --> 01:48.909
BUT MEAN YOU SAVED A LIFE,
IF NOT SEVERAL.

01:48.942 --> 01:53.347
NOW, THIS COURT ASKS
A SECOND TIME.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.250
WHAT SAY YOU?

01:56.284 --> 01:57.851
- I SAY I AM GUILTY.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.221
- RUTH, DON'T DO THIS.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.889
RUTH.
- ORDER, SIR.

02:04.458 --> 02:09.197
- MISS COLE, IT IS UNCLEAR TO ME
WHETHER YOU'RE OF FIT MIND

02:09.197 --> 02:11.399
TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.934
I MOVE FOR A CONTINUANCE
TO AFFORD MISS COLE TIME

02:13.967 --> 02:16.504
TO ACQUIRE PROPER COUNSEL.

02:16.537 --> 02:20.341
- I MURDERED THAT MAN,
GOVERNOR,

02:20.374 --> 02:23.944
NOT OUT OF FEAR
NOR AIDING THE LAW,

02:23.977 --> 02:26.880
BUT FOR NO PURPOSE
OTHER THAN TO END THE MAN'S LIFE

02:26.914 --> 02:29.717
WHO TOOK MY SON'S.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.286
I AM GUILTY.
I HAVE PLED SO.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.659
- MM.

02:43.731 --> 02:48.302
- YOU, RUTH ELIZABETH COLE,

02:48.336 --> 02:50.904
ARE GUILTY OF MURDER

02:50.938 --> 02:54.342

- HAVE THE GALLOWS CONSTRUCTED
IN THE TOWN SQUARE.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.890
- A PUBLIC EXECUTION?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.858
- TRANSPARENCY, JUDGE,

03:44.892 --> 03:47.628
FOLLOWED BY A STRICT ADHERENCE
TO THE LAW.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.397
- A DEATH WARRANT
SHOULD BE DRAWN UP.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.299
- DO IT.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.566
NO MISTAKES.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.034
- YOU GOT NOTHING
TO GAIN BY THIS.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.605
- I GAVE MISS COLE EVERY
OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIT HERSELF.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.508
HER REFUSAL TO DO SO MEANS
THAT JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.577
- HANGING A GRIEVING MOTHER,
THAT DON'T SERVE NOBODY.

04:03.611 --> 04:07.014
- NEITHER DOES ALLOWING A
CONFESSED MURDERER TO WALK FREE.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.851
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW,
NOT EVEN A CHURCH LADY.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.020
- THEN PARDON HER.
YOU GOT THAT POWER AS GOVERNOR.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.488
- I DO,

04:14.522 --> 04:17.024
BUT A PARDON MUST BE
AFFIRMATIVELY ACCEPTED

04:17.057 --> 04:20.861
BY THE GUILTY PARTY
TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE COURTS.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.330
THE WOMAN IN THAT COURTROOM

04:22.363 --> 04:26.334
DID NOT APPEAR INTERESTED
IN CLEMENCY.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.570
- I GET HER TO ACCEPT A PARDON,
YOU'LL SIGN IT?

04:29.603 --> 04:32.573
- WITH PLEASURE.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.775
THE LAW REQUIRES THE NOOSE
GO ON TOMORROW.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.935
- ALL RIGHT,
KEEP YOUR GUILTY PLEA.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.104
TAKE YOUR STAND.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.106
THEN YOU'LL ACCEPT A PARDON
FROM THE GOVERNOR.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.741
- THE GOVERNOR
HASN'T PARDONED ME.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.577
- HE'LL GIVE YOU ONE.
HE TOLD ME SO HISSELF.

05:09.610 --> 05:13.647
- I NEVER ASKED FOR THAT.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.882
- "HANGED BY THE NECK
UNTIL DEAD."

05:14.915 --> 05:16.417
DID YOU HEAR HIM IN THERE?

05:16.450 --> 05:20.588
- PARDONS ARE FOR COWARDS
LIKE SIDNEY SNOW.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.894
- TAKING A PARDON,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.129
THAT AIN'T A COWARD'S CHOICE.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.531
DYING IS.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.467
- EITHER WAY,
THE CHOICE IS MINE.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.403
AND MY CHOICE IS NO.

AFTER A BAD RULING,

06:17.678 --> 06:22.483
WELL, HE'D SNEAK OUT
AND TAKE MY MOTHER DANCING.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.185
DO YOU WALTZ?

06:25.218 --> 06:28.188
- I HAVEN'T COME
TO DANCE, JOHN.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.458
- COME ON.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.661
IT'S SIMPLE.

06:33.694 --> 06:38.031
A WALTZ REQUIRES A MAN TO LEAD.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.167
- I'VE NEVER EXCELLED
IN THAT ARENA.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.673
I'VE COME FOR COMMENT
ON THE KANGAROO COURT

06:45.706 --> 06:47.675
YOU AUTHORIZED ON YOUR ARRIVAL

06:47.708 --> 06:52.079
AND YOUR ACQUISITION
OF MCGINNES' CASINO THEREAFTER.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.215
- ANCIENT HISTORY,
MISS ELLISON.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.786
- I PREFER TO CALL IT CONTEXT.

06:58.819 --> 07:02.556
- THIS IS THE STORY
I WON'T LIKE?

07:02.590 --> 07:04.925
- IT STARTS AND ENDS WITH
A FEDERALLY APPROVED HANGING.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.832
- I EXTENDED MISS COLE
A PARDON.

07:11.865 --> 07:16.136
IF SHE SHOULD REFUSE,
THAT WOULD BE HER DECISION.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.038
- MR. SNOW'S APPOINTMENT
TO MARSHAL--

07:18.071 --> 07:19.973
I SUPPOSE THAT WAS HER DECISION
AS WELL

07:20.007 --> 07:23.110
AND HIS SUBSEQUENT BURNING
OF HER CHURCH.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.213
WE ARE ALL COMPLICIT, JOHN.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.115
MEN WITH POWER AND MONEY
ARE GUILTY,

07:28.148 --> 07:31.184
WHILE A WOMAN WITH NO CURRENCY
EXCEPT HER OWN CONVICTIONS

07:31.218 --> 07:32.553
IS SET TO HANG.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.689
- BURN THIS CITY DOWN,

07:35.723 --> 07:38.526
YOU'LL HAVE NO FRIENDS LEFT
BUT THE ASHES.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.829
- EXACTLY AS MUCH AS RUTH COLE.

07:41.862 --> 07:45.566
- YOU'LL CAST HER
AS SOME SAINT?

07:45.599 --> 07:47.801
- I'M STILL DECIDING
ON THE DEVIL.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.143
- COME ON,
AIN'T GOT TIME TO WASTE.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.278
TRAIN LEAVES
IN FIVE MINUTES.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.279
- TRAIN?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.114
- FOR NEW YORK.

08:01.148 --> 08:05.653
MARY, MY FIRST WIFE,
STILL GOT FOLKS IN THE CITY.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.887
I SENT THEM A TELEGRAM.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.756
THEY SAID
YOU COULD STAY WITH THEM

08:08.789 --> 08:10.223
TILL YOU GET BACK ON YOUR FEET.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.761
- I'M NOT GOING TO NEW YORK.
- YES, YOU ARE.

08:13.794 --> 08:17.264
I'M PUTTING YOU ON THAT TRAIN.
YOU'RE PUTTING THIS BEHIND YOU.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.266
- I WON'T BE A FUGITIVE
FROM THE LAW.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.301
- NO ONE WILL COME AFTER YOU.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.936
YOU'LL DISAPPEAR.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.740
THAT'LL BE THAT.
YOU CAN START FRESH.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.241
- THE ONLY LIFE I HAVE IS HERE.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.077
- YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT ONCE
IN MISSISSIPPI.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.645
TRAIN RIDE CHANGED ALL THAT.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.180
- I INTEND TO STAY

08:33.213 --> 08:34.982
AND ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES
FOR WHAT I'VE DONE.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.651
- YOU'LL STAY, AND YOU'LL DIE.
FOR WHAT--

08:37.685 --> 08:39.687
TEACH EVERYBODY SOME LESSON
ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.790
- IT'S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO SAVE ME, MR. BOHANNON.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.324
- YOU'RE GETTING ON THAT TRAIN.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.859
- I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
- YEAH?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.661
WELL, I JUST UNMADE IT.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.130
- WHAT? NO, NO.

- NO.

08:53.901 --> 08:54.802
NO!

08:54.835 --> 08:57.170
I WAS READY TO LEAVE!

08:57.204 --> 08:58.839
AFTER SEAN DIED,

08:58.872 --> 09:01.609
I WAS READY TO GO BACK TO OMAHA
WITH EZRA.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.310
YOU ASKED ME TO STAY.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.882
AND I STAYED FOR YOU.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.255
THIS TIME, I STAY FOR ME.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.702

AND WHAT I WAS DOING?

10:07.407 --> 10:10.343
- NO.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.979
- NEITHER DO I.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.419
- THERE AIN'T NOTHING
I CAN DO FOR RUTH.

IS BE WITH HER.

ME FROM ENFORCING THE LAW

HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION.

AN EARLY GRAVE,

YOU BEST BE DIGGING TOO.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.822

11:28.856 --> 11:30.824
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN DO.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.760

IF YOU COULD GO BACK?

A BETTER HUSBAND...

A BETTER FATHER.

16:00.760 --> 16:04.064
- AFTER THE WAR,

16:04.097 --> 16:08.135
I FOUND MYSELF
WALKING THE STREETS OF D.C.

16:08.168 --> 16:12.605
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN D.C.?

16:12.639 --> 16:16.776
- THERE WAS THIS CROWD
OUTSIDE A FEDERAL BUILDING...

16:16.809 --> 16:19.679
POLITICAL RALLY, I THOUGHT.

ON NATIONAL UNITY.

16:28.321 --> 16:33.060

IT WASN'T A RALLY.

16:35.095 --> 16:38.465
IT WAS A EXECUTION.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.635
THEY MARCH
THIS POOR BASTARD OUT AND...

16:42.669 --> 16:45.072
READ HIM HIS RIGHTS.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.442
I SWEAR, IT FELT
NO DIFFERENT THAN

IT WAS LIKE A FIRECRACKER
ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.

17:41.628 --> 17:45.398

18:07.187 --> 18:09.589
THERE WASN'T NO CIVILITY TO IT.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.666

OUT OF THIS.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.775
- THERE AIN'T NO WORSE WAY
TO LEAVE THIS WORLD, RUTH.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.481
- BURNING ALIVE IS WORSE.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.294
I HATED THE SIGHT OF YOU...

18:47.327 --> 18:51.198
WHEN YOU CAME BACK
TO CHEYENNE...

18:51.231 --> 18:54.534
THE THREE OF YOU.

18:54.567 --> 18:58.405
I GOT MYSELF WOUND UP
SO TIGHT THAT DAY.

18:58.438 --> 19:02.675
I STORMED OUT OF THE CHURCH

19:02.709 --> 19:05.778
AND TRUDGED THROUGH THE MUD
AND THE RAIN.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.450
AND I SAW YOUR TENT,

19:10.483 --> 19:13.353
AND I WAS READY TO SAY IT ALL.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.557
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T SEE

19:17.590 --> 19:22.395
WHEN THE ANGER GRABS HOLD
OVER YOU ARE PUDDLES--

19:22.429 --> 19:26.933
GIANT ONES IN THE STREET.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.870
ONE WRONG STEP,
MY FEET SLIPPED,

19:30.903 --> 19:34.374
AND I FELL HARD INTO THE MUD.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.944
[chuckles]

19:37.977 --> 19:40.380
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MUD,

19:40.413 --> 19:42.982
BUT THEN I SMELLED IT.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.452
IT WAS--

19:45.485 --> 19:48.421
WELL, HORSE--

19:48.455 --> 19:50.257
- SHIT?

19:50.257 --> 19:53.393
[laughing]

19:53.426 --> 19:55.795
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.833
- OH, WHAT'D YOU DO?

20:00.867 --> 20:04.437
- WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?
I WALKED BACK THROUGH TOWN.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.838
- COVERED IN...

20:05.872 --> 20:07.740
[laughter]

20:07.774 --> 20:12.345
- NO WALK HAS FELT
SO LONG IN MY LIFE.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.014
WHEN I GOT BACK,
EZRA WAS THERE.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.584
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME?

20:17.617 --> 20:20.320
[laughing]
"YOU SMELL LIKE SHIT."

20:20.353 --> 20:21.988
- [laughs]

20:22.021 --> 20:23.022
WELL...

20:23.055 --> 20:25.958
[laughter]

20:27.794 --> 20:30.497
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

20:30.530 --> 20:32.765
- I TOLD HIM,
"DON'T SAY 'SHIT,'"

20:32.799 --> 20:34.967
AND WENT AND WASHED
MYSELF OFF.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.410
THAT WAS GOD...

20:43.443 --> 20:45.745
ANSWERING MY PRAYERS.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.752
HE WAS TELLING ME I ALREADY HAD
A FAMILY OF MY OWN...

20:55.455 --> 20:57.957
EZRA AND ME.

21:02.995 --> 21:06.399
[sighs]

21:06.433 --> 21:08.935
STILL, I DON'T KNOW...

21:12.339 --> 21:15.875
WHY IT TOOK YOU
SO LONG TO COME SEE ME.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.514
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.351
I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.695
I NEVER THOUGHT

21:35.728 --> 21:39.532
YOU'D SHOW UP
AT THE CHURCH THAT NIGHT.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.834
- [sighs]

21:44.904 --> 21:47.840
I'LL ALWAYS SHOW UP, RUTH.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.395
COME ON OUT HERE...

22:12.432 --> 22:14.133
JUST TO THE WINDOW.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.902
COME ON.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.868
THIS TOWN NEEDS THEIR PREACHER.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.452
- I'M NOBODY'S PREACHER
ANYMORE.

23:22.502 --> 23:25.204
THE HAMMERING STOPPED.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.207
- MM.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.709
HMM.

23:34.481 --> 23:37.484
- THEY FINISHED.

23:39.151 --> 23:42.722
- YEAH.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.091
- IT'S ALMOST DAWN.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.003
- YEAH.

24:05.211 --> 24:08.648
- DO YOU LOVE ME?

24:08.681 --> 24:10.583
- OF COURSE I DO.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.958
- BUT DO YOU LOVE ME?

24:23.696 --> 24:26.098
- I CAN'T LOSE YOU, RUTH.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.975
- I LOVE YOU.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.151
I WAS A COWARD.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.857
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
HOW I FELT.

24:54.961 --> 24:59.566
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN YOU
AND MADE YOU MINE.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.704
THE THREE OF US
COULD'VE BEEN A FAMILY.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.684
DO YOU LOVE HER?

25:19.251 --> 25:21.588
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN SAY.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.089
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:23.122 --> 25:27.326
- YOU ALWAYS KNOW...

25:27.359 --> 25:29.896
DEEP DOWN.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.036
- I THINK I MIGHT.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.612
- GO TO HER.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.749
TELL NAOMI.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.687
- I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'D HAVE ME.

25:56.756 --> 25:59.926
- THE BRAVE CHOICE
IS ALWAYS FAMILY.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.812
- COME ON, GET UP.

PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE CELL.

27:15.467 --> 27:19.305
- JUST--JUST GIVE US A MINUTE.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.040
- THE LAW REQUIRES
THE DEATH WARRANT

27:21.073 --> 27:24.811
BE READ ALOUD THE MORNING
OF THE EXECUTION

27:24.844 --> 27:27.780
BY THE OFFICER ON DUTY.

27:27.814 --> 27:31.250
YOU ASKED FOR THIS ROLE,
MR. BOHANNON.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.919
- I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS.

27:32.952 --> 27:35.955
- BADGE ON YOUR CHEST
SAYS DIFFERENT.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.732
- MISS COLE

27:45.765 --> 27:48.735
WILL ACCEPT HER PARDON NOW.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.803
- IS THAT RIGHT, MISS COLE?

27:54.841 --> 27:57.744
- NO, MR. CAMPBELL.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.385
- I WON'T BE PARTY TO THIS.

29:38.210 --> 29:42.448

DON'T.

IT WON'T BE REMEMBERED,
AND NEITHER WILL WE.

37:02.988 --> 37:06.392

IS A POOR GIRL SWINGING
FROM A ROPE.

WON'T BRING HER BACK.
