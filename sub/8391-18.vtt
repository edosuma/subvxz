00:00.820 --> 00:02.447
- MARK CYR,
11TH-GRADE ENGLISH.

00:02.480 --> 00:04.755
- YOU KNOW, IN TWO YEARS,
AMBER'S GONNA BE GRADUATED.

00:04.790 --> 00:07.270
I THINK THAT MAYBE THAT'S THE
TIME THAT WE SHOULD GO OUT NEXT.

00:07.310 --> 00:09.244
- WHY ARE YOU
IN THE DOGHOUSE?

00:09.280 --> 00:11.316
- I SHOULDN'T BE MAKING
ANY DECISIONS.

00:11.350 --> 00:12.487
- SMART GUY.

00:12.520 --> 00:13.794
- YOU THINK SO?

00:13.840 --> 00:16.070
I MADE A MISTAKE.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.145
I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.317
- SOMETHING HAS COME UP,

00:18.360 --> 00:20.806
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO WORK WITH MAX ANYMORE.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.216
- WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

00:22.260 --> 00:24.046
WHY WOULD YOU--
- I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED

00:24.090 --> 00:25.671
ABOUT LOSING YOUR BABYSI'I'I'ER!
- SHE'S NOT A BABYSI'I'I'ER!

00:25.710 --> 00:27.393
SHE'S A BEHAVIORAL AIDE
FOR YOUR NEPHEW.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.634
HE'S GOT ASPERGER'S!

00:28.680 --> 00:30.079
- I HAVE ASPERGER'S?

00:32.820 --> 00:35.232
WELL, WHAT'S ASPERGER'S?

00:38.210 --> 00:39.711
- WELL...

00:39.760 --> 00:42.342
- [sighs]

00:42.380 --> 00:46.316
- MAX, ASPERGER'S
IS A FORM OF AUTISM.

00:46.350 --> 00:50.241
- WHAT'S AUTISM?

00:50.290 --> 00:53.498
- PEOPLE WHO HAVE AUTISM
ARE CALLED AUTISTIC AND--

00:53.530 --> 00:55.077
- YEP.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.701
BUT SOME PEOPLE
HAVE DISABILITIES, MAX, AND--

00:56.740 --> 00:58.184
- WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY
A DISABILITY.

00:58.230 --> 00:59.561
- IT'S NOT A DISABILITY.

00:59.610 --> 01:00.679
IT'S A SYNDROME.
- IT'S A SYNDROME.

01:00.710 --> 01:03.770
YOUR BRAIN--IT JUST WORKS
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY

01:03.820 --> 01:05.196
THAN OTHER PEOPLE'S.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.436
- YEAH, IT--YEAH, RIGHT.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.334
- IT JUST--
IT PROCESSES THINGS--

01:08.370 --> 01:10.850
- YOU'RE JUST WIRED
DIFFERENTLY THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

01:10.890 --> 01:12.334
- BUT I DON'T HAVE WIRES
INSIDE OF ME.

01:12.380 --> 01:13.824
- NO, YOU DON'T.
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.

01:13.860 --> 01:16.135
- I HAVE MUSCLES,
AND I HAVE CAPILLARIES,

01:16.170 --> 01:18.650
AND I HAVE NERVE ENDINGS,
AND I HAVE BLOOD,

01:18.690 --> 01:19.509
AND I HAVE BONE.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.417
- YEP, AND THEY
ALL WORK PERFECT LY.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.805
WE JUST ALL HAVE TOUGH STUFF
THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:26.840 --> 01:29.491
IN THIS WORLD,
AND FOR YOU, ASPERGER'S--

01:29.530 --> 01:30.872
IT'S JUST ONE
OF THOSE TOUGH THINGS.

01:30.910 --> 01:32.707
- MM-HMM.

01:32.740 --> 01:34.367
AND NOBODY'S SURE
WHY IT HAPPENS OR--

01:34.400 --> 01:35.799
- AND NO MATTER
HOW TOUGH IT SEEMS,

01:35.850 --> 01:37.602
YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW
THAT YOUR MOTHER AND I,

01:37.640 --> 01:39.710
WE LOVE YOU--HEY--
AND WE ARE HERE FOR YOU,

01:39.750 --> 01:41.194
AND WE ALWAYS WILL BE.

01:41.230 --> 01:43.266
- ALWAYS.

01:43.310 --> 01:45.369
DO YOU WANT--

01:45.410 --> 01:46.786
DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS, HONEY?

01:46.830 --> 01:49.583
OR--

01:49.620 --> 01:51.542
- DO YOU GUYS
HAVE ASPERGER'S?

01:56.660 --> 01:58.901
- UN-UH.

01:58.940 --> 02:01.659
DADDY AND I DON'T HAVE IT.
- DOES HADDIE?

02:01.700 --> 02:05.249
- NO, HADDIE
DOESN'T HAVE IT EITHER.

02:05.290 --> 02:08.259
- JUST ME.

02:11.780 --> 02:14.749
- MAX, WE LOVE YOU
SO MUCH, HONEY...

02:14.780 --> 02:16.224
SO MUCH.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.817

02:17.860 --> 02:20.613
- SURE, YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN GO UP TO YOUR ROOM.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.414
HONEY, IT'S OKAY.

02:24.450 --> 02:25.542
- NO, JUST STOP.
STOP.

02:25.590 --> 02:27.865
JUST--JUST PLEASE.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.460
- KRISTINA, I'M SORRY.
- I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

02:30.490 --> 02:33.482
[sobbing]

02:36.460 --> 02:38.280
- HI, MOM.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.877

ALL BRIGHT-EYED.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.461
- WELL, I WAS UP ALL NIGHT.

02:48.510 --> 02:50.569
- YOU WERE UP ALL NIGHT?

02:50.610 --> 02:52.919
WRITING, JUST LIKE
WHEN YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL--

02:52.960 --> 02:53.949
MY LITTLE POET.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.639
- OH, YEAH.
- POEMS?

02:56.690 --> 02:58.578
- OH, NO.
- SHORT STORIES?

02:58.620 --> 02:59.826
- UH...

02:59.860 --> 03:01.418
- JOURNAL?

I DON'T KNOW.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.548
IT'S, UH...

03:04.590 --> 03:05.966
- WHAT?

03:06.010 --> 03:07.147
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.308
NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER
HAPPENED BEFORE, YOU KNOW?

03:10.360 --> 03:12.351
IT JUST--

03:12.390 --> 03:15.848
I JUST STARTED, AND IT CAME OUT,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.848
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS--
I GUESS A STORY.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.745
IT'S NOT--
I MEAN, IT'S NOT MAGIC.

03:19.780 --> 03:20.849
IT'S JUST A STORY.

03:20.890 --> 03:22.221
- IT SOUNDS GREAT.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.714
- MAYBE.
WE'LL SEE.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.911
- I'D LOVE TO READ IT.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.473
- UH...

03:27.510 --> 03:28.818
- CAN I?

03:28.860 --> 03:31.545
- UM, IT'S NOT IN ORDER,
AND IT DOESN'T FEEL--

03:31.590 --> 03:34.309
I THINK MAYBE I'M NOT READY.

03:34.350 --> 03:35.829
- OH.
OH, WELL...

03:35.870 --> 03:38.725
- BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
- OKAY.

03:38.770 --> 03:39.998
- WHEN I AM,
YOU'LL BE THE--

03:40.040 --> 03:41.553
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE FIRST TO--

03:41.600 --> 03:43.386
BYE.

03:43.430 --> 03:46.661
[door closes]

03:46.700 --> 03:48.395

03:48.430 --> 03:51.945
- SEE YOU LATER.

03:51.990 --> 03:54.561
UH-UH.
GET AWAY.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.293
- SWEETIE, CAN--

03:56.330 --> 03:57.809
- NO. NO.

03:57.850 --> 03:59.715
I JUST WANT ONE MINUTE, OKAY?

03:59.750 --> 04:00.853
- GET AWAY. MOVE.
- HOLD ON.

04:00.890 --> 04:03.814
WILL YOU PLEASE JUST--
- GET OFF--GET OFF THE DOOR!

04:03.860 --> 04:06.442

04:08.520 --> 04:11.489
[A Fine Frenzy's
Electric Twist]

04:21.810 --> 04:25.086
- YOU SHOULD BE WILDER

04:25.120 --> 04:28.669
YOU'RE NO FUN AT ALL

04:28.710 --> 04:30.678
YEAH, THANKS FOR THE INPUT

04:30.710 --> 04:31.677
- OH, GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.746
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.405
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.544
- DID YOU LOSE SOMETHING?
- OH, MY GOD. HI.

04:37.580 --> 04:39.377
- HI.

04:39.410 --> 04:42.652
UH, I-IS THIS YOUR TECHNIQUE
FOR BREAKING IN?

04:42.690 --> 04:43.793
'CAUSE I'M
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.

04:43.830 --> 04:44.967
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.171
- WELL, I'M--
I'M JUST GUESSING.

04:46.210 --> 04:49.008
IT'S NOT OFTEN I FIND WOMEN
KNEELING OUTSIDE MY DOOR.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.031
THIS IS KIND OF
A "DEAR DIARY" DAY FOR ME.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.172
- LISTEN, LOOK,

04:52.220 --> 04:54.313
FOR THE RECORD, I WAS TRYING
TO GET SOMETHING BACK,

04:54.360 --> 04:56.009
OKAY, THAT I PUT UNDER THERE.

04:56.050 --> 04:58.848
SO THIS IS NOT, LIKE, STEALING
OR SNOOPING OR ANYTHING.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.678
- NO, NO.
Y-YOU'RE JUST BLUSHING.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.849
- [laughs]

05:03.880 --> 05:05.677
OH, MY GOD.

05:05.710 --> 05:06.677
HI.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.574
- HI.

05:08.610 --> 05:11.647
UM...

05:11.690 --> 05:13.021
I'M JUST GONNA GET
INTO MY APARTMENT.

05:13.070 --> 05:14.856
- OH, THIS IS YOUR APARTMENT?

05:14.900 --> 05:16.447
- OH, YEAH. YEAH.
- OH.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.686
THAT'S SO--

05:17.730 --> 05:18.822
- SUCH A COINCIDENCE.

05:18.870 --> 05:21.896
- I'LL JUST TAKE THAT,
AND I'LL, UH, SEE YOU LATER.

05:21.940 --> 05:23.896
- YOU'RE NOT--YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL ME WHAT IT IS?

05:23.940 --> 05:25.999
- OH, NO, NO.
- WAY TO AMP UP THE MYSTERY.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.837
I'LL JUST NEVER KNOW WHY I SAW

05:27.870 --> 05:29.872
SARAH BRAVERMAN
KNEELING OUTSIDE MY DOOR.

05:29.910 --> 05:31.901
- FINE.
OKAY.

05:31.950 --> 05:33.906
UM...
I JUST--

05:33.950 --> 05:36.157
I WROTE THIS THING,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

05:36.190 --> 05:38.636
IT JUST KIND OF CAME OUT OF ME,
AND I DIDN'T SLEEP,

05:38.680 --> 05:41.467
AND IT FELT REALLY GREAT,
AND THEN I WAS SEIZED

05:41.510 --> 05:44.673
WITH THIS IDEA THAT I-I-I WANTED
SOMEONE TO READ IT,

05:44.720 --> 05:47.371
AND I THOUGHT OF YOU.

05:47.410 --> 05:48.820
- OH.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.373
- AND THEN WHEN I PUT IT
UNDER YOUR DOOR,

05:50.410 --> 05:51.991
THE FEELING OF WANTING
SOMEONE TO READ IT

05:52.040 --> 05:53.860
WAS IMMEDIATELY REPLACED
BY INTENSE REGRET

05:53.900 --> 05:55.447
AND DEEP, DEEP SHAME.

05:55.490 --> 05:56.934
UM, SO THAT'S THE STORY,

05:56.970 --> 05:58.790
AND NOW I'LL JUST LET YOU GO
ABOUT YOUR DAY.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.171
- I WOULD LOVE TO READ IT.
- WHAT?

06:00.220 --> 06:01.551
- I-I-I'D LOVE TO READ IT.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.931
I'D BE HONORED.

06:02.980 --> 06:05.631
- [sighs]
ARE--REALLY?

06:05.670 --> 06:06.898
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

06:06.950 --> 06:07.803
- ARE YOU SURE?
- I'M SURE.

06:07.850 --> 06:09.568
- I MEAN--NO.
IT'S, LIKE, I WROTE IT,

06:09.610 --> 06:11.805
SO CHANCES ARE--WHOO!
SM ELLY.

06:11.850 --> 06:14.080
- YEAH, I'M SURE. I KNOW.
EVERYTHING YOU DO IS TERRIBLE.

06:14.130 --> 06:15.950
CAN I--CAN I READ IT?

06:15.990 --> 06:17.878
- UM, YES.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.956
YES, YOU CAN.
- THANK YOU.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.822
- I, UH--I THINK--
YEAH, I THINK THIS IS GOOD.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.657
THIS IS REALLY WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.

06:25.690 --> 06:27.419
FANTASTIC.
- ANYTIME.

06:27.450 --> 06:28.758
IT IS FANTASTIC.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.449
AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.618
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:33.660 --> 06:38.040
- ALL RIGHT...
I'LL GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.799
ALL RIGHT, BYE.
- BYE.

06:43.230 --> 06:46.017
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

06:46.060 --> 06:48.676
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

06:48.710 --> 06:51.019
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

06:51.060 --> 06:53.233
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:53.270 --> 06:56.023
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:56.070 --> 06:58.061
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:58.100 --> 07:00.614
AND MAY YOU STAY

07:00.660 --> 07:02.924
FOREVER YOUNG

07:02.970 --> 07:05.791
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

07:05.830 --> 07:08.037
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

07:08.080 --> 07:10.548
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

07:10.600 --> 07:12.761
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

07:12.810 --> 07:15.563
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

07:15.600 --> 07:17.739
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

07:17.780 --> 07:19.668
AND MAY YOU STAY

07:19.710 --> 07:22.190
FOREVER YOUNG

07:22.230 --> 07:24.642
MAY YOU STAY

07:24.680 --> 07:28.025
FOREVER YOUNG

07:31.000 --> 07:32.137
- SO...

07:32.170 --> 07:36.482
YOU CALLED IT
A "DISABILITY"?

07:36.520 --> 07:37.726
- YEAH.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.240
LOOK, I'M SURE THAT THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO,

07:40.280 --> 07:41.963
BUT I WAS CAUGHT
COMPLETELY OFF GUARD.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.626
MAX JUST OVERHEARD MY BROTHER
AND I SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER.

07:44.670 --> 07:46.524
HE'S STANDING THERE
IN THE STAIRCASE.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.629
YOU KNOW, THE RIGHT WORDS

07:47.670 --> 07:49.012
WEREN'T EXACTLY
ROLLING OFF MY TONGUE.

07:49.050 --> 07:50.870
- I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND
JUDGMENTAL.

07:50.910 --> 07:52.707
I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT MAX HEARD.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.776
- WHO KNOWS WHAT HE HEARS?

07:54.810 --> 07:58.769
- WHAT ELSE
DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

07:58.820 --> 08:01.948
- I SAID THAT HE
WAS WIRED DIFFERENTLY.

08:01.990 --> 08:03.127
YOU KNOW?

08:03.170 --> 08:05.024
I TOLD HIM WE LOVED HIM,
AND I KNEW

08:05.070 --> 08:06.298
THAT IT WAS A TOUGH SITUATION.

08:06.340 --> 08:07.967
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO SAY TO HIM?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.106
- WELL, YOU WANT
TO BE SIMPLE,

08:11.140 --> 08:13.893
DESCRIPTIVE, UPBEAT.

08:13.940 --> 08:17.216
EMPHASIZE SOME POSITIVE ASPECTS
OF HAVING ASPERGER'S.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.593
- OH, YEAH, THE POSITIVE ASPECTS
OF ASPERGER'S.

08:19.630 --> 08:21.143
I'M SORRY THOSE WEREN'T
OCCURRING TO ME IN THE MOMENT.

08:21.190 --> 08:23.943
I MEAN, IS THIS SERIOUSLY
YOUR ADVICE--TO BE UPBEAT?

08:23.980 --> 08:25.732
- IT'S A SUGGESTION
THAT I BELIEVE HELPS, YES.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.873
- WELL, I'M SORRY.
IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL SITUATION.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.296
I WAS DOING THE BEST I COULD.
- I UNDERSTAND.

08:29.330 --> 08:30.604
- I MEAN, KRISTINA WAS CRYING.
IT WAS LATE.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.436
I'D JUST FINISHED...
- WAIT A MINUTE.

08:31.470 --> 08:32.812
- SHOUTING
THAT HE HAD ASPERGER'S.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.124
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS THERE.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.219
- KRISTINA, YOU CRIED?

08:36.270 --> 08:38.613
- YEAH.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.062
I CRIED.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.783
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- I CRIED.

08:42.830 --> 08:44.138
- ARE YOU REALLY GETTING
JUDGMENTAL

08:44.170 --> 08:45.649
BECAUSE SHE WAS FEELING
EMOTIONAL?

08:45.690 --> 08:47.100
- IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.653
IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.144
I PROMISE YOU
I'M NOT BEING JUDGMENTAL.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.978
I-I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
THAT I THINK WILL HELP.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.114
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE CRIED?

08:55.150 --> 08:57.186
I MEAN,
I DIDN'T REALLY PLAN ON IT.

08:57.220 --> 08:58.664
- CRYING IMPLIES
THAT HAVING ASPERGER'S

08:58.710 --> 09:00.803
IS SOMETHING TO MOURN, RIGHT?

09:00.850 --> 09:03.739
WE WANT TO BE SENDING A MESSAGE
THAT MAX IS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.749
HE HAS HIS STRENGTHS.
HE HAS HIS CHALLENGES.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.122
ASPERGER'S
IS A PART OF THAT.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.912
- OKAY, GREAT.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, SHE CRIED.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.746
I CALLED IT A "DISABILITY."
WE BLEW IT.

09:11.790 --> 09:13.951
I THINK THAT'S CLEAR.
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.163
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

09:17.210 --> 09:19.849
- [sighs]

09:19.900 --> 09:21.686
I MEAN,
YOU GOT TO BE JOKING!

09:21.730 --> 09:23.618
I MEAN, ARE YOU--SERIOUSLY,
THIS IS YOUR ADVICE?

09:23.660 --> 09:25.002
I MEAN,
ARE WE THE ONLY PARENTS

09:25.040 --> 09:26.655
TO HAVE EVER SCREWED UP
THIS BADLY?

09:26.700 --> 09:29.931
- I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY
FOR A REDO WITH MAX.

09:29.980 --> 09:32.323
- WHAT IS THIS?

09:32.360 --> 09:34.089
- THAT IS A SCRIPT.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.259
IT'S A BLUEPRINT FOR YOU
TO TALK TO YOUR CHILD

09:36.290 --> 09:38.702
ABOUT THIS DIAGNOSIS.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.911
SO YOU SHOULD READ
IT TOGETHER,

09:40.950 --> 09:43.646
MAINLY BECAUSE I THINK YOU BOTH
NEED TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE

09:43.680 --> 09:47.684
BEFORE YOU TALK TO MAX
ABOUT HIS AUTISM AGAIN.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.609
SO TAKE SOME TIME.
TAKE A FEW DAYS.

09:50.650 --> 09:51.719
REALLY STUDY IT.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.684
PRACTICE.

09:54.730 --> 09:56.686
- PRACTICE.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.142
- I KNOW YOU BOTH WANT
THE BEST FOR MAX. I DO TOO.

09:59.180 --> 10:03.048
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
TRANSITION FOR HIM.

10:03.080 --> 10:07.699
HE'S GOING TO NEED YOU.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.220
- I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT
ON BOARD WITH THIS AT ALL.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.875
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I'M NOT
ON BOARD, HONEY.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.182
I MEAN, WE GO TO HIM FOR HELP,

10:13.230 --> 10:16.017
AND HIS ADVICE IS TO FEED OUR
SON A BUNCH OF POSITIVE SPIN.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.641
- MM-HMM. THAT'S NOT
WHAT HE MEANT AT ALL.

10:17.680 --> 10:18.817
- THAT IS WHAT HE MEANT.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.294
LET'S LOOK
AT THE SCRIPT TOGETHER.

10:20.340 --> 10:22.058
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.
GO AHEAD.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.749
- "QUALITIES AND DIFFICULTIES
OF THOSE WITH ASPERGER'S.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.200
QUALITY--DETERMINED."

10:25.240 --> 10:27.060
THAT'S A POSITIVE THING.
- ALL RIGHT.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.137
- "DIFFICULTY--MAKING FRIENDS."
- MM-HMM.

10:30.180 --> 10:32.694
- "QUALITY--
HUMOROUS IN A UNIQUE WAY."

10:32.730 --> 10:34.209
- MEANING NO ONE GETS
HIS JOKES.

10:34.250 --> 10:37.731
- "QUALITY--EXCEPTIONAL
AT REMEMBERING THINGS

10:37.770 --> 10:39.180
THAT OTHERS CAN'T."

10:39.220 --> 10:41.666
- THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE
DON'T CARE ABOUT--BUGS.

10:41.710 --> 10:43.189
THE LIFE SPAN
OF A PARTICULAR INSECT

10:43.220 --> 10:45.188
OR THE WINGSPAN
OF A FLYING COCKROACH.

10:45.230 --> 10:46.356
WHO CARES?

10:46.400 --> 10:47.913
- THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS.
- I CA--I CARE.

10:47.950 --> 10:51.738
"DIFFICU LTY--READING
OTHER PEOPLE'S CUES."

10:51.780 --> 10:53.259
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD START.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.439
THIS IS HELPFUL.
- WELL, I DON'T.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.687
I THINK IT'S A BUNCH
OF POSITIVE LANGUAGE.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.028
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

10:59.070 --> 11:01.686
IT'S A LIE.

11:01.730 --> 11:03.686
- [sighs]

11:03.730 --> 11:06.346
- CAN I BRING
MY DRESS-UP CLOTHES

11:06.380 --> 11:08.689
TO THE SLEEPOVER
WITH JABBAR?

11:08.730 --> 11:10.482
- UM...

11:10.530 --> 11:13.499
GOSH, SWEETIE, I DON'T KNOW
IF WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE

11:13.530 --> 11:15.384
TO HAVE THAT SLEEPOVER
WITH JABBAR.

11:15.430 --> 11:17.489
- NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU GUYS SAID
THAT YOU WERE HAVING

11:17.530 --> 11:20.704
AN ANNIVERSARY FOR LOVE,
AND THAT MEANT

11:20.740 --> 11:22.367
THAT I GOT TO HAVE
A SLEEPOVER.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.981
- I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT I SAID, SWEETIE, AND...

11:24.020 --> 11:25.328
- SYD, HEAD UPSTAIRS.
- I MEANT IT.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.361
- GET YOUR SHOES ON.
FIND YOUR BACKPACK.

11:27.410 --> 11:29.196
WE'LL FIGURE OUT ALL
THE SLEEPOVER DETAILS LATER.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.468
OKAY?
- OKAY.

11:30.510 --> 11:32.922
BUT I REALLY, REALLY WANT
TO HAVE A SLEEPOVER.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.757
- OKAY, SO DO WE.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.724
- WE REALLY DO.
WE DO, SWEETIE.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.239
I PROMISE.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.339
- THE ONE TIME
WE'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE

11:40.380 --> 11:43.315
AN ANNIVERSARY DATE,
JUST US, THE ONE TIME--

11:43.350 --> 11:45.079
- I KNOW, BABE.
I KNOW.

11:45.110 --> 11:47.169
- BUT IF WE CANCEL WITH HER,
WON'T IT LOOK

11:47.220 --> 11:49.074
LIKE WE'RE TAKING CROSBY'S SIDE
IN THE WHOLE THING?

11:49.120 --> 11:50.382
- WILL IT?
- IT MIGHT.

11:50.430 --> 11:52.011
- I DON'T WANT TO TAKE SIDES.

11:52.050 --> 11:53.847
HE'S MY BROTHER,
BUT HE'S SCREWED UP.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.292
- IS THAT AN UNDERSTATEMENT,
OR ARE YOU JUST BEING LITERAL?

11:56.330 --> 11:57.877
HMM.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.808
- OKAY,
WE SHOULD CANCEL, RIGHT?

11:59.850 --> 12:02.023
- YEP.
- YES.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.436
OKAY.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.471
HERE WE GO.
- [sighs]

12:05.510 --> 12:08.445
[phone beeps, dial tone]

12:08.480 --> 12:10.960
- I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU
EVEN SAY?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.513
- "SORRY ABOUT YOUR BETRAYAL."

12:12.550 --> 12:14.347
[both chuckle]

12:14.380 --> 12:16.792
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.
- SORRY. I'M JUST--

12:16.830 --> 12:18.764
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO TAKING YOU OUT

12:18.800 --> 12:20.279
ON AN ANNIVERSARY DATE, HONEY.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.423
EIGHT YEARS.

12:21.460 --> 12:23.519
- I KNOW.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.185
I KNOW.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.009
- MAX?

12:33.060 --> 12:35.460
- MM-HMM?

12:35.510 --> 12:37.853
- BUDDY?
- WHAT?

12:37.890 --> 12:41.303
- IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

12:41.340 --> 12:42.853
- NOPE.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.300
- ARE YOU SURE?

12:45.350 --> 12:47.136
- YEP.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.511
- HEY.
- OKAY.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.414
- MORNING, EVERYBODY.

12:50.450 --> 12:53.556
- HEY.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.489
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:56.530 --> 12:59.567
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.012
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, HEY, MAX,
I GOT TO TAKE OFF TO WORK.

13:02.050 --> 13:03.460
YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY,
OKAY, BUDDY?

13:03.500 --> 13:04.842
- OKAY.
- HONEY, COME ON.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.053
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, BUDDY.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.846
- LOOK, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
HE LOOKS FINE.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.539
- HE LOOKS
HOW HE ALWAYS LOOKS.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.855
I JUST THINK THAT MAYBE
WE SHOULD BRING THIS UP AGAIN

13:14.890 --> 13:16.198
AND GIVE HIM THE CHANCE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.377
- I DON'T WANT TO UPSET HIM.

13:17.410 --> 13:18.479
HE'S PROCESSING IT
IN HIS OWN WAY.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.545
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN MEMORIZING A BUNCH OF FACTS

13:20.590 --> 13:22.171
THAT HAVE BEEN POLISHED UP
TO MAKE IT SOUND

13:22.210 --> 13:23.063
LIKE HE'S WON SOMETHING.

13:23.110 --> 13:24.554
- I'M NOT SAYING
THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT.

13:24.590 --> 13:26.205
I'M SAYING THAT
WE SHOULD JUST TALK TO HIM.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.558
- LOOK, I GOT TO GO
TO WORK, OKAY?

13:27.590 --> 13:29.558
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER, PLEASE?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.044
- YEAH.
- I LOVE YOU.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.071
- [scoffs]

13:39.470 --> 13:42.018
[sighs]

13:42.060 --> 13:43.436
BUDDY?

13:43.470 --> 13:46.849
- I FEEL LIKE
IF I COULD, YOU KNOW,

13:46.890 --> 13:49.859
GET HER TO TALK TO ME...

13:49.890 --> 13:53.018
OR GET HER TO LOOK AT ME
AND THEN TALK TO ME...

13:53.070 --> 13:55.300
- THIS IS THE PLAN?
- I COULD MAYBE MAKE IT RIGHT.

13:55.350 --> 13:57.136
W-WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:57.180 --> 13:59.967
- I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

14:00.010 --> 14:02.035
- NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO SAY.
YOU'RE AN ASS.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.048
THAT'S THE FACT.
- I HAVE GOT TO FIX THIS.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.559
- IT'S THE WORST THING.
- IT'S NOT--

14:05.600 --> 14:06.874
- I MEAN,
IT'S THE WORST THING.

14:06.910 --> 14:08.252
IT'S THE HARDEST THING
TO RECOVER FROM.

14:08.290 --> 14:09.518
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST TRUE.

14:09.570 --> 14:11.424
- I THINK YOU CAN FIX IT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

14:11.470 --> 14:13.426
- WELL, I HAVE TO FIX IT,
BECAUSE I LOVE JABBAR,

14:13.470 --> 14:15.358
AND I LOVE JASMINE,
SO WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?

14:15.400 --> 14:16.560
- I THINK YOU CAN.

14:16.610 --> 14:18.498
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE,
BUT I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.531
- HEY.

14:23.030 --> 14:26.136
- YOU DIDN'T SAY
HE WAS GONNA BE HERE.

14:26.170 --> 14:28.547
- HEY, ADAM!
ADAM!

14:28.590 --> 14:29.375
WILL YOU--HEY!

14:29.420 --> 14:32.207
WILL YOU PLEASE
LET ME APOLOGIZE?

14:32.250 --> 14:34.935
I WAS AN IDIOT, OKAY?
I WAS SELFISH.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.551
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA ACT

14:36.590 --> 14:38.034
LIKE YOU CAN'T HEAR ME
SAYING "SORRY"?

14:38.080 --> 14:40.287
- CROSBY, I DON'T CARE
THAT YOU'RE SORRY.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.117
I JUST DON'T CARE,
ALL RIGHT?

14:42.150 --> 14:44.186
I'M BUSY TRYING TO LOOK
AFTER MY SON,

14:44.220 --> 14:46.188
TRYING TO LOOK
AFTER MY FAMILY.

14:46.230 --> 14:48.562
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
ON MY RADAR.

14:50.060 --> 14:53.678
[car door closes,
engine turning]

15:01.310 --> 15:03.039
- THERE YOU GO.
THIRD ROUND.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.446
TELL 'EM TO ENJOY LUNCH.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.482
- YOU KNOW MY MOTTO--
SHOTS PAY THE RENT, BABY.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.999
- HEY, LOU,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.314
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO SLEEP
ALL DAY LIKE A BAT.

15:09.350 --> 15:10.658
- UH, DANNY QUIT.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.349
- OH, I WORKED
WITH HIM SATURDAY NIGHT.

15:12.390 --> 15:14.381
- QUIT ON SUNDAY.
- WHY?

15:14.430 --> 15:16.079
- ON TO NEW YORK.
HE'S GOT A DREAM.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.974
I DON'T KNOW.
- WELL, SO NOW WHAT HAPPENS?

15:18.020 --> 15:19.499
YOU JUST TAKE ALL THE SHIFTS?

15:19.530 --> 15:21.282
- WELL, UNTIL SHANAHAN FINDS
ANOTHER MANAGER.

15:21.330 --> 15:22.467
AND HE BETTER DO IT SOON,

15:22.500 --> 15:25.196
BECAUSE THESE DOUBLES
ARE KILLING ME.

15:25.230 --> 15:26.982
- HEY.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.227
WHAT ABOUT ME?

15:29.270 --> 15:30.544
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:30.580 --> 15:33.196
- YOU KNOW,
TO BE THE NEW MANAGER.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.958
- YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
THAT LONG.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.651
- I'VE BEEN HERE OVER A YEAR,
YOU KNOW, OFF AND ON.

15:37.690 --> 15:39.999
- I NEED SOME CONSISTENCY.
- NO, I COULD BE CONSISTENT.

15:40.040 --> 15:44.204
- WHAT, ARE YOU JONESING
TO MANAGE A BAR?

15:44.250 --> 15:46.764
- I'M, YOU KNOW, THINKING
ABOUT MY FUTURE.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.721
- HERE?

15:47.770 --> 15:49.658
- I DON'T KNOW, LOU.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.385
I MEAN, I DREAMED OF BEING
AN ARTIST OR A WRITER

15:52.430 --> 15:54.352
OR SOMETHING,
BUT I MEAN, COME ON.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.288
I GOT TO PAY THE RENT,
YOU KNOW?

15:56.330 --> 15:58.059
WHAT DO YOU GOT,
A LINE OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE?

15:58.090 --> 15:59.500
JUST PUT IN A GO|\OOD WORD FOR ME.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.121
OKAY, I'LL TELL HIM
YOU'RE INTERESTED, ALL RIGHT?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.388
- THANK YOU.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.782
- HIT ME.
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.230
LOVE YOU.

16:05.270 --> 16:09.024
I'LL BE IN THE OFFICE.
SELL SOME MORE SHOTS.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.759
[telephone rings]

16:12.790 --> 16:13.859
- YEAH?

16:13.900 --> 16:16.721
- I HAVE A JASMINE TRUSSELL
ON THE LINE FOR YOU.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.204
SHOULD I TAKE A MESSAGE?

16:18.250 --> 16:21.549
- NO, UH, PUT HER THROUGH.
THANKS.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.318
- HEY, JULIA.
IT'S JASMINE.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.804
- HI, JASMINE.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.660
- I...

16:26.700 --> 16:29.806
I JUST WANTED TO CALL
AND FIND OUT IF WE'RE STILL ON

16:29.850 --> 16:31.226
FOR THE SLEEPOVER TOMORROW.

16:31.260 --> 16:33.706
- YEAH, I-I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA
CALL YOU TOO.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.320
SO...

16:35.370 --> 16:36.462
ARE WE STILL ON?

16:36.510 --> 16:39.479
- YEAH.
I-I HOPE SO.

16:39.510 --> 16:43.025
JABBAR IS PRETTY AMPED UP
ABOUT IT.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.162
- YEAH, SO IS SYDNEY.

16:44.210 --> 16:47.065
I JUST--YOU KNOW?

16:47.100 --> 16:48.749
AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY
WITH IT.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.792
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

16:51.830 --> 16:54.242
AND--AND I'M OKAY.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.145
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.319
AND, UM...

16:58.360 --> 17:01.352
WE'D REALLY LOVE
FOR SYDNEY TO COME, SO...

17:01.390 --> 17:03.426
- WELL, WE WOULD LOVE
THAT TOO.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.732
- GOOD.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.771
- IS 4:00 TOO EARLY?

17:06.810 --> 17:08.607
- 4:00 IS GREAT.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.392
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU THEN.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.328
- OKAY, BYE.

17:12.370 --> 17:17.194
- WHILE THE OTHERS
START TO DISAGREE

17:20.100 --> 17:22.136
GONNA TURN IT AROUND

17:22.170 --> 17:26.823
FOR MOVING GROUNDS

17:26.870 --> 17:32.558
AND IF I SHOULD COME
TO BE RELIEVED

17:33.910 --> 17:38.779
WOULD IT BE WITHOUT YOU?

17:41.400 --> 17:45.507
WOULD IT BE WITHOUT YOU?

17:45.540 --> 17:47.644
- HI.
- MOM, DAD, HI.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.671
COME ON IN.
- HOW ARE YOU?

17:49.720 --> 17:50.744
- GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

17:50.790 --> 17:51.882
- I'M GOOD.
- HEY.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.136
- HEY.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

17:53.170 --> 17:54.273
- YEAH.

17:54.310 --> 17:57.165
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOUR SISTER
TOLD US WHAT HAPPENED.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.861
- WHAT EXACTLY
DID SHE TELL YOU?

17:59.900 --> 18:02.141
- WITH CROSBY AND THE STUFF,
YOU KNOW?

18:02.180 --> 18:03.340
- YEAH,
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.

18:03.390 --> 18:04.618
- OKAY.

18:04.660 --> 18:05.831
- WHY DON'T YOU GUYS COME ON IN
AND SIT DOWN?

18:05.870 --> 18:08.737
- UM, HOW--HOW ARE YOU DOING?

18:08.770 --> 18:12.399
- WE'RE, UH, YOU KNOW--
WE'RE ALL DOING OKAY.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.534
- WE'RE GOOD.
- YEAH.

18:14.570 --> 18:17.391
- SO HOW'S--
HOW'S MY GRANDSON DOING?

18:17.440 --> 18:19.704
- TOUGH TO SAY.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.809
HE'S WORKING THROUGH THINGS
IN HIS OWN WAY,

18:21.850 --> 18:23.238
AT HIS OWN PACE.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.545
- SO MAYBE IT WAS
FOR THE BEST, THEN.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.161
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW

18:27.200 --> 18:28.758
THAT I'D EXACTLY PUT IT
THAT WAY, BUT--

18:28.790 --> 18:29.859
- HE WAS GONNA FIND OUT
ABOUT IT,

18:29.900 --> 18:31.686
SO SOONER'S
BETTER THAN LATER.

18:31.730 --> 18:33.869
- YOU KNOW, DAD,
I GOT TO SAY,

18:33.900 --> 18:35.413
I'M HAVING A TOUGH TIME
SITTING HERE LISTENING TO YOU

18:35.450 --> 18:36.769
TRY TO PUT A POSITIVE SPIN
ON THIS.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.904
YOU KNOW, GABY
HAS BEEN WORKING FOR US

18:38.940 --> 18:40.828
FOR OVER A YEAR TRYING
TO GAIN MAX'S TRUST,

18:40.870 --> 18:42.758
AND SHE QUIT
BECAUSE OF CROSBY.

18:42.810 --> 18:43.663
SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING
AT THIS

18:43.700 --> 18:45.588
LIKE SOME SORT
OF AWESOME DEVELOPMENT.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.801
- DO YOU GUYS WANT
ANY COFFEE OR ANYTHING?

18:47.850 --> 18:49.806
- NO, THANK YOU.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO YOUR BROTHER?

18:49.850 --> 18:50.919
- NO.

18:50.950 --> 18:52.838
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

18:52.890 --> 18:55.290
- YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM,
DON'T YOU THINK?

18:55.340 --> 18:57.296
BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER.
COME ON.

18:57.340 --> 18:59.808
- I MEAN,
HE--HE MADE A MISTAKE.

18:59.860 --> 19:02.203
IT WAS A REALLY BAD THING
HE DID,

19:02.240 --> 19:04.652
BUT HE NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.373
YOU'RE HIS BROTHER.

19:06.420 --> 19:09.480
- IS THIS WHY
YOU CAME OVER HERE?

19:09.520 --> 19:11.408
YOU CAME OVER HERE TO GET ME
TO--TO TALK TO CROSBY?

19:11.460 --> 19:12.484
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

19:12.530 --> 19:13.792
DO YOU KNOW
WHY HE'S IRRESPONSIBLE?

19:13.840 --> 19:15.284
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.
BOTH OF YOU ARE TO BLAME

19:15.320 --> 19:16.696
FOR LETTING HIM
GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING,

19:16.740 --> 19:18.310
FOR LETTING HIM
OFF THE HOOK FOR EVERYTHING.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.759
YEAR AFTER YEAR,
YOU MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIM.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.459
YOU DO HIS LAUNDRY.
YOU LEND HIM MONEY.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.639
YOU--YOU BAIL HIM OUT.
HE'S A GROWN MAN!

19:23.670 --> 19:25.183
IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO MAKE HIM

19:25.230 --> 19:26.538
FEEL BETTER ABOUT THIS!

19:26.570 --> 19:27.810
YOU KNOW, I'M SPENDING
ALL MY ENERGY

19:27.850 --> 19:28.987
TRYING TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS
THAT CROSBY MADE.

19:29.020 --> 19:31.716
HE CHEATED ON HIS FIANCEE.
IT DIRECTLY AFFECTED MAX.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.401
AND I DON'T CARE IF HE
DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT ANYBODY.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.850
HE DID,
JUST LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES!

19:35.890 --> 19:36.857
HE'S SELFISH.

19:36.890 --> 19:38.300
AND FOR YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,

19:38.340 --> 19:41.343
TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT
IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.826
- HONEY?

19:43.870 --> 19:45.792
HONEY?

19:51.010 --> 19:53.570
- FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.398
AND ONE, TWO, THREE,
AND FOUR.

19:56.430 --> 19:58.466
SHOULDERS, HEAD,
SPIRAL WALK.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.219
AND ONE, TWO, THREE,
AND FOUR,

20:01.260 --> 20:03.364
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.776
AND ONE, TWO, THREE,
AND FOUR--

20:04.820 --> 20:06.640
- HEY.
HEY.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.329
CAN I HAVE, LIKE,
A SECOND OF YOUR TIME?

20:08.370 --> 20:09.928
- I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF CLASS RIGHT NOW.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.828
- OKAY, WELL,
IT'S IMPORTANT.

20:13.860 --> 20:17.273
YOU--YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME.

20:17.310 --> 20:18.447
LISTEN...

20:18.490 --> 20:20.720
- DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

20:20.770 --> 20:21.998
- I JUST WANT, FOR ONE SECOND--
- NO, NO.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.905
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.805
YOU KNOW I'M BARELY HOLDING ON
RIGHT NOW?

20:25.840 --> 20:27.831
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
DO YOU?

20:27.880 --> 20:29.871
WHAT YOU DID TO ME
MAKES ME SICK.

20:29.910 --> 20:31.707
WHAT YOU DID TO OUR FAMILY
MAKES ME SICK.

20:31.740 --> 20:32.980
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO LOOK AT YOU.

20:33.020 --> 20:34.294
DON'T COME HERE AGAIN.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.673
DON'T COME HERE AGAIN.

20:36.710 --> 20:39.986
- [sighs]

20:40.030 --> 20:42.021
[door closes]

20:42.060 --> 20:43.857
- OKAY, MAX, LET'S BOOGIE.

20:43.890 --> 20:45.027
WE'RE LATE.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.583
- WHY ISN'T MOM TAKING ME
TO SCHOOL?

20:46.620 --> 20:49.339
- BECAUSE SHE HAS TO RUN
AN ERRAND WITH HADDIE.

20:49.380 --> 20:50.927
- THESE ARE THE WRONG SHOES.

20:50.970 --> 20:52.062
- MAX,
WE DON'T HAVE TIME, OKAY?

20:52.110 --> 20:53.657
- I WANT TO WEAR MY BLUE SHOES.
- JUST PUT THOSE ON.

20:54.870 --> 20:56.656
I NEED TO PUT MY BLUE SHOES ON.
- MAX, THESE ARE FINE.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.315
I WANT YOU T%8UT THESE ON.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.861
I NEED TO PUT MY BLUE SHOES ON!
- PUT THE BLACK SHOES ON.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.423
YOU DON'T NEED THE BLUE SHOES.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.836
- I NEED TO PUT
MY BLUE SHOES ON.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.529
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
WE'LL FIND THE BLUE SHOES.

21:04.570 --> 21:05.969
YOU WANT I158 HELP ME?

21:06.020 --> 21:07.533
- MAX, YOU'RE TELLING ME

ALL RIGHT, HERE THEY ARE.
LOOK AT THAT.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.814
HERE ARE YOUR BLUE SHOES.

21:10.850 --> 21:13.739
[sighs]

21:20.900 --> 21:21.969
MAX, WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

21:22.000 --> 21:23.581
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO
TO SCHOOL TODAY?

21:23.620 --> 21:24.928
- BUT I DO.
IT'S THURSDAY.

21:24.970 --> 21:26.062
- YOU DON'T.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.725
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO SCHOOL TODAY.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.580
- YES, I DO.
IT'S THURSDAY.

21:29.630 --> 21:30.790
- WHAT IF,
INSTEAD OF GOING TO SCHOOL,

21:30.840 --> 21:32.728
YOU AND I GO
TO GALAXY POINT PARK

21:32.770 --> 21:34.078
AND RIDE ROLLER COASTERS
ALL DAY LONG?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.315
JUST YOU AND ME.
HOW'S THAT FOR A SURPRISE?

21:36.360 --> 21:38.396
COME ON.
- I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.421
- OKAY.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.912
REMEMBER THE VELOCERATOR--

21:43.950 --> 21:46.703
SCARIEST, FASTEST RIDE
IN ALL OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA?

21:46.750 --> 21:48.126
- YEAH, I KNOW.
IT SAYS SO ON THE POSTER.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.127
- THAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.809
YOU WANTED TO RIDE THAT,
LIKE, A DOZEN TIMES.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.088
- IT'S THE ONE
ON THE MOBIUS TRACK, RIGHT?

21:52.130 --> 21:53.097
- THAT'S RIGHT.

21:53.130 --> 21:54.927
- THE ONE THAT GOES
FORWARDS AND BACIONARDS?

21:54.960 --> 21:55.756
- THAT'S RIGHT.

21:55.790 --> 21:56.996
- CAN WE GO ON IT
MORE THAN ONCE?

21:57.030 --> 21:59.339
- WE CAN GO ON THE VELOCERATOR
AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT.

21:59.380 --> 22:00.517
WE'LL ONLY BREAK
FOR MEALS, OKAY?

22:00.560 --> 22:02.346
WE WILL GO ON THE VELOCERATOR
TILL THE PARK CLOSES.

22:02.390 --> 22:04.529
YOU MAY NEVER WANT TO GO
ON THE VELOCERATOR AGAIN.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.620
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

22:07.670 --> 22:08.830
- OKAY.

22:08.870 --> 22:09.837
- YES!
- YES!

22:09.880 --> 22:10.949
- ALL RIGHT!
- AWESOME!

22:15.500 --> 22:17.536
- SO LOUIS TELLS ME
YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MANAGING.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.980
- DEFINITELY.
- WHY?

22:19.020 --> 22:21.500
- WHY?
HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN CHEERS?

22:21.540 --> 22:22.677
OKAY?
[chuckles]

22:22.720 --> 22:25.473
WHAT LOOKS BETTER THAN,
UH, YOU KNOW, TED DANSON'S JOB?

22:25.510 --> 22:26.716
- WELL,
TED DANSON WAS THE OWNER.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.399
- RIGHT.

22:28.450 --> 22:29.712
THAT'S UP NEXT.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.648
NO, SERIOUSLY, I, UM--

22:31.690 --> 22:34.443
YOU KNOW, I'VE JUST SPENT A LOT
OF TIME BEING A BARTENDER,

22:34.490 --> 22:35.821
AND, UH, I THINK
I'D BE GOOD AT IT.

22:35.870 --> 22:37.098
I'M LOOKING TO EXPAND.

22:37.140 --> 22:38.243
- OKAY, BUT YOU DO KNOW

22:38.280 --> 22:40.840
THAT IT PAYS ABOUT 30%
LESS THAN BARTENDING, RIGHT?

22:40.870 --> 22:42.553
- NO.
- YEAH.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.522
YEAH, MANAGERS,
THEY DON'T TAKE HOME TIPS.

22:44.570 --> 22:46.379
SO YOU ACTUALLY GET A SALARY.

22:46.430 --> 22:48.398
AND I CAN GUARANTEE
YOUR CURRENT TAKE-HOME PAY

22:48.430 --> 22:49.874
IS GONNA GET HIT PRETTY HARD.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.876
- UM, HUH.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.127
- CAN I MAKE AN OBSERVATION?
- YEAH.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.980
- THE CUSTOMERS--
THEY ALL LOVE YOU, OKAY?

22:56.020 --> 22:57.669
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

22:57.720 --> 22:59.779
YOU CAN WORK AS MANY SHIFTS
AS YOU WANT, OKAY?

22:59.820 --> 23:02.129
YES, MAYBE SOMETIMES YOU'RE
A LITTLE ERRATIC, WHATEVER.

23:02.170 --> 23:05.549
YOU DON'T BRING ME DRAMA,
AND I LOVE THAT.

23:05.590 --> 23:08.514
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE A MANAGER.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.108
YOU KNOW, AND I'D HATE
TO SEE YOU GET BURNT OUT

23:10.140 --> 23:11.823
AFTER SIX MONTHS
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

23:11.870 --> 23:14.623
YOU HATE SCHEDULING
EVERYBODY'S SHIFTS.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.969
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

23:17.010 --> 23:19.046
- WELL, THANKS, PETE.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.048
- COME TO ME ANYTIME.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.185
- IT'S THIS WAY, DAD.
- ARE YOU SURE?

23:26.230 --> 23:28.084
- YES. NO, BUT FIRST
WE HAVE TO RIDE--

23:28.130 --> 23:31.816
NO. DAD! FIRST WE HAVE TO
RIDE THE FURY...

23:31.850 --> 23:33.852
[cell phone rings]

23:33.890 --> 23:35.050
- EXCUSE ME.
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING HERE?

23:35.100 --> 23:36.783
- HEY, HONEY.
- HEY, HONEY. HI.

23:36.820 --> 23:39.448
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
- YEAH. I'M RIGHT HERE.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.924
- WHERE ARE YOU?
I CAN BARELY HEAR YOU.

23:40.970 --> 23:42.995
- I AM AT GALAXY POINT PARK.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.621
- YOU'RE WHAT?

23:44.660 --> 23:45.752
- MAX AND I
ARE PLAYING HOOKY TODAY,

23:45.800 --> 23:46.960
SO WE CAME OUT
TO GALAXY POINT.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.864
WE'RE GONNA RIDE
THE VELOCERATOR.

23:48.910 --> 23:50.719
HEY, MAX, STAY CLOSE TO ME.
WHAT?

23:50.770 --> 23:52.692
- OKAY, ADAM, I DON'T THINK
THAT THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

23:52.740 --> 23:55.732
- I KNOW, HONEY, BUT WE'RE
HAVING A FANTASTIC TIME, OKAY?

23:55.770 --> 23:56.839
MAX.
- I NEED $6.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.973
- I SAY THIS OUT OF LOVE,
BUT YOU'VE GONE ROGUE.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.567
ADAM.
- YEAH?

24:00.610 --> 24:02.054
HONEY, LISTEN,
IT'S JUST ONE DAY, OKAY?

24:02.090 --> 24:03.193
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

24:03.230 --> 24:05.460
- IT IS A BIG DEAL.
WE HAVE TO STICK WITH THE PLAN.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.535
DR. PELICAN SAID
TO STICK WITH HIS ROUTINE,

24:07.580 --> 24:08.501
AND THIS IS NOT HIS ROUTINE.

24:08.550 --> 24:10.051
- KRISTINA, YOU AND I
HAVE BEEN PARENTS

24:10.100 --> 24:11.818
FOR THE EXACT SAME
AMOUNT OF TIME, OKAY?

24:11.860 --> 24:13.236
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

24:13.270 --> 24:15.830
IT'S UNDER CONTROL.
DON'T WORRY, ALL RIGHT?

24:15.860 --> 24:16.827
I LOVE YOU.
BYE.

24:16.860 --> 24:19.442
- HELLO?
- ALL RIGHT!

24:28.600 --> 24:30.704
- THAT IS SO COOL!

24:30.740 --> 24:32.708
HEY, DID YOU KNOW
THAT THE SIDEWINDER...

24:32.740 --> 24:34.879
IS AN INVERTED ELEMENT
ON A ROLLER COASTER

24:34.920 --> 24:37.502
WHERE IT MAKES A 90-DEGREE TURN
WHILE THE TRAIN IS INVERTED?

24:37.540 --> 24:38.746
- I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

24:38.780 --> 24:40.748
- AND THE FASTEST COASTER
IN THE WORLD IS IN ABU DHABI.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.783
IT GOES FROM ZERO
TO 150 MILES AN HOUR

24:43.820 --> 24:44.889
IN FOUR SECONDS.

24:44.930 --> 24:46.192
- WOW.
THAT IS FAST.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.639
- IF YOU SIT IN THE FRONT,

24:47.690 --> 24:49.658
YOU HAVE TO WEAR
PROTECTIVE GOGGLES.

24:49.690 --> 24:50.896
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME!

24:50.930 --> 24:52.101
WHOO!

24:52.140 --> 24:54.062
I JUST CAN'T WAIT.
I CAN'T WAIT.

24:54.110 --> 24:55.793
I CAN'T WAIT,
I CAN'T WAIT, I CAN'T WAIT.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.838
- HEY.
- HI!

24:58.870 --> 25:00.838
- HEY.
- HEY, HONEY.

25:00.870 --> 25:02.690
HEY, JABBAR, SYDNEY'S HERE.

25:02.740 --> 25:03.525
- HI, SYDNEY.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.526
- HI. I GOT
A NEW PRETTY ERASER.

25:05.570 --> 25:06.707
- OH, YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT.

25:06.740 --> 25:08.082
- AW, THANKS.
- THANK YOU.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.701
- IS THERE A SPECIAL OCCASION?

25:09.740 --> 25:11.742
- UH, IT IS OFFICIALLY
OUR EIGHTH--

25:11.780 --> 25:14.010
- EIGHTH DAY EATING NO SUGAR.

25:14.060 --> 25:16.290
- WOW.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.648
SO WE'RE CELEBRATING.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.307
WE'RE GOING
TO A RAW-FOOD RESTAURANT.

25:19.340 --> 25:20.716
- MMM. YES.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.886
- THAT'S--THAT'S REALLY HARD.

25:21.930 --> 25:23.579
- YES.
- GOOD FOR YOU GUYS.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.588
- I THINK IT'S THE FIRST DATE
WE'VE HAD ON A WEEKDAY

25:25.620 --> 25:26.723
SINCE, UH,
BEFORE SYDNEY WAS BORN.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.897
- NO, THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.555
- NO, I DON'T THINK
I AM EXAGGERATING.

25:29.590 --> 25:31.729
- YEAH, YOU ARE, BABE.
- WELL, REGARDLESS, THANK YOU.

25:31.770 --> 25:33.795
THIS--THIS IS FANTASTIC.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.102
- OKAY.

25:35.150 --> 25:37.596
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL PICK HER
UP FIRST THING IN THE MORNING?

25:37.630 --> 25:40.804
- YOU KNOW, ANYTIME.
I'M NOT WORKING TOMORROW, SO...

25:40.840 --> 25:44.298
HAVE FUN.
[laughs tearfully]

25:44.330 --> 25:45.672
- JASMINE.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.849
- I'M FINE.
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

25:47.890 --> 25:49.983
I'M FINE.

25:53.060 --> 25:55.824
HEY, GUYS, WHO WANTS
TO PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK

25:55.860 --> 25:57.304
ISRAELI ARMY STYLE?
- COME HERE. COME HERE.

25:57.340 --> 25:58.898
- I DO.
- YES?

25:58.930 --> 25:59.965
ALL RIGHT, HERE IT IS...

26:00.000 --> 26:01.820
- I'M SORRY.
- NO, DON'T BE SORRY.

26:01.870 --> 26:03.098
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- YOU GUYS SHOULD GO.

26:03.140 --> 26:04.004
I'M FINE.
I'LL BE OKAY.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.144
- HEY, WE ARE HERE NOW.
DON'T BE SILLY.

26:06.180 --> 26:07.761
WE CAN--WE CAN HANG OUT.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.210
- NO, BUT YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.935
AND H THOUGHT THIS WAS
A SPECIAL OCCASION FOR YOU TWO.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.186
- NO, WE WE'RE JUST
GONNA GO EAT.

26:13.220 --> 26:14.664
- REALLY?
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

26:14.710 --> 26:15.972
WE CAN GO EAT ANYTIME.

26:16.020 --> 26:18.011
- OKAY, UH, WHO HERE
WANTS SOME PIZZA?

26:18.050 --> 26:20.086
WHAT DO YOU GUYS LIKE ON IT--
BRUSSELS SPROUTS?

26:20.130 --> 26:21.631
- THANKS.
- OF COURSE.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.843
- YOU DON'T LIKE
BRUSSELS SPROUTS? THAT'S WEIRD.

26:27.930 --> 26:29.090
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

26:29.130 --> 26:31.712
WE'RE ACTUALLY
ON THE VELOCERATOR.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.648
WE'RE ON IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

26:33.690 --> 26:35.305
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.
- YES, YES IT IS.

26:35.350 --> 26:36.829
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY COOL.

26:36.870 --> 26:38.314
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MAKE SURE WE KEEP

26:38.350 --> 26:40.079
OUR HANDS AND ARMS
INSIDE AT ALL TIMES.

26:40.110 --> 26:41.839
YOU READY?

26:41.870 --> 26:43.007
- WHY ISN'T IT GOING?

26:43.040 --> 26:44.735
- WELL, THERE'S A FEW
MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO GET ON...

26:44.770 --> 26:47.352
- NO, IT SHOULD BE GOING
BY NOW.

26:47.390 --> 26:48.903
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:48.950 --> 26:52.158
- WE'RE SORRY, BUT
THE VELOCERATOR NEEDS REPAIRS

26:52.190 --> 26:56.229
AND WILL BE CLOSED
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

26:56.260 --> 26:57.887
- WHAT?

26:57.920 --> 27:00.980
- OKAY, LISTEN, MAX, THIS
IS SOMETHING WE DIDN'T PLAN ON,

27:01.030 --> 27:02.782
BUT WE HAVE TO GET OFF
THE RIDE NOW.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.993
- NO, WE DON'T. YOU SAID
WE WOULD RIDE THE VELOCERATOR

27:05.030 --> 27:06.406
AS MANY TIMES AS I WANTED.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.894
- I KNOW I DID,
BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE REPAIRS.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.067
- NO, YOU TOOK ME
OUT OF SCHOOL

27:09.110 --> 27:11.442
SO THAT WE COULD COME HERE
AND RIDE THE VELOCERATOR.

27:11.490 --> 27:14.653
WE CHANGED
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DAY

27:14.700 --> 27:15.860
TO COME HERE AND RIDE THIS.

27:15.910 --> 27:17.309
NO, WE HAVE TO RIDE IT!

27:17.350 --> 27:19.386
- THERE'S ANOTHER RIDE
RIGHT OVER THERE.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.830
- NO, I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER RIDE!

27:21.880 --> 27:23.734
I WANT TO RIDE
THE VELOCERATOR!

27:23.780 --> 27:26.419
IT'S NOT FAIR! IT'S NOT FAIR!
- MAX, HEY, HEY, HEY.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.085
- IT'S NOT FAIR!

27:28.120 --> 27:29.985
- MAX! EXCUSE ME.
MAX!

27:30.020 --> 27:31.772
- IT'S NOT FAIR!
- MAX!

27:31.820 --> 27:32.775
-AAH!

27:32.820 --> 27:34.788
- MAX, HEY.
EXCUSE ME.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.787
MAX.
MAX, HEY, HEY, HEY.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.162
- IT'S NOT FAIR!
YOU PROMISED!

27:37.200 --> 27:39.953
- MAX, IT'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT?
- YOU PROMISED...

27:40.000 --> 27:43.299
WE WOULD GO ON THE VELOCERATOR
AS MANY TIMES AS I WANTED!

27:43.350 --> 27:46.376
- IT BROKE DOWN.
I CAN'T--HEY, MAX!

27:46.420 --> 27:48.240
- YOU SAID!

27:48.280 --> 27:50.840
AAH!

27:53.180 --> 27:56.695
- YOU'RE OKAY.
YOU'RE OKAY.

28:03.160 --> 28:06.323
[rock music playing]
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

28:06.370 --> 28:07.189
HEY.

28:07.230 --> 28:09.289
- UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON MY BOAT?

28:09.340 --> 28:10.819
- COME ON, SIR, COULD YOU JUST
LOWER THE MUSIC

28:10.860 --> 28:11.929
A LITTLE BIT, PLEASE, HUH?

28:11.960 --> 28:13.234
IT'S BEEN GOING ALL NIGHT.

28:13.270 --> 28:15.204
- I DON'T THINK
I INVITED YOU ON MY BOAT.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.275
- HEY, OTHER PEOPLE LIVE HERE.

28:16.310 --> 28:18.369
HOW ABOUT JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF CONSIDERATION?

28:18.420 --> 28:20.376
NO, NO, THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD, YEAH.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.035
- WHY DON'T YOU TURN
YOUR ASS AROUND

28:22.070 --> 28:22.934
AND GO BACK TO YOUR BOAT?

28:22.970 --> 28:24.722
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.169
- I THINK YOU'RE ON MY BOAT,
SO I THINK I'LL TALK TO YOU

28:26.220 --> 28:28.973
HOW I WANT!
GET OFF MY BOAT!

28:31.290 --> 28:34.179
- COME ON, MOUTH.
COME ON.

28:39.090 --> 28:43.026
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

28:54.110 --> 28:56.249
- I PAID YOUR BAIL.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.798
- I MESSED UP.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.833
- YEAH, YOU DID.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.973
- I MEAN...

29:08.020 --> 29:09.567
I REALLY MESSED UP.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.569
[dramatic music]

29:23.340 --> 29:26.093
- HE'S ASLEEP.

29:26.140 --> 29:27.471
- THAT'S GOOD.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.967
THAT'S GOOD.

29:31.010 --> 29:33.035
[exhales deeply]
- I'M SORRY, KRISTINA.

29:33.080 --> 29:36.049
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.830
- YOU WERE THINKING

29:39.880 --> 29:41.142
YOU WANTED TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME WITH YOUR SON

29:41.190 --> 29:43.977
AND CONNECT WITH HIM,
AND YOU DID. YOU DID.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.499
- I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE,

29:45.540 --> 29:47.292
AND HE HAD TO HAVE
HIS PARTICULAR PAIR OF SHOES,

29:47.330 --> 29:49.298
AND I...

29:49.330 --> 29:53.334
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO FEEL LIMITED, YOU KNOW?

29:53.370 --> 29:55.304
AND I...

29:55.340 --> 29:57.137
[voice breaking] I JUST WANTED
TO FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING

29:57.170 --> 29:58.398
FOR ONE DAMN DAY,
YOU KNOW?

29:58.450 --> 30:01.965
AND SHOW HIM THAT WE COULD GO
OUT AND HAVE A HAPPY MEMORY.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.036
- IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.868
- YOU KNOW, I JUST DIDN'T WANT
HIM TO FEEL SO ALONE.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.959
- HE HAD FUN.

30:09.010 --> 30:13.356
- WHY AM I NOT STRONG?

30:13.390 --> 30:15.017
- HERE.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.083
- ANYWAY,
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.055
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD...

30:23.090 --> 30:26.332
TRY TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN
ABOUT HIS ASPERGER'S.

30:26.370 --> 30:29.089
- OKAY. I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

30:29.130 --> 30:32.099
- WE CAN USE
THE PELICAN SCRIPT...

30:34.210 --> 30:36.371
AS A GUIDE.
- [laughs]

30:36.420 --> 30:38.991
OKAY, AS A GUIDE.
- [sighs]

30:40.970 --> 30:43.416
YOU'RE A GREAT DAD.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.667
- I HAVE MY MOMENTS.

30:45.700 --> 30:49.045
- YOU'RE A GREAT DAD.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.900
- YEAH.

31:00.030 --> 31:00.883
- SARAH, HI.
- AAH!

31:00.920 --> 31:02.057
- OH, HI.
- OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

31:02.100 --> 31:04.500
- I'M SORRY. I WAS--I WAS ABOUT
TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

31:04.550 --> 31:05.403
I DIDN'T GET THERE.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.884
- THIS IS NOT THE DOOR
WHERE YOU KNOCK.

31:06.930 --> 31:08.545
THAT IS THE DOOR.

31:08.590 --> 31:10.239
- I DON'T KNOW WHICH DOOR
IS THE RIGHT DOOR.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.032
THIS COMING FROM THE CAT BURGLAR
OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.550
- THE CAT BURGLAR WORKED DURING
THE DAY--THAT'S NOT SCARY.

31:14.590 --> 31:16.273
- YOU KNOW, I GET A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT IN THE DAYTIME.

31:16.320 --> 31:20.279
I CAME BY TO RETURN
YOUR READING MATERIAL.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.185
- OH.

31:22.220 --> 31:25.041
- I'M--I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED.

31:25.090 --> 31:27.149
IJUST, UM...

31:27.190 --> 31:29.010
I JUST THOUGHT I'D...
- NO.

31:29.050 --> 31:31.120
- I DON'T KNOW--
JUST COME BY.

31:31.160 --> 31:33.299
IT'S NOT REALLY ANY FUN TO TALK
ABOUT WRITING OVER THE PHONE.

31:33.330 --> 31:35.150
- RIGHT. THIS IS GONNA BE
A LOT OF FUN.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.293
I CAN TELL.
SO HAVE A SEAT.

31:37.340 --> 31:40.093
- THIS IS GOOD.
UM, SO...

31:40.130 --> 31:41.609
- SO LET ME JUST SAVE YOU.

31:41.650 --> 31:42.787
UH, IF I REMEMBER
HOW THIS GOES,

31:42.830 --> 31:45.446
IS YOU START OFF WITH TWO
OR THREE KIND OF GENERIC,

31:45.480 --> 31:47.243
POSITIVE COMMENTS
ABOUT MY WRITING,

31:47.280 --> 31:49.168
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE ME
FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

31:49.210 --> 31:50.199
AND THEN YOU FOLLOW THOSE UP

31:50.250 --> 31:53.003
WITH TWO OR THREE
SUPER-SPECIFIC CRITICISMS

31:53.040 --> 31:54.382
WHICH ARE SO SOUL CRUSHING,

31:54.420 --> 31:57.309
BECAUSE I REALIZE IN THAT MOMENT
HOW TRUE THEY ARE,

31:57.360 --> 31:59.180
SO IF YOU WANT TO JUST SKIP
TO THOSE,

31:59.220 --> 32:00.664
THAT'S FINE, 'CAUSE I PROBABLY
WON'T REMEMBER

32:00.710 --> 32:02.496
THE POSITIVE COMMENTS
BY THAT TIME ANYWAY,

32:02.540 --> 32:05.941
PROVIDED THERE ARE ANY,
WHICH MAY BE TOO HOPEFUL.

32:05.990 --> 32:06.979
[sighs]
WHAT?

32:07.020 --> 32:09.500
- NOTHING.
YOU JUST, UH...

32:09.540 --> 32:12.236
YOU JUST REDUCED MY LIFE'S WORK
AS AN ENGLISH TEACHER,

32:12.270 --> 32:14.022
SO I'M FEELING
A-A LITTLE UNNERVED.

32:14.070 --> 32:15.503
- OH, GOD.
- I'LL GET OVER IT.

32:15.550 --> 32:17.404
- NO, NO, I'M SORRY.
I'M AN IDIOT. I'M SO SORRY.

32:17.450 --> 32:18.997
- NO, IT WAS IMPRESSIVE.
- I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.689
BUT I CAN TAKE IT,
SO I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.755
THANK YOU. GO AHEAD,
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO SAY.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.449
- OKAY. ARE YOU SURE?
YES.

32:24.490 --> 32:27.698
- OKAY.
SO, UH, WELL, FIRSTLY...

32:27.730 --> 32:30.005
- OH, I'M SORRY. I JUST DON'T
WANT TO BE IN THIS CHAIR,

32:30.050 --> 32:31.620
'CAUSE IT JUST IS NOT--
I JUST WANT TO SIT...

32:31.670 --> 32:33.012
- OKAY.

32:33.050 --> 32:34.210
- I JUST WANT TO BE
SO I CAN REALLY...

32:34.260 --> 32:35.978
- YEAH.
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE FOR YOU.

32:36.020 --> 32:40.229
UM, SO MY MAIN IMPRESSION
IS THAT IT'S NOT A STORY.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.579
- OKAY. I KNOW.
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN.

32:41.610 --> 32:43.089
- SARAH.
SARAH, SHUT UP.

32:43.130 --> 32:44.745
PLEASE, SHUT UP.
- NO, I CAN'T.

32:44.790 --> 32:46.337
IT JUST--
IT CAME OUT LIKE, "BLAH."

32:46.370 --> 32:48.019
- SARAH, PLEASE,
STOP, STOP, STOP.

32:48.060 --> 32:49.994
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS BAD.
IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT A STORY.

32:50.030 --> 32:52.544
IT'S MORE OF A PLAY, OKAY?

32:52.590 --> 32:54.729
YOUR CHARACTERS ARE--
ARE FRESH.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.172
THEIR VOICES ARE--
ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR,

32:57.210 --> 33:00.031
AND ALL OF THE ACTION
IS TOLD THROUGH THE DIALOGUE,

33:00.080 --> 33:03.072
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY,
IS INCREDIBLY FUNNY.

33:03.110 --> 33:05.806
- IT IS?
- YEAH, IT IS.

33:05.840 --> 33:09.082
NOW, I-I-I DO HAVE
TWO CRITICISMS.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.009
SO THE FIRST ONE
IS YOUR HANDWRITING'S READABLE,

33:12.050 --> 33:13.324
BUT I THINK
FOR YOUR NEXT DRAFT,

33:13.370 --> 33:15.258
YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY TYPE
YOUR WORK.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.018
- TYPE IT. YEAH.
OKAY, AND?

33:17.060 --> 33:20.439
- AND, TWO,
YOU HAVE TO FINISH IT.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.813
YOU NEED ACT TWO.

33:23.860 --> 33:27.159
AND, UM...

33:27.210 --> 33:29.724
AND THAT'S IT.

33:31.690 --> 33:32.827
- THAT'S IT?

33:32.870 --> 33:35.691
- YEAH.

33:35.730 --> 33:39.314
IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.567
SO...

33:43.150 --> 33:45.289
CONGRATULATIONS,
SARAH BRAVERMAN.

33:45.330 --> 33:48.299
YOU ARE A PLAYWRIGHT.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.166
WAS IT HARD TO DO?

33:54.200 --> 33:56.782
- UM, NO, I MEAN,
THAT'S THE THING.

33:56.820 --> 34:00.779
IT JUST KIND OF...

34:00.830 --> 34:03.344
NO.

34:03.380 --> 34:06.349
NO.
- WOW.

34:07.730 --> 34:11.211
- SO JUST--I'M SORRY.
JUST TO BE CLEAR.

34:13.490 --> 34:14.878
YOU LIKED IT?

34:14.910 --> 34:16.559
- YES.

34:16.600 --> 34:20.707
I REALLY DID.

34:20.740 --> 34:24.562
- THAT'S JUST...

34:24.610 --> 34:28.091
- IT'S BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN.

34:31.550 --> 34:34.519
WELL, I GUESS I'LL, UH--

34:34.550 --> 34:37.678
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, SARAH.

34:37.730 --> 34:40.619
- I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, MARK.

34:40.660 --> 34:43.106
- ALL RIGHT.

34:53.470 --> 34:56.325
- HEY.

35:03.170 --> 35:06.469
THANK YOU.

35:06.510 --> 35:08.819
- YOU'RE--YOU'RE WELCOME.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.640
- SO, BUDDY,
DO YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR

35:44.690 --> 35:46.419
WHEN YOU WENT
TO OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY

35:46.450 --> 35:47.894
TO GET MORE COMFORTABLE
IN YOUR BODY?

35:47.930 --> 35:49.898
REMEMBER THAT?
- MM-HMM.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.829
- AND YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH GABY

35:52.870 --> 35:55.839
AND SHE'S BEEN HELPING YOU LEARN
HOW TO PLAY WITH OTHER KIDS?

35:55.870 --> 35:57.838
- YEAH.

35:57.870 --> 36:00.703
- WELL, YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
SO HARD AT THESE THINGS

36:00.740 --> 36:02.947
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME.

36:02.980 --> 36:05.801
- YOU GUYS
ALREADY TOLD ME THAT.

36:05.850 --> 36:07.943
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

36:07.990 --> 36:11.221
YEAH, WE DID, BUT WHAT
WE HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO DO

36:11.270 --> 36:13.886
IS TO TELL YOU
ABOUT ALL THE SPECIAL ABILITIES

36:13.930 --> 36:16.888
THAT PEOPLE
WITH ASPERGER'S HAVE...

36:16.930 --> 36:20.684
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU HAVE AN AMAZING MEMORY.

36:20.730 --> 36:24.962
AND YOU HAVE READ EVERY BOOK
EVER WRITTEN ABOUT PIRATES.

36:25.010 --> 36:27.387
AND YOU'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT INSECTS.

36:27.420 --> 36:29.524
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO MEMORIZE EVERY FACT

36:29.560 --> 36:31.380
ABOUT EVERY INSECT.

36:31.430 --> 36:34.638
AND THAT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF THE ASPERGER'S.

36:34.670 --> 36:35.830
- BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS

36:35.880 --> 36:39.008
THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE
CHALLENGING FOR YOU AS WELL.

36:39.050 --> 36:41.917
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU HAD
TO LEARN TO REMEMBER

36:41.950 --> 36:44.646
TO LOOK INTO PEOPLE'S EYES
WHEN THEY'RE TALKING TO YOU

36:44.680 --> 36:46.671
OR TO SMILE AT SOMEONE

36:46.720 --> 36:49.575
WHEN YOU MEET THEM
FOR THE FIRST TIME

36:49.620 --> 36:53.329
OR TO STAY CALM IF SOMEBODY
HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA THAN YOU.

36:53.380 --> 36:55.416
AND, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES THESE THINGS

36:55.450 --> 36:57.896
COME A LITTLE BIT EASIER
TO OTHER KIDS,

36:57.930 --> 36:59.932
BUT YOU'VE REALLY HAD
TO WORK AT THEM.

36:59.970 --> 37:02.768
- AND WE KNOW HOW HARD
YOU'VE WORKED TO LEARN THEM.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.791
- YOU'RE A ROCK STAR.

37:07.050 --> 37:09.769
- WILL I ALWAYS HAVE IT?

37:14.920 --> 37:17.809
- YES.

37:17.850 --> 37:20.057
YEAH, YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE
AN AMAZING MEMORY,

37:20.090 --> 37:21.569
AND YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE PASSIONATE

37:21.610 --> 37:23.498
ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN.

37:23.550 --> 37:26.064
AND THOSE SOCIAL SKILLS
THAT YOUR MOM MENTIONED,

37:26.100 --> 37:27.089
THOSE WILL ALWAYS BE THINGS

37:27.140 --> 37:29.279
THAT YOU JUST HAVE
TO REMIND YOURSELF ABOUT.

37:29.310 --> 37:31.039
- I ACTUALLY HAVE
A COUPLE OF BOOKS HERE

37:31.070 --> 37:34.938
DAD AND I HAVE BEEN READING
THAT TALK ABOUT AUTISM,

37:34.970 --> 37:37.552
AND THIS ONE HERE
WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY A BOY

37:37.600 --> 37:38.931
WHO'S A COUPLE
YEARS OLDER THAN YOU

37:38.980 --> 37:41.005
WHO HAS ASPERGER'S SYNDROME.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.938
IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING BOOK,

37:42.980 --> 37:45.835
AND, UH, WE WILL SIT AND READ
THESE WITH YOU IF YOU WANT.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.871
OR IF YOU WANT TO READ THEM
BY YOURSELF

37:47.920 --> 37:49.706
AND ASK US QUESTIONS.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.741
WE'RE LEARNING TOGETHER,
ALL OF US.

37:51.780 --> 37:53.839
SO THIS IS ALL NEW FOR US TOO.

37:55.820 --> 37:57.572
- WE'RE PROUD OF YOU, MAX.

37:57.620 --> 37:59.884
- SO PROUD.
- EVERY DAY.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.925
- I WANT TO GO
PLAY BUG WARONLINE.

38:04.970 --> 38:07.063
- [chuckles]

38:07.110 --> 38:08.065
OKAY.

38:08.110 --> 38:09.828
- GO AHEAD.
- OKAY.

38:09.870 --> 38:12.100
- 30 MINUTES.
- 45.

38:12.150 --> 38:15.836
- 30.
- FINE.

38:15.870 --> 38:17.690
- I LOVE YOU.

38:23.990 --> 38:28.393
- WELL.
- I DIDN'T CRY.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.884
- YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.048
- YOU DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

38:33.100 --> 38:35.136
- YOU'RE A GOOD MOM,
GREAT MOM.

38:35.170 --> 38:37.718
- THANKS.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.376
I DIDN'T CRY.

38:40.420 --> 38:41.899
- ONE, TWO, THREE.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.898
- WHAT?

38:44.940 --> 38:46.862
BAM, OUT OF THE PLACE.

38:46.910 --> 38:48.764
- YOU KNOCKED ME OUT.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.142
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I PLAY WITH YOU.

38:50.180 --> 38:52.876
- SORRY.
TWO SORRIES.

38:52.910 --> 38:55.049
- I THINK YOU CHEAT.

38:55.090 --> 38:57.809
MM-HMM.

38:57.850 --> 38:59.738
- MOMMY SAYS
YOU NEED TO STAY HERE

38:59.780 --> 39:02.817
BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING
ON THE BOAT.

39:02.850 --> 39:04.431
- UM...
[clears throat]

39:04.480 --> 39:06.926
YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.088
- WHEN WILL YOU BE DONE
AND COME HOME?

39:10.140 --> 39:13.780
- WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
A WHILE, BUDDY.

39:13.830 --> 39:16.936
UH, I HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

39:19.870 --> 39:21.929
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE?

39:21.980 --> 39:23.663
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED?

39:23.700 --> 39:26.908
- PUNCH, PUNCH, PUNCH.

39:26.950 --> 39:30.943
- I'M GONNA PUNCH, PUNCH YOU.

39:32.850 --> 39:38.959
- AND THE WHOLE WORLD
IS ON YOUR CASE

39:38.990 --> 39:42.403
I COULD OFFER YOU
A WARM EMBRACE

39:42.440 --> 39:44.886
- HI.

39:44.930 --> 39:46.966
- I NEED TO, UH...

39:47.000 --> 39:51.687
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

39:51.730 --> 39:54.039
- OKAY.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.068
- I WILL NEVER CHEAT ON YOU.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.838
- JOEL.

40:01.880 --> 40:05.464
- HONEY, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH,

40:05.500 --> 40:07.559
AND...

40:07.610 --> 40:10.989
WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH
SO MUCH MORE, YOU KNOW,

40:11.020 --> 40:12.908
GOOD AND BAD.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.088
WE'RE JUST--WE'RE GONNA GO
THROUGH EVERYTHING.

40:19.550 --> 40:22.201
AND I WILL NEVER...

40:22.240 --> 40:24.037
I WILL NEVER CHEAT ON YOU.

40:25.940 --> 40:29.103
- COME HERE.

40:29.150 --> 40:34.520
I'VE KNOWN IT
FROM THE MOMENT THAT WE MET

40:34.570 --> 40:36.709
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

40:36.740 --> 40:39.538
THAT YOU BELONG

40:41.230 --> 40:47.783
I'D GO HUNGRY,
I GO BLACK AND BLUE

40:47.820 --> 40:53.850
I GO CRAWLING
DOWN THE AVENUE

40:53.890 --> 40:59.795
NO, THERE'S NOTHING
THAT I WOULDN'T DO

40:59.830 --> 41:04.073
TO MAKE YOU FEEL MY LOVE

41:16.880 --> 41:18.848
- "'HEARD THE NEWS?" HE SAID.

41:18.890 --> 41:20.846
"THERE'S NOTHING ELSE BEING
TALKED ABOUT

41:20.890 --> 41:23.029
"ALL ALONG THE RIVERBANK.

41:23.060 --> 41:26.268
"TOAD WENT UP TO TOWN
BY AN EARLY TRAIN THIS MORNING,

41:26.310 --> 41:30.963
AND HE'S ORDERED A VERY LARGE
AND VERY EXPENSIVE MOTOR CAR."'

41:31.000 --> 41:35.755
- THE STORMS ARE RAGING
ON THE ROLLING SEAS

41:35.800 --> 41:37.654
- MAX?

41:37.700 --> 41:43.559
- AND ON THE HIGHWAY
OF REGRET

41:43.600 --> 41:49.288
THE WINDS OF CHANGE
ARE BLOWING WILD AND FREE

41:49.330 --> 41:55.155
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING
LIKE ME YET...

41:55.200 --> 41:57.748
- "THE MOLE HAD LONG WANTED

41:57.790 --> 41:59.337
"TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE
OF THE BADGER.

41:59.370 --> 42:04.649
BUT WHENEVER HE MENTIONED
HIS WISH TO..."

42:04.690 --> 42:08.308
HE ALWAYS FOUND HIMSELF
PUT OFF."

42:08.350 --> 42:14.835
- GO TO THE ENDS
OF THE EARTH FOR YOU

42:14.870 --> 42:20.945
TO MAKE YOU FEEL MY LOVE

42:20.980 --> 42:26.941
TO MAKE YOU FEEL MY LOVE
