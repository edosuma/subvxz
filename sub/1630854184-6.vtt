[Scoffs] One sob story
about his birth,

48:55.715 --> 48:57.673
and you're back to
eating from his hand.

48:57.804 --> 49:00.111
She's just stubborn.

49:00.241 --> 49:01.590
She is a wall.

49:01.721 --> 49:03.244
And it's very clear that

49:03.375 --> 49:05.551
the family is not
functioning well,

49:05.681 --> 49:08.597
that there is something very,
very screwed up

49:08.728 --> 49:10.338
about the dynamics here.

49:10.469 --> 49:13.602
It's not fun, it's not pleasant,
but you endure the years

49:13.733 --> 49:16.649
because you cannot have
relations with humanity.

49:16.779 --> 49:18.607
We are only stuck with
ourselves.

49:18.738 --> 49:20.435
Claudia: I've been having
a thought

49:20.566 --> 49:21.741
the last few days, Louis.

49:21.871 --> 49:23.090
Louis: Yeah? What's that?

49:23.221 --> 49:25.179
Claudia: I am done enduring.

49:25.310 --> 49:28.182
The chess scene is quite
interesting, it's based off

49:28.313 --> 49:31.490
a very famous, uh, chess game
called the Polish Immortal.

49:31.620 --> 49:34.014
Basically, it's a series of
moves by one opponent

49:34.145 --> 49:35.668
that sort of lures in a person

49:35.798 --> 49:37.626
who wants everything in
the world,

49:37.757 --> 49:39.759
wants to take everything,
and she can see

49:39.889 --> 49:41.413
this is the way into Lestat.

49:41.543 --> 49:44.546
Stonewalling again,
you've become quite predictable,

49:44.677 --> 49:46.200
my sister, disappointment.

49:46.331 --> 49:48.333
She is slowly suckering him in.

49:48.463 --> 49:51.379
And she is wise enough to
kind of look at the landscape

49:51.510 --> 49:54.513
and go, "There's only one way to
do it, we have to kill him."

49:54.643 --> 49:56.776
Claudia: I can kill 'im.

49:56.906 --> 49:59.213
Jones: She, through this chess
game, sees it's possible.

49:59.344 --> 50:00.954
"We could do it,
we can out-think him

50:01.085 --> 50:02.695
if we know his weaknesses."

50:02.825 --> 50:05.698
You're giving up bishops
and knights for pawns.

50:05.828 --> 50:09.963
♪

50:10.094 --> 50:12.705
And she just needs Louis to be
on board for it.

50:12.835 --> 50:14.446
Claudia: The secret is, Louis...

50:14.576 --> 50:16.230
Queen on one side...

50:16.361 --> 50:18.537
Claudia: ...you want to kill
him, too.

50:18.667 --> 50:21.192
And you will enjoy
doing it.

50:21.322 --> 50:23.977
You've won.

50:26.458 --> 50:31.724
Louis: She was right,
we were going to kill Lestat.
