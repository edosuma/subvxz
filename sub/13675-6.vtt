00:23.357 --> 00:24.608
And before we ask the first question,

00:24.692 --> 00:26.853
| just have to tell you that
in my little hot hands,

00:26.944 --> 00:30.232
I have not one, but two tickets,
wow,

00:30.448 --> 00:33.861
to the Krewe of Endymion's
Endymion Extravaganza in the Superdome.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.158
So, if you want them, start calling right now.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.200
And Don...

00:37.288 --> 00:39.745
DON: Okay, Monica's given me
the first question here, Kevin.

00:39.832 --> 00:41.368
And I'm gonna make this real easy

00:41.459 --> 00:43.040
for you in New Orleans,

it might actually be brilliant.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.035
| see lrma doing that one.

04:53.169 --> 04:54.158
You got Irma?

04:55.754 --> 04:56.743
But I'm working on it.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.500
And who else?

04:58.883 --> 05:02.467
Robert Parker, "Frogman," Frankie Ford,

that's still standing.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.470

05:06.807 --> 05:08.638
Well, first, we gotta get it on record.

05:08.726 --> 05:12.264
Right now, I got my aunt's backing
to put out a single disc of the best tracks.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.855
She's even agreed to forgo the label's cut

05:13.939 --> 05:15.679
so that we can deliver
some of this cash money

05:15.774 --> 05:17.685

-Yeah.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.571
The thing is,

05:22.573 --> 05:25.235
I need some big numbers, some anthems,

05:25.910 --> 05:27.195
some 11:00 numbers.

05:27.286 --> 05:31.746
And after all this writing and arranging,
I'm just kind of burnt.

So...

05:38.255 --> 05:39.415
You wanna write together?

I can tell
you didn't practice on your own, though.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.422
You came in here
without the melody in your head

07:09.513 --> 07:10.923
until you got with Cherise.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.505
Took me a bit to get the hang of it.

07:12.725 --> 07:14.716
Yeah, well, you got there.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.058
Going again, one more time.

07:16.145 --> 07:19.228
I gotta go, Mr. Batiste.
I need to give my brother his lunch money.

07:19.315 --> 07:20.521
Well, when you get home,
I want you to play this

07:20.608 --> 07:22.394
with your eyes closed, hear?

07:22.484 --> 07:23.769
Don't look at the music.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.853
I want you to play with your whole body,
notjust your fingers and your eyes.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.692
-Not my fingers?
-That's right.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.524
Why do you think musicians are always
wearing sunglasses on stage?

07:31.702 --> 07:33.567
-'Cause they high?
-No.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.279
So they can't see their fingers and their eyes.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.625
-Nobody can see their own eyes.
-Musicians can.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.825
CHERISE: Bye, Mr. Batiste.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.161
Okay.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.964
Now see, here is where the music changes.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.298
This is a ballad. It's a story song.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.262
Words and music coming together.

07:54.767 --> 07:57.099
And the music actually kind of helps
to tell the story.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.972
See what I mean? Huh?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.098
The great ones,

08:01.190 --> 08:04.774
they hear it all in their head at the same time
and put it together.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.066
All right.

08:06.153 --> 08:10.738
Now how do the lyrics tell you
how to phrase the song?

08:14.828 --> 08:18.036
How do the words tell you how to play?

08:23.420 --> 08:25.627
Go ahead, girl. Don't be shy.

08:28.384 --> 08:31.968
WOMAN: Chemotherapy produces a fall
in the number of blood cells.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.214
There'll be significant hair loss

08:33.305 --> 08:35.637
within two to three weeks
of the first treatment.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.715
You'll experience all the routine side effects,

08:37.810 --> 08:40.552
constipation, fatigue, nausea, vomiting.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.054
But that is temporary.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.982
-How temporary?
-|t's difficult to predict.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.443
Between sessions of chemo,
you'll gradually feel better.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.354
Then it's time for another one, huh?

08:53.617 --> 08:56.359
I'll make your appointment
with the outpatient chemo clinic.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.739
After that,
you can reschedule with them directly.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.287
Not before Mardi Gras.

09:00.416 --> 09:03.749
Mr. Lambreaux, we need to be aggressive
with your treatment...

09:03.836 --> 09:05.372
Ash Wednesday or later.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.619
I'm not arguing with you, Doc.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.253
-I know.
-You know?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.209
I'm saying she can't read,
not she can't read music.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.431
I'm saying she can't read her damn ABCs.

09:16.515 --> 09:17.880
She plays by ear, I know.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.182
As far as coping mechanisms go,
she's doing pretty damn well.

-ANTO|NE: But she can't read.
-(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

09:21.937 --> 09:24.394
How does a kid get to the seventh grade
and not learn how to read?

09:24.481 --> 09:27.268
She's not the first.
Believe me, she won't be the last.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.974
Does the school know?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.027
Jesus, Lord.
Ain't anybody gonna do nothing about it?

09:32.197 --> 09:34.483
I can't speak to her other classes, Antoine.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.486
But the only reason
she's still coming to school

09:36.577 --> 09:38.033
is because of band.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.532
We take that away,
we're likely to lose her altogether.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.663
But she needs...

09:43.751 --> 09:45.833
Look, head down to the front office.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.122
Talk to the vice-principal.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.829
But she ain't gonna tell you
what you hope to hear, Antoine.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.588
And you witnessed all that
on or about the same evening, Mr. Geary?

09:58.682 --> 09:59.842
Idid.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.933
Wilson whipped that boy's ass.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.931
Cuffed him to a light pole,

10:05.022 --> 10:07.229
went in the bar and had a drink,

10:07.524 --> 10:10.231
then came out
and whipped the boy's ass some more.

10:11.445 --> 10:15.859
Did you make any attempt
to notify any authorities

10:15.949 --> 10:17.450
about what you had seen?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.195
Anyone from the police department?

10:19.369 --> 10:21.405
You know the NOPD wouldn't
have done a damn thing

10:21.497 --> 10:23.158
other than come after me

10:23.248 --> 10:24.909
for making a complaint
on one of their officers.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.581
Shit.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.459
If you can stayjust a little longer,

10:29.546 --> 10:32.834
I'll have my assistant get on the computer
and type up your statement.

10:32.925 --> 10:35.337
If you can read it back and sign it,
I'll be able to run you home.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.585
-You mind?
-Okay.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.888
Mr. Geary, lwanna thank you
for calling on the ad.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.398
And I promise we won't make anything public,

10:51.485 --> 10:54.101
unless I've got
half a dozen documented complaints

10:54.196 --> 10:55.686
against Officer Wilson.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.825
Ma'am, you do what you have to do.

10:58.909 --> 11:02.447
You know, I did one tour in Afghanistan,
a tour in Iraq.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.072
What the hell that asshole gonna show me
that I ain't already seen, right?

11:06.250 --> 11:09.037
EVERETT: You don't recall any case like that?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.329
Well, let me ask you, Doctor,

11:10.420 --> 11:13.002
were there any cases
that you did handle down here

11:13.090 --> 11:16.878
in which the ruling on manner of death
gave you any concern?

11:18.095 --> 11:19.210
Nada.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.672
l have depositions for paying clients
this afternoon,

11:22.766 --> 11:25.348
but if you still have calls to make tomorrow,
I'll split them with you.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.972
Thanks,
but I'm pretty much down to the last clips.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.769
Looks to be a waste of three weeks,
to be honest.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.815
-Well, it was a good idea in theory.
-In theory, yeah.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.516
Yes, sir, I understand.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.353
And did anyone else from your office
come to New Orleans that fall

11:37.447 --> 11:38.903
or was it just you?

11:39.283 --> 11:42.320
She came to us
with a profound learning disability,

11:42.494 --> 11:45.236
one that wasn't addressed at any point.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.911
Theyjust passed her along?

11:47.708 --> 11:49.494
We've spoken to her mother in great detail,

11:49.585 --> 11:51.667
urged her to consider
a school with more resources.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.205
Y'all can't get her what she needs here?

11:53.297 --> 11:54.503
-RSD?
-Uh-huh.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.622
Not even close.

11:57.134 --> 12:00.126
Special needs students require resources
that don't exist anymore.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.880
So what are we saying here?

12:02.139 --> 12:05.427
Jennifer's coming to school,
she isn't a disciplinary problem,

12:05.517 --> 12:07.257
and she enjoys band class a great deal.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.639
It's as good as it gets, huh?

12:09.938 --> 12:12.054
Would you rather
have her leave school entirely?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.688
We're doing what's possible.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.812
Then let's get her somewhere else.
Somewhere that can help.

12:17.029 --> 12:20.396
Well, for that, her mother would have to
assert herself at one of the charter schools.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.573
And getting a special needs student
into one of the charters...

12:23.660 --> 12:25.321
Well, that's problematic for other reasons.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.916
As for undocumented workers,
our policy is very clear.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.494
No one without a verifiable and valid
social security card

12:35.589 --> 12:38.251
will be allowed to work in this restaurant
at any time.

12:38.592 --> 12:42.631
Full documentation must be provided
before any kitchen worker or server clocks in.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.047
But post-Katrina l was short on help.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.339
I put the word out.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.720
I found a group of Mexican guys
up in Mississippi

12:49.811 --> 12:50.846
who were willing and able,

12:50.938 --> 12:53.600
brought them down here on a bus,
and they worked out fine.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.523
And, yeah, their Social Security cards
didn't match their names,

12:56.610 --> 12:58.521
but those guys saved my ass.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.145
No illegals. No exceptions.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.114
This is just one of a group of restaurants.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.613
There's more at stake here
than just your place.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.443
The immigration police come around now
a lot more often

13:08.538 --> 13:10.244
than they did just after Katrina,

13:10.332 --> 13:13.415
and we can't afford to get tangled up in that.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.208
I get it. I do.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.928
City Park ain't too far from here.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.514
-Streetcar's on Carrollton.
-LaDONNA: Starting up again in May.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.466
-Streetcar?
-Yeah.

13:32.646 --> 13:36.389
You can ride that downtown
anytime you feel an itch.

13:37.234 --> 13:41.352
Um, the streetcar was okay
a couple of years ago, but now I don't know.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.982
What you mean?

13:43.073 --> 13:45.564
Well, I'm gonna be getting a car-car
soon enough, right?

13:49.746 --> 13:51.122
Just sayin'.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.537
You're gonna be getting an ass-whooping
pretty soon,

13:55.627 --> 13:58.585
you don't catch up to that attitude of yours.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.582
Just sayin'.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.169
Let's move on, then,
to the issue of termination.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.754
How do we terminate?

14:08.849 --> 14:11.682
Let's say we're unhappy
with an employee's performance.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.975
Well, we need to communicate that
with the employee.

14:14.104 --> 14:17.847
We need to let them know and, of course,
keep a record of that communication.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.023
What it's about,
the way they're doing theirjob

14:20.110 --> 14:22.567
that we, you, are displeased with.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.857
First, you give them a verbal caution.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.321
The second time,
it becomes a written warning.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.024
And then, finally, the formal termination.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.404
And there's a form, of course,
that you'll fill out.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.702
Okay, so if somebody's giving me lip,

14:32.789 --> 14:36.156
if somebody's talking shit,
I'm getting back talk

14:36.251 --> 14:39.209
or I don't like somebody's attitude,
I can'tjust say, "Hit the bricks"?

14:39.296 --> 14:41.628
Well, it is your kitchen, Chef,

14:41.798 --> 14:44.881
but the Tim Feeny Restaurant Group
will be responsible for your decision

14:44.968 --> 14:47.334
should that employee seek legal redress.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.216
So, generally,
I would advise against summary dismissals.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.215
Now then, in your packets
you'll find the two forms

14:53.310 --> 14:54.720
that we use for written notifications.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.931
Same problem as last time.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.763
DAVIS: Which is?

15:00.192 --> 15:02.774
Davis, darling, these are all wonderful people

15:02.861 --> 15:06.820
you have on these songs,
but outside of New Orleans...

15:07.032 --> 15:08.818
What? Robert Parker?

15:09.201 --> 15:11.112
"Barefootin'"? Frogman?

15:11.203 --> 15:13.615
All these guys had careers that went national.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.411
But we need more presence,

15:15.499 --> 15:18.957
something that'll take distribution
to the next level.

15:19.669 --> 15:22.331
What Mannie Fresh did
for the hip-hop sampler.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.294
Dare to dream, Davis.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.219
Dare to dream.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.009
Which brings me to another topic,
sexual harassment.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.423
As a woman, Chef,
surely you know what it can be like

15:35.519 --> 15:37.009
for a female in the workplace.

15:37.229 --> 15:41.268
We want to be very careful and watchful
about our behaviors and our language.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.849
We need to communicate
what is acceptable and not acceptable

15:43.944 --> 15:45.559
in the way that we speak to one another.

15:45.654 --> 15:50.819
Okay, having reached the two-hour mark
on the Feeny Group policies and practices,

15:51.368 --> 15:52.448
I gotta go off.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.072
I mean, I got real work I gotta do.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.151
Chef...

15:55.247 --> 16:00.037
Listen, this is the restaurant business,
and the women who work in it are tough.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.789
If some guy's an asshole, they'll let him know.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.541
And if he doesn't wise up, he's gone.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.293
This shit's just common sense.

16:07.551 --> 16:08.791
Be that as it may,

16:08.885 --> 16:11.592
our attorneys require us
to inform employees and supervisors

16:11.680 --> 16:13.216
of our written policy.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.762
So, to that end...

16:15.392 --> 16:18.259
"It is and has been
the Tim Feeny Restaurant Group's policy

16:18.353 --> 16:19.809
"to provide a working environment

16:19.896 --> 16:22.558
"free from discrimination and/or harassment
of any kind."

16:27.904 --> 16:30.281
You think you can make this work?

16:32.242 --> 16:33.402
Larry?

16:34.744 --> 16:38.157
Baby, I gave up half my practice
when we went to Baton Rouge.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.164
l rebuilt it there. I can do it here, too.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.658
No problem.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.785
You sure?

16:44.963 --> 16:47.625
People down here still got teeth
they gotta tend to, right?

16:47.716 --> 16:50.583
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)
-Thank you for all this, baby.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.717
Ain't no thing.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.336
(LAUGHS)

16:56.057 --> 16:57.638
(CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

17:03.815 --> 17:07.103
Hey, Sonny,
you gonna help with the equipment?

17:10.405 --> 17:12.737
Come on, get your ass over here.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.776
Hey, bro, we only got an hour.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.782
Your shit ain't gonna set itself up.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.286
Lightnin' ain't gonna wait on you.

17:28.048 --> 17:31.256
(FLAMMES D'ENFER PLAYING ON RADIO)

17:32.802 --> 17:34.633
All right, to get in the mood for today's show,

17:34.721 --> 17:39.010
that was Michael Doucet and BeauSoleil's
version of "Flammes D'Enfer."

17:39.601 --> 17:43.093
Before that, the Balfa Brothers giving us
"La Valse du Port Arthur."

17:43.188 --> 17:47.147
And before that, the great Amédé Ardoin

17:47.651 --> 17:50.609
playing accordion on "Valse de Opelousas."

17:50.695 --> 17:53.402
Yeah, man,
that's taking it all the way back for us.

17:53.490 --> 17:56.732
You know, Amédé and Dennis McGee,
right there at the beginning.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.987
Yeah, so you guys are
right out of that tradition, huh?

17:59.162 --> 18:00.868
I mean, some drums, some amps,

18:00.956 --> 18:04.289
but all of it's still in that
Louisiana prairie pocket, huh?

18:04.376 --> 18:06.332
Yeah, with a little bit of New Orleans
creeping in there,

18:06.419 --> 18:07.875
thanks to Annie T.

18:07.963 --> 18:10.875
Yes, the sweetheart of Frenchmen Street,

18:11.591 --> 18:12.831
Annie Talarico.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.501
So pleased to have you back
on the show again, Annie.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.584
Thank you, Davis.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.671
Good of you to drop by
whenever you're back in town.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.930
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

18:21.184 --> 18:24.893
So let me ask you
if the rumors about you are true.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.386
(MOUTHS)

18:28.525 --> 18:29.514
Davis...

18:29.609 --> 18:31.019
No, not those rumors.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.898
I'm speaking to the talk on the street
about your recording contract.

18:33.989 --> 18:36.321
Oh, yeah. Lost Highway Records.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.692
Yeah, we're supposed to be
going into the studio this spring.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.775
A-ha.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.656
Is there any chance

18:42.747 --> 18:45.864
that we might give our listeners
a preview of that recording?

18:46.167 --> 18:49.751
Well, this is one of Linzay's songs
that I think ought to be on the release.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.337
Well, that's kind of you to say, Annie.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.208
(PLAYING MORNING BLUES)

19:03.685 --> 19:05.641
That's the third time
you've given your show over to these guys.

19:05.729 --> 19:06.718
I know. They're great.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.731
This point is, Davis, that it's bad enough

19:08.815 --> 19:11.477
you shilling for your heritage tours
and your opera-in-progress,

19:11.568 --> 19:13.559
but she, she's your girlfriend.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.441
I know, I can't believe it either. It's like...

19:17.574 --> 19:18.939
Davis, this is nepotistic.

19:19.034 --> 19:22.322
No, Darnell.
If she sucked, it would be nepotistic.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.111
But they're great, she's great, so it's cool.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.742
Cut it short.
Do something else with your last two hours.

19:27.459 --> 19:30.917
-Something else?
-Yeah, something else, man. Anything.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.747
-I quit.
-What?

19:35.175 --> 19:36.460
-I quit.
-(SCOFFS)

19:36.551 --> 19:40.089
Yeah, fill the last two hours
with whatever your heart desires.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.553
First of all, you never quit.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.551
l fire you, Davis. That's how we do.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.510
Look at us, Darnell,
we're learning, we're growing.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.682
-Davis...
-No, no, it's cool. It's cool.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.856
Look, I got a lot on my plate right now,

19:52.942 --> 19:54.443
what with the opera coming together.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.984
And I'll take some time, you'll take some time,

19:57.072 --> 20:00.155
and we'll get back to missing each other,
okay?

20:00.492 --> 20:01.777
It's cool. It really is.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.457
(SNORTING)

20:19.636 --> 20:22.002
Can you throw in that bottle of whiskey, too?

20:22.097 --> 20:23.132
Fuck you.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.995
After all the years

20:56.506 --> 20:59.339
Is it far or near?

21:02.554 --> 21:05.216
Lord, I wish you were here...

21:08.685 --> 21:10.221
Bobby, come on.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.889
Remember who you're talking to.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.807
Sure, I got connections down here,
but this thing is fixed from Washington.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.519
lt's HUD money
and it's HUD that's calling the tune.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.776
Six-term state legislator

21:25.118 --> 21:27.359
from Sugar Land, south of Houston.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.161
How this guy didn't get indicted
along with DeLay, I'll never know.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.365
Yeah, brother.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.826
That's what I'm talking about.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.421
I mean, they even got black people voting

21:37.505 --> 21:39.370
to knock down all the public housing
down here.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.707
It's a fucking feeding frenzy.

21:42.594 --> 21:43.709
Okay.

21:44.554 --> 21:47.762
Yeah, I'm good with Alphonso.
I'm good with all those guys.

21:47.849 --> 21:50.465
Ijust gotta get in the door, is all.

21:51.603 --> 21:52.888
Thanks, Bobby.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.601
Alphonso Jackson.
That name mean anything to you, brother?

21:59.694 --> 22:01.104
Can't happen. I'm sorry.

22:01.196 --> 22:02.811
But where she at now, Elie?

22:02.906 --> 22:04.897
We don't have enough
special needs resources for her.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.568
And I've got a waiting list so long

22:06.659 --> 22:09.867
that I'm gonna disappoint half the families
on it next fall.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.991
Have you considered a private?
Maybe something with special programming?

22:13.082 --> 22:14.947
Her family don't have that kind of money,
no way.

22:16.377 --> 22:19.244
-I thought since she was a special case...
-l'm sorry.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.459
Maybe another charter,
but we are over capacity here.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.507
-Told you.
-Yeah, you did.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.214
The charters ain't taking
no special needs kids if they can help it.

22:31.309 --> 22:34.016
Brings down their test scores,
which is what we sell ourselves with.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.354
So she gets nothing.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.850
School system is sunk.
Even before the storm it was sunk.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.431
Now there just ain't enough lifeboats.

22:39.526 --> 22:43.189
Shit is supposed to be
women and children first, ain't it?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.954
MAN: Where's the decaf? This is all regular.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.783
-Thanks.
-You got it.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.866
-Grease trap backed up.
-I told you, we have people for that, Chef.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.041
You just pick up the phone,

22:59.128 --> 23:01.790
I'll have somebody come over right away
and make sure it doesn't happen again.

23:02.757 --> 23:05.294
There's somebody I want you to meet.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.046
Janette Desautel, this is Emily Chang.

23:08.137 --> 23:11.049
She's a very accomplished publicist
we brought on for this project.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.926
Publicist?

23:13.059 --> 23:15.721
I can't tell you how excited I am
to be working this account.

23:15.812 --> 23:16.801
Big fan.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.888
Opening like this,
we intend to make the most of it.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.144
It's a big investment. Needs a big splash.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.068
A place this size
has to be a destination restaurant.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.940
People will make the decision
whether or not to eat here

23:27.031 --> 23:28.862
long before they leave Dubuque or New York.

23:29.284 --> 23:30.615
We need to help them make that decision.

23:30.702 --> 23:33.034
We want to be loved in New Orleans
first and foremost.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.240
Nobody's saying
we're not gonna have a loyal local crowd,

23:35.331 --> 23:36.446
but look around.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.748
This is not gonna survive
on just a walk-in trade.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.245
And that means media.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.372
And there's a nice narrative to this.

23:42.463 --> 23:43.919
The flood cost you your restaurant.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.963
You leave New Orleans, you go to New York,

23:46.050 --> 23:49.008
Le Bernardin, Lucky Peach, all that,
you come back better than ever...

23:49.095 --> 23:50.756
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let's not overstate...

23:50.847 --> 23:53.964
l have a contact at "The Today Show,"
who just loves New Orleans,

23:54.058 --> 23:55.889
and I think we have a good shot at a segment.

23:56.352 --> 23:57.683
"The Today Show"?

23:58.855 --> 24:00.265
But, wait,
what does the flood have to do with this?

24:00.356 --> 24:01.391
No, we won't exploit the flood.

24:01.482 --> 24:05.270
All I meant was there is
a reservoir of goodwill towards New Orleans.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.694
-Look, Ms...
-Chang. But call me Emily.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.778
Emily, there were people
who stayed during the storm

24:12.869 --> 24:14.450
and all that time after it.

24:14.537 --> 24:15.822
I didn't stay. I don't think we need...

24:15.913 --> 24:18.905
It's the last thing
any sensible person wants to do.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.540
Talk about their damn self on TV.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.789
lt's distasteful and, yeah, it's bullshit,

24:23.880 --> 24:25.871
but we need asses in the seats.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.923
And to get there, we have to decide
what the story of this restaurant is,

24:29.010 --> 24:31.752
what your story is,
before somebody else does.

24:32.055 --> 24:35.798
So it's either gonna be you telling your story
to Regis fucking Philbin or whoever,

24:35.892 --> 24:38.634
or it's gonna be some asshole on the Internet.

24:38.728 --> 24:41.891
We need to get in front.
That's what Emily's for.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.389
Have you had any media training?

24:47.320 --> 24:48.309
(PHONE RlNGlNG)

24:48.404 --> 24:49.564
Hello?

24:50.156 --> 24:51.896
Yes. Who's calling?

24:53.159 --> 24:56.651
Dr. Whaley from Virginia... Richmond, right!

24:57.080 --> 24:58.786
Thank you for calling me back.

24:59.123 --> 25:02.957
As I indicated,
I'm looking at deaths in the wake of Katrina.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.420
That's right, I came across this case,

25:08.508 --> 25:11.215
where this fellow was shot and then burnt up.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.963
In a car, yes.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.587
Glover, right.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.516
Oh, shit!

25:17.809 --> 25:19.925
No, no, no. Not you. Sorry.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.459
Not local, out of town.

25:47.797 --> 25:51.506
Some kid from Oakland here,
working for something called "ProPublica."

25:51.592 --> 25:54.959
-The fuck is that?
-Some online shit, not-for-profit.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.554
Anyway, he's been calling
every out-of-state pathologist

25:58.641 --> 26:00.757
who worked down here at DMORT
after the storm.

26:00.852 --> 26:03.264
-Going around Minyard, huh?
-Yeah.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.806
I got a call from a cutter I know in Dallas.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.770
Says the guy is especially interested in

something to do with
a burnt body on the Westbank.

Terry.

26:21.205 --> 26:23.321
-You holding out?
-There are no homicide files.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.997
Nothing but a missing persons report.

26:25.752 --> 26:29.870
No investigation,
no detectives assigned, nothing.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.169
-The family never called it in?
-No, they did.

26:33.551 --> 26:36.588
-Well, who talked to them?
-A detective named Bidwell.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.546
Told them he didn't know anything about it.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.505

you're gonna meet the man anyway.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.894
Come on, man, get your shit together.

40:52.284 --> 40:53.273
(DOOR CLOSES)

40:58.957 --> 41:00.242
(SlGHlNG)

41:00.751 --> 41:04.664
Then I raised objections, of course,
but it was Dr. Minyard's call.

41:04.755 --> 41:06.211
But you were there

41:06.298 --> 41:09.005
when the Orleans Parish people
did the postmortem.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.375
No. We were in Louisiana after the storm

41:11.470 --> 41:15.304
to provide support and assistance
to local authority

41:15.390 --> 41:16.641
and we did do our own autopsies,

41:16.725 --> 41:20.468
but whenever there was a suspicious death,
anything that looked like a homicide,

41:20.562 --> 41:22.177
we turned that over to the locals.

41:23.231 --> 41:26.439
And in my mind, I strongly suspected
that Glover was a homicide.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.145
Why is that?

41:28.236 --> 41:31.478
For one, there were metal fragments
in the charred remains

41:31.573 --> 41:34.315
suggestive of shattered projectiles.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.910
Of course,
I could never be completely definitive

41:35.994 --> 41:39.828
given the condition of the body
and the fact that the skull itself was missing.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.080
You never saw the skull?

41:48.924 --> 41:51.791
-Where'd you get this?
-A reliable source.

41:55.597 --> 41:59.431
This skull never made it to DMORT.
I had no skull at autopsy.

42:00.310 --> 42:02.301
The hole could be thermal from the fire,

42:03.522 --> 42:06.138
but it can also be indicative
of a gunshot wound.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.932
A close-range coup de grace, in fact.

42:10.779 --> 42:12.565
But you can't be sure?

42:13.407 --> 42:16.149
Not without an examination of the remains,
but...

42:18.161 --> 42:21.449
witnesses saw the victim fall
from a gunshot wound.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.250
That he was driven to a police checkpoint
still alive,

42:24.334 --> 42:27.326
and that the witnesses then saw
the police drive the vehicle away

42:27.421 --> 42:28.501
with the victim in the rear seat.

42:28.588 --> 42:32.297
And, above all, the location of the vehicle,
behind the levee, in the weeds.

42:32.384 --> 42:34.249
With this level of charring...

42:34.344 --> 42:37.882
I've seen lots and lots of car fires,
accidentals,

42:38.306 --> 42:39.807
but this...

42:41.101 --> 42:44.969
This is a postmortem arson

42:45.647 --> 42:48.229
with an accelerant having been used.

42:49.735 --> 42:53.102
A trained pathologist should
consider this a probable homicide,

42:53.196 --> 42:56.859
and he would be telling police
to begin a full-bore investigation.

42:57.159 --> 42:58.695
Will you say that on record?

42:58.785 --> 43:00.821
I said it then, I'll say it now.

43:00.912 --> 43:04.404
Dr. Whaley, was this the only case at DMORT

43:04.499 --> 43:06.455
where you had a difference of opinion

43:06.543 --> 43:08.579
with the Orleans Parish officials?

43:08.670 --> 43:10.501
No indeed. No.

43:11.381 --> 43:15.715
There seemed to be a consistent pattern
of rendering "undetermined" rulings

43:15.802 --> 43:18.418
in cases where
evidence of violence was apparent.

43:18.513 --> 43:19.468
| see.

43:19.556 --> 43:22.389
And did you have occasion to become familiar

43:22.476 --> 43:25.013
with the case of a Joseph Abreu?

43:25.353 --> 43:28.265
White male, 20s, gunshot wound to the head?

43:28.857 --> 43:30.472
That name isn't familiar.

43:30.692 --> 43:31.807
Will you take a look at his, too?

43:31.902 --> 43:34.609
This is another one
that was ruled "undetermined"

43:34.696 --> 43:36.687
by Dr. Minyard's office.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.828
and then breaded and fried to order.

44:27.916 --> 44:31.033
Basically, it's like a dressed-up version
of fried chicken.

44:31.127 --> 44:34.369
The loin is lightly stuffed
with grilled escarole.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.162
It's very delicate.

44:36.258 --> 44:38.840
The loin should be pink in the middle
and cooked through.

Oh, man.

There's a time to cook, there's a time to sell.

Now, we're not gonna be able to open
before Mardi Gras,

but we still gotta keep the wheels greased.

45:17.757 --> 45:20.009
All right, take it home for me, I guess.

45:20.135 --> 45:23.673
And the pork again.
The plating on that still needs work.

45:25.515 --> 45:28.848
As you can see,
this stuff has kind of taken over my kitchen.

45:28.935 --> 45:31.221
So which block of DeSlonde
was your house again?

45:31.313 --> 45:32.723
2800.

45:32.814 --> 45:35.146
You know the Joshua family over on Forstall?

45:35.317 --> 45:39.981
They've put $5,000 into fixing their house
after it was cited as a derelict property.

45:40.155 --> 45:42.692
Even after they complied
and spent the money, city tore it down.

45:42.782 --> 45:44.318
That's only a few blocks from you.

45:44.576 --> 45:47.784
Anyway, you got burned by
something called the "imminent health risk"

45:47.871 --> 45:51.363

took all this FEMA money

45:51.458 --> 45:54.495
and put houses on that list,
whether they needed to be tore down or not.

or insurance checks.

45:58.048 --> 45:59.288

45:59.382 --> 46:02.590
Well, since the storm, a lot of money's been
made just tearing stuff down.

46:03.178 --> 46:05.669
We're seeing some pattern
to where the demolitions are.

46:05.805 --> 46:09.263
ln Mid-City,
it might be part of another land grab.

46:09.351 --> 46:10.932
Actually getting people home,

46:11.019 --> 46:14.807
I guess no one's figured out
how to turn a quick buck on that.

46:14.898 --> 46:18.015
We posted ldaBelle Joshua's
story on our website.

46:18.109 --> 46:20.725
-You might wanna look at that.
-What do you mean, "posted"?

called "Squandered Heritage."

Demolishing houses
with people still fighting to come home?

you in your house and all here uptown.

46:36.044 --> 46:38.581

before the meeting was supposed to start.

46:54.562 --> 46:57.725
Stopped people from attending,
stopped people from testifying.

46:57.941 --> 46:59.602
Everyone I talk to says something different.

46:59.693 --> 47:02.685
I mean, there's gotta be some rules
or laws as to how they do...

47:02.779 --> 47:04.519
Katrina took away whatever rules there were.

47:04.614 --> 47:07.777
Now it's just them and what they wanna do.

47:07.867 --> 47:09.027
And us.

47:11.579 --> 47:13.160
So you're going to Washington.

47:13.248 --> 47:14.704
That's where the money is.

47:15.250 --> 47:18.913
Willie Sutton. He was a bank robber, famous.

Some reporter once asked him
why he robbed banks.

47:22.257 --> 47:23.747
"That's where the money is."

I'll saddle up and ride to the next opportunity.

you had before, the one with the Hyatt.

47:49.617 --> 47:51.278
-It is different.
-What happened?

47:51.703 --> 47:53.443
Politics.

47:53.538 --> 47:56.530
Wynton Marsalis endorsed
Landrieu over Nagin,

47:56.624 --> 48:00.333
so Nagin cooled on Irvin Mayfield
that was fronting the Hyatt project,

48:00.420 --> 48:03.253
and who came in with Wynton
when we were pitching the idea to the mayor.

48:03.631 --> 48:05.007
So they fucked themselves?

48:05.258 --> 48:06.794
They did.

48:06.926 --> 48:09.258
Ever since the election,
the Hyatt people, Irvin,

48:09.345 --> 48:13.463
no one who had anything to do with
the project could get Ray Nagin on the phone.

48:13.558 --> 48:14.638
Payback is hell.

48:16.102 --> 48:17.638
So this new thing here?

We're going with some new developers
who are closer to the mayor's heart,

48:27.322 --> 48:29.483
maybe stepping sideways away from Irvin.

52:55.590 --> 52:57.376
The new Ninth Ward

52:57.550 --> 52:59.211
New Ninth Ward

52:59.635 --> 53:01.250
The new Ninth Ward

53:01.763 --> 53:03.344
(PANTING, MOANING)

53:20.156 --> 53:21.692
Shit. Fuck.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.202
(CONDOM SNAPS)

53:28.331 --> 53:31.164
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
-(MEN CHANTING, SHOUTING)

54:03.324 --> 54:05.986
(MUSIC BLARING)

54:27.014 --> 54:28.754
You having fun?

54:28.891 --> 54:31.143
-A lot of energy.
-I'm surprised you wanted to come.

54:31.227 --> 54:33.388
Thought you'd be out with your fellow,
one of his gigs.

54:33.521 --> 54:35.978
-He kind of pissed me off.
-How'd he do that?

54:36.107 --> 54:39.691
Sometimes he can be kind of immature.

54:40.194 --> 54:41.445
Immature, huh?

54:43.364 --> 54:44.353
(CROWD CHEERING)

54:45.366 --> 54:47.231
I'll be right back.

(SINGING)

55:15.563 --> 55:16.552
Whoo!

55:18.733 --> 55:20.689
Everybody pay their tab?

55:20.776 --> 55:22.516
Always.

55:23.446 --> 55:25.311
Hear that.

55:27.992 --> 55:29.528
I've been meaning to ask you something.

55:29.619 --> 55:31.405
Mm-hmm.

55:31.746 --> 55:35.034
What does "two way, pocky way" mean?
I mean, for real.

55:35.374 --> 55:37.865
-For real?
-Yeah. Yeah, for real.

55:39.462 --> 55:40.622
I can't tell you that.

55:42.298 --> 55:44.289
'Cause I'm a woman.

55:45.259 --> 55:46.590
(LAUGHS)

55:48.429 --> 55:50.966
(SIGHS)
You are all woman.

55:51.140 --> 55:52.380
(CHUCKLES)

55:54.268 --> 55:55.769
But you ain't Indian.

55:57.605 --> 56:00.438
So if I wanted to know
the secret handshake or something,

56:01.776 --> 56:04.609
what you're saying is
there's just no hope for me, huh?

56:05.738 --> 56:08.946
Baby, there's always hope.

56:10.785 --> 56:12.491
(LAUGHS)

56:23.130 --> 56:24.631
(KNOCKING)

56:36.227 --> 56:37.592
Are you crazy, Sonny?

56:37.687 --> 56:40.303
You can't see Linh, not now.

56:40.439 --> 56:41.474
I need to see you.

56:42.358 --> 56:43.564
Please?

56:59.083 --> 57:00.823
Go. Go.

57:13.598 --> 57:15.338
I'm so sorry.

57:16.684 --> 57:18.845
I love Linh so much.

57:20.313 --> 57:23.646
Ijust... I don't know what happened.
I could...

57:23.733 --> 57:25.724
Please forgive me.
