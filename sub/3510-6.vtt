00:25.259 --> 00:27.470
Living room, 9:03 P.M.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.659
EMF level spiking off the chart.

00:36.838 --> 00:37.905
Hello?

00:38.873 --> 00:40.324
Is anyone there?

00:42.758 --> 00:44.056
Mercy...

00:45.101 --> 00:46.618
I can see it.

00:47.641 --> 00:48.829
Mercy...

00:50.665 --> 00:51.875
No!

00:51.925 --> 00:53.057
No!

00:57.230 --> 00:59.199
Dad, are you using me as a shield

00:59.249 --> 01:01.244
- against flesh-eating zombies?
- No.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.466
No. I just wanted you
to have a better view.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.671
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going? I think--

01:06.721 --> 01:08.067
I really think we're
safer in pairs.

01:08.117 --> 01:09.853
Sorry, dad. You're gonna
have to fend for yourself.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.199
I'm skyping with Ashley.

01:11.249 --> 01:12.114
What?

01:12.164 --> 01:14.102
Right in the middle of
father-daughter zombie time?

01:14.152 --> 01:14.885
Can't you do it later?

01:14.935 --> 01:15.994
He's not available later.

01:16.044 --> 01:18.703
He's got a dorm meeting and
then a seminar after that.

01:18.753 --> 01:19.953
I know he's busy,

01:20.445 --> 01:21.711
and you are very thoughtful

01:21.761 --> 01:23.155
to be so accommodating,
sweetheart,

01:23.205 --> 01:27.017
but a healthy relationship
is based on mutual respect.

01:27.067 --> 01:28.979
I mean, think about what kind
of signal you're sending

01:29.029 --> 01:32.146
if you're the one always
rearranging your schedule

01:32.196 --> 01:34.003
at the other one's
every beck and call.

01:34.053 --> 01:36.167
I mean, if you just
drop everything...

01:36.217 --> 01:39.061
the very moment that--
I'm sorry.

01:39.616 --> 01:40.715
Oh, hang on.

01:41.657 --> 01:42.875
Detective Beckett.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.163
I'll be right there.

01:47.037 --> 01:48.328
I'm worried about Alexis.

01:48.378 --> 01:49.674
I think her not
getting into Stanford

01:49.724 --> 01:52.850
has upset the balance of power
in her relationship with Ashley.

01:52.912 --> 01:55.301
Oh, Castle, I wouldn't
worry about that.

01:55.351 --> 01:59.043
I mean, Alexis is a girl,
and Ashley's a teenage boy.

01:59.093 --> 02:01.565
I'd say she still holds
most of the power.

02:02.225 --> 02:03.670
The "Ghost Wranglers" are here?

02:04.819 --> 02:06.981
Okay, that's why I
love these guys.

02:07.031 --> 02:08.049
Body's not even cold,

02:08.098 --> 02:09.526
they're already tracking
down the ghost.

02:09.577 --> 02:11.595
Why doesn't it surprise me
that you actually watch

02:11.645 --> 02:13.277
that ridiculous show?

02:13.327 --> 02:14.858
Ridiculously awesome.

02:14.908 --> 02:17.276
Jack Sinclair is hands down

02:17.326 --> 02:20.520
America's most
accomplished ghost hunter.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.612
Um, Castle...

02:23.483 --> 02:25.483
Jack Sinclair is the
name of our victim.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.545
And the hunter
becomes the hunted.

02:29.844 --> 02:31.700
He was here doing a
special about the house,

02:31.750 --> 02:33.108
you know, for his TV show.

02:33.158 --> 02:34.216
Why this place?

02:34.266 --> 02:35.720
It has a bit of a history.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.255
You mean, paranormal history?

02:37.305 --> 02:38.705
Look, detective, I'm not saying

02:38.755 --> 02:40.540
I believe in that stuff, okay?

02:40.590 --> 02:42.267
But I've owned the McClaren house

02:42.317 --> 02:43.639
for over 20 years,

02:43.689 --> 02:45.502
and when the phone rings
about this place,

02:45.552 --> 02:47.472
odds are, it's not
a busted toilet.

02:47.522 --> 02:48.829
Anybody live in there now?

02:48.879 --> 02:49.814
Not for years.

02:49.864 --> 02:51.961
It's hard getting tenants
to stick around.

02:52.011 --> 02:53.752
So when this Sinclair guy called,

02:53.802 --> 02:54.999
I figured, what the hell?

02:55.049 --> 02:56.494
Maybe he could clear
the place up,

02:56.544 --> 02:57.807
make it rentable.

02:57.857 --> 02:59.662
But after what just happened...

03:00.269 --> 03:01.894
Wh-what exactly did just happen?

03:01.944 --> 03:05.002
His throat was slit
almost from ear to ear.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.814
Jugular, superior thyroid,

03:06.864 --> 03:08.475
common carotid, left and right--

03:08.525 --> 03:09.964
you name it, it's been severed.

03:10.014 --> 03:11.406
Well, that explains
all the blood.

03:11.456 --> 03:13.544
Here's what I can't explain--

03:13.594 --> 03:15.502
depth and nature of
the wounds tell me

03:15.552 --> 03:17.577
that the killer got up
close and personal.

03:17.627 --> 03:18.828
So then where are the footprints?

03:18.878 --> 03:21.467
Not just that.
Look at the blood spatter.

03:21.517 --> 03:23.349
You cut all those arteries,

03:23.399 --> 03:24.961
and the spray is gonna come fast

03:25.011 --> 03:26.368
and it's gonna come strong.

03:26.418 --> 03:27.679
I'll say. It went everywhere.

03:27.729 --> 03:28.629
But it shouldn't have.

03:28.679 --> 03:30.497
Some of it should've
landed on the killer.

03:31.832 --> 03:34.348
Yet every drop of it
landed on the floor.

03:34.398 --> 03:36.723
This spray is completely
unobstructed.

03:36.773 --> 03:37.472
Exactly.

03:37.522 --> 03:38.878
It doesn't make sense.

03:38.928 --> 03:42.961
Unless the blood passed
right through the killer.

03:43.884 --> 03:46.007
Are you saying a ghost did this?

03:46.057 --> 03:46.981
Please don't encourage him.

03:47.031 --> 03:47.982
I'm saying,

03:48.056 --> 03:50.229
maybe Mr. Sinclair
finally met a wraith

03:50.279 --> 03:51.496
he couldn't wrangle.

03:52.737 --> 03:54.197
Lanie, who called this in?

03:54.247 --> 03:56.643
I'm... Jack's producer.

03:56.693 --> 03:58.244
I worked with him for
the last four years.

03:58.297 --> 03:59.696
Okay, Lulu, we just need to know

03:59.746 --> 04:02.326
everything that happened
before you called 9-1-1.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.118
Okay.

04:03.168 --> 04:05.616
Jack went in the house
at around 7:00.

04:05.666 --> 04:08.561
And then he went on lockdown
a few minutes after that.

04:08.611 --> 04:10.928
Uh, he locks himself into
the house for the night.

04:10.978 --> 04:12.465
It's standard protocol
for ghost hunters.

04:12.515 --> 04:14.464
Uh-huh. And was he in there alone?
Yeah.

04:14.514 --> 04:16.873
We always do a clean
sweep of the place

04:16.923 --> 04:17.973
right before we start.

04:18.023 --> 04:20.119
So he--he locked the
doors, and then

04:20.168 --> 04:22.407
I went into the tech
van to watch the feed.

04:22.457 --> 04:24.386
And were the cameras
rolling the whole time?

04:26.260 --> 04:27.992
The infrared cameras
are to detect

04:28.042 --> 04:30.174
unexplained thermal anomalies.

04:30.224 --> 04:30.988
Living room,

04:31.038 --> 04:32.457
9:03 P.M.

04:32.791 --> 04:35.202
EMF levels spiking
off the charts.

04:35.237 --> 04:37.599
That's an electromagnetic
field meter.

04:37.649 --> 04:39.217
That's a tool of the
ghost busting trade.

04:39.267 --> 04:41.681
It's used to measure spikes
in paranormal energy.

04:42.622 --> 04:44.091
Let's just watch.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.842
Hello?

04:50.302 --> 04:51.402
Anyone there?

04:55.203 --> 04:56.531
Mercy...

04:57.059 --> 04:58.431
I can see it.

04:59.672 --> 05:00.860
Mercy...

05:00.910 --> 05:03.948
It sounds like he was begging
his killer for mercy.

05:05.065 --> 05:06.041
What happened?

05:06.091 --> 05:07.247
That--that's it.

05:07.297 --> 05:09.209
That's when all the camera
signals cut out at once.

05:09.259 --> 05:10.440
And what could
explain the picture

05:10.490 --> 05:11.628
suddenly going out like that?

05:11.678 --> 05:13.819
I don't know.
It's never happened before.

05:13.869 --> 05:16.141
Well, there was that last
episode of "The Sopranos."

05:16.191 --> 05:17.335
No, there's no way.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.731
Jack had to have been in
there with someone else.

05:20.094 --> 05:21.167
Did he have any enemies,

05:21.217 --> 05:23.648
anybody that he was having
problems with recently?

05:23.698 --> 05:25.166
No, not that I know of.

05:25.216 --> 05:28.386
He... he did show up
to lockdown upset.

05:28.436 --> 05:30.376
Do you know where he
was coming from? No.

05:30.426 --> 05:32.658
He pulled up in a cab
and grabbed his gear

05:32.708 --> 05:33.846
and just went inside.

05:33.896 --> 05:35.789
Did anyone else have
keys to this place?

05:35.839 --> 05:37.328
Just Jack and Barry B.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.281
Barry Bavetta.
That's Jack's cameraman.

05:40.038 --> 05:41.094
Where is Barry?

05:41.144 --> 05:42.791
Doesn't he usually do
lockdown with Jack?

05:42.841 --> 05:44.604
He and Jack had an
argument this afternoon.

05:44.654 --> 05:47.164
Things got pretty heated,
and then Barry just quit.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.714
Could he have
programmed the cameras

05:48.764 --> 05:49.876
to turn off like that?

05:50.404 --> 05:52.735
Actually... yeah, he could.

05:54.873 --> 05:57.635
Barry Bavetta checked out of
his hotel in a hurry at 7:30.

05:57.685 --> 05:59.369
Mm. That's enough time to
make it back to the house

05:59.419 --> 06:01.225
by 9:00 when Jack was killed.

06:01.275 --> 06:03.167
Barry's phone is still going
straight to voice mail.

06:03.217 --> 06:05.331
Well, the manager gave
me his credit card info,

06:05.381 --> 06:07.000
so if we're lucky he's
out there using it.

06:07.050 --> 06:08.337
All right, I'm gonna start
scrubbing this footage

06:08.387 --> 06:09.270
from inside of the house.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.135
Maybe there's something in there
that can implicate this guy.

06:11.185 --> 06:12.710
Right. Hey.

06:12.909 --> 06:14.214
We're still on for dinner
tomorrow night, right?

06:14.264 --> 06:15.648
Oh, yeah.
Jenny's totally psyched.

06:15.698 --> 06:18.024
She's never really hung out
with Lanie before, so cool.

06:18.074 --> 06:19.183
Well, just to let you know,

06:19.233 --> 06:20.773
Lanie's gonna be getting
off a double shift,

06:20.823 --> 06:22.136
so she could be a little cranky.

06:22.186 --> 06:24.157
Oh. Maybe we should reschedule.

06:24.207 --> 06:25.424
I mean, isn't the whole point

06:25.474 --> 06:26.884
for Jenny and Lanie to get along?

06:26.934 --> 06:27.916
Nah, she'll be cool.

06:27.966 --> 06:30.811
Just, you know, don't say
anything controversial.

06:31.408 --> 06:32.728
Like what?

06:32.778 --> 06:34.769
What's controversial?

06:34.819 --> 06:35.858
Bingo.

06:35.908 --> 06:37.485
Bingo? Don't talk about Bingo?

06:38.482 --> 06:40.696
Barry Bavetta's been busy,
and so has his lap.

06:41.209 --> 06:42.097
Dude has racked up

06:42.147 --> 06:43.783
a hell of a tab at a strip club

06:43.833 --> 06:45.053
by the airport.

06:45.103 --> 06:47.191
First charge, an hour
after the murder.

06:47.851 --> 06:49.787
Sorry to interrupt
your fun, Barry.

06:49.837 --> 06:51.590
We heard you were racking
up quite a bill.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.889
Or is that billing quite a rack?

06:55.044 --> 06:57.636
So what, getting a lap
dance is illegal now?

06:57.686 --> 06:59.566
Look, I was just blowing
off some steam.

06:59.616 --> 07:00.664
Haven't had the best day.

07:00.714 --> 07:01.455
Yeah, so we heard.

07:01.517 --> 07:03.584
Your producer said that
you and Jack Sinclair

07:03.634 --> 07:04.869
had a falling out today.

07:04.922 --> 07:06.973
So this is about Jack? Yeah.

07:07.023 --> 07:08.318
We got into it.

07:08.368 --> 07:09.664
Wasn't the first
fight we ever had,

07:09.714 --> 07:11.898
but I made sure
it'll be the last.

07:13.394 --> 07:14.923
Why don't you tell us
what happened, Barry?

07:14.973 --> 07:16.612
Jack screwed me over
is what happened.

07:16.662 --> 07:17.860
He told me last-minute

07:17.910 --> 07:19.910
I wasn't going with him
on lockdown tonight.

07:20.345 --> 07:21.339
Any reason?

07:21.389 --> 07:23.364
The only one he gave
was, he's the boss.

07:23.414 --> 07:25.903
But... it's 'cause he's jealous.

07:25.953 --> 07:28.233
Worried I'm gonna walk
off with all the credit.

07:28.283 --> 07:29.040
Why is that?

07:29.090 --> 07:30.545
Because the episode
we're doing tonight,

07:30.595 --> 07:32.812
the McClaren house, was my idea.

07:32.862 --> 07:34.176
I did all the research.

07:34.226 --> 07:36.181
Jack didn't even want
to do the damn show.

07:36.231 --> 07:37.336
Why wouldn't Jack want to do

07:37.386 --> 07:38.928
a show about a haunted
mansion in New York?

07:38.978 --> 07:40.419
That sounds like ratings gold.

07:40.469 --> 07:42.143
Jack's weird about New York.

07:42.193 --> 07:43.225
He was brought up
here, but he's got

07:43.275 --> 07:45.143
some strange aversion
to coming back.

07:45.193 --> 07:46.637
He tried to torpedo
the whole thing,

07:46.687 --> 07:48.610
said he wouldn't be caught
dead in that house.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.404
And you decided to
prove him wrong?

07:51.134 --> 07:52.120
What?

07:52.170 --> 07:55.498
Jack Sinclair was killed in
the McClaren house tonight.

07:55.859 --> 07:56.730
Killed?

07:56.780 --> 07:59.510
Barry, why didn't you give
your keys back to the owner?

07:59.853 --> 08:01.309
Uh, I'm--I was--

08:01.359 --> 08:02.658
I was, uh, upset. I forgot.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.572
Is--is--is he really dead?

08:04.622 --> 08:07.365
You were the one who set
up the cameras, right?

08:07.415 --> 08:08.412
Yeah.

08:09.283 --> 08:10.004
So?

08:10.054 --> 08:11.792
So you knew exactly
where they were placed

08:11.842 --> 08:14.000
and how to avoid them when
you snuck back in the house.

08:14.050 --> 08:15.742
You even knew how to program them

08:15.792 --> 08:17.176
to turn off at a certain point.

08:17.226 --> 08:19.628
Whoa, whoa. I did not kill Jack.

08:19.678 --> 08:20.962
I wasn't even there.

08:21.012 --> 08:23.513
I got stuck in the security line
and missed my flight to LA.

08:23.563 --> 08:25.836
I went to the strip
club right after that.

08:25.886 --> 08:26.969
You can check that.

08:27.019 --> 08:28.422
So TSA has Barry

08:28.472 --> 08:31.926
going through security
at 9:15 at JFK.

08:31.976 --> 08:34.160
There's no way that
he was in the house

08:34.211 --> 08:35.972
at the time of the murder.

08:36.023 --> 08:37.812
Plus, tech checked
out those cameras.

08:37.861 --> 08:39.087
They weren't programmed
to turn off.

08:39.136 --> 08:40.914
The only thing Barry's
guilty of killing

08:40.964 --> 08:42.638
is time at that strip club.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.978
So... if Barry's not our guy,

08:45.028 --> 08:46.704
I think it's time we
revisit the possibility

08:46.754 --> 08:47.390
that our killer's a--

08:47.440 --> 08:50.242
If you say ghost, I'm
sending you home.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.551
Apparition-American.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.414
Have you figured out

08:55.464 --> 08:57.323
another way to explain
the blood spatter?

08:57.373 --> 08:59.434
No, I haven't, but I will.

08:59.484 --> 09:01.513
Apparently Jack
Sinclair was very upset

09:01.563 --> 09:03.088
when he arrived in a
taxi cab tonight,

09:03.138 --> 09:05.030
so let's find out where
that cab picked him up

09:05.080 --> 09:05.989
and what he was doing there.

09:06.039 --> 09:06.966
Roger that.

09:07.335 --> 09:08.901
You'll see, Castle.
This will turn out just like

09:08.951 --> 09:10.582
every other murder investigation.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.284
Once we find out more
about our victim's life,

09:12.334 --> 09:13.911
the details surrounding
his death,

09:13.964 --> 09:15.328
everything will be explained.

09:15.378 --> 09:16.462
Um...

09:16.858 --> 09:17.978
maybe not everything.

09:19.093 --> 09:21.169
I was reviewing the footage
shot inside the house tonight

09:21.219 --> 09:22.598
looking for signs that
someone else was there--

09:22.648 --> 09:24.310
a-a shadow, a
reflection, something.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.518
Instead, I found, uh,

09:27.020 --> 09:29.571
well, you better
see for yourself.

09:30.574 --> 09:32.090
So I slowed down the video.

09:32.201 --> 09:34.571
Watch the tripod
in the background.

09:38.074 --> 09:39.394
There. You see it.

09:44.743 --> 09:45.737
Wh--um...

09:46.819 --> 09:49.058
I'm sure there's a perfectly
simple explanation

09:49.108 --> 09:50.246
for all of that.

09:50.296 --> 09:51.609
There is.

09:53.765 --> 09:55.236
They're here.

09:56.411 --> 10:01.809

10:05.359 --> 10:07.048
Whoa. Did you get any sleep?

10:07.098 --> 10:09.666
Not a wink, but it was worth it.

10:09.716 --> 10:12.903
After researching the history
of the McClaren mansion,

10:12.953 --> 10:13.930
I think I know what happened

10:13.980 --> 10:15.681
to our victim, ghost
hunter Jack Sinclair.

10:15.731 --> 10:17.212
- That coffee's for you, by the way.
- Oh.

10:18.224 --> 10:20.031
Oh, the--the other one. That's...

10:20.604 --> 10:21.747
that's--

10:21.797 --> 10:23.093
I'll make you a--
I'll make you one.

10:23.143 --> 10:26.454
Um, since the McClaren
mansion was built

10:26.504 --> 10:28.205
in 1898,

10:28.255 --> 10:29.357
bodies have been piling up

10:29.407 --> 10:30.950
faster than a Tarantino movie.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.516
Eight killings in all,

10:32.566 --> 10:34.873
starting with the original
owner, Robert Pettigrew,

10:34.923 --> 10:36.197
strangled, 1903.

10:36.247 --> 10:37.737
All the way to Melanie Benton,

10:37.787 --> 10:39.514
hacked to pieces in 1991.

10:39.564 --> 10:41.344
The current owner, Steve Fuller,

10:41.394 --> 10:43.015
tried to have the
house torn down,

10:43.065 --> 10:45.196
but it was declared a landmark
by the society for historic--

10:45.246 --> 10:46.348
I'm sorry, Castle.

10:46.398 --> 10:48.108
I appreciate your work. I do.

10:48.158 --> 10:50.459
But what does this have
to do with our case?

10:51.264 --> 10:52.091
Just getting to that.

10:52.141 --> 10:55.434
It seems that in almost
all of these killings,

10:55.484 --> 10:58.174
the killer claimed that there
was a--ready for this?

10:58.224 --> 11:01.415
That a demon was responsible.

11:02.344 --> 11:03.650
A demon? Really?

11:03.700 --> 11:06.003
I'm not making this up.
It's in the books.

11:06.053 --> 11:08.067
Fine.
A demon killed Jack Sinclair.

11:08.117 --> 11:10.224
So what's our next step?
Are we gonna stake out the house,

11:10.274 --> 11:13.048
wait for the demon to show up,
zap him with our proton pack?

11:17.227 --> 11:18.943
That's not a real
thing, you know,

11:18.993 --> 11:20.922
that real ghost hunters use.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.271
Real ghost hunters?

11:22.321 --> 11:24.057
Isn't that a contradiction
in terms, bro?

11:24.963 --> 11:27.215
Okay. Does anyone have anything
pertinent to our case?

11:27.265 --> 11:27.914
I do.

11:27.964 --> 11:28.538
Okay.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.747
I tracked down that cab
our vic took last night.

11:30.797 --> 11:32.154
The driver's trip log says

11:32.204 --> 11:34.740
that he picked up Jack on
the corner of 38th and 9th.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.920
Have uniforms canvass the
area with Jack's photo.

11:36.970 --> 11:37.984
Let's see what he was up to.

11:38.034 --> 11:39.040
Oh, and phone records, too.

11:39.090 --> 11:40.826
Maybe that'll shed
some light on things.

11:41.292 --> 11:42.216
I think I can shed some light

11:42.266 --> 11:43.835
on why Jack didn't want
to do the show here.

11:43.885 --> 11:45.365
Talked to an old high school pal

11:45.415 --> 11:47.302
that Jack had breakfast
with a couple of days ago.

11:47.352 --> 11:49.954
Turns out that our vic
actually used to live

11:50.004 --> 11:51.455
right near the McClaren house.

11:51.505 --> 11:54.613
Said that he used to walk a
couple blocks out of his way

11:54.663 --> 11:56.047
just to avoid walking past it.

11:56.097 --> 11:58.070
Said it gave him a
creeped out feeling.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.337
You see? I am telling you,

11:59.387 --> 12:01.625
there is something going
on with this house.

12:01.675 --> 12:04.229
The last people... well, to--

12:04.279 --> 12:06.109
the last people that lived there

12:06.159 --> 12:08.232
moved out four years
ago in a hurry.

12:08.282 --> 12:09.015
Why?

12:09.065 --> 12:11.110
I don't know, but I think
it's time we found out.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.152
Knock yourself out, Castle.

12:12.202 --> 12:14.029
- You're not coming?
- No, I've got a murder to solve.

12:15.347 --> 12:16.130
I'll go.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.663
- Ooh. That's a look.
- Yeah.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.868
I get these a lot.
Just start walking.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.584
- Let's go.
- Faster.

12:34.048 --> 12:35.729
I just saw Ryan downstairs.

12:35.779 --> 12:37.576
I can't believe you let him go
chasing ghosts with Castle.

12:37.626 --> 12:40.097
Yeah. Maybe Shaggy will
keep Scooby out of trouble.

12:40.147 --> 12:41.332
Besides, you never know.

12:41.382 --> 12:42.898
Maybe they'll come up
with something useful.

12:42.948 --> 12:44.579
Oh, you want useful?

12:44.629 --> 12:46.145
Because I just spoke to CSU.

12:46.195 --> 12:47.755
They found fingerprints
at the scene

12:47.805 --> 12:49.956
from a real live person, so...

12:51.734 --> 12:54.019
His name is Ron Berger.
He lives in Queens.

12:54.069 --> 12:55.963
- They're picking him up now.
- Does he have a record?

12:56.013 --> 12:57.556
Yeah. Chuckles did eight years

12:57.608 --> 12:59.817
for armed robbery with a knife.

12:59.867 --> 13:01.637
He's also dabbled
in B&E, which makes

13:01.687 --> 13:03.621
breaking into a locked house
no problem for this guy.

13:03.671 --> 13:05.035
When did he get out of prison?

13:05.085 --> 13:05.933
Five weeks ago.

13:05.983 --> 13:08.396
Ohh, finally a lead
that makes sense.

13:08.446 --> 13:09.487
Oh, it gets better.

13:09.537 --> 13:11.062
Ron has a history with our vic.

13:11.112 --> 13:13.112
"Ghost Wranglers" did a piece
on five points correctional,

13:13.162 --> 13:14.484
and Ron was featured.

13:14.534 --> 13:16.895
Claims he was sharing
his cell with a spirit.

13:16.945 --> 13:18.338
Well, that's prison
overcrowding for you.

13:18.388 --> 13:20.818
Apparently, Casper was being
a little too friendly,

13:20.868 --> 13:22.508
touching Ron in all
the wrong places.

13:22.558 --> 13:24.065
- Molested by a ghost.
- Mm-hmm.

13:24.115 --> 13:26.079
Wow. Some people will do
anything to get on TV.

13:26.129 --> 13:27.269
Yeah, except it backfired on him.

13:27.319 --> 13:29.565
Ron became the laughingstock
of the prison yard.

13:29.615 --> 13:31.008
He got all pissed off,

13:31.058 --> 13:32.495
and he wrote the show a letter.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.555
"I'm gonna make
Jack Sinclair bleed

13:34.605 --> 13:36.121
for what he did to me."

13:36.667 --> 13:37.845
I wrote that letter, yeah.

13:37.895 --> 13:39.823
But that was as far as it went.
I-I didn't kill him.

13:39.873 --> 13:41.655
Where were you last
night at 9:00 P.M.?

13:41.705 --> 13:44.370
I was at home, watching cartoons.

13:44.420 --> 13:45.288
Hmm.

13:45.338 --> 13:46.608
You can ask my mom.

13:46.658 --> 13:48.491
Well, we have a problem,
Ron, because we found

13:48.541 --> 13:50.523
your fingerprints inside
the McClaren house.

13:50.573 --> 13:52.211
I-I-I can explain that.

13:52.952 --> 13:53.953
I'm waiting.

13:54.003 --> 13:55.932
I-I can't violate my parole.

13:55.982 --> 13:57.648
I can't go back to Five Points,

13:57.698 --> 13:59.917
not--not in that cell,
not--not with that...

14:00.639 --> 14:01.377
thing.

14:01.427 --> 14:03.480
You're worried about your ghost?

14:03.530 --> 14:04.950
Ron, you're looking at murder.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.632
You've got a flimsy alibi.

14:06.682 --> 14:08.733
Your fingerprints are all
over the crime scene.

14:08.783 --> 14:11.838
You had means, motive,
and opportunity.

14:11.888 --> 14:12.999
All right, all right.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.240
I was there.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.527
Just, uh, not last night.

14:16.577 --> 14:17.627
About a month ago.

14:17.677 --> 14:18.727
I was there because of Jack.

14:18.777 --> 14:20.214
He--he called me after I got out.

14:20.264 --> 14:21.137
Jack Sinclair called you,

14:21.187 --> 14:22.527
after you threatened him?

14:22.577 --> 14:25.140
To apologize for the
prison show thing,

14:25.190 --> 14:26.453
and he--he had a request.

14:26.503 --> 14:27.788
What kind of a request?

14:27.838 --> 14:29.363
Uh, it was a strange one.

14:29.413 --> 14:32.088
He wanted me to take pictures
inside the McClaren house.

14:33.144 --> 14:34.842
- Why you?
- It was locked up.

14:34.892 --> 14:37.252
So, uh... I had to break in.

14:37.302 --> 14:39.847
Did he give you any reason for
asking for those pictures?

14:41.035 --> 14:42.900
Okay. We're gonna need
to see the photos.

14:43.375 --> 14:44.088
Hmm.

14:44.369 --> 14:46.296
So tech analyzed the SD card.

14:46.346 --> 14:48.308
Time/date stamp was
not messed with.

14:48.358 --> 14:51.029
- So then Ron was telling the truth?
- Well, about the photos.

14:51.079 --> 14:53.660
I'm still not buying the whole
"touched by a phantom" routine.

14:53.730 --> 14:56.111
I wonder what Jack wanted
with all these photos.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.736
You know, all of the pictures
are of just one room--

14:58.786 --> 14:59.486
the living room.

14:59.536 --> 15:01.405
That's the same room
as the crime scene.

15:01.991 --> 15:03.994
So Jack hired Ron
Berger to take pictures

15:04.044 --> 15:05.859
of the very room he
was gonna die in.

15:07.953 --> 15:09.083
That's creepy.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.081
That's not creepy, Castle.

15:11.131 --> 15:12.594
I'm sure it can all be explained

15:12.644 --> 15:13.774
and I bet you that living room

15:13.824 --> 15:16.628
has absolutely nothing to
do with ghosts or demons.

15:16.898 --> 15:18.550
The living room, definitely.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.591
That was the epicenter
of the activity.

15:21.198 --> 15:23.484
Ms. Boyer, when you
say activity...

15:23.534 --> 15:24.795
We didn't buy it either.

15:24.845 --> 15:26.265
We had heard all about
the McClaren house,

15:26.315 --> 15:27.366
it's history.

15:27.416 --> 15:28.307
We laughed about it.

15:28.357 --> 15:30.402
At first, everything was fine.

15:30.452 --> 15:32.522
Then it started--
lights going off,

15:32.572 --> 15:35.601
strange noises, doors slamming.

15:36.639 --> 15:38.870
Did anything violent ever happen?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.014
One night, uh,

15:40.064 --> 15:41.571
we heard noises from
the living room,

15:41.621 --> 15:43.023
we went downstairs,

15:43.073 --> 15:44.580
found the whole room trashed.

15:44.630 --> 15:46.155
Tables flipped over,

15:46.205 --> 15:48.442
books ripped apart,
pictures smashed.

15:48.492 --> 15:51.002
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

15:51.052 --> 15:52.646
Is that when you
decided to move out?

15:52.696 --> 15:53.817
Not without a fight.

15:53.867 --> 15:55.629
We found this woman. This, um,

15:55.664 --> 15:56.770
ghost hunter.

15:56.820 --> 15:57.826
Said she was the best.

15:57.876 --> 16:01.336
Said all other ghost hunters
came to her for help.

16:01.386 --> 16:03.675
But she took one look, and
told us to run like hell.

16:03.725 --> 16:04.676
Yeah, what was her name?

16:04.726 --> 16:06.395
Um... Mercy.

16:06.445 --> 16:08.430
That's right. Mercy Lagrande.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.454
"Mercy, I can see it. Mercy."

16:11.504 --> 16:12.342
Maybe Jack Sinclair

16:12.392 --> 16:13.961
wasn't begging for
mercy when he died.

16:14.011 --> 16:15.501
He was saying her name.

16:15.551 --> 16:16.873
Mercy Lagrande,

16:16.923 --> 16:18.712
real name, Mercedes King,

16:18.762 --> 16:22.847
runs an unlicensed business
doing paranormal consultations.

16:22.897 --> 16:24.730
There's a reason why
she's unlicensed.

16:24.780 --> 16:26.261
Check out this rap sheet.

16:26.311 --> 16:29.297
We've got ID theft,
fraud, check fraud,

16:29.347 --> 16:30.819
and impersonating a
religious official.

16:30.869 --> 16:33.845
Look at where her business
is located--38th and 9th.

16:33.895 --> 16:35.886
That's on the same block
our vic caught that cab.

16:35.936 --> 16:37.285
So Jack paid Mercy a visit,

16:37.335 --> 16:39.475
and then goes to the
McClaren house upset.

16:39.525 --> 16:40.250
Hours later,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.621
he says Mercy's name
right before he dies.

16:42.671 --> 16:45.491
So the question is, how is
she involved in all of this?

16:45.541 --> 16:47.337
Uh, well, you know, uh,

16:47.387 --> 16:48.991
Ryan and I would be glad
to go check this out

16:49.041 --> 16:51.111
if you guys are too busy
solving that murder.

16:53.048 --> 16:54.590
I did what I could to help him,

16:54.640 --> 16:55.894
but I'd say it wasn't enough.

16:55.944 --> 16:57.678
Why did Jack Sinclair
come to see you?

16:57.728 --> 16:59.658
I've been in the McClaren house.

16:59.708 --> 17:01.817
He was going to face
whatever's in there,

17:01.867 --> 17:03.379
and he wanted my advice.

17:03.429 --> 17:05.578
Which you gave him... for a fee.

17:05.627 --> 17:07.724
I'm not a charlatan, detective.

17:07.775 --> 17:09.625
Someone with Jack
Sinclair's experience

17:09.675 --> 17:11.983
wouldn't be seeking
my counsel if I was.

17:12.034 --> 17:12.951
Please.

17:14.358 --> 17:17.114
If he was that good, why
would he seek your help?

17:18.053 --> 17:19.983
This was not like any
other house to him.

17:20.032 --> 17:21.596
When he took the assignment,

17:21.646 --> 17:23.425
the dreams started.

17:23.474 --> 17:25.580
Just glimpses at first,

17:25.631 --> 17:27.103
bits and pieces of a room,

17:27.156 --> 17:30.631
but then the dreams
became nightmares--

17:30.681 --> 17:33.613
figures, bodies.

17:33.663 --> 17:34.935
Whose bodies?

17:34.985 --> 17:36.131
He didn't know.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.425
But the more we talked,

17:37.475 --> 17:41.243
the more it became clear to
me, these weren't dreams.

17:41.293 --> 17:42.521
Well, what were they?

17:42.571 --> 17:44.202
Memories.

17:44.252 --> 17:46.665
He witnessed great evil.

17:47.613 --> 17:49.982
Repressed it all these years.

17:50.032 --> 17:51.794
But the memories were too strong.

17:51.844 --> 17:53.580
They were coming back.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.674
And what was he
remembering exactly?

17:55.724 --> 17:57.160
A woman,

17:57.210 --> 18:00.460
a lot of blood, a
man with a knife.

18:00.510 --> 18:01.900
Who was the man?

18:01.950 --> 18:05.419
He said the face was blurred
but getting clearer.

18:05.469 --> 18:06.994
I told him,

18:07.044 --> 18:09.589
if he returned to the
room where it happened,

18:09.639 --> 18:11.728
it might all come back to him.

18:11.778 --> 18:14.301
"Mercy, I can see it."
That's the murderer's face.

18:14.351 --> 18:17.758
Jack recovered the memory
just before he was killed.

18:17.808 --> 18:21.454
The last murder in that
house was 20 years ago.

18:21.504 --> 18:22.512
I read about the case.

18:22.562 --> 18:24.281
There were no witnesses.

18:24.331 --> 18:25.583
Oh, there was one.

18:25.627 --> 18:27.501
Jack Sinclair was there

18:27.551 --> 18:29.404
the night that woman died.

18:31.046 --> 18:32.491
He was there.

18:37.688 --> 18:38.988
The pictures aren't pretty.

18:39.038 --> 18:39.897
Melanie Benton,

18:39.947 --> 18:41.102
sliced up in the McClaren house

18:41.152 --> 18:43.671
on the night of April 20, 1991.

18:43.721 --> 18:45.096
One guess where she was found.

18:45.146 --> 18:45.984
The living room.

18:46.034 --> 18:46.855
Give that man a prize.

18:46.905 --> 18:49.915
So 1991, Jack
Sinclair is what, 11?

18:49.965 --> 18:51.384
Still living in the neighborhood.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.795
I'm betting this is the
murder he witnessed.

18:53.845 --> 18:55.475
Yeah, but how did
he witness a murder

18:55.525 --> 18:56.856
without the killer knowing?

18:56.906 --> 18:58.770
I did some digging.
Jack had a paper route,

18:58.820 --> 19:00.187
and the McClaren house was on it.

19:00.926 --> 19:03.741
Okay, so Jack shows up,
maybe to collect money,

19:04.388 --> 19:07.146
hears screams, and he peers
in through those windows.

19:07.196 --> 19:08.861
He started having dreams
about what he'd seen

19:08.911 --> 19:10.622
all those years ago, and he
wanted to make sense of them.

19:10.672 --> 19:12.768
And that's why our vic hired
Ron Berger to break in

19:12.818 --> 19:14.026
and take pictures
of the living room.

19:14.076 --> 19:15.531
Was there ever an arrest made?

19:15.581 --> 19:17.545
No, which means the killer
is still out there.

19:17.595 --> 19:20.050
So Jack Sinclair is just
about to recover his memory

19:20.100 --> 19:22.450
and possibly ID our killer,

19:22.500 --> 19:23.973
and he's silenced.

19:24.023 --> 19:26.084
Who was the investigating
officer on the case?

19:26.134 --> 19:27.333
I've been retired ten years,

19:27.383 --> 19:29.253
and I still think about this one.

19:29.303 --> 19:30.475
I was the first one on the scene,

19:30.525 --> 19:32.607
and I gotta tell you, the pictures
don't even do it justice,

19:32.657 --> 19:34.727
what Matt Benton did
to his poor wife.

19:34.777 --> 19:36.742
Matt Benton?
You think that Melanie was killed

19:36.792 --> 19:37.744
by her own husband?

19:37.794 --> 19:39.965
Well, the neighbors complained
about constant fighting.

19:40.015 --> 19:41.426
We put out an APB on Benton

19:41.476 --> 19:42.605
the night that Melanie
was murdered,

19:42.655 --> 19:45.017
but he got away, and he's
been on the lam ever since

19:45.067 --> 19:46.900
so it doesn't take a
genius to put it together.

19:46.950 --> 19:48.554
Did you ever hear anything
about his whereabouts

19:48.604 --> 19:49.530
after he disappeared?

19:49.580 --> 19:51.915
We got one tip once about
him being in Europe.

19:51.965 --> 19:54.184
But that--that's gotta be
a good 15 years ago now.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.302
So somebody spotted him?

19:55.352 --> 19:57.203
No, he sent postcards
to his brother.

19:57.253 --> 19:58.839
They were postmarked Vienna.

19:58.889 --> 20:00.757
What did they say?
Do you remember?

20:00.807 --> 20:02.270
They all said the same thing--

20:02.320 --> 20:04.566
Benton claimed he wasn't
responsible for his wife's death,

20:04.616 --> 20:06.132
something about a demon.

20:07.003 --> 20:08.992
Really? He claimed there
was a demon involved?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.540
I know. Like anyone's gonna
fall for that, right?

20:11.590 --> 20:14.417
I mean, what kind of jackass did
he think he was dealing with?

20:15.675 --> 20:17.767
Did you ever follow up on
any of those postcards,

20:17.817 --> 20:18.770
detective Smith?

20:18.820 --> 20:20.011
We got Interpol involved,

20:20.061 --> 20:21.983
but without any hard
evidence against the guy--

20:22.033 --> 20:23.977
no murder weapon, no
witness-- you know,

20:24.027 --> 20:25.950
I don't think they ever
took it too seriously.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.874
And what if a witness
came forward now,

20:27.924 --> 20:29.396
would that change anything?

20:29.446 --> 20:30.891
That would change everything.

20:32.272 --> 20:35.409
It sounds more and more like
Matt Benton found out about Jack

20:35.459 --> 20:36.826
and decided to keep him quiet.

20:36.876 --> 20:38.119
But how did Matt find out

20:38.169 --> 20:40.011
that Jack was recovering
his memories?

20:40.061 --> 20:41.005
I have an idea about that.

20:41.055 --> 20:42.755
I was rechecking our
vic's phone records.

20:42.805 --> 20:44.571
It turns out, a week
before he died,

20:44.621 --> 20:45.553
Jack Sinclair called

20:45.603 --> 20:47.920
the law firm of Lockhart,
Whelan and Benton.

20:47.970 --> 20:49.161
Benton? As in--

20:49.211 --> 20:50.947
Pete Benton, Matt's brother.

20:50.997 --> 20:52.962
That's the brother that Matt was
sending those postcards to and--

20:53.012 --> 20:55.023
Pete could have
easily alerted Matt

20:55.073 --> 20:56.598
that someone was
asking questions,

20:56.648 --> 20:58.050
the wrong kind of questions.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.155
My brother sent me those
postcards over 15 years ago.

21:03.205 --> 21:05.953
I gave them to the cops.
I haven't heard from him since.

21:06.003 --> 21:08.146
And no contact since then,
Mr. Benton?

21:08.196 --> 21:08.803
No.

21:08.853 --> 21:11.191
Not even after talking
to Jack Sinclair?

21:11.715 --> 21:12.833
Jack Sinclair?

21:12.883 --> 21:13.860
The ghost hunter.

21:13.910 --> 21:16.229
He was killed in the
McClaren house last night.

21:16.279 --> 21:17.781
I never spoke to Jack Sinclair.

21:17.831 --> 21:19.898
Well, his phone records
show otherwise.

21:19.948 --> 21:22.187
I get calls every year
from some TV producer

21:22.240 --> 21:24.254
looking to exploit
my family's tragedy

21:24.304 --> 21:26.788
and the legend of the
McClaren mansion.

21:27.210 --> 21:29.439
Look, it's a shame, whatever
happened to this guy.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.246
But if he called here,
I did not talk to him.

21:32.756 --> 21:35.039
And I certainly haven't
spoken to my brother.

21:35.089 --> 21:36.865
So if we check your
phone records,

21:36.915 --> 21:38.607
we won't find calls to Vienna?

21:38.657 --> 21:39.883
We're an international law firm.

21:39.933 --> 21:42.223
We have clients all over
Europe, including Vienna.

21:42.273 --> 21:44.013
We're gonna need access
to those phone logs.

21:44.063 --> 21:45.100
Then you need a warrant,

21:45.150 --> 21:47.180
and you don't have
enough to get one.

21:48.025 --> 21:50.426
Mr. Benton, your
car is downstairs.

21:50.487 --> 21:53.719
The law firm's car service
of choice is Execu-drive.

21:53.769 --> 21:55.018
Here are Pete Benton's
billing slips

21:55.080 --> 21:56.276
going back a month or so.

21:56.326 --> 21:57.622
Was there any unusual activity?

21:57.672 --> 21:59.734
Uh, daily routine's the
same to and from work,

21:59.784 --> 22:01.300
except for four days ago,

22:01.350 --> 22:04.097
when Pete authorized
a pickup at JFK,

22:04.147 --> 22:05.383
international terminal.

22:05.433 --> 22:07.838
Okay. So maybe Pete did have
his brother on speed dial.

22:07.888 --> 22:08.550
Where'd they go?

22:08.600 --> 22:09.703
Fairwyck hotel.

22:09.753 --> 22:12.159
All right, let's take
this down to the Fairwyck

22:12.209 --> 22:14.585
and see if anybody
recognizes Matt Benton.

22:14.635 --> 22:17.445
Actually, I had tech mock up an
aged-up version of the photo,

22:17.495 --> 22:19.470
- you know, Matt 20 years later.
 -Mm.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.405
Wait a minute. Don't you guys
have dinner plans tonight?

22:21.455 --> 22:22.696
Uh, we can move it to...

22:22.746 --> 22:25.116
some night when Lanie's not
coming off a double shift.

22:25.166 --> 22:27.256
Uh, actually, Lanie's really
looking forward to it.

22:27.306 --> 22:29.534
You know what? No worries.
It's on my way home.

22:30.185 --> 22:31.058
You sure?

22:31.108 --> 22:32.184
That I don't want to
be the one to blame

22:32.234 --> 22:34.973
for ruining Lanie's night out?
Oh, yeah. I am sure.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.374
Honestly, Richard,

22:37.424 --> 22:38.940
how do you plan to solve
a 1-day-old murder

22:38.990 --> 22:41.166
by reading a book about
a 100-year-old house?

22:41.216 --> 22:42.847
You sound just like Beckett.

22:42.897 --> 22:45.707
There has to be a reason why
all these things happened

22:45.757 --> 22:46.534
in the living room--

22:46.584 --> 22:47.880
all these murders, uh,

22:47.930 --> 22:49.912
the tenants who had their
furniture smashed,

22:49.962 --> 22:51.568
all in the same room.

22:51.618 --> 22:53.688
Maybe that demon of yours

22:53.732 --> 22:55.131
did not like the furniture.

22:55.181 --> 22:57.673
You bring in a decorator,
snazz up the place...

22:57.723 --> 22:59.318
All this nonsense might stop.

22:59.368 --> 23:00.471
Less like Beckett.

23:00.990 --> 23:02.010
Oh.

23:02.417 --> 23:03.952
No need of snazzing up here.

23:04.002 --> 23:05.994
Look at you. Wow.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.386
You're really taking these Skype
dates with Ashley seriously.

23:08.436 --> 23:09.864
I'm going to a party.

23:09.914 --> 23:12.195
Ash was supposed to
call me hours ago,

23:12.245 --> 23:14.298
but I'm tired of waiting.

23:14.348 --> 23:15.970
Oh, good for you, sweetheart.

23:16.020 --> 23:16.955
Have a good time.

23:17.005 --> 23:18.934
Thanks, dad.
I'll be back by midnight.

23:18.984 --> 23:19.569
Thank you.

23:19.619 --> 23:20.483
Bye.

23:21.750 --> 23:22.506
Wow.

23:22.614 --> 23:24.257
Did you see that outfit?
Should I be worried?

23:24.307 --> 23:26.342
Ashley's the one who
should be worried.

23:26.392 --> 23:29.198
Trust me, if he could see how
she looked going out now,

23:29.248 --> 23:31.600
he wouldn't be so quick
to leave her hanging.

23:32.207 --> 23:35.035
Oh, isn't this funny?
It's Ashley.

23:35.085 --> 23:36.268
Decline.

23:36.318 --> 23:37.003
It's almost as if

23:37.053 --> 23:39.312
he was listening in
to our conversation.

23:40.342 --> 23:41.543
Listening in.

23:42.704 --> 23:44.604
The architect for
the McClaren house,

23:44.654 --> 23:45.951
he's from Scotland.

23:46.672 --> 23:48.207
I-is that important?

23:48.257 --> 23:49.492
It's the key.

23:51.889 --> 23:53.068
Two words--

23:53.118 --> 23:54.396
laird's lug.

23:55.707 --> 23:56.856
Laird's lug?

23:56.906 --> 23:58.412
Literally "lord's ear."

23:58.462 --> 24:01.027
It refers to the hidden
alcove above a dining hall

24:01.077 --> 24:02.714
of many Scottish Castles.

24:02.764 --> 24:05.574
The host could use it to
eavesdrop on his guests.

24:05.624 --> 24:07.597
I think I've either had too
much wine or not enough.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.236
Seamus McClaren, builder
of the McClaren house,

24:10.286 --> 24:12.366
grew up right next
to Edinburgh Castle,

24:12.416 --> 24:14.161
notable for its laird's lug.

24:14.211 --> 24:15.463
The concept so tickled him,

24:15.513 --> 24:17.932
he put modern versions of it
into several of his houses.

24:17.982 --> 24:19.711
So you're saying that
the McClaren house

24:19.761 --> 24:21.048
has a hidden alcove?

24:21.098 --> 24:22.869
It explains everything.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.629
How come the killings only
happen in that one room?

24:24.673 --> 24:27.303
How does the killer seemingly
appear and disappear at will?

24:27.353 --> 24:29.791
Answers that have, thus
far, remained elusive.

24:29.841 --> 24:31.999
Speaking of which, how
did your canvassing go?

24:32.049 --> 24:33.442
I came up empty.

24:33.492 --> 24:35.527
There's absolutely no
evidence that Matt Benton

24:35.577 --> 24:36.970
was ever at the Fairwyck.

24:37.020 --> 24:39.266
Maybe the evidence of his
return will be in that alcove.

24:39.336 --> 24:40.647
It's worth a shot.

24:40.697 --> 24:41.693
We'll go first thing
in the morning,

24:41.743 --> 24:42.908
see what we come up with.

24:44.879 --> 24:45.822
You want to go now?

24:45.872 --> 24:47.993
Well, unless, of
course, you're afraid.

24:48.043 --> 24:49.480
- Yeah, right.
- No, I get it.

24:49.533 --> 24:51.582
I mean, it is a haunted house.

24:51.632 --> 24:53.652
- I'm not scared, Castle.
- No, no, you're right.

24:53.702 --> 24:56.312
You're right. I mean, the
demon has tasted fresh blood.

24:56.362 --> 24:59.250
Its--its thirst may not be
slaked with just one victim.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.860
Okay, come on.

25:01.450 --> 25:02.743
Listen, if-- if
you're not scared,

25:03.284 --> 25:04.925
- just say it.
- No.

25:05.598 --> 25:06.690
Come on. You know you want to.

25:06.691 --> 25:08.124
I don't want to say it, Castle.

25:08.438 --> 25:10.162
For me. Please.

25:12.190 --> 25:14.397
I ain't afraid a' no ghosts.

25:15.634 --> 25:16.777
Thank you.

25:22.268 --> 25:23.594
I don't know, Castle,
there have been

25:23.595 --> 25:26.381
in here over the years,

25:26.382 --> 25:28.770
and I think they would've
found a secret room

25:28.771 --> 25:30.026
if there actually was one.

25:30.027 --> 25:31.421
Not if it was hidden well enough.

25:33.044 --> 25:35.854
You know, you're gonna regret it
if we actually find this room.

25:35.855 --> 25:36.487
Why is that?

25:36.488 --> 25:37.936
Because then you're
gonna have to admit

25:37.937 --> 25:40.175
that there is no demon
behind all of this.

25:40.176 --> 25:44.091
Hiding ia a room.

25:44.092 --> 25:46.960
Well, unless it's a psycho
killer posessed by a demon.

25:46.961 --> 25:49.555
Why are you so determined
to find the supernatural in all this?

25:49.556 --> 25:50.829
Why are you so determined not to?

25:50.830 --> 25:53.195
You know what? I am just
following the evidence

25:53.196 --> 25:55.002
wherever it may lead,

25:55.455 --> 25:56.899
and as a cop, I'm
going to consider

25:56.900 --> 25:59.523
every possible
worldly explanation.

26:00.277 --> 26:01.843
And what if there is none?

26:01.844 --> 26:03.803
Well, then I'm open
to the atlternatives.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.110
- You? Skepticus Maximus?
- You know what?

26:08.111 --> 26:10.350
Just because I don't
talk about it nonstop

26:10.351 --> 26:13.410
doesn't mean I don't
believe in another plane.

26:13.411 --> 26:15.135
I've actually had
my own experiences.

26:15.136 --> 26:17.162
Get out! Like what?

26:18.187 --> 26:19.005
When I was a little girl,

26:19.006 --> 26:21.332
my parents rented a
cabin by a lake

26:21.333 --> 26:24.163
and when I had to go
to the bathroom

26:25.619 --> 26:27.604
You know what? You're
just gonna think I'm crazy.

26:27.605 --> 26:29.109
No, no, no. Go ahead,
tell me.

26:29.901 --> 26:32.562
And on the way there

26:33.024 --> 26:37.052
I heard this voice
whispering

26:37.053 --> 26:39.952
"Kate, Kate."

26:39.953 --> 26:42.118
It was coming from this room

26:42.119 --> 26:43.884
that the owners had locked up

26:44.367 --> 26:46.473
and told my parents.
never to go in it.

26:46.847 --> 26:49.600
Except that night there was this
weird glow underneath the door.

26:49.639 --> 26:52.153
Then I heard the voice
again: "Kate".

26:53.036 --> 26:54.902
And so I walked up to the door

26:55.534 --> 26:57.963
and this time it wasn't locked.

26:57.995 --> 27:01.831
And I turned the doornob and I opened
it up and then I saw it.

27:03.837 --> 27:05.524
What was it? What did you see?

27:08.646 --> 27:10.649
Ah, ha ha. Very funny.

27:11.151 --> 27:12.385
Yes, you got me.

27:12.386 --> 27:14.110
How long have you
known me, Castle?

27:14.111 --> 27:16.288
Of course I don't
believe in ghosts.

27:18.155 --> 27:19.349
What was that?

27:21.998 --> 27:23.162
Well, that's odd.

27:23.163 --> 27:25.488
No, that's more than just odd.

27:25.489 --> 27:27.677
This is the same
sequence of events

27:27.678 --> 27:29.482
that preceded Jack
Sinclair's murder.

27:29.483 --> 27:31.501
Except Jack only had an
EMF meter.

27:31.502 --> 27:34.200
I've got a gun and a flashlight.

27:35.705 --> 27:36.859
With dead batteries.

27:37.191 --> 27:39.247
I could swear I just
put in new ones.

27:39.248 --> 27:42.779
I know I saw some matches by
one of these candles here.

27:48.139 --> 27:49.877
- Wow, Castle. Mature.
- Right. Sorry.

27:51.243 --> 27:52.447
Yeah. Here we go.

28:02.703 --> 28:03.768
Castle...

28:03.769 --> 28:04.992
That was not me.

28:05.854 --> 28:09.407
Okay.
So maybe there's a draft here.

28:09.971 --> 28:10.993
Right?

28:12.780 --> 28:14.394
Wait.
I think I feel it right here.

28:14.395 --> 28:15.387
Give me a boost.

28:15.388 --> 28:17.173
- Okay. Ready?
- Yeah.

28:21.748 --> 28:23.293
Oh, God, Castle.

28:24.127 --> 28:26.346
- Oh, yeah, this is easy.
- Ohh.

28:30.286 --> 28:32.584
Castle, come on. Just hold still.

28:32.915 --> 28:33.987
Jeez.

28:36.419 --> 28:37.718
That's the noise on the tape

28:37.719 --> 28:39.634
right before Jack
Sinclair was killed.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.009
Okay.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.399
I'm gonna go up. Ready?

28:43.730 --> 28:44.895
Grab my legs.

28:46.219 --> 28:47.765
Castle, I said legs. Okay?

28:47.766 --> 28:49.050
Oh, legs.

28:49.051 --> 28:50.102
Sorry.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.269
Not as sorry as I was.

28:52.270 --> 28:53.986
I'm around dead people all day.

28:53.987 --> 28:56.173
When I get home, I
want a live one.

28:56.696 --> 28:57.750
I was tired.

28:59.306 --> 29:01.233
I can't believe we waited
this long to do this, babe.

29:01.234 --> 29:03.993
Yeah, yeah. It really did turn
out to be a perfect night.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.292
I would like to propose a toast.

29:07.293 --> 29:09.380
I know that it's kind of corny,

29:09.381 --> 29:11.237
but it's me so,
well, there we go.

29:11.238 --> 29:12.863
Uh, to best friends,

29:12.864 --> 29:14.338
now and forever.

29:15.191 --> 29:16.232
Cheers.

29:16.233 --> 29:17.419
And to the future newlyweds.

29:18.353 --> 29:20.509
- Cheers.
- You are so thoughtful.

29:21.643 --> 29:23.991
You know, Kevin said you guys
made a great couple, but...

29:24.321 --> 29:25.746
I had no idea.

29:26.087 --> 29:27.200
So...

29:27.551 --> 29:28.885
When are you two getting married?

29:37.126 --> 29:39.223
Isn't this awkward?

29:39.224 --> 29:40.577
Yeah, well, secret passageways

29:40.578 --> 29:43.268
aren't supposed to be the
most convenient of places.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.936
The killer could have hung
upside down from this bar

29:45.937 --> 29:47.762
when he slit Jack
Sinclair's throat.

29:47.763 --> 29:49.812
That would provide you with
your demon-free explanation

29:49.813 --> 29:51.809
of the undisturbed blood spatter.

29:51.810 --> 29:54.135
Look, Castle, I
appreciate the assist,

29:54.136 --> 29:56.073
but I could do
without the massage.

29:56.326 --> 29:57.054
What are you talking about?

29:57.055 --> 29:58.399
Aren't you rubbing my neck?

29:59.693 --> 30:00.778
No.

30:03.916 --> 30:04.903
Deep breaths, Castle.

30:04.904 --> 30:05.997
It's just a rat.

30:06.951 --> 30:08.002
There's something over there.

30:08.003 --> 30:08.845
Come on.

30:10.671 --> 30:12.432
Hidden passageways, secret rooms?

30:12.433 --> 30:13.306
I don't know, Castle.

30:13.307 --> 30:14.900
The mystery of the
McClaren mansion's

30:14.901 --> 30:17.129
looking less supernatural
by the minute.

30:17.952 --> 30:19.166
What is this?

30:25.019 --> 30:26.921
It's a magnetic field generator

30:27.153 --> 30:29.612
to knock out the video
feed to the cameras.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.779
Boy, someone planned
very carefully

30:31.780 --> 30:34.478
how to kill Jack Sinclair the
night he was filming here.

30:35.692 --> 30:36.797
It's taxing the power supply.

30:36.798 --> 30:38.069
That could explain the
lights flickering

30:38.070 --> 30:39.468
just before Jack's death.

30:39.469 --> 30:41.735
You know, the magnetic
field would also explain

30:41.736 --> 30:44.021
that tripod moving that
we saw in the video.

30:44.022 --> 30:45.620
Castle, look at these marks.

30:46.624 --> 30:47.446
There was a bed here.

30:47.447 --> 30:48.525
Matt Benton could've been here

30:48.526 --> 30:50.855
for days before Jack
even showed up.

30:50.856 --> 30:53.324
You know, this house has
been largely unoccupied

30:53.325 --> 30:54.749
since the Melanie Benton killing.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.425
Maybe the reason they
couldn't find Matt Benton

30:56.426 --> 30:58.152
is because he never left.

30:58.534 --> 31:00.128
He could've been living
here the whole time.

31:02.858 --> 31:04.674
And maybe he's here right now.

31:04.675 --> 31:05.599
Open the door.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.048
Oh, my God. My heart.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.333
I was so scared.

31:24.810 --> 31:25.681
What?

31:27.927 --> 31:29.874
Really?! Really?

31:32.764 --> 31:34.139
I am throwing away this coat.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.229
Look, his cuffs are monogrammed.

31:38.092 --> 31:39.295
"MB."

31:39.390 --> 31:41.008
Looks like you were
right, Castle.

31:41.592 --> 31:44.100
Matt Benton never did leave
the McClaren mansion.

31:49.451 --> 31:50.916
Dental records confirm it.

31:50.917 --> 31:52.471
That's Matt Benton.

31:52.825 --> 31:54.469
Tech really needs
better software.

31:54.470 --> 31:56.225
- Cause of death?
- Don't know yet,

31:56.226 --> 31:58.061
but I'm guessing it wasn't
the world's longest game

31:58.062 --> 31:59.003
of hide-and-seek.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.245
How long was he in there for?

32:00.246 --> 32:01.886
Still waiting on
the test results,

32:01.887 --> 32:04.194
but the prelim reports on
the tissue samples suggests

32:04.195 --> 32:05.941
he died about 20 years ago.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.581
Okay, so then odds are he
was killed at the same time

32:08.582 --> 32:10.146
his wife Melanie was.

32:10.568 --> 32:12.265
So the killer hides Matt's body,

32:12.266 --> 32:13.686
making it appear
as though he fled,

32:13.687 --> 32:15.230
framing Matt for
his wife's murder

32:15.231 --> 32:17.658
and throwing everyone off the
trail of the real killer.

32:17.659 --> 32:19.441
And it worked, too, for 20 years.

32:19.442 --> 32:21.340
Yeah, until Jack
Sinclair showed up.

32:21.786 --> 32:23.999
- Let me know about the test results.
- Okay.

32:25.857 --> 32:27.313
How'd that double date go?

32:29.421 --> 32:30.475
I-I just...

32:32.822 --> 32:34.989
You guys... one thing.

32:34.990 --> 32:37.599
If Matt was killed 20 years ago,

32:37.600 --> 32:41.403
then how'd he send those
postcards to Pete 15 years ago?

32:42.428 --> 32:44.744
I think it's time we took a
harder look at Pete Benton.

32:45.177 --> 32:46.550
Don't ask about the date.

32:49.371 --> 32:51.058
Look, I said I'm sorry, okay?

32:51.569 --> 32:52.589
I didn't mean to jinx the dinner.

32:52.590 --> 32:54.264
"This really is the
perfect night."

32:54.265 --> 32:56.347
Jenny got a little
caught up in the moment.

32:56.348 --> 32:57.739
"When are you two
getting married"?

32:57.740 --> 32:59.605
That's a question you do not ask.

33:01.570 --> 33:02.817
All right, you know, it's--

33:02.818 --> 33:04.729
it's not entirely
you guys' fault.

33:04.730 --> 33:05.860
You guys have a big fight after?

33:05.861 --> 33:07.384
Big fight? No.

33:07.385 --> 33:08.568
Mega fight? Yes.

33:08.569 --> 33:11.036
The point is... we, um,

33:11.408 --> 33:13.103
we decided that we're
gonna cool things off.

33:13.104 --> 33:14.850
- What, you mean split up?
- Yeah.

33:14.851 --> 33:16.767
Just until we both
figure out what we want.

33:17.170 --> 33:18.444
Man, I'm so sorry.

33:18.445 --> 33:19.118
Anyway...

33:19.119 --> 33:21.344
Look, brother, if you
need me for anything,

33:21.345 --> 33:23.643
you know I'm always
here to-- what?

33:25.019 --> 33:26.332
Well, maybe nothing, but...

33:26.895 --> 33:28.099
this lightbulb...

33:28.923 --> 33:30.106
is brand-new.

33:30.760 --> 33:31.922
Are you kidding me?

33:32.245 --> 33:34.201
Detective, this is
bordering on harassment.

33:34.202 --> 33:36.005
I told you everything I
know about my brother.

33:36.006 --> 33:36.719
Not everything.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.017
You were engaged once,
weren't you, Mr. Benton?

33:39.018 --> 33:40.420
To a Melanie Wendell.

33:40.421 --> 33:41.586
Until Melanie broke it off

33:41.587 --> 33:43.663
and married your brother instead.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.348
Things didn't work out for us.

33:47.731 --> 33:50.217
I didn't expect Melanie
to stay single forever.

33:50.218 --> 33:51.542
But you never married,

33:51.962 --> 33:53.568
because you never got
over her, did you?

33:53.569 --> 33:55.553
Who really sent those
postcards, Pete?

33:55.554 --> 33:56.609
Did you send 'em yourself?

33:56.610 --> 33:57.484
What the hell are
you talking about?

33:57.485 --> 33:59.068
My brother sent me
those postcards.

33:59.069 --> 34:01.378
You and I both know
that's not possible.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.208
Your brother has been
dead for 20 years.

34:06.293 --> 34:07.055
What?

34:07.056 --> 34:09.916
We found his remains
in the McClaren house.

34:10.697 --> 34:11.398
It's over.

34:11.399 --> 34:13.164
You think I killed my brother?

34:13.165 --> 34:14.643
You think I killed Melanie?

34:14.645 --> 34:16.210
Where were you that night, Pete?

34:19.931 --> 34:22.962
I'll tell you exactly
where I was.

34:22.963 --> 34:25.614
I went to dinner with
my friend Marie--

34:26.828 --> 34:29.612
&:30, cafe Jouer.

34:29.965 --> 34:30.898
We were out by 9:00.

34:30.899 --> 34:33.025
We stopped at
Dorian's for a drink.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.882
I had a 7 and 7.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.998
Our server was Patrick.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.608
When something like that happens,

34:40.609 --> 34:42.255
it's burned into your brain,

34:42.255 --> 34:44.681
every detail of what happened
the night you heard.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.768
I couldn't forget it if I tried.

34:51.045 --> 34:53.331
We're gonna have to
verify your story, Pete.

34:53.333 --> 34:54.967
So... my--

34:54.969 --> 34:57.175
my brother didn't kill Melanie?

34:57.176 --> 34:58.579
We don't think so.

34:58.952 --> 35:00.515
I've always assumed that he did.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.512
Matt had a terrible temper.

35:02.894 --> 35:05.383
He was convinced that Melanie
was cheating on him.

35:05.755 --> 35:06.465
Was she?

35:06.466 --> 35:08.672
Wouldn't surprise me if she was.

35:08.673 --> 35:11.009
Matt thought it was
somebody at work.

35:11.411 --> 35:12.635
It wasn't someone
Melanie worked with.

35:12.636 --> 35:14.471
I just tracked down
George Banner,

35:14.472 --> 35:17.393
Melanie's manager at Fly-Wide
Travel from 20 years ago.

35:17.469 --> 35:19.331
He said Melanie had
two coworkers,

35:19.332 --> 35:20.644
both guys... uh-huh.

35:20.645 --> 35:21.664
Married... still.

35:21.665 --> 35:23.139
- To each other.
- Oh.

35:23.581 --> 35:26.281
Well, Fly-Wide was in a
high-rise in midtown.

35:26.282 --> 35:27.949
So maybe it was someone
else in the building.

35:27.950 --> 35:29.684
Let's get a list of all the
tenants that were there

35:29.685 --> 35:30.695
when Melanie worked there.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.041
I'm not sure that's necessary.

35:32.042 --> 35:33.586
Remember the lightbulb I
took from that secret room?

35:33.625 --> 35:34.203
Yeah.

35:34.218 --> 35:35.422
Well, I traced
the serial number.

35:35.423 --> 35:37.711
It belongs to a lot that was
sold by the manufacturer

35:37.712 --> 35:40.079
directly to Fuller
estate management.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.661
- As in Steve Fuller?
- Owner of the McClaren mansion.

35:42.662 --> 35:45.268
That means that Fuller knew about
that room and didn't tell us.

35:45.269 --> 35:47.998
There's only reason why
he wouldn't tell us.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.049
Because he's the killer.

35:51.802 --> 35:53.623
Maybe Matt Benton was right
about Melanie having an affair,

35:53.624 --> 35:56.051
only wrong about who she was
having the affair with.

35:56.052 --> 35:58.096
And when things
went bad, he killed her,

35:58.097 --> 36:00.382
killed Matt, and stashed
his body in his own house

36:00.383 --> 36:01.385
where he knew no
one would find it.

36:01.386 --> 36:03.482
And he planned on
destroying the evidence.

36:03.483 --> 36:04.916
He wanted to have
the house torn down

36:04.917 --> 36:06.802
right after those murders, but
it was declared a landmark.

36:06.803 --> 36:08.501
So he used that
passageway to scare off

36:08.502 --> 36:10.919
tenants like the Boyers,
growing the mansion's legend

36:10.920 --> 36:11.985
so that no one would
want to live there.

36:11.986 --> 36:13.678
And then when Jack Sinclair
came sniffing around,

36:13.679 --> 36:14.913
he had to kill him, too.

36:14.914 --> 36:15.936
You guys.

36:16.702 --> 36:19.166
Great story. The DA
will never buy it.

36:19.167 --> 36:20.522
It's all circumstantial.

36:20.523 --> 36:21.507
She's right.

36:21.508 --> 36:23.263
Anyone could've put
that bulb in there.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.589
We have no proof.

36:26.527 --> 36:27.840
But we will.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.327
And I think I know just
how to get Mr. Fuller

36:30.328 --> 36:32.715
to give up the ghost.

36:38.769 --> 36:40.947
- Think he'll show?
- I don't know.

36:40.948 --> 36:43.371
- You told him about tomorrow, right?
- Yes, Castle.

36:43.372 --> 36:45.679
He thinks we're going through
that wall in the morning.

36:46.031 --> 36:47.415
So if Fuller's our guy,

36:47.739 --> 36:50.249
he should be coming for
Matt Benton's body tonight.

36:50.250 --> 36:53.411
If he's our guy.
I mean, he might not be our guy.

36:54.095 --> 36:56.472
And yet, there he is.

36:57.988 --> 37:00.718
Of course, he might just be
here to fix a busted toilet.

37:17.286 --> 37:18.882
Need a hand with that, Fuller?

37:21.199 --> 37:22.964
Detective Smith?

37:23.446 --> 37:25.333
Detective Beckett.

37:25.842 --> 37:27.690
It was... you...

37:27.691 --> 37:29.486
all this time. Why?

37:31.283 --> 37:33.951
You know, he was abusing her.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.124
Terrible things.

37:35.125 --> 37:36.057
I don't think a month went by,

37:36.058 --> 37:37.723
we didn't get called
up to this house.

37:37.724 --> 37:40.521
And one day, I stopped by in
the afternoon to check on her.

37:40.522 --> 37:41.458
You were the affair.

37:41.459 --> 37:42.954
It wasn't an affair.

37:43.828 --> 37:44.881
It was love.

37:44.882 --> 37:46.436
Then why'd you kill her?

37:47.269 --> 37:48.974
I didn't mean to. It just...

37:48.975 --> 37:50.532
She wanted to call
it off with me.

37:50.533 --> 37:52.017
And I couldn't let that happen.

37:52.018 --> 37:53.300
And Matt Benton?

37:53.301 --> 37:55.830
The way he treated her,
he deserved what he got.

37:55.831 --> 37:56.822
And as the lead officer,

37:56.823 --> 37:59.063
you knew you could steer the
investigation off yourself

37:59.064 --> 38:00.652
and on to someone
they'd never find.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.347
And then you sent those postcards

38:02.348 --> 38:03.849
to keep your suspect alive.

38:03.850 --> 38:05.584
I had 'em think that he did it.

38:06.006 --> 38:07.339
It was his fault anyway.

38:07.340 --> 38:09.690
What about Jack Sinclair?
How'd you find out about him?

38:10.052 --> 38:14.645
I promised Fuller that I would
solve this case one day.

38:14.646 --> 38:17.680
I asked him to keep me
informed of any developments.

38:17.681 --> 38:20.805
So that when Jack contacted
Fuller about the crime scene,

38:20.806 --> 38:21.841
he called you.

38:21.842 --> 38:23.385
And when we told
Fuller we were gonna

38:23.386 --> 38:24.921
check out that room tomorrow,

38:25.393 --> 38:26.949
he called you then, too.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.905
You're both very smart.

38:29.306 --> 38:31.402
But you're forgetting one thing.

38:31.783 --> 38:33.257
This house is haunted.

38:37.904 --> 38:40.334
Thanks for the gun, detective.
I really appreciate it.

38:40.786 --> 38:44.046
You know, I felt bad about Sinclair.
I really did.

38:44.478 --> 38:46.333
But he knew too much
about that night,

38:46.334 --> 38:47.897
stuff that wasn't in the papers.

38:47.898 --> 38:49.204
So he had to go.

38:50.327 --> 38:51.661
Get on your knees.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.819
Don't worry, Castle.
He's not gonna shoot us.

38:54.279 --> 38:55.966
That won't fit the legend.

38:58.976 --> 39:01.645
Any more helpful hints you'd care
to pass along to our killer?

39:02.029 --> 39:03.119
On your knees.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.765
I don't think so, Addison.

39:04.766 --> 39:06.180
Y-you see, the demon

39:06.181 --> 39:08.980
only really kills when
no one's looking.

39:09.374 --> 39:12.733
And tonight, we have an audience.

39:15.435 --> 39:17.261
They recorded your
full confession.

39:22.757 --> 39:23.723
You have a right
to remain silent.

39:23.724 --> 39:24.845
So busted.

39:24.846 --> 39:26.300
Ghost busted,

39:26.301 --> 39:27.646
thanks to Lulu.

39:27.647 --> 39:29.732
It's the least I could
do for him, you know?

39:30.072 --> 39:31.263
For Jack.

39:33.914 --> 39:35.918
So Fuller had no idea
about that room?

39:35.919 --> 39:38.130
Well, like we said before,
anyone could've grabbed

39:38.131 --> 39:39.925
the lightbulb from another
part of the house

39:39.926 --> 39:42.188
and placed it there.
I guess Smith did it.

39:42.888 --> 39:44.985
He's in with the DA
right now writing his confession.

39:44.986 --> 39:46.129
Yeah, well, what I don't get is,

39:46.130 --> 39:48.347
if he was so in love with
Melanie, why would he kill her?

39:48.348 --> 39:50.333
He said that a demon
made him do it.

39:50.745 --> 39:53.903
Just laying the groundwork for
his insanity plea, I'm sure.

39:53.904 --> 39:54.916
Perhaps.

39:54.917 --> 39:57.094
Oh, come on, Castle,
even you have to admit,

39:57.095 --> 40:00.505
everything--every
haunting, every death,

40:00.506 --> 40:02.502
everything even
remotely connected

40:02.503 --> 40:04.402
to paranormal activity
in the McClaren house

40:04.403 --> 40:06.418
can be explained by
that passageway.

40:06.780 --> 40:07.652
I don't know.

40:07.653 --> 40:09.586
What about last night when
we were in the living room?

40:09.587 --> 40:12.458
How about the door, the
light, the candle?

40:12.459 --> 40:14.807
Old wiring, drafty house.

40:14.808 --> 40:16.803
Or maybe it was something more.

40:16.804 --> 40:18.417
Think about it, if you
hadn't gone looking for

40:18.418 --> 40:20.165
the draft that blew
out the candle

40:20.166 --> 40:21.860
you would never have
found the passageway

40:22.333 --> 40:23.537
or Matt Benton's body.

40:23.538 --> 40:26.940
Spell it out for those of us
that are paranormally impaired.

40:26.941 --> 40:30.134
Maybe someone wanted us
to find that passageway.

40:30.837 --> 40:31.820
Maybe...

40:32.647 --> 40:34.093
Jack Sinclair's ghost

40:34.364 --> 40:36.944
was helping solve his own murder.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.065
Okay, I'll tell you what.

40:43.395 --> 40:45.399
I will admit to that possibility

40:45.840 --> 40:47.575
- if you admit there is no demon.
- Done.

40:54.521 --> 40:55.660
Did anyone see...

40:56.041 --> 40:57.305
That was weird.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.481
Hi, dad.

41:02.482 --> 41:03.766
Hey, you're up late.

41:04.180 --> 41:06.308
Playing Skype-tag with Ashley?

41:06.659 --> 41:08.432
No. We finally connected.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.248
Ah. Was it everything
you hoped for

41:10.249 --> 41:12.509
in a peer-to-peer video
conference and more?

41:13.221 --> 41:14.576
Honestly, it was...

41:15.048 --> 41:15.963
blah.

41:15.964 --> 41:18.530
I mean, he was preoccupied,
and I was tired.

41:18.531 --> 41:21.051
And this whole time-difference
thing is a real drag.

41:21.052 --> 41:23.570
Nobody said that long
distance was easy.

41:23.571 --> 41:25.828
Yeah, but is it supposed
to be this hard?

41:26.682 --> 41:28.498
Well, I can tell you this...

41:29.371 --> 41:30.665
Any relationship

41:31.087 --> 41:32.686
that lasts longer
than a breath mint

41:32.687 --> 41:34.282
is going to have challenges.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.429
But if a relationship
doesn't work out,

41:36.430 --> 41:39.181
it's usually not because
of the challenges.

41:39.593 --> 41:40.957
It's usually because

41:40.958 --> 41:44.347
the relationship wasn't
strong enough to begin with.

41:45.653 --> 41:46.977
Does this help?

41:48.322 --> 41:49.526
- Not really.
- Yeah.

41:53.802 --> 41:55.226
But this always does.

41:58.078 --> 41:59.432
I can promise you this.

42:01.329 --> 42:04.015
If two people believe in
something, really believe,

42:05.389 --> 42:07.858
anything, even the impossible,

42:08.177 --> 42:09.432
is possible.

42:13.647 --> 42:14.780
Even...

42:14.781 --> 42:17.150
flesh-eating zombies?

42:17.151 --> 42:21.004
Oh, especially
flesh-eating zombies.

42:21.536 --> 42:22.747
Now where were we?

42:22.748 --> 42:23.722
Yeah, right there.
