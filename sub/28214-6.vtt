America Goes Poddy is sponsored

01:27.459 --> 01:30.877
BURGH [podcast]: So, Bill, what's on tap
for America Goes Poddy this week?

01:30.941 --> 01:32.795
More lies from "Individual #1?"

01:32.850 --> 01:35.421
MORAY: Uh, no, it's a positive story,
actually.

01:35.478 --> 01:37.562
Democrats are suddenly
doing well.

01:37.616 --> 01:40.318
And the question being asked
by all my bro friends is,

01:40.842 --> 01:42.560
"Who is cutting into
Trump's base?"

01:42.624 --> 01:44.085
BURGH: You're talking about
the taking down

01:44.139 --> 01:45.761
- of the Republican troll farms?
MORAY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.252
But also the doxing
of the Red Jackets

01:47.286 --> 01:49.239
when they tried some
uncool voter intimidation.

01:49.293 --> 01:50.702
BURGH: And the country singer,
Sabrina Wynne,

01:50.736 --> 01:52.293
she finally comes out
against Trump.

01:52.337 --> 01:54.756
So who are the badasses
doing this?

01:54.810 --> 01:56.835
MORAY: You know, you know what?
L-Let's not find out.

01:56.879 --> 01:58.898
Let's just ask these brahs
to keep it going.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.211
Because that's what
we always said

02:00.255 --> 02:01.821
when we worked
at the Obama White House:

02:02.115 --> 02:04.709
don't get in the way
of someone kicking ass.

at the time of the postnup--

12:12.909 --> 12:14.328
[laughs]:
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:14.612 --> 12:17.804
[Adrian laughing]
I know.

12:17.838 --> 12:21.395
- I know.
- That's a $300 million divorce.[laughing]

12:21.459 --> 12:23.396
500 million.
I googled it.

12:25.145 --> 12:29.245
Okay, so we line up
all the lawyers...

12:29.299 --> 12:32.215
No, no, I... I think
I should do this alone.

12:32.659 --> 12:33.777
Lucca, this is
a really big deal.

12:33.831 --> 12:35.216
I know, and you need
to trust me.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.220
She's skittish.
She wants this private.

12:37.294 --> 12:39.919
Small. And she wants
someone she can trust.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.908
If she didn't talk
on the phone,

12:42.962 --> 12:44.020
how do you know that?

12:45.744 --> 12:46.960
The vibe.

12:49.414 --> 12:51.066
Adrian, trust me.

12:57.730 --> 12:59.152
Jesus Christ.

13:02.557 --> 13:04.380
So you called upstairs
as soon as you found out

13:04.424 --> 13:05.439
it was a Kardashian?

13:05.483 --> 13:06.615
Yes.

13:06.669 --> 13:08.469
And if I'd asked you
not to call upstairs?

13:08.523 --> 13:10.911
I would have agreed,
and then called upstairs.

13:12.355 --> 13:14.643
Hmm. As long as we know
where we stand.

13:17.557 --> 13:18.784
[laughs]

13:23.186 --> 13:25.755
Blum, we need to talk.

13:26.599 --> 13:27.857
Uh, privately.

13:29.301 --> 13:30.737
Hey, kids, fuck off.

13:36.373 --> 13:37.736
Just for a minute.

13:40.713 --> 13:43.431
So, look at all that.

13:43.945 --> 13:46.078
Yeah. How far are we?
[chuckles]

13:46.582 --> 13:49.350
Well, requires more than
a cursory read.

13:50.005 --> 13:51.044
Uh-huh.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.677
Anyway, Roland, I'm gonna
need you to rein it in.

13:55.411 --> 13:57.437
Well, have I been... un-reined?

13:57.871 --> 14:00.803
It's all the personnel, Roland.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.818
Oh. Well, tell me, uh,
how many is too many?

14:05.732 --> 14:06.854
You can have one assistant,

14:06.919 --> 14:07.991
no masseuse

14:08.275 --> 14:09.622
and no outside meetings here.

14:10.226 --> 14:11.705
You can arrange
your meetings somewhere else.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.535
Hmm. No problemo.

14:14.599 --> 14:15.639
[chuckles]
Good.

14:17.930 --> 14:20.487
Vernon was
hoping to meet you

14:20.541 --> 14:22.783
but, uh, another time.

14:23.827 --> 14:24.992
Uh, Vernon?

14:25.546 --> 14:26.852
Jordan, yeah.

14:27.216 --> 14:29.591
Oh, we go way back.
[chuckles]

14:31.532 --> 14:32.583
Uh-huh.

14:43.107 --> 14:44.181
Oh.

14:45.465 --> 14:47.090
He has a meeting today
at 2:00, he can take it

Oh, hey. That's why we don't
share information.

- I didn't share with anyone but Adrian.
- It doesn't matter.

I'm not a snob, it's just
this is a big case.

That's why she needs
someone he doesn't know.

to step out?

- No.
- Yes.

17:05.234 --> 17:06.242
Wait.

17:06.996 --> 17:08.719
They should have
the conversation at least.

17:09.573 --> 17:11.319
She's the only one who answered
the question well.

17:11.634 --> 17:13.868
Are you the one with
the postnup, Zelda?

Hello?

20:00.345 --> 20:01.375
Are you still there?

20:04.009 --> 20:06.127
The new postnup, it says

20:06.171 --> 20:07.844
I must stay married for...

20:08.848 --> 20:11.651
more years,
or I will get nothing.

20:13.385 --> 20:14.503
I see.

20:14.757 --> 20:15.832
How many more years?

20:16.626 --> 20:19.334
I must stay until December 2020.

20:20.839 --> 20:22.119
Okay, 2020.

20:23.474 --> 20:26.543
And you might want a divorce earlier,
is that it? [whispering]

20:26.598 --> 20:27.644
I-I don't know.

20:27.688 --> 20:30.088
I... I want options.

20:30.132 --> 20:31.857
There is a lot of pressure.

20:32.521 --> 20:34.464
And that's why you asked
about unconscionability?

20:34.778 --> 20:36.767
Whether the postnup
can be terminated?

20:36.841 --> 20:40.529
Yes. And there are possible
criminal issues.

20:40.973 --> 20:44.939
I don't want to be in trouble
for.. some things

20:44.993 --> 20:46.099
he did.

20:46.823 --> 20:49.391
Well, without discussing
the exact details

20:49.425 --> 20:51.279
of these criminal "issues,"

20:51.453 --> 20:53.107
a postnup shouldn't impact this.

20:54.021 --> 20:56.616
But he has given me some gifts

20:56.670 --> 20:59.488
where there might be
some questions.

21:03.073 --> 21:05.946
Are these "gifts"
titles to properties? Did he...

21:06.390 --> 21:07.844
transfer them to you?

21:08.438 --> 21:09.867
I don't want to answer that.

21:10.342 --> 21:11.411

document and let her look.

president know that his wife
is consulting a lawyer?

from this conversation.

an effective lawyer

21:46.807 --> 21:49.004

details.

21:49.048 --> 21:50.774
She doesn't trust you fully yet.

21:51.228 --> 21:53.921
Gain her trust
and then we'll talk.

I'm not sure.

in their postnup?

or if this is for real.

22:51.673 --> 22:52.792
What is real?

22:53.716 --> 22:54.780
That was a hairdresser.

22:55.084 --> 22:56.650
And a woman
named Zelda Raye.

22:57.144 --> 22:59.763
And they supposedly
put me on the phone with...

The First Lady.

23:12.515 --> 23:14.039

23:14.413 --> 23:16.386
this is a lot of work
for a prank.

into Zelda Raye?

you're guarding me.

23:43.814 --> 23:45.758
Okay. Leave me now.

23:52.313 --> 23:53.389
Lemond.

23:55.003 --> 23:56.375
Mr. Blum.

23:56.439 --> 23:58.298
- Mister? What'd I do to rate a Mister?
- [Lemond chuckling]

23:58.343 --> 23:59.665
You embarrassed a
district attorney

23:59.729 --> 24:01.195
in the Antonelli trial,
that's what you did.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.106
[both laughing]

24:03.170 --> 24:04.907
I kept that motherfucker
out of prison

24:04.971 --> 24:06.602
four times, he stiffed me
the last two.

24:06.636 --> 24:08.266
I told him, if he ever
called me again,

24:08.330 --> 24:10.354
I would personally
make sure they locked him up

24:10.408 --> 24:12.119
- up under the jail, yeah.
- [laughs] Sounds about right.

24:12.164 --> 24:13.958
You know he was trying to peddle
your ass to the Feds, right?

24:14.012 --> 24:15.019
Oh, I know, I know.

24:15.063 --> 24:17.114
Hey, this is the guy who's
looking out for me right now.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.817
So...
we're here.

24:23.441 --> 24:24.537
It's just the
three of us.

24:25.371 --> 24:26.462
What's so secret?

24:28.266 --> 24:29.356
I asked Jay
to look into

24:29.410 --> 24:31.027
a new client I was
on the phone with.

24:31.071 --> 24:32.618
- Is this still about the Kardashians?
- No.

24:32.992 --> 24:35.107
Lucca was worried
it was a prank, but I did

24:35.171 --> 24:36.702
some research on
the client's conduit.

24:37.386 --> 24:39.643
It's a Wade V--
a New York hairdresser--

24:39.697 --> 24:40.881
and Zelda Raye.

24:41.306 --> 24:43.787
- A conduit? I don't understand.
- The client doesn't want

24:43.831 --> 24:45.893
- to be seen coming into a law firm.
DIANE: Why?

24:46.518 --> 24:48.444
Zelda Ray runs a management
company in New York.

24:49.108 --> 24:50.947
Uh, not one of the big ones.

24:51.001 --> 24:52.312
Oh, so the client
is a model.

24:52.726 --> 24:54.865
She was one.
She is no longer.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.220
Why are you two being so cagey?

24:57.914 --> 24:59.055
[laughs]

24:59.913 --> 25:00.977
[groans]

25:03.111 --> 25:05.267
I think I was put on the phone
with Melania Trump.

25:06.561 --> 25:07.673
[laughs]

25:12.063 --> 25:13.180
ADRIAN:
What...

25:14.544 --> 25:17.105
Are you suggesting
that Melania Trump...

25:17.609 --> 25:20.060
wants to use her manager
from her modeling days?

25:20.225 --> 25:22.022
We're not suggesting anything,
it's just a fact.

25:22.496 --> 25:24.057
Zelda Raye is her ex-manager,

25:24.111 --> 25:26.395
or she was for a few months,
and she was in here.

25:28.363 --> 25:30.638
Why would she use
a hairdresser

25:30.682 --> 25:33.144
and her ex-manager?
I mean, she has a staff.

25:33.348 --> 25:35.781
Her husband told her
she didn't need a lawyer

25:35.825 --> 25:37.974
to review the changes
in their postnup.

25:38.208 --> 25:40.261
Her husband.
Meaning Trump.

25:41.375 --> 25:44.623
I-I don't know. But, if it is Trump,
I think she went outside

25:44.657 --> 25:46.531
his D.C. circle to get
a second opinion.

25:46.775 --> 25:49.661
An opinion from a mid-size
Chicago law firm

25:49.715 --> 25:51.566
with mainly
African-American lawyers?

25:53.881 --> 25:55.689
- Yeah.
- Or we're being set up.

25:56.243 --> 25:57.977
ADRIAN: For?
[exhales]

25:58.151 --> 26:00.897
Uh, what is, um,
what is in this postnup?

26:00.941 --> 26:04.040
She loses all her money
if they divorce before 2020.

26:05.444 --> 26:08.117
[exhales] She wants to divorce
before 2020?

26:08.291 --> 26:09.990
LUCCA: She wants the
freedom to divorce.

26:11.415 --> 26:12.992
Holy fuck.

26:13.166 --> 26:14.299
When do you
speak with her again?

26:14.813 --> 26:17.305
LUCCA: Tomorrow.
- All right. Keep us informed.

26:18.650 --> 26:19.912
Okay.

26:20.086 --> 26:21.391
[clears throat]

26:22.636 --> 26:24.577
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.577
[door closes]

26:37.813 --> 26:39.466
- Does this seem weird to you?
- What?

26:39.540 --> 26:41.623
The fact that we were
talking about Melania Trump

26:41.667 --> 26:43.159
this morning and now she wants to hire us?

26:43.203 --> 26:44.501
Yes.

26:44.545 --> 26:46.993
I mean, the various levels
of weirdness here

26:47.047 --> 26:49.218
are... really hard
to untangle.

26:50.612 --> 26:51.823
So, we're saying...

26:51.887 --> 26:54.408
someone is surveilling
our resistance group?

26:54.462 --> 26:56.306
Book group.
Book group.

26:56.371 --> 26:58.211
And now they want
to dangle some...

26:58.265 --> 27:00.534
irresistible bait
in front of us?

27:00.588 --> 27:02.016
Uh, y-yeah.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.311
To what purpose?

27:04.606 --> 27:05.757
I, I don't know.

27:07.311 --> 27:09.001
But we better
be careful.

27:09.875 --> 27:12.659
Maybe it's...
maybe it's good news.

27:12.704 --> 27:13.966
And we're just
not used to it.

27:14.010 --> 27:15.842
Oh, yeah, how
likely is that?

27:15.897 --> 27:17.223
I don't know,
I'm just,

27:17.267 --> 27:18.842
I'm just so
in the mood for...

27:19.796 --> 27:20.866
looking up.
[phone chimes]

27:20.910 --> 27:21.962
Ooh.

27:23.770 --> 27:25.208
Oh, well,
that ended fast.

27:25.272 --> 27:28.843
- [laughing and chatting]
ADRIAN: Hey, Lemond

27:28.887 --> 27:30.077
Good to see you.

27:30.121 --> 27:31.964
- Sorry to keep you waiting, man.
- Oh, I wasn't waiting.

27:32.238 --> 27:33.274
I was catching up.

27:33.338 --> 27:34.458
DIANE: Uh, you two know each other?

27:34.522 --> 27:37.120
- Mm. From way back.
- Yeah, we used to run into each other

27:37.174 --> 27:40.510
at opium tastings
at the Jewish Community Center.
[chuckles]

27:40.555 --> 27:41.620
Very good.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.996
So I know that, uh,
Lemond wants to talk

27:44.040 --> 27:45.378
some business
with us, Mr. Blum.

27:45.432 --> 27:46.872
So why don't we
just go upstairs?

27:46.916 --> 27:49.072
Oh, actually, I was hoping
Roland could stick around.

27:49.796 --> 27:51.743
Uh, that might cause a problem

27:51.837 --> 27:53.788
if there are any
attorney-client issues.

27:54.192 --> 27:56.095
Oh. I thought
he was working here.

27:56.139 --> 27:58.358
No, he is.
But it's just on the one case,

27:58.422 --> 27:59.696
and it's not criminal, so...

27:59.751 --> 28:01.371
Well, this isn't criminal.

28:02.196 --> 28:03.317
ROLAND: Oh, I have
been known

28:03.381 --> 28:06.211
to blunder onto a good idea
now and then.

28:10.047 --> 28:12.206
You know, you're better off
incorporating in Delaware.

28:12.870 --> 28:14.113
I'd just as soon
not have another state

28:14.167 --> 28:15.513
full of agencies to pay off.

28:15.897 --> 28:17.667
Ah, you do give a
shit load of money

28:17.721 --> 28:19.673
to so-called "good causes."

28:19.727 --> 28:21.826
"So-called" like, uh,
the Johns Hopkins

28:21.890 --> 28:25.026
Malaria Research Institute,
uh, Habitat for Humanity...?

28:25.090 --> 28:28.072
I'm always suspicious when
liberals use the word humanity.

28:28.136 --> 28:30.561
You gave $200,000 to Georgetown?

28:30.615 --> 28:32.858
Yeah, my son has
his heart set on going there.

28:33.282 --> 28:34.400
ADRIAN:
How's it look?

28:35.434 --> 28:36.616
They wait-listed him.

28:36.681 --> 28:39.580
$200,000, and they fucking
wait-listed him?

28:39.614 --> 28:40.705
Are you kidding me?

28:40.779 --> 28:43.055
Apparently, a lot of applicants
give that much more.

28:43.669 --> 28:45.383
So what's the moral
of this story?

28:46.167 --> 28:47.692
200,000 doesn't mean
what it used to?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.411
No, before you put
your hand in your pocket,

28:49.455 --> 28:50.684
you talk to your lawyers.

28:50.758 --> 28:52.020
I mean, correct me
if I'm wrong, Adrian,

28:52.074 --> 28:53.571
but this is a phone
call, is it not?

28:54.605 --> 28:56.793
BISHOP: Getting my son
into Georgetown?

29:00.120 --> 29:03.109
Well, I mean, we can definitely
put our heads together...

29:03.154 --> 29:06.052
ROLAND: They're being modest.
One phone call, and it's done.

29:06.816 --> 29:09.136
[Lemond laughs]

29:09.190 --> 29:11.257
I always said
you needed a hammer.

29:11.861 --> 29:13.259
And there he is.

29:13.783 --> 29:16.995
Your hammer.
[both laugh]

29:17.049 --> 29:19.458
Yep, there he is.

29:21.705 --> 29:23.291
Why would you tell Lemond

29:23.335 --> 29:25.325
that we could get
his son into Georgetown?

29:25.820 --> 29:27.664
Uh, because we can?

29:28.299 --> 29:29.928
What is with this "we" bullshit?

29:30.202 --> 29:31.549
There is no "we" here.

29:31.583 --> 29:33.997
Uh, the "we bullshit,"
dearest Diane,

29:34.051 --> 29:36.804
is a nod
to my very generous nature.

29:37.268 --> 29:38.398
Are you medicated right now?

29:38.432 --> 29:41.326
No. I forget. Look,

29:42.070 --> 29:46.180
even though it'll be me who
calls Father Pat to remind him

29:46.214 --> 29:47.716
who kept his nephew
out of prison,

29:48.010 --> 29:50.417
it'll benefit us.

30:01.755 --> 30:05.066
Hi. I was told to ask for Hannah?

30:05.450 --> 30:06.474
HANNAH: Hi.

30:06.958 --> 30:08.017
Oh.

30:08.442 --> 30:09.645
Hello.

30:10.649 --> 30:12.927
So you're here
to go to the next level?

30:13.511 --> 30:15.669
Well, I'm here to see what
the next level looks like.

30:15.713 --> 30:18.310
Uh, here's the thing about axes:
once you start buying them,

30:18.354 --> 30:19.432
you'll never stop.

30:20.466 --> 30:21.528
Like fine wine.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.456
This is what I suggest.

30:30.966 --> 30:33.526
Oh, well, that's probably
more than I, uh...

30:37.473 --> 30:38.497
Oh, my God.

30:40.781 --> 30:41.929
Those are beautiful.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.524
This is a Morvan Q-P.

30:44.698 --> 30:47.844
Morvan has been making axes
in Prussia since 1646.

30:47.919 --> 30:50.878
They're hand-forged, they've got
a clear tempered zone

30:50.932 --> 30:52.892
that adds to the strength
of the blade.

30:52.937 --> 30:54.311
Go ahead, lift one.

30:55.445 --> 30:58.233
Oh, wow... My.

30:58.407 --> 30:59.844
Whoa, that feels good.

31:02.238 --> 31:04.455
- Oh, my. [laughs softly]
- It's solid steel

31:04.509 --> 31:07.271
with a rubber grip, uh,
to ensure a smooth toss,

31:07.315 --> 31:10.312
and it's got a double-bit head,
allowing you to swap sides

31:10.376 --> 31:11.474
between throws.

31:12.408 --> 31:16.057
- I, um... I want them.
- [doorbell rings]

31:19.121 --> 31:20.168
So, hi.

31:20.612 --> 31:21.958
How did you get
my address?

31:22.013 --> 31:24.861
How do you think?
[phone ringing]

31:28.538 --> 31:29.556
Better answer it.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.680
This is Lucca.

31:37.654 --> 31:38.888
SLOVENIAN WOMAN [over phone]:
Did you look at the contract?

31:39.492 --> 31:40.521
I did.

31:41.195 --> 31:43.728
Uh, it's not good.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.142
He has all the rights,
you have none.

31:47.616 --> 31:49.484
Look, we can talk
about specific language,

31:49.528 --> 31:53.089
but if you were any other
client, I would advise...

31:55.073 --> 31:56.764
you threaten your husband
with divorce.

31:58.408 --> 32:02.111
I know it's a big play,
but, you know, the only reason

32:02.155 --> 32:03.719
he's pushing for this is because

32:03.763 --> 32:05.382
he's the vulnerable one,
not you.

32:06.986 --> 32:10.457
So, you know, threaten him
with divorce, call his bluff,

32:10.511 --> 32:12.224
and you'll get a better deal.

32:16.386 --> 32:17.476
[phone beeps]
Hello?

32:17.720 --> 32:19.528
- I should go.
- No, wait.

32:19.582 --> 32:21.360
There-there's always
a way to fight it.

32:21.534 --> 32:23.930
This was a mistake.
Wait, no, uh...

32:25.524 --> 32:27.399
You're Catholic, right?

32:28.303 --> 32:30.463
Why? Why does that matter?

32:31.587 --> 32:32.726
Annulment.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.191
You threaten annulment.

32:35.635 --> 32:36.940
That wouldn't just void
the marriage,

32:36.984 --> 32:39.334
that would void the prenup, too.

32:39.838 --> 32:42.557
Any non-disclosure agreements
in the original contract,

32:42.621 --> 32:44.217
they-they would cease to exist.

32:45.071 --> 32:47.913
Which means
you could speak freely.

32:49.327 --> 32:50.686
You know,
you could write a book,

32:51.530 --> 32:54.903
hit the talk show circuits,
whatever you want.

32:57.215 --> 32:58.333
I'll call you back.

32:58.397 --> 33:01.229
[line clicks, dial tone sounds]

33:11.678 --> 33:15.003
BURGH: And we're back.
Today, on America Goes Poddy,

33:15.407 --> 33:17.101
you know who we have
on the phone?

33:17.155 --> 33:18.460
MORAY: Who?
BURGH: Melania.

33:18.634 --> 33:20.599
MORAY:
Melania, a-are you there?

33:20.863 --> 33:22.464
MELANIA IMITATOR:
Yes, Bill, I am here.

33:22.638 --> 33:25.133
Oh, do you mind to wait,
so I can get the cheeseburgers

33:25.177 --> 33:27.013
- out of my bed?
BURGH [laughs]: Yeah.

33:27.078 --> 33:28.774
I'm sorry, uh, Mrs. First Lady,

33:28.818 --> 33:31.197
I-I was not aware that you still
slept with each other.

33:31.251 --> 33:33.041
MELANIA IMITATOR:
Oh, yes. He comes into my room

33:33.085 --> 33:34.878
to check on spelling
for his tweets.

33:34.922 --> 33:37.136
PETER: Uh-oh.
"Oh, my God," I say,

33:37.191 --> 33:39.408
"that's not
how you spell 'hamburgers.'"

33:41.572 --> 33:42.643
Is that her?

33:42.907 --> 33:44.834
Who, my Melania? No.

33:45.879 --> 33:48.273
No. No, that's an imitator.

33:48.447 --> 33:50.449
- But does it sound like her?
- Yeah.

33:50.733 --> 33:52.471
But it's a highly
identifiable voice.

33:52.526 --> 33:54.241
People know how to imitate it.

33:54.285 --> 33:56.160
So what's our thinking?
We're being pranked?

33:56.454 --> 34:00.834
I don't know, but, um, that
imitator is Emmylou Roundtree.

34:00.898 --> 34:02.436
She looks like the first lady,

34:02.490 --> 34:05.713
and hires herself out
as a Melania impersonator.

34:05.767 --> 34:08.152
But if it was a prank,
why would they pay our retainer?

34:08.786 --> 34:10.494
$60,000?

34:10.568 --> 34:11.644
I don't know.

34:12.168 --> 34:14.473
But until she's proved
to be a fake,

34:14.536 --> 34:16.011
you've been paid, so
you should represent her.

34:16.725 --> 34:18.690
- Okay.
- But Lucca, if you have any suspicions

34:18.735 --> 34:20.696
that she is a fake,
bring them to us.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.571
There's a chance
that there's a leak.

34:27.005 --> 34:28.443
What do you mean? Why?

34:30.373 --> 34:33.277
The exact same day that
we discussed hacking Melania,

34:33.341 --> 34:36.843
we were approached at our law
firm about a Melania divorce.

34:39.154 --> 34:40.947
- You're kidding.
DIANE: No.

34:41.341 --> 34:43.545
- But we don't think it's real.
POLLY: Why not?

34:43.958 --> 34:47.112
Because we're not a law firm
that you would go to about this.

34:47.666 --> 34:50.170
And we talk to her
on the phone.

34:50.224 --> 34:52.282
It's a voice
easily faked.

34:52.525 --> 34:56.103
Okay. Uh, well, I can
talk to the group

34:56.168 --> 34:58.541
about not telling anyone,

34:58.575 --> 35:00.475
but I don't know
what else to do.

35:00.649 --> 35:02.942
Can you check what
Internet traffic there is?

46:42.464 --> 46:44.482
for the tape in the first place.
She said she's sorry.

46:46.366 --> 46:47.408
Hmm.

46:47.452 --> 46:48.487
One-one more thing.

46:50.966 --> 46:54.193
Okay. She wants to know
if you'd be willing

46:54.227 --> 46:55.299
to meet with her in person.

46:56.823 --> 46:57.964
Are you up
for that?

46:58.028 --> 47:00.318
- Why?
- So she can say all of this face to face,

47:00.352 --> 47:01.560
and you can see
that she means it.

47:02.544 --> 47:03.624
What do you think?

47:04.638 --> 47:07.430
Uh... [sighs]

47:08.824 --> 47:09.892
Penthouse 1

47:09.936 --> 47:11.541
at the Farrow.
7:30 p.m.

47:20.859 --> 47:21.892
[knocking on door]

47:23.516 --> 47:25.908
That work out all right,
breaking it off with the client?

47:26.772 --> 47:28.005
Yeah, perfectly.

47:28.609 --> 47:31.850
Good. If you hear anything
from that client ever again,

47:32.295 --> 47:33.303
you tell us.

47:34.167 --> 47:35.229
I definitely will.

47:35.883 --> 47:36.913
Okay.

47:44.008 --> 47:49.210
[overlapping discussions]

47:49.249 --> 47:52.768
I would argue that
we move Blum off-site.

47:52.943 --> 47:54.923
He hasn't achieved anything
on Second Helix

47:54.988 --> 47:56.410
since he's been here all week.

47:57.284 --> 47:58.901
All he's done is cozy up
to clients,

47:58.955 --> 48:01.054
cavort with associates,
and ruin morale.

48:02.538 --> 48:03.790
Adrian?

48:03.834 --> 48:07.948
Well, he is a different flavor
from what we're used to,

48:07.982 --> 48:11.019
but he has brought in
new business.

48:11.053 --> 48:12.573
Lucrative business.

48:13.197 --> 48:15.860
[stammers] I certainly
didn't want him here,

48:15.924 --> 48:18.700
but... eh... yeah,
it's... something.

48:18.764 --> 48:20.645
Oh, my God. Liz?

48:21.109 --> 48:22.146
I ignore him.

48:22.470 --> 48:24.757
ADRIAN: All right.
Let's put it to a vote.

48:25.781 --> 48:28.879
All those in favor of telling
Roland Blum to leave?

48:46.722 --> 48:48.215
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

48:49.939 --> 48:51.349
Feel free to keep it
to yourself.

48:51.793 --> 48:53.454
I'm a people person.

48:54.308 --> 48:55.369
I am.

48:55.893 --> 48:57.548
You know, I-I-I know

48:58.312 --> 49:01.210
it seems like I wouldn't be,

49:01.264 --> 49:02.598
but deep down,

49:04.142 --> 49:07.073
I just want people to see me
and-and like me.

49:07.147 --> 49:09.434
I-I-I know
it's childish...

49:09.509 --> 49:10.875
Well, you are a child.

49:10.929 --> 49:13.980
...but I'm more sensitive
than I may appear.

49:16.069 --> 49:17.897
Why don't you
like me, Diane?

49:18.741 --> 49:21.031
You know, I-I think you are

49:21.365 --> 49:23.470
an incredible specimen.

49:24.524 --> 49:25.753
You remind me of my mother.

49:25.817 --> 49:27.111
[scoffs]

49:28.223 --> 49:32.172
We could be great together.
Professionally, of course.

49:32.756 --> 49:34.762
Though, I'll warn you,
you may find yourself

49:34.826 --> 49:36.108
eventually
falling for me.

49:36.162 --> 49:38.081
My pheromones are merciless.

49:38.135 --> 49:39.316
I know what this is.

49:40.310 --> 49:41.840
You've managed
to sink your fangs

49:41.884 --> 49:44.665
into most of my colleagues
and that gives you a high

49:44.729 --> 49:46.457
because you're a desecrationist.

49:46.521 --> 49:48.233
I've never been
called that before.

49:48.827 --> 49:50.193
My pants just got
a little tight.

49:50.247 --> 49:52.018
You're compelled to defile,
Mr. Blum.

49:52.292 --> 49:53.575
It's pathological.

49:54.589 --> 49:56.968
And you may think you've made
some inroads at my firm,

49:57.012 --> 49:58.787
but I guarantee you,
it's not gonna last.

49:58.851 --> 50:02.302
Because you are the light
that drives out the darkness?

50:02.376 --> 50:04.699
No, because your tactics work,

50:05.843 --> 50:07.490
and I'm happy to become you...

50:09.540 --> 50:11.584
...in order to get you
the fuck out of my way.

50:24.352 --> 50:25.984
[door lock beeps]

50:30.410 --> 50:31.421
Hello?

50:31.885 --> 50:32.925
[door closes]

50:58.726 --> 51:01.015
Hi. I was told,

51:01.079 --> 51:02.214
um, to...

51:25.883 --> 51:28.035
Do you want me to...

51:39.572 --> 51:41.041
[door opens]

51:42.875 --> 51:48.702
[footsteps approaching]

51:56.415 --> 51:59.598
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

52:05.984 --> 52:09.585
Do you want wine?
I'm going to have some.

52:09.639 --> 52:11.855
I'm a little bit
nervous. [chuckles]

52:11.909 --> 52:13.108
Sure.

52:32.028 --> 52:33.266
I didn't know you were black.

52:35.960 --> 52:37.227
I-I am.

52:38.981 --> 52:39.998
You're pretty.

52:41.533 --> 52:42.631
Thank you?

52:43.975 --> 52:45.231
Do you have
any tattoos?

52:46.416 --> 52:48.618
[chuckles] No.

52:51.836 --> 52:52.923
I have two.

52:54.567 --> 52:55.575
Oh?

52:56.059 --> 52:57.658
My husband doesn't like them.

53:00.412 --> 53:01.428
I see.

53:02.722 --> 53:04.563
Have you changed
your mind about divorce?

53:06.098 --> 53:07.518
[sighs]

53:08.442 --> 53:09.520
I have.

53:11.194 --> 53:12.218
Why?

53:13.412 --> 53:15.008
Because of Jackie Kennedy.

53:17.222 --> 53:18.814
We're very connected,
you know.

53:19.378 --> 53:21.573
I am the second
Catholic First Lady,

53:22.307 --> 53:24.506
so now it is up to me
to carry the torch.

53:26.650 --> 53:28.693
I think so hard

53:29.847 --> 53:30.986
what she would do?

53:32.320 --> 53:33.664
What did she do?

53:35.688 --> 53:37.121
She knew about those women,

53:38.685 --> 53:42.265
but she also understood
the man that she married,

53:42.669 --> 53:45.239
as I understand
the man I married.

53:46.753 --> 53:49.495
She put on her lipstick
and she turned the other cheek.

53:50.670 --> 53:51.780
She gave support.

53:53.214 --> 53:54.714
And she found
some happiness.

53:57.128 --> 53:58.337
That is what I will do, too.

54:01.001 --> 54:02.173
Are you sure?

54:03.787 --> 54:05.640
You don't need
to be subservient.

54:07.084 --> 54:09.090
It is my duty
to the American people

54:09.144 --> 54:10.333
to see this through.

54:11.757 --> 54:13.364
I must be best too, no?

54:15.338 --> 54:16.369
And my husband,

54:16.403 --> 54:18.279
he buys me this
for me yesterday.

54:19.823 --> 54:20.890
It's beautiful, no?

54:26.310 --> 54:27.493
I have to go.

54:27.547 --> 54:29.354
You don't need to do
what people tell you.

54:31.389 --> 54:33.081
It was very nice to meet you.

54:35.723 --> 54:36.949
I like black people.

54:39.265 --> 54:40.756
If you change your mind...

54:41.520 --> 54:42.584
Um...

54:54.335 --> 54:57.584
There is one thing that might
make me change my mind.

54:59.168 --> 55:00.174
What?

55:02.919 --> 55:04.845
If you do have
that pee-pee tape,

55:05.719 --> 55:08.378
I could use that to help
fight against my husband.

55:11.616 --> 55:12.810
You're a faker,

55:14.854 --> 55:15.968
aren't you?
