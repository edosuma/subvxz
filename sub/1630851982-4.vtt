[Jane] Going in the elevator.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.144
Going to the fifth floor.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.898
Gonna have my surgery.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.025
I just said goodbye
to my parents.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.027
I don't know why
I'm not emotional.

Little thing.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.964

00:49.508 --> 00:53.888
And so my doctors
just came in,

00:53.929 --> 00:58.851
and it's official that I'm
having my surgery at 11:00.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.979
And it's 10:27.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.522
It's crazy.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.857
I'm really excited.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.589
Ow.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.384

What a relief.

- Stress.
- Yeah.

Stress.

I'm in a supermarket,
shopping,

while my daughter's
having surgery.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.483
- I know.
- It's like...

03:11.525 --> 03:14.570
And it's the only thing to do
because you just try to keep...

03:14.612 --> 03:16.906
you know, to keep your
mind off of it

03:16.947 --> 03:18.949
and keep busy.

Hold on.

her?

- No, just Mom.
- Just Mom?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.756
Well, one of us.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.758
Can we come in on Saturday?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.927
- Just one.
- I'll ask.

visiting her in the hospital

07:43.338 --> 07:45.966
after surgery, and...

07:46.008 --> 07:48.010
I went through great trouble,

07:48.051 --> 07:51.972
uh, to pick her up
something fun.

07:52.014 --> 07:55.058
But I'm not allowed
to take 'em upstairs.

I missed you.

Right?

09:25.399 --> 09:26.942
What shall we call her?

09:26.984 --> 09:29.403
I thought we were calling her
Patricia. [laughs]

09:29.444 --> 09:31.905
Does she look like
a Patricia?

09:31.947 --> 09:34.866
- How do you feel?
- I feel really happy.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.411
I'm kinda tired.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.621

[David] Sit in the front
or the back, honey?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.591
The front?

Seven weeks post-op.

10:26.460 --> 10:32.591
I really wasn't prepared
for how painful

10:32.632 --> 10:33.800
all that was gonna be.

10:33.842 --> 10:37.888
Two months post-op.

Do you ever just get
sand in your gooch.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.131
It's good exfoliant.

11:16.093 --> 11:19.346
You just gotta worry
about camel toe.

11:19.388 --> 11:23.600
Today is February 17th.

11:23.642 --> 11:28.021
I am officially
eight months post-op.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.524
And...yeah.

11:30.565 --> 11:34.403
I got a job and...

11:34.444 --> 11:39.324
That's what I've been doing
pretty much so far as of 2021.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.039
We're just gonna wing it.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.007
I was at college.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.176
All my friends are at college.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.850
I just feel very...
I guess lost right now,

12:04.891 --> 12:07.561
but the goal at the beginning,

12:07.602 --> 12:10.397
of the gap year,

12:10.439 --> 12:14.109
was to just focus on recovering
from my surgery.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.654
And now that I'm pretty much
almost recovered,

12:17.696 --> 12:20.323
I really gotta start
thinking about

12:20.365 --> 12:22.742
what I really want.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.744
I did a photo shoot.

12:24.786 --> 12:29.791
It was with this French
photographer named Matthew.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.002
And it was a lot of
funny-fun.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.339
Oh.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.925
I don't know. I'm just having,
I guess, this moment

12:38.967 --> 12:40.969
where I'm not sure if film

12:41.011 --> 12:43.138
is what I'm really
passionate about.

12:43.180 --> 12:46.099
I'm not sure if I even want
to go to school right now.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.522
[Emma] From what she told me,
she didn't want to go to SVA.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.858
I looked at her and I was like,
"What are you gonna do?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.027
Stay in Sparta?"

13:00.197 --> 13:03.575
Isn't in interesting
that three-four years ago,

13:03.617 --> 13:07.704
we were running around
out in this field?

13:07.746 --> 13:09.706
Getting screamed at.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.459
You come in
as a freshman and...

13:12.501 --> 13:14.127
- Not knowing anything.
- Not knowing anything.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.922
I think that when you're
here at the Academy,

13:16.963 --> 13:18.548
you're a mentor
no matter what.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.759
You're thrown into all these
leadership positions,

13:20.800 --> 13:23.053
and it forces you to mature

13:23.094 --> 13:26.389
and grow up and make,
you know, sound decisions,

13:26.431 --> 13:28.099
essentially.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.143
But I think that
I'll always be,

13:30.185 --> 13:31.770
like, the big sister role.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.605
I think...

13:33.647 --> 13:36.358
I mean, that's how I've
always been, you know?

13:38.443 --> 13:41.947
Sometimes Jane needs
a little push.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.157
I needed a push.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.243
It was certainly hard
for me to come here.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.371
I was horrified.
I was so scared.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.872
But now I'm here,

13:50.914 --> 13:53.500
and I've met so many
wonderful people.

13:53.542 --> 13:57.921
You know? So I want her to
have the courage

13:57.963 --> 14:00.674
and the strength
to just say "Okay, yes.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.343
Yes, let's do it.
Let's do it. Let's do it."

14:03.385 --> 14:06.846
The total opposite of what
she was saying

14:06.888 --> 14:08.807
when we were younger.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.433
"No, I don't wanna go out.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.852
No, I don't wanna do this.
No, I wanna stay here.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.021
No, I don't wanna go
see people."

14:15.063 --> 14:17.440
I want it to be the complete
opposite for her.

14:17.482 --> 14:21.361
[Emma] At least try.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.655
Do you think I should
go to SVA?

14:23.697 --> 14:26.866
You think I should go?

14:26.908 --> 14:31.705
[Jane] I was so focused on
getting my surgery,

14:31.746 --> 14:35.584
I didn't really have time
to think about next steps.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.419
I definitely want to keep
doing modeling

14:37.460 --> 14:41.006
and maybe start taking
acting classes maybe?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.549
I don't know.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.971
We're getting our
vaccine shot today.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.472
Hello.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.100
Are you ready
to get poked?

14:52.142 --> 14:54.603
Where?
[laughs]

14:54.644 --> 14:56.605
Where's that happening?

14:56.646 --> 14:57.814
In your Covid hole?

14:57.856 --> 15:00.108
[laughs]

15:00.150 --> 15:02.027
My Covid hole?

15:02.068 --> 15:04.946
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, honey. How are you?

15:04.988 --> 15:07.657
Good. How are you?

15:07.699 --> 15:09.326
The whole world is getting
their shot.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.621
You don't need it?

15:12.662 --> 15:14.664
[Jane] Why won't you
get your shot?

15:14.706 --> 15:15.915
Huh?

15:15.957 --> 15:17.292
Why won't you
get your shot?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.044
I don't need it.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.629
[Jane chuckles]

15:22.297 --> 15:27.719
[Laura] That's where
we grew up.

15:27.761 --> 15:31.556
It's where Mommy and Daddy
fell in love.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.266
[Jane] That's where
you fell in love?

15:33.308 --> 15:36.186
[Laura] Yeah, not on this
highway.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.937
[Jane] Did you guys
make out?

15:37.979 --> 15:40.106
I said "That's where I used to
make out with your daddy."

15:40.148 --> 15:42.484
I said, "Oh, wait,
that wasn't him."

15:42.525 --> 15:43.985
[laughs]

15:44.027 --> 15:46.404
How do you guys feel after
getting your shot?

15:47.697 --> 15:49.616
Ooh, it's tender.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.076
[laughs]
Oh, my God!

15:51.117 --> 15:52.869
Do you already feel congested?

15:52.911 --> 15:54.579
Yeah, I do.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.415
And I'm constipated and I have
diarrhea at the same time.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.709
[all laugh]

16:05.548 --> 16:08.009
I'm gonna be 20 soon.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.345
Just crazy.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.597
I'm not gonna be
a teenager anymore.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.519
Do you remember when we were in
elementary school,

16:17.560 --> 16:19.813
and you fell on your face?

16:19.854 --> 16:21.272
We were on the swings
together.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.857
Stop.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.235
You remember the first time
we dressed up together?

16:25.276 --> 16:27.570
It was probably the dance.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.239
No, it was, like, Halloween.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.574
'Cause that was the first time I
started wearing makeup.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.743
That was before I was out.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.787
[both laugh]

16:38.832 --> 16:40.875
I really don't want to
be an adult.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.254
Yeah, I know,
it's, like, scary.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.755
Responsibilities.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.549
Like, how are we
in college?

16:47.590 --> 16:48.967
Well, I'm not.
[laughs]

16:59.185 --> 17:00.937
[doorbell rings]

17:00.979 --> 17:03.231
Hello?

17:03.273 --> 17:05.859
- Hey!
- Hey!

17:05.900 --> 17:08.445
- Good to see you.
- So good to see you.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.654
- Been so long.
- I know.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.448
This is great.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.992
This is, like, the most
impressive thing ever.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.078
I'm gonna put that is the most
impressive thing you've made.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.039
- [glasses clinking]
- Great to see you guys.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.791
- Missed you so much.
- Love you. Missed you.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.460
We were at Sparta Dairy,

17:23.501 --> 17:26.713
and we were reminiscing
about football.

17:26.755 --> 17:29.716
Remember the practices we'd
go to on Saturday morning?

17:29.758 --> 17:32.677
And we'd sit there with
all the other dads going,

17:32.719 --> 17:35.138
"My boy! My boy!
That's my boy!"

17:35.180 --> 17:38.141
And our boys would be
disco dancing. Ooh! Ooh!

17:38.183 --> 17:41.811
We'd look at each other like...

17:41.853 --> 17:43.396
You said one time,

17:43.438 --> 17:46.608
"I think maybe someday
our boys are gonna date."

17:46.649 --> 17:49.194
I know it.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.446
Patrick came out
as a freshman?

17:51.488 --> 17:54.699
He was a sophomore,
so he was 15.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.701
I mean, you know,
when we grew up,

17:56.743 --> 17:57.869
it was just
a different world.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.412
It was a different world.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.622
And so you're worrying about
your kid's safety

18:00.663 --> 18:02.540
and acceptance.

18:02.582 --> 18:07.504
The only time I ever
felt, um, sneered upon

18:07.545 --> 18:09.047
was at the post office.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.090
The picture? Is that what--
For the passport?

18:11.132 --> 18:13.676
Yeah, we're getting
a passport.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.637
And we filled out the
application and whatnot,

18:15.678 --> 18:16.971
and she's like...

18:17.013 --> 18:20.183
and it says on
the application,

18:20.225 --> 18:22.268
"Did you ever have
a different name?"

18:22.310 --> 18:25.104
So I had to write down,
"Her name is Jane Lola,

18:25.146 --> 18:27.482
but she was Jack Noury
at one point."

18:27.524 --> 18:31.194
And she goes,
"Wait a minute."

18:31.236 --> 18:34.322
She goes...
and then she goes...

18:34.364 --> 18:35.782
She made
that face.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.951
- She made that face.
- Yeah, I was there too.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.328
And Jane is right there.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.705
Oh, really.

18:42.747 --> 18:46.125
And I wanted to take her head
and go bam, bam, bam,

18:46.167 --> 18:47.460
right on the table.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.337
And I'm like,
"Is there an issue?"

18:49.379 --> 18:52.882
And then... It was just
like this quick...

18:52.924 --> 18:56.469
It was a disgusting,
quick exchange

18:56.511 --> 18:58.012
that I wanted to fucking
kill somebody.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.722
You're gonna have
that shit,

18:59.764 --> 19:01.349
and you're gonna have people
that are compassionate,

19:01.391 --> 19:03.935
and that's the difference.
There's people who...

19:03.977 --> 19:05.353
But you're never
prepared for this.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.188
There's a bunch of
shitheads out there.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.898
I think we just have to teach
our kids not to be naïve.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.733
- Well, they need to
have open eyes.
- Yeah.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.403
They can't be naive.
They can never be naive.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.029
They always have to be, um...

19:15.071 --> 19:16.364
- Alert.
- On task.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.866
Exactly.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.285
Which is a sad way
to have to be.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.997
You know, she should just
be Jane.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.666
College and learning
cool shit.

19:26.708 --> 19:30.587
To be creative
and be artistic.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.631
[Jane]
Rupert, guess what.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.926
Rupert, Meatball...

19:36.968 --> 19:39.012
I'm in a magazine.

19:39.053 --> 19:41.222
I know, right?
It's crazy.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.932
I didn't know either.

19:44.475 --> 19:47.729
Oh, my God! You're in
your first magazine!

19:47.770 --> 19:48.938
And we didn't even know.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.232
Love your real eyelashes.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.318
- Those aren't real.
- I know, I'm joking.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.695
Holy mackerel.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.530
That's phenomenal!

19:57.572 --> 19:59.616
Janey...

19:59.657 --> 20:01.159
We just bought it.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.331
So I just found out
I'm gonna be doing

20:06.372 --> 20:09.417
a photo shoot with Stef again.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.835
I can't wait to see her.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.587
We're gonna see
each other again.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.380
I'm really excited to get out of
the house and do something.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.383
Honestly, it has been
really boring.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.136
I'm gonna look so good.
Heeyy.

20:23.139 --> 20:28.978
[music playing]

20:29.020 --> 20:30.730
How have you been feeling?

20:30.772 --> 20:32.190
My surgery? I mean, yeah.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.400
Everything was rough.
Like, the first...

20:34.442 --> 20:37.362
And you were all alone.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.072
For a couple days, yeah.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.990
[music playing]

21:04.847 --> 21:07.976
Are you gonna try to, like,
balance college and modeling?

21:08.017 --> 21:10.979
Or do you wanna be
a filmmaker or...

21:11.020 --> 21:14.899
Um, I wouldn't say I have
like... It has been a passion.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.151
I mean, I do wanna keep
on modeling, I think.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.238
I have a lot of things that I'm
interested in and I want to tap
into that.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.906
That's good.
Having a wheel house

21:21.948 --> 21:24.325
of different artistic
endeavors, like...

21:24.367 --> 21:26.035
And I don't think I wanna do
just one thing.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.662
I think I wanna do
a couple things.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.206
I think, for me, acting
has always been something

21:30.248 --> 21:31.958
too... that I've love.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.460
Because I can kind of play
a different role.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.837
'Cause that's the thing.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.673
It's like I was pretending
to be a boy.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.300
People don't say
"I was acting like a boy"

21:41.342 --> 21:43.136
in public spaces
to appease my family.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.095
Yeah.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.263
And having to pretend
to be someone else,

21:45.304 --> 21:47.265
that's gonna fuck
with your head.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.809
And I feel like I've only
recently

21:49.851 --> 21:53.896
gotten to a point where
I stopped caring so much.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.773
Where I'm just kinda, like,
I don't really give a fuck

21:55.815 --> 21:59.569
if I'm in public
and someone questions, like,

21:59.610 --> 22:00.987
"Oh, that's a really
tall girl."

22:01.029 --> 22:03.072
Or "Oh, her chest
is so flat."

22:03.114 --> 22:06.284
There's nothing wrong with
how your body looks.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.871
And if you wanna change that,
to make you happy, then do it.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.414
I think that's the most
important thing,

22:11.456 --> 22:13.416
at the end of the day is,

22:13.458 --> 22:15.376
as long as you're doing it
for yourself,

22:15.418 --> 22:17.420
that's all that matters.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.757
[birds chirping]

22:28.765 --> 22:32.101
It's an Alfalfa-fuck-you
hairstyle.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.524
You like my hair?

22:38.566 --> 22:41.819
Yeah, it's very 1980s.

22:41.861 --> 22:45.448
It's a little...
middle finger, or Alfalfa

22:45.490 --> 22:46.532
Is that what that is?

22:46.574 --> 22:47.909
That's what it looks like.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.911
- Love you. Have a good day.
- You too.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.413
Ah! Did you call SVA?

22:52.455 --> 22:54.499
- Call them?
- Did you write them?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.793
- I'm going to.
- Are you?

22:56.834 --> 22:59.003
- No.
- Did you write back?

22:59.045 --> 23:01.380
I said I got it.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.716
I filled out the form.
Did you fill out the form?

23:03.758 --> 23:06.052
No, I passed out.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.638
Well, good thing you're
awake now.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.765
Well, I...
Okay.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.184
I'll do it while
I'm eating.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.269
It's gonna take
longer than that.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.938
I'll do my best.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.940
I did mine.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.191
All right.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.699
Jane was getting
mired down a little bit,

23:28.741 --> 23:30.368
after high school,
after surgery.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.954
In that gap year, there were
also was some

23:32.995 --> 23:34.997
sort of change of mind.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.416
We just, we said,
you know...

23:37.458 --> 23:39.001
Just move forward.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.754
You can't go anywhere
if you're just

23:41.796 --> 23:44.048
sitting at home
doing nothing.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.633
You have to take...

23:45.675 --> 23:47.051
even if they're
the wrong steps,

23:47.093 --> 23:49.178
just take steps,
you know,

23:49.220 --> 23:50.263
and you'll figure it out.

23:50.304 --> 23:54.183
So what'd you do
today, Dad?

23:54.225 --> 23:55.977
There's a good ball game
on tonight.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.478
Who's playing?

23:57.520 --> 24:00.356
Mets playing Baltimore.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.984
Baltimore's playing
in New York.

24:03.025 --> 24:06.195
Emma is in Seattle right now.

24:06.237 --> 24:09.824
She doesn't like that we track
her, Daddy, on Find Friends.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.951
- He stalks.
- I stalk.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.829
I knew when she was in Belgium,
when she was in England,

24:14.871 --> 24:16.205
France, Germany.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.541
I feel like one day
I'm gonna wake up

24:18.583 --> 24:20.042
with a tracker
in my arm.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.336
Like, just a big bump.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.963
That's, like, beeping red.

24:24.005 --> 24:27.925
As the technology evolves,
I'll look into it.

24:27.967 --> 24:32.346
She's a very heavy sleeper,
so it's very feasible.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.641
I could be anywhere
in the world,

24:35.683 --> 24:39.729
and they will text me, "What are
you doing in this state?"

24:39.770 --> 24:41.772
I'm like, "How did you
even know I was here?"

24:41.814 --> 24:43.065
And they would be like,

24:43.107 --> 24:45.067
"We were just looking at
where you were."

24:45.109 --> 24:47.945
They're with me all the time.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.865
Aw.
It's funny.

24:50.907 --> 24:54.368
Freshman year, I joined
the Spectrum Affinity Council,

24:54.410 --> 24:57.455
and it's a support system
for people who

24:57.496 --> 24:59.874
maybe do not have
a supportive family,

24:59.916 --> 25:01.375
supportive background.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.420
This community supports,
loves, cares

25:04.462 --> 25:06.672
and respects them for who
they are as a person.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.591
I think, especially when
we go out into the fleet,

25:08.633 --> 25:11.928
I think they'll be an even
bigger group of individuals

25:11.969 --> 25:15.348
who need to be supported
and need guidance.

25:15.389 --> 25:19.185
And I think someone
like you and myself

25:19.227 --> 25:21.938
and our friends will be
there to support them.

25:24.649 --> 25:28.152
I'm gonna be an officer in
the United States Coast Guard.

25:28.194 --> 25:32.073
My job is gonna be
helping people.

25:32.114 --> 25:35.368
My main goal is to do things
for others.

25:35.409 --> 25:38.996
I hope the world becomes
more accepting

25:39.038 --> 25:40.498
and continues to become
more accepting, and

25:40.539 --> 25:45.419
not just for transgender
individuals but everyone.

25:45.461 --> 25:49.382
I will never understand
how Jane's transition,

25:49.423 --> 25:51.717
or any other person's
transition,

25:51.759 --> 25:53.219
still bothers people.

25:53.261 --> 25:57.598
It doesn't affect them,
so why does it matter?

25:57.640 --> 26:02.561
And sometimes you wonder how
Jane is gonna get through that.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.356
But at the same time,
I'm still not scared that

26:05.398 --> 26:07.608
she can't get through it.

26:07.650 --> 26:12.363
If anything, Jane is
more of a beautiful person

26:12.405 --> 26:14.657
every day because
she is herself.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.289
- Jidu.
- What?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.541
- I wanna ask you.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.962
The old-timers, would they be
accepting of Jane?

26:28.004 --> 26:30.089
- Not the old-fashioned
ones, no.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.550
- How would she have
been treated?

26:32.591 --> 26:35.511
- They would shun her.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.847
Keep away from her.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.181
- Would they hurt her?

26:39.223 --> 26:41.642
- No, they would never hurt.

26:41.684 --> 26:45.980
But just actions can
hurt you, you know.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.732
- Yeah.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.318
- But my mother and father were
very broad-minded people.

26:50.359 --> 26:53.612
Very, very broad-minded
people.

26:53.654 --> 26:57.366
Which is great.
That's the way it should be.

26:57.408 --> 26:59.702
That's the way it should be.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.747
It's your life, and you know
what you want in life.

27:02.788 --> 27:07.084
If that's what you want in life
and you're happy with it, fine.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.879
Do it.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.340
That's what my mother
used to tell me.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.050
Don't let anything
hold you back.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.926
If you wanna do something,
do it.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.262
Don't let anybody
change your mind.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.765
And she was right.
And I did.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.641
[music playing]

27:31.108 --> 27:32.401
Wow.

27:32.443 --> 27:33.778
So this is it?

27:33.819 --> 27:36.405
It's SVA. We're just gonna
look around.

27:36.447 --> 27:38.866
We're gonna see some of the
dorms, some of the classes.

27:38.908 --> 27:43.287
They're gonna tell me a little
more about the school.

27:43.329 --> 27:47.416
[Faith] Jane opened up to me
about SVA.

27:47.458 --> 27:51.587
She has a few things, like,
going around in her head.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.589
Like, she's still thinking
about it.

27:53.631 --> 27:55.091
Are you excited?
Like, are you ready?

27:55.132 --> 27:57.593
I am. I 'm not ready,
but I'm excited.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.804
She's, like, totally nervous
to live in the city,

27:59.845 --> 28:02.181
but she's very, like,
independent,

28:02.223 --> 28:03.349
she knows what she's doing.

28:03.391 --> 28:05.226
So I think she'll be fine.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.312
Closet.
I used to be in there.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.022
How was it in there?

28:10.064 --> 28:12.274
Depressing.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.110
[Man] Hello. Jane? Hi.
- Hi.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.278
So you like cinematography,
right? That's your focus?

28:16.320 --> 28:17.571
Interested in photography?

28:17.613 --> 28:19.824
- Yeah.
- So this is for you.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.700
So we have plenty of lights.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.661
We got our sound packages here.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.830
We kinda cover it all.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.375
We really have a lot of great
gear to work with here.

28:29.417 --> 28:32.253
If you guys wanna take a minute
and look at the space.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.838
I'll give you guys
a minute, okay?

28:33.879 --> 28:35.256
[Jane]
Thank you.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.802
They have much better bags
than we do.

28:39.844 --> 28:42.138
Like, 50, my God.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.598
No, and they're, like,
not ripped.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.351
Did you know my mom
wanted to come here?

28:47.393 --> 28:48.644
Really?

28:48.686 --> 28:50.187
She wanted to come
for art,

28:50.229 --> 28:52.231
and she's really good
at drawing, so...

28:52.273 --> 28:53.732
- Oh.
- But...

28:53.774 --> 28:55.276
they couldn't afford it.
She got in, though.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.529
This was, like,
her dream school.

28:58.571 --> 29:03.451
You will be encouraged
to communicate

29:03.492 --> 29:05.953
with everything in you.

29:05.995 --> 29:09.540
An art education is really
an education in yourself.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.378
There's so many stories
that haven't been told.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.423
You just tell your story
your way.

29:17.465 --> 29:19.049
Unapologetically.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.261
If you're a cinematographer,
it's not about the lens

29:22.303 --> 29:24.513
as much as about
understanding...

29:24.555 --> 29:26.515
what's the heart of the story?

29:26.557 --> 29:29.727
Why did you use that lens?
What's the meaning?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.771
What is it that makes us
wanna see a Jane film?

29:32.813 --> 29:35.232
Yeah.

29:35.274 --> 29:39.612
And we'll push you to...
tell stories.

29:43.741 --> 29:46.535
So, I've made up my mind.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.120
Finally.

29:48.162 --> 29:50.289
I'm gonna go to SVA.

29:50.331 --> 29:51.624
Yay!

29:51.665 --> 29:53.626
Anyway...

29:53.667 --> 29:55.544
Yeah, I'm happy
I made a decision.

29:55.586 --> 29:58.047
I think I made
the right decision for me.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.132
I'm just excited that
I finally

30:00.174 --> 30:01.842
don't have to think about it
anymore, honestly.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.636
Like...

30:03.677 --> 30:05.346
don't have to worry about that.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.223
And if it doesn't work out,
it doesn't work out.

30:07.264 --> 30:10.935
Can't really... predict
anything, but...

30:10.976 --> 30:14.021
we're going in with
high hopes.

30:14.063 --> 30:16.690
That's me growing up, I guess,

30:16.732 --> 30:20.402
and learning that I'm allowed
to make my own choices

30:20.444 --> 30:23.822
and decide how I want
my life to go.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.328
That's my grandma.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.705
That's her graduation photo.
My mom gave it to me.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.499
Look how beautiful she is.

30:33.541 --> 30:36.001
She looks so pretty.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.879
Hey, Tayta.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.965
Hi.

30:41.006 --> 30:44.051
Okay, so I am officially...

30:47.137 --> 30:48.681
going to college.

30:48.722 --> 30:52.309
I'm officially registered
for my first year.

30:52.351 --> 30:56.814
And because I took a gap year,
I will be graduating in 2025.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.025
[smartphone beeps]

31:00.067 --> 31:03.028
How old will be in 2025?

31:03.070 --> 31:04.446
[smartphone beeps]

31:04.488 --> 31:06.615
-<i> You will be 23.</i>
<i>-</i> [gasps]

31:08.492 --> 31:10.744
No, I won't.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.289
-<i> I'm sorry. I can't...</i>
<i>-</i> Shut up!

31:13.330 --> 31:17.626
I'm gonna be in the city next
year, all by myself.

31:23.716 --> 31:26.927
[both laugh]

31:26.969 --> 31:29.013
Go do your chores.

31:36.729 --> 31:40.691
[Jane] How do feel about me
leaving for college? Collage?

31:40.733 --> 31:44.820
[Mae] Um, I mean, I'm proud of
you.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.530
Thanks.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.074
Like, gonna be depressed.

31:49.116 --> 31:52.244
Mm. Ow!
I just hit my shin!

31:53.871 --> 31:56.165
Like, I want you to go
and do things.

31:56.206 --> 31:59.752
Like, that's
so great for you.

31:59.793 --> 32:02.880
Thanks.
You sound so sincere.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.175
I don't know. I don't want
to think about it.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.801
[water running]

32:07.843 --> 32:10.888
You're gonna go off to college
in two years, though.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.515
Yeah, but like...

32:13.557 --> 32:17.186
After that, we're not gonna
see each other that much.

32:17.227 --> 32:20.522
That's not guaranteed.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.983
But, like, it's implied.

32:23.025 --> 32:27.279
[laughs]
From who? From me?

32:27.321 --> 32:29.698
We don't see Emma
that much anymore.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.909
She's in the military.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.328
Still, we wouldn't see her
that much anyway.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.830
Yeah, she's what, 23 now?

32:39.375 --> 32:42.086
So when you go off
to college,

32:42.127 --> 32:45.130
it's gonna be like...
how Emma is now.

32:45.172 --> 32:47.174
Emma's going out
and doing things.

32:47.216 --> 32:49.802
Like, yay, good for her.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.595
For love, for her.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.389
Well, you gotta call her more.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.766
I hate calling people.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.434
It's your sister.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.854
I'm not gonna call you.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.189
You're not gonna call me?

33:02.231 --> 33:04.400
I mean, I'll try.
But then, like...

33:04.441 --> 33:07.236
Then why are you gonna be sad
if you don't even try?

33:07.277 --> 33:10.572
You know, it's not like every
day you have to call me.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.241
I'm not gonna call you
every day.

33:12.282 --> 33:14.910
I know you're not, but we can
check in on each other.

33:14.952 --> 33:16.412
But, like,
you're gonna be busy.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.497
We don't even call now.
We don't text.

33:18.539 --> 33:20.290
'Cause we live together.

33:20.332 --> 33:24.002
But, like, when you go out
and stuff, like, we don't text.

33:24.044 --> 33:27.798
We just send each other TikToks
on Snapchat and that's it.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.008
O-kay.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.595
I don't know.

33:33.637 --> 33:34.972
I think we'll be fine.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.306
I think you're a little
dramatic.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.559
Well, you'll be doing
your own thing,

33:38.600 --> 33:40.602
and I'll be doing
my own thing.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.938
It's like the end of an era.

33:42.980 --> 33:46.150
I mean, yeah. We're not gonna
be here forever, though.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.694
I'm aware of that.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.322
It's like when she's home,

33:52.364 --> 33:55.826
we're all in our
safe little bubble.

33:55.868 --> 33:59.913
And she's going to...
the city, which is great.

33:59.955 --> 34:02.124
Because there's so many
different kinds of people

34:02.166 --> 34:04.626
in the city, and I know that
she'll be accepted

34:04.668 --> 34:06.879
and embraced and loved.

34:06.920 --> 34:10.924
But it's still dangerous,
and it's still scary.

34:10.966 --> 34:14.219
And it's not safe,
and it's not home.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.140
Go ahead.

34:18.182 --> 34:21.393
Like, you guys are great,
but you guys aren't Jane.

34:21.435 --> 34:23.061
No, we're not.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.688
I'm gonna have to get used
to all the noise

34:24.730 --> 34:29.193
and all the crazy people
that pass by or whatever.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.403
But it's exciting, though.

34:31.445 --> 34:33.614
Yeah, we're more
excited for you,

34:33.655 --> 34:35.991
you know, and we're
always here for you,

34:36.033 --> 34:38.452
and we'll be there in
a second if you need us.

34:38.494 --> 34:41.622
I'm gonna cry,
so stop.

34:41.663 --> 34:46.168
It's gonna be hard to say...
you know, to let you go.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.505
But I'm excited to see
where you go.

34:49.546 --> 34:51.256
I mean, look at Emma.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.634
You know, we went through
the same things with Emma.

34:53.675 --> 34:56.178
And we're gonna go though
the same things with Mae-Mae.

34:56.220 --> 34:59.473
You know? And it is.
It's painful.

34:59.515 --> 35:04.436
It's painful to...
for change.

35:04.478 --> 35:07.356
And we're also confident
that, you know,

35:07.397 --> 35:11.318
you know how to deal
with the issues.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.196
I mean, I feel like...

35:14.238 --> 35:16.907
you always have to have
some guard up,

35:16.949 --> 35:18.534
especially being trans,

35:18.575 --> 35:21.370
'cause you never know
people's intentions.

35:21.411 --> 35:25.040
So, yeah, I mean,
I think it definitely

35:25.082 --> 35:29.169
pushes you to mature faster.

35:29.211 --> 35:33.966
Dealing with such serious
things that a young person

35:34.007 --> 35:37.886
unfortunately shouldn't have
to go through all the time.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.764
Like... I don't know.
This is my comfort place.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.058
This is where I'm most
comfortable,

35:43.100 --> 35:45.936
and this is my home
and where I feel most safe.

35:45.978 --> 35:50.107
So it's hard to...
wanna let go of that.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.068
And... I don't know.
I mean...

35:53.110 --> 35:57.739
I am very nervous to not
have you guys when I leave,

35:57.781 --> 35:59.867

35:59.908 --> 36:01.159
[David] You'll have us.

36:01.201 --> 36:04.246
You'll always have us.

36:04.288 --> 36:07.249
But I think it's
gonna be good.

36:07.291 --> 36:10.085
I'm excited.

36:10.127 --> 36:12.713
[Laura]
Just make sure that you eat.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.923
I eat...

36:14.965 --> 36:16.633
And sleep.
[laughs]

36:16.675 --> 36:18.510
Yeah.

36:18.552 --> 36:21.555
I just... I have one...
a question.

36:21.597 --> 36:26.602
Jidu, is your name
on the moon?

36:26.643 --> 36:28.896
[Jidu] It's on a plaque.
- How about that?

36:28.937 --> 36:31.023
You don't say!

36:31.064 --> 36:33.859
It was on Apollo 12.

36:33.901 --> 36:36.987
Apollo 12 wasn't as big
as Apollo 13.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.739
That was the big one.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.867
But I worked on Apollo 12.

36:41.909 --> 36:44.912
There was 150 engineers, of us,

36:44.953 --> 36:48.123
and we all signed the plaque

36:48.165 --> 36:50.959
that they took to
the moon with them.

36:51.001 --> 36:55.172
With my signature on there.
And that'll be on there forever
[indistinct].

36:55.213 --> 36:57.215
There you go.
Incredible.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.474
We're the old folk now.

37:05.515 --> 37:08.518
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

37:08.560 --> 37:11.271
Just a matter of time
because we're...

37:11.313 --> 37:15.442
we're just pole rushing
the abyss, you know?

37:15.484 --> 37:18.362
It's delightful.
I'm thrilled.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.989
30 more years and then what?

37:21.031 --> 37:24.326
- Dust in the wind, brother.
- Wow.

37:24.368 --> 37:27.871
[David] You know, I say
I make mistakes, right?

37:27.913 --> 37:30.749
The other night,
I thought to myself,

37:30.791 --> 37:34.002
what if I never
accepted Jane?

37:34.044 --> 37:36.171
What if we never...

37:36.213 --> 37:39.174
What if we never decided
to go on a journey with her?

37:39.216 --> 37:41.551
What if we...
What if we shunned her

37:41.593 --> 37:43.345
and pushed her back

37:43.387 --> 37:47.015
and I lost years
of my kid's life?

37:47.057 --> 37:50.519
What a... what a scoundrel,

37:50.560 --> 37:52.688
what a fraud I would be.

37:52.729 --> 37:55.273
What a horrible father
I would be.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.693
Can you imagine...

37:57.734 --> 37:59.611
being rejected by your
parents

37:59.653 --> 38:00.904
and asking them for help

38:00.946 --> 38:04.199
and asking them for support

38:04.241 --> 38:06.159
and not getting it.

38:06.201 --> 38:09.329
That's what you do
as a parent, right?

38:09.371 --> 38:11.540
You just want your kids
to be happy.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.751
You'll do anything
to make them happy.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.546
'Cause what's the alternative?

38:17.587 --> 38:21.091
What's the alternative
for a transgender child

38:21.133 --> 38:23.135
not being happy?

38:24.928 --> 38:28.306
And I wasn't going to
live through that.

38:28.348 --> 38:31.309
I wasn't going to live
through...

38:31.351 --> 38:33.395
[sniffles]

38:33.437 --> 38:36.815
seeing my child in a coffin.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.612
I wasn't gonna fail her.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.656
Absolutely not.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.408
No options.

39:15.645 --> 39:20.358
Fine. Okay. I'm fine.
How you doing? All right?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.736
- I'm okay.
- I'm proud of you.

39:22.778 --> 39:26.073

- You're doing very well.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.449
Thank you.

39:27.491 --> 39:31.411
You're gonna make it big
someday.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.663
You think so?

39:33.705 --> 39:37.167
Yeah. We're gonna watch your
video on TV, right?

39:37.209 --> 39:39.294
Yeah.

39:39.336 --> 39:40.879
That's great.

39:40.921 --> 39:45.383
I only wish my wife
was here, your grandmother,

39:45.425 --> 39:47.886
to see all this.

39:47.928 --> 39:50.889

She would love it.

For a guy whose name
is on the moon, I feel great.

And I will be on
the moon forever...

40:04.736 --> 40:08.824

40:08.865 --> 40:11.910
How many people can say
their name is on the moon?

40:11.952 --> 40:14.162
I can.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.288

beautiful life I've had.

I just hope that your life
will be as good.

You deserve it.

I love you.

- Yeah, it's nice.
- It's nice.

41:02.335 --> 41:08.633
My favorite memory is when
we all sat on your bed,

41:08.675 --> 41:11.178
and we just sat
together and talked

41:11.219 --> 41:14.097
for, like, the longest time.

41:14.139 --> 41:18.685
It's just so natural for us
to be together.

I don't want to cry right now.
I'm gonna cry.

41:21.062 --> 41:23.273
- Like an ugly cry?
- Maybe.

41:23.315 --> 41:28.069
Or like just one little
cinematic tear?

Aw.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.126
[Mae] It's like when
I look at her,

41:43.168 --> 41:46.463

all the bad people

41:46.504 --> 41:49.257

that could happen to her,

41:49.299 --> 41:50.675
I can't even bear it.

I can't bear the thought
of losing my sister

41:54.596 --> 41:57.849
to a piece of garbage person

41:57.891 --> 42:00.727
who just thinks
that she's wrong

42:00.769 --> 42:02.771
for being who she is.

42:03.897 --> 42:06.399
I know, but like, we're
growing up now.

I shouldn't have to worry
about my sister like this.

single opportunity

42:38.181 --> 42:40.934

would have.

42:40.976 --> 42:43.353
Because she has that right.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.772
And nobody can tell me
otherwise.

transition alone.

with her.
