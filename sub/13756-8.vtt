01:20.051 --> 01:22.805
So the writer tells me the main
character of the show is a cop

01:22.805 --> 01:25.638
who gets his legs blown off
in Afghanistan, comes back,

01:25.638 --> 01:28.158
gets fitted for those
carbon-compound kangaroo feet...

01:28.183 --> 01:31.217
Like that Olympics guy who shot
his girlfriend in the can...

01:31.319 --> 01:32.752
And gets back on the job.

01:32.854 --> 01:35.518
So, like what? Goes
bouncing around after the bad guys?

01:35.518 --> 01:37.218
Apparently that's the whole point.

01:37.321 --> 01:38.306
RoboDouche.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.324
I told him, "Hey, you want
to do something original?

01:40.347 --> 01:44.149
How about a series with a cop
who doesn't give a shit?"

01:44.251 --> 01:45.615
Punches out, comes home,

01:45.615 --> 01:47.481
has dinner with his family,
bangs the wife,

01:47.481 --> 01:49.194
and sleeps like a log.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.956
You write a show like that,

01:51.195 --> 01:53.029
and the job will throw you a parade.

01:53.131 --> 01:54.497
Am I right, Dennis?

02:37.465 --> 02:39.899
What the fuck you still doing here?

02:40.001 --> 02:42.001
What, do we gotta have
another party for you?

02:42.103 --> 02:45.070
Picking up some last things.

02:50.957 --> 02:53.290
Go home. Hit the links.

02:54.281 --> 02:55.947
Get the hell out of here.

03:49.704 --> 03:51.403
This is nice.

03:51.616 --> 03:52.948
Yeah, it's okay.

03:53.369 --> 03:55.109
The night of October 24th,

03:55.109 --> 03:57.342
did you encounter
the defendant and Andrea

03:57.444 --> 03:59.311
on West 87th Street?

04:01.215 --> 04:02.779
I don't think I want to
answer that question.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.720
You kind of have to, Mr. Williams.

04:04.822 --> 04:07.623
Not true, not true. It's called
the Fifth Amendment.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.368
You're concerned
about self-incrimination?

04:10.575 --> 04:12.139
What for? I ain't do nothing.

04:12.139 --> 04:14.709
Then do us all a favor
and answer the question.

04:15.076 --> 04:16.216
I don't think you right on that.

04:16.242 --> 04:18.463
But... I mean, no disrespect...

04:19.007 --> 04:19.784
But, yes.

04:20.290 --> 04:21.053
Tell her.

04:21.925 --> 04:23.013
Yeah, I saw them.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.361
Were you alone?

04:26.386 --> 04:27.089
No.

04:27.554 --> 04:29.955
Why did you tell the detective you were?

04:31.358 --> 04:32.624
I misremembered.

04:32.726 --> 04:34.559
You misremembered, that's why?

04:34.661 --> 04:37.195
Not because you were afraid
of this person you were with?

04:38.789 --> 04:39.988
Is the Fifth okay here?

04:40.208 --> 04:44.076
No. That train's left
the station, Mr. Williams.

04:45.377 --> 04:47.177
No. I'm not afraid of him.

04:47.241 --> 04:47.898
Him?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.556
Duane, dude's name is.

04:50.721 --> 04:52.160
Duane Reade.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.960
Yeah. And is that a curse or what?

04:54.062 --> 04:55.386
Bacon come to snatch your ass up,

04:55.386 --> 04:56.897
talking 'bout "What's your name, nigga?"

04:56.922 --> 04:58.173
You like, "Duane Reade."

04:58.173 --> 04:59.760
And they like, "Oh, you
trying to be funny, motherfucker?"

04:59.759 --> 05:03.064
Blam, blam, blam! "Once
again, what's your fucking name?"

05:06.599 --> 05:07.572
Right?

05:09.387 --> 05:11.220
Thank you, Mr. Williams.

05:11.323 --> 05:12.355
You got it.

05:12.457 --> 05:13.823
Mrs. Weiss?

05:13.925 --> 05:15.892
No questions, Your Honor.

05:17.596 --> 05:22.854
Mr. Duane Reade. Where
do you presently reside?

05:23.325 --> 05:24.291
The Cave.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.411
Do you mean Cavendish
State Penitentiary?

05:26.411 --> 05:27.643
That's what I said.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.812
How is it you find yourself there?

05:29.914 --> 05:33.111
They say a burglary. I say trespassing.

05:33.136 --> 05:34.368
I didn't leave with nothing.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.529
Isn't that because
the police apprehended you

05:36.554 --> 05:39.530
before you could get out the door with
the Fujitsu TV you were carrying?

05:39.531 --> 05:41.006
That's what they say.

05:41.006 --> 05:43.029
Was this your first arrest for burglary?

05:43.229 --> 05:44.557
I don't think so.

05:44.831 --> 05:46.125
I don't either.

05:46.281 --> 05:47.847
Because it was your 14th.

05:47.949 --> 05:51.987
And you assaulted seven of these
14 homeowners with a knife.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.375
One Mr. Cuatro... Do you remember him?

05:55.375 --> 05:56.908
That was self-defense.

05:57.010 --> 05:59.812
Dude come running up on me.
I had to fight for my life.

05:59.811 --> 06:03.512
Mr. Cuatro was 78 years old
and on an oxygen tank.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.758
Did you bring the knife with you?

06:06.017 --> 06:07.889
No. Got it from his kitchen.

06:07.889 --> 06:10.490
A five-inch steak knife,
according to the police report.

06:10.515 --> 06:13.983
And you were arrested in the
same manner on September 20th, 2012,

06:14.008 --> 06:15.901
in possession of another steak knife.

06:15.901 --> 06:17.181
Did you bring that one with you?

06:17.269 --> 06:19.598
Again, that was trespassing.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.653
It was aggravated sexual assault.

06:21.755 --> 06:24.189
But my question is
where the knife came from.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.830
The lady's sink, I think.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.772
Like with Mr.
Cuatro and the others here,

06:29.772 --> 06:31.359
you used a knife that was there.

06:31.384 --> 06:32.891
That's your MO?

06:34.086 --> 06:36.920
A shrug won't do, Mr.
Reade. We need to hear an answer.

06:37.759 --> 06:38.905
Okay.

06:39.794 --> 06:40.822
Yeah.

06:41.666 --> 06:44.190
Trevor Williams, you know him?

06:45.904 --> 06:47.370
Yeah, I know him.

06:47.472 --> 06:49.495
He testified you didn't say anything

06:49.495 --> 06:51.528
when you encountered the
defendant and Ms. Cornish

06:51.553 --> 06:53.508
outside her residence with him.

06:54.211 --> 06:55.610
He said you just stood there...

06:55.712 --> 06:57.245
I'm going to Sharanda's, man.

06:57.347 --> 07:01.149
...silent, watching them go inside.

07:01.251 --> 07:03.451
<i>I know they got some
weed over there, too.</i>

07:03.553 --> 07:06.588
What were you thinking about, I wonder?

07:17.254 --> 07:19.321
Any questions, Mrs. Weiss?

07:19.423 --> 07:21.957
No questions, Your Honor.

07:27.898 --> 07:30.324
Why isn't she questioning these guys?

07:30.514 --> 07:33.958
To say to the jury she's
not concerned about them.

07:34.098 --> 07:35.631
But she is.

07:37.461 --> 07:40.095
You're leaving me alone
with the undertaker?

07:40.197 --> 07:42.164
You'll be fine.

07:55.232 --> 07:56.003
Psst!

08:10.236 --> 08:12.377
What's going on here, Mr. Day?

08:12.705 --> 08:15.879
She threw a lit cigarette next to
the gas pump I was standing at.

08:15.879 --> 08:17.277
I put it out.

08:17.470 --> 08:19.340
Is that how people
usually put out cigarettes,

08:19.340 --> 08:20.773
on someone's car window?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.418
I know guys put it out in their mouth.

08:25.350 --> 08:27.516
Just before you put it out,
you knocked on the window,

08:27.618 --> 08:29.351
like people do to say "Roll it down."

08:29.453 --> 08:31.092
And we saw that she didn't roll it down.

08:31.555 --> 08:33.179
Do you think she might
have been afraid of you?

08:33.642 --> 08:35.341
Oh, no one's afraid of me.

08:35.445 --> 08:39.029
I am. After what you said to
me at the mortuary, remember?

08:39.243 --> 08:41.042
Am I right, that's inadmissible?

08:41.042 --> 08:42.424
That's "heresy," right?

08:42.635 --> 08:44.135
Something like that.

08:44.238 --> 08:46.785
Disregard Ms. Kapoor's last statement.

08:47.274 --> 08:50.742
This is an order of protection
issued against you by your wife, Michelle.

08:50.811 --> 08:52.990
Yeah, that's before
we got back together.

08:53.015 --> 08:54.215
Oh, that's good.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.600
I'm happy for you both, you
managed to resolve that somehow.

08:57.117 --> 08:59.312
What about this 911 call she made

08:59.312 --> 09:01.078
saying you were
threatening her with a knife?

09:01.180 --> 09:02.837
The police come out,

09:02.837 --> 09:04.737
by then she'd
calmed down, that was that.

09:04.762 --> 09:06.575
This is one forgiving woman.

09:07.307 --> 09:09.030
I never did nothing to her.

09:09.055 --> 09:09.970
To who?

09:10.593 --> 09:12.960
Who we talking about, my wife.

09:15.515 --> 09:18.149
So, you're done filling
your hearse at this point,

09:18.174 --> 09:19.306
but you're not leaving.

09:19.437 --> 09:21.082
You're just... I
don't know what you're doing.

09:21.106 --> 09:22.128
Just waiting?

09:22.680 --> 09:23.936
Resting.

09:29.734 --> 09:32.505
Now you're finally leaving
just as they do.

09:32.938 --> 09:34.504
Are you following them, Mr. Day?

09:34.994 --> 09:35.698
No.

09:36.074 --> 09:37.373
Where are you going, then?

09:37.474 --> 09:39.374
My whereabouts are my business.

09:39.476 --> 09:42.596
Oh, be a sport and answer the lady.

09:44.116 --> 09:44.764
Home.

09:45.517 --> 09:46.189
To Michelle?

09:46.747 --> 09:48.413
To my other residence.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.637
An SRO hotel for men on 135th Street.

09:51.637 --> 09:52.847
Is there something wrong with that?

09:52.870 --> 09:54.903
No. It's just, if
you'd gone home to Michelle

09:55.006 --> 09:58.440
or a hotel with working security cameras,
unlike this rooming house,

09:58.465 --> 10:00.796
we'd be able to verify
where you went that night.

10:00.796 --> 10:02.496
But we can't.

10:13.043 --> 10:15.577
- She doesn't listen to me, you know?
- I know.

10:18.382 --> 10:21.950
You look amazing, amazing.

10:32.521 --> 10:35.221
One. We're calling you as a witness.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.233
So while you're up there,
you can explain

10:37.233 --> 10:38.946
how you didn't kill your stepdaughter.

10:38.946 --> 10:41.080
Two. I don't work out enough,

10:41.105 --> 10:43.423
so the next time you threaten my family,

10:43.423 --> 10:46.758
it'll be one of my clients
who pays you a visit.

10:46.859 --> 10:49.131
He's from New Jersey.

11:20.339 --> 11:21.817
Arms out.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.518
Please raise your right hand.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.565
Do you swear or affirm to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

11:39.590 --> 11:40.836
and nothing but the truth?

11:41.176 --> 11:41.894
Yeah.

11:44.180 --> 11:46.747
My condolences, Mr. Taylor,
and my apologies,

11:46.849 --> 11:49.917
but there are certain things
only you can clarify for us.

11:51.056 --> 11:54.389
How would you describe your relationship
with your stepdaughter?

11:54.780 --> 11:56.914
Not great, to be honest.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.610
Honesty is why we're here.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.339
How come it wasn't great, if you know?

12:02.655 --> 12:04.275
The drugs mainly.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.444
Her drug use made our
relationship difficult.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.396
Hers with her mother.

12:09.498 --> 12:11.322
Frankly, mine with her mother.

12:11.934 --> 12:15.373
An addict's net casts wide.

12:16.271 --> 12:19.621
Her mother, your wife, Evelyn,
died last year, I was sorry to learn.

12:19.993 --> 12:21.297
How long were you married?

12:21.481 --> 12:22.514
Two years.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.849
And how did Andrea feel about it?

12:26.086 --> 12:28.853
Like a lot of kids feel
about second marriages.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.988
Seeing her mother happy...
I assume she was happy...

12:31.988 --> 12:33.716
Didn't make her daughter happy?

12:34.090 --> 12:34.800
No.

12:35.191 --> 12:36.691
Was the age difference an issue?

12:36.793 --> 12:38.687
What is it, about 20 years?

12:39.128 --> 12:42.222
It didn't help. Andrea, I mean.

12:42.547 --> 12:45.020
It didn't matter at
all to Evelyn, or me.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.420
Was there anything else about
the marriage Andrea didn't like

12:47.456 --> 12:50.026
before, during, or after it?

12:50.393 --> 12:51.032
Yeah.

12:51.761 --> 12:53.070
Evelyn's will.

12:55.218 --> 12:57.286
It entitled you to something
when Evelyn died

12:57.286 --> 12:59.701
even though you'd been
married just two years.

13:01.224 --> 13:01.790
Yeah.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.569
And Andrea was unhappy with that?

13:04.092 --> 13:06.021
"Outraged" is the word.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.155
Outraged you were to get
half her mother's estate,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.322
which included the home on 87th Street,

13:10.424 --> 13:13.492
which has a current market value
of about 10 million dollars.

13:14.884 --> 13:15.660
That's right.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.216
So outraged she filed an
appeal in a probate court

13:18.216 --> 13:21.289
in hopes it would agree
with her you deserved nothing.

13:24.185 --> 13:24.886
That's right.

13:25.290 --> 13:26.636
Did that outrage you?

13:27.568 --> 13:30.368
No. I understood why she felt like that.

13:30.471 --> 13:33.374
You understood it but
filed a countersuit against her.

13:33.748 --> 13:35.848
Did that help diffuse her outrage?

13:37.717 --> 13:39.435
No. It didn't.

13:39.724 --> 13:42.191
How did two people like
this live under one roof?

13:42.293 --> 13:43.359
They don't.

13:43.461 --> 13:45.227
She asked me to leave and I did.

13:45.330 --> 13:49.465
You moved out of her mother's
10 million-dollar house, to...?

13:49.567 --> 13:51.462
A fifth-floor walk-up in Queens.

13:52.381 --> 13:53.271
But you know what?

13:53.782 --> 13:56.116
Compared to being yelled at
by a 22-year-old drug addict

13:56.218 --> 14:00.053
day in and day out, it's paradise.

14:00.539 --> 14:01.906
Well, now all that drama is over,

14:01.906 --> 14:03.932
you can move back or sell it.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.237
That's my intention.

14:07.754 --> 14:09.754
What do you do for a living, Mr. Taylor?

14:09.856 --> 14:12.639
Personal trainer, at Atlantis Fitness.

14:12.984 --> 14:14.417
Is that where you met Evelyn?

14:14.518 --> 14:17.412
No. I met her at prior health
club I was working at, Equinox.

14:17.412 --> 14:18.945
Why'd you leave Equinox for Atlantis?

14:19.047 --> 14:20.777
- Better pay?
- No.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.208
Was it because of the
members at Equinox, women members,

14:23.233 --> 14:26.300
complained to the management about
unwanted attention from you?

14:27.470 --> 14:28.586
It wasn't true.

14:28.988 --> 14:30.855
But, yeah, a couple members said that.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.956
What do you make now at Atlantis?

14:35.646 --> 14:38.218
Look, it's obvious what you're saying,

14:38.218 --> 14:40.276
so why don't I just save
you all the cat and mouse,

14:40.276 --> 14:43.343
and these people, some
of their valuable time.

14:43.446 --> 14:46.180
I make about $35,000 a year there.

14:46.205 --> 14:49.121
Plus whatever I can
pick up with private lessons.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.687
I'm on the verge of bankruptcy.

14:51.025 --> 14:53.554
I filed for bankruptcy twice before.

14:54.031 --> 14:57.543
And no, I didn't kill my stepdaughter.

14:57.543 --> 14:58.954
Ever been arrested?

15:00.079 --> 15:00.742
Yeah.

15:01.247 --> 15:02.154
Twice, right?

15:02.377 --> 15:04.511
Both times for domestic battery?

15:05.981 --> 15:08.749
Once against your ex-wife Jean,

15:08.851 --> 15:10.644
once against Andrea's mother.

15:11.474 --> 15:14.174
Restraining orders in both cases.

15:14.199 --> 15:14.910
Yeah.

15:15.268 --> 15:18.069
Another of your entitlements
now is Andrea's trust fund,

15:18.265 --> 15:20.432
which you filed for
in Surrogate's Court.

15:20.457 --> 15:21.844
When did you file this claim?

15:23.098 --> 15:24.965
The date? I don't know.

15:25.183 --> 15:27.617
Well, here it is, so let's have a look.

15:35.964 --> 15:37.931
October 27th.

15:39.607 --> 15:41.741
That's two days after her
murder, that Monday.

15:41.843 --> 15:44.127
Of course, it's closed
on Saturday and Sunday.

15:44.494 --> 15:46.471
Is the time of filing on there?

15:47.832 --> 15:49.083
8:00 a.m.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.979
You know what time
Surrogate's Court opens?

15:52.503 --> 15:53.635
8:00 a.m.

15:53.737 --> 15:54.660
Uh-huh.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.105
And when was Andrea's funeral?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.498
That Wednesday.

15:59.829 --> 16:01.495
So, two days before you buried her,

16:01.597 --> 16:03.330
you applied for her trust fund.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.333
Okay. I think I've got
the time line straight.

16:06.435 --> 16:07.666
Just one more question.

16:08.475 --> 16:10.058
When Andrea asked you to move out,

16:10.545 --> 16:13.279
do you know if she changed
the locks after that?

16:14.134 --> 16:17.135
I don't, because I haven't
been back there.

16:17.912 --> 16:19.419
She didn't.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.262
Mrs. Weiss?

16:26.228 --> 16:27.465
No questions.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.129
Before this.

17:47.202 --> 17:49.936
I need the credit card receipts
from that night.

17:50.438 --> 17:52.938
Can't do it.
Customer's private information.

17:53.574 --> 17:55.207
Unless you brought a subpoena with you.

17:55.309 --> 17:57.131
I'm not talking about the cash purchases

17:57.131 --> 17:58.790
you have no intention of reporting,

17:58.790 --> 18:00.390
just the credit cards.

18:00.492 --> 18:02.425
Not without a subpoena.

18:02.527 --> 18:03.829
Sorry.

18:08.513 --> 18:09.913
This is my subpoena,

18:09.938 --> 18:12.171
only pretend it has a "C" on it.

18:39.028 --> 18:41.211
You should feel okay.

18:41.236 --> 18:43.509
- Do you?
- I do.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.051
Then you're a worse liar
than the stepfather.

18:47.051 --> 18:49.719
Any case, there's nothing else to do.

18:49.719 --> 18:51.452
We're out of witnesses.

18:51.554 --> 18:52.987
We're done.

18:54.957 --> 18:56.857
I want to call Naz.

19:00.258 --> 19:01.323
No, you don't.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.451
They need to hear from him.

19:02.451 --> 19:04.093
No, they don't.

19:04.093 --> 19:07.117
They've got all the reasonable
doubt they need.

19:07.116 --> 19:08.182
I disagree.

19:08.207 --> 19:09.173
You disagree?

19:09.352 --> 19:11.627
You don't know enough to disagree.

19:11.627 --> 19:12.859
Who are you again?

19:12.961 --> 19:14.995
What's your experience? Remind me.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.724
Who are you?

19:18.215 --> 19:19.036
Look...

19:19.693 --> 19:22.194
when he walked into this
courtroom on day one,

19:22.219 --> 19:24.753
he was wearing the cloak
of presumed innocence.

19:24.932 --> 19:27.401
He's still wearing it,
and will continue to

19:27.402 --> 19:29.603
unless he testifies,
then he takes it off.

19:29.705 --> 19:31.755
He forfeits it the minute
he goes up there.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.755
- No, he doesn't.
- To the jury he does.

19:33.780 --> 19:35.279
He gets in that box,

19:35.457 --> 19:38.257
they'll expect him
to prove his innocence.

19:38.742 --> 19:41.558
Any everything else we've
presented goes out the window.

19:41.558 --> 19:43.491
You mean everything I've presented.

19:45.128 --> 19:47.307
You're killing me, and that's fine,

19:47.306 --> 19:48.805
but don't kill him.

19:48.907 --> 19:51.741
Go home and write and
your closing argument.

19:55.781 --> 19:57.848
You think you can handle it?

19:58.270 --> 19:59.503
- Do you?
- I do.

19:59.528 --> 20:01.421
And I think it's important.

20:01.874 --> 20:04.146
Like, we'll lose if I don't?

20:04.777 --> 20:06.377
I'm afraid we might.

20:12.637 --> 20:15.253
If I do it, I'm gonna need some help.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.615
I'll walk you through the whole thing.

20:17.928 --> 20:19.761
But once I sit down and she stands up,

20:19.863 --> 20:21.029
there's not much I can do.

20:21.461 --> 20:23.617
That's not the kind of help I mean.

21:09.690 --> 21:10.923
Hey, John. Hey.

21:11.025 --> 21:12.992
Sorry I didn't make it to your party.

21:13.094 --> 21:14.510
You mean my wake?

21:14.996 --> 21:16.246
What you should do

21:16.246 --> 21:18.246
is come work with me
in cardholder security.

21:18.271 --> 21:20.972
I swear, it's the best job I ever had.

21:21.926 --> 21:23.492
Listen, I need a favor.

21:23.579 --> 21:27.381
I need the names and addresses
without a subpoena.

21:31.905 --> 21:33.237
No problem.

21:33.339 --> 21:35.473
I'll start packing for prison right now.

21:35.575 --> 21:36.841
Thanks, John.

21:36.943 --> 21:38.009
Hey.

22:45.385 --> 22:46.496
<i>Gate!</i>

23:35.029 --> 23:36.595
Did you bring it?

23:37.445 --> 23:39.111
You better say yes.

23:40.982 --> 23:42.415
You did it?

23:49.324 --> 23:50.990
It's okay.

24:13.180 --> 24:14.634
Where's the rest of it?

24:27.263 --> 24:28.629
I got you.

25:03.531 --> 25:04.830
Officer.

25:37.561 --> 25:39.409
In the short time you
and Andrea were together,

25:39.409 --> 25:41.644
did you develop any
feelings towards her?

25:42.011 --> 25:42.706
I did.

25:43.061 --> 25:44.138
I liked her a lot.

25:45.162 --> 25:47.356
She was fun just to be with, um...

25:47.965 --> 25:49.739
in a way a lot of my friends can't be

25:49.739 --> 25:51.072
that were raised conservatively.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.241
- As Muslims, you mean?
- Yes.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.176
Later that night when you found her,

25:55.278 --> 25:56.944
can you describe that for us?

25:58.145 --> 25:59.811
I woke up in the kitchen,

25:59.913 --> 26:01.212
and walked up the stairs,

26:01.211 --> 26:02.905
down the hall to the bedroom

26:03.280 --> 26:05.461
to get dressed and say goodbye.

26:06.849 --> 26:08.513
She didn't say anything.

26:08.751 --> 26:10.784
So, I touched her to wake her.

26:10.886 --> 26:13.312
I felt in my hand something wet.

26:13.637 --> 26:15.737
I turned on the lamp next to the bed

26:15.839 --> 26:17.055
and saw her.

26:18.108 --> 26:19.632
The blood, the wounds,

26:20.289 --> 26:21.317
and, uh...

26:23.301 --> 26:24.401
She was dead.

26:24.970 --> 26:25.895
Yeah.

26:27.539 --> 26:28.826
And you?

26:31.286 --> 26:33.603
I panicked and I ran.

26:34.314 --> 26:35.747
I wish I hadn't done that.

26:35.772 --> 26:37.972
I'm ashamed that I did that.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.062
But I did.

26:42.283 --> 26:43.537
I was scared.

26:45.967 --> 26:47.314
Did you kill her?

26:48.406 --> 26:49.479
No.

26:50.808 --> 26:52.502
No. I couldn't have.

26:53.044 --> 26:55.678
Even if I was out of my mind,
I could never do that.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.388
I know it in my heart.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.667
Thank you.

27:14.247 --> 27:15.653
Mrs. Weiss?

27:33.749 --> 27:35.696
You ever lie, Mr. Khan?

27:37.573 --> 27:39.039
I try not to.

27:39.514 --> 27:43.651
Is taking things without
permission, like taxi cabs,

27:43.651 --> 27:44.843
a kind of lie?

27:45.069 --> 27:45.801
Yes.

27:46.537 --> 27:49.705
What about getting doctors
to prescribe amphetamines

27:49.807 --> 27:53.438
and then selling them at a whopping
profit to your friends?

27:53.654 --> 27:56.613
Ever tell your conservative
parents about that?

27:57.563 --> 27:58.469
No.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.367
When Andrea got in your cab,

28:03.470 --> 28:06.298
did you ask her to get out
like those other two guys?

28:06.613 --> 28:07.684
Uh, no.

28:09.327 --> 28:10.858
'Cause she was pretty?

28:12.486 --> 28:13.285
I guess.

28:13.502 --> 28:14.434
Okay.

28:14.559 --> 28:16.225
So now she's in your cab,

28:16.289 --> 28:19.231
you're driving her around,
buying her beer.

28:19.973 --> 28:22.336
You have any notions
where it might lead?

28:23.829 --> 28:24.851
Notions?

28:25.397 --> 28:26.530
Notions, thoughts.

28:26.632 --> 28:29.366
Like, with any luck
it might lead to sex.

28:29.979 --> 28:31.812
I don't really do that type of thing.

28:31.914 --> 28:32.713
Which?

28:32.815 --> 28:35.039
Have sex with somebody I just met.

28:35.418 --> 28:38.652
Isn't that exactly what
you did three hours later?

28:41.131 --> 28:42.197
Yeah.

28:46.330 --> 28:48.785
What kind of sex did you guys have?

28:49.535 --> 28:52.745
If you're worried about
your parents hearing this,

28:52.745 --> 28:55.080
I'll give them a chance to leave.

28:59.226 --> 29:00.656
Just regular sex.

29:01.398 --> 29:03.638
I'm afraid we're gonna
need more than that.

29:03.638 --> 29:05.208
Objection. No, we don't.

29:05.907 --> 29:07.406
Overruled.

29:10.197 --> 29:12.530
I don't remember the details.

29:12.632 --> 29:14.697
Is that because you have sex so often,

29:14.722 --> 29:16.784
it kind of just all blurs together?

29:17.814 --> 29:18.634
No.

29:19.149 --> 29:21.003
How many times have you had sex,

29:21.003 --> 29:22.703
with women or men?

29:23.433 --> 29:25.801
Once before, with a girl.

29:27.708 --> 29:29.475
Only once before?

29:30.734 --> 29:33.670
And you don't remember anything
about this second time?

29:33.888 --> 29:35.688
There were a lot of drugs.

29:35.713 --> 29:38.082
Oh, we've heard.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.747
A lot of foreplay, too?

29:44.952 --> 29:48.253
No. She didn't want a lot of that.

29:48.355 --> 29:50.770
She didn't. Okay.

29:51.398 --> 29:52.500
How about you?

29:53.167 --> 29:55.000
Is that how you like it?

29:55.102 --> 29:56.540
How would you like it?

29:58.017 --> 29:59.159
Excuse me?

30:00.786 --> 30:03.011
Having to sit up here in
front of all these people,

30:04.190 --> 30:06.196
answering this type of question?

30:07.704 --> 30:09.273
That's what you meant.

30:10.346 --> 30:11.656
Well, I wouldn't.

30:11.981 --> 30:14.281
But if I was on trial for murder

30:14.383 --> 30:16.456
and freely chose to testify,

30:16.456 --> 30:19.051
I'd have to answer
the questions I'm asked.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.618
You know what,

30:24.409 --> 30:27.896
let's go to just after
not-much-foreplay sex.

30:27.921 --> 30:32.257
What you did between then and when you say
you woke up in the kitchen downstairs.

30:32.359 --> 30:33.981
I don't remember.

30:35.005 --> 30:38.282
This is a crucial
period of time, Mr. Khan.

30:38.549 --> 30:40.573
You might want to try
harder to remember,

30:40.573 --> 30:41.939
for your sake.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.708
I know, but I can't.

30:44.810 --> 30:45.876
Nothing?

30:45.978 --> 30:48.639
Not doing anything?
Not hearing anything?

30:48.638 --> 30:50.038
Not even going down there?

30:50.140 --> 30:51.439
Nothing.

30:51.541 --> 30:52.941
So, you woke up.

30:53.610 --> 30:54.968
You walk back upstairs.

30:55.330 --> 30:56.858
You found her dead.

30:57.299 --> 30:59.432
And you ran in a blind panic?

30:59.457 --> 31:00.356
Yes.

31:01.241 --> 31:03.241
But then you ran back
and broke back into

31:03.266 --> 31:06.734
the same place you just ran
from in a blind panic.

31:06.913 --> 31:08.075
Remind me why?

31:08.075 --> 31:10.609
My car keys were in my jacket,
which was inside.

31:11.144 --> 31:11.970
Right.

31:12.350 --> 31:14.883
So you grabbed your jacket
and ran out again.

31:14.883 --> 31:15.791
Yes.

31:16.685 --> 31:17.997
Grab anything else?

31:17.997 --> 31:18.807
No.

31:20.015 --> 31:22.849
The vial of ketamine was
already in your jacket pocket?

31:22.951 --> 31:25.785
No, you're right. I picked
that up off the coffee table.

31:25.888 --> 31:29.995
This... This drug your...
your attorney says was Andrea's?

31:30.958 --> 31:32.157
It was hers.

31:32.486 --> 31:34.013
So why would you take it?

31:35.917 --> 31:37.284
I don't know.

31:37.792 --> 31:38.726
Take anything else?

31:38.751 --> 31:39.398
No.

31:40.738 --> 31:41.586
Think.

31:46.052 --> 31:46.915
No.

31:47.620 --> 31:50.988
So the murder weapon
was already in your pocket?

31:51.090 --> 31:52.155
Objection.

31:53.159 --> 31:53.773
Fine.

31:53.773 --> 31:56.374
So the knife was already in your pocket?

31:56.475 --> 31:58.942
No. I took that with me, too.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.095
Why?

32:02.086 --> 32:03.833
Because I knew how it looked.

32:04.489 --> 32:08.058
You were drunk, drugged, scared,

32:08.160 --> 32:10.226
and in a blind panic.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.238
But you still knew how it looked?

32:13.978 --> 32:15.011
Yeah.

32:15.112 --> 32:16.444
How did it look?

32:18.815 --> 32:20.382
Like I killed her.

32:26.057 --> 32:26.846
All right.

32:27.365 --> 32:30.402
So you left the house again
with the ketamine and the knife,

32:30.402 --> 32:31.968
got in your father's cab...

32:32.104 --> 32:35.872
We've heard what happened after that
from law enforcement officers...

32:35.897 --> 32:37.041
And now...

32:37.536 --> 32:39.135
you're in a patrol car,

32:39.238 --> 32:41.525
being taken to the precinct
by Officer Bell,

32:41.525 --> 32:43.325
who thinks you're a witness,

32:43.427 --> 32:45.207
and you ask him what?

32:46.794 --> 32:48.277
Is she dead?

32:49.362 --> 32:50.695
Why did you ask him that?

32:50.797 --> 32:52.841
Because I hoped it wasn't true.

32:53.099 --> 32:56.801
Please read back the
testimony from "I turned on the lamp."

32:58.004 --> 33:01.251
Mr Kahn, "I turned on the lamp next
to the bed and saw her.

33:01.251 --> 33:02.917
The blood, the wounds, and..."

33:02.942 --> 33:04.380
Ms. Kapoor, "She was dead."

33:04.380 --> 33:05.913
Mr. Khan, "Yeah."

33:06.015 --> 33:09.717
So, when you saw her just before
you ran in a blind panic,

33:09.718 --> 33:11.218
she was dead.

33:11.320 --> 33:13.954
And two hours later in the patrol car,

33:14.056 --> 33:15.655
you weren't sure?

33:16.698 --> 33:18.297
She looked like she was dead.

33:18.493 --> 33:20.382
But conceivably she wasn't?

33:20.383 --> 33:21.449
I don't know.

33:22.953 --> 33:24.207
You didn't check her pulse?

33:24.207 --> 33:24.877
No.

33:25.375 --> 33:27.408
You didn't call 911?

33:27.510 --> 33:28.366
No.

33:29.779 --> 33:33.648
Why not, if it was possible
she was still alive?

33:36.665 --> 33:38.632
I don't know. I wasn't thinking.

33:40.140 --> 33:42.841
You see why I'm
having some trouble here?

33:44.787 --> 33:50.137
You had the presence of mind
to run from a crime scene,

33:50.137 --> 33:53.564
to remove evidence
implicating you in the crime,

33:53.564 --> 33:57.671
to operate a motor vehicle
without crashing into anything,

33:59.261 --> 34:01.067
but you didn't have the presence of mind

34:01.067 --> 34:03.738
to dial three numbers on your phone?

34:16.268 --> 34:20.829
The prophet Muhammad
has this to say about that.

34:21.820 --> 34:26.813
"Hurry with all the strength of your
legs to the one who needs help."

34:27.694 --> 34:30.362
Is that what you did for Andrea?

34:38.632 --> 34:40.800
Here's the deal, Mr. Khan,

34:40.902 --> 34:42.041
and you know it.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.225
Whether you stabbed her or not,

34:45.952 --> 34:47.784
you could have saved her.

34:47.887 --> 34:50.588
This young woman who you barely knew,

34:50.690 --> 34:53.056
but who you say you liked...

35:00.625 --> 35:02.062
Did you kill her?

35:18.667 --> 35:20.113
I don't know.

35:28.826 --> 35:30.069
I'm done.

35:47.110 --> 35:48.295
Ms. Kapoor?

35:50.731 --> 35:52.324
Um...

35:53.901 --> 35:56.135
The Defense rests, Your Honor.

36:12.688 --> 36:16.402
You know, at the
beginning, I thought we had maybe a...

36:17.326 --> 36:18.828
10% shot.

36:20.163 --> 36:21.379
Now?

36:22.514 --> 36:23.842
Zero.

36:28.842 --> 36:30.584
You just convicted him.

36:58.574 --> 36:59.907
No...

37:03.835 --> 37:05.935
I'm not discussing it.

37:17.461 --> 37:19.189
Jurors, I'll remind you

37:19.189 --> 37:21.259
not to discuss this case with anyone,

37:21.259 --> 37:25.419
and keep your TVs,
computers, and iPads off.

37:25.763 --> 37:28.764
Have a nice, electronics-free weekend.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.421
I'll see you on Monday.

39:39.742 --> 39:40.805
Hey, Mike.

39:41.723 --> 39:44.266
The shooting in the
strip club last Yom Kippur.

39:44.266 --> 39:45.862
What was the vic's name again?

39:46.457 --> 39:47.961
Are you still here?

39:48.219 --> 39:50.752
What the fuck?

39:52.156 --> 39:53.859
You don't remember?

41:30.666 --> 41:32.666
Red Label, rocks.

41:36.034 --> 41:37.166
How's it going?

41:39.404 --> 41:39.895
Good.

41:41.006 --> 41:42.013
Dennis.

41:42.608 --> 41:43.513
Ray.

41:44.009 --> 41:46.143
- Nice to meet you.
- Yup.

41:46.245 --> 41:47.978
What do you do, Ray?

41:50.209 --> 41:51.436
Financial advisor.

41:51.436 --> 41:52.309
Ah.

41:52.871 --> 41:53.995
I play golf.

41:55.556 --> 41:57.957
Like, a golf pro?

41:58.059 --> 41:59.657
Like retired.

42:00.461 --> 42:02.334
Used to drink Midleton,

42:02.830 --> 42:05.687
but for us pensioners,
it's rail scotch from now on.

42:05.865 --> 42:07.533
Good days are gone.

42:08.069 --> 42:08.771
Excuse me.

42:08.991 --> 42:09.990
Hi. Check.

42:10.093 --> 42:12.593
- You don't remember me.
- Huh?

42:12.696 --> 42:14.529
I was at the 2-1
the night you got shot.

42:14.554 --> 42:16.059
I talked to you in the hospital.

42:16.059 --> 42:18.292
Christ, what's that like?

42:18.393 --> 42:20.353
I mean, not getting shot.
I know what that's like.

42:20.429 --> 42:22.861
But getting shot two
inches from your balls

42:22.861 --> 42:24.660
by some fucking pimp?

42:26.256 --> 42:27.288
It was nice meeting you.

42:27.289 --> 42:29.429
I just told you, we met
before, on Yom Kippur, at the hospital.

42:29.429 --> 42:30.821
Yeah, I heard you. I don't care.

42:30.821 --> 42:31.685
Ray...

42:32.988 --> 42:34.021
Sit.

42:45.043 --> 42:46.197
What were you thinking then?

42:46.197 --> 42:47.696
'Cause I just don't get it.

42:47.798 --> 42:50.337
You think you can beat up
prostitutes like that?

42:50.337 --> 42:52.738
And there's not gonna be
some kind of consequence?

42:52.738 --> 42:54.472
And keep doing it?

42:54.574 --> 42:57.208
Are you out of your mind?

42:57.611 --> 42:58.883
You are, aren't you?

42:59.880 --> 43:01.380
We got another connection.

43:01.482 --> 43:03.556
Friend of yours and my last job

43:03.556 --> 43:05.456
before this fucking retirement.

43:05.558 --> 43:06.924
Andrea.

43:08.354 --> 43:09.390
Tragic death.

43:09.389 --> 43:10.963
Nice girl by all accounts.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.596
I mean, she had her personal problems,

43:12.698 --> 43:13.797
but who doesn't?

43:13.822 --> 43:14.675
You do.

43:15.334 --> 43:18.235
How much money do you
lose here every month?

43:21.058 --> 43:24.396
Is that what the fight was
about that night? Money?

43:25.644 --> 43:27.461
Withdrawals from her accounts?

43:28.019 --> 43:30.787
Or are you gonna tell me
it was just a lover's quarrel?

43:31.714 --> 43:33.981
She was a client, not a girlfriend.

43:34.921 --> 43:36.921
I'm not sure which is worse for you,

43:36.946 --> 43:39.599
but I beg to differ.

43:40.154 --> 43:43.612
So you went there later, after this.

43:43.806 --> 43:46.052
Woke her up, tried to talk to her again.

43:46.273 --> 43:47.979
Told her you'd get her money back...

43:47.979 --> 43:48.939
Of course, you couldn't.

43:49.014 --> 43:50.324
She told you to get the fuck out,

43:50.348 --> 43:52.093
maybe reached for the
phone to call the cops,

43:52.117 --> 43:54.961
you went downstairs, opened
the drawer, took a knife out...

43:54.986 --> 43:56.443
The killer's on trial.

43:56.443 --> 43:58.242
You guys arrested him.

43:58.345 --> 44:01.087
I'm not her boyfriend.
And now I'm leaving.

44:01.112 --> 44:04.302
Now you're just being stupid.

44:06.731 --> 44:08.798
It's better for you you were seeing her.

44:08.900 --> 44:11.828
That explains your semen in her bedroom.

44:12.470 --> 44:16.486
If you weren't her boyfriend,
then what the fuck, Ray?

44:16.486 --> 44:18.323
Don't be an idiot.

44:20.424 --> 44:21.857
I know you know what's next.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.194
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

44:25.464 --> 44:26.039
Home.

44:26.039 --> 44:27.995
Everyone's at home eventually.

44:28.020 --> 44:29.948
Before that, say, around midnight.

44:31.396 --> 44:32.362
Here's the deal...

44:32.464 --> 44:34.230
Here's the deal, talk to my lawyer.

44:34.332 --> 44:36.515
Oh, I will or rather,
the prosecutor will.

44:36.515 --> 44:37.741
But that's not the deal.

44:37.741 --> 44:38.796
The deal...

44:39.475 --> 44:41.488
is I know you weren't home.

44:42.345 --> 44:45.181
Fucking cell phones,
pinging all the time,

44:45.181 --> 44:46.788
even when you turn 'em off.

44:47.384 --> 44:48.659
And I will find the knife.

44:48.659 --> 44:49.637
We're done.

44:49.790 --> 44:51.256
No problem.

44:51.358 --> 44:53.209
Another Red Label.

44:58.437 --> 45:00.361
What, are you waiting for me
to cuff you or something?

45:00.360 --> 45:01.923
I told you, I'm retired.

45:02.085 --> 45:03.770
Get the fuck out of here.

45:12.219 --> 45:13.962
Forgot his hat.

45:53.274 --> 45:54.540
Can I sit?

45:58.319 --> 45:59.452
What's your name?

45:59.554 --> 46:01.087
Terry.

46:01.189 --> 46:02.637
Naz.

46:05.810 --> 46:07.243
Who did that to you?

46:09.080 --> 46:10.279
I don't know.

46:11.191 --> 46:12.882
That's a good start, Terry.

46:13.752 --> 46:16.095
Let me guess, they told you
to tell your mom or whatever,

46:16.095 --> 46:18.057
to put money into
their commissary account

46:18.082 --> 46:19.660
and you said no.

46:22.074 --> 46:23.874
That's exactly what happened.

46:25.168 --> 46:26.538
You married?

46:31.967 --> 46:33.405
I gotta talk to a friend of mine first,

46:33.405 --> 46:35.571
but I can maybe get you
some protection in here.

46:37.475 --> 46:39.535
You don't gotta say yes or no now.

46:39.535 --> 46:41.361
Just putting it out there.

46:43.357 --> 46:44.467
Okay.

46:58.129 --> 46:59.595
He's married.

46:59.697 --> 47:02.097
So he could swallow
his wife's dope hisself.

47:11.634 --> 47:15.075
She didn't exactly keep her financial
records neatly organized,

47:15.075 --> 47:16.508
but neither did we.

47:16.611 --> 47:20.246
Most of her bank statements were
still in their envelopes unopened,

47:20.271 --> 47:22.676
scattered around
with old "Vogue" magazines

47:22.676 --> 47:23.741
and some junk mail,

47:23.741 --> 47:26.275
which CSU basically threw into a box.

47:27.278 --> 47:30.512
But this one she did open, September's.

47:33.464 --> 47:36.064
Three hundred thousand, gone.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.643
She could have loaned it to him.

47:41.643 --> 47:43.476
Or he could have just taken it.

47:43.501 --> 47:45.201
He had power of attorney.

47:45.379 --> 47:47.410
In any case, she knew.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.567
He said he went home after this,

47:51.669 --> 47:53.035
and he did,

47:53.060 --> 47:54.993
via the Midtown Tunnel,

47:55.173 --> 47:59.443
through a cash lane, even
though he's got an E-ZPass.

48:01.857 --> 48:04.197
Yeah. At 2:00 a.m.

48:04.663 --> 48:07.705
And here he is at 3:00 a.m.

48:31.771 --> 48:33.726
We've got more on the kid.

50:36.574 --> 50:37.793
Ladies and gentlemen,

50:37.793 --> 50:40.266
Mrs. Weiss has presented to us a case...

50:40.266 --> 50:43.586
Ladies and gentlemen, the Constitution
asks of you to review...

50:43.587 --> 50:45.720
The Constitution asks of you

50:45.745 --> 50:47.711
to review the material

50:47.891 --> 50:49.391
in light of the evidence presented,

50:49.493 --> 50:50.813
and asks that we ask ourselves...

50:50.838 --> 50:53.639
What she did was unprofessional,
unethical,

50:53.664 --> 50:55.269
and grounds for a mistrial,

50:55.269 --> 50:57.357
after which, the State asks itself

50:57.357 --> 50:59.212
"Do we really wanna go
through all this again

50:59.212 --> 51:03.548
knowing next time he'll have a
real attorney defending him?"

51:04.744 --> 51:05.316
You?

51:05.574 --> 51:07.831
No. Someone good.

51:07.831 --> 51:09.197
They'll be lining up.

51:11.535 --> 51:13.035
What would happen to her?

51:13.103 --> 51:16.235
What do you care? You
like her like you liked Andrea?

51:16.470 --> 51:18.535
Take your hand off your dick.

51:21.909 --> 51:23.083
Are you high?

51:24.363 --> 51:25.126
No.

51:26.965 --> 51:28.940
What'll happen to her
is something between

51:28.940 --> 51:30.904
a reprimand and a disbarment.

51:30.905 --> 51:33.673
Probably, her career is over.

51:33.775 --> 51:37.208
But it's your life
we're talking about, so...

51:41.716 --> 51:45.982
Look, 20 years from now
when you wake up in your cell,

51:45.982 --> 51:48.015
and you look at yourself
in your dented tin mirror,

51:48.040 --> 51:50.007
here's what you're gonna see.

51:51.943 --> 51:53.721
Someone you don't recognize,

51:54.045 --> 51:55.314
who made the wrong decision

51:55.314 --> 51:57.753
when he had the chance to save himself.

52:03.155 --> 52:04.228
Is that a yes?

52:12.028 --> 52:14.095
Okay. Good.

52:15.509 --> 52:18.077
Ah, I wish you hadn't done that.

52:19.654 --> 52:21.235
Why, you don't like it?

52:21.916 --> 52:22.822
No.

52:23.986 --> 52:25.765
It's on the jury's side.

52:48.281 --> 52:50.944
I really don't know
what to say, Ms. Kapoor.

52:51.528 --> 52:52.460
Do you?

52:53.230 --> 52:54.683
I made a terrible mistake.

52:54.683 --> 52:55.626
Mistake?

52:56.285 --> 52:57.618
Okay, let me ask you.

52:57.720 --> 53:01.021
What other careers did
you consider in college?

53:02.653 --> 53:05.882
Okay. This is what's going to happen.

53:05.883 --> 53:09.934
I'm going to turn this into the
ethics committee, obviously,

53:09.933 --> 53:11.213
then finish this trial.

53:11.213 --> 53:13.280
Ms. Kapoor, you are now second chair.

53:13.382 --> 53:16.038
John, you'll take over.

53:17.493 --> 53:18.692
I can't do that.

53:18.795 --> 53:19.794
Sure, you can.

53:19.896 --> 53:22.396
There's nothing left
but closing arguments.

53:22.498 --> 53:24.167
The jury's barely seen me.

53:24.192 --> 53:27.126
All of a sudden, I'm there
giving the closing argument?

53:27.307 --> 53:28.640
It'll be fine.

53:28.938 --> 53:30.638
Nah, nah, no, no.

53:30.740 --> 53:31.995
No. This is...

53:31.995 --> 53:33.909
clearly grounds for a mistrial.

53:33.909 --> 53:36.052
No. What this is,

53:36.122 --> 53:38.769
is an attempt to try
to force a mistrial.

53:39.314 --> 53:41.848
But you don't force
anything in my court.

53:43.408 --> 53:45.184
Well... I'll... I'll appeal.

53:45.184 --> 53:46.350
No law against it.

53:46.452 --> 53:48.285
I'm serious. I heard you.

53:48.388 --> 53:50.521
Which won't be good for you.

53:52.243 --> 53:53.752
Excuse me?

53:58.738 --> 54:03.110
It'll be fine, John.
You'll do fine in there.

54:04.815 --> 54:06.100
Bye now.

54:35.651 --> 54:37.098
It didn't work.

54:37.199 --> 54:38.465
Sorry?

54:38.567 --> 54:41.312
That tape you dropped off at my door,

54:41.312 --> 54:42.647
there's no mistrial.

54:43.478 --> 54:45.645
Ten dumplings. Hold on.

54:45.670 --> 54:47.077
I'm not following.

54:47.177 --> 54:48.210
Sure you are.

54:48.210 --> 54:49.968
My question is why?

54:50.695 --> 54:53.613
I really don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

54:55.422 --> 54:56.922
What'd you find, huh?

54:58.207 --> 55:00.707
You must be pretty sure about it.

55:04.627 --> 55:05.727
Who is it?

55:14.120 --> 55:15.619
Who did it?

55:23.743 --> 55:25.493
It may not be that bad.

55:26.149 --> 55:28.034
The circumstances,
the fact you're young,

55:28.034 --> 55:30.634
you know, that'll count for something.

55:37.251 --> 55:38.261
Thank you.

55:38.895 --> 55:39.960
For?

55:41.263 --> 55:42.175
For, um...

55:42.618 --> 55:45.920
I don't know, not lecturing me.

55:46.957 --> 55:48.422
I'm too busy to lecture.

55:49.012 --> 55:51.567
Besides, you know what you did.

55:53.609 --> 55:57.177
So chin up, finish this trial...

55:58.549 --> 56:01.152
and then clear out your fucking desk.

56:18.092 --> 56:21.827
Ladies and gentlemen...

56:35.725 --> 56:37.291
Oh...

56:41.165 --> 56:43.832
Ladies and gentlemen...

56:43.934 --> 56:48.283
when you file a request
for a document from the FBI

56:48.283 --> 56:50.816
under the Freedom of Information Act,

56:50.919 --> 56:53.179
this is what you get.

56:53.601 --> 56:56.201
It's called a redacted document,

56:56.303 --> 56:59.004
edited to render unreadable

56:59.106 --> 57:03.075
any content the FBI deems a
threat to national security,

57:03.177 --> 57:07.928
or, more often, to the security of
the workings of the FBI itself.

57:08.256 --> 57:12.865
Redaction equals self-preservation.

57:13.084 --> 57:16.263
Like this, there is a redaction

57:16.263 --> 57:19.518
in the middle of what
the defendant has told you

57:19.518 --> 57:21.518
about the night of Andrea's murder,

57:21.621 --> 57:24.201
a black rectangle of nothing

57:24.201 --> 57:26.565
between the time he had sex with her,

57:26.565 --> 57:29.600
and when he, as he says,
found her bleeding out.

57:29.702 --> 57:32.363
He says he can't remember anything.

57:32.362 --> 57:35.496
He fell asleep. He passed out.

57:35.598 --> 57:40.234
He has redacted a crucial
period of time.

57:40.336 --> 57:44.107
Why? For the same reason
this is blacked out.

57:44.772 --> 57:47.273
Self-preservation.

57:51.890 --> 57:54.909
His defense team has tried to say

57:54.909 --> 57:58.119
there are other people
with motive, opportunity,

57:58.119 --> 58:00.905
and histories more consistent
than Mr. Khan's

58:00.905 --> 58:03.319
with such a horrendous crime as this.

58:03.474 --> 58:04.834
I'd ask why,

58:04.834 --> 58:06.597
but you know why.

58:06.596 --> 58:07.862
It's desperation.

58:07.964 --> 58:11.099
Because they know a redacted
story doesn't sit well

58:11.201 --> 58:13.015
with an intelligent jury.

58:14.278 --> 58:15.672
Is there any evidence

58:15.672 --> 58:19.007
any other person was
in the house that night?

58:19.397 --> 58:23.692
No. Nasir Khan was the
only person in the house

58:23.692 --> 58:25.659
the night Andrea was murdered,

58:25.761 --> 58:29.462
in the bedroom she was murdered,
in the bed she was murdered.

58:29.565 --> 58:31.677
He's the only person
whose blood is there,

58:31.677 --> 58:34.468
whose prints are there,
whose semen is there.

58:34.780 --> 58:37.333
The only person who had
a knife in his pocket

58:37.333 --> 58:38.999
with her blood on it.

58:39.101 --> 58:42.569
He was that night, and to this day,

58:42.671 --> 58:45.672
the only suspect the police considered.

58:45.774 --> 58:47.608
Because...

58:59.616 --> 59:01.933
Because he was and is

59:02.709 --> 59:07.216
the only killer of this
beautiful, young woman.

59:27.391 --> 59:30.840
This is not a penknife
or a grapefruit knife.

59:30.840 --> 59:33.941
This knife is designed
to cut through meat,

59:34.043 --> 59:36.444
and that's what Mr. Khan used it for,

59:36.546 --> 59:40.889
cutting through tendons,
muscle, bone, and a heart,

59:40.889 --> 59:42.989
22 times.

01:00:02.771 --> 01:00:04.071
Thank you.

01:00:10.943 --> 01:00:12.644
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:00:14.317 --> 01:00:15.740
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:00:16.407 --> 01:00:17.472
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:00:17.536 --> 01:00:20.189
Ladies and gentlemen,
in the rush to judgment...

01:00:20.214 --> 01:00:22.503
Okay, now. The rushed...

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:24.019
There's two other guys.

01:00:24.019 --> 01:00:25.230
There's Duane Reade...

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.304
You can't deny that.

01:00:26.304 --> 01:00:27.537
That's right.

01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:30.740
God!

01:00:30.842 --> 01:00:32.042
Right.

01:00:32.144 --> 01:00:33.529
What the fuck?

01:00:33.554 --> 01:00:34.620
God!

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.739
Fuck!

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.119
God!

01:00:39.222 --> 01:00:43.221
Oh, no, hey, I need this
like a fucking hole in the head!

01:00:43.221 --> 01:00:44.320
Aah!

01:01:19.392 --> 01:01:20.325
Fuck!

01:01:29.213 --> 01:01:30.423
Fucking get...

01:01:35.813 --> 01:01:36.979
Fuck!

01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:39.481
God.

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:54.471
You under any unusual stress?

01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:56.344
You could say that.

01:01:58.962 --> 01:02:00.187
Who gave you this?

01:02:00.187 --> 01:02:02.514
Some Chinese guy on Canal Street.

01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:03.733
Canal Street.

01:02:04.082 --> 01:02:06.750
Did he also offer to
re-tar your driveway?

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:11.865
Unless you like insomnia, panic attacks,
confusion, and psychosis,

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.047
you don't want to
make a habit out of this.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.495
Oh...

01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:33.709
I'm gonna be honest with you.

01:02:35.173 --> 01:02:37.266
This isn't what I normally do.

01:02:38.395 --> 01:02:40.996
I mean, obviously,
someone who looks like this

01:02:41.098 --> 01:02:43.699
doesn't make his living
doing public speaking.

01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:48.237
I'm sorry you even have to look at this.

01:02:50.919 --> 01:02:54.787
What I normally do is,
uh, plea my clients out,

01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:58.547
because 95% of the time, they did
what they were charged with.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:00.519
They sold that dope,

01:03:00.519 --> 01:03:01.657
they solicited that guy,

01:03:01.657 --> 01:03:02.855
they stole that iPhone.

01:03:02.855 --> 01:03:04.755
It's clear to me just looking at them.

01:03:04.857 --> 01:03:06.523
So, I tell them, uh,

01:03:06.626 --> 01:03:09.350
"Don't be stupid, take the deal."

01:03:13.094 --> 01:03:17.901
The first time I saw Naz,
he was sitting alone

01:03:18.004 --> 01:03:20.284
in a holding cell at the 21st Precinct.

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:22.386
He'd just been arrested.

01:03:23.985 --> 01:03:26.986
I walked past him,

01:03:27.088 --> 01:03:31.023
out of the station and then stopped.

01:03:33.666 --> 01:03:36.776
I turned around and went back.

01:03:37.837 --> 01:03:39.002
Why?

01:03:40.072 --> 01:03:45.497
Because I didn't see what
I see in my other clients.

01:03:46.867 --> 01:03:49.301
And I still don't after all this time.

01:03:50.703 --> 01:03:53.878
What I see is what happens
when you put a kid in Rikers

01:03:53.879 --> 01:03:58.020
and say, "Okay, now survive that

01:03:58.774 --> 01:04:02.275
"while we try you for something
you didn't do."

01:04:02.377 --> 01:04:05.177
And that's how you survive Rikers.

01:04:06.817 --> 01:04:10.839
Oh, there were crimes committed
that night, no doubt.

01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:13.021
Crime one,

01:04:13.123 --> 01:04:14.836
stood up by a friend with a car,

01:04:14.836 --> 01:04:17.904
a young man takes his father's
cab without permission

01:04:18.006 --> 01:04:20.157
to go to a party in Manhattan.

01:04:20.608 --> 01:04:25.774
Crime two, a young woman buys
some powerful illegal drugs.

01:04:26.314 --> 01:04:29.762
Crime three, on the banks
of the Hudson River,

01:04:29.762 --> 01:04:31.596
under the George Washington Bridge,

01:04:31.698 --> 01:04:37.268
she gives him one of those
illegal drugs, MDMA.

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:38.519
Crime four,

01:04:38.519 --> 01:04:40.119
later at her house,

01:04:40.221 --> 01:04:43.322
she gives him another
illegal drug, ketamine,

01:04:43.424 --> 01:04:44.923
which, with the Ecstasy,

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:48.447
and enough tequila to topple
a saguaro cactus,

01:04:48.447 --> 01:04:51.961
knocks him out like the horses
vets give ketamine to.

01:04:52.984 --> 01:04:54.426
Crime five,

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:56.815
upon discovering the body,

01:04:56.815 --> 01:04:59.689
instead of reporting it, he runs.

01:05:00.118 --> 01:05:04.078
Crime six, he makes
an illegal left turn.

01:05:04.623 --> 01:05:09.429
Crime seven, he resists arrest.

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:15.120
Those are the crimes committed by
these two young people that night,

01:05:15.222 --> 01:05:17.691
and the only ones we have proof of.

01:05:17.871 --> 01:05:19.381
What we don't have proof of

01:05:19.381 --> 01:05:22.949
is who committed the crime
he's been charged with.

01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:27.066
The prosecution has presented
what it says is proof,

01:05:27.528 --> 01:05:29.157
but at the end of the day,

01:05:29.811 --> 01:05:34.080
it's circumstance and speculation.

01:05:37.449 --> 01:05:41.203
The rush to judgment against Nasir Khan

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:42.996
began at the 21st Precinct

01:05:42.996 --> 01:05:46.096
at 4:45 a.m. the night of,

01:05:46.097 --> 01:05:48.399
and ended 10 seconds later

01:05:48.399 --> 01:05:50.298
when he was tackled to the floor.

01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:53.446
The police investigated no one else,

01:05:53.844 --> 01:05:58.115
not the stepfather who had a tempestuous
relationship with the victim,

01:05:58.115 --> 01:06:01.676
even though the percentage of
killers who know their victims

01:06:01.675 --> 01:06:05.525
is five times greater
than that of strangers,

01:06:05.525 --> 01:06:09.570
and even though among the
fraction of strangers who do commit murder.

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:11.536
There were two individuals

01:06:11.639 --> 01:06:14.093
the couple had confrontations
with that night.

01:06:14.093 --> 01:06:16.093
One with a history of battery,

01:06:16.194 --> 01:06:19.107
the other with multiple convictions

01:06:19.107 --> 01:06:20.590
for aggravated assault,

01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:26.027
every time using a knife
from the victim's own home.

01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:42.697
The night Naz was arrested,
he lost a lot.

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:47.378
He lost his freedom

01:06:47.938 --> 01:06:51.611
to return home to his
family, to his school,

01:06:51.611 --> 01:06:55.346
to his night job that helps
pay for that school.

01:06:55.448 --> 01:06:59.810
But what he didn't lose,
and what none of us can lose,

01:07:00.502 --> 01:07:02.924
were his Constitutional rights

01:07:03.268 --> 01:07:04.900
to an attorney,

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:08.294
to a fair and impartial trial by you,

01:07:08.396 --> 01:07:10.229
his peers,

01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:13.799
and to the presumption of his innocence

01:07:13.901 --> 01:07:17.103
beyond a reasonable doubt.

01:07:21.502 --> 01:07:23.390
We hear that term a lot.

01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:26.816
But what does it really mean, huh?

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:29.919
What's its definition?

01:07:32.293 --> 01:07:34.303
It doesn't have one.

01:07:35.227 --> 01:07:37.632
It's what we think,

01:07:38.052 --> 01:07:41.033
and as much as what we
think, what we feel.

01:07:42.822 --> 01:07:44.031
And what we feel

01:07:45.324 --> 01:07:47.060
and what you feel

01:07:48.093 --> 01:07:49.492
will determine

01:07:49.595 --> 01:07:54.965
what happens to the rest
of this young man's life.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.499
Thank you.

01:08:23.455 --> 01:08:24.854
Thank you.

01:09:21.977 --> 01:09:23.710
Nothing.

01:09:24.872 --> 01:09:26.828
See you tomorrow.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:50.885
Okay.

01:09:51.206 --> 01:09:54.240
Oh, we got your Viagra now.

01:09:54.405 --> 01:09:56.305
I don't give a fuck anymore.

01:09:57.024 --> 01:09:58.617
That's a good one.

01:09:59.172 --> 01:09:59.991
Want a receipt?

01:10:00.016 --> 01:10:01.045
Mm-mm.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.048
Worst comes to worst,
it's not so bad in here, is it?

01:10:54.156 --> 01:10:54.912
I mean...

01:10:55.719 --> 01:10:57.953
you got people that care
about you in here.

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:00.814
I care about you.

01:11:03.546 --> 01:11:04.688
Why?

01:11:05.931 --> 01:11:08.165
How many times I gotta tell you?

01:11:08.268 --> 01:11:09.868
I don't believe it.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:13.659
Man, these dudes in here,

01:11:13.841 --> 01:11:16.747
upstate, places I've been...

01:11:18.546 --> 01:11:22.248
I mean, whether they in here
for selling drugs or murder,

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:24.896
they all got one thing in common.

01:11:25.903 --> 01:11:27.600
You ask them,

01:11:27.665 --> 01:11:30.234
every last one say they innocent.

01:11:31.169 --> 01:11:33.511
But they all got that stink about them,

01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:35.711
every moron to millionaire,

01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:37.740
that lying stink.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.876
But you?

01:11:43.238 --> 01:11:45.471
You smell like innocence.

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:55.615
You the real deal, Naz.

01:11:55.897 --> 01:11:57.465
That makes you one of a kind.

01:11:58.207 --> 01:12:00.762
And the fact that you under my wing?

01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:05.343
It's like... like I got
something nobody else got.

01:12:07.173 --> 01:12:08.408
It's like...

01:12:09.512 --> 01:12:12.013
like I got a unicorn.

01:12:15.452 --> 01:12:17.619
So why would I not take care of you?

01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:23.358
What kind of a cold individual
do you think I am?

01:13:33.975 --> 01:13:35.275
All rise.

01:13:49.587 --> 01:13:50.887
How we doing?

01:13:53.259 --> 01:13:54.859
Not good.

01:13:56.452 --> 01:13:57.722
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

01:13:57.723 --> 01:13:59.428
but I have to ask you to go back.

01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:02.330
Your Honor, we're not
getting anywhere in there.

01:14:02.899 --> 01:14:04.609
You're discussing things.

01:14:05.303 --> 01:14:07.937
You're having some
differences of opinion.

01:14:08.039 --> 01:14:10.106
We're deadlocked.

01:14:12.723 --> 01:14:15.321
No you're not. I don't like that word.

01:14:15.321 --> 01:14:17.121
I'm not going to let you use it.

01:14:17.223 --> 01:14:19.619
Someone's holding out. You keep talking.

01:14:19.618 --> 01:14:20.617
Not gonna happen.

01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:22.595
Sure it will. What's the count?

01:14:22.594 --> 01:14:24.894
Six to six.

01:14:26.931 --> 01:14:28.528
And it's not gonna change.

01:14:30.235 --> 01:14:32.978
So, I'm sorry, Your Honor,

01:14:33.605 --> 01:14:34.771
but we're done.

01:14:44.005 --> 01:14:45.605
Thank you for your service.

01:14:45.707 --> 01:14:47.640
The jury is dismissed.

01:14:57.403 --> 01:15:00.091
So, Mrs. Weiss, what's your pleasure?

01:15:00.622 --> 01:15:03.369
Shall we impanel a new jury for retrial?

01:15:03.369 --> 01:15:04.969
Say, next week?

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:22.082
No, Your Honor.

01:15:22.247 --> 01:15:25.199
My office declines to prosecute further.

01:15:29.379 --> 01:15:30.667
You're free.

01:15:34.504 --> 01:15:36.145
Free to go home.

01:16:41.179 --> 01:16:43.846
As per usual, I see some old faces.

01:16:45.528 --> 01:16:47.695
Glad you learned your lesson.

01:16:48.086 --> 01:16:50.665
Now for the freshmen,
I'll keep it simple.

01:16:51.499 --> 01:16:53.394
You get told to do something, you do it.

01:16:53.395 --> 01:16:55.329
Gate! You lay a finger on any of us,

01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:56.775
we break out the riot gear,

01:16:56.775 --> 01:16:58.321
we put you in the fucking hospital,

01:16:58.321 --> 01:16:59.920
and we add another charge.

01:17:20.076 --> 01:17:21.709
Come on.

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:37.916
Come on.

01:17:40.997 --> 01:17:41.996
Come on.

01:17:42.098 --> 01:17:43.898
Come on!

01:17:49.788 --> 01:17:51.169
Your pay.

01:17:51.723 --> 01:17:53.456
Metro Card, one ride.

01:17:54.993 --> 01:17:56.011
Wait a second.

01:17:57.093 --> 01:17:58.594
He left this for you.

01:19:48.559 --> 01:19:50.960
NYU campus security.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.495
So, back in uniform.

01:19:54.051 --> 01:19:55.216
Sort of.

01:19:55.318 --> 01:19:58.385
You sure you wouldn't
rather slit your wrists?

01:19:58.487 --> 01:20:00.057
It's a job.

01:20:01.006 --> 01:20:03.180
I got a job for you.

01:20:09.689 --> 01:20:11.705
Let's go get him.

01:21:03.903 --> 01:21:05.302
It's hot.

01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:11.995
Anything you want to do tonight?

01:21:12.711 --> 01:21:14.428
Go out, see your friends?

01:21:14.631 --> 01:21:15.950
You should. It's fine.

01:21:16.689 --> 01:21:18.426
Nah, this is fine.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.147
Okay.

01:21:42.994 --> 01:21:46.862
I spent a lot of time sitting
on this bed when you were gone.

01:21:50.543 --> 01:21:52.643
I'm so happy you're home.

01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:56.856
You thought I killed her.

01:21:57.768 --> 01:21:59.267
Never.

01:22:04.761 --> 01:22:06.327
Okay, Mom.

01:22:56.022 --> 01:23:00.018
So, right now at the 21st
Precinct, there's someone in the pen.

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:04.522
They'll take him down to
The Tombs, to court, to Rikers.

01:23:04.547 --> 01:23:06.614
Meanwhile, there's
someone else in the pen.

01:23:06.613 --> 01:23:10.278
Tomorrow someone else,
the next day someone else.

01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:13.112
No one's even
thinking about you anymore.

01:23:13.994 --> 01:23:15.863
Except everybody here.

01:23:16.579 --> 01:23:17.883
So what?

01:23:20.318 --> 01:23:23.353
People stare at me
every day like I got leprosy.

01:23:23.688 --> 01:23:25.884
They don't want to be anywhere near me.

01:23:25.909 --> 01:23:27.314
I repulse them.

01:24:02.542 --> 01:24:05.538
See? You learned something in there.

01:24:10.134 --> 01:24:12.435
Everyone's got a cross to bear, Naz.

01:24:12.696 --> 01:24:14.396
Pardon the expression,

01:24:15.665 --> 01:24:16.926
fuck 'em all.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.708
Live your life.

01:24:23.682 --> 01:24:26.251
Thank you for what you did for me.

01:24:27.376 --> 01:24:28.965
Don't mention it.

01:25:16.808 --> 01:25:19.042
Yo, you got that?

01:25:19.518 --> 01:25:20.750
I got that.

01:25:21.613 --> 01:25:22.645
All right.

01:27:14.081 --> 01:27:15.547
<i>Four days later,</i>

01:27:15.649 --> 01:27:18.317
<i>the CSI team enters
Patty and JR's bedroom,</i>

01:27:18.342 --> 01:27:21.404
<i>one of the last places Patty
was seen before she vanished.</i>

01:27:21.404 --> 01:27:25.807
<i>They notice several stained indentations

01:27:25.909 --> 01:27:27.809
<i>and begin their testing with luminol,</i>

01:27:27.911 --> 01:27:31.079
<i>a chemical used to indicate
the possible presence of blood.</i>

01:27:38.002 --> 01:27:39.361
Yeah?

01:27:42.733 --> 01:27:45.595
Let me stop you.
Whatever you did or you didn't do,

01:27:45.595 --> 01:27:48.329
it's 250 bucks, cash only.

01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:50.965
No credit cards or personal checks.

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:56.928
Okay. Sit tight, don't talk to anybody.

01:27:56.928 --> 01:27:58.627
I'll be down there in a little while.

01:27:59.421 --> 01:28:01.021
You're gonna be fine.

01:28:08.606 --> 01:28:12.274
<i>Beautiful animals suffer every day.</i>

01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:17.336
<i>They live in squalor,</i>

01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:20.615
<i>with no food, no shelter,</i>

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.740
<i>and no love.</i>

01:28:32.155 --> 01:28:34.155
<i>These are the forgotten ones,</i>

01:28:34.257 --> 01:28:37.091
<i>loving animals who are abused</i>

01:28:37.193 --> 01:28:38.960
<i>and neglected,</i>

01:28:39.062 --> 01:28:42.576
<i>suffering all alone and living in fear.</i>

01:28:42.601 --> 01:28:44.401
<i>Please, don't forget them.</i>

01:28:44.634 --> 01:28:47.501
<i>Reach out and tell that animal</i>

01:28:47.526 --> 01:28:49.141
<i>you'll be there.</i>

01:28:49.619 --> 01:28:52.595
<i>Go online or call now.</i>
