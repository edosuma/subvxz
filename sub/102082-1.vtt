00:01.000 --> 00:02.960
VOICEOVER: Previously on Harrow...

00:02.960 --> 00:04.760
Fern, I'm sorry.

00:04.760 --> 00:06.960
I have to stay.
Screw you, Dad.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.160
Can I please see you?
Make sure you're OK?

00:09.160 --> 00:12.200
I'm OK.
You abused my little girl.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.120
She knew what she wanted.
I'm so sorry.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.440
He said he'd hurt Mum.
I wanted to tell you,

00:17.440 --> 00:20.320
whatever you choose, I'll be here.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.240
So Fern let you win?

00:22.240 --> 00:25.520
Don't let her down, because if you
do I will put you on a slab myself.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.000
Jack, were you ever tempted?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.080
To falsify evidence?

00:30.080 --> 00:32.280
(GUNSHOT)
Francis Chester.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.600
He was the man who shot me.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.520
MAN: I will take away
everything that you hold dear.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.880
Dr Daniel Harrow is to be struck
immediately from the register.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.880
It's my fault all this
happened to you.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.840
Max, you can't leave.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.040
I can't stay.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.240
Where's Fern?
We have to find her.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.400
(MAN ROARS)
Get off him!

00:50.400 --> 00:53.800
I've done what you want to do,
and it's always there.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.320
I don't want that for you.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.000
Is it over?
Yes, it's over.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.920
You do understand I'm on leave
at the moment?

01:03.920 --> 01:06.240
This young man was found dead
about an hour ago.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.720
What's it got to do with me?
Found his passport in his pocket.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.400
Your name is down as
his emergency contact.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.600
And there was a note.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.120
He claimed he was your son.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.120
(SIGHS)

02:59.120 --> 03:01.120
And the note?

03:01.120 --> 03:03.800
Ah, fingerprint team's
almost done with it.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.160
I'll let you have a look at it
before we send it to Scientific.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.640
Do you know what he
was doing up there?

03:08.640 --> 03:09.960
Not yet.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.960
Do you know how he fell?
No.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.760
Was he alone?

03:16.760 --> 03:20.360
Well, we don't know.
You're like the anti-encyclopedia.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.280
And that?

03:25.640 --> 03:28.320
Well, apparently it wasn't
recording in the hour or so

03:28.320 --> 03:30.760
that he arrived and fell.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.600
Switched off. You don't think
THAT'S a coincidence?

03:34.600 --> 03:37.000
We're looking into it, mate.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.040
There was a car outside.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.000
It was towed before
the body was found.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.920
Reported stolen.
It's at the compound.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.560
We're checking for prints.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.600
(SIGHS)

03:53.360 --> 03:55.640
Were you aware that you had a son?

03:58.840 --> 04:01.600
It's complicated.
WOMAN: Senior Sergeant?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.080
Ta.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.880
OK, look, I'll need this back
once you're finished with it.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.000
And, you know, I'll have
a few more questions.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.440
What does it say?

04:21.960 --> 04:23.640
"Dad.

04:23.640 --> 04:27.960
"I wanted to see you so much
but I couldn't find a way.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.320
"I found you had your own family
and your own life,

04:30.320 --> 04:32.560
"so I think it's better if
I don't complicate things.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.920
"I'd love to have known you.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.400
"Signed, J."

04:50.000 --> 04:51.640
Straight on.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.560
Height and weight, then into CT.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.920
Ah, Daniel, you know
you can't be doing this.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.600
Well, you can't,
you're still being supervised.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.000
I can if I'm supervised,
but not by you.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.520
Why, because I'm on leave?
Because you're next of kin.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.560
Well, I'm here and we don't
have a manager to say otherwise.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.840
Fairley's having a day off.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.760
Harrow...what are you doing?

05:14.760 --> 05:17.280
Measuring a deceased
in preparation for a post-mortem.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.160
This is not right.
THIS is not right.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.680
Did you spray those on?

05:23.840 --> 05:26.000
I came straight from rehearsals
when I heard.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.520
Harrow, if this is your son,
you cannot be involved in the PM.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.800
We don't know if he is or not.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.600
The PM is to establish
facts objectively.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.440
And I'm not capable
of being objective?

05:36.440 --> 05:37.880
Not in a situation like this.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.440
And how would you know?
Do you have children?

05:41.560 --> 05:43.640
Right, I think you should go now.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.240
Dr Harrow?
I'm not leaving him.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.320
You have to and you know it.
I'm not going.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.000
Harrow.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.960
The Deputy Coroner is here for you.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.120
I've been briefed.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.440
I'm very sorry.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.240
And you understand why Doctors
Fairley and Molyneaux

06:12.240 --> 06:13.400
will conduct the PM?

06:15.520 --> 06:16.520
Yeah.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.320
And I know you're not going
sailing the Coral Sea

06:22.320 --> 06:26.160
while this is unfolding, so you can
consider your suspension lifted,

06:26.160 --> 06:28.520
on the strict condition

06:28.520 --> 06:31.560
you give no interference
to Lyle and Grace.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.920
I am to be fed twice a day
and you need to change my litter.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.640
Yeah, not really into cats.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.520
Hey, come on,
at least you can still work.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.560
Yeah.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.360
Ah, but before you do...

06:55.120 --> 06:56.480
..um...

06:58.760 --> 07:01.440
..can you help me get in touch
with your son's mother?

07:10.840 --> 07:12.880
We met in London,

07:12.880 --> 07:16.280
when I was in my
last year of post-grad.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.600
Right, so she was a student, too?

07:19.840 --> 07:22.880
No, she worked part-time
in a Tesco,

07:22.880 --> 07:24.920
around the corner from
the teaching hospital.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.120
(SIGHS) Tanya.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.000
I don't know what she
saw in me, either.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.400
I was a doctor, she ran a checkout.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.840
I drank coffee and
studied till midnight

07:39.840 --> 07:42.680
and she drank ouzo
and painted till dawn.

07:44.240 --> 07:49.040
She had tattoos, and I hated
needles, but we worked.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.800
You know, we really worked.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.440
Until I graduated and got offered
a job back here under Jack Twine.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.480
And Tanya came with you?
Yeah.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.760
She tried to find work

08:03.760 --> 08:07.840
while I tried to prove myself
working 15-, 16-hour days

08:07.840 --> 08:09.800
six, seven days a week.

08:12.080 --> 08:16.800
She had no family, no friends
and most of the time...no me.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.400
Then about three months in...

08:22.080 --> 08:23.680
..she told me two things.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.280
She was pregnant and
that she was going home.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.560
Alone.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.600
I tried ringing, I tried writing.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.520
I even tried sending money.

08:38.200 --> 08:43.000
I didn't even know if Tanya
had a boy or a girl,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.760
or if she'd had it at all.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.200
(SIGHS) I even went over
to try and find her.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.880
Well, what about her family?
Ah, she wasn't close.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.360
When I did talk to them,
they told me that I should just

08:54.360 --> 08:56.720
go back and live my own life.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.520
And I'm ashamed to say that I did.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.720
I met Steph,

09:01.720 --> 09:04.080
got married, we had Fern.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.720
But I never found the way,
I never found the courage

09:09.720 --> 09:11.880
to tell them that I might have
another child somewhere.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.800
You should have.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.160
Look, is it OK if I borrow these
just for the addresses?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.960
Yeah, of course.
Go, mate, go.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.680
Fern...I don't know how much
you heard...

09:28.680 --> 09:30.400
Plenty for one night.
Listen...

09:30.400 --> 09:31.680
I can't, Dad.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.400
I would have at any
time up until now.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.960
Look, I know it's no way
to find out.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.360
No, it's not.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.800
Every time I think that we're good,

09:42.800 --> 09:45.520
that all the secrets are out,
you just magic up another one.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.640
A half-brother now?
Oh, Fern.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.720
Just tell me.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.000
Where is he now?

09:57.080 --> 09:58.480
In the morgue.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.480
Fern.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.640
Vente, half full-cream,
half non-fat, split quad shots,

10:26.640 --> 10:30.240
two decaf, two regular,
no foam latte with whipped cream,

10:30.240 --> 10:33.880
coconut sugar and a touch
of vanilla essence.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.640
You forgot the nutmeg.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.360
They were out of nutmeg.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.360
And a green tea.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.520
Oh, well, I can make
green tea in the kitchen.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.240
Yeah.

10:47.560 --> 10:48.840
PM done?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.600
I'm going to apologise to
the rest of the cast

10:52.600 --> 10:54.880
of Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.680
Grace might take you through
what we found.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.880
(DOOR CLOSES)

11:20.960 --> 11:22.520
Acute subdural haematoma?

11:24.480 --> 11:27.640
And intrusion into the central
sulcus by skull fragments.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.600
Also a total break
between his C3, C4 vertebra.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.640
He would have died quickly.
Probably.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.320
Hopefully.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.800
Is there anything to
explain why he fell?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.520
A fight? Drugs? Anything?

11:41.520 --> 11:45.200
No signs of struggle.
We're waiting on his tox reports.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.720
What kind of a father
meets his son like this?

11:55.760 --> 11:57.360
Did you even know he was here?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.000
I didn't even know what
his voice sounded like.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.000
Rattus norvegicus domestica.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.160
Somewhat outside my usual duties,

12:31.160 --> 12:34.200
seeing it is both
an animal and alive.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.160
So, something smelled a rat?

12:36.160 --> 12:38.600
Jogger's dog.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.640
So early morning jogger,

12:40.640 --> 12:43.600
Fido goes nuts,
chases after the rat.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.120
Jogger chases after Fido
and finds him.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.040
Peter Craig Morrow.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.440
Was he sleeping rough?
Long-term homeless.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.240
His usual haunt was about
half a click that way.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.080
And apparently the rat was his pet.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.440
Yeah, we found a fixed blade
knife close by.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.240
We're printing and testing it.
Wasn't stabbed here.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.280
Joggers have tracked the blood
in both directions.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.960
Any witnesses?
No.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.640
We're checking council
security cameras,

13:16.640 --> 13:19.520
but the nearest one is on the other
side of that park over there.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.080
Was it a robbery?
Still had his wallet with $12 in it.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.760
I doubt he had any more
worth taking.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.520
Does Morrow have any friends?

13:33.520 --> 13:36.520
Anyone who might know
what happened to him?

13:36.520 --> 13:38.640
Well, the homeless community
isn't really saying much

13:38.640 --> 13:40.960
'cause we're not in their good books
at the moment.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.360
There's been a number of assaults
on rough sleepers lately,

13:43.360 --> 13:46.280
and apparently
we're not doing enough.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.120
Alright.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.520
I'll, uh...I'll see
what I can find out.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.240
OK.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.760
What about his rat?

13:59.160 --> 14:01.960
Oh, we'll take it to the nearest
vet, have it destroyed.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.720
WOMAN: Why me?
Why not?

14:06.720 --> 14:08.000
Because I hate rats.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.320
You might not have a job
without rats.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.080
They make excellent models
for medical research.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.840
Almost every human gene
associated with diseases

14:15.840 --> 14:17.640
has a counterpart
in the rat genome.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.800
I usually just poison
the rat genome.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.400
How did you get through
nursing school?

14:21.400 --> 14:24.320
Blackmail.
Fine, I'll keep it in my office.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.000
Well, it should have
plenty of company there.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.240
This is the homeless guy?
His name was Peter Morrow.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.280
Why?
His daughter's on the way in.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.680
Oh, Dad.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.520
That's Peter Craig Morrow?

14:42.520 --> 14:45.360
Yes. Can I go in and see him?

14:45.360 --> 14:46.840
Not yet.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.440
We are still to conduct
our examination,

14:49.440 --> 14:53.640
but after that you can take as
much time with him as you need.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.680
Where's Maestro?
What?

14:59.680 --> 15:02.520
Dad's pet rat Maestro.
They were inseparable.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.840
Maestro, right. He's in my office.
Would you like him?

15:05.840 --> 15:08.800
I just wanted to make
sure it was OK.

15:10.120 --> 15:13.520
Emily, did you have much
to do with your father?

15:13.520 --> 15:16.480
I tried to see him
every fortnight or so.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.760
Do you know who did this?

15:20.760 --> 15:22.600
We're looking into it.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.360
How would you describe
your father's personality?

15:28.760 --> 15:30.840
Dad was the loveliest man.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.960
Gentle, sweet.
Everyone liked Dad and Maestro.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.560
Of course the police always
tried to shift him on.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.840
But he kept going back.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.480
He was found a long way
from him usual corner.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.320
Do you have any idea why?

15:46.320 --> 15:50.200
I have no idea why Dad did
any of the things that he did.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.240
I tried to get him to
move in with me, but...

15:57.200 --> 15:59.240
..but I thought he was OK, until...

16:02.200 --> 16:03.560
What?

16:03.560 --> 16:07.680
About a year ago,
Dad kind of...changed.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.400
Changed how?

16:09.400 --> 16:11.800
Did he become aggressive? Violent?

16:11.800 --> 16:16.920
No. Dad was still really nice to me,
but he would say,

16:16.920 --> 16:19.000
"You're sweet,
but where's the real Emily?"

16:20.480 --> 16:22.240
He thought I was an impostor.

16:23.480 --> 16:27.120
And it wasn't just me.
It was his friends, too, like Di.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.880
Di?

16:28.880 --> 16:31.000
Di and Dad were good mates,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.760
but even she wasn't
the real Di, apparently.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.200
Do you know any more about Di?
Where we could find her?

16:39.040 --> 16:42.560
Emily, why was your father homeless?

16:44.040 --> 16:45.520
I don't know.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.560
He wasn't a drunk or ill.

16:49.560 --> 16:53.320
Don't get me wrong, he didn't
like being on the streets.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.760
But he just disliked
being indoors more.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.000
Meant he couldn't keep a job,
or a family.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.440
And now someone's killed him.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.160
I...I should have been there.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.080
I should have tried harder.

17:09.080 --> 17:12.560
Emily...we WILL find who did this.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.920
(LIFT BELL DINGS)

17:25.800 --> 17:28.760
It is not your place
to promise to find a killer.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.600
No, it's yours.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.200
And I didn't promise
because we might not.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.800
We've got no witnesses,
no suspects, no motive.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.920
You have the weapon.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.000
Yeah, and the only prints
on it are the victim's.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.720
WOMAN: He didn't stab himself.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.280
No. No, he didn't.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.760
But I don't think he provoked it,
either.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.800
Hi.

17:51.960 --> 17:52.960
Hi.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.360
I have not done a death like this
before, so do you think I can...

17:55.360 --> 17:57.120
Of course.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.520
Are you OK?

18:02.520 --> 18:05.040
Absolutely.
Have you heard about the rat?

18:05.040 --> 18:08.160
It would fit right in in his office.
That's what I said.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.040
Here are his hospital records.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.000
He didn't like being indoors.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.560
Claustrophobic?
Apparently.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.120
What's that got to do
with the cause of death?

18:17.120 --> 18:19.400
Maybe nothing. Ready?

18:26.560 --> 18:28.760
His teeth are surprisingly good.

18:28.760 --> 18:32.080
He had a toothbrush, comb, soap.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.480
He tried to look after himself.
But look at this.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.280
Abrasions.

18:38.280 --> 18:41.080
They go distinctly side to side.

18:41.080 --> 18:45.120
As if he was trying to turn his head
but was held down by someone.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.640
Someone heavy or strong.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.840
This is quite recent.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.480
Yes, it wasn't from this attack.
It's healed.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.960
Healed badly. No stitch marks.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.240
Less than 12 months old.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.920
There's no mention
in his hospital records.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.360
Is the CT ready?

19:06.360 --> 19:07.880
(BEEPING)

19:07.880 --> 19:10.400
Lesions on the cerebral cortex,

19:10.400 --> 19:12.440
directly beneath
that external scarring.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.800
His daughter said he had a
personality change about a year ago.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.960
Began accusing her and others
of being impostors.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.040
You know there are reports

19:20.040 --> 19:21.960
that Capgras syndrome is
caused by brain injury.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.920
And what exactly has this got to do
with cause of death?

19:24.920 --> 19:27.280
Again, maybe nothing.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.800
Is the scan of that knife uploaded?

19:30.880 --> 19:31.920
Yes.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.440
Narrow point, thick spine,

19:35.440 --> 19:38.200
tapering off to
a hollow ground edge.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.200
Let's see.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.400
Well, that's consistent
with the blade width.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.360
And depth.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.880
But he went in to the hilt.
That took force.

19:47.880 --> 19:52.200
But look at the angles
of these blade entries.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.680
All consistent in this almost
east-west alignment,

19:55.680 --> 20:01.200
as if the attacker was at his side,
gripping the knife...like this.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.960
There's a large contusion here
on the back of his left leg.

20:03.960 --> 20:08.000
Hmm, same on his left elbow
and forearm.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.240
Well, like you said,
someone held him down,

20:10.240 --> 20:12.520
pinned his arm and his leg.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.760
While the attacker drove the knife
into him again and again.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.480
Vicious.
Angry.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.800
Like wounds you'd inflict on
someone you desperately hated.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.680
But he was a sweet man
whom everyone loved.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.000
So why was he stabbed seven times,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.480
so far from the corner
he called home?

20:34.160 --> 20:35.680
Eight times.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.680
Hmm, this one's not deep.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.520
But it would have bled a bit.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.120
And, look, it's straight up and down.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.080
So the blade was held like this?

20:51.080 --> 20:54.440
Suggesting that both the victim
and the stabber were on their feet.

20:56.280 --> 21:00.600
The wound to the chest is consistent
with the same knife.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.880
But a shallow penetration
into soft tissue.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.320
I don't get it.
A light jab to the chest.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.560
Vicious wounds to the hilt
in the back.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.720
It's almost like...
Two different people.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.840
They cleaned it up.
So this is where it happened.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.280
So held down here
and brutally murdered.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.920
What are you doing?

21:27.920 --> 21:29.440
Aha.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.880
We know that Morrow could only crawl

21:36.880 --> 21:38.480
after the stab wounds
to his back, right?

21:38.480 --> 21:40.720
Mm-hm.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.400
So these droplets are...

21:43.400 --> 21:46.880
Are from before he was pinned down.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.080
So the small wound to his chest.
Mm-hm.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.640
Oh.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.640
Here's where it ends?

22:01.640 --> 22:03.480
Or, really, where it began.

22:04.480 --> 22:10.200
So, around here, Mr Morrow
gets a shallow stab.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.880
Bleeding, he heads that way,

22:15.880 --> 22:18.560
where he's held down
by someone strong.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.720
And stabbed viciously.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.520
It does sound like
two different attackers.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.280
We should swab that blood.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.840
Excuse me?

22:38.840 --> 22:40.640
Excuse me, hello?

22:40.640 --> 22:43.000
Mind my stuff.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.360
Excuse me.
I'm not talking to you again.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.640
You guys have already given me
the third degree.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.440
Look, I'm not the police.
I'm with the Coroner.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.920
I saw you at the crime scene.
You knew Peter Morrow.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.680
I know he's dead, that's all I know.
He was murdered.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.560
I didn't do it!
OK, OK, OK, OK.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.200
But I want to find who did.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.840
Some people who sleep rough

23:06.840 --> 23:08.800
carry something to
protect themselves.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.360
Did Mr Morrow carry a knife?

23:16.120 --> 23:17.720
Wood handle, brass pommel?

23:17.720 --> 23:20.640
Yeah, it seems it did him
more harm than good.

23:20.640 --> 23:25.000
He was a long way
from his normal corner.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.120
Any idea why?
Nuh.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.360
He'd been acting a bit odd
for a while, though.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.560
Like thinking his friends
were impostors?

23:34.560 --> 23:36.280
You and Di?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.280
This is Di, right?

23:43.360 --> 23:44.560
Yeah.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.840
She hasn't spoken to the police,
though.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.320
Did she know Morrow
carried a knife, too?

23:52.440 --> 23:53.760
Di didn't kill Pete.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.200
Then why won't she talk
to the police?

23:57.960 --> 24:02.280
Look, Morrow had two kinds
of stab wounds, one here...

24:02.280 --> 24:04.520
Listen, I don't know
what she did or didn't do,

24:04.520 --> 24:08.160
but what you guy have to start doing
instead of accusing us,

24:08.160 --> 24:09.640
is to start helping us.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.200
We're not the problem.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.360
So please just leave
Di alone, alright?

24:14.360 --> 24:15.800
Alright?

24:16.920 --> 24:19.040
What the hell were you doing?

24:19.040 --> 24:21.480
You shouldn't be talking
to potential witnesses.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.240
But he said he'd already
been questioned.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.200
Well, did he mention anyone else?

24:26.200 --> 24:28.800
We discussed Morrow's friend Di.
Why?

24:31.520 --> 24:33.680
This is from the other side
of the park,

24:33.680 --> 24:36.400
about 200 metres from where
Mr Morrow was stabbed.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.560
Di Baverstock.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.920
Friend of Peter Morrow's.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.200
Seen hurrying from the path
where Mr Morrow was stabbed.

24:49.200 --> 24:52.080
But stabbed two different ways.

24:52.080 --> 24:55.160
What if she was only responsible
for that light jab?

24:55.160 --> 24:57.640
Look at her. Tell me she doesn't
look scared and guilty.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.200
But why would she viciously
murder her friend?

25:00.200 --> 25:02.840
Lovers' quarrel.
You heard his daughter.

25:02.840 --> 25:06.080
He hadn't been close to anyone
since he acquired that brain injury.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.760
Well, there you go. If he wasn't
himself, who knows what he did?

25:08.760 --> 25:10.520
But I just don't see...
No, no, no.

25:10.520 --> 25:14.320
Harrow, we have Ms Baverstock at
the right time at the right place.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.440
She knew the victim.
She knew he had a knife.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.560
OK? I've issued a POI.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.240
Have you heard anything
from the UK about Tanya?

25:26.240 --> 25:28.600
Oh, there's a lot of
addresses to check.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.800
You know, it's been
more than 20 years.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.680
She may have married, remarried,
changed her surname.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.840
It's going to take a bit of time.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.800
And the car you found
at the shipyard, was it his?

25:38.800 --> 25:41.200
Ah, it belonged to a stockbroking
firm in the city.

25:41.200 --> 25:45.040
It was a company vehicle,
so, you know, lots of prints.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.760
But among them were
some matching your son's.

25:50.760 --> 25:54.120
You think he stole it?
Well, we don't know yet.

25:54.120 --> 25:58.680
Look, Harrow, I know you want
answers and we'll find them.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.320
But just leave things
with us for now.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.280

You don't check your
voicemail, do you?

Job interview.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.800
What, she's thinking of moving?
I think it's past thinking.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.160
And Fern?

28:18.160 --> 28:20.400
Trying out for a new cleaning firm.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.320
I don't think she's happy with you.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.360
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.400
You had a boy.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.160
I'm sorry.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.400
I'm not going to ask if you're OK,
because you can't be.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.520
How do you know what it's like?

29:07.720 --> 29:09.000
Well...

29:16.440 --> 29:18.080
I had a boy, too.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.560
Yeah, I was 17.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.960
My girlfriend was 16,
and he...he...

29:28.960 --> 29:32.000
..he made it to 15 weeks.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.040
Then there was no heartbeat.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.440
It broke us.

29:39.520 --> 29:44.360
We were angry at the world,
heartbroken at the world.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.160
But we just sent it at each other.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.240
And I'm so ashamed.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.560
I should have been there for her.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.640
But I was 17.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.480
How old were you?

30:05.760 --> 30:07.080
23.

30:11.600 --> 30:15.400
I can't go back,
but I can be here now.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.400
For the one in my life now.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.280
For Fern.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.800
Ask Fern to call me.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.920
I'll ask.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.880
But a dead brother?

30:36.160 --> 30:37.640
That's a lot to talk about.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.240
(RAT SNEEZES)

31:40.800 --> 31:42.600
Are you missing your owner?

31:46.880 --> 31:48.880
Are you thinking he's coming back?

31:50.040 --> 31:51.480
I'm sorry, he's not.

31:52.960 --> 31:53.960
He's gone.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.880
(SIGHS) But at least
you got to spend time.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.680
(RAT SNEEZES)

32:21.040 --> 32:22.920
Why aren't you eating?

32:22.920 --> 32:25.840
How bad is ratbite fever?

32:25.840 --> 32:28.320
For the rat or the one bitten?

32:28.320 --> 32:29.880
Let's go with column B.

32:29.880 --> 32:33.480
Well, fever, rash, vomiting
and, if untreated,

32:33.480 --> 32:36.640
could progress to brain infection
and heart failure.

32:38.800 --> 32:42.680
But we'll check Maestro after...

32:45.360 --> 32:47.760
..we check this.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.840
Oh, Peter Morrow
was covered in blood.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.080
That's probably his.
Maybe.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.640
There's only one way to find out.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.480
Now, Mr Morrow was...
B negative.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.920
And the blood on the rat?

33:03.160 --> 33:04.360
O positive.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.440
Someone else's blood?
Mm.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.200
You think the rat bit his attacker?

33:09.200 --> 33:10.400
I know.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.640
But if it did, and it does
have ratbite fever,

33:13.640 --> 33:16.480
that person might be
feeling very ill.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.280
Di Baverstock.

33:19.280 --> 33:21.720
So, middle-aged woman
with flu-like symptoms.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.240
Mm. Headache, nausea, joint pain.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.320
Can you narrow it down?

33:26.320 --> 33:28.880
She'd also have an animal wound.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.240
Dog? Cat?
Rat.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.960
No middle-aged women.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.800
Mm. Thanks, Jean.

33:40.520 --> 33:45.360
But last night a 16-year-old boy
presented with flu symptoms,

33:45.360 --> 33:48.760
with a male friend who revealed
he'd been bitten by something.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.040
Was he treated?

33:52.040 --> 33:53.880
For some reason they left
before treatment.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.040
Did they get his details?

33:59.440 --> 34:02.520
MAN: (SHOUTS) Hey, sit down
and eat your breakfast!

34:02.520 --> 34:05.040
Sit down! What are YOU doing?
Get yourself ready.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.760
You little shit!

34:06.760 --> 34:09.720
Sit down now or I'll give
you something to cry about!

34:09.720 --> 34:11.720
And where do you think
you're going?!

34:11.720 --> 34:13.320
(DOOR SLAMS)

34:17.480 --> 34:19.400
If you're selling something,
now's not a great time.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.800
Ah, no, I'm not. I...

34:21.800 --> 34:24.120
What's up?

34:24.120 --> 34:25.920
Yes, my name's Dr Daniel Harrow.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.400
Is your boy Jordy home?

34:28.400 --> 34:31.040
Her boy. Why?

34:34.680 --> 34:38.200
Does he have stomach pains?
Muscle aches? A fever?

34:45.280 --> 34:47.120
Hey, mate.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.600
What have you been up to, hey?
Nothing.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.120
Well, this is Doctor...
Harrow.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.760
I won't be a minute.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.800
Yeah, well we gotta bounce
in a minute, so...

35:07.720 --> 35:10.480
Did, um...Mum call you?

35:10.480 --> 35:11.920
No.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.840
I'm a doctor of pathology.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.360
I deal with dead people.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.040
(SIGHS)
What do you want?

35:26.640 --> 35:28.680
That rat bite is infected.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.360
You need to go back to hospital.

35:30.360 --> 35:31.720
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:31.720 --> 35:32.920
Don't.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.080
Don't.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.320
I know what you did, Jordy.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.400
The man you killed was named
Peter Morrow.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.640
He was bleeding, wasn't he,
when you came across him?

35:53.200 --> 35:54.480
From here.

35:58.600 --> 36:01.200
Were you alone, or
were you with your friend

36:01.200 --> 36:02.600
who took you to hospital?

36:10.160 --> 36:11.160
(SIGHS)

36:14.720 --> 36:16.000
So...

36:17.960 --> 36:20.600
..you saw a bleeding homeless man.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.280
You could have left him alone.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.720
You could have offered to help
but you'd had a shit day.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.320
This?

36:33.600 --> 36:34.960
So you hassled him.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.200
You old useless prick.
Stay away.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.880
Maybe he waved his knife at you,

36:38.880 --> 36:42.960
but that was the one thing that
Mr Morrow shouldn't have done.

36:44.920 --> 36:45.960
Provoked you.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.400
And you lost it.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.600
You pinned him down.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.440
You grabbed his knife
and you stabbed him.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.680
What I didn't understand was why.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.920
But now I think I do.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.000
Your stepfather.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.400
He hits you.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.000
Humiliates you, hurts your mother

37:28.000 --> 37:29.960
and you can't fight back.

37:29.960 --> 37:35.000
And so your anger just
builds and builds

37:35.000 --> 37:40.760
until this homeless old man waves
his knife at you and you snap.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.480
And you stab and you stab
again and again,

37:46.480 --> 37:48.240
until you see what you've done.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.240
And then his rat.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.160
Did it come at you?

38:04.160 --> 38:06.960
It was...it was just there.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.400
And it bit you.

38:18.520 --> 38:22.080
One of you wiped the fingerprints
off the knife and you ran away.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.080
He shouldn't have waved that knife.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.760
No.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.120
You should have helped him.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.520
But instead you killed him.

39:01.360 --> 39:03.640
I've called the police.
They're on their way.

39:05.240 --> 39:08.560
I wanted to give you a chance
to explain things to your family

39:08.560 --> 39:10.160
before you're arrested.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.360
NICHOLS: A random stabbing.

39:31.320 --> 39:32.960
It wasn't random.

39:34.320 --> 39:35.600
It was inevitable.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.920
He's the one Jordy wanted to hurt.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.320
But it's an unfortunate human trait

39:42.320 --> 39:46.000
that at our worst moments,
we usually punch down.

39:47.880 --> 39:51.200
I guess that means your
homeless woman's off the hook.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.720
Only she doesn't know it yet.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.200
Di, it's me. Hey.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.840
Pete started going funny
about a year ago.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.240
It was after he got hit
by some drunk idiots.

40:21.240 --> 40:24.480
We found brain damage that
would explain those changes.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.120
Well, he got worse,

40:27.120 --> 40:29.040
until the only thing
he trusted was Maestro.

40:30.080 --> 40:33.200
And then...and then
a few nights ago,

40:33.200 --> 40:38.440
I heard Pete shouting that someone
had switched out Maestro.

40:38.440 --> 40:41.280
He had his knife.
He was gonna kill it.

40:41.280 --> 40:45.440
So I...I grabbed the knife
and Maestro and ran.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.480
Pete caught up
and he started grabbing at me.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.040
Like, I had the knife.

40:52.040 --> 40:55.480
I warned him to get away,
but he kept coming at me,

40:55.480 --> 40:57.120
and I got him.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.000
So I ran and I hid,

41:03.000 --> 41:06.960
and then Neil told me that...

41:06.960 --> 41:08.840
..that Peter had died.

41:10.480 --> 41:14.080
And I thought, "Oh, I've...
I've killed him."

41:41.320 --> 41:42.960
He looks good.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.560
This didn't have to happen.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.640
Why didn't he just move in with me?

41:50.640 --> 41:54.480
Did your father ever talk
about when he was a boy?

41:57.280 --> 41:59.120
I spoke to his friend Di.

42:00.760 --> 42:07.000
Your father didn't tell many people,
but he'd had a terrible childhood.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.160
He was locked in his bedroom
every night,

42:10.160 --> 42:13.320
waiting for his stepfather
to finish with his mother

42:13.320 --> 42:15.240
before coming in for him.

42:16.480 --> 42:20.120
I think that's why he couldn't stand
being in a room, any room, for long.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.880
Why didn't he tell me?

42:26.160 --> 42:28.080
Apparently, he was ashamed.

42:30.160 --> 42:33.160
Embarrassed that he
couldn't get over it.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.800
That he let you down.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.600
Oh...Dad.

42:50.560 --> 42:53.840
Someone has to take care of it
while it's on its medicine.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.200
I'm just surprised
that someone is you.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.400
(LAUGHS)

42:58.400 --> 43:01.440
Did you know that rats regulate
their body heat through their tails?

43:01.440 --> 43:03.120
And they have...
Of course you did.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.840
And they have bellybuttons

43:04.840 --> 43:06.720
and they can laugh,
and their teeth...

43:06.720 --> 43:08.080
Don't push it.

43:15.680 --> 43:18.600
(SPOON SCRAPES)

43:24.960 --> 43:26.960
Hi.
Hi.

43:26.960 --> 43:30.080
That's...my coffee mug.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.880
It's a nice one.

43:31.880 --> 43:34.840
Mm. Might you use another mug?

43:34.840 --> 43:37.960
I would, but they're all
in the dishwasher,

43:37.960 --> 43:40.280
which hasn't been put on.

43:40.280 --> 43:43.600
I did check the kitchen roster
to see who should have done that.

43:43.600 --> 43:46.600
Dr Harrow?
What the hell is going on?

43:47.680 --> 43:50.000
Harrow, what in the name of...

43:50.000 --> 43:51.520
Oh, hello.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.800
Hi.
What are you doing to my office?

44:00.160 --> 44:02.720
My bonsai. Is this your doing?

44:02.720 --> 44:04.840
No, but I wish it was.

44:04.840 --> 44:07.080
Well, if you didn't...
Uncle Lyle, have you...

44:07.080 --> 44:10.360
Oh, you found him.
Not me, this time.

44:10.360 --> 44:12.880
Oh.
Ah, good. You're all here.

44:15.080 --> 44:17.280
As you all know, the department
has been vetting

44:17.280 --> 44:21.760
a number of high-level candidates
to replace Maxine Pavich.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.280
I'm pleased to announce
one has been selected.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.760
Oh, here we go.

44:25.760 --> 44:28.720
Although not a pathologist...
Not a pathologist.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.800
What a disaster.
Fairley.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.600
..improving a number of
health organisations.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.000
So now we'll be wasting
valuable work time

44:35.000 --> 44:36.280
accounting for every paper towel.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.480
Fairley.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.640
Now to be more involved,
she's elected to centralise herself

44:40.640 --> 44:42.560
out of Dr Fairley's old office.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.160
Didn't even ask me.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.200
Just marched straight
into the Sudetenland...

44:46.200 --> 44:47.680
Fairley.
What?

44:47.680 --> 44:50.400
So it gives me great pleasure
to introduce

44:50.400 --> 44:54.000
QIFM's new manager
Renae Warrington.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.760
Excuse me, Dr Fairley.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.640
Dr Harrow, do you mind holding
that for me, please?

45:00.640 --> 45:02.840
Thank you, Doug.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.160
Hi, everyone.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.800
I am so excited to be here,
and I look forward to hearing

45:06.800 --> 45:09.720
about all the amazing work you do.

45:09.720 --> 45:13.520
But first, let me apologise
to Dr Fairley

45:13.520 --> 45:16.120
for taking over his office
without warning.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.720
I hope it's OK that you now get
Maxine's old office

45:18.720 --> 45:21.760
and a small budget to refurbish it.

45:21.760 --> 45:25.040
My apologies to Dr Fairley
extend to one other thing.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.680
I need you to take on more duties.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.840
Supervisory duties.
Of Doctor Molyneux?

45:30.840 --> 45:32.120
No.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.240
We think Dr Molyneux can be released
from her probationary period.

45:35.240 --> 45:37.920
You'll be supervising Dr Harrow.

45:41.920 --> 45:44.160
Fairley? Supervising me?

45:45.320 --> 45:47.680
I've been here just as long as him.
23 years.

45:47.680 --> 45:48.680
Exactly.

45:48.680 --> 45:51.760
Which means you're eligible
for early retirement.

45:51.760 --> 45:52.760
What are you saying?

45:52.760 --> 45:55.240
I'm saying Dr Fairley will
supervise your actions,

45:55.240 --> 45:57.360
and based on his report,
I will decide whether or not

45:57.360 --> 45:59.080
you'll be given that
retirement package.

45:59.080 --> 46:02.200
You mean fired.
Retired is a nicer word.

46:03.480 --> 46:06.520
I know Maxine Pavich extended
you a lot of latitude.

46:06.520 --> 46:09.080
That ends now.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.760
If you want to stay working here,

46:10.760 --> 46:13.800
you need to understand that
I will tolerate no more secrets.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.400
Hey.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.400
Hi.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.360
I'm sorry for being a jerk.
Which time?

46:42.440 --> 46:45.920
For the 'no children' thing.
Oh, that's OK.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.800
This must be the worst thing
in the world.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.000
What's that?
Ah, his tox results.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.480
No drugs, no alcohol.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.600
Nothing to explain why he fell?

46:58.600 --> 47:00.800
Well, only that note you read.

47:02.160 --> 47:03.640
Read like a suicide note.

47:06.760 --> 47:10.280
I'm not sure it's healthy
for you being in here.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.200
Where else should I go?

47:12.200 --> 47:14.200
Everything always comes back to here.

47:14.200 --> 47:17.760
All the good things in my life.
The bad.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.600
This is where my father came.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.920
Where I met my mentor whose
name was Jack, like his.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.560
Can't escape this place.

47:33.320 --> 47:35.720
Why don't you come
to my place tonight?

47:35.720 --> 47:38.440
Just friends. I'll cook.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.280
Don't be alone.
I think I'm better off alone.

48:06.360 --> 48:08.160
(PHONE RINGS)

48:12.480 --> 48:13.920
Can anyone get that?

48:15.480 --> 48:18.000
Hello?!
(RINGING CONTINUES)

48:20.000 --> 48:22.400
Queensland Institute
of Forensic Medicine.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.000
Hi, this is Mike from
Brisbane Medical Laboratories.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.640
I'm calling for Dr Fairley.

48:26.640 --> 48:29.080
Oh, he's not here.
Can I take a message?

48:29.080 --> 48:31.480
It's for a DNA ID he ordered.

48:31.480 --> 48:33.480
M4-1418?

48:33.480 --> 48:35.960
An unidentified body
from a shipyard.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.680
Yes, could you, uh, email
that to him, please,

48:40.680 --> 48:42.360
and I'll ask him to log on.

48:42.360 --> 48:44.000
Absolutely. Thanks for your help.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.840
Bless you, Fairley.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.200
(ALARM CHIRPS)
Dr Harrow.

50:01.560 --> 50:03.400
Have the DNA results come in?

50:07.320 --> 50:08.760
Who are you?

50:08.760 --> 50:10.240
I'm James.

50:16.440 --> 50:17.720
I'm your son.

50:21.400 --> 50:22.760
So...

50:22.760 --> 50:24.640
..the DNA results?

50:28.040 --> 50:30.640
Just back.
Then you have to keep them secret.

50:30.640 --> 50:32.480
For as long as you can.

50:34.600 --> 50:37.840
Why?
(HORN HONKS)

50:37.840 --> 50:40.680
Because there are people
that are after me.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.600
If they find out that
I'm alive, they'll...

50:44.600 --> 50:48.120
(SIREN WAILS)

50:49.600 --> 50:51.720
No, wait. James!

50:51.720 --> 50:53.200
James!

51:02.760 --> 51:04.680
VOICEOVER: Next on Harrow...

51:04.680 --> 51:07.880
If what he's telling me is true,
then I have to help him.

51:07.880 --> 51:10.720
What makes you so sure this guy is
your son? He could be anyone.

51:10.720 --> 51:11.920
Hi, Dad.

51:11.920 --> 51:14.360
You're here to find cuts
and my guess is

51:14.360 --> 51:15.680
someone's going to lose their job.

51:15.680 --> 51:18.600
We need to talk to you
about an email.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.160
What is this place anyway?

51:20.160 --> 51:22.160
Looks like a haunted house.

51:22.160 --> 51:24.200
Now, why would anyone drink blood?

51:24.200 --> 51:25.720
Do you believe in vampires?

51:26.960 --> 51:28.240
I'm a man of faith.

51:28.240 --> 51:31.640
Whoever did this genuinely believed
they were killing a vampire.
