00:04.805 --> 00:06.507
Ah! Ah!

00:06.507 --> 00:08.042
It's time
to say goodbye.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.646
Tonya.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.348
No serenade
this time?

00:20.088 --> 00:22.523
Donno?! No, no, no, no, no!
No, no.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.692
No.
Help!

00:29.763 --> 00:30.864
Is Emily with you?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.100
No, I-I
was calling to see

00:32.100 --> 00:33.267
if she was still
at the office.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.868
Something's not right.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.537
Where is my daughter?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.839
What is it?
Buck has them.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.188
Girls, it's time
to ditch this ride

00:54.188 --> 00:57.057

We're on it.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.018
...baby.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.286
No, I need to get through.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.487
Beau?
Ma'am, please.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.788
You can't go in there.
Oh, no.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.056
- I'm not leaving.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

02:36.056 --> 02:37.391
- I'm staying right here.
- It's okay.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.492
Oh, my God.
Alright. Okay.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.993
What's happening?

02:43.364 --> 02:44.565
I'm sorry.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.669
Hey. Hey.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.704
You need to know that Avery was
doing everything he could

02:50.704 --> 02:51.905
to fix this mistake of his, okay?

02:51.905 --> 02:53.341
He was trying
to save Emily.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.909
Where is she now?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.114
Beau?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.217
We think that Buck Barnes
has her.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.418
Oh.
Oh, my God.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.053
Hey, listen to me,

03:06.053 --> 03:07.388
I'm gonna find her.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.722
I'm gonna bring her back,
I promise you.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.691
Okay, thanks.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.027
Hey, got something.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.863
Give me one minute, okay?
Okay.

03:15.863 --> 03:19.199
State just called.
Buck was spotted north of here.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.535
He killed someone
and stole their truck.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.704
My daughter?
The surveillance footage

03:23.704 --> 03:25.506
suggests that he's still got
Emily and Denise.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.675
Beau, I think
they're still alive.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.042
Okay.
I'm gonna call Cass.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.412
I want her on this with us.
Let's move.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.619
Did the cops
see you come in?

04:11.619 --> 04:13.821
Come on, now,
you didn't raise a fool.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.226
Thought you didn't want
to see me anymore.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.629
That was before I knew
Buck was alive.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.898
Where is he?

04:24.898 --> 04:27.067
Why do you want to know?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.836
'Cause he hurt Paige.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.106
And he likes to cut out
women's hearts.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.645
I'm sick over
what he's done.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.415
There is one way
to fix that.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.651
I got a plan.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.255
I'm gonna
set everything right.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.264
Hey. I got here
as quickly as I could. Hey.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.766
Are you sure
it's Buck?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.568
Take a look.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.972
Buck was casing the lot
for a car to steal.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.640
We're guessing
this unlucky guy

05:06.640 --> 05:08.809
must have heard
Denise and Emily.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.880
And they're still alive.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.848
Hang on.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.385
Hey.
Take a look.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.821
Look at this.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.189
What is that?

05:22.189 --> 05:23.524
There--
he dropped something.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.192
Keys it looks like.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.394
Must be important.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.463
Let's get the lab
to enhance this.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.031
Maybe Cormac knows
what it is.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.300
That's a good idea, Cass.
Let's hit this from every angle.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.902
Meanwhile, we need
to talk to Sunny again.

05:38.506 --> 05:41.341
Hey.
We're gonna get them back.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.883
You cops keep hanging out,

05:49.883 --> 05:52.152
I'm gonna have to start
chargin' you rent.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.888
I have instructions to hold you
here until Sheriff Beau arrives.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.024
So that's why I can't
leave my house?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.492
Just following orders,
ma'am.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.160
Sheriff's on his way.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.868
It's just-- It's the--
It's the one--

06:07.868 --> 06:09.269
It's the one thing
that we're supposed to do

06:09.269 --> 06:10.538
is protect our kids.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.039
The one thing.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.875
Hey, you couldn't have done
anything differently.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.814
She's gotta be so scared, Jenny.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.385
She's gotta be terrified.

06:27.655 --> 06:30.458
And every minute we waste
chasing our tails

06:30.458 --> 06:32.092
gives that twisted
son of a bitch

06:32.092 --> 06:33.894
a chance to
do something to her.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.030
Look, I still believe he's
keeping her alive for leverage.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.432
Well, I hope you're right 'cause
there's nothing stopping him

06:38.432 --> 06:40.233
from making an example
out of one of them.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.876
Alright, we need
to talk to Sunny.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.544
She knows him better
than anyone.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.613
Okay. Okay.
Let's go get her.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.914
Let's go talk to Sunny.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.915
Okay.

06:54.915 --> 06:55.916
Come on.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.718
Yeah.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.095
Ohh.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.330
What the hell?

07:10.330 --> 07:12.800
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.505
Ms. Barnes?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.346
Oh, boy.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.625
All units,
this is Deputy Poppernak.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.693
Sunny Barnes is on the move.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.933
He dropped this.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.535
You ever seen it before?

07:50.170 --> 07:53.106
Yeah.
Yeah, not in a long time.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.342
Can you tell me about it?

07:55.342 --> 07:56.844
It's just an old keychain

07:56.844 --> 07:59.479
made out of some type of bone,
if I remember.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.214
What'd he use
the keys for?

08:01.214 --> 08:03.350
Uh, the gate to the easement
land that we hunted on.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.652
If we drove up there,
do you think you'd be able

08:04.652 --> 08:05.853
to find the gate again?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.521
I'd recognize the gate
if I saw it,

08:07.521 --> 08:10.190
and the cabin we slept in,
if it's still standing.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.693
Something tells me
it is.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.546
Get out of the car!

08:32.546 --> 08:35.415
Right now!

08:35.415 --> 08:37.751
Uh-huh, yeah.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.753
Where you headed?
You helping Buck?

08:39.753 --> 08:42.189
I was runnin' some errands.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.991
Where is Buck?!
Arlen...

08:43.991 --> 08:46.326
Where did he take
my daughter?

08:46.326 --> 08:48.061
Buck has Emily?

08:48.061 --> 08:50.197
You better tell me right now,
Sunny, or I swear to you...

08:50.197 --> 08:53.033
Arlen--
I don't have a clue
what you're talkin' about.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.034
You don't have a clue?
Beau.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.535
No.
Of course you don't.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.871
Stand down.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.239
You need to keep it together.
You know we need her.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.008
Emily is out there, okay?

09:01.008 --> 09:02.676
I know.
And I need to find her.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.944
We will.
I promise you we will.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.445
We just gotta do it
the right way.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.623
Turn it off, please.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.892
That's who
your husband is.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.194
Sunny,
we found Buck's bunker.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.196
He is
the Bleeding Heart Killer.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.698
I know.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.799
You know.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.467
Okay.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.269
Alright, well, either you
tell us what he told you,

09:29.269 --> 09:31.038
or we arrest you
for helping a killer.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.806
He told me he loved me,

09:32.806 --> 09:35.743
and no matter what happens,
he always will.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.278
Then he asked me
for help.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.713
Help with what?

09:39.713 --> 09:41.381
Escaping.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.884
So you were gonna
help him escape?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.653
I didn't say that.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.288
What about
Denise and Emily?

09:48.288 --> 09:49.890
He didn't say anything
about them?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.424
He did not.
And if he had,

09:51.424 --> 09:53.226
that woulda been
another conversation.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.562
You were on your way
to help him.
Not exactly.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.398
I was gonna talk him
into turning himself in.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.933
So what was the gun for?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.969
In case
he didn't wanna listen.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.807
Well, you listen to me--

10:06.807 --> 10:09.209
you're gonna help me
get my daughter back.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.481
Of course.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.033
You girls behavin' yourselves
back here?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.043
Ah!

11:26.486 --> 11:28.488
My father's gonna
find you.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.760
You want water or not?

11:32.760 --> 11:36.196
And when he does,

11:36.196 --> 11:38.265
he's gonna kill you.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.372
Buck...

11:45.372 --> 11:47.775
Buck,
she's just a child.

11:47.775 --> 11:48.876
You need to let her go.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.245
Open your mouth.

11:52.913 --> 11:53.881
Come on.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.616
No, no!

11:56.616 --> 11:57.918
Ohh!

11:59.419 --> 12:02.555
Aah!
I should've
checked his pockets.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.260
I'm gettin'
a little rusty.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.929
Ohh. Aah.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.203
Now...

12:16.203 --> 12:19.172
...next time, it's gonna be
gasoline and a lighter.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.575
Now, both of you shut up.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.686
Shh, shh, shh.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.595
Do you trust her?
'Cause I don't.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.232
We have no choice.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.733
It's the risk
we have to take.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.502
Sunny's our best shot
at finding your daughter.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.941
We got an incoming call.
No caller ID.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.442
Could be our guy.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.576
Okay, everybody,
here we go.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.947
Okay, Sunny,
stick to the plan.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.714
Got it.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.087
Buck...

13:07.087 --> 13:08.621
<i>You didn't call.</i>

13:08.621 --> 13:10.824
I needed
a little more time.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.492
<i>Well, you're either
in or you're out, Sunny.</i>

13:12.492 --> 13:15.362
<i>This is ride or die time,
alright?</i>

13:15.362 --> 13:17.197
<i>Ride or die.</i>

13:17.197 --> 13:19.399
So this is what
it's come to?

13:21.568 --> 13:22.702
Hm?

13:25.939 --> 13:28.008
Buck-- Buck,
I think, um,

13:28.008 --> 13:31.378
this is the end
of the road for us.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.847
End of the road?
What the hell does that mean?

13:33.847 --> 13:37.484
Well, you hadn't been honest
with me in a long time.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.652
Heck, probably never.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.688
I told you
we could work this out,

13:41.688 --> 13:44.224
but not over the phone.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.059
Yeah, well, why don't
we start with

13:46.059 --> 13:48.661
those women you grabbed?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.030
<i>Women?</i>

13:50.030 --> 13:53.500
I see the cops got to you,
didn't they?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.236
Alright,
that's enough.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.573
Where are they, Buck?

14:00.573 --> 14:02.175
Hello, Sheriff.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.676
<i>You listen to me,
you son of a bitch,</i>

14:03.676 --> 14:06.914
if you have any love left
for your wife whatsoever,

14:06.914 --> 14:09.416
you're gonna tell me
where my daughter is,

14:09.416 --> 14:11.551
or I will personally bring
the full weight of the law

14:11.551 --> 14:12.852
down on her head.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.521
She has nothin' to
do with this,

14:14.521 --> 14:15.555
and you know that.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.324
That doesn't matter!

14:17.324 --> 14:19.392
'Cause I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to get her back.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.694
<i>Well, I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.</i>

14:21.694 --> 14:24.231
You're gonna let Sunny go,
for starters.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.733
And if you don't,
I'm gonna start hurtin'.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.569
You hear that?
I'm gonna start hurtin'.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.738
Emily, Denise-- doesn't make
any difference to me.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.907
<i>Hell, I'm a sport.
I'll flip a damn coin.</i>

14:33.907 --> 14:35.242
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.544
That's-- That doesn't
work that way.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.713
You're not the one calling
the shots here, partner.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.549
<i>Now, I'll tell you how
it's gonna go down,</i>

14:42.549 --> 14:43.616
and listen up carefully.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.030
Any of this
look familiar?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.532
No, nothing.

14:59.532 --> 15:03.536
I wasn't paying attention,
and I missed everything.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.472
All the signs.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.041
There's nothing you could
have done about it back then.

15:08.041 --> 15:12.112
You're here now, and you're
helping me find this place.

15:12.112 --> 15:16.049
Yeah. It'd be a good place
to hide Denise and Emily.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.818
How far until the next gate?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.590
Two miles,
straight ahead.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.593
Hopefully, Jenny and Beau have
made progress with your mom.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.462
Yeah, I wouldn't pin
too many hopes on that.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.831
You think she knew?

15:31.831 --> 15:34.067
I don't know.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.969
But they shouldn't
trust her.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.686
Well, I don't like this.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.456
He's got us in here,
big open space.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.158
Can't get backup
or snipers

15:58.158 --> 16:01.028
in without
him seeing it.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.862
What's his play?

16:02.862 --> 16:05.698
I'm bettin' he thinks
he's got all the cards.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.701
Maybe, but we got
one thing he wants.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.870
Yeah, well,
she's a wild card at best.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.473
There's no way helping us
is all she wants out of this.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.642
Yeah, I'm not
buying it either.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.844
Okay. Alright,
well, eyes open.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.512
Stay alert.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.385
Oh. Here we go.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.292
Wait, where's
the trailer?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.863
They're not even here.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.000
Where are they, Buck?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.169
Oh, they're safe...

16:42.169 --> 16:44.537
for now.

16:45.872 --> 16:46.873
Buck.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.008
I thought we had a deal.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.544
Well, we'll get to that
as soon as you let Sunny go.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.047
First, tell us where
Emily and Denise are.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.316
After I talk to my wife.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.518
And why would
I let you do that?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.087
Why?

17:00.087 --> 17:02.689
'Cause I've got nothin'
to lose, Sheriff.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.358
I shoot myself,
you'll never find 'em.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.526
No.

17:06.526 --> 17:11.098
Now...
I want to see my wife.

17:13.766 --> 17:17.204
Alright. I'll let you
see your wife.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.739
But you need to tell me
where you put my daughter.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.376
Well, I guess
we got a little

17:23.376 --> 17:25.278
chicken and egg problem
here, Sheriff.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.750
Hell, why don't you just
take me out,

17:30.750 --> 17:32.051
if that's what
you want to do?!

17:32.051 --> 17:33.253
He's not gonna budge.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.755
Go on.
Just give him Sunny.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.390
Give it your best shot!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.394
But you'll
never find them.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.699
Alright.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.046
Don't try anything
funny, okay?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.614
Just stick to the plan.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.123
We need the location
of the girls.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.392
That's our number one priority.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.161
I'll bring them back
safe and sound.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.429
Okay, Buck, we're gonna
let you talk to your wife

18:16.429 --> 18:19.466
as a sign of good faith,
but don't do anything stupid.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.100
Nobody needs to
get hurt.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.439
Okay.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.216
You okay, Sunny?

18:37.284 --> 18:38.785
Okay?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.887
I'm a long way from okay.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.826
You need to end this right now.
Do the right thing.

18:46.826 --> 18:50.363
I've been trying to do
that all my life.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.165
Alright, time's up, Buck.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.501
Where are they?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.537
Come here.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.876
This is how
this is gonna go.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.213
I'm gonna leave here
with Sunny.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.348
When we get far enough out,

19:08.348 --> 19:10.149
I'm gonna give you a call
and tell you where they are.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.385
No!

19:12.385 --> 19:14.687
No. No.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.155
Now, be smart
about this, son.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.825
No!
What other choice do you have?

19:24.531 --> 19:27.033
That's what I thought.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.201
Come on.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.544
I'll be in touch, Sheriff.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.055
Let's go.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.207
This is the gate.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.842
Okay.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.350
"BB."

20:17.350 --> 20:19.519
Buck Barnes.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.388
His lock's in the front.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.556
Means he was the last
to go through. What now?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.892
We hike in.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.237
Don't need
them trackin' us.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.306
What else they
put on you?

20:40.740 --> 20:41.974
Come on, Sunny.

20:44.176 --> 20:47.213
Okay. Well, you won't mind
if I search you then.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.381
Find out.
Stop it!

20:48.381 --> 20:49.649
Come here.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.551
Stop it before you
kill both of us.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.257
It's in my jacket.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.826
That's what I thought.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.829
Here.

21:04.196 --> 21:07.567
I was scared, Buck.
I'm scared of you.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.768
There's no need
to be scared.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.136
I did everything
you asked.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.805
I'd never hurt you.
I love you, Sunny.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.014
So where are we going?

21:25.284 --> 21:29.121
Talk to me, Buck.
What's this all about?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.990
And I want the truth.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.660
You're my world, Sunny.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.363
You saved me once before,
and I thought if I could see you

21:36.363 --> 21:40.299
one more time, just once,
we could--

21:40.299 --> 21:41.834
We could what?

21:41.834 --> 21:44.671
We could, you know,
be us again.

21:44.671 --> 21:48.875
There's not gonna be
any you or me or us

21:48.875 --> 21:51.277
or the life we had.

21:51.277 --> 21:54.146
You brought all this mess
down on the both of us.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.815
We start over, okay?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.351
We leave town,
we find a new spot.

21:58.351 --> 22:01.788
We can't run from this.
And they told me what you did.

22:01.788 --> 22:05.024
Well [sighs] I got a little
crossed up is all.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.199
Listen to me.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.868
Do you think you could
ever forgive me?

22:21.708 --> 22:26.379
If you do the right thing
and give those women back,

22:26.379 --> 22:28.180
I'll consider it.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.850
You gotta let those
girls go.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.920
Well, I'm afraid
it's not that simple, Sunny.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.423
Okay, I'm done.
Pull over.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.524
Pull over right here.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.025
I want out.
What?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.660
I want out, now!
Alright, hold on a second.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.994
Out of this truck.
Hold on a second.
Listen to me.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.663
Pull it over now!
Alright. Hold on.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.997
I'm serious!
Alright, you win.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.600
Call them. Call 'em.

22:49.335 --> 22:50.336
<i>Talk to me.</i>

22:50.336 --> 22:51.938
Buck's ready to talk.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.674
Go on.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.743
You ready
for the coordinates?

23:01.548 --> 23:04.551
I want
response teams ready.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.953
I want SWAT, K-9,
search and rescue.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.088
Already on it.
What about Buck?

23:09.088 --> 23:10.457
As long as Sunny sticks
to the plan,

23:10.457 --> 23:11.924
we can deal
with Buck later.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.192
This is about getting
the girls back alive.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.294
Getting close.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.433
Alright,
I made the call.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.034
Throw your phone
out the window.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.711
I need you, Sunny.

23:31.711 --> 23:34.914
This world doesn't mean
anything without you in it.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.449
Doesn't make any sense.

23:36.449 --> 23:40.086
You remember our spot
where you asked me to marry you?

23:40.086 --> 23:43.122
Of course. Why?

23:43.122 --> 23:45.224
I want to go there.

23:45.224 --> 23:48.260
We don't have time to stop.
They're gonna be after us.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.897
How do you know
I don't have a plan?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.800
You mind tellin' me
what it is?

23:54.967 --> 23:56.503
One thing at a time.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.908
Okay, Sunny Barnes.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.876
Okay.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.116
<i>Arriving at
the coordinates now.</i>

24:10.116 --> 24:12.485
<i>We're approaching
the southeast side.</i>

24:12.485 --> 24:14.787
We need an ETA
on the rest of the units.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.190
<i>Got the southwest
corner covered.</i>

24:20.092 --> 24:21.761
I've got a visual
on the trailer.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.666
Can't wait.
Let's go.

24:26.666 --> 24:27.767
Watch my left.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.508
Emily!

24:36.843 --> 24:38.511
Hey, what's that?

24:38.511 --> 24:40.279
Do you hear that?

24:45.184 --> 24:46.686
Beau, wait!

25:19.018 --> 25:20.653
Emily?

25:20.653 --> 25:22.488
Denise?

25:35.668 --> 25:37.570
Denise?

25:41.173 --> 25:43.209
They're not here.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.211
Damn it.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.046
But my dad was.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.649
And not that long ago.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.457
Okay.

25:58.457 --> 26:01.060
One of the deputies hit a trip
beam that blew the trailer.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.795
It was just one body.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.530
Techs think it was the guy that
Buck killed outside the bar.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.865
Well, that means
that Buck still

26:05.865 --> 26:07.199
has the girls stashed somewhere.

26:07.199 --> 26:08.434
I bet you they're
still alive.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.136
He's about
wasting time.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.539
Yeah, Pop, go.

26:13.539 --> 26:15.708
Hey, boss, we found Buck's rig
two clicks north

26:15.708 --> 26:17.276
from where they ditched
the tracker.

26:17.276 --> 26:18.577
Did they switch cars?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.212
I don't think so.

26:20.212 --> 26:23.616
Looks like they're on foot,
headed up a remote trail.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.051
Okay, nice work, Pop.
Stay put.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.252
We're headed to you.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.386
Where the hell
are they going?

26:27.386 --> 26:29.155
One way to find out.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.638
Well,
we're here.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.740
Now what?

26:47.740 --> 26:50.009
You remember that
promise you made me?

26:50.009 --> 26:52.344
I do.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.716
Well, you broke it.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.554
Everything we had
is broken.

27:03.522 --> 27:06.492
I gave you everything,
and I thought I knew

27:06.492 --> 27:10.797
what kind of a man you were,
but I was wrong.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.132
You're no man at all.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.667
Now, come on, Sunny.

27:14.667 --> 27:18.137
And I think deep down
inside, I knew that.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.539
So we were both lyin'.

27:21.373 --> 27:25.111
But that's gonna stop
right here where it started.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.346
Come on, Sunny.
Listen to me.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.514
I can change.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.953
I'm sorry about all--
Sorry ain't gonna cut it, Buck!

27:33.953 --> 27:35.822
You turned me
against Walter.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.489
You deceived me.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.026
And all those bad things
you did?

27:40.026 --> 27:41.660
I can't abide that.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.196
I'm not asking you to.
