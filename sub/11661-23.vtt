(serene music playing)

01:04.500 --> 01:05.333
Morning, Dorothy.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.567
I don't want to hear it
from Bryant Gumbel or you.

01:10.834 --> 01:11.667
Problem?

01:11.734 --> 01:14.667
I still don't have
a date for Jenny's wedding.

01:14.734 --> 01:17.734
My own Goddaughter,
and I'll show up alone.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.800
How humiliating.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.533
Don't rub it in.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.734
I meant for me.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.667
I called every guy I know,

01:26.734 --> 01:29.500
and they all had
the same lame excuse,

01:29.567 --> 01:31.166
"I don't want to go."

01:32.500 --> 01:35.133
Morning. Dorothy,
do you have a date yet?

01:35.200 --> 01:37.166
I don't want to go.

01:37.233 --> 01:40.033
Dorothy, I'll get you a date.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.200
You can borrow one of my extras.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.100
What kind of guy would you like?

01:45.166 --> 01:46.166
She's not picky.

01:46.233 --> 01:47.767
Yes, I am.

01:47.834 --> 01:51.900
You could circle the globe
without finding another Stan.

01:51.967 --> 01:54.033
Why do you care about it?

01:54.100 --> 01:56.233
Family honor,
especially at this wedding.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.100
What's so special about it?

01:58.166 --> 02:01.133
Dorothy's Goddaughter
is marrying the grandson

02:01.200 --> 02:03.066
of Giuseppe Mangiacavallo.

02:06.967 --> 02:08.000
So?

02:08.066 --> 02:09.734
Let her tell the story.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.800
In Sicily, my father arranged
my marriage with a neighbor's son.

02:13.867 --> 02:19.133
My dowry was two chickens, a ladle,
and a goat to be named later.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.000
We came from a wealthy family.

02:22.066 --> 02:24.300
As I stood at the altar,

02:24.367 --> 02:28.100
my fiancé was on a cattle boat
headed for America.

02:28.166 --> 02:31.100
That night,
on a tear-stained pillow,

02:31.166 --> 02:32.600
I put a curse on him.

02:32.667 --> 02:33.934
A curse?

02:33.967 --> 02:38.266
Nothing fancy. I said,
"Giuseppe Mangiacavallo,

02:38.333 --> 02:39.266
from this day forward,

02:39.333 --> 02:41.633
may you and all
your future generations

02:41.700 --> 02:43.300
never know true love.

02:43.367 --> 02:46.033
May you and all
your offspring be sterile.

02:48.433 --> 02:50.467
May your hair never lie flat,

02:50.533 --> 02:54.700
and may your socks always slip down
inside your shoes."

02:56.066 --> 02:58.567
And this is the same
Giuseppe Mangiacavallo

02:58.633 --> 03:00.467
who is the grandfather of the groom?

03:00.533 --> 03:02.834
See why I want us to look good?

03:02.900 --> 03:05.767
How should I break this to you?

03:05.834 --> 03:07.333
Gently. I'm old.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.967
Giuseppe Mangiacavallo
has had a fabulous life.

03:12.033 --> 03:14.700
He's in his 80s,
he's a multimillionaire

03:14.767 --> 03:16.800
and enjoys perfect health.

03:16.867 --> 03:20.333
Well, it's a very
slow-acting curse.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.767
So it would appear.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.233
That's the beauty of it.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.834
He's been lulled into
a false sense of security,

03:26.900 --> 03:30.433
so I don't want you
blowing my big moment.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.934
Sophia's right.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.934
Dorothy, come on.
Borrow one of my men.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.133
One of my many, many, many,
many, many, many men.

03:40.433 --> 03:43.233
All right, for ma's sake.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.400
Now, let's see,
you're going with Howard.

03:45.467 --> 03:47.633
Dr. Howard.

03:47.700 --> 03:48.834
How about Doug?

03:48.900 --> 03:51.033
Not Doug.
I couldn't possibly.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.900
He's on my "A" list.

03:54.533 --> 03:56.700
Dorothy, he's a judge.

03:56.767 --> 03:57.767
He's fun to be with,

03:57.834 --> 04:01.367
and I haven't paid a speeding ticket
in six months.

04:01.433 --> 04:03.200
This is why I hate doing this.

04:03.266 --> 04:05.233
You always do this.

04:05.300 --> 04:09.200
You keep the good guys
and give us the leftovers.

04:09.266 --> 04:10.567
Know what your trouble is?

04:10.633 --> 04:11.900
Of course, not.

04:13.567 --> 04:16.066
You're only generous
when it doesn't mean anything.

04:16.133 --> 04:18.266
You won't give if it hurts.

04:18.767 --> 04:21.667
Hey, Dorothy, you could
always call Claude Hughes.

04:21.734 --> 04:22.667
Oh, come on, Ma.

04:22.734 --> 04:26.467
Claude Hughes is the dullest,
ugliest man I know.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.767
So, what's the problem?

04:29.266 --> 04:30.834
He didn't want to go.

04:33.266 --> 04:37.200
(mellow music playing)

04:40.600 --> 04:42.533
Ma, now that you've finished,
could I see that?

04:48.400 --> 04:51.100
Next time I'll ask you
to hand me the candlestick.

04:54.734 --> 04:59.300
Look, Ma, it's not so terrible
if I go to the wedding alone.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.433
Hi, Rose.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.800
It's not fair.
I don't deserve these problems.

05:03.867 --> 05:06.934
Maybe I can help. I live to help.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.100
I'm a great friend,
contrary to popular belief.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.533
Miles can't take me
to the wedding.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.300
He's leaving
for a teaching seminar.

05:16.367 --> 05:17.367
Now I can't go.

05:17.433 --> 05:19.166
That shouldn't stop you.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.734
I have my reasons.
It's a long story.

05:21.800 --> 05:22.934
Got to run.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.667
Now, what's this
all about?

05:29.734 --> 05:32.934
-It started 40 years ago--
-Oh, my God.

05:35.467 --> 05:39.200
At my wedding in St. Olaf's
great Shepherd church.

05:39.266 --> 05:40.934
Oh, it was beautiful,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.200
especially when all those
balloons dropped from the ceiling.

05:44.266 --> 05:46.400
You had balloons
in the church?

05:46.467 --> 05:50.600
It's not as if we filled them
with air. We learned our lesson.

05:50.667 --> 05:51.967
You put air in them,

05:52.033 --> 05:57.433
and the boys' choir used them
to make disgusting noises.

05:57.500 --> 06:01.100
Go on with your story, darling.
I care deeply.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.734
Well, after the wedding,

06:02.800 --> 06:07.433
Charlie and I had the most exciting,
passionate night of our lives.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.033
After that, whenever
we'd go to a wedding,

06:10.100 --> 06:12.533
we'd end up going home,

06:12.600 --> 06:16.166
putting on the cast album
of "Song of Norway,"

06:16.233 --> 06:19.166
and going crazy on each other.

06:19.233 --> 06:21.700
You're saying weddings get you hot?

06:21.767 --> 06:23.633
Yes.

06:26.133 --> 06:28.133
It was fine while Charlie was alive,

06:28.200 --> 06:31.767
but I'll never forget that
first wedding after he died.

06:31.834 --> 06:36.233
You see why I can't go
if Miles is out of town.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.400
I might end up almost going to bed
with the caterer again.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.300
Rose, I want to help,

06:43.367 --> 06:46.800
but first you have to tell me
what the problem is.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.166
You have nothing
to worry about.

06:51.233 --> 06:53.600
We wouldn't let you
do something you'd regret.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.400
That's what I was
going to say, I swear.

06:55.467 --> 06:59.200
Oh, you're such good friends.

06:59.266 --> 07:02.033
-You hear that, Dorothy?
-You're trying too hard.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.467
You hurt me with what you said.

07:04.533 --> 07:07.834
Let me get you somebody
hot off my "A" list.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.767
Somebody tall, good-looking,
goes with everything.

07:12.100 --> 07:12.900
Doug?

07:12.967 --> 07:16.734
How about an ex-racecar driver,
speaks five languages,

07:16.800 --> 07:18.867
has three car dealerships.

07:18.934 --> 07:21.033
He limps slightly
and only dances in a circle,

07:21.100 --> 07:22.967
but that works at a wedding.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.166
Doug.

07:26.233 --> 07:30.700
I've got an anesthesiologist,
but you won't feel anything.

07:30.767 --> 07:32.033
Doug.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.967
All right, Doug.

07:34.033 --> 07:36.367
But listen, you be careful.

07:36.433 --> 07:39.367
This man's on loan from
the Blanche Devereaux collection.

07:42.100 --> 07:46.533
(calm music playing)

07:54.033 --> 07:56.100
Oh, what a beautiful wedding.

07:56.166 --> 07:59.000
And, Ma, nothing went wrong.

07:59.066 --> 08:01.367
Curses don't work in church.
Too many statues.

08:01.433 --> 08:03.333
Give it time.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.800
Is it just me, or did you notice
the buns on that priest?

08:15.133 --> 08:17.300
Take it easy. Breathe deeply.

08:17.367 --> 08:18.400
It'll be all right.

08:18.467 --> 08:21.066
Nothing to worry about.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.600
We're here to look out for you.

08:22.667 --> 08:26.967
I hope the band doesn't play
the "St. Olaf wedding march."

08:27.033 --> 08:30.900
I think the chances of them playing
that are pretty slim.

08:30.967 --> 08:33.834
It got awfully popular
after Laurel and Hardy

08:33.900 --> 08:36.567
started using it
as their theme song.

08:39.233 --> 08:41.333
Let's keep an eye on her.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.400
I'm going to find Mangiacavallo.

08:43.467 --> 08:47.934
I want him to see the tasty morsel
he let slip away.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.100
-Where's Doug?
-He's checking our coats.

08:52.166 --> 08:56.066
I want to thank you.
He's really a very nice guy.

08:56.133 --> 08:59.033
I don't know why I even came.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.133
This is the last doctor I'll date.

09:01.200 --> 09:06.033
Imagine, dumping me for
an emergency appendectomy.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.533
I hate it when these doctors
use the Hippocratic oath

09:08.600 --> 09:11.200
as an excuse for everything.

09:11.266 --> 09:13.533
Blanche, it was his appendix.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.867
-Sorry that took so long.
-Shall we sit down?

09:17.934 --> 09:19.400
Yes, let's.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.300
Sophia!

09:27.367 --> 09:30.767
After all this time,
I was hoping you'd come.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.400
I wouldn't have missed it.

09:32.467 --> 09:36.100
You've still got those beautiful
eyes that light up a room.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.600
I had cataracts.

09:39.533 --> 09:40.900
Very becoming.

09:40.967 --> 09:42.834
Ok, enough chitchat.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.300
All this will crash
down on your head.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.367
What are you saying?

09:46.433 --> 09:49.667
It's my revenge.
I put a curse on you.

09:49.734 --> 09:52.367
There are no curses, Sophia.

09:52.433 --> 09:55.066
That's 1,000 miles
and 100 years ago.

09:55.133 --> 09:57.767
Sophia put a curse on me.

09:57.834 --> 09:59.633
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

10:07.100 --> 10:11.233
(soft music playing)

10:19.100 --> 10:21.433
Dorothy looks very happy,
doesn't she?

10:21.500 --> 10:23.367
You really came through, Blanche.

10:23.433 --> 10:25.467
I feel all warm inside.

10:26.934 --> 10:29.767
This must be what they call
the joy of giving.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.834
Feels a lot like cramps.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.333
Cocktail wiener?

10:49.700 --> 10:51.000
Aren't you nice.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.367
Do you like jazz?

10:53.433 --> 10:54.433
No, ma'am.

10:54.934 --> 10:58.066
There's something
about a man with a tray.

10:58.133 --> 11:00.734
Is it warm in here?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.667
Would you just
look at them?

11:04.734 --> 11:07.133
-They look good together.
-I don't think so.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.367
I think Dorothy's falling for him.

11:09.433 --> 11:12.400
Little miss hard-to-get
is letting him lead.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.533
I'm going to find the men's room.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.467
It's right down the hall
on your right.

11:22.233 --> 11:25.867
Blanche, I want to thank you.
I'm really having a good time.

11:25.934 --> 11:29.000
There's a thin line
between having a good time

11:29.066 --> 11:32.033
and becoming an obvious wanton slut.

11:35.033 --> 11:38.233
I know. My toe's been on that line.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.667
Sophia,
I was hoping we could dance.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.867
It's too late to kissy up.

11:45.934 --> 11:48.300
A plague on both your houses.

11:48.367 --> 11:51.567
Actually, I have four houses
and a summer home.

11:51.633 --> 11:54.300
Ma, calm down.
There's no curse.

11:54.367 --> 11:55.633
Nothing's going to happen.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.533
How could you do that?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.266
You're making such a thing.

11:59.333 --> 12:02.066
Leave me alone.
I hate you!

12:02.133 --> 12:04.533
Just a little lovers' quarrel.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.700
Go on with the party.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.166
I better see what's wrong.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.100
-Care to dance?
-Love to.

12:22.233 --> 12:23.400
Can you believe that?

12:23.467 --> 12:26.667
Was that worth waiting
70 years for or what?

12:26.734 --> 12:27.767
I love it.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.266
The Mangiacavallo curse
is finally kicking in.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.834
Vengeance is mine.

12:32.900 --> 12:35.700
Think they'll let us
take home the centerpieces?

12:40.667 --> 12:45.567
(serene music playing)

12:52.033 --> 12:52.967
Can you believe it?

12:53.033 --> 12:56.100
She's been dancing with him
for half an hour.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.967
Don't let it get to you, pussycat.

12:59.033 --> 13:02.233
You're lousing up
the happiest day of my life.

13:03.967 --> 13:06.033
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

13:06.100 --> 13:07.600
I couldn't help noticing.

13:07.667 --> 13:11.133
How do you make your eyes
twirl around like that?

13:12.133 --> 13:15.266
It's not hard. I just try
to think of two things at once.

13:16.834 --> 13:19.066
Well, it's very attractive.

13:19.133 --> 13:21.066
Have you always
been able to do it?

13:21.133 --> 13:24.033
No, only at weddings.

13:24.533 --> 13:26.000
Excuse me.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.800
Look at Blanche
nuzzling up to him.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.734
I won't take this lying down.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.400
I don't think you'll be invited.

13:37.367 --> 13:39.633
Excuse me.
I want to fix my face.

13:39.700 --> 13:44.600
I don't know whether you've noticed,
but women usually do this in pairs.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.867
Sophia?

13:49.934 --> 13:52.200
Am I the only one who feels like
ripping her clothes off

13:52.266 --> 13:53.767
and doing the hokey-pokey?

13:55.867 --> 13:58.767
No, they're waiting for someone
to get them started.

14:04.467 --> 14:07.133
All right, Blanche,
what are you doing?

14:07.200 --> 14:09.967
Just trying to make
myself even more attractive.

14:10.033 --> 14:11.266
Pointless, isn't it?

14:11.333 --> 14:14.233
I'm talking about Doug.
He's here with me.

14:14.300 --> 14:18.400
I know.
I set it up in the first place.

14:18.467 --> 14:20.734
He spoke very highly of you.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.867
I knew you'd do this,
and now you've done it.

14:24.934 --> 14:26.900
Dorothy,
you're starting to upset me.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.567
Don't ruin my evening.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.100
After all, it's your fault.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.500
How is it my fault?

14:31.567 --> 14:34.300
If you'd let me choose
from my "B" list,

14:34.367 --> 14:36.266
I wouldn't be so attracted.

14:37.433 --> 14:39.900
-No tissues.
-Listen, Blanche, we have to talk.

14:39.967 --> 14:41.600
Not now, Dorothy.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.467
Suit yourself.

14:43.533 --> 14:46.333
Dorothy,
will you let me out of here?

14:46.400 --> 14:47.967
No way, Blanche.

14:48.033 --> 14:51.100
You can't do this.
It violates my civil rights.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.200
You have the time,
you have the paper.

14:53.266 --> 14:56.233
Write a letter to your senator.

14:57.700 --> 14:58.567
Oh!

14:58.633 --> 15:01.500
My steady boyfriend
is out of town,

15:01.567 --> 15:04.934
so unfortunately,
I'm not available.

15:05.033 --> 15:07.300
Unless, of course, you like jazz.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.633
I've got Dizzy Gillespie
back at my place.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.200
Does he like jazz?

15:17.100 --> 15:19.600
Why don't we find out?

15:19.667 --> 15:21.767
Okey-dokey, daddy-o.

15:24.233 --> 15:28.233
-Sophia.
-You still alive?

15:28.300 --> 15:29.333
Sophia, please.

15:29.400 --> 15:33.767
Joey's alone in the bridal suite,
the bride is who knows where,

15:33.834 --> 15:35.900
and the band doesn't know
<i>Volare.</i>

15:35.967 --> 15:38.667
You've got to do something
about the curse.

15:38.734 --> 15:40.533
Oh, so now you believe?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.734
You can't escape your roots.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.533
Why should I do this?

15:44.600 --> 15:48.300
You left me at the altar,
shaming me and my father.

15:48.367 --> 15:50.266
You sullied my reputation.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.734
We didn't do anything.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.233
Well, how do you think
that made me look?

15:55.300 --> 15:58.533
I was a kid. I was scared
that if I got married,

15:58.600 --> 16:02.667
I'd never get out
of that village.

16:02.734 --> 16:05.567
Leaving you was
the toughest thing I ever did.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.367
Yeah.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.467
I was quite a dish back then.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.967
The longest legs of any girl
in the village.

16:18.633 --> 16:21.166
Dorothy,
let me out of here right now.

16:21.233 --> 16:22.834
There's only one way out,

16:22.900 --> 16:25.300
and you can't hold
your breath long enough.

16:28.033 --> 16:30.333
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.400
Five years of molehills.
They add up.

16:33.467 --> 16:35.333
Doug means this much to you?

16:35.400 --> 16:38.333
I'm not talking about Doug.
This is about you.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.734
She asked for another chance.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.967
I gave it to her.

16:42.033 --> 16:44.066
Biggest mistake I ever made.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.467
You're right, aunt Dorothy,
you can't trust people.

16:47.533 --> 16:51.233
Joey told me about some
of the things at his bachelor party.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.934
Bachelor parties can be fun.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.200
Aunt Blanche?

16:57.567 --> 16:59.300
Darling, you look lovely.

17:01.867 --> 17:03.633
What you said about
not trusting people

17:03.700 --> 17:05.567
made perfect sense.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.367
I should go tell Joey.

17:07.433 --> 17:10.066
It may not be the same thing.

17:10.133 --> 17:13.233
Joey didn't lie.
He told you the truth.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.500
I guess.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.266
It sounds like you two
had a little misunderstanding,

17:18.333 --> 17:21.800
not five years of deliberate
betrayal of trust.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.066
Do that once more,
I'll write on this wall

17:27.133 --> 17:30.300
"For a good time,
call Dorothy Zbornak."

17:30.367 --> 17:32.734
This is the ladies' room.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.867
Right.

17:39.066 --> 17:42.033
I think you should talk to Joey.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.934
The best thing to do
in any relationship is talk.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.867
-That's right.
-I have nothing to say to you.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.266
Sophia,
I can't believe that saying this

18:00.333 --> 18:03.266
will right 70 years
of being wronged.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.467
Just say it.
It'll make me feel better.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.700
-Sophia, I can't.
-Do it.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.967
Everyone, may I have
your attention, please?

18:19.033 --> 18:21.300
This is Sophia Petrillo,

18:21.367 --> 18:25.000
the girl who stood me up
at the altar 70 years ago.

18:28.767 --> 18:29.700
And?

18:30.500 --> 18:33.567
I just asked her
to be my wife again,

18:33.633 --> 18:35.767
and again she said no.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.266
Go on.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.300
And so from now on...

18:42.934 --> 18:44.200
I'm gay.

18:49.734 --> 18:52.133
Ok, we're even.
Let's take care of the kids.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.633
Ma, have you seen Rose?

18:55.700 --> 18:56.700
She left with Doug.

18:56.767 --> 18:59.266
Boy, were her eyes twirling.

19:00.433 --> 19:03.467
How could she do this to me...
or you.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.734
Who did she do this to?
Dorothy, what's happening?

19:05.800 --> 19:09.133
We were supposed
to look after her.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.200
We knew
she gets hot at weddings.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.600
She was counting on us.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.200
You don't look after me
when I'm hot.

19:14.266 --> 19:16.500
That's because
I also have a day job.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.000
Here's the bridal suite.

19:23.066 --> 19:25.967
I'll bless you for this.

19:26.033 --> 19:28.533
I'll give them
the chance we never got.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.000
This could take a while.

19:30.066 --> 19:31.900
It won't be pretty.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.900
-Ever see <i>The Exorcist?</i>
-No.

19:33.967 --> 19:35.100
Good movie.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.800
Well, here goes.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.033
Oh, sorry, kids.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.767
Don't stop on my account.

19:46.567 --> 19:47.767
Curse is over.

19:51.033 --> 19:56.000
(soft music playing)

19:56.500 --> 19:58.633
Dorothy, I wish you'd talk to me.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.233
What I need is
a good talking to.

20:06.734 --> 20:08.800
I don't care what you say,

20:08.867 --> 20:11.467
so long as you care
enough to say it.

20:11.533 --> 20:13.000
You stink.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.800
God bless you, Dorothy.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.867
Later, Blanche.
I'm too worried about Rose.

20:19.934 --> 20:22.500
-We weren't very good friends.
-We weren't.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.967
I hope she'll forgive us.

20:25.033 --> 20:27.900
That's what she does best.

20:27.967 --> 20:29.500
Blanche, I owe you an apology.

20:29.567 --> 20:33.166
How can I be high and mighty
about our friendship

20:33.233 --> 20:35.867
when I can't do Rose
the simple favor

20:35.934 --> 20:38.734
of keeping her out of trouble?

20:38.800 --> 20:42.000
I have to remember you
for the person you are

20:42.066 --> 20:44.367
and accept you for that.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.633
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

20:52.100 --> 20:54.333
I thought
I'd established eye contact

20:54.400 --> 20:56.734
with a guy in the rhythm section.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.800
Well, hello again.

21:00.867 --> 21:02.100
Where's Rose?

21:02.166 --> 21:03.967
I don't know what happened.

21:04.033 --> 21:06.200
We were going to my place.

21:06.266 --> 21:11.233
She wanted to go to my place,
then she didn't want to go,

21:11.300 --> 21:13.800
then we're headed for the airport.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.900
Oh, that is low.

21:15.967 --> 21:17.734
Not only do you
take advantage of her,

21:17.800 --> 21:21.700
you take her to the area in town
with the cheapest motel rates.

21:23.834 --> 21:28.734
She wanted to catch a plane
so she could be with this guy Miles.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.233
He must be something.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.400
So is Rose.

21:32.467 --> 21:35.033
So, either of you ladies
care to dance?

21:35.100 --> 21:37.767
You left with another woman.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.633
You were taking her to your place.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.967
Now you come back
and ask us to dance?

21:43.033 --> 21:44.333
How can you do that?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.367
It's still early.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.300
Remember that restaurant in Sicily
we went to on Sundays?

21:52.367 --> 21:56.867
I'd save up all week for one plate
of pasta that we'd share.

21:56.934 --> 22:00.400
With checkered tablecloths,
a candle in the Chianti bottle,

22:00.467 --> 22:02.467
the bad paintings
of the Colosseum?

22:02.533 --> 22:03.667
You remember.

22:03.734 --> 22:05.667
No, but the odds
were in my favor.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.200
(theme music playing)
