Be free!

11:37.497 --> 11:40.698
Uh-oh.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.934
- [screams]

11:42.936 --> 11:44.802
Spongebob!

11:44.804 --> 11:46.904
- [whistling]

12:01.086 --> 12:03.454
- Hi-yah!

12:03.456 --> 12:04.055
Squidward!

12:04.057 --> 12:05.423
Sorry, buddy.
Didn't see you.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.524
Are you okay?

12:06.526 --> 12:07.158
- [groans]

12:07.160 --> 12:09.994
What kind of unforeseen
yet completely predictable

12:09.996 --> 12:13.998
Stupidity have you
ruined my day with this time?

12:14.000 --> 12:14.565
- Oh.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.067
I'm just practicing
my karate chops.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.569
I'm going to have
an intense karate session

12:18.571 --> 12:19.303
With sandy later.

12:19.305 --> 12:22.840
Sandy says, "you never know
what kind of creepy creeper

12:22.842 --> 12:26.611
Could be creeping creepily
around any creepy corner."

12:26.613 --> 12:27.678
- Paranoid much?

12:27.680 --> 12:29.180
- [screams]

12:29.182 --> 12:29.847
Sorry, squidward.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.849
I thought you were
one of those creepy creepers.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.185
You know, squidward,
you really should learn

12:34.187 --> 12:35.186
How to protect yourself.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.154
Maybe you'd like to join us?

12:37.156 --> 12:39.890
- Well...

12:39.892 --> 12:40.324
Nope.

12:40.326 --> 12:43.127
I have more
important things to do.

12:43.129 --> 12:43.928
- Okey-dokey, squidward.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.298
Stop on by later if you change
your mind about the karate.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.067
- I won't.

12:56.608 --> 12:57.808
- [faint wheeze]

12:57.810 --> 12:59.043
- H-hello?

12:59.045 --> 13:02.246
Is somebody there?

13:02.248 --> 13:03.681
Um, hello?

13:03.683 --> 13:07.652
It's considered rude
not to answer.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.587
[nervous chuckle]
what do you got,

13:09.589 --> 13:11.589
Cotton in your earholes?

13:11.591 --> 13:13.924
[nervous laughter]

13:13.926 --> 13:15.826
[gulps]

13:15.828 --> 13:17.595
I've got to get out of here.

13:17.597 --> 13:21.866
[yelping]

13:28.607 --> 13:31.676
Spongebob!
[knocking furiously]

13:31.678 --> 13:37.214
[laughter]

13:37.216 --> 13:38.816
- Oh wait,
I-I don't get it.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.717
- Spongebob!

13:39.719 --> 13:43.454
Spongebob!
Open up!

13:43.456 --> 13:44.588
- Squidward?

13:44.590 --> 13:47.825
- Hurry, spongebob.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.026
- Squidward,
what's wrong?

13:49.028 --> 13:51.462
- You were...
Right.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.229
- I was?
About what?

13:52.231 --> 13:56.167
- About how danger
lurks around every corner.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.368
[screams]

13:57.370 --> 13:58.369
- Um, squidward?

13:58.371 --> 13:59.603
It's just gary.

13:59.605 --> 14:00.771
- [mewing]

14:00.773 --> 14:03.274
- Hey, I should have
named you "scary,"

14:03.276 --> 14:04.809
Eh, buddy?

14:04.811 --> 14:06.243
- [mewing]

14:06.245 --> 14:07.478
- Spongebob,
this is serious.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.214
I was just viciously attacked.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.649
- [gasps]
no.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.884
- You've got to teach me,
spongebob.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.953
Teach me the way.

14:15.955 --> 14:18.889
The way of "tara-ke".

14:18.891 --> 14:20.624
- Uh, don't you mean karate?

14:20.626 --> 14:23.494
- Um, sure.
Whatever.

14:24.162 --> 14:26.797
- Hmm.
Hmm.

14:26.799 --> 14:27.431
Hmm, yes.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.633
You show potential,
young student.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.369
But with the rubbery arms,

14:31.371 --> 14:33.070
And the doughiness
in this area,

14:33.072 --> 14:35.072
We obviously have
our work cut out for us.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.675
- Can't we just get on
with this, spongebob?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.377
- [shushing]
- [sighs]

14:39.379 --> 14:42.813
I mean, can't we just
get on with this,

14:42.815 --> 14:44.048
Oh, great sensei?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.016
- Pay close attention,
and you will receive

14:46.018 --> 14:48.986
The totality
of my karate mastery.

14:48.988 --> 14:52.456
Handed down from
sensei cheeks herself.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.591
Now watch,

14:53.593 --> 14:55.826
Watch and learn.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.328
Wi-yah!

14:58.897 --> 15:00.765
- Uh-huh.
What else you got?

15:00.767 --> 15:01.999
- That's it.
- That's it?

15:02.001 --> 15:05.569
That's the "totality
of your karate mastery"?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.204
- Well, squidward,
I've only been studying

15:07.206 --> 15:10.508
A couple of years,
but if total karate knowledge

15:10.510 --> 15:11.242
Is what you seek--

15:11.244 --> 15:13.644
- Then you should visit
sensei cheeks.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.579
- Hey, I was just
going to say that!

15:15.581 --> 15:16.580
- I know.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.517
[both laugh]
- oh, boy.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.584
- I don't know, spongebob.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.720
With the rubbery arms
and the doughiness

15:22.722 --> 15:23.888
In this area,
we obviously--

15:23.890 --> 15:25.423
- All right, already.
We've been through this.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.225
Are you going to teach me
how to get revenge

15:28.227 --> 15:29.360
On my attacker or what?

15:29.362 --> 15:31.529
- Whoa-ho-ho.
Karate ain't for revenge.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.398
It's a delicate art
that helps you protect yourself.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.835
- Yeah, fine.
- Great, repeat after me.

15:37.837 --> 15:38.869
Hi-yah!

15:38.871 --> 15:41.005
- Hi-yah!

15:41.007 --> 15:42.973
- Oh, whatever.

15:42.975 --> 15:43.707
Hi-yah.

15:43.709 --> 15:48.446
- I promise to use karate
only for protection

15:48.448 --> 15:50.381
And not for revenge.

15:50.383 --> 15:54.218
- I promise to use karate
only for protection

15:54.220 --> 15:56.787
And not for revenge.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.489
Or whatever.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.190
- Okay, then.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.459
Let's get started
with a little chopping.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.426
Like so.

16:02.428 --> 16:03.861
Hi-yah!

16:05.931 --> 16:08.232
- Whoa.

16:08.234 --> 16:08.966
- A board?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.968
I wasn't attacked
by a piece of wood.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.537
I was assaulted
by a deranged lunatic.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.306
- The only way
you'll protect yourself

16:15.308 --> 16:16.874
Is if you know
the basics.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.008
Now give it a chop.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.945
- [sighs] whatever
you say, sensei.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.079
- This is a tough one,
squidward.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.447
Don't feel bad
if you can't do it.

16:23.449 --> 16:27.685
- I'm sure I can
break one little twig.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.221
Hi-yah!

16:31.690 --> 16:32.923
[crack]

16:32.925 --> 16:34.024
[splash]

16:34.026 --> 16:35.793
- Arms up, squidward.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.995
Block! Block!

16:39.498 --> 16:40.531
Block! Block!

16:40.533 --> 16:41.932
- [grumbles]
this is stupid.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.934
The only thing this maniac
threw at me

16:43.936 --> 16:46.537
Were his big, meaty fists.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.872
[grumbles]

16:47.874 --> 16:48.506
- Block!

16:48.508 --> 16:50.508
- Now that's how you do it.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.877
- Dimwit's luck.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.346
[grumbles]
- come on, squiddy.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.448
Give it the old roundhouse.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.782
- All right.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.651
Hi-yah!

17:00.653 --> 17:02.820
[yelping]

17:02.822 --> 17:03.754
Aah!

17:03.756 --> 17:05.388
This isn't working.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.358
My assailant
was twice as tall.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.294
And his shoulders
were 20 times as broad.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.731
The furrows of his brow
were the size of biceps.

17:13.733 --> 17:14.565
- Hmm.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.634
We're going to have
to make this more personal

17:16.636 --> 17:17.401
For you, squidward,

17:17.403 --> 17:20.237
So as to help you
bring out your inner dragon.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.105
Spongebob?

17:21.107 --> 17:23.007
- Hey, grocery boy!

17:23.009 --> 17:25.608
It is me,
a big, scary miscreant.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.744
Now hand over
that sack of groceries

17:27.747 --> 17:29.580
Before things get ugly.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.381
- Groceries?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.016
You'll have to pull
my groceries

17:32.018 --> 17:35.152
From my cold,
wet tentacles, bucko.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.487
Take this!

17:36.489 --> 17:38.756
Hi-yah!

17:38.758 --> 17:39.323
Huh?

17:39.325 --> 17:40.291
Think that's going to stop me?

17:40.293 --> 17:42.726
You're not getting me
without a fight!

17:42.728 --> 17:45.429
Hi-yah!

17:45.431 --> 17:48.365
[struggling]

17:48.367 --> 17:52.836
Got you right
where I want you.

17:53.538 --> 17:57.007
Vengeance is mine.

17:57.009 --> 17:57.641
- "vengeance"?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.677
Squidward tentacles,
I told you at the beginning

17:59.679 --> 18:01.879
That karate
ain't for revenge.

18:01.881 --> 18:02.646
Sorry, squidward.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.916
As of now,
I ain't your sensei no more.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.686
- Sandy, wait!
[struggles]

18:08.688 --> 18:11.655
I need you to teach--

18:13.191 --> 18:14.658
Oh, this is pointless.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.894
I'll never be able
to protect myself.

18:16.896 --> 18:21.398
I may as well just start handing
my groceries to criminals.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.801
"here, please,
mr. Criminal.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.737
Take my unprocessed
kale cream."

18:26.739 --> 18:28.005
- Sandy, wait.

18:28.007 --> 18:28.906
Please, help him.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.475
He just wants to keep
his organic blue algae safe.

18:31.477 --> 18:34.578
- He's going to use my teachings
for revenge, spongebob.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.481
- Please, sandy,
I'll do anything!

18:37.483 --> 18:38.616
- Oh, really?

18:38.618 --> 18:41.919
Well, squidward,
a wise sensei once told me

18:41.921 --> 18:45.055
One must first know
the movements of every day

18:45.057 --> 18:48.525
Before mastering karate.

18:52.797 --> 18:56.800
[button clicking]

18:56.802 --> 18:58.836
- [grumbles]

18:58.838 --> 19:01.905
[vacuum hums]

19:01.907 --> 19:02.773
Whew!

19:02.775 --> 19:04.208
All finished.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.776
- Wow!
This looks great.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.846
- Psst.
You missed a spot.

19:14.152 --> 19:18.055
- All right, I reckon the yard
is good and watered.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.990
- Psst.
You missed a spot.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.326
- [grumbles]

19:24.229 --> 19:26.630
Whew.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.067
- Atta boy, squiddy.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.369
Be sure to twist that torso.

19:32.371 --> 19:33.537
- Hey, sandy.

19:33.539 --> 19:36.106
I don't remember this
being a part of my training.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.308
It wasn't,
but today is chore day.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.779
So I figured why not
fry two fish in one skillet.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.913
[both laugh]

19:42.915 --> 19:45.983
- That's it.
I am outta here!

19:45.985 --> 19:49.453
This is a no good
waste of my time.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.288
[yelps]

19:51.990 --> 19:53.123
Hey, I'm doing it.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.324
I'm blocking the acorns.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.660
- Yee-haw!
I told you all you had to do

19:56.662 --> 19:59.930
Was know the movements
of every day to master karate.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.865
- [laughs]
I can't believe I did it!

20:01.867 --> 20:03.434
- Yeah! Yeah!
Now try this!

20:03.436 --> 20:04.601
- Okay,
okay.

20:04.603 --> 20:05.869
Hi-yah!

20:06.971 --> 20:09.873
- [laughs]
I did it!

20:11.242 --> 20:13.877
Hi-yah!

20:13.879 --> 20:16.780
I can protect
my groceries now!

20:16.782 --> 20:18.248
Hi-yah!

20:18.250 --> 20:20.451
[crash]

20:20.453 --> 20:22.953
I am a karate master.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.388
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

20:24.390 --> 20:26.056
- Well,
I wouldn't go that far,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.058
But you have proven
yourself worthy of

20:28.060 --> 20:30.994
The belt
of basic competence.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.062
- Yeah, yeah.
That's great, thanks.

20:32.064 --> 20:36.967
But I have some business
to attend to.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.268
- [laughs]

20:38.270 --> 20:38.836
What's this?

20:38.838 --> 20:42.539
Do I find myself on this
dark and scary street

20:42.541 --> 20:43.207
Yet again?

20:43.209 --> 20:48.579
We'll just see
what happens this time.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.247
- Hey, you!

20:50.249 --> 20:53.484
- Let me give a taste,
a mere morsel

20:53.486 --> 20:55.018
Or what's in store.

20:55.020 --> 20:58.155
Hi-yah!
Hi-yah!

20:58.157 --> 20:58.789
Hi-yah!

20:58.791 --> 21:03.894
That one was called
"washing sandy's windows".

21:04.596 --> 21:07.498
Stay back
or you're going to get it.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.166
I am warning you.

21:09.168 --> 21:11.602
- [wheezing]

21:11.604 --> 21:13.036
- Okay, buddy.
I warned you.

21:13.038 --> 21:17.341
I like to call this one
"taking out sandy's trash".

21:17.343 --> 21:18.809
Hi-yah!

21:18.811 --> 21:20.344
- What? Ow!

21:20.346 --> 21:21.011
- [laughs]

21:21.013 --> 21:22.880
How do you like
them apples?

21:22.882 --> 21:24.615
Waah!

21:24.617 --> 21:26.049
- Oh! Ow!

21:26.051 --> 21:28.485
- Ha, feel my wrath.

21:28.487 --> 21:29.953
How's your uncle?

21:29.955 --> 21:31.321
- Ow! Ow.

21:31.323 --> 21:34.992
- And, as my finishing move,
I give you

21:34.994 --> 21:37.795
"watering sandy's lawn".

21:37.797 --> 21:39.596
Bee-yah!

21:43.535 --> 21:44.234
- [groans]

21:44.236 --> 21:47.104
Hey, man.
Wh-what was that for?

21:47.106 --> 21:48.705
I was just trying to
give you back

21:48.707 --> 21:51.008
Your groceries
you dropped.

21:51.010 --> 21:51.608
- Uh, oh.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.211
- Sandy, I found him.
He's over here.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.747
You forgot
your belt, silly.

21:56.749 --> 21:57.714
[gasps]

21:57.716 --> 21:59.683
- Gosh,
what happened to you?

21:59.685 --> 22:02.019
- This guy's been karate'd.

22:02.021 --> 22:06.824
- After all I said about never
using karate for revenge?

22:06.826 --> 22:10.127
- For shame, squidward.
For shame.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.596
- Looks like he's not worthy
of this belt after all.

22:12.598 --> 22:17.100
Thanks for dishonoring
our trust in you, squidward.

22:17.102 --> 22:20.938
- Whatever.
I'm still a karate master.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.940
- Wow, really?
You are?

22:22.942 --> 22:24.041
- Yes, I am.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.276
- Hey, watch your head.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.311
I'd never guess it.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.780
- And what is that
supposed to mean?

22:29.782 --> 22:30.814
- Oh, uh, nothing.

22:30.816 --> 22:31.882
Just with the rubbery arms,

22:31.884 --> 22:34.084
And the doughiness
in the midsection--

22:34.086 --> 22:35.919
- Okay, already,
I get it.

22:35.921 --> 22:39.189
What, wait a second.
Am I under arrest?

22:39.191 --> 22:39.957
- You sure are.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.860
And you have the right
to remain silent...

22:42.862 --> 22:44.828
- [screams]

22:44.830 --> 22:46.563
- Or not silent.
