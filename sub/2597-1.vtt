00:46.040 --> 00:49.283
As you may
well know, I am many things.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.489
An arts dealer, an accomplished fencer,

00:52.600 --> 00:55.126
fair shot with most weapons.

00:55.240 --> 00:59.723
I am loved and respected
by all who know me...

01:00.120 --> 01:01.485
Slightly.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.641
But I have always felt

01:06.760 --> 01:08.922
there's something missing, you see.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.321
Some final piece of my personal puzzle.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.927
I needed something bold, distinctive.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.240
Ah, thank you.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.084
The work of art with which

01:18.160 --> 01:20.606
I could declare to the heavens,

01:20.680 --> 01:23.684
I am Lord Charlie Mortdecai,

01:23.800 --> 01:28.089
and this little bit of magic

01:28.640 --> 01:30.608
is my mustache.

01:34.920 --> 01:35.921
I see.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.606
Shall we to business then, Fang?

01:39.920 --> 01:41.809
Would you mind?

01:44.600 --> 01:46.329
"Find," you said.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.810
Mmm, and find, I have done.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.281
The Qianlong vase.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.211
Very, very rare.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.169
Low-fired with an immersion glaze?

02:09.039 --> 02:10.280
None of the southern

02:10.400 --> 02:11.890
Yangtze ceramics are low-fired.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.685
But you know that.
You're testing me.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.402
I'm so terribly sorry.
Mosquito. You see it?

02:20.680 --> 02:22.887
Why don't you test the vase instead?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.490
I am sure that you will agree

02:24.560 --> 02:26.881
it is a bargain at two million pounds.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.729
Everyone knows you're broke.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.241
You will take one million.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.001
Ooh.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.686
Golly, that was a big one!

02:38.880 --> 02:41.042
Well, have it your way, Fang.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.210
One million pounds.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.766
I trust that you have, um,
brought the treasuries?

02:54.560 --> 02:56.449
I think I'll keep the money.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.921
And the vase.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.602
You cheated me in our last deal.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.130
I paid three million for that tapestry,

03:06.760 --> 03:09.684
then found out it is worth only one!

03:13.720 --> 03:17.691
You took from me.
Now I will take from you.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.203
Now, you look here, Fang! Fat. Fang Fat.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.123
I'm an art dealer, not a charlatan.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.811
A rogue, perhaps, a scamp

03:28.880 --> 03:30.291
or scoundrel, I will grant you.

03:30.360 --> 03:34.046
But never an outright mountebank.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.121
Enough!

03:36.120 --> 03:37.406
You owe me.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.809
I believe a finger would be fair.
Don't you?

03:40.880 --> 03:42.086
No!

03:43.480 --> 03:44.561
Oh!

03:44.800 --> 03:45.801
Jock!

03:49.720 --> 03:52.007
I wouldn't, mate.
I really wouldn't.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.084
Jockie, thank heavens!
Where have you been, man?

03:57.160 --> 03:59.003
Right behind you as always, sir.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.161
Ahh!

04:15.000 --> 04:16.081
Jock!

04:20.079 --> 04:21.764
Well done, Jockie.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.204
It's a privilege, sir!

04:44.880 --> 04:46.041
Jock, you're ablaze!

04:55.680 --> 04:57.808
Well, I think our work here is done.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.405
- Time to go, sir.
- Ah.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.246
<i>Jock laid out the state</i>

05:08.360 --> 05:10.328
<i>of our financial affairs.</i>

05:10.400 --> 05:12.721
<i>Basically, they involved debt.</i>

05:13.040 --> 05:15.008
<i>Massive, crushing debt.</i>

05:16.200 --> 05:17.486
<i>We hurried back to Mortdecai Manor,</i>

05:17.560 --> 05:19.722
<i>where my beloved wife, Johanna,</i>

05:19.880 --> 05:22.406
<i>having heard of our financial distress,</i>

05:22.520 --> 05:23.760
<i>was arriving home</i>

05:23.840 --> 05:26.207
<i>to sell off some of my prized possessions.</i>

05:27.080 --> 05:29.481
<i>Even my horsey picture was on the block.</i>

05:31.040 --> 05:33.930
<i>But I was hopeful my new moustache</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:35.240
<i>would cheer her up.</i>

05:35.320 --> 05:36.446
Darling!

05:37.000 --> 05:39.321
Oh, God, I missed you terribly.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.171
<i>Johanna. Love of my life.</i>

05:42.240 --> 05:43.765
<i>Apple of my eye.</i>

05:43.840 --> 05:45.000
I so wish you had been there.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.440
Can you imagine the two of us

05:48.520 --> 05:50.010
in that frigid city,

05:50.120 --> 05:51.610
only our passions keeping us...

05:51.760 --> 05:54.286
Whoa! What is that?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.125
Just a little something I cooked up

05:56.200 --> 05:57.611
whilst you were away, my darling.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.770
I do believe it was Maggie Thatcher

05:59.920 --> 06:01.206
who said that kissing a man without

06:01.280 --> 06:06.446
a moustache is rather like
eating an egg without salt.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.722
Oh, don't point that thing at me.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.881
Told ya.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.362
I have put no inconsiderable thought

06:13.440 --> 06:15.363
and effort into this endeavor.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.568
You see, the domain of a man's upper lip

06:17.640 --> 06:18.880
is his sovereign ground...

06:18.960 --> 06:20.485
You have five minutes to shave it off.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.963
Every Mortdecai man before me had the same.
Why can't I?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.723
Oh, I happen to be terribly fond of it,

06:30.800 --> 06:35.567
and I have had every intention
of seeing it through.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.090
You mean it's going to get bigger?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.921
It will come to fruition, yes.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.482
Oh, darling...

06:44.560 --> 06:45.846
Mmm.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.483
You really won't shave it off?

06:49.160 --> 06:50.685
Oh...

06:50.800 --> 06:53.610
I can't, my duck. Not at this juncture.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.331
It's not even fully corked. It's a baby.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.282
- Jock?
- Yes, madam?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.601
Please, will you make up

07:00.680 --> 07:02.762
the guest bedroom for Mr. Mortdecai?

07:02.840 --> 07:04.365
Already have, madam.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.528
And I shan't be having dinner
downstairs this evening.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.604
I'll just have a supper tray in my room.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.761
Very good, madam.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.006
Oh...

07:14.360 --> 07:15.771
I do believe Jock has informed you

07:15.840 --> 07:19.322
that we are staring down
the barrel of insolvency.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.363
What do you plan to do about it?

07:21.440 --> 07:23.886
Right. Yes, well...

07:24.120 --> 07:27.966
That... Well... Quite.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.851
First thing we're doing
is selling off that Sheridan.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.808
Oh, my sweet little love beast,

07:36.880 --> 07:39.963
I am sure that we will
come up with the necessary funds

07:40.040 --> 07:42.000
by the end of the month.
What is today, the fifth!

07:42.040 --> 07:43.280
The 26th, sir.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.731
All right. That gives us six...

07:44.800 --> 07:45.801
Four days, sir.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.405
Jock?
Please can you take the Sheridan

07:47.520 --> 07:48.806
up to London in the morning?

07:48.880 --> 07:50.803
I'm entering it in the
Autumn Masters Auction.

07:50.880 --> 07:51.881
Right you are, madam.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.889
Come, come.
Let's not be rash.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.325
Oh, hello, Poppet.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.971
We cannot go about
selling off family heirlooms willy-nilly.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.402
I'm afraid I shall have to
put my foot down, darling.

08:01.520 --> 08:02.567
Sorry?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.925
With your permission, of course.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.650
Bugger it.
Oh, there he is.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.401
Mmm.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.002
She'll come around, Jock.
How could she not?

08:16.080 --> 08:17.684
She's only human, sir.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.682
<i>A quick aside about Jock.</i>

08:20.760 --> 08:23.331
<i>In addition to being my
manservant and thug,</i>

08:23.760 --> 08:26.240
<i>he also maintains an enviable rate</i>

08:26.400 --> 08:28.050
<i>of sexual intercourse,</i>

08:29.560 --> 08:32.166
<i>which can be occasionally problematic.</i>

08:32.280 --> 08:35.363
<i>Recently, after we'd concluded
the sale of a painting</i>

08:35.440 --> 08:37.283
<i>To a wealthy turkey farmer...</i>

08:39.120 --> 08:40.201
What was that?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.530
Get your head down, sir.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.284
What have you done now, man?

08:45.440 --> 08:46.680
Ohh!

08:46.760 --> 08:48.410
Onward, Jock! Onward!

08:48.600 --> 08:50.204
Don't shoot, farmer!

08:50.280 --> 08:52.123
Dad! What the hell are you doing?

08:54.280 --> 08:56.442
Jock! Jock, wait! Jock!

08:56.960 --> 08:58.530
I have me own apartment!

08:58.640 --> 09:01.962
Crikey, man! The farmer's daughter?

09:02.080 --> 09:04.128
I only gave her the once-over.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.486
Where do you find the time?

09:05.600 --> 09:07.284
Sorry, twice-over.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.962
<i>Dear, sweet, simple Jock.</i>

09:12.080 --> 09:14.321
<i>Every man should have a Jock,
don't you think?</i>

09:20.160 --> 09:23.164
<i>Meanwhile, not far away,</i>

09:23.760 --> 09:26.161
<i>our fortunes were about
to become intertwined</i>

09:26.240 --> 09:30.165
<i>with one of the art world's
greatest mysteries.</i>

09:33.480 --> 09:35.164
<i>And a dead hag.</i>

09:40.680 --> 09:41.681
Bull's-eye.

09:51.520 --> 09:55.127
Miss Bronwen?
Everything all right?

10:30.560 --> 10:31.971
Get back behind the tape!

10:32.880 --> 10:35.690
Excuse me.
This is a crime scene.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.801
Hello?

10:39.800 --> 10:41.245
Who is this guy?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.566
You and your men have done

10:42.680 --> 10:44.967
an admirable job stomping
all over the place.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.048
Your services are no longer required.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.088
Sorry, Inspector Martland, sir.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.927
Sorry, sir. I had no idea, sir.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.004
Can I have all Thames
Valley police officers

11:00.080 --> 11:01.320
back in their cars, please?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.721
There's been a jurisdictional change.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.527
That painting could be
anywhere by now, sir.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.285
Yes, I suppose it could.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.447
You know we're going to

11:19.560 --> 11:20.686
have to ring him, don't you, sir?

11:20.760 --> 11:22.364
No, I do not know that, Maurice.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.521
No one knows the filthy underside

11:23.600 --> 11:24.681
of the art world better than he, sir.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.444
He is the filthy underside.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.284
Why did it have to be art?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.887
<i>Inspector Alastair Martland.</i>

11:35.120 --> 11:36.690
<i>MI5.</i>

11:36.800 --> 11:38.962
<i>Martland and I met at Oxford.</i>

11:39.040 --> 11:40.451
<i>Once in a while I provide him</i>

11:40.520 --> 11:41.965
<i>With some off-the-record help</i>

11:42.040 --> 11:45.123
<i>with the seedier side of art collecting.</i>

11:45.240 --> 11:50.929
<i>And in exchange, he gives me
a wide berth to ply my craft.</i>

11:51.480 --> 11:55.201
<i>He is also desperately
in love with my wife.</i>

11:55.800 --> 11:56.926
<i>Rather annoying, really.</i>

11:58.600 --> 11:59.726
What?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.802
Inspector Martland, sir.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.809
What does that blighter want?

12:04.720 --> 12:05.801
Tell him to ring back

12:05.880 --> 12:07.166
when my marriage isn't falling apart.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.645
No, he's here, sir.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.250
He is?

12:10.320 --> 12:12.641
Oh, all right.
Wheel him in.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.481
Don't get up.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.244
I wasn't going to.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.086
Beware the carafe on the top shelf.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.241
It contains water.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.246
<i>Ignoring some of the more</i>

12:25.320 --> 12:26.845
<i>inviting bottles on the drinks tray,</i>

12:26.920 --> 12:28.922
<i>he reached underneath for the big decanter,</i>

12:29.000 --> 12:30.161
<i>and poured himself</i>

12:30.240 --> 12:34.006
<i>a gross amount of what
he thought was my Taylor '31.</i>

12:34.120 --> 12:36.327
<i>Score one for Mortdecai,</i>

12:36.440 --> 12:38.602
<i>for I had filled it with an invalid port</i>

12:38.680 --> 12:40.921
<i>of unbelievable nastiness.</i>

12:41.000 --> 12:42.286
Oh, excellent.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.771
<i>Score two.</i>

12:43.840 --> 12:45.683
Bit of cheese to go with that?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.763
I should think the special one, Jock.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.648
What is that infernal thing on your lip?

13:06.200 --> 13:07.725
Is there a purpose to your presence?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.048
You're in the hole
to Her Majesty's government

13:10.120 --> 13:12.885
to the tune of eight million quid, old boy.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.285
I had no idea I was so deep
in Her Majesty's hole.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.804
God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God...

13:39.320 --> 13:40.731
That's not natural.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.091
What do you think?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.526
Ugh...

13:48.520 --> 13:51.000
I think this woman has
need of a chiropractor.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.242
Bronwen Fellworthy, Oxford art restorer.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.367
Did you know her?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.726
Slightly.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.171
I do recall a vague memory
of her having once,

13:59.240 --> 14:01.447
involuntarily, one would hope,

14:02.760 --> 14:04.444
releasing a fart

14:04.520 --> 14:06.887
of such frightening power and timbre

14:07.720 --> 14:09.609
that I feared she had done herself

14:09.680 --> 14:11.125
a horrible mischief.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.401
Cheese.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.401
Mmm, thank you.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.523
Three months ago, a small Spanish museum

14:27.600 --> 14:30.046
sent her a Goya to be cleaned.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.602
Last night she was killed.
Painting has disappeared.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.961
Sad news, particularly for her.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.811
But I don't see what it
has to do with me.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.491
Well, if my men start asking questions,

14:42.600 --> 14:44.329
then the Goya disappears without a trace.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.324
But you, a known trafficker of stolen art, well,

14:47.400 --> 14:49.323
you could make some inquiries.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.042
Why would MI5 be interested

14:52.160 --> 14:53.969
in the theft of a middling Goya?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.890
Mmm.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.401
Emil Strago.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.402
Fundamentalist, revolutionary,
trained in Syria,

15:03.480 --> 15:06.927
fought in Senegal.
An expert in special warfare.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.081
He's linked to a number of

15:08.160 --> 15:09.600
terror attacks all around the world.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.322
All right, he's unpleasant. What of him?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.243
Well, we believe he entered the country

15:14.320 --> 15:17.085
with the purpose of finding that painting.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.242
- Why?
- We don't know why.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.084
But if Strago is involved, well,

15:21.160 --> 15:22.161
suffice it to say,

15:22.280 --> 15:24.760
it's a matter of urgent national security.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.526
And you would like me
to find it before he does?

15:29.440 --> 15:30.771
Precisely.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.371
I've given you a lot of rope
over the years, Charlie.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.681
But now you're dangling off the end of it.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.523
Help me find that painting,

15:40.640 --> 15:42.688
or I'll have the magistrate open that file

15:42.760 --> 15:44.046
and prosecute at random.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.360
<i>It was a catalogue</i>

15:45.480 --> 15:48.290
<i>of some of my more unseemly escapades.</i>

15:48.360 --> 15:50.601
<i>The file was fat and well-handled,</i>

15:50.720 --> 15:52.484
<i>like a Welsh barmaid.</i>

15:53.880 --> 15:56.804
It is apparent that you are
well-versed in the stick.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.565
But what of the well-known carrot?

16:01.480 --> 16:03.050
What's in it for me, as they say?

16:03.160 --> 16:04.321
Good God, man!

16:04.480 --> 16:06.642
We're talking about a
bloodthirsty extremist

16:06.720 --> 16:08.688
Threatening the lives of your countrymen.

16:09.800 --> 16:10.961
Well, if you won't do it for me,

16:11.040 --> 16:12.405
do it for Queen and Country.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.245
No!

16:15.360 --> 16:16.725
All right, Queen and Country,

16:16.840 --> 16:18.729
travel and living expenses,
reasonable overhead.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.241
Ten percent, sir.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.483
And 10 percent of the insurance money

16:23.560 --> 16:24.721
as a finder's fee.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.201
Done.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.926
Oh, and incidentally,
I asked for some cheese,

16:30.040 --> 16:32.771
not an instrument of biological warfare.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.767
Score one for Martland.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.766
- Martland...
- God.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.922
...what else can you tell me about Strago?

16:43.760 --> 16:46.604
Well, he's colorblind
and he's allergic to cashews.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.924
Goody. Every subject of the Crown and

16:49.040 --> 16:51.008
every cashew in the Kingdom
shall sleep safely.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.600
Johanna, you look lovely.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.561
Alastair.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.090
Ooh, you do look lovely, darling.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.089
So absolutely lovely.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.885
I thought that was you.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.441
Radiant...

17:03.080 --> 17:05.401
<i>Martland
also met Johanna at school.</i>

17:06.560 --> 17:07.720
<i>After a three-year courtship,</i>

17:07.760 --> 17:09.285
<i>he finally worked up the courage</i>

17:09.359 --> 17:11.442
<i>to express his feelings to her.</i>

17:12.359 --> 17:14.124
<i>In verse.</i>

17:14.440 --> 17:15.930
- Johanna, do you...
- Oh!

17:16.440 --> 17:18.282
<i>Rotten timing for him.</i>

17:18.520 --> 17:20.089
- Hello!
- Martland.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.767
Would you mind terribly,
dear boy, the door?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.602
Course, I'll just, uh...
I'll shut the door.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.801
Now, what's all this about a missing Goya?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.801
Oh, it's the house. Terribly vast.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.331
Echo-ey, don't you know?

17:35.280 --> 17:37.408
Well, that's classified
information, I'm afraid.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.050
You know, state secrets and what have you.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.241
Mmm.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.482
My husband is trying to reclaim his youth

17:42.600 --> 17:44.250
by growing that horrible moustache.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.641
Do inform him that that ship has sailed.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.128
Every Mortdecai man before me has had one.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.322
And I will have you know that some members

17:51.400 --> 17:53.926
of the fairer sex do
find it quite appealing.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.569
Whom exactly?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.321
No one in particular, of course.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.086
Metaphoric woman... Women.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.604
Metaphorically... General... You know.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.526
If you are growing that
excrement on your lip

18:12.640 --> 18:14.005
to please another, know this:

18:14.600 --> 18:15.647
I will kill her.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.686
Oh, Alastair.
It's so lovely. Do come back.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.365
It's so wonderful to have someone

18:22.440 --> 18:24.602
of reasonable intelligence
to converse with.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.165
I'd be delighted.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.762
Do I detect a slight crack
in the marital armor?

18:31.200 --> 18:33.123
A mere tiff, old bean. Nothing more.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.368
Oh, really?
Seems like more than a tiff to me.

18:35.840 --> 18:36.966
My wife needs to come around

18:37.040 --> 18:39.008
to a certain viewpoint. That is all.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.645
Well, good luck, mate.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.201
See what you can dig up about that Goya.
Usual channels.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.441
We'll meet in London tomorrow.

18:45.560 --> 18:46.561
Of course.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.122
I had the painting in my hand.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.009
Someone must have known I was coming.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.889
Milton Krampf?
The American?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.490
Well, it must have been his dealer.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.929
Krampf's dealer, what is his name?

19:12.040 --> 19:13.530
Mortdecai.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.845
Johanna, my darling.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.366
My... My love. My...

19:28.000 --> 19:31.891
My only true love.
My love beast.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.765
My rumpus room rascal.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.690
Ooh, you have no idea

19:36.760 --> 19:38.888
the beast you are about to receive.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.886
Mmm...

19:45.760 --> 19:46.886
Johanna?

19:48.240 --> 19:50.049
Are you all right in there, darling?

19:51.960 --> 19:55.760
It is I, Charlie.
Your husband.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.441
What is it?

19:59.680 --> 20:02.968
Oh, moon of my delight.
This is your own personalized

20:03.120 --> 20:06.442
Sheik of Araby who seeks
admission into your tent.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.447
I have come to carry you off
to the burning desert,

20:09.640 --> 20:11.722
and work my greasy will upon you...

20:13.280 --> 20:14.645
...under the tropical stars.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.970
Send your camel to bed, damn it!

20:19.760 --> 20:23.242
My Sheik, does this mean
you have excommunicated

20:23.440 --> 20:24.965
that moustache of the Prophet?

20:27.800 --> 20:29.131
I'll trim it.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.561
Darling,

20:34.480 --> 20:37.768
I am embarking on a very dangerous escapade

20:38.000 --> 20:40.571
from which I may not well return.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.004
And it is customary in these situations

20:43.120 --> 20:44.485
for, you know,

20:46.120 --> 20:47.167
a proper send-off.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.480
Quick session of congress.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.010
Sink the <i>Bismarck,</i> if you will.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.689
And by the way, did I mention

20:57.120 --> 21:00.010
it is a matter of national security.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.001
Mmm.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.851
It's very difficult for me as well, you know,

21:11.960 --> 21:13.689
this thing that's come between us.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.204
I know, darling.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.521
- Mmm.
- No, no. Steady yourself.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.724
I beg you, darling, please.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.802
You know I have a sympathetic gag reflex.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.367
Oh, God. It's unbearable.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.960
You will get used to it. I promise.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.371
Why should I have to?

21:36.840 --> 21:38.330
I'm invested in it.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.404
Why can't you invest
in saving us from financial ruin?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.562
Or do you want me
to sort it out for you?

21:45.720 --> 21:49.042
Heavens, no.
You needn't worry yourself.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.845
I have things firmly in hand.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.041
Oh...

22:03.320 --> 22:04.765
My love, you are killing me. Please.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.243
It looked like you have
a vagina on your face.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.360
Surely you mean
the pubic hair above a vagina.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.603
I simply cannot get my head
around that image.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.091
Oh, Charlie...

22:18.240 --> 22:19.401
However,

22:20.760 --> 22:22.000
now that you've mentioned it,

22:22.080 --> 22:25.527
I'm unable to steer my mind away from it.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.683
Ugh, go stuff a mattress with that thing!

22:30.880 --> 22:32.450
The moustache, I mean.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.520
...Sheamus is able to do

22:39.600 --> 22:41.125
<i>with a steel chair in hand.</i>

22:41.280 --> 22:42.361
Here we go.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.971
Oh...

22:44.920 --> 22:46.126
Jockie,

22:46.600 --> 22:49.968
What if it isn't just a tiff?

22:50.760 --> 22:54.128
What if this is the
well-known "it," as it were?

22:54.440 --> 22:55.805
That'd be awful.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.565
Jock?

22:58.800 --> 23:00.131
Are you coming back to bed?

23:03.280 --> 23:04.645
Yeah, give us a minute, love.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.961
Hi.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.487
Hello.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.406
And myself sleeping alone.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.007
How do you think this
makes me feel, man?

23:21.160 --> 23:22.241
I dunno, sir.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.248
Dash it all, I am resolved.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.401
If it is money we need,

23:26.480 --> 23:27.925
then it is money we shall have.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.161
Jock?

23:29.920 --> 23:31.285
That's me.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.245
Tomorrow we shall sell off the Rolls

23:35.320 --> 23:38.324
to that vulgar American, Milton Krampf,

23:38.840 --> 23:42.606
and we will find that painting
if it is the last thing we do.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.681
Right-y-oh.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.006
I'll call Spinoza in the morning.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.809
- Yes, do.
- Good night, sir.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.161
Jock?

23:48.960 --> 23:49.960
Yes, sir?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.002
Do you think it will be
all right in the end?

23:52.440 --> 23:53.851
I couldn't say, sir.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.171
Mmm...

24:11.720 --> 24:14.326
<i>My first stop was
to see Sir Graham Archer,</i>

24:14.520 --> 24:17.490
<i>rival art dealer and Goya specialist.</i>

24:18.640 --> 24:19.801
<i>A permanent fixture at</i>

24:19.880 --> 24:22.042
<i>Sedgwick's Auction House in Kensington.</i>

24:24.720 --> 24:26.802
I will meet you at
Spinoza's in one hour.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.211
Right you are, sir.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.166
<i>Sir Graham has been</i>

24:41.240 --> 24:43.402
<i>the rudest man in England for years.</i>

24:43.800 --> 24:47.327
<i>Recently, he's been working
his way up to the wickedest.</i>

24:51.240 --> 24:54.005
Looks like something
curled up and died on your lip.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.929
It's not herpetic, I hope.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.242
Hello, Sir Graham, you old member.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.762
Ooh! Who are you hiding in your belly?

25:01.160 --> 25:02.844
I see you've put your Sheridan up

25:02.920 --> 25:04.251
in next week's sale.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.410
Hard times, old boy?

25:06.600 --> 25:07.761
No, no, no, no.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.370
Just getting rid of some choice items

25:09.440 --> 25:10.601
while the market's right.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.851
What do you make of
this Bronwen business, eh?

25:13.920 --> 25:16.446
Huh. Ghastly affair.

25:16.520 --> 25:19.046
One always bemoans
the loss of a great restorer.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.044
Old bag.
She should have put locks on her doors.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.124
You used her frequently, didn't you?

25:26.600 --> 25:27.965
Not lately.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.122
She's been unavailable for three months.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.803
The Goya she was cleaning.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.809
Rather simple job, wouldn't you say?

25:37.800 --> 25:40.201
Usual dirt and grime
one finds on the Spaniards.

25:40.760 --> 25:42.808
Haven't the foggiest why
it took her so long.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.245
What's your sudden interest, if I may ask?

25:47.960 --> 25:51.407
A client with a mild curiosity, that's all.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.641
Oh.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.566
Mmm...

25:55.880 --> 25:59.487
We must go shooting again.
Jock has fully recovered.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.320
Ooh.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.170
There's only one reason

26:10.280 --> 26:13.409
you might be interested
in a museum-owned Goya,

26:13.720 --> 26:16.485
and that's because there's money involved.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.844
You are mistaken, sir.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.250
There's a great deal of money involved.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.524
I've always admired your rapacity, sir.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.687
I say, Sir Graham, I wonder,

26:33.800 --> 26:36.531
your, mmm, protrusion...

26:37.360 --> 26:40.762
Might it be
possible to swing the old fellow north,

26:40.840 --> 26:41.966
as it were?

26:46.280 --> 26:47.691
Who's the client?

26:48.680 --> 26:50.603
Terribly sorry, sworn to secrecy.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.290
Perhaps a brisk walk down the stairs

26:55.360 --> 26:58.125
will do some good. Yes.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.651
So it's that sort of Goya.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.041
<i>Romanov.</i>

27:09.040 --> 27:11.566
That painted lady you've
been searching for,

27:12.720 --> 27:15.405
I believe she may be in play.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.565
<i>I want that painting.</i>

27:25.240 --> 27:26.401
Johanna!

27:26.880 --> 27:28.006
Alastair.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.005
So glad you called.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.370
I've asked for a Chardonnay.
That is your drink, isn't it?

27:34.840 --> 27:36.410
- Oh, you remembered.
- Mmm.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.403
Thank you.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.488
Oh, God. How thoughtless of me.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.846
You're on duty.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.766
And in charge, thank you very much.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.321
Mmm.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.243
To what do I owe the pleasure?

27:50.360 --> 27:52.681
I was just in the neighborhood
and thought I'd pop 'round,

27:52.760 --> 27:55.161
and see how
you secret agent men run the world.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.163
Not nearly.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.686
Although it is terribly vital work.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.730
It's not all chardonnay
and afternoon trysts.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.441
Is this a tryst?

28:05.520 --> 28:09.286
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.602
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.127
- No, I was just, um...
- Of course you were.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.121
How are things at home?

28:21.880 --> 28:23.723
You've touched a nerve.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.370
You've sensed it, Alastair.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.124
You always were the sensitive one.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.602
- You've got a difficult chap.
- Beastly.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.046
Bit of a moron, actually.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.083
Maybe I should have an affair.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.443
- Wouldn't that be funny?
- Hilarious.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.485
Do you think I could keep it a secret?

28:37.560 --> 28:39.722
- Yes!
- Well then, what's the point?

28:40.080 --> 28:41.969
Now, tell me, what are you and my husband

28:42.040 --> 28:43.326
working on at the moment?

28:43.760 --> 28:46.809
Oh, uh... Well, in vague terms

28:46.920 --> 28:48.680
there's a very bad man
who wants what I want,

28:48.720 --> 28:49.721
and I'm trying to stop him.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.086
And what does a missing Goya

28:51.160 --> 28:53.481
have to do with national security?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.081
In vague terms.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.490
Johanna...

28:57.560 --> 29:00.325
You think poor
Miss Fellworthy stumbled into something,

29:00.440 --> 29:02.010
and that's why she got killed.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.925
I really can't say.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.163
Oh, this is interesting.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.200
Creates quite a market when a painting

29:08.280 --> 29:10.089
with a little mystery goes missing.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.321
So much to do.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.641
What was the name of
Bronwen's college at Oxford?

29:13.840 --> 29:16.525
Johanna, I simply can't.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.170
Right. Sorry.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.445
Oh, golly. Look at the time.
I really must be going.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.601
Oh.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.920
It was lovely to see you, Alastair.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.446
Thank you ever-so-much
for letting me confide in you.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.002
I feel that I could
share anything with you.

29:32.840 --> 29:36.606
Don't you feel the same?
That you could share with me?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.291
Bronwen's college?

29:39.680 --> 29:40.761
You're rather monstrous.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.120
Of course you're aware of that.

29:42.520 --> 29:45.046
- Blackfriar's Hall.
- We must do this again.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.521
Hopeless.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.482
<i>Besides being
the finest garage man</i>

29:57.560 --> 29:58.891
<i>in Western Civilization,</i>

29:59.320 --> 30:02.802
<i>Spinoza was the best
art smuggler in the business,</i>

30:04.120 --> 30:07.886
<i>and the eyes and ears
of the art world's underbelly.</i>

30:08.880 --> 30:12.885
Ah! Hello, Spinoza, you handsome devil!

30:12.960 --> 30:14.689
It's a fine day to be alive, what?

30:14.880 --> 30:17.008
You bloody chicken, bloody monkey,

30:17.080 --> 30:19.526
so good-for-nothing pot of piss, innit?

30:19.720 --> 30:22.564
Spinoza, you silver-tongued scallywag.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.331
What's the matter with you, eh?

30:24.400 --> 30:27.404
You one book short of a library,
you maggot? Eh?

30:27.560 --> 30:29.005
You one megabyte short of a RAM?

30:29.080 --> 30:30.241
<i>The rest was a bit rude,</i>

30:30.320 --> 30:31.520
<i>so I won't quote him verbatim.</i>

30:31.600 --> 30:33.170
<i>But what vexed him so</i>

30:33.240 --> 30:35.402
<i>was a matter of some
overdue bills on the Rolls,</i>

30:35.520 --> 30:37.522
<i>which I had now asked him to package</i>

30:37.600 --> 30:40.046
<i>and ship off to America on credit.</i>

30:40.760 --> 30:43.081
You mother-loving bastard! Hello.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.521
Right.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.841
Uh, Spinoza, I did not come here to discuss

30:46.920 --> 30:48.843
my relationship with my mother, uh,

30:48.920 --> 30:50.729
nor my relationship to your mother.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.362
Uh, no. We have two items of business.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.602
Item one: The Rolls-Royce,

30:55.720 --> 30:57.848
which I have reluctantly agreed to sell

30:57.920 --> 31:00.685
to that thick-fingered American, Krampf.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.286
Item the second: I need to ascertain

31:05.400 --> 31:08.609
whether any unsavory
types have enlisted you

31:08.720 --> 31:11.246
to smuggle a painting
out of the country recently.

31:11.720 --> 31:16.123
And for your information, I am holding up

31:16.800 --> 31:19.087
a 50-pound note.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.565
Never mind about that.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.723
You should treat a jam jar car like this

31:25.960 --> 31:27.485
with more respect when you drive it

31:27.560 --> 31:29.244
down the frog and toad road.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.721
It's not some Toyota Clitoris.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.121
- No, no.
- No!

31:33.240 --> 31:35.925
Is a Rolls... The bloody Silver,

31:36.280 --> 31:38.726
the whacking Cloud, the bollock Royce!

31:40.000 --> 31:41.411
Someone shooting at the bloody car!

31:41.480 --> 31:43.005
Ooh.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.570
Someone shooting at me!

31:54.840 --> 31:55.966
I'm armed!

32:03.920 --> 32:05.684
- Oh, Jock!
- Yeah.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.841
Oops.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.769
<i>I should probably mention</i>

32:08.840 --> 32:11.161
<i>that this was not
the first time I had shot Jock.</i>

32:12.320 --> 32:15.369
Come on, you little bastards.
Come out and get it.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.207
Oh!

32:24.440 --> 32:28.161
Oh, afraid I'm all thumbs
with these damn things!

32:28.680 --> 32:30.091
Ohh!

32:30.160 --> 32:31.207
Oh.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.810
I believe I've just shot Jock.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.041
Quite.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.007
Man down! Man down!

32:37.200 --> 32:38.645
Could you give me the gun, please?

32:38.720 --> 32:39.801
This bit?

32:39.880 --> 32:41.723
Yes, most... No, no.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.806
Oh, and poor Spinoza...

32:44.960 --> 32:46.883
You should go, sir, before
the shooter circles 'round.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.200
I'll handle things on this end.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.521
Quite.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.565
Cover me, as it were?

32:51.840 --> 32:52.887
Yes, sir.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.724
That's the old feudal spirit, Jock.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.041
Get in.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.210
Oh, dear!

33:01.800 --> 33:03.040
Oh!

33:04.520 --> 33:05.567
Oh, Jock.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.091
- Jock?
- Yeah?

33:07.200 --> 33:08.531
The door? Please?

33:13.160 --> 33:15.686
Right. Gosh, it's been ages.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.366
Goodness, that's awkward.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.680
It's all right, sir.
It's all right.

33:35.760 --> 33:36.841
It's just a cracked rib.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.361
Please, sir, if you wouldn't mind

33:39.440 --> 33:40.640
leaving out the back. On foot.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.125
By myself?

33:42.240 --> 33:43.287
Please, sir. Just leave.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.126
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear...

33:51.240 --> 33:52.446
Oh!

33:52.880 --> 33:53.961
Give me the painting.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.042
What makes
you think I have it?

33:56.280 --> 33:57.725
Give me the painting!

33:58.040 --> 33:59.201
Ooh...

33:59.280 --> 34:01.521
That is a superb Hulihee sans sideburn,

34:01.640 --> 34:02.766
I must say.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.724
I was admiring your Franz Joseph.

34:04.800 --> 34:05.801
Oh, thank you very much.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.043
- Oh!
- I'll have it on my wall.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.281
Jock?

34:12.440 --> 34:14.123
Oh, well done.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.241
What should I do now?

34:17.440 --> 34:18.771
- Run, sir!
- Again?

34:18.960 --> 34:20.449
- Yes!
- Oh...

34:23.560 --> 34:26.005
Run, I shall, like a bloody gazelle!

34:26.280 --> 34:27.725
The Mortdecai men have always

34:27.800 --> 34:29.723
been in tip-top shape, don't you know?

34:30.159 --> 34:31.446
Fit as a fiddle!

34:43.480 --> 34:46.962
Oh, it's burning...
I... I can't go on...

34:52.159 --> 34:53.321
Want to die...

34:54.080 --> 34:55.286
No, I don't.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.361
Sir!

35:01.280 --> 35:02.850
I'm on the bonnet!

35:03.160 --> 35:04.924
Get in the car, sir!

35:08.680 --> 35:10.045
I don't like it!

35:14.520 --> 35:15.681
Oh!

35:16.360 --> 35:17.646
Ah! Oh!

35:17.880 --> 35:19.041
Oh! Hello!

35:28.640 --> 35:30.642
Jockie! Advise?

35:30.960 --> 35:32.849
- Get in the back seat, sir!
- Okay!

35:33.840 --> 35:35.205
Whoa.

35:40.480 --> 35:41.561
Ha! Foreigner!

35:42.400 --> 35:43.686
No!

35:44.040 --> 35:45.405
Out you go!

35:55.040 --> 35:56.246
- Oh, Jock!
- Oh.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.401
Don't worry, sir.
I'm all right.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.481
I am all right.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.006
No, no, man!
My little sproutling.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.089
- What?
- Has it been compromised?

36:15.080 --> 36:16.684
Well done, Jock.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.166
It's a privilege, sir.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.360
Didn't take long for you
to make a mess of things.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.886
Oh, you listen here, you do-gooder!

36:23.080 --> 36:25.447
Your Emil Strago just killed my garage man

36:25.520 --> 36:27.204
and physically assaulted my person.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.607
He seems to think that I have the painting.

36:29.840 --> 36:30.841
What have you found?

36:30.920 --> 36:32.206
Well, I will tell you that

36:32.280 --> 36:34.442
there is more here than meets the eye.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.688
No painting takes three months to clean,

36:36.760 --> 36:38.205
so I believe that Bronwen

36:38.280 --> 36:39.805
was working on the Goya

36:39.880 --> 36:41.882
and discovered something underneath.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.445
I should like to see her
studio immediately.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.210
In the cars, quickly. Maurice, Oxford.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.361
Yes, sir.

36:56.880 --> 36:57.961
<i>I've been
helpin' out Miss Fellworthy</i>

36:58.080 --> 36:59.491
<i>goin' on five years now.</i>

37:00.320 --> 37:02.084
Just keepin' the place tidy and whatnot.

37:03.440 --> 37:06.046
You have been grossly overcompensated.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.441
Her lover was no help.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.530
Lover? Bronwen?

37:09.720 --> 37:10.926
Yeah, a Duke.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.168
No help whatsoever, randy bugger.

37:15.160 --> 37:20.087
"Love... your... Bunny."

37:21.200 --> 37:22.361
Love your Bunny?

37:23.880 --> 37:25.803
A child!
She spawned a child!

37:25.880 --> 37:28.121
The woman bred!
What an odious thought.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.201
Ugh.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.209
- Mmm.
- Don't imbibe the crime scene.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.801
I found her here, sprawled over the table,

37:33.880 --> 37:35.166
with an arrow out of her back.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.441
Course you did, man,

37:36.520 --> 37:37.601
because the assailant fired from here.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.723
- No, from the window.
- With a spear gun.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.888
- With a crossbow.
- He was left-handed.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.923
- Jesus Christ.
- Ha!

37:44.960 --> 37:46.564
Is this how she was found?

37:46.640 --> 37:48.369
- What are you doing?
- Oh, no. To the left a bit.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.602
- Like this?
- Sorry, I meant to the right.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.444
Like this? Like this?

37:52.680 --> 37:54.842
Are you quite finished buggering around?

37:55.480 --> 37:56.845
No.

37:57.360 --> 38:01.331
Because I have a question for you, old bean.

38:01.720 --> 38:04.326
Will I be given a badge,
nestled in some sort of

38:04.520 --> 38:07.603
cheap, leather encasement, just like on telly?

38:07.880 --> 38:09.769
- Maurice?
- Sir?

38:09.840 --> 38:11.683
Show him the photographs. Excuse me.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.884
These were found in her camera.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.322
Yeah, like I told the lady earlier today,

38:17.440 --> 38:18.726
Miss Bronwen would take photos

38:18.800 --> 38:20.564
of each stage of her work, bless her.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.087
Which lady?

38:22.840 --> 38:26.447
Well, the lady with the hair and brain.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.846
I may have
mentioned Bronwen

38:30.920 --> 38:32.206
to Johanna at lunch today.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.489
You were luncheoning with my wife?

38:38.040 --> 38:39.041
Let's look at the photographs.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.610
Yes, let's look at the photographs.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.040
Horrible composition.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.369
Lighting positively medieval.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.562
This one taken by accident,
utterly useless...

38:49.680 --> 38:50.920
Ooh...

38:51.000 --> 38:52.161
Hang on a tic.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.401
That is not your Goya.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.200
What do you mean?

38:57.280 --> 39:00.409
That is not the same
painting as the others.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.727
Where have I seen that hand
before in the background?

39:04.320 --> 39:06.721
Finger pointing down. Ring.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.766
Good Lord!
It couldn't be!

39:10.320 --> 39:11.446
Couldn't be what?

39:12.160 --> 39:13.730
To the library, chaps!

39:16.200 --> 39:17.201
Ah!

39:18.760 --> 39:19.966
There has never been

39:20.040 --> 39:22.008
an accurate reproduction because

39:22.200 --> 39:25.010
it vanished after the unveiling, but

39:25.240 --> 39:27.242
I do remember that there was an etching

39:27.320 --> 39:28.810
or some such hint of...

39:29.000 --> 39:30.684
Ah, there it is.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.325
<i>The Duchess of Wellington.</i>

39:34.320 --> 39:37.324
Bronwen has found the lost Goya.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.849
Goya was commissioned
by Charles IV of Spain

39:40.920 --> 39:42.809
to paint her in 1792.

39:43.640 --> 39:47.008
Uh, she was said to be
his greatest masterpiece.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.886
Unfortunately,

39:49.640 --> 39:53.361
she was also
said to have been the King's mistress.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.329
The Queen was unamused.

39:56.680 --> 39:59.809
<i>Humiliated, she ordered
the painting to be burned.</i>

40:00.040 --> 40:02.441
<i>But instead it was stolen
and secreted away.</i>

40:03.760 --> 40:07.446
<i>Some say that Goya himself
engineered the theft.</i>

40:09.640 --> 40:14.202
For 200 years, the painting
was sought by collectors,

40:14.400 --> 40:15.925
craved by the mighty,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.128
and became the stuff of legend.

40:18.440 --> 40:19.771
And is the legend true?

40:19.960 --> 40:21.246
Does it matter?

40:21.320 --> 40:24.164
The truth is nice,
but a rumor is priceless.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.562
What does Strago want with it?

40:26.640 --> 40:28.160
If it does exist, it belongs to Spain.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.320
If anyone tried to sell it,

40:29.360 --> 40:30.361
they'd be arrested on the spot.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.965
Yes, well, that is where the story

40:32.040 --> 40:33.246
gets interesting, you see.

40:33.960 --> 40:38.648
The Duchess pops up again
in France in 1943,

40:39.360 --> 40:41.488
<i>looted from some sealed room</i>

40:41.560 --> 40:44.370
<i>in an unpronounceable
chateau by the jerrys.</i>

40:44.920 --> 40:46.888
<i>Hermann Goering was said to have been</i>

40:46.960 --> 40:48.041
<i>obsessed with the painting,</i>

40:48.600 --> 40:51.524
<i>and there are rumors
that he inscribed on it</i>

40:51.800 --> 40:55.771
<i>the codes to his numbered
Swiss bank account.</i>

40:56.360 --> 40:59.443
Untold riches and all that, what?

40:59.920 --> 41:00.967
But

41:01.840 --> 41:05.765
when the allies captured Goering...

41:06.000 --> 41:08.287
Out of the way, out of the way.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.440
...there was no mention of the painting.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.364
It had vanished once again into history,

41:15.840 --> 41:18.446
and the secret bank accounts along with it.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.806
What are we talking about here?

41:19.880 --> 41:21.644
Hundreds and hundreds of millions,

41:21.720 --> 41:22.801
surrounded by all that

41:23.040 --> 41:25.964
Gruyere, chocolate, and fine wines.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.605
Well, that's what Emil's after.

41:27.800 --> 41:28.847
The fine wine?

41:28.920 --> 41:31.685
No, the fortune to fund
violent worldwide revolution.

41:31.800 --> 41:32.801
Right!

41:32.880 --> 41:34.644
Multiple attacks over the years to come,

41:34.760 --> 41:36.000
countless lives are at stake.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.043
That painting should be destroyed.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.647
Yeah. Fingers crossed,
chaps, you find it first.

41:41.720 --> 41:42.767
I'm off for a wee.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.881
Ah...

41:48.400 --> 41:49.481
Mmm...

41:51.320 --> 41:53.049
Mmm...

42:04.640 --> 42:06.961
I'm deeply, deeply flattered, young man.

42:07.040 --> 42:11.921
However, I myself do not swing that...

42:12.120 --> 42:14.202
Oh, Golly! I have read about this.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.361
Ohh.

42:18.040 --> 42:20.964
<i>I sunk into an uneasy slumber,</i>

42:21.600 --> 42:25.810
<i>interspersed curiously with erotic dreams.</i>

43:02.880 --> 43:04.928
Lady Mortdecai, the Duke is expecting you.

43:05.840 --> 43:06.921
This way.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.846
Her Lady Mortdecai to see you, Your Grace.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.325
The Duke of Asherboroughdon.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.607
Your Grace. So kind of you to see me.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.406
Lady Mortdecai.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.967
You'll forgive me just a moment, I'm sure?

43:31.280 --> 43:32.691
Of course.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.730
Lady Mortdecai.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.361
Johnson!

43:43.440 --> 43:47.331
Who is this woman Mortdecai
and what does she want? Hmm?

43:47.560 --> 43:49.130
Well, I don't know.
I don't know.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.326
Why wasn't I told?

43:51.240 --> 43:53.242
She's so damned attractive.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.571
Hello? Hello?

43:55.760 --> 43:57.330
Oh...

44:01.840 --> 44:02.841
Water bailiff.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.804
Had to speak to the water bailiff

44:05.880 --> 44:07.484
about my water.

44:08.640 --> 44:12.690
Fishing tomorrow, you know. Hate it. Sit.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.925
Bloody nuisance.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.407
Your Grace,

44:18.480 --> 44:21.245
I understand you were close
with Bronwen Fellworthy.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.965
- Yes.
- I'm very sorry.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.764
Her gardener gave me your name,

44:25.840 --> 44:27.968
and I wondered...

44:28.160 --> 44:29.969
The painting she was
working on in the end...

44:31.680 --> 44:32.727
What?

44:33.840 --> 44:35.604
No, I can't understand a word she says.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.570
I've been trying to get rid of her,

44:37.640 --> 44:39.404
but she's so damned attractive.

44:40.440 --> 44:41.566
Sorry. You were saying?

44:41.760 --> 44:43.524
You served in the War then, Your Grace?

44:43.720 --> 44:44.767
Poor old gal.

44:45.360 --> 44:49.763
Done to death with malice
aforethought and so forth.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.241
Poor Bronwen.

44:52.520 --> 44:54.284
The painting, Your Grace.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.243
Did she ever mention
<i>The Duchess of Wellington?</i>

44:59.440 --> 45:01.124
Oh. Beautiful woman.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.361
Bronwen?

45:02.800 --> 45:04.131
Must to the lavatory.

45:04.760 --> 45:09.004
Would you care to come
and take a peek at it, eh?

45:11.760 --> 45:13.888
An exquisite invitation, Your Grace,

45:13.960 --> 45:15.485
but I'm afraid I must decline.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.290
Let's get back to the Duchess.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.648
- Bunny has it.
- I beg your pardon?

45:19.840 --> 45:22.081
During the War.
Nazi bastards.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.449
Bunny rolled it up
in a carpet and didn't tell a soul.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.005
Bunny is a soldier in your unit?

45:27.240 --> 45:29.288
7th Army, 2nd Division.

45:29.480 --> 45:32.484
Captured Goering.
First man in the room.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.762
Do you think that Bunny
still has the painting now?

45:35.120 --> 45:37.361
Must to the W.C.

45:38.920 --> 45:41.082
Do have a look, eh?

45:41.600 --> 45:43.523
I'm afraid I must be going, Your Grace.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.410
Thank you very much for your time.

45:47.640 --> 45:50.007
And you are?

45:50.960 --> 45:52.689
The water bailiff, Your Grace.

45:53.200 --> 45:54.929
Fishing tomorrow's been canceled.

45:58.600 --> 45:59.647
Thank heaven.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.851
Oh...

46:11.880 --> 46:14.167
What's that?
Funny. Ah!

46:16.720 --> 46:17.926
Hmm?

46:18.360 --> 46:19.725
Oh...

46:19.880 --> 46:20.961
Mmm?

46:22.920 --> 46:24.285
Ah...

46:25.240 --> 46:26.287
Oh!

46:27.200 --> 46:30.170
Right. I demand some explanations.

46:30.720 --> 46:33.929
No, no. Change that.
I need a restorative.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.320
How 'bout some finger sandwiches?

46:35.720 --> 46:38.564
Just the usual, you know.
Egg cress, prawn mayonnaise,

46:39.160 --> 46:42.004
possibly a gallon of your finest whiskey

46:42.080 --> 46:43.320
just to start the day properly.

46:43.360 --> 46:45.044
You know how it is, gentlemen.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.761
Oh, I see.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.240
Actually, make that caviar.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.447
Some warmed blinis, creme fraiche,

46:56.520 --> 46:57.646
boiled egg whites,

46:58.000 --> 47:01.322
and vodka so ice cold
you need gloves to handle it.

47:01.720 --> 47:04.644
Oh! Oh! And don't forget
the herringbone spoon.

47:04.880 --> 47:06.803
We're not savages, after all, are we?

47:08.800 --> 47:09.847
Ooh!

47:10.000 --> 47:11.764
Welcome to Russia, Mr. Mortdecai.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.240
And you are?

47:14.760 --> 47:15.886
Roman Romanov.

47:16.080 --> 47:18.890
Romanov. Sir Graham's client.

47:19.320 --> 47:21.561
So I have him to thank for this.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.322
Oh, that's unpleasant. Mmm...

47:26.480 --> 47:27.641
Where's the Goya?

47:28.680 --> 47:30.808
- I don't know.
- But you know about art.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.007
A bit.

47:32.240 --> 47:33.571
You have a Turner of the Loire,

47:33.640 --> 47:34.766
which cannot be right

47:34.840 --> 47:36.680
because the original
is hanging in the D'Orsay.

47:36.720 --> 47:37.767
Terribly sorry.

47:38.240 --> 47:41.005
A magnificent Callow of about 1840,

47:41.800 --> 47:44.087
a polychrome James Bourne, rare,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.241
a pair of rather flashy Varleys

47:47.320 --> 47:48.446
from his last period,

47:49.040 --> 47:51.691
and the finest Edridge I have ever seen.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.051
Yes. Where is the Goya?

47:55.520 --> 47:57.841
Well, where is the last place you saw it?

47:57.920 --> 47:59.240
Have you looked under your couch?

47:59.400 --> 48:00.765
Yeah, because when I've lost something,

48:00.840 --> 48:03.446
sometimes I say to myself,
"Charlie, where could it be?"

48:04.080 --> 48:08.483
Oh, God! That wasn't nice!

48:09.360 --> 48:11.283
Oh, no! No.

48:11.560 --> 48:12.891
For 17 years,

48:12.960 --> 48:14.644
I pursued this painting.
You know why?

48:14.840 --> 48:17.127
Because I want, I will have.

48:19.680 --> 48:22.411
This will be easier and much less painful

48:22.480 --> 48:23.720
if you please to tell me.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.721
Where is the painting?

48:26.240 --> 48:27.760
But why does everyone seem to think...

48:31.360 --> 48:33.169
Oh! You pretended to be gentle,

48:33.240 --> 48:35.129
but you weren't! Oh!

48:35.440 --> 48:37.841
Milton Krampf tells everyone
he is getting painting.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.849
You're his dealer, so you have painting!

48:40.440 --> 48:42.966
I am very sorry.
I simply don't know.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.322
Dmitri, please to fetch 12-volt

48:45.440 --> 48:47.169
high-tension car battery.

48:48.720 --> 48:51.644
I am afraid you are
barking up the wrong Englishman, comrade.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.571
Vladimir, please to take
Mr. Mortdecai's trousers down.

48:57.880 --> 48:59.240
Perhaps we can work something out.

48:59.760 --> 49:03.765
What if I find it for you?
Say, 30% finder's fee, what?

49:04.320 --> 49:05.651
Open your balls.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.129
I shan't!
What does that even mean?

49:14.800 --> 49:15.881
I'll go to 20%.

49:17.520 --> 49:18.601
Balls.

49:19.880 --> 49:21.689
10% seems exploitive!

49:21.760 --> 49:22.886
Oh! Oh!

49:24.560 --> 49:26.085
That's not cricket!

49:31.120 --> 49:32.201
Oh, Jock...

49:36.840 --> 49:38.046
Jump!

49:38.280 --> 49:40.282
Oh, dear, sweet, resourceful Jock.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.051
It's my manservant.

49:43.120 --> 49:44.167
It appears he's requesting

49:44.240 --> 49:45.765
my immediate self-defenestration.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.367
Balls!

49:54.120 --> 49:55.246
Forgive me, Vladimir.

49:59.680 --> 50:00.681
No balls.

50:05.640 --> 50:07.085
Thank you so much, Vladimir.

50:08.520 --> 50:09.851
Oh, I see...

50:11.800 --> 50:14.770
Hello! I'm outside.

50:14.840 --> 50:15.841
Come on, sir.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.843
I wish to use your telephone!

50:17.920 --> 50:18.921
Head toward the bike.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.844
Oh, I love motorcycles.
They're very fast.

50:21.920 --> 50:23.649
- Sir? Sir?
- Mmm? What, Jock?

50:23.840 --> 50:25.001
Your trousers.

50:25.080 --> 50:26.241
- It's a little unseemly.
- The trousers...

50:26.440 --> 50:28.488
Jock, you know, it's entirely possible

50:28.560 --> 50:29.721
that I've bumped my head...

50:29.800 --> 50:30.801
You think?

50:30.920 --> 50:34.129
Have you heard
the expression, "Open your balls"?

50:34.240 --> 50:35.321
No, sir.

50:35.400 --> 50:37.004
It made me feel dirty.

50:43.320 --> 50:44.526
Hang on, sir!

50:52.720 --> 50:53.926
Bloody good show, Jock!

50:55.000 --> 50:56.445
You really are a cut above!

50:58.320 --> 50:59.924
Where would you like to go, sir?

51:00.160 --> 51:02.766
The only safe ground is English soil.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.330
To the Embassy, chop-chop.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.324
- Oh!
- Jock?

51:09.080 --> 51:10.320
Keep your head down, sir!

51:13.760 --> 51:15.080
- Hang on, sir!
- Okay!

51:16.200 --> 51:17.201
- Jock?
- Yes, sir?

51:17.480 --> 51:19.244
Will it be all right in the end?

51:19.440 --> 51:20.521
I couldn't say, sir!

51:29.800 --> 51:31.040
No, not the stairs!

51:34.760 --> 51:35.761
Oh!

51:38.040 --> 51:39.530
A bit of noise, sir!

51:40.560 --> 51:42.040
- Ahh!
- There we go!

51:42.640 --> 51:43.721
Ahh.

51:55.840 --> 51:57.808
Oh, it was dashed exhilarating.

51:57.960 --> 51:59.724
Where to, sir?

51:59.840 --> 52:01.842
Well, it was long ago,
and she was underage,

52:01.920 --> 52:03.763
but I do believe the embassy is that way.

52:03.960 --> 52:05.450
- Right you are, sir.
- Right.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.130
- Jockie?
- Yes, sir?

52:08.560 --> 52:09.800
"Open your balls"?

52:10.000 --> 52:11.047
I have no idea.

52:11.240 --> 52:14.483
Is it that you actually know
and don't want to tell me?

52:15.120 --> 52:16.201
Yes, sir.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.687
- Yes?
- They've got him.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.330
Ambassador's residence in Moscow.

52:21.400 --> 52:22.731
They're putting him on
the next flight to Heathrow.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.801
Thank you.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.962
Oh, and his wife is on
line six for you, sir.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.201
Thank you!

52:29.360 --> 52:30.361
Thank you, Maurice.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.161
Maurice?

52:34.240 --> 52:35.401
Shut the door.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.206
Yes, sir.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.560
Hello, Johanna.
We've found him.

52:41.600 --> 52:42.806
He's on his way home.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.809
Thank heavens.

52:44.880 --> 52:47.451
This place is an absolute
mausoleum on one's own.

52:47.720 --> 52:48.801
Do you feel unsafe?

52:48.880 --> 52:50.006
<i>A bit.</i>

52:50.160 --> 52:52.083
I could park outside for the night.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.563
Oh, I couldn't ask.
But how about tomorrow?

52:55.760 --> 52:58.127
Do come in, of course. Say, 8:00?

52:58.560 --> 53:00.801
You, me, and Charlie?

53:01.000 --> 53:02.286
Well, of course, Alastair.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.601
Wouldn't do, the two of us
here alone, would it?

53:05.960 --> 53:07.121
No, I suppose not.

53:07.760 --> 53:11.560
Still, if he can't make it,
he can't make it.

53:12.240 --> 53:13.321
<i>May I bring anything?</i>

53:13.880 --> 53:15.600
Perhaps there is something you could bring.

53:15.840 --> 53:17.126
A bottle of Chardonnay?

53:17.320 --> 53:18.845
A complete regimental listing of

53:18.920 --> 53:21.924
the British 7th Army,
2nd Division, June of 1945.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.000
Very well, Johanna.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.684
<i>'Til tomorrow. Ta!</i>

53:30.440 --> 53:33.011
Well, maybe he won't be able to make it.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.686
Uppy. uppy, Jock!

53:49.880 --> 53:50.961
You are uppy, sir.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.889
Am I? Where are we?

53:54.360 --> 53:56.328
You should see the other fellow.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.882
The fact that you're as drunk
as a fiddler's bitch

54:00.960 --> 54:02.246
in no way obviates the fact

54:02.440 --> 54:04.966
that you very nearly caused
an international incident.

54:05.640 --> 54:07.768
A man your age has no excuse

54:07.840 --> 54:09.490
for looking or behaving like

54:09.720 --> 54:10.801
a fugitive from a home

54:10.880 --> 54:13.406
for alcoholic music hall artistes.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.886
I will have you know that
I am not an alcoholic.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.411
I am a drunk,

54:18.480 --> 54:20.050
and there is a vast difference.

54:20.680 --> 54:21.841
In my defense,

54:21.920 --> 54:23.888
I was not drinking until the plane.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.242
- And in the car, sir.
- And a bit in the car.

54:26.440 --> 54:27.771
And the Ambassador's residence.

54:27.960 --> 54:31.123
Ah!
And at the Ambassador's residence.

54:31.480 --> 54:34.165
The only advice I offer is you do not apply

54:34.240 --> 54:35.924
to another of our embassies for help

54:36.160 --> 54:38.561
if and when you outrage the laws

54:38.640 --> 54:40.563
of the United States, once you are there.

54:40.760 --> 54:42.569
Stop! Stop!

54:43.280 --> 54:46.011
Are you suggesting that
I go to the Colonies?

54:46.480 --> 54:49.211
Perish the vile thought.
I couldn't possibly.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.528
The sale of your Rolls-Royce to Krampf

54:51.640 --> 54:53.324
will offer you a perfect cover.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.409
Find out if he's got that painting.

54:55.840 --> 54:57.251
Get behind the gates of his estate

54:57.320 --> 54:58.526
and poke around a bit.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.610
The car has been loaded upon

55:00.680 --> 55:02.444
a cargo flight to Los Angeles,

55:02.640 --> 55:04.051
and is halfway across the Atlantic.

55:04.120 --> 55:05.963
You will follow.

55:06.160 --> 55:08.527
California? Oh, icky!

55:08.880 --> 55:10.530
Your bags have been packed and checked,

55:10.600 --> 55:12.887
and your flight leaves... Ah, now.

55:13.120 --> 55:14.485
On your feet, soldier.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.681
Hang on to me.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.648
I should like to ring my wife because

55:21.720 --> 55:23.722
she's probably quite worried about me.

55:23.960 --> 55:25.724
Oh, don't worry about her.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.251
I've been keeping her filled in.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.488
I say, old bean!

55:32.720 --> 55:34.484
Go to America and see Krampf.

55:34.920 --> 55:36.524
Do what it takes to bring
the painting back,

55:36.600 --> 55:39.126
and leave Johanna to me.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.722
Jock? Come here.

55:57.600 --> 56:00.444
I'm frightened.
Do you think that Johanna is

56:00.520 --> 56:02.120
thawing on the subject of the moustache?

56:02.440 --> 56:03.441
Uh...

56:08.200 --> 56:09.361
Hi.

56:09.440 --> 56:10.771
Hello.

56:13.440 --> 56:14.930
Sorry, there was a queue.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.724
Good God, man!

56:21.880 --> 56:22.961
Jockie!

56:23.240 --> 56:27.450
Focus, man!
There are but five days to insolvency.

56:27.640 --> 56:30.120
- Two, sir.
- No, today's, what, Monday?

56:30.560 --> 56:31.561
Thursday, sir.

56:31.640 --> 56:33.927
Ah, well done. Carry on.

57:06.240 --> 57:07.969
Oh...

57:08.360 --> 57:12.126
Ah, Jock. Dear, sweet, sperm-heavy Jock.

57:12.520 --> 57:15.205
Behold this America, this new colossus,

57:15.320 --> 57:17.209
this fair land of the free!

57:18.200 --> 57:20.601
What kind of hell-place is this?

57:21.040 --> 57:22.041
Ooh!

57:22.200 --> 57:24.282
I feel as though we've made a wrong turn

57:24.360 --> 57:26.488
and arrived on the set
of a pornographic film.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.603
Have we taken a wrong turn and arrived

57:28.680 --> 57:30.284
on the set of a pornographic film?

57:31.880 --> 57:32.881
Checking in?

57:33.520 --> 57:36.649
I am Mortdecai, Lord of Silverdale.

57:37.480 --> 57:39.289
I should like to request a bucket of ice,

57:39.360 --> 57:42.125
"Do Not Disturb" sign, and a bulldozer.

57:43.480 --> 57:45.528
- Checking in?
- Yeah, we're checking in.

57:46.800 --> 57:49.565
I suspect I may need to redecorate.

57:50.040 --> 57:52.008
Room 326, overlooks the pool.

57:52.960 --> 57:56.043
So all I must do is show up,

57:56.200 --> 57:57.680
and I'm presented with a credit card.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.087
No wonder your country's in financial ruin.

58:01.880 --> 58:03.245
Do you need help with your bags?

58:04.040 --> 58:06.008
No, I do not need help with my bags.

58:06.080 --> 58:07.525
I have a fucking manservant.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.486
Strange country.

58:14.920 --> 58:15.921
Ow!

58:21.720 --> 58:22.881
Hello.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.206
Hold it.

58:32.680 --> 58:33.761
Thanks.

58:36.560 --> 58:37.721
Hey.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.281
Hello...

58:48.280 --> 58:49.281
Ahh!

58:55.960 --> 58:58.611
It's like listening to bloody orangutans!

58:59.440 --> 59:01.886
Oh, really, why? Why?

59:08.480 --> 59:09.970
Hello, American?

59:10.480 --> 59:12.482
The rooms here are made of cement.

59:12.560 --> 59:14.210
Very good in case of an air raid.

59:14.320 --> 59:16.160
But for those of us
trying to get a bit of rest

59:16.200 --> 59:17.725
after an arduous crossing,

59:17.800 --> 59:19.484
a bit of an acoustic nightmare.

59:19.560 --> 59:22.325
So would you please stop
grunting like wildebeests

59:22.480 --> 59:25.324
and allow me to get some sleep, man?
Please! Please!

59:25.960 --> 59:28.440
<i>Sony, sir.
We'll try and keep it down.</i>

59:28.800 --> 59:31.804
Good God, Jock!
Put that thing away, man!

59:42.680 --> 59:43.681
Hello?

59:43.800 --> 59:47.964
Oh, apple of my eye.
The love of my life.

59:48.400 --> 59:51.244
Everything here makes me think of you.

59:51.480 --> 59:52.606
Who is this?

59:54.760 --> 59:57.286
It is I, your beloved.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.283
Your husband, Charlie.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.850
Where are you?

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.685
Oh, a terribly vulgar
place called Los Angeles.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.686
Apparently located in
the far West colonies.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.444
Well, what are you doing there?

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.602
Well, I'm delivering
the Rolls to that grotesque

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.205
Milton Krampf

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.284
and retrieving a certain
something in the process.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.885
Stay away from Krampf's daughter.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.889
She's a well-known nymphomaniac.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.367
Is she?

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.044
<i>How do you know such things?</i>

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.531
Johanna, we seem to be out of ice.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.806
Should I send for some?

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.041
It's my husband on the line.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.971
<i>Oh, is he Still alive?</i>

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.644
<i>Has he got the painting yet?</i>

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.801
Is that Martland?

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.724
I'll just be a moment, Alastair.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.724
That Judas! That Ajax! That Paris!

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.046
Or was it Agamemnon?

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.207
Oh, you know who I mean.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.129
That ghastly chap who stole Helen of Troy

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.368
and started all that nasty
business in Greece.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.925
Done!

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Finally!

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.890
Charlie?
Why are people achieving climax

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.690
in your immediate vicinity?

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.162
Well, I think
I'm staying in some

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.686
sort of cement brothel, my love.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.561
Say that again.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.768
You look here, I will have you know that

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.087
I too am capable of being desirable

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.850
to a certain type of woman!

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.001
Charlie!

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.320
<i>Yes, oh, yes!</i>

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.006
Some women go blind batting their lashes

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.367
for mustachioed men such as I!

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.082
Charlie Mortdecai, you are
on very dangerous ground!

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.601
Tell me the name of that
nympho daughter of Krampf's!

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.445
Perhaps she would render
an opinion on the issue! Hmm?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.122
Never mind.
I've found a cold Latour

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.406
which we might enjoy...

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.366
Johanna?

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.121
Oh, balls.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.362
<i>Jock and I
set off to deliver the Rolls</i>

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.250
<i>to my client, Milton Krampf,</i>

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.451
<i>ruthless billionaire, art collector,</i>

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.122
<i>and the rumored possessor of the lost Goya.</i>

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.122
<i>I was hot on the scent,</i>

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.206
<i>and a teensy bit curious
about his nympho daughter.</i>

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.401
Ah. Oh. Ooh.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.090
Yes... Right.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.724
We must secure the painting,

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.643
escape this nightmare posthaste

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.649
and you should interrupt me
as soon as you can.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.886
- Yes, sir.
- Oh!

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.330
Lucky saddle.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.490
Ah!

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.241
Yes!

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.928
The fine life-giving drinks
tray manifests itself.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.331
A mint julep, sir.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.402
Anything will do, I thank you.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.681
I'm Georgina Krampf.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.850
Oh! How do you do?

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.446
You must be Mortdecai.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.208
Yes, indeed I am he.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.966
Are you not having
a little something to drink?

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.520
No, I never drink alcohol.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.690
I don't like to blunt my senses.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.371
How awful.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.171
Oh, I feel wonderful.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.046
- Ooh!
- Feel me.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.366
Hmm?

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.040
Feel? Oh.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.601
Oh, yes.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.802
No, not there, stupid. Here.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.041
Ah!

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.169
Ooh.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.367
Ooh...

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.044
Charlie Mortdecai, you son-of-a-bitch...

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.566
I was not squeezing the breasts...

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.201
The Rolls.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.841
Huh?

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.245
Oh.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.250
So, I was a mule!

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.486
Right. You know, Bronwen called me

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.681
when she discovered the Goya,

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.331
and I called Spinoza,
and then he arranged for everything,

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.449
including the smuggling
of the painting in your Rolls.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.522
Yes, but someone found out about the plan,

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.922
and now Bronwen is as stiff
as my Uncle Richard's hatband.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.170
Art restoring is a nasty business.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.691
You are a nasty business, sir.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.001
Just look at her.
Isn't she a beauty?

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.764
- Yes, she is.
- My God...

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.851
- She's exquisite.
- So good...

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.687
The expert brushstrokes,
the smooth lines...

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.841
Doesn't she look like my mother?

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.000
Can you see a resemblance?

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.125
I never met your mother.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.124
No, not in her, in me.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.526
She's got prominent lips like me...

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.726
Ah!

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.245
...and those far-searching eyes...

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.961
- Don't you think so?
- Mmm. Mmm. Oh, yes.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.081
Do you mind?

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.641
Mmm.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.645
I was just looking for something... else.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.041
Mmm.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.561
Okay. Um...

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.804
Uh, Branspath? Okay.
Thank you so much.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.882
- In my study, please.
- Very good, sir.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.644
Thank you.
No hard feelings.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.804
I hope you'll stay with me tonight.
I'm throwing a party.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.649
I'm gonna unveil the Duchess,

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.406
and watch every art world snob
in town drool all over her.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.003
We'll have your things
sent over from the hotel.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.287
Go upstairs and freshen up.
You smell like a horse!

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.880
And if you're quick about it,

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.321
you might have time
to couple with Georgina before dinner.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.002
She's been through half the staff already.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.443
Sir, you're staring at your liquor.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.920
So I am.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.846
Jock, I fear we are in
the eleventh hour, man.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.761
Our very future rests on

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.207
getting our hands on that blasted painting.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:47.046
And therefore it's imperative
that we devise a plan.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.771
And it will have to be a
fiendishly clever plan.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.041
Well, sir... I've been thinking...

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.288
And I mean dizzyingly complex,

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.522
replete with feints and distractions

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.207
and calibrated movements
of the Swiss watch type. What?

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.846
Thoughts?

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.891
During the party,
we steal it while no one's looking.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.128
Ingenious. Once again?

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.886
You go down, get your face seen a bit...

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.961
Mmm.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.485
Then you meet me 'round the back later,

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.641
we climb up the side

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.530
of the building,
break through the window, grab the painting.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.409
Oh, diabolical.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.360
Let's review it
a few more times, shall we?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.082
It's just the old
smash-and-grab routine, sir.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.400
Of course it is.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.563
This is just the old
smash-and-grab business.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.045
Smash-and-grab.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.209
- Jock?
- Yes, sir?

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.890
I am so very proud of you.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.081
Thank you, sir.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.200
- And, Jock?
- Yes, sir?

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.685
You know, I've always
been rather fond of you.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.761
Thank you, sir.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.921
- Jock?
- Yup?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.525
Will it be all right in the end?

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.364
How the fuck should I know?

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.085
Unremarkable.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.726
Keep the Englishman busy.
I create distraction.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.211
No problem.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.801
Ooh!

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.401
Hi.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.807
Oh!

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.280
That's my bottom.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.891
Dance with me.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.245
Starburst!

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.764
Oh! So much!
So much to look at!

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.007
Hmm.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.641
Have me.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.407
Oh, my dear, I'm so tired.
And so married and so tired.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.164
And so married... Oh!

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.170
And I'm married and tired, you know.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.121
I... Just...

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.321
Whoa!

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.160
Oh!

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.527
Darling!

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.921
Whatever brings you here?

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:22.529
This is not a breast in my hand!

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.362
I was unhappy with our last conversation,

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:27.687
so I got on the next plane. Surprised?

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.841
Oh, pleasantly.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.160
Aren't you going to introduce us?

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.886
Johanna, my dear, this is
Milton Krampf's nymph...

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.001
Daughter Georgina.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.962
And she was, well, we were having

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.725
a discussion about three...

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.361
Sometimes, you know, how it's like a...

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.680
Whew! Uh...

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.361
My, my, look at the time! Uh...

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.041
Carry on!

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.886
Oh! Oh!

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.243
A beast... A beast...

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.410
Ooh. Oh.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:22.724
Yes, yes, yes.
Good hungry doggie...

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.089
Weenie, weenie, weenie, weenie, weenie...

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:29.243
Weenie, weenie, weenie, weenie, weenie...

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.680
I met a beast...

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:42.691
Krampf's window is
the second one on the left.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.363
No, no. I met a beast!

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:45.770
Get on that ladder!

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.843
And what, pray tell, might you be doing

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.524
whilst I'm engaged in thus heroics?

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.131
Oh! Beast! Beast! Beast...

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.046
Oh, how I long for the rain
and indifference of Europe.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.201
Well done, Jock!

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.131
It's a privilege, sir!

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.201
Ah...

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.046
Well then, Mr. Krampf.
I suppose since you're here

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.329
and I'm here,
it's time for you and I to talk turkey.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.607
Oh, I see.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.331
Oh, I see.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.005
Bad news for you, Strago.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.483
There are no bank codes on that painting.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.764
I think we both know that there are.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.001
Invisible ink, no?

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.286
Stop right there!

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.646
Sit down. Sit!

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.090
I... I warn you, Georgina.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.844
You have no idea what
you're getting involved with.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.844
Despite his man purse,
Strago is very dangerous.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.969
Darling, they are in cahoots.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.167
How do you know?

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.365
Oh, that's gross!

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.921
We are in love.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.806
Drop the gun!

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.681
Emil!

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.485
- Alastair!
- Do it now!

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.520
Good show, Martland!

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.290
Bit redundant, really, as he's dead.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.723
Alastair, what are you doing here?

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.120
I followed you.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.281
Wouldn't do to have you walking into

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.369
all this mess on your own, now, would it?

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.846
Jock, give me the painting.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.209
- Sit down!
- Drop the knife!

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.281
I will shoot you.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.209
Yes, most likely by accident.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.130
None of you will ever know
what it's like to make love

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.361
to a man with principles.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.481
Well, in my case,

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.971
I can safely say you are correct.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.169
However, I never went
to Eton where buggery is rampant.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.000
Oh, you were at Eton,
weren't you, Martland?

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.320
Yes, yes, I was.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.880
Yes, I was!

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.760
Please don't be sick!
Please don't be sick!

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.326
It's the shellfish!

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.720
- You have it?
- Go!

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.761
- Do you have it?
- Go!

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.564
I go, I go, I go!

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.086
Valet!

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.445
Oh, I don't like that.
I don't like it.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.686
- Close your eyes, sir.
- Right.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.842
Give me the keys.
Keys to the Rolls.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.161
Come on, let's go.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.089
Well, at least none of
us had the shellfish.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.571
Jock, please!

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.969
My sympathetic gag reflex.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.282
Have you lost your bearings, man?

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.204
Shellfish at a catered affair?

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.210
And I will have you two know that

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.647
I had a firm grasp on things
before you showed up.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.967
Oh! You certainly had
a firm grasp on something!

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.209
You dare to cast aspersions?

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.567
I am not the one entertaining at all hours

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.440
with a failed poet! Oh!

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.641
At least my focus at
university wasn't plagiarism!

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.760
Oh, stay out of it!

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.920
Oh, I've got a sensitive tummy!

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.849
There's more, there's more, there's more...

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.320
No more, no more, no more.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.481
I swallowed it.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.921
At least I have
the good taste to hide my indiscretions

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.843
and not parade them under everyone's nose!

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.604
So you admit there were indiscretions?

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.841
I admit nothing!

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.921
Then I deny nothing.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.001
Oh, shut up!

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.926
Questionable attack, Jock.
Spirited, though.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.001
I'm done.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.000
There's their car!

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.644
- Where?
- There!

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.682
Now we wait. Thirty seconds.
Twenty-nine... Twenty-eight...

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.921
Don't count.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.569
Better out than in. All right...

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.888
I shall secure the perimeter.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.686
Why, this is an outrage!
There's not an ocean vista

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.160
within miles of this establishment.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.770
Please don't be tiresome. Jock!

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.083
Are you quite finished
with your barrage of insults?

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.809
Now we heat the surface,

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.048
reveal the codes and transfer the money.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.886
Get the blowtorch.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.924
Nobody make a move.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.206
I really wouldn't, you know,

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.011
he's trained and sexually frustrated.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.690
Those bank codes won't fall into

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.404
the wrong hands again.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.891
Back away from the painting.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.560
- Oh, don't do that!
- For heaven's sake.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.641
For England!

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.325
Oh, dear.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.606
- Everyone out!
- Okay.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.044
<i>The local
authorities were displeased.</i>

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.884
<i>Strago and Georgina fled,</i>

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.280
<i>leaving the rest of us to answer</i>

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:30.005
<i>some rather pointed questions.</i>

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.329
<i>I recounted the sordid
tale as best I could...</i>

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.530
This may be a customary
greeting in America.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.641
I don't know.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.841
<i>All the while,
my thoughts were only of home.</i>

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.886
<i>If indeed Johanna and I
still had a home to go to.</i>

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.204
I'm not sure if Jock has
mentioned it, but I am

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.011
very, very sorry about everything.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.171
Darling? Please?

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:15.323
I suppose that
we will have to open the house to tours.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.449
I'll have Jock fix up
the servants quarters for us.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.369
Do you think that Jockie will stay on

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.046
without pay or lodging?

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.281
Don't be daft.
This isn't finished yet.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.563
That painting was a fake.

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.570
A fake? How do you know?

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.284
A chap called Bunny's

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.480
- got the real one.
- Bunny?

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.085
Bronwen lied from the start.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.286
She never found the lost Goya.
She painted it.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.201
Of course!

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.126
<i>Bronwen makes a fake, and calls Krampf.</i>

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.122
Am I interested?
I'm wildly interested.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.283
<i>Krampf calls Spinoza.</i>

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.444
<i>Georgina finds out about it
and tells Emil, who goes to</i>

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.443
<i>steal the painting from Bronwen.</i>

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.085
<i>But Spinoza's already there.</i>

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.969
<i>He boffs Emil on the bean</i>

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.560
<i>and takes the painting.</i>

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.923
<i>Spinoza then secrets
the painting into the Rolls</i>

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.642
<i>and I unwittingly smuggle it to Krampf.</i>

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.327
The Duke told me
that Bunny has the painting,

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.521
but I can't find him.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.681
Which Duke?

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.127
Of Asherboroughdon.
Bronwen's lover.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.121
Bunny.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.689
"Love, your Bunny!"
Oh! The note in the studio.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.087
It was not from a child, it was from him.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:26.685
<i>The Duke is Bunny.</i>

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.289
And it wasn't his tadger.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.687
Come again?

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.207
The Duke kept trying
to get me to go into his lavatory

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.964
to look at his John Thomas.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.281
Oh. Randy bugger.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.965
Only that wasn't it at all!

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.800
He was trying to show me the real painting.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.640
<i>The Duchess of Wellington
is in Bunny's loo.</i>

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.807
Oh! Ooh!

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.525
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.446
Oh, my.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.721
Oh, my!

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.330
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.044
Well, the water bailiff
won't bother him now.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.207
Mmm.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.369
Terribly sorry for your loss, madam.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.166
How very kind.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.520
Would you mind ever so much
if we used the lavatory?

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:30.841
It's this way.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.324
Oh, you beautiful breadwinner.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.164
Mwah.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.323
Darling, please, you are killing me.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.640
Right.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.081
Out the window with it?

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.046
Quite.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.567
However...

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.728
I do have the slightest of queries.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.201
What do we do next?

01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.881
Hmm.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.081
Because if Martland should get

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.201
his grubby hands on that painting,

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.402
he would destroy a magnificent work of art.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.921
And we will be out a finder's fee.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.929
If it falls into Strago's hands,

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.520
he will unleash his unpleasantness

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.568
to disastrous effect upon the world.

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.168
And if we try to sell it to Romanov,

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.561
he will kill us and simply take it instead.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.489
And yet we must find a way to pay

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.528
eight million in back taxes.

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.560
Mmm. Quite, quite, yes, indeed, quite.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.405
Quite a conundrum, this.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.807
I shall need a moment
to think this through, I'm afraid.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.042
Yes, do. Do think.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.929
Just bear in mind, I'm standing on a loo,

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.405
holding a dead man's Goya.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.087
Our painting is entered
in Sedgwick's Friday auction,

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.247
is it not?

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.767
Yes.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.406
Perfect.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.201
We are going to
enter the Goya into the auction,

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.765
disguised as our Sheridan.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.725
But it's already at Sedgwick's.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.245
It's been authenticated.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.811
We'll make a switch.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.125
But first we must convince our buyers

01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.651
that the Goya's back in play.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.649
They won't take our word for it.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.250
They'll want to see it themselves.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.930
Then we'll show it to them.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.762
<i>What the situation requires now</i>

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.321
<i>is a well-spun rumor.</i>

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.568
Sir Graham. A message for you, sir.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.447
What is all this nonsense?

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.089
You know I'm not interested
in your flaccid Sheridan.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.171
Darling?

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.167
Interested now?

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.481
Very.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.568
But I watched it burn.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.085
It's Mortdecai, sir.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.009
Chatter is he's found a dashedly clever way

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.764
to move it on the open market.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.130
The auction starts at 5:00 p.m.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.964
I want that painting.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.126
The auction got it.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.006
Good luck!

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.364
I believe he still owes me a finger.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.363
- Hello, pookie.
- Hello, darling.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.005
I nicked one of their passkeys.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.400
Well done.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.646
We're Lot Seven.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.563
I shall need 30 seconds to make the switch

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.170
once it's announced. Do not delay.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.080
I know this building like
the back of my hand.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.208
- You will have your time.
- Oh. Mmm.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.526
Good luck.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.644
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.881
Welcome to Sedgwick's

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:56.887
Autumn Master's Sale.
We shall begin with Lot One.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.407
<i>Barnyard Friends.</i>
A lovely Helen Allingham,

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.571
depicting two horses,
an ass, and several cocks.

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.729
There's a lovely sky here.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.083
Shall we start the bidding
at 17,000 pounds?

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.681
Seventeen thousand pounds,
thank you very much.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.920
Stealthy, man, stealthy.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.526
Oh.

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.404
Like a jungle cat.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.601
Oh! Ahh!

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.960
Hello, Vladimir.
So good to see you out and about.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.120
Tell us where painting is,

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.850
or you have big hole in your head.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.763
You will have hole in your balls!

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.401
Why is Dmitri obsessed with testicula?

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.444
Your mother and father only met once.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.085
And money changed hands.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.564
Probably less than a 20.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.764
And they say she was dressed
as a man at the time.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.285
I wouldn't, mate.
I really wouldn't.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.010
Sold to the gentleman in the fuchsia ascot.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.163
Moving on to Lot Two.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.680
All right. There.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.928
You won't be needing this anymore, will you?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.001
Will you? Huh?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.081
- Ahh!
- Ooh!

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.166
My God.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.001
Oh, dash it all, Jock, man, your hand!

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.970
It's all right, sir, I've got another.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.241
You know, remarkably,

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.731
this is not the first time I've shot Jock.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.801
Sir, the switch.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.445
- Mmm?
- The switch, sir.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.601
Oh, quite right.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.330
No time to dally. Ugh.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.124
I'll meet you inside, sir.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.121
And we move on to Lot Four.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.483
Fernand Just Quignon's <i>Lavender Field.</i>

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.001
Isn't it charming?

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.724
Thirty-five thousand pounds.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.926
Forty thousand pounds? 40,000?
45, isn't it?

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.567
Forty-five, thank you, sir.
45, 50, back on the...

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.841
Give me the painting.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.041
What painting?

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.841
Oh!

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.126
I see that you have been schooled

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.561
in the fine art of fencing.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.447
Alas,

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.046
so have I.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:09.091
An essential part of
every gentleman's education.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.291
And as a gentleman, I should warn you

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.201
that my coup d'arret is
still whispered about

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.647
in hushed tones to this very day.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.040
Ooh!

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.001
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it!

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.081
Oh, Oh, Oh!

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.727
Twenty-five thousand pounds.

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.568
Lot Five.
<i>Smiling Woman in a Chair.</i>

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.522
Sold for 210,000 pounds.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.321
<i>And now, moving on to Lot Six.</i>

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.921
Ha-ha!

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.321
Oh.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.167
Ha-ha!

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.646
Oh!

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:33.887
Oh, dear.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.088
I would like to humbly

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.810
and unreservedly offer my deepest...

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.527
Truce?

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.406
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.045
if you would please remain calm.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.131
Ladies and gentlemen, if you would please

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.202
remain in your seats, I would be grateful.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.561
Ah!

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.361
Where is Mortdecai?

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.565
Well, come on, then.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.246
God.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:02.688
Going on to Lot Seven.
<i>Colonel Blucher</i>

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.445
<i>- with Hounds near Twineham.</i>
- But quietly. Quietly.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.042
A lovely Sheridan offered
by the Mortdecai estate.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.608
Shall we start the bidding
at 100,000 pounds?

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.922
One hundred thousand pounds.
Thank you, Sir Graham.

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.603
Fang wants finger.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.241
Must go and bid.
Must go and bid. Must go and bid.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:27.960
Where is Mortdecai?

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.606
Tell me.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.964
He's not here, mate. He sent me.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.321
Where is he?

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.442
It's just me, mate.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.485
Oh, God!

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.522
Dear, sweet, heroic Jock.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.642
Two hundred. Very good. Do we have three?

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.801
Three.

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.323
Yes, well, in future,
if you could please use your paddles.

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:53.490
I will take your finger.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.124
I couldn't help overhearing

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.522
some discussion about your finger.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.685
Oh, don't worry about that,
sir, I've got nine more.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.881
I feel simply awful, man,
but I must get to the auction.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.685
I'll be all right, sir.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.530
We need eight million.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.040
Now, can we go to 500?

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.246
500, ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.450
There he is.
Now don't cause a panic.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.726
Just get him.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:39.966
Five hundred thousand.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.082
Five hundred thousand.

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.201
Hold. Hold.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.402
Thank you, madam, 500,000.

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:48.444
Do I have 600?
600,000 pounds, ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.443
- Bid.
- Oh! What?

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.921
A bid from Lady Mortdecai, who seems to be

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.451
bidding on her own painting.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.320
Just taking the horse for
a trot out to London

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.486
and back, are we?

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.047
- Oh! Yeah.
- Very well. 600 then.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.243
I'll make it up to you, Jockie.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.601
Oh, I know you will, sir. You always do.

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.530
Well done, sir.

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:36.883
It is a privilege, Jock.

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.646
<i>Are we all done at 900,000?</i>

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.884
- Go bid!
- Oh!

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:47.001
<i>Fair warning at 900,000 pounds</i>

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.445
from Sir Graham.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.607
Last chance. And we are...

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.926
Darling.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.570
Yes, Lord Mortdecai?

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.922
Would you also like to make a bid?

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.281
Ten million pounds.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:07.603
Ten million pounds
from Lord Mortdecai himself.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:11.761
Move!

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.571
- Come on!
- Twenty million, you swine!

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.606
Twenty-five million.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.969
Twenty-five and a half!
26 and a quarter!

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.240
Thirty million. Final offer!

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:22.924
Is that our final bid?

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.960
Are we all done at 30 million pounds?

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:29.327
Sold.

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.803
There you are. 2,642 pounds.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.251
I do beg your pardon.

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:43.244
Uh, maths were never my strong suit.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.927
But there was mention of 30 million,

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.161
so you take that.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.011
Uh, less commission, carrying,

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.730
handling, and transfer taxes,

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.840
left a total of just over
eight million pounds.

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.926
Which I am sorry to report has been...

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.604
Garnished by Her Majesty's government

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.968
in settlement of your tax bill, Charlie.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.081
Can you think of a good reason

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.969
why I shouldn't arrest you right now?

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.851
I eschew discomfort?

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.963
Any blame here should fall on me.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.451
Dear Alastair,

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:17.368
if I led you to believe
there was anything between us,

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.283
it was merely to find out about the case

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.124
and protect my husband.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.890
Can you forgive me?

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.200
Of course, Johanna.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.166
- Charlie?
- Mmm.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.522
It was a damned good try, old bean.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.728
"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.244
"the saddest are these,
'It might have been'."

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.090
Thank you, Maurice.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.086
<i>Poor Jock.
He was frantic with worry.</i>

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.562
<i>But I knew everything
would be all right in the end.</i>

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.684
Magnificent.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:15.004
Do you think the codes are really there?

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.603
They most certainly are, darling.

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.001
And I gave them to the authorities.

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.287
Anonymously, of course.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.561
We may be flat broke, my darling,

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:27.842
but we are not desperate.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.203
I do hope Romanov doesn't come down

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.805
too hard on Sir Graham,

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:34.565
when he finds out he bought the wrong fake.

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.691
Lights.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.289
That is disappointing.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.331
Very disappointing.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.490
Open your balls.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.481
Bollocks.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:01.641
Now, tell me about that tramp on the horse.

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.481
Oh, my darling,

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.564
I tried desperately to
be unfaithful to you,

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.125
I really did.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.844
But I just couldn't do it.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.081
It's a terrible moment
when you find yourself

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.845
falling in love with your
own spouse, isn't it?

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:22.126
Now, that is the look that softens

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.202
every bone in my body,

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.126
except one.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:31.005
Do you mean you are ready?

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.728
I see no obstacle to such a course.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.005
My love, surely you recall

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.686
I have already been circumcised.

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.524
Mmm...

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.285
Charlie?

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.169
Mrs. Mortdecai, as you well know,

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.611
I am a man of few words.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.643
I deeply, deeply love

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.085
my moustache.

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.561
But

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:10.971
I have discovered

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.925
that I love you

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.727
more.

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.007
Proceed.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:26.642
Would you really do that for me?

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:33.007
For you, there is nothing I would not do.

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.321
Well, in that case, Mr. Mortdecai,

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:44.161
I should be very pleased
if you would keep it.

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.246
Really?

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.730
I mean...

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.121
Mmm...

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.966
Oh, darl...

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.691
Your gag reflex.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.171
Try me.

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.526
Pookie.

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.248
I have never been so...
