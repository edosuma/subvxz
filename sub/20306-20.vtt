NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.461 --> 00:05.380
I happen to be in love with Gina, Fay.

00:05.463 --> 00:07.716
Love? Is that what they're
calling it these days, Henry?

00:07.799 --> 00:09.801
The first of four Black families

00:09.884 --> 00:12.012
are moving into
the O'Neill Housing Project.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.180
What did you mean before,
saying that this Black family

00:14.264 --> 00:16.349
that just moved in here
was just buying trouble?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.685
Any father in his right mind
wouldn't move his family

00:18.768 --> 00:20.270
into this kind of situation.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.815
The baby hasn't breathed without a machine
since it was born.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.859
Isn't that great?

00:26.401 --> 00:27.360
Excuse me.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.447
We shoot some additional scenes
around the original material,

00:30.530 --> 00:33.533
reshape the concept
for a totally different audience.

00:33.616 --> 00:38.038
We need to have a clear idea
of what it is we're working with.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.664
I hate that man's position,

00:40.081 --> 00:42.292
but he deserves exactly
what you're depriving him of.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.586
Look, I don't need your lectures, okay?

00:44.669 --> 00:48.381
-We can't allow your 300 game.
-The hell you say.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.885
How about you and me going out
and getting a malted after work?

00:57.932 --> 00:58.767
HILL: Where were you?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.060
I'm sorry, pal.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.645
Well, sorry ain't good enough.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.278
Bobby Hill, you ride a desk
for the next three days.

01:11.154 --> 01:16.326
Andy, after your reports are in,
you'll ride with Rivera today

01:16.826 --> 01:18.078
and for the next couple.

01:18.328 --> 01:22.624
Uh, for those of you who haven't heard,
last night, at the O'Neill Projects,

01:22.957 --> 01:25.543
Officer Hill was forced
to fire upon a bad guy

01:25.627 --> 01:28.630
who was trying to open
Officer Hill's skull with a lead pipe.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.174
Today, thank God,

01:31.549 --> 01:35.762
Bobby's alive and the perp is dead,
instead of the other way around.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.598
Hey, nice work, Bobby! Good going, baby.

01:38.681 --> 01:43.478
And-- and if anybody tells you
it does not happen the other way around,

01:43.561 --> 01:47.732
you just give them a look-see
at page three of today's paper--

01:48.149 --> 01:51.611
all about the funeral
for Officer Ray Augustine

01:51.694 --> 01:52.987
from the South Ferry.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.991
Lest we forget, there's a widow,
two kids, need our help.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.827
The jar's set up over by the stairs.

01:59.619 --> 02:00.578
Let's dig deep.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.707
Item 6-- O'Neill Project's ongoing.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.334
We're maintaining our presence there.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.670
Lieutenant Hunter is supervising.

02:08.753 --> 02:12.340
Uniforms and plainclothes personnel,
you check the duty roster.

02:12.715 --> 02:17.095
Item 7-- the trial of Alan Seibert
is starting up again today.

02:17.178 --> 02:20.390
He's the suspect in the takedown
of Starlight Jewelry

02:20.473 --> 02:23.226
and the two attempted homicides
that went with it.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.938
Um, Sergeant Bates, Officer Coffey,
you had the original collar,

02:27.313 --> 02:29.524
so you're assigned to A.D.A. Davenport.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.777
Her chief witness is, uh, Gerald Goff.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.405
He's coming in at, uh, 7:30 a.m.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.074
Uh, he's a vagrant bum,

02:39.075 --> 02:42.787
so funds have been authorized
so you can spiff him up,

02:43.329 --> 02:45.623
try to make him presentable for a court.

02:45.707 --> 02:46.916
Have you guys had your rabies shots?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.251
(chortling)

02:50.378 --> 02:51.588
Item last--

02:52.714 --> 02:55.508
under the heading of poetic justice,

02:56.176 --> 03:00.889
last night or sometime this a.m.,
at the Bowlmore Lanes,

03:02.182 --> 03:03.183
there was a fire.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.809
(laughing)

03:04.893 --> 03:06.436
Possible arson.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.438
How'd you burn your eyebrows, Sarge?

03:08.521 --> 03:10.732
-You got a match?
-(jeering)

03:11.316 --> 03:14.152
I-I only mention this so that you'll know

03:14.235 --> 03:16.821
that the bowling league's
gonna have to relocate.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.116
Now, wherever it is, it's probably
gonna be the Pits-Neck Lanes.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.368
Let's hope that the management there

03:22.452 --> 03:25.246
at least knows the rudiments
of lane maintenance.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.584
So that if Jabo,
or anybody else for that matter,

03:29.667 --> 03:32.337
happens to catch lightning
in a bottle again,

03:32.670 --> 03:34.923
this time, damn it,
it's gonna stay in that bottle.

03:35.006 --> 03:38.051
(cheering)

03:38.134 --> 03:39.093
JABLONSKI: Okay!

03:40.261 --> 03:41.763
Okay, let's roll.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.098
Let's... show some respect.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.519
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.480
MAN: Okay. All right, Sarge.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.193
Hey, Bobby, what's going on
with you and Renko?

03:55.777 --> 03:56.778
A few differences.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.073
This way, hair bag!

04:03.243 --> 04:04.202
-Morning.
-Hi.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.829
How about a return engagement
on the malted tonight?

04:06.913 --> 04:07.747
Hey, that sounds great.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.332
Let me call my mother,
see if she can babysit.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.875
Okay. I'll check back with you.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.086
Pretty small, Bobby Hill,
standing in the corner like that.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.213
-You trying to embarrass me?
-I wasn't trying to--

04:15.296 --> 04:16.923
You just don't want to sit with me, right?

04:17.006 --> 04:18.758
-That's right.
-We got to talk.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.470
-There's nothing to talk about.
-We got everything to talk about, pal.

04:23.054 --> 04:23.888
Let's go.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.808
Hey, Sarge, you think it
was that extra oil on the lanes

04:26.891 --> 04:28.142
that caught fire or what?

04:28.226 --> 04:31.396
Hah, I would have loved to have seen
that old place burn down.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.315
Eighteen lanes--
it must have been quite a sight.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.694
I guess from now on,
they'll be calling the Bowlmore

04:37.777 --> 04:39.112
the "no more".

04:39.195 --> 04:41.030
Excuse me, Sergeant Jablonski?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.198
You got him.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.576
Talk to you a minute?
Arson squad, Fogerty.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.203
Damn it, Renko.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.788
-Friendship's got nothing to do with it.
-I'm sorry! I admit it.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.081
-I could have been killed.
-I don't know what else to say to you.

04:50.164 --> 04:53.126
-I was late. I admit it.
-You weren't late. You froze.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.086
Will you look at this?

04:55.461 --> 04:57.213
Now, I can't get this picture
out of my mind.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.173
This could have been my wife
and my child right here.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.510
Just because you got a family
don't make your life worth more than mine.

05:02.593 --> 05:06.139
I said it would never happen again!
I said I am sorry!

05:06.222 --> 05:07.348
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.892
Damn it! Just 'cause I screwed up once,

05:09.976 --> 05:12.061
that don't discount everything
I've ever done!

05:12.145 --> 05:13.354
Ain't you never gonna forgive me?

05:13.438 --> 05:16.024
Renko, I can get past
the anger, all right?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.527
But I can't get past the fact
that I'm scared to ride with you.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.784
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:27.285 --> 05:28.911
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:28.995 --> 05:32.832
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:32.915 --> 05:34.542
(sirens wailing)

05:40.006 --> 05:42.633
(theme music playing)

07:11.305 --> 07:14.767
Are you saying he didn't back you up,
or are you saying he was late?

07:15.309 --> 07:16.727
(sighs) He was late.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.897
If a cop doesn't back up his partner,
that's it, end of story.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.484
But this sounds like a question
of degree, a gray area.

07:24.026 --> 07:25.862
-He was a little late.
-Captain, no disrespect.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.238
You haven't been on the street in a while.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.949
There's no such thing as being
a little late in that situation.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.075
The problem I'm having here

07:31.159 --> 07:33.995
is that I've never heard anybody
question Renko's courage.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.830
I didn't either until lately.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.292
Okay, this isn't anything
we have to decide right this minute.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.752
You're gonna be on a desk for 72 hours.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.796
I want you to sit on it
for at least that long.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.842
All right, Captain, I'll sit on it,
but ain't nothing gonna hatch.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.136
I'll take a look at the reports.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.430
Um, Bobby,

07:53.055 --> 07:54.515
whatever else happens,

07:55.349 --> 07:56.517
it was good work last night.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.436
Thank you, sir.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.356
Would you cut it out already?

08:04.025 --> 08:07.236
For 10 minutes, all I've been hearing
is "did I burn a place".

08:07.320 --> 08:10.239
You're talking to a man
with 30 years' service.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.574
Do you think I'm this immature

08:11.657 --> 08:13.784
that I would torch a place
over a bowling score?

08:14.076 --> 08:16.496
Tommy Leland, the owner of the Bowlmore,
said you made threats.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.123
Oh, we're talking about
a different kind of threat.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.209
Economic sanctions, I said.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.128
I'd move the bowling league
somewhere else, that's all.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.506
Fire is one of your most
effective economic sanctions.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.924
Ah, that's nutso.

08:28.966 --> 08:33.429
Anyway, I was with Detective Belker
from this precinct all last night.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.514
Till what time?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.558
Eleven, maybe 10:45.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.020
-Then what'd you do?
-Nothing. I went home. I went to bed.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.897
Look, Sergeant, don't take this wrong,

08:42.980 --> 08:44.857
but the fire didn't start
till after midnight.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.319
Well, then, that was pretty dumb
of me, wasn't it, eh?

08:49.070 --> 08:50.655
Thirty years a cop,

08:50.738 --> 08:54.033
and Stan Jablonski forgets
that you have to have an alibi.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.618
Are you listening to how
that sounds, Fogerty?

08:55.701 --> 08:58.621
I'm listening, Sergeant, I'm listening.
Believe me, I'm listening.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.873
This is nothing we're anxious
to pursue here.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.667
But with the threats,
we got to at least talk.

09:02.750 --> 09:03.584
Ah.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.755
We'll, uh, get back to you,
Sergeant Jablonski.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.886
Maybe you'd better go look
for our witness, the bum.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.054
He'll be called around 2:00.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.473
-Without him, we don't have a case.
-You got an address?

09:17.557 --> 09:21.811
Yeah, a large corrugated box
in the alley between 116th and Royalson.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.229
Grab the gloves.

09:30.069 --> 09:30.903
Hi, honey.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.322
Hi. What are you doing here?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.950
I found this in your pants.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.536
I didn't realize it was missing.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.830
DARYL ANN: I almost put it
in the washing machine.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.208
Did you get to talk to Bobby yet?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.295
Daryl Ann, would you just mind your
own business and go home, please?

09:47.378 --> 09:48.546
Go on, go home.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.048
-Well, I'm sorry.
-RENKO: Just go home.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.514
Bob Moss, Captain. Midtown Vice.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.392
Sure.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.978
-Do you mind?
-FRANK: Please do.

10:07.523 --> 10:10.234
Porno detail searched
a loft last night on West Street.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.279
We were looking for kiddie porn,
hot video equipment.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.948
-They also found this.
-What is it?

10:16.407 --> 10:19.994
One of the shabbiest loops we ever saw.
It happens to star two of your guys.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.954
-I recognized them.
-Who?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.581
LaRue and Washington.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.666
LaRue is getting it on with some babe.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.045
Is it okay if I hang onto this
for a while?

10:29.337 --> 10:32.214
We got all the evidence we need.
It's your ball of wax from here.

10:34.925 --> 10:35.843
(door closes)

10:35.926 --> 10:37.970
NEAL: Hey, Eddie,
that's what the man told me.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.096
Now, would I jive you?

10:39.555 --> 10:40.389
Yeah.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.059
Yeah, okay. Yeah, about 5:00.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.143
Right. Later.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.188
-Where's J.D.?
-The Motor Vehicle Bureau, Captain.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.648
He's getting his license renewed.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.899
Upstairs, you and I.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.486
MICK: They got no evidence.
Besides, I was with you the whole time.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.698
Just being under suspicion
for a thing like this-- it's incredible.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.492
Of course it's incredible.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.744
That's why they're not
going nowheres with it.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.955
Aha, it's the whiff of impropriety,
Detective.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.792
This case doesn't close,
it's with me till I leave the department.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.502
Damn!

11:10.169 --> 11:12.922
People think I might have done
such a stupid, damn thing.

11:13.297 --> 11:17.009
Um, what did you say the owner's name was?

11:17.551 --> 11:18.386
Tommy Leland.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.430
Threats. He said I made threats.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.099
Look, Sarge, I got to go.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.892
I'll check in with you later.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.938
(indistinct conversations)

11:29.021 --> 11:30.731
MAN: Why don't you guys get out?

11:30.815 --> 11:33.442
(laughing)

11:34.819 --> 11:36.487
They got an apartment for you cops, too?

11:36.570 --> 11:37.947
-(chattering)
-Sir?

11:38.030 --> 11:39.865
'Cause if you're gonna keep
these people off of us,

11:39.949 --> 11:42.076
you're gonna have to stay
in the next apartment.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.662
Come on, Moses. Inside's nice.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.831
Inside's a lot nicer than Washington.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.750
I've never been called "nigger"
on my own front door before.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.669
POLICE RADIO:
<i>...Housing Officer's got a code 81.</i>

11:51.752 --> 11:53.421
Uh, excuse us, Mr. Jethroe.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.797
Sorry. Harry?

11:54.880 --> 11:58.884
(siren wailing)

12:05.975 --> 12:06.851
What's happening?

12:06.934 --> 12:09.186
Lieutenant Mitchell, Detective Reiser
were going on break.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.439
They seen the suspect, Timothy,
breaking into this Dodge.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.107
You want us to take him in? We got a van.

12:13.190 --> 12:16.402
Yeah, good. We'll be in after you.
As soon as we find the vehicle owner.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.945
He's the one of the kids
who moved in here?

12:18.028 --> 12:19.739
Believe it. He come in yesterday.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.325
I want this mutt locked up!
I don't want no disorderly on this!

12:23.409 --> 12:25.035
Pig meat! Lying pig meat!

12:25.119 --> 12:26.579
Calm down, Timothy.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.831
Here's the paperwork, more to follow.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.249
This is Mr. Wares.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.335
I was going to my sister's car, man.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.045
They start hassling me, start duking me.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.131
I didn't break no window.
He broke the window.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.966
-Hey!
-Hey!

12:40.134 --> 12:40.968
Easy.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.764
Yeah, that's all we do all day, Timothy--
rob people's radios.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.308
I was going to my sister's car, man!
You lying pig!

12:52.938 --> 12:54.064
-RAY: J.D.
-Yeah?

12:54.148 --> 12:56.108
The captain wants to see you
on the double.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.487
Neal, hey, look at this driver's license.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.781
Man, this is the worst picture
I ever took.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.825
You oughta see the picture me
and the captain just saw of you, lover.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.579
Guys have invented a thousand ways
how to blow this job, J.D.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.122
But man, you own the top five.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.208
Hey, you want to clue me in?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.628
Vice found the home-security tape, J.D.
Captain's not too happy.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.755
Don't it figure?
Try to do a public service.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.964
Oh, wake up, slugger.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.635
Your butt is going to Fiji, baby,
and Furillo's flying the plane.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.597
That stupid sex scene you shot with Lulu.
Man, I told you to walk away.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.308
I never shot a sex scene with Lulu.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.352
Oh, J.D., man, I saw it.

13:33.145 --> 13:36.690
All right, I admit I went back there.
Hey, they were offering cash.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.652
I'm out two grand on my investment,
for crying out loud.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.029
They wanted me to sign a deal
for five more pictures.

13:42.112 --> 13:45.282
They wanted to package me
as Johnny LaRue, the stud cop.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.784
But they had no class.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.118
So you didn't do it.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.663
Somebody must have doctored
the tape somehow.

13:50.746 --> 13:51.580
Where is it?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.624
I gave it to Patsy Mayo.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.086
It's upstairs, man.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.297
Tremendous. I'm losing my job.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.675
My credibility, my life.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.681
-JOYCE: Mr. Goff?
-Yeah.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.975
If you breathe through your mouth,
it's okay.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.563
Mr. Goff, do you remember me?
I'm Joyce Davenport.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.024
I talked to you about what you saw
behind the jewelry store?

14:22.570 --> 14:25.739
Mr. Goff, we've got to get you ready
to testify in court this afternoon.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.241
Do you understand?

14:31.954 --> 14:33.372
We've got four hours.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.290
Right.

14:34.832 --> 14:39.712
Hey, Leo, I need a scrub brush, a bucket,
and three towels downstairs.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.755
And some clothing, Leo, anything at all.

14:41.839 --> 14:45.718
D.A.'s authorized $150.
Get him a shave, haircut, some clothes.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.011
It's not gonna make a dent.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.889
Then get a drink in him if you have to.

14:51.515 --> 14:52.349
Come on.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.852
Do you know what a shower is, Jerry?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.478
Yeah, I do.

14:57.771 --> 14:58.772
If I want to do some breaking in,

14:58.856 --> 15:00.566
why am I doing it
where our apartment's at?

15:02.192 --> 15:04.945
You got burglary on your sheet.
You got assault on your sheet.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.030
Where you coming from?

15:06.113 --> 15:07.990
I had my sister's keys to her car.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.618
Hey, you want to pull
one of them tests on me?

15:10.701 --> 15:11.535
Go ahead.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.372
Hey, look, man,
I'm telling you what went down.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.750
-Which was?
-I was going to the car.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.543
Two detectives start hassling me.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.962
They asked me for some I.D.
I say I don't have none.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.048
Then they say how I'm giving them mouth.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.800
And how they don't need no
smart mouth nigger

15:26.884 --> 15:28.177
round their housing project,

15:28.260 --> 15:30.095
and that's when they start beating on me.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.221
And you fought back.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.475
No, I didn't fight back.
I just let them wail on me.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.227
Hell, yeah, I swung on 'em!
And the two more coming in on me!

15:37.311 --> 15:38.228
Sit down.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.857
Which one would you say broke the window?

15:42.691 --> 15:44.860
(sighs) The guy whose head got broken.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.862
He breaks the car window,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.448
and then says to me,
as if it's me saying it--

15:49.823 --> 15:52.993
"Oh, now I'm in trouble
because I was breaking into the car."

15:53.327 --> 15:55.329
My client is through talking.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.164
What is this, man?

15:57.247 --> 15:59.041
I am your public defender.
Shut your mouth.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.168
Hey, look, I was just telling
them where it was at.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.628
Thanks, Timothy. Got it.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.351
-You're the A.D.A.?
-That's right.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.688
I'm Schnell.
This is Gomez, Detective Reiser.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.357
Here's arrest sheets, memo-book excerpts,

16:23.983 --> 16:26.151
prisoner-refuses-medical forms,
and vouchers.

16:27.277 --> 16:30.322
I'd like to sit with each of you
a couple of minutes individually.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.782
You first, Detective.

16:31.865 --> 16:32.741
Sure.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.326
Why don't you guys wait on the bench?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.286
Just don't mess with the trade, all right?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.999
Did you get the word
I wanted to talk to you?

16:40.082 --> 16:41.333
Yeah, Captain. I'm sorry.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.212
I had to look at this evidence,
and I promise you, this here is a crock.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.630
Yeah? How's that, J.D.?

16:47.297 --> 16:51.427
Okay, I admit, yesterday we made
a home-security film on company time.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.470
No excuses. Go ahead. Dock me a day's pay.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.097
It's already been done
for both you and Neal.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.306
Right.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.017
See, the guy came back here yesterday.

16:58.100 --> 17:02.896
He tells me the security part is unusable,
suggests maybe a little porno insert.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.649
I copped wise, I figured that was
his motive the whole time.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.693
Those look like more than
suggestions to me.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.653
Looks like a genuine
follow-through to me, J.D.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.322
But not with me, Captain.
So I go back there.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.283
I figure maybe I can pop this guy.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.368
Now, I make a thorough
check of the premises,

17:16.452 --> 17:18.203
and his operation, shabby as it was,

17:18.287 --> 17:21.665
was strictly a First-Amendment
situation, Captain, so I walked.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.250
Oh, sure, you walked with that woman

17:23.333 --> 17:25.210
away from the kitchen
table over to the sofa.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.713
At the crucial moments,

17:27.796 --> 17:29.631
you can only see the guy
who's supposed to be me

17:29.715 --> 17:30.883
from the back, Captain.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.176
So?

17:33.844 --> 17:35.804
Here, there's me
in the trench coat, right?

17:35.888 --> 17:40.225
Now, we cut to the come on, hmm?
Cut back to the bed.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.145
Now, we cut to the guy

17:43.228 --> 17:45.647
who's taking the trench coat off--
from behind.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.483
See, the way they edit it, you can't tell.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.069
They make two guys in the same trench coat
look like one.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.279
Me. The guy set me up.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.990
Look, it's a judgment call at best.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.116
Even if I wanted to believe you,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.911
you haven't exactly earned
a lot of credibility with me, J.D.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.331
Wait.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.584
Look, look, there on the left side.
Right there.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.003
It's a tattoo.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.380
I don't have one.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.383
(laughs) I'm innocent.
That guy's a double.

18:14.093 --> 18:14.927
You don't have one?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.012
No.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.097
Uh, J.D...

18:18.180 --> 18:20.390
This is my career, Captain.
Now, you take a look.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.685
The defense rests.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.567
Captain spank your bottom, babe?

18:33.570 --> 18:36.865
And so Detective Reiser
told you he heard or saw

18:36.949 --> 18:38.534
Timothy breaking into the vehicle?

18:38.909 --> 18:43.038
He said that Timothy used his jacket,
like for a muffle when he broke the glass,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.957
so I imagine there wasn't much to hear.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.208
You imagine?

18:47.251 --> 18:49.920
Yes, ma'am, I wasn't there
at the place of occurrence yet.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.590
Thank you, Officer.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.517
Wares is garbage. What do you want to do?

19:04.518 --> 19:05.352
Your client's garbage

19:05.435 --> 19:07.229
-or the case is garbage?
-Both.

19:07.604 --> 19:11.066
Look, I figure something like an attempt
burglar's tools, no time.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.317
Is that what Timothy wants?

19:13.277 --> 19:16.738
You heard him.
He thinks he's Mr. Bathtub Cleanser.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.783
I tell him, "Timothy, look, you've got
four convictions on your sheet."

19:20.200 --> 19:23.120
Believe me, I can get this kid to plead.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.582
I'm not ready to deal yet, Connie.
I'm still interviewing my housing cops.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.666
Bet that's enlightening.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.459
"Duh, the alleged perp kept resisting,

19:29.543 --> 19:34.006
so me and my partners
had to use necessary force to subdue him."

19:34.089 --> 19:35.174
Come on, Joyce.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.552
I can think of things I'd rather do
than file against the city on brutality.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.555
So can we file our bleeding hearts
in the appropriate places

19:41.638 --> 19:43.265
and wrap this up today?

19:46.602 --> 19:47.603
All right, come on. Lift your arm.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.397
Come on, Jerry.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.607
I need a drink.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.691
Be quiet now!

19:52.774 --> 19:54.484
Give me a drink
and I'll do anything you want.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.570
You can't drink now. Just lift your arm.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.823
All right, turn around.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.330
All I could find was a precinct T-shirt
and some coveralls.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.790
Okay. That'll do for now.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.000
Did you dump those rags of his?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.126
Dump?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.545
They walked out of here
by themselves and ate a bus.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.970
Well, congratulations.
You finally smell like a person.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.352
Sit down over here on the bench.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.525
MAN: Here's your coffee.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.987
-Got any hooch?
-MAN: Sorry.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.323
I got some peppermint schnapps
in my locker.

20:42.532 --> 20:43.408
Okay.

20:47.913 --> 20:51.250
Now, look, you gotta go to court,
and you gotta be clearheaded.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.168
You get witness money,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.087
and we can give you that when you're done.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.589
I'm starting to get my recall.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.092
Good.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.260
Well, just drink up.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.513
You know, you cops
are pretty high and mighty.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.598
You throw away my clothes.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.185
You treat me like I got louses.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.855
You<i> do </i>have louses-- lice.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.734
Hey, what would you have
if you lived in a box?

21:18.568 --> 21:19.736
I don't live in a box.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.113
That's the difference.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.199
Big difference.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.120
I remember.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.206
I remember what happened.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.297
Irwin.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.300
Frank?

21:41.383 --> 21:43.385
-I need a couple of detectives assigned.
-What's up?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.720
On the Housing Police bust.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.555
I've got my doubts
about the cop's version.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.889
-The Wares case?
-Mm.

21:48.890 --> 21:52.144
It doesn't make any sense
under the circumstances.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.730
I mean, why would the kid
be busting into a car

21:55.439 --> 21:56.982
so near his own building

21:57.357 --> 21:59.651
when he had his sister's
car keys in his pocket?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.069
What do you think happened?

22:02.154 --> 22:05.657
Pretty much what Wares said--
that he was leaving to go buy some lunch.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.243
Yeah. Henry told me Timothy's story.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.163
Did he tell you Lieutenant Mitchell's
jacket is a quarter inch thick?

22:11.246 --> 22:12.831
Like Timothy Wares' sheet.

22:13.623 --> 22:14.708
Wares is no angel, correct,

22:14.791 --> 22:17.044
but I've talked to three
of the four housing guys.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.670
Schnell and Gomez sound like

22:18.754 --> 22:20.839
they've just memorized
the Pledge of Allegiance.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.591
Reiser's story is completely different

22:22.674 --> 22:24.384
because he was taking
Mitchell to the hospital

22:24.468 --> 22:26.261
and didn't have time to synchronize it.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.848
Add all of that to the already glorious
reputation of the Housing Police.

22:29.931 --> 22:33.352
Joyce, could I present
a couple political realities here?

22:34.269 --> 22:35.437
What are those, Irwin?

22:35.520 --> 22:38.231
We have got an incendiary situation
at O'Neill.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.735
If Timothy Wares sues
the Housing Authority for brutality

22:41.818 --> 22:43.862
two days after the first Blacks move in,

22:43.945 --> 22:46.531
that's fuel in the tinder box,
that's napalm.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.951
So you're suggesting we not divert
ourselves with the truth here.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.788
No, no, no. I'm not suggesting anything.

22:52.871 --> 22:57.042
I'm saying let's accept
a reasonable plea if we can get it.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.335
Hmm?

23:00.504 --> 23:03.090
Frank, after lunch,
I am gonna need A.D. Mendoza.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.216
How are we doing on Seibert?

23:04.299 --> 23:05.175
So-so.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.719
I've got butterflies
about this bum witness.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.137
Hmm. Well, good luck.

23:13.892 --> 23:19.106
Anyway, two detectives on building nine
to see if there's a civilian witness.

23:19.856 --> 23:23.026
I'll assign Cooper and Rangozi,
but I have to say this, Joyce.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.320
What we have here is a broken car window,

23:25.404 --> 23:27.280
a kid with a sheet,
and a cop with a concussion.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.949
By me, that's a strong case.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.492
Also Irwin's right.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.786
We could use some peace over at O'Neill.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.454
Duly noted, Captain.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.498
Maybe a credible witness
will give it to you.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.837
BATES: I say we go with the gray suit.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.505
It's on sale. We're gonna save 65 bucks.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.258
Luce, you can't sell a bum as a banker.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.343
Just look what I'm saying here.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.970
You take this, and you drop it

23:50.053 --> 23:52.514
into the powder blue,
single-breasted polyester,

23:52.597 --> 23:54.099
a pair of cotton blended.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.768
Boom, then the guy looks more
like what he could be.

23:56.852 --> 23:57.769
Which is what?

23:58.145 --> 24:01.690
Which is a guy-- he's unemployed,
a little down on his luck,

24:02.065 --> 24:03.733
but at least he looks like he's trying.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.153
I promise you,
a jury is gonna go for that.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.488
Yeah? The guy is a brick.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.907
You're absolutely dead wrong.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.492
Something I could help you with?

24:12.576 --> 24:15.078
Yes, we need something
to help our friend here

24:15.162 --> 24:16.663
look more presentable.

24:17.080 --> 24:22.878
I would like the, uh,
gray tweed jacket with a brown vest,

24:23.378 --> 24:26.965
knit burgundy tie,
button-down blue oxford shirt,

24:27.924 --> 24:31.887
a black belt, gray slacks,
black patent leather shoes,

24:32.387 --> 24:35.765
size nine, gray wool socks.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.142
That's right.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.603
You know, the guy's dead-on
right about wardrobe.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.940
Yes, sir. Just step this way,
and I'll take you to the fitting room.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.235
You know, there's somebody
living in there.

24:48.778 --> 24:51.781
He asked-- St. Peter asked the guy
to spell "hat".

24:51.865 --> 24:53.700
He said, "H-A-T".

24:53.783 --> 24:55.410
"Sir, you can go on to heaven."

24:55.494 --> 24:57.621
So the next guy, he said, spell top--

24:57.704 --> 24:58.914
What did you say to Rivera?

25:01.500 --> 25:04.044
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-The guy won't ride with me.

25:04.419 --> 25:06.046
I had to hold him up against the wall

25:06.129 --> 25:09.257
for him to tell me
that you warned him off me.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.385
Renko, this is not the time
to talk about this.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.888
You have a good time
talking behind my back.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.390
Why don't you stand up
and talk to me face to face?

25:20.560 --> 25:24.022
All right, you want to get into it, Renko?
First of all, I didn't come to Rivera.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.023
He came to me.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.359
Second of all, he asked me what went down
last night, so I told him.

25:27.734 --> 25:28.735
That I froze?

25:28.818 --> 25:29.819
I didn't say that.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.821
He asked me if you froze.
I said I didn't know.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.657
All I knew is that you
weren't there for me.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.950
Everybody thinks I'm a coward.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.660
Thanks a lot, pal.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.579
He asked me if I thought
it could happen again.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.831
What did you want me to do, lie?

25:41.915 --> 25:43.124
If anything happened to Rivera,
I'd be respons--

25:43.208 --> 25:44.751
You're ruining me!

25:46.211 --> 25:48.463
You're ruining yourself, pal.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.174
(shouting)

25:51.258 --> 25:53.510
JOE: What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you guys? Man!

25:54.094 --> 25:56.596
You got a lot of guts now, Renko!
Where was it last night?

25:56.680 --> 25:57.764
Shut up!

25:57.847 --> 25:58.974
Just go, Bobby!

25:59.558 --> 26:00.600
RENKO: Shut up!

26:01.977 --> 26:03.311
Shut up!

26:03.395 --> 26:04.479
Where was it last night?

26:05.063 --> 26:06.523
Shut up!

26:16.283 --> 26:19.452
Uh, just curious, sir.
How long's it been since you've had a cut?

26:20.328 --> 26:21.413
Five years.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.331
And how would you like it, sir?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.917
Sides just above the ears,

26:26.001 --> 26:29.212
front... down to about here,

26:30.005 --> 26:33.466
parts on the... right.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.970
Give him sideburns right down about here.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.638
Right. Halfway down.

26:39.139 --> 26:43.935
Okay, sir, what I think we'll do here
is start with clearing away some of this

26:44.019 --> 26:47.147
until we get some sense
of the shape of your head.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.064
Okay.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.859
-How long have we got?
-An hour.

26:51.860 --> 26:52.694
We'll do our best.

26:53.069 --> 26:53.987
Smells good.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.031
Smells good in here.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.324
Thank you, sir.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.535
TV:<i> And they're off. In the lead is...</i>

27:00.619 --> 27:03.455
Mr. Goff, will you give your full name
and address to the court, please?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.292
Gerald William Goff.

27:07.375 --> 27:10.253
I don't have an address.
I live on the street.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.547
When was the last time
you had a job, Mr. Goff?

27:13.381 --> 27:14.633
Six years ago.

27:15.508 --> 27:21.598
I was an accountant for Mutual Fidelity
Insurance Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.974
How did you lose that job?

27:23.767 --> 27:27.937
I was fired because of my drinking habits,

27:28.021 --> 27:30.649
which are excessive.

27:32.859 --> 27:36.404
Mr. Goff, can you tell us where you were

27:36.488 --> 27:40.909
at 9:45 p.m. on October 9th of last year?

27:41.951 --> 27:45.830
I was in the alley that runs in back
of Starlight Jewelry

27:46.373 --> 27:48.875
on East 86th Street.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.961
I was lying beside a dumpster.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.215
Were you drunk at the time?

27:55.924 --> 27:58.218
I was just waking up from a drunk.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.261
I was sick but not drunk.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.475
Describe what happened, Mr. Goff.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.186
I saw a man...

28:10.188 --> 28:11.189
that man...

28:11.648 --> 28:15.944
come running out of the back
door of Starlight Jewelry.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.321
He was holding a gun.

28:19.364 --> 28:25.120
He threw it into the dumpster
and ran on down the alley.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.329
Thank you, Mr. Goff.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.456
No further questions, Your Honor.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.586
You're a drunkard and a bum, are you not?

28:33.670 --> 28:36.214
Yes, sir.
I thought I made that clear, sir.

28:36.297 --> 28:39.175
And did the D.A. buy you new clothes

28:39.926 --> 28:42.971
and clean you up
so you could testify against my client,

28:43.054 --> 28:43.930
Mr. Seibert, today?

28:44.013 --> 28:45.223
Yes, sir.

28:46.015 --> 28:50.103
I probably would have scared you people
if you'd seen me this morning,

28:50.520 --> 28:52.856
but that doesn't change what I saw.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.065
Yes.

28:54.816 --> 28:55.859
Moving to that, Jerry--

28:56.317 --> 29:01.531
you call your client by his last name--
Mr. Seibert.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.451
Why don't you give me the same courtesy?

29:05.827 --> 29:06.661
Of course.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.496
Mr. Goff.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.541
I'm curious...

29:11.916 --> 29:14.335
how you managed to
see my client so clearly

29:15.253 --> 29:18.757
when the nearest illumination was from
streetlights over 50 yards away.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.383
Yes, sir, you're right.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.845
It's a very dark alley... normally.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.474
But this was on the 9th,
and there was a full moon--

29:28.558 --> 29:29.559
harvest moon.

29:31.019 --> 29:35.356
At that hour,
it hangs right over the top of the alley.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.569
It was so bright and clear that night,
I could've read a newspaper.

29:39.986 --> 29:41.488
Mr. Goff, you're on record admitting

29:41.571 --> 29:43.948
that you consumed two bottles of wine
that evening.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.200
GOFF: Yes.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.868
LAWYER: And yet you still maintain
you were sober.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.119
I was sober.

29:48.870 --> 29:53.458
You see, sir, my metabolic rate
is nearly twice the norm.

29:53.958 --> 29:59.631
Now, that means that I get drunk quickly,
but I can't stay drunk as long.

30:00.673 --> 30:05.220
This has greatly contributed
to my alcoholism and general decline.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.387
Have you been drinking today?

30:06.471 --> 30:07.305
Yes, sir.

30:08.473 --> 30:14.395
Just enough to keep my hands
from falling out of my sleeves.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.356
(laughter)

30:27.492 --> 30:28.409
Your Honor,

30:28.493 --> 30:30.620
defense requests a conference in chambers.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.997
Recess, 10 minutes.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.082
(bangs gavel)

30:39.379 --> 30:40.880
Seibert's offered to plead.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.423
-Great.
-I said he was gonna do it.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.217
I said you were gonna do it, didn't I?

30:44.843 --> 30:49.305
This is your witness fee, Mr. Goff-- $19.
Thank you again for your help.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.016
Good luck to you.

30:54.060 --> 30:57.689
Uh, look, here's what's left over
from this morning.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.399
It's $23 and change.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.443
Luce and I, we decided
that, uh, you oughta have it.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.655
Man... 40 beans.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.615
I could get myself a room with this.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.742
Yeah, in a boardinghouse
or something like that.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.244
You know, I was thinking,

31:12.453 --> 31:13.663
maybe detox.

31:14.330 --> 31:16.332
Maybe try to get into a program.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.168
I was in one before,
but I wasn't ready for treatment.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.421
Maybe I'm ready now.
Maybe I could try that.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.592
Here. Here's my card.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.427
If you're interested, you just call us.

31:28.678 --> 31:31.347
Okay. Maybe I will. Maybe I really will.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.975
You call and we'll take you
right down to the detox.

31:35.894 --> 31:36.936
You got it, Coffey.

31:37.979 --> 31:38.813
Okay.

31:39.522 --> 31:42.692
You're gonna be hearing from Jerry Goff.

31:46.946 --> 31:47.780
Jerry!

31:49.324 --> 31:50.158
See you, Mr. Goff.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.244
Yeah.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.591
We have to take this into restaurants?

32:06.674 --> 32:08.676
-Sir, I don't--
-HILL: The situation got out of hand--

32:08.760 --> 32:10.303
I don't want whys and wherefores.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.305
What do we do to salvage this situation?

32:13.222 --> 32:14.599
It doesn't salvage.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.602
I'm reluctant to take the next step.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.104
When you've had differences,
you've managed to work through them.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.232
You were in here four years ago,
and it was the end of the line then, too.

32:23.816 --> 32:24.651
This is different.

32:25.944 --> 32:26.778
Andy?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.905
Bobby thinks I'm a liability.

32:28.988 --> 32:31.157
-You are!
-All right, that's it. You're divorced.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.786
Give me a couple of days
to work out reassignments.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.121
May I have the rest of the day, sir?

32:38.414 --> 32:39.248
Thank you.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.587
Andy, uh, could you sit down
for a couple of minutes?

32:49.801 --> 32:51.678
Sorry about what happened at the diner.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.596
In your report from last night,

32:53.680 --> 32:55.932
you said that at the entranceway
to the Projects,

32:56.015 --> 32:58.893
you spent several seconds
in a state of indecision.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.520
What does that mean?

33:01.813 --> 33:03.231
It means I didn't know what to do.

33:04.565 --> 33:07.568
You mean whether or not to wait to see
if the suspect came back out?

33:08.736 --> 33:13.116
The best I can recollect, I just...
(sighs) I didn't do anything.

33:13.199 --> 33:15.827
I just-- my heart was pounding,

33:16.911 --> 33:18.287
and I felt like I was in a nightmare.

33:18.371 --> 33:23.960
I started thinking about Ray Augustine
and his wife and his kids...

33:25.962 --> 33:27.171
and everything.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.261
We all get frightened, Andy.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.348
I don't have the feeling
that's what this is about.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.934
They say in order to be a good cop,

33:40.018 --> 33:42.645
you can't go around
shut off from your feelings.

33:43.354 --> 33:49.736
But, Captain, you've got to shut 'em off,
or else you can't go out there.

33:52.321 --> 33:53.740
I don't know the answer to that, Andy.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.367
I guess every one of us
has to work that out for himself.

33:57.785 --> 34:01.330
I think about all the times
I've pulled Bobby Hill out of the fire

34:01.414 --> 34:03.541
and he pulled me out of the fire.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.003
Let's try it like this for a while
and see what happens.

34:09.130 --> 34:13.092
Captain, everybody thinks I froze.
Ain't nobody gonna ride with me.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.554
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't want to ride with me

34:16.637 --> 34:18.222
if I was on the outside looking in.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.976
Maybe I'll put you in plainclothes.

34:22.935 --> 34:23.770
Let me sleep on it.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.188
Thank you, sir.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.528
Move!

34:37.158 --> 34:39.702
Leo, book this guy, will you?

34:39.994 --> 34:43.539
Manny Tickton,
arson at the Bowlmore Lanes.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.166
Is that "tick" as in tick-tock?

34:45.249 --> 34:46.167
That's right.

34:46.417 --> 34:50.088
Sarge, it happened that
after Manny was read his rights,

34:50.171 --> 34:51.631
he decided to confess.

34:51.881 --> 34:53.091
Ain't that right, Manny?

34:53.174 --> 34:56.511
Mick, a minute of your time. In my office.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.434
Gary, if we're still on,
I'm sprung for dinner tonight.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.977
Oh, great.
Okay, can we go right from here?

35:05.061 --> 35:06.854
Yeah, just pull up to my desk and honk.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.985
First of all, I'm amazed.

35:14.403 --> 35:17.865
Second, I'm not casting
any aspersions, but...

35:18.741 --> 35:19.992
this is a clean bust?

35:20.868 --> 35:21.702
Yeah.

35:22.453 --> 35:26.290
I ask around, I find out that this guy
Leland who owns the Bowlmore Lanes

35:26.374 --> 35:28.376
is into a loan shark for major bucks.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.294
The loan shark has the place torched

35:30.378 --> 35:32.338
so Leland can pay him off
from the insurance.

35:32.755 --> 35:36.217
This guy's confession--
it wouldn't be coerced?

35:37.301 --> 35:38.136
No.

35:38.886 --> 35:41.848
I pulled the loan shark's sheets,
followed up on a few acquaintances,

35:41.931 --> 35:43.975
which led to our suspect, Mr. Tickton,

35:44.058 --> 35:46.519
who just don't want to take
the weight on his own.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.271
This was a very nice thing you did.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.148
-Sarge, it was only shoe leather.
-Yeah.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.441
-Yeah.
-The arson squad should've handled it.

35:52.525 --> 35:53.359
Anyway...

35:54.861 --> 35:56.612
-I'm touched.
-Yeah, okay. So...

35:56.696 --> 35:59.657
Are you bowling against
Midtown tomorrow night

35:59.740 --> 36:00.741
or are you giving up the game?

36:00.825 --> 36:01.826
I'm bowling.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.620
Good, 'cause the team
needs you out there, Sarge.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.705
They got me.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.999
-Good.
-(chuckling)

36:09.709 --> 36:10.960
(indistinct conversations)

36:11.043 --> 36:12.378
Hi. How'd it go?

36:12.461 --> 36:16.424
Great. Seibert pleaded.
My bum witness was a dream.

36:16.507 --> 36:17.508
Congratulations.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.344
I stopped by Mercy,
and I got Lieutenant Mitchell's statement,

36:20.428 --> 36:21.762
which is total crapola.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.391
Frank, I want a polygraph
for Timothy Wares,

36:25.474 --> 36:28.227
and I want to see Detectives Cooper
and Rangozi, if they're back.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.228
They're back, Joyce.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.272
Did they get any statements?

36:31.772 --> 36:32.982
They couldn't find anyone.

36:33.065 --> 36:34.525
Look, I think a deal was made.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.403
What? When?

36:37.486 --> 36:38.696
Maybe you'd better talk to Bernstein,

36:38.779 --> 36:41.365
but Chapman offered,
and even the D.A. felt strongly.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.784
I don't believe this. Were you in on this?

36:43.868 --> 36:46.329
In fact, no, but if I had been,
I would have agreed.

36:46.412 --> 36:47.747
You know my feelings about Wares.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.041
Damn it! What about a witness?
Weren't we looking for a witness?

36:50.124 --> 36:51.334
They didn't find one.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.753
-How long were they out there?
-Long enough.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.380
Today was welfare-check day.
There were a lot of people out there.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.883
So, in fact, there may still be
a witness out there.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.259
Look, Joyce, just forget it.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.220
I'm not reassigning cops to a closed case.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.222
Great. I'll do it myself.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.352
(tires screeching, siren wailing)

37:22.073 --> 37:24.200
-What happened?
-Store owner called it in.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.536
The guy got jumped coming out
of the store, dragged him in the alley.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.207
Jerry?

37:33.584 --> 37:34.418
Lie still.

37:34.752 --> 37:35.920
I went for a walk.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.465
I wanted to buy a newspaper
before I went in.

37:41.133 --> 37:43.719
Broad daylight. Six people saw it.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.680
(Jerry coughing)

37:45.763 --> 37:48.432
All right, hang on, Jerry.
You're gonna be okay, man.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.394
JERRY: They wanted my clothes.

37:52.728 --> 37:55.856
I fought them, no way I was gonna
let them have my clothes.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.360
Just don't say anything.

38:00.111 --> 38:00.945
Don't talk.

38:02.238 --> 38:05.866
I was thinking of something
that my wife said once--

38:24.969 --> 38:27.722
You're a bunch of animals, you know that?
You're a bunch of animals!

38:27.805 --> 38:29.015
Take it easy! Come on!

38:29.098 --> 38:30.349
-Joe!
-Come on!

38:30.433 --> 38:31.892
All right, all right, all right.

38:39.942 --> 38:40.901
Can you cover him up?

38:41.944 --> 38:42.778
Just do it.

38:56.959 --> 38:57.793
Thank you, sir.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.762
-Yes?
-Mrs. McCray?

39:10.598 --> 39:13.351
-My name is Joyce Davenport from--
-From the encyclopedia.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.686
Because this is the last time
I'm gonna be polite.

39:15.770 --> 39:16.937
I don't want it.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.522
I'll give you back the "A" book.

39:18.606 --> 39:22.735
No, no, Mrs., uh, McCray.
I'm from the District Attorney's office.

39:24.236 --> 39:25.905
There was an incident in the parking lot

39:25.988 --> 39:28.074
that happened outside
your window this morning.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.076
You mean with that colored boy.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.119
Right. Did you see any of it?

39:32.536 --> 39:34.413
I tell you one thing
wasn't right about it.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.874
I heard the noise, so I was looking.

39:37.625 --> 39:41.670
And it looked like one of the project cops
busted a car window.

39:42.254 --> 39:43.339
You saw that yourself?

39:43.547 --> 39:44.382
Definitely.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.218
Looked wrong, but I definitely saw that.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.470
After they had the Black youth in custody?

39:49.845 --> 39:51.847
Yes, ma'am, they had handcuffs on him.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.766
I'll need your statement, Mrs. McCray.

39:53.849 --> 39:55.434
Do you have an hour
to come down to Hill Street?

39:56.018 --> 39:57.895
The man who got his head
hurt in the fight--

39:58.270 --> 39:59.855
he's the one who broke the window.

40:00.439 --> 40:03.776
He put his raincoat
right up against it to cover it.

40:04.443 --> 40:07.863
Then when he put his raincoat down,
the window was broke,

40:08.447 --> 40:11.367
so then I figured
it was none of my business.

40:11.450 --> 40:15.704
And I had my check to get to the bank,
so I just left.

40:17.748 --> 40:18.874
Thank you, Mrs. McCray.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.503
Officer, would you put
Mrs. McCray in a cab, please?

40:26.674 --> 40:28.759
-Deal's obviously off.
-Obviously.

40:29.343 --> 40:34.306
We want discovery background on the cops.
Jackets, psychiatric, the whole routine.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.309
Mr. Wares will be asking $300,000.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.980
Could I have a few words
with my colleague, Frank?

40:41.063 --> 40:41.897
Sure.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.319
I've got to take this upstairs, Joyce.

40:47.570 --> 40:48.404
What's that?

40:48.821 --> 40:51.699
This deal was on direct orders
from the D.A. himself.

40:51.782 --> 40:55.286
The guy pleaded voluntarily.
You come in here, you undo the package.

40:55.369 --> 40:58.456
You set up a personal humiliation for me
that, I guarantee you,

40:58.539 --> 41:00.875
with Connie Chapman's mouth,
is gonna be all over the courthouse.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.668
What about your going behind my back?

41:02.751 --> 41:03.919
You were in court.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.087
You could have called.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.881
These were upstairs orders, Joyce.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.175
So we're content to take
a plea from an innocent man?

41:09.258 --> 41:11.010
Why'd he plead if he was so innocent?

41:11.093 --> 41:14.138
Because you offered him a fire sale
and because his P.D. didn't do her job.

41:14.221 --> 41:15.556
That one I can't be concerned about.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.391
-Well, I am.
-Then maybe you oughta go back

41:17.475 --> 41:18.767
and help her out,
if that's your main concern.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.144
-Irwin--
-Don't "Irwin" me!

41:20.227 --> 41:21.437
This one cost us.

41:21.854 --> 41:24.231
It cost us in lawsuits,
it cost us at the Projects,

41:24.315 --> 41:25.858
it cost us in police relations.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.610
You know what else it cost you?

41:28.819 --> 41:29.653
Me.

41:30.279 --> 41:31.113
I quit.

41:35.409 --> 41:37.536
You know,
I would've questioned those people.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.997
When? After your client was doing time?

41:40.080 --> 41:42.750
Don't get high and mighty
because you've got the resources.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.752
You have got the police
to do your work for you.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.046
No good. No good at all, Connie.

41:48.088 --> 41:51.383
You know, people like you--
you have got such damn short memories.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.676
It's mind-boggling.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.930
Any slightest recollection
of 36 cases on your calendar?

41:56.013 --> 41:57.264
The slightest flickering memory

41:57.348 --> 41:59.225
of walking into a room
every day of the week

41:59.308 --> 42:01.435
with murderers, rapists, big-time jerks?

42:01.519 --> 42:04.230
No, you would rather make me out
like some kind of aberration.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.649
A negligent attorney
on account of some twerp.

42:06.732 --> 42:09.318
If he didn't do it today,
he did something the day before yesterday,

42:09.401 --> 42:10.236
and you know it!

42:10.319 --> 42:12.863
I know it, and everybody
in this stinking place knows it!

42:24.041 --> 42:25.042
How's it going, Andy?

42:26.293 --> 42:27.545
Did you talk to the captain?

42:28.337 --> 42:29.380
We'll work something out.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.341
Time, Andrew.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.177
Time heals all problems.

42:37.429 --> 42:41.183
If I thought I was gonna endanger
anybody's life, I'd turn in my badge.

42:41.267 --> 42:42.810
You've got nothing to prove to me.

42:44.019 --> 42:46.230
If it comes down to it,
I'll ride with you myself.

42:47.356 --> 42:49.066
I'll take a shift. I'll ride with you.

42:50.442 --> 42:51.277
I mean that.

42:52.069 --> 42:52.903
Thanks.

42:54.113 --> 42:54.947
Yeah.

42:58.867 --> 42:59.702
It's no good?

43:00.202 --> 43:02.162
Maybe you should've gotten
the almond chicken.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.124
This is you and me.

43:05.958 --> 43:06.959
What's you and me?

43:07.876 --> 43:09.044
Gina doesn't want me.

43:09.128 --> 43:10.504
Henry doesn't want you.

43:11.839 --> 43:12.840
We're leftovers.

43:14.883 --> 43:16.260
That's an appealing thought.

43:17.720 --> 43:18.554
It's true.

43:19.221 --> 43:21.307
(scoffs) Speak for yourself, Harry.

43:22.141 --> 43:27.813
Honestly, you know, I fail to see what
you find so special about this... person.

43:28.522 --> 43:32.651
You mean, besides that she's gorgeous,
rich, and reeks sex out of every pore?

43:33.027 --> 43:36.905
In my opinion, she's phony, manipulative,

43:37.364 --> 43:41.910
and extremely insecure about her sexuality
or she wouldn't flaunt it like she does.

43:42.411 --> 43:46.248
And in my opinion,
she's looking for a daddy, not a lover.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.916
You're better off without her.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.543
Hmm, I know all that.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.588
But every time I see them,
I get head movies.

43:52.921 --> 43:55.633
I see her doing stuff with him
that I wish she were doing to me,

43:55.716 --> 43:56.925
and I want to smash him.

43:59.511 --> 44:02.473
Harry, I would hate to think
that we're sitting here together

44:02.556 --> 44:04.642
because we're both angry
at the same person.

44:05.934 --> 44:06.769
No.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.606
The truth is, Mrs. Furillo,
I asked you out

44:10.689 --> 44:13.192
because I had a really nice time
with you last night.

44:15.736 --> 44:16.737
Why'd you ask me out?

44:19.907 --> 44:21.408
Partly, I<i> was </i>angry.

44:21.950 --> 44:25.829
And, um... partly, I was lonely, you know?

44:26.121 --> 44:28.123
I haven't had a date
since Henry and I broke up.

44:29.291 --> 44:30.417
And partly--

44:31.502 --> 44:32.336
mostly--

44:32.878 --> 44:34.046
I like you.

44:34.129 --> 44:35.130
Thank you.

44:36.090 --> 44:39.218
And, um, could you call me Fay?

44:39.301 --> 44:42.805
As it is, I'm feeling a little bit like
what's-her-name in<i> The Graduate--</i>

44:42.888 --> 44:44.139
Mrs. Robinson.

44:44.515 --> 44:45.349
You're kidding.

44:46.642 --> 44:47.768
You look, uh,

44:48.811 --> 44:50.646
I don't know, 35.

44:51.188 --> 44:52.523
Tops. Maybe.

44:52.606 --> 44:55.693
Fact is, a woman doesn't even
get sexy till she hits 30.

44:56.443 --> 44:57.569
Except Gina.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.154
Yeah, Gina's sexy.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.116
But, truly sexy isn't just physical.

45:03.158 --> 45:04.952
It's also communicating.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.414
And I feel like I can really
communicate with you.

45:10.207 --> 45:11.041
You're real.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.295
Do you know what my life is like?

45:17.005 --> 45:20.134
I go home from work,
and I hit the books until maybe 11:00.

45:20.676 --> 45:21.760
And then I go to the bars,

45:21.844 --> 45:24.221
and I try to pick up women
until final call.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.266
I don't like myself for it,

45:28.892 --> 45:30.519
but I'm afraid to be alone at night.

45:33.772 --> 45:36.066
That's an incredibly good line, Harry.

45:37.025 --> 45:41.530
It's masculine with just
the right undertone of vulnerability.

45:43.949 --> 45:46.285
I bet it goes over great
with the under-21 set.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.746
-Yeah.
-(laughs)

45:48.829 --> 45:50.372
We all have our lines.

45:51.081 --> 45:53.083
Frankly, Harry, I've turned mine all in.

45:54.042 --> 45:58.130
You know, I've reached the age where...
if I don't really care about a guy,

45:58.213 --> 45:59.548
I'd just as soon be alone.

46:01.508 --> 46:03.051
May I take that as a compliment?

46:05.012 --> 46:05.846
You may.

46:12.561 --> 46:14.396
You'll have second thoughts
in the morning.

46:15.105 --> 46:15.939
Maybe I won't.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.232
Maybe Irwin will.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.109
Maybe I won't want him to.

46:20.486 --> 46:21.737
You know, I just don't know.

46:22.696 --> 46:26.325
Maybe I oughta take a few days
and let it sort itself out.

46:27.659 --> 46:29.244
Maybe you should visit your mother.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.497
That oughta take my mind off my troubles.

46:31.580 --> 46:32.915
(laughter)

46:36.710 --> 46:39.254
What did you think of P.D. Chapman's
performance?

46:41.173 --> 46:42.674
I was embarrassed for her.

46:44.301 --> 46:45.302
I really was.

46:46.386 --> 46:48.555
I'll tell you what I think.
I think she's using something.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.140
I'm not sure what, but something.

46:51.475 --> 46:52.851
All that brittleness.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.895
She's jumpy, up and down.

46:56.605 --> 46:58.065
It never occurred to me.

46:58.148 --> 47:00.692
It makes sense. It really would.

47:01.693 --> 47:03.487
Jagged. She's jagged.

47:03.570 --> 47:05.239
And not taking care of business.

47:05.614 --> 47:07.199
You know what I saw today, Frank?

47:08.784 --> 47:10.452
It just plain didn't feel right.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.706
On one side, you had all these
people and interests--

47:15.082 --> 47:17.876
the politics, the cops,
the Housing Authority, the D.A.s.

47:18.293 --> 47:20.546
(sighs)
And over in the challenger's corner,

47:20.629 --> 47:24.758
this one little creep
without even a P.D. really helping him.

47:25.592 --> 47:26.927
He didn't need one. He had you.

47:30.264 --> 47:34.226
I guess I still have
the underdog mentality, hmm?

47:42.734 --> 47:45.320
I like that in a wife. Mm.

47:45.404 --> 47:46.446
JOYCE: Mm.

47:47.656 --> 47:49.449
(chuckling)

47:50.117 --> 47:53.996
If you quit your job,
can you still collect unemployment?

47:54.663 --> 47:56.790
(grumbles)

47:56.874 --> 47:59.710
(chuckling)

48:04.965 --> 48:07.509
(closing theme playing)
