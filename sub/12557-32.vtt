02:15.385 --> 02:18.673
CRASHED INTO THE HILLS

NORTH OF OUR VILLAGE
LATE LAST NIGHT.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.480

02:30.567 --> 02:35.983
INVESTIGATED THE
SCENE OF THE CRASH.

02:36.031 --> 02:40.525
FOUND EVIDENCE OF FOOTPRINTS

02:40.619 --> 02:43.236

03:06.436 --> 03:09.053
WHATEVER IT <i>WAS.</i>

03:09.147 --> 03:12.515
THE PLACE IS MEXICO, JUST
ACROSS THE TEXAS BORDER.

03:12.567 --> 03:16.026
A MOUNTAIN VILLAGE HELD BACK
IN TIME BY ITS REMOTENESS,

03:16.113 --> 03:19.276
AND SUDDENLY INTRUDED
UPON BY THE 20th CENTURY.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.358
AND THIS IS PEDRO,
NINE YEARS OLD.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.740
<i>A LONELY, ROOTLESS LITTLE BOY WHO

WHO DID IT, SANCHEZ?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.315
PLEASE, DOCTOR,
I DO NOT KNOW.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.903
SOME-SOME GIANT THING
ESCAPED IN THE DARKNESS.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.572
I FIRED SEVERAL
SHOTS, AND--

04:09.666 --> 04:11.953
LATER, I FOUND
SOME BLOODSTAINS.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.752
THEY'RE SENDING SOME ARMY MEN FROM THE
STATE CAPITOL. THEY VVILL TAKE OVER.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.627
SOME "GIANT THING"? NOT THE
DARKNESS, OR PERHAPS YOUR FEAR?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.084
YOU DOUBT ME, DOCTOR?

04:21.178 --> 04:24.796
NO, YOU'RE THE LAVV AND ORDER IN THIS
VILLAGE, SANCHEZ. BE THE SANITY AS VVELL.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.131
YOU HAVE FRIGHTENED
ALL THESE PEOPLE.

04:27.225 --> 04:31.014
I JUST VVANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
SOURCE OF THE FEAR IS NOT AN ILLUSION.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.812
THIS, DOCTOR. IS
THIS AN ILLUSION?

04:33.899 --> 04:37.608
ALL RIGHT, GO TO YOUR HOMES,
EVERYBODY, AND LOOK YOUR DOORS.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.856
I WANT NO ONE ON
THE STREETS TONIGHT.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.530
<i>[frightened con versation]</i>

05:04.513 --> 05:06.845

05:06.932 --> 05:10.891
THANK YOU FOR
COMING, STARGAZER.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.561
I AM CURSED IN MY OLD AGE BY HAVING
THIS ASTRONOMER ON MY PAYROLL.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.148
STILL LOOKING AT
THE STARS, PEDRO?

05:18.235 --> 05:20.772
SO, WHAT DO YOU LEARN
FROM THE STARS, EH?

05:20.862 --> 05:24.901
<i>HAVE THEY EVER TOLD YOU TO Sl/I/EEF' THIS'
PLA OE PROPERL Y OR TO OLEANA GLASS?</i>

05:24.991 --> 05:27.858

LIFE ON SOME OF THEM.

05:27.953 --> 05:33.164
OH, THIS IS A FACT? THEN YOU AND THE MAN
IN THE MOON HA\/E NOTHING IN OOMMON,

05:33.250 --> 05:37.835
<i>BECAUSE YOU AREN'T ALIVE.
HERE, GO GET SOME WATER.</i>

05:37.879 --> 05:41.838
AND COME RIGHT BACK. DOORS
SHOULD BE LOOKED TONIGHT.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.883
HE'S A STRANGE LITTLE BOY.
WHERE'D HE COME FROM?

05:47.973 --> 05:51.557
<i>WHO KNOWS? HE'S SON OF
A BRACERO, IT IS SAID.</i>

05:51.643 --> 05:53.930

ASKING ME VVHY HE DOES NOT ATTEND SCHOOL.
THEY ASK ME, HA!

05:57.482 --> 06:00.600
THE BOY IS NOT OF MY FLESH.
I KNOW NOTHING OF HIM.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.938
HE OLEANS THE PLACE FOR ME AND SERVES
TABLE, AND HE HAS A ROOM IN THE BACK.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.363
<i>HEY, I OVERPAY
HIM, BELIEVE ME,</i>

06:07.409 --> 06:09.696
BUT I AM NOT
SUCH A RICH MAN

06:09.786 --> 06:14.371
THAT I CAN CERTAINLY AFFORD TO RUN AN
ORPHANAGE FOR LITTLE STREET URCHINS.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.282
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS, DOES HE?

06:16.376 --> 06:19.539
HIM? VVHY SHOULD HE? HE
HASAMIND LIKE AN OLD MAN.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.706
HE'S NOT NORMAL. GO LOOK
FOR HIM OUT IN THE NIGHT,

06:22.799 --> 06:25.712
AND YOU'LL SEE HIM STANDING
THERE LOOKING UP AT THE SKY.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.214
DID YOU EVER SEE HIM SMILE?
I ASK YOU THIS.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.216
<i>DID YOU EVER
SEE HIM SMILE?</i>

06:30.265 --> 06:33.132
WHY WOULD HE
SMILE, THE BOY?

06:33.226 --> 06:37.595
VVHAT IS THERE TO DELIGHT HIM?
HIS POVERTY?

06:37.689 --> 06:41.307
WHY SHOULD HE SMILE?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.268
PERHAPS, MANOLO,

06:44.362 --> 06:48.651
PERHAPS ON SOME OCCASION,
SOME FESTl\/E OCCASION,

06:48.742 --> 06:51.404
INSTEAD OF HANDING
HIM A BROOM OR A TRAY,

06:51.494 --> 06:54.236
EXTEND HIM A HAND.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.828
KEEP THE BOY INSIDE
TONIGHT, MANOLO.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.664

07:04.758 --> 07:08.922

lWON'T STAY.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.232
PLEASE.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.589
THAT'S NOT WINE.

09:18.683 --> 09:22.096

09:27.525 --> 09:29.983
LDIDN'T WANT
TO HURT HIM.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.445
HE GAVE ME
NO CHOICE.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.818
I MUST EXPLAIN.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.823
PLEASE..

09:40.914 --> 09:45.909
PLEASE. LISTEN
TO ME FOR A MOMENT.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.993
I TRIED TO
EXPLAIN BEFORE

09:48.088 --> 09:51.752
<i>TO THAT POLICEMAN OR
SOLDIER, OR WHOEVER IT WAS.</i>

09:51.841 --> 09:55.675
I TRIED TO TELL HIM
THAT I CAME IN PEACE.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.094
HE WANTED TO KILL ME.

09:58.181 --> 10:03.017
I TRIED TO GET THE
GUN AVVAY FROM HIM,

10:03.103 --> 10:06.266
AND IT WENT OFF
AGAINST HIS BODY.

10:06.356 --> 10:10.315
AND THEN THE MAN VVHO CAME
AFTERVVARDS KEPT FIRING AT ME.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.939
PLEASE. PLEASE.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.941
PLEASE.

10:23.331 --> 10:27.120
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT SOON.
THE DOCTOR HAS SAID SO.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.126
HE WILL MAKE YOU
ALL WELL AGAIN.

10:30.213 --> 10:34.548
IT'S VERY ODD, PEDRO,
VERY ODD, INDEED,

10:34.634 --> 10:37.376
THAT THERE'S
ONLY ONE PERSON

10:37.470 --> 10:40.383
WHO FEELS NEITHER
FEAR NOR ANGER,

10:40.473 --> 10:42.555
<i>AND THIS IS A BOY.</i>

10:42.642 --> 10:44.724
IT IS BECAUSE
WE ARE ALIKE.

10:44.811 --> 10:48.349
YOU ARE A STRANGER, AND IN A
VVAY, I AM A STRANGER, TOO.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.648
PEDRO, THE PONCHO.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.355
<i>WHAT?</i>

10:54.445 --> 10:56.732
IN THE POCKET.
GET IT.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.904
<i>IT'S A GIFT.</i>

11:04.998 --> 11:08.491
PUT IT AWAY. I'LL
TELL YOU LATER ON.

11:23.474 --> 11:27.012
FOR A BADLY VVOUNDED MAN, YOU
HA\/E A STRANGELY VVILLFUL PULSE.

11:30.648 --> 11:35.563
I MIGHT GO A STEP FURTHER AND SAY THAT
I VVISH MINE SOUNDED LIKE YOURS DOES.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.443
PEDRO, BRING THE LAMP
CLOSE TO THE BED.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.241
SI, DOCTOR.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.548
ETHER?

12:02.639 --> 12:07.054
I'M GOING TO START DIGGING IN
THERE FOR AT LEAST 3O MINUTES.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.601
NO ANESTHETIC, DOCTOR.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.645
PEDRO, I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR
YOU TO GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE STARS.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.324
YOU HAVE A GOOD
FRIEND, SENOR.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.698
DOCTOR, YOU MUST
GIVE HIM SOMETHING.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.667
PEDRO, I VVILL TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I'M A VERY OBLIGING MAN,

12:34.754 --> 12:38.918
BUT YOUR FRIEND DOES NOT
WANT THE PAIN DEADENED.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.217
AND I ALWAYS SAY, EVERY
MAN TO HIS OWN TASTE.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.699
[groaning softly]

13:14.002 --> 13:16.835
WHISKEY. IF NOT THE BEST,
MAKE IT THE STRONGEST.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.041
THE STRANGER
TRAVELS LIGHT.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.627
JUST THE CLOTHES
ON HIS BACK, AND--

13:26.055 --> 13:27.841
AND THESE
INSIDE HIS CHEST.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.675
HE WAS VERY BRAVE, DOCTOR.
NOT A SOUND FROM HIM.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.979
NOT SO MUCH AS A
CRY ALL THAT TIME.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.312
YES, VERY BRAVE.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.226
PEDRO, COME HERE.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.156
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
KNOW OF HIM, PEDRO?

13:51.205 --> 13:55.574
I KNOVV NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT
THAT HE IS MY FRIEND.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.581
YES, THIS MAY BE TRUE,

13:58.671 --> 14:02.630
BUT IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN
THE MAN, DOES IT?

14:02.717 --> 14:06.585
FOR EXAMPLE, IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN HOVV A MAN
CAN HA\/E TVVO BULLETS INSIDE HIS BODY

14:06.679 --> 14:11.048
AND HAVE THEM REMOVED
WITHOUT A WHIMPER.

14:11.142 --> 14:14.885
IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN HOVV THIS MAN'S
PULSE CAN BE AS STRONG AND AS STEADY

14:14.979 --> 14:17.687
<i>AS IF THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE
WRONG WITH HIM THAN A COLD.</i>

14:20.568 --> 14:23.902
AND IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN VVHY THIS MAN
IS ALl\/E VVHEN HE SHOULD BE DEAD.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.447
WE GOT TO HIM
JUST IN TIME, DOCTOR.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.777
NO, PEDRO. VVE GOT TO HIM
ABOUT THREE HOURS TOO LATE.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.364
VVE GOT TO HIM VVHERE BY THE LAVVS
OF EVERY BOOK ON COMMON SENSE

14:35.458 --> 14:38.667
HE SHOULD HA\/E BLED TO DEATH.
BUT HE DIDN'T.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.216
SO, STAY BY YOUR FRIEND, HUH?
AND LOOK AFTER HIM.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.671
SI, DOCTOR.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.092
MANOLO.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.394
WHEN I WAS IN THERE,
I HEARD THE DOOR UNLOCK.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.276
OH, I-| WENT
OUT, DOCTOR.

15:08.366 --> 15:11.779
I WENT OUT TO TELL SANCHEZ
THAT WHEN THE ARMY CAME,

15:11.869 --> 15:15.237
THEY VVOULD NOT HA\/E TO GO VVALKING
THROUGH THE HILLS AT NIGHT.

15:15.331 --> 15:19.245
THEY VVOULD ONLY HA\/E TO COME
HERE TO FIND VVHAT THEY VVANT.

15:19.335 --> 15:23.499
AT YOUR BAPTISM, THEY FORGOT
TO GIVE YOU A PROPER NAME.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.672
WHAT WOULD
THAT BE, DOCTOR?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.878
THAT WOULD BE
JUDAS, MANOLO.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.168
YOU MUST BE TIRED, PEDRO.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.549
IT DOESN'T
MATTER, SENOR.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.303
I CAN SLEEP ANYTIME.
NOW YOU MUST SLEEP.

16:17.351 --> 16:21.720
YOU HAVE A POET, PEDRO.
I READ HIM. ROBERT BURNS.

16:21.814 --> 16:26.308
HE SAID, "THE BEST-LAID
SCHEMES O' MICE AND MEN

16:26.402 --> 16:28.985
GANG AFT A-GLEY."

16:29.030 --> 16:32.022
LIKE MY PLANS.

16:32.116 --> 16:35.575
I CAME HERE TO GIVE, AND
ALL I'VE DONE IS TO TAKE.

16:35.661 --> 16:39.154
YOUR BED, YOUR ROOM.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.661
EVEN MY CLOTHES.
I STOLE THEM.

16:42.710 --> 16:48.001
L'\/E OFTEN VVONDERED VVHY IT
IS THAT MEN FEAR THE UNKNOVVN.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.673
LIKE CHILDREN, THEY'RE
AFRAID OF THE DARK.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.094
THE ONLY PERSON I'VE MET

16:55.181 --> 16:58.344
<i>WHO ISN'T AFRAID OF
THE DARK, IS A CHILD.</i>

16:58.434 --> 17:00.675
BECAUSE I AM AN ODD ONE.

YOU COME FROM A LONG

17:09.028 --> 17:10.530
FROM THE STARS?

17:10.613 --> 17:14.527
FROM BEYOND
THE STARS, PEDRO.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.449
<i>FOR A REASON?</i>

17:16.536 --> 17:17.901

17:17.994 --> 17:20.373
AND THIS THING
YOU'VE GIVEN ME.

17:20.455 --> 17:23.574
JUST A GIFT.
A GESTURE, REALLY.

17:23.667 --> 17:27.536
A SMALL GIFT TO SHOW THEM
THAT I CAME AS A VISITOR,

17:27.630 --> 17:30.042
NOT AN INVADER.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.749
I MUST GET BACK
TO MY SHIP, PEDRO.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.425
SEE IF I CAN REPAIR IT.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.970
<i>AND THEN
I MUST LEAVE.</i>

17:37.056 --> 17:39.297
FOR GOOD, SENOR?
FOR GOOD AND ALL?

17:39.392 --> 17:44.307
OH, NO, PEDRO, THERE'S NO SUCH
THING AS "FOR GOOD AND ALL."

17:44.397 --> 17:47.059
THERE IS ONLY FOREVER.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.733
I WILL COME
BACK SOMETIME.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.405
WHERE YOU'RE FROM,
IS THERE A GOD?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.949
THE SAME GOD, PEDRO.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.618
<i>I WONDER.</i>

18:00.705 --> 18:04.824
IF GOD VVERE TO COME TO EARTH,
VVOULD THEY FIND HIM SO STRANGE

18:04.917 --> 18:08.626
THAT THEY WOULD BE AFRAID,
AND WOULD THEY SHOOT HIM?

18:08.713 --> 18:11.671
DID NOT HIS SON
COME ONCE, PEDRO?

18:11.757 --> 18:14.089
AND THEY NAILED
HIM TO A CROSS.

18:14.176 --> 18:18.090
AND THEN SPENT 2,000 YEARS
LEARNING TO BELIEVE IN HIM.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.847
ALL THINGS
TAKE TIME, PEDRO.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.143
<i>SOON, PEDRO, SOON,</i>
