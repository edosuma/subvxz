WEBVTT

00:14.681 --> 00:15.932
Skadoosh.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.705
I've underestimated Po.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.708
Clearly, my best aren't up to the task.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.960
But if anyone can help me catch him…

00:44.753 --> 00:46.796
-It's you.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.257
Never!

00:49.340 --> 00:52.093
I refuse to give up information
on my beautiful boy.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.387
I'd rather die!

00:54.471 --> 00:58.475
Whoa! Hey. I was just gonna have you
send him a letter or something.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.144
You'd have to shoot me with your crossbow!

01:01.227 --> 01:02.062
Whoa, there.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.523
-You'd have to snap my neck in half!
-Excuse you.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.151
You'd have to rip me limb from limb,

01:08.234 --> 01:10.028
chop me up into little tiny pieces,

01:10.111 --> 01:11.696
fire me into the sun,

01:11.780 --> 01:13.448
collect my ashes, and reassemble me

01:13.531 --> 01:16.618
before I let one word escape from my bill!

01:16.701 --> 01:19.621
I didn't expect such a fight
from a common cook.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.039
Cook?

01:21.539 --> 01:22.457
Common?

01:23.041 --> 01:26.002
You have to be a little crazy
to open a restaurant.

01:26.086 --> 01:30.173
I'm telling you,
60% fail within the first year,

01:30.256 --> 01:32.884
and almost 80% by the fifth.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.636
Go ahead, go ahead, try me.

01:34.719 --> 01:39.098
I'm a loose cannon
loaded with paternal love…

01:39.182 --> 01:40.391
Uh, your Highness.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.727
Let go!

01:42.811 --> 01:44.562
Excuse the, uh, interruption,

01:44.646 --> 01:49.150
but a very impatient old monkey
is here to sell you a, uh…

01:49.234 --> 01:50.068
whip?

01:54.197 --> 01:56.157
I'm a sucker for impulse buys.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.159
Bring them to me!

02:01.579 --> 02:03.414
-Ooh!

02:12.423 --> 02:15.176
Now that's how
you make a dramatic entrance.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.109
Woohoo! Yes! We did it!

02:32.026 --> 02:35.280
We caught Klaus and Veruca,
or whatever their names are.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.490
You can call me anything you like,

02:37.574 --> 02:39.325
hunky bear.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.369
Uh… Okay.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.787
Kind of uncomfortable now.

02:42.871 --> 02:43.705
So,

02:43.788 --> 02:45.957
I suppose it's time for us to--

02:46.040 --> 02:48.668
Do the secret handshake
we never came up with?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.421
To part ways.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.843
Partnerships end when the goal is met.
That's how these things work.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.557
Oh. Uh… Right.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.687
What? What are you doing? What is that?

03:07.770 --> 03:10.148
Bring it in. Hug time.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.233
No, knights don't hug.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.484
What? Wait a second.

03:13.568 --> 03:17.113
You're telling me knights and squires
aren't constantly hugging?

03:17.196 --> 03:18.197
Goodbye, Po.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.742
So long, hunky bear.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.829
Safe journeys to you.

03:37.425 --> 03:41.012
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Your mission isn't over,
and, uh, neither is mine.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.722
I said I'd guide you through China,

03:42.805 --> 03:45.099
and that means
all the way through to the docks.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.143
Don't you need to return the gauntlet?

03:47.810 --> 03:50.772
So I'm a disgraced former Dragon Master
for one more day.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.066
I know where the whip is,
I'll head there after.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.693
He knows where the whip is.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.862
I heard that too, Klausy, I did.

04:02.909 --> 04:03.743
Veruca!

04:03.826 --> 04:07.121
Cackle a bit less obviously, would you?

04:07.205 --> 04:08.039
Right.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.878
Let me help you one last time.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.505
Plus, I know a shortcut.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.012
-Very well.
-Yes!

04:23.096 --> 04:26.266
-Yes!

04:26.349 --> 04:27.350
High five.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.646
Or not. That's cool, that's cool.
We'll get that later.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.732
Po and Blade! Po-lade!

04:35.316 --> 04:36.901
Blade-po!

04:37.485 --> 04:38.653
Blo!

04:38.736 --> 04:41.656
Oh,
please don't mash our names together.

04:50.248 --> 04:54.168
Great Emperor,
I come to you this day with an offer.

04:54.752 --> 04:59.173
A weapon of immense power,
capable of defeating any foe.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.759
Any foe, huh?

05:01.843 --> 05:02.927
Any foe.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.554
-Big foes?
-Any foe.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.597
-Big foes who--
-Any foe!

05:11.686 --> 05:13.980
But it won't come cheap.

05:14.063 --> 05:19.027
I'm not walking out of here
with less than half of China's treasury.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.059
You're serious.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.185
Mm-hm.

05:53.978 --> 05:54.979
Well, where is it?

05:57.857 --> 06:00.193
That's it? A stick?

06:00.276 --> 06:01.778
I have sticks!

06:01.861 --> 06:05.364
Uh, shuffle her out into the snowbank,
or wherever we put them.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.216
Oh!

06:32.934 --> 06:37.230
As I was saying,
I'm not leaving without half the treasury.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.691
Sounds like a steal.

06:46.405 --> 06:49.700
Alls we gotta do is rent a boat,
head downriver, and bam,

06:49.784 --> 06:50.827
we hit the docks.

06:50.910 --> 06:51.744
Shortcut!

06:53.287 --> 06:56.207
Uh-oh. Only two boats left, huh?

06:56.791 --> 06:57.917
Yeesh.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.546
Ah, now we're talking.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.465
Ooh, and it comes
with a convenient cup holder.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.427
Hi, we'd like to rent your boat.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.685
I don't want any trouble.

07:15.768 --> 07:19.188
In fact,
I'm not even here. I, um… Nope.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.524
-I, uh… I left a few minutes ago.
-Uh…

07:21.607 --> 07:22.817
We can still see you.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.695
But I can't see you,
which is what matters.

07:25.778 --> 07:29.031
I've seen the posters.
You're wanted by the Emperor.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.826
Oh, that's all a big…
Look, these are our prisoners.

07:31.909 --> 07:32.994
We're the good guys.

07:33.077 --> 07:36.080
Stand still
or I'll turn you into weasel pudding.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.834
Is this what sunlight feels like?

07:39.917 --> 07:42.712
She only lets us out of our rooms
once a month.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.214
Sorry. No boat for you.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.967
Aw, man. No cup holder.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.305
Did I just hear
you're a wanted criminal on the run?

07:54.557 --> 07:57.518
M-Maybe we focus
more on "wanted" than "criminal."

07:57.602 --> 08:02.023
Oh ho ho, that's rich!
Hunky bear's a fugitive too?

08:02.106 --> 08:04.650
Hey, I'm only a criminal
because of what you guys did.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.861
Playing the blame game, are we, sweets?

08:06.944 --> 08:08.112
You know that saying:

08:08.196 --> 08:11.782
if you look around and don't know
who the criminal is, it's you.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.243
Wait, what? That makes no sense.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.579
Enough! Will you rent to us or not?

08:16.662 --> 08:17.830
Take it!

08:17.914 --> 08:20.833
Fugitive from the government?
I hate the government.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.419
Kudos to you for sticking it to the man.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.712
Here's the anchor.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.841
Uh, shouldn't it be
tied to a rope or something?

08:28.925 --> 08:29.759
Eh.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.139
Thanks for your generosity, good sir.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.390
Just be careful.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.309
It's a lease.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.436
A lease!

09:07.046 --> 09:09.173
Are you sure this is a shortcut?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.342
This thing seems slow.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.929
Yeah. This is, like, the shortest shortcut
to get through China.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.348
For sure. Definitely.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.309
Super short…

09:21.435 --> 09:23.938
Oh, Pandy Wandy is so fuzzy.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.023
-I just wanna give him a hug.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.817
Stay focused, Veruca.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.195
-We've got to find a way--
-Don't even think about it.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.199
The only thing
I'm thinking is you need a mint.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.662
Good morning, Dragon Master.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.416
Lovely day for a walk, isn't it?

09:43.916 --> 09:47.003
Yes, there's nothing
quite like a lovely stroll

09:47.086 --> 09:48.838
to get you where you want to be.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.425
Shortcut?

09:52.508 --> 09:55.344
-He's walking faster than we are!

09:57.179 --> 09:59.098
Fine day, indeed.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.977
That's it! We're getting out.

10:03.060 --> 10:07.315
No, no, no. It's faster, Blade. I promise.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.777
Pandas…

10:11.861 --> 10:14.196
What are you gonna do? Am I right?

10:28.294 --> 10:29.712
Are we there yet?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.881
We're almost there.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.132
Maybe halfway.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.635
But we're making great time.
Probably.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.971
Take your time,
Pandy Wandy Fuzzy Poppy Fluff!

10:48.356 --> 10:51.359
I'm so excited for the Moon Festival!

10:53.569 --> 10:56.489
Yeah! The Moon Festival!

10:56.572 --> 10:58.157
Moon Festival?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.826
Moon Festival?!

11:00.910 --> 11:02.745
Moon Festival…

11:02.828 --> 11:06.082
-Moon Festival?

11:06.165 --> 11:07.917
Wha-- What?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.961
Who knew that the Moon Festival
would be on our shortcut?

11:11.045 --> 11:12.922
Not this guy.

11:13.756 --> 11:17.843
-It's the day of the Moon Festival.
-Yeah, the Moon Festival!

11:17.927 --> 11:21.263
-The Moon Festival's upon us! Yay!
-Hooray for the Moon Festival!

11:21.847 --> 11:25.351
-Yay! The Moon Festival's upon us!

11:27.228 --> 11:29.188
I'm so excited for the Moon Festival!

11:29.271 --> 11:32.274
There's got to be a way through.
Try to pass that boat on the left.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.484
No one's moving.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.987
Can't use my powers
if we're stuck on the water.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.447
Do something, would you?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.867
Patience, Veruca.
Our opportunity will come.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.703
How awfully confident
for someone who ain't got no plan.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.914
Who says I don't have a plan?

11:51.293 --> 11:52.670
Try to pass them on the right.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.840
No, trust me,
we stay in the left lane, it's way faster.

11:55.923 --> 11:56.882
Just do it!

11:59.718 --> 12:01.345
Wait your turn!

12:02.012 --> 12:04.181
-Whoops! Oh, sorry!

12:04.265 --> 12:08.102
Got distracted placing my drink
into this convenient cup holder.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.187
Aw, man! Lucky.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.565
Let's walk the rest of the way.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.024
Not a terrible idea.

12:14.108 --> 12:18.112
Oh! Wouldn't mind
a stretch of the ol' legs, I wouldn't.

12:18.195 --> 12:21.407
I don't know what mind tricks
you're trying to play, but quiet!

12:21.490 --> 12:24.160
Hey, I know it's stressful,
but if we go with the flow,

12:24.243 --> 12:27.746
we'll get through the festival and reach
the docks faster than if we'd walked.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.458
In the meantime, just look around!

12:30.541 --> 12:33.669
What better place to spend
your last day in China? It's fun.

12:36.380 --> 12:40.718
I know, knights don't "fun."
Not even when they're surrounded by it.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.261
But, come on!

12:42.344 --> 12:44.221
They're tied up. Try to relax.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.140
Knights don't relax, either.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.478
Okay, let's compromise.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.063
How about 50% relaxed, 50% vigilant?

12:53.147 --> 12:56.233
How about 99% vigilant, 1% relaxed?

12:56.317 --> 12:57.985
Deal. Wait…

12:58.486 --> 13:01.197
Ninety-nine percent… Fifty-one… Aw…

13:11.081 --> 13:12.374
Blade!

13:12.458 --> 13:14.919
You can't leave China
without learning to play erhu!

13:19.965 --> 13:22.468
Yeah, I've never played it.
I'm more of a flute guy.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.056
Blade! Look at this.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.266
You can't leave China
without poking a mummy.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.102
This is a Chinese cultural experience?

13:32.186 --> 13:33.687
It should be.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.616
-Too gross. I'm done.
-Gross!

13:52.998 --> 13:56.043
Blade! You can't leave China
without eating dim sum.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.512
Service is terrible here.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.056
You don't go
to dim sum for the service.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.267
You go for the taste.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.228
Mm, mm, mm.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.815
Oh. Mm. This is--

14:17.898 --> 14:20.818
Right?
A little piece of heaven?

14:20.901 --> 14:23.112
Mm, mm, mm.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.657
You know, I have to admit,
today was pretty fun.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.118
I guess it really is okay
to be 1% relaxed--

14:29.201 --> 14:32.162
Help, guards! We've been kidnapped.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.041
There he is! The Dragon Master!

14:36.125 --> 14:40.087
Like I said, 1% relaxed is 1% too much.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.797
Oh no! What are we gonna do?

14:41.881 --> 14:45.217
You are hereby under arrest
for stealing the WuGao Gauntlet.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.428
Hi, yeah. Funny story,

14:47.511 --> 14:51.140
I was just on my way to return it
after capturing the actual thieves.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.142
Please! You have to help us.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.103
This madman abducted us from our homes!

14:56.186 --> 14:58.022
He's mad crazy insane, he is!

14:58.105 --> 14:58.939
Hm?

14:59.023 --> 15:01.317
What? No! That's not true.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.987
I was going to the Emperor
to clear it all up. I love the Emperor.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.074
This Emperor?

15:13.954 --> 15:14.955
-That's them!

15:15.039 --> 15:16.582
They stole from our shops.

15:16.665 --> 15:17.917
A priceless vase!

15:18.000 --> 15:18.959
What?

15:19.043 --> 15:22.087
An erhu!
Not priceless, but it was up there.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.925
They just took brushes from me,
but they had sentimental value.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.802
Okay, that's ridiculous.
Where would I even put that stuff?

15:30.846 --> 15:32.431
-Over here?
-Huh?

15:40.064 --> 15:42.149
So, you're gonna love this.
Paddle.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.985
We were on our way to see you--
Paddle, Blade, paddle!

15:45.069 --> 15:45.986
Whoa!

15:48.614 --> 15:51.951
Ugh! I knew these two were
up to something. They set you up.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.703
-We did!
-Classic us.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.498
He's getting away! Follow him!

16:01.794 --> 16:03.295
-Shashabooey!

16:24.358 --> 16:25.234
It's here!

16:25.317 --> 16:26.485
Wow!

16:26.568 --> 16:28.570
It's so beautiful!

16:35.744 --> 16:36.954
Huh?

16:47.881 --> 16:48.882
This way.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.986
I think they headed this way.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.617
Move it.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.167
This is not how I saw today going.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.418
What do you mean?

17:24.918 --> 17:26.003
The festival!

17:26.086 --> 17:28.213
You knew the festival was today?

17:28.797 --> 17:31.675
Uh, I mean, not the festival. I, uh…

17:33.385 --> 17:35.637
I may have noticed a flier.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.810
-Hm…

17:43.812 --> 17:45.856
You're leaving, and it happened so fast.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.192
I just wanted to have
one more fun day together!

17:48.275 --> 17:50.194
I can't believe you lied to me!

17:50.277 --> 17:52.112
You know how important this mission is,

17:52.196 --> 17:55.032
you knew I was anxious,
and you used that against me!

17:55.115 --> 17:57.409
This is what happens
when you trust people.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.411
You were just gonna leave forever!

17:59.495 --> 18:02.581
So I wanted to show you
what you'd miss about China, and…

18:03.165 --> 18:05.250
Maybe what you'd miss about me.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.461
You wanted to trick me into having fun?

18:07.544 --> 18:09.838
I wanted to encourage you
to admit we're friends.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.215
Why is that so hard for you?

18:11.298 --> 18:13.133
Because we're not friends.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.641
And I'm very glad
this is our last day together.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.102
Wow.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.482
This is where our mission ends.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.527
You don't even want me
to walk you to the docks?

18:31.610 --> 18:34.363
I think I'll be better off on my own.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.782
Goodbye, Po.

18:38.867 --> 18:42.162
Uh, how about just "until we meet again"?

18:44.039 --> 18:45.999
Hey!

18:46.083 --> 18:47.876
Hey, give that back, plant!

18:47.960 --> 18:49.253
Not a plant.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.923
Credit where credit's due.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.424
-Dark magic!
-Whoa!

18:57.261 --> 18:58.387
No. No.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.430
No!

19:00.514 --> 19:02.266
I won't let it end this way!

19:04.810 --> 19:06.895
Wouldn't do that if I were you.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.733
-Huh?

19:11.817 --> 19:15.654
Tell us where the whip is or
I'm turning the cute one into plant food.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.541
I lied to you
because I wasn't ready to let go.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.293
A real friend wouldn't do that.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.170
I'm sorry, Blade.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.594
Don't let them
get another weapon because of me.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.679
Some ideas for my epitaph:

19:40.762 --> 19:44.558
"Here lies Po, kung fu master,
and five-time Little Mister Plum Blossom."

19:48.395 --> 19:50.105
A monkey named Rukhmini took the whip

19:50.189 --> 19:52.941
to the Emperor's vacation palace
in the Northern Mountains.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.985
Blade! What are you doing?

19:55.777 --> 19:58.030
Wouldn't be lying to us, would you?

20:14.463 --> 20:16.715
Another time, Pandy.

20:33.774 --> 20:37.152
So… why am I not plant food?

20:38.320 --> 20:41.365
Klaus and Veruca are
on the way to the Emperor's palace.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.868
That means the gauntlet
and the whip will be there.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.412
And we're going to go get them.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.165
-We?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.166
Together?

20:51.708 --> 20:52.709
A team?

20:54.670 --> 20:59.216
You still owe me a shortcut,
but now we need it to meet the Emperor.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.177
Come on, squire.
We still have a mission to finish.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.638
He's not gonna be happy to see me.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.476
What's Little Mister Plum Blossom?

21:09.559 --> 21:13.146
A very cool competition for good boys
and I'm not ashamed of it.

21:45.095 --> 21:49.599
Oh, finally! After 30 long years…

21:49.683 --> 21:51.184
Now, hand over the whip.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.938
-Oh, once I'm outside, you'll get it.

21:57.941 --> 22:00.527
But you were never going to get outside.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.541
Well, at least it's a fair fight.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.585
-Get on with it then!
