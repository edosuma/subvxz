WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:03.371
(indistinct conversations)

00:10.178 --> 00:12.146
Kinda looks like
a serial killer.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.081
(chuckles)

00:14.215 --> 00:16.484
It's a self portrait.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.152
Okay, I'm just saying.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.787
Sean, I love it.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.555
I love the colors
that you used.

00:21.589 --> 00:22.723
It's really good,
don't you think?

00:22.756 --> 00:24.325
Mm-hmm.
No.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.060
Yeah, it's good.
Joanne, hey.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.828
Hi.
How you doing?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.263
Hi, Mike.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.231
Danny, you remember

00:30.264 --> 00:31.332
Joanne, right?
How you doing?

00:31.365 --> 00:32.266
Hi.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.734
And Chris Keenan.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.669
The cop, right?

00:35.703 --> 00:37.271
Detective.
You on the job?

00:37.305 --> 00:38.172
FDNY.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.207
Ah! Good. Good.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.274
Remember, Dad,

00:40.308 --> 00:43.544
you said firefighters
sleep all the time, right?

00:43.577 --> 00:46.214
I said firefighters
sleep upstairs

00:46.247 --> 00:47.615
in the firehouse
when they're not

00:47.648 --> 00:49.750
putting out fires.

00:49.783 --> 00:53.121
I'll bet your dad likes donuts.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.688
My dad? He loves donuts.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.327
Well, you know what,
why don't we all catch up

00:59.360 --> 01:02.196
at the coffee and dessert table?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.197
Sounds good.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.365
See ya.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.134
Can I go with Michael?
Yeah, go play.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.101
Yes.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.237
Hey, Michael, want to
hang out after this?

01:11.239 --> 01:12.540
Divorced?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.508
Separated.
How'd you know?

01:14.542 --> 01:16.210
I'm a detective.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.178
Yeah, you are.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.113
Okay, pal, thanks a lot.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.314
Just the way
you like it.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.184
I thought you were
checking to make sure

01:23.217 --> 01:24.051
he was licensed,
not buying lunch.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.520
When a fella makes gyros
as good as Cleo,

01:26.554 --> 01:28.256
he's an asset
to the neighborhood.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.757
I like to support
local business.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.559
You ever eat anything that's
actually good for you?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.561
Do Cocoa Puffs count?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.763
No.
MAN:
Fire! Fire!

01:35.796 --> 01:36.697
Oh...

01:36.730 --> 01:38.332
There's a fire!

01:38.366 --> 01:40.834
Go for help!
There's a fire!

01:40.868 --> 01:43.204
(coughing)

01:46.307 --> 01:47.608
I called 911.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.742
There's a baby in there.

01:48.776 --> 01:49.877
Where exactly?

01:49.910 --> 01:53.347
In the apartment on the second
floor, facing the street.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.348
Reagan!

01:54.382 --> 01:56.417
Wait, buddy! FDNY!

01:56.450 --> 01:57.818
(sobbing):
...my baby!

01:57.851 --> 01:59.487
Central, please
be advised,

01:59.520 --> 02:02.656
I got a 59
of a story residential.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.792
540 East 129th Street.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.597
Jamie!

02:12.533 --> 02:16.437
(onlookers clamoring)

02:16.470 --> 02:18.472
(sirens approaching)

02:19.673 --> 02:21.775
(fire truck horn blaring)

02:24.878 --> 02:27.481
Is he breathing?
Yeah! Yeah!

02:27.515 --> 02:29.850
(coughing)

02:33.754 --> 02:34.888
How old is he?

02:34.922 --> 02:35.923
I don't know.

02:35.956 --> 02:36.757
His parents?

02:36.790 --> 02:37.758
I don't know.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.630
Set up a humidifier
with six to ten liters

02:42.663 --> 02:43.797
of non-rebreather mask.

02:48.802 --> 02:49.670
Is he gonna make it?

02:49.703 --> 02:51.805
His lungs sound clear,
so it's a good sign.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.377
(siren blaring)
You okay?

02:56.410 --> 02:57.911
Yeah.
(coughing)

02:57.945 --> 02:58.912
Huh?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.681
Yeah.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.250
You done good, kid.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.251
Yeah.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.552
Real good.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.592
Really?
Ever. Yeah.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.793
Right now.
(electronic weapons fire)

03:12.826 --> 03:15.363
Hey! No video games
at the table.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.864
But I'm done with dinner.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.299
Well, Sean is
still eating.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.467
I'm done.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.734
Come on, give it up.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.473
(cell phone buzzing)

03:25.506 --> 03:26.840
And no phones
at dinner.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.409
Respect your mother.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.677
You, too, Giggles.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.847
Boys, why don't you go play for
a minute while I start dessert.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.519
Here. Go on up
to your room, okay?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.520
Okay, thanks.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.621
What's wrong, babe?

03:40.654 --> 03:44.925
I just got an e-mail
from one of the moms at school.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.427
Chris Keenan.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.828
Yeah, the firefighter we met.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.430
He hanged himself.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.834
(sighs)

04:02.876 --> 04:04.778
I thought you were gone.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.046
Must be wishful thinking.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.650
Two uniforms responded to calls
for help while on meal break,

04:09.683 --> 04:12.286
a residential building on fire.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.854
One of them saved a baby

04:13.887 --> 04:15.756
right before
the fire department got there.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.591
What's the rest?

04:17.625 --> 04:21.929
The officer who rescued the baby
was your son Jamie.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.803
(sighs)

04:29.837 --> 04:34.041
Pull him off patrol and have him
in my office forthwith.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.943
Try and keep a lid on this.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.883
(sighs)

05:07.808 --> 05:10.811
Did anybody witness
you come out with the baby

05:10.844 --> 05:13.847
before you handed him off
to Sergeant Renzulli?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.751
I don't know.
I'm just not sure.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.019
We interviewed
everyone at the scene.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.688
We haven't got
any witnesses

05:20.721 --> 05:22.923
that saw Officer Reagan
rescue the baby.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.359
Well, I know I don't
have to tell you this, Vic,

05:25.393 --> 05:26.760
but in terms of
threat assessment,

05:26.794 --> 05:28.762
Officer Reagan
cannot be identified.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.731
Big difference between
walking a beat

05:30.764 --> 05:32.966
and landing
on the front page.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.903
Which brings us to my inbox,
which is full of requests from

05:35.936 --> 05:38.772
the press to meet the officer
responsible for saving the baby.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.841
Whether he's on the
front page or page 20,

05:40.874 --> 05:43.644
putting Officer Reagan's face
out there in an NYPD uniform

05:43.677 --> 05:46.547
is going to blow our
undercover operation.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.482
Not to mention
put Officer Reagan at risk

05:48.516 --> 05:50.851
if the Sanfino crime family
recognizes him.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.986
We got to get
out in front of this.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.888
I'd like a word
with the commissioner.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.457
In private.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.970
I'm sorry about all this.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.705
Sorry for what?

06:11.739 --> 06:12.940
For saving a baby?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.041
For doing your job?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.076
I know what you were thinking
during the meeting.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.111
Do you now?

06:18.145 --> 06:21.014
That you should've talked me out
of all this undercover stuff,

06:21.048 --> 06:22.816
to keep me out of danger.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.019
I just want you to know, Dad,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.821
that it wouldn't have mattered
even if you tried.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.961
Thank you for that.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.565
But it's not
what I was thinking, Jamie.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.600
I was thinking
I'm really proud of you.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.051
JOANNE: If it wasn't
the firehouse,

06:58.085 --> 06:59.787
it was the
construction company.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.489
He was always
running off somewhere.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.090
He was always late coming home

07:03.123 --> 07:05.926
'cause of some
emergency at work.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.195
Even when he
was here...

07:10.230 --> 07:12.900
...it felt like
he wasn't here, you know?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.235
I'm so sorry.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.704
Dad?

07:16.737 --> 07:17.505
Hey.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.439
I think you should
talk to Michael.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.844
Is he okay?

07:23.877 --> 07:24.945
I'm not sure.

07:24.978 --> 07:25.879
I'll go talk to him.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.481
Okay.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.188
You like hockey?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.924
Yeah, sure.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.159
Your dad like hockey, too?

07:39.192 --> 07:41.194
He loved it.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.934
He took me to my first Islanders
game when I was, like, five.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.169
That's pretty cool.

07:49.202 --> 07:52.806
My dad took me
to my first Rangers game

07:52.840 --> 07:55.509
when I was about six.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.778
Now, I don't
remember it very well.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.582
We just sat up in the nosebleeds
and ate a lot of hot dogs.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.685
Think I got sick.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.287
Did you ever
break a promise to Jack?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.222
Not if I could help it.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.592
Well, neither did my dad.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.563
He promised he would take me

08:15.596 --> 08:17.230
to the Islanders-Rangers game
on Sunday.

08:17.264 --> 08:21.168
I'm really sorry
about your dad, Michael.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.804
You're a detective, right?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.706
Yeah, I'm a detective. Why?

08:25.739 --> 08:29.142
So, you can prove that my dad
didn't kill himself.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.544
Whoa.

08:30.578 --> 08:31.545
Kid, I...

08:31.579 --> 08:33.046
I'm not a kid.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.314
I know my dad.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.916
He didn't kill himself.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.751
Okay.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.087
No one believes me.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.623
Can you help me?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.060
Please?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.836
REPORTER:
Less than 24 hours ago,

08:55.869 --> 08:58.338
the building seen behind me
was in flames.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.874
Six-month-old Raymond Lopez
was rescued by

09:00.908 --> 09:03.210
an as-yet-unidentified
New York City Police officer,

09:03.243 --> 09:04.778
who risked his own life

09:04.812 --> 09:06.346
by running into
the burning building.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.315
The boy's mother asked
the department to meet

09:08.348 --> 09:11.218
the brave officer, so she can
thank him personally.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.086
BAKER: Commissioner, I have
Sergeant Renzulli for you.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.287
REPORTER:
Police Commissioner Frank Reagan

09:14.321 --> 09:17.224
has not yet responded
to this request.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.094
Good morning, Commissioner.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.330
Morning.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.733
Sorry to pull you
off the road. Again.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.268
Is this about
what happened last night?

09:28.301 --> 09:29.369
It is.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.873
Yeah, all of a sudden,
we were pulled off of patrol

09:32.906 --> 09:35.142
and told to shut up about it.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.777
If this is about keeping quiet

09:36.810 --> 09:39.847
pending an investigation into
Jamie getting a commendation,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.249
then I'll write it up myself.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.284
I mean, you should've seen him.

09:44.317 --> 09:48.756
When he came out of there
with the kid in his arms and...

09:51.258 --> 09:55.162
Well... it is about
a commendation.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.197
Sit down, please.

10:05.072 --> 10:08.241
For the past six
months, on occasion,

10:08.275 --> 10:10.310
Officer Reagan has
been pulled off

10:10.343 --> 10:12.345
the duty with you
to work undercover.

10:14.214 --> 10:17.284
I can't tell you the nature of
it-- you have no need to know.

10:17.317 --> 10:21.221
But... it involves some
pretty serious business

10:21.254 --> 10:23.924
and some very
bad people.

10:23.957 --> 10:29.329
With the incident last night and
the appetites of the press...

10:29.362 --> 10:31.231
It'll blow his cover.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.400
Exactly.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.435
And compromise
the operation.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.138
Would it put his life in danger?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.440
(sighs)

10:40.473 --> 10:42.042
Yes, it would.

10:45.145 --> 10:50.818
It's a hard thing to ask
a proud and able police officer

10:50.851 --> 10:55.388
to take credit for something
someone else did,

10:55.422 --> 10:59.459
and an even harder thing
for the one being asked,

10:59.492 --> 11:01.995
but that's exactly
what I'm asking you to do.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.001
You want me to pretend
that I saved the kid?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.137
I'd like you to consider it.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.240
That's some kind of hero.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.779
The hardest part--

11:18.812 --> 11:21.348
you can't tell anyone.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.417
Not even your wife.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.856
I understand.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.725
Thank you.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.263
Oh.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.968
I love this border.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.803
Well, he's outgrown it, babe.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.204
He's 11 years old.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.806
Do you remember
when he was little

11:45.839 --> 11:47.941
and he used to wear
that conductor's hat

11:47.975 --> 11:49.409
and blow that train whistle?

11:49.442 --> 11:52.145
Yeah, I remember.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.047
You know,

11:54.081 --> 11:55.715
we could have another one.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.920
I got three kids already.
I think that's enough.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.088
(phone ringing)
Oh, really?

12:01.121 --> 12:03.456
Three kids?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.358
Daniel Reagan.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.995
Just a couple of questions.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.764
12:00 is great.
M.E.'s office?

12:10.798 --> 12:13.500
All right.
I'll see you there.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.301
I thought you
were off today.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.936
I just need a couple
of hours, okay?

12:15.969 --> 12:17.504
And besides, it'll give that
wallpaper you love

12:17.537 --> 12:19.439
a stay of execution.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.841
I'll see you later.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.976
He's moved on
to baseball, anyway.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.878
Well, at least it's the Mets.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.314
And at the rate he's growing,
pretty soon it's gonna be

12:27.347 --> 12:29.516
Sports Illustrated
swimsuit models and...

12:29.549 --> 12:30.250
Yeah.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.420
(sighs):
Oh, yeah, yeah. Great.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.831
So what autopsy is it
you think I screwed up?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.866
I don't think you
screwed up any autopsy.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.835
Which means you think
I missed something.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.436
Hand me that heart, will ya?

12:51.571 --> 12:54.407
Did you know the human heart
weighs only eight to ten ounces?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.508
Didn't know that.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.511
It's amazing the chaos
that little organ can cause.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.447
Look, I'm here
about Chris Keenan.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.416
Keenan had an inverted "V"
at the base of his skull...

13:03.450 --> 13:04.885
from the rope.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.187
The cause of death
was strangulation.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.456
Okay, but there were
no other marks on him?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.458
Okay, he was in construction,

13:11.491 --> 13:13.493
he was a firefighter,
he was full of marks.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.462
Okay, well, what
kind of other marks?

13:15.495 --> 13:18.298
He had a trauma to the head,
his elbow was scraped up.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.368
He broke his arm in
the past, and his leg.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.971
Why are you looking
into a suicide?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.106
Well, because maybe it wasn't
a suicide at all.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.008
Is there some new evidence?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.442
No.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.111
'Cause the detective who
handled the case

13:31.144 --> 13:33.313
told me Keenan
was suicidal.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.215
His wife was divorcing him,
and he was devastated.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.284
Which brings us right back
to that little organ

13:37.317 --> 13:39.386
right in there--
a broken heart.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.454
Right. Look, plenty of
people go through divorces

13:41.488 --> 13:43.423
and they don't go
and hang themselves.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.959
You are asking me
to re-open this. Why?

13:45.993 --> 13:47.895
Let's just say the family's
not convinced

13:47.928 --> 13:49.362
that it was a suicide.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.031
Well, you know what
the first stage of grief is?

13:51.064 --> 13:52.232
Denial. Right.
I know what you're gonna say.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.301
Well, I'm gonna say no.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.903
I've got a dozen bodies

13:55.936 --> 13:58.105
waiting for autopsies
and you want me to waste time

13:58.138 --> 13:59.639
re-examining one
I've already completed

13:59.672 --> 14:01.308
for no apparent reason.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.044
Why don't you come back
when you have one.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.416
GORMLEY:
Isn't this your day off?

14:09.449 --> 14:11.284
You're not happy
to see me, Sarge?

14:11.318 --> 14:12.385
I'm always happy
to see you, Reagan,

14:12.419 --> 14:14.521
because it means my day
will be anything but boring.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.023
Well, I do what I can.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.424
All right, you want
to explain to me

14:17.457 --> 14:19.026
why I'm hearing
from the two-seven squad

14:19.059 --> 14:20.493
that you're
investigating a death

14:20.527 --> 14:23.430
that they've classified
as a suicide and closed?

14:23.463 --> 14:25.532
It's about the firefighter
who hanged himself, Sarge.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.400
The guy from
Staten Island?
Yeah.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.069
Mm-hmm.
He's a friend of yours?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.237
Not exactly.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.039
So why are we doing this?

14:33.073 --> 14:35.142
Because his son asked me to.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.010
Uh-huh.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.411
The guy's son
is a kid, isn't he?

14:38.445 --> 14:40.180
Yeah. He's 11.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.581
Okay, let me get
this straight.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.550
An 11-year-old kid
asked you to re-open

14:43.583 --> 14:46.219
his father's suicide case,
and you said "Sure!

14:46.253 --> 14:49.556
We don't have enough real
homicides to investigate."

14:49.589 --> 14:51.324
Sarge, it's my day off, okay?

14:51.358 --> 14:53.093
Just humor me, all right?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.561
That seems to be all I ever do.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.230
Look, I'm just gonna do a little
poking around, all right?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.599
I'm not gonna cause any waves
for you, don't worry.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.269
(taps desk three times)

15:07.107 --> 15:08.208
All right, it's clear.
Come on.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.244
I'm looking for Dylan Carney.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.179
You see Dylan Carney?

15:12.212 --> 15:14.147
He's right behind me.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.315
Dylan Carney.
Detective Reagan.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.250
I need to ask you a few
questions about Chris Keenan.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.186
I already answered a bunch
of questions about him

15:19.219 --> 15:20.387
with the other detectives.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.355
Okay, well, let's call this a
follow-up then, all right?

15:22.389 --> 15:24.191
You and him were
good friends?

15:24.224 --> 15:27.027
We own a company together,
Bray Head Construction.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.296
This make any sense to you?
Him committing suicide?

15:29.329 --> 15:30.630
No, doesn't make sense.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.632
Does anything like this
ever make sense?

15:34.301 --> 15:36.603
But I wasn't surprised
when I got the call.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.971
What do you mean
you weren't surprised?

15:38.005 --> 15:39.672
'Cause he's going through

15:39.706 --> 15:41.574
a divorce he didn't want...

15:41.608 --> 15:43.676
and he's got
big financial troubles.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.046
Whoa, whoa, what kind
of financial troubles?

15:46.079 --> 15:48.548
This last project we bought
this big old house.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.417
Remodeled it...
You mean the house
that Keenan was...

15:50.450 --> 15:53.020
Yeah. Anyway,
it cost twice what

15:53.053 --> 15:55.388
we thought it would
to fix it up.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.657
So Keenan takes out a home
equity line on his house--

15:57.690 --> 15:59.192
$150,000.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.027
150... That's pretty steep.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.295
Why didn't you
just sell the house?

16:02.329 --> 16:04.264
'Cause we needed to get
the certificate of occupancy.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.765
We couldn't get it.
Why not?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.135
Y-You ever deal with
the Buildings Department?

16:08.168 --> 16:10.037
All right, I mean, inspectors
coming and going.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.272
They're always finding something
else that needed to be done.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.641
All right?
Months, months went by.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.277
And then the bank comes
looking for its money.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.412
So Keenan was defaulting?

16:19.446 --> 16:21.781
The bank told him
they were gonna be foreclosing.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.385
Right. And you think
that's what made him suicidal?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.686
Would it make you suicidal?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.724
Listen, the guy had a...

16:31.758 --> 16:33.293
life insurance policy

16:33.326 --> 16:35.362
was worth half a million
dollars, all right?

16:35.395 --> 16:37.397
He knew, he knew that
would get his family

16:37.430 --> 16:38.631
out of the hole.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.267
He spoke to you
about this recently?

16:40.300 --> 16:41.668
About this
life insurance policy?
We went out

16:41.701 --> 16:43.370
a couple of weeks ago
for drinks together.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.671
And he told me...

16:44.704 --> 16:47.407
he's worth more dead
than alive to his family.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.478
All right.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.555
Thanks.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.328
Look, Dad, I know
what you're gonna say.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.796
This kid, he's just
looking for answers

17:09.829 --> 17:12.365
to why his old man died,
and he felt like

17:12.399 --> 17:13.333
nobody would listen to him.

17:15.468 --> 17:19.372
I know it looks like an open
and shut case of suicide,

17:19.406 --> 17:22.475
but I just couldn't say no
to the kid, you know?

17:22.509 --> 17:25.478
I wish you'd understand.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.414
As the commissioner, I can't.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.815
As your father, I won't.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.184
Right.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.154
As a cop...

17:34.187 --> 17:37.157
I understand.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.660
What can I do to help?

17:40.693 --> 17:44.431
Well, for starters
the, uh...

17:44.464 --> 17:46.633
M.E. refuses to, uh,
take another look

17:46.666 --> 17:48.635
at the autopsy.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.438
Okay.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.307
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do

17:54.341 --> 17:57.710
if it turns out this guy
did commit suicide?

18:00.447 --> 18:01.748
Have you thought about

18:01.781 --> 18:04.351
what you're gonna say
to this kid?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.363
Morning.
How's it going?

18:17.730 --> 18:18.865
RENZULLI:
Hey, Reagan.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.300
Hey, Sergeant.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.402
You were undercover
and you didn't even tell me?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.670
Who told you that?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.738
That's what you're
worried about, who told me?

18:25.772 --> 18:28.375
You ride with me nearly
every day, for a year,

18:28.408 --> 18:30.210
and you don't even
think to mention it?

18:30.243 --> 18:32.645
I wasn't supposed
to tell anyone.
I didn't think
I was just anyone.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.715
So, instead, I got to hear it
from the PC?

18:35.748 --> 18:36.683
I'm sorry.

18:36.716 --> 18:37.850
Yeah. You know what?

18:37.884 --> 18:39.619
Forget it, Reagan.
It's no big deal.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.821
It's nice to know
that you trust me.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.624
Hey... Sarge...

19:12.519 --> 19:14.187
Hm.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.469
MAN: I sure as hell
won't talk you down.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.438
You Reagan?

19:31.471 --> 19:32.605
Yeah.

19:32.639 --> 19:33.840
Detective Battali,

19:33.873 --> 19:35.542
two-seven squad.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.911
Oh, you're the guy that
caught the Keenan suicide, huh?

19:38.945 --> 19:41.348
Yeah. Oh, and that's
my file you're holding.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.316
Yeah, so it is.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.517
Hey, I was just borrowing it.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.919
I mean, we're all on the same
side here, anyway, right?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.488
You tell me.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.357
I closed the case.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.592
Yeah, you closed
the case but, uh,

19:52.625 --> 19:54.361
there was a footprint
on the chair

19:54.394 --> 19:55.862
that didn't belong to Keenan.

19:57.464 --> 20:00.900
Yeah. Evidence collection said
it was a size ten and a half.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.669
Keenan was a size 12,

20:02.702 --> 20:04.804
so, obviously, it didn't
come from him.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.473
So what?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.508
There were a dozen guys
working on this site.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.710
Any one of them could've
used the chair to stand on

20:10.743 --> 20:11.844
for some other reason.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.446
Then did you try
to match the print

20:13.480 --> 20:14.847
to rule out
the other dozen guys?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.816
For what?

20:16.849 --> 20:19.852
The guy was
a classic suicide case.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.621
He was in financial trouble,
he was in legal trouble,

20:21.654 --> 20:23.390
and his wife had
just kicked him out.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.392
Right.
Well, I'm not convinced.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.328
Look, are you hurting
for cases or something?

20:28.361 --> 20:29.596
'Cause I could send
some your way.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.331
Real cases.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.666
You know, I've got 22 of them
I'm working on right now.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.469
Relax. Nobody said
you didn't do your job.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.505
Okay?
No?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.540
'Cause that sounds
exactly like what you're saying.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.475
If you think you could
do a better job...

20:42.509 --> 20:44.711
Of course I could,
but that's beside the point.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.878
Screw you.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.914
Put your hands on me again,

20:47.947 --> 20:49.749
I'll put you through the wall.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.454
(indistinct arguing)

20:57.590 --> 20:59.526
(sighs)

20:59.559 --> 21:02.028
(phone rings)

21:02.061 --> 21:02.895
Hey, Dad.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.997
I just got off the phone
with the M.E.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.500
She took another look
into the Keenan autopsy.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.469
It seems it was
blunt force trauma,

21:09.502 --> 21:11.571
which she now believes
could've resulted from

21:11.604 --> 21:12.905
a blow to the head.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.041
What a surprise.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.809
How'd you manage that?

21:16.843 --> 21:19.011
It's hard to say no
to the police commissioner.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.682
Anyway, she is officially
changing manner of death

21:22.715 --> 21:25.752
to "undetermined,"
pending investigation.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.454
(muffled shouting)
That'll be a big help, Dad.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.791
Reagan.
Yeah, Sarge.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.092
In my office now!

21:33.125 --> 21:34.494
Sounds like you gotta go.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.763
Yeah. Thanks.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.367
MOORE: Now that you've
taken care of one son,

21:40.400 --> 21:41.968
investigating a death
he shouldn't be,

21:42.001 --> 21:43.603
do you want to talk about
how we're going to keep

21:43.636 --> 21:44.471
Jamie out of the paper?

21:44.504 --> 21:46.606
Are you referring
to Officer Reagan?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.575
That's a distinction
without a difference.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.009
The fact that
we haven't released

21:50.042 --> 21:51.544
the hero cop's name

21:51.578 --> 21:53.480
is only drawing
more attention to it.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.648
I still haven't returned calls
from the Times,

21:55.682 --> 21:57.550
the New and the Post.
The longer that we

21:57.584 --> 21:59.419
sit on this, the bigger
the story's gonna get.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.620
I'm working on it.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.754
Care to share?

22:01.788 --> 22:04.691
I'm not good at that.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.727
"I'm not going to
make any waves."

22:07.760 --> 22:09.061
Isn't that
what you said?

22:09.095 --> 22:10.563
Yeah, that's what
I said, Sarge.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.098
So, why did I have
to stand there

22:12.131 --> 22:14.401
with the captain from the
two-seven squad telling me

22:14.434 --> 22:15.502
how much he had to talk

22:15.535 --> 22:16.969
his detective out of going
to the union with this?

22:17.003 --> 22:19.506
Come on, Sarge,
that guy was a schmuck.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.607
He said you accosted him.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.941
(knocking)

22:21.974 --> 22:24.010
Hey.
Finally, somebody
I can reason with.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.846
Finally someone
who understands me.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.147
Wow, I like this.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.650
I go away one day,
I come back all appreciated.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.919
Yeah, well, he's not playing
well with others again.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.621
Come on, Sarge,
the M.E. just changed

22:34.654 --> 22:36.055
the manner of death
to "undetermined."

22:36.088 --> 22:37.390
How'd you manage that?

22:37.424 --> 22:39.392
I know people.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.394
Are you up to
speed on this?

22:41.428 --> 22:42.294
Yeah, I read the file.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.362
He had blunt force
trauma to his head.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.532
Right, which the M.E.
now says may have been caused

22:45.565 --> 22:46.699
by someone hitting him.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.568
And he also was in
debt up to his ears.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.002
That's right, and look
at this picture, Sarge.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.004
And this photo was taken
of the chair

22:52.038 --> 22:54.106
that Keenan used
to allegedly hang himself.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.143
These footprints, Sarge,
they don't belong to Keenan.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.413
No one else at the
scene followed up?

23:00.447 --> 23:01.948
Exactly--
that schmuck detective

23:01.981 --> 23:03.550
didn't even bother
to follow up.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.485
Okay, I get it,
you made your case.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.520
Consider the investigation
yours now.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.488
Thank you.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.622
But no fights. Okay?
Okay.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.858
No tussles with the FDNY,
All right!

23:11.891 --> 23:14.994
and no complaints from
the M.E.'s Office.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.729
All right?
Yep.

23:16.763 --> 23:21.601
And, please, no threatening
to put anyone through a wall.

23:21.634 --> 23:22.602
Capisce?

23:22.635 --> 23:23.670
Capisce.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.738
I know a couple
firefighters

23:25.772 --> 23:27.474
over at Keenan's
engine company.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.208
I'm gonna see if I can
find out anything.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.044
Give me a call, let me know
what you find, Jack.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.180
Thanks, Sarge.
I thought for sure

23:34.213 --> 23:36.449
you were going to tell me
to drop the case.

23:36.483 --> 23:38.084
Well, first of all,
if I told you that,

23:38.117 --> 23:39.185
you'd do it anyway, right?

23:39.218 --> 23:40.687
Probably.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.888
And second of all,

23:41.921 --> 23:43.923
you're the best pain
in the ass I have.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.026
ERIN: I don't want to hear
about a subpoena.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.160
I want to talk about Jamie.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.629
He could have gotten
himself killed.

23:49.662 --> 23:50.763
DANNY:
Yeah, but he didn't.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.231
He saved
a kid's life.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.233
I know, and I'm proud
of him for that,

23:54.266 --> 23:55.968
but I guess I'm
just not used to him

23:56.002 --> 23:57.169
putting himself
in harm's way.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.005
Well, you see, I'm not
the only knucklehead

23:59.038 --> 24:00.139
in the family.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.609
Besides, he should be more
concerned about the publicity.

24:02.642 --> 24:03.943
Why?

24:03.976 --> 24:05.945
Because he's still
working undercover,

24:05.978 --> 24:06.879
and you didn't
hear it from me.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.515
Look, are you gonna
give me the subpoena

24:08.548 --> 24:10.149
for Chris Keenan's
phone records or not?

24:10.182 --> 24:12.785
Okay.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.253
Just like that?

24:14.286 --> 24:15.454
Okay, but

24:15.488 --> 24:17.990
it's very circumstantial,
so I'm warning you, I don't want

24:18.024 --> 24:20.092
Thank you, sis.
to see you back here
looking for a search warrant

24:20.126 --> 24:21.961
or a subpoena
without something concrete!

24:21.994 --> 24:23.996
Talk to you later, sis!

24:24.030 --> 24:26.633
(groans)

24:26.666 --> 24:27.967
BAKER:
We're anticipating
approximately

24:28.000 --> 24:29.602
25 members of service

24:29.636 --> 24:31.504
and upwards of 35 news
agencies at the dedication.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.573
They're bound to ask you
the name of the officer

24:33.606 --> 24:34.574
who saved the baby.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.142
Baker, would you
please sit down?

24:36.175 --> 24:38.144
You're making me nervous.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.179
I need a minute.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.018
Why didn't you tell me

24:46.052 --> 24:47.587
that Jamie was
undercover?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.221
You've been talking
to Danny.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.790
Who says I've been
talking to Danny?

24:50.823 --> 24:52.191
Because he's the only one
who knew about it.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.960
Well, why didn't
you tell me?

24:53.993 --> 24:55.094
You had no need to know.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.096
This is Jamie
we're talking about.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.631
He hasn't even been
on patrol that long.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.966
For God's sakes,
three years ago,

24:59.999 --> 25:01.934
he's graduating from law school.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.571
He's not Danny,
he is not ready for this.

25:04.604 --> 25:08.240
He's not only ready for it,
he's good at it.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.241
(sighs)

25:09.275 --> 25:10.577
I wish he wasn't.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.079
When he went
undercover, it was

25:13.112 --> 25:15.047
for some stupid
underage drinking thing,

25:15.081 --> 25:17.917
he ends up infiltrating
the Sanfino crime family.

25:17.950 --> 25:22.722
This, this hero stuff-- this
is going to get him killed.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.256
Danny told you
about that, too?

25:24.290 --> 25:25.892
Why wouldn't he
tell me that?

25:25.925 --> 25:28.060
Because you had
no need to know.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.896
Why do you keep
saying that to me?

25:29.929 --> 25:31.163
Because that's my job!

25:34.634 --> 25:36.603
The rest of the family
doesn't know about this.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.772
Pop doesn't even know
about this.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.240
That's my job, Erin.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.180
When this thing came down

25:48.214 --> 25:50.149
we needed to put
a lid on it.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.784
Jamie came up to the 14th floor.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.886
After the meeting...

25:55.054 --> 25:57.023
...he wanted to know
what I was thinking.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.058
I told him I was proud of him.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.364
I didn't lie.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.300
(sighs)

26:08.334 --> 26:10.870
But I didn't tell him the truth.

26:12.304 --> 26:16.275
What I was thinking was,
I can't lose another son.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.917
Well, I can't lose
another brother, Dad.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.797
Sarge, just take a look
at the phone records.

26:37.830 --> 26:38.865
Chris Keenan called
Dillon Carney

26:38.898 --> 26:40.833
three times the day he
supposedly killed himself.

26:40.867 --> 26:41.634
That's not unusual.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.202
They shared a
business together.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.004
Yeah, well, what is unusual

26:45.037 --> 26:46.238
is that a couple
of Carney's buddies

26:46.272 --> 26:47.373
down at the firehouse
said that he

26:47.406 --> 26:50.810
and Keenan had a major
disagreement the day he died.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.244
What big disagreement?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.246
He didn't say nothing to me
about any disagreement.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.749
The guys told me that
they were screaming and yelling

26:56.783 --> 26:58.785
at each other
and that Carney threatened him.

26:58.818 --> 26:59.919
About what?

26:59.952 --> 27:00.887
That I don't know,

27:00.920 --> 27:02.354
but they said
that they heard Carney say,

27:02.388 --> 27:04.290
"If you tell anyone,
I'll kill you."

27:05.424 --> 27:07.994
Well, that certainly makes
him a suspect, right?

27:08.027 --> 27:09.896
Yeah, let's go see
Carney again

27:09.929 --> 27:11.831
and see if we can't get
his story straight.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.300
Who told you that?

27:14.333 --> 27:17.003
Don't worry about who told
us anything, all right?

27:17.036 --> 27:17.837
Just answer
the question.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.305
Chris and I were
friends, all right?

27:19.338 --> 27:20.172
We were always
getting into it.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.008
That's the kind of
relationship we had.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.009
We were like brothers.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.176
Like brothers?

27:24.210 --> 27:26.345
You know, your brother's lying
on a slab in a funeral home.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.379
Meanwhile, you're giving us
the runaround,

27:27.413 --> 27:29.381
not helping us find out
how the hell he got there.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.282
What did you fight about?

27:30.316 --> 27:32.384
I wanted to...

27:32.418 --> 27:33.853
bribe the building inspector,

27:33.886 --> 27:35.354
so that we could
finally get the C of O,

27:35.387 --> 27:36.555
finally sell this house.

27:36.588 --> 27:40.259
But Keenan had this thing
about doing anything illegal.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.161
Did you tell Keenan that you
would kill him

27:42.194 --> 27:43.162
if he said anything?

27:43.195 --> 27:45.364
But it was about the bribe.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.833
I didn't want to jeopardize
my standing either.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.735
Yeah, hey, it's all
about the bribe.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.036
You pay the bribe or not?

27:50.069 --> 27:51.938
No, I didn't pay it,
but Keenan said

27:51.971 --> 27:54.240
he was gonna go meet the
guy and set him straight.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.875
Yeah, I guess
he set him straight.

27:55.908 --> 27:56.943
What makes you think
this guy

27:56.976 --> 27:58.410
would have accepted
a bribe, anyway?

28:00.279 --> 28:02.314
I'd heard he'd taken
bribes before.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.254
Did Carney tell you exactly

28:08.287 --> 28:10.122
how Keenan was going to set
that inspector straight?

28:10.156 --> 28:11.323
No, but by
all accounts

28:11.357 --> 28:13.292
this guy Keenan is a
pretty stand-up guy.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.360
Carney says
he never heard from him

28:14.393 --> 28:15.795
after he went
to see the inspector.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.063
Well, Carney said
the inspector's name

28:17.096 --> 28:20.432
is a Thomas Reid, and he swears
that the guy asked for bribes.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.068
Well, I'm not surprised.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.302
Did you know all these
building inspectors

28:23.335 --> 28:25.437
are outfitted
with GPS devices now?

28:26.505 --> 28:27.306
They were passing inspections

28:27.339 --> 28:29.308
without ever showing
up at the sites.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.442
How do you know that?

28:30.476 --> 28:32.311
'Cause my brother-in-law
is one.

28:33.345 --> 28:34.947
Don't ask.

28:34.981 --> 28:36.983
Well, either way, I think we
should bring this guy Reid in.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.250
What's your theory-- you
think Reid killed him?

28:38.284 --> 28:39.251
DANNY:
I don't know.

28:39.285 --> 28:40.486
Maybe Keenan went to meet Reid

28:40.519 --> 28:43.255
in one last-ditch effort to keep
himself from going belly-up.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.390
He sets a meeting
with Reid,

28:44.423 --> 28:45.992
tells him he's not going
to pay the bribe,

28:46.025 --> 28:49.195
Reid's not happy with it,
Keenan ends up dead.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.263
So why don't I play
like I'm a contractor?

28:51.297 --> 28:52.298
I'll call Reid, set
up an appointment,

28:52.331 --> 28:54.066
say I'm finishing
the Keenan job,

28:54.100 --> 28:55.935
I'll meet with Reid,
offer him a bribe.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.303
Sounds like a plan.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.938
All right.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.940
(applause)

29:00.973 --> 29:02.508
FRANK:
Every day, the men and women

29:02.541 --> 29:04.310
of the New York City
Police Department

29:04.343 --> 29:06.913
perform acts
both large and small

29:06.946 --> 29:10.316
that, as commissioner,
make me very proud.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.418
In the modern world,

29:12.451 --> 29:16.956
it's very difficult
to find certainty,

29:16.989 --> 29:19.458
but today, two things
are crystal clear.

29:19.491 --> 29:23.796
One-- six-month-old
Raymond Peter Lopez

29:23.830 --> 29:26.866
doesn't know how
to say thank you.

29:26.899 --> 29:30.536
The other certainty...

29:30.569 --> 29:34.006
is that little Raymond
wouldn't be here today

29:34.040 --> 29:36.008
if it wasn't for a hero.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.912
So I would like
to bring up

29:39.946 --> 29:43.249
Sergeant Anthony Renzulli.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.526
Thank you, Commissioner.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.395
You know, when I first
heard about this award

29:56.428 --> 30:00.332
I was thinking about what
it is that makes a hero,

30:00.366 --> 30:02.568
and I came up
with two things:

30:02.601 --> 30:04.503
bravery and luck.

30:04.536 --> 30:09.108
Not that I'm any braver
than any other cop in this room,

30:09.141 --> 30:13.479
but I'm luckier than most
because things turned out okay

30:13.512 --> 30:15.281
for me and this

30:15.314 --> 30:16.582
little boy
over here,

30:16.615 --> 30:19.018
and for that, I'm very grateful.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.455
Thank you.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.429
(no voice)

30:31.330 --> 30:33.565
(no voice)

30:53.152 --> 30:55.121
So we're good, right?

30:55.154 --> 30:57.356
At this time, the house
doesn't pass inspection.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.225
What do you mean?

30:59.258 --> 31:01.360
You got a loose
electrical outlet

31:01.393 --> 31:03.562
in the fourth-floor room,

31:03.595 --> 31:05.932
and there's extra rail space
on the basement steps.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.499
That's stuff I can
fix in five minutes,

31:07.533 --> 31:09.201
while you're still
standing here.

31:09.235 --> 31:12.238
Yeah, well, we'll have another
inspection in eight weeks.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.573
Eight weeks? Look, Mrs. Keenan
needs me to get the C of O.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.442
She's got to
sell this place

31:16.475 --> 31:18.444
and pay off the
bank, come on.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.646
Is there anything I can do
to make it worth your while

31:20.679 --> 31:22.081
to push this
thing along?

31:22.114 --> 31:25.317
I don't...
I don't know what you mean.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.488
A thousand dollars?

31:29.521 --> 31:31.623
$500 today,
$500 tomorrow?

31:31.657 --> 31:33.425
I don't push things along.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.394
That'd be against
Building Department policy,

31:35.427 --> 31:37.396
but I'll have a look
at the calendar

31:37.429 --> 31:40.632
to see if I can't find a more
agreeable date to come back.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.075
I can arrange
to come back tomorrow.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.577
If you fix the code violations
you'll have your C of O.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.212
Thanks.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.381
By the way,
you're under arrest for bribery.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.549
Son of a bitch.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.225
Get him the hell out of here.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.003
ERIN:
You have Reid on bribery.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.104
I know, but I was hoping

32:18.137 --> 32:20.339
you would help me get a
search warrant to his house.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.041
Why?

32:22.074 --> 32:25.311
You know, so I could look for
record of, uh, other bribes.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.013
Don't lie to me, Danny.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.514
What lie?
You want a search warrant

32:28.547 --> 32:31.050
to look for evidence of murder,
not for bribery.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.284
Look, are you trying to
protect Reid here?

32:32.318 --> 32:33.552
I'm not trying
to protect anyone.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.553
It's the law.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.123
You can't go into his home
and look for evidence

32:37.156 --> 32:38.024
that he killed Keenan.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.191
It won't hold up.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.359
Okay, so, as always,

32:40.392 --> 32:42.528
I stay within the strict
confines of the law.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.030
"As always"?
That's right.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.332
You better listen
to me on this.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.534
When do I ever
not listen to you?
(scoffs)

32:54.106 --> 32:55.241
Nolan.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.476
Hey.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.579
(clears throat)

33:00.612 --> 33:02.781
I've been looking
for you.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.051
I needed
to clear my head.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.185
By having a drink?

33:06.218 --> 33:07.619
Yeah.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.122
Today is opposite
day, isn't it?

33:10.156 --> 33:13.125
I pretend to be the hero,
and you pretend not to be.

33:13.159 --> 33:16.062
Maybe I'll get drunk
and pretend to be sober.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.299
You gave a nice speech.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.802
You know what the funny thing
about all this is, Reagan?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.238
The big lie we did,

33:26.272 --> 33:28.507
it not only got me
a lot of mileage at work,

33:28.540 --> 33:30.242
but all of a sudden,

33:30.276 --> 33:33.145
my wife thinks
I'm something special.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.284
I do, too.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.686
You did me a big favor.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.390
It wasn't easy,
and I appreciate it.

33:46.292 --> 33:49.395
So, how long is this undercover
going to go on for?

33:49.428 --> 33:52.198
Even if I knew, I
couldn't tell you.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.200
Oh, yeah?

33:58.104 --> 33:59.538
Just do me a favor.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.274
Don't do nothing heroic.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.178
Salud.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.214
Salud.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.785
Why am I not surprised

34:13.819 --> 34:15.254
that instead of evidence
of bribery,

34:15.287 --> 34:17.189
I have a pair of shoes?

34:17.223 --> 34:18.824
They were in plain view.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.025
You're so full of it.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.129
What happened to "working
within the confines of the law"?

34:23.162 --> 34:24.830
I did work within the
confines of the law.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.465
Look, the shoes were
sitting on the floor,

34:26.498 --> 34:28.534
right out in the open,
just staring up at me.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.702
Jackie?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.239
Plain view.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.174
We-we nearly tripped over them.

34:35.207 --> 34:37.576
See? Now, would you like
to hear the good news?

34:37.609 --> 34:39.478
Both the shoe size
and the wear pattern

34:39.511 --> 34:41.580
match the print that we found
on the chair seat

34:41.613 --> 34:43.649
that Keenan allegedly used
to hang himself.

34:43.682 --> 34:44.850
Is that all you got?

34:44.883 --> 34:47.319
Uh, Inspector Reid's
city-issued GPS

34:47.353 --> 34:49.388
puts him with Keenan
at the time of death.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.756
Have you interrogated him?

34:50.789 --> 34:52.491
No. He lawyered up.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.327
Well, it's still circumstantial,

34:55.361 --> 34:56.695
but it's enough
for a grand jury.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.397
Charge him with Murder Two.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.199
Start the process.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.501
And if I find out you
even asked him one question

35:02.534 --> 35:03.835
without that lawyer there,

35:03.869 --> 35:06.572
I will release him myself.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.175
You got it, sis.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.178
Thanks for sticking
by me on this one, partner.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.712
Yeah, no problem.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.215
Could you please stop starting
cases on our day off, though?

35:16.248 --> 35:18.784
I'll do my best.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.486
Stand up.

35:20.519 --> 35:21.920
Wh-What's going on?

35:21.953 --> 35:23.455
You're top charge
just became Murder Two.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.456
Get on your feet.

35:24.490 --> 35:25.757
You said I'd be out of here.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.259
You said the charge
was bribe receiving.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.126
Yeah well, now it's murder

35:28.160 --> 35:29.295
in the second degree;
will you get up?

35:29.328 --> 35:30.429
I-I didn't do it.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.164
We found your shoe
print on the chair

35:32.198 --> 35:33.565
and the GPS puts
you at the scene.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.267
That's right, now the lab's
running the rope for DNA,

35:35.301 --> 35:37.303
and I'm pretty sure yours
is gonna be on it; come on.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.370
It was an accident.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.272
Mr. Reid,
do not say another word.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.940
No, he-he's the one
that took a swing at me.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.742
Mr. Reid, I'm advising you
to stop talking.

35:43.775 --> 35:44.943
You're not
the one going to jail.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.578
Wait, wait. Wait.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.280
H-He was pissed,

35:48.314 --> 35:50.349
screaming about how
he's not going to pay a bribe.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.718
He started pushing me,
I pushed him back,

35:52.751 --> 35:54.653
and then he took a swing at me;
I panicked.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.322
I picked up a...

35:57.489 --> 36:00.526
I picked up a two-by-four,
and I-I swung it.

36:00.559 --> 36:01.827
It hit him in the head.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.895
I swear to God,
I didn't mean to kill him.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.331
It was an accident.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.468
Right, so you tried to make
it look like a suicide.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.340
Very clever.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.343
Only not clever enough for,
uh, Keenan's 11-year-old son.

36:17.376 --> 36:20.479
Come on. Think about him
while you rot in a cell.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.850
You were right,
you know.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.386
Your dad was just trying
to do the right thing.

36:27.419 --> 36:30.756
Is the guy that did it
going to go to jail?

36:30.789 --> 36:32.224
Oh, yeah.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.925
Yeah, for a long time.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.794
Good.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.430
Yeah, it is good.

36:38.464 --> 36:40.766
You know, I didn't know
your dad very well,

36:40.799 --> 36:43.435
but I got to talk to a lot of
people during my investigating.

36:43.469 --> 36:46.004
Got to thinking,

36:46.037 --> 36:49.007
it sounds like you two are a
lot alike, you and your dad.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.276
Why?

36:50.309 --> 36:51.710
Well, you're both brave,

36:51.743 --> 36:54.613
and you both fight for
what you believe in.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.282
Gotta tell you,

36:56.315 --> 36:57.883
I don't know too many
other 11-year-olds

36:57.916 --> 36:59.751
who would've had the guts
to have someone investigate

36:59.785 --> 37:01.620
their dad's death
the way you did.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.323
People say
I'm a pain sometimes.

37:04.356 --> 37:08.394
Yeah, well, they say that
about me a lot, too.

37:08.427 --> 37:11.463
Maybe that's what makes me a
decent detective, I don't know.

37:11.497 --> 37:12.964
You're a great detective.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.434
Ah, that almost makes
me want to forgive you

37:15.467 --> 37:17.002
for being an Islanders fan.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.539
By the way, you still
got those tickets?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.374
Yeah, why?

37:22.408 --> 37:24.376
Well, I was thinking
of taking you to the game.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.811
Really?

37:25.844 --> 37:27.979
Yeah, I'll pick you up
at 5:00, okay?

37:28.013 --> 37:30.382
Okay.
Yeah, right.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.650
Mr. Reagan?

37:33.018 --> 37:34.653
Thanks.

37:34.686 --> 37:35.921
You got it, kid.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.289
Thank you.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.396
Mac and cheese.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.564
This is great.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.533
None for you, though, Pop.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.501
Frankly, this entire meal

37:49.535 --> 37:51.337
is a heart attack
waiting to happen.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.404
Fried chicken,

37:52.438 --> 37:53.939
barbecued spare ribs,

37:53.972 --> 37:55.741
mac and cheese...

37:55.774 --> 37:58.076
All your favorites,
right, Jamie?

37:58.109 --> 38:00.946
Yeah, thanks, Erin.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.448
Now, I know I didn't miss

38:02.481 --> 38:03.649
your birthday.

38:03.682 --> 38:07.353
So, is this some
special occasion for Jamie?

38:07.386 --> 38:09.621
Why does it have to
be a special occasion

38:09.655 --> 38:12.558
for Erin to do something nice
for her brother?

38:12.591 --> 38:14.960
Because if it's
a special occasion,

38:14.993 --> 38:17.763
I get mac and cheese.

38:17.796 --> 38:18.764
Well, you know, Gramps,

38:18.797 --> 38:20.366
if you want something special
for yourself,

38:20.399 --> 38:21.800
all you got to do is ask.

38:21.833 --> 38:22.968
(chuckles)

38:23.001 --> 38:25.471
I know one person
who's celebrating tonight,

38:25.504 --> 38:28.507
and that is the mother of
that boy that Renzulli rescued.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.741
Yeah, that must've been
a great feeling,

38:29.775 --> 38:30.809
saving that little boy.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.612
Must've been.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.449
Well, I'm proud of my dad.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.551
You helped my
friend find out

38:39.585 --> 38:40.819
that his dad
didn't kill himself

38:40.852 --> 38:42.854
when no one else
believed him.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.390
We can celebrate that.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.057
Sure we can.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.693
Thanks.

38:48.894 --> 38:51.096
To my brothers.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.904
HENRY:
Slainte.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.985
So, how are you doing with this?

39:15.987 --> 39:17.889
I'm okay.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.563
That's a hard thing
for a man to do.

39:25.897 --> 39:29.635
It's almost like taking a
bullet for your partner.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.538
To me, he's the hero.

39:37.943 --> 39:41.413
There is no greater reward
than saving a life.

39:43.515 --> 39:46.084
That's something
you'll never forget.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.029
Well...

39:58.063 --> 40:01.166
I don't even want to think
about my day tomorrow.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.635
I'm going to bed.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.904
