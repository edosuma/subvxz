WEBVTT

00:59.625 --> 01:01.041
Gunther, Bola,

01:01.666 --> 01:04.666
thank you for joining us
here in our bubble.

01:04.750 --> 01:08.166
As the producer on this movie,
here's what I expect from you.

01:08.250 --> 01:11.041
-Actors are animals.

01:11.125 --> 01:14.041
You are animal handlers.

01:14.625 --> 01:18.708
Sometimes, they wanna play with you.
Sometimes, they'll rip your balls off.

01:19.583 --> 01:22.500
Don't listen
to anything they say. They're liars.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.875
They literally lie for a living.
That's their literal job, yeah?

01:26.625 --> 01:28.500
Don't party with them.

01:28.583 --> 01:30.666
Don't tire them out.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.250
Don't fuck them.

01:32.333 --> 01:33.166
I won't.

01:33.708 --> 01:36.791
Always tell them
they're fantastic in the movie.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.125
They're very insecure people.
They need constant praise.

01:41.208 --> 01:44.875
Make them feel good.
Don't tire them out. Don't fuck them.

01:44.958 --> 01:45.875
Don't fuck them.

01:45.958 --> 01:47.166
-That's it.
-That's it.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.708
Any questions?

01:48.791 --> 01:51.708
Um… Yeah, like,
what if we become proper friends?

01:51.791 --> 01:52.958
-You won't.
-No?

01:53.041 --> 01:53.958
No.

01:54.041 --> 01:55.458
What if they confide in you

01:55.541 --> 01:58.333
and tell you something
they've not told anybody else?

01:58.416 --> 02:00.125
Call me, tell me what they said.

02:00.208 --> 02:03.125
-What if they say, "Don't tell Gavin"?
-No!

02:03.208 --> 02:05.166
-No.
-This is the bubble.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.750
The sanctuary!

02:07.333 --> 02:11.875
It's the only place they're safe!
That's why you're not wearing masks.

02:11.958 --> 02:13.041
Don't you get it?

02:14.375 --> 02:15.708
-Hi!
-Hey!

02:15.791 --> 02:18.166
-How are you?
-So good to see you!

02:18.250 --> 02:19.458
-Uh…
-Oh…

02:19.541 --> 02:20.958
-Well, imagine…
-Okay, yes.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.500
-Fake hug.
-Oh, wow. You look fantastic!

02:23.583 --> 02:27.041
Thanks. Been exercising a lot.
It's the only thing keeping me sane.

02:27.125 --> 02:30.041
Well, you look sane and gorgeous, and, uh…

02:30.125 --> 02:34.083
-What do you think about <i>Cliff Beasts 6?</i>
-I can't leave my boyfriend right now.

02:34.166 --> 02:37.875
He is very neurotic, and this whole time
is just very triggering for him.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.041
Huh. Okay. What if you brought him?

02:40.125 --> 02:42.291
-He won't travel.
-Because of the pandemic?

02:42.375 --> 02:45.125
No, he just won't fly.
He also refuses to get a job.

02:45.208 --> 02:49.708
I have a lot of clients working in bubbles
right now, and they're having a blast.

02:49.791 --> 02:51.958
It won't be comfortable working with them.

02:52.041 --> 02:56.666
They hate me for not doing <i>Cliff Beasts 5.</i>
I can't bubble with them for three months.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.166
I'm gonna level with you.

02:58.250 --> 03:01.333
You need a rebound
after your last film, <i>Jerusalem Rising.</i>

03:01.416 --> 03:02.666
-Mm-hmm.
-You saw the reviews.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.791
-I never read my reviews.
-Hang on a sec.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.250
-Can you not read those?
-Just listen, okay?

03:07.333 --> 03:11.666
<i>"Jerusalem Rising</i> manages
to offend both Palestinians and Jews."

03:11.750 --> 03:15.500
That's one review.
And it was the script. It wasn't my fault.

03:15.583 --> 03:18.083
When <i>Cats</i> bombed,
they didn't blame Andrew Lloyd Webber.

03:18.166 --> 03:20.500
They just said, "Judi Dench fucked <i>Cats."</i>

03:20.583 --> 03:22.708
Okay, but you were the one who told me

03:22.791 --> 03:26.541
I could play half-Israeli
and half-Palestinian when I'm neither.

03:26.625 --> 03:29.958
I know you've
been fighting for thousands of years,

03:30.041 --> 03:34.583
but tonight,
we must join forces to fight the aliens.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.125
Is my career dead?

03:41.041 --> 03:42.416
Not if you make this movie.

03:43.958 --> 03:44.875
And it's safe?

03:44.958 --> 03:48.916
The safest place
in the world right now is a film set.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.583
The script is actually good?

03:50.666 --> 03:52.166
It made me cry.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.625
Oh, you're making the face
like you're gonna say yes.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.333
Oh, my God, Josh is gonna have
a full nervous breakdown.

04:03.416 --> 04:04.291
I can do this, right?

04:04.375 --> 04:07.041
I'll keep my head down,
not get pulled into the drama,

04:07.125 --> 04:09.750
and just do my job and get out.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.916
All right. Okay, let's do it.
Yeah, put me in the bubble.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.166
-Hi!
-<i>Carol. What's up, movie star?</i>

04:29.250 --> 04:31.625
This is so crazy.
You sure you're gonna be okay?

04:31.708 --> 04:35.166
<i>Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm just</i>
<i>worried about catching the virus, but…</i>

04:35.250 --> 04:37.125
Well, just call me regularly.

04:37.208 --> 04:41.000
<i>Actually, I just heard that veterinarians</i>
<i>are gonna start treating people,</i>

04:41.083 --> 04:42.750
<i>so that'll help.</i>

04:42.833 --> 04:45.791
Yeah, and it's only three months.
Three months! We can do this!

04:45.875 --> 04:47.416
Oh, wait! Somebody wants to say hi!

04:47.500 --> 04:48.416
Okay.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.041
Look who it is!

04:50.125 --> 04:51.916
I miss you so much, Mommy.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.750
Aw. I'm not your mommy yet, Leila,

04:53.833 --> 04:56.541
but I will be
your stepmom one day. It'll be the best!

04:56.625 --> 04:59.250
-Daddy said you left us for dead.
-Oh, what?

04:59.333 --> 05:02.500
-Don't forget about us! Bye!
-Bye!

05:11.125 --> 05:14.750
-Hey! Nice to meet you!
-Hiya! I'm Pippa, production coordinator.

05:14.833 --> 05:17.250
Oh. Shall we?
Welcome to Clifton House.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.208
-This is amazing.
-I know, right?

05:22.166 --> 05:26.833
-Carol, we're so excited you're here!
-I'm so excited to get started!

05:26.916 --> 05:29.125
-Wow! You look great.
-Oh, thank you.

05:29.208 --> 05:32.291
-Now, you just have to do a COVID test.
-Okay.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.750
-I'm such a big fan.
-Thank you.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.833
And in your nose. Okay.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.625
-Mm.
-Ready? One hundred.

05:40.125 --> 05:40.958
Ninety-nine.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.333
-Ninety-eight.
-Uh…

05:43.416 --> 05:44.500
-I'm only joking.
-Oh!

05:45.083 --> 05:48.541
-Oh, my God! You're the worst!
-See you in a bit. Bye, friend.

05:48.625 --> 05:49.958
Bye. Whoo! Yeah.

05:50.041 --> 05:52.458
Um, so how does the quarantining work?

05:52.541 --> 05:55.125
It's a quick 14 days. We pamper you.

05:55.208 --> 05:57.333
Wait till you see
what we've done to your room.

05:57.416 --> 05:59.916
-You have the best room by far.
-I love that.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.958
-Ah! Bola!
-Hello.

06:02.041 --> 06:06.625
This is Bola, our wellness specialist.
Bola, how would you describe yourself?

06:06.708 --> 06:11.500
Uh, well, due to safety, we don't have
a lot of staff, so I get to do everything.

06:11.583 --> 06:14.500
Which means if you need
a personal trainer, Bola.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.541
If you need a yoga teacher, Bola.

06:16.625 --> 06:20.041
If you need a ping-pong opponent, Bola.
If you need a masseuse?

06:20.125 --> 06:22.166
-Bola!
-That's it, baby girl.

06:22.666 --> 06:26.125
We allowed to smoke weed
in the room? I forgot to bring my edibles.

06:26.208 --> 06:28.375
Oh, my God! Howie, how are you?

06:28.458 --> 06:31.583
-Carol, come here, my love!
-Stop! That's it. Stop it!

06:31.666 --> 06:34.083
-Off you go.
-What the fuck is going on?

06:34.166 --> 06:35.666
-Brother, help me!
-Howie?

06:35.750 --> 06:39.125
Give it two weeks,
and you'll have all the hugs you need.

06:41.708 --> 06:43.041
Reception area.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.458
Now, this is beautiful.

06:45.541 --> 06:48.625
Of course! Top of the line
for top-of-the-line talent.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.541
There you are.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.791
This is nice!

06:54.666 --> 06:56.833
Good. See you in two weeks.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.166
-Oh.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.958
She loves you!
And you're the prime minister!

07:17.291 --> 07:18.666
<i>Am I your bitch now?</i>

07:19.583 --> 07:22.000
That's what you get
for fucking with her mission!

07:27.666 --> 07:31.375
This is too much
for anyone to take!

07:38.958 --> 07:40.375
Hey, Carol Cobb.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.625
Your quarantine is over.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.541
Uh, the cocktail party
starts in one hour, okay?

07:47.333 --> 07:49.125
Please shower before you come.

07:49.875 --> 07:51.791
It stinks in here.

07:52.416 --> 07:54.833
-Jesus Christ.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.541
-This is so exciting.
-Hmm.

08:09.333 --> 08:12.583
It's like my movie posters
have come to life.

08:13.791 --> 08:16.208
Yeah, you will soon learn
to hate these people.

08:16.291 --> 08:18.458
You abandoned us.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.833
I am mad at you. Back away.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.041
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.750
-Are you?
-I am.

08:25.833 --> 08:28.750
I should have done the movie.
I shouldn't have bailed.

08:28.833 --> 08:29.833
I'm an idiot.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.708
I missed you so much. I did.

08:32.791 --> 08:34.791
-You did?
-Yeah.

08:34.875 --> 08:36.708
Sorry. Had to get that off my chest.

08:36.791 --> 08:38.416
Yeah, give it to me.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.583
And I really liked you
in <i>Jerusalem Rising.</i>

08:42.250 --> 08:43.666
-Yeah.
-Really?

08:43.750 --> 08:46.000
That means so much coming from you.

08:46.083 --> 08:51.291
And I think that all of the critics
around the world are wrong.

08:51.375 --> 08:52.916
Oh, not everyone.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.791
Four percent on Rotten Tomatoes.

08:55.875 --> 08:58.625
It doesn't really go lower.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.750
So I need cool, documentary-style footage.

09:01.833 --> 09:06.125
If the actors ask for air, give them air,
but then strike and get what we need.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.083
I want you to be a fly on the wall,

09:08.166 --> 09:10.458
but also up their arse.

09:10.541 --> 09:13.166
-Now, fuck off, Lee.
-My name is Scott, actually.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.458
-I don't care.
-Okay.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.333
You a big <i>Cliff Beasts</i> fan?

09:17.416 --> 09:20.958
No, but I saw the trailer
for the second one. It was so cool!

09:21.625 --> 09:23.375
-Oh.
-Hey!

09:23.458 --> 09:24.750
Hi, y'all!

09:24.833 --> 09:26.166
Excited for <i>Cliff Beasts?</i>

09:26.250 --> 09:28.041
Is this the movie?

09:28.125 --> 09:29.333
What?

09:29.416 --> 09:31.083
Are we shooting right now?

09:31.166 --> 09:33.583
No, it's just behind-the-scenes stuff.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.875
Just say, like, a sentence
about why you're excited?

09:36.958 --> 09:40.666
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to talk
to my mom if you wanna talk to me.

09:40.750 --> 09:41.666
Oh, all right.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.791
-It's nice meeting you.
-Okay, you too.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.750
-Dieter! Hi!
-Hi.

09:48.458 --> 09:49.708
Lauren. Um…

09:49.791 --> 09:56.541
I just wanted to tell you
how incredible you were in <i>Hunger Strike.</i>

09:56.625 --> 09:57.875
Your performance was…

09:58.500 --> 10:03.541
I mean, I think about it all the time.
Just fearless and a total triumph.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.916
Um… Congratulations.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.375
I don't watch my own shit.
Never watch your own shit.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.791
You just wipe, you flush, and you move on.

10:10.875 --> 10:15.041
Right. Well, anyway, I just wanted to
let you know that it really stuck with me,

10:15.125 --> 10:17.625
and it was very powerful. Just…

10:17.708 --> 10:20.041
Yeah. Where's your husband?

10:20.125 --> 10:21.916
My husband? We got divorced.

10:22.000 --> 10:22.958
Of course.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.333
Mm-hmm. Uh--

10:24.416 --> 10:25.416
I'm sorry.

10:26.541 --> 10:28.333
No worries. It's… We're fine.

10:28.416 --> 10:31.083
We are, uh… totally fine.

10:31.166 --> 10:36.416
We have gone through a lot,
and we are coming out on the other side.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.333
Right.

10:37.416 --> 10:40.416
Our main priority is our 16-year-old son,

10:40.500 --> 10:44.000
who we just adopted
right before the divorce.

10:44.083 --> 10:47.166
Listen, I'm sorry,
I'm trying to care, but it's hard.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.166
Gunther, I like you.

10:49.833 --> 10:52.458
Really? I like you too.
I think you're… Okay, 'cause…

10:52.541 --> 10:53.500
That feels amazing,

10:53.583 --> 10:57.041
'cause we got told we weren't allowed
to be friends with the cast.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.666
Who said that?

10:58.750 --> 11:02.500
I don't wanna be a person that's like,
"It was Gavin," but, yeah.

11:02.583 --> 11:04.125
Know how I feel about that?

11:04.208 --> 11:05.791
-Fuck you, Gavin!
-Do you?

11:05.875 --> 11:08.125
Suck your mum, Gavin!
Say it from your chest.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.208
What? Fuck you, Gavin!

11:10.291 --> 11:13.750
I need to be real with you.
I don't understand these bullshit rules.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.625
Been in my room two weeks.
I ain't had human contact.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.875
It's important
for my mental and physical health

11:18.958 --> 11:20.708
to have human contact with friends.

11:20.791 --> 11:22.208
-We're friends!
-Completely.

11:22.291 --> 11:25.333
-What will happen if I touch you? Huh?
-We could die.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.583
Yeah, completely.
It's kind of the situation.

11:27.666 --> 11:28.666
-Yeah.
-Boop!

11:28.750 --> 11:31.333
-Um--
-Did we die? Are you dead?

11:31.416 --> 11:34.958
You've just got to understand
that my job, as a health officer,

11:35.041 --> 11:39.083
is to make sure that everything
that we're doing is as safe as possible.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.416
All the best, Gunther.

11:43.583 --> 11:46.333
-Um, my dad does stunts.
-Hi.

11:46.416 --> 11:49.666
Um, I'm lonely, and I'm in hell here,

11:49.750 --> 11:52.791
and I would like
to form an alliance with you.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.833
Okay, yeah, sure.

11:57.708 --> 11:58.833
All right, okay.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.375
It was hard
doing the last one without you.

12:02.458 --> 12:05.708
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.
I got really bad advice from my reps

12:05.791 --> 12:08.125
and was also having some,
ahem, emotional issues.

12:08.208 --> 12:11.541
That's where you were on your journey,
and it brought you right back here.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.291
-Exactly.
-It's all good.

12:13.375 --> 12:17.333
-I heard you were starting a religion.
-No, it's a…

12:17.416 --> 12:19.666
It's a lifestyle brand
slash motivational system

12:19.750 --> 12:21.000
called Harmony Ignite.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.541
Wow. And you wrote a whole Bible.

12:23.625 --> 12:26.458
Well, I wrote a book.
A book called <i>Harmony Ignited.</i>

12:26.541 --> 12:29.791
And, uh, it's just a collection
of my thoughts and musings

12:29.875 --> 12:33.791
and some sayings and wisdom and proverbs.
That's it, yeah.

12:33.875 --> 12:38.125
It's not a religion, per se.
You can leave anytime that you want to.

12:38.208 --> 12:41.250
-It's not, like, a cult.
-No, it's definitely not a cult.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.166
I mean, who defines what a cult is?

12:43.250 --> 12:44.541
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:44.625 --> 12:48.500
You know what? I'm gonna be
really straightforward with you right now

12:48.583 --> 12:53.041
and let you know that we are
co-parents to Raphael, and that is it.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.000
That's true.

12:54.083 --> 12:59.166
So what happened on parts one
and three and four is not happening again.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.333
What about what we did on part two?

13:02.416 --> 13:03.791
You have no respect for me.

13:03.875 --> 13:05.875
I have nothing but respect for you.

13:07.291 --> 13:08.166
Stop.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.500
Stop.

13:10.583 --> 13:13.041
-Stop it.
-Stop.

13:13.666 --> 13:16.083
I would appreciate
if you didn't look at me like that.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.333
-Where should I look?
-I can't look at you.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.541
-I'm still here though.

13:22.625 --> 13:23.791
I know you.

13:23.875 --> 13:24.916
-God. Hi.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.625
-How are you doing? Sorry to scare you.
-Don't worry.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.916
I am so excited that you are here.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.125
Oh, yeah. No, I'm so excited.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.208
Gotta tell you, I love the TikTok stuff.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.041
You are crushing it.
Absolutely crushing it.

13:37.125 --> 13:40.666
I mean, clearly. 120 million followers.
You are unbelievable.

13:40.750 --> 13:44.083
I love the one where you
and your cat lip-synch to <i>Harry Potter.</i>

13:44.166 --> 13:46.125
I can't believe you've seen all that.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.625
It's fantastic!

13:47.708 --> 13:50.958
Hey, maybe you and I can do
one together while we're here.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.541
-Oh, yeah, maybe.
-Yeah.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.916
-What's your name?
-Carla.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.666
Nice to meet you.
You got great energy about you.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.333
Gavs!

14:01.791 --> 14:02.708
Who is that?

14:03.416 --> 14:05.791
One of the actors.
He's not that good though.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.375
-May I refresh your water?

14:09.750 --> 14:11.458
Yeah, please.

14:12.583 --> 14:13.833
Thanks.

14:13.916 --> 14:16.166
Why you look at me
with weird eyes?

14:23.208 --> 14:25.541
-Jesus fucking Christ.
-Wow.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.375
-Hey!
-Hey!

14:28.458 --> 14:30.125
-Okay.
-Hit us with it, Gav.

14:30.208 --> 14:34.416
Welcome! I'm gonna introduce
somebody now who is…

14:35.333 --> 14:36.708
He's special.

14:38.958 --> 14:40.333
He's funny.

14:40.416 --> 14:42.625
He's extremely intelligent.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.833
And he's a…

14:46.333 --> 14:47.583
He's a visionary.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.916
He shot a brilliant movie called
<i>Tiles of Love</i>

14:52.000 --> 14:53.875
while working at Home Depot.

14:54.625 --> 14:59.750
-Our director… Darren Eigen!

14:59.833 --> 15:03.541
-Whoo!
-Thank you! Thanks, you guys. Uh…

15:03.625 --> 15:04.916
I just wanna say

15:05.000 --> 15:09.166
I am so lucky to be able
to work with a cast this talented.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.875
This is your car,

15:12.083 --> 15:15.041
and I'm gonna step in and take the wheel.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.666
This drive is gonna be a little crazy.

15:18.666 --> 15:21.541
Gonna head towards the railing
a couple of times. Might hit it.

15:22.291 --> 15:24.375
Some of you might not even survive.

15:24.958 --> 15:29.083
But I've got the end of the road
in my sight.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.750
Might be a crazy ride,

15:33.458 --> 15:35.625
but it's gonna look great,

15:36.333 --> 15:39.541
and it's gonna
make the world forget all their problems.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.000
So,

15:42.833 --> 15:43.833
let's go for a ride.

15:44.458 --> 15:45.458
We're fucked.

15:48.666 --> 15:49.958
Are you sure it's safe?

15:50.041 --> 15:52.750
Just don't put your hands
too close to your face.

15:52.833 --> 15:55.666
-Oh, shit. Aah!

15:55.750 --> 15:57.416
No! No! No!

15:57.500 --> 16:00.666
-Grab. Nice. Right arm. Block.

16:01.750 --> 16:06.291
Move around. Good. Let me hear the rage.
Aah. Spins around, kick. Great.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.000
Get him, boy. Get him!

16:11.375 --> 16:12.958
Heart shot! Yeah!

16:13.041 --> 16:14.083
Dick shot!

16:14.166 --> 16:15.000
Over.

16:15.833 --> 16:16.666
Pow.

16:17.666 --> 16:19.958
Oi! And roll.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.083
Rusty, come! Come on, boy!

16:30.166 --> 16:33.250
Can you train him
to peck off Dustin's balls?

16:35.416 --> 16:36.416
I'm just kidding.

16:37.166 --> 16:39.166
But can you?

17:29.500 --> 17:31.083
<i>Gavin, how are you?</i>

17:31.166 --> 17:34.333
Hi! How are you doing?

17:34.416 --> 17:37.750
<i>Oh, good. I just wanted</i>
<i>to say, uh, good luck,</i>

17:37.833 --> 17:40.166
<i>and we love you,</i>
<i>and we're counting on you.</i>

17:40.250 --> 17:41.666
I know. I'm on it.

17:41.750 --> 17:45.541
<i>You are such a hero</i>
<i>for keeping the lights on at the studio.</i>

17:45.625 --> 17:49.708
<i>This lockdown has been</i>
<i>so hard on all of us.</i>

17:49.791 --> 17:51.416
But you're skiing?

17:51.500 --> 17:55.333
<i>Yeah, well, this was the only country</i>
<i>that was open. Thank God I got my shot.</i>

17:55.416 --> 17:58.541
Did you? I thought
they weren't available for six months.

17:58.625 --> 18:01.916
<i>Oh, they're not. Not for normal people,</i>
<i>but I'm with rich people.</i>

18:02.541 --> 18:05.750
<i>Don't hate the player,</i>
<i>hate the game. Ugh! I hate the game.</i>

18:05.833 --> 18:08.541
<i>Anyway, have a great shoot.</i>

18:08.625 --> 18:11.041
<i>I love you. I'm in love with you.</i>

18:11.125 --> 18:14.250
<i>And do not fuck me!</i>

18:14.333 --> 18:17.250
So the thing
about Harmony Ignite is it's about dreams.

18:17.333 --> 18:20.625
It's about
how you go about fulfilling your dreams.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.333
I'm not really looking for a new religion.

18:23.416 --> 18:25.458
I'm Hindu. Many gods, very busy.

18:25.541 --> 18:27.708
-I have a question for you, man.
-Mm-hmm.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.250
-What's your dream?
-My dream?

18:30.333 --> 18:31.750
Your dream. I wanna hear it.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.083
This won't be the last pandemic.
We all know that.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.375
-Absolutely.
-We still need to have sex.

18:38.458 --> 18:41.666
My brother, a software engineer in India,
has invented a glove.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.291
It's like a hand
that you can wrap around you

18:44.375 --> 18:46.833
or put inside you, anally.

18:46.916 --> 18:50.250
Then somewhere, in a different city,
somebody else has the hand,

18:50.333 --> 18:55.041
and then they do things to the hand
that you feel on you or inside you.

18:55.125 --> 18:59.000
You're safe. It's sanitary ecstasy.
You'll be wearing virtual reality goggles,

18:59.083 --> 19:02.416
so you can have sex
anywhere in the world with anyone.

19:03.875 --> 19:06.875
Well, thank you for coming
to pick up my tray. Appreciate it.

19:07.541 --> 19:09.375
Oh, no. Sure, yeah. Uh…

19:10.083 --> 19:10.916
This was…

19:11.416 --> 19:12.541
If you get lonely…

19:16.125 --> 19:17.000
Anika.

19:17.083 --> 19:17.958
Hi.

19:18.666 --> 19:20.375
I was wondering if you could help.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.083
With what?

19:22.166 --> 19:23.583
You wanna have sex with me?

19:23.666 --> 19:25.000
Yes, I do!

19:25.083 --> 19:26.541
-Amazing.

19:26.625 --> 19:27.458
Not now.

19:28.541 --> 19:29.375
When?

19:29.458 --> 19:32.583
When I get to know you,
because I like you.

19:32.666 --> 19:35.500
-Great.
-Then I would like you to meet my father.

19:36.083 --> 19:39.375
And if you get his permission,
you will sign a lifelong agreement

19:39.458 --> 19:41.166
because I am a pure angel,

19:41.250 --> 19:43.708
and you won't come across
someone like me again.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.208
Okay, hi, guys!

19:57.291 --> 20:01.500
Yeah, let's talk about zones for a moment.
Uh, there are three main ones, okay?

20:01.583 --> 20:05.166
There's Red Zone. That's the best zone.
That's the actors, okay?

20:05.250 --> 20:07.791
Then there's Blue Zone. That's for crew.

20:07.875 --> 20:12.083
Then there's Yellow Zone for office staff.
We don't need to worry about that.

20:12.166 --> 20:14.916
Um, a lot of you
have been asking about flirting.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.500
Yes, it happens. Um, physical touch is,
of course, off the table.

20:18.583 --> 20:22.333
Um, so what I would recommend
is making sweet eyes at each other.

20:22.416 --> 20:25.875
Um, if you're wondering
what that looks like, that'd be…

20:27.125 --> 20:29.750
Mm.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.041
Wha…

20:35.750 --> 20:36.625
Oh.

20:37.833 --> 20:38.750
Mm.

20:39.416 --> 20:40.833
Are there any questions?

20:42.208 --> 20:44.791
Amazing! Let's have some fun.

20:49.583 --> 20:54.166
So, uh, Gio, this is
your first expedition up Mount Everest?

20:54.250 --> 20:57.083
Yes, but, uh, it is not news to me

20:57.166 --> 21:00.541
that Modelcorp is lucky
to have hired all of you

21:00.625 --> 21:05.000
to make sure all the creatures
of this land are respected

21:06.041 --> 21:07.250
and honored.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.750
It's not a creature.

21:09.333 --> 21:13.666
What we hear from the locals,
we may be dealing with a cliff beast.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.625
Climate change has melted
the whole top of the mountain.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.916
It's a burnt wasteland.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.750
The beast must have
come out of the melted permafrost.

21:24.875 --> 21:28.541
Global warming, my ass! Who did this?

21:28.625 --> 21:29.833
Uh, man.

21:31.125 --> 21:32.166
And wo-man.

21:32.250 --> 21:36.333
One thing I've learned growing up
in the mossy savannas of Alabama

21:36.416 --> 21:38.416
is if you've seen one June bug,

21:39.208 --> 21:41.958
there's more than likely
500 more waiting in the wings.

21:42.041 --> 21:45.250
-We've seen this before.
-Five times is what I have heard.

21:47.041 --> 21:50.208
Why are we going towards the dinosaurs?
That's where the danger is!

21:52.500 --> 21:56.333
Oh, no. That sounds like a baby
crying for its mama.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.291
That ain't no baby!

22:02.375 --> 22:04.000
My God, what are we gonna do?

22:09.458 --> 22:10.875
Somebody help him!

22:10.958 --> 22:11.875
Drop him!

22:16.125 --> 22:17.166
Hang in there!

22:17.250 --> 22:19.666
How does he fly? He has no feathers!

22:19.750 --> 22:21.958
Well, somebody taught him how to fly!

22:22.875 --> 22:23.708
Please stop!

22:24.708 --> 22:25.916
It's okay. I got him!

22:34.208 --> 22:35.708
All right, cut!

22:36.291 --> 22:37.875
-Great work.

22:37.958 --> 22:39.958
-That was a great take.
-Moving on.

22:40.041 --> 22:41.541
-Oh, um, Sean?
-Yeah?

22:41.625 --> 22:44.916
Did you have a chance
to read the screenplay I sent you?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.958
Oh. They're bringing me down.
I'm sorry, buddy.

22:49.041 --> 22:51.750
-Oh, I can still hear you.
-One second. Getting unplugged.

22:51.833 --> 22:54.333
Darren, one note before we move on?

22:54.416 --> 22:57.500
I don't get when Dolly says,
"Somebody taught him how to fly."

22:57.583 --> 23:01.416
They're cliff beasts. It's in their DNA.
That's what they do. They fly.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.916
You can't rewrite my lines.
You're not the writer.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.833
But it goes against dinosaur logic.

23:05.916 --> 23:09.875
Why are you rewriting the script?
We have a writer. Aren't you an actor?

23:09.958 --> 23:12.791
Yes, but I'm also
the guardian of the franchise.

23:12.875 --> 23:15.041
-So I'm rewriting it.
-We have somebody.

23:15.125 --> 23:17.333
Can we play
to the top of our audience's intelligence?

23:17.416 --> 23:20.625
No, our audience is down here.
They're kids. That's our audience.

23:20.708 --> 23:24.625
Don't listen to him. He doesn't want me
to have the big crowd-applause line.

23:24.708 --> 23:27.750
Lauren, all of your lines
will be big applause lines

23:27.833 --> 23:29.583
if movie theaters ever open again.

23:29.666 --> 23:31.458
Carol hates the writing too.

23:31.541 --> 23:32.958
What? Carol?

23:33.041 --> 23:35.333
Lauren, that was private!

23:35.416 --> 23:37.333
Plus, I also didn't say it.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.041
That is exactly why I asked them
not to bring you back after you bailed.

23:41.125 --> 23:43.791
-I didn't bail. Am I getting coffee?
-Mm-hmm.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.166
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-What are you doing?

23:47.250 --> 23:49.166
Covering your mic so people can't hear us.

23:50.166 --> 23:53.375
I know. I do feel like
my dialogue is a little lackluster.

23:53.458 --> 23:55.958
So let me fix it. Let me punch it up.

23:56.041 --> 23:58.166
-Can you do that?
-I can punch it up.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.666
Let me take care of you.

24:00.541 --> 24:02.125
How are you gonna take care of me?

24:02.208 --> 24:04.708
Well, I'm gonna start dialogue-wise,

24:04.791 --> 24:07.750
and then, you know,
move on from there, I guess?

24:07.833 --> 24:10.958
-You're gonna… punch me up?
-Oh, yeah.

24:13.291 --> 24:17.625
Guys, if you make any changes
to the script, can you just cc me on it?

24:17.708 --> 24:18.708
At least?

24:19.291 --> 24:22.916
"Guardian of the franchise"?
Assholes. I won Sundance!

24:23.000 --> 24:26.875
-What's the point of us being up here?
-Eyelines. So they know where to look.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.333
Pretty cool.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.333
And you and you.

24:54.541 --> 24:56.458
-What's this?
-What's the next bit?

24:56.541 --> 24:59.291
Hey, guys. Just listen up for a second.

24:59.375 --> 25:00.750
Um…

25:00.833 --> 25:03.125
We have had a situation on set

25:04.166 --> 25:07.666
that means
we're going to shut down production

25:07.750 --> 25:09.416
and go back into quarantine.

25:11.666 --> 25:13.041
That's not even funny.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.000
Screw you, Gavin. That's hilarious, man.

25:17.083 --> 25:22.833
I wish I was joking, but I'm not.
You all have to go back to your rooms.

25:22.916 --> 25:23.750
No!

25:23.833 --> 25:26.125
We had a positive test on set,

25:26.208 --> 25:29.416
and although I am forbidden
from telling you who it was,

25:29.500 --> 25:32.041
let's just say it's the girl
who gets your coffees.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.625
Um, her name's Wendy.

25:33.708 --> 25:34.916
That creepy PA?

25:35.000 --> 25:39.125
Yeah, production were trying to be safe
by sending one person to get the coffees,

25:39.208 --> 25:43.583
when in fact that led to Wendy touching
about 80 coffee cups this morning.

25:43.666 --> 25:45.166
We're gonna die.

25:45.250 --> 25:48.375
-No, we're not gonna die! Howie.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.166
Is this how it always goes?

25:50.250 --> 25:52.375
No, this is a shit show.

25:52.458 --> 25:55.208
-Guys, calm down!
-Oi!

25:55.291 --> 25:58.375
I am a mother,
so I have to go!

25:59.583 --> 26:01.333
Or I need a larger room.

26:01.416 --> 26:03.875
If I could just switch rooms with Howie,

26:03.958 --> 26:07.791
because he has the tub,
and I have only a shower!

26:07.875 --> 26:09.791
Yeah, but in Pakistan,
you ain't shit!

26:09.875 --> 26:14.916
Okay, guys, listen, okay?
I have had the virus three times, okay?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.375
And the first time,
I didn't even notice it.

26:17.458 --> 26:19.208
Second time, was in a coma.

26:19.291 --> 26:22.166
The third time, I lost
my sense of sort of taste and smell

26:22.250 --> 26:23.666
and how I felt about people.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.208
Trust me, that is something
that you want to avoid.

26:26.291 --> 26:27.541
I think he's still sick.

26:27.625 --> 26:29.166
I can't wear rings anymore

26:29.250 --> 26:32.125
because my fingers
change size every single day.

26:32.208 --> 26:35.750
I can't do this, man. I can't stay
in my room any longer on my own.

26:35.833 --> 26:37.583
If you make me, I'll fuck my chair!

26:37.666 --> 26:40.416
No. Look, guys, we're here for you.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.875
So don't worry.
Once you're all back in your rooms,

26:44.375 --> 26:46.208
we're gonna take great care of you.

26:46.291 --> 26:48.041
You have to go into your room too.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.166
-Why?
-You had a latte.

26:50.666 --> 26:52.625
-Oh, fuck!
-I know.

26:52.708 --> 26:55.083
So how are you feeling
about the new quarantine?

26:55.166 --> 26:57.041
-Really? Really?

26:57.125 --> 26:59.250
-Sorry, when would be a good time--
-Never.

26:59.333 --> 27:00.333
-Fuck off!
-Perfect.

27:00.416 --> 27:02.750
It's ten seconds and we're done.
Are you ready?

27:02.833 --> 27:05.125
Yeah, let's go. Let's go.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.708
Fuck you! Fuck you, you fucking bastard!

27:09.791 --> 27:12.625
I'm gonna kill you,
and then I'm gonna murder your ghost!

27:13.791 --> 27:15.125
That was not too bad.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.250
You okay?

27:25.250 --> 27:26.416
-I'm sorry.
-I'll wait.

27:28.166 --> 27:31.416
-That's a little too deep.
-It's better that way. I think…

27:34.791 --> 27:37.625
-Are you… Excuse me, are you all right?
-Yes. Yeah, yeah.

27:48.458 --> 27:52.416
Fuck you! You're not gonna win!
I am gonna win, you motherfucker!

27:52.500 --> 27:56.166
"How many species have died
because of man? Thousands!"

27:56.250 --> 27:58.458
"I think it's snack time. For them."

27:58.541 --> 28:02.166
"These cliff beasts
are so large! How do they fly?"

28:02.250 --> 28:03.458
"How? How?"

28:03.541 --> 28:05.166
"How do they fly?"

28:05.250 --> 28:06.833
"There's nothing left to eat but us."

28:09.333 --> 28:11.666
"These cliff beasts are so large!"

28:11.750 --> 28:14.958
Sound idea for a cliff beast.
Here's beast one.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.500
Swooping down.

28:22.458 --> 28:23.291
Mating.

28:26.708 --> 28:28.458
Mourning the loss of a child.

28:32.375 --> 28:33.666
Full rage.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.958
Mother, I can't do 13 more days of this!

28:40.041 --> 28:42.791
I've already been doing this for 12 hours.
It's too much!

28:42.875 --> 28:44.625
<i>Hey, guys, it's Krystal.</i>

28:44.708 --> 28:47.041
<i>Um, I'm back in quarantine in my room.</i>

28:47.125 --> 28:49.458
<i>I'm gonna need a lot of movie suggestions,</i>

28:49.541 --> 28:51.958
<i>but I wanna watch more, like, dark stuff.</i>

28:52.041 --> 28:55.375
<i>Everyone told me to watch</i>
<i>this movie,</i> E.T.? <i>Felt a little racist.</i>

28:55.458 --> 28:57.958
<i>I don't wanna watch anything</i>
<i>that'd offend my fans.</i>

28:58.041 --> 29:00.541
<i>I have respect</i>
<i>for everybody that follows me.</i>

29:00.625 --> 29:03.541
Sean, you are not
in competition with Krystal.

29:03.625 --> 29:07.958
You are not aging.
You don't need 100 million followers.

29:09.083 --> 29:10.166
I am titanium!

29:10.250 --> 29:12.083
I am invincible! Age is an illusion!

29:12.166 --> 29:13.833
Time cannot catch me! Never die!

29:26.833 --> 29:28.791
<i>I need weed immediately!</i>
<i>Buy a drone.</i>

29:28.875 --> 29:32.708
Attach my marijuana to the drone.
Fly that shit through my fucking window!

29:32.791 --> 29:37.583
"I just want a safe place
for the dinosaurs to live!"

29:55.333 --> 29:57.666
I really couldn't do this without you.

29:57.750 --> 30:02.166
I probably could do it without you,
but that's just because I'm used to it.

30:02.250 --> 30:05.166
This is the first time I've left Indiana.

30:05.250 --> 30:08.166
So did you, like,
audition for the movie or what?

30:08.250 --> 30:12.083
I think they just jammed me in this movie
because I have a lot of followers.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.958
Must be fun having 100 million followers.

30:15.041 --> 30:16.875
Sometimes I just want a break,

30:16.958 --> 30:21.041
but my mom just tells me
if I don't keep putting out content,

30:21.125 --> 30:23.750
then everybody's just gonna
forget about me, so…

30:23.833 --> 30:26.291
I can help you if you want.

30:26.791 --> 30:30.000
You know, I've never had a normal friend.

30:31.166 --> 30:33.500
No one's ever called me normal before.

30:35.541 --> 30:36.833
Why are you laughing?

30:38.250 --> 30:39.958
You're such a freak.

30:41.833 --> 30:44.541
Whoo! I'm doing it, son!

30:46.625 --> 30:47.916
This is awesome!

30:48.875 --> 30:50.458
Gavin, buddy, can you hear me?

30:50.541 --> 30:51.583
Yeah.

30:51.666 --> 30:54.000
This is all I'm doing? I'm just going up?

30:54.083 --> 30:57.500
You're only allowed to learn how to go up.

30:57.583 --> 31:00.041
That's all we need
for the shot in the movie.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.625
If I can go forward
just even a little bit,

31:02.708 --> 31:05.500
my fans, they will shit their dicks.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.875
Gavin, is this safe? Why is he doing this?

31:07.958 --> 31:11.125
He wouldn't do the movie
unless we let him do this.

31:11.208 --> 31:15.625
How exciting is it to direct a movie
with a $100 million budget?

31:15.708 --> 31:16.875
It's a lot of pressure.

31:16.958 --> 31:20.500
Well, it would be a lot of pressure
if the cast wasn't so brilliant.

31:20.583 --> 31:21.708
See you later, buddy.

31:21.791 --> 31:24.541
Are you worried people
won't watch a movie about dinosaurs,

31:24.625 --> 31:27.000
given the serious nature
of the global pandemic?

31:27.083 --> 31:29.333
Hey, are you being a fly on the wall?

31:30.000 --> 31:34.125
You're a pretty noisy fucking fly!
I can hardly hear the helicopter!

31:34.208 --> 31:35.583
Sorry, just doing my job.

31:35.666 --> 31:39.125
What job is that?
Trying to get in my fucking head?

31:39.625 --> 31:41.000
Like he wants me to fail!

31:41.083 --> 31:44.791
Don't let him mess with your focus.
Everybody wants you to fail.

31:44.875 --> 31:46.833
Don't give a fuck about him.

31:46.916 --> 31:48.208
What?

31:53.541 --> 31:56.625
-Where's Ronjon?
-You asked for a tray table to be removed.

31:56.708 --> 31:57.958
I said send Ronjon.

31:58.041 --> 32:01.625
You wanted sex, but you will get love.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Hold on.

32:16.708 --> 32:18.500
Isn't that nice?

32:19.708 --> 32:20.916
You don't know me!

32:25.291 --> 32:28.208
Am I a great director?

32:29.583 --> 32:31.208
Yes, of course you are.

32:31.291 --> 32:32.791
You have a vision.

32:32.875 --> 32:34.583
-Yeah, I think I do.
-Yeah.

32:34.666 --> 32:38.083
So what do I do when Dustin
keeps trying to rewrite the script?

32:38.166 --> 32:42.958
When he tells you his ideas,
tell him you'll think about them,

32:43.458 --> 32:45.125
and then never get back to him.

32:45.208 --> 32:46.625
You do that to me.

32:46.708 --> 32:48.750
No, with you, I'm actually thinking.

32:51.750 --> 32:53.166
I'm just playing around.

32:54.291 --> 32:55.666
Making movies is fun!

32:57.833 --> 32:59.291
That's why we do it!

32:59.375 --> 33:03.958
I'm sorry I skipped your mom's funeral
to go to the People's Choice Awards.

33:04.041 --> 33:06.875
I'm sorry that I

33:07.791 --> 33:09.833
burned down your back office.

33:09.916 --> 33:12.041
I'm sorry I slept with your agent.

33:13.875 --> 33:15.500
-Sorry that--
-And your manager.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.541
And your divorce lawyer.

33:18.625 --> 33:20.833
-Yeah.
-Uh…

33:20.916 --> 33:23.083
I'm sorry I gave up on us.

33:23.666 --> 33:25.875
Why is it always so hard?

33:25.958 --> 33:31.708
I think 'cause you're so strong.
You're so intimidating. So talented.

33:31.791 --> 33:33.125
Hmm.

33:33.208 --> 33:37.000
I feel like nobody would be able
to fix the script the way you do

33:37.833 --> 33:42.416
and stay in such incredible shape.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.541
And you

33:44.666 --> 33:46.125
are an amazing mother.

33:48.708 --> 33:52.000
-Take me to the peak!
-We are on a mountain!

33:52.083 --> 33:55.125
Mount Everest!

33:55.208 --> 33:57.916
-Ooh. I think I see one of the crew.
-Oh, shit. Get…

33:59.208 --> 34:03.458
<i>Uh, so how</i>
<i>is the major motion picture going?</i>

34:03.541 --> 34:06.125
It's fine. Everybody's just old.

34:06.208 --> 34:07.916
<i>Is there somebody cute there?</i>

34:08.000 --> 34:10.250
<i>-Who you maybe wanna smooch with?</i>

34:11.333 --> 34:13.791
Don't be gross, Mom! God!

34:13.875 --> 34:17.458
<i>Is Timmy-thee Oilyphant there? Oh.</i>

34:17.541 --> 34:19.250
-No!
<i>-I could…</i>

34:19.333 --> 34:22.333
Why are you saying it like that?
That's not his name!

34:22.416 --> 34:25.250
But I wish he was here.
I do. He's very cute.

34:25.333 --> 34:29.083
<i>Oh. Are you nervous</i>
<i>to meet the dinosaurs during your act?</i>

34:29.166 --> 34:31.208
Mom, they're not real!

34:31.291 --> 34:33.666
They, like… They put them in after.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.875
<i>I thought there was an elephant</i>
<i>wearing a mask or something.</i>

34:36.958 --> 34:39.208
I wish you were here. I'm so lonely.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.291
<i>Aww!</i>

34:55.250 --> 34:57.666
Come on!

35:13.458 --> 35:16.625
-Oh! Jesus!
-You okay?

35:16.708 --> 35:18.125
-I'm fine!
-Let me check.

35:18.208 --> 35:20.041
-Hey, whoa, social distancing.
-Sorry.

35:20.666 --> 35:22.666
Why are you kicking balls around?

35:22.750 --> 35:26.041
Uh, I'm with my squad.
We're just bubbling before the big game.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.458
-A game? What kind of a game?
-Football.

35:28.541 --> 35:30.833
Soccer. I play for Betis.

35:31.583 --> 35:34.541
Oh. I didn't realize
anybody else was in this hotel.

35:34.625 --> 35:35.583
Well, we are.

35:36.375 --> 35:39.666
Well, I'm bubbling too. I'm an actress,
and we're making a movie.

35:41.041 --> 35:41.875
I know you.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.666
<i>Cliff Beasts.</i>

35:44.250 --> 35:46.416
Dr. Lacie.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.041
Yes, that's me, Dr. Lacie.

35:48.625 --> 35:50.541
You're in <i>Jerusalem Rising</i> too, right?

35:50.625 --> 35:52.750
-Yes.
-I have to ask.

35:52.833 --> 35:55.375
Are you half-Palestinian, half-Israeli?

35:55.458 --> 35:57.208
Actually, I'm not either.

35:57.875 --> 35:59.125
Great acting.

35:59.208 --> 36:02.291
Ah! That's so good to hear.
So many people got mad at me.

36:02.375 --> 36:06.125
Everyone was offended. I was like,
"I'm just trying to create a piece of art

36:06.208 --> 36:08.666
that might help solve the issues."

36:08.750 --> 36:09.666
Peace.

36:10.958 --> 36:15.458
Well, Lacie, would you like to, uh, go to
my room right now and just talk for a bit?

36:17.333 --> 36:18.958
-I'd like to talk.
-Yeah, me too.

36:19.041 --> 36:21.458
I feel like I haven't talked
in a very long time.

36:22.125 --> 36:24.125
I'm a lot of fun to talk to.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.375
I've just been talking to myself lately.

36:27.458 --> 36:30.875
If I don't talk to you,
I think I'm going to explode.

36:30.958 --> 36:33.500
But I don't think
we're allowed to cross bubbles.

36:33.583 --> 36:35.791
No, we wouldn't be crossing bubbles.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.083
We'd be making a new bubble.

36:38.708 --> 36:41.041
Then we're just inside
each other's bubbles.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.750
No. No, no, no. No, we can't.
Stop it. Stop it.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.000
Goodbye, Dr. Lacie.

36:53.958 --> 36:57.791
-Hello, friends. Good morning.

36:57.875 --> 37:01.416
Thank you all
for joining our morning meditation.

37:01.500 --> 37:07.625
This is our opportunity to breathe,
let go of our troubles, and recharge.

37:07.708 --> 37:08.750
Yeah.

37:08.833 --> 37:11.250
I want you to close your eyes.

37:12.041 --> 37:15.041
-Let the air fill your lungs…

37:16.291 --> 37:21.041
…and release the fear
of catching the virus.

37:21.708 --> 37:25.541
And release the fear
of the movie industry collapsing,

37:26.125 --> 37:28.416
leaving all of you penniless.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.625
Why you saying that?

37:29.708 --> 37:33.166
Breathe in, and breathe out that fear

37:33.250 --> 37:36.166
that the world is soon going to realize

37:36.250 --> 37:39.166
you people are not that special.

37:39.666 --> 37:41.583
One might say useless.

37:41.666 --> 37:43.125
-Excuse me, Bola.
-Yeah?

37:43.208 --> 37:46.208
I can't take this.
I can't take this shit no more, please.

37:46.291 --> 37:48.666
Don't judge your thoughts. Observe them!

37:48.750 --> 37:53.041
I can't observe them. This is more
than I can take. Yeah, I'm in pain.

37:53.125 --> 37:56.208
And I'm bored.
Bored as fuck in this hotel!

37:56.291 --> 37:58.125
I need out of the hotel right now!

37:58.208 --> 38:00.833
Howie, let me tell you
about Harmony Ignite.

38:00.916 --> 38:01.958
Sean, do us a favor?

38:02.041 --> 38:04.375
-Yeah.
-Harmony Ignite your asshole!

38:04.458 --> 38:05.916
-Howie!
-Howie, easy!

38:06.458 --> 38:09.083
You can't leave.
You're the comic relief of the movie.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.791
Fuck you, you fucker!
How's that for witty comic relief? Huh?

38:11.875 --> 38:12.708
Howie.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.458
I don't even know why you're complaining.
It's not that bad being here.

38:16.541 --> 38:19.708
Why you talking to me?
Your dances pave the way to the hellfire.

38:19.791 --> 38:21.208
-Howie.
-Oh, my God.

38:21.291 --> 38:24.416
Emotions are like a wave.
You just gotta ride 'em.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.958
-Like a wave?
-Let it pass.

38:26.041 --> 38:28.416
-Let me show you a wave.
-Oh, my God! Howie!

38:28.500 --> 38:29.958
-Howie!
-Let go.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.583
Are you riding the wave?
How's this wave for you?

38:32.666 --> 38:36.250
-Howie, you're hurting him.
-I've got his dick in my hand! His <i>lulli!</i>

38:36.333 --> 38:37.666
Let go of his <i>lulli.</i>

38:37.750 --> 38:39.416
Howie, release! Release!

38:39.500 --> 38:42.166
I'll rip his <i>lulli</i> off
if you keep pushing me!

38:42.250 --> 38:44.625
Don't push me!
That's enough. I'm gone from here.

38:45.208 --> 38:48.375
Sick of this place! What kind
of devilish business going on in here?

38:48.458 --> 38:50.416
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?

38:50.500 --> 38:52.500
I'll tell you what. I'm leaving!

38:52.583 --> 38:56.041
Howie, you are not leaving.
We are in the middle of shooting!

38:56.125 --> 38:58.208
I don't give a shit. You can replace me.

38:58.291 --> 39:00.750
That's not true!
No one can play Jarrar but you.

39:00.833 --> 39:02.083
You're irreplaceable!

39:02.166 --> 39:05.000
Anybody could play Jarrar!
Should I tell you why? Batman!

39:05.083 --> 39:07.041
-Batman?
-He was Michael Keaton, yeah?

39:07.125 --> 39:08.416
Then he was Val Kilmer.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.333
Then George Clooney,
but he brought too much sex to the role!

39:11.416 --> 39:14.416
They got rid of him,
brought in Ben Affleck, Christian Bale,

39:14.500 --> 39:16.791
now he's that skinny bastard
from <i>Twilight.</i>

39:16.875 --> 39:18.625
Not within the same movie!

39:18.708 --> 39:21.833
Zip! Gavin, everybody is replaceable.

39:21.916 --> 39:25.083
This is a very judgmental business.
You leave, you'll be blackballed.

39:25.166 --> 39:27.958
Thank you for your concern, but I am gone!

39:28.041 --> 39:30.625
And you can fuck off!

39:30.708 --> 39:31.625
Howie!

39:31.708 --> 39:34.208
Howie, your weed turned up this morning!

39:34.291 --> 39:36.416
-Howie!
-Howie, where are you going?

39:36.500 --> 39:39.250
-I'm going to London!
-Send help!

39:39.333 --> 39:41.458
-We need you!
-What are you doing?

39:41.541 --> 39:43.125
-Howie! Come on!
-Howie!

39:43.208 --> 39:45.375
-That was pretty good.
-He's okay.

39:45.458 --> 39:49.541
Howie Frangopolous! Come back!

39:52.791 --> 39:53.833
Tah, tah, tah!

39:53.916 --> 39:56.250
That is not London.
He is going the wrong way.

39:56.333 --> 39:58.000
Goodbye, Howie!

39:58.958 --> 39:59.833
Goodbye!

40:08.458 --> 40:11.041
Um… What is going on?

40:11.125 --> 40:15.166
Oh. A little bit of extra protection
for you. A little bit of security.

40:15.750 --> 40:18.208
Don't worry!
We'll pop stickers on your backs.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.875
-Your hands are cold.
-What's going on our backs?

40:20.958 --> 40:22.750
-Hey! That is cold!

40:22.833 --> 40:24.458
Sticker like a name badge?

40:24.541 --> 40:26.833
Kind of, yeah.
Just so we know where you are,

40:26.916 --> 40:28.541
who you are, social distancing.

40:28.625 --> 40:29.875
You're tracking us?

40:29.958 --> 40:31.333
We're keeping you safe.

40:31.416 --> 40:35.458
So it's just for health reasons.
So we can keep the machine moving.

40:35.541 --> 40:37.375
Understood, yeah.

40:37.458 --> 40:38.291
Hey, gang!

40:38.375 --> 40:42.000
I see you've all met Mr. Best,
our new head of security.

40:42.083 --> 40:44.083
We're in good hands with Mr. Best.

40:44.166 --> 40:46.833
He was recently
head of security for DaBaby.

40:46.916 --> 40:48.125
Lovely lad.

40:48.208 --> 40:51.333
I'm not wearing one of those, man.
It's radiation. It's EMF.

40:51.416 --> 40:55.375
Messes with my fucking brain waves.
I don't even wear wireless earbuds.

40:55.916 --> 40:57.916
-Hey!
-Gavin…

40:58.000 --> 40:59.041
Not your job.

40:59.125 --> 41:00.750
He'll do it. He's doing it.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.208
Should we take it easy?

41:02.291 --> 41:03.875
-There you go.
-Okay, all done?

41:03.958 --> 41:05.958
-A little rough.
-That's a little, uh…

41:06.041 --> 41:06.875
What the fuck?

41:06.958 --> 41:11.500
Right, off you go!
There's a Golden Globe waiting for you!

41:11.583 --> 41:14.958
Okay, guys, thank you very much.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

41:15.041 --> 41:18.041
Shit is getting real on <i>Cliff Beasts.</i>

41:18.125 --> 41:19.375
Was that necessary?

41:19.458 --> 41:23.083
No, just trying to get it
in the can, as per instructions.

41:23.166 --> 41:25.875
No one's gonna go
wandering off now, are they?

41:29.833 --> 41:32.666
Maybe Jarrar just wandered off.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.708
You don't wander off on Everest.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.625
He's a quitter.
Once a quitter, always a quitter.

41:37.708 --> 41:40.666
The corporation
will not be happy.

41:40.750 --> 41:43.458
I'm beginning to wonder
about this corporation.

41:46.541 --> 41:47.625
What is this?

41:51.250 --> 41:53.416
This is Jarrar's reversible polar fleece.

41:53.500 --> 41:56.916
Well, maybe he got tired
and he made camp here somewhere.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.916
I am not so optimistic.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.083
What is that?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.500
-Sweet Jesus in a basket.

42:14.541 --> 42:15.583
Is that Jarrar?

42:15.666 --> 42:17.458
It might not be him.

42:17.541 --> 42:20.041
There are a lot
of inexperienced hikers up here.

42:20.125 --> 42:21.500
But that is his belt.

42:22.125 --> 42:24.625
That doesn't mean anything.
I got the same belt.

42:33.083 --> 42:35.458
Looks like… he's feeding.

42:43.416 --> 42:46.083
It is so large. How does it fly?

42:56.583 --> 42:59.375
I checked the whole west face.
No sign of him.

43:08.583 --> 43:10.208
-Cut! It's great.

43:10.291 --> 43:12.541
-What do you think? Is it gonna work?
-Hmm.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.250
-I've got one thought.
-Yeah.

43:15.208 --> 43:16.208
Fuck Howie.

43:18.875 --> 43:19.833
You're bad!

43:24.250 --> 43:25.083
<i>Hello?</i>

43:25.916 --> 43:28.041
Hello. Is Josh there?

43:28.125 --> 43:30.166
<i>Hold on. Josh!</i>

43:30.250 --> 43:31.083
<i>Coming!</i>

43:31.708 --> 43:33.416
<i>Will you turn off the bath?</i>

43:33.500 --> 43:35.291
<i>Hey, Carol. What's up?</i>

43:35.375 --> 43:36.958
Hi. Who was that?

43:37.041 --> 43:39.708
<i>Uh, well, that's Monica.</i>

43:40.333 --> 43:41.333
Who is Monica?

43:41.416 --> 43:42.291
<i>She's the…</i>

43:43.583 --> 43:46.541
<i>the server that you liked</i>
<i>who waited on us on Valentine's Day.</i>

43:46.625 --> 43:48.291
She's the waitress from Baltaire?

43:48.375 --> 43:51.791
<i>Don't say "waitress" with that tone.</i>
<i>She risks her life to feed people!</i>

43:51.875 --> 43:54.208
-Why is she in my house?

43:54.291 --> 43:56.750
<i>Look, I'm just gonna say this, all right?</i>

43:56.833 --> 43:58.291
<i>I'm breaking up with you.</i>

43:58.375 --> 44:00.083
What?

44:00.166 --> 44:02.166
<i>And it's not just about Monica either.</i>

44:02.250 --> 44:05.833
<i>I realized that all you care about</i>
<i>is yourself, and not me.</i>

44:05.916 --> 44:07.250
Where is this coming from?

44:07.333 --> 44:09.875
Of course I care.
I care about you so much!

44:09.958 --> 44:14.083
<i>You care about me so much that you jump</i>
<i>on a plane to London during a plague!</i>

44:14.166 --> 44:17.000
-I can't believe this!
-<i>Say goodbye to Carol!</i>

44:17.083 --> 44:18.083
<i>Who's Carol?</i>

44:22.875 --> 44:24.208
-Pippa?
-Hmm?

44:24.291 --> 44:25.958
Do you wanna have sex with me?

44:27.083 --> 44:28.958
I'm eating, blud.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.583
Sorry. Sorry.

44:32.875 --> 44:33.708
Gunther?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.375
I'm done eating, but I'm okay, thank you.

44:51.125 --> 44:51.958
Hi.

44:52.750 --> 44:53.708
Dr. Lacie.

44:55.041 --> 44:57.458
-I dreamed it would be you.
-You did?

44:57.541 --> 44:59.666
-My name is Zaki.
-Oh, I was gonna ask you.

44:59.750 --> 45:01.250
-Let's talk.
-Okay.

45:05.708 --> 45:06.958
Hello!

45:08.416 --> 45:10.041
-Hey, Rafi!
-Point the camera up.

45:10.125 --> 45:11.208
-Move the camera.
<i>-Fine.</i>

45:11.291 --> 45:12.666
Let me see that…

45:12.750 --> 45:14.625
-Hi!
-Nice 'stache.

45:14.708 --> 45:15.833
How's the homework?

45:15.916 --> 45:19.708
<i>I'm quitting high school. I don't need it.</i>
<i>My friends said I can get a trust fund.</i>

45:19.791 --> 45:21.041
-Guess what?
<i>-What?</i>

45:21.125 --> 45:24.041
Mommy and Papa are back together.

45:24.125 --> 45:27.041
<i>Mom, I thought you were dating</i>
<i>the guy who used to be on</i> Friends!

45:27.125 --> 45:29.625
-Raphael, stop it!
<i>-Dad is the devil!</i>

45:29.708 --> 45:30.750
What?

45:30.833 --> 45:34.583
<i>He's never gonna change! I googled him.</i>
<i>He's done some fucked-up shit.</i>

45:34.666 --> 45:36.666
<i>I've gotta finish my game. Bye!</i>

45:36.750 --> 45:37.750
Rafi!

45:39.625 --> 45:40.958
What a nightmare!

45:41.041 --> 45:44.083
-Ever wonder if we picked the right kid?
-Don't say that.

45:44.166 --> 45:48.833
No, when we got him, they said
he was just shy and that he'd warm up,

45:48.916 --> 45:50.583
but he never warmed up--

45:50.666 --> 45:51.791
<i>I can hear you!</i>

45:52.375 --> 45:54.458
<i>Man, you guys are a bag full of dicks!</i>

45:55.000 --> 45:55.833
Fuck!

45:57.000 --> 45:58.166
No!

45:59.166 --> 46:00.458
That was…

46:00.541 --> 46:02.375
There's no coming back from that.

46:06.166 --> 46:09.333
I don't think we're allowed
to leave the hotel. I signed something.

46:09.416 --> 46:11.791
We're 18. They expect us to do this.

46:11.875 --> 46:13.375
Okay, let's go to London.

46:20.708 --> 46:23.666
Make me smile.

46:24.708 --> 46:26.166
Hmm…

46:28.791 --> 46:30.458
<i>Hello, I'm Kate.</i>

46:30.541 --> 46:33.833
<i>Welcome to your 30-minute morning stretch.</i>

46:33.916 --> 46:37.666
<i>Are you ready</i>
<i>to start a new day with new habits?</i>

46:37.750 --> 46:39.833
Change me. Change me.

46:39.916 --> 46:41.083
<i>-Great!</i>
-Change me.

46:41.166 --> 46:42.166
<i>I'm ready too.</i>

46:42.250 --> 46:46.125
<i>Let's go. We're just gonna start</i>
<i>with a really easy swing.</i>

46:46.208 --> 46:48.958
<i>No stress. Great.</i>

46:49.583 --> 46:50.625
<i>Let's come down.</i>

46:52.041 --> 46:54.541
<i>Let's just take a moment</i>
<i>to connect with the earth.</i>

46:58.041 --> 46:59.708
<i>-Dieter.</i>
-Huh?

47:00.583 --> 47:01.791
<i>You're kind of cute.</i>

47:04.791 --> 47:05.833
<i>I like your hair.</i>

47:07.625 --> 47:09.000
<i>For our next exercise,</i>

47:09.083 --> 47:11.958
<i>I would like you</i>
<i>to enter me for 30 thrusts.</i>

47:12.041 --> 47:14.416
<i>Let's do that ten times,</i>

47:15.083 --> 47:18.625
<i>and continue until I say we're done.</i>

47:20.000 --> 47:21.250
That's a lot of sets.

47:21.833 --> 47:24.583
-I love you, Dr. Lacie.

47:24.666 --> 47:27.333
I love you too. But it's Carol.

47:27.416 --> 47:29.125
Carol Lacie.

47:29.208 --> 47:31.750
-No, just Carol!

47:31.833 --> 47:32.791
Dr. Carol.

47:32.875 --> 47:34.791
-No, I'm not a doctor.

47:35.833 --> 47:36.958
Kate?

47:38.208 --> 47:39.375
Are you me?

47:39.916 --> 47:42.583
<i>I'm you. You're me. I'm horny. Who cares?</i>

47:42.666 --> 47:44.166
This is creepy,

47:44.250 --> 47:45.541
but I like it.

47:45.625 --> 47:48.083
<i>Shut up. Get over here.</i>

47:48.166 --> 47:49.208
Yes, ma'am.

48:04.208 --> 48:05.250
I don't understand!

48:13.416 --> 48:14.375
Did you?

48:15.291 --> 48:16.583
No.

48:16.666 --> 48:18.208
I never orgasm.

48:18.708 --> 48:22.000
Oh!

48:22.083 --> 48:26.291
<i>Are you ready to start a new day?</i>

48:26.375 --> 48:27.583
I'm sorry.

48:29.833 --> 48:33.333
Ronjon, make sure you spend time
on that pineapple. Each groove.

48:34.041 --> 48:34.916
All right.

48:36.625 --> 48:37.625
Thank you.

48:41.791 --> 48:42.708
Oh, my God.

48:43.458 --> 48:44.625
I think I'm sick.

48:45.666 --> 48:48.000
Yeah, you're sick with love.

48:48.083 --> 48:50.541
No, I think it's the virus.

48:51.125 --> 48:53.791
You can't have the virus.
We're in the bubble.

48:59.625 --> 49:01.125
Bola, hold my hair.

49:01.208 --> 49:03.500
Your hair is short.
There is no hair to hold!

49:03.583 --> 49:05.541
Hold my hair!

49:05.625 --> 49:08.166
Uh, I don't want to be here.
I want to resign.

49:08.250 --> 49:09.500
Bola…

49:10.625 --> 49:11.458
Uh…

49:12.750 --> 49:14.541
I really don't want to.

49:15.166 --> 49:17.458
-I'm not supposed to be here.
-Bola…

49:17.541 --> 49:19.208
Where do I hold? Okay!

49:22.500 --> 49:23.916
No! No, no, no, no!

49:28.958 --> 49:31.166
Okay, guys? Uh, listen up.

49:31.250 --> 49:34.250
Uh, I've got some very important
health news for you.

49:34.333 --> 49:38.583
-You all tested negative for the virus.
-Yes!

49:38.666 --> 49:43.833
However, some of you
have tested positive for influenza.

49:44.791 --> 49:46.875
-The good virus.
-The good one.

49:46.958 --> 49:48.375
Two of you tested positive

49:48.458 --> 49:51.708
for two separate cases
of sexually transmitted diseases.

49:52.625 --> 49:55.291
How'd we get the flu? We're in the bubble.

49:55.375 --> 49:57.583
We've narrowed it down
to a delivery person

49:57.666 --> 49:59.875
and one of the gardeners.
We are handling it.

49:59.958 --> 50:01.791
If this is just the normal flu,

50:01.875 --> 50:04.250
we could push on
and complete the day, right?

50:04.333 --> 50:05.833
Absolutely, yeah.

50:05.916 --> 50:09.375
Actors are some of the toughest people
I know. We can handle it.

50:09.458 --> 50:13.416
I once played host
to a 30-foot-long tapeworm

50:13.500 --> 50:16.333
during <i>Cliff Beasts 2,</i>
and nobody even knew.

50:16.416 --> 50:19.625
I broke my wrist and ankle
on the last movie I did.

50:19.708 --> 50:22.500
-I didn't tell anybody.
-Good lad. That's the spirit.

50:22.583 --> 50:25.416
I'm very concerned about Carol and Dieter.

50:25.500 --> 50:28.416
I think they should at least
have the rest of the day off.

50:28.500 --> 50:31.041
We're not shutting this down
for a bit of snot.

50:31.125 --> 50:35.083
Let's have a show of hands, okay?
Who wants to power through today?

50:36.625 --> 50:40.958
Right, let's get out there
and kill some cliff beasts!

50:41.041 --> 50:42.541
-Yeah!
-Yes!

50:49.666 --> 50:50.791
I can hear something!

50:51.833 --> 50:53.250
The nest must be close.

50:59.375 --> 51:02.666
You guys better get moving,
or you're gonna be bird seed.

51:04.208 --> 51:05.625
I don't feel so good.

51:06.875 --> 51:08.708
We should do this another day.

51:10.833 --> 51:12.833
-You got this.
-Lauren?

51:13.833 --> 51:15.083
-Lauren!

51:16.416 --> 51:17.791
Something's up with Lauren.

51:20.458 --> 51:22.041
I can't do this anymore.

51:25.583 --> 51:27.500
Oh, my God, I'm gonna throw up.

51:27.583 --> 51:29.916
Please don't
because then I will too.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.958
Winners never quit,
and quitters never win!

51:33.041 --> 51:36.083
I don't wanna act anymore.
I wanna go back to the room.

51:36.166 --> 51:38.916
Let's shoot it quickly.
You'll be proud when it's done.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.875
Carol, can you stop gaslighting me?

51:40.958 --> 51:45.083
Gaslighting? That is not gaslighting.
You know what? Your generation sucks!

51:45.166 --> 51:46.750
At least I'm not a baby boomer.

51:46.833 --> 51:50.208
I'm not a baby boomer.
I am Generation Y, thank you very much.

51:50.291 --> 51:52.583
Ladies, this is no time for catfighting.

51:57.583 --> 52:00.666
I saw a photo of you at a Nirvana concert.

52:01.166 --> 52:03.125
No, you didn't. That wasn't me.

52:03.208 --> 52:05.208
It doesn't look like they're climbing.

52:05.291 --> 52:07.625
Right, like, why don't they have ropes?

52:07.708 --> 52:11.375
And would they let the little girl
free climb a cliff like this?

52:11.458 --> 52:13.875
Would she even know how to do it?

52:13.958 --> 52:17.083
-I think she's unconscious.
-I think Lauren seems fine.

52:17.166 --> 52:19.041
Wake up, Lauren. Come on. Climb.

52:19.125 --> 52:22.666
For your first time free climbing,
you're doing a great job, guys!

52:22.750 --> 52:25.666
Okay, guys, I really think
I'm gonna throw up.

52:25.750 --> 52:27.416
Maybe call the set medic?

52:27.500 --> 52:29.333
I don't like it when people throw up.

52:29.916 --> 52:30.833
Oh, God.

52:32.958 --> 52:33.916
Whoops.

52:36.250 --> 52:39.708
-Should we bring them down?
-Let's just see how it plays out.

52:39.791 --> 52:43.916
Should we be concerned about this level
of vomit? Just 'cause, you know…

52:44.000 --> 52:45.666
There's something going round.

52:45.750 --> 52:48.750
-It smells like ham or something.
-Shh. It's okay.

52:48.833 --> 52:51.375
I need touch-ups
on hair and makeup, please!

52:51.458 --> 52:53.916
-Can hair and makeup step in, please?

52:54.000 --> 52:57.875
Hey, Lauren? Who would you say
is the most fun person to act with?

52:57.958 --> 53:00.250
<i>Gavin, there's no time for recuperation.</i>

53:00.333 --> 53:02.666
<i>You have to</i>
<i>get the dinosaurs flying again.</i>

53:02.750 --> 53:05.416
-I'm not a magician.
-I know you're not a fucking magician!

53:05.500 --> 53:07.833
If you were,
you could pull a movie out of your ass!

53:07.916 --> 53:10.458
Oh, my God, it's Minnie Driver.
I love her.

53:10.541 --> 53:13.750
You know, these are human beings.
They're not machines.

53:13.833 --> 53:17.708
Bucko, need I remind you,
you used to be addicted to meth.

53:17.791 --> 53:21.416
Once you stayed up for three weeks,
did something bad, and I covered for you.

53:21.500 --> 53:24.875
Okay, yes, I remember.
Thank you for reminding me, Paula.

53:24.958 --> 53:28.041
If I'd ever told anyone, you'd be in jail
for the rest of your life.

53:28.125 --> 53:30.625
Don't make me get tough.
I don't like to get tough.

53:30.708 --> 53:33.166
You do like being tough. You love it.

53:33.250 --> 53:35.458
Can I put something
into perspective for you?

53:35.541 --> 53:38.125
We are one of two movies
in production right now.

53:38.208 --> 53:39.708
-It's us and Tom Cruise.
-Yeah.

53:39.791 --> 53:45.375
<i>If we fail, a $50 billion corporation</i>
<i>is going to go down.</i>

53:45.458 --> 53:47.750
<i>People murder each other over ten grand.</i>

53:47.833 --> 53:51.875
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>they're gonna do over $50 billion?</i>

53:51.958 --> 53:53.708
<i>You ass!</i>

53:53.791 --> 53:54.625
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

53:55.208 --> 53:59.458
<i>Okay, so Mel Gibson is on the boat,</i>
<i>and I think he thinks we're dating.</i>

53:59.541 --> 54:02.208
<i>We did stuff last night.</i>
<i>He's taking it too seriously.</i>

54:02.291 --> 54:03.208
What did you do?

54:03.291 --> 54:05.083
Just over-the-pants stuff.

54:05.750 --> 54:06.833
Guy, what's up?

54:07.500 --> 54:10.541
Oh! Listen! I've got
so many presents for you.

54:11.041 --> 54:14.083
These people,
they don't even care about what they have.

54:14.166 --> 54:17.458
Yeah, I've got soap. I've got cream.

54:17.541 --> 54:21.000
I've got… You need a corkscrew?
I'm gonna send you two corkscrews.

54:21.083 --> 54:24.458
There's Bibles everywhere, in every room.
They don't even read them!

54:24.541 --> 54:28.333
I'm gonna send it to you so we can pray
for them 'cause they're all going to hell.

54:29.250 --> 54:32.250
-They're mistreating you.
-Mmm.

54:32.333 --> 54:33.666
Makes me furious.

54:35.083 --> 54:36.541
You know what you need to do?

54:37.250 --> 54:39.291
You need to lead a revolution.

54:40.375 --> 54:42.750
Yes, revolution.

54:42.833 --> 54:46.958
You're like little cogs
in the machine. Don't you see it?

54:47.041 --> 54:49.041
They've been using you!

54:49.125 --> 54:53.833
You're going to burn down
the machinery of corporate capitalism.

54:53.916 --> 54:55.958
-Yes.
-They are not the power.

54:56.041 --> 54:59.333
You are the power!
Only you can make the change!

55:00.125 --> 55:01.500
It has to be me!

55:01.583 --> 55:02.583
It has to be you.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.958
We are working too many hours,
and we are way over schedule.

55:07.041 --> 55:09.000
It is unfair and unsafe.

55:09.583 --> 55:13.458
Carol, why do you want us to bail?
Just tell us why.

55:13.541 --> 55:16.083
I'm not saying "bail."
I'm saying "threaten to bail."

55:16.166 --> 55:19.125
We're all gonna team up together,
like the cast of <i>Friends?</i>

55:19.208 --> 55:21.208
-No.
-You want us to bribe them then?

55:21.291 --> 55:24.125
-Not what I'm saying.
-You want us to blackmail the studio.

55:24.208 --> 55:25.625
What are you not hearing?

55:25.708 --> 55:28.541
Every day,
I eat the KitKat in the minibar,

55:28.625 --> 55:31.458
and then I come back
and there's a new KitKat.

55:32.333 --> 55:33.708
I'm not giving this up.

55:33.791 --> 55:36.791
I knew she was gonna do this.
I knew you were gonna do this.

55:36.875 --> 55:39.375
What did I tell everybody?
Not to have her come back,

55:39.458 --> 55:44.208
because you are a leaver, and you
are trying to get us to be leavers too.

55:44.291 --> 55:46.166
-I thought you forgave me.
-Did I?

55:46.250 --> 55:47.666
-You said you did.
-Did I?

55:47.750 --> 55:50.416
-Lauren!
-I just hadn't seen you in a while.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.208
Hey, little girl over there,
why are you always here?

55:54.708 --> 55:56.541
My dad's the stunt coordinator.

55:57.416 --> 55:59.625
He doesn't love me, so…

55:59.708 --> 56:02.416
All right, uh,
maybe we should vote on this.

56:02.500 --> 56:04.750
Okay, let's do it. Who's in?

56:05.750 --> 56:08.375
This is great! Let's go make our demands!

56:08.458 --> 56:10.750
No, we're in to finish the movie.

56:10.833 --> 56:14.291
That's not what I said! I said,
"Are you in to be out of the movie?"

56:14.375 --> 56:15.916
Then you should have said <i>out!</i>

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
No. I explained the plan, and then I said,
"Are you in for the plan?"

56:20.083 --> 56:23.166
Why would we listen to someone
who doesn't know how voting works?

56:23.250 --> 56:24.541
Guys, I am proud of you.

56:24.625 --> 56:27.708
Do you understand
that, together, we can do anything?

56:27.791 --> 56:32.083
And I'm manifesting right now,
for all of us, a classic!

56:32.166 --> 56:34.083
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

56:34.166 --> 56:35.208
That's where it's at.

56:35.291 --> 56:39.083
Hey, no, stop! This is not finished yet.
You stole my meeting!

56:39.166 --> 56:41.416
<i>Cliff Beasts 6!</i>

56:41.500 --> 56:44.083
Whoo!

56:51.541 --> 56:53.916
Mr. Best, is all this necessary?

56:54.000 --> 56:55.708
Maybe, maybe not.

56:56.375 --> 56:58.166
This is a hotel, not a war zone.

56:58.250 --> 57:00.625
My job's to look after these people,
not imprison them.

57:00.708 --> 57:03.958
You don't care about them.
You just wanna get the job done!

57:04.041 --> 57:08.166
Like a sergeant pretends to care about
the soldiers before he sends them off

57:08.250 --> 57:09.500
to die.

57:09.583 --> 57:13.916
Now, let's finish this film and go home!

57:18.791 --> 57:19.916
-Hey, Gavin?
-Hi.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.791
What's going on?
All my lines are gone from the next scene.

57:22.875 --> 57:26.375
Oh, that can't be true.
She has lines in this, doesn't she?

57:26.458 --> 57:29.250
Uh, only nonverbal lines.

57:29.333 --> 57:32.500
But I'm supposed to emotionally connect
with the baby cliff beast.

57:32.583 --> 57:37.250
Oh, yes! That's right. The studio wanted
Krystal to do that because she's young.

57:38.125 --> 57:39.000
I'm young.

57:39.083 --> 57:41.750
They thought
she'd connect more with the baby beast.

57:41.833 --> 57:44.583
-Why?
-Well, she's the baby.

57:44.666 --> 57:46.166
And you're not now.

57:46.250 --> 57:50.250
The studio know that you're overworked.
And they heard you.

57:50.333 --> 57:53.291
-What do you mean, "They heard me"? What?
-They heard you.

58:05.208 --> 58:07.333
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

58:09.333 --> 58:10.375
No.

58:10.458 --> 58:11.916
Cole, put that goddamn gun down.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.333
That baby dinosaur has just as much right
to be on this planet as we do.

58:15.416 --> 58:16.958
It's not about the planet.

58:17.041 --> 58:18.250
It's about justice!

58:18.333 --> 58:19.666
No, put it down!

58:19.750 --> 58:21.583
God damn it, Vivian.

58:21.666 --> 58:23.958
How can you be so naive?

58:24.583 --> 58:26.500
These things are killers.

58:26.583 --> 58:30.000
They killed Jarrar,
and they killed your parents!

58:30.083 --> 58:32.750
They killed your parents dead.

58:32.833 --> 58:34.958
Not all of them are beasts.

58:35.041 --> 58:36.583
But maybe some of us are!

58:38.541 --> 58:42.125
Vivian, what are you doing?
Come here! Get back here now! Shit.

58:42.708 --> 58:45.041
You're gonna wind up dead,
like your momma!

58:51.041 --> 58:52.875
-Come here, little guy.

59:10.375 --> 59:11.625
He's just hungry.

59:11.708 --> 59:13.625
It's like she's dino psychic.

59:14.375 --> 59:17.333
You're safe now. No one's gonna hurt you.

59:17.416 --> 59:20.083
If that thing moves,
I'm gonna blow its fucking head off.

59:25.416 --> 59:26.291
Wow.

59:27.041 --> 59:28.958
-Okay.

59:34.583 --> 59:36.083
He's learning

59:36.166 --> 59:37.166
from her.

59:38.958 --> 59:41.333
Okay, let's see if you can do these steps.

59:45.041 --> 59:46.875
Very good. Very good.

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.041
Wow.

1:00:13.333 --> 1:00:15.958
Looks like we're about
to have us a hoedown.

1:00:16.041 --> 1:00:18.500
All right, here we go.

1:00:30.291 --> 1:00:32.083
Now I know

1:00:32.166 --> 1:00:34.291
I must kill them all.

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.458
Whoa!

1:01:02.250 --> 1:01:03.083
And cut!

1:01:06.750 --> 1:01:07.958
Really nice work.

1:01:09.291 --> 1:01:12.166
Can you stop?
You don't need to do that anymore.

1:01:12.250 --> 1:01:14.166
Hey, you looked amazing!

1:01:14.250 --> 1:01:16.083
Darren, this is such bullshit.

1:01:16.166 --> 1:01:19.875
That was supposed to be my big scene,
and now all I do is piss myself.

1:01:19.958 --> 1:01:22.375
Urination is a very real
and human reaction

1:01:22.458 --> 1:01:24.208
to getting roared at by a cliff beast.

1:01:24.291 --> 1:01:26.375
-It's humiliating!
-I wouldn't worry about it.

1:01:26.458 --> 1:01:30.166
We've got to serve the <i>Cliff Beast</i> nerds,
the fans out there.

1:01:30.250 --> 1:01:31.791
They want authenticity.

1:01:31.875 --> 1:01:35.875
Krystal just did a fucking TikTok
with a dinosaur. Is that authentic?

1:01:35.958 --> 1:01:38.625
That dance is the clip
they're gonna use in the Oscars.

1:01:38.708 --> 1:01:41.208
-What? No, they're not.
-Oh, believe me.

1:01:41.291 --> 1:01:46.875
Gavin, we gotta shut down, buckle down,
focus, and I will rewrite that script.

1:01:46.958 --> 1:01:49.333
You give me two weeks,
and I'll have it rocking.

1:01:49.416 --> 1:01:50.750
Shut down for two weeks?

1:01:50.833 --> 1:01:53.750
Yeah, like they did with <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>
That's the model.

1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:57.375
-What?
-We are not shutting down for two weeks.

1:01:57.458 --> 1:01:59.625
We told Rafi
we'd be gone for three months.

1:01:59.708 --> 1:02:01.416
It's been five and a half!

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:04.000
I didn't come all this way
to not have it work out.

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:07.625
Rafi will understand
when he sees how great the movie is.

1:02:07.708 --> 1:02:09.625
None of these movies are great.

1:02:09.708 --> 1:02:12.375
Hey, I am modeling for him
the value of hard work

1:02:12.458 --> 1:02:14.416
and perseverance and responsibility.

1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:16.875
That is the best thing
a father can do for a child.

1:02:16.958 --> 1:02:20.000
No, the best thing
a parent can do is be present.

1:02:20.083 --> 1:02:23.708
I told you, my dad took him out to lunch
at Nobu, and he seemed fine.

1:02:23.791 --> 1:02:25.041
-You think he's fine?
-Yeah.

1:02:25.125 --> 1:02:27.750
He started a GoFundMe
for a kidney transplant!

1:02:27.833 --> 1:02:29.083
How much did he raise?

1:02:29.166 --> 1:02:30.958
$79,000!

1:02:31.041 --> 1:02:32.333
Kid's an entrepreneur.

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:35.750
He's only been a part
of our family for 17 months!

1:02:35.833 --> 1:02:36.791
I hate to say this,

1:02:36.875 --> 1:02:41.333
but this franchise has been in my life
a lot longer than Rafi has.

1:02:41.416 --> 1:02:43.125
You are so screwed up.

1:02:43.208 --> 1:02:47.000
I'm gonna make sure
that you get put on some no-adoption list!

1:02:47.083 --> 1:02:49.708
-Please, will you do that?
-You'll never adopt again!

1:02:49.791 --> 1:02:51.791
Oh, yeah? I'll adopt again.

1:02:51.875 --> 1:02:54.500
I'll adopt half
of South America if I want!

1:02:54.583 --> 1:02:58.958
You know, Peru, Chile, Venezuela.
Come on, you're living with me!

1:03:01.875 --> 1:03:03.250
What are you doing?

1:03:03.750 --> 1:03:04.583
I'm packing.

1:03:05.208 --> 1:03:06.208
You're leaving?

1:03:06.791 --> 1:03:08.958
-Yeah, tomorrow we have a game.
-Oh.

1:03:09.041 --> 1:03:10.583
-Didn't I tell you?
-No.

1:03:11.416 --> 1:03:14.500
So what do we do now?
I mean, can I get your email?

1:03:14.583 --> 1:03:15.625
Of course.

1:03:16.333 --> 1:03:17.416
Okay, what is it?

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.666
-Oh, you want it now?
-Mm-hmm.

1:03:19.750 --> 1:03:21.000
Oh, but I'm packing.

1:03:21.083 --> 1:03:23.041
Okay, what is going on?

1:03:23.125 --> 1:03:24.541
-What?
-I'm a bit confused.

1:03:24.625 --> 1:03:26.791
I thought we had something serious.

1:03:26.875 --> 1:03:28.916
Here's the thing. I'm married.

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:30.000
What?

1:03:30.083 --> 1:03:31.333
I have five kids.

1:03:31.416 --> 1:03:34.166
-You have five kids?
-With three different women.

1:03:34.250 --> 1:03:36.833
-With three different women?
-I have three more coming.

1:03:37.541 --> 1:03:38.708
With two other women.

1:03:38.791 --> 1:03:40.708
Wow. Okay, so,

1:03:41.541 --> 1:03:43.208
maybe I should call your wife.

1:03:43.291 --> 1:03:45.708
Really? You'd do that?

1:03:45.791 --> 1:03:47.833
Yes, you better believe it.

1:03:47.916 --> 1:03:50.875
Oh, she will love it!
She's a huge fan of yours.

1:03:50.958 --> 1:03:53.916
Okay, I'm sorry, I just…
I don't know what's happening.

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.208
We have a very European relationship
with my wife.

1:03:56.291 --> 1:03:57.625
Okay, what does that mean?

1:03:57.708 --> 1:03:59.750
That I'm allowed to have sex with you.

1:03:59.833 --> 1:04:00.958
Oh, wow.

1:04:01.041 --> 1:04:03.041
Okay, this is… What?

1:04:03.125 --> 1:04:05.166
No, don't be sad.

1:04:05.250 --> 1:04:06.166
You had fun.

1:04:07.083 --> 1:04:08.916
Now, I meant to ask you,

1:04:10.291 --> 1:04:11.291
do you have PayPal?

1:04:11.375 --> 1:04:12.208
Yes?

1:04:12.291 --> 1:04:14.875
Because that KitKat
and that water you had last night?

1:04:14.958 --> 1:04:16.625
It cost £26.

1:04:23.458 --> 1:04:24.291
Anika…

1:04:25.041 --> 1:04:27.375
-You're working the night shift?
-Yes, I do.

1:04:29.625 --> 1:04:31.291
I see the way you look at me.

1:04:31.833 --> 1:04:35.541
Yeah, I feel the same way,
and I want you to know

1:04:35.625 --> 1:04:39.791
I wanna rip your clothes off
and have my way with you like an animal.

1:04:39.875 --> 1:04:41.750
-That's amazing.
-Yeah, it is.

1:04:41.833 --> 1:04:43.208
-But--
-Hi.

1:04:45.041 --> 1:04:46.333
Where are you guys going?

1:04:46.416 --> 1:04:49.833
Um… To help him plunge his toilet.

1:04:50.666 --> 1:04:51.750
Huh.

1:04:51.833 --> 1:04:54.083
I'll do it. I'll plunge his toilet.

1:04:54.166 --> 1:04:55.416
Let me handle his toilet.

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:57.541
I would plunge
the hell out of your toilet.

1:04:57.625 --> 1:04:59.500
I would. Let me plunge your toilet.

1:04:59.583 --> 1:05:01.416
I want to plunge this toilet!

1:05:01.500 --> 1:05:03.208
I'm only trying to take care of you,

1:05:03.291 --> 1:05:05.375
so you don't find yourself
in the wrong toilet.

1:05:05.458 --> 1:05:08.416
You're not in charge
of which toilet I should plunge!

1:05:08.500 --> 1:05:12.333
I'm just doing what's right for you
and his toilet, which I will now plunge.

1:05:12.416 --> 1:05:14.958
I will handle this toilet.
I'm gonna clean your toilet.

1:05:15.041 --> 1:05:17.291
Sir, let's go. Thank you, Anika.

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:20.458
Where are you?

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:22.208
<i>I'm in our bed.</i>

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:26.041
<i>It's so cozy and warm. Feels like home.</i>

1:05:26.125 --> 1:05:30.083
I can't wait till this movie's over.
I miss being there with you sometimes.

1:05:30.166 --> 1:05:32.208
I'm sorry this has been so hard.

1:05:32.291 --> 1:05:34.583
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

1:05:34.666 --> 1:05:36.750
<i>Carol's still not over it.</i>

1:05:37.416 --> 1:05:40.625
<i>-Oh, poor girl.</i>
<i>-Yeah, she's really struggling right now.</i>

1:05:40.708 --> 1:05:44.791
What? You can't just live in my house
with your new girlfriend!

1:05:44.875 --> 1:05:49.000
<i>Hey, I'm house-sitting for you for free!</i>
<i>Pump the brakes, Carol!</i>

1:05:49.083 --> 1:05:54.458
<i>-Hey, what do you want from Postmates?</i>
<i>-We did Chinese last night, right?</i>

1:05:54.541 --> 1:05:55.500
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1:05:55.583 --> 1:05:57.166
<i>-I could do Thai?</i>
<i>-I could do Thai.</i>

1:05:57.250 --> 1:06:00.583
Do not Postmates to my house!
I'm coming home right now!

1:06:04.791 --> 1:06:07.458
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I'm locking the script.

1:06:08.041 --> 1:06:11.458
You won't be needing these anymore.
You know why? Because you're done!

1:06:12.666 --> 1:06:13.541
Back away!

1:06:13.625 --> 1:06:16.250
-Eddie Vedder gave me that guitar!
-I don't care!

1:06:23.041 --> 1:06:25.166
-That doesn't bother me.
-Oh, no?

1:06:25.250 --> 1:06:26.541
My work is in the cloud.

1:06:26.625 --> 1:06:30.208
Are you sure, SummerBoy1987?

1:06:30.291 --> 1:06:31.666
That's my cloud!

1:06:31.750 --> 1:06:33.416
-It's not anymore!

1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:35.541
Rafi, look in the camera!

1:06:36.458 --> 1:06:37.875
Look at Daddy's computer.

1:06:37.958 --> 1:06:41.458
Mommy lit it on fire
because Daddy's script is in the computer!

1:06:41.541 --> 1:06:44.416
Daddy's trying to make a movie
that's not a piece of shit,

1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:45.791
like Mommy likes to make.

1:06:45.875 --> 1:06:47.750
Your mom's a hack, Rafi!

1:06:47.833 --> 1:06:49.166
<i>I don't care.</i>

1:06:49.250 --> 1:06:52.541
<i>I don't like movies.</i>
<i>They're too long! Bye.</i>

1:06:53.250 --> 1:06:58.750
Well, this hack is gonna go home
and take care of our little angel.

1:06:58.833 --> 1:07:00.375
He's no angel.

1:07:00.458 --> 1:07:02.583
You think the cat drowned itself?

1:07:02.666 --> 1:07:04.208
Just so you know,

1:07:04.291 --> 1:07:08.541
I know that this thing
is never gonna happen again!

1:07:08.625 --> 1:07:09.458
Ever!

1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:16.958
Rafi! Momma's coming home!

1:07:33.958 --> 1:07:35.625
Freedom!

1:07:55.708 --> 1:07:57.416
Oh, my God!

1:08:03.333 --> 1:08:05.500
That's wonderful work.

1:08:14.958 --> 1:08:19.083
That's my tennis hand, you motherfucker!

1:08:19.166 --> 1:08:20.833
Gavin!

1:08:20.916 --> 1:08:23.166
-He got my fingers!
-You trying to escape too?

1:08:23.250 --> 1:08:25.750
Of course not. I just heard a commotion.

1:08:25.833 --> 1:08:27.916
Calm down.

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000
-What the hell's going on?

1:08:30.083 --> 1:08:33.208
-What are you doing? Why did you hit him?

1:08:33.291 --> 1:08:36.458
-Oh, what did you do to your hand?
-You did this!

1:08:36.541 --> 1:08:39.375
I will sort this. Go back inside.

1:08:40.416 --> 1:08:44.333
-Did you fall in the gravel?
-No! This is all your fault!

1:08:44.416 --> 1:08:47.375
The therapist said not to blame.
Don't blame me!

1:08:50.208 --> 1:08:52.041
What the hell is going on here?

1:08:52.125 --> 1:08:54.583
The security guards, they got confused.

1:08:54.666 --> 1:08:58.416
They thought that Lauren
was a deranged fan, and they shot her,

1:08:58.500 --> 1:09:00.000
and she lost a few fingers.

1:09:00.083 --> 1:09:02.875
She'll be fine. Just a few digits.

1:09:03.666 --> 1:09:04.750
Just a graze.

1:09:06.125 --> 1:09:07.833
Nothing to worry about.

1:09:07.916 --> 1:09:09.708
<i>Gavin, you can't shoot the actors.</i>

1:09:09.791 --> 1:09:13.875
<i>You can't even poison the fuckers</i>
<i>these days. The press always finds out.</i>

1:09:13.958 --> 1:09:17.791
It wasn't my call to shoot them.
Mr. Best reports to you.

1:09:17.875 --> 1:09:20.958
<i>-Mr. Best? Sorry, who's Mr. Best?</i>

1:09:21.541 --> 1:09:22.708
I thought you sent him.

1:09:22.791 --> 1:09:26.708
<i>Mr. Best? I don't…</i>
<i>That does not ring a bell.</i>

1:09:26.791 --> 1:09:30.250
Sounds scary. Sounds like
someone you wouldn't wanna fuck with.

1:09:30.333 --> 1:09:32.958
Someone who'd do anything
to make sure the movie got made.

1:09:33.041 --> 1:09:33.875
Okay.

1:09:34.708 --> 1:09:35.750
We need to shut down.

1:09:35.833 --> 1:09:38.958
<i>-We're not shutting the movie down.</i>
-We are shutting down the movie.

1:09:39.041 --> 1:09:42.625
-We are not shutting down the movie.
-<i>We are shutting down the movie!</i>

1:09:42.708 --> 1:09:46.291
It's not like the world is desperate
for another <i>Cliff Beasts</i> movie!

1:09:46.375 --> 1:09:48.041
This isn't a vaccine!

1:09:48.125 --> 1:09:50.708
This is a <i>Cliff Beasts</i> movie.
There's five of them.

1:09:50.791 --> 1:09:52.333
They're all the same!

1:09:54.250 --> 1:09:56.041
Sorry, I was frozen there for a second,

1:09:56.125 --> 1:09:58.833
but I assume you were agreeing
with everything I was saying,

1:09:58.916 --> 1:10:02.000
and I'm so glad because
if you don't get the movie in the can,

1:10:02.083 --> 1:10:06.375
I'll send one of these fucking elephants
to trample your house and your children.

1:10:06.458 --> 1:10:09.625
Okay? <i>Hakuna matata,</i> my sweet.

1:10:09.708 --> 1:10:11.291
-Wow.

1:10:12.166 --> 1:10:13.583
I so wanna be her.

1:10:14.458 --> 1:10:15.375
Hi, Tom.

1:10:16.041 --> 1:10:17.166
<i>I hate to tell you this,</i>

1:10:17.250 --> 1:10:21.625
<i>but I don't think we have enough time</i>
<i>or money to finish this</i> Cliff Beasts--

1:10:21.708 --> 1:10:23.875
<i>Great, then just get it done</i>
<i>and we'll be in touch.</i>

1:10:23.958 --> 1:10:26.708
I don't think it's possible
to get it done.

1:10:26.791 --> 1:10:31.375
Don't make an enemy of me, Paula.
I will destroy you from within!

1:10:31.458 --> 1:10:34.750
Okay, Tom. Thank you for this opportunity.

1:10:37.750 --> 1:10:39.041
-Hello?
-Li.

1:10:39.125 --> 1:10:42.250
<i>The schedule's impossible</i>
<i>with the budget we have.</i>

1:10:42.333 --> 1:10:44.958
<i>Great. Then get it done</i>
<i>and we will be in touch.</i>

1:10:45.041 --> 1:10:48.041
<i>No, Li, you don't understand.</i>
<i>This is impossible.</i>

1:10:48.125 --> 1:10:51.541
I have faith in you.
You have never let me down before.

1:10:52.125 --> 1:10:52.958
<i>Wait.</i>

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:55.291
<i>Are you in Fiji?</i>

1:10:56.083 --> 1:10:58.500
<i>-Yes, I'm in Fiji.</i>
<i>-I'm down the beach!</i>

1:10:59.083 --> 1:11:01.541
<i>I have not seen anyone in 37 days!</i>

1:11:01.625 --> 1:11:04.625
<i>-You want to play tennis?</i>
<i>-I would love to play tennis!</i>

1:11:04.708 --> 1:11:06.083
<i>-Four o'clock?</i>
<i>-Four o'clock!</i>

1:11:06.166 --> 1:11:09.000
Do you have balls?
Oh, I have balls!

1:11:10.583 --> 1:11:13.208
I spoke to Lauren this morning.

1:11:13.875 --> 1:11:17.541
She loves you all, and she said
the best thing that you could do for her

1:11:17.625 --> 1:11:21.375
would be to make this movie great.

1:11:21.458 --> 1:11:24.416
I spoke to her too,
and she is not being cool about it.

1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:26.833
She's really pissed at me
like it's my fault.

1:11:26.916 --> 1:11:28.541
I didn't shoot her fingers off.

1:11:28.625 --> 1:11:33.500
Mr. Best's team thought that you were
being attacked by a crazed stalker.

1:11:33.583 --> 1:11:35.458
Were they able to reattach her fingers?

1:11:35.541 --> 1:11:38.041
-They, uh, didn't find any of them.

1:11:38.125 --> 1:11:40.666
-All that's left is a thumb.
-This is a blessing.

1:11:40.750 --> 1:11:43.291
Lauren is gonna
come back from this stronger.

1:11:43.375 --> 1:11:47.958
There are a million things you can do
with a thumb. It's not like it's a pinkie.

1:11:48.541 --> 1:11:50.750
When will she shoot
the rest of her scenes?

1:11:50.833 --> 1:11:54.416
Well, we're not gonna shoot
the rest of her scenes. Lauren is wrapped.

1:11:54.500 --> 1:11:57.916
We've got some clever fixes
I don't think anybody's gonna notice.

1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.875
So are <i>we</i> allowed to leave?

1:11:59.958 --> 1:12:03.416
We can't do that, unfortunately.
You have to stay 'cause we have contracts.

1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:04.750
It's called being an adult.

1:12:05.625 --> 1:12:07.791
Fucking Jesus Christ.

1:12:07.875 --> 1:12:11.000
Uh, one hiccup.
Shouldn't be too much of a problem.

1:12:11.083 --> 1:12:14.375
Our stunt coordinator, Steve,
has had a bit of a virus scare,

1:12:14.458 --> 1:12:18.375
so he is going to be joining us
on Zoom today.

1:12:18.458 --> 1:12:21.750
-Oh, it takes so long to shoot action.
-Steve!

1:12:21.833 --> 1:12:25.541
<i>Hey, guys! Hope everybody's excited</i>
<i>for today's stunt sequence.</i>

1:12:25.625 --> 1:12:28.791
Uh, Steve, looks like
you lost some weight.

1:12:28.875 --> 1:12:30.375
<i>I'm the same weight as always.</i>

1:12:31.125 --> 1:12:33.000
All right, uh, let's go through the scene.

1:12:33.083 --> 1:12:36.458
<i>Okay, you know what? Let's run it.</i>
<i>Just as we rehearsed, it's gonna be…</i>

1:12:36.541 --> 1:12:39.708
<i>I froze.</i>
<i>I'm frozen. Did I freeze?</i>

1:12:39.791 --> 1:12:42.041
<i>Fucking bullshit!</i>
<i>I told you it wouldn't work!</i>

1:12:42.125 --> 1:12:44.791
<i>Am I clear now?</i>
<i>Am I coming in clear?</i>

1:12:44.875 --> 1:12:46.000
-Yeah.
-Go ahead.

1:12:46.083 --> 1:12:49.875
<i>Here's how it goes. The action starts</i>
<i>when Dustin engages the first iceman.</i>

1:12:49.958 --> 1:12:53.416
<i>Typical hand-to-hand combat. Remember,</i>
<i>parry, jab, end up with a naked choke.</i>

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:55.375
<i>Okay, take me over to the mound.</i>

1:12:55.458 --> 1:12:58.291
<i>On the mound, Carol's gonna</i>
<i>take out icemen four and five</i>

1:12:58.375 --> 1:12:59.791
<i>with a series of explosions.</i>

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:02.666
<i>Dieter and Krystal, you're providing</i>
<i>cover fire for the icemen,</i>

1:13:02.750 --> 1:13:05.666
<i>and,</i>
<i>Sean, you're gonna walk--</i>

1:13:05.750 --> 1:13:09.416
Question. When I'm supposed
to get to my mark, do I turn to my left?

1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:13.000
Okay, first team, walking on!
Let's do this!

1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:26.666
Oh!

1:13:27.333 --> 1:13:29.125
-Whoo!

1:13:33.875 --> 1:13:35.500
Watch out! Watch out!

1:13:39.166 --> 1:13:41.625
I'd see that movie!

1:13:41.708 --> 1:13:44.333
I forgot to tell you
that my dad sucks at stunts.

1:13:44.416 --> 1:13:47.833
Sorry, think I grabbed the wrong wire.
Let's do another one-- No!

1:13:50.583 --> 1:13:51.500
Bloody hell.

1:13:51.583 --> 1:13:54.041
<i>I was checking my email</i>
<i>real quick. How'd it go?</i>

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:57.291
Um… Not very well. We might have to…

1:13:57.375 --> 1:13:59.750
-Do another take, yeah.

1:14:00.500 --> 1:14:03.791
I want you to call the studio
and tell them to fuck off!

1:14:03.875 --> 1:14:09.208
<i>Well, what happens then when I need</i>
<i>to get a bigger trailer for Mark Ruffalo,</i>

1:14:09.291 --> 1:14:12.625
<i>I ask 'em and they say,</i>
<i>"You just told us to fuck off for Carol"?</i>

1:14:12.708 --> 1:14:16.083
<i>-I can't do that, okay?</i>
-Do I have a hard out date on my contract?

1:14:16.166 --> 1:14:18.791
-No.
-So they could just make me work forever.

1:14:18.875 --> 1:14:22.541
No, not forever. They're not monsters!
They're just trying to make a good movie.

1:14:22.625 --> 1:14:24.083
We're being mistreated!

1:14:24.166 --> 1:14:27.583
Oh, spare me!
You're being "actress-mistreated."

1:14:27.666 --> 1:14:29.750
I'm being fucking human being-mistreated!

1:14:29.833 --> 1:14:33.750
<i>You ever try to teach</i>
<i>a 12-year-old math? It's impossible, okay?</i>

1:14:33.833 --> 1:14:35.208
<i>He's been shut up in his room.</i>

1:14:35.291 --> 1:14:39.500
I walked in there the other day,
and he was watching Japanese taxi porn.

1:14:39.583 --> 1:14:41.333
<i>What is Japanese taxi porn?</i>

1:14:41.416 --> 1:14:42.791
Just what it sounds like.

1:14:42.875 --> 1:14:46.916
They fuck the taxi driver
halfway through the video, in Japan!

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.208
I need you to call the studio
and tell them to stop mistreating us.

1:14:50.291 --> 1:14:52.833
Otherwise, I'm out. I'm walking.

1:14:52.916 --> 1:14:54.291
You walk off the film now,

1:14:54.375 --> 1:14:57.916
you are financially responsible
for any overages that you create.

1:14:58.750 --> 1:15:00.541
What? What does that mean?

1:15:00.625 --> 1:15:04.833
<i>It means that if you leave the movie,</i>
<i>you will owe them 114 million bucks.</i>

1:15:04.916 --> 1:15:06.500
I didn't know that was in there!

1:15:06.583 --> 1:15:08.833
I didn't either.
I didn't read your contract!

1:15:08.916 --> 1:15:11.875
You're not being
a good agent or a good friend.

1:15:11.958 --> 1:15:15.375
I'm being a <i>very</i> good agent.
And you know what? I'm not your friend.

1:15:15.458 --> 1:15:17.875
<i>It's something we pretend</i>
<i>when there isn't a pandemic.</i>

1:15:18.875 --> 1:15:21.208
-I gotta go. It's Mark Ruffalo.
<i>-Don't hang up--</i>

1:15:21.791 --> 1:15:22.708
Hey, Mark.

1:15:42.541 --> 1:15:44.333
Oh, my God, you're in the pool.

1:15:44.416 --> 1:15:45.541
How you doing?

1:15:45.625 --> 1:15:47.541
I thought today was so good.

1:15:47.625 --> 1:15:48.958
You did?

1:15:49.041 --> 1:15:53.250
-Did you not?
-No! Today was a disaster.

1:15:53.333 --> 1:15:56.500
-What are you talking about?
-Everyone got injured in the stunt!

1:15:56.583 --> 1:16:00.708
I mean before the stunt. The scene
that we did before was incredible.

1:16:00.791 --> 1:16:03.208
That was genius,
but everybody got really hurt.

1:16:03.291 --> 1:16:06.833
Yeah, that was unfortunate for sure.
I'm gonna talk to them tomorrow.

1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:11.583
I just… Honestly, I don't think
I have anything left to give.

1:16:12.083 --> 1:16:13.916
I'm so sorry about that.

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:18.583
I guess I was so focused on the dinosaurs,
I forgot there are human beings involved.

1:16:18.666 --> 1:16:20.000
Right.

1:16:20.083 --> 1:16:24.916
Yeah. I'm gonna talk to Gavin. I'm gonna
really change things so that you're happy.

1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:27.291
I am mortified.

1:16:27.375 --> 1:16:29.791
Really? That would be a lifesaver!

1:16:30.416 --> 1:16:32.291
Carol, I'm really sorry.

1:16:40.166 --> 1:16:41.583
I'm gonna fix this.

1:16:45.916 --> 1:16:47.750
-Hey.
-Oh, my God!

1:16:47.833 --> 1:16:49.250
-I'll race you. Come on!
-Hey!

1:16:49.333 --> 1:16:52.083
Come on. Try and catch me!

1:16:52.166 --> 1:16:53.083
Marco!

1:16:55.208 --> 1:16:57.166
Hey, Darren. What's up here?

1:16:57.250 --> 1:16:58.875
These are not my pages.

1:16:58.958 --> 1:17:02.416
Yeah, um, we decided we're just…
We're not gonna shoot those.

1:17:02.500 --> 1:17:07.083
They weren't good, so we're gonna go
and shoot the original script,

1:17:07.166 --> 1:17:10.541
also known as the real script
that was approved by the studio.

1:17:10.625 --> 1:17:12.916
Also known as the worst fucking draft!

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.708
Everybody agrees
that my revisions are kicking ass.

1:17:15.791 --> 1:17:18.000
They clarify
our pro-environmental message.

1:17:18.083 --> 1:17:20.791
People don't care about the environment.

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:24.500
People go to see the movies
to see dinosaurs blow up and die.

1:17:24.583 --> 1:17:28.000
Why? Because dinosaurs kill people.
They're monsters!

1:17:28.083 --> 1:17:31.416
We need a movie with heart.
Ask Martha. Martha?

1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.041
She's our audience.

1:17:33.125 --> 1:17:35.083
Don't the dinosaurs need to live?

1:17:35.166 --> 1:17:39.541
I don't care if dinosaurs die, you know?
I thought they <i>were</i> dead.

1:17:40.500 --> 1:17:43.375
Fine. I'll do your shit word-for-word.

1:17:43.458 --> 1:17:45.458
That fucking scene we're about to shoot,

1:17:45.541 --> 1:17:48.833
I don't know how I'll make it work,
but I will 'cause that's what I do.

1:17:48.916 --> 1:17:50.375
I turn shit into gold.

1:17:51.583 --> 1:17:54.375
You're meant
to slurp those ones back.

1:17:54.458 --> 1:17:58.125
Hey, do you know, I heard
that the movie is going really badly.

1:17:58.208 --> 1:18:02.250
They're gonna extend for another
three months. I can't be happier!

1:18:02.333 --> 1:18:04.916
The longer these shitbags
stay in my hotel,

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.375
the bigger my house
is gonna be when they leave.

1:18:07.458 --> 1:18:11.000
I'm gonna have one of those toilets
that shoots water up my ass,

1:18:11.083 --> 1:18:13.166
heats it and dries it for me.

1:18:13.250 --> 1:18:16.416
-Ronjon is not touching anything anymore.

1:18:16.500 --> 1:18:18.083
Plus, the more we stay here,

1:18:18.166 --> 1:18:22.250
the more Dieter will realize
that he doesn't need anything but me.

1:18:22.333 --> 1:18:23.500
-Ooh!
-Yes.

1:18:23.583 --> 1:18:26.041
-Cheers! Never stop filming!
-Never stop filming!

1:18:26.125 --> 1:18:27.833
Never stop filming!

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:39.916
I'm here.

1:18:40.500 --> 1:18:41.958
We're a family.

1:18:42.041 --> 1:18:43.875
You've always been my hero.

1:18:43.958 --> 1:18:49.583
I know that our love
will get us through this nightmare.

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.333
And cut!

1:19:03.416 --> 1:19:05.291
-Moving on. Excellent.

1:19:08.125 --> 1:19:11.500
Great. That was…
I really felt that. That was powerful.

1:19:11.583 --> 1:19:13.625
-Did I capture her physicality?
-Yeah.

1:19:13.708 --> 1:19:16.666
Yeah, you're fine.
It's just you're six inches too tall.

1:19:17.291 --> 1:19:19.083
-And you're not my wife.
-Okay.

1:19:19.166 --> 1:19:21.625
-She got her hand blown off, my wife.
-I didn't…

1:19:21.708 --> 1:19:25.250
I didn't even go back to help her rehab.
I had to finish this fucking movie.

1:19:25.333 --> 1:19:27.875
-What asshole does that?
-It's a specific situation--

1:19:27.958 --> 1:19:29.166
-Am I an asshole?
-No.

1:19:29.250 --> 1:19:31.583
-The fuck am I doing?
-I don't know.

1:19:32.458 --> 1:19:36.416
I lost my wife and my adopted child
of two years for this?

1:19:37.333 --> 1:19:41.000
All this time I was producing this movie,
I should have been producing my family!

1:19:41.083 --> 1:19:44.083
-Are you a producer?
-Uncredited, but everybody knows.

1:19:44.708 --> 1:19:45.625
See that?

1:19:45.708 --> 1:19:48.916
He's reacting like that because
you made him feel something.

1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:50.208
-Thank you.
-So, well done.

1:19:50.291 --> 1:19:51.416
What even was that?

1:19:51.500 --> 1:19:54.208
That is called a "storm off."
It's a pretty good one.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:58.083
Got any good notes for that, Mr. Sundance?

1:19:58.166 --> 1:20:00.500
This is the moment
you chose to talk to me?

1:20:00.583 --> 1:20:02.500
To come in here and heckle me? <i>You?</i>

1:20:03.291 --> 1:20:06.291
We've got a saying
about people like you in the business.

1:20:06.375 --> 1:20:10.375
They talk about you.
A sucky fucking worst actor.

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:12.958
You're a sellout.
You're ruining everything.

1:20:13.041 --> 1:20:15.500
You're making <i>me</i> look bad.

1:20:15.583 --> 1:20:16.708
You're a poser!

1:20:17.375 --> 1:20:20.000
Just kind of talking and mumbling.
That's not acting!

1:20:22.416 --> 1:20:24.000
I'm posing with my Oscar!

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:29.125
Carol!

1:20:29.208 --> 1:20:33.500
-Hey! What are you mad about?
-I have nothing to do in these scenes.

1:20:33.583 --> 1:20:36.958
They keep trimming me and punishing me.
You were gonna talk to the studio.

1:20:37.041 --> 1:20:38.125
-I did.
-And?

1:20:38.208 --> 1:20:40.875
It didn't go well.
I think it actually backfired.

1:20:40.958 --> 1:20:44.916
You're the director! They'll give you
whatever you want. They'll listen to you.

1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.333
No, they will not!

1:20:46.416 --> 1:20:49.750
They'll bring in Jon Favreau to finish it
and send me home in a body bag.

1:20:49.833 --> 1:20:51.833
I don't want to go
to directors jail, okay?

1:20:51.916 --> 1:20:53.250
-Is everything okay?
-No.

1:20:53.333 --> 1:20:56.708
They cut my lines and won't let me leave.
Nobody is looking out for me!

1:20:56.791 --> 1:21:00.541
That is simply not true, Carol.
I am your advocate. I'm your warrior.

1:21:00.625 --> 1:21:03.416
If you could see how hard I work for you

1:21:03.500 --> 1:21:06.500
behind the scenes,
behind closed doors, on Zoom!

1:21:06.583 --> 1:21:09.416
This is bullshit! You make us work
when we're sick or injured.

1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:10.958
That is not okay!

1:21:11.041 --> 1:21:15.125
I'm sorry, if I might interject,
I just got a call about your grandma.

1:21:15.208 --> 1:21:16.750
-Okay, what?
-She died.

1:21:17.416 --> 1:21:18.458
What?

1:21:18.541 --> 1:21:21.666
Yeah, she's dead. Um, in her sleep, so…

1:21:21.750 --> 1:21:23.666
-I'm so sorry.
-I'm sorry as well.

1:21:23.750 --> 1:21:25.083
Uh…

1:21:25.166 --> 1:21:26.375
-I'm so sorry.
-Okay.

1:21:26.458 --> 1:21:31.083
Uh, so I think I need to go
be with my family right now.

1:21:31.166 --> 1:21:33.333
That's just not gonna be possible, Carol.

1:21:34.083 --> 1:21:35.875
Then make it possible.

1:21:35.958 --> 1:21:37.916
You're not the only one suffering loss!

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.250
My dog got run over.

1:21:39.333 --> 1:21:42.791
Did I burden everybody here with it?
No. I grieved alone.

1:21:42.875 --> 1:21:46.625
Mmm. I had to abandon my cat on the street
just to shoot this movie.

1:21:46.708 --> 1:21:49.875
I got a friend going through
a really hard time, and I can't be there.

1:21:49.958 --> 1:21:52.375
His movie didn't open and he's depressed.

1:21:52.458 --> 1:21:55.333
-How old was your grandma?
-She was 97.

1:21:55.416 --> 1:21:59.125
Well, that's sad, but life has to go on.
And the show has to go on.

1:21:59.208 --> 1:22:02.250
You know what? You have become a monster!

1:22:06.041 --> 1:22:07.875
-Oh, mask!
-Oh, shoot!

1:22:07.958 --> 1:22:09.375
Yeah, I'm drinking, so…

1:22:14.625 --> 1:22:17.333
Dustin, don't be sad.
The dailies look great!

1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.666
<i>Hello, this is Paula from the studio,</i>

1:22:24.750 --> 1:22:28.875
and I just wanted to say thank you all
for your tremendous sacrifice.

1:22:28.958 --> 1:22:30.333
<i>It is worth it.</i>

1:22:30.875 --> 1:22:33.250
<i>Hey, Paula, who are you talking to?</i>

1:22:33.333 --> 1:22:37.166
<i>Beck! Well, I'm talking</i>
<i>to the cast of</i> Cliff Beasts 6!

1:22:37.250 --> 1:22:41.041
<i>No way. Action movie? That's one</i>
<i>of my favorite action movie franchises.</i>

1:22:41.125 --> 1:22:43.708
<i>Really? Mine too!</i>
<i>I hear they have some downtime.</i>

1:22:43.791 --> 1:22:46.583
<i>Maybe you wanna play 'em</i>
<i>some funky grooves.</i>

1:22:47.375 --> 1:22:50.916
<i>Playing funky grooves is what I do best.</i>
<i>Who's in the mood for a ladies' night?</i>

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:54.208
<i>I know I am. Ladies and gentlemen, Beck.</i>

1:22:58.166 --> 1:23:00.958
<i>How's everybody feeling?</i>
<i>You all look so sexy tonight!</i>

1:23:02.666 --> 1:23:04.625
<i>The studio wanted</i>
<i>to show their appreciation</i>

1:23:04.708 --> 1:23:07.500
<i>by having me turn this motherfucker out!</i>

1:23:09.041 --> 1:23:11.375
<i>Whoo! Thank you</i>
<i>for fulfilling your contracts!</i>

1:23:17.333 --> 1:23:18.833
<i>Beck! Whoo!</i>

1:23:18.916 --> 1:23:22.541
<i>Everybody get up out of your seats.</i>
<i>Get up out of your seats! Come on!</i>

1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:49.791
What a night!

1:23:49.875 --> 1:23:51.791
Fuck it, let's dance!

1:24:09.791 --> 1:24:11.875
Son of a bitch!

1:24:13.208 --> 1:24:14.125
Walk away!

1:24:18.333 --> 1:24:20.458
Fuck this place! Whoo!

1:24:35.666 --> 1:24:40.083
I'm on set joined by the amazing cast
of <i>Cliff Beasts 6.</i>

1:24:40.708 --> 1:24:42.458
Carol, what's it been like

1:24:42.541 --> 1:24:45.291
being back on set
with all of your <i>Cliff Beasts</i> buddies?

1:24:45.375 --> 1:24:47.666
It's great!
I find myself smiling the whole time.

1:24:47.750 --> 1:24:49.625
My face hurts from all the smiling.

1:24:51.833 --> 1:24:55.833
Now, we must take a moment to discuss
the difficult times we're all in.

1:24:55.916 --> 1:24:57.958
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1:24:58.041 --> 1:25:00.750
Do any of you have
a thought about what we can do

1:25:00.833 --> 1:25:04.083
to solve the problems
that plague our world right now?

1:25:04.166 --> 1:25:09.291
I have some good news for the world,
and I think it might help a little bit.

1:25:09.375 --> 1:25:13.750
Uh, the studio just decided
that since we're doing such a great job,

1:25:13.833 --> 1:25:17.625
we're gonna roll
right into shooting <i>Cliff Beasts 7.</i>

1:25:17.708 --> 1:25:18.666
-Amazing!
-What?

1:25:18.750 --> 1:25:20.041
As soon as we complete <i>6!</i>

1:25:20.125 --> 1:25:23.250
What do you mean?
I didn't sign up for <i>Cliff Beasts 7!</i>

1:25:23.333 --> 1:25:26.166
-Oh, it's the same shoot.
-No. I'm not doing that.

1:25:26.250 --> 1:25:28.791
I am out. Not doing it! No.

1:25:28.875 --> 1:25:29.875
Is this live?

1:25:29.958 --> 1:25:32.125
Hello, can you hear me?
Please help us, okay?

1:25:32.208 --> 1:25:35.166
They are holding us against our will.
I can't do another movie.

1:25:35.250 --> 1:25:37.625
-I can't! It's not safe here, okay?

1:25:37.708 --> 1:25:41.250
What the fuck happened to the lights?
Can somebody turn those back on?

1:25:41.333 --> 1:25:43.750
-What?
-It's not live.

1:25:43.833 --> 1:25:45.291
-What?
-It's not live.

1:25:46.333 --> 1:25:48.083
-We're not live.
-Oh.

1:25:51.708 --> 1:25:53.833
<i>Hey, Krystal's Kittens.</i>
<i>You may not know me,</i>

1:25:53.916 --> 1:25:56.166
<i>but I am</i>
<i>a really close friend of Krystal's.</i>

1:25:56.750 --> 1:25:58.833
<i>I know we are all struggling</i>
<i>during this time,</i>

1:25:58.916 --> 1:26:02.916
<i>but the</i> Cliff Beasts <i>cast</i>
<i>is being held against its will, partially,</i>

1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:07.041
<i>and forced to complete a film</i>
<i>under very inhumane conditions.</i>

1:26:07.125 --> 1:26:09.458
<i>Lauren Van Chance got her hand shot off,</i>

1:26:09.541 --> 1:26:12.500
<i>and they are making us</i>
<i>work through influenza!</i>

1:26:12.583 --> 1:26:17.083
<i>So we need you to jump on Instagram,</i>
<i>TikTok, Twitter, even LinkedIn,</i>

1:26:17.166 --> 1:26:20.541
<i>and demand that they allow us to go home.</i>

1:26:20.625 --> 1:26:23.166
<i>With full pay. And no repercussions.</i>

1:26:23.250 --> 1:26:26.000
Oh! That is perfect.
Thank you so much, Krystal.

1:26:26.083 --> 1:26:30.333
I'm so happy to help. I know how hard
it's been for some of the older actors.

1:26:30.416 --> 1:26:31.958
Yeah, it's been hard for them.

1:26:32.041 --> 1:26:34.541
-You shouldn't post it.
-What? Why?

1:26:34.625 --> 1:26:37.166
Because you sound
like whiny, spoiled actors.

1:26:37.250 --> 1:26:38.500
I am not spoiled!

1:26:38.583 --> 1:26:41.250
People don't wanna hear
celebrities complain

1:26:41.333 --> 1:26:43.500
about how hard their movie sets are.

1:26:43.583 --> 1:26:45.000
They have real problems.

1:26:45.083 --> 1:26:47.500
What are you talking about?
These <i>are</i> real problems.

1:26:47.583 --> 1:26:49.500
They're never gonna let us go home!

1:26:49.583 --> 1:26:53.916
Hold on. If this is gonna make me
look bad, I am not posting this.

1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.875
I can't ruin my own brand.

1:26:55.958 --> 1:26:57.791
It's not gonna hurt. You're the hero.

1:26:57.875 --> 1:27:00.583
-It would make you look really bad.
-Whoa, uh…

1:27:00.666 --> 1:27:02.083
What did you just do?

1:27:02.166 --> 1:27:03.125
I deleted it.

1:27:03.208 --> 1:27:04.916
What? Why would you…

1:27:05.916 --> 1:27:08.791
She is one of them! Not us!

1:27:08.875 --> 1:27:11.125
She is not! She's my friend.

1:27:11.208 --> 1:27:14.916
You sound like some crazy,
rambling old actress. We're leaving.

1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.708
I am the second youngest one!

1:27:17.791 --> 1:27:18.708
Sorry.

1:27:19.416 --> 1:27:20.416
Aah!

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:22.083
I deserved that.

1:27:23.250 --> 1:27:24.333
You'll survive.

1:27:27.083 --> 1:27:28.083
Fuck you.

1:27:28.625 --> 1:27:32.458
I'm sorry I hit you. I'm just having
a really hard time right now.

1:27:34.875 --> 1:27:37.083
-Hey, Sean.
-You said you wanted to talk to me.

1:27:37.166 --> 1:27:39.083
-Thank you for coming. Come in.
-Sure.

1:27:39.583 --> 1:27:41.625
I'm just having a bit of a hard time,

1:27:41.708 --> 1:27:44.291
and I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

1:27:45.375 --> 1:27:47.333
-Um, Sean?
-Yeah.

1:27:49.458 --> 1:27:51.916
I always thought
you guys were all fucking clowns.

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.375
I thought I was the only one
who had it all together.

1:27:55.041 --> 1:27:56.333
But Josh was right.

1:27:57.125 --> 1:27:59.208
I'm the worst one of all of you.

1:27:59.291 --> 1:28:00.750
-No!
-Yes!

1:28:00.833 --> 1:28:01.666
But you?

1:28:02.916 --> 1:28:05.125
You're always so happy
and positive all the time,

1:28:05.208 --> 1:28:09.916
and I was just hoping that maybe you could
help me because I'm falling apart here.

1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:10.875
Carol.

1:28:11.833 --> 1:28:12.750
Problems?

1:28:13.416 --> 1:28:15.375
They're just lessons in disguise.

1:28:16.875 --> 1:28:21.791
Remember that one step is the first…
There's… You know…

1:28:23.291 --> 1:28:26.958
The first step
in the thousand steps of your journey.

1:28:27.041 --> 1:28:27.958
Okay.

1:28:33.375 --> 1:28:34.208
Every day…

1:28:34.708 --> 1:28:38.708
every day is an opportunity for, uh…

1:28:39.250 --> 1:28:40.208
Uh, for you to…

1:28:40.291 --> 1:28:41.291
For what?

1:28:46.166 --> 1:28:47.500
I don't have a fucking clue.

1:28:48.083 --> 1:28:50.041
I don't know what I'm doing.

1:28:52.041 --> 1:28:53.500
I'm a complete fraud.

1:28:53.583 --> 1:28:55.333
-What?
-I'm sorry.

1:28:55.916 --> 1:28:58.666
The book is great.
You should read the book.

1:28:58.750 --> 1:29:04.333
But please understand, I didn't write it.
Steve Harvey's ghostwriter wrote the book.

1:29:04.416 --> 1:29:07.250
In fact, the only time…

1:29:07.333 --> 1:29:10.041
The only time I ever read it

1:29:10.125 --> 1:29:14.250
was when I was in the recording studio,
making the audio book.

1:29:14.333 --> 1:29:17.291
And I was bored.
I was bored with the whole experience.

1:29:17.375 --> 1:29:21.875
Okay? I'm sorry, but during the pandemic,
I realized that we're all the same.

1:29:22.708 --> 1:29:25.125
And I thought that I was special.

1:29:26.208 --> 1:29:28.666
And, uh, you know, that's all I got.

1:29:30.166 --> 1:29:31.000
But I'm not.

1:29:32.041 --> 1:29:32.875
I'm not.

1:29:34.666 --> 1:29:35.625
Oh, my God!

1:29:36.916 --> 1:29:42.208
<i>Krystal Kris, the most selfish</i>
<i>TikTok superstar in the world,</i>

1:29:42.291 --> 1:29:46.041
<i>snuck out of her movie's bubble,</i>
<i>putting millions of people in danger!</i>

1:29:46.125 --> 1:29:50.125
<i>The UK gives us Prince Harry,</i>
<i>and what do we give them back?</i>

1:29:50.208 --> 1:29:51.958
<i>The Krystal variant?</i>

1:29:52.041 --> 1:29:55.375
We need to do something.
That was a really bad idea.

1:29:55.458 --> 1:30:00.541
<i>Number one priority right now</i>
<i>is canceling Krystal Kris.</i>

1:30:01.291 --> 1:30:03.000
<i>#CancelKrystalKris.</i>

1:30:04.875 --> 1:30:06.333
I just lost 3 million followers,

1:30:06.416 --> 1:30:09.875
and if we don't get the fuck out of here,
I'm gonna lose all of them.

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:12.458
I only have 200.

1:30:20.083 --> 1:30:21.083
There's no answers.

1:30:21.750 --> 1:30:23.083
But there are drugs.

1:30:25.333 --> 1:30:26.416
Ah! Whoo!

1:30:36.166 --> 1:30:37.000
Mmm.

1:30:37.583 --> 1:30:38.833
Oh, that's good.

1:30:48.458 --> 1:30:49.375
Ooh!

1:30:55.875 --> 1:31:00.666
The biggest mistake I made on this movie
is not being on drugs the whole time.

1:31:00.750 --> 1:31:03.208
There should just be a campaign.
"Say yes to drugs."

1:31:03.291 --> 1:31:06.333
I feel very embarrassed
that I used to tell people not to do them.

1:31:06.416 --> 1:31:08.458
People should do them. They're great!

1:31:08.541 --> 1:31:10.666
Can I ask you guys a question?

1:31:10.750 --> 1:31:12.208
Why can't I keep a man?

1:31:12.291 --> 1:31:13.125
Oh, Jesus.

1:31:13.208 --> 1:31:17.958
Okay, so my ex, Josh, he dumped me
and left me for a fucking waitress.

1:31:18.041 --> 1:31:20.375
When I was young, if you saw me,

1:31:20.458 --> 1:31:22.916
you'd just wanna punch me
in the fucking face

1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:26.125
'cause I was that handsome.
You just wanted to ruin it.

1:31:26.208 --> 1:31:29.666
You know what?
This business is so unfair to women, okay?

1:31:29.750 --> 1:31:32.541
It is not fair.
You have to stay young and be skinny,

1:31:32.625 --> 1:31:34.583
but have big boobs at the same time.

1:31:34.666 --> 1:31:37.916
It's impossible because nobody
has that body type without surgery.

1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:40.500
You can't be skinny
and have big boobs at the same time!

1:31:40.583 --> 1:31:43.500
It is physically impossible!
It's impossible!

1:31:43.583 --> 1:31:45.125
Yeah, but it's worth trying.

1:31:45.208 --> 1:31:48.000
Gunther, why do you look
like Benedict Cumberbatch right now?

1:31:48.083 --> 1:31:48.916
I do?

1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.916
Your inner spirit has come out
and that's who you truly are.

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.333
Hello, I'm Doctor Strange.

1:31:54.416 --> 1:31:55.875
Oh, my God, I can't!

1:31:55.958 --> 1:31:58.000
I don't like it. I want you to stop it.

1:31:58.583 --> 1:32:00.541
Stop being Benedict Cumberbatch!

1:32:00.625 --> 1:32:04.333
Everyone, do you think
that I'm worthy of Anika's love?

1:32:04.416 --> 1:32:07.000
I don't have an answer for that, bro.

1:32:07.083 --> 1:32:10.250
She's 27, and she loves me.

1:32:10.333 --> 1:32:11.833
And I…

1:32:13.916 --> 1:32:14.750
Love her.

1:32:15.708 --> 1:32:16.791
Love her.

1:32:17.916 --> 1:32:20.333
Let's go wake up Krystal.
Let's make a fucking TikTok.

1:32:20.416 --> 1:32:21.833
-Yeah, let's TikTok.
-Right now.

1:32:21.916 --> 1:32:26.875
-Ooh! Yes! I love those things!
-TikTok, TikTok. Tick, tick!

1:33:21.166 --> 1:33:22.833
Dieter? Oh, my God, Dieter!

1:33:23.916 --> 1:33:26.125
Are you okay?
Something's wrong with Dieter!

1:33:26.208 --> 1:33:29.000
Okay, wait. What's up?
Dieter, wake up, man.

1:33:29.083 --> 1:33:32.416
-All right, I'm gonna go get help.
-Okay. Oh, my God, Dieter.

1:33:32.500 --> 1:33:34.791
-Oh, my God, what is happening?

1:33:34.875 --> 1:33:37.541
He took a lot of drugs.
I think he's having a bad reaction.

1:33:37.625 --> 1:33:39.916
Okay, what we need to do
is clear his airway.

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:40.833
Okay, how?

1:33:40.916 --> 1:33:44.208
So I'm just expanding
his cheek flesh at the moment.

1:33:44.291 --> 1:33:46.000
-What is the purpose?
-I've got his tongue.

1:33:46.083 --> 1:33:49.250
So he's not gonna swallow his tongue.
Your tongue is in good hands!

1:33:49.333 --> 1:33:51.916
Dieter! Oh, fuck. What's going on?

1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.166
-God. What are you doing?

1:33:54.250 --> 1:33:57.000
It's a heart attack!
We need to attack it back.

1:33:57.583 --> 1:33:59.333
-What? That is not true!
-Heart attack!

1:33:59.416 --> 1:34:02.166
-Medical kit!
-Oh. Can you get me the NARCAN?

1:34:02.250 --> 1:34:03.666
-Yes.
-Oh. I can't deal with this.

1:34:03.750 --> 1:34:06.708
If he's taken opioids,
this should dilute them.

1:34:08.875 --> 1:34:09.708
There we go.

1:34:09.791 --> 1:34:11.000
Come on, Dieter.

1:34:12.833 --> 1:34:15.791
-Doesn't appear to be working.
-Wait! He's allergic to peanuts.

1:34:15.875 --> 1:34:17.291
-Oh!
-Clear!

1:34:17.375 --> 1:34:20.416
Come on, Dieter! Don't you die on me!

1:34:20.500 --> 1:34:22.208
Get out of my way! Everybody back.

1:34:26.375 --> 1:34:28.708
What language
are you speaking?

1:34:28.791 --> 1:34:32.041
When I get stressed, I speak Hindi.
It's a better crisis language.

1:34:32.125 --> 1:34:34.125
-We should shock him now.
-Right, yeah.

1:34:34.208 --> 1:34:35.041
Three…

1:34:35.125 --> 1:34:37.208
Two, one, clear!

1:34:44.083 --> 1:34:45.041
What time is it?

1:34:45.583 --> 1:34:48.083
3:23.

1:34:48.166 --> 1:34:51.833
Okay. Time of death, 3:23.

1:34:51.916 --> 1:34:54.333
-Time of death? Are we calling death?
-Time of death?

1:34:54.416 --> 1:34:55.666
It's over.

1:34:55.750 --> 1:34:59.125
Okay, but what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go to the bar,

1:34:59.208 --> 1:35:04.083
and we're gonna raise a glass, okay,
to what an incredible legacy he had.

1:35:04.166 --> 1:35:06.500
He was a magician. A chameleon.

1:35:07.375 --> 1:35:09.458
A reptile that could change colors.

1:35:09.541 --> 1:35:11.375
His chest is still moving, Gunther!

1:35:11.458 --> 1:35:17.125
He's not alive! Okay? That's just the body
letting him go by moving a little bit.

1:35:17.208 --> 1:35:18.416
That's what that is.

1:35:18.500 --> 1:35:21.708
-They call it death breath.
-I think he wants to come back to us.

1:35:21.791 --> 1:35:24.666
Good night, sweet prince.
Go to that beautiful light!

1:35:24.750 --> 1:35:27.375
-Do not go to the light.
-You can go to the light.

1:35:27.458 --> 1:35:29.250
-Don't go to the light.
-You can go.

1:35:29.333 --> 1:35:30.708
-Come back.
-Go.

1:35:30.791 --> 1:35:31.625
-Don't.
-Hold on!

1:35:31.708 --> 1:35:33.541
Don't let go. Hold on. Come back.

1:35:33.625 --> 1:35:34.708
Oh, my God!

1:35:34.791 --> 1:35:36.791
Wake up! Wake up!

1:35:36.875 --> 1:35:38.291
Can you stop? Stop it!

1:35:38.375 --> 1:35:41.500
It's heatstroke from the dancing!
Let's get him on ice.

1:35:44.041 --> 1:35:45.291
I think we need more ice.

1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.000
-At least the ice will preserve him.
-We gotta get him out of here.

1:35:51.916 --> 1:35:54.583
-What else is in the bag?
-Okay, oh, um…

1:35:55.208 --> 1:35:57.000
-I just--
-Whoa. What happened?

1:35:57.083 --> 1:35:58.416
Where the fuck did you come from?

1:35:58.500 --> 1:36:01.541
-Oh, my God, was the dance that hard?
-What's happening?

1:36:01.625 --> 1:36:03.291
-Yeah, on him.
-Dieter.

1:36:03.375 --> 1:36:05.375
Oh, my God. Dieter!

1:36:05.458 --> 1:36:08.583
-What is happening?
-He just went down.

1:36:08.666 --> 1:36:11.333
-What are we doing to save him?
-We haven't tried this.

1:36:11.416 --> 1:36:13.666
-Give it to me.
-Oh. She's just gonna do it.

1:36:14.375 --> 1:36:16.208
-Oh, my God! Anika!

1:36:18.958 --> 1:36:20.250
Oh, my God!

1:36:20.333 --> 1:36:22.250
-I knew it was gonna work!
-Yes!

1:36:22.333 --> 1:36:24.291
-All right!
-Oh, my God!

1:36:24.375 --> 1:36:26.250
Whoo!

1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.000
You saved me.

1:36:29.791 --> 1:36:30.625
Yes.

1:36:33.416 --> 1:36:34.583
You are an angel.

1:36:35.166 --> 1:36:37.750
Yes. I was trying to tell you.

1:36:40.208 --> 1:36:41.666
You do love me?

1:36:42.333 --> 1:36:44.750
I've loved you for a thousand years,

1:36:44.833 --> 1:36:47.875
and I will love you
for another thousand years.

1:36:49.666 --> 1:36:52.166
Can someone take the needle out?
It's a little too much.

1:36:52.250 --> 1:36:55.208
Yes, this is disgusting.
Let me have this. Thank you!

1:36:56.458 --> 1:36:57.833
Oh, my God, guys.

1:36:57.916 --> 1:37:00.875
Look around.
Think about what just happened.

1:37:00.958 --> 1:37:02.500
We worked together,

1:37:02.583 --> 1:37:05.916
and together, we saved a life.

1:37:07.083 --> 1:37:10.625
And we may fight it,
and, oh, how we fight it,

1:37:10.708 --> 1:37:12.541
but we are a family.

1:37:14.208 --> 1:37:15.833
A <i>Cliff Beasts</i> family.

1:37:16.833 --> 1:37:19.208
And that is just such a beautiful thing.

1:37:19.791 --> 1:37:22.833
Listen to me. This is…
This is not even me acting.

1:37:22.916 --> 1:37:24.791
No, we know. That felt real.

1:37:24.875 --> 1:37:29.125
And we have to come together as a family
and lead each other to freedom

1:37:29.208 --> 1:37:31.708
because we are heroes.

1:37:31.791 --> 1:37:34.958
I don't understand the metaphor.
Are we heroes or family?

1:37:35.041 --> 1:37:38.041
We're both! We are a family of heroes,

1:37:38.125 --> 1:37:41.750
and we are going to save our family
because we are the heroes and the family,

1:37:41.833 --> 1:37:44.958
and that's what heroes do,
is save their families.

1:37:45.041 --> 1:37:46.541
So we're a family now.

1:37:46.625 --> 1:37:49.416
No, that's just for the actors.
They still think we're shit.

1:37:49.500 --> 1:37:52.625
Thank you for being my family
and for helping me through all of this.

1:37:52.708 --> 1:37:55.625
I love you all
from the bottom of my heart,

1:37:55.708 --> 1:37:59.041
and I now see what I have to do
and my reason for being here,

1:37:59.125 --> 1:38:01.750
and it is to lead you all to freedom.

1:38:01.833 --> 1:38:05.500
I don't understand. You're leading us
to freedom. Where is freedom?

1:38:05.583 --> 1:38:08.333
Freedom is the fuck out of here!

1:38:08.416 --> 1:38:11.083
That's the cocaine talking right there.

1:38:27.541 --> 1:38:29.583
Can't they see we're trying to save them?

1:38:29.666 --> 1:38:31.291
We can't save them if they're dead!

1:38:31.375 --> 1:38:33.916
If they touch this wire,
we can knock them out

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.916
and take them to an ice cave
and figure out how to care for them.

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.125
Good idea, Vivian!

1:38:47.750 --> 1:38:50.166
I know a better way.

1:38:50.250 --> 1:38:52.291
Let's put them to sleep,

1:38:53.083 --> 1:38:54.666
permanently!

1:38:56.708 --> 1:38:58.041
He's a madman!

1:38:58.125 --> 1:39:02.208
If we get them in the reproductive organs,
their hormones are toxic and flammable.

1:39:02.291 --> 1:39:06.500
Gio, you promised
to honor and protect them!

1:39:06.583 --> 1:39:08.250
Well, you silly little girl,

1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000
looks like Gio lied.

1:39:16.083 --> 1:39:17.333
No, stop!

1:39:18.125 --> 1:39:22.166
Why, Gio, why? All for a luxury hotel?

1:39:22.250 --> 1:39:24.666
The cliff beasts must burn!

1:39:25.166 --> 1:39:27.625
And if all of you stand beside them,

1:39:27.708 --> 1:39:31.791
then you will burn with them!

1:39:35.625 --> 1:39:40.083
-Cliff beasts!

1:39:40.166 --> 1:39:41.541
Gio!

1:39:41.625 --> 1:39:43.166
Let's help him!

1:39:43.250 --> 1:39:45.625
Save me! Aah!

1:39:46.583 --> 1:39:48.000
-No!
-No!

1:39:53.125 --> 1:39:55.458
I can't look! It's horrible!

1:39:56.833 --> 1:40:01.250
I hate to admit it, but unfortunately,
Gio just proved his own point.

1:40:01.333 --> 1:40:02.208
What?

1:40:04.541 --> 1:40:05.833
We have to kill them all.

1:40:08.416 --> 1:40:09.375
He's right.

1:40:12.583 --> 1:40:13.791
Let's do this.

1:40:14.625 --> 1:40:18.333
Light the sky on fire!

1:40:20.375 --> 1:40:22.666
Die, you feathered fucks!

1:40:29.166 --> 1:40:32.125
Shoot their reproductive organs.
They're flammable!

1:40:32.208 --> 1:40:34.250
Go for the nuts!

1:40:34.333 --> 1:40:36.250
Balls!

1:40:46.416 --> 1:40:49.875
Die, nature! Die!

1:40:50.500 --> 1:40:53.166
Darren, I hate this rewrite.
This is so stupid.

1:40:53.250 --> 1:40:55.083
-Cut!

1:40:55.166 --> 1:40:57.291
What? It looks great.

1:40:57.375 --> 1:40:59.000
So the ending that you came up with

1:40:59.083 --> 1:41:03.041
is me shooting at cock and balls
with a flamethrower? That's what you got?

1:41:03.125 --> 1:41:06.083
Dustin, you're misunderstanding
what this is gonna look like.

1:41:06.166 --> 1:41:08.083
It's not cock and balls.

1:41:08.166 --> 1:41:09.958
These are reproductive organs.

1:41:10.041 --> 1:41:13.375
It comes out of the dinosaur
like a jellyfish,

1:41:13.458 --> 1:41:15.791
and it just moves towards the camera.

1:41:15.875 --> 1:41:19.041
And the little tentacles,
and it's fluorescent,

1:41:19.125 --> 1:41:22.833
and it goes back into the body.
It looks beautiful!

1:41:22.916 --> 1:41:24.583
The people from <i>Paddington</i> made it.

1:41:24.666 --> 1:41:26.791
Why would I shoot
at a gelatinous,

1:41:26.875 --> 1:41:28.791
pulsing dinosaur dick and balls like that?

1:41:28.875 --> 1:41:31.791
That sounds like you're attacking
some kind of defenseless thing.

1:41:31.875 --> 1:41:36.375
You're the hero! You have to kill them.
Otherwise they'll take over the world!

1:41:36.458 --> 1:41:38.541
Why don't we
just shoot 'em in the asshole?

1:41:38.625 --> 1:41:42.458
It's not even a dick.
It's a metaphor for the virus.

1:41:43.041 --> 1:41:44.458
Martha, does it look beautiful?

1:41:44.541 --> 1:41:47.375
Uh, well, personally,
I find it a bit troubling,

1:41:47.458 --> 1:41:49.833
but, um, it doesn't look like a dick.

1:41:49.916 --> 1:41:51.666
It doesn't look like a dick.

1:41:51.750 --> 1:41:53.416
Not any dick that I've seen.

1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:55.000
You think that makes it okay?

1:41:55.083 --> 1:41:57.625
That their dick and balls
look like a jellyfish?

1:41:57.708 --> 1:42:01.083
Can we be brought down whilst you chat?
To have a little cigarette break?

1:42:01.875 --> 1:42:03.000
Hey, how you doing?

1:42:05.416 --> 1:42:06.958
You know what, Dustin?

1:42:07.041 --> 1:42:09.333
I'm in charge of this movie.

1:42:09.416 --> 1:42:12.083
You're gonna do what I tell you to do.
Sorry, everybody.

1:42:15.041 --> 1:42:18.333
I am the painter, and you are the paint!

1:42:18.416 --> 1:42:21.375
I think this is gonna really work.
I think this is really fun.

1:42:22.041 --> 1:42:23.125
Who the fuck is that?

1:42:23.208 --> 1:42:24.916
Don't insult my mocap men!

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:29.333
You know what, guys? As soon as we wrap,
I'm gonna punch you both in the jaw.

1:42:29.416 --> 1:42:31.666
Well, I'm gonna write you
a stern bloody email.

1:42:31.750 --> 1:42:34.416
Guys! The sooner we get everybody…
Where's the cast?

1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.375
Where's the fucking cast?

1:42:36.458 --> 1:42:38.166
Gavin! Where is everybody?

1:42:38.250 --> 1:42:39.166
I don't know.

1:42:39.250 --> 1:42:42.166
First team, we need you
on set. We are not done shooting.

1:42:42.250 --> 1:42:43.458
First fucking team!

1:42:43.541 --> 1:42:46.000
Come on, guys! We're losing time!

1:42:46.083 --> 1:42:47.208
Where's Dustin?

1:42:47.791 --> 1:42:48.875
God damn it!

1:42:48.958 --> 1:42:52.666
Dustin, you're wanted back on set.
Soon as you can make it, that'd be great.

1:42:52.750 --> 1:42:54.083
Fucking prick!

1:42:54.166 --> 1:42:56.500
Mr. Best, there's been a breach.

1:43:11.125 --> 1:43:13.291
I believe the children wanna play!

1:43:13.375 --> 1:43:15.458
Okay, let's have some fun.

1:43:16.291 --> 1:43:17.625
Can I leave?

1:43:17.708 --> 1:43:20.208
No! I'm sorry I'm not Patty Jenkins.

1:43:20.291 --> 1:43:22.666
I don't get to work
with fucking Cal Gadot.

1:43:22.750 --> 1:43:24.666
Gotta work with these fucks!

1:43:24.750 --> 1:43:28.208
<i>There's some really crazy shit going down</i>
<i>on the</i> Cliff Beasts <i>set right now.</i>

1:43:28.291 --> 1:43:30.333
<i>I don't even know where to begin.</i>

1:43:30.416 --> 1:43:33.041
<i>It's been really hard on set these days--</i>

1:43:38.500 --> 1:43:41.625
Hey! What's happening?
Has something gone wrong?

1:43:41.708 --> 1:43:42.666
Get out of my way.

1:43:42.750 --> 1:43:45.291
-Is there something we can do--
-To cheer them up?

1:43:45.375 --> 1:43:47.083
Cheer them up? This'll cheer them up!

1:43:47.166 --> 1:43:48.416
-This'll cheer them up!
-Whoa!

1:43:48.500 --> 1:43:50.083
-This'll cheer them up!
-Aah!

1:43:50.166 --> 1:43:51.875
What are you doing? Crikey!

1:43:51.958 --> 1:43:53.416
-Do you want cheering up?
-No, I'm--

1:43:53.500 --> 1:43:54.875
Do you want cheering up?

1:43:54.958 --> 1:43:56.250
I'm on a different film.

1:43:59.500 --> 1:44:02.458
-That slowed them down a bit.
-Three, four seconds. Yeah.

1:44:02.541 --> 1:44:04.375
What the hell was that?

1:44:04.458 --> 1:44:07.500
I'm stopping you.
You have a movie to finish.

1:44:07.583 --> 1:44:09.083
I thought you were my friend.

1:44:09.166 --> 1:44:11.958
I was <i>paid</i> to be your friend!

1:44:12.041 --> 1:44:13.958
They paid you?

1:44:14.041 --> 1:44:16.708
-I'm a mole!
-What are you talking about?

1:44:16.791 --> 1:44:20.583
And by the way, you are a mediocre dancer.

1:44:20.666 --> 1:44:22.375
That's my appeal, bitch!

1:44:25.916 --> 1:44:28.416
Aah!

1:44:30.166 --> 1:44:31.125
Come on.

1:44:34.458 --> 1:44:36.625
Hey. Hey, stop. Hey!

1:44:36.708 --> 1:44:39.041
Hey, why are you running?

1:44:40.416 --> 1:44:41.250
Hey!

1:44:41.958 --> 1:44:44.833
-Hey, stop!
-Why are you chasing me?

1:44:44.916 --> 1:44:47.333
-Why are you running?
-Get the hell away from me!

1:44:53.250 --> 1:44:54.958
God, get off of me!

1:44:58.166 --> 1:45:00.833
-Why were you running?
-Why do you care if I'm running?

1:45:00.916 --> 1:45:02.791
You could have stolen something.

1:45:02.875 --> 1:45:04.500
I didn't steal anything.

1:45:04.583 --> 1:45:07.375
I really don't think
you're allowed to run during a pandemic.

1:45:07.458 --> 1:45:09.208
I have to because it is an emergency.

1:45:09.291 --> 1:45:10.625
Ow!

1:45:10.708 --> 1:45:14.333
Great. I have a sore leg, and what do I
have to do for the rest of my day? Run.

1:45:14.416 --> 1:45:17.458
Aw! Somebody get Professor X
his wheelchair!

1:45:17.541 --> 1:45:20.916
I play a lot of different characters.
Not just him!

1:45:22.041 --> 1:45:23.458
-You're…
-Carol Cobb.

1:45:23.541 --> 1:45:25.583
-Carol Cobb.
-We went on a date, remember?

1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:28.250
Oh, wow.

1:45:28.333 --> 1:45:29.375
You don't remember--

1:45:29.458 --> 1:45:31.291
Oh. Hey, hi.

1:45:33.458 --> 1:45:37.041
-They need me back on set.
-Nobody's calling you. That's not a phone.

1:46:09.250 --> 1:46:10.916
There's my phone.

1:46:13.541 --> 1:46:15.583
Got you now, you dirty hippie.

1:46:19.708 --> 1:46:23.291
Hey, get your ass off the set!
What are you, crazy?

1:46:33.208 --> 1:46:34.416
Mr. Best!

1:46:35.541 --> 1:46:37.708
What? What is it, Gavin?

1:46:37.791 --> 1:46:39.625
What now?

1:46:39.708 --> 1:46:40.708
<i>Cliff Beasts!</i>

1:46:41.625 --> 1:46:42.583
Shit, it's in his hand!

1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.541
Can I be in <i>Cliff Beasts 7</i>
now I shot him for you?

1:46:47.625 --> 1:46:48.666
I'll make a call.

1:46:48.750 --> 1:46:50.791
Thank you.
Sorry about flipping out earlier.

1:46:50.875 --> 1:46:54.625
-There's a lot of stress and emotions.
-Just let me enjoy this moment.

1:47:11.166 --> 1:47:14.708
-Do you know how to fly that thing?
-Yeah, I took eight lessons.

1:47:15.250 --> 1:47:18.541
Hey! Where do you think
you're going? Huh?

1:47:21.083 --> 1:47:22.333
Don't move!

1:47:22.416 --> 1:47:23.250
Stay there!

1:47:24.291 --> 1:47:26.583
How do the brakes work on this thing?
God damn it.

1:47:26.666 --> 1:47:28.750
No one's getting in that helicopter!

1:47:29.833 --> 1:47:31.125
Turn around.

1:47:31.208 --> 1:47:33.250
Turn around, go back to set.

1:47:33.791 --> 1:47:37.416
I won Sundance
with a movie I made on my phone!

1:47:38.416 --> 1:47:39.833
An iPhone 6!

1:47:39.916 --> 1:47:41.750
I am not going back to my old life.

1:47:41.833 --> 1:47:44.916
You think I want to go back
to Home Depot, selling tiles?

1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:46.125
This is my shot!

1:47:46.208 --> 1:47:48.500
Your call time is right now!

1:47:48.583 --> 1:47:49.750
I got this.

1:47:50.833 --> 1:47:54.291
-You got what? This?
-You wanna go, Cimino?

1:47:54.375 --> 1:47:55.958
-Do I wanna go? Yeah.
-Come on.

1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:57.500
Come on.

1:47:57.583 --> 1:47:59.708
You wanna play around?
Is that what you want?

1:48:04.041 --> 1:48:04.875
Yeah.

1:48:07.875 --> 1:48:09.083
What are they doing?

1:48:09.666 --> 1:48:12.750
I'm pretty sure
it's the tribesmen fight from the movie.

1:48:12.833 --> 1:48:15.708
-Oh. This is a terrible fight.
-Go again?

1:48:15.791 --> 1:48:16.958
-All right.
-From the top?

1:48:17.041 --> 1:48:22.375
Grab. Block away, one punch,
second punch. Down, stomach. Duck.

1:48:22.458 --> 1:48:24.958
The fight I was just in
was way better than this.

1:48:25.041 --> 1:48:25.875
Oh.

1:48:25.958 --> 1:48:26.958
Attaboy.

1:48:27.041 --> 1:48:28.458
-Give me that!
-Yeah!

1:48:29.375 --> 1:48:30.625
Should we stop it?

1:48:31.625 --> 1:48:33.291
Probably not. No one's getting hurt.

1:48:36.708 --> 1:48:39.166
Shit! Dustin,
just do something different! Anything!

1:48:39.250 --> 1:48:41.708
All right. Here's a page one rewrite.

1:48:42.291 --> 1:48:43.125
On your balls!

1:48:43.208 --> 1:48:45.000
-There it is!

1:48:47.625 --> 1:48:49.791
-Yeah! That's different.
-Hit to the face!

1:48:53.375 --> 1:48:54.208
Yeah!

1:48:56.208 --> 1:48:58.458
-Attaboy, Dustin!
-Let's go.

1:49:01.458 --> 1:49:02.500
-Dieter!

1:49:02.583 --> 1:49:03.666
Dieter, come on!

1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:07.083
You should have gone with my pages.

1:49:09.708 --> 1:49:10.791
All right, now this…

1:49:11.583 --> 1:49:13.958
That's done. Okay, all right, this goes…

1:49:14.041 --> 1:49:15.333
Oh, my God.

1:49:17.666 --> 1:49:19.958
My cast!

1:49:21.416 --> 1:49:22.333
Anika,

1:49:23.208 --> 1:49:24.583
you made it okay!

1:49:24.666 --> 1:49:27.625
I got in here
three hours early just to be safe.

1:49:30.291 --> 1:49:33.916
I wanna live with you.
I wanna live with you in Beverly Hills.

1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.458
-I live in Sherman Oaks.
-Even better!

1:49:39.291 --> 1:49:40.500
-You got this?
-Yeah.

1:49:40.583 --> 1:49:42.750
-Whoo!
-No celebrating yet.

1:49:42.833 --> 1:49:44.666
-Okay, no, we--
-Fly it.

1:49:52.250 --> 1:49:54.416
Oh, man, this is a rush!

1:49:55.041 --> 1:49:55.958
All right!

1:49:57.083 --> 1:49:58.333
Yes!

1:50:01.666 --> 1:50:04.541
Whoo! Whoo!

1:50:08.916 --> 1:50:10.458
Why are we standing still?

1:50:10.541 --> 1:50:11.666
What are you doing?

1:50:12.291 --> 1:50:14.833
-Just hold on--
-Let's get going.

1:50:14.916 --> 1:50:17.250
Okay, just give me a second. Um…

1:50:17.833 --> 1:50:19.083
Okay, what is that one?

1:50:19.166 --> 1:50:21.875
I've not seen that button.
I do not know what that does.

1:50:22.458 --> 1:50:23.958
What happens now?

1:50:24.041 --> 1:50:27.416
You're definitely gonna get the sack
for getting Howie to shoot Mr. Best.

1:50:27.500 --> 1:50:31.291
You'll be in directors jail for the rest
of your life, if that. You're finished.

1:50:31.375 --> 1:50:34.958
And I'm just gonna take over as producer
and get the movie in the can.

1:50:37.875 --> 1:50:39.083
What are you doing?

1:50:39.166 --> 1:50:41.833
Uh, I only know how to go up and down.

1:50:41.916 --> 1:50:43.166
What?

1:50:43.250 --> 1:50:46.000
For the movie, they only taught me
how to go up and down.

1:50:46.083 --> 1:50:48.083
They didn't teach me how to go forward.

1:50:49.291 --> 1:50:51.875
I don't know how to move forward, okay?

1:50:51.958 --> 1:50:54.208
I'm just, uh…
I don't know what else to do.

1:50:55.541 --> 1:50:56.625
Just push it forward!

1:50:56.708 --> 1:51:01.541
Well, I don't know if that's how it works.
It might be how it works. I don't know!

1:51:01.625 --> 1:51:03.708
-Oh, my God.
-What is happening?

1:51:03.791 --> 1:51:07.416
Krystal, go on YouTube. See if there's
a helicopter tutorial or something!

1:51:07.500 --> 1:51:09.041
Does YouTube still exist?

1:51:09.125 --> 1:51:10.708
-Yes!
-Yes, YouTube exists!

1:51:10.791 --> 1:51:12.541
-It still exists!
-Okay!

1:51:13.125 --> 1:51:14.208
-Um…
-Hurry, Krystal.

1:51:17.125 --> 1:51:18.708
What? What are you looking at?

1:51:20.916 --> 1:51:24.041
It's a monkey
being washed in a sink.

1:51:24.125 --> 1:51:26.916
-It's taking a bath.
-What's happening?

1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.541
-It's a monkey.
-A monkey taking a bath?

1:51:29.625 --> 1:51:31.541
-Look, he's so cute!
-Let me see.

1:51:31.625 --> 1:51:33.125
I don't think he likes it!

1:51:33.208 --> 1:51:36.041
-Aw! His fur is so soapy!

1:51:38.625 --> 1:51:40.625
-Stop this!
-Stop!

1:51:42.166 --> 1:51:43.416
Krystal, show me!

1:51:43.500 --> 1:51:44.958
Hurry! Let's go!

1:51:45.041 --> 1:51:47.791
Stop yelling at me! Go, just watch it!

1:51:47.875 --> 1:51:50.625
<i>Today, I'd like to talk to you</i>
<i>about how to fly a helicopter.</i>

1:51:50.708 --> 1:51:53.083
<i>Why don't we hop in</i>
<i>and I'll show you how it works?</i>

1:51:57.333 --> 1:51:59.208
-What are you doing?
-Oh.

1:51:59.291 --> 1:52:00.625
It's a prop. It doesn't work.

1:52:00.708 --> 1:52:03.833
I just thought maybe
this could scare them into coming back.

1:52:07.916 --> 1:52:11.708
-Okay, I think I got it.
-Darren is pointing a gun at us right now!

1:52:11.791 --> 1:52:14.458
-Oh, my God! We gotta go. Go!
-Okay. Uh-huh.

1:52:21.958 --> 1:52:23.833
Sean, I believe in you.

1:52:24.416 --> 1:52:25.458
You can do this.

1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.416
I wanna be the hero, but I can't do it.

1:52:29.750 --> 1:52:31.541
Come on, guys, we're a family!

1:52:34.291 --> 1:52:35.750
Let's do this together.

1:52:38.666 --> 1:52:39.916
Come on.

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.750
All right. Okay, guys, here we go.

1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:47.916
We're doing it. We're doing it.
We're moving forward.

1:52:52.375 --> 1:52:54.958
No, we're good! We're good!
We're good! We're good!

1:52:55.583 --> 1:52:57.875
We're good. I've got it. Okay.

1:52:59.416 --> 1:53:01.916
So how are you doing?
This seems like a major setback.

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:05.333
We're gonna be fine! We'll put
a cut together. It's gonna be great.

1:53:06.125 --> 1:53:08.833
We're not done.
They'll probably come back!

1:53:13.791 --> 1:53:15.250
I think I got it, everyone.

1:53:16.500 --> 1:53:17.500
We're going home.

1:53:19.208 --> 1:53:22.333
You sons of bitches,
you didn't tip us!

1:53:22.416 --> 1:53:24.708
-Oh, my God!
-Bye-bye, Clifton!

1:53:24.791 --> 1:53:25.708
-Bye!
-Whoo-hoo!

1:53:58.041 --> 1:53:59.833
I'm Susan Howard, reporting live

1:53:59.916 --> 1:54:03.125
from the premiere of a documentary
about a disastrous production

1:54:03.208 --> 1:54:05.958
that the entire nation is talking about.

1:54:06.041 --> 1:54:07.458
I'm a beast!

1:54:07.541 --> 1:54:08.541
We're a beast!

1:54:08.625 --> 1:54:10.000
I'm a beast!

1:54:10.083 --> 1:54:12.458
-I'm a beast!
-I ain't a fucking cliff beast.

1:54:12.541 --> 1:54:15.833
-Let's get ready to bubble!
-Bubble!

1:54:18.333 --> 1:54:19.541
<i>Cliff Beasts 6?</i>

1:54:20.291 --> 1:54:21.458
Holy shit.

1:54:23.416 --> 1:54:27.458
When Howie cracked, that's when we all
should have just gotten out of there.

1:54:29.291 --> 1:54:33.166
And here's a warning. Do not leak this
on the Internet, you fucking idiots.

1:54:34.416 --> 1:54:36.875
-<i>The security was insane.</i>

1:54:36.958 --> 1:54:38.125
They had guns.

1:54:39.333 --> 1:54:42.875
It felt like America, but in England.

1:54:44.333 --> 1:54:48.666
The second these things go to streamers,
they're gonna be watched on televisions,

1:54:48.750 --> 1:54:50.708
and then that makes me a television star.

1:54:50.791 --> 1:54:53.333
I'm not a television star!
I am a movie star!

1:54:53.416 --> 1:54:55.166
What do you think I am? Young Sheldon?

1:54:56.750 --> 1:54:59.250
-No, don't leave me!
-Let go!

1:55:00.833 --> 1:55:03.666
Not now. Turn that off, you tit!

1:55:03.750 --> 1:55:06.125
Yeah, the cast all called me EPK Guy.

1:55:06.208 --> 1:55:09.125
It's like, "That's not my name.
My name is Scott."

1:55:09.208 --> 1:55:11.375
Now they know it.
It's on the fucking poster.

1:55:13.208 --> 1:55:16.500
How does it feel to be the villain
of <i>Beasts of the Bubble?</i>

1:55:16.583 --> 1:55:19.125
I'm not the villain.
What are you talking about?

1:55:19.208 --> 1:55:22.083
Why are you complaining?
I can't leave and have almost no lines.

1:55:22.166 --> 1:55:25.250
I'm over here with my dick in my hands
like a piece-of-shit extra!

1:55:25.333 --> 1:55:28.375
No, I didn't know that all my Zoom calls
were being recorded.

1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.416
I could sue, but I won't
'cause I'm in on the joke,

1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:33.625
and I love the joke.

1:55:33.708 --> 1:55:35.250
So you're the mole!

1:55:35.333 --> 1:55:37.083
I know! I'm the mole.

1:55:37.166 --> 1:55:39.500
I never thought it could work
as just a hand.

1:55:40.958 --> 1:55:41.875
High five.

1:55:42.541 --> 1:55:43.375
See?

1:55:45.833 --> 1:55:47.125
Sean, how are you doing?

1:55:47.208 --> 1:55:50.333
I heard you just got out of rehab
for cocaine addiction.

1:55:50.416 --> 1:55:54.875
Yes, two-day rehab. I walked in one day.
I said, "I think I'm addicted to cocaine."

1:55:54.958 --> 1:55:57.625
They said, "You shouldn't
do that anymore." I said, "Done."

1:55:57.708 --> 1:55:59.833
-Two days, huh?
-48 hours.

1:55:59.916 --> 1:56:01.416
What's your next project, Darren?

1:56:01.500 --> 1:56:03.083
I'm doing the Skittles movie.

1:56:03.166 --> 1:56:06.791
It's based on the candy.
It's got a great story. A passion project.

1:56:06.875 --> 1:56:12.000
And it's about racism and diversity,
and how we can all get along.

1:56:12.666 --> 1:56:15.625
It's all the flavors,
but it all goes under one name. Skittles.

1:56:15.708 --> 1:56:19.125
So much exciting news for the two of you.
And who's this?

1:56:19.833 --> 1:56:21.333
This is our friend, Kate.

1:56:21.958 --> 1:56:24.083
I have no idea why I'm here.

1:56:24.166 --> 1:56:25.250
Come on, Kate.

1:56:26.208 --> 1:56:27.041
Come on.

1:56:28.083 --> 1:56:29.250
I'm a beast!

1:56:29.333 --> 1:56:32.000
-Come on, Rafi, just say it with me.
-No, get off me!

1:56:33.708 --> 1:56:36.166
So how have you been doing
since the movie?

1:56:36.250 --> 1:56:37.333
Um, yeah, good.

1:56:37.416 --> 1:56:39.750
Um, so I'm worried
I'm gonna get in trouble

1:56:39.833 --> 1:56:42.875
because I didn't send
the swabs off to get tested.

1:56:42.958 --> 1:56:45.125
Um, so I've still got
most of them at home.

1:56:45.208 --> 1:56:48.708
And even now I don't really know
where to send them. If you know?

1:56:49.541 --> 1:56:50.958
No? Thank you.

1:57:00.291 --> 1:57:03.416
Do you think they have enough footage
in the can to put a cut together?

1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:05.583
We didn't get any of the opening,

1:57:05.666 --> 1:57:08.875
but maybe that doesn't matter
as long as the ending's strong.

1:57:08.958 --> 1:57:12.333
Yeah. The rest of the movie can be shit
as long as the ending's good

1:57:12.416 --> 1:57:14.666
'cause that's what they'll remember.
You know?

1:57:14.750 --> 1:57:15.583
Oh, yeah.

1:57:16.416 --> 1:57:18.916
Well, at least we tried to make a movie.

1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:20.583
They can't judge us for that.

1:57:20.666 --> 1:57:23.708
We made something that's a distraction
in these difficult times.

2:03:57.458 --> 2:03:59.958
It's really hard
to direct in these things.
