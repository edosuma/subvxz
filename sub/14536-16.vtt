WEBVTT

00:03.762 --> 00:05.353
You guys will
never believe this.

00:05.388 --> 00:07.914
After 20 years
of being overlooked,

00:07.949 --> 00:10.259
I have finally been
recognized by my peers

00:10.294 --> 00:12.460
at the Organization
and been nominated

00:12.495 --> 00:14.746
for an Orgi award!
Best Foreign Mission!

00:14.781 --> 00:17.282
What?!

00:17.317 --> 00:19.142
Okay, I know it's taken
a lotta time,

00:19.178 --> 00:22.855
but Best Foreign Mission, that's
the most prestigious category.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.190
People would kill
for that nomination.

00:25.267 --> 00:28.251
I'm pretty sure that's how
you get that nomination.

00:28.286 --> 00:31.405
It's taken a lot of
blood, sweat and tears,

00:31.482 --> 00:32.909
and most of those tears
are over it taking so long

00:32.933 --> 00:35.050
to be nominated.

00:35.085 --> 00:37.403
But, um, my time has come.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.028
That's my girl.

00:39.064 --> 00:41.573
Hey, guys. Guess what.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.617
I have been nominated
for an Orgi award.

00:45.403 --> 00:48.246
It's, like, Best Foreign Mission
or something like that.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.052
Can you believe it?

00:53.128 --> 00:55.119
After only one year
of being in the Organization.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.573
Must be like
beginner's luck or something.

00:57.608 --> 00:58.357
So you guys wanna celebrate
over some mac and cheese?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.392
Get out while you can.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.680
Why's everybody hatin' on
the mac and cheese?

01:09.119 --> 01:12.712
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:12.747 --> 01:15.908
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:15.984 --> 01:19.861
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:19.896 --> 01:23.882
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:23.918 --> 01:27.544
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:27.579 --> 01:29.637
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:29.673 --> 01:33.708
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

01:33.743 --> 01:37.645
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

01:37.681 --> 01:39.714
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

01:39.749 --> 01:41.992
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

01:42.027 --> 01:44.177
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

01:44.213 --> 01:46.288
¶ But I always got your back ¶

01:46.323 --> 01:48.215
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

01:48.250 --> 01:50.458
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

01:50.493 --> 01:53.095
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

01:53.130 --> 01:54.446
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

01:54.481 --> 01:56.807
I keep it undercover.

01:56.842 --> 01:57.842
I keep it undercover.

02:01.463 --> 02:04.039
Mom, is there a problem?

02:04.074 --> 02:05.390
No, there's no problem.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.975
Everything's fine.

02:07.010 --> 02:08.751
Right as rain,
couldn't be better.

02:08.787 --> 02:10.904
Hunky dory.

02:10.939 --> 02:12.906
Really? Because things
don't seem

02:12.941 --> 02:14.649
neither hunk nor dory.

02:14.685 --> 02:17.853
Everything's fine.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.225
But you're not the only one
nominated for Best Foreign Mission.

02:20.249 --> 02:21.623
Oh, really? Dad got nominated?

02:21.658 --> 02:22.807
No. Me!

02:22.842 --> 02:25.335
Oh. Mom, that's awesome.

02:25.370 --> 02:28.196
The Cooper ladies representin'.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.415
You don't seem
too happy about that.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.967
- I'm happy.
- You don't look happy.

02:32.002 --> 02:33.435
I'm happy.
You don't sound happy.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.111
I'm happy, okay?

02:35.146 --> 02:38.757
I'm very, very happy.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.859
You might wanna text your face
and let it know,

02:40.894 --> 02:44.037
'cause right now, you look
a little grrrr.

02:44.072 --> 02:46.323
I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:46.358 --> 02:49.835
Mom, would you like me to
decline the nomination?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.011
No. I would never
ask you to do that.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.365
That would make me
a terrible mother

02:53.389 --> 02:56.449
and a horrible human being.

02:56.485 --> 02:58.685
There's no reason why
you should drop out.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.045
Unless you want to.

03:01.665 --> 03:04.391
Or you love me.

03:04.468 --> 03:06.710
Mom, that was a test,
and you failed miserably.

03:06.745 --> 03:08.445
No, I'm not dropping out.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.196
You know what? Fine.

03:10.232 --> 03:13.783
Fine. Then try not to be
a sore loser.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.294
I don't really know
what type of loser I'd be,

03:16.329 --> 03:18.471
because I've never really
lost at anything.

03:18.507 --> 03:20.393
I also don't know what
it's like to not be nominated,

03:20.417 --> 03:22.137
but I'm sure you could
tell me all about it.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.116
( Inhaling loudly )

03:36.408 --> 03:37.649
Come on, baby.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.559
Nice tuxedo, Dad.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.802
Thank you.

03:40.838 --> 03:42.612
Whose is it?

03:42.647 --> 03:44.155
What are you talking about?

03:44.190 --> 03:46.065
This is mine.
Wore it to my wedding.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.076
Oh, really? Did it fit then?

03:48.111 --> 03:50.261
I happen to think
it looks great,

03:50.296 --> 03:52.380
considering I've had
two kids since then.

03:52.416 --> 03:56.176
You do know how having
kids actually works, right, Dad?

03:56.211 --> 03:58.461
You wouldn't be here
if I didn't.

03:58.497 --> 04:00.622
Looking good, Mom.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.065
Thank you.

04:04.068 --> 04:06.419
Wow! You look fantastic!

04:06.455 --> 04:08.088
Thank you. And I like your tux.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.056
Thank you.

04:10.091 --> 04:12.868
Does it come in your size?

04:12.903 --> 04:14.777
It is my size.

04:14.812 --> 04:16.362
Almost.

04:16.397 --> 04:18.915
Listen.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.712
I love you, sweetheart,
but you've been a little nasty

04:20.736 --> 04:23.303
since those nominations
came out.

04:23.338 --> 04:25.238
I want you to put
a smile on your face,

04:25.273 --> 04:26.806
and go make up
with your daughter.

04:26.841 --> 04:27.916
Can you do that for me?

04:27.951 --> 04:29.884
All right, Craig.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.319
I have been acting
like an idiot,

04:31.355 --> 04:32.945
competing with my own daughter.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.406
I should be ashamed of myself.

04:35.442 --> 04:39.010
Hey, KC honey, I love you.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.762
Will you come down here
so I can apologize?

04:40.797 --> 04:42.355
Coming.

04:42.391 --> 04:44.991
Okay, so I'll apologize,

04:45.027 --> 04:45.900
and then the whole family will
go out and have a good time.

04:45.936 --> 04:47.444
That's what I'm talking...

04:51.408 --> 04:53.241
What the heck
do you think you're wearing?

04:53.276 --> 04:56.278
A dress suitable for
a 16-year-old girl.

04:56.313 --> 04:58.613
And what are you wearing?

04:58.648 --> 05:00.640
My new dress. I just bought it.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.667
At what store?
Forever Inappropriate?

05:06.456 --> 05:08.076
What'd you say, Ernie?
Need help with your bowtie?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.276
Yeah, I'll be right
up there, buddy.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.301
Mom, what is your deal?

05:12.337 --> 05:13.995
Oh, KC, I'm embarrassed.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.483
I don't know why
I'm acting like this.

05:15.507 --> 05:17.065
Honey, I really am proud of you,

05:17.100 --> 05:19.192
and you deserve to win.

05:19.227 --> 05:20.387
And you know what? When you do,

05:20.411 --> 05:21.294
I will be cheering
louder than anyone,

05:21.330 --> 05:23.629
because I love you.

05:23.665 --> 05:25.490
You're my baby girl.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.950
( Retching )

05:26.985 --> 05:28.801
All right, point taken.

05:28.836 --> 05:29.956
I laid it on a little thick.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.746
But I meant it.

05:31.782 --> 05:32.972
( Vomiting )

05:33.008 --> 05:35.241
KC, are you okay?

05:35.276 --> 05:39.746
Yeah. Suddenly I felt
a little sick to my stomach.

05:39.781 --> 05:41.350
It sounds like you have food poisoning.
What did you eat?

05:41.374 --> 05:44.016
Just that pasta that...

05:44.052 --> 05:48.630
- you made me.
- What are you saying?

05:48.665 --> 05:51.069
I'm saying you did this to me.
You poisoned your own daughter.

05:51.093 --> 05:53.676
KC, do you honestly believe
that I would ever poison anyone?

05:53.711 --> 05:56.679
Well, you did it to the enemy
agent in Luxembourg.

05:56.714 --> 05:58.714
It's how you got the nomination
in the first place.

06:00.001 --> 06:01.660
You made me sick to my stomach.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.069
Literally.

06:03.105 --> 06:04.454
( Vomiting )

06:04.489 --> 06:05.930
Oh, honey.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.482
Okay.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.998
Yuck. I can't believe
I'm nominated

06:15.033 --> 06:17.133
in the gadget category.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.521
I thought it was an honor
just to be nominated.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.654
Please. I've competed against

06:20.689 --> 06:22.497
an I Heart New York
bottle opener

06:22.532 --> 06:24.540
and a stapler.

06:24.575 --> 06:27.777
Me, the world's most
sophisticated robot,

06:27.812 --> 06:30.771
up against things
you find in a junk drawer.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.149
At least it's better
than my category.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.377
Not nominated at all.

06:36.413 --> 06:39.806
Those are the nominees
for Best Supporting Spy.

06:39.842 --> 06:41.316
What do they have that I don't?

06:41.351 --> 06:43.468
Skills, looks, a personality,

06:43.503 --> 06:45.494
the ability to grow facial hair.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.146
Okay, Judy, enough. I get it.

06:47.182 --> 06:48.773
A sense of style, girlfriends,

06:48.809 --> 06:50.091
a functioning pituitary gland.

06:50.127 --> 06:52.043
Want me to go on?

06:52.079 --> 06:55.338
Suddenly, I'm not sure
I want to go on.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.983
I feel awful about KC.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.729
I mean, here I am
at this fancy awards dinner,

07:00.753 --> 07:03.512
and she's at home feeling sick,
thinking the worst of me.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.724
Come on, Kira,
it's just the two of us.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.492
Did you poison her?

07:07.527 --> 07:10.386
Did you?

07:10.422 --> 07:12.664
Of course not.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.049
I swear on your tight tux.

07:14.084 --> 07:16.375
It's not tight.

07:16.411 --> 07:18.171
Just cuttin' off
my circulation a little bit.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.374
( Feedback whines )

07:23.409 --> 07:26.302
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

07:26.338 --> 07:28.605
and welcome to
the 30th annual Orgi awards.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.470
I'm television's Buck Marshall,

07:35.505 --> 07:38.172
host of<i> Fly Fishing</i>
<i>With Buck Marshall,</i>

07:38.208 --> 07:41.184
<i>Tales From the Morgue
With Buck Marshall,</i>

07:41.219 --> 07:42.785
and my brand-new game show,

07:42.820 --> 07:45.021
<i>Pass the Buck With...</i>
you guessed it

07:45.057 --> 07:46.057
<i>Buck Marshall.</i>

07:48.351 --> 07:50.218
I'm told that this is
the third time

07:50.253 --> 07:51.944
that I've hosted these awards,

07:51.979 --> 07:53.738
although for the life of me,

07:53.773 --> 07:56.582
I don't have
a single memory of it.

07:56.618 --> 07:58.418
I could say the same
for my second marriage.

07:58.453 --> 08:00.712
( Rim shot, audience laughter )

08:00.747 --> 08:03.631
He used that same joke
last year.

08:03.667 --> 08:06.059
Maybe tonight, they can
erase our memory instead of his.

08:10.849 --> 08:13.166
Don't worry, KC.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.161
¶ Marisa is here ¶

08:16.196 --> 08:18.221
I will nurse you back to health.

08:18.256 --> 08:20.874
Marisa, just because
you skip class

08:22.677 --> 08:24.530
and sdoes not make you time
in an actual nurse. Ce,

08:24.554 --> 08:26.487
Besides, you hate
being around sick people.

08:26.523 --> 08:29.115
Yes, except when I have
a huge test coming up

08:29.150 --> 08:31.334
that I didn't study for.

08:31.369 --> 08:33.049
So just sit there
and breathe on me, sicky.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.398
Marisa, you do realize
you can't catch food poisoning.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.575
Well, not with
that attitude, you can't.

08:39.610 --> 08:41.536
Now come on, throw up on me.

08:41.571 --> 08:42.679
Less yappin', more yackin'.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.652
Marisa, all I wanna do
is drink some of my tea,

08:48.654 --> 08:51.980
keep it inside of my body,
and go back to sleep.

08:52.015 --> 08:53.022
Let me help you.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.365
And now,

09:02.400 --> 09:05.026
nominees for Best Performance
On A Foreign Mission...

09:05.061 --> 09:06.677
This is it, this is it.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.753
Whitney Larson for Canada.

09:10.224 --> 09:11.624
Harris Russo for Estonia.

09:15.071 --> 09:16.871
KC Cooper for Monrovia.

09:16.906 --> 09:20.132
Hey...

09:20.168 --> 09:22.576
And Kira Cooper for Luxembourg.

09:22.612 --> 09:23.845
All right!

09:26.516 --> 09:29.642
And the Orgi award goes to...

09:37.293 --> 09:39.694
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:43.325 --> 09:47.168
Folks, I don't think
this is part of the program.

09:47.245 --> 09:49.678
Truth be told, I didn't go
to the tech rehearsal

09:49.714 --> 09:51.605
because you people
don't pay enough.

09:51.641 --> 09:54.917
What is goin' on?!

09:54.953 --> 09:56.803
I'll tell you what's goin' on.

09:56.838 --> 09:59.789
Nobody's going anywhere.

09:59.824 --> 10:01.449
This is not good.

10:01.485 --> 10:03.401
Tell me about it.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.536
I was just about
to go to the bathroom.

10:05.571 --> 10:07.680
All your weapons
have been disabled.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.769
My people are coming around
to collect your devices...

10:13.804 --> 10:16.447
Phones, laser guns,
earrings, all of it.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.900
Bup-bup-bup.

10:18.935 --> 10:20.895
Hand over that wig, lady.
It's not my first rodeo.

10:28.010 --> 10:30.870
All right, now let's
make this easy.

10:30.905 --> 10:33.673
I'm looking for the agent
who put away my father,

10:33.708 --> 10:36.209
Tony "The Big Toe" Tolentino.

10:36.244 --> 10:39.137
That's right.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.880
I'm Tony "The Big Toe" Junior.

10:40.915 --> 10:42.857
Big Toe Junior.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.667
Wouldn't that make him
the little toe?

10:44.703 --> 10:46.303
No, that does not
make me the little toe!

10:47.830 --> 10:49.681
I resent that insinuation.

10:51.809 --> 10:54.352
So which one of you
is Agent 8433599?

10:57.190 --> 11:00.241
Okay, fine.

11:00.277 --> 11:02.710
I'll question each one of you
until I find out who it is.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.146
No one's going
to tell you anything,

11:04.172 --> 11:06.313
so do your worst.

11:06.349 --> 11:08.082
These agents have been
trained to withstand

11:08.117 --> 11:10.276
- incredible physical pain.
- We have?

11:10.311 --> 11:13.246
Were you not trained yet?

11:13.281 --> 11:14.841
Yeah, you're not gonna
like this at all.

11:17.969 --> 11:21.837
If Agent 8433599
doesn't come forward,

11:21.872 --> 11:26.033
we'll start eliminating you
one by one,

11:26.069 --> 11:28.794
starting with her.

11:28.830 --> 11:30.282
Great. They're starting
with Whitney Larson.

11:30.306 --> 11:32.891
My odds just got better.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.777
Kira!

11:35.854 --> 11:38.688
We need to contact KC
and let her know we need help.

11:38.723 --> 11:41.957
But his device shut down
all outgoing communication.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.360
Not when you have
your own built-in satellite.

11:44.395 --> 11:46.070
Take that, I Heart New York
bottle opener.

11:53.964 --> 11:57.356
KC, someone's put
the Orgi awards on lockdown.

11:57.391 --> 11:59.642
We need you to get us out.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.928
Help us, KC Cooper.

12:01.963 --> 12:03.404
You're our only hope.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.373
My family needs me.

12:05.408 --> 12:07.475
I'm strong, I'm focused,

12:07.510 --> 12:08.962
- I'm invincible.
- ( stomach rumbling )

12:08.986 --> 12:10.826
I'm gonna need your help
to get off this couch.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.198
Marisa, could you please
just pick a lane, please?

12:22.233 --> 12:23.666
Fine. I pick this one.

12:23.701 --> 12:27.211
( Groaning )

12:27.246 --> 12:31.824
And unfortunately, my stomach
is left in the other lane.

12:31.859 --> 12:33.893
Marisa, could you please
just chill it out?

12:33.928 --> 12:36.304
I don't know why I didn't
pass my road test

12:36.339 --> 12:38.757
the first two times.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.639
Those guys at the DMV
must've had it out for me.

12:42.712 --> 12:45.004
Pick up the pace, grandpa.
We got lives to save.

12:50.494 --> 12:51.803
Psst.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.598
Ooh, child.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.860
Dad, it's getting dangerous.
I know.

13:07.896 --> 13:09.362
We can't wait around anymore.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.797
I'm goin' in.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.858
( laughing )

13:13.893 --> 13:16.452
Bless you, Ernie.

13:16.487 --> 13:18.307
I can always count on you to make
a joke and lighten the mood.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.323
I'm serious.

13:21.359 --> 13:23.885
If I can be a hero in front of
the entire Organization,

13:23.962 --> 13:26.504
then I'll finally get
the recognition I deserve.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.022
How about you get recognized
as the guy who sat there

13:29.058 --> 13:30.077
and didn't do anything stupid?

13:30.101 --> 13:31.801
That's an order, son.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.358
All right, we can't wait around any longer.
I'm goin' in.

13:39.393 --> 13:41.911
Goin' in was my idea.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.849
Stop trying to take
credit for everything, Ernie.

13:43.873 --> 13:44.900
No wonder they didn't
nominate you.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.204
They didn't nominate you either.

13:48.411 --> 13:49.869
Look here.

13:49.904 --> 13:51.537
I think you need
to grab your men

13:51.572 --> 13:53.088
and get outta here right now.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.683
- Oh, you want us to leave.
- Yeah.

13:55.718 --> 13:58.019
Okay. Pack it up, boys.
We're leaving,

13:58.054 --> 14:00.446
'cause this guy asked
us nicely, you know/

14:00.481 --> 14:03.441
Go scratch, man.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.477
Okay. I'm only gonna
say this once,

14:06.512 --> 14:09.380
and for your sake, I hope you're listening.
( Grunts )

14:09.415 --> 14:13.901
I have 50 sticks of dynamite
underneath this tuxedo.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.604
I don't believe you could
fit 50 sticks of gum

14:16.639 --> 14:18.139
underneath that tuxedo.

14:20.919 --> 14:23.995
If your brilliant plan
is to save everyone

14:24.030 --> 14:26.322
by blowing them up,

14:26.399 --> 14:27.567
you're definitely not
the agent I'm looking for.

14:27.591 --> 14:29.317
So...

14:31.145 --> 14:33.321
Well, I tried.

14:40.763 --> 14:42.380
All right, Marisa, I'm in,

14:42.415 --> 14:43.823
and I'm feeling better.

14:43.858 --> 14:45.967
I think I'm all puked out.

14:46.044 --> 14:49.103
Thanks for doing doughnuts
in the parking garage.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.050
Marisa, I need you to pull up
the building's schematics,

14:51.074 --> 14:53.099
and find me a way
to get to the ballroom.

14:53.176 --> 14:55.893
KC, I don't know how
to bring up the schematics.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.754
Frankly, I'm not really sure
what the word schematics means,

14:58.790 --> 15:00.830
but if it's anything like
mathematics, not your gal.

15:02.051 --> 15:03.492
Oh, I did it.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.653
I did it!

15:05.730 --> 15:07.624
Great. That's great.
Can you tell me where to go?

15:07.648 --> 15:10.299
Well, according to this map,

15:10.334 --> 15:12.785
you should go find someone
who knows how to read a map.

15:12.820 --> 15:15.846
Marisa, you can do this.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.182
Okay, um, just pretend like

15:18.217 --> 15:21.343
the ballroom is
a cute boy's bedroom.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.754
Okay? And his parents are in
the living room watching TV.

15:23.789 --> 15:26.056
What are they watching?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.917
<i>Jeopardy,</i> okay?
They're watching<i> Jeopardy.</i>

15:27.952 --> 15:30.136
And he's not allowed
to have anyone over

15:30.213 --> 15:33.097
- Why?
- Because he called his sister a butt face.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.566
<i>- He sounds like...</i>
- No.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.403
He's not anti-women,
he's just anti his sister.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.806
Okay? Now tell me how
to get to his room. Go.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.442
Okay, okay, yes.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.868
Use the fire escape
and go up to the second floor,

15:46.904 --> 15:48.295
make sure the coast is clear.

15:48.330 --> 15:50.055
Oh, and take off your shoes

15:50.091 --> 15:51.618
so his parents don't hear
your footsteps.

15:51.642 --> 15:54.394
Rookie mistake.

15:54.429 --> 15:55.877
Now there should be an air vent

15:55.913 --> 15:58.072
thirty paces to your left.

15:58.107 --> 16:00.182
Wow!

16:00.218 --> 16:01.909
Spy stuff is fun.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.681
<i>- Oh, no, to your right, to your right.</i>
- Girl!

16:07.717 --> 16:10.226
Okay now shimmy shimmy
ten more feet,

16:10.261 --> 16:13.054
<i>and then, you can drop down
into the utility closet</i>

16:13.131 --> 16:15.011
<i>near the secret
back entrance to the ballroom.</i>

16:18.970 --> 16:20.564
You mean to tell me there's
a secret back entrance

16:20.588 --> 16:22.522
to the ballroom?

16:22.557 --> 16:23.617
Why am I crawling through
an air vent?

16:23.641 --> 16:25.950
What is wrong with you?

16:25.986 --> 16:29.779
Um, I don't know.
Maybe it's that I'm not a spy.

16:29.814 --> 16:32.365
<i>Now you crawl on your belly,</i>

16:32.442 --> 16:35.084
and get to that cute boy's
room before another girl

16:35.120 --> 16:36.514
sends him a text,
and the next thing you know,

16:36.538 --> 16:38.712
he's taking Heather Watson
to the Spring Fling,

16:38.747 --> 16:40.525
and you've got nothing better
to do on a Saturday night

16:40.549 --> 16:42.116
than try to catch
food poisoning.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.566
What?!

16:50.601 --> 16:53.001
I get hungry
when I'm under pressure.

16:53.037 --> 16:55.337
Your tuxedo must be starving.

16:58.501 --> 17:01.001
Hey, Little Big Toe, why don't
you interrogate this one next?

17:01.037 --> 17:02.631
I think there's a good chance
Big Mouth here

17:02.655 --> 17:04.388
is Agent 8433599.

17:07.351 --> 17:08.912
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
the agent I'm looking for

17:08.936 --> 17:10.820
isn't nine years old.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.505
Have you checked your eyebrows?

17:12.540 --> 17:13.625
Maybe the agent you're
looking for

17:13.649 --> 17:14.649
is camping out in there.

17:17.686 --> 17:19.954
All right, come on.
It's time to interrogate the one

17:20.031 --> 17:22.156
that's dressed like
Taylor Swift's little sister.

17:22.191 --> 17:25.034
( Stammering )

17:25.069 --> 17:28.421
First of all, this dress
is appropriate for any age,

17:28.456 --> 17:32.617
if you have the legs for it,
and I do.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.468
Now get down
and call off your goons.

17:34.504 --> 17:36.144
( Chuckles )

17:36.180 --> 17:38.514
Okay, I really don't see
what's so funny.

17:38.549 --> 17:40.808
The laser guns we use,

17:40.843 --> 17:42.426
they're activated by
our fingerprints.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.078
So go ahead. Pull the trigger.

17:45.114 --> 17:46.472
See what happens.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.726
- ( Clicking )
- Oh, thank goodness.

17:53.397 --> 17:55.357
The fingerprint technology
is still in beta phase.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.927
But with that kind of bravery,

17:59.962 --> 18:01.695
maybe you're Agent 8433599.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.127
Yeah, there's no way
she won that award.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.676
But you know what? She does have
the legs to pull off the dress.

18:23.619 --> 18:26.136
Oh, hey.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.171
Um, I think I may be
in the wrong place.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.887
Is this not
Kevin Finkelberg's bar mitzvah?

18:31.260 --> 18:32.693
Oh, man, this is awkward.

18:32.728 --> 18:34.336
My bad. You know what?

18:34.371 --> 18:36.972
It's all right.
Don't worry about me.

18:37.007 --> 18:39.727
- I'll just find my way out.
- I think you're right where you belong.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.470
At least, now you are.

18:43.506 --> 18:46.048
KC, are you okay?

18:46.084 --> 18:48.250
I wish I could see
what was going on.

18:48.285 --> 18:52.680
Wait a second. I think I can...

18:52.715 --> 18:54.873
The live video feed.

18:54.909 --> 18:57.927
Oh, I got the live video feed.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.029
Oh, oh, oh. This is not
looking good for you, KC.

19:01.065 --> 19:02.806
Oh, I can't watch.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.992
How do I shut this off?

19:05.027 --> 19:06.927
Oh, uh, lighting controls.
What does that do?

19:09.848 --> 19:12.008
That's right, bad guys.

19:12.043 --> 19:15.111
How about a little
mood lighting?

19:15.188 --> 19:17.082
While we're at it,
how about a little mood music?

19:17.106 --> 19:19.773
( Dance music plays )

19:27.525 --> 19:29.090
Oh!

19:29.126 --> 19:31.476
Sit down. I'm still in charge.

19:31.512 --> 19:32.319
Don't you hurt KC.

19:32.354 --> 19:33.921
Oh, KC.

19:33.956 --> 19:36.924
Don't you mean Agent 8433599?

19:36.959 --> 19:40.102
Yep. You figured it out.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.853
I'm the one who put
your father away

19:41.889 --> 19:43.292
'cause he was a lowlife,
just like you.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.100
I'm Agent 8433599.

19:46.177 --> 19:48.477
I'm gonna do something
actually worth nominating.

19:48.513 --> 19:51.038
She's lying.

19:51.074 --> 19:55.125
I'm Agent 8433599.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.170
They're both lying.
I'm Agent 8433599.

19:58.205 --> 20:00.814
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't steal my hero moment.

20:00.850 --> 20:04.326
<i>I'm</i> Agent 8433599.

20:04.361 --> 20:08.747
No, I'm Agent 8433599.

20:08.782 --> 20:11.675
No, I'm Agent 8433599.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.863
ALL: No, I'm Agent 8433599.

20:15.898 --> 20:17.289
Enough!

20:22.096 --> 20:26.340
For the record, I am not
Agent 8433599.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.819
Hey, Dad, flex your guns.

20:30.855 --> 20:31.973
I don't have any weapons, KC.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.389
No, not that kind of gun.

20:33.424 --> 20:35.241
The gun show.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.852
Oh, yeah.

20:37.887 --> 20:39.353
How about that?

20:44.652 --> 20:46.126
Thanks, Dad.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.242
Oh, by the way, killer tux.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.741
Well, don't forget to say
hello to your father

20:52.777 --> 20:54.217
for me in prison, Little Toe,

20:54.253 --> 20:55.853
'cause you're going away
for a long time.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.690
KC, I'm really sorry
for the way I acted.

21:08.726 --> 21:12.687
I guess seeing you
nominated your very first year,

21:12.763 --> 21:14.813
and your being so young
and having your whole life

21:14.848 --> 21:16.865
and career ahead of you,

21:16.901 --> 21:19.743
I don't know, honey,
it just made me feel so...

21:19.778 --> 21:22.754
so... old.

21:22.790 --> 21:26.541
Mom, old? Really?

21:26.577 --> 21:29.478
You just saved every agent
in the Organization,

21:29.514 --> 21:31.433
and you did it wearing
a cocktail dress and stilettos.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.040
Mom, you're not getting older.

21:33.075 --> 21:35.042
You're getting better.

21:35.077 --> 21:37.060
Oh, honey, thank you.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.004
Look, even if I win tonight,

21:39.039 --> 21:40.881
I'm gonna give you the award.

21:40.916 --> 21:42.658
Because you deserve it.

21:42.693 --> 21:44.376
And I'm proud of you, kid.

21:47.422 --> 21:49.674
Welcome back, everyone.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.475
It's starting.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.577
Craig, come over here.

21:53.613 --> 21:57.181
Now where were we?

21:57.216 --> 22:01.986
Oh, yes, the Best Performance
For A Foreign Mission.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.438
And the Orgi award goes to...

22:05.474 --> 22:07.691
- Kira Cooper!
- Yes!

22:12.381 --> 22:15.841
¶ I won, I won,
and you lost, and you lost ¶

22:15.876 --> 22:17.076
Yes, yes!

22:19.213 --> 22:21.254
Thank you, thank you.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.390
Oh, my gosh.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.042
This was totally unexpected.

22:28.288 --> 22:30.456
I mean, I never thought
that I would win.

22:30.491 --> 22:34.360
But, um, this isn't
just about me.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.745
No. Um...

22:36.780 --> 22:40.415
I'd like to dedicate
this award to

22:40.450 --> 22:43.844
all the bad guys
whose butts I kicked

22:43.879 --> 22:46.530
to make this award possible!
Yes!

22:46.565 --> 22:49.624
Thank you, thank you!

22:49.660 --> 22:52.953
Uh, Mom, I think you
forgot to mention someone.

22:52.988 --> 22:56.047
Look what I did! Yes!

22:56.083 --> 22:57.616
You are comin' home to Mama!

23:00.488 --> 23:02.963
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
