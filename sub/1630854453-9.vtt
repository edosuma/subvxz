The L Word: Generation Q...</i>

00:07.507 --> 00:10.093
<i>I can't do anything
that's too...</i>

00:10.093 --> 00:12.679
<i>real right now.</i>

00:12.679 --> 00:13.847
Okay.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.932
<i>What the actual fuck, Taylor?</i>

00:15.932 --> 00:17.183
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:17.183 --> 00:19.144
<i>Yeah, I am, too.</i>

00:19.144 --> 00:22.731
<i>By the way, he dies in the end!
- Oh, come on, lady!</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:25.525
<i>You want to start your new life?</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:27.527
<i>Call this exactly what it was.</i>

00:27.527 --> 00:28.820
<i>An awakening.</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:30.697
<i>For both of us.</i>

00:30.697 --> 00:32.657
<i>Fuck. Oh, my God.
- What?</i>

00:32.657 --> 00:34.200
It's someone I dated, briefly.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.202
<i>Bum-ba-dum-ba-dum, bum...</i>

00:36.202 --> 00:37.579
<i>Hey, hey.
Grab your shit. Come on.</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:39.664
<i>I love you, but I am not</i>

00:39.664 --> 00:41.374
<i>my full self
when I'm with you, Finn.</i>

00:41.374 --> 00:43.918
<i>I am on my own path,</i>

00:43.918 --> 00:45.211
<i>I am taking swings.</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:48.006
<i>My mom died.</i>

00:48.006 --> 00:50.050
I'd like another chance.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.844
<i>And I-I want to earn
your trust back.</i>

00:52.844 --> 00:54.429
<i>I can't do this
back-and-forth, I just,</i>

00:54.429 --> 00:55.555
<i>I need to get off
this fucking ride.</i>

00:55.555 --> 00:56.806
Are you okay?

00:56.806 --> 00:58.391
<i>No, I think I need to lie--</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:00.018
<i>Hey. Carrie. Carrie!</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:01.394
<i>Yeah, trouble finds me</i>

01:03.229 --> 01:04.731
<i>Her heart rate
is dropping, we're losing her.</i>

01:04.731 --> 01:06.566
Starting compressions.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.901
<i>I need epinephrine
and bicarbonate going in, now!</i>

01:09.861 --> 01:13.073
<i>- Stay with me.
- In your corner...</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:15.742
<i>She's stabilizing.</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:17.535
<i>I've got a pulse.
- She's gonna make it.</i>

01:17.535 --> 01:18.912
<i>Get her to CCU for observation.</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:20.413
See, she's not dead.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.041
<i>Next season, she has an affair
with a patient</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:24.209
<i>and she goes completely coocoo.</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:26.336
<i>Okay.</i>

01:26.336 --> 01:28.338
<i>Have many times have you seen
this show all the way through?</i>

01:29.756 --> 01:31.633
<i>I don't really want
to answer that question.</i>

01:31.633 --> 01:32.926
<i>Okay.
- All right?</i>

01:32.926 --> 01:33.927
<i>Let's just say a lot.</i>

01:33.927 --> 01:35.095
<i>Uh-huh.
- Hey.</i>

01:35.095 --> 01:36.596
<i>Hey.
- Hey.</i>

01:36.596 --> 01:38.389
<i>Hey, what did we say
about starting the day</i>

01:38.389 --> 01:40.058
<i>with a balanced breakfast
and a little movement?</i>

01:40.058 --> 01:41.643
<i>Well, we have said nothing,</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:43.478
<i>but you apparently
have said a lot.</i>

01:43.478 --> 01:46.106
<i>Okay, well, the doctor said
you got to get your steps in.</i>

01:46.106 --> 01:47.774
<i>We're trying to heal here.</i>

01:47.774 --> 01:48.817
Yeah, it's only been a week

01:48.817 --> 01:49.776
<i>since your heart attack, babe.</i>

01:49.776 --> 01:51.277
<i>Oh, I find Grey's Anatomy</i>

01:51.277 --> 01:52.946
<i>very healing, you know?</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:54.239
<i>It's gotten me through some
really rough patches</i>

01:54.239 --> 01:55.824
<i>in my life.
- Thank you. That's nice.</i>

01:55.824 --> 01:57.158
<i>Well...
-</i>

01:57.158 --> 01:58.827
<i>Ah, come on.
- That can be your reward</i>

01:58.827 --> 02:00.703
<i>for doing
your stress test today.</i>

02:00.703 --> 02:02.622
<i>Yeah?
- Yep, we got a quarter mile</i>

02:02.622 --> 02:04.916
<i>up an incline, baby.
- Ugh.</i>

02:04.916 --> 02:06.793
<i>Yes, we have to do that.
We're doing that today.</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:08.128
<i>Yeah.
- All right.</i>

02:08.128 --> 02:09.129
<i>Then you can do
anything you want.</i>

02:09.129 --> 02:10.046
<i>Yep.
- Including Misty.</i>

02:10.046 --> 02:11.297
Ooh.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.258
<i>Sex as motivation.
I like that. Yes?</i>

02:13.258 --> 02:14.926
<i>Hey!
- The two of you</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:16.636
<i>are really bad, you know that?</i>

02:16.636 --> 02:18.638
<i>Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God.</i>

02:18.638 --> 02:20.640
<i>Ugh. Ugh. This is not eggs.</i>

02:20.640 --> 02:21.975
<i>No, it's tofu.</i>

02:21.975 --> 02:24.269
<i>Yeah? Well, tofu...
fuck yourself.</i>

02:24.269 --> 02:26.563
<i>No wonder I've never
had it before.</i>

02:26.563 --> 02:27.939
<i>I'm a lunatic</i>

02:27.939 --> 02:28.982
<i>I'm a bitch</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:30.316
<i>I'm-a, I'm-a, I'm-a</i>

02:30.316 --> 02:31.901
<i>Light up all your shit</i>

02:31.901 --> 02:33.278
<i>Blow a kiss like</i>

02:33.278 --> 02:34.988
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:36.823
<i>- I'm a lunatic
- Whoa-oh-oh</i>

02:36.823 --> 02:38.283
<i>I'm-a, I'm-a, I'm-a</i>

02:38.283 --> 02:40.994
<i>I'm a lunatic,
I'm a bitch...</i>

02:43.121 --> 02:44.497
I think that's a great idea.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.499
Yeah.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.542
<i>It's nice to know that
I can always depend on you.</i>

02:50.003 --> 02:52.505
<i>- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.</i>

02:52.505 --> 02:54.007
<i>Fuck you.
-</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:56.009
<i>Hey. I was hoping
for chicken nuggets</i>

02:56.009 --> 02:57.969
<i>but all they had was something
called a "fish cake,"</i>

02:57.969 --> 02:59.846
<i>so proceed with caution.</i>

02:59.846 --> 03:02.140
<i>I'm not hungry, but thanks.</i>

03:03.224 --> 03:05.977
G, this has to stop.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.646
<i>Get your sorry ass out of bed,
put on some clothes,</i>

03:08.646 --> 03:10.857
<i>and get to your reading.</i>

03:10.857 --> 03:12.025
<i>I'm not going.</i>

03:12.025 --> 03:13.359
<i>Hendrix can fail me if he wants,</i>

03:13.359 --> 03:15.111
<i>I really don't care.</i>

03:15.111 --> 03:17.530
<i>You're way too hot to be hung up
on some Hemingway wannabe.</i>

03:17.530 --> 03:21.534
<i>I hope to one day share
that perspective.</i>

03:23.036 --> 03:24.454
<i>I got to run to rehearsal</i>

03:24.454 --> 03:25.455
<i>but when I get back,
you better be gone.</i>

03:25.455 --> 03:27.207
<i>I will definitely be here.</i>

03:27.207 --> 03:29.042
<i>Angie...</i>

03:29.042 --> 03:31.544
<i>I'm serious. I can't see him.</i>

03:31.544 --> 03:33.379
<i>There's nothing in
this whole world that's</i>

03:33.379 --> 03:35.381
<i>gonna make me want to go.
-</i>

03:35.381 --> 03:37.967
<i>Who's that?
Did you invite someone over?</i>

03:37.967 --> 03:39.385
No.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.389
<i>Surprise!
- Surprise!</i>

03:43.389 --> 03:44.891
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Hey.</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:46.434
<i>Wait, what are
you guys doing here?</i>

03:46.434 --> 03:48.895
<i>Well, we weren't
gonna miss your reading.</i>

03:48.895 --> 03:50.939
<i>We're gonna film it,
is that okay?</i>

03:50.939 --> 03:52.398
<i>No, no, the reading...</i>

03:52.398 --> 03:55.443
<i>It's not a thing.
It's a non-thing.</i>

03:55.443 --> 03:57.028
<i>Right?
- Yep, a total non-thing.</i>

03:57.028 --> 03:58.196
Well, not according to

03:58.196 --> 04:00.573
<i>the department website.</i>

04:00.573 --> 04:01.574
<i>Are you coming?</i>

04:01.574 --> 04:03.326
<i>Me? No.
- Yes.</i>

04:03.326 --> 04:04.953
Yes.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.663
<i>Is something wrong?
- Nope.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:07.664
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

04:07.664 --> 04:09.290
<i>She's nervous.</i>

04:09.290 --> 04:10.667
<i>I'm nervous.
- Oh...</i>

04:10.667 --> 04:11.834
<i>About the reading.</i>

04:11.834 --> 04:12.961
<i>Big nerves about it, so...</i>

04:12.961 --> 04:14.921
<i>Oh, honey, look, come here.</i>

04:14.921 --> 04:16.422
<i>Sit down.
- Don't... Okay.</i>

04:16.422 --> 04:19.092
<i>You have nothing
to be nervous about, at all.</i>

04:19.092 --> 04:21.511
<i>That's what I told her.
- It's gonna be great, okay?</i>

04:21.511 --> 04:24.055
<i>Just breathe, like in
your stomach sort of.</i>

04:24.055 --> 04:26.766
<i>Okay. Just... You don't
have to be nervous, honey.</i>

04:26.766 --> 04:28.601
<i>Because you are
an amazing writer.</i>

04:28.601 --> 04:30.770
<i>Yes. And you have
such command of the stage.</i>

04:30.770 --> 04:32.772
<i>You were so terrific
in your high school productions.</i>

04:32.772 --> 04:34.691
<i>I was a stage hand.</i>

04:34.691 --> 04:35.942
<i>And it was memorable.</i>

04:35.942 --> 04:37.402
<i>Okay.
- Well, that's good.</i>

04:37.402 --> 04:38.528
Thanks. I hope that experience

04:38.528 --> 04:39.570
<i>can get me through today.</i>

04:39.570 --> 04:41.948
It will.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.451
<i>And then afterwards we can all
go out to dinner and celebrate.</i>

04:45.451 --> 04:47.412
<i>I made a reservation
at Providence.</i>

04:47.412 --> 04:49.789
<i>So bougie.
- Okay, okay.</i>

04:49.789 --> 04:51.499
<i>I guess, um,</i>

04:51.499 --> 04:53.293
<i>we're all going to this thing.
- Yep.</i>

04:53.293 --> 04:54.627
<i>Yay.
- Great.</i>

04:54.627 --> 04:58.298
Um, maybe you should, um...

04:58.298 --> 05:00.425
<i>Are you gonna...
Yeah, maybe change?</i>

05:00.425 --> 05:02.510
<i>Uh, maybe just a quick shower.</i>

05:02.510 --> 05:04.304
<i>Mom, stop.
- Maybe just pits and bits.</i>

05:04.304 --> 05:05.805
<i>Or you could wipe just...</i>

05:05.805 --> 05:07.307
<i>very fast with water.
- Guys.</i>

05:07.307 --> 05:09.434
<i>Or-or whatever you think
is best.</i>

05:09.434 --> 05:11.060
<i>Totally fine. Okay.
- That's-that's good.</i>

05:11.060 --> 05:12.353
Now go, so I can get ready.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.813
<i>Okay.
- You can get ready.</i>

05:13.813 --> 05:14.981
<i>Um, I love you.
- We're going.</i>

05:14.981 --> 05:16.190
Break a leg.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.608
Bye. Nice meeting you.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.527
You look great.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.654
They're low-key iconic.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.657
<i>upbeat music</i>

05:24.657 --> 05:27.827
<i>Uh-huh, oh, yeah</i>

05:27.827 --> 05:29.495
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

05:29.495 --> 05:30.788
<i>Uh, where she get it?</i>

05:30.788 --> 05:32.498
<i>Uh-huh, uh-uh</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:41.090
<i>Are you sneaking out?</i>

05:44.677 --> 05:47.305
<i>Do you want some coffee?</i>

05:47.305 --> 05:49.515
<i>No, um, I'm good, thanks.</i>

05:49.515 --> 05:53.770
<i>It was really nice
to have you here last night.</i>

05:53.770 --> 05:55.355
<i>I think Mack missed you.</i>

05:55.355 --> 05:59.025
<i>He's a good boy.</i>

05:59.025 --> 06:04.697
<i>Um, I was thinking maybe
we could go talk to someone.</i>

06:07.283 --> 06:09.160
<i>If-if you're ready to.</i>

06:11.120 --> 06:13.414
<i>I'm not... yet.</i>

06:15.917 --> 06:18.044
<i>Thought it might be a good idea.</i>

06:18.044 --> 06:20.129
<i>Well, you also thought
it would be a good idea</i>

06:20.129 --> 06:22.340
<i>to fuck another woman, um...</i>

06:22.340 --> 06:24.592
<i>I'm gonna go to the,
um, expansion</i>

06:24.592 --> 06:26.052
<i>and-and meet the tile guy.</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:28.388
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

06:28.388 --> 06:30.223
<i>You can try to fight it</i>

06:30.223 --> 06:32.308
<i>Go ahead, if you dare</i>

06:32.308 --> 06:34.060
<i>No one's gonna help you</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:36.396
<i>This is life, it ain't fair</i>

06:36.396 --> 06:38.022
<i>Do you got it?</i>

06:39.440 --> 06:41.234
<i>Do you got it?</i>

06:41.234 --> 06:43.820
<i>Look at these little
jelly bean toes.</i>

06:43.820 --> 06:45.321
<i>They're so squishy.
Are you looking?</i>

06:45.321 --> 06:46.697
<i>Yes.
- Like-- Look.</i>

06:46.697 --> 06:49.742
<i>Ooh! Oh, he's perfect.
-</i>

06:49.742 --> 06:53.913
<i>I mean, his cat box is not
perfect. It's like-- whew.</i>

06:53.913 --> 06:55.873
<i>But I cracked a window.</i>

06:55.873 --> 06:57.417
<i>Oh, look at this one.
Look at this one.</i>

06:57.417 --> 06:59.043
<i>Come on. Have you ever seen
anything cuter?</i>

06:59.043 --> 07:00.253
Aww.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.921
<i>Yeah, just the other
200 pictures</i>

07:01.921 --> 07:03.673
<i>you showed me of
your kitten yesterday.</i>

07:03.673 --> 07:07.552
<i>Anyway, um, how are those
Rachel questions coming along?</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:09.387
<i>Oh, so good.
- Okay.</i>

07:09.387 --> 07:10.680
<i>Yeah, I can't believe we're
wrapping this season</i>

07:10.680 --> 07:12.348
<i>with the Rachel Maddow.</i>

07:12.348 --> 07:14.183
<i>I mean, we are living
the queer dream here, so...</i>

07:15.351 --> 07:19.939
<i>Ooh, do you have the green? Ah.</i>

07:19.939 --> 07:21.899
<i>There's only two.</i>

07:21.899 --> 07:25.653
<i>Um, Alice.
- Yeah?</i>

07:25.653 --> 07:29.699
<i>Did you interrupt a movie
at a theater recently?</i>

07:29.699 --> 07:31.617
<i>Who's asking?</i>

07:31.617 --> 07:33.744
<i>Uh, everyone in my DMs.</i>

07:33.744 --> 07:36.289
<i>Apparently James Corden
retweeted the video</i>

07:36.289 --> 07:38.249
<i>and now the hashtag...</i>

07:38.249 --> 07:41.752
<i>Oh, my God, that guy.
-"AliceSoEntitled" is...</i>

07:41.752 --> 07:44.255
<i>is trending.
-"Entitled"?</i>

07:44.255 --> 07:45.798
<i>How is that even...</i>

07:46.382 --> 07:49.552
<i>All right. Yeah, I see it.
- Wait a minute.</i>

07:49.552 --> 07:51.095
<i>Did you yell
at an elderly woman, too?</i>

07:51.095 --> 07:52.638
<i>Oh, my God.
- What? What...?</i>

07:52.638 --> 07:55.475
<i>Okay, we had a rapport
until she turned on me.</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:57.143
<i>Okay, and-and...</i>

07:57.143 --> 07:59.979
<i>Oh, and then you told everyone
how the movie ended.</i>

07:59.979 --> 08:01.731
<i>Oh, my God, it was an old movie.</i>

08:01.731 --> 08:03.733
<i>Everybody knows
how the movie ends.</i>

08:03.733 --> 08:05.276
<i>Now everyone's talking about...
-</i>

08:05.276 --> 08:07.653
<i>...all this other bullshit
you've done.</i>

08:07.653 --> 08:09.238


08:10.239 --> 08:12.783
<i>Alice, do you know
a guy named Daryl Brewer?</i>

08:12.783 --> 08:14.202
<i>exciting music</i>

08:16.579 --> 08:18.122
<i>Oh, God.</i>

08:18.122 --> 08:19.499
<i>All eyes on me</i>

08:21.792 --> 08:23.377
Okay...

08:23.377 --> 08:25.379
<i>All right, here we are.</i>

08:25.379 --> 08:27.256
<i>A quarter-mile incline
with a view, baby.</i>

08:27.256 --> 08:28.716
<i>I'm gonna run up ahead,</i>

08:28.716 --> 08:30.760
<i>find the quarter-mile mark
for us.</i>

08:30.760 --> 08:32.261
<i>You got this.
- Okay. All right.</i>

08:32.261 --> 08:33.429
<i>Just follow when you're ready.
Stretch out.</i>

08:33.429 --> 08:34.972
<i>Don't get hurt.
- All right.</i>

08:34.972 --> 08:36.474
Are you sure?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.184
<i>That looks like longer
than a quarter mile.</i>

08:38.184 --> 08:40.603
<i>Well, it's gonna get
a lot closer once we get going.</i>

08:40.603 --> 08:42.688
<i>Yeah.
- And then, uh...</i>

08:42.688 --> 08:44.607
<i>we can get going.</i>

08:46.108 --> 08:48.152
<i>Well, you know, I would,
uh, like that,</i>

08:48.152 --> 08:50.029
<i>I just don't want to
die during it.</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:52.031
<i>You know?</i>

08:52.031 --> 08:53.658
<i>Okay.
- Yeah.</i>

08:53.658 --> 08:56.202
<i>You know, um...</i>

08:57.370 --> 09:00.289
<i>I wasn't expecting
to feel all these...</i>

09:00.289 --> 09:01.999
<i>feelings with you, you know?</i>

09:01.999 --> 09:04.752
<i>Yeah, me neither.</i>

09:04.752 --> 09:06.462
<i>gentle music</i>

09:06.462 --> 09:08.005
<i>I mean...</i>

09:08.005 --> 09:10.299
<i>I'm not somebody who just,</i>

09:10.299 --> 09:12.468
<i>you know, jumps right into
sex stuff or whatever.</i>

09:12.468 --> 09:13.719
<i>Okay.</i>

09:13.719 --> 09:15.638
<i>I totally understand that.</i>

09:15.638 --> 09:17.390
<i>Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

09:17.390 --> 09:19.392
<i>I can't take another heartbreak.</i>

09:21.018 --> 09:23.020
<i>We don't have to do anything
that you're not ready for, okay?</i>

09:24.188 --> 09:25.690
<i>Obviously.</i>

09:26.649 --> 09:28.025
<i>Thank you.
- Okay.</i>

09:28.025 --> 09:30.319
<i>But also I'm very good at it.</i>

09:30.319 --> 09:32.029
<i>You're what?
-</i>

09:32.029 --> 09:34.031
<i>I just-- I want you to have
all of the information.</i>

09:34.031 --> 09:36.367
<i>I am excellent at it,
I've had a lot of practice,</i>

09:36.367 --> 09:38.494
<i>it would be a, you know,
shame to miss out, really.</i>

09:38.494 --> 09:41.706
<i>I don't plan on missing out,
Misty. At all. Oh, look,</i>

09:41.706 --> 09:43.708
<i>a family is here.
Hello. This is a family hike.</i>

09:43.708 --> 09:46.168
<i>No sex talk.
- All right, all right.</i>

09:46.168 --> 09:47.336
It's a family hike, Misty.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.922
Come on.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.340
<i>Oh, that's a...
that's an incline.</i>

09:51.340 --> 09:52.592
We got this.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.677
<i>energetic, upbeat music</i>

09:54.677 --> 09:57.763
<i>Up the tempo</i>

09:57.763 --> 09:59.056
<i>Alice,
I've got the board up my ass</i>

09:59.056 --> 10:00.766
<i>and sponsors ready to pull.</i>

10:00.766 --> 10:02.393
<i>What happened between
you and Daryl Brewer?</i>

10:02.393 --> 10:05.438
<i>I met him at a party.
He was with his boyfriend.</i>

10:05.438 --> 10:07.940
<i>Then his teammate came out
of the closet, which...</i>

10:07.940 --> 10:11.360
<i>was and is a very brave thing
to do, Barry.</i>

10:11.360 --> 10:13.029
<i>Okay.
- Then Daryl Brewer</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:16.282
<i>goes on national TV,
he gay-bashes him,</i>

10:16.282 --> 10:19.285
<i>so I responded by calling him
a fucking hypocrite</i>

10:19.285 --> 10:21.621
<i>and by doing so, yes,
I guess I outed him.</i>

10:21.621 --> 10:23.289
<i>Oh, Alice.</i>

10:23.289 --> 10:25.583
<i>But she feels
very differently now, Barry.</i>

10:25.583 --> 10:27.126
<i>No, I don't-- No, I don't.</i>

10:27.126 --> 10:29.253
<i>I feel exactly the same way.</i>

10:29.253 --> 10:30.796
People are angry.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.840
<i>They need to see
genuine remorse.</i>

10:32.840 --> 10:34.675
<i>If you can't give them that,</i>

10:34.675 --> 10:36.844
<i>we think it's best if
you cancel the show tonight.</i>

10:36.844 --> 10:40.473
<i>Go home, lay low.
Let this blow over.</i>

10:40.473 --> 10:41.974
<i>Barry? [laughs]</i>

10:41.974 --> 10:45.311
<i>I am not canceling
on Rachel Maddow, okay?</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:46.812
<i>Not my Maddow. Not my Maddow.</i>

10:46.812 --> 10:48.981
<i>We're gonna figure
this thing out, Barry.</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:51.859
<i>We really want to deliver
a great finale for our fans.</i>

10:51.859 --> 10:53.486
That would be ideal, but...

10:53.486 --> 10:55.321
<i>Thank you so much for your
leadership on this.</i>

10:55.321 --> 10:57.323
<i>We'll get back to you.
- All right,</i>

10:57.323 --> 10:58.491
<i>I'm giving you one shot.
Just don't make me</i>

10:58.491 --> 10:59.825
<i>look like an asshole, Alice.</i>

10:59.825 --> 11:01.160
All right. Thank you, Barry.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.873
<i>All right.</i>

11:07.124 --> 11:08.668
<i>What is the way out of this?</i>

11:10.211 --> 11:11.754
<i>I have no fucking clue.</i>

11:12.797 --> 11:14.173
<i>But we'll find it.</i>

11:14.173 --> 11:16.425
<i>Well, at least you
sounded like you knew.</i>

11:16.425 --> 11:17.677
<i>So, that's a good thing.</i>

11:17.677 --> 11:19.178
<i>What you want, what you need</i>

11:19.178 --> 11:20.930
<i>Got the smoke,
bring the weed</i>

11:20.930 --> 11:23.182
<i>Gassed enough, tryna see</i>

11:23.182 --> 11:25.142
<i>If you got that '93</i>

11:25.142 --> 11:26.811
<i>Right now</i>

11:26.811 --> 11:28.145
<i>Like it, like it, like it</i>

11:28.145 --> 11:30.356
<i>Give me that good loud</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:31.565
<i>Bring it now...</i>

11:33.192 --> 11:35.194
<i>I think I figured it out.</i>

11:35.194 --> 11:37.530
<i>Oh, yeah? The song's working?</i>

11:37.530 --> 11:39.365
<i>I think so.</i>

11:39.365 --> 11:40.366
<i>What's it about?</i>

11:40.366 --> 11:42.702
<i>I'm not telling you that.</i>

11:42.702 --> 11:44.745
<i>Oh, so it's a secret?</i>

11:44.745 --> 11:46.163
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:46.163 --> 11:48.165
<i>Oh.
-</i>

11:48.165 --> 11:49.375
<i>Well, I like secrets.</i>

11:49.375 --> 11:50.710
<i>Let me see.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.</i>

11:50.710 --> 11:51.711
<i>Gimme, gimme.
- No, no, no, no, no.</i>

11:51.711 --> 11:53.379
<i>Give me a peek.
- No.</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:55.715
<i>I swear I can feel us getting
close now...</i>

11:55.715 --> 11:59.009
<i>Come on. Tell me.
- Mm-mm.</i>

11:59.009 --> 12:01.345
<i>So discreetly when
you see me in my Fenty</i>

12:01.345 --> 12:04.181
<i>They on the floor,
floor, floor</i>

12:04.181 --> 12:07.309
<i>Let them inhibitions go,
go, go...</i>

12:07.309 --> 12:09.520
<i>God, I love you.</i>

12:09.520 --> 12:12.857
<i>I mean, I love what
you're doing.</i>

12:12.857 --> 12:14.942
<i>Is what I meant.</i>

12:18.028 --> 12:19.572
<i>Not, like, you.</i>

12:24.702 --> 12:26.078
<i>Um, it's... It's Sophie.</i>

12:26.078 --> 12:27.246
<i>I'm-a just...
- Yeah.</i>

12:27.246 --> 12:29.582
<i>Um, please.
- Yeah, okay.</i>

12:29.582 --> 12:31.834
<i>Hey, Soph.</i>

12:33.043 --> 12:34.628
<i>Perfect timing.</i>

12:39.925 --> 12:41.427
They probably can already tell.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.887
<i>They can, like, sniff
this shit out.</i>

12:42.887 --> 12:44.221
I'm the only person who knows

12:44.221 --> 12:46.056
<i>you're banging
the professor, okay?</i>

12:46.056 --> 12:47.308
<i>Was banging him.</i>

12:47.308 --> 12:48.559
<i>Was.</i>

12:48.559 --> 12:50.269
Hey, uh, good afternoon.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.645
<i>We're about to get started,</i>

12:51.645 --> 12:52.438
<i>so if you could all please
take your seats.</i>

12:52.438 --> 12:53.481
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:53.481 --> 12:54.774
<i>Bella.</i>

12:54.774 --> 12:56.150
<i>Here, come join us.</i>

12:56.150 --> 12:58.235
<i>Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

12:59.153 --> 13:00.654
Okay.

13:00.654 --> 13:03.073
<i>You got this. Good luck.</i>

13:03.073 --> 13:04.658
<i>Do I?</i>

13:07.912 --> 13:09.455
<i>You're the best person I know.</i>

13:09.455 --> 13:11.081
<i>I don't know about that.
That's...</i>

13:11.081 --> 13:15.294
<i>Oh, you're smart and kind</i>

13:15.294 --> 13:18.130
<i>and full of life and wisdom.</i>

13:18.130 --> 13:20.716
<i>He's an idiot
and you're a catch.</i>

13:21.842 --> 13:23.552
<i>It's so obvious.</i>

13:23.552 --> 13:24.970
<i>Says who?</i>

13:24.970 --> 13:26.597
<i>gentle music</i>

13:29.016 --> 13:30.226
<i>You got this.</i>

13:30.226 --> 13:31.977
Thank you all for coming.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.479
<i>My name is Samuel Hendrix,</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:35.898
<i>I'm the Intro to Creative
Writing instructor.</i>

13:35.898 --> 13:38.651
<i>And, yeah, okay.
Here we are. Um...</i>

13:38.651 --> 13:41.529
<i>I've been excited about this day
the whole semester.</i>

13:41.529 --> 13:43.197
<i>I've gotten to watch
these young writers</i>

13:43.197 --> 13:45.115
<i>really come in to their own.</i>

13:45.115 --> 13:48.118
<i>And now, today,
you all get a front-row seat</i>

13:48.118 --> 13:50.955
<i>at the next generation
of young poets</i>

13:50.955 --> 13:53.874
<i>and writers of all kinds.</i>

13:53.874 --> 13:57.211
<i>So, sit back, relax,</i>

13:57.211 --> 14:00.506
<i>and let's have a good time.</i>

14:00.506 --> 14:04.134
<i>Dani has written hundreds
of these public apologies.</i>

14:04.134 --> 14:05.636
I'm happy to give you a template

14:05.636 --> 14:07.012
<i>and then we can tailor it together.</i>

14:07.012 --> 14:10.057
<i>Or a better idea,
I could just lean in.</i>

14:10.057 --> 14:12.601
<i>Uh, I don't know, Alice.</i>

14:12.601 --> 14:15.938
<i>"Lean in" sounds like
the opposite of "lay low."</i>

14:15.938 --> 14:17.314
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:17.314 --> 14:18.607
Okay, look, if people really

14:18.607 --> 14:21.193
<i>think that I'm
an out-of-touch...</i>

14:21.193 --> 14:24.864
<i>entitled asshole, then I say
we make a bit out of it.</i>

14:24.864 --> 14:27.199
<i>Uh, I fear that would
make things worse. [chuckles]</i>

14:28.242 --> 14:29.368
<i>Kimmel would do it.</i>

14:29.368 --> 14:30.995
<i>Um...
- Sophie.</i>

14:30.995 --> 14:32.204
<i>You know he would.</i>

14:32.204 --> 14:33.998
<i>Yes, but...</i>

14:33.998 --> 14:36.375
<i>Kimmel isn't a queer woman.</i>

14:36.375 --> 14:39.461
<i>Which is exactly
why I should do it.</i>

14:39.461 --> 14:41.005
<i>I know, Alice, I know.</i>

14:41.005 --> 14:42.840
<i>I hear you, but...
- Listen.</i>

14:42.840 --> 14:46.385
<i>I don't mean any disrespect
by saying this.</i>

14:46.385 --> 14:50.055
<i>But you two do not know what
it was like to be gay back then.</i>

14:50.055 --> 14:51.724
<i>You just don't.</i>

14:51.724 --> 14:54.351
<i>You weren't there.</i>

14:54.351 --> 14:58.272
<i>Somebody with his power
and his status</i>

14:58.272 --> 15:01.942
<i>saying "down with the fags"
was like a normal thing.</i>

15:01.942 --> 15:04.778
<i>We don't use that word anymore.
- It's the anti-gay F-word.</i>

15:04.778 --> 15:09.199
<i>Well, that's really long
to say, but... Okay.</i>

15:09.199 --> 15:12.453
<i>I just...
I don't regret what I said.</i>

15:12.453 --> 15:14.705
<i>So, I don't think
I should apologize.</i>

15:15.789 --> 15:17.583
<i>Okay.</i>

15:19.209 --> 15:20.878
<i>Alice...</i>

15:23.589 --> 15:26.091
<i>I see you, I really do.</i>

15:26.091 --> 15:28.969
<i>And I get that this is what
you want to do.</i>

15:30.137 --> 15:33.599
<i>But I'm just trying
to look out for the show here.</i>

15:33.599 --> 15:36.602
<i>We're still the only ones
on television.</i>

15:36.602 --> 15:39.021
<i>gentle music</i>

15:41.482 --> 15:43.108
<i>Okay.</i>

15:44.151 --> 15:46.236
<i>I'll give you an apology.</i>

15:46.236 --> 15:47.446
<i>Make you happy?</i>

15:47.446 --> 15:49.406
<i>Yes.</i>

15:49.406 --> 15:50.950
<i>I'm gonna go prep for Maddow.</i>

15:50.950 --> 15:54.787
<i>If you guys come up with
something, come find me.</i>

15:56.538 --> 15:58.332
<i>Okay.</i>

16:01.293 --> 16:02.378
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:02.378 --> 16:04.046
<i>I'm just following your lead.</i>

16:04.046 --> 16:05.422
<i>Where should we work?</i>

16:05.422 --> 16:07.716
<i>Come on.</i>

16:07.716 --> 16:10.260
A slim opening in the trees

16:10.260 --> 16:12.596
<i>gives way to the dirt path,</i>

16:12.596 --> 16:14.765
<i>which weaves down
the hillside...</i>

16:14.765 --> 16:17.142
<i>My car got broken into
a couple days ago.</i>

16:17.142 --> 16:18.227
Young trees...

16:18.227 --> 16:20.604
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

16:20.604 --> 16:24.066
<i>Yeah, somebody shattered
the window.</i>

16:24.066 --> 16:27.486
<i>It cost me like 250 bucks
to replace it.</i>

16:27.486 --> 16:29.238
<i>What a terrible inconvenience.</i>

16:29.238 --> 16:31.323
<i>I almost reported a theft.</i>

16:32.700 --> 16:35.327
<i>Until I realized
only one thing was missing.</i>

16:36.453 --> 16:37.663
<i>What was that?</i>

16:40.040 --> 16:42.710
<i>It was that chapbook
you made me.</i>

16:43.711 --> 16:45.754
<i>A criminal with good taste.</i>

16:46.964 --> 16:48.590
<i>Maybe.</i>

16:49.800 --> 16:51.677
<i>Or...</i>

16:51.677 --> 16:55.347
<i>maybe an immature person
whose feelings were hurt,</i>

16:55.347 --> 16:56.765
<i>so they decided to vandalize</i>

16:56.765 --> 16:58.350
<i>somebody's property
for no reason.</i>

16:59.643 --> 17:02.813
<i>I had a very valid reason,
Professor Hendrix.</i>

<i>"Sometimes I lose sight of
my own power and responsibility</i>

Yeah, okay, wait.

I'm wondering though.</i>

And landing the jump.</i>
