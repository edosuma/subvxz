WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.033
Previously
on Witches of East End...
I was here first.

00:03.066 --> 00:05.033
Actually, I
was here first.

00:05.066 --> 00:06.833
The whole "look at me,
I'm so cute" thing

00:06.866 --> 00:08.400
doesn't work with me.

00:08.433 --> 00:11.300
You murdered
your own brother.

00:11.333 --> 00:12.866
I didn't murder you!

00:12.900 --> 00:14.666
WENDY:
Killian is dead.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.733
Sounds like you had a vision.
You have a gift for premonition.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.000
So he might still be alive.

00:18.033 --> 00:20.400
(flatline)

00:20.433 --> 00:22.633
KILLIAN:
What's happening to you
is not scientific.

00:22.666 --> 00:24.733
You're not gonna find the reason
in an MRI.

00:24.766 --> 00:26.700
DR. CARLYLE:
I got the MRI scan.

00:26.733 --> 00:27.833
I found a match.

00:27.866 --> 00:28.666
Ingrid Beauchamp.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.833
Nice to see you again.

00:30.866 --> 00:32.666
WENDY:
I knew something came through
the portal. I tracked him

00:32.700 --> 00:34.666
to the woods tonight.
We need to know

00:34.700 --> 00:36.200
who we're dealing with.
There's a reason he doesn't

00:36.233 --> 00:37.400
want us to know who he is.

00:37.433 --> 00:39.466
Stay the hell

00:39.500 --> 00:41.833
away from me.

00:41.866 --> 00:43.866
What do you think the girls
are gonna say when I tell them

00:43.900 --> 00:45.800
that you left
their brother behind?

00:45.833 --> 00:48.166
JOANNA:
Frederick?

00:48.200 --> 00:49.166
I don't trust him.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.833
The owl?
It's a spirit animal.

00:50.866 --> 00:52.533
In Killian's darkest moment,

00:52.566 --> 00:54.066
he was visited by the owl.

00:54.100 --> 00:54.966
Where have you been?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.300
I c... I can't remember.

00:56.333 --> 00:58.166
Did anyone
or anything

00:58.200 --> 01:00.866
come through the portal
with you?

01:00.900 --> 01:03.233
(birds chirping)

01:09.666 --> 01:10.966
Hey. What's going on?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.533
I'm worried
about Ingrid.

01:12.566 --> 01:15.333
What time did she come home
from the bar last night?

01:15.366 --> 01:18.033
Uh, midnight? I don't know.
She said she wanted

01:18.066 --> 01:20.133
to walk home.
Uh, Ingrid? Call me back.

01:20.166 --> 01:22.333
Immediately.
(sighs)

01:22.366 --> 01:24.433
I think something's
happened to her.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.400
Mom.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.533
Oh, my God!
JOANNA: Ingrid!

01:34.566 --> 01:36.433
Oh, Ingrid.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.666
(sniffs)

01:56.766 --> 01:58.233
Still shooting blanks?

01:58.266 --> 02:01.000
(cell phone ringing)

02:02.666 --> 02:03.833
(mutters quietly)

02:03.866 --> 02:05.833
Um...

02:05.866 --> 02:08.300
Yeah, uh, this is Dr. Gardiner.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.800
(digitally altered male voice):
Did you receive the e‐mail

02:09.833 --> 02:11.233
I sent you?

02:11.266 --> 02:13.866
Y‐Yeah. Yeah.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.866
I saw you kill your brother.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.466
I have the evidence.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.566
Would you like me to send it
to the police?

02:20.600 --> 02:22.633
No.

02:22.666 --> 02:25.300
Then I'm gonna need
$50,000 in cash today.

02:25.333 --> 02:26.733
Today? That‐that's impossible.

02:26.766 --> 02:28.566
Not for you it isn't.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.166
It's a federal holiday.
The banks are closed.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.833
There‐there's no way.

02:31.866 --> 02:34.366
We both know you're loaded,
Dr. Gardiner.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.066
Figure it out.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.500
I'll be in touch.

02:42.666 --> 02:45.033
You're screwed, bro.

02:45.066 --> 02:47.333
Back off!

02:47.366 --> 02:49.966
You better get a hold of this
before you kill someone.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.766
I mean someone else.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.200
FREYA:
She's so cold.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.866
Well, she's alive‐‐
that's what counts.

03:05.900 --> 03:07.033
Ingrid?

03:07.066 --> 03:09.366
Ingrid.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.400
(sighs)

03:10.433 --> 03:12.900
What happened?

03:12.933 --> 03:14.466
You must have been
sleepwalking again.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.566
Either that or she passed out

03:16.600 --> 03:18.233
cold in the yard.
What?

03:18.266 --> 03:20.300
I'm just saying she was
pretty drunk last night.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.633
Oh, my God.

03:21.666 --> 03:23.333
That's all right, sweetie.

03:23.366 --> 03:25.133
We'll heal those.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.566
What about the sleepwalking?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.200
We'll have to find a spell.
This isn't safe.

03:29.233 --> 03:30.966
You know what's crazy
is that I think

03:31.000 --> 03:33.300
that was the best night's sleep
I've had in years.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.700
(both laughing)

03:34.733 --> 03:36.566
And I'm starving.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.133
I want pancakes...

03:38.166 --> 03:39.866
Yeah?
and eggs and bacon

03:39.900 --> 03:42.333
and tacos!
I would kill for a taco!

03:42.366 --> 03:43.966
All right.
Let's get you inside.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.366
Okay.
I'll make some eggs.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.366
Besides, uh,
we need to talk.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.133
Okay.

03:50.166 --> 03:53.300
First I want to say I am sorry

03:53.333 --> 03:56.300
that I didn't tell you
girls the truth sooner.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.566
I really, I really

03:58.600 --> 04:00.633
did have my reas... reason...

04:00.666 --> 04:02.800
Well, we can talk
about that later.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.033
So... okay.

04:04.066 --> 04:05.966
(laughs)
Here goes. All right.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
400 years ago,

04:08.033 --> 04:11.200
in Asgard, there was a war.

04:11.233 --> 04:12.333
And...
You have a brother.

04:12.366 --> 04:13.366
And he's upstairs asleep.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.800
What?!
Thank you, Wendy.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.633
It's like a Band‐Aid.
You just got to yank it off.

04:16.666 --> 04:17.666
A brother?
Are you kidding?

04:17.700 --> 04:19.133
Wh... how could you have

04:19.166 --> 04:20.300
never told us this?!

04:20.333 --> 04:21.233
I'm so sorry.

04:21.266 --> 04:22.800
Leaving Frederick behind

04:22.833 --> 04:24.333
was one of the most
painful decisions

04:24.366 --> 04:25.900
I've ever had to make.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.466
Actually, he chose to
stay behind in Asgard

04:29.500 --> 04:31.300
all of these years
with your grandfather.

04:31.333 --> 04:34.200
Otherwise known as the guy
who cursed all of us.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.466
But he's been
through a lot since then.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.300
And he barely escaped
with his life.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.966
And we're very
lucky that he did

04:40.000 --> 04:41.800
because it was Frederick

04:41.833 --> 04:43.966
who cured me last night.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.500
The argenteum is
completely out of my system.

04:47.533 --> 04:49.366
Wait, what?
How does that happen?
How can he do that?

04:49.400 --> 04:51.166
I‐It's a miracle!

04:51.200 --> 04:55.000
So, our brother is the one
who came through the portal.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.700
But Wendy saw
a shadow in the woods

04:56.733 --> 04:58.233
and she said
his aura was vicious

04:58.266 --> 05:00.200
and predatory.
Exactly.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.700
Well‐well, we think
that someone else

05:02.733 --> 05:04.366
came through the portal
at the same time

05:04.400 --> 05:06.633
and that's the dark aura that

05:06.666 --> 05:07.966
Wendy saw in the woods.
It might...

05:08.000 --> 05:09.666
It was. It was.
...have been.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.566
Freya, Ingrid.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.066
(quiet laugh)

05:13.100 --> 05:14.866
I can't believe
it's really you.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.933
(quiet laugh)

05:18.933 --> 05:20.733
Now, you used to wake me up

05:20.766 --> 05:23.700
in the middle of the night,
Freya, in the dead of winter.

05:23.733 --> 05:25.300
"I want to watch the sun rise
on Ayre Beach."

05:25.333 --> 05:26.733
(laughs)

05:26.766 --> 05:28.833
Which, mind you, was
a thousand miles away.

05:28.866 --> 05:30.833
And I was so mad at you,
I just wanted to sleep.

05:30.866 --> 05:32.666
But I could never
refuse you, either.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.500
So, we‐we'd do the spell.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.300
We'd join hands and then...

05:36.333 --> 05:38.133
there we were.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.733
Standing in the warm sand,

05:39.766 --> 05:41.533
watching the sun come up.

05:41.566 --> 05:43.733
We had some of our best
talks on that beach.

05:43.766 --> 05:44.800
I still think about them.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.166
Uh, I don't understand.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.466
How would we get there?

05:47.500 --> 05:48.466
Well, we weren't
actually there.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.166
We'd simply project

05:50.200 --> 05:52.166
our, uh, thought bodies.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.066
It's a spell we used
to do together.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.233
That's astral projection.
That's incredible.

05:56.266 --> 05:58.200
Did you ever do that with me?

05:58.233 --> 06:01.566
No. No, it only works with Freya
because we're twins.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.233
Oh, my God!

06:03.266 --> 06:04.366
That is crazy!

06:04.400 --> 06:05.900
I always wanted a twin.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.400
I used to talk
about this all the time

06:07.433 --> 06:08.833
when we were kids.
Do you remember?
I know.

06:08.866 --> 06:10.500
I always thought
she was just being

06:10.533 --> 06:12.333
narcissistic,
like you wanted

06:12.366 --> 06:13.733
another version of you around.

06:13.766 --> 06:15.733
But I think somehow you knew.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.366
You're both
exactly the same.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.166
I missed you so much.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.300
(laughs)

06:20.333 --> 06:21.933
(little gasp)

06:27.766 --> 06:30.833
You know that Frederick is
alone in the kitchen right now

06:30.866 --> 06:34.066
with your daughters while you're
out here‐‐ what? Pulling weeds?

06:34.100 --> 06:35.733
(laughs)
I'm not pulling weeds.

06:35.766 --> 06:38.466
I'm picking radix sinceritate.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.133
Ah, truth root!

06:40.166 --> 06:42.800
If Freya's right
and Dash does have powers,

06:42.833 --> 06:44.800
I want to confirm.
She could be in real danger.

06:44.833 --> 06:47.533
So, I'm gonna put it in a pie
I'm making and take it up

06:47.566 --> 06:48.833
to Fair Haven later.
You want to come?

06:48.866 --> 06:50.066
That's your plan?

06:50.100 --> 06:51.666
Magic pie?

06:51.700 --> 06:53.566
He doesn't have
to eat it all.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.066
He just has to get
a whiff of it.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.633
It's pretty strong stuff.

06:57.666 --> 06:58.733
I saw Dash last night.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.666
He is angry, volatile.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.000
We have to approach
this carefully.

07:02.033 --> 07:04.800
That was the idea.
Are you in or out?

07:04.833 --> 07:06.066
Oh, I'm in.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.066
Um, while we're at it,

07:08.100 --> 07:09.833
uh, I think m‐maybe
we should just give

07:09.866 --> 07:11.333
Frederick a little
bit of the pie.

07:11.366 --> 07:12.700
Wendy, get off of it!

07:12.733 --> 07:14.366
I don't need a truth root.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.166
When Frederick
healed me last night,

07:16.200 --> 07:17.466
I saw the truth.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.466
I could feel his love for me.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.966
And all he wanted
to do was heal me.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.833
And I know how ridiculous

07:24.866 --> 07:26.300
and naiïve it sounds.

07:26.333 --> 07:29.066
I haven't forgotten
what he did to us.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.300
But I could feel

07:30.333 --> 07:32.633
his pain and his regret.

07:32.666 --> 07:35.500
He knows that he betrayed us.

07:35.533 --> 07:36.866
And he was brainwashed.

07:36.900 --> 07:40.300
Or he... might still be.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.166
Well, he had the presence
of mind to escape,

07:43.200 --> 07:44.733
and I think that should
tell you something.

07:44.766 --> 07:46.233
Or he pretended to escape

07:46.266 --> 07:48.000
so that he could play on
your guilt and sympathy.

07:48.033 --> 07:49.800
Yeah, well...
Mm.

07:49.833 --> 07:51.633
(gasps)
She was naked?

07:51.666 --> 07:54.566
Are you kidding me?
Ingrid? Naked in public?

07:54.600 --> 07:57.166
Naked and drunk as a skunk on
mead, shouting to the rooftops,

07:57.200 --> 07:58.633
"Ero regina!"

07:58.666 --> 08:00.900
Why was I shouting,
"I will be queen"?

08:00.933 --> 08:03.200
Well, you are a princess.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.466
I am?
What?

08:05.500 --> 08:07.733
Mom?

08:07.766 --> 08:09.200
I cannot tell you

08:09.233 --> 08:11.233
how happy this makes me.

08:11.266 --> 08:14.333
My whole family
together finally.

08:14.366 --> 08:16.300
Why would you not tell us
that we're royalty?

08:16.333 --> 08:18.533
(groans)
Because

08:18.566 --> 08:22.033
being royalty in Asgard is kind
of irrelevant in this world.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.533
Oh.
And on that note,

08:23.566 --> 08:25.700
as I am no longer a princess,
I'm going to work.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.066
And I will meet you all
at the park later

08:27.100 --> 08:28.900
for Fourth of July.
Bye.
Ciao.

08:28.933 --> 08:30.133
Where's Father?
Is he coming with us?

08:30.166 --> 08:31.300
JOANNA:
Uh, I left him a message.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.666
He's out of cell phone range.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.000
He's actually in South America.

08:34.033 --> 08:35.133
He went to look for a cure

FREDERICK: Not long after
you all came here,

08:55.400 --> 08:57.700
I realized the mistake I made.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.466
I tried to save him.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.033
To convince him to give
in to his better nature.

09:02.066 --> 09:04.400
But he grew more and more
paranoid and corrupt.

09:04.433 --> 09:06.700
And I became the
receptacle of that rage.

09:06.733 --> 09:09.066
In the end, I almost
wished for death.

22:10.227 --> 22:12.227
megintíri;

22:12.260 --> 22:14.227
lia godra galdra

22:14.260 --> 22:16.560
gamanruna.

22:16.594 --> 22:18.494
Now speak the name
of the one you seek.

22:18.527 --> 22:21.194
(exhales)

22:21.227 --> 22:22.327
Killian Gardiner.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.760
Again.

22:23.794 --> 22:25.527
Killian Gardiner.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.260
Good.

22:27.294 --> 22:29.194
Get ready.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.460
(door slams)
(exclaims)

23:05.060 --> 23:06.527
Where are we?

23:06.560 --> 23:08.094
I have no idea.

23:08.127 --> 23:09.394
Look around. But
whatever you do,

23:09.427 --> 23:11.927
don't let go
of my hand.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.527
Look.

23:15.927 --> 23:18.094
"Hotel El Corazon."

23:24.360 --> 23:25.827
He's here.

23:25.860 --> 23:27.860
He's in that room.

23:35.227 --> 23:37.794
(screeching)

23:43.860 --> 23:45.360
(owl screeching)

23:47.694 --> 23:48.827
What the hell was that?

23:48.860 --> 23:50.194
I'm not sure.

23:50.227 --> 23:52.427
Owls can be omens
of fortune or doom.

23:52.460 --> 23:53.827
There was an owl
in his tarot cards.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.727
I think we just met it.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.094
Well, that one didn't
look very fortunate.

23:57.127 --> 23:58.360
It looked more like doom.

23:58.394 --> 24:00.660
But at least now
I know where he is.

24:00.694 --> 24:02.694
What are you gonna do?

24:04.427 --> 24:06.094
I'm gonna go find him.

24:06.127 --> 24:08.827
A little help
over here?

24:08.860 --> 24:10.427
No, Santo Domingo.
Hello. Miss?
Excuse me. Miss?

24:10.460 --> 24:12.060
A direct flight,
if you've got it.

24:12.094 --> 24:14.427
The sooner
the better.
WOMAN: I'm very sorry,

24:14.460 --> 24:16.327
but I don't see any flights
Can I get a strawberry
margarita?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.694
to Santo Domingo
today or tomorrow.

24:18.727 --> 24:20.394
Nothing today or tomorrow?
Well,

24:20.427 --> 24:22.727
what about
Tuesday?
Uh, can we get another round?

24:22.760 --> 24:26.660
(sighs)
I'm gonna have to call you back.

24:26.694 --> 24:28.727
WOMAN:
Is that a swan?

24:28.760 --> 24:31.027
FREDERICK:
No. No, it's a Pikachen.

24:31.060 --> 24:32.927
What's a Pikachen?
(soft laugh)

24:32.960 --> 24:34.927
Well, it's
like a swan.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.927
(short laugh)

24:36.960 --> 24:38.927
Wow. Thank you.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.560
It's really cool.

24:40.594 --> 24:43.594
FREYA:
Ah, you're making friends.

24:43.627 --> 24:46.094
It's a lot easier here
than it was in Asgard.

24:46.127 --> 24:48.527
Hey...

24:48.560 --> 24:51.060
That spell
we did was amazing.

24:51.094 --> 24:52.894
I've never felt
anything like that.

24:52.927 --> 24:54.894
Well, that's what it means
to have a twin.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.827
Well, I'm glad you're mine.

24:56.860 --> 25:00.427
(short laugh)
See you later for fireworks?
You bet.

25:03.627 --> 25:07.894
Hey. Be careful.

25:07.927 --> 25:09.227
Is there danger?

25:09.260 --> 25:11.527
No, but, just,
don't go around doing...

25:11.560 --> 25:13.994
you know...
What?

25:14.027 --> 25:15.360
Witchcraft.

25:17.260 --> 25:21.160
I'm saying, just‐‐ no spells.

25:21.194 --> 25:23.327
I'm just saying
no magic...
Yeah, I know.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.894
I'm messing with you,
Freya. I get it.

25:25.927 --> 25:27.694
I learn fast.
I'll follow the rules.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.260
Okay, cool.

25:30.294 --> 25:33.827
(whispering):
"Les quatre capacités arcanes

25:33.860 --> 25:35.660
"de celui

25:35.694 --> 25:39.160
connu comme la clé."

25:39.194 --> 25:40.994
"The four

25:41.027 --> 25:44.094
"arcane abilities...

25:44.127 --> 25:46.894
of the one known as The Key."
(soft breathing)

25:46.927 --> 25:49.927
I have four arcane abilities?
(low growling)

25:58.927 --> 26:00.427
What are you doing?

26:01.394 --> 26:04.060
Oh, I was just identifying

26:04.094 --> 26:06.060
the French dialect

26:06.094 --> 26:08.494
used in this volume.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.860
This is by far the oldest piece
in the collection.

26:10.894 --> 26:12.360
Yes.

26:12.394 --> 26:14.094
I had no idea
it was even here.

26:14.127 --> 26:17.260
The colophon identifies the city
of origin as Marseilles.

26:17.294 --> 26:18.760
You're weren't
handling it properly.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.927
Not handling it properly?

26:21.960 --> 26:24.394
This volume should
be in a dehumidifier.

26:24.427 --> 26:26.827
We have one at the special
collections library.

26:26.860 --> 26:27.927
Are you crazy?

26:27.960 --> 26:30.060
This is an illuminated
manuscript.

26:30.094 --> 26:31.560
You'll dry out the parchment,

26:31.594 --> 26:33.094
the ink will separate,

26:33.127 --> 26:35.094
you'll destroy it.
I'm taking this

26:35.127 --> 26:38.027
with me. I'll send
for the rest Monday.
(low whooshing)

26:39.594 --> 26:42.927
(grunting)
Mm.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.594
Maybe you weren't handling
it properly, Dr. Foster.

26:45.627 --> 26:48.194
If anything happens
to this volume

26:48.227 --> 26:49.694
between now and Monday,

26:49.727 --> 26:53.227
I'm holding you
responsible.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.927
(low whooshing)

27:06.760 --> 27:08.560
Hi.
(gasps)

27:08.594 --> 27:11.194
I really wish you would stop
sneaking up on me, Frederick.

27:11.227 --> 27:13.894
I wasn't sneaking, I was
just looking for Mom.

27:13.927 --> 27:15.560
We're over there.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.727
Oh, I, uh... I found
this on the porch.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.427
Is it yours?

27:23.460 --> 27:25.760
Thank you.

27:25.794 --> 27:27.794
You're welcome.

27:32.094 --> 27:33.560
Ma'am.

27:33.594 --> 27:35.494
It's nice
to see you again.

27:35.527 --> 27:37.727
You know, we haven't
been formally introduced.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.027
Tommy Cole.

27:39.060 --> 27:40.494
Not interested.

27:40.527 --> 27:42.260
Oh. No, but yesterday

27:42.294 --> 27:44.027
it kind of seemed
like we were clicking.

27:44.060 --> 27:46.060
No, we were fighting.
But you liked it.

27:46.094 --> 27:47.427
And so did I.

27:47.460 --> 27:49.427
So you don't
want to maybe

27:49.460 --> 27:51.160
spar a little now?
(chuckles)
Just...

27:51.194 --> 27:53.560
be honest‐‐ you have someone
in your life, don't you?

27:53.594 --> 27:55.194
Daddy.
Some...

27:55.227 --> 27:56.994
Daddy, come on, let's
play water guns.
Hey.

27:57.027 --> 27:58.260
Yes.

27:58.294 --> 28:00.427
Okay. You nailed me.

28:00.460 --> 28:01.994
Yeah.
This is my daughter,
Katie.

28:02.027 --> 28:04.060
And her mom dropped
her off this morning.

28:04.094 --> 28:06.060
We're together for the
weekend. I'll tell you what,

28:06.094 --> 28:09.027
go fill the water guns,
and I'll be there in a second.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.060
So you're divorced?

28:11.094 --> 28:12.560
Uh, separated.

28:12.594 --> 28:14.827
But, you know, we're
headed that way.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.094
Why‐‐ is that
a deal breaker?

28:17.127 --> 28:20.360
I guess I'm just
not used to baggage.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.994
Right. Other people's baggage.

28:23.027 --> 28:25.827
We've all got something.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.827
"Happy families
are all alike;

28:27.860 --> 28:30.494
every unhappy family is
unhappy in its own way."

28:30.527 --> 28:32.594
You just quoted Tolstoy.

28:32.627 --> 28:35.827
(gasps) The EMT is
full of surprises.

28:35.860 --> 28:37.727
Who knew?
(chuckles)
Yeah. Huh.

28:37.760 --> 28:40.027
Okay, look, I like you.

28:40.060 --> 28:43.027
So if you want to get
together sometime...

28:43.060 --> 28:45.827
my number's 911.

28:45.860 --> 28:47.894
No.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.427
You did not just do that.

28:50.460 --> 28:53.494
Yeah.
Wow.

28:53.527 --> 28:55.527
(indistinct chatter)

29:13.427 --> 29:15.427
♪ ♪

29:38.060 --> 29:40.394
Thank you.
Long line.

29:40.427 --> 29:43.060
Where's Frederick?
What do you mean?

29:43.094 --> 29:45.660
I just saw him a few minutes
ago. He was looking for you.

29:45.694 --> 29:47.427
I haven't seen him.

29:47.460 --> 29:48.894
Huh.
(low whooshing)

29:48.927 --> 29:50.227
(inhales sharply)

29:50.260 --> 29:51.860
You seriously don't feel that?

29:53.894 --> 29:55.894
Fine, take it.

30:02.594 --> 30:04.360
(rustling)

30:11.894 --> 30:13.760
(rustling)
(Foster screaming)

30:25.926 --> 30:27.393
Repeat after me.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.593
Chango. Yemaya.

30:30.626 --> 30:33.126
Ochun.

30:33.159 --> 30:34.259
Chango.

30:34.293 --> 30:36.626
Yemaya.

30:36.659 --> 30:38.126
Ochun.

30:38.159 --> 30:39.759
Again.

30:41.759 --> 30:43.726
Chango.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.093
Yemaya. Ochun.

30:46.126 --> 30:47.726
Keep going.

30:47.759 --> 30:51.026
Chango. Yemaya. Ochun.

30:52.493 --> 30:54.459
Call the spirit to you.

30:54.493 --> 30:56.893
Espíritu venga a mí.

30:56.926 --> 30:59.659
Espíritu venga a mí.
(gasps)

31:21.126 --> 31:23.426
What the hell was that?

31:23.459 --> 31:25.426
I knew it.

31:25.459 --> 31:28.893
This proves it.

31:28.926 --> 31:31.226
You are brujo.

31:31.259 --> 31:32.793
You have
the gift.

31:32.826 --> 31:35.559
No. I don't understand.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.959
If I have this gift,
how can I go my whole life

31:37.993 --> 31:39.493
without ever realizing...

31:39.526 --> 31:42.826
Maybe you needed
to find someone like you.

31:43.859 --> 31:47.059
So you could
be awakened.

31:47.093 --> 31:49.659
You, too?

31:49.693 --> 31:53.426
Of course.
Of course.

31:53.459 --> 31:55.393
Ever since I met you,
I've sensed it.

31:55.426 --> 31:57.126
We're the same.

31:57.159 --> 32:00.626
I think that's why
we found each other.

32:00.659 --> 32:03.459
We're meant to
be together.

32:14.759 --> 32:17.159
(panting)

32:31.426 --> 32:33.626
Hey. How 'bout another beer?

32:33.659 --> 32:36.159
I'll be right with you, sir.
I've only got three arms.

32:36.193 --> 32:37.526
That's what you said
ten minutes ago.

32:38.526 --> 32:40.493
Hey. I want my beer.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.959
I think maybe you've had enough.
Let's get you some food.

32:42.993 --> 32:45.259
Can we get a burger
on the house, please?

32:45.293 --> 32:46.626
I didn't ask for a burger.

32:46.659 --> 32:47.993
I told you...

32:48.026 --> 32:49.826
I want my beer.
Hey. Let go of me!

32:49.859 --> 32:51.593
(grunts)
(bystanders gasp)

32:51.626 --> 32:53.126
(yelps)
Frederick, stop!

32:53.159 --> 32:54.393
Frederick, stop.

32:54.426 --> 32:55.393
Let him go!

32:55.426 --> 32:56.993
Let him go!

32:57.026 --> 32:58.259
(coughing)

32:58.293 --> 33:00.259
Wait, Frederick.
Please, stop.

33:00.293 --> 33:02.793
(Freya speaking distantly,
man groaning)

33:02.826 --> 33:04.426
Come on. Come on.

33:04.459 --> 33:06.926
Come on. Please.

33:06.959 --> 33:09.426
Frederick! Stop! Let him go!

33:09.459 --> 33:12.726
(gasps)
Okay. Okay.

33:12.759 --> 33:14.059
(gasping)

33:14.093 --> 33:16.059
Just stay calm.

33:16.093 --> 33:18.659
Stay calm, okay?

33:18.693 --> 33:20.493
It's okay.

33:20.526 --> 33:22.159
Okay.

33:22.193 --> 33:23.659
Good to see you.
Yeah, you, too.

33:23.693 --> 33:25.759
Happy Fourth of July.

33:25.793 --> 33:27.593
Ingrid.

33:27.626 --> 33:29.593
Dash. Hi.

33:29.626 --> 33:31.426
Hi. Sorry. I don't mean
to be bothering you.

33:31.459 --> 33:33.626
No, no, it's okay.
I'm just, um...

33:33.659 --> 33:35.393
How are you?

33:35.426 --> 33:37.126
Uh, I've been better.

33:37.159 --> 33:39.959
I am so sorry to hear
about‐about everything.

33:39.993 --> 33:41.593
Your mother and...
Thank you.

33:41.626 --> 33:43.326
Look, you don't have
to apologize for anything.

33:43.359 --> 33:45.159
I know, but still.

33:45.193 --> 33:47.159
Um, Ingrid, this is...

33:47.193 --> 33:49.159
this is gonna
sound really weird.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.826
Okay? Really weird. But...

33:50.859 --> 33:52.493
I've been wanting
to ask you something.

33:52.526 --> 33:53.759
Um, okay.

33:53.793 --> 33:55.659
I have this patient
at the hospital.

33:55.693 --> 33:59.159
Okay? And he's been having
these really strange symptoms.

33:59.193 --> 34:01.793
So we gave him an MRI and...

34:01.826 --> 34:05.593
we noticed these very rare
anomalies in his brain mapping.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.993
As it turns out, we've
only had one other patient

34:09.026 --> 34:10.893
who had similar
anomalies.

34:10.926 --> 34:12.893
Um...

34:12.926 --> 34:14.926
that patient was you.

34:14.959 --> 34:16.726
Me?

34:16.759 --> 34:18.293
Yeah. Apparently we ran the scan

34:18.326 --> 34:19.993
because you were brought in
with a concussion.

34:20.026 --> 34:22.159
The file says you fell
off a jungle gym.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.093
Right. Yes.
In third grade.

34:24.126 --> 34:26.826
I‐I do remember.
My mother was so upset

34:26.859 --> 34:28.659
when she got
to the hospital.
I'm just curious

34:28.693 --> 34:31.326
if you remember having
any strange symptoms yourself.

34:31.359 --> 34:32.593
Either before the accident

34:32.626 --> 34:33.926
or after.

34:33.959 --> 34:36.926
No. No strange symptoms at all.

34:36.959 --> 34:38.726
So...
Nope.

34:38.759 --> 34:41.626
Everything's been
really totally super‐normal

34:41.659 --> 34:42.893
ever since then.

34:42.926 --> 34:44.826
Ingrid, I am not trying
to pry, really.

34:44.859 --> 34:47.093
But if you experienced
anything at all,

34:47.126 --> 34:49.059
it's extremely important
that you tell me. I...
FOSTER: He's here!

34:49.093 --> 34:51.826
Dr. Foster.

34:51.859 --> 34:52.926
He walks among us!

34:52.959 --> 34:53.926
He's carving

34:53.959 --> 34:56.226
the ancient symbol of the king!

34:56.259 --> 34:59.959
This is a warning to us all!

34:59.993 --> 35:03.093
(moaning)

35:03.126 --> 35:05.493
(bystanders gasp)
Oh, my God.

35:06.759 --> 35:08.693
(gasping, shouting)

35:14.826 --> 35:16.659
Dr. Foster.

35:22.759 --> 35:24.793
Go ahead.
(siren chirps)

35:24.826 --> 35:26.159
(siren wailing)
Hey.

35:26.193 --> 35:27.726
Hey.
I missed the show.

35:27.759 --> 35:29.393
Yeah. I'm glad I'm
not on duty today.

35:29.426 --> 35:30.626
What happened?

35:30.659 --> 35:32.293
Just... Guy lost his mind.

35:32.326 --> 35:34.126
Started blabbing a
bunch of nonsense.

35:34.159 --> 35:35.326
What kind of nonsense?

35:35.359 --> 35:36.593
I don't know.
Just crazy nonsense.

35:36.626 --> 35:37.959
Do you know what
the strangest part is?

35:37.993 --> 35:40.393
Two days ago, I brought in
a guy to the ER.

35:40.426 --> 35:42.559
And exact same routine‐‐
the wounds, the ranting...

35:42.593 --> 35:43.993
Wait, wounds?

35:44.026 --> 35:45.493
Yeah, he was
all carved up

35:45.526 --> 35:47.593
like some sort
of voodoo‐looking shit.

35:47.626 --> 35:49.626
There's a serious sicko
out there.

35:49.659 --> 35:51.759
What do you mean, voodoo?

35:51.793 --> 35:54.826
(sighs)
He had a... shape or something
carved into his chest.

35:54.859 --> 35:56.559
It looked satanic.

35:56.593 --> 35:58.626
Okay, what was he ranting about?

35:59.993 --> 36:01.559
Why are you so interested
in all this?

36:01.593 --> 36:03.626
'Cause it's...
I got to tell you,

36:03.659 --> 36:05.426
it's creeping me out just...
I'm sorry.

36:05.459 --> 36:06.993
a tiny bit.
I guess
I'm just sort of fascinated

36:07.026 --> 36:08.559
by voodoo. Like...
Wow.

36:08.593 --> 36:10.759
I'm drawn to the dark side.
You're drawn?

36:10.793 --> 36:12.093
Okay.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.959
Yeah, I got a lot of stories.

36:13.993 --> 36:15.126
You do?
Yeah.

36:15.159 --> 36:16.626
Maybe...
tell them to you

36:16.659 --> 36:18.426
over drinks?

36:18.459 --> 36:21.059
I'll think about it.

36:21.093 --> 36:23.559
Okay. Just don't think
about it too long.

36:23.593 --> 36:26.093
If there's anything
I learned from this job,

36:26.126 --> 36:29.559
it's that life is short.
You only get one.

36:29.593 --> 36:31.959
Yeah, don't remind me.

36:34.759 --> 36:37.159
♪ ♪

36:44.359 --> 36:46.093
Hey.
FREYA:
Hey.

36:46.126 --> 36:47.726
I just got
your message.

36:47.759 --> 36:48.893
What's going on?

36:48.926 --> 36:50.159
I don't know.

36:50.193 --> 36:51.793
Something happened.
It was scary.

36:51.826 --> 36:54.893
Frederick,
are you okay?

36:54.926 --> 36:57.659
This guy grabbed Freya,
and, uh...

36:57.693 --> 36:59.359
I just, uh...
He was protecting me.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.059
Very aggressively.

37:02.093 --> 37:03.326
I'm sorry.

37:03.359 --> 37:06.059
I've spent so much
time fighting

37:06.093 --> 37:07.893
for my life, sometimes I...

37:07.926 --> 37:09.926
I just lose control.

37:09.959 --> 37:11.659
(sighs)

37:14.126 --> 37:16.026
(thunder crashing)

37:24.826 --> 37:26.893
Well, that wasn't
the most joyous

37:26.926 --> 37:29.426
of Fourth of July celebrations
in history.

37:29.459 --> 37:31.993
Are you okay?

37:32.026 --> 37:33.626
Yes.

37:34.759 --> 37:36.093
Um,

37:36.126 --> 37:39.093
I have an announcement
to make.

37:39.126 --> 37:42.726
As you all know, there have been
a lot of changes around here.

37:42.759 --> 37:45.293
But there have also been
a lot of changes

37:45.326 --> 37:46.626
with me.

37:46.659 --> 37:48.393
I don't know what it means

37:48.426 --> 37:50.326
that I'm the key,
beyond the fact

37:50.359 --> 37:52.993
that I can open a portal
to another dimension,

37:53.026 --> 37:55.126
but I'm ready
to figure it out.

37:55.159 --> 37:57.426
And I love my new job.
Even though

37:57.459 --> 37:58.759
my boss just died. But...

37:58.793 --> 38:01.559
the point is,
I'm not the same person

38:01.593 --> 38:03.626
that I was, in this life

38:03.659 --> 38:06.559
or in others. And I think
the sleepwalking,

38:06.593 --> 38:08.626
it's actually been my
subconscious trying to tell me

38:08.659 --> 38:11.293
that it's time
to take the next step,

38:11.326 --> 38:13.793
so...
Oh, my God. You are
worse than Mom.

38:13.826 --> 38:15.259
Spill it.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.493
Hey.

38:16.526 --> 38:18.293
I'm moving out.

38:18.326 --> 38:20.593
Wait, what?
Are you seri...

38:20.626 --> 38:22.226
What is wrong?
No, Mom,

38:22.259 --> 38:23.459
nothing is wrong.

38:23.493 --> 38:24.926
Everything is right.
It's just...

38:24.959 --> 38:27.993
it's time for me
to stand on my own.

38:28.026 --> 38:29.293
And now Frederick

38:29.326 --> 38:31.159
will have somewhere
to sleep.

38:31.193 --> 38:34.459
(phone chimes)

38:34.493 --> 38:36.893
(Ingrid laughs,
Joanna speaks indistinctly)

38:36.926 --> 38:38.759
Mom.
FREDERICK:
Well, I think this calls

38:38.793 --> 38:40.093
for a toast.

38:40.126 --> 38:42.326
Aw.
I won't be far.

38:42.359 --> 38:44.493
(laughs)

38:44.526 --> 38:45.659
FREDERICK:
To Ingrid!

38:45.693 --> 38:48.226
Aw.

38:48.259 --> 38:51.259
Too bad we missed
the fireworks, right?

38:51.293 --> 38:53.726
Cheers.
Shall we do the honors?

38:53.759 --> 38:55.293
Yes.
(chuckles)

38:58.993 --> 39:00.793
Oh, thank you.
Cheers.

39:00.826 --> 39:01.826
(glasses clink)

39:03.126 --> 39:04.726
INGRID: You ready?
FREYA: Mm‐hmm.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.893
(inhaling deeply)

39:06.926 --> 39:09.426
BOTH:
Caelum combure.

39:09.459 --> 39:10.826
Caelum
combure.

39:10.859 --> 39:13.659
(fireworks exploding)
Caelum combure.

39:13.693 --> 39:15.893
Caelum
combure.

39:15.926 --> 39:18.126
(laughs)

39:18.159 --> 39:21.059
Wow.
It worked.

39:21.093 --> 39:22.726
(exploding, whizzing)

39:22.759 --> 39:24.559
INGRID:
Wow.

39:24.593 --> 39:28.259
(Ingrid and Freya laughing)

39:28.293 --> 39:30.993
Five minutes. I have everyone
together for five minutes

39:31.026 --> 39:32.759
and now this.

39:32.793 --> 39:34.593
Two deaths,
Joanna.

39:34.626 --> 39:36.493
One of them Ingrid's boss.
And?

39:36.526 --> 39:39.759
And the EMT said there was
some full‐on voodoo shit.

39:39.793 --> 39:42.493
And what does that mean?
It means that...

39:42.526 --> 39:44.926
we were looking for Frederick
right before it happened.

39:44.959 --> 39:46.659
He said he was trying
to find you.

39:46.693 --> 39:49.926
Wendy, please.
Frederick didn't attack anyone.

39:49.959 --> 39:52.759
Yes, he did. You said
it yourself. He attacked
the drunk guy at the bar.

39:52.793 --> 39:55.726
Oh, who was messing with Freya.
And Ingrid's boss
was messing with her.

39:55.759 --> 39:57.293
There is a pattern here.
We can't ignore it.

39:57.326 --> 39:59.093
I know my son.

39:59.126 --> 40:02.993
I know what he's capable of,
but even at his worst,

40:03.026 --> 40:04.159
he's not a killer.

40:05.193 --> 40:07.193
(Ingrid and Freya laugh)

40:08.259 --> 40:11.326
Mm.
(chuckles)

40:11.359 --> 40:12.959
Cold?

40:12.993 --> 40:14.559
(gasps)

40:14.593 --> 40:15.993
Frederick.

40:16.026 --> 40:17.826
I know how you feel about me,
Aunt Wendy.

40:17.859 --> 40:19.826
Do you?
And I don't
blame you.

40:19.859 --> 40:21.659
You've got it all wrong.

40:21.693 --> 40:23.759
You think you know me.

40:23.793 --> 40:26.459
But I promise you,
you don't.

40:28.859 --> 40:31.659
Come back
to the party.

40:31.693 --> 40:35.293
I love
these fireworks.

40:35.326 --> 40:38.326
(chuckles)
Oh, thank God.
(chuckles)

40:38.359 --> 40:40.459
(Joanna speaking indistinctly)

40:40.493 --> 40:42.859
(Ingrid, Joanna, Freya laughing)

40:47.993 --> 40:49.793
(distant thunder rumbling)

40:49.826 --> 40:52.859
(phone ringing)

40:58.659 --> 41:00.626
This is Dr. Gardiner.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.959
(digitally altered male voice):
You did very well today.
Thank you.

41:02.993 --> 41:04.793
You're welcome.

41:04.826 --> 41:06.093
Now go to hell.

41:06.126 --> 41:08.626
Hold on.
Today was just a down payment.

41:08.659 --> 41:11.393
The next installment
will be $100,000.

41:11.426 --> 41:13.126
What do you mean the next one?

41:13.159 --> 41:15.126
I'll call you again
with further instructions.

41:15.159 --> 41:18.226
Good night, Dr. Gardiner.

41:18.259 --> 41:19.426
(grunts)

41:29.259 --> 41:31.193
(crackling)

41:36.959 --> 41:38.926
(panting)

41:44.826 --> 41:48.459
You know what to do next.
