I’ve got a question for you, Just/n.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.452
Not the one you th/h/c Not yet.

-I/l/hat’5 the best part of high school?

01:05.480 --> 01:07.300
It’s the great reset button.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.391
And after everything that happened
to me sophomore year...

01:13.030 --> 01:14.941
I cou/o’n ’t wait to start fresh.. .

01:16.150 --> 01:19.062
to tear the rest of the pages
from my journal and forget it a//.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.088
At work, my usual partner in cr/me

01:36.170 --> 01:38.547
was spending the summer
with his grandparents.

01:39.300 --> 01:43.964
l-/is temporary replacement was
nice enough, but entirely too normal.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.760
[girls giggling]

01:46.850 --> 01:48.590
And I cou/dn ’t escape my past.

01:48.690 --> 01:51.056
No, we didn't make a switch. You did.

01:51.150 --> 01:53.186
-And you didn't discuss it with me!
-Listen, listen!

01:53.280 --> 01:56.022
The way we do business
is making good decisions...

01:56.110 --> 01:57.816
[Hannah]
I needed a change.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.941
I needed to be someone new.

02:01.030 --> 02:03.032
[argument continues indistinctly]

02:04.200 --> 02:05.747
Have you ever felt l/ke that?

02:12.710 --> 02:15.338
I wasn ’1‘ going to be in vis/b/e anymore.

02:16.090 --> 02:18.297
I was going to start brand new.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.210
[door opens]

02:26.180 --> 02:28.512
I was going to cut away the past...

02:32.150 --> 02:33.606
and leave it all behind.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.690
I was going to work harder.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.205
Be smarter.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.585
And be stronger.

03:09.850 --> 03:12.182
Because you can ’t change other people,

03:12.270 --> 03:13.976
but you can change yourself?

03:14.520 --> 03:17.683
No, so now she's trying to punish me
by giving all of my stunts

03:17.780 --> 03:19.350
to this 80-pound freshman.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.558
Go ahead. You really think that
she can lift Melanie Opstad's fat ass

03:23.660 --> 03:25.230
into pyramid formation?

03:26.160 --> 03:27.616
She's fucking fat!

03:27.700 --> 03:28.906
Really, good luck!

03:29.200 --> 03:30.610
Your coach is such a bitch.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.328
She's actually cool as long as people
show up to practice.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.080
-Oh!
-[Jessica] All right.

03:36.170 --> 03:38.547
It's cheerleading, it's not saving lives.

03:38.630 --> 03:40.416
Anyone down for a little pick-me-up?

03:43.260 --> 03:44.670
Oh, shit.

03:45.390 --> 03:46.755
[Jessica chuckles]

03:46.970 --> 03:48.210
Is this vodka?

03:48.970 --> 03:50.722
Since when do you drink at school?

03:51.640 --> 03:54.188
Since when do you ever
turn down a drink?

03:54.270 --> 03:55.646
[Jessica] Mm-hmm.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.014
Come on, Zachariah.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.566
There's no strawberry.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.982
Uh, nah, I got a test in bio.

04:04.030 --> 04:05.986
Don't be a bitch, Justy.

04:07.490 --> 04:08.866
There you go.

04:08.950 --> 04:09.826
Thattaboy.

04:11.410 --> 04:12.900
-This tastes like shit.
-It's smooth.

04:16.920 --> 04:17.875
All right.

04:17.960 --> 04:21.123
I gotta go copy my Spanish homework
before the bell rings.

04:21.210 --> 04:22.370
Adios, losers.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.676
-See ya.
-See ya.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.624
Ready?

04:33.730 --> 04:35.220
Hey, Jessica.

04:35.310 --> 04:36.220
Jessica.

04:37.020 --> 04:40.023
-I heard the tape about your party.
-Seriously? Haven't you figured it out?

04:40.110 --> 04:41.566
Those tapes are bullshit.

04:41.650 --> 04:43.481
-I don't think they are.
-Move on.

04:43.570 --> 04:45.060
-Tell me why.
-Move on.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.024
No.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.441
My God! Okay, fine. Come here.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.360
Seriously, Clay?

04:54.710 --> 04:55.779
Get over it.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.491
It was you she was talking about, right?

04:58.590 --> 05:01.878
-Because if it was, I want to help, okay?
-[scoffs]

05:01.960 --> 05:04.758
We need to do something about it.
Tell someone.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.252
That night did not happen
the way Hannah said.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.795
Then how did it happen?

05:08.890 --> 05:10.551
I hooked up with my boyfriend.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.766
[laughs]

05:19.190 --> 05:20.509
-With Justin.
-Yeah.

05:20.980 --> 05:21.969
With Justin.

05:22.070 --> 05:23.935
Hannah said you were completely out of it.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.941
She said things happened.

05:26.030 --> 05:27.520
If something happened, I'd remember it.

05:29.740 --> 05:31.321
We were both pretty drunk,

05:31.410 --> 05:34.288
so we basically just passed out after.

05:34.370 --> 05:36.747
Justin told you that, or you remember?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.326
I remember.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.699
Okay?

05:43.380 --> 05:44.335
So back off.

05:49.050 --> 05:50.756
Stay the fuck away from my girlfriend.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.670
-Let's go.
-Who was it, Justin?

05:53.310 --> 05:54.129
Who did it?

05:54.220 --> 05:56.518
-Did what?
-Fuck him. Let's go.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.932
Mind your own fucking business,
you got it?

05:59.020 --> 06:01.102
-Come on. I know.
-What the fuck is his problem?

06:10.660 --> 06:11.524
Mr. Baker.

06:15.330 --> 06:16.740
Okay, uh...

06:17.750 --> 06:18.660
what can I do for you?

06:18.750 --> 06:21.378
You say the school had no idea
my daughter was suicidal,

06:21.460 --> 06:23.667
but you published a poem
in that school paper

06:23.750 --> 06:25.661
that says exactly what she was feeling.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.619
Okay, hang on.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.045
[closes door]

06:31.140 --> 06:34.632
Um... This isn't a school-sanctioned
publication.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.803
This is one of the stu_dents'
Independent art prOJects.

06:37.890 --> 06:39.096
It's distributed on campus.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.476
Teachers were discussing
this poem in class

06:41.560 --> 06:44.723
when they should have been
getting help for the kid that wrote it.

06:44.820 --> 06:48.142
Okay, to be fair,
this was published anonymously.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.105
Did anyone try to find out who wrote it?

06:50.950 --> 06:53.327
Or ask whoever it is that put it in there?

06:53.410 --> 06:54.729
Mr. Baker,

06:54.830 --> 06:57.537
this doesn't seem to be
talking about suicide.

06:57.620 --> 06:58.746
Are you serious?

06:58.910 --> 07:02.664
She talks about drowning
with stones tied to her feet.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.706
She talks about being lost for good.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.006
Mr. Baker...

07:10.720 --> 07:13.006
a lot of teens talk about being lost.

07:13.510 --> 07:15.592
Well, God help them if they come to you.

07:16.640 --> 07:17.516
Mr. Baker.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.431
[Mrs. Bradley]
Good morning, everyone.

07:23.520 --> 07:27.308
I have your results from yesterday's
personality questionnaire.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.107
So let's see what we've got, shall we?

07:32.240 --> 07:34.447
-Excuse me, Mrs. Bradley?
-Yes, Clay.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.784
Um, about what I said yesterday,
about Hannah writing that note.

07:40.580 --> 07:41.615
Well, I...

07:41.710 --> 07:43.780
I wasn't trying to say it was your fault,

07:43.880 --> 07:46.166
and I wanted to apologize for being rude.

07:46.710 --> 07:48.450
Well, that's very--

07:48.550 --> 07:50.711
'Cause people need to take responsibility
for their actions...

07:53.130 --> 07:55.098
and face the consequences,
one way or another.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.301
Okay. Thank you, Clay.

08:00.480 --> 08:05.725
Uh, so, let's get to the rest
of these results. [clears throat]

08:15.620 --> 08:16.484
[Hannah] Hey, Helmet.

08:17.410 --> 08:20.322
Sorry I'm late,
on gum-scraping day of all days.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.326
Hope you saved some good ones.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.610
You snooze, you lose.

08:26.670 --> 08:27.489
What?

08:29.460 --> 08:30.916
What are you staring at?

08:31.630 --> 08:33.370
Ah, nothing. Nah, sorry.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.382
I saved you a particularly
gnarly piece with some hair in it.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.302
Here I thought I was a flowers
and chocolates kind of girl.

08:47.230 --> 08:50.609
So, uh, are you going
to that party tonight

08:50.690 --> 08:52.271
at Jessica Davis's house?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.987
Since when do you go to parties?

08:54.070 --> 08:56.402
Well, since Jeff told me I had to come.

08:56.490 --> 08:59.482
He's assured me it will be
the highlight of my high school career.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.198
Why can't people swallow their gum,
like when we were kids?

09:03.290 --> 09:06.032
-I never swallowed my gum.
-Of course you didn't.

09:06.620 --> 09:07.700
The rest of us.

09:13.550 --> 09:17.589
You know, the party could be
the highlight of your high school career.

09:18.010 --> 09:19.295
Yeah, I doubt it.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.592
Nope, it's part of my fresh start.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.590
No more parties, no more slacking off.

09:26.140 --> 09:29.689
That's crazy. Because this is the year
I'm gonna start slacking off.

09:30.690 --> 09:32.851
You gonna start riding your bike
sans helmet?

09:33.650 --> 09:34.605
Iam.

09:34.690 --> 09:36.442
Gonna turn in a project late?

09:36.530 --> 09:37.406
Uh...

09:37.950 --> 09:38.939
Maybe.

09:40.660 --> 09:41.945
No, I'm not gonna do that.

09:42.870 --> 09:45.532
But I might half-ass a paper
now and again.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.030
Whoa. Careful there.

09:49.170 --> 09:50.239
You should come.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.991
It might be cool to actually hang out

09:53.090 --> 09:55.718
when we're not both
covered In chewmg gum.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.256
Don't be an enabler.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.427
I made a deal with myself.

10:00.510 --> 10:01.545
I'll watch out for you.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.766
One beer, max.

10:03.850 --> 10:06.808
Home by midnight, even ifI have
to pedal you home on my bike.

10:09.230 --> 10:10.219
[sighs]

10:10.310 --> 10:11.390
I don't think so.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.816
["Under the Spell" playing]

10:19.910 --> 10:23.118

Part of me knew I shou/dn ’t go
to Jessica ’5 house that n/ght.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.668
But another part of me cou/dn ’t help
but wonder what...

10:32.040 --> 10:33.951
or who...

10:34.050 --> 10:35.950

They're not gonna shut our power off
because of one late payment.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.827
I don't like it.
We have to find another way to save.

11:05.910 --> 11:08.322
Well, maybe we can get
Hannah to pitch in--

Hey, Mom.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.665
Hey.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.877
I almost didn't recognize you.

11:18.340 --> 11:21.173
Reminds me when you were little,
with those floppy pigtails.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.217
Okay, so I'm gonna heat up
some leftovers.

11:27.470 --> 11:28.846
I'm not really hungry.

11:28.930 --> 11:29.806
No?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.932
Actually, there's this
back to school party

11:34.020 --> 11:35.976
at Jessica Davis's house tonight.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.850
But I don't have to go
if you don't want me to.

11:38.940 --> 11:40.646
It's Saturday night. Go have fun.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.488
I do have homework
I need to get done by Monday.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.288
And I was gonna try and get ahead
on the syllabus.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.031
Oh, Hannah, go, don't go.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.747
I don't know. It's up to you.

11:52.170 --> 11:56.243
I really think staying open later
will help us stay competitive.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.797
[Mr. Baker] It's not going to help at all.
We're not a Walplex.

We can't stay open...

12:18.980 --> 12:20.481
What do you want, Marcus?

12:20.820 --> 12:23.391
Did you and Tony talk yesterday?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.610
We sure did.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.270
Okay, and you're just...

12:27.990 --> 12:29.730
doing your own thing.

12:29.830 --> 12:31.286
Oh, more than ever.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.998
Okay. Okay, look, I understand

12:36.080 --> 12:39.083
that you're going through
your own process or whatever,

12:39.170 --> 12:41.752
but I'm worried about you, man.

12:43.050 --> 12:44.790
I don't want to see you get hurt.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.176
Yeah, I'm sure you don't.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.512
Hey, I'm trying to protect you, okay?

12:51.600 --> 12:54.683
But I can't if you keep
running your mouth.

12:54.770 --> 12:56.340
I mean, what's your play here, anyway?

12:59.730 --> 13:00.685

13:01.990 --> 13:02.934
Like it's a game?

Okay.

13:04.110 --> 13:05.486
You threw rocks through Tyler's window.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.231
What did you do for Jessica?

-Don't touch me.

13:13.540 --> 13:18.125
Look, maybe Jessica's managed
to convince herself nothing happened,

13:18.210 --> 13:20.121
but if she's not gonna do anything,
I will.

13:20.210 --> 13:23.543
Listen, no one knows
if those tapes are telling the truth.

13:24.010 --> 13:26.547
And Jessica said nothing happened.

13:26.630 --> 13:28.541
No court of law's gonna
listen to a case where--

13:28.640 --> 13:29.925
I'll start with the school.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.671
You don't know what the f...

13:33.520 --> 13:35.169
You don't know what you're doing.

13:35.810 --> 13:38.552
Okay? You haven't even listened
to your own tape.

13:38.650 --> 13:41.642
I'm telling you, the worst is yet to come.

13:51.530 --> 13:52.906
Yo, Alex.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.576
Hang back a second.

13:56.330 --> 13:57.820
We need to talk about Clay.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.820
Haven't we already talked about that?

13:59.920 --> 14:01.660
Is your stomach thing happening again?

14:02.630 --> 14:05.167
-Hey, I said hang back.
-Just leave him alone, okay?

14:05.260 --> 14:06.375
Hey, you're a part of this.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.541
You're in it, even if you are
the pussy Hannah said.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.504
Fuck you.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.592
You're calling me a pussy,
after what you did, or didn't do?

14:13.680 --> 14:14.760
-Fuck you.
-Fuck you.

14:15.810 --> 14:16.845
Cut it out!

14:20.900 --> 14:23.141
Whatever happens to us happens to you too.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.140
IfI kill myself, you die too?

14:25.230 --> 14:26.060
Guys.

14:26.860 --> 14:27.940
Seriously.

14:33.030 --> 14:35.282
God, what's with him now?

14:36.540 --> 14:37.780
Don't worry about it.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.199
What did Clay say?

14:43.290 --> 14:45.087
He's freaking out about Jessica.

14:45.170 --> 14:48.298
He says he's gonna do something,
maybe here at school.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.466
[Zach]
If he tells Mr. Porter, or Childs...

14:51.550 --> 14:52.596
[Marcus] We're all fucked.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.056
We have to get to them before he does.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.936
[Hannah]
I thought maybe starting over

15:08.030 --> 15:10.988
didn ’t have to mean
cutting myself oﬁr complete/y.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.986
Maybe I ’0' been hanging
with the wrong people.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.828
Maybe I could start over
with the n'ght person.

15:24.670 --> 15:27.582
But ifI’d have known
what was going to happen,

15:27.670 --> 15:30.002
I never would have walked
through that door.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.435
Hey...

15:47.440 --> 15:48.429
is everything okay?

15:51.530 --> 15:54.192
Clay listened to the tape about my party.

15:54.990 --> 15:57.697
All that bullshit Hannah said.
Of course he believes it.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.327
He said he wants to help me.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.417
So, whatever Tony did didn't work.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.740
Apparently not.

16:07.670 --> 16:11.254
If Hannah had seen something,
she would have told me, right?

16:11.880 --> 16:12.960
[locker closes]

16:14.090 --> 16:17.093
I mean, we both know
she made all that stuff up.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.515
Did she?

16:21.230 --> 16:24.518
Because that photo of her
on the slide with Justin was real.

16:25.270 --> 16:27.818
The "Hot or Not" list was real, so...

16:27.900 --> 16:29.390
maybe the rest was too.

16:36.410 --> 16:37.229
[grunts]

16:38.490 --> 16:39.320
Jessica...

16:40.620 --> 16:42.110
Justin is your boyfriend.

16:42.870 --> 16:45.247
Who are you going to believe, him or...

16:46.330 --> 16:49.333
a girl who was jealous
because you were dating her ex?

17:01.180 --> 17:02.306
[knocks]

17:02.390 --> 17:03.266
Hey.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.556
Hey.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.859
Hey, um, Justin said
you might have a little herb on you?

17:08.230 --> 17:10.357
-l/l/hat are you,
2] Jump Street
?
-[chuckles]

17:10.440 --> 17:12.067
Since when do you smoke at school?

17:12.400 --> 17:13.435
It's for a friend.

17:13.990 --> 17:15.025
Uh-huh.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.310
Okay.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.059
Come to my house after school.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.400
Nah, I kind of need it now.

17:20.030 --> 17:22.533
I mean, I can hook you up
with my guy here.

17:23.700 --> 17:27.033
Come on, I can't buy on campus.
I'm the student body president.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.872
I'm captain of the football team.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.588
The rules are different for us,
in many ways.

17:31.670 --> 17:32.500
You know it.

17:33.210 --> 17:34.086
Yeah.

17:35.510 --> 17:36.625
Come on...

17:36.800 --> 17:37.926
Fuck. All right.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.880
Come and see me after fifth.

17:39.970 --> 17:40.800
Thank you.

17:40.970 --> 17:41.925
You're welcome.

17:44.390 --> 17:46.551
You showed him the poem?

17:47.650 --> 17:48.548
[scoffs]

17:48.730 --> 17:50.766
Why on earth would you do that?

17:50.860 --> 17:53.522
He walked in here all self-righteous,

17:53.610 --> 17:57.899
telling me we needed counseling,
as if we're delusional.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.868
As if this whole lawsuit
is a big waste of time.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.737
It isn't, we're not,
and I want people to know it.

18:03.830 --> 18:06.492
It was our one piece of leverage, Andy!

18:06.580 --> 18:07.911
You showed him our hand!

18:08.000 --> 18:12.699
Hannah was crying out for help
right under their noses.

18:14.380 --> 18:16.757
And under ours, too.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.922
Uh... Andy, sweetie...

18:21.260 --> 18:25.344
you don't win a chess match

18:25.430 --> 18:27.637
by giving away your strategy, honey.

18:27.730 --> 18:29.846
I'm trying to fight back here!

18:32.860 --> 18:34.521
I thought that's what you wanted.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.566
Not like this.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.286
[door opens]

18:48.460 --> 18:50.246
[Mr. PO/ter]
Hey, Ryan,
thanks for coming in.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.781
I wanted to ask you a question
about this poem.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.664
Oh.

18:58.340 --> 19:00.797
Do you remember where it came from?

19:00.890 --> 19:03.006
Someone slipped it
into my locker last year.

19:03.180 --> 19:06.092
-Hmm.
-Yeah, I thought it was well-written.

19:06.930 --> 19:09.683
So you didn't actually find it on campus.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.397
Isn't that the whole conceit
of the magazme?

19:13.810 --> 19:16.722
Sometimes I get submissions anonymously.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.890
Why are you asking me about this?

19:19.990 --> 19:21.776
It seems that Hannah Baker wrote it.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.444
Oh, my God.

19:25.530 --> 19:28.943
Now her folks aren't too happy
it got passed out around campus.

19:29.870 --> 19:31.417
I had no idea it was Hannah's.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.037
Did you think maybe
the person who wrote this

19:34.130 --> 19:36.041
was thinking about hurting themself?

19:36.710 --> 19:37.699
To be honest,

19:37.800 --> 19:40.542
this isn't the first submission
I've received like this.

19:40.840 --> 19:44.003
Teenage angst, you know?
Perennially popular.

19:45.470 --> 19:49.725
But just because you write something
doesn't mean you're going to do it.

19:49.810 --> 19:50.845
True.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.646
But I'm afraid the administration

19:52.730 --> 19:55.187
can't allow you to publish
tost& Found
anymore.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.239
But I'm working on a memorial issue
dedicated to Hannah Baker.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.355
I get that.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.738
But with her parents bringing a lawsuit,

20:02.820 --> 20:04.276
it's too sensitive right now.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.407
That's unfair.
I built this magazine out of nothing.

20:07.490 --> 20:09.651
It's the focal point of my college apps.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.287
You may be asked to give testimony
about this poem.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.668
That could affect
your college admission too.

20:16.130 --> 20:16.994
I'm sorry.

20:19.050 --> 20:20.711
Sucks to be held accountable.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.835
Doesn't it?

20:24.930 --> 20:25.840
Excuse me?

20:30.770 --> 20:31.668
[door opens]

20:35.020 --> 20:35.896
Hey.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.356
Hey.

20:40.070 --> 20:40.934
Marcus.

20:41.030 --> 20:43.521
Hi, Mr. Porter. Um, you got a moment?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.316
Sure. Do we have an appointment today?

20:45.410 --> 20:49.153
No, Mr. Porter,
but it's actually kind of urgent.

20:49.990 --> 20:50.866
Um...

20:51.290 --> 20:54.669
I'm really worried about Clay Jensen.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.998
[teacher]
”I am in vrs/b/e
understand simply because

20:59.090 --> 21:01.206
people refuse to see me.

21:01.300 --> 21:04.838
When they approach me,
they see only my surroundings,

21:04.930 --> 21:08.252
themselves, or figments
of their imagination...

21:08.350 --> 21:13.344
indeed, everything and anything
except me."

21:14.140 --> 21:15.550
What's the message here?

21:15.640 --> 21:17.688
-What's the author trying to say?
-[door opens]

21:31.200 --> 21:32.076
What are you doing?

21:33.200 --> 21:34.406
Hiding my contraband.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.247
They're doing a bag check, obviously.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.125
What for?

21:43.210 --> 21:44.541
I don't know.

21:44.630 --> 21:47.258
Drugs. Guns. Kiddy porn.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.889
Okay, Vice Principal Childs
needs to check everyone's backpacks.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.767
Stay seated, hands on your desks.

21:52.850 --> 21:55.478
Study the quotation,
think about what it might mean.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.472
Relax, I don't think you have
what they're looking for.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.358
This is a complete violation
of our civil rights.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.139
Do you have a warrant?

22:07.240 --> 22:10.368
We don't need a warrant
on school property. It's for safety.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.868
They're tarot cards.
Want me to read your fortune?

22:17.210 --> 22:18.609
[Childs] Okay, Mr. Jensen.

22:19.290 --> 22:21.417
You want to protest your civil rights?

22:32.640 --> 22:33.675
Here it is.

22:38.230 --> 22:39.470
That's not mine.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.300
I need you to come to the office with me.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.515
We can talk there.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.315
But that's not mine.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.236
[Hannah]
If I ’0’ known what would happen. . .

22:53.330 --> 22:54.979
what that night had in store. ..

22:57.660 --> 23:00.037
I might never have
walked through that door.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.241
But parties have a weird magic.

23:07.300 --> 23:09.461
They’re l/ke an alternate universe.

23:11.260 --> 23:12.466
[indistinct chatter]

23:16.220 --> 23:19.269
They can make you believe
that maybe anything is poss/b/e.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.811
Hannah Baker! There she is!

23:27.030 --> 23:29.772
[all] Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

23:32.280 --> 23:33.907
I like the hair. Looking good.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.360
Thank you.

23:35.660 --> 23:37.480
Keg's out back. Get on it.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.036
Here you go.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.202
Maybe you do fit in after all.

23:42.580 --> 23:43.820
Oh, shit.

23:44.130 --> 23:45.199
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

23:45.290 --> 23:48.259
Well, well, well,
look who decided to show up.

23:49.550 --> 23:52.678
Fashionably late doesn't fly
when it's your girlfriend's party.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.967
[chuckles] Maybe I can make it up to you.

23:55.890 --> 23:58.176
Maybe, if you're lucky.

23:58.850 --> 24:02.729
I had to stop somewhere on my way over
because I realized what today was.

24:03.190 --> 24:04.225
Um...

24:04.690 --> 24:05.896
Saturday?

24:06.610 --> 24:10.068
The day my parents went to DC.
for some Air Force ceremony?

24:10.990 --> 24:14.778
The day of the first fucking party
of junior year!

24:14.870 --> 24:16.360
[cheering]

24:16.700 --> 24:20.409
No, it's officially two months
since we've been going out.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.821
Oh, my God, you are such a girl!

24:23.750 --> 24:25.786
-Shall we commemorate the occasion?
- es.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.871
[phone camera clicking]

24:28.710 --> 24:29.790
Nice.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.120
You need a refill?

24:31.220 --> 24:32.460
Uh, no, I'm good.

24:32.550 --> 24:35.041
But knock yourself out.
Bryce picked up a ton of stuff.

24:39.220 --> 24:40.676
-Hey.
-Hey.

24:41.390 --> 24:43.972
So, you and Justin?

24:44.400 --> 24:45.799
Yeah, me and Justin. Why?

24:46.810 --> 24:48.266
I mean, exactly. Why?

24:48.360 --> 24:49.770
And, like, how?

24:50.400 --> 24:51.640
Summer school.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.480
Do I need your permission?

24:54.610 --> 24:56.612
Do you remember what he did to me?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.076
You guys weren't even technically dating.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.650
How is that even the point?

25:01.040 --> 25:02.860
Bryce is the one who sent the photo.

25:03.410 --> 25:05.366
But Justin is the one who showed him.

25:07.710 --> 25:08.779
I'm sorry. Look...

25:10.420 --> 25:14.424
Ancient history aside, just...
be careful, okay?

25:15.090 --> 25:18.503
You're so sweet, Hannah, but I'm fine.
I know what I'm doing.

25:19.890 --> 25:22.597
[Hannah]
But she didn ’t.. . did she, Justin?

25:23.480 --> 25:24.435
She didn ’t know.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.478
Ugh! I hate hard liquor.
Are you trying to corrupt me?

25:27.560 --> 25:29.721
[Justin] No, we're celebrating, remember?

25:29.820 --> 25:31.970
And people don ’t really change.

25:32.070 --> 25:33.139
[Jessica] Oh, shit.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.275
[laughing]

25:35.860 --> 25:39.318
Welcome to your second tape, Justin Foley.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.998
[Childs] It's an automatic
five-day suspension, Clay.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.456
Sit down, please.

25:45.540 --> 25:47.110
I already told you, it's not mine.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.166
Somebody must've slipped it in my bag.

25:49.290 --> 25:51.338
Do you have any idea who?

25:51.420 --> 25:54.207
Who told you to check my bag?
Start with them.

25:54.300 --> 25:57.428
Your classmates are concerned about you,
and so are we.

25:57.510 --> 26:00.388
-Concerned about me?
-It's been a rough couple of weeks.

26:00.470 --> 26:03.769
But after what happened yesterday
with the exchange students, now this...

26:03.850 --> 26:04.919
It's not mine!

26:05.390 --> 26:06.379
[phone rings]

26:08.520 --> 26:10.181
Principal Bolan, hello.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.890
I understand. Of course. Got it.

26:16.990 --> 26:17.979
Thank you.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.612
Principal Bolan feels,
given your spotless record

26:23.700 --> 26:25.406
and your role in the school community,

26:25.500 --> 26:27.286
that a three-day suspension will suffice,

26:27.620 --> 26:30.623
as long as you sign up for the drug
deferral program at the police station.

26:30.710 --> 26:33.588
I don't believe this.
You have no idea why this is happening.

26:33.710 --> 26:35.666
Okay, tell me.
Why is this happening?

26:35.760 --> 26:37.625
Who told you to check my bag?

26:39.550 --> 26:41.677
Do you have something
you want to tell us?

26:43.890 --> 26:45.676
Like who sold you the drugs?

26:46.640 --> 26:48.801
Forget it.
You already think I'm lying.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.601
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

26:51.690 --> 26:53.601
About everything, all right?

26:53.690 --> 26:54.930
Can I go now?

26:56.110 --> 26:57.145
Please.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.106
You can have a seat over there.

27:00.740 --> 27:02.696
Your mom will pick you up shortly.

27:04.790 --> 27:08.658
[Slqe] Mr. Ramos asked me to get
more dry erasers for the white board.

27:17.550 --> 27:18.585
They suspend you?

27:19.470 --> 27:20.334
Three days.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.217
I told you they were doing a bag check.
Why didn't you hide it?

27:23.300 --> 27:24.597
[scoffs]

27:26.430 --> 27:27.340
[sighs]

27:28.140 --> 27:28.970
Aanay.

27:30.230 --> 27:32.391
Didn't realize you were
such a stoner, Clay.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.061
I didn't realize you cared.

27:35.150 --> 27:36.560
Excuse me.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.395
Of course I don't.

27:42.610 --> 27:44.111
Did you tell Zach I keyed his car?

27:46.080 --> 27:46.944
Seriously?

27:48.910 --> 27:52.118
You think I'm the type that would
rat anyone out about anything?

27:53.130 --> 27:55.246
I don't know what kind of person
anyone is anymore.

27:57.340 --> 27:58.204
Yeah?

27:58.630 --> 28:00.416
What kind of person are you?

28:01.630 --> 28:03.382
[C/BJ/J
Are you more of a beer person

28:03.470 --> 28:05.006
or a beer person?

28:05.930 --> 28:08.717
Hmm... Tough call. Uh...

28:09.850 --> 28:10.726
I'll take beer.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.300
Excellent choice, madam.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.108
Tonight, it is being served lukewarm

28:15.190 --> 28:17.897
in questionably clean cups
and devoid of any flavor.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.186
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Delicious.

28:22.490 --> 28:25.982
When I was saving your seat for you,
I had to fight off not one

28:26.070 --> 28:29.654
but three drunk teenagers
playing Suck and Blow.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.205
Good work.

28:32.290 --> 28:35.782
I hope you called their parents
and notified the proper authorities.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.199
Oh, definitely.

28:37.670 --> 28:39.410
No fun on my watch.

28:39.670 --> 28:42.082
Fun? At a party?

28:42.720 --> 28:45.587
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Oh, my God.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.795
Oh, my God.

28:48.510 --> 28:50.967
Uh, you look really nice tonight,
by the way.

28:52.310 --> 28:54.016
Oh. This?

28:54.690 --> 28:56.760
I just threw something on.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.811
Well, you do, you look really good.

28:59.900 --> 29:02.949
Wait, wait, wait, _I want to play!
[giggling]

29:03.070 --> 29:03.946
Scoot over, Clay.

29:04.030 --> 29:06.100
I don't think there's any... room. Whoa.

29:08.780 --> 29:09.940
Are you guys playing?

29:10.120 --> 29:11.155
Uh, no.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.655
So you guys just like to watch?

29:14.620 --> 29:17.623
Yeah, only from an anthropological
point of view. You know.

29:17.710 --> 29:20.622
Observing the millennial teenager
in its natural habitat.

29:20.710 --> 29:22.291
Hey! You guys playing or what?

29:22.380 --> 29:23.460
[both] Yes!

29:28.390 --> 29:31.769
-[kids cheering, hooting]
-Damn, Justin, get in there!

29:32.350 --> 29:34.227
Okay. Personal space!

29:34.350 --> 29:36.341
-Love that personal space.
-Yeah.

29:37.060 --> 29:39.016
Shit, I guess I lost!

29:39.150 --> 29:40.686
Yeah, you fucking lost.

29:40.770 --> 29:43.603
-Yeah. You good? Sorry.
-No, I'm fine. Are you okay?

29:43.690 --> 29:44.941
-[C|ay] Oh, great.
-[laughing]

29:46.570 --> 29:50.028
[Hannah]
That n/ght;
for the ﬁrst time in a long time...

29:51.910 --> 29:53.696
I didn ’t feel in vis/b/e.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.781
[overlapping chatter]

29:56.580 --> 29:58.707
I mean, they get along fine. It's just...

30:01.210 --> 30:04.088
I don't know.
It seems like they're bored or something.

30:04.170 --> 30:07.253
LIke the only thing they even have
in common anymore is me.

30:08.050 --> 30:11.099
Parents always think
we don't pick up on that stuff. Like...

30:11.930 --> 30:13.921
Not only do they not see me,

30:14.020 --> 30:15.885
they don't see me seeing them.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.515
I'm never getting old.

30:20.610 --> 30:21.645
Yeah, me neither.

30:26.700 --> 30:31.023
I was nervous, ’cause I felt so good
and I didn ’t want to screw it up.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.150
I was trying to act normal.

30:36.870 --> 30:38.497
But I o’r'dn ’t really know how anymore.

30:43.670 --> 30:45.206
Okay. [dry chuckle]

30:45.300 --> 30:47.370
Yeah, this is getting ridiculous.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.461
Come on, I could use a refill.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.422
I think we could both use
something a bit stronger?

30:52.510 --> 30:53.386
Sure. Absolutely.

30:59.310 --> 31:00.390
[Clay] Okay. All set.

31:03.150 --> 31:05.937
[Hannah]
There are three stories
to tell about that n/ght.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.276
I 7/ tell this one first

31:16.700 --> 31:18.531
How did I end up in that bedroom?

31:19.870 --> 31:21.280
Thatis another story.

31:23.170 --> 31:25.126
But for now, Justin,

31:25.210 --> 31:27.508
you’d been with the same girl all n/ght.

31:27.590 --> 31:28.579
[laughing]

31:29.970 --> 31:31.881
But I ’m not gonna call her out by name.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.882
Even though, if you were at that party,
you already know.

31:36.390 --> 31:37.550
[Justin] You're so hot.

31:38.310 --> 31:39.880
I can't keep my eyes off of you!

31:39.980 --> 31:41.516
[Jessica] Or your hands.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.646
[laughs]

31:43.610 --> 31:46.067
I realized two things in that moment.

31:47.110 --> 31:49.066
Number one, I was drunk.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.810
[Jessica] Hang on. Please.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.448
And number two, so was this girl.

31:57.490 --> 31:58.536
Are you okay?

31:58.620 --> 31:59.655
Yeah, Ijust...

31:59.750 --> 32:00.705
You need some water?

32:00.790 --> 32:03.953
But I ﬁgured you ’0' just give up
and leave her alone.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.338
I just need to close my eyes for a second.

32:07.340 --> 32:08.625
[Justin chuckles]

32:08.710 --> 32:11.087
At least; I hoped you would.

32:11.170 --> 32:15.004
Well, come on, you don't want
to mess around for a little while?

32:16.180 --> 32:17.966
I know what you ’re th/nk/ng.

32:18.060 --> 32:21.348
Maybe if this girl
hadn ’t had so much to drink,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.476
what happened next
never would have happened.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.010
But it was a party.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.601
Everyone had too much to drink.

32:28.690 --> 32:31.443
And besides, how can you blame someone

32:31.530 --> 32:34.021
for something that happens
wh/le they’re unconscious?

32:42.580 --> 32:46.289
Mom? Look, I know you're mad right now
and you have every right.

32:46.380 --> 32:49.247
Honestly, Clay, I'm not mad at you.
I'm at a loss.

32:49.340 --> 32:53.219
Look, Mom, will you take me
to the police station before we go home,

32:53.300 --> 32:55.882
to sign up for that program?

32:55.970 --> 32:57.210
You have a week to sign up.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.301
I know, I...

32:58.560 --> 33:00.209
but I need to get it out of the way.

33:01.430 --> 33:02.306
Please?

33:04.140 --> 33:05.437
[sighs]

33:05.520 --> 33:06.396
Get in.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.810
[engine starts]

33:11.490 --> 33:12.980
Thanks. See you later.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.901
-[boy] I can give you a ride.
-[gir|] Okay. Sure.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.025
Marijuana.

33:16.780 --> 33:17.860
Seriously?

33:17.950 --> 33:20.157
-Are you out of your mind?
-Okay, chill out.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.824
We had to send Clay a message.
He was threatening to go to the school.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.610
-Shit.
-Yeah.

33:25.710 --> 33:26.779
So, me and Justin and Zach,

33:26.880 --> 33:29.531
we figure we gotta show him
who's really in control around here.

33:29.630 --> 33:31.040
He's already acting up.

33:31.130 --> 33:33.507
How do you know this won't
just piss him off more?

33:33.590 --> 33:36.832
At least we bought ourselves time,
kept him from talking.

33:37.340 --> 33:38.716
[Lain/e]
I ’/l wait r/ght o ver here.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.104
Mom...

33:56.490 --> 33:57.525
Um...

34:00.530 --> 34:02.578
Can I ask you a legal question?

34:03.790 --> 34:04.996
Like, uh...

34:05.870 --> 34:06.916
Like a hypothetical?

34:08.120 --> 34:11.169
You want to ask me
a legal question now? Really?

34:14.260 --> 34:15.124
Ijust...

34:18.180 --> 34:19.545
If someone hurt someone...

34:20.260 --> 34:23.172
but the victim won't come forward...

34:23.850 --> 34:25.306
Clay, who's hurting you?

34:25.850 --> 34:28.011
No, it's not me.
It's a hypothetical. Just...

34:29.230 --> 34:31.107
-It's a hypothetical.
-All right.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.935
Hurting them how?

34:34.820 --> 34:36.105
Let's say, uh...

34:36.780 --> 34:37.644
an assault.

34:38.490 --> 34:41.232
But there's no actual evidence,
'cause it happened a while ago.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.026
This why you keyed the car?

34:43.120 --> 34:45.190
No, Mom. Just listen, okay?

34:45.290 --> 34:47.747
Just listen. All right?

34:50.330 --> 34:53.914
Let's just say that the one person
who actually witnessed it...

34:55.010 --> 34:56.716
isn't around anymore.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.007
Like, if they moved away or something.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.598
Could the person who did it
still be prosecuted?

35:05.270 --> 35:08.057
To be honest, that sounds
like a tough case to prosecute.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.148
If the victim won't talk,

35:11.230 --> 35:13.107
the witness won't talk,

35:13.190 --> 35:14.646
there's no evidence to prove it...

35:15.190 --> 35:17.852
There's basically no way to press charges.

35:21.700 --> 35:22.519
Fuck.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.692
Okay, you need to tell me
what is going on right now.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.360
Just forget it, Mom, it's...

35:29.370 --> 35:31.281
It's pointless anyway. We can go.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.120
What about the police?

35:38.800 --> 35:43.339
Well, I am sorry. You do not get
to answer me with a shrug anymore.

35:43.430 --> 35:45.500
You do not get to shut me out.
You are my son.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.635
Do you hear me?

35:48.310 --> 35:51.689
Wait, wait, Mom, hey.
Hey, Mom, what are you doing?

35:51.770 --> 35:52.976
I need to find out what happened.

35:53.060 --> 35:55.972
If I can't get you to talk,
then I am going to find someone who can.

35:56.070 --> 35:58.812
I'm trying to help you,
but you are pissing me off.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.098
Okay.

36:05.490 --> 36:06.366
Okay.

36:15.670 --> 36:16.796
I lied.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.337
Um, I did know Hannah Baker.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.057
We worked together all the time
at the Crestmont.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.891
We had classes together.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.350
Uh...

36:43.490 --> 36:44.730
She was my friend.

36:48.910 --> 36:49.945
And I miss her...

36:53.580 --> 36:54.820
really fucking bad.

36:56.210 --> 36:57.086
Oh, honey.

36:59.630 --> 37:02.758
I didn't know how empty it would feel.

37:06.220 --> 37:08.677
There's this big part
of the world that's just...

37:09.760 --> 37:12.558
just gone, and everyone else
just keeps moving forward.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.391
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

37:15.480 --> 37:16.970
The worst part is, there's...

37:18.570 --> 37:20.106
there's nothing I can do.

37:22.780 --> 37:24.600
I can't save her, I can't...

37:26.410 --> 37:27.900
I can't bring her back. I'm...

37:33.460 --> 37:35.530
I'm completely fucking useless.

37:36.460 --> 37:39.418
No, you're not useless.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.990
You don't know, you don't know.

37:41.090 --> 37:44.833
I know that you're a good person...

37:45.840 --> 37:46.886
with a big heart.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.598
I know Hannah was very luclq
to have you as a friend.

37:51.680 --> 37:52.886
She wasn't, though.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.225
She wasn't.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.517
Clay, your question about the assault...

38:00.360 --> 38:01.975
that have to do with Hannah?

38:03.280 --> 38:04.144
No.

38:06.780 --> 38:07.849
Not really.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.112
Even if a crime can't be prosecuted,

38:12.200 --> 38:13.747
it shouldn't stay a secret.

38:19.170 --> 38:20.410
-Shh. ..
-Stop!

38:29.840 --> 38:32.752
Mom, I'm sorry, but I've got to go.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.556
What? Clay, no.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.188
I'm sorry, okay? I've got to go.

38:37.270 --> 38:39.431
-I will be home later, I promise.
-C|ay!

38:59.580 --> 39:00.626
[Justin] Are you okay?

39:01.840 --> 39:02.989
You need some water?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.706
No, Ijust...

39:06.880 --> 39:09.257
I just need to close my eyes for a second.

39:10.930 --> 39:14.002
You don't want to mess
around a little bit?

39:14.760 --> 39:15.636
No.

39:55.100 --> 39:58.422
[Bryce] There you are.
We're doing beer pong out back.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.056
Come on, dude.

40:00.140 --> 40:01.846
-[Justin] I'm fine.
-[Bryce] What?

40:01.940 --> 40:03.055
[Justin] I'm good.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.390
[Bryce] You got someone in here?

40:04.480 --> 40:07.108
-[Justin] I'm sticking around for Jessica.
-[Bryce] Oh.

40:07.570 --> 40:08.935
What happened? She's in there now?

40:09.030 --> 40:10.179
[Justin] I don't know. Just...

40:10.280 --> 40:11.269
[bang]

40:12.910 --> 40:14.025
[body thuds outside]

40:14.120 --> 40:15.109
[door opens]

40:15.660 --> 40:16.570
[door closes]

40:24.420 --> 40:26.035
[Hannah]
I had to do something.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.661
I had to make him stop.

40:29.050 --> 40:29.869
[door opens]

40:29.960 --> 40:31.541
The fuck out of here, man!

40:32.220 --> 40:33.460
[thudding]

40:33.550 --> 40:34.960
[door slams, locks]

40:35.260 --> 40:37.501
But I cou/dn ’t get my feet to move.

40:39.890 --> 40:41.130
It was dark in there.

40:43.230 --> 40:46.108
And the music was loud
but I saw his face.

40:47.690 --> 40:50.898
And I recognized his voice
as clear as day.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.349
And so would all of you.

41:14.630 --> 41:16.712
But this tape isn ’t about him.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.303
It’s about you and me, Justin.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.425
You called him a friend.

41:21.850 --> 41:24.683
-[door slams]
-But your girlfriend needed you.

41:33.110 --> 41:34.270
[retching]

41:35.950 --> 41:37.156
[crying]

42:04.640 --> 42:05.880
I'm sorry.

42:10.980 --> 42:13.187
That girl had two chances that night.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.650
But we both let her down.

42:21.830 --> 42:23.650
[music, chatter downstairs]

42:24.200 --> 42:25.531
How do I live with that?

42:29.880 --> 42:31.450
How do you, Justin?

42:33.500 --> 42:35.832
How does she live with what happened?

42:42.720 --> 42:46.178
Uh-uh. Elijah, you know the rules.
Gotta wait for Daddy.

42:46.270 --> 42:48.261
[man] That's not my concern, Sergeant.

42:48.350 --> 42:50.682
I want it on my desk first thing tomorrow.

42:50.770 --> 42:53.352
I wouldn't let your father see you
doing that at the table.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.930
Hmm! Mmm!

42:55.230 --> 42:56.686
Something smells good.

42:56.820 --> 42:58.526
I don't know how you do it, Noelle.

42:58.610 --> 43:02.444
Well, I put a bunch of stuff
in a crock-pot and I forget about it.

43:02.620 --> 43:04.406
That's my secret.

43:04.490 --> 43:05.320
[laughs]

43:06.120 --> 43:08.827
Jessica. How was practice today?

43:08.920 --> 43:12.412
Great. Coach Loftin says I'm
one of the best on the team.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.660
She's giving me extra stunts to perform.

43:14.750 --> 43:16.297
Ah, she's testing you.

43:16.510 --> 43:17.750
Remember what I told you.

43:17.840 --> 43:22.004
It's not enough to earn it once.
You gotta keep earning it day by day.

43:22.510 --> 43:23.670
Yes, sir.

43:24.100 --> 43:25.055
Elijah.

43:25.850 --> 43:27.886
Did you get that grade
on your spelling test?

43:27.980 --> 43:29.095
Yes, sir.

43:29.640 --> 43:30.800
Let's say grace.

43:35.190 --> 43:36.225
[phone chimes]

43:44.410 --> 43:45.445
[knocking at door]

43:47.250 --> 43:48.319
[knocking continues]

43:50.410 --> 43:52.162
He can't be prosecuted, okay?

43:52.250 --> 43:54.627
-What are you doing here?
-I know it was Bryce. All right?

43:54.710 --> 43:57.167
-Jesus.
-She said he was your friend.

43:57.670 --> 43:58.659
All right, get in here.

44:01.010 --> 44:02.136
You have to tell her.

44:02.220 --> 44:04.347
-When the fuck will you give up?
-I get it.

44:04.430 --> 44:06.637
Trying to protect your friend,
you lied to Jessica

44:06.720 --> 44:08.847
-and told her Hannah made it up.
-I did?

44:09.270 --> 44:10.680
I guess it's my word against Hannah's.

44:10.770 --> 44:11.589
Exactly.

44:11.690 --> 44:14.011
The one witness is dead,
Bryce will get away with it

44:14.110 --> 44:16.351
and you can stop protecting him.
It's legal fact.

44:16.440 --> 44:19.568
Did you talk to somebody?
Tell me what the fuck you did.

44:19.650 --> 44:22.312
Are you listening?
I just told you, I can't go to the cops.

44:23.990 --> 44:25.150
What do you want from me?

44:25.280 --> 44:28.033
Tell Jessica the truth
about what happened to her that night.

44:29.370 --> 44:30.405
She knows what happened.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.616
-Go ask her.
-I did.

44:32.710 --> 44:34.701
She repeated whatever lies you fed her.

44:34.790 --> 44:37.031
But she knows something's up.
She's messed up.

44:37.130 --> 44:38.586
She was drunk at school today.

44:38.670 --> 44:40.126
-[oven dings]
-She's fine.

44:40.590 --> 44:41.830
She's fucked up.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.080
And so are you.

44:45.300 --> 44:46.676
Jessica deserves the truth,

44:46.760 --> 44:49.092
and she's never gonna believe it
unless it comes from you.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.010
[Bryce] There you are!

44:54.100 --> 44:56.648
[slurs] Hey, we're playing
beer pong out back.

44:56.730 --> 44:57.765
[laughs]

44:58.440 --> 45:00.522
-Hey, dude.
-You want to go?

45:00.610 --> 45:02.896
No, dude, I'm all right.

45:03.990 --> 45:05.946
I'm sticking around for Jessica.

45:06.030 --> 45:07.941
-She's so wasted!
-Oh, yeah?

45:09.490 --> 45:11.321
I'll bet you had some fun with her,
didn't you?

45:11.910 --> 45:13.070
Let me see.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.036
Dude.

45:16.420 --> 45:17.739
She's my girlfriend.

45:17.920 --> 45:20.798
Come on, she's, what,
she's your summer hook-up.

45:23.590 --> 45:25.672
What's mine is yours, right?

45:32.390 --> 45:34.688
Didn't happen the way Hannah said.

45:34.770 --> 45:36.055
I've heard that before.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.760
-Tel| Jessica the truth.
-I already told her.

45:39.860 --> 45:41.225
It's bullshit, and you know it.

45:43.070 --> 45:44.105
We hooked up.

45:44.860 --> 45:46.100
That's what happened.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.270
She wanted it, and we hooked up.

45:48.870 --> 45:50.326
There was no other guy.

45:50.410 --> 45:52.822
There is no other story, you hear me?

45:53.540 --> 45:57.169
So whatever Hannah thought she saw,
she lied about it on those tapes

45:57.250 --> 46:01.129
because she's a crazy drama queen
who killed herself for attention.

46:06.510 --> 46:08.330
I'm sorry, man,
I know she was your friend.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.249
And you were her first kiss.

46:11.350 --> 46:12.590
So she said.

46:18.850 --> 46:21.011
whatever Hannah thinks happened...

46:22.820 --> 46:24.185
how does that help Jess now?

46:24.740 --> 46:27.561
What she needs, what we all need...

46:28.490 --> 46:30.026
is for this to be done with.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.862
How can she be done with this
if she doesn't know what it is?

46:42.590 --> 46:45.161
Dude, come on.
Leave her alone, get off her.

46:45.260 --> 46:48.332
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Hey, hey! Dude, dude!

47:04.570 --> 47:05.810
You can get me suspended.

47:07.030 --> 47:09.100
You can ruin my fucking life
if you want to.

47:09.780 --> 47:10.940
It won't change what you did.

47:12.910 --> 47:15.367
And sooner or later,
people are going to find out.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.957
People are not gonna find out.

47:19.290 --> 47:21.281
Why are you protecting Bryce?

47:21.380 --> 47:22.449
What does he have on you?

47:22.540 --> 47:24.701
I'm not protecting Bryce,
you little fuck!

47:27.340 --> 47:29.171
God, I'm protecting Jessica!

47:30.840 --> 47:33.217
I care more about Jessica
than I do about Hannah,

47:33.300 --> 47:35.382
than I do about you,
than I do about anybody else.

47:37.060 --> 47:38.766
All right? So just get the fuck out!

47:44.320 --> 47:45.355
I want my bike.

47:47.860 --> 47:48.736
Your bike?

47:49.820 --> 47:50.639
Seriously?

47:50.740 --> 47:53.732
Yes, you fucking asshole,
I want my bike.

47:55.740 --> 47:57.446
It's out back, behind the building.

47:58.290 --> 47:59.826
Go knock yourself out.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.046
[door slams]

48:12.220 --> 48:13.426
[sizzling]

48:16.560 --> 48:17.595
[door opens]

48:19.930 --> 48:21.682
-Hey.
-[Lainie] Hey.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.851
Did you find him?

48:25.360 --> 48:28.602
I drove around for an hour
Since I called you.

48:28.690 --> 48:29.930
Nothing.

48:30.280 --> 48:31.941
Where could he be going?

48:32.150 --> 48:33.777
This point, who knows.

48:35.870 --> 48:37.189
And the weed?

48:37.280 --> 48:39.362
Maybe we've been looking
at the wrong warning signs.

48:39.450 --> 48:42.704
Maybe we don't have a suicidal kid,
we've got one with a drug problem.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.576
I really don't think so.

48:44.790 --> 48:46.997
I teach potheads.
I know what that looks like.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.239
It's not Clay.

48:48.670 --> 48:50.126
He's quite good at hiding things.

48:51.050 --> 48:52.540
He said he didn't know her.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.211
He said he didn't know her well.

48:54.300 --> 48:56.097
Clearly, he knew her very well.

48:56.680 --> 48:58.841
He is devastated.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.683
He feels like he's responsible somehow.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.145
[sighs]

49:09.530 --> 49:10.895
Was she his girlfriend?

49:13.110 --> 49:14.520
Did he do something to her?

49:15.160 --> 49:16.309
Jesus, Lainie...

49:16.910 --> 49:18.195
what are you implying?

49:20.080 --> 49:22.742
I am defending a lawsuit
brought by two parents

49:22.830 --> 49:25.162
whose daughter was so damaged by something

49:25.250 --> 49:27.286
that she took her own life.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.046
What if our son was part of that?

49:30.130 --> 49:31.666
He's not capable of it.

49:32.300 --> 49:33.506
How do you know?

49:34.050 --> 49:35.085
I know.

49:42.930 --> 49:44.056
I have to give up the case.

49:44.140 --> 49:45.721
I can't take it to trial.

49:46.690 --> 49:48.180
To protect Clay?

49:48.270 --> 49:49.316
Or you and me?

49:50.520 --> 49:52.021
To protect all of us.

49:53.030 --> 49:56.102
Quitting the case
wouldn't even do that, would it?

50:19.890 --> 50:21.255
[thunder rumbling]

50:23.390 --> 50:25.346
[thunder crashes]

50:48.460 --> 50:49.916
-Where's Justin?
-Shh, shh.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.833
Shh. Don't worry about him.
We're just having fun, okay?

50:53.420 --> 50:55.376
-What?
-Take it easy.

50:55.460 --> 50:56.290
[groans]

51:02.050 --> 51:03.381
What are you doing?

51:03.470 --> 51:04.846
[crying]

51:09.900 --> 51:10.764
Oh, my God!

51:13.520 --> 51:14.566
[tapping]

51:27.960 --> 51:28.779
Hey.

51:29.750 --> 51:30.614
Hey.

51:31.080 --> 51:31.956
Sorry I didn't...

51:32.750 --> 51:33.990
didn't text you back.

51:37.050 --> 51:38.085
Can I come in?

51:40.130 --> 51:41.006
Yeah.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.656
We should probably talk, huh?

52:10.790 --> 52:11.779
[sobs]

52:34.980 --> 52:36.857
[sawing]

52:41.950 --> 52:43.099
Hey, Tony.

52:47.950 --> 52:49.076
Tony!

52:51.540 --> 52:52.609
Yeah.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.911
Your dad said I could come find you.

52:57.040 --> 52:57.916
You okay?

52:58.000 --> 52:59.956
I just talked to Justin about Jessica.

53:00.630 --> 53:01.506
Okay.

53:03.430 --> 53:04.920
How did everyone...

53:05.010 --> 53:06.170
how did you...

53:06.260 --> 53:07.841
just listen to that,

53:07.930 --> 53:09.807
and, like, ignore it?

53:09.890 --> 53:11.926
I don't think anyone ignored it, Clay.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.642
Why is everyone protecting Bryce?

53:15.230 --> 53:16.640
Why are you?

53:16.810 --> 53:18.016
I'm doing it for Hannah.

53:18.110 --> 53:20.021
Fuck that, Tony! Fuck that!

53:20.110 --> 53:21.566
Jessica got raped!

53:22.690 --> 53:26.478
And Justin's got her brainwashed.
Everyone at school is covering it up.

53:26.570 --> 53:29.448
-That is beyond fucked up!
-You don't know the whole story yet.

53:29.540 --> 53:30.984
What else do I need to know?

53:31.080 --> 53:34.538
You're brainwashed like the rest,
but I'm not, okay?

53:34.620 --> 53:37.123
And I'm not gonna sit back and do nothing

53:37.210 --> 53:39.280
like you and everyone else,
including Hannah.

53:39.380 --> 53:40.836
You need to calm down.

53:40.960 --> 53:43.838
She let everyone intimidate her
over and over and over,

53:43.920 --> 53:45.797
until she just disappeared.

53:47.550 --> 53:49.802
Well, not me, no. I am not giving up.

53:49.890 --> 53:52.097
-You're upset.
-Fucking right! Why aren't you?

53:52.810 --> 53:54.129
Why isn't everybody?

53:55.310 --> 53:56.891
Just take a breath, okay?

53:57.650 --> 53:59.106
Fuck you, Tony.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.686
-Fuck you.
-What the fuck are you doing, Clay?

54:03.360 --> 54:04.236
Come on!

54:11.120 --> 54:12.030
Fuck you.

54:12.790 --> 54:14.075
Fuck all of you.

54:24.260 --> 54:25.124
Fuck.

54:25.800 --> 54:26.619
Goddamn it!

54:27.260 --> 54:28.329
God!

54:39.350 --> 54:40.556
[Clay breathes heavily]

55:10.390 --> 55:12.290
What happens if the tapes get out?

55:13.350 --> 55:16.979
Let's say we try and get
some justice for Jessica.

55:17.060 --> 55:17.936
VVhatthen?

55:18.640 --> 55:20.392
It's his word against a dead girl's.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.358
Open season on Hannah Baker
all over again.

55:23.820 --> 55:26.232
What if we got one person
to tell the truth?

55:27.690 --> 55:30.488
-I mean, just one of them.
-All right, okay, I'll make you a deal.

55:30.660 --> 55:32.651
Listen to the tapes, all of them.

55:33.490 --> 55:34.536
And then we'll talk.

55:35.290 --> 55:36.996
We'll do whatever we have to do.

55:37.790 --> 55:38.825
And you'll help me?

55:40.710 --> 55:41.574
Always.

56:02.270 --> 56:03.726
["My Life In Rewind" playing]

56:13.990 --> 56:20.281
A thousand regrets rush right by

56:21.710 --> 56:26.795
