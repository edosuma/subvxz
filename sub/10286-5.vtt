WEBVTT

00:08.351 --> 00:09.909
You find something good in there?

00:10.220 --> 00:11.448
Peanuts.

00:11.621 --> 00:14.681
Oh, yeah. What are those little guys
up to now?

00:14.858 --> 00:18.123
Two-eighty a ton on the April market.

00:20.596 --> 00:22.461
Thanks.

00:23.599 --> 00:25.362
Do I look intimidating?

00:26.569 --> 00:30.767
Oh, in a Cro-Magnon sort of way,
I suppose.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.134
The Manhattan chapter
of Volunteer Fathers thinks so.

00:34.310 --> 00:36.175
They turned down my application.

00:36.345 --> 00:37.869
You're kidding. Why?

00:38.047 --> 00:41.949
My size. They felt that and my appearance
might present an inhibiting factor...

00:42.118 --> 00:44.881
...in the development of a healthy
adult-child relationship.

00:45.053 --> 00:46.782
What's that supposed to mean?

00:46.955 --> 00:48.445
That I'd scare the kids.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.889
- Goodbye.
- Oh, come on, Bull.

00:53.061 --> 00:54.961
You're being too sensitive.

00:55.130 --> 00:58.998
It's not just you. I'm sure every one of us
is influenced by the way we look.

00:59.167 --> 01:02.136
- Right.
- Yeah. And so we all get self-conscious.

01:02.303 --> 01:04.498
Do people do this to you?

01:07.542 --> 01:09.702
Not that often.

01:11.078 --> 01:12.909
After you, big fella.

01:13.080 --> 01:17.244
I wish people would stop
getting out of my way.

01:17.985 --> 01:19.850
- What's with him?
- He's depressed.

01:20.020 --> 01:21.612
How can you tell?

01:22.723 --> 01:25.658
He told us. It seems that he offered
to be a volunteer father...

01:25.826 --> 01:27.157
...and they turned him down.

01:27.327 --> 01:31.286
Obvious discrimination based on
nothing more than the way he looks.

01:31.465 --> 01:33.625
Yeah. Reminds me of a guy I saw once...

01:33.800 --> 01:35.859
...in a carnival sideshow.
- Please don't.

01:36.035 --> 01:38.128
Malcolm the Human Oddity,
they called him.

01:38.304 --> 01:42.502
- I'm begging you.
- He had two complete faces on one head.

01:42.675 --> 01:44.267
Oh, Harry.

01:44.443 --> 01:48.038
Sorry. I didn't mean to gross you out.
I'm sure the other face was a trick.

01:48.214 --> 01:50.580
It was rubber or putty or something.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.082
<i>It wasn't. He talked.</i>

01:55.887 --> 01:58.048
Excuse me.
Where's the nearest exit?

01:58.223 --> 02:00.487
- You're looking at it.
- No, I'm not.

02:01.726 --> 02:02.954
I think he's blind.

02:03.128 --> 02:05.119
That's right, kid,
but I'm not deaf.

02:05.297 --> 02:07.162
Sorry. I didn't know you
could hear that.

02:07.332 --> 02:08.628
You know, it must be true...

02:08.800 --> 02:12.258
...that when one sense is lost,
the others become stronger to compensate.

02:12.437 --> 02:14.530
Of course that's true.
For example...

02:14.706 --> 02:17.266
...I can tell that there are four people
at this table.

02:17.442 --> 02:20.604
One is having a cup of coffee,
two are having a muffin...

02:20.778 --> 02:22.507
...and one is...

02:22.680 --> 02:24.443
...cremating a cat.

02:26.550 --> 02:28.017
- Hey, grab that guy!
- Gotta run.

02:28.185 --> 02:29.812
Hold it right there, Mr. Foley!

02:29.987 --> 02:32.217
Is that you, officer?
Thank God I found you.

02:32.389 --> 02:35.790
Yeah, yeah. Come on. Sorry, Judge Stone.
He keeps trying to escape.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.188
Judge?

02:37.361 --> 02:39.989
- One of this bunch is a judge?
- Yeah. I am.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.159
Get out of here.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.026
- No, he really is.
- Okay, let's go.

02:45.201 --> 02:47.032
All right, so big deal.
So you found me.

02:47.203 --> 02:50.172
You can see.
Where's the sport in that?

02:51.107 --> 02:53.302
I don't know about you,
but I feel lucky...

02:53.476 --> 02:55.273
...when I see the handicapped.
- Right.

02:55.445 --> 02:56.810
I admire them too.

02:56.980 --> 02:58.971
They've got spirit, courage.

02:59.148 --> 03:02.049
And all those great parking places.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.200 --> 03:55.064
Don't move.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.371
Okay, fine.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.902
I hate flies.

04:05.845 --> 04:08.643
I bet they're not crazy about you, either.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.077
Who is?

04:10.250 --> 04:15.017
Come on. If a fool at the Volunteer Fathers
of America says they don't want you...

04:15.188 --> 04:16.654
...that's their loss.

04:16.822 --> 04:20.519
It's not just them. People've been making
a big deal out of my size all my life.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.127
That's why folks started
calling you Bull, huh?

04:23.295 --> 04:25.229
No, that's a family name.

04:27.132 --> 04:29.396
Say, Bull, this is just a thought.

04:29.568 --> 04:31.502
Have you ever tried smiling?

04:31.971 --> 04:33.302
Yeah.

04:33.472 --> 04:35.599
I didn't care for it.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.440
I meant on a regular basis.

04:37.609 --> 04:40.203
Maybe it isn't just your size
that intimidates people.

04:40.379 --> 04:42.608
Maybe it's your... Your...

04:42.780 --> 04:44.771
...body language, you know?

04:44.949 --> 04:49.010
If you smile at someone,
they're apt to smile right back at you.

04:49.187 --> 04:51.951
Sounds stupid.

04:52.757 --> 04:55.225
Well, you get no argument from me.

04:57.295 --> 04:59.058
Harry.

04:59.430 --> 05:01.625
- I'm really worried about Bull.
- Oh, forget it.

05:01.799 --> 05:06.201
Once he stops giving off those menacing
vibes, people will warm up to him.

05:10.273 --> 05:12.764
Of course, these things take time.

05:12.943 --> 05:14.604
What happened?

05:14.778 --> 05:17.372
He bared his teeth at me.

05:18.582 --> 05:20.413
It was a smile.

05:21.518 --> 05:22.985
Get me out of here, Vince.

05:23.153 --> 05:25.246
I shouldn't have to be subjected to this.

05:25.422 --> 05:28.585
I know, baby. You're an artist.
I love you. Shut up.

05:32.395 --> 05:35.057
Hi there. I'm Harry Stone,
and you are?

05:35.231 --> 05:37.927
Vincent Frago and Iris Keller,
second-degree obscenity.

05:38.100 --> 05:42.434
Your Honor, these two were apprehended
making a porno flick in Central Park.

05:42.605 --> 05:46.200
Hold on, there, counselor.
The report clearly states that both parties...

05:46.375 --> 05:48.400
...were clothed at the time of arrest.
- Yes.

05:48.577 --> 05:51.410
But before that, they were naked
as jaybirds.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.740
Oh, did I mention I have a witness?

05:54.916 --> 05:58.079
Leonard Bloom, Your Honor.
I saw the whole thing.

05:58.253 --> 06:01.518
Unclothed bodies, writhing around
in the grass...

06:01.689 --> 06:06.626
...contorted dances of lust,
screams of sexual delight.

06:06.795 --> 06:08.524
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

06:08.696 --> 06:10.891
But damn well put, sir.

06:12.167 --> 06:14.863
So, Mr. Frago, it says here that
you are the producer.

06:15.036 --> 06:16.401
Producer, director, writer.

06:16.571 --> 06:19.004
I wear all the creative hats.

06:19.306 --> 06:21.331
And Miss Keller is your?

06:21.608 --> 06:23.405
Star.

06:24.111 --> 06:26.238
Along with 12 unidentified male...

06:26.413 --> 06:28.313
...costars.

06:29.149 --> 06:32.676
I know what you're thinking, Your Honor,
but I'm really a very good actress.

06:32.853 --> 06:34.718
I bet you'd have to be.

06:35.889 --> 06:37.220
You ever see me in anything?

06:37.391 --> 06:38.824
I don't think so.

06:38.992 --> 06:41.357
<i>- Eazy Rider?
- With Peter Fonda?</i>

06:42.128 --> 06:45.393
No. We spelled "easy" with a Z.

06:46.232 --> 06:48.757
But when my agent called me
about this job...

06:48.935 --> 06:52.393
...he said it was a chance
to do pap in the park.

06:52.572 --> 06:54.335
Who knew?

06:57.110 --> 06:58.805
Who, indeed?

07:00.113 --> 07:02.741
Your Honor, I left the background reports
in your office.

07:02.915 --> 07:06.008
Well, go ahead.
Miss Keller and I are discussing...

07:06.184 --> 07:07.776
...the cinema.

07:21.967 --> 07:23.298
Bull.

07:24.035 --> 07:27.937
Once, when I was a kid,
I got mad and broke my baseball bat.

07:28.773 --> 07:31.070
I got mad once and broke my doll.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.005
Over your head?

07:34.111 --> 07:35.408
Oh, Bull...

07:35.579 --> 07:38.912
...I know how much being
a volunteer father meant to you.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.143
It would've fulfilled my need
to help others, to become involved...

07:42.319 --> 07:45.345
...to have a positive effect
on the world around me.

07:45.523 --> 07:47.252
No big deal.

07:48.225 --> 07:50.693
Well, there are other organizations
you could join.

07:50.861 --> 07:54.762
Yeah, I tried. The only ones that didn't care
the way I looked were the Marines.

07:55.932 --> 07:58.628
They just saw me as another shaved head.

07:59.469 --> 08:01.562
Bet it's a snap to dry.

08:01.838 --> 08:03.863
I have to use a chamois.

08:06.809 --> 08:09.937
Your Honor, I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't point out that...

08:10.113 --> 08:14.049
...the pornography case against my clients
is basically circumstantial.

08:14.217 --> 08:16.946
That's true. It's pretty much
your word against theirs.

08:17.719 --> 08:20.244
I've got videotape.

08:20.522 --> 08:22.888
Pictures of these perverts!

08:23.058 --> 08:25.083
Alleged perverts, Mr. Bloom.

08:25.527 --> 08:28.087
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

08:28.263 --> 08:30.094
Why are you pampering these people?

08:30.265 --> 08:32.426
The man is a sick dog. Put him away.

08:32.601 --> 08:33.863
Take a seat, Mr. Bloom.

08:34.035 --> 08:37.164
At least I'm not some bluenose hypocrite
who talks real righteous...

08:37.339 --> 08:39.602
...but gets his mail in plain brown wrappers.

08:39.775 --> 08:42.333
Listen, you, I don't have to take
your kind of filth.

08:42.510 --> 08:44.671
- That cuts it.
- What's the matter, fish-face?

08:44.845 --> 08:47.837
- The truth hurt?
- Not as much as my fist!

08:49.317 --> 08:51.376
Nice catch.

08:55.957 --> 08:57.754
You want him removed
from the courtroom?

08:57.925 --> 09:00.086
That won't be necessary.
Will it, Mr. Bloom?

09:00.661 --> 09:04.187
I just want the same number of fingers
I came in with.

09:07.234 --> 09:09.429
Thanks a lot, Bull.
I'm glad you were there.

09:09.603 --> 09:12.037
Yeah. Right.

09:14.407 --> 09:16.898
Great job, Bull.
Well, did you see what you just did?

09:17.077 --> 09:19.307
You were able to be helpful right here.

09:19.479 --> 09:20.810
Excuse me.

09:20.981 --> 09:23.711
No kidding, Bull.
You're a tower of strength.

09:24.217 --> 09:28.516
- I'm a wall of flesh.
- "Wall of flesh." Hey, I like that.

09:29.221 --> 09:31.587
He's got that animal quality
I'm looking for.

09:31.757 --> 09:34.920
I am not an animal!

09:35.561 --> 09:38.689
I am a human being!

09:39.298 --> 09:43.598
What power! You can take that wimp
Pacino. Give me a big man anytime.

09:43.769 --> 09:45.566
- Bull, why don't you...?
- Leave me alone!

09:45.738 --> 09:49.003
Why don't you all just leave me alone?!

09:56.447 --> 09:58.108
Selma, go see if he's all right.

09:58.283 --> 10:02.743
I'll go, but I'm telling you right now,
he's not all right.

10:03.288 --> 10:04.880
Hey, can we hurry this thing up?

10:05.056 --> 10:08.822
Sure. The only way to decide this
is to view the videotape...

10:12.196 --> 10:15.256
...which I will do in the privacy
of my chambers.

10:17.567 --> 10:19.558
However, I would like both counsel present.

10:19.736 --> 10:22.671
You're a good man, Harry Stone.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.301
Court stands in recess.

10:30.147 --> 10:31.978
I have never seen Bull like that.

10:32.149 --> 10:35.380
Yes. They can be dangerous
when they're wounded.

10:35.919 --> 10:37.716
Oh, come on, I'm kidding.

10:37.888 --> 10:41.983
But if you can't laugh at other people,
who can you laugh at?

10:42.858 --> 10:45.326
Listen, don't trouble yourself about Bull.

10:45.494 --> 10:46.722
- He's okay?
- He's gone.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.796
- What do you mean, he's gone?
- Just that.

10:48.964 --> 10:50.659
He asked me to give you these.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.767
- He's quit.
- You're kidding.

10:52.935 --> 10:58.066
- Oh, honey, I don't have the strength to kid.
- Did he say where he was going?

10:58.240 --> 11:03.199
No. He just muttered something about being
fed up with the human race and took off.

11:20.695 --> 11:21.923
Hello.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.031
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

11:25.567 --> 11:27.591
Foley.

11:33.741 --> 11:36.733
Yes. His name is Bull Shannon.
He's a bailiff.

11:36.910 --> 11:38.707
He left here in...

11:38.879 --> 11:40.107
...an agitated state.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.716
Did anyone down there see him
leave the building?

11:44.385 --> 11:47.616
If you need a description,
you haven't seen him.

11:48.589 --> 11:50.818
- No one knows where he is?
- Apparently not.

11:51.124 --> 11:52.751
Harry, the set's warm.

11:52.925 --> 11:54.916
I don't believe you.

11:55.094 --> 11:58.063
Is that all you care about, a porno tape?

11:58.698 --> 12:00.063
What do you mean, about Bull?

12:00.233 --> 12:03.691
- Yeah.
- Come on. I'm crazy about the big lug.

12:03.870 --> 12:06.065
But there's nothing we can do
until he surfaces.

12:06.239 --> 12:08.833
Besides, as a representative
of the people of New York...

12:09.008 --> 12:11.203
...it is my duty to review all the evidence.

12:11.377 --> 12:12.901
It's a dirty movie.

12:13.312 --> 12:15.245
It's a dirty job.

12:16.281 --> 12:17.509
Dan's probably right.

12:17.682 --> 12:21.174
Maybe Bull just needs some time
to think things out, and then he'll be back.

12:21.353 --> 12:23.617
Meantime, there's nothing
we can do but wait.

12:23.789 --> 12:26.417
Well, as long as we're waiting.

12:26.591 --> 12:28.525
Yeah, okay.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.853
But keep in mind that
we're looking at this...

12:31.029 --> 12:33.793
...in terms of the statutory definition
of obscenity...

12:33.965 --> 12:36.433
...and not our own personal
opinions about...

12:40.171 --> 12:42.639
Oh, my God.

12:44.074 --> 12:46.599
Hey, there's no question about it.

12:46.777 --> 12:48.472
They're breaking the law.

12:49.513 --> 12:51.378
Of gravity.

12:55.052 --> 12:58.681
This one of those blue-jean
commercials?

12:59.523 --> 13:01.855
- Selma, is there any news?
- They spotted Bull.

13:02.026 --> 13:03.287
- Where?
- On the roof.

13:03.460 --> 13:05.451
You'll be able to see him
from your window.

13:05.628 --> 13:06.993
Roof?

13:07.697 --> 13:09.961
Oh, I read the book.

13:11.034 --> 13:12.934
This window won't open.
Can you see him?

13:13.102 --> 13:15.502
No. Nothing up there
but a bunch of gargoyles.

13:16.272 --> 13:18.832
Wait. Wait a minute.
One of them's moving.

13:19.576 --> 13:21.203
Oh, no. It's him.

13:21.377 --> 13:23.038
Bull!

13:23.446 --> 13:26.141
- What?
- What you doing?

13:26.682 --> 13:28.240
Thinking.

13:28.417 --> 13:32.376
- Harry, keep talking to Bull.
- I'm not exactly sure what to say.

13:32.554 --> 13:36.285
I wouldn't mention "the bigger they are,
the harder they fall."

13:36.458 --> 13:37.948
Well, thank you.

13:38.494 --> 13:40.325
Bull, we were just wondering...

13:40.496 --> 13:43.988
...you're not thinking about
doing anything weird, are you?

13:44.166 --> 13:48.830
- Like what?
- Oh, say, jumping, for example.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.638
- Bull?
- Are you nuts?

13:52.807 --> 13:54.741
Why don't you come down?

13:54.909 --> 13:58.743
I like it up here. Less people.
A man can think.

13:58.913 --> 14:02.679
- Bull!
- I'm not coming down! Leave me alone!

14:03.718 --> 14:05.345
Well, suggestions?

14:05.720 --> 14:10.282
And calling the Air Force is out.
He'd only swat down their planes.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.050
Perhaps you could...

14:15.228 --> 14:16.456
...lie.

14:17.597 --> 14:19.155
Well, I'm not above that.

14:19.332 --> 14:21.391
- Bull?
- I can't hear you.

14:21.568 --> 14:22.899
No, don't lean over! No! No!

14:23.069 --> 14:24.593
Bull!

14:25.372 --> 14:27.431
We need your help.

14:30.110 --> 14:33.739
Liz fell down and broke her leg,
and we can't move her.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.313
- What?
- That stinks.

14:35.482 --> 14:38.279
Would you help, Bull?
She's in a lot of pain.

14:38.450 --> 14:40.680
- Moan. Moan.
- No. It's silly.

14:40.853 --> 14:42.548
So is a contempt charge.

14:45.558 --> 14:47.958
Will you help us, Bull?
It's pretty bad.

14:50.362 --> 14:52.296
Bull, what do you say?

14:52.631 --> 14:55.361
- Okay. I'll be right down.
- Great. Great.

14:55.534 --> 14:58.298
No, no, no, no, no!
Take the long way.

15:05.343 --> 15:07.538
This doesn't smell like outside.

15:07.712 --> 15:10.010
- You again?
- The judge, right?

15:10.181 --> 15:13.514
- That's right.
- What is this place, a maze?

15:14.018 --> 15:15.679
I'll call security.

15:15.853 --> 15:20.085
Why can't they make those
"you are here" maps in Braille?

15:20.925 --> 15:22.358
Here you go, Mr. Foley.

15:22.527 --> 15:25.461
Why don't you just have a seat
right over here.

15:26.496 --> 15:29.556
- Bull.
- Yeah, okay. Where's?

15:30.767 --> 15:32.826
What's going on?
You don't look hurt to me.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.000
He lied.

15:36.907 --> 15:39.000
- I get it.
- Bull, I had to talk to you.

15:39.176 --> 15:42.202
Don't waste your breath.
It won't affect my decision.

15:42.379 --> 15:44.006
What decision?

15:46.183 --> 15:47.912
I've decided I'm gonna go away...

15:48.085 --> 15:51.611
...and not associate with any other
human beings as long as I live.

15:52.388 --> 15:55.585
Boy! Now that's what I call a decision.

15:55.758 --> 15:58.488
- Bull, you can't do that.
- Who's gonna stop me?

15:58.661 --> 16:00.822
Where would you go?
I mean, what would you do?

16:01.831 --> 16:03.059
Canada, maybe.

16:03.232 --> 16:04.790
I could be a lumberjack.

16:04.967 --> 16:08.266
Or I could go up to the North Pole,
one of those radar tracking stations.

16:08.604 --> 16:10.765
I don't care! People won't have to
deal with me.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.874
I won't have to deal with them,
which as far as I'm concerned...

16:14.042 --> 16:15.532
...is good riddance.

16:15.710 --> 16:17.644
Amen.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.604
Who are you?

16:21.282 --> 16:23.842
My name is Foley. Ralph Foley.

16:24.285 --> 16:25.775
Shut up, Ralph.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.117
Right.

16:28.490 --> 16:30.253
- I'm going. See you.
- So that's it.

16:30.425 --> 16:33.724
You're just gonna walk out
after we've worked together all these...

16:34.429 --> 16:36.124
...weeks?

16:36.297 --> 16:39.197
- Bull, we want you to stay.
- Yeah, that's right.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.231
We all do.

16:41.769 --> 16:43.202
Dan?

16:43.570 --> 16:45.561
I'll take a taco.

16:48.142 --> 16:49.370
I'm getting out of here!

16:49.543 --> 16:52.842
Okay. If that's the way you feel,
go ahead!

16:53.947 --> 16:55.175
Oh, come on. I was kidding.

16:55.349 --> 16:56.680
Bull.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.080
Bull, maybe this is
none of my business...

16:59.253 --> 17:02.619
...but frankly, I feel like you're acting
like a little child here.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.723
You're running away
from your problems...

17:04.891 --> 17:06.915
...instead of facing them like a man.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.556
This is my problem.
How can I run away from that?

17:10.730 --> 17:13.631
Boy, there's one thing I really hate,
it's self-pity.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.531
Hey, before you go away, pal...

17:16.803 --> 17:19.738
...I wanna, I wanna shake your hand.

17:22.474 --> 17:23.703
There.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.771
I never thought I'd meet the man...

17:25.944 --> 17:29.402
...who felt that his problem
was worse than mine.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.782
Why? What's your problem?

17:33.018 --> 17:34.986
I'm blind, man.

17:36.655 --> 17:37.952
Yeah, see?

17:38.123 --> 17:40.591
Dark glasses and a cane.

17:40.792 --> 17:43.886
I thought you were just being
fashionable.

17:44.796 --> 17:48.424
I'm afraid Bull doesn't pay much attention
to outward appearances, Mr. Foley.

17:48.599 --> 17:50.362
No? Well, me neither.

17:50.534 --> 17:52.559
But most people do.

17:52.737 --> 17:54.671
I get hauled in for shoplifting,
they say:

17:54.839 --> 17:58.605
"Oh, look at him.
Let the poor blind man go."

17:58.776 --> 18:00.539
But in a way, it works for me.

18:00.711 --> 18:05.478
- I had 15 busts, only four convictions.
- Actually, I think it's 19 arrests.

18:05.649 --> 18:06.877
Is that his arrest jacket?

18:07.051 --> 18:08.643
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

18:09.153 --> 18:10.381
Goodbye.

18:10.554 --> 18:12.384
Boy, Bull sure had this guy pegged.

18:12.789 --> 18:14.586
- What?
- Yeah, the evidence is all here.

18:14.758 --> 18:16.749
You're certainly guilty, Mr. Foley.

18:16.926 --> 18:19.952
- Maybe, but who's gonna send me up?
- I am.

18:20.130 --> 18:21.791
- Yeah, sure.
- I'm not kidding.

18:21.965 --> 18:23.762
That blind stuff didn't work on Bull...

18:23.933 --> 18:26.766
...it doesn't work on me either, right, Bull?
- Yeah, I guess.

18:26.936 --> 18:29.427
You wanna be treated like a criminal,
Mr. Foley?

18:29.606 --> 18:32.166
I'm gonna send you up for 14 months.

18:32.609 --> 18:34.236
That's a little rough, isn't it?

18:34.410 --> 18:37.867
- Hey, life is rough, isn't it, Bull?
- Yeah.

18:38.046 --> 18:40.606
- You're right, Bull. This guy is scum.
- I didn't say...

18:40.783 --> 18:44.219
I mean, some other judge might give him
probation because he's blind.

18:44.386 --> 18:47.549
You know, take pity. But Bull doesn't have
any pity for him, do you?

18:48.357 --> 18:49.984
- Well...
- And I don't either. No.

18:50.159 --> 18:53.856
What am I supposed to do, treat him nice?
I mean, remand him into the custody...

18:54.029 --> 18:56.293
...of some responsible person?

18:56.465 --> 19:00.195
Come on. What responsible person
would wanna help out...

19:00.368 --> 19:06.705
...a miserable, rotten, sneaky little
lowlife of a criminal like him?

19:14.849 --> 19:16.783
Can I have him?

19:18.085 --> 19:19.416
What?

19:19.587 --> 19:23.147
If you could see your way clear
to releasing him, Your Honor...

19:23.323 --> 19:26.656
...l'd accept the responsibility for him.

19:26.827 --> 19:29.352
Hey, what the hell is going on
around here?

19:29.796 --> 19:31.354
I don't know, Mr. Foley.

19:34.034 --> 19:35.467
Listen...

19:35.635 --> 19:37.262
...I just wanna help.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.665
You mind?

19:40.073 --> 19:41.802
Why do you wanna help?

19:44.878 --> 19:47.072
It makes me feel good.

19:48.147 --> 19:50.638
I don't get a chance all that often...

19:51.750 --> 19:53.149
...and I miss it.

19:54.453 --> 19:56.648
I guess I know what you mean.

19:57.223 --> 19:59.157
I used to help people too.

19:59.325 --> 20:02.920
But they don't ask me
quite as often anymore.

20:06.298 --> 20:08.061
I'm asking.

20:10.369 --> 20:11.596
Yeah.

20:11.769 --> 20:13.532
I guess you are.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.366
Come on, judge.
Give the kid a break.

20:19.210 --> 20:20.837
Let him have me.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.411
- Oh, I don't know.
- Come on!

20:24.315 --> 20:25.907
What about the North Pole?

20:26.084 --> 20:28.177
I still got my two weeks' vacation.

20:28.953 --> 20:33.390
Well, okay, but I'd feel better
if you were in a responsible position.

20:35.959 --> 20:38.894
- Is it official?
- As of this moment, you're back on the job.

20:39.062 --> 20:40.290
Great.

20:40.464 --> 20:42.056
Can I go to lunch?

20:44.768 --> 20:46.360
Come on, Ralph. I'll take you home.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.697
Okay, Bull.

20:52.175 --> 20:54.439
That stuff with me and Ralph...

20:55.245 --> 20:57.304
...I know what you did.

20:57.581 --> 20:59.309
It's my hobby.

20:59.982 --> 21:03.975
Oh, yeah?
Hey, mine is stamp collecting.

21:06.923 --> 21:09.756
Really? I'd like to see
your collection sometime.

21:09.926 --> 21:11.553
So would I.

21:15.031 --> 21:16.658
Watch your head.

21:23.371 --> 21:25.339
<i>Not bad, amigo.</i>

21:25.507 --> 21:27.407
<i>Gracias.</i>

21:28.143 --> 21:30.611
I'm starting to catch on to you,
you know.

21:30.779 --> 21:34.681
I saw those little wheels spinning
in your head.

21:34.849 --> 21:37.113
I knew that you had some kind of plan...

21:37.285 --> 21:43.520
...to bring those two people together
like a human jigsaw puzzle, without ever...

21:45.859 --> 21:47.656
We'll talk later.

21:55.769 --> 21:57.566
So?

21:57.738 --> 21:59.228
What do you think?

22:04.845 --> 22:06.870
Let's have a cigarette.

22:16.155 --> 22:17.520
Hello.

22:19.492 --> 22:21.483
I thought you quit.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.432
I'm back.

22:30.937 --> 22:32.871
I can see that.

22:33.272 --> 22:35.671
You know, I was worried about you.

22:35.841 --> 22:37.138
I'm sorry.

22:37.309 --> 22:38.640
You're sorry?

22:38.810 --> 22:40.835
Let me tell you something.

22:41.013 --> 22:42.844
Don't you ever...

22:43.015 --> 22:47.975
...pull any stunt like that again
while I'm around here.

22:48.153 --> 22:54.058
And don't you ever walk out
and leave me alone on the job.

22:54.226 --> 22:59.595
And don't you ever forget
that I have the seniority here...

22:59.764 --> 23:03.530
...and what I say goes.

23:04.535 --> 23:06.298
Yes, ma'am.

23:07.671 --> 23:10.970
- How about a beer at Muldoon's?
- Sure.

23:11.142 --> 23:13.770
It's your turn to buy.
