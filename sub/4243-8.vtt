03:08.808 --> 03:11.693
MARLEY: <i>When I was seven years</i>
<i>old, I had a dream.</i>

03:11.727 --> 03:14.145
<i>It's the first one</i>
<i>I actually remember.</i>

03:14.179 --> 03:17.398
<i>I was alone... on a stage</i>

03:17.449 --> 03:19.734
<i>wearing a beautiful dress.</i>

03:19.785 --> 03:21.286
<i>I couldn't see the audience,</i>

03:21.320 --> 03:24.405
<i>but I could feel</i>
<i>the full house.</i>

03:24.456 --> 03:30.745
<i>They had all come for one</i>
<i>reason: to hear me sing.</i>

03:30.796 --> 03:34.833
<i>And now, thanks to Glee Club,</i>
<i>with sectionals this week,</i>

03:34.867 --> 03:36.718
<i>that dream is about</i>
<i>to come true.</i>

03:36.752 --> 03:38.920
<i>Well, except the part where</i>
<i>Skeet Ulrich gave me</i>

03:38.971 --> 03:40.388
<i>a bouquet of kittens</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

03:40.422 --> 03:42.423
<i>My dreams are weird.</i>

03:42.474 --> 03:44.509
<i>Mom's doing great</i>
<i>with her diet.</i>

03:44.543 --> 03:46.060
<i>She's lost 12 pounds!</i>

03:46.095 --> 03:48.229
<i>I haven't lost quite as much,</i>

03:48.264 --> 03:50.648
<i>but I'm pretty sure I can see</i>
<i>a difference.</i>

03:50.683 --> 03:53.067
<i>I'm not letting up</i>
<i>until after sectionals, though.</i>

03:53.102 --> 03:57.438
<i>I've got to look my best</i>
<i>up there.</i>

03:57.489 --> 04:00.191
<i>I just want to be great</i>
<i>for all of them.</i>

04:00.225 --> 04:02.861
<i>I can feel how much</i>
<i>they're depending on me.</i>

04:02.895 --> 04:04.445
<i>I can't let them down.</i>

04:04.496 --> 04:06.364
<i>Especially them.</i>

04:07.366 --> 04:09.584
<i>The pressure is on,</i>
<i>Marley Rose,</i>

04:09.618 --> 04:11.502
<i>and it's like Mom always</i>
<i>says...</i>

04:11.537 --> 04:13.288
Don't blow it.

04:13.339 --> 04:16.207
PUCK: So I said, "You girls are
gonna need another cup."

04:16.241 --> 04:18.343
(laughter)

04:18.377 --> 04:21.346
Yeah, but, guys, I'd like
to propose a toast:

04:21.380 --> 04:23.014
To almost all of us keeping
our promise

04:23.048 --> 04:24.182
to come home for Thanksgiving.

04:24.216 --> 04:25.633
Cheers!
Cheers!

04:25.684 --> 04:26.584
Here's to us.

04:26.602 --> 04:29.854
Has anybody heard
from Rachel or Kurt?

04:29.889 --> 04:31.306
No. I know Blaine's been

04:31.357 --> 04:33.858
texting him, but
Kurt won't text back.

04:33.893 --> 04:35.310
Well, Rachel e-mailed me.
She said she's not really sure

04:35.361 --> 04:37.478
what she's doing
for the holidays yet.

04:37.529 --> 04:39.614
I'm sorry about what went down
with the two of you.

04:39.648 --> 04:42.450
No, it's cool.
It's for the best.

04:42.484 --> 04:43.484
Well, I think that it's sweet

04:43.535 --> 04:45.987
that you and Rachel
keep in touch, Quinn.

04:46.038 --> 04:47.622
Well, she basically e-mails me
every other week

04:47.656 --> 04:49.290
to remind me that I still
haven't used

04:49.325 --> 04:50.708
the train ticket
that she gave me.

04:50.743 --> 04:52.627
I'm just, I'm trying
to keep straight A's.

04:52.661 --> 04:53.795
And I just got tapped to be in

04:53.829 --> 04:56.331
the only female secret society
at Yale.

04:56.382 --> 04:59.000
Former members: Hillary Clinton,
Jennifer Beals.

04:59.051 --> 05:02.337
You go, girl.
(all chuckle)

05:02.388 --> 05:03.638
Well, I, for one, would love

05:03.672 --> 05:05.590
to talk about everybody
that <i>is</i> here.

05:05.624 --> 05:07.809
I have a favor to ask.

05:07.843 --> 05:09.310
(bell ringing)

05:09.345 --> 05:13.147
All right, do you realize,
standing before you are legends?

05:13.182 --> 05:15.483
(cheers and applause)

05:15.517 --> 05:17.602
Any single one of these guys
could be.

05:17.636 --> 05:19.687
President of the United States
one day.

05:19.738 --> 05:21.689
I don't know about that.
And lucky for us,

05:21.740 --> 05:23.191
they've agreed to help us...

05:23.242 --> 05:25.360
Hang with the new chumps
and see if some of

05:25.411 --> 05:27.578
our sheer awesomeness
doesn't rub off on you.

05:27.613 --> 05:29.347
It will.

05:29.381 --> 05:31.082
When you hear your name,
pair up.

05:31.116 --> 05:32.316
Puck, you're with your brother.

05:34.486 --> 05:36.754
Mike, you're with Ryder.

05:36.789 --> 05:39.607
Marley, you're with Santana.

05:39.642 --> 05:41.009
Kitty, you're with Quinn.

05:41.043 --> 05:43.177
Oh!
Wade, Mercedes.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.430
Sashay.
<i>Enchanté.</i>

05:45.464 --> 05:47.215
I knew it.
Mercedes was cloned.

05:47.266 --> 05:51.135
Now, your mentors are here to
help you with whatever you need:

05:51.169 --> 05:52.353
Singing, dancing...

05:52.388 --> 05:53.471
Birth control.

05:53.505 --> 05:55.857
You're so funny and
self-deprecating!

05:55.891 --> 05:57.392
We're so much alike!

05:57.443 --> 05:58.476
Wanky.

05:58.510 --> 05:59.944
The worst mistake
that we can make

05:59.979 --> 06:01.129
is to underestimate
our competition.

06:01.163 --> 06:02.947
The Warblers are ruthless
this year.

06:02.982 --> 06:04.615
Don't forget about
the Rosedale Mennonites.

06:04.650 --> 06:07.368
Any show choir that can
raise a barn in five minutes

06:07.403 --> 06:08.953
deserves mad respect.

06:08.988 --> 06:11.406
Marley and Blaine will handle
our duet,

06:11.457 --> 06:15.126
and for the showstopper
we're doing "Gangnam Style."

06:15.160 --> 06:16.577
Okay, lumps,
let me just say out loud

06:16.628 --> 06:18.079
what everyone here is thinking:

06:18.130 --> 06:20.548
You finally got an okay haircut,
you're not doing

06:20.582 --> 06:23.801
that annoying half smirk
as much as you used to,

06:23.836 --> 06:26.220
but you're still a idiot.
No one in this room

06:26.255 --> 06:28.923
can tackle a massive dance
number except for Brit.

06:28.974 --> 06:30.925
That includes your little
"Hand-Jive"

06:30.976 --> 06:33.061
that, to me, looked more
like a hand...

06:33.095 --> 06:35.179
Is there any way Mr. Shue
can come back for this?

06:35.213 --> 06:38.149
Listen to me, we have never lost
sectionals before,

06:38.183 --> 06:40.651
and there's no way we're
gonna do it under my watch.

06:40.686 --> 06:43.154
We can and we will succeed!

06:43.188 --> 06:46.657
We need an ambitious number
with a strong dance element.

06:46.692 --> 06:48.910
That's the Warbler's calling
card, and we need to blow them

06:48.944 --> 06:50.862
out of the water. And Mike said
he could easily show

06:50.896 --> 06:53.031
one of our guys how to do
the dance number. I did?

06:53.065 --> 06:56.117
Crap. I, uh, I kind of forgot
to ask you about that.

06:56.168 --> 06:58.086
But one of our guys
is gonna have

06:58.120 --> 07:01.422
to take the lead with Brit.
So who's it gonna be?

07:01.457 --> 07:02.874
Hello? White Chocolate.

07:02.908 --> 07:05.009
(beatboxing)

07:05.044 --> 07:08.513
MERCEDES:
Oh, no, no, no. Um...

07:08.547 --> 07:09.714
(bell ringing)

07:09.748 --> 07:11.599
Hey, I can't believe
that we have to dance

07:11.633 --> 07:12.850
for this guy who's
getting trained

07:12.885 --> 07:14.018
at the Joffrey Ballet School.

07:14.053 --> 07:15.303
He's gonna think
I'm special needs.

07:15.354 --> 07:16.637
Listen, man, I need to talk

07:16.688 --> 07:17.805
to you about something else.

07:17.856 --> 07:20.892
Last Friday...

07:20.926 --> 07:22.777
I kind of went out with Marley.

07:22.811 --> 07:24.145
Kind of?

07:24.196 --> 07:25.897
I mean, we didn't
actually go anywhere.

07:25.931 --> 07:28.316
We just kind of hung out
and played SongPop

07:28.367 --> 07:29.317
and Bad Piggies all night.

07:29.368 --> 07:31.369
So this is like a thing?

07:31.403 --> 07:33.905
Not if it's gonna make us
mortal enemies again.

07:33.939 --> 07:36.791
I'll end it if you want me to,
but for the record,

07:36.825 --> 07:39.660
I wasn't just gonna
hump her and dump her.

07:39.711 --> 07:42.230
Marley's different,
she's special.

07:44.383 --> 07:47.251
No, don't break it off
because of me.

07:49.171 --> 07:50.388
Yeah?

07:50.422 --> 07:52.090
Yeah, but you better not snake

07:52.124 --> 07:54.308
the dance lead from me,
all right?

07:54.343 --> 07:57.011
You don't get to have
everything at this school.

07:57.062 --> 07:58.396
That's all yours, dude.

07:58.430 --> 08:01.682
I don't have any end
zone moves anyway.

08:01.733 --> 08:04.602
RACHEL: So I found out that I
didn't get cast in <i>Glass Menagerie,</i>

08:04.636 --> 08:06.687
KURT: Oh! But the NYADA
Showcase is this week,

08:06.738 --> 08:08.689
so I'm gonna spend the whole,
long holiday weekend

08:08.740 --> 08:11.409
just really prepping for it to
make sure that I get it. Good.

08:11.443 --> 08:12.860
Did you put in
your application?

08:12.911 --> 08:15.696
Yes, and I put it on Vogue.com
stationery so it'd stand out.

08:15.747 --> 08:17.415
I'm really feeling good
about us staying home

08:17.449 --> 08:18.616
for the weekend, don't you?

08:18.650 --> 08:20.201
Yeah, yeah. Yeah-yeah-
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.

08:20.252 --> 08:22.870
We don't have to go home
just because there's a show

08:22.921 --> 08:24.622
or because it's
a long weekend, right?

08:24.656 --> 08:25.873
Right, no.
I mean,

08:25.924 --> 08:26.958
even though it's Thanksgiving,

08:26.992 --> 08:29.794
and sectionals, and
all our friends are there,

08:29.828 --> 08:31.212
and I miss my dad.

08:31.263 --> 08:34.465
I miss my dads, too,
but I just feel like every time

08:34.499 --> 08:36.384
we go home,
it just makes me feel sad

08:36.434 --> 08:38.102
and like we're not like
moving forward, you know?

08:38.136 --> 08:39.854
And even though we don't have
our boyfriends,

08:39.888 --> 08:41.472
we still have our dreams
and our ambition.

08:41.506 --> 08:42.557
And each other.

08:42.607 --> 08:44.559
Yes. You are the only
significant other I need

08:44.610 --> 08:45.710
in my life.
Oh...

08:45.744 --> 08:47.445
I have to just, you know,
forget about Finn

08:47.479 --> 08:48.696
and forget about Brody.

08:48.730 --> 08:50.314
Forget about Blaine.

08:50.348 --> 08:53.034
Yeah, forget any guy who's broke
an girl or guy's heart, okay?

08:53.068 --> 08:54.702
We are on the verge of becoming

08:54.736 --> 08:56.737
the best versions of ourselves.
Can't you feel it?

08:56.788 --> 08:58.072
For the first time,
probably because

08:58.123 --> 08:59.574
it's easier just
to drink your Kool-Aid,

08:59.625 --> 09:02.243
than go against you.
I know what you mean.

09:02.294 --> 09:03.995
Look. Look at our life.

09:04.029 --> 09:05.463
Look at this city!
Yeah.

09:05.497 --> 09:08.216
I know that it can be a little
sad and lonely sometimes,

09:08.250 --> 09:09.884
but I promise you,

09:09.918 --> 09:14.088
we are gonna have the
best Thanksgiving ever.

09:14.139 --> 09:15.640
Pinkie promise?

09:15.674 --> 09:17.425
Pinky promise.

09:24.985 --> 09:26.202
(synthesizer pop plays)

09:26.253 --> 09:27.503
Okay, fellas,

09:27.538 --> 09:29.872
Korean boy bands have
been tearing up the music scene,

09:29.923 --> 09:31.924
and there's a lot
we can learn from them.

09:31.959 --> 09:33.843
Follow my lead.

Let's pick it up, man.

09:47.441 --> 09:48.558
Come on, you guys
gotta feel it.

09:48.609 --> 09:50.476
Here we go.
Hands, hip, quick feet.

09:50.510 --> 09:52.895
Easy, Sam. You look like you're
trying to mount someone.

09:52.946 --> 09:55.364
This was what I call
"The Big Tipper."

09:55.399 --> 09:56.532
Big bills always came flying.

09:56.567 --> 09:59.068
Ryder, looking good, man.

09:59.119 --> 10:01.788
Those moves are legit, son.

10:01.822 --> 10:02.822
Seriously, Jake?

10:02.856 --> 10:04.907
Even I can do
better. Come on.

10:04.958 --> 10:07.043
Dude, lay off, okay?
This isn't my style.

10:07.077 --> 10:08.995
Show some more.
Here we go.

10:11.965 --> 10:13.216
Whoo!

10:13.250 --> 10:14.717
Oh, this battle is over.

10:14.751 --> 10:16.803
Looks like we got our new
Gangnam front man right here.

10:16.837 --> 10:21.257
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, gotcha,
gotcha, gotcha ♪

10:21.308 --> 10:22.809
♪ Wow, fantastic, baby.

10:22.843 --> 10:24.594
Along with being beautiful,
the three of us

10:24.645 --> 10:26.679
are National Showchoir
Championship goddesses.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.247
We are winners.

10:28.282 --> 10:30.633
Which is why Finn has asked
us to come and shower you

10:30.667 --> 10:33.436
with the inspiration
that is the Unholy Trinity.

10:33.487 --> 10:34.987
Santana, Brittany and I
knew each other so well

10:35.022 --> 10:36.772
that I could tell by
the slightest quiver

10:36.824 --> 10:39.242
in Santana's upper lip which way
we were gonna move.

10:39.276 --> 10:41.661
Whether our hips
are gonna shake or shimmy.

10:41.695 --> 10:44.197
No. You girls have to be
tight up there, okay?

10:44.231 --> 10:46.165
The judges love the
feminine quality,

10:46.200 --> 10:47.834
and the Warblers
just don't have it.

10:47.868 --> 10:49.502
It's about being individuals.

10:49.536 --> 10:50.620
You know, we're all different.

10:50.671 --> 10:52.588
But it's also about
synchronicity.

10:52.623 --> 10:54.157
Can you give us an example?

10:54.191 --> 10:55.842
It's been a few months,

10:55.876 --> 10:57.627
but I'm the three of us could

10:57.661 --> 11:00.129

You look like you're gonna hurl.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.064
Um, I think
I'm just really tired

13:15.098 --> 13:16.265

KITTY: <i>Now that we're alone,
can I tell you a secret?</i>

13:21.855 --> 13:23.406
Of course.

13:23.440 --> 13:24.857
If Finn
hadn't paired us together,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.575
I would've thrown such a hissy.

13:26.610 --> 13:27.943
Why is that?

13:27.995 --> 13:30.780
Because you're Quinn Fabray,
and I idolize you.

13:30.831 --> 13:32.531
You're Cheerios royalty.

13:32.565 --> 13:34.417
Can I show you something?
Sure.

13:34.451 --> 13:37.086
Every day, I ask myself,

13:37.120 --> 13:38.287
"What would Quinn Fabray do?"

13:40.240 --> 13:42.591
It's really nice to know
that people still remember me.

13:42.626 --> 13:43.759
Remember you?

13:43.794 --> 13:45.928
Oh, no, we aspire to
be you, me especially.

13:45.962 --> 13:47.380
What's with Marley?

13:47.414 --> 13:49.432
She seemed a little out of it
during rehearsal.

13:49.466 --> 13:50.966
Oh, that one?

13:51.018 --> 13:52.134
She's sweet as pie,

13:52.185 --> 13:53.853
and I've tried to be
a good friend to her,

13:53.887 --> 13:56.022
but ever since she started
dating Jake Puckerman,

13:56.056 --> 13:57.807
I fear she's on the wrong path.

13:57.858 --> 14:01.143
Word is he's pressuring her
to swipe her V-card.

14:01.194 --> 14:02.311
If that were to happen,

14:02.362 --> 14:04.313
well, no one knows the
dangers of a good girl

14:04.364 --> 14:07.033
mixing with a Puckerman
better than you.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.652
I can't believe that you're
not dancing with Brittany.

14:09.703 --> 14:11.120
I've seen you.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.988
You're incredible.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.707
You told me that you love it.

14:14.741 --> 14:16.208
You take lessons.

14:16.243 --> 14:18.327
It's kind of an honor amongst
bro thing with Ryder.

14:18.378 --> 14:20.129
Look, he's being really cool
about you and me,

14:20.163 --> 14:21.297
and he wants the solo,

14:21.331 --> 14:23.165
so I'm just trying
to do him a solid.

14:23.216 --> 14:24.917
Even if that means
we lose sectionals?

14:24.951 --> 14:26.585
(sighs)

14:26.619 --> 14:27.837
Ryder's gonna be great.

14:27.888 --> 14:29.505
I promise.

14:29.556 --> 14:30.673
I will make sure he's great.

14:30.724 --> 14:32.141
Now can I walk you
to lunch please?

14:32.175 --> 14:33.509
You've been skipping out
on me all week.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.760
Can't. I have to rehearse.

14:34.794 --> 14:37.263
Because I'm not gonna be the one

14:37.297 --> 14:39.065
who lets the team down.

14:41.134 --> 14:42.935
(bell ringing)

14:44.404 --> 14:45.688
Uh, guys, listen up.

14:45.739 --> 14:47.940
Ms. July said that
she does not want to teach today

14:47.974 --> 14:50.192
because she can't stand
to be in the same room

14:50.243 --> 14:52.278
as your mediocrity again.

14:52.312 --> 14:54.530
If you ask me,
she just sounds super hung over.

14:54.581 --> 14:56.949
Either way, I will be
teaching Dance 101 today.

15:02.422 --> 15:03.756
Is there a problem?

15:03.790 --> 15:06.125
Well, you know, everyone here
pays like, $30,000 a year

15:06.159 --> 15:08.127
to be taught by a professional
and not a T.A.

15:08.161 --> 15:10.379
I'm sorry, are you angry at me
about something?

15:10.430 --> 15:13.182
You mean, besides the fact
that you slept with Cassie?

15:13.216 --> 15:15.017
And why do you care
who I sleep with?

15:15.051 --> 15:16.569
Do I really need to answer that?

15:16.603 --> 15:18.354
Hey, I'm the one
who came on to you,

15:18.388 --> 15:20.222
remember? You broke
off our date

15:20.273 --> 15:22.374
to see another guy.
Yeah, well, that's over now.

15:22.409 --> 15:24.527
And what, so I'm supposed
to have retroactively known

15:24.561 --> 15:26.979
that that was gonna happen
and not slept with Cassie?

15:27.013 --> 15:28.647
All right, guys,

15:28.681 --> 15:31.400
let's, uh, let's pair up and
start with a basic fox-trot.

15:31.451 --> 15:33.452
(music begins)

15:35.622 --> 15:37.406
We're not in high
school anymore, okay?

15:37.457 --> 15:39.325
We're adults

15:39.359 --> 15:40.993
making adult choices.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.578
You made yourself unavailable.

15:42.629 --> 15:44.497
Don't be that crazy girl

15:44.531 --> 15:46.081
who expects people
to read her mind.

15:46.133 --> 15:49.001
Well, I'm sorry, but you don't
have to be a mind reader to know

15:49.035 --> 15:50.219
that she is my mortal enemy.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.004
Did it at least suck?
Are you kidding?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.089
It was amazing. Have
you seen her ass?

15:54.141 --> 15:57.426
Look, but I know
that we're friends

15:57.477 --> 16:00.596
and I don't want
to hurt you, so...

16:00.647 --> 16:02.881
it won't happen again, okay?

16:04.434 --> 16:06.435
Okay.

16:06.486 --> 16:07.937
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

16:07.988 --> 16:09.605
Going back to Ohio?

16:09.656 --> 16:10.940
No, Kurt and I are doing

16:10.991 --> 16:14.109
our little private
orphan Thanksgiving here.

16:14.161 --> 16:15.861
Wow, that sounds awful
and depressing,

16:15.895 --> 16:17.613
especially since I've tasted
your cooking.

16:17.664 --> 16:19.114
(chuckles)
All right, guys, come on.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.583
Let's take it from the top.

16:20.617 --> 16:23.369
And this time,
can we actually try?

16:25.121 --> 16:27.173
So I can't afford
to go home this year.

16:27.207 --> 16:30.876
How about I come over
and cook for you guys?

16:32.912 --> 16:35.297
Yeah, that would be great.

16:35.348 --> 16:36.799
Do you mind if I bring Cassie?
Oh, shut up.

16:36.850 --> 16:38.601
Just dance with me.
Okay.

16:38.635 --> 16:41.303
PUCK: That's a real solid you're
doing for that Ryder dude.

16:41.354 --> 16:43.556
"Bros before hos" was always
my mantra in high school.

16:43.590 --> 16:46.475
Well, it was after I knocked up
my best friend's girlfriend.

16:46.526 --> 16:48.310
Oh, speak of the devil
I knocked up.

16:48.361 --> 16:49.478
Back off of Marley.

16:49.529 --> 16:50.613
Excuse me?

16:50.647 --> 16:51.647
I got this, little bro.

16:51.698 --> 16:53.148
See that furrowed brow,
lips pursed,

16:53.200 --> 16:54.650
hand on her hip,
this is what I like

16:54.701 --> 16:55.784
to call "Loopy Quinn."

16:55.819 --> 16:56.952
It's an irrational state

16:56.987 --> 16:58.737
that she apparently only
reserves for Puckermans.

16:58.771 --> 17:00.322
He's messing with her head.

17:00.373 --> 17:01.657
He's pressuring her
to have sex th him.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.459
Who told you that?
I don't need somebody to tell me

17:03.493 --> 17:05.160
that the biggest womanizer
in school

17:05.212 --> 17:07.046
is trying to take advantage
of the naive girl

17:07.079 --> 17:08.998
who just wants to
fit in and be loved,

17:09.049 --> 17:11.416
especially if the womanizer's
last name is Puckerman.

17:11.451 --> 17:13.219
You don't know me.
I'm a lot of thing he's not,

17:13.252 --> 17:14.502
and I would never do that
to Marley.

17:14.554 --> 17:16.505
I don't believe you.

17:16.556 --> 17:19.508
Quinn, I think you're being
a little out of line here.

17:19.559 --> 17:22.310
The only way
you're gonna win sectionals

17:22.345 --> 17:24.230
is if Marley's at her best.

17:24.263 --> 17:25.681
And if you keep distracting her,

17:25.732 --> 17:27.965
she's not going to be.

Hey.
Oh!

17:39.778 --> 17:41.362
Oh, Isabelle, I am so sorry.

17:41.413 --> 17:42.663
I thought I was
the last one here.

17:42.697 --> 17:43.998
Its okay. Actually,
I'm almost done.

17:44.032 --> 17:46.167
I'm just, um, proofing
the filmmaker roundtable.

17:46.568 --> 17:47.818
Oh, I love that article.

17:47.852 --> 17:49.236
Oh, good.
I love Christmas movies.

17:49.287 --> 17:50.871
Be honest, which one

17:50.906 --> 17:52.156
are you looking forward to
the most,

17:52.190 --> 17:53.574
<i>Les Miz</i> or <i>The Hobbit?</i>

17:53.625 --> 17:55.326
Oh, wow.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.660
I love Peter Jackson,

17:56.694 --> 17:59.330
but I'm obsessed
with the French Revolution,

17:59.364 --> 18:01.749
so, uh, I suppose it would have

18:01.800 --> 18:04.752
to be... a double feature.
A double feature?

18:04.803 --> 18:06.504
(chuckles)

18:06.538 --> 18:09.757
So, uh, do you have any
fantabulous Thanksgiving plans?

18:09.808 --> 18:11.759
For the last five years,
I always went to Gore Vidal's

18:11.810 --> 18:13.427
for dinner and Pictionary.

18:13.478 --> 18:16.263
But you know,
Gore passed away this year,

18:16.314 --> 18:17.731
so I don't know.

18:17.766 --> 18:19.266
I'll probably just get
some turkey pizza

18:19.317 --> 18:20.901
from Two Boots and, uh,

18:20.936 --> 18:22.269
recreate my first Thanksgiving

18:22.320 --> 18:23.437
in New York.

18:23.488 --> 18:25.739
Well, if you're interested,

18:25.774 --> 18:28.342
my roommate and I are hosting
a bit of an orphan's dinner

18:28.376 --> 18:29.527
out in Bushwick.

18:29.561 --> 18:31.195
Bushwick? Ooh.

18:31.229 --> 18:33.113
A rustic Thanksgiving.

18:33.165 --> 18:34.532
(chuckles)

18:34.566 --> 18:35.866
Can I bring some friends?
Of course.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.618
We'll have as many orphans

18:37.669 --> 18:39.420
as Mr. Bumble's workhouse,
right?

18:39.454 --> 18:41.121
Gruel for everyone.

18:41.173 --> 18:43.207
You seem in a better mood.

18:43.241 --> 18:44.291
You and your ex

18:44.342 --> 18:45.459
have a <i>rapprochement?</i>

18:45.510 --> 18:47.127
<i>Au contraire.</i>

18:47.179 --> 18:48.295
No, I'm closing the book

18:48.346 --> 18:50.464
to that sad saga.
I'm just...

18:50.515 --> 18:51.966
I'm done.
I'm done thinking about it.

18:52.017 --> 18:54.218
I'm done thinking if we're
gonna get back together,

18:54.252 --> 18:56.604
wondering if we should
get back together.

18:56.638 --> 18:57.972
No, it's over.

18:58.023 --> 18:59.690
I sent him a text.

18:59.724 --> 19:02.476
Said, "Please, stop calling me
to say you're sorry."

19:02.527 --> 19:03.777
What's done is done."

19:03.812 --> 19:05.062
You know.
Well, listen,

19:05.096 --> 19:08.482
nothing is better than being
single in New York City,

19:08.517 --> 19:11.068
but you know, if he's
been reaching out to you...

19:11.102 --> 19:12.319
Assuage his guilt?

19:12.370 --> 19:13.654
No, sorry, cheater.

19:13.705 --> 19:14.989
This petal needs to move on.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.790
In my experience,

19:16.825 --> 19:18.826
it's always easier
for me to move on

19:18.877 --> 19:20.794
if I've either
had my apology accepted,

19:20.829 --> 19:26.000
or in your case,
accepted an apology.

19:26.051 --> 19:27.635
You know,

19:27.669 --> 19:30.471
sometimes it's the not forgiving
that holds us back.

19:30.505 --> 19:32.339
(sighs)

19:32.390 --> 19:34.008
(bell rings)

19:34.059 --> 19:35.175
QUINN:
Try to make eye contact

19:35.227 --> 19:37.478
with the judges,
and don't be afraid

19:37.512 --> 19:38.596
to give them
a flirty little smile

19:38.630 --> 19:39.980
or maybe even a wink.

19:40.015 --> 19:41.682
You're really doing them
a favor.

19:41.733 --> 19:43.267
You're reminding them
of their youth

19:43.301 --> 19:44.685
and what might have been.

19:44.736 --> 19:45.853
I'm gonna write that down.

19:45.904 --> 19:48.305
You're the best mentor ever.

19:49.741 --> 19:51.859
Seriously, the best.

19:53.194 --> 19:54.478
<i>Hola.</i>

19:55.530 --> 19:57.698
That bitch is pure evil.

19:57.749 --> 19:59.533
I think she's sweet.
Really?

19:59.584 --> 20:01.535
Well, then why is she giving
my girl laxatives?

20:01.586 --> 20:03.037
Why are you going
through my bag?

20:03.088 --> 20:04.505
It's all part
of being a mentor.

20:04.539 --> 20:06.206
What is this, huh?

20:06.258 --> 20:07.541
And don't tell me

20:07.592 --> 20:09.793
it's 'cause the cafeteria food
binds you up.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.211
Those are like, from months ago.

20:11.263 --> 20:12.880
I forgot
they were even in there.

20:12.931 --> 20:14.381
Your pretty little liar
gave them to her.

20:14.432 --> 20:17.017
I can sense it thanks to my
psychic Mexican third eye.

20:17.052 --> 20:19.853
See, this is what my psych
professor calls projecting.

20:19.888 --> 20:22.056
You're projecting Kitty
onto me.

20:22.107 --> 20:24.191
Santana, we've graduated.
It's really time

20:24.225 --> 20:25.559
to get over this.
Get over what?

20:25.610 --> 20:27.144
You being jealous of me.

20:27.178 --> 20:30.147
And why would I
be jealous of you?

20:30.181 --> 20:31.532
And please don't tell me

20:31.566 --> 20:34.068
its because you're in some lame
secret Nazi sorority.

20:34.119 --> 20:35.619
Look, Homecoming weekend,

20:35.654 --> 20:37.321
I went
to Jodie Foster's clambake,

20:37.355 --> 20:38.405
and that professor

20:38.456 --> 20:39.740
that I was talking about,

20:39.791 --> 20:41.575
well, he's 35,

20:41.626 --> 20:43.243
smokes a pipe.

20:43.295 --> 20:44.878
Well, he's divorcing his wife

20:44.913 --> 20:47.331
who hasn't touched him
for three years.

20:47.365 --> 20:48.716
I'm dating him.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.084
Wow, Twitter update!

20:50.135 --> 20:51.585
Quinn is

20:51.636 --> 20:54.755
all excited about another guy
defining her life.

20:54.806 --> 20:56.173
And what are you excited about?

20:56.207 --> 20:57.725
Shaking pom-poms in Kentucky?

20:57.759 --> 20:59.893
I mean, you want everybody to
think that you're such a badass,

20:59.928 --> 21:01.878
but really you're just
a scared little girl

21:01.896 --> 21:03.314
with low self-esteem

21:03.348 --> 21:05.566
who's too frightened
to chase her dreams.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.101
Did Professor Patches
teach you that one

21:07.152 --> 21:09.403
in between quickies
on his office couch?

21:09.437 --> 21:11.388
Does he get so turned on

21:11.406 --> 21:13.824
by teen moms who barely
visit their kid?

21:13.858 --> 21:15.025
(gasps)

21:15.777 --> 21:16.994
What are you guys doing?

21:18.997 --> 21:20.998
Nothing.

21:24.953 --> 21:26.337
Quinn always was
a genius slapper.

21:26.371 --> 21:27.738
(bell rings)

21:27.756 --> 21:29.923
(Psy's "Gangnam Style"
plays over headphones)

21:29.958 --> 21:32.509
(muttering lyrics)

21:39.050 --> 21:40.801
Are you dancing

21:40.852 --> 21:42.686
or impersonating
a horny epileptic?

21:42.721 --> 21:44.438
Dude, I can't concentrate
on the moves

21:44.472 --> 21:46.423
until I memorize the words.

21:46.441 --> 21:48.442
(panting)

21:50.528 --> 21:52.429
<i>Najeneun...</i>

21:52.447 --> 21:54.615
<i>Najeneun ttasaroun...</i>

21:54.649 --> 21:56.099
I mean, seriously?

21:56.117 --> 21:57.434
Dude, it's Korean.

21:57.452 --> 21:58.902
Just sing gibberish. Who cares?

21:58.936 --> 22:00.120
And if you're concentrating

22:00.155 --> 22:01.772
on the dance moves,
you're doing it wrong.

22:01.790 --> 22:03.907
(sighs) Well, that's how
I work through everything.

22:03.941 --> 22:05.909
I learn the basics, practice
them over and over again,

22:05.943 --> 22:07.077
and eventually I get it.

22:07.111 --> 22:08.612
So, did you do an apple pie

22:08.630 --> 22:10.280
500 times before you had sex?

22:10.298 --> 22:12.115
(laughs)

22:12.133 --> 22:14.635
It's exactly what I did,
but I wore a condom

22:14.669 --> 22:16.253
so I didn't make
any apple fritters.

22:16.287 --> 22:17.621
(laughs) Look.

22:17.639 --> 22:20.624
Some things you can't
overthink, okay?

22:20.642 --> 22:22.292
You just got to let
it come natural.

22:22.310 --> 22:23.927
"Gangnam Style" isn't
about technique.

22:23.961 --> 22:25.962
It's about just
letting yourself go.

22:25.980 --> 22:27.631
Okay?

22:36.307 --> 22:37.941
I thought you said
you didn't have any moves.

22:37.975 --> 22:39.810
(music stops) You asked
me not to take everything

22:39.828 --> 22:41.111
from you and I respect that.

22:41.145 --> 22:43.113
Plus, it's kind of embarrassing

22:43.147 --> 22:44.147
that I'm trained in ballet.

22:44.165 --> 22:46.417
(laughs)

22:47.485 --> 22:48.702
Like, seriously?

22:48.753 --> 22:49.820
Like tutu and everything?

22:49.838 --> 22:51.872
It doesn't leave this room.

22:51.906 --> 22:54.208
Dude, you're obviously
better than me.

22:54.259 --> 22:56.126
If we want to win,
you should do it.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.127
How about

22:57.161 --> 22:58.829
I just help you get better?

23:00.849 --> 23:01.965
Okay.

23:01.999 --> 23:03.634
But if at any point
you want to bail,

23:03.668 --> 23:06.670
or get food,
or go get me food...

23:06.688 --> 23:09.523
Let's start by watching
this video one more time.

23:09.557 --> 23:13.644
Maybe we'll be
viewer 500 million.

23:13.678 --> 23:15.529
(music plays)

23:15.563 --> 23:17.064
There he goes.

23:21.752 --> 23:23.920
A bag?

23:23.954 --> 23:25.922
Yeah, I'm telling you, you put it
in the bag and it self-bastes.

23:25.956 --> 23:27.256
Tommy the turkey

23:27.291 --> 23:29.492
is not gonna go dry.

23:29.510 --> 23:31.210
Ina Garten would never cook
a turkey in a bag.

23:31.261 --> 23:33.096
Well, when Ina comes to cook
you Thanksgiving dinner,

23:33.130 --> 23:34.764
she can do as she pleases.

23:34.798 --> 23:35.998
But our bird

23:36.016 --> 23:37.717
is getting bagged.
Mmm.

23:37.768 --> 23:38.885
Guys, this is so great.

23:38.936 --> 23:40.603
Yeah, it's like
our own <i>Big Chill.</i>

23:40.637 --> 23:43.389
Yeah, but no one breaks
out into song. What?

23:43.440 --> 23:44.774
Now, Rachel, get over here

23:44.808 --> 23:46.008
and help me butter up Tommy.

23:46.026 --> 23:47.443
Okay, well, I'm a vegetarian

23:47.478 --> 23:49.896
so I can't eat it but
I guess I can touch it.

23:49.947 --> 23:52.515
Yeah. Okay, Mr. Tur...
I'm very sorry.

23:52.533 --> 23:53.516
Like that?

23:53.534 --> 23:55.401
You got to get it in there.

23:55.452 --> 23:57.520
Really show him
that you love him.

23:57.538 --> 23:59.622
You know?
Just like that.

23:59.656 --> 24:02.375
Is that good?
Yeah, like that.

24:03.660 --> 24:06.129
When you two are done
using that turkey

24:06.163 --> 24:08.131
as a courtship device,
would you put it in the oven?

24:08.165 --> 24:09.749
'Cause it's almost 5:00.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.251
Oh, my God, it's almost time
for sectionals to start.

24:12.302 --> 24:13.469
Why are they having it
on Thanksgiving anyway?

24:13.504 --> 24:14.754
I'm sure they figured
with everyone

24:14.805 --> 24:16.372
home for the holiday,
they would sell more tickets.

24:16.390 --> 24:18.591
Most high schools have football
games for Thanksgiving.

24:18.642 --> 24:19.842
I remember my first sectionals.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.310
I was so nervous.

24:21.345 --> 24:23.262
I gave myself this pep
talk in the mirror,

24:23.313 --> 24:26.983
and I just began my soulful
monologue by saying...

24:27.017 --> 24:28.651
MARLEY:
<i>You are ready for this.</i>

24:28.685 --> 24:31.654
<i>You look really good,</i>
<i>your voice is strong.</i>

24:31.688 --> 24:36.225
<i>It's time to make a little</i>
<i>girl's dream come true.</i>

24:36.243 --> 24:39.662
<i>I'm so hungry...</i>
<i>but at least</i>

24:39.696 --> 24:42.365
<i>my dress fits.</i>

24:47.838 --> 24:49.738
Wade... I mean,
Unique, you're back!

24:49.757 --> 24:52.842
Yes, in all her glory.

24:52.876 --> 24:55.511
And as you can see, Miss Marley,
she is ready for her close-up.

24:55.546 --> 24:57.346
I thought your parents didn't
want you wearing...

24:57.381 --> 24:58.631
They don't.

24:58.682 --> 25:00.016
They're trying to protect me.

25:00.050 --> 25:01.300
But what they need to understand

25:01.351 --> 25:03.186
is if I'm not being
true to myself at least

25:03.220 --> 25:05.188
when I'm performing,
then there won't be

25:05.222 --> 25:07.590
anything left inside
me to protect.

25:07.608 --> 25:09.809
So they can keep talking
about sending me to a camp

25:09.860 --> 25:11.644
for little boys who
like to wear dresses,

25:11.695 --> 25:14.597
but I will not and I cannot
be ashamed of who I am

25:14.615 --> 25:16.098
or how I look.

25:16.116 --> 25:17.366
You look beautiful.

25:17.401 --> 25:19.101
I think it's inspiring

25:19.119 --> 25:20.903
how brave and proud you are.

25:20.937 --> 25:22.321
I wish I was more like that.

25:22.372 --> 25:23.873
Stop.

25:23.907 --> 25:25.158
Hustle up, you two.

25:25.209 --> 25:26.659
You're gonna miss show circle.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.944
And welcome back, girl.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.613
What's show circle?
Come on.

25:30.631 --> 25:32.548
It's a tradition
before every competition.

25:32.583 --> 25:33.916
It's something Mr. Shue made up.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.885
And today I want to add to it.

25:35.919 --> 25:38.387
Joe, how about
you lead us in prayer?

25:38.422 --> 25:39.455
PUCK:
Whoa, dude, Old Testament.

25:39.473 --> 25:41.057
There's Hebrews here.
Yeah, okay.

25:41.091 --> 25:43.509
This is one of my favorite
Bible verses from Isaiah.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.228
Considering that the
Warblers are so good,

25:45.262 --> 25:47.513
and that it's the first
competition for a lot of you,

25:47.564 --> 25:48.731
I think it's appropriate.

25:48.765 --> 25:52.518
"So do not fear
because I am with you.

25:52.569 --> 25:53.686
"Do not be dismayed.

25:53.737 --> 25:55.855
"I will strengthen you,

25:55.906 --> 25:57.857
I will uphold you
with my righteous hand."

25:57.908 --> 26:00.409
And our righteous dance moves, amen.
All right!

26:00.444 --> 26:03.196
(indistinct chatter, applause)

26:03.247 --> 26:05.748
Ugh! Man, I-I remember
our first sectionals

26:05.782 --> 26:07.366
like it was yesterday.

26:07.417 --> 26:10.419
We came together as a
team because we had to.

26:10.454 --> 26:12.705
Because no one
outside our circle

26:12.756 --> 26:14.257
knew how much we'd been through,

26:14.291 --> 26:17.293
and how much
it meant to us to win it.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.994
This is our house.

26:19.012 --> 26:22.331
Look into the faces
of these graduates.

26:22.349 --> 26:24.217
They've been to

35:07.035 --> 35:08.819
If I timed this right,

35:08.870 --> 35:11.655
Robin will wake up just as the
New Directions hit the stage.

35:11.706 --> 35:13.073
She's a very fussy baby,

35:13.107 --> 35:15.659
so she'll be wailing through
their entire performance.

35:15.710 --> 35:17.327
Is this seat taken?

35:17.378 --> 35:20.213
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
(laughs)

35:20.248 --> 35:22.499
Oh, so good to see you.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

35:22.550 --> 35:24.134
You made it, didn't you?

35:24.168 --> 35:25.335

I love you guys.
Good job.

36:40.194 --> 36:41.411
(whispering):
Mr. Shue is here.

36:41.462 --> 36:42.412
(cell phone buzzing) What?

36:42.463 --> 36:44.464
What?
Yes.

36:49.921 --> 36:50.921
Hello?

36:51.923 --> 36:53.590
Hey.

36:53.641 --> 36:55.675
Can you hear me?
It's kind of loud out here.

36:55.709 --> 36:58.512
Um, yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

36:58.546 --> 37:00.547
Have you guys performed yet?

37:01.516 --> 37:03.049
Uh, no, not yet.

37:04.102 --> 37:06.069
Kurt, I just want you
to know that

37:06.104 --> 37:07.521
no matter...

37:07.555 --> 37:09.172
Just let me talk for a second.

37:09.207 --> 37:13.577
Look, you've... you've said
you're sorry a million times.

37:13.611 --> 37:15.412
And...

37:15.446 --> 37:16.947
I believe you.

37:16.998 --> 37:20.367
And I'm trying
to forgive you, but...

37:21.619 --> 37:23.453
...I'm just not there yet.

37:23.504 --> 37:26.523
But...

37:26.557 --> 37:30.427
it's Thanksgiving,
and it's sectionals, and...

37:30.461 --> 37:31.878
I miss you like crazy.

37:31.912 --> 37:35.999
And... I can't stand
not talking to you,

37:36.033 --> 37:38.034
even though I'm mad at you.

37:38.069 --> 37:40.370
'Cause you're still
my best friend.

37:41.422 --> 37:42.989
You're mine, too.

37:48.196 --> 37:51.148
At Christmas, we... we need to
have a mature heart-to-heart.

37:51.199 --> 37:53.033
And maybe if it's cold enough,

37:53.067 --> 37:54.618
we can go ice skating
on the Auglaize River,

37:54.652 --> 37:55.952
and get hot chocolate

37:55.987 --> 37:57.287
anywhere but the Lima Bean,

37:57.321 --> 37:58.955
because when I was
working there I saw a mouse.

37:58.990 --> 38:00.740
(laughs)

38:00.774 --> 38:03.477
So, uh, we're really gonna
see each other at Christmas?

38:03.511 --> 38:05.445
Yeah.

38:11.285 --> 38:13.587
Well, don't let any of those
hideous Warblers win.

38:13.621 --> 38:15.422
All right?

38:15.456 --> 38:16.640
Break a leg.

38:16.674 --> 38:18.675
Happy Thanksgiving.

38:21.062 --> 38:22.679
H-happy Thanksgiving.

38:24.365 --> 38:26.032
Kurt, I love you so much.

38:28.019 --> 38:30.020
I love you, too.

38:30.071 --> 38:32.272
(sniffles, phone beeps)

38:41.699 --> 38:44.084
(dance music playing)

38:53.327 --> 38:55.762
(music fades)

39:30.202 --> 39:32.337
You okay?

39:32.371 --> 39:33.621
Yeah.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.673
You don't look okay.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.427
Okay, fine, I'm not okay.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.463
Look, look...

39:43.248 --> 39:44.632
It's just nerves.

39:44.683 --> 39:45.717
It's a good thing.
You can use it.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.769
I don't know how
it's a good thing

39:47.803 --> 39:49.104
when I haven't slept in days,

39:49.138 --> 39:51.055
and I'm sweating

39:51.089 --> 39:52.774
when it's not even hot,

39:52.808 --> 39:54.943
and I feel like
if we don't win,

39:54.977 --> 39:56.728
it's going to be all my fault.

39:56.762 --> 39:59.481
I'm going to let
all you guys down.

39:59.532 --> 40:00.949
Finn, the graduates,
and my mom.

40:00.983 --> 40:02.150
Jake, you got a second?

40:03.152 --> 40:04.652
Not now. Can it wait?

40:04.703 --> 40:07.739
Not really. I need you
to take the dance lead.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.908
I think I sprained
my ankle during warm-ups.

40:09.942 --> 40:11.826
You're not limping.
What's going on?

40:15.113 --> 40:17.165
Look, it was really cool
what you did,

40:17.216 --> 40:19.000
but a few days
of rehearsal and practice

40:19.051 --> 40:20.468
doesn't make me as good as you.

40:20.503 --> 40:21.669
And you don't put in

40:21.720 --> 40:23.304
second-string QB
just to be nice.

40:23.339 --> 40:24.672
Because it's not
nice... the whole team

40:24.723 --> 40:26.758
suffers, and we <i>have</i>
to win this.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.982
Just do it, okay?

40:34.016 --> 40:35.817
(sighs) Yeah.

40:35.851 --> 40:36.818
