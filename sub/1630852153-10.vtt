But before they tear
buildings down,

00:16.967 --> 00:19.734
they hunt for
anything left behind.

00:19.867 --> 00:22.333
Look at that.
Is that ever sweet, eh?

00:22.467 --> 00:25.233
The man leading
the mission is Ted.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.834
It doesn't matter how old
the building is, where it is.

00:27.967 --> 00:30.233
At the end of the day,
I hunt for treasures.

00:30.367 --> 00:31.934
With help from
foreman, Justin.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.734
Oh!

00:33.867 --> 00:35.500
What do you think you
can sell these for?

00:35.633 --> 00:37.133
The rookie, Julien.

00:37.266 --> 00:38.567
Never gonna
guess what I found!

00:38.700 --> 00:41.333
- Come on, are you serious?
- Sweet.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.000
- And boss, Ryan...
- Okay!

00:43.133 --> 00:45.233
...Who isn't afraid to
get his hands dirty.

their goal is to

00:49.400 --> 00:51.300
sell their finds for as
much as they can...

00:51.433 --> 00:53.333
- Good deal.
- ...As fast as they can.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.233
- 100 bucks for all 4.
- You got a deal.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.767

This is really unique.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.100

01:05.467 --> 01:07.000
The Salvage Kings.

01:09.367 --> 01:12.133
I started off running
Priestly's salvage operation

01:12.266 --> 01:14.033
pretty much on my own.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.867
Justin joined me this year,
and he's been incredible,

01:17.000 --> 01:18.934
and become my
right-hand man.

01:19.066 --> 01:22.233
And then, Julien joined us.
He may be fresh,

01:22.367 --> 01:26.033
but he takes in everything
and he's got a bright future.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.600
We're a great team.
It's been a great year.

01:28.734 --> 01:31.333
I'm excited.

At the end of the year,

01:32.934 --> 01:35.100
Priestly holds a
big one-day sale.

01:35.233 --> 01:37.867
The goal is simple: sell as
much as they can and

01:38.000 --> 01:40.100
give all of their loyal
customers a chance to

01:40.233 --> 01:42.834
get some great deals on salvage.

01:42.967 --> 01:44.467
The sale is a few days away,

to do to get ready.

called downtown

01:54.567 --> 01:56.367

01:56.500 --> 01:58.166
It's a cool house
from the 50s.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.967
Very modern, very
contemporary for that time.

You expect to find
mid-century furnishings,

02:03.400 --> 02:07.567
some nice built-in teak bar,
or teak cabinets.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.166
This is an important
customer of ours so,

02:09.300 --> 02:11.533
I decided to come down and help
get the demolition going,

02:11.667 --> 02:13.100
and make sure Ted and
Justin don't spend

02:13.233 --> 02:14.233
all day down here.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.700
Looks like you should
wreck it. (laughs)

02:16.834 --> 02:19.800
I haven't been in this place so,
I don't know how much stuff is..

02:19.934 --> 02:22.000

or... in between.

02:22.133 --> 02:24.200
What do we got?
Half a day? A day?

02:24.333 --> 02:26.000
We'll give you as
much time as you need,

02:26.133 --> 02:27.567
but I would like you to be
done in about an hour or so.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.233
- An hour? Alright.
- You know what I mean?

02:29.367 --> 02:32.600
We never get much time in a
house prior to demolition.

02:32.734 --> 02:34.367

Ryan's here already,

there and have a look.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.500
Alright.

Handcuffs. (laughs)

confused and a little stumped.

Liverpool, England

05:35.200 --> 05:37.367

The last thing we want to do is
take 'em down and ruin 'em.

To be honest, the pews
may be a tough sell.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.233
Okay.

We got good air burn
under here.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.600
- So, what exactly is air burn?
- So, it's oxidization.

11:07.734 --> 11:11.066
It's just years of oxygen
hitting the wood and

11:11.200 --> 11:12.767
it just naturally darkens it.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.767
I think we can
broker a deal here.

- Against you?
- Sure.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.600
- I'm okay with that.
- How's that?

16:47.734 --> 16:50.600
My chances of winning this
competition are fairly low,

16:50.734 --> 16:52.667
just based off the
experience I have,

16:52.800 --> 16:54.934
but I think I can
take Justin on, for sure.

16:55.066 --> 16:56.533
- Loser pays for dinner.
- Somewhere nice.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.667
- Yeah.
- A sit-down, serve-us dinner.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.300
- Yes, a dinner.
- Okay, fine.

17:00.433 --> 17:01.000
- Deal.
- Deal.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.000
- Deal.
- Deal!

17:02.133 --> 17:03.100
That's a good deal.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.000
This is Ted's house.

17:04.133 --> 17:05.000
We're not gonna
compete with him.

I beat Julien, I'm happy.

We've got so much work
coming up in the next 6 months.

17:21.567 --> 17:22.967
So, we're gonna
clean up here.

17:23.100 --> 17:25.333
Gonna clean up. A lot of the
stuff's been here way too long.

We've been here 31 years.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.000
There's stuff that
was here when we came.

17:28.133 --> 17:29.967
Just sell it. Move it.

they tried selling all year.

It's the big thing: sell.

I'm Julien.
What can I help you with?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.300
I'm interested in this.

17:44.433 --> 17:45.567
First of all,
I'm not sure what it is.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.100
It's some vintage
type of incense burner.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.667
I'm Lynn.
This is my husband, John.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.200

17:52.333 --> 17:54.066
Never looking for
anything in particular.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.400
Just something
that catches our eye,

17:55.533 --> 17:56.633
catches our fancy.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.333
Find a few things that
we can put in the store.

17:59.467 --> 18:00.867
Oh, yeah, one of the
old-school phones?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.133
Yeah.

18:02.266 --> 18:04.567
We got that out
of an old farm.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.633
We found that inside of a trunk
in the basement of a house.

18:07.767 --> 18:11.367
- Open sesame!
- Wow.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.533
Vintage. Poker chips.

18:13.667 --> 18:18.033
I think it's right
out of Odd Fellow Order.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.133
Then, we like this.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.066
That really interested
me because

18:22.200 --> 18:23.734
I find secret societies
fascinating.

18:23.867 --> 18:25.266
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.900
The Independent Order of
Odd Fellow's is a secretive

18:28.033 --> 18:30.400
300-year-old society
based on the tenets of

18:30.533 --> 18:31.867
friendship, love, and truth.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.100
The Order counts among its
past membership

18:34.233 --> 18:36.000
American president
Ulysses Grant,

18:36.133 --> 18:37.800
and actor Charlie Chaplin.

18:37.934 --> 18:41.000
And, these pieces
here are actually, like,

18:41.133 --> 18:44.600
decorative symbols that would go
onto their ceremonial spears.

18:44.734 --> 18:46.667
You can see there are actually
notches on the top there.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.300
It's got the same
symbole there.

18:48.433 --> 18:50.567
- I noticed you had a...
- Checkerboard table.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.166
- This one here.
- Yeah, this one here.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.567
Clean that up
and clear coat it.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.166
Oh, yeah, it's a
beautiful piece. Okay, so,

18:57.300 --> 18:59.200
you guys want to do a
package deal on all that stuff?

18:59.333 --> 19:01.667
I think so. So, what's your
best price on all of it?

19:01.800 --> 19:04.834
600 with the
incense burner.

19:04.967 --> 19:06.633
I was thinking
more like half of that.

19:06.767 --> 19:09.900
- Four?
- Can't do four, no.

19:10.033 --> 19:13.834
I'm thinking
like 500 bucks, 550?

19:13.967 --> 19:14.700
Four?

19:14.834 --> 19:16.533
Julien is very
green as a seller.

19:16.667 --> 19:19.166

You can't be so rigid.

19:22.633 --> 19:24.133
- How are ya?

19:24.266 --> 19:26.266
They're looking at taking
the checkered table there.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.300
Beautiful piece. Like, you
see the crackly finish on that?

19:28.433 --> 19:30.033
- It's beautiful.
- You can't make that.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.233
So, what are we at here?

19:31.367 --> 19:33.800
I got 600 bucks right now
for a package deal on the table,

19:33.934 --> 19:37.800
the chips, the frame
with the two ceremonial pieces,

19:37.934 --> 19:38.967
and the phone.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.533

old-fashioned incense burner.

19:41.667 --> 19:42.867
The incense burner?
That's a good deal, guys.

- You're at 450?

19:46.200 --> 19:48.567
We were at 4.
He just went up 50.

How about 500?
500's good.

- 475.
- You're almost at 5 now.

- You're almost at 475.
- You're close.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.066
- 475, 500. You're pretty close.
- I stil like 450.

20:50.066 --> 20:53.467
Yeah, I think a little bit of
gasoline or mineral spirits

will probably
clean that right up.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.734
Well, don't use gasoline;
that's a little dangerous.

20:56.867 --> 20:59.533
Diesel fuel's a lot safer.

lightings because I do work

at Royal York Hotel,
and I love them.

I have them on the picture.

best lights in the city, so...

Oh, the price is going up
when you keep saying that.

22:34.633 --> 22:36.500
- (laughs)
- No, you price--

22:36.633 --> 22:39.834
I give whatever you say.
You're always reasonable.

2000 for the pair.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.700
I'm looking at
7500 for this door,

33:53.834 --> 33:56.400
for everything altogether.
7500.

33:56.533 --> 33:58.433
I'd hate to kick you,
but you know...

33:58.567 --> 34:00.767
- I was thinking like 3 grand.
- Oh, no, that's kicking.

34:00.900 --> 34:03.567
That's, that's too low.
Can you do 6 grand?

34:03.700 --> 34:07.433
You know what, all in...
5 is my max

34:07.567 --> 34:10.900
because I don't know how
long I'm gonna hold onto this.

34:11.033 --> 34:12.667
So, if that's something
you're willing to come to...

34:12.800 --> 34:15.300
I've gotta sell
these doors to Clayton.

34:15.433 --> 34:17.967
I don't think I can get another
buyer in the time we have.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.934
I'm not happy
with the 5 grand,

34:20.066 --> 34:22.066
but you know what;
I'll do it. I'll do 5 grand.

34:22.200 --> 34:23.667
- Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
- I'll do 5 grand.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.500
I think it's gonna look,
yeah-- I think it'll look good.

34:25.633 --> 34:26.567
They want to get their
best price and I need

34:26.700 --> 34:28.233
to get the cheapest price.
So, in the middle,

34:28.367 --> 34:30.533
that's where we landed
and it was fair.

34:30.667 --> 34:32.934

his closest competitor.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.867
- Yeah, I just sold these.
- Yeah, 900 bucks.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.033
Excellent. Okay. So,
after you're finished that,

34:43.166 --> 34:44.633
can you pick up those
revolving doors and

34:44.767 --> 34:46.867
load them into the
guy's truck out front?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.433
You sold the
revolving doors?

34:48.567 --> 34:50.133
- 5 grand.
- Come on!

34:50.266 --> 34:53.400
Come on, nothing, man.
Keep going!

34:53.533 --> 34:54.934

34:55.066 --> 34:56.934

34:59.800 --> 35:03.066
Ted still hasn't heard from
his best wood buyer, Niko,

35:03.200 --> 35:06.200
who he's hoping
will make it to the sale.

35:06.333 --> 35:08.433
Meanwhile, Julien's met a
buyer interested in the

35:08.567 --> 35:11.800
furniture he helped salvage
from Manitoulin Island.

35:11.934 --> 35:12.834
These are the tables
you were looking for?

35:12.967 --> 35:14.266
Yes, these are the ones.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.333
I'm Gail, and this is my
first time at National.

35:17.467 --> 35:19.834
So, these came out of an old
hunt and fishing lodge that

35:19.967 --> 35:24.100
we salvaged and tore down
up in Manitoulin Island.

35:24.233 --> 35:28.233
Look at all the twig furniture;
that's classic lodge stuff.

35:28.367 --> 35:30.433
That's nice, man.

35:30.567 --> 35:32.633
I'm very interested
in the smaller table.

35:32.767 --> 35:33.834
Okay.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.867
I think it's gonna fit
where I want it to fit better.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.667
It's perfect for my,
my gazebo.

35:38.800 --> 35:39.834
So, are there chairs?

35:39.967 --> 35:42.233
Yes, these were the
chairs that went with them.

35:42.367 --> 35:44.367
Handmade. Hand painted.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.467
They were built in the 30s,
original with the lodge.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.800
I really like those.

35:47.934 --> 35:50.266
I love seeing the face on
people when you can bring them

35:50.400 --> 35:52.166
up to something that
they're looking for and then

35:52.300 --> 35:53.333
you can give
them a good deal.

35:53.467 --> 35:56.033
We can do something
on the price?

35:56.166 --> 35:58.433
Shoot me a number.
What are you thinking?

35:58.567 --> 35:59.834
150?

35:59.967 --> 36:00.934
Oh, I don't know
if I can do 150.

- Yeah.

do you want to take?

36:03.800 --> 36:04.867
I would like 4.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.800
Would you do 350 for
the table and chairs?

36:08.934 --> 36:10.066
I would do 350.
I really would.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.166
