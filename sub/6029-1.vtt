Anything?

05:11.644 --> 05:13.413
He's not up here.
Go back down.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.893
I'm talking to you.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.728
We've received information

09:22.762 --> 09:25.031
concerning your
involvement in espionage.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.066
You can either cooperate
with us right now,

09:27.099 --> 09:28.701
or you'll be under arrest.

09:28.734 --> 09:29.669
Do you understand, Colonel?

09:29.702 --> 09:31.637
No, not really.

keep calling me "Colonel"?

to get dressed.

your apartment.

09:38.878 --> 09:42.949
Would you mind if I, uh,
cleaned my palette?

09:42.982 --> 09:45.785

it'll get ruined otherwise.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.153
It's just behind you there.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.123

in the ashtray on the windowsill there?

BATES: Yes, he's "your guy."
Who are we talking about?

10:37.837 --> 10:41.774
We're talking about a guy
who was insured by my client.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.776
So, don't make him "my guy."

10:44.777 --> 10:46.312
BATES: Okay, fine.

10:46.345 --> 10:49.915
My point is, the guy
insured by your client,

10:49.949 --> 10:52.718
he doesn't deny that
any of these things happened.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.287
"These... These things"?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.957

these five things.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.759
Wait, hold it,
hold it, hold it.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.060
Not five things.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.062
One thing.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.196
BATES: Clearly,
it's five things.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.965
Well, I'm sorry,
it's not clear to me.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.801
Five things?
Explain it to me.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.069
BATES: It's self-evident.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.971
Okay, then tell me
what happened.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.341
Tell me the story in a way
that makes sense for five things.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.777
Fine, absolutely.
Your guy is...

11:17.810 --> 11:19.145
Not my guy.
Insured by my client.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.813
The guy insured
by your client

11:20.846 --> 11:22.314
is driving down
State Highway 19

11:22.348 --> 11:24.950
when he loses control
of his car and hits my five guys,

11:24.984 --> 11:27.086
the five guys who hired me
to represent them

11:27.119 --> 11:28.554
because you're not
honoring your claim.

11:28.587 --> 11:32.291
You mean my client is not
honoring the claim, the insurance company?

11:32.324 --> 11:34.960
(CHUCKLES) Mr. Donovan,
we're all clear on who's who, here.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.797
Except my client
honors every claim.

11:37.830 --> 11:38.931
They do, Mr. Bates.

11:38.964 --> 11:40.299
Every single
legitimate claim,

11:40.332 --> 11:41.967
up to the limit
of their liability,

11:42.001 --> 11:44.136
which is $100,000
per accident,

11:44.170 --> 11:46.305
in the case of
this man's policy.

11:46.338 --> 11:47.506
And this is one claim.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.243
According to your description,
"He hit my five guys."

11:51.277 --> 11:54.280
The guy insured by my client
had one accident.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.548
One, one, one.

11:55.581 --> 11:59.118
Losing control of the car and
hitting five motorcyclists.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.353
From their point of view,
five things happened.

12:02.421 --> 12:05.224
Well, look, Bob.
May I? Bob?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.327
"Jim."

12:08.360 --> 12:11.130
If I go bowling and I throw
a strike, one thing happened.

12:11.163 --> 12:12.231
Ten things didn't happen.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.300
Jim, my guys
aren't bowling pins,

12:14.333 --> 12:16.035
as much as your guy
may have treated them as such.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.369
If... Let me finish.
Let me finish.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.206
If your house
is insured for $100,000

12:20.239 --> 12:22.241
and a tornado
carries it away,

12:22.274 --> 12:23.943
it carried away one house.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.411
It didn't pick up
every stick of furniture

12:25.444 --> 12:28.114
and destroy it
in a separate incident.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.883
If that is
what you're saying,

12:30.916 --> 12:34.153
well, then there is never
any limit to our liability

12:34.186 --> 12:37.189
and that is the end
of the insurance business.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.391
And then, Bob,
nobody is safe.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.299
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.
How may I direct your call?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.968
Morning, Mr. Donovan.

12:49.001 --> 12:50.302
Good morning, Alison.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.271
I moved your 9:00 a.m.
with Prudential, sir.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.405
Why did you do that?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.007
I asked her to.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.276
Is everything
all right, Tom?

12:57.309 --> 12:59.979
Why don't you leave your stuff with Alison.
Come on inside.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.414
Something pretty important
has come up.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.183
Somebody's here to see us.

13:04.216 --> 13:06.051
Natalie's getting
your coffee.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.854
Nescafe, cream, two lumps,
right?

13:08.888 --> 13:10.156
That's right. Thanks.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.425
Lynn!
Jim!

13:13.459 --> 13:15.327
Nice to see you again.
How's the family?

13:15.361 --> 13:17.163
Great, good. Thanks.
How's Annie?

13:17.196 --> 13:19.431
Homicidal. We had
the in-laws for the holiday.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.333
Well, if she acts on it,
she'll have good representation.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.468
(LAUGHS)

13:22.501 --> 13:24.036
Now, what's up?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.378
Okay, here's the thing.

13:32.411 --> 13:35.915
The Soviet spy they caught,
we want you to defend him.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.216
Here's the indictment.

13:40.419 --> 13:41.420
Wow.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.157
I'm not sure
I wanna pick that up.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.226
The accused
doesn't know any lawyers.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.195
The federal court
tossed it into our lap.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.431
The Bar Committee took a vote.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.266
You're the unanimous choice.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.901
It was important to us...

13:55.935 --> 13:57.236
It's important
to our country, Jim,

13:57.269 --> 13:59.205
that this man is seen
as getting a fair shake.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.240
American justice
will be on trial.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.175
Well, of course,
when you put it that way,

14:03.209 --> 14:05.177
it's an honor to be asked.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.112
But, Lynn,
I'm an insurance lawyer.

14:07.146 --> 14:09.081
I haven't done
criminal work in years.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.116
It's like riding a bike,
isn't it?

14:11.150 --> 14:13.219
You distinguished yourself
at Nuremberg.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.954
I was on
the prosecution team.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.222
Not the point.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.615
You're no stranger
to criminal law.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.292
Jim, look at the situation.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.361
The man is publicly reviled.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.395
And I will be, too.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.264
Yes, in more
ignorant quarters.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.132
But that's exactly why
this has to be done,

14:27.166 --> 14:29.235
and capably done.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.237
It can't look like
our justice system

14:31.270 --> 14:32.430
tosses people
on the ash heap.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.246
Suppose I did,
what's the evidence look like?

14:41.513 --> 14:43.015
Pretty overwhelming.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.517
Great. Great.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.187
Everyone will hate me
but at least I'll lose.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.322
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

14:50.356 --> 14:52.424
Well, what do
you think, Tom?

14:52.458 --> 14:55.127
The firm will suffer.
I have work here.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.196
I think
it's a patriotic duty.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.198
It's an important mission.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.433
I told Lynn,
the firm can't say no,

15:01.467 --> 15:03.535
and you'd have a tough time
saying no, too.

15:05.137 --> 15:08.007
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.042
So, you're doing it?

15:10.075 --> 15:11.410
JAMES: Doing what?

15:11.443 --> 15:14.446
Defending Abel,
the Soviet spy.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.781
I may. I have to speak to...

15:15.814 --> 15:18.450
Wait, how do you know?
Did they post it on the bulletin board?

15:18.484 --> 15:20.552
No, I... I was
talking to Richard Earl...

15:20.586 --> 15:22.488
Look, if I do this,
I'm going to need your help.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.025
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

15:26.058 --> 15:27.293
Can you work tonight?

15:29.161 --> 15:30.401
Well, I have
a dinner date, sir.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.302
It's Tuesday, right?
Yeah, no, I'm free, completely free.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.436
Thank you, sir.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.309
JAMES: But it's also an honor.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.444
And the Bar Association
asked me

15:45.477 --> 15:47.246
because they want
to show that even a spy

15:47.279 --> 15:49.048
gets a capable advocate.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.216
Well, maybe it's the kind of honor
we could do without.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.650
Hey, honey,
what are you doing home?

15:54.053 --> 15:55.053
I got stood up.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.557
Well, that's despicable.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.159
Who is this knot-head?

16:00.192 --> 16:01.360
I'd rather not say.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.529
MARY: Well, sit down.
We just started.

16:03.562 --> 16:04.730
People are scared.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.598
They're building
bomb shelters to protect themselves

16:06.632 --> 16:09.034
from people like this man.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.235
I go to the store,

16:10.269 --> 16:13.572
people are buying
canned food and potassium tablets.

16:13.605 --> 16:16.408
It's all about this man
and what he represents.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.510
He's a threat to all of us.
A traitor.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.346
ROGER: Who's a traitor?
The Rosenbergs were traitors.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.280
Who were they?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.382
They gave atomic secrets
to the Russians.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.384
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.486
You can't accuse Abel
of being a traitor.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.054
He's not an American.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.456
(SOFTLY)
Oh, listen to yourself.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.124
You're defending him already.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.192
You're rehearsing it on me.

16:33.225 --> 16:35.227
You said you were
just thinking about taking it.

16:35.260 --> 16:38.130
I am just thinking about it,
just very hard.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.100
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.434
Jim, what do we deserve?

16:42.468 --> 16:44.403
Do you know how
people will look at us?

16:44.436 --> 16:46.605
The family of a man
trying to free a traitor?

16:46.638 --> 16:48.540
He's not a traitor, Mary.
Yes, yes.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.109
(PHONE RINGING)
Roger, get that! He's not a traitor...

16:50.142 --> 16:51.377
Why do I have to do
all the work?

16:51.410 --> 16:53.212
Oh! You wait till we say grace.
I'm hungry!

16:53.245 --> 16:54.613
He's about the most unpopular
man in this country,

16:54.646 --> 16:56.248
and you're trying
to take second place!

16:56.281 --> 16:57.683
Yeah, and I'm third.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.685
JAMES: Carol, you just dated the wrong guy.
I wanna eat.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.253
Mary, don't make
this an argument

17:01.286 --> 17:02.287
when we're not having
an argument.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.589
You're against him,
I'm for him?

17:03.622 --> 17:06.425
No, I'm not for him.
I'm not for the Russians spying on us.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.428
I'm for his right to have a defense
in a court of law,

17:09.461 --> 17:11.463
which is why they call it
a court of law.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.365
I didn't mean
to interrupt dinner.

17:13.398 --> 17:14.599
A court of law...
Hey, Doug.

17:14.633 --> 17:19.304
Oh, no, not at all.
Hello, Doug. Jim was just flailing.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.573
I'm not flailing.
Go ahead, Doug, you can join us for dinner.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.409
We're having
meatloaf tonight.

17:25.676 --> 17:28.213
So, you came over
to help Jim think about

17:28.247 --> 17:29.448
whether he's
taking the case?

17:29.481 --> 17:32.351
Oh, we're taking it!
It's exciting, isn't it?

17:34.253 --> 17:35.254
(SIGHS)

17:40.459 --> 17:42.194
Lord, we thank thee
for thy blessings

17:42.227 --> 17:43.629
we are about to receive.

17:43.662 --> 17:46.198
Thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.741
Good morning, sir.
My name is Jim Donovan.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.743
These are my credentials.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.212
I am a partner in
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.615
I was admitted to
the New York Bar in 1941.

18:03.649 --> 18:06.118
(DOOR BANGING)
(CHAIN RATTLING)

18:07.653 --> 18:11.523
You have been charged
with three counts and 19 overt acts.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.226
Conspiracy to transmit
United States defense

18:14.259 --> 18:15.761
and atomic secrets
to the Soviet Union,

18:15.794 --> 18:17.529
conspiracy to
gather secrets,

18:17.563 --> 18:19.698
and failing to register
as a foreign agent.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.739
Do many foreign
agents register?

18:32.778 --> 18:35.247
If you don't mind
my asking, sir,

18:36.548 --> 18:39.485
since your arrest,
where have you been?

18:43.222 --> 18:44.456
I couldn't say for certain.

18:46.825 --> 18:47.825
You don't know?

18:49.528 --> 18:51.396
They drove me to an airport

18:51.430 --> 18:53.565
and put me on a plane,
took me off the plane.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.236
Somewhere hot.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.471
It's hot here.

18:59.505 --> 19:02.441
Hotter, very humid.
(SNIFFLING)

19:02.474 --> 19:04.409
They put me in a room.

19:06.345 --> 19:07.646
Were you beaten?

19:08.480 --> 19:09.681
No.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.683
I was talked to.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.785
Offers were made.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.887
What do you mean?

19:14.920 --> 19:18.423
Offers of employment,
to work for your government.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.362
I was told if I cooperated,

19:23.395 --> 19:25.564
no further charges
would be made against me.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.400
And I would be given money.

19:29.735 --> 19:30.836
Hmm.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.437
And you declined?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.308
As you see.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.710
Well, of course
I can't endorse that.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.679
I feel duty-bound
to urge you

19:40.712 --> 19:42.814
to cooperate with
the U.S. government.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.249
Well, I said no.

19:44.283 --> 19:47.486
Perhaps you could relay
to your friends at the CIA that I meant it.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.521
No, no, no.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.490
I... I don't work
for the agency.

19:53.392 --> 19:55.460
I don't work
for the government.

19:55.494 --> 19:58.730
I am here to offer my services
as your legal counsel.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.600
If you accept them
as such,

20:02.768 --> 20:04.369
I work for you.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.838
If I accept you?

(SNIFFLES)

20:08.440 --> 20:09.575
(SWALLOWS)

20:13.478 --> 20:15.447
Are you good at what you do?

20:16.915 --> 20:19.484
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

20:21.920 --> 20:25.591
Have you represented
many accused spies?

20:26.858 --> 20:28.493
(INHALES)

20:28.527 --> 20:30.295
No, not yet.

20:31.763 --> 20:34.399
This will be a first
for the both of us.

20:36.668 --> 20:37.903
(LAUGHS)

20:37.936 --> 20:39.338
Yes.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.408
All right.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.876
JAMES: "All right"?
You accept?

20:47.512 --> 20:48.847
Yes, all right.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.383
Good, okay.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.551
Let's start here.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.719
If you are firm
in your resolve

20:53.752 --> 20:55.354
not to cooperate
with the U.S. government...

20:55.387 --> 20:56.488
I am.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.923
Yeah.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.791
Then do not talk
to anybody else about your case,

20:59.825 --> 21:01.526
inside of government or out.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.663
Except to me,
to the extent that you trust me.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.698
I have a mandate to serve you.
Nobody else does.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.500
Quite frankly,
everybody else has an interest

21:08.533 --> 21:09.973
in sending you
to the electric chair.

21:10.669 --> 21:11.669
All right.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.642
You don't seem alarmed.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.545
(MUMBLES)

21:21.980 --> 21:23.582
Would it help?

21:33.859 --> 21:37.929
I... I would like
materials to draw with.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.431
That's not possible.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.401
A pencil, a piece of paper.

21:42.434 --> 21:43.635
Cigarettes.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.606
Please?

21:55.013 --> 21:57.816
Mr. Donovan,
you have men like me

21:57.849 --> 22:00.419
doing the same
for your country.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.889
If they were caught,

22:03.922 --> 22:06.825
I'm sure that you would
wish them to be treated well.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.764
CIA AGENT: What's your name?

22:12.798 --> 22:14.433
Francis Gary Powers.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.470
CIA AGENT: Rank, service?

22:18.503 --> 22:20.706
First Lieutenant,
United States Air Force.

22:22.774 --> 22:24.476
Do you have any association

22:24.509 --> 22:26.511
with the Soviet Union,
Lieutenant Powers?

22:26.545 --> 22:27.746
Kidding?

22:27.779 --> 22:28.947
Just answer the questions,
Lieutenant.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.550
Yes, no,
or as simply as you can.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.752
Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union?

22:33.785 --> 22:35.487
Hell, no.

22:37.055 --> 22:38.490
Do you know
why you're here?

22:38.523 --> 22:39.691
POWERS: Mmm-mmm.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.794
Is that a no?

22:42.828 --> 22:45.030
Yes. I mean...

22:45.063 --> 22:46.932
No, it's just "no."

22:46.965 --> 22:49.501
Yes, I have absolutely
no idea why I'm here.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.702
Eyes front, Lieutenant.

22:50.736 --> 22:51.870
Yes, sir.

23:09.621 --> 23:10.856
How'd you do in there, Gary?

23:12.691 --> 23:15.594
Pretty good.
Think I got my name right.

23:15.627 --> 23:18.563

outscored Shinn, then.

23:20.031 --> 23:21.466

23:21.500 --> 23:22.734

23:22.768 --> 23:24.703
Oh. Well, deal me in.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.938
JOE: So, these are
all mine, then.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.807

not to play with him.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

23:55.834 --> 23:57.669
Okay, drivers,
here's the deal.

23:59.137 --> 24:01.006
You've been selected
for a mission

24:01.039 --> 24:02.574
which you are
not to discuss

24:02.607 --> 24:04.876
with anyone
outside of this room.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.645
No one.

24:06.678 --> 24:08.713
I don't care who you trust.

24:08.747 --> 24:10.715
Wife, mother, sweetheart.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.717
The good Lord
when you pray at night.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.686
You don't tell
any of them anything

24:14.719 --> 24:16.521
of what
I'm about to tell you.

24:19.024 --> 24:21.760
Each of you drivers has
met certain qualifications.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.830
High level
security clearance.

24:24.863 --> 24:26.631
Exceptional pilot ratings

24:26.665 --> 24:28.633
in excess of
the required hours flight time

24:28.667 --> 24:30.602
in a single-seat aircraft.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.605
We are engaged in a war.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.874
This war does not, for the moment,
involve men-at-arms.

24:35.907 --> 24:37.776
It involves information.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.011
You will be
collecting information.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.881
You will be gathering
intelligence about the enemy.

24:42.914 --> 24:46.551
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand

24:46.585 --> 24:49.120
in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.591
Or it could prevent one.

24:53.925 --> 24:56.127
For public purposes,

24:56.161 --> 24:57.929
as far as your wife or mother

24:57.963 --> 24:59.931
or sweetheart
or the good Lord above,

24:59.965 --> 25:01.967
your mission does not exist.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.836
If it does not exist,
you do not exist.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.973
You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

25:14.713 --> 25:16.047
You work for the CIA now.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.927
(DOOR CLOSES)

25:28.960 --> 25:32.797
So, Jim, I heard your guy is
speaking with a phony accent.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.901
Does he keep that up
all the time?

25:35.934 --> 25:38.670
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's just the way he talks.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.805
He's got the Russian name
but a British passport.

25:40.839 --> 25:43.742
Well, I doubt
that that's genuine.

25:43.775 --> 25:46.044
So, Jim, where are we?
I see here...

25:46.077 --> 25:48.680
Yes, uh, Judge, you see,

25:48.713 --> 25:53.084
I just don't think that three weeks
is going to do it, here.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.086
We... We got a massive amount
of evidence, as you know.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.187
You wanna postpone?

25:56.221 --> 25:57.389
Six weeks.

25:57.422 --> 26:00.892
I mean, there's just myself
and my associate, basically.

26:00.926 --> 26:02.127
Jim, is this serious?

26:02.160 --> 26:03.161
Sir?

26:06.231 --> 26:07.999
Is this serious?

26:08.033 --> 26:09.668
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.102
You can see
in the filing...

26:11.136 --> 26:13.972
Jim, this man is a Soviet spy.

26:14.005 --> 26:16.675
Allegedly.
Come on, Counselor!

26:18.243 --> 26:19.744

Of course, I salute you.

We all salute you for
taking on a thankless task.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.650

due process.

26:26.985 --> 26:28.119

a capable defense.

And, God willing,
he'll be convicted.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.127
Come on, Counselor.

26:36.161 --> 26:37.696
Let's not play games
with this.

26:37.729 --> 26:39.831
Not in my courtroom.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.049

28:41.386 --> 28:42.987
What?

28:57.302 --> 28:58.302
Yeah.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.371
I just wanted to chat.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.177
How's the case going?

29:06.211 --> 29:08.980
Case is going great.
Couldn't be better.

29:09.013 --> 29:10.081
Mmm-hmm.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.117
Has your guy talked?

29:16.454 --> 29:19.090
Excuse me.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.860
You met him. Has he talked?
Has he said anything yet?

29:24.129 --> 29:25.964
We're not having
this conversation.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.099
No, of course not.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.301
No, I mean,
we really are not having it.

29:30.335 --> 29:34.038
You're asking me to violate
attorney-client privilege.

29:34.072 --> 29:35.340
Oh, come on, Counselor.

29:35.373 --> 29:36.341
You know,
I wish people like you

29:36.374 --> 29:37.442
would quit saying
"Oh, come on, Counselor."

29:37.475 --> 29:39.344
I didn't like it the first
time it happened today.

29:39.377 --> 29:41.179
A judge said it to me twice.

29:41.212 --> 29:43.214
And the more I hear it,
the more I don't like it.

29:46.484 --> 29:49.087
Okay, well, listen,
I understand attorney-client privilege.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.323
I understand
all the legal gamesmanship.

29:52.357 --> 29:55.059
And I understand
that's how you make a living.

29:55.093 --> 29:57.962
But I'm talking to you
about something else.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.066
The security
of your country.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.236
And I'm sorry
if the way I put it offends you.

30:05.270 --> 30:08.940
But we need to know
what Abel is telling you.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.042
You understand me, Donovan?

30:11.075 --> 30:13.111
We need to know.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.913
Don't go "Boy Scout" on me.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.183
We don't have
a rule book, here.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.486
You're Agent Hoffman, yeah?

30:21.519 --> 30:23.388
Yeah.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.490

30:25.523 --> 30:26.958
Yeah, so?

We call it the Constitution

30:46.211 --> 30:48.179
and we agree to the rules,

30:48.213 --> 30:49.981
and that's what
makes us Americans.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.149
It's all that
makes us Americans

30:51.182 --> 30:52.250
so don't tell me
there's no rule book,

30:52.283 --> 30:54.886
and don't nod at me like that,
you son of a bitch.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.432
Do we need to
worry about you?

31:09.067 --> 31:11.903
Not if I'm left alone
to do my job.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.219
WILLIAMS:
From this moment forward

31:28.253 --> 31:30.989
you will not refer to the U-2
as a spy plane

31:31.022 --> 31:33.024
or reconnaissance aircraft.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.293
You will refer to it
as <i>"The Article."</i>

31:35.326 --> 31:38.463
<i>The Article</i>
has an 80-foot wingspan.

31:38.496 --> 31:44.002
It's powered by a single Pratt and Whitney
J57 P-37 engine.

31:44.035 --> 31:46.404
10,000 pounds of thrust

31:46.437 --> 31:50.475
and a maximum speed
of 430 miles an hour.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.243
She may not be quick,

31:52.277 --> 31:55.179
but at your cruising altitude
of 70,000 feet,

31:55.213 --> 31:57.015
nothing will
come close to you.

31:57.048 --> 31:58.182
POWERS: 70,000?

31:58.216 --> 32:01.185
The idea is the enemy doesn't
even know you're there.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.087
It looks kind of flimsy.

32:06.090 --> 32:10.094
Every extra pound of weight
costs a foot in altitude,

32:10.128 --> 32:11.963
and we need
to accommodate the cameras.

32:14.098 --> 32:18.069
That's a 4,500-millimeter
lens, times three.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.405
A pin-sharp
panoramic camera

32:20.438 --> 32:25.076
four times as powerful as any aerial
reconnaissance cameras we've ever used.

32:25.109 --> 32:28.313
You're gonna be taking
pictures, lots of pictures.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.615
At 70,000 feet,

32:30.648 --> 32:34.585

32:34.619 --> 32:36.354

32:36.387 --> 32:39.524

33:16.461 --> 33:18.296
BLASCO: Sir.

33:18.329 --> 33:23.334
There seems to be
a subsection to this list here.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.370
Well, most of this stuff
came from his studio,

33:25.403 --> 33:27.563
but the rest is from the
hotel room he was holed up in.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.207
Where we found him.

33:30.541 --> 33:32.643
The hotel room you searched?

33:32.677 --> 33:34.445
Well, yeah.

33:34.479 --> 33:36.547
Can I see the warrant?

33:36.581 --> 33:38.182
The what?

33:39.584 --> 33:42.153
Yeah, explain this to me.
There was a warrant.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.521
There was a warrant.

33:43.554 --> 33:45.623
A civil detention writ
for the arrest of an alien,

33:45.656 --> 33:47.525
but there was
no search warrant

33:47.558 --> 33:49.360
for suspicion
of criminal activity.

33:49.394 --> 33:50.628
So, the search
and the evidence

33:50.661 --> 33:52.397
that is
the fruit of that search,

33:52.430 --> 33:54.532
that's all tainted
and should not be admitted.

33:54.565 --> 33:57.301
What protections is he due,
Your Honor? The man is not...

33:57.335 --> 34:00.171
The man is what?
He's Rudolf Ivanovich Abel.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.106
He is a Soviet citizen.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.408
He's not an American.

34:03.441 --> 34:07.578
1886,
<i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins.</i>

34:07.612 --> 34:10.715
The court held that even aliens,
in that case Chinese immigrants,

34:10.748 --> 34:14.118
could not be held to answer for a crime
without due process of law,

34:14.152 --> 34:16.312
including any alien that entered
the country illegally.

I don't see how an alien,
if he's here illegally,

34:23.628 --> 34:26.496
how he suffered
deprivation of rights.

34:26.531 --> 34:28.331
Rights as what?

34:28.366 --> 34:30.201
An American?

34:30.234 --> 34:33.371
Rights as what, Counselor?

34:33.404 --> 34:35.206
We're in a battle
for civilization.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.443
This Russian spy came here
to threaten our way of life.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.545
Now, I have a courtroom
of people waiting.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.580

34:42.612 --> 34:44.748

you're not

this is really important.

36:31.622 --> 36:34.325
is cut off all the water

is keep this filled,

use the shower in your room,

36:37.862 --> 36:40.364
use the sink downstairs,
the garden hose outside...

36:40.398 --> 36:42.466
Those are good ideas.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.382
as being something
you ever have to worry about.

36:47.805 --> 36:49.073

there may not be enough time
to fill the tub and the sinks.

36:57.782 --> 36:58.816

36:58.849 --> 37:01.686
the Reds will aim
for the Empire State Building.

every time he came.

did he do
anything remarkable.

he got back to his feet.

It came up

in London.

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:28.817

fishing expedition.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.722
What kind of
fishing trip, Jim?

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:36.492
Salmon fishing.

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:38.565

not gonna be in any danger,

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:39.928
that this is
just a routine business trip,

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.664
and I won't worry.

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.666
I need my passport.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.472
Just give me something
to hold on to.

HOFFMAN: Mr. Michener, here,
is your Berlin escort.

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:23.839
He's an attache
with the U.S. embassy.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.475
So, it's gotten goddamn complicated.
JAMES: Uh-huh.

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:27.876
As you know,
the last letter from Mrs. Abel,

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:30.012
whoever she is, talks about
a lawyer in East Berlin,

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:32.514
Mr. Vogel, whoever he is,
representing her interests, she says.

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:33.916
Yeah, Vogel says

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:35.851
he's gone to the Russian
embassy in East Berlin

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:38.520
and they may be ready
to trade Abel for Powers.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.456
But no one knows who's who,

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:41.724
but essentially they're all Russian,
right?

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:44.560
Well, Soviet.
Well, we think so.

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.762

to throw you a curveball.

another prisoner other than Powers.

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:57.840
Another American?

01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:01.009
The, uh, East German Stasi
picked up an American student.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.244
Frederic Pryor.

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:04.847
Uh, the kid they found on the wrong
side of the Wall.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.648
He's a grad student
out of Yale.

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.717
Came over here to study economics.
JAMES: Mmm-hmm.

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:12.588
So, they're making noises
about trying this kid for espionage.

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:15.057
Grave offense, capital crime.
Well.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:19.828
Vogel got in touch with us,
said he represents Pryor.

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:24.800
Wait a minute. Vogel represents Mrs. Abel
and this... This kid?

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:26.502
Yeah, he's busy.

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:28.704
Well, so,
what is he?

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:31.073
Vogel, is he, uh,
East German or is he Russian?

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:33.776
Well, try to figure it out
when you meet him.

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:36.078
At Russian embassy,
East Berlin, noon tomorrow.

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:38.814
Hoffman will show you
how to get there.

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:40.916
Wait, show me how to get there?
I'm gonna have an escort.

01:13:40.949 --> 01:13:42.785
Right?

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:44.920
Well, that was the plan
but like I said, there's a wrinkle.

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:47.689
I won't be taking you.
Decision's been made.

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:50.492
No U.S. government personnel are to
cross the border until further notice.

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:51.827
How come?
It's too dangerous.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.695
Yeah, the East Germans
grabbed this kid.

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:57.666
There's a degree of impunity
that we had not anticipated.

01:13:57.699 --> 01:14:00.669
The point is that the East German agenda
and the Russian agenda

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:02.104
may not be
the same thing.

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.006
Try and figure it out
and act accordingly.

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.841
And try to make a deal.
Powers for Abel.

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:08.777
Well, what about this
college kid, Pryor?

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:11.613
Mmm-mmm.
Don't fall for that.

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:12.714
We can get him out
another time.

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:13.949
Powers is the whole
ball game.

01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:38.707
Where's your room?

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:40.868
I'll be staying
at the Hilton.

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:44.111
It's not far.

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:48.750
This is a number here
in West Berlin.

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:50.144
Memorize it and
give it back to me.

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.021
No, no. I...
I mean, now.

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.759
The Soviets keep cutting
the international lines

01:14:57.793 --> 01:15:00.028
but local calls
are okay.

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:01.897
Someone will pick up
day and night.

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:14.076
Now, this docket attached to your passport
will serve as your ticket

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:16.011
into and out of
the Eastern Soviet sector.

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:19.993
The meeting with Vogel
is set for noon tomorrow.

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.657
There are only a few routes
left to the East.

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.893
You take the S-Bahn, the station we showed
you on the way in.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:33.195
You're gonna get off
at the Friedrichstrasse station here

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:36.131
and walk to the Soviet embassy
on Unter den Linden here.

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:38.800
Look at the map now.
You shouldn't take it with you.

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:40.936
You're looking at a map,
you're an American, you're a spy.

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.971
You could
well be detained.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:45.073
Just avoid interacting
with people generally.

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:48.043
You don't...
You don't belong, so don't stick out.

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:50.178
Food is scarce over there
and things have started to fall apart.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.413
There are gangs,

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:54.716
and rule of law is less firmly
established over there.

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.752
And definitely stay away
from the Wall.

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:57.953
On their side,
there's a line

01:15:57.986 --> 01:15:59.021
cleared of buildings
along the Wall.

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.756
They call it
the "Death Line."

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:02.691
Cross it and
you'll be shot.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:05.060
Is there any outcome here
where I'm not either detained or shot?

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.696
Don't worry too much
about what Michener said.

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.765
No, I'm worried about
what you're saying.

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:11.800

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:13.235

how old is he?

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:15.671

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:47.933
that will be signed
when the exchange actually takes place.

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:50.618
This is the only
reason I'm here.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:53.421
I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:56.524
Abel for Francis
Gary Powers

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.195
and Frederic Pryor.

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.466
Mmm, we don't have Pryor.

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:06.468
No? You don't?

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.439
I've heard of Pryor,
but he's held

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:14.609
by the German
Democratic Republic,

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:17.479
not by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:21.382
Well, I'll tell you
the first problem.

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:24.419
The names of your countries
are too long. (CHUCKLES)

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:27.522
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, yes.

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:28.590
(SNIFFLES AND COUGHS)

01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:30.592
If we release Powers,

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:32.594
it is only to
promote a goodwill

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:33.761
between our countries.

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:38.166
So, it cannot be
an exchange.

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:42.604
Perhaps...

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:45.507
Perhaps you could
release Abel

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.475
as a token of goodwill
to our friends in Germany,

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:50.378
and then,
some months later,

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.814
we would release Powers.

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:55.283
There is an idea.
No. That just won't work for us at all.

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.619
See, we need this to be
an exchange.

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:59.420
You can call it
what you want,

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:01.289
but an exchange
it must be.

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:04.459
We can have Abel here
within 48 hours.

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:07.662
We need Powers
at the same time we give you Abel.

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:12.634
Hmm. This is...

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:16.571
Can we call this
the "impatient plan"?

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:18.439
Well, you can call it
whatever you want.

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:20.575
(EXHALES)

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:23.444
I can relay your
impatient plan to Moscow,

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:24.345
see what they say...
(COUGHING)

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:27.715
But they will wonder
why so impatient.

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:30.718
Because I have a cold.

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:32.672
And I don't live in Berlin
and I want to go home.

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:34.722
They will think,

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:37.592
"Well, the Americans
must have gotten

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:40.562
"all the information
that Abel had to give.

01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:44.399
"And now they're impatient
to trade him,

01:26:44.432 --> 01:26:47.468
"hoping to get in return
this man, Powers,

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:49.604
"that, perhaps,
has not yet given up

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.639
"all the information
that he has to give."

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:55.643
This is not
an equitable trade, sir.

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:58.546
But what you're saying is,

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.582
if Powers has given up
everything he knows,

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.850
then Moscow would trade?

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.452
Why wouldn't they?

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.656
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:11.359
the next Russian operative
who gets caught

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:13.428
might think twice about
keeping his mouth shut.

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:18.800
And you never know.
Abel might want to see the sky again

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:21.869
and decide to trade Russian
secrets for small American favors.

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:27.775
How can we know this?

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:31.479
We little men,
we just do our jobs.

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.848
Like Lieutenant Powers.
He's just a pilot.

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:40.521
He was making photographs
from 70,000 feet

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:41.715
when he was shot
from the sky.

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:44.759
People in my country
consider this

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.628
an act of war.

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:51.733
We have to get off this
merry-go-round, sir.

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.534
The next mistake
our countries make

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.336
could be the last one.

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:58.806
We need to have
the conversation

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.541
our governments can't.

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:08.516
I will ask Moscow.

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:10.518
Who knows
what they will say.

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:13.788
There are a lot of people,
Mr. Donovan,

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:17.925
who doesn't want this
exchange to ever take place.

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:24.399
Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:25.433
Powers for Abel.

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:26.934
And Frederic Pryor.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.469
As I said,

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.672
Pryor is in the hands
of the organs of

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:32.907
State Security of the German
Democratic Republic.

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.510
I'm confident you can
make arrangements.

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:37.845
I am merely a secretary

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:39.580
in the embassy
of foreign power.

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:40.948
Okay, okay.

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:44.585
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I'll give you his address.

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.554
There actually is
a Mr. Vogel?

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:48.856
Why would you
imagine otherwise?

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.792
Uh, it's a short cab ride.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:54.829
And please, Mr. Donovan,

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:56.698
wear an overcoat
in this weather.

01:28:58.499 --> 01:28:59.701
I had mine
stolen from me.

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.704
What do you expect?

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.572
It was from
Saks Fifth Avenue.

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:06.907
Wasn't it?

But the Soviets decided
not to host me.

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.435
Very irritating.

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:36.771
I am still trying
to grasp each party's...

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:39.507
Status?

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:42.643
Yes. And interest
in the proceedings.

Oh.

It's a new world.

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:47.782

isn't it?

what I have to offer.

Frederic Pryor,

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:22.717
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:25.820
But every accident,
properly viewed,

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:27.955
is an opportunity,
isn't it, Mr. Donovan?

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:30.958
Well...
Your country refuses to recognize

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:33.661
the German
Democratic Republic.

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:35.696
They prefer to
make up stories

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:37.330
that the GDR doesn't
exist, for instance.

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.736
Sorry.

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:44.105

government's recognition

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:46.674
of this real place, sir,

find yourself,

of my government.

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:03.857

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:09.030
I think that's childish,
Mr. Donovan.

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:11.699
Well, I... I have
no official status.

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.100
Fine.

Helen is the wife.

We will produce
Rudolf Abel.

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:43.564
You will produce,
at the same time, the student, Pryor.

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:45.600
At the same time?

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:47.068
Absolutely.

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:51.672
The exchange on offer
is a Russian at the end of his life

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:56.744
for an American student
at the start of his.

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:06.654
Schischkin? He's not
an embassy secretary.

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:09.657
Ivan Schischkin is the KGB's
chief in western Europe.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:10.992
(CLEARS THROAT)
Well, whatever he is,

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:13.928
he's relaying our
proposal to Moscow

and they'll decide.

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:19.734
Could I borrow a coat?
I lost mine.

lose your coat?

Him, we don't know.

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:35.917
He might be what you
said he said he is.

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:37.184
Friend of
the attorney general.

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:40.922
Just some guy the GDR
tapped to handle this.

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:42.857
Sounds like
the East Germans

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:45.626
are fighting for
a place at our table.

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.696
The GDR gets Abel back
for the Russians,

winning their respect...
(COUGHING)

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:52.700
And capturing the headlines
for their cause.

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:54.969
Which, of course,
puts East Germany on the map.

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:57.705
But we don't care
about their map.

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.206
Stick with
the Russians.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.842
Stick with the Russians.
It's Powers for Abel.

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:05.012
So, does all this mean
this might actually happen?

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.914
Yeah, that's what
you seem to be telling me.

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:09.984
We'll put Abel on a plane,
he'll be here Friday.

01:33:10.017 --> 01:33:12.019
So, if Schischkin
gets the okay,

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:14.221
all that's left is the
mechanics of the trade.

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.090
How we swap our guy
for their guy.

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:18.225
Our "guys." Two guys.

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.728
Powers and Pryor.

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:23.698
No, now don't go
bleeding heart on me.

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:25.933
Powers is the whole
ball game.

Ivy League boy,

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.870

it was a good idea

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:32.273
to study Soviet
economics in Berlin

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:34.008
in the middle
of the Cold War.

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.111
Powers is who we need.

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:39.947
You don't even
like Powers.

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:43.884
Everybody hates Powers.

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:48.122
He didn't kill himself and he let the
commies parade him on television.

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:50.691
He's the most
hated man in America.

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:53.227
After Rudolf Abel,
maybe.

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.929
And me.

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:05.006
Now wake up!

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:07.008

you can sleep

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.529
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:09.563 --> 01:46:10.764
One first or...

01:46:10.797 --> 01:46:12.499
Both first, both.
Whenever they're ready.

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:14.501
And coffee.
Hmm.

01:46:32.085 --> 01:46:33.854
You shouldn't be here.

01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:35.055
Well, sometimes
in Germany,

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:36.957
you just want a big
American breakfast.

01:46:41.027 --> 01:46:43.063
What happened?
Where were you last night?

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:46.066
Vogel arranged for me
to spend some time in the East.

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:47.667
Oh, Jesus.

01:46:47.701 --> 01:46:48.935
Frankly, it's not
that much worse

01:46:48.969 --> 01:46:50.804
than where you have me
here in the West.

01:46:52.873 --> 01:46:56.543
So the Russians are fine
with the exchange,

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:59.079
but now Vogel is saying
that the East Germans won't do it.

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:00.112
We're not gonna
get Pryor.

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:03.517
Great, good.

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:05.552
So the Soviets are set.
We get Powers.

01:47:05.585 --> 01:47:06.853
We get Powers.

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.889
Well done.

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.957
JAMES: No, the East Germans
won't do it.

01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:13.093
We won't get Pryor,
and that kid matters.

01:47:13.126 --> 01:47:14.828
Every person matters.

01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:17.898
Sure, that's why you tried.
That's why you tried.

01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:19.966
Abel's on his way,
so we're all set for tomorrow morning.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.569
Wait a minute.
Makes things simple. Makes things simple.

01:47:22.602 --> 01:47:24.871
We are not
getting the kid.

01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:27.040
Yeah, I understand.
We're set.

01:47:27.073 --> 01:47:28.873
We can ignore the message
we got this morning.

01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:31.912
What message?

01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:33.079
From the East Germans.

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:35.048
They called the number
I gave you.

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:37.584
They said they wanted
to speak to you today.

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:39.586
Vogel called?
No, um...

01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:41.955
Office of, uh,
Harald Ott,

01:47:41.988 --> 01:47:43.557
East German
attorney general.

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:45.058
Wanting what?
What does he want?

01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:46.193
Well, to talk to you.

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:49.129
But it's okay,
I can't ask you to go back there.

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:51.765
And listen, you seem to be
persona non grata to some elements,

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:53.099
so we won't
push our luck.

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:55.135
So he wants to see me.

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:57.103
What time?

01:47:57.137 --> 01:48:00.073
Oh, no, no. Now, listen.
(STUTTERING)

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:02.142
You don't need to go.
In fact, you shouldn't go.

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:04.611
In fact, you can't go.

01:48:04.644 --> 01:48:06.980
We're set with the Soviets.
We don't want to screw it up.

01:48:07.013 --> 01:48:08.949
I'm not gonna screw it up.
You're not going!

01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:10.550
Don't be a pain in the ass.

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:11.952
Oh, I ordered.

01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:14.054
Enjoy your big
American breakfast.

01:48:20.126 --> 01:48:21.126
(SIGHS)

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:25.732
I thought it should
be negotiated

01:48:25.765 --> 01:48:27.968
at the highest level
as a courtesy to you.

01:48:28.001 --> 01:48:29.803
I thank you, sir.

01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:34.908
I don't know how things
became so confused.

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:37.744
Well, I guess sometimes
they just do.

01:48:42.215 --> 01:48:43.817
For sake of clarity,

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:46.186
I say we are fully
prepared to exchange

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:50.924
the so-called student, Pryor,
for Rudolf Abel.

01:48:50.957 --> 01:48:53.793
I understand from Mr. Vogel
that Pryor is very important to you.

01:48:53.827 --> 01:48:55.195
JAMES: Yes, but...

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:57.797
Ah, we'll do a memorandum
to that effect.

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:01.101
Oh, a memorandum.

01:49:01.134 --> 01:49:04.604
Certainly, we commit
to a bi-lateral exchange.

01:49:06.139 --> 01:49:10.677
Yes, yes, sure. I'm not sure
what that means but...

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:15.081
My country also insists
on Francis Gary Powers.

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:16.182
No!

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:20.053
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

01:49:21.254 --> 01:49:24.925
This is how things
became so confused.

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:27.694
Powers. What use
is he, sir?

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:29.629
You want him back for
punitive reasons?

01:49:29.663 --> 01:49:30.864
What's done is done.

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:32.198
He has divulged
what he will divulge,

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:35.035
as no doubt
Abel has also.

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:39.839
We are offering instead
someone who you insist is innocent.

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:41.174
And this is right.

01:49:41.207 --> 01:49:42.842
This is who
you should retrieve.

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:44.911
The future.

01:49:44.945 --> 01:49:46.305
Look to the future.

I'm very sorry, sir.
The attorney general regrets

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:30.991
that he had to leave
on urgent business.

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:34.260
He left?
Yes. Many apologies.

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:36.696
I've been waiting
for over an hour.

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:38.064
Very sorry, sir.

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.801
Young man.

01:50:43.937 --> 01:50:45.038
Come here.

01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:48.241
It's all right.
Come here.

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.016
Uh...
Take a seat.

01:50:58.084 --> 01:51:00.053
Oh, come on, come on.
Sit down.

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:05.959
Do you like
your job here?

01:51:06.826 --> 01:51:08.194
It's a very
good job, sir.

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:10.330
It must be.
Must be interesting.

01:51:10.363 --> 01:51:11.798
Oh, yes, sir.

01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:13.933
And important, too.

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:16.936
And your English is...
Is good.

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:18.972
Yes, I hesitate to say
it's excellent.

01:51:19.005 --> 01:51:19.873
But it's excellent,
sir.

01:51:19.906 --> 01:51:21.941
Good, good.
Good.

01:51:21.975 --> 01:51:24.878
See, I just lost my
negotiating partner,

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:26.946
and I need
somebody to talk to,

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.915
and you seem like
a reasonable young man.

01:51:30.216 --> 01:51:31.851
Can I talk to you?

01:51:33.186 --> 01:51:34.186
Uh...

01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:36.256
It's all right.

01:51:36.289 --> 01:51:38.058
(CHUCKLES)
It's all right. I just...

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:42.228
I just need you to give
a message to your boss.

01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:46.358
But it has to be
very, very, very clear.

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:48.902
You understand?

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:53.306
Yes, sir. But perhaps
you should wait until he...

01:51:53.339 --> 01:51:56.810
No, no. The thing is,
I have this cold and I wanna get home

01:51:57.343 --> 01:51:59.212
and get in bed.

(BLOWS NOSE
AND CLEARS THROAT)

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.382
Can you give him
the message?

01:52:02.415 --> 01:52:03.817
Certainly.

01:52:05.819 --> 01:52:07.087
Well, this is
the message.

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:11.825
"There is no deal for
Abel unless we get Powers and Pryor."

01:52:13.359 --> 01:52:15.829
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:17.030
It's arranged for
tomorrow morning.

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:19.399
It will not happen
unless we get two men.

01:52:19.432 --> 01:52:21.134
Those two men.

01:52:21.167 --> 01:52:22.836
Two, two, two.
Yes, sir.

01:52:23.436 --> 01:52:26.206
If there is no deal,

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.874
your boss must tell
the Soviets.

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:31.144
He has to tell
the Soviets

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:33.213
that they are not
getting Rudolf Abel.

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:37.117
Yes, sir.

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:41.321
Oh, and tell him this.

01:52:43.089 --> 01:52:46.059
That so far, Abel has been
a good soldier,

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:48.161
but he thinks
he's going home.

01:52:48.194 --> 01:52:50.330
(COUGHS)

01:52:50.363 --> 01:52:52.966
If we had to tell him
that he's not going home,

01:52:52.999 --> 01:52:54.267
that the Soviets
don't even want him,

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.902
that he's never
going home...

01:52:55.935 --> 01:52:58.071
Well, I imagine his
behavior might change.

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:03.009
And who will be held
responsible for that?

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:06.846

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.081
That's a long message.

01:53:08.114 --> 01:53:10.150
Uh, did you get it all?

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:12.352
Yes, sir. Got it.
Good.

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.155
You're a good man.

01:53:16.222 --> 01:53:17.223
Oh...

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:19.859
And also tell him

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:21.060
there's no deal
unless we hear

01:53:21.094 --> 01:53:22.929
before the end of
business today.

01:53:22.962 --> 01:53:24.230
He has the number.

01:53:24.264 --> 01:53:26.266
If the exchange
isn't gonna happen,

01:53:26.299 --> 01:53:28.334
no reason for everybody
to get up first thing in the morning.

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:32.071

that would be pointless.

You're kidding me!

Not really.
I need some change.

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:39.379
This is exactly
what you weren't supposed to do.

01:53:39.412 --> 01:53:42.215
My instructions were
to feel out the situation.

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:45.051
Your instructions
were to get Powers, not Pryor.

01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:47.320
That was not the original deal.
You fouled it all up!

01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:49.989
How do you know?
I feel pretty good about it.

01:53:50.023 --> 01:53:51.391
You fucked it all up!

01:53:51.424 --> 01:53:53.226
Oh, don't worry.

01:53:53.259 --> 01:53:55.361
I think it's
gonna be fine.

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:57.130
How do you know?
You don't know that.

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:11.911
has been to feel me out.

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:14.247
Would I swap one for one
and which one?

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:17.283
But I said
"No, two for one."

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:19.252
So they know
where we stand.

01:54:19.285 --> 01:54:21.321
Yeah, what if they think
about it and say, uh...

01:54:21.354 --> 01:54:23.489
"Forget it! You keep our guy,
we keep your guys"?

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.528

fucked it all up.

if I have the time.

hi to Roger?

to the girls?

One wrinkle.
What is that?

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:10.530
They won't release
Pryor with Powers, not at the bridge.

01:56:10.563 --> 01:56:12.298
They'll release him
at the same time.

01:56:12.332 --> 01:56:14.434
When the Russians give us
Powers on the bridge,

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:17.103
they'll release Pryor
over Checkpoint Charlie.

01:56:17.136 --> 01:56:18.638
What does that mean?

01:56:18.671 --> 01:56:22.141
