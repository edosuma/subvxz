08:34.138 --> 08:37.265
IT'S BETTER THAT HE SPILLS SOME
LUDICROUS STORY ABOUT ALIENS

08:37.350 --> 08:38.726
THAN ABOUT THE YOU KNOW WHAT.

IT WASN'T THERE JUST NOW.

08:50.821 --> 08:54.242

MANAGED TO OPEN

08:54.325 --> 08:56.744
AND FIND WHAT WAS INSIDE IT,

08:56.827 --> 08:59.121
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN
THE NUMBERS.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.415
- SARAH'S NUMBERS.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.750
HE MIGHT HAVE.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.878

THAT PIECE.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.591
I THINK THESE DO.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.220

IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
PRETTY HORRIFYING.

- THE FACE IS.
THE BODY DEFINITELY IS NOT.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.987
- UH, WHERE'S HOT MARA GONE?

12:18.070 --> 12:21.157
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN REPLACED
BY A POTATO IN A CARDIGAN.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.825
- THAT IS SO LOW.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.245
SOMEBODY'S OBVIOUSLY TRYING
TO RUIN HER CHANCES.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.999
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

12:30.082 --> 12:30.666
- PROTECTION.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.334
- FROM AMELIA PINCHERS?

12:32.418 --> 12:35.838
- NO, ALIENS.
- OH.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.090
- IF IT WORKS
ON BRACE-FACE PINCHERS, GREAT.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.175
- OH, THAT EXPLAINS

12:39.258 --> 12:41.760
YOUR ALL-NIGHT SCI-FI MARATHON
LAST NIGHT.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.137
DUDE, YOU LOOK WRECKED.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.367
[door opens]

13:05.451 --> 13:08.370
- HELLO, SARAH.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.371
- TEARS OF GLASS.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.208
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

13:12.291 --> 13:15.044
- I PUT IT BACK.

13:15.127 --> 13:15.503
- PUT WHAT BACK?

13:15.586 --> 13:18.172
- IT'S SO ODD.

13:18.255 --> 13:22.635
TWO STEPS FORWARD,
THREE STEPS BACK!

13:25.346 --> 13:27.848
I LET DADDY DOWN.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.602
I COULDN'T FIND THEM.

13:31.685 --> 13:35.481
BUT YOU WILL, I KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE POWER.

13:35.564 --> 13:39.026
- WHAT'S THE POWER, SARAH?

13:39.109 --> 13:40.653
TELL ME ABOUT THE POWER.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.404
- I CAN HEAR IT, YOU KNOW.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.698
IT WHISPERS.

13:44.782 --> 13:48.744
- WHO WHISPERS, SARAH?
WHO WHISPERS?

13:48.827 --> 13:50.955
- THE HOUSE.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.418
- THERE WAS THIS TV SHOW
IN THE '80s

13:56.502 --> 14:03.092
ABOUT THESE LIZARD ALIENS WHO
HAD HUMAN SKIN AND ATE PEOPLE.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.928
I WAS UP ALL LAST NIGHT
WATCHING RERUNS.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.598
- NOW, THIS POEM IS
A PERSONAL FAVORITE OF MINE.

14:09.682 --> 14:15.271
LISTEN TO THE LANGUAGE,
THE SCALINESS OF THE WORDS.

14:15.354 --> 14:23.696
"A SNAKE CAME TO MY WATER TROUGH
ON A HOT, HOT DAY."

14:23.779 --> 14:26.865
- SEE, RANDOM REPTILE MENTION.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
I ALWAYS KNEW
THERE WAS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT

14:29.034 --> 14:30.119
ABOUT ANDREWS.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.454
- "HIS YELLOW-BROWN SLACKNESS

14:32.538 --> 14:34.790
SOFT-BELLIED DOWN
OVER THE EDGE."

14:34.873 --> 14:37.960
- SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ALIENS,
ISN'T SHE?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.461
LIZARD LADY.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.379
- [laughs]

14:40.462 --> 14:43.507
- "IN A SMALL CLEARNESS,

14:43.591 --> 14:49.013
"[echoing] HE SIPPED
WITH HIS STRAIGHT MOUTH.

14:49.096 --> 14:53.851
SOFTLY DRANK
THROUGH HIS STRAIGHT GUMS."

14:53.934 --> 14:55.311
- ALFIE, WAIT.
WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU?

14:55.394 --> 14:57.354
- SHOW YOURSELF, LIZARD LADY.
- ALFIE!

14:57.438 --> 14:58.397
[all screaming]

14:58.480 --> 14:59.481
- ALFIE!

14:59.565 --> 15:02.234
- ALFIE LEWIS, GET OFF!

15:02.318 --> 15:05.404
- YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW
THE VOICE WITHIN.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.824
TRUST IT.
LISTEN TO IT.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.660
- IS THAT WHAT
"FOLLOW THE VOICE" MEANS?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.329
- THE HOUSE KNOWS.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.333
- YOU ONCE TOLD ME
THAT THE HOUSE WAS EVIL.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.251
- OH, YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.502
IT'S THE GUARDIAN WHO'S EVIL.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.672
- WHO'S THE GUARDIAN?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.007
[gasps]

15:25.090 --> 15:27.051
VICTOR.

15:27.134 --> 15:27.676
- THEY TRICKED ME.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.679
THEY BOTH TRICKED ME.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.806
I THOUGHT THEY LIKED ME.

15:32.890 --> 15:37.061
ALL THEY WANTED WAS THE SECRET.

15:37.144 --> 15:42.358
WELL, I WOULDN'T TELL THEM.

15:42.441 --> 15:46.278
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE FOREVER.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.198
[moaning]

15:52.534 --> 15:54.536
- MICK, YOU'RE BACK.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.664
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING YOU
TILL THIS EVENING.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.874
DID YOU GET THE SCHOLARSHIP?

15:58.957 --> 16:00.501
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.087
PROBABLY WON'T KNOW
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.713
IS MARA AROUND?

16:04.797 --> 16:07.174
- I THOUGHT YOU AND MARA
WERE, LIKE, OVER,

16:07.257 --> 16:08.050
FINISHED, DONE, SAYONARA.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.803
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ME AND MARA ARE.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.471
IT'S COMPLICATED.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.389
IT WAS NEVER LIKE THAT
WITH ME AND YOU, WAS IT?

16:13.472 --> 16:15.224
- NO, IT WASN'T.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.936
IT WAS REALLY EASY
AND SUPER FUN MOST OF THE TIME,

16:19.019 --> 16:21.939
AND WE LOOKED SO GOOD
IN PHOTOS TOGETHER.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.607
- YEAH, I KNOW.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.609
I MISS THAT SOMETIMES.
- YOU DO?

16:25.693 --> 16:28.445
- ANYWAY, I BEST GO
AND SAY HELLO, I THINK.

16:28.529 --> 16:28.987
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER,
AMBS, YEAH?

16:31.198 --> 16:33.909
- AMBER, HAVE YOU SEEN FABIAN?

16:33.992 --> 16:35.911
- GET THIS, MICK'S BACK,
AND HE SERIOUSLY MISSED ME.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.413
I MEAN, WHY WOULDN'T HE?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.998
I GIVE IT 24 HOURS,
AND I BET WE'RE BACK ON.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.084
THANKS FOR LISTENING.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.715
- NOW, WHO WOULD PUT UP
A PICTURE OF YOU

16:47.798 --> 16:48.882
LOOKING SO TERRIBLE?

16:48.966 --> 16:50.259
IT'S BASICALLY SABOTAGE.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.971
- I DID THOSE.
- OH. SORRY.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.180
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT BAD...

16:55.264 --> 16:59.393
IF YOU SQUINT YOUR EYES...
AND THEN SHUT THEM.

16:59.476 --> 17:03.355
- IT'S OKAY.
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

17:03.439 --> 17:05.733
- [gasps]

17:05.816 --> 17:08.193
- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE YOU FLY-POSTING THESE.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.945
- CREDIT ME WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF TASTE, MARA,

17:11.029 --> 17:12.614
AND BETTER
GRAPHIC DESIGN SKILLS.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.700
THIS IS SO CLEARLY
NOT YOUR BODY.

17:14.782 --> 17:15.951
- OKAY, THANKS.
WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.493
- LET'S MOVE ON TO POLICIES,
SHALL WE?

17:17.578 --> 17:20.372
- UM...HI.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.332
- MICK.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.424
- TRIXIE, A BIT TIGHT
ON THE COLLAR.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.427
- ALFIE, WE HAVEN'T BEEN
ENTIRELY HONEST WITH YOU.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.345
- OH, NO.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.555
OH, I SHOULD HAVE
SEEN THIS COMING.

17:36.638 --> 17:40.142
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS IN
THE FILMS, AND I DIDN'T SEE IT.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.310
YOU'RE THE ALIENS.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.061
OH, HOW COULD I
HAVE BEEN SO BLIND?

17:43.145 --> 17:47.066
- WE'RE NOT ALIENS, ALFIE.
THERE AREN'T ANY ALIENS.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.526
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT AN ALIEN WOULD SAY.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.237
- WE JUST MADE IT UP
TO GET YOU OFF OUR BACKS.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.781
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE ALIEN ARTIFACTS?

17:53.864 --> 17:56.241
- THEY'RE PUZZLE PIECES.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.204
THEY LEAD TO SOME KIND OF RELIC
OR TREASURE.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.246
- TREASURE?

18:01.330 --> 18:04.958
IS IT ALIEN-RELATED,
AND HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?

18:39.868 --> 18:43.205
- AND I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.581
- REALLY?

18:44.665 --> 18:45.707
- I SWEAR.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.584
I NEVER STOPPED
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

18:47.668 --> 18:51.547
- THAT IS ONE OF THE SWEETEST
THINGS YOU'VE EVER SAID.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.131
- THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST
NAUSEATING THINGS

18:53.215 --> 18:53.465
YOU'VE EVER SAID.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.634
- AMBER.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.678
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
AND MARA WERE TOO COMPLICATED.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.721
- WHAT?
NO, I DON'T--

18:59.805 --> 19:00.639
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU MISS WHAT YOU AND ME HAD,

19:00.722 --> 19:03.225
EASY, FUN, PHOTOGENIC.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.434
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.854
- WELL, NO, I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY MEAN THAT--

19:06.937 --> 19:09.106
- YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE, MICK.

19:09.189 --> 19:09.815
[scoffs]

19:09.898 --> 19:12.818
- HAVE I MISSED SOMETHING?

19:12.901 --> 19:15.362
- NOTHING.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.155
FORGET HER.

19:17.239 --> 19:21.451
MARA, I NEED TO KNOW...

19:21.535 --> 19:23.829
WILL YOU...GO OUT WITH ME?

19:26.206 --> 19:27.374
- YES.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.107
- I'M HERE.

19:52.190 --> 19:55.319
SARAH SAID I SHOULD
LISTEN TO THE VOICE.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.036
HELLO?

20:04.119 --> 20:05.579
HOUSE?

20:05.662 --> 20:07.623
IT'S NINA.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.125
SO COME ON,
WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO FIND?

20:10.208 --> 20:12.211
[wind rushing]

20:15.172 --> 20:17.090
NO WAY.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.477
"BOARDING SCHOOL FOUNDED
ON ANUBIS ESTATE.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.981
