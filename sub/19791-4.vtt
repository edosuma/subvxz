WEBVTT

00:01.503 --> 00:05.999
Let me see your shoes. Ohhh,
there you go, you got it.

00:06.099 --> 00:08.467
Now, you just need to learn how
to be twice as good at everything

00:08.501 --> 00:11.136
for half the pay, and you
are on your way to womanhood.

00:12.472 --> 00:14.840
Oh, here you are.

00:14.874 --> 00:17.014
Wow! You guys look great.

00:17.114 --> 00:19.049
Oh, crap. Am I supposed
to look great, too?

00:19.083 --> 00:21.251
I can be ready for whatever I'm
not ready for in two minutes.

00:21.285 --> 00:24.120
Danny, Danny! This pregnant
girl is not going anywhere.

00:24.155 --> 00:27.257
We were just playing dress-up
because this might be my last month

00:27.291 --> 00:29.894
to wear any of my clothes
without them exploding.

00:29.994 --> 00:31.828
Sweetie, you look great.

00:31.863 --> 00:34.631
Remember, I fell in love
with you when you were chunky.

00:34.665 --> 00:36.196
Hon, I'm gonna fall out of love with

00:36.222 --> 00:37.793
you if you ever call me chunky again.

00:41.807 --> 00:45.910
I don't know how... but this can
be my fault if you want it to be.

00:45.944 --> 00:48.345
Thanks. I'd like that very much.

01:03.895 --> 01:05.830
...And that's when Brad and I realized,

01:05.864 --> 01:08.532
"harder" is a horrible safe word.

01:13.805 --> 01:16.073
God, I miss drinking coffee alone.

01:17.976 --> 01:19.643
Oh, my God, you guys, guess what?

01:19.678 --> 01:20.811
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:20.846 --> 01:22.213
I don't care.

01:22.247 --> 01:24.415
Well, I don't care that you don't care,

01:24.449 --> 01:26.065
because I have just been nominated

01:26.165 --> 01:27.899
for a New York Entertainment Award!

01:27.934 --> 01:28.967
Oh, yeah!

01:34.474 --> 01:36.341
Get off, this is my happy dance!

01:36.375 --> 01:38.143
Mine!

01:38.177 --> 01:40.114
Did you get nominated
for watching television?

01:40.214 --> 01:42.515
'Cause that's all you've
done for the last month.

01:42.550 --> 01:44.250
No, I got nominated

01:44.285 --> 01:45.652
for the critically acclaimed

01:45.686 --> 01:46.820
Mother's Day special

01:46.854 --> 01:48.788
<i>I produced for The Mary Hart Show,</i>

01:48.823 --> 01:50.223
right before that ungrateful wig

01:50.257 --> 01:52.892
in spandex fired me.

01:52.927 --> 01:54.361
Who's laughin' now?

01:54.395 --> 01:55.895
Probably still her,

01:55.930 --> 01:57.063
since she's rich and powerful,

01:57.098 --> 01:59.567
and you've had macaroni
for three straight meals.

01:59.667 --> 02:00.867
Yeah, yeah-yeah... yeah,

02:00.901 --> 02:02.502
whatever, man, she could
laugh all she wants,

02:02.536 --> 02:03.703
because once the news gets out

02:03.738 --> 02:04.971
that I was nominated,

02:05.006 --> 02:07.273
the job offers, they're
just gonna start flyin' in.

02:07.308 --> 02:09.342
People will literally be all over me.

02:09.377 --> 02:12.145
Oh, my God, Tucker, we
are gonna have so much fun!

02:12.179 --> 02:14.314
First of all, you are not invited,

02:14.348 --> 02:16.850
and second of all, I think
I just lost my gum in there.

02:16.884 --> 02:18.485
What, again?

02:18.519 --> 02:20.020
Hey, here's a little thought-ski...

02:20.054 --> 02:21.688
since you're nominated
for a Mother's Day special,

02:21.722 --> 02:23.890
why don't you invite your mom?

02:23.924 --> 02:26.226
My mom?

02:26.260 --> 02:29.529
If she had any human parts
that registered emotion,

02:29.563 --> 02:31.731
I'd say yes, but I
pretty much struck out

02:31.766 --> 02:33.733
in the warm and loving
parents department.

02:33.768 --> 02:37.070
Oh. Well not everybody
can be as lucky as Ben.

02:39.173 --> 02:40.607
You never know, man.

02:40.641 --> 02:42.809
This is important.
It's your first award.

02:42.843 --> 02:45.011
I guess I can call her.

02:45.046 --> 02:46.112
Hey, but can I borrow your phone,

02:46.147 --> 02:48.982
'cause she doesn't pick up when I call.

02:49.016 --> 02:51.117
Thanks, man.

02:51.152 --> 02:54.187
Oh! "Why don't you call your mom?"

02:54.221 --> 02:56.856
Why don't you invite
your mouth to shut up?

02:58.025 --> 02:59.789
God, I miss drinking coffee alone.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.997
How did this happen?

03:04.032 --> 03:07.367
Well... I think it started
with you takin' off my shirt,

03:07.402 --> 03:09.036
and then I took off your shirt...

03:09.070 --> 03:10.837
No...

03:12.340 --> 03:15.275
this. I mean, how... how
am I this big already?

03:15.310 --> 03:18.064
Honey, you look adorable,
you finally popped.

03:18.164 --> 03:20.331
Huh, yeah, I popped all
right, you wanna know why?

03:20.366 --> 03:22.427
Because a giant impregnated me.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.607
A giant who I love very much.

03:28.641 --> 03:30.845
But everyone at work is
gonna know that I'm pregnant.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.012
You haven't told them yet?

03:32.046 --> 03:34.447
Are you ashamed of our baby?

03:34.482 --> 03:36.149
Shouldn't you see it first?

03:37.351 --> 03:39.552
No, well, no one at work
knows, because if they find out,

03:39.587 --> 03:41.354
they'll never make me junior partner.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.256
You know, they won't
see a brilliant lawyer,

03:43.291 --> 03:45.458
they'll see a flabby
bundle of maternity leave.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.803
I was really hoping they
would've made a decision by now.

03:48.029 --> 03:49.896
Well, then you need to make them decide.

03:49.931 --> 03:51.960
Go in there and refuse to
take no for an answer...

03:52.100 --> 03:54.468
like I do.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.184
For the last time, we are
not naming our kid Maverick.

03:58.540 --> 03:59.908
- But you know what, you're right.
- You're right.

04:00.008 --> 04:01.242
I'm going to make it happen.

04:01.276 --> 04:02.777
Thank you.

04:03.466 --> 04:04.967
Oh, uh, don't forget your lunch.

04:05.001 --> 04:07.219
No salsa, carrots or cole slaw involved.

04:07.319 --> 04:09.253
I got a pregnancy barf list goin'.

04:10.555 --> 04:13.523
Oh, my God... oh God, you might
wanna add tuna to that list!

04:13.892 --> 04:16.060
- This could be my fault, too.
- It is!

04:19.064 --> 04:19.886
No, I... I get it, Mom.

04:19.986 --> 04:22.888
Yeah. Y... You're a doctor, you're busy.

04:23.957 --> 04:26.925
Yes, we can count this
as my birthday call.

04:30.096 --> 04:31.530
Seriously, what kind
of mother doesn't wanna

04:31.564 --> 04:33.239
be part of one of their
son's proudest moments?

04:33.339 --> 04:35.807
Ucch! Let it go! Okay?

04:35.841 --> 04:39.077
Nobody thought you were gonna
graduate, so I made plans.

04:40.245 --> 04:42.246
Not me, Tucker!

04:42.281 --> 04:43.735
And you were at my graduation.

04:43.835 --> 04:46.036
I think you might have
a drinking problem.

04:48.606 --> 04:50.474
Okay, Mom. Yeah, no, it's... it's fine.

04:50.508 --> 04:51.875
I'll talk to you later.

04:54.412 --> 04:56.180
Hey, Tuck. How'd it go?

04:56.214 --> 04:58.115
Why do I ever listen to you?

04:58.149 --> 05:00.084
That good, huh?

05:00.118 --> 05:01.852
No, Ben, not good.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.287
She's not coming.

05:05.690 --> 05:08.092
- This is all my fault.
- Yeah, we all got that.

05:09.161 --> 05:10.962
I just feel so bad for him.

05:10.996 --> 05:12.797
Me, too.

05:12.831 --> 05:16.500
Ahh... that's what this feeling is.

05:16.535 --> 05:17.935
Compassion.

05:19.271 --> 05:20.938
Mm, I don't like it!

05:22.074 --> 05:23.374
I need a drink.

05:26.746 --> 05:32.384
And I wanna see you all at the
sexual harassment seminar on Monday.

05:32.418 --> 05:34.185
Especially you, Janice.

05:35.721 --> 05:37.155
Dismissed.

05:39.191 --> 05:42.283
Whoa, whoa, Perrin. What are you
on, some kinda doughnut cleanse?

05:43.662 --> 05:44.416
No. I'm just...

05:44.442 --> 05:46.824
Calm down, I'm not callin'
you fat, I'm just suggesting

05:46.924 --> 05:48.925
you slow it down a bit,
'cause if you choke,

05:48.960 --> 05:52.363
HR has forbidden me from
administering the Heimlich.

05:52.463 --> 05:55.065
I still think shirts
off is more effective.

05:56.601 --> 05:59.603
Right, um... actually,
I wanted to talk to you

05:59.637 --> 06:01.671
about announcing the new junior partner?

06:01.706 --> 06:03.740
Those of us in the running
have been jumping through hoops

06:03.775 --> 06:05.431
for months, and I think
we deserve to know.

06:05.510 --> 06:08.345
Wow, feisty pants, you
wanna re-aim that angry gun?

06:08.379 --> 06:09.513
Huh?

06:11.082 --> 06:13.250
But you do have a point.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.819
- Thank you.
- So here's what we're gonna do.

06:14.853 --> 06:16.787
I'm gonna have everyone
stay late tomorrow,

06:16.822 --> 06:19.650
so you can present the closing
arguments to the McDougal case,

06:19.750 --> 06:21.551
and if we're suitably impressed,

06:21.585 --> 06:24.587
well, I think we'll be
able to make a decision.

06:24.622 --> 06:27.657
Uh, wow! Uh, tomorrow,
as in the day after today?

06:27.692 --> 06:29.325
I'm sorry, you said the MacDonald case?

06:33.831 --> 06:36.933
Oh... Oh, so prepared, I mean, I
could do it right now, if you wanted.

06:36.968 --> 06:38.564
But let's not, because you look busy.

06:38.664 --> 06:42.400
So, uh, tomorrow's
fine. Or... next week?

06:42.434 --> 06:43.902
Whichever.

06:48.674 --> 06:50.642
Hi! Tucker Dobbs.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.577
Probably takin' home
an award tomorrow night.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.447
Hey... Hey, Frank Bostwick, right?

06:55.481 --> 06:56.715
Did I just hear you were in the market

06:56.749 --> 06:59.161
for a hot young producer,
perfect, I'll call Monday!

06:59.953 --> 07:03.822
Tucker Dobbs? I've heard some
very impressive things about you.

07:03.857 --> 07:08.761
Really? Impressive enough to hire me?

07:08.795 --> 07:10.934
I'm not desperate, I'm just asking.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.400
Well, all I can say is,
your mother is hysterical.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.769
My what?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.937
Hello, son.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.472
What the hell are you doing here?

07:19.506 --> 07:23.409
I told you, you are not my plus one,
y... you're not even my minus one.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.409
Ben felt bad about your
mother not loving you enough

07:25.509 --> 07:27.911
to show up, so here I am.

07:27.945 --> 07:30.680
Not loving you enough,
but... showing up.

07:30.714 --> 07:33.249
Okay.  Right, right. Well, I suggest

07:33.284 --> 07:35.831
you finish filling up on shrimp
and get the hell outta here.

07:35.931 --> 07:38.065
Seriously, I can see them in your purse.

07:38.099 --> 07:40.100
Is that any way to treat
the woman who just talked up

07:40.135 --> 07:42.703
her talented, driven, bi-racial son,

07:42.737 --> 07:44.947
and got him three job interviews?

07:47.109 --> 07:49.210
Hey, you look important,
have you met my mom?

07:49.244 --> 07:50.962
Oh, hey...

07:52.681 --> 07:55.361
Dr. Dobbs! I'm so
happy you could make it.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.443
Tucker is gonna be so surprised.

08:03.005 --> 08:04.773
So, I bet you're pretty
proud of your son.

08:04.807 --> 08:06.441
Oh, of course I am.

08:06.475 --> 08:09.311
Makutawatah will be a
brilliant doctor one day.

08:09.345 --> 08:12.914
And to think, he only cost me $29
a month and a couple of stamps.

08:13.650 --> 08:14.750
I meant Tucker.

08:14.784 --> 08:17.653
Oh, Tucker could never be a doctor.

08:17.687 --> 08:20.989
Well, we certainly pulled that off,

08:21.024 --> 08:22.644
didn't we... son?

08:22.826 --> 08:24.093
Well, the awards are tomorrow night,

08:24.127 --> 08:26.829
so be sure to pull
it off again... "Mom"!

08:26.863 --> 08:30.933
- You're grounded!
- Not again, Ma!

08:30.967 --> 08:33.058
You know, I'm kinda sorry
your mom didn't come.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.359
I'd like to meet her someday.

08:34.394 --> 08:36.861
You slept with my dad and
were named in their divorce.

08:36.895 --> 08:39.431
And that's why I said, "kinda sorry."

08:39.466 --> 08:40.832
Okay.

08:42.102 --> 08:44.303
Thanks for coming, that was
super fun, I'm really tired, bye!

08:46.940 --> 08:49.541
Why do so many of my dates end this way?

08:52.679 --> 08:53.779
Mmm.

08:55.015 --> 08:58.884
Mom! Wha... What a surprise!

08:58.919 --> 08:59.526
Oh, my God!

08:59.626 --> 09:02.428
Oh... okay, I'd like to be done now.

09:02.462 --> 09:05.264
Okay. Um... what are you doing here?

09:05.298 --> 09:06.999
Guilty!

09:07.034 --> 09:08.834
Well, after we spoke, Benjamin called

09:08.869 --> 09:09.371
and explained to me

09:09.471 --> 09:11.305
how important this
award thing is to you.

09:11.339 --> 09:13.541
You didn't get that
from my call when I said

09:13.575 --> 09:15.643
how important this award thing is to me?

09:16.912 --> 09:19.680
Well, you think everything is important.

09:19.714 --> 09:21.315
Lord knows I've left the operating room

09:21.349 --> 09:24.685
for a couple of backyard plays that
turned out to be not as critical

09:24.719 --> 09:26.220
as my patients.

09:28.090 --> 09:30.057
Ben, can I talk to you for a minute?

09:30.092 --> 09:32.426
Mom, just, uh... m...
make yourself comfortable.

09:32.461 --> 09:34.328
Oh, I haven't been
comfortable in 26 years.

09:35.397 --> 09:37.098
Hey, aren't you 26?

09:39.234 --> 09:41.602
Hey, man, no need to get all mushy.

09:41.637 --> 09:43.171
A simple "thank you" is fine.

09:43.205 --> 09:44.639
You're right, this
really calls for a hug.

09:44.673 --> 09:46.175
Get off of me!

09:46.275 --> 09:48.843
Why would you send your
mom to be my pretend mom,

09:48.878 --> 09:51.066
while you call my mom to
come and be my real mom?

09:51.166 --> 09:53.200
Wait! Did my mom show
up at the cocktail party?

09:53.235 --> 09:55.269
That was not the plan!

09:55.303 --> 09:56.937
Well, let's just hope
she didn't talk to anyone.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.939
She talked to everyone!

09:58.974 --> 10:00.713
The whole world thinks she's my mom.

10:00.842 --> 10:04.111
I have six interviews and
a bachelor party to go to.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.847
But your mom's gonna be crushed
if she doesn't get to go now.

10:06.882 --> 10:09.317
Yeah. That's kinda why I'm so pissed!

10:09.351 --> 10:12.486
Oh... yeah, I was wondering.

10:12.521 --> 10:15.194
Look, man, I know you don't have
the best relationship with your mom,

10:15.190 --> 10:18.893
and I envy you for that. But
this could be the fresh start.

10:18.928 --> 10:20.019
What am I supposed to do?

10:20.162 --> 10:21.443
I don't think you have a choice.

10:21.543 --> 10:22.610
You have to uninvite her.

10:22.644 --> 10:26.261
Me? Wh-Why do I have to
do it? This is your fault.

10:26.514 --> 10:28.482
Is it?

10:28.516 --> 10:29.395
Yeah.

10:29.495 --> 10:30.862
Are you sure?

10:30.896 --> 10:32.864
Uh-huh.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.298
I don't know...

10:35.501 --> 10:40.205
And so, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury...

10:40.239 --> 10:46.845
Um... to ignore the facts
is to, um... is to...

10:51.417 --> 10:54.116
Poor thing, she's exhausted. She
didn't sleep at all last night.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.704
She's goin' down!

10:58.441 --> 10:59.630
Think I should wake her up?

10:59.656 --> 11:01.768
If you wake her up,
I'll put you to sleep.

11:03.846 --> 11:05.280
This is really important for her.

11:05.314 --> 11:08.083
Yeah, well, so was going to
that awards show with Tucker.

11:08.117 --> 11:10.039
But you don't see me
plotting my revenge.

11:10.353 --> 11:12.321
You don't, do you?

11:12.355 --> 11:14.223
'Cause I want it to
seem like an accident.

11:16.025 --> 11:18.660
It's McDougal, not
MacDonald, stupid, stupid.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.398
She's so beautiful when she sleeps.

11:23.967 --> 11:26.088
Is it wrong that all I wanna do is draw

11:26.114 --> 11:28.128
a mustache on her and post it online?

11:29.339 --> 11:30.372
Mom!

11:31.708 --> 11:33.568
- Okay, maybe just one picture.
- Okay!

11:36.547 --> 11:39.015
So, what'd you think of Uncle
Tucker's Mother's Day special?

11:39.049 --> 11:42.518
- Eh.
- Took the "eh" right outta my mouth.

11:42.553 --> 11:45.489
Finally, a suit named for
the guy who's wearin' it.

11:45.589 --> 11:47.657
The "tux"!

11:47.691 --> 11:48.825
What do you think, Emma?

11:48.859 --> 11:50.960
Handsome.

11:50.995 --> 11:53.486
And I agree! I should be
takin' you to the awards

11:53.586 --> 11:54.788
instead of your grandma.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.055
Emma's grandma? My mom?

11:57.090 --> 11:58.991
You're taking my mom?
Don't you mean your mom?

11:59.025 --> 12:01.627
No, your mom, like we planned.

12:01.661 --> 12:05.206
No! I uninvited my mom so
you could take your mom.

12:05.306 --> 12:06.539
Like we planned!

12:06.574 --> 12:10.644
No! I uninvited my mom so
that I could take your mom...

12:10.678 --> 12:11.778
like we planned!

12:11.812 --> 12:14.347
- I didn't plan that!
- That's pretty obvious now!

12:17.085 --> 12:19.486
- Should I stay out of it?
- Yes.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.317
- Will I stay out of it?
- No.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.785
Oh, you know me so well.

12:29.158 --> 12:31.121
You know, Tucker, the way your
mother's been singing your praises,

12:31.221 --> 12:32.588
you might just have
to pay her 10 percent.

12:35.725 --> 12:39.561
- Never happening, no.
- Oh, we'll see.

12:39.596 --> 12:41.096
I need a drink.

12:42.999 --> 12:46.535
So... you look like you
have an expense account.

12:46.569 --> 12:47.897
How liberal can you get with that thing?

12:49.139 --> 12:51.373
A vodka tonic, hold the tonic.

12:51.407 --> 12:54.472
Just like your father used to
drink before he would get Frisky.

12:55.011 --> 12:55.585
Mom?

12:55.611 --> 12:57.880
Why he had to have a drink
before he brought the cat in,

12:57.914 --> 12:59.014
I'll never know.

13:02.965 --> 13:04.860
I can't believe you
brought my mother here.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.184
Well, I'm sorry. How
was I supposed to know

13:06.284 --> 13:07.718
you were gonna reinvite my mom?

13:07.752 --> 13:10.821
The same way I was supposed to know
you would stay out of my business.

13:10.855 --> 13:13.324
Well, a better friend would
know I have no self-control.

13:14.359 --> 13:15.359
What do we do now?

13:15.393 --> 13:16.994
Oh... Oh, I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

13:17.028 --> 13:18.729
You're gonna go keep my mom occupied.

13:18.763 --> 13:21.041
Dude, she's an attractive
woman, but I d...

13:21.067 --> 13:22.232
By talking to her!

13:22.267 --> 13:24.326
Ohh, yeah, okay, I can do that, too.

13:24.426 --> 13:26.789
Look, I told her that because
her visit was a "surprise,"

13:26.889 --> 13:29.357
there wasn't enough time to
get her a ticket at my table.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.260
So, the two of you, you're just
gonna sit in the back together,

13:32.294 --> 13:34.855
and then I'll slip out with her
afterwards and take her to dinner.

13:34.955 --> 13:38.091
I like it, I like it, but
do you have another plan

13:38.125 --> 13:39.859
where I'm not stuck with
the my mom at the end?

13:39.893 --> 13:41.494
Oh, no. Incoming mom! Incoming mom!

13:41.528 --> 13:43.129
- Mine or yours?
- Both! Go! Go!

13:45.499 --> 13:47.300
All right, are we all ready to do this?

13:47.334 --> 13:51.671
I want everyone to give Ms. Perrin
here their undivided attention.

13:55.476 --> 13:58.006
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, before

13:58.032 --> 14:00.190
you sits not just an innocent man,

14:00.265 --> 14:03.139
but a man willfully and wrongly accused.

14:03.239 --> 14:06.408
We have shown... uh...
uh... ho... Is that tuna?

14:06.442 --> 14:08.710
Wow. Way to lose focus.

14:10.046 --> 14:14.049
Sorry. We have shown that the
defendant could not have possibly...

14:14.083 --> 14:15.348
Are... Are you gonna eat that right now?

14:15.518 --> 14:17.114
Uh, Perrin, if you're gonna be working

14:17.214 --> 14:18.820
the sandwich into your argument...

14:18.855 --> 14:20.322
bad idea.

14:21.658 --> 14:23.626
Again, sorry.

14:24.928 --> 14:27.296
Uh... we have shown that the defendant

14:27.330 --> 14:30.633
could not have possibly
committed the crime...

14:30.667 --> 14:32.368
crimes of which he has been accused,

14:32.402 --> 14:35.938
because, well... huh, because
he just simply wasn't there.

14:35.972 --> 14:39.263
- Ms. Perrin? You okay?
- No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, thank you.

14:40.177 --> 14:43.813
And... seeing as he
wasn't there, he, uh...

14:43.847 --> 14:47.149
Oh my... Oh, my God!

14:49.000 --> 14:55.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

14:57.361 --> 14:58.895
I think you have a call.

15:06.270 --> 15:09.106
This is just like the awards
ceremonies for doctors, except,

15:09.140 --> 15:12.943
we don't give awards, we just...
save lives and don't brag about it.

15:14.879 --> 15:17.347
Dr. Dobbs, I know this
is none of my business,

15:17.382 --> 15:18.915
but can I be honest with you?

15:18.950 --> 15:22.052
Which implies you've been dishonest
with me up until this point,

15:22.086 --> 15:23.121
but sure, go ahead.

15:24.389 --> 15:26.920
Bottom line, I don't think Tucker
thinks he's important to you.

15:27.359 --> 15:30.809
Well, that's ridiculous. I
heavily imply it constantly.

15:31.763 --> 15:34.598
You know what? I don't think
you're a very good mother.

15:34.633 --> 15:39.336
You're uncaring, you're cold, and
you make Tucker feel like crap.

15:39.371 --> 15:42.216
Is it so hard to show your son
that you're proud of what he does?

15:42.316 --> 15:46.252
Even my mom shows me that she
loves me, and she hates me.

15:46.286 --> 15:48.521
I don't care how deep you
have to dig to find an ounce

15:48.555 --> 15:51.301
of unconditional love and
support, but you better do it.

15:51.892 --> 15:53.493
Because he deserves it.

15:55.062 --> 15:57.063
How long have you two been dating?

16:02.269 --> 16:04.904
Hey, hey... how'd it
go? Did you kill it?

16:04.939 --> 16:07.156
Oh, I killed it. Yeah,
uh, I killed my career.

16:07.256 --> 16:08.970
You know what? And it's my fault, for

16:09.070 --> 16:10.227
thinking that I could have it all,

16:10.261 --> 16:12.496
that I could be a mom,
and this hotshot lawyer,

16:12.530 --> 16:13.901
when the truth is, I
can't even go five minutes

16:14.001 --> 16:16.636
without barfing in somebody's handbag.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.472
You puked in a purse?

16:18.506 --> 16:20.379
Yes. I did.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.394
And it was a really nice purse.

16:23.545 --> 16:25.078
Look, they'll never give
me junior partner now.

16:25.113 --> 16:26.980
I can't believe I
thought I could do this.

16:27.015 --> 16:28.348
You can do this.

16:28.383 --> 16:31.084
You can do anything
because you're Riley Perrin.

16:31.119 --> 16:32.753
You're gonna be the mother to my child,

16:32.787 --> 16:35.122
and if you want something...
you're gonna get it!

16:35.156 --> 16:37.057
Danny, Danny!

16:37.091 --> 16:39.922
Hey. I'm Danny Wheeler, Riley's fiancé.

16:40.022 --> 16:42.190
I never touched her, don't hurt my face.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.360
What? No. No, I just
want you all to know

16:46.395 --> 16:48.362
that you're making a terrible mistake.

16:48.397 --> 16:50.231
So what if she's pregnant?

16:50.265 --> 16:51.632
Yeah... that's right.

16:51.667 --> 16:55.035
She's not fat. She's got
a kid shoved up in there!

16:57.139 --> 16:59.640
My hero.

16:59.675 --> 17:02.220
But you should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

17:02.246 --> 17:04.145
She's managed to outwork all of you,

17:04.246 --> 17:08.108
24-7, round the clock, learning
this case inside and out,

17:08.208 --> 17:11.042
just to prove what I've always known...

17:11.077 --> 17:13.878
that she can do anything
she sets her mind to.

17:13.914 --> 17:17.282
And that's exactly the kind of
lawyer you should make partner.

17:20.921 --> 17:22.588
Surprise.

17:24.257 --> 17:26.291
Uhh... What... What is going on?

17:26.326 --> 17:28.928
Oh, my God, I did it. I got you the job!

17:30.530 --> 17:32.936
We decided on you last week. I set up

17:33.036 --> 17:34.256
this whole closing arguments thing

17:34.331 --> 17:37.222
just to get you down here so
that we could surprise you.

17:37.322 --> 17:41.158
Puking into Sandy's
handbag was just a bonus.

17:41.193 --> 17:46.297
But, for the record, you being
pregnant was never an issue.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.799
Is that how HR told me to say it?

17:50.469 --> 17:52.103
So you knew?

17:52.137 --> 17:54.705
- How?
- Well, you stopped drinkin' coffee,

17:54.740 --> 17:57.080
and you switched to water at happy hour,

17:57.106 --> 17:59.502
and, well, your office
smells like vomit.

18:01.180 --> 18:04.725
And the winner for Outstanding
Daytime Special goes to...

18:05.284 --> 18:09.312
A Very Hart-Felt Mother's Day.

18:09.388 --> 18:11.639
Oh, my God, I did it, I won!

18:11.724 --> 18:13.926
- What are you doing?
- I'm going with you.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.083
Wait! Where are you going?

18:15.183 --> 18:16.862
You just told me I need to
show him I'm proud of him.

18:16.896 --> 18:17.896
I didn't mean now!

18:17.931 --> 18:19.698
No, don't... No, ow! Ohh!

18:19.732 --> 18:21.767
Okay, fine. But not a word out of you!

18:21.801 --> 18:24.102
Wow, to say this is a
surprise is an under...

18:24.137 --> 18:26.940
Tucker, darling, I'm so happy for you.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.507
Who's this woman?

18:28.541 --> 18:29.608
I'm his mother.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.076
- Who are you?
- I'm his mother.

18:31.110 --> 18:35.948
That's right. Tucker Dobbs
has... has two mommies.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.383
Two white mommies.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.085
Tonight was a journey long in the...

18:40.119 --> 18:42.054
Where the hell have
you been all this time?

18:42.088 --> 18:43.552
Um, saving lives?

18:43.552 --> 18:45.221
Why is this woman
pretending to be your mother?

18:45.321 --> 18:46.554
Can we please do this later?

18:46.589 --> 18:48.998
- As I was saying...
- And why are you even here?

18:49.198 --> 18:50.663
Did they run out of ice?

18:50.899 --> 18:53.568
I... I don't know who you
are, but it would be terrific

18:53.602 --> 18:54.736
if you would just shut up.

18:54.770 --> 18:56.838
Hey hey hey, how about you both shut up?

18:56.872 --> 18:58.039
I just wanna dedicate this to...

18:58.073 --> 18:59.873
So what you're saying is
I'm not good enough for him?

18:59.909 --> 19:01.929
Well, from what I hear, you're not
good enough for a lot of people.

19:02.029 --> 19:04.630
Oh, 'kay, well, I'm here
now, so you can leave.

19:04.665 --> 19:05.765
No, you can leave.

19:05.799 --> 19:07.033
Oh, I wish I could leave.

19:07.067 --> 19:08.634
Tucker, I need to talk to you.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.103
Seriously, can we do this later?

19:11.138 --> 19:12.405
I never really wanted kids.

19:12.439 --> 19:14.373
And we're doing this now.

19:14.408 --> 19:17.114
I just want you to know that
I really do love you, Tucker.

19:17.278 --> 19:19.545
And I'm sorry if I have
a hard time showing it.

19:21.482 --> 19:22.915
I love you, too, Mom.

19:24.918 --> 19:26.386
Oh...

19:32.426 --> 19:34.061
Powerful stuff, huh?

19:34.428 --> 19:35.618
And I just wanted to
say that I really...

19:35.718 --> 19:37.142
Not now, Mrs. Wheeler.

19:37.665 --> 19:40.618
Wheeler? Bonnie Wheeler?

19:41.004 --> 19:44.073
You're the woman who
slept with my husband?

19:44.107 --> 19:47.276
No, no, you are thinking of
a different Bonnie Wheeler,

19:47.310 --> 19:48.477
You know what? I'm gonna go get her.

19:48.511 --> 19:50.412
- 'Kay?
- Get back here.

19:50.447 --> 19:52.448
Mom! This way, through the kitchen!

19:52.543 --> 19:54.012
You know, just once,
I'd like to not have

19:54.038 --> 19:55.437
to run out of someplace fancy with you.

19:56.547 --> 19:57.948
Wait! No, I...

19:57.982 --> 20:01.618
Wow. I just... uh...

20:05.256 --> 20:06.756
- Come on, man.
- The music's on.

20:09.498 --> 20:11.836
Hey, maybe the most awkward
acceptance speech ever

20:11.936 --> 20:13.303
but you're back in the TV biz.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.505
Yeah, only if I get a job selling them.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.208
Every one of those
interviews got canceled.

20:18.242 --> 20:19.509
I'm sorry, man.

20:19.544 --> 20:21.578
But your mom did show up.

20:21.612 --> 20:24.614
Yeah. Hey, she told me what you said.

20:25.716 --> 20:26.783
Thank you, Ben.

20:27.919 --> 20:31.321
You know, sometimes I wish
I was a part of your family.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.789
Your mom might be crazy,
