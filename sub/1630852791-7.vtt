You see any pine trees?

right up ahead.

That's something big,
too, buddy.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.390

be in here stumbling around for?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.439
Listen, what's that moaning?

04:01.642 --> 04:04.409
- You hear that?
- It's right over there.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.346
That could have been a big old
momma bear standing up on her hind feet.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.047
Can you hear that?

04:09.116 --> 04:09.915
I sure did.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.617
[Huck] Was that a groan?

04:11.619 --> 04:13.952
Sounded like it
ripped a big fart.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.154
Do you hear that?
[makes groaning noise]

04:16.757 --> 04:18.390

- [farting sound]

04:20.628 --> 04:22.861

- I can tell you.
- [farting sound]

04:27.701 --> 04:31.036

04:44.485 --> 04:45.750
You hear that?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.619
Sound like he's walking off
and away, you hear him, Willy?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.955
- Yeah.
- You and Cowboy?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.758
Hey, what do you say?
Let's ease up around there

04:52.760 --> 04:54.960
and try to check out and
see what the hell this was.

04:54.962 --> 04:59.064
Hell, yeah. Lay some eyes
on him. Come on. Come on.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.101
- [Buck] Hey.
- [Huck] Yeah.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.436
Let's slip up there
and check it out.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.906
All right. We need to
take our time and go slow.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.175
And, Jeff, you need to work
the hell out of that thermal.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.209
Come on.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.079
[Jeff] Yeah.

Oh, man! Wow!

05:21.522 --> 05:23.655
It smells like [bleep] house.

Yeah, it smells like it's coming
from right up here to your right, Bill.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.427
It's stinking like hell up here.

05:32.066 --> 05:36.234
Guys, we've never found
anything like this. This is unreal.

05:36.904 --> 05:37.969
[Jeff] Take it easy.

05:40.107 --> 05:40.972
Hey...

05:40.974 --> 05:42.107
What have we got?

05:42.643 --> 05:43.408
I see an entrance.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.312
Here, step back. Step back.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.981
- Just stay behind us.
- I am.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.283
Move up, move up.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.285
I will go in.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.788
You're awful ballsy tonight.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.857
I wanna check this thing out.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.059
[Huck] All right, go easy, Buck.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.130
[Buck] Oh, my!

06:06.166 --> 06:07.432
Guys, this is awesome.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.168
My gosh!

06:10.671 --> 06:12.404
Check this thing out.

06:12.406 --> 06:15.674
We've seen Bigfoot nests
before with the Grassman...

06:15.676 --> 06:17.175
What the hell is this, guys?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.877
[Huck] That's that
thing's nest. You look.

It's a nest.

- It is a nest.

<i>[Buck] The Midnight Whistler.</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:28.320
But none of them can even hold
a candle to what we just found.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.392
<i>It's not even like comparing
apples and oranges,</i>

06:33.394 --> 06:34.960
it's like comparing
apples and meatballs.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.562
You gotta see the way
this thing's weaved together.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.931
Buck, I'm not liking
you in there.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.900
It's all out of pine.
Every bit of it's pine.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.601
- Buck--
- [wood snaps]

06:42.603 --> 06:43.802
- Whoa!
- [man bleeps]

06:43.804 --> 06:46.571
[Jeff] Go on. Right up
through there, Buck.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.841
The noise was coming
from right over there.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.944
Oh, listen, he's coming
up the creek. We gotta move.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.481
[bleeping]

06:56.549 --> 06:58.683
Oh, man! He's right there
in the crick.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.352
- [Buck] Turn the lights out.
- [Huck] Holy-- Jeff.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.589
- You all right?
- [bleeps]

07:04.591 --> 07:05.957
<i>[Buck] We bailed and took off,</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:07.859
Jeff about knocked
himself out. He fell so hard.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.595
Get up out of there,
Huck. Let's go.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.764
We gotta hunker down here
and hide.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.599
- You okay, Jeff?
- Yeah, get me up out of here.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.767
[Huck] Here, get him up here.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.770
I think that Bigfoot
is coming back to his nest.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.005
Get him up here
behind this big hickory tree.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.007
[Huck] Come on.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.375
Listen, listen.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.245
He's coming back to the nest,
guys. He's coming back to the nest

07:28.415 --> 07:30.115
Turn the lights out,
turn the lights out.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.720
It smells like it's coming
from right up here.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.155
It's burning my eyes.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.724
- Yeah, that stench--
- Holy [bleep]!

07:39.726 --> 07:41.193
Check this out, boys.
Look at this.

07:41.195 --> 07:42.360
[Willy] What do you see, Bill?

07:45.432 --> 07:47.032
Oh, wow!

07:48.936 --> 07:51.036
Oh, my! Is that [bleep]?

07:51.038 --> 07:53.038
It damn sure looks it!

07:53.974 --> 07:55.407
[Willy] Damn.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.976
That's the damn noise
we heard up here.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.712
The old squatch
has got the squirts.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.546
Right there it is.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.782
A big old pile of diarrhea.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.785
That gotta be two or three
damn gallons of feces here.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.153
There's faces here,

08:08.155 --> 08:09.688
faces there,

08:09.690 --> 08:11.656
more feces here.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.726
Boy, he really loaded
that bush up with feces.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.995
Looks like he opened
the damn floodgates.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.830
I'll tell you what
come flying out.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.332
A bunch of damn poop!

08:20.334 --> 08:22.601
What are you thinking, Bill?

08:22.603 --> 08:25.971
Well, being a professor of poop,
Cowboy, I'm glad you asked me that.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.206
I'ma try to piece this together.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.977
He's got one big-ass foot
right here,

08:31.979 --> 08:33.912
you go look, right here, over
there, that's the other one, right there.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.081
You can see it, plain as day.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.315
All right, he's been
like this here.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.985
I mean, he's a big bastard,
he's all sprawled out here, right?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.653
So he's right here,

08:41.655 --> 08:44.556
I mean, he's got a lot
of pressure right here, right?

08:44.558 --> 08:45.991
He's getting these tree
to his advantage.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.959
Put them right like this
right here,

08:47.961 --> 08:49.995
and I mean, he's getting
in motion,

08:50.063 --> 08:52.130
[straining]

08:53.734 --> 08:56.034
All right, there! Right there!

08:56.036 --> 09:00.205
And I mean, the feces was
just flying back through there.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.743
You can see,
clear back on that bush.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.778
Put your peepers on this.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.847
Looking down to this pile
of squatch poop,

09:08.915 --> 09:10.782
it's beautiful.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.718
That is some first-class
squatch droppings.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.120
[chuckling]

09:15.122 --> 09:17.022
Almost brings a tear to my eye.

09:17.024 --> 09:17.956
Well, see. Look here.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.259
That looks like it's a brown
ball of [bleep].

09:21.261 --> 09:25.230
<i>[Bill] Hands down, this has got to
be the most spectacular specimen</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:29.100
that any human being has had
the honor of laying their eyes on.

09:29.102 --> 09:33.004
This is more diarrhea
than I ever saw.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.240
And I've seen a bunch of it.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.042
Check this out, boys.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.944
- [Willy] Oh!
- You know what that is, huh?

09:38.946 --> 09:39.945
That's [bleep], Bill.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.980
- You know what that is?
- That's [bleep].

09:41.982 --> 09:44.416
I'll tell you right now.
When I'm 90 years old,

09:44.418 --> 09:45.717
I'll remember this moment.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.919
We just heard that son
of a bitch walking off.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.422
He's headed right back down
towards that nest right down there.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.856
It went away right there.
Yes, sir.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.492
What do you say we get these
weapons, we head down the other way?

09:54.494 --> 09:57.996
This was a Bigfoot up here
that let loose,

09:57.998 --> 10:01.032
we're gonna track his big hairy
ass, see if we can't lay eyes on him.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.402
Hell, it won't be hard, hard
to find him moaning or farting.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.204
- [both laughing]
- Come on, Cowboy.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.405
Let's get the hell out
of here, brother.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.909
Mark my words,
we're gonna follow his rectum,

10:10.911 --> 10:12.077
then we'll catch him.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.178
Come on, Cowboy.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.550
Listen, wow!

10:18.552 --> 10:21.019
Man, he's coming up the creek.
He's coming up the creek.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.888
[whispers indistinctly]
Jeff, get that thermal moving.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.423
[Jeff] Damn.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.793
Man, he is hitting
everything up through there.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.463
He sounds like a deer crashing
when it's on its way to die.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.798
Yeah, it's exactly like it.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.300
<i>[Buck] There's something
wrong with this Bigfoot.</i>

10:35.302 --> 10:36.801
<i>It's stumbling around,</i>

10:36.803 --> 10:39.437
it sounds like he's dragging
its leg. Something's not right.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.406
[Jeff whispering]
Oh, I got him.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.041
I got him, I got him.

10:43.043 --> 10:43.441
Yeah.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.978
He's in the nest.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.814
[Jeff whispering] Oh,
I got him. I got him.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.116
- You got him?
- Yeah.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.420
[Jeff] He's in the nest.

10:55.856 --> 10:56.955
Yeah.

10:58.392 --> 10:59.391
Can you see him in there?

10:59.393 --> 11:02.594
Yeah, looks like
he's laying down.

11:02.596 --> 11:05.930
I'm telling you, this Bigfoot is
hurt or injured. Something's wrong.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.165
- Something's wrong with him.
- Yeah.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.000
- Yes, it is.
- Wow.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.936
[growling]

11:11.938 --> 11:13.405
Damn! It's up in there.

11:13.407 --> 11:14.238
Listen! Listen!

11:14.240 --> 11:15.940
[growling continues]

11:16.943 --> 11:19.177
Son of a bitch!

11:20.614 --> 11:22.681
Listen to that bastard roar!

11:22.683 --> 11:26.151
All of a sudden, we hear
a son-of-a-bitching roar.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.820
That son of a bitch is
vibrating me in my boots.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.890
[Bill speaking]

11:31.892 --> 11:35.060
By God, we have heard that
big son of a bitch before.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.227
That's the Grafton Monster.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.595
Yes.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.097
I think that thing's
over by Willy.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.633
Ain't no good gonna
come out of this.

11:41.635 --> 11:43.401
Guys, can you hear
this Grafton Monster?

11:43.403 --> 11:47.038
That son of a bitch can't be
no more than 60-70 yards out.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.578
We're gonna have to move. This
son of a bitch is right here beside us.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.046
Let's get the hell out of here.

11:57.651 --> 11:58.783
Let's get in there
and hunker down,

11:58.785 --> 11:59.818
'cause we're damn too close

11:59.820 --> 12:01.619
- to that Grafton Monster right now.
- You--

12:01.621 --> 12:04.622
We're right in the heart of
the Grafton Monster's territory,

12:04.624 --> 12:06.524
<i>and by God, this is not good.</i>

12:06.526 --> 12:08.660
- Welcome to monster hunting, Cowboy.
- [chuckles]

12:08.662 --> 12:10.361
[Bill] This ain't
no [bleep], you know.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.665
We need to get our asses
in that blind, hunker down,

12:13.667 --> 12:17.769
or that big hairy bastard finds
us and rips our damn heads off.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.804
Hey! There's the blind.
Come on!

12:19.806 --> 12:20.939
Let's get there and hunker
down. Come on, Cowboy.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.540
Let's go. Double time!

12:22.542 --> 12:24.008
That door's round
the other side, guys.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.410
That Grafton Monster's
right there. Come on!

12:25.979 --> 12:27.445
I don't think...

12:27.513 --> 12:28.813
- [Bill] Let's get the hell out first. Go! Go!
- [Willy] Let's get inside.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.381
[Bill] Go on, Cowboy.
Get the hell in there.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.416
[Willy] Hunker down,
get in there.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.818
[Bill] Willy,
get the hell in here.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.386
- Close that door!
- [Willy] Get that door shut.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.690
Son of a bitch.
Hey, get your lights out.

12:38.692 --> 12:43.061
Turn off your lights.
Kill your lights.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.698
Jeff, can you see anything
on the thermal?

12:46.700 --> 12:49.601
Nah. Buck, he went
down the creek.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.970
I wanna take advantage of this.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.806
I slip down there. I'd like to
take a couple of pictures to show

12:54.808 --> 12:56.674
Willy, Bill and Cowboy.

12:56.676 --> 12:57.876
- [Huck] Okay.
- [Jeff] All right.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.843
All right, you guys ready?

12:58.845 --> 12:59.410
Yeah.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.079
Listen, listen.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.814
That Bigfoot's coming
out of the nest.

13:02.816 --> 13:03.948
He's coming out of the nest!

13:03.950 --> 13:05.517
-[Jeff] Yeah, he is. There he goes.
-[Buck] Get ready.

13:05.519 --> 13:08.820
- He's heading straight towards the Grafton Monster.
- [Huck] Yeah, he is.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.022
As soon as that Grafton
Monster bellowing stopped,

13:11.024 --> 13:13.424
that Bigfoot took off
like a madman.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.660
Sounds like we got
a turf war here.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.929
He did not like that noise
at all.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.331
My God. We better be
on our toes, mister.

13:21.802 --> 13:22.967
[wood snaps]

13:22.969 --> 13:24.202
[whispering] Son of a bitch.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.169
[shushes]

13:25.171 --> 13:27.205
[Bill whispering]

13:27.207 --> 13:28.306
[Willy whispering]

13:32.412 --> 13:34.279
Sounds like it's walking
on all fours.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.950
- Damn, that sounds big.
- [shushes]

13:38.952 --> 13:41.653
<i>[Willy] We can hear something
right outside of this blind,</i>

13:41.655 --> 13:43.888
<i>and it's down on all four legs.</i>

13:43.890 --> 13:45.757
That Grafton Monster,
he's on two.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.125
Listen, listen.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.527
There's another one over here.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.029
- [Bill] Son of a bitch.
- [Willy] Damn.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.698
-That's two of them.
-[Bill] Son of a bitch. I hear them too.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.732
Could that be a coyote?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.067
Oh, hell no, Cowboy!

13:56.069 --> 13:57.535
That's way too big for a co--

13:57.537 --> 13:59.871
A little old 30-pound coyote.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.840
[Willy] Damn, that sounds like
it's about 400-500 pounds.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.142
[Bill] Yeah,
now you're talking. Yeah.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.410
If I was a betting man,

14:05.412 --> 14:06.945
that son of a bitch
is a smoke wolf.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.379
[snarls]

14:08.381 --> 14:09.613
Let's get the hell out of here!

14:09.615 --> 14:11.449
It ain't gonna be long them
smoke wolves is gonna find us

14:11.451 --> 14:13.484
right inside this blind.
They're gonna smell us out.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.854
- By God, we could wind up for dinner.
- You're right.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.022
It's not safe to be in this
son-of-a-bitching blind.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.724
What we need to do

14:19.726 --> 14:21.392
- is make a break for it.
- Hell, yeah.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.426
[Willy] Damn straight.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.895
We're gonna make
a damn break for it.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.663
- You're next, Cowboy.
- [Bill] Come on, Cowboy.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.498
[Willy] Son of a bitch.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.834
Just like a couple of jailbirds
getting the hell out of the clink.

14:29.836 --> 14:33.705
Hey, Buck, there's no way
we could meet you at that nest.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.573
[Willy on radio] <i>We just
left that ground blind,</i>

14:35.575 --> 14:37.342
and I think there's something
following us.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.777
<i>I'll meet you up
on that high ridge.</i>

14:39.779 --> 14:41.346
-All right, Willy. We're on it.
-[speaks indistinctly]

14:41.348 --> 14:43.681
All right, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

14:43.683 --> 14:47.051
<i>[Buck] The rest of the team, sounds
like they've got something on their tail.</i>

14:47.053 --> 14:48.953
We need to meet up
and get on the same page.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.221
Hey! Yo!

14:51.925 --> 14:52.790
Damn!

14:52.792 --> 14:53.691
[sighs]

14:53.693 --> 14:54.926
You guys all right?

14:54.928 --> 14:57.128
Yeah, we're fine.
You guys okay?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.097
- Yeah.
- Hell of a lot better now.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.832
What happened?

15:00.834 --> 15:03.701
We was pinned down
in that damn blind out there.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.836
A couple things got excited.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.971
They sounded big.
On all fours.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.640
I gotta bet it was smoke wolves.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.041
That's right.
You're right, Bill.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.577
I do believe they were Smoke
wolves outside that blind.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.213
- Really?
- [Willy] Hell, yeah.

15:15.215 --> 15:19.784
Dude, you will not believe
this Bigfoot nest we found.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.386
Oh, no!

15:21.388 --> 15:23.354
I'm gonna guess it's
probably 16-foot tall.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.755
[Huck] At least.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.225
- [Bill] Damn!
- And probably 30-some-foot around.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.960
- That big?
- [Jeff] Yeah.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.995
Biggest nest, hands down,
we've ever found.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.764
This thing is unbelievable.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.099
I was down there at that nest,

15:35.101 --> 15:39.270
and, dude, we hear something
crashing, coming down the crick.

15:39.673 --> 15:40.705
It was that Bigfoot.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.740
And, dude, I swear,
something's gotta be wrong

15:42.742 --> 15:48.246
because he was busting back
and forth like he was about to fall.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.182
I'm wondering if he did get into
a fight with that Grafton Monster

15:51.184 --> 15:53.718
and he's all jacked up. 'Cause
I'm telling you, something's not right.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.988
- We heard the same damn thing.
- Oh, yeah. It was making all kinds of noises.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.724
Stumbling and falling around
over and moaning

15:59.726 --> 16:02.860
and groaning and one time, it...

16:02.862 --> 16:03.861
sounded like he might have been

16:03.863 --> 16:06.864
ripping one off,
passing the old flatulence.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.833
Are you serious? You guys
hear a Bigfoot fart?

16:08.835 --> 16:10.068
- [all laughing]
- Whoo!

16:10.070 --> 16:11.235
Oh, we heard more than that.

16:11.237 --> 16:13.938
[all laughing]

16:13.940 --> 16:15.340
What happened?

16:15.342 --> 16:17.075
We was walking up there...

16:17.277 --> 16:19.944
See what the hell
was making that noise.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.680
When we got up there, man, you can
smell something and I walked right up

16:22.682 --> 16:24.148
and I'm telling you what,

16:24.150 --> 16:28.386
he had dumped, probably about
10 to 15 gallons of the old diarrhea.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.321
I mean shot it clear back there.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.790
I mean, he ate some [bleep].

16:32.792 --> 16:35.827
He was standing there, and I
mean, there was couple poles there,

16:35.829 --> 16:38.796
And he just got a hold of them
like this here.

16:38.798 --> 16:44.002
Blam! Flew back there
probably, 30 or 40 feet.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.738
I ain't [bleep]. Ask Willy
and Cowboy right there.

16:46.740 --> 16:49.073
I even got down and examined
what it had been eating.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.409
Oh, Bill was up
to his elbows in it.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.211
Oh, my God!

16:53.213 --> 16:55.947
[all laughing]

16:55.949 --> 16:57.415
Oh, man.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.018
Well, guys, listen,
it's been a long night,

17:00.387 --> 17:02.086
we've accomplished a lot.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.421
What do you say,
we call it a night?

17:03.990 --> 17:04.856
Hell, yeah.

17:04.858 --> 17:05.723
We call it a night.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.792
All right, guys,
let's get out of here.

17:07.794 --> 17:11.329
Tonight, we came out to try to
find that nest and we found it.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.999
That thing is incredible.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.970
We also learned that
that Bigfoot,

17:18.972 --> 17:21.406
he got set off when he heard
that Grafton Monster bellow.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.474
[growling]

17:23.476 --> 17:25.143
Damn, it's up in there.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.846
We also need to figure out
what the rest of the team heard

17:28.848 --> 17:29.680
right out by that blind.

17:29.682 --> 17:30.982
Listen.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.384
[Bill] There's another
over here.

17:33.386 --> 17:37.021
We haven't been focused on
smoke wolf since we've been out here.

17:37.023 --> 17:40.124
If I was a betting man, that
son of a bitch is a smoke wolf.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.360
But it's starting to sound like we
need to throw him back in the mix.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.928
[snarls]

17:43.930 --> 17:46.230
-Hop right up there.
-Come on, Cowboy. Get up here, brother.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.968
[all laughing]

17:55.975 --> 17:58.009
<i>[Buck] We're getting ready
to meet with a local here</i>

17:58.011 --> 17:58.976
in the Tygart Valley named Rick.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.545
- He's supposed to be down this way.
- Yeah.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.780
[Jeff] Yeah, he said down here
in the south end of the woods.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.649
<i>[Buck] We know that there's
a Bigfoot out here,</i>

18:04.651 --> 18:06.184
and we know we have
the Grafton Monster.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.586
- Hey.
- Yeah, that's who we're looking for.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.720
But after the other night...

18:09.722 --> 18:10.788
- I'm Buck.
- How you doing, Buck?

18:10.790 --> 18:11.789
almost certain
there's something else.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.492
- Wild Bill, hoo-rah!
- Wild Bill.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.727
<i>[Buck] We're hoping
that we can meet with Rick,</i>

18:16.729 --> 18:18.463
and he might be able
to give us some information

18:18.465 --> 18:21.466
to help us figure out
what we're up against.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.635
[Buck] Well, Rick, we've been spending
a lot of time in the Tygart Valley,

18:24.637 --> 18:28.906
and one thing that really stands
out to us is there's quite the mystery

18:28.908 --> 18:31.242
when it comes to canines
in the Tygart Valley.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.846
Jeff told me you had
quite an encounter

18:34.848 --> 18:36.013
that we would love
to hear about.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.682
-[Jeff] Yes, sir.
-No problem. Not a problem at all.

18:37.684 --> 18:41.586
I live about 200 yards over
that way on the flat up there,

18:41.588 --> 18:44.589
I go down this way down
the holler here to the crick,

18:44.591 --> 18:47.158
'cause I get up in the
morning to go fishing.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.393
When I go down there and fish
and I'm always looking around,

18:49.395 --> 18:53.264
you know, you're see coon
tracks. Some coyote tracks and...

18:53.266 --> 18:55.666
You know, just things like that while
I'm down there fishing, you know.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.401
Oh, yeah.

18:57.403 --> 19:00.371
But it's... Coyote tracks
started getting a little heavy.

19:01.007 --> 19:01.906
Really?

19:01.908 --> 19:04.976
A lot of coyote tracks?

19:04.978 --> 19:07.311
A lot more than I'd ever seen
for a long time.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.948
So...

19:10.950 --> 19:13.317
are we talking about, you know,

19:13.319 --> 19:14.986
generally, you see
two or three sets

19:14.988 --> 19:19.924
and now you're seeing six, seven,
I mean, what are you dealing with?

19:19.926 --> 19:21.959
Never seen nothing
like this before.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.529
The place is completely
polluted with tracks.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.963
There was no place
in between tracks.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.099
It was track on track
on track on track.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.734
I don't even see
any other tracks.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.803
Rick told us he found a whole pile of
coyote tracks right down by that creek.

19:32.805 --> 19:36.140
- Nothing but coyote tracks?
- Nothing but coyote tracks.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.843
For all those coyote tracks
to be in that one area,

19:38.845 --> 19:41.812
it sounds like something's
pushing them down to that one spot.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.347
Something's not adding up.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.184
[Rick] Let me tell you
what happened four nights ago.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.919
Back down over here,

19:47.921 --> 19:51.255
down by that crick up on the
neighbor's plot, over there, on the ridge,

19:51.591 --> 19:53.724
them coyotes lit up

19:53.726 --> 19:56.027
like I've never heard
the coyotes light up before.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.095
It wasn't just one hollering
over here,

19:58.097 --> 19:59.830
one hollering over here,

19:59.832 --> 20:02.300
it was the whole ridge,

20:02.302 --> 20:06.771
was lit up like they were
on fire or something.

20:06.773 --> 20:10.708
Just a whole line from there all
the way over here? Just a solid line?

20:10.710 --> 20:13.010
[Rick] Clearly, no break in it.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.413
This... It was
deafening, almost.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.882
Wow!

20:17.884 --> 20:21.452
Rick said he could hear a
solid line of coyotes yelling.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.721
All the way across this ridge.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.823
There shouldn't be that
many coyotes in one spot.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.459
That don't sound right.
They don't pack up like that.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.229
Something here is definitely
out of place.

20:32.098 --> 20:35.032
Do you think that there was,
maybe, a pack down here

20:35.034 --> 20:37.134
and a pack up there or...

20:37.737 --> 20:41.839
No, it was a solid sound.

20:41.841 --> 20:46.277
Didn't quit, except for right
about a half hour after it started...

20:48.715 --> 20:50.147
Dead silence.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.252
You're saying that it stopped
all at the same time?

20:54.821 --> 20:55.786
Quit, clear quit.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.288
It was total silence?

20:58.224 --> 20:59.991
Just as quiet
as it is right now.

20:59.993 --> 21:03.728
For a whole lot of coyotes
to be sounding off like that

21:03.730 --> 21:06.063
and then just abruptly
stopped them,

21:06.633 --> 21:08.432
something has scared the hell
out of them,

21:09.569 --> 21:11.269
or something turfed them
the [bleep] out.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.405
We've heard that happen
one time.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.807
And it didn't turn out well
for the coyotes, did it?

21:16.809 --> 21:19.343
Oh, hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah!

21:19.946 --> 21:21.612
Right here in the Tygart Valley.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.281
Last time we was
in the Tygart Valley,

21:23.283 --> 21:26.884
we could hear several coyotes
packed up like that...

21:26.886 --> 21:30.187
- Dude, that sounds like a massive dog fight. Listen.
- [coyotes yipping]

21:31.057 --> 21:33.090
And then just like
what you heard,

21:33.926 --> 21:34.992
all at once...

21:35.127 --> 21:35.826
Stopped.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.028
Oh, listen.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.063
It shut down. Stopped.

21:41.067 --> 21:46.003
We went up there and we found
a whole pile of dead coyotes.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.205
Holy [bleep], dude!

21:48.608 --> 21:50.241
[Huck] Holy hell!

21:51.811 --> 21:54.412
This might go whatever
which way you could think of.

21:55.214 --> 21:56.347
What do you think killed them?

21:57.650 --> 21:58.983
[Jeff] We don't think,

21:58.985 --> 22:01.118
we know what killed
those coyotes,

22:01.120 --> 22:02.186
and it was smoke wolves.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.221
[snarls]

22:04.924 --> 22:06.157
Smoke wolves?

22:06.726 --> 22:07.992
- That's right.
- Sure.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.094
When it comes to these coyotes,

22:10.396 --> 22:11.996
<i>the smoke wolves,</i>

22:12.765 --> 22:14.031
<i>they don't [bleep] around.</i>

22:14.400 --> 22:16.033
They will take them out.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.069
Guys, this is just
another reminder

22:18.071 --> 22:21.005
of all the predators that
are here in Tygart Valley.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.773
Ain't bull[bleep] about that.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.375
[snarling]

22:25.745 --> 22:29.413
This Tygart Valley is plumb full

22:29.415 --> 22:32.016
of monsters that will kill you.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.451
Not yet.

22:33.453 --> 22:36.520
What is it about
the Tygart Valley?

22:36.522 --> 22:39.724
<i>It seems like every holler you
step in, there's something different,</i>

22:39.726 --> 22:41.592
a different monster,
they're waiting on you.

22:41.594 --> 22:45.463
Well, Rick, we really appreciate
you sharing your information with us.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.932
We're gonna head out of here,
and we're gonna get to work.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.234
-I appreciate it. I appreciate it.
-Appreciate it.

22:50.236 --> 22:51.702
We need to head out tonight,

22:51.704 --> 22:55.039
go right out where Rick heard
those coyotes, and take a look around.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.007
[Jeff] Come on, Rick,
we'll give you a ride.

22:57.009 --> 22:57.941
We'll give you a ride, brother.

22:57.943 --> 23:01.112
We were focused on Bigfoot,
but right now,

23:01.114 --> 23:02.513
it's time
to go after a smoke wolf.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.382
[Bill speaking]

23:06.352 --> 23:09.153
All right, guys, let's just
go ahead and hit it nose-on.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.622
We're down two team members
tonight. Willy and Huck's out.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.924
- The heat got to them.
- Yeah.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.659
- Sucks.
- Hopefully, they'll be back home to hunt tomorrow.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.862
Yeah, that's for damn sure.

23:17.864 --> 23:20.865
But, we have a hot lead,
and we gotta get on it.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.768
<i>[Buck] Tonight's a little different.
We're down two team members.</i>

23:23.770 --> 23:26.604
We need to take our time,
but we need to dig in,

23:26.606 --> 23:28.873
and find out if there
are smoke wolves in this area.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.942
Well, guys, listening to
Rick today, it sounds like,

23:31.944 --> 23:34.245
whenever these coyotes
start lighting up,

23:34.247 --> 23:35.980
- the smoke wolves come out.
- Yeah.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.883
And, that's what we dealt with
last time we was in Tygart Valley.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.751
Hey, we saw it
[bleep] firsthand.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.553
You ain't kidding, dude.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.854
It was like a massacre.

23:43.856 --> 23:47.792
So, my thought is,
we break out this coyote call,

23:47.794 --> 23:49.427
and see if we can't
get a response.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.429
- Good idea.
- Hell, yeah.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.963
- [Buck] You guys sure?
- Yessir.

23:52.965 --> 23:56.667
And, Jeff, since you've been
doing such a knockout job,

23:56.669 --> 23:58.402
you get to do
some coyote calling.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.805
- [gasps] I get to use your private call?
- Uh-huh.

24:00.807 --> 24:01.872
Oh, this is a privilege.

24:01.874 --> 24:02.940
I must be a good boy.

24:02.942 --> 24:07.011
- Hell, yeah!
- [all laughing]

24:07.013 --> 24:09.413
Here, you wanna just blow in
it and see how you do there?

24:11.117 --> 24:13.651
Not too sure which end
to blow in in this, Buck,

24:13.653 --> 24:15.920
- [all laughing]
- Or do I...

24:15.922 --> 24:17.755
- Do I actually suck on it?
- [all laughing]

24:17.757 --> 24:20.724
- You...
- [all laughing]

24:20.726 --> 24:22.760
- Do whatever feels natural, Jeff.
- [Bill] Yeah.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.628
- [Jeff] Well, well...
- [all laughing]

24:24.630 --> 24:26.130
- Yeah.
- [all laughing]

24:26.132 --> 24:28.065
- Let's see what you got, my man.
- Yeah.

24:28.201 --> 24:28.933
[puffs]

24:28.935 --> 24:32.036
[both laugh]

24:32.038 --> 24:34.605
Well, sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

24:34.673 --> 24:36.874
[puffing]

24:36.876 --> 24:39.777
I've been trying to say
it all along, "Jeff blows."

24:39.779 --> 24:42.847
[laughs]

24:42.849 --> 24:44.782
Try the other end, Jeff, bro.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.050
[puffs]

24:47.987 --> 24:49.153
Jeff, bro, you just...

24:49.155 --> 24:52.089
This is why Jeff's the
researcher and I'm the caller.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.223
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

24:53.225 --> 24:56.160
Expert call, best in the
business, right here he is.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.095
- [Jeff] Hell, yes, he is.
- [Bill] Let 'er rip!

24:59.098 --> 25:06.337
[sounding coyote call]

25:08.674 --> 25:09.773
[Jeff] Think that'll do.

25:09.775 --> 25:12.943
That never gets old.
Listen to that, dude.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.120
[Jeff]
You hear anything, Bill?

25:23.389 --> 25:25.756
Jack [bleep].

25:25.758 --> 25:28.926
We ain't hearing nothing, what do you
guys say, we head in a little bit deeper?

25:28.928 --> 25:29.793
- Hell, yeah. Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

25:29.795 --> 25:30.594
[snapping noise]

25:30.596 --> 25:31.862
- Holy!
- What the hell was that?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.797
-Did you hear that?
-Where did it come from? Over there?

25:33.799 --> 25:34.932
- [Bill] Jeff--
- [Jeff] It's on, it's on.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.867
- I'm on it.
- Listen, listen to it.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.636
- You see anything, Jeff, bro?
- No.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.404
[Jeff] Sounds like it's
about 100 yards out there.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.406
Whatever that is, it's big,
and it's on the move.

25:42.408 --> 25:45.175
It's walking,
you can damn hear it.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.844
I'll tell you what, that's
out there about 100 yards.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.612
Let's jump in the side by side
and run out there

25:48.614 --> 25:49.847
and see if we can't
get it in headlights.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.615
- Come on.
- Jeff, come on, let's go.

25:51.617 --> 25:52.783
- Come on.
- Get in the back, Bill.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.752
We just heard
something up ahead.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.853
It sounds big as hell.

25:55.855 --> 25:56.887
Bill, be lookout.

25:56.889 --> 26:00.057
We jump in side by side,
cruise up there

26:00.059 --> 26:02.226
and see if we can't put some
eyes on this son of a bitch.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.627
Hit it, boys!

26:03.729 --> 26:06.964
<i>It's time for big Buckasaurus
Rex put his foot on the gas.</i>

26:06.966 --> 26:08.866
- [Bill] You guys see anything?
- [Buck] No.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.768
Get the hell up here.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.503
Sounds like it's up this way.
Jeff.

26:12.505 --> 26:14.271
Run that thermal through there.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.108
- [Buck] You see anything?
- [Jeff] Clear, Buck.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.878
This here mobile is going rogue!

26:20.880 --> 26:22.179
[Buck] Bill, you see anything?

26:22.181 --> 26:24.114
[Bill] I ain't seeing
[bleep] up here.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.750
Whatever that was,
it sounded fricking big.

26:26.752 --> 26:27.952
[Jeff] I'm telling you...

26:27.954 --> 26:28.919
[Buck] You see anything, Bill?

26:28.921 --> 26:30.554
[Bill] No,
I ain't seeing [bleep].

26:30.556 --> 26:32.856
[Jeff] It sounded like
it went towards to left.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.792
- [Buck] Ho! Holy [bleep]!
- [Jeff] Oh!

26:34.794 --> 26:36.393
What the hell?

26:44.837 --> 26:47.137
We're back in no-man's-land.

26:50.409 --> 26:53.043
This is smoke wolf central.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.120
Oh, no.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.723
<i>[Buck] We was just
coming up this hill,</i>

27:05.725 --> 27:09.126
and all of a sudden, our lights
hit something that's all too familiar.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.630
<i>[Buck] This big winged wall.</i>

27:12.632 --> 27:15.032
This is the entrance
to no-man's-land.

27:18.704 --> 27:22.906
No-man's-land is the home
of the smoke wolves.

27:22.908 --> 27:28.045
Beyond that wall, waits pure
death, destruction and evil.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.279
Look at this thing.

27:29.982 --> 27:30.948
Wow.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.917
[Bill] That thing
is spooky as hell, boys.

27:33.919 --> 27:36.954
That's even worse than
the last time we seen it.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.089
Why the hell does it have wings?

27:39.759 --> 27:42.126
I have a question for you guys.

27:42.128 --> 27:46.864
Anybody realize that
Rick's neighbor was Dave?

27:46.866 --> 27:48.966
Crocodile Dundee Dave.

27:48.968 --> 27:49.766
Yeah.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.001
[Bill] Hell, right, there he is!

27:51.003 --> 27:53.937
Looks like he's
a no bull[bleep] person.

27:53.939 --> 27:54.938
[Bill] He's got a weapon on him.

27:54.940 --> 27:57.007
I had no idea.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.409
That's crazy as hell.

27:58.411 --> 28:01.945
You guys remember
that smoke wolves' den

28:02.548 --> 28:05.115
is not very far on the other
side of this wall.

28:05.117 --> 28:08.886
Anything that goes
into no-man's-land...

28:08.888 --> 28:10.387
a lot of times
don't come back.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.423
These smoke wolves

28:13.693 --> 28:14.892
will take them out.

28:14.894 --> 28:18.195
Guys, I'm not comfortable
going into no-man's-land.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.864
Not without Willy
and especially without Huck.

28:20.866 --> 28:21.865
No.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.400
We need a full team for that.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.969
Damn right,
we need a full team for this.

28:25.971 --> 28:30.841
I think what we need to do,
is back out of here,

28:30.843 --> 28:32.276
and then, we need
to have a team meeting.

28:32.712 --> 28:33.744
Oh, yeah.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.112
- Hell, yes!
- [rustling]

28:35.114 --> 28:36.714
[Buck] What was that?

28:36.716 --> 28:38.115
[Jeff] Hear that?

28:38.784 --> 28:39.817
[Bill] I heard something.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.418
- Was that footsteps?
- Listen.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.619
[Bill]
I hear something walking.

28:42.621 --> 28:45.022
[rustling]

28:45.891 --> 28:47.624
We need to back
the [bleep] out of here,

28:47.626 --> 28:49.359
and get in the side by side
and get the hell out of here.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.695
You're the expert, yeah,
you're right.

28:51.697 --> 28:54.098
Guys, let's head to the side
by side and let's get out of here.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.632
- [Jeff] Yeah. Let's go.
- Come on.

28:55.634 --> 28:58.402
The best thing that this team
can do right now, is back out.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.836
- Turn back, Bill.
- Bill, watch out.

28:59.838 --> 29:03.640
We are right in the heart of
the smoke wolves' territory.

29:03.642 --> 29:06.009
[Buck] This is dangerous,
guys. We gotta get out of here.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.845
<i>[Buck] We can't afford
to go any farther</i>

29:07.847 --> 29:09.680
without our other
two team members.

29:09.682 --> 29:11.215
It's not safe
and it's not worth it.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.382
- [Buck] Let's roll.
- [Bill] Let's go.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.417
[Bill] Go, Buck!

29:13.419 --> 29:14.918
[Jeff] Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.452
[Bill] Get the hell out of here.

29:16.454 --> 29:19.223
<i>[Buck] It seems like every step
that we take in the Tygart Valley,</i>

29:19.225 --> 29:21.759
there's a curveball
being thrown at us.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.060
<i>It's one surprise
after the other.</i>

29:23.062 --> 29:23.794
[Buck speaking]

29:23.796 --> 29:24.795
[Jeff speaking]

29:25.064 --> 29:26.897
<i>[Buck] The thing
that's got me concerned,</i>

29:26.899 --> 29:27.965
is, "What's next?"

29:27.967 --> 29:29.933
[Bill] Stay on it, Buck!

29:29.935 --> 29:31.301
Get the hell out
of here, come on!

29:36.142 --> 29:42.613
[sounding animal call]

29:42.615 --> 29:45.649
[chuckling]

29:45.651 --> 29:47.885
<i>[Bill] We was gonna
have a team meeting today,</i>

29:47.887 --> 29:49.520
but brother Willy,
and brother Huck,

29:49.522 --> 29:50.821
is still under the weather.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.956
<i>[Bill] So, that gives me
an old brother Buck</i>

29:52.958 --> 29:55.392
<i>a couple of hours
to get out in the woods,</i>

29:55.394 --> 29:56.860
doing a little squatch watch.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.896
[sounding animal call]

29:58.898 --> 30:00.164
[laughing] I can't...

30:00.166 --> 30:01.665
Damn, what you giggling about?

30:01.667 --> 30:04.835
I'm trying my dangdest
calling a squatch.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.403
It sounds like a wet
donkey fart. [laughs]

30:06.405 --> 30:08.172
A what?

30:08.174 --> 30:10.841
Bill asked me to come out and go
squatch watching with him today.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.776
I had no clue I needed earplugs.

30:12.778 --> 30:15.646
[animal call sounding]

30:15.648 --> 30:17.848
Ugh! But, he's Bill.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.650
[exhales] Damn,
I'm getting dizzy.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.485
<i>[Buck] A little unorthodox.</i>

30:21.487 --> 30:23.887
Let's say he colors
outside of the lines.

30:23.889 --> 30:27.090
- I got something I wanna run by you, bro.
- All right.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.859
- Easy, Bill.
- [groans]

30:28.861 --> 30:30.761
- Easy!
- Okay, bro. We're good.

30:30.763 --> 30:33.063
- Don't break it, dude.
- Okay, then.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.665
This is kinda embarrassing.

30:34.733 --> 30:36.066
Oh, boy!

30:36.936 --> 30:38.135
I know, man, you've been
knocking it out of the park, dude.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.137
I know you cut
an ass-load of weight.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.138
Yes, sir.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.041
Well, if you can't tell,

30:44.043 --> 30:46.043
I got just a little problem
going on right here.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.010
[laughs]

30:47.012 --> 30:48.412
Little extra table muscle.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.781
I didn't notice it.

30:50.783 --> 30:51.982
Well, I can suck it in.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.917
[laughs heartily]

30:53.919 --> 30:55.519
Believe it or not,

30:55.521 --> 30:57.588
I used to be built
like a damn Viking.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.890
My damn stomach
looked like a train track.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.825
It feels like
you swallowed a basketball.

31:01.827 --> 31:04.962
I think I see the lines.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.731
Old Father Time's
caught up with me.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.867
<i>Old fat ass is dragging.</i>

31:09.869 --> 31:11.401
I'm ready to make a change!

31:11.403 --> 31:13.003
I was wondering

31:13.906 --> 31:15.405
if you'd help an old bro out,

31:15.407 --> 31:18.008
get back down
to my fighting weight.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.877
Like, probably,

31:19.879 --> 31:22.079
ten years ago when
I was like, 25 years old.

31:22.081 --> 31:25.115
[laughs]

31:25.117 --> 31:27.317
Bill, you know how old
I was ten years ago?

31:27.720 --> 31:28.852
I was 25.

31:28.854 --> 31:31.088
Well, that'd make me and you

31:31.090 --> 31:33.023
- pretty much the same age.
- [both laughing]

31:33.025 --> 31:34.391
I don't think so!

31:34.393 --> 31:35.392
Give me that.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.128
If Bill's 35,

31:38.130 --> 31:39.730
that means he's had
some rough mileage.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.665
Well, they say
you're as young as you feel.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.368
[laughing] Bill, we're not
the same age, dude.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.638
Bill's trying
to shed a few pounds.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.007
First thing up, we'll
take a look at his snacks,

31:50.009 --> 31:51.642
see what kinda goodies he's got.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.877
Let's see what you're fueling
the engine with.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.112
Look at this right here,
brother.

31:55.881 --> 31:56.980
Huh!

31:57.883 --> 31:59.783
Squatch Soda!

31:59.785 --> 32:01.218
Ta-ta!

32:01.620 --> 32:03.053
You made this?

32:03.055 --> 32:05.756
Well, yeah. Easy now,
don't shake it up!

32:05.758 --> 32:07.157
Bill's soda...

32:07.159 --> 32:08.992
You know it's a pretty
well-known brand.

32:08.994 --> 32:12.095
I'm worried there could
be some copyright issues here.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.698
Squatch Soda,
what it says on it.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.866
Right there, can you read?

32:15.868 --> 32:18.936
Bill's like a dog,
taking a leak on stuff.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.671
He just slaps his name on it,
calls it his own.

32:20.673 --> 32:23.006
All right, let's go. Dude,
what else you got in there?

32:23.008 --> 32:25.742
- Now, I'm really having a good time.
- I got one more thing.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.211
Right there you go, brother!
Squatch Jerky!

32:29.782 --> 32:30.714
Squatch Jerky, Bill?

32:30.716 --> 32:31.915
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.751
[Bill] I was heading down
the highway, down I-64.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.753
Down to Hickory, North Carolina.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.989
Come up on this dude right
by the side of the road.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.558
Had a sign out,
said, "sasquatch meat."

32:41.560 --> 32:42.726
Purchased me a few bags.

32:42.728 --> 32:46.763
A guy on the side of the road,
said he hit a sasquatch,

32:46.765 --> 32:49.132
and made it into jerky, and
this is what you bought off of him,

32:49.134 --> 32:50.767
was sasquatch jerky?

32:50.769 --> 32:52.135
Eat up, brother!

32:52.137 --> 32:53.670
I'm afraid to.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.706
<i>[Bill] I don't know if any you
folks out there has ever had you</i>

32:55.708 --> 32:57.874
a big old slab of squatch meat.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.042
<i>Listen to me, friend.</i>

32:59.044 --> 33:00.410
[slurps]

33:00.412 --> 33:03.547
It is gamy and delicious!

33:03.549 --> 33:04.347
Want a drink?

33:04.349 --> 33:05.983
No, no, no!
Oh, he's already...

33:05.985 --> 33:08.085
[laughing]

33:08.087 --> 33:10.787
Damn, what did I put
in that one?

33:10.789 --> 33:12.189
Son of a bitch!

33:12.191 --> 33:13.724
What happened?

33:13.726 --> 33:16.793
[both laughing]

33:16.795 --> 33:18.795
I can't tell you
what's in this Squatch Soda.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.864
It might be radioactive.

33:20.866 --> 33:23.967
- [grunting]
- [Buck laughing]

33:23.969 --> 33:25.869
Son of a bitch!

33:25.871 --> 33:26.670
By God, it's delicious!

33:26.672 --> 33:30.207
[slurps]

33:30.209 --> 33:33.410
Bill, I think I might have
identified the problem here.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.778
Okay, what?

33:34.780 --> 33:38.048
I think we need to cut back
on the snack breaks.

33:38.050 --> 33:41.752
Old Buckaroo, he's telling me
I need to lay down the old fork

33:41.754 --> 33:44.087
and pitch back from the table.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.423
I don't even know
how that's possible, dude.

33:47.026 --> 33:47.824
We'll work on it.

33:47.826 --> 33:48.892
All right, yeah.

33:48.894 --> 33:50.694
Keep the old mouth shut.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.562
Keep the old ass in gear.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.665
Eating less, double-timing more!

33:55.667 --> 33:57.968
All right, listen, we ain't
got a whole lot longer left.

33:57.970 --> 33:58.435
Jeff lined up
an eyewitness for us.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.137
Oh, yeah?

34:00.139 --> 34:01.938
Yeah, we're gonna have to get out of
here in about next 20 minutes, half hour.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.440
Man, hey,

34:03.442 --> 34:05.942
Let's do some more
squatch watch here.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.412
<i>[Buck] I knew squatch watch
with Bill was gonna be interesting.</i>

34:08.414 --> 34:11.114
<i>After today,
I can tell you right now,</i>

34:11.116 --> 34:13.083
he's not allowed out here
by himself no more.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.251
[opens drink can]

34:17.089 --> 34:18.221
[Bill] Who's your daddy?

34:18.223 --> 34:22.259
[laughs]

34:22.261 --> 34:24.795
And he's definitely not
allowed to have that horn again.

34:24.797 --> 34:26.129
Don't blow the horn.

34:26.131 --> 34:32.269
[animal call sounding]

34:37.176 --> 34:37.974
[Bill whispering]
Hear anything?

34:37.976 --> 34:41.078
[Buck laughing]

34:43.515 --> 34:46.450
[Bill laughs] Feels like,
we're driving in the safari.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.019
<i>[Buck] After last night,
finding that wall,</i>

34:49.955 --> 34:52.689
and realizing we was
that close to no-man's-land,

34:52.691 --> 34:54.558
we knew we had
to have a team meeting.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.960
[Bill] It's some rough-ass
terrain out here, bro.

34:56.962 --> 34:59.729
[Jeff] I'm gonna lose five
pounds just shaking it off.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.832
<i>[Buck] But, the only problem is,</i>

35:01.834 --> 35:02.666
Huck and Willy
are still under the weather.

35:02.668 --> 35:05.869
[Bill] She's a bumpy one,
old boy!

35:05.871 --> 35:07.771
<i>[Buck] That's how it goes when
it comes to monster hunting,</i>

35:07.773 --> 35:09.906
the show must go on.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.842
[Jeff] Looks like him
in back of the field.

35:11.844 --> 35:14.411
<i>[Buck] So today, we're
gonna meet with a local</i>

35:14.413 --> 35:16.680
<i>that we believe,
may have some information</i>

35:16.682 --> 35:19.015
on the deer population
here in the Tygart Valley.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.417
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, how you doing?

35:20.419 --> 35:21.751
Hey!

35:21.753 --> 35:23.353
Travis is an expert deer hunter.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.921
Wild Bill, hoo-rah!

35:24.923 --> 35:26.890
<i>[Buck] Every year, he's out
here chasing a big buck,</i>

35:26.892 --> 35:27.924
and he usually gets them.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.860
Little bit of a bumpy
ride in here.

35:29.862 --> 35:32.095
Oh, yeah, you gotta watch,
there's some ruts.

35:32.097 --> 35:34.231
Yeah, I'll damn hell say,
my boobs hurt.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.866
[all laughing]

35:35.868 --> 35:36.766
What?

35:36.768 --> 35:37.834
[Jeff] Man!

35:37.836 --> 35:39.236
Man boobs, his moobs.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.871
[all laughing]

35:40.873 --> 35:41.872
Buck!

35:41.874 --> 35:43.707
About rubbed my nipples raw
on my bibs.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.943
- Oh, Lord! Jeff, bro!
- [all laughing]

35:46.945 --> 35:50.814
Well, Jeff bro's talking
about his nipples chafing.

35:50.816 --> 35:51.748
Wow!

35:51.750 --> 35:53.483
What the hell's next?

35:53.485 --> 35:54.885
[Jeff] Well, look at that, Bill.

35:54.887 --> 35:58.054
- No, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
- Look at that.

35:58.056 --> 35:59.055
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

35:59.057 --> 36:02.759
[all laughing]

36:02.761 --> 36:04.528
I'm just hoping
he keeps it above the belt.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.897
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

36:06.899 --> 36:10.901
might be talking about the
old Jeff bro testicles. Jeffsticles.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.169
Am I leaking?

36:12.771 --> 36:13.537
Ain't pregnant, are you?

36:13.539 --> 36:16.473
- No.
- [all laughing]

36:16.475 --> 36:18.942
- This is gonna be one of those days, isn't it?
- Yeah.

36:20.078 --> 36:22.746
I'd like to go down to the
store and get some Band-Aids.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.381
Once Jeff's
nipple chafing starts,

36:25.150 --> 36:27.184
he's a bear to work with.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.686
[Buck] Well, Travis,

36:29.855 --> 36:32.222
we have quite the mystery going
on out here in the Tygart Valley.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.690
- Yeah, we do.
- For sure.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.693
And we heard,
that you have some information

36:36.695 --> 36:38.595
involving the deer
population out here.

36:38.597 --> 36:41.898
Well, there's definitely something
going on in these woods.

36:41.900 --> 36:47.938
I've got buddies that are finding
bodies of deer without the heads.

36:48.140 --> 36:50.273
And heads of deer
without the bodies.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.842
Yeah, it's almost like

36:52.844 --> 36:55.412
they just... [makes slicing
sound] Took them from the neck.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.947
- Just ripping their damn head off.
- No, I mean,

36:56.949 --> 36:59.816
yeah, guts still in them,
hide still on them.

36:59.818 --> 37:03.620
It's just taking their
heads off, leaving them lay.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.054
<i>[Buck] This isn't the first time</i>

37:05.056 --> 37:07.724
<i>that we've heard about
animals here in the Tygart Valley,</i>

37:07.726 --> 37:09.659
<i>getting their heads
just ripped off.</i>

37:09.661 --> 37:10.894
We know the Grafton Monster

37:10.896 --> 37:13.063
and we believe
that those Bigfoot

37:13.065 --> 37:15.298
have been ripping
the heads off cattle.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.334
It ripped the damn head
clean off of him.

37:18.503 --> 37:22.205
<i>[Buck] Could they be doing the
same thing to these deer out here?</i>

37:22.207 --> 37:24.708
Or could this be something
that the smoke wolves are doing?

37:24.710 --> 37:26.042
[snarling]

37:26.044 --> 37:28.378
You know, I love deer hunting.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.713
I do, too.

37:29.715 --> 37:33.917
And, we've spent countless
times out on our back porch,

37:33.919 --> 37:37.887
watching the deer through
our binoculars, see 40 at a time.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.423
Next thing I knew,
it was 20 deer at a time.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.492
- Really?
- [Travis] And then, I started noticing,

37:42.494 --> 37:44.227
some nights, you see no deer.

37:45.197 --> 37:47.264
- Nothing?
- Yeah, it's almost like they vanished.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.399
Wow!

37:49.401 --> 37:51.568
Something ain't right with that.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.403
Deer population's
on the rise in West Virginia.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.570
- That surprises me.
- [Bill] Yeah.

37:54.572 --> 37:56.606
To me, it seemed like
it's been plummeting.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.342
You know, with the deer
population being down,

37:59.344 --> 38:01.978
maybe the predator
that's in here

38:01.980 --> 38:05.382
has exhausted the deer
population so much, it's killing cattle.

38:06.718 --> 38:07.550
It may be.

38:07.552 --> 38:10.654
It's funny you say that,
'cause...

38:10.656 --> 38:16.026
I was out here scouting deer and I
was going down that field right there.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.429
And, as I was going down
through there,

38:20.832 --> 38:21.631
I got a whiff of something.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.733
I mean, it was, whew!

38:23.735 --> 38:25.635
You know the smell of a
dead deer, right, am I right?

38:25.637 --> 38:26.936
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.505
In this 90-degree weather,
oh, yeah.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.906
[Travis] So,
I got out of my buggy,

38:29.908 --> 38:34.110
and I started over through
the weeds and I come upon

38:34.746 --> 38:36.980
- a dead cow.
- [Buck] Oh!

38:36.982 --> 38:39.082
[Travis] And,
when I walked around it,

38:39.351 --> 38:41.384
I was, like, "Holy [bleep]."

38:41.887 --> 38:43.053
Head's gone.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.854
- Son of a bitch!
- My gosh!

38:44.856 --> 38:46.323
[Travis] It was mutilated.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.758
I actually have a video of it,

38:48.760 --> 38:50.994
to give you guys a better
idea, if you all wanna see it.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.095
- You serious?
- Oh, yeah!

38:52.097 --> 38:52.495
Yes, yeah.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.230
Hell, yeah!

38:54.232 --> 38:58.034
<i>[Jeff] Travis says he has a video of
this cow that has its head ripped off.</i>

38:58.737 --> 38:59.436
We gotta see this.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.338
- Ready?
- Yeah.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.141
See the hay is still up.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.376
<i>[Bill] Yeah.</i>

39:10.949 --> 39:12.582
- Oh!
- Oh, damn!

39:12.584 --> 39:14.017
[Buck exclaims in surprise]

39:14.019 --> 39:17.120
- Cow-killing bastard!
- Holy [bleep]!

39:20.292 --> 39:22.325
See, you can
still see the socket,

39:23.028 --> 39:24.294
but the front half's gone.

39:24.296 --> 39:25.762
[exclaims in surprise]

39:25.764 --> 39:28.231
Something tore that
thing all to hell.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.899
Dislocated it
straight from the socket.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.068
<i>[Bill] Whatever
the hell's done that,</i>

39:32.070 --> 39:35.972
is gotta be one big
powerful son of a bitch.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.375
<i>[Jeff] We got a savage
predator out here.</i>

39:38.377 --> 39:39.943
<i>It's a meat-eating
son of a bitch.</i>

39:40.779 --> 39:43.680
<i>[Bill] You know what kinda power
it takes to do something like that?</i>

39:43.682 --> 39:45.448
<i>To an 800-pound cow?</i>

39:45.450 --> 39:47.450
Whatever bastard did this,

39:47.452 --> 39:51.454
he's been eating his damn
spinach, Popeye-style!

39:51.456 --> 39:53.990
Something's killing the deer
and ripping their heads off.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.893
Something's killing the cattle
and ripping their heads off.

39:56.895 --> 39:57.827
[men exclaiming in amazement]

39:57.829 --> 39:59.496
<i>[Travis] See that
fence line right there?</i>

39:59.498 --> 40:01.965
That's that fence line
right over there.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.933
- [Travis] Following down through there.
- [Buck] Yeah, yeah.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.936
How far at that fence line
was it?

40:06.938 --> 40:08.538
Well, you see where
that dead tree is?

40:08.540 --> 40:09.438
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.673
- Just right down that--
- [rumbling]

40:10.675 --> 40:11.808
[Buck] Oh, listen.

40:11.810 --> 40:12.942
[Bill] The hell's that?

40:12.944 --> 40:13.710
[rumbling]

40:13.712 --> 40:14.711
What is that?

40:15.914 --> 40:19.015
Sound like a damn
earthquake, isn't that?

40:20.118 --> 40:21.818
Coming from down
all the way there, ain't it?

40:21.820 --> 40:23.787
[rumbling continues]

40:23.789 --> 40:25.155
Sounds like
it's down in that holler.

40:25.157 --> 40:26.423
Yeah, it does.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.757
[Bill] The hell is it?

40:27.759 --> 40:29.926
We're standing there looking
at this video Travis has...

40:29.928 --> 40:32.395
It's like a big rumble
of some kind.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.798
And, all of a sudden, we
hear this noise down the holler.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.833
<i>I've never heard
anything like this.</i>

40:36.835 --> 40:38.535
-[rumbling continues]
-Listen to that. It's still going.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.437
<i>[Buck] It's a real low,
deep rumble,</i>

40:40.439 --> 40:42.505
<i>almost like the plates
in the Earth are shifting.</i>

40:42.507 --> 40:46.309
The only thing I can compare
this noise to, is an earthquake.

40:46.311 --> 40:48.778
And we haven't had an earthquake
in West Virginia in a long time.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.213
- [rumbling continues]
- Listen.

40:55.420 --> 40:56.151
[rumbling stops]

40:56.153 --> 40:57.353
It stopped.

40:59.491 --> 41:00.957
We heard that before.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.093
Bill was out on squatch watch,
came in on the farm,

41:04.095 --> 41:05.962
Huck and Willy and I were there,

41:05.964 --> 41:07.230
and that's what we heard.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.868
[rumbling]

41:11.870 --> 41:13.436
You hear that?

41:15.006 --> 41:17.907
That come from right over there, by
that big northern red oak right there.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.442
Guys, there's something
out there.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.511
What the hell could it be?

41:21.513 --> 41:23.780
Travis, you care if we go down
over there and take a look around?

41:23.782 --> 41:25.548
You guys are more than
welcome to do whatever you want.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.584
We need to find out
what that is.

41:27.586 --> 41:29.752
<i>[Bill] We wasn't planning
on going in these woods,</i>

41:29.754 --> 41:31.988
but after hearing
what we just heard,

41:31.990 --> 41:34.991
<i>we gonna grab our damn
weapons and our light,</i>

41:34.993 --> 41:35.992
and head the hell in there,

41:35.994 --> 41:38.595
because this is a damn
hot-ass lead, brother!

41:38.597 --> 41:40.263
- Thanks, brother, appreciate it, man.
- Thanks, Travis.

41:40.265 --> 41:44.734
By God, we're gonna find out what's
shaking these hills, here in Tygart Valley.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.870
- [Buck] Guys, let's get down there and check that out.
- [Travis] Thank you, guys.

41:46.872 --> 41:48.638
I can't tell you
what's coming next

41:48.640 --> 41:50.440
[Bill] I've never heard
nothing like that.

41:50.442 --> 41:51.975
<i>By God, I tell you one thing.</i>

41:51.977 --> 41:55.111
You better buckle the hell up,
for a hell of a ride.

41:55.113 --> 41:58.081
[Bill] What the hell
was that sound?

41:58.083 --> 41:59.182
[Buck] That sounded crazy.
