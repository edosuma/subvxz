00:08.921 --> 00:11.098
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.098 --> 00:12.403
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.403 --> 00:14.797
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:14.797 --> 00:16.755
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:16.755 --> 00:19.715
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:19.715 --> 00:21.717
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:25.112 --> 00:27.810
Excuse me.

00:27.810 --> 00:28.941
You're Nolan Price?

00:28.941 --> 00:30.856
Yes.
What can I do for you?

00:30.856 --> 00:32.119
You can let my
son out of jail.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.511
Stop pretending he's guilty.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.861
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I don't know who--

00:35.861 --> 00:37.080
My son is Troy Booker.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.908
He's been in Rikers
for 18 months

00:38.908 --> 00:40.388
for a crime he didn't commit.

00:40.388 --> 00:43.043
I've called you a dozen times.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.653
I know.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.090
It's not appropriate for me
to talk to you directly.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.918
Your son's lawyer
needs to be involved.

00:48.918 --> 00:51.225
But you should know that
we are reviewing the evidence,

00:51.225 --> 00:52.878
like we do in all cases,

00:52.878 --> 00:55.533
and if we believe the facts
don't support the charge,

00:55.533 --> 00:57.274
we will take
appropriate action.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.711
You've been hiding
behind that damn speech

00:59.711 --> 01:01.148
since he got arrested.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.714
- Ma'am.
- I--I suggest that you speak

01:02.714 --> 01:04.107
with your son's attorney.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.457
He's innocent.

01:06.457 --> 01:09.243
He was trying to help
that man who got shot.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.549
That's why he got blood
on his clothes.

01:11.549 --> 01:15.423
You're destroying
a good man's life!

01:15.423 --> 01:17.512
Ms. Frazier, I know
you're new to the case,

01:17.512 --> 01:20.341
but I've already ruled on the
defendant's motion to dismiss.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.777
Prior counsel
was ineffective,

01:21.777 --> 01:23.605
and as you'll see
in my brief, the facts

01:23.605 --> 01:26.086
are woefully insufficient
to support a murder two charge,

01:26.086 --> 01:27.130
let alone a conviction.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.436
That's why there's a trial--

01:28.436 --> 01:30.133
so the jury can
interpret the evidence.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.352
Don't get smug
with me, Price.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.093
I know how the system works.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.485
Trust me.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.444
This case was built on sand.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.315
But defense counsel
neglected to mention

01:38.315 --> 01:40.752
one other important piece
of information.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.320
The defendant actually
confessed to the murder.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.583
Which was coerced
and is therefore invalid.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.237
There is no evidence
of coercion.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.848
Okay, okay,
I've heard enough.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.546
Well, given the length
of time the defendant

01:51.546 --> 01:53.939
has been incarcerated,
and the fact that

01:53.939 --> 01:56.942
the actual trial isn't even
on the calendar yet,

01:56.942 --> 01:59.597
I want to hold an evidentiary
hearing to learn more

01:59.597 --> 02:02.426
about Mr. Booker's confession.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.688
Is your client here?

02:03.688 --> 02:05.864
No, he's apparently
still en route.

02:05.864 --> 02:07.518
Will you waive his presence?

02:07.518 --> 02:08.606
Yes.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.826
Mr. Price,
contact the detective

02:10.826 --> 02:11.957
who took the confession.

02:11.957 --> 02:13.829
Get him down here right away.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.531
Mr. Booker waived
his right to counsel

02:20.531 --> 02:23.143
and repeatedly stated
that he wanted to talk

02:23.143 --> 02:24.405
to clear up any confusion.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.189
But the more he talked,

02:26.189 --> 02:28.017
the more
he contradicted himself.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.279
How long did
you question him?

02:29.279 --> 02:30.628
Approximately two hours.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.587
And what led
to his confession?

02:32.587 --> 02:34.328
Mr. Booker had blood
on his shirt.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.808
That blood was eventually
tested and proven

02:36.808 --> 02:38.506
to belong to the victim.

02:38.506 --> 02:42.640
So after laying out all the
facts, Mr. Booker confessed?

02:42.640 --> 02:43.902
Yes, he did.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.730
I let him know that we
had an airtight case

02:45.730 --> 02:47.776
and that it would be
in his best interest

02:47.776 --> 02:49.081
to tell the truth.

02:49.081 --> 02:50.474
I told him if he did that,

02:50.474 --> 02:52.824
that he had a chance
at having a life.

02:52.824 --> 02:55.131
That maybe one day, he would
be released from prison.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.480
What then?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.221
He admitted that he
shot Marcus Williams.

03:04.314 --> 03:05.837
Courthouse is
going into lockdown.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.449
We have an attempted escape
down at prisoner intake.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.457
No, no, no, no, no!

03:18.850 --> 03:19.982
Wait.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.244
Where's the bus?
- They're on their way.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.245
- Handle that!
- Okay.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.377
Wheel him in! Wheel him in!

03:23.377 --> 03:24.552
Hey, hey. Look at me.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.162
All right, grab my hand.
Grab my hand.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.555
Stay here with me.
What happened?

03:27.555 --> 03:29.252
Who did this? Who did this?

03:29.252 --> 03:30.253
An inmate!

03:30.253 --> 03:31.689
What's his name?

03:31.689 --> 03:32.647
Troy Booker!

03:35.127 --> 03:38.218
Listen, where's that bus?

03:38.218 --> 03:41.221
Where's the bus?

04:26.701 --> 04:29.312
The Regional Fugitive
Task Force is now involved,

04:29.312 --> 04:31.096
but we are still running point.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.576
Any idea how he escaped?

04:32.576 --> 04:34.143
The transport vans
were backed up,

04:34.143 --> 04:36.406
so the CO brought
Booker out early

04:36.406 --> 04:37.494
before they got
into the sally port

04:37.494 --> 04:38.756
to try to move things along.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.758
I'm guessing Booker
grabbed the CO's weapon.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.717
The view is blocked by
the van from this camera,

04:42.717 --> 04:44.501
so we're waiting for the
footage from that one.

04:44.501 --> 04:45.894
We need to find out
what happened

04:45.894 --> 04:47.417
on the ride over here
from Rikers.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.114
Were there any other
inmates in the van?

04:49.114 --> 04:50.942
How about any other
corrections officers?

04:50.942 --> 04:52.988
See if Booker has any friends
in high places.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.859
Wouldn't be the first inmate
who got help from a CO.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.774
I already dug
into all of that.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.428
There was only one inmate
in the van, Booker.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.343
And as for friends
in high places,

05:00.343 --> 05:02.476
apparently, he was close
to one female CO.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.955
The warden said
she was recently punished

05:03.955 --> 05:05.479
for getting too close
to Booker.

05:05.479 --> 05:06.871
All right.
Is she over at Rikers?

05:06.871 --> 05:09.091
No.
She called in sick today.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.228
<i>I see an individual--</i>

05:16.228 --> 05:19.275
Black male, athletic build.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.929
- I can't tell.
- It could be him?

05:20.929 --> 05:21.973
Could be.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.067
- NYPD!
- Hands up!

05:29.067 --> 05:31.287
- What the hell?
- Hands above your head, Troy!

05:31.287 --> 05:32.462
My name isn't Troy!

05:32.462 --> 05:33.898
No, he's not lying.
It's not our guy.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.639
You damn right,
I ain't your guy.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.728
- Got any weapons on you?
- No.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.643
We're looking for an escaped
prisoner named Troy Booker.

05:39.643 --> 05:40.905
Put your hands down.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.080
Why the hell
you looking here?

05:42.080 --> 05:43.560
- Is Alana here?
- No.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.475
- Clear!
- I don't know where she is.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.347
She said she wasn't
feeling well.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.349
Place is clear.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.437
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

05:50.437 --> 05:51.655
You live here?

05:51.655 --> 05:53.004
I'm done answering
your questions.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.876
Get the hell out of here.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.487
We need to speak with Alana,
so we're not going anywhere.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.184
You don't have the right
to be here anyway.

05:59.184 --> 06:02.013
We're looking for a fugitive
who is armed and dangerous,

06:02.013 --> 06:03.841
who's already shot
one innocent person.

06:03.841 --> 06:06.366
So we have every right
to be here.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.889
Whoa, whoa. What happened?

06:07.889 --> 06:10.021
Has Alana ever talked
about this guy, Booker?

06:10.021 --> 06:11.762
She mentioned his name.

06:11.762 --> 06:14.722
She think he's being screwed,
you know, another white cop,

06:14.722 --> 06:16.288
innocent Black man thing.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.073
That is not in play here.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.204
If you say so.

06:19.204 --> 06:21.555
Detectives.

06:21.555 --> 06:24.035
- What the hell?
- Alana, I presume.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.516
We're here to talk about
your friend, Troy Booker.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.735
Why? What happened?

06:27.735 --> 06:30.085
He escaped custody.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.173
Good.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.175
I hope you never find him too.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.661
Troy Booker's a good man.

06:40.661 --> 06:41.792
Doesn't belong in jail,

06:41.792 --> 06:43.011
let alone a hellhole
like Rikers.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.621
What do you mean?

06:44.621 --> 06:46.971
Means Troy did what he had
to do, and I don't blame him.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.538
When's the last time
you talked to Booker?

06:48.538 --> 06:49.757
Yesterday.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.107
- He talk about escaping?
- No.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.717
And since then,
you've had no communication?

06:53.717 --> 06:55.415
No emails, no texts, no calls?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.546
No.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.113
So you really
expect us to believe

06:58.113 --> 06:59.680
you had nothing to do
with his escape?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.508
I'm telling the truth.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.901
That kid didn't kill anyone.
It's a bad case.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.207
And now he's sitting in jail

07:05.207 --> 07:06.861
day after day,
getting his ass kicked.

07:06.861 --> 07:11.518
He shot a coworker of yours,
a fellow officer, and escaped.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.563
We need to know
where he is right now.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.131
I said, I don't know.

07:17.306 --> 07:20.614
Alana, I arrested him
for that murder.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.485
And I heard him confess.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.531
It's on tape.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.142
So don't sit here right now
and tell me that he's innocent.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.405
If you know anything,
anything at all,

07:29.405 --> 07:30.885
you need to tell us right now,

07:30.885 --> 07:34.062
or we will bury your ass
for conspiracy and obstruction.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.500
Alana, don't be stupid.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.981
Don't throw your life away
for this kid, Booker.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.159
Okay.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.772
I got a call from him
this morning after he escaped.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.382
He wanted money.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.558
And?

07:51.558 --> 07:53.255
I agreed.
I said I'd help him out.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.735
Did you two connect?

07:54.735 --> 07:57.085
No.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.390
We were supposed
to meet up at noon.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.566
Where?

08:11.969 --> 08:13.449
End of the hall, last door.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.459
NYPD! Police!

08:23.459 --> 08:25.113
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hands up!

08:25.113 --> 08:26.549
Put your hands
behind your head!

08:26.549 --> 08:28.551
Or what?
You gonna shoot me, white boy?

08:28.551 --> 08:30.292
Huh? That's it?

08:30.292 --> 08:32.163
That's not our guy.
Not our guy, Frank.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.513
Okay, listen to me.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.340
We're looking
for your brother.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.473
If he's in the apartment,
tell us right now.

08:37.473 --> 08:38.735
Clear!

08:38.735 --> 08:40.128
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.739
- All clear.
- See? Clear.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.045
Now get the hell out
of here, all right?

08:44.045 --> 08:45.046
You got any weapons
in the house?

08:45.046 --> 08:46.613
- No.
- Put your hands down.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.092
When's the last time
you talked to Troy?

08:48.092 --> 08:49.267
I don't recall.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.748
Yo, yo, what the hell
are you doing?

08:53.533 --> 08:57.058
Four cheeseburgers, four
large fries, two milkshakes.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.407
It's a lot of food for one guy.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.148
Yeah, well, I was hungry.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.324
I bet he was too.
Where is he?

09:02.324 --> 09:03.978
Look, I ain't seen
a damn thing.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.457
So you might as well just
walk the hell on out of here,

09:05.457 --> 09:08.069
all right?
- Shaw, I got blood.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.551
We're not going anywhere.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.726
Sit down!

09:15.772 --> 09:17.121
Unless you start cooperating,

09:17.121 --> 09:18.601
we're gonna arrest
your ass too.

09:18.601 --> 09:19.907
For what?

09:19.907 --> 09:21.169
Aiding and abetting,
hindering prosecution,

09:21.169 --> 09:22.474
that's for what!

09:22.474 --> 09:25.173
All right, well,
do what you got to do.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.696
Take him down to the 2-7.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.612
Get up.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.529
Put your hands
behind your back.

09:33.529 --> 09:37.359
Yeah, well, I hope you
proud of yourself, brother.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.971
2-7 Squad to Central,

09:40.971 --> 09:43.234
perp is no longer
in the residence.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.585
Be advised,
he's armed and dangerous.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.586
Check it out.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.284
Well, he was definitely here.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.025
Food was bought at 11:42.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.026
It's now 12:03.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.288
We just missed him.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.683
Yeah, okay, got it.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.859
Booker was just at his
brother's apartment

09:58.859 --> 10:02.036
over in Bushwick on the corner
of Wilson and Halsey.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.777
So he's got to be close by.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.388
Let's send out a BOLO
and see if RTCC

10:06.388 --> 10:08.564
has any videos from street cams

10:08.564 --> 10:10.392
or traffic cams
in the general area.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.220
On it.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.265
Hey, this is
Lieutenant Dixon.

10:14.265 --> 10:17.051
I want a level three
mobilization set up

10:17.051 --> 10:20.750
in the vicinity of Wilson
and Halsey Streets in Brooklyn.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.666
Send out all available SRGs.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.582
We need to set up a containment
within a half-mile radius.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.019
I want that area
covered in blue.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.455
RTCC got a hit.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.588
Booking's heading east
on Cooper Street.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.423
2-7 Squad to Central.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.599
Got eyes on the target.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.688
North side of Cooper Street,
mid-block.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.472
Black jacket,
black baseball cap.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.479
10-13, in pursuit of suspect!

10:58.135 --> 11:01.748
Move! Move! Move! Move!

11:10.147 --> 11:13.281
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

11:17.328 --> 11:19.461
- Down! It's over, Booker!
- Stay down.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.463
- Hey, stay down!
- Put that gun down!

11:21.463 --> 11:23.291
Hey, hey, hey! Don't do this!

11:23.291 --> 11:24.422
- Ah! Help me!
- Don't do it!

11:24.422 --> 11:26.250
- Put that gun down!
- No, no, no!

11:26.250 --> 11:27.643
Back up or I'll shoot!

11:27.643 --> 11:29.645
Let her go. Let her go.
Do not escalate this.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.690
Let her go.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.997
Shots fired.
Suspect has a hostage.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.308
Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no, no, no.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.223
We'll set up a containment.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.833
We'll reason with him.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.530
Ease down.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.978
Looks like our best shot
is through the front window.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.283
Okay.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.285
I'll let you know
when we're in position.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.722
Hey.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.288
I got a hostage negotiator
on the way.

12:04.288 --> 12:07.465
We don't need that.
I can talk to him.

12:07.465 --> 12:08.553
What are you talking about?

12:08.553 --> 12:10.773
I know him.
Well, sort of.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.428
I arrested him.
I took his confession.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.170
And you think that that makes
you qualified to handle this?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.519
No, I'm not saying
that makes me qualified,

12:17.519 --> 12:20.261
but I'm saying I connected
with Booker before.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.958
I got him to confess.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.917
But I'm saying he knows me.
He's seen me before.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.093
The longer we wait to engage,
the greater the risk.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.138
Hostage negotiator
isn't even on site.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.139
Jalen is.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.100
Okay.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.971
Let's give it a shot.
- Thank you.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.887
Hey, I finally got access
to video of the actual escape.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.628
Thought it might be helpful.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.944
Wait, that gun is in
the guard's hand.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.208
Yeah, thanks. That helps.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.255
I need a throw phone!

13:08.875 --> 13:10.790
Don't you even think
about coming in here,

13:10.790 --> 13:13.749
or I'll shoot everybody
in this damn place!

13:13.749 --> 13:15.969
Don't hurt us.
Please, I have three children!

13:15.969 --> 13:17.274
Stop. Stop talking.
Stop talking.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.798
Just do what I say.
Understand me?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.888
Please don't shoot me!

13:24.412 --> 13:26.544
Go. Go.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.416
Pick it up.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.332
Pick up the phone!
Pick up the phone!

13:34.291 --> 13:36.032
Give it to me.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.209
Hello?

13:39.209 --> 13:41.603
Troy, this is Detective Shaw.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.300
Remember me?
- Yes.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.650
<i>I want you to listen
to me closely.</i>

13:45.650 --> 13:47.652
You need to let
these hostages go.

13:47.652 --> 13:51.352
<i>If you do that, there's still
a way out of this.</i>

13:51.352 --> 13:52.919
<i>There's some good news.</i>

13:52.919 --> 13:55.835
The corrections officer that
you shot, he's still alive.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.314
We got the video.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.621
So we know that you two were
wrestling over the weapon,

13:59.621 --> 14:01.753
and he's the one who
actually pulled the trigger.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.494
<i>So that's good news too.</i>

14:03.494 --> 14:05.366
<i>But you got to let
these people go, Troy.</i>

14:05.366 --> 14:08.369
You do that, you can tell
your side of the story.

14:08.369 --> 14:12.416
I've been trying to explain
myself for the last 18 months.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.897
<i>I didn't kill him.</i>

14:14.897 --> 14:17.857
I saw the real killer.
I was there at the scene.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.249
I'm trying to help
the dude who got shot.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.512
<i>That's why I have blood
on my clothes!</i>

14:21.512 --> 14:22.600
'Cause I tried to save his ass,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.602
but nobody wants to hear
any of that.

14:24.602 --> 14:25.908
<i>Tell it to the jury.</i>

14:25.908 --> 14:27.127
<i>That's what trials
are for, Troy.</i>

14:27.127 --> 14:29.042
You have to believe
in the system.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.479
Believe in the system--
are you serious?

14:31.479 --> 14:34.003
The system's the thing
that's trying to kill me.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.527
No, I'm not going
back to Rikers!

14:40.618 --> 14:41.924
Go, Frank.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.578
Radios off.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.640
You lied to me, Shaw.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.207
<i>You played me.</i>

15:04.207 --> 15:06.253
You got me to confess
to something I didn't do.

15:06.253 --> 15:10.126
Tell it to the jury,
and let them hear your truth.

15:10.126 --> 15:12.259
And I sure as hell ain't
believing in no system!

15:12.259 --> 15:13.956
It ain't--it ain't built
for people like me!

15:13.956 --> 15:15.392
You know it, and I know it!

15:15.392 --> 15:16.741
<i>But you got to let
these people go, Troy.</i>

15:16.741 --> 15:18.656
<i>If you're as innocent
as you say you are,</i>

15:18.656 --> 15:19.962
why make this worse?

15:25.794 --> 15:30.016
<i>Troy, now listen to me.</i>

15:30.016 --> 15:31.017
<i>You can tell your side
of the story</i>

15:31.017 --> 15:32.844
<i>if you get out of here.</i>

15:32.844 --> 15:33.976
<i>You understand
what I'm, saying?</i>

15:33.976 --> 15:36.109
<i>You cannot hurt these people.</i>

15:36.109 --> 15:38.285
I need a car right now,

15:38.285 --> 15:40.026
or one of these innocent people
you keep talking about

15:40.026 --> 15:42.202
is gonna get shot, you hear me?

15:42.202 --> 15:43.986
<i>That is a very bad idea.</i>

15:43.986 --> 15:46.989
You do that,
you cannot walk this back.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.556
<i>You can't come back from this.</i>

15:50.645 --> 15:51.994
<i>Come on, brother,</i>

15:51.994 --> 15:53.604
<i>you got the rest of your life
ahead of you.</i>

15:55.606 --> 15:56.868
Drop the gun.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.873
Troy.
- Get off me!

16:01.873 --> 16:04.833
Drop the gun,
or I swear to God...

16:04.833 --> 16:06.400
<i>If you don't drop that gun--</i>

16:06.400 --> 16:07.618
Come on, brother.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.229
<i>Just put it down.</i>

16:09.229 --> 16:11.013
Drop it!

16:13.711 --> 16:15.409
<i>I got Booker in custody.</i>

16:21.284 --> 16:23.852
The defendant stands accused
in two separate

16:23.852 --> 16:27.377
but related cases--
murder and escape, kidnapping,

16:27.377 --> 16:29.031
and assault
of a corrections officer.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.251
The People are
seeking consolidation?

16:31.251 --> 16:34.080
The two cases stemmed from
the same criminal transaction.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.256
The escape and assault
never would have happened

16:36.256 --> 16:37.953
but for the underlying murder.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.955
Therefore, we should
only have one trial.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.044
Before you consider
joining the cases,

16:42.044 --> 16:43.741
I'd like the opportunity
to argue a motion

16:43.741 --> 16:45.091
to dismiss the murder case.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.049
Well, we've already
been down that road twice.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.920
But I have newly
discovered evidence.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.053
The defendant forfeited
the right to further argument

16:51.053 --> 16:53.186
when he chose
to escape from custody.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.752
I agree.

16:54.752 --> 16:58.104
Any additional issues can
be visited during the trial.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.455
I'm granting the People's
application to consolidate.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.978
My client has been
waiting 18 months

17:02.978 --> 17:06.112
for his day in court,
18 months.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.505
And I now have
unassailable evidence

17:08.505 --> 17:09.985
that will exonerate him.

17:09.985 --> 17:12.596
Case is scheduled
for trial next Wednesday.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.659
Mr. Price.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.270
Everyone in my office
tells me that

17:34.270 --> 17:36.620
you're a man of integrity,
that you'll listen to reason.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.448
The judge made his ruling.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.841
If you think that
he made an error of law,

17:39.841 --> 17:43.149
he can file an appeal.
- Wait.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.629
We all know this is
my first murder case,

17:45.629 --> 17:47.849
and it's clear that you think
that I'm naive

17:47.849 --> 17:49.894
for believing in my client.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.810
There is a serious injustice
going on here.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.639
Please, just hear me out.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.685
What is that?

17:57.685 --> 17:59.904
Definitive proof
that my client

17:59.904 --> 18:01.297
didn't commit the murder.

18:01.297 --> 18:04.387
And you've been sitting
on this for 18 months?

18:04.387 --> 18:06.172
No, no, of course not.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.695
I got it a few days ago.

18:07.695 --> 18:08.870
Watch the video.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.176
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.743
You'll see that
you arrested the wrong man.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.615
Just take a look.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.794
A man's life is on the line.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.148
<i>Oh, man, check it out.</i>

18:26.148 --> 18:27.541
<i>Now they gonna
take it outside.</i>

18:27.541 --> 18:28.890
<i>This is crazy.</i>

18:28.890 --> 18:30.457
<i>These guys have been going
all night.</i>

18:30.457 --> 18:33.068
<i>Watch this. Whoa!</i>

18:33.068 --> 18:34.417
<i>This is good footage right--</i>

18:34.417 --> 18:37.638
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

18:37.638 --> 18:39.205
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

18:39.205 --> 18:43.905
<i>I need some help!</i>

18:43.905 --> 18:47.082
That's why Booker
had blood on his clothes.

18:47.082 --> 18:50.912
Booker told me
that he saw the shooter.

18:52.479 --> 18:55.612
And then he came back
to render aid to the victim.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.486
And I just--
I just figured he was lying,

18:59.486 --> 19:01.792
you know,
just trying to explain

19:01.792 --> 19:03.577
why he had blood
on his clothes.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.804
I don't lie
to get a confession.

19:13.804 --> 19:16.155
That's not what this is.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.765
Look, I just laid out
the evidence

19:17.765 --> 19:19.201
that was in front of him,

19:19.201 --> 19:21.682
and I told him
to tell the truth.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.684
You know, I just wanted him
to know what he was facing.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.468
This kid is--

19:25.468 --> 19:27.427
People make false confessions
all the time.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.255
Not to me.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.821
Defense lawyer said he smoked
pot on the night in question.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.301
No. No, no, no, no.

19:32.301 --> 19:36.175
He did not seem high
or intoxicated to me.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.264
And if he had,
I wouldn't have--

19:41.267 --> 19:44.008
Where do we go from here?

19:44.008 --> 19:45.793
I'll dismiss
the murder charge.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.273
And the escape case?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.449
I'm gonna check with a
corrections officer right now,

19:49.449 --> 19:51.320
see how he feels about a plea.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.669
Good.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.715
I'll come with you.

20:10.687 --> 20:11.949
Mrs. Foster.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.647
This is ADA Price,

20:13.647 --> 20:15.431
and I'm Detective Shaw.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.390
I'd like to have a word with
your husband if that's okay.

20:19.827 --> 20:20.828
He's gone.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.525
What do you mean?

20:22.525 --> 20:23.874
He died.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.835
I'm very sorry
to hear that, ma'am.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.838
We were told
he was doing well.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.492
He was gonna make
a full recovery.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.581
His wound got infected.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.452
He went into septic shock.

20:38.411 --> 20:41.240
Now I'm gonna
have to tell my kids.

20:53.382 --> 20:56.298
Randall Foster
would still be alive

20:56.298 --> 20:59.910
if we hadn't
wrongly incarcerated Booker,

20:59.910 --> 21:03.349
if I had responded
to his mother's phone calls,

21:03.349 --> 21:07.266
if I had dug deeper
into her claims of innocence.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.225
You can't beat yourself up
over this.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.531
It's not your fault.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.882
Right now,
the issue on the table is,

21:14.882 --> 21:17.624
what do we do about Booker?

21:17.624 --> 21:21.323
What's the appropriate charge?

21:21.323 --> 21:24.979
We charge him
with murder two.

21:24.979 --> 21:26.415
Nolan?

21:26.415 --> 21:30.550
Uh, Booker never intended
to kill anybody.

21:30.550 --> 21:33.030
He and Foster were fighting
to gain control of the gun.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.946
The actual bullet wound
wasn't even life threatening.

21:35.946 --> 21:39.820
The CO ultimately died
of the secondary infection.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.604
Irrelevant.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.607
Legally, yes, but morally?

21:44.607 --> 21:46.522
Ethically?

21:46.522 --> 21:48.742
Shouldn't we at least
consider man one?

21:48.742 --> 21:53.529
We can't reward Booker
because he tried to escape,

21:53.529 --> 21:55.444
regardless of his innocence.

21:57.011 --> 22:01.058
Should have waited for the
process to play itself out.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.583
- I get it, but--
- But what?

22:03.583 --> 22:07.543
But the system failed him
over and over again.

22:07.543 --> 22:10.154
So why on Earth
should we punish him

22:10.154 --> 22:14.333
for not believing in something
that he had no credible basis

22:14.333 --> 22:16.900
to believe in?

22:16.900 --> 22:21.731
I understand you're feeling
guilty about what happened.

22:21.731 --> 22:24.821
But you can't let that
drive your decision.

22:28.956 --> 22:31.524
Okay.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.483
So we're charging
him with murder two?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.975
The day started out
like any other workday

22:47.975 --> 22:49.498
for Randall Foster.

22:49.498 --> 22:53.415
He had breakfast, kissed his
wife and children goodbye,

22:53.415 --> 22:57.158
and went to Rikers Island.

22:57.158 --> 23:01.292
One of his assignments
was to drive an inmate,

23:01.292 --> 23:05.340
uh, the defendant,
to the courthouse

23:05.340 --> 23:07.951
for pretrial hearing.

23:07.951 --> 23:12.303
Problem is, the defendant had
something different in mind.

23:12.303 --> 23:17.613
He was planning to overpower
Randall Foster and escape.

23:17.613 --> 23:22.662
The People readily admit
the defendant had reason

23:22.662 --> 23:26.100
to be impatient with the way
his case was progressing,

23:26.100 --> 23:31.540
but instead of following
the lawful path to innocence,

23:31.540 --> 23:34.456
he chose to take matters
into his own hands.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.677
And that's why
we're all here today.

23:37.677 --> 23:40.636
Randall Foster is dead.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.421
His wife is a widow.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.728
His son and daughter

23:45.728 --> 23:48.731
will grow up
without their father.

23:48.731 --> 23:51.821
At the conclusion
of this trial, I will ask you

23:51.821 --> 23:56.043
to find the defendant
guilty of murder.

23:58.698 --> 24:00.700
That was a compelling
little yarn

24:00.700 --> 24:03.398
Mr. Price just wove, wasn't it?

24:04.747 --> 24:09.448
An innocent man in Rikers,
he chose to escape

24:09.448 --> 24:11.580
rather than go to trial.

24:11.580 --> 24:15.192
And as such, he must suffer
the consequences

24:15.192 --> 24:17.368
of his unlawful actions.

24:17.368 --> 24:22.504
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
not here because of Mr. Booker.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.160
We're here
because of Mr. Price.

24:28.771 --> 24:31.905
He held my client without bail.

24:31.905 --> 24:37.519
He sent him to Rikers,
where he sat for 18 months.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.608
Troy Booker never should
have been arrested,

24:39.608 --> 24:40.870
let alone charged.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.699
He was innocent,
and yet Mr. Price

24:43.699 --> 24:46.528
was ready to send him
to prison for life,

24:46.528 --> 24:49.749
just another
disposable Black man.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.884
My client did not
kill Randall Foster.

24:54.884 --> 24:58.714
The system killed
Randall Foster.

24:58.714 --> 25:01.543
So if you want
to blame someone,

25:01.543 --> 25:05.504
blame Mr. Price
and his colleagues

25:05.504 --> 25:07.375
at the New York
Police Department.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.769
They're the criminals.

25:09.769 --> 25:12.554
They're the ones
who should be locked up.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.964
Detective Shaw,
did you obtain that video

25:30.964 --> 25:32.792
from the courthouse
security cameras?

25:32.792 --> 25:33.967
I did.

25:33.967 --> 25:36.535
Was it edited
or altered in any way?

25:36.535 --> 25:37.840
No, it was not.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.450
Your Honor, we'll stipulate
to the video

25:39.450 --> 25:41.452
and its authenticity.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.106
Mr. Price.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.676
The People accept
the stipulation.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.243
All right,
I'll enter it into evidence

25:49.243 --> 25:51.550
as People's Exhibit 7.

25:55.075 --> 25:58.818
What happened
after the defendant escaped?

25:58.818 --> 26:02.299
The citywide alert,
an armed escaped prisoner.

26:02.299 --> 26:04.606
The defense will also
stipulate to the fact

26:04.606 --> 26:07.566
that Mr. Booker fled
and that he took hostages

26:07.566 --> 26:09.002
and was captured.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.484
I thought the defense
was gonna have

26:13.484 --> 26:14.877
a field day with Shaw.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.662
He's the one who took
the false confession.

26:16.662 --> 26:19.447
I'm sure Detective Shaw
was relieved.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.231
Maybe, but I'm not.

26:21.231 --> 26:22.755
Why is that?

26:22.755 --> 26:24.800
I don't understand why
the defense lawyer didn't

26:24.800 --> 26:27.673
challenge the veracity of
the video or harp on the fact

26:27.673 --> 26:30.153
that Booker never pointed
the gun at the guard.

26:30.153 --> 26:33.113
She can argue that
during her summation.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.028
No, no,
it's a missed opportunity.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.552
She could easily have
pecked away at our evidence

26:37.552 --> 26:39.119
and undermined our case.

26:39.119 --> 26:41.991
It sounds like you're worried
you might win.

26:43.863 --> 26:46.996
You did nothing wrong, Nolan.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.346
The truth would have
come out eventually.

26:49.346 --> 26:50.826
You're right,

26:50.826 --> 26:52.828
but eventually
took too damn long,

26:52.828 --> 26:56.615
and now Randall Foster is dead.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.746
I understand.

27:00.183 --> 27:05.188
Elements of this case are
highly unusual and troubling.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.670
We act on the facts
as presented.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.542
And Randall Foster is dead

27:11.542 --> 27:14.067
because the defendant
tried to escape.

27:14.067 --> 27:18.680
That's felony murder
all day long.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.595
So...

27:22.945 --> 27:24.817
Make peace with the past.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.689
And get your head
into the game.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.908
Understand?

27:32.563 --> 27:35.479
You know why the defense
didn't attack your evidence?

27:35.479 --> 27:37.351
The facts are on your side.

27:37.351 --> 27:40.659
So they're trying to win
on emotion, not the law.

27:42.486 --> 27:45.228
You need to deliver

27:45.228 --> 27:47.404
an emotional gut punch
of your own.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.111
<i>He was a good man.</i>

28:00.156 --> 28:05.727
Hardworking, loved spending
time with his family.

28:05.727 --> 28:08.817
And believe it or not,
he really liked his job.

28:08.817 --> 28:11.733
He felt like he was helping
keep the world safe.

28:11.733 --> 28:14.214
Did he receive any
awards or commendations?

28:14.214 --> 28:15.737
Yes, one.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.913
He saved a prisoner's life.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.699
Gave him CPR
in the transport van.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.310
Thank you.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.659
Nothing further.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.795
He loved his job.

28:29.795 --> 28:33.102
Have you ever been to Rikers?

28:33.102 --> 28:34.582
No, I haven't.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.237
Then you've never been
crammed into the intake center

28:37.237 --> 28:39.848
for hours next to men forced
to sit in their own feces.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.110
- Objection.
- Sustained.

28:41.110 --> 28:44.418
Never tasted the spoiled,
moldy food.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.767
- Objection.
- Sustained.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.030
Never been thrown in a cage
and hosed down

28:48.030 --> 28:50.293
with decontamination chemicals.

28:50.293 --> 28:54.123
Your Honor, this entire line
of questioning is improper.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.734
I agree.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.344
Move on, Ms. Frazier.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.347
You spoke of your husband.

29:03.002 --> 29:06.614
I am sorry for your loss.

29:06.614 --> 29:07.789
Thank you.

29:11.184 --> 29:14.187
And while you believe
that he was a good man,

29:14.187 --> 29:18.147
it's clear that he was a part
of a broken and corrupt system,

29:18.147 --> 29:21.107
a system that was depriving
an innocent man

29:21.107 --> 29:23.109
of his constitutional rights
to liberty

29:23.109 --> 29:24.284
and the pursuit of happiness.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.416
Are we within a mile
of a question?

29:26.416 --> 29:27.809
Ask a relevant question,

29:27.809 --> 29:30.377
or this cross-examination
is over.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.643
Did you know that
your husband didn't die

29:35.643 --> 29:37.166
from a gunshot wound?

29:37.166 --> 29:39.212
He died from poor medical care?

29:39.212 --> 29:40.517
Objection.

29:40.517 --> 29:41.605
No foundation.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.868
Sustained.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.435
Okay, Ms. Frazier,
we're done here.

29:49.570 --> 29:52.007
Mr. Price, anything else?

29:52.007 --> 29:53.704
No, the People rest.

29:53.704 --> 29:54.836
Ms. Frazier.

29:54.836 --> 29:57.230
The defense
calls Troy Booker.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.105
I've never really
been in trouble

30:03.105 --> 30:05.542
for anything serious before.

30:05.542 --> 30:09.895
You were arrested once
for a driving offense?

30:09.895 --> 30:12.680
Driving while Black.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.292
They pulled me over for not
using a right turn signal.

30:16.292 --> 30:18.468
Me and half the Black men
in America.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.166
Objection.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.471
Sustained.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.952
The car was uninsured,
and so they arrested me,

30:23.952 --> 30:26.563
and was in jail for three days.

30:26.563 --> 30:30.263
And a few months later,
you were arrested for murder.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.830
Yes.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.311
Why did you confess
if you didn't do it?

30:35.311 --> 30:39.185
That's a hell of a question.

30:39.185 --> 30:42.275
I ask myself that every day.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.799
I was young.

30:44.799 --> 30:46.975
And right before
Detective Shaw arrested me,

30:46.975 --> 30:53.112
I had smoked a joint
and was real high, you know.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.550
Shaw, he's smooth.

30:56.550 --> 30:59.466
He told me that all the
evidence pointed to me,

30:59.466 --> 31:01.468
and that the only way
that I could help myself

31:01.468 --> 31:02.948
was to confess.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.429
So I did.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.345
Why'd you escape?

31:09.345 --> 31:12.783
Why'd you grab
Officer Foster's gun?

31:12.783 --> 31:14.742
- Self-defense.
- Objection.

31:14.742 --> 31:17.266
There's no evidence Mr. Foster
tried to harm the defendant.

31:17.266 --> 31:19.094
In fact, we already
presented video

31:19.094 --> 31:20.748
that showed the defendant committing

31:20.748 --> 31:23.142
an unprovoked attack
on Mr. Foster.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.274
I'm not talking about Foster.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.624
Then who are you
talking about?

31:27.624 --> 31:29.235
Who was attacking you?

31:30.845 --> 31:32.194
An inmate.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.415
A white supremacist.

31:35.415 --> 31:39.332
Tell the jury what he did,
what he said.

31:40.986 --> 31:44.163
The day before I broke out,

31:44.163 --> 31:47.818
he gave me a beat down,

31:47.818 --> 31:50.647
told me that he would kill me

31:50.647 --> 31:52.432
the next time he saw me.

31:52.432 --> 31:56.392
And so, when I was in the van
and I saw an opportunity

31:56.392 --> 31:59.743
to escape, I did.

31:59.743 --> 32:04.357
Either way, I would have died
the next day in Rikers.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.016
What would you have done?

32:12.800 --> 32:15.324
Would you have
just surrendered,

32:15.324 --> 32:18.284
accepted your fate,
or would you have done

32:18.284 --> 32:22.070
whatever you could to escape
to fight for your life,

32:22.070 --> 32:23.245
for your freedom?

32:23.245 --> 32:25.508
Objection.
He's giving a speech.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.423
Sustained.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.514
Nothing further.

32:31.514 --> 32:32.863
We're adjourned.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.915
This jury wants
to let Booker go free

32:40.915 --> 32:43.570
and send me to Rikers
in his place.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.268
I think you're right.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.968
May be time to offer a plea.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.408
Okay.
What are you offering?

32:58.237 --> 33:01.936
Man one, 15 years.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.680
15 years?

33:06.680 --> 33:09.813
If it's good behavior,
you'll be out in 12.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.206
A hell of a lot better
than life.

33:11.206 --> 33:13.078
My client doesn't
belong in prison.

33:13.078 --> 33:16.211
Let's not forget
the defendant killed a man.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.300
Under the law,
that's felony murder.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.041
If my client stayed
in Rikers one more day,

33:20.041 --> 33:21.390
he would have been murdered.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.610
Manslaughter
is the best I can do.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.223
Who the hell
do you think you are?

33:28.223 --> 33:29.224
Hmm?

33:32.227 --> 33:34.577
Acting like you're
doing me a favor

33:34.577 --> 33:37.798
or offering me
some kind of deal?

33:37.798 --> 33:39.626
I'm--I'm--I'm innocent.

33:39.626 --> 33:42.063
I wasn't supposed to be
in Rikers in the first place!

33:42.063 --> 33:44.326
You made me attack that CO!

33:47.416 --> 33:52.378
I'm not going back
to that place for 12 years.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.466
No way.

33:55.294 --> 33:58.775
And I may not be perfect,
but I have people that love me.

33:58.775 --> 34:02.692
And there are things that
I want to do in my life.

34:05.391 --> 34:10.613
So you can take your plea deal
and shove it up your ass.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.066
There's got to be
something else you can do,

34:28.066 --> 34:29.719
but maybe offer a better plea.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.156
I offered manslaughter.
He wasn't interested.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.679
What about
involuntary manslaughter?

34:32.679 --> 34:34.550
He killed a
corrections officer

34:34.550 --> 34:36.900
with a wife and two children.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.033
But he's claiming that
his life was in jeopardy,

34:39.033 --> 34:40.556
that if he returned to Rikers,

34:40.556 --> 34:41.731
that he'd be killed
in the morning.

34:41.731 --> 34:42.906
That's gotta count
for something!

34:42.906 --> 34:43.951
I agree--that's why I offered

34:43.951 --> 34:44.952
to plead him out
to manslaughter.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.649
I understand the law.

34:46.649 --> 34:48.347
We have to face it.
We failed him.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.696
I get it, I do, but--

34:49.696 --> 34:52.177
There's no buts here, Nolan.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.221
We failed him.

34:53.221 --> 34:54.222
We owe him.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.488
I'll contact Rikers.

34:59.488 --> 35:01.099
No guarantees, of course.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.720
How's it going?
- I just spoke with the warden.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.504
He went through his logs,

35:15.504 --> 35:18.116
scrubbed all the surveillance
video he could find.

35:18.116 --> 35:18.986
And?

35:31.216 --> 35:34.567
I looked at every piece
of video we have.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.264
This is the only time
Mr. Booker

35:36.264 --> 35:38.571
was outside of his cell

35:38.571 --> 35:40.486
on the day in question.

35:40.486 --> 35:41.704
The only time?

35:41.704 --> 35:43.097
Correct.

35:43.097 --> 35:46.883
He ate breakfast and lunch
in his cell that day.

35:46.883 --> 35:50.844
So you didn't find any video
or other evidence

35:50.844 --> 35:53.934
suggesting that
a white inmate attacked

35:53.934 --> 35:57.111
or threatened
the defendant that day?

35:57.111 --> 35:59.809
Correct.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.202
Thank you.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.948
You're the man
in charge of the jail.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.254
Is that fair to say?

36:10.777 --> 36:12.474
I am.

36:12.474 --> 36:16.130
16 people died in your
custody last year, correct?

36:17.479 --> 36:20.439
We do the best we can.

36:20.439 --> 36:23.833
But we have limited resources,
limited manpower,

36:23.833 --> 36:26.314
limited funds.

36:26.314 --> 36:30.666
Must be awful to be
an inmate in there,

36:30.666 --> 36:33.103
let alone an innocent inmate,

36:33.103 --> 36:35.497
someone who did
absolutely nothing wrong.

36:35.497 --> 36:36.933
- Objection.
- Sustained.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.109
Move on, Ms. Frazier.

36:41.416 --> 36:42.722
Nothing further.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.250
Did Mr. Booker
have access to a phone?

36:49.250 --> 36:50.295
All prisoners do.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.645
Did his lawyer visit?

36:52.645 --> 36:53.994
Several times.

36:53.994 --> 36:56.301
So he had a lawful way

36:56.301 --> 36:59.739
of challenging
his custody status.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.175
He did.

37:01.175 --> 37:06.180
Alternatives to killing
a guard and escaping.

37:07.703 --> 37:08.878
Yes, sir.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.539
Thank you.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.171
You following me?

37:41.171 --> 37:42.260
Well...

37:47.700 --> 37:49.049
So what now?

37:49.049 --> 37:50.703
We finish the trial.

37:50.703 --> 37:52.705
He didn't deserve to be there
in the first place, Nolan.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.054
I know.

37:55.490 --> 37:59.320
There's just nothing we can do
about that, not now.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.235
- What can I get you?
- I'm good. Thank you.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.284
We need to move past all that.

38:10.070 --> 38:13.813
Move past all that?

38:16.816 --> 38:17.947
How?

38:19.949 --> 38:23.518
We ruined this man's life.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.303
That doesn't bother you?
That doesn't get to you?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.695
That doesn't affect you at all?

38:26.695 --> 38:28.480
- Yeah, of course it does.
- Doesn't seem like it.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.133
That's not fair.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.746
I have a job to do.

38:33.746 --> 38:36.923
And wearing my guilt
on my sleeve

38:36.923 --> 38:40.927
or giving speeches
about life's inequities

38:40.927 --> 38:42.537
isn't gonna help anybody.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.414
You know,
I thought I could help people

38:49.414 --> 38:52.591
by going to law school,

38:52.591 --> 38:54.810
fight the system that way.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.988
It didn't work out for me
the way I thought.

39:01.774 --> 39:04.211
So I joined the Police Academy.

39:05.691 --> 39:11.261
You know, I thought I could
do more good on the streets,

39:11.261 --> 39:14.352
have more of a direct impact.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.529
I became a cop...

39:17.529 --> 39:20.923
to keep innocent Black men
out of prison,

39:20.923 --> 39:23.404
not put them in there.

39:23.404 --> 39:26.755
No matter how hard
we all try,

39:26.755 --> 39:30.150
every once in a while,
we get it wrong.

39:32.718 --> 39:34.546
It's just the way it is.

39:36.852 --> 39:40.160
That's a hell of a speech,

39:40.160 --> 39:42.380
unless your name
is Troy Booker.

39:55.871 --> 39:58.047
Counsel, please rise.

40:06.752 --> 40:09.929
Madam Foreperson, have you
agreed upon a verdict?

40:09.929 --> 40:13.019
We find the defendant,
Troy Booker,

40:13.019 --> 40:14.803
guilty of murder
in the second degree.

40:14.803 --> 40:17.502
That's okay. It's okay.

40:17.502 --> 40:20.156
Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

40:20.156 --> 40:22.637
We're adjourned.
