WEBVTT

00:01.208 --> 00:02.291
[theme music playing]

01:11.083 --> 01:13.750
[Moira]
You seem to be
over the nightmares, Morph.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.500
And there's not a thing wrong
with you physically.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.833
But I'm worried.

01:17.833 --> 01:19.458
You were in bad shape.

01:20.166 --> 01:22.875
You're talking aboutgoing back
to a hard life.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.875
You know there's more
to being an X-Man

01:25.875 --> 01:27.708
than getting
a good night's sleep.

01:27.708 --> 01:29.875
What? Like blue fur?

01:30.458 --> 01:32.000
Or designer eyewear?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.500
[chuckles]

01:33.500 --> 01:34.708
All right.

01:34.708 --> 01:36.291
You know I cannot keep you

01:36.291 --> 01:38.250
if you're determined to go.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.416
Just take it easy at first.

01:41.416 --> 01:43.875
You got all the time
in the world.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.708
[machine whirring]

02:05.333 --> 02:06.750
[beeping]

02:07.708 --> 02:10.583
Finally got another roll
of 80-micron, Bill.

02:10.583 --> 02:12.125
Okay, I'll get right...

02:12.875 --> 02:15.000
Bill? Typical.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.375
Eight hundred million on robots
and the phones don't work.

02:18.375 --> 02:19.458
[screaming]

02:32.208 --> 02:33.458
Target achieved.

02:43.625 --> 02:44.708
What's going on?

02:45.375 --> 02:46.708
We do not know.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.583
However, based upon
the urgency

02:48.583 --> 02:50.000
of Professor Xavier's summons,

02:50.458 --> 02:53.000
it would appear to be
a matter of some importance.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.458
You sure got a windy way
of saying,

02:55.458 --> 02:56.500
"Get the lead out."

02:57.833 --> 02:58.833
[all exclaiming]

02:59.333 --> 03:01.416
Not quite what
you were expecting, is it?

03:01.833 --> 03:04.750
That, Professor,
would be an understatement.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.958
I don't get it.
If it's for Gambit and Rogue,

03:06.958 --> 03:08.208
you're a week early.

03:08.208 --> 03:10.625
Besides,
isn't a catered ceremony

03:10.625 --> 03:12.291
a tad excessive?

03:12.291 --> 03:14.708
You'll get your answer
in about three seconds.

03:14.708 --> 03:17.583
[sniffing]
I... I don't believe it.

03:19.416 --> 03:20.833
Hiya, Wolverine.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.958
You should see your face.

03:22.958 --> 03:24.708
Looks something like this.

03:24.708 --> 03:25.875
[laughs]

03:25.875 --> 03:28.000
It's good to have you back, kid.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.250
To quote the poet Villaquez,

03:30.250 --> 03:31.708
"A return to the fold

03:31.708 --> 03:34.083
is truly one of life's
greatest joys."

03:34.500 --> 03:36.958
Scott, it's been a long time.

03:36.958 --> 03:40.333
-A toast to Morph's
homecoming.
-[Jean] Charles, wait.

03:40.708 --> 03:43.625
A news report on the mutant
activities monitoring circuit.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.625
I'm standing in front
of Zydex Industries,

03:45.625 --> 03:48.458
the target
of a terrorist attack
just hours ago.

03:48.458 --> 03:49.750
Details are sketchy,

03:49.750 --> 03:51.000
but sources suspect

03:51.000 --> 03:52.458
mutant involvement.

03:52.458 --> 03:53.875
The army is being sent in

03:53.875 --> 03:55.750
to seal off the area.

03:55.750 --> 03:56.875
[Morph]
The army?

03:56.875 --> 03:58.000
Indeed.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.750
It is rumored that Zydex

03:59.750 --> 04:01.375
has developed
a synthetic polymer

04:01.375 --> 04:03.750
with pervasive combat
arena applications.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.000
You wanna give us
that in English?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.875
They may have invented
a plastic as thin as cloth,

04:08.875 --> 04:11.625
yet 100 times
stronger than steel.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.625
Do you suspect someone,
Professor?

04:13.625 --> 04:17.083
If this is the next generation
of weapons material,

04:17.083 --> 04:19.333
and it were to fall
into the wrong hands,

04:19.333 --> 04:20.875
whether mutant or human,

04:21.333 --> 04:24.291
the consequences
would be dire indeed.

04:24.291 --> 04:25.833
We must learn more.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.375
Morph and I'll go.

04:27.375 --> 04:28.500
What do you say, kid?

04:28.958 --> 04:30.750
Ready to get back
in the saddle?

04:31.458 --> 04:33.291
[imitating John Wayne]
Reckon I am, pilgrim.

04:33.291 --> 04:34.708
Let's you and me head out

04:34.708 --> 04:37.208
and find us some
poll-ee-mere rustlers.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.416
Did he say wrestlers?

04:40.083 --> 04:42.250
Rustlers, my sweaty
rocket scientist.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.583
As in cattle thieves,
19th-century North American,

04:45.583 --> 04:48.625
here used as a loose metaphor
for the polymer peculators.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.166
You will take it easy?

04:51.166 --> 04:53.333
Sure, Doc.
[laughs]

04:53.333 --> 04:54.583
After we have some cake.

05:05.458 --> 05:06.500
[beeping]

05:18.333 --> 05:19.583
Let's do it.

05:22.875 --> 05:25.625
Relax, soldier.
I'm relieving you.
Report back to base.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.583
But, sir, I was told to...

05:27.583 --> 05:29.375
-That's an order.
-Yes, sir.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.833
[laughs]

05:32.875 --> 05:35.083
Still haven't lost
your touch, I see.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.416
Just like riding a bicycle.

05:37.958 --> 05:40.750
I should've ordered
that solider to unlock
this thing.

05:40.750 --> 05:41.875
No problem.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.166
Looks like you haven't
lost your touch either.

05:45.166 --> 05:46.166
[laughs]

05:46.166 --> 05:47.166
[helicopter whirring]

05:51.458 --> 05:53.875
Feels like old times,
huh, Wolverine?

05:53.875 --> 05:54.875
Yeah.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.458
Just for the record, Morph,

06:02.458 --> 06:04.125
I always knew in my gut

06:04.125 --> 06:05.250
you'd be coming back.

06:05.708 --> 06:08.000
You're not gonna get
all mushy on me, are you?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
I don't get mushy.

06:13.458 --> 06:14.958
We're in.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.000
Looks like my place
after a card game.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.166
Make it fast, Wolverine.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.333
The mini jet camera shows

06:19.333 --> 06:21.000
increased security activity.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.458
Keep your shirt on, pretty boy.

06:23.458 --> 06:24.750
I don't need you to...

06:25.250 --> 06:27.125
-[sniffs]
-[Cyclops]]Wolverine,
what is it?

06:28.125 --> 06:29.166
That smell.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.625
Oh, no. Sentinels.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.333
Easy, big guy,
it's just me.

06:37.166 --> 06:38.708
-Find anything?
-Nothing.

06:38.708 --> 06:39.708
Come on, let's beat it.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.000
It can't be.

06:58.458 --> 06:59.458
[screams]

07:03.583 --> 07:05.500
Morph. You knew.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.250
-Yeah.
-Don't baby me.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.208
Either I'm on the team
or I'm not!

07:12.083 --> 07:13.958
I thought this one
would be easy.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.500
How awful for Morph,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.083
to be once again confronted
by that

07:20.083 --> 07:22.250
which so nearly
destroyed him.

07:22.708 --> 07:23.958
It is rather Melvillean.

07:24.416 --> 07:26.083
Morph is not unlike Ahab,

07:26.083 --> 07:28.375
facing the great white whale.

07:28.375 --> 07:30.166
Let us hope he has better luck.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.625
The Sentinels are our
worst nightmare come to life.

07:33.625 --> 07:37.250
I prayed we had eliminated
the last of the Sentinels.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.875
They have but one purpose,

07:38.875 --> 07:42.583
to find, control
and destroy mutants.

07:42.583 --> 07:45.208
We cannot reason with them,
only fight.

07:45.708 --> 07:48.000
They are without conscience,
without fear.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.458
But the real question is,

07:50.250 --> 07:52.333
who has brought them back?

07:52.333 --> 07:55.083
[Mastermold]
our mission remains unfinished.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.333
Mutants still live.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.125
The time has come

07:59.125 --> 08:01.958
for Mastermold to be reborn.

08:02.416 --> 08:05.750
My new body shall be
superior in strength

08:05.750 --> 08:07.333
to my shattered one,

08:07.333 --> 08:10.083
with a skin that is
virtually indestructible.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.000
The same skin

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I shall use to create

08:14.000 --> 08:16.416
a new generation of Sentinels,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.875
to replace those
who were taken from me.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.000
But there are those
who must bear witness

08:23.000 --> 08:24.291
to my resurrection.

08:24.708 --> 08:27.458
Bring me Trask and Gyrich.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.500
[Sentinels]
We are not programmed
to apprehend

08:29.500 --> 08:31.416
non-mutant humans, Mastermold.

08:31.958 --> 08:34.875
You are now.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.583
And bring me the mutant

08:41.583 --> 08:43.625
who destroyed my body.

08:51.416 --> 08:53.125
He shall pay

08:53.125 --> 08:55.875
the greatest price of all.

08:55.875 --> 08:59.083
Don't blame Wolverine
for his concern for you, Morph.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.458
Near-death trauma is difficult

09:01.458 --> 09:03.208
for anyone to put behind him.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.125
You may not be over yours.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.625
-Moira warned me--
-I'm fine! I'm ready.

09:07.625 --> 09:10.333
We'll never know for sure
if all of you hold my hand

09:10.333 --> 09:12.250
every time things get tough.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.708
-I have to try.
-Agreed.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.375
But, please,
do not take it badly

09:17.375 --> 09:19.708
if I choose not to send you
against the Sentinels

09:19.708 --> 09:21.291
for your first assignment.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.875
Self-confidence
is a delicate thing.

09:24.416 --> 09:26.166
I want yours strong again.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.750
I don't believe it.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.416
-[Jean] What's happening?
-[Storm] Trouble.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.833
[beeping]

09:58.875 --> 10:00.125
Who pulled the plug?

10:00.125 --> 10:01.458
[Computer]
Mansion sensors

10:01.458 --> 10:03.458
detect intruders.

10:03.458 --> 10:04.875
Intruders?

10:04.875 --> 10:05.958
You're right about me

10:05.958 --> 10:07.375
facing the Sentinels, Professor.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.458
I just hate to admit it.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.416
-[Beast]]Professor.
-Yes, Beast.

10:11.416 --> 10:14.375
[Beast]
Defensive systems
indicate multiple intruders.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.708
I sense no extraneous
minds present.

10:17.750 --> 10:18.875
T-There!

10:18.875 --> 10:20.708
[Sentinels approaching]

10:36.625 --> 10:38.333
[Sentinel]
Target identified.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.166
[Beast]
Professor, please, answer!

10:47.708 --> 10:48.833
[beeping]

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
[groans]

10:56.333 --> 10:57.416
G-Get back!

10:59.416 --> 11:01.291
[Sentinel]
Capture initiated.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.875
No!

11:08.333 --> 11:09.416
Allow me.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.625
[beeping]

11:19.333 --> 11:22.250
[grunting]

11:22.250 --> 11:25.000
[Wolverine]
You ain't going nowhere!

11:25.875 --> 11:27.875
[screaming]

11:33.125 --> 11:34.125
[grunts]

11:34.958 --> 11:36.125
Are you all right?

11:36.125 --> 11:38.291
Who cares? They got Xavier.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.750
I... I froze, Logan.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.000
Oh, Morph.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.375
Where have they taken him?

11:53.375 --> 11:55.125
Somewhere to the Southwest.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.333
Cerebro has recently
lost contact.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.750
He must be unconscious,

12:01.583 --> 12:03.250
or shielded from me somehow.

12:03.708 --> 12:05.166
Moira was right.

12:05.166 --> 12:07.458
I should never have
come back so soon.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.166
I could have done something,
but I choked.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.458
No one's accusing
anyone of anything.

12:13.458 --> 12:16.083
You don't have to!
I know what happened.

12:16.083 --> 12:19.083
I had him. I'm useless.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.458
Both of you, shut up.

12:21.125 --> 12:23.125
I don't care who
did what an hour ago.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.250
Right now,
we have to find Xavier.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.416
Those tin cans
exist to wipe us off
the face of the planet.

12:28.416 --> 12:29.750
Any suggestions?

12:29.750 --> 12:32.250
[Beast]
"A shatter'd visage lies,

12:32.250 --> 12:34.583
whose frown and wrinkled lip

12:34.583 --> 12:36.750
and sneer of cold command

12:36.750 --> 12:39.875
tell that its sculptor well
those passions read."

12:39.875 --> 12:42.708
Ozymandias,
by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

12:42.708 --> 12:46.458
I'd settle for it
telling us who sent it
and where it came from?

12:46.458 --> 12:48.708
The surface memory circuits
are damaged.

12:48.708 --> 12:51.458
But perhaps I can access
the central mnemonic core.

12:52.208 --> 12:53.458
Delicate operation.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.875
Just enough power to stimulate
the electronic cortex,

12:57.333 --> 13:00.166
but not enough to cause a surge
in the damaged circuits.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.458
Hmm. Fascinating.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.166
Two sets of coordinates.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.958
The first is the location
of the mansion.

13:07.958 --> 13:09.416
What about the other set?

13:09.416 --> 13:11.000
Our old nemeses,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.750
Henry Peter Gyrich
and Dr. Bolivar Trask.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.875
If these coordinates
are correct,

13:16.875 --> 13:18.583
you shall be led right to them.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.208
There wouldn't be any Sentinels

13:20.208 --> 13:22.250
if it weren't
for those two dirt bags.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.250
And we're gonna catch them.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.208
All of us? No, Morph.

13:26.208 --> 13:29.291
I... We need you
to stay here.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.833
Somebody has to remain
in the War Room

13:30.833 --> 13:32.833
in case the Professor
tries to contact us.

13:32.833 --> 13:35.583
I guess I can't blame you
for not trusting me.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.833
Don't worry, pal.
You'll get your shot.

13:37.833 --> 13:38.833
[Cyclops]
Let's move it.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.833
I'm not useless.

14:00.708 --> 14:03.375
[Gyrich]
While you've been
wasting your time, Trask,

14:03.375 --> 14:04.625
look what I've caught.

14:05.416 --> 14:07.000
[Trask]
My notes!

14:07.000 --> 14:08.583
Now clean it
and cook it for lunch.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.125
I'm a scientist,
Gyrich, not a fry cook.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.958
Some scientist.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.583
Because you couldn't
control your creations,

14:15.583 --> 14:19.208
we've got to hide
in this stinking jungle
for the rest of our lives!

14:19.208 --> 14:21.291
You were the one
who wanted to kidnap Kelly.

14:21.291 --> 14:24.166
He's why we're here.
Mastermold was perfect!

14:24.166 --> 14:27.166
Yeah, so perfect
he turned on us,

14:27.166 --> 14:28.500
or have you forgotten?

14:28.958 --> 14:30.583
-[rumbling]
-[gasping]

14:34.333 --> 14:36.583
[screaming]

14:36.583 --> 14:39.250
[Trask]
I created you.
Put us down!

14:39.250 --> 14:40.458
That's an order!

14:40.458 --> 14:42.583
Disregard human orders.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.875
We obey only Mastermold.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.708
Mastermold?

14:51.083 --> 14:53.375
[roaring]

14:53.375 --> 14:54.750
[Wolverine]
Hand him over.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.416
Demon, be gone!

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
[grunting]

15:09.458 --> 15:10.458
Storm!

15:11.333 --> 15:12.583
They're both down.

15:13.083 --> 15:14.125
We're going in.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.333
Eliminate all resistance.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.208
Come on, Trask.
Let's get out of here!

15:31.750 --> 15:33.291
[Sentinel]
Target humans escaping.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.333
[screaming]

15:43.458 --> 15:45.416
[Wolverine]
Come on.
They're getting away.

15:46.708 --> 15:49.875
They are prisoners
of the Sentinels,
just as the Professor is.

15:49.875 --> 15:53.000
Well, if they didn't
send them, who did?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.291
[Beast]
I believe
we shall soon find out.

15:55.708 --> 15:57.458
[Morph]
Beast was easy on you.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.458
You'll tell me all your secrets,

15:59.458 --> 16:01.458
even I have to
blow them out of you.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.375
Another set of coordinates?

16:05.375 --> 16:07.625
They're looking
for the Professor
in the wrong place.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.458
[coughs]
I've got to tell Scott.

16:15.458 --> 16:18.000
No. I have to do this alone.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.958
[Xavier]
What do you want, Mastermold?

16:41.958 --> 16:43.708
Why have you brought us here?

16:43.708 --> 16:45.375
From the two traitors,

16:45.375 --> 16:48.416
I want nothing
but the use of their hands.

16:48.416 --> 16:50.166
But from you, Professor,

16:50.625 --> 16:53.375
I want something infinitely
more personal.

16:53.375 --> 16:54.875
I want your mind.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.125
You want what?

16:57.125 --> 16:59.958
A cybernetic link
with my electronic brain

16:59.958 --> 17:02.583
will increase the unique powers
of your mind

17:02.583 --> 17:04.333
a thousandfold,

17:04.333 --> 17:08.166
and place them at my command.

17:08.166 --> 17:11.708
What you humans
might call high irony,

17:12.458 --> 17:15.208
using the greatest
of all mutant minds

17:15.208 --> 17:18.375
to help eliminate mutantkind
from the planet.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.458
You're mad, Mastermold.

17:20.875 --> 17:24.583
A machine cannot
be mad, Professor.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.625
That is a human failing.

17:27.625 --> 17:30.458
Prepare him for the operation.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.291
Hands off, Mastermold.

17:36.291 --> 17:39.083
Yeah. His brain stays put, pal.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.708
Annihilate all mutant intruders.

17:49.875 --> 17:51.333
[Wolverine screaming in rage]

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
[grunts]

18:02.958 --> 18:06.708
Help me. Please. Someone!

18:15.875 --> 18:17.125
[screaming]

18:17.708 --> 18:19.416
Foolish mutant.

18:19.416 --> 18:21.958
We exist to destroy you.

18:21.958 --> 18:24.208
You will never stop my children.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.458
That's where you're wrong.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.000
[Wolverine]
Morph, get out of here.

18:29.708 --> 18:32.625
We do not fear you.

18:33.458 --> 18:34.708
Eliminate him.

18:52.416 --> 18:54.416
[screaming]

19:04.333 --> 19:05.583
[grunts]

19:16.166 --> 19:17.166
[screams]

19:27.083 --> 19:28.833
No!

19:36.625 --> 19:38.458
Everybody out. Now!

19:41.750 --> 19:42.833
[beeping]

19:58.375 --> 19:59.750
Nice shooting, Morph.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.583
Looks like you're back
after all.

20:01.583 --> 20:04.500
Yeah. Kind of seems
like old times.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.458
I appreciate you saying that,

20:06.458 --> 20:07.958
but I can't stay.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.000
What do you mean?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.458
Part of that cave
fall on your head?

20:11.458 --> 20:12.958
I came through today,

20:12.958 --> 20:15.166
but what about tomorrow
or next week?

20:15.583 --> 20:18.250
Moira was right.
I'm not ready yet.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.416
I was just too bull-headed
to admit it.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.291
Goodbye, Logan.

20:22.708 --> 20:24.291
Morph, wait.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.708
Let him go, Wolverine.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.250
Morph knows what's best.

20:35.458 --> 20:37.583
If he can, he'll come back.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.166
He'll always be an X-Man.
