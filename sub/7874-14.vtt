WEBVTT

00:34.542 --> 00:37.086
Francine, you look great.
Steve, handsome as hell.

00:37.253 --> 00:39.088
Hayley, can you get the door for us?

00:39.296 --> 00:42.217
- Dad, I'm going with you.
- Sure, you're part of the family...

00:42.384 --> 00:44.970
...when we're going to a banquet
honoring minorities.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.180
- Hosted by Denzel Washington.
- Thank you.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.224
But you won't...
I've forgotten my point.

00:49.391 --> 00:51.561
Can you believe we'll meet
Denzel Washington?

00:52.645 --> 00:55.314
He's like Harrison Ford
dipped in chocolate.

00:56.691 --> 00:59.068
Time to celebrate
our brothers from other mothers.

00:59.235 --> 01:01.404
You positive this is what
the invitation said?

01:01.571 --> 01:02.698
Yes, yes. Trust me.

01:10.247 --> 01:12.624
You made us look
like complete racists back there.

01:12.791 --> 01:14.419
Did you even read the invitation?

01:14.586 --> 01:18.089
Of course. I skimmed it for keywords,
which were "black" and "face."

01:18.548 --> 01:22.844
It says, " Black people changing
the face of America. " What a boob.

01:23.052 --> 01:24.095
What was that, Steve?

01:24.262 --> 01:27.600
I asked Hayley
if I could squeeze her boob.

01:27.766 --> 01:30.227
I love it when you kids get along.

01:33.439 --> 01:36.776
<i>Hurry up, Roger. Grey's Anatomy
starts in just three minutes.</i>

01:36.985 --> 01:38.320
Don't you think I know that?

01:38.486 --> 01:43.074
I'm trying to create a drink that matches
the show in both taste and sinfulness.

01:43.241 --> 01:46.119
I'm calling it the "Sandra Oh."

01:46.328 --> 01:48.497
I'd like to breathe her bath water.

01:49.290 --> 01:53.502
Now blend, my beautiful blender.
Blend.

01:54.712 --> 01:57.340
Oh, no. What's happening?

02:00.552 --> 02:03.055
Well, I guess TV night's canceled.

02:03.263 --> 02:05.974
<i>Can't you watch Grey's Anatomy
with a non-blended drink?</i>

02:06.141 --> 02:10.104
There's only one thing I do
with non-blended drinks and that's drive.

02:13.024 --> 02:14.984
Morning, everyone.

02:15.193 --> 02:17.987
Come on, you're not still mad
about last night are you?

02:18.154 --> 02:21.617
We met Morgan Freeman, didn't we?
You got to shake his hand, Steve.

02:21.825 --> 02:24.870
- I was prying it off my throat.
- Boy, was he riled up.

02:25.037 --> 02:27.665
<i>You know, he was the narrator
in March of the Penguins.</i>

02:27.831 --> 02:30.751
Powerful, powerful piece of cinema.
Never saw it.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.421
I need help, people.
My blender broke last night...

02:33.588 --> 02:36.758
<i>...and I need a new one before
the next episode of Grey's Anatomy.</i>

02:36.925 --> 02:39.344
Give me that.
I'll put in this sharpening stone.

02:39.511 --> 02:41.304
It worked for the garbage disposal...

02:41.471 --> 02:43.808
...which inexplicably broke
that same night.

02:44.016 --> 02:45.810
Stan, I wouldn't do that...

02:49.021 --> 02:52.483
The Boob strikes again.

02:53.526 --> 02:55.529
- What's so funny?
- Oh, nothing.

02:55.695 --> 02:58.698
No, he said, "The Boob strikes again"
and then you all laughed.

02:58.865 --> 03:01.243
Who's "The Boob"?
Is that what you call me?

03:01.451 --> 03:04.621
It's just a nickname, honey.
It doesn't mean anything.

03:04.788 --> 03:08.042
It's like "fatty" or "baby penis."

03:08.251 --> 03:09.877
How dare you.

03:10.086 --> 03:14.006
I have been making the decisions that
keep this family on track for 20 years.

03:14.173 --> 03:16.969
I deserve a little respect.

03:18.303 --> 03:20.931
- You're in the pantry.
- I'm looking for peaches!

03:22.766 --> 03:23.809
Okay, people...

03:23.976 --> 03:27.104
...the global thermonuclear-attack drill
is about to commence.

03:27.313 --> 03:29.899
In order to ensure
maximum verisimilitude...

03:30.066 --> 03:33.653
...the exercise must be treated
as 100-percent real.

03:33.820 --> 03:35.196
Understood?

03:35.613 --> 03:37.991
Good. Let's begin.

03:40.786 --> 03:42.454
Sorry I'm late, sir. Is this real?

03:42.621 --> 03:44.123
One hundred percent.

03:49.796 --> 03:53.341
Nuclear war? Stan, are you sure?

03:53.550 --> 03:55.969
The CIA initiated
atomic-defense protocol.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.054
- We have to go now.
- What about Roger?

03:58.221 --> 04:01.350
- Leave him. There's no time.
- Stan, he's right in the window.

04:03.144 --> 04:04.312
You're in our hearts.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.109
Well, they're off to somewhere
in a hurry.

04:10.276 --> 04:12.029
Any luck finding me a blender?

04:12.237 --> 04:13.280
This one's pretty.

04:13.447 --> 04:17.743
Pretty? Bonnie Hunt's pretty.
This one's Bonnie Bedelia gorgeous.

04:17.910 --> 04:20.120
<i>- Who's Bonnie Bedelia?
- Die Hard's wife.</i>

04:20.286 --> 04:21.872
Oh, it costs money.

04:22.039 --> 04:24.125
Hey, what does this mean,
"add to registry"?

04:24.292 --> 04:27.003
Oh, that's a bridal registry.
When couples get married...

04:27.170 --> 04:30.256
...they choose the gifts
they want to receive from their guests.

04:30.882 --> 04:33.343
All I have to do
is get married by next week...

04:33.509 --> 04:36.263
<i>...and I can get my blender
in time for Grey's Anatomy.</i>

04:36.430 --> 04:39.350
I just need to find
a really desperate girl.

04:39.558 --> 04:42.937
Then you should try JDate. It's the place
where Jewish singles meet.

04:43.103 --> 04:44.897
JDate, huh?

04:45.064 --> 04:47.317
Klaus, these girls
don't look that desperate.

04:47.484 --> 04:51.655
Click on "Over 35 and Never Married."

04:52.280 --> 04:54.032
Jackpot!

04:54.199 --> 04:55.617
Oh, God, look at that one.

04:55.784 --> 04:58.162
Oh, God,
that's the picture she chose?

04:58.329 --> 04:59.997
That's how she advertizes herself?

05:00.164 --> 05:02.041
God! Scroll down.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.251
Further, further.
I can still see her neck.

05:07.964 --> 05:10.926
Here we are,
safely away from all the devastation.

05:11.134 --> 05:12.928
My God, it's really over.

05:13.136 --> 05:16.223
Just think of all those dogs
waiting to be put down.

05:16.390 --> 05:18.893
- Gone, all gone.
- What are we gonna do?

05:19.060 --> 05:20.520
- What'll we eat?
- I can't swim.

05:20.687 --> 05:23.231
- Dad, I'm scared.
- I wanna say something too.

05:23.898 --> 05:26.109
Listen to my every word
if you want to live.

05:26.275 --> 05:29.070
- Hayley, dig a fire pit.
- Steve, you go find some berries.

05:29.237 --> 05:32.658
Francine, you dig another fire pit
since Hayley's will be piss-poor.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.119
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna gather wood.

05:35.285 --> 05:37.329
- Anyone wanna make fun of me now?
- No, sir.

05:37.496 --> 05:40.332
- Sounds like a good plan.
- I'm a part of this conversation.

05:46.423 --> 05:49.884
Oh, my God, my cell phone.
There must be other survivors.

05:50.051 --> 05:52.178
Maybe one of our astronauts
orbiting Earth.

05:52.346 --> 05:54.598
Hello? Am I speaking to an astronaut?

05:54.765 --> 05:58.602
- Yeah, this is John Glenn, butt munch.
- Roger, you're alive.

05:58.769 --> 06:00.855
First, your boss called
about you leaving...

06:01.021 --> 06:02.815
...during the drill. He was shouting.

06:02.982 --> 06:05.652
Second, interesting footnote,
I'm not your secretary.

06:05.819 --> 06:08.989
What do you mean, "drill"?
You telling me the world hasn't ended?

06:09.156 --> 06:10.532
No. And by the way...

06:10.699 --> 06:13.910
...thanks for saving me and the fish.
I see where we stand.

06:14.119 --> 06:15.329
Oh, no.

06:15.538 --> 06:17.707
Yeah, I can't wait
till the family finds out.

06:17.874 --> 06:20.293
If they think you're a boob now...

06:20.751 --> 06:23.671
Oh, gotta take this. Hello?

06:23.838 --> 06:26.967
Well, shalom.

06:28.969 --> 06:30.971
Look, Dad's back.

06:31.138 --> 06:34.725
Yes. Well, as it turns out...

06:34.892 --> 06:37.228
This is difficult for me
to put into words.

06:37.437 --> 06:39.355
What, just tell us
what we need to do.

06:39.564 --> 06:43.860
You saved us from nuclear annihilation.
We have complete faith in you.

06:46.654 --> 06:50.868
Then your faith is well-placed, because
we're the last ones left on Earth.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.544
- What was that?
- Mosquito.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.053
If my family finds out
the world didn't end...

07:08.220 --> 07:09.846
...I'll lose their respect again.

07:10.013 --> 07:13.517
But I can't keep them out here forever.
There's only one thing to do.

07:13.684 --> 07:18.397
Concentrate very hard
and try to switch souls with this beetle.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.983
Stan, what are you doing?

07:21.150 --> 07:22.694
Answer her. That's your wife.

07:22.861 --> 07:25.155
- Stan?
- I'm looking for my contact.

07:25.322 --> 07:26.657
You don't wear contacts.

07:26.865 --> 07:30.911
Then peaches.
Listen, I'm gonna go...

07:31.453 --> 07:33.248
Nope. Rustle up some food.

07:33.414 --> 07:34.874
Good, because we're starving.

07:35.083 --> 07:38.586
Not for long, because I'm going out
to kill us some breakfast.

07:38.795 --> 07:40.880
Trish, that Denver omelet was great.

07:41.047 --> 07:43.508
A perfect follow-up
to the chocolate-chip waffles.

07:43.676 --> 07:47.054
Nice recommendation. You. You.

07:47.805 --> 07:50.683
I'm so full, and now I have
to hunt something for my family.

07:50.849 --> 07:52.393
I just hit a possum!

07:52.559 --> 07:55.230
Trish, do you have a bag
or some kind of container?

07:57.273 --> 08:01.736
So I had to fire Theresa, hire a painter
and get a new hygienist, all in one week.

08:03.863 --> 08:07.326
But I do well, though. I make a living.
I'm comfortable. Waiter.

08:07.493 --> 08:10.579
- Never mind, we're okay.
- Oh, Jacob, I'm so impressed.

08:10.746 --> 08:12.498
You seem to have it all figured out.

08:12.665 --> 08:14.834
Well, I grew up around
some very strong women.

08:15.001 --> 08:19.756
Can I say, Jacob, your nose job,
the doctor did fantastic work.

08:19.923 --> 08:23.135
- You can hardly even notice it's there.
- You like it? Dr. Bernbaum.

08:23.301 --> 08:25.470
I went in with a deviated septum
and figured...

08:25.637 --> 08:27.848
- "While I'm here..."
- "While I'm here..."

08:28.933 --> 08:33.604
Boy, I have never told a guy about
my nose job on the first date before.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.816
- It's a good first date?
- What do you think about doing it a...?

08:36.982 --> 08:40.236
- Sherry, will you marry me?
- It's Sharri, and yes.

08:40.404 --> 08:44.158
Oh, Jacob,
you have made me so happy.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.953
Ma, you won't believe it.
He asked me to marry him.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.788
Yes, the orthodontist.

08:49.955 --> 08:54.169
Brandeis. Reformed. Ashkenazi.
Haven't seen the car.

08:54.335 --> 08:56.713
I know, isn't he great?

08:57.046 --> 08:59.090
We did it, Ma!

08:59.257 --> 09:02.011
We finally did it!

09:02.678 --> 09:06.223
Oh, no, my wedding ring.
I must have left it at home.

09:07.558 --> 09:10.186
- What is that, a rat?
- It's a possum.

09:10.394 --> 09:12.981
- We're supposed to eat that?
- Well, you are.

09:13.148 --> 09:16.818
Dig in. We'll use the pelt for napkins
and save the wishbone for game night.

09:16.985 --> 09:20.489
Oh, my God. Stan, it's a bear.

09:22.115 --> 09:25.411
Everyone, remain calm. Bears won't
attack if you're perfectly still.

09:25.578 --> 09:29.081
- Quick, let's get in the car.
- No, running is certain death.

09:30.416 --> 09:32.627
- Hold steady.
- Stan, the car is right there.

09:32.793 --> 09:34.295
It's unlocked.

09:34.462 --> 09:37.633
I've saved your lives once already,
haven't I? Hold your position.

09:39.343 --> 09:42.012
- We're gonna die!
- Hold.

09:48.394 --> 09:50.188
Hold.

09:53.691 --> 09:55.902
And that's how you kill a bear.

09:56.110 --> 09:58.364
That was a close one.

10:00.824 --> 10:02.284
You folks on vacation?

10:02.451 --> 10:03.494
Didn't you hear?

10:03.661 --> 10:06.747
All of civilization was destroyed
by a nuclear holocaust.

10:06.956 --> 10:08.750
I knew it was only a matter of time.

10:08.917 --> 10:11.670
That's the reason I moved up here
10 years ago.

10:11.836 --> 10:14.297
The name's Bu...

10:14.464 --> 10:16.383
Dang it. It's been so long, I forget.

10:19.804 --> 10:22.807
Buckle? Do people go by "Buckle"?

10:22.974 --> 10:27.937
- Some people go by "Buck."
- No, "Buckle" feels right.

10:28.104 --> 10:32.025
How would you folks like to come by
old Buckle's for a nice hot meal?

10:32.192 --> 10:34.278
- All right.
- Let's eat. You're a lifesaver.

10:35.028 --> 10:39.157
You don't need him. We've got food.
I just killed a bear with deadly stillness.

10:39.366 --> 10:40.993
You'll miss out on all the fun...

10:41.159 --> 10:44.163
...when the cubs come looking
for their mama and find her dead.

10:44.330 --> 10:45.999
God, I hope they're not too young.

10:46.165 --> 10:49.585
Childhood stolen from them,
forced to grow up before they're ready.

10:49.752 --> 10:53.047
Oh, wait, bear testicles.
Yep, those are bear testicles. Man bear.

10:53.215 --> 10:56.677
There's no room for you in our stories.
Hey, wait up.

11:00.305 --> 11:03.976
This place is amazing.
Did you do it all yourself?

11:04.184 --> 11:05.437
Carved everything you see.

11:05.603 --> 11:08.231
Hey, remember when I put up the shelf
in the garage?

11:08.398 --> 11:11.401
We used to have paint cans all over,
but then I put up a shelf.

11:11.609 --> 11:15.740
I was an lmagineer at Disney.
We'd build this crap in our sleep.

11:15.906 --> 11:16.949
Literally.

11:17.116 --> 11:20.453
They had this machine
that stole our dreams.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.705
- Really?
- Figuratively.

11:22.872 --> 11:25.082
Its name was Michael Eisner.

11:27.044 --> 11:28.086
Good one.

11:28.253 --> 11:31.423
Such a command
of the literal and figurative.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.633
Oh, my God, that looks so good.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.095
- Dad wanted us to eat possum.
- Nothing wrong with possum, son.

11:37.262 --> 11:40.600
Other than the fact that it's riddled
with parasites. Could kill you.

11:40.767 --> 11:44.228
I see what's going on here.
He's clearly jealous of my shelf.

11:44.395 --> 11:47.690
- Come on, everyone, let's go.
- Dad, I'm tired and hungry.

11:47.857 --> 11:49.693
Can't we just stay up here
with Buckle?

11:49.860 --> 11:52.571
Good idea.
Could be mutants down there.

11:52.738 --> 11:54.656
Mutants? What mutants?

11:54.865 --> 11:57.075
The people who survived
the nuclear blast.

11:57.242 --> 11:59.536
They absorbed enough radiation
to become...

11:59.703 --> 12:01.247
Oh, how do I put this?

12:01.414 --> 12:02.457
- Mutants.

12:02.624 --> 12:05.293
If they infect you,
you could become one of them.

12:06.419 --> 12:09.589
- Relax, there aren't any mutants.
- How do you know, Stan?

12:09.756 --> 12:13.928
Because there's only been one mutant.
He was half-human, half-divine.

12:14.094 --> 12:17.181
His name was Ricky and we kept him
in a secret government lab...

12:17.348 --> 12:18.974
...until he ascended to heaven...

12:19.141 --> 12:22.102
...after getting into the garbage
and eating some chocolate.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.736
Mommy, Daddy,
come meet my fiancé.

12:29.903 --> 12:32.155
Isn't he adorable.

12:32.322 --> 12:35.409
Russell Rothberg.
Can I get you something from the bar?

12:35.618 --> 12:37.078
Oh, I don't drink any more.

12:37.245 --> 12:39.163
Or any less.

12:39.330 --> 12:40.540
Double Scotch.

12:41.582 --> 12:43.459
Jacob, I have spent
the last 10 years...

12:43.626 --> 12:45.879
...preparing the perfect wedding
for my Sharri.

12:46.046 --> 12:49.383
I've already booked the Crystal Room
at the Hyatt for next June.

12:49.550 --> 12:51.593
At the risk of sounding
a little meshuga...

12:51.760 --> 12:55.055
...it's really important
that we get married by Sunday.

12:55.722 --> 12:57.725
Jacob, what's the rush?

12:57.934 --> 13:00.937
<i>It's my bubbie down in Boca.</i>

13:01.104 --> 13:02.730
The doctors gave her two weeks...

13:02.897 --> 13:05.149
...and her last wish
was to be at my wedding.

13:05.358 --> 13:08.028
- But Sunday is such short notice...
- Daddy, I want this.

13:08.195 --> 13:10.364
Then you'll get it, princess.

13:10.573 --> 13:12.908
We can have the wedding
in my back yard.

13:13.075 --> 13:15.703
Fantastic.
I'll handle all the arrangements.

13:16.912 --> 13:19.416
Mitzvahs all around.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.294
I'm gonna top this off.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.007
Finished. Buckle's got nothing on me.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.302
This will provide shelter
and hold things.

13:29.510 --> 13:34.432
- We don't have any things.
- A shelf we don't even need. Lavish.

13:34.890 --> 13:36.684
We should've just stayed with Buckle.

13:36.851 --> 13:39.562
Maybe he still has some food left.
I'm starving.

13:39.770 --> 13:41.148
No, no. I can do this.

13:41.315 --> 13:44.651
I promise I will find us something to eat
within the hour.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.653
But I can't promise anything.

13:53.286 --> 13:56.831
There's gotta be a mess hall
around here somewhere.

14:00.668 --> 14:02.713
Bingo.

14:16.728 --> 14:18.104
All right.

14:18.271 --> 14:21.316
Hey, I'm gonna just go in the kitchen
and steal your food.

14:21.483 --> 14:24.235
Marlee Matlin sucks.

14:24.611 --> 14:27.948
<i>You know, that's not fair. I really
enjoyed her work on The West Wing.</i>

14:30.159 --> 14:34.538
<i>Taking all the fruit
from the helpless deaf kids...</i>

14:36.124 --> 14:37.501
It's just one.

14:37.709 --> 14:40.504
Francine, start the car!

14:40.712 --> 14:41.755
What?

14:43.381 --> 14:46.384
Buckle was right. Mutants!

14:55.019 --> 14:56.229
No, don't shoot.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.064
You saved a mutant.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.735
They bit Dad
and now he's one of them. Run!

15:07.783 --> 15:09.326
Wait. I'm not a mutant.

15:09.493 --> 15:10.870
Stay away from us.

15:12.747 --> 15:16.209
You have to believe me,
there's no such thing as mutants.

15:19.379 --> 15:22.591
There's no such thing as mutants
because the world didn't end.

15:22.758 --> 15:24.510
You lied to us, Dad?

15:24.677 --> 15:26.720
Oh, I tell a great story and I'm a liar...

15:26.887 --> 15:30.099
...but Harry Potter does it
and he's your favorite writer.

15:34.771 --> 15:36.189
I can't believe you, Stan.

15:36.356 --> 15:39.150
How long were you planning
on keep us up here? Forever?

15:39.359 --> 15:41.069
What? No.

15:42.737 --> 15:47.577
Come on, kids, let's just go home.
You can ride in the back.

15:50.746 --> 15:52.790
Wait! Where are you folks going?

15:52.957 --> 15:54.293
The world didn't really end.

15:54.459 --> 15:56.253
So you're just leaving me here?

15:56.420 --> 15:59.715
Hayley, you and I were supposed to
repopulate the Earth together.

15:59.882 --> 16:03.802
- What are you talking about?
- You and me doing it all the time.

16:03.969 --> 16:05.346
You're creeping me out.

16:05.513 --> 16:08.016
And you're embarrassing me
in front of your family.

16:09.976 --> 16:11.936
Hayley, can you wrap this up?

16:12.145 --> 16:15.231
Look, just go away.
It's never gonna happen. Ever.

16:15.398 --> 16:17.610
But I must have you.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.320
Step on it, Mom.

16:20.154 --> 16:25.075
Don't be frightened by the way I look.
I'm gentle and kind.

16:27.662 --> 16:31.082
No, we were just playing.

16:37.881 --> 16:40.760
- This thing is giving me carpal tunnel.
- I'll hold it, dear.

16:40.926 --> 16:44.472
- No. You don't know what you're doing.
- There it is.

16:44.680 --> 16:48.601
Oh, my sweet.
Soon we will be together. Soon.

16:48.768 --> 16:52.564
- Jacob. Jacob, is it warm in here?
- It's warm, dear.

16:52.731 --> 16:54.900
Why don't you say something
to the manager.

16:55.067 --> 16:57.444
Right away, dear.

17:00.697 --> 17:04.993
That was a great vacation, huh, guys?
Best thing, totally spontaneous.

17:05.203 --> 17:08.122
- We're not talking to you, Stan.
- What are you mad at me for?

17:08.289 --> 17:11.041
I stopped Steve from shooting
a deaf kid. I'm a hero.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.669
Hero? Thanks to you...

17:12.836 --> 17:16.673
...I missed a week of school and
got addicted to hallucinogenic berries.

17:16.882 --> 17:20.551
That's right. They make me see colors
and I'm keeping them.

17:22.054 --> 17:25.392
I was nearly attacked by a sex-crazed
mountain man because of you.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.560
Message received.
I will build you your very own shelf.

17:28.770 --> 17:33.108
Why do we even bother?
The Boob strikes again.

17:35.945 --> 17:38.572
It's him. It's the mountain man.
He's found us.

17:39.407 --> 17:40.449
I don't see anything.

17:40.616 --> 17:43.119
Dad's trying to scare us again
so we'll respect him.

17:43.327 --> 17:46.414
- I swear it was him.
- Enough, Stan. No one's listening.

17:46.623 --> 17:49.584
How come? Is it a volume issue?!

17:51.294 --> 17:54.422
Come on, mountain man.
Come to papa.

17:57.593 --> 18:00.012
- Gotcha.
- Stan, who's that?

18:00.179 --> 18:02.849
- The mountain man. He's in disguise.
- That's not him.

18:03.015 --> 18:06.894
Oh, that's the caterer for my wedding.
P.S., everyone, there's a wedding.

18:07.103 --> 18:09.606
There's gonna be chafing dishes,
a carving station...

18:09.773 --> 18:11.316
...and lots and lots of Jews.

18:11.942 --> 18:13.861
I'm sorry, are you saying "juice"?

18:14.069 --> 18:15.779
No, "Jews." Lots of Jews.

18:15.946 --> 18:18.574
It's a Jewish affair.
I'll be impersonating a Jew.

18:21.286 --> 18:24.164
What are you doing here?
The mountain man could be anywhere.

18:24.372 --> 18:27.667
Stan, enough.
This day isn't about you and your lies.

18:27.834 --> 18:30.212
It's about Roger and his lies.

18:30.421 --> 18:32.715
- So, you nervous?
- A little bit.

18:32.882 --> 18:35.384
You got to admit,
it was a pretty crazy plan.

18:35.551 --> 18:39.388
Oh, wait, you're not in on it. It's here.

18:40.222 --> 18:44.519
- You excited, Jacob?
- Of course I'm excited. Twelve speeds.

18:44.686 --> 18:47.063
Nice meeting you, Mr. Rothberg.
I'm out of here.

18:47.230 --> 18:49.190
The wedding's about to start.

18:49.357 --> 18:51.818
Yeah, look, I lied.
I'm not an orthodontist.

18:51.985 --> 18:54.614
That's okay, you can work
for my greeting-card company.

18:54.780 --> 18:56.991
- I'm also not Jewish.
- You'll convert.

18:57.199 --> 18:59.035
- I'm not even human.
- Who is?

19:00.536 --> 19:02.830
You're strong.

19:08.003 --> 19:09.129
I'm freaking out, Stan.

19:09.296 --> 19:12.257
I'm not marriage material,
and she's so desperate.

19:12.424 --> 19:13.800
You have to help me.

19:15.637 --> 19:17.764
Oh, God, here she comes.

19:17.931 --> 19:21.392
Maybe I imagined the mountain man.
Maybe I am just a boob.

19:21.559 --> 19:23.853
Here, put your gun in your hand
and shoot her.

19:25.271 --> 19:28.192
I'm through messing around.
She's at the second row.

19:28.359 --> 19:30.361
You have the shot, take it.
Take her down!

19:30.527 --> 19:32.529
Hi, baby. Happiest day of my life.

19:33.781 --> 19:36.825
Oh, my God, it's him.
It's the mountain man.

19:37.035 --> 19:38.328
Dad was telling the truth.

19:38.536 --> 19:42.332
I've come for you, Hayley.
I got us a room at the Marriott.

19:42.499 --> 19:46.086
- Dad, help.
- Out of the way, I'm passing over.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.545
Get it? Me neither.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.347
Daddy, do something.
No one's looking at me.

19:57.598 --> 20:00.227
I am gonna cut you
like day-old challah.

20:00.435 --> 20:03.855
Stop. No more,
Jew jokes, I give up.

20:05.107 --> 20:06.775
I never meant your family any harm.

20:06.942 --> 20:11.406
It's just, I haven't seen a woman
in over a decade and I'm so desperate.

20:13.616 --> 20:15.952
Desperate...

20:21.625 --> 20:24.002
<i>Stan, you really saved my tokhes
back there.</i>

20:24.169 --> 20:27.881
- I'm sorry we doubted you.
- So you don't think I'm a boob?

20:28.048 --> 20:31.218
Oh, honey,
everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

20:32.719 --> 20:35.974
But it doesn't mean
we stop respecting you.

20:37.892 --> 20:41.146
So I guess what you're saying is,
I'm only human.

20:41.312 --> 20:44.567
That's right. Give me a hug.

20:44.775 --> 20:46.110
What do you think, man?

20:46.277 --> 20:49.155
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

20:49.321 --> 20:52.324
Yeah, seems like a long way to go
for such an easy conclusion.

20:52.491 --> 20:56.329
Course, you've also ingested enough
poisonous berries to kill a small elephant.

20:56.496 --> 20:59.374
What? No, no, no, it's okay.
I'm in a good place.

20:59.541 --> 21:03.253
- I'll be fine. I feel like I'm gonna be fine.
- Did you tell him he gonna die?

21:03.420 --> 21:04.629
- Yep.
- What? No.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.799
- No, no, no.
- That's nice.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.844
Yeah. Yeah, right there.
Take my pollen.

21:25.027 --> 21:26.695
When was the last time we went out?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.824
Well, there was the waterfall.

21:30.033 --> 21:33.203
I mean really went out.
I wanna see a show.

21:33.745 --> 21:36.956
Forget it. I'm tired of looking at you.
Go down to the lake.

21:37.123 --> 21:39.417
- Fine.
- Fine. Go down to the lake.

21:39.584 --> 21:42.880
God forbid you should spend
any time with me.

21:43.047 --> 21:44.340
Take a jacket!

21:45.216 --> 21:47.009
I love that man.

21:51.014 --> 21:53.099
