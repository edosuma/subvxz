WEBVTT

00:10.651 --> 00:12.419
[Heath] Enjoy your crickets, losers.

00:12.453 --> 00:14.020
The Omega Chis pranked us?

00:14.055 --> 00:15.789
The old crickets down the chimney gag.

00:15.823 --> 00:17.290
[Casey] I poured my heart out to you

00:17.325 --> 00:19.326
at the end of the world party and you didn't

00:19.360 --> 00:21.094
- come after me.
- But I'm here now.

00:22.430 --> 00:24.464
What you guys need is a common enemy.

00:24.498 --> 00:26.366
We get our houses to team up against him.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.868
Bond over our hatred for Huck together.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.704
Guys, we can't hold this forever!

00:30.738 --> 00:32.505
- They need our help up there!
- Run, Cap.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.907
No, no, no, no!

00:35.743 --> 00:37.744
- [Cappie] You planned this?
- Yes! We left you guys holding

00:37.778 --> 00:38.945
the cart and we called the police.

00:38.980 --> 00:40.880
I had to do it to get my house back.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.950
And your solution was to get
three of my brothers expelled.

00:43.985 --> 00:46.186
[Evan] I could really use
a friend right now.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.955
The judges scores are in.

00:48.990 --> 00:53.226
The winner of this year's
SongFest is Gamma Psi.

00:53.260 --> 00:54.961
- [gasping]
- [indistinct chatter]

00:54.996 --> 00:58.331
The judges gave us 95, 95, 99 and a zero.

00:58.366 --> 01:02.002
He also gave the Gamma Psis a 100.
We have our proof.

01:05.373 --> 01:06.906
Rebecca, did you remember
to blow out that candle?

01:06.941 --> 01:08.908
We the sisters of Zeta Beta Zeta

01:08.943 --> 01:12.012
promise never to tell anyone
what happened tonight.

01:17.885 --> 01:19.786
I'm telling you, the hole has to be deeper

01:19.820 --> 01:21.688
or it'll come up after the first rainfall.

01:21.722 --> 01:23.690
Please say you learned
that from a scary movie.

01:23.724 --> 01:25.091
OK.

01:26.594 --> 01:29.129
- Would you stop eating?!
- I can't.

01:29.163 --> 01:30.830
Guys!

01:30.865 --> 01:35.135
Once we're done here,
we can put this behind us forever.

01:42.309 --> 01:44.511
No, not there. There.

01:44.545 --> 01:48.715
Hey, Betsy! It's good to be back, right?

01:48.749 --> 01:52.352
Gotta love spring.
Fresh start, wipe the slate clean.

01:52.386 --> 01:54.821
Yeah, and with all the
stress of burning down

01:54.855 --> 01:57.190
the Gamma Psi house,
I couldn't eat over winter break

01:57.224 --> 01:58.525
so I look fantastic.

01:59.860 --> 02:03.430
We don't know it was us, so...

02:04.465 --> 02:05.765
Hi, Laura!

02:05.800 --> 02:07.967
[chuckles] Uh, is it brighter in here?

02:08.002 --> 02:10.470
The Gamma Psi house used to
block the sun this time of day.

02:10.503 --> 02:12.138
We should get used to the brightness.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.407
That's what it'll be like
when they interrogate us.

02:14.442 --> 02:16.743
Did you tell anyone what we did?

02:16.777 --> 02:21.581
I didn't tell anyone, a, because we don't
know we did anything and b, we have a pact.

02:21.615 --> 02:23.450
- The pact.
- [cell phone rings]

02:26.020 --> 02:30.123
i>- Cappie! Where are you? - I wanted to get
a jump on the semester.

02:30.157 --> 02:31.558
I'm buying my books.

02:31.592 --> 02:33.960
Really? You do know that comic
books don't count, right?

02:33.994 --> 02:36.930
[Cappie] Ha, ha. Are you mad at me?

02:36.964 --> 02:40.200
No, I just thought you'd
be here for a romantic

02:40.234 --> 02:42.669
"I haven't seen you in three weeks" kiss.

02:42.703 --> 02:44.771
[Cappie] And catch your cooties? No
thanks.

02:44.805 --> 02:47.474
You're so full of...

02:54.181 --> 02:55.281
[phone beeps]

02:57.651 --> 02:58.718
Hello, Clarice.

02:58.752 --> 03:00.153
- Oh, my gosh!
- [grunts]

03:00.187 --> 03:02.155
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

03:02.189 --> 03:03.756
- I'm so...
- These are for you.

03:03.791 --> 03:06.159
- Thank you.
- [grunts]

03:06.193 --> 03:08.261
- Um. Oh, my God. Oh.
- [grunts]

03:08.295 --> 03:09.996
- Welcome back, Case.
- Hi.

03:10.030 --> 03:11.631
Hi. [moans]

03:16.203 --> 03:18.471
- Dale, I'm home.
- [man] Hello?

03:19.907 --> 03:21.374
Excuse me...

03:23.511 --> 03:25.912
Uh... Who are you guys?

03:25.946 --> 03:28.615
Hey, look who's back!
I see you've met my interns.

03:28.649 --> 03:31.317
- That's Todd and Tim.
- Actually, I'm Tim.

03:31.352 --> 03:34.220
- Darn it, I keep doing that.
- You have interns?

03:34.255 --> 03:37.023
Yeah, they're freshmen who got
in touch with me after the break.

03:37.057 --> 03:39.626
Apparently, they were dazzled by my project

03:39.660 --> 03:41.628
and my performance at the
Battle Bot competition,

03:41.662 --> 03:43.129
and wanted to be part of Team Kettlewell.

03:43.164 --> 03:45.632
Word gets around, huh? - Well,
you know, what can I say?

03:45.666 --> 03:47.167
They think I'm gonna win
the Gary Wyatt grant.

03:47.201 --> 03:48.801
Forty G's is a big chunk of cheese.

03:48.836 --> 03:50.003
When do you think we'll hear?

03:50.037 --> 03:51.538
It could be today, could be next month.

03:51.572 --> 03:53.673
All the officials said was this semester.

03:53.707 --> 03:55.842
This meatloaf's moldy.
Want me to throw it out?

03:55.876 --> 03:58.778
Or, we could take it to the lab,
determine its genus.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.614
Go crazy, fellas.

04:01.649 --> 04:03.316
Well, I gotta get going to the KT house.

04:03.350 --> 04:06.819
Hey, Rusty, wait. Um, are we OK?

04:06.854 --> 04:09.289
I mean, no hard feelings, or anything?

04:09.323 --> 04:11.658
Yeah, we're fine.
It's just three of my KT brothers

04:11.692 --> 04:13.693
- got expelled last semester.
- Really?

04:13.727 --> 04:15.828
Cappie didn't mention that
in his Christmas newsletter.

04:15.863 --> 04:18.697
He did have a fantastic date-nut bar recipe.

04:18.732 --> 04:22.435
So I gotta go. My house needs me.

04:25.973 --> 04:29.409
So who wants to learn the
chemical compound of dust bunnies?

04:31.212 --> 04:32.879
All right, come on.

04:45.459 --> 04:49.262
- Home sweet home.
- Ooh, happy last semester!

04:50.564 --> 04:52.999
Wait, why am I peppier than you?

04:53.033 --> 04:55.368
Are you worried about the
fire like everyone else here?

04:55.402 --> 04:58.871
[grunts] No, I wasn't until
you just mentioned it.

04:58.906 --> 05:01.641
Sorry. What's wrong?

05:01.675 --> 05:04.877
- Well, Fisher and I broke up.
- Wait!? What? When?

05:04.912 --> 05:07.046
When we talked on Christmas,
everything was great.

05:07.081 --> 05:08.815
Well, it just didn't work out.

05:08.849 --> 05:11.584
- Ooh, flowers.
- Do you want to talk about it?

05:11.619 --> 05:14.887
Ooh, flowers. Who are they from?

05:14.922 --> 05:17.724
- Cappie.
- And our front yard.

05:17.758 --> 05:21.327
- [laughs] Same old Cappie.
- Or, not.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.264
Cappie and I talked constantly over break.

05:24.298 --> 05:26.366
He even called to wish
me a happy Boxing Day,

05:26.400 --> 05:28.034
whatever that is. Um...

05:28.068 --> 05:30.270
I really think it's going to work this time.

05:30.304 --> 05:32.205
Well, then I do too.

05:32.239 --> 05:34.440
It's an exciting way to
start out the new semester.

05:34.475 --> 05:38.077
You've got a boyfriend,
I'm single, we're arsonists.

05:38.112 --> 05:40.213
We really need to stop saying that.

05:40.247 --> 05:42.382
We don't know we're responsible.
Which is good,

05:42.416 --> 05:44.684
because if we were, we'd be totally screwed.

05:44.718 --> 05:46.386
- [Rebecca] Hi.
- Hey, hi.

05:46.420 --> 05:49.289
You girls seem nervous and guilty.

05:49.323 --> 05:52.058
We were just talking about the fire.

05:52.092 --> 05:55.295
- Oh, that?
- You're not nervous?

05:55.329 --> 05:56.596
You were the one that lit the candle.

05:56.630 --> 05:58.931
We don't know that's what caused the fire.

05:58.966 --> 06:00.266
[Rebecca] Why would I be nervous?

06:00.301 --> 06:01.701
When we were leaving the Gamma Psi house

06:01.735 --> 06:03.369
I noticed how tacky the wallpaper was,

06:03.404 --> 06:04.737
which made me think this house blows,

06:04.772 --> 06:07.573
which reminded me to tell
Ashleigh to blow out the candle.

06:07.608 --> 06:09.776
- Who wants to hit the bookstore?
- You did not!

06:09.810 --> 06:13.146
OK, let's not keep pointing
fingers at each other.

06:13.180 --> 06:15.748
Says the woman whose idea it was to
go over there in the first place.

06:15.783 --> 06:18.484
OK, you managed to remember that correctly.

06:18.519 --> 06:20.153
Fine, I will talk to Katherine

06:20.187 --> 06:21.888
and find out how the investigation's going.

06:21.922 --> 06:24.057
We'll find out that we're not to blame
and we can go on with our lives.

06:24.091 --> 06:26.526
So, for now, can we just
relax and stay calm?

06:33.033 --> 06:34.667
[Beaver] Maybe we should
have a wake for Wade,

06:34.702 --> 06:37.603
- help us get over the loss.
- What about Jeremy and Ferret?

06:37.638 --> 06:39.305
They're gone, too. And Heath.

06:39.340 --> 06:41.741
'Cause "wake for Wade" is faster to say.

06:41.775 --> 06:43.976
- And it's alliteradation.
- Close.

06:44.011 --> 06:46.145
We should do something
to memorialize the guys.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.283
Or we could slaughter Evan
Chambers and the Omega Chis.

06:50.317 --> 06:51.551
That would perk us up.

06:52.686 --> 06:54.187
In due time, Beav.

06:55.956 --> 06:58.825
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you
think you're doing, pledge?

06:58.859 --> 07:01.160
- I was going to sit down.
- Yeah, but Wade sat there.

07:01.195 --> 07:02.962
Oh, sorry.

07:02.996 --> 07:04.030
[groaning]

07:04.798 --> 07:06.432
Wade sat there, too.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.234
I think Wade probably sat
everywhere in the house.

07:08.268 --> 07:11.270
Then it looks like he's standing.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.806
We should choose a replacement
for Wade as pledge educator.

07:13.841 --> 07:19.145
You know, maybe we don't need
a pledge educator this year.

07:19.179 --> 07:20.947
Why don't we just initiate all of them,

07:20.981 --> 07:22.215
that way we don't have to worry about it.

07:22.249 --> 07:25.485
Jeremy loved initiation,
especially the secret knock.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.687
[knocks twice]

07:28.589 --> 07:30.590
[sniffs] Man!

07:30.624 --> 07:32.425
I could be pledge educator.

07:32.459 --> 07:34.527
No offense, Spitter, but you're no Wade.

07:34.561 --> 07:36.229
[Rusty] No, but I am me.

07:36.263 --> 07:38.731
I feel terrible I wasn't
there the night Wade

07:38.766 --> 07:39.932
and the guys got busted.

07:39.967 --> 07:41.167
Come on, gimme a chance.

07:42.836 --> 07:44.270
All right, fine.

07:45.973 --> 07:48.141
[grunts] By the power vested in me,

07:48.175 --> 07:50.710
I now pronounce you pledge educator.

07:58.852 --> 08:00.153
[Calvin] History of Pornography?

08:00.187 --> 08:02.321
Yeah, hey, come on. I need this to graduate.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.956
[man] It's the douchebags.

08:05.726 --> 08:07.760
[chuckles]

08:07.795 --> 08:09.929
I guess the Cold War
with the KT house is over

08:09.963 --> 08:11.063
'cause of that prank.

08:11.098 --> 08:13.166
Now it's just open hostility.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.867
Your boyfriend was involved too.

08:14.902 --> 08:16.636
That maybe so. But he wasn't president.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.939
[sighs] Listen, I didn't mean
for those guys to get expelled,

08:19.973 --> 08:22.608
but I had to do something to
get control of the house back.

08:22.643 --> 08:25.044
- You get that, right?
- Yeah, I do.

08:25.078 --> 08:27.213
It just wish that it hadn't
happened the way it did.

08:28.348 --> 08:31.551
But, I guess the silver lining is that Grant

08:31.585 --> 08:32.952
finally feels good enough with the brothers

08:32.986 --> 08:34.620
that he's ready to come out to the house.

08:35.823 --> 08:37.557
He decided to tell his
family over the holidays,

08:37.591 --> 08:39.125
so now we're gonna come out to the house

08:39.159 --> 08:42.094
and finally have a normal relationship.

08:42.129 --> 08:44.597
- Congratulations, man.
- Yeah.

08:44.631 --> 08:46.232
Yeah, so what should we do for that?

08:46.266 --> 08:49.235
You wanna have like a...
like a brunch? Or...?

08:49.269 --> 08:51.304
No, I think low key is better.

08:51.338 --> 08:52.772
Don't wanna make a big deal of it.

08:52.806 --> 08:54.740
Right. - But it's good to know
you're in my corner for sure.

08:54.775 --> 08:56.476
- Absolutely.
- Uh-oh.

08:56.510 --> 08:59.946
Forgot, Byzantine Architecture.
I'd rather have your class.

09:02.216 --> 09:04.484
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:11.024 --> 09:13.426
- Well. See you around.
- Yeah.

09:16.663 --> 09:19.532
OK, so we'll have the chapter meeting
in the ping-pong room of my dorm,

09:19.566 --> 09:20.700
but we have to be out by eight o'clock

09:20.734 --> 09:23.035
because it's reserved for a pizza pow-wow.

09:23.070 --> 09:24.303
- OK, bye.
- [phone beeps]

09:24.338 --> 09:25.738
Hi, Casey, how are you?

09:25.772 --> 09:27.373
Good. How's it going?

09:27.407 --> 09:29.542
Just fantastic. The university here

09:29.576 --> 09:32.845
put me in this dorm room without wi-fi,
skateboarding stickers on my bed

09:32.880 --> 09:35.348
and a roommate who rages all
night and sleeps all day.

09:35.382 --> 09:36.849
[chuckles softly]

09:36.884 --> 09:40.820
- [woman groans]
- Oh, Angie, it is 4:00pm.

09:40.854 --> 09:44.724
- [Angie] Shut up, Mom!
- [sighs]

09:45.926 --> 09:47.860
[Katherine] So I know
you're here about SongFest.

09:47.895 --> 09:50.029
And despite the fact that my clipboard

09:50.063 --> 09:53.833
and all worldly possessions are
nothing but a pile smoldering ash,

09:53.867 --> 09:55.868
I am still looking into the situation.

09:55.903 --> 09:58.905
Well, actually, I came here
to see how you were doing

09:58.939 --> 10:04.176
and to tell you how very,
very sorry I am about the fire.

10:04.211 --> 10:08.981
Oh, well, that is very
oughtful of you, Casey.

10:09.016 --> 10:10.650
Did they find out how it happened?

10:10.684 --> 10:12.919
Faulty wiring? Oily rags?

10:12.953 --> 10:15.388
No, they are still investigating.

10:15.422 --> 10:18.157
Still? Seriously?

10:19.159 --> 10:22.662
I mean, that's gotta be hard for you.

10:22.696 --> 10:25.097
Well, in the meantime, Pan-Hellenic and IFC

10:25.132 --> 10:29.735
are organizing a "Help Us Rebuild Our
Castle" Fairy Tale Fundraiser Ball

10:29.770 --> 10:31.070
at the Canyon Lake Lodge.

10:31.104 --> 10:32.939
So, I really hope we can count on ZBZ

10:32.973 --> 10:34.540
to be there and give us support.

10:34.575 --> 10:37.443
[voice cracks] Anything to help Gamma Psis.

10:39.846 --> 10:41.514
[indistinct shouting]

10:42.983 --> 10:45.251
All right. Hey guys.

10:45.285 --> 10:46.919
- [man] Rebound.
- [man 2] Shoot!

10:46.954 --> 10:49.589
[man 3] Shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot!

10:49.623 --> 10:51.290
[cheering]

10:56.563 --> 10:58.297
My kindergarten teacher used to do that.

10:58.332 --> 11:00.032
I'm your new pledge educator.

11:00.067 --> 11:05.104
So, if someone could tell me
where Wade left off, um, maybe...

11:05.973 --> 11:08.207
- Yeah, Marbles.
- [belches]

11:08.241 --> 11:09.709
[all chuckling]

11:11.612 --> 11:12.878
OK. Any other questions?

11:12.913 --> 11:14.714
- Ooh.
- Anthony Hopkins.

11:14.748 --> 11:17.984
Can you teach us how to make
a stink bomb for Omega Chi?

11:18.018 --> 11:23.289
Well, actually, my job is to
teach you about KT history

11:23.323 --> 11:27.760
and how to steer you
through your pledgeship.

11:27.794 --> 11:30.296
So, uh... [mumbles]

11:30.330 --> 11:32.131
[indistinct shouting]

11:33.634 --> 11:35.334
[Rusty] OK, hey, guys... guys.

11:35.369 --> 11:37.637
I'd appreciate it if I could just get...

11:37.671 --> 11:39.338
...a little ounce of attention.

11:41.475 --> 11:42.975
- [shushing]
- There you go.

11:43.010 --> 11:45.778
Hey, how 'bout we find out
what the chalice means

11:45.812 --> 11:48.280
on the Kappa Tau crest.

11:48.315 --> 11:50.650
Go ahead with your little lesson, Spitter.

11:50.684 --> 11:53.519
They'll listen now. Won't they?

11:53.553 --> 11:55.488
- Won't they?
- [all] Yes, sir.

11:59.726 --> 12:01.627
OK, so first order of business:

12:01.662 --> 12:04.930
We're all gonna go to the
Gamma Psi Fairy Tale Ball.

12:04.965 --> 12:08.467
So we can dress up and be reminded
of how we burned their house down?

12:08.502 --> 12:11.203
We don't know that.
They're still investigating.

12:11.238 --> 12:12.338
[doorbell rings]

12:12.372 --> 12:13.973
[Rebecca] Besides,
fairy tales are such crap.

12:14.007 --> 12:16.242
Sleeping Beauty was based
on a story about a girl

12:16.276 --> 12:18.744
who was violated in her sleep
and then ended up pregnant.

12:19.880 --> 12:20.946
There's nothing sweet about that.

12:20.981 --> 12:23.783
[Betsy] Um, Ashleigh?

12:26.153 --> 12:31.157
Hello, fireman, sir.
How can we help you here at ZBZ?

12:31.191 --> 12:33.125
[crunches] - [man] I'm
going to all the houses

12:33.160 --> 12:34.727
to drop off fire safety pamphlets,

12:34.761 --> 12:36.529
in light of what happened at Gamma Psi.

12:36.563 --> 12:39.131
Oh, so you guys are done
with the investigation?

12:39.166 --> 12:40.866
Yes, and we determined

12:40.901 --> 12:43.169
the fire was started
accidentally by a candle.

12:44.671 --> 12:47.873
Look, I'm sure there are lots
of candles in that house.

12:47.908 --> 12:50.876
Like in a bathroom. Or the kitchen.

12:50.911 --> 12:53.846
There were. But the one that started
the fire was in the common room.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.716
- Jasmine, I believe.
- Ah!

12:56.750 --> 12:58.984
[man] You ladies have to be careful
about these kinds of things.

12:59.019 --> 13:01.220
- [mouths] Thanks.
- Have a good night.

13:01.254 --> 13:02.755
[all] Good night.

13:08.395 --> 13:12.131
- We burnt down a use!
- But he called it an accident.

13:12.165 --> 13:14.200
- Ashleigh, you're off the hook!
- [murmuring]

13:14.234 --> 13:16.402
[scoffs] Casey, What do we do?

13:16.436 --> 13:19.371
Uh, no one knows we were there.

13:19.406 --> 13:23.743
And no one's broken the pact. So...

13:23.777 --> 13:26.112
We're going to have to go to that ball.

13:44.921 --> 13:46.254
[man] What's up, Cap?

13:47.690 --> 13:49.991
- Cappie, can I talk to you?
- You know, can we do it later?

13:50.026 --> 13:52.127
I'm meeting your sister for costume shopping

13:52.161 --> 13:54.429
and if I'm late she'll make me go to
this ball as the least attractive dwarf,

13:54.463 --> 13:56.298
which I happen to think is Sneezy, so...

13:56.332 --> 13:58.667
Why'd you tell Beaver to babysit me?

13:58.701 --> 14:01.803
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't get eaten alive.

14:01.837 --> 14:04.439
Our pledges are cuddly,
but they are also vicious.

14:04.473 --> 14:06.508
[laughs] OK, well, they won't listen to me

14:06.542 --> 14:07.909
if they don't think I'm in charge.

14:07.944 --> 14:10.212
And I can't be in charge
when you don't let me.

14:10.246 --> 14:13.048
- I need to do this my way.
- And what, exactly, is your way?

14:13.082 --> 14:14.549
I'm thinking about getting a whistle.

14:14.584 --> 14:15.817
Add some orange slices

14:15.851 --> 14:17.385
and you've got yourself a youth soccer team.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.754
- Come on.
- All right, fine.

14:19.789 --> 14:20.922
No more Beaver.

14:27.496 --> 14:29.264
- Hey!
- Hey.

14:29.298 --> 14:30.532
Welcome back.

14:33.236 --> 14:35.270
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.809
- You put the picture out.
- Yeah, it seemed appropriate.

14:40.843 --> 14:42.844
And there's another photo op coming up.

14:42.878 --> 14:45.347
There's this fairy tale ball for Gamma Psi

14:45.381 --> 14:48.817
and I was thinking we could go
as Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

14:48.851 --> 14:51.920
People always thought they were a gay
couple in fairy tale land anyway, right?

14:53.356 --> 14:56.591
Um... about that.

14:56.626 --> 14:59.894
Um, I didn't exactly come out
to my family when I was home.

15:01.797 --> 15:04.032
- But you said...
- I wanted to.

15:05.334 --> 15:08.103
But... there was always a visitor,

15:08.137 --> 15:10.505
and the game was on and...

15:12.074 --> 15:16.411
I don't know, it just wasn't the right time.

15:18.180 --> 15:19.714
Hmm?

15:19.749 --> 15:22.450
So I guess there's probably
never gonna be a right time

15:22.485 --> 15:24.319
to tell the guys either, huh?

15:24.353 --> 15:25.887
I'm just not ready yet.

15:27.156 --> 15:28.189
I'm sorry.

15:30.626 --> 15:33.161
Look, that doesn't need to change
anything between us though, right?

15:33.195 --> 15:35.463
[Calvin] It kind of changes everything.

15:35.498 --> 15:37.766
We've been together for three months.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.169
And what, we're just supposed
to wait another three months?

15:45.474 --> 15:49.978
I'm not gonna force you to do anything
you're not ready to do, but...

15:51.347 --> 15:55.016
I can't stay in a relationship
that has to be a secret.

15:55.051 --> 15:58.653
- What does that mean?
- It means that as much

15:58.688 --> 16:03.258
as it kills me... I think it's over.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.108
[Cappie] How about I go as the Big Bad Wolf

16:20.142 --> 16:21.776
and you can go as the grandma?

16:21.811 --> 16:25.146
Um, the whole reason sororities
throw parties is so girls

16:25.181 --> 16:27.148
can look hot and slutty, not old.

16:27.183 --> 16:29.818
All right. Well, how 'bout I go as the wolf

16:29.852 --> 16:31.886
who blows down the Three
Little Pigs' houses.

16:31.921 --> 16:36.558
Or, in honor of Gamma Psi, is there a
version where he burns the houses to the
ground?

16:36.592 --> 16:38.259
You know what? I don't think so.

16:38.294 --> 16:41.629
You know, are we sure we
wanna go to this thing?

16:41.664 --> 16:45.300
I mean, who wants to sit around and listen
to people talk about a fire all night?

16:45.334 --> 16:47.435
You're right. You know,
I'm just go with the girls

16:47.470 --> 16:49.204
and I'll meet up with you later.

16:49.238 --> 16:52.774
That's not what I meant.
I'll go. I'll totally go.

16:55.077 --> 16:57.879
- Is everything OK?
- Um...

16:57.913 --> 16:58.947
With us, I mean?

17:00.750 --> 17:02.917
- Totally. Yeah, it's all good.
- Good.

17:02.952 --> 17:05.587
Honestly, I feel bad for them.

17:05.621 --> 17:08.455
Could you imagine what it would
be like if your house burned down?

17:08.491 --> 17:11.059
You know what? I need some... some air so...

17:11.093 --> 17:15.563
- Oh, my God. Oh, God! Um...
- Actually, that's the devil.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.031
- Yeah.
- [man] My bad.

17:17.066 --> 17:19.367
You know what? I really like this one.

17:19.402 --> 17:22.170
Um... I'm gonna go pay.

17:26.474 --> 17:29.677
[rock music plays]

17:32.782 --> 17:34.949
You're studying and classes
haven't even started yet?

17:34.984 --> 17:38.420
I'm reading about ways
to inspire young minds

17:38.454 --> 17:41.656
in hopes of becoming the
new KT pledge educator,

17:41.690 --> 17:43.792
since your house got our last one expelled.

17:43.826 --> 17:45.660
Oh, hey, I had nothing to do with that.

17:45.694 --> 17:48.596
I know. But that Grant did.

17:48.631 --> 17:50.899
I don't get why you're with that guy.

17:50.933 --> 17:53.268
Yeah, well, it's actually why I'm here.

17:53.302 --> 17:55.437
I was wondering if I could, you know,

17:55.471 --> 17:57.739
crash here until another
room in the house opens up.

17:58.908 --> 17:59.908
You guys broke up?

17:59.942 --> 18:03.278
Uh, well, let's just say we're driving on

18:03.312 --> 18:04.779
different sides of the same street.

18:06.449 --> 18:08.650
- So, can I stay here?
- Yeah, of course.

18:08.684 --> 18:10.485
You know, maybe it's for the best.

18:10.519 --> 18:13.087
- I never liked that Grant.
- Yeah, Rus.

18:13.122 --> 18:15.657
Thanks for having my back and all,
but... too soon.

18:15.691 --> 18:19.461
Hey, I think there's this gay guy

18:19.495 --> 18:20.829
in my Engineering program.

18:20.863 --> 18:23.331
- You want me to get his number?
- Absolutely not.

18:27.002 --> 18:28.903
[indistinct chattering]

18:33.809 --> 18:36.010
- [woman shushing] It's Evan.
- [chattering stops]

18:36.045 --> 18:40.782
- [Evan] Hi.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

18:40.816 --> 18:42.951
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

18:42.985 --> 18:45.119
- It was a little weird.
- It was a lot weird.

18:45.154 --> 18:48.623
[both chuckle] - So,
what I really wanted to say then

18:48.657 --> 18:50.925
was thank you for being there for me.

18:52.127 --> 18:53.828
You know, that night.

18:56.765 --> 19:00.368
You needed a friend, and I needed
what you brought to the table.

19:00.402 --> 19:02.604
[chuckles] True.

19:02.638 --> 19:04.806
Um, but, you know, I just
wanted to make sure we're cool.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.708
'Cause unlike the first time we hooked up,

19:06.742 --> 19:08.309
we're friends now so...

19:08.344 --> 19:10.378
I would say having sex
makes you better friends.

19:10.412 --> 19:12.680
- Hm.
- So yes, we're cool.

19:12.715 --> 19:14.249
- Excuse me.
- [Rebecca clears throat]

19:14.283 --> 19:16.451
Careful, there's a lot of pixie
dust and taffeta around here.

19:16.485 --> 19:18.786
Um, are you gonna go to the ball?

19:18.821 --> 19:21.489
I guess. But it's all a
bunch of nonsense. - Hmm.

19:21.524 --> 19:23.791
Did you know the real reason
Rapunzel got stuck in a tower

19:23.826 --> 19:25.627
is because her father tried
to sell her for food?

19:25.661 --> 19:29.531
That sucks. - Finally.
Someone who sees it the way I do.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.804
So let's just take it all in.

19:37.773 --> 19:38.973
Good.

19:39.008 --> 19:41.175
Tell me what your first impressions

19:41.210 --> 19:43.311
of Wade's room are.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.615
- Anthony Hopkins?
- It smells like dirty sheets.

19:47.650 --> 19:48.983
[all] Mm-hmm.

19:49.018 --> 19:51.686
- And bong water.
- That's good.

19:52.922 --> 19:56.057
I'd like to praise you for
your positive attributes

19:56.091 --> 19:58.159
and thank you for your contributions.

19:58.193 --> 19:59.727
Hey, what are you guys doing in here?

19:59.762 --> 20:01.229
Why aren't you meeting in the basement?

20:01.263 --> 20:04.766
We're bonding as a unit
by brainstorming on a way

20:04.800 --> 20:06.868
to honor Wade and the other guys.

20:06.902 --> 20:10.104
So we came up to Wade's
room to soak up his essence.

20:10.139 --> 20:11.573
Maybe I can help.

20:11.607 --> 20:14.342
I think I've got it,
but thank you for your offer.

20:14.376 --> 20:18.179
What I would focus on is
how much fun you guys had

20:18.213 --> 20:20.582
- when you were with Wade.
- I think we're having

20:20.616 --> 20:22.183
a pretty good time right now, so...

20:22.217 --> 20:24.586
Did you know that once when
I was having a bad day,

20:24.620 --> 20:28.957
Wade shaved his eyebrows
just to make me smile?

20:28.991 --> 20:30.792
I mean, you won't find
someone like that every day.

20:30.826 --> 20:34.228
True, but all sorts of things
can make this guy smile, so...

20:34.263 --> 20:35.964
[shushing] What else, Cap?

20:39.868 --> 20:40.969
No!

20:42.771 --> 20:46.240
OK, shows over. I'll just clean it up.

20:46.275 --> 20:47.709
It's just a bunch of beer bottles.

20:47.743 --> 20:51.079
From a trip Wade made around the world.
The world of beer.

20:51.113 --> 20:53.314
So we're going to keep them here forever?

20:53.349 --> 20:55.149
You know what? Everybody out.

20:55.184 --> 20:57.251
From now on, keep your
meetings in the basement.

20:57.286 --> 20:59.287
- Wade's room is off limits.
- Cap?

20:59.321 --> 21:00.922
Let's go, Spitter.

21:00.956 --> 21:03.057
[indistinct chattering]

21:07.396 --> 21:11.165
- Today totally sucked.
- Yeah, I almost destroyed a costume shop.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.568
I told Cappie it's because
I had too much coffee,

21:13.602 --> 21:15.937
but I don't know how long I
can keep this secret from him.

21:17.272 --> 21:18.806
I want to tell him about the fire.

21:18.841 --> 21:20.908
- You can't.
- But keeping this secret

21:20.943 --> 21:22.577
is creating all this weirdness between us.

21:22.611 --> 21:25.780
Casey, you started this pact.
You can't start telling people.

21:25.814 --> 21:28.116
Especially Cappie.
He's the kind of guy you go to

21:28.150 --> 21:30.518
if you want to start a fire.

21:30.552 --> 21:34.122
I don't think that you can trust
him with something this major.

21:34.156 --> 21:36.224
- That's a little unfair.
- OK, fine. Never mind.

21:36.258 --> 21:39.293
First the flowers, now this.
Suddenly you're down on Cappie?

21:39.328 --> 21:41.829
[sighs] I know you're in
this blush of rekindled love,

21:41.864 --> 21:43.197
but you can't count on him.

21:43.232 --> 21:45.299
What happens when you guys break up again?

21:45.334 --> 21:48.569
When? I told you,
it's not like freshman year.

21:50.673 --> 21:52.540
Why are you being so cynical, Ash?

21:52.574 --> 21:54.208
I'm being realistic.

21:54.243 --> 21:57.445
I know in your mind,
it's going to last forever.

21:57.479 --> 22:00.314
But I've been watching this dance
between you and Cappie for years.

22:00.349 --> 22:02.116
Will they? Won't they?

22:02.151 --> 22:05.053
I just don't think you should
share this with someone

22:05.087 --> 22:07.155
you're probably not even
going to end up with.

22:10.759 --> 22:11.893
[sighs]

22:24.174 --> 22:25.340
Um?

22:25.375 --> 22:28.410
Hey, invite the lady in.
Don't just stare at her.

22:30.980 --> 22:32.314
Hey... [chuckles]

22:32.348 --> 22:35.684
My apologies, Casey.
My interns are scientifically adept

22:35.718 --> 22:38.487
- but socially inept.
- Of course you have interns.

22:39.088 --> 22:40.222
Case, what's up?

22:40.256 --> 22:43.225
I need advice about something.

22:43.259 --> 22:45.661
Is it how to deal with Cappie
and his attitude lately?

22:45.695 --> 22:48.197
He's probably being weird
with you because of me.

22:48.231 --> 22:50.833
So, remember when you were eight

22:50.867 --> 22:53.235
and you took apart the TV
because you wanted to see

22:53.269 --> 22:55.404
what it looked like on the inside
but when you put it back together,

22:55.438 --> 22:57.639
- we stopped getting channel five?
- And you covered for me,

22:57.674 --> 22:59.074
you said channel five went out of business.

22:59.108 --> 23:00.542
Mom totally bought it.

23:00.577 --> 23:02.578
Then why did you wake her up
in the middle of the night

23:02.612 --> 23:04.246
- and tell her the truth?
- I don't know. I guess

23:04.280 --> 23:06.014
I didn't wanna keep something
like that from her.

23:06.049 --> 23:07.883
But what she didn't know
wouldn't have hurt her.

23:07.917 --> 23:09.852
But it would've messed up our relationship.

23:09.886 --> 23:11.653
We performed magic together.

23:11.688 --> 23:13.255
It would have been totally awkward.

23:13.289 --> 23:15.691
You mean more awkward than you calling Mom

23:15.725 --> 23:16.859
your lovely assistant?

23:16.893 --> 23:19.561
Hey, maybe you can help me with something.

23:19.596 --> 23:21.930
I can't seem to get my pledges in line.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.732
The sorority world is totally different.

23:23.766 --> 23:25.767
We just give them presents.

23:25.802 --> 23:29.204
I can't see puffy paint
making an impact on Dumptruck.

23:29.239 --> 23:32.507
Cookies are up. Take a few to go, Case.

23:37.513 --> 23:40.148
- They're so well-trained.
- I know.

23:40.183 --> 23:41.717
How did you make them to do that?

23:41.751 --> 23:45.153
Confidence. I know I'm the best,
therefore, they know I'm the best.

23:55.331 --> 23:57.432
- Where've you been?
- [Calvin sighs]

23:57.467 --> 24:00.135
I've been thinking about staying at Rusty's.

24:00.169 --> 24:02.804
Just until another room
in the house opens up.

24:02.839 --> 24:04.439
[Grant] You don't need to move out.

24:04.474 --> 24:06.008
We can divide the room in two

24:06.042 --> 24:07.709
and put a piece of tape down the middle.

24:07.744 --> 24:09.411
And since your bed's by the door,

24:09.445 --> 24:11.446
I'll come in and out the window.

24:12.715 --> 24:14.850
Probably not a good idea.

24:21.124 --> 24:24.159
I made you a copy just to
remind you how much I care.

24:24.193 --> 24:25.594
Grant, I know you do.

24:25.628 --> 24:28.030
I just wish you cared more about me

24:28.064 --> 24:29.932
than about what everyone else thinks.

24:29.966 --> 24:31.900
It's not that simple.

24:31.935 --> 24:35.537
Maybe I'm not ready for my life to change.

24:35.571 --> 24:37.806
I can't just close the door
on who I've always been.

24:40.176 --> 24:42.277
And I wish you could see
it as opening a door

24:42.312 --> 24:43.545
to something more real.

24:55.391 --> 24:57.459
Listen up, you numb-nutses!

24:57.493 --> 24:59.361
Uh... Who the hell is this guy?

24:59.395 --> 25:01.997
I'm your worst nightmare. Eyes forward!

25:03.933 --> 25:04.900
Who said you can eat?!

25:04.934 --> 25:06.301
[gulps]

25:06.336 --> 25:10.839
Now, it's my understanding that
y'all been taking advantage

25:10.873 --> 25:13.742
of Mr. Cartwright. So let me
make something very clear to you,

25:13.776 --> 25:17.279
if you think I'm scary, you have no idea

25:17.313 --> 25:21.016
what this man is capable of.
So it would behoove you

25:21.050 --> 25:24.753
to start doing what he says.
Do I make myself clear?

25:24.787 --> 25:27.556
- Do I?!
- [all] Yes, sir!

25:30.326 --> 25:31.393
Now we're ready to work.

25:32.895 --> 25:35.931
Whoa, whoa! Nobody said anything
about any pagan sacrifices.

25:35.965 --> 25:37.899
[whispers] It's Wade's.
I just brought it for back-up

25:37.934 --> 25:39.434
in case your way didn't work.

25:39.469 --> 25:41.370
But now it's just used for effect.

25:41.404 --> 25:42.404
Now, we're really gonna get some work...

25:42.438 --> 25:44.906
- [grunts]
- [all gasp]

25:44.941 --> 25:47.776
- My toe! - That's effective, all right.

25:47.810 --> 25:49.711
[whimpering]

25:51.814 --> 25:55.017
Nice twinkle lights. Although,
this did take you longer than I expected

25:55.051 --> 25:56.218
and someone needs the staple gun.

25:56.252 --> 25:58.920
My boyfriend was supposed
to help me. He's late.

25:58.955 --> 26:00.822
By forty-five minutes.

26:00.857 --> 26:03.058
Should never rely on a man for
anything other than procreation.

26:03.092 --> 26:04.359
My mother told me that.

26:04.394 --> 26:06.228
I hope this raises a lot
of money for your house.

26:06.262 --> 26:09.264
[Katherine] Yeah, I'm just having
a hard time feeling festive

26:09.298 --> 26:12.601
because we found out that someone was
in Gamma Psi before the fire started.

26:12.635 --> 26:14.436
Uh, how do you know?

26:14.470 --> 26:16.805
Well, we lit a ritual
candle before SongFest,

26:16.839 --> 26:19.041
and the last Gamma Psi out of
the house blew out the candle.

26:19.075 --> 26:22.244
I mean, maybe she's just saying
that she did because she feels bad.

26:22.278 --> 26:25.147
Burning down a house could
make you feel pretty guilty.

26:25.181 --> 26:27.816
I imagine. - I know she
did because it was me.

26:27.850 --> 26:29.651
I was the last person to leave the house.

26:31.287 --> 26:35.490
- I know that candle was out.
- Hey! Sorry I'm late.

26:35.525 --> 26:37.592
Uh, I'm Casey's boyfriend, Cappie.

26:37.627 --> 26:39.995
President of Kappa Tau. Right.

26:40.029 --> 26:43.398
Casey, remember my mother's advice.

26:48.104 --> 26:50.739
- My, she's tall.
- I gotta go, Cap.

26:50.773 --> 26:52.040
I thought we were hanging lights.

26:52.075 --> 26:54.009
Yeah, 45 minutes ago. It's already done.

26:54.043 --> 26:55.677
I'm sorry, there was
this thing at the house.

26:55.711 --> 26:57.913
Apparently, your brother
cannot handle cutlery.

26:57.947 --> 26:59.748
- But you could've called.
- Look, I'm sorry.

26:59.782 --> 27:01.917
It's just been kinda rough
at the house lately.

27:01.951 --> 27:04.286
Rusty said you haven't been yourself.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.456
- What's going on?
- Just stuff, you know.

27:07.490 --> 27:10.125
Stuff? Why can't you just tell me
when something's bothering you?

27:10.159 --> 27:12.394
Why, because you tell me when
something's bothering you?

27:12.428 --> 27:14.896
Things have been awkward between us
ever since you came back from break.

27:14.931 --> 27:17.599
I've been busy. You don't have to
come tonight, if you don't want to.

27:17.633 --> 27:19.267
I will go if you want me to go.

27:19.302 --> 27:20.936
Come if you want. Or not.

27:20.970 --> 27:23.405
I'm sorry, I just...
I have to get back to the house.

27:37.092 --> 27:41.061
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who's the hottest of them all?

27:45.796 --> 27:47.330
Still me.

27:47.364 --> 27:50.533
Hey, Evil Queen, you're standing on my hair.

27:52.135 --> 27:54.537
OK, um, we've got a problem.

27:54.571 --> 27:56.639
The Gamma Psis know
someone was in the house.

27:56.673 --> 27:59.075
They had a candle lit in the
common room before they left,

27:59.109 --> 28:01.177
- but Katherine blew it out.
- What do we do?

28:01.211 --> 28:04.046
I can't go to jail. I am not
going to be someone's bitch.

28:04.081 --> 28:06.816
Relax, Rapunzel.

28:06.850 --> 28:10.219
If I learned anything from shredding
documents for my dad when I was a kid,

28:10.254 --> 28:13.756
it's that if they can't link you to
the crime, you won't do the time.

28:13.790 --> 28:16.559
Rebecca's right. They can't
trace this back to the house

28:16.593 --> 28:18.594
because they don't have any
evidence that we were there.

28:18.629 --> 28:21.030
Yeah, sounds good, Case. Um, one question.

28:21.064 --> 28:23.733
Is it bad that I still
have Katherine's clipboard?

28:23.767 --> 28:25.401
You what? Why didn't you get rid of it?!

28:25.435 --> 28:27.770
Because it's proof we got
cheated out of SongFest.

28:27.804 --> 28:29.405
Yeah, it's also proof we were there

28:29.439 --> 28:30.906
the night the house burned down.

28:30.941 --> 28:32.708
I call top bunk in our cell.

28:32.743 --> 28:35.611
Ashleigh. Fire trumps voter fraud.

28:35.646 --> 28:37.246
I'll just keep it in my dresser.

28:37.281 --> 28:40.182
So when they show up with a
search warrant they'll find it,

28:40.217 --> 28:42.918
and we can all go to jail? Don't you watch
Criminal Minds.

28:42.953 --> 28:45.288
I'll put it in the dumpster outside.

28:45.322 --> 28:48.591
Trash is one of the first places cops look.
Hello? Law & Order.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.760
Then I will keep it in the trunk of my car.

28:50.794 --> 28:55.231
What if you get in an accident? They can
get our DNA from a single drop of sweat.

28:55.265 --> 28:58.100
- [all] Scrubs.
- [Casey] OK, girls!

28:58.135 --> 29:01.003
On our way to the ball, we'll put  someplace

29:01.038 --> 29:03.806
no one will ever find it and
then we will be done with it.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.374
For good.

29:05.409 --> 29:07.209
All right, look sharp, Dumptruck.

29:07.244 --> 29:09.011
You've got big shoes to fill.

29:09.046 --> 29:13.115
Wade and I were the Maverick
and Goose of the Allied Forces.

29:13.150 --> 29:15.184
- [man] Right.
- [Cappie] I'm going right.

29:15.218 --> 29:17.386
Why aren't you guys dressed for the ball?

29:17.421 --> 29:20.890
What good's a Pied Piper without his rats?

29:20.924 --> 29:22.391
Cappie, do you want to come with us?

29:22.426 --> 29:25.227
Uh, I'm not sure your sister wants me there.

29:25.262 --> 29:27.029
Yeah, she mentioned things were weird.

29:29.232 --> 29:31.701
She did? - You know what?
It's none of my business.

29:31.735 --> 29:33.936
Hey, come on, guys. Let's go.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.471
Come on!

29:35.505 --> 29:38.374
Yeah, before The Impaler cuts
off another one of our toes.

29:38.408 --> 29:40.509
You guys don't have to worry about that.

29:40.544 --> 29:42.411
I hid the cleaver, all right.

29:42.446 --> 29:44.380
We can't afford to lose any more appendages.

29:44.414 --> 29:47.383
Too bad we can't bail
on dressing up as rats.

29:47.417 --> 29:49.518
Look, if you guys don't want to go,
you don't have to go.

29:49.553 --> 29:52.054
- Sweet!
- Yes, you do.

29:52.089 --> 29:53.422
Yes, they're my pledges.

29:53.457 --> 29:54.890
Look, Spitter...

29:59.229 --> 30:00.629
You've given your all to these guys,

30:00.664 --> 30:02.732
but you just don't have them
under control the way Wade did.

30:02.766 --> 30:04.633
Maybe I would if you'd support me a little.

30:04.668 --> 30:06.969
- I've supported you.
- Oh, really?

30:07.003 --> 30:10.473
Sending Beaver to babysit me?
Interrupting my meetings?

30:10.507 --> 30:13.142
You're hiding Wade's cleaver?
You're undermining me.

30:13.176 --> 30:16.178
You just can't take Wade's
cleaver and expect to be as good

30:16.213 --> 30:17.613
a pledge educator as he was.

30:17.647 --> 30:21.283
I'm not trying to be Wade!
I'm trying to be me.

30:21.318 --> 30:23.486
I took this job because I love Kappa Tau

30:23.520 --> 30:26.188
and I wanted the pledges
to feel the same way.

30:29.359 --> 30:33.295
You know what? Maybe I'm not the
right guy to be pledge educator,

30:33.330 --> 30:36.265
but they deserve more than
what you're giving them.

30:36.299 --> 30:39.635
Wade's gone. Playing video games,
blowing off Greek events

30:39.669 --> 30:41.137
isn't the way to bring him back.

30:44.107 --> 30:45.541
[sighs]

30:49.513 --> 30:50.846
[door closes]

31:00.757 --> 31:03.559
- Would you stop eating?
- I can't.

31:03.593 --> 31:06.262
Guys... [sighs]

31:06.296 --> 31:08.998
Once this is done, we'll put this behind us.

31:09.032 --> 31:10.699
Forever.

31:12.502 --> 31:13.602
[clears throat]

31:16.940 --> 31:18.707
Nature creeps me out. Let's get out of here.

31:19.776 --> 31:20.876
[whispers] OK.

31:25.048 --> 31:26.348
[Ashleigh] Um...

31:28.051 --> 31:31.387
- We came in this way.
- No, we came in this way.

31:31.421 --> 31:36.892
I remember... stepping over a log...
at some point.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.767
[* Jupiter One: Fire Away]

31:44.801 --> 31:47.269
* Is anybody here OK? *

31:48.972 --> 31:50.739
[Calvin] Hmm?

31:50.774 --> 31:53.409
That is the weakest Big
Bad Wolf I have ever seen.

31:53.443 --> 31:54.610
And you're wearing a cape.

31:56.179 --> 31:59.582
Oh, by the way, I think I can
probably move you into Marco's room.

31:59.616 --> 32:02.184
Oh, so I can go from one
closeted gay guy to another?

32:03.119 --> 32:04.320
No thanks.

32:05.655 --> 32:07.756
[clears throat] Can we talk?

32:08.592 --> 32:09.792
Yeah.

32:11.228 --> 32:14.530
So, I've been thinking about what you said.

32:14.564 --> 32:16.499
And you were right.

32:16.533 --> 32:19.969
I was too concerned about
what other people think.

32:21.271 --> 32:24.139
But I'm more concerned about losing you.

32:24.174 --> 32:27.810
- You can't have it both ways.
- I know.

32:28.945 --> 32:30.913
That's why I was wondering...

32:30.947 --> 32:32.681
...if you would like to dance.

32:33.483 --> 32:34.483
Here?

32:36.686 --> 32:38.687
Um, there's no one dancing.

32:39.990 --> 32:43.993
So who better to get it
started than two hot princes?

32:47.998 --> 32:49.365
You sure your ready for this?

32:49.399 --> 32:51.200
Yeah.

32:51.234 --> 32:53.302
[soft music plays]

32:53.336 --> 32:58.874
* I fell so hard for you *

33:04.014 --> 33:09.585
* There's nothing that I can do *

33:11.154 --> 33:12.855
Uh, what are they doing?

33:14.591 --> 33:15.791
Dancing.

33:15.825 --> 33:18.627
- * They say that you *
- With each other?

33:18.662 --> 33:20.496
- * Learn from mistakes *
- They're your brothers.

33:20.530 --> 33:21.997
Get out there and support them.

33:24.768 --> 33:26.936
* But you gave to me *

33:26.970 --> 33:28.704
- Do you want to dance...?
- With girls, yes!

33:28.738 --> 33:32.141
- All right, good.
- * No other way *

33:36.279 --> 33:41.050
* And you *

33:41.084 --> 33:43.218
* Couldn't stay *

33:43.253 --> 33:46.589
- * Stay for a while *
- * Stay for a while *

33:50.560 --> 33:54.697
* Yeah, ooh *

33:57.400 --> 34:00.903
Brilliant idea to try to
navigate by the stars, Rebecca.

34:00.937 --> 34:04.073
Well, at least I know Orion wears a belt,
not a scarf, Rapunzel.

34:04.107 --> 34:06.408
Can we try to be nice to each other?

34:06.443 --> 34:08.177
At least until we get to the lodge.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.411
No one even knows we're out here.

34:10.447 --> 34:14.750
- Unless Casey told Cappie.
- I didn't tell Cappie anything, OK?

34:14.784 --> 34:16.185
And it's probably for the best.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.853
What's that mean?

34:17.887 --> 34:19.888
You said it yourself,
I can't tell him about this.

34:19.922 --> 34:21.422
I have to be realistic.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.759
Something's going on with him
and he won't tell me about it.

34:23.793 --> 34:26.027
OK, I need to tell you something.

34:26.062 --> 34:29.898
There's a reason it didn't
work out with Fisher.

34:32.002 --> 34:34.902
- Uh, he cheated on me again.
- What?

34:34.938 --> 34:37.339
I went to go visit him for New Year's,

34:37.373 --> 34:39.708
where I met his family and his friends.

34:39.743 --> 34:44.246
And then... I met his other girlfriend.

34:47.516 --> 34:50.018
You deserve so much better.

34:51.254 --> 34:54.922
- That son of a bitch.
- I'm so sorry, Ash.

34:54.958 --> 34:58.727
- I just feel stupid.
- We should burn down his house.

34:58.762 --> 35:01.163
[chuckling]

35:01.197 --> 35:04.266
So I just don't think that
I was in the right place

35:04.300 --> 35:05.968
to be giving you advice.

35:06.002 --> 35:09.038
Just because Fisher's a jerk doesn't
mean that you can't count on Cappie.

35:09.072 --> 35:11.907
But stuff's going to keep coming up.

35:11.941 --> 35:16.545
Hopefully not accidental arson,
but things happen in life.

35:16.579 --> 35:20.849
If we can't share things,
what are we to each other?

35:26.154 --> 35:28.589
[rock music plays]

35:33.023 --> 35:35.959
- How long do we have to stay?
- Five minutes.

35:38.462 --> 35:40.430
* Too much love in you, my dear *

35:40.464 --> 35:46.035
* I would sing you a verse in tears,
now *

35:46.070 --> 35:48.471
Make it ten.

35:48.506 --> 35:50.907
- * I see inside, a beating heart *
- Your highness.

35:52.843 --> 35:54.477
I feared you'd been eaten by a dragon.

35:54.512 --> 35:57.280
Or, you know, just gone to Dobler's.

35:57.314 --> 35:59.349
The girls and I had to do something first.

36:01.652 --> 36:02.752
Let's go talk.

36:04.088 --> 36:06.356
* You're scared... *

36:07.424 --> 36:09.225
Look, I know something's been bugging you

36:09.260 --> 36:11.761
and you feel like you
can't tell me about it.

36:11.795 --> 36:14.898
I've been a little preoccupied
myself and it took your brother,

36:14.932 --> 36:16.900
of all people, to make me realize it.

36:18.302 --> 36:21.538
Wade's gone and I was responsible.

36:23.107 --> 36:27.043
I trusted Evan and got screwed.

36:27.077 --> 36:30.480
And I keep pretending that
everything's the same,

36:30.514 --> 36:34.050
but it's not and that sucks.

36:34.084 --> 36:35.852
But the only thing that makes this OK

36:35.886 --> 36:38.087
is that I have you to talk to about it.

36:38.122 --> 36:41.124
So I'm sorry if I seem distant or...

36:41.158 --> 36:43.126
I burned down the Gamma Psi house!

36:43.160 --> 36:45.028
- What?
- After SongFest,

36:45.062 --> 36:46.529
we went over there to
find Katherine's clipboard

36:46.564 --> 36:48.264
but it was dark so Rebecca
lit a Jasmine candle

36:48.299 --> 36:50.033
and then Hot Fireman confirmed it was us.

36:50.067 --> 36:52.101
But we got away with it until
Ashleigh kept the clipboard

36:52.136 --> 36:54.604
and you can't put it in your trunk because
of Scrubs.

36:54.638 --> 36:58.374
So we buried it and I lost my tiara!

36:58.409 --> 37:03.379
Oh, my God. - I know.
I know. I know, I know.

37:03.414 --> 37:06.716
Oh, there, there, my little Firestarter.

37:06.750 --> 37:09.185
- It's not funny!
- I'm wearing tights,

37:09.220 --> 37:10.386
I think I know funny.

37:11.689 --> 37:14.457
Look, I know it may seem
like the biggest deal

37:14.491 --> 37:17.493
in the world right now,
but it was an accident.

37:17.528 --> 37:21.030
And someday it'll just
be a really good story.

37:24.602 --> 37:27.637
I'm sorry about Wade and the guys.

37:27.671 --> 37:30.406
But you know it's not
your fault. It's Evan's.

37:30.441 --> 37:32.308
And you know the Gamma Psis will be fine.

37:32.343 --> 37:34.644
There's like a hundred
bucks in that wishing well.

37:34.678 --> 37:37.647
Well, $99.25. I had to get
quarters for the laundry.

37:37.681 --> 37:40.516
- Don't tell anybody.
- You stole from the wishing well?

37:40.551 --> 37:43.086
I'm not the one who burned
down their house, little lady.

37:46.090 --> 37:48.891
You know, I thought,
when we got back together,

37:48.926 --> 37:54.430
everything would somehow
become magically... easy.

37:55.366 --> 37:57.066
Happily ever after?

37:57.768 --> 37:59.669
That is so boring.

The better to ask you to dance with.

Really?

Do you know what I hate
most about fairy tales?

39:16.914 --> 39:18.614
They set up false expectations.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.917
In the originals,
Prince Charming didn't always

39:20.951 --> 39:23.186
sweep you off your feet. It's so unreal.

39:23.220 --> 39:24.620
Like love.

39:24.655 --> 39:26.689
The only time that ever
works is in the movies.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.961
Yeah, what's so great about
Prince Charming anyway?

experience for the pledge class.

How'd you get them to do it?

40:54.445 --> 40:55.745
I think seeing me yell at you

40:55.779 --> 40:57.046
really made an impression on them.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.048
And slicing off one of their toes, probably.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.450
They got the room done, didn't they?
