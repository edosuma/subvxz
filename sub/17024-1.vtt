WEBVTT

00:55.546 --> 00:56.646
We have an 18-year old male

00:56.648 --> 01:00.149
with gunshot wounds
to the leg and shoulder.

01:00.151 --> 01:02.285
1, 2, 3.

01:09.459 --> 01:11.660
Yep. He's on something.

01:11.662 --> 01:15.464
Jason.
I need to talk to Jason.

01:15.932 --> 01:19.501
Soon. Just not now.

01:21.537 --> 01:23.505
Get her into pre-op.

01:27.610 --> 01:29.611
How did you get in?

01:29.613 --> 01:31.313
I... I heard the gunshots,

01:31.315 --> 01:34.348
and I rushed to the back door.

01:37.519 --> 01:39.654
What'd you do to Jason?

01:39.656 --> 01:41.122
Huh?

01:41.124 --> 01:42.523
Can I see a doctor?

01:42.525 --> 01:44.392
Baby, the police are outside.

01:44.394 --> 01:47.194
And if you're up to it,
they want to talk to you.

01:47.196 --> 01:48.663
I'll take care of Ashley,
Mr. Lane.

01:48.665 --> 01:50.398
Thank you, brother.

02:03.377 --> 02:05.111
So...

02:05.413 --> 02:07.180
How did you end up

02:07.182 --> 02:10.449
at your brother's girlfriend's
house last night?

02:10.452 --> 02:11.952
We were working on...

02:11.954 --> 02:13.453
Christmas costumes
for my play.

02:13.455 --> 02:16.957
Where'd you get the money
we found in your possession?

02:16.959 --> 02:19.059
We were raising that money

02:19.061 --> 02:20.293
at the garage sale yesterday.

02:20.295 --> 02:25.264
See, this past fall,
things had gotten pretty bad...

02:25.266 --> 02:27.466
at school,

02:27.468 --> 02:29.301
at home.

02:29.436 --> 02:31.637
This year's production,

02:31.639 --> 02:34.373
<i>Holiday cheer,</i>
has been penned

02:34.375 --> 02:36.642
by yours truly.

02:40.246 --> 02:41.547
All right,
so when I call your name,

02:41.549 --> 02:44.416
just come up to the stage
and state the part

02:44.418 --> 02:46.485
you'll be reading.

02:46.487 --> 02:49.620
Uh, Monica Tishauer.

02:56.028 --> 02:58.629
I'll be reading for Betty,

02:58.631 --> 02:59.764
the garbage girl.

02:59.766 --> 03:04.602
Just look at what
I found in my garbage truck.

03:04.604 --> 03:07.038
I'll have the best decorated

03:07.040 --> 03:09.374
house in town.

03:12.712 --> 03:14.679
This is garbage.

03:15.013 --> 03:18.215
Ashley Lane?

03:19.350 --> 03:22.352
Ashley Lane?

03:23.354 --> 03:26.456
People,
time is of the essence.

03:26.458 --> 03:30.494
Last call for Ashley Lane.

03:33.231 --> 03:35.432
Right.

03:36.034 --> 03:38.435
Karen Snow?

03:57.587 --> 03:58.754
Idiot.

03:58.756 --> 03:59.588
How will you know

03:59.590 --> 04:00.790
if you will ever do anything

04:00.792 --> 04:03.426
if you can
never do anything?

04:09.365 --> 04:11.466
How'd it go?

04:11.468 --> 04:12.667
It went.

04:12.669 --> 04:16.571
I decided that
I didn't have time. So...

04:16.572 --> 04:17.772
should at least try.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.607
Yeah? You didn't.

04:19.608 --> 04:21.309
It's gonna be stupid anyway.

04:21.310 --> 04:23.178
Oh, but Ms. Lane,

04:23.180 --> 04:25.480
you'd be missing out
on such a wonderful

04:25.482 --> 04:27.382
high school experience.

04:27.384 --> 04:30.285
Nicki, drop dead.

04:35.223 --> 04:36.356
<i>Listen closely <i></i></i>

04:36.358 --> 04:40.828
<i>or you'll never
hear me whisper <i></i></i>

04:40.830 --> 04:42.663
<i>All the pretty things <i></i></i>

04:42.665 --> 04:47.167
<i>I'm scared
to say out loud <i></i></i>

04:47.368 --> 04:48.535
<i>in my mind I know <i></i></i>

04:48.537 --> 04:52.206
<i>all I can do is kiss you <i></i></i>

04:52.208 --> 04:58.811
<i>but I'm caught between
the curtain and the crowd <i></i></i>

04:59.713 --> 05:01.581
- Forgot to pick up Jason.
- Ah.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.150
He's been waiting
a half an hour.

05:04.152 --> 05:08.387
Well, he's 17.
He'll get over it.

05:08.755 --> 05:12.458
Would it bother you so much
if it was Ashley I forgot?

05:12.460 --> 05:14.127
Forget about it.
I'm going.

05:14.129 --> 05:15.261
I'm going.

05:15.263 --> 05:17.396
Thank you, Bill.

05:21.335 --> 05:24.703
How about let's just have an
early dinner tonight, huh, baby?

05:24.705 --> 05:25.770
Uh, tonight's no good.

05:25.772 --> 05:29.541
I already made plans
with Phyllis and Claire.

05:29.543 --> 05:31.343
Maybe next time.

05:32.612 --> 05:34.913
Okey, dokey.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.264
I know...

05:56.735 --> 05:57.768
Drive you home?

05:57.770 --> 06:00.704
No, it's okay, Mr. Lane.
I gotta meet someone.

06:00.706 --> 06:03.908
But, uh, catch y'all later.

06:13.885 --> 06:15.418
Fasten your seatbelt.

06:15.420 --> 06:19.355
It wasn't me.
It was Nicki. Mm-Hmm.

06:28.232 --> 06:29.832
I think your mother...

06:29.834 --> 06:32.402
You mean your wife?

06:32.404 --> 06:36.439
You've got to stop
hanging out with Nicole.

06:42.312 --> 06:43.312
When we get home,

06:43.314 --> 06:46.348
I want you to put those
clothes in the laundry.

06:46.350 --> 06:48.517
They smell like smoke.

06:49.886 --> 06:52.221
I saw that.

07:09.571 --> 07:11.672
Geez!

07:11.674 --> 07:13.007
Who reeks in here?

07:13.009 --> 07:16.644
This must be you,
Ashtray Lane, right?

07:18.548 --> 07:21.349
So Jason, how was practice?

07:21.351 --> 07:23.618
Brutal.

07:23.785 --> 07:25.419
Captain hit the hurdle
full-On.

07:25.421 --> 07:27.255
He's probably
out for the season.

07:27.257 --> 07:31.291
But hopefully I get my shot
at being captain now.

07:31.293 --> 07:32.959
Really?

07:32.961 --> 07:34.961
It could happen.
Right?

07:34.963 --> 07:37.564
I mean, who else
would coach pick, anyway?

07:37.566 --> 07:41.668
Someone with better grades.

07:42.637 --> 07:46.306
<i>Father, lay your hand
upon my head <i></i></i>

07:46.308 --> 07:51.311
<i>I said it's
only consolation <i></i></i>

07:53.913 --> 07:56.915
<i>Although we
have the same disease <i></i></i>

07:56.917 --> 08:02.388
<i>I'm afraid we may
need different medication <i></i></i>

08:02.722 --> 08:03.789
Where's mom?

08:03.791 --> 08:05.758
At some committee thing.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.425
Right.

08:06.427 --> 08:07.993
Yo. Think fast, brainless.

08:09.463 --> 08:12.064
<i>Sit down <i></i></i>

08:12.066 --> 08:13.065
<i>and...<i></i></i>

08:13.067 --> 08:15.334
Hey, where you going?

08:15.336 --> 08:15.768
Uh...

08:15.770 --> 08:19.470
Just gonna go meet up
and study with Angel tonight.

08:19.472 --> 08:20.605
Look, uh...

08:20.607 --> 08:22.607
If I don't get off probation
this semester,

08:22.609 --> 08:23.541
then I can't run track.

08:23.543 --> 08:27.378
And we both know how disappointed
that would make mom, right?

08:27.380 --> 08:28.980
Yeah. Sorry.

08:28.982 --> 08:31.082
Where're your books?

08:31.084 --> 08:33.618
<i>so relax <i></i></i>

08:33.986 --> 08:37.087
<i>sit down <i></i></i>

08:37.090 --> 08:38.956
<i>and talk to...<i></i></i>

08:38.957 --> 08:42.626
I'm gonna
go get some chicken.

08:43.929 --> 08:45.829
Anybody...

08:45.831 --> 08:47.831
wanna come?

08:47.833 --> 08:50.434
Nicki, big surprise...

08:50.436 --> 08:51.535
Sharon is out.

08:51.537 --> 08:53.904
And all I have to do
is homework and laundry.

08:53.906 --> 08:55.405
Dad's picking up dinner.

08:55.407 --> 08:57.407
So you're alone?

08:57.409 --> 08:58.875
Cain's club time.

08:58.877 --> 08:59.976
Uh, I don't...

08:59.978 --> 09:02.446
he's gonna be back.

09:02.448 --> 09:03.013
So?

09:03.015 --> 09:05.082
Just leave him a note.

09:05.783 --> 09:08.618
Okay, meet me in 15.

09:37.646 --> 09:39.047
Hey, there.

09:39.049 --> 09:40.081
Hey.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.583
What's your name?

09:41.585 --> 09:43.918
They all go off
and leave you?

09:43.920 --> 09:44.753
Willy, huh?

09:48.824 --> 09:50.825
Thank you very much.

09:50.827 --> 09:53.595
We just met.

09:57.566 --> 09:59.567
Wanna come out and play?

09:59.569 --> 10:00.934
Huh?

10:00.936 --> 10:02.669
Come on.

10:12.815 --> 10:13.547
Billy.

10:13.549 --> 10:15.816
Come on.

10:22.957 --> 10:25.192
You...

10:25.194 --> 10:27.593
You really stink.

10:27.595 --> 10:29.929
We have to work on that.

10:37.472 --> 10:39.138
Nice.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.877
I've got to go.

10:45.446 --> 10:47.547
But I'll be back.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.850
See you later.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.619
So this beats
doing laundry, huh?

10:54.621 --> 10:56.822
I mean, just a little?

10:56.956 --> 10:59.925
I can't find my cigarettes.

11:00.693 --> 11:04.796
You and your dad
not so disney these days.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.864
Sharon and me...

11:05.866 --> 11:09.501
like a total train wreck.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.607
You got a light?

11:16.942 --> 11:19.477
Have we met before?

11:19.479 --> 11:23.514
Trust me...
if we had, you'd remember.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.882
Dance?

11:52.142 --> 11:54.143
Hey, Jason!

12:10.026 --> 12:11.159
First timers.

12:11.161 --> 12:13.595
Hey. Keep it down.

12:14.565 --> 12:16.899
I got money.

12:16.901 --> 12:17.933
Um...

12:17.935 --> 12:20.135
I was just going
down to Angel's.

12:20.137 --> 12:21.837
You could drop me off there.

12:21.839 --> 12:24.773
I am...

12:24.775 --> 12:27.009
Superman.

12:27.011 --> 12:28.677
I can do anything.

12:28.679 --> 12:30.612
Man, you...
you blew me away

12:30.614 --> 12:32.014
At practice today.

12:32.016 --> 12:33.147
You think maybe, uh...

12:33.149 --> 12:35.683
You could teach me
to do distance?

12:36.319 --> 12:40.121
I'm not
a miracle worker, baby.

12:41.057 --> 12:42.323
Just superman.

12:42.325 --> 12:43.991
Go ahead, Jazz.

12:43.993 --> 12:45.626
I'll advance you...

12:45.628 --> 12:47.028
Again.

12:49.031 --> 12:51.265
Hey, hey, hey.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.568
That's... that's mine.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.803
Rich boy's good for it.

12:56.104 --> 12:59.239
Nobody gets deep into me.

13:12.621 --> 13:15.088
I still owe you?

13:15.090 --> 13:19.192
You jocks aren't very good
with numbers, are you?

13:19.194 --> 13:20.093
$120.

13:20.095 --> 13:22.729
What?! I... I just
gave you a hundred.

13:22.731 --> 13:25.097
You haven't give me Jack.

13:25.099 --> 13:28.734
Your parties are never
gonna be on me.

13:28.969 --> 13:30.803
I'll get it to you, G.

13:30.805 --> 13:32.605
Tomorrow, Jazz.

13:32.607 --> 13:34.239
And forget about Angel.

13:34.241 --> 13:36.875
She doesn't own you.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.227
Hello?

14:02.368 --> 14:05.036
Wait a minute.

14:07.374 --> 14:08.740
This isn't...

14:08.742 --> 14:11.676
This isn't the washroom.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.418
Hello?

14:21.753 --> 14:27.257
You know, this isn't exactly the best
neighborhood to be passing out in.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.027
Where's your date?

14:30.695 --> 14:34.698
I'm not allowed to date.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.868
I am a princess.

14:39.403 --> 14:43.005
Shh.

14:46.044 --> 14:47.943
Oh...

15:00.023 --> 15:02.458
All right,
let's get you home.

15:15.371 --> 15:18.373
What... great... hair.

15:32.854 --> 15:34.388
Whoo.

15:35.890 --> 15:37.725
Yay.

15:46.202 --> 15:50.504
Well, princess,
where do you live?

15:51.339 --> 15:53.307
At home.

15:56.810 --> 16:00.046
Would you like to kiss me?

16:00.048 --> 16:03.516
Definitely not.

16:03.518 --> 16:05.785
Why not?

16:05.787 --> 16:07.253
Am I ugly?

16:07.255 --> 16:08.421
No.

16:08.423 --> 16:11.090
Your breath stinks.

16:11.092 --> 16:12.992
I like you, too.

16:12.994 --> 16:14.927
Look, I've got to be at work
early tomorrow,

16:14.929 --> 16:18.798
and if you want a ride home,
just tell me where you live.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.500
Otherwise, out of the van.

16:22.835 --> 16:27.339
5... 3... 3...

16:27.341 --> 16:30.809
Parkwood drive.

16:32.111 --> 16:33.979
You know...

16:33.981 --> 16:36.782
You're not very nice.

16:36.784 --> 16:38.416
I am <i>not</i>

16:38.418 --> 16:41.853
Going to dance with you.

16:44.023 --> 16:45.056
Hey, baby.

16:45.058 --> 16:46.056
Hey.

16:46.058 --> 16:47.424
How was dinner?

16:47.426 --> 16:50.361
Didn't go too well.

16:53.231 --> 16:54.031
I missed you.

16:54.033 --> 16:55.466
Did you have a good time?

16:56.169 --> 16:58.269
We were trying to motivate
the denby company

16:58.271 --> 17:01.539
to conform to green standards.
Mm-Hmm.

17:01.541 --> 17:04.175
I have been working,

17:04.176 --> 17:06.010
and I am tired.

17:06.012 --> 17:07.344
I'm green.

17:07.346 --> 17:09.180
Did you feed that dog?

17:09.182 --> 17:10.946
Ah...

17:10.949 --> 17:12.147
I told Jason to do it.

17:12.150 --> 17:14.217
The dog is not Jason's
little brother.

17:14.219 --> 17:16.185
And it's not gonna make up
for the fact

17:16.188 --> 17:19.355
That we don't
have a child together.

17:21.392 --> 17:22.525
Wow.

17:33.370 --> 17:35.038
What are you doing?

17:37.141 --> 17:40.175
I thought you were
in your room not feeling well.

17:40.177 --> 17:40.943
I am not.

17:40.945 --> 17:42.344
Where have you been?

17:42.346 --> 17:43.378
And what are you wearing?!

17:43.380 --> 17:45.981
That's too many questions.

17:45.983 --> 17:49.218
I only do one
at a time, okay?

17:49.220 --> 17:51.186
It is not okay.

17:51.188 --> 17:53.055
Are you drunk?

17:53.057 --> 17:53.622
You been drinking?

17:53.624 --> 17:54.923
Oh, give it
a rest, Sharon.

17:54.925 --> 17:56.291
I seem to remember you
getting hammered

17:56.293 --> 17:58.260
A time or two
when you were younger.

17:58.262 --> 18:00.562
Come here, baby.

18:00.564 --> 18:01.430
Okay, daddy.

18:01.432 --> 18:02.864
Put your hand around daddy.

18:02.866 --> 18:04.232
Oh...
real neat.

18:04.234 --> 18:05.900
I love you.
I know.

18:05.902 --> 18:09.537
Can I have some
cookies and milk?

18:12.107 --> 18:15.610
You know you're
better than this.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.248
I wish I had a real mom.

18:37.999 --> 18:42.302
You remind me so much
of Amanda.

18:42.937 --> 18:45.672
My little princess.

18:49.176 --> 18:51.044
Sharon hates me.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.979
Oh, no she doesn't.

18:53.981 --> 18:56.649
She does not hate you.

18:56.651 --> 18:58.017
She just gets disappointed

18:58.019 --> 19:01.420
When you do things
like tonight.

19:02.923 --> 19:05.457
I'm disappointed, too.

19:05.592 --> 19:08.961
But I still love you.

19:14.067 --> 19:17.036
Good night, princess.

19:18.170 --> 19:22.340
Why do you
disappoint Sharon, daddy?

20:12.724 --> 20:14.323
Whoa.

20:14.325 --> 20:17.526
Who beat you up last night?

20:17.661 --> 20:21.197
You look like trash.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.000
No response?

20:24.002 --> 20:27.269
Okay. Cool.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.407
Oh, yeah. Here you go.

20:31.409 --> 20:33.309
Want some breakfast?

20:33.510 --> 20:35.276
You can have as much
as you want.

20:35.278 --> 20:37.178
I made enough for everybody.

20:37.180 --> 20:40.215
What?

20:46.222 --> 20:47.622
Okay.

20:47.624 --> 20:49.190
More for me.

21:00.168 --> 21:02.436
I actually feel better.

21:02.438 --> 21:03.470
I bet you do.

21:03.472 --> 21:05.706
Just wanna die now.

21:05.708 --> 21:08.675
Well, here's a little
trick I learned.

21:10.780 --> 21:11.779
Peppermint schnapps.

21:11.781 --> 21:13.747
Drink some of this.

21:13.749 --> 21:16.450
You'll feel better.
Come on.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.390
Ooh. Oh, that's good.

21:28.563 --> 21:30.296
I owe you.

21:30.298 --> 21:32.398
Ah, actually,

21:32.400 --> 21:35.068
Funny that you say that.

21:35.070 --> 21:35.735
I, uh...

21:35.737 --> 21:38.137
Could use some money
right now.

21:38.139 --> 21:39.672
Hmm.
Hmm.

21:39.674 --> 21:43.242
You and everybody else.

21:45.712 --> 21:46.746
Y... what?

21:46.748 --> 21:48.481
What am I supposed
to do with $5?

21:48.483 --> 21:51.783
- I can't...
- Good morning.

21:51.785 --> 21:52.384
Jay,

21:52.386 --> 21:53.585
Haven't seen you
in a while.

21:53.587 --> 21:55.220
What's been
keeping <i>you</i> busy?

21:55.222 --> 21:57.322
That was your fault
last night, mom.

21:57.324 --> 21:58.723
What are you talking about?

21:58.725 --> 22:01.193
While you were at your
meeting thing,

22:01.195 --> 22:03.795
I was hittin' the books.

22:04.831 --> 22:06.531
All right, um,

22:06.533 --> 22:07.466
I happen to be free tonight

22:07.468 --> 22:09.334
If you wanna go grab dinner
or something,

22:09.336 --> 22:10.435
Just the two of us.
You're on.

22:10.437 --> 22:13.371
I'll pick you up after practice.
All right.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.506
Bye, baby.

22:14.508 --> 22:16.707
Feel better.

22:29.855 --> 22:31.755
Sharon.

22:33.191 --> 22:35.426
About last night...

22:35.428 --> 22:36.627
I'm sorry.

22:36.629 --> 22:37.461
I guess I just...

22:37.463 --> 22:40.430
Makin' a play
for your father's attention?

22:40.432 --> 22:42.232
Again?

22:42.566 --> 22:43.566
I'm just trying to...

22:43.568 --> 22:45.535
Well I'm trying
to keep peace

22:45.537 --> 22:46.603
For your father's sake.

22:46.605 --> 22:48.738
Can't you at least do that?

22:48.740 --> 22:51.608
Keep peace?
Mm-Hmm.

22:52.543 --> 22:53.743
Yeah.

22:53.745 --> 22:55.545
Yeah, I can...
I can do that.

22:55.547 --> 22:58.281
Good.

23:14.564 --> 23:16.565
"Good morning, dad."

23:16.567 --> 23:17.799
Hello, kids.

23:21.504 --> 23:23.639
"I'll make you
coffee, dad."

23:23.641 --> 23:25.541
Thank you, honey.

23:30.313 --> 23:31.913
"I'll do the dishes, dad."

23:31.915 --> 23:34.248
Thank you, Jason.

23:40.222 --> 23:42.657
Make it strong, Bill.

23:42.659 --> 23:44.892
Make it strong.

23:59.207 --> 24:01.474
What is that?

24:01.742 --> 24:03.710
Here you go.
Thank you, baby.

24:03.712 --> 24:04.744
You're welcome.

24:04.746 --> 24:05.712
Sharon?
Yeah.

24:05.714 --> 24:08.682
Could we agree
to cut down on some things?

24:08.684 --> 24:09.883
I'm not spending
anything extra.

24:09.885 --> 24:13.253
No, but your lunches and your
dinners with your friends

24:13.255 --> 24:13.820
really add up.

24:13.822 --> 24:15.922
Maybe if you did something
with a future?

24:15.924 --> 24:18.458
Lane publishing
was daddy's baby.

24:18.460 --> 24:19.893
But not ours.

24:19.895 --> 24:22.962
Your lobbying job
pays practically nothing.

24:22.964 --> 24:25.831
Well, at least I'm
contributing to society.

24:25.833 --> 24:30.336
I'd like you to contribute
more to our finances.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.472
This house is worth
less than half

24:33.474 --> 24:34.340
Of what we paid for it.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.008
Were are serious
underwater, baby.

24:36.010 --> 24:38.911
You're not thinking
of selling it, are you?

24:38.913 --> 24:39.612
We can't.

24:39.614 --> 24:42.681
We don't have enough equity
to pay off the mortgage.

24:43.951 --> 24:44.817
I'll get it.

24:44.819 --> 24:46.619
I was on my way out,
anyway.

24:46.621 --> 24:48.686
Have a nice day.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.522
Hi, there.
I noticed you might

24:51.524 --> 24:54.392
Need some maintenance
work done.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.995
Bill!

25:01.834 --> 25:02.467
Hi.

25:02.469 --> 25:05.003
Uh, what can I do for you?

25:05.005 --> 25:06.004
I hope I can help you.

25:06.006 --> 25:08.506
I just finished several jobs
for you neighbors.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.975
Uh, the Alexanders,
Proudfoots,

25:10.977 --> 25:11.776
and Mr. Wilson.

25:11.778 --> 25:15.279
They can all tell you about my work.
Mmm.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.880
Thanks, but I really...

25:16.882 --> 25:18.749
If I may. Uh...

25:18.751 --> 25:20.017
Some areas...

25:21.453 --> 25:24.454
Need serious repair.

25:25.923 --> 25:26.723
I know. Believe me.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.358
Uh, look, thanks,
but I can't...

25:28.360 --> 25:30.661
I can't really "afford"
any...

25:30.663 --> 25:31.495
Extra help right now.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.997
I'm a good worker
and I'm open to barter.

25:33.999 --> 25:37.867
Uh... what do you
have in trade?

26:02.858 --> 26:03.558
Nicki,

26:03.560 --> 26:05.060
How did I get home
last night?

26:05.062 --> 26:06.761
<i>I don't know, but...</i>

26:06.763 --> 26:09.664
<i>I got home
in a '65 mustang.</i>

26:09.666 --> 26:10.732
<i>Are you home now?</i>

26:10.734 --> 26:12.534
And hung over.

26:12.536 --> 26:14.869
<i>You lush.</i>

26:14.871 --> 26:18.773
<i>Meet me at
"hooker on a stump."</i> Okay.

26:23.846 --> 26:25.680
Whoa.

26:25.682 --> 26:26.881
Nice shoes.

26:26.883 --> 26:29.650
School let out early today?

26:29.652 --> 26:31.385
And you are?

26:31.387 --> 26:31.785
Mac.

26:31.787 --> 26:35.022
Dad hired me
to work on the house.

26:35.024 --> 26:36.623
Brilliant.

26:36.625 --> 26:37.958
I'm just on my way

26:37.960 --> 26:40.961
To audition
for a christmas play.

26:41.596 --> 26:44.765
When you see my dad,
will you tell him that?

26:44.767 --> 26:47.000
And that I'll
be a little late.

26:47.002 --> 26:48.502
Okay?

27:08.789 --> 27:10.823
Hey. Oh.

27:10.825 --> 27:11.991
Hey.

27:11.993 --> 27:14.727
Do you wanna go
to a house party tonight?

27:14.729 --> 27:16.763
Sharon's too burned.

27:16.765 --> 27:17.597
I have to be back home

27:17.599 --> 27:19.831
before she and Jason
get back from dinner.

27:19.833 --> 27:21.733
Just come for a little while.

27:21.735 --> 27:22.701
But you're, uh,

27:22.703 --> 27:23.702
gonna have to wear something

27:23.704 --> 27:26.004
a <i>little</i> better than that.

27:26.806 --> 27:27.773
No money.

27:28.809 --> 27:30.675
You know... come here.

27:30.677 --> 27:34.546
You don't have to always
pay for everything.

27:36.115 --> 27:37.449
Nicki,

27:37.451 --> 27:38.483
You shoplift?

27:39.019 --> 27:41.653
Where do you think
I get all my stuff?

27:45.857 --> 27:47.158
Hello, Angelina.

27:48.594 --> 27:49.593
Hi, Mr. L.

27:49.595 --> 27:52.963
Um, I made this shirt
for Jason.

27:52.965 --> 27:53.898
I hand-embroidered it.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.467
You don't think it's
too feminine, do you?

27:56.469 --> 27:59.203
No. It reminds me
of what i used to wear.

27:59.205 --> 28:01.772
Jason's having dinner
with his mother.

28:01.774 --> 28:02.606
Really?
Yeah.

28:02.608 --> 28:05.709
You don't have to lie
if he's with another girl.

28:05.711 --> 28:07.845
Oh. Come in.

28:07.847 --> 28:08.579
So,

28:08.581 --> 28:09.879
What makes you think

28:09.881 --> 28:12.782
he wouldn't be having dinner
with his mother?

28:12.784 --> 28:14.117
I never see him anymore.

28:14.119 --> 28:15.785
Saw him last night.

28:15.787 --> 28:17.754
Or doesn't studying
count anymore?

28:17.756 --> 28:22.125
No, I haven't seen Jason
in 2 weeks.

28:22.793 --> 28:26.162
New friends
are such scumbags.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.499
What new friends
you talking about?

28:29.501 --> 28:31.134
Did Jason make this?

28:31.136 --> 28:31.968
Yes, he did.

28:31.970 --> 28:35.070
That was his christmas present
to me last year.

28:35.072 --> 28:38.807
He made me a beautiful
jewelry box.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.779
You know we plan to have
our own business someday?

28:43.781 --> 28:46.515
Me doing the whole
clothes-design thing,

28:46.517 --> 28:48.984
and Jason doing his woodwork.

28:48.986 --> 28:49.551
Nice.

28:49.553 --> 28:52.688
So maybe he's been
spending more time at the shop.

28:52.690 --> 28:53.856
Nice try.

28:53.858 --> 28:56.859
But they haven't seen him
in over a month.

28:56.861 --> 29:00.928
He even left a rocker
he was working on half-finished.

29:00.930 --> 29:03.965
I don't know what
to tell you, baby.

29:03.967 --> 29:06.100
Well, just give him this.

29:06.102 --> 29:07.134
I'll have a talk with him.

29:07.136 --> 29:11.706
No. I'm the one that needs
to have a talk with im.

29:13.108 --> 29:14.842
You're really okay, Mr. L.

29:14.844 --> 29:16.677
Thank you.

29:16.679 --> 29:18.179
Sometimes I wonder.

29:19.749 --> 29:22.283
Okay, well,
I'm gonna go.

29:23.919 --> 29:26.720
Have a good day, baby.
Thanks.

29:26.722 --> 29:29.956
So, what's been
keeping my track star

29:29.958 --> 29:31.191
away from home so much?

29:31.193 --> 29:33.793
It's not a girl, is it?

29:33.795 --> 29:34.694
No, uh-Uh.

29:34.696 --> 29:35.762
As a matter of fact,

29:35.764 --> 29:38.865
I stood up Angel last night
so I could study.

29:38.867 --> 29:41.134
You're still seeing her?

29:42.070 --> 29:44.671
Does her mother
still work at wal-mart?

29:44.673 --> 29:45.805
Whoa! Mom, for real?

29:45.807 --> 29:47.007
Come on... her mom's cool,
all right?

29:47.009 --> 29:50.210
I mean, besides, I might need
to get a job there, myself.

29:50.212 --> 29:51.043
You get an allowance.

29:51.045 --> 29:53.846
Yeah, but dad's cutting back
till I get my grades up.

29:53.848 --> 29:55.881
I need money <i>now.</i>

29:55.883 --> 29:56.982
For what?

29:56.984 --> 29:59.318
Something wrong?

29:59.320 --> 30:00.052
Nuh. Uh.

30:00.054 --> 30:02.154
My cross trainers
just gettin' old.

30:02.156 --> 30:04.156
I forgot.

30:04.158 --> 30:09.295
At your age, things get old
5 minutes ago, right? Mmm?

30:09.829 --> 30:11.864
How much you need, baby?

30:11.866 --> 30:14.133
350.

30:14.901 --> 30:16.968
For cross trainers?

30:16.970 --> 30:17.669
Well, I mean,

30:17.671 --> 30:19.604
The whole team's gettin'
these leather jackets, right?

30:19.606 --> 30:21.339
I guess I could
settle for a nylon jacket,

30:21.341 --> 30:25.009
But I know you don't want your boy
rocking no nylon jacket at school.

30:25.011 --> 30:26.177
I only got 150, Jay.

30:26.179 --> 30:27.645
No, that's cool.
That's cool.

30:27.647 --> 30:28.680
That's enough for the shoes.

30:28.682 --> 30:30.949
But we can go shopping together
for that jacket, right?

30:30.951 --> 30:33.084
I mean, you...
you can charge it, right?

30:33.086 --> 30:35.687
Right.

30:36.923 --> 30:38.890
You're the best, mom.

30:40.694 --> 30:42.225
I love you, too, baby.

30:43.361 --> 30:45.929
So, baby, I <i>know</i> I haven't
been to the track meets lately,

30:45.931 --> 30:49.066
And I'm sorry, but you know I've been
working hard with this committee.

30:49.068 --> 30:50.100
You know? Go green.
Yeah.

30:50.102 --> 30:52.803
But I really wanna
talk to you about that Angel.

30:52.805 --> 30:54.705
What?
I don't like her.

30:54.707 --> 30:55.872
Huh?

30:55.874 --> 30:56.707
I just don't.

30:56.709 --> 30:59.209
I-I just feel like she's...
in the way of your future.

30:59.211 --> 31:02.346
She's needy.
She didn't even do anything to you.

31:02.348 --> 31:03.780
She's needy. Just saying.

31:03.782 --> 31:06.650
Okay, okay.
You need to try something new.

31:06.652 --> 31:08.751
New like what?
What's new?

31:08.753 --> 31:09.819
Keep it movin'. Com.

31:09.821 --> 31:11.954
What is that?
Did you just make that up?

31:11.956 --> 31:13.356
Well, maybe.

31:13.358 --> 31:17.226
Okay.
Might be a site with some new booty on it.

31:17.228 --> 31:19.028
Mom!

31:19.030 --> 31:20.329
Ahh.

31:20.331 --> 31:22.264
The jacket looks nice on you.
Right?

31:22.266 --> 31:25.735
Thank you.
Thank you to my mom.

31:27.304 --> 31:30.406
Why are you
sitting in the dark?

31:30.408 --> 31:31.941
Where were you last night?

31:31.943 --> 31:33.742
Uh... I-I was studying

31:33.744 --> 31:34.409
Like I told you.

31:34.411 --> 31:36.277
You haven seen Angelina
in weeks.

31:36.279 --> 31:38.713
I just figured that
studying with Angel would...

31:38.715 --> 31:41.850
Um, just distract me
a little bit.

31:41.852 --> 31:43.118
He already told me.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.086
Just where have you
been going?

31:45.088 --> 31:46.755
Bill...
I asked you a question.

31:46.757 --> 31:49.858
The library. What... a guy
tries to do the right thing,

31:49.860 --> 31:51.026
and I get jumped for it?

31:51.028 --> 31:53.228
Are you trying
to do the right thing?

31:53.230 --> 31:54.229
Yes...

31:54.231 --> 31:56.431
Your father's finished
with his questions.

31:56.433 --> 31:59.433
Go on upstairs
and study, baby.

32:03.938 --> 32:04.371
Well,

32:04.373 --> 32:07.141
You've managed to ruin
a perfectly lovely evening.

32:07.143 --> 32:11.045
<i>Just trying to make him
live up to his responsibilities.</i>

32:11.047 --> 32:13.347
<i>He only comes home
long enough to eat</i>

32:13.349 --> 32:14.715
And to ask for more money.

32:14.717 --> 32:17.151
Like your daughter's
home more?

32:17.153 --> 32:18.218
My son's an athlete,

32:18.220 --> 32:21.288
and one day he's
going to be important.

32:21.290 --> 32:24.123
He's important now, Sharon.

32:24.258 --> 32:25.958
Has it ever occurred to you
that Jason

32:25.960 --> 32:27.260
doesn't even
wanna be an athlete?

32:27.262 --> 32:29.462
Then why is he trying so hard
to make captain?

32:29.464 --> 32:31.264
He's not.
If you'd come to any

32:31.266 --> 32:33.032
of his track meets,
you'd know.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.333
He... he'll never be captain.

32:34.335 --> 32:35.702
Your daughter's the loser.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.071
And she dresses
like trailer trash.

32:38.973 --> 32:41.040
<i>If Ashley's mother
was home once in a while...</i>

32:41.042 --> 32:45.278
Oh, please.
I'm up in this dump more than i care to be.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.379
Charming.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.313
If a...
maybe,

32:47.315 --> 32:49.448
<i>Maybe if we
got this place together...</i>

32:49.450 --> 32:51.850
Let's get you back.

32:57.390 --> 32:59.725
No life, huh?

33:00.426 --> 33:02.294
This is gross.

33:03.096 --> 33:06.164
It may not look like
much now, but, uh,

33:06.166 --> 33:08.500
wait till I get the drapes up.

33:08.502 --> 33:10.969
This place is a hole.

33:12.505 --> 33:16.841
It just...
needs a little love.

33:20.212 --> 33:21.178
Yeah.

33:21.180 --> 33:24.281
Well, don't we all?

33:24.449 --> 33:26.917
Why don't you put this on?

33:26.919 --> 33:29.320
It's...

33:29.322 --> 33:31.522
Warmer.

33:34.393 --> 33:37.828
And why don't you
take care of willy?

33:39.864 --> 33:44.234
What, did you guys
buy out the entire store?

33:44.236 --> 33:46.503
Sneaking in again?

33:46.505 --> 33:48.838
I just fed willy.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.307
Thank you, baby.

33:53.210 --> 33:54.377
What was she wearing?

33:54.379 --> 33:58.181
Looked like it
was from a thrift store.

34:44.259 --> 34:45.259
Jason,
I need to talk to you!

34:45.261 --> 34:47.460
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather talk to my father?

34:47.463 --> 34:48.929
I came to see <i>you.</i>
You weren't home.

34:48.931 --> 34:50.998
Why'd you tell him we haven't
been studying together?

34:51.000 --> 34:53.266
I didn't know you told him we were.
Look, I...

34:53.268 --> 34:55.601
I just can't have any more
hassles right now.

34:55.603 --> 34:57.938
Don't shut me out.

34:58.472 --> 34:59.973
Mmm.

35:05.213 --> 35:06.580
Let's go somewhere.

35:06.582 --> 35:07.414
Is your mom home?

35:07.416 --> 35:09.316
She leaves for work
in about an hour.

35:09.318 --> 35:11.017
I don't think
I can wait that long.

35:11.019 --> 35:14.387
Promise me you'll come over
this time.

35:14.389 --> 35:16.056
I love you.

35:16.058 --> 35:18.058
Promise.

35:20.627 --> 35:22.561
Believe it.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.340
That is one hot
little piece of ass.

35:34.342 --> 35:37.042
You shut up about her.
You hear me?

35:40.013 --> 35:43.649
That's not how you
talk to me.

35:50.556 --> 35:52.423
Thanks.

35:53.459 --> 35:56.060
You, too, willy.

35:56.595 --> 35:58.496
You're welcome.

36:02.468 --> 36:05.436
You'll make a terrific
virgin mary.

36:05.438 --> 36:06.304
Shut up.

36:06.306 --> 36:08.439
Who said I was a virgin?

36:08.441 --> 36:10.575
I was talking about the play.

36:10.577 --> 36:14.444
And being a virgin is bad
because... why?

36:14.446 --> 36:16.480
'Cause nobody else is.

36:16.482 --> 36:19.283
There may be one or two.

36:19.417 --> 36:22.085
And what play are you
talking about?

36:22.087 --> 36:24.922
Hello? The Christmas play.

36:24.924 --> 36:27.624
Mary, baby Jesus,
wise men.

36:27.626 --> 36:28.926
You auditioned for it.

36:28.928 --> 36:31.094
Remember?

36:31.229 --> 36:33.630
No one does that kind
of play anymore.

36:33.632 --> 36:36.999
It's not politically correct.

36:37.001 --> 36:39.135
Oh.

36:42.572 --> 36:46.175
I ran across this
when I was cleaning.

36:49.112 --> 36:50.112
Wait.

36:50.114 --> 36:52.949
Sharon was in the band
with my mom and dad?

36:52.951 --> 36:56.319
Evidently. She was pregnant
and depressed.

36:56.321 --> 36:58.521
Her boyfriend left her.

36:58.523 --> 37:00.556
She didn't want the baby.

37:00.558 --> 37:03.091
The plan was for your mother
to watch after both kids

37:03.093 --> 37:05.193
while Sharon filled in
with the band.

37:05.195 --> 37:06.328
How do you know all this?

37:06.330 --> 37:07.729
Your father asked me
to look over things

37:07.731 --> 37:12.033
so I wouldn't throw out
anything important.

37:12.301 --> 37:14.536
This seemed important.

37:14.538 --> 37:17.272
And... kinda personal.

37:17.274 --> 37:19.140
So I stopped reading.

37:19.142 --> 37:20.542
Thanks.

37:21.243 --> 37:24.245
Would you be willing
to do me a favor?

37:24.247 --> 37:25.613
That depends.

37:25.615 --> 37:27.281
There's a bunch of kids
down at the shelter

37:27.283 --> 37:31.618
who don't know it's not politically
correct to have a christmas play.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.454
They'd really
like to have one,

37:33.456 --> 37:35.990
and I could really
use a good acting coach.

37:35.992 --> 37:39.326
I can't act.

37:40.161 --> 37:41.996
Huh.

37:44.666 --> 37:45.265
I...

37:45.267 --> 37:48.569
What makes you
think that's mine?

37:48.571 --> 37:50.270
You see?

37:50.739 --> 37:54.107
You can give
quite a performance.

37:54.109 --> 37:57.076
So, I have no choice.

37:57.078 --> 37:57.744
No.

37:57.746 --> 37:59.412
But I think you'll like it.

37:59.414 --> 38:03.716
It's 3 days a week,
and a half day saturdays.

38:09.424 --> 38:12.492
Come back to bed
and hold me.

38:17.031 --> 38:19.331
You could at least
help me with the bed.

38:19.333 --> 38:21.299
You helped mess it up.

38:53.298 --> 38:55.266
Don't be mad, Angel.

38:55.268 --> 38:57.668
Do you still
love me, Jason?

38:58.604 --> 39:02.506
You're the only girl I dated
since the 7th grade.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.176
You never say it.

39:05.178 --> 39:06.444
Uh...

39:07.345 --> 39:08.278
You've been my lady

39:08.280 --> 39:09.712
since I first saw you
at the halloween party

39:09.714 --> 39:13.216
rolling around on the floor
in that stupid pumpkin costume.

39:20.391 --> 39:22.725
I'm pregnant.

39:24.361 --> 39:26.196
You're kidding, right?

39:26.198 --> 39:27.263
No.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.666
I did the test.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.335
Three times.

39:35.505 --> 39:37.406
What are you going to do?

39:37.408 --> 39:40.209
We could get married in kentucky
on account of I'm pregnant.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.177
Kentucky?
Are you out of your gourd?

39:42.179 --> 39:43.846
We can't keep it.

39:43.848 --> 39:46.281
What do you mean?

39:47.317 --> 39:49.184
Give me a break.

39:49.186 --> 39:50.652
What do you want me to do?

39:50.654 --> 39:52.754
What we always talked about.

39:52.756 --> 39:55.591
You should've
been more careful.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.593
"Careful" works both ways.

39:57.595 --> 39:59.427
What... what
about all your talk

39:59.429 --> 40:00.595
about us being together
forever?

40:00.597 --> 40:02.563
I didn't mean
like this week!

40:02.565 --> 40:04.599
And besides,
we have no money.

40:04.601 --> 40:07.235
You can make good money
as a Carpenter.

40:07.237 --> 40:08.603
You're great at it.

40:08.605 --> 40:10.838
Angel, baby...

40:11.273 --> 40:14.142
This... just isn't a good time

40:14.144 --> 40:14.909
to get married.

40:14.911 --> 40:17.879
You can see that,
can't you?

40:25.620 --> 40:26.419
All right,

40:26.421 --> 40:28.755
I'll get the money
for the abortion.

40:28.757 --> 40:32.592
Geez, all anybody ever
wants out of me is money.

40:32.594 --> 40:34.528
That is not true!

40:34.530 --> 40:36.897
I love you, Jason.

40:38.267 --> 40:41.801
This is our child.
How can you even think of destroying it?

40:41.803 --> 40:42.869
Well, you better
think of it.

40:42.871 --> 40:45.605
'Cause I'm not
gonna be trapped by you

40:45.607 --> 40:46.406
or anyone else.

40:46.408 --> 40:49.642
Don't say a word about this
to anyone.

40:50.510 --> 40:52.344
Jason!

41:04.357 --> 41:07.660
Now, not everybody
will have a speaking part.

41:07.662 --> 41:11.263
But everyone will
have a very important role.

41:11.265 --> 41:13.432
You all have special talents.

41:13.434 --> 41:16.434
Kevin doesn't.
He's lame.

41:16.436 --> 41:18.903
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

41:19.505 --> 41:22.340
Kids, I'd like you all
to meet ms. Lane.

41:22.342 --> 41:25.210
Hi, Ms. Lane.

41:25.945 --> 41:28.446
Are you Lois Lane,
Superman's wife?

41:28.448 --> 41:31.649
No, duck-Brain.
Superman's wife is old.

41:31.651 --> 41:33.851
All right. Kids,
I'll be right back.

41:33.853 --> 41:36.854
Everyone just
behave yourselves.

41:36.989 --> 41:41.325
You're not scared of a few
second graders?

41:41.327 --> 41:42.993
No.

41:43.328 --> 41:45.929
It's the sixth graders
that I'm worried about.

41:45.931 --> 41:48.332
Look, if you're
having second thoughts,

41:48.334 --> 41:49.800
this is the time to decide.

41:49.802 --> 41:52.236
Uh... you're the one
who asked me to do this.

41:52.238 --> 41:54.371
And I think you'll
be great at it.

41:54.373 --> 41:55.272
But that doesn't mean

41:55.274 --> 41:57.941
you can quit if you go down
and change your mind later.

41:57.943 --> 41:59.776
Give me your word.

42:05.949 --> 42:08.818
Yeah. You have my word.

42:08.820 --> 42:09.685
Good.

42:09.687 --> 42:10.620
The second chapter of Luke

42:10.622 --> 42:13.022
is the theme for the script
we're gonna need.

42:13.024 --> 42:16.459
Wait, you want me
to help write the script?

42:16.461 --> 42:17.293
No.

42:17.295 --> 42:19.562
I want you to write it.

42:19.796 --> 42:23.432
Oh, and by the way,
we need 17 speaking parts.

42:23.434 --> 42:25.268
17?

42:25.270 --> 42:27.870
Everyone that wants
to work on scenery,

42:27.872 --> 42:30.740
come this way.

42:33.410 --> 42:35.710
Go, Jason!
Whoo!

42:35.712 --> 42:37.312
Oh, no.

42:53.029 --> 42:55.597
Oh, buddy.

43:20.021 --> 43:22.455
I warned you about that
superstar stuff, Lane!

43:22.457 --> 43:25.024
But coach, if hank had just been
there for me when I reached back,

43:25.026 --> 43:27.060
- none of this would've happened.
- Bullshit!

43:27.062 --> 43:28.528
You started too soon.

43:28.530 --> 43:31.931
And when hank was closing in
on you, you sped up,

43:31.933 --> 43:32.699
crossed Lanes,

43:32.701 --> 43:34.467
disqualified the whole team.

43:34.469 --> 43:38.071
This sport isn't all about you.

43:38.073 --> 43:39.105
Get it.

43:39.107 --> 43:40.807
I can change, coach.

43:40.809 --> 43:41.774
I can.

43:41.776 --> 43:43.943
Show me.

45:07.424 --> 45:09.124
That was too close for me.

45:09.126 --> 45:12.494
I don't know why you
made such a big deal out of it.

45:12.496 --> 45:15.097
Just sunglasses.

45:15.099 --> 45:17.132
We were stealing.

45:17.134 --> 45:19.802
That's not okay.

45:22.440 --> 45:26.208
There's gotta be a better way
to enjoy life.

45:27.544 --> 45:28.976
Oh, there is.

45:28.978 --> 45:31.078
He's comin' right this way.

45:31.080 --> 45:34.015
Hi, I'm ken.

45:34.017 --> 45:35.983
And you are?

45:35.985 --> 45:37.185
Barbie.

45:37.187 --> 45:38.719
I'm Barbie.

45:38.721 --> 45:40.721
You like to dance?

45:40.856 --> 45:44.091
Only if you buy me
a pink house.

45:44.226 --> 45:47.495
Some friends
are having a party later.

45:47.497 --> 45:48.996
Wanna come?

45:52.768 --> 45:55.168
Cheers, darling.

46:01.476 --> 46:03.844
Tell Nicole I had to leave.

46:03.846 --> 46:07.747
Nicole? I thought her name
was barbie.

46:07.749 --> 46:09.549
Hey, Jay.

46:09.684 --> 46:12.619
You just gonna walk in
and not speak?

46:13.154 --> 46:14.821
Hey.

46:15.990 --> 46:17.724
How was the meet?

46:17.726 --> 46:18.958
You were supposed to come.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.993
I know baby, but...

46:20.995 --> 46:22.628
The protest got started late.

46:22.630 --> 46:24.563
Somebody forgot
to bring their permit.

46:24.565 --> 46:26.165
You know...
spare me, mom.

46:26.167 --> 46:26.866
I'm sorry.

46:26.868 --> 46:28.934
I'm gonna go hang out
with some of the guys.

46:28.936 --> 46:30.669
I'm already running late.
So...

46:30.671 --> 46:32.538
Oh, by the way.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.006
I, uh... I need some money.

46:34.008 --> 46:36.976
I just gave you some.
What happened to the money that I gave you?

46:36.978 --> 46:40.713
You know I'm a growing boy.
I gotta eat, right?

46:40.715 --> 46:41.213
Uh, well,

46:41.215 --> 46:44.049
You are eatin' me
out of house and home.

46:44.051 --> 46:45.950
Here's a 20.

46:46.151 --> 46:47.685
Where's your jacket at?

46:47.687 --> 46:49.153
It's cold outside.

46:49.155 --> 46:49.888
Uh, I, uh...

46:49.890 --> 46:53.024
Left it in my locker
earlier.

46:53.026 --> 46:55.527
Can I get a hug?

46:59.064 --> 47:00.532
Mmm.

47:03.936 --> 47:06.104
Be careful, Jay.

47:08.841 --> 47:10.040
Um, Sharon?

47:10.042 --> 47:11.975
Yes?
Have you seen Mac?

47:11.977 --> 47:15.078
We're supposed to work
on a project together.

47:15.080 --> 47:16.914
No, I haven't.

47:16.916 --> 47:18.549
But you're home early.

47:18.551 --> 47:21.218
You look good.
I'm impressed.

47:21.220 --> 47:22.019
Thanks.

47:22.021 --> 47:25.622
Your father and I are gonna go
to a go green benefit tonight.

47:25.624 --> 47:27.691
You'll be okay by yourself?

47:27.693 --> 47:30.827
Yeah. Have a good time.

47:30.829 --> 47:33.096
I like those shoes.

47:35.899 --> 47:37.166
Hmm.

47:59.623 --> 48:00.221
Wow.

48:00.223 --> 48:01.890
Look at this place.

48:01.892 --> 48:03.925
How's the play coming?

48:03.927 --> 48:06.995
Do you own a dress coat?

48:06.997 --> 48:07.996
Yes.

48:07.998 --> 48:10.332
Why do you ask?

48:10.334 --> 48:11.232
I couldn't find Luke.

48:11.234 --> 48:14.669
There's a table of contents
in the front of the book.

48:14.671 --> 48:18.740
Or you could just
google it.

48:33.788 --> 48:35.389
Don't you look handsome?

48:35.391 --> 48:36.156
So do you, honey.

48:36.158 --> 48:38.092
I love that dress.
Thank you.

48:38.861 --> 48:42.229
Can you believe that Ashley
and I had a conversation today?

48:42.231 --> 48:44.031
You did?
Oh, yeah.

48:44.033 --> 48:44.865
About what?

48:44.867 --> 48:45.933
Well, she's working on, uh,

48:45.935 --> 48:49.303
some new project,
and I encouraged her.

48:49.305 --> 48:51.904
Oh, baby.
Mm-Hmm.

48:51.906 --> 48:53.640
Thank you.
Ooh ooh.

48:53.642 --> 48:56.142
Uh... watch out, now.

48:57.178 --> 48:59.812
Actually I should
be thanking you.

48:59.814 --> 49:00.413
For what?

49:00.415 --> 49:01.948
Well, for the garden,

49:01.950 --> 49:04.350
the bushes, the new flowers.

49:04.352 --> 49:05.018
Mm-Hmm.

49:05.020 --> 49:09.288
I can actually park the car
in the garage again.

49:09.290 --> 49:10.156
Who knew?

49:10.158 --> 49:12.892
You're the best.
Mwah.

49:12.894 --> 49:13.726
Mm-Hmm.

49:13.728 --> 49:14.994
Oh, do you have a 20?

49:14.996 --> 49:16.962
Here you go.

49:19.265 --> 49:21.066
Bill, you only have a 20.

49:21.068 --> 49:23.268
Nah, I've got a 20
and a 50.

49:23.270 --> 49:24.036
Mmm, no. Look.

49:24.038 --> 49:25.971
Only a 20.
Don't worry about it.

49:25.973 --> 49:27.906
I-I'll go to the bank
tomorrow, okay?

49:27.908 --> 49:29.341
Grab an arm.
Fo' sho'.

49:29.343 --> 49:32.711
Here we go.

49:44.756 --> 49:47.191
I just need some stuff.

49:47.193 --> 49:48.959
And?

49:48.961 --> 49:50.227
I, uh...

49:50.229 --> 49:52.797
I brought...
I brought money.

50:05.077 --> 50:07.410
What's wrong?

50:08.713 --> 50:10.080
Huh?

50:11.082 --> 50:13.750
Wait! Please, please,
I'm sick.

50:23.395 --> 50:27.397
Please, please,
please, guys.

50:31.936 --> 50:32.401
Please.

50:32.403 --> 50:35.437
I'll do whatever you want!

50:35.439 --> 50:37.272
I'm begging you, Geo.

50:37.274 --> 50:38.273
Please.

50:38.275 --> 50:38.941
Please!

50:38.943 --> 50:42.111
Then you're
working with roach.

50:43.480 --> 50:44.446
Ashley, you okay?

50:44.448 --> 50:46.315
Where'd you
go the other night?

50:46.317 --> 50:47.883
I gotta write a play.

50:47.885 --> 50:50.819
Did you just say,
"write a play"?

50:50.821 --> 50:51.520
I gotta go.

50:51.522 --> 50:55.023
It's just not as much fun
without you.

50:55.025 --> 50:56.859
Then go home for a change.

50:56.861 --> 50:59.160
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

50:59.495 --> 51:01.963
Okay.

52:10.564 --> 52:13.565
I've never
read that before.

52:13.567 --> 52:14.833
That's good.

52:14.835 --> 52:17.368
You'll write
with a fresh perspective.

52:18.338 --> 52:19.904
I still don't know

52:19.906 --> 52:23.141
How I'm gonna
get 17 parts out of it.

52:23.542 --> 52:26.110
Put yourself
in their positions.

52:26.112 --> 52:28.079
What would you think?

52:29.515 --> 52:32.450
Yeah, but 17 parts?

52:32.585 --> 52:34.886
When was the last time
you saw a bunch of people

52:34.888 --> 52:37.355
get together and <i>not</i>
have a lot to say?

52:37.357 --> 52:40.457
All the time at my house.

52:43.094 --> 52:44.494
Bring it back.

52:45.129 --> 52:46.864
Come here.

52:47.532 --> 52:48.866
Good boy.

52:48.868 --> 52:51.301
Good boy.

52:56.341 --> 52:58.375
Nick. What happened?

52:59.143 --> 53:01.578
Did Ken do this?

53:02.280 --> 53:04.380
I just went home

53:04.382 --> 53:06.282
Like you said.

53:07.317 --> 53:09.185
My old man
was drunk again.

53:09.187 --> 53:11.487
I should've known better.

53:14.057 --> 53:16.525
It's not your fault.

53:18.161 --> 53:20.062
You're safe now.

53:20.064 --> 53:23.199
Let's get you
to a hospital.

53:23.201 --> 53:25.067
No.

53:26.136 --> 53:28.371
Don't be afraid.

53:29.072 --> 53:31.139
Let me help you.

53:33.609 --> 53:37.178
I'll... get a first aid kit.

53:40.283 --> 53:42.484
Let's get you inside.

53:44.053 --> 53:46.187
Trust me.

53:57.999 --> 54:00.067
Okay, all right.

54:10.646 --> 54:12.446
All right.

54:35.369 --> 54:37.737
Why does he hate me?

54:37.739 --> 54:39.706
He hates himself.

54:40.674 --> 54:43.009
Why does he do this to me?

54:43.011 --> 54:45.544
He doesn't know love.

54:45.546 --> 54:47.145
That makes him dangerous.

54:47.147 --> 54:48.714
No shit.

54:48.716 --> 54:51.316
He's a monster.

54:53.152 --> 54:55.487
How do I make him stop?

54:55.489 --> 54:56.655
You can't.

54:56.657 --> 54:59.257
So I just let him
keep beating me?

54:59.259 --> 55:02.294
I definitely
don't recommend that.

55:02.296 --> 55:04.196
Then what?

55:04.198 --> 55:06.098
Do you want things
to change?

55:06.100 --> 55:08.734
That's an insane question.

55:09.068 --> 55:11.369
Then you need to report this
to the police.

55:11.371 --> 55:13.104
What he did was criminal.

55:13.106 --> 55:14.372
He'll kill me.

55:14.374 --> 55:17.108
Look, I know you're scared.

55:17.242 --> 55:19.210
It's a difficult decision.

55:19.212 --> 55:20.611
I understand.

55:20.613 --> 55:24.148
But it's one
you've got to make.

55:25.117 --> 55:27.451
He won't stop.

55:30.155 --> 55:32.556
Ever consider leaving home?

55:32.558 --> 55:35.526
Only every day.

55:35.528 --> 55:36.326
I'm 17.

55:36.328 --> 55:37.794
I don't got a place to go.

55:37.796 --> 55:41.765
I don't want to end up
sleeping on the streets.

55:43.200 --> 55:45.769
You can stay with me.

55:47.538 --> 55:50.740
It's the first place
he'd look.

55:53.544 --> 55:56.212
This is the number
for a friend of mine.

55:56.214 --> 55:59.582
Her father had a lot
in common with yours.

55:59.584 --> 56:01.617
She can give you
a place to stay.

56:01.619 --> 56:04.620
Right now, if you want it.

56:11.428 --> 56:13.562
Yeah, okay.

56:13.564 --> 56:14.730
Okay.

56:14.732 --> 56:15.764
Good.

56:15.766 --> 56:20.469
And if you're up for riding a bike,
I'll take you there tonight.

56:21.071 --> 56:22.838
Sorry.

56:22.840 --> 56:26.141
It's gonna burn a little.

56:29.144 --> 56:30.812
Thank god you're home.

56:30.814 --> 56:34.148
Where else would I be?

56:36.152 --> 56:37.785
It's me, Nick.

56:37.787 --> 56:38.853
Where are you?

56:38.855 --> 56:43.491
I've left tons
of messages and texts.

56:43.493 --> 56:45.393
Call me.

56:46.328 --> 56:49.097
Why won't you just tell me
where you took Nicki?

56:49.099 --> 56:51.699
I promise I won't
tell anybody.

56:51.701 --> 56:54.101
I gave her my word.

56:54.103 --> 56:54.634
She's okay.

56:54.636 --> 56:57.437
She'll be in touch
when she's ready.

56:57.439 --> 57:00.774
Okay, guys.
Um, there are 17 parts

57:00.776 --> 57:02.275
And we need some singers.

57:02.277 --> 57:04.478
So, who can sing?

57:10.184 --> 57:11.818
Oh, Mr. Blackman?

57:11.820 --> 57:14.454
I'm working on a play
down at the shelter,

57:14.456 --> 57:16.790
and we need to find costumes
and props...

57:16.792 --> 57:20.860
Young lady, our department
is grossly underfunded

57:20.862 --> 57:21.827
And understaffed.

57:21.829 --> 57:23.462
We need those things
ourselves.

57:23.464 --> 57:26.198
I wasn't asking for things.

57:26.200 --> 57:27.199
Just advice.

57:27.201 --> 57:30.569
Well, I'm sorry
I can't help you.

57:31.204 --> 57:32.571
Mr. Evans,

57:32.573 --> 57:33.772
You've been told before

57:33.774 --> 57:36.675
we cannot have that
horrible smell in here.

57:36.677 --> 57:38.177
They're sanding
down in the shop.

57:38.179 --> 57:41.480
And if you don't want your backdrop
covered in sawdust, I can't do it there.

57:41.482 --> 57:43.748
Yeah, well, you can't
do it here, either.

57:43.750 --> 57:45.750
There's nowhere else.

57:45.752 --> 57:47.852
Maybe you'd rather I quit.

57:47.854 --> 57:48.520
Fine,

57:48.522 --> 57:51.189
As long as you
return the paint and supplies

57:51.191 --> 57:55.193
you were advanced
for your personal use.

57:55.195 --> 57:56.361
Good-Bye.

58:01.333 --> 58:02.901
Do I know you?

58:02.903 --> 58:04.736
You look familiar.

58:04.738 --> 58:05.837
You don't.

58:05.839 --> 58:07.572
Are you always
this friendly?

58:07.574 --> 58:09.373
Only when I've
just been fired.

58:09.375 --> 58:11.308
Oh, let me give you a hand.

58:11.310 --> 58:12.409
I'm Ashley.

58:12.411 --> 58:14.211
Jonathan.

58:16.581 --> 58:19.349
Oh.

58:26.658 --> 58:28.492
Thanks.

58:38.569 --> 58:41.938
I know it's a mess,
but can I give you a lift?

58:41.940 --> 58:43.406
Are you kidding?

58:43.408 --> 58:45.441
It's a real car!

58:45.443 --> 58:46.342
Is it yours?

58:46.344 --> 58:47.543
Actually, it's a van.

58:47.545 --> 58:49.412
It's not completely
paid for yet,

58:49.414 --> 58:51.547
but it's more or less mine.

58:56.553 --> 58:59.588
I'll get that for you.
Oh.

59:00.323 --> 59:01.690
Thank you.

59:15.004 --> 59:16.771
You're, um...

59:16.773 --> 59:18.540
Different.

59:18.542 --> 59:22.277
I'll... take that
as a compliment.

59:23.246 --> 59:26.880
So, you do, like, what?

59:26.882 --> 59:28.315
Stage painting?

59:28.317 --> 59:29.717
Um, well, you know,

59:29.719 --> 59:31.485
blackman needed
some cheap labor,

59:31.487 --> 59:34.989
and I needed some supplies
and a space to work.

59:35.323 --> 59:38.525
Course, now I
don't have either.

59:38.927 --> 59:40.928
I have an idea.

59:41.363 --> 59:43.330
I'll alert the media.

59:47.535 --> 59:48.502
Your line.

59:48.504 --> 59:49.036
Hey.
Hey.

59:49.038 --> 59:52.472
Uh, guys, do you mind helping me
out a little bit? Yeah, yeah.

59:52.474 --> 59:53.873
Thank you.

59:53.875 --> 59:55.975
Uh, Mac,

59:55.977 --> 59:56.809
This is Jonathan.

59:56.811 --> 59:59.979
Jonathan, this is the guy that
I was telling you about. Hey.

59:59.981 --> 01:00:01.414
Don't tell me.

01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:03.583
Ashley offered you
a place to work

01:00:03.585 --> 01:00:07.754
if you do a simple
backdrop for our play.

01:00:08.489 --> 01:00:09.656
Yeah.

01:00:09.658 --> 01:00:12.592
Uh, so are you
in charge here?

01:00:12.594 --> 01:00:13.960
Allegedly.

01:00:13.962 --> 01:00:14.993
I'm just a volunteer.

01:00:14.995 --> 01:00:17.062
Uh, what do you need?

01:00:17.397 --> 01:00:19.498
An area that's off-Limits

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.400
Would be <i>really</i> helpful.

01:00:21.402 --> 01:00:22.801
Yeah. This way.

01:00:22.803 --> 01:00:23.835
Okay, good job, everybody.

01:00:23.837 --> 01:00:26.571
I'll be right back.
Memorize your lines.

01:00:26.573 --> 01:00:29.541
Ms. Lane, Kevin took my script
to the bathroom

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:33.045
and flushed it,
but it wouldn't go down.

01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:35.580
We'll see about that.

01:00:36.382 --> 01:00:36.815
Jonathan?

01:00:36.817 --> 01:00:39.518
Would you mind going
to the little boys' room

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.522
and retrieving Darlene's
script back, please?

01:00:52.464 --> 01:00:53.531
Hey, um,

01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:55.399
M-Maybe after we're
finished today,

01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:56.734
I could give you
a ride home?

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:59.537
Unless you have,
like, other plans

01:00:59.539 --> 01:01:00.705
or something.

01:01:00.707 --> 01:01:01.639
No!

01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:03.708
I mean, yes.

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:05.775
I never have plans.

01:01:05.777 --> 01:01:08.578
I-I mean I don't
have plans today.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.681
I... that is...
plans to rehearse,

01:01:11.916 --> 01:01:14.050
but nothing after that.

01:01:15.554 --> 01:01:16.953
I'd love a ride.

01:01:16.955 --> 01:01:19.122
Okay.

01:01:23.694 --> 01:01:24.894
Has Jason left already?

01:01:24.896 --> 01:01:27.063
I couldn't wake him.
He's still upstairs.

01:01:27.065 --> 01:01:29.065
Don't talk with your
mouth full.

01:01:29.067 --> 01:01:30.500
Have you seen my
diamond earrings?

01:01:30.502 --> 01:01:33.469
You didn't borrow them
or anything, did you?

01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:35.137
No, I haven't.

01:01:35.939 --> 01:01:38.741
You've been looking nice
recently.

01:01:38.743 --> 01:01:39.908
Well, I have been...

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:42.678
I've been talking
to this guy, and...

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.779
Ahh.

01:01:43.781 --> 01:01:46.849
Yeah, he's...
oh, just a sec.

01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:47.750
Hello?

01:01:47.752 --> 01:01:49.651
Are you serious?

01:01:49.653 --> 01:01:50.085
What?!

01:01:50.087 --> 01:01:51.820
I needed those boards,
like, yesterday.

01:01:51.822 --> 01:01:55.958
How else are we gonna motivate
these people to go green?

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.426
Yes! Motivation, okay?

01:01:58.428 --> 01:01:59.894
What a concept.

01:02:01.698 --> 01:02:03.698
Where have you been, girl?

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.933
You haven't answered
any of my calls.

01:02:05.935 --> 01:02:06.768
I've been worried.

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:10.538
I'm not living at home
anymore, so I just...

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.806
left my phone there.

01:02:11.808 --> 01:02:13.007
Where are you staying?

01:02:13.009 --> 01:02:14.075
Are you all right?

01:02:14.077 --> 01:02:15.676
You look fabulous.

01:02:15.678 --> 01:02:16.878
Thanks.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.846
You do, too. Uh...

01:02:19.081 --> 01:02:21.082
Do you wanna
do something tonight?

01:02:21.084 --> 01:02:24.518
I have to figure out how
to costume 17 kids

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.585
with no money.

01:02:25.587 --> 01:02:26.820
Wanna help?

01:02:26.822 --> 01:02:29.022
No, I don't think so.

01:02:29.024 --> 01:02:29.923
Really gotten carried away

01:02:29.925 --> 01:02:31.892
with this whole
volunteering thing, huh?

01:02:31.894 --> 01:02:33.727
Yeah, the kids love doing it.

01:02:33.729 --> 01:02:34.728
It'll be fun.

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:37.497
Besides, we need to talk.

01:02:37.499 --> 01:02:38.899
Not really.

01:02:38.901 --> 01:02:41.768
Just... at least not yet.

01:02:42.036 --> 01:02:45.005
See you around, though.

01:02:46.207 --> 01:02:47.640
Okay.

01:02:50.544 --> 01:02:53.913
I've... really missed you.

01:02:57.217 --> 01:02:59.218
Yeah, me too.

01:03:05.792 --> 01:03:08.461
Hit the showers, men.

01:03:08.463 --> 01:03:09.862
Hank.

01:03:09.864 --> 01:03:10.796
Yeah, coach?

01:03:10.798 --> 01:03:12.897
What's up with Lane?
Where is he?

01:03:12.899 --> 01:03:15.467
I... you'll have to ask him,
coach.

01:03:15.469 --> 01:03:17.802
I'm asking you.

01:03:20.907 --> 01:03:23.708
Hi, princess.

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:24.809
Hey.

01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:26.077
What's up?

01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:27.779
So, you know that junk

01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:30.949
That Mac has been
cleaning out of the garage?

01:03:30.951 --> 01:03:32.650
Can I have it?

01:03:32.652 --> 01:03:34.252
Why do you want it?

01:03:34.254 --> 01:03:35.086
To sell.

01:03:35.088 --> 01:03:35.954
You know that Mack and I

01:03:35.956 --> 01:03:37.955
Have been working on this
christmas play.

01:03:37.957 --> 01:03:39.523
Mac is too old for you.

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:42.793
Dad. Give me some credit.

01:03:42.795 --> 01:03:43.260
Ew.

01:03:43.262 --> 01:03:44.561
Okay.

01:03:44.563 --> 01:03:48.265
Ah, whatever you can make
off the stuff in the garage

01:03:48.267 --> 01:03:50.200
is yours to keep.

01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:55.572
Something else?

01:03:56.174 --> 01:03:56.874
Well, I...

01:03:56.876 --> 01:04:00.644
found this poster of your band
in the garage.

01:04:00.646 --> 01:04:02.679
You guys used to rock.

01:04:02.681 --> 01:04:03.279
You were hot.

01:04:03.281 --> 01:04:05.781
Ashley.

01:04:05.783 --> 01:04:08.851
How would you like to perform again?
I wouldn't.

01:04:08.853 --> 01:04:09.652
Dad, please?

01:04:09.654 --> 01:04:12.288
Our play would be so huge
with music.

01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:15.157
It's just so...
<i>almost</i> now.

01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:18.528
This production
needs to be big.

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:20.129
You want me to sing?

01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:22.765
And play keyboard.

01:04:27.604 --> 01:04:29.271
Hmm.

01:04:30.206 --> 01:04:34.042
Well, Sharon and I
used to do duets.

01:04:35.645 --> 01:04:36.912
That's the deal.

01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:39.314
Me and your mom,

01:04:39.316 --> 01:04:41.116
'Kay?

01:04:41.851 --> 01:04:43.652
Wow.

01:04:43.654 --> 01:04:46.821
Well, I...
I guess that could work.

01:04:46.823 --> 01:04:48.823
Okay, well, I gotta go.

01:04:48.825 --> 01:04:51.192
I have a date.

01:04:51.894 --> 01:04:53.861
I'd like to meet him.

01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:55.996
This date.

01:04:55.998 --> 01:04:57.765
So I, uh,

01:04:57.767 --> 01:04:59.733
Used to sneak
into people's back yards

01:04:59.735 --> 01:05:02.836
and steal charcoal
from the barbeques.

01:05:02.838 --> 01:05:07.074
So I could draw my murals
on buildings and sidewalks.

01:05:07.742 --> 01:05:09.743
I was just a kid.

01:05:09.745 --> 01:05:10.144
Wow.

01:05:10.146 --> 01:05:13.747
Your neighbors
must've loved you.

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:16.317
We were never
around long enough

01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:20.053
for anyone to notice
one way or the other.

01:05:31.298 --> 01:05:32.599
But you didn't quit.

01:05:32.601 --> 01:05:35.802
There was one person
who said I had potential.

01:05:35.804 --> 01:05:37.270
It was the cop
that caught me.

01:05:37.272 --> 01:05:41.341
Made me whitewash the entire side
of the building I'd just finished.

01:05:41.343 --> 01:05:42.275
That sucks.

01:05:42.277 --> 01:05:48.013
Turns out the owner had rented it out
to a Billboard company for big bucks.

01:05:48.181 --> 01:05:49.681
That cop got me my first job.

01:05:49.683 --> 01:05:52.851
Priming building sides
for advertising.

01:05:52.853 --> 01:05:55.187
I've had way worse
jobs, though.

01:05:55.189 --> 01:05:56.188
A way to make money.

01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:59.024
What made you keep at it?

01:06:00.327 --> 01:06:03.629
Would've been pretty hard
to stop me.

01:06:04.697 --> 01:06:05.897
Until recently,

01:06:05.899 --> 01:06:08.867
I only lived
and breathed painting.

01:06:21.013 --> 01:06:21.846
Hey.

01:06:21.848 --> 01:06:23.648
Jason's not here.

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:26.851
It's nice to see you, too.

01:06:26.853 --> 01:06:28.686
Can I come in?

01:06:28.688 --> 01:06:30.388
Yeah, sure.

01:06:32.691 --> 01:06:37.127
I need to have 17 costumes
made for my christmas play.

01:06:37.129 --> 01:06:39.229
How much are you paying?

01:06:39.231 --> 01:06:41.965
Well, actually... nothing.

01:06:41.967 --> 01:06:43.867
But it's for a good cause.

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:44.668
Well, please?

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:46.136
We're practically family.

01:06:46.138 --> 01:06:48.004
I barely know you.

01:06:48.006 --> 01:06:51.274
And your mother won't even
stay in the same room with me.

01:06:51.276 --> 01:06:53.143
Eh... <i>step-Mother,</i>
and consider yourself lucky.

01:06:53.145 --> 01:06:55.745
5 minutes with her
and you're late for the door.

01:06:55.747 --> 01:06:58.148
Whatever. I still need
to earn some cash now.

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:01.383
Um, we're having a garage
sale next week.

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:04.720
Whatever we make,
over our expenses,

01:07:04.722 --> 01:07:05.454
is yours.

01:07:05.456 --> 01:07:07.256
Please say you'll help.

01:07:07.258 --> 01:07:08.390
I'm desperate.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:09.992
Okay, I'll tell you what.

01:07:09.994 --> 01:07:11.694
If you'll help me
with these alterations,

01:07:11.696 --> 01:07:14.863
That'll give me some time
to help you make costumes.

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:15.998
I can't sew.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.232
I'll teach you.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.434
Otherwise, no deal.

01:07:18.436 --> 01:07:20.869
But I don't have time
for anything else.

01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:21.937
Welcome to my world.

01:07:21.939 --> 01:07:27.275
Well, if you really think
old "brainless" can help.

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:32.747
Wow.

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.319
What do you think?

01:07:39.154 --> 01:07:40.288
It's great.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.823
So you wanna try it?

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:44.025
Um, sure.

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:45.993
I don't...

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.095
Know what I'm doing.

01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:49.297
Just try it.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:51.198
Okay. Stick it in.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:51.998
Mm-Hmm.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.266
Does it matter what this...

01:07:53.268 --> 01:07:54.234
Mm-Mmm.
Is this...

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:57.170
We're worried
about the longer one.

01:07:57.172 --> 01:07:58.939
<i>lift me up <i></i></i>

01:07:58.941 --> 01:07:59.339
Oop.

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:00.507
Yeah, just...
I don't know.

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:01.842
Okay.
I don't know.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:04.978
You almost had it. Look...
<i>from the shallows <i></i></i>

01:08:05.446 --> 01:08:09.116
<i>I am stumblin' a...<i></i></i>

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:12.152
<i>lonely grave <i></i></i>

01:08:13.287 --> 01:08:16.354
<i>lift me up <i></i></i>

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:20.859
<i>from your shallows <i></i></i>

01:08:21.428 --> 01:08:24.964
<i>I am destined to...<i></i></i>

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:28.768
<i>live ashamed <i></i></i>

01:08:30.337 --> 01:08:31.403
Got more clothes.

01:08:31.404 --> 01:08:32.537
Got some clothes for ya.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.506
Oh. Okay, wait.

01:08:33.508 --> 01:08:35.374
Wait. Before you
put them down.

01:08:35.376 --> 01:08:37.143
Right there.

01:08:37.444 --> 01:08:39.044
Yeah. Just dump 'em.

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.453
It's a little big.

01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:05.370
<i>oh, I been sold out <i></i></i>

01:09:06.372 --> 01:09:09.339
<i>by my best friend <i></i></i>

01:09:10.207 --> 01:09:13.343
<i>I've been knocked down <i></i></i>

01:09:13.345 --> 01:09:16.313
<i>and thrown away <i></i></i>

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:21.417
<i>oh oh I've been sold out <i></i></i>

01:09:22.252 --> 01:09:25.189
<i>and mistreated <i></i></i>

01:09:25.456 --> 01:09:29.059
<i>I've ignited <i></i></i>

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.595
<i>a dying flame <i></i></i>

01:09:31.596 --> 01:09:33.863
That looks good.

01:09:33.865 --> 01:09:35.865
Ready?
Okay.

01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:39.569
You're my mannequin.

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:42.470
Okay. Fits really well...

01:09:42.473 --> 01:09:44.407
Obviously
for a smaller person...

01:09:44.408 --> 01:09:46.475
Have a good day.
You, too.

01:09:46.477 --> 01:09:48.211
Peace out.

01:09:48.212 --> 01:09:49.312
Okay.

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:50.212
You know what?

01:09:51.182 --> 01:09:54.116
Have a good day.
Thank you very much.

01:09:54.118 --> 01:09:56.452
Let it go for 7 bucks.

01:09:56.454 --> 01:09:58.253
What do you say?

01:09:59.522 --> 01:10:01.022
Nicki!

01:10:01.024 --> 01:10:01.590
Hey.

01:10:01.592 --> 01:10:03.391
You changed your mind.

01:10:03.393 --> 01:10:05.493
Uh, we could really
use your help.

01:10:05.495 --> 01:10:06.928
Yeah.

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:11.266
I'm just here to see what's
been keeping you so busy.

01:10:12.134 --> 01:10:14.970
Or should I say "who"?

01:10:15.504 --> 01:10:17.939
I'm so over
spending time at bars,

01:10:17.941 --> 01:10:19.341
And I'm glad you are, too.

01:10:19.343 --> 01:10:20.308
This is much more fun.

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:21.877
Yeah, spare me the pep talk.

01:10:21.879 --> 01:10:23.444
I know you.

01:10:26.348 --> 01:10:28.449
Peace offering.

01:10:36.359 --> 01:10:37.524
That's vodka.

01:10:37.526 --> 01:10:40.361
Yeah, I know. It's your fave.
I don't do that anymore.

01:10:40.363 --> 01:10:44.131
Look, neither you or my dad have
ever gone too long without a drink.

01:10:44.133 --> 01:10:47.334
I never knew that you
thought I was like your dad.

01:10:47.336 --> 01:10:50.503
I'm sorry.
I don't.

01:10:50.905 --> 01:10:53.006
Look, it's been a bad week.

01:10:53.008 --> 01:10:53.673
W-What's going on?

01:10:53.675 --> 01:10:56.075
You've obviously
been too busy to care.

01:10:56.077 --> 01:10:57.543
I care.
You're my best friend!

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:00.380
But Nicki, I'm finally
doing something that I like.

01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:01.981
Do it with me.

01:11:01.983 --> 01:11:03.516
I don't belong here.

01:11:03.518 --> 01:11:04.617
I don't belong anywhere.

01:11:04.619 --> 01:11:07.120
That's not true.
I... I want you to meet someone.

01:11:07.122 --> 01:11:10.323
You never used to argue
with me before.

01:11:10.325 --> 01:11:12.125
Look, go back
to your friends.

01:11:12.127 --> 01:11:13.126
Like your biker buddy said,

01:11:13.128 --> 01:11:15.627
I got a lot of heavy decisions
to make right now.

01:11:15.629 --> 01:11:17.529
I'll see you later.

01:11:25.305 --> 01:11:28.607
You've met Ashley's
friend before?

01:11:28.609 --> 01:11:30.108
Maybe.

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:33.545
Look, it was over
3 years ago.

01:11:33.547 --> 01:11:35.380
Ashley know about that?

01:11:35.382 --> 01:11:38.684
It's nobody else's
business but mine.

01:11:38.686 --> 01:11:39.550
Bill!

01:11:39.552 --> 01:11:41.686
Can I have a word
with you?

01:11:41.688 --> 01:11:43.187
All right.

01:11:54.633 --> 01:11:55.733
All right.

01:11:55.735 --> 01:11:57.068
You okay. Come on.

01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:59.103
It's okay.

01:12:06.177 --> 01:12:08.345
It's all right.

01:12:08.347 --> 01:12:09.245
She'll be all right.

01:12:09.247 --> 01:12:11.281
She just shouldn't lift
anything with her condition.

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:15.151
Jason will never speak to me
if he thinks I've told anyone.

01:12:15.153 --> 01:12:19.122
This isn't the sort of thing
you can hide for very long.

01:12:19.124 --> 01:12:19.756
What, you're...

01:12:19.758 --> 01:12:22.125
You're having Jason's baby?

01:12:22.127 --> 01:12:22.759
What's you plans?

01:12:22.761 --> 01:12:26.062
I'll go to school
until christmas break,

01:12:26.064 --> 01:12:27.497
and then...

01:12:27.499 --> 01:12:28.565
I don't know.

01:12:28.567 --> 01:12:33.402
It's not the most complete
set of plans I've ever heard.

01:12:33.404 --> 01:12:34.737
It needs work.

01:12:34.739 --> 01:12:35.771
What does Jason
propose to do?

01:12:35.773 --> 01:12:40.009
- I don't know.
- Okay, I know Jason can be a real...

01:12:40.011 --> 01:12:41.110
weiner at times,

01:12:41.112 --> 01:12:44.079
but deep down,
he really does care.

01:12:44.347 --> 01:12:47.549
I don't think he
wants either of us.

01:12:47.551 --> 01:12:49.151
He's changed so much.

01:12:49.153 --> 01:12:52.254
Hey, could I get some help
over here?

01:12:54.758 --> 01:12:57.291
How long are those people
gonna be in our yard?

01:12:57.293 --> 01:12:59.093
Looks like a garage sale.

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:04.232
Oh, Sharon.
Baby, it is a garage sale.

01:13:04.234 --> 01:13:06.334
Well it makes us look poor.

01:13:06.336 --> 01:13:08.236
What is this all about?

01:13:08.238 --> 01:13:09.737
Seeing you selling off

01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:11.706
All of Amanda's old things.

01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:13.608
It's just...
I...

01:13:13.809 --> 01:13:17.512
I didn't think you'd
mind if we sold them.

01:13:18.714 --> 01:13:22.115
Oh, baby.

01:13:23.351 --> 01:13:25.385
So nice to see you
and Ashley getting along

01:13:25.387 --> 01:13:28.121
Since she's
been doing the play.

01:13:28.123 --> 01:13:32.292
You must be very proud that she's
doing something creative, huh?

01:13:32.294 --> 01:13:33.060
I am.

01:13:33.062 --> 01:13:35.729
She's certainly
home a lot more.

01:13:35.731 --> 01:13:36.496
Mm-Hmm.

01:13:36.498 --> 01:13:39.466
I just wish Jason were.

01:13:39.801 --> 01:13:40.634
And I wish I knew

01:13:40.636 --> 01:13:43.136
Why our things
keep disappearing.

01:13:43.138 --> 01:13:45.638
My jewelry,
money from our wallets.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.107
And now my mother's silver.

01:13:48.109 --> 01:13:49.308
Yeah.

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:50.843
Oh, baby.

01:13:53.713 --> 01:13:57.483
Has it ever occurred to you
that it might be Jason?

01:13:57.485 --> 01:14:01.454
He's lost a lot of weight.
He does not look good.

01:14:02.722 --> 01:14:03.589
Bill, I'm tired.

01:14:03.591 --> 01:14:06.092
Could you just get rid
of those people soon?

01:14:06.094 --> 01:14:08.461
You betcha.
Thanks.

01:14:11.564 --> 01:14:12.764
Hey, Mac.
Hey.

01:14:12.766 --> 01:14:13.765
Let's wrap this up, huh?

01:14:13.767 --> 01:14:16.568
You got it.
Been a long day, huh?

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:17.268
Yes, sir.

01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:20.538
We did really well...
so, we have a few more things to sell.

01:14:22.309 --> 01:14:23.508
Show some mercy!

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:24.409
I'm beat.

01:14:24.411 --> 01:14:26.144
We've made 247

01:14:26.146 --> 01:14:26.711
And 63 cents.

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.714
That means we have enough
to buy the rest of the supplies

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:31.749
and pay me something.

01:14:32.318 --> 01:14:33.551
Maybe a little left over

01:14:33.553 --> 01:14:36.420
for some paint and canvas?

01:14:36.422 --> 01:14:38.455
You're just in it
for the paint.

01:14:38.457 --> 01:14:39.456
Yeah...
and just for that,

01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:43.193
I am not letting you
take me to pizza tonight.

01:14:43.195 --> 01:14:46.763
Um, actually,
can I take a rain check?

01:14:46.765 --> 01:14:49.666
Something sorta came up.

01:14:49.668 --> 01:14:51.435
What?

01:14:51.603 --> 01:14:53.904
Just some personal stuff.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.172
Okay.

01:14:55.174 --> 01:14:57.307
Don't let me interfere, then.

01:14:57.309 --> 01:14:58.742
Don't be that way.

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:00.144
Here, just take the keys

01:15:00.146 --> 01:15:01.511
And get all the rest
of this... to shelter,

01:15:01.513 --> 01:15:05.214
And I'll come by
and pick it up later, okay?

01:15:08.285 --> 01:15:09.886
See you later.

01:15:09.888 --> 01:15:11.354
Bye.

01:15:13.524 --> 01:15:14.357
You know what?

01:15:14.359 --> 01:15:16.292
Let's just do the shelter thing
another day.

01:15:16.294 --> 01:15:18.194
You take the truck,
get some rest,

01:15:18.196 --> 01:15:20.363
go home, and...
I'll call you later.

01:15:20.365 --> 01:15:23.566
Uh... Ashley! Tell me you
are not going to follow him.

01:15:23.568 --> 01:15:26.636
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.347
I heard coach let you go.

01:15:39.349 --> 01:15:40.782
Sorry, buddy.

01:15:40.784 --> 01:15:43.652
Yeah, well you
could've covered for me.

01:15:43.654 --> 01:15:44.920
I've been sick.

01:15:44.922 --> 01:15:45.921
I tried to cover.

01:15:45.923 --> 01:15:46.888
He didn't buy it.

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:49.925
Everybody knows you
got a problem.

01:15:52.228 --> 01:15:54.195
Hey. You're my friend!

01:15:54.197 --> 01:15:56.297
But you're whacked out, man.

01:15:56.299 --> 01:15:57.631
You need help.

01:15:57.633 --> 01:15:59.667
Screw you.

01:16:09.244 --> 01:16:10.244
Hey.

01:16:10.246 --> 01:16:12.213
Hi.

01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:13.514
Nice shirt.

01:16:13.516 --> 01:16:16.850
Had these made for everyone
in the play.

01:16:17.419 --> 01:16:18.351
Long time, no see.

01:16:18.353 --> 01:16:20.286
I didn't think you'd
even remember me.

01:16:20.288 --> 01:16:23.223
I mean, it's been
over 3 years.

01:16:23.225 --> 01:16:24.924
And that was a pretty
wild night.

01:16:24.926 --> 01:16:27.860
And now you're
dating my best friend.

01:16:28.863 --> 01:16:30.396
Small world.

01:16:30.398 --> 01:16:32.232
Yeah. Thing is,

01:16:32.234 --> 01:16:34.934
I didn't even know you two
knew each other.

01:16:34.936 --> 01:16:37.470
Is that a problem for you?

01:16:37.605 --> 01:16:40.873
Well, I mean, Ashley's just
been so busy with the play,

01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:44.876
and she's just beginning
to have confidence in herself,

01:16:44.878 --> 01:16:47.012
And...
and you?

01:16:47.014 --> 01:16:48.313
And me?

01:16:48.315 --> 01:16:49.481
And, well...

01:16:49.483 --> 01:16:51.583
That subject just
hasn't come up yet.

01:16:51.585 --> 01:16:54.653
You know me.
I'm not gonna say anything.

01:16:54.655 --> 01:16:55.354
But...

01:16:55.356 --> 01:16:58.624
She's bound to find out
sooner or later.

01:16:58.626 --> 01:17:00.659
Later would be better.

01:17:00.661 --> 01:17:03.495
I'd just rather
tell her myself.

01:17:03.497 --> 01:17:05.831
So this a real thing?

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:11.636
Looks like you've been taking
pretty good care of yourself.

01:17:11.638 --> 01:17:13.671
Had to.

01:17:13.673 --> 01:17:15.373
Yeah.

01:17:15.874 --> 01:17:18.542
You had to do it alone.

01:17:19.311 --> 01:17:23.447
I just couldn't handle
any relationships at the time.

01:17:23.449 --> 01:17:26.284
But... I'm here for you now.

01:17:26.952 --> 01:17:31.355
Don't make any promises
you can't keep.

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:36.626
This is where I'm staying.

01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:40.964
Nobody knows but Mac.

01:17:40.966 --> 01:17:43.566
You're pretty great, Nicole.

01:17:45.703 --> 01:17:46.670
What's the matter, Nick?

01:17:46.672 --> 01:17:49.472
Ken and the bar boys
not enough action for you?

01:17:49.474 --> 01:17:50.874
You have
to steal my boyfriend?

01:17:50.876 --> 01:17:52.809
This is too funny.

01:17:52.811 --> 01:17:54.978
I know what this
must look like,

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:56.346
but it's...

01:17:57.949 --> 01:17:59.682
I'm laughing.

01:17:59.684 --> 01:18:00.849
Wha...

01:18:01.752 --> 01:18:03.018
Have a little faith in me.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.322
I do. Very little.

01:18:06.523 --> 01:18:08.757
Wanna reconsider
that promise?

01:18:08.759 --> 01:18:11.493
<i>if I knew now <i></i></i>

01:18:11.495 --> 01:18:14.330
<i>what I knew then <i></i></i>

01:18:14.332 --> 01:18:18.634
<i>if I hadn't forgotten <i></i></i>

01:18:18.636 --> 01:18:20.469
<i>what we meant <i></i></i>

01:18:20.471 --> 01:18:23.572
<i>if I held on <i></i></i>

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:26.641
<i>though the hard times <i></i></i>

01:18:26.643 --> 01:18:30.345
<i>if I'd done what I needed <i></i></i>

01:18:30.347 --> 01:18:33.014
<i>to make things right <i></i></i>

01:18:33.016 --> 01:18:35.650
<i>I'd know love <i></i></i>

01:18:35.652 --> 01:18:38.086
<i>before I lost it <i></i></i>

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:40.988
<i>if I hadn't forgotten <i></i></i>

01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:43.825
What are you
doing in my room?

01:18:43.827 --> 01:18:46.627
"Sharon's had it so tough.

01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:51.498
I'm going to take care
of Jason until she's ready."

01:18:55.036 --> 01:19:00.073
Your mother never really
loved the band like I did.

01:19:02.477 --> 01:19:05.379
But she loved me and Bill.

01:19:05.513 --> 01:19:09.116
We thought we were
doing what she wanted.

01:19:09.118 --> 01:19:11.785
What are you talking about?

01:19:15.021 --> 01:19:17.790
You're a lot like her.

01:19:18.525 --> 01:19:21.961
You're both so pretty.

01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:24.797
Are you okay?

01:19:25.031 --> 01:19:28.634
I watched you
sell Amanda's things.

01:19:28.769 --> 01:19:31.670
Have you been stealing my things
and selling them, too?

01:19:31.672 --> 01:19:34.039
Honestly, Sharon,
I haven't.

01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:36.409
No... why would I?

01:19:39.147 --> 01:19:41.413
I don't know how
to be a good mother.

01:19:41.415 --> 01:19:43.114
You're starting
to freak me out.

01:19:43.116 --> 01:19:47.519
Why doesn't my son like me?

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.754
I'm gonna go get daddy.

01:19:49.756 --> 01:19:51.856
I've pushed Bill away.

01:19:52.725 --> 01:19:55.593
Is he gonna leave me, too?

01:19:56.929 --> 01:19:59.697
Why don't you just...

01:19:59.699 --> 01:20:01.433
give me the diary?

01:20:01.435 --> 01:20:02.434
No!

01:20:02.436 --> 01:20:03.635
No, no.

01:20:03.637 --> 01:20:05.536
Sharon!

01:20:06.771 --> 01:20:09.506
What is going on?

01:20:12.877 --> 01:20:15.512
Hey, sorry to come by
so late.

01:20:15.514 --> 01:20:16.647
Your mom's not home, right?

01:20:16.649 --> 01:20:18.949
No, night shift again.
What's wrong?

01:20:18.951 --> 01:20:20.717
Everything.
Just take this...

01:20:20.719 --> 01:20:22.486
Most of it's yours, anyway.

01:20:22.488 --> 01:20:24.655
Okay, well, come in.

01:20:27.792 --> 01:20:29.693
Well, where's Jonathan?

01:20:29.695 --> 01:20:31.861
With my ex-Best friend.

01:20:31.863 --> 01:20:34.997
And Sharon's freaking out
about something.

01:20:34.999 --> 01:20:36.833
I don't know.

01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:39.469
Will you help me
with this?

01:20:39.471 --> 01:20:40.970
Yeah.

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:45.908
Men are pond scum.

01:20:46.643 --> 01:20:48.611
But... what are you gonna do?

01:20:48.613 --> 01:20:51.981
Honestly, I have no idea.

01:20:51.983 --> 01:20:53.649
But I've talked to god
about it,

01:20:53.651 --> 01:20:56.685
And I know that
he's forgiven me,

01:20:56.687 --> 01:20:57.719
which is definitely

01:20:57.721 --> 01:21:01.089
more than I can
say for my mom at the moment.

01:21:01.557 --> 01:21:03.692
So you talk to god directly?

01:21:03.694 --> 01:21:05.494
Of course. Don't you?

01:21:05.496 --> 01:21:07.996
Oh, yeah, all the time.

01:21:09.633 --> 01:21:13.068
All I know is Jason
needs to get off the drugs.

01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:15.103
Himself.

01:21:15.105 --> 01:21:17.672
He has to decide.

01:21:17.674 --> 01:21:18.807
Have you decided

01:21:18.809 --> 01:21:21.742
If you're gonna
keep the baby, or...

01:21:21.744 --> 01:21:22.943
go to school?

01:21:22.945 --> 01:21:23.511
Both.

01:21:23.513 --> 01:21:27.681
You can't be anything
if you haven't finished school.

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:30.150
W-What are you gonna
do when the baby comes?

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:32.720
Well my mom
won't kick me out,

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:33.654
and since she works nights,

01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:36.023
she'll be able to watch
the baby during the day.

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:39.293
I'm gonna try to work
for a store doing alterations

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:40.628
so I can be with her at night.

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:42.196
I see you've
decided it's a girl.

01:21:42.198 --> 01:21:44.231
Have you named her yet?

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.033
Shut up.

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:49.869
I'm popular tonight.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.607
You must be the Angel.

01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:55.742
I'm a friend of Jazz.

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:59.212
I know who you are,
and you're not welcome here.

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:01.581
Who are you?!
Leave her alone!

01:22:08.088 --> 01:22:10.557
Angelina's mom
has already called the cops.

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:13.158
Your brother's an idiot.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.726
I'm not.

01:22:14.728 --> 01:22:15.761
Whore's mom works nights.

01:22:15.763 --> 01:22:18.830
That's when he gets
his free piece of ass.

01:22:18.832 --> 01:22:20.198
Ain't that right?

01:22:29.976 --> 01:22:31.076
Jazz...

01:22:31.078 --> 01:22:33.745
Is a very disappointing boy.

01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:39.317
But... you already knew that,
didn't you?

01:22:39.918 --> 01:22:41.953
Jason's too good for you.

01:22:51.663 --> 01:22:53.798
Let her go, Geo.

01:22:54.601 --> 01:22:56.834
Everybody's here.

01:22:56.836 --> 01:22:57.735
Nice.

01:22:57.737 --> 01:22:59.337
I said, "let her go"!

01:23:14.285 --> 01:23:16.252
The money, Jazz!

01:23:16.787 --> 01:23:18.788
I don't have it.

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:20.323
Search him.

01:23:25.196 --> 01:23:27.297
I don't have it!

01:23:31.267 --> 01:23:33.068
What?!

01:23:39.042 --> 01:23:40.743
Nothin'.

01:23:40.745 --> 01:23:43.312
Then this is our
lucky night.

01:23:54.023 --> 01:23:55.323
Bitch!

01:24:09.838 --> 01:24:12.206
We're gonna try this again.

01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:14.942
This time
I want a better answer.

01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:17.845
The money is where?

01:24:20.315 --> 01:24:22.015
It's outside.

01:24:22.684 --> 01:24:24.718
Under the doormat.

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:31.224
I-I brought it...

01:24:31.226 --> 01:24:32.959
For the baby.

01:24:35.129 --> 01:24:35.796
Money.

01:24:35.798 --> 01:24:38.165
You give that back!

01:24:41.803 --> 01:24:43.103
Money.

01:24:50.077 --> 01:24:55.181
Easy.

01:24:55.183 --> 01:24:56.949
You're okay.

01:25:03.857 --> 01:25:04.857
Just chill.

01:25:32.184 --> 01:25:33.985
Ah!

01:25:37.355 --> 01:25:39.423
The lord is my shepherd.

01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:41.158
I shall not want.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.962
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:46.864
Oh...

01:25:46.866 --> 01:25:50.167
He leadeth me
beside still waters.

01:25:50.169 --> 01:25:50.968
He restores my soul.

01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:52.903
- Shut up with that religious shit.
- Yea, though I walk

01:25:52.905 --> 01:25:55.572
- Though the valley of the shadow of death...
- Get the money.

01:25:55.772 --> 01:25:58.509
- I will fear no evil, for you are...
- Where's the money?

01:25:59.912 --> 01:26:00.843
No.

01:26:01.346 --> 01:26:03.880
Thy rod and thy staff,

01:26:03.882 --> 01:26:06.315
they comfort me.

01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:08.818
O lord, please!

01:26:14.459 --> 01:26:17.026
Though the valley
of the shadow of death.

01:26:17.028 --> 01:26:20.196
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:26:20.198 --> 01:26:23.166
You prepareth a table
in the presence of my enemies.

01:26:23.168 --> 01:26:23.833
Stop!

01:26:23.835 --> 01:26:25.867
He anointeth my head
with oil.

01:26:25.869 --> 01:26:28.036
Get Geo.
Let's get out of here.

01:26:28.038 --> 01:26:28.870
Surely goodness and...

01:26:28.872 --> 01:26:32.007
And mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life.

01:26:32.009 --> 01:26:33.308
Take it easy.

01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:34.976
You don't
wanna hurt anybody.

01:26:44.954 --> 01:26:47.122
That everything?

01:26:48.157 --> 01:26:49.558
Pretty much.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.358
Okay.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.827
Then, um,

01:26:52.829 --> 01:26:54.028
we're done with you
for now.

01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:57.531
In the morning, I'll need you
to come down, and, uh,

01:26:57.533 --> 01:26:59.300
identify the accused.

01:26:59.302 --> 01:26:59.967
Officer,

01:26:59.969 --> 01:27:02.336
do you think we could
have our costume money back?

01:27:02.338 --> 01:27:04.004
The play is only
a few days away.

01:27:04.006 --> 01:27:06.207
Mmm, right now,
it's still evidence

01:27:06.209 --> 01:27:08.108
Confiscated at the scene
of the crime.

01:27:08.110 --> 01:27:10.144
I have to have that money.

01:27:10.146 --> 01:27:11.612
Those kids are counting on me.

01:27:11.614 --> 01:27:12.479
I-I gave them my word.

01:27:12.481 --> 01:27:16.616
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

01:27:20.221 --> 01:27:23.156
So what made you
come tonight?

01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:24.290
I needed to see you.

01:27:24.292 --> 01:27:28.328
But when you weren't home,
I figured you were at Angelina's.

01:27:28.330 --> 01:27:30.964
After your date with Nicole?

01:27:30.966 --> 01:27:31.865
It wasn't a date.

01:27:31.867 --> 01:27:35.501
I mean, I wish you would
just listen to me so I could...

01:27:39.608 --> 01:27:40.306
Let me go!

01:27:40.308 --> 01:27:43.542
Give him the sedative now.
Let me go! Let me go!

01:27:43.544 --> 01:27:46.311
<i>Let me go!</i>

01:27:47.213 --> 01:27:49.147
Is Jason gonna
be all right?

01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:51.583
The gunshot wounds
were superficial.

01:27:51.585 --> 01:27:52.885
He had so many drugs
in his system

01:27:52.887 --> 01:27:56.321
that he's actually doing better
now with the transfusions

01:27:56.323 --> 01:27:57.389
we've given him.

01:27:57.391 --> 01:27:58.423
Can you help him?

01:27:58.425 --> 01:28:00.058
I mean, with the addiction?

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.561
We can monitor and assist
with withdrawal now.

01:28:02.563 --> 01:28:05.497
But ultimately,
whether he stays clean,

01:28:05.499 --> 01:28:07.198
- it's up to him.
- Right.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.066
How soon can he come home?

01:28:09.068 --> 01:28:10.167
He could go to jail.

01:28:10.169 --> 01:28:11.469
But I am recommending

01:28:11.471 --> 01:28:14.472
that he sign himself
into a rehab center.

01:28:14.474 --> 01:28:15.606
Oh, thank you so much.

01:28:15.608 --> 01:28:17.208
No, Jason... Jason...
oh.

01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:18.442
Is not going to jail.

01:28:18.444 --> 01:28:19.677
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

01:28:19.679 --> 01:28:22.213
That's <i>our</i> son
lying back there.

01:28:22.215 --> 01:28:26.684
And that's <i>our</i> daughter
that almost got shot.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:28.986
God!

01:28:28.988 --> 01:28:31.355
Oh, my god.
Oh, baby.

01:28:31.357 --> 01:28:34.257
Oh, god.

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:37.327
Sharon.

01:28:39.997 --> 01:28:43.533
I haven't always
done what's right in the past.

01:28:43.535 --> 01:28:45.335
I know that. But...

01:28:45.337 --> 01:28:45.969
Bill!

01:28:45.971 --> 01:28:48.672
Our whole world
is falling apart.

01:28:48.674 --> 01:28:49.439
Let me finish.

01:28:49.441 --> 01:28:52.642
What I want
to tell you, baby...

01:28:57.349 --> 01:28:59.415
Nothing in our lives

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:01.550
Has worked out
the way we wanted.

01:29:01.552 --> 01:29:04.553
But believe it or not,
baby, I love you,

01:29:04.555 --> 01:29:06.722
and I want our family
to work.

01:29:06.724 --> 01:29:10.426
It's up to us
to work things out.

01:29:11.194 --> 01:29:13.295
Look at me.

01:29:19.002 --> 01:29:21.503
Oh, oh, come here.

01:29:21.505 --> 01:29:22.638
Come here, baby.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.506
My girl.

01:29:25.508 --> 01:29:27.508
Who's my girl?

01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:28.142
I am.

01:29:28.144 --> 01:29:32.213
I really enjoyed practicing
with you the other day.

01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:34.415
Me too.

01:29:34.417 --> 01:29:37.018
More than you know.

01:29:41.657 --> 01:29:43.057
I love you.

01:29:43.059 --> 01:29:44.459
I love you, too.

01:29:45.762 --> 01:29:47.095
I'm caught.

01:29:47.097 --> 01:29:48.228
I'm caught.
Stand still.

01:29:48.230 --> 01:29:50.097
Stand still.
You're making it worse.

01:29:50.099 --> 01:29:51.231
Stand still.
Get it loose, Bill!

01:29:51.233 --> 01:29:53.133
Baby, you're gonna make it...
get it loose!

01:29:53.135 --> 01:29:56.269
Why'd you come
get me anyway, huh?

01:29:56.271 --> 01:30:01.108
Friends don't let friends
drive drunk.

01:30:05.646 --> 01:30:09.116
You can be a real
pain in the butt sometimes.

01:30:09.118 --> 01:30:11.485
But I love you, girl.

01:30:11.487 --> 01:30:14.487
I love you...
okay, Sharon...

01:30:14.489 --> 01:30:17.223
Oh, oh, it's caught!

01:30:17.225 --> 01:30:17.723
Wait, Sharon...

01:30:17.725 --> 01:30:20.526
Amanda, look out!

01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:24.096
Calm down.

01:30:24.098 --> 01:30:25.398
I'm here.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:26.632
Oh, baby.

01:30:26.634 --> 01:30:28.167
What is the matter?

01:30:30.670 --> 01:30:32.338
What is the matter?

01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:35.508
I was just
trying to hug her.

01:30:36.644 --> 01:30:39.244
All my fault.

01:30:40.479 --> 01:30:43.715
It was all my fault.
No.

01:30:49.055 --> 01:30:51.356
It was an accident.

01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:54.359
I forgive you.

01:30:54.361 --> 01:30:58.496
You've got
to forgive yourself.

01:30:59.198 --> 01:31:00.131
Okay?

01:31:00.133 --> 01:31:02.434
I can't.

01:31:02.436 --> 01:31:04.401
I loved her so much.

01:31:04.403 --> 01:31:05.736
Oh, baby.

01:31:05.738 --> 01:31:08.238
We both did.

01:31:08.807 --> 01:31:11.775
But that was another life.

01:31:12.677 --> 01:31:16.080
You're not leaving? Now?

01:31:16.082 --> 01:31:17.714
What about me?

01:31:18.716 --> 01:31:20.584
You're off to a good start.

01:31:20.586 --> 01:31:22.152
I lost the money
for the play,

01:31:22.154 --> 01:31:25.089
my best friend and my boyfriend
are cheating on me,

01:31:25.091 --> 01:31:27.291
and Angelina and Jason
are in the hospital.

01:31:27.293 --> 01:31:30.326
And now you're leaving.

01:31:38.836 --> 01:31:40.736
See you at the shelter.

01:31:40.738 --> 01:31:42.505
Won't be the same.

01:31:42.507 --> 01:31:43.306
Nothing ever is.

01:31:43.308 --> 01:31:47.310
But you've got 17 kids
counting on you.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.813
I'm gonna go
see Angelina right now.

01:31:50.815 --> 01:31:53.850
I'll catch up
with you later.

01:31:53.852 --> 01:31:55.117
Mac?

01:31:55.119 --> 01:31:57.586
Will you check on Jason
for me?

01:31:57.588 --> 01:32:00.555
Um, make sure
that he's okay?

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:01.523
If he needs anything.

01:32:01.525 --> 01:32:03.625
I'll do better than that.

01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:28.649
You think visiting hours
apply to chairs?

01:32:28.651 --> 01:32:29.783
Where'd you get that?

01:32:29.785 --> 01:32:33.220
From your friends
down at the shop.

01:32:34.422 --> 01:32:35.489
It's a piece of trash.

01:32:35.491 --> 01:32:38.559
No. Like you,
it's a real piece of work.

01:32:38.561 --> 01:32:41.495
And, like you,
it's just not finished yet.

01:32:41.497 --> 01:32:46.332
Although, it looks considerably
better than you at the moment.

01:32:46.467 --> 01:32:48.768
You think they'll
let me work on it?

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.336
At the rehab center?

01:32:50.338 --> 01:32:51.237
Sure. They're...

01:32:51.239 --> 01:32:54.674
Bound to need better chairs
down there.

01:32:54.676 --> 01:32:55.708
So what's next?

01:32:55.710 --> 01:32:57.577
None of your business.

01:32:57.579 --> 01:32:58.945
Who are you, anyway?

01:32:58.947 --> 01:33:01.681
A friend of Angelina's.

01:33:02.349 --> 01:33:03.216
How is she?

01:33:03.218 --> 01:33:04.817
Nobody tells me anything
around here.

01:33:04.819 --> 01:33:06.753
They treat me
like a criminal.

01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:09.622
What's so funny?

01:33:09.624 --> 01:33:11.323
You <i>are</i> a criminal.

01:33:11.325 --> 01:33:12.658
I did it for Angel.

01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:15.227
So she could keep the baby.

01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:17.529
They didn't tell you?

01:33:19.766 --> 01:33:22.367
She lost the baby.

01:33:22.702 --> 01:33:25.470
She said you didn't want it.

01:33:29.776 --> 01:33:32.678
Look, uh...

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.980
Thanks for the rocker.

01:33:35.716 --> 01:33:38.983
Just, please...
just leave me alone.

01:33:38.985 --> 01:33:40.585
This is between Angel and me.

01:33:40.587 --> 01:33:42.220
We'll work it out.

01:33:42.222 --> 01:33:43.888
Maybe.

01:33:44.523 --> 01:33:45.723
Maybe not.

01:33:45.725 --> 01:33:48.593
She hasn't
regained consciousness yet.

01:33:48.595 --> 01:33:52.697
The doctors don't
expect her to make it.

01:33:56.502 --> 01:33:57.902
Please! Wait, wait, wait.

01:33:57.904 --> 01:33:58.803
Wait.

01:33:58.805 --> 01:34:00.705
Just please...

01:34:00.707 --> 01:34:01.805
Just help me.

01:34:01.807 --> 01:34:02.839
Help you do what?

01:34:02.841 --> 01:34:04.307
Just gotta see Angel.

01:34:04.309 --> 01:34:06.343
And please just
talk to somebody.

01:34:06.345 --> 01:34:07.377
If you're really her friend,

01:34:07.379 --> 01:34:08.712
You know she'll want me
to be there.

01:34:08.714 --> 01:34:11.281
She's all alone.
Just please let me see her.

01:34:11.283 --> 01:34:14.517
She doesn't
need your guilt right now.

01:34:14.519 --> 01:34:16.319
She needs your love,

01:34:16.321 --> 01:34:18.622
Your faith,

01:34:18.624 --> 01:34:20.790
And your prayers.

01:34:20.792 --> 01:34:22.325
Look...

01:34:22.327 --> 01:34:26.996
I know that I am not
worth her little finger...

01:34:27.330 --> 01:34:31.600
But she's the only person
that I really loved.

01:34:33.804 --> 01:34:36.438
She always wanted me
to say that to her,

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.940
but I never did.

01:34:37.942 --> 01:34:40.509
I'll see what I can do.

01:34:43.813 --> 01:34:48.584
You know you can make a difference
if you're willing to change.

01:34:48.586 --> 01:34:52.987
The greatest man in the universe
was a simple carpenter.

01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:55.723
And his life...

01:34:55.725 --> 01:34:58.593
Changed this pLanet.

01:35:12.508 --> 01:35:14.976
Another volunteer.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.946
Hi, I'm Nicki.

01:35:19.948 --> 01:35:21.548
Watch the sticky fingers.

01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:23.684
I got a heavy date tonight.

01:35:23.885 --> 01:35:26.787
What is this <i>sack</i>
you are wearing?

01:35:26.789 --> 01:35:28.889
I'm Mary, the virgin.

01:35:28.891 --> 01:35:30.791
And this is my costume.

01:35:30.793 --> 01:35:31.591
Well, no wonder.

01:35:31.593 --> 01:35:34.061
You're never gonna
get a guy looking like that.

01:35:34.063 --> 01:35:38.332
Hey, makeovers
are what I do.

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.567
Come on.

01:35:44.871 --> 01:35:48.407
I'd prefer you
didn't bring her here.

01:35:48.875 --> 01:35:53.646
Has anyone ever told you how
extremely irritating you can be?

01:35:54.581 --> 01:35:56.382
It wasn't a date!

01:35:56.384 --> 01:35:59.552
In two weeks, Nicole
is going to have to testify

01:35:59.554 --> 01:36:02.621
Against her own father
in court.

01:36:02.856 --> 01:36:05.725
What does that
have to do with you?

01:36:11.464 --> 01:36:13.665
My mom left us
when I was a kid.

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:14.933
My dad turned into a lush.

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:18.136
I used to go by the bars after
school to help work off his Bill.

01:36:18.138 --> 01:36:21.506
Nicole used to come by
and pick up her old man.

01:36:21.508 --> 01:36:25.643
He was usually passed out
in a corner somewhere.

01:36:25.645 --> 01:36:28.646
It was kind of
a regular routine.

01:36:29.014 --> 01:36:31.516
We never really talked much.

01:36:32.084 --> 01:36:32.951
Well,

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:36.820
One day, my old man
started a fight.

01:36:37.055 --> 01:36:39.923
I tried stopping him
and ended up getting hammered

01:36:39.925 --> 01:36:43.060
between him and Nicole's dad.

01:36:43.762 --> 01:36:44.928
Bartender called the police,

01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:47.097
and all of us
were hauled off to jail.

01:36:47.099 --> 01:36:50.100
Nicole and I
were given a choice.

01:36:50.568 --> 01:36:51.835
Could go back home,

01:36:51.837 --> 01:36:52.970
or we could press charges

01:36:52.972 --> 01:36:55.973
and have to live as a ward
of the state.

01:36:55.975 --> 01:36:58.975
Nicole was younger,
so she went back home.

01:36:58.977 --> 01:37:00.610
I left and...

01:37:00.612 --> 01:37:01.944
I never looked back

01:37:01.946 --> 01:37:03.146
When I was old enough,

01:37:03.148 --> 01:37:04.881
I left the state home,

01:37:04.883 --> 01:37:08.050
And I've been
supporting myself ever since.

01:37:08.052 --> 01:37:10.153
Her dad turned
into a mean drunk.

01:37:10.155 --> 01:37:12.555
She's been living
on his unemployment,

01:37:12.557 --> 01:37:13.689
getting meals from guys,

01:37:13.691 --> 01:37:15.591
Shoplifting, whatever.

01:37:15.593 --> 01:37:17.193
Well if it was that bad
for Nicole,

01:37:17.195 --> 01:37:19.695
then why did she
take me to bars?

01:37:19.697 --> 01:37:20.830
It's what she knows.

01:37:20.832 --> 01:37:23.866
It was way better than staying
at home with her old man.

01:37:23.868 --> 01:37:25.600
Can you help her?

01:37:25.602 --> 01:37:27.803
Be easier if...

01:37:27.805 --> 01:37:30.806
She had a few
friends around.

01:37:34.812 --> 01:37:37.012
I will be.

01:37:37.014 --> 01:37:39.214
Sorry.

01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:44.653
Look, am I gonna have to fix
all these costumes by myself?

01:37:44.655 --> 01:37:45.620
I mean, look at them.

01:37:45.622 --> 01:37:48.223
Without me, you would
have <i>no</i> fashion sense.

01:37:48.225 --> 01:37:49.723
Zip. Nada.

01:37:49.725 --> 01:37:50.991
I mean, really?

01:37:50.993 --> 01:37:52.593
Come on...
oh... okay.

01:37:52.595 --> 01:37:53.961
I get it.

01:37:54.095 --> 01:37:55.463
Do you think you could help

01:37:55.465 --> 01:37:56.831
with makeup, too?

01:37:56.833 --> 01:37:57.231
Duh.

01:37:57.233 --> 01:37:59.800
And can we get, like,
little halos or something?

01:37:59.802 --> 01:38:04.071
I mean, you can't really
be an Angel without them.

01:38:04.573 --> 01:38:05.506
Don't see why not.

01:38:05.508 --> 01:38:06.640
Just give me tin foil

01:38:06.642 --> 01:38:09.109
and <i>lots</i> of glitter.

01:38:24.158 --> 01:38:25.525
I'll be right outside.

01:38:42.843 --> 01:38:46.678
I'm so sorry, Angel.

01:38:51.652 --> 01:38:55.153
I know... I know
I screwed up big-Time.

01:38:55.155 --> 01:38:58.757
Yeah.

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.795
You never did anything

01:39:03.797 --> 01:39:05.763
In your entire life
to deserve this.

01:39:05.765 --> 01:39:09.166
I-I love you
so much, baby.

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:16.741
I'd give anything...

01:39:16.743 --> 01:39:19.577
Anything to have things
back the way they were.

01:39:19.579 --> 01:39:21.112
I would.

01:39:29.922 --> 01:39:33.123
Angel's god...

01:39:38.996 --> 01:39:43.800
I need to talk to you.

01:39:47.973 --> 01:39:48.872
She would...

01:39:48.874 --> 01:39:50.574
She would always
talk to you

01:39:50.576 --> 01:39:52.175
like you were her friend.

01:39:53.844 --> 01:39:56.612
She told me that
she prayed for me.

01:39:56.614 --> 01:39:57.012
It...

01:39:57.014 --> 01:40:01.183
It must've worked
because I'm still here, right?

01:40:04.154 --> 01:40:07.056
I never prayed for her.

01:40:07.058 --> 01:40:08.958
Never.

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.160
And i know that's wrong...

01:40:11.162 --> 01:40:14.229
On account that
she's in real trouble now,

01:40:14.231 --> 01:40:15.664
and it's all my fault.

01:40:15.666 --> 01:40:17.866
She told me that...

01:40:17.868 --> 01:40:19.735
That Jesus...

01:40:23.272 --> 01:40:26.941
Jesus went to hell for me...

01:40:28.043 --> 01:40:29.210
To pay for what i did.

01:40:29.212 --> 01:40:32.213
To pay for...

01:40:33.949 --> 01:40:36.718
To pay for what I did.

01:40:39.188 --> 01:40:43.658
He must've been
tough as shit, because...

01:40:44.893 --> 01:40:48.161
I can't handle
this hell I'm in.

01:40:49.931 --> 01:40:53.734
I understand that, uh...

01:40:53.901 --> 01:40:57.371
That you rose yourself
from the dead.

01:40:57.373 --> 01:40:58.271
I get it.

01:40:58.273 --> 01:40:59.673
I believe it. I do.

01:40:59.675 --> 01:41:00.707
I believe it.

01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:02.242
Believe it.

01:41:07.248 --> 01:41:08.181
So it's not like...

01:41:08.183 --> 01:41:13.953
It's not like it's a big deal for you
to get her out of this coma, right?

01:41:15.656 --> 01:41:17.323
Right?

01:41:30.337 --> 01:41:31.671
I know...

01:41:31.673 --> 01:41:34.206
I know that I fucked up.

01:41:36.843 --> 01:41:38.043
She told me

01:41:38.045 --> 01:41:41.179
That you forgive everybody.

01:41:42.682 --> 01:41:45.050
Even shits like me.

01:41:53.826 --> 01:41:57.696
If you can...
if you can do anything,

01:41:57.698 --> 01:41:59.798
anything with my life...

01:42:01.701 --> 01:42:03.934
you can have it.

01:42:04.335 --> 01:42:06.470
Just, please,

01:42:06.472 --> 01:42:08.906
please,

01:42:08.908 --> 01:42:11.008
don't let Angel die.

01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:13.877
Don't let her die on me.

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:22.319
She's my best friend.
I'm so sorry.

01:42:22.887 --> 01:42:24.188
I love you, baby.

01:42:24.190 --> 01:42:26.256
I love you.

01:42:53.449 --> 01:42:55.817
Thank you. All right.
That's for the animals.

01:42:55.819 --> 01:42:57.085
Slow down.
You're going too fast.

01:42:57.087 --> 01:43:00.188
Can I please have all my Angels
on the steps over here?

01:43:00.190 --> 01:43:02.023
I forgot what I'm
supposed to say.

01:43:02.025 --> 01:43:04.059
Just remember
why you need the room,

01:43:04.061 --> 01:43:06.094
and you'll
say the right thing.

01:43:06.096 --> 01:43:06.928
Hey, Nicole,

01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:09.030
where's that glittery
star you made?

01:43:09.032 --> 01:43:10.265
I mean, I've got a rig

01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:12.234
And a slot,
but no star.

01:43:12.236 --> 01:43:15.003
Shepherds, pay attention.

01:43:15.005 --> 01:43:16.438
When watching
over your flock at night,

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:19.106
do not... repeat, do not
step on the electrical cords.

01:43:19.108 --> 01:43:22.476
Okay, here we go.
And a 5, 6, 7, 8.

01:43:22.478 --> 01:43:27.414
Hey, you didn't say,
"and a 1, and a 2, and a 3."

01:43:27.416 --> 01:43:29.283
All right, I'll give you
a one and a two.

01:43:29.285 --> 01:43:32.887
Kevin, stop
picking your nose, buddy.

01:43:35.024 --> 01:43:36.423
Who's there?

01:43:36.425 --> 01:43:37.324
What do you want?

01:43:37.326 --> 01:43:41.228
Fear not.
You're extremely flavored of the lord.

01:43:41.230 --> 01:43:42.429
What's that mean?

01:43:42.431 --> 01:43:45.365
God loves you,
and he picked <i>you</i>

01:43:45.367 --> 01:43:46.933
To be the mother
of his kid.

01:43:46.935 --> 01:43:48.268
You know, the son of god.

01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:50.537
Uh-Uh! I'm a virgin.

01:43:50.539 --> 01:43:52.839
Uh-Huh.
So what do I do?

01:43:52.841 --> 01:43:56.109
Nothing. God will
take care of everything,

01:43:56.111 --> 01:43:58.845
Including talking to Joseph
about it.

01:43:58.847 --> 01:44:01.915
Okay. If you say so.

01:44:03.384 --> 01:44:04.918
Hey, Joe, wake up.

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.387
Mary's with child.
Say what?

01:44:07.389 --> 01:44:08.321
She's pregnant.

01:44:08.323 --> 01:44:10.222
I didn't <i>do</i> anything.

01:44:10.224 --> 01:44:11.323
We know, we know.

01:44:11.325 --> 01:44:12.424
She really is a virgin.

01:44:12.426 --> 01:44:14.326
What do you
want <i>meto do?</i>

01:44:14.328 --> 01:44:15.861
First, marry her.

01:44:15.863 --> 01:44:16.962
But don't touch her.

01:44:16.964 --> 01:44:20.432
Then, name the baby Jesus.

01:44:20.434 --> 01:44:21.200
Anything else?

01:44:21.202 --> 01:44:22.501
Yeah, take good care
of them.

01:44:22.503 --> 01:44:25.270
I'll be bringing
more instructions later.

01:44:25.272 --> 01:44:31.210
<i>Caesar was disgusted and
sent everyone home to be taxed.</i>

01:44:31.212 --> 01:44:32.878
My wife's having a baby.

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:34.079
- Let me it.
- <i>No!</i>

01:44:34.081 --> 01:44:37.849
You're supposed to say,
"there's no room at the inn!"

01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:39.417
<i>I said "no", didn't i?</i>

01:44:39.419 --> 01:44:40.284
What do we do?

01:44:40.286 --> 01:44:44.355
<i>You can sleep in the barn if you want.</i>
Thanks.

01:44:50.996 --> 01:44:52.897
The star stopped.

01:44:52.899 --> 01:44:55.233
Look! There's the castle
over there.

01:44:55.235 --> 01:44:59.937
Well, the lights are on.
So they must still be up.

01:45:03.541 --> 01:45:06.142
Hi, we're very wise men.

01:45:06.144 --> 01:45:08.478
<i>And</i> wise woman.
I'm horrid.

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.182
We've been following his star
for a very long time.

01:45:12.184 --> 01:45:13.650
Then you must be hungry.

01:45:13.652 --> 01:45:14.885
Come enjoy some twinkies

01:45:14.887 --> 01:45:18.588
While I check it out
with my wise guys.

01:45:22.994 --> 01:45:25.961
My boys say <i>if</i> it's true,

01:45:25.963 --> 01:45:28.530
He's supposed to be born
in bethlehem.

01:45:28.532 --> 01:45:29.899
Where's that?

01:45:29.901 --> 01:45:30.666
Not too far from here.

01:45:30.668 --> 01:45:32.534
I'll show you on my GPS.

01:45:32.536 --> 01:45:34.169
Thanks.

01:45:34.171 --> 01:45:35.271
Just a minute.

01:45:35.273 --> 01:45:37.072
You owe me now.

01:45:37.074 --> 01:45:40.009
So when you find out
where he is, you let me know.

01:45:40.011 --> 01:45:42.278
Do <i>you</i> want
to worship him, too?

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:44.013
Yeah. Me and the boys

01:45:44.015 --> 01:45:47.483
are gonna pay him
a little visit.

01:46:02.564 --> 01:46:05.066
Hey, how your sheep doing?

01:46:05.068 --> 01:46:07.068
They're okay.

01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.702
But I'm bored.

01:46:07.704 --> 01:46:10.204
Nothing <i>ever</i> happens
in bethlehem.

01:46:10.206 --> 01:46:14.442
When I'm old enough,
I'm going to Jerusalem,

01:46:14.444 --> 01:46:15.510
be a tax collector.

01:46:15.512 --> 01:46:19.146
They make <i>big</i> money.
<i>Angels we have heard on high</i>

01:46:19.148 --> 01:46:21.014
Hark! Herald Angels
are singing!

01:46:21.016 --> 01:46:25.719
<i>sweetly singing
o'er the plains</i>

01:46:25.721 --> 01:46:35.662
<i>gloria <i></i></i>

01:46:35.664 --> 01:46:39.132
<i>in excelsis</i>

01:46:39.134 --> 01:46:44.637
<i>deo <i></i></i>

01:46:44.639 --> 01:46:45.338
Fear not.

01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:47.673
Behold, I bring you
good tidings

01:46:47.675 --> 01:46:50.142
of great joy
which shall be

01:46:50.144 --> 01:46:51.344
to all people.

01:46:51.346 --> 01:46:53.245
Which means?

01:46:53.247 --> 01:46:54.313
Good news for everybody.

01:46:54.315 --> 01:46:58.317
Unto you is born,
this day, in the city of david,

01:46:58.319 --> 01:47:02.021
a savior,
which is christ the lord.

01:47:02.023 --> 01:47:03.222
This shall be a sign to you:

01:47:03.224 --> 01:47:06.692
you shall find a babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes,

01:47:06.694 --> 01:47:08.026
lying in a manger.

01:47:08.028 --> 01:47:10.362
What are swaddling clothes?

01:47:10.364 --> 01:47:12.163
Pampers, dummy.

01:47:12.165 --> 01:47:14.232
Let's check it out.

01:47:14.234 --> 01:47:16.668
What about our sheep?

01:47:16.670 --> 01:47:18.536
Bring 'em with.

01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:22.173
Glory to god in the highest.

01:47:22.175 --> 01:47:24.075
And on earth, peace.

01:47:24.077 --> 01:47:26.211
Goodwill to all men.

01:47:26.213 --> 01:47:28.146
<i>Mary, did you know <i></i></i>

01:47:28.148 --> 01:47:30.615
<i>that your baby boy <i></i></i>

01:47:30.617 --> 01:47:34.752

<i>did you know <i>
Ashley.</i></i>

01:47:46.198 --> 01:47:47.698
We, uh, took up a collection
at the station,

01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:52.703
And thought maybe you could use this
to buy some presents for the kids.

01:47:53.104 --> 01:47:57.740
<i>this child
that you delivered <i></i></i>

01:47:57.742 --> 01:48:02.111
