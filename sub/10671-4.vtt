00:14.783 --> 00:18.037
Hey, man. You okay?
You keeping a low profile?

00:18.119 --> 00:23.792
What? No, man. No, no, no. I'm just...
I'm kind of just leaning up against this.

00:23.876 --> 00:26.336
Yeah, did you see Kara?
I didn't see her in there today.

00:26.419 --> 00:30.007
No. Yeah. I...
I guess she's not here.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.884
-Hey, you going to the store?
-Yeah.

00:31.967 --> 00:35.261
Yeah? Well, hop on.
I can give you a ride.

00:36.805 --> 00:39.140
-Oh, God. You didn't.
-Oh, no, I did.

00:39.224 --> 00:41.226
And I got it for half price,
two hundred bucks.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.144
Isn't that what a normal bike costs?

00:43.228 --> 00:45.939
Yeah, but this one has...
it's for two people.

00:46.023 --> 00:48.149
Not if one of them's me.

00:50.652 --> 00:51.528
Hey!

01:26.855 --> 01:29.441
You know, I'm thinking of
getting out of it for a little while.

01:29.524 --> 01:30.776
Rejuvenate.

01:30.859 --> 01:33.570
-Out of what?
-"It," man. The daily grind.

01:35.530 --> 01:40.368
-You don't think I'm in "the grind"?
-No, I do. It's just that... no.

01:40.452 --> 01:43.329
No, I just want to get out of here
for a minute. Get some sunshine.

01:43.455 --> 01:46.416
-Dude.
-Come on. You know what I mean.

01:46.499 --> 01:49.210
Yeah, I do.
It actually sounds kind of nice.

01:49.294 --> 01:51.588
Well, then, come with me, man.
A little boondoggle.

01:51.671 --> 01:53.465
We can blast off this morning.

01:53.548 --> 01:57.218
-Yeah, I'd have to close the store.
-If a tree falls in the woods...

01:57.302 --> 01:58.595
That's fair.

01:58.678 --> 02:00.139
What? Fuck!

02:00.221 --> 02:01.890
You've got to... you've got to give me...

02:01.974 --> 02:04.225
you've got to give more of a warning
when I'm on this thing.

02:04.309 --> 02:06.394
What'd you have in mind?
Like, Catalina?

02:06.478 --> 02:09.229
Yeah, I don't know.
I was thinking the desert would be nice.

02:09.314 --> 02:12.233
-Palm Springs, maybe.
-Fuck that.

02:12.317 --> 02:14.861
Come on, man. Something's up.
She called me last night.

02:14.945 --> 02:17.447
I'm not going out there to run
interference between you and your mom.

02:17.530 --> 02:19.407
But she likes you.
It helps if you're there.

02:19.491 --> 02:22.786
I just really feel like this is something
you need to do solo, you know?

02:22.869 --> 02:25.747
Plus, if there was a real problem,
Wild Bill would have called.

02:25.872 --> 02:27.373
Yeah, I guess.

02:27.457 --> 02:29.375
And I've got to take care
of some store shit.

02:29.459 --> 02:31.336
Figure out my next move.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.213
Yeah, as in,
where you're going to move to?

02:37.217 --> 02:38.718
Shit!

02:41.429 --> 02:43.389
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:43.473 --> 02:44.891
-Hey!
-Hey.

02:51.857 --> 02:53.900
What are you two lovebirds up to?

02:53.984 --> 02:56.028
-Well...
-Nothing.

02:56.111 --> 02:59.114
She's trying to whisk me
off to Palm Springs for the night.

02:59.198 --> 03:01.908
How romantic.
Your mom lives there, right?

03:01.992 --> 03:02.826
Yeah.

03:02.909 --> 03:06.163
I told him it was too early
to meet his folks, but...

03:07.664 --> 03:09.875
I've never been to Palm Springs.

03:14.838 --> 03:19.051
-What are you up to?
-It's my day off, so... no plans.

03:20.177 --> 03:21.511
No plans.

04:07.933 --> 04:10.560
No funny voice. You have
to sing for real. That's the game.

04:10.643 --> 04:12.020
-I know, but it's so hard.
-Sing for real.

04:12.104 --> 04:14.606
Sing for real.
It's called "sing for real."

04:14.689 --> 04:16.357
-It's just, it's hard.
-Okay, Chip.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.985
No, no, no. I can't do it.
'Cause I don't sing and I don't--

04:19.069 --> 04:20.445
All right, here.
Let's hear you do it. You go.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.530

So, what's she like? Your mom.
You two get along?

05:29.722 --> 05:30.849
Um...

05:30.932 --> 05:34.602
Well, that depends on the lunar cycle
and her medication.

05:34.686 --> 05:37.147
-I like Jackie. She's cool.
-Yeah?

05:37.230 --> 05:40.942
-I had a different experience of her.
-Go on, if you want to.

05:41.026 --> 05:44.112
Uh... Yeah, no, she was...

05:44.196 --> 05:48.783
She was a very unconventional mother,
even for the '70s, wouldn't you agree?

05:48.867 --> 05:52.371
Yeah, I would say that "unconventional"
pretty much sums her up.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.789
And dad? Or no dad?

05:54.873 --> 05:59.585
No, no. The opposite, actually.
A lot of dads. Yeah. None that ever stuck.

05:59.669 --> 06:02.922
Yeah, she was a very...

06:03.006 --> 06:05.967
Wow. This sounds weird
saying this about your own mother,

06:06.051 --> 06:07.886
but she was very sexual.

06:07.969 --> 06:13.266
She was always a very sexual person.
So, yeah. A lot of men. A lot of breakups.

06:13.350 --> 06:17.145
And she'd always make me
break the news,

06:17.229 --> 06:20.148
which was hard, you know,
for a ten-year-old,

06:20.232 --> 06:22.401
but at least she was around.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.484
Oh, she was around.

06:26.363 --> 06:27.613
High school was an experience.

06:27.697 --> 06:31.617
All my friends would come over
to do blowbacks with my hot mom.

06:31.701 --> 06:33.412
-Oh, God.
-Mrs. Robinson.

06:33.494 --> 06:37.416
Yeah, that's what they called her.
Hilarious, right?

06:37.498 --> 06:40.793
-So, then you took off to Paris.
-I did. France, yeah.

06:40.877 --> 06:43.463
-Thought that'd be far enough away.
-And it wasn't.

06:43.546 --> 06:49.344
No. That's-- She sent me letters
saying that I was ungrateful and selfish

06:49.428 --> 06:52.638
and that I had betrayed
and abandoned her.

06:52.722 --> 06:55.975
Yeah, and that's when
the real vindictive shit started.

06:56.059 --> 06:58.061
I'm sorry.

06:58.144 --> 07:01.189
He was... pretty messed up
by the time he got back to Venice.

07:01.273 --> 07:04.317
Yeah. Yeah, I was a drunk.

07:04.401 --> 07:06.278
But you got through it.

07:07.904 --> 07:09.114
Mm-hmm.

07:09.197 --> 07:13.493
Well, I can't wait to meet her.

07:45.984 --> 07:48.069
They were all out.
They only had...

07:49.488 --> 07:51.197
Except for these.

08:11.634 --> 08:14.513
So, did Kara like the cake
that you got for her?

08:14.595 --> 08:15.638
Yeah.

08:16.515 --> 08:20.601
I mean, you were there when she said
she's not that into cake, right?

08:21.894 --> 08:23.896
And she's got a point.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.316
Cake's not going to keep you sober.

08:26.399 --> 08:28.485
But the first year, that's a big one.

08:29.235 --> 08:30.778
I still remember mine.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.115
When was that?

08:34.198 --> 08:38.244
I'm coming up on ten years now.
God willing.

08:38.328 --> 08:41.746
-Ten years?
-Yeah.

08:41.831 --> 08:45.502
Ten years since...

08:45.585 --> 08:46.503
Since...?

08:48.838 --> 08:51.007
Since I killed someone.

08:53.718 --> 08:56.929
I'm not proud of it, but it's the truth.

08:58.139 --> 09:02.602
I was driving and I was loaded...

09:02.685 --> 09:07.148
Not that that's an excuse.
It's not. It's just the bare facts.

09:07.232 --> 09:13.196
And I've got to keep that always
on the front burner, you know?

09:13.279 --> 09:17.867
Anything else would... be a lie.

09:17.950 --> 09:20.828
There isn't a day that goes by
that I don't...

09:20.912 --> 09:22.205
That you don't mention it?

09:24.999 --> 09:28.002
Sorry. I was just trying
to lighten the mood.

09:54.070 --> 09:55.572
I didn't say anything about the cake

09:55.655 --> 09:57.907
because I didn't want Dennis
to read into it.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.452
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah.

10:02.203 --> 10:05.790
-Hello, handsome.
-Hey, beautiful.

10:07.417 --> 10:13.298
Oh, my God! Chip! Oh, my God!
You came all this way just to see me?

10:13.381 --> 10:15.634
Hey, I came all this way, too, Mom.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.428
-Are those for me?
-Yes, they are.

10:20.096 --> 10:22.848
It's so beautiful. How thoughtful.

10:22.932 --> 10:26.311
-It was actually London's idea.
-Hi, Jackie. Nice to meet you.

10:26.394 --> 10:29.855
Nice to meet you. Oh, my God, Chip.
She's the best one yet.

10:29.939 --> 10:32.442
No, she's not... she's not his girlfriend.

10:32.525 --> 10:33.734
-No?
-No.

10:33.818 --> 10:36.112
Well, she's not yours.

10:38.156 --> 10:39.865
I thought you were here to help.

10:39.949 --> 10:42.243
Dude, I didn't...

10:45.746 --> 10:49.417
I'm glad I changed the tee time.
I would have missed you guys.

10:49.501 --> 10:51.670
Thank you.
Are you a big golfer, Bill?

10:51.752 --> 10:54.673
Are you kidding? My Bill would sleep
in the clubhouse if they let him.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.009
-That's not exactly true.
-Bill, come on. Be honest.

10:58.092 --> 11:01.680
-Yeah, Bill, he likes golf.
-I do like to play.

11:03.764 --> 11:08.687
Well, here we go.
Arnold Palmers all around.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.689
Cheers.

11:11.648 --> 11:12.482
Cheers.

11:14.984 --> 11:17.445
So, Mom, what's going on?
What's the big emergency?

11:17.529 --> 11:18.946
Oh, I'll tell you that later.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.823
That's the thing.
We have to head out soon.

11:20.906 --> 11:23.075
Why the rush? You just got here.

11:23.159 --> 11:26.663
We're all booked into the healing center.
We're going to do the whole thing.

11:26.746 --> 11:28.873
I love the healing center.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.211
-You should come with us.
-No.

11:33.294 --> 11:37.298
No. No, no, no. The last thing you need
is a fourth wheel. Right, boys?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.178
No.

11:42.261 --> 11:45.056
You would not be a fourth wheel.
You should definitely come with us.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.224
Really?

11:53.732 --> 11:54.857
This is fun.

12:15.378 --> 12:20.132
So, Chip, who is keeping
your bed warm these days?

12:20.216 --> 12:23.261
No one, really.
Just me and my cotton sheets.

12:23.344 --> 12:27.640
What about Kara? I thought you guys
just crossed the threshold into serious.

12:27.724 --> 12:29.768
I don't know if I'd put it in those terms.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.561
Oh, what terms would you put it in?

12:31.644 --> 12:36.399
I'd say that it's more like we crossed
the threshold into broken up.

12:36.482 --> 12:38.943
Yeah? When was that?

12:39.026 --> 12:43.656
-It's been a long time coming.
-Huh. I didn't know that. What happened?

12:43.740 --> 12:47.493
I don't know. I guess she said that
she felt she was better off without me.

12:47.577 --> 12:50.204
-Chip, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

12:50.329 --> 12:52.039
Yeah, well, there's more fish in the sea.

12:52.123 --> 12:56.877
Yeah, and I'm sure Chip is going
to cast his net out real soon. Right?

13:10.308 --> 13:13.603
I was going to tell you, okay?
What do you think this trip was for?

13:13.686 --> 13:17.231
I just needed a minute
to process it, that's all.

13:17.315 --> 13:21.152
Dude, I wouldn't hold anything
back from you. You're my best friend.

13:21.235 --> 13:25.490
Dennis, come on, man. I always
try to be as transparent as I can.

13:25.573 --> 13:29.910
I know. You're so transparent,
I can see right through you.

13:31.621 --> 13:33.873
How long you been sitting on that line?

13:39.170 --> 13:40.630
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:40.713 --> 13:45.468
So, what do we want to do first?
The hot springs or the body scrub?

13:45.551 --> 13:48.053
-I like the sound of the hot springs.
-Oh, great.

13:48.137 --> 13:50.807
Then you and I will be doing
the milk bath.

13:51.808 --> 13:55.728
Why don't we all just do the hot springs?
We can all just...

13:55.812 --> 13:59.899
God. Come on, grandpa.
The milk bath is going to be good for us.

13:59.982 --> 14:02.360
Cleopatra took milk baths.

14:04.236 --> 14:07.365
-Do you want to do the hot springs?
-Do you?

14:11.536 --> 14:13.579
Is there anything else I can do for you?

14:13.705 --> 14:18.250
Well, I can think of a couple of things,
but I've got my son right here.

14:18.334 --> 14:20.879
That's never stopped you before.

14:38.855 --> 14:40.314
Dennis?

14:41.774 --> 14:42.983
-Dennis.
-Mm.

14:45.862 --> 14:48.364
I've made a decision,
and I don't want you to get mad.

14:49.699 --> 14:52.076
This doesn't sound good.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.746
Bill and I are going our separate ways.

14:54.829 --> 14:57.665
I knew it.

14:57.749 --> 15:00.919
-It's not right between us.
-What, Mom? How could you say that?

15:01.001 --> 15:04.129
Huh? Bill, he loves you.
He takes care of you.

15:04.213 --> 15:06.632
-You can't survive without him.
-Oh, please.

15:06.716 --> 15:09.051
You just think I'm going
to be a burden to you.

15:09.134 --> 15:11.930
No, Mom, that's not it.
Bill, he loves you.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.306
He keeps you balanced.
Your medication and everything.

15:14.390 --> 15:16.893
I can take fucking pills.

15:18.519 --> 15:20.271
Are you high right now?

15:20.354 --> 15:23.357
Not really.

15:23.441 --> 15:24.984
I split a half of a gummy.

15:25.067 --> 15:27.027
Just... just now? With who?

15:27.111 --> 15:31.365
-London. What do you care?
-No, I don't care, Mom.

15:31.449 --> 15:33.576
How are you going to live?
Where are you going to live?

15:33.659 --> 15:35.202
How are you going to make money?
You thought about that?

15:35.286 --> 15:38.706
-I've got the house.
-You're going to move back to Venice?

15:38.790 --> 15:40.833
I can sell it.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.335
I Zillowed it on the Internet.
I can make a fortune.

15:43.419 --> 15:45.463
Okay, and where are you going to live?

15:45.546 --> 15:48.883
Where are you going to live?
That's what you mean.

15:48.967 --> 15:52.052
I am... I'm going to be fine.
I can get a place.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.851
So, what does Wild Bill say?

15:58.935 --> 16:01.980
Well, I haven't told Bill yet.
You tell him.

16:02.062 --> 16:05.024
Jesus! Fuck, Mom!
He's going to be devastated.

16:05.107 --> 16:07.026
Could you Zen it down?

16:07.109 --> 16:10.446
Look, this is bad, Mom, even for you.
How can you do this?

16:10.529 --> 16:15.493
Because he doesn't do it for me.
He doesn't know the right buttons to push.

16:15.576 --> 16:18.454
Come on, Mom. I don't even know
if you have buttons left to push.

16:18.537 --> 16:19.622
Right, Dennis. Yeah.

16:19.705 --> 16:22.875
You always had a hard time
accepting the fact that I have needs,

16:22.959 --> 16:24.293
I have desires.

16:24.376 --> 16:27.087
-I mean, even as a child--
-No, Mom, I was a child!

16:27.171 --> 16:28.756
You said you wouldn't get mad.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.180
And, just as a fact,
the buttons are still there...

16:36.263 --> 16:38.933
...and Eduardo knows how to push them.

16:39.017 --> 16:40.434
Jesus Christ!

16:40.518 --> 16:42.394
Oh, my God.
Your butt is so white.

16:42.478 --> 16:44.146
Who the fuck is Eduardo?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.736
Are you disappointed?

16:50.820 --> 16:52.989
-In what?
-Me.

16:54.198 --> 16:55.533
Should I be?

16:56.158 --> 16:58.619
I don't know.

16:58.703 --> 17:04.834
I don't know how I'd react if I found out
someone I knew killed someone.

17:06.377 --> 17:07.878
Where do you put that?

17:10.464 --> 17:12.050
I don't put it anywhere.

17:14.385 --> 17:15.553
It's like he's always...

17:17.555 --> 17:19.515
-He...
-He haunts you?

17:22.226 --> 17:27.772
You know, you do that thing where you go,
"What if I'd taken the later bus?

17:27.857 --> 17:31.443
Or if I'd left the house
a few minutes earlier?"

17:31.527 --> 17:36.281
It's like that every day,
except the stakes I'm playing with are...

17:39.451 --> 17:40.995
I took a life.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.713
Someone who had...

17:50.796 --> 17:56.886
friends and parents,
brothers and sisters...

17:56.969 --> 17:59.430
lovers.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.432
A person.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.684
Just like you and me.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.898
So, how do you wake up every day?

18:10.858 --> 18:15.988
Do things, exist, live, laugh?
How do you... how do you do anything?

18:19.033 --> 18:22.078
The only thing I can do
is just try to be a better person.

18:23.996 --> 18:25.664
And are you?

18:27.332 --> 18:28.167
It...

18:30.044 --> 18:32.088
It's made me want to help people.

18:34.339 --> 18:36.926
Help people lead better lives.

18:39.595 --> 18:42.473
And it's reminded me
that all we've got is this.

18:43.891 --> 18:44.725
And this.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.315
And this.

19:00.199 --> 19:03.119
Not that. All right. Let's...

19:03.202 --> 19:04.745
Yeah, let's get out.

19:12.003 --> 19:13.879
All right, who's up for some body work?

19:13.963 --> 19:17.216
-Will you be doing it?
-Yes, ma'am.

19:17.299 --> 19:20.427
Well, in that case,
I can't wait to have my body worked.

19:20.511 --> 19:22.513
-Mom, please.
-What?

19:22.596 --> 19:24.682
I'm still in good shape.
Don't you think, Mike?

19:24.765 --> 19:26.642
-Yes, you are.
-Man, do you mind?

19:26.725 --> 19:30.395
-Stop being so rude to my new friend.
-Knock it off, Mom. I'm not in the mood.

19:30.479 --> 19:33.273
-Maybe I am.
-Hey, no. You're not doing that.

19:33.357 --> 19:34.483
-Let go of my arm.
-Stop.

19:34.566 --> 19:36.027
-Let go. Ow!
-Watch it, son.

19:36.110 --> 19:38.946
I'm not your fucking son.
Don't call me your son.

19:39.030 --> 19:40.489
Dennis, Dennis.
Come on, man. Cool it.

19:40.572 --> 19:42.616
No, he can't-- I don't have
to put up with this shit.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.410
-All right. Come on, man.
-No, Mom, this is what you do.

19:45.494 --> 19:48.039
This is why I had to move continents,
and you ruined that, too.

19:48.122 --> 19:52.292
Why don't you just stop, okay?
Grow old. You're so fucking pathetic.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.046
Fuck!

19:55.129 --> 19:56.505
Dennis!

19:58.132 --> 19:59.800
Fuck!

20:00.551 --> 20:01.552
Fuck!

20:03.470 --> 20:05.347
-Fuck!
-Jesus, dude.

20:05.430 --> 20:09.977
Hey, man. I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for back there.

20:10.061 --> 20:14.398
-She really pushes your buttons.
-Please, don't use that term.

20:15.816 --> 20:16.817
Okay.

20:28.620 --> 20:32.499
Look, man, you've got the tools
to deal with this shit, man.

20:32.583 --> 20:35.086
All right? You... you're a good dude.

20:35.169 --> 20:38.672
You are. You've got to know that.

20:40.132 --> 20:41.759
You are...

20:41.842 --> 20:46.889
an emotionally-developed,
aware 42-year-old man

20:46.972 --> 20:50.226
who could easily pass for 35.

20:50.309 --> 20:52.019
I mean, in the right light.

20:59.985 --> 21:02.821
She's leaving Wild Bill.

21:04.489 --> 21:06.366
-Oh.
-Yeah.

21:09.328 --> 21:10.621
Did she give a reason?

21:10.746 --> 21:13.040
Wild Bill is not wild enough in the sack.

21:13.124 --> 21:16.543
You know, man, I'm not
that comfortable talking about this.

21:16.627 --> 21:17.461
I bet.

21:17.544 --> 21:21.257
Yeah, and apparently,
there's this Eduardo guy, who's...

21:21.340 --> 21:23.759
-Sniffing around?
-Man, yeah.

21:23.842 --> 21:26.137
No, I don't... I don't... yeah.

21:26.220 --> 21:28.639
What are you going to do?
Talk to Wild Bill?

21:28.722 --> 21:31.558
-And say what?
-I don't know.

21:31.642 --> 21:36.063
Tell him to, you know, dim the lights
and rub the balls of her feet.

21:36.147 --> 21:37.648
Maybe scented candles.

21:37.731 --> 21:38.732
Aw, Chip!

21:38.816 --> 21:41.152
Come on, Dennis. It's been a while
since I've had to give someone advice

21:41.235 --> 21:43.237
on how to satisfy
my mom in the sack, but...

21:43.321 --> 21:45.990
What, no, I don't need
that type of advice, obviously.

21:46.073 --> 21:47.532
I just... what do I...

21:47.616 --> 21:50.035
How do I tell Wild Bill about Eduardo?

21:56.416 --> 21:58.543
You tell the truth.

21:59.837 --> 22:04.925
Yeah. Then they split up,
she sells our house, and then we...

22:05.801 --> 22:08.262
Yeah, well, you've still got to do it.
It's the truth.

22:19.064 --> 22:22.776
So, I'm gonna talk to Wild Bill
when we get back, yeah?

23:00.522 --> 23:02.358
Hey, Bill.

23:04.109 --> 23:08.447
I just... wanted to come say goodbye.

23:08.530 --> 23:11.909
Yes, yes, Dennis. Goodbye.
Nice seeing you.

23:11.992 --> 23:13.577
Yeah. Yeah.

23:15.495 --> 23:19.250
This is hard for me to say. Um...

23:23.712 --> 23:26.715
How is everything
between you and Jackie?

23:26.798 --> 23:28.300
Oh.

23:28.384 --> 23:30.969
Very good.

23:31.053 --> 23:33.972
Jackie's amazing, you know?
She's doing great.

23:34.056 --> 23:40.354
Great. Great. And a lot of that
is because of you, so thank you.

23:40.438 --> 23:42.522
She means a lot to me.

23:42.606 --> 23:45.609
Yeah, yeah. Um...

23:48.362 --> 23:50.448
How's everything physically?

23:50.530 --> 23:53.409
You mean my back spasm.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.536
I'm not as long off the tee, but...

23:56.620 --> 24:02.000
No, no, no. Physic...
intimately, in the bedroom.

24:02.084 --> 24:04.503
I... Mom, can she...

24:04.586 --> 24:08.090
she can be a very...

24:08.173 --> 24:10.926
-Sexual.
-Sensual. Sensual person. Yeah.

24:11.009 --> 24:12.886
I know.

24:13.471 --> 24:17.308
So, yeah, if you ever
needed a helping hand...

24:17.391 --> 24:22.438
Oh, no. Thank you, Dennis.
That would be too weird.

24:22.521 --> 24:27.609
What? No. No, a helping...
a helping hand, like pills.

24:27.692 --> 24:32.364
You know, a doctor can get you some pills
and can possibly enhance the performance.

24:33.698 --> 24:38.036
You know... Jackie's crazy, right?

24:39.830 --> 24:41.540
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

24:41.665 --> 24:43.917
She told you about Kyle?

24:45.461 --> 24:49.173
Uh... Kyle? No, Eduardo. Who's Kyle?

24:49.256 --> 24:53.802
Kyle's the kid who delivers
our paper. He's 16.

24:55.637 --> 24:57.431
Oh, and Eduardo?

24:57.515 --> 25:01.726
Landscaper. Great guy. Very quiet.

25:01.810 --> 25:06.440
-Huh.
-And also very gay.

25:07.191 --> 25:08.192
Huh.

25:09.360 --> 25:14.823
Okay. So, she made all of this up.

25:16.116 --> 25:22.873
The call, the emergency, us...
us coming all the way out here.

25:23.582 --> 25:25.376
It's just a wild goose chase.

25:25.459 --> 25:29.171
She wanted to see you, Dennis.
She's your mother.

25:29.254 --> 25:31.256
Yeah.

25:31.340 --> 25:34.009
Why didn't she just say that?

25:34.092 --> 25:36.261
She's Jackie.

25:40.224 --> 25:41.641
Yeah.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.866
Well, take care of yourself, Jackie.

25:57.949 --> 26:00.327
I will. It was great to see you, Chip.

26:00.411 --> 26:01.786
You, too.

26:01.870 --> 26:04.081
Be good to this one.

26:04.164 --> 26:05.082
Yeah.

26:08.168 --> 26:10.754
Are you okay, honey?

26:10.837 --> 26:12.548
Did that edible hit you too hard?

26:12.631 --> 26:16.718
I'm okay, I think.
I just need to lay down.

26:16.801 --> 26:19.804
-Okay.
-Bye. Oh... Yeah, bye.

26:23.308 --> 26:26.019
Thanks for coming.
It was good to see your face.

26:27.812 --> 26:29.231
I'll call you.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.775
You've always been my man, Dennis.

26:34.570 --> 26:39.283
Since the day you were born. That's why
all of the others came and went.

26:40.534 --> 26:43.454
'Cause they couldn't compete with you.

26:51.962 --> 26:53.297
Bye, Mom.

27:21.659 --> 27:25.454
I'm not really sure
that it's going to happen,

27:25.579 --> 27:28.915
you know, between me and...

27:39.217 --> 27:43.722
-Because of today?
-No, no, no. Just because.

27:43.805 --> 27:45.724
The other night, it wasn't...

27:45.807 --> 27:49.561
it wasn't really there,
that spark, you know?

27:49.645 --> 27:50.812
Mmm.

27:54.358 --> 27:57.235
-I'm sorry, man.
-That's okay.

27:57.319 --> 27:59.697
It's not there, it's not there.

28:02.366 --> 28:04.075
And if it is, it is.

28:05.869 --> 28:09.206
And there's nothing
we can do about it, you know?

28:10.582 --> 28:15.420
Yeah, and thank you for, you know,
before, talking me down.

28:15.504 --> 28:18.507
Yeah. Yeah, no sweat.

28:18.590 --> 28:20.258
I'm glad you came today.

28:21.801 --> 28:22.802
Me, too.

28:25.013 --> 28:27.516
You're a good friend.
