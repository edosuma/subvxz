01:07.150 --> 01:10.403
You're my mom? How?

01:10.487 --> 01:13.448
How did you get to Earth?
How-- how did you meet my dad?

01:13.531 --> 01:16.242
-How-- how are you sure?
-I'm sure.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.828
This isn't how I hoped to meet you again,

01:18.912 --> 01:22.457
and this isn't how I wanted to tell you,
but it's the truth.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.626
-We can talk about this later.
-What?

01:24.709 --> 01:27.879
You drop a bomb like this
and tell me you'll explain later?

01:27.962 --> 01:30.715
We've got more important things
to deal with right now.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.927
[muffled grunt]

01:34.010 --> 01:34.844
Fine.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.765
We're going
after the enriched quintessence

01:38.848 --> 01:41.309
that created Ranveig's super weapon.

01:41.893 --> 01:42.727
What?

01:42.811 --> 01:46.147
Kolivan and I have been searching
for that quintessence for a long time.

01:46.731 --> 01:51.694
I was with Ranveig when an unmarked
cargo ship passed into his region.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.280
When we checked it out,
there was no crew aboard.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.616
The ship had been nearly torn to pieces,

01:56.699 --> 02:00.411
but inside, a single vat
of quintessence remained.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.832
It was unlike any other quintessence
we'd seen.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.000
[Keith]  Were there
navigation records aboard?

02:06.084 --> 02:08.669
[Krolia]  No, but I analyzed
the ship personally.

02:08.752 --> 02:13.007
The radiation signature indicated
it had passed through the quantum abyss.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.051
[Keith]  Quantum abyss? What's that?

02:15.802 --> 02:18.680
[Krolia]  It's a part of the galaxy
where dense neutron stars

02:18.763 --> 02:21.224
orbit even larger dark stars.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.936
In the quantum abyss,
planets and other celestial bodies

02:25.019 --> 02:27.897
are being pulled
and torn in different directions.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.650
It's a chaotic, ever-changing environment.

02:30.733 --> 02:34.195
And the presence of such massive objects
has unusual effects

02:34.279 --> 02:37.407
on gravitational waves
and space-time itself.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.660
-And that's where we're heading?
-Yes.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.207
[Lotor] Your father, King Alfor,
was a gifted alchemist,

02:46.291 --> 02:50.920
whose unique ability allowed him to infuse
the Voltron ore with Altean energy,

02:51.004 --> 02:54.841
granting it and the paladins access
to the quintessence field.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.595
Now you, Allura, possess that same gift.

03:00.847 --> 03:05.184
Our visit to Oriande has taught me more
than I ever thought possible.

03:05.768 --> 03:09.856
-Thank you.
-No, thank you, Princess.

03:09.939 --> 03:14.277
With your help, we can finally supply
the empire with quintessence.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.780
You are the key to bringing peace
to the universe.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.740
Peace.

03:19.824 --> 03:23.536
My father wanted the same thing
when he built the lions.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.498
It is an honor to follow in his footsteps
and continue his work.

03:27.582 --> 03:31.085
And to do so alongside you.

03:31.669 --> 03:36.174
Like the days of long ago,
our royal alliance will inspire others.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.386
[Pidge] You guys starting without us?

03:40.470 --> 03:42.847
[Hunk] You didn't think
to call the engineers

03:42.931 --> 03:45.808
before you began building
your inter-reality quintessence field

03:45.892 --> 03:47.435
magical Altean alchemy super ship?

03:47.518 --> 03:51.105
Right. You didn't think
to call the engineers... and me?

03:51.189 --> 03:52.774
-[stammers]
-[clanging]

03:53.983 --> 03:56.402
[metal clattering]

03:59.155 --> 04:00.198
What?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.868
[sighs] I appreciate
that you want to help.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.621
Unfortunately,
there's not a lot for you to do.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.207
Infusing the comet ore with Altean alchemy

04:09.290 --> 04:12.085
is quite different
than simply building a ship.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.420
[both] Magic.

04:14.504 --> 04:18.091
We'll certainly call you
if we're in need of assistance.

04:18.632 --> 04:19.801
Hmm. Oh, well.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.971
More time to integrate those Galra shields
with Altean tech.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.764
There's gotta be a way to do it.

04:24.847 --> 04:28.101
You sure you don't need
a third wheel for help?

04:29.143 --> 04:30.436
No?

04:46.160 --> 04:48.371
[Keith]  I think we're here.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.250
[Krolia]  Bring us in. Stay alert.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.676
[Keith]  Are you sure
we should go in there?

05:02.260 --> 05:05.513
[Krolia]  Ranveig sent probes trying
to track the quintessence.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.601
The probes picked up a path that was
relatively unaffected by space-time.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.353
[Keith] Where does the path go?

05:12.437 --> 05:15.481
[Krolia]  We never found out.
The probes were all destroyed.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.607
By what?

05:16.691 --> 05:19.193
[Krolia]  I'm not sure. Keep sharp.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.163
Huh? What is that?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.207
[snarling]

05:36.961 --> 05:38.337
-[alarm blaring]
-[gasps]

05:40.131 --> 05:41.924
[Keith] Krolia, we got trouble.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.302
We need to shake them
before they breach the hull!

05:44.385 --> 05:45.386
-[thumps]
-[grunts]

05:45.470 --> 05:46.304
[Keith]  Hang on.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.352
-[snarling]
-[gasps]

05:56.147 --> 05:57.774
Keith, what's our status?

05:57.857 --> 05:59.525
[snarling]

05:59.609 --> 06:01.944
[grunts] The ship's damaged.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.447
Thrusters are gone. I can't hold her!

06:05.114 --> 06:08.576
[grunts]  We're being pulled in!
We need to ditch!

06:21.464 --> 06:23.800
-[explosion]
-[Keith] What were those things?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.260
[Krolia] I don't know,
but they're gone now.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.762
[Keith] So is our ship.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.807
It had the coordinates to guide us
through the quantum abyss.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.601
[Krolia] We'll have to make do. Come on.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.563
As long as we stay within the borders
of the space-time drop-offs,

06:37.647 --> 06:38.648
we should be safe.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.609
[Keith] Basically, stay close
so we won't be drawn in

06:41.692 --> 06:44.278
and stretched into nothingness
like those creatures.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.238
Got it.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.037
-Huh?
-[Keith] What's going on?

06:53.121 --> 06:54.664
[rumbling]

06:58.543 --> 07:00.294
[both grunting]

07:12.849 --> 07:13.891
[sighs]

07:13.975 --> 07:15.351
[shouts]

07:16.894 --> 07:17.854
Hello?

07:17.937 --> 07:20.189
[baby crying]

07:20.273 --> 07:22.650
We'll name him "Yorak."

07:24.694 --> 07:25.903
How about "Keith"?

07:27.238 --> 07:29.282
[Krolia] "Keith." I like that.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.370
-[man] Hello, Keith.
-Huh?

07:35.580 --> 07:37.373
-[Shiro]  I know.
-[Keith]  It's okay.

07:37.457 --> 07:42.128
-We have to get back to the Castle.
-[Shiro]  ...are not going anywhere!

07:42.211 --> 07:43.671
Huh? [panting]

07:43.754 --> 07:45.173
[gasps and panting]

07:45.256 --> 07:47.633
What was that? Were those visions real?

07:48.259 --> 07:50.970
[Krolia] Time collapses this close
to dark stars.

07:51.596 --> 07:55.725
Going through the light triggers glimpses
of the past and the future.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.732
It's amazing how the Galran subroutines
translate almost one-to-one

08:02.815 --> 08:04.692
with the Altean axiom inhibitors.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.819
Okay, Lance, let's test this puppy.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.905
[beeping]

08:11.032 --> 08:15.661
Oh, I think lover boy Lance is distracted
not thinking about the princess.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.997
Ow! What the heck?

08:18.080 --> 08:18.915
Huh?

08:18.998 --> 08:23.169
Oh, Lance, could you stop daydreaming
about me and test the connection?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.838
Ha ha. Not funny.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.509
And I'm not daydreaming
about you. I mean her.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.970
That's good. Because it seems
like Allura's got a thing with Lotor.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.181
-A thing?
-Yeah, a thing.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.599
Probably gonna get married,

08:36.682 --> 08:39.936
have babies with beautiful, flowing,
white alien hair, all that stuff.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.355
He's probably proposing right now.

08:43.688 --> 08:47.235
-Princess Allura, will you marry me?
-Oh, Lotor.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.779
You bad boy, of course, I will.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.739
-[laughing]
-[groaning]

08:56.702 --> 08:57.537
[grunts]

08:58.371 --> 09:00.248
-[thrusters whoosh]
-[grunts]

09:00.331 --> 09:03.834
Keith! You're getting too close
to the gravity wells.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.086
Use your thrusters.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.462
[Keith] I'm trying!

09:15.888 --> 09:17.056
[grunts]

09:19.725 --> 09:21.352
[Krolia] Grab my hand!

09:26.399 --> 09:28.985
[beeping]

09:33.739 --> 09:35.241
Is it possible?

09:35.324 --> 09:38.035
The signature is nearly identical
to the Red Lion's.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.414
We should obtain visual confirmation
before we call it in.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.625
Negative. We've never received
another reading like this before.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.169
There's a Voltron Lion on this planet.
I'm sure of it.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.505
Call it in immediately. That's an order.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.508
I said, call it in.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.885
- Vrepit Sa.
-[accelerator clicks]

10:00.099 --> 10:02.685
You think you can take all the glory
for yourself?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.187
-I'm not looking for glory.
-[weapon firing]

10:11.319 --> 10:12.737
-[alarm beeps]
-[groans]

10:24.248 --> 10:26.417
-[grunting]
-[beeping and blaring]

10:33.716 --> 10:35.718
[explosion]

10:45.895 --> 10:47.813
[metal creaking]

10:49.649 --> 10:50.608
[grunts softly]

10:54.570 --> 10:56.614
[gasping]

11:01.202 --> 11:03.079
That's how you and Dad met.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.542
How did you know
to look for the Blue Lion on Earth?

11:08.626 --> 11:09.794
[Krolia] We didn't.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.297
After Sendak found the Red Lion,
the Galra engineered a way

11:13.381 --> 11:15.883
to pick up on the lions' signatures
from close range.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.178
Zarkon had thousands of scouts
searching for them.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.764
The Blade of Marmora made sure
to embed agents

11:21.847 --> 11:24.225
in as many of those scout teams
as possible,

11:24.308 --> 11:27.728
in an effort to prevent the Galra
from obtaining any more lions.

11:28.604 --> 11:32.108
I happened to be in the right place
at the right time.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.859
-[distant explosion]
-[rumbling]

11:33.943 --> 11:34.944
It's coming again!

11:41.534 --> 11:42.827
[grunts]

11:45.246 --> 11:48.207
[Krolia] I never thought I'd see
another lion in my lifetime.

11:48.791 --> 11:53.754
You've been telling me about this ship
for months, but this is beyond words.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.883
Are you sure you don't want me
to contact the Garrison? They could help.

11:57.967 --> 12:02.638
We've discussed this. It could put
your entire civilization in jeopardy.

12:03.222 --> 12:07.226
Does this mean you're gonna contact
your people and continue your mission?

12:08.018 --> 12:11.939
My ship being destroyed was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.150
I wouldn't go back even if I could.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.319
I have a new mission now.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.489
I'm going to stay here
and protect the Blue Lion.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.369
I want to help.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.169
[Keith] You were stuck on Earth.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.840
There was no better place I could be.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.056
-[squeaking]
-Oh, great.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.267
You guys here
to make fun of me, too?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.977
[gags and screams]

12:50.561 --> 12:52.938
What are you doing? Leave me alone!

12:53.022 --> 12:54.523
[squeaking]

12:54.607 --> 12:55.900
[groans]

12:55.983 --> 12:58.027
Can't a man sulk in peace?

12:58.110 --> 13:00.404
-[mice squeaking]
-Hmm.

13:00.488 --> 13:04.325
I'm pathetic. I used to make fun of people
who would get their hearts broken.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.577
Heck, I was the one breaking hearts!

13:06.660 --> 13:08.829
[squeaking]

13:10.080 --> 13:14.585
I guess I never knew what it meant
to like someone the way I like Allura.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.588
Allura's not like any other girl
I've ever met before.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.757
Probably because she's an alien,
but still.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.886
She's smart, courageous,
and makes me want to be a better person.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.889
That is so weird to say.

13:26.972 --> 13:30.559
And I can't tell her how I feel.
She wouldn't take me seriously anyway.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.311
I don't have anything to offer.

13:32.394 --> 13:35.731
I'm just a boy from Cuba,
not a space prince like Lotor.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.067
[snoring]

13:38.150 --> 13:39.818
Are you guys even listening?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.114
[grunting]

14:04.677 --> 14:08.055
[Keith] The rate we're going, it's gonna
take a lifetime to reach the end.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.850
[Krolia] We have to keep moving,
however long it takes.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.686
Without food and water,
we're never gonna make it.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.938
We have to come up with another plan.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.191
[rumbling]

14:23.988 --> 14:24.947
[Keith] Wha...

14:25.030 --> 14:27.408
-What are those things?
-[Krolia] I don't know.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.993
But whatever they are,

14:29.076 --> 14:32.037
these creatures seem to know their way
through the quantum abyss

14:32.121 --> 14:34.915
without being drawn
into the space-time drop-offs.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.333
[Keith] Amazing.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.380
[Krolia] Here it comes.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.591
Brace yourself!

14:55.895 --> 14:58.814
[high-pitched ringing]

15:00.107 --> 15:03.485
They're scouts. They must've picked up
the Blue Lion's signal.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.072
We need to stop them
before they report back to their command.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.867
-What's the plan?
-I have explosives.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.202
They aren't powerful enough
to destroy a fighter.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.246
If we detonate them
in the intake valves,

15:14.330 --> 15:16.040
they could stop them from taking off.

15:16.624 --> 15:20.878
When they're set, use this to detonate
the charges and take out the ships.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.630
What will you be doing?

15:23.088 --> 15:26.467
I'm gonna find out what the scouts know
and get rid of them.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.094
[engine revs]

15:42.066 --> 15:43.484
[beeping]

15:51.200 --> 15:52.159
[weapon charging]

15:52.242 --> 15:54.119
[panting]

15:55.162 --> 15:56.956
Aaah! [groans]

15:58.624 --> 16:00.417
[grunts and groans]

16:08.425 --> 16:11.512
[rapid beeping]

16:22.648 --> 16:23.857
[weapon cocks and charges]

16:23.941 --> 16:25.275
[man] Drop your weapon.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.528
I spotted her sneaking in.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.198
She was with a primitive
who was setting explosives on our ships.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.701
He's been neutralized.

16:33.784 --> 16:34.618
No!

16:37.621 --> 16:39.707
I said drop your weapon.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.053
[grunts]

17:19.872 --> 17:21.874
[groaning]

17:34.553 --> 17:35.554
I must go.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.308
I thought you'd seen enough war.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.937
If they found the Blue Lion once,
they'll find it again.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.734
I need to report back to the Blades
and stop the Galra from the inside.

17:49.818 --> 17:50.903
I'm sorry.

17:51.862 --> 17:55.032
But this is the best way for me
to keep you both safe.

17:57.701 --> 17:58.744
[kiss smacks]

18:06.126 --> 18:07.419
This is for Keith.

18:09.296 --> 18:11.173
He may need it someday.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.692
[Keith] I finally understand why you left.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.153
You put the mission above all else.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.656
[Krolia] That's not true.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.493
I left to protect the person I most love.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.245
You.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.498
-[rumbling]
-[bellowing]

18:44.581 --> 18:46.625
[Keith] It's another one
of those creatures.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.548
We have to get on that thing's back!
It might be our best chance!

18:59.805 --> 19:02.599
[panting]

19:07.563 --> 19:09.314
[groaning]

19:11.942 --> 19:12.985
[Keith] We made it.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.822
Will this thing take us through the abyss?

19:16.905 --> 19:18.574
[Krolia] We're about to find out.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.288
[wind gusting]

19:24.371 --> 19:26.665
[Krolia] It's creating its own atmosphere.

20:22.846 --> 20:26.183
Keith... I think we've made it.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.521
It's been two years.
We can finally finish our mission.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.657
[exhales]

20:47.663 --> 20:51.041
You've done much today, Princess.
You need your rest.

20:51.124 --> 20:54.086
-We'll continue tomorrow.
-There's still a long way to go,

20:54.169 --> 20:56.880
but I'm proud
of what we've accomplished together.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.677
None of this would be possible...
without you.

21:08.475 --> 21:09.476
Oh, hello, there.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.188
You look cleaner than usual.
Did someone give you a bath?

21:16.525 --> 21:19.403
What? Lance washed you?

21:19.486 --> 21:22.155
That's strange. Are you friends now?

21:22.239 --> 21:24.116
[squeaking]

21:24.199 --> 21:28.537
Really, you are?
How did this happen all of a sudden?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.873
[squeaking]

21:35.168 --> 21:36.211
Oh.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.088
He said that?

21:46.805 --> 21:49.808
-[Keith] Look, a planet.
-[Krolia] I'm picking up some readings

21:49.891 --> 21:52.602
similar to those of the quintessence
Ranveig found.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.651
This is the source of the readings.
Let's go check it out.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.613
[thumping]

22:17.085 --> 22:18.420
[Keith] What is this place?

22:21.423 --> 22:24.092
[birds chirping and singing]

22:26.970 --> 22:29.389
-[humming]
-[gasps]

22:29.473 --> 22:31.641
Wait, I hear something.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.810
[humming]

22:41.693 --> 22:44.154
[humming]

22:45.113 --> 22:46.281
[gasps]

22:48.241 --> 22:49.159
An Altean.
