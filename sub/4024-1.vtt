better things to do

13:21.468 --> 13:23.635
Nobody knows
when or how,

13:23.720 --> 13:28.390

mysteriously appeared
on the blacktop.

Nobody knew
who it belonged to.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.719

to someone eIse.

14:11.726 --> 14:12.809

14:13.269 --> 14:16.688

the Cheese Touch Frenzy.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.569

14:23.404 --> 14:28.617

Dieter Muller took it away.

was lost in translation.

Thankfully, he moved back
to DüsseIdorf and took
the Cheese Touch with him.

learning the sport
and having fun !

25:48.422 --> 25:49.881
All right. lt's not
a competition

25:49.965 --> 25:55.720
because everyone here
is already
a superstar to me.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.181
Coach Brewer,
can you step over here
for a moment,

25:58.265 --> 26:00.475
please, give me a hand?
Thanks.

(GRUNTS)

26:02.978 --> 26:04.020
(ALL EXCLAlM)

26:04.104 --> 26:06.522
That's known as
a speed takedown.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.107
Nice job,
Coach Brewer.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.443
Can you get up and
come behind me?

26:10.527 --> 26:12.862
Put one arm
over my shoulder?
Let's go, yeah.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.114
You got it, walk it off,
come on.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.953
That was known
as the arm drag.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.664
Let's give Coach Brewer
a hand, everybody!

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
He's fine.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.003
Yeah, Heffley.

26:29.463 --> 26:32.173
What about piledrivers
and Vader bombs?

26:32.258 --> 26:34.759
That is fake wrestling.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.264
This is real wrestling !
Let's go!

26:40.307 --> 26:42.934
lf l have to wrestle

he'll kill me!

26:45.354 --> 26:48.982
Okay, to keep things fair,
l've divided you into weight
categories by your size,

26:49.066 --> 26:51.985

right there.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.952
Nice head gear.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.329

let me borrow it.

Let's hear it
for our other winner.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.044
Yay, Greg !

27:52.296 --> 27:53.921
l can't lose
to Fregley again.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.007
lf l get beat by
the weirdest kid
in school,

27:56.091 --> 27:58.593
nobody's ever gonna let me
sit at their table.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.053
How are you
going to beat him?

28:00.137 --> 28:02.263
lt's like he had
superhuman strength !

28:02.598 --> 28:05.141
l'm not gonna beat him.
l'm gonna gain
1 0 pounds this week

28:05.225 --> 28:07.268
so l can move up to
the Bulldog weight class.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.063
And then you and l
can wrestle each other.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.522
Ready?

28:11.607 --> 28:13.483
Can l throw at you now?
Later.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.903
You're better at riding
than l am,
and l'm a better thrower.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.502
Greg, save some
for everybody else, honey.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.545
GREG: Can't.
l need to bulk up.

28:34.630 --> 28:35.630
Why?

28:36.256 --> 28:39.258
l think your body
looks beautiful
just the way it is.

28:39.385 --> 28:43.012
l heard he got his butt
kicked at wrestling.
Now what is wrong with you?

28:43.097 --> 28:46.474
Why would you sign up
for something
you don't have to do?

28:46.642 --> 28:48.893
You signed up for wrestling?

28:49.103 --> 28:50.103
Kind of.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.730
You never sign up
for anything at school.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.774
You fly below the radar.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.902
That way you never raise
anyone's expectations.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.947
Thank you, Rodrick,
for those words
of motivational wisdom,

29:01.031 --> 29:03.032
but perhaps
a better way
to look at it is that

29:03.117 --> 29:06.285
it's a chance
to learn to excel
at something.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.664
Well, what could
l learn at school that
l can't teach myself?

29:10.999 --> 29:12.333
Well, Greg, l think
it's great that

29:12.418 --> 29:14.710
you took the initiative
to learn something new.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.964
This is like the first step
to responsibility!

29:18.048 --> 29:21.592
My boss's son Will
was smaller than you,

29:21.677 --> 29:24.470
but he built himself up
with the weights!

29:24.555 --> 29:26.722
Yeah.
We could get you
the same equipment.

29:26.807 --> 29:31.227
You could train,
get the right
nutrition, cardio.

29:31.562 --> 29:35.189
You'd be in tip-top shape
just like Will.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.236
And it would only take,
like, three months.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.284
Three months?

29:46.368 --> 29:47.452
Yeah.

29:48.579 --> 29:50.621
l'll just stick to eating.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.670
Well, l don't know where
you put it, Heffley,

29:57.754 --> 30:00.298
but you gained 1 0 pounds
and joined
the Bulldog class.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.507
Yes.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.641
l thought
you didn't gain
any weight this week.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.518
My mom's
ankle weights.

30:14.897 --> 30:18.566
All right, bulldog Heffley.
Meet your new opponent.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.740

of Title lX?

30:25.908 --> 30:27.533
Her parents
threatened to sue,

30:27.618 --> 30:31.454
so you show her
what it's like to wrestle

a wuss, Heffley.

Make your move!

30:43.675 --> 30:45.760
She's a girl !
Where do l grab her?

30:49.389 --> 30:51.432
Stay down !

Greg ! You're famous!
Right on the front page!

31:25.842 --> 31:27.134
And if l would
have pinned her,

31:27.219 --> 31:28.719
which l could have
done easily,

31:28.804 --> 31:31.264
you know l would have
gotten in trouble
for hurting a girl.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.599
Why does she even
want to wrestle?

31:33.684 --> 31:35.810
Who knows?
Girls are very confusing.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.436
Like today,
l heard someone
in the hallway say

31:37.521 --> 31:41.524
that Bryce Anderson
has a cute butt.
What does that even mean?

31:41.608 --> 31:44.026
A butt can't be cute.
lt's a butt.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.280
l know, but that's what
they were saying.

31:47.364 --> 31:50.199
l don't see why
girls our age can't talk
just like regular people.

31:55.998 --> 31:59.000
So how are you
gonna become
a class favorite now?

31:59.084 --> 32:00.960
Two words.
Best Dressed.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.795
How are you
going to do that?

32:03.088 --> 32:04.255
Fashion is easy.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.841

and kids are impressed.

One strap is cool.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.541
But there's two straps.

put on two straps

35:28.919 --> 35:30.711
if you're only
supposed to use one?

35:30.796 --> 35:33.422

who make backpacks
aren't cool.

they'd give it
one strap,

who put the kids
in these giant pizza ovens.

to turn off the ovens.

Hey, guys.
Check it out.

51:23.914 --> 51:25.707
Oh, my gosh,
what happened?

51:25.791 --> 51:30.044
lt's a raging infection
caused by a splinter
that was left untreated.

51:30.463 --> 51:33.506
Want to be the first to sign
my sympathy sheet?

51:33.841 --> 51:34.883
No.

l'll sign it, Greg Heffley,
if you'd let me
look at your infection.

you could see where the bone
just snapped right in half.

same break last year,
and it got all purple!

Rowley a card?

52:00.534 --> 52:03.119
What? No, it's for
Bryan Little.

52:03.204 --> 52:05.538
You know, the guy who writes
the Wacky Dawg cartoons

52:05.623 --> 52:07.373

and he's going to be out
for three months.

So, just out of curiosity,
who's gonna do the cartoon?

52:17.635 --> 52:21.888
They're having tryouts,
but the important thing
is Bryan gets better.

drawing a bunch
of Zoo-wee Mamas

What?
Yeah,

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.939
and l think we can both
learn some valuable lessons
from this.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:14.402
Like, l should be more careful
what l do in front of
Mrs. lrvine's house.

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:16.529
And you, well,

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.032
you should be more careful
who you lend your coat to.

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:27.039
You know what, Greg?
You're not
a good friend.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.459
Whoa. How could
you even say that?

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:31.669

lf you were a great friend,
you would have told
Mr. Winsky the truth.

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:37.717
Okay, one thing.
You can't get mad
about just. . .

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.386
You only care
about yourself.

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.638
You hated my cartoon.

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:47.393
You made fun of my clothes.
You disrespected Joshie.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:51.063
You broke my hand
and you didn't even
seem sorry.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.858

was the best thing
that ever happened to you !

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.236

wouId bIow over.

But Rowley was still giving me
the siIent treatment.

make the first move.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:27.850

so angry at him,

it's okay for me
to sleep over tonight.

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.260
Awesome!

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:49.432
GREG: The whole thing
with Rowley is, l was willing
to let bygones be bygones.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.059
But then he made friends
with CoIIin
just to mess with me.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:53.686
As if I even care if he...

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:58.858
Well, you know what?

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:00.860

There's no
going back, Sergeant.

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:05.573
l need to board
the helicopter.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:07.533
Do you have my back?

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.994

have your back, Captain.

with some friends

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:40.357

maybe you might
want to have a sleepover?

Yeah. With who?
