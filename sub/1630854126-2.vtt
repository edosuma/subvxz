16:51.052 --> 16:53.346
things didn't work out
between you and Taylor.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.433
Oh!

16:57.433 --> 16:59.393
Oh, don't tell me
I'm breaking the news.
Uh...

16:59.393 --> 17:02.104
Ooh!
I told that child,

17:02.104 --> 17:04.357
"You have got to be
straightforward."

17:04.357 --> 17:06.484
Petering out is
just not of the Lord.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.361
Mnh-mnh!

17:08.361 --> 17:10.655
Wait, so she was
petering out on me?

17:10.655 --> 17:11.864
Do you know why?

17:11.864 --> 17:16.410
Well, I think she said
you a "broke bwah."

17:18.329 --> 17:22.500
I think she's saying
I'm a broke boi.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.378
Oh.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.420
No.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.844
I can't believe we have rats
in this school.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.472
Well, they're actually mice,
which are better than rats

17:36.472 --> 17:38.057
'cause they're
less intrusive.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.269
This lady trying to put
a positive spin on rats.

17:41.269 --> 17:45.565
Don't get it twisted.
This is a mouse house now.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.191
Look.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.402
Barbara and I weren't
trying to be mean.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.904
It's just the kind of stuff
we got to deal with around here.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.115
And that's why,
when we can get anything,

17:54.115 --> 17:55.324
we just want the basics.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.993
No, I get it.
I do.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.246
You know, I just saw Addington
and freaked.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.415
Just wanted to get
something special for Abbott

18:02.415 --> 18:04.458
so that we don't feel
like an afterthought.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.961
Mm.
Wanted us to feel
just as good,

18:06.961 --> 18:09.463
even though maybe
that just isn't true.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.300
And now it looks like we won't
be getting any of that stuff.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.010
Yeah, even if I can cut a deal
with the rat guy,

18:14.010 --> 18:16.012
we're only gonna have
like 350 bucks left.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.598
Yep.
Okay, let's just get wipes.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.266
There you go.
Yeah.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.269
The kids don't need
to feel special.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.817
Well, if that's
all you want,

18:29.817 --> 18:31.944
I can make somebody feel special
for less than $350.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.655
Ava, I've said I do not want
to go to a strip club with you.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.116
That wasn't an invitation, girl.
I just needed some ones.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.368
And lots of 'em.
[ Laughs ]

18:39.368 --> 18:42.163
But, no,
I have another idea.

18:42.163 --> 18:46.083
Thank you, Sharks,
for this one-time cash infusion.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.294
This is awesome!

18:48.294 --> 18:49.837
Abbott for the win!

18:52.006 --> 18:53.549
Whoa,
they got water ice?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.509
That's right.
Water ice at Abbott.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.636
Keep it moving.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.096
What do you have,
a computer lab?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.348
Dweebs.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.224
[ Laughs ]

19:02.224 --> 19:03.809
Yeah, you heard
the baby shark.

19:03.809 --> 19:08.439
Keep it movin', and quit staring
us down with that lazy eye.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.940
Who you think
you're talkin' to?

19:09.940 --> 19:13.402
A woman with Jersey mall hair
and too much makeup.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.363
Now take that sfigato ass
down the street.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.364
Oh.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.157
Melissa!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.159
I don't even know
what "sfigato" means

19:20.159 --> 19:21.410
and I know
that was too much.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.037
It's a very small
cup of coffee.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.955
That's not even close,
and I can say whatever I want

19:24.955 --> 19:26.290
to my stupid sister.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.586
Sister? As in the woman
that works at the other school?

19:30.586 --> 19:32.630
You have the same mom?
Y-Your sister?

19:32.630 --> 19:34.548
Yeah, yeah, good, you know
what having a sister means.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.176
Glad you're making good use
of that Penn education.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.513
Wait --
And, no, I'm not saying
another word about this.

19:40.513 --> 19:44.350
Well, um, hey,
you got to hand it to Ava.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.143
This is --
This is a blast.
Yeah.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.855
And it is so good that the kids
can feel special today.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.692
Oh, are you saying
that I was right, Barbara?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.485
Uh...no.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.698
[ Sighs ]
Oh, this is so fun.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.409
Yeah.
I just wish Gregory
could enjoy it.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.576
What's wrong
with Gregory?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.829
Well, you didn't
hear it from me,

20:04.829 --> 20:07.623
but I think he and Taylor
are on the outs.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.378
That's too bad.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.504
Yeah.

20:15.297 --> 20:18.300
Hey, Devin,
can I get a piña colada?

20:23.681 --> 20:25.766
Hey.
Hey.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.601
You okay?

20:27.601 --> 20:28.394
I will be.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.023
Thank you.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.151
You are so welcome.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.610
You're all welcome!

20:36.610 --> 20:38.237
I really killed that today.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.240
Kids happy, Janine quiet,
Gregory fine.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.075
I feel like I got
a real knack for this,

20:43.075 --> 20:46.245
like I could be president
or maybe even mayor of a school.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.455
What would you call that?

20:49.957 --> 20:51.959
How's that
petering out going?

20:51.959 --> 20:55.713
Well, it turns out that Taylor
was actually petering out on me.

20:55.713 --> 20:58.507
Whoa, she petered?

20:58.507 --> 20:59.884
That's amazing.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.510
How is that amazing?

21:01.510 --> 21:03.721
Because, man, that's what
people used to do to me.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.515
Huh? Just one more thing
we have in common.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.725
Don't take it so hard.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.393
Everybody gets dumped.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.936
If it can happen
to Michael B. Jordan,

21:10.936 --> 21:12.438
it can happen to you.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.065
Now, that white boy
sure can act.

21:15.065 --> 21:19.570
Ooh! I love those
"Back to the Future" movies.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.782
Together:
Michael J. Fox.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.033
Hmm?
