00:55.331 --> 00:56.531
It's okay, Pal.

00:56.533 --> 00:58.402
They haven't spotted us yet.

01:00.237 --> 01:02.504
I'm not going to let 'em
get you again either.

01:02.506 --> 01:03.738
I like that.

01:03.740 --> 01:06.711
Nice resounding vote
of confidence.

01:20.926 --> 01:21.927
They're here.

01:22.393 --> 01:23.629
They're here!

01:25.263 --> 01:27.264
There's a turnoff ahead,

01:27.266 --> 01:28.600
plenty of overhanging branches.

01:28.602 --> 01:30.934
Hold on, Pal, we're going to
loose 'em in the woods

01:30.936 --> 01:31.970
right now!

01:53.794 --> 01:56.394
Well, that put the
brakes on 'em, didn't it?

01:56.396 --> 01:57.328
The only thing is though,

01:57.330 --> 01:59.331
they'll just keep comin'.

01:59.333 --> 02:00.966
I'm going to have to
leave you, Pal.

02:00.968 --> 02:03.002
There are plenty of good
people out there.

02:03.004 --> 02:04.704
You just got to make sure you
choose the ones

02:04.706 --> 02:05.708
you can trust.

02:07.342 --> 02:08.544
All right, come on.

02:09.044 --> 02:10.413
It's all right.

02:12.913 --> 02:14.216
You'll be okay.

02:14.682 --> 02:15.751
It's okay.

02:16.352 --> 02:18.019
All right, now listen to me.

02:18.021 --> 02:19.590
Listen to me, all right?

02:20.556 --> 02:22.722
You're a very special
dog, you know that?

02:22.724 --> 02:25.228
One of a kind in
the whole universe.

02:25.527 --> 02:26.529
And you and me,

02:27.430 --> 02:28.295
we're pals, aren't we?

02:28.297 --> 02:30.901
We got a bond that
nobody can break.

02:31.433 --> 02:33.237
But, I gotta let you
go, you understand?

02:34.337 --> 02:35.903
Otherwise, they'll catch you.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.438
They can find me if they want,

02:37.440 --> 02:38.439
but you,

02:38.441 --> 02:40.776
you can hide, Baby,
all right?

02:40.778 --> 02:41.946
One more thing,

02:42.413 --> 02:45.447
your mind is as vast
as all of space.

02:45.449 --> 02:46.451
It is.

02:47.451 --> 02:48.787
It's a great gift.

02:49.587 --> 02:52.257
The world's just not ready
for it yet, that's all.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.593
No more time for goodbyes,

02:54.926 --> 02:56.494
you gotta go, all right?

02:56.961 --> 02:58.327
All right, you listen
to me, you run.

02:58.329 --> 02:59.461
You run! You Run like the wind!

02:59.463 --> 03:00.629
You understand? Go!

03:00.631 --> 03:01.799
Go!

03:08.808 --> 03:09.809
That's it.

03:11.876 --> 03:12.879
That's it.

03:57.558 --> 03:59.728
Get you a cool drink of water,
little fella.

04:05.533 --> 04:06.833
I don't know where
you came from,

04:06.835 --> 04:08.472
but I'm keeping you.

04:12.541 --> 04:13.843
I don't know why but

04:14.677 --> 04:15.846
I get the feeling

04:16.646 --> 04:18.781
you want me to call you, Murphy.

04:19.615 --> 04:21.548
Okay. Okay.

04:21.550 --> 04:23.687
Murphy. Murphy it is then.

04:24.688 --> 04:26.989
You don't ever have to be
afraid again, Murphy.

04:26.991 --> 04:27.991
Never!

07:21.009 --> 07:22.545
Let's do this

07:38.193 --> 07:39.359
Blah!

07:39.361 --> 07:40.162
Real funny.

07:41.163 --> 07:43.998
Come on, this house
isn't haunted.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.065
Says you.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.332
Says my dad.

07:46.334 --> 07:48.335
- No such thing as ghosts.
- Yeah?

07:48.337 --> 07:50.003
Well, there's been a
bunch of strange noises

07:50.005 --> 07:51.872
coming from that
house for years.

07:51.874 --> 07:54.108
It's a real mystery. Really.

07:54.110 --> 07:55.776
We've been here
a half hour now

07:55.778 --> 07:56.880
and nothing!

07:57.648 --> 07:59.648
Jeremy, develop some patience!

08:00.650 --> 08:02.050
Guys, stop bickering.

08:02.052 --> 08:03.218
Let's go inside.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.319
I'm not going in.

08:04.321 --> 08:06.754
Don't worry, Ricky, that's
what the drone's for.

08:06.756 --> 08:08.423
I've been practicing
a lot at home.

08:08.425 --> 08:09.795
I've gotten pretty good at it.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.428
Yeah, he's only broken
two windows

08:12.430 --> 08:14.130
and freaked out the cat.

08:14.132 --> 08:16.765
Wouldn't come out of the attic
for a week.

08:16.767 --> 08:17.803
Can you please stop?

08:18.235 --> 08:19.605
Well, he didn't.

08:23.976 --> 08:25.275
What was that?

08:25.277 --> 08:28.444
I don't know, but
it sounded bad.

08:28.446 --> 08:30.313
Maybe we should just get
out of here.

08:30.315 --> 08:32.282
- I'm with Ricky.
- Me too.

08:32.284 --> 08:34.283
Davy, can we do this
another time?

08:34.284 --> 08:36.352
We came here to
solve a mystery.

08:36.355 --> 08:38.357
Like Dad on TV,

08:39.357 --> 08:40.360
right?

08:42.193 --> 08:43.328
Everyone with me?

08:46.433 --> 08:48.131
Mega views on our
YouTube channel,

08:48.133 --> 08:49.135
money, fame.

08:50.436 --> 08:53.471
All right, I guess. I'm in.

08:53.473 --> 08:55.707
- Jenny?
- You're hosting again?

08:55.709 --> 08:56.976
- Yeah.
- Why?

08:56.978 --> 08:59.977
Well, I mean I can't help it
if I'm just right for the part.

08:59.979 --> 09:01.713
Why don't I host this time?

09:01.715 --> 09:03.815
- But you're a girl.
- Ricky, that's not...

09:03.817 --> 09:05.319
Girls don't host TV shows.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.319
Oh, why don't you call
Kelly Ripper

09:08.321 --> 09:09.657
and tell her that.

09:10.391 --> 09:12.157
- Daytime.
- Samantha Bee.

09:12.159 --> 09:13.026
Cable

09:13.028 --> 09:15.395
We're talking YouTube here,
David.

09:15.397 --> 09:17.430
Okay, fine. You got me.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.201
Next time, I promise

09:20.034 --> 09:21.066
Everybody set?

09:21.068 --> 09:22.237
- Ready.
- Ready.

09:22.870 --> 09:23.938
Wait, my coat.

09:24.739 --> 09:26.106
You look just like dad.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.372
He kind of does.

09:27.374 --> 09:28.377
Now.

09:29.211 --> 09:30.444
Slate it.

09:30.446 --> 09:32.082
Unresolved
mysteries, take one.

09:32.881 --> 09:34.415
The supernatural,

09:34.417 --> 09:35.782
the mysterious,

09:35.784 --> 09:37.051
the unexplained.

09:37.053 --> 09:38.753
Do ghostly spirits still

09:38.755 --> 09:42.091
inhabit the most darkest
and despairing houses?

09:43.226 --> 09:45.096
And most for-boarding houses.

09:46.429 --> 09:48.496
Do ghostly spirits still inhabit

09:48.498 --> 09:50.100
our darkest and most bu...

09:51.267 --> 09:52.334
Foreboding.

09:52.336 --> 09:53.938
And most for-boarding...

09:54.871 --> 09:57.339
Do ghostly spirits
still inhabit

09:57.341 --> 10:00.813
our darkest and most
foreboding houses?

10:01.445 --> 10:03.312
This is going to be awesome!

10:03.314 --> 10:05.881
We are in front of the
old Cannejo Mansion.

10:05.883 --> 10:07.884
Abandoned for nearly 80 years

10:07.886 --> 10:09.952
it is said to be haunted by the
demented soul

10:09.954 --> 10:12.156
of its former owner,
Ralph Cannejo.

10:12.523 --> 10:14.023
Ralph, Rabbit?

10:14.025 --> 10:15.559
Let's get that drone
in the air.

10:15.561 --> 10:16.763
And cut.

10:22.535 --> 10:25.501
It's so cool,
it can go almost anywhere.

10:25.503 --> 10:26.904
How are you going in?

10:26.906 --> 10:28.337
It's kind of puny to

10:28.339 --> 10:29.872
ram it through the front door,

10:29.874 --> 10:30.908
don't you think?

10:30.910 --> 10:32.847
Second floor, broken window.

10:47.293 --> 10:48.393
We're in.

10:48.395 --> 10:49.897
Let's check downstairs.

10:54.067 --> 10:55.835
Good picture too.

10:55.837 --> 10:57.205
I know, right?

10:59.072 --> 11:00.906
Looks scary, even from out here.

11:00.908 --> 11:03.178
Glad I didn't have to
go in there for real.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.916
What's that?

11:09.351 --> 11:10.517
Who's playing the piano?

11:10.519 --> 11:11.921
I can't watch this.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.891
Dave, turn the drone back,
quick!

11:17.892 --> 11:20.561
Still don't believe in ghost,
Jeremy?

11:20.563 --> 11:22.566
Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea.

11:23.132 --> 11:24.231
We're committed.

11:24.233 --> 11:25.933
You should be committed.

11:25.935 --> 11:26.933
Stop. Stop.

11:26.935 --> 11:28.805
Let's go upstairs, take a look.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.919
- Over there!
- I see it! I see it!

11:54.131 --> 11:55.466
Classic cat scare.

12:13.653 --> 12:14.652
Run! Run!

12:14.654 --> 12:16.019
Go. Go. Go.

12:16.021 --> 12:17.921
Let's get out of here.

12:17.923 --> 12:19.657
- Dang it!
- Come on guys.

12:19.659 --> 12:22.091
Forget that,
let's head for the bushes!

12:22.093 --> 12:23.561
- Come on!
- Go!

12:23.563 --> 12:24.866
Wait for me.

12:29.202 --> 12:30.701
Look at 'em go, why don't ya.

12:30.703 --> 12:32.272
We scared 'em but good.

12:32.673 --> 12:33.672
Hey, how'd you come up with

12:33.674 --> 12:35.240
alien lobster scream?

12:35.242 --> 12:36.207
Fantastic.

12:36.209 --> 12:38.076
Years of watching science
fiction movies.

12:38.078 --> 12:39.079
Oh.

12:39.379 --> 12:40.413
Think they'll be back?

12:40.415 --> 12:42.280
Would you if you were a kid?

12:42.282 --> 12:44.417
These masks, all I've got
to say is,

12:44.419 --> 12:45.451
good thinking.

12:45.453 --> 12:47.720
Mm-hm, we had 'em,
we used 'em.

12:47.722 --> 12:49.956
And, we scored a neat-o

12:49.958 --> 12:51.457
mini-drone in the process.

12:51.459 --> 12:53.125
Oh, yeah!

12:54.963 --> 12:56.132
So, what now?

12:56.632 --> 12:58.301
Well, back to business.

13:04.605 --> 13:06.106
- Aliens!
- Aliens!

13:06.108 --> 13:08.442
- Aliens!
- Isn't it great?

13:08.444 --> 13:10.142
They can't have been aliens.

13:10.144 --> 13:11.144
Can't have been.

13:11.146 --> 13:12.647
No such thing, right?

13:12.649 --> 13:14.147
They were aliens,

13:14.149 --> 13:16.050
just like on Dad's show.

13:16.052 --> 13:18.585
- But that's a TV show, Ricky.
- What are you saying?

13:18.587 --> 13:20.220
Why don't you tell him about
the tooth fairy

13:20.222 --> 13:21.689
while you're at it, Brainiac.

13:21.691 --> 13:23.690
- Huh?
- Never mind.

13:23.692 --> 13:24.694
So, what now?

13:25.629 --> 13:26.560
We go home and check out
today's footage.

13:26.562 --> 13:29.031
I think we got some
really good stuff.

13:29.033 --> 13:30.566
I think Dad's going to
love it.

13:30.568 --> 13:32.370
It's just like his program.

14:01.733 --> 14:03.134
Do you think they'll
catch on?

14:03.136 --> 14:05.736
Who, the shoe company?
They don't care.

14:05.738 --> 14:07.337
They care if they're
being bootlegged.

14:07.339 --> 14:09.340
Whoa, we're not bootleggers,

14:09.342 --> 14:10.674
we're entrepreneurs/

14:10.676 --> 14:11.808
Buy cheap shoes,

14:11.810 --> 14:12.643
add a free logo,

14:12.645 --> 14:14.444
sell it online for a
hundred bucks.

14:14.446 --> 14:15.780
We make money;
the people who make the

14:15.782 --> 14:16.582
fake logos make money.

14:16.584 --> 14:18.449
It's a win-win.
Nobody gets hurt.

14:18.451 --> 14:19.453
Nobody.

14:19.820 --> 14:20.819
Come on, let's speed this up.

14:20.821 --> 14:22.120
What do you think this is,

14:22.122 --> 14:22.724
I Love Lucy?

14:24.124 --> 14:25.426
Oh right, with the...

14:26.093 --> 14:27.428
Come on.

14:46.147 --> 14:47.350
The supernatural,

14:47.650 --> 14:48.648
the mysterious,

14:48.650 --> 14:49.685
the unexplained,

14:50.486 --> 14:52.219
I'm Steven Hill, and this is

14:52.221 --> 14:54.024
Unresolved Mysteries.

14:59.361 --> 15:01.394
The time, 5:15 PM.

15:01.396 --> 15:03.331
The date, October 7th.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.732
The place, a dusty road
in New Mexico

15:05.734 --> 15:06.835
nearly six years ago.

15:06.837 --> 15:08.535
Doctor Roland Masters,

15:08.537 --> 15:11.239
speeds along a desert road

15:11.241 --> 15:12.573
something unknown.

15:12.575 --> 15:14.274
Something witnesses claim

15:14.276 --> 15:15.746
was not of this earth.

15:17.546 --> 15:19.247
Masters, a former employee

15:19.249 --> 15:21.382
at the Galactatek Research
Facility

15:21.384 --> 15:23.718
left his job early that day,

15:23.720 --> 15:25.154
but was not missed

15:25.156 --> 15:26.255
for over an hour.

15:26.257 --> 15:28.424
It's okay little guy,
they're not going to get ya.

15:28.426 --> 15:30.159
They may get me, but not you.

15:30.161 --> 15:31.095
I'll see to that.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.599
According to a former
Galactatek employee

15:36.601 --> 15:37.667
who was willing to speak to

15:37.669 --> 15:40.503
Unresolved Mysteries under
the guise of anonymity,

15:40.505 --> 15:42.138
Doctor Masters took with him

15:42.140 --> 15:44.840
the super secret project he had
been working on.

15:44.842 --> 15:47.611
One local farmer
was an eye witness

15:47.613 --> 15:49.813
to what transpired next.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.282
I was putting my goats back
in the barn and all of a sudden

15:52.284 --> 15:53.917
these two wild saucers

15:53.919 --> 15:55.856
come blaring by in the sky.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.494
This guy, he was in a
car trying to escape,

16:04.496 --> 16:05.830
but he finally gave up,

16:05.832 --> 16:07.836
and pulled off to the
side of the road.

16:08.836 --> 16:11.335
This is when it got really
interesting.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.504
These saucers were
just floating there.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.672
Just floating.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.908
They're making this noise.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.379
Very irritating noise.

16:25.853 --> 16:26.855
And then,

16:27.555 --> 16:29.358
he goes up.

16:33.594 --> 16:37.230
This little puppy was there
just staring at the whole thing.

16:37.232 --> 16:38.867
This was very overwhelming.

16:39.301 --> 16:41.635
I, I, I still don't believe
my eyes.

16:41.637 --> 16:44.407
It's aliens!

16:46.742 --> 16:49.242
Just exactly what happened
on that ominous day

16:49.244 --> 16:50.977
may never be known for sure.

16:50.979 --> 16:52.746
Why did Doctor Masters

16:52.748 --> 16:54.747
suddenly plan his escape?

16:54.749 --> 16:58.286
What is the intriguing
secret he was so anxious

16:58.288 --> 17:00.921
to keep from the world?

17:00.923 --> 17:03.160
Goodbye, and keep watching

17:03.793 --> 17:04.794
the sky.

17:31.923 --> 17:34.023
There it is, just like before.

17:34.025 --> 17:36.760
I don't understand,
we all saw the aliens

17:36.762 --> 17:37.894
now they're not there.

17:37.896 --> 17:39.029
It's just static.

17:39.031 --> 17:42.032
Did you do something weird,
David?

17:42.034 --> 17:45.035
I dropped the monitor
when we were running away.

17:45.037 --> 17:46.571
But wait, maybe I can
still get

17:46.573 --> 17:48.242
a clear frame or two.

17:52.045 --> 17:54.278
There, that's the
best I've got.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.281
It's kind of there,

17:56.283 --> 17:57.447
but not really.

17:57.449 --> 17:59.918
I see it, David, clear as day.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.487
You might see it, but no one's
going to believe us on that.

18:02.489 --> 18:03.490
My dad will.

18:04.592 --> 18:07.359
He's solved cases with much
less evidence than this.

18:07.361 --> 18:08.960
Yeah, you're right, Rick.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.296
And, he's going to be home
a lot more now.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.765
Maybe this is our silver lining.

18:12.767 --> 18:13.699
Silver lining?

18:13.701 --> 18:16.335
Yeah, we haven't
told you guys this yet,

18:16.337 --> 18:18.941
but Unsolved Mysteries
was canceled.

18:19.607 --> 18:22.642
Oh man, I'm sorry.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.779
He'll find another show to do.

18:25.079 --> 18:26.615
I hope so.

18:39.996 --> 18:42.329
So, what was the source of the
mysterious

18:42.331 --> 18:43.466
five-tone signal?

18:44.366 --> 18:45.098
Will we ever know,

18:45.100 --> 18:46.502
or will it remain,

18:47.003 --> 18:48.338
unresolved?

18:48.806 --> 18:51.472
As many of you know,
this is our last show,

18:51.474 --> 18:52.807
and we wanted to thank you for

18:52.809 --> 18:54.009
three years of dedication.

18:54.011 --> 18:55.876
From the cast, the crew,

18:55.878 --> 18:57.014
goodbye,

18:57.548 --> 19:00.550
and keep watching the skies.

19:07.425 --> 19:09.392
And cut.

19:09.394 --> 19:12.031
Thank you everybody,
it's been mysterious.

19:13.098 --> 19:15.033
Thanks everybody. Thank you.

19:15.867 --> 19:17.767
- Patrick!
- Thank you, Steven.

19:17.769 --> 19:19.703
Oh, thank you very much,
brother.

19:19.705 --> 19:22.071
Nice work, as always.

19:22.073 --> 19:24.074
Hey, Steve, where would you
like me to put this stuff

19:24.076 --> 19:25.009
from your trailer?

19:25.011 --> 19:27.411
Uh, just put it in the back
of my car,

19:27.413 --> 19:28.481
it's open, Billy.

19:28.947 --> 19:30.414
- You got it.
- Cool. Thank you.

19:30.416 --> 19:32.449
Thank you guys. Everybody.

19:32.451 --> 19:33.817
You've been...
I like you a lot!

20:05.820 --> 20:08.391
Billy, was born in a barn.

20:38.555 --> 20:40.557
Incoming message.

20:42.559 --> 20:43.727
Incoming message.

20:45.195 --> 20:47.062
Sorry to interrupt, sir,
but I think

20:47.064 --> 20:48.564
we may have gotten a hit

20:48.566 --> 20:50.802
- On what?
- The dog, sir.

20:51.469 --> 20:53.201
Was the satellite imaging
retained?

20:53.203 --> 20:56.107
It's here, in New
Mexico, right here.

20:57.475 --> 20:59.508
Get our best operative
on it now.

20:59.510 --> 21:00.945
The chip has been react...

21:05.483 --> 21:07.249
Galactatek
security mission, Team A1.

21:07.251 --> 21:10.487
Jack Bowser is in pursuit
of female operative.

21:10.489 --> 21:12.957
Descending for a closer look
and additional surveillance

21:12.959 --> 21:14.494
and possible backup.

22:21.264 --> 22:22.763
Surprise.

22:22.765 --> 22:23.766
Darn it!

22:25.968 --> 22:26.970
Hi, Jack.

22:28.772 --> 22:30.839
Come on, Jack, how many times
do I have to tell you,

22:30.841 --> 22:33.007
don't lose sight of the quarry.

22:33.009 --> 22:34.612
Technology isn't enough.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.312
Thank you Miss McGillicuddy
you can leave now.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.247
- Thank you dear.
- Let me help you.

22:39.249 --> 22:40.251
Jack!

22:46.157 --> 22:48.160
Turn it off.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.170
I think I may have
dislocated my shoulder,

22:59.837 --> 23:00.736
or worse.

23:00.738 --> 23:01.905
I could put that back in.

23:01.907 --> 23:03.173
Get away from me.

23:05.678 --> 23:08.345
Natasha, drop everything,
Crowder wants you.

23:08.347 --> 23:11.082
I think we may have a problem
here, Zoey.

23:11.084 --> 23:12.682
Jack, you klutz.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.086
If you broke my arm...

23:14.354 --> 23:16.556
What do you mean
she broke her arm?

23:17.090 --> 23:18.693
- Yes, sir.
- And I get Jack Bowser?

23:19.926 --> 23:21.727
Cheese and crackers,

23:21.729 --> 23:23.730
Williams, can you do
nothing right?

23:44.786 --> 23:45.918
Are you all right?

23:45.920 --> 23:48.187
I liked it when Dad was on
his show

23:48.189 --> 23:50.288
Yeah, but at least you get
to see him more.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.291
But I liked seeing him on TV.

23:52.293 --> 23:54.361
Do you think he'll really help
us with our case?

23:54.363 --> 23:55.695
Yeah, sure.

23:55.697 --> 23:56.697
He'll...

23:56.699 --> 23:57.701
It's Dad.

23:59.135 --> 24:01.434
Dad! Dad's home!

24:01.436 --> 24:03.037
- Come on!
- Ricky, wait up.

24:03.039 --> 24:04.040
Hi, honey.

24:04.674 --> 24:05.672
How's it going?

24:05.674 --> 24:07.345
- Daddy.
- Hey, buddy.

24:09.178 --> 24:10.345
Did you have a good day?

24:10.347 --> 24:11.348
I did.

24:12.049 --> 24:12.948
How you doing?

24:12.950 --> 24:15.019
- Wonderful.
- Yeah? Good. Good. good.

24:15.452 --> 24:17.184
Ricky, can you grab
something out of there?

24:17.186 --> 24:19.055
- Yeah.
- I got a bag.

24:23.860 --> 24:25.763
- You got it, bud?
- Yeah.

24:27.732 --> 24:28.767
Good.

24:29.734 --> 24:30.702
Go, go, go, go.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.785
Here we are boys.

24:46.452 --> 24:49.255
And this is okay to eat
with your hands.

24:50.389 --> 24:53.158
Ah, ah, wait until your
mother sits.

24:54.761 --> 24:55.763
Thanks.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.770
Honey, it will be good for you

25:05.772 --> 25:07.472
to spend the summer with
the kids,

25:07.474 --> 25:10.174
and then you'll just walk into
another shown next season.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.376
Yeah, I don't know about that.

25:11.378 --> 25:14.346
It's just that these shows,
I think their days are done,

25:14.348 --> 25:15.514
you know?

25:15.516 --> 25:16.718
Honey.

25:20.220 --> 25:22.487
No, no, we are
going to be fine.

25:22.489 --> 25:25.023
We are going to have a
great summer

25:25.025 --> 25:26.696
We sure are, Dad.

25:28.330 --> 25:32.498
Oh, check this out.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.333
What have they been up to?

25:34.335 --> 25:37.006
I have no idea.

25:37.872 --> 25:39.805
What is this?
Look at that.

25:39.807 --> 25:41.140
Don't push the button,

25:41.142 --> 25:42.175
you're as bad as they are.

25:42.177 --> 25:43.447
It's on now.

25:59.529 --> 26:00.562
There it was, Dad.

26:00.564 --> 26:01.930
Did you see it?

26:01.932 --> 26:03.899
I don't know, I saw
something.

26:03.901 --> 26:05.065
It's just like your show, Dad,

26:05.067 --> 26:06.567
but like real life.

26:06.569 --> 26:08.870
Well, if I learned anything
doing my show it's that,

26:08.872 --> 26:10.404
extraordinary claims...

26:10.406 --> 26:13.275
Require
extraordinary proof.

26:13.277 --> 26:15.076
Yeah, well you did say
you dropped it

26:15.078 --> 26:16.144
when you ran away.

26:16.146 --> 26:18.980
Maybe some sci-fi footage
bled in or something.

26:18.982 --> 26:20.449
Come on, dad.

26:20.451 --> 26:22.151
Ghost in the machine, son.

26:22.153 --> 26:23.486
Ghosts in the machine.

26:23.488 --> 26:25.086
There's a ghost
in the machine?

26:25.088 --> 26:26.922
No, no, no, it's just an
expression, Ricky.

26:26.924 --> 26:27.990
It's okay.

26:27.992 --> 26:29.558
Listen, I'm really, really happy
that you guys are

26:29.560 --> 26:30.594
figuring things out,

26:30.596 --> 26:31.994
that you're looking into things.

26:31.996 --> 26:33.564
In fact, I'm proud of you.

26:33.566 --> 26:35.501
It shows great instincts.

26:36.268 --> 26:38.434
How about this, I'll make you
a deal.

26:38.436 --> 26:40.103
If you guys give me a day

26:40.105 --> 26:41.471
I promise to go with you

26:41.473 --> 26:43.606
to the old Cannejo house,

26:43.608 --> 26:45.843
and we'll figure this out
together.

26:45.845 --> 26:46.845
Yeah, okay?

26:46.847 --> 26:47.980
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:47.982 --> 26:52.016
All right guys, ribs aren't
going to eat themselves.

26:52.018 --> 26:53.821
Hey, get some food, guys.

27:05.498 --> 27:06.500
The dog is back.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.202
The dog's back?

27:08.869 --> 27:10.168
Dog's back?

27:10.170 --> 27:11.840
Dog is back.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.106
The dog is back.

27:14.108 --> 27:15.206
Dog's back.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.278
- Doggie...
- It's not code, Jack.

27:17.511 --> 27:20.213
- He mean's Murphy.
- Oh.

27:20.215 --> 27:22.214
Which means, he can lead us
to Masters.

27:22.216 --> 27:23.550
Professor Masters?

27:23.552 --> 27:24.520
Well done, Jack.

27:25.387 --> 27:26.919
- But we have him in custody.
- What?

27:26.921 --> 27:28.288
No, no, Jack.

27:28.290 --> 27:29.422
Uh, yeah.

27:29.424 --> 27:30.924
I saw it on
Unresolved Mysteries.

27:30.926 --> 27:32.224
No, Jack. No.

27:32.226 --> 27:33.525
That's reality TV.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.529
It's not real. Not real, Jack.

27:35.531 --> 27:38.232
But we did have him
close, hands up

27:38.234 --> 27:39.266
ready to give up.

27:39.268 --> 27:40.269
But?

27:41.103 --> 27:43.169
The dog was Galactatek
property,

27:43.171 --> 27:44.842
and Masters stole him.

27:45.140 --> 27:48.175
Now, the GPS chip went off
when they left the facility.

27:48.177 --> 27:50.478
We dispatched a reacquisition
team on a pair of

27:50.480 --> 27:52.947
prototype anti-gravity
sky sleds.

27:52.949 --> 27:54.448
When they finally cornered him

27:54.450 --> 27:56.150
Masters set the dog free.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.488
Vanished, not seen for
six years.

27:59.657 --> 28:00.590
Sky sleds.

28:00.592 --> 28:02.456
That seems like an awful
lot of trouble

28:02.458 --> 28:03.624
for a runaway
Jack Russel.

28:03.626 --> 28:06.027
That's no ordinary
Jack Russel.

28:06.029 --> 28:07.663
Masters altered the dog's brain

28:07.665 --> 28:08.931
giving him human-like thought,

28:08.933 --> 28:09.535
even telepathy.

28:10.402 --> 28:11.871
That's nonsense.

28:12.069 --> 28:13.669
Well, believe what you want,
just get me

28:13.671 --> 28:15.170
Masters and get me that dog.

28:15.172 --> 28:16.407
On my way.

28:18.509 --> 28:19.508
Why'd you break your arm?

28:19.510 --> 28:21.209
He broke my arm, sir.

28:21.211 --> 28:22.248
Get after him.

28:22.647 --> 28:24.214
Try to keep him alive.

28:24.216 --> 28:26.083
We need his father's money.

28:26.085 --> 28:27.086
Got it.

28:29.422 --> 28:30.891
Anti-gravity sleds?

28:31.723 --> 28:34.024
Let's just say they were
reverse engineered.

28:34.026 --> 28:35.028
From what?

28:36.028 --> 28:38.097
I'll let you figure that out.

28:47.441 --> 28:49.975
Dad's right, maybe those space
creatures we saw

28:49.977 --> 28:51.075
weren't really there.

28:51.077 --> 28:52.277
But we saw them.

28:52.279 --> 28:54.412
We saw something,

28:54.414 --> 28:55.714
but it might be what Dad said.

28:55.716 --> 28:58.152
<i>mind if I</i>
take a look?

28:58.418 --> 29:00.419
You've seen it
a million times, bro.

29:00.421 --> 29:01.590
I didn't say that.

29:02.656 --> 29:03.357
Well, who did?

29:04.258 --> 29:06.260
<i>It was me,</i>
Murphy!

29:06.994 --> 29:09.362
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,</i>
easy kids, easy.

29:09.364 --> 29:10.230
Where are you?

29:10.232 --> 29:12.499
Show yourself before I call
my dad.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.636
Yeah, come on out,

29:14.470 --> 29:16.169
slow and easy.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.537
<i>Well, that's good,</i>
because that's the way

29:17.539 --> 29:19.472
<i>I always roll, kids.</i>

29:19.474 --> 29:20.640
<i>Now, here I come.</i>

29:20.642 --> 29:22.308
<i>No swinging or throwing.</i>

29:22.310 --> 29:23.312
No promises.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.617
Okay, I'll trust you.

29:29.051 --> 29:30.484
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

29:30.486 --> 29:31.485
Double whoa.

29:31.487 --> 29:32.686
Make that a triple.

29:32.688 --> 29:33.788
<i>What's the matter?</i>

29:33.790 --> 29:36.023
<i>You guys never met a dog before?</i>

29:36.025 --> 29:37.424
Not a talking one.

29:37.426 --> 29:40.193
<i>Well, technically</i>
I think at you, kid,

29:40.195 --> 29:41.695
<i>but I understand the confusion.</i>

29:41.697 --> 29:44.532
But how do you think at us?

29:44.534 --> 29:46.201
<i>Uh, now that's a</i>
mystery

29:46.203 --> 29:48.037
<i>even I haven't solved yet.</i>

29:48.039 --> 29:49.570
<i>I figure we could swap cases.</i>

29:49.572 --> 29:51.373
<i>I help you with</i>
your crazy aliens,

29:51.375 --> 29:52.374
<i>and you can help me find out</i>

29:52.376 --> 29:54.777
<i>why I'm the only dog who can</i>
do this trick.

29:54.779 --> 29:56.544
But dogs do lots of tricks.

29:56.546 --> 29:59.249
<i>I don't see Benji,</i>
or Beethoven doing this one.

29:59.251 --> 30:00.550
How'd you get here, Murph?

30:00.552 --> 30:02.418
<i>I hitched a ride home</i>
with your dad.

30:02.420 --> 30:03.720
Are you an alien?

30:03.722 --> 30:04.753
Really?

30:04.755 --> 30:05.888
<i>Funny you should ask.</i>

30:05.890 --> 30:08.724
<i>All I know is one day I was</i>
puppy doing puppy stuff,

30:08.726 --> 30:10.726
<i>and the next day I could read</i>
Aristotle,

30:10.728 --> 30:13.163
<i>in the original</i>
Greek, thank you.

30:13.165 --> 30:14.831
<i>Oh, that feels good.</i>

30:14.833 --> 30:16.766
<i>Hey, mind if I take a look</i>
at that video?

30:16.768 --> 30:18.170
Yeah, sure.

30:19.639 --> 30:23.139
<i>Mmm,</i>
very interesting.

30:23.141 --> 30:24.074
What do you think, Murph?

30:24.076 --> 30:27.078
Is it a real mystery or
just bad video?

30:27.080 --> 30:28.312
<i>Well,</i>
it's hard to tell.

30:28.314 --> 30:30.247
<i>Back at Galactatek they got</i>
some nerd

30:30.249 --> 30:32.751
<i>who could freeze the frame and</i>
enhance the image,

30:32.753 --> 30:34.285
<i>but I'm not going back there,</i>

30:34.287 --> 30:35.786
<i>even for you guys.</i>

30:35.788 --> 30:38.122
<i>If only I knew someone like that</i>
out here.

30:38.124 --> 30:39.791
Why didn't I think
of this sooner?

30:39.793 --> 30:41.793
You're right, he'll figure
this out in seconds.

30:41.795 --> 30:43.128
<i>Who will figure</i>
this out?

30:43.130 --> 30:44.629
- The brain!
- The brain.

30:44.631 --> 30:45.796
Yeah, he's a genius when

30:45.798 --> 30:47.632
it comes to electronic
stuff like this.

30:47.634 --> 30:49.168
<i>Well, get him</i>
over here.

30:49.170 --> 30:51.336
It's too late,
it's almost dark,

30:51.338 --> 30:52.471
but we'll take you to the
clubhouse

30:52.473 --> 30:53.506
first thing in the morning.

30:53.508 --> 30:55.842
Yeah, that's where all of
his cool stuff is.

30:55.844 --> 30:56.776
<i>Okay.</i>

30:56.778 --> 30:58.710
<i>Hey, if we're not, you know,</i>
sleuthing

30:58.712 --> 31:00.212
<i>any chance I could snag a few</i>
scraps

31:00.214 --> 31:01.514
<i>from tonight's leftovers?</i>

31:01.516 --> 31:02.682
Sure, no problem.

31:02.684 --> 31:03.749
Yeah, just wait right here.

31:03.751 --> 31:04.884
Should we tell Dad?

31:04.886 --> 31:06.085
No, wait.

31:06.087 --> 31:09.222
This is our mystery, we don't
need an adult to help us.

31:09.224 --> 31:11.060
Okay, okay.

31:14.864 --> 31:16.430
<i>Are there any</i>
ribs left?

31:16.432 --> 31:17.564
Plenty.

31:17.566 --> 31:19.537
<i>I love these kids!</i>

31:31.748 --> 31:35.250
<i>Sir? Sir?</i>
Wake up, sir.

31:35.252 --> 31:36.785
Wilson, is that you?

31:36.787 --> 31:39.922
<i>I fail to see who</i>
else it could possibly be, sir.

31:39.924 --> 31:41.356
What time is it?

31:41.358 --> 31:43.459
<i>Some ungodly hour</i>
as usual.

31:43.461 --> 31:44.926
<i>There's a perfectly good bed</i>

31:44.928 --> 31:47.298
<i>in your perfectly good</i>
bedroom, sir.

31:47.764 --> 31:48.596
Has there been a breach?

31:48.598 --> 31:50.901
<i>Uh, no sir,</i>
no breach.

31:50.903 --> 31:53.170
<i>We remain secure.</i>

31:53.172 --> 31:54.404
Then why did you wake
me up?

31:54.406 --> 31:56.439
<i>I thought it would</i>
be funny,

31:56.441 --> 31:58.611
<i>also, they found your dog.</i>

31:59.377 --> 32:00.178
Murph?

32:01.612 --> 32:03.779
- Where?
<i>- New Mexico, sir.</i>

32:03.781 --> 32:06.719
<i>At the residence of a man</i>
named, Steven Hill.

32:09.656 --> 32:10.922
Oh now, they'll be waiting
for me

32:10.924 --> 32:12.589
to come and get him,
won't they?

32:12.591 --> 32:13.790
<i>The</i>
probability is they

32:13.792 --> 32:15.760
<i>are more interested in the dog</i>

32:15.762 --> 32:16.694
<i>than you, sir.</i>

32:16.696 --> 32:18.596
Well, I'm going to go get
him anyway.

32:18.598 --> 32:19.896
Arrange my transportation.

32:19.898 --> 32:23.601
Use the standard
misdirection protocol.

32:23.603 --> 32:25.937
Pack me a small valise, and, oh,

32:25.939 --> 32:27.606
remember to get my umbrella.

32:27.608 --> 32:28.906
Whatever you wish,
sir.

32:28.908 --> 32:32.543
Oh, Wilson, where
would I be without you?

32:32.545 --> 32:34.815
<i>You'd be a</i>
complete wreck, sir.

32:36.684 --> 32:37.848
Most likely that's true.

32:37.850 --> 32:39.854
<i>I'll fetch the car,</i>
sir.

32:40.655 --> 32:43.822
Oh, and don't try to engage
it in conversation, Wilson.

32:43.824 --> 32:45.125
It's just a car.

32:45.127 --> 32:48.831
<i>That car has a lot</i>
to say if you care to listen.

33:13.923 --> 33:15.023
What are you listening to?

33:15.025 --> 33:17.726
- Yeah, that's odd.
- Creep-o-man.

33:17.728 --> 33:19.564
Yeah, Shelton, what gives?

33:19.863 --> 33:22.630
Well, I'm trying to get the
telemetry from the ISS,

33:22.632 --> 33:24.399
but this is what I got.

33:24.401 --> 33:25.937
Weird!

33:27.471 --> 33:28.938
So let me get this straight,

33:28.940 --> 33:32.475
last night you two found
a talking dog under your bed?

33:32.477 --> 33:33.676
Correct.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.945
And he agreed to help us with
our mystery

33:35.947 --> 33:37.947
if we help him with his?

33:37.949 --> 33:39.481
Does that about sum it up?

33:39.483 --> 33:40.783
That's the deal.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.818
Some deal! Go fish!

33:42.820 --> 33:44.955
- No, really.
- No, really.

33:44.957 --> 33:46.957
Then where's the talking dog?

33:46.959 --> 33:49.625
Come on guys, extraordinary
claims require...

33:49.627 --> 33:51.964
Extraordinary
proof!

33:52.530 --> 33:55.032
<i>How's this for</i>
extraordinary proof?

33:55.034 --> 33:57.401
<i>Hey kids, what's the plan?</i>

33:57.403 --> 33:59.002
<i>I love a good plan.</i>

33:59.004 --> 34:00.872
This seems highly unlikely.

34:00.874 --> 34:02.006
Unlikely?

34:02.008 --> 34:04.675
You're making this
seem possible.

34:04.677 --> 34:07.377
<i>Hey, nothing's</i>
impossible, kids.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.380
He's a dog and he's
talking.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.983
And he's a dog, and he's
talking

34:11.985 --> 34:13.918
Technically he's thinking,

34:13.920 --> 34:16.587
but we understand your
confusion, right Murph?

34:16.589 --> 34:17.554
<i>That's right, Rick.</i>

34:17.556 --> 34:20.527
This fits no mode of
terrestrial reality.

34:20.860 --> 34:21.859
I need to under...

34:21.860 --> 34:23.360
Shut it down, Shelton.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.531
You're drowning
us in your words.

34:25.533 --> 34:26.931
<i>Don't let her get</i>
to your, bro,

34:26.934 --> 34:28.033
<i>it's good to be smart.</i>

34:28.034 --> 34:29.600
So, what's the deal, pooch?

34:29.601 --> 34:30.837
<i>I wish I knew,</i>
Blondie.

34:30.839 --> 34:33.972
<i>That's why I need you guys to</i>
help me solve the mystery

34:33.974 --> 34:36.409
<i>of why I can do what I can do.</i>

34:36.411 --> 34:39.112
<i>And in return I'll get the</i>
alien puzzle unraveled

34:39.114 --> 34:40.913
<i>before the sun goes down.</i>

34:40.915 --> 34:42.047
<i>What do you say?</i>

34:42.049 --> 34:43.750
- I'm down.
- Me too.

34:43.752 --> 34:45.621
I guess we can't say, no.

34:46.487 --> 34:48.757
And after all, you are talking.

34:49.091 --> 34:50.591
Thinking.

34:50.592 --> 34:52.428
And besides, you're cute.

34:53.128 --> 34:55.094
<i>Aw, shucks,</i>
thanks, Jen.

34:55.097 --> 34:56.830
<i>I haven't had this much love</i>
and affection

34:56.831 --> 34:57.968
<i>in a dog's age.</i>

34:59.068 --> 35:01.468
<i>Hey Brain, were you able to</i>
enhance that image?

35:01.470 --> 35:02.971
Best I can do in short notice.

35:02.973 --> 35:03.971
What do you think, Murph?

35:03.973 --> 35:06.007
<i>Frankly, I think</i>
someone's got to

35:06.009 --> 35:08.509
<i>go in that house and find</i>
exactly what's going on.

35:08.511 --> 35:10.145
My parents will ground me

35:10.147 --> 35:12.147
if they find out I went inside!

35:12.149 --> 35:13.482
Never mind my parents,

35:13.484 --> 35:15.516
I'm not going in because
I'm sane.

35:15.518 --> 35:17.018
<i>Okay, here's the</i>
plan.

35:17.020 --> 35:17.986
<i>You guys can wait outside,</i>

35:17.988 --> 35:18.990
<i>and I'll go in!</i>

35:19.557 --> 35:20.655
Are you sure, Murph?

35:20.657 --> 35:22.524
Yeah, it could be dangerous.

35:22.526 --> 35:24.494
<i>Danger is</i>
my middle name.

35:24.496 --> 35:25.961
<i>Actually, it's my dad's</i>
middle name.

35:25.963 --> 35:27.997
<i>Cautious is my middle name.</i>

35:27.999 --> 35:30.069
<i>What have I gotten myself</i>
into?

35:41.980 --> 35:43.882
Fascinating.

35:50.157 --> 35:51.525
Well,

35:52.025 --> 35:53.027
how we looking?

35:54.027 --> 35:55.093
We're fine.

35:55.095 --> 35:56.097
For a month?

35:57.731 --> 35:59.030
No, for the summer at least.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.197
I just...

36:00.199 --> 36:01.800
People, they think you're on TV

36:01.802 --> 36:02.901
and you got it made for life.

36:02.903 --> 36:06.775
Sweety, I really don't
want you getting depressed.

36:07.808 --> 36:08.808
It's not about the money.

36:08.810 --> 36:10.475
I mean I know we need the money
and everything,

36:10.477 --> 36:11.479
but I just...

36:11.812 --> 36:12.948
I like TV, you know?

36:14.614 --> 36:16.047
And TV likes you.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.919
Yeah, for three years.

36:18.953 --> 36:21.990
Oh, should I get you a tissue?

36:24.126 --> 36:26.092
No. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

36:26.094 --> 36:29.528
It's just I like telling stories
and solving mysteries,

36:29.530 --> 36:31.130
entertaining people.

36:31.132 --> 36:33.867
- Yeah.
- And the boys were proud of me.

36:33.869 --> 36:37.006
Baby, the boys will always
be proud of you.

36:39.174 --> 36:40.176
Thanks, Hon.

36:57.027 --> 36:58.695
Yeah, can I help?

37:00.197 --> 37:01.599
You're Roland Masters!

37:02.199 --> 37:03.231
I did a show about you.

37:03.233 --> 37:05.002
I'm a fan of your show.

37:05.536 --> 37:07.235
Of course it wasn't really
accurate, was it?

37:07.237 --> 37:08.603
And those crop formations,

37:08.605 --> 37:10.874
is not what you think.

37:10.876 --> 37:13.243
Well, it's TV, so-

37:13.245 --> 37:14.910
- Yeah, all right.

37:14.912 --> 37:16.215
You mind if I come in?

37:16.948 --> 37:19.885
Yeah. No, please. Yes. Yes.

37:25.090 --> 37:26.092
Here.

37:28.627 --> 37:30.596
Uh, nope.

37:32.931 --> 37:33.933
Sorry.

37:35.067 --> 37:38.235
Yeah, me neither, but I
think the kids might have.

37:38.237 --> 37:39.239
What?

37:39.938 --> 37:42.774
Well, last night's
rib leftovers

37:42.776 --> 37:44.108
were under Ricky's bed.

37:44.110 --> 37:47.013
There was a water dish under
there too.

37:48.247 --> 37:50.314
And when were you going to
tell me this, Hon?

37:50.316 --> 37:52.651
Well, you know how we
had been talking

37:52.653 --> 37:54.722
about getting the kids
a dog.

37:55.188 --> 37:58.156
I was just waiting
for the right moment

37:58.158 --> 38:01.996
to tell you that maybe
they'd already adopted one.

38:02.696 --> 38:04.198
I'm confused though,

38:05.132 --> 38:06.665
why is it your dog?

38:06.667 --> 38:09.003
I mean why is Murphy here?

38:09.670 --> 38:11.871
Well I know he was here.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.075
His recently
reactivated GPS chip

38:15.077 --> 38:16.513
told me he was here.

38:17.012 --> 38:19.079
It actually told Galactatek
he was here,

38:19.081 --> 38:21.217
and then Wilson my robot
told me.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.953
Wilson, his robot.

38:27.188 --> 38:29.591
I'm going to go fetch
the kids.

38:35.198 --> 38:37.600
Would you like a cup
of coffee?

38:46.610 --> 38:48.112
I'm on the freeway now.

38:49.179 --> 38:50.612
I know you're on the freeway,
Jack.

38:50.614 --> 38:52.113
Our eye in the sky is
following you.

38:52.115 --> 38:53.615
Yeah, I'm headed west
towards...

38:53.617 --> 38:55.284
Towards Exit 24. Jack,
and the school.

38:55.286 --> 38:56.288
I know!

38:56.786 --> 38:57.952
Okay, we're going to need to
talk

38:57.954 --> 38:59.121
about what you're going
to do there.

38:59.123 --> 39:00.255
What I'm going to do?

39:00.257 --> 39:01.957
You're gathering Intel.

39:01.959 --> 39:04.828
- Right.
- About?

39:04.830 --> 39:06.696
About the children, Jack.

39:06.698 --> 39:08.797
Children?
What about children?

39:08.799 --> 39:10.966
I thought I was after a dog,
specifically a Jack Russel.

39:10.968 --> 39:13.268
Terrier! Yes, Jack, I know.

39:13.270 --> 39:14.803
Please just listen to me.

39:14.805 --> 39:16.172
Try to stay on point, okay?

39:16.174 --> 39:18.842
You know, you mentioned
something about children,

39:18.844 --> 39:21.012
what if I go check out
the elementary school?

39:21.014 --> 39:23.347
You're on your way to the
school now.

39:23.349 --> 39:24.681
Exit 24!

39:24.683 --> 39:25.849
Can't talk right now,

39:25.851 --> 39:28.087
I'm exiting Exit 24
right now.

39:38.365 --> 39:40.232
Principle Callahan's office.

39:40.234 --> 39:42.234
<i>This is Maurice</i>
in maintenance,

39:42.236 --> 39:43.401
<i>put him on, put him on!</i>

39:43.403 --> 39:45.236
I'm sorry, you'll have to
call back.

39:45.238 --> 39:47.071
He's on the other line and he
has someone from

39:47.073 --> 39:49.107
Galactatek Security waiting.

39:49.109 --> 39:50.409
<i>All right, all right, but you</i>
tell him

39:50.411 --> 39:52.945
<i>the evac pipes are clogging</i>
up again

39:52.947 --> 39:54.447
<i>and it's getting bad down here.</i>

39:54.449 --> 39:55.547
Will do.

39:55.549 --> 39:58.250
<i>Listen, sonny, don't be so</i>
cavalier about this,

39:58.252 --> 40:01.454
<i>if they blow it's not going to</i>
be pretty let me tell ya.

40:01.456 --> 40:03.456
I'll tell him. I'll tell him.

40:03.458 --> 40:05.094
<i>You do that.</i>

40:08.329 --> 40:10.396
Okay, you did
two things wrong.

40:10.398 --> 40:12.800
- <i>What?</i>
- One, is you asked a question,

40:12.802 --> 40:15.169
and two, you asked
another question.

40:15.171 --> 40:16.236
<i>But what if,</i>
what if I...

40:16.238 --> 40:19.138
Listen son, you better get
that term paper in,

40:19.140 --> 40:21.008
or you won't believe what
happens next,

40:21.010 --> 40:22.243
even while it's happening.

40:22.245 --> 40:25.212
<i>Okay, I'll get it</i>
done I promise, I promise.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.348
I'll see you at school
next week.

40:27.350 --> 40:28.352
Bye.

40:31.187 --> 40:32.853
So, let me get this straight,

40:32.855 --> 40:34.989
you're from the
Galatek people,

40:34.991 --> 40:36.857
and you expect me to fall
in line

40:36.859 --> 40:38.327
and answer your questions?

40:38.329 --> 40:41.329
It's Galactatek, one word.

40:41.331 --> 40:43.234
Are you messing
with me now?

40:43.867 --> 40:45.703
Don't get drawn in, Jack.

40:47.204 --> 40:48.903
Let's reset, sir.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.740
I'm just here to ask about
the Hill boys.

40:50.742 --> 40:52.407
Well, they're exemplary
students,

40:52.409 --> 40:53.343
not trouble makers.

40:53.345 --> 40:56.245
What's your interest in the
Hill family?

40:56.247 --> 40:58.515
What's my interest in the
Hill family?

40:58.517 --> 41:00.417
Mom's a real American
sweetheart.

41:00.419 --> 41:03.053
She makes chocolate chip
cookies for the PTA meeting.

41:03.055 --> 41:07.056
- Really?
- No, not really.

41:07.058 --> 41:08.257
I make the cookies.

41:08.259 --> 41:10.461
And I use shortening and not
butter,

41:10.463 --> 41:12.396
and semi-sweet chocolate
chips.

41:12.398 --> 41:14.934
How's that for your gender
stereotyping?

41:15.835 --> 41:16.836
- Tasha?
- What?

41:17.103 --> 41:18.105
You got a tick?

41:18.505 --> 41:19.570
What you got in there?

41:19.572 --> 41:22.942
You running a scam on me, you
glass-jawed punk?

41:24.443 --> 41:25.710
No, sir.

41:25.712 --> 41:28.113
You ever met one of those guys
you shouldn't have messed with?

41:28.115 --> 41:29.450
Well, I'm that guy.

41:29.950 --> 41:32.183
Listen, you ever
come back here,

41:32.185 --> 41:34.453
giving me the third degree
about my kids,

41:34.455 --> 41:37.125
it's going to get real ugly,
real fast.

41:37.424 --> 41:39.024
I think we're done here,
Jack.

41:40.961 --> 41:42.362
Principle Callahan's office.

41:42.364 --> 41:44.463
<i>Get my brother</i>
on the phone.

41:44.465 --> 41:46.465
Principle Callahan
I have your brother Harry

41:46.467 --> 41:48.404
from Frisco on line three.

41:49.538 --> 41:51.407
Tell him, make my day.

41:53.875 --> 41:55.340
Hello inspector,

41:55.342 --> 41:56.476
he is unavailable,

41:56.478 --> 41:58.546
but his message was to
make his...

41:58.548 --> 41:59.479
<i>I know, I know,</i>

41:59.481 --> 42:00.548
<i>make my day.</i>

42:00.550 --> 42:02.515
Our mother always said that
when we were in deep

42:02.517 --> 42:04.053
straights with her.

42:06.923 --> 42:08.091
You still here?

42:11.560 --> 42:13.394
- Boy, he seemed hostile.
- You think?

42:13.396 --> 42:15.429
Listen, I just got a new
reading from the chip,

42:15.431 --> 42:17.599
Murphy's about two miles
from the school.

42:17.601 --> 42:19.134
I'll need an exact fix.

42:19.136 --> 42:20.568
Just get in the car, Jack.

42:20.570 --> 42:22.440
- I'll get you there.
- Copy that.

42:25.474 --> 42:28.476
It's our pipes, they're old
and they need replacing.

42:28.478 --> 42:32.314
Your boss, he's
tough, real tough.

42:32.316 --> 42:34.483
You should meet his brother,
Harry.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.187
Harry Callahan of Frisco?

42:40.224 --> 42:42.026
Got to love it.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.275
<i>I don't know</i>
about this.

42:58.277 --> 42:59.412
<i>I don't know.</i>

43:04.383 --> 43:07.084
Well, there it is.

43:07.086 --> 43:08.389
Yup, there it is.

43:08.622 --> 43:10.988
<i>Yes indeed,</i>
there it most certainly is.

43:10.990 --> 43:11.923
So, you going in, Murph?

43:11.925 --> 43:13.457
<i>Now that I see</i>
it in person

43:13.459 --> 43:14.392
<i>it looks kind of scary.</i>

43:14.394 --> 43:16.628
I thought danger was
your middle name.

43:16.630 --> 43:17.629
Chickening out?

43:17.631 --> 43:19.464
Murphy doesn't chicken out.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.266
<i>I'm no</i>
scaredy-cat,

43:21.268 --> 43:22.935
<i>but I'm occasionally an</i>
apprehensive dog.

43:22.937 --> 43:23.902
But you said you'd...

43:23.904 --> 43:25.304
<i>All right, all right,</i>
I'll do it.

43:25.306 --> 43:26.438
<i>But remember the plan,</i>

43:26.440 --> 43:29.007
<i>if you hear me start to scream</i>
who you gonna call?

43:29.009 --> 43:30.942
We know who to call, Murph.

43:30.944 --> 43:33.145
Okay, this is me
heading over

43:33.147 --> 43:34.613
to the haunted house,

43:34.615 --> 43:37.349
which I know in my mind
isn't really haunted,

43:37.351 --> 43:38.520
at least I hope not.

43:41.056 --> 43:43.055
Besides, it's me Murphy the
Wonder Dog,

43:43.057 --> 43:45.327
and I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

43:47.628 --> 43:49.529
Are you going to answer it?

43:49.531 --> 43:51.535
- It's Dad.
- Don't answer it.

43:53.502 --> 43:55.335
<i>Well, it doesn't look</i>
like there's any way

43:55.337 --> 43:56.270
<i>into the spooky place,</i>
too bad.

43:56.272 --> 43:57.538
<i>Oh, except for that hole,</i>
in the wall.

43:57.540 --> 43:59.406
<i>Darn it!</i>

43:59.408 --> 44:01.878
<i>Got to stick to the plan,</i>
let's go.

44:04.513 --> 44:06.581
I hope he'll be all right.

44:06.583 --> 44:07.682
He'll be fine.

44:07.684 --> 44:09.583
Don't worry, Ricky,

44:09.585 --> 44:11.452
dogs run faster than ghosts.

44:11.454 --> 44:14.391
- How do you know?
- Never watched Scooby-Doo?

44:20.697 --> 44:22.230
Well, I watched your
husband's show.

44:22.232 --> 44:24.600
- You know, he's pretty good.
- Yeah.

44:24.602 --> 44:26.468
How is it that a real-life
cop

44:26.470 --> 44:28.571
winds up being the host
on a TV show?

44:28.573 --> 44:31.240
Well, he was
involved in solving

44:31.242 --> 44:33.142
an alien abduction hoax.

44:33.144 --> 44:36.312
And it was actually
pretty high profile,

44:36.314 --> 44:38.451
do he did a bunch of
TV interviews

44:39.018 --> 44:40.583
and some high mucky-muck
in Hollywood

44:40.585 --> 44:41.585
saw them and thought

44:41.587 --> 44:45.125
that he was going to be a good
fit, you know?

44:46.291 --> 44:47.690
Just one question though,

44:47.692 --> 44:50.296
how sure are you that it
was a hoax?

44:56.303 --> 44:57.338
I mean, what?

44:57.704 --> 44:59.604
Excuse me,

44:59.606 --> 45:00.608
phone call.

45:01.774 --> 45:05.042
Ah, it's Wilson
my robot.

45:05.044 --> 45:06.211
Yeah, Wilson.

45:06.213 --> 45:07.678
<i>Sir, I have</i>
an update.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.348
<i>The dog is less than a</i>
quarter mile

45:09.350 --> 45:11.085
<i>from your current position.</i>

45:11.551 --> 45:13.252
All right, just send me
the directions.

45:13.254 --> 45:14.386
<i>All ready done.</i>

45:14.388 --> 45:17.389
You do know that your attitude
is literally adjustable,

45:17.391 --> 45:19.025
don't you?

45:19.027 --> 45:20.558
<i>If you're going to</i>
talk to me that way,

45:20.560 --> 45:21.696
<i>goodbye, sir.</i>

45:23.230 --> 45:25.031
Well, I have to go and get
my dog.

45:25.033 --> 45:26.035
Uh, huh.

45:27.035 --> 45:28.271
Are you in trouble?

45:29.570 --> 45:31.540
Are my kids going to be safe?

45:33.041 --> 45:33.908
Look,

45:33.910 --> 45:36.575
Murphy is a very smart dog, Mrs.
Hill,

45:36.577 --> 45:38.611
and if he's with your kids
they're going to be

45:38.613 --> 45:39.715
perfectly safe.

45:42.419 --> 45:43.754
Thanks for the coffee.

45:48.824 --> 45:50.424
<i>These kids are</i>
going to get me

45:50.426 --> 45:51.625
<i>in big trouble,</i>

45:51.627 --> 45:54.629
<i>but big trouble is my</i>
mom's middle name.

45:54.631 --> 45:56.730
<i>What's that?</i>
Oh, it's just a noise.

45:56.732 --> 45:59.635
<i>A noise from down there,</i>
from the basement.

45:59.637 --> 46:02.671
<i>From the creepy, crawly,</i>
ultra-dark, spider-filled,

46:02.673 --> 46:05.474
<i>bat-infested basement!</i>

46:05.476 --> 46:06.644
<i>No fear! No fear!</i>

46:07.344 --> 46:08.345
<i>No fear!</i>

46:12.615 --> 46:15.153
David, Ricky, you guys
up there?

46:15.352 --> 46:16.819
They're not here, Mr. Hill.

46:16.821 --> 46:18.855
Oh, hey Shelton, I figured

46:18.857 --> 46:20.156
that they would've been here.

46:20.158 --> 46:21.723
Do you know where they are?

46:21.725 --> 46:22.526
Ummmm.

46:23.662 --> 46:24.828
Come on, that's a pretty easy
question

46:24.830 --> 46:26.663
for a smart kid like you.

46:26.665 --> 46:28.667
They didn't want me to say.

46:29.802 --> 46:31.668
Let me take a wild guess,

46:31.670 --> 46:34.240
are they at the old
Connejo house?

46:36.708 --> 46:38.742
- I appreciate your candor.
- Yes, sir.

46:38.744 --> 46:41.711
Oh, hey, Shelton, let me
ask you another question,

46:41.713 --> 46:43.680
how the heck do you get Wi-Fi
all the way out here

46:43.682 --> 46:45.553
in the middle of nowhere?

46:47.220 --> 46:48.622
Who, me?

46:49.756 --> 46:50.622
That's what I thought.

46:50.624 --> 46:51.689
Tell Ricky and David I'm
looking for them

46:51.691 --> 46:52.723
if you see them.

46:52.725 --> 46:54.061
Yes, Mr. Hill.

46:54.560 --> 46:56.363
Man, they're going to get it.

47:00.433 --> 47:01.766
<i>Man, what's all</i>
that racket?

47:01.768 --> 47:03.268
<i>Hey, wait a minute,</i>
ghosts don't

47:03.270 --> 47:04.605
<i>operate machinery.</i>

47:07.442 --> 47:10.445
<i>Maybe I should wait until</i>
their lunch break.

47:11.311 --> 47:13.778
<i>Wait just a cotton-pickin',</i>
ghost-pickin', minute.

47:13.780 --> 47:15.514
<i>That doesn't reek of</i>
ectoplasm,

47:15.516 --> 47:17.653
<i>that smells like Robeks.</i>

47:20.756 --> 47:22.658
Been a while now, hasn't it?

47:22.925 --> 47:24.924
Yeah, I hope he'll
be all right.

47:24.926 --> 47:25.926
Should we go in and
check on him?

47:25.928 --> 47:27.761
Give him a few more minutes
and then we'll

47:27.763 --> 47:28.928
all go and take a look.

47:28.930 --> 47:30.229
Can't wait!

47:30.231 --> 47:31.867
Creepy aliens, talking dog.

47:42.746 --> 47:45.380
<i>Ah, no evil spirits</i>
in this dump,

47:45.382 --> 47:47.181
Hey, thanks for picking
up the drinks, buddy,

47:47.183 --> 47:48.382
came in handy.

47:48.384 --> 47:49.852
<i>It's just a couple</i>
of clowns.

47:49.854 --> 47:51.820
Better than coffee, pal.

47:51.822 --> 47:53.388
And I really feel like it's
given me

47:53.390 --> 47:55.193
the extra energy boost
we needed.

47:55.825 --> 47:57.258
Why you talking like that?

47:57.260 --> 47:58.260
I don't know.

47:58.262 --> 47:59.597
It just felt right.

48:00.631 --> 48:02.397
So does this tasty beverage.

48:02.399 --> 48:03.599
<i>Wait a minute,</i>

48:03.601 --> 48:04.800
<i>they're putting on an act,</i>

48:04.802 --> 48:06.235
<i>scaring everybody away.</i>

48:08.406 --> 48:09.572
Hey, that mangy mutt
got in here.

48:09.574 --> 48:11.440
Let's get him before his
owner comes looking for him.

48:11.442 --> 48:12.444
Ow!

48:19.317 --> 48:20.585
Go, go, get him!

48:27.760 --> 48:29.763
<i>This will</i>
fix 'em!

48:32.664 --> 48:33.867
What's he doing?

48:35.367 --> 48:36.369
Oh no, no, no!

48:37.538 --> 48:39.705
No, no, no, no!

48:39.707 --> 48:40.806
<i>There's a shoe!</i>

48:40.808 --> 48:43.841
<i>Gazoontite.</i>

48:49.883 --> 48:51.718
<i>I'm out of here.</i>

48:54.956 --> 48:56.892
It hurts, it hurts!

49:05.532 --> 49:08.836
<i>Now here's some good</i>
slapstick potential.

49:11.573 --> 49:12.575
<i>I can't watch!</i>

49:12.841 --> 49:13.843
Go get him!

49:23.785 --> 49:25.887
- Is that a ghost?
- Get a grip.

49:25.889 --> 49:27.021
I know it's a haunted house

49:27.023 --> 49:29.594
but we're looking for
aliens here.

49:34.931 --> 49:36.900
Adios, suckers.

49:42.906 --> 49:44.073
Oh, that wasn't so bad.

49:44.075 --> 49:45.607
Says you, you jerk!

49:45.609 --> 49:46.741
Let's get him!

49:46.743 --> 49:48.914
Come on, come on,
let's get him!

49:51.316 --> 49:52.651
Someone's coming.

50:07.665 --> 50:08.667
Gotcha.

50:12.003 --> 50:12.936
Who are you?

50:12.938 --> 50:15.539
Jack Bowser, private security
operative.

50:15.541 --> 50:16.973
That sounds ludicrous.

50:16.975 --> 50:18.175
<i>It does, Jack.</i>

50:18.177 --> 50:20.678
Could you once let me do this
without yacking in my ear?

50:20.680 --> 50:21.979
Who's in your ear?

50:21.981 --> 50:23.714
The most annoying person
in the world.

50:23.716 --> 50:26.854
Now, I'm taking this dog,
any problem with that?

50:27.519 --> 50:28.989
You're not here for us?

50:29.422 --> 50:30.424
You?

50:30.857 --> 50:31.859
No.

50:32.525 --> 50:34.025
So then, we're...

50:34.027 --> 50:34.828
Free to go?

50:35.763 --> 50:36.694
Well, you could stay here
if you want,

50:36.696 --> 50:38.599
but I wouldn't.

50:47.776 --> 50:50.713
Hey, he's taking Murphy!

50:55.650 --> 50:57.419
What are we going to do?

51:04.893 --> 51:06.594
What the what?

51:06.596 --> 51:08.763
Suddenly it's Grand Central
over there.

51:08.765 --> 51:10.063
Come on, let's go down there,

51:10.065 --> 51:11.766
maybe they can tell us
what happened.

51:11.768 --> 51:14.438
I look forward to our
Amber Alerts.

51:19.842 --> 51:22.943
Don't worry buddy, I'm not
going to hurt you.

51:22.945 --> 51:24.979
You're a tough little guy
to get a hold of,

51:24.981 --> 51:26.947
they've been looking for you
for six years.

51:26.949 --> 51:29.818
Hey, you hungry?
Thirsty?

51:29.820 --> 51:31.887
He's talking to the dog?

51:31.889 --> 51:33.991
Should have brought some
bacon.

51:35.493 --> 51:36.658
You know what, there's a
strip mall

51:36.660 --> 51:37.759
a couple of miles up,

51:37.761 --> 51:40.495
what do you say I stop and get
you some water, huh?

51:40.497 --> 51:41.998
<i>Some big spender</i>
you are!

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
<i>How about a mochaccino,</i>
Cappuccino,

51:44.002 --> 51:45.003
<i>extra syrup, Latte?</i>

51:46.004 --> 51:48.738
You're thinking at me,
that's cool.

51:48.740 --> 51:51.441
Wow, you're the first
one to get that right.

51:51.443 --> 51:53.947
And now he thinks
it's answering.

51:55.914 --> 51:56.914
Oh boy.

51:57.784 --> 52:00.016
Hey, you must
be really smart.

52:00.018 --> 52:01.020
I like you!

52:01.887 --> 52:03.052
Like you too, buddy.

52:03.054 --> 52:05.189
So, you're the owner
of Murphy?

52:05.191 --> 52:06.790
That I am, and I'm afraid

52:06.792 --> 52:10.028
he's in the clutches of
the Galactatek corporation now.

52:10.030 --> 52:11.196
I mean he's cute and all,

52:11.198 --> 52:13.064
but what would a multinational

52:13.066 --> 52:14.966
research and technology
conglomerate

52:14.968 --> 52:17.901
want with a dog, cute
or not?

52:17.903 --> 52:19.069
You getting this?

52:19.071 --> 52:20.104
Not a word.

52:20.106 --> 52:24.076
They don't want Murphy,
they want his brain.

52:25.512 --> 52:27.980
- Uh-oh.
- I think you'd better explain.

52:27.982 --> 52:31.016
Well, you've heard stories of
downed UFOs,

52:31.018 --> 52:34.987
and flying saucers that crashed
and wound up in Area 51, right?

52:34.989 --> 52:36.993
Well, none of that's true.

52:37.492 --> 52:38.792
I thought so.

52:38.794 --> 52:39.859
See the Galactatek Corporation

52:39.861 --> 52:43.696
had a contract on all that
alien stuff decades ago.

52:43.698 --> 52:45.934
Area 51, that was just a
coverup.

52:46.635 --> 52:47.700
Oh.

52:47.702 --> 52:49.669
We worked the Roswell remains,

52:49.671 --> 52:51.571
reverse engineering everything
from

52:51.573 --> 52:53.674
alien micro-technology to

52:53.676 --> 52:56.844
complex chemical and biological
interfaces.

52:56.846 --> 52:59.650
The aliens had created living
computers.

53:00.783 --> 53:01.782
I knew it.

53:01.784 --> 53:03.520
Shh, he's flashbacking.

53:04.254 --> 53:07.121
And we knew that amazing
information,

53:07.123 --> 53:08.255
the secrets of the universe,

53:08.257 --> 53:09.291
of life itself,

53:09.293 --> 53:10.791
were all locked

53:10.793 --> 53:13.794
inside this bizarre
biotech computer.

53:13.796 --> 53:16.999
But all we had were rudimentary
means to communicate.

53:17.001 --> 53:22.004
But then I found an inert
gene from an alien DNA matrix,

53:22.006 --> 53:23.171
So what'd you do
with it?

53:23.173 --> 53:25.842
Well, I did what anyone
would do,

53:25.844 --> 53:27.746
I implanted it into a puppy.

53:28.178 --> 53:29.147
Eww.

53:29.714 --> 53:30.647
Say what now?

53:30.649 --> 53:32.848
Sounds a bit Frankensteiny
doesn't it,

53:32.850 --> 53:34.884
and maybe just a
little bit nuts,

53:34.886 --> 53:36.920
but it worked!

53:36.922 --> 53:41.157
And this little dog was
suddenly blessed with these

53:41.159 --> 53:46.030
supernatural intelligence
that well, even exceeded

53:46.032 --> 53:47.197
my expectations.

53:47.199 --> 53:49.802
It took a smart dog to outfox
us.

53:50.570 --> 53:53.570
But when the CEO, Crowder,

53:53.572 --> 53:55.271
got wind of what I did,

53:55.273 --> 53:56.742
he smelled money.

53:57.243 --> 53:59.578
I couldn't bear to think of
what they might do to

53:59.580 --> 54:01.915
Murphy inside those
labs of his,

54:03.649 --> 54:04.618
so I took him.

54:05.486 --> 54:08.089
Well, that is quite a story,
Doctor.

54:09.656 --> 54:11.122
Dad, how long have
you been here?

54:11.124 --> 54:12.390
Long enough.

54:12.392 --> 54:16.597
David, Ricky, what did I tell
you about coming out here alone?

54:16.965 --> 54:18.700
- Run along home.
- Okay, Dad.

54:20.268 --> 54:23.101
Okay, when we walk by the
old guy, make a diversion.

54:23.103 --> 54:23.970
What?

54:23.972 --> 54:26.072
Distract him or do something
cute.

54:26.074 --> 54:28.010
- Why?
- Just do it.

54:30.144 --> 54:32.147
I liked your story, mister.

54:32.615 --> 54:34.080
Well thanks, pal, that
means a lot.

54:34.082 --> 54:37.153
Jeremy, Jenny, you too.

54:39.020 --> 54:41.124
Yes, Mr. Hill.

54:43.124 --> 54:44.327
And who are you two?

54:45.061 --> 54:46.728
We're realtors.

54:46.730 --> 54:48.362
Yeah, yeah, we're thinking
about

54:48.364 --> 54:51.132
fixing the place up and
flipping it.

54:51.134 --> 54:52.733
Well, I wish you luck.

54:52.735 --> 54:54.137
And as for you, Doctor...

54:56.672 --> 54:58.005
Whoa, where'd he go?

54:58.007 --> 54:59.877
Whoa, he was right there.

55:02.046 --> 55:03.379
Hey, you look familiar,

55:03.381 --> 55:05.180
I've seen you somewhere before.

55:05.182 --> 55:06.881
Detective Steven Hill.

55:06.883 --> 55:07.684
Detective?

55:08.385 --> 55:11.319
Hey, you're that guy on TV,
right?

55:11.321 --> 55:13.722
The guy with all those crazy
mysteries?

55:13.724 --> 55:15.059
That's me.

55:15.892 --> 55:18.895
Hey, do you think anything
the Doc said was legit?

55:18.897 --> 55:22.364
I don't know, that's why
we call them, unresolved.

55:22.366 --> 55:24.102
Because it's unresolved!

55:25.203 --> 55:27.206
Oh, oh!

55:28.072 --> 55:29.739
What do you think he means,
dummy?

55:29.741 --> 55:31.306
He means it's not resolved,

55:31.308 --> 55:32.912
Not resolved, right.

55:33.211 --> 55:34.380
Good luck, guys.

55:35.081 --> 55:37.117
Yeah, hey, nice meeting you.

55:38.251 --> 55:41.088
Wow, the guy's on TV.

56:01.274 --> 56:03.808
<i>And that's how it</i>
all went down, I swear.

56:03.810 --> 56:06.311
<i>It was the scariest night</i>
of my life.

56:06.313 --> 56:09.015
<i>And that includes that</i>
hamburger incident in Barstow.

56:09.017 --> 56:10.316
<i>But I digress.</i>

56:10.318 --> 56:13.885
<i>Anyway, this old man found me</i>
as soon as Doctor Masters left,

56:13.887 --> 56:15.023
<i>I was so lucky!</i>

56:15.490 --> 56:16.692
Gotcha.

56:19.927 --> 56:21.064
Oh yeah, I know,

56:22.165 --> 56:25.701
those flying machines
buzzing around all the time.

56:26.401 --> 56:29.071
Fella, you're shaking
like a leaf.

56:34.910 --> 56:36.945
<i>He took me</i>
to his cabin in the woods,

56:36.947 --> 56:38.213
<i>not far from here.</i>

56:38.215 --> 56:40.380
<i>And I was under their noses</i>
the whole time.

56:40.382 --> 56:42.249
<i>But the old man knew</i>
his stuff,

56:42.251 --> 56:43.418
<i>maybe he'd even worked for</i>

56:43.420 --> 56:45.253
<i>Galactatek at one time,</i>
or something.

56:45.255 --> 56:48.757
<i>Anyway, he knew how to block</i>
my GPS signal,

56:48.759 --> 56:52.761
<i>and then one day he just</i>
stopped coming home

56:52.763 --> 56:54.165
<i>and I was all alone.</i>

56:55.232 --> 56:57.098
<i>You're going to lock me up,</i>
aren't you?

56:57.100 --> 56:58.269
Look, it's not me,

56:59.236 --> 57:01.238
I was assigned to find a dog,

57:01.805 --> 57:03.272
I didn't realize the dog was
going to turn out

57:03.274 --> 57:04.272
to be such a great guy.

57:04.274 --> 57:06.944
<i>Well,</i>
thanks for that.

57:12.985 --> 57:14.351
Jack's here with the dog, sir.

57:14.353 --> 57:16.452
I think he may need a
vacation, sir.

57:16.454 --> 57:18.355
He's talking to the dog,

57:18.357 --> 57:21.291
And he thinks the dog
is talking back to him.

57:21.293 --> 57:23.360
I need the dog
back in the lab,

57:23.362 --> 57:25.332
don't let anything go wrong.

57:27.066 --> 57:29.502
Was the talking dog not
news to you?

57:40.079 --> 57:41.512
What you looking for?

57:41.514 --> 57:44.049
I'll tell you when I find it.

57:44.051 --> 57:45.050
Can I help?

57:45.052 --> 57:47.386
I know exactly where it is.

57:47.388 --> 57:48.389
Where what is?

57:53.927 --> 57:54.929
This!

57:55.261 --> 57:56.360
What's that?

57:56.362 --> 57:58.231
Well, it's an old telephone
called a land line.

57:58.233 --> 57:59.198
Why?

57:59.200 --> 58:00.899
Who knows, but if you plug
it into the wall

58:00.901 --> 58:02.535
it works just like your cell.

58:02.537 --> 58:03.937
How do you know that?

58:03.939 --> 58:05.405
I saw it in an old movie.

58:05.407 --> 58:07.073
Why don't you just
use your cell?

58:07.075 --> 58:08.408
Because I dropped it in
the doctor's pocket

58:08.410 --> 58:10.176
right before Dad sent us
home today.

58:10.178 --> 58:12.010
Dad's not going to like this.

58:12.012 --> 58:13.783
Trust me, it will work.

58:32.468 --> 58:33.434
- Hello?
- Hello Doctor,

58:33.436 --> 58:34.336
this is David Hill.

58:34.338 --> 58:37.004
David, you know this isn't
my phone.

58:37.006 --> 58:38.606
Yeah, I hid it in your
jacket.

58:38.608 --> 58:40.175
What would make you
do something like that?

58:40.177 --> 58:42.010
Because the gang and I
are going to help you

58:42.012 --> 58:43.178
get your dog back.

58:43.180 --> 58:44.211
No, no, hold on, David,

58:44.213 --> 58:45.882
that would be very unwise.

58:45.884 --> 58:47.183
Yeah, that's why
we called you.

58:47.185 --> 58:48.183
Because you worked for
Galactatek

58:48.185 --> 58:50.185
for such a long time, maybe you
could help us

58:50.187 --> 58:52.388
get on the base without setting
off any of the alarms.

58:52.390 --> 58:54.259
Hold on, let me think.

58:57.527 --> 58:58.529
Why not?

58:59.364 --> 59:01.264
All right, all right,

59:01.266 --> 59:02.398
I think I have a plan.

59:02.400 --> 59:04.436
Great, we start tomorrow.

59:08.240 --> 59:09.305
What a day!

59:09.307 --> 59:11.073
Do you think we have to
worry about those kids?

59:11.075 --> 59:13.110
Na, they'd never sell us out.

59:13.112 --> 59:14.414
No, but I might.

59:14.914 --> 59:16.280
What are you doing here?

59:16.282 --> 59:18.382
Well, I was hoping to ask a
small favor

59:18.384 --> 59:20.118
of you two gentlemen.

59:20.120 --> 59:22.185
What do you mean by, favor?

59:22.187 --> 59:23.687
It's the kind of favor that
will allow you

59:23.689 --> 59:27.091
to keep your licit business
flourishing,

59:27.093 --> 59:29.259
as well as helping me
get back my dog.

59:29.261 --> 59:30.928
Do we have a choice?

59:30.930 --> 59:34.400
Not if you want to keep
selling these silly sneakers.

59:34.402 --> 59:36.137
Hey, what do you mean by...

59:36.971 --> 59:37.769
What do we have to do?

59:37.771 --> 59:39.405
Well, I need a couple
of aliens,

59:39.407 --> 59:41.106
and, uh,

59:41.108 --> 59:43.144
I'd say you boys fit that bill.

59:57.959 --> 59:59.459
How come Masters is sitting
safe and sound

59:59.461 --> 01:00:00.359
back at the clubhouse

01:00:00.361 --> 01:00:02.127
while we're out here
risking our necks.

01:00:02.129 --> 01:00:03.296
I don't know.

01:00:04.332 --> 01:00:06.502
Oh, shh, be quiet,
that's him.

01:00:08.704 --> 01:00:10.003
Hello?

01:00:10.005 --> 01:00:11.005
Status?

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.206
Status?

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.708
Check this guy out,
he thinks

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.543
he thinks he's on an episode
of 24.

01:00:16.545 --> 01:00:18.545
We like more like we're from
the Outer Limits.

01:00:19.514 --> 01:00:20.682
Status...

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:21.682
quo.

01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:26.655
- Well, how are the kids?
- Oh, oh, the kids?

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:28.222
Yeah, they're fine.

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:29.660
Not a peep out of them.

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:34.763
Remember what I told you
to say

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:36.565
when you get to that gate.

01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:37.534
Yeah, I remember.

01:00:37.536 --> 01:00:38.601
Hey, what do you think
you're dealing with,

01:00:38.603 --> 01:00:39.938
a couple idiots here?

01:00:44.576 --> 01:00:45.377
Hello?

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:47.712
Hello?

01:00:58.124 --> 01:00:59.125
Got 'em!

01:00:59.592 --> 01:01:01.394
Just southwest of
Rock Ditch

01:01:02.293 --> 01:01:03.963
heading towards Chainsaw.

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:06.463
I think we're slowing down.

01:01:06.465 --> 01:01:08.168
Yeah, this could be it.

01:01:08.634 --> 01:01:09.567
Everyone ready?

01:01:09.569 --> 01:01:11.636
I'm like lunch meat,
I'm always ready.

01:01:11.638 --> 01:01:14.138
- Lunch meat's gross.
- You're gross.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.141
Stop bickering!

01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:17.775
Hey, that's my line!

01:01:17.777 --> 01:01:19.511
And I didn't understand it
then either.

01:01:19.513 --> 01:01:21.215
Shh, we're stopping.

01:01:30.324 --> 01:01:31.693
What have we got here?

01:01:37.398 --> 01:01:40.198
Rosswell's about 100 miles
that way.

01:01:42.504 --> 01:01:43.469
Funny.

01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:46.073
We're here for Doctor
Suberon's birthday.

01:01:46.075 --> 01:01:48.611
You don't seem to be on
our list.

01:01:50.379 --> 01:01:52.047
You don't have a list.

01:01:52.714 --> 01:01:54.547
Well, call him up,
they've been

01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:56.116
planning this thing for weeks.

01:01:56.118 --> 01:01:58.586
Joe, call Lab 7, see if
Suberon's

01:01:58.588 --> 01:01:59.787
throwing a party today.

01:01:59.789 --> 01:02:03.124
You got an X143 going on
up there?

01:02:03.126 --> 01:02:05.325
We got a pair of rental crabs
here at the gate.

01:02:05.327 --> 01:02:07.628
They say they're here for
Suberon's party.

01:02:21.111 --> 01:02:22.479
Watch this!

01:02:25.682 --> 01:02:28.586
<i>Confirmation, party on</i>
schedule at 14:30.

01:02:29.353 --> 01:02:32.524
It's okay, Suberon's party
starts in 15 minutes.

01:02:33.858 --> 01:02:36.326
Well it looks like you guys
are clear to go.

01:02:36.328 --> 01:02:38.193
You know where you're going?

01:02:38.195 --> 01:02:39.197
Lab 7.

01:02:41.366 --> 01:02:42.668
Lab 7.

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:47.173
Hey, and no sightseeing.

01:02:48.707 --> 01:02:51.642
Tell birthday boy to
bring down some cake.

01:02:51.644 --> 01:02:52.646
Will do.

01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:00.388
I'm watching you.

01:03:08.862 --> 01:03:10.231
Go.

01:03:11.464 --> 01:03:12.600
Go.

01:03:26.414 --> 01:03:27.549
Mmm.

01:03:28.448 --> 01:03:29.885
Alien clowns.

01:03:31.452 --> 01:03:32.721
I don't like crabs.

01:03:48.671 --> 01:03:50.474
All ashore who's
coming to ashore.

01:04:00.517 --> 01:04:03.517
Okay Doc, we're over by Lab 7.
What now?

01:04:03.519 --> 01:04:05.987
Well now, it's an
educated guess...

01:04:05.989 --> 01:04:07.489
Educated guess?

01:04:07.491 --> 01:04:09.658
A highly educated guess.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:10.658
They're going to have Murphy
in quarantine

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.828
in a small room on the
other side of the lab.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:14.663
Now, you're not going to have
access to that,

01:04:14.665 --> 01:04:15.998
so you're going to have to
walk through

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.433
Lab 7 to Ge there.

01:04:17.435 --> 01:04:18.567
So, how do we get in there?

01:04:18.569 --> 01:04:21.338
Once you find the access door
just punch in the code

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.572
that I gave you last night,
remember?

01:04:23.574 --> 01:04:25.842
Oh, yeah, just like that,
huh?

01:04:25.844 --> 01:04:28.878
Four kids and a couple of
nut job aliens just saunter in.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.746
Real easy.

01:04:29.748 --> 01:04:31.548
Look, look, people are
used to seeing

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:32.749
weird things around that place,
okay?

01:04:32.751 --> 01:04:35.718
Just stay calm and walk
quickly.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.721
You mean run?

01:04:36.723 --> 01:04:37.721
No! No! No!

01:04:37.723 --> 01:04:38.656
Do not run!

01:04:38.658 --> 01:04:43.393
Just don't stop to
gawk at anything, okay?

01:04:43.395 --> 01:04:44.765
All right, got it.

01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:50.433
Okay, stick together,
keep your eyes forward,

01:04:50.435 --> 01:04:51.768
and no talking.

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:53.905
- Right.
- This is kind of cool.

01:04:53.907 --> 01:04:56.307
It's just like one of
Dad's shows.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:57.275
Whatever.

01:04:57.277 --> 01:04:59.844
Do all of you have to
have the last word?

01:04:59.846 --> 01:05:02.983
Wait, does anybody need
to go to the bathroom?

01:05:07.788 --> 01:05:08.790
Not you!

01:05:10.457 --> 01:05:14.963
All right, follow us and
try not to look like kids.

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:16.995
Come on.

01:05:16.997 --> 01:05:18.631
How are we going to do that?

01:05:18.633 --> 01:05:20.799
Attitude, Ricky, attitude.

01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:22.801
I bet ya she's real fun
on a camping trip.

01:05:22.803 --> 01:05:24.037
No kidding!

01:05:24.039 --> 01:05:25.706
<i>Hey, my canine</i>
intuition

01:05:25.708 --> 01:05:27.808
<i>tells me there's a rescue</i>
attempt in the making.

01:05:54.905 --> 01:05:57.773
All I can say is, whoa!

01:05:57.775 --> 01:05:59.442
Double whoa!

01:05:59.444 --> 01:06:01.043
Make it a triple.

01:06:01.045 --> 01:06:03.782
No one's ever going to
believe us.

01:06:05.917 --> 01:06:08.786
This is like the room
I always wanted.

01:06:14.592 --> 01:06:16.492
<i>It's the kids,</i>
I know it.

01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:18.430
<i>Come on guys, you can do it.</i>

01:06:25.637 --> 01:06:26.839
Do you hear talking?

01:06:33.513 --> 01:06:35.812
Do you think they're
talking about us?

01:06:35.814 --> 01:06:37.080
Wouldn't you?

01:06:37.082 --> 01:06:39.952
Yeah, because to them
we're the aliens.

01:06:40.786 --> 01:06:43.924
I don't care what they're
saying about us.

01:06:46.626 --> 01:06:49.093
Come on, we have to
find that dog.

01:06:49.095 --> 01:06:52.499
Right, because I'm boiling
in this costume.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:57.735
I think they're
getting close.

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.402
He's over there.

01:07:29.605 --> 01:07:33.477
Hey, did you see
a giant crab man just now?

01:07:38.582 --> 01:07:39.915
There's a couple of guards
between us and the lab.

01:07:39.917 --> 01:07:41.883
They don't look as dumb
as the ones up at the gate.

01:07:41.885 --> 01:07:45.453
That was some plan your pal
the Doc had, kids.

01:07:45.455 --> 01:07:47.455
- We should bale.
- Yeah.

01:07:47.457 --> 01:07:49.627
We can't get Murphy?

01:08:02.639 --> 01:08:05.845
You ready to do something
good for a change, pal?

01:08:07.879 --> 01:08:10.046
All right, Freddy and I are
going to distract the guards

01:08:10.048 --> 01:08:11.481
and get them away from
their posts.

01:08:11.483 --> 01:08:12.816
And if the guards
take the bait

01:08:12.818 --> 01:08:14.484
you kids run in there
as fast as you can

01:08:14.486 --> 01:08:16.118
and get the mutt and
get out of there.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.554
How do we get away?

01:08:17.555 --> 01:08:18.921
We can't drive.

01:08:18.923 --> 01:08:20.828
Oh yeah, uh...

01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:23.862
make your way to the truck,
we'll meet you there.

01:08:23.863 --> 01:08:25.863
Why should we trust you?

01:08:25.865 --> 01:08:27.533
Give us a chance, kid.

01:08:33.874 --> 01:08:34.875
All right,

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:36.611
on three.

01:08:39.546 --> 01:08:40.448
Three!

01:08:41.549 --> 01:08:44.048
Take us to your leader!

01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:46.584
We're here to subdue
your world.

01:08:46.586 --> 01:08:48.921
Yes, earth shall ours.

01:08:49.956 --> 01:08:51.590
Hey, what's the gag?

01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:53.093
What are you guys doing here?

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.593
This is a secured area.

01:08:54.595 --> 01:08:58.596
We don't care,
we are invaders from Mars.

01:08:58.599 --> 01:09:01.234
Okay, wait a minute,
let's see your badges.

01:09:01.236 --> 01:09:03.236
Uh, our badges?

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:06.305
We must have left those in our
other alien costumes,

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.606
the ones with the pockets.

01:09:07.608 --> 01:09:10.243
All right, that's it wiseguy,

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:13.113
here, now!

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.115
Uh, run!

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:15.282
Hey, they're getting away,

01:09:15.283 --> 01:09:16.850
hit the alarm button now!

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:17.854
Get them!

01:09:24.962 --> 01:09:27.031
Murphy!

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:40.678
<i>All security doors</i>
will be closed in 60 seconds.

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:43.746
Go!

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:45.017
Come on. Come on.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:50.054
<i>All personnel</i>
report to your designated posts.

01:09:53.191 --> 01:09:54.623
<i>I knew you</i>
guys were coming.

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:55.792
<i>Is the Doc with you?</i>

01:09:55.794 --> 01:09:58.262
No, but we're taking you
to him as soon as possible.

01:09:58.264 --> 01:10:00.734
I need something to hide you in.

01:10:03.068 --> 01:10:04.935
- What's he doing?
- I get it.

01:10:04.937 --> 01:10:05.939
Great!

01:10:07.607 --> 01:10:09.042
This will have to do.

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:12.813
<i>A backpack,</i>
are we going to college?

01:10:16.116 --> 01:10:19.116
Oh no, a security alarm
just went off at Galactatek.

01:10:19.118 --> 01:10:20.151
How do you know this?

01:10:20.153 --> 01:10:22.690
Because I hacked
their system.

01:10:23.756 --> 01:10:24.990
I think the NSA is going to

01:10:24.992 --> 01:10:26.324
wanna have a talk with you, son.

01:10:26.326 --> 01:10:27.392
I can find out.

01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:30.132
No, no, not needed, kid.

01:10:31.999 --> 01:10:35.166
<i>All security doors</i>
are now closed.

01:10:35.168 --> 01:10:36.234
They're not here.

01:10:36.236 --> 01:10:38.304
Nice plan, minus the
getaway.

01:10:38.306 --> 01:10:40.406
Don't worry, I know how
to get out of here.

01:10:40.408 --> 01:10:41.974
Care to share, smart guy?

01:10:41.976 --> 01:10:43.142
<i>What do you got</i>
lined up?

01:10:43.144 --> 01:10:44.810
<i>Tell me you got a limo.</i>

01:10:44.812 --> 01:10:45.878
Not really.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880
- <i>Taxi?</i>
- Nope.

01:10:46.882 --> 01:10:48.281
<i>Look, I'll settle</i>
for a rickshaw,

01:10:48.283 --> 01:10:49.882
<i>but that's as low as I go.</i>

01:10:49.884 --> 01:10:52.653
None of the above,
we're going sky surfing.

01:10:52.655 --> 01:10:54.054
Sky surfing?

01:10:54.056 --> 01:10:55.721
You mean like
surfing on nothing?

01:10:55.723 --> 01:10:58.058
Yeah, it's the only way
to get you out of here, Murph.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.225
Come on, follow me.

01:10:59.227 --> 01:11:01.328
<i>I don't think</i>
I'm down for surfing on nothing.

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:03.297
<i>Guys, wait, let's</i>
talk about this.

01:11:03.299 --> 01:11:04.100
<i>Stop!</i>

01:11:05.067 --> 01:11:07.200
All right, come on,
get in there!

01:11:07.202 --> 01:11:08.735
Get in there both of you!

01:11:08.737 --> 01:11:11.239
Look at you two crabs.

01:11:11.241 --> 01:11:12.239
Want some sushi?

01:11:12.241 --> 01:11:13.708
I'm just joking with them,

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:15.342
they got to move their
claws like that.

01:11:15.344 --> 01:11:17.945
Hey, something smells fishy,

01:11:17.947 --> 01:11:19.048
don't you think?

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:20.048
It smells fishy!

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:23.252
Okay, we'll leave these two guys
the octopuses.

01:11:23.254 --> 01:11:24.186
All right,

01:11:24.188 --> 01:11:25.219
don't clam up.

01:11:25.221 --> 01:11:26.254
You hear what I did there?

01:11:26.256 --> 01:11:27.356
I said, clam.

01:11:27.358 --> 01:11:28.627
I said, clam up.

01:11:31.095 --> 01:11:33.129
Looks like the kids
swiped the dog.

01:11:33.131 --> 01:11:35.098
Yeah, but how are they going
to get out of this

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.232
dystopian nightmare?

01:11:37.234 --> 01:11:38.968
Dystopian nightmare?

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:40.773
Don't over sell it, buddy.

01:11:41.972 --> 01:11:43.242
That's our way out.

01:11:44.275 --> 01:11:45.774
Do you think we can fly them?

01:11:45.776 --> 01:11:46.976
We're going to have to.

01:11:46.978 --> 01:11:48.813
<i>Is that the</i>
only option?

01:11:48.815 --> 01:11:50.116
<i>How about a plan B?</i>

01:11:50.949 --> 01:11:51.815
We don't have time Murph,

01:11:51.817 --> 01:11:53.951
do you want to see
Doc Masters again?

01:11:53.953 --> 01:11:55.452
<i>Uh, is that a trick</i>
question?

01:11:55.454 --> 01:11:57.957
<i>And do we have flight</i>
insurance?

01:12:00.293 --> 01:12:03.330
<i>Galactatek is now</i>
in lockdown.

01:12:03.964 --> 01:12:05.262
- What's going on?
- They got the dog!

01:12:05.264 --> 01:12:06.267
What? How?

01:12:06.967 --> 01:12:08.803
Forget it, just get it back!

01:12:12.004 --> 01:12:14.239
<i>Sled activated,</i>
ready for command.

01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:16.006
I just need this thing to fly.

01:12:16.008 --> 01:12:18.209
<i>Affirmative,</i>
prepare for liftoff.

01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:20.148
Oh boy, oh boy, it's working.

01:12:27.188 --> 01:12:29.254
<i>Ready for motion</i>
direction.

01:12:29.256 --> 01:12:30.123
Forward!

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:32.491
<i>Forward, manual</i>
control.

01:12:32.493 --> 01:12:35.197
<i>I guess we're</i>
doing this.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.433
Come on guys, it's easy.

01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:41.200
<i>Easy, that's easy</i>
for you,

01:12:41.202 --> 01:12:42.971
<i>you're not looking down.</i>

01:12:46.242 --> 01:12:48.411
<i>Prepare</i>
for liftoff.

01:12:49.545 --> 01:12:50.747
Whoa!

01:12:53.216 --> 01:12:54.218
Whoa!

01:12:58.021 --> 01:13:01.124
Whoa, this thing has
a mind of its own.

01:13:07.329 --> 01:13:10.198
Do you think our parents
will let us keep these?

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.137
Sure, they'll let us fly them
to school.

01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:15.139
What was he thinking?

01:13:17.874 --> 01:13:19.274
<i>Warning,</i>

<i>Uh-oh.</i>

01:13:23.481 --> 01:13:26.152
<i>It is now</i>
quite close.

01:13:27.318 --> 01:13:30.186
<i>Who's got the</i>
garage opener?

01:13:30.188 --> 01:13:33.155
Watch out David, watch
the wall!

01:13:33.157 --> 01:13:34.824
Well, what do I do?
What do I do?

01:13:34.826 --> 01:13:36.896
<i>Why are you</i>
asking me, I'm dog.

01:13:38.563 --> 01:13:40.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:13:40.032 --> 01:13:42.068
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:46.504
Do something!

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:48.208
<i>Warning.</i>

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.243
David, do something.

01:13:52.211 --> 01:13:53.244
<i>Collision alert.</i>

01:13:53.246 --> 01:13:54.279
Open door.

01:13:54.281 --> 01:13:57.284
<i>Affirmative,</i>

01:14:19.908 --> 01:14:21.875

01:14:21.877 --> 01:14:24.344
This is amazing!

01:14:24.346 --> 01:14:28.082
I'm alive! I'm alive!
I'm alive!

01:14:28.084 --> 01:14:29.382
You good back there?

01:14:29.384 --> 01:14:32.388
<i>I'm a dog,</i>
I love wind in my face.

01:14:38.093 --> 01:14:40.293
I love sky sledding.

01:14:40.295 --> 01:14:41.561
They got away!

01:14:41.563 --> 01:14:43.396
- A sky sled.
- Sky sled?

01:14:43.398 --> 01:14:44.999
Sky sled.

01:14:45.001 --> 01:14:46.601
I've got to rethink this
whole boy genius

01:14:46.603 --> 01:14:48.105
stay behind thing.

01:14:54.111 --> 01:14:56.011
I'll fly after them, I'll get
them to land.

01:14:56.013 --> 01:14:58.480
- You? No, we, and I'll drive.
- I'll drive!

01:14:58.482 --> 01:14:59.949
You can barely drive a car!

01:14:59.951 --> 01:15:02.285
Look at your arm,
you can't drive.

01:15:02.287 --> 01:15:04.620
- Just don't kill us.
- Us?

01:15:04.622 --> 01:15:05.624
Just go!

01:15:14.332 --> 01:15:15.869
Watch this, guys.

01:15:19.203 --> 01:15:20.237
Show off!

01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:21.641
Knock it off, Ricky.

01:15:26.244 --> 01:15:29.381
Will that kid ever
stop screaming?

01:15:40.526 --> 01:15:43.226
Where did you learn
how to drive this thing?

01:15:43.228 --> 01:15:46.266
I took an online tutorial,
what did you think?

01:15:50.103 --> 01:15:51.403
Come on, go faster!

01:15:51.405 --> 01:15:52.971
I'm going faster.

01:15:52.973 --> 01:15:54.405
Stop backseat driving.

01:15:54.407 --> 01:15:57.245
This thing was only built
for one person.

01:16:02.582 --> 01:16:04.316
We've got company.

01:16:04.318 --> 01:16:06.254
They're coming!

01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:10.259
Do something! Do something!

01:16:10.725 --> 01:16:12.392
They're coming from
behind us.

01:16:12.394 --> 01:16:15.097
This is getting real,
real fast.

01:16:17.165 --> 01:16:18.397
They're catching up.

01:16:18.399 --> 01:16:19.433
What do I do?

01:16:19.435 --> 01:16:21.568
Ask the flying doohickey.

01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:25.606

Good shot, David!

01:17:03.415 --> 01:17:04.416
Yeah!

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.521
Get the other one,
get the other one!

01:17:10.523 --> 01:17:12.423
There's still one more,

01:17:12.425 --> 01:17:15.395
no time to rest on your
laurels, hot shot.

01:17:18.531 --> 01:17:20.431
Now what?

01:17:23.703 --> 01:17:25.570
Anytime, fly boy.

01:17:25.572 --> 01:17:27.074
Okay, diversion two.

01:17:44.424 --> 01:17:45.624
Yeah!

01:17:45.626 --> 01:17:47.729
Good shot, David, way to go.

01:17:49.763 --> 01:17:51.729
<i>Nice work kid,</i>
nice work.

01:17:51.731 --> 01:17:52.730
<i>Thank you.</i>

Full speed ahead.

01:17:54.468 --> 01:17:56.103
Speed up, Jenny,
come on!

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:57.470
Beat you there!

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:59.139
Those kids are pretty smart,

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:00.474
I'm going to hang back.

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:03.212
We'll catch up with them
on the ground.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.793
I think I hear something.

01:18:18.495 --> 01:18:19.396
It's them!

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:42.383
<i>Doc, Doc,</i>
it's you!

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:44.853
<i>Doc, I knew you'd come back</i>
for me.

01:18:44.855 --> 01:18:47.624
<i>Doc, I've missed you, Doc.</i>

01:18:47.626 --> 01:18:49.491
Oh Murph.

01:18:49.493 --> 01:18:50.926
- I missed you, baby.
<i>- I missed you too.</i>

01:18:50.928 --> 01:18:51.928
I missed you, remember this?

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:53.696
<i>Oh, I loved that.</i>
I loved that.

01:18:53.698 --> 01:18:56.532
<i>Can we go home now?</i>

01:18:56.534 --> 01:18:57.866
Neither of you
are going anywhere.

01:18:57.868 --> 01:18:59.569
Well, why not?

01:18:59.571 --> 01:19:00.938
I can hear him

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.439
in my head?

01:19:02.441 --> 01:19:04.407
Your girlfriend's a
little late

01:19:04.409 --> 01:19:05.643
to the party, Jack.

01:19:05.645 --> 01:19:07.714
What do you mean,
girlfriend.

01:19:08.414 --> 01:19:11.282
Professor, you both have
to come back with us,

01:19:11.284 --> 01:19:12.886
- I'm sorry.
- Not so fast.

01:19:14.286 --> 01:19:15.720
Steven Hill?

01:19:15.722 --> 01:19:16.887
I love your show.

01:19:16.889 --> 01:19:19.224
Thanks, but it's been
canceled.

01:19:19.226 --> 01:19:20.758
However I know a lot of people
in the media

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.627
who would still pay attention
to me,

01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:25.297
especially if I deliver them
a good story about

01:19:25.299 --> 01:19:27.465
about how a great big
corporation treats

01:19:27.467 --> 01:19:28.766
people and dogs poorly.

01:19:28.768 --> 01:19:30.769
Masters and Murphy
are like family

01:19:30.771 --> 01:19:33.372
and Galactatek is tearing
them apart.

01:19:33.374 --> 01:19:35.341
I don't make company policy,
I'm sorry.

01:19:35.343 --> 01:19:38.777
And I don't tear families
apart.

01:19:38.779 --> 01:19:41.314
But we have to write a report,
right?

01:19:41.316 --> 01:19:44.683
We would, if we had
found the dog.

01:19:44.685 --> 01:19:46.485
It's too bad.

01:19:46.487 --> 01:19:48.955
It's a shame we didn't
find the dog.

01:19:48.957 --> 01:19:49.991
<i>She's kind of a</i>
softy

01:19:49.993 --> 01:19:53.329
<i>underneath that tough</i>
spy chick look, Jack.

01:19:53.662 --> 01:19:55.829
Oh no, she's really tough
too.

01:19:55.831 --> 01:19:56.897
It's not just a look.

01:19:56.899 --> 01:19:58.365
But, but I like it.

01:19:58.367 --> 01:19:59.369
I like it.

01:20:00.302 --> 01:20:02.905
Don't go spreading
this around, but uh,

01:20:03.672 --> 01:20:05.275
I like you too, Jack.

01:20:08.578 --> 01:20:09.577
Take it easy, Murph.

01:20:09.579 --> 01:20:10.612
See you later professor.

01:20:10.614 --> 01:20:14.218
<i>Goodbye Jack,</i>
you've been a good guy.

01:20:17.721 --> 01:20:18.722
Come on boy.

01:20:22.593 --> 01:20:25.630
Well, all right, it's time
to say goodbye, guys.

01:20:27.798 --> 01:20:29.430
Say goodbye to him.

01:20:29.432 --> 01:20:31.399
Bye Murph, wish you could've
stayed longer.

01:20:31.401 --> 01:20:32.868
It's like we just met you
and now

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:33.903
you have to leave again.

01:20:33.905 --> 01:20:36.873
<i>Oh kids, I'm going</i>
to miss you too.

01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:39.409
So long, you're the greatest.

01:20:39.411 --> 01:20:40.976
Wish I could have a dog
just like you.

01:20:40.978 --> 01:20:43.445
I can't think of a single
wisecrack.

01:20:43.447 --> 01:20:44.913
I'm going to miss you,
Murph.

01:20:44.915 --> 01:20:47.316
<i>You kids will always</i>
be my heroes.

01:20:47.318 --> 01:20:49.619
<i>I'll keep you in my</i>
heart forever.

01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:50.623
Bye, guys.

01:21:07.807 --> 01:21:09.010
Goodbye Murphy.

01:21:33.401 --> 01:21:36.034
<i>I know goodbyes</i>
are a little bitter sweet,

01:21:36.036 --> 01:21:38.705
<i>but David and Ricky are clever</i>
boys and they wrote

01:21:38.707 --> 01:21:39.773
<i>a better ending.</i>

01:21:39.775 --> 01:21:41.041
<i>And here it is.</i>

01:21:41.043 --> 01:21:44.778
Unresolved
mysteries take one.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.814
<i>Those little loveable</i>
tikes pressed on

01:21:46.816 --> 01:21:47.815
<i>with their show.</i>

01:21:47.817 --> 01:21:48.949
<i>They got Dad to host it,</i>

01:21:48.951 --> 01:21:50.818
<i>even got Mom involved.</i>

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.921
<i>And you know, somehow</i>
it all actually worked.

01:21:53.923 --> 01:21:55.656
<i>Their show started getting</i>
viewers

01:21:55.658 --> 01:21:57.659
<i>in the hundreds,</i>
in the thousands,

01:21:57.661 --> 01:21:58.927
<i>in the millions.</i>

01:21:58.929 --> 01:22:01.963
<i>It went viral and suddenly</i>
the Hill family,

01:22:01.965 --> 01:22:03.131
<i>and their internet show,</i>

01:22:03.133 --> 01:22:05.133
<i>were the talk of the town.</i>

01:22:05.135 --> 01:22:07.000
<i>It could have been the</i>
haunted houses,

01:22:07.002 --> 01:22:08.936
<i>the aliens, or the</i>
crop circles,

01:22:08.938 --> 01:22:10.672
<i>but you know what</i>
I think it was?

01:22:10.674 --> 01:22:12.974
<i>I think it was love.</i>

01:22:12.976 --> 01:22:15.510
<i>With the family working together</i>
the show blossomed

01:22:15.512 --> 01:22:17.479
<i>into something beautiful.</i>

01:22:17.481 --> 01:22:21.653
<i>They'd always had the mysteries,</i>
but now they had the magic.

01:22:32.397 --> 01:22:35.064
Now I know it's true, no
good dead goes unpunished.

01:22:35.066 --> 01:22:37.837
Yeah, well, I'm still glad
we did it.

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.877
All right you two,
you're free to go.

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:47.846
But I thought...

01:22:47.848 --> 01:22:49.780
Yeah, well all the
charges were dropped.

01:22:49.782 --> 01:22:50.582
If you could believe this,

01:22:50.584 --> 01:22:52.449
there was a million dollar
reward.

01:22:52.451 --> 01:22:54.954
You guys can pick it up
at the cashiers.

01:23:01.896 --> 01:23:03.162
Now come on, let's get
out of here.

01:23:03.164 --> 01:23:07.634
