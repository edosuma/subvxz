00:10.143 --> 00:12.345
{\an8}Ugh, I am so hungry.

00:12.412 --> 00:14.180
{\an8}Then go make something.

00:14.247 --> 00:16.983
{\an8}Ugh, I'm so lazy.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.787
{\an8}Whoa! Last week's web cast
of "iCarly,"

00:20.854 --> 00:22.589
{\an8}The most viewers we ever got.

00:22.655 --> 00:23.823
{\an8}Really? How many?

00:23.890 --> 00:25.925
{\an8}355,000.

00:25.992 --> 00:28.561
{\an8}-[laughs] Oh.
-Holy cheese.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.568
Where have you been all day?

00:35.635 --> 00:37.637
Canada.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.806
I thought you were just going
to the art museum.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.575
I was, until I fell asleep
on the bus

00:42.642 --> 00:44.911
and woke up in Vancouver.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.747
I'm so done
with public transportation.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.549
Ah, it's not that bad.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.251
You know, I was born on a bus.

00:51.317 --> 00:52.685
Huh?

00:53.653 --> 00:56.623
My mom's not good at planning.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.493
You know, I'm not sure
it's fair to blame the bus

01:00.560 --> 01:02.028
'cause you fell asleep.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.196
It's not just that.

01:03.263 --> 01:04.330
Last week on the bus,

01:04.397 --> 01:06.099
a hobo spilled chili on me

01:06.166 --> 01:09.169
Then continued to eat it
without a spoon.

01:10.069 --> 01:12.238
I can't believe
you went all the way to Canada.

01:12.305 --> 01:13.907
It wasn't a total lost.

01:13.973 --> 01:18.144
I bought Canadian bacon
while I was there.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.079

01:20.146 --> 01:22.048
-Me.
-Me.

From the president of Daka.

01:29.556 --> 01:30.824
Daka, the shoe company?

01:30.890 --> 01:32.325
-Yeah.
-Read it.

01:32.392 --> 01:34.694
"Dear Carly, we're big fans
of your web show."

01:34.761 --> 01:36.396
-Wow.
-Cool.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.337
-No way.
-That's awesome.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.139
Oh.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.608
This is just sliced ham.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.580
How dare those Canadians try
and pass this off

01:53.646 --> 01:56.616
as some sort of fancy bacon.

-Nice.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.000
I like it.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.336
Where did you get
the turkey sandwich?

03:23.403 --> 03:25.071
Found it on some dude's desk.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.642
All right.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.411
-Let's go over the game plan.
-What do you mean?

03:31.477 --> 03:33.179
We don't even know
what they want from us.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.214
Well, they probably know that
lots of people watch "iCarly, "

03:35.281 --> 03:36.549
so I bet they want us

03:36.616 --> 03:37.884
to promote some shoes
or something.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.686
-Cool.
-Yeah, if they pay us.

03:39.752 --> 03:42.388
We should get 50 bucks cash
or no deal.

03:42.455 --> 03:45.458
"iCarly"'s got a huge audience.
We should get at least 100.

03:45.525 --> 03:46.492
Okay.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.860
We'll ask for 100.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.330
I hope
they don't think that's pushy.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.731
Yeah.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.300
I'd hate for anyone
to think I'm pushy.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.703
I swear.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.372
One minute my turkey sandwich
was sitting there on my desk

03:59.439 --> 04:00.673
and then gone.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.742
-Get over it, Braxley.
-I'm stupid.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.711

04:04.777 --> 04:06.079
Sam.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.580
-Freddie.
-Hey.

04:07.647 --> 04:10.617
I'm Greg Horvath,
president of Daka shoes.

04:10.683 --> 04:12.352
Please, sit down.
Have a seat.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.687
We have a lot to discuss,

04:14.754 --> 04:17.890
[overlapping chatter]
A lot to discuss indeed.

04:22.362 --> 04:24.497
Our marketing team
is very familiar

04:24.564 --> 04:26.766
With your web show, "iCarly."

04:26.833 --> 04:28.801
[overlapping
affirmative chatter]

04:28.868 --> 04:31.771
Apparently, you're getting
300,000 viewers a week.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.939
More.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.273
Impressive.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.742
And that's why Daka

04:35.808 --> 04:38.378
would like to advertise
our new sneaker

04:38.444 --> 04:39.746
on your show.

04:39.812 --> 04:42.649
[overlapping
affirmative chatter]

04:42.715 --> 04:45.051
-Oh, here it is.
-Here it is.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.132
-Awesome.
-Sweet shoe.

04:59.198 --> 05:00.199
That's so cool.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.734
The Techfoot

05:01.801 --> 05:04.570
is our most technologically
advanced shoe ever.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.072
It has a pedometer,

05:06.139 --> 05:07.740
so you know exactly
How many steps you've run,

05:07.807 --> 05:09.275
walked, or jogged.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.611
It has a foot warmer
for when your feet get cold,

05:11.678 --> 05:16.549
And it even offers
Wi-Fi connectivity.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.518
I call it shoe-fi.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.219
-Braxley.
-I'm stupid.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.088
So, how do you want us...

I'm Sam.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.564
We love the new Techfoot.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.733
Yes, the new Techfoot.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.837
They are fantastic. Mm-hmm.

05:39.939 --> 05:42.175
That's what we want you to do.

05:42.241 --> 05:44.210
Carly and Sam just talk
about the shoes

05:44.277 --> 05:46.279
-while they're doing "iCarly"?
-Exactly.

05:46.345 --> 05:47.647
Because if your audience knows

05:47.714 --> 05:49.515
that you guys love
the new Techfoot,

05:49.582 --> 05:51.651
then they'll go out
and buy 'em.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.919
So how much
are you gonna pay us?

05:52.985 --> 05:55.388
Sam.
You don't say it like that.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.692
So...how much
are you gonna pay us?

06:00.526 --> 06:02.128
How much do you want?

06:03.062 --> 06:04.297
We want 100.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.833
Deal. We'll pay you $100,000.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.769

-Sam, Sam.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.308

06:20.213 --> 06:23.416
Now, $100,000
paid over one year comes to...

06:23.483 --> 06:25.651
Over $8,000 a month.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.120
Do we have a deal?

06:27.186 --> 06:28.755

-Yes.
-Uh-huh.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.993

-Keep it going.
-Yeah.

10:11.243 --> 10:12.645
Why don't we tell everybody

10:12.712 --> 10:13.879
about the insanely
awesome new shoes

10:13.946 --> 10:14.947
we got the other day?

10:15.014 --> 10:16.682
You know, we should.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.017
Okay.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.019
These bad boys
are called Techfoots.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.254
[exhales sharply]
By Daka.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.858
And not only
did they look cool...

10:25.925 --> 10:27.660
They have
a built-in foot warmer.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.228
They have a digital pedometer

10:29.295 --> 10:31.197
to tell you how far
you've run, walked, or jogged.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.165
They even have
Wi-Fi connectivity.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.735
I mean,
who wouldn't buy these shoes?

10:35.801 --> 10:37.503
Jerks.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.338
So quit being a jerk

10:39.405 --> 10:41.574
and go buy yourself
a pair of Techfoots.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.176
Woosh. By Daka.

10:44.243 --> 10:45.244
Hula hula.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.813
Hula, hula, hula,
hula, hula, hula.

10:51.050 --> 10:54.553
[squeaking]

11:02.762 --> 11:05.498
[squeaking]

11:05.564 --> 11:07.366
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.601
Your feet hurt, too?

11:08.667 --> 11:10.269
Yeah. These Techfoots
are killing me.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.103
Mine, too.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.271
Oh, and last night,

11:12.338 --> 11:13.706
I tried to use
the Wi-Fi on 'em

11:13.773 --> 11:16.409
And they crashed
my new Devaglio.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.745
And I think these things
are squeaking even louder.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.547
I know. Mine too.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.850
[squeaking]

11:29.989 --> 11:31.590
-Oh, my gosh!
-What happened?

11:31.657 --> 11:35.261
I stepped in a little puddle
and my Techfoot shocked me.

11:35.327 --> 11:36.629
No way.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.364
And then
they totally fell apart.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.166
Hey, thanks for telling us
to buy Techfoots.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.435
Really awesome shoes.

11:42.501 --> 11:43.636
We want our money back

11:43.702 --> 11:46.372
Well,
we didn't sell you the shoes.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.908
Fine. Then we're just gonna
stop watching "iCarly."

11:48.974 --> 11:50.242
Yeah.

11:50.309 --> 11:52.445
There's plenty of other things
to watch.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.182
I hate these stupid Techfoots.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.290
[electricity crackling]

12:26.045 --> 12:27.780
Techfoot.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.184
This is bad.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.619
It's not that bad.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.588
Thousands of people wearing
the worst shoe in history

12:35.654 --> 12:36.989
cause of "iCarly,"

12:37.056 --> 12:39.492
'cause we told them
how great they are?

12:39.558 --> 12:41.260
This is bad.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.931
[groans]

12:52.138 --> 12:53.839
I need some milk.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.710
What happened
to your homemade bike?

12:57.776 --> 13:00.179
I chained it up by the curb
for a few minutes

13:00.246 --> 13:02.848
and one of those street sweeper
truck things came by

13:02.915 --> 13:04.850
and sucked it right in.

13:05.651 --> 13:08.454
Well, maybe you should Just
start riding the bus again.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.889
Not happening.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.790
I'll just get around
in an old fashion way.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.359
You're gonna walk everywhere?

13:13.425 --> 13:14.560
No.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.729
I'm gonna blade.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.503
So what are we gonna do
about these jankfoots?

13:24.570 --> 13:26.038
Well we better do something

13:26.105 --> 13:28.340
unless we want "iCarly"
to keep losing viewers.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.743
Blubbery muffins?

13:31.744 --> 13:33.312
What?

13:33.379 --> 13:35.147
Blubbery?

13:36.482 --> 13:37.783
Blueberry.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.019
Sorry, Sonya,
we're too upset to eat.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.054
[whimpers]

13:48.594 --> 13:49.862
How about this.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.330
We go talk to the guys
at the Daka,

13:51.397 --> 13:52.598
tell him everything

13:52.665 --> 13:53.732
that's wrong
with the Techfoots,

13:53.799 --> 13:54.967
and then maybe they'll fix 'em.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.368
I think that's smart.

13:56.435 --> 13:57.770
Sam?

13:59.138 --> 14:01.840
Oh, sorry,
I was lost in this muffin.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.345
[giddy shouting]

14:09.848 --> 14:11.717
Whoo!

14:11.784 --> 14:14.787
If you need me,
I will be at the gym.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.991
Whoo!

14:29.969 --> 14:32.037
Will you get the door?

14:33.939 --> 14:36.809
[indistinct chatter]

14:36.875 --> 14:38.978
Hey, hey, it's the iCarly team.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.180
-How you guys doin'?
-Not so great.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.115
We need to talk to you guys
about the Techfoot.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.984
They have a ton of problems.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.820
Problems? Like?

14:47.886 --> 14:49.989
Well, first,
they squeak really bad.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.191
And the Wi-Fi
crashed my computer.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.193
Carly got shocked
when she stepped in a puddle.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.828
And then
they practically fell apart.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.764
And when I throw 'em away,
they exploded.

14:59.698 --> 15:01.400
You know
when you put out a new shoe,

15:01.467 --> 15:03.736
they always have
a few minor problems.

15:03.802 --> 15:04.837
Minor?

15:04.903 --> 15:06.372
What would be a major problem?

15:06.438 --> 15:08.574
If they came to life
in the middle of the night

15:08.641 --> 15:10.209
and ate your family?

15:11.010 --> 15:13.112
I live alone.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.381
Look, either you make

15:15.447 --> 15:17.182
the shoes work like
they're supposed to...

15:17.249 --> 15:19.351
Or we will never talk
about them on "iCarly" again.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.986
-Yeah.
-Look.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.122
You signed a deal
with Daka shoes

15:23.188 --> 15:24.790
and you took our money

15:24.857 --> 15:27.926
so you're gonna keep talking
up the Techfoots on "iCarly"

15:27.993 --> 15:29.828
or you're gonna be
in big legal trouble.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.230
We're not scared of you.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.065
Yeah, my uncle happens
to be a lawyer.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.267
-I thought he got arrested?
-Shhh.

15:41.407 --> 15:42.775
Here's another one.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.910
"Why don't you iCarly jerks
come over to my house

15:44.977 --> 15:46.278
"so I could put on
my new Techfoots

15:46.345 --> 15:48.881
and jump and down
on your faces."

15:50.382 --> 15:51.617
This is awful.

15:51.684 --> 15:52.685
I know.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.086
Half our audience hates us,

15:54.153 --> 15:56.288
and we're completely
out of blubbery muffins.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.591
Look, on "iCarly" tonight,

15:59.658 --> 16:02.127
you guys got to tell everyone
that Techfoots bite.

16:02.194 --> 16:05.631
No thanks, I don't wanna get
sued for everything I have.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.666
What do you have?

16:07.733 --> 16:09.435
Oh, yeah.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.770
[groans]

16:11.837 --> 16:14.640
Spencer. What happened?

16:14.707 --> 16:16.141
One minute

16:16.208 --> 16:18.744
I'm blading down Hill Street,
feeling good,

16:18.811 --> 16:20.412
on top of the world,

16:20.479 --> 16:22.281
and the next thing
I know--bam!

16:22.348 --> 16:25.050
I got a face full of dumpster.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.920
Well, that's it.

16:27.986 --> 16:31.323
From now on, Spencer's walkin'.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.658
[groans]

16:32.725 --> 16:34.393
Aw.

16:34.460 --> 16:37.329
Didn't Spencer go to law school
for, like, 20 minutes?

16:38.664 --> 16:41.367
-Three days, thank you.
-Well, do you think

16:41.433 --> 16:43.235
you could help us get
out of a contract?

16:43.302 --> 16:44.570
What? The Techfoot one?

16:44.636 --> 16:45.838
-Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

16:45.904 --> 16:46.872
Well, I have to read it,

16:46.939 --> 16:48.173
but if there's one thing

16:48.240 --> 16:51.577
I learned in my 72 hours
of law school,

16:51.643 --> 16:54.380
it's that every contract
has a loophole.

16:54.446 --> 16:55.714
So you'll help us?

16:55.781 --> 16:57.950
Sure, but not right now, okay?

16:58.016 --> 16:59.852
I just had to walk
eight miles to get home

16:59.918 --> 17:02.988
and I'm tired and sad.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.191
Aw.

17:06.258 --> 17:07.960
You wanna
nice bowl of hot soup?

17:08.026 --> 17:10.729
-Yes please.
-Sonya!

17:10.796 --> 17:12.196
Yoo-hoo!

17:15.334 --> 17:19.805
In five, four, three, two...

17:19.872 --> 17:22.207
Hey.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.276
Okay, this is "iCarly."

17:24.343 --> 17:26.377
And before we do
anything else tonight.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.012
We wanna talk to you guys
some more about

17:28.079 --> 17:29.681
The incredible
new Techfoot shoes

17:29.748 --> 17:31.016
we told you about last week.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.684
We're gonna show you
all the reasons

17:32.751 --> 17:34.686
why Techfoots are so unique.

17:34.753 --> 17:35.754
Hey, Carly.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.055
Yes, Sam.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.057
Do your feet
ever get hot And sweaty?

17:39.124 --> 17:41.427
Only always.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.829
Well, that's not a problem
with Techfoots.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.264
Don't I know it?

17:45.330 --> 17:47.533
'Cause all you got to do
is get them a little wet.

17:47.599 --> 17:48.767
Like when it rains.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.503
And then you can just

17:51.570 --> 17:55.674
shove your toe
to the front like this.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.709
How wonderful.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.512
And now our technical producer,
Freddie,

18:00.579 --> 18:01.980
will show you
another cool thing

18:02.047 --> 18:03.682
about the Techfoot.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.117
Okay.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.985
If your computer's hard drive
is cluttered

18:07.052 --> 18:08.720
with a bunch of files, music,

18:08.787 --> 18:11.790
and precious pictures
of family and friends,

18:11.857 --> 18:15.461
the Techfoot does an amazing
thing with Wi-Fi technology.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.763
See,
you just sync the pedometer

18:17.830 --> 18:21.400
up to your computer and...

18:21.467 --> 18:23.936
it wipes out
your entire hard drive.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.171
Isn't that great?

18:26.238 --> 18:28.307
-We're going over there.
-We'll go over there...

18:28.373 --> 18:31.043
[overlapping
affirmative chatter]

18:32.077 --> 18:33.645
And wait till you see this.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.180
For those cold winter days.

18:35.247 --> 18:38.050
Every Techfoot comes
with a built-in toe warmer.

18:38.116 --> 18:40.085
And if you turn
the toe-warmer on high.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.720
Like this.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.722
Then bang it on the table.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.625
[electricity crackling]

18:48.327 --> 18:51.029
It magically catches on fire.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.764
Isn't that handy?

18:52.831 --> 18:55.534
That'll keep your piggies warm.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.569
And not only that...

18:57.636 --> 18:59.471
It's also perfect for...

18:59.538 --> 19:02.174
Roasting weenies.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.475
So go out right now

19:03.542 --> 19:05.410
and buy yourself
a pair of Techfoots.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.447
Cause this is one hot shoe.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.253
You were warned.
I warned you.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.621
-Did I warn them?
-Oh, yes you warned them.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.422
Not only
did you violate your contract

19:17.489 --> 19:20.025
by not saying
good things about the shoe,

19:20.092 --> 19:22.060
you besmirched
the name of the Techfoot

19:22.127 --> 19:23.629
by criticizing it.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.564
You think that I won't take
legal action against you?

19:25.631 --> 19:28.100
You think that
I'm above suing children?

19:28.166 --> 19:29.501
Well, I'm not.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.770
So I hope you
have a good lawyer.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.071
Oh, we do.

19:33.138 --> 19:35.107
[footsteps approaching]
Gentlemen,

19:35.173 --> 19:40.045
I'm their lawyer,
and this is my necktie.

19:42.548 --> 19:43.549
Cool tie.

19:43.615 --> 19:44.783
Yeah?
Where did you get it?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.985
Socco's brother, Tyler.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.354
Now I understand that
you're peeved at my clients.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.057
They were in violation
of a signed contract.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.727
Your contract states only

19:55.794 --> 19:58.630
that the members of "iCarly"
must comment on your shoe,

19:58.697 --> 20:01.033
the Techfoot,
in a positive way.

20:01.099 --> 20:03.735
-Which they didn't.
-Wrong sir.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.272
I reviewed
the webcast in question,

20:07.339 --> 20:09.274
and they only said
positive things

20:09.341 --> 20:10.876
about the Techfoot.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.811
Exhibit "A."

20:12.878 --> 20:14.980
And then you can just

20:15.047 --> 20:17.449
shove your toes to the front

20:17.516 --> 20:19.718
to cool them off like this.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.954
How wonderful.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.388
Exhibit B.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.023
Like a magic eraser.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.159
Isn't that great?

20:27.225 --> 20:29.628
And exhibit C.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.263
It's also perfect for...

20:31.330 --> 20:34.132
Roasting weenies.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.538
How wonderful.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.306
Isn't that great?

20:41.373 --> 20:43.542
Roasting weenies.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.712
Those sound like
very positive comments.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.013
Wouldn't you agree?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.247
'cause I sure think
a judge would,

20:49.314 --> 20:53.185
certainly
one who enjoys weenies.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.223
And we're gonna keep talking
about the Techfoots

20:58.290 --> 20:59.758
in a "positive way."

20:59.825 --> 21:01.226
Just like we did tonight.

21:01.293 --> 21:05.197
To over 300,000 "iCarly" fans
every week.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.001
[indistinct, low chatter]

21:09.067 --> 21:10.202
Why are we huddling?

21:10.268 --> 21:12.404
I don't know.
They're doing it.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.239
-All right.
-[clears throat]

21:14.306 --> 21:15.674
If you'll stop talking

21:15.741 --> 21:18.276
about the Techfoot on "iCarly"
completely,

21:18.343 --> 21:19.478
then we're prepared

21:19.544 --> 21:21.813
to buy you out
of your contract.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.048
For how much?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.050
-Ten thousand.
-Twenty thousand.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.952
-Fifteen thousand.
-Thirty thousand.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.220
What?

21:28.286 --> 21:29.888
And you have to give
full refunds

21:29.955 --> 21:31.056
to every "iCarly" viewer

21:31.123 --> 21:32.424
who bought jankfoots.

21:32.491 --> 21:35.494
-Techfoots.
-I know what I said.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.563
And what if I say no?

21:38.630 --> 21:40.632
Then we sue you.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.268
All right.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.604
Braxley, write her out
a check for $30,000.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.406
Nuh-uh. Cash.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.709
All right.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.913
Blubbery muffins?

21:59.851 --> 22:01.453
I'm stupid.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.158
Keep it coming. This is good.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.560
This is fun.
This is a fun time.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.199
Where are we going?

22:14.266 --> 22:15.467
Can you not try
not to talk so much?

22:15.534 --> 22:16.601
Just give me a hint.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.904
Oh, look who keep saying words.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.205
But why can't you tell me

22:20.272 --> 22:21.707
Why I have to wear
this blindfold?

22:21.773 --> 22:24.276
Hey, just be quiet
and take off your blindfold.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.982
-What is this?
-A motorcycle.

22:31.049 --> 22:32.184
I bought it for you

22:32.250 --> 22:33.685
So you don't have
to ride buses,

22:33.752 --> 22:36.822
Or janky bikes,
Or rollerblade into dumpsters.

22:36.888 --> 22:38.990
You spent
your Techfoot money on me?

22:39.057 --> 22:40.325
I got it 'cause of you.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.961
-You.
-You.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.698
Stick this on your head
and get on.

22:46.765 --> 22:48.366
Okay.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.238
Where are we going?

22:53.305 --> 22:55.240
Canada.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.375
-See, you love their bacon.
-I do.

22:57.442 --> 22:59.811
{\an8}-Even if it is just ham.
-It's good ham.

22:59.878 --> 23:00.946
{\an8}All ham is good ham.

23:01.012 --> 23:02.748
{\an8}Touché.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.556
-Hey!
-You there!

23:11.623 --> 23:13.391
You wanna see us do stuff
you can't see anywhere else?

23:13.458 --> 23:14.860
-Do you?
-I think they do.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.728
Then go online to iCarly.com.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.396
Yeah! Go to iCarly.com.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.099
Once you get to iCarly.com,
you can see me and Carly...

23:21.166 --> 23:22.367
And Freddie and Spencer

23:22.434 --> 23:23.969
do all kinds
of wacky fun stuff.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.937
You know
you like wacky fun stuff.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.806
So go online to iCarly.com.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.975
And see stuff
you can't see anywhere else.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.376
Only at iCarly.com.

23:31.443 --> 23:32.644
-So go there.
-Do it.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.146
Seriously.
