00:01.202 --> 00:04.272
[dramatic music]

00:06.107 --> 00:09.310
*

00:09.343 --> 00:10.811
- My name is Steve Godfrey.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.746
I'm 47 years old.

00:12.780 --> 00:16.250
I have been bladesmithing
since 1984,

00:16.284 --> 00:18.219
but professionally,
I'm a medium.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.088
*

00:20.121 --> 00:22.156
- My name is Thor Lars Laizans.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.691
My cousins over in Denmark,

00:23.724 --> 00:25.693
they all call me
the American Viking.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.528
Blades do run in my blood.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.630
It's something
that my ancestors have done

00:29.663 --> 00:32.200
for hundreds of years.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.367
- My name is Nick.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.335
I'm the owner and sole smith

00:34.368 --> 00:36.237
of the Red Troll Forge.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.838
I do demonstrations
on blacksmithing

00:37.871 --> 00:39.640
and try
to keep people entertained.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.510
Most people know me as Grendel,
the big red troll.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.845
I'm having a good time!
Rah!

00:44.878 --> 00:47.748
- My name's Dustin Rhodes.
I'm 35 years old.

00:47.781 --> 00:51.385
When I was 12, my family started
to do frontier reenactment.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.454
I always loved
knives and swords,

00:53.487 --> 00:55.423
so I started making my own.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.226
The words my dad told me will
always stand out in my mind.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.462
"Damn it, boy, quit playing
in the damn campfire!"

01:01.495 --> 01:03.697
- Gentlemen.

01:03.731 --> 01:04.865
Welcome to the Forge.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.400
Here, every aspect

01:06.434 --> 01:08.302
of your bladesmithing
capabilities

01:08.336 --> 01:11.105
will be put to the test,
and you will be evaluated

01:11.139 --> 01:13.807
every step of the way
by our panel of expert judges.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.109
Let's meet them now.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.710
World-renowned master bladesmith

01:16.744 --> 01:18.279
Jason Knight.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.114
Historic weapons
re-creation specialist

01:20.148 --> 01:21.382
David Baker.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.617
And last,
edged weapons specialist

01:23.651 --> 01:26.554
and kali martial artist
Doug Marcaida.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.356
Ultimately, they decide
which of you will be

01:28.389 --> 01:29.890
the next
"Forged in Fire" champion,

01:29.923 --> 01:32.760
who will also receive a check
for 10 grand.

01:32.793 --> 01:36.364
I'm sure you guys noticed my
collection of vintage golf gear.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.532
I assure you
we're not hitting the links.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.301
Today you'll be forging
signature blades

01:40.334 --> 01:43.471
harvested from the steel
in these golf clubs.

01:43.504 --> 01:46.840
- Golf clubs?
What?

01:46.874 --> 01:48.542
- Just to make things
more interesting,

01:48.576 --> 01:50.611
I'm also including
a golf ball-sized bearing,

01:50.644 --> 01:53.481
a 52-100
high-carbon chromium steel

01:53.514 --> 01:56.850
that you must also incorporate
into your blade.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.552
- I was happy to see
the ball bearing.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.622
I know what to do with that,
but golf clubs?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.457
Who makes knives
out of golf clubs?

02:03.491 --> 02:05.259
- Your finished weapons
will be tested

02:05.293 --> 02:08.529
for strength and durability
in a vertical log chop

02:08.562 --> 02:11.365
and edge retention
in a ham slice.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.367
You will have ten minutes
to work on your design.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.803
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.371
When the time runs out

02:17.405 --> 02:19.507
and the judges have evaluated
your work,

02:19.540 --> 02:21.409
one of you will be asked
to leave the Forge.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.910
Good luck, gentlemen.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.746
Your ten-minute design window
starts now.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.781
*

02:27.815 --> 02:31.419
All right, Jason,
what on those golf clubs

02:31.452 --> 02:33.454
is usable material?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.356
- Those golf club heads are made

02:35.389 --> 02:37.825
out of some kind
of low-carbon steel,

02:37.858 --> 02:41.395
so I would take that
and the ball bearing

02:41.429 --> 02:45.366
and then laminate them together
however they choose.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.600
- I'm looking
at these materials,

02:46.634 --> 02:48.236
and I'm going, what's usable?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.303
- I wonder if the shafts
are worth anything.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.772
- They seem to be...

02:51.805 --> 02:53.874
- No, they're not.
- No, they're not.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.543
- Is that the best way to tell

02:55.576 --> 02:56.977
whether your metal is strong
or not?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.680
- No.
- [laughs]

02:59.713 --> 03:02.583
- What I'm gonna make
is a combat camp knife.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.718
Gives you a little more
leverage when you're cutting.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.755
I'm anticipating having to do
a san mai construction,

03:07.788 --> 03:10.324
forging out the heads
of those golf clubs,

03:10.358 --> 03:12.760
and sandwiching
that bearing steel between it.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.963
*

03:15.996 --> 03:18.399
- I want to make a bowie knife.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.969
My game plan for this
is a little bit different

03:22.002 --> 03:24.438
than everyone else is gonna do.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.307
I'm using
the shaft of the golf club.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.542
It may be round,
but as I cut it

03:28.576 --> 03:30.711
and kind of fillet it up
into pieces,

03:30.744 --> 03:31.945
it's kind of flat steel.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.314
- Have you ever made a knife

03:33.347 --> 03:34.648
out of a golf club?

03:34.682 --> 03:36.784
- No.
I've never even golfed before.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.587
So...

03:39.620 --> 03:41.522
The hardest part
about using the golf clubs

03:41.555 --> 03:44.258
is how to put the steel
together.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.527
Probably the best way,
put the head

03:46.560 --> 03:48.396
of at least two
of the golf clubs

03:48.429 --> 03:50.664
in a sandwich,
forge-weld 'em together,

03:50.698 --> 03:53.467
and make a blade that way.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.370
My plan
is to make a camp knife.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.306
It has a wide belly,

03:58.339 --> 03:59.940
and it should cut
right through that meat.

04:01.675 --> 04:05.446
- Nicholas is tasting the clubs.
- [chuckles]

04:05.479 --> 04:07.047
- I do this all the time
with steel,

04:07.080 --> 04:09.450
to see
if I can tell what it is.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.519
- Agh!

04:11.552 --> 04:12.686
- You can sort of tell,
a little bit,

04:12.720 --> 04:14.955
sometimes, by the taste on it.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.724
- Hey, man,
everybody got their way.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.593
- The head is probably
the most usable object

04:19.627 --> 04:21.895
'cause the shaft,
it seems to be mild steel,

04:21.929 --> 04:23.731
not a high-carbon steel.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.599
I picked the seax,
which is very simple.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.001
Straight edge.
Slightly curved back.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.904
It's a shape that stand
the test of history.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.507
- Bladesmiths. Your ten-minute
design window is closed.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.644
Your three-hour forge time
starts now.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.447
*

04:39.480 --> 04:41.382
[machinery buzzing]

04:41.415 --> 04:42.683
*

04:42.716 --> 04:45.586
- Most bladesmiths
are not used to

04:45.619 --> 04:47.054
using this type of material.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.057
They're used to flat bar stock,
you know?

04:50.090 --> 04:52.560
*

04:52.593 --> 04:54.495
- That's hot enough to burn
the damn hair off your chest.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.764
*

04:56.797 --> 04:59.066
- Dustin's right to the press
with the ball bearing.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.835
It hasn't been in the forge
that long.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.571
- Ideally, you want more heat.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.539
It doesn't want to move too well

05:05.573 --> 05:08.442
when you get it
below 1500 degrees.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.546
- Oh! Knocked his bearing
right off his stick.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.415
- Fire on the floor.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.483
*

05:15.516 --> 05:17.918
- Hello, Mr. Golf Club.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.120
I'm gonna make a knife
out of you.

05:20.153 --> 05:24.458
- I believe that Nicholas is
gonna be very entertaining.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.927
- My plan is to do
a sandwich sort of thing,

05:26.960 --> 05:28.396
with the ball bearing
in the center

05:28.429 --> 05:29.830
and the mystery metal
of the putters

05:29.863 --> 05:31.365
on the outside,

05:31.399 --> 05:33.634
flatten those out
into a bar shape,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.936
stack all three together,

05:35.969 --> 05:38.372
and then just smash it flat.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.009
Ha-ha-ha!

05:42.042 --> 05:43.711
Smash!

05:43.744 --> 05:45.679
[sparks sizzling]

05:45.713 --> 05:47.515
- My plan for this challenge

05:47.548 --> 05:50.984
is to get the billet made
in the first hour.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.654
- Here's an interesting thing
about Steve.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.056
He's a medium.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.058
- Well, I'm a large.

05:58.091 --> 06:02.129
[all laugh]

06:02.162 --> 06:04.097
- I love everything
about bladesmithing.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.734
I love the connection
to the past.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.637
Occasionally,
when I'm hammering at the forge,

06:09.670 --> 06:12.072
I'll get a glimpse
of some past lives.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.808
I'm pretty sure
I used to build samurai swords.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.577
*

06:16.610 --> 06:19.413
I suppose I'm the only medium

06:19.447 --> 06:20.514
who's a bladesmith.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.849
I'm not aware of any others.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.851
But you know, I put my pants on

06:23.884 --> 06:25.453
one leg after the next,

06:25.486 --> 06:27.455
and I just happen to be able

06:27.488 --> 06:29.590
to communicate with the folks
on the other side.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.824
*

06:30.858 --> 06:31.825
This is great.

06:34.495 --> 06:38.131
- What's interesting is
Thor's approach to this

06:38.165 --> 06:40.133
compared
to the rest of these guys.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.003
They all grabbed
the golf club head.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.872
If I had the call,
that's what I'd grab.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.774
He's going with the shaft.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.209
- The shaft of this golf club's
gonna be thin,

06:49.242 --> 06:52.179
so it'll be easily forge-weld
together,

06:52.212 --> 06:54.682
and I think it's gonna make
a great piece of steel.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.950
- One hour has elapsed!

06:56.984 --> 06:58.452
- Whoo-hoo!
- You have just two hours

06:58.486 --> 07:00.087
remaining to finish your blades!

07:00.120 --> 07:03.491
- [shouts]
- [laughs]

07:03.524 --> 07:05.793
- I got the steel all stacked,
welded together.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.662
Now I just gotta take it
from basically a bar

07:08.696 --> 07:10.764
into a knife shape.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.200
What I really like
about bladesmithing

07:13.233 --> 07:15.969
is that I'm not really actually
thinking all that much.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.105
I'm just doing.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.707
It's one of those...

07:19.740 --> 07:21.074
I don't know,
a zen sort of thing.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.944
I get in the zone
and go for it.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.946
- I think that Nicholas is
just having a good time.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.816
- He is definitely having
a good time.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.017
*

07:30.050 --> 07:32.185
- Thor's steel, it's drawn out.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.122
It looks like
it's a nice, even color.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.124
- I got all my materials

07:37.157 --> 07:38.826
welded together...

07:38.859 --> 07:42.262
so I'm ready to go
start shaping my blade.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.498
When I make a blade,

07:44.532 --> 07:46.567
I'm giving someone
a piece of my heart and soul.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.202
That's part of my life
that I'm handing over to them.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.839
- I just think
it's too skinny and too lean.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.875
- I would never have chosen
the golf club shaft

07:54.908 --> 07:56.644
because it's so thin.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.812
There's just not enough material
there.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.848
- [bleep].

08:00.881 --> 08:02.750
Everybody has
an "oh, [bleep]" moment.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.585
Blade's not gonna be
near as wide

08:04.618 --> 08:05.919
as what I wanted it to be.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.655
- Every time he hits that thing,

08:07.688 --> 08:09.256
it's getting longer
and longer and longer,

08:09.289 --> 08:11.191
but it's not widening out.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.860
- Potential for failure here

08:12.893 --> 08:14.762
is definitely gonna be
in the log chop,

08:14.795 --> 08:17.598
so if I'm gonna have

08:17.631 --> 08:18.666
a narrower blade,

08:18.699 --> 08:20.133
I would rather make it

08:20.167 --> 08:21.735
completely
from the better material.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.971
So I decide at that point,

08:24.004 --> 08:26.306
I'm gonna add the golf club
head to the tang.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.175
I've drawn out a stub tang.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.743
This is a high-carbon steel.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.244
I'm gonna weld it
to the low-carbon

08:31.278 --> 08:35.048
so the low-carbon
will all be in the tang.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.885
- Now, Dustin, he did
a high-carbon steel billet

08:37.918 --> 08:39.553
and a low-carbon steel,
and he's gonna

08:39.587 --> 08:41.722
attach them at this juncture.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.791
- As long as
it's forge-welded together,

08:43.824 --> 08:45.793
it should be just fine,
right, Dave?

08:45.826 --> 08:47.695
- It really depends
on how much metal you have,

08:47.728 --> 08:48.996
where it is.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.764
- It's a little thin.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.566
If it doesn't turn out right,

08:52.600 --> 08:53.634
I don't have a knife.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.604
*

08:58.972 --> 09:01.074
- Steven's got his steel
forge-welded together,

09:01.108 --> 09:03.711
and he's drawing out his piece
really nice.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.878
- It's looking great.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.113
I'm thinking, hey, you know,

09:06.146 --> 09:08.115
it looks like
I got a good weld.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.050
Ah.
- Nope. Nope.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.084
Nope.
It just popped up on the end.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.653
Did you see that?

09:12.686 --> 09:14.988
- Okay.
So we got a delam at the end.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.190
I hit it,
and the thing just pops apart.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.892
Oh!

09:18.926 --> 09:20.060
- Steve is over here
trying to get

09:20.093 --> 09:21.962
his welds to stick.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.797
- Whoa, that's a lot of flux.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.799
The magic dust, man.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.201
- I hit it again.
Son of a gun.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.138
And it does the same thing.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.841
- I learned that if you don't
get it to stick the first time,

09:33.874 --> 09:35.643
it probably won't stick.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.344
- I'm just thinking,
yep, I'm going home.

09:37.377 --> 09:42.015
[laughs]

09:42.049 --> 09:43.150
- Steve is over here

09:43.183 --> 09:45.753
trying to get
his welds to stick.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.788
- He does have
part of that weld.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.758
He can actually cut out
those edge delaminations.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.794
- We're doing a redesign.
Okay.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.396
I'm going to cut off
those little delams

09:56.429 --> 09:58.065
that run across the blade.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.033
Hopefully,
that's gonna fix this.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.702
- I think
that that's a smart move.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.837
- God willing.
[laughs]

10:03.871 --> 10:05.873
- Two hours has elapsed!

10:05.906 --> 10:07.908
You have only 60 minutes
remaining

10:07.941 --> 10:10.043
to finish your blades!

10:10.077 --> 10:12.312
- The blade basic shape
is all there.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.814
Rather than
having to drill the holes

10:13.847 --> 10:15.716
after it's probably hardened...

10:15.749 --> 10:18.318
I am punching the holes
for the scales for the tang.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.687
- Look at that.
Look at that.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.822
We have holes being drifted.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.056
Drifting holes
is not the easiest thing

10:23.090 --> 10:24.858
on the planet to do well.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.227
Those are skills you develop
over a lot of time.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.031
- Yeah!

10:31.064 --> 10:32.833
One time I got the advantage.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.668
*

10:34.702 --> 10:36.269
I've got my forge-welding done.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.005
The tang took--
it's a little thinner

10:38.038 --> 10:40.073
than I wanted it to be
at that junction,

10:40.107 --> 10:41.108
but this'll work.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.676
At this point,

10:42.710 --> 10:45.078
I've got to get the blade
hardened.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.747
If it's not hardened,
it's not a blade.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.181
Fire in the hole!

10:48.215 --> 10:52.419
*

10:52.452 --> 10:53.987
- Look at Dustin's junction
right now.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.789
- He's got two pieces
of material

10:55.823 --> 10:56.990
coming together

10:57.024 --> 10:58.692
at what is the thinnest spot

10:58.726 --> 11:00.260
on that entire blade.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.730
- For a log chop,
that could possibly be

11:02.763 --> 11:06.033
a catastrophic failure.

11:06.066 --> 11:10.070
- We're gonna do a little
old-fashioned heat treating.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.772
So I'm heating this edge up
with the torch,

11:11.805 --> 11:13.306
and I'm seeing
those little delams.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.408
Delam city. Whoo!

11:15.442 --> 11:17.410
And I'm just praying

11:17.444 --> 11:19.112
that they aren't
gonna come apart

11:19.146 --> 11:20.247
further in testing.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.949
That's the very thing

11:21.982 --> 11:23.250
that can send you home.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.718
- 15 minutes!

11:24.752 --> 11:26.854
Steven has quenched.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.722
Dustin has quenched.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.791
Nicholas has quenched.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.826
- The fires of Mordor
over there.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.327
[laughs]

11:34.361 --> 11:37.097
- Thor is way behind
everybody else.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.999
- Ugh!

11:39.032 --> 11:41.234
- Banging on a cold blade.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.803
- Ho-ho.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.304
- It's fine.
It hasn't broke yet.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.039
- Yeah, it hasn't broke yet.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.910
- Oh!

11:49.943 --> 11:51.278
Oh, my God.
Thor--

11:51.311 --> 11:53.146
the tip just broke off
of Thor's blade.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.514
Oh, my God.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.250
*

11:57.284 --> 12:00.020
- This is why you do not hammer
when it's cold.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.288
You just don't do it.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.289
- With the tip broken

12:02.322 --> 12:03.924
and ten minutes left,

12:03.957 --> 12:05.058
nothing else I can do.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.193
I'm pretty sure

12:06.226 --> 12:07.294
I'll be sent home for this.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.328
[bleep].

12:08.361 --> 12:10.263
- Well, weld the sucker back on!

12:10.297 --> 12:12.800
- But I'm a Viking.
I'm a warrior at heart.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.102
- He's not quitting.
He's heading over to the welder.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.138
- When I go to do something,
I'm gonna get it done.

12:18.171 --> 12:22.409
- He can still at least turn in
a quenched, hardened blade.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.977
- That actually makes me smile,

12:24.011 --> 12:25.112
to see that he just keeps going.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.346
I was like, I love it.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.481
- It's back on.
The tip is back on.

12:28.515 --> 12:32.019
- Yes, but is that tip going to
hold together in testing?

12:32.052 --> 12:33.787
- One minute, bladesmiths!

12:33.821 --> 12:36.423
- Quench.
Come on. There you go.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.391
- And he's in the quench.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.526
*

12:39.559 --> 12:42.529
Ten. Nine. Eight.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.432
Seven. Six. Five!

12:45.465 --> 12:49.436
Four! Three! Two! One!

12:49.469 --> 12:53.273
Bladesmiths, drop your tools!
Shut down your machines!

12:53.306 --> 12:56.109
- I don't give up.
It's go big or go home.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.978
I got it all done,
and I got it done on time,

12:58.011 --> 13:01.248
and I'm satisfied with that.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.117
- My biggest concern
are those little delams

13:04.151 --> 13:05.485
that run across the blade.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.387
I've seen guys get sent home
for that,

13:07.420 --> 13:10.190
so hopefully,
that's not gonna be me.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.558
- Bladesmiths.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.861
In just three hours,
you managed to take

13:13.894 --> 13:16.563
some vintage golf clubs
and forge signature blades.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.166
Now it's time to see
if your work's up to par.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.467
Nicholas, you're up first.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.171
- Drifting holes.
Nice to see.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.438
It's gonna set you up
really nicely

13:25.472 --> 13:27.007
for a second round.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.309
All in all,
your welds look good.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.878
Great job.
- Thank you.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.245
- Well, Nicholas,
lines of your design,

13:32.279 --> 13:33.413
a little bit off.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.514
Curvy.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.983
But overall, a nice work.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.218
Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.020
- Steve, you're up.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.424
- This is a robust knife.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.493
Your forge welding is okay.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.161
*

13:48.195 --> 13:50.430
But you do have
some delamination here.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.600
*

13:53.633 --> 13:55.402
However, it doesn't concern me

13:55.435 --> 13:57.871
as far as it coming apart.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.073
Well done.
- Thank you.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.574
- Thor, you're up.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.043
- Thor, you started out

14:03.076 --> 14:04.511
with that golf shaft material.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.380
It was so thin,
once you had it in the forge,

14:07.414 --> 14:09.149
it was almost like
there was nothing left

14:09.182 --> 14:10.583
but forge scale.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.219
But here's something
I really like.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.587
You had that blade tip
snapping off,

14:14.621 --> 14:16.223
and you didn't give up.

14:16.256 --> 14:19.226
You went back,
and you welded that back on.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.995
- Design-wise,
it's got a nice profile to that.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.998
Overall, it's very lean
and very skinny,

14:25.032 --> 14:26.433
so you can start to see
some issues,

14:26.466 --> 14:28.401
how it's so thin
over here in the tang.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.638
It's in question
for its structure.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.206
But you never gave up,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.608
and thank you for that.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.643
- Dustin.

14:36.676 --> 14:40.113
*

14:40.147 --> 14:42.115
- Well, Dustin, I like the idea

14:42.149 --> 14:44.451
of putting these two metals
together,

14:44.484 --> 14:47.320
with the high-carbon right here
and the low-carbon over here.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.389
We haven't seen that done
in this competition yet.

14:49.422 --> 14:53.060
But this junction right here
is very lean and skinny

14:53.093 --> 14:55.495
and showing some cold shuts.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.665
That is a very big concern
for us.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.634
Challenge we have is a log chop.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.603
If you look at the profile
right there, it's a big concern,

15:03.636 --> 15:05.638
'cause you could have
a catastrophic failure

15:05.672 --> 15:07.374
if that breaks away.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.708
- Well, bladesmiths,

15:08.741 --> 15:10.643
the judges have looked
at your work,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.512
and they have a decision
to make,

15:12.545 --> 15:14.081
so I need you
to leave your blades here.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.049
Thank you.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.550
*

15:17.584 --> 15:18.585
- Hoo.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.987
*

15:20.020 --> 15:22.055
- Uff da.
- How about that?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.591
- [laughs]
- I don't know, man.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.094
- All right, judges,
are there blades here

15:27.127 --> 15:29.362
that are moving forward,
no doubt in your mind?

15:29.396 --> 15:32.265
- Yeah, Steve's and Nick's.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.101
- Okay.
We'll start with Thor's blade.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.738
- We don't have
a lot of knife here.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.009
There are no edge bevels
forged into this.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.244
It is the same thickness
from the back to the front.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.646
Handle is incredibly thin here.

15:46.679 --> 15:50.117
I'm-I'm amazed
that it's even together.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.352
So I see
using the shaft of the golf club

15:52.385 --> 15:55.155
as a bad choice,
not a good strategy.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.656
- Okay.

15:56.689 --> 15:57.657
Let's move on to Dustin's blade

15:57.690 --> 15:59.092
there on the end.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.328
What do you think, Doug?

16:01.361 --> 16:04.064
- Oh, they got mine.
That's not good.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.765
- The biggest issue we have
right now

16:05.798 --> 16:07.567
is this juncture right here

16:07.600 --> 16:09.536
where both middles
come into play.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.039
You can see the cold shuts
right there.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.706
You know, that could be
a catastrophic failure.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.043
Who knows whether that end
right there will hold?

16:17.677 --> 16:21.148
- Well, judges,
of these two blades,

16:21.181 --> 16:24.117
which one is worse
than the other?

16:24.151 --> 16:25.485
I need your final decision.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.287
Doug, have you made yours?
- Yes, I have.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.588
- Dave?
- Yep.

16:28.621 --> 16:29.589
- Jason?
- Yeah, man.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.059
- Let's go tell our smiths.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.460
All right, gentlemen.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.628
The judges have made
their final decision.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.430
It's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.732
*

16:39.766 --> 16:43.503
Thor. Your blade
did not make the cut.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.438
- Thor, the blade
you turned in to us

16:45.472 --> 16:48.641
had some problems
that we just can't overlook.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.810
The fact that the tip broke off.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.579
I appreciate the fact
that you tried

16:52.612 --> 16:55.282
to weld that back on
to bring us a finished piece,

16:55.315 --> 16:58.351
but in the end, the problem is,
it being so thin,

16:58.385 --> 17:00.420
it's just not executed in a way

17:00.453 --> 17:02.822
that's gonna hold up
to our chop and slice tests,

17:02.855 --> 17:05.692
and that's why
we're letting you go.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.495
- Thor,
please surrender your blade.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.330
- A Viking never gives up,

17:10.363 --> 17:12.365
and I didn't give up
during this challenge.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.666
It's been an honor.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.168
I always say, I mean,

17:15.202 --> 17:17.137
with failure comes success.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.471
I've always taken
the hardest route,

17:18.505 --> 17:20.540
and I've always learned
the hard way,

17:20.573 --> 17:22.275
but it's gotten me
where I'm at,

17:22.309 --> 17:23.243
and I'm proud of myself.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.112
[cymbal shimmers]

17:25.145 --> 17:26.579
- Gentlemen, congratulations

17:26.613 --> 17:28.515
on making it
to the second round.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.117
In this round,
you'll be attaching handles

17:30.150 --> 17:31.384
using the range of materials

17:31.418 --> 17:32.852
provided in our pantry,

17:32.885 --> 17:35.255
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

17:35.288 --> 17:37.290
that will then be tested
for strength and durability

17:37.324 --> 17:39.726
in a vertical log chop...

17:39.759 --> 17:42.362
and for edge retention
in a ham slice.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.530
[cymbal shimmers]

17:43.563 --> 17:46.299
And... you must also incorporate

17:46.333 --> 17:48.135
one element from these golf bags

17:48.168 --> 17:52.139
in a visible way
into your handle's design.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.607
Gentlemen, you will have
three hours in this round.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.210
You can use that time
to address any flaws or issues

17:57.244 --> 17:58.745
that were identified
in your blades.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.114
At the end of this round,
one of you

18:01.148 --> 18:02.682
will have to surrender
his weapon

18:02.715 --> 18:04.817
and leave the Forge.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.653
Your time starts...

18:06.686 --> 18:08.588
Now.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.623
Let's talk a little bit
about what's in these bags.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.525
They can use
the metal from the clubs,

18:12.559 --> 18:14.194
the wood heads from the clubs--

18:14.227 --> 18:15.828
they can use the bags.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.731
- Not seeing a whole lot
of usable material on that.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.867
I've got to make sure
this handle is as strong

18:20.900 --> 18:22.602
as it possibly can be.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.837
Is there anything
in this golf bag

18:24.871 --> 18:27.407
that's gonna allow me
to make a strong handle?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.508
No.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.243
- Getting anything fun?

18:30.277 --> 18:31.578
- Nothing yet.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.413
- I would use the shaft material

18:33.446 --> 18:34.647
for, like, a lanyard hole.

18:34.681 --> 18:35.815
- Mm, that could work.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.850
- A pin could.
- A pin.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.220
- So I find a small piece
of aluminum that I can

18:40.253 --> 18:42.855
use it as an ornamentation
for the butt cap.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.657
- That's pretty cool.
- I think it's a great idea.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.792
*

18:45.825 --> 18:46.759
- Grab some G10.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.495
Trace out my tang.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.596
I'm gonna do
a three-piece construction.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.564
Plan is, I'm gonna take this

18:51.598 --> 18:54.267
and encase my tang with it.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.570
It should reinforce the areas
that I'm concerned about.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.672
- It's good to see Dustin
fix the issue

18:59.706 --> 19:01.308
that everybody's
wondering about.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.212
*

19:05.245 --> 19:07.580
- Micarta is
virtually indestructible,

19:07.614 --> 19:12.285
so it's the perfect choice
I believe for the log chop test.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.788
- The handle is just as
important as the blade.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.525
- Let's go cut this sucker up.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.959
- It's the main seat
of controls.

19:19.992 --> 19:20.960
You don't take a car out

19:20.993 --> 19:22.462
without a steering wheel.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.930
- I'm going with three pins

19:23.963 --> 19:24.964
for the handle.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.866
I'm using two brass rods

19:26.899 --> 19:30.903
and one of the rods
from the golf club handle.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.372
What I'm hoping
I'm gonna be able to do

19:32.405 --> 19:33.540
is make a functional handle

19:33.573 --> 19:35.408
that's comfortable for the user.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.610
*

19:37.644 --> 19:40.980
- My whole plan is to use stuff
I know already,

19:41.013 --> 19:43.516
besides the fact of using
golf club shafts as pins,

19:43.550 --> 19:44.817
but...

19:44.851 --> 19:46.886
Mix it up round and round.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.322
I take the two pieces of Micarta
that I've cut out.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.958
Now I apply glue all over it,
just goo that all up.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.393
Pah!

19:53.426 --> 19:55.528
- Did Nicholas just taste
the epoxy?

19:55.562 --> 19:58.565
- Yes, he did.
- [laughs]

19:58.598 --> 20:00.400
- Just seeing what it was like.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.370
- I enjoy watching him work.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.904
- One hour has elapsed.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.607
You have two hours remaining
to finish your work.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.476
Dustin over here,
it looks like

20:09.509 --> 20:11.344
he's planning on doing a mortise

20:11.378 --> 20:13.280
to a piece of Micarta
over there.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.381
- That might work really well.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.448
He's got material

20:15.482 --> 20:16.883
all the way around that neck.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.485
- Got a little bit of gap,

20:18.518 --> 20:20.420
so I'm gonna backfill that
with epoxy,

20:20.453 --> 20:22.655
and I'm hoping
that that's going to eliminate

20:22.689 --> 20:24.924
any flex, anything
that's gonna potentially cause

20:24.957 --> 20:26.593
this tang to fail.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.528
Little concerned
about this slick surface

20:28.561 --> 20:31.798
and how the epoxy's
actually gonna adhere to it.

20:31.831 --> 20:32.999
This is something
I've never done,

20:33.032 --> 20:34.634
and I hope it works well

20:34.667 --> 20:36.603
because there's no going back.

20:36.636 --> 20:39.272
[bleep].

20:39.306 --> 20:40.573
- It's bleeding
out of that hole.

20:40.607 --> 20:44.844
- [bleep]. [bleep]. [bleep].

20:44.877 --> 20:45.945
There's no going back,

20:45.978 --> 20:47.647
so I'm just gonna roll with it.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.516
I'm gonna add additional epoxy

20:49.549 --> 20:50.983
to fill up any gaps.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.052
- No pins.
- Yeah, that's a big problem.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.821
I would put a pin in it

20:54.854 --> 20:58.658
because he has multiple layers
of handle material.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.793
- I'm thinking
about pinning it.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.464
I probably won't, though,
because this is pretty solid.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.367
- Is it still questionable
without a pin?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.535
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.802
- He's gonna have so much glue.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.704
- I've seen glue get loose.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.640
- It's wider at the back.
It's not gonna come out.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.074
The whole handle's
gonna have to come apart

21:15.107 --> 21:16.809
for it to come out.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.078
- Just, you know, having
that mechanical connection

21:19.111 --> 21:20.547
is just a good idea.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.048
- Two hours has elapsed!

21:22.081 --> 21:24.751
You have one hour remaining
to finish your work.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.986
*

21:27.019 --> 21:29.021
- The most crucial thing is

21:29.055 --> 21:31.724
to make sure
that this is a handle

21:31.758 --> 21:33.059
that the judge can really grip.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.093
I like it.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.896
- That is a fat handle, man.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.632
- Especially with
having a shorter handle,

21:39.666 --> 21:41.768
I have to make sure
that I get this right.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.103
Otherwise, I'm going home.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.938
- Look at Nick's handle.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.441
It looks spindly.

21:48.475 --> 21:52.712
- Maybe Steven will share
some of his handle with him.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.747
- The handle I am making is

21:54.781 --> 21:56.416
just very simple, very plain.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.751
It's almost like
a kitchen knife.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.487
A nice, sturdy handle.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.054
- When it's too straight,

22:02.088 --> 22:05.625
it just doesn't distribute
the energy evenly.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.926
When you're chopping
on that log,

22:06.959 --> 22:08.595
you're gonna feel it
after ten chops.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.597
*

22:10.630 --> 22:13.533
- My motivation and inspiration
in bladesmithing

22:13.566 --> 22:15.468
is mostly
putting the fear of God

22:15.502 --> 22:18.438
into young men
who want to date my daughter.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.907
- Dustin over here
is still working on that inlay.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.743
- The inlay for the butt cap,
it's a little challenging.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.712
I'm thinking, "Ah...

22:25.745 --> 22:27.814
Was I thinking the right thing,
to do this?"

22:27.847 --> 22:30.417
- He hasn't done
any golf parts yet,

22:30.450 --> 22:33.052
so he has to get that right.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.622
*

22:35.655 --> 22:37.156
- Think we're almost there.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.091
I'm gonna work on the delams
a little bit,

22:39.125 --> 22:40.527
get this blade straightened out,

22:40.560 --> 22:42.161
and I'll go from there.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.563
- Steven's hand doesn't even go

22:43.596 --> 22:45.097
all the way around the handle,

22:45.131 --> 22:46.999
and it doesn't look like
he plans on

22:47.033 --> 22:48.868
thinning that out
too much at all.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.404
He can't assume
that that's gonna feel good

22:51.438 --> 22:54.006
in anybody else's hand.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.142
*

22:56.175 --> 22:57.810
- The handle's
pretty well complete.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.612
It's polished again,
etched again,

22:59.646 --> 23:01.581
and I went,
"Well, I need to test it."

23:01.614 --> 23:03.516
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.984
- I test
on the back of my neck,

23:05.017 --> 23:07.053
'cause, well,
I need to shave that anyway.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.622
- [laughs]
- He's not even looking.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.727
- Ten. Nine. Eight.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.863
Seven. Six.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.865
Five. Four.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.834
Three. Two. One.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.503
Bladesmiths,
your time is elapsed.

23:23.536 --> 23:24.704
Please secure your blades,

23:24.737 --> 23:27.006
and head back to your anvils.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.108
- I'm pretty happy with it
at this point.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.677
I'm sure this is a solid blade.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.445
I'm pretty sure it'll hold up.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.713
- I'm better
at making the blade

23:33.746 --> 23:35.848
than I am making the handle,

23:35.882 --> 23:37.584
so we'll see what happens
when they test it.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.186
- Gentlemen,
this is the strength test.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.955
I'll be testing the strength
and durability of your knives

23:42.989 --> 23:46.926
by chopping into this
piece of wood ten times.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.227
Steve, are you ready?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.697
- Absolutely.
- You better be.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.131
- I've looked at my blade.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.833
I've looked
at the other blades.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.102
I know the type of blade
that I've made

23:56.135 --> 23:58.805
is a very good chopping knife,

23:58.838 --> 24:00.973
so I'm confident this blade
is gonna perform well.

24:03.843 --> 24:10.783
*

24:19.025 --> 24:20.560
- Steven.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.496
I love the edge geometry
you have right here.

24:23.530 --> 24:28.200
I hate the handle geometry
you have right here.

24:28.234 --> 24:31.270
This handle's very difficult
to hang on to.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.607
I don't like to have to think
about how I'm holding the knife

24:34.641 --> 24:36.709
and re-gripping and re-gripping,

24:36.743 --> 24:40.513
and I'm cutting this--
I had to do that several times.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.882
But it cut.
It's sharp.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.117
There's no damage to the edge.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.855
Nicholas, you're next.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.791
- I am totally confident
it'll meet all the criteria.

24:51.824 --> 24:55.728
It'll chop a chunk of wood.
It'll slice a ham in half.

24:55.762 --> 24:58.698
And it won't break doing it,
so... there.

24:59.899 --> 25:06.806
*

25:13.580 --> 25:17.283
- Well, Nicholas,
there's no damage to your edge.

25:17.316 --> 25:21.888
But it is not my favorite shape
that I've ever seen in a knife.

25:21.921 --> 25:26.859
I appreciate that you put
three lanyard pins in it,

25:26.893 --> 25:28.294
and I used this one
for the lanyard,

25:28.327 --> 25:29.562
which worked good.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.998
However, your handle being

25:32.031 --> 25:34.901
very skinny makes it difficult

25:34.934 --> 25:37.169
to keep it from
ratcheting out of my hand,

25:37.203 --> 25:38.838
and if it wasn't
for that lanyard,

25:38.871 --> 25:40.306
it would have wiggled out.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.308
If we're designing a knife
for chopping,

25:42.341 --> 25:44.043
I don't want to have to think
about that.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.746
I just want to let the tool
do the work.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.315
But it was sharp.
There's no damage.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.317
Overall, not bad.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.219
Dustin. Are you ready?

25:53.252 --> 25:54.721
- Hell, yeah.
- All right.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.623
*

25:56.656 --> 25:58.725
- I feel pretty confident
going into testing.

25:58.758 --> 25:59.926
I know my handle's strong.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.928
I know my blade's strong.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.697
But the junction between
the blade and the tang itself

26:04.731 --> 26:06.065
worries me a little bit.

26:07.333 --> 26:13.072
*

26:13.105 --> 26:14.674
- I know my handle's strong.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.776
I know my blade's strong.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.711
The only thing
that I'm really concerned about

26:18.745 --> 26:20.747
is that cold shut on the tang.

26:22.749 --> 26:28.587
*

26:35.728 --> 26:39.031
*

26:39.065 --> 26:41.200
- I do like
your usage of the...

26:41.233 --> 26:42.935
what was that, golf club?

26:42.969 --> 26:44.937
- Yeah, it was on the golf club.
- Yeah. Now...

26:44.971 --> 26:49.375
*

26:49.408 --> 26:52.011
You know,
our concern was your tang.

26:52.044 --> 26:56.282
In here, you had very weak weld.

26:56.315 --> 27:01.253
You wisely chose carbon fiber
to, you know, bind that up.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.123
However,
there's a significant crack

27:04.156 --> 27:06.826
between the carbon fiber
and the G10

27:06.859 --> 27:08.928
on this side and the front.

27:08.961 --> 27:12.832
Where your hardened steel
was forge-welded

27:12.865 --> 27:14.901
to the softer steel has broken.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.236
That's the only thing
that could have happened here,

27:17.269 --> 27:19.338
and that was what we were
afraid of in the first place.

27:19.371 --> 27:22.909
It makes it unsafe to use.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.845
- Fair enough.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.147
- Dustin, due to the critical
failure in your blade,

27:28.180 --> 27:30.783
we cannot continue
with the testing.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.820
Therefore, I have to ask you
to please leave the Forge.

27:33.853 --> 27:36.823
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

27:36.856 --> 27:39.959
I would not disagree
with the judge's decision.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.229
The failure was something
that I had somewhat anticipated.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.463
I really listened to the judges

27:44.496 --> 27:45.832
about what they said

27:45.865 --> 27:46.933
about strengthening the tang,

27:46.966 --> 27:48.067
and I did my damndest,

27:48.100 --> 27:49.301
and it just didn't work.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.003
*

27:51.037 --> 27:53.172
- Steve. Nick.
Congratulations.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.941
The strength of your work,
coupled with

27:54.974 --> 27:57.109
your competitors' failures
to perform,

27:57.143 --> 27:59.746
have secured you both
a place in the third round,

27:59.779 --> 28:01.180
where we will send you home

28:01.213 --> 28:04.216
to re-create
an iconic blade from history.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.152
Are you ready to see
what that weapon is?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.987
- Oh, yeah. Yep.
- Yes, I am.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.389
- Your final challenge is...

28:10.422 --> 28:12.158
*

28:12.191 --> 28:13.492
Deerhorn knives.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.794
*

28:14.827 --> 28:16.228
- Whoa.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.064
- Deerhorn knives
are distinctive

28:18.097 --> 28:19.465
double-bladed weapons

28:19.498 --> 28:21.000
used
as an extension of the body

28:21.033 --> 28:22.769
to counter and disarm
opponents.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.037
The knives are unique
to the 19th-century

28:25.071 --> 28:26.739
martial art form baguazhang.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.507
Students of this discipline
train

28:28.540 --> 28:29.475
with the weapon in both hands

28:29.508 --> 28:30.743
to master techniques

28:30.777 --> 28:32.411
in slashing and seizing.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.014
Easily concealed
in traditional Chinese garb,

28:35.047 --> 28:37.083
these mighty knives
can be swiftly brandished

28:37.116 --> 28:38.951
to catch an opponent off guard

28:38.985 --> 28:40.486
and deliver deadly cuts

28:40.519 --> 28:42.121
with four horn-shaped points.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.890
The weapons
are notably employed

28:43.923 --> 28:47.226
in the film "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon."

28:47.259 --> 28:49.395
- I've never heard
of a deerhorn knife.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.298
It's definitely not a design
I'm familiar with.

28:52.331 --> 28:56.535
- I was hoping
for a fairly simple sword.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.904
- They must be authentic,

28:57.937 --> 28:59.906
working versions
of these weapons.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.108
You will have five days
at your home forge

29:02.141 --> 29:04.476
to fulfill
the following parameters.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.979
Each knife must include
a center handle

29:07.013 --> 29:09.315
on two overlapping crescents.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.051
Additionally,
every forward-facing edge

29:12.084 --> 29:13.552
must be sharpened.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.454
*

29:15.487 --> 29:17.156
At the end of five days,
you will return

29:17.189 --> 29:19.458
and present your weapons
to our panel of expert judges.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.393
After they've evaluated
your work

29:21.427 --> 29:22.461
and tested your weapons,

29:22.494 --> 29:23.796
they will declare one of you

29:23.830 --> 29:25.464
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

29:25.497 --> 29:29.235
who also receives $10,000.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.837
Good luck, bladesmiths.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.304
We'll see you in five days.

29:32.338 --> 29:35.274
*

29:36.608 --> 29:39.912
[dramatic music]

29:39.946 --> 29:41.313
- I'm back at my home forge,
ready to make

29:41.347 --> 29:43.282
a really strange Chinese weapon.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.884
My big "wow" factor
for this one

29:44.917 --> 29:46.252
is actually doing it
out of Damascus.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.921
A few layers of steel
stacked together,

29:48.955 --> 29:50.522
forge-welded together,
to make 'em one piece.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.324
In we go.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.160
The steels don't quite mix,

29:54.193 --> 29:55.527
so you get this nice pattern
going through it.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.264
Everything's looking
really good.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.967
There's two basic ways
you can make this weapon.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.368
One is to take
one large piece of steel,

30:02.401 --> 30:04.170
make cuts in it,
and then bend it

30:04.203 --> 30:06.205
all out into shape.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.207
However, getting
the final product to look good

30:08.240 --> 30:10.009
will be difficult.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.610
What I'm gonna try to do
is make it into

30:11.643 --> 30:13.379
two separate crescent shapes

30:13.412 --> 30:15.481
and forge-weld
where they overlap.

30:15.514 --> 30:16.615
*

30:16.648 --> 30:18.985
Smiley face.
Devil!

30:19.018 --> 30:20.552
That style of forge weld,

30:20.586 --> 30:22.254
this is something
I've never actually done,

30:22.288 --> 30:23.622
so I want to test it,

30:23.655 --> 30:25.524
so I'm taking two pieces
of scrap steel,

30:25.557 --> 30:26.859
forge weld them together,

30:26.893 --> 30:27.894
put it in a vice,

30:27.927 --> 30:28.995
and smack it with a hammer

30:29.028 --> 30:30.562
to see if a piece snaps off.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.935
I didn't want to see that.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.403
The forge weld didn't work.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.971
It's a failure.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.039
Now what?

30:40.072 --> 30:44.176
*

30:44.210 --> 30:47.947
- Today,
I start the deerhorn knife.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.917
I want to make this thing
look like deer antlers.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.352
I'm used to making
straight pieces.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.988
This thing has curves
all over the place.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.157
And I have to make
two of these things!

30:58.190 --> 30:59.892
Now I have to figure out

30:59.926 --> 31:03.129
how I'm gonna make this
out of this.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.331
*

31:05.364 --> 31:08.167
I want to forge this
out of one piece of steel.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.136
That's the strongest way
you can do it.

31:10.169 --> 31:13.039
I'm gonna cut a slit
down the center of this bar,

31:13.072 --> 31:15.441
spread the handle
and the front blade apart,

31:15.474 --> 31:17.977
and hopefully,
it all is gonna go to plan.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.047
[machinery whirring]

31:21.080 --> 31:23.515
That looks a lot more like
a deer antler.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.151
*

31:25.184 --> 31:26.385
- Day two.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.120
I am tired, and I'm sore.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.923
Think I'm getting sick.
[coughs]

31:30.957 --> 31:32.424
First things first,

31:32.458 --> 31:34.293
I'm going to run
a couple more tests

31:34.326 --> 31:36.362
on how to weld
two pieces of steel together

31:36.395 --> 31:37.463
and not have them break.

31:39.966 --> 31:42.101
There we go.
That's what I want to see.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.203
It bent, rather than breaking.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.272
Butt weld it is.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.340
So I decide to do a butt weld.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.442
I'm going to be cutting
the crescents apart

31:50.476 --> 31:52.178
and welding it flat on,

31:52.211 --> 31:53.379
so now the edges will line up.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.047
It looks very nice.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.582
Ready to do the heat treat.
No! No!

31:56.615 --> 31:59.085
I don't want to go
in the fire again!

31:59.118 --> 32:01.320
Ah!

32:01.353 --> 32:03.022
My only concern right now is,

32:03.055 --> 32:06.692
if this weird shape decides
to warp at all,

32:06.725 --> 32:08.260
it could be a problem.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.661
Into the quench.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.366
*

32:14.400 --> 32:15.434
There we go.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.503
*

32:17.536 --> 32:19.671
That is as hard as the file.

32:19.705 --> 32:23.709
It didn't warp into a pretzel,
so hey, I'm great.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.311
- Day four.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.346
I've got both of these weapons
shaped.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.347
It's time to harden them.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.515
This is the moment.

32:29.548 --> 32:30.482
This has to work.

32:30.516 --> 32:31.683
If it doesn't,

32:31.717 --> 32:33.285
I'm not gonna have a weapon.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.991
Hey. No warpage.

32:39.025 --> 32:39.992
Let's see if we got hard.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.662
It worked.

32:43.695 --> 32:44.997
I feel really great.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.033
I'm grinding the bevels,

32:47.066 --> 32:49.401
everything
is coming together...

32:49.435 --> 32:50.736
and then I see it.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.204
Uh-oh.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.205
*

32:53.239 --> 32:54.373
I've got a crack

32:54.406 --> 32:55.474
in one of my blades.

32:55.507 --> 32:56.675
That's heartbreaking.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.444
It's going through both ends,

32:58.477 --> 33:00.379
and there's nothing I can do
about it.

33:00.412 --> 33:01.747
I've got to test it.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.316
*

33:04.350 --> 33:06.385
I need a pole of some kind.

33:06.418 --> 33:09.321
I know they're gonna do
something like this.

33:10.689 --> 33:15.627
*

33:17.796 --> 33:22.268
[sighs]

33:22.301 --> 33:23.535
- Day five.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.404
I feel like crap.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.373
If it wasn't for
the fact that I'm sick,

33:27.406 --> 33:29.741
I actually kind of like
this deep, gravelly voice.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.577
If I didn't have to
hack up my lung to do it,

33:31.610 --> 33:33.512
I'd have it all the time.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.681
All I have left to do
is put the handles on

33:35.714 --> 33:37.616
and sharpen the blades.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.285
Putting the handles on is

33:39.318 --> 33:41.153
shaping the material
a little bit,

33:41.187 --> 33:43.422
gluing them on,
drilling the holes,

33:43.455 --> 33:46.258
and putting the pins in place
to hold everything together.

33:46.292 --> 33:47.626
That's all ready to go.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.096
*

33:50.129 --> 33:52.198
There's seven different edges
on this thing.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.166
Just freaking dangerous.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.834
It's all nice and sharp now.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.136
Let's see what we can do
with this.

33:57.169 --> 34:03.742
*

34:03.775 --> 34:05.377
I...

34:05.411 --> 34:07.045
I don't want to get hit by it.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.217
- It's day five,
and I have to start over.

34:11.250 --> 34:14.753
I've got one day
to build a pair of these.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.755
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to do it or not.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.692
If I wasn't the underdog
before,

34:20.726 --> 34:23.095
I definitely am now.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.696
I just want to have something
to take there.

34:24.730 --> 34:28.567
I have three days of work to do
in ten hours.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.336
At this point,

34:30.369 --> 34:32.538
I don't have time
for any mistakes.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.473
I just need to stay
in the game.

34:34.506 --> 34:35.774
*

34:35.807 --> 34:38.677
[dramatic music]

34:38.710 --> 34:39.811
*

34:39.845 --> 34:41.413
- Welcome back.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.881
You've had five days
at your home forge

34:42.914 --> 34:44.350
to work on your deerhorn knives.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.218
Steve, how did it go?

34:46.252 --> 34:48.254
- It was an adventure.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.855
Day four, I broke my blade.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.458
Had to start over again.

34:52.491 --> 34:56.495
Built a second set in ten hours,
so I wasn't able to do

34:56.528 --> 35:00.399
the fancy fit and finish
that I normally would've done,

35:00.432 --> 35:01.733
but I believe
it's gonna perform well.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.569
*

35:03.602 --> 35:05.571
- Nicholas, how'd it go?
- It went pretty well.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.440
Except I got a cold.
That's all right.

35:08.474 --> 35:11.177
My blade is 29 layers
of Damascus

35:11.210 --> 35:13.445
with G10 handles
with decorative pins.

35:13.479 --> 35:16.282
Little problems,
but I could handle it.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.883
- Now it's time to see
how they perform.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.651
Up first is the kill test.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.654
Doug?
- Oh, boy.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.223
*

35:24.256 --> 35:25.591
- To see how lethal
your weapon is,

35:25.624 --> 35:27.626
I will deliver
multiple slashes and thrusts

35:27.659 --> 35:30.296
on this pig carcass.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.930
Steve, you're up first.
Are you ready?

35:31.963 --> 35:34.233
- Absolutely.
- Let's do this.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.834
- I thought I was gonna show up
empty-handed,

35:35.867 --> 35:37.436
but I asked for some help.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.438
I started talking
to my grandpa,

35:39.471 --> 35:40.806
my grandmother.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.474
I could feel their presence.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.643
I knew
everything was gonna be okay.

35:44.676 --> 35:48.280
I'm really hoping to hear,
you know, "It will kill."

35:50.216 --> 35:52.918
[intense percussive music]

35:52.951 --> 35:59.891
*

36:01.293 --> 36:03.295
Whoa.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.963
- Well, Steve,

36:04.996 --> 36:07.899
you know, I was surprised,
being that you only have a scale

36:07.933 --> 36:10.769
on one side for the handle
and not on the other.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.239
It is a rustic look,
but nonetheless,

36:13.272 --> 36:15.507
it is actually comfortable
to hold onto.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.609
Your tips over there,
sharp enough to cut,

36:17.643 --> 36:19.511
easy to thrust,
with the bottom,

36:19.545 --> 36:21.347
and deliver a slice
at the same time.

36:21.380 --> 36:25.617
Overall, your weapon will kill.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.353
- Yeah.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.455
- All right, Nick.
You're next. Are you ready?

36:29.488 --> 36:31.523
- Oh, yeah.

36:31.557 --> 36:38.464
*

36:46.938 --> 36:48.974
- Well, Nick,
your weapon is very sharp.

36:49.007 --> 36:51.277
Grabbing your handle,
it feels smooth

36:51.310 --> 36:52.844
with both scales in there.

36:52.878 --> 36:57.449
The angles you have
really lacerate deeply,

36:57.483 --> 37:00.319
and overall,
your weapon will kill.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.753
Good job.
- Thank you.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.889
- Next up is the sharpness test.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.457
To see how sharp
your weapons are,

37:05.491 --> 37:06.792
I will take your weapons

37:06.825 --> 37:08.860
and deliver
multiple slashes and stabs

37:08.894 --> 37:10.962
on this ballistic bag.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.598
The bag is outfitted
with two posts,

37:12.631 --> 37:14.966
which simulates blocks or blows
from pole weapons

37:15.000 --> 37:17.569
these knives would encounter
in battle.

37:17.603 --> 37:18.604
Steve, you're up first.
Are you ready?

37:18.637 --> 37:20.639
- Yes, I am.

37:20.672 --> 37:27.613
*

37:33.885 --> 37:36.021
- Well, Steve,
the points are sharp.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.556
They lacerate cleanly.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.658
It feels good in the hand.
I can maneuver.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.561
This, sir, will cut.
- Thank you.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.062
- Nick, you're up next.
Are you ready?

37:44.095 --> 37:45.030
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:45.063 --> 37:46.565
I'm pretty confident

37:46.598 --> 37:47.833
mine's gonna do
at least that well,

37:47.866 --> 37:49.501
probably better
because my points

37:49.535 --> 37:51.737
are more pointier.

37:51.770 --> 37:58.710
*

38:04.416 --> 38:06.552
- Well, Nick, you can see
that it penetrates deep,

38:06.585 --> 38:08.987
the angles you have them in,
and lacerates out.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.722
They're comfortable in the hand,

38:10.756 --> 38:13.525
and your blades will cut.

38:13.559 --> 38:14.893
- Thank you.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.995
- Next up is the strength test.
Dave?

38:17.028 --> 38:18.764
- To test the strength
of your weapons,

38:18.797 --> 38:21.099
we're going to clamp them
into our contraption back here.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.602
Once triggered,
a staff will strike

38:23.635 --> 38:25.871
the center section
of each of the blades

38:25.904 --> 38:28.807
one time
with the force of 2,000 pounds,

38:28.840 --> 38:30.776
simulating the kind of attacks
these weapons

38:30.809 --> 38:32.678
could historically encounter
in combat.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.381
- Contraption, as he says.

38:35.414 --> 38:38.517
It looks like
a overgrown Erector set.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.452
- Steve, are you ready?
- Yes, I am.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.754
I have to admit,
I'm a little nervous.

38:44.956 --> 38:48.460
And I'm a little concerned

38:48.494 --> 38:50.929
- I'm a little concerned
about what's gonna happen

38:50.962 --> 38:53.599
when they whack that thing
with a baton.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.370
- In three, two, one...

38:59.738 --> 39:00.872
*

39:00.906 --> 39:04.376
In three, two, one...

39:08.480 --> 39:10.882
Yeah, well, Steve,
I don't see any damage,

39:10.916 --> 39:13.919
any rolling of the edge,
so they held up beautifully.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.554
- That's great.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.589
- Nick?

39:17.623 --> 39:19.525
- Just waiting for it.
Waiting for it.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.828
- In one, two, three...

39:22.861 --> 39:27.032
*

39:27.065 --> 39:29.568
- And it broke the stick.
[laughs]

39:29.601 --> 39:32.137
- Three. Two. One.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.840
*

39:34.873 --> 39:37.676
- Whoo!
- [laughs]

39:37.709 --> 39:39.645
- It broke the stick again!

39:39.678 --> 39:41.480
- All right, well, first off,
let's remember

39:41.513 --> 39:43.148
that the test wasn't about
breaking sticks.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.484
It was more about
how your blade reacts

39:45.517 --> 39:46.852
to being hit by that stick.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.421
*

39:49.455 --> 39:52.458
There is no damage whatsoever.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.759
This is still a razor blade.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.595
- Oh, man. Thank you.
- Nicely done.

39:56.628 --> 39:57.963
- Nick's blades performed
amazingly,

39:57.996 --> 39:59.030
but I fared a little better

39:59.064 --> 40:00.866
than I thought I was going to,

40:00.899 --> 40:03.935
so I'd really say
we're neck and neck.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.039
- The judges have made
their final decision,

40:08.073 --> 40:09.908
but before I announce that,

40:09.941 --> 40:12.010
they have comments
for both of you... Jason?

40:12.043 --> 40:15.981
- Nicholas, I liked
that your blades were Damascus.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.849
I liked the way it looked.
It cut really deep.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.985
Well-designed as a weapon.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.754
What I didn't like
was the forge-welding.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.656
You had to weld it
with a welder.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.925
But, um, they were wicked sharp.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.694
- Thanks.
- Steve.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.529
First of all,
you're to be commended

40:30.562 --> 40:32.598
that, despite the problems
you had at your home forge,

40:32.631 --> 40:34.566
you were still able
to turn a blade.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.034
I like the way
you designed your blade

40:36.067 --> 40:38.970
to resemble antlers--
very creative.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.239
The fact that it's made
from one-piece steel

40:41.272 --> 40:42.974
is also impressive.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.175
Given your setbacks, however,

40:44.209 --> 40:46.177
this is a championship round.

40:46.211 --> 40:48.213
There are visible gaps
and glue in your handle

40:48.246 --> 40:49.815
and chisel marks left

40:49.848 --> 40:51.983
on the inside edges
of the steel.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.854
- Well, you've both done
commendable work,

40:55.887 --> 40:58.023
but there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion

40:58.056 --> 40:59.591
in this competition.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.127
[dramatic music]

41:02.160 --> 41:05.130
*

41:05.163 --> 41:07.232
Nick. Congratulations.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.701
You are
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

41:09.735 --> 41:12.871
Steve, your weapons
did not make the cut.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.172
Dave will explain.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.207
- As Doug said,
I really commend you

41:16.241 --> 41:19.110
for doing what you did
on such a compressed timeline.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.211
- Thank you.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.947
- In the end, it came down to

41:21.980 --> 41:24.616
the fact that the scales
aren't quite on,

41:24.650 --> 41:26.217
there's gapping,
there's still some marks

41:26.251 --> 41:28.754
from where you cut
the steel open,

41:28.787 --> 41:29.721
and that's why
we're letting you go.

41:29.755 --> 41:31.089
- I understand.

41:31.122 --> 41:32.190
- Steve, it's that time.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.892
Please surrender your weapons.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.293
- Congratulations.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.696
I'm not surprised
at the result.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.599
There is a natural energy

41:40.632 --> 41:43.001
that guides all of us
throughout our lives,

41:43.034 --> 41:46.137
and this is how everything
naturally unfolded.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.874
Unfortunately,
it didn't go my way this time,

41:48.907 --> 41:50.542
but I'll be back.

41:50.576 --> 41:52.544
*

41:52.578 --> 41:53.879
- Nick, congratulations.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.313
You're
the "Forged in Fire" champion

41:55.346 --> 41:57.549
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

41:57.583 --> 41:59.585
How do you feel?

41:59.618 --> 42:01.587
- Pretty darn good.
- [laughs]

42:01.620 --> 42:04.222
- Awesome.
Good job, brother.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.757
- That's me.

42:05.791 --> 42:07.025
That's me.
That's Nick.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.060
That's me.
I won.

42:09.094 --> 42:12.030
I'm going to hug my wife
when I get home,

42:12.063 --> 42:14.032
and then I'm gonna hug
my kitty cat.

42:14.065 --> 42:17.068
If any of you other bladesmiths
out there

42:17.102 --> 42:19.337
are thinking about it,
I say do it.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.807
Try not to have a cold
when you do it, though.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.041
[clears throat]

42:23.074 --> 42:28.580
*
