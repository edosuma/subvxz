WEBVTT

00:14.542 --> 00:15.605
How many frogs

00:15.606 --> 00:16.667
did you have to kiss

00:16.708 --> 00:18.374
before finding your prince?

00:18.375 --> 00:19.625
I would love to have been

00:19.626 --> 00:20.874
more of, like, a whore.

00:20.875 --> 00:21.875
(stifles laugh)

00:21.876 --> 00:23.708
- Vida, are you excited
- to be a grandma?

00:23.711 --> 00:24.875
- No.
- Yes.

00:24.876 --> 00:25.875
(laughs)

00:25.876 --> 00:27.226
- You have to protect her.
- I don't.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.375
No, I don't have to do

00:28.376 --> 00:29.500
anything. She's my ex.

00:29.542 --> 00:30.875
Girl, you said that

00:30.876 --> 00:32.208
you had a sex tape about me.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.542
- I never said
- I had the sex tape.

00:33.545 --> 00:35.125
- Yes, you did.
- You said it.

00:35.167 --> 00:36.355
Shut the f... up.

00:36.356 --> 00:37.541
MJ's not a loyal friend.

00:37.542 --> 00:38.542
I'm not?

00:38.543 --> 00:39.542
MJ goes and knocks

00:39.543 --> 00:40.874
on every door she can,

00:40.875 --> 00:42.833
- trying to, like, sabotage
- what I'm doing.

00:42.875 --> 00:43.976
- Excuse me?
- Talking sh... about it.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.708
- You're a jealous,
- bitter girl.

00:45.750 --> 00:46.875
- Okay.
- Stop it.

00:46.878 --> 00:48.292
You're thin-skinned.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.750
No more. Game over.

00:52.751 --> 00:54.249
F... you. Goodbye.

00:54.250 --> 00:55.583
Good to know.

00:55.625 --> 00:56.917
For her to believe

00:56.958 --> 00:58.917
- that I would not want
- what's best for you,

00:58.920 --> 01:00.684
- And for you to believe that,
- honestly not fair.

01:00.708 --> 01:01.667
We know how close we are,

01:01.708 --> 01:03.101
- and we know
- how much we love each other.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.042
- Used to.
- If you're...

01:05.083 --> 01:06.375
After what you said?

01:06.417 --> 01:07.917
- You keep saying things
- that you're gonna regret later.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.184
- Not to me, but to her,
- and you guys are not...

01:09.208 --> 01:10.583
I'm not gonna regret it.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.018
- I promise you will,
- so let me say something.

01:12.042 --> 01:13.250
- I'm so not.
- Like, when...

01:18.250 --> 01:19.646
Um, let's take

01:19.647 --> 01:21.042
a break, guys.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.229
Tommy, it was great

01:22.230 --> 01:23.375
to see you. Vida...

01:23.417 --> 01:24.750
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.208
Same here.

01:27.417 --> 01:28.917
Okay, bye.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.208
Bye.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.291
Bye, mommy.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.458
- Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye.
- Thanks.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.125
- Bye, Adam.
- Love you. Kisses.

01:35.167 --> 01:36.726
- I would like
- some more champagne, please.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.625
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:38.628 --> 01:40.917
It is hot as f...

01:40.958 --> 01:42.434
- Let's go
- in one of the cold trailers.

01:42.458 --> 01:43.917
I wouldn't mind a stogie.

01:45.958 --> 01:47.291
I'm a little concerned.

01:47.292 --> 01:48.957
A little bit of Vida

01:48.958 --> 01:51.271
is popping out of your

01:51.272 --> 01:53.583
character this evening...

01:53.625 --> 01:54.875
F... no.

01:54.917 --> 01:56.458
- With Asa, dude.
- F... no.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.458
- What did she say, that you're
- talking sh... about her f... ing...

01:58.461 --> 01:59.809
- She said I'm
- bad-mouthing her business.

01:59.833 --> 02:01.458
- Think about how Vida
- does that to you,

02:01.461 --> 02:03.791
And how it makes you feel.

02:03.792 --> 02:04.875
I know,

02:04.876 --> 02:05.957
but you're her friend.

02:05.958 --> 02:07.375
- No, I'm not
- her friend anymore.

02:07.417 --> 02:08.476
Well, you were - at one point.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.917
You're jumping down

02:09.918 --> 02:11.333
her throat because she...

02:11.375 --> 02:12.667
Don't cut so deep that

02:12.668 --> 02:13.958
you can't heal that wound.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.334
I don't want to heal it.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.667
I want it to be over.

02:16.708 --> 02:18.354
Take a match, light

02:18.355 --> 02:20.000
the bridge, watch it burn,

02:20.042 --> 02:21.643
- and let the ashes
- flow away into the ocean.

02:21.667 --> 02:22.625
All because you said...

02:22.667 --> 02:23.959
Because

02:23.960 --> 02:25.250
she's full of sh...

02:25.292 --> 02:26.976
- Babe, I don't wanna keep
- perpetuating it,

02:27.000 --> 02:27.958
Because out of spite,

02:28.000 --> 02:29.792
- you won't be her friend
- ever again.

02:29.833 --> 02:30.833
He wasn't even here, so...

02:30.833 --> 02:31.833
- It doesn't matter.
- He knows you.

02:31.836 --> 02:33.101
- Listen, baby,
- it doesn't matter.

02:33.125 --> 02:34.083
- You're the most beautiful
- creature on this planet.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.083
Bye, I'll see you soon.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.167
And there's no reason

02:36.208 --> 02:37.750
for you ever to be that

02:37.751 --> 02:39.292
hostile towards anyone.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.500
Okay, here we go.

02:48.501 --> 02:53.667
In five, four, three, two...

02:53.708 --> 02:54.833
We're back. We have

02:54.834 --> 02:55.958
an abundance of questions

02:56.000 --> 02:57.707
from your loyal fans.

02:57.708 --> 02:59.208
- Rod from
- North Carolina said,

02:59.211 --> 03:01.226
- Mike, how many businesses
- do you have right now?

03:01.250 --> 03:02.521
I feel like you start

03:02.522 --> 03:03.792
a new company every season.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.583
How do you go from commercial

03:05.584 --> 03:07.333
real estate to selling shoes?

03:07.375 --> 03:08.792
I don't sell shoes,

03:08.793 --> 03:10.207
I manufacture shoes.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.542
And an opportunity arose,

03:11.543 --> 03:12.874
with good friends of mine

03:12.875 --> 03:14.208
- that own a factory
- in Mexico,

03:14.211 --> 03:16.042
- Actually one of the largest
- factories in Mexico,

03:16.045 --> 03:17.292
Got with me and said listen,

03:17.293 --> 03:18.541
we're doing shoes.

03:18.542 --> 03:20.875
- Let's come together and
- collaborate and make some shoes.

03:20.878 --> 03:22.541
Pretty crazy.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.226
- Yeah, things are just
- coming to fruition, man.

03:24.250 --> 03:25.313
I'm trying

03:25.314 --> 03:26.375
to build an empire,

03:26.417 --> 03:27.726
- so I decided to give
- real estate a break

03:27.750 --> 03:29.851
- And just focus on something
- that I'm passionate about,

03:29.875 --> 03:30.833
And shoes are it.

03:30.875 --> 03:31.958
Those are amazing.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.042
Those black ones?

03:33.083 --> 03:34.143
It's got the Kitson blue.

03:34.167 --> 03:35.917
- The biggest shoe size
- that you have.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.833
- So cute for buying a pair.
- I love you.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.875
I'm so down to buy a pair.

03:39.917 --> 03:41.417
- I have to assume
- you didn't know

03:41.420 --> 03:43.226
- That Kitson was about
- to go out of business.

03:43.250 --> 03:44.625
I put up a lot of money

03:44.626 --> 03:46.000
to manufacture the shoes.

03:46.042 --> 03:47.249
I gave Kitson terms

03:47.250 --> 03:48.584
where they would give me

03:48.585 --> 03:49.916
the money in 90 days.

03:49.917 --> 03:51.667
- They ordered
- 2,000 pairs of shoes

03:51.708 --> 03:53.583
- That was just
- to their specifications

03:53.625 --> 03:55.208
- With the Kitson
- blue bottoms,

03:55.250 --> 03:56.393
- And we made it
- exactly how they want it.

03:56.417 --> 03:57.417
That sucks.

03:57.458 --> 03:58.646
We got the shoes to them,

03:58.647 --> 03:59.833
and they went BK.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.188
So where can people

04:01.189 --> 04:02.500
buy your shoes now?

04:02.542 --> 04:03.917
They can go - onto my website.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.000
Very good.

04:05.042 --> 04:06.480
Mike, your very active

04:06.481 --> 04:07.916
on Instagram.

04:07.917 --> 04:09.916
We noticed a running theme

04:09.917 --> 04:11.625
of selfies

04:11.626 --> 04:13.333
with motivational captions.

04:13.375 --> 04:14.375
(all laugh)

04:14.376 --> 04:15.376
We have some here.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.124
They're so cute.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.791
Like "Your outlook on life"

04:18.792 --> 04:20.209
will determine

04:20.210 --> 04:21.624
"whether you win or lose."

04:21.625 --> 04:22.958
"Winning" - (all laugh)

04:22.961 --> 04:24.708
And "What the world needs"

04:24.709 --> 04:26.457
is more real motherf... ers

04:26.458 --> 04:27.750
"who don't bullsh..."

04:27.792 --> 04:29.291
"Dare to be honest."

04:29.292 --> 04:30.542
Yes, I did.

04:30.583 --> 04:31.854
And "Eye of the Tiger",

04:31.855 --> 04:33.124
one-track mind.

04:33.125 --> 04:35.124
I love that one.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.792
- That's a classic
- right there.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.292
(all laugh)

04:38.333 --> 04:40.042
You also end a lot

04:40.043 --> 04:41.750
of posts with â™ªwisdom.

04:41.792 --> 04:43.125
Yes.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.792
Are you trying to motivate

04:44.793 --> 04:46.417
yourself or others?

04:46.458 --> 04:47.708
You know, I must be

04:47.709 --> 04:48.957
doing something right,

04:48.958 --> 04:50.291
because I get a lot of DMs

04:50.292 --> 04:51.459
of people like just taking

04:51.460 --> 04:52.625
a page out of my book.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.083
I've made a lot of mistakes,

04:54.125 --> 04:55.604
and with mistakes and age

04:55.605 --> 04:57.083
comes wisdom,

04:57.125 --> 04:58.458
and I share what I think.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.643
- You know what
- screws me up, though?

04:59.667 --> 05:00.667
Here's the funny thing.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.730
I'll get a hundred

05:01.731 --> 05:02.792
great messages,

05:02.833 --> 05:04.000
- like "I love you,"
- blah, blah, blah,

05:04.003 --> 05:05.792
- You know,
- all, like, nice stuff.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.333
- Then you get
- that one gremlin

05:07.336 --> 05:08.583
That says one mean thing

05:08.584 --> 05:09.833
about you,

05:09.875 --> 05:11.750
- and that's the one thing
- I focus on,

05:11.792 --> 05:12.750
And it ruins my happiness.

05:12.792 --> 05:13.976
- You shouldn't read
- the comments.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.167
- You do?
- Yeah.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.333
- F... those people.
- You can't read the comments.

05:16.334 --> 05:17.351
- That's totally contrary
- to your mantras.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.018
- Yeah, but you see,
- it bothers me because...

05:19.042 --> 05:20.309
- He's a Libra. He wants
- everyone to like him.

05:20.333 --> 05:21.792
Yeah, I hate when

05:21.793 --> 05:23.250
there's confrontation.

05:23.292 --> 05:24.646
That's why you don't see me

05:24.647 --> 05:25.999
in the middle of most fights.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.125
Asa, how's

05:27.126 --> 05:28.250
the caftan business going?

05:28.292 --> 05:29.458
Really well.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.833
- Actually, Nordstrom
- contacted us, yeah, this week.

05:31.836 --> 05:33.434
- That's great.
- Thank you so much, yeah.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.479
They love it,

05:34.480 --> 05:35.499
and they wanna start

05:35.500 --> 05:37.333
- in two, three regions
- and a few stores.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.499
So it's a huge deal for us.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.667
That is a very big deal.

05:39.708 --> 05:40.833
Yeah, I'm super excited.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.167
- And what about
- Diamond Water?

05:42.208 --> 05:43.875
- Diamond Water
- is alive and well.

05:43.917 --> 05:46.041
We just expanded to Dubai.

05:46.042 --> 05:47.292
We're in Jean-Georges

05:47.293 --> 05:48.541
in the Four Seasons in Dubai,

05:48.542 --> 05:50.167
which is the only three Michelin

05:50.168 --> 05:51.792
star restaurant in Dubai.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.041
So they serve Diamond Water.

05:54.042 --> 05:57.167
Reza, stand-up is so hard.

05:57.208 --> 05:59.021
How do you just decide to

05:59.022 --> 06:00.833
jump in to stand-up comedy?

06:00.875 --> 06:02.459
I have always thought

06:02.460 --> 06:04.041
that I was funny as f...

06:04.042 --> 06:05.125
Growing up,

06:05.126 --> 06:06.207
I always thought that.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.542
- Well, we think you're funny,
- watching you on the show.

06:07.545 --> 06:08.708
Thank you.

06:08.750 --> 06:09.959
But sometimes

06:09.960 --> 06:11.167
if you're funny situationally,

06:11.208 --> 06:12.292
that doesn't mean you're

06:12.293 --> 06:13.374
gonna be funny standing up.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.375
- Absolutely, Andy.
- So true.

06:14.376 --> 06:15.375
Absolutely.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.042
Where are y'all from?

06:17.083 --> 06:19.042
- Any foreign motherf... ers
- in here?

06:19.083 --> 06:21.000
- I got the top down
- in my car,

06:21.042 --> 06:22.749
I look over to my right,

06:22.750 --> 06:23.792
and it's that f... ing

06:23.793 --> 06:24.833
bitch in the Honda.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.167
And the bitch is Chinese,

06:26.208 --> 06:28.167
- so I'm thinking the bitch
- can't even see me.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.167
Crickets.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.916
It hurts to watch.

06:31.917 --> 06:34.083
(humming)

06:34.125 --> 06:35.688
Reza's going down

06:35.689 --> 06:37.249
in a blaze of glory.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.667
It's a great combination of

06:38.668 --> 06:40.083
thinking you're funny as f...

06:40.125 --> 06:41.354
And having no f... s to give.

06:41.355 --> 06:42.582
Right.

06:42.583 --> 06:43.893
- And putting those
- two things together,

06:43.917 --> 06:45.833
It, you know, empowers me

06:45.875 --> 06:47.417
- to get on stage
- and do my thing.

06:47.458 --> 06:49.021
What did you guys think

06:49.022 --> 06:50.583
of Reza's stand-up routine?

06:50.625 --> 06:52.434
- I think Reza's hilarious,
- I think he's very witty.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.521
I think his stand-up

06:54.522 --> 06:56.583
that night was...

06:56.625 --> 06:58.518
- It seemed like the first
- night, it wasn't great.

06:58.542 --> 07:00.434
- Stand-up's literally known to
- be the hardest thing you can do,

07:00.458 --> 07:01.417
And he got out there.

07:01.458 --> 07:02.749
What I respect most

07:02.750 --> 07:03.809
- is that he didn't let it
- beat him, and he came again.

07:03.833 --> 07:04.957
That's right.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.438
Are you gonna keep

07:06.439 --> 07:07.917
pursuing the comedy thing?

07:07.958 --> 07:08.917
- Absolutely.
- Not only that,

07:08.958 --> 07:10.792
- Andy, I cannot wait
- for you guys to see.

07:10.833 --> 07:13.291
I'm now working on a project

07:13.292 --> 07:14.334
that just started

07:14.335 --> 07:15.375
a couple days ago

07:15.417 --> 07:18.042
where I'm gonna do a play

07:18.083 --> 07:19.604
where I'm gonna be, like,

07:19.605 --> 07:21.124
the Persian Madea.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.125
Literally. Blonde wig,

07:22.126 --> 07:23.125
red lipstick,

07:23.126 --> 07:24.375
titties, the whole thing.

07:24.376 --> 07:25.624
(laughs)

07:25.625 --> 07:27.042
- Oh, wow, that's funny.
- Yeah.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.104
Asa, you had your

07:29.105 --> 07:31.125
relationship art project,

07:31.167 --> 07:32.605
and it was really about

07:32.606 --> 07:34.042
relationships in every form.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.688
Yes.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.291
Oh, I love this one!

07:37.292 --> 07:38.625
I wanna take portraits

07:38.626 --> 07:39.957
of the couples around me,

07:39.958 --> 07:41.625
- and just celebrate
- being together.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.458
- It was interesting,
- because the theme

07:43.500 --> 07:44.813
Was everyone's relationship

07:44.814 --> 07:46.125
with others,

07:46.167 --> 07:48.125
- but we don't hear
- anything about yours.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.500
- Well, I included a picture
- of me and Jermaine in the show.

07:50.501 --> 07:51.501
Right.

07:51.542 --> 07:52.684
- He just doesn't
- wanna be on camera.

07:52.708 --> 07:53.750
But that doesn't mean

07:53.792 --> 07:55.500
- you can't talk about
- your relationship

07:55.542 --> 07:56.667
- Or share things
- about your relationship.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.101
- I talk about him,
- like at the project I did.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.667
- The picture
- of Jermaine and I

07:59.670 --> 08:00.834
Means that

08:00.835 --> 08:01.999
we're holding each other,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.499
looking into the future,

08:03.500 --> 08:05.417
- and that's what
- relationships are,

08:05.458 --> 08:07.438
Is that you're traveling with

08:07.439 --> 08:09.417
your partner into the future.

08:09.458 --> 08:10.708
I'm just curious.

08:10.709 --> 08:11.958
Do you guys resent it at all?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.792
Because your marriage has

08:13.793 --> 08:15.583
been under a microscope, Mike.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.583
You left Adam - at the altar.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.854
MJ, we've seen the demise of

08:19.855 --> 08:22.083
several of your relationships.

08:22.125 --> 08:24.646
Do you resent it that Asa

08:24.647 --> 08:27.167
has this line on the show?

08:27.208 --> 08:28.750
Well, I feel like

08:28.751 --> 08:30.292
I've been so open,

08:30.333 --> 08:31.938
and it does hurt to feel

08:31.939 --> 08:33.541
like someone is so guarded

08:33.542 --> 08:34.874
of so many private things.

08:34.875 --> 08:36.104
That's not fair, "guarded"

08:36.105 --> 08:37.333
of so many private things."

08:37.375 --> 08:38.875
I mean, - there's one thing

08:38.878 --> 08:40.351
- I don't have on the show
- because it's his choice.

08:40.375 --> 08:41.375
I think she's very smart...

08:41.376 --> 08:43.176
- For not having a relationship
- on the show,

08:43.208 --> 08:44.375
Because you become

08:44.376 --> 08:45.541
a reality TV couple.

08:45.542 --> 08:47.188
Well, Mike, if all of us did

08:47.189 --> 08:48.833
that, we couldn't have a show.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.042
- Andy, I'm the only one
- who's always been up front...

08:50.045 --> 08:51.184
- I'm just saying,
- she's smart.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.042
- About you know,
- certain financial things,

08:53.083 --> 08:54.375
And I'm known as

08:54.376 --> 08:55.667
the poor one in the group.

08:55.708 --> 08:57.208
- But a lot of people aren't
- real about a lot of things

08:57.211 --> 08:59.000
- Just because
- it's on camera...

08:59.042 --> 09:01.000
- What are you talking about?
- Name anyone.

09:01.042 --> 09:02.375
Babe, you don't really

09:02.376 --> 09:03.708
work in real estate.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.042
- Like, you're not real
- about that.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.042
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

09:07.045 --> 09:08.646
I actually closed real estate

09:08.647 --> 09:10.249
transactions during the season.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.417
In your building.

09:11.458 --> 09:12.934
- If something's up
- in your building, you know...

09:12.958 --> 09:15.000
- She's gotten my last two
- places to live.

09:15.042 --> 09:16.583
- And you, because
- you're on the show,

09:16.584 --> 09:17.583
And that was the connect.

09:17.584 --> 09:20.082
No. My actual scenes

09:20.083 --> 09:21.917
- closing transactions
- in real estate

09:21.920 --> 09:23.750
- Were left
- on the cutting room floor.

09:23.753 --> 09:24.813
All I'm saying...

09:24.814 --> 09:25.875
My point being,

09:25.917 --> 09:27.250
a lot of people aren't real

09:27.251 --> 09:28.582
about a lot of things,

09:28.583 --> 09:29.684
- but just because my boyfriend
- is not on the show...

09:29.708 --> 09:30.708
You think that the fact

09:30.750 --> 09:32.125
that I was a real estate agent

09:32.126 --> 09:33.500
is not real?

09:33.542 --> 09:34.684
- No, you're
- a real estate agent,

09:34.708 --> 09:36.059
- But that's not really
- how you make your money.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.417
- You make your money
- from the show.

09:37.418 --> 09:38.434
- And Asa, I respect that
- Jermaine doesn't wanna be on.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.417
I'm just saying, - like, if...

09:39.458 --> 09:40.917
So your way - of deflecting...

09:40.920 --> 09:42.230
Excuse me!

09:42.231 --> 09:43.542
Your way of deflecting

09:43.583 --> 09:45.750
the fact that I am open

09:45.751 --> 09:47.917
with my entire life,

09:47.958 --> 09:49.625
and what you're choosing

09:49.626 --> 09:51.292
to say, I'm not being real?

09:51.333 --> 09:53.042
So not twist that because he

09:53.043 --> 09:54.750
asked you where Jermaine is.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.625
- You're not being open
- about Jermaine.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.125
- I am trying to be real
- with you

09:58.167 --> 09:59.624
In a moment where I'm saying

09:59.625 --> 10:00.959
my f... ing relationship

10:00.960 --> 10:02.291
is wide open.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.605
Filet of fish, honey.

10:03.606 --> 10:04.917
You are not doing that.

10:04.958 --> 10:06.125
- Don't come back
- and tell me that.

10:06.126 --> 10:07.125
- I mean,
- you're pretty selective.

10:07.126 --> 10:08.125
- You're pretty selective,
- but...

10:08.126 --> 10:09.126
Oh, I am wide open.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.292
Bring anything.

10:10.293 --> 10:11.417
What else you got? Go ahead.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.625
- I don't want to talk
- to you like this.

10:12.628 --> 10:13.809
- Go ahead, bring it.
- Bring it.

10:13.833 --> 10:14.958
Because I don't have

10:14.959 --> 10:16.083
anything to hide!

10:18.792 --> 10:19.917
[Voiceover] Coming up...

10:19.958 --> 10:20.958
- You're being dramatic
- right now.

10:20.961 --> 10:22.458
No, you're being - an asshole.

10:22.461 --> 10:23.750
Do you know what

10:23.751 --> 10:25.042
it does to my credibility

10:25.083 --> 10:26.042
when one of my friends...

10:26.083 --> 10:27.750
What about my credibility?

10:27.792 --> 10:29.458
- What the f...?
- Wait, please!

10:29.500 --> 10:30.709
I wanna walk away,

10:30.710 --> 10:31.917
just 'cause I'm crying.

10:37.042 --> 10:38.000
What else you got?

10:38.042 --> 10:39.184
- Go ahead, go ahead,
- bring it.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.434
- I don't wanna talk
- to you like this.

10:40.458 --> 10:41.458
Bring it. Bring it.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.684
- Because I don't have
- anything to hide!

10:42.708 --> 10:43.854
You do, but I understand

10:43.855 --> 10:44.999
the resentment,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.375
and I wish it wasn't so,

10:46.376 --> 10:47.750
but it's not my choice.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.146
Do you feel like you're

10:49.147 --> 10:50.499
being as open as the others

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
- about your life
- being on here?

10:51.503 --> 10:53.417
- Absolutely.
- Do the others agree?

10:53.458 --> 10:54.768
- I'd love to hear
- whoever disagrees.

10:54.792 --> 10:55.851
- I wanna hear what
- I'm not being open about.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.188
I'd love to hear

10:57.189 --> 10:58.499
about my fake closings.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.458
- You're being dramatic
- right now.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.750
No, you're being - an asshole.

11:00.792 --> 11:01.750
Come on, you're acting.

11:01.792 --> 11:02.833
- Yeah.
- Easy.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.458
- No.
- GG, what do you think?

11:04.500 --> 11:06.833
- Her relationship
- is gonna be the longest to last

11:06.836 --> 11:08.063
Because of the fact that

11:08.064 --> 11:09.292
she hasn't brought it on TV.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.833
- Because so much sh...
- Happens

11:10.836 --> 11:11.979
When you bring

11:11.980 --> 11:13.125
your relationship on TV.

11:13.167 --> 11:14.708
- If you marry Jermaine
- and you have a child,

11:14.711 --> 11:15.750
Will you be able

11:15.751 --> 11:16.792
to share it on the show?

11:16.833 --> 11:19.125
Maybe.

11:19.167 --> 11:21.042
Okay, I wanna move on.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.271
Maria from Leesburg, Virginia,

11:23.272 --> 11:25.458
said... we got this a lot...

11:25.500 --> 11:26.917
"GG and Shervin, you know,"

11:26.918 --> 11:28.333
why don't you guys date?

11:28.375 --> 11:29.541
"You can see how Shervin"

11:29.542 --> 11:30.959
"genuinely likes Golnesa"

11:30.960 --> 11:32.374
and cares for her.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.042
GG seems comfortable with him,

11:34.043 --> 11:35.707
"and can be herself."

11:35.708 --> 11:37.726
- I know you like nuts
- in your mouth. You want some?

11:37.750 --> 11:38.896
Uh, can you warm them up

11:38.897 --> 11:40.041
the way I really like them?

11:40.042 --> 11:41.708
- No, no, I ain't
- gonna do that.

11:41.711 --> 11:42.833
Don't pull on my hair.

11:42.875 --> 11:45.792
Oh, my God.

11:45.833 --> 11:47.041
Oh, my God.

11:47.042 --> 11:48.375
- Hi, you wanna hug it out,
- bitch?

11:48.378 --> 11:49.708
I'm happy.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.167
Now let me ask you this.

11:51.208 --> 11:52.875
- The two of you
- have never hooked up?

11:52.876 --> 11:53.875
- No.
- No.

11:53.876 --> 11:54.875
- Come on.
- Never.

11:54.878 --> 11:56.667
- Zero.
- Just because we're friends

11:56.708 --> 11:58.333
- Doesn't mean
- we have to have sex.

11:58.375 --> 11:59.438
There's a close

11:59.439 --> 12:00.500
relationship,

12:00.542 --> 12:02.393
- but it's a different kind
- of closeness, you know?

12:02.417 --> 12:04.375
- It's like I genuinely care
- about Golnesa,

12:04.417 --> 12:06.601
- But I genuinely care that
- she's happy, that she's good,

12:06.625 --> 12:08.104
That, you know, she's in

12:08.105 --> 12:09.583
a good place, and vice-versa.

12:09.625 --> 12:10.771
Shervin, this year,

12:10.772 --> 12:11.916
the rest of the group

12:11.917 --> 12:13.417
accused you

12:13.418 --> 12:14.916
of enabling Golnesa.

12:14.917 --> 12:16.708
- What's the difference
- between enabling

12:16.750 --> 12:17.833
And being a good friend?

12:17.875 --> 12:19.583
- Actually, Andy,
- there's a very fine line,

12:19.586 --> 12:21.250
And when I first heard that,

12:21.251 --> 12:22.916
I was very resistant.

12:22.917 --> 12:24.917
- I'm like,
- I'm absolutely not, you know.

12:24.920 --> 12:25.959
Well, you go out with her

12:25.960 --> 12:27.000
drinking and stuff.

12:27.042 --> 12:28.601
- And I'm like, yeah,
- and in my opinion,

12:28.625 --> 12:29.729
Better me go

12:29.730 --> 12:30.833
than me not be there,

12:30.875 --> 12:32.333
- so I can keep an eye
- on her, too.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.729
But I was explained again

12:34.730 --> 12:37.083
and again and again,

12:37.125 --> 12:38.625
and I did realize that, hey, I'm

12:38.626 --> 12:40.124
crossing that line sometimes.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.417
Sometimes I'm making it

12:41.418 --> 12:42.708
a little too okay

12:42.750 --> 12:43.917
to go a little too far.

12:43.958 --> 12:45.957
Time to turn up!

12:45.958 --> 12:47.375
Shervin and I just have

12:47.376 --> 12:48.791
a lot of fun together.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.458
Partying, drinking.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.917
I want some alcohol.

12:51.958 --> 12:53.188
I've seen her struggles,

12:53.189 --> 12:54.417
and I'm worried about her.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.042
- She's getting
- worse and worse,

12:56.083 --> 12:57.792
- And I really, really
- don't want it

12:57.833 --> 12:59.021
To get to that last,

12:59.022 --> 13:00.208
dark place.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.542
Aah!

13:01.583 --> 13:02.875
I don't...

13:02.917 --> 13:04.500
"She has nothing else"

13:04.501 --> 13:06.083
going on in her life.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.417
"She has no job,"

13:07.418 --> 13:08.708
no boyfriend.

13:08.750 --> 13:09.938
"She wakes up at 1:30"

13:09.939 --> 13:11.124
in the afternoon,

13:11.125 --> 13:13.042
"strategizes until 5:00 P.M."

13:13.043 --> 13:14.957
about how to start some drama,

13:14.958 --> 13:16.375
goes out and gets drunk

13:16.376 --> 13:17.792
"until the next day."

13:17.833 --> 13:18.792
- Hey, homie,
- you don't have to quote.

13:18.833 --> 13:19.833
I'm quoting you.

13:19.875 --> 13:20.958
You're quoting Shervin?

13:21.000 --> 13:21.958
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
- but no need to quote me.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.625
He said that on the show?

13:23.667 --> 13:25.832
No, I'm not... no, no, no.

13:25.833 --> 13:26.917
I'm saying this

13:26.918 --> 13:27.999
out loud to say...

13:28.000 --> 13:29.084
For her.

13:29.085 --> 13:30.167
Yeah, this isn't for you.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.271
You said it. That was

13:31.272 --> 13:32.333
the one time I said,

13:32.375 --> 13:33.333
- oh, my God,
- I sent you a text message.

13:33.375 --> 13:34.500
I did, and...

13:34.542 --> 13:35.667
Finally being real, like

13:35.668 --> 13:36.792
not going with the flow.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.601
- Not being real because
- he's putting me down?

13:38.625 --> 13:39.667
No, because...

13:39.708 --> 13:40.771
I don't wake up at 1:00

13:40.772 --> 13:41.833
in the afternoon.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.250
I'm up at 7:30, okay?

13:43.251 --> 13:44.625
I'm up probably earlier

13:44.667 --> 13:46.309
- than most of these people
- sitting here, always,

13:46.333 --> 13:47.958
- And that's been me...
- I don't care

13:48.000 --> 13:49.351
- If I was out getting drunk
- the night before.

13:49.375 --> 13:50.958
So that's a little bit...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.101
- Merce, what are you
- telling me about her?

13:52.125 --> 13:53.500
- In the morning,
- she wakes up,

13:53.501 --> 13:54.601
Yeah, whenever we travel...

13:54.625 --> 13:56.333
- What did you
- tell me about her?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.833
You wake up... me and you,

13:57.834 --> 13:59.332
we all wake up super early.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.173
- Then you take a pill,
- you go back to sleep,

14:01.208 --> 14:03.143
- You wake up drowsy,
- and then we start our day.

14:03.167 --> 14:04.458
I don't wake up drowsy,

14:04.500 --> 14:05.851
- 'cause the pill I take
- is for my nausea.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.559
- Yes, keep going.
- Tell me about my pills.

14:07.583 --> 14:09.383
- I just finished it.
- Yeah. Oh, that was it.

14:09.417 --> 14:11.042
- You're turnt. I don't know
- what's up with you.

14:11.045 --> 14:12.707
Please don't turn out...

14:12.708 --> 14:14.184
- I don't know
- what's going on with you.

14:14.208 --> 14:15.226
- You wanna keep that
- over there,

14:15.250 --> 14:16.374
Please keep it over there.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.375
- I haven't done
- anything to you.

14:17.376 --> 14:18.375
I didn't say you did, - but...

14:18.378 --> 14:19.667
Please don't turn on me.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.000
I'm...

14:21.042 --> 14:23.500
- Don't turn on me.
- I haven't done anything to you.

14:23.542 --> 14:24.708
- There's no reason
- you have to turn on me.

14:24.711 --> 14:25.809
- So you feel that I'm
- turning on you right now?

14:25.833 --> 14:27.500
- I think
- the way you talk to me

14:27.542 --> 14:28.667
Is very rude right now.

14:28.708 --> 14:30.354
Okay, I'll take that.

14:30.355 --> 14:32.000
I'll note that.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.000
Thank you.

14:33.042 --> 14:34.059
By the way, what I said,

14:34.083 --> 14:35.708
- I still stand by it
- at that time.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.167
100% that was her.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.125
- I'll tell you,
- the Golnesa today,

14:39.167 --> 14:41.042
- Especially watching
- these episodes,

14:41.083 --> 14:42.582
She's in a different place.

14:42.583 --> 14:43.896
Rachel from St. Petersburg,

14:43.897 --> 14:45.208
Florida, said,

14:45.250 --> 14:46.417
"Shervin, are you scared"

14:46.418 --> 14:47.582
GG may get into trouble

14:47.583 --> 14:48.833
or hurt herself if you're

14:48.834 --> 14:50.082
"not there to protect her?"

14:50.083 --> 14:51.250
- Is that why you hang out
- with her so much?

14:51.251 --> 14:52.268
There was definitely - a time

14:52.292 --> 14:53.355
Where I felt like

14:53.356 --> 14:54.416
if I wasn't there,

14:54.417 --> 14:55.833
- something's
- gonna happen to her.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.250
- I'm gonna
- have to bail her out,

14:57.292 --> 14:58.813
She's gonna hurt somebody,

14:58.814 --> 15:00.333
or she's gonna hurt herself.

15:00.375 --> 15:01.667
I don't feel that today.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.167
You don't?

15:03.208 --> 15:05.268
- I feel like she's come
- a long way and I'm proud of her.

15:05.292 --> 15:07.438
MJ, is Shervin a calm,

15:07.439 --> 15:09.582
level-headed peacemaker,

15:09.583 --> 15:11.417
- or is there something
- we're not seeing?

15:11.420 --> 15:12.667
He's got a wild hair.

15:12.668 --> 15:13.916
He's like an onion.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.000
He's like an onion.

15:15.042 --> 15:16.208
There's a lot going on

15:16.250 --> 15:17.250
underneath

15:17.251 --> 15:18.250
those first few layers.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.667
Why do you play peacemaker

15:19.668 --> 15:21.083
in the group?

15:21.125 --> 15:23.393
- You know, when I was younger,
- I was really hot-headed,

15:23.417 --> 15:25.292
- And I learned the hard way
- to cool off.

15:25.333 --> 15:26.396
Come on, now,

15:26.397 --> 15:27.457
let's keep it real.

15:27.458 --> 15:28.625
- I'm pretty... I've tried keeping
- things pretty neutral.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.791
Let's keep it real.

15:29.792 --> 15:31.938
Everyone knows

15:31.939 --> 15:34.083
that playing a certain role

15:34.125 --> 15:35.542
- makes you look good
- in the end,

15:35.583 --> 15:37.458
- And people care
- what fans think.

15:37.461 --> 15:38.624
So if you come across...

15:38.625 --> 15:39.792
So you think he's trying

15:39.793 --> 15:40.957
to look better for TV?

15:40.958 --> 15:41.958
Absolutely, he's trying...

15:41.959 --> 15:43.458
- I mean, who doesn't
- wanna look good?

15:43.461 --> 15:44.976
- Of course, but what I do
- outside of TV...

15:45.000 --> 15:46.313
Sherv, I know how you are

15:46.314 --> 15:47.624
when you go out,

15:47.625 --> 15:48.792
and you're... you know,

15:48.793 --> 15:49.957
you're up in the mix.

15:49.958 --> 15:51.708
- You're not the peacemaker
- when you're...

15:51.750 --> 15:52.854
Listen, I've got

15:52.855 --> 15:53.958
plenty of situations...

15:54.000 --> 15:55.292
- No, definitely
- I'm a peacemaker.

15:55.295 --> 15:56.957
Do I like to have fun,

15:56.958 --> 15:57.958
- do I turn up when
- we're filming and I'm...

15:57.959 --> 15:58.917
We don't see that at all.

15:58.958 --> 15:59.958
I cool off a little bit.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.083
We don't see that,

16:01.125 --> 16:02.309
- because you wanna play
- a certain...

16:02.333 --> 16:03.563
Are you restraining it

16:03.564 --> 16:04.791
for the cameras?

16:04.792 --> 16:05.792
- I'm the guy
- that breaks it up.

16:05.795 --> 16:06.833
- You wanna show
- a certain face...

16:06.836 --> 16:08.101
- Well, he popped off
- and got in my face...

16:08.125 --> 16:09.167
When you're on camera.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.563
When he had enough,

16:10.564 --> 16:11.917
he had enough.

16:11.958 --> 16:12.917
It takes a while, I guess.

16:12.958 --> 16:14.458
- I mean,
- he definitely has, like,

16:14.500 --> 16:15.667
Has to be

16:15.668 --> 16:16.832
little Mr. Perfect.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.396
But what I'm saying is Sherv

16:18.397 --> 16:19.958
wants to look squeaky-clean,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
and it's a great thing.

16:21.042 --> 16:22.105
I wish

16:22.106 --> 16:23.166
I could be like Sherv.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.375
Maureen from Philadelphia

16:24.376 --> 16:25.583
kind of...

16:25.625 --> 16:26.959
F... you. This question

16:26.960 --> 16:28.292
is lame as f...,

16:28.333 --> 16:30.167
- but go ahead
- and read it, Andy.

16:30.168 --> 16:31.168
Why...

16:31.208 --> 16:33.000
- Maureen wants to know,
- Reza, every season...

16:33.003 --> 16:34.143
- Why, are you reading
- my cards?

16:34.167 --> 16:35.459
Yeah, I read

16:35.460 --> 16:36.750
your f... ing questions.

16:36.792 --> 16:37.855
It's awkward.

16:37.856 --> 16:38.917
(all laugh)

16:38.958 --> 16:40.396
That was amazing, dude.

16:40.397 --> 16:41.833
I love you.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.351
- What's the question?
- I wanna know.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.500
It's interesting.

16:44.542 --> 16:45.730
Maureen from Philadelphia

16:45.731 --> 16:46.917
said, "Asa",

16:47.000 --> 16:49.396
"we've all watched Reza"

16:49.397 --> 16:51.792
turn on a friend each season.

16:51.833 --> 16:53.646
"First, MJ was an addict,"

16:53.647 --> 16:55.458
Mike a bad friend,

16:55.500 --> 16:57.438
"Lilly was fake,"

16:57.439 --> 16:59.374
and now GG is not sick.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.292
- "You do realize
- you're the only one left.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.374
"Are you nervous?"

17:02.375 --> 17:03.625
- Not at all.
- No?

17:03.667 --> 17:04.708
I'm not nervous - at all, no.

17:04.711 --> 17:06.000
Shervin, are you next?

17:06.042 --> 17:07.542
- I mean, if it's not her...
- No, I'm just kidding.

17:07.543 --> 17:08.542
I'm not nervous.

17:08.543 --> 17:09.708
- I don't think
- it has anything to do

17:09.711 --> 17:10.875
With him taking turns

17:10.876 --> 17:12.041
going through people.

17:12.042 --> 17:13.958
- I think that
- if he's got a legitimate beef

17:14.000 --> 17:15.334
Or some kind of issue with

17:15.335 --> 17:16.667
somebody, he brings it up.

17:16.708 --> 17:18.000
Golnesa, - what do you think?

17:18.042 --> 17:20.375
- I think Reza tried
- to make his attempt this season

17:20.417 --> 17:21.646
To go after Shervin,

17:21.647 --> 17:22.874
and it failed.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.438
He knows it's true, so don't

17:24.439 --> 17:26.000
sit back and say it's not.

17:26.042 --> 17:27.188
I'll tell you what

17:27.189 --> 17:28.351
I know... what I know about...

17:28.375 --> 17:30.417
- No, don't be so peachy
- and clean, because you're not.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.749
So just be honest about it.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.667
- The stuff that you've
- talked to me about,

17:33.708 --> 17:35.000
That you've said, say it.

17:35.042 --> 17:36.250
This is the place.

17:36.292 --> 17:37.875
- I'm not gonna
- only be the bad guy.

17:37.917 --> 17:38.934
- She's not gonna
- only be the bad guy.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.434
- We're, I mean...
- Hey, can I say it?

17:40.458 --> 17:41.518
- Yes, don't yell at me,
- though.

17:41.542 --> 17:42.917
- Okay, stop talking.
- Go ahead. Say it.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.480
So Reza and Asa didn't want me

17:44.481 --> 17:46.042
to come to the camping trip,

17:46.083 --> 17:47.684
- and Golnesa
- was pretty livid about it.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.667
- Her response was
- if Shervin doesn't go,

17:49.708 --> 17:51.146
I'm not gonna go, and she

17:51.147 --> 17:52.583
said she stood up for me.

17:52.625 --> 17:53.688
Do you think they didn't

17:53.689 --> 17:54.749
want you on the show?

17:54.750 --> 17:56.393
- I think that there's
- a natural resistance

17:56.417 --> 17:58.250
- To a new...
- To a newcomer.

17:58.292 --> 17:59.438
To a newcomer.

17:59.439 --> 18:00.583
Can I comment?

18:02.417 --> 18:03.875
- [Voiceover]
- Coming up next...

18:03.917 --> 18:05.250
- Girl talk is different
- than guy talk.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.251
It's a little sexist.

18:06.292 --> 18:08.083
- I don't wanna be labeled
- as a sexist.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.750
- I don't think
- you respect women.

18:09.753 --> 18:10.833
I love women.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.667
But do you respect them?

18:20.750 --> 18:21.938
I think that there's

18:21.939 --> 18:23.124
a natural resistance

18:23.125 --> 18:24.292
- to a new...
- To a newcomer.

18:24.293 --> 18:25.293
To the newcomer.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.458
- Can I comment?
- Yes.

18:26.461 --> 18:28.042
I absolutely

18:28.043 --> 18:29.625
didn't want Shervin to come,

18:29.667 --> 18:31.542
- and it has nothing to do
- with Shervin

18:31.583 --> 18:33.250
Except for the fact

18:33.251 --> 18:34.917
that Shervin enables her,

18:34.958 --> 18:36.271
and she uses him

18:36.272 --> 18:37.583
as a crutch,

18:37.625 --> 18:38.958
- and we were trying
- to do an intervention.

18:38.961 --> 18:40.271
And I was thinking

18:40.272 --> 18:41.583
if Shervin is there,

18:41.625 --> 18:43.957
he's gonna get in the way.

18:43.958 --> 18:45.309
- He's gonna be that crutch
- for her.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.292
- It was at a time
- when she needed to hear

18:47.295 --> 18:48.875
Some real facts and not

18:48.876 --> 18:50.457
have you stand up for her.

18:50.458 --> 18:51.999
She needed tough love.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Without being,

18:53.001 --> 18:54.001
you know, attacked

18:54.042 --> 18:55.434
- because I'm protecting her
- or something,

18:55.458 --> 18:56.875
I'm really not, but in all

18:56.876 --> 18:58.292
fairness to all five of you,

18:58.333 --> 18:59.833
- including her,
- including you two,

18:59.836 --> 19:01.667
- You guys give a lot
- in this thing.

19:01.670 --> 19:02.917
You have for five years,

19:02.918 --> 19:04.166
you continue to do so,

19:04.167 --> 19:05.334
and hey, somebody

19:05.335 --> 19:06.499
just walking in the door

19:06.500 --> 19:07.500
is not fair to do that.

19:07.501 --> 19:08.601
- It had nothing
- to do with that.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.000
- That has nothing
- to do with it for...

19:10.003 --> 19:11.333
- I would do the same.
- I would be somewhat resistant

19:11.334 --> 19:12.333
And make whoever comes in...

19:12.333 --> 19:13.333
- It has nothing
- to do with that.

19:13.334 --> 19:14.333
- That's not what it is
- at all.

19:14.336 --> 19:16.292
- This whole thing
- about new people,

19:16.333 --> 19:17.476
- All the new people
- on the show,

19:17.500 --> 19:19.184
- Andy, whether it was Asa,
- Asifa, or Lilly,

19:19.208 --> 19:21.128
- I was the person
- who was always open to them.

19:21.167 --> 19:22.583
One of the only people.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.146
Okay, I think that's as far

19:24.147 --> 19:25.667
as we're gonna get on this.

19:25.708 --> 19:27.354
Reza, Mike, you were friends,

19:27.355 --> 19:28.999
then you weren't,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.063
now you're friends again.

19:30.064 --> 19:31.125
Yes.

19:31.167 --> 19:32.934
- What's different
- about your friendship now?

19:32.958 --> 19:34.729
Part of it, unfortunately,

19:34.730 --> 19:36.500
is his marital status.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.584
I was gonna be cool

19:38.585 --> 19:40.625
if Jessica was in or out.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.188
I'm not gonna lie. It's easier

19:42.189 --> 19:43.708
being friends with Mike

19:43.750 --> 19:44.854
when there

19:44.855 --> 19:45.958
isn't someone around

19:46.000 --> 19:47.021
who we know

19:47.022 --> 19:48.042
doesn't like any of us.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.374
She said, you know,

19:49.375 --> 19:50.459
she doesn't give a sh...

19:50.460 --> 19:51.542
About any of us.

19:51.583 --> 19:52.833
So it's been easier.

19:52.875 --> 19:53.959
And I love him, and he's

19:53.960 --> 19:55.041
been going through sh...,

19:55.042 --> 19:56.271
and I wanna be there

19:56.272 --> 19:57.500
for him.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.125
And we cleared the air.

19:59.167 --> 20:01.708
- If anyone's had a real friend,
- you have ups and downs.

20:01.711 --> 20:03.000
Mike, me and you

20:03.001 --> 20:04.292
can take over Beverly Hills.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.875
- (laughs)
- Seriously.

20:05.878 --> 20:07.041
I wanted to help him out.

20:07.042 --> 20:08.875
- I asked him
- to partner up with me.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.833
- Reza and I
- moved into a new office.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.184
- It's gonna put us
- over the top.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.707
I smell money.

20:13.708 --> 20:14.874
It turned out to be

20:14.875 --> 20:16.917
- one of the biggest mistakes
- I'd ever made.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.917
- After several weeks
- of us not talking,

20:18.920 --> 20:20.083
- Instead of you reaching out
- to me to say hey, Mike...

20:20.086 --> 20:22.083
- Reaching out to you?
- For what?

20:22.084 --> 20:23.084
You know what you are?

20:23.125 --> 20:24.333
You're a back-stabber,

20:24.375 --> 20:25.521
you're a traitor,

20:25.522 --> 20:26.667
you're not a true friend.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.083
- Mike was not willing
- to do the work,

20:28.086 --> 20:29.833
And he didn't acknowledge

20:29.834 --> 20:31.582
any responsibility.

20:31.583 --> 20:32.583
You're a f... and a

20:32.584 --> 20:33.583
f... piece of s...

20:33.584 --> 20:35.082
Okay? So f... you.

20:35.083 --> 20:36.750
- F... yourself.
- No, f... you,

20:36.792 --> 20:38.500
You're a f... ing traitor.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.125
If you are

20:40.126 --> 20:41.708
a fair-weather friend,

20:41.750 --> 20:43.082
you let the smallest things

20:43.083 --> 20:44.583
break that bond

20:44.584 --> 20:46.082
that you have.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.375
And me and Reza have been

20:47.376 --> 20:48.667
through the f... ing wringer.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.583
- Let me tell you,
- it's my fault.

20:50.586 --> 20:52.082
And I f... ing realized

20:52.083 --> 20:53.542
that I f... ed everything up,

20:53.543 --> 20:55.000
and I take full blame.

20:55.042 --> 20:56.042
I love you, man.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.708
- No, no,
- I need more than that.

20:57.750 --> 20:58.771
F... that.

20:58.772 --> 20:59.791
Put that down.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.105
I came to the f... ing

21:01.106 --> 21:02.417
realization, I had an epiphany.

21:02.458 --> 21:03.708
I cannot tell you

21:03.709 --> 21:04.958
how happy I am

21:05.000 --> 21:06.917
- to have Mike
- back in my life.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.167
I felt a void.

21:08.168 --> 21:09.375
I don't have a brother.

21:09.417 --> 21:10.875
What's going on?

21:10.917 --> 21:12.042
- You good?
- You look good.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.250
You do, too, bro.

21:13.292 --> 21:15.292
- It's like having a death
- in your family.

21:15.295 --> 21:17.334
But luckily for me, he was

21:17.335 --> 21:19.375
resurrected from the grave.

21:19.417 --> 21:20.976
- I love you, Mike,
- and I'll talk to you later.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.625
- Love you, bro.
- Bye.

21:22.628 --> 21:24.459
He is like my brother.

21:24.460 --> 21:26.291
He's like my confidant.

21:26.292 --> 21:27.624
JC from Indiana said,

21:27.625 --> 21:29.104
"Reza, how are you able to be"

21:29.105 --> 21:30.583
so loving and supportive of Mike

21:30.625 --> 21:32.792
- after he lied to you
- "for so long about the cheating?"

21:32.795 --> 21:34.105
Mike's heart is pure.

21:34.106 --> 21:35.417
Again about this lying.

21:35.458 --> 21:36.604
Can we... I just wanna say

21:36.605 --> 21:37.750
something.

21:37.792 --> 21:39.333
- Please address the lying.
- Can I just say something?

21:39.334 --> 21:40.333
- Yeah, yeah,
- please address this.

21:40.336 --> 21:41.499
He asked me.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.709
Andy, I never cared

21:43.710 --> 21:45.917
what it was that was going on.

21:45.958 --> 21:48.458
I just wanted him to not

21:48.459 --> 21:50.958
be worried to tell me stuff.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.500
I wasn't gonna judge him

21:52.501 --> 21:54.000
for what was going on.

21:54.042 --> 21:55.000
- You just wanted him
- to be honest.

21:55.042 --> 21:56.000
- I wanted him
- to keep it real.

21:56.042 --> 21:57.500
Mike has this thing

21:57.542 --> 21:59.188
that he doesn't wanna lose

21:59.189 --> 22:00.832
his luster,

22:00.833 --> 22:01.833
- and I always said this
- to him.

22:01.836 --> 22:03.518
- When he was
- going through it with Jessica,

22:03.542 --> 22:05.063
He was hoping he would

22:05.064 --> 22:06.583
have the sh... wrapped up

22:06.625 --> 22:08.500
- before had had to tell us.
- Right.

22:08.542 --> 22:10.980
So his heart is pure gold,

22:10.981 --> 22:13.417
and he was trying to save face.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.729
And when I remember

22:14.730 --> 22:16.000
how pure his heart is,

22:16.042 --> 22:17.438
it's easy to look over

22:17.439 --> 22:18.832
whatever it was

22:18.833 --> 22:20.667
- that he wasn't offering up
- at the time.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.208
- Annette
- from New Jersey said,

22:22.250 --> 22:23.729
"MJ, why did you spend"

22:23.730 --> 22:25.207
so much time mad at Mike

22:25.208 --> 22:26.458
for not discussing

22:26.459 --> 22:27.707
"his marital problems?"

22:27.708 --> 22:28.833
You've got

22:28.834 --> 22:29.958
a lot going on in your life,

22:30.000 --> 22:31.292
and you keep a secret...

22:31.333 --> 22:32.438
I'm gonna share it

22:32.439 --> 22:33.541
on my terms.

22:33.542 --> 22:35.542
- I'm gonna leave, you guys.
- Thank you very much.

22:35.545 --> 22:37.143
- Here we go with
- the aggressiveness again.

22:37.167 --> 22:38.707
I speak my mind.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.309
- Don't speak your mind to me.
- No problem.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.771
How can I be your friend if

22:41.772 --> 22:43.208
I don't know what motivates you

22:43.250 --> 22:45.207
or what your issues are?

22:45.208 --> 22:46.500
I started to miss him

22:46.501 --> 22:47.792
so long ago

22:47.833 --> 22:49.854
that by the time I was

22:49.855 --> 22:51.874
showing my mad at him...

22:51.875 --> 22:53.208
- There was a lot
- of bottled-up anger.

22:53.211 --> 22:54.541
And then I felt like

22:54.542 --> 22:56.708
- it was spinning out of control
- with his marriage,

22:56.711 --> 22:58.707
And I wanted to jump in.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.125
But not just by myself,

23:00.126 --> 23:01.541
but with everyone.

23:01.542 --> 23:03.000
Mike, what do you think?

23:03.042 --> 23:05.709
I think that she just pries

23:05.710 --> 23:08.375
a little too hard

23:08.417 --> 23:09.917
into situations that aren't

23:09.918 --> 23:11.416
necessarily any of her business.

23:11.417 --> 23:12.896
His wife left him.

23:12.897 --> 23:14.375
His wife left him.

23:14.417 --> 23:15.851
- His wife left him.
- I'm gonna f... ing kill MJ.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.500
MJ, MJ.

23:17.542 --> 23:19.250
- What?
- Shut up.

23:19.253 --> 23:21.582
Focus on me.

23:21.583 --> 23:22.833
I get she loves me

23:22.834 --> 23:24.082
and I get she wants to know

23:24.083 --> 23:25.583
- and I get that
- we're brother and sister,

23:25.586 --> 23:27.250
But you have to allow me

23:27.251 --> 23:28.916
to feel comfortable

23:28.917 --> 23:31.249
in wanting to tell you.

23:31.250 --> 23:32.518
- You can't f... ing
- drag it out of me,

23:32.542 --> 23:34.250
- And it seems like you're
- always trying to do that.

23:34.253 --> 23:36.125
And I'm like, dude,

23:36.126 --> 23:38.000
just let me get my bearings,

23:38.042 --> 23:39.268
- and then I'll tell you
- when I feel comfortable

23:39.292 --> 23:40.250
And I feel it's right.

23:40.292 --> 23:41.917
- But can I ask you
- a question?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.605
What's so different from what

23:43.606 --> 23:45.291
she's doing and what he's doing?

23:45.292 --> 23:47.583
- You're okay with him,
- but you're not okay with her.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.042
She doesn't call your wife.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.104
She wasn't calling

23:50.105 --> 23:51.124
your wife, doing that.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.208
I wanna have a talk

23:52.250 --> 23:53.438
and knock some f... ing

23:53.439 --> 23:54.624
sense into his head,

23:54.625 --> 23:55.917
because I'm worried

23:55.918 --> 23:57.208
he's f... ing up

23:57.250 --> 23:58.624
and he's gonna lose you.

23:58.625 --> 24:00.125
- What was the difference
- in that?

24:00.167 --> 24:01.393
- Okay, so I'll answer.
- That's a great question.

24:01.417 --> 24:04.500
There's a difference

24:04.501 --> 24:07.583
between a man-to-man bond

24:07.625 --> 24:08.583
than a man and a woman.

24:08.625 --> 24:10.417
Certain things, a woman,

24:10.458 --> 24:11.976
- her perception
- is different than a man.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.063
When I came to him

24:13.064 --> 24:14.125
is because I felt like

24:14.167 --> 24:16.063
he was gonna give me

24:16.064 --> 24:17.957
subjective, good insight, and...

24:17.958 --> 24:19.542
Which time?

24:19.583 --> 24:20.809
- Because the third,
- fourth time,

24:20.833 --> 24:21.893
- You were livid,
- you were raging.

24:21.917 --> 24:22.917
I was.

24:22.958 --> 24:23.917
Don't call my wife - anymore.

24:23.958 --> 24:25.792
- Mike...
- No, you're a f...

24:25.795 --> 24:27.083
I'm furious, dude.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.833
- Mike, but it's not good
- when you're furious.

24:28.836 --> 24:30.833
- No one wins
- when you're furious.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.333
I'm packing - and I'm leaving.

24:32.336 --> 24:34.667
I was, because sometimes,

24:34.668 --> 24:37.000
like MJ, Reza oversteps.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.500
- But we have
- a different bond.

24:38.503 --> 24:40.333
- It's this...
- I can't explain it.

24:40.336 --> 24:41.684
- So it's the relationship
- dynamic.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.000
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.809
- Yeah, it's a little sexist.
- Let me address this,

24:44.833 --> 24:46.476
- Because I don't wanna
- be labeled as a sexist.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.000
- Girl talk is different
- than guy talk.

24:48.003 --> 24:49.125
That's just the way it is.

24:49.126 --> 24:50.250
That's not being sexist.

24:50.292 --> 24:51.250
- Can I be honest?
- Yes, absolutely.

24:51.292 --> 24:52.250
- I don't think
- you respect women,

24:52.292 --> 24:53.309
- And that's why
- I felt offended.

24:53.333 --> 24:55.083
- You couldn't be
- further from...

24:55.125 --> 24:56.750
- I love women,
- a little too much.

24:56.792 --> 24:57.792
But I think...

24:57.833 --> 24:59.000
- And that's why
- I stick up for you,

24:59.003 --> 25:00.500
- And that's why
- I've never bad-mouthed you.

25:00.503 --> 25:02.143
- You love them,
- but do you respect them?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.750
Absolutely. I came from

25:03.751 --> 25:05.332
a woman that I f... ing adore.

25:05.333 --> 25:06.833
- She's been my mother
- and my father.

25:06.836 --> 25:08.188
She's been the person who

25:08.189 --> 25:09.542
I respect the most in the world.

25:09.583 --> 25:11.333
- So I carry that respect
- with all women.

25:11.375 --> 25:12.625
I think Mike

25:12.626 --> 25:13.874
just feels closer to guys.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.375
- I don't think
- it's a sexist thing.

25:15.417 --> 25:16.476
- But some people
- are that way.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.458
- Yeah, totally,
- and that hurts me.

25:17.500 --> 25:18.500
But that can hurt me.

25:18.542 --> 25:19.708
- He also, he has
- two brothers, you know.

25:19.711 --> 25:21.041
He doesn't have sisters.

25:21.042 --> 25:22.184
- I don't have a sister,
- and my mom was very hard on me.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.208
- And you grew up...
- I remember in high school,

25:23.211 --> 25:24.809
- His group of friends
- was a bunch of guys.

25:24.833 --> 25:25.875
I'm always - gonna be angry...

25:25.878 --> 25:27.541
Do you love me?

25:27.542 --> 25:28.542
- Yeah, I care about you
- a lot.

25:28.543 --> 25:29.542
- Do you come from
- a place of love?

25:29.545 --> 25:30.707
Yes.

25:30.708 --> 25:31.708
- And we've had
- our differences in the past?

25:31.709 --> 25:32.708
Yes.

25:32.709 --> 25:33.893
- And we always mend
- and come back together

25:33.917 --> 25:35.063
Because I know deep down

25:35.064 --> 25:36.208
you love me and I love you.

25:36.250 --> 25:37.542
(speaking - foreign language)

25:37.545 --> 25:39.042
- And I will f... ing stick up
- for you any day of the week.

25:39.045 --> 25:40.542
Yeah, you did today.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.125
I would f... somebody up

25:42.126 --> 25:43.667
who hurts you. You know that.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.833
- Yeah.
- All I'm asking you

25:44.875 --> 25:46.188
Is just be sensitive

25:46.189 --> 25:47.500
of what I'm going through

25:47.542 --> 25:49.208
- the same way I'm sensitive
- of what you're going through,

25:49.211 --> 25:51.083
- And we'll have
- a great friendship.

25:51.086 --> 25:52.582
Yes.

25:52.583 --> 25:53.934
- [Voiceover] Coming up...
- Lie. Lie.

25:53.958 --> 25:55.583
- Can you shut up?
- Shut the f... up.

25:55.584 --> 25:56.601
- You're a mentally ill woman.
- Shut the f... up.

25:56.625 --> 25:57.583
- Okay...
- Shut the f... up.

25:57.584 --> 25:58.584
I feel sorry for you.

25:58.625 --> 25:59.729
You're

25:59.730 --> 26:00.833
a mentally ill woman.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.479
GG, this year you came under

26:11.480 --> 26:13.082
a lot of scrutiny

26:13.083 --> 26:14.292
over your drinking

26:14.293 --> 26:15.500
and your health issues.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.063
What is RA and what's

26:17.064 --> 26:18.583
your history with it?

26:18.625 --> 26:20.749
RA is rheumatoid arthritis,

26:20.750 --> 26:23.146
and it's now six years

26:23.147 --> 26:25.542
since I got first diagnosed.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.542
- I had ups and downs,
- and then last year

26:27.583 --> 26:28.583
I was really getting

26:28.584 --> 26:29.583
down, down, down.

26:29.584 --> 26:31.250
It's attacked

26:31.251 --> 26:32.917
my whole body right now.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.188
My doctors have said

26:34.189 --> 26:35.417
I have to do chemo.

26:35.458 --> 26:37.271
The options range

26:37.272 --> 26:39.083
from rituximab,

26:39.125 --> 26:40.167
abatacept, Orencia,

26:40.168 --> 26:41.208
and then...

26:41.250 --> 26:42.604
These are all

26:42.605 --> 26:43.957
in the family of chemo?

26:43.958 --> 26:45.104
Rituxan

26:45.105 --> 26:46.250
is the only one that is.

26:46.292 --> 26:47.458
- I don't want to spend
- a lot of time

26:47.461 --> 26:49.083
- Telling you about
- side effects

26:49.125 --> 26:50.625
- Of things
- that I'm not gonna use.

26:50.628 --> 26:51.792
She's just now

26:51.793 --> 26:52.957
gone to this doctor

26:52.958 --> 26:54.271
to find out not all

26:54.272 --> 26:55.583
the treatment options

26:55.625 --> 26:56.854
should even be classified

26:56.855 --> 26:58.083
as chemo.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.604
Golnesa is lying

27:01.605 --> 27:03.457
about having RA.

27:03.458 --> 27:04.476
- Why are there stories
- out there

27:04.500 --> 27:05.458
You had chemotherapy?

27:05.459 --> 27:06.476
- Why are you talking
- to nothing?

27:06.500 --> 27:08.354
It's going

27:08.355 --> 27:10.208
to my heart. Oh!

27:10.250 --> 27:11.875
Reza, how did you feel

27:11.876 --> 27:13.499
when you saw her have chemo

27:13.500 --> 27:14.729
after you had doubted that

27:14.730 --> 27:15.958
that was actually happening?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.229
What's she's getting, in

27:18.230 --> 27:20.458
huge doses, it's chemotherapy.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.813
She's getting an infusion, and

27:21.814 --> 27:23.125
if she changed her lifestyle,

27:23.167 --> 27:24.917
- she probably
- wouldn't need that.

27:24.958 --> 27:26.208
And honestly, I went

27:26.209 --> 27:27.458
and saw a rheumatologist

27:27.500 --> 27:29.333
- because I wanted
- to figure this out.

27:29.336 --> 27:30.667
That's a little - aggressive,

27:30.670 --> 27:32.458
- For you to go see
- a rheumatoid doctor.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.667
Why? Why?

27:33.668 --> 27:34.832
To investigate her.

27:34.833 --> 27:35.833
- It's obsession.
- Totally obsessed.

27:35.836 --> 27:37.667
- Why?
- Yeah.

27:37.708 --> 27:38.976
- If you had
- something wrong with you

27:39.000 --> 27:41.292
- And I went to a doctor
- to find something out about it?

27:41.333 --> 27:43.292
If you had a friend who

27:43.293 --> 27:45.250
was chewing your head off,

27:45.292 --> 27:46.396
was telling you things

27:46.397 --> 27:47.499
that don't add up,

27:47.500 --> 27:49.542
and you care about the friend,

27:49.543 --> 27:51.583
which at the time, I did...

27:51.625 --> 27:52.625
No, you didn't.

27:52.667 --> 27:53.667
- You didn't care about me
- at the time

27:53.670 --> 27:55.042
- That you went to go check
- with this doctor.

27:55.045 --> 27:56.375
- I wanted to find out
- what was going on.

27:56.376 --> 27:57.375
- At the time that you went
- to go check with this doctor,

27:57.376 --> 27:58.333
You didn't anymore.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.208
- You did that to put on
- a whole little show.

28:00.211 --> 28:01.542
Methotrexate Rituxan.

28:01.543 --> 28:02.874
Anyone can Google it.

28:02.875 --> 28:04.625
- I went with her
- to her first surgery.

28:04.667 --> 28:06.393
- She definitely has RA.
- Yeah, there's no question.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.375
- It's a nasty disease,
- it's disgusting, right,

28:08.378 --> 28:10.208
- And she's in pain,
- and I know she is.

28:10.211 --> 28:11.667
I have a major problem with

28:11.668 --> 28:13.125
the word "chemotherapy."

28:13.167 --> 28:15.125
I had to go daily

28:15.167 --> 28:16.688
and watch my uncle disappear

28:16.689 --> 28:18.207
going through chemotherapy.

28:18.208 --> 28:19.438
I'm very connected to it,

28:19.439 --> 28:20.667
as I'm sure everybody can say

28:20.708 --> 28:22.667
- that have some kind
- of story about that.

28:22.708 --> 28:24.333
What you get is a DMARD.

28:24.375 --> 28:25.959
What a DMARD does is just helps

28:25.960 --> 28:27.541
slow down the progression.

28:27.542 --> 28:29.542
So your point is that Golnesa

28:29.543 --> 28:31.542
never made the distinction.

28:31.583 --> 28:33.042
She wanted people to think

28:33.043 --> 28:34.500
she was having the chemo

28:34.542 --> 28:35.542
that you get from cancer.

28:35.543 --> 28:37.083
Cancer patients, yes.

28:37.125 --> 28:38.434
- F... ing put a knife
- in my back.

28:38.458 --> 28:39.750
I made a f... ing mistake.

28:39.792 --> 28:40.917
Yeah, you made a mistake.

28:40.958 --> 28:42.684
- Is that not acceptable
- with these people?

28:42.708 --> 28:44.333
I mean, what the f...?

28:44.375 --> 28:45.417
- Nobody can make
- a f... ing mistake ever.

28:45.418 --> 28:46.417
- You never said
- you made a mistake.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.583
- Did you misunderstand
- the doctor?

28:47.586 --> 28:48.792
I thought I was going

28:48.793 --> 28:50.000
to start a new treatment.

28:50.042 --> 28:52.749
She makes up stories.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.209
Like Shervin said,

28:54.210 --> 28:55.667
she wakes up at 1:30,

28:55.708 --> 28:56.875
she plots all day.

28:56.917 --> 28:58.250
You know, she literally

28:58.292 --> 29:00.250
- has nothing going on
- in her life,

29:00.253 --> 29:02.208
- And she tries to come up
- with bullsh...

29:02.250 --> 29:03.250
To hurt people

29:03.251 --> 29:04.251
and get drama.

29:04.292 --> 29:06.434
- Her own sister doesn't have
- anything to do with her.

29:06.458 --> 29:08.104
GG, after you argued with Reza

29:08.105 --> 29:09.749
at the Mayan temple,

29:09.750 --> 29:11.250
you told MJ about a video

29:11.251 --> 29:12.749
that you saw

29:12.750 --> 29:14.916
that you said that you have,

29:14.917 --> 29:16.313
of Reza having sex

29:16.314 --> 29:17.708
with someone at the gym.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.457
This guy at the gym,

29:19.458 --> 29:21.104
he has a video of Reza

29:21.105 --> 29:22.750
and him f... ing.

29:22.792 --> 29:24.457
So if I have fake stories,

29:24.458 --> 29:25.917
let's see

29:25.918 --> 29:27.375
how fake they are.

29:27.417 --> 29:28.646
Why did you wait

29:28.647 --> 29:29.875
until that moment

29:29.917 --> 29:31.124
to tell MJ about the video?

29:31.125 --> 29:32.375
Because a lot of sh...

29:32.376 --> 29:33.624
Happened that day,

29:33.625 --> 29:35.268
- and a lot of things
- were said, and I...

29:35.292 --> 29:37.250
- At that point,
- I lost my cool.

29:37.292 --> 29:38.792
This was told to me

29:38.793 --> 29:40.291
literally five and a half...

29:40.292 --> 29:41.457
After first season.

29:41.458 --> 29:42.792
- After first season
- had aired,

29:42.833 --> 29:44.375
- This was told to me
- about this guy.

29:44.417 --> 29:45.646
It was told to you that...

29:45.647 --> 29:46.875
By the guy.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.417
By the actual guy.

29:48.458 --> 29:49.750
- That's how
- you got the video?

29:49.792 --> 29:51.750
No. If I ever said - I had it,

29:51.792 --> 29:52.917
I'm sorry, I was lying.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.521
I played the video

29:54.522 --> 29:56.083
for Asa and Shervin right now

29:56.125 --> 29:57.125
when we were at

29:57.126 --> 29:58.125
the art show.

29:58.126 --> 30:00.000
- Do you have a video of me
- blowing somebody?

30:00.003 --> 30:01.333
100%.

30:01.375 --> 30:02.584
You do? 100%? Okay.

30:02.585 --> 30:03.792
(laughs)

30:03.833 --> 30:05.101
- I said,
- "Do you have a video."

30:05.125 --> 30:06.792
- I just said if I said it,
- I lied.

30:06.833 --> 30:08.000
- Can you shut up?
- Shut the f... up.

30:08.003 --> 30:09.684
- You're a mentally ill woman.
- Shut the f... up.

30:09.708 --> 30:10.667
- Okay. All right.
- Shut the f... up.

30:10.708 --> 30:11.667
I feel sorry for you.

30:11.708 --> 30:12.750
You're

30:12.751 --> 30:13.792
a mentally ill woman.

30:13.833 --> 30:15.792
Okay, let me ask you this.

30:15.833 --> 30:17.500
- If there was a video
- of him fooling around

30:17.503 --> 30:18.834
With someone at the gym

30:18.835 --> 30:20.167
from five years ago,

30:20.208 --> 30:22.167
- what does that even matter,
- out of curiosity?

30:22.170 --> 30:23.667
- He wasn't married.
- Exactly the same thing.

30:23.670 --> 30:25.084
It has nothing to do with him

30:25.085 --> 30:26.499
what was happening in my life.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.792
- If I'm faking RA,
- it has nothing to do with him.

30:28.833 --> 30:29.896
If I'm faking needing

30:29.897 --> 30:30.958
any kind of medication,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.167
- it has nothing
- to do with him.

30:32.170 --> 30:33.268
- If he's going through
- a divorce,

30:33.292 --> 30:34.750
- It has nothing
- to do with him.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.000
- If she's a pill-popper,
- it has nothing to do with him.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.417
Then get off my show.

30:38.458 --> 30:39.518
- Nobody ever wants
- to turn it back.

30:39.542 --> 30:41.208
- The minute somebody
- says something

30:41.211 --> 30:43.184
- To this piece of sh...
- Get off my show. Peace out.

30:43.208 --> 30:44.542
- Oh, no, all hell
- breaks loose.

30:44.543 --> 30:45.542
You're psychotic.

30:45.543 --> 30:47.018
- Let me go call
- the rheumatologist.

30:47.042 --> 30:48.417
GG, why did you threaten him

30:48.418 --> 30:49.792
with the video?

30:49.833 --> 30:51.309
- Why did you threaten...
- How you said it...

30:51.333 --> 30:52.809
- I didn't threaten him
- with it, I told her.

30:52.833 --> 30:53.792
- You told her.
- I told her.

30:53.833 --> 30:54.792
It sounded like, look,

30:54.833 --> 30:56.167
I'm gonna bring out

30:56.168 --> 30:57.500
this video.

30:57.542 --> 30:59.582
- 'Cause he's playing dirty,
- I'm gonna play dirty.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.458
Does the video exist?

31:02.500 --> 31:03.708
Of course not.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.063
Golnesa Joon,

31:05.064 --> 31:06.375
you know I care about you.

31:06.417 --> 31:09.542
To say something that extreme

31:09.543 --> 31:12.667
about a friend is a lot.

31:12.708 --> 31:13.667
Yes.

31:13.708 --> 31:14.875
- That's a very extreme
- statement.

31:14.878 --> 31:16.518
- You can't just throw
- that around lightly.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.667
Way Below the Belt

31:17.668 --> 31:18.792
tweeted,

31:18.833 --> 31:20.250
"Something happened to Golnesa"

31:20.251 --> 31:21.667
that was never addressed.

31:21.708 --> 31:22.979
"Anger, trust issues, abuse?"

31:22.980 --> 31:24.249
What was it?

31:24.250 --> 31:26.042
Someone hurt her,

31:26.043 --> 31:27.833
"and this is her coping."

31:27.875 --> 31:30.458
Did somebody hurt you?

31:35.708 --> 31:36.726
- [Voiceover]
- Coming up...

31:36.750 --> 31:37.834
You knew what effect

31:37.835 --> 31:38.916
it was having on me,

31:38.917 --> 31:40.167
the damage that

31:40.168 --> 31:41.416
it was causing in my life.

31:41.417 --> 31:43.250
- You don't know
- what kind of destruction

31:43.251 --> 31:44.250
- You caused
- in someone's life.

31:44.253 --> 31:45.833
This is a crock of sh...

31:45.875 --> 31:47.184
- You should just stop
- right now.

31:47.208 --> 31:48.333
What am I, supposed to cry

31:48.375 --> 31:49.604
to make everyone else

31:49.605 --> 31:50.833
realize that I'm hurt?

32:01.917 --> 32:03.500
Why not?

32:03.542 --> 32:05.458
- It triggers her psychosis.
- (chuckles)

32:05.461 --> 32:06.792
Sweetie...

32:06.793 --> 32:08.125
Sorry.

32:08.167 --> 32:09.896
I truly... I pray for you,

32:09.897 --> 32:11.624
Reza, I do.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.124
I pray for you, sweetie.

32:13.125 --> 32:14.476
- You're gonna kill somebody
- one day.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.809
- I think I feel that.
- I feel the energy.

32:15.833 --> 32:16.893
- You're gonna kill somebody
- one day.

32:16.917 --> 32:17.917
I appreciate it.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.434
- Instead of
- worrying about your RA,

32:19.458 --> 32:20.542
Why don't you go deal with

32:20.543 --> 32:21.624
your mental illnesses?

32:21.625 --> 32:23.271
Reza, how did you

32:23.272 --> 32:24.917
come up with the plan

32:24.958 --> 32:26.708
to deliver flowers and

32:26.709 --> 32:28.457
handwritten apology letters

32:28.458 --> 32:30.750
posing as GG?

32:30.792 --> 32:31.958
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

32:31.961 --> 32:33.624
"I want to apologize."

32:33.625 --> 32:35.188
"I've called you fat,

32:35.189 --> 32:36.750
ugly, old."

32:36.792 --> 32:38.750
- "I've called you
- a transvestite,

32:38.792 --> 32:40.042
And I've even tried

32:40.043 --> 32:41.291
"to jump you."

32:41.292 --> 32:43.208
I have a confession.

32:43.250 --> 32:44.791
I wrote all the letters.

32:44.792 --> 32:45.792
That was

32:45.793 --> 32:46.792
very interesting to me.

32:46.793 --> 32:48.646
Honestly, I thought

32:48.647 --> 32:50.499
that if she heard out loud

32:50.500 --> 32:52.500
all of the disgusting things

32:52.501 --> 32:54.499
that she's done to everyone,

32:54.500 --> 32:55.584
that she would have

32:55.585 --> 32:56.667
an epiphany,

32:56.708 --> 32:58.396
she would apologize for it,

32:58.397 --> 33:00.083
and it would be over.

33:00.125 --> 33:01.434
- It felt like
- a f... you to you?

33:01.458 --> 33:04.000
Yeah, oh, it was.

33:04.042 --> 33:05.166
I wrote and rewrote them.

33:05.167 --> 33:06.332
Reza, never have you ever

33:06.333 --> 33:08.250
- been able
- to pull me to the side

33:08.292 --> 33:09.518
- And talk to me
- from your heart.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.000
- You have never been able
- to do that with me.

33:11.003 --> 33:12.332
Because you're so angry.

33:12.333 --> 33:14.083
- No, no...
- You're so angry.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.976
- When people talk to me calmly,
- I respond calmly.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.417
Golnesa, you throw things

33:17.418 --> 33:18.832
in people's faces.

33:18.833 --> 33:19.958
Reza, no, I don't, Reza.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Okay.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.500
Why did you go - attack Reza?

33:22.542 --> 33:24.125
I lost my sh...

33:24.167 --> 33:26.417
Oh, f... ing sh...

33:26.458 --> 33:28.208
- F...
- Watch out.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.396
F... his ass. F... you,

33:29.397 --> 33:30.542
you f... b...

33:30.583 --> 33:31.792
GG, look out.

33:31.793 --> 33:33.000
Ouch, GG!

33:33.042 --> 33:35.000
- F... you!
- F... you! F... you!

33:35.042 --> 33:36.792
- Okay. All right.
- F... you! F... you!

33:36.833 --> 33:39.333
Let go of me!

33:39.375 --> 33:40.792
First of all, I am so sorry

33:40.793 --> 33:42.207
for what happened to Adam.

33:42.208 --> 33:43.848
- Those were not
- my intentions at all...

33:43.875 --> 33:45.041
That wasn't your fault.

33:45.042 --> 33:46.184
- For anything
- to happen to Adam.

33:46.208 --> 33:47.167
- Those weren't
- your nail marks?

33:47.208 --> 33:48.208
- My hand...
- He was holding the rose,

33:48.211 --> 33:50.125
- My hand went over it,
- and it went like this.

33:50.167 --> 33:51.393
- But what were you
- trying to do?

33:51.417 --> 33:52.792
- At that moment,
- I don't know.

33:52.833 --> 33:53.851
- Andy, what would have
- happened...

33:53.875 --> 33:54.833
I wasn't there anymore.

33:54.875 --> 33:55.875
If I was the one

33:55.876 --> 33:56.875
that did that to her?

33:56.875 --> 33:57.875
- All hell
- would have broken loose.

33:57.878 --> 33:59.084
Reza, you did it to me

33:59.085 --> 34:00.292
emotionally.

34:00.333 --> 34:01.351
Golnesa, - you made up a lie.

34:01.375 --> 34:02.684
- You didn't do it
- to me physically.

34:02.708 --> 34:03.875
- You did it to me
- emotionally.

34:03.878 --> 34:05.375
- Golnesa,
- you didn't make up a lie?

34:05.417 --> 34:06.875
- I lied. I didn't see it.
- Okay.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.208
- I didn't have it.
- You did lie. No problem.

34:08.211 --> 34:10.083
- Do you regret
- bringing it up?

34:10.086 --> 34:11.582
100% I regret it.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.000
I have no anger

34:13.001 --> 34:14.417
towards Reza anymore.

34:14.458 --> 34:16.583
- We haven't had any
- communication since that night.

34:16.586 --> 34:18.000
100% right. Right.

34:18.042 --> 34:19.438
I said, Golnesa,

34:19.439 --> 34:20.833
do you have a tape?

34:20.875 --> 34:22.542
I wanted you to say no,

34:22.583 --> 34:23.833
and you said,

34:23.834 --> 34:25.082
"Yes, I have it, 100%."

34:25.083 --> 34:26.208
You knew what effect

34:26.209 --> 34:27.333
it was having on me.

34:27.375 --> 34:29.396
You knew that I had a man

34:29.397 --> 34:31.416
that I just loved and buried,

34:31.417 --> 34:33.583
- what damage that was causing
- in my life.

34:33.586 --> 34:35.083
And you stood there

34:35.084 --> 34:36.583
and you said, "100%."

34:36.625 --> 34:38.063
And then when we left,

34:38.064 --> 34:39.500
you charged and you jumped us.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.042
What do you want me to do?

34:41.083 --> 34:42.083
- You don't know what kind
- of destruction

34:42.086 --> 34:43.583
- You caused
- in someone's life.

34:43.625 --> 34:44.583
You can't...

34:44.625 --> 34:46.417
We could have - resolved that.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.417
- We could have had
- a conversation.

34:47.458 --> 34:48.518
- We did.
- I came to your villa...

34:48.542 --> 34:50.083
- I didn't make up stories
- about you.

34:50.086 --> 34:51.250
- In Belize, I came
- to your villa in Belize.

34:51.253 --> 34:52.625
- But we had a fight
- right after that.

34:52.628 --> 34:53.958
- You should just stop
- right now.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.042
Stop, stop.

34:55.043 --> 34:56.124
I'm talking to him.

34:56.125 --> 34:57.125
Golnesa, we had a fight

34:57.126 --> 34:58.126
after that.

34:58.167 --> 34:59.417
Yes, we did.

34:59.458 --> 35:01.125
It did so much damage.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.563
It did.

35:02.564 --> 35:03.958
I work. I have a job.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.479
You have the luxury

35:05.480 --> 35:06.957
of not having a job.

35:06.958 --> 35:08.208
Do you know what it does

35:08.209 --> 35:09.457
to my credibility

35:09.458 --> 35:10.458
when one of my friends...

35:10.459 --> 35:12.208
What about my credibility?

35:12.250 --> 35:14.125
- What the f...?
- Wait, please.

35:14.128 --> 35:15.625
I didn't get involved with

35:15.626 --> 35:17.125
you and Asa and you and Mike.

35:17.167 --> 35:19.292
- I'm trying to raise money
- for children who are dying.

35:19.295 --> 35:20.809
- I just need to...
- I don't wanna be crying.

35:20.833 --> 35:21.792
- Why won't you see
- what you did to me?

35:21.833 --> 35:22.958
I'm not walking away,

35:23.000 --> 35:24.101
- I want to walk away
- just because I'm crying.

35:24.125 --> 35:25.083
- I'm sorry,
- I can't sit here and cry

35:25.125 --> 35:26.393
- To make other people
- feel bad.

35:26.417 --> 35:27.958
- I can't cry.
- Have a conscience.

35:27.961 --> 35:29.125
- If I cried,
- would anyone else feel bad?

35:29.128 --> 35:30.334
Have a conscience.

35:30.335 --> 35:31.542
Oh, because I can't cry?

35:31.583 --> 35:33.167
No, because - you're a bitch.

35:33.208 --> 35:35.167
Oh, so are you, - sweetheart.

35:35.170 --> 35:36.625
Yeah, kiss my ass.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.250
- Whoa, no, what,
- am I supposed to cry

35:38.292 --> 35:39.563
To make everyone realize

35:39.564 --> 35:40.832
that I'm hurt?

35:40.833 --> 35:44.958
(exhales) Oh.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.396
This is a result of what

35:46.397 --> 35:47.792
your actions have done.

35:47.833 --> 35:49.042
Right, but what about

35:49.043 --> 35:50.250
the result of his?

35:50.292 --> 35:51.833
- But, Golnesa,
- you're always the one

35:51.836 --> 35:52.999
Who goes there first.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.146
You go really low

35:54.147 --> 35:55.292
really fast.

35:55.333 --> 35:58.332
Rez.

35:58.333 --> 36:00.229
I'm sorry. I did not start

36:00.230 --> 36:02.125
the whole "I'm faking RA" thing.

36:02.167 --> 36:03.833
- I didn't get on the ground
- on the grass

36:03.836 --> 36:04.999
In front of the Mayan ruins,

36:05.000 --> 36:06.084
making fun of me

36:06.085 --> 36:07.167
for being in the hospital

36:07.208 --> 36:08.833
with an EKG abnormal result.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.143
- You started
- the sex tape thing.

36:10.167 --> 36:11.667
That's a very - extreme thing.

36:11.708 --> 36:13.000
You use sex as a f... ing...

36:13.042 --> 36:14.833
- As a weapon
- all the time, though.

36:14.836 --> 36:15.976
- She's saying
- that she retaliated.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.875
- He started it
- by doubting her RA.

36:17.917 --> 36:19.230
And by the way, he didn't

36:19.231 --> 36:20.541
always doubt your RA.

36:20.542 --> 36:21.893
- You guys were at the spa
- together.

36:21.917 --> 36:23.458
- He doesn't own
- that it hurt me.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.333
I'm gonna go get them.

36:25.375 --> 36:26.792
It's not okay.

36:27.875 --> 36:29.500
Hey, it's Andy.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.375
- Can I have
- some champagne, please?

36:31.417 --> 36:33.041
Yeah. Dan?

36:33.042 --> 36:34.334
I think I have a way

36:34.335 --> 36:35.625
that we can move forward.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.708
Can you guys come back?

36:38.875 --> 36:39.958
Thank you.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.208
- You should just
- stick around for a second.

36:43.250 --> 36:45.374
Take it easy, Geege.

36:45.375 --> 36:46.792
I have a thought,

36:46.793 --> 36:48.208
because I hear what you said.

36:48.250 --> 36:50.042
- You need him to own
- what he did to you,

36:50.045 --> 36:51.105
And he needs you to own

36:51.106 --> 36:52.167
what you did to him.

36:52.208 --> 36:53.208
Right.

36:54.542 --> 36:56.207
MJ, you got your nosh?

36:56.208 --> 36:57.250
- Do you know
- how good this is?

36:57.253 --> 36:58.416
It's a chick pea cookie.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.417
Have you ever had it before?

36:59.418 --> 37:00.750
I'm not a big - chick pea guy.

37:00.792 --> 37:02.271
All right, you got your

37:02.272 --> 37:03.750
little juice pack, buddy?

37:03.792 --> 37:04.855
Sorry. Yeah.

37:04.856 --> 37:05.916
Okay.

37:05.917 --> 37:07.583
- Um...
- Before you say anything,

37:07.625 --> 37:09.021
I'm sorry I didn't allow you

37:13.125 --> 37:14.559
- that that caused you
- to get up and leave,

37:14.583 --> 37:15.875
Because I don't want...

37:15.917 --> 37:18.083
- I didn't even wanna continue
- talking without you here.

37:18.086 --> 37:19.875
I wasn't getting up to leave

37:19.876 --> 37:21.667
because I was upset with you.

37:21.708 --> 37:23.375
I was getting up to leave

37:23.376 --> 37:25.042

37:25.083 --> 37:26.833
I was so emotional...

37:26.834 --> 37:28.582
(sobs)

37:28.583 --> 37:29.750
You didn't wanna cry.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.396
that I love so much,

37:39.397 --> 37:41.042
that I just married.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.833
The story about the sex tape

37:42.834 --> 37:44.583
was hurting him, not me,

37:44.625 --> 37:46.250
and it was humiliating

37:46.251 --> 37:47.875
and hurtful to him.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.124
And I just...

37:49.125 --> 37:51.667
You felt powerless, yeah.

37:53.458 --> 37:54.476

- hearing that?

Horrible.

37:58.833 --> 38:00.309
- Because you've just
- poured your heart out.

38:02.189 --> 38:04.042
very hurt, both of you.

38:04.083 --> 38:05.771
And I think

38:05.772 --> 38:07.458
that what's important is

38:07.500 --> 38:08.958
- she lied about
- having the sex tape,

38:08.961 --> 38:10.792
- She's saying to you.
- Yes. Yes.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.834
that it might have caused

38:22.835 --> 38:24.166
as well from my lies.

38:24.167 --> 38:25.417
And what she said

38:25.418 --> 38:26.666
when you were gone is

38:26.667 --> 38:28.084
she has not heard an apology

38:28.085 --> 38:29.499
from you about the RA thing,

38:29.500 --> 38:31.084
which she felt

38:31.085 --> 38:32.667
really hurt her.

38:32.708 --> 38:34.271
Is there a part that

38:34.272 --> 38:35.833
you could apologize for

38:35.875 --> 38:38.084
