23:48.961 --> 23:49.929
Pilot: HAPPY NEW YEAR.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.197

23:51.230 --> 23:52.832
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU,

23:52.865 --> 23:54.200
I'M READY AND I'M HERE.
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?

23:54.233 --> 23:55.935
UH, RIGHT. WELL, UH...

23:55.968 --> 23:57.203
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO NEED THAT, ACTUALLY.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.071
I WANT YOU ASSISTING
ON THE PRINTERS.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.941
YOU WANT ME
RUNNING FLIGHT STRIPS?

24:01.974 --> 24:03.543
SURE, MAN. I'M THERE.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.544
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
I'M GOING TO HELP YOU

24:04.577 --> 24:05.812
GET PLUGGED BACK IN,
BUT...

24:05.845 --> 24:08.114

24:08.147 --> 24:09.949
DESCEND

24:09.982 --> 24:11.518
I MEAN, BELIEVE ME,
THIS IS NOT THE NIGHT.

24:11.551 --> 24:12.919
LOOK WHAT WE'RE
DEALING WITH.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.688
I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.724
YEAH, I'LL
CHECK WITH YOU LATER.

24:17.757 --> 24:18.825
I KNOW. LET'S GET
A DRINK OR SOMETHING.

24:18.858 --> 24:19.926
I DON'T DRINK.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.961
A CUP OF TEA. WHATEVER.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.230
YOU GOT IT, T.C.,
THANKS.

24:24.263 --> 24:27.066

DIRECTIONS

24:35.608 --> 24:37.577

IN TEMPE?

24:37.610 --> 24:39.478
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

24:41.113 --> 24:42.915
BONANZA NINER ECHO.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.251
TRAFFIC ON A FINAL 2 MILES.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.054
EXPEDITE YOUR CROSS,
RUNWAY 2-6 RIGHT.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.155

24:50.657 --> 24:52.058
Man: HELLO?

24:52.091 --> 24:53.225

24:53.259 --> 24:54.961

24:58.565 --> 24:59.732

25:03.035 --> 25:05.705
HELLO? PHOENIX TOWER,

25:05.738 --> 25:07.940

25:45.011 --> 25:46.212
SEQUENCE FOR A BUCK?

25:46.245 --> 25:48.047
HOW MUCH TIME DO I GET?

25:48.080 --> 25:50.783
AMERICAN 87, PHOENIX,
TURN LEFT 10 DEGREES

25:50.817 --> 25:52.318

SHOOT.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.322

26:07.834 --> 26:08.801
[IMITATING BUZZER]
EEH.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.703
UH, E-150.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.939
WRONG. E-165.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.707
YOU'RE SLIPPING,
MAN.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.264
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
MY CONTROLLERS.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.700
YOUR CONTROLLERS
WILL BE FINE.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.268
THEY'RE AMONG THE MOST
HIGHLY TRAINED PEOPLE

26:42.301 --> 26:43.803
WORKING FOR
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.105
I GOT WIND AT 80 KNOTS
BELOW 3,000 FEET

26:46.138 --> 26:48.407
AND ZERO VISIBILITY
HEADED STRAIGHT FOR US.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.711
WRONG. THE STORM
STALLED.

26:51.744 --> 26:54.346
EVEN SO, I ALREADY HAVE
TO FLY 48 PLANES

26:54.380 --> 26:56.248
THROUGH A CRACK OF SMOOTH AIR
TIGHTER THAN YOUR BUDGET.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.217
WE CANNOT HANDLE
THE ADDITIONAL FLIGHTS.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.152
IF DENVER CAN DO IT,
WE CAN DO IT.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.789
OH, DAMN IT, SUSAN, THIS
IS ABOUT THE COMMITTEE REVIEW.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.757
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND
YOUR FACILITY RATING.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.193
WELL, THIS IS NOT
CHICAGO APPROACH, SUSAN.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.828
THIS IS NOT NEW YORK.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.797
NOW I KNOW WHY

27:10.830 --> 27:12.732
YOU STEPPED DOWN
FROM CHICAGO.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.767
YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT,
COULD YA?

27:28.447 --> 27:31.650
HEY, WHERE'S MY DAMN STRIPS?

27:36.422 --> 27:38.725
I PUT THEM IN ORDER
OF ALTITUDE.

27:40.092 --> 27:43.262
Pilot: PHOENIX, SOUTHWEST 556.
DID YOU SAY 3-5-0?

27:43.295 --> 27:46.833
HEY. HEY. ROOKIE?
ROOKIE?

27:46.866 --> 27:47.900
WHAT?

27:47.934 --> 27:49.902
HI. HI. SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.270
WHAT ARE THESE JETS
DOING IN MY SECTOR?

27:51.303 --> 27:52.905
I-I-I DON'T KNOW. I--

27:52.939 --> 27:55.107
GET THEM OUT
OF MY AIR NOW.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.243
Pilot: PHOENIX, TWA 44,
HOW ABOUT 2-4-0?

27:57.276 --> 27:59.979
TWA 44, I CAN'T--I CAN'T
APPROVE THAT RIGHT NOW.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.715
CAN YOU HOLD ON A MINUTE?

28:02.749 --> 28:04.250
GOD, I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.919
OH, GOD. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.821
UM, OK.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.289
UNITED. I MEAN, TWA--

28:10.322 --> 28:13.125
TWA 44, PHOENIX,
FLY TO 2-NINER-0.

28:13.159 --> 28:17.196
Pilot: TWA 44, HEADING
2-NINER-0. ROGER.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.198
SOUTHWEST 556,
EXPEDITE CLIMB.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.367
MAINTAIN FLIGHT LEVEL
2-7-0. REDUCE

28:21.400 --> 28:23.035
TO 2-5-0 KNOTS.

28:23.069 --> 28:26.739
SOUTHWEST 556, CLIMBING
TO 2-7-0 AT 2-5-0 KNOTS.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.040
WHY SO SLOW?

28:28.074 --> 28:30.409
SOUTHWEST 556, WE GOTTA
UNTIE A KNOT HERE,

28:30.442 --> 28:32.111
BUT WE WILL GET YOU
BACK TO SPEED,

28:32.144 --> 28:34.246
AND I PROMISE A SMOOTH
TAILWIND ACROSS KANSAS.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.748
IS THERE A TAILWIND?

28:35.782 --> 28:38.084
I DON'T KNOW, BUT PILOTS
LOVE TO HEAR IT.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.753
I'M SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE
INTRODUCED MYSELF SOONER.

28:40.787 --> 28:41.754
I'M JULIE ALBRECHT.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.756
JACK HARRIS.

28:43.790 --> 28:44.891
CAN I GIVE YOU A TIP?

28:44.924 --> 28:45.992
PLEASE.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.894
PILOTS ARE KIND
OF LIKE DOGS.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.128
YOU TELL THEM WHAT
YOU WANT THEM TO DO.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.030
BUT IF THEY HEAR FEAR
IN YOUR VOICE,

28:51.063 --> 28:52.164
THEY'RE GONNA START
TO TAKE THINGS

28:52.198 --> 28:53.299
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.333
SO NO MATTER HOW CRAZY

28:54.366 --> 28:56.002
IT GETS ON THERE,

28:56.035 --> 28:57.837
YOU KEEP YOUR VOICE
STRONG.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.107
RIGHT. I-I-I--SORRY,
I JUST GOT DISTRACTED.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.775
IF YOU WANT TO GET
A PILOT TO DO SOMETHING,

29:02.809 --> 29:04.310
THE MAGIC WORD
IS EXPEDITE.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.178
EXPEDITE YOUR CLIMB
IMMEDIATELY.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.313
EXPEDITE.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.916
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.984
YOUR MAJOR CONCERN
IS RIGHT HERE.

29:12.018 --> 29:12.985
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE
SEPARATION

29:13.019 --> 29:14.020
IN A COUPLE MINUTES.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.088
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS TURN HIM,

29:16.122 --> 29:17.924
SLOW HIM DOWN, AND
TUCK THIS ONE IN

29:17.957 --> 29:19.191
RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.259
LEFT?

29:20.292 --> 29:21.794
NO. TURN HIM FIRST.

29:21.828 --> 29:26.165
1-8-0, AND YOU BETTER
SLOW HIM DOWN TO 300.

29:26.198 --> 29:29.201
AMERICAN 101, TURN RIGHT
HEADING 1-8-0,

29:29.235 --> 29:31.170
REDUCE TO 2-5-0 KNOTS.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.371
THERE YOU GO.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.006
SEE, ONE OF THE HARDEST
THINGS TO GRASP

29:34.040 --> 29:36.008
IS THAT YOU'RE DEALING
WITH A 2-DIMENSIONAL IMAGE,

29:36.042 --> 29:37.543
BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY
DEALING WITH 3 DIMENSIONS--

29:37.576 --> 29:39.846
ALTITUDE, DIRECTION,
AND SPEED.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.113
WHICH MEANS TIME.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.481
PLUS, YOU GOTTA STAY
A COUPLE STEPS

29:42.514 --> 29:43.916
AHEAD OF THESE GUYS.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.918
LOOK, RIGHT HERE.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.219
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A TERRIBLE TANGLE HERE

29:47.253 --> 29:48.220
IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.956
BUT ONCE YOU
REALIZE THAT,

29:49.989 --> 29:51.824
THAT'S 95%
OF THE BATTLE.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.092
WHERE?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.494
NOW, WHOEVER'S WORKING
SECTOR 25 HIGH

29:55.527 --> 29:57.263
KINDA SCREWS YOU BY
SENDING THIS PARADE IN

29:57.296 --> 29:59.265
ALL MESSED UP LIKE THIS,

29:59.298 --> 30:00.833
BUT WE'LL GET THEM
LINED UP IN NO TIME.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.334
I SEE IT.

30:02.368 --> 30:05.604
ALTITUDE, DIRECTION,
AND SPEED.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.140
SO, WE'LL TURN
UNITED FIRST?

30:08.174 --> 30:09.842
NO.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.845
HE'S THE CLOSEST, BUT
HE'S GOING THE SLOWEST.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.580
ALL RIGHT.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.548
SOUTHWEST 60,

30:16.582 --> 30:19.218
TURN LEFT HEADING
0-NINER-5. BREAK.

30:19.251 --> 30:22.855
CONTINENTAL 923, TURN
RIGHT HEADING 2-7-0.

30:22.889 --> 30:26.125
BREAK. PHOENIX AIR 394,
REDUCE TO 2-5-0 KNOTS

30:26.158 --> 30:27.894
FOR TRAFFIC OVERTAKING
YOUR 12 O'CLOCK,

30:27.927 --> 30:28.895
7 MILES.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.062
WE ALL RIGHT HERE?

30:30.096 --> 30:31.397
OH, YEAH, WE JUST
UNTIED A KNOT.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.631
TAKE YOUR BREAK.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.901
[SIGHS] THANK YOU.
YEAH.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.071
WELL?

30:39.105 --> 30:41.540
SHE RAN INTO A JAM.

30:41.573 --> 30:42.875
YOU WANT TO STAY
WITH THIS SECTOR?

30:42.909 --> 30:44.276
I THINK I CAN SWING IT.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.912
Pilot: CENTER, VANGUARD 939
WITH YOU AT X-RAY.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.546
ROGER, VANGUARD 939.

30:47.579 --> 30:50.016
I'LL PLUG IN RIGHT NOW IF YOU
WANT TO GO BACK TO THE STRIPS.

30:50.049 --> 30:53.052
NO, I'D LIKE TO STAY.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.121
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.522
THANKS.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.998
VANGUARD 939,
WELCOME TO MY AIRSPACE.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.500
WE'LL TRY AND GIVE YOU
SOME SMOOTH AIR TONIGHT.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.069
GOOD EVENING, PHOENIX.
IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.570
GOOD EVENING
TO YOU, SIR.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.611
GET ME MISTER--

31:19.645 --> 31:21.213
IF THIS IS ABOUT RANDY,
I TOLD YOU--

31:21.247 --> 31:23.615
DO I NEED TO GET
MY EYES CHECKED,

31:23.649 --> 31:25.617
OR DOES JULIE ALBRECHT
NEED A SHAVE?

31:25.651 --> 31:27.319
WHO IS THAT ON 14 HIGH?

31:27.353 --> 31:29.388
DO YOU EVER GO HOME?

31:29.421 --> 31:31.490
IT'S JACK HARRIS.

31:31.523 --> 31:34.093
FLIGHT 290 HARRIS?
WHERE'S HIS PAPERWORK?

31:34.126 --> 31:36.295
I KNOW, MURRAY, IT'S MY FAULT.
YOU'LL GET IT.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.097
I WON'T SIGN THEM.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.331
THIS MAN COULD BE
A THREAT

31:39.365 --> 31:40.532
TO AIRSPACE SAFETY.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.035
THAT IS MY SINGLE
CONCERN.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.503
ITEM ONE...

31:44.536 --> 31:46.038
I WAS THERE THE NIGHT
OF THE CRASH.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.207
NO ONE IS QUESTIONING
HIS QUOTE,

31:48.240 --> 31:50.509
HEROISM, UNQUOTE.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.044
I'M REFERRING WHEN HE
TRANSFERRED TO PHOENIX

31:52.078 --> 31:53.946
AND TRIED TO RETURN
TO DUTY--

31:53.980 --> 31:55.547
MURRAY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE TONIGHT?

31:55.581 --> 31:58.150
MARCH 1994.

31:58.184 --> 32:00.619
SUBJECT ARRIVED
INTOXICATED AT WORK.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.189
OHH. HE COMPLETED
ALCOHOL REHAB PROGRAM.

32:03.222 --> 32:06.258
JULY 1995. SUBJECT
VERBALLY ABUSED

32:06.292 --> 32:08.694
COWORKERS, HAD
TO BE RESTRAINED.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.496
AND THE COMPLAINT
WAS DROPPED.

32:10.529 --> 32:11.998
LOOK, I KNOW HOW IT
MAY LOOK ON PAPER,

32:12.031 --> 32:13.665
BUT I'VE KNOWN JACK HARRIS
FOR 10 YEARS.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.401
HE IS THE BEST CONTROLLER
I'VE EVER SEEN.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.036
NOVEMBER 1996.

32:17.069 --> 32:19.972
AFTER A LEVEL 2
LOSS OF SEPARATION,

32:20.006 --> 32:21.607
SUBJECT PHYSICALLY
ASSAULTED

32:21.640 --> 32:23.409
FACILITY CHIEF.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.278
AND GOT A STANDING OVATION.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.547
I NEED HIM. HE'S STAYING.

32:28.580 --> 32:29.982
I'M TAKING THIS UP

32:30.016 --> 32:31.583
WITH THE REGIONAL
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.385
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
COULD MEAN FOR YOU.

32:37.189 --> 32:40.026
I'VE SEEN YOUR FILE,
TOO, MURRAY.

50:40.838 --> 50:42.373
LIKE BASEBALL PLAYERS,

50:42.407 --> 50:44.342
AND HE WOULD SAY,

50:44.375 --> 50:45.776
DON'T THINK ABOUT
HITTING THE BALL,

50:45.810 --> 50:48.246
JUST HIT THE BALL,
YOU KNOW.

50:48.279 --> 50:50.047

53:52.497 --> 53:53.698
YOU COME BACK HERE
AND YOU TELL ME WHY

53:53.731 --> 53:55.500
THOSE BATTERIES
GAVE OUT AGAIN, OK?

53:55.533 --> 53:56.667
QUINN.

53:56.701 --> 53:58.403
AS SOON AS I KNOW
THE RULES,

53:58.436 --> 54:00.371
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
THIS GAME.

54:00.405 --> 54:02.673
OK, COME ON.
WATCH YOUR STEP.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.312
PHOENIX, WE'RE JUST
GOING TO FLY

54:07.345 --> 54:08.979
RIGHT ON IN
AS FAST AS WE WANT,

54:09.013 --> 54:10.615
DO YOU READ?

54:12.950 --> 54:14.519
PHOENIX?

54:15.520 --> 54:16.487
THIS?

54:16.521 --> 54:17.722
THAT.

54:17.755 --> 54:20.391
T.C: QUINN, YOU ARE
KILLING US UP HERE.

54:20.425 --> 54:22.293
OW. OW.

54:22.327 --> 54:24.495
YOU OK?
YEAH.

54:27.398 --> 54:28.833
LOOK AT THIS.

54:28.866 --> 54:30.034
KENNEDY IS SENDING
TROOPS

54:30.067 --> 54:32.737
TO SOMEPLACE CALLED
SOUTH VIETNAM.

54:36.106 --> 54:37.608
ARE YOU HOLDING
YOUR BREATH?

54:37.642 --> 54:39.977
UH-HUH.

54:41.712 --> 54:43.013
WELL,

54:43.047 --> 54:45.450
WE'RE PARTIALLY BACK.

54:45.483 --> 54:47.352
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

54:47.385 --> 54:48.453
IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH JUICE,

54:48.486 --> 54:49.720
SO IT'S EITHER
YOUR COMPUTERS

54:49.754 --> 54:50.855
OR THE COOLING SYSTEM.

54:50.888 --> 54:52.457
YOU CAN'T HAVE
A COOL CENTER

54:52.490 --> 54:53.824
AND HAVE YOUR COMPUTERS
WORK AT THE SAME TIME.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.529
HOW LONG CAN WE RUN
WITHOUT AC?

54:58.563 --> 55:00.798
I'D SAY AS SOON AS IT
REACHES 105 DOWN HERE,

55:00.831 --> 55:03.601
THE COMPUTERS
WILL CRASH.

55:06.437 --> 55:07.438
SUSIE,

55:07.472 --> 55:09.440
DON'T USE
ALL YOUR LIGHTS.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.412
Laura:
TO ALL FLIGHTS

55:14.445 --> 55:15.680
HOLDING FOR PHOENIX
ARRIVAL,

55:15.713 --> 55:16.714
LISTEN UP,
AND PAY ATTENTION,

55:16.747 --> 55:17.848
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

55:17.882 --> 55:18.849
OR SOMETHING'S
GOING TO HAPPEN

55:18.883 --> 55:20.351
NONE OF US
WANTS TO SEE.

55:20.385 --> 55:22.052
WE'RE SENDING YOU
INTO TWIN LANES

55:22.086 --> 55:24.422
FOR SLAM DUNKS
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

55:24.455 --> 55:26.023
PHOENIX HAS SUSPENDED
DEPARTURES,

55:26.056 --> 55:28.626
SO GROUND TRAFFIC
WILL BE MINIMAL.

55:28.659 --> 55:30.961
YOU FLIGHTS
ON THE NORTHEAST RING,

55:30.995 --> 55:31.996
PASS OUT MORE PEANUTS,

55:32.029 --> 55:34.064
YOU'RE THE CABOOSES.

55:41.772 --> 55:43.874
Radio: CENTER,
SILVER AIR 4-9-4,

55:43.908 --> 55:45.810
YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN
OUR ON-TIME RECORD.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.778
T.C.: SILVER AIR 4-94,
NEGATIVE, SIR.

55:47.812 --> 55:49.914
PLEASE HOLD
YOUR PRESENT SPEED.

55:50.915 --> 55:52.583
HEY.

55:52.617 --> 55:54.819
FOR THE RECORD,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.020
I CALLED
NATIONAL FLOW

55:56.053 --> 55:57.588
AND TRIED
TO GET THEM TO--

55:57.622 --> 55:59.890
THE JETS ARE COMING.
WE'RE GOING TO LAND THEM.

55:59.924 --> 56:01.492
WHO'S LAST IN?

56:01.526 --> 56:04.895
TRANS GULF 47.
REGULAR RUN FROM DALLAS.

56:08.733 --> 56:09.900
HUSH. HUSH.

56:09.934 --> 56:13.070
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

56:13.103 --> 56:14.972
UH, MISS?

56:15.005 --> 56:17.408
CAN I GET ANOTHER
JACK DANIELS, PLEASE?

56:17.442 --> 56:18.443
SHH. SHH. SHH. SHH.

56:18.476 --> 56:20.478
YES, SIR.

56:20.511 --> 56:23.481
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

56:23.514 --> 56:24.649
SHH.

56:34.459 --> 56:35.826
AMERICA WEST 46,

56:35.860 --> 56:38.463
DESCEND AND MAINTAIN
ONE-4,000.

56:38.496 --> 56:39.897
Pilot:
ONE-4,000, ROGER.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.699
SO IS IT TRUE

56:41.732 --> 56:43.568
WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT CONTROLLERS

56:43.601 --> 56:45.536
BURNING OUT
BY THEIR MID-30s?

56:45.570 --> 56:48.706
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

56:48.739 --> 56:51.709
SO WHY ARE YOU BACK?

56:52.810 --> 56:54.512
I'M NOT BACK.

56:54.545 --> 56:56.046
BRYANT NEEDED
SOME HELP TONIGHT,

56:56.080 --> 56:57.615
SO I'M HERE.

56:57.648 --> 56:59.416
OH.

57:32.917 --> 57:34.552
I LOST RADIO.

57:34.585 --> 57:36.086
COMPILE A LIST
OF FLIGHTS

57:36.120 --> 57:37.087
AND FUEL LEVELS.

57:37.121 --> 57:38.589
WE GOT TO TURN
THEM AWAY.

57:38.623 --> 57:39.757
YOU'RE RIGHT. THANKS.

57:39.790 --> 57:41.892
CRUISE,
ALERT L.A. CENTRAL.

57:41.926 --> 57:43.661
RANDY,
CALL KANSAS CITY.
OK.

57:43.694 --> 57:45.029
AMANDA.
YEAH?

57:45.062 --> 57:46.263
SEE IF YOU CAN GET
A HOLD OF THE DUTY OFFICER

57:46.296 --> 57:47.532
AT THE AIR FORCE BASE.
SEE IF THEIR TOWER

57:47.565 --> 57:48.633
CAN BE OF ANY HELP.

57:48.666 --> 57:49.667
YES, I NEED CENTRAL
AIR OPERATIONS

57:49.700 --> 57:50.801
FOR ALL THE MAJOR
AIRLINES.

57:52.903 --> 57:54.839
RRR!

57:54.872 --> 57:57.174
ALL SECTORS, FLIGHT STRIPS
DOWN HERE ASAP.

57:57.207 --> 57:58.943
Harris:
FUEL ESTIMATES. JULIE.

57:58.976 --> 57:59.944
Julie: SIR.

57:59.977 --> 58:00.945
TAKE DOWN
THESE NUMBERS:

58:00.978 --> 58:04.281
F-L-2-9-7-2,

58:04.314 --> 58:06.050
6,500 POUNDS.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.653
ALPHA JULIET
5-6-7-3,

58:08.686 --> 58:09.654
7,900 POUNDS.

58:09.687 --> 58:10.821
SECTOR 13,

58:10.855 --> 58:12.022
I NEED YOUR STRIPS NOW.

58:12.056 --> 58:13.190
ALL INBOUND AIRCRAFT.

58:13.223 --> 58:14.725
BRYANT, PALMDALE
HAS RADIO CONTACT,

58:14.759 --> 58:15.726
BUT NO RADAR.

58:15.760 --> 58:16.727
T.C.:
CAN THEY TAKE THEM?

58:16.761 --> 58:17.862
NEGATIVE.

58:17.895 --> 58:19.029
WELL, THE NEAREST
ALL-WEATHER RUNWAY

58:19.063 --> 58:20.230
IS LAS VEGAS.
HOW MANY CAN MAKE IT?

58:20.264 --> 58:21.799
NO. VEGAS IS OUT.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.300
THEY GOT SEVERE
WINDS, HEAVY RAIN,

58:23.333 --> 58:24.769
AND ZERO VISIBILITY.

58:24.802 --> 58:26.036
DENVER'S NEAREST.

58:26.070 --> 58:27.538
LET'S SEE. UM,

58:27.572 --> 58:28.773
THESE FLIGHTS HAVE
GOT ENOUGH FUEL

58:28.806 --> 58:29.907
TO MAKE IT.
MAYBE DELTA 41,

58:29.940 --> 58:30.941
BUT I WOULDN'T
RISK IT.

58:30.975 --> 58:31.942
ALL RIGHT, CRUISE,

58:31.976 --> 58:33.177
GET ON THE HORN
TO PALMDALE

58:33.210 --> 58:34.311
AND TELL THEM TO SEND
THE FOLLOWING JETS

58:34.344 --> 58:35.312
TO DENVER,

58:35.345 --> 58:38.148
US AIR 88,
SOUTHWEST 438,

58:38.182 --> 58:40.951
UNITED 21,
CONTINENTAL 838,

58:40.985 --> 58:44.088
TWA 44, TEXAS 493,

58:44.121 --> 58:45.089
CACTUS 21.

58:45.122 --> 58:46.857
WHAT ABOUT THE REST?

58:46.891 --> 58:48.693
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
THERE'S McCLAIN MUNICIPAL,

58:48.726 --> 58:50.227
THERE'S THE NATIONAL
GUARD STRIP NEAR SONOMA,

58:50.260 --> 58:51.796
AND THE AIR FORCE BASE.

58:51.829 --> 58:52.830
NO, THE LONGEST
RUNWAY

58:52.863 --> 58:54.031
OF THE 3 OF THEM
IS 6,000 FEET.

58:54.064 --> 58:55.065
SONOMA DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE

58:55.099 --> 58:56.601
EMERGENCY CREWS.

58:56.634 --> 58:57.602
WELL, IF QUINN DOESN'T
GET US BACK ONLINE,

58:57.635 --> 58:58.803
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

58:58.836 --> 59:00.605
SHIT.

59:00.638 --> 59:03.007
COME ON, HELP ME
CLEAR OFF THE DESK.

59:04.241 --> 59:07.745
OK, THIS
IS OUR RUNWAY,

59:07.778 --> 59:09.246
HERE ARE OUR
THUNDERSTORM CELLS

59:09.279 --> 59:10.347
RIGHT HERE.

59:10.380 --> 59:13.050
OK, NOW,

59:13.083 --> 59:14.819
ALL THE GUM PIECES

59:14.852 --> 59:17.855
ARE OUR AIRCRAFT
ABOVE 15,000 FEET,

59:17.888 --> 59:19.323
AND THE BATTERIES

59:19.356 --> 59:21.125
REPRESENT AIRCRAFT
ON INBOUND MARKER

59:21.158 --> 59:22.893
UNDER 10,000.

59:40.144 --> 59:42.246
QUINN,
THE RADIO FIRST.

59:42.279 --> 59:44.615
I KNOW. I KNOW.

59:46.150 --> 59:48.986
5 SECONDS.

59:49.019 --> 59:50.921
OK.

59:54.759 --> 59:57.261
NORTHWEST 3-9-3

59:57.294 --> 59:59.296
WILL BE RIGHT THERE.

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.134
MAN, I HATE

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:05.235
THOSE AIR TRAFFIC
CONTROLLERS.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:06.370
I MEAN, WHAT DO THEY
REALLY DO?

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:07.872
JUST SIT THERE.
WHO NEEDS THEM?

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:09.273
WHAT'S F.A.A.
STAND FOR?

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:12.242
All: FUCKED AGAIN
AND AGAIN.

01:00:19.784 --> 01:00:21.752
NOW.

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:22.920
NO.

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:26.290
NOW.

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.093
NOT YET.

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:32.663
COME ON.

01:00:32.697 --> 01:00:34.865
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:00:34.899 --> 01:00:36.400
ISN'T IT FUNNY?

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:38.068
THIS THING WAS ON MY
REQUISITION FORM

01:00:38.102 --> 01:00:39.737
ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.071
I'M GOING TO THE HARDWARE
STORE. WANT TO COME?

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:42.973
CAN YOU FIX IT? I NEED
TO MAKE A DECISION.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:45.375
SUSAN, I WILL KNOW
IN 20 MINUTES.

01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:47.044
15.
15.

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:49.213
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
SAY THAT?

01:01:47.171 --> 01:01:48.472
P.A.:
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.

01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:50.107
WILL PASSENGER
MADISON PERSELL

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.175
PLEASE PICK UP
THE NEAREST

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.077
WHITE COURTESY PHONE?

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:59.049
NO, UNACCEPTABLE.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.484
I'M GOING TO DIRECT-DIALOGUE
THE SENATOR

01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:02.252
AND BI-LINK CONFERENCE
YOU IN TWO.

01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:05.489
SIR, I'VE JUST LEARNED THAT
DULLES AND NATIONAL ARE OPEN,

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:06.891
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS
TO REPLACE YOU

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:08.225
WITH THE SPEAKER
OF THE HOUSE.

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:09.426
THEY DON'T THINK
YOU CAN MAKE IT IN TIME.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:11.962
IT'S GOING TO BE A P.R.
CATASTROPHE.

01:02:11.996 --> 01:02:14.531
CHRISTINA, HERE IS
ANOTHER REASON

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.366
WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE
ATTENDED WEST POINT.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.003
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY FAILED TO
MASTER COMMAND AND CONTROL

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:20.470
IN A CRISIS SITUATION.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:33.851
JEEZ.

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:37.121
I'M COOL.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:40.490
Radio: PHOENIX--NORTH--
3-9--DO YOU COPY?

01:02:40.524 --> 01:02:41.792
CENTER, ARE YOU THERE?

01:02:41.826 --> 01:02:43.928
YES. WE HAVE RADIO.

01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:46.030
NORTHWEST 3-9-3,
ROGER.

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:47.097
SORRY WE LEFT YOU.

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:49.433
MAINTAIN
FLIGHT LEVEL 3-5-0.

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:02.146
Cruise:
THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:03.380
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
JUST WATCH.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:04.949
WE SPLIT THEM
INTO ODDS AND EVENS,

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:05.983
RIGHT, THESE NORTHERN
FLIGHTS BECOME THE ODDS,

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:06.984
THEY DESCEND TO 7.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.152
EVENS DESCEND TO 6,

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:09.553
ODDS BEND BACK,
FOLD INTO ONE LINE

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:11.055
5 MILES IN-TRAIL.

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:12.056
YEAH, BUT--

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:13.123
JUST SHH.
STAY WITH ME.

01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:14.391
HANG WITH ME, PLEASE.

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:15.826
THIS CAN WORK.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.294
THE ODDS BEND
LIKE AN "S," RIGHT?

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:18.562
SLOWS THEM DOWN,

01:03:18.595 --> 01:03:20.064
BACK BEHIND
THE PARADE, AND IN.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:22.232
THE FINAL APPROACH
WILL BE A SLAM DUNK.

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:23.467
WHY WASTE TIME
WITH THIS--

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.601
THIS SQUARE DANCE
THING?

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.270
JUST HAVE THEM
HOLD AND CIRCLE

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.471
AND THEN WE'LL
JUST PEEL THEM OFF

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:28.973
ONE BY ONE.

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:30.841
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH FUEL.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:36.947
PHOENIX, NORTHWEST 393 HEAVY.

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:39.016
REQUESTING CLEARANCE
FOR DIRECT TO THE AIRPORT.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:41.952
NORTHWEST 393, TURN RIGHT,
HEADING 2-7-0.

01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:43.587
INTERCEPT 2-6
LEFT LOCALIZER.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.056
MAINTAIN 7,000
AND EXPECT I.L.S. APPROACH.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:47.424
ROGER.
RANDY...

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:50.360
HERE COMES NUMBER ONE.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:52.362
I'M READY.

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:54.564
Laura: WHAT ABOUT
THE BACKUP?

01:03:54.598 --> 01:03:57.267
NEGATIVE AGAIN.

IF NECESSARY.

01:04:24.128 --> 01:04:26.096
THIS IS ALL LIT UP.

01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:27.464
SO WHAT DOES THAT
SAY TO YOU?

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.200
THIS SAYS TO ME
EVERY SYSTEM IS WORKING.

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:32.002

8 MINUTES.

01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:35.239

UH, PHOENIX, WE HAVE
APPROXIMATELY 7 MINUTES

A FUEL EMERGENCY.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.309
OHH...

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:15.279
UNBELIEVABLE.

01:05:17.181 --> 01:05:19.449
I HOPE YOU CAN
SEE THIS, STRATTON.

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:24.955
I CAN READ
YOUR LIPS, QUINN.

01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:28.558
SORRY, BUT THE GOLDEN GIRL
NEVER CLIMBS STAIRS.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:30.427
UNBELIEVABLE.

01:05:36.033 --> 01:05:37.401

ON FUMES AT THIS POINT.

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:58.255

I'VE BEEN SITTING ON
A HARD PLASTIC SEAT

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.698
DRINKING BAD COFFEE
FOR THREE HOURS.

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:44.468
I WAS PROMISED THAT MY FLIGHT
WOULD LEAVE HERE BY 5:30.

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.203
IT IS NOW 7:30.

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:47.504
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
COULD YOU PLEASE STEP OUTSIDE?

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:49.239

01:06:49.273 --> 01:06:52.276
I CAN HAVE ALL YOUR ASSES
ON A PLATTER.

01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:54.478
TO WHOEVER

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:57.281
THIS IS DR. SHAMAAL
MURKURGEE, M.D.

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:58.782
LICENSED PILOT.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:00.417
I BELIEVE IT WOULD
BE PRUDENT

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.086
FOR ME TO LAND
THE PLANE NOW.

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:03.387
HOWEVER, UNFORTUNATELY,

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.622
I STILL CANNOT
SEE THE GROUND.

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:07.724
IF YOU HAVE A TRANSPONDER,

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.260
TURN IT ON SO WE CAN
SEE YOU ON RADAR.

01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:13.097

THAT'S IT.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.542
TAKE IT EASY, RANDY.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:26.543
I'M NOT TAKING
IT EASY.

THE WASHINGTON AIRPORTS
ARE OPEN.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:33.750
SO WHAT AM I GONNA TELL
THE PRESIDENT

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:35.252

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:37.053
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.
MOVE IT.

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:41.658
SIR, WE'RE HAVING
A VERY DIFFICULT EVENING.

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:43.593
IF YOU CARE TO DISCUSS IT,
WE COULD STEP OUTSIDE.

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:46.230
NOT UNTIL YOU TELL ME
WHEN I WILL BE IN THE AIR.

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:48.832
GO TO THE TOWER AND JUMP.
I'LL CLEAR THAT FLIGHT.

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:51.868
SIR, YOU ARE DISRUPTING
A VERY DELICATE OPERATION.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.339
I AM NOT LEAVING UNTIL
YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION.

01:07:55.372 --> 01:07:57.841
I AM ASKING YOU TO PLEASE
LEAVE MY FACILITY.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:07:59.676
WHEN YOU RELEASE
MY FLIGHT.

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:01.511
I CAN'T HEAR!

01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:03.880
LEAVE, OR I'LL HAVE YOU
ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:07.083
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONE OF
OUR UP-AND-COMERS, STRATTON.

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:15.192
I TRIED TO TURN THEM.

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:16.225

STRAIGHT FOR EACH OTHER.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.794

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.304
NO, NO. THANK YOU, NO.
GET THIS GUY AWAY FROM ME.
