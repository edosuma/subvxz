WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:04.837
Gordon:<i> It started</i>
<i> with 15 of the best chefs</i>
<i> from across the country</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:07.923
<i> competing in the toughest</i>
<i> culinary gauntlet imaginable.</i>

00:07.967 --> 00:09.466
Get it on!

00:09.510 --> 00:11.635
- The platform's
not waiting for you!
- Oh, man.

00:11.679 --> 00:15.055
<i> In the end, only three would</i>
<i> climb their way to the top.</i>

00:15.099 --> 00:16.557
Let's go!

00:16.559 --> 00:19.601
<i> New york banquet chef reuel</i>
<i> cooks with his heart...</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:21.562
I put my soul on that plate.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.564
<i> ...Making an instant impact</i>
<i> on day one.</i>

00:23.566 --> 00:25.024
- Reuel, come here.
-<i> â™ª rise up </i>

00:25.234 --> 00:28.444
<i> he earned my first pick and</i>
<i>carried a target on his back...</i>

00:28.487 --> 00:30.779
- Let's go!
-  <i>...Throughout the competitio.</i>

00:31.991 --> 00:34.158
<i> Houston's unshakable</i>
<i> private chef mariah</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:35.659
<i> cooks with ice in her veins.</i>

00:35.703 --> 00:36.952
I am a force
to be reckoned with.

00:37.288 --> 00:41.081
<i> Team trailblaiser's top pick</i>
<i> delivered stunning dishes...</i>

00:41.125 --> 00:43.667
It's a beautiful balance
of sweetness and gaminess.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.795
-<i> And refused</i>
<i> to let anything... </i>
- Mariah, mariah!

00:46.839 --> 00:48.922
- Oh, my god!
-<i> ...Break her stride.</i>

00:48.924 --> 00:49.882
Mariah:
<i> There are probably some people</i>
<i> who wanted me to go home.</i>

00:50.134 --> 00:53.177
- It's game on.
- I'm so ready right now.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.889
Gordon:
<i> Kansas social media chef pyet</i>

00:56.932 --> 00:59.892
<i> has spent a lifetime fighting</i>
<i> for her place at the table.</i>

00:59.894 --> 01:02.102
That is exciting on my palate.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.396
<i> Drafted second by</i>
<i> team nyesha...</i>

01:04.440 --> 01:06.732
- I got you, girl.
- Got you, too.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.025
<i> ...And she rose up the ranks</i>
<i> by highlighting</i>

01:08.110 --> 01:10.652
<i> her native american heritage</i>
<i> and bold flavors.</i>

01:10.654 --> 01:11.653
It's telling a story,
this dish.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.114
Pyet:<i> I put so much</i>
<i> of myself into this,</i>

01:14.158 --> 01:16.700
so it's more than
a competition for me.

01:16.702 --> 01:20.662
Gordon:
<i> Tonight these three will</i>
<i> level up for the final time.</i>

01:20.664 --> 01:21.789
The stress!

01:21.832 --> 01:24.958
<i> With a $250,000 prize</i>
<i> on the line...</i>

01:25.002 --> 01:27.961
- ( mariah squealing )
- nyesha: Tap that
buzzer right now.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.506
- Let's go.
-<i> ...Only one can be named</i>

01:30.549 --> 01:33.300
<i> the first ever</i>
<i> next level chef.</i>

01:54.615 --> 01:57.658
- Good morning, finalists.
- All: Good morning, chef.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.701
Today's the day that one of you

01:59.745 --> 02:03.789
becomes our first ever
next level chef.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.875
At stake is a quarter
of a million dollars,

02:06.877 --> 02:10.420
and an unprecedented
one year mentorship

02:10.464 --> 02:13.423
from nyesha arrington,
richard blais, and myself.

02:13.467 --> 02:18.679
That's 12 months with
all three of us on speed dial.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.391
Today you'll have to take it
to the next level.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.393
For your final challenge,
you must create

02:24.395 --> 02:28.981
a three course
next level meal.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.732
You'll start in the basement

02:30.776 --> 02:33.360
where you'll have to cook
an amazing appetizer.

02:33.404 --> 02:35.445
You'll climb to the middle level

02:35.489 --> 02:37.990
to prepare
a stunning fish course.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.742
Then, finally,
to the top level kitchen

02:40.744 --> 02:45.873
to create an entree
with a meat as the star.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.374
All: Yes, chef.

02:47.418 --> 02:50.752
You only have 90 minutes
to do all three courses,

02:50.754 --> 02:52.921
but there's a catch.

02:52.965 --> 02:53.922
For the first time ever,

02:54.216 --> 02:58.927
you will be in charge
of your own cook time.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.304
What?

03:01.432 --> 03:05.017
After each cook,
you'll hit the buzzer,

03:05.060 --> 03:06.894
thereby stopping your clock.

03:06.896 --> 03:09.771
The more time you use
on the first two levels,

03:09.815 --> 03:13.650
the less time you'll have
to prepare your final dish.

03:13.652 --> 03:14.818
( reuel chuckles )

03:14.862 --> 03:16.278
that's a good one.

03:16.322 --> 03:17.654
Yeah.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.365
This is crazy!
I can't even believe this.

03:20.409 --> 03:23.619
Three dishes on three levels.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.954
We're looking
for creativity, elegance,

03:25.998 --> 03:29.791
and expert time management
over all three courses

03:29.835 --> 03:32.836
to determine
who is the next level chef.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.173
Mariah:
<i> Time management is something</i>
<i> I've struggled with</i>

03:36.175 --> 03:37.883
<i> throughout</i>
<i> the whole competition.</i>

03:37.927 --> 03:40.427
<i> Missing that platform</i>
<i> was a huge lesson for me,</i>

03:40.471 --> 03:43.847
so I need to make sure that I
take full advantage of my time.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.057
Get a plan quickly.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.517
Pyet:<i> This is the finale.</i>

03:47.561 --> 03:49.686
<i> Everything that goes</i>
<i> on these plates</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:51.021
<i> has to be perfect.</i>

03:51.065 --> 03:54.274
My game plan is just
to not let my nerves

03:54.276 --> 03:57.986
<i> get the best of me,</i>
<i>stay focused, and create magic.</i>

03:58.030 --> 03:59.738
<i> Pure magic.</i>

03:59.782 --> 04:00.989
Right, excited?

04:01.033 --> 04:02.908
- Both: Yes, chef.
- Gordon: So are we.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.994
Richard will be in the kitchen
with you for your first cook,

04:06.038 --> 04:07.955
nyesha will oversee the second,

04:07.998 --> 04:10.457
and I will be with you
for the final course.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.794
Richard, nyesha, and I would
like to have one last chat

04:13.879 --> 04:15.420
with each of you
before we begin.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.090
So, reuel, please,
head to the basement.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.883
Pyet, please go
to the middle level.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.177
And, mariah, go to the top.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.681
- We'll meet you there shortly.
- Good luck.

04:29.561 --> 04:33.897
Reuel:<i> I know the other</i>
<i> competitors are gonna</i>
<i> be coming swinging,</i>

04:33.899 --> 04:36.024
but my enemy today
is going to be time.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.568
<i> Three dishes is a lot.</i>

04:38.570 --> 04:41.863
<i> So today, every dish</i>
<i> has to be perfect.</i>

04:41.865 --> 04:44.658
This is a one in a lifetime
opportunity,

04:44.702 --> 04:46.743
<i> and I'm here to win.</i>

04:48.872 --> 04:50.414
Pyet:
<i> It still feels like a dream.</i>

04:50.457 --> 04:53.000
It's just so amazing
to see how far I've come

04:53.043 --> 04:54.418
<i> as a social media chef.</i>

04:54.461 --> 04:56.336
<i> It's not just</i>
<i> about team nyesha.</i>

04:56.380 --> 04:57.754
<i> It's not just about pyet.</i>

04:57.798 --> 04:59.881
<i> I'm here to help strengthen</i>

04:59.883 --> 05:03.552
<i> the voice of indigenous people</i>
<i> in the food industry.</i>

05:04.930 --> 05:06.680
Mariah:<i> This is it.</i>

05:06.724 --> 05:10.058
Two more people in between me
and the $250,000 and mentorship.

05:10.102 --> 05:13.687
<i> Growing up, we were homeless</i>
<i> for quite a while,</i>

05:13.731 --> 05:15.022
and I want to be an example

05:15.024 --> 05:16.606
to show that
if you put in the hard work,

05:16.608 --> 05:20.193
<i> you can make things happen</i>
<i> for yourself.</i>

05:22.531 --> 05:26.074
- Mm-hmm. Hi, chef.
- Chef, how are you?

05:26.118 --> 05:27.734
- This is it.
- I know you can do this.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.786
- Okay. Thank you, chef.
- You've been so impressive...

05:29.830 --> 05:31.163
- ...Every single challenge.
- That means a lot. Thank you.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.081
This is a big deal
having mariah,

05:33.125 --> 05:35.584
one of my mentees,
in the finale.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.420
<i> This is not just a competition</i>
<i> between the chefs.</i>

05:38.464 --> 05:41.715
<i> It is a competition between</i>
<i> gordon, nyesha, and myself.</i>

05:41.717 --> 05:44.509
<i> And obviously we're trying</i>
<i> to find the best chef,</i>

05:44.553 --> 05:48.013
but it's not a secret that
I want mariah to win this.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.724
<i> I believe in her.</i>
<i> I know she can do it.</i>

05:50.768 --> 05:52.726
It's easy to coach someone
when they're great.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.061
Aw, chef.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.191
We did it, girl?
How do you feel?

05:59.234 --> 06:00.650
I feel good.
I feel really good.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.653
I know you're gonna take it
all the way, but regardless
of what happens,

06:03.697 --> 06:07.366
you are a better chef today
than when you walked
into this competition.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.744
- I believe it.
- What pyet needs
to do today to win

06:10.746 --> 06:12.454
is to get out of her head.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.165
If she can step out of her way
and just let her soul

06:15.209 --> 06:17.000
shine on that plate,
she's gonna bring it home.

06:17.002 --> 06:20.087
And it's so cool
to see you push out
of your comfort zone,

06:20.130 --> 06:22.214
because that's what this
competition is about, right?

06:22.257 --> 06:23.632
Yeah.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.594
- Okay, reuel, you good?
- Yes, chef.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.888
- You've thought
this through? Yeah?
- Yes. Yes.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.390
Time's not your friend today.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.809
So now you have to edit
more than ever before.

06:33.852 --> 06:34.935
This is so close now.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.104
<i> Even though reuel didn't go</i>
<i> to culinary school,</i>

06:37.147 --> 06:38.897
<i> he has more finesse</i>
<i> and creativity</i>

06:38.899 --> 06:41.191
<i> than a chef who's trained</i>
<i> for years.</i>

06:41.235 --> 06:43.693
<i> He's got a lot to get done</i>
<i> in 90 minutes,</i>

06:43.737 --> 06:48.115
<i> but if he stays focused,</i>
<i>he'll have nothing but success.</i>

06:48.158 --> 06:51.451
I've got one extra bit
of motivation

06:51.495 --> 06:53.370
which I think will mean
more to you than anything.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.332
Here's your brother
and your girlfriend.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.543
Oh, my god.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.586
Gordon: Welcome!

07:07.010 --> 07:08.718
( laughs )

07:08.762 --> 07:10.262
you look so good.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.022
( sighs )

07:21.066 --> 07:23.817
I felt like my dad
just hugged my whole heart.

07:23.861 --> 07:27.195
And I was like,
"you know what?

07:27.239 --> 07:30.907
Head up.
Today you came to cook."

07:30.951 --> 07:33.201
you've got this.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.790
I can't believe you're here.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.084
Can we talk about,
like, gordon ramsay
was just right there.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.086
I was trying not to fangirl.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.338
( laughing )

07:45.382 --> 07:49.926
I think you can use
just a touch more inspiration.

07:49.928 --> 07:55.182
- Maybe this will help.
- No way! No way!

07:58.228 --> 08:01.438
I've been sacrificing not
being able to be with my family

08:01.440 --> 08:04.691
on a regular basis, so that way
I can pursue this dream.

08:04.693 --> 08:08.820
- I love you.
- I love you.
I'm so proud of you.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.655
Pyet:
<i> My mom is my best friend,</i>

08:10.699 --> 08:14.534
and this is the most,
like, important challenge
in my career,

08:14.578 --> 08:17.913
and to have her here
and be a part of it,
it's such a gift.

08:17.956 --> 08:21.625
- I'm so happy that...
- ( both murmuring )

08:22.669 --> 08:23.543
I know that it's a big moment.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.046
You just need
a little bit of motivation

08:26.089 --> 08:27.797
to push you over
the finish line here.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.090
Okay.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.637
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What?

08:33.639 --> 08:34.971
Hey!

08:37.768 --> 08:40.727
We're so proud of you!

08:43.440 --> 08:46.191
I haven't seen my brother in,
like, over a year,

08:46.193 --> 08:48.985
so to see his face,
and my mom?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.028
<i> It's what I needed.</i>

08:50.364 --> 08:52.822
Did you see chef richard blais?
That's my mentor.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.907
- He picked me first.
- He's one of my favorite chefs.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.118
I'm ready. I'm so pumped up.
I'm so ready to go.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.537
I'm ready to start cooking
right now.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.164
- You got it.
- It's so nice to see y'all.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.295
I'm still shook.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.592
Let's go.

09:14.096 --> 09:16.555
Please line up.

09:17.933 --> 09:22.018
So, three incredible courses,
three amazing levels.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.104
- Excited?
- All: Yes, chef.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.022
Take a look up there behind you.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.941
That platform is coming down.

09:27.985 --> 09:28.900
Oh, my god.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.026
You have 30 seconds

09:30.362 --> 09:34.364
to grab your ingredients
and create an amazing appetizer.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.491
The pressure
is so real right now.

09:36.535 --> 09:41.162
The fact that we only have
90 minutes to complete
a three course meal

09:41.164 --> 09:43.790
is just like,
"how are we gonna do this?"

09:43.834 --> 09:46.126
on your mark.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.043
- Get set.
- Oh, my gosh.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.962
This is insane.

09:49.006 --> 09:52.215
Go. Your 90 minutes
start right now!

09:55.304 --> 09:57.053
Get set. Go.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.432
Off you go.
Your 90 minutes start right now!

10:00.475 --> 10:03.852
You know the deal.
Grab as many ingredients
as you need.

10:03.895 --> 10:07.230
I'm thinking
I wanna do something light,

10:07.274 --> 10:09.065
<i> but I see the clams</i>
<i> as reuel's grabbing them.</i>

10:09.109 --> 10:11.151
Oh, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.069
Too slow.
So I just grab the chicken.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.904
<i> Definitely not</i>
<i> something I wanted,</i>

10:14.906 --> 10:17.449
but to be the next level chef,
you have to roll with it.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.450
Five, four, three...

10:18.493 --> 10:19.826
- Got any garlic?
- Oh, my god.

10:20.162 --> 10:23.788
...Two, one.
You can grab! All the way.
You know you can grab.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.790
- You can reach it,
you can grab it.
- All right. What is this?

10:25.834 --> 10:28.752
Richard: You need to make
a stunning dish.
Let's go, chefs.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.588
Pyet:
<i> I'm feeling really good</i>
<i> about my ingredient grab.</i>

10:31.632 --> 10:34.841
I'm going to make sweet potato
and pork empanada

10:34.885 --> 10:37.052
with an avocado salsa.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.637
<i>I'm staying true to my flavors.</i>

10:38.680 --> 10:39.763
Every time
that I've done that,

10:40.140 --> 10:42.223
those have been the dishes
that the mentors have loved.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.518
The way you were tackling
that dough, I'm assuming
you've made this before.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.646
It's actually one
of my specialty dishes, chef.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.565
So far, no one has made pastry
in this competition.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.817
Usually that empanada dough
has to rest, right?

10:52.861 --> 10:55.528
- It'll be fine, chef.
I got it under control.
- Okay.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.615
The fact that I'm trying
to make empanadas in a finale

10:58.659 --> 11:00.283
<i> in the basement, for me,</i>

11:00.327 --> 11:01.993
it's definitely a go big
or go home mentality.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.664
We gotta make sure
we're not just thinking about
the dishes that you're making.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.583
You have to be thinking
about that time in your head.

11:08.627 --> 11:09.959
Reuel,
what do you got going on?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.045
I'm gonna go
with some littleneck clams

11:12.089 --> 11:14.589
with a really nice
flavorful broth.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.883
I'm going to make
steamed littleneck clams

11:16.885 --> 11:20.679
with chorizo and curry cream.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.431
This dish doesn't sound
like a dish that normally
would get cream in it.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.642
You probably would want
some wine, right?

11:25.686 --> 11:27.686
I'm looking for richness
at this point in time.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.187
Okay.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.730
Reuel:
<i> Standard procedure for clams,</i>

11:30.774 --> 11:32.107
<i> you have to deglaze with wine.</i>

11:32.150 --> 11:35.068
I ain't got time for that.
I'm here for flavor.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.152
- All right, mariah.
- Yes, chef?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.697
As usual,
lots of flavor over here.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.783
Mariah: I'm gonna do a crispy
batter chicken lollipop

11:41.827 --> 11:44.786
with an aleppo pepper glaze.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.622
This is my first time doing
a glazed chicken lolli,

11:47.666 --> 11:49.082
<i> so this is a risky move.</i>

11:49.126 --> 11:50.458
What's going on
with the batter?

11:50.502 --> 11:52.085
I'm just
on a really crispy batter

11:52.129 --> 11:54.212
since my glaze
is gonna be kind of thick.

11:54.256 --> 11:57.966
Okay. The first course
in a tasting menu,
it's so important.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.927
I'm looking for elegance,
refinement.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.637
It has to be
the perfect appetizer,

12:02.681 --> 12:06.099
and it has to set the pace
for the rest of your meal.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.058
Okay, you feeling good
about the time?

12:07.102 --> 12:08.092
I don't know
if that's a concern.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.227
I just wanna make sure
this dish is spectacular.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.270
- All right, keep going.
Keep going.
- Thank you, chef.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.815
Reule:<i> Mariah doesn't care</i>
<i> about the time.</i>

12:13.817 --> 12:15.066
For me, I want that time.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.819
Ten minutes are gone.
How much time is left?

12:17.821 --> 12:19.195
It's up to you!

12:20.657 --> 12:23.074
I want to be the first one
on that platform.

12:23.118 --> 12:28.037
I want to create more time
for myself later on.
It's strategy.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.957
15 minutes are gone.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.085
15 minutes.
I'm almost done.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.339
Here we go.
Here we go.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.718
All right,
reuel has hit the buzzer.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.178
What? Oh, my gosh.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.555
You used just over 16 minutes
during this cook.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.015
16 minutes?

12:47.017 --> 12:49.642
Okay, I gotta be done with this
in the next ten minutes.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.019
I have to be done with this.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.562
So it turns up the pressure
a little bit.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.856
- Pyet, you feeling good?
- Feeling great, chef.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.066
Okay, you're rolling out
that dough like you've done it
a million times.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.434
Pyet:<i> Reuel,</i>
<i> he's done with his dish.</i>

12:58.445 --> 13:00.570
I'm a little worried,
but at the same time,

13:00.614 --> 13:04.073
I do feel
like the clams were kind of
a safe call on his part.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.034
Richard:
I like the confidence, pyet.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.077
I don't want to spend
too much time in the basement,

13:08.121 --> 13:11.247
but I know that my empanadas
are gonna be amazing.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.792
Oh, ( bleep ) that's perfect.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.085
- Yes!
- 25 minutes have gone.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.046
Oh, my gosh.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.798
Can't serve raw chicken.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.090
I am praying
the chicken is cooked,

13:21.134 --> 13:23.551
<i> but I can't waste</i>
<i> any more time on this.</i>

13:23.595 --> 13:25.386
27 minutes have gone.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.596
Who's gonna get to the buzzer?

13:26.640 --> 13:29.265
Pyet? Mariah? Let's go!

13:33.063 --> 13:35.063
Pyet is down.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.190
I know I'm taking extra time
to get this chicken right,

13:37.234 --> 13:40.610
<i> but every detail</i>
<i> at this point is important.</i>

13:40.654 --> 13:42.779
Just gotta hit the buzzer.
Gotta hit the buzzer.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.697
- Mariah's in!
- Done!

13:44.783 --> 13:47.200
Richard:
That was the most impressive
round of cooking I've seen.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.039
Here we go, guys.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.625
I'll tell you this,
you're in for a treat.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.627
- Wow.
- This is no easy feat

13:57.671 --> 14:00.255
<i> to find one next level chef.</i>

14:00.298 --> 14:03.007
<i> Each one of these chefs</i>
<i>are in the finale for a reason.</i>

14:03.051 --> 14:04.717
We're gonna start right here
in front of me.

14:04.761 --> 14:05.927
This is pyet's dish.

14:05.971 --> 14:09.806
It is a pork filled empanada
with slaw

14:09.850 --> 14:12.600
with a cook time of 27 minutes.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.561
- Nyesha: Wow.
- I think you're mad

14:14.563 --> 14:17.397
to attempt to make empanadas
in that short period of time.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.566
Let's hope they taste
as good as they look.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.777
I have never made empanadas
in 27 minutes.

14:22.821 --> 14:26.990
I just hope the dough
is cooked all the way through.

14:27.033 --> 14:27.991
The empanadas are delicious.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.368
Pastry is cooked beautifully.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.953
Very, very impressive start.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.957
I would've loved
a little bit more creaminess
from the avocado,

14:36.001 --> 14:38.251
but you have
all this textural contrast.

14:38.253 --> 14:42.589
To create something in such
a small amount of time,
just absolutely bold.

14:42.632 --> 14:46.009
And I see the personality
in this dish.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.553
It is so impressive,
damn near impossible,

14:48.597 --> 14:51.764
<i> to make an empanada</i>
<i> start to finish in 27 minutes.</i>

14:51.808 --> 14:55.852
I would be very nervous
if I was richard or gordon.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.854
All right,
let's go to our next dish.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.815
This reuel's dish of clams

15:00.859 --> 15:03.776
steamed with some
spanish style chorizo.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.069
Reuel, how long
was the cook time?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.572
- 16 minutes.
- Wow, that's impressive.

15:07.616 --> 15:11.576
So I am interested to see
if we developed enough flavor
in only 16 minutes.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.121
Gordon:
Those clams are delicious.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.957
Honestly, 16 minutes?
Like superman in the kitchen.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.168
That says guts, balls,
determination.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.171
But I need a crouton,
a slice of bread.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.632
I want to get in there and mop
every little ounce of sauce.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.384
The broth itself is uplifting,

15:28.386 --> 15:31.346
and it's getting my palate ready
to enjoy a second course.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.806
It's an easy dish to cook,
so you banked some time.

15:33.850 --> 15:37.018
- Hopefully that serves
you very well.
- Thank you, chef.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.561
<i> Your boy came to bat.</i>

15:38.605 --> 15:40.563
I mean, those clams
came from the basement,

15:40.607 --> 15:43.274
but the hands that touched it
was meant for the top level.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.985
There's a third
strong appetizer coming, chefs.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.572
- This is a crispy
chicken lollipop...
- Wow.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.783
...Glazed with
an aleppo pepper stout sauce,

15:51.785 --> 15:54.118
also utilizing 27 minutes,

15:54.162 --> 15:56.788
just seconds behind pyet.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.665
- So you fried these?
- I did, chef.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.667
- And then coated them
and fried them again?
- No, chef.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.919
- Oh, you cooked them
from raw with the batter?
- Yes, chef.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.462
- That's a big risk there.
- Wow.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.757
- Richard: Super risk.
- Because sometimes
the batter gets too dark,

16:07.801 --> 16:09.467
and then the inside
is undercooked.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.094
Mariah:
<i> This is, like, my dream.</i>

16:11.137 --> 16:12.595
<i> I don't want to mess this up.</i>

16:12.639 --> 16:14.931
Let's find out.

16:15.016 --> 16:18.184
I cannot go out
with raw chicken.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.686
I am praying
the chicken is cooked.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.022
Gordon: Do you see that?
Oh, boy.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.233
Do you know
they're cooked properly?

16:25.235 --> 16:27.110
Um...

16:33.785 --> 16:35.994
Gordon: Do you see that?
Oh, boy.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.829
Do you know
they're cooked properly?

16:37.872 --> 16:39.330
Um...

16:41.626 --> 16:42.667
Oh, they're good.

16:42.711 --> 16:43.876
Cooked beautifully.

16:43.920 --> 16:44.877
Richard: Glistening.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.673
Thank goodness!
My chicken is cooked.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.967
Wow. They are delicious.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.385
Thank you, chef.

16:52.429 --> 16:53.386
That sauce is fantastic.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.930
You get the depth
from the stout,

16:55.974 --> 17:00.768
and the aleppo pepper elevating
a very humble everyday food.

17:00.770 --> 17:05.690
Three delicious appetizers.
Right, next up, a seafood course
from the middle kitchen.

17:05.734 --> 17:08.985
Reuel, you've bought
yourself an 11 minute lead.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.695
74 minutes left.

17:10.739 --> 17:15.450
Pyet and mariah,
you both have a little over
63 minutes each.

17:15.452 --> 17:19.162
Head over to the elevator.
Nyesha will meet you upstairs.

17:19.164 --> 17:21.497
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.624
I may have started off
a little rocky,

17:23.668 --> 17:26.586
but first course was delicious.

17:26.629 --> 17:28.129
Ooh, goodness, gracious.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.173
<i> Now I have to bring it</i>
<i> on the next two courses.</i>

17:30.216 --> 17:32.091
I'm gonna be way more
aggressive this round.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.012
- What's up, chefs?
- Hi, chef nyesha.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.764
- Reuel: Hi, chef nyesha.
- Hi, chef.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.390
Nyesha:
<i> I'm a trained fish cook.</i>

17:39.434 --> 17:43.519
I spent two years working in
a three-star michelin restaurant

17:43.521 --> 17:44.687
<i> on the fish station,</i>

17:44.731 --> 17:46.814
so I'm very excited
for this fish cookery.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.901
Chef reuel, you're going
into this with a lot of time.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.611
I'm treating it
like there's none.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.072
As you should.
Please line up.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.115
Hands on the elevator.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.287
Platform's on its way.
Here it comes.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.457
Go!

18:04.501 --> 18:06.959
Fish in general
has been a problem.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.087
<i> So I just gotta focus</i>
<i> on what I gotta do.</i>

18:09.130 --> 18:11.422
Conceptualize your dish
and execute!

18:11.466 --> 18:12.882
Reuel:<i> Nope.</i>
<i> Don't want no snapper.</i>

18:12.967 --> 18:15.176
<i> Nope. Don't want no bass.</i>

18:15.178 --> 18:18.012
- Hello, cod!
- Ten seconds.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.972
I want something light
because the next dish

18:20.016 --> 18:21.891
that's coming is gonna be fuego.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.977
Nyesha: Three, two, one.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.021
Platform's still here.
Grab what you need!

18:27.065 --> 18:28.856
Last chance! Let's go.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.858
Whew!

18:30.902 --> 18:32.026
All right, guys,
everyone ready?

18:32.070 --> 18:34.153
- All: Yes, chef.
- Let's go now.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.531
Whatcha getting
done first, chef?

18:36.574 --> 18:39.742
I'm going to get
my sweet potatoes boiling.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.036
I'm making
a pan-seared sea bass

18:42.080 --> 18:43.621
<i> with a spiced</i>
<i> sweet potato purÃ©e.</i>

18:43.665 --> 18:45.748
What else are we incorporating
into the sweet potato purÃ©e?

18:45.792 --> 18:49.877
I'm going to do some nice
warm flavors with a chili oil.

18:49.921 --> 18:54.507
Excellent.
You have 57 minutes left
for two full dishes, okay?

18:54.551 --> 18:56.050
- So please
use your time wisely.
- Yes, chef.

18:56.094 --> 18:59.011
Be careful these chilis
don't burn, chef.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.054
- Reuel?
- Yes, chef?

19:00.098 --> 19:01.430
You have an hour
and ten minutes.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.932
This is an amazing time

19:02.934 --> 19:06.144
to truly conceptualize and
create that vision in your mind.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.312
I'm getting my peas
and my soubise together.

19:08.398 --> 19:12.024
- Awesome.
- I need to add a little
creaminess to that cod.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.611
I'm making pan-seared cod
with pea soubise

19:15.655 --> 19:17.155
<i> and summer vegetables.</i>

19:17.198 --> 19:20.825
I came in with a very rich
salt forward dish.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.827
This is more
a bright taste of corn,

19:22.871 --> 19:24.620
taste of sweetness
of the peas.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.372
Okay.

19:26.416 --> 19:29.041
Nyesha:<i> It's not a "how fast</i>
<i> can I cook?" competition.</i>

19:29.085 --> 19:31.085
I'm a little bit happy
with that.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.546
It's "how fast
can I develop flavor?"

19:33.548 --> 19:35.923
<i> and reuel's dish</i>
<i> seems pretty simplistic.</i>

19:35.925 --> 19:39.051
<i> I'm just really hoping that</i>
<i>there's more depth to this dish</i>

19:39.095 --> 19:40.970
<i> because reuel has</i>
<i> a lot to lose here.</i>

19:41.014 --> 19:43.347
We've all been cooking
for 23 minutes!

19:43.349 --> 19:44.265
Heard, chef.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.766
Nyesha:
Chef pyet, chef mariah,

19:45.768 --> 19:47.602
that means just under
40 minutes left

19:47.645 --> 19:48.936
in your entire cook.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.564
This time is, like,
going super fast.

19:51.566 --> 19:54.025
Like, I think it's going faster
now than it ever has before.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.860
This is our first time
together, mariah.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.528
- It is! I know!
- What a joy! Let's go!

19:57.572 --> 19:59.697
I've been waiting for this!
You're so amazing.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.741
- You're so amazing.
Are you kidding me?
- Oh, thank you.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.410
You're inspiring me
with that ice flowing
through your veins, girl.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.453
Oh, man.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.622
Y'all know
this is timed, right?

20:07.624 --> 20:08.915
What are we making here?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.416
Mariah:
Pan-roasted snapper.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.460
And I'm gonna
get my corn going

20:12.503 --> 20:13.628
with a little bit
of vegetable stock,

20:13.963 --> 20:14.587
try to infuse some of this
corn flavor into the broth.

20:15.173 --> 20:18.174
I started my courses
with something fried,

20:18.176 --> 20:20.635
something heavy,
and so I'm gonna move
into something

20:20.678 --> 20:22.094
<i> that's light, elegant.</i>

20:22.138 --> 20:23.679
- Chef, this sounds delicious.
- Thank you.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.014
What else are we adding
to this broth?

20:25.183 --> 20:29.185
I need some more flavor.
I have some whole mustard here.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.561
Maybe some coriander love,
citrus.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.854
Some spices, yes.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.564
So I am trying
to transport the mentors

20:33.566 --> 20:34.857
<i> with every dish</i>
<i> that I put out.</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:36.525
Saffron.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.945
And this dish
is gonna transport them

20:38.988 --> 20:41.572
<i> into a cafe in europe.</i>

20:41.574 --> 20:43.032
You know, a nice little broth
and a piece of fish,

20:43.117 --> 20:45.117
and you're just enjoying life.

20:45.161 --> 20:48.079
Chef pyet, chef mariah,
you're down to 35 minutes.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.830
Heard, chef. Thank you.

20:49.874 --> 20:50.831
- Reuel?
- Yes, ma'am?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.416
44 minutes for you.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.919
To take these seafood dishes
to the next level,

20:54.963 --> 20:58.089
<i> what we're looking for</i>
<i> is authenticity</i>

20:58.132 --> 21:00.591
<i> and to let the product shine.</i>

21:00.593 --> 21:03.511
$250,000 on the line?
You better bring it.

21:03.554 --> 21:07.348
I'm pushing you because
I'm trying to light a fire
in your soul.

21:07.392 --> 21:10.101
- Oh, that fire is lit.
- Reuel: Come on, reuel.

21:10.144 --> 21:13.354
Mariah and pyet look
like they kinda hustling.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.230
Whoo!

21:14.232 --> 21:16.816
It's beautiful and delicate.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.901
Okay, let me go wrap this up.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.820
Reuel's heading to the buzzer!

21:20.863 --> 21:24.156
Ooh, no!

21:24.200 --> 21:26.867
Reuel, you have 42 minutes
on that last cook.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.703
Yes, chef.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.162
Pyet:
<i> I don't even understand</i>

21:30.164 --> 21:33.416
<i> how he did all that in such</i>
<i> a short amount of time.</i>

21:33.459 --> 21:36.794
This cook is way more stressful
than the appetizer.

21:36.838 --> 21:37.920
This has to work.

21:38.256 --> 21:41.048
Nyesha: You're under 30 minutes.
You have to push here.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.633
Still have that main course
to bring home.

21:42.677 --> 21:45.469
- Oh!
- Look at your chili though.
Be careful.

21:45.513 --> 21:48.097
- Pyet: Ah, ( bleep ).
- It's burned.

21:50.184 --> 21:54.520
It's burned. I don't have time
to make another chili oil.

21:54.564 --> 21:57.440
If you're gonna
put an oil on it, it should be
the most delicious oil ever.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.026
There's so much riding
on the line right now.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.193
<i> I'm screwed.</i>

22:01.195 --> 22:03.237
Best dish of your life.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.369
Look at your chili though.
Be careful.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.747
- Pyet: Ah, ( bleep ).
- It's burned.

22:13.750 --> 22:16.042
You gotta let that go, chef.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.752
It's not next level.
You know that.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.420
- May I get rid of this for you?
- Yes, chef.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.797
- Just so you don't have
to look at it ever again?
- Thank you. Thank you.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.049
Pyet is definitely in trouble.

22:23.051 --> 22:26.594
<i> There's no time to harp</i>
<i> on this mistake.</i>

22:26.596 --> 22:29.889
I know I don't ever wanna see
or smell that ever again.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.641
Things are going the way
that I intended them to,

22:32.643 --> 22:34.643
<i> but I have to stay focused.</i>

22:34.687 --> 22:36.604
There's something missing.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.856
-<i> The potato purÃ©e... </i>
- Ginger.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.941
...Is going to be
what saves this dish.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.486
At this point,
it has to be perfect.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.155
Really happy with
how this is turning out,
so that's good.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.490
Good! I'm happy for you.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.159
- 28 1/2 minutes left.
- Oh, my gosh!

22:50.161 --> 22:51.952
Two courses, let's go!

22:51.996 --> 22:54.705
- Mariah: Whew!
- Gotta get to that buzzer.

22:54.749 --> 22:58.542
You are legitimately
going to handcuff yourself
when you get upstairs...

22:58.544 --> 23:01.462
- Where's the buzzer?
- ...If you do not tap
that buzzer right now.

23:01.506 --> 23:05.257
Let's go. Good job.
Leave it on the field.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.561
Wow, look at those.
Beautiful.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.898
So, first we have here
a dish cooked by mariah.

23:20.942 --> 23:24.026
This is a pan-seared red snapper

23:24.028 --> 23:26.153
with a salad of brussel sprouts.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.781
In the broth,
there are notes of saffron.

23:28.825 --> 23:29.949
Gordon: And cooking time?

23:29.992 --> 23:31.867
Nyesha:
34 minutes and 33 seconds.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.452
Hard to get a broth working
in 34 minutes.

23:33.496 --> 23:36.163
I took a risk. I don't regret
the risk that I took.

23:36.165 --> 23:40.084
<i> I know that this broth</i>
<i> is spectacular.</i>

23:40.128 --> 23:42.294
- No question.
- Fish is cooked beautifully.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.130
- Thank you, chef.
- I was slightly concerned

23:44.132 --> 23:46.173
about the broth
being a little bit insipid.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.800
It's actually delicious.
It's fragrant.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.552
For me, the fish
is cooked beautifully.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.138
Richard:
Do I think the brussel sprouts,
slaw, and the hazelnuts

23:52.181 --> 23:53.973
would've been better served
with, like, a mayonnaise sauce?

23:54.016 --> 23:56.934
I do. But at the end of the day,
the fish is cooked perfectly,

23:56.978 --> 23:58.561
- and the broth is delicious.
- Thank you, chef.

23:58.938 --> 24:03.858
The mentors loved the broth,
and it makes me feel like
the time was well spent.

24:03.901 --> 24:07.069
Next up, chef reuel
has prepared for us

24:07.071 --> 24:11.157
a pan-roasted cod with a salad
of corn and sweet peas.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.950
- Time, please.
- 32 minutes, chef.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.535
Visually, I'm not as impressed.

24:14.579 --> 24:16.620
The peas and the corn
have got that sort of

24:16.664 --> 24:18.831
frozen vegetable section vibe.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.791
Reuel:<i> I know it's gonna</i>
<i> taste better than it looks.</i>

24:20.835 --> 24:24.086
Yo, cut that bitch open,
because I know that
( bleep ) cooked.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.134
This cod a deep
heartiness to it.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.011
Fish is cooked next level.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.721
Glistening.
It's got a great sear on there.

24:33.723 --> 24:34.763
Richard:
Fish is cooked excellently.

24:35.099 --> 24:38.684
Sweet peas, butter roasted fish,
what's not to like?

24:39.937 --> 24:42.188
Lastly, we have chef pyet.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.857
We have
a pan-roasted striped bass,

24:44.901 --> 24:47.943
and this sits atop
a sweet potato purÃ©e.

24:47.987 --> 24:52.239
Cook time is 34 minutes
and 30 seconds.

24:52.241 --> 24:55.201
I spent a lot of time perfecting
that sweet potato purÃ©e,

24:55.244 --> 24:57.745
<i> but standing up against</i>
<i> the other two dishes,</i>

24:57.747 --> 24:59.038
I'm not sure if it's enough.

24:59.081 --> 25:01.332
Sweet potatoes and fish
doesn't work.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.377
Usually.

25:05.463 --> 25:07.004
But the spices
that are in the sweet potato

25:07.006 --> 25:08.756
take this fish to another level.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.466
It's enchanting actually.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.760
I would've loved
a little chili in here
or something like that.

25:12.803 --> 25:14.929
Just a splash of red vinegar
just to liven it up a bit.

25:14.972 --> 25:19.475
The purÃ©e's to die for.
Fish is nailed beautifully.
( bleep ) delicious.

25:19.519 --> 25:23.938
To hear chef ramsay say that
my dish is ( bleep ) delicious,

25:23.981 --> 25:25.731
like, means the world to me.

25:25.775 --> 25:28.234
<i> He's loving the fish dish,</i>

25:28.236 --> 25:30.819
<i> he loved the empanadas,</i>
<i> and I'm just hoping</i>

25:30.863 --> 25:34.490
that he loves
whatever is going to happen
in the top kitchen.

25:34.534 --> 25:37.910
But do I have the time
to cook it in 28 minutes?

25:37.912 --> 25:41.330
You've only got one
final cook left.

25:41.374 --> 25:45.251
Timewise, mariah,
you have just under 28 minutes.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.045
Pyet, you have 18 seconds
more than that.

25:48.089 --> 25:52.758
- And, reuel,
you have 42 minutes.
- Yes, chef.

25:52.802 --> 25:53.759
Gordon:
That means you'll have

25:54.053 --> 25:55.844
a 14 minute head start
over pyet and mariah.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.430
All three of you have cooked
in that top flight kitchen

25:58.432 --> 26:02.518
across a 30 minute elimination,
so 28 minutes isn't long.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.271
Just promise me now
those dishes will be done.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.397
All: Yes, chef.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.899
All of you,
please head to the elevator.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.651
- I'll see you on the top
flight kitchen. Good job.
- Thank you.

26:10.695 --> 26:14.071
- Gordon: Well done.
- Good luck. Kill it!

26:14.115 --> 26:16.156
- Pyet: Here we go.
- Mariah: Good luck.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.659
Reuel: Let's do this.

26:18.703 --> 26:21.704
<i> My stomach feels like</i>
<i> those olden washing boards</i>

26:21.706 --> 26:24.415
where you just scrub
your clothes like that.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.334
That's my soul
beating against my stomach.

26:27.378 --> 26:29.962
<i> But you know what?</i>
<i>My strategy's actually working.</i>

26:30.006 --> 26:33.215
I have 42 minutes,
and they're banking
less than a 30.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.928
- Right, how are we feeling?
- Good, chef.

26:37.972 --> 26:38.762
This is it.

26:38.806 --> 26:39.847
All that stands between you

26:40.099 --> 26:42.558
and quarter of a million dollars
is this one cook.

26:42.602 --> 26:43.934
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.978
It's still anyone's game.

26:46.022 --> 26:49.106
28 minutes.
That is not a lot of time.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.483
But there's $250,000
on the line,

26:51.527 --> 26:53.944
<i> and so I have to make</i>
<i> the best dish possible.</i>

26:53.946 --> 26:56.322
Gordon:
The platform is moving.

26:56.365 --> 27:01.118
Reuel, you have
a 14 minute head start
over pyet and mariah.

27:01.162 --> 27:03.537
Four, three, two, one.

27:03.581 --> 27:04.705
Go, reuel!

27:04.749 --> 27:07.875
42 minutes. Here we go.

27:07.918 --> 27:10.961
I get to peruse this
and take my time.

27:11.005 --> 27:13.881
<i> ( classical music playing )</i>

27:13.883 --> 27:16.550
â™ª dun, dun, dun, dun, dun

27:16.594 --> 27:18.135
<i> â™ª take this, take that </i>

27:18.137 --> 27:22.806
â™ª potatoes, I need,
give me, give me â™ª

27:22.808 --> 27:24.642
<i> ( music ends )</i>

27:24.685 --> 27:25.851
- I wanted that fennel.
- Ooh, damn, he got the fennel.

27:25.895 --> 27:26.894
( bleep )

27:26.937 --> 27:28.937
good for reuel.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.065
<i> I don't care that</i>
<i> I'm the last one to start.</i>

27:31.108 --> 27:32.733
It's all about finishing strong.

27:32.777 --> 27:34.109
Protein, where are you going?

27:34.153 --> 27:35.277
- Rib cap.
- Gordon: Wow.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.197
Rib cap is a chef's treat, man.

27:38.199 --> 27:39.865
<i> I shined once on the rib cap.</i>

27:39.909 --> 27:41.116
I'm expecting
to do the same again.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.493
I knew he was gonna
get the rib cap.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.579
Tell me about the garnish.
Where are we going with it?

27:45.581 --> 27:47.247
Reuel: We're gonna make
a pomme soufflÃ©.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.416
Stop it.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.169
Gordon:<i> Pomme soufflÃ©s</i>
<i> are delicate fried potatoes</i>

27:52.213 --> 27:53.837
<i> that look like</i>
<i> little puff balloons.</i>

27:53.881 --> 27:56.799
They're one of
the hardest technical items
on the planet to cook.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.133
<i> Everything has to be perfect.</i>

27:58.219 --> 28:01.011
<i> Honestly, for reuel,</i>
<i> this is a huge gamble.</i>

28:01.055 --> 28:02.763
Pomme soufflÃ©
is an absolute nightmare.

28:02.765 --> 28:03.806
Why on a night like tonight?

28:03.808 --> 28:06.016
- I wanna go big.
- Reuel.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.602
Reuel:<i> The pomme soufflÃ©</i>
<i> is a risk in itself,</i>

28:08.646 --> 28:10.104
but it's a huge reward.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.564
<i> I came here to push myself,</i>

28:12.608 --> 28:14.900
and that's why that extra time
is important.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.902
This is torture.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.737
This is the longest
14 minutes of my life.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.489
- 60 seconds, pyet.
- Ooh!

28:20.533 --> 28:23.033
Gordon: And, mariah,
you're right behind her.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.035
I'm just, like,
sweating bullets at this point

28:25.037 --> 28:27.913
<i> hoping that I have enough time</i>
<i> to make a next level dish.</i>

28:27.915 --> 28:31.709
Three, two, one.
Go, girl, go. Well done.

28:31.711 --> 28:35.921
I have this determination
to make a rack of lamb.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.424
<i> Trying to cook lamb</i>
<i> in 28 minutes</i>

28:38.467 --> 28:40.968
<i> is going to be</i>
<i> a very difficult task.</i>

28:41.011 --> 28:44.513
<i> It could either win me</i>
<i> this competition,</i>
<i> or I could lose it all.</i>

28:44.557 --> 28:49.059
Three, two, one. Go.
Come on, you got this. Come on.

28:49.103 --> 28:53.897
For this final cook,
the filet is definitely
my golden ticket.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.399
You've still got no protein on.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.192
- They're putting
their protein on.
- Yes, chef.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.861
So get that thing seared
and rested.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.113
20 minutes remaining.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.239
- Right, tell me,
what are you thinking?
- Yes, chef.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.408
I'm just gonna get a nice sear
on my filet.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.034
Gordon:
I love the herbs in there.
What's on there?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.786
A little bit of thyme,
a little bit of oregano.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.747
- Nice. Well done.
- Thank you, chef.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.623
I am going to make
an herb crusted filet mignon

29:11.667 --> 29:17.504
with a potato fondant
and a dark rum mushroom sauce.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.840
- Whoo! All right.
- Careful, mariah.

29:19.884 --> 29:22.593
Mariah:
<i> The last dish leaves</i>
<i> the greatest impression,</i>

29:22.636 --> 29:25.387
so I want to treat the judges
to something special.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.723
Pyet, tell me about the dish.
What are we thinking?

29:27.767 --> 29:31.185
So I am going to do
a rack of lamb

29:31.228 --> 29:34.605
with fingerling potatoes
and some green beans.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.065
That lamb comes out, you slice.
Pink, beautiful. Season.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.318
- If not,
you kiss it in that pan.
- Yes, chef.

29:39.361 --> 29:42.988
Pyet:
<i> I'm praying I have enough time</i>
<i> to cook a rack of lamb,</i>

29:43.032 --> 29:46.992
and I'm just crossing my fingers
that everything goes to plan.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.660
Can't serve this raw.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.121
Gordon:
Nine minutes remaining.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.081
Pyet: Come on.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.541
Keep it going, guys.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.585
Don't you dare take your foot
off the gas.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.504
This competition was never
set out to be easy.

29:58.506 --> 30:01.840
<i> Three superbly executed dishes</i>
<i> in only 90 minutes.</i>

30:01.884 --> 30:04.718
<i> All three chefs</i>
<i> have proven they really do</i>
<i> deserve to be here,</i>

30:04.762 --> 30:08.180
but we're not just gonna give
$250,000 to somebody.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.099
<i> It all comes down</i>
<i> to the final main course.</i>

30:11.143 --> 30:13.185
<i> We're looking</i>
<i> for a perfect temperature,</i>

30:13.187 --> 30:16.396
<i> and who can take it</i>
<i> to the next level.</i>

30:16.440 --> 30:18.565
How's the update
on the pomme soufflÃ©?

30:18.567 --> 30:20.859
To be honest, chef, I'm gonna be
in a little bit of problems.

30:20.903 --> 30:24.571
- If it's not working,
do not waste time, okay?
- Move on. Yes, chef.

30:24.615 --> 30:27.699
I'm second-guessing
this pomme soufflÃ©, because
it's a little bit tricky.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.828
<i> You gotta make sure you don't</i>
<i> over-fry or under-fry.</i>

30:30.913 --> 30:32.079
Come on, baby.
Work with me.

30:32.122 --> 30:33.956
<i>I want this dish to be perfect,</i>

30:33.999 --> 30:36.124
so I hope to god
these ( bleep ) puff.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.126
Aw, come on, baby.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.796
Dance the filet around the pan,
then let it rest, yeah?

30:40.840 --> 30:43.674
- Okay, okay.
- Lovely color on there.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.177
- ( groans )
- that has gotta go in the oven,

30:47.221 --> 30:48.470
otherwise it's never
gonna be cooked.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.764
Pyet:
<i> My stomach is in knots.</i>

30:50.808 --> 30:53.100
I'm really worried
about my lamb.

30:53.143 --> 30:55.060
- Quarter of a million dollars
right there in that lamb.
- Yes, chef.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.854
Gordon:
5 1/2 minutes to go, guys!

30:56.897 --> 30:58.605
<i> I didn't give myself</i>
<i> enough time.</i>

30:58.649 --> 31:03.151
If I serve raw lamb
to these mentors, I'm done.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.572
<i> This is a make it</i>
<i> or break it moment,</i>

31:06.574 --> 31:08.991
but at this point
I have no other option.

31:08.993 --> 31:12.160
<i> This is it.</i>
<i> Is the meat cooked</i>
<i> all the way through?</i>

31:17.835 --> 31:20.752
Pyet, look at me.
Quarter of a million dollars
right there in that lamb.

31:20.796 --> 31:21.753
Yes, chef.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.380
<i> This lamb cannot be raw.</i>

31:23.424 --> 31:26.049
I have to execute this
with perfection.

31:26.093 --> 31:29.761
<i> I have no time to put it</i>
<i> back into the oven.</i>

31:29.805 --> 31:30.888
<i>Please, please, please, please,</i>

31:30.973 --> 31:33.015
<i> please be cooked,</i>
<i> please be cooked.</i>

31:33.058 --> 31:34.850
Perfect.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.935
Beautiful. Beautiful!

31:36.979 --> 31:38.353
Oh, my god.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.773
<i> My heart literally</i>
<i> comes back into my body.</i>

31:41.775 --> 31:43.025
<i> "okay, we have a chance here."</i>

31:43.068 --> 31:45.527
gordon:
Three minutes to go!

31:45.571 --> 31:46.862
Mariah: Oh, god.
Come on.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.113
Those potatoes
are slightly under.

31:48.157 --> 31:49.656
It's gonna be tight
to finish this.

31:50.868 --> 31:51.992
Tell me, pomme soufflÃ©?

31:52.036 --> 31:54.202
Reuel:
Uh, I got one.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.621
Gordon:
They're not working,
drop them, right?

31:55.664 --> 31:58.665
60 seconds.
Start dressing these plates now!

31:58.709 --> 32:01.752
Every detail at this point
has to be perfect.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.420
<i> This is it.</i>

32:03.464 --> 32:04.671
- Reuel: Beautiful.
- Mariah: Aw, man.

32:04.673 --> 32:08.425
Five, four, three, two, one.

32:08.469 --> 32:11.053
And stop. Hands in the air.
Well done!

32:11.096 --> 32:13.680
The stress!

32:20.689 --> 32:23.023
Today was a rollercoaster.

32:23.067 --> 32:26.151
I'm feeling really good.
I left everything out there.

32:26.195 --> 32:29.571
I left my apron, my big toe,
my pinky finger.

32:29.615 --> 32:34.117
<i> I gave everything, so now</i>
<i> I know I have zero regrets.</i>

32:34.161 --> 32:37.788
So this first dish,
created by mariah,

32:37.831 --> 32:41.541
this was filet mignon
lightly crusted in a dry herb

32:41.585 --> 32:42.876
finished with a fondant potato.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.963
- Cook time was 28 minutes.
- Not a lot of time.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.757
It looks elegant,
and the cook...

32:48.759 --> 32:52.135
$250,000 filet.

32:52.179 --> 32:53.845
<i> It has to be perfect.</i>

32:53.931 --> 32:56.181
Gordon: Oh, my goodness.

32:56.225 --> 32:58.558
Cooked beautifully.

33:01.605 --> 33:06.566
The flavor's fantastic.
The herbs are just dancing
around on my palate.

33:06.568 --> 33:09.152
But for me, my potato
was a little bit undercooked.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.487
- Just a little bit.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

33:10.823 --> 33:13.949
- The meat is perfect.
It's right on the money.
- Thank you.

33:13.993 --> 33:17.703
Young lady, in 28 minutes,
that is next level.

33:17.746 --> 33:18.912
Thank you.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.956
I feel amazing.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.541
<i> Everything that</i>
<i> I've done today</i>

33:22.543 --> 33:25.085
I have done with passion,
I have done with purpose.

33:25.129 --> 33:28.171
<i> I know I have everything</i>
<i> it takes to be next level.</i>

33:28.215 --> 33:31.675
Okay, next dish owned by reuel.

33:31.719 --> 33:33.135
42 minute cook.

33:33.178 --> 33:37.389
Rib cap, pomme soufflÃ©,
and a beautiful demi to glaze.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.975
Wow, I mean visually,
modern art.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.978
Pomme soufflÃ© is a big swing.

33:45.482 --> 33:48.692
A prize cut.
Some of those slices
are a little bit under,

33:48.736 --> 33:50.152
but I think you used your time
really, really well.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.987
Rib cap is a tough one
to pull off.

33:52.031 --> 33:54.448
For me, just a little bit
of smoked rock salt

33:54.491 --> 33:56.616
just to counteract
that beautiful richness,

33:56.660 --> 33:58.035
but that middle section's
cooked perfectly.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.245
Very delicious. The demi--
the sauce is amazing.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.496
Thank you.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.833
Bold move. Pomme soufflÃ©,
that's the heart of this dish,

34:04.835 --> 34:06.877
so to do one in the final
with a quarter million

34:06.920 --> 34:08.879
riding on it
reminds me of you--

34:08.922 --> 34:12.132
brave and passionate.

34:12.176 --> 34:13.967
Reuel:
<i> I'm feeling really good.</i>

34:14.011 --> 34:16.762
I cooked with my soul,
the essence of it.

34:16.805 --> 34:18.805
<i> I am the next level chef.</i>

34:18.849 --> 34:21.808
Right, final dish,
created by pyet,

34:21.852 --> 34:24.061
was a rack of lamb

34:24.063 --> 34:26.563
served with some green beans
wrapped in prosciutto.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.815
There's a merlot wine reduction

34:28.859 --> 34:31.401
the lamb itself
is cooked gorgeously.

34:31.445 --> 34:34.237
I don't understand how
you were able to execute that

34:34.281 --> 34:35.655
in such a small amount of time.

34:36.075 --> 34:40.744
I'm shocked that I was able
to pull off a rack of lamb
in 28 minutes,

34:40.788 --> 34:45.207
<i> but I do wish I had</i>
<i> a little bit more time</i>
<i> to let it rest.</i>

34:45.250 --> 34:50.378
This dish is singing
musical notes on my palate.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.756
The merlot sauce with the lamb,

34:52.800 --> 34:53.799
and the prosciutto, the soul.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.300
My soul is very happy.

34:55.803 --> 34:59.179
It feels like the lamb spent
all 28 minutes making
its way to this moment.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.973
I mean, medium.
Medium is such a tough
temperature.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.016
It's cooked perfectly.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.685
But if you let it rest
for just a minute longer,

35:05.729 --> 35:07.562
you could've brought out
more flavor in the lamb.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.023
Well, the thing that lifts this
is the crispy lamb fat

35:10.067 --> 35:11.108
with that merlot sauce.

35:11.110 --> 35:14.736
It is just unctuous
and so refined.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.029
Well done.

35:16.281 --> 35:19.741
Pyet:<i> Reuel and mariah,</i>
<i> they were tough competitors,</i>

35:19.785 --> 35:22.702
but at the end of the day,
I feel good about this.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.454
Wow, three amazing dishes

35:24.498 --> 35:27.833
from the appetizer to
the seafood to the final cook.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.042
Everything's on the line.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.502
This is not something
we take lightly,

35:30.546 --> 35:34.464
so I'd like all of you
to head to the great room

35:34.508 --> 35:36.883
while we take a moment
and discuss.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.051
- Thank you.
- Great job.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.595
- Thank you, chefs.
- Well done, guys. Wow.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.973
This is gonna be a difficult
decision for many reasons.

35:42.975 --> 35:47.018
<i> You have three chefs who all</i>
<i> have had some magical moments,</i>

35:47.020 --> 35:48.770
but at the end of the day,
it's cumulative.

35:48.772 --> 35:51.148
<i> Who cooked</i>
<i> the best three dishes</i>

35:51.191 --> 35:53.108
level to level to level?

35:54.194 --> 35:57.487
Reuel's rib cap,
it's cooked unevenly.

35:57.531 --> 36:01.741
Richard: But the vegetable
components in this dish
are beautiful.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.703
- I think reuel had
the best fish course.
- Nyesha: Absolutely.

36:04.746 --> 36:07.664
The fish is glistening.
Great color on the skin.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.167
There's no doubt this fish
is cooked very beautifully.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.835
Amazing texture and color.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.087
Richard: Reuel definitely
won the fish course to me,

36:14.131 --> 36:16.673
and he was I think in last place
with the appetizer.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.216
Nyesha:
Yeah, it was a little too safe.

36:18.635 --> 36:22.971
- Richard: Too safe.
- I don't think his appetizer
outshone the empanadas

36:23.015 --> 36:24.139
and those chicken wings.

36:24.141 --> 36:25.891
Nyesha:
They absolutely did not.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.142
That first course
from chef pyet,

36:27.144 --> 36:28.518
the empanadas
were absolutely stunning.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.312
Richard: You're making
your own dough? Come on.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.554
Nyesha:
Truly transformed an ingredient.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.398
- Created something
out of nothing.
- Super smart.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.609
But she really lacked
in her second course.

36:35.644 --> 36:38.361
You know, that fish looked
very compartmentalized

36:38.405 --> 36:40.614
and did not have
a sort of theme or vision.

36:40.657 --> 36:41.740
But the purÃ©e was incredible.

36:42.075 --> 36:45.118
It's got that really nice
sweet and peppery flavor.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.620
Richard:
It's a stunning dish.

36:46.622 --> 36:47.704
I just want to ask you both,

36:47.748 --> 36:49.164
how do you get a rack of lamb

36:49.166 --> 36:50.832
cooked like that in 28 minutes?

36:50.876 --> 36:51.708
Was it a fluke?

36:52.035 --> 36:54.878
Chef pyet really creates
amazing dishes.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.756
Mariah, steady and calm
all the way through.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.007
- Yeah.
- Nerves of steel.

36:59.051 --> 37:01.009
Each course,
really, really good.

37:01.011 --> 37:04.012
- Time management from
mariah was tough today.
- Nyesha: Yes.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.056
Her last course
in that top flight kitchen,

37:06.058 --> 37:08.391
it's the only one
that's slightly lacklust.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.101
Yeah, in the end,
the time got away from her
a little bit,

37:10.145 --> 37:13.313
and you can taste that
in the doneness of the potatoes.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.564
I'm gonna say this,
the chicken lollipops,

37:14.858 --> 37:16.733
I think that sauce was the
tastiest thing I tasted today.

37:16.777 --> 37:19.402
Gordon: Sauce is delicious.
They're cooked beautifully.

37:19.446 --> 37:20.695
This is gonna be tough.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.823
All three of them
cooked a next level dish
on each floor today.

37:23.867 --> 37:24.824
Yeah.

37:24.868 --> 37:25.951
It's so difficult.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.370
<i> Pyet, mariah, and reuel,</i>

37:28.372 --> 37:31.122
<i> they've all delivered</i>
<i> such unique dishes.</i>

37:31.166 --> 37:33.166
<i> I mean, this is</i>
<i> such a huge decision.</i>

37:33.210 --> 37:35.335
<i> It's going to come down</i>
<i> to small details.</i>

37:35.379 --> 37:38.922
I literally
am on the edge of my seat.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.799
<i> How are we gonna decide this?</i>

37:40.842 --> 37:42.926
Lots of care,
lots of love,

37:42.970 --> 37:48.139
- very difficult.
- This is a very, very,
very tough decision.

37:54.815 --> 37:57.065
It's been a ( bleep ) pleasure.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.692
- It's been a pleasure.
- Everyone.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.952
Who are all these people?

38:08.996 --> 38:11.621
Come on, guys! Come on!

38:11.665 --> 38:13.206
Whoo! Oh!

38:13.250 --> 38:14.749
Mariah:<i> This is insanity.</i>

38:14.751 --> 38:16.418
<i> You hear the applause,</i>

38:16.461 --> 38:18.420
<i> and you see all these faces</i>
<i> cheering for you,</i>

38:18.463 --> 38:19.587
and they're so excited.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.340
Oh, my god!
There's people all up there!

38:22.384 --> 38:25.260
Then it kind of soaks in,
and you're like, "I did this."

38:27.014 --> 38:29.180
what you've all
accomplished tonight

38:29.224 --> 38:32.726
and throughout the competition
has been truly amazing.

38:32.728 --> 38:38.857
Mariah, you've been
one of the most consistent
contestants ever.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.192
Reuel, you cook with heart,

38:41.194 --> 38:44.362
and it shows every time
you put food on a plate.

38:44.406 --> 38:48.908
Pyet, you use your strength
of your background

38:48.994 --> 38:51.036
every time
you pick up an ingredient.

38:51.079 --> 38:55.123
Honestly, all three of you
have been exceptional.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.919
But only one of you
is about to become

38:59.963 --> 39:03.131
the first ever next level chef.

39:03.175 --> 39:07.052
That comes with a check
for a quarter million dollars,

39:07.095 --> 39:11.056
and an extraordinary,
unprecedented
one-year mentorship

39:11.099 --> 39:14.642
to help take your dream
to the next level.

39:16.980 --> 39:21.066
The person who will be
our next level chef...

39:23.195 --> 39:25.737
Pick me. Please pick me.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.199
Pyet:
<i> I really, really want this.</i>

39:29.201 --> 39:31.201
I still have so much more
to give and prove.

39:31.244 --> 39:34.120
Mariah:
<i> I want to win so badly.</i>

39:34.164 --> 39:36.039
It's time. It's time.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.333
Congratulations goes to...

39:42.381 --> 39:43.338
Pyet!

39:43.382 --> 39:46.966
( cheering )

39:50.097 --> 39:54.224
oh, my god!
Oh, oh, my god! Yes, baby!

40:00.190 --> 40:02.982
I know what I've come from.
I know the battles.

40:03.026 --> 40:05.652
<i> I know the grit</i>
<i> and the fight that I put out,</i>

40:05.695 --> 40:09.364
<i> living out of my car trying to</i>
<i> make this dream happen.</i>

40:09.408 --> 40:13.118
- Oh, my god.
-<i> I never thought to myself</i>

40:13.161 --> 40:16.037
<i> that I was capable</i>
<i> of doing something like this.</i>

40:16.081 --> 40:17.705
I am the next level chef.

40:20.544 --> 40:24.629
Pyet, that last course
was the show winner.

40:24.631 --> 40:29.634
Absolute utter perfection
from the appetizer
to that final course.

40:32.722 --> 40:36.141
- Reuel, an amazing performance.
- Oh, 100%. I enjoyed it.

40:36.184 --> 40:37.684
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

40:37.727 --> 40:41.020
Today I would've done
absolutely nothing different.

40:41.064 --> 40:44.774
I came here to finally
step out of the shadows

40:44.818 --> 40:46.651
and let people know my story,

40:46.695 --> 40:48.903
<i> and I'm pretty proud.</i>

40:48.947 --> 40:50.989
<i> My dad will be proud of me.</i>

40:51.032 --> 40:53.366
This chapter is closed.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.910
Let's look forward to new ones
in this book of life.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.163
- Mariah, congratulations.
- Thank you, chef.

40:58.165 --> 40:59.831
- Gordon: Well done.
- Thank you.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.875
This competition has pushed me

41:01.918 --> 41:03.793
in ways that I've never
been pushed before

41:03.837 --> 41:05.879
<i> and has made me</i>
<i> a better chef,</i>

41:05.922 --> 41:07.922
<i> and ultimately</i>
<i> I feel successful.</i>

41:07.924 --> 41:10.425
I won.

41:10.469 --> 41:13.678
You two, please go and get
some love from your family.

41:15.765 --> 41:19.559
For all of our finalists,
they may not be
the next level chef,

41:19.561 --> 41:21.769
but there are so many
great opportunities
that are in front of them.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.982
- Good job, mariah!
- ( muted chatter )

41:26.026 --> 41:29.194
I like to say
the game doesn't start
until the competition ends.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.988
- Champagne?
- Oh!

41:32.032 --> 41:34.616
Don't mind if I do.

41:34.659 --> 41:35.867
Let's bring mum out here.

41:35.911 --> 41:38.036
- Oh, my god.
- Hi, mommy.

41:38.079 --> 41:41.623
- My beautiful baby.
- Pyet, how are you
feeling right now?

41:41.625 --> 41:46.461
I've worked my ass off
the last six years.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.129
- ( laughter )
- worked my butt off.

41:48.131 --> 41:51.132
And to put a native american
indigenous woman

41:51.176 --> 41:54.928
as your next level chef,

41:54.971 --> 41:57.055
I feel like
I'm a part of history.

41:57.098 --> 41:59.891
Pyet, I have to say,

41:59.893 --> 42:01.926
as your mentor,

42:01.928 --> 42:04.437
you came in
with so much natural talent,

42:04.481 --> 42:09.400
and you pushed yourself
every cook to get better.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.402
I look up to you
in so many different ways,

42:11.446 --> 42:15.240
and I'm just so grateful
to have had you as my mentor.

42:15.242 --> 42:16.866
- This is my girl right here.
- Well done.

42:16.910 --> 42:19.118
<i> I know this is</i>
<i> not just for her</i>

42:19.162 --> 42:20.954
<i> but her culture</i>
<i> and her heritage.</i>

42:20.997 --> 42:22.121
- You did it.
- Thank you!

42:22.165 --> 42:25.500
Don't let this moment
pass you by, girl.

42:25.544 --> 42:28.461
<i> I understand how difficult</i>
<i> and the strife that it takes</i>

42:28.463 --> 42:30.588
<i> to climb to the top</i>
<i> for women of color.</i>

42:30.590 --> 42:33.633
<i> There's no doubt that this is</i>
<i> just the start for her.</i>

42:33.677 --> 42:37.762
Ladies and gentlemen,
our "next level chef" winner,

42:37.764 --> 42:39.764
- pyet!
- ( cheering )

42:39.766 --> 42:41.182
- congratulations, pyet.
- Well done.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.601
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

42:43.603 --> 42:46.396
This competition so far,
I've had so many highs.

42:46.439 --> 42:49.649
<i> We set out on a journey</i>
<i> to find the next level chef,</i>

42:49.693 --> 42:52.360
<i> and today we made</i>
<i> the right decision.</i>

42:52.404 --> 42:56.990
<i> Pyet has heart, drive,</i>
<i> and an undeniable talent.</i>

42:57.033 --> 42:58.741
<i> I can't wait to mentor her</i>

42:58.743 --> 43:02.245
<i> and watch her journey grow.</i>
