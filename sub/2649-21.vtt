00:02.516 --> 00:04.672
How are you doing?
Phil Danoughy.

00:04.792 --> 00:06.266
What do I have to get you to ask,

00:06.386 --> 00:08.719
"What do I have to do to get you
into this car today?"

00:09.500 --> 00:11.359
Well, why don't we start with a test drive?

00:11.652 --> 00:12.457
I'll get the keys.

00:12.458 --> 00:13.523
Sounds good.

00:15.346 --> 00:17.594
Right where I want him.

00:18.104 --> 00:19.206
Come here. Come look at this.

00:19.698 --> 00:22.088
This thing warns you if you
deviate from your lane.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.279
In my car, that's my wife.

00:25.118 --> 00:27.733
"Andre, if you try to kill me,
I swear I will kill you!"

00:29.085 --> 00:30.150
Well, I guess this is
what I'll be driving

00:30.151 --> 00:31.639
for the next 39 months.

00:32.930 --> 00:34.487
This is my D.N.A. talking,

00:34.488 --> 00:36.277
but you do not seem sufficiently excited

00:36.278 --> 00:38.282
about the prospect of
driving a new Cadillac.

00:38.283 --> 00:40.999
No, it's great.
I've just leased the same thing forever.

00:41.153 --> 00:42.821
Part of me wants to shake things up.

00:43.351 --> 00:44.263
I don't know.

00:45.192 --> 00:46.588
Get something like...

00:47.699 --> 00:48.660
Like that.

00:49.850 --> 00:50.796
Oh, wow.

00:50.878 --> 00:53.086
Colonel Klink, that is nice.

00:55.112 --> 00:56.906
We took Lily on her first train ride.

00:56.907 --> 00:58.589
Just a quick trip to Chinatown.

00:58.590 --> 00:59.717
I was worried she would think

00:59.718 --> 01:01.154
we were taking her back to Vietnam,

01:01.155 --> 01:02.392
but she seemed okay.

01:02.393 --> 01:03.516
Yeah, yeah.

01:03.517 --> 01:06.160
Possibly because she was an
infant when she left Vietnam.

01:06.888 --> 01:08.461
Also, Vietnam is not China.

01:08.462 --> 01:10.729
Well, I had a lollipop
with me just in case.

01:12.775 --> 01:13.825
I love that we're doing this.

01:13.826 --> 01:15.985
It's important for her to
explore the city she lives in.

01:15.986 --> 01:17.334
So much diversity.

01:17.761 --> 01:19.108
Keep your wallet in your front pocket.

01:19.109 --> 01:20.465
My shoe's untied.

01:20.466 --> 01:22.089
Oh, sweetie, it is. Here, have a seat.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.267
Right here. There you go.
Hey, hold Bunny.

01:25.973 --> 01:28.917
No! No, no, no, no, no, no! Bunny!

01:28.954 --> 01:31.202
How did you miss that, Mitchell?
Mr. Conductor! I-I...

01:31.203 --> 01:32.021
What?

01:32.022 --> 01:33.315
I was purell-ing!

01:33.648 --> 01:35.372
And it's me! Why would you toss it?

01:35.373 --> 01:36.694
Because my hands were full?

01:36.695 --> 01:38.241
I want Bunny!

01:38.620 --> 01:40.130
I know. W-okay, I have an idea.

01:40.131 --> 01:42.234
Let's catch the next train and
ride it till it catches up.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.600
They don't catch up.
That's called a collision.

01:44.601 --> 01:45.724
Okay, well, do you have a better idea?

01:45.725 --> 01:48.344
You're the one that lost it.
No, you tossed it.

01:48.345 --> 01:49.781
He who tossed it lost it.

01:49.782 --> 01:51.093
Don't try to clever your way out of this.

01:51.094 --> 01:52.309
Daddy lost Bunny.

01:52.310 --> 01:53.586
She means you.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.155
Oh, I wanted a car like
this since I was a kid.

01:57.156 --> 01:58.236
Me, too.

01:58.505 --> 02:00.778
I used to imagine the wind
blowing through my perm,

02:00.779 --> 02:02.004
blasting some Hall & Oates,

02:02.005 --> 02:05.575
maybe horsing around with
my Mr. Microphone...

02:06.156 --> 02:07.795
Yeah, we wouldn't have
been friends back then.

02:08.502 --> 02:09.595
You should buy it.

02:09.877 --> 02:11.583
No, it's not practical.

02:11.845 --> 02:14.239
Practical? You never see a
person on their deathbed

02:14.240 --> 02:16.296
saying, "I wish I'd have
been more practical. "

02:16.591 --> 02:18.526
I see a lot of people on
their deathbed, Phil.

02:18.527 --> 02:19.432
A lot.

02:19.541 --> 02:21.511
I thought you operated on knees and elbows.

02:21.512 --> 02:23.293
Phil, this is a nice car.

02:23.635 --> 02:25.327
And it's half the price of a new car.

02:25.594 --> 02:26.982
If you don't buy it, I will.

02:27.888 --> 02:29.225
What would Claire say?

02:30.387 --> 02:32.321
You know what? Maybe we should find you

02:32.322 --> 02:34.003
something with a little
more lumbar support.

02:34.004 --> 02:36.071
Yeah. You know, with you not
having a spine and all.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.377
I have a spine. Do you have a spine?

02:38.378 --> 02:40.566
I have a spine.
So wanna take it for a spin?

02:40.567 --> 02:42.498
You know what?
I'd rather take her for a spin.

02:42.866 --> 02:44.653
Let's get her top down
and see what she can do.

02:44.654 --> 02:46.817
I'm-no, I meant the convertible.

03:02.903 --> 03:04.490
Well, I just talked to the concierge,

03:04.491 --> 03:06.337
and room service will
save me a bread pudding.

03:06.338 --> 03:07.544
Load off my mind.

03:07.784 --> 03:09.410
You mock me, but "Travel and Leisure"

03:09.411 --> 03:10.754
says it's not to be missed.

03:11.593 --> 03:13.610
This weekend, we're going
up to Pebble Beach.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.150
I'm gonna meet a bunch of guys

03:15.151 --> 03:16.895
I played high school football with.

03:17.287 --> 03:18.760
Man, those were the good old days.

03:18.761 --> 03:22.666
Yeah, unless you were a woman,
black, Hispanic, or gay.

03:22.881 --> 03:24.537
True, but if you were a straight white guy

03:24.538 --> 03:25.634
who played football,

03:26.623 --> 03:27.998
you really couldn't have a bad day.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.070
Gloria? Hmm?

03:30.288 --> 03:31.698
Which watch should I pack?

03:31.699 --> 03:34.343
This one's showier.
This one's more expensive.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.295
Why do you care so much about a watch?

03:36.296 --> 03:38.238
How do I say this without
sounding like an ass?

03:38.501 --> 03:40.675
I'm kind of a legend to these guys.

03:41.071 --> 03:42.147
Not like that.

03:51.812 --> 03:53.118
Who's your daddy?

03:53.119 --> 03:55.135
Whoa! Whose car is this?

03:55.136 --> 03:57.119
Mine! I talked him into it.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.184
Seriously? Mom's gonna let you have this?

03:59.185 --> 04:00.979
Luke, Luke, Luke...

04:01.199 --> 04:02.690
Where is she?

04:02.691 --> 04:04.174
Dad, I don't like this.

04:04.232 --> 04:05.037
Why not?

04:05.038 --> 04:06.859
My friend Molly's dad bought a sports car,

04:06.860 --> 04:08.340
and now he lives in a studio apartment

04:08.341 --> 04:10.304
and dates a girl who works at forever 21,

04:10.305 --> 04:12.247
which she won't be for two years.

04:12.665 --> 04:13.664
Hear that?

04:13.686 --> 04:15.632
Honey, I'm not leaving your mom.

04:15.633 --> 04:17.027
Might not be your call.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.641
Oh, my God, it's so pretty!

04:19.642 --> 04:20.757
I love it! And I love you,

04:20.757 --> 04:22.836
and I promise I'll take
super good care of it!

04:22.837 --> 04:23.873
Can I tell her?

04:24.011 --> 04:25.376
Please. I ask for so little.

04:25.377 --> 04:27.821
Alex, be nice to your sister.
It's dad's car, not yours.

04:27.822 --> 04:30.845
What? But you're too old for this!

04:31.293 --> 04:32.429
It's just like last year

04:32.430 --> 04:34.625
when you wouldn't take
off those skinny jeans.

04:34.626 --> 04:35.656
Wouldn't or couldn't?

04:35.657 --> 04:37.038
Hey. I looked hot.

04:37.039 --> 04:38.854
And you look hot in this car.

04:38.855 --> 04:40.564
Let me tell you something about your dad.

04:40.565 --> 04:42.239
Your dad is a man who knows what he wants,

04:42.240 --> 04:43.794
and he gets it.
Oh.

04:44.398 --> 04:46.153
At least that's what I heard.
You know, I was there

04:46.154 --> 04:48.787
more as a friend and an
observer than anything.

04:49.508 --> 04:51.433
Andre. Hey, Claire.

04:52.371 --> 04:54.198
Honey. Is this the new car?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.367
I know it looks impractical,

04:56.368 --> 04:58.059
but Andre's seen a lot of people die.

04:58.060 --> 04:58.938
I'm not upset.

04:59.898 --> 05:01.345
I'm not upset. It's a beautiful car.

05:01.346 --> 05:03.638
Just surprised you didn't
get the sedan, that's all.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.866
Beautiful. Good seeing, you, Cl-

05:07.867 --> 05:09.428
Mm. Beautiful.

05:12.653 --> 05:13.494
What just happened?

05:13.495 --> 05:15.221
She did not blink once.

05:16.091 --> 05:17.416
Do you wanna come in for a minute?

05:17.417 --> 05:19.119
No, I gotta...
you know, I gotta get to the wife.

05:19.120 --> 05:19.855
Well, do you...

05:19.856 --> 05:21.432
Uh, do you need a ride or anything?
No. No, no,

05:21.433 --> 05:22.587
I'm gonna, uh, I'm-a jog.

05:22.630 --> 05:24.323
Why-why are you running?
I'm just gonna jog!

05:27.050 --> 05:30.438
Lily was up all night because
she didn't have Bnny,

05:31.012 --> 05:32.730
which means that we were up all night

05:32.731 --> 05:35.147
because she didn't have Bunny.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.125
God, she must have cried for...

05:37.490 --> 05:38.632
How long was it, Cam?

05:38.938 --> 05:40.354
Cam. Cam. Hmm?

05:41.126 --> 05:42.143
Oh, sorry.

05:42.272 --> 05:44.046
Uh, last night was rough because Lily...

05:44.047 --> 05:45.582
Covered it. Didn't have Bunny.

05:48.271 --> 05:50.782
Jay, tell me, why are we on the runway?

05:50.783 --> 05:53.520
Surprise! We're taking a private plane.

05:53.925 --> 05:55.893
Wow! I've never been on a private plane!

05:55.894 --> 05:57.331
And you never will.

05:57.332 --> 05:59.674
I am not getting on that little thing!

05:59.675 --> 06:02.702
What if the rubber band snaps
and we fall out of the sky?

06:02.703 --> 06:05.121
It's perfectly safe.
It's a legitimate airline!

06:05.122 --> 06:06.406
Hey, folks.

06:06.547 --> 06:08.322
Whoa. Nobody said three.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.905
All right. Before we take off,

06:09.906 --> 06:11.254
I'm gonna need to get
everyone's weight here.

06:11.255 --> 06:13.569
No problem. I'm about 190.
Okay.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.816
Oh, yeah. In that case, I'm 275.

06:15.817 --> 06:18.733
Gloria, I would never put
you and Manny in danger.

06:18.926 --> 06:20.795
Now come on! Trust me on this!

06:22.165 --> 06:23.197
Beautiful.

06:27.932 --> 06:29.524
It's American music the whole way,

06:29.783 --> 06:31.212
and I don't wanna hear a word.

06:45.277 --> 06:47.107
How you doing there, sport?
Great. Yeah.

06:47.108 --> 06:48.569
Awesome. You know what's awesome?

06:48.570 --> 06:50.851
Is this car has the engine in the trunk,

06:50.852 --> 06:52.877
so that means I get to...

06:53.099 --> 06:56.211
put these signs in the seat, which is cool.

06:56.396 --> 06:57.915
Very cool.

07:03.401 --> 07:04.896
Huh.
What?

07:05.016 --> 07:07.790
Oh, nothing. My, uh, client just wants me

07:07.791 --> 07:09.251
to pick her up on the
way to the open house,

07:09.252 --> 07:11.678
which is great. I'll, uh, drop the sign off

07:11.679 --> 07:14.430
and just swing across town to...

07:14.559 --> 07:17.310
Oh. She's bringing her mom and a designer.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.730
Well, maybe they'll fit in the trunk.

07:18.731 --> 07:19.867
Here it comes!

07:19.868 --> 07:22.202
What? I was making a joke.

07:22.535 --> 07:23.449
What's your game, woman?

07:23.450 --> 07:26.663
I have no game. You're an adult.
You can make your own choices.

07:26.664 --> 07:27.780
Since when?

07:28.100 --> 07:29.487
Do you wanna borrow the minivan?

07:30.291 --> 07:31.243
Yes, please.

07:31.268 --> 07:33.443
Okay, fine. Then you're gonna have
to pick up the kids from school.

07:35.115 --> 07:35.972
Okay, I can't take it.

07:35.973 --> 07:37.419
If you got something to say, just say it.

07:37.659 --> 07:38.739
I have nothing to say.

07:39.329 --> 07:42.211
That just says it all. Well...

07:45.742 --> 07:47.583
All-all right. Thank you, Serena.

07:47.584 --> 07:48.579
See you tonight.

07:49.326 --> 07:51.765
Good news-they rescheduled
my massage for the morning.

07:52.117 --> 07:53.429
Bad news-it's a dude.

07:53.430 --> 07:55.288
Don't blame me. It's your mom's fault.

07:55.289 --> 07:57.549
Do you know how many people
have died in these planes?

07:57.550 --> 08:00.504
John Denver, Patsy Cline, Ritchie Valens.

08:00.505 --> 08:02.219
I've heard you sing. I think you're safe.

08:02.940 --> 08:03.517
All right, look,

08:03.518 --> 08:04.962
the welcome dinner starts in four hours.

08:04.963 --> 08:07.435
It's a 5-hour drive. No bathroom breaks.

08:09.626 --> 08:11.641
Yeah, I think you're gonna
want to hold on to that cup.

08:12.576 --> 08:13.442
Damn it!

08:13.443 --> 08:15.242
What was that?
Giant pothole.

08:15.243 --> 08:16.825
The dash is lighting up
like a Christmas tree.

08:16.826 --> 08:18.029
Tire's blown!

08:18.138 --> 08:19.931
This never would have happened
if we were in the air!

08:20.018 --> 08:21.954
If this had happened in the air,
we wouldn't be in the air.

08:21.955 --> 08:23.609
We would be in rock 'n' roll heaven!

08:25.840 --> 08:27.124
Okay, what do you think?

08:27.312 --> 08:28.932
I'm gonna put these in the subway.

08:29.632 --> 08:31.404
Okay, it looks like, uh, Lily's missing

08:31.405 --> 08:33.222
and we're offering $25 to get her back.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.328
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
No one in their right mind-

08:35.328 --> 08:37.010
Okay. That's all I see now.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.472
How about this one? Okay. Um...

08:39.474 --> 08:42.044
"Missing-stuffed bunny.
Brown and white fur.

08:42.044 --> 08:44.561
Sympathetic eyes. "
What are sympathetic eyes?

08:44.562 --> 08:45.706
Not those.

08:46.699 --> 08:48.225
I just-I don't really love the idea

08:48.226 --> 08:50.142
of our phone number being up in the subway.

08:50.220 --> 08:51.340
Okay, let's play a different game.

08:51.341 --> 08:53.740
How about I be the problem,
and you be the solution?

08:54.162 --> 08:56.071
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be so critical.

08:56.072 --> 08:57.990
I know you're just trying to-
Got it!

08:57.991 --> 08:59.215
Just came up with a better idea.

08:59.216 --> 09:00.826
Took me less than five seconds.

09:09.292 --> 09:10.448
Okay...

09:14.262 --> 09:16.081
I can't hear you. What?

09:16.432 --> 09:17.409
Window.

09:17.544 --> 09:18.563
I don't know...

09:19.831 --> 09:21.374
Gah! What did I do?

09:21.564 --> 09:22.744
Oh. Oh, my.

09:22.745 --> 09:25.043
Yes. Hi. Hey, nice car.

09:25.044 --> 09:26.121
Thank you.

09:26.409 --> 09:28.485
You gonna drive up the coast, or...

09:28.486 --> 09:31.080
Oh, no. I'm gonna do
some errands, actually.

09:31.081 --> 09:33.591
Yeah, 'cause other people
might go and buy a crazy car

09:33.592 --> 09:36.015
with an engine in the-
in the trunk, but not me.

09:36.016 --> 09:38.401
No. I'm responsible.
Mm-hmm.

09:38.402 --> 09:41.322
We have three kids.
You can't pick up three kids in this car.

09:41.323 --> 09:42.222
You can't.

09:42.223 --> 09:43.811
You-it... it...

09:44.261 --> 09:45.829
I'll get you... catch ya.

09:47.805 --> 09:48.887
I'm going!

09:48.917 --> 09:51.098
Maybe I was a teeny bit mad.

09:52.405 --> 09:55.461
So I blew off my errands
and headed up the coast.

09:55.981 --> 09:58.661
It was my turn to be irresponsible.

09:58.912 --> 10:01.296
And luckily, I had sunscreen in my purse.

10:03.517 --> 10:05.749
Well, your strut's shot,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.388
and we can't get parts for at least a day.

10:08.696 --> 10:09.752
Fantastic.

10:10.749 --> 10:11.866
I don't suppose there's any place

10:11.867 --> 10:13.702
you can rent cars anywhere around here?

10:13.703 --> 10:16.036
Know what, sir?
We're not some one-horse town.

10:16.057 --> 10:17.322
Of course you can rent a car.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.044
It just happens to be out for the day.

10:21.045 --> 10:22.097
Unbelievable.

10:22.736 --> 10:24.893
We're gonna miss the whole weekend.
I am sorry, Jay.

10:24.894 --> 10:26.395
I know how much you mean to those guys,

10:26.396 --> 10:28.692
and I know how much they want to see you.

10:28.693 --> 10:31.161
I'm so sorry. Uh, excuse me.

10:31.371 --> 10:33.764
You are... so pretty.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.173
And if you really need to get somewhere,

10:38.319 --> 10:39.426
maybe I can help you out.

10:39.427 --> 10:41.924
Ay, yes, please! Thank you! Anything!

10:44.232 --> 10:47.100
Check it out. Restored it myself.

10:48.990 --> 10:49.831
No.

10:49.832 --> 10:52.996
I did not get in the little
plane at the little airport!

10:52.997 --> 10:55.453
I'm not gonna get in this...
takka-takka-takka-takka

10:55.454 --> 10:57.724
flown by that guy that
couldn't fix our car!

10:57.725 --> 11:00.637
Gloria, it's either this,
or we're in the motel.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.293
I don't like the sound of that.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.301
A lot of amenities disappear
when an "H" becomes an "M."

11:05.761 --> 11:06.707
You know, when I met you,

11:06.708 --> 11:08.715
you were eating cereal out of a bucket.

11:10.656 --> 11:12.753
Hey, Lily, guess what?

11:12.754 --> 11:13.582
What?

11:13.583 --> 11:15.916
Uh, we just heard from Bunny.

11:15.956 --> 11:17.021
This is a terrible idea.

11:17.022 --> 11:18.317
No, it's fantastic.

11:18.465 --> 11:20.828
Bunny said he's on an amazing adventure

11:20.829 --> 11:22.506
having the time of his life,

11:22.565 --> 11:25.550
and that you should pick
one of his best friends

11:25.551 --> 11:27.426
to sleep with while he's gone.

11:27.522 --> 11:28.916
Bunny doesn't talk.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.222
This is going great.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.575
He does now, because- because
he took talking lessons.

11:33.576 --> 11:34.807
So what do you think, huh?

11:34.808 --> 11:37.223
Turtle or giraffe

11:37.224 --> 11:39.489
or, uh, little reindeer?

11:39.490 --> 11:40.705
Where's Bunny now?

11:40.706 --> 11:42.143
Uh, St. Louis.

11:42.144 --> 11:43.094
Why?

11:43.187 --> 11:45.160
He's visiting his girlfriend.

11:45.449 --> 11:46.999
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.406
He has a boyfriend!

11:50.313 --> 11:51.508
I want Bunny!

11:51.509 --> 11:52.542
Okay. No, no, Lily.

11:52.543 --> 11:54.608
Lily, uh, what about Miss, uh, Teddy Bear?

11:54.609 --> 11:58.491
Huh? No? Uh, Dr. Tiger? No?

11:58.694 --> 12:02.626
Mr. Fish? I want Bunny.
I'm going to St. Louis.

12:03.869 --> 12:05.403
Really? You don't know Nemo?

12:05.404 --> 12:06.912
It's on an endless loop in the den.

12:06.913 --> 12:08.362
I have a job.

12:08.482 --> 12:10.038
And then Bodie kicked it to me,

12:10.039 --> 12:12.476
and I dribbled it past Michael
and got it to Tyler...

12:12.477 --> 12:14.577
I was bummed not to be in my new cool car,

12:14.677 --> 12:17.842
so I wasn't joking around with
the kids like I usually do.

12:17.982 --> 12:20.238
And I would've scored if
that kid didn't trip me.

12:20.299 --> 12:22.131
I can't believe the ref didn't see it.

12:22.279 --> 12:23.881
I bet Olivia saw it.

12:23.882 --> 12:25.752
She's always watching you when you play.

12:25.753 --> 12:28.605
Yeah, I know.
It's like she's in love with soccer.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.850
Ugh. Stop texting me!

12:33.503 --> 12:34.372
What?

12:34.373 --> 12:36.088
Corey. He is so clingy.

12:39.487 --> 12:42.356
But, you know, there's something
about driving your kids around.

12:42.508 --> 12:44.234
You're in the front, they're in the back.

12:44.235 --> 12:46.453
They forget you're there,
and you learn so much.

12:46.912 --> 12:49.379
You're like Sigourney Weaver
in "Gorillas in the Mist. "

12:49.807 --> 12:52.027
Except gorillas make less noise chewing.

12:56.132 --> 12:59.254
Once I hit the coast
highway, I didn't stop.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.534
I turned off my cell phone.

13:02.112 --> 13:05.257
I ate fish tacos for lunch. It was insane!

13:05.551 --> 13:07.369
I haven't felt that free in years.

13:08.337 --> 13:11.363
All my stress completely disappeared...

13:12.767 --> 13:14.337
And so did my keys.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.689
I'm sorry, but...
these signs are ridiculous.

13:26.690 --> 13:28.568
Oh, you're right.
I should have used Helvetica.

13:28.569 --> 13:31.055
It much better represents the
urgency of our situation.

13:31.056 --> 13:33.350
No, the lengths that we're
going to for a stuffed animal.

13:33.716 --> 13:36.094
You know, Cam, maybe it's
time Lily learned about loss.

13:36.095 --> 13:39.148
No, she's 3, and I know.
Do you know how many times

13:39.149 --> 13:41.116
I had to say good-bye to a
furry friend on the farm?

13:41.117 --> 13:42.395
And didn't it make you stronger?

13:42.396 --> 13:43.617
Yeah, because I was a growing boy

13:43.618 --> 13:44.911
and they were chock-full of protein.

13:44.912 --> 13:46.640
But it was still heartbreaking.

13:46.641 --> 13:47.774
It builds character.

13:47.775 --> 13:49.400
You know, once, when I was a kid,

13:49.401 --> 13:51.883
my dad left my Luke Skywalker
doll on an airplane,

13:51.884 --> 13:54.445
and I was so angry-
Wait, which-which Luke?

13:54.446 --> 13:55.741
Shorty robe or dress blacks?

13:55.742 --> 13:57.347
Shorty robe. Oh, my.

13:57.348 --> 13:58.787
And you know what he did to get it back?

13:58.788 --> 14:00.755
Not a damn thing. Nope.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.124
He didn't lift one pudgy finger

14:02.125 --> 14:04.902
to make a single phone
call, and I got over it.

14:04.903 --> 14:06.102
Yeah, well, I want you and Lily

14:06.103 --> 14:07.673
to have the same healthy relationship

14:07.674 --> 14:09.635
you and your father have. For sure.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.304
All right, give me these flyers.

14:12.864 --> 14:14.941
I'm gonna take everything to
this side of the homeless guy.

14:14.942 --> 14:16.746
Mitchell! Sorry, what are
we supposed to say now?

14:16.747 --> 14:18.244
Home-challenged? Or...

14:18.267 --> 14:19.567
No, look!

14:20.780 --> 14:22.801
Oh, my God! It's Bunny!

14:22.802 --> 14:23.913
Oh, Lily's gonna be so happy.

14:23.914 --> 14:25.645
Oh, that's so great. Go ahead and get it.

14:25.784 --> 14:27.032
What, me?
Yeah.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.261
Why should I go and get it?

14:28.262 --> 14:29.516
Well, I-I'm not gonna do it.

14:29.517 --> 14:30.523
Why? I spotted it.

14:30.524 --> 14:31.423
You're closer.

14:31.424 --> 14:32.920
It's your journey. Luke Skywalker?

14:32.921 --> 14:34.566
Pattern-breaking?
Your father? Get in there.

14:34.567 --> 14:35.569
Fine.

14:37.773 --> 14:39.028
Sir-hi, sir.

14:40.282 --> 14:41.518
Hello, you-you...

14:44.170 --> 14:45.520
Hello.

14:46.148 --> 14:47.786
Yeah. Hello.

14:49.450 --> 14:51.776
He-hello? Sir...

14:51.931 --> 14:53.564
I- I can't... oh, for God sakes!

15:00.661 --> 15:02.010
Let her hate us. You turned out great.

15:02.011 --> 15:03.867
I did, didn't I? You're a big lawyer.

15:10.139 --> 15:12.008
This is not the massage I had in mind.

15:12.192 --> 15:13.179
All right.

15:15.390 --> 15:16.287
Okay.

15:16.391 --> 15:18.612
In about an hour, a train goes through town

15:18.613 --> 15:20.368
that will get us close to pebble beach.

15:20.806 --> 15:23.273
Now it's not technically
a- a passenger train,

15:23.274 --> 15:25.193
so it won't be stopping.
What?

15:25.194 --> 15:26.771
So we gotta get running real good.

15:26.772 --> 15:28.861
No high-heeled shoes.
And it wouldn't be wrong

15:28.862 --> 15:30.801
if we took that blanket
with us, either, huh?

15:30.925 --> 15:33.680
So what do you say?
Anybody up for a hobo adventure?

15:33.681 --> 15:35.447
If we're voting, I'm a "no. "

15:36.352 --> 15:38.018
Manny, we're gonna be right back.

15:38.233 --> 15:40.984
We're gonna get some ice from
the machine in the parking lot.

15:42.708 --> 15:43.744
Classy.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.372
Jay, this is getting crazy. Is it worth it?

15:50.373 --> 15:51.492
I wanna see the old gang.

15:51.493 --> 15:54.213
Do you wanna see them or you
want to show off to them?

15:54.214 --> 15:56.889
The private plane, the fancy watch.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.118
You still want to feel

15:58.119 --> 16:00.196
that you're the big kahuna on the campus.

16:00.197 --> 16:02.213
That's not it. That's not even a thing.

16:02.214 --> 16:04.040
You know what? I'm taking Manny home.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.727
If you want to go in the
takka-takka-takka-takka,

16:06.728 --> 16:08.712
okay. Go to Pebble Beach by yourself.

16:08.713 --> 16:10.328
No, what? That's not the plan.

16:10.873 --> 16:12.098
If you wanna go there so bad,

16:12.099 --> 16:13.638
that's the only way you're gonna get there.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.319
I'm not trying to get me there.

16:15.499 --> 16:16.726
I'm trying to get you there!

16:17.303 --> 16:18.545
What? Look...

16:20.869 --> 16:24.885
I may have exaggerated the size...
kahuna I was.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.498
I may not...

16:27.662 --> 16:30.479
technically have been a kahuna.

16:31.817 --> 16:35.310
I was shy, and I spent most of my time...

16:37.210 --> 16:38.337
on the bench.

16:38.616 --> 16:40.049
But you always made it sound like you-

16:40.050 --> 16:41.954
Oh, I know what I made it sound like.

16:45.842 --> 16:47.548
People didn't expect much from me,

16:49.068 --> 16:50.112
and, um...

16:50.776 --> 16:52.058
They certainly didn't expect me

16:52.059 --> 16:55.296
to end up with... somebody like you.

16:57.368 --> 16:59.298
So this is all about you

16:59.427 --> 17:02.476
parading me around like a trophy?

17:03.829 --> 17:04.768
Yes.

17:04.769 --> 17:06.380
Why didn't you say so?

17:06.603 --> 17:07.933
I can be a trophy!

17:09.324 --> 17:13.050
Come on. We need to get
this up to Pebble Beach.

17:13.214 --> 17:15.923
Manny! We're leaving! Get ready!

17:16.492 --> 17:18.660
Oh, good. If we get out of
here in the next ten minutes,

17:18.661 --> 17:20.332
we don't have to pay for the second hour.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.881
How you doing there, sport?

17:27.490 --> 17:29.429
I'm sorry. That's okay.

17:30.098 --> 17:31.199
Thanks.

17:31.434 --> 17:32.532
So...

17:32.642 --> 17:34.267
Whatcha doing all the way up here?

17:37.102 --> 17:38.468
Did someone snap?

17:38.542 --> 17:39.962
A little. Yeah.

17:40.117 --> 17:42.557
I was mad at you for buying
that stupid sports car.

17:42.558 --> 17:43.709
I knew it!

17:43.710 --> 17:44.881
And I was wrong.

17:46.002 --> 17:48.867
It's a great car. God, I had the best day.

17:49.254 --> 17:50.899
Phil, I did cartwheels.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.325
Without me?
Mm-hmm.

17:52.903 --> 17:53.805
Yeah.

17:59.183 --> 18:01.546
Hey, did you know there's a
girl with a crush on Luke?

18:01.547 --> 18:03.141
Olivia. Yeah.

18:05.726 --> 18:07.775
Oh, and Haley's totally done with Corey.

18:08.065 --> 18:09.016
That's new.

18:09.569 --> 18:11.308
Alex is teaching herself Chinese

18:11.309 --> 18:13.582
so she'll be useful when
they finish buying us.

18:14.202 --> 18:15.694
She's so weird.

18:18.942 --> 18:20.956
I really want to be able
to drive the kids around.

18:22.032 --> 18:24.821
I need a bigger car for work.
I made a mistake.

18:24.822 --> 18:28.075
No, you didn't. You bought it for a reason.

18:33.347 --> 18:34.968
When did we stop coming to the beach?

18:36.521 --> 18:37.591
I think it was when Alex

18:37.592 --> 18:39.927
started printing out water quality reports.

18:40.456 --> 18:42.179
She'll be China's problem soon.

18:43.428 --> 18:44.447
You know...

18:45.550 --> 18:47.579
We don't need a sports car to get out here.

18:48.271 --> 18:50.366
Mm. We should just make a pact.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.443
Once a month, we get out to the beach.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.689
And we tell everyone we're running errands.

18:56.690 --> 18:57.894
Yeah. Yeah.

19:04.457 --> 19:06.198
So you didn't get to the dry cleaner?

19:08.766 --> 19:10.161
They say the important thing in life

19:10.162 --> 19:11.663
isn't the destination.

19:13.860 --> 19:14.919
It's the journey,

19:16.576 --> 19:18.564
the challenges you face along the way...

19:20.958 --> 19:23.099
The unexpected twists and turns...

19:24.608 --> 19:26.275
The disappointments you overcome.

19:26.472 --> 19:28.403
Look what I found on the Internet.

19:28.404 --> 19:31.707
Oh, my God! It's Luke
Skywalker in his shorty robe!

19:31.708 --> 19:33.450
I love it, Cam-
No. Mine!

19:33.817 --> 19:34.753
But they're wrong.

19:34.754 --> 19:36.372
It's all about the destination,

19:36.779 --> 19:38.250
especially when the destination

19:38.251 --> 19:40.343
is your amazing oceanfront hotel.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.298
Thank you again, Serena.

19:42.322 --> 19:44.716
Warmest regards, Manny Delgado.

19:44.921 --> 19:45.666
What's he doing?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.658
He's sending flowers to the concierge.

19:47.659 --> 19:49.331
Oh, jeez. Hey...

19:49.952 --> 19:50.962
Credit card.

19:56.421 --> 19:57.743
She wore you down, didn't she?

19:57.744 --> 19:59.146
This is not about Claire.

19:59.147 --> 20:00.863
I really want to sell you the car.

20:01.192 --> 20:04.188
It's sad. She got you to believe that.

20:04.189 --> 20:05.450
No, I...

20:05.451 --> 20:07.296
Turns out I'm just not a convertible guy.

20:07.954 --> 20:09.682
Well, your loss is my gain.

20:10.263 --> 20:12.094
It's a sweet ride, Phil. Right?

20:12.095 --> 20:13.236
It really is.

20:18.390 --> 20:19.520
Uh-oh. What?

20:20.024 --> 20:21.758
I'm getting, like, a whiff of mildew.

20:22.812 --> 20:23.940
I don't smell anything.

20:26.452 --> 20:27.845
Yep. That's mildew.

20:27.933 --> 20:29.766
Huh?
This car's been in the flood.

20:29.767 --> 20:31.151
It's a Katrina car!

20:31.414 --> 20:34.271
I'm offended that you tried to
sell me a Katrina car, Phil!

20:34.272 --> 20:36.062
Your wife won't let you have
a convertible, will she?

20:36.107 --> 20:38.210
We will never know,
'cause I'm afraid to ask.

20:38.835 --> 20:39.970
See you later, Phil.

20:42.953 --> 20:44.290
Why are you running again?

20:44.779 --> 20:50.560
