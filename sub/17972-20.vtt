All I wanted to do
was make my Dad jealous,

19:58.712 --> 20:01.279
and you're too lame
to even help me do that.

20:01.281 --> 20:03.047
Jealous? Why?

20:03.049 --> 20:05.183
Because you ditched me
for Cleveland, Jr.

20:05.185 --> 20:07.135
Come on, Rallo.
Junior needs help.

20:07.137 --> 20:08.870
Look where he comes from.

20:08.872 --> 20:12.107
That's assault.
I'm gonna sue you all.

20:12.109 --> 20:16.378
But you came from my groins.
You were born cool.

Hey, Junior.
Where's your little girlfriend?

what that means.

20:24.621 --> 20:26.554
Well, that's understandable.

20:26.556 --> 20:29.124
Did you mean all that
embarrassing stuff you said

20:29.126 --> 20:30.892
about doing this for my love?

20:30.894 --> 20:33.494
Yeah.
I thought that was nice.

20:33.496 --> 20:36.281
And being nice is more important
than being cool.

20:36.283 --> 20:41.586
And maybe this makes me uncool,
but I love you, Dad.

20:41.588 --> 20:45.507
It does make you uncool.

20:45.509 --> 20:48.911
Come on, son. Let's go home.

20:48.913 --> 20:51.246
What a stressful experience.
