WEBVTT

00:00.751 --> 00:02.001
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.085 --> 00:03.212
Madre mia!

00:03.253 --> 00:04.171
I wouldn't mind going a couple

00:04.213 --> 00:04.880
rounds with you.

00:04.922 --> 00:05.422
Oh, yeah?

00:05.464 --> 00:07.132
Yeah. Wouldn't mind boxing, either.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.468
You can function fully on one kidney.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.260
That's what the doctors say.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.762
So it's really not that much to worry about.

00:11.803 --> 00:12.596
It's cancer.

00:12.638 --> 00:13.430
Yeah. It's-

00:13.931 --> 00:14.765
Cancer.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.601
Goddamn, he looks like he's

00:17.643 --> 00:19.019
on death's doorstep, you know?

00:19.061 --> 00:20.187
I love you, sean.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.980
What the hell are you doing?

00:23.482 --> 00:25.150
Just telling him how I feel.

00:25.192 --> 00:25.984
That's what you're supposed to do.

00:26.026 --> 00:26.777
You're supposed to tell them.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.028
It helps them come back.

00:28.070 --> 00:28.862
You know if it was me lying there,

00:28.904 --> 00:30.113
you leaned over and told me

00:30.155 --> 00:31.198
how much you loved me,

00:31.240 --> 00:32.281
I'd run into the light.

00:32.406 --> 00:33.867
So I asked mickey for the dvd

00:33.909 --> 00:35.118
the old home movies, you know,

00:35.160 --> 00:36.620
the ones we all watched together

00:36.662 --> 00:38.080
Well, I put it in the machine,

00:38.455 --> 00:40.457
and I poured 2 big

00:41.166 --> 00:44.670
And then I drank them real slow

00:45.212 --> 00:46.922
And get ready for the next surprise

00:46.964 --> 00:49.466
I started bawling my eyes out!

00:49.508 --> 00:50.509
What do you want from me?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.635
Just to be with you.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.553
Why me?

00:52.594 --> 00:53.887
You're the only man

00:54.096 --> 00:56.181
that never felt like a trick

00:56.223 --> 00:57.599
or a mark to me.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.268
Words every man yearns to hear.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.602
I didn't know you think that

01:00.644 --> 01:01.645
having a couple of belts

01:01.895 --> 01:03.981
before you watch these home movies is

01:04.022 --> 01:04.815
I don't know,

01:04.857 --> 01:06.733
going to give you some kind of
emotional release

01:06.984 --> 01:08.193
That's just bullshit.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.091
You're still gonna wake up

01:10.126 --> 01:11.071
with a head full of sirens.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.241
And your father's still gonna be dead.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.534
A couple of drunken tears

01:15.576 --> 01:16.577
aren't going to change any of that.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.913
But I guess that's for me to

01:19.955 --> 01:21.123
know and for you to find out,

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074

01:34.094 --> 01:36.138
Ok, ladies, come with me to the left.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.223
Garrity, take this hallway to the right.

02:01.538 --> 02:08.503
*How long have I been waiting for*
*a boy worth celebrating, *

02:08.544 --> 02:15.052
*and devastating, handsome, brawny, brave *
*and true*

02:17.012 --> 02:20.057
*My heart could not be gladder, *

02:20.432 --> 02:23.560
*there you are and there's your ladder, *

02:23.852 --> 02:26.396
*feels like love, it does, *

02:27.022 --> 02:32.110
*I know it's real because*

02:33.111 --> 02:38.492
*you take my breath away, *

02:39.117 --> 02:42.746
*leave me winded, *

02:42.996 --> 02:47.084
*gasping for air, *

02:47.125 --> 02:52.965
*well, the newness of you has me *
*clearly completely ecstatic, *

02:54.174 --> 02:58.387
*speaking respitorially-*

02:59.388 --> 03:01.223
*I'm asthmatic-*

03:01.515 --> 03:03.725
*For you, *

03:04.768 --> 03:07.729
*take my breath away-*

03:07.896 --> 03:09.606
Sorry. Just give me a second.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.696
*Rasping and spent, *

03:15.988 --> 03:18.699
*while your touch is enchanting, *

03:18.740 --> 03:21.451
*the panting that follows is not, *

03:22.536 --> 03:24.872
*but so what? *

03:25.914 --> 03:29.251
*you take my breath away*

03:31.086 --> 03:37.426
*I take your breath away, *

03:37.968 --> 03:40.429
*leave you wheezing, *

03:40.721 --> 03:44.474
*light-headed and weak, *

03:45.017 --> 03:47.060
*take your place at my side*

03:47.102 --> 03:51.607
*and together our future we'll tailor*

03:52.441 --> 03:56.320
*Just as long as we keep close at hand-*

03:57.321 --> 03:59.489
*An inhaler, *

03:59.698 --> 04:01.533
*for you*

04:02.701 --> 04:04.328
*take my-*

04:04.786 --> 04:06.330
go ahead, you do it. I'll catch up.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.000
Don't fight it, kid.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.335
Walk towards the light.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.004
Listen, relax.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.631
I'm trying to put you out of your misery.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.550
Oh, you want to play tough?

04:18.716 --> 04:19.760
What are you doing?

04:19.801 --> 04:20.844
I'm baking a pie.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.804
What do you think I'm
doing? -I gotta get somebody

04:22.888 --> 04:24.264
Don't bother, kid.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.599
I disconnected it.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.142
What do you think, I'm new?

04:27.184 --> 04:28.727
Listen to me, pal.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.145
You got the cancer.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.481
Maggie told me you took a turn for the worse.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.316
I came over to try to end it for you

04:34.358 --> 04:35.400
before it turns ugly.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.736
Why did my mom or terrence

04:37.778 --> 04:38.946
or the doctors tell me that

04:38.987 --> 04:40.489
I was taking a turn for the worse?

04:40.531 --> 04:42.616
They never tell their patients the truth.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.077
Be like putting a bullet in your head.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.079
Takes whatever little hope you may have

04:47.120 --> 04:48.288
and crushes it like a bug.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.164
I don't care, teddy.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.082
I just-I really want to live,

04:50.123 --> 04:52.417
ok? Can you just put the pillow down, please?

04:53.544 --> 04:55.003
Yeah, just put it down
over there. That's good.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.505
Ok. -Ok?

04:56.547 --> 04:57.798
It's your life, your choice.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.049
Yeah. My choice.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.676
Thanks, ted.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.220
Did you mention maggie before,

05:03.303 --> 05:05.556
or

05:05.597 --> 05:07.099
No, no, I mentioned maggie.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.559
She spoke to the doctors.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.601
As your ex-wife,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.812
she's still considered immediate family.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.730
She broke the news to me.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.899
Said she was going to
come by and visit today.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.776
Pay her last respects.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.821
What is it, bro?

05:22.364 --> 05:27.703
Did you say that maggie
was coming here today?

05:27.744 --> 05:28.662
Yeah.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.622
Ok. Do me a favor.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.499
Anything, pal, you name it.

05:34.585 --> 05:35.669
Get the pillow.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.677
*on another day*

05:43.719 --> 05:45.470
*c'mon, c'mon, *

05:45.512 --> 05:47.347
*with these ropes I tied, *

05:47.389 --> 05:48.724
*can we do no wrong? *

05:48.932 --> 05:52.060
*Now we grieve,'cause now is gone, *

05:52.102 --> 05:55.397
*things were good when we were young, *

05:55.439 --> 05:56.648
*with my teeth locked down, *

05:56.857 --> 05:58.275
*I can see the blood, *

05:58.525 --> 06:01.653
*of a thousand men *
*who have come and gone, *

06:01.904 --> 06:05.032
*now we grieve,'cause now is gone, *

06:05.073 --> 06:08.160
*things were good when we were young, *

06:08.202 --> 06:09.870
*is it safe to say? *

06:09.912 --> 06:13.040
*C'mon, c'mon, was it right to leave? *

06:13.207 --> 06:16.251
*C'mon, c'mon, will I ever learn? *

06:16.376 --> 06:21.465
*C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon*

06:42.402 --> 06:43.362
What do we got?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.989
No one in the burning vehicle
as far as we can tell.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.367
Couple of bodies got thrown out on impact,
both dead.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.994
Ok, sean, franco, take the popover.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.704
Tommy, you guys check the bodies.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.248
Hey, what the hell is that?

06:54.957 --> 06:57.125
Witnesses say that was one
of the tiny smart-type cars.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.419
And whoever was behind the wheel
sure as hell ain't coming back out.

06:59.503 --> 07:00.671
Whoo, shit!

07:01.255 --> 07:02.798
Yeah, baby, it's a hot one.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.300
See, if cars ran on ethanol

07:05.509 --> 07:08.387
and corn, wouldn't be as much fire as this.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.972
Yeah, if cars ran on corn,

07:10.013 --> 07:11.098
next time we show up to one of these crashes,

07:11.139 --> 07:12.474
all we need to bring is like, you know

07:12.516 --> 07:13.517
ribs and potato salad.

07:13.559 --> 07:16.186
I know, right? What's
up with this new shorty,

07:16.228 --> 07:17.604
the boxer? She hot?

07:17.646 --> 07:18.897
Oh, yeah, man, she's a dime piece.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.482
You'll see her at the
fight next week, no doubt.

07:20.524 --> 07:21.567
She's not gonna come over

07:21.608 --> 07:23.902
and try to punch on me
and knock me out, is she?

07:23.944 --> 07:24.945
That depends on how you act, man,

07:24.987 --> 07:26.238
but based on your relationship with colleen,

07:26.280 --> 07:27.906
that'd be just the thing to turn your
little freaky ass on,

07:27.948 --> 07:28.782
wouldn't it?

07:28.991 --> 07:30.158
Stop hating.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.368
Yeah, yeah.

07:31.577 --> 07:32.995
You wish you had a freak like that.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.290
Hey, uh, tommy, I got a favor to ask you.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.249
Yeah, I'm up.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.543
I'm going to be kinda making
the move on candy tonight.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.378
Oh, ok.
- Yeah, you know.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.005
So you want me to hang on to your cash

07:43.046 --> 07:44.423
and credit cards, is that the idea?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.299
He he!

07:46.383 --> 07:47.217
Listen, mikey wants me to

07:47.259 --> 07:48.844
work on them leaky pipes down at the bar.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.470
I'll do it tonight, I'll crash down there.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.346
Just do me a favor-

07:51.889 --> 07:52.806
once the sex is over,

07:52.848 --> 07:54.558
make sure she doesn't rifle through my bags.

07:54.766 --> 07:55.517
And also make sure

07:55.559 --> 07:57.561
she doesn't grab
a hold of the plasma,

07:57.603 --> 07:59.021
it's the only thing
in the apartment worth any value.

07:59.062 --> 07:59.938
Ok, you done now?

07:59.980 --> 08:00.814
Yeah, I'm done.

08:02.733 --> 08:03.901
What's up?

08:06.570 --> 08:08.197
Tell me that's not whatI think it is.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.199
Yeah.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.700
It's a kid.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.660
You all right?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.370
Ollie, I'm gonna need another bus

08:15.412 --> 08:16.830
and another engine company, all right?

08:16.872 --> 08:17.498
Hey, chief.

08:17.706 --> 08:18.373
What?

08:18.415 --> 08:19.500
What's that all about?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.752
Maybe lou found a box of donuts.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.253
He looks pretty upset.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.339
There's probably no bavarian cream.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.634
What's going on, lou? You all right?

08:28.967 --> 08:29.927
Yeah, what's up?

08:30.886 --> 08:31.762
You-

08:32.011 --> 08:33.639
oh, goddamn.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.057
Oh, shit!

08:39.311 --> 08:40.312
What's going on?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.773
Lou, what the-jesus christ.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.358
Mike, turn around.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.110
Trust me, this is not
something you want to witness.

08:47.611 --> 08:48.445
All right.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.197
I want everyone to take a deepbreath,

08:50.239 --> 08:51.657
and then we're all going to do our jobs

08:51.698 --> 08:52.908
and clean this shit up.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.119
We owe it whoever this kid's family is
to getthe bodies covered

08:56.161 --> 08:57.663
before those newspaper vultures show up

08:57.704 --> 08:58.914
and start taking pictures.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.625
Not to mention these rubberneckswith
the cell phone cameras.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.627
Franco, shawn, I want you to get-

09:03.669 --> 09:04.211
I got it, chief.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.296
Give me the blanket. I got it.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.173
Give me the blanket.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.029
All clear, lou?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.907
Holy shit. It was that bad?

10:57.199 --> 10:58.367
Worse?

10:58.659 --> 11:00.827
That was... jesus.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.663
Yeah, thank god for him.

11:03.789 --> 11:04.998
How does he do it, man?

11:05.999 --> 11:09.002
I guess when you see your only son run down

11:09.044 --> 11:10.504
and trampled like a rag doll...

11:11.797 --> 11:14.091
maybe it makes a mess
like this that much easier.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.388
Either that, or the rest of us are
just a bunch of giantpussies.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.059
I'm going with the rag doll thing.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.027
Open space in the forest,5 letters.

11:34.069 --> 11:34.778
Marsh.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.697
No, it needs to start with a "g," ma.

11:37.573 --> 11:38.407
Glade. -Glade.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.533
That's an air-freshener!

11:40.742 --> 11:42.953
I hate that you guys do
crossword puzzles, really.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.789
Tip of the iceberg, lace-wise.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.583
What the hell does that even mean?

11:47.708 --> 11:48.834
You know, if you guys get this right,

11:48.876 --> 11:50.043
I just want to drop dead right here.

11:50.085 --> 11:50.711
How many letters?

11:50.752 --> 11:51.670
5.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.713
I'm serious, ma.

11:53.172 --> 11:53.964
Aglet.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.009
A- g-I-e-T.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.094
Ok, somebody kill me, please. Right now.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.305
Jesus, sean, you look terrible.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.306
I'm maggie, by the way.

12:02.598 --> 12:03.828
Hey, nice to meet you.

12:03.863 --> 12:05.058
Yeah, I'm terrence.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.852
No wonder you two never stayed together.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.145
Way too smart for him.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.396
Oh, get serious, terrence.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.231
Your father was borderline retarded.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.942
He could barely even tie his own shoelaces.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.069
And we were together nearly 35 years.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.280
You are absolutely gorgeous, maggie.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.490
Those pictures sean sent me didn't lie.

12:20.532 --> 12:21.950
Ha, thanks, thanks.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.619
During our brief time together,

12:23.660 --> 12:26.663
sean almost never stopped
talking about you. Or you.

12:26.705 --> 12:27.706
Yeah. I'll bet.

12:28.081 --> 12:28.999
Terrence?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.000
Yeah, ma?

12:30.209 --> 12:31.084
Eyes.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.295
Oh. Sorry, ma. -It's ok.

12:33.337 --> 12:34.755
Hey, no, it's not ok. Knock it off.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.422
She said it was ok!

12:35.506 --> 12:37.424
Hey! Jesus.
- Come on.

12:37.925 --> 12:38.717
Sean...
- Ma!

12:38.759 --> 12:40.385
We're gonna go out, get some juice.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.678
Give you some time alone.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.387
Terrence, come on.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.139
Ma, I really don't think that's a good idea.

12:44.181 --> 12:44.932
You guys, really.

12:44.973 --> 12:45.557
I'm feeling a little-

12:46.725 --> 12:48.018
It was nice to meet you.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.605
You! Get out here.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.193
Ahem. So...

12:56.610 --> 12:57.694
Well, are you in pain?

12:57.986 --> 13:00.155
No. The drugs are good.

13:00.197 --> 13:00.989
Yeah.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.575
What, maggie?

13:03.617 --> 13:04.743
I came to make peace.

13:04.785 --> 13:05.869
You know, it's funny.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.205
Peace actually came
when the divorce went through.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.499
Yeah, well,
that's a pretty terrible thing to say.

13:10.541 --> 13:11.291
Well, it's true.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.168
Well, you want to deal
in the plain, hard facts?

13:13.210 --> 13:15.045
I came to make peace peace.
Everlasting peace.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.964
Yeah, everlasting peace.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.050
Did the doctors tell you

13:20.092 --> 13:21.468
what teddy said that they told you?

13:21.635 --> 13:22.094
I mean, is what my mom

13:22.135 --> 13:23.846
and terrence are telling me,
is that not true?

13:23.887 --> 13:24.638
Is that what you're saying?

13:24.680 --> 13:25.389
What, that you're gonna die?

13:25.597 --> 13:26.390
Oh, jesus.

13:26.932 --> 13:27.599
They told you that.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.642
Well, not in so many words,

13:28.677 --> 13:29.643
but I read between the lines.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.854
Look, sean, I don't deal in bullshit anymore.

13:31.895 --> 13:32.396
I'm clean.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.231
I'm sober, and I'm clear as a bell.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.400
And if this it, I just wanted you to know

13:36.567 --> 13:37.818
how much I loved you.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.738
And still love you. And hate you.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.783
And will love and hate you with equal measure

13:44.825 --> 13:45.909
as long as we both shall live.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.995
Like even if you die in
a half an hour from now.

13:48.036 --> 13:48.662
Ok, wait,

13:48.704 --> 13:50.414
is that what you read
into the doctor's conversation?

13:50.455 --> 13:51.206
Is that what you're saying?

13:51.248 --> 13:52.416
No, like I meant if the world comes to an end

13:52.457 --> 13:53.625
or something like that.

13:56.211 --> 13:56.879
Whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa,

13:56.920 --> 13:58.088
what are you doing, maggie? Hey!

13:58.130 --> 13:59.923
Well, I'm gonna make
love to you one last time.

13:59.965 --> 14:00.465
Maggie!

14:00.507 --> 14:01.258
What if this is it?

14:01.300 --> 14:03.427
First of all, you just
said that you hated me!

14:03.468 --> 14:04.636
No, I love-hate. Love-hate.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.262
Second of all,

14:05.304 --> 14:06.597
I don't want to.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.681
But this could be it!

14:08.015 --> 14:09.600
Would you please stop saying that?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.185
What if it is? -What if it isn't?

14:12.728 --> 14:14.354
Is that morphine?

14:14.396 --> 14:15.606
Yeah, that's morphine.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.024
Can I have a couple hits?

14:17.065 --> 14:17.983
Oh, my god. No, you can'T.

14:18.025 --> 14:18.901
I thought you just said that

14:18.942 --> 14:20.194
you were clean and sober, maggie.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.612
I am. I just wanted to level

14:21.653 --> 14:23.071
the playing field so that we're

14:23.113 --> 14:24.531
both on the same plain during sex.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.241
It's called sacrifice, sean.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.118
That was the whole problem with our marriage,

14:28.160 --> 14:29.453
no goddamn sacrifice.

14:29.495 --> 14:30.746
Just selfish one-way

14:30.787 --> 14:32.372
behavior the whole goddamn time.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.499
Yeah, you're right. By you!

14:33.540 --> 14:36.043
I know! My needs, my wants, my urges.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.836
I never once put any effort

14:37.878 --> 14:40.422
into trying to make this relationship work.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.841
Ok, you know, I think I'm dreaming.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.134
Could you slap me really quick -oh!

14:45.052 --> 14:48.430
Ho! Phew. Cool.

14:50.182 --> 14:53.310
Oh. Um, I'm sorry. Sean
- Oh, no, hey, dr. Lee.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.187
This is my wife-um, ex-wife maggie.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.355
Maggie, dr. Lee.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.523
Yes. We've met.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.816
I'll come back later.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.944
Ok, great. Thanks, doc.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.821
Do you want me to blow you?

15:18.001 --> 15:19.378
That shit today, man...

15:20.045 --> 15:20.921
it was gruesome.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.881
Top three on my all-time worst list.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.635
Where shit involving
kids, that was number one.

15:27.511 --> 15:28.345
Was he burned?

15:28.637 --> 15:30.639
She. Yeah.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.307
She was 8, maybe 10.

15:32.766 --> 15:33.725
It's tough to tell.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.978
How bad, exactly?

15:36.687 --> 15:37.896
You don't want to know, sweetheart.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.816
It's kind of a code we have for firemen.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.693
Stuff we see will stick with you, believe me,

15:42.734 --> 15:45.070
so we keep the ugliness to ourselves

15:45.779 --> 15:47.614
so ladies like you can go throughout your day

15:47.656 --> 15:49.825
without being haunted by it.

15:55.831 --> 15:56.832
Come on, pal.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.208
We're done for the day.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.003
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.380
How bad was that kid today, huh?

16:03.422 --> 16:04.173
What you saw?

16:05.674 --> 16:07.509
I don't really want to talk about it, carla.

16:07.551 --> 16:08.468
Well, I do.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.011
No, you don'T.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.762
Yeah, I do. She was burned?

16:11.680 --> 16:12.306
Yeah.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.348
To a crisp?

16:14.266 --> 16:15.726
Yes.

16:15.809 --> 16:16.685
What else?

16:16.727 --> 16:17.519
Jesus.

16:17.561 --> 16:18.353
Back off, numbnuts.

16:18.437 --> 16:22.649
What else?
Eyes were melted off, huh, nose off, what?

16:23.692 --> 16:24.109
God damn it, carla-

16:24.151 --> 16:24.651
Come on, asshole. Come on.

16:24.902 --> 16:25.736
Hey!

16:25.986 --> 16:26.570
Hey, look, you know,

16:26.612 --> 16:27.905
like he said, there's a code.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.198
Come on, asshole! Come on,

16:29.239 --> 16:30.490
pussylips, tell me!What else? Come on!

16:30.532 --> 16:31.700
Enough, god damn it!

16:32.784 --> 16:34.036
How'd that make you feel?

16:34.244 --> 16:35.204
Angry?

16:35.245 --> 16:36.288
Shit, yeah!

16:36.538 --> 16:37.289
Yeah? Pissed off?

16:37.331 --> 16:37.748
Yeah.

16:37.789 --> 16:38.832
Make you wonder where god was, huh?

16:39.291 --> 16:40.876
Why this child, why now, huh?

16:40.918 --> 16:42.085
Yes, god damn it, yes.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.253
Yeah, then use it!

16:43.712 --> 16:45.130
Hit that bag like you're hitting

16:45.172 --> 16:47.883
god or satan or whoever
the hell you want to blame.

16:47.925 --> 16:48.634
Right in the face, man.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.470
Take dead aim and hit that
bag with everything you got

16:51.512 --> 16:52.888
until it hurts not to hit it.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.056
Come on, hit it.

16:55.015 --> 16:55.766
Hit it!

17:08.403 --> 17:09.655
Hello?

17:10.531 --> 17:11.531
Ken?

17:11.615 --> 17:12.406
Yeah?

17:17.119 --> 17:18.329
I don't think I live here.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.249
Of course you do. Come in.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.646
I know, you cleaned up for me

17:22.682 --> 17:23.961
a little on my first night,

17:24.002 --> 17:25.712
so I cleaned up a lot.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.923
A lot a lot.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.425
Where the hell is everything?

17:31.218 --> 17:32.636
Well, the clothes are in the wash.

17:32.678 --> 17:35.264
Um, the furniture's just been touched up

17:35.305 --> 17:36.014
and rearranged a little bit.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.391
I polished up the coin collection.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.976
I sorted all the books, dvds

17:39.017 --> 17:41.436
and old records into alphabetical order.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.856
And I was just finishing
up cleaning out the fridge.

17:43.981 --> 17:45.691
I have a coin collection?

17:46.525 --> 17:49.194
It was on the couch under all the clothes?

17:49.236 --> 17:50.320
Looked pretty expensive,

17:50.404 --> 17:52.197
as did the civil war chess set.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.448
You play chess?

17:53.991 --> 17:54.908
I guess I used to.

17:56.994 --> 17:58.787
The place looks amazing, though.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.164
You did a great job.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.666
Let's celebrate, shall we?

18:03.208 --> 18:04.126
This looks nice.

18:04.168 --> 18:06.587
Tommy's gonna get a kick out of that.

18:06.628 --> 18:10.257
You know, he's a big fan of scented candles
and potpourri.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.594
He's not going to be
home tonight, by the way.

18:13.635 --> 18:18.140
We have the whole sparkling clean place
all to our itty, bitty selves.

18:35.449 --> 18:37.451
Yeah, boy.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.959
Yeah.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.439
Hey, candy.

19:07.606 --> 19:10.817
I've been doing a lot of thinking about-

19:12.319 --> 19:13.403
about a lot of things.

19:13.862 --> 19:14.571
Like?

19:15.322 --> 19:16.365
Like...

19:17.282 --> 19:23.121
like death and life and cake and donuts.

19:23.789 --> 19:26.333
And in between, you.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.335
A lot of you.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.754
More so than the cake

19:30.796 --> 19:34.132
and the donuts, which is a first for me.

19:36.802 --> 19:38.262
You know, I see...

19:40.138 --> 19:42.641
I see a lot of horrific things on the job.

19:42.683 --> 19:45.143
And seeing a dead kid
on the side of the road,

19:45.435 --> 19:46.436
it's never going to be easy.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.482
But sometimes, like today,

19:50.524 --> 19:51.650
it just hits you hard.

19:53.986 --> 19:55.028
Really hard.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.491
And on a day like that...

20:01.493 --> 20:05.080
the last thing you want to dois
go home to an empty house.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.375
And I think that if there's the slightest,

20:09.293 --> 20:16.049
outside long shot of a
chance for happiness here...

20:20.012 --> 20:22.514
look, I've been working a lot

20:22.556 --> 20:26.101
on the anger and resentment

20:26.143 --> 20:27.227
that I felt towards you

20:27.269 --> 20:30.105
and towards this whole situation.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.566
And I think...

20:33.942 --> 20:36.486
that I've made it to the next phase.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.114
Which is?

20:39.656 --> 20:40.657
Pizza.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.494
And forgiveness.

20:44.995 --> 20:45.621
'Cause I always thought that

20:45.662 --> 20:47.915
those two things went really well together.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.293
Just like, you know,

20:51.710 --> 20:54.379
champagne, and...

20:54.880 --> 20:56.548
and affection.

20:57.216 --> 20:59.134
Affection's good. -Affection's good.

21:00.469 --> 21:01.345
It is good.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.890
And, you know, my first impulse was to not-

21:04.932 --> 21:06.975
was to not make a move on you.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.019
Was to play things really cool

21:09.061 --> 21:10.979
and-and just to kind of feel you out

21:11.021 --> 21:12.940
and to see whether or not this time...

21:14.983 --> 21:16.026
it was for real or not,

21:16.068 --> 21:17.611
whether you were for real or not.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.696
And whether I thought about you-

21:19.947 --> 21:21.865
In between the cake and the donuts.

21:21.907 --> 21:22.950
Yeah, well, of course.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.035
The more I realized how...

21:28.038 --> 21:29.081
Is...

21:29.581 --> 21:32.501
how attracted I was to
you from the beginning.

21:40.801 --> 21:41.301
Ok.

21:42.261 --> 21:42.845
Ok.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.972
I feel the same way.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.182
I just-

21:47.891 --> 21:49.977
I want to take it slow.

21:50.435 --> 21:51.895
Ok.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.398
So, look, we'll have a
little bit of champagne a

21:54.439 --> 21:55.732
nd then we'll see where it goes.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.234
I actually quit drinking.

21:57.818 --> 21:58.735
Oh, yeah.

21:58.777 --> 21:59.695
I just...

22:01.280 --> 22:03.532
I think your first impulse was correct.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.701
My first impulse?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.327
What the hell was that?

22:07.369 --> 22:08.537
Take it slow, feel me out.

22:08.579 --> 22:09.580
Yeah, ok. Actually,

22:09.788 --> 22:11.206
my first impulse

22:11.707 --> 22:13.584
was to jump all over you, fast,

22:13.625 --> 22:15.127
and to feel you up, not to feel you out.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.670
My second impulse was a lot like the first,

22:16.712 --> 22:18.714
except there was a lot more jumping involved.

22:18.755 --> 22:21.466
My third impulse was to go kind of slow

22:21.508 --> 22:22.593
and to kind of feel you out.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.553
And you know,
just like women can have multiple orgasms,

22:24.595 --> 22:26.513
you know, men have multiple impulses.

22:26.555 --> 22:27.055
And I just happened to

22:27.097 --> 22:28.348
go with the wrong impulse at the time,

22:28.390 --> 22:30.184
so you really can't blame me
- Yeah, I can.

22:30.309 --> 22:31.226
Ok.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.271
I feel the same way you do.

22:34.313 --> 22:36.899
I just want to make sure
we do it right this time.

22:36.940 --> 22:37.691
Ok.

22:37.983 --> 22:40.777
So let's-let's just relax.
- Ok.

22:43.155 --> 22:44.865
Let things happen as they should.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.074
Ok.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.286
Ok?
- Mm-hmm.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.374
Want to play chess?

22:55.334 --> 22:56.001
Yeah.

22:56.502 --> 22:58.670
Can we do it in the nude?

24:36.643 --> 24:38.061
That week I got hit.

24:40.439 --> 24:41.815
On saturday, remember?

24:43.025 --> 24:45.652
It was going to be my
little league all star game.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.407
Mom making you take off work.

24:51.283 --> 24:52.159
You missed a bunch of my games,

24:52.201 --> 24:54.161
that summer you were
working all that overtime.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.207
It was going to be great.

25:01.335 --> 25:03.378
Look. It's uncle jimmy.

25:04.338 --> 25:06.089
He was always so funny.

25:07.799 --> 25:09.468
And damian.

25:11.845 --> 25:14.932
I think he's gonna make
such a good firefighter.

25:17.392 --> 25:18.519
I'd give anything to be there

25:18.560 --> 25:20.395
when he graduates from the academy.

25:24.858 --> 25:26.944
One thing I'm happy for was that

25:26.985 --> 25:29.029
my kid didn't die before me.

25:31.281 --> 25:32.658
Because if he did, that would

25:32.699 --> 25:34.034
just-that would be just...

25:34.743 --> 25:37.538
That would make my heart ache so much.

25:38.539 --> 25:39.623
I would never-

25:39.832 --> 25:42.125
never, ever be able to get over it.

25:42.376 --> 25:43.585
Me, either.

25:47.089 --> 25:49.383
You know, it's just a, um...

25:50.843 --> 25:52.344
it's like a silver lining on a

25:53.095 --> 25:54.930
never-ending dark cloud,

25:56.098 --> 25:57.224
hmm? You know, connor,

25:57.850 --> 25:58.892
when you died,

25:59.685 --> 26:01.395
it was just, um,

26:02.145 --> 26:03.522
it was so meaningless.

26:03.564 --> 26:06.775
You know, so... it was sounnecessary.

26:06.984 --> 26:08.610
I don't know, I just...

26:09.361 --> 26:11.613
you had your whole life laid out

26:11.655 --> 26:13.866
in front of you at your feet.

26:14.783 --> 26:15.993
Falling in love,

26:18.162 --> 26:19.788
having your own kids.

26:21.707 --> 26:23.542
I don't know how you deal with it, tommy.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.628
It must be killing you inside.

26:30.299 --> 26:32.467
Have another drink, bro.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.011
You're almost there.

26:35.012 --> 26:36.346
Just one more drink.

26:37.389 --> 26:38.849
One more and the-

26:39.183 --> 26:41.226
the dam is gonna burst, brother.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.561
I promise.

26:47.733 --> 26:50.319
You ain't gonna
make a difference.

26:51.904 --> 26:53.697
He can drink all the booze he wants.

26:53.989 --> 26:56.158
Drain the goddamn bar dry.

26:56.867 --> 26:57.826
It won't matter a bit.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.621
Ain't no tears inside them bottles.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.624
He already left behind those blue irish eyes.

27:04.541 --> 27:07.044
He cried them all, and carla got crushed.

27:07.669 --> 27:10.506
Same way I did when johnny here got clipped.

27:11.215 --> 27:12.341
I heard the news,

27:12.382 --> 27:14.384
went in the can and shed a few.

27:14.510 --> 27:17.763
Came right back out to face the music.

27:18.263 --> 27:20.766
Face the music, assholes.

27:21.558 --> 27:22.434
He's done.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.103
Dead as a doornail inside.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.939
Just like me.

27:27.731 --> 27:29.316
Only he's still walking around.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.277
That's why he's the best goddamn firefighter

27:32.319 --> 27:33.403
there ever will be.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.239
Better than I was.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.074
Better than jimmy was.

27:37.491 --> 27:41.203
Because the only thing he can feel is heat.

27:41.245 --> 27:42.579
Only thing that gets through

27:42.621 --> 27:45.999
that thick irish skin of his is fire.

27:46.708 --> 27:50.546
And even goddamn flames
ain't gonna make him cry.

27:51.213 --> 27:52.464
He's the real deal.

27:53.590 --> 27:55.008
Iron man,

27:55.592 --> 27:57.135
come to life.

28:37.426 --> 28:39.011
Oh, shit.

28:40.137 --> 28:41.180
Ow, shit!

28:45.100 --> 28:45.976
Shit.

30:14.106 --> 30:15.566
Oh, shit.

30:19.319 --> 30:21.029
God damn it.

30:31.123 --> 30:32.541
Oh, shit.

30:43.385 --> 30:44.344
Yeah?

30:44.386 --> 30:45.679
Hey, chief. What's up?

30:46.555 --> 30:48.223
You drinking? -Yeah, yeah.

30:48.390 --> 30:49.308
You drunk?

30:49.349 --> 30:53.979
Ah, well, I just got done
talking to my dead son,

30:54.021 --> 30:57.232
my dead brother, my cousin

30:57.441 --> 30:58.984
jimmy, who's also dead,

30:59.026 --> 31:00.527
and my dead father.

31:00.736 --> 31:02.196
So then I took a blowtorch

31:02.362 --> 31:05.199
and burned a hole in my leg

31:05.407 --> 31:07.618
big enough to stick my goddamn thumb into.

31:08.410 --> 31:09.036
What do you think?

31:09.077 --> 31:09.703
You think I'm drunk?

31:09.745 --> 31:11.872
All right. You don't have
to make fun of me, asshole.

31:11.997 --> 31:13.373
Jesus christ.

31:14.041 --> 31:15.584
Ahh, thanks for calling.

31:17.252 --> 31:18.170
Shit!

31:26.470 --> 31:27.179
Cutes.

31:27.429 --> 31:30.140
Hey. You still got that
first aid kit that I gave you,

31:30.182 --> 31:31.099
or did you lose it in the move?

31:31.141 --> 31:32.935
No, I got it.

31:33.018 --> 31:35.145
I just unpackedit yesterday, actually. Why?

31:35.187 --> 31:38.315
All right. I'll be right over. Shit.

31:45.072 --> 31:45.864
Oh, I know, I know,

31:45.906 --> 31:46.698
it hurts, it hurts!

31:46.740 --> 31:47.741
I know. More.

31:47.783 --> 31:48.951
But it's gonna hurt worse!

31:48.992 --> 31:50.160
No, no, no, put more in there.

31:50.202 --> 31:50.869
Just clean it out.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.375
Oh! Oh, my god, I can't do this.

31:56.416 --> 31:57.626
I can't do this. It looks too painful.

31:57.668 --> 31:59.086
Please let me take you to the emergency room.

31:59.127 --> 31:59.962
I'm not going to the emergency room!

32:02.172 --> 32:02.756
Shit.

32:03.215 --> 32:04.216
Oh, god, tommy.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.845
Tommy, this is very sick.

32:08.095 --> 32:10.138
I'm sorry. You know, sometimes

32:10.180 --> 32:12.182
I bottle up my emotions about

32:12.224 --> 32:14.393
jimmy and I will go for months and months

32:14.560 --> 32:16.478
without shedding a tear,

32:16.520 --> 32:20.607
but I would never, ever get into S.I.B.

32:20.816 --> 32:21.608
What?

32:22.901 --> 32:24.820
Self injurious behavior.

32:24.862 --> 32:26.989
It's a thing. I saw it on intervention.

32:27.281 --> 32:28.740
Jesus christ. -That's a good show!

32:28.782 --> 32:29.908
And it's called cutting.

32:30.868 --> 32:32.390
I know what it's called.

32:32.425 --> 32:33.912
Besides which, you know,

32:34.663 --> 32:37.916
the sex thing between us has been so great,

32:38.250 --> 32:39.418
and now...

32:40.085 --> 32:41.253
you're not going to be able to

32:41.295 --> 32:43.172
have sex with me for
such a long time because-

32:43.714 --> 32:45.549
god damn it!

32:45.591 --> 32:46.925
Where that thing is,

32:47.718 --> 32:50.220
it's just gonna kill.

32:50.429 --> 32:54.349
It will just keep opening up over and over

32:54.558 --> 32:55.309
and just be this big,

32:56.018 --> 32:58.937
pus-y wound that would never heal.

32:59.188 --> 32:59.688
Like, ugh.

32:59.730 --> 33:01.773
If you try to make love to me with that cut,

33:01.940 --> 33:04.526
I don't care how strong you are,

33:04.568 --> 33:07.112
it would be like absolute torture.

33:11.033 --> 33:12.242
Yeah.

33:14.453 --> 33:16.413
Take your clothes off. Ahh.

33:17.498 --> 33:18.373
What did you say?

33:18.499 --> 33:19.500
Take your clothes off.

33:19.541 --> 33:20.501
What? No, that's weird.

33:20.542 --> 33:21.293
Yeah, come here.

33:21.418 --> 33:23.128
No, I don't think that
this is the right time-

33:23.170 --> 33:24.338
Take off your top. Come here.

33:24.546 --> 33:25.214
Come on.

33:25.297 --> 33:26.590
I'll take my own shirt off.

33:26.632 --> 33:27.341
Hurry up.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.092
Take off your pants.

33:29.593 --> 33:30.344
Hurry up!

33:32.596 --> 33:33.972
Yeah. Ok.

33:34.556 --> 33:34.973
Yeah.

33:36.517 --> 33:37.601
Yeah. Turn around.

33:37.643 --> 33:41.188
No! No, I don't want to
touch it! Ohh! Ahh! Oh.

33:42.564 --> 33:43.106
Ok?

33:43.148 --> 33:45.609
Ah. Ooh. I don't-it's going to be-

33:45.651 --> 33:46.568
it's going to hurt you!

33:46.693 --> 33:49.112
Listen to me. Ok?

33:54.493 --> 33:55.327
How's that?

33:55.369 --> 33:57.329
It's tempting-I don't
wantto go harder, though.

33:57.371 --> 33:58.247
Yeah, come on, move a little harder.

33:58.288 --> 33:59.957
No, no
- ahh!

33:59.998 --> 34:02.000
Come on. That's good.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.335
Good girl. Come on.

34:03.794 --> 34:05.003
Come on.

34:06.338 --> 34:09.466
Up and down. Harder. Grind.

34:09.507 --> 34:10.551
I'm not gonna go harder than that.

34:11.342 --> 34:11.760
Come on.

34:54.887 --> 34:56.388
Oh, jesus.

34:56.429 --> 34:57.306
Oh, my god, are you ok?

34:58.724 --> 34:59.308
No.

35:00.017 --> 35:01.727
Can I do anything?

35:01.810 --> 35:02.477
Yeah.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.441
12 advils and a sandwich.

35:10.652 --> 35:11.987
I'm not kidding.

35:12.029 --> 35:12.696
Oh. Ok.

35:12.988 --> 35:13.822
All right.

35:14.990 --> 35:18.494
And grab me a bottle of whisky.

35:21.413 --> 35:22.331
All right?

35:27.544 --> 35:29.546
A shrill, chirping sound.

35:33.217 --> 35:34.051
Chirk.

35:34.801 --> 35:37.429
C- h-I-r-K.

35:39.431 --> 35:41.225
Want me to go see if sean and ma are awake?

35:43.101 --> 35:44.186
I take that as a yes.

35:45.979 --> 35:48.440
Guys, I hope sean looks
better when he wakes up.

35:48.482 --> 35:50.192
Yeah, he looked like death warmed over.

35:50.359 --> 35:50.734
Yeah.

35:50.776 --> 35:52.361
Ok, kids, let's stay together.

35:52.861 --> 35:53.695
Just follow me.

35:54.404 --> 35:56.490
This way.

36:04.748 --> 36:06.291
The cancer kids.

36:15.259 --> 36:17.970
Kid on my
block's got the same thing.

36:27.688 --> 36:29.481
Is the blue one you like?

36:40.993 --> 36:42.870
You know, a lot of these kids won't make it.

36:53.297 --> 36:54.381
Want to go back to your room?

36:54.590 --> 36:55.299
That's it.

37:12.983 --> 37:13.984
Both asleep still.

37:15.903 --> 37:17.237
What's up?

37:17.279 --> 37:19.281
The hot nurse come by again?

37:19.615 --> 37:20.699
Oh, shit.

37:20.741 --> 37:22.618
See, last night, sean wasn't looking so good,

37:22.659 --> 37:23.619
I faked a few sobs.

37:23.869 --> 37:25.954
She brought me an orange and a snickers bar.

37:27.581 --> 37:29.041
She even bent over, hand it to me.

37:29.082 --> 37:30.375
I swear I saw her nipples.

37:34.213 --> 37:35.839
Please don't stand here looking sad.

37:36.507 --> 37:37.883
It only stands to remind the children

37:37.925 --> 37:39.092
just how sick they are.

37:39.384 --> 37:40.594
If you want to come in,

37:40.886 --> 37:43.263
you have to literally put on a happy face.

37:43.388 --> 37:44.973
Otherwise, I'm sorry,

37:45.015 --> 37:47.434
but I'm going to have to ask
you to move awayfrom the window.

37:47.476 --> 37:48.143
Gotcha.

38:05.994 --> 38:08.539
Start spreading the news,

38:09.456 --> 38:11.708
I'm leaving today,

38:13.252 --> 38:16.547
I want to be a part of it,

38:18.674 --> 38:21.051
new york, new york,

38:26.014 --> 38:29.017
these vagabond shoes

38:29.518 --> 38:31.311
are longing to stray

38:33.730 --> 38:36.358
right through the very heart of it,

38:38.318 --> 38:41.071
new york, new york,

38:46.869 --> 38:50.038
I wanna wake up in a city

38:50.080 --> 38:51.165
that doesn't sleep,

38:53.167 --> 38:54.668
to find I'm cream of the crop

38:55.002 --> 38:59.590
top of the heap,

39:01.717 --> 39:05.053
these little town blues

39:06.054 --> 39:08.307
are melting away,

39:09.474 --> 39:13.687
I'll make a brand-new start of it,

39:14.897 --> 39:17.149
oh, in old new york,

39:19.026 --> 39:22.112
if I can make it there

39:22.529 --> 39:24.656
I'll make it anywhere,

39:25.949 --> 39:27.868
new york,

39:31.997 --> 39:35.542
it's up to you,

39:36.168 --> 39:42.174
new york

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
