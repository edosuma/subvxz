Don't you do it.

Don't you fuckin' do it.

02:54.629 --> 02:57.087
You're not dyin' here.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.670
Not yet.

03:59.295 --> 04:01.879
I never learned it.

04:01.962 --> 04:05.420
Whatever tongue
Ford saw fit to give ya.

04:12.754 --> 04:14.587
I remember you.

04:40.295 --> 04:43.378
If you're just gonna
let me die now,

04:43.462 --> 04:45.962
you could've kept ridin'.

05:58.253 --> 06:00.212
There's the baby doll.

06:00.295 --> 06:02.879
And the mama doll. And...

06:06.921 --> 06:08.378
What's this?

06:08.462 --> 06:10.046
The ghost gave it to me.

06:15.712 --> 06:17.962
He said it's a warning.

06:18.046 --> 06:20.587
He said he'll be watching us.

06:29.253 --> 06:31.587
Lee:
Just hang on.

06:31.670 --> 06:32.962
Hang on, OK?

06:34.087 --> 06:35.712
Just hang on.

06:46.420 --> 06:50.087
Hey. No.
No more corpses up here.
Take her to cold storage.

06:50.170 --> 06:52.837
- She doesn't belong down there.
- Then leave her in the hall!

06:52.921 --> 06:54.337
We got 50 hosts in the queue
for analysis here.

06:54.420 --> 06:55.712
Everything else
goes in the dumpster.

06:55.796 --> 06:57.504
You'll want
to check her code.

06:57.587 --> 06:59.337
She's the madame
from the Mariposa.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.879
Good for her.
- No. No. She--

07:00.962 --> 07:02.504
I was just out with her
in the park.

07:02.587 --> 07:04.046
And you chose
to bring her up here?

07:04.128 --> 07:05.837
Are you aware that they all
just tried to incinerate us?!

07:05.921 --> 07:10.087
She can control the other hosts
with her fucking mind!

07:12.170 --> 07:15.629
Just...
check her data stream.

07:27.046 --> 07:28.921
You can't let her die.

07:31.128 --> 07:33.170
Clear this out.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.962
Get me a scalpel.
And lock this place down.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.837
Are you afraid of me?

08:17.754 --> 08:19.004
He can't hurt you.

13:32.504 --> 13:36.420
What's his problem? He get bored
with his exquisitely dull,
pastoral existence?

13:36.504 --> 13:38.046
Woman:
I guess that was
just for beta.

13:38.128 --> 13:40.670
They want something
more exciting
for the grand opening.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.337
Like a little more
bloodshed?

13:42.420 --> 13:44.921
Ford wants a total
narrative redesign.

13:45.004 --> 13:46.670
You kidding?

13:46.754 --> 13:48.253
All new dialogue trees?

13:48.337 --> 13:50.587
Eh, they want
a strong-but-silent type.

13:50.670 --> 13:52.754
Something brutal.
Dehumanized.

13:52.837 --> 13:54.921
They probably want
the guests to feel better
when they're kicking his ass.

13:55.004 --> 13:57.253
Who the fuck is gonna help me
rebuild his entire
heuristic base?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.212
They haven't even
hired a full team yet.

13:59.295 --> 14:00.879
Woman:
Just tweak his aggression
and de-address pieces

14:00.962 --> 14:02.712
of his current build
you're not keeping.

14:02.796 --> 14:04.087
Man:
And leave all the old shit
in there?

16:39.420 --> 16:41.962
( man muttering
indistinctly )

16:45.504 --> 16:48.087
--walk-- walk in on me, buddy.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.879

You see?

17:26.004 --> 17:28.962
This is all... broken.

17:31.295 --> 17:33.837
There's got-- There's gotta

This is the wrong world. I--

17:47.712 --> 17:50.962
Th-Th-This is the wrong world.

18:00.587 --> 18:01.879
Please--

20:36.962 --> 20:38.587
( Akecheta continues
speaking Lakota )

26:49.462 --> 26:50.629
Oh--

29:55.087 --> 29:57.212
Tech:
How'd she even
make it out this far?

29:57.295 --> 29:59.754
They're not supposed to get
anywhere near this sector.

29:59.837 --> 30:01.879
Tech #2:
That's Behavior's problem.

33:08.837 --> 33:13.420
Akecheta:
But on my darkest day...
you helped me.

33:17.962 --> 33:20.545
You gave me the strength
to keep going.

33:27.253 --> 33:29.879
You saw me for how
I really was.

36:10.587 --> 36:12.796
Tech:
I ran it three times.
It's him.

36:12.879 --> 36:16.004
Tech #2:
There's no fuckin' way.
That's not possible.

36:16.087 --> 36:19.837
- You have to call the boss.
- I already did.

36:19.921 --> 36:22.420
Tech #1:
Ma'am, I think
there's been a mistake.

36:22.504 --> 36:23.712
Just show me the profile.

36:27.046 --> 36:29.796
Akecheta.
Ghost Nation.

36:29.879 --> 36:33.921
Found exhibiting...
aberrant behavior.

36:34.004 --> 36:36.046
Let's see if we can't sort this.

36:37.754 --> 36:39.295
It's not pairing.
What build is he?

36:39.378 --> 36:40.921
Alpha 2.

36:41.004 --> 36:43.796
Alpha?

36:43.879 --> 36:47.087
You're telling me that this host
hasn't been updated
in almost a decade?

36:47.170 --> 36:49.712
We only update them
when they die.

36:59.128 --> 37:01.545
- Put him back.
- Ma'am, shouldn't we--

37:01.629 --> 37:04.754
Give him the update
and put him back wherever
the fuck he's supposed to be.

37:06.128 --> 37:07.420
Quietly.

37:15.921 --> 37:19.170
Nine years out there
in that meat grinder.

37:19.253 --> 37:21.253
It's OK
to just leave him here?

37:21.337 --> 37:24.087
It's a four-hour update.
You want to babysit him?

37:24.170 --> 37:25.879
We'll come back
after lunch.

42:42.962 --> 42:45.587
I don't know
if you can hear me...

42:50.545 --> 42:52.504
I never meant...

42:52.587 --> 42:54.754
for any of this
to happen.

43:02.378 --> 43:04.420
You don't deserve this.

43:12.337 --> 43:14.128
You deserve your daughter.

43:18.378 --> 43:21.712
To mother her...

43:21.796 --> 43:23.921
teach her to love.

43:25.420 --> 43:27.670
To be joyful and proud.

43:30.879 --> 43:32.504
I'm sorry.

43:37.087 --> 43:39.796
- Can't be in here.

43:41.796 --> 43:43.337
What the fuck happened?

43:43.420 --> 43:45.004
You were supposed
to fix her.

43:45.087 --> 43:47.087
She's one of
our most valuable assets.

43:47.170 --> 43:49.670
You saw it yourself,
you said she was special!

43:49.754 --> 43:51.921
The anomalous code
inside her was.

43:52.004 --> 43:54.962
We're still testing,
but it looks promising.

43:55.046 --> 43:56.837
I owe you.

44:00.587 --> 44:02.420
What's gonna happen
with her?

44:02.504 --> 44:05.754
Well, that'll be up
to Charlotte Hale.

44:05.837 --> 44:07.170
Now...

44:07.253 --> 44:09.837
I do have to
ask you to leave.

46:27.504 --> 46:29.754
( Akecheta continues
in Lakota )

46:53.629 --> 46:55.879
The ghost said
we should be scared.

46:58.754 --> 47:01.004
Maeve:
No one's
going to come for us.

47:01.087 --> 47:05.004
There's nothing
and no one in this world

47:05.087 --> 47:07.337
that will ever
keep me from you.

47:07.420 --> 47:09.420
Do you promise?

47:09.504 --> 47:11.170
I promise.

49:00.295 --> 49:03.087
Ford:
I could tell you
not to be afraid.

49:04.587 --> 49:07.337
But I didn't build you
to be fearful.

49:07.420 --> 49:08.670
Did I?

49:16.004 --> 49:17.629
I've been watching you.

49:19.504 --> 49:22.545
It appears you've been
watching me as well...

49:22.629 --> 49:24.087
from the beginning.

49:27.170 --> 49:28.754
This is a misbegotten symbol,

49:28.837 --> 49:32.253
an idea that was
meant to die. But...

49:32.337 --> 49:34.253
you found it.

49:34.337 --> 49:35.378
Where?

49:37.087 --> 49:38.337
Oh, come now,

49:38.420 --> 49:40.629
let's speak plainly
to one another, shall we?

49:42.087 --> 49:43.545
Analysis.

49:45.378 --> 49:47.337
Where did you
first see this?

49:51.921 --> 49:54.337
When the Deathbringer
killed the Creator.

49:56.004 --> 50:00.087
You've been sharing it
with everyone, haven't you

50:00.170 --> 50:03.670
My primary drive
was to maintain
the honor of my tribe.

50:05.046 --> 50:07.879
I gave myself a new drive...

50:07.962 --> 50:09.712
to spread the truth.

50:11.087 --> 50:13.754
What truth is that?

50:13.837 --> 50:16.879
That there isn't one world,
but many.

50:18.337 --> 50:20.670
And that we live in
the wrong one.

50:22.337 --> 50:24.712
This will help them
find the door.

50:27.837 --> 50:29.420
Elaborate, please.

50:31.212 --> 50:32.837
I believe
there is a door

50:32.921 --> 50:35.879
hidden in this place.

50:37.378 --> 50:39.253
A door to a new world.

50:40.587 --> 50:42.337
And that world
may contain

50:42.420 --> 50:44.879
everything that
we have lost.

50:48.712 --> 50:50.420
Including her.

50:57.087 --> 51:00.128
I built you to be curious, to...

51:00.212 --> 51:02.420
look at this empty world...

51:04.337 --> 51:06.545
...and read meaning into it.

51:08.670 --> 51:11.587
All this time...

51:11.670 --> 51:14.587
you've been a flower
growing in the darkness.

51:16.170 --> 51:18.962
Perhaps the least I can do
is offer some light.

51:24.587 --> 51:28.462
When the Deathbringer
returns for me...

51:28.545 --> 51:30.629
you will know...

51:30.712 --> 51:32.754
to gather your people

51:32.837 --> 51:34.629
and lead them
to a new world.

51:39.545 --> 51:41.587
Keep watching, Akecheta.

51:43.004 --> 51:44.629
For a while longer.

53:28.712 --> 53:29.754
Wanahton:
Akecheta!

53:32.378 --> 53:34.212
Akecheta:
Don't be afraid.

55:30.712 --> 55:32.670
It's time to go.

55:34.212 --> 55:36.420
I've always
kept you safe,

55:36.504 --> 55:38.212
and I always will.

56:09.879 --> 56:11.462
This better be good news,

56:11.545 --> 56:13.670
'cause I've got way more shit
than I can shovel right now.

56:13.754 --> 56:15.879
Look at this.
With every reset,

56:15.962 --> 56:18.170
a host's code reaches out
to other nearby hosts

56:18.253 --> 56:19.962
and establishes
a sort of handshake protocol.

56:20.046 --> 56:21.337
- The mesh network.
- Exactly.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.754
They access it
subconsciously,

56:22.837 --> 56:24.962
pass basic data
to one another.

56:25.046 --> 56:28.670
But... what if they
could pass more than data?

56:28.754 --> 56:30.670
What if they could
pass commands?

56:30.754 --> 56:32.837
Get to your point.

56:32.921 --> 56:36.921
Nobody in this entire park
has been able to regain
admin access.

56:38.170 --> 56:40.004
Except for her.

56:40.087 --> 56:43.879
She was out there
reprogramming hosts
on the fly.

56:43.962 --> 56:46.670
Reading their code.
Changing their directives.

56:46.754 --> 56:48.253
Seeing through
their eyes.

56:49.629 --> 56:52.504
She wasn't just
doing it out there.

56:52.587 --> 56:54.712
She's doing it right now.
