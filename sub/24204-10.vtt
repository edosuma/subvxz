00:06.500 --> 00:08.240
My sister is back?

00:08.250 --> 00:10.878
Yeah.
She's with two others.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.950
[Donna]
Where is Ryn?

00:12.960 --> 00:15.030
They want me
back in the water.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.611
These things,
they attacked us.

00:17.620 --> 00:19.110
I know how you must feel,

00:19.120 --> 00:20.826
but going after him,
it's not gonna be good.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.877
-Xander?
-I'm worried about him.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.869
Xander, wait!

00:25.880 --> 00:27.199
Stay where you are, Ben!

00:29.330 --> 00:30.319
Stop!

00:30.330 --> 00:32.286
[Ryn screams]

00:32.290 --> 00:33.200
How is she?

00:33.210 --> 00:35.246
She's getting worse.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.242
Ryn, there is someone
who might be able to help.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.740
Someone who has
your Sister's blood.

00:39.750 --> 00:43.163
-I can make the call.
-Okay.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.614
Dr. Decker, it's Ben.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.668
We need you.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.280
Donna,
please don't go.

00:55.290 --> 00:56.700
Stay with me.

00:56.710 --> 00:58.200
Okay? I am here.

00:58.210 --> 00:59.370
[knock on door]

01:01.710 --> 01:04.918
Ah. She's in there.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.036
I've cleaned the wound,
dressed it.

01:10.210 --> 01:11.996
[wheezing]

01:13.040 --> 01:14.917
Hey, come on.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.410
Uh, I'm good.

01:18.960 --> 01:19.995
Can you set up a drip?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.240
Yeah.

01:22.420 --> 01:24.741
Here. Take this
and hang it up there.

01:26.330 --> 01:27.991
What is it,
the machines?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.240
It's to check
how she's doing.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.491
Her heart rate,
her blood pressure.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.706
It'll help her.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.575
These are the cells
that we extracted from you.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.320
They could help you.

01:44.330 --> 01:47.208
No. Please.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.325
No. No.

01:48.330 --> 01:49.820
He's here to help you.

01:49.830 --> 01:51.161
Look at me.

01:51.170 --> 01:53.206
I am here

[knock on door]

02:08.080 --> 02:09.206
Hi, Maddie.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.245
Hi.

02:13.210 --> 02:14.666
[Ben] She's weak,

02:14.670 --> 02:16.206
but her heart rate's
Increased.

02:16.210 --> 02:18.576
Blood pressure's
stabilizing as well.

02:18.580 --> 02:20.207
You called him?

02:20.210 --> 02:22.872
She was dying, Maddie.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.996
We didn't have a choice.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.456
He helped her.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.745
How's your father?

02:36.750 --> 02:38.286
He's okay.

02:38.290 --> 02:39.575
He got luclq.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.741
Maddie, they were
gonna kill them.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.456
We had to do something.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.202
We don't need to talk
about this right now.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.246
Ben tried to help us.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.325
I know, Ryn.

02:54.330 --> 02:56.161
But he didn't, did he?

03:01.380 --> 03:04.201
[placid high-pitched calls]

03:05.620 --> 03:08.282
[Vaults' "Cry No More" playing]

03:13.380 --> 03:16.918
A poison word
that you chose

03:16.920 --> 03:18.660
[siren]

03:18.670 --> 03:24.700
And the distance grows

03:29.170 --> 03:32.412
And I don't
want to cry no more

03:36.170 --> 03:39.492
And I don't want to die
a little more

03:39.500 --> 03:41.286
Every day

03:43.120 --> 03:46.248
And I don't
want to cry no more

03:49.210 --> 03:52.373
You gotta be kidding.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.245
How many?

03:54.250 --> 03:55.535
All right,
I'll ask around
and get back to you.

03:55.540 --> 03:56.871
What's going on?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.450
Shots fired
in town last night.

03:58.460 --> 03:59.745
Shots? What happened?

03:59.750 --> 04:02.241
No idea.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.036
I was nearly caught
in the middle of it.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.166
What?!

04:05.170 --> 04:06.740
I was out on a date.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.991
Dale Bishop showed up
holding a shotgun,

04:09.000 --> 04:10.490
told us to get
back inside.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.536
What is going on
around here?

04:12.540 --> 04:14.326
I better stop in
on Dale,

04:14.330 --> 04:15.456
see what I can find out.

04:15.460 --> 04:16.529
Maybe you better.

04:29.380 --> 04:33.168
I don't get why
you're blaming me
for all this.

04:33.170 --> 04:35.206
All right? I did it
to protect Ryn.

04:35.210 --> 04:36.370
What's going on?

04:36.380 --> 04:38.029
Really?

04:38.040 --> 04:41.749
I look at you
and the choices you're making,

04:41.750 --> 04:43.706
the way you're
talking about Ryn,

04:43.710 --> 04:45.450
and I feel like you're
a different person.

04:45.460 --> 04:47.530
Maddie, stop.

04:47.540 --> 04:48.916
Even bringing Decker in.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.569
He's helping her.

04:50.580 --> 04:51.786
He's dangerous.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.997
We used to make
decisions together.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.412
I feel like you're
off in your own head.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.377
May I

05:05.380 --> 05:06.779
ask her a question?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.450
Yes.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.416
You...

05:16.420 --> 05:19.116
sang a song before to me.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.202
Could you do it again?

05:21.210 --> 05:22.950
Your voice is so beautiful.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.246
You need to leave.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.956
I just need
to hear it once--

05:27.960 --> 05:30.451
She sang to you
to escape from you,

05:30.460 --> 05:32.200
not because she loves you.

05:32.210 --> 05:33.370
But...

05:35.500 --> 05:37.206
She will not do it again.

05:46.790 --> 05:50.248
[Siren song echoing]

05:53.380 --> 05:54.824
Will you sing to me?

How is she?

06:03.620 --> 06:05.702

06:05.710 --> 06:08.076
You don't seem happy
about it.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.742
The sister, Ryn,

06:10.750 --> 06:12.911
what's between you two?

06:13.960 --> 06:15.450
What do you mean?

06:15.460 --> 06:19.533
Ryn said her sister
doesn't love me.

06:19.540 --> 06:20.529
Why would she sing?

06:20.540 --> 06:23.031
Why would she
draw me to her?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.240
I don't know anymore
about it than you do.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.409
You seem to.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.708
I just need it one more time.

06:32.710 --> 06:34.325
I saved her life.

06:34.330 --> 06:36.537
Maybe you can talk
to her for me.

06:36.540 --> 06:39.577
I don't hear it again,

06:39.580 --> 06:41.286

my damn mind.

06:49.460 --> 06:52.418

Please take me back.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.109
To the water.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.826
She's not strong enough.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.410
Not yet.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.320
Please.

07:03.330 --> 07:07.073
I'll leave you two
alone to talk.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.661
We must wait.

07:08.670 --> 07:12.413
It takes a lot
of strength to change.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.535
[groans]

07:16.580 --> 07:20.459
I will take you
when you're better.

07:25.540 --> 07:28.577
Remember when we were young?

07:28.580 --> 07:31.378
We hunted together

07:31.380 --> 07:32.665
for days.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.992
I chased you
to make you fast.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.373
And you taught me
how to fight

07:42.540 --> 07:44.576
and be strong.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.320
You are strong.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.575
And good.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.741
[Dale]
What you did last night,

08:00.750 --> 08:03.207
discharging your weapon,
was way out of line.

08:03.210 --> 08:05.531
Next time I tell you
to go home and cool off,

08:05.540 --> 08:07.781
you do it.

08:07.790 --> 08:08.870
I hear you, sir.

without thinking,

back to you, Xander.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.451
You don't want that
In your life

08:21.460 --> 08:23.530
or near your mom.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.667
Thanks, but--

08:27.670 --> 08:29.570
But what?

08:29.580 --> 08:31.787
What's the plan?

08:31.790 --> 08:33.781
You know, to keep
this thing under control?

08:35.580 --> 08:38.413
Don't you think you
have enough to worry
about right now?

08:38.420 --> 08:39.660
Yeah, I do, but I just--

08:39.670 --> 08:41.206
Go home, Xander.

08:41.210 --> 08:43.826
Start your dad's business
up again.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.536
Let me worry
about the rest.

08:48.170 --> 08:49.239
You his ride?

08:49.250 --> 08:51.411
Yeah, I got him.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.614
All right.

08:56.290 --> 08:58.667

Hey, so what the hell
happened last night, man?

09:08.790 --> 09:10.326
He was here,

09:10.330 --> 09:11.740
the one that killed
my dad.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.320
I went after his ass.

09:13.330 --> 09:14.661
Dude, why the hell
didn't you call me?

09:14.670 --> 09:15.910
Did you get him?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.820
Some shit went down,

09:17.830 --> 09:19.411
but he's gone now.

09:19.420 --> 09:21.661
I gotta let it go, man.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.877
Do what my dad
would want me to do.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.825
I'm the captain now.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.240
Yeah.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.741
Yeah, for sure.

Despite all this craziness
that's been goin' on,

we've been making
some pretty good coin
these last couple months.

But, look,
I already blew it all.

Yeah? On what?

09:39.040 --> 09:41.452
It wasn't a wardrobe,
that's for damn sure.

kind of serious, huh?

09:49.670 --> 09:51.820
Hey, uh, what
would you think if I,

09:51.830 --> 09:53.786
I don't know,
asked her to move in?

09:53.790 --> 09:56.281
-What, with us?
-Yeah.

09:56.290 --> 09:57.700

of crowded and all that.

No, it's not that.

09:58.710 --> 10:00.109

always get along, but--

10:01.670 --> 10:03.615
I just rub her
the wrong way, man.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.032
Maybe you guys can
get your own place?

10:06.040 --> 10:09.112
No way, man. I wouldn't
feel right leaving you
by yourself right now.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.872
I'll be fine, man,
seriously.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.279
No, seriously, look,
it's not gonna happen, okay?

10:12.290 --> 10:13.917
So just forget it.

then she woke up.

were helping?

They were taken from her
in aquatic form.

10:51.330 --> 10:53.878
Must be causing some kind
of adverse reaction.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.916
She may have an infection.

[Ted] You sure you're okay?

14:11.580 --> 14:13.070
Doc didn't think you
needed a day or two?

14:13.080 --> 14:14.877
Lot goin' on in town.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.950
Yeah. I heard
there were shots fired.

14:16.960 --> 14:17.995
What happened?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.991
We had
a drunk and disorderly.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.286
Had to bring in
Xander McClure.

14:22.290 --> 14:23.746
Let him sleep it off.

14:23.750 --> 14:24.956
I guess we shouldn't
be too surprised

14:24.960 --> 14:26.996
considering
what he's going through.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.321
[Dale]
Well, I didn't charge him.

14:29.330 --> 14:30.957
Just let him
blow off some steam.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.167
But it won't happen again.
Got my eye on him.

14:33.170 --> 14:34.535
Well, that's good.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.076
What about the rest of it?

14:37.500 --> 14:38.990
The rest of what?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.786
Donnie Price's murder,
two break-ins at my warehouse,

14:40.790 --> 14:42.781
one of my guys attacked.

14:42.790 --> 14:47.113
We got a opioid
epidemic on our hands
in this country, Ted.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.452
Crime is up in every county
in the state.

14:49.460 --> 14:52.452
Whatever happened
to the nice little town
we grew up In, huh?

14:52.460 --> 14:55.076
Look, I'm gonna be
straight with you, Dale.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.456
Town council's making noise.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.109
Crime scares tourists away.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.997
Lot of people in this town
depend on that.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.536
Mermaid capital
of the world.

15:01.540 --> 15:02.825
That's right.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.570
They want answers.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.208
They're meeting later today.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.370
Maybe, uh...

15:08.380 --> 15:10.666
Maybe you show up,
put 'em at ease.

15:10.670 --> 15:11.989
Sure, Ted.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.376
Be happy to.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.495
[Ted]
That'd be great, Dale.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.910
3:00 at the lodge.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.377
Take care of that leg.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.449
Will do.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.616
Are you sure you know
where we're goin'?

15:28.620 --> 15:31.168
Like the back
of my own hand.

15:31.170 --> 15:33.991
[Helen] Okay,
be careful up here.

15:53.830 --> 15:56.037
[Ben]
What is this place?

15:57.540 --> 15:59.826
This is my family's
burial ground.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.319
I'm sorry.

16:02.330 --> 16:03.740
I know this is...

16:03.750 --> 16:06.241
Sacred, yes.

16:06.250 --> 16:09.117
But it is for human.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.829
My sister would not want
to lay with humans.

16:12.830 --> 16:14.912
They're not human, Ryn.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.496
These are the ones
_that were killed
In the massacre.

16:20.500 --> 16:24.459
No. The story you read
in the book,

16:24.460 --> 16:27.167
those creatures
were slaughtered
out on the water.

16:27.170 --> 16:30.116
But others,
in human form,

16:30.120 --> 16:32.873
died in Bristol Cove.

16:34.330 --> 16:38.164
She was the first.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.700
She was the daughter

16:41.710 --> 16:44.998
of Charles Pownall
and his mermaid.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.956
The baby is buried here?

16:48.960 --> 16:52.873
Ryn told me that Charles
killed his child.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.950
Oh, no.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.451
That may be
what your colony believes,

16:57.460 --> 17:00.111
but that's not what happened.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.419
The baby was born
in transition

17:03.420 --> 17:05.741
and appeared deformed,

17:05.750 --> 17:08.571
a soul caught
between two worlds.

17:08.580 --> 17:11.378
Charles knew
that the doctors
of Bristol Cove

17:11.380 --> 17:13.826
would see her
as an abomination

17:13.830 --> 17:16.242
and refuse to treat her.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.741
The baby was gonna
suffer and die.

17:18.750 --> 17:21.822
So he took her
into the woods.

17:21.830 --> 17:23.786
To put her
out of her misery?

17:23.790 --> 17:26.998
No. He brought her
to bigger minds

17:27.000 --> 17:28.911
than the doctors
of Bristol Cove.

17:28.920 --> 17:33.539
To people who weren't
afraid of shape-shifters.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.076
The Haida.

17:36.170 --> 17:37.876
Yes.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.324
She lived?

17:39.330 --> 17:43.209
The Haida helped her
to complete her transition,

17:43.210 --> 17:46.168
and she lived
for a very long time.

17:46.170 --> 17:51.290
I am her
last living descendant.

17:51.290 --> 17:53.497
You're one of them?

17:53.500 --> 17:56.378
That's right.

17:56.380 --> 17:58.610
One-eighth to be exact.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.111
Ryn, did you know this?

18:02.330 --> 18:03.319
Yes.

18:03.330 --> 18:07.209
I sense She is one Of US.

18:07.210 --> 18:10.452
But I did not know
the child lived.

18:11.830 --> 18:14.412
Can you... change?

18:14.420 --> 18:16.240
[laughs] Oh, no.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.239
No, I'm, uh...

18:17.250 --> 18:19.957
generations
removed from that.

18:19.960 --> 18:24.169
So... So if
you're a descendant
of Charles Pownall,

18:24.170 --> 18:25.239
that means that--

18:25.250 --> 18:28.378
You and I, we're related.

18:30.330 --> 18:32.207
Does my family know?

18:32.210 --> 18:34.451
That's for you to ask them.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.326
You will be buried here?

18:38.330 --> 18:39.376
Yes.

18:39.380 --> 18:42.247
Along with these poor souls

18:42.250 --> 18:44.878
trapped between two worlds.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.371
This is exactly
where Donna belongs.

18:51.670 --> 18:54.616
We will bring sister here.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.069
Day drinkin', huh?

18:58.080 --> 19:02.198
Thinkin' that Janine
said no to movin' in?

19:02.210 --> 19:04.166
Aw, dude, don't
take it too personally.

19:04.170 --> 19:05.956
It's just, you know,
three's a crowd.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.746
You got that right.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.377
You guys just get
your own place.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.666
Look, I know that
you're strapped for cash,

19:11.670 --> 19:13.240
but, um, I was thinkin',

19:13.250 --> 19:16.458
first thing tomorrow,
we take out the boat.

19:16.460 --> 19:17.324
I need a first mate.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.616
Janine told me, Xander,

19:19.620 --> 19:21.451
about why she'd be
so uncomfortable

19:21.460 --> 19:24.247
with all of us sharing
the apartment together?

19:24.250 --> 19:27.242
You know,
seeing as how you two
slept together?

19:27.250 --> 19:28.660
[laughs]
She told you that?

19:28.670 --> 19:31.742
Yeah, she told me that.

19:35.330 --> 19:37.958
Hey, Calvin, man,

19:37.960 --> 19:39.916
look, I would have told you.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.320
Okay, but it was
a while ago.

19:42.330 --> 19:43.957
I mean, it was before
you guys were even serious,

19:43.960 --> 19:45.871
and then when you got serious,
it just seemed like,

19:45.880 --> 19:47.279
I didn't know
how to bring it up.

19:47.290 --> 19:48.416
And then all this other stuff
started to happen.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.115
You know what? I--

19:50.120 --> 19:51.701
I can't do this with you
right now, all right?

19:51.710 --> 19:53.246
What about our plans?

19:53.250 --> 19:55.036
The business? The boat?

19:55.040 --> 19:57.668
That's gonna have to stay
on hold right now, okay?

19:57.670 --> 19:59.661
Maybe until I don't
want to beat the crap
out of you.

19:59.670 --> 20:00.659
Come on.

20:00.670 --> 20:03.241
Come on, Calvin.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.911
Calvin!

20:08.750 --> 20:10.615
[seagulls calling]

20:17.080 --> 20:19.321
[blowing softly]

20:26.500 --> 20:29.242
Sister's new home.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.450
Ryn's too.

21:23.540 --> 21:29.206
[Siren song echoing]

21:37.170 --> 21:40.458
[Ben] Why didn't you tell me
that Helen is our relative?

21:40.460 --> 21:43.111
Look, Charles had an affair
with a woman in town.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.111
Okay? She worked
at a local bar.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.280
A brothel.

21:46.290 --> 21:48.372
What, so she was
a prostitute?

21:48.380 --> 21:50.109
You can imagine--

21:50.120 --> 21:51.872
an extramarital affair,
a child out of wedlock

21:51.880 --> 21:53.700
_ with a woman
in that profe55ion.

21:53.710 --> 21:55.496
These aren't things
people talked about
back then.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.877
Every family
has its secrets, Ben.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.451
This isn't some kind
of ancient history, Dad.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.746
I have a relative
|iVing in town,

22:02.750 --> 22:04.411
one that I've known
my whole life.

22:04.420 --> 22:06.991
You know our family, Ben.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.377
This kind of history,
nothing they'd want out there.

22:09.380 --> 22:11.416
Why dwell on the ugliness?

22:11.420 --> 22:12.956
Okay, Charles
was a troubled guy.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.951
We talked about that.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.372
From what I understand,
he had a lot of demons.

22:17.380 --> 22:21.419
So we just act
like it never happened?

22:21.420 --> 22:23.661
Like it's nothing
to do with us?

22:26.040 --> 22:29.373
I'm sorry, Ben, if you
feel like we haven't
been honest with you.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.956
Look, I'm worried
about you.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.825
Your mom is, too.

22:34.830 --> 22:37.071
Maybe I made a mistake
bringing you out here,

22:37.080 --> 22:38.570
stickin' you behind a desk.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.662
I was bein' selfish.

22:40.670 --> 22:42.570
You were so happy
at the Research Center,

22:42.580 --> 22:43.786
let's rethink it.

22:43.790 --> 22:44.996
Get back over there,
out on the water,

22:45.000 --> 22:46.410
clear your head.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.240
That's where
you're the happiest.

22:48.250 --> 22:49.456
What do you say?

22:49.460 --> 22:50.996
I think it'll
do you some good.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.456
Yeah.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.785
I gotta go.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.822
The more time
you spend on land,

23:13.830 --> 23:15.912
the more resilient
you'll become.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.912
Grief, loss.

23:18.920 --> 23:22.492
They lessen with time.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.741
It's a part of being human.

23:24.750 --> 23:28.709
I will always be sad.

23:28.710 --> 23:31.326
I know it feels
like that now,

23:31.330 --> 23:34.037
but it'll get easier.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.951
We'll help you
get through it.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.667
You will help,

23:38.670 --> 23:40.661
like I help Ben.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.820
When Sean died?

23:42.830 --> 23:44.570
You helped him?

23:44.580 --> 23:46.992
Ben was sad.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.286
He asked me to sing.

23:49.290 --> 23:50.609
It made him feel better.

23:50.620 --> 23:52.872
Ben asked you
to sing to him

23:52.880 --> 23:54.575
after Sean died?

23:54.580 --> 23:57.708
Yes. After party.

23:57.710 --> 23:59.610
I sang.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.668
Are we talkin'
about the Siren song?

24:03.120 --> 24:04.747
Do you know what it means?

24:04.750 --> 24:07.742
My ancestors always said
it had different meanings.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.160
Great love to some,

24:09.170 --> 24:12.537
but for others,
it could be dangerous.

24:12.540 --> 24:13.780
Dangerous how?

24:13.790 --> 24:15.576
Oh, you've read the books.

24:15.580 --> 24:19.368
Mythologists called it
a euphemism for obsession.

24:24.540 --> 24:26.167
If anyone asks,

24:26.170 --> 24:28.707
I'm heading to
the town council meeting.

24:28.710 --> 24:30.280
-[phone ringing]
-All right.

24:30.290 --> 24:32.747
Pruitt County Sheriff's.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.115
Sheriff, wait!

24:36.540 --> 24:38.781
We got a 10-56 reported
at the beach.

24:38.790 --> 24:40.917
[sighs]

24:40.920 --> 24:42.319
Well, let's go.

24:45.420 --> 24:46.990
[rock music playing in bar]

24:53.330 --> 24:55.161
Xan.

24:55.170 --> 24:57.661
Heard the sheriff
let you out.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.069
Yeah.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.571
Time off
for good behavior.

25:03.620 --> 25:06.248
She died, Xan.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.535
Ryn's sister.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.609
We tried to save her.

25:11.620 --> 25:13.747
If I could take it
all back, I would.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.286
You know that.

25:15.290 --> 25:18.578
Yeah. Sure, I do. I--

25:18.580 --> 25:20.491
I was messed up, man.

25:21.710 --> 25:24.452
I mean, they killed my dad.

25:25.790 --> 25:28.247
But you were right.

25:28.250 --> 25:31.287
I gotta let it go, man.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.201
[voice grows muffled]
Move on.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.661
It's all we can do.

25:36.670 --> 25:40.572
[Siren song echoing]

25:46.420 --> 25:47.785
[Xander] Ben!

25:47.790 --> 25:48.529
You with me?

25:52.960 --> 25:55.417
Yeah. Sorry, man.

25:55.420 --> 25:56.705
I'm-- I'm here.

25:56.710 --> 25:58.701
Come on,
let me get you a beer.

26:03.580 --> 26:05.957
We found and ID.
in his car.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.281
Name's Aldon Decker.

26:08.290 --> 26:09.780
Based on the contents
of his briefcase,

26:09.790 --> 26:11.667
looks like he had
a military clearance.

26:11.670 --> 26:12.705
Pretty high level.

26:16.540 --> 26:18.917
Get the coroner out here.

26:18.920 --> 26:21.320
Cordon off this area.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.538
[phone ringing]

26:25.500 --> 26:26.535
Dad?

26:26.540 --> 26:28.701
My team found another body.

26:28.710 --> 26:31.417
Aldon Decker.

26:31.420 --> 26:34.742
That's that military guy
from last night, right?

26:34.750 --> 26:36.115
Yes, it's him.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.530
I don't understand.
He was just here.

26:37.540 --> 26:38.666
How did he die?

26:38.670 --> 26:41.412
[Dale] Looks like a suicide.

26:41.420 --> 26:43.115
Drowned himself in the ocean.

26:45.620 --> 26:47.076
Decker killed himself.

My sister,

26:49.290 --> 26:52.168

27:15.790 --> 27:16.950
Hey, dude.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.496
Jerry, have you seen Ben?

27:18.500 --> 27:19.785
Yeah, he was here
a little while ago.

27:19.790 --> 27:20.950

30:26.210 --> 30:28.110
No, before that.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.111
I-- I heard your voice.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.452
That's why I went
down there.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.872
You were there, right?

30:34.880 --> 30:36.950
No.

What does this mean?

30:51.080 --> 30:52.991
I didn't know my song could

30:54.290 --> 30:56.747

you can find on Decker.

I thought you were gonna try
to make that meeting.

31:23.790 --> 31:25.030
Yeah, I'm sorry.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.917
I got a lot going on, Ted.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.114
Another dead body.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.781
A suicide.

31:29.790 --> 31:31.075
You know the guy?

31:31.080 --> 31:33.787
I never seen him before.

31:33.790 --> 31:37.282
The council's pretty annoyed,
I gotta tell you.

31:37.290 --> 31:39.952
They're asking
all kinds of questions.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.702
Is it true you had someone
in custody for Donnie's murder?

31:42.710 --> 31:45.747
-Yeah, that's right.
-What happened?

31:45.750 --> 31:47.115
I didn't have
the evidence, Ted.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.997
I had to let her go.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.786
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

31:50.790 --> 31:53.167
They're talking
about investigating it,

I don't want to see
that happen.

31:56.170 --> 31:58.035
Come on, Dale.
Help me out here.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.951
Give me somethin'
I can go back to them with.

32:04.420 --> 32:05.956
You wouldn't believe me
if I did.

32:08.420 --> 32:09.535
Try me.

32:23.040 --> 32:28.034
Can you just try to
tell me what was going
through your head?

32:28.040 --> 32:30.167
Why did you go in the water?

32:30.170 --> 32:33.207
Ithought
she was in trouble.

32:33.210 --> 32:35.246
I wanted to help her.

32:35.250 --> 32:37.161
But she wasn't there.

32:37.170 --> 32:39.161
Yes, I know that, Maddie.

32:39.170 --> 32:42.458
It's the song, isn't it?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.075
What do you mean?

32:44.080 --> 32:46.207
Decker committed suicide.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.166
Donna drove him insane.

32:49.170 --> 32:50.319
He drowned himself.

32:50.330 --> 32:52.241
What?

32:52.250 --> 32:56.209
And now you just dove
in the water by yourself
with no tank.

32:56.210 --> 32:57.746
No, I wasn't--

32:57.750 --> 32:59.661
That's-- That's
not what I was doing.

32:59.670 --> 33:02.036
Why did you ask Ryn
to sing to you again?

33:02.040 --> 33:03.746
I don't know.

33:03.750 --> 33:06.537
It used to feel like
whatever was happening
with either of us,

33:06.540 --> 33:08.280
we were in it together,

33:08.290 --> 33:11.327
at work, at home,
and then with Ryn.

33:11.330 --> 33:13.491
I loved that.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.912
Yeah. Me, too.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.410
But now it feels
like something's changed.

33:17.420 --> 33:20.821
You-- You're pushing me away.

33:20.830 --> 33:22.707
No, that's
not what I'm doin'.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.701
It is, Ben.
I know what that feels like.

33:24.710 --> 33:26.075
I grew up with it.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.326
You're comparing me
to your mother?

33:32.080 --> 33:34.742
I guess maybe I am.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.320
Because it sure
feels the same.

33:38.290 --> 33:40.997
It's not the relationship
I want to have.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.283
I think I need
to go stay with my dad.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.109
Maddie.

33:58.330 --> 34:00.457
I love you.

34:00.460 --> 34:01.666
You know that, right?

34:03.250 --> 34:05.241
I love you, too.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.378

with one of your editors.

they're gonna want to hear.

up in arms before,

in the street.

with a good story.

we can't give them.

more and more questions.

about what you tell him.

just leave him to me.

It brings us close.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.452
It did.

39:00.460 --> 39:03.611
So I think the song is good,

39:03.620 --> 39:06.453

to sing again.

feel better.
