WEBVTT

03:07.560 --> 03:08.922
No meat today.
Sorry, miss.

03:13.302 --> 03:15.434
No coke, miss.
Sprite.

03:16.305 --> 03:17.304
Sprite.

03:49.503 --> 03:50.601
- <i> Senorita?</i>

03:51.967 --> 03:54.308
<i>-Senorita?</i>

03:56.939 --> 03:59.379
<i>Senorita,</i> you tell to me

03:59.414 --> 04:01.381
if you're intending
to remain very long.

04:03.880 --> 04:04.879
<i>Senorita?</i>

04:08.522 --> 04:10.423
<i>-Senorita?</i>

04:14.495 --> 04:16.594
<i>Senorita?</i>

04:16.629 --> 04:19.993
If possible
I will wait for you.

04:21.535 --> 04:23.502
<i>-Senorita?</i>

04:24.098 --> 04:25.438
<i>Si, si, si, si.</i>

04:31.644 --> 04:32.973
So good to
see you again.

05:14.456 --> 05:16.654
Young rebels
used to be so sexy.

05:18.493 --> 05:19.624
Aren't you
looking at me?

05:27.667 --> 05:29.667
-Are you coming?
-Yeah.

05:29.702 --> 05:30.932
-Are you coming?

05:30.967 --> 05:31.933
<i>-Si.</i>
-Are you coming?

05:31.968 --> 05:33.737
-Uh-huh.<i> Si.</i>
-So, come!

05:43.518 --> 05:44.913
What a fucking joke.

06:02.735 --> 06:04.900
- You are getting
more skinny, eh.

06:06.475 --> 06:08.871
If you get
any more skinny,

06:09.874 --> 06:11.511
I don't want you
no more.

06:23.558 --> 06:25.789
-Do you have
any talcum powder?
<i>-Que?</i>

06:38.606 --> 06:40.441
No, talcum powder.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.611
I must tell you
something.

06:54.556 --> 06:55.555
Yes.

06:59.121 --> 07:00.659
The moment has come

07:00.694 --> 07:02.595
when I must
take your press card

07:02.630 --> 07:04.058
and your letter
of authority.

07:05.732 --> 07:06.797
What are you saying?

07:09.131 --> 07:10.570
You're not a journalist.

07:13.135 --> 07:14.904
Yes, I am.

07:15.742 --> 07:16.807
No, you're not.

07:17.810 --> 07:19.139
I am, too,
a journalist.

07:19.812 --> 07:21.746
No, you're not.

07:21.781 --> 07:23.814
Hey, hey. What...
Give me that!

07:25.983 --> 07:28.049
And the press card?

07:28.084 --> 07:29.853
-Where is the press card?
-I don't have my press card.

07:29.888 --> 07:31.789
-Yes, you have.
-No, I don't.
It's back at the motel.

07:31.824 --> 07:33.186
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.829
It is invalidated.

07:38.864 --> 07:39.863
Who invalidated it?

07:41.735 --> 07:42.734
I am forced to.

07:46.267 --> 07:48.168
One of these days,

07:48.203 --> 07:49.774
the army will
arrest you.

07:51.008 --> 07:52.205
And this letter

07:53.340 --> 07:54.812
carries my name.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.781
This is my name.

07:57.619 --> 07:58.651
Veraguas.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.686
-You understand?
-I understand.

08:00.721 --> 08:02.556
Everyone who reads it
sees my name.

08:02.591 --> 08:04.525
Fucking all pimps.
You're all fucking pimps!

08:05.121 --> 08:06.285
Fucking jackass.

08:08.124 --> 08:09.123
- Yes!

08:10.599 --> 08:11.598
Yes!

08:13.063 --> 08:15.899
I left many
messages for you,

08:16.737 --> 08:18.264
but you never responded.

08:18.299 --> 08:19.298
Why that is?

08:21.137 --> 08:22.642
I am forced...

08:26.175 --> 08:28.109
I am forced to wonder.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.211
-You were
forced to wonder?
-Mm-hmm.

08:32.214 --> 08:33.347
I am forced
to tell you that

08:33.382 --> 08:37.019
you said you would
replace my phone
which you broke.

08:44.930 --> 08:47.700
I'll be needing
some shampoo.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.901
I will buy for you
the shampoo with
much pleasure.

08:53.037 --> 08:55.576
Very generous,
<i>Subtenente</i> Verga.

09:15.796 --> 09:17.928
I'm waiting for
my chauffeur.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.669
If it is quite okay...

09:24.431 --> 09:28.169
If it is quite okay
not to call me
under this name,

09:28.204 --> 09:29.742
Verga.

09:29.777 --> 09:33.174
My name, it's Veraguas.

09:33.209 --> 09:37.948
And it is
<i>"subtenente".</i>

09:40.788 --> 09:44.020
<i>Subtenente.</i>

09:54.934 --> 09:56.230
- Where do
you wish to go?

09:59.070 --> 10:01.367
- You wish
the InterContinental.

10:01.402 --> 10:03.105
- Yes. I wish.

10:07.177 --> 10:10.684
Car reeks big time
even with the mask on.

11:00.329 --> 11:01.361
<i>Senor?</i>

11:01.968 --> 11:03.066
<i>Ola!</i>

11:49.576 --> 11:50.916
- <i> Gracias.</i>

12:37.525 --> 12:39.096
Martini,<i> por favor.</i>

12:39.131 --> 12:40.394
<i>Como estas?</i>

13:08.424 --> 13:09.423
- <i> Gracias.</i>

13:25.606 --> 13:26.946
May I have a cigarette?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.380
Uh, evening.

13:32.415 --> 13:34.514
I have none on me,
I'm sorry.

13:36.089 --> 13:37.187
You're English.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.090
I am.

13:40.423 --> 13:42.060
London, currently.

13:43.426 --> 13:44.491
Where are you from?

13:46.396 --> 13:48.231
Uh, here and there
and yonder.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.497
What about yourself?

13:51.698 --> 13:53.236
Didn't we just do that?

14:00.113 --> 14:01.145
Miguel?

14:03.083 --> 14:04.313
Alphonso?

14:05.283 --> 14:06.315
Roberto?

14:07.648 --> 14:09.054
<i>Si.</i>

14:09.089 --> 14:10.121
She's a little wet.

14:11.355 --> 14:12.552
There's too
much vermouth.

14:17.097 --> 14:18.360
Smell the bamboo
in here?

14:22.201 --> 14:23.662
It's not the nicest
smell, is it?

14:27.338 --> 14:28.535
You have the kind of
good manners

14:28.570 --> 14:30.042
that eventually
get you killed.

14:32.112 --> 14:33.111
<i>Gracias.</i>

14:37.546 --> 14:40.085
We have 45 minutes
till the bar closes.

14:41.682 --> 14:43.154
Long enough
to get swacked.

14:44.685 --> 14:46.091
Wanna try a gin
with me?

14:47.061 --> 14:48.291
What brought you here?

14:50.130 --> 14:51.393
I came on a plane.

14:53.232 --> 14:55.034
I suppose I met
all your motives.

14:56.070 --> 14:57.333
I can tell you
my motives.

14:58.633 --> 15:02.173
I wanted to know
the exact dimensions
of hell.

15:22.096 --> 15:23.359
Are you for sale?

15:24.659 --> 15:26.032
I'm press.

15:26.496 --> 15:27.660
We're all press.

15:29.499 --> 15:31.235
Then we're all
for sale.

15:33.804 --> 15:38.110
I came here as
a special correspondent
up in the north area.

15:40.081 --> 15:41.080
Really?

15:42.644 --> 15:44.446
It's one of
the rougher spots,
is it not?

15:45.119 --> 15:46.118
In a sense.

15:47.550 --> 15:48.784
What made you leave?

15:52.654 --> 15:54.093
It was nothing.

15:55.558 --> 15:58.097
Girl scout camp
for refugees.

15:58.132 --> 15:59.395
Right, right, right.

16:02.499 --> 16:03.663
And what about you?

16:06.173 --> 16:08.173
Me? I'm, uh...

16:08.208 --> 16:11.176
I'm here with
the Watts people.

16:12.476 --> 16:14.707
I say "with",
but I'm here alone.

16:16.150 --> 16:18.216
The Watts people,
the oil company?

16:18.713 --> 16:21.318
Yeah, on, uh,

16:21.353 --> 16:24.255
a charitable cause,
you could say.

16:24.290 --> 16:26.488
-Please don't go
into detail.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.293
No, I just mean,
how many companies

16:29.328 --> 16:30.261
do you think,
at the moment,

16:30.296 --> 16:32.395
would consider investing
in a place like this?

16:33.299 --> 16:34.727
Not many I'd imagine.

16:36.104 --> 16:37.367
No, next to none.

16:38.634 --> 16:42.834
That's all in the name
of profit, but, uh...

16:42.869 --> 16:44.638
I don't know,
I still that the idea
of throwing

16:44.673 --> 16:48.081
some business
their way has
humanitarian overtones.

16:53.385 --> 16:55.418
Now that we know
each other so well...

16:58.786 --> 17:00.423
...care for some supper?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.692
I think
it's kind of late.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.299
For a price,
I'll sleep with you.

17:57.713 --> 17:59.251
- Your skin
is so white.

18:00.551 --> 18:01.583
It's like

18:02.586 --> 18:04.223
being fucked
by a cloud.

18:06.854 --> 18:08.227
You're just a mist.

18:08.559 --> 18:09.558
Yes.

18:10.825 --> 18:12.198
A mist.

19:57.371 --> 19:58.799
Don't panic, baby.

20:02.376 --> 20:03.408
It's your room.

20:07.876 --> 20:09.612
I wanna be paid
in dollars.

20:15.389 --> 20:16.685
Everybody wants dollars.

20:18.590 --> 20:20.788
There's talk
they're gonna roll up
the Cordoba.

20:25.894 --> 20:27.025
Roll up?

20:27.599 --> 20:28.598
Yeah.

20:30.833 --> 20:31.865
- Fuck me.

20:32.901 --> 20:34.571
Would I have to
pay extra for that?

20:38.478 --> 20:40.412
I have no
dollar supply.

20:41.514 --> 20:44.383
I live entirely on
black-market Cordobas.

20:53.361 --> 20:54.426
Don't worry.

20:57.827 --> 20:59.959
You don't have
to start thinking
how to ditch me.

21:01.897 --> 21:03.435
I'm not here
for your dollars,

21:03.470 --> 21:05.305
I'm here for
the air-conditioning.

21:12.006 --> 21:13.907
You're thinking so
hard how to ditch me

21:13.942 --> 21:15.513
that your head
is smoking.

21:19.948 --> 21:22.454
What do you have
to say about that?

21:22.489 --> 21:24.654
I was thinking
about something
quite a bit different.

21:34.061 --> 21:35.995
I commit
adultery often.

21:46.678 --> 21:48.513
I never really
miss anybody.

21:55.687 --> 21:57.885
I feel I'm in
danger of throwing
my life away.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.063
Shall we meet again?

22:47.640 --> 22:48.936
Again and again.

22:50.874 --> 22:52.907
Anytime you have 50 US.

22:52.942 --> 22:55.074
Right. Of course.

22:58.519 --> 23:01.487
I don't usually
fall asleep in
somebody else's bed.

23:04.525 --> 23:06.019
I like your style.

23:08.793 --> 23:10.859
Normally,
in my dark heart,

23:11.928 --> 23:13.862
I look down on
the impoverished

23:13.897 --> 23:15.798
lackeys of
pig billionaires

23:15.833 --> 23:17.932
with their poor
report string back.

23:31.046 --> 23:32.210
Take a shower
if you want.

23:36.722 --> 23:38.986
I have running water
in my hotel, baby.

23:42.090 --> 23:44.860
"Impoverished lackeys."

24:46.594 --> 24:48.891
See how fast
the tropics sap you?

27:40.097 --> 27:42.097
<i>-Buenos dias.</i>
-- <i> Buenos dias.</i>

29:23.970 --> 29:24.969
No.

30:15.153 --> 30:16.449
-- Hello.
<i>-Hello.</i>

30:18.422 --> 30:20.618
-Hello?
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

30:20.653 --> 30:22.422
- I've got you.
I've got you fine.

30:22.457 --> 30:23.929
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Hi.

30:23.964 --> 30:25.557
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>it's very early here.</i>

30:25.592 --> 30:27.229
<i>I mean, I'll just say</i>
<i>what I said again.</i>

30:27.264 --> 30:30.166
<i>Why would</i>
<i>a monthly magazine</i>

30:30.201 --> 30:34.566
<i>that specializes</i>
<i>in sustainable</i>
<i>high-class travel,</i>

30:34.601 --> 30:36.403
<i>be interested in</i>

30:37.241 --> 30:39.307
<i>any events,</i>

30:39.342 --> 30:41.947
<i>any person,</i>
<i>any fucking thing</i>

30:41.982 --> 30:44.950
<i>from the continent</i>
<i>of Nicaragua?</i>

30:44.985 --> 30:47.315
Continent? Uh,
your geography is
a little off there, buddy.

30:47.350 --> 30:49.581
But I'm saying that
I can get you
a wonderful piece

30:49.616 --> 30:52.683
on a nature reserve
in, in Costa Rica.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.026
You'll wake up
to the sound of
howler monkeys,

30:55.061 --> 30:56.621
you'll have
a deluxe tent

30:56.656 --> 30:57.722
and a private
bathroom,

30:57.757 --> 30:59.558
which is a real steal
in the midst this pandemic.

31:00.231 --> 31:01.164
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:01.199 --> 31:02.627
<i>Well, I'd love to</i>
<i>be woken up</i>

31:02.662 --> 31:04.695
by howler monkeys
at- 00 a.m.,

31:04.730 --> 31:08.105
<i>but not by you,</i>
<i>Trish. No offense.</i>

31:08.140 --> 31:10.668
<i>Is this gonna be</i>
<i>another one</i>
<i>of these, like,</i>

31:10.703 --> 31:12.003
<i>"Send me</i>
<i>X amount of cash</i>

31:12.038 --> 31:14.474
<i>"and you'll never,</i>
<i>ever hear from</i>
<i>me again"?</i>

31:14.509 --> 31:16.443
<i>Because we already</i>
<i>did that.</i>

31:16.478 --> 31:18.544
You're hearing
from me right now.

31:18.579 --> 31:21.646
And if you could just
get me to Costa Rica,

31:21.681 --> 31:24.418
I promise you
I'll get my act
together.

31:24.453 --> 31:26.519
Things aren't
as simple here
as you wanna think.

31:26.554 --> 31:28.356
<i>Okay.</i>

31:28.391 --> 31:30.655
<i>How about this?</i>
<i>Is this simple enough?</i>

31:30.690 --> 31:32.195
<i>Fuck you.</i>

31:32.230 --> 31:34.296
-I am employed by you.

31:34.331 --> 31:39.268
<i>You have never, ever,</i>
<i>been employed by me.</i>

31:39.303 --> 31:42.469
<i>Not never,</i>
<i>not never, ever.</i>

31:42.504 --> 31:44.636
<i>You did some</i>
<i>piece work for us,</i>
<i>Trish.</i>

31:46.145 --> 31:48.508
<i>That's it. You were</i>
<i>like a temp, okay?</i>

31:50.083 --> 31:52.017
-What are you
trying to say?

31:52.778 --> 31:53.811
<i>I'm trying to</i>
<i>say something</i>

31:53.846 --> 31:56.186
<i>along the lines</i>
<i>of what I just said,</i>

31:56.221 --> 31:57.990
<i>which is,</i>

31:58.025 --> 32:00.256
<i>we don't need</i>
<i>your stories about</i>

32:00.291 --> 32:02.060
<i>missing persons</i>
<i>or murder.</i>

32:02.095 --> 32:04.524
<i>I can watch that</i>
<i>on CNN, okay? Just...</i>

32:04.559 --> 32:07.362
<i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>admit to yourself</i>
<i>you're not a journalist?</i>

32:08.233 --> 32:09.265
<i>All right?</i>

32:09.300 --> 32:10.970
<i>And stop calling me.</i>

32:12.732 --> 32:15.040
-Can I please, uh...
<i>-Trish? Trish?</i>

32:15.075 --> 32:16.239
<i>Do you have my number?</i>

32:16.802 --> 32:18.307
Yep.

32:18.342 --> 32:20.474
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Lose it, okay?</i>

32:20.509 --> 32:23.213
<i>Bye-bye,</i> senorita.
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

32:28.286 --> 32:29.747
Oh, use the other
fucking door

32:29.782 --> 32:31.155
because this one
doesn't open?

32:31.190 --> 32:32.585
Pay in dollars
or use the other
fucking door?

32:32.620 --> 32:33.452
Just wait until
American tanks

32:33.488 --> 32:34.994
come and crush
your hopeless country.

32:38.197 --> 32:39.163
Either way
the American tanks

32:39.198 --> 32:41.429
are gonna come
and fucking crush
your country!

33:20.437 --> 33:22.569
-Only chicken today.
-Rum.

33:39.258 --> 33:40.290
- <i> Gracias.</i>

34:25.337 --> 34:27.403
Um...

34:32.410 --> 34:34.278
I'm an American
journalist,

34:35.611 --> 34:38.282
and I'm going
home tomorrow.

34:41.386 --> 34:42.880
Tomorrow
or the day after.

34:46.457 --> 34:47.456
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

35:51.588 --> 35:52.587
<i>Gracias.</i>

36:09.034 --> 36:10.033
No, I think
it's great.

36:10.069 --> 36:11.936
It's just a matter of
how much time it takes.

36:29.054 --> 36:30.262
- Great.

36:31.496 --> 36:33.265
Um, it should
be fine...

37:30.951 --> 37:32.588
-- Thanks.
-Welcome, sir.

38:07.493 --> 38:09.493
I had a reason
for ignoring you.

38:12.597 --> 38:13.596
It's okay,

38:16.029 --> 38:17.699
whatever my
true feelings.

38:18.537 --> 38:20.031
Oh. I'm sorry.

38:24.741 --> 38:27.775
Consorting with
unescorted women is
no disgrace, Daniel.

38:27.810 --> 38:29.843
No, it wasn't that.
I was...

38:30.912 --> 38:32.879
I was concerned
for your reputation.

38:38.051 --> 38:39.523
Who's that
friend of yours?

38:41.857 --> 38:44.561
He has a project
to grow rice
with rainwater.

38:45.564 --> 38:46.893
What I do
interests him.

38:48.963 --> 38:50.567
He's a Costa Rican cop.

38:53.704 --> 38:55.066
No.

38:57.070 --> 38:58.377
Yes.

38:59.072 --> 39:00.775
He's from the O-E-Jota.

39:06.112 --> 39:07.980
What do you know
about the OIJ?

39:08.851 --> 39:10.620
O-E-Jota.

39:10.655 --> 39:12.116
Those are
the Costa Rican cops.

39:12.151 --> 39:13.986
No, I know that.

39:15.088 --> 39:16.758
This man's not a cop.

39:18.894 --> 39:20.091
Yes, he is.
And he's waiting
for you

39:20.126 --> 39:21.829
outside of the hotel
right now.

39:24.163 --> 39:25.437
What have you got
to do with them?

39:25.472 --> 39:26.735
Or do I not
want to know?

39:34.877 --> 39:36.008
Is it cold enough?

39:40.586 --> 39:42.520
-I'll take a beer,
thank you.

39:48.759 --> 39:50.825
Are you familiar with
the American expression

39:50.860 --> 39:53.795
"you've got your ass
in a sling"?

39:53.830 --> 39:55.995
I'm familiar with most
of your expressions.

39:58.538 --> 40:00.065
I'm familiar with
a lot of things.

40:03.741 --> 40:04.971
If you don't mind me
saying so,

40:05.006 --> 40:07.138
I'm familiar with
the way that whores

40:07.173 --> 40:10.141
try desperately
to act as if
they feel superior

40:10.176 --> 40:11.681
to those of us
who pay them,

40:11.716 --> 40:12.715
when actually,

40:13.751 --> 40:15.487
you feel quite inferior.

40:17.018 --> 40:18.985
Actually, I think
you feel ashamed.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.789
Ooh.

40:22.958 --> 40:25.860
Why didn't you look at
the waiter just now?

40:25.895 --> 40:27.763
Why don't you
look at me when
I'm talking to you?

40:30.163 --> 40:32.768
'Cause there's
nothing to see.

40:32.803 --> 40:35.133
If there's nothing
to see, then why
don't you look at me?

40:35.168 --> 40:36.673
If I'm no one.

40:38.578 --> 40:39.577
Okay.

40:41.746 --> 40:43.042
Let's back this up
a little bit, okay?

40:43.077 --> 40:44.879
Because, actually,
I'm not the one

40:44.914 --> 40:47.211
the O-E-Jota's
waiting for outside
the InterContinental,

40:47.246 --> 40:48.520
am I?

40:49.182 --> 40:50.918
Well, he's not the OIJ.

40:52.185 --> 40:53.657
O-E-Jota.

40:56.893 --> 40:57.892
All right.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.061
-Thank you.

41:04.637 --> 41:06.637
Can I have one of
those Belmonts, please?

41:18.013 --> 41:19.716
Does he say
he's your friend?

41:21.984 --> 41:23.049
He does.

41:24.349 --> 41:25.986
Then don't talk
to him anymore.

41:27.187 --> 41:28.527
Did he say his name?

41:31.697 --> 41:35.325
-He showed me his ID.
-- Okay.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.865
You're so fucking
out of it.

41:39.837 --> 41:41.265
Don't speak
with him anymore.

41:43.005 --> 41:44.103
Forget him.

41:46.008 --> 41:47.172
Do you have a gun?

41:48.142 --> 41:49.174
Shoot him.

41:49.209 --> 41:53.046
I don't have a gun.

41:57.118 --> 41:59.624
I bet that
if we leave this
hotel right now,

42:01.287 --> 42:02.594
he'll follow us.

42:03.894 --> 42:06.026
He's waiting
for you outside.

42:06.061 --> 42:07.929
And he's not gonna
let you get away.

42:10.131 --> 42:11.229
You're drunk.

42:12.936 --> 42:14.133
Would I be
sitting here

42:14.168 --> 42:16.003
if I were the littlest
bit sober?

42:16.709 --> 42:18.038
No, no.

42:21.714 --> 42:22.977
Let's go to my room.

42:25.850 --> 42:27.179
Do you have 50 US?

42:28.688 --> 42:29.951
I have 50 US.

42:31.053 --> 42:32.657
Good.

42:32.692 --> 42:35.088
Give it to me,
I need to buy some
shampoo.

42:35.123 --> 42:37.057
We're gonna go
to the Mercado Oriental

42:37.092 --> 42:38.355
and you'll see
we're being followed.

42:40.733 --> 42:41.963
Let's lose the cop.

42:45.298 --> 42:46.297
<i>Senor?</i>

42:56.683 --> 42:58.210
-- Okay.
-- <i> Gracias.</i>

43:00.379 --> 43:02.654
-Come on.

43:07.991 --> 43:09.826
Nothing like running
away in an old Toyota.

43:25.778 --> 43:27.008
That's him.

43:27.043 --> 43:28.680
That's him right there.

43:28.715 --> 43:29.846
They have
the Costa Rican plates,

43:29.881 --> 43:32.079
they look like the new
California ones.

43:32.114 --> 43:34.081
-You know?
No, I don't know.

43:41.189 --> 43:43.156
It's ridiculous.

43:43.191 --> 43:45.190
I'm pretty sure,
he knows where
I'm staying.

43:49.263 --> 43:51.197
We'll lose them down
at the Mercado.

43:55.203 --> 43:56.268
- No.

44:10.889 --> 44:13.186
What's going on?
Is he still there?

44:13.221 --> 44:16.860
I can't see a thing.

44:37.443 --> 44:38.442
<i>Senor.</i>

44:49.554 --> 44:50.861
I understand.

44:54.262 --> 44:55.492
- Thank you.

45:13.853 --> 45:15.413
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you all right?

45:17.956 --> 45:19.417
You insist
I'm plastered.

45:20.024 --> 45:21.892
I'm fine.

45:21.927 --> 45:23.520
I have the use
of my legs.

45:23.555 --> 45:24.862
Okay.

45:25.425 --> 45:26.424
Okay, very good.

45:39.978 --> 45:42.044
I need to buy
some shampoo.

45:42.079 --> 45:43.815
- You didn't
like the one you stole
from me?

45:45.346 --> 45:46.345
Okay.

45:48.316 --> 45:49.513
I gotta get some rum.

46:08.435 --> 46:09.500
<i>Gracias.</i>

46:19.512 --> 46:21.512
Aww. Throw this away.

46:21.547 --> 46:24.482
There won't be
any elections, babe.
I promise.

46:24.517 --> 46:25.890
Happening next week.

46:44.009 --> 46:47.538
Rum and shampoo.

46:58.551 --> 46:59.550
<i>Gracias.</i>

47:06.999 --> 47:09.230
I should get my hair
washed by a real
professional.

47:09.265 --> 47:11.001
<i>-Gracias.</i>

47:13.434 --> 47:14.631
- <i> Gracias.</i>

47:30.154 --> 47:33.122
- Mm.

47:33.157 --> 47:34.959
Don't blink
or you'll miss
the whole show.

47:36.721 --> 47:38.424
They'll postpone
the election again,

47:39.658 --> 47:41.064
and they'll blame
the US.

47:43.134 --> 47:44.133
It'll happen.

47:47.369 --> 47:48.669
Why?

47:48.704 --> 47:52.504
Why would they risk
losing all of this power
now that they have it?

47:52.539 --> 47:55.705
Because there are
people here who still
have principles.

47:55.740 --> 47:56.948
- Oh.

47:57.709 --> 48:00.314
Like what?
What principles?

48:03.319 --> 48:04.417
Democracy,

48:05.288 --> 48:06.419
equality.

48:08.357 --> 48:09.356
Starbucks.

48:13.131 --> 48:14.559
I didn't know
why I bother.

48:16.464 --> 48:17.595
Me neither.

48:19.170 --> 48:21.170
-Go, go, go!

48:23.108 --> 48:26.373
You, my friend,
just made
1,000 Cordobas.

48:28.410 --> 48:30.443
-Fuck the Rica!
Fuck the Rica!
-You are a piece of work.

48:45.592 --> 48:48.098
Hey. Stop, stop, stop.

48:48.133 --> 48:49.495
What you doing?
-One moment.

48:49.530 --> 48:50.595
What are you doing?

48:52.137 --> 48:53.136
- <i> Gracias.</i>

48:54.634 --> 48:56.568
That Costa Rican
would've had
plenty of time

48:56.603 --> 48:57.435
to shoot you
in your back.

48:57.471 --> 48:59.010
-Right.
-Bang.

48:59.045 --> 48:59.944
I can feel it.

48:59.980 --> 49:02.574
Bang.

49:30.802 --> 49:32.241
It's my pleasure.

49:43.320 --> 49:44.484
This is my hotel.

49:46.752 --> 49:48.257
- Where's
all the money from?

49:50.756 --> 49:52.558
- That's not
your kind of question.

49:55.497 --> 49:56.595
Are you
a little tense?

49:58.698 --> 49:59.730
Should I be tense?

50:00.766 --> 50:03.074
- Watch out
for dog doo doo
and kitty plop.

50:06.211 --> 50:08.277
You're amazing,
you know that?

50:08.312 --> 50:10.741
Nothing stops you.
Not rain,

50:10.776 --> 50:12.545
not car chases,
not dog shit.

50:20.588 --> 50:22.126
-Any calls?
-No.

50:23.195 --> 50:24.194
Hmm.

50:39.640 --> 50:40.705
It's, uh,

50:41.873 --> 50:43.774
nice subdued lighting.

50:49.815 --> 50:52.090
-One bulb.

51:46.410 --> 51:47.574
You have a back door.

51:48.247 --> 51:49.246
Mm-hmm.

51:51.283 --> 51:53.184
This room was originally
hired by the hour.

51:54.253 --> 51:55.648
So,

51:55.683 --> 51:56.847
come through the door,

51:57.751 --> 51:59.388
you pay,

51:59.423 --> 52:01.588
nobody sees your face,

52:01.623 --> 52:02.853
nobody gets your name.

52:04.692 --> 52:07.561
For a life like that.

52:13.536 --> 52:15.536
-It's a life like another.

52:46.371 --> 52:49.735
I think maybe
I've made
a big mistake.

54:46.821 --> 54:48.018
Hey, Englishman.

54:51.859 --> 54:54.464
My sweaty,
sweaty Englishman.

54:55.764 --> 54:57.401
You're gonna
be boiled alive.

55:38.103 --> 55:40.708
Black. No milk today.

55:47.079 --> 55:48.419
<i>Por favor.</i>

55:58.728 --> 56:00.629
Isn't that what you
call my motel?

56:01.027 --> 56:02.631
Today? Tomorrow?

56:18.979 --> 56:20.979
Please speak
very loud and slow.

56:21.883 --> 56:23.883
<i>Yes. Okay.</i>

56:23.918 --> 56:25.918
Can I come
to the office?

56:27.757 --> 56:29.757
-Please say yes.
<i>-Yes.</i>

56:30.694 --> 56:31.759
Soon?

56:32.498 --> 56:33.596
<i>Before noon.</i>

56:33.631 --> 56:36.192
Okay, I'll come
right now.

56:36.227 --> 56:38.568
<i>Certainly,</i>
<i>but don't hurry.</i>

56:39.197 --> 56:40.636
<i>Not to the office.</i>

56:41.738 --> 56:43.738
<i>Wait for me</i>
<i>at my club.</i>

57:14.606 --> 57:15.968
Eat me!

57:24.814 --> 57:25.813
<i>Ola.</i>

58:06.955 --> 58:07.954
<i>Si.</i>

58:58.875 --> 58:59.874
<i>Si.</i>

59:31.677 --> 59:34.777
You know
how I like you.

59:36.011 --> 59:39.881
Not only I like you,
I'm fond of you.

59:41.049 --> 59:42.180
You're very beautiful.

59:48.826 --> 59:49.825
<i>Si.</i>

1:00:01.135 --> 1:00:02.134
Please.

1:00:04.138 --> 1:00:06.974
Please, please
buy a plane
ticket for me.

1:00:07.009 --> 1:00:08.008
Please.

1:00:09.110 --> 1:00:10.109
No.

1:01:08.004 --> 1:01:09.201
Miss Johnson?

1:01:11.942 --> 1:01:13.777
Miss Johnson, it's me,

1:01:13.812 --> 1:01:15.042
<i>Subtenente</i> Veraguas.

1:01:16.144 --> 1:01:17.242
Miss Johnson?

1:01:22.414 --> 1:01:23.446
Miss Johnson?

1:01:27.518 --> 1:01:28.924
Miss Johnson?

1:01:47.043 --> 1:01:48.405
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:50.341
To The InterContinental,
please.

1:01:50.376 --> 1:01:51.375
Okay, sir.

1:02:02.025 --> 1:02:03.519
Do you have
some time out of you?

1:02:04.225 --> 1:02:05.796
Yes, sir.

1:02:05.831 --> 1:02:07.292
Are you able to wait
for a few minutes?

1:02:07.327 --> 1:02:09.294
If, uh, near the hotel,

1:02:09.329 --> 1:02:10.933
if I ran up for
a quick shower,

1:02:10.968 --> 1:02:13.397
and you can
take me to the Plaza
de la Revolucion,

1:02:13.432 --> 1:02:15.135
to the Ministry?

1:02:15.170 --> 1:02:17.940
-Yes, sir. Yeah.
-- Thank you.

1:02:30.889 --> 1:02:32.383
We can stop here.

1:02:32.418 --> 1:02:33.890
No, but this way today
to go to the...

1:02:33.925 --> 1:02:34.858
No, no, no, no.
It's fine.

1:02:34.893 --> 1:02:37.124
We can just wait
here for one,
for a moment.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.098
Just one moment.

1:02:48.170 --> 1:02:49.367
You see that guy?

1:02:51.371 --> 1:02:52.568
Costa Rican scumbags.

1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:56.539
What a bullshit.

1:02:56.574 --> 1:02:59.146
They'll take anyone
at that hotel.

1:02:59.181 --> 1:03:01.049
I have a room
at the hotel.

1:03:01.084 --> 1:03:02.985
And a girlfriend
at the motel.

1:03:04.549 --> 1:03:05.715
See, man,

1:03:05.750 --> 1:03:08.991
this hotel is
high security for
foreigners like you,

1:03:09.026 --> 1:03:10.025
not for us.

1:03:20.433 --> 1:03:23.203
American puppets.
Your compatriots.

1:03:24.536 --> 1:03:26.008
I'm not an American.

1:03:30.476 --> 1:03:32.047
You've got problems
with your phone?

1:03:32.676 --> 1:03:33.884
No, it's fine.

1:03:35.151 --> 1:03:36.645
We can't get them
fixed in here.

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:38.614
It's fine,
thank you.

1:03:38.649 --> 1:03:40.220
But what would
you do with it?

1:03:40.255 --> 1:03:41.958
I will throw it away.

1:03:41.993 --> 1:03:44.092
No, man.
Give it to me.

1:03:45.458 --> 1:03:47.128
You don't want it,
you understand?

1:03:47.163 --> 1:03:49.328
It's, uh,
it's dangerous.

1:03:51.596 --> 1:03:53.365
No, man, not for me.

1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:55.400
It's easy to
sell in here.

1:03:55.435 --> 1:03:57.369
Show me.
I can make
them traceable.

1:04:03.410 --> 1:04:05.278
-Can I keep it?
-Yeah.

1:04:06.248 --> 1:04:07.445
What do we do now?

1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:09.480
We do nothing.

1:04:09.515 --> 1:04:12.351
We, uh, we just wait.

1:04:12.386 --> 1:04:15.024
Yeah, fuck them.

1:04:50.127 --> 1:04:52.193
I live at a height
above the things.

1:04:56.430 --> 1:04:57.693
I believe you
can help me.

1:05:00.071 --> 1:05:01.565
How did you find
our eggs?

1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:03.072
I have chicken
at my house.

1:05:04.339 --> 1:05:06.075
I am fond of eggs,

1:05:06.110 --> 1:05:08.473
but I...
I don't need eggs.

1:05:08.508 --> 1:05:10.442
I need to speak
to your coyote.

1:05:10.477 --> 1:05:12.642
I can get beer,
come my friend's house.

1:05:12.677 --> 1:05:14.677
And the man
who will get cash
right here

1:05:14.712 --> 1:05:16.745
in the Plaza Espana,
is my cousin.

1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:18.989
I can buy cash from him
at a good price.

1:05:20.157 --> 1:05:21.420
Can I speak to
the coyote now?

1:05:29.133 --> 1:05:30.198
<i>Ola.</i>

1:05:36.437 --> 1:05:37.502
<i>Gracias.</i>

1:05:59.724 --> 1:06:01.163
I want to verify you.

1:06:04.663 --> 1:06:06.630
I don't want you
to verify me.

1:06:06.665 --> 1:06:09.765
Then I have no money
for you. No US.

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:12.372
That much money
come from
the black market.

1:06:12.407 --> 1:06:14.044
I don't want no trouble.

1:06:14.079 --> 1:06:15.078
No.

1:06:16.081 --> 1:06:17.311
No trouble.

1:06:17.346 --> 1:06:20.050
Hmm. No passport,
no dollars.

1:06:22.615 --> 1:06:25.616
-Fuck you.
-Fuck is a good word.

1:06:25.651 --> 1:06:28.784
Fuck is the property
of the whole world.

1:06:32.196 --> 1:06:36.462
You don't speak Spanish.
You don't speak Spanish.

1:06:39.533 --> 1:06:41.170
It's no good for you.

1:06:41.205 --> 1:06:43.271
Very bad situation.

1:06:43.306 --> 1:06:46.142
People from
Department of Defense
came to see me,

1:06:47.508 --> 1:06:48.705
and ask for you.

1:06:49.807 --> 1:06:52.610
They were very tough.
This is no good.

1:06:52.645 --> 1:06:54.183
Okay. Did you
tell them where I live?

1:06:54.218 --> 1:06:55.316
No. No.

1:06:56.748 --> 1:07:00.222
But they can
find out easy, fast.

1:07:02.787 --> 1:07:04.556
Wait, uh...
What did I do?

1:07:05.526 --> 1:07:07.460
Some of them
very bad.

1:07:08.166 --> 1:07:11.167
Go. Go now. Today.

1:07:11.202 --> 1:07:13.169
But, I...
Let's go outside

1:07:13.204 --> 1:07:15.105
and then you can
explain to me in Spanish
what's happening.

1:07:15.140 --> 1:07:17.470
-I want to understand.
-No.

1:07:17.505 --> 1:07:20.605
We can finish
our conversation
right now.

1:07:21.773 --> 1:07:23.311
You're my only
friend here.

1:07:23.346 --> 1:07:24.741
-Hmm.
-Please.

1:07:24.776 --> 1:07:25.874
Yeah?

1:07:25.909 --> 1:07:29.218
I hear you have
a new friend now.

1:07:37.162 --> 1:07:38.293
Okay, um...

1:07:40.165 --> 1:07:41.164
Fuck.

1:07:44.268 --> 1:07:46.433
I appreciate
what you've been
able to do for me.

1:08:06.785 --> 1:08:10.391
Hi. Uh, I would like
to speak to one of
your guests.

1:08:10.426 --> 1:08:12.492
Mr. Daniel DeHaven,
please.

1:08:13.363 --> 1:08:14.362
<i>He's not here.</i>

1:08:17.796 --> 1:08:19.664
Uh, can I leave
him a message?

1:08:20.964 --> 1:08:22.172
<i>He has checked out.</i>

1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:25.439
Um...

1:08:27.278 --> 1:08:28.344
Checked out?

1:08:28.379 --> 1:08:30.675
You mean
he took his luggage?
He's checked out,

1:08:30.710 --> 1:08:31.709
he's left?

1:08:32.679 --> 1:08:33.678
<i>Yes.</i>

1:08:39.884 --> 1:08:41.785
-Any calls?
-- No, miss.

1:09:18.263 --> 1:09:20.923
The Englishman
in trouble
is still here.

1:09:32.035 --> 1:09:33.870
The<i> senora</i> let you in?

1:09:35.874 --> 1:09:37.478
I've been hiding
here all day.

1:09:38.481 --> 1:09:40.514
Mm, really?

1:09:40.549 --> 1:09:42.813
And just what are
you planning to do?

1:09:57.335 --> 1:09:58.862
I need to go
back to my hotel.

1:10:02.505 --> 1:10:03.999
They told me
that you left.

1:10:07.070 --> 1:10:08.278
What do you
mean "left"?

1:10:09.413 --> 1:10:11.347
They said that
you checked out.

1:10:11.382 --> 1:10:12.909
You packed up
and you checked out.

1:10:16.453 --> 1:10:17.980
They told you
I checked out?

1:10:20.787 --> 1:10:22.325
I don't know.
I could have
got it wrong.

1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:24.261
It was over
the phone, so...

1:10:34.471 --> 1:10:35.668
Maybe I got it wrong.

1:10:42.677 --> 1:10:43.742
Um...

1:10:50.784 --> 1:10:52.982
Did you know
the Department of Defense
is after you?

1:10:55.624 --> 1:10:57.789
You never said anything
about those people.

1:11:02.697 --> 1:11:04.664
I didn't really
think that anyone
was after me.

1:11:07.768 --> 1:11:09.031
Do you think it now?

1:11:12.102 --> 1:11:14.641
Will you help me
get my things
from my hotel?

1:11:16.414 --> 1:11:18.513
Certainly not.

1:11:19.978 --> 1:11:21.780
No, I'm serious.
I can't. No.

1:11:21.815 --> 1:11:23.683
If I help you,
then I'm going to
end up wishing

1:11:23.718 --> 1:11:25.014
that I never
met you once.

1:11:33.464 --> 1:11:35.563
Unless, of course,
you have a MasterCard
or an Amex.

1:11:35.598 --> 1:11:36.762
Because when you
buy me a plane ticket,

1:11:36.797 --> 1:11:38.093
then I'll see what
I can do for you.

1:11:39.866 --> 1:11:42.064
I do have an Amex,
but I can't use it.

1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:44.133
It's a company card.

1:11:44.168 --> 1:11:47.707
I tried to get
money out earlier
and it's blocked.

1:11:48.809 --> 1:11:50.545
You said that
you didn't leave
the hotel.

1:11:50.580 --> 1:11:52.074
Hmm.

1:11:52.109 --> 1:11:54.450
That's fishy.
Guy like you without
a card to his own name.

1:11:54.485 --> 1:11:55.946
I do have a card
in my own name.

1:11:57.554 --> 1:11:59.081
It's in my coat.

1:11:59.116 --> 1:12:01.050
At the hotel.

1:12:06.926 --> 1:12:08.860
I'm tired.

1:12:08.895 --> 1:12:11.962
I'm tired. I'm tired
and I've got to rest.

1:12:11.997 --> 1:12:14.701
And every time
I turn around,

1:12:16.100 --> 1:12:17.165
they're jamming
something

1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:18.771
under somebody
else's fingernails.

1:12:46.163 --> 1:12:47.965
This is the worst
time of day.

1:12:50.574 --> 1:12:53.003
This is the worst time
of my whole life.

1:13:00.881 --> 1:13:04.553
What did you do
when you were
stateside?

1:13:04.588 --> 1:13:05.554
If you don't
mind me asking.

1:13:07.888 --> 1:13:10.625
A little of this,
and then a little
bit of that.

1:13:13.223 --> 1:13:15.432
Mainly a little
of this, I suppose?

1:13:17.194 --> 1:13:19.601
I suppose, that's what
you want to hear.

1:13:43.055 --> 1:13:45.088
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

1:13:45.123 --> 1:13:47.222
Don't go.
You're in danger.

1:13:47.257 --> 1:13:48.993
I need go to
the Intercontinental.

1:13:50.260 --> 1:13:51.963
Need to know
if I was checked out.

1:13:51.998 --> 1:13:52.997
You're in danger.

1:14:00.105 --> 1:14:01.137
Hey!

1:14:02.305 --> 1:14:03.975
Wait. Hey!

1:14:05.748 --> 1:14:06.945
You walk too fast.

1:14:09.719 --> 1:14:10.718
I need a drink.

driver died.

1:18:51.099 --> 1:18:53.000
I recognize
that cab driver.

1:18:57.468 --> 1:18:58.808
He's from around.

1:19:05.476 --> 1:19:07.212
It's too bad
you got checked out.

1:19:13.924 --> 1:19:15.352
It's too bad
they took your gun.

1:19:18.929 --> 1:19:19.928
What gun?

1:19:24.396 --> 1:19:26.099
-No, no, no.
It's British Airways.

1:19:26.134 --> 1:19:28.101
I don't control
when their offices
are open.

1:19:28.136 --> 1:19:29.135
I told you this before.

1:19:31.403 --> 1:19:32.567
Just one more call.

1:19:32.602 --> 1:19:34.338
<i>Por favor.</i>

1:19:34.373 --> 1:19:35.944
-No!
-It's quick!

1:19:37.178 --> 1:19:38.474
I can pay you,
for God's sake.

1:19:40.951 --> 1:19:42.251
-I can pay.
-No.

1:19:42.286 --> 1:19:44.117
Hey, can you help me?
She doesn't understand
what I'm saying.

1:19:44.152 --> 1:19:45.151
Ah, miss?

1:19:52.556 --> 1:19:53.896
What's she saying?

1:19:53.931 --> 1:19:55.231
She wants you
to pay for the room.

1:19:55.266 --> 1:19:58.560
I can pay for the room.
I can pay for the room
and the phone.

1:19:58.595 --> 1:20:00.133
So, what's this
about British Airways?

1:20:00.168 --> 1:20:01.871
You're planning some
kind of quick exit?

1:20:03.402 --> 1:20:06.370
Can you call the hotel?
They have
my ticket information.

1:20:06.405 --> 1:20:07.503
Ticket information?

1:20:07.538 --> 1:20:09.472
-Why not use
your phone?
-Please!

1:20:10.376 --> 1:20:11.540
Please, just call them.

1:20:26.524 --> 1:20:27.523
- Thank you.

1:20:35.566 --> 1:20:36.598
Okay. Will you
ask for me,

1:20:36.633 --> 1:20:39.469
Daniel DeHaven,
Watts Oil.

1:20:39.504 --> 1:20:41.603
-Do you expect me
to find you there?
-I don't know.

1:20:41.638 --> 1:20:44.947
Just see if
I've been completely
checked out.

1:20:44.982 --> 1:20:46.278
And maybe someone's
left something for me.

1:20:47.380 --> 1:20:48.544
-A clean shirt...
<i>-Ola.</i>

1:20:56.125 --> 1:20:57.223
Says you've checked out.

1:21:00.195 --> 1:21:01.359
Okay. Can I
speak to her?

1:21:05.431 --> 1:21:08.036
--Can I speak to her?

1:21:09.699 --> 1:21:11.237
Hello. This is Daniel.

1:21:15.474 --> 1:21:16.506
In English, please.

1:21:18.114 --> 1:21:21.247
In English, please.
I can't understand.

1:21:21.282 --> 1:21:23.579
I can't understand.
She's speaking
in Spanish. Can you?

1:21:54.777 --> 1:21:56.381
I can explain
about the ticket.

1:21:57.219 --> 1:21:58.449
Just give me a minute.

1:22:02.554 --> 1:22:03.553
Excuse me.

1:22:06.063 --> 1:22:07.062
Excuse me.

1:22:18.735 --> 1:22:19.734
Please.

1:22:32.056 --> 1:22:33.121
Is...

1:22:33.750 --> 1:22:34.749
Is something funny?

1:22:35.653 --> 1:22:37.191
Hmm?

1:22:37.226 --> 1:22:39.391
You're still...
You're laughing.

1:22:42.330 --> 1:22:43.593
What is your
name, please?

1:22:45.102 --> 1:22:46.101
Hmm?

1:22:48.138 --> 1:22:49.467
I have a bad head
for names.

1:22:53.704 --> 1:22:56.540
- I lived in the US
for four years.

1:22:56.575 --> 1:22:59.510
Got married to
my wife there.

1:22:59.545 --> 1:23:02.282
My two little girls,
they go to boarding school
in Virginia.

1:23:03.252 --> 1:23:04.548
So, don't fuck with me.

1:23:05.716 --> 1:23:06.715
Okay?

1:23:07.685 --> 1:23:09.157
That is my statement.

1:23:12.129 --> 1:23:12.928
Okay.

1:23:14.527 --> 1:23:15.757
-I'm going back...
-Okay.

1:23:15.792 --> 1:23:18.430
Excuse me.
No. No.

1:23:18.465 --> 1:23:20.069
I told you already once.
Don't fuck with me

1:23:20.104 --> 1:23:21.796
or I'm going to
fuck with you.

1:23:21.831 --> 1:23:23.534
So, you better let me
take your passport.

1:23:23.569 --> 1:23:25.668
-You can't have
my passport.
-I can't?

1:23:25.703 --> 1:23:28.275
I'm under
the protection of
the Nicaraguan government.

1:23:28.310 --> 1:23:29.543
You are?

1:23:29.578 --> 1:23:31.377
You're under
the protection of
the Nicaraguan government.

1:23:31.874 --> 1:23:33.082
Where are they?

1:23:36.219 --> 1:23:38.252
I know your English
friend is inside.

1:23:40.553 --> 1:23:42.256
Do you think
this is a fucking game?

1:23:44.788 --> 1:23:45.587
Hm?

1:23:47.263 --> 1:23:48.592
-I can't talk.
-What do you believe?

1:23:49.298 --> 1:23:50.497
What do you believe?

1:23:50.533 --> 1:23:53.564
You believe that
you can take this guy
to the Mercado,

1:23:54.567 --> 1:23:55.566
fuck him, it's fine,

1:23:55.602 --> 1:23:58.602
and then...
...it's finished?

1:23:59.242 --> 1:24:00.241
Huh?

1:24:01.310 --> 1:24:03.112
-Did you fuck him?
-Let go of me.

1:24:03.147 --> 1:24:04.707
-Huh?
-Hey! Let go of me.
Let go of me.

1:24:04.742 --> 1:24:05.774
Let go of me!
Let go of me.

1:24:05.809 --> 1:24:06.841
You're just
a Costa Rican cop,

1:24:06.876 --> 1:24:07.842
and you have
no control over me.

1:24:07.877 --> 1:24:11.252
I am listening outside
of your window, bitch.

1:24:14.257 --> 1:24:16.488
Do you know how many
people are playing
in your fucking game?

1:24:17.623 --> 1:24:19.425
A lot of people
are involved.

1:24:21.165 --> 1:24:22.626
-Hm.

1:24:23.563 --> 1:24:24.760
You have some
on you.

1:24:26.269 --> 1:24:28.203
Huh?

1:24:28.238 --> 1:24:30.535
You think you're
going to take
this guy, fuck him,

1:24:30.570 --> 1:24:32.636
and then just like that,
you say, "It's finished"?

1:24:32.671 --> 1:24:34.836
No. You're going
to have a lot of
explanation

1:24:34.871 --> 1:24:36.343
to take care of,
goddammit!

1:24:37.775 --> 1:24:40.248
You're just another
fucking cunt
playing games.

1:25:17.452 --> 1:25:20.255
I thought you'd gone.

1:25:20.290 --> 1:25:21.289
I'm still here.

1:25:22.688 --> 1:25:24.424
- I thought
I got rid of you.

1:25:24.855 --> 1:25:25.854
Come inside.

1:25:34.403 --> 1:25:35.765
Did you see
who was out there?

1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:37.206
Yeah. That's why
I came here.

1:25:40.508 --> 1:25:41.771
Says he listens
to us fucking.

1:25:43.643 --> 1:25:44.807
I can't think.

1:25:45.777 --> 1:25:47.183
My mind won't function.

1:25:53.389 --> 1:25:54.718
Fuck you.

1:25:59.659 --> 1:26:01.461
I don't need it anymore.
I can get rid of it.

1:26:03.927 --> 1:26:04.926
- Your phone.

1:26:05.830 --> 1:26:06.829
- Yeah.

1:26:10.538 --> 1:26:12.604
Who is he?
Who is that Costa Rican?
What's he doing here?

1:26:12.639 --> 1:26:13.803
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

1:26:14.806 --> 1:26:15.739
I don't know who he is.

1:26:15.774 --> 1:26:16.840
I don't know if he's
operating by himself.

1:26:16.875 --> 1:26:19.380
I don't...
I don't know who
he's in touch with.

1:26:21.714 --> 1:26:23.450
Okay, well, you're
the one that's
supposed to face him,

1:26:23.485 --> 1:26:25.386
and I'm the one
that's getting
my windows peeked into.

1:26:28.688 --> 1:26:30.886
You came here to
do business, yeah?

1:26:30.921 --> 1:26:31.953
Do you have
any contacts?

1:26:31.988 --> 1:26:33.361
I don't have
any contacts.

1:26:33.726 --> 1:26:34.725
Do you?

1:26:36.795 --> 1:26:37.794
Yeah.

1:26:38.995 --> 1:26:41.666
I have a half-senile
VC ministro

1:26:41.701 --> 1:26:44.273
at the inter turismo
who can't get hard,

1:26:44.308 --> 1:26:46.539
and a<i> subtenente</i>
that can.

1:26:48.675 --> 1:26:52.446
And they both just
got done cutting me
loose because of you.

1:26:56.650 --> 1:26:58.683
I'll be out, all right?
I'll be out by night.

1:26:58.718 --> 1:26:59.915
You can't just
leave me now.

1:26:59.950 --> 1:27:01.653
That's fucking horrible.

1:27:07.364 --> 1:27:08.363
I'm caught.

1:27:11.830 --> 1:27:13.027
All right. I'm caught.

1:27:25.415 --> 1:27:26.414
I love you.

1:27:57.414 --> 1:27:58.446
No.

1:28:36.717 --> 1:28:37.782
<i>Gracias.</i>

1:28:51.798 --> 1:28:52.797
You're right.

1:29:33.972 --> 1:29:36.478
I told them my<i> esposo</i>
would pay for it.

1:29:44.785 --> 1:29:45.784
I'm tired.

1:29:47.821 --> 1:29:49.183
I'm having my period.

1:30:28.565 --> 1:30:29.729
Be gentle.

1:30:41.743 --> 1:30:43.842
You never
did it like this
with you wife?

1:30:47.815 --> 1:30:49.111
I'm glad you let me.

1:30:54.690 --> 1:30:56.151
Please keep me.

1:31:28.691 --> 1:31:29.954
<i>Vamos! Vamos! Vamos!</i>

1:31:29.989 --> 1:31:31.021
Get out!

1:31:31.056 --> 1:31:32.286
Move it!

1:31:32.321 --> 1:31:33.727
Let's go! Move it!

1:32:39.091 --> 1:32:40.288
- You don't
want to sit up front?

1:32:41.665 --> 1:32:42.895
I'm tired.

1:32:44.294 --> 1:32:45.634
Need to rest.

1:32:49.431 --> 1:32:51.299
Are you sure
you want to
leave with me?

1:32:53.974 --> 1:32:55.237
You're almost
out of gas.

1:32:56.845 --> 1:32:57.844
I guess so.

1:32:59.276 --> 1:33:00.682
I don't know this city.

1:33:04.182 --> 1:33:05.753
See, you do need me.

1:33:09.121 --> 1:33:10.120
Yeah.

1:33:11.189 --> 1:33:12.320
I need you.

1:33:23.399 --> 1:33:24.398
Can you pass me
a cigarette?

1:33:58.742 --> 1:34:00.137
This is our honeymoon.

1:34:36.043 --> 1:34:37.207
I need to sleep.

1:34:48.220 --> 1:34:50.253
Let's just die here.

1:34:59.132 --> 1:35:00.736
Are we in a hurry?

1:35:05.072 --> 1:35:07.171
Let me try and
take a shower first.

1:35:10.407 --> 1:35:11.747
I stink.

1:35:13.817 --> 1:35:16.213
Didn't you hear me?
I said we have
no towels.

1:35:31.098 --> 1:35:34.000
You want me to think
that you're so tough
and cynical.

1:35:37.401 --> 1:35:39.170
I know that you like
to be touched.

1:35:42.043 --> 1:35:43.878
There's no need
to pretend to cry.

1:35:52.581 --> 1:35:53.921
Suck me.

1:37:54.505 --> 1:37:55.911
- Excuse me.

1:37:56.342 --> 1:37:58.243
Uh, yes.

1:37:58.278 --> 1:37:59.442
You want to...

1:37:59.477 --> 1:38:01.015
Do you mind,
uh, sitting down

1:38:01.050 --> 1:38:03.116
and watching me
eat my breakfast or...

1:38:05.483 --> 1:38:07.252
Whatever I'm eating
is delicious.

1:38:12.721 --> 1:38:14.325
Beans, eggs, rice.

1:38:15.757 --> 1:38:17.229
Not from here.

1:38:17.264 --> 1:38:19.297
Mm. Where's it from?

1:38:19.332 --> 1:38:22.036
-Costa Rica.
-Ah. Costa Rica.

1:38:22.071 --> 1:38:25.006
Of course. I'm sorry.

1:38:25.041 --> 1:38:27.470
It's my first time
down in Central America.

1:38:27.505 --> 1:38:29.538
I work for
a consulting firm.

1:38:29.573 --> 1:38:31.342
Please, have a seat.

1:38:32.378 --> 1:38:33.509
It's my treat.

1:38:34.644 --> 1:38:36.985
We're the only customers
in here anyway, right?

1:38:39.220 --> 1:38:41.583
-It requires money
to eat here, so...
-Mmm.

1:38:41.618 --> 1:38:43.552
...you can bet
nobody in this town
has any.

1:38:45.259 --> 1:38:46.720
It's a little hot
over here.

1:38:46.755 --> 1:38:49.327
Do you mind moving
to the other side?

1:38:49.362 --> 1:38:50.999
It's a little shady
over there.

1:39:13.056 --> 1:39:14.781
Okay.

1:39:14.816 --> 1:39:18.059
It really gets me
how rude everybody
is down here.

1:39:18.094 --> 1:39:20.325
The way you
just ordered food was
just so impolite.

1:39:22.725 --> 1:39:25.066
-Impolite?
-Mm-hmm.

1:39:25.101 --> 1:39:27.101
Nobody says "please"
or "thank you."

1:39:27.136 --> 1:39:28.333
I really miss
the States.

1:39:29.204 --> 1:39:30.203
Where are you from?

1:39:33.076 --> 1:39:34.174
DC.

1:39:34.209 --> 1:39:35.505
This mash is pretty
good, though.

1:39:44.285 --> 1:39:46.285
What's the full name
of the company
that you work for?

1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:47.253
Because with
all these initials,

1:39:47.288 --> 1:39:49.750
you just never know
who you're talking to.

1:39:49.785 --> 1:39:52.159
You've got...
You've got "PS".

1:39:55.494 --> 1:39:56.592
Mm-hmm.

1:39:57.298 --> 1:39:58.396
MAPML.

1:39:59.564 --> 1:40:01.300
Don't ask me
what that stands for.

1:40:02.435 --> 1:40:03.467
And...

1:40:05.372 --> 1:40:06.371
Well...

1:40:06.868 --> 1:40:08.406
Then there's CIA.

1:40:09.508 --> 1:40:11.310
Well, we're actually
out of Connecticut.

1:40:12.181 --> 1:40:14.082
And, um,

1:40:14.117 --> 1:40:16.513
consulting is such
a weird business.

1:40:16.548 --> 1:40:20.616
Weird in the sense that
it gets completely blown
out of proportion.

1:40:20.651 --> 1:40:23.652
I'm not kidding.
I can't even believe
what they pay me.

1:40:23.687 --> 1:40:25.753
I'm working on
a report right now,

1:40:25.788 --> 1:40:28.525
and if I need anything,
anything at all,

1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:30.263
snap my fingers,
just like that.

1:40:31.365 --> 1:40:33.827
Say I wanted to
hire you to help me,

1:40:33.862 --> 1:40:35.433
hire you to
consult for me,

1:40:36.832 --> 1:40:40.273
I could just, um,
snap my fingers, and

1:40:42.442 --> 1:40:44.211
envelope of $20,000

1:40:46.182 --> 1:40:47.379
in your lap,
like that.

1:41:00.328 --> 1:41:03.296
Who are you
consulting for
down here?

1:41:05.498 --> 1:41:08.301
Who on Earth would
want to do business
in this country?

1:41:08.336 --> 1:41:11.634
Well, it's not
this country,
specifically.

1:41:11.669 --> 1:41:14.373
You know, um,
Central America
as whole

1:41:14.408 --> 1:41:16.441
is kind of like
a gambler's paradise.

1:41:16.476 --> 1:41:18.575
You know,
everybody is giving
the odds a shake,

1:41:18.610 --> 1:41:20.709
whichever game
they feel like playing.

1:41:20.744 --> 1:41:22.711
But, uh,
in all seriousness,

1:41:22.746 --> 1:41:25.417
there's, um,
wheat and rice
conglomerates

1:41:25.452 --> 1:41:27.815
that are looking out
at the land
around here.

1:41:27.850 --> 1:41:29.190
If you can
believe that.

1:41:30.226 --> 1:41:31.291
You bet I do.

1:41:35.792 --> 1:41:37.792
You're unbelievably
obvious.

1:41:39.697 --> 1:41:42.599
So, I mentioned
oil before, and...

1:41:44.372 --> 1:41:45.404
- Okay.

1:41:48.838 --> 1:41:50.739
Um, anyways,
I mentioned oil

1:41:50.774 --> 1:41:52.576
and parts of my report
actually touch

1:41:52.611 --> 1:41:54.512
on the petroleum
outlook in the area,

1:41:54.547 --> 1:41:57.812
and your friend
actually pops up in it,

1:41:57.847 --> 1:41:59.847
a couple of times,
as a matter of fact.

1:41:59.882 --> 1:42:02.520
And that is
if the guy you're
traveling with is

1:42:02.555 --> 1:42:04.324
the same person
that I'm thinking of.

1:42:04.854 --> 1:42:06.326
But...

1:42:08.396 --> 1:42:09.824
Anyway, the local
businesspeople

1:42:09.859 --> 1:42:12.398
are very level-headed
and serious.

1:42:15.469 --> 1:42:17.766
What do you mean
about my friend?

1:42:17.801 --> 1:42:19.207
Well, he's one
of the characters.

1:42:19.242 --> 1:42:20.835
Haven't you noticed?

1:42:20.870 --> 1:42:23.376
He's taking advantage
of the local elections

1:42:23.411 --> 1:42:25.279
and meddling with
the balance of power

1:42:25.314 --> 1:42:26.610
that was so difficult
to achieve.

1:42:34.917 --> 1:42:37.489
-Uh, coffee, please.
-Okay.

1:42:41.330 --> 1:42:42.857
What do you mean
about bringing up
my friend?

1:42:44.531 --> 1:42:46.300
My report is about
this region,

1:42:46.335 --> 1:42:48.764
and balance is
what this region
is all about.

1:42:50.768 --> 1:42:53.406
And so, what does
your job have to do

1:42:53.441 --> 1:42:55.705
with my friend?

1:42:55.740 --> 1:42:58.642
Well, that's
your friend coming
right now, isn't it?

1:43:00.613 --> 1:43:01.612
What does your report

1:43:01.648 --> 1:43:04.681
have to do
with my friend,
I've asked you!

1:43:04.716 --> 1:43:07.387
Well, like I said,
I don't even know
if it's the same person.

1:43:07.422 --> 1:43:10.753
He just happened
to wander in
and receive scrutiny,

1:43:10.788 --> 1:43:12.260
kinda like right now.

1:43:15.628 --> 1:43:16.825
Don't mind me.

1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:18.761
- Of course...
Of course not.

1:43:18.796 --> 1:43:20.829
Um, you see,
Central American
countries

1:43:20.864 --> 1:43:23.535
are looking for
the best way to
achieve balance,

1:43:23.570 --> 1:43:26.307
both economically
and politically.

1:43:26.342 --> 1:43:27.605
Even if that means
some sort of

1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:29.838
American military
involvement, but, um...

1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:34.612
It's not really
what we prefer,
is it?

1:43:35.780 --> 1:43:38.418
But then again,

1:43:39.553 --> 1:43:40.552
why not?

1:43:42.886 --> 1:43:43.951
Why not indeed?

1:43:45.691 --> 1:43:47.823
I'm just a consultant.
What do I know?

1:43:49.024 --> 1:43:50.826
Maybe enough to tell me
what to order.

1:43:51.092 --> 1:43:52.663
Oh.

1:43:52.698 --> 1:43:54.632
Well, if you're hungry,

1:43:54.667 --> 1:43:56.568
you should have
some of what I had.

1:43:56.603 --> 1:43:57.833
It's not bad at all.

1:43:59.441 --> 1:44:01.034
First gallo pinto
I've seen.

1:44:02.741 --> 1:44:04.543
We're getting closer
to Costa Rica.

1:44:06.382 --> 1:44:07.480
Is that where
you are, uh,

1:44:07.515 --> 1:44:09.647
where you guys
are heading? CR?

1:44:09.682 --> 1:44:10.846
What's going on
down there?

1:44:12.487 --> 1:44:14.487
CR, Costa Rica.

1:44:16.590 --> 1:44:18.084
Nothing special.

1:44:18.119 --> 1:44:20.020
Well, I've been
in San Jose
for about a month.

1:44:25.764 --> 1:44:29.062
I thought you said
this was your first time
in Central America.

1:44:29.097 --> 1:44:30.833
Pretty accommodating guy,
that Vice Minister

1:44:30.868 --> 1:44:32.868
in del turismo,
don't you think?

1:44:34.102 --> 1:44:36.036
-- <i> Gracias.</i>

1:44:36.071 --> 1:44:38.071
He's the one
that got me into
this whole mess.

1:44:40.383 --> 1:44:42.581
Made me change
my dollars
into Cordobas.

1:44:44.651 --> 1:44:45.749
Don't worry, babe.

1:44:46.917 --> 1:44:48.587
He already knows
all about us.

1:44:49.656 --> 1:44:51.359
I figured as much.

1:44:51.394 --> 1:44:53.625
- I can give you
a pretty good
exchange rate on those.

1:44:53.660 --> 1:44:54.923
If that's
what you want.

1:44:56.498 --> 1:44:58.498
Somehow, I'm not
surprised to hear that.

1:45:01.129 --> 1:45:02.667
Sorry to change
the subject.

1:45:02.702 --> 1:45:05.098
The, uh...
The election
interests me.

1:45:06.442 --> 1:45:09.377
Maybe we could
take a walk,
find a newspaper.

1:45:09.907 --> 1:45:11.973
- I'm thirsty.

1:45:12.008 --> 1:45:13.546
- Whores,
they all are.

1:45:14.175 --> 1:45:15.944
- Excuse me?

1:45:15.979 --> 1:45:18.012
- I mean,
they'll all do it
for enough money.

1:45:18.047 --> 1:45:18.879
Any of these women.

1:45:18.915 --> 1:45:23.083
Venezuelan, Costa-Rican,
doesn't matter.

1:45:23.118 --> 1:45:24.854
Why don't you go
grab one coming
out of church one day

1:45:24.889 --> 1:45:27.153
and give it a try,
and you'll see
what I mean.

1:45:27.188 --> 1:45:28.792
They're all as
lonely as widows.

1:45:28.827 --> 1:45:30.431
They haven't had
a man's hand
on their thighs

1:45:30.466 --> 1:45:31.861
since Jesus
was in diapers,

1:45:31.896 --> 1:45:33.467
or Moses
had a pacifier.

1:45:37.099 --> 1:45:38.406
We should get going,

1:45:39.607 --> 1:45:40.705
find that paper.

1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:48.845
Cordobas isn't
your only problem,
I hear.

1:45:51.014 --> 1:45:52.882
It seems you have
a passport issue
as well.

1:45:56.558 --> 1:45:58.426
How long have
you known him?

1:45:58.461 --> 1:46:00.494
Huh? Okay.
I know you haven't
known him for that long.

1:46:00.529 --> 1:46:01.957
I can tell by
your body language.

1:46:01.992 --> 1:46:03.025
Okay? Please.

1:46:03.060 --> 1:46:04.894
How do you know
who he is, who
he says he is?

1:46:04.929 --> 1:46:06.126
How do you
know he isn't...

1:46:06.161 --> 1:46:07.831
Okay. I get it,

1:46:07.866 --> 1:46:09.602
and understand
how exotic
everything feels.

1:46:09.637 --> 1:46:11.868
Everything is
ten volts higher.
Okay?

1:46:12.871 --> 1:46:13.903
And if I saw
somebody like you,

1:46:13.938 --> 1:46:15.542
I wouldn't ask
for references.

1:46:15.577 --> 1:46:18.578
So, you didn't
ask for references.
Big deal.

1:46:18.613 --> 1:46:19.942
It's a mistake,
but it's not a crime.

1:46:19.977 --> 1:46:22.076
Just another
absurd fuckhead.

1:46:22.111 --> 1:46:23.715
Look, look.
Listen, Ms. Johnson.

1:46:23.750 --> 1:46:27.015
Ms. Johnson, listen,
listen. Okay?

1:46:27.050 --> 1:46:29.919
I'm just here...
I don't care
what you think of me.

1:46:29.954 --> 1:46:31.087
I'm just here
to offer you

1:46:31.122 --> 1:46:33.494
the best deal that
I could make
across two borders.

1:46:33.529 --> 1:46:35.562
It's real
and it's straight.

1:46:35.597 --> 1:46:36.629
I don't understand
what kind of deal

1:46:36.664 --> 1:46:37.828
you think is being
offered to you.

1:46:41.999 --> 1:46:44.164
I think
you're offering
to screw me.

1:46:44.199 --> 1:46:45.605
Well, that is definitely
the one thing

1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:46.936
that I am not
offering to do.

1:46:48.104 --> 1:46:49.103
Excuse me.

1:46:50.172 --> 1:46:51.809
Is that polite
enough for you?

1:46:54.913 --> 1:46:56.209
What were you gonna do?

1:46:56.244 --> 1:46:57.782
How are you gonna
cross the border?

1:46:57.817 --> 1:47:00.015
By waving
the American flag, huh?

1:47:01.150 --> 1:47:03.216
- Wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait!

1:47:22.270 --> 1:47:23.511
Okay.

1:47:24.877 --> 1:47:25.975
Are you mad at me?

1:47:27.209 --> 1:47:28.714
Hey, are you
mad at me?

1:47:28.749 --> 1:47:29.913
Are you mad at me?

1:47:29.948 --> 1:47:31.211
I know.
You're mad at me.

1:47:31.246 --> 1:47:32.850
I know you're
mad at me.

1:47:32.885 --> 1:47:34.885
I know you're mad
at me.

1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:37.250
I know you're
mad at me.

1:47:37.285 --> 1:47:38.284
I know you're
mad at me,

1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:40.759
but are you mad at me
to the point of murder?

1:47:40.794 --> 1:47:42.959
- You're
a North American female,

1:47:42.994 --> 1:47:44.257
prostitute drifter

1:47:44.292 --> 1:47:46.226
with a press card
that's been revoked,

1:47:46.261 --> 1:47:48.162
and you drink like
a fucking Apache.

1:47:49.836 --> 1:47:51.704
You're gonna get us
both fucking killed!

1:47:53.268 --> 1:47:55.807
Just please,

1:47:55.842 --> 1:47:58.975
please level
with me.

1:47:59.010 --> 1:48:00.680
- I need to
feel like I'm moving.

1:48:48.356 --> 1:48:49.597
Fuck!

1:50:00.230 --> 1:50:01.966
You don't have
a passport, do you?

1:50:07.006 --> 1:50:08.137
And this whole
bloody mess

1:50:08.172 --> 1:50:09.776
was so you could
turn me in.

1:50:13.210 --> 1:50:14.682
- You're all wet.

1:50:18.380 --> 1:50:21.216
We're passing
into Costa Rica.

1:50:21.251 --> 1:50:23.823
I'm probably their
most-wanted fugitive.

1:50:24.991 --> 1:50:26.760
- That's much
better for you.

1:50:27.763 --> 1:50:29.697
Because from there,

1:50:29.732 --> 1:50:32.128
we can just cross
over into Panama.

1:50:33.131 --> 1:50:34.427
We'll be fine.

1:50:48.311 --> 1:50:50.311
It's better for you
or better for me?

1:51:02.127 --> 1:51:04.160
You really are
a whore.

1:52:25.210 --> 1:52:26.473
- Vaccination.

1:54:41.676 --> 1:54:44.149
Ah.

1:54:44.184 --> 1:54:46.217
I would've thought
you'd been out of
the country by now.

1:54:48.617 --> 1:54:51.585
I thought we had
some sort of
a connection before,

1:54:51.620 --> 1:54:54.159
um, that maybe
you understood.

1:54:54.194 --> 1:54:56.095
I guess it's possible
I was a little bit
too subtle

1:54:56.130 --> 1:54:58.966
but, um,
I'll be more direct.

1:54:59.001 --> 1:55:00.660
Your British friend
interests me,

1:55:00.695 --> 1:55:02.398
and I wanna include
background on him.

1:55:05.106 --> 1:55:06.468
Your report's
all about him?

1:55:06.503 --> 1:55:07.535
You could say that,

1:55:07.570 --> 1:55:09.669
but, look,
we're Americans.

1:55:09.704 --> 1:55:11.605
We're two
Americans, right?
We're friends.

1:55:12.509 --> 1:55:15.048
And, uh, let's
put it this way.

1:55:15.083 --> 1:55:18.744
Your travel companion
works for a rival outfit.

1:55:18.779 --> 1:55:21.318
And we'd like to
fuck up their action.

1:55:21.353 --> 1:55:23.122
It's basically
that simple, so...

1:55:23.157 --> 1:55:24.255
I just need
a signature on it,

1:55:24.290 --> 1:55:25.685
and that signature
has to be yours.

1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:27.357
I'm not
signing anything.

1:55:30.131 --> 1:55:32.263
Don't you know
what an asshole you are?

1:55:32.298 --> 1:55:34.463
Don't you know
what a delusional
asshole he is?

1:55:34.498 --> 1:55:36.069
Giving charts
and documents

1:55:36.104 --> 1:55:38.269
and a whole
economic future
to a rogue state.

1:55:40.702 --> 1:55:43.439
I believe he did it
in the interest
of fairness.

1:55:43.474 --> 1:55:44.607
Of course, he did.
Right?

1:55:44.642 --> 1:55:46.981
--- <i> Gracias.</i>

1:55:47.610 --> 1:55:49.379
-Yeah, he did.
-Yeah.

1:55:49.414 --> 1:55:50.446
Yeah.

1:55:51.515 --> 1:55:52.679
Yeah!

1:55:52.714 --> 1:55:54.384
And what if
the oil's not there?

1:55:57.092 --> 1:55:58.553
Does that
blur the edges
a little bit?

1:56:33.161 --> 1:56:34.292
We have a flat.

1:56:37.132 --> 1:56:39.165
We have to turn
and buy a new one.

1:56:42.302 --> 1:56:43.334
Go back.

1:57:33.650 --> 1:57:35.815
They smuggle stuff
across the border
every night.

1:57:40.558 --> 1:57:42.096
How much can
we pay them?

1:57:54.869 --> 1:57:56.143
A stolen car?

1:57:56.904 --> 1:57:58.772
Stolen, yeah.

1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:03.150
-Give more.
-Uh...

1:58:08.355 --> 1:58:09.585
I have some money.

1:58:11.952 --> 1:58:13.424
Um...

1:58:14.691 --> 1:58:16.328
Yeah. And watch?

1:58:16.726 --> 1:58:17.725
Okay.

1:58:19.201 --> 1:58:21.201
-Yeah?
-Okay.

1:58:21.236 --> 1:58:22.433
Let me grab something.

1:58:32.313 --> 1:58:33.510
I'm gonna change.

1:59:32.967 --> 1:59:34.604
-He's saying it's white?
-Just put that on

1:59:34.639 --> 1:59:37.002
because you can't
cross in a white
thing at night.

1:59:47.586 --> 1:59:49.685
It's not too late
for you to stay
if you want.

2:00:24.788 --> 2:00:26.425
- Move. Move!

2:00:41.607 --> 2:00:42.705
- Let me see.

2:00:45.611 --> 2:00:47.512
-I'm fine. It's fine.
-Okay. Let me see.

2:00:47.547 --> 2:00:48.777
- Let's get down.

2:00:48.812 --> 2:00:50.515
-- Jesus.
-Come.

2:00:54.884 --> 2:00:56.356
We really fucked up.

2:00:59.955 --> 2:01:01.856
Yeah. I fucked up.

2:02:52.067 --> 2:02:53.165
- Cover me up.

2:02:59.646 --> 2:03:00.744
Cover me up.

2:03:03.815 --> 2:03:06.948
Cover me up. Cover me up.
Cover me up. Cover me up.

2:04:11.718 --> 2:04:14.180
I will practice
my English with you.

2:04:14.215 --> 2:04:16.589
Your man from the CIA
saved you from death.

2:04:18.758 --> 2:04:19.988
- The CIA?

2:04:21.024 --> 2:04:22.727
It's obvious, I suppose.

2:04:30.572 --> 2:04:32.836
You know, you work
for despicable people.

2:04:34.576 --> 2:04:37.104
Maybe we could find
a room somewhere.

2:04:37.139 --> 2:04:39.612
The<i> senorita</i> will
find herself a hotel.

2:04:39.647 --> 2:04:42.747
But you,<i> senor,</i>
you come with us
and be arrested.

2:04:42.782 --> 2:04:44.617
No. No.

2:04:44.652 --> 2:04:46.751
-Hey. Hey. Hey!

2:04:47.886 --> 2:04:49.116
Don't.

2:04:49.151 --> 2:04:50.150
Daniel?

2:04:51.252 --> 2:04:52.251
Daniel?

2:04:55.630 --> 2:04:56.794
Daniel!

2:06:38.392 --> 2:06:40.766
- You're
very much like a team.

2:06:40.801 --> 2:06:42.999
We're an unbeatable team.

2:06:43.034 --> 2:06:45.430
Uh, two beers
and a napkin.
<i>Por favor.</i>

2:06:45.465 --> 2:06:47.003
American? English?

2:07:01.723 --> 2:07:04.086
Ugh. It's terrible.

2:07:08.994 --> 2:07:10.356
I don't like
people like you.

2:07:13.196 --> 2:07:14.932
I don't like
giving you money.

2:07:17.266 --> 2:07:19.398
Now, if you just
come over here,

2:07:19.433 --> 2:07:22.335
I need a signature,
please.

2:07:29.311 --> 2:07:31.377
I know it's a little bit
of a nuisance, but...

2:08:15.192 --> 2:08:16.488
That's good.
Thank you.

2:08:17.799 --> 2:08:18.996
I'm not depressed.

2:08:23.563 --> 2:08:24.771
- It's done.

2:10:03.135 --> 2:10:04.629
- What did
they do to you?

2:10:04.664 --> 2:10:06.268
Let me use a telephone.

2:10:10.637 --> 2:10:12.010
I'm coming, too.

2:10:16.511 --> 2:10:17.576
You could let us pass.

2:11:05.967 --> 2:11:07.164
<i>Senorita</i> Johnson.

2:11:10.334 --> 2:11:11.564
What are you
doing here?

2:11:17.539 --> 2:11:19.341
I came to return
your passport.

2:11:24.249 --> 2:11:25.611
I am forced to say

2:11:27.252 --> 2:11:28.449
I am sad today.

2:11:31.058 --> 2:11:32.453
I'm forced to say

2:11:34.721 --> 2:11:36.028
I will miss you.

2:11:44.203 --> 2:11:45.466
In a way...

2:11:51.474 --> 2:11:53.243
In a way,
you were good to me.
