01:00.840 --> 01:02.638
I'd forgotten
I used to be strong.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.592
I knew I could be again.
I had to...

01:08.680 --> 01:10.353
rescue myself.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.354
You see, it's the
Karpman triangle again.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.399
Does that make me

02:29.560 --> 02:31.677
<i>the senior colleagues

02:31.880 --> 02:34.349
we've decided to scale
the investigation down.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.640
You're giving up?

02:37.760 --> 02:39.831
No.
The investigation stays open.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.951
But we don't have any real
suspects or enough evidence

02:44.040 --> 02:46.077
to build a case that's going to
stand up in Court.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.160

we've been investigating.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.919

There is always a possibility

02:52.000 --> 02:53.434
that new evidence may be found.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.920
Someone may remember something
or someone may want to confess.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.593
People think the weight of guilt
will lessen with time

03:02.960 --> 03:05.429
but in my experience,
it's quite the opposite.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.719
I wasn't a child, it was...

06:20.080 --> 06:21.275
It was humiliating.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.992
How did Alistair
get that control?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.189
I gave it to him.

06:29.960 --> 06:30.960
Shameful.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.439

10:35.720 --> 10:36.870
I just want you to know, Al

10:36.960 --> 10:39.759
I think your decision to return
to Scotland is the right one.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.513
It's important
to get on with your lives.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.115
Thanks, mum.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.316

10:46.560 --> 10:47.560
No.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.274
Whether he's alive or not

10:56.360 --> 10:58.238
someone knows
what happened to him.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.434
They have to live with that.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.671
I just hope one day
we know the truth.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.480
Wouldn't you think if someone
was going to feel remorse

11:17.920 --> 11:19.559
they would have spoken up
by now?

11:20.320 --> 11:21.879
What if they didn't feel
remorse?

11:21.960 --> 11:23.599
They might have made a mistake.

11:26.800 --> 11:27.916
Or a slip up.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.160
Yes.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.117
That's what the police
were really hoping for, that

11:39.400 --> 11:41.073
someone close to
whoever took Noah

11:41.160 --> 11:43.200
should've seen something
and would have reported it.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.198
It's not as easy as that though,
is it?

11:50.200 --> 11:51.316
ALISTAIR: What do you mean?

11:52.560 --> 11:53.560
Well...

11:59.680 --> 12:03.310
Whoever took Noah must be
very good at hiding the truth.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.399
Even from those close to them.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.039
Well, it may not have been
one person.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.551

much better than one.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.312
OK, I can't even imagine that.

12:32.840 --> 12:33.840
No.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.749
No, you couldn't, mum.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.992
I want you to think about
coming to Scotland

12:43.000 --> 12:45.390
in the next six months or so,
and bringing Chloe with you.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200

13:17.080 --> 13:19.311

in Wildwood Bay

13:19.440 --> 13:23.116
when the search for their
missing child was in full swing.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.191
How would you characterise
their relationship?

13:30.640 --> 13:31.790
They were under...

13:32.640 --> 13:34.757
terrible, terrible stress

13:34.880 --> 13:37.395
and pressure at that time.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.915
So they fought?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.509
I didn't say that.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.234
They were coping with
a dreadful situation

13:44.720 --> 13:46.154
the best way they could.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.513
How did you think Joanna
responded

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
to the loss of her child?

13:52.920 --> 13:54.593
She was devastated.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.590
Tell me...

13:57.520 --> 13:59.079

14:00.880 --> 14:01.880

14:01.960 --> 14:04.429
PROSECUTION: Alistair was living

14:04.720 --> 14:06.757
and you never visited him once.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.517
Yet you stayed in Scotland and
visited in hospital

14:10.760 --> 14:13.036
the woman accused
of murdering your son.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.430

- Really?
- My hands are tied.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.640
DAVID: There's no way I can
risk my position by keeping you on.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.955
You're serious.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.954
I thought you of all people
would understand.

17:17.920 --> 17:21.675
Joanna and I are victims
of a horrific crime.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.151
I've lost my son
and months of my life

17:25.599 --> 17:27.796
and that makes me unsuitable
to work for the party?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.439
It was decided that your...

17:30.240 --> 17:32.675
notoriety would cloud the role.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.634
And how's your daughter?

17:36.920 --> 17:39.310
Alistair,
don't make this personal.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.595
But you still have your seat

17:41.040 --> 17:43.919
your job, because I managed
your family's crisis

17:44.080 --> 17:45.514
and many others before that.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.717
DAVID: Of course you're upset.
OK, OK.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.311
Perhaps I could call
Stuart Galwick.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.273
- Stuart who?
- Galwick.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.751
He may have something for you in

They're pretty.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.600
How was your day?

19:29.160 --> 19:30.160
Hard.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.320
Well, I lost my job.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.440
The party don't want me back.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.514
It's disgraceful.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.791
I just spent the afternoon
wandering about.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.552
People treat me
like the grieving mother.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.675
I just want to... disappear.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.794
I'll get you a glass of wine.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.954
Do you ever hear me?

20:19.120 --> 20:20.120
Yes.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.354
Yes, I hear you.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.480
I'm sorry you feel like that.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.720
I've just lost my job.

What are you doing here?

21:02.760 --> 21:04.399
Uh, the cleaner let me in.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.399
You don't respond to my calls
or texts anymore, so...

21:15.040 --> 21:16.190
It's been...

21:16.560 --> 21:17.560
It's been busy.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.754
Shh... should I go?

21:24.080 --> 21:25.080
No.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.794
Sorry, um...

21:31.280 --> 21:33.078
End of day, not myself.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.760
What is that supposed to be?

21:46.560 --> 21:47.560
Um...

21:49.040 --> 21:51.760
"The monster was only pretending
to be asleep."

21:53.280 --> 21:54.680
Jesus, it's terrifying.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.270
JOANNA LAUGHS.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.554
How are you?

22:03.520 --> 22:06.433
Yeah, good. You know, busy.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.518
You should come in
and get your hair cut.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.320
I've not had it cut
since I was away.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.958
You should have
made an appointment.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.076
Yeah.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.399
Yeah, maybe I could um...

22:20.920 --> 22:22.673
Maybe I could come over

22:24.080 --> 22:25.520
you know,
when nobody else is around.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.115
Of course.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.039
We could have some wine...

22:29.400 --> 22:30.595
Yeah.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.480
It's OK.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.075
Can you go?

22:59.960 --> 23:00.996
Jo.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.034
I'm fine, it's OK.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.476
I'll call you.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.720
I'll call you.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.599
I will, promise.

ALISTAIR LAUGHS

23:24.440 --> 23:27.956
ALISTAIR: The PR consultant says
that it's going to cost $1,000.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.038
- Uh-huh.
- And the guy says

23:30.240 --> 23:31.833
$1,000, that's expensive.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.270
And the PR con...

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
Jo.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.151
- Hi.
- Hi. Um...

23:38.080 --> 23:40.436
Jo, this is...
this is Jean Louise Talbot.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.715
- Hi.
- JOANNA: Ah...

23:41.800 --> 23:43.951
our mysterious publicist.
That's me.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.557
I'll just get you
a glass of wine.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.990
Joanna, I'm so sorry
for what you've been through.

23:49.960 --> 23:50.960
Thank you.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.116
Um, are we celebrating?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.950
Yeah. The book deal came through
today.

24:01.960 --> 24:02.960
Um...

24:03.320 --> 24:05.789
We've been commissioned
to write a book.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.360
Our story.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.755
Oh, why would we want
to do that?

24:12.760 --> 24:14.479
People are very interested
in both of you.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.394
It will sell.
I wish they weren't.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.880
I wish it would all
just go away.

24:17.960 --> 24:18.996
JEAN-LOUISE: Exactly.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.958
And you should make that
a part of the book.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.760
The intrusion of the press.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.077
Be brutally honest
about everything; Why not?

24:26.680 --> 24:30.435
And I might have a job.
If you want it, believe me

24:30.520 --> 24:31.840
- it's yours.
- It's... it's...

24:32.120 --> 24:34.635
It's an organisation called
Broken Circle.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.271
And it's, it's for parent's

24:37.640 --> 24:39.916
who have lost their children
to violent crimes

24:40.680 --> 24:42.478
and they want me to come
and work for them.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.077
JEAN-LOUISE: Broken Circle UK
are one of my clients.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.916
Alistair would be both
spokesperson for the foundation

24:50.000 --> 24:52.071
and manage their global press
and publicity.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.990
And Alistair's public position
would help keep

24:56.080 --> 24:57.719
the search for Noah
in the public eye.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.600
Well, that's... that's great.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.911
Sorry, everything's just
become...

25:06.720 --> 25:08.120
very strange to me.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.870
What we've become.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.360
JEAN-LOUISE: Of course.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.990
What you've been through.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.040
I can't even begin to imagine.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.720
There's a lot to take in.

25:18.360 --> 25:19.589
Why don't I go?

25:20.040 --> 25:21.520
Let you two talk about it.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.074
So then, I'll walk you out.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.440
It was really great to meet you.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.320

26:07.120 --> 26:08.120
It's um...

26:09.880 --> 26:12.475
It's... its a good package.
It's such a lie.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.550
How can you do it?

26:21.040 --> 26:24.158
I know this experience
from the inside.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.356
I thought... I thought
you'd be happy for m-

26:48.280 --> 26:51.159
It would be ideal if she would,
because you're seen as a team.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.709
You're both Noah's parents.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.553
You know how she feels
about this stuff.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.991
What if you sold it to her
as a one-off? Just a...

26:57.320 --> 26:59.551
good set of photos of
the two of you for the website?

26:59.640 --> 27:01.791
Or I could do it without her.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.160
Yes.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.360
You need to be aware

27:05.440 --> 27:07.955
that it's Joanna the public most
want to see and hear from.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.199
It's photos of her
that are the magnet.

You alone, not so much.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.115
Fallen mothers.

ALISTAIR: <i>Thank you for this.</i>

27:20.720 --> 27:21.870
It means a lot.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.230
Just stills, no interviews?
Absolutely.

I'd love a cup of tea.

It makes sense, we,
we had so much press there.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.031
Did Alistair tell you
he's writing a book?

30:59.240 --> 31:00.240
Will I be in it?

ALISTAIR: No. Not, not much.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.995

ALISTAIR: Yeah, I mean we'll
we'll let Alexandra

read anything before
it's published, of course.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.800
You know, there are people...

31:16.240 --> 31:17.720
still looking for Noah.

ALISTAIR: You, um...

you... you still read

Well, how else is anyone gonna
find him unless we keep trying?

31:43.520 --> 31:45.557
This is what you guys
should be doing

31:46.040 --> 31:49.795
not having your photos taken
like you're stupid celebrities.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.593
ELIZABETH: Chloe, that's enough.

call it a night.

PROSECUTION:
<i>Is it not the case that</i>

32:03.880 --> 32:07.112
Joanna Lyndsay
is a stranger to the truth?

32:08.920 --> 32:10.354
I don't know how to answer that.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.433
Well, the accused
is an adulteress who...

32:13.640 --> 32:16.360
destroyed your marriage
and left you a single mother.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.991
Her only child
apparently disappeared

32:19.080 --> 32:20.878
when she popped into the shops.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.558
Do you agree that she
has a history

32:24.640 --> 32:27.439
of covering up her own
questionable behaviours?

32:28.360 --> 32:30.511
I think there's a difference
between lying...

32:33.080 --> 32:35.151
and doing what you have to do,
to survive.

32:36.920 --> 32:38.718
I think Joanna was trapped.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.598
Alistair was not an easy man...

32:44.440 --> 32:45.440
to love.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.155
Sorry I'm late.

I wish they weren't here
tonight.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.630
I know.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.356
It's a tough day.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.640
But let's try and celebrate.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.236
Today?

33:43.080 --> 33:44.434
On Noah's birthday?

33:44.920 --> 33:45.920
Yes.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.589
Marry me.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.349
I want us to move forward.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.320
I want us to get Chloe

33:55.680 --> 33:57.592
to move over here, I wanna...

33:59.080 --> 34:00.673
I wanna have another baby

34:01.320 --> 34:02.356
maybe two.

Remember, we are invincible.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.400

34:13.600 --> 34:15.239
we can do anything.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.396
OK.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.795
Great.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.034
Let's tell Chloe tonight.

35:11.320 --> 35:12.879
ALISTAIR: Mum, what's going on?

35:13.560 --> 35:14.840
I had no idea, I've been asleep.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.840
CHLOE: I just bought some
balloons from the shop.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.999
The man gave me these streamers

35:19.240 --> 35:20.720
he said he was
throwing them out.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.040
Did you forget?

35:26.840 --> 35:28.433
You forgot it was his birthday?

35:31.120 --> 35:33.760
Chloe...
This is what he might look like now.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.756
Someone has made this,
it's amazing.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.313
I had no idea,
I am so sorry, Jo.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.238
- Nan!
- JOANNA: That's enough!

35:43.840 --> 35:45.433
How could you be so stupid?

35:47.040 --> 35:48.474
So insensitive?

35:50.720 --> 35:52.120
I can't do this.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.880
Jo, wait.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.993

35:56.080 --> 35:57.309
- Please.
- Wait.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.279
Oh, it's too horrible.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.837
Chloe will be devastated, OK.
She'll think you don't like her.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.434
- Well, I don't!
- Jesus, Jo.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.910
She's fifteen years old.
I don't want to be her mother!

36:07.840 --> 36:09.479
The damage is too much to repair

36:09.560 --> 36:12.632
and I don't want the responsibility
of failing another child.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.349
Mostly to you though.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.160
My God.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.959
I can shred it all if you want.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.440
No one expects you
to respond to it.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.680
No, I'd like to look through.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
People took the time.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.394
You have such heart

37:20.680 --> 37:22.114
and it appears so genuine.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.790
Effortless.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.239
You are
Alistair's greatest asset

37:26.600 --> 37:28.193
and about to become his wife,
I believe.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.360
Uh...

37:29.440 --> 37:30.440
Congrats.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.315
I'll leave you to it.

OK, hearts, hearts,

40:48.360 --> 40:49.360
But I'm winning.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.235
- No you're not.
- Yes, I am.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.074
I need some fresh air.

40:53.520 --> 40:54.840
We'll be back for dinner.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.070
Now, that's a good idea.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.437
Chloe, we can go
to the art gallery.

40:58.680 --> 40:59.796
CHLOE: Yeah, OK.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.793
Just don't touch the game.

OK, where are we going?

41:16.360 --> 41:17.476
I'm not sure.

41:18.640 --> 41:19.710
Out of the city?

41:20.600 --> 41:21.600
Sure.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.456
ALISTAIR: I was thinking
we should take Chloe down to London

42:04.480 --> 42:05.630
before she goes home.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.680
Get her excited about
living here.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.750
It'll take time.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.875
When we have another baby

42:17.960 --> 42:20.077
she'll want to be here,
for sure.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.120
I don't want another baby.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.475
You've got to forgive yourself.

42:56.720 --> 42:57.995
Let's drive.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.316
Alistair...

43:13.080 --> 43:14.594
I need to ask you something.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.477
Did you give Noah medicine
at the airport?

43:23.520 --> 43:24.636
What?

43:25.440 --> 43:26.794
At Melbourne Airport.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.600
I went to get us coffee

43:30.680 --> 43:32.876
you were at the car hire desk
with Noah.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.240
Did you give him medicine then?

43:46.480 --> 43:48.039
No. What are you talking about?

43:49.280 --> 43:50.396
Alistair.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.680
Tell me.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.240
Tell me the truth.

43:57.720 --> 43:58.720
Did you?

43:58.960 --> 44:00.440

44:17.960 --> 44:19.189
There you go.

44:25.920 --> 44:26.920
Yes.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.160
And did you taste it?

BABY CRIES

44:53.400 --> 44:54.400
No.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.230
It was you.

45:08.560 --> 45:09.960
All this time.

45:14.200 --> 45:16.476
All of this time,
you've let me believe it was me.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.075
Jo, the medicine.

45:33.240 --> 45:34.240
What?

45:37.160 --> 45:38.560
When we found him.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.120
I was delirious.

45:43.800 --> 45:47.430
I forgot that I gave him
the medicine at the airport.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.799
Well, you've remembered
before now?

45:54.600 --> 45:57.399
You could have told me,
millions of times.

45:58.760 --> 45:59.910
I wanted to tell you, Jo.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.319
Look, I've had to
live with it too.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.200
You're a coward.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.119
I had to bury him.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.354
I had to dig a hole

46:33.800 --> 46:36.315
and put my son's body in it,
he was dead.

46:37.840 --> 46:40.560
He was gone: Who did it,
where he was buried

46:40.640 --> 46:42.871
I mean, what did it matter?
Where he was buried?

46:43.400 --> 46:45.312
What do you mean,
where he was buried?

46:45.480 --> 46:47.676
You took me there, you showed me
where he was buried.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.116
Oh my God!

46:59.800 --> 47:02.190
You lied about that too.
Yes, because I had to!

47:02.280 --> 47:04.078
The cops were tracking
our every move!

47:04.400 --> 47:05.675
They never followed us there.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.793
Yes. Yes, they did
and they found nothing.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.040
He's not buried under the tree.

47:12.360 --> 47:13.874
I drove you to a fake spot.

47:14.160 --> 47:15.992
The cops tracked us there,
they dug it up

47:16.160 --> 47:17.640
and they found nothing.
It helped us.

47:18.240 --> 47:20.072
It took the heat off us.
I did that!

but whether or not
you're fit to stand trial.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.118
Well, we both know
I'm fit to stand trial.

50:40.280 --> 50:41.600

50:44.440 --> 50:45.440

50:46.880 --> 50:48.439

Noah, together.

50:55.720 --> 50:58.599
Quietly sharing our

51:03.560 --> 51:06.792

51:07.680 --> 51:09.000
a second

51:25.520 --> 51:26.520
I lived.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.560
So I could tell the truth.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.318
My Lord, I'd like to request
an adjournment.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.073
I don't want that,
I want to continue.

Where is my little boy?

52:57.960 --> 52:59.838
Whoever took my son from me

53:03.200 --> 53:05.271
made me think I had failed
to protect him.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.717
Made me think
I was a bad mother.
