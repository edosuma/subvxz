Help!

00:37.287 --> 00:38.956
Help!

00:39.164 --> 00:40.832
Help me!

01:22.874 --> 01:24.293
Michael briskett.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.836
I'm never gonna
forget that name.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.671
That is my favorite cut of meat.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.799
Mr. robillard. Wow. Um...
Merry Christmas.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.848
L just finished the branch
Compton assessments,

01:32.968 --> 01:34.886
and I was going to bring them to you.
Really?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.222
I stayed up all night, but
I figured you wanted 'em.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.684
You actually finished
them that quickly?

01:40.892 --> 01:42.853
That is amazing.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.540
I really do like it here, sir. I
wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.357
Actually, I'm having
a Christmas party

01:47.566 --> 01:48.817
at my apartment tomorrow night.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.944
Okay. Good for you.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.864
Yeah, it's nothing big.
Just eggnog, secret Santa,

01:54.072 --> 01:56.283
Christmas Carols, maybe.
I don't know.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.595
But this is the invitation.
I've been passing it around.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.079
Oh, yeah. Can't do that.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.498
I got this big Christmas
dinner thingy.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.376
If you find yourself
in the neighborhood.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.049
I got big plans for
you, briskett.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.259
Me?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.446
You're gonna do my breakdowns
for my meeting on the 26th

02:16.470 --> 02:17.846
with quantum dynamics.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.141
The day after Christmas.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.893
I'm gonna need spreadsheets.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.394
Side-by-side transitions.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.229
Zero bilateral.
Alphabetical listing.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.166
You know what to do...
Just turn the geek speak

02:28.190 --> 02:30.025
into people speak.

02:30.233 --> 02:34.196
This is very important for me
and the future of this company.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.366
That's a lot of work in
a short amount of time,

02:37.574 --> 02:38.700
and with the holidays...

02:38.909 --> 02:39.951
You'll get it done.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.120
I'm sure of that.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.708
Wait here. I will have the
reports brought down to you.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.254
I need them done by Christmas.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.301
Christmas.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.141
Hey, Catherine.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.602
Which reindeer has
the worst manners?

03:05.811 --> 03:08.021
I don't fucking care.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.731
<i>“Rude-mph .“</i>

03:09.940 --> 03:11.817
Rudolph, the red-nosed
reindeer, get it?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.194
Yeah, it's stupid.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.571
Where's your Christmas joy?

03:16.780 --> 03:20.325
I don't do joy, and I
don't do Christmas.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.744
Well... merry Christmas.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.246
Fuck all!

03:24.454 --> 03:26.123
Good enough.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.813
That didn't go down so good.

03:31.837 --> 03:32.837
You know...

03:32.963 --> 03:34.131
I'm gonna puke.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.632
No! Get to the bathroom.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.175
No, you're not. Not in here.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.052
Get to the bathroom, right now.

03:39.261 --> 03:42.848
Wait. I'm okay. I'm
gonna be fine.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.017
No!

03:58.280 --> 03:59.656
<i>With one brush.</i>

03:59.865 --> 04:01.199
<i>Watch as luster brush</i>

04:01.408 --> 04:02.951
<i>fits into tiny crevices,</i>

04:03.160 --> 04:05.078
<i>under sinks, counters...</i>

04:23.346 --> 04:25.366
Tickets, tickets! I got tickets
for you right here, man.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.909
Come on, come on, two
for ten, two for ten.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.769
Take your girl out
to a game, man.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.830
She'll enjoy it. Come on. I got
tickets for you right here.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.689
Come on, two for $10.
Two for ten.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.251
You sure you don't want it? It's
the last game of the season.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.502
Don't do me like that. I'll
give it to you for five.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.903
Come on, man, unfair.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.237
Fuck!

04:48.497 --> 04:50.123
Hey! Still got tickets?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.542
Heck, yeah, I got tickets.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.241
Are you Michael briskett?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.871
Are you Michael briskett?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.541
I'm Cindy, Mr. robillard's
new assistant.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.918
Here's the reports he
wanted you to have.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.130
Uh... thank you?

05:40.465 --> 05:42.717
And these.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.887
Looks like a lot of work.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.639
Yeah.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.774
Merry Christmas.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.237
Merry Christmas.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.015
Hello?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.309
Am I too late to the
Christmas party?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.144
Is it over?

06:35.812 --> 06:36.812
Yes.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.231
Ohh.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.942
No, no. I mean... I mean, no.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.152
Great.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.654
So...

06:44.863 --> 06:46.072
So...

06:46.281 --> 06:48.617
So, can I come in?

06:48.825 --> 06:51.036
Yes. Yes, of course. Sorry.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.789
I saw the invitation on Mr.
robillard's desk.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.168
I'm sorry. I thought
everyone was invited.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.502
Yeah, they were.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.338
Sorry it's not much of a party.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.048
Is that eggrwg?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.216
I love eggflog-

07:05.425 --> 07:07.844
really? I'll pour you a glass.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.053
Thanks.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.221
Okay.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.271
Mmm!

07:18.480 --> 07:19.856
This is so good.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.067
My mom used to make
eggnog from scratch.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.736
Really? That's-that's amazing.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.162
So, are you-you going
home for Christmas?

07:34.371 --> 07:37.374
No, my-my mom goes on a cruise.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.042
Oh.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.419
Kind of a gift to
herself, uh, every year.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.172
She's not really big
on-on the holidays.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.174
Uh, but we talk on the phone,

07:46.383 --> 07:49.761
you know, when-when she gets back.
So...

07:51.054 --> 07:52.681
Brothers? Sisters?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.975
Just me and mom.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.900
L-i think family is the
best part of the holidays.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.403
I'm actually headed home
tomorrow to see mine.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.446
That's nice.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.248
Refill?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.378
Do you mind if we...

08:23.586 --> 08:25.088
Kick it up a bit?

08:25.296 --> 08:28.341
I'

08:33.513 --> 08:34.597
Okay.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.351
White Christmas.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.520
No way. That's my favorite too!

08:41.730 --> 08:43.063
Really?

08:43.273 --> 08:44.753
We watch it every
year after presents.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.360
My brother hates it,
but I love it, so...

08:47.569 --> 08:51.072
Speaking of presents,
let's do secret Santa!

08:51.281 --> 08:53.908
Uh... won't-won't be
much of a secret.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.369
Ah, who cares? Come
on, it'll be fun.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.370
Come on.

08:57.579 --> 08:58.579
Yeah, why not.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.921
You go first.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.139
I wanted to get
something practical.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.767
Thank you.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.603
You know, I can use this.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.854
Your turn.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.238
Open it.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.285
It's my mother's special
Christmas cookie mix.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.412
I'm going to make them
from scratch this year.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.039
Wow.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.583
Yeah, sort of a holiday
treat for my family,

09:43.792 --> 09:46.336
since, uh, she passed away.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.799
I'm-I'm sorry.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.263
It's my first Christmas
without her.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.102
What am I doing? I'm
ruining the party!

10:02.268 --> 10:03.269
No. No, no, no, no.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.230
Um, it's-it's okay.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.691
Uh, can-can I get you
some more eggnog?

10:10.193 --> 10:11.861
You know, um, I'd
better get going.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.280
Actually, I'm feeling
a little tipsy.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.244
I really did have a
wonderful time tonight.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.246
Me too.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.497
Thank you.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.046
Okay.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.381
Okay, then.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.467
Merry Christmas.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.053
Merry Christmas to you.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.471
See ya. Bye.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.633
I know this might sound
crazy, but I was wondering...

10:57.657 --> 10:59.993
Maybe you could come
with me tomorrow?

11:00.201 --> 11:03.496
To your family's Christmas?

11:03.705 --> 11:05.373
I don't know.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.393
It would tear me up to
think that a guy like you

11:07.417 --> 11:11.087
didn't make it to a
Christmas dinner table.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.297
What about your family?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.923
They'd love to have you.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.886
I have a ton of work
to finish by the 26th.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.512
I'd have to bring it with me.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.014
For sure, you'd have to.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.557
Come on, it'll be fun.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.726
Plus, my family goes
all-out on the food.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.979
I never really had a big
Christmas celebration before.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.106
Well, this year will be special.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.691
I'll pick you up in the morning?

11:33.484 --> 11:34.944
Sure, why not.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.321
Ten-thirty.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.323
Ten-thirty. Okay.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.325
Merry Christmas.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.806
Hey, get in here.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.603
Work.

12:08.811 --> 12:12.357
Trying to remember
from last night...

12:12.565 --> 12:16.152
Your brother's names are
Andrew and Bart, right?

12:16.361 --> 12:19.155
Yep. Dad is Abe, grandma's Ruth.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.698
Right. I call her granny.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.868
Are you sure I'm not imposing?

12:24.077 --> 12:26.663
I told you, they'd
love to have you.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.252
Andrew, Bart, Abe, granny.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.381
Hey, what's your
favorite Christmas song?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.591
"The 12 days of Christmas."

12:38.800 --> 12:41.052
<i>Are you serious'? Me too! Yeah'?</i>

12:41.261 --> 12:42.512
Of course!

12:42.720 --> 12:45.682
I'

13:06.077 --> 13:09.998
We're here.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.292
Looks great.

13:21.676 --> 13:22.676
I'm home!

13:22.844 --> 13:23.844
Daddy!

13:24.012 --> 13:25.430
Oh, monkey!

13:25.638 --> 13:27.807
Oh, I have missed you
so much, honey bug.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.016
So good to see you.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.268
Sister slim!

13:30.476 --> 13:33.563
Barty boy!

13:33.771 --> 13:36.065
Cindy darling.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.610
Philip. I didn't
know you'd be here.

13:39.819 --> 13:45.074
Your dad invited me to
dinner, just like old times.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.492
Welcome home, beautiful.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.453
Everyone, this is Michael.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.021
I invited him for
Christmas dinner.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.332
Oh, great.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.500
Hello.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.878
We'll be glad to have you.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.588
Thank you.

13:58.796 --> 14:03.009
Cindy, precious, you're
just in time for lunch.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.677
Who the hell are you?

14:27.033 --> 14:29.494
Perfect family,

14:29.702 --> 14:31.662
meet Michael briskett.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.250
Lunch is ready.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.044
You startled me there.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.213
I did? Yeah.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.508
All looks so good.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.094
Cindy, I was just
saying that Philip

14:46.302 --> 14:48.054
is now my associate professor

14:48.262 --> 14:50.181
in the human
sciences department.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.076
Why don't you stay for
new year's this year?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.685
We can hit our favorite
haunts, paint the town.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.313
You and I don't have any
old haunts, Philip.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.982
We used to date. No, we didn't.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.235
These people took me in.
I'm a part of the family.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.694
Not really.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.531
At the least, I'm a good friend.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.451
You will always have a
seat at our table, Philip.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.245
Hey, let's eat!

15:12.453 --> 15:14.205
Bon appétit!

15:15.331 --> 15:17.583
Ooh, I love ribs!

15:17.792 --> 15:21.003
I'

15:42.525 --> 15:44.360
I can't eat another bite.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.821
Michael, I hear
you're an eggnog man.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.115
You bet I am.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.658
Well, good.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.161
Then, may I propose a toast...

15:53.369 --> 15:55.997
To, uh, home cooking.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.498
Merry Christmas, everybody.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.042
Merry Christmas.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.003
Can I?

16:03.045 --> 16:05.298
Uh, sure.

16:08.217 --> 16:12.388
I can't say I ever had
a real Christmas,

16:12.597 --> 16:16.809
but thanks to Cindy and you all,

16:17.018 --> 16:18.378
I finally get a
chance to celebrate

16:18.436 --> 16:21.189
in a way I'd always hoped...

16:21.397 --> 16:26.194
With great people and good food.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.653
To the holidays.

16:34.035 --> 16:37.622
Nice speech, briskett.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.042
Little corny, but I
like your sentiment.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.710
Bart, good, man,
good to see you.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.546
Did you leave any food for me?
Doubt it.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.435
Granny, how are you?
Good to see you, Andy.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.800
Nice to see you. Andrew, my boy.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.387
You know him? Philip. Sis.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.014
Glad you could make it.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.516
Mr. robillard?

16:56.724 --> 16:57.975
Yes. Yes. Yes.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.185
Huh?

17:00.895 --> 17:01.895
Sister?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.189
Mm-hmm.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.858
How do you like my
family, briskett?

17:07.068 --> 17:10.363
They're nice.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.540
Help!

18:02.748 --> 18:05.001
Help me!

18:05.209 --> 18:06.502
Help!

18:06.711 --> 18:08.296
Shut the fuck up!
Nobody can hear you!

18:08.504 --> 18:09.839
Oh, god, oh, god!

18:11.215 --> 18:13.134
Jesus god, the pain!

18:13.342 --> 18:14.802
Aaahhh!

18:15.011 --> 18:16.697
Hey! Screaming like a
bitch isn't gonna help.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.431
Believe me, I've been trying.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.639
What is going on?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.350
I don't fucking know.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.020
Shh. Be quiet.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.980
Oh, Jesus!

18:26.188 --> 18:27.648
The pain is killing me!

18:27.857 --> 18:28.899
Shh.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.318
Shut the fuck up, old man.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.737
I'm pissing my pants. Shh!

18:32.945 --> 18:35.072
Shut up. Shut up!

18:42.913 --> 18:43.998
What is that?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.507
What the fuck?!

19:10.733 --> 19:11.901
Ban?!

19:12.109 --> 19:14.236
Do you know this motherfucker?

19:14.445 --> 19:16.155
How do you know his name? Hey!

19:16.364 --> 19:17.573
Do you have my medicine?

19:17.782 --> 19:19.992
Oh, Jesus, no.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.286
Hey, put it down. He's old.
Just let him go.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.829
Hurts so bad!

19:24.038 --> 19:25.289
No, Bart!

19:25.498 --> 19:27.333
Where are you going?
No, no, no, no!

19:28.751 --> 19:30.127
Oh, my god!

19:30.336 --> 19:31.712
Oh, no!

19:31.921 --> 19:33.321
Mister, what the
fuck are you doing?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.097
Oh, shit!

19:41.305 --> 19:43.557
Jesus Christ, what
just happened?

19:43.766 --> 19:44.766
Aah!

19:44.934 --> 19:46.018
Mr. robillard?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.436
I need you to come with me.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.855
No, no, no! Mr. robillard!

19:58.197 --> 19:59.198
Mr. robillard.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.491
L-i don't understand.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.992
Briskett, shut up.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.204
We have a bit of a dilemma here.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.747
We have Christmas dinner,

20:06.956 --> 20:09.041
which you're
obviously a part of,

20:09.250 --> 20:11.293
and then I still
need my breakdowns

20:11.502 --> 20:13.045
for my meeting with
quantum dynamics

20:13.254 --> 20:15.423
in two days.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.842
Hey, Andrew, the game is on.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.635
All right, pop, in a minute.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.137
All righty, then, but hurry...

20:21.345 --> 20:23.389
Almost the end of
the first half.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.226
Where was I?

20:29.478 --> 20:32.481
So, you're gonna do those reports
for me by Christmas, tomorrow.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.411
I mean, shit, briskett,
it's what you're good at.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.205
Sitting at your desk,

20:48.414 --> 20:50.624
focusing on silly
little numbers,

20:50.833 --> 20:52.126
is your specialty.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.557
Yes or no?

21:08.976 --> 21:10.060
Look at me.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.064
Yes or no?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.273
Yeah?

21:15.357 --> 21:17.276
Yes?

21:17.485 --> 21:19.236
Good. Move up.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.489
Get up.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.660
Now, I understand that
it's a short timeline.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.621
Conditions are not ideal.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.626
But I have a way
to help you focus.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.485
So, what do you think?

22:02.404 --> 22:04.031
Motivated?

22:23.717 --> 22:25.719
It's a beautiful table, huh?

22:27.263 --> 22:28.889
What are you, a righty? Lefty?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.270
(Right)!-.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.021
Okay.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.233
Now.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.988
If you need anything at all,

22:44.196 --> 22:45.781
I will be close by.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.465
You still have your
season tickets, Andrew?

23:03.674 --> 23:05.050
Nah. I gave 'em up.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.219
Got too busy. This
job is a killer.

23:07.428 --> 23:09.221
Mnh. Perils of the
gilded life, Andy.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.910
You know what Oscar
wilde once said...

23:11.015 --> 23:12.266
Shut up, Philip.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.601
Really?

23:13.809 --> 23:16.312
Michael, i don't hear any work.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.233
Yes. Five for five
from the line.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.336
I knew that guy could shoot,
I'll tell you that right now.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.446
Pop, you should
come to the city.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.382
I'll buy you a nice dinner, we'll get
some great seats. How about that?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.575
Yeah! All right, let's do it.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.077
What's the score? Uh, second
quarter, we're up by three.

23:32.286 --> 23:35.456
Briskett, i do not
have all year!

23:37.041 --> 23:38.709
Important work, son?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.628
I have a meeting in two days.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.772
It's a good chance to take my
company to the next level.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.173
Ahh.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.800
Looking sharp, granny.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.010
Turn that TV off.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.054
Mother, the game is on.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.265
I don't care if Johnny
Carson is at the door,

23:53.474 --> 23:54.934
it's time to go to church.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.769
Couldn't we skip it this year?

23:56.977 --> 23:59.939
Put those giblets in the icebox.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.440
Granny, come on. Really.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.150
Very important stuff
going on here.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.070
Church doesn't exactly fit
in the timeline, okay?

24:06.278 --> 24:10.324
Andy, the good lord doesn't give
a crap about your timeline.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.664
My god, Cindy, it's
just a church service.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.333
It's the only day i get
to dress up, okay?

24:19.541 --> 24:21.001
I think you look
amazing, darling.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.544
Don't call me darling.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.672
Well, boys,

24:24.880 --> 24:26.215
I think it's official...

24:26.423 --> 24:27.716
Two beautiful
ladies have decided

24:27.925 --> 24:29.718
we won't be watching the game,

24:29.927 --> 24:32.304
and frankly, I don't want
to fight a losing battle.

24:32.513 --> 24:35.057
Granny, is that fur?

24:35.265 --> 24:36.433
Yes.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.102
Take that off!

24:38.310 --> 24:39.871
Granny, the places where
they make those coats

24:39.895 --> 24:40.895
are slaughterhouses.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.231
They're inhumane!

24:42.439 --> 24:44.858
My land, i didn't know that.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.568
It's horrible.

24:50.406 --> 24:53.075
I don't believe it.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.122
I could kill somebody.

24:58.330 --> 25:02.292
I just set the table
not 30 minutes ago.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.714
Oh, yeah. That might
have been my bad.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.133
I nicked my finger peeling
apples for granny.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.135
Are you okay? I'm fine.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.137
Oh, well, no problem.
Just a drop.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.514
I'll wash the tablecloth
after dinner.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.325
Hey, listen, we'd better
hop on our giddyup

25:17.349 --> 25:18.827
if we're gonna make
that 4:00 service,

25:18.851 --> 25:20.352
I'm telling you right now.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.121
Okay, well, I don't
think i can make it.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.607
And you are going to church!
Fuck.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.155
Help! Help me!

25:31.363 --> 25:33.574
Please, somebody help!
Hey, shut the fuck up!

25:33.782 --> 25:35.051
You don't think we've been
screaming our guts out?

25:35.075 --> 25:36.368
Nobody can hear us down here.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.370
So, who the fuck are you?

25:38.579 --> 25:40.080
My name is Michael.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.750
I work in the data
assessment department.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.501
What am I doing here?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.354
Michael, we have to
find a way out of here.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.671
Now, what do you know?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.548
I don't know.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.426
I got brought here
this morning by Cindy.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.261
Who the hell is Cindy? The girl.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.430
The-the daughter in the family.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.491
You're telling me there's a whole
family of these motherfuckers?

25:58.515 --> 26:01.810
Of course! How did you get here?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.937
This motherfucker
clocked me in the head.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.957
If I'd have seen him coming, it'd
be a different fucking story.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.524
They grabbed me in my bar.

26:07.733 --> 26:12.029
Just... They killed my friend.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.491
So, how many of them are there?

26:15.699 --> 26:18.118
None. They all went to church.

26:18.327 --> 26:22.331
They went to church?!

26:22.539 --> 26:24.291
All right, look,

26:24.500 --> 26:27.002
somebody's got to be looking
for at least one of us, right?

26:27.211 --> 26:29.838
I mean, you got friends that'll
miss you and shit, right, tubby?

26:32.966 --> 26:34.843
Fuck. You?

26:35.052 --> 26:36.220
Doubt it.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.430
Damn, nobody? No, no one. You?

26:38.639 --> 26:40.516
Of course somebody's
looking for me.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.607
Ain't nobody looking for me.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.151
Ah, fuck!

26:54.863 --> 26:56.323
Please, somebody, help!

26:56.532 --> 26:57.699
Help! Help! Help us, please!

27:00.369 --> 27:01.787
Please help me!

27:01.995 --> 27:03.914
Help! Come on!

27:08.252 --> 27:09.294
Shut up!

27:09.503 --> 27:10.838
Shut up! Shut up!

27:11.046 --> 27:12.286
What the fuck's wrong with you?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.716
Can't you see? We are fucked.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.719
Bullshit. I ain't
a fuckin' animal.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.638
Aah! Fuck!

27:19.847 --> 27:22.891
How the fuck do we
get out of here?

27:24.393 --> 27:25.894
Mike! Yes?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.497
What's the upstairs like?
It's pretty nice.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.856
It's all done up
for the holidays.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.542
I didn't ask for a
travel report, bitch.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.067
Are there windows?
What about doors?

27:32.276 --> 27:33.610
If we can make it upstairs,

27:33.819 --> 27:35.237
can we get the fuck out of here?

27:35.445 --> 27:38.532
Probably, yes.
It's just a house.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.284
Okay. Cool.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.785
Let's get going.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.245
How long until church is over?

27:43.453 --> 27:44.872
Do you know something
i don't know?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.720
Because I am chained
to the fucking floor.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.671
Well, i guess church is over.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.635
I hate fucking Christmas.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.944
Shit!

28:16.153 --> 28:17.946
."Heinbounds for a pass

28:18.155 --> 28:19.531
with four seconds left.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.325
A bounce off the glass,

28:21.533 --> 28:23.535
two points, but he was fouled,

28:23.744 --> 28:26.424
so there was a chance to tie it up
at the line and go into overtime.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.165
How do you know that?

28:28.373 --> 28:30.918
Well, when I used the men's
room during the sermon,

28:31.126 --> 28:33.253
I snuck out to the car and
caught the end of the game.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.546
No way!

28:34.755 --> 28:36.131
Yeah, I perfected that trick

28:36.340 --> 28:38.008
when your mother
was still with us.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.569
I'm gonna have to steal that.
So what happened?

28:39.593 --> 28:40.719
He missed it.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.429
No, he didn't. Yep.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.157
Mom must have known you
were watching the games.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.599
Probably.

28:45.807 --> 28:48.644
But god love your mom,
she never said a word.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.020
I bet she was a bitch.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.272
What did you just say?

28:52.481 --> 28:53.565
Oh, shit.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.108
You heard me, motherfucker!

28:55.317 --> 28:56.526
Fuck you! Fuck both of you!

28:56.735 --> 28:58.570
Fuck your little
freakshow family!

28:58.779 --> 29:00.459
Get your hands off me!
Get the fuck off me!

29:00.489 --> 29:02.574
He's a live one! Boy,
I'll tell you that!

29:04.368 --> 29:06.119
Untie me!

29:06.328 --> 29:07.746
Untie me, motherfucker!

29:07.955 --> 29:09.456
Untie me and fight
me like a man!

29:09.665 --> 29:11.500
Fight like a man, you pussy!
Fuck you!

29:11.708 --> 29:12.868
You'd better fucking kill me!

29:14.795 --> 29:17.422
You'd better fucking kill me!

29:24.388 --> 29:26.848
Ooh! That's quite enough
of that chatterbox!

29:29.059 --> 29:30.995
So, what are the ladies
saying they need this year?

29:31.019 --> 29:34.731
They mentioned legs to me a
bit earlier, and, uh... oh!

29:34.940 --> 29:38.026
Last Sunday, granny was
talking about teaching Cindy

29:38.235 --> 29:40.195
her sweet pineapple marinade.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.822
Ooh, that'd be great. Yeah.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.366
Legs it is. All right!

29:58.422 --> 29:59.840
Whoa. Hang on a second.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.591
Hang on a second. Here you go.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.926
Thanks, pop. Uh-huh.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.472
Look, the one thing you
have to understand

30:07.681 --> 30:10.767
about basketball
is the free throw,

30:10.976 --> 30:13.520
I mean, the key element
for winning games.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.063
What about rebounds?

30:17.316 --> 30:18.692
Maybe they need a big man.

30:25.949 --> 30:26.992
Tough cut.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.660
Good bones.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.537
Yeah, looked that way.

30:30.746 --> 30:31.997
Ow.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.957
All right, excuse
me just a second.

30:39.963 --> 30:40.964
Michael.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.224
Why are you doing this to us?

30:56.563 --> 30:57.898
Focus, briskett.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.691
Take a bite.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.699
You do have a gift for numbers.

31:07.908 --> 31:09.268
Philip, what are
you doing in here?

31:09.451 --> 31:10.911
Hey, you need any
help with that?

31:11.119 --> 31:12.537
I'm working.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.706
Can-can you go in
the other room?

31:14.915 --> 31:16.500
Cindy's trying.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.877
She is, she's trying, but...

31:20.670 --> 31:21.922
It's not like it used to be,

31:22.130 --> 31:23.882
when mom was here.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.551
We'd all be in the
same room right now,

31:26.760 --> 31:28.720
playing charades or some crap.

31:31.473 --> 31:34.976
Food'd be done, and...

31:35.185 --> 31:38.313
Mom would be walking around
with a plate of cookies,

31:38.522 --> 31:41.650
and... she'd be laughing, and...

32:01.711 --> 32:04.214
- You sure look great.
- Don't touch me!

32:04.423 --> 32:06.633
You sure you don't want
to give it another shot?

32:06.842 --> 32:07.968
Don't go anywhere.

32:08.176 --> 32:09.636
Oh, my god!

32:09.845 --> 32:12.264
I never was, and won't
ever be, Philip.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.141
You think you could go watch TV

32:14.349 --> 32:15.934
or read a magazine or something?

32:16.143 --> 32:18.520
I was just trying to help.
You're just in my way.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.773
Fine. If that's how
you want it to be.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.067
You know, Ralph Waldo
Emerson once said,

32:24.276 --> 32:25.819
"for every minute you're angry,

32:26.027 --> 32:27.737
you lose 60 seconds
of happiness."

32:27.946 --> 32:29.489
I could give a shit, Philip.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.015
I'll tell you right now, nothing's
going to ruin the first Christmas

32:38.039 --> 32:40.059
I've put together myself,
I'll tell you that right now.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.460
Cindy, untie me, please.

32:41.668 --> 32:42.961
Let me go.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.671
Come on, it's stocking time!

32:44.880 --> 32:47.549
Let's not piss on the
winds of tradition.

32:47.757 --> 32:50.135
Cindy, you can't be
like your family.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.597
Not you. Not the girl
i met last night.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.108
I don't believe it. You
don't have it in you.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.186
See, I'd argue it's
all about the glass.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.914
Rebounds win games. No, no, you've
got to find a perimeter shooter.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.815
Get those legs in the kitchen!

33:04.024 --> 33:05.585
So behind. I've got to
get 'em in the roaster.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.249
Dinner's not gonna be
ready any time soon.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.279
Tell me it's not who you
are, Cindy, please.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.198
Boys, it's stocking time!

33:11.406 --> 33:13.909
Oh, stockings! Great.
I'll get the camera.

33:14.117 --> 33:18.622
Uh, the fork goes
on the right side,

33:18.830 --> 33:21.666
next to the spoon.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.585
Left side.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.547
Thank you.

33:29.633 --> 33:30.633
Left side.

33:30.759 --> 33:31.801
Andy!

33:32.010 --> 33:33.053
Granny and her stockings.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.554
Put 'em up, take 'em down.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.306
Put 'em up, take 'em down.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.641
Family tradition!

33:37.849 --> 33:39.184
Henry Ford always said,

33:39.392 --> 33:40.894
"the only history
that's worth a damn

33:41.102 --> 33:42.747
is the traditions you
make with your family."

33:42.771 --> 33:44.571
You're not even a part
of this family, Philip.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.900
But it's a beautiful thing
to witness the customs

33:47.108 --> 33:49.027
of another tribe, so to speak.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.321
Tribe? What the hell are
you talking about, Philip?

33:53.532 --> 33:54.699
I've said it before,

33:54.908 --> 33:56.660
but I can't stop
saying it again.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.038
It is so nice to have you
three kids together again

34:00.247 --> 34:01.706
under this roof.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.458
Christmas is my
favorite time of year.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.876
Oh, daddy.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.753
Now stockings!

34:06.962 --> 34:08.295
Cindy, you first.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.925
Oh, crap. Give me some scissors.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.510
Oh, I got it. Okay.

34:16.972 --> 34:17.973
There.

34:19.683 --> 34:22.018
I'm really happy that
we're all together again.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.147
Love you, mom.

34:26.356 --> 34:28.440
God rest her.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.068
She's up there somewhere,

34:30.277 --> 34:32.904
looking down at us right now.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.614
I can guarantee that. "Family.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.701
"That dear octopus
from whose tentacles

34:37.909 --> 34:39.536
"we never quite escape,

34:39.744 --> 34:42.871
nor, in our innermost hearts,
ever quite wish to."

34:43.081 --> 34:45.166
What the hell are
you talking about?

34:45.375 --> 34:48.795
Cindy, have you decided
on a dessert yet?

34:49.004 --> 34:50.004
Dessert?

34:50.088 --> 34:51.755
Ohh! Not good!

34:51.965 --> 34:53.882
You gotta start that early,
or you'll get behind

34:54.092 --> 34:55.844
like you did with them legs.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.263
Granny, I'm-I'm trying, okay.
There's a lot to do.

34:58.471 --> 35:01.600
We should be eating soon, and you haven't
even got those legs in the oven yet.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.393
All right, granny, please!

35:03.602 --> 35:05.895
It's a bad thing to
leave a family hungry!

35:06.104 --> 35:07.939
I know. Like Nelson said,

35:08.148 --> 35:09.458
"food is the fuel that
drives a family to..."

35:09.482 --> 35:11.610
oh, Philip, goddamn it!

35:11.818 --> 35:14.487
Shut the fuck up!

35:14.696 --> 35:16.990
Shut the fuck up,

35:17.198 --> 35:19.117
you son of a bitch!

35:19.326 --> 35:23.371
Fuck you!

35:39.929 --> 35:42.140
I'm sorry I yelled
at you, granny...

35:42.349 --> 35:43.975
Oh, it's all right, honey.

35:44.184 --> 35:48.146
I'm sorry too. You've got
a lot on your plate.

35:48.355 --> 35:52.150
I have an idea.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.986
What about mincemeat pie
for dessert tomorrow?

35:55.195 --> 35:57.697
That'd be good, right?
We can use Philip.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.574
- That'd hit the spot.
- Yeah.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.452
I could try that. Yeah.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.454
Yes, of course you can, honey.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.081
It'd be wonderful.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.166
Listen, Abe, let's finish
up these stockings

36:08.375 --> 36:10.543
and give Cindy some time
to finish her work.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.004
All righty, then.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.340
What do you think is
going on down there?

36:17.467 --> 36:18.551
<i>Brisket“!</i>

36:18.760 --> 36:20.970
Help! I've been kidnapped!

36:21.179 --> 36:22.597
My name's Michael briskett!

36:22.806 --> 36:25.016
I'm being held prisoner!

36:25.225 --> 36:26.685
Help! Help!

36:30.897 --> 36:32.148
Hello, officer.

36:33.775 --> 36:35.026
You must be Andrew.

36:35.235 --> 36:36.695
I recognize you
from your picture.

36:36.903 --> 36:40.198
You do? Which one?

36:40.407 --> 36:41.950
Hi!

36:42.158 --> 36:43.535
Hey, baby.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.496
You two know each other?

36:46.705 --> 36:48.915
Andy, this is Denise,
my girlfriend.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.209
She'll be having dinner
with us tonight.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.627
She'll be eating with us?

36:52.836 --> 36:54.754
That's what I'm saying.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.214
What?!

36:56.423 --> 36:57.841
She's a cop.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.467
Yeah. I know.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.178
Dispatcher, actually.
Not really an officer.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.306
Andy, I've heard
so much about you.

37:05.515 --> 37:06.891
Yeah.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.435
Can't say the same.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.103
Yeah. Get in here.

37:14.691 --> 37:15.900
This is Michael.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.320
He's Christmas dinner.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.056
A beef steak. That's the best
cut you'll find on a grown man.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.328
Big fat boy like this...
Right here.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.790
That's the t-bone, tenderloin,

37:30.999 --> 37:32.584
and right up here, the ribeye.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.422
Come around under the pits.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.966
That's the brisket.
A family favorite.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.595
Gotta keep him alive
as long as possible.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.346
Brush is best.

37:45.555 --> 37:47.475
Doesn't mean we can't
tenderize him a little bit.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.067
You fucking bastard!

37:58.276 --> 38:00.695
Aw, shit!

38:00.904 --> 38:02.739
Don't you touch him!

38:02.947 --> 38:04.783
That is my man, you bitch!

38:07.827 --> 38:09.746
I will kill you!

38:09.954 --> 38:11.706
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, honey.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.900
We don't want to
ruin the groceries.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.508
I'm sorry, baby.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.011
Please, please.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.305
How's your leg?

38:27.514 --> 38:28.515
Mosquito bite.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.350
Hey, I need to help pop.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.143
You want to watch?

38:33.269 --> 38:34.729
No, it's okay.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.272
I think I'll just, uh,

38:36.481 --> 38:39.192
go up and see if
Cindy needs help.

38:41.528 --> 38:42.528
Hey.

38:44.739 --> 38:45.824
I love you.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.911
Love you too.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.882
Oh, shit.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.260
He's still alive?

39:05.468 --> 39:07.303
I'll be damned!

39:15.937 --> 39:18.189
Okay, boys. Here's the question:

39:18.398 --> 39:20.775
Where do you suppose
mincemeat comes from?

39:20.984 --> 39:23.570
I'm guessing the
shoulder blades.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.114
How long have you even been
together with this chick?

39:26.322 --> 39:27.448
Name's Denise.

39:27.657 --> 39:28.908
It's been a couple of months.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.910
Ah-ha ha. Says here,

39:31.119 --> 39:34.581
"sweet mincemeat
pie comes from..."

39:34.789 --> 39:38.459
uh, behind the haystack,
just below the exit.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.044
The poop shoot? The colon.

39:40.253 --> 39:41.588
That's what it says here.

39:41.796 --> 39:42.964
Eh. As long as it tastes good.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.883
That's what I've always said.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.636
Andy, want to do the honors.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.473
Uh-oh. Uh, be back in a second.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.147
So...

39:59.355 --> 40:01.166
Think Denise is safe? What
are you trying to say?

40:01.190 --> 40:02.817
Is she gonna keep
her mouth shut,

40:03.026 --> 40:04.611
about all this?

40:04.819 --> 40:06.539
Look, I've never met a
girl like her before.

40:08.823 --> 40:12.785
She just gets me. Besides, I've
seen her drop a buck at 80 yards.

40:12.994 --> 40:16.080
Okay, well, perfect reason to
expose the family's traditions.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.624
Great, Bart.

40:17.832 --> 40:18.625
You got a problem with
my choices, Andy?

40:18.833 --> 40:19.834
I do.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.544
I think you're being stupid.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.213
She puts everything at risk.
She's a fucking cop.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.382
Dispatcher. There's a difference.
Even better.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.260
So she'll call every cop in the city.
You better back down, Andy.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.322
You didn't even tell me you'd
invited her to dinner.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.889
I didn't know I needed to.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.366
Is it so surprising that
I have a girlfriend?

40:34.390 --> 40:35.600
I'm talking about you

40:35.767 --> 40:37.226
inviting some random
stranger over

40:37.435 --> 40:39.395
for Christmas dinner
without telling anybody.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.244
Cindy and pop knew. Maybe if you
came around more than once a year,

40:42.273 --> 40:43.358
you'd know.

40:45.485 --> 40:49.030
Shut up. Shut up.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.741
Bite it in the ass.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.660
Please stop, please.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.912
Please stop. Pop.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.880
Save him for granny's
rocky mountain oysters.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.458
Oh, shoot! You're right.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.293
Got a little excited there.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.255
So, 400 for how long?
Twenty minutes.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.007
Then reduce the heat to 325

41:08.216 --> 41:09.884
until the inside is pink.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.552
Finish low and slow.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.221
That is how you get
the crispy skin.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.473
Mmm! My favorite part!

41:15.682 --> 41:18.893
Mom always said the gravy needed the
most time. It takes the longest.

41:19.102 --> 41:23.940
Mmm, gotta let the gravy soak up
those giblet juices overnight.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.901
And you need really
mature ingredients.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.197
Open the kidneys,

41:31.406 --> 41:32.573
let 'em breathe in the sauce.

41:32.782 --> 41:34.283
Mom taught me that.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.869
Yeah, one hell of a
cook, god rest her.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.371
Cindy's got the gift too.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.081
Well, I am trying.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.874
Hey, thanks for your help.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.852
It's-it's been nice to
have an extra set of hands

41:43.876 --> 41:46.045
around the kitchen again.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.297
Oh, ladies!

41:48.506 --> 41:50.133
<i>Oh, oh!</i>

41:50.341 --> 41:52.051
Excuse me.

41:54.887 --> 41:57.932
Delicious! Just
like your mother's.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.267
Is the food ready?

41:59.475 --> 42:00.560
We got a ton of work to do.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.854
Let's eat.

42:22.331 --> 42:24.417
You better buy me dinner first.
No.No, no, no, no.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.960
L... are-are you okay?

42:26.169 --> 42:28.755
L-i just wanted to see
if you were okay.

42:31.299 --> 42:34.635
How's your head? Splitting.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.063
Where'd the party go?

42:47.648 --> 42:49.567
I guess they're done.

42:49.776 --> 42:50.776
For now.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.405
How is your shoulder?

42:58.743 --> 43:00.495
It really hurts.

43:03.372 --> 43:04.415
Listen.

43:06.042 --> 43:08.461
Whatever he wants
you to finish...

43:10.171 --> 43:12.590
Don't give him the satisfaction.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.356
Bon appétit!

43:28.564 --> 43:32.318
Denise, you will never leave
this family's table hungry.

43:32.527 --> 43:33.945
Cindy, that's beautiful.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.363
Ooh, doggie.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.365
E-everybody bow your heads.

43:37.573 --> 43:40.535
Dear lord, we thank you
for this bountiful feast

43:40.743 --> 43:42.787
that you have provided for us,

43:42.995 --> 43:44.455
and we also thank
you for bringing

43:44.664 --> 43:47.166
our loved ones back home again.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.001
And even though
some of our beloved

43:49.210 --> 43:52.421
can't be with us today,
we take great pleasure

43:52.630 --> 43:55.466
in knowing that they
are up there with you.

43:55.675 --> 43:56.676
Amen.

43:56.884 --> 43:57.969
Amen.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.388
Bart, will you do the honors?

44:00.596 --> 44:02.265
You bet I will.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.100
Granny, your plate.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.518
No! No!

44:05.726 --> 44:07.562
Where are your manners?

44:07.770 --> 44:10.106
Denise is new to the table.
She should go first.

44:13.943 --> 44:15.069
Go ahead.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.771
Honey, you don't have to
if you're not feeling it.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.422
Yes, she does! She
definitely does!

44:34.630 --> 44:36.090
No, she doesn't!

44:36.299 --> 44:38.139
If she wants to have
Christmas with our family,

44:38.301 --> 44:39.552
she does!

45:38.694 --> 45:41.697
I love it.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.367
Cindy, you have your mother's
gift for the kitchen.

45:44.575 --> 45:47.620
Well, I just
followed her recipe.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.538
The flavor is so rich.
Oh, thanks.

45:49.747 --> 45:52.500
L-i can give you the
recipe if you want it.

45:56.045 --> 45:58.297
It's not supposed
to be like this.

46:00.341 --> 46:02.635
Not on Christmas.

46:05.304 --> 46:07.807
I hate to break it to you,

46:08.015 --> 46:11.185
but Christmas is just a
shithole day like any other.

46:11.394 --> 46:12.520
No.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.146
It's not right.

46:14.355 --> 46:15.648
It's not.

46:15.856 --> 46:18.192
Christmas is supposed

46:18.401 --> 46:21.529
to be about chestnuts,

46:21.737 --> 46:23.614
and nutcrackers.

46:23.823 --> 46:29.203
It's about cookies
and food, and...

46:29.412 --> 46:30.621
And snow.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.834
I see it every year.

46:35.042 --> 46:38.421
And I always wanted to have it.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.172
And I never had it.

46:40.381 --> 46:43.426
This year I was sure...

46:43.634 --> 46:46.262
I was sure that I...

46:49.390 --> 46:51.767
It's not supposed
to be like this.

46:51.976 --> 46:56.147
It's supposed to be about
warmth and tradition,

46:56.355 --> 47:00.234
and if it's special...

47:00.443 --> 47:02.361
I mean really special...

47:05.865 --> 47:09.535
There'll be a white Christmas.

47:10.661 --> 47:14.206
Christmas is dead.

47:14.415 --> 47:15.833
That's not true.

47:16.042 --> 47:17.376
It's not.

47:17.585 --> 47:19.712
It's about family, right?

47:19.920 --> 47:21.130
And family is forever.

47:21.339 --> 47:24.675
Shut up, you naive
son of a bitch.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.511
Christmas?

47:27.720 --> 47:28.971
Family?

47:29.180 --> 47:30.931
This crap.

47:31.140 --> 47:33.726
That's what that group of
motherfuckers is up there.

47:33.934 --> 47:35.936
You know, we need more families

47:36.145 --> 47:38.230
with their own
special traditions,

47:38.439 --> 47:41.192
traditions they Cherish,
can't do without.

47:44.153 --> 47:45.863
Welcome to the family.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.076
And if that's what
it is up there,

47:50.284 --> 47:52.036
I don't want to be a part.

47:52.244 --> 47:53.871
And that's okay
with me, you know,

47:54.080 --> 47:57.458
because I am alone and i
am happy, can't you tell?

47:59.085 --> 48:01.796
I've never had anybody
looking out for me.

48:03.672 --> 48:05.091
No, but, hey, cheer up.

48:07.051 --> 48:10.554
Maybe by some lucky chance, you
have a friend in your life,

48:10.763 --> 48:12.083
someone who is
watching your back,

48:12.181 --> 48:14.683
loves you like a brother.

48:14.892 --> 48:16.769
You got that in your life?

48:16.977 --> 48:19.313
No, because, hell, i
don't have any friends,

48:19.522 --> 48:22.108
and apparently you don't
have any close by.

48:22.316 --> 48:24.318
So I guess that means
we have vip invitations

48:24.527 --> 48:27.905
to the holiday dinner,
and we're the Turkey.

48:28.114 --> 48:29.865
Merry fucking Christmas!

48:30.074 --> 48:31.659
Please stop.

48:47.216 --> 48:48.300
Hey.

48:56.725 --> 48:59.645
Which reindeer had
the worst manners?

48:59.854 --> 49:01.689
What?

49:04.984 --> 49:07.319
<i>“Rude-mph .“</i>

49:20.082 --> 49:21.667
merry Christmas.

49:32.761 --> 49:33.761
Now?

49:35.598 --> 49:37.391
Hell, I'm just gonna say it.

49:38.476 --> 49:39.476
We're getting married.

49:39.518 --> 49:40.936
What?!

49:41.145 --> 49:43.898
Barty, my boy, I'm
so happy for you!

49:44.106 --> 49:46.192
You've chosen the right
lady, I'll tell you that.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.403
Well, I'd like to
propose a toast.

49:49.612 --> 49:52.406
Bart, I never thought
I'd see the day,

49:52.615 --> 49:54.533
but it looks like
you've found yourself

49:54.742 --> 49:56.911
a really great girl.

49:57.119 --> 49:59.788
Welcome to our family, Denise.

49:59.997 --> 50:04.043
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers!

50:04.251 --> 50:05.336
Gosh, this is so exciting.

50:05.544 --> 50:07.963
Hey, let's have a talk.

50:08.172 --> 50:09.924
That'd be great.

50:10.132 --> 50:13.219
She could destroy hundreds of
years of family tradition.

50:13.427 --> 50:15.429
Andy, have a seat.

50:15.638 --> 50:17.223
I'll stand.

50:17.431 --> 50:18.974
Okay, but lower your voice.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.434
Let's talk about this.

50:20.643 --> 50:22.853
She smells like a pig to me,

50:23.020 --> 50:27.858
and if she is not a cop, she
is as close as one gets.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.361
Look, Andy, i trusted
your mother.

50:30.569 --> 50:32.696
She had no idea what
she was walking into

50:32.905 --> 50:35.866
that first Christmas.

50:36.075 --> 50:38.452
I still remember her
face the first bite.

50:38.661 --> 50:42.498
Pop, Bart cannot toss some
random chick into the mold

50:42.706 --> 50:44.708
and expect her to
turn out like mom.

50:44.917 --> 50:47.461
I don't think you're
understanding me here.

50:47.670 --> 50:51.006
The reason your mother turned
into the woman that you knew

50:51.215 --> 50:52.675
is because she was
open to change.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.386
Now that girl is ready
to embrace our family

50:55.594 --> 50:57.555
because she loves Bart.

50:57.763 --> 50:59.598
I had an amazing time tonight.

50:59.807 --> 51:01.016
Why don't you stay?

51:01.225 --> 51:03.018
I gotta be to work really early.

51:03.227 --> 51:05.271
Nobody else will come in on Christmas.
That's fine.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.606
Get up early. But stay tonight.

51:07.815 --> 51:11.235
I don't think your
brother would like that.

51:11.402 --> 51:12.722
Which is more
important to you...

51:12.820 --> 51:14.196
Your family or your career?

51:14.405 --> 51:15.840
Pop, listen to me... I
am not about to let

51:15.864 --> 51:17.241
some bitch grow a conscience

51:17.449 --> 51:19.493
and decide it's time
to protect and serve.

51:19.702 --> 51:21.996
Everything I've worked
for would be destroyed.

51:22.204 --> 51:27.835
Son, I'd like to be a
grandpa someday...

51:28.043 --> 51:30.921
See a few tots running
around on Christmas morning.

51:31.130 --> 51:34.091
This family needs to go on.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.803
This family's traditions
need to go on.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.972
Hope you two will join me
in a little celebration.

51:40.014 --> 51:41.056
Oh, yeah.

51:41.265 --> 51:42.641
Got 'em at a gas station,

51:42.850 --> 51:44.852
so I can't vouch
for their quality.

51:45.060 --> 51:48.731
Andy. Join me?

52:09.710 --> 52:11.128
Briskett.

52:11.337 --> 52:12.977
You get a little messy
with your spelling,

52:13.047 --> 52:16.800
but, shit, this is some
of your best work.

52:19.803 --> 52:22.389
Now, we can do this the hard way

52:22.598 --> 52:24.516
or the easy way, your choice.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.479
I don't want to finish the job.

52:28.687 --> 52:30.189
What?

52:30.397 --> 52:32.983
Well, a lot of it is...
Don't get brave, briskett.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.819
I mean, technically, it's
not even my department.

52:36.028 --> 52:37.321
I'm in data assessment.

52:37.529 --> 52:38.989
A lot of that is
analysis response,

52:39.198 --> 52:41.408
so I'm not even... Do you
think I give a shit?!

52:43.994 --> 52:46.080
Finish the fucking job!

52:55.839 --> 52:59.009
Stop it, you fucking bastard!

53:00.469 --> 53:02.096
I don't think so!

53:11.355 --> 53:13.065
Please stop!

53:13.273 --> 53:14.273
Please stop!

53:18.362 --> 53:21.990
You know you're not the best statistical
analysis man in the office, right?

53:22.199 --> 53:25.202
Fred is. But Fred's not a guy who
is willing to go the extra mile.

53:25.411 --> 53:26.411
You are.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.330
Work is your life.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.545
Why are you doing this?

53:34.753 --> 53:38.507
One, because my family likes their
steaks with heavy marbling.

53:38.716 --> 53:41.969
And two, because nobody's
gonna know that you're gone

53:42.177 --> 53:45.389
<i>'rust because there's an extra
donut 'm the break room'.!</i>

53:46.932 --> 53:48.767
So, let's get some work done.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.187
Oh, no.

53:52.396 --> 53:55.899
It's not that easy, briskett.
Oh, no!

53:56.108 --> 53:59.570
You're not done until
I say you are done!

54:01.905 --> 54:03.949
I'm the boss!

54:05.242 --> 54:07.161
I don't want to work anymore!

54:07.369 --> 54:10.080
That is not your decision!

54:10.289 --> 54:12.040
It's mine!

54:16.670 --> 54:18.172
Finish it!

54:37.858 --> 54:39.026
Stop it.

54:40.027 --> 54:41.487
Please!

54:41.695 --> 54:43.155
You're running out
of time, briskett!

54:43.363 --> 54:44.656
Okay! Yes!

54:44.865 --> 54:47.409
Yes, I'll do it!

54:50.329 --> 54:52.664
Please just stop hurting her.

55:12.768 --> 55:14.008
I just want to be the first one

55:14.061 --> 55:16.230
to wish you a merry Christmas.

55:17.397 --> 55:18.941
All right, I'm early,

55:19.149 --> 55:20.692
but you know I'm
always in a hurry

55:20.901 --> 55:22.110
to get to Christmas morning.

55:22.319 --> 55:24.154
L just love it so much.

55:24.363 --> 55:26.448
I wish you could see it.

55:26.657 --> 55:30.202
This house is alive again,
just like the old days.

55:31.829 --> 55:34.331
Andy has finally
come home again.

55:34.540 --> 55:36.750
Thought it would take an army.

55:36.959 --> 55:39.169
Boy works too much,

55:39.378 --> 55:42.422
but he brought his
work with him.

55:42.631 --> 55:44.258
Cindy helped with that.

55:44.466 --> 55:47.219
Nice to see the two of
them working together.

55:47.427 --> 55:48.637
Oh, and Bart...

55:48.846 --> 55:50.973
Bart has found love,

55:51.181 --> 55:53.559
a girl who suits him so well,

55:53.767 --> 55:57.563
they're like two peas in a pod.

55:57.771 --> 56:00.274
They remind me of us.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.819
L just thought you should
hear the good news.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.779
Merry Christmas, honey.

57:51.343 --> 57:53.053
Christmas!

57:53.261 --> 57:54.388
Fuck Christmas!

57:54.596 --> 57:56.014
Pam, hello! Merry Christmas!

57:56.223 --> 57:57.808
Listen, Matt. Michael.

57:58.016 --> 57:59.869
Did you know that there's a
company Christmas party?

57:59.893 --> 58:02.104
Yeah, I'm... A little swamped.

58:02.312 --> 58:04.481
Did you get an invitation?

58:04.690 --> 58:05.816
No.

58:06.024 --> 58:07.901
Exactly. Neither did I.

58:08.110 --> 58:10.362
But I got a great party favor.

58:10.570 --> 58:12.406
A pink slip. Isn't that cute?

58:12.614 --> 58:15.075
The bastards! I-l don't
think that's a good idea.

58:15.283 --> 58:17.119
Do you know what's
a good idea, Matt?

58:17.327 --> 58:19.555
Getting the hell out of this
place while you're still alive.

58:19.579 --> 58:21.707
No, no. I'm just gonna
finish up this work

58:21.915 --> 58:24.155
and I'm gonna bring it to Mr.
Robillard. Screw robillard!

58:24.292 --> 58:27.129
He will eat you alive
and spit out the bones!

58:34.261 --> 58:36.304
Come on.

58:37.389 --> 58:38.807
You're alive?

58:39.016 --> 58:40.726
Fuck yeah, I'm alive.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.644
I'm getting the
fuck out of here,

58:42.853 --> 58:45.939
and you're coming with me.

58:46.148 --> 58:47.649
I don't want to lose my job.

58:47.858 --> 58:50.777
What? Fuck yeah, you do.

58:50.986 --> 58:53.196
Come on.

59:00.078 --> 59:02.706
I'll strangle all
those motherfuckers.

59:02.914 --> 59:04.291
Come on.

59:04.499 --> 59:05.917
My health insurance...

59:06.126 --> 59:07.627
Help. Work with me.
Come on. 401k.

59:07.836 --> 59:10.088
Shut the fuck up. You
want to play games?

59:10.297 --> 59:12.299
Shut up!

59:12.507 --> 59:14.593
Shut up. Come on, look
at me, you're free.

59:14.801 --> 59:16.261
You're fucking free.
You got out.

59:16.470 --> 59:18.597
Help her first, help her first.

59:18.805 --> 59:21.349
Come on.

59:25.437 --> 59:26.437
Fuck. Fuck.

59:31.151 --> 59:33.361
Go. No.

59:33.570 --> 59:34.810
She's dying, man. No, she's not.

59:34.905 --> 59:35.697
She's dying, dude, I'm sorry.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.032
Get help.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.950
- Go now.
- No.

59:39.159 --> 59:40.869
She's done, man.

59:41.078 --> 59:42.287
Go.

59:42.496 --> 59:43.830
This is no good. We can't...

59:44.039 --> 59:46.208
We can't leave you!
Michael, shut up.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.377
You're my best chance for help.

59:53.381 --> 59:55.050
Get us out of here now.

59:56.176 --> 59:58.095
Listen, we gotta go.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.679
Go.

59:59.888 --> 01:00:01.807
Go!

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:03.183
Yes.

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:06.019
Let's go.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:07.604
Let's go.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.558
Do you want some
coffee before you go?

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:47.519
Yes, please.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.487
Tell me everything.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:59.281
So, how did he propose?

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.199
Catalina, last week.

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:03.493
Barty is such a big sweetie.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.745
I'll pound 'em! I'll
fuckin' kill 'em!

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:08.999
I'll fuckin' kill 'em! Shh! Shh!

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.792
He did it right at the water.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.085
One knee?

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:15.005
It was so romantic.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:16.923
Can I help you grab anything?

01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:18.508
Come on. Open the fucking door.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.010
Open the fucking door, bitch.

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.761
No. Shh! Bite it!

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:22.989
So, what are you doing awake?

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.014
Dessert!

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:25.682
Got to get started early.

01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:28.226
Such a big job, getting
the holiday together.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:31.146
Sometimes it can
feel like torture,

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.981
but I'm actually loving it.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.364
Hey, do you mind checking the
pantry for the measuring cups?

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.413
Oh, wait. Here they are.
I got 'em.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.714
Mind if I grab some sugar?

01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:59.341
Yeah, help yourself.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.176
Time to go wake granny.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.802
I can't do this all myself.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:05.722
Well, next year, I'll
be here to help...

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.849
Officially.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.100
I can't wait.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.729
I'd better get ready.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:54.062
Good morning, granny,
you want some coffee?

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:12.080
Hold your breath, hold your
breath, hold your breath.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:41.318
Okay, okay, quickly, go, 90-

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:42.712
granny, I'm gonna
start on the cookies.

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:44.029
Fuck!

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:51.870
Michael, go.

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.705
I can't.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.248
What?! Go!

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:56.541
No!

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.252
We have to go. We have to go!

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:51.846
Bart, honey, what are you doing up?
Hey.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.807
Just wanted to say
merry Christmas.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.434
You're so sweet. <i>We'll</i> see you

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.520
after work, right? You <i>will.</i>

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.814
I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.023
Bye, honey.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:03.441
Bye, babe.

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:08.321
So you just let her leave?

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:10.782
I love her. Get over it.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:12.534
Get the keys!

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:15.078
Fuck you!

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.875
Fuck you, you crazy
fucking bitch!

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:23.128
You ate my legs!

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:25.088
You ate my fucking legs!

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:26.965
Fuck Bart!

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:32.929
Where's the gun! Where's
the fucking gun?

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.889
She's not fighting anymore.

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.187
I'm gonna smash her head!

01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:42.730
I'm gonna smash
her fucking head!

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.607
Come on, Mike! No,
no, no, no, no!

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.234
Come on, Mike, come on.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.653
Fuck. Fuck. No, I'm not done.

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.363
No. No!

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:53.324
No, I'm not done. I'm not done.

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:58.455
Come here. Come here.
Open this fucking door!

01:05:58.663 --> 01:05:59.956
Open this fucking door!

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:01.416
Aah! Aah!

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.835
Is she alive? I
don't give a fuck!

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.130
Goddamn, that felt good!

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.132
Let me look again! Let me look!

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.592
Hey, fuck you. Hey, hey, hey!

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.844
Hey! Hey, we gotta go!

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:15.239
We gotta fucking go! They can see us!
What the fuck are you doing?

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:16.973
I broke the keys off
in the ignition.

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:18.558
<i>We can't drive.</i>

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:20.185
Michael.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.395
We gotta run. Let's
get out of here.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:24.230
No. They can fucking see us...

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:25.773
Outside the window,
now let's go!

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.942
No! I'm going back!

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:29.694
What?! Are you fucking crazy?

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:33.490
Katherine's in there! We
can't leave her alone.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.634
Let's just go to one of these
houses and ask for help.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:36.826
Which one, Eddie?

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:38.912
The ones with decorations?

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.788
The ones without?

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:44.083
Which family inside is any
different than this one?

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:47.378
I'm going back.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:51.674
All right. Okay. Let's go.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.666
I'm just so happy for Bart.

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:27.335
I know. She seems really great.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.337
Fuck the holidays.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.464
Finishing my goddamn
work right now.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:35.552
I've never seen your brothers
act like this before.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.888
Great. Perfect timing.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.641
Oh, it's all right. I'll get it.

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:43.476
You just put it in with the rest

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.645
of the wash.

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:49.732
Merry Christmas. My
brothers hate each other.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:01.828
Oh, I do love carolers.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.970
<i>Brisket“!</i>

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:24.434
What?!

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:26.144
Merry Christmas, bitch!

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:27.812
Aah!

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:41.576
I'm really sorry, granny.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.299
What is all the racket here?

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:06.350
Aah! Aah!

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:09.520
I'm sorry.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:18.363
I'm no... I'm not...

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.365
I'm not sorry!

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.783
I'm not... sorry!

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:27.955
I'm not... sorry anymore!

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:30.207
Yeah, fuck sorry!
You're not sorry!

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.794
Fuck them! Fuck this
fucking family!

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.045
Kill him!

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:46.599
Fuck you! Come on, who's next?

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:48.017
Who's next?

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:52.897
<i>Brisket“!</i>

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.443
We've got work to do!

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.531
Recognize this, shithead?

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.783
Little fucker!

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:05.368
<i>L'll</i> fucking kill you!

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:16.045
Fucking kill them!

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:17.672
Daddy's dead, bitch.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.425
I'm gonna kill you!

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:32.270
Fuck you, Michael!

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:34.480
You little fuckin' bastard!
Fuck you!

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.816
Kill you like I
killed your bitch!

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.989
Unplug! Unplug!

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.437
I'm gonna tear you into pieces,

you stupid fuck!

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:47.743
Aah!

You bitch!

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.800
Fuck!

I'll kill you!

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:24.113
Motherfucker!

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:29.118
Not talking now, are you?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.001
There's two kinds of people
in this world, brisket...

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.836
The workers,

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:42.465
and the ones that tell
the workers what to do!

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.592
That's not gonna change.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:57.396
I'm gonna eat your ass!

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.376
It's time for you to die!

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.630
Piece of shit!

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.383
She was my pretty little flower!
My baby!

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:26.884
Your bitch looked like a man!

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:30.888
Bart!

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:39.647
You don't know who I am!

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.567
I'm Michael briskett!

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.987
Not just another
guy in the office!

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.364
I do have friends!

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:56.873
Die, you fucking bitch!

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:09.760

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:44.837
Turn it off!
