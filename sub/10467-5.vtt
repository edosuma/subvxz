WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.655
PICK ME UP.
I CAN'T SEE.

00:03.655 --> 00:05.831
SO IT'S JUST
A PRECAUTION, RIGHT?

00:05.831 --> 00:07.398
I MEAN,
SHE HASN'T GOTTEN
ANY INFECTIONS?

00:07.398 --> 00:08.921
KNOCK ON WOOD.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.184
AND DAPHNE'S COLD
IS PRETTY MUCH GONE.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.359
SO WHEN DOES SHE
COME OUT OF THIS THING?

00:11.359 --> 00:13.013
WHEN CAN YOU GUYS
HOLD HER?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.102
OH...WELL,
IT'S KIND OF COMPLICATED--

00:15.102 --> 00:16.755
Charlie:
THEY WANT HER TO PUT ON
A LITTLE BIT MORE WEIGHT.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.409
SO, IT'S GET HER PAST
THE INFECTION RISK,

00:18.409 --> 00:21.760
GET HER STARTED EATING...
AND THEN HOME.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.761
YOU MUST BE DYING
TO HOLD HER.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.415
YEAH, BUT--

00:24.415 --> 00:25.634
ON THE OTHER HAND,
AS LONG AS THE BABY'S OK,

00:25.634 --> 00:27.114
IT MUST BE GREAT
TO GET YOUR REST.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.506
I MEAN,
YOU HAD MAJOR SURGERY.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.160
IT'S TRUE, EXCEPT--

00:30.160 --> 00:31.901
AREN'T YOU EXHAUSTED?
DOESN'T IT WIPE YOU OUT,

00:31.901 --> 00:33.424
CONSTANTLY
SCHLEPPING DOWN
TO LOOK AT THE BABY?

00:35.296 --> 00:37.776
UH...YEAH, ACTUALLY.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.778
I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT
EXHAUSTED RIGHT NOW.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.476
OK, BACK IN YOUR CHAIR.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.956
I'M GONNA GET YOU BACK
TO YOUR ROOM.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.349
BE CAREFUL WHERE
YOU'RE SITTING, OK?

00:45.349 --> 00:47.351
GET THAT FOOT THINGY.

00:47.351 --> 00:48.526
CAREFUL.

00:48.526 --> 00:49.962
THANKS. THANK YOU.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.095
THANKS!

00:52.095 --> 00:53.531
CAN WE COME
VISIT YOU LATER

00:53.531 --> 00:54.706
AFTER WE'VE FINISHED
OGLING THE BABY?

00:54.706 --> 00:55.968
UH-UH. NO.

00:55.968 --> 00:58.188
SHE NEEDS HER REST.UH, SORRY.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.407
CONTROLLING
BOYFRIEND'S ORDERS.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.584
Owen: BYE.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.235
DAPHNE...
SHE SEEMS OK NOW,
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:45.235 --> 01:48.195
YEAH, SHE DOES. SO FAR.

01:48.195 --> 01:51.546
BUT EVEN IF DIANE
IS OUT OF THE WOODS,

01:51.546 --> 01:53.243
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

01:53.243 --> 01:57.247
I MEAN, SOMEBODY HAS TO BE
WITH HER EVERY SECOND.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.684
IT'S LIKE THIS IS
THEIR WHOLE LIFE NOW.

01:59.684 --> 02:02.861
YEAH. IT'S NOT
FOR EVERYBODY, IS IT?

02:02.861 --> 02:05.473
YOU KNOW, THE KID THING.

02:07.039 --> 02:07.953
[SIGHS]

02:09.041 --> 02:10.173
OK...

02:12.175 --> 02:14.917
I WANT TO DO IT
SOMEDAY, SARAH.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.092
HAVE KIDS. YOU KNOW THAT.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.050
YEAH, I KNOW.

02:18.050 --> 02:21.402
AND I WOULD NEVER
PULL A "WILL"
AND, LIKE, WALK AWAY.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.577
GOD, OF COURSE NOT.

02:22.577 --> 02:25.623
BUT IF I HAD TO
CHOOSE WHEN--

02:25.623 --> 02:27.582
THAT'S KIND OF
THE POINT, BAILEY.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.149
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
I ASKED YOU
THE QUESTION.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.933
'CAUSE IF THERE'S
AN ACCIDENT,

02:30.933 --> 02:32.282
YOU KIND OF
DON'T GET TO CHOOSE.

02:32.282 --> 02:35.242
I KNOW. AND I'M SAYING--

02:35.242 --> 02:41.291
I'M SAYING...
THAT I'M A REALLY LUCKY GUY

02:41.291 --> 02:42.423
TO HAVE EVERYTHING
THAT I HAVE,

02:42.423 --> 02:45.077
A GREAT JOB AND,
I MEAN...

02:45.077 --> 02:47.297
YOU.

02:47.297 --> 02:50.953
I HAVE YOU. AND...

02:50.953 --> 02:54.913
THAT'S KIND OF ALL
I HAVE ROOM FOR RIGHT NOW.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.568
I DON'T WANT TO BE
A FATHER, TOO.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.182
AND IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU AND ME.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.618
BECAUSE YOU AND ME--

03:03.618 --> 03:06.838
OH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

03:12.844 --> 03:16.500
MAG? MAGGIE, THERE'S
SOMETHING BLOCKING THE--

03:16.500 --> 03:18.067
IT'S MY LAUNDRY.
SORRY.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.333
OH, WELL, UH, I HAVE
A TON TO WASH, TOO.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.074
I COULD DO OURS TOGETHER
IF YOU WANT.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.815
WHY? WOULD THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

03:26.815 --> 03:28.817
WOULD THAT MAKE YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE REALLY MY FRIEND?

03:28.817 --> 03:32.037
NO, THAT'S NOT...
I WAS JUST--

03:32.037 --> 03:33.256
WHAT DID CAMPUS HOUSING SAY?

03:33.256 --> 03:35.737
OH. WELL, IT TURNS OUT

03:35.737 --> 03:37.173
THERE'S ALREADY
A WAITING LIST
FOR TRANSFERS.

03:37.173 --> 03:40.481
PROBABLY BE A COUPLE
MONTHS AT LEAST.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.004
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR A REFUND
IF ONE OF US

03:42.004 --> 03:43.962
WANTS TO MOVE
OFF CAMPUS,

03:43.962 --> 03:46.400
BUT THEY SAID
SOMETIMES YOU CAN FIND
SOMEONE IN THE DORM

03:46.400 --> 03:47.401
WHO'S WILLING TO--

03:47.401 --> 03:49.272
CAN YOU PLEASE SHUT UP?

03:51.100 --> 03:52.884
YOU--YOU JUST ASKED ME--

03:52.884 --> 03:54.625
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
FOR AN ESSAY ANSWER.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.890
MAGGIE, I AM SORRY.

03:58.890 --> 04:02.285
I'M...
SO INCREDIBLY SORRY,

04:02.285 --> 04:05.897
I FEEL LIKE I'M
GONNA BE SORRY FOREVER.

04:05.897 --> 04:09.466
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE STUCK HERE
TOGETHER.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.294
AND GOD, I WISH
I COULD CHANGE THAT,

04:11.294 --> 04:13.514
I WISH I COULD, LIKE,
DROP OUT OF EC-12

04:13.514 --> 04:17.518
OR JUST VANISH
FROM THIS ROOM OR...

04:17.518 --> 04:19.302
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THAT'S THE ANSWER.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.738
MAYBE I CAN JUST
STAY AWAY FROM HERE

04:20.738 --> 04:22.610
FROM WHENEVER
TILL WHENEVER.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.351
YOU KNOW,
JUST DRAW A LINE THROUGH
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.918
OK.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.791
OK. OK? DID YOU SAY OK?

04:31.488 --> 04:35.666
SO WHEN CAN WHENEVER BE?
FROM WHEN TILL WHEN?

04:37.755 --> 04:39.366
HOW ABOUT STARTING NOW?

04:42.064 --> 04:45.633
OK...FINE.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.505
FROM NOW TILL WHEN?

04:48.505 --> 04:50.855
HOW ABOUT NEVER?

04:54.468 --> 04:56.208
LET'S SEE
WHAT ELSE IS ON.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.167
FIND THE STOOGES.
DO THEY HAVE
THE STOOGES?

04:58.167 --> 05:00.343
I DON'T KNOW.I SWEAR TO GOD,

05:00.343 --> 05:01.866
I WOULD HAVE GONE
ALL THE WAY POSTAL

05:01.866 --> 05:02.867
WITHOUT THIS
MINI-CASINO.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.565
HA HA HA.

05:04.565 --> 05:08.133
COME ON
LUCKY 9, LUCKY 9!
BABY NEEDS A NEW--

05:08.133 --> 05:09.047
HELLO.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.486
OH, MY GOD.

05:12.486 --> 05:15.880
WHY IS SHE--
NO ONE SAID SHE'D BE OUT
OF THE INCUBATOR SO SOON.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.536
DR. MURTRY SAID
WHEN SHE HIT 3 POUNDS 8--

05:19.536 --> 05:20.842
OH, MY GOD.

05:23.801 --> 05:27.327
SHE'S SO TINY AND...
PERFECT.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.982
LET ME SEE. LET ME SEE!
LET ME SEE.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.897
CAN HE? IS IT OK
IF HE TOUCHES HER?

05:32.897 --> 05:34.029
HE'D PICK UP A LOT
OF BUGS AT SCHOOL.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.205
OK.
CLAUD, COULD YOU...

05:36.205 --> 05:38.163
COME ON, OWEN.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.296
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO BUY BABY DIANA
A PRESENT, HUH?

05:40.296 --> 05:43.038
BUT I WANT TO SEE THE BABY.
I WANT TO SEE HER!

05:46.650 --> 05:48.913
YOU WANT TO HOLD HER?

05:48.913 --> 05:53.440
I'M SCARED
I MIGHT BREAK HER.
SHE'S SO LITTLE.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.832
SUPPORT THE HEAD.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.443
OH...

05:56.443 --> 05:57.400
THAT'S IT.
LIKE THIS?
IS THIS OK?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.097
THAT'S IT. GENTLY.

05:59.097 --> 06:00.751
OH, OH MY GOD.
DOES THAT HURT HER?

06:00.751 --> 06:02.666
NO, NO, NO.
SHE'S FINE.

06:02.666 --> 06:03.667
LIKE THIS?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.277
THAT'S IT.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.888
OH, MY GOD.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.150
I KNOW.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.195
OH, MY GOD.
I KNOW.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.632
OH, MY GOD.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.508
HEY, LOOK, OWE.
IT'S THE STOOGES.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.249
I LIKE TO WATCH
WITH CHARLIE.

06:20.249 --> 06:24.427
HE LAUGHS AT ALL
THE DUMB PARTS
WITH ME.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.777
I CAN LAUGH
AT THE DUMB PARTS.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.039
I CAN.

06:28.039 --> 06:33.088
OH, MAN,
THAT'S REALLY DUMB.

06:33.088 --> 06:36.091
BUT--BUT FUNNY.
VERY FUNNY.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.223
HEY, PARTNER.
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

06:38.223 --> 06:39.094
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HEADING BACK TO SCHOOL.

06:40.443 --> 06:44.969
UH, NO. NOT YET. YOU KNOW.

06:44.969 --> 06:48.669
'CAUSE CHARLIE NEEDS MY HELP
WITH...YOU KNOW, STUFF.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.322
OH. RIGHT.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.412
SO YOU'RE GONNA HANG OUT
FOR A COUPLE EXTRA DAYS?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.413
THAT'S THE PLAN?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
UM...BASICALLY.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.807
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
CALL HANOVER, RIGHT?

06:56.807 --> 06:58.287
LET 'EM KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING?

06:58.287 --> 07:01.377
MAKE SURE THEY'RE
OK WITH EVERYTHING?

07:01.377 --> 07:03.292
YOU KNOW DIANA'S
OUT OF HER INCUBATOR, RIGHT?

07:03.292 --> 07:04.859
I MEAN, THEY JUST
BROUGHT HER IN,

07:04.859 --> 07:06.556
AND THEY'RE ALL, LIKE,
PASSING HER AROUND.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.905
THE BABY?
IT'S OK TO HOLD HER?

07:07.905 --> 07:09.603
YEAH.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.518
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
THAT CALL, RIGHT?

07:11.518 --> 07:13.694
YOU'D BETTER GO. THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE HER AWAY ANY SECOND.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.308
[SIGHS]

07:19.308 --> 07:22.790
DON'T THEY EVER USE
A FRYING PAN FOR COOKING?

07:22.790 --> 07:23.965
I KNOW, I KNOW.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.836
SHE WAS
THE SAME WAY WITH ME.

07:25.836 --> 07:28.012
I WENT TO SEE HOW SHE WAS,

07:28.012 --> 07:31.276
AND PRETTY SOON
DANTE'S INFERNO
WAS FLYING AT MY HEAD.

07:31.276 --> 07:32.974
HARDCOVER.

07:32.974 --> 07:37.195
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T REALLY BLAME HER.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.196
ME, NEITHER.

07:38.196 --> 07:41.069
I FEEL EVIL.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.724
I DESERVE THE INFERNO.

07:46.248 --> 07:49.207
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
ALWAYS STAY HERE.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.826
OK. DON'T GET ME WRONG.

07:58.826 --> 08:02.394
'CAUSE WHAT
2 PEOPLE DO TOGETHER
IS NOT MY BUSINESS.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.092
RAY, WE--
WE WERE JUST STUDYING.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.093
AND I NEVER JUDGE--

08:05.093 --> 08:07.530
JUDGE? WHAT?

08:07.530 --> 08:09.010
AND THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH MY CELIBACY.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.446
OR EVEN WITH MY VIRGINITY--

08:10.446 --> 08:12.840
RAY, COULD WE NOT--BUT THE TRUTH IS,

08:12.840 --> 08:14.406
EVEN IF YOU DON'T LOOK
TO GOD FOR GUIDANCE...

08:15.843 --> 08:17.540
I MEAN, IT'S MY ROOM, TOO.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.237
Ned: RAY,
NOTHING'S HAPPENED.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.326
REALLY, PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.806
AH, BUT IN THE FUTURE?

08:22.806 --> 08:26.070
WHAT GOES DOWN--
OR ON...

08:26.070 --> 08:28.682
BETWEEN THESE WALLS,
EVEN IF I'M NOT HERE
WHEN IT HAPPENS--

08:28.682 --> 08:31.859
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.730
I HAVE A TON OF
STUDYING TO DO.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.253
I SHOULD GO TO THAT...
LIBRARY, THERE.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.081
YEAH. ME, TOO. ME, TOO.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.474
Julia:
DO YOU HAVE A BLANKET
IN CASE IT GETS COLD?

08:38.474 --> 08:39.475
YEAH, HERE.

08:39.475 --> 08:40.476
THANKS.

08:40.476 --> 08:41.999
AND TAKE A PILLOW.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.044
OK.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.176
I SHOULD
TAKE ONE, TOO.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.529
AND SOME FOOD.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.837
HEY!

08:55.578 --> 08:57.014
YOU WORKING?

08:57.014 --> 08:58.755
YEAH, I WAS.

08:58.755 --> 08:59.887
GOOD. ME, NEITHER.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.933
SO WHAT ARE YOU UP FOR?

09:02.933 --> 09:05.370
CUDDLE UP WITH A VIDEO?

09:05.370 --> 09:07.155
CUDDLE UP WITH A PIZZA?

09:07.155 --> 09:09.374
CUDDLE UP WITH
A RESTAURANT MANAGER?

09:09.374 --> 09:11.638
WOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT? UM...

09:11.638 --> 09:13.204
THAT SOUNDS
REALLY GREAT,

09:13.204 --> 09:16.643
BUT I'VE GOT THIS
STUPID MIDTERM THING.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.994
YOU KNOW, LATVIA FROM
THE BALTS TO THE TEUTS.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.910
GOD, I'M NOT EVEN IN
THE 1100s YET. SO...

09:22.910 --> 09:24.825
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SINCE I STILL HAVE
REFERENCES TO PULL,

09:24.825 --> 09:27.479
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
GO TO THE LIBRARY.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.873
AT 9 P.M.?

09:29.873 --> 09:31.005
YEAH. I KNOW
IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

09:31.005 --> 09:32.441
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:32.441 --> 09:34.965
I WILL FEEL MUCH BETTER
WHEN I'M DONE.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.664
SO DON'T WAIT UP.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.804
Nurse: HELLO?

09:47.804 --> 09:49.501
MR. AND MRS. SALINGER?

09:49.501 --> 09:51.025
WHAT?

09:51.025 --> 09:53.288
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:53.288 --> 09:55.943
IT'S TIME TO GIVE DIANA
ANOTHER TRY AT THE BREAST.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.206
NOW? AGAIN?

09:58.206 --> 10:00.861
THIS IS DR. NAMPUR,
OUR ON-CALL PEDIATRICIAN.

10:00.861 --> 10:04.212
THIS IS HILLARY,
LACTATION SPECIALIST.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.866
OK, BUT WHY
DO I NEED SO MANY--

10:05.866 --> 10:07.911
Charlie:
TRY NOT TO TALK,
'CAUSE THE BOOK SAYS

10:07.911 --> 10:09.521
THAT YOUR VOICE
DISTRACTS THE BABY.

10:09.521 --> 10:10.827
THAT'S NOT
A PERFECT
LATCH-ON. HERE--

10:10.827 --> 10:12.133
ARE THE NOSTRILS BLOCKED?

10:12.133 --> 10:13.656
THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.136
Nurse: HERE,
TRY MASSAGING THE BREAST.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.528
IF SHE'S NOT LETTING DOWN.
HERE. LIKE THIS.

10:16.528 --> 10:19.053
YOU DO IT. YOU SHOULD--
YOU SHOULD LEARN.

10:19.053 --> 10:22.012
CAN WE-- DOES EVERYONE
HAVE TO BE HERE FOR THIS?

10:22.012 --> 10:23.753
JUST TRY TO RELAX.
HE'LL LET DOWN
EASIER IF YOU RELAX.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.016
COULD WE JUST TRY
THE BOTTLE, PLEASE?

10:26.016 --> 10:28.236
DON'T TELL ME I DID
ALL THAT PUMPING
FOR NOTHING.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.717
IF SHE STARTS ON THE BOTTLE,
SHE'S NOT GONNA WANT TO
GO TO THE BREAST.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.719
NOW WHAT WOULD YOU
RATHER HAVE ON YOUR BREAST?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.111
A BABY OR A PUMP?

10:34.111 --> 10:36.200
CAN I GET BACK TO YOU
ON THAT?

10:36.200 --> 10:39.290
DAPH, COME ON, JUST TRY
AND RELAX LIKE THEY SAID.

10:39.290 --> 10:42.903
HOW CAN I RELAX
WITH HALF THE HOSPITAL
DOWN MY SHIRT, OK?

10:42.903 --> 10:45.993
I GET MORE PRIVACY
TWIRLING PASTIES
AT A SHORE LEAVE PARTY.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.169
IT'S OK. YOU'RE--
YOU'RE SCARING THE BABY.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.213
NO. YOU ARE.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.519
ALL OF YOU.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.260
DAPHNE,
SHE CAN'T GET OFF THE IV

10:52.260 --> 10:53.653
UNTIL SHE STARTS EATING.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.958
WELL, THEN PUT HER
BACK ON THE IV,

10:54.958 --> 10:56.525
BECAUSE THIS
ISN'T WORKING!

10:56.525 --> 10:58.962
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?
IT'S NOT WORKING.

11:00.834 --> 11:01.791
OK.

11:03.793 --> 11:04.751
WE'LL JUST TRY AGAIN LATER.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.859
[ALARM SOUNDS]

11:31.212 --> 11:32.866
HEY.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.827
UM...

11:37.827 --> 11:39.089
ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:39.089 --> 11:40.525
I WAS REACHING
FOR THE SNOOZE,

11:40.525 --> 11:42.049
'CAUSE I NEED
A LITTLE MORE SLEEP.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.877
OK?

11:47.532 --> 11:50.231
WELL, CAN I FRY YOU UP
SOMETHING GREASY
FOR BREAKFAST?

11:50.231 --> 11:51.711
YEAH.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.191
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT
IN A LITTLE BIT.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.803
OK.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.422
SO ASSUMING WE GET THOSE
TAX BREAKS,

12:07.422 --> 12:10.164
I'D SAY WE'RE LOOKING
AT A CASH MARGIN
OF 5 TO 6%.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.688
TIMES 1,800 METRIC TONS--

12:12.688 --> 12:15.256
YOU CAN LOOK AT
THE SPREADSHEET THAT I RAN
WITH ALL THE VARIABLES.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.040
NICE NUMBERS.
VERY NICE.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.999
PROFESSOR BEECH IS
GONNA LIKE THESE.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.958
Maggie: I DON'T KNOW.
BECAUSE WHAT ABOUT
SLIME DISPOSAL?

12:21.958 --> 12:25.353
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
IN HERE ABOUT THOSE COSTS.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.007
I KNOW. I KNOW.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.705
I PUT THAT UNDER
BY-PRODUCT MANAGEMENT.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.534
A 1% CONTINGENCY?

12:32.534 --> 12:33.970
DIDN'T YOU READ
THE BANKRUPTCY REPORT?

12:33.970 --> 12:36.233
IT SAID THAT
THE AVERAGE COST

12:36.233 --> 12:39.889
FOR REFITTING A ZINC-LEAD
BLAST FURNACE WAS UPWARDS
OF A MILLION NINE!

12:39.889 --> 12:43.066
OK, YEAH, BUT IF YOU
AMORTIZE IT BY--

12:43.066 --> 12:45.939
YOU CAN'T AMORTIZE
WHAT YOU DON'T OWN, JULIA.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.550
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A LOW COST STARTUP.

12:48.550 --> 12:53.120
AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED
PERSONNEL RETRAINING,
PENSION AND HEALTH,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.035
SITE MANAGEMENT.

12:55.035 --> 12:58.125
Navin: MAGGIE'S
GOT A GOOD POINT.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.257
I THINK WE GOT
A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE.

13:00.257 --> 13:03.783
DOES ANYONE ELSE
WANT TO TAKE A CRACK
AT THESE NUMBERS?

13:07.308 --> 13:09.614
HERE, SWEETHEART,
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

13:09.614 --> 13:12.487
CAN'T YOU TASTE IT?
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS PULL.

13:12.487 --> 13:15.707
YOU CAN DO IT.
[SIGHS]

13:15.707 --> 13:18.014
SHE WON'T TAKE IT.
MAYBE SHE'S NOT HUNGRY.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.060
LET'S GIVE YOUR WIFE
ANOTHER TRY.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.498
WHY IS SHE GONNA
TAKE IT FROM ME

13:23.498 --> 13:25.282
IF SHE WON'T EVEN
TAKE IT FROM HIM?

13:25.282 --> 13:27.719
IF WE'VE ALREADY TRIED,
LIKE, 8 DOZEN TIMES--

13:27.719 --> 13:30.548
DAPH, COME ON.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.682
[SIGHS]

13:33.682 --> 13:35.597
[CRYING]

13:36.990 --> 13:39.862
SEE? SHE WANTS
TO BE WITH HIM.

13:39.862 --> 13:43.387
SHE'S CRYING BECAUSE
SHE SMELLS YOUR MILK.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.215
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.173
WOULD SOMEBODY
TAKE HER PLEASE?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.872
SOMEBODY?

13:49.872 --> 13:53.702
HEY. SHH...

13:53.702 --> 13:55.835
SHH.
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

13:58.489 --> 14:01.536
LOOK AT THAT.

14:01.536 --> 14:04.452
SHE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE ME.

14:06.193 --> 14:09.283
DOES SHE?

14:09.283 --> 14:10.850
Julia: MR. BEECH,
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.243
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF I CAN MAKE A SWITCH.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.592
WHY DO YOU
WANT TO SWITCH?

14:14.592 --> 14:15.593
WELL, I'M JUST--

14:18.205 --> 14:20.337
IT'S JUST NOT
WORKING OUT IN MY GROUP.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.686
SIR, IF YOU
CAN JUST GIVE ME--

14:21.686 --> 14:23.166
I'LL GET TO EVERYONE,
PEOPLE.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.734
NOT WORKING OUT HOW?

14:25.734 --> 14:28.215
PERSONALITY WISE,
I GUESS.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.520
IF I'M GONNA
SHUFFLE ROSTERS,

14:29.520 --> 14:30.957
I NEED A REASON.

14:30.957 --> 14:35.962
OK. UH...WELL,
IT'S KIND OF A...

14:35.962 --> 14:41.445
WELL, IT'S KIND OF
A BOYFRIEND PROBLEM.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.752
BOYFRIEND?
WHAT BOYFRIEND?

14:43.752 --> 14:47.799
MY ROOMMATE'S. OR MINE.
WELL, HERS AND THEN MINE.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.279
BOTH.

14:49.279 --> 14:52.892
IT'S THE SAME.
HE'S THE SAME.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.284
GOOD. WHO'S NEXT?

14:54.284 --> 14:56.286
ANYONE HERE
WITH A REAL PROBLEM?

14:56.286 --> 14:57.940
Student:
PROFESSOR BEECH,
WHICH PROBLEM SETS...

14:57.940 --> 15:00.203
BUDDY, YOU'RE DOING
A GREAT JOB, YOU KNOW THAT?

15:00.203 --> 15:03.032
YOU'RE BEING A VERY,
VERY, VERY BIG HELP.

15:03.032 --> 15:07.254
YEAH. BIG HELP.

15:07.254 --> 15:11.214
SO, UH, AREN'T YOU
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL?

15:11.214 --> 15:12.302
HAVEN'T YOU
BEEN HERE A LONG TIME?

15:12.302 --> 15:15.262
SURE.
I'M GOING BACK.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.394
AS SOON AS
I ORGANIZE HER CLOTHES

15:17.394 --> 15:19.440
AND STERILIZE HER BOTTLES

15:19.440 --> 15:22.095
AND HANG UP THIS MOBILE,
WHEREVER IT GOES.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.923
AND, YOU KNOW,

15:23.923 --> 15:25.925
PAY SOME BILLS
THAT CHARLIE,
LIKE, TOTALLY MISSED.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.492
FIND DIANA'S CRIB SHEETS--

15:28.492 --> 15:30.930
OK, SO NOT TODAY.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.716
UH, NO. NOT TODAY.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.805
NOW WHERE'S THAT
BABY MONITOR?

15:36.805 --> 15:38.894
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.
WHERE...WHAT DID I DO--

15:39.982 --> 15:40.896
OH.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.900
OH...GOD...YOU'RE BOTH--

15:44.900 --> 15:46.597
YOU OK?

15:46.597 --> 15:50.514
UH...I'M--I'M FINE.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.260
JULE?

15:57.260 --> 15:58.261
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:58.261 --> 15:59.262
[CRYING]

15:59.262 --> 16:01.830
I'M JUST--I'M JUST--

16:01.830 --> 16:04.441
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
ANY LAUNDRY.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.490
I'M SORRY.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.840
WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M SORRY.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.365
OH, GOD.

16:15.365 --> 16:21.110
I'M SUCH
A WASTE OF OXYGEN AND
NUTRIENTS AND TUITION.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.330
CATCH ME UP HERE A LITTLE?

16:23.330 --> 16:29.684
UH...IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD, OK?

16:29.684 --> 16:32.556
AND IT'S JUST MY FIRST
GRADE AT STANFORD.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.081
IT'S THE FIRST LINE ON
MY BRAND NEW TRANSCRIPT

16:35.081 --> 16:38.388
AND IT'S
A STUPID INCOMPLETE.

16:38.388 --> 16:41.261
OH, MAN.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.698
AND YOU KNOW THE REASON
I'M DROPPING THE COURSE?

16:43.698 --> 16:46.570
IT'S NOT A DEATH
IN THE FAMILY,

16:46.570 --> 16:48.616
OR CANCER,
OR A PREMATURE BABY.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.009
IT'S JUST THIS--

16:50.009 --> 16:53.751
THIS STUPID
HORRIBLE THING THAT I--

16:55.188 --> 16:58.843
GOD, WHAT AM I--

16:58.843 --> 17:00.106
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.542
WHY NOT?

17:01.542 --> 17:04.197
'CAUSE I KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.764
YOU TOLD ME
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS,

17:06.764 --> 17:08.723
AND YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.943
AND IT'LL ONLY MAKE ME
FEEL WORSE, SO I--I CAN'T.

17:15.991 --> 17:19.342
Dr. Nampur:
MRS. SALINGER?

17:19.342 --> 17:20.735
TODAY'S YOUR DAY.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.606
YOU'RE FREE
TO GO HOME.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.434
JUST SIGN THIS FORM
AND YOUR INTERNIST
CAN RELEASE YOU.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.914
I'M FREE TO GO?

17:25.914 --> 17:27.437
YEAH. UNLESS
YOU DON'T FEEL READY.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.309
YOU CAN ALWAYS REQUEST
AN EXTRA DAY.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.876
NO. I MEAN, THAT'S OK.

17:31.876 --> 17:35.880
I MEAN,
I DON'T FEEL NOT READY.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.534
THANKS.

17:40.842 --> 17:43.149
ARE YOU--

17:43.149 --> 17:47.109
ARE YOU SURE THAT
WE SHOULDN'T KEEP YOUR
ROOM FOR AN EXTRA DAY?

17:47.109 --> 17:50.069
I MEAN...

17:50.069 --> 17:51.679
IF WE'RE GONNA
KEEP TRYING

17:51.679 --> 17:54.029
TO FEED DIANA
EVERY COUPLE HOURS...

17:54.029 --> 17:56.379
I MEAN, THERE'S A COT
FOR ME, BUT...

17:56.379 --> 17:57.554
DON'T YOU WANT
A DECENT PLACE TO SLEEP?

18:00.775 --> 18:03.908
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD
SLEEP AT HOME.

18:03.908 --> 18:08.043
BUT YOU WANT TO GET
BOUNCED BACK AND FORTH
IN A CAR 12 TIMES A DAY?

18:08.043 --> 18:11.046
WHEN YOUR STITCHES
AREN'T EVEN HEALED
UP YET?

18:11.046 --> 18:16.921
NO...BUT, UM, MAYBE...

18:16.921 --> 18:21.143
MAYBE YOU COULD HANDLE
SOME OF THE FEEDINGS
WITHOUT ME.

18:21.143 --> 18:26.409
'CAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY
NEED ME IF YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO BOTTLE FEED HER.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.808
WELL, THEN, UH...

18:33.808 --> 18:37.986
WHAT IF I STAYED?

18:37.986 --> 18:39.857
WOULD YOU FEEL BAD
IF I STAYED?

18:39.857 --> 18:42.208
NO. IT'S FINE.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.471
I MEAN, IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS, WE'LL CALL.

18:44.471 --> 18:48.605
BUT, I MEAN,
IF I GO HOME, IS THAT OK?

18:48.605 --> 18:55.134
SURE. AS LONG AS
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.875
YEAH.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.316
[SIGHS]

20:03.114 --> 20:05.378
ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING?

20:05.378 --> 20:06.857
UH-HUH.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.264
WHAT'S WRONG?

20:24.048 --> 20:25.702
I DON'T KNOW.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.965
I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST--

20:27.965 --> 20:29.228
ANOTHER LONG DAY?

20:31.752 --> 20:33.536
DO YOU REMEMBER

20:33.536 --> 20:36.974
WHEN YOU WANTED
TO GO TO OAKLAND
TO WATCH THE FIRES?

20:36.974 --> 20:40.239
AND I WAS SCARED
THAT A CINDER
WAS GONNA FALL ON ME

20:40.239 --> 20:42.502
AND SEND MY HAIR UP
IN FLAMES.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.287
AND YOU SAID
I WAS NUTS, YOU KNOW,

20:45.287 --> 20:48.638
'CAUSE WE WERE
GONNA BE WATCHING FROM
MILES AND MILES AWAY.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.292
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.816
I MEAN,
I WAS ABSOLUTELY NUTS.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.865
BUT, STILL,
IT WAS HOW I FELT.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.260
AND...

21:01.260 --> 21:03.523
THE IDEA OF SEX
RIGHT NOW...

21:05.394 --> 21:07.962
IT'S KIND OF
THE SAME AS THAT.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.094
WHAT, YOU'RE AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA CATCH ON FIRE?

21:10.094 --> 21:12.923
I'M SERIOUS, BAILEY.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.317
THIS IS SERIOUS.

21:15.317 --> 21:18.668
YOU KNOW, MAYBE--MAYBE
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

21:18.668 --> 21:21.671
BUT I CAN'T HELP
THINKING ABOUT,

21:21.671 --> 21:24.152
IF, GOD FORBID,
YOU KNOW,
I GOT PREGNANT,

21:24.152 --> 21:26.502
AND THE FATHER
WAS SOMEBODY WHO...

21:26.502 --> 21:29.853
YOU KNOW, REALLY
DIDN'T WANT TO BE...

21:29.853 --> 21:31.246
SARAH, YOU KNOW THAT--

21:31.246 --> 21:33.509
YEAH, I KNOW.
YOU WOULD SUPPORT ME.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.729
I KNOW THAT.

21:35.729 --> 21:38.558
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
REALLY WANT THAT BABY,
WOULD YOU?

21:38.558 --> 21:40.908
SO, BASICALLY,
I WOULD BE ALONE.

21:42.475 --> 21:45.521
I WOULD BE GOING
THROUGH ALL THAT ALONE.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.132
THAT'S SCARY.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.700
BAILEY, I MEAN,
THAT REALLY SCARES ME.

21:50.700 --> 21:54.835
YOU KNOW, IT MAKES ME
FEEL SO NOT-SAFE.

21:56.924 --> 22:00.188
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
SEX WITH YOU
IS REALLY UNSAFE.

22:12.461 --> 22:13.810
MR. SALINGER.

22:13.810 --> 22:14.724
HMM?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.466
WHAT?

34:57.486 --> 34:59.445
LISTEN, I FELT
THE SAME WAY MYSELF.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.577
BUT THEN SOMEBODY
HANDED ME THE BABY,

35:01.577 --> 35:03.623
AND, WHAM,
I HAD TO DEAL.

35:03.623 --> 35:06.016
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TAKE CARE OF HER,
CHARLIE!

35:06.016 --> 35:08.193
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT!

35:08.193 --> 35:10.412
THEN LEARN!
SHE'S YOUR KID, TOO.

35:10.412 --> 35:14.329
I CAN'T DO

35:14.329 --> 35:17.027
LOOK, IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG,
JUST CALL ME.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.813
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO DO THIS, DAPHNE, OK?

35:19.813 --> 35:22.207
CAN'T YOU SEE
I AM DESPERATE HERE?!

35:24.818 --> 35:26.994
OK. FINE.
I'LL CALL KIRSTEN.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.909
I'LL ASK HER
TO COME OVER.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.389
SHE'LL BE YOUR BACKUP.

35:38.962 --> 35:42.705
I'LL COME BY
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
TO PICK UP MAIL.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.968

I'LL JUST LEAVE THEM
ON THE MACHINE.

35:46.883 --> 35:51.366
YOU CAN CALL IN AND GET THEM
WHEN I'M NOT HERE, IF YOU WANT.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.805

I DON'T GET, BAILEY?

35:57.416 --> 35:58.808
IS THAT YOU WORK
REALLY HARD

35:58.808 --> 36:01.463

36:04.684 --> 36:07.861

THE APARTMENT...

36:07.861 --> 36:10.559

TO BE GROWN UP ABOUT,

36:10.559 --> 36:11.995
YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.738
AND THAT'S REALLY SAD,

'CAUSE OTHERWISE, BAILEY,
YOU COME SO CLOSE.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.853
WHY AREN'T YOU
BACK AT SCHOOL?

36:43.853 --> 36:45.768
DID YOU CALL THEM,

36:45.768 --> 36:47.422
AND THEY SAID YOU COULD
TAKE AN EXTRA WEEK
OR SOMETHING?

36:47.422 --> 36:49.250
WELL, TECHNICALLY...

36:49.250 --> 36:50.991

THIS IS SERIOUS.

36:54.647 --> 36:57.171

THE MONEY, BAILEY?

36:58.955 --> 37:00.305
I MEAN, COME ON.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.176
NO. I KNOW.
I KNOW HE NEEDS HELP.

37:02.176 --> 37:05.005
BUT DOES HE HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR SCHOOL?

37:05.005 --> 37:07.921
HAS HE ASKED YOU
WHEN YOU'RE GOING BACK?

37:07.921 --> 37:09.836
OF COURSE NOT.
I MEAN, HE HAS ENOUGH
TO WORRY ABOUT.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.533
EXACTLY.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

37:11.533 --> 37:14.014

WAY TOO MUCH
TO THINK ABOUT.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.799
AND IT'S GREAT THAT
YOU'RE WORRIED, CLAUD,

37:16.799 --> 37:18.061

IN SCHOOL.

37:20.107 --> 37:23.632

YOUR PLANE TICKET,
RIGHT?

37:23.632 --> 37:24.894
OK. WHY DON'T
YOU GET PACKED,

37:24.894 --> 37:26.461
AND I'LL CALL
THE AIRLINE,

37:26.461 --> 37:28.768
AND WE'LL GET YOU
ON A FLIGHT TODAY, OK?

37:41.607 --> 37:42.999
OK, I GET IT.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.830

WITH HIM, AND YOU'RE
GOING BACK TONIGHT.

37:47.830 --> 37:51.399

37:51.399 --> 37:53.923
BECAUSE YOU 2...

37:53.923 --> 37:56.796
ALL YOU DID WAS...

37:56.796 --> 37:59.451
YOU NEEDED EACH OTHER
TO GET AWAY FROM GRIFFIN
AND ME.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.801
AND YOU WANTED TO FEEL
ROMANTIC ABOUT IT,

38:01.801 --> 38:04.630
INSTEAD OF ALL SELFISH
OR GUILTY OR WHATEVER,

38:04.630 --> 38:07.894

38:21.560 --> 38:25.259

OF BEING FRIENDS,

38:25.259 --> 38:26.913

WHEN YOU CAN'T STAND NOT
BEING TOGETHER ANYMORE,

38:30.308 --> 38:33.180
YOU BREAK DOWN
AND YOU FALL IN LOVE.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.099
