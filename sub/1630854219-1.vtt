00:31.871 --> 00:33.739
Dad?

00:34.575 --> 00:37.736
I don't even know if
you're going to get this.

00:37.872 --> 00:40.404
I'm bringing
Lily to you.

00:40.539 --> 00:41.609
Erm.

00:44.149 --> 00:45.716
I hope you're OK

00:45.852 --> 00:47.545
It's the
blood, that's what draws them.

00:47.681 --> 00:48.949
It's
the blood, that's what draws
them. Mum's erm.

00:49.084 --> 00:50.252
They'll
track it, and kill you.

00:54.823 --> 00:57.994
I'll explain
when I see you

01:00.033 --> 01:01.568
See you soon.

01:01.703 --> 01:05.162
No one
is available to take your call.

01:05.297 --> 01:06.740
People are
dying out there

01:09.201 --> 01:10.741
Make sure
you don't bleed!

01:27.730 --> 01:29.123
Dear Mum

01:29.258 --> 01:31.092
I hope you're OK

01:31.662 --> 01:33.162
We've packed up what
we can carry

01:33.297 --> 01:35.668
and we're going to Dad's.

01:36.070 --> 01:37.804
Harry says the roads aren't safe

01:37.940 --> 01:40.097
so we're going to walk.

01:40.299 --> 01:42.499
It shouldn't take us more than
a couple of weeks

01:42.634 --> 01:44.473
If all goes well

02:35.628 --> 02:37.896
We're not doing this for home
work are we?

02:38.032 --> 02:39.727
Yea of course we are

02:39.862 --> 02:41.527
Oh look at that there,
the drawbridge

02:41.662 --> 02:43.833
Goes straight through

02:44.002 --> 02:44.964
Eh?

03:11.263 --> 03:13.762
You started this!

03:41.154 --> 03:43.530
What did you have for
food before?

03:43.666 --> 03:44.793
Tomatoes

03:45.327 --> 03:46.323
Tomatoes?

03:46.759 --> 03:48.401
Well we've got

03:49.738 --> 03:51.129
Beans

03:52.741 --> 03:54.165
Oh my god

03:54.710 --> 03:55.738
Beans

03:56.437 --> 03:57.475
Ooh

03:57.611 --> 03:59.406
I think I'll have to go
with the beans

03:59.542 --> 04:01.381
You chose correctly

04:10.289 --> 04:12.316
You taking a picture?

04:12.552 --> 04:13.591
You know

04:16.394 --> 04:17.694
You're such a weirdo

04:17.830 --> 04:21.897
It's so you can remember and
look back on it

04:22.333 --> 04:23.733
Right, come on

05:13.646 --> 05:15.018

05:15.153 --> 05:16.883

05:17.019 --> 05:18.150

05:18.286 --> 05:19.593

05:19.729 --> 05:20.856

05:20.992 --> 05:22.989
I'm begging you. shh,

You need to go. Get out,

05:23.990 --> 05:25.890
Please just help me!

05:26.026 --> 05:28.066
Please, just help me!

05:28.201 --> 05:29.398
Please.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.095
Just help me.

06:27.295 --> 06:29.362
Come here, you do that,
I'll do this,
come on go over there.

06:29.498 --> 06:30.625
I've done it,
I've done it!

06:30.761 --> 06:33.599
It's alright, come on

06:57.959 --> 06:58.783
Right

06:59.585 --> 07:03.258
There's no way,
we are going across this bridge

07:03.394 --> 07:04.598
Come on

07:04.733 --> 07:05.995
No, listen to me right, hang on.
I thought there was

07:06.130 --> 07:08.468
there is another bridge further
down. No house.

07:08.603 --> 07:10.103
That's the one we are going to,
alright?

07:10.238 --> 07:12.165
Come on, take a risk!

07:12.766 --> 07:14.134
Take a risk?

07:15.439 --> 07:16.305
Take a risk?

07:16.440 --> 07:17.944
What's in there?

07:18.079 --> 07:18.637
I don't know

07:18.773 --> 07:19.572
Right, exactly

07:19.708 --> 07:20.976
Take a risk?!

07:24.051 --> 07:25.311
Jesus

07:25.613 --> 07:26.651
Right

07:26.787 --> 07:29.448
If you listen to me we can
find another way

07:29.583 --> 07:32.650
So if we go further on,
it should be there alright?

07:32.785 --> 07:33.651
Yeah?

07:33.786 --> 07:34.825
Lily!

07:38.296 --> 07:39.260
Lily!

07:39.396 --> 07:40.325
Shit

09:49.693 --> 09:51.054
Get out!

09:51.356 --> 09:54.093
get out, get out, get out!

09:56.061 --> 09:57.398
Shit!

09:58.235 --> 10:01.939
Oh great,

10:43.845 --> 10:45.018
Come on

10:45.153 --> 10:46.214
What?

10:47.848 --> 10:48.715
Who's he?

10:48.850 --> 10:50.416
I don't know

11:05.169 --> 11:09.006
I don't think they'll be
following us now

11:10.805 --> 11:11.708
Custard?

11:11.843 --> 11:13.739
Do you realise what you did?

11:13.875 --> 11:14.913
Before?

11:15.515 --> 11:16.981
No, because you

11:17.649 --> 11:19.348
You never listen!

11:19.517 --> 11:20.545
Ever!

11:24.017 --> 11:25.759
Go to bed.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.604
You don't talk much, do you?

11:54.086 --> 11:57.120
I didn't know.
I'm I'm I'm sorry.

12:03.059 --> 12:05.557
Do you know sign language?

12:07.566 --> 12:08.934
Me neither

12:14.068 --> 12:15.776
What's your name?

12:19.841 --> 12:21.111
Matt?

12:23.108 --> 12:24.147

12:47.939 --> 12:50.976
not sure about the colour though

12:54.909 --> 12:55.948
This?

12:57.418 --> 12:58.282
Rubbish

Thank you

13:50.802 --> 13:52.169
Dear Mum

13:52.772 --> 13:54.569
Harry is doing good

13:54.805 --> 13:57.975
He keeps bossing me around
a bit, so there's nothing
new there

13:58.111 --> 14:01.179
I do think we make a pretty
good team

14:01.314 --> 14:06.018
My legs are aching,
but I'm excited to see dad again

14:15.355 --> 14:16.825
Could be food

14:16.961 --> 14:19.291

25:46.578 --> 25:48.746

25:48.881 --> 25:49.919
OK

26:18.383 --> 26:19.846
Get her out here

26:20.382 --> 26:23.617

bit Lily!

26:23.752 --> 26:25.486
Who's that?

26:25.622 --> 26:26.386
What's your name?

26:26.522 --> 26:27.385

26:53.085 --> 26:57.448
Don't take that off,
leave it covered up

27:02.026 --> 27:04.827
I've got a cabin
just up the road

27:04.963 --> 27:07.124
You can stay there for
a couple of days

27:07.259 --> 27:09.191
but after that, you're gone

27:09.326 --> 27:10.465
We will be, thank you

27:10.601 --> 27:11.862
No more lying

27:23.040 --> 27:24.079
Bye

27:29.581 --> 27:32.386
We need to pack up,
and we're leaving

27:32.522 --> 27:33.550
But why?

27:34.362 --> 27:35.827
We can't trust them!

27:35.963 --> 27:38.561
But It's safer with them than
it is out here

27:38.696 --> 27:40.132
Can you walk on that?

27:40.267 --> 27:41.393
Not really!

27:42.826 --> 27:45.530
Right the minute you can walk
back on that

27:45.665 --> 27:48.107
you tell me, and we're leaving.
Do you hear me?

27:48.242 --> 27:49.201
Yeah

27:49.337 --> 27:50.934
Get your stuff,
while I'm out here

27:59.017 --> 28:02.650

28:03.720 --> 28:10.191

Alright

28:38.525 --> 28:40.793
I got these for you

28:43.425 --> 28:45.731
Look, I don't want you getting
comfortable here

28:45.866 --> 28:48.858
You're gone as soon as
she's better, OK?

28:48.994 --> 28:50.000
Yeah

28:51.731 --> 28:55.130
Look, I'll I'll pay you back

We live up at that big
farm don't we Karl

29:07.112 --> 29:08.349
Yeah

29:08.485 --> 29:10.981
We can bring you some more
food tonight if you want?

29:36.148 --> 29:38.283
It's kinda hard to explain
like you have

29:38.418 --> 29:39.811
Yeah

29:39.947 --> 29:43.183
Erm, I'd have to put down
a one, or a king or a queen

29:43.319 --> 29:45.653
Shhhh

29:47.791 --> 29:48.458
Alright

29:48.593 --> 29:50.194
Alright?

29:50.330 --> 29:51.391
So

29:51.526 --> 29:52.790
Do you know how to play?
Erm, yeah

29:52.925 --> 29:54.226
Do you want to play cheat?
I've not a clue

29:54.361 --> 29:56.967
Oh, ey up, ey up
Ey!

29:57.103 --> 29:58.233
Not seen one of
them for ages

29:58.368 --> 29:59.934
I'll take all of these

30:00.069 --> 30:01.803
Teaching them to play cards?

30:01.938 --> 30:05.140
Yeah, I'm trying to teach
him to play cheat but he
won't listen!

30:05.275 --> 30:07.240
OK then, go on,
go, go, go!

30:07.376 --> 30:11.382
So, like, you say cheat,
if you think someone's lying
about what card they've put down

30:11.517 --> 30:13.344
Yeah

30:13.479 --> 30:16.445
So they have one card left
and ooh it happens to be
the right card that they need

30:16.581 --> 30:18.582
that's a king. Cheat! It's not

30:18.717 --> 30:24.157
they have to pick up all
the cards there are. OK I'll
deal us all in OK, OK

30:24.293 --> 30:25.696
Oh you're a star,
thank you

30:25.832 --> 30:26.899
Karl's played it before

30:27.034 --> 30:29.999

Go on then

30:37.641 --> 30:38.669

30:42.416 --> 30:45.747

30:45.882 --> 30:48.982
I'm just going to deal all
of the cards out and I'll

30:58.762 --> 31:00.394
It's fine

31:04.201 --> 31:06.831
I don't know how
they do it

31:06.966 --> 31:10.102
You know, I don't know
how they cope in this

31:10.238 --> 31:11.200
It's hard enough for us

31:12.441 --> 31:14.107
Yeah but kids are kids
aren't they

31:14.242 --> 31:16.305
They adapt easier than we do

31:16.441 --> 31:18.074
For us it's

31:18.209 --> 31:23.254
it's a struggle isn't it, but
she's handling it better than me

31:23.390 --> 31:24.288
Yeah

31:24.524 --> 31:25.518
Oh

31:26.220 --> 31:27.984
What's up in the farm?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.825

Harry was stressing me

35:33.974 --> 35:38.136
I'm alright though,
it just needs to heal enough to
stop bleeding

35:38.271 --> 35:42.705
We've met some other
survivors who have let us stay
in a cabin for a few days

35:42.840 --> 35:44.715
They seem pretty nice

35:44.851 --> 35:45.714

Alright?

45:57.893 --> 45:59.754
I'm alright, are you?

46:00.465 --> 46:01.723
Not bad

46:02.567 --> 46:04.264
Been for a stroll?

46:06.100 --> 46:07.997
Yeah, just for a look round

46:08.133 --> 46:09.841
Those trees there

46:16.811 --> 46:18.047
Leaving us?

46:20.418 --> 46:21.710
No

46:22.311 --> 46:24.185
No, found it

46:26.585 --> 46:28.292
It's funny what you
find isn't it?

46:28.427 --> 46:29.655
Yeah

46:29.891 --> 46:31.155
Anyway

46:31.291 --> 46:32.954
I'm going to pop round tonight

46:33.090 --> 46:33.960
OK?

46:34.096 --> 46:36.895
Er, tonight's not a great idea

46:37.398 --> 46:40.437
What do you mean not
a great idea?

46:40.773 --> 46:43.507
Well, Lily, she's got homework

46:43.642 --> 46:45.373
No school, no homework

46:45.509 --> 46:46.977
No point

47:02.262 --> 47:03.117
Lily

47:03.252 --> 47:04.223
What?

47:04.359 --> 47:06.328
Do you want to see
something cool?

47:06.464 --> 47:07.691
Yeah

47:08.027 --> 47:09.494
Come on

48:40.460 --> 48:41.918
Cool innit

48:42.087 --> 48:43.126
Yeah

48:45.394 --> 48:49.231

turn these off

49:27.497 --> 49:28.900
You ready Lil?

Harry's gone out again
while Karl is hunting

49:51.530 --> 49:55.360
He's insisting on finding
somewhere else for us to go

49:55.495 --> 49:58.058
I think we should
stay here

49:58.194 --> 50:02.700
Harry won't listen to me
though, will he?

51:19.242 --> 51:23.418
Wow, wow, wow, wow, OK, OK, OK,
alright, Jesus

51:26.959 --> 51:29.022
I just want some food, OK?

51:29.158 --> 51:31.129
That's all you want?

51:33.324 --> 51:34.363

Give me that

51:43.072 --> 51:44.406
Sit over there

51:51.608 --> 51:53.316
Both legs under

52:11.836 --> 52:13.534
Lily's favourite

52:15.906 --> 52:17.472
Who's Lily?

So where is she?

52:35.657 --> 52:39.254
It must be nice to have
someone with you

52:39.790 --> 52:42.426
It's alright, she's a pain

52:43.129 --> 52:46.897
Have you got anybody?
Was she with you?

52:47.032 --> 52:50.868
With me when?
In the tent

52:52.004 --> 52:53.234

55:36.066 --> 55:38.667
Me and Tom

tree fort in the woods

55:38.802 --> 55:42.238
I mean we already found it
there. Anyway it was really
cool. Erm

55:42.374 --> 55:47.447
but we've been making it really
big with like long branches we
found that are dead,
on the floor

55:47.582 --> 55:49.748
What are you doing?

55:49.884 --> 55:51.252

house, so it was really busy in
rush hour

59:23.897 --> 59:27.429
but there was plenty of kids to
play with and they were
always outside

59:27.565 --> 59:31.604
but I don't think they really
knew I existed

59:31.840 --> 59:35.741
So hopefully,
after my leg's healed,
we'll go find our dad, and then

59:35.877 --> 59:40.074

seen him in a while.

1:05:55.618 --> 1:05:57.859
You shouldn't be drinking!

1:05:57.995 --> 1:06:00.692
How many has she had?

1:06:00.961 --> 1:06:01.992
One

1:06:02.361 --> 1:06:04.859
Like she says, just the one

1:06:07.172 --> 1:06:09.363
Lily's had a tough day
today anyway

1:06:09.498 --> 1:06:10.601
Why what happened?

1:06:10.736 --> 1:06:12.471
Oh don't worry,
the kids are alright

1:06:12.606 --> 1:06:16.710
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine!

1:06:16.845 --> 1:06:18.205
Who was it?

1:06:18.407 --> 1:06:19.439
I don't know

1:06:19.741 --> 1:06:21.779
Where are they now?

1:06:21.915 --> 1:06:27.189
I don't know where they are,
but there's one missing. OK?

1:06:29.892 --> 1:06:31.259
Where were you?

1:06:39.463 --> 1:06:41.104
I was setting traps

1:06:44.334 --> 1:06:45.702
Animal traps

1:06:47.206 --> 1:06:48.705
Or other traps?

1:06:51.882 --> 1:06:52.912
They're for the infected

1:06:53.048 --> 1:06:53.915
They're your traps!

1:06:54.050 --> 1:06:54.912
Of course they're his traps!

1:06:55.047 --> 1:06:56.147
You what?

1:06:56.282 --> 1:06:58.018
Of course they're his

1:06:58.153 --> 1:06:59.185
who else are they going
to be? You're taking his
side over me now?

1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:00.387
That's why you're hurt!

1:07:00.522 --> 1:07:03.583
No! It's all of us against
them out there

1:07:03.718 --> 1:07:05.228
He's keeping them out!

1:07:05.363 --> 1:07:08.292
That's why you put mud,
and grass on them innit

1:07:08.427 --> 1:07:10.427
The infected can't see that

1:07:10.562 --> 1:07:13.532
It's for the survivors like us!

1:07:15.873 --> 1:07:18.372
Thank you Lily. Right?

1:07:19.441 --> 1:07:22.442
Now why didn't you
listen to her?

1:07:24.882 --> 1:07:27.044
But now you listen to me

1:07:27.313 --> 1:07:29.042
I put them traps down

1:07:29.711 --> 1:07:31.586
to keep anything out

1:07:32.089 --> 1:07:34.456
not just the fucking infected

1:07:34.591 --> 1:07:39.987
I want no one coming round here
and spoiling things, OK?

1:07:42.761 --> 1:07:46.062
Right you just take care
what you say

1:07:46.197 --> 1:07:47.302
Right?

1:07:47.437 --> 1:07:50.739
You're here because I'm allowing
you to be here

1:07:50.875 --> 1:07:52.773
For no other reason

1:07:53.543 --> 1:07:56.879
Just look after her.
Make sure she's alright

1:07:57.015 --> 1:07:59.710
do a nice little job shall you

1:08:04.985 --> 1:08:05.852

Get your arse down here

1:08:08.221 --> 1:08:09.588

1:08:23.873 --> 1:08:25.175
There

1:08:27.109 --> 1:08:28.009
It followed me

1:08:28.144 --> 1:08:29.942
You're fucking joking

1:08:31.877 --> 1:08:34.013
Look we're staying here
tonight. Tom

1:08:34.149 --> 1:08:36.109
switch the lights on

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:58.974
I wish I lived
somewhere like this

1:08:59.109 --> 1:09:00.701
yeah it's nice, innit?

1:09:00.837 --> 1:09:02.576
Yeah, it's really cool

1:09:02.712 --> 1:09:05.513
There's a river the other
side of the forest

1:09:05.649 --> 1:09:07.475
I could teach you how to
fish if you'd like?

1:09:07.611 --> 1:09:09.681
Yeah, sounds good

1:09:09.816 --> 1:09:14.954
Yeah, my Dad he got me
a fishing rod last year,
but Karl won't let me go near
the river

1:09:15.089 --> 1:09:16.191
What?

1:09:16.327 --> 1:09:18.853
Yeah,
apparently it's unsafe

1:09:18.989 --> 1:09:20.863
No,
so Karl's not your Dad?

1:09:20.998 --> 1:09:24.024
No, he's not my Dad

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.700
So, who is he then?
Do you know him?

1:09:26.836 --> 1:09:29.869
No, Mum just let him stay
when the virus got bad

1:09:30.004 --> 1:09:31.468
Oh

1:09:31.603 --> 1:09:33.241
Where's your Mum now?

1:09:33.377 --> 1:09:37.671
Oh well, Mum,
Mum, Mum died

1:09:37.806 --> 1:09:39.911
What happened?

1:09:40.046 --> 1:09:44.853
She died just after Karl
got here. She was stabbed

1:09:44.989 --> 1:09:46.922
What? By who?

1:09:47.058 --> 1:09:48.784
The, The infected

1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:50.520
I didn't know
they did that

1:09:50.656 --> 1:09:53.362
Yeah well, I don't know

1:09:53.831 --> 1:09:55.062
Sorry

1:09:55.698 --> 1:09:58.798
Either way,

1:09:58.933 --> 1:10:07.402

a few different types,
I've seen that you can catch,
erm there's trout

1:11:36.561 --> 1:11:38.027

1:11:41.169 --> 1:11:42.636

1:11:55.217 --> 1:11:56.848
What you up to?

1:11:57.946 --> 1:11:59.752
Where are the kids?

1:12:05.793 --> 1:12:08.926
I see you've got that
coat I got you

1:12:10.125 --> 1:12:12.395
What have you got that on for?

1:12:14.729 --> 1:12:15.867
Harry

1:12:17.601 --> 1:12:19.200
Are you alright?

1:12:24.445 --> 1:12:25.475
Where's Tom and Lily?

1:12:25.611 --> 1:12:27.213
They're safe

1:12:27.349 --> 1:12:31.379
What do you mean they're
safe? I said
they're safe

1:12:31.515 --> 1:12:32.818
Tom!

1:12:33.616 --> 1:12:35.018

1:12:38.824 --> 1:12:40.192
What do you mean safe?

1:12:40.328 --> 1:12:41.531
I said

1:12:41.666 --> 1:12:43.622

What have you done Harry?

1:12:43.758 --> 1:12:45.198

1:12:45.334 --> 1:12:47.470
Tom, get your arse here!

1:12:48.763 --> 1:12:50.231
Lily!

1:12:54.241 --> 1:12:55.577
Harry

1:12:56.445 --> 1:12:58.910

1:13:00.017 --> 1:13:01.043
Ey?

1:13:01.179 --> 1:13:03.382
What the fuck?

1:13:03.518 --> 1:13:04.485
I'm sorry Karl!

1:13:04.621 --> 1:13:07.787
What the fuck

1:13:08.618 --> 1:13:10.124
Harry!

1:13:12.261 --> 1:13:14.057
Tom! Lily!

1:13:59.807 --> 1:14:03.106

fucking hammer?

1:15:54.616 --> 1:16:00.455
are seeing
a near vertical trajectory, with
new patients being turned away

1:16:00.590 --> 1:16:07.226
Hazmat supplies are completely
depleted,
with hospital staff now being
asked to work without them

1:16:07.361 --> 1:16:10.829
protected by a vaccine they all
know doesn't work

1:16:10.965 --> 1:16:13.501
The Prime minister is due to
make an announcement shortly

1:16:13.636 --> 1:16:18.344
but with
the military already enforcing
nationwide martial law,
it is not clear

1:16:37.124 --> 1:16:37.793
Mum?

1:16:40.733 --> 1:16:42.336
Harry?

1:16:42.472 --> 1:16:44.163
Harry, where's Mum?

1:16:44.299 --> 1:16:46.241
Everything is OK just stay
there, OK? Just stay there

1:16:46.377 --> 1:16:47.601
Harry can I see Mum?

1:16:47.737 --> 1:16:49.477
She's alright just listen to me
and go downstairs!

1:16:49.612 --> 1:16:51.176
Harry, I want to see my Mum

1:16:51.311 --> 1:16:53.646
She's not feeling well, alright?
Just listen to me!

1:16:53.781 --> 1:16:56.347
I'm not going downstairs
Go downstairs just

1:16:56.482 --> 1:16:59.320

Everything's going to be
alright, everything's going to
be alright

1:16:59.456 --> 1:17:01.021
No! I want to see my Mum

1:17:01.156 --> 1:17:04.654
I'm begging you, please,
Mum's not feeling well OK?

1:17:30.517 --> 1:17:32.015
Alright?

1:17:32.150 --> 1:17:33.518
Yeah
Yeah?

1:17:33.654 --> 1:17:35.923
Right, listen

1:17:36.659 --> 1:17:39.555
I'll leave the bag here

1:17:39.691 --> 1:17:41.856
I'm going to find the other
one's round there, alright?

1:17:41.991 --> 1:17:43.861
Two minutes

1:17:43.997 --> 1:17:47.334
That's it. Stay here. Alright?

1:17:47.469 --> 1:17:49.299
Don't leave!

1:18:20.405 --> 1:18:22.466
Hey, you alright?

1:18:22.602 --> 1:18:23.872
Yeah

1:18:29.972 --> 1:18:34.217
There'll be loads of fish in
this lake, like absolutely loads

1:18:34.352 --> 1:18:35.710
How big?

1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:39.754
This big? 80lbs?
Woah

1:18:39.889 --> 1:18:41.118
How long would that take
us to eat?

1:18:41.254 --> 1:18:43.386
80lbs would be
about this big

1:18:43.522 --> 1:18:48.389
We'd be catching,
I'd be catching ones about that
size for like tea and stuff,
like fillet it

1:18:48.525 --> 1:18:50.526
Well how long would
that last us?

1:18:50.661 --> 1:18:53.400
What, a big one?
Like this big? Yeah

1:18:53.535 --> 1:18:55.532
No, this big

1:18:55.668 --> 1:18:57.664
Two days

1:18:57.799 --> 1:19:00.403
That's not too bad
One week. Two days

1:19:00.538 --> 1:19:04.476
Three days, Four days,
Five days, One week

1:19:04.611 --> 1:19:06.244
OK

1:19:14.085 --> 1:19:16.925
Did Harry kill Karl?

1:19:18.252 --> 1:19:20.588
I don't know

1:19:22.963 --> 1:19:25.596
That's what happened to Mum

1:19:26.499 --> 1:19:30.565
I thought you said the infected
killed her?

1:19:31.066 --> 1:19:32.606
Na

1:19:32.742 --> 1:19:35.003
She got infected, and then

1:19:35.139 --> 1:19:37.913
And then Karl killed her

1:19:39.647 --> 1:19:41.310
I'm so sorry

1:19:41.446 --> 1:19:44.744
Yeah it's fine it's
ages back now

1:19:45.817 --> 1:19:46.919
Oi  guys

1:19:47.054 --> 1:19:50.321
Yeah?

1:20:26.793 --> 1:20:28.821
Hang on

1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:38.732
Hey guys, come on, come on

1:20:42.205 --> 1:20:43.910
What do you think?

1:20:44.045 --> 1:20:45.546
Awesome
Yeah

1:20:45.681 --> 1:20:47.840
Right, two secs

1:20:49.148 --> 1:20:51.415
Stay there, you

1:21:18.241 --> 1:21:20.213
Give me the bag

1:21:23.421 --> 1:21:25.251
Stay there

1:21:38.668 --> 1:21:40.460
Dear Mum

1:21:40.595 --> 1:21:42.403
We managed to find a boat

1:21:42.538 --> 1:21:45.370
We're going to see how
far it will get us up river

1:21:45.505 --> 1:21:48.142
Tom is with us now,
which is cool

1:21:48.278 --> 1:21:51.646
He says he can catch us
plenty to eat

1:21:51.782 --> 1:21:53.575
Harry is doing good

1:21:53.710 --> 1:21:56.414
Still bossy,
but that's fine

1:21:56.549 --> 1:21:59.417
He seems excited to be
moving again

1:21:59.552 --> 1:22:02.324
He's keeping the team
together well

1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:06.186
I hope you're watching
down on us, and feeling proud

1:22:06.322 --> 1:22:08.320
I miss you

1:22:08.456 --> 1:22:10.329
Love, Lily
