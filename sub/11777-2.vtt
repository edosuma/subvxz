08:38.601 --> 08:41.270
You didn't really
capture that texture.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.355
Tray,
tell US why you picked

08:42.438 --> 08:44.065
this spot here
out of all these areas.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.234
I just liked the blue,

08:46.317 --> 08:47.235
and how it crossed
through her hair and stuff.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.444
I think you did
a really good job

08:48.527 --> 08:50.571
matching the gray
to the wall.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.865
Not as good of a job
matching the blue.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.660
Mark.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.869
I just picked
a spot where I knew

08:56.953 --> 08:58.454
I could get
the complete coverage.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.330
You pretty much
just sprayed her gray.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.291
Not so much
on the Ingenuity side.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.460
Jess.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.295
This is not really
hiding into the wall.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.130
The bottom of her legs
aren't really painted,

09:08.214 --> 09:09.882
hair is showing through
in a lot of spots.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.509
I'd say
it's bottom of the pack.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.345
{\an5}-Sebastian.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.345
-A lot of attention to detail.

09:14.428 --> 09:15.638
This is really
what separated

09:15.721 --> 09:17.765
you guys that did the pits
and everything

09:17.848 --> 09:19.016
in the wall,
the cracks and all that,

09:19.100 --> 09:20.643
versus the guys
who just laid it in.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.145
Trying to do something
a little different.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.689
Jamie. You did
a good job of matching

09:24.772 --> 09:25.481
the color
on the bottom half.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.984
But on the top half,
that gray

09:28.067 --> 09:30.861
looks a lot darker on her
than it is on that wall.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.196
That whole [bleep] wall
is easy.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.531
There is nothing over there

09:33.614 --> 09:34.657
but gray,
white, and black.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.994
You guys all kind of
stuck together in a pack,

09:38.077 --> 09:39.829
so there's not
a lot of variations.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.080
That's a disadvantage
of everybody

09:41.163 --> 09:42.832
piled up
into one small area.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.336
Sarah, I really love
what you did

09:47.420 --> 09:48.671
with the airbrush,
especially right here

09:48.754 --> 09:50.965
in the midsection.
It's three dimensions.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.509
The texture in the legs
looks good too.

09:53.592 --> 09:54.343
Thank you, guys.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.095
TJ, why'd you have her

09:56.178 --> 09:57.680
put her hand on her head
like that?

09:57.763 --> 09:58.639
I wanted to do something
to complicate it.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.267
The color matches up well.
You had to mix

10:01.350 --> 10:01.892
{\an5}-all these colors, correct?

10:01.350 --> 10:01.892
-Oh, yeah.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.936
Mike.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.771
If you guys could just
squat down a little bit,

10:05.855 --> 10:06.856
everything will probably
line up a little better.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.566
I think you did a good job
choosing this spot.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.444
You were able
to blend the colors to match.

10:11.527 --> 10:12.903
I feel like your own name
in there might have

10:12.987 --> 10:14.864
{\an5}-thrown it off a little bit.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.864
-Aw.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.657
{\an5}-Kay Kutta.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.657
-I wasn't sure

10:16.741 --> 10:18.117
what angle
y'all was gonna judge from,

10:18.200 --> 10:19.744
so I designed
from three angles.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.871
You did both waves
of the tire treads.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.581
You also really
played with

10:23.664 --> 10:26.500
the three-dimensional space
and the depth of field.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.461
Putting that tire
in there was a great call.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.546
{\an5}-Steve.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.546
-The color of her lower legs

10:30.629 --> 10:32.798
and the color of the wall,
that looks like

10:32.882 --> 10:35.926
a hard color to match up,
so it's a little off.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.011
But, man, that texture
is the jam.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.971
Thanks.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.723
Tatu Baby.
The color of the door,

10:40.806 --> 10:44.435
being that gray metal, and
all the straight lines across

10:44.518 --> 10:46.228
make it that much harder,

10:46.312 --> 10:48.022
but it still
came out pretty good.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.274
Nick.
Smart move with the placement.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.984
I knew people were gonna
try to hide in graffiti.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.444
I just wanted
to do something different.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.653
The shadows definitely
played to your advantage,

10:54.737 --> 10:57.490
and the line across
the center of her torso

10:57.573 --> 10:59.575
is a really nice touch,
because it catches that

10:59.658 --> 11:01.911
whole separation in the brick.
Good job.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.412
It's weak.
He's relying, like,

11:03.496 --> 11:05.664
{\an5}-30-40 percent on the bushes.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.664
-Yeah.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.875
It's too easy to make her
disappear behind a [bleep] bush.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.460
Cop out.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.129
Clint, you picked
a very unusual space here.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.381
Everybody seems
to have something

11:13.464 --> 11:14.632
pretty easy to do,
as far as a flat surface goes,

11:14.715 --> 11:16.467
so I should get brownie points
for the fact

11:16.550 --> 11:19.220
that I picked
a really hard spot.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.554
The only thing
that gets me is

11:20.638 --> 11:22.681
the cracks on her upper body
stand apart from the wall

11:22.765 --> 11:24.725
as opposed to
blending into the wall.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.311
{\an8}[Bleep] them.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.729
I'm pissed.
I think I should have at least

11:28.813 --> 11:29.438
gotten some recognition
for the fact

11:29.522 --> 11:30.439
that I tried
to do something

11:30.523 --> 11:33.025
that nobody else
tried to do.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.276
As far as
I'm concerned,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.445
there's a clear winner,
and there's a clear loser.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.279
Mark took
the easy way out.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.532
We're here to compete.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.284
On that level, I think
Clint really tried hard,

11:42.368 --> 11:43.661
and I like
his competitiveness.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.537
Did something different.
So did Kay Kutta.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.123
{\an5}-Kay used the tire print.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.123
-Yeah.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.416
It wasn't just
this concrete pitted look

11:48.499 --> 11:50.543
{\an5}-that everybody did.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.543
-Yeah.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.460
However, who killed
the concrete pitted look

11:51.544 --> 11:53.879
{\an5}-in your guys' minds?

11:51.544 --> 11:53.879
-Steve.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.464
Technically, Steve
got that flaking paint,

11:55.548 --> 11:58.426
decomposing colors
down good.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.719
But in terms of Ingenuity
and a cool space,

12:00.803 --> 12:02.555
I don't know that
he went that overboard.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.306
Nick did
a really great job,

12:04.390 --> 12:06.142
but it's difficult
to get a sense

12:06.225 --> 12:07.643
of his technical skills,
'cause she was so hidden.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.062
TJ did a good job.
He hit the hole.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.689
That black hole on her leg?
Putting her in front of

12:11.772 --> 12:13.149
that hole
was a good idea.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.108
So it sounds like
we have a winner here

12:14.191 --> 12:15.651
{\an5}-for the Flash Challenge.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.651
-For sure.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.445
{\an5}-I think so.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.445
-Let's go let 'em know.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.488
For this
Flash Challenge,

12:19.572 --> 12:21.282
we tested your Ingenuity.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.616
Some of you impressed US.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.244
Steve, the way
you hit the texture.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.913
It wasn't too outlined,
it wasn't too soft.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.498
Kay, I really liked
the position

12:29.582 --> 12:30.708
that you put the model in.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.334
Nick, I thought
you did a great job

12:32.418 --> 12:33.836
making use
of the environment.

12:33.919 --> 12:37.590
As you know, there can only
be one winner here.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.675
The judges have
come to a decision.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.595
And the winner of
the Flash Challenge is...

12:43.220 --> 12:45.473
Kay Kutta.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.353
The one thing
that nobody else did,

12:51.437 --> 12:54.190
is you looked at your canvas
from different angles.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.233
She literally
was gone, man.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.235
Congratulations, Kay.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.653
It feels great
to win this Flash Challenge.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.323
It's definitely
a step toward my redemption.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.033
{\an8}Team Kutta!

13:04.116 --> 13:06.911
Not only will you select
your own human canvas,

13:06.994 --> 13:08.787
you'll also have
the power to assign

13:08.871 --> 13:10.664
everyone else's human canvas.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.541
I'm so mad right now,
I'm seeing red.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.376
{\an8}I think
I should have won.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.252
Head on back to the shop,

13:15.336 --> 13:16.962
and get ready
to meet your canvases

13:17.046 --> 13:18.380
for the next
Elimination Tattoo.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.133
So damn mad right now!

13:26.639 --> 13:27.515
Hmm.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.517
Wow.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.602
Yeah, look at him.
He's hurting.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.729
Back pain
is the worst, man.

13:33.812 --> 13:34.855
What's up
with TJ's back?

13:34.939 --> 13:35.606
He's been in the war.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.359
That's how
he got his injury.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.276
{\an5}-Got blown up in a damn tank.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.276
-Ugh.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.071
I've never felt pain
like this before.

13:42.154 --> 13:45.115
{\an8}It's extreme, it's sharp,
it's shooting down my legs.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.909
I can't handle the pain anymore.
It's unbearable.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.204
My legs are shaking,
trying to keep me upright.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.122
I just need to get some help.

13:52.206 --> 13:56.627
[sirens wailing]

13:57.836 --> 13:59.922
{\an8}I'm about to blast
a few people right now.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.424
{\an8}I just got the stupidest
tattoo on the planet.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.426
Kay [bleep] me.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.427
This is the tattoo
that can send me home.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.972
It's just not possible.
This [bleep] guy...

14:09.265 --> 14:14.562
[siren wailing]

14:14.645 --> 14:15.729
I just came back
from the hospital.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.773
They want to put rods
in my back.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.316
'Cause during
the Flash Challenge,

14:19.400 --> 14:20.776
I slipped another disc
in my back.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.612
I was bending down,
painting, and I just

14:23.696 --> 14:25.698
{\an5}-twisted wrong and felt it. Ah!

14:23.696 --> 14:25.698
-[grunts]

14:25.781 --> 14:28.784
My biggest fear is,
am I hurting my chances

14:28.867 --> 14:30.119
to be able to walk.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.162
{\an8}Am I damaging my back
to a point where

14:32.246 --> 14:33.956
{\an8}I'm not gonna be able
to do anything?

14:35.040 --> 14:35.833
For me, personally,

14:35.916 --> 14:36.875
until I bleed out, man,

14:36.959 --> 14:38.919
just keep fighting.
You obviously know.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.212
You're the [bleep] soldier,
you know?

14:40.296 --> 14:41.463
Dude, that's
the hardest part, man.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.132
I don't come from somebody
that just rolls over.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.217
But, dude,
it's just shooting.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.635
So [bleep] what?
You're a tattoo artist.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.596
{\an5}-Yeah.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.596
-This is what you do.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.347
I never lose.
I get what I want.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.890
I work my ass off.

14:51.974 --> 14:55.853
I do things to get them done.
I don't fail.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.939
And this, right now,
seems like a failure.

15:01.275 --> 15:05.279
{\an8}[tattoo machine buzzing]

15:10.826 --> 15:13.120
Welcome to this week's
Elimination Tattoo.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.165
Impress us, and you'll be
that much closer to $100,000

15:16.248 --> 15:18.292
and the title of <i> Ink Master.</i>

15:18.375 --> 15:20.044
Screw it up, and one of you

15:20.127 --> 15:20.628
will be packing
up your machines

15:20.711 --> 15:22.921
and closing up shop.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.340
Hey, Dave,
can I say something, man?

15:24.423 --> 15:26.216
What's up, man?

15:26.300 --> 15:27.926
Um, during
the Flash Challenge

15:28.010 --> 15:29.678
I tweaked my back really bad.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.013
I have
a previous back injury

15:31.096 --> 15:32.640
from when I was
in the military.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.641
They took me to the hospital,
and the doc thinks

15:33.724 --> 15:36.185
that I slipped another disc...

15:36.268 --> 15:37.645
{\an5}-Damn, dude.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.645
-And she thinks I could be

15:37.728 --> 15:38.687
doing permanent damage

15:38.771 --> 15:41.523
if I'm not able
to rest and recover.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.150
And I got a family
and a business

15:43.233 --> 15:45.027
and a career
to think about, man, and...

15:45.110 --> 15:47.780
I'm gonna have to withdraw
from the competition.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.408
Seriously, you're out?

15:51.492 --> 15:52.701
{\an5}-Yeah, man, I'm--I'm dying.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.701
-Aw, dude.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.703
Like, sitting there
is killing me.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.497
Okay, I understand.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.331
{\an5}-Thank you so much.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.331
-Good luck, buddy.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.332
{\an5}-I appreciate it.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.332
-Take it easy.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.292
Chris, thank you, man.
Oliver, thanks, man.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.669
{\an8}The last thing you expect

16:01.752 --> 16:03.962
is somebody to quit
on the second challenge.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.214
Another one bites the dust.

16:05.297 --> 16:05.714
Hey, thank you, guys.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.508
If he goes on,

16:07.591 --> 16:09.051
he could possibly
end his tattooing career,

16:09.134 --> 16:10.386
so I think he's making
the right choice.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.553
{\an5}-Thanks.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.553
-Fantastic.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.181
You're gonna pack your bags,
and you're gonna go home.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.182
{\an8}That's one less person
to worry about.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.647
That really sucks for TJ.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.107
One less competitor
for you guys.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.318
Which brings US to tonight's
Elimination Tattoo.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.070
This week, we're testing
your Ingenuity.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.614
That's the ability
to be cleverly inventive

16:30.698 --> 16:32.157
and resourceful.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.409
This season,
you'll also be judged

16:33.492 --> 16:36.704
by the most unforgiving critic
of all-- America.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.247
Each week,
viewers at home

16:38.330 --> 16:40.749
will scour every detail
of your Elimination Tattoos,

16:40.833 --> 16:43.419
at inkmaster.spike.com.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.795
Then they will vote
for the tattoo

16:44.878 --> 16:45.879
they think is the best

16:45.963 --> 16:49.508
using the same criteria
that the judges use.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.593
Today, we have
a very special guest judge.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.430
He's an NFL all-pro linebacker
for the Baltimore ravens.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.598
Terrell Suggs.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.766
{\an5}-[cheers and applause]

16:56.682 --> 16:57.766
-What?

16:57.850 --> 17:03.605
{\an5}-Whoo!

16:57.850 --> 17:03.605
-Oh... my god!

17:03.689 --> 17:06.191
{\an8}I have great
appreciation for body art.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.777
As a football player,
we love tattoos.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.281
You turn on any television
on Sunday, you'll see

17:12.364 --> 17:14.907
tons of tattoos
out there on the field.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.077
{\an5}-Ahh.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.077
-Ladies and gentlemen.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.412
{\an5}-You beast.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.412
-What up with it?

17:18.494 --> 17:19.913
{\an5}-What up with it?

17:18.494 --> 17:19.913
-Here he is.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.457
I can't believe this.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.708
Hey, Terrell,
thanks for coming, man.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.167
{\an5}-Thank you, bro.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.167
-So you got your first tattoo

17:24.251 --> 17:25.961
{\an5}-at sixteen.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.961
-Sixteen.

17:26.044 --> 17:26.627
Got a pit bull right there
on the chest.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.755
Are you happy with it?

17:27.838 --> 17:30.007
If I could do it again,
you know,

17:30.090 --> 17:32.551
it is over my heart,
so I probably would get my mom.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.262
Well, that brings US to
this week's Elimination Tattoo,

17:35.345 --> 17:36.513
Cover-Ups.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.476
In order to do a Cover-Up

17:40.559 --> 17:42.519
{\an8}that's good enough
to not be seen,

17:42.603 --> 17:45.063
you have to figure
out what colors to use,

17:45.147 --> 17:47.316
instead of just
putting a big black spot.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.777
A Cover-Up is one of
the most difficult tattoos.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.153
Not only do you
have to create a design

17:51.236 --> 17:52.070
that your client
will be happy with,

17:52.154 --> 17:53.989
but you have to do it
on top of one

17:54.072 --> 17:56.241
that they're definitely
not happy with.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.242
[exhales]

17:57.326 --> 17:58.660
Time to meet your canvases.

18:04.708 --> 18:05.793
Welcome, canvases.

18:05.876 --> 18:06.627
Why don't you go ahead
and show us

18:06.710 --> 18:08.837
the tattoos
you want covered up.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.672
We have some unwanted
tramp stamps,

18:10.756 --> 18:13.091
a unicorn, some tribal,
and a lot more.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.138
That one's nasty.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.766
Kay Kutta, because you
won the Flash Challenge,

18:20.849 --> 18:23.310
you now have the power to assign
all the human canvases.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.231
There's so many people
to shoot at,

18:27.314 --> 18:28.440
{\an8}I'm trying to
save some bullets,

18:28.524 --> 18:30.150
{\an8}but I'm about to blast
a few people right now.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.235
I'm just gonna
approach y'all.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.111
Just show me the tattoo
you want covered up.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.404
Let me see it.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.989
Kay Kutta
is the least-experienced

18:36.073 --> 18:37.199
{\an8}of all us tattoo artists.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.867
He'd better have
a strategy.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.410
You got an idea
what you wanna get?

18:40.494 --> 18:41.453
A large beach scene,

18:41.537 --> 18:43.372
{\an5}-like the sand, and the ocean.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.372
-[laughs]

18:43.455 --> 18:45.124
{\an5}-Is that right?

18:43.455 --> 18:45.124
-That is right.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.043
What you wanna get?

18:48.126 --> 18:50.003
{\an5}-You got idea?

18:48.126 --> 18:50.003
-Yeah, a friendly pit bull.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.922
Steve just won
an elimination challenge,

18:52.005 --> 18:53.549
so I'm looking for the most
[bleep] canvas out there

18:53.632 --> 18:54.842
to give to him.

18:54.925 --> 18:55.217
{\an8}'Cause I just want him
to shut up and go home.

18:57.135 --> 18:57.886
I'm gonna have
a target on my back.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.055
{\an8}I'm one of
the top guys here.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.431
Bring it on, man.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.809
{\an5}-You have to come after me.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.809
-There you go.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.894
You're nervous.
I would be if I was you.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.939
Canvases, one by one,
please read the artist's name

19:09.022 --> 19:10.357
on the bottom
of your skull.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.026
Sebastian?

19:13.110 --> 19:14.736
{\an5}-Yeah.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.736
-Can't wait to see that beach

19:14.820 --> 19:15.821
over all that black.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.991
I have no idea what,

19:19.074 --> 19:22.703
{\an8}on a realistic beach,
could cover a solid black sun.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.621
He can kiss my ass.

19:25.998 --> 19:26.999
Clint.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.917
Mark.

19:29.918 --> 19:30.919
Nick.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.630
"Big Daddy" Tray.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.090
{\an5}-Right here, man.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.090
-Tatu Baby?

19:36.675 --> 19:37.926
Lalo.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.803
Kay gave me
a difficult tattoo

19:39.887 --> 19:41.513
{\an8}because he wants to
get me out of the way.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.140
This is where
he's gonna [bleep] me.

19:43.223 --> 19:43.265
Jamie.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.518
Kay Kutta.

19:47.561 --> 19:48.729
Ron.

19:49.646 --> 19:50.772
Mike.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.524
Sarah.

19:54.234 --> 19:54.401
Jesse.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.613
Steve.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.780
Kay [bleep] Me.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.781
{\an8}In my professional life,

19:59.865 --> 20:01.950
I would never touch this
in a million years.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.453
It's a [bleep] nightmare.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.123
Artists, you have
the rest of the evening

20:08.206 --> 20:09.082
to consult
with your human canvas.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.085
Tomorrow,
you'll have six hours

20:12.169 --> 20:13.462
to complete
your tattoo.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.630
Based on your work,

20:14.713 --> 20:17.799
one of you will have to
close up shop and go home.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.302
Good luck.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.721
Cover-Ups are more
difficult right off the bat,

20:22.804 --> 20:24.765
{\an8}'cause you have to take
into account the tattoo

20:24.848 --> 20:26.516
that is already there.
How can you cover it?

20:26.600 --> 20:30.479
Build a design that will
work right over the top of it.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.522
I'm no stranger
to pit bull tattoos...

20:32.606 --> 20:33.732
{\an5}-That's-- that's great.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.732
-You know?

20:33.815 --> 20:36.193
{\an8}I feel like I got
the short end of the stick.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.028
A black dog,
with something like that.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.071
Yeah, yeah.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.114
Well, this test
is about Ingenuity,

20:41.198 --> 20:42.783
and there's not much Ingenuity
in slapping a black dog

20:42.866 --> 20:45.744
on top of a black tattoo.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.621
It's gonna be rough
this week.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.500
My job is obviously
to give you what you want,

20:51.583 --> 20:53.251
but you're gonna have
a cross going into your armpit.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.922
{\an8}He has your everyday idea
of a dragon

20:57.005 --> 20:58.048
{\an8}wrapped around a Celtic cross,

20:58.131 --> 20:59.883
{\an8}which isn't exactly
what I want to do.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.176
You know, I wanted to have
a cool transition, but that

21:01.259 --> 21:02.386
{\an5}-obviously not gonna work...

21:01.259 --> 21:02.386
-No, no.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.679
If we're gonna have a cross.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.556
I just got dealt the stupidest
damn tattoo on the planet.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.599
You can do one of two things.
Either "A," you can just

21:07.683 --> 21:09.518
go ahead and screw me
out of the competition,

21:09.601 --> 21:12.562
and let me do the best I can
with your cross idea--

21:12.646 --> 21:14.106
I'm gonna have this
forever, so--

21:14.189 --> 21:15.357
and you're getting it
for free.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.150
I want to show the judges
the Ingenuity,

21:17.234 --> 21:18.360
but he wants
certain elements,

21:18.443 --> 21:19.778
and he's not gonna
come off of that.

21:19.861 --> 21:23.073
Another guy that's just
not gonna [bleep] work with me.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.451
What's gonna happen
with this, it's so black,

21:26.535 --> 21:29.496
the lines are thick,
they're not light at all.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.873
{\an5}-It-- it's not possible.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.873
-Okay, okay.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.875
I'm telling you straight up,
this can't be covered.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.961
I'm sorry, believe me.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.337
You know, I got 100,000
on the line, and, um...

21:37.421 --> 21:39.381
I know, and I'm sorry,
for you.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.675
{\an8}I am so screwed right now.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.926
I'm gonna have to live with this
for the rest of my life.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.095
I get that you're competing,

21:45.178 --> 21:47.431
but this is my life too.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.057
{\an5}-This is just--

21:47.514 --> 21:49.057
-[clicks tongue]

21:49.141 --> 21:51.226
This tattoo could
cost me $100,000.

21:51.309 --> 21:53.854
{\an8}This is the tattoo
that can send me home.

21:53.937 --> 21:54.396
Hmm.

22:02.612 --> 22:03.780
I'm just worried
about finishing it.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.115
I think I can cover it,

22:05.198 --> 22:06.491
I just don't know
if I can finish it.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.327
I don't want to go home
yet. And I'm not going home

22:09.411 --> 22:10.912
{\an8}because I can't pull
off a tattoo.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.372
I think Kay's doing me a favor
by giving me a hard piece.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.916
{\an5}-I'm gonna nail it.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.916
-This is gonna be

22:15.000 --> 22:15.751
{\an5}-an interesting challenge.

22:15.000 --> 22:15.751
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.252
Steve, being the man
at the top,

22:17.336 --> 22:18.587
{\an8}there's a price to pay
for that.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.964
This is gonna be a really
fun-filled, stressful day.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.593
For today's
Elimination Tattoo,

22:24.676 --> 22:28.847
we're testing your Ingenuity
by tattooing a Cover-Up.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.641
You have six hours,
and your time...

22:31.725 --> 22:33.602
Starts now.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.272
{\an5}-You ready for this?

22:35.562 --> 22:37.272
-Definitely.

22:37.355 --> 22:39.149
{\an8}Ingenuity is very necessary
to be able to do a Cover-Up.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.610
There's a lot
of different elements,

22:41.693 --> 22:44.362
understanding
the positioning of the tattoo,

22:44.446 --> 22:46.323
and being able to disperse
light and dark evenly

22:46.406 --> 22:50.327
so it's not so obvious
where the Cover-Up is.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.454
I'll show you
where to go.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.332
My canvas
wants a Celtic cross

22:55.415 --> 22:56.958
with a dragon
wrapped around it,

22:57.042 --> 22:59.169
{\an8}and I took those key elements
and kind of combined them

22:59.252 --> 23:00.629
{\an8}into something that
would be a little bit better.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.005
This is gonna
start off black and gray,

23:02.089 --> 23:02.881
but as it fades like
you can see right here...

23:02.964 --> 23:03.924
{\an5}-Yeah, yeah.

23:02.964 --> 23:03.924
-It's gonna go into

23:04.007 --> 23:05.300
all those reds
and everything like that, dude.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.636
{\an5}-That's amazing.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.636
-The judges want you

23:07.719 --> 23:08.970
to think outside of the box,
and come up with

23:09.054 --> 23:10.847
a creative way
to get rid of a tattoo.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.016
Not only did I do that,
but I have also created

23:13.100 --> 23:15.143
a better design than
what the guy originally wanted.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.103
I have to win this one.
I have to.

23:16.186 --> 23:21.441
[tattoo machines buzzing]

{\an1}-I'm fine.

{\an5}-Samurais don't hurt.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.781
-[laughs]

23:27.864 --> 23:29.449
I am excited
I get to do a samurai.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.827
I'm not so excited about
the piece that I have to cover.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.703
{\an8}What I'm worried
is about the size.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.288
How the [bleep]
am I gonna make this

23:35.372 --> 23:37.999
fast enough, smooth enough,
to finish on time.

23:42.754 --> 23:46.174
I don't want to approach this
tattoo using a lot of black.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.260
{\an8}I want to get some
opaque grays in there.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.428
I want to use
some kind of texture.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.639
I'm gonna be down to the wire,
I think.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.809
I'm sure these other guys
are underestimating me.

23:55.892 --> 23:56.810
It's my size,
right off the bat.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.979
It's something
I've dealt with all my life,

23:59.062 --> 24:00.313
but that's what
keeps me going.

a Japanese dragon

24:07.737 --> 24:09.030
to cover up his tribal,

24:09.114 --> 24:11.741
{\an8}which is an awful big thing
to ask for on a forearm.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.744
So I'm gonna have to draw
this thing all twisted up.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.788
Tray is definitely making
some amateur mistakes.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.541
It's definitely
gonna show through.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.459
There's no way that's gonna
cover the black ink.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.299
We're gonna do
some kind of bird of paradise.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.259
The wing that's gonna
cover most of it

24:29.342 --> 24:30.760

darker colors.

I'm still feeling this could
really go either way.

or I'm pulling this off,

That bird looks horrible.

outlines in there, bud.

to show y'all that.

an easy one, though.

I'm utilizing the old tattoo
in the Cover-Up

25:26.316 --> 25:27.901

if you just cover something up

25:27.984 --> 25:29.027
with a different design,

25:29.110 --> 25:30.779
the old tattoo
will always show through.

to see this.

you know?

25:33.907 --> 25:35.283
Yeah.

The tattoo's gonna look like
an entirely different tattoo.

I'm gonna add parts,
and I'm gonna

25:37.577 --> 25:41.289
change the look of the old one
completely.

The guy
already had the waves,

25:43.041 --> 25:43.833
so what is he really
covering up?

25:43.917 --> 25:45.126
Oh, the waves
were already there?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.921
Yeah. He should've just added
more movement to that wave,

worked off of
what he had.

his nose a little bit.

it's not covering.

get me off my game,

but I have skill,
he doesn't.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.317
{\an8}He has to intimidate,
'cause his tattoos don't.

28:14.401 --> 28:15.860
This is more than
about tattooing.

go home all the time.

shipped your ass out already.

but you're about to find out.

That bird was ugly, cuz.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.436
This week you were asked
to tattoo a Cover-Up.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.354
We're testing
your Ingenuity.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.940
Kay Kutta, you're up first.

28:54.732 --> 28:56.317
What was your strategy?

28:56.401 --> 28:57.444
Well, I wanted to do a peacock,

28:57.527 --> 28:58.987
'cause I wanted
to show Chris some lines,

28:59.070 --> 29:00.989
since he said I absolutely
can't do any lines.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.700
I'm glad that you showed
you can do a nice, thin outline.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.618
I think you're actually
stepping up to the test.

29:05.702 --> 29:06.786
As far as the Cover-Up,

29:06.870 --> 29:08.329
I think
you picked a smart one.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.789
It's completely
lost in here,

29:09.873 --> 29:13.293
and it doesn't look like a big,
black spot over the Cover-Up.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.086
It's a really fancy tattoo,
man.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.422
Steve.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.176
It's a big tattoo
to cover up.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.260
That was a nightmare.

29:22.343 --> 29:24.179
For so much cool,
thought-out detail

29:24.262 --> 29:26.723
in the head and everything else,
the wings I'm not crazy about.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.933
If you would have
taken a cooler-shaped wing

29:29.017 --> 29:30.018
and bring it down,
it would have had

29:30.101 --> 29:31.019
a lot smoother flow
on her arm.

29:31.102 --> 29:34.022
You covered it,
but if it came down to it,

29:34.105 --> 29:36.191
you and Kay Kutta,
between the two birds,

29:36.274 --> 29:37.609
he probably got you
on this one.

29:37.692 --> 29:38.860
Well, I mean,
his piece is this big,

29:38.943 --> 29:40.278
and his Cover-Up's
this big.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.863
I mean, my Cover-Up's this big,
'cause my piece was this big.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.781
I can't add that much detail.
I'd love to.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.329
Mark.

29:50.914 --> 29:51.956
{\an5}-How was this for you?

29:50.914 --> 29:51.956
-The blacks were light enough

29:52.040 --> 29:54.876
that I knew I could get over it
with a light color.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.794
If you just
look at this tattoo overall...

29:58.379 --> 29:59.255
Does it look
finished to you?

29:59.339 --> 30:01.299
Thirty more minutes,

30:01.382 --> 30:03.134
and I would have made
this a stellar tattoo.

30:04.219 --> 30:07.722
So much color in the Rose,
no color in the banners,

30:07.805 --> 30:09.557
and not much color
in the stem

30:09.641 --> 30:12.227
gives you the feeling
that something is wrong with it.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.311
There's not
a lot of flow.

30:13.394 --> 30:14.479
It's a big patch
of cover,

30:14.562 --> 30:16.981
kind of unfinished,
no attachment to anything.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.191
I'm not feeling it.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.403
Lalo.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.615
One of the most difficult
things to cover up

30:25.698 --> 30:27.200
is parallel lines,

30:27.283 --> 30:28.618
and they took over
the whole calf.

30:28.701 --> 30:31.079
I think
it could have been better

30:31.162 --> 30:32.789
had you added
a little bit more flair.

30:32.872 --> 30:36.793
You got this big, dark,
black ball down there.

30:36.876 --> 30:39.045
I think if you're gon'
put something there,

30:39.128 --> 30:40.088
then put something there.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.257
This thing's
lacking detail everywhere.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.758
I thought you were
gonna murder this thing,

30:43.841 --> 30:44.926
but it murdered you.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.221
Sarah.

30:51.391 --> 30:54.269
This guy didn't necessarily
have a specific design in mind.

30:54.352 --> 30:55.812
He really liked my paintings,

30:55.895 --> 30:57.981
so that was the first thing
I kind of focused on.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.191
Her face is so realistic,

31:00.275 --> 31:02.777
and the detail on the eye
leads me to believe

31:02.860 --> 31:05.196
that you could have detailed
those fingers out.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.740
They're pretty strange.
You need to do a Cover-Up,

31:07.824 --> 31:09.909
but you also need to
do a good tattoo.

31:13.913 --> 31:14.872
Mike.

31:16.624 --> 31:17.875
I think I covered it
pretty well.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.462
My client's first option
was to do his dog,

31:21.546 --> 31:22.797
which was pure white,
and we all know

31:22.880 --> 31:24.424
that wouldn't have happened.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.675
It's definitely
one of those tattoos

31:25.758 --> 31:28.011
that's just got Cover-Up
written all over it.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.846
My first intention
with the piece

31:29.929 --> 31:31.848
was to do some more
hair texture,

31:31.931 --> 31:33.933
but I decided
to abandon that,

31:34.017 --> 31:35.852
block in some solid color,
and get that Cover-Up done.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.646
If you pulled
an American pit bull reference

31:38.730 --> 31:40.148
and you saw that this part
was lighter,

31:40.231 --> 31:43.318
you have been able to shade in,
like, some gray, even opaque,

31:43.401 --> 31:44.444
and kind of break up
this darkness,

31:44.527 --> 31:46.946
and I think that's a big
design flaw in your tattoo.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.242
Jamie.

31:53.536 --> 31:54.912
How'd you feel
about the canvas you got?

31:54.996 --> 31:56.331
Well, I think
there's no question

31:56.414 --> 31:58.124
that Kay [bleep] Me pretty good
on this one, right off the bat.

31:58.207 --> 32:01.502
You can see a little bit
of the tattoo in the background.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.754
I feel like
some of the lines in the fabric

32:02.837 --> 32:04.213
could have been redirected

32:04.297 --> 32:07.342
to fit the darker parts
of the design over the Cover-Up,

32:07.425 --> 32:08.718
which would help hide it better.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.386
I was hoping to be able to work
the texture a little bit more.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.513
I don't think it completes
the challenge as well

32:12.597 --> 32:13.931
as some of the other
contestants did.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.310
Nick.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.022
Because the wave
was traditional,

32:21.105 --> 32:22.440
and I wanted
to utilize the wave,

32:22.523 --> 32:24.359
I just kind of
stuck with that bold look.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.568
As you know, the challenge

32:25.652 --> 32:28.196
was about Ingenuity
and Cover-Up.

32:28.279 --> 32:31.032
You can actually still see
the first tattoo.

32:31.115 --> 32:32.283
I wanted to utilize
the wave,

32:32.367 --> 32:33.159
so it didn't look like
I covered anything up,

32:33.242 --> 32:34.702
it just looked like
a new tattoo.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.912
For this challenge,

32:35.995 --> 32:37.455
you took the easy way out.

32:37.538 --> 32:40.875
There is nothing about
this tattoo that is a Cover-Up.

32:44.003 --> 32:44.962
Clint.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.383
How do you feel
about this?

32:48.466 --> 32:49.884
It's a horse with wings,
and it was dumb,

32:49.967 --> 32:51.052
so I gave him something badass.

32:51.135 --> 32:55.223
You really stepped up
to the plate of this challenge,

32:55.306 --> 32:56.724
and went [bleep] yard.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.103
You totally blew our mind,
and made an idea

33:00.186 --> 33:01.771
ten times better.

33:01.854 --> 33:02.939
What I think is weak
about this tattoo

33:03.022 --> 33:06.484
is the transition
from the body to the tail.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.152
I wish I would have had
a lot more time to actually

33:08.236 --> 33:10.697
{\an5}-work on that transition more.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.697
-It's just so gray,

33:10.780 --> 33:12.657
and then
it's just a harsh stop.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.826
I feel like
you could have done better.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.078
{\an5}-Sebastian.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.078
-Oh, boy.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.832
Tell me about this piece
that you got.

33:20.915 --> 33:24.419
She wanted
a photo-realistic beach scene.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.796
I at least got her down
to just a color-realistic,

33:26.879 --> 33:29.257
so I could actually put
a little bit of blacks in it.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.758
I'm not a fan
of these things, man.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.094
I don't know what this thing's
gonna look like in ten years.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.595
It's gonna end up touched up.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.264
We're looking for longevity.

33:36.347 --> 33:39.767
I can't give you a win
if your tattoo won't be around

33:39.851 --> 33:41.561
to be judged in ten years.

33:43.771 --> 33:44.897
Ron.

33:46.357 --> 33:47.608
How'd you feel about
getting this canvas?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.235
He wanted to get rid of
the soon-to-be-ex-wife's name,

33:49.318 --> 33:52.655
so I just tried to get
this [bleep] solid as hell.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.824
I think the background
is a little weak.

33:54.907 --> 33:57.452
Felt like if I didn't put
something back there,

33:57.535 --> 33:58.661
then it would
show through.

33:58.745 --> 33:59.746
Your time could have been
better spent

33:59.829 --> 34:01.289
just making sure
that everything

34:01.372 --> 34:03.666
on this tattoo was clean
and done right.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.794
Tray.

34:08.629 --> 34:09.964
How do you think you did
with this?

34:10.047 --> 34:12.632
I didn't think it was gonna be
that hard to cover up at first,

34:12.717 --> 34:14.135
and then when
I started tattooing,

34:14.217 --> 34:15.928
I started worrying
a little bit then.

34:16.012 --> 34:16.971
Everything's off.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.556
The spine
is completely out of whack.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.768
You weren't secure
with how to position the body

34:21.851 --> 34:23.351
to cover that tattoo.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.188
You can't win... this way.

34:28.815 --> 34:29.192
Jesse, you're up.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.987
Were you happy
to get this canvas?

34:33.070 --> 34:34.781
I was happy of the fact
that he was open to whatever.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.574
It was a big mess
of a Cover-Up.

34:37.658 --> 34:40.244
I think you did
a pretty good job masking that.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.871
I'm not typically
a new school guy,

34:41.954 --> 34:43.498
but I like what you've done.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.748
Are you gonna do

34:44.831 --> 34:45.666
{\an5}-anything else this ride?

34:44.831 --> 34:45.666
-Definitely.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.708
The person
who's gonna cash the check

34:46.793 --> 34:48.795
is the person that can do

34:48.878 --> 34:50.670
anything
that walks into the shop.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.215
You're going to have to show
other stuff.

34:55.134 --> 34:55.217
Baby.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.724
Did you feel like
you almost got two Cover-Ups?

35:01.808 --> 35:04.268
Well, like, if I would have
done just one Cover-Up,

35:04.352 --> 35:05.103
that was just
cheating on myself.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.187
You struggled
with the outline,

35:06.270 --> 35:08.856
in a couple spots,
it looked like you went over it

35:08.940 --> 35:09.857
a little bit
too many times.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.692
If anybody's ever done
a friggin' hip tattoo,

35:11.776 --> 35:14.445
the bone
is very thin skin.

35:14.529 --> 35:18.032
Whether it was stress,
time, client, skin,

35:18.115 --> 35:20.326
you can't do too many more of
these tattoos and still be here.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.082
Head back
to the loft.

35:26.165 --> 35:27.125
We'll call you back
when we've made our decision.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.758
Nick, I don't know
what the [bleep] you covered.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.052
The lighthouse
wasn't covering anything.

35:38.135 --> 35:41.138
{\an8}Nick didn't cover the
wave, he just added to it.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.807
I did the same thing I did
at the Flash Challenge, dude.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.892
I utilized what was there.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.061
But there's a glow behind it,
and then it goes into water.

35:47.144 --> 35:48.062
It's [bleep] perfect.

35:48.145 --> 35:49.772
I appreciate you
sticking up for your art.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.065
I understand
what you're saying.

35:51.148 --> 35:53.401
Nick didn't cover it,
he reworked it.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.402
{\an8}[Bleep] Cop-out.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.903
How hard is it
to cover waves with waves?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.196
I know I had an easy one, but
I brought it and it looks great.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.657
The name of this challenge
is <i> Ingenuity.</i>

35:59.740 --> 36:01.284
{\an8}I had a more creative idea.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.660
But you can still tell
that he colored over

36:02.743 --> 36:04.078
some [bleep] that was old.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.663
{\an5}-That white-- that white ink--

36:04.161 --> 36:05.663
-No, you can't.

36:05.746 --> 36:06.873
{\an5}-No, you can't.

36:05.746 --> 36:06.873
-You can tell that there was

36:06.956 --> 36:07.915
{\an5}-some [bleep] underneath it.

36:06.956 --> 36:07.915
-No, you can't.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.292
Because I utilized
the old tattoo, you'll never

36:09.375 --> 36:10.835
{\an5}-know it was a Cover-Up.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.835
-But you could tell that there

36:10.918 --> 36:12.044
was thicker ink in the middle
than there was on the sides.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.713
Because there was
supposed to be.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.715
All right, we'll see
when we get to elimination.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.100
When it comes to
this Cover-Up,

36:26.183 --> 36:28.811
who showed
the most Ingenuity this week?

36:28.895 --> 36:30.062
Definitely Jesse and Sarah.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.272
Sarah
kind of rocked it.

36:31.355 --> 36:34.525
It's got a lot of tricks to it,
it's really fancy,

36:34.609 --> 36:34.984
and it's beautiful.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.527
I think Jesse.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.571
His light sources, his shading,

36:38.654 --> 36:40.489
his textures are incredible.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.784
You can't deny his talent.
I think it was really solid.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.578
I really love
Clint's piece here.

36:45.661 --> 36:46.996
There are some design flaws
in there.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.247
{\an5}-Heavy design flaws.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.247
-Yeah.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.499
One wing, to the left,
is coming out of his neck,

36:50.583 --> 36:52.793
and the other one's coming out
behind that spot.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.463
Had his eyes on the prize,
and not on the detail.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.297
If we're going on
the other side of things,

36:56.380 --> 36:59.258
Mike did such a huge
black image

36:59.342 --> 37:01.802
that there wasn't a whole lot
of Ingenuity at play there.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.554
The shading
is just deliberately

37:03.638 --> 37:04.764
right around the Cover-Up.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.641
I think he gave the client
exactly what he wanted.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.018
If that's the case, then
it shouldn't have been so dark.

37:09.101 --> 37:11.228
This is definitely
one of the bottoms for today.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.439
Lalo really surprised me
this week.

37:13.522 --> 37:14.482
{\an5}-Shocking.

37:13.522 --> 37:14.482
-If you look at

37:14.565 --> 37:15.316
some of these lines
in the armor,

37:15.399 --> 37:17.944
how squirmy and squiggly
those are.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.028
Yeah, terrible.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.113
He definitely did
one of the worst tattoos today.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.282
{\an5}-Tray as well.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.282
-A lot of the original tattoo

37:23.366 --> 37:25.660
poking through,
certainly in the orange.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.828
The only place
on this entire tattoo

37:27.912 --> 37:31.374
that the Cover-Up ended up is
in the place where it's orange,

37:31.457 --> 37:32.500
instead of green or black.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.336
This was just a flaw
in conceptualizing

37:35.419 --> 37:36.754
where you're gonna
place your Cover-Up.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.089
It's definitely
down on the bottom.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.882
I think we have a decision,
yeah?

37:39.966 --> 37:40.925
{\an5}-Yeah.

37:39.966 --> 37:40.925
-Let's do it.

37:41.008 --> 37:42.176
All right.

37:49.100 --> 37:55.106
All right, guys, we need to see
Tray, Jesse, Lalo, and Mike.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.232
See you on the shop.

37:57.483 --> 37:57.525
Ugh.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.289
While there are
no easy tattoos,

38:12.373 --> 38:14.291
Cover-Ups
are generally reserved

38:14.375 --> 38:16.293
for the more experienced
tattooers.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.629
One of you did excel
with your Cover-Up.

38:18.713 --> 38:22.800
The judges have decided that
the best tattoo of the day...

38:27.680 --> 38:28.681
Goes to Jesse.

38:28.764 --> 38:31.183
Undeniably, you did
the smoothest, cleanest,

38:31.267 --> 38:32.977
biggest, baddest tattoo
of the day,

38:33.060 --> 38:34.562
and you deserve the victory.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.147
Thank you.

38:37.356 --> 38:41.485
Lalo, Mike, Tray,

38:41.569 --> 38:44.321
none of you
impressed US today.

38:44.405 --> 38:47.908
Mike, you did a big, huge,
black tattoo.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.077
Not exactly
what we're looking for.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.872
We're not looking for the big,
obvious, black Cover-Up.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.415
I think
I made the right choice

38:54.498 --> 38:55.750
by pounding in the black,

38:55.833 --> 38:59.420
because my first approach
was to load it up with texture,

38:59.503 --> 39:01.338
but I don't think my client's
skin could've handled it.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.967
I'd rather be up here
for pounding in solid black

39:05.051 --> 39:07.636
than have a screen
full of chopped meat up there.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.596
It's one of the weakest.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.765
Out of all of
the bottom three here,

39:10.848 --> 39:14.226
the only person that still
had a tattoo showing through

39:14.310 --> 39:15.436
a little bit was Tray.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.772
I mean, we are here
to cover up tattoos.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.778
Tray, if you were
in the middle before,

39:23.861 --> 39:25.112
you're even lower now.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.698
We're not here to see who can do
the most mediocre tattoo.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.159
There was things I planned
on doing with the flames,

39:30.242 --> 39:32.328
I had intentions
on hiding it better.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.580
Your weakest link in
this tattoo was from the start.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.123
Laid out different, you
would've had less tattoo to do.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.709
Your strategy starts
from the second

39:38.793 --> 39:39.460
you start
talking to that client.

39:39.543 --> 39:40.211
At least
the outline was clean,

39:40.294 --> 39:42.588
the color was solid, you know.

39:42.671 --> 39:45.841
Lalo's had rough shading
in places, rough outline.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.262
Lalo, you realize that
the majority of everything

39:50.346 --> 39:51.514
that you're gonna be
asked to do

39:51.597 --> 39:52.890
is gonna be
pretty heavy outline.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.142
I think the weakest lines
are the ones in the background,

39:55.226 --> 39:56.977
which I had to do
in the end,

39:57.061 --> 39:59.563
but that's not excuse
to not do every tattoo right.

39:59.647 --> 40:00.856
I can do
clean outlines.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.233
It's night and day,
the performance, man.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.026
I hope you can turn it around,
because I'd like

40:04.110 --> 40:05.903
to see the good stuff
that I know you have.

40:09.698 --> 40:12.493
Any one of you could
justifiably be sent home.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.123
The judges have decided.

40:26.132 --> 40:29.927
Mike, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

40:30.511 --> 40:32.179
You're simply going home

40:32.263 --> 40:33.305
because your color palette
is way off,

40:33.389 --> 40:35.850
because you're in
such a dark area.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.561
A lot of black.
You took the easy way out

40:38.644 --> 40:39.603
on this Cover-Up.

40:39.687 --> 40:40.563
That sent you home today.

40:40.646 --> 40:43.440
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

40:43.524 --> 40:44.817
You get stuck
with that persistent client

40:44.900 --> 40:47.194
that wants what he wants and
won't take "no" for an answer,

40:47.278 --> 40:50.406
you're [bleep].
All that really matters

40:50.489 --> 40:51.866
is that
your client is happy,

40:51.949 --> 40:54.368
but that doesn't keep me here
for another week.

40:56.579 --> 41:00.166
[announcer] On the next
episode of <i> Ink Master...</i>

41:00.249 --> 41:01.709
You're weak,
you're weak.

41:01.792 --> 41:02.293
{\an5}-Okay.

41:01.792 --> 41:02.293
-You're definitely weak.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.586
You mean nothing to me.

41:03.669 --> 41:08.215
I can tattoo circles around
Kay Kutta any day of the week.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.675
Think you're gonna
finish this thing all right?

41:09.758 --> 41:11.969
If they want to send
my ass home because I did

41:12.052 --> 41:13.929
really badass lines
and then I sculpted 'em,

41:14.013 --> 41:16.098
[bleep] It.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.767
{\an8}How do you walk into
this competition not prepared?

41:18.851 --> 41:20.644
{\an8}It's brutal.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.730
{\an8}If you don't pass
the first grade,

41:22.813 --> 41:25.983
{\an8}you don't go
to the second grade.
