WEBVTT

00:16.714 --> 00:18.146
We're not here to eat.

00:18.170 --> 00:19.514
We're here to protect the Director.

00:19.538 --> 00:21.760
Ziva, this is probably
the most secure building

00:21.784 --> 00:23.095
in the whole country right now.

00:23.119 --> 00:25.604
CIA, DSS, ATF, FBI,

00:25.628 --> 00:26.632
the whole alphabet's here.

00:26.656 --> 00:28.461
Not to mention state troopers,

00:28.485 --> 00:32.729
metro cops and NCIS's finest... me.

00:34.447 --> 00:35.579
And you.

00:35.929 --> 00:37.428
But me is hungry.

00:37.452 --> 00:39.407
These are public servants like us.

00:39.431 --> 00:40.435
And this is free food.

00:40.459 --> 00:41.933
Some are defense contractors.

00:41.957 --> 00:45.294
Beltway bandits who make a career
of stealing from the public trough.

00:45.318 --> 00:46.166
Politicians.

00:46.190 --> 00:48.318
You ever seen a skinny politician?

00:48.809 --> 00:49.997
Too late.

00:50.021 --> 00:51.663
Our guest of honor has just arrived.

00:51.687 --> 00:52.754
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:52.778 --> 00:54.547
the retiring Secretary of Defense

00:54.571 --> 00:56.756
of the United States of America.

00:58.872 --> 01:00.550
I'm going to get something to eat.

01:06.018 --> 01:07.441
Director!

02:17.181 --> 02:18.752
Morning, Gibbs, McGee.

02:18.776 --> 02:19.709
Director Shepard.

02:19.733 --> 02:21.715
Our gatecrasher was a marine.

02:21.739 --> 02:23.906
Sergeant Brian Wright.

02:23.930 --> 02:26.451
The hotel was in lockdown and
he wasn't a registered guest.

02:26.475 --> 02:29.762
He took a dive from up there somewhere.

02:30.267 --> 02:31.742
SecDef staff are worried

02:31.766 --> 02:33.818
that it was an attempt
on the life of their boss.

02:33.842 --> 02:35.178
Are we worried?

02:35.527 --> 02:38.147
If it was an assassination
attempt, he's a lousy assassin.

02:38.171 --> 02:40.948
He used his body as a
weapon and missed by 75 feet.

02:40.972 --> 02:42.258
Ducky's doing preliminaries.

02:42.282 --> 02:46.440
I've got Tony liaising between
Metro and hotel management.

02:46.464 --> 02:47.691
And we have a witness.

02:47.715 --> 02:49.180
Andy Nelson.

02:49.204 --> 02:50.293
Ziva's with him.

02:50.317 --> 02:52.104
He's an aide to a congressman.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.355
Nelson claims he was
attacked by the deceased

02:54.379 --> 02:56.914
on the sixth floor just
before the incident.

02:56.938 --> 02:57.630
You believe him?

02:57.654 --> 03:00.448
He works for a politician,
what do you think?

03:00.472 --> 03:02.305
I'm officially handing over.

03:02.329 --> 03:04.144
I've got my own fires to put out.

03:04.168 --> 03:07.019
This happened in our backyard.
It's making a lot of people nervous.

03:07.043 --> 03:10.146
I'd appreciate a quick
result on this one.

03:12.154 --> 03:15.300
The question is: Did he
jump or was he pushed?

03:16.425 --> 03:18.380
I guess that's what
we're here to find out.

03:19.594 --> 03:20.594
Go.

03:24.368 --> 03:26.600
Enough. It's okay.

03:27.576 --> 03:30.452
Mr. Nelson has been
explaining how he got injured.

03:32.719 --> 03:34.056
He just came at me.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.410
He hit me...

03:35.434 --> 03:36.828
I fell down and he ran away.

03:36.852 --> 03:38.147
You see him fall?

03:38.266 --> 03:39.752
I just got out of there.

03:39.776 --> 03:42.708
I was down in the lobby
to report it when he fell.

03:42.732 --> 03:43.984
Why were you on the sixth floor?

03:44.008 --> 03:45.459
I was delivering a briefing paper

03:45.483 --> 03:48.288
to a defense contractor
in one of the suites.

03:48.612 --> 03:50.347
Norforce Systems.

03:50.384 --> 03:52.416
I was walking towards the elevator.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.870
You seen him before?

03:53.975 --> 03:55.611
Every day.

03:56.172 --> 03:57.879
Congressman Getz.

03:59.249 --> 04:01.114
Well, not the deceased.

04:01.138 --> 04:02.000
Just...

04:02.024 --> 04:04.003
sad souls like him.

04:04.027 --> 04:05.251
The homeless.

04:05.275 --> 04:06.655
Unconfirmed.

04:06.777 --> 04:08.284
And a war veteran...

04:08.308 --> 04:12.112
or we'd be talking to
metro police and not NCIS.

04:12.136 --> 04:12.800
Agent?

04:12.824 --> 04:14.657
Special Agent Gibbs.

04:14.681 --> 04:16.245
And he was a marine.

04:17.247 --> 04:19.108
We need to do more to...

04:19.132 --> 04:21.334
help the ones who come back broken.

04:21.358 --> 04:22.746
Yes, you do.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.608
Let's get that X-rayed, Andy.

04:27.632 --> 04:28.663
Unless Agent Gibbs

04:28.687 --> 04:32.163
has more questions about
this unfortunate incident.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.546
Did I just miss something?

04:39.390 --> 04:44.386
The Congressman thinks our
marine was crazy and jumped.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.806
DiNozzo...

04:46.162 --> 04:47.699
- Boss?
- Stop eating the evidence.

04:47.723 --> 04:49.181
Right, boss.

04:49.778 --> 04:51.143
Got preliminaries?

04:51.167 --> 04:53.811
I find the ones who
fall are the saddest.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.764
It's a long last moment
to contemplate one's end.

04:56.788 --> 04:59.769
And no chance to change one's mind.

04:59.793 --> 05:02.371
Well, the injuries are
consistent with a fall.

05:02.395 --> 05:03.853
But...

05:03.933 --> 05:06.011
scraped knuckles possibly in a fight

05:06.035 --> 05:07.634
before he went over the edge.

05:07.658 --> 05:09.308
Missing a shoe. No wallet.

05:09.332 --> 05:12.126
Although he had some
dollars in his pocket.

05:12.234 --> 05:15.649
And a begging note asking for help.

05:15.966 --> 05:19.957
The only real surprise is this.

05:21.715 --> 05:24.187
A Bronze Star for valor.

05:24.211 --> 05:25.293
And a Purple Heart.

05:25.317 --> 05:27.157
With two Marine Stars.

05:27.181 --> 05:29.907
It means he was wounded
three times in battle.

05:29.931 --> 05:31.658
I can't tell you why he died,

05:31.682 --> 05:34.447
but I can perhaps tell you how he lived.

05:34.539 --> 05:36.338
The man was a hero.

05:39.076 --> 05:39.995
Yeah. Gibbs.

05:40.019 --> 05:41.414
Hey, boss.

05:41.788 --> 05:43.941
Looks like this is where he launched.

05:43.965 --> 05:46.659
The shoe must have come off
when he went over the side.

05:46.683 --> 05:47.908
Okay.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.506
Nelson said he was back
downstairs when Wright fell.

05:50.530 --> 05:52.971
The question is: What
was Sergeant Wright doing?

05:52.995 --> 05:54.567
Deciding whether to jump.

05:54.591 --> 05:55.453
Photographs.

05:55.477 --> 05:56.477
Got it.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.998
DiNozzo.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.281
The stairs.

06:02.388 --> 06:04.101
Maybe the Congressman was right.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.532
Maybe Sergeant Wright
was crazy and jumped.

06:06.556 --> 06:08.078
Or the Director was right.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.688
Politicians lie.

06:11.908 --> 06:14.909
And we will need a copy
of his medical records.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.152
You're disgusting.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.169
How can you eat that?

06:19.193 --> 06:23.103
You see, Ziva, the human
body is a finely tuned engine.

06:23.127 --> 06:25.698
None more finely tuned than mine.

06:26.157 --> 06:28.335
Even the best engine needs oil.

06:28.848 --> 06:29.973
DiNozzo.

06:31.556 --> 06:32.703
Boss.

06:33.208 --> 06:35.408
Anything from the hotel registry?

06:41.388 --> 06:44.236
702 names, none of them Sergeant Wright.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.503
Ziva, Congressman's aide.

06:46.527 --> 06:47.992
Single. No criminal record.

06:48.016 --> 06:50.251
He worked for the Congressman
for the past seven years.

06:50.275 --> 06:53.081
And according to Norforce
Systems, a briefing paper

06:53.105 --> 06:56.115
from the Congressman's office
was delivered to their suite,

06:56.139 --> 06:58.022
but they can't put a time on it.

06:58.046 --> 07:01.075
Boss, just got off the phone
with Wright's doctor in Bethesda.

07:01.099 --> 07:02.829
He did two tours in Iraq.

07:02.853 --> 07:04.201
He was wounded three times.

07:04.225 --> 07:05.337
The last time was the worst.

07:05.361 --> 07:07.058
His Humvee was hit by an IED.

07:07.082 --> 07:09.421
Suffered shrapnel wounds to the head.

07:09.445 --> 07:11.154
He's been in medical
leave for four months.

07:11.178 --> 07:12.887
But according to the hospital records,

07:12.911 --> 07:15.191
he's missed his last
three weekly appointments.

07:15.215 --> 07:16.446
No one noticed?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.037
Said he fell through the cracks.

07:18.061 --> 07:18.938
Family?

07:18.962 --> 07:20.653
Divorced, no kids.

07:20.677 --> 07:23.631
His doctor said he stayed
with friends, at hostels...

07:23.655 --> 07:24.772
sometimes on the street.

07:24.796 --> 07:25.920
What kind of doctor?

07:25.944 --> 07:26.878
Psychiatrist.

07:26.902 --> 07:29.090
- Treated for?
- Depression.

07:29.531 --> 07:31.386
Some way to treat a war hero.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.598
Thought marines looked after their own.

07:33.622 --> 07:34.888
How does a homeless man

07:34.912 --> 07:37.454
get past the security
agents, local cops,

07:37.478 --> 07:40.450
hotel staff, into a
locked-down building?

07:43.557 --> 07:46.019
Maybe he was already there.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.512
Luis Romero?

07:54.670 --> 07:55.670
Yep.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.466
Special Agent Gibbs. NCIS.

07:58.490 --> 07:59.636
Is this about the jumper?

07:59.660 --> 08:01.153
So you saw him jump?

08:01.177 --> 08:02.177
No.

08:02.567 --> 08:04.627
- But you saw him.
- No.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.250
Corporal Luis Romero,

08:06.274 --> 08:08.150
United States Marine Corps.

08:08.174 --> 08:11.921
One tour Afghanistan, honorable
discharge 18 months ago.

08:11.945 --> 08:14.165
Since then, hotel
maintenance supervisor.

08:14.189 --> 08:16.094
So I'm a former marine.

08:16.344 --> 08:17.433
A lot of guys are.

08:17.457 --> 08:18.627
Not at this hotel.

08:18.651 --> 08:20.851
We look after our own, don't we...

08:21.002 --> 08:22.135
Luis?

08:25.716 --> 08:26.798
All right.

08:26.822 --> 08:30.169
We served in the same unit three years
ago. He didn't have a place to sleep.

08:30.193 --> 08:31.286
So where did you put him?

08:31.310 --> 08:33.572
We've always got a couple
rooms down for maintenance.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.791
I didn't see any harm in it.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.897
How long had he been here?

08:35.921 --> 08:38.567
A couple times a week
for the last month.

08:40.414 --> 08:41.621
Didn't cause any trouble.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.138
Semper Fi...

08:43.162 --> 08:44.251
you know.

08:45.217 --> 08:46.782
Show us the room.

08:52.590 --> 08:54.311
Wait at the door, please.

08:56.492 --> 08:57.567
Anyone else been in here?

08:57.591 --> 08:59.114
No, just him.

09:06.298 --> 09:08.232
Luis! Luis!

09:09.818 --> 09:10.139
Yeah.

09:10.205 --> 09:12.576
Luis, algo ha passado!
Tienes que venir pronto!

09:13.497 --> 09:15.349
Um... something's happened.

09:20.399 --> 09:21.857
No lo creo, No lo creo!

09:21.973 --> 09:24.891
Luis, ahi, ahi, en
el cuarto, en la cama!

09:26.515 --> 09:28.388
Dios mio que...!

09:40.165 --> 09:41.566
I understand, Chief,

09:41.590 --> 09:44.030
but we believe the two cases are linked.

09:44.054 --> 09:45.543
NCIS have any proof?

09:45.567 --> 09:48.443
No, not yet, we're still
collecting evidence.

09:48.467 --> 09:49.364
You'll send us a report?

09:49.388 --> 09:50.906
Yes, absolutely.

09:50.930 --> 09:51.828
Okay.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.109
And if anything changes,

09:53.133 --> 09:55.875
we will hand over everything we have.

09:55.956 --> 09:57.450
So if you can't tie it together,

09:57.474 --> 09:58.852
you'll turn it over to my people.

09:58.876 --> 09:59.905
That's right,

09:59.929 --> 10:03.120
and cause of death hasn't
been determined yet either.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.368
Fair enough. Let me know.

10:04.392 --> 10:06.693
Thank you, Chief. I will.

10:06.717 --> 10:07.910
Thank you.

10:08.627 --> 10:10.078
You get all that, Jethro?

10:10.102 --> 10:11.081
Got it.

10:11.105 --> 10:13.193
Metro police will want to see results.

10:13.217 --> 10:14.374
Add him to the list.

10:14.398 --> 10:15.802
It's a long list.

10:15.826 --> 10:17.348
And it's getting longer.

10:17.372 --> 10:18.887
Working on it.

10:19.335 --> 10:21.244
There's something on her cheek.

10:22.635 --> 10:24.334
Looks like saliva.

10:24.358 --> 10:25.616
Kiss and kill.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.956
Well, no bag. Maybe the killer took it.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.752
Maybe she just didn't have a bag.

10:29.776 --> 10:31.658
Every woman has a bag.

10:31.682 --> 10:33.102
Do I have a bag, McGee?

10:33.126 --> 10:34.850
No, but you're not a...

10:37.632 --> 10:40.076
I mean, you're a woman.
You're just, you're not a...

10:41.575 --> 10:43.108
not a normal...

10:45.173 --> 10:48.084
You're right. Every
woman does not have a bag.

10:50.020 --> 10:50.993
How old?

10:51.017 --> 10:53.948
No I.D., no pocketbook and no bag

10:53.972 --> 10:54.950
either.

10:54.974 --> 10:57.218
The room was booked to Michael Lo.

10:57.242 --> 11:00.210
Sounds Asian. Single occupancy.

11:00.251 --> 11:02.477
Room was paid for in cash in advance.

11:02.501 --> 11:03.691
Sounds fake.

11:03.715 --> 11:06.715
They're gonna review the security
tapes to send us what they got.

11:08.633 --> 11:09.847
Boss?

11:16.524 --> 11:17.876
Mr. Romero,

11:19.049 --> 11:20.017
recognize this?

11:20.041 --> 11:22.702
It's, um, key card I
gave Sergeant Wright.

11:22.726 --> 11:25.651
It's a master key. It opens
up every room in the hotel.

11:37.391 --> 11:38.702
You okay?

11:40.341 --> 11:41.248
Never better.

11:41.272 --> 11:42.497
You look run-over.

11:42.521 --> 11:44.630
The term is "run-down."

11:44.887 --> 11:45.977
I do?

11:48.428 --> 11:50.404
Maybe you need servicing.

11:50.582 --> 11:52.185
Clearly, we're still
having some problems

11:52.209 --> 11:54.577
with the idiosyncrasies
of the English language.

11:54.601 --> 11:57.906
The "finely tuned engine,"
I think you called it.

11:58.978 --> 12:00.731
You should see a doctor.

12:12.841 --> 12:14.143
Hello.

12:14.409 --> 12:15.641
Hi.

12:16.567 --> 12:17.765
Yeah.

12:18.331 --> 12:20.355
No, it's not a bad time.

12:20.816 --> 12:22.645
This afternoon would be great.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.799
Well, I will see you then.

12:26.216 --> 12:28.184
Okay, bye.

12:30.776 --> 12:32.415
Two cell phones, huh?

12:32.486 --> 12:35.105
Uh, one for each ear.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.288
No, it's a spare.

12:38.312 --> 12:41.148
This one sort of been on the fritz.

12:41.245 --> 12:43.862
That's another word you probably
don't know the meaning of.

12:43.886 --> 12:44.535
Acts up?

12:44.559 --> 12:46.012
I'm impressed.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.232
All right.

12:49.570 --> 12:51.023
I'm heading out...

12:52.755 --> 12:55.868
to go see the doctor
about being run over...

12:55.892 --> 12:57.131
down.

12:57.155 --> 12:58.997
Don't forget Fritz.

13:04.771 --> 13:07.181
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

13:09.591 --> 13:12.713
Fingerprints solve ten
times more cases than DNA.

13:12.737 --> 13:14.487
Did you know that, McGee?

13:14.806 --> 13:16.366
Yeah, I told you.

13:16.685 --> 13:17.352
You did?

13:17.376 --> 13:18.457
Yeah.

13:18.670 --> 13:20.012
You did!

13:20.358 --> 13:21.658
Got to love fingerprints.

13:21.682 --> 13:23.940
Especially this one from the key card.

13:23.964 --> 13:25.770
Pristine index...

13:25.794 --> 13:28.322
with an almost perfect whorl and three,

13:28.346 --> 13:30.572
count 'em, three, McGee,

13:30.596 --> 13:32.661
equally spaced deltas.

13:33.268 --> 13:34.378
It's a work of art.

13:34.402 --> 13:36.275
Then we have the short and curlies.

13:36.299 --> 13:38.982
The hair, there's no
follicle and no DNA,

13:39.006 --> 13:42.172
so I am checking it for drug history.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.935
If it is Sergeant Wright's,

13:43.959 --> 13:46.208
considering his
extensive medical records,

13:46.232 --> 13:48.837
this should read like
a drugstore inventory.

13:49.949 --> 13:52.714
And if it doesn't, he ain't our man.

13:55.479 --> 13:56.908
What price valor?

13:56.932 --> 13:58.318
18 bucks.

13:58.342 --> 13:59.230
For real.

13:59.254 --> 14:02.850
I looked it up on eBay,
Bronze Star, 18 bucks.

14:02.874 --> 14:05.931
No wonder he got depressed and
started living on the streets.

14:06.392 --> 14:07.417
And begging.

14:07.441 --> 14:09.358
One minute you're a
hero, the next you're a...

14:09.382 --> 14:10.541
suspect.

14:10.565 --> 14:13.153
But don't give up on him yet, McGee.

14:16.529 --> 14:17.637
Nope.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.813
Where's Gibbs?

14:22.244 --> 14:23.777
What am I looking at?

14:24.114 --> 14:26.019
Nothing.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.141
Nothing's good, right?

14:28.165 --> 14:29.382
Oh, yeah, nothing is very good.

14:29.406 --> 14:31.504
If this was Wright's hair,

14:31.528 --> 14:34.162
then it'd be like looking in
a window of his drug history,

14:34.186 --> 14:35.731
but all this shows is...

14:35.755 --> 14:37.388
Unknown trace elements.

14:37.412 --> 14:40.051
Too minute to be picked up
by the mass spec equipment.

14:40.075 --> 14:41.411
So it's probably not Wright's.

14:41.435 --> 14:42.882
But we can't be sure they're not there

14:42.906 --> 14:44.300
unless we get a better microscope.

14:44.324 --> 14:46.384
We're talking nanoparticles here, Gibbs.

14:46.408 --> 14:47.084
We need a...

14:47.108 --> 14:49.419
An infrared microspectroscopy unit.

14:49.443 --> 14:51.709
It's the only thing that
gets down to the nano level.

14:51.733 --> 14:52.923
Okay, get one.

14:52.947 --> 14:54.797
They cost about a hundred grand.

14:54.821 --> 14:55.621
Yeah, so?

14:55.645 --> 14:57.190
So it's not in the budget.

14:57.214 --> 14:58.431
Maybe next year.

14:58.455 --> 15:00.131
She needs one now.

15:00.373 --> 15:01.720
Sorry.

15:02.562 --> 15:04.024
I could haggle.

15:04.157 --> 15:06.198
My Uncle Horace, he was a great haggler.

15:06.222 --> 15:08.366
They used to call him
Horace the Haggler.

15:10.891 --> 15:12.631
I could borrow one.

15:15.055 --> 15:16.730
I'll try and borrow one.

15:18.454 --> 15:20.678
It's the fingerprint from the key card.

15:21.772 --> 15:24.158
It's not good. It puts him
in the dead girl's room.

15:24.182 --> 15:25.142
Sorry, Jethro.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.947
Find out who owns that.

15:27.665 --> 15:28.420
Come on.

15:28.444 --> 15:29.227
Don't start.

15:29.251 --> 15:30.694
Do you know how many
people want money from me?

15:30.718 --> 15:32.572
Did I say anything?

15:32.596 --> 15:33.968
How are you going to get loaned

15:33.992 --> 15:36.942
an infrared microspectroscopy unit?

15:37.430 --> 15:39.530
Good question, McGee.

15:40.558 --> 15:42.241
Good question.

15:42.481 --> 15:43.737
I love playing windows-shopping.

15:43.761 --> 15:44.957
How about you?

15:45.316 --> 15:48.046
Oh, yeah, me, too.

15:49.445 --> 15:51.289
Only when I'm with you.

15:51.386 --> 15:52.640
Cold?

15:53.614 --> 15:54.928
It's invigorating.

15:54.952 --> 15:55.850
Chilly.

15:55.874 --> 15:56.904
Freezing.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.820
Oh Poor Tony. I drag you out
here to go window-shopping.

15:59.844 --> 16:01.952
Next time maybe you should choose.

16:03.246 --> 16:04.259
Hot tub.

16:04.283 --> 16:06.884
I know something else
we could do to stay warm.

16:07.256 --> 16:09.037
- Really?
- Mm.

16:09.103 --> 16:10.488
- I wonder what that could be.
- One cappuccino,

16:10.512 --> 16:11.921
one latte.

16:12.101 --> 16:12.706
Coffee?

16:12.730 --> 16:14.741
Mm, dancing.

16:15.946 --> 16:17.293
Dancing.

16:17.418 --> 16:19.028
Dancing would make you warm.

16:19.052 --> 16:20.736
Then tonight we dance.

16:21.649 --> 16:23.341
Tonight?

16:23.979 --> 16:26.017
Don't tell me you have to work.

16:26.921 --> 16:29.898
Tonight, dancing, tomorrow, work.

16:30.536 --> 16:32.791
You don't seem too happy about that.

16:32.911 --> 16:34.320
I'm worried.

16:34.905 --> 16:36.424
Worried about what?

16:37.276 --> 16:38.449
Well...

16:38.670 --> 16:42.251
we're going dancing tonight and
I haven't got a thing to wear.

16:43.017 --> 16:45.288
Has anyone ever told
you you're an idiot?

16:45.312 --> 16:47.616
Yeah, my boss, all the time.

17:13.396 --> 17:14.565
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

17:14.589 --> 17:15.891
Excuse me.

17:19.146 --> 17:20.461
Yes!

17:20.484 --> 17:22.291
Just leave it on the table.

17:25.934 --> 17:27.098
That's not juice.

17:27.122 --> 17:32.743
Well, the coffee bean comes
from the coffee cherry, so

17:32.767 --> 17:35.166
that's technically a fruit,

17:35.190 --> 17:37.186
so the case could be made that...

17:37.210 --> 17:39.859
coffee is more fruit than bean.

17:40.462 --> 17:42.254
It's coffee juice.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.141
Caf-Pow.

17:43.165 --> 17:43.889
Caf-Pow!?

17:43.913 --> 17:46.687
Yeah, two words
hyphenated in the middle.

17:47.095 --> 17:48.484
Can I help you with something?

17:48.508 --> 17:49.694
I was hoping to get a...

17:49.718 --> 17:54.423
demonstration of your infrared
microspectroscopy unit.

17:54.702 --> 17:56.498
You don't work here?

17:56.656 --> 17:58.404
Like this place would hire me?

17:58.428 --> 18:00.633
Sorry. I'll set up a sample.

18:00.657 --> 18:02.814
No, no, I have one.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.998
I brought my own.

18:07.085 --> 18:09.711
I work for NCIS in D.C.,

18:09.735 --> 18:11.588
but we don't have
anything that can get down

18:11.612 --> 18:12.728
to the nanogram level,

18:12.752 --> 18:15.678
which is what I need to figure out what
the hell is going on with my sample.

18:15.702 --> 18:18.035
You don't mind that
I said "hell," do you?

18:18.059 --> 18:18.744
Hell, no.

18:18.768 --> 18:21.079
Oh, good. I mean,
some people do, then...

18:21.103 --> 18:25.137
you get into the whole hell and death and
dying mortality thing and it freaks them out.

18:25.161 --> 18:26.748
Can you help me?

18:27.062 --> 18:28.110
If you want to leave it with me...

18:28.134 --> 18:29.476
No, I can't.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.531
Chain of evidence.

18:30.555 --> 18:32.894
I have to do it with you.

18:33.315 --> 18:35.603
Uh, not with you, but alongside you.

18:35.627 --> 18:38.086
I have to be with you. I have to...

18:38.485 --> 18:41.505
be with you while you
do it. While you test it.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.899
I normally like to know
who it is I'm working with.

18:44.178 --> 18:45.014
Marty Pearson.

18:45.038 --> 18:47.457
Abby Sciuto.

18:48.357 --> 18:49.329
Nanograms, eh?

18:49.353 --> 18:50.769
Yes.

18:50.793 --> 18:52.475
Pesky little nanograms.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.351
- Is that a...?
- Yes, it is.

18:54.626 --> 18:55.897
Cool.

19:03.965 --> 19:05.997
Wright, Sergeant
Brian. Records, medical.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.552
Oh, splendid.

19:07.576 --> 19:10.822
Uh, I'm a little post-autopsy.

19:10.846 --> 19:12.632
Mr. Palmer will sign it.

19:12.656 --> 19:13.483
Sure.

19:13.507 --> 19:16.690
We must get you down here
more often, Agent Lee.

19:16.714 --> 19:19.465
Always room for another
bright young mind.

19:19.489 --> 19:21.719
Not that there's anything
wrong with the legal department.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.958
It's an essential cog in
the engine, so to speak.

19:24.982 --> 19:29.677
It can't be much fun for
a hands-on type like you.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.192
You think?

19:35.339 --> 19:36.263
Done?

19:36.287 --> 19:37.732
Done indeed.

19:38.002 --> 19:41.192
Intrigue, mystery and a surprise or two.

19:41.312 --> 19:46.291
Yes, I've estimated our
victim's age at about 14.

19:46.438 --> 19:49.874
Death was due to strangulation.
She had bleeding in her throat

19:49.898 --> 19:53.531
and the hyoid bone was fractured.

19:56.326 --> 19:59.307
Some bruising on the sternum
that has me a bit puzzled.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.897
Possibly postmortem.

20:00.921 --> 20:01.588
Conscious?

20:01.612 --> 20:04.991
Superficial scratching
and ante mortem bruising

20:05.015 --> 20:08.349
suggests that she put
up a struggle of sorts.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.743
But toxicology indicates
that she was drugged

20:11.767 --> 20:13.294
and for some time.

20:13.318 --> 20:14.536
Hours?

20:14.868 --> 20:16.103
Possibly days.

20:16.127 --> 20:19.014
There are traces of
sedatives and Rohypnol,

20:19.038 --> 20:21.764
the drug of choice for date-rapists.

20:21.788 --> 20:25.782
And before you ask the
question, yes, she was,

20:25.806 --> 20:28.554
but he must have worn a condom.

20:29.085 --> 20:32.911
The really good news is
that I've identified her.

20:32.935 --> 20:33.638
By name?

20:33.662 --> 20:35.011
No, by country.

20:35.035 --> 20:36.798
She's Chinese.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.127
Yes, you're less than impressed.

20:39.151 --> 20:41.268
But what if I told you
that four weeks ago,

20:41.292 --> 20:43.323
she was working on the family farm

20:43.347 --> 20:45.924
in a coastal region of southern China

20:45.948 --> 20:48.923
in Fujian province, to be precise?

20:48.947 --> 20:50.828
Well, now you have my attention, Doctor.

20:50.852 --> 20:53.159
It was her extremities
that gave her away.

20:53.183 --> 20:56.526
The Chinese dentistry
is quite distinctive.

20:56.550 --> 21:02.110
Her dental work is very new.
Five or maybe six weeks ago and...

21:02.163 --> 21:04.213
her feet are calloused.

21:04.237 --> 21:06.929
Indicates that she was a farm worker.

21:06.953 --> 21:12.310
We also found traces of chromium
six in her digestive tract.

21:12.334 --> 21:14.074
It's a by-product of chlorate.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.661
Causes cancer and respiratory problems.

21:16.685 --> 21:22.142
Guess where the biggest chlorate
chemical factory is in Asia.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.409
Fujian province.

21:23.433 --> 21:25.985
Well, there you have it,

21:26.676 --> 21:28.885
the body as road map.

21:28.909 --> 21:30.105
Anything else?

21:30.194 --> 21:31.293
Yes.

21:31.886 --> 21:33.765
Her likely killer...

21:34.460 --> 21:37.250
Sergeant Brian Wright.

21:37.274 --> 21:42.198
We had a positive DNA match from
the saliva we swabbed from her.

21:42.222 --> 21:46.211
I'm afraid our hero is more
than a little tarnished.

21:53.820 --> 21:55.055
How does a homeless guy

21:55.079 --> 21:57.872
staying illegally in a
hotel order room service?

21:57.896 --> 21:59.764
This wouldn't be a trick
question, would it, Probie?

21:59.788 --> 22:00.836
No.

22:00.860 --> 22:02.642
He calls room service.

22:04.502 --> 22:05.542
Room service, hi.

22:05.566 --> 22:09.405
This is the homeless guy
staying illegally in room 607.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.035
Yes, the room shut down for maintenance.

22:11.059 --> 22:12.506
I'd like to order some breakfast.

22:12.530 --> 22:14.376
That was definitely a trick question.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.248
So give me a tricky answer.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.996
Somebody brought it to him.

22:18.020 --> 22:19.476
Not very tricky.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.177
I got to talk to Ducky.

22:21.201 --> 22:23.532
I'm gonna go talk to Ducky.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.618
What is with everybody today?

22:29.929 --> 22:32.260
Hallway camera D.

22:33.332 --> 22:34.664
The title needs work, who's in it?

22:34.688 --> 22:36.863
Hopefully, the Asian
guy who booked the room.

22:36.952 --> 22:38.656
Looks like the doctor kept you...

22:38.680 --> 22:40.390
Busy waiting room.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.427
Lot of sleeping sickness going around.

22:43.451 --> 22:45.235
Or lack of sleeping sickness.

22:45.259 --> 22:47.503
Ducky thinks our victim
is a Chinese national.

22:47.527 --> 22:49.546
Probably in the country
less than a few weeks.

22:49.570 --> 22:52.727
Well, her fingerprints drew a
negative on the immigration database,

22:52.751 --> 22:55.031
so she's here illegally.

22:55.055 --> 22:56.723
Smuggled in, maybe for the sex trade.

22:56.747 --> 22:58.801
Asian, cute, underage.

22:58.825 --> 23:00.104
It's a gold mine.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.115
Pimp pays cash,

23:01.139 --> 23:03.427
sets her up in a room during
a nice, big convention,

23:03.451 --> 23:04.738
feeds her clients.

23:04.762 --> 23:05.934
And then one of them kills her.

23:05.958 --> 23:08.070
Sergeant Wright doesn't
fit that profile.

23:08.094 --> 23:09.825
Wright didn't need to
pay to get into the room.

23:09.849 --> 23:11.452
He had a magic key.

23:12.165 --> 23:14.122
He saw an opportunity, he took it.

23:14.146 --> 23:16.975
Perhaps because of his
mental state, he lost control,

23:16.999 --> 23:19.058
and afterwards, regret,
and he took his own life.

23:19.082 --> 23:20.192
Fits the facts, boss.

23:20.216 --> 23:22.283
Only the facts we know, DiNozzo.

23:22.307 --> 23:23.355
Any word from Abby?

23:23.379 --> 23:24.775
Not a peep.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.436
I've got to get one of these babies.

23:27.460 --> 23:30.400
Looks like trace elements of
aluminum hydroxide and formalin.

23:30.424 --> 23:33.173
Aluminum hydroxide stimulates
the immune system and..

23:33.197 --> 23:34.795
Formalin is a preservative.

23:34.819 --> 23:38.337
It's also used to initiate
antibody formation in vaccines.

23:40.172 --> 23:42.026
- Did I just say something funny?
- No.

23:42.050 --> 23:43.422
No, I-I just...

23:43.446 --> 23:45.655
it's just that we're having
this conversation about stuff

23:45.679 --> 23:48.065
that usually makes people
run screaming from the room,

23:48.089 --> 23:49.108
but...

23:49.321 --> 23:52.217
we're talking about it like it
was last night's football game.

23:52.241 --> 23:53.816
You don't like football, do you?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.940
- No.
- Oh, good.

23:56.020 --> 23:57.871
It's just nice that you understand

23:57.895 --> 24:00.174
without having to go find a dictionary.

24:00.198 --> 24:01.614
So you said vaccines?

24:01.638 --> 24:02.935
I said vaccines.

24:02.959 --> 24:04.381
That's got to be it.

24:04.664 --> 24:06.164
A vaccine for what?

24:06.188 --> 24:07.945
Aluminum hydroxide
is used as an adjuvant

24:07.969 --> 24:09.939
in hepatitis A and Lyme disease.

24:09.963 --> 24:11.720
There's traces of chloride.

24:11.744 --> 24:13.659
Not just any old chloride.

24:13.871 --> 24:15.265
Benzethonium chloride.

24:15.289 --> 24:16.606
It's a preservative.

24:16.630 --> 24:18.831
Aluminum hydroxide, formalin

24:18.855 --> 24:20.949
and benzethonium chloride.

24:20.973 --> 24:22.535
I know that combination.

24:22.559 --> 24:24.759
- How do you know that combination?
- I don't know.

24:24.783 --> 24:26.850
It must have come through
my lab or something.

24:26.874 --> 24:27.958
The only thing I can think of using

24:27.982 --> 24:31.318
benzethonium chloride for
as a preservative is...

24:32.368 --> 24:34.170
anthrax vaccine.

24:34.194 --> 24:35.401
Ooh, anthrax.

24:35.425 --> 24:37.457
Breathe in the spores and you die.

24:37.481 --> 24:39.845
You don't have an unhealthy
obsession with death now, do you?

24:39.869 --> 24:42.394
Oh, no, no, it's just a hobby.

24:42.572 --> 24:44.780
Anthrax vaccine, that's why I knew it.

24:44.804 --> 24:46.878
I got one right here.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.898
Ow, pain-memory response.

24:49.058 --> 24:51.165
So, good or bad for your Marine?

24:51.189 --> 24:52.264
It's bad.

24:52.288 --> 24:53.159
It's very bad.

24:53.183 --> 24:54.993
A lot of Marines were vaccinated

24:55.017 --> 24:56.464
for anthrax after 9/11.

24:56.488 --> 24:58.522
I have to make a phone call.

25:02.642 --> 25:03.832
Boss, hey.

25:03.856 --> 25:05.409
Sergeant Wright's autopsy report?

25:05.433 --> 25:08.579
Yeah, just, um, checking something.

25:08.796 --> 25:10.101
Something didn't fit.

25:10.125 --> 25:13.406
It's just a theory, but
it's about what Wright ate.

25:13.430 --> 25:14.204
What'd he eat?

25:14.228 --> 25:15.397
Nothing.

25:15.592 --> 25:18.085
Not since the night
before. I asked Ducky.

25:18.109 --> 25:21.297
But the room service tray
on the bed was half-finished,

25:21.321 --> 25:22.623
which raises another question.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.437
How did he get room service
if he wasn't supposed

25:24.461 --> 25:26.330
to be in the room in the first place?

25:26.658 --> 25:27.804
Yeah, go on.

25:27.828 --> 25:30.210
People leave trays outside their doors.

25:30.234 --> 25:32.177
I think that he found one
that was half-finished.

25:32.201 --> 25:34.038
He took it back to his room.

25:34.062 --> 25:36.455
Something must have happened
before he could eat it.

25:37.943 --> 25:39.609
Wright's begging note.

25:42.681 --> 25:44.288
Or somebody else's.

25:44.312 --> 25:46.581
Hidden under a plate on the tray?

25:46.627 --> 25:47.676
And he found it.

25:47.700 --> 25:49.466
Must be why he went back to the room.

25:49.490 --> 25:51.572
Once a hero, always a hero.

25:55.559 --> 25:56.222
McGee.

25:56.246 --> 25:57.614
McGee, it's Abby.

25:57.638 --> 25:59.842
I need you to pull
Wright's medical records.

25:59.866 --> 26:01.364
One second.

26:03.532 --> 26:04.544
Got it. What do you need?

26:04.568 --> 26:06.228
Check it for an anthrax vaccine.

26:06.252 --> 26:07.706
Let's see.

26:10.155 --> 26:10.920
It's a negative.

26:10.944 --> 26:11.833
Yes!

26:11.857 --> 26:14.004
Oh, McGee, it's not Wright's sample.

26:14.028 --> 26:15.663
I'll tell him. Thank you.

26:15.822 --> 26:16.454
Boss.

26:16.478 --> 26:18.267
A hair found on the victim

26:18.291 --> 26:19.782
indicates the killer
had an anthrax vaccine.

26:19.806 --> 26:21.367
Wright never had one.

26:23.804 --> 26:25.797
Chalk another one up to science.

26:26.648 --> 26:29.974
Ah, I could not have
done it without the IMS.

26:29.998 --> 26:31.061
And...

26:31.206 --> 26:32.055
and you.

26:32.079 --> 26:34.515
So... who do I make the receipt out to?

26:34.700 --> 26:36.315
Oh, um...

26:36.339 --> 26:37.974
Well, I feel really bad, Marty,

26:37.998 --> 26:39.988
and you worked really hard on this.

26:40.012 --> 26:41.430
I, um...

26:44.673 --> 26:46.046
Hmm. Do you bowl?

26:47.623 --> 26:49.124
Are you kidding me?

26:49.148 --> 26:51.308
I am the queen of the alley.

26:51.332 --> 26:53.005
You know, they got a bowling
alley right downstairs.

26:53.029 --> 26:54.272
In the hotel?

26:54.296 --> 26:56.351
Right next to the indoor pool.

26:56.901 --> 26:58.035
Or...

26:58.886 --> 27:00.348
we could do dinner.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.974
Oh, no.

27:02.399 --> 27:05.082
You're just afraid of getting
your butt kicked on the lanes.

27:05.106 --> 27:06.887
You are on, lady.

27:08.939 --> 27:10.944
I can't believe you bowl.

27:10.968 --> 27:11.750
Why not?

27:11.774 --> 27:14.623
Well, it's just, it's
such a coincidence.

27:14.747 --> 27:16.823
Are you a three-quarter
or a full-roller?

27:16.847 --> 27:18.299
Makes no difference to me.

27:18.323 --> 27:20.627
I got a delicate touch.

27:22.815 --> 27:23.872
So the hair wasn't Wright's,

27:23.896 --> 27:26.637
but the saliva
definitely was. DNA match.

27:26.661 --> 27:28.063
He was kissing the girl.

27:28.087 --> 27:29.995
There's more than one
reason to kiss a girl.

27:30.019 --> 27:31.278
There is?

27:39.425 --> 27:40.456
Autopsy.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.068
- Got a question for you.
- I can't guarantee...

27:42.092 --> 27:43.269
I got an answer.

27:43.293 --> 27:44.164
The bruising on the girl's

27:44.188 --> 27:46.238
sternum could it be from CPR?

27:46.262 --> 27:47.865
Very possibly.

27:48.547 --> 27:49.312
This is most

27:49.336 --> 27:51.510
probable when you weigh
all the other evidence.

27:51.534 --> 27:53.229
It would explain how Wright's

27:53.253 --> 27:55.728
saliva came to be on her.

27:55.752 --> 27:57.243
I'll have to confirm that, of course,

27:57.267 --> 28:00.234
but yes, that could be your answer: CPR.

28:00.258 --> 28:02.865
Which means Wright
wasn't trying to kill her.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.859
He was trying to save her.

28:04.883 --> 28:07.025
Let me know when you get a confirmation.

28:07.944 --> 28:10.246
So we're looking for someone
with an anthrax vaccine.

28:10.270 --> 28:11.332
Instead of one suspect,

28:11.356 --> 28:14.110
we now have half a million,
all of them military.

28:14.134 --> 28:14.969
Maintenance guy?

28:14.993 --> 28:16.338
Fixing a leak in the kitchen.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.168
Chefs were tripping over him all day.

28:18.192 --> 28:19.781
Scratch Romero.

28:19.805 --> 28:22.191
After 9/11, anthrax was
sent through the mail.

28:22.215 --> 28:24.557
Most people at risk were vaccinated.

28:24.581 --> 28:26.622
Pentagon officials,
senators, congressmen.

28:26.646 --> 28:28.017
Everybody at the reception.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.332
And people who open their mail.

28:30.389 --> 28:32.616
Yes, I had an anthrax vaccination,

28:32.640 --> 28:33.945
Along with...

28:33.969 --> 28:36.435
most everyone on the Hill, Agent Gibbs.

28:36.459 --> 28:38.821
They were troubling times.

28:39.087 --> 28:40.432
They still are.

28:40.456 --> 28:41.970
After you delivered the briefing papers

28:41.994 --> 28:43.985
to Norforce Systems, what did you do?

28:44.009 --> 28:45.876
I walked down the hallway

28:45.900 --> 28:47.684
toward the elevator and...

28:47.708 --> 28:49.596
that's where Wright attacked me.

28:49.711 --> 28:52.709
Norforce Systems' suite was
right next to the elevator.

28:52.733 --> 28:54.659
Do you want to try this again?

28:55.156 --> 28:56.328
Do I need a lawyer?

28:56.352 --> 28:58.532
Only if you're feeling guilty.

28:59.967 --> 29:01.362
You were walking towards
the elevator, because

29:01.386 --> 29:02.869
you were not coming
from Norforce Systems,

29:02.893 --> 29:04.855
you were coming from a
room down the hallway.

29:04.879 --> 29:05.751
- No.
- Yes...

29:05.775 --> 29:08.036
a room where an
underage girl was killed.

29:08.060 --> 29:09.613
And you think I'm responsible?

29:09.637 --> 29:10.975
If you're not...

29:11.605 --> 29:14.342
then you won't mind
giving us a hair sample.

29:14.431 --> 29:16.215
The killer left a calling card and...

29:16.239 --> 29:18.233
we think your name is on it.

29:35.429 --> 29:37.204
This is outrageous.

29:37.228 --> 29:38.134
I was attacked

29:38.158 --> 29:40.504
by a violent, unstable man.

29:40.528 --> 29:41.647
If you're looking for a murderer,

29:41.671 --> 29:43.570
you should be looking at him and not me.

29:43.594 --> 29:45.055
Are you refusing to voluntarily

29:45.079 --> 29:46.906
give us a hair sample, Mr. Nelson?

29:46.930 --> 29:48.749
'Cause if you are, we can
just get a court order.

29:48.773 --> 29:51.025
I didn't kill anyone.

29:52.894 --> 29:53.922
Boss.

30:00.993 --> 30:02.130
8:17.

30:02.154 --> 30:03.969
They're all reacting to the same thing.

30:03.993 --> 30:05.444
Wright dropping in for breakfast?

30:05.468 --> 30:06.508
Nelson might have killed the girl,

30:06.532 --> 30:08.888
but there's no way he
killed Wrigth, boss.

30:24.297 --> 30:26.371
I want to make a phone call.

30:27.101 --> 30:28.000
Lawyer?

30:28.024 --> 30:30.135
Someone much more powerful.

30:30.159 --> 30:31.515
Your boss?

30:32.640 --> 30:35.545
Underage, illegal, dead.

30:35.569 --> 30:38.014
You really think your
boss wants to talk to you?

30:39.756 --> 30:41.093
Did you kill her before or after

30:41.117 --> 30:42.702
you pushed Sergeant Wright?

30:42.800 --> 30:44.326
I didn't kill her.

30:44.350 --> 30:45.886
I didn't push Sergeant Wright.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.810
I was on the ground
floor when he jumped.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.455
He went to the room.

30:50.934 --> 30:52.934
Trying to save her, you attacked him.

30:52.958 --> 30:53.936
No.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.289
You raped her.

30:56.135 --> 30:57.863
You killed her.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.127
You threw Sergeant
Wright off of the balcony.

31:01.151 --> 31:04.265
I never saw Sergeant Wright!

31:05.426 --> 31:07.446
Then how did he attack you?

31:15.013 --> 31:16.992
She hit me with the lamp.

31:17.016 --> 31:18.392
I was just trying...

31:18.416 --> 31:20.249
just trying to stop her.

31:20.273 --> 31:23.248
I - I had to explain this
somehow, so I said...

31:23.272 --> 31:25.680
Wright... attacked me.

31:25.704 --> 31:27.338
Who took you up to her room?

31:27.362 --> 31:28.219
No one.

31:28.243 --> 31:29.546
I, uh...

31:30.849 --> 31:32.955
I met him o-outside the hotel.

31:32.979 --> 31:34.202
Pais him,

31:34.530 --> 31:36.429
and he gave me the key card.

31:36.453 --> 31:37.967
Regular client?

31:37.991 --> 31:39.940
Different girls every time?

31:41.287 --> 31:42.614
Different girls.

31:42.638 --> 31:45.646
I ran into him downstairs...

31:46.028 --> 31:47.507
at the elevator.

31:47.556 --> 31:49.335
And I told him she was dead.

31:49.359 --> 31:50.857
He went up.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.111
Name.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.113
Name!

31:57.325 --> 31:59.078
Davey Chen Importing Company.

31:59.102 --> 32:00.306
Kept himself pretty clean.

32:00.330 --> 32:01.865
A couple of misdemeanors, no felonies,

32:01.889 --> 32:03.119
nothing to suggest he was involved

32:03.143 --> 32:04.789
in the sex trade of underage girls.

32:04.813 --> 32:06.384
Got enough to arrest him for murder?

32:06.408 --> 32:07.571
No physical evidence.

32:07.595 --> 32:08.714
His word against Nelson's.

32:08.738 --> 32:10.916
Let's go kick his door
down and find some evidence.

32:10.940 --> 32:12.848
We do that, Tony, we lose those girls.

32:12.872 --> 32:13.964
Could have lost them already.

32:13.988 --> 32:16.118
Slave traders move
their girls all the time.

32:16.142 --> 32:18.803
They could be on their
way to Vegas now, or dead.

32:18.827 --> 32:20.767
Send someone in undercover.

32:21.068 --> 32:22.336
I'll do it.

32:22.477 --> 32:23.251
No.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.313
We need someone closer to home.

32:25.579 --> 32:27.035
- DiNozzo.
- Boss.

32:27.059 --> 32:28.558
Give me $25,000.

32:28.582 --> 32:29.312
Check or plastic?

32:29.336 --> 32:31.011
- Cash.
- On it.

32:32.123 --> 32:34.418
Mr. Palmer, where did you and...?

32:40.186 --> 32:41.861
Oh, sorry, Doctor.

32:42.215 --> 32:44.947
Where did you and Agent Lee go?

32:44.971 --> 32:46.978
I didn't go anywhere with Agent Lee.

32:47.129 --> 32:48.754
I signed Sergeant
Wright's medical records

32:48.778 --> 32:50.257
and then she left.

32:50.523 --> 32:52.999
Did she sprint out of here?

32:53.431 --> 32:54.925
She was in a hurry.

32:54.949 --> 32:56.874
Well, evidently so were you.

32:56.898 --> 32:59.701
When I looked up from washing my hands,

32:59.725 --> 33:01.536
both you and she had disappeared

33:01.560 --> 33:03.975
and Agent Gibbs was standing here.

33:04.519 --> 33:07.478
Where did you hurry off to?

33:09.060 --> 33:10.064
The restroom.

33:10.088 --> 33:13.096
And you've been in there all this time?

33:13.495 --> 33:18.207
I have a gastrointestinal challenge.

33:18.231 --> 33:21.309
Oh, well, I believe there's a bottle

33:21.333 --> 33:23.364
of subsalicylate...

33:23.388 --> 33:24.965
I drank that.

33:25.391 --> 33:26.436
What?

33:26.507 --> 33:27.418
All of it?

33:27.442 --> 33:28.756
I didn't want to spend the whole day

33:28.780 --> 33:29.739
sitting in the restroom.

33:29.763 --> 33:31.050
That won't hurt me, will it?

33:31.074 --> 33:32.372
Well, no, but you're going to feel

33:32.396 --> 33:34.994
as if you've been on
bread and water for a week.

33:35.018 --> 33:35.783
Pardon?

33:35.807 --> 33:37.219
Well, the old naval punishment

33:37.243 --> 33:38.734
of bread and water for a week

33:38.758 --> 33:40.134
was not to punish

33:40.158 --> 33:43.097
by depriving the
offending sailor of food,

33:43.121 --> 33:46.248
as much as to plug up his
gastrointestinal tract.

33:46.272 --> 33:48.799
Oh! That is awful!

33:48.823 --> 33:49.739
I... aw!

33:49.763 --> 33:52.646
Mr. Palmer, I'm not deaf.

33:52.670 --> 33:54.710
I'm sorry, Doctor.
It's just the thought of

33:54.734 --> 33:57.601
punishing someone that
way, just sound so...

33:57.805 --> 33:59.603
uncivilized.

33:59.676 --> 34:03.114
Did those doors just open and shut?

34:04.134 --> 34:05.808
I don't think so, no.

34:06.282 --> 34:08.002
Strange.

34:09.694 --> 34:11.706
Very strange.

34:13.589 --> 34:15.435
It's just that she's never
been undercover, boss.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.655
She's a highly trained
NCIS special agent.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.135
She's more probie than even Probie.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.039
She's got excellent back-up.

34:21.063 --> 34:22.091
Me?

34:22.530 --> 34:23.681
Ziva.

34:24.377 --> 34:26.777
You are causing quite
a stir on the Hill.

34:26.801 --> 34:27.908
Underage dead girls

34:27.931 --> 34:30.454
and congressional aides
make people nervous.

34:30.478 --> 34:31.487
Good.

34:32.029 --> 34:33.610
She looks the part.

34:33.672 --> 34:34.583
Just like a...

34:34.608 --> 34:35.618
Whore?

34:35.733 --> 34:37.230
Courtesan.

34:38.241 --> 34:40.013
Are you sure you're ready for this?

34:40.641 --> 34:42.036
I saw the girl in autopsy.

34:42.060 --> 34:43.841
Yeah, I'm ready.

34:44.603 --> 34:46.100
Okay. McGee.

34:46.206 --> 34:48.513
Separate radio transmitter and GPS

34:48.536 --> 34:49.913
built into the lining.

34:49.937 --> 34:52.043
Pressure switch on
the handle turns it off

34:52.068 --> 34:53.338
if they sweep for bugs.

34:53.362 --> 34:55.181
Turns it back on when they're finished.

34:55.205 --> 34:57.369
Chen's going to be
suspicious of everyone.

34:57.393 --> 35:00.628
Particularly if someone
like Agent Lee shows up.

35:00.867 --> 35:02.842
We need something else, McGee.

35:02.958 --> 35:04.483
Got just the thing.

35:12.196 --> 35:13.933
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey.

35:25.359 --> 35:26.239
DiNozzo...

35:26.263 --> 35:27.787
In position, boss.

35:28.224 --> 35:29.721
What's the problem?

35:30.138 --> 35:31.922
Don't worry, I'll fix it.

35:31.946 --> 35:33.603
But tell me this...

35:34.431 --> 35:36.753
Why is he asking you about this?

35:37.045 --> 35:38.915
How can you be so stupid?

35:39.433 --> 35:41.471
You have to listen to me!

35:41.555 --> 35:43.505
Target has entered the building.

35:48.343 --> 35:50.284
GPS locked on.

35:50.337 --> 35:53.139
MTAC standing by, Agent
Gibbs. It's your call.

35:53.163 --> 35:54.856
We are in play.

35:57.802 --> 35:59.342
Excuse me.

35:59.441 --> 36:00.897
We're closed.

36:00.921 --> 36:02.975
Even for a cash customer,

36:02.999 --> 36:04.692
Mr. Chen?

36:07.354 --> 36:08.790
What do you want?

36:11.430 --> 36:12.848
And who are you?

36:12.941 --> 36:15.449
I don't know you or your sister.

36:17.035 --> 36:19.525
Maybe this will help you remember.

36:21.037 --> 36:22.317
Lee's killed the transmission.

36:22.341 --> 36:24.035
They're sweeping her for bugs.

36:24.059 --> 36:26.508
She'll resume the
transmission when it's clear.

36:27.059 --> 36:27.730
Stand by, Tony.

36:27.754 --> 36:29.529
No contact in 30
seconds, we're going in.

36:29.553 --> 36:30.686
Got you, boss.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.541
15 seconds.

36:36.039 --> 36:37.564
20 seconds...

36:40.009 --> 36:41.554
25 seconds.

36:41.578 --> 36:43.966
Come on, Lee, turn us back on.

36:45.933 --> 36:47.363
$25,000.

36:47.387 --> 36:50.362
Another 25 when I get my sister back.

36:50.386 --> 36:52.975
And what makes you
think I have your sister?

36:54.635 --> 36:57.603
Must be another Davey
Chen I'm looking for.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.137
What's her name?

37:02.021 --> 37:04.911
She's 14 years old from Fujian Province.

37:04.935 --> 37:06.533
I don't know what you call her,

37:06.557 --> 37:08.421
by my family calls her Xiu Mei.

37:08.445 --> 37:09.945
You're a long way from home.

37:09.969 --> 37:11.110
So is she.

37:11.134 --> 37:14.089
But I wasn't abducted
off my parent's farm.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.174
Too old.

37:19.033 --> 37:21.621
That's a lot of money for
the daughter of a farmer.

37:22.015 --> 37:24.011
I work in Shanghai.
I'm good at what I do.

37:24.035 --> 37:26.712
American businessmen
show their appreciation.

37:26.736 --> 37:28.987
Do we have a deal?

37:31.065 --> 37:32.332
Come with me.

37:38.854 --> 37:40.138
Game on.

37:48.689 --> 37:49.950
We've lost the signal.

37:49.974 --> 37:51.578
She turned it off?

37:51.963 --> 37:53.434
I can't tell.

37:54.692 --> 37:56.350
Who do you work for?

37:57.980 --> 37:59.850
I'm here for my sister.

38:06.931 --> 38:08.343
Talk to me, McGee.

38:08.367 --> 38:10.254
Yeah, working on it, boss.

38:24.113 --> 38:25.460
FBI?

38:25.717 --> 38:26.931
Police?

38:27.396 --> 38:30.009
You don't think I came alone, do you?

38:31.003 --> 38:32.669
You're alone now.

38:33.001 --> 38:34.693
They can't hear you.

38:34.835 --> 38:36.140
This room...

38:36.164 --> 38:38.318
is protected against bugs.

38:41.414 --> 38:42.915
That's her back-up camera.

38:42.939 --> 38:44.235
There's interference.

38:44.259 --> 38:46.556
They're in a screened room.
It's jamming the signal.

38:46.580 --> 38:48.160
Gibbs, we've got a problem.

38:48.184 --> 38:50.878
DiNozzo, cover the back
door. We're going in.

38:51.605 --> 38:52.757
Got it.

38:53.005 --> 38:53.991
She's moving.

38:54.015 --> 38:55.610
Exiting a door.

39:09.659 --> 39:11.768
Clear.

39:21.652 --> 39:22.725
Clear.

39:23.075 --> 39:24.699
DiNozzo, they're gone. Anything?

39:24.723 --> 39:26.830
Nothing, boss. They
didn't come out this way.

39:26.854 --> 39:29.759
We're only getting
intermittent video signals.

39:29.783 --> 39:31.655
Aerial surveillance is negative.

39:31.679 --> 39:33.859
They're definitely on the move.

39:35.976 --> 39:38.687
Gibbs, check for a basement entrance.

39:38.711 --> 39:40.175
They've gone underground.

39:40.199 --> 39:41.539
What exactly are we looking for?

39:41.563 --> 39:42.718
Trapdoor.

39:42.742 --> 39:44.027
Anything.

39:48.098 --> 39:50.119
All right, we're getting picture back.

39:52.901 --> 39:55.666
Maybe some kind of tunnel.

40:04.434 --> 40:05.594
There.

40:06.179 --> 40:07.633
Playing it back.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.786
T- O-L-L...

40:13.810 --> 40:15.131
something.

40:15.155 --> 40:16.656
Could be an I.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.834
Maybe a K.

40:17.858 --> 40:19.462
Toll...

40:19.834 --> 40:21.334
Toll Bridge Trading.

40:21.358 --> 40:23.166
Women's shoes.

40:26.210 --> 40:28.795
2570 Third Street Northwest.

40:28.819 --> 40:31.166
Jethro, 2570.

40:31.190 --> 40:33.906
- Third Street, Northwest.
- Gibbs.

40:39.169 --> 40:39.659
Clear.

40:39.683 --> 40:41.382
Tony, go, go. We've got the tunnel.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.170
Okay, two minutes, boss.

41:04.395 --> 41:06.681
What is this, a warehouse?

41:07.585 --> 41:09.774
He's shutting down his operation.

41:14.966 --> 41:16.623
Where are the girls?

41:16.809 --> 41:19.054
Put her in the truck
along with the others.

41:19.559 --> 41:21.190
Federal agents!

41:21.677 --> 41:22.918
Freeze!

41:29.961 --> 41:31.485
Stay down.

41:38.059 --> 41:39.685
Put the weapon down.

41:45.831 --> 41:47.506
Nice work, Probie.

41:55.405 --> 41:57.142
They're in the truck.

42:05.912 --> 42:07.605
Unbelievable.

42:18.950 --> 42:21.059
"The bum tried to be a hero."

42:22.304 --> 42:23.726
Brian Wright.

42:24.107 --> 42:26.065
Sergeant Brian Wright.

42:27.049 --> 42:29.807
Bronze Star, Purple Heart,

42:29.831 --> 42:32.069
United States Marine Corps.

42:33.252 --> 42:34.734
He was a hero.
