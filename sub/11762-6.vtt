WEBVTT

00:00.601 --> 00:05.036
в™Єв™Є

00:05.036 --> 00:07.278
UGH. COME ON, JULES.
IT'S A GAME.

00:07.278 --> 00:08.779
JUST PICK ANY CELEBRITY

00:08.779 --> 00:11.382
YOU'D WANNA HAVE SEX WITH
FOR AN HOUR.

00:11.382 --> 00:13.684
AN HOUR? NO ONE.

00:13.684 --> 00:17.448
OKAY, 15 MINUTES.
DAN RATHER.
IT'S A LONG STORY.

00:17.448 --> 00:19.420
ARE YOU REALLY WEARING
THAT T-SHIRT?

00:19.420 --> 00:22.423
YEAH. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO OHIO,
BUT I DO LOVE THIS SHIRT,

00:22.423 --> 00:24.695
BECAUSE THE O's FRAME
MY BOOBS PERFECTLY,

00:24.695 --> 00:27.198
AND IT SAYS "HI"
IN THE MIDDLE.
(dog barking in distance)

00:27.198 --> 00:29.200
OH, HEY, TRAVIS.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.102
"OHIO."

00:31.102 --> 00:32.803
TRAVIS, EYES UP.

00:35.066 --> 00:37.068
HEY,
THAT IS A BITCHIN' PURSE.

00:37.068 --> 00:39.039
DID YOU GET THAT
ON THE INTERNET?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.541
BECAUSE I JUST BOUGHT

00:40.541 --> 00:42.543
THIS BADASS HUMIDIFIER
ON THE INTERNET,

00:42.543 --> 00:45.045
AND IT IS REALLY HELPING
WITH MY SINUS INFECTCH.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.047
IT'S COLD MIST,
SO LESS BACTERIA, YOU KNOW?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.149
NO BIGGIE.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.481
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:50.481 --> 00:52.383
GREAT STUFF, MOMS.

00:52.383 --> 00:54.385
AND I'M OUT!
(makes whooshing sound)

00:54.385 --> 00:55.526
(laughs)

00:55.526 --> 00:56.827
WHAT A DOOF.
(door opens)

00:56.827 --> 01:00.631
HE IS SO CRUSHING ON YOU.

01:00.631 --> 01:02.393
IT'S KINDA SWEET.

01:02.393 --> 01:06.367
YEAH. DO YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE HIS VIRGINITY?
NOW NOT SO SWEET.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.570
NO, AS, LIKE, A FAVOR TO YOU.
PLUS IT'S KINDA MY HOBBY.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.572
HONEY, I'M HOPING
MY SON'S FIRST TIME

01:11.572 --> 01:15.075
IS A LITTLE MORE ROMANTIC,
A LITTLE LESS "HOLD ON TIGHT!"

01:15.075 --> 01:18.149
HOW DARE YOU.

01:18.149 --> 01:20.151
(sighs) SO WHERE'S
HANDSOME BORING GUY?

01:20.151 --> 01:21.452
JOSH ISN'T BORING.

01:21.452 --> 01:26.086
DEEP DOWN, HE'S REALLY...
OKAY, I GOT NOTHIN'.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.589
LAURIE, YOU HAVE TO
STAY WITH ME, OKAY?

01:28.589 --> 01:30.591
THESE ARE ALL HIS FRIENDS,

01:30.591 --> 01:33.093
AND THEY'RE ALL, LIKE,
12 YEARS OLD.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.595
LAURIE?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.327
YOU'RE FUNNY.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

01:36.327 --> 01:38.869
IT TAKES ME 20 MINUTES
TO GET IN A HAMMOCK.

01:38.869 --> 01:40.331
OHIO.

01:40.331 --> 01:42.473
STACEY!
OHH!

01:42.473 --> 01:44.875
SORRY. THOUGHT YOU WERE
MY ROOMMATE.

01:44.875 --> 01:48.108
YOU THOUGHT MY BUTT WAS YOUNG
ENOUGH TO BE YOUR ROOMMATE'S?

01:48.108 --> 01:51.542
WE NEED TO HUG. WOW.

01:51.542 --> 01:53.113
JULES?

01:53.113 --> 01:56.547
I MADE A NEW FRIEND.
NICE.

01:56.547 --> 01:59.550
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF HAVING
A BOAT YARD SALE BEFORE?

01:59.550 --> 02:01.622
I MADE 12 BUCKS ALREADY.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.624
DAD, WE'VE BEEN HERE
ALL MORNING,

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
AND THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S BOUGHT ANYTHING

02:05.626 --> 02:08.128
IS YOUR ONE
PSYCHOTIC SUPERFAN.

02:08.128 --> 02:12.132
I'M GONNA BUY THE PICTURE, TOO.
LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE MAGNIFICENT.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.634
FOR YOU, 30 BUCKS.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.865
I'M PAYING $40.

02:14.865 --> 02:16.867
DONE.

02:16.867 --> 02:19.210
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS
A SAD DAY.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.512
WELL, I'M A LITTLE STRAPPED
FOR CASH, BUD.

02:21.512 --> 02:24.515
YOU KNOW, I ONLY GOT FOUR
GOLF LESSONS BOOKED THIS MONTH.

02:24.515 --> 02:28.379
SO I GOTTA COME UP WITH NEW WAYS
TO BRING IN THE DOUBLOONS.

02:28.379 --> 02:31.722
THAT'S BOAT SLANG
FOR MONEY.
GOT IT.

02:31.722 --> 02:32.883
в™Єв™Є

02:32.883 --> 02:36.156
(cheering)
YES! CHUG IT!

02:36.156 --> 02:38.359
IN YOUR FACE, SULLY.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.431
I LOVE THIS GAME!

02:40.431 --> 02:43.264
I FORFEIT.

02:43.264 --> 02:46.767
(crowd) CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG,
CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG!

02:46.767 --> 02:49.840
HEY, HEY! ALL THE CHANTING'S
NOT GONNA MAKE ME DO IT.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.843
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE
SOMETHING ABOUT PEER PRESSURE.

02:52.843 --> 02:55.846
PEER PRESSURE IS WHY
I LOST MY VIRGINITY AT 15

02:55.846 --> 02:58.178
WITH FRANCIS COOPER
IN HIS MOM'S BATHTUB.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.850
(crowd laughing and murmuring)

02:59.850 --> 03:01.912
I'VE NEVER TOLD THAT STORY
BEFORE.

03:01.912 --> 03:05.686
YOU ALL PRESSURED ME INTO IT.
JULES, I-I GOT IT.
PLEASE STOP.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.187
THIS IS FUN!

03:07.187 --> 03:09.690
I HAVEN'T DRANK
OUT OF A RED PLASTIC CUP

03:09.690 --> 03:11.191
SINCE MY WEDDING RECEPTION.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.893
в™Єв™Є

03:12.893 --> 03:15.966
SO HE JUST HUGGED YOU SWEETLY
FROM BEHIND

03:15.966 --> 03:18.829
AND DIDN'T HONK A BOOB
TO SHOW OFF TO HIS FRIENDS?

03:18.829 --> 03:22.673
NOPE, NO HONKS.
WHAT IS WITH THE KNOWING LOOK?

03:22.673 --> 03:25.676
YOU KNOW I HATE KNOWING LOOKS
UNLESS I'M GIVING THEM.

03:25.676 --> 03:28.979
JULES, THAT BOY IS IN L-O-V-E,
LOVE. USED TO BE A CHEERLEADER.

03:28.979 --> 03:31.211
NO, YOU WEREN'T.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.444
OKAY, I SLEPT WITH A LOT
OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS. SAME DIFF.

03:33.444 --> 03:35.886
SLUTTY DUMMY'S RIGHT
FOR A CHANGE. JOSH IS IN LOVE.

03:35.886 --> 03:37.418
HOLLA!

03:37.418 --> 03:39.850
NO "HOLLA," LAURIE.
THIS IS NOT A "HOLLA" MOMENT.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.453
WE'RE HAVING FUN.
HE DOESN'T LOVE ME.

03:42.453 --> 03:45.225
HEY, GRAYSON,
IF YOU WERE AT A BARBECUE

03:45.225 --> 03:47.227
PLAYING DRINKING GAMES
WITH YOUR BUDS,

03:47.227 --> 03:50.230
WOULD YOU CHUG A GIRL'S BEER,
THEN HUG HER SWEETLY FROM BEHIND

03:50.230 --> 03:52.863
WITHOUT TRYING TO COP A FEEL
IN FRONT OF THEM

03:52.863 --> 03:55.966
IF YOU WEREN'T TOTALLY
IN LOVE?
PLEASE STOP COMING TO MY BAR.

03:55.966 --> 03:59.540
MAN'S GOT A POINT.
YEAH, HE'S GOT A NICE ASS,
TOO.

04:02.012 --> 04:04.014
YOU DON'T LOVE ME,
RIGHT?

04:04.014 --> 04:05.376
WHAT? NO.

04:05.376 --> 04:07.348
HOLLA!
OH, THAT'S FUN TO SAY.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.521
JOSH, DO ME A FAVOR. DON'T FALL
IN LOVE WITH ME, OKAY?

04:10.521 --> 04:11.952
OH, MY GOD.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.726
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST
ARROGANT THING I'VE EVER SAID.

04:15.726 --> 04:16.987
EW! MMM.

04:16.987 --> 04:19.760
BUT SERIOUSLY, DON'T.
THAT WOULD BE A HUGE HASSLE.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.492
OKAY.

04:23.334 --> 04:25.436
WHOA, TRAVIS.

04:25.436 --> 04:27.338
REALLY FILLING OUT.

04:27.338 --> 04:29.740
I THINK I SEE A VEIN
ON THAT BICEP.

04:29.740 --> 04:32.873
(grunts) YEAH, JUST GOING
FOR A POST-WORKOUT SWIM.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.845
(chuckles)

04:34.845 --> 04:37.848
HEY, CAN YOU THANK JULES
FOR LETTING ME USE THE POOL?

04:37.848 --> 04:41.552
NO, JOSH. THANK YOU.

04:41.552 --> 04:44.555
HEY, CAN YOU ASK YOUR MOM
TO GIVE ME A CALL LATER?

04:44.555 --> 04:46.557
YEAH, NO, NO,
I CAN'T, JOSH,

04:46.557 --> 04:49.760
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO
SHOOT MYSELF.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.993
I TOLD YOU
JOSH DIDN'T LOVE ME.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.866
ALL HE WANTS IS, WELL...

04:55.866 --> 04:58.799
ALL OF THIS
WITH A SIDE OF THIS.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.872
HOLY CRAP, JULES. YOU ARE
FINALLY SOMEONE'S BOOTY CALL.

05:01.872 --> 05:02.933
(scoffs)

05:02.933 --> 05:04.935
ALL THAT HARD WORK
FINALLY PAID OFF!

05:04.935 --> 05:08.909
OH, THE SPIN CLASSES,
THE EXPENSIVE BODY CREAMS,

05:08.909 --> 05:11.612
THE NOT EATING CANDY.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.515
YOU KNOW, I SUCK ON CHOCOLATE
FOR, LIKE, THREE SECONDS,

05:14.515 --> 05:16.517
AND THEN I... (spits)
I SPIT IT OUT.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.519
(telephone rings)
OH, THAT'S HIM!

05:18.519 --> 05:21.922
(singsongy) HELLO?
IS SOMEONE CALLING FOR A BOOTY?

05:21.922 --> 05:25.696
JULES, I LIED BEFORE.
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU.

05:25.696 --> 05:26.997
I LOVE YOU.

05:26.997 --> 05:31.031
NOT MUCH.
JUST HANGING WITH MY GIRLS.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.433
(mouths word)

05:32.433 --> 05:34.935
JULES, I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.968
OH, YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE ALL ON THAT ISLAND.

05:37.968 --> 05:39.670
I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.972
I TELL YOU.
THEY'RE NOT GETTING OFF.
(click)

05:41.972 --> 05:44.615
Jules, I'm telling you
that I love you.

05:44.615 --> 05:46.747
Please say something real.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.881
(line disconnects)
WHOA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:50.881 --> 05:53.454
I GOT VERY NERVOUS.
THAT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.456
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN!

05:55.456 --> 05:57.488
LAURIE,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

05:57.488 --> 05:59.490
JOSH HAS FEELINGS.
HE'S A HUMAN BEING.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.961
(telephone rings)

06:02.062 --> 06:04.865
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY YET!

06:13.504 --> 06:16.747
YOU HAVE TO COLD DUMP
JOSH'S ASS, LIKE, YESTERDAY.
MM-HMM.

06:16.747 --> 06:19.810
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE FELL IN LOVE.
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HIM NOT TO.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.653
AND HE DID THE OPPOSITE?
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

06:22.653 --> 06:26.717
SARCASM?
NO, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
IT WOULD BE SO RUDE.

06:26.717 --> 06:29.059
SO, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING
TO THE BREAKUP?
WHAT?

06:29.059 --> 06:31.762
THIS IS HOW HE'S GONNA
REMEMBER YOU FOREVER.
MM-HMM.

06:31.762 --> 06:33.764
I LIKE TO DO IT
AFTER SEX.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.896
IT'S WHEN MY HAIR
LOOKS THE BEST.
OH.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.898
I'VE NEVER BROKEN UP
WITH ANYONE BEFORE.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.901
I MEAN, I DATED THIS GUY FRANCIS
FROM 15 TO 19,

06:40.901 --> 06:43.834
AND THEN I MET BOBBY.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH FRANCIS?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.836
DID YOU DUMP HIM
OR DID HE DUMP YOU?

06:45.836 --> 06:49.540
NEITHER. HE'S STILL IN A COMA
FROM HIS TRACTOR ACCIDENT.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.682
OH, I WANNA GO SEE FRANCIS.

06:51.682 --> 06:54.014
DON'T BE SUCH A BABY.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.016
FINE, I'LL DO IT,
BUT NOT TODAY.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.018
I MEAN, HOW HEARTLESS
WOULD IT BE TO BREAK UP

06:58.018 --> 07:00.190
WITH SOMEONE FIVE MONTHS
BEFORE THEIR BIRTHDAY?

07:00.190 --> 07:01.552
JULES!

07:01.552 --> 07:02.923
OKAY!

07:04.995 --> 07:07.498
THE FOLLOW-THROUGH IS
LOOKING MUCH BETTER, GLADYS.

07:07.498 --> 07:09.930
YOU GO, GLADYS.
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT ONE DAY!

07:09.930 --> 07:11.962
SHE NEVER WILL.
NO.

07:11.962 --> 07:14.465
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU NEED,
BOBBY?

07:14.465 --> 07:16.467
I GOTTA GO BREAK UP
WITH SOMEONE.

07:16.467 --> 07:19.439
SO, UH, TRAV PROBABLY FILLED YOU
IN ON MY LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.942
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
THE BOAT YARD SALE DID OKAY.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.474
(hammering)

07:23.474 --> 07:24.915
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:24.915 --> 07:29.079
SO I CAN'T CHOOSE
ONE THING IN HERE?

07:29.079 --> 07:30.821
COME ON!

07:30.821 --> 07:33.123
BUT FINANCIALLY,
I'M STILL IN THE RED.

07:33.123 --> 07:34.825
WAIT. IS THAT RIGHT?

07:34.825 --> 07:36.587
YES, BOBBY,
RED IS THE BAD COLOR.

07:36.587 --> 07:39.590
ANYWAY, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
GIVE ME SOME LIFE ADVICE?

07:39.590 --> 07:41.762
YOU KNOW, HELP ME GET BACK
ON TRACK?

07:41.762 --> 07:45.165
OH, MY GOD. I HAVE PRAYED
FOR THIS MOMENT.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.237
WAIT.
ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME?

07:47.237 --> 07:49.940
NO! I'M BRINGING THE REAL.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.201
AND IN RETURN,

07:51.201 --> 07:54.204
I'M GONNA GIVE YOUR SWING
A TUNE-UP. GET IN HERE.

07:54.204 --> 07:57.778
NO, NO, LET'S NOT PLAY GOLF.
LET'S FIX YOUR LIFE.
RUSS! HEY.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.150
JULES, YOU REMEMBER
MY OLD GOLF BUDDY RUSS.

08:00.150 --> 08:02.252
OH, OF COURSE, RUSS.
I LOVE RUSS.

08:02.252 --> 08:04.084
WE NEVER REALLY MET.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.787
WHY NOT JUST GO WITH IT,
RUSS?
HEY.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.218
HERE'S YOUR CASH, BOBBY.

08:08.218 --> 08:09.560
MERCI BEAUCOUP.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.592
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.594
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
JUST TAKE IT.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.066
BOBBY, I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
TROUBLE YOU'RE IN.

08:16.066 --> 08:18.569
(lowers voice) I'M NOT
HIDING THIS IN MY BUTT.

08:18.569 --> 08:21.031
OH, THAT HAPPENED ONCE.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, YOU KNOW,

08:21.031 --> 08:23.604
BACK IN '99, RUSS BET ME
1,000 BUCKS THAT IN 10 YEARS

08:23.604 --> 08:26.707
WE WOULDN'T STILL BE MARRIED.
THAT'S YOUR SHARE.
SO THIS WAS JUST ALL A CON?

08:26.707 --> 08:28.208
YOU'RE WELCOME, BABY.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.110
(whack)
THAT'S A SWING, GLADYS!

08:30.110 --> 08:32.112
GONNA MAKE THAT FAKE HIP
YOUR BITCH.

08:32.112 --> 08:37.047
HERE, HAVE A SEAT, JOSH.

08:37.047 --> 08:40.050
OKAY, I'M GONNA TRY TO
MAKE THIS AS SHORT AND CONCISE

08:40.050 --> 08:41.752
AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

08:41.752 --> 08:43.523
(inhales deeply)

08:43.523 --> 08:44.855
JOSH...

08:44.855 --> 08:47.157
PEOPLE GO THROUGH MANY PHASES
IN THEIR LIVES,

08:47.157 --> 08:49.860
LIKE MOVING OUT ON THEIR OWN
OR MENOPAUSE.

08:49.860 --> 08:52.032
NOT SURE WHY I WENT
WITH MENOPAUSE.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.534
THAT'S YEARS AWAY FOR ME.
LIKE, AT LEAST FOUR.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.867
FOUR? OH, MY GOD.
AM I THAT OLD, JOSH?

08:56.867 --> 08:58.869
WELL,
HERE'S A CRAZY QUESTION.

08:58.869 --> 09:02.042
UM, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
SO INTO SOMEONE

09:02.042 --> 09:05.816
THAT YOU ACTUALLY DON'T WANT
TO SEE THEM ANYMORE,

09:05.816 --> 09:07.818
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE AS FRIENDS?

09:07.818 --> 09:10.120
SO MANY THINGS IN LIFE
ARE ABOUT TIMING.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.122
I MEAN, NOT JUST RELATIONSHIPS,
JOSH.

09:12.122 --> 09:16.126
SOFT-BOILED EGGS,
HORSE RACES--

09:16.126 --> 09:18.929
I MEAN, THOSE ARE REALLY
THE TWO THAT COME TO MIND.

09:18.929 --> 09:20.931
LOOK, JOSH,
YOU ARE A GREAT GUY.

09:20.931 --> 09:24.064
I MEAN, YOU ARE EASILY IN
THE TOP 10 TO 15 GUYS

09:24.064 --> 09:25.766
THAT I'VE EVER MET
IN MY LIFE,

09:25.766 --> 09:27.868
AND THAT INCLUDES TOM PETTY
AND COLONEL SANDERS.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.871
OH! I'M JUST IN A BAD PLACE
IN MY LIFE, JOSH.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.774
IT'S LIKE AN OUTLET MALL.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.777
I MEAN, YOU THINK YOU'RE
GETTING A DEAL, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.149
THEY'RE JUST SELLING YOU
POOR QUALITY STUFF.

09:39.149 --> 09:41.281
IT'S LIKE A TRICK,
IS WHAT IT IS.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.053
ARE YOU DUMPING ME?

09:43.053 --> 09:45.956
NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T BE SAD.
SO YOU'RE NOT?

09:45.956 --> 09:48.959
NO, I AM.

09:48.959 --> 09:51.221
SO I'LL CALL YOU TWO TOMORROW
ABOUT THOSE LISTINGS.

09:51.221 --> 09:53.694
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.929
YOU OKAY DOWN THERE,
SWEETHEART?

09:58.929 --> 10:00.270
THEY DIDN'T SEE ME,
DID THEY?

10:00.270 --> 10:03.674
THEY DID,
BUT THEY ROLLED WITH IT.
I MURDERED JOSH.

10:03.674 --> 10:05.976
OH, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW BAD IT WAS.

10:05.976 --> 10:07.978
I DO. I WAS WATCHING.

10:07.978 --> 10:10.941
DID THE WORD "MENOPAUSE"
COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

10:10.941 --> 10:13.944
AT SOME POINT?
IT MAY HAVE.
I NEED SOME CHOCOLATE.

10:13.944 --> 10:16.647
OKAY. OH, HONEY,
THERE'S NOTHING IN YOUR PURSE

10:16.647 --> 10:18.088
EXCEPT FOR $300.

10:18.088 --> 10:21.752
THAT'S $500. THAT'S MY HALF
OF A STUPID BET BOBBY MADE.

10:21.752 --> 10:23.754
NO, THIS FEELS LIKE $300.

10:23.754 --> 10:26.296
MY BROTHER SOLD POT
FOR SIX YEARS, SO...

10:26.296 --> 10:28.999
ALL RIGHT, IF BOBBY WANTS
TO PLAY ROUGH,

10:28.999 --> 10:30.300
THEN I'LL PLAY ROUGH.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.002
GET MY FLATS.

10:32.002 --> 10:34.965
OH! CHOCOLATE. (gasps)

10:34.965 --> 10:37.137
ONE, TWO, THREE.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.140
(spits) ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!
COME ON!

10:40.140 --> 10:43.073
PUT IT ON MY TAB.

10:43.073 --> 10:45.375
OOH, YEAH, REMEMBER, UM,
HOW WE TALKED ABOUT

10:45.375 --> 10:49.049
HOW YOU DON'T HAVE A TAB?
YEP. THAT'S WHY
I JUST STARTED ONE.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.051
OKAY, WELL,
REMEMBER HOW WE TALKED ABOUT

10:51.051 --> 10:52.983
JUST SAYING
THE WORD "TAB" DOESN'T MEAN

10:52.983 --> 10:54.985
THAT YOU'VE MAGICALLY
CREATED ONE?

10:54.985 --> 10:57.087
RIGHT. HEY, THANKS FOR THIS.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.389
SO I SET UP THAT TEE TIME
FOR TOMORROW.

10:59.389 --> 11:02.292
IT'S GONNA BE US
AGAINST TWO OTHER DUDES.
OH, CAN WE PLEASE NOT BET
THIS TIME?

11:02.292 --> 11:04.294
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
THE PRESSURE.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.066
BETTING TAKES
THE PRESSURE OFF.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.769
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE
FOR ANYONE.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.001
(cell phone rings)

11:11.001 --> 11:13.243
(ring)
HEY, ANDY. IT'S ANDY.

11:13.243 --> 11:16.676
I GOT THAT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SHE STOLE THEM?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.409
YOU SAW NOTHING.

11:21.852 --> 11:23.754
OH, JOSH, DON'T BE SAD.

11:23.754 --> 11:25.756
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO THE GYM?

11:25.756 --> 11:28.989
THAT ALWAYS CHEERS YOU UP.
WELL, GO AGAIN AND JUST DO ABS.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.962
AND REMEMBER,
WHO IS AN AMAZING PERSON?

11:31.962 --> 11:35.265
OH, THANKS,
BUT I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

11:35.265 --> 11:37.968
OKAY, CALL ME LATER.
BYE.

11:37.968 --> 11:40.801
(beep)
YOU DUMPED HIM.
WHY ARE YOU TAKING HIS CALLS?

11:40.801 --> 11:43.273
I MIGHT HAVE CALLED HIM.

11:43.273 --> 11:45.275
WELL, I'M THE ONE
WHO HURT JOSH.

11:45.275 --> 11:48.178
SO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
HELP HIM THROUGH THIS.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.140
(cell phone rings)
EXCUSE ME.

11:50.140 --> 11:53.043
IF YOU ANSWER THAT, I WILL BREAK
YOUR NOSE WITH MY FOREHEAD.
(ring, beep)

11:53.043 --> 11:56.046
IGNORE.
YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING NICE
TO THAT BOY, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

11:56.046 --> 11:59.089
IF YOU KEEP TALKING TO HIM,
HE WILL NEVER MOVE ON.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.151
NO, NO,
SHE'S DOING IT PERFECTLY.

12:01.151 --> 12:03.153
YOU'RE LEAVING A TRAIL
OF BREAD CRUMBS

12:03.153 --> 12:05.155
LEADING RIGHT BACK
TO YOUR DOOR.

12:05.155 --> 12:07.157
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU COME FROM?

12:07.157 --> 12:10.300
SHH. BARB'S TALKING. TRUST ME.
ONE NIGHT--ONE NIGHT VERY SOON,

12:10.300 --> 12:12.302
YOU'LL BE SITTING
IN YOUR BEDROOM

12:12.302 --> 12:14.805
SIPPING A GLASS OF WINE,

12:14.805 --> 12:17.337
PERHAPS ENJOYING
SOME CHOCOLATES,

12:17.337 --> 12:20.070
AND THEN YOU'LL HEAR
THE PLINK, PLINK...
(tapping)

12:20.070 --> 12:23.013
OF LITTLE STONES
HITTING YOUR WINDOW.

12:23.013 --> 12:25.375
(gasps) "WHAT'S THAT?"
YOU'LL WONDER,

12:25.375 --> 12:28.248
AND HEART RACING,
YOU'LL GO LOOK,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.250
AND THERE,
STANDING ON YOUR LAWN,

12:30.250 --> 12:33.083
YOU'LL SEE HIM--

12:33.083 --> 12:35.255
A DESPERATE, BROKEN BOY

12:35.255 --> 12:39.059
CRYING IN THE RAIN,
BEGGING FOR YOUR LOVE.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.092
JULES, I LOVE YOU!

12:42.092 --> 12:44.764
(Dashboard Confessional's "You
Have Stolen My Heart" plays)

12:44.764 --> 12:48.839
(laughs) OH, THERE ISN'T
A WOMAN IN THE WORLD

12:48.839 --> 12:51.771
WHO CAN RESIST THE SCENT
OF WOUNDED BOY.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.875
THAT IS HORRIBLE,
AND, FRANKLY, BARB,

12:54.875 --> 12:57.848
I WOULD NEVER BE TURNED ON
BY THAT.

12:57.848 --> 13:01.181
в™Є YOU HAVE STOLEN MY в™Є

13:01.181 --> 13:03.053
IT HURTS.

13:03.053 --> 13:05.315
LET ME MAKE IT BETTER.

13:05.315 --> 13:12.192
в™Є YOU HAVE STOLEN MY HEART в™Є

13:20.100 --> 13:23.103
(falsetto voice) BOOP, BOOP,
BOOP, BOOP, BOOP, BOOP, BOOP.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.504
MORNING.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.137
(normal voice) I JUST SAID,
"I LOVE YOU" IN MORSE CODE.

13:27.137 --> 13:28.338
OH, GOD.

13:28.338 --> 13:31.041
(Ellie) JULES, WHY ISN'T
MY COFFEE MADE YET?!

13:31.041 --> 13:32.412
STAY UP HERE.

13:34.084 --> 13:36.947
MORNING.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.551
YOU TOTALLY HAD SEX
LAST NIGHT.

13:41.551 --> 13:43.153
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

13:43.153 --> 13:45.825
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.
I KNOW THESE THINGS,

13:45.825 --> 13:48.428
AND PLUS THERE'S
A CONDOM WRAPPER ON YOUR BACK.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.902
OH. WAS IT JUST THE ONE?
GOOD GOD, JULES!

13:51.902 --> 13:55.135
I HAD TO SEX AWAY HIS TEARS.
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

13:56.836 --> 14:00.410
(door opens)

14:00.410 --> 14:02.512
HEY, TRAVIS.

14:02.512 --> 14:05.015
JOSH, LET'S MAKE A REAL EFFORT
TO WEAR SHIRTS

14:05.015 --> 14:09.019
AROUND EACH OTHER, OKAY?
SURE. HEY, DO YOU THINK
YOUR MOM LIKES ME?

14:09.019 --> 14:11.481
JUST WOKE UP, DUDE.

14:11.481 --> 14:14.124
(door closes)
JOSH.

14:14.124 --> 14:16.486
I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU'RE BACK.

14:16.486 --> 14:18.889
THANK YOU, MRS. TORRES.

14:18.889 --> 14:20.160
MMM.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.432
MMM. DON'T FORGET. THE CONCERT
TONIGHT'S OUTDOORS...

14:22.432 --> 14:24.494
(singsongy)
SO WE CAN HAVE A PICNIC!

14:24.494 --> 14:26.496
(singsongy)
YOU BRING THE CHEESE, PLEASE,

14:26.496 --> 14:28.868
I'LL BRING THE NOSH, JOSH!
(door opens and closes)

14:28.868 --> 14:31.101
AND NOW I'M RHYMING.
I HATE MYSELF.

14:31.101 --> 14:33.573
MY GOD. WHEN DID I
START DATING HIM AGAIN?

14:33.573 --> 14:36.076
IT'S JUST LIKE SISTER KATHERINE
USED TO SAY--

14:36.076 --> 14:38.578
NEVER HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE
YOU DON'T LOVE.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.580
IT'S DIRTY, AND YOU WILL
BURN IN HELL.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.582
WHERE'S TRAVIS?
HE SHOULD BE HEARING THIS.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.585
RELAX, SWEETIE. DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY PEOPLE I'VE SLEPT WITH

14:45.585 --> 14:47.587
THAT I DIDN'T LOVE?
LIKE, 20.

14:47.587 --> 14:51.161
21 IF YOU COUNT
THE FIRST 6 YEARS WITH ANDY.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.193
(doorbell rings)

14:53.193 --> 14:56.326
CAN I PLEASE HAVE
MY GOLF CLUBS BACK?

14:56.326 --> 14:58.598
JUST PAY UP.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.530
YOU GIVE HIM HIS CLUBS BACK!

15:00.530 --> 15:03.603
ANDY, APOLOGIZE
AND GO HOME.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.535
RIGHT. SORRY, JULES.

15:05.535 --> 15:08.038
THEY'RE IN THE GARAGE,
AREN'T THEY?

15:08.038 --> 15:10.140
NOPE.

15:28.028 --> 15:33.033
OHH! WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

15:33.033 --> 15:36.636
OH, NUTS.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.169
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU GOT
STUCK WITH THE KIDDIE CLUBS.

15:39.169 --> 15:41.171
NOW WE CAN CALL
THAT BET OFF.

15:41.171 --> 15:43.173
WHOA. PUMP YOUR BRAKES,
NEGATIVE NANCY.

15:43.173 --> 15:46.176
I TOLD THE GUYS THAT
I'M GONNA PLAY WITH THESE,

15:46.176 --> 15:49.319
AND I DOUBLED THE BET.
THE PLAN IS FOOLPROOF.

15:49.319 --> 15:52.022
I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE
A FIRM GRASP

15:52.022 --> 15:55.585
OF WHAT THAT TERM MEANS.
HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

15:55.585 --> 15:58.228
ELLIE WOULDN'T LET ME PUT IT UP
IN OUR HOUSE.

15:58.228 --> 15:59.689
UNACCEPTABLE.

15:59.689 --> 16:03.163
IF PRETTY BOY DOESN'T WANT
TO PLAY, THEN PUT ME IN.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.536
UNFORTUNATELY, LITTLE BUDDY,
G-MAN'S GOT MORE GAME THAN YOU.

16:06.536 --> 16:09.169
AH, WHATEVER YOU SAY.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.171
HEY, HEY, HEY,
YOU'RE STILL MY CADDY.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.572
THE MAN BEHIND THE MAN.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.604
AND I'M BACK.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.606
DID YOU NAIL THIS IN?

16:16.606 --> 16:20.180
I-I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO STEAL IT.

16:21.611 --> 16:24.714
MAYBE I DON'T HAVE
TO BREAK UP WITH JOSH.

16:24.714 --> 16:26.756
I MEAN, HE BARELY SNORES,

16:26.756 --> 16:28.518
AND HE IS GOOD AT
STOMPING ON COCKROACHES.

16:28.518 --> 16:31.521
PLUS HE'S SO YOUNG. WHEN
I'M 100, HE'LL BE, LIKE, 40,

16:31.521 --> 16:34.464
AND THEN HE CAN JUST
CARRY ME AROUND AND STUFF.

16:34.464 --> 16:36.326
WHY ARE YOU SUCH A WUSS?

16:36.326 --> 16:39.629
I JUST AM, ELLIE.
I THINK IT'S ENDEARING.

16:39.629 --> 16:41.771
WHEN I NEED TO END IT
WITH A GUY,

16:41.771 --> 16:44.274
I JUST SLEEP WITH
HIS BEST FRIEND OR HIS BROTHER.

16:44.274 --> 16:46.236
BROTHERS ARE GOOD,
BECAUSE IF THE GUY WAS HOT,

16:46.236 --> 16:48.208
CHANCES ARE THE BROTHER
WILL BE HOT, TOO.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.580
BEST FRIENDS ARE A CRAPSHOOT.
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
HAVE A COMPETITION

16:50.580 --> 16:52.582
TO SEE WHO CAN BE LESS HELPFUL?
FINE.
IF YOU WANNA DO THIS RIGHT,

16:52.582 --> 16:55.085
YOU HAVE TO SMOTHER
ANY HOPE THE BOY HAS.

16:55.085 --> 16:58.088
IF YOU LEAVE A SINGLE PIECE
OF STRING FOR HIM TO HOLD ON TO,

16:58.088 --> 17:01.391
HE'S GONNA USE IT JUST TO CLIMB
RIGHT BACK INTO YOUR LIFE.

17:01.391 --> 17:04.224
YOU HAVE TO ASSASSINATE HIM.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.495
YES.

17:05.495 --> 17:09.099
OH, WHY CAN'T JOSH JUST BE
IN A COMA LIKE FRANCIS?

17:09.099 --> 17:12.132
I DON'T KNOW, SWEETIE.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.303
(whack)

17:13.303 --> 17:15.405
(crash, shatter in distance)
OHH! CHUNKED IT.

17:15.405 --> 17:17.537
AT LEAST
YOU DON'T LOOK STUPID.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.439
YOU KNOW,
MY STOMACH'S ACTING UP.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.742
IT'S ALL SQUIRRELLY,
LIKE I'M HUNGRY, BUT OPPOSITE.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.244
IT'S CALLED NERVES,
DIPSTICK,

17:24.244 --> 17:27.417
'CAUSE WE'RE ABOUT
TO LOSE 1,000 BUCKS.

17:27.417 --> 17:30.750
NOW LISTEN, I REALLY DON'T
THINK WE SHOULD DO THIS.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.483
I'M SO SORRY FOR PUTTING YOU
IN THIS POSITION, TRULY.

17:33.483 --> 17:36.386
BUT I NEED THIS CASH, BAD.

17:36.386 --> 17:37.557
YEAH?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.828
YEAH.

17:38.828 --> 17:41.761
(sighs) ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I GOT YOUR BACK.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.063
AND WE'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.366
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

17:46.366 --> 17:49.839
YOU LOSE YOUR BOAT, SO WHAT?
YOU CRASH AT A FRIEND'S PLACE.
YOU GOT A SPARE ROOM?

17:49.839 --> 17:52.842
NOT MY PLACE, BUT COME ON NOW.
LET'S SEE THIS! COME ON.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.246
(exhales deeply)

17:58.708 --> 18:00.210
(whack)

18:00.210 --> 18:03.213
OOH! BINGO!

18:03.213 --> 18:04.284
VERY NICE.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.486
OH, GOOD.
YOU GUYS ARE BONDING.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.487
(laughs)

18:07.487 --> 18:09.189
BACK OFF, MAN.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.122
I'M WARNING YOU.

18:14.464 --> 18:16.226
(hums)

18:16.226 --> 18:19.269
(doorbell rings)

18:19.269 --> 18:21.531
OH, HI, BOBBY.

18:21.531 --> 18:23.102
HEY, J-BIRD.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.675
THE COBBSTER JUST ROCKED IT
WITH SOME KIDDIE CLUBS,

18:25.675 --> 18:27.477
SO HERE'S YOUR MONEY.

18:27.477 --> 18:30.510
THANK YOU.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.711
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.743
JOSH IS ON HIS WAY OVER.

18:33.743 --> 18:37.116
HE TOLD ME HE LOVED ME,
SO I HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH HIM.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.448
I DO, RIGHT?

18:38.448 --> 18:41.191
YEAH, BUT SO WHAT?

18:41.191 --> 18:43.493
HE'S YOUNG, HANDSOME.

18:43.493 --> 18:45.195
HE'S GOT TALL HAIR.

18:45.195 --> 18:47.827
HE'LL GET OVER IT
IN, LIKE, A DAY.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.600
EXCUSE ME. DID YOU NOT SEE
THE OUTFIT?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.602
FINE. MAYBE A WEEK.

18:52.602 --> 18:53.803
BETTER ANSWER.

18:53.803 --> 18:56.236
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU AND I
WERE MARRIED,

18:56.236 --> 18:57.537
IT WASN'T PERFECT, BUT--

18:57.537 --> 18:59.169
SOMETIMES IT WAS PERFECT.

18:59.169 --> 19:02.242
BOBBY, JUST TAKE
WHAT I'M GIVING YOU.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.875
BUT STILL, I ALWAYS KNEW THAT
YOU COULD ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.877
BUT NOW IF I DATE SOMEONE,

19:07.877 --> 19:10.180
I HAVE THE CHANCE
OF REALLY HURTING THEM.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.681
IT'S JUST SO SCARY.

19:11.681 --> 19:14.424
(laughs)
THAT IS INCREDIBLY LAME.

19:14.424 --> 19:16.526
WHAT?

19:16.526 --> 19:19.229
YOU BEING AFRAID OF HURTING
SOME PRETTY KID'S FEELINGS.

19:19.229 --> 19:21.531
I MEAN, LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT SOME REAL FEAR.

19:21.531 --> 19:24.534
I'M HUSTLING MY ASS OFF JUST
TO KEEP A BOAT OVER MY HEAD,

19:24.534 --> 19:26.536
AND YOU--YOU'RE SMART.
YOU'RE TOUGH.

19:26.536 --> 19:29.299
YOU STARTED YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE FINE.

19:29.299 --> 19:31.901
WHAT AM I GONNA BE DOING
30 YEARS FROM NOW?

19:31.901 --> 19:34.904
TEACHING A COUPLE GOLF LESSONS
AND TRYING TO SCAM ENOUGH MONEY

19:34.904 --> 19:36.906
SO I CAN BUY A SIX-PACK

19:36.906 --> 19:39.779
OF WHATEVER SPACE-BEER
PEOPLE ARE DRINKING?

19:39.779 --> 19:41.351
THAT'S FEAR.

19:41.351 --> 19:44.354
DID THAT SOUND PISSY? 'CAUSE
I WANTED IT TO SOUND PISSY.

19:44.354 --> 19:47.257
BOBBY,
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

19:47.257 --> 19:49.219
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

19:49.219 --> 19:50.590
MM-HMM.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.863
BECAUSE IF YOU SAY IT, JULES,
I MIGHT ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT.

19:53.863 --> 19:56.266
I REALLY THINK SO.

19:56.266 --> 19:58.268
THANK YOU.

19:58.268 --> 20:01.631
ANYTIME.

20:01.631 --> 20:05.605
в™Єв™Є

20:07.977 --> 20:09.939
(snaps fingers)
CATCH YOU LATER, GATOR.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.515
HEY, BABE.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.717
DON'T LOVE YOU. NEVER WILL.
TOUGH COOKIES! BYE, JOSH.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.718
BUT--

20:18.718 --> 20:20.990
(exhales deeply) AHH.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.422
NO.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.424
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

20:24.424 --> 20:27.427
I DON'T KNOW, ABOUT HALFWAY
THROUGH YOUR EX'S SOB STORY.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.859
BOO-HOO! I'M GETTING WINE.

20:29.859 --> 20:32.332
ME, TOO.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.963
THANK YOU.

20:33.963 --> 20:35.665
MMM.

20:35.665 --> 20:39.339
SO YOUR SECOND-FIRST BREAKUP.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

20:39.339 --> 20:42.011
A LITTLE GASSY.
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:42.011 --> 20:45.244
THE LAST THING YOU WANNA DO
IS KEEP THAT DOOR OPEN.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.418
IF YOU GIVE A GUY
ANY STRINGS TO HOLD ON TO,

20:48.418 --> 20:51.421
YOU JUST KNOW
HE'LL CLING TO THEM FOREVER.

20:51.421 --> 20:54.784
(man)
в™Є THE DEFEATS OF YESTERDAY в™Є

20:58.588 --> 20:59.989
(exhales deeply)

21:06.796 --> 21:10.700
(voice breaking)
SHE WAS SO COOL.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.572
AND NOW SHE'S GONE.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.904
YES,
SHE'S A VERY MEAN LADY.

21:14.904 --> 21:16.446
(sniffles)

21:16.446 --> 21:18.448
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

21:18.448 --> 21:22.912
OH! SUCH PRETTY TEARS
FROM SUCH A BEAUTIFUL BOY.

21:22.912 --> 21:26.416
(laughs)
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.287
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

21:28.287 --> 21:29.759
KINDA NICE.

21:29.759 --> 21:31.791
HOW ABOUT THAT?

21:31.791 --> 21:34.424
(moans) YEAH.

21:34.424 --> 21:36.826
BARB'S GONNA TAKE
GOOD CARE OF YOU.
