12:32.987 --> 12:34.154

12:37.924 --> 12:39.393
Who's out there?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.495

-Ty!

(male groans)

12:59.846 --> 13:01.448

13:03.117 --> 13:04.985
What was that thing?

13:05.019 --> 13:07.154
Evidently,
an indigenous life-form.

You got to get cultured,

Barry Manilow was
an underappreciated genius

for Dr. Finn,

15:26.092 --> 15:30.164

15:34.434 --> 15:36.570
You know,

15:36.603 --> 15:38.638
in astrogeology class
I learned that

15:38.672 --> 15:40.840
there's lots of dysonium
in the galaxy.

Like, on lots
of different planets.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.311
Maybe there's some here.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.346
Without the shuttle's scanners,

15:46.380 --> 15:48.915
I am unable to search
beyond the immediate vicinity.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.951
Well... maybe just try?

15:54.821 --> 15:57.123

-I am detecting trace amounts

15:57.157 --> 15:59.125
of dysonium on the outer-hull.

the presence of a deposit

16:01.561 --> 16:03.463
in the mountains
where the shuttle impacted.

16:03.497 --> 16:05.665
-So there is dysonium?
-Indeed.

are some distance away,

16:13.307 --> 16:15.275

16:15.309 --> 16:18.378

We will depart in the morning.

there's more monsters?

16:20.680 --> 16:24.218

-That's not true! -You
continuously disrespect her,

19:05.512 --> 19:07.313

19:51.024 --> 19:53.527
Are they... dead?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.562
No, they are merely stunned.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.898
They appear to be suffering
from disease and malnutrition.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.199
Why did they want us?

20:00.233 --> 20:01.668
I would surmise

20:01.701 --> 20:05.371
that their intent was
to consume you.

20:05.405 --> 20:09.876
My hand must remain unencumbered
in the event I require its use.

My name is Drogen.

21:10.637 --> 21:14.407
You are very lucky I found you.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.442

21:16.476 --> 21:19.278
my two sons
and an artificial being.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.615
You were the only one
I found in the wreckage.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.182

21:23.216 --> 21:25.418
why I need to find them.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.321
They're young,
they could be hurt.

21:28.354 --> 21:30.757
No one survives
out there for long.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.127
I was carrying
a communication device.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.495

-Let me call my kids!
-It won't matter.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.539
-Why?
-There was a war.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.975
The enemy put Paloxus
in the water supply.

21:49.008 --> 21:52.045
-Paloxus?
-A biological weapon.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.713
Millions were killed.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.949
A few survived,
but they are sick,

21:55.982 --> 21:58.718
desperate, violent.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.154
Many have resorted
to cannibalism

22:01.187 --> 22:03.623
because the food is almost gone.

22:03.657 --> 22:06.626
You don't look sick.

22:06.660 --> 22:10.564
I was one of the few
who saw the danger coming.

22:10.597 --> 22:13.800
And I stored enough food
and clean water,

22:13.833 --> 22:18.304
enough to last
for a long, long time,

22:18.337 --> 22:22.876
and... I have weapons.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.579
Look, I'm a doctor.

22:25.612 --> 22:29.015
Let me go, and maybe
I can find a cure.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.050
There is no cure.

22:31.084 --> 22:33.953
I'm your only hope
for survival.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.305
If you are undamaged,
then we must keep moving.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.575
Come on.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.991
The shuttle's ion trail ends
directly ahead.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.493
Bortus, any sign
of the shuttle itself?

23:47.526 --> 23:50.096
Negative, Commander,
but I am detecting

23:50.129 --> 23:51.731

23:51.765 --> 23:53.199
Let's see it.

23:56.803 --> 24:00.907
-What is that? -It appears to be
a class-two spatial fold.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.142
Back at Union Point,
we called that a glory hole.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.778
You called it a glory hole.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.412
Nobody else called it
a glory hole.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.613
ALARA:
Captain, their ion trail

24:07.647 --> 24:09.148
leads directly through it.

24:09.182 --> 24:10.950
Well, if we're gonna find them,

24:10.984 --> 24:12.485
we got to follow them.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.020
We have no idea
where that thing leads.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.656
We could end up inside of
a planet, or a star.

24:16.690 --> 24:19.458
Most of space is empty,
so our odds are good.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.194
We're gonna have to chance it.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.462
Gordon, take us in.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.531
Aye, sir.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.466
♪

24:31.504 --> 24:33.439
Now entering glory hole.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.842
-No, Bortus, it's not-- it's...
-Sir?

24:35.875 --> 24:36.575
It's fine, forget it.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.480

24:59.665 --> 25:02.201

soy sauce on his pants.

25:02.235 --> 25:04.070
He put that in a damage report?

25:04.103 --> 25:05.671
Yes.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.406

better people.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.908
Lieutenant, where are we?

25:08.942 --> 25:10.676
I don't recognize anything.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.345
There's a good chance
we're off the charts here.

25:12.378 --> 25:13.847

25:13.880 --> 25:15.849
No response.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.751
I'm not picking up
a distress signal, either.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.552
BORTUS: Sir, we have to assume
the shuttle suffered

25:19.585 --> 25:21.320
worse damage than we did.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.621
Maybe they decided
to set down somewhere.

25:24.457 --> 25:26.525
What's the nearest star system?

25:26.559 --> 25:28.261
One Gas Giant with 72 moons.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.764
36 of them are large enough
to support atmospheres.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.498

to search all that?

consumed your ration bar.

26:00.927 --> 26:04.097
When we were leaving...

26:04.130 --> 26:06.565
I told my mom she sucked.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.868
That was one of the last things
I said to her.

26:08.902 --> 26:11.437
It is quite possible
your mother is alive.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.973
-What makes you say that?
-There was no sign of blood

26:14.007 --> 26:15.241
or severed limbs in the shuttle.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.946
I will replenish the fire.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.551
Must be nice not feeling pain.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.553
We have a long journey tomorrow.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.588

stories before we went to sleep.

and her two children.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.145
They embarked on a recreational
journey to a leisure planet.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.247
Their shuttle was diverted
by a spatial anomaly

26:54.280 --> 26:56.015
and crashed into a mountain.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.583
The children survived
with the help

26:57.616 --> 26:59.986
of a more advanced
artificial life-form.

27:00.019 --> 27:03.022

or dead. The end.

And he'll probably have
nightmares for a while.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.802
-But he's okay?
-Yeah.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.837
Well, notify us when you have
a full stock of the cure.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.139
I want to get clearance from the
admiralty to send a medical team

41:14.172 --> 41:15.640
back to that moon.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.375
Maybe we can help
those poor people.

41:17.409 --> 41:18.877
-If they'll let us.
-You know,

41:18.911 --> 41:21.847
Isaac briefed me on everything
that happened down there.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.482
But what I'm still missing
is your end of the report.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.685
Can it wait, Captain?

41:26.719 --> 41:29.822
There's something
I need to do first.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.661
(indistinct chatter)

41:40.665 --> 41:42.167
Isaac.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.803
Good morning, Doctor.

41:44.837 --> 41:48.006
I thought you'd like to know,
Ty's gonna make a full recovery.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.975
I am pleased to hear it.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.744
He's been asking about you.

41:51.777 --> 41:53.979
You think you could drop
by sickbay later?

41:54.012 --> 41:55.647
For what reason?

41:55.680 --> 41:56.849
He misses you.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.817
Odd.

41:58.851 --> 42:02.020
Very well.
I will visit him this evening.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.696
Isaac...

42:13.398 --> 42:15.100
...I wanted to thank you

42:15.133 --> 42:17.335
for taking such good care
of my kids.

42:17.369 --> 42:20.038
They're everything to me.

42:20.072 --> 42:22.941
I thank you for the opportunity
to observe them.

42:22.975 --> 42:24.943
It was quite informative.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.879
The boys adore you.

42:26.912 --> 42:29.882
I don't know why or how you
managed to keep them in line,

42:29.915 --> 42:33.118
but... I'm sure as hell glad
you did.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.687
I simply adjusted my programming
to accommodate

42:35.720 --> 42:39.257
their sibling dynamics
and emotional responses.

42:39.291 --> 42:40.725
Your failed attempts
at discipline

42:40.759 --> 42:42.895
were also instructive.

42:42.928 --> 42:45.030
Well, anyway,

42:45.063 --> 42:46.932
I'll leave you alone.

42:46.965 --> 42:50.402
May I make a final observation?

42:50.435 --> 42:53.471
Your children are unruly,
disrespectful,

42:53.505 --> 42:56.241
volatile,
and highly unpredictable.

42:56.274 --> 42:58.944
I am quite fond of them.

42:58.977 --> 43:02.014
Welcome to the family.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.238
