10:24.758 --> 10:26.379
I know I wasn't
supposed to do it.

10:26.379 --> 10:28.310
I know they're dirty.

10:28.310 --> 10:30.482
I tried to think
about other things,

10:30.482 --> 10:33.620
but I couldn't get those
pictures out of my head.

10:33.620 --> 10:36.241
Stupid sexy Harriet Tubman.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.379
Okay, let's get
one thing clear, Dean.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.310
The feelings that you have
when you see those magazines

10:44.310 --> 10:46.241
are natural.

10:46.241 --> 10:47.965
They are not dirty.

10:47.965 --> 10:50.310
I don't want you
to ever feel guilty

10:50.310 --> 10:54.000
or ashamed of
what you're feeling.

10:55.724 --> 10:59.000
So, I think it's time that
we talk with you about sex.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.689
<i>Maybe it was time
for me to die.</i>

11:00.689 --> 11:02.482
Can't we just whoop the boy
like God intended?

11:02.482 --> 11:04.344
Yeah, Mama,
I'll take the whooping.

11:04.344 --> 11:06.689
I'd rather
us talk about it.

11:06.689 --> 11:08.517
Why do you always
wanna talk?

11:08.517 --> 11:11.137
Women don't know anything
about this stuff.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.344
What stuff?

11:12.344 --> 11:15.206
Nudie magazines
and stuff.

11:18.241 --> 11:21.137
Those magazines
aren't your father's.

11:21.137 --> 11:23.034
They're mine.

11:24.827 --> 11:28.413
<i>At that moment, it felt like
time almost stood still.</i>

11:37.241 --> 11:39.965
Why would you want to look at
magazines like those?

11:39.965 --> 11:41.413
You remember when
your father would be

11:41.413 --> 11:43.413
on the road with the band
a lot?

11:43.413 --> 11:45.413
Well, I would miss him.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.793
Are there pictures of him
in those magazines?

11:48.793 --> 11:50.965
No.
Not exactly.

11:50.965 --> 11:53.586
But there are
pictures of couples.

11:53.586 --> 11:56.586
And some of the men would
remind me of your dad.

11:56.586 --> 11:58.655
We even used to
look at them together.

11:58.655 --> 12:00.965
So, you don't anymore?

12:00.965 --> 12:03.448
I guess we haven't
in a while.

12:03.448 --> 12:05.137
Why'd you stop?

12:05.137 --> 12:07.862
Well -- Well, you all
were getting older

12:07.862 --> 12:09.827
and we both were
pretty busy with work.

12:09.827 --> 12:13.586
Yeah, you know,
with teaching and tenure.

12:13.586 --> 12:17.827
And I was going up for that
new promotion, more hours...

12:17.827 --> 12:21.379
So, all that makes you not
miss each other anymore?

12:24.896 --> 12:26.413
That's not important.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.758
I just want you to
understand

12:27.758 --> 12:29.655
that this is all normal
and healthy.

12:29.655 --> 12:32.275
For men and women.

12:32.275 --> 12:34.448
O-Okay.

12:34.448 --> 12:35.793
Good.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.344
Any more questions?

12:37.344 --> 12:39.172
Great. Now that that's done,
who wants dinner?

12:39.172 --> 12:41.172
Well, since you asked,

12:41.172 --> 12:44.793
I <i>did</i> overhear some older kids
talking the other day.

12:46.448 --> 12:47.965
What's a period?

12:47.965 --> 12:49.724
Damn it, Lillian!

12:49.724 --> 12:51.758
Okay. A period...

12:51.758 --> 12:54.689
<i>In the '60s, most women
didn't openly talk about sex,</i>

12:54.689 --> 12:57.034
<i>but Mama was always
ahead of the curve.</i>

12:57.034 --> 12:59.000
<i>She was the first Black woman
in her hometown</i>

12:59.000 --> 13:00.655
<i>to learn how to drive.</i>

13:00.655 --> 13:02.068
<i>She was the first Black woman
in her hometown</i>

13:02.068 --> 13:03.896
<i>to go to college.</i>

13:03.896 --> 13:05.758
<i>And I can't prove this one,
but I'm fairly certain</i>

13:05.758 --> 13:07.758
<i>she was the first Black woman
in the neighborhood</i>

13:07.758 --> 13:10.724
<i>to own a cardboard box
chock-full of porn.</i>

13:12.655 --> 13:15.862
One day, there is going to be
a woman that you love,

13:15.862 --> 13:18.137
and knowing this
about the opposite sex

13:18.137 --> 13:22.827
is gonna make you a more open
and caring partner.

13:22.827 --> 13:25.689
Most men have no idea
about the female sex drive,

13:25.689 --> 13:27.517
and I don't want you
to turn out like them.

13:27.517 --> 13:29.241
True.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.655
Wait, in this scenario,

13:30.655 --> 13:32.827
is Dean most men,
or am I?

13:32.827 --> 13:34.413
All I'm saying is
I know this isn't

13:34.413 --> 13:36.000
what you were expecting to hear
from a woman,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.655
especially your mom,

13:37.655 --> 13:39.827
but I don't think
it's too much for me to ask

13:39.827 --> 13:44.655
that my son grow up to be
a caring and tender man.

13:48.655 --> 13:50.310
I'll be taking these.

13:50.310 --> 13:52.620
Aren't you forgetting the
"just like his father" part?

13:52.620 --> 13:54.793
"Just like your father."

13:54.793 --> 13:56.827
It was implied.

14:06.724 --> 14:08.827
Mom and Dad gave you the talk,
didn't they?

14:08.827 --> 14:10.344
What talk?

14:10.344 --> 14:13.413
The "Let's ruin the fun of
thinking about sex" talk.

14:13.413 --> 14:15.827
Yeah,
it was pretty weird.

14:15.827 --> 14:18.241
Yeah, they gave me the same one
a few years ago.

14:18.241 --> 14:22.482
Yeah.
Mama said that the dirty ma--

14:22.482 --> 14:26.724
I mean "adult" magazines
I found were hers.

14:26.724 --> 14:28.965
Wait,
Mom has nudie magazines?

14:28.965 --> 14:31.000
The same mom that made me
get baptized again

14:31.000 --> 14:32.413
for wearing a bikini?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.379
<i>Oh, she got baptized again,
alright,</i>

14:34.379 --> 14:36.689
<i>but trust me, it wasn't just
about the bikini.</i>

14:36.689 --> 14:38.517
What else
did they tell you?

14:38.517 --> 14:40.827
That the baby
comes out the --

14:40.827 --> 14:42.000
Ugh. Yeah.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.551
Ouch.

14:43.551 --> 14:45.551
And that if you don't use
birth control, you get a --

14:45.551 --> 14:49.241
Bruce.

14:49.241 --> 14:51.689
But did Dad warn you
that not even the pill

14:51.689 --> 14:53.172
will keep a girl from
getting pregnant

14:53.172 --> 14:55.206
if she has sex before
she graduates college?

14:55.206 --> 14:57.137
No.

14:57.137 --> 14:58.344
Of course he didn't.

14:58.344 --> 15:00.068
He saved the lies for me.

15:00.068 --> 15:02.206
Ugh. Dad!

15:02.206 --> 15:05.689
<i>I had been equipped with
knowledge much beyond my years.</i>

15:05.689 --> 15:09.000
<i>And with great knowledge comes
great responsibility.</i>

15:09.000 --> 15:12.172
<i>Responsibility to show
my friends how much I knew.</i>

15:12.172 --> 15:15.000
Wait, so when are we gonna
get our periods?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.517
No, you idiot.
It's for girls.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.793
How did you
find all this out?

15:18.793 --> 15:20.172
My mom told me.

15:20.172 --> 15:22.137
You talk about this
with your mom?

15:22.137 --> 15:24.034
Yep. She said that
girls like guys

15:24.034 --> 15:25.758
who know this kind of stuff,

15:25.758 --> 15:27.965
and she wants to make sure
I'm a good husband one day.

15:27.965 --> 15:29.689
I bet you guys
didn't even know

15:29.689 --> 15:31.655
girls look at
these magazines, too.

15:31.655 --> 15:34.241
No way!
Oh, yeah.
It's true.

15:34.241 --> 15:36.517
Women look at them because it
reminds them of their husbands.

15:36.517 --> 15:39.000
Ohhhh.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.724
<i>Now that I had
clearly surpassed</i>

15:40.724 --> 15:42.310
<i>the studly-ness of the guys,</i>

15:42.310 --> 15:43.931
<i>I thought I'd take
what I learned from Mama</i>

15:43.931 --> 15:46.206
<i>and use it to help me
get closer to Keisa.</i>

15:46.206 --> 15:48.586
<i>She was about to see
just how knowledgeable I was</i>

15:48.586 --> 15:51.000
<i>about women and their urges.</i>

15:51.000 --> 15:53.344
Hey, Keisa,

15:53.344 --> 15:56.241
you're never gonna believe
what I just found out.

15:56.241 --> 15:58.000
<i>What I didn't
expect to find out</i>

15:58.000 --> 16:00.137
<i>was how hard
Keisa's right cross was.</i>

16:02.206 --> 16:05.172
Dean, what happened?

16:05.172 --> 16:08.448
All I did was tell everybody
the stuff you told me.

16:11.517 --> 16:13.344
Mrs. Williams.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.172
So, as I told you each
on the phone,

16:24.172 --> 16:26.000
we caught Dean sharing

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
an awful lot of detailed
personals with Keisa.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.413
Well, I just want to say

16:31.413 --> 16:33.586
how embarrassed we are
at Dean's actions.

16:33.586 --> 16:36.000
Well, unfortunately,
that doesn't change the fact

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
that my little girl was forced
to listen to that smut.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.758
Where did he even
hear this filth?

16:41.758 --> 16:44.862
Who knows? Boys will be boys.

16:44.862 --> 16:47.310
He claimed
he heard it from you.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.517
Thank you.

16:48.517 --> 16:50.482
How are you
raising your children?

16:50.482 --> 16:53.689
Now because of you, not only was
my daughter exposed to...

16:53.689 --> 16:56.068
Ears!

16:56.068 --> 16:58.379
...sex,

16:58.379 --> 17:00.758
now my wife has
to sit here and hear about it.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.172
There's no telling
what perverse thoughts

17:02.172 --> 17:04.344
this puts in Keisa's mind.

17:04.344 --> 17:06.241
She could be
scarred for life,

17:06.241 --> 17:09.137
all because your little boy
want to sit and expose her

17:09.137 --> 17:10.551
to things he saw in...

17:10.551 --> 17:13.827
Ears!

17:13.827 --> 17:16.551
...
pornographies.

17:16.551 --> 17:19.379
<i>All I wanted was for my mom
to set this guy straight.</i>

17:19.379 --> 17:21.068
<i>I wanted her to explain to him</i>

17:21.068 --> 17:22.689
<i>the same thing
she explained to me --</i>

17:22.689 --> 17:24.965
<i>that it's not dirty,
it's all normal.</i>

17:24.965 --> 17:27.482
<i>Well, some of the ratios
of the women</i>

17:27.482 --> 17:30.000
<i>in the middle pages
may not have been normal.</i>

17:30.000 --> 17:33.827
I'm sorry you have to sit here
and hear all this...talk.

17:33.827 --> 17:35.655
<i>Get him, Mama.</i>

17:35.655 --> 17:37.620
<i>Tell him how women like
this stuff, too.</i>

17:37.620 --> 17:40.413
I'm so,
so sorry, too.

17:40.413 --> 17:42.655
<i>But when Mama didn't
put him in his place,</i>

17:42.655 --> 17:44.827
<i>I began to understand why.</i>

17:44.827 --> 17:46.586
<i>Keisa's dad was an example</i>

17:46.586 --> 17:49.655
<i>of the type of man
my mama didn't want me to be.</i>

17:49.655 --> 17:52.206
<i>As awful as I thought
my family's talk was,</i>

17:52.206 --> 17:54.310
<i>I realized
it wasn't nearly as bad</i>

17:54.310 --> 17:56.862
<i>as the talk Keisa's family
wasn't having.</i>

17:56.862 --> 17:59.206
<i>And in that moment,
I was so proud</i>

17:59.206 --> 18:01.206
<i>to have a membership card
in Mama's club.</i>

18:01.206 --> 18:02.758
How 'bout
I take Dean home

18:02.758 --> 18:06.068
and give him a good,
long talking to.

18:06.068 --> 18:08.551
Maybe let your husband
handle it.

18:08.551 --> 18:10.379
Thank you
for the advice.

18:19.931 --> 18:22.620
Now, there's no need to tell
your father about all this.

18:24.241 --> 18:25.413
Really?

18:25.413 --> 18:27.206
<i>Even sexually liberated women</i>

18:27.206 --> 18:29.379
<i>hate hearing their husbands
say, "I told you so."</i>

18:33.551 --> 18:36.379
<i>As good as it felt for my
friends to think I was mature,</i>

18:36.379 --> 18:39.172
<i>it felt even better for my
parents to treat me that way.</i>

18:40.689 --> 18:42.689
Don't you touch that radio, boy.
You ain't grown.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.482
Yes, ma'am.

18:44.482 --> 18:46.310
<i>And I'm dedicated
to my profession</i>

18:46.310 --> 18:48.517
<i>and skilled in it,
and what's more,</i>

18:48.517 --> 18:50.655
<i>I can handle even
the most exacting demands</i>

18:50.655 --> 18:52.034
<i>of a mean, gruff...</i>

18:52.034 --> 18:53.793
<i>...old man with
the heartwarming manners</i>

18:53.793 --> 18:55.689
<i>of a wounded moose.</i>

19:03.172 --> 19:04.862
<i>Oh, no.</i>

19:04.862 --> 19:07.413
<i>I caught my parents
looking at porn.</i>

19:07.413 --> 19:10.379
<i>If this was the Old Testament,
we'd all be stoned.</i>

19:10.379 --> 19:12.068
Dean?

19:12.068 --> 19:13.241
What are you doing?

19:13.241 --> 19:14.724
Uh...

19:14.724 --> 19:16.896
just staying out of
grown folks' business.

19:16.896 --> 19:18.517
Well, come on down here
and look at

19:18.517 --> 19:20.586
how handsome your father looked
on our wedding day.

19:20.586 --> 19:22.793
I better have.
That suit cost half a Buick.

19:24.344 --> 19:25.793
Oh, wow.

19:25.793 --> 19:27.137
Oh, look at the time.

19:27.137 --> 19:29.896
People must
already be here.

19:32.068 --> 19:34.413
Girl, when's the last time
you had one of these?

19:34.413 --> 19:35.862
It's been a while,
for sure.

19:35.862 --> 19:37.206
Mm.

19:37.206 --> 19:38.689
Oh, watch it now.

19:38.689 --> 19:40.758
Hey, hey, don't mess around

19:40.758 --> 19:42.137
