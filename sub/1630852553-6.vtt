03:47.836 --> 03:50.491
weakened by the X-Kryptonite.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.797
And now,
I'm stuck once again...

03:52.841 --> 03:55.496
because of you.
- Not because of me.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.368
Because you killed
innocent people--two teenagers.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.762
- Only by necessity.
- You almost killed my friend.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.590
- He attacked me.
- You tried to kill me!

04:02.633 --> 04:04.722

those visions to stop!

This will solve nothing.

04:10.554 --> 04:13.775
The pendant you came here with,
what is it, exactly?

04:13.818 --> 04:15.690
It's an artifact
as old as time,

04:15.733 --> 04:17.431
born when our worlds split.

04:17.474 --> 04:18.997
Paired with its counterpart,

04:19.041 --> 04:21.304
it can elevate the possessor
into godhood.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.349
I don't understand.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.307
You came here to this Earth

04:24.351 --> 04:25.439
to destroy it?

04:25.482 --> 04:26.614
To ensure I wasn't stopped.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.355
- By whom?
- Let's just say

04:28.398 --> 04:30.661
I'm not as revered on my world
as you are here, Kal.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.924
But none of that's
of any concern to you.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.100
All that matters
is the pendant is destroyed.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.320
- Why didn't you?
- I was not able to.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
I don't possess enough strength
on this earth.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.890
The yellow sun weakens me.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.153
Perhaps with you,
it could be done.

04:44.196 --> 04:47.243
Perhaps, but there is
a more certain way to end this.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.636
Kill Ally.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.160
- I'm not killing anyone.
- Then you have no choice.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.597
Find the pendant,
and see it destroyed.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.947
It's the only way to make sure
she can't use it

04:55.991 --> 04:57.471
to merge with her other self.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.343
And if she does...merge?

05:00.387 --> 05:02.389
What would happen?

05:02.432 --> 05:05.305
She would inherit
enough power

05:28.023 --> 05:30.504
Everything about this me
is bizarre.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.114
Huh?

05:32.157 --> 05:33.724
Bizarre.
- Oh.

Well, maybe
there's another reason

05:34.943 --> 05:36.379
he wants the pendant destroyed.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.076
Maybe.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.427
But it seems consistent

05:40.470 --> 05:42.211
fixing what's wrong,
becoming whole.

Was there anything in your

05:46.302 --> 05:47.956

- No, but Chrissy and I

05:47.999 --> 05:49.697
need to do a deeper dive
to see if we can find

05:49.740 --> 05:52.352
something that will help us
understand what she saw

05:52.395 --> 05:53.396
when she crossed over.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.571
Clark, if he is right,

is to use these pendants

05:56.617 --> 05:57.922
to become some kind of a god...

05:57.966 --> 05:59.359
Then I need to get it back
from Anderson

05:59.402 --> 06:00.838

<i>And we don't know where</i> <i>
this other Superman has gone?</i>

06:03.972 --> 06:06.627
This is the last

06:06.670 --> 06:07.628
That's enough.

06:07.671 --> 06:08.629
And our Superman?

06:08.672 --> 06:09.891

for him as well.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.720
But not confirmation.

06:12.763 --> 06:15.200
He's still hesitant
to share information with me.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.333
I'm beginning
to understand why.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.987
- Ma'am--
- Over 20 years,

06:19.030 --> 06:21.729
Sam Lane never had
a single problem with Superman.

06:21.772 --> 06:24.558
Not one. You've been here
for six months,

06:24.601 --> 06:25.776
and in that time,
our relationship

06:25.820 --> 06:27.691
with this country's
best defense system

06:27.735 --> 06:29.780
has deteriorated significantly.

06:29.824 --> 06:33.001
X-Kryptonite has made its way
into the public domain,

06:33.044 --> 06:35.525
and an unidentified
Kryptonian being

06:35.569 --> 06:37.266
took the lives
of two of our assets.

06:37.309 --> 06:38.833
Sending
the Supermen of America

06:38.876 --> 06:40.443
in to fight that thing
was a miscalculation.

06:40.487 --> 06:43.968
Two soldiers died.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.536
It was a hell of a lot more
than a miscalculation.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.538
Today you will represent

06:48.582 --> 06:50.061
the Threat Reduction Agency

06:50.105 --> 06:53.500
at the funerals
of the fallen SOA members.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.327
Then you will return here,

06:55.371 --> 06:58.330
and you will find
that pale son of a bitch

06:58.374 --> 07:00.202
by any means necessary,

07:00.245 --> 07:03.466

of your duties.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.554

Mm...why?

- Yeah.

how to walk along the walls

wouldn't creak...

28:18.044 --> 28:20.786

28:52.861 --> 28:55.908
I was stupid and naive.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.736

Yeah.

Did he love you?

29:03.654 --> 29:04.786

Kyle's a good guy.

30:48.847 --> 30:49.935
Lucy...

30:49.978 --> 30:51.588
I know it was crazy
at first.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.373
But after everything
that has happened,

30:53.416 --> 30:55.592
you have to agree
that Ally was right.

30:55.636 --> 30:59.640
There is an inverse to us all
just waiting to make us whole.

30:59.683 --> 31:04.036

a lot of unanswered questions.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.167

do you need to know?

31:05.211 --> 31:06.865
Even your partner confirmed it.

31:06.908 --> 31:09.258
After she was drugged
against her will.

31:09.302 --> 31:11.347
Doesn't that kind
of behavior concern you?

31:11.391 --> 31:14.133

people the truth.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.525

31:15.569 --> 31:18.354
That is textbook
extremist behavior.

31:18.398 --> 31:19.921
What else is she capable of?

31:19.965 --> 31:22.315
Ally's reputation
was dragged through the mud.

31:22.358 --> 31:23.882
What other choice
does she have?

31:23.925 --> 31:26.014
I'm guessing anything
not involving

31:26.058 --> 31:27.624
drugging or blackmail.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.800
That is so unfair
coming from you.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.586
Lucy, I love you, but you
have always been attracted

31:32.629 --> 31:35.415
to the kind of person
who promises to fix everything.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.460
Oh, so now this is my fault?

31:37.504 --> 31:39.027
I'm just saying
there's a pattern here.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.811
First, it was Ally's beliefs.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.030
Then, it was her behavior.

31:42.074 --> 31:44.293
Now apparently,
I am too weak and damaged

31:44.337 --> 31:46.600
to know any better.
- I did not say that.

you broke it off

37:44.349 --> 37:45.785

37:45.828 --> 37:49.354
That's--I mean,
that's right.

The problem is,
I can't help but wonder,

37:54.272 --> 37:57.449
would you have broken it off
to save your marriage?

37:57.492 --> 38:00.713
Lana, yes, of course.

Come on, I wasn't myself
back then.

38:03.585 --> 38:06.501

20 years ago.

That hasn't changed.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.392
Maybe not for you.

38:29.524 --> 38:33.528
Lana, what are you saying?

38:35.617 --> 38:39.055
That you don't love me anymore?

38:39.099 --> 38:42.276
I'm not sure.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.061
And until I am,

38:45.105 --> 38:47.542
I think that you need
to move out.

38:47.586 --> 38:48.761
No, Lana, please--

38:48.804 --> 38:50.197
You can pick up your stuff
in the morning

38:50.240 --> 38:51.503

If I'd been more attentive

she never would've sought out
somebody like Ally Allston.

I don't think
that's something

39:48.864 --> 39:50.300
you can really control.

It sure feels like it.

39:52.259 --> 39:53.434
I hate to break it to you,

never gets easier.
