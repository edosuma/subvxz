00:01.126 --> 00:02.794
Previously on Prison Break:

00:10.802 --> 00:12.345
Michael!

00:14.264 --> 00:16.016
Scylla is complete.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.309
What the hell are
you doing?!

00:18.393 --> 00:19.853
The buyer is already on the way.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.606
Yeah, I got one.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.816
It's Bagwell.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.902
There is no meeting with
the attorney general, is there?

00:27.986 --> 00:29.279
He's sick, Lincoln.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.156
If they haven't killed
him already...

00:31.239 --> 00:32.532
We'll get him back, I promise.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.243
Michael needs an operation
to remove a tumor

00:35.326 --> 00:36.911
from his temporal lobe.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.581
The price of the operation
is the safe return of Scylla.

00:39.664 --> 00:40.707
What's this?

00:40.790 --> 00:42.625
Added incentive.

00:49.049 --> 00:49.924
What's going on?

00:50.008 --> 00:51.092
Where's Michael?

00:51.176 --> 00:53.261
Michael needs surgery;
he's gonna get it.

00:53.678 --> 00:54.721
Where?

00:54.804 --> 00:57.140
-Here.
-What?

00:57.974 --> 01:00.060
Krantz has arranged for the best
doctors in the world.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.478
We can't let them near him.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.021
We're out of time.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.355
It's our last option.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.567
I don't understand why
the Company would help him.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.778
Dr. Tancredi, welcome.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.863
Please...

01:12.655 --> 01:14.491
there's nothing to be afraid of.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.242
All we want is to help.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.535
You're going to save Michael?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.412
You question our capabilities?

01:19.496 --> 01:21.372
No. I'm questioning
your motives.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.167
When a fellow human being
is suffering,

01:24.501 --> 01:26.920
why would we not want
to lend a hand?

01:27.295 --> 01:28.755
Empathy, Sara,

01:29.089 --> 01:32.092
it's the only thing that
separates us from the beasts.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.968
For the duration
of the surgery,

01:34.427 --> 01:37.097
you'll be treated
as a guest in my home.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.474
And afterwards?

01:39.891 --> 01:42.519
Sir...
the patient is ready.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.022
It's going to be
all right, Sara.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.233
Trust me.

01:56.574 --> 02:00.078
Mr. Scofield, although you're
going to be anesthetized

02:00.161 --> 02:03.790
and should feel no significant
pain, we will need to keep

02:03.873 --> 02:06.209
you awake for the duration
of the procedure.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.962
As a safety precaution, we'll
need to continually monitor

02:09.045 --> 02:12.924
your speech and sensory activity
to insure the tissue

02:13.007 --> 02:16.845
being removed will not leave you
impaired in any way.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.763
What hospital is this?

02:19.097 --> 02:21.307
Don't worry about it.
You've got some good doctors

02:21.391 --> 02:23.434
who are going to take
great care of you.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.021
I have to get Scylla.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.690
No, no, no, no.

02:28.773 --> 02:29.858
Not now.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.985
Where's Linc?

02:32.777 --> 02:33.736
He's here.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.405
He's just fine.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.908
I'm not leaving until
Michael has his surgery.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.910
And I'm not starting
surgery until you prove

02:40.994 --> 02:43.079
you can hold up
your end of the deal.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.666
Scylla's slipping
through our fingers as we speak.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.628
Time is not on our side,
nor on your brother's.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.672
Now, you'll get full cooperation

02:52.755 --> 02:54.215
from my office.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.426
If you need anything,
just call this number.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.596
I'm gonna need everything
you've got on Self and Gretchen.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.806
Aliases, whatever you got.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.267
How about an accomplice?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.612
Now, if you're gonna want...

03:15.737 --> 03:16.613
Shut up.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.115
You can save yourself
a lot of pain

03:19.199 --> 03:20.617
and the embarrassment
of begging me to stop

03:20.700 --> 03:22.744
if you just tell me
where they are.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.954
Gretchen and Agent Turncoat?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.206
Yeah.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.208
Information like that seems
like it could be

03:28.291 --> 03:30.126
of a certain intrinsic value.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.836
If there were offers made,

03:31.920 --> 03:34.797
carrots dangled,
I could see...

03:35.798 --> 03:37.675
Look, I deserve some kind
of something here,

03:37.759 --> 03:39.552
all the work I put in.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.972
If it wasn't for me finding
Whistler's bird book then...

03:45.183 --> 03:47.852
The only thing you deserve
is the opportunity

03:47.936 --> 03:49.896
to keep your teeth
and fingernails.

03:49.979 --> 03:50.813
No. You...

03:50.897 --> 03:52.899
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.320
I'm gonna pull out every single
tooth, every single one.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.739
How about it?

03:59.822 --> 04:00.865
Look, I was just fooling...

04:00.949 --> 04:02.450
All right!

04:02.533 --> 04:05.161
Arlington Pier! Arling...
Arlington Pier!

04:05.245 --> 04:07.872
When? What time?

04:08.831 --> 04:10.541
Three o'clock.

04:12.585 --> 04:16.256
This is the last
of the anesthetic.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.675
From here on out, you shouldn't
feel a thing, Mr. Scofield.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.219
I'm going to be right over there
the whole time.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.638
I'll be right in here
the whole time.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.849
We're ready.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.940
I'm not going
to leave you, okay?

04:34.023 --> 04:36.359
Don't you dare leave me.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.884
How many surgeries has your team
performed using the gamma knife?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.137
The gamma knife has

05:04.220 --> 05:06.931
a recurrence rate
of over 13 percent.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.892
We'll be using a technique
that's more advanced.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.190
What's going on
with Michael?

05:57.273 --> 05:58.358
They're gonna operate.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.234
Just like that,
they agreed to do that?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.028
I convinced them Michael knew
who was gonna buy Scylla.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.030
What are we gonna do now?

06:04.113 --> 06:05.698
Get our hands on it
before they do.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.533
And give it to who?
I'm still working on that.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.993
Linc, I need to know
what we're doing.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.995
We finish this!
Really?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.121
'Cause it feels like
it's finishing us.

06:12.205 --> 06:16.292
You, me... we're
the only ones left, bro.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.835
One more day, and we're done.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.129
I can't do this without you.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.565
When the buyer gets here,

06:39.649 --> 06:40.817
why don't you let me
do the talking.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.068
For what?

06:42.151 --> 06:44.237
I engineered this
whole thing, Gretchen.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.279
I can handle my business.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.907
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you start

06:47.990 --> 06:49.033
by handling
that river of nerves

06:49.117 --> 06:51.577
that's running down
your forehead.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.787
Did you think this would be
easier?

06:52.870 --> 06:53.996
I hoped.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.206
But I guess I always knew

06:55.289 --> 06:57.041
it was going to come down
to a pile of bodies.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.501
I never pegged you for a killer.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.337
Yeah, well, I never
pegged you for a mom.

07:02.880 --> 07:07.385
Is there anything that you'd
like to peg me for, Don?

07:07.468 --> 07:11.305
Oh, stop. Okay?
Don't embarrass yourself.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.723
That may work on everyone
else, but right now,

07:12.807 --> 07:15.518
the only thing I'm thinking
about is that $125 million.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.020
So close up your blouse
and open your eyes,

07:18.104 --> 07:19.272
because the buyer's on the way.

07:19.355 --> 07:22.817
And I don't want any surprises
when he gets here.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.286
How much longer?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.288
Another hour or so.
Just sit tight.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.583
I need to use the men's room.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.542
Congratulations.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.793
What do you think I'm gonna do,
run?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.336
That's exactly what I think
you're gonna do.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.963
You want me to go in the back
seat, right here?

07:44.046 --> 07:45.131
I want you to have
a little bit of respect

07:45.214 --> 07:46.466
for my intelligence, Alex.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.551
I do, which is why I know
you wouldn't violate

07:48.634 --> 07:52.013
Code 42-13-72B,
which states that an individual

07:52.096 --> 07:53.890
being transported
by a representative

07:53.973 --> 07:56.184
of the criminal justice system
must be afforded the opportunity

07:56.267 --> 07:57.643
to relieve himself

07:57.727 --> 07:59.812
if the duration of the transport
is more than three hours.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.316
And I do believe we're
creeping up on that time.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.152
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.904
But I'm going to remind you
of a code.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.282
The one that says if a prisoner
attempts escape during transfer,

08:11.365 --> 08:13.367
the accompanying agent has
the right to shoot him

08:13.451 --> 08:15.411
through the back of the head.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.665
You sure you don't want
to hold it, Alex?

08:19.749 --> 08:22.502
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.676
Any pain or discomfort,
Mr. Scofield?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.178
No.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.765
Those needles, they're for...
stabilization?

08:35.848 --> 08:38.601
Not exactly. Throughout
the surgery, different portions

08:38.684 --> 08:42.063
of Michael's cerebral cortex
will be stimulated,

08:42.146 --> 08:43.648
triggering the areas

08:43.731 --> 08:46.776
that control senses like
hearing, smell, memory.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.319
That's why some people,

08:48.402 --> 08:50.196
right before death,
often speak of...

08:50.279 --> 08:51.656
Their life flashing
before their eyes.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.200
Exactly.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.369
When oxygen is cut off
to the brain,

08:56.452 --> 08:58.955
it kicks into overdrive,
tapping into every resource

08:59.038 --> 09:00.790
to continue operating the body.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.460
As a result, all of the senses
fire off at once.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.965
Everything you've ever known,
felt, believed...

09:09.048 --> 09:12.552
it all passes
in a blink of an eye.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.544
♪ ♪

09:48.671 --> 09:50.840
Hello, Michael.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.058
Charles?

10:02.351 --> 10:05.479
I guess you can probably
call me DB now.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.280
The answer is no.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.073
The answer?

10:16.407 --> 10:18.200
You're wondering if you're dead.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.785
The answer is no.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.122
Then why am I here?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.083
I believe that's a question

10:26.208 --> 10:28.377
we all need to find
the answer to.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.972
This is officially now the most
secure bathroom break

10:40.056 --> 10:41.474
in the history
of law enforcement.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.933
Yes, it is.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.561
Hey, look, if you want to cuff
me, block off all the exits,

10:45.645 --> 10:47.730
take it out and give it a tap,
if it makes you happy.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.149
Would that make you
feel happy, Alex?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.234
I hear prison
can change a man.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.778
Can we just get
this over with?

11:01.577 --> 11:02.578
All clear.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.330
You have 15 seconds.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.442
That wasn't so bad now, was it?

11:37.446 --> 11:39.365
You should've trusted me,

11:39.949 --> 11:41.659
like I trusted you.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.633
All right.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.554
We're ready to begin to isolate
the tumor now, Mr. Scofield.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.514
As we talked about,

12:04.056 --> 12:06.600
I'm going to ask you to slowly
recite the alphabet.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.270
If you have any problems
finding a letter,

12:09.353 --> 12:11.188
any problems saying a letter,

12:11.689 --> 12:13.566
you let us know. All right?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.484
All right.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.952
Okay.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.746
Ready?

12:27.663 --> 12:28.956
And begin.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.584
A...

12:31.667 --> 12:32.752
B...

12:32.835 --> 12:35.880
C...

12:35.963 --> 12:37.798
D...

12:37.882 --> 12:39.425
E...

12:39.508 --> 12:40.885
F...

12:40.968 --> 12:42.678
G...

12:42.762 --> 12:44.388
H...

12:45.097 --> 12:46.015
I...

12:46.098 --> 12:47.767
I'm sorry, Charles.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.934
For what?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.603
For everything.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.897
For all the lies I told.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.316
For all the pain I caused.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.194
Are you asking for forgiveness?

12:58.527 --> 13:00.571
I'm not sure I'm entitled to it.

13:03.073 --> 13:07.119
I guess that's for a power

13:07.203 --> 13:09.538
higher than us to decide,
isn't it?

13:14.418 --> 13:19.256
It's just hard...
hard to believe we've lost,

13:19.340 --> 13:21.300
that it was all for nothing.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.512
It doesn't have
to be.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.196
It looks like

13:42.279 --> 13:44.490
the tumor is nestled
behind the hippocampus.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.079
You have the answers, Michael.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.956
What are the questions?

13:53.082 --> 13:56.126
I don't know,
but you do.

I looked out the window,

Right now,

26:32.048 --> 26:34.384
we need to be ready
for whatever's coming.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.845
You better watch your six, Don.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.722
Okay.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.392
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

26:42.475 --> 26:43.560
I-I can't quite tell
from the monitors,

26:43.643 --> 26:46.563
but from what I can see,
the-the growth,

26:46.646 --> 26:48.064
it looks like it isn't just
on the hypothalamus.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.193
I understand that was
the initial diagnosis,

26:52.277 --> 26:55.322
but once we got in there,
it appears to have spread

26:55.405 --> 26:57.073
to the hippocampus
as well.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.366
Okay. Um,

26:58.450 --> 27:01.369
so with the removal,
will there be any memory loss?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.413
Well, in cases like this,

27:03.496 --> 27:04.873
where small portions
have to be removed,

27:04.956 --> 27:08.418
it hardly ever affects what's
referred to as "net memory."

27:08.501 --> 27:10.920
We're all tapped into
such small portions

27:11.004 --> 27:13.423
of what we've experienced
in our lifetime.

27:13.506 --> 27:16.134
The bulk of it's just kept
in storage,

27:16.217 --> 27:18.261
rarely acknowledged
by the conscious mind.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.096
So while there may be some

27:20.180 --> 27:21.348
gross memory loss,

27:21.431 --> 27:22.599
he won't ever know it's gone.

27:22.682 --> 27:25.644
Because he'll never know
it was there.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.297
Nurse?

27:54.381 --> 27:55.715
BP's dropping, 90/60.

27:55.799 --> 27:56.966
What's going on?

27:57.050 --> 27:58.426
I don't know.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.637
Increase dopamine
delivery rate to 12.5.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.519
Bargain.

28:12.565 --> 28:13.983
We'll use the Bargain
when the time...

28:14.067 --> 28:15.485
The Bargain.

28:15.568 --> 28:19.155
We'll use the Bargain
when the time is right.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.240
Bargain, Bargain...

28:21.241 --> 28:22.826
EEG's spiking.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.077
Brain activity's all
over the place.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.286
MAP's at 55.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.996
BP's erratic. Dropping.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.498
85, 84.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.041
Give him one mil
of Atropine. Michael?

28:30.125 --> 28:31.668
Are you still
with us?

28:31.751 --> 28:35.130
The best minds in the world
designed this system,

28:35.213 --> 28:36.589
and you almost beat it.

28:38.842 --> 28:42.387
But as long as we have
Scylla...

28:42.470 --> 28:44.764
...we have power...
Scylla.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.977
So what are you hearing, uh,

28:49.060 --> 28:50.186
Scylla's worth?

28:50.270 --> 28:52.188
Me, I'm hearing millions.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.106
We have power.

28:53.189 --> 28:55.191
Things have happened

28:55.275 --> 28:56.234
in the past few days that

28:56.317 --> 28:57.694
have made me uneasy.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.530
But as long as we have Scylla,
we have power.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.997
I'm sorry, Michael.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.707
-We're losing him.
-78. Get the crash cart.

29:10.790 --> 29:11.833
-Laryngeal scope--
-we need to intubate.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.042
No.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.127
What's going on?

29:14.210 --> 29:16.129
It's time to go.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.428
Michael?

29:23.511 --> 29:24.554
Michael?!

29:32.061 --> 29:35.023
Michael! What's going on?
Why's he crashing?

29:35.106 --> 29:36.566
Ms. Tancredi, you cannot...
No, it's okay.

29:36.649 --> 29:37.942
Michael, don't do this.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.527
Don't do this.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.862
Don't do this.

29:40.945 --> 29:41.946
Don't go.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.072
We're not finished
with this.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.240
Not finished yet.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.909
Michael, I'm sorry.

29:45.992 --> 29:46.993
It's time.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.620
Please, Charles.

29:48.703 --> 29:49.913
Michael, not like this.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.289
Not like this.

29:51.372 --> 29:52.457
It doesn't happen
like this.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.917
You promised me
we would finish together.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.543
It's okay.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.753
You've done your part.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.087
I haven't figured it out yet!

29:58.171 --> 30:00.256
Yes, you have.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.257
Would you do something?

30:01.341 --> 30:02.300
I'm trying!

30:05.470 --> 30:07.680
Michael, don't leave,
don't give up.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.186
Relax.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.438
You might think
it's bad,

30:15.522 --> 30:17.106
but it's not.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.276
Dying?

30:20.360 --> 30:21.820
No!

30:24.531 --> 30:26.032
Don't give up.

30:26.115 --> 30:27.283
Don't give up.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.785
Don't give up.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.220
Not everything is as it seems.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.099
Good-bye, Michael.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.310
Charles.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.125
Michael?

31:17.208 --> 31:19.252
Michael, don't leave me.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.129
Don't you dare
leave me.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.263
Sara.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.648
Sara.

31:41.941 --> 31:44.068
Company tracked the serial
code off the receipt.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.778
Gretchen just placed a
call five minutes ago

31:45.862 --> 31:48.406
-matching the tracking number.
-From where?

31:48.489 --> 31:49.532
Two miles away.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.540
I was told there'd
be three of you.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.042
Well, there aren't.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.877
You have the money?
Because that's a small case

32:00.960 --> 32:03.087
-for $125 million...
-We don't deal in cash.

32:03.171 --> 32:06.007
Once I verify the validity
of the item,

32:06.090 --> 32:09.761
the funds will be wired to
an account number you provide.

32:17.852 --> 32:19.020
The item, please.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.229
No, no, no,
you're not gonna see the item

32:20.313 --> 32:22.440
until I see the money,
okay? You'll have to

32:22.523 --> 32:25.151
forgive me if I don't trust a
shiny case with some buttons.

32:25.234 --> 32:28.154
I need to confirm
that the data is intact.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.156
Without it, the item you possess

32:30.239 --> 32:33.660
is nothing more
than a fancy box.

32:33.743 --> 32:34.827
Speaking of...

32:36.287 --> 32:37.914
Give this man the item.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.207
No, I'm not giving anyone...

32:39.290 --> 32:40.416
This is a businessman

32:40.500 --> 32:42.251
making a business transaction.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.046
One where the longer
you take,

32:45.129 --> 32:47.423
the more danger you put us
all in.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.566
Can you read what's on there?

33:08.403 --> 33:10.530
You better hope so.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.924
They're not just gonna
give us Scylla.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.092
You know what that means, right?

33:33.886 --> 33:35.096
Okay.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.402
Let's split up.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.830
Doesn't look like the
Company's black book. It's...

34:03.416 --> 34:04.417
It looks more
like a...

34:11.632 --> 34:12.759
I'm sure
you understand

34:12.842 --> 34:15.178
no one can know
where Scylla's going to.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.658
It's your lucky day, sugar.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.203
Not yours.

34:43.122 --> 34:45.208
Drop it.

34:45.666 --> 34:47.627
Cover her.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.134
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.385
Where is he?

34:56.469 --> 34:58.304
- I don't know!
- Gone.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.680
Stolen.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.642
By who?

35:03.935 --> 35:05.144
By who?

35:05.228 --> 35:08.606
If I die... you'll never know.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.103
Oh.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.273
You look beautiful.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.402
You're a liar.

35:54.777 --> 35:55.820
How'd it go?

35:57.488 --> 35:59.198
They're still
running some tests,

35:59.699 --> 36:02.243
but they feel pretty
confident they got it all.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.619
And what is this place?

36:04.871 --> 36:07.999
You need to know something
about your surgery.

36:08.916 --> 36:11.752
It was performed
by Company doctors,

36:11.836 --> 36:14.088
and the General made
all the arrangements.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.256
Why?

36:15.339 --> 36:16.507
I don't know.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.426
Lincoln's handling it.

36:18.509 --> 36:19.760
He says he has a plan.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.471
I'll be honest.
Right now, you're alive,

36:22.555 --> 36:25.016
and that's all I care about.

36:28.060 --> 36:30.188
You're gonna laugh,
but I had a dream about Scylla.

36:31.939 --> 36:35.359
The only thing we really know
about it is what Self told us.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.360
You need to rest.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.945
I'm serious.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.406
What if it's not just
the Company's little black book?

36:40.489 --> 36:41.657
What if it's...

36:41.741 --> 36:43.993
Not everything is as it seems.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.245
...something more?

36:46.329 --> 36:48.331
Like what?

36:48.414 --> 36:51.459
Something good.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.920
Why go to so much trouble

36:54.003 --> 36:55.922
to protect information
about the past,

36:56.005 --> 36:58.507
information the Company
could just delete

36:58.591 --> 37:01.344
any time they wanted to?

37:01.427 --> 37:02.970
The General said...

37:03.054 --> 37:05.932
But as long as we have Scylla,
we have power.

37:06.015 --> 37:09.477
I don't think
he was talking about power

37:09.560 --> 37:11.354
like control or influence.

37:11.437 --> 37:13.189
I think he was talking
about energy.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.816
Boron.

37:16.150 --> 37:19.028
Argon.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.197
Gallium.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.032
Indium.

37:23.115 --> 37:25.701
Bargain.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.080
There's a theory
that if you can find a way

37:29.163 --> 37:32.917
to combine these elements
into the design of a solar cell,

37:33.000 --> 37:38.297
you can harness 100%
of the sun's energy.

37:38.381 --> 37:41.217
With that kind of power,

37:41.300 --> 37:43.094
possibilities are limitless.

37:43.177 --> 37:46.973
It would certainly explain all
the security around Scylla.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.476
They're not protecting the past.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.103
They're protecting the future.

37:52.186 --> 37:53.646
Wow.

37:53.729 --> 37:55.022
Wonder what
else is on it.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.566
I mean, the equipment
you were treated with,

37:57.650 --> 37:59.402
and the drugs
they gave you--

37:59.485 --> 38:01.988
none of it exists
on the open market.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.990
Which would explain
why some people are willing

38:04.073 --> 38:06.742
to pay hundreds of millions
to get their hands on Scylla.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.120
It's not about
taking down the Company.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.413
It's about

38:10.496 --> 38:12.581
becoming the Company.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.625
It's about knowing
what they know,

38:14.709 --> 38:17.086
controlling what they know.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.964
What do we do now?

38:25.511 --> 38:27.638
So, what's the next move?

38:27.722 --> 38:29.348
I'm gonna check
on Michael.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.683
No, I mean, after that.

38:30.766 --> 38:31.809
I mean, Scylla's
out there somewhere.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.811
Are we really gonna
keep chasing it?

38:33.894 --> 38:36.147
I don't know. We'll
figure it out later.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.358
No.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.110
I won't be here, Linc.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.196
I can't do it anymore.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.449
Sara said Mike was okay,

38:46.532 --> 38:48.451
and that's all
I needed to know.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.828
But now I got
to go live my life.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.581
And that's a life where
I can go a day without seeing

38:53.664 --> 38:57.877
a dead body,
or-or almost becoming one.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.629
I'm not running away, papi.

39:00.713 --> 39:04.175
I'm-I'm just...
I'm just moving on.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.470
This was never about you.

39:07.553 --> 39:10.139
Everything you did,
you did for us.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.892
I'll never forget that.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.145
I know you got

39:16.228 --> 39:17.646
something cooking, so...

39:17.730 --> 39:20.066
whatever it is,
just be careful, okay?

39:21.942 --> 39:23.819
Yeah.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.742
Thank you.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.954
Hey.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.333
And when you and Mike
get down below

39:37.416 --> 39:38.459
and open that surf shop...

39:38.542 --> 39:40.127
Scuba shop.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.045
Scuba shop.

39:41.128 --> 39:43.672
Maybe there will be a job
there for me.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.925
You can count on it.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.898
Do you know
who took it?

40:00.981 --> 40:03.901
No, but Self
and Gretchen do.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.194
Good.

40:05.277 --> 40:06.695
Then you've got your team.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.781
I'm not working for them.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.991
You'll work with a basset hound
in a birthday hat

40:11.075 --> 40:12.034
if that's what I tell you to do.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.370
That's what being
an employee means.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.666
You're determined and dedicated.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.709
But there are holes
in your resume

40:20.793 --> 40:23.629
that Gretchen or Self
or even Bagwell can fill.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.047
Now, you all
took something from me,

40:25.131 --> 40:27.133
and you're all
going to get it back.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.803
Besides...

40:30.886 --> 40:34.515
you can't handle this
by yourself.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.309
And deep down, I
think you know that.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.272
Have them meet me outside.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.484
Who knows?

40:45.568 --> 40:47.736
You may find
that you like it here.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.613
Stranger things
have happened.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.116
They've certainly happened
in your family.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.492
Now,

40:53.576 --> 40:56.328
about Michael.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.874
Are you going to tell him,

41:00.291 --> 41:02.626
or should I?

41:12.428 --> 41:13.762
Do you have it?

41:13.846 --> 41:14.930
In my hand.

41:15.014 --> 41:17.141
Good. You know what to do.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.076
Last time I saw
you in a hospital,

41:36.160 --> 41:37.286
you busted your arm
in Little League.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.371
Yeah, some bruiser
knocked me down

41:39.455 --> 41:40.539
sliding into second.

41:40.623 --> 41:41.832
Sorry about that.

41:42.124 --> 41:43.792
But you healed
good, though, right?

41:43.876 --> 41:44.960
Yeah.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.379
This will, too.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.509
Look, whatever plan
you're working on

41:51.592 --> 41:53.802
to get us out of here,
we better make a move on it.

41:53.886 --> 41:56.180
You're not getting
out of here, Michael.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.309
What do you mean?

42:00.392 --> 42:01.769
I made a deal.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.938
Your life
in exchange for Scylla.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.775
Why would you do that?

42:07.858 --> 42:09.860
Same reason you covered
your body in tattoos

42:09.944 --> 42:11.570
and-and broke
into Fox River.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.197
This is not just about us...

42:13.280 --> 42:16.033
That's exactly who it's about.
It's all it's ever been about.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.579
We do this one thing
for the Company,

42:20.663 --> 42:22.498
then they set
us up for life.

42:22.581 --> 42:23.666
And you actually trust them?

42:24.917 --> 42:26.210
Who else am I gonna trust?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.379
The government?
Guys like Don Self?

42:28.462 --> 42:30.756
I'm done watching loved ones
and friends die, Michael.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.717
Scylla isn't what
we thought it was.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.679
-Not even close.
-I don't care.

42:37.263 --> 42:38.847
I don't understand
how you can say that.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.225
'Cause the only thing
worth fighting for is family.

42:41.308 --> 42:44.603
I'm gonna do everything
and anything I can to end this,

42:44.687 --> 42:45.980
so you, me,
all of us

42:46.063 --> 42:47.648
can get on with our lives.

42:47.731 --> 42:49.024
You think you can do that

42:49.108 --> 42:50.985
knowing what you know
about the Company?

42:51.068 --> 42:52.945
You want to know
what I know about the Company?

42:53.028 --> 42:56.156
Mom worked for them
before she died.

42:58.075 --> 43:01.704
I'm just moving on
in the family business.

43:01.787 --> 43:02.830
Linc, don't do this.

43:02.913 --> 43:03.831
It's done.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.833
Linc? Linc!
