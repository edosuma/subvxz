do I have to do this for?

09:27.136 --> 09:28.345
Until they're finished.

09:29.261 --> 09:31.428
Can Jordi come help?

09:32.095 --> 09:33.553
[exhales]

09:33.553 --> 09:35.720
I don't really want you hanging
out with Jordi right now.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.804
Why? I didn't ditch
because of her.

09:37.804 --> 09:39.261
Look, if you want to call
one of your classmates

09:39.261 --> 09:40.387
to come help you--

09:40.387 --> 09:42.178
I hate everyone
at that fucking school.

09:42.178 --> 09:43.595
[sighs]

09:43.595 --> 09:46.804
Well, then,
I guess you're on your own.

09:46.804 --> 09:48.261
Okay.

09:48.261 --> 09:49.637
And do me a favor?

09:49.637 --> 09:51.929
Take it easy on the
fucking f-bombs, okay?

10:02.178 --> 10:05.261

and then she fucked up.

10:05.261 --> 10:08.136
Are you guys both gonna wear,
like, dresses?

10:08.136 --> 10:10.345
Why you got to say it like that?

10:10.345 --> 10:12.095
I don't know. I'm grossed out.

10:12.095 --> 10:14.387
Fuck.

10:14.387 --> 10:16.762
You know what's scary?

10:16.762 --> 10:20.011
I've never actually seen
what a good marriage looks like.

10:20.011 --> 10:23.929
My dad left
the day my sister was born.

10:23.929 --> 10:26.470
Well, my parents kicked
me out of the house

10:26.470 --> 10:27.804
and sleep in separate beds,

-What?
-[Sophie] Well,

10:34.512 --> 10:35.679
we went rogue.
Won't they be pissed?

10:35.679 --> 10:37.303
They can't be. We crushed it.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.929
Aren't agents already

-Yeah.
-[Alice] Yeah.

10:41.887 --> 10:44.762
See? They're probably here
to celebrate me. Come on.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.261
You got this.

10:48.261 --> 10:49.512
It's all you.

10:49.512 --> 10:52.261
And this is all me.

10:52.261 --> 10:54.845
If Porter stands any chance
of winning this,

10:54.845 --> 10:56.345
she needs to give voters
a reason

10:56.345 --> 10:59.095
to look past
the Felicity Adams scandal.

10:59.095 --> 11:01.512
If she can do that remains to
be seen. Her favorability...

11:01.512 --> 11:03.220
Dani.

11:03.220 --> 11:05.178
Hi. Great to see you.

11:05.178 --> 11:06.428
Excited to be here.

11:06.428 --> 11:07.887
Yeah, look, so, I'm just
gonna throw you right in.

11:07.887 --> 11:09.512
We got a meeting in Bette's
office in five minutes.

11:09.512 --> 11:11.512
-Okay?
-Okay. If you'll just point me

11:11.512 --> 11:12.595
to my office
so I can put my things down,

11:12.595 --> 11:14.470
-I'll be right there.
-[chuckles]

11:14.470 --> 11:17.303

Judy Chicago loaned it to me.

11:55.428 --> 11:57.345
I've always loved her.

[chuckles softly]

11:58.887 --> 12:02.720
I'll never forget the first time
I saw The Dinner Party.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.220
She's always had
such a clear mission.

12:06.220 --> 12:10.053
You know, like she never
deviated from the goal.

Bottom line is,

12:23.679 --> 12:25.053
and I hate to be
the bad guy here,

12:25.053 --> 12:27.804
but you can't change
your interview guest

12:27.804 --> 12:29.053
at the last minute.

12:29.053 --> 12:31.011
You can't just interview
your friends, right?

12:31.011 --> 12:33.595
Well, I thought
it went really well.

12:33.595 --> 12:35.011
-Didn't you?
-[Barry] You got lucky.

12:35.011 --> 12:38.095
When we bought your
podcast, we bought a brand.

12:38.095 --> 12:41.512
A poppy, fun, palatable
lesbian brand.

12:41.512 --> 12:43.303
We want to build off that.

12:43.303 --> 12:45.929
I do, too.
I really do. I...

12:45.929 --> 12:49.804
It's just I'm a very...
curious person,

12:49.804 --> 12:51.887
and I think
my audience is, too.

12:51.887 --> 12:54.428
And I just want to give them
a little credit. You know,

12:54.428 --> 12:57.136
I think we have a real
opportunity to make an impact.

12:57.136 --> 12:59.470
[Barry] And we will
always be completely open

12:59.470 --> 13:01.303
to your ideas.

13:01.303 --> 13:02.804
But we got to stay true

13:02.804 --> 13:04.303
to our season one
audience, right?

13:04.303 --> 13:06.595
But they might be interested
in something more substantial.

13:06.595 --> 13:07.637
[Drew]
It's unlikely.

13:07.637 --> 13:09.470

13:09.470 --> 13:10.637

13:10.637 --> 13:13.136
[Barry]
This is Drew Wilson.

13:13.136 --> 13:14.303
-Oh.
-[Drew chuckles]

13:14.303 --> 13:16.345
-Big fan.
-[Barry] Drew has written

13:16.345 --> 13:17.762
for Seth, Sarah

13:17.762 --> 13:19.470
and all the Jimmys.

13:19.470 --> 13:20.595
We want you to
get to know him,

13:20.595 --> 13:22.261
see where he might be useful.

13:22.261 --> 13:24.720
Take some of the
pressure off you a bit.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.428
Let him help
maintain the brand

13:26.428 --> 13:28.512
that your audience has
come to love, okay?

13:28.512 --> 13:30.637
I am so sorry to interrupt,

13:30.637 --> 13:33.303
but, um...

13:33.303 --> 13:36.679
Uh, hmm. Yeah, I don't,
I don't know what that means.

13:36.679 --> 13:38.679
Oh. Ri-- uh, his school called.

13:42.261 --> 13:43.762
[Finley]
Yeah, he's sick

13:43.762 --> 13:44.804
and, uh, Nat's in session
with clients

13:44.804 --> 13:46.345
and Gigi's away, I guess?

13:46.345 --> 13:48.303
So, um...

13:48.303 --> 13:49.637
So...

13:49.637 --> 13:51.804
-so, me, then?
-Uh...

13:51.804 --> 13:53.053
-Looking like it, yeah.
-Okay.

13:53.053 --> 13:54.845
Everything okay?

13:54.845 --> 13:56.178
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:56.178 --> 13:58.387
Um, it's a, it's,

14:02.345 --> 14:03.679
They don't h-have to, if...

14:03.679 --> 14:04.845
[Barry]
Well, it's not a problem.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.553
-Uh, Drew will fill you in.
-Yeah.

14:06.553 --> 14:09.470
Um, cool. Well,
I am gonna go to school.

14:09.470 --> 14:11.512
[soft laughter]

14:11.512 --> 14:14.720
Thanks. Thanks. Okay.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.887
All right, look,
you got to call Shane,

14:16.887 --> 14:18.387
-'cause I am not
doing this alone.
-Copy that.

14:18.387 --> 14:20.720
-And he better be
really fucking sick.
-Copy that.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.762
[Drew]
Uh, so, where were we?

14:21.762 --> 14:23.512
I absolutely hear you.
We should not

14:23.512 --> 14:25.387
have gone over your head.
That won't happen again.

14:25.387 --> 14:28.053
But we're getting some really
interesting interview requests.

14:28.053 --> 14:30.637
And we're excited about that,
but you can't take

14:30.637 --> 14:32.804
big swings like that
without our approval.

14:32.804 --> 14:34.428
Well, Lena Waithe
wants to come on.

14:34.428 --> 14:36.929
-She's perfect.
-And fun.

14:36.929 --> 14:38.887
Uh, maybe we could, uh,
play a game with her.

14:38.887 --> 14:40.720
Uh, Alice and Lena could, uh,

14:40.720 --> 14:42.136
play a drinking game.

14:42.136 --> 14:43.720
-We could do it blindfolded.
-Yes, yes, yes.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.387
-[laughing]
-[babbling]

14:45.387 --> 14:48.512
Yes, and she and Alice could
have an honest conversation

14:48.512 --> 14:51.845
about the importance
of queer representation in film.

14:51.845 --> 14:54.178
-Well, sure, sure.
-Yeah, yeah.

14:54.178 --> 14:55.845
Uh, Drew will fill in
the details.

14:55.845 --> 14:58.095
-Mm-hmm.
-Great get, Sophie.

14:58.095 --> 14:59.929
[Pierce]
I think we dodged a bullet.

14:59.929 --> 15:01.762
If we bring up
the affair again,

15:01.762 --> 15:03.136
it becomes
a self-inflicted wound.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.929
I think it's best
if we focus on our town hall

15:05.929 --> 15:07.720
-at the LGBT Center.
-I hear you.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.679
I'm concerned if we don't take
control of the narrative,

15:09.679 --> 15:11.095
it'll bite us in the ass.

15:11.095 --> 15:12.929
And what do you propose we do?

15:12.929 --> 15:14.887
Get an on-the-record statement
from Felicity Adams.

15:14.887 --> 15:15.929
She and a mediator
are available

15:15.929 --> 15:17.553
-to come in today.
-[Pierce] Wait a minute,

15:17.553 --> 15:19.095
-you already reached out?
-Sorry, I thought I was

15:19.095 --> 15:20.762
-taking point on this.
-Wait, why would she agree

15:20.762 --> 15:22.053
-to come here?
-[Dani] Well, I offered

15:22.053 --> 15:26.011
a neutral location, but Felicity
seemed fine to come in.

15:26.762 --> 15:28.136
I can push back if you want,

15:28.136 --> 15:29.970
but I do prefer
that we do it on our turf.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.512
-No, it's-it's fine.
-[Pierce] Bette's already given

15:31.512 --> 15:32.762
an account of what's happened.

15:32.762 --> 15:34.595
[Dani]
Yeah, But Felicity hasn't.

15:34.595 --> 15:36.387
We want to get ahead
of any potential discrepancies

15:36.387 --> 15:37.428
in your stories.

15:38.845 --> 15:41.220
We need to protect
this campaign.

15:42.387 --> 15:43.720
[Pierce]
Okay.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.804
Let's circle the wagons.

15:44.804 --> 15:46.095
-Bring her in here.
-Okay.

15:46.095 --> 15:47.929
And, uh,
take her up the back stairs.

15:47.929 --> 15:49.387
I know how to be discreet.

15:49.387 --> 15:50.887
But do you know
where the back stairs are?

15:50.887 --> 15:52.428
No, I don't.
[chuckles]

15:52.428 --> 15:56.053
I don't want Angie to be here
when she comes in.

15:56.053 --> 15:57.512
Kacey is taking a group out
to canvass,

15:57.512 --> 15:58.804
so she can go with them.

15:58.804 --> 16:00.303
Great. Thank you.

16:01.970 --> 16:03.970
[Dani]
And, looking ahead,

16:03.970 --> 16:07.053
is there anything else
I need to know?

16:07.053 --> 16:08.261
Meaning?

16:08.261 --> 16:10.303
Is there anything else people
could use against you?

16:15.053 --> 16:17.512
You are scheduled to be
at Glassell Park Elementary

16:17.512 --> 16:19.428
for a photo op in 45 minutes.

16:19.428 --> 16:23.095
-Please have the car waiting.
-You got it.

16:25.679 --> 16:28.804
Um, okay.

16:28.804 --> 16:32.136
Well, I spent a night in jail.

16:32.136 --> 16:35.720
Uh, civil disobedience.
The charges were dropped.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.178
Okay.

16:38.679 --> 16:40.845
I cheated on my ex-wife.

16:40.845 --> 16:42.679
Does she know
you were unfaithful?

16:42.679 --> 16:45.428
[laughs softly]
Yes. She knows.

16:45.428 --> 16:46.929
-Anything else?
-A friend of mine

16:46.929 --> 16:49.720
died by suicide on my property.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.053
She drowned in my pool.

16:52.053 --> 16:55.887
-Her name?
-Jenny Schecter.

16:55.887 --> 17:00.387

-Hey, thanks.

17:03.345 --> 17:05.178
-Call me if you need me.
-[Drew] I will.

17:05.178 --> 17:07.387
[laughs] Except you won't
hear from me at all.

17:07.387 --> 17:08.261
Okay, I'll see you.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.887
Nobody likes
the new guy, right?

17:10.887 --> 17:12.637
-[laughs softly]
-But I am excited

17:12.637 --> 17:14.095

17:14.095 --> 17:17.553
I'm just here to be helpful.

17:17.553 --> 17:19.804
Sure.
[chuckles]

17:19.804 --> 17:21.512
I'm gonna go find my office.

17:21.512 --> 17:24.970
Ah, I-I think
it's that way, boss.

17:28.053 --> 17:29.261
Definitely not that way.

17:29.261 --> 17:31.720
Yeah, that guy's
a real bag of dicks.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.553
-Mm-hmm.
-[groans softly]

17:33.553 --> 17:34.804
I don't want to talk to Dani.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.428
I think I need a drink.

17:37.428 --> 17:38.637
I'll hang with you.

17:38.637 --> 17:41.929
Uh, that's okay.

17:41.929 --> 17:42.929
-[chuckles]
-I'm-a call my sister.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.220
-All right?
-Okay.

17:44.220 --> 17:46.095
-You take care, buddy.
-All right, I'll just...

17:46.095 --> 17:48.720
No worries. I'll hydrate.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.220
All good here.

17:50.220 --> 17:51.720
-[phone ringing]
-[Shane] Okay, okay, buddy.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.929
Okay. All right. Come on, Alice.

17:52.929 --> 17:54.637
-The door, get the door.
-Alice, focus.

17:54.637 --> 17:56.970
-Yeah. What do you need?
-Can you get me a bucket?
Please.

17:56.970 --> 17:59.136
-Like, a what? Like, a--
-A bucket, Alice.

17:59.136 --> 18:01.053
A bucket. What's a bucket?
Are you okay?

18:01.053 --> 18:02.929

27:00.804 --> 27:03.595
Hello. How's it going over here?

27:03.595 --> 27:05.261
You guys need
another one of these, right?

27:06.845 --> 27:08.762
Yes, that's right,
and some more of those.

27:08.762 --> 27:11.261
I'll be right back.
How's it going over here?

27:11.261 --> 27:13.470

of these, don't you?
-Hey. Uh...

Yeah, yeah, yeah?

Yeah, yeah? How about you?
How's your night going?

27:21.011 --> 27:23.095
Over here playing
hard to get, huh?

27:23.095 --> 27:24.845
No, no, no.

27:24.845 --> 27:27.136
No, but really, I'm glad

Girl, I know who you are.

27:29.595 --> 27:30.845
Everyone in the city
knows who you are.

27:30.845 --> 27:32.512
-You're, like, a living legend.
-No, no, no. No, I'm not.

27:32.512 --> 27:34.345
How adorable is that?

I wish the whole bar was
filled with girls like us.

-Who is that woman?

27:57.512 --> 28:01.512
That's Tess. My girlfriend.

28:08.095 --> 28:09.845

Poor thing,
he's exhausted.

28:16.512 --> 28:20.387
Well, I'm sure;
he puked everywhere.

28:20.387 --> 28:24.220
Oh, that's why the Crock-Pot's
out on the curb.

28:24.220 --> 28:27.553

for taking care of him.

been hard.

I mean, I-I left a really
big meeting today.

Well, I'm so sorry.
It's not gonna happen tomorrow.

28:39.679 --> 28:44.261
I called Gigi, and she'll
be here in the morning.

Oh. Okay.

28:50.220 --> 28:51.470
What are you feeling?

28:51.470 --> 28:54.303
I'm feeling like
a babysitter.

28:54.303 --> 28:55.303
Okay, that's not a feeling.

You can't ask me to be
more a part of their lives,

29:21.679 --> 29:24.261
and then call in Gigi
when you feel like

29:24.261 --> 29:25.970
I can't handle something.

29:27.804 --> 29:30.929
You're right.
Those are confusing messages.

what you're thinking?

But if you give it to her,
make sure you mean it.

48:46.387 --> 48:49.595
I know.

48:49.595 --> 48:51.762
[exhales]
I will.

48:51.762 --> 48:53.720
Look at me.

48:55.512 --> 48:58.220
You're not your father.

49:00.470 --> 49:02.887
I know that.

49:02.887 --> 49:05.387
We raised you
to be strong.

49:05.387 --> 49:08.470
And you're strong enough
to leave if you need to.

49:08.470 --> 49:09.929
You know that.

49:09.929 --> 49:13.637
-[chuckles softly]
-But it takes...

49:13.637 --> 49:16.637
-it takes true strength to stay.
-Hmm.

49:16.637 --> 49:18.387
[chuckles]

49:18.387 --> 49:21.512
-This is a celebration time.
-[laughs]

49:21.512 --> 49:24.095
Let's go to the party.
Come on.

49:25.970 --> 49:28.136
["Aute Cuture"

49:36.011 --> 49:37.637
Dude, Sophie's grandma

49:37.637 --> 49:39.011
-can cook.
-Yeah.

49:39.011 --> 49:40.345
Hey, hand me a napkin?

49:42.512 --> 49:44.178
[phone chimes]

49:44.178 --> 49:47.679
Oh, shit. I didn't think
she was gonna text me.

49:47.679 --> 49:50.136
-That's cool.
-Who?

49:50.136 --> 49:51.970
Girl from last night, Rebecca.

50:05.178 --> 50:07.970
Fuck, I should've invited him.

50:07.970 --> 50:12.178
[Finley]
Dude, next time.

50:12.178 --> 50:14.261
-These have to be our last ones.
-Yeah, you're right.

50:14.261 --> 50:16.720
I want to be drunk,
but not like dizzy drunk

50:16.720 --> 50:19.178
for this girl, you know?

50:19.178 --> 50:20.387
Salud.

50:20.387 --> 50:21.804
Mmm.

50:24.136 --> 50:27.053
Catch you on the flip side.
[shouts]

50:29.261 --> 50:30.220
[laughs]

50:30.220 --> 50:33.011
Hey, everyone. Everybody.

50:33.011 --> 50:35.595
Uh, if I could get,
uh, everyone's attention

50:35.595 --> 50:37.220
for a second, um...

50:37.220 --> 50:40.136
Thank you so much
for being here tonight.

50:40.136 --> 50:42.720
You are all so beautiful
I could just cry,

50:42.720 --> 50:45.387
-but I won't.
-[laughter]

50:45.387 --> 50:48.387
My two favorite people in the
entire world are getting married

50:48.387 --> 50:51.845
and rather than, uh,
butcher this moment

50:51.845 --> 50:54.720
with my own very
questionable wisdom,

50:54.720 --> 50:56.887
I dug up something

50:56.887 --> 50:59.261
by one of Sophie's
favorite poets, Alix Olson.

51:00.679 --> 51:02.845
-[mouths] I love you.
-"Living, we have learned,

51:02.845 --> 51:05.011
can be both sloppy
and precise.

51:05.011 --> 51:07.261
And so, you choose
your careful witness

51:07.261 --> 51:10.095
to your silly little life.

51:10.095 --> 51:12.595
You begin to trace
each other's journeys,

51:12.595 --> 51:15.261
you begin to chart
each other's pace.

51:15.261 --> 51:17.929
You start to notice
all the sweetness

51:17.929 --> 51:20.136
and the details of their ways.

51:20.136 --> 51:24.011
Because loving seeks
a language of solace.

51:24.011 --> 51:26.387
It speaks volumes
about tomorrow

51:26.387 --> 51:29.470
when you are fluent
in forgiveness.

51:29.470 --> 51:32.970
Sometimes familiar
becomes magic.

51:32.970 --> 51:36.970
Sometimes magic needs distance.

51:36.970 --> 51:40.220
Sometimes space
is what shapes it.

51:40.220 --> 51:43.345
And the shape is not instant.

51:43.345 --> 51:47.303
Sometimes the horizon's
surprising.

51:47.303 --> 51:50.095
And the view is worth risking.

51:50.095 --> 51:52.303
And the risk is a long wait,

51:52.303 --> 51:54.887
but this girl is persistent.

51:54.887 --> 51:57.804
Sometimes a future just means

51:57.804 --> 51:59.970
that each day is worth finding.

51:59.970 --> 52:02.970
And this day is a presence,

52:02.970 --> 52:05.637
and this moment is shining.

52:05.637 --> 52:06.970
[moaning]

52:06.970 --> 52:10.136
Sometimes her prayers
are just... soothing.

52:10.136 --> 52:14.970
Sometimes her face
is just lovely.

52:14.970 --> 52:17.887
Years,
years spent searching.

52:17.887 --> 52:21.303
Sometimes people get lucky."

52:22.053 --> 52:24.679
So, cheers to Dani and Sophie.

52:24.679 --> 52:25.970
We are all

52:25.970 --> 52:29.011
-so happy for you.
-[cheering]

52:29.011 --> 52:31.512
Love you guys.

-Come on, give me a little turn.
