13:38.241 --> 13:40.342
[Zipping]

13:40.343 --> 13:43.749
This calls for an evil laugh!

13:43.750 --> 13:45.100
Tee!

13:45.101 --> 13:48.281
All: Tee-hee! Tee-hee!

13:50.219 --> 13:51.705
Wow!

13:51.706 --> 13:54.168
They really decorated the Ant Farm!

13:54.169 --> 13:56.190
This is so cool!

13:56.191 --> 13:57.796
Thanks...

13:57.797 --> 14:00.261
Guys? Where'd they go?

14:00.262 --> 14:03.297
And why is no one else at this party?

14:03.298 --> 14:06.400
Oh. Here come some people.

14:06.401 --> 14:07.568
Hi.

14:07.569 --> 14:09.883
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Watch it!

14:09.884 --> 14:12.372
Wow, this guy really
wants to dance with me.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.613
[Humming classical music]

14:16.979 --> 14:18.899
Whoa!

14:21.922 --> 14:23.962
[Music]

14:25.556 --> 14:27.490
Winter: There you are!

14:27.491 --> 14:29.983
You thought you could
escape, but you can't!

14:29.984 --> 14:33.314
Now get to work! These pebbles
are not going to make themselves.

14:33.315 --> 14:36.317
Interesting factoid, pebbles
actually do make themselves,

14:36.318 --> 14:40.218
thanks to the wonders of erosion!

14:40.256 --> 14:43.423
You don't understand. We're
not mutants, we're humans!

14:43.424 --> 14:47.091
Then explain your hideous appearance.

14:47.092 --> 14:50.512
I ask her that every day.

14:51.814 --> 14:54.097
We're just wearing Halloween costumes!

14:54.098 --> 14:57.338
Just turn him to stone!

15:00.273 --> 15:03.153
See? Rubber snakes!

15:05.385 --> 15:08.505
Nice try, mutant scum.

15:08.698 --> 15:13.052
Obviously, you figured out a way to
transform your appearance to look human.

15:13.053 --> 15:16.006
No, it's true! See?
These are fake fangs!

15:16.007 --> 15:17.740
[Grunting]

15:17.741 --> 15:20.742
Why did I put these
in with rubber cement?

15:20.743 --> 15:24.643
[Giggling] Because I told you to.

15:25.511 --> 15:30.551
I'm not a catfish! See,
I don't have whiskers!

15:30.572 --> 15:36.472
Just because you bleach them,
doesn't mean you don't have them.

15:42.732 --> 15:44.499
Okay, we need to fit in.

15:44.500 --> 15:50.140
Let's act like a group of
humans spending time together.

15:51.636 --> 15:54.095
Hey, guys. Have you seen human Chyna?

15:54.096 --> 15:58.846
I trimmed my bangs in her room,
and they kind of slithered away.

15:58.847 --> 16:01.455
Good! Now shave the rest of them off.

16:01.456 --> 16:03.461
Along with your leg
snakes, your armpit snakes,

16:03.462 --> 16:06.687
and that one snake growing
out of the mole on your back!

16:06.688 --> 16:08.326
What's going on?

16:08.327 --> 16:10.655
We tricked the real humans
into dressing like us

16:10.656 --> 16:12.659
and then we sent them to mutant world.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.661
Now we can stay here forever!

16:14.662 --> 16:17.598
You sent the humans to our dimension?

16:17.599 --> 16:19.529
But they're going to be
imprisoned and forced to

16:19.530 --> 16:21.998
work for Winter in the
aquarium supplies industry!

16:21.999 --> 16:24.259
Ah, the best job I ever had.

16:24.260 --> 16:29.584
Except for those two glorious
hours as a teller at the Blood Bank.

16:29.585 --> 16:33.647
- You guys are monsters!
- Shh! Don't blow our cover!

16:33.648 --> 16:37.280
You know, just because we're cold-blooded
doesn't mean we have to act cold-blooded.

16:37.281 --> 16:38.979
Ugh, I hate cold blood!

16:38.980 --> 16:41.588
But if you pop it in the
microwave for 20 seconds...

16:41.589 --> 16:43.689
[Kisses]

16:43.791 --> 16:46.359
I'm going to go rescue them.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.046
Even if I have to do it myself.

16:49.047 --> 16:50.698
[Zipping]

16:50.699 --> 16:53.939
Wow! What's this place?

16:54.736 --> 16:57.796
Oops. Wrong dimension!

17:22.430 --> 17:27.770
I keep telling you, I can't
turn anyone into stone!

17:32.841 --> 17:35.901
Well, that was weird.

17:36.411 --> 17:39.513
It's me. I'm here to rescue
you! All we have to do is...

17:39.514 --> 17:41.434
Whoa!

17:48.590 --> 17:49.950
Don't hit me.

17:49.951 --> 17:53.445
In this case, you actually
can get blood from a stone.

17:53.446 --> 17:56.026
Who said that?

17:57.015 --> 18:00.368
Something strange is going on here.

18:00.369 --> 18:03.004
I'm not sure this is a real statue.

18:03.005 --> 18:05.030
Are you a statue or not?

18:05.031 --> 18:07.707
- I'm a statue.
- Okay then.

18:07.708 --> 18:09.280
Wait!

18:09.281 --> 18:12.862
If you were really a statue, you
wouldn't have answered that question

18:12.863 --> 18:17.783
because everyone knows
that statues can't hear.

18:19.209 --> 18:21.588
Fine, I'm not a statue.

18:21.589 --> 18:25.429
But you're about to become one!

18:26.969 --> 18:30.664
Why aren't you turning to
stone? It works on everyone.

18:30.665 --> 18:33.183
Well, except...

18:33.184 --> 18:35.235
Mutants.

18:35.236 --> 18:36.915
You're a mutant!

18:36.916 --> 18:40.216
What? I'm not a mutant.

18:40.373 --> 18:45.914
It's working! I'm turning to
stone! Look at me! I'm a statue!

18:45.915 --> 18:49.695
- It worked!
- Run! The window!

18:52.755 --> 18:55.390
No! Don't open the window...

18:55.391 --> 18:57.551
[Howling]

19:00.240 --> 19:02.415
Winter is a mutant!

19:02.416 --> 19:04.666
Well, the joke's on her.

19:04.667 --> 19:08.071
This wolf stole her clothes.

19:08.072 --> 19:11.723
And you made fun of my whiskers?

19:11.724 --> 19:15.924
Wait, if you're a mutant, then why
would you imprison other mutants?

19:15.925 --> 19:20.065
Because, by ridding the
world of creatures like you,

19:20.066 --> 19:24.787
I will become the world's
most powerful mutant!

19:24.788 --> 19:28.628
And aquarium supplies distributor.

19:28.724 --> 19:30.276
Well, if you're a mutant too,

19:30.277 --> 19:33.829
then you have to either get locked up
with the rest of us or set us all free.

19:33.830 --> 19:35.732
There's a third option.

19:35.733 --> 19:38.161
I tear you to pieces.

19:38.162 --> 19:40.116
[Snarling]

19:40.117 --> 19:41.671
Bad dog! Sit!

19:41.672 --> 19:44.012
[Whimpering]

19:44.608 --> 19:46.843
I can't believe you all
came back to help me.

19:46.844 --> 19:48.429
Even you, Lexi.

19:48.430 --> 19:51.222
Actually, she refused, so we
had to bait her into coming.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.979
Cut me loose!

19:52.980 --> 19:55.800
We got a fighter!

19:58.270 --> 20:01.242
Don't grab us! Grab
her! She's a mutant, too!

20:01.243 --> 20:03.463
What? No!

20:04.098 --> 20:07.818
What gives you that impression?

20:16.085 --> 20:17.875
This mutant world is crazy.

20:17.876 --> 20:20.872
I can't believe there's a
Winter even more evil than ours.

20:20.873 --> 20:26.693
Yes, but you have to admit,
she has very reasonable prices.

20:27.069 --> 20:29.394
I'm sorry you were
tricked and imprisoned.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.092
You don't have to be sorry.

20:31.093 --> 20:35.329
You're the one who came
back to save us. Thank you.

20:35.330 --> 20:38.099
I think this calls for a hug.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.140
Chynas?

20:46.869 --> 20:50.018
Pixie Grundy, what were you doing...

20:50.019 --> 20:51.638
Down there?

20:51.639 --> 20:54.135
Meeting with my lawyers.

20:54.136 --> 20:57.513
I've regained full
control of the Mutant Farm.

20:57.514 --> 21:00.466
This place will be a school after all.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.507
A place where mutants can
feel free to be who they are...

21:03.508 --> 21:07.588
- And do what they do.
- [Croaking]

21:08.673 --> 21:12.116
All right, well, good luck.
