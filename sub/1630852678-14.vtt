That's glass.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.748

Anyway...

Nice uniform.

Huh?

at Karen's salon

23:19.199 --> 23:23.036
looking for [gasps] you.

23:23.136 --> 23:24.705
- I know.
It's bullshit.

23:24.805 --> 23:26.707
- What kinda bullshit, Zac?

23:26.807 --> 23:28.442
- ZAC: I'm not telling you.

23:28.542 --> 23:31.445

23:31.545 --> 23:33.947

But it wasn't me.

23:34.047 --> 23:36.149
And they clearing it up.
So that's all I'm

23:36.250 --> 23:39.453

What else do you want?

23:41.455 --> 23:44.224

That's why I'm really here.

for a long time.

24:43.717 --> 24:45.285

24:45.385 --> 24:50.891
And the same shit that you used
to do to Karen, he's doing.

24:50.991 --> 24:53.994
And look where that got you.
- Right. Look where it got me.

24:54.094 --> 24:57.164

much better woman.

24:57.264 --> 24:59.066

- Mm.

- That's interesting.
You learned, but you're still

the same shit you used to do.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.041

But you learned.

25:08.141 --> 25:09.610

- DANNI: Hm?

25:11.278 --> 25:13.080
- When are you gonna learn?
Why you giving him

25:13.180 --> 25:15.415

- I'm not, and that's none

25:15.516 --> 25:16.750

- You are.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.719
You like him and you know it.
So, stop.

25:18.819 --> 25:20.554
- I will never take
relationship advice from you,

25:20.654 --> 25:22.956
especially the way you
treated Karen.

25:23.056 --> 25:25.826
- The way I treated Karen?
'Cause it was only me, right?

25:25.926 --> 25:27.194
- Okay
- ZAC: It was only me.

25:27.294 --> 25:30.063

were her fault,

25:30.163 --> 25:33.767
potential baby mamas,
the cheating was her fault.

25:33.867 --> 25:36.403
- Listen, don't talk about
diseases, seeing as how

25:36.503 --> 25:41.542

is licking butts.

25:41.642 --> 25:45.012
Mm, it's awfully quiet
over there, Daniella.

already

25:47.014 --> 25:48.916

giving him a hard time.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.555

a hard time.

25:54.655 --> 25:55.889

like him.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.158
- I do.
- So then, what's the problem?

25:58.258 --> 26:01.195
- We don't have a lot in common.
He doesn't understand me.

26:01.295 --> 26:03.997
- That's bullshit, bro.

26:04.097 --> 26:06.767
- You've talked to him, right?
- All the time.

26:06.867 --> 26:10.337

about cows?

26:10.437 --> 26:12.606
Like, how much can you
stand it?

26:12.706 --> 26:14.541
- He does talk about cows a lot.
- DANNI: Mm-hmm.

26:14.641 --> 26:17.511
- But that's besides the point.
He talks about other stuff.

26:17.611 --> 26:20.347
Anything I throw at him,
he can handle it.

26:20.447 --> 26:24.117
- I don't expect you
to understand, I really don't.

26:24.218 --> 26:27.521
Really don't see why you're
putting yourself in this,

26:27.621 --> 26:29.223
but okay.

26:29.323 --> 26:32.860

Seriously, just tell me.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.729
Just tell me the truth, bro.

26:35.829 --> 26:38.265

a risk of losing him.

26:50.744 --> 26:53.280

to take.

26:53.380 --> 26:57.784

hill ready to die on it, huh?

26:57.885 --> 27:01.121
Just let me be honest,
and I'm gonna be as a friend,

27:01.221 --> 27:02.389

But trust me,

you ain't gonna

finding a needle in a corncob.
