<i> It's weird,</i>

00:30.071 --> 00:32.449
<i>the things you do</i>
<i>when you're broken up with.</i>

00:32.532 --> 00:34.951
<i>I considered stepping</i>
<i>in front of a car the other day</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:36.786
<i>just so you'd look at me.</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:40.040
<i>I know, I should run.</i>

00:40.749 --> 00:43.251
<i>Candace could storm in</i>
<i>with a SWAT team at any moment,</i>

00:43.334 --> 00:45.462
<i>and, honestly, it would be a convenience.</i>

00:45.545 --> 00:49.758
<i>Everything hurts,</i>
<i>and nothing is okay without you, Love.</i>

00:58.266 --> 01:00.852
<i>You... don't make it easy to check in.</i>

01:01.519 --> 01:04.272
<i>I'm shut out, and you want me to know it.</i>

01:06.441 --> 01:08.651
<i>I just want to know you're okay, Love.</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:12.280
<i>And, maybe, to know you're hurting too.</i>

01:13.281 --> 01:14.783
<i>Goddamn curtains.</i>

01:15.366 --> 01:16.284
<i> I...</i>

01:16.367 --> 01:18.161
<i>What the...?</i>

01:18.620 --> 01:20.330
<i>Who the fuck is that?</i>

01:28.630 --> 01:31.341
<i> There are a lot of seedy characters</i>
<i>in this town, Love.</i>

01:31.424 --> 01:34.803
<i>It's a good thing you moved</i>
<i>your spare key to-- to the bird house!</i>

01:37.764 --> 01:39.557
Shit. Shit.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.610
<i> If I go over there,</i>
<i>you'll know I was watching.</i>

01:50.693 --> 01:52.862
<i>If I don't-- Oh, damn it.</i>

02:11.714 --> 02:12.799
<i> I get it now.</i>

02:13.091 --> 02:14.843
<i>The curtains aren't to shut me out.</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:18.555
<i>They're a kindness</i>
<i>because you've already moved on.</i>

02:33.027 --> 02:33.862
Okay.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.197
<i> Not so long ago,</i>

02:36.823 --> 02:39.576
<i>that was me,</i>
<i>with your fingers in my mouth.</i>

02:39.659 --> 02:42.537
<i>Me, eating your delicious cooking.</i>

02:42.620 --> 02:44.998
<i>Me, tasting the food in your mouth</i>

02:45.081 --> 02:48.126
<i>when you couldn't wait</i>
<i>till after you'd swallowed to kiss </i>me.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.796
<i>Didn't think you were one for pretty boys.</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:54.924
<i>Could you really be</i>
<i>into all those muscles?</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:56.718
<i>Who is this monster?</i>

02:56.801 --> 02:57.886
That...

02:59.304 --> 03:00.471
is Milo.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.267
It's not really my business.

03:04.934 --> 03:09.230
-<i> Milo. Milo what?</i>
-Milo fucking Warrington.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.735
You know,
he used to be James's best friend.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.030
Love's late husband James?

03:17.155 --> 03:17.989
Exactly.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.701
He just spent two years traversing Asia

03:21.784 --> 03:25.246
so he could sprinkle James's ashes
all over the Himalayas.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.540
And now he's back,

03:28.124 --> 03:31.294
traversing Love's vagina. Again.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.504
'Cause he does that periodically.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.798
-<i> So he's a...</i>
-Scumbag.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.509
I would <i>Poltergeist</i> the shit out of him
if I was James.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.386
<i> I need answers, Love.</i>

03:40.470 --> 03:41.930
Well, maybe it's a comfort thing.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.474
I mean, they've both been
through something terrible.

03:45.141 --> 03:45.975
Yeah.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.228
Maybe for her, it is.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.939
But he's been sweet on her since college.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.274
He could not stand it
when she chose James.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.069
And then guess who was Mr. Attentive
at the funeral?

03:57.445 --> 03:59.572
Yeah. He stayed for weeks after.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.950
Cooked, cleaned, bathed her,

04:02.617 --> 04:04.410
went down on her every night.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.205
Nobody does that shit out
of the kindness of their own heart, Joe.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.665
He was preying on her

04:08.748 --> 04:10.291
when she was vulnerable.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.335
And now he's doing it again.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.088
Picking up the pieces
when your body's barely cold.

04:15.171 --> 04:18.800
<i> He's a predator,</i>
<i>and you're falling for it, Love.</i>

04:18.883 --> 04:21.719
Don't worry, sport,
she's not falling for it.

04:22.178 --> 04:25.223
Love will give herself permission to do
what she needs to do to heal,

04:25.306 --> 04:27.934
but she is still very broken up over you.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.019
She does not look very broken up.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.522
Challenge accepted.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.774
Watch this.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.656
<i> Milo Warrington,</i>

04:41.990 --> 04:45.201

<i>And you look too enchanted, Love.</i>

05:10.852 --> 05:11.853
What's up?

05:11.936 --> 05:15.815
Really? Bringing Mr. Didgeridon't
around just for Joe to see?

05:15.898 --> 05:18.192
It's all a little Dottie of you.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.111
You cannot possibly be into him.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.239
Okay, first of all, never compare me
to Mom again.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.284
And secondly, I'm actually into him.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.619
No, this is good for me.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.331
And I don't need you coming in
on behalf of Will,

05:31.414 --> 05:34.250
or... Joe,
or whatever the fuck his name is,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.836
trying to make me feel
some type of way about it, okay?

05:37.462 --> 05:40.006
Milo is good. At least he's honest.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.299
Is he, though?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.678
Do me a favor.
Focus on your own shit, okay?

05:45.762 --> 05:48.723
Move to the light, as Dottie would say.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.565
-Hey, Forty.
-Hi, Salami Nips.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.283
As I suspected, she is not over you.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.827
-Did she say that?
-She did not need to.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.871
This is what Love does when she's hurting.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.415
She, like, gets a little basic

06:14.499 --> 06:17.251
and pretends to like things
that she definitely does not like

06:17.335 --> 06:18.711
in order to seem normal.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.173
And also, it's the only time
that she'll snap at me. It's a tell.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.508
<i> Makes sense.</i>

06:23.591 --> 06:26.719
<i>When I was getting over Beck,</i>
<i>I glommed onto Karen Minty.</i>

06:26.803 --> 06:28.429
<i>Good, but wrong for me.</i>

06:28.930 --> 06:31.140
<i>Is that who Milo is? Is he your Karen?</i>

06:31.224 --> 06:34.018
Okay, so you know
what you have to do now, right?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.605
Get back on the horse,
start dating around,

06:37.688 --> 06:41.192
show Love how free
and happy you're living.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.568
She will hate that.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.362
I'm not the vindictive type.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.615
And she's not really the jealous type.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.701
Oh! I'm sorry,
did the two of you share a womb?

06:51.786 --> 06:54.956
Yeah, trust me, okay? She gets jealous.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.332
Now let's set you up.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.671
Forty.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.383
Why are you helping me?
I lied to your sister.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.300
I lied to you.

07:06.968 --> 07:11.013
I tangled you up in this--
this Amy-Candace mess.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.350
Hey. As Shakespeare once said,

07:15.017 --> 07:17.145
"Bitcheth was crazy."

07:17.228 --> 07:19.564
You lied out of necessity. Okay?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.650
That guy is a pie-hunting snake

07:22.733 --> 07:25.236
in Tarzan's body,
and I do not trust him.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.321
My gut says you're good,

07:27.405 --> 07:29.740
he's bad, case dismissed.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.955
<i> I'm starting to see what you see</i>
<i>in Forty. He is smart.</i>

07:36.038 --> 07:38.916
<i>And he loves you hard. I get that.</i>

07:39.000 --> 07:41.669
All right. I need something good
for your Flingr profile.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.504
Spit me some literature, please.

07:43.921 --> 07:44.922
Flingr?

07:45.506 --> 07:48.217
You are not putting this poor,
innocent man on there.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.635
I suggest Magnolia.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.304
It's mostly queer,

07:51.387 --> 07:53.264
but straight girls troll
for gays to beard,

07:53.347 --> 07:55.099
-and they are aggressive as fuck.
-Oh.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.894
I know it's a deeper conversation,
but I'm just saying,

07:57.977 --> 08:01.314
-I could have all the pussy I could...
-Eat.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.775
Eat... or whatever.
So, by all means, you take it.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.694
Goldleaf is another good one.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.238
It's only for celebrities,
so we would need to get you verified,

08:09.322 --> 08:11.866
but, uh, it's safer for people like us.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.534
You up on the lingo?

08:13.993 --> 08:15.369
"PnP," whatnot?

08:17.455 --> 08:19.874
"Party and play," a.k.a. drugs and sex?

08:19.957 --> 08:22.919
Oh! If someone hits you
with a "What's up," capital T,

08:23.002 --> 08:24.754
that means "Tina," which means meth.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.423
-Why is Tina meth?
-Oh, and you definitely need to watch

08:27.507 --> 08:28.758
for kitten-fishing thirst traps.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.052
-What?
-Pictures.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.221
Like, if it's a close-up head shot,
she's fat.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.640
If it's a group shot, she's, like,
really insecure,

08:35.723 --> 08:38.184
but, like, wants to seem fun.
And if she has a pixie cut...

08:40.520 --> 08:41.979
-Oh, and...
-Okay.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.650
Thank you both. Wow.
That's a lot to think about.

08:46.150 --> 08:46.984
And I will.

08:49.904 --> 08:50.905
Thoughts?

08:51.697 --> 08:52.740
Chum in the water.

08:57.787 --> 09:02.333
<i> You know, I gotta hand it to this</i>
<i> guy, he takes a gorgeous picture.</i>

09:02.416 --> 09:03.793
<i>Not that it's difficult</i>

09:04.085 --> 09:06.420
<i>when the subject is you.</i>

09:06.754 --> 09:10.258
<i> Uh, what was that?</i>
<i>No. Did I just like his photo of you?</i>

09:10.341 --> 09:11.634
<i>-Son of a--</i>
-Hey, creep.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.761
-Hey.
-Do me a favor.

09:13.844 --> 09:17.098
Instead of Delilah,
fuck anything else. Cool?

09:17.181 --> 09:19.392
How-- Why do you know about that?

09:19.475 --> 09:20.810
Just be a normal person

09:20.893 --> 09:23.396
and rebound on Flingr
instead of your literal neighbor.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.023
-Can you do that?
- Elle?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.195
Can you scrounge up some more quarters?
We need three more.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.113
Fine.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.284
But if I come back
and witness anything nasty,

09:37.201 --> 09:38.578
I'm running away forever.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.126
-Hi.
-Apartment three.

09:45.710 --> 09:49.547
-Delilah, I'm sorry, I--
-Stop, it's no big deal. Okay?

09:49.964 --> 09:51.424
You can stop avoiding me

09:51.507 --> 09:53.801
and pay your fucking rent
because it's late.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.637
-That's right. I'm sorry.
-And stop apologizing.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.682
Okay.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.727
But, hey, Flingr is a great idea

10:02.810 --> 10:07.148
because you clearly need some training
on how to be a single human man in LA.

-but, I don't...
-I don't <i>hate</i> him.

10:38.512 --> 10:42.141
Ever think maybe it's because I like him,
I don't want things to blow up?

10:42.224 --> 10:43.684
Which you know will happen.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.146

12:42.261 --> 12:43.637
Bit of a romantic.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.139
What's your story?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.767
-I moved here a few months ago.
-For the industry?

12:48.058 --> 12:49.143
Me too!

12:49.226 --> 12:51.520
From where? What are your goals?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.606
Any fetishes I should know about?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.649
"But you can't get away from yourself,

12:55.733 --> 12:57.902
moving from one place to another."

12:58.402 --> 13:01.405
That's...<i> The Sun Also Rises.</i>

13:01.989 --> 13:03.324
You know your Hemingway.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.159
It's very sexy.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.660
I couldn't agree more.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.710
Uh, cheers.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.378
Higher.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.214
It's in portrait mode, right?

13:24.011 --> 13:26.096
I'll get the room. You walk in two steps,

13:26.180 --> 13:28.557
get on your knees, we fuck,
you leave, no talking.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.102
-Um...
-"If you think it long...

13:33.020 --> 13:34.355
and mad..."

13:35.397 --> 13:37.399
Take some on your phone.
Your camera might be better.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.409
"I shall lift my arms,

13:47.535 --> 13:50.788
and my roots shall set off
to seek another land."

13:58.128 --> 13:59.588
Let's get you an Uber home.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.141
<i> Thanks to Forty's constant reposts</i>

14:11.225 --> 14:14.562
<i>to his Stories, I can see you've been</i>
<i>looking at my profile, Love,</i>

14:14.645 --> 14:17.439
<i>but choosing not to engage.</i>

14:17.523 --> 14:20.568
<i>Now that's a sign, right? You're jealous.</i>

14:23.737 --> 14:25.030
Oh, my God.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.700
-You went all the way to Glendora?
-Yeah, of course.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.247
<i> Meanwhile, Milo's account</i>
<i>is getting more and more intimate.</i>

14:36.166 --> 14:39.587
<i>And now you're eating sex crime donuts</i>
<i>with him and not me.</i>

14:41.881 --> 14:43.132
-Hey, Will.
-Hey.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.427
-What are you doing?
-I'm-- I'm just reorganizing. Per Forty.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.428
Is that the garbage?

14:47.511 --> 14:49.305
-Yeah.
-Oh. I got it.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.265
-You sure?
-Yeah. I'm already back here.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.100
Okay, thanks.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.436
What did you want to talk to me about?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.647
Well, as you know, I go to Bali next week,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.524
and I should be there
for about ten months.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.569
Mm-hmm?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.362
Yeah, you said you were really excited.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.197
<i> This is the moment he asks</i>
<i>you to come.</i>

15:07.281 --> 15:09.033
<i>He's trying to Peach you,</i>

15:09.116 --> 15:11.368
<i>-and I have the pleasure of hearing it.</i>
- Well,

15:12.202 --> 15:13.245
not anymore.

15:13.954 --> 15:17.082
I'm tired of traveling.
And this,

15:17.166 --> 15:19.543
you and me,
has been really good, hasn't it?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.378
-<i> Oh, no.</i>
-Yeah, it's great.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.256
Right. So, I'm thinking,

15:25.007 --> 15:26.467
what if I stick around a while?

15:26.550 --> 15:29.511
What if you and me give this a real shot?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.724
I want you to be my girlfriend, Love.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.144
I'm sorry...

15:38.520 --> 15:39.688
Just a little dry.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.190
Wow.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.192
Milo, that's, um...

15:45.319 --> 15:47.655
I don't want you to make that decision
because of me.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.367
But if staying in LA feels right, then...

15:52.034 --> 15:52.910
you should.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.621
Okay.

16:06.090 --> 16:11.178
<i> So, the big guy is sticking around</i>
<i>like a stupid fucking boomerang.</i>

16:11.261 --> 16:13.263
<i>Do you want to be his girlfriend, Love?</i>

16:13.347 --> 16:15.808
Enjoy. I hear the beaches
in Manila are beautiful.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.814
Hey.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.483
Hey.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.070
I heard you're... online dating.

16:29.863 --> 16:30.990
Forty told me twice

16:31.073 --> 16:33.117
-or, like, 100 times.
-Yeah.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.661
-He's very supportive, I guess.
-It's going well?

16:36.662 --> 16:38.080
<i> You </i>are <i>curious.</i>

16:38.163 --> 16:40.249
It is, actually. Yeah, I mean, it's all--

16:40.332 --> 16:41.500
That's really great.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.919
I'm glad
you're putting yourself out there.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.089
I was just also curious.
What name are you using? Will or Joe?

16:47.673 --> 16:48.590
Love.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.094
Will.

16:52.928 --> 16:53.846
Interesting.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.105
<i> Forty was wrong.</i>

17:03.188 --> 17:06.608
<i>You aren't jealous. You are disgusted.</i>

17:07.026 --> 17:08.068
<i>And I don't blame you.</i>

17:08.152 --> 17:10.612
<i>While I've been on a fool's errand</i>
<i>of pointless dates,</i>

17:10.696 --> 17:14.408
<i>Milo has leveled up,</i>
<i>and you are falling for it.</i>

17:15.284 --> 17:18.162
<i>I think I've been putting my attention</i>
<i>in the wrong place.</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:21.749
<i>Is it the Avengers</i> <i>bod?</i>

17:21.832 --> 17:25.169
<i>Or the "born into old money</i>
<i>but went the New-Age route" thing?</i>

17:25.252 --> 17:28.088
<i>Oh, is it the sex?</i>

17:28.172 --> 17:30.966
<i>Damn. This is really uphill.</i>

17:31.467 --> 17:33.594
<i>Is it his lung capacity, Love?</i>

17:40.267 --> 17:42.311
- Will?
-<i> Shit.</i>

17:42.394 --> 17:44.104
<i>Of course, your best friend, now.</i>

17:44.188 --> 17:46.023
Gabe! Man, what--

17:46.815 --> 17:50.360
That's crazy. I just saw, um, Milo.
He, you know, he's--

17:50.444 --> 17:53.280
It's a coincidence. I guess he's hiking.
Everybody's hiking today.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.616
-You hike often?
-Uh...

17:56.742 --> 17:58.077
I'm getting into it, yeah.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.954
Will, I have
an especially potent bullshit detector.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.374
You mind if we just sidestep
these forced niceties?

18:04.958 --> 18:07.169
-Stop the little white lies.

18:07.294 --> 18:11.507
Love values radical,
it-hurts-even-to-say-it honesty

18:11.590 --> 18:13.008
above anything else.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.969
And she caught you in a fucking whopper.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.638
I know.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.724
-I know--
-That being said,

18:21.600 --> 18:23.102
in almost ten years of our friendship,

18:23.185 --> 18:24.978
I don't think she has ever talked
about someone

18:25.062 --> 18:26.730
the way that she has talked about you.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.273
Not even James.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.109
So I think there's still hope.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.195
But this whole Flingr-whore,
jealous stalker thing,

18:33.278 --> 18:34.947
it is not a good look.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.950
You wanna know
why Love is so attracted to Milo?

18:38.033 --> 18:39.910
-<i> Yes.</i>
-He worked on himself.

18:39.993 --> 18:43.622
Damage attracts damage.
Healthy people like healthy people.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.208
-What if I'm damaged?
-Honey...

18:48.085 --> 18:50.754
everybody came here because they are.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.841
The point is what you do with it.

18:53.924 --> 18:58.512
Maybe it's time you faced this
like a true Angeleno, hmm?

18:59.596 --> 19:01.932
<i> Terrified to know what this means.</i>

19:02.015 --> 19:03.100
Come along.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.572
How are you feeling?

19:17.030 --> 19:17.906
<i> Crazy.</i>

19:17.990 --> 19:19.116
Nervous.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.701
What are you afraid of?

19:20.993 --> 19:24.246
<i> That one of these will graze a</i>
<i>nerve, and I'll become Sloth from </i>Goonies.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.497
Um...

19:25.789 --> 19:26.832
I don't know.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.294
Ow.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.879
What are you afraid of?

19:36.884 --> 19:39.970
I don't know, I'm afraid this won't work.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.015
That is what you thought I wanted to hear.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.101
What are you afraid of?

19:46.727 --> 19:48.103
<i> Okay. Breathe.</i>

19:48.562 --> 19:52.149
<i>Think. Answer honestly</i>
<i>because your psycho friend Gabe</i>

19:52.232 --> 19:53.859
<i>is a human lie detector.</i>

19:53.942 --> 19:55.110
I'm afraid...

19:55.986 --> 19:57.571
this will work.

19:57.654 --> 19:58.655
And?

19:59.156 --> 20:01.742
I'll say something... true.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.661
Something bad.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.373
You'll tell Love.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.003
And I'll lose her forever.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.964
<i> What is in these needles?</i>

20:16.340 --> 20:18.383
The truth does not scare Love.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.844
This would.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.846
<i> Love, your friend is a sorcerer.</i>

20:22.930 --> 20:24.932
So, you believe your truth...

20:25.974 --> 20:28.310
makes you unworthy of love?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.729
<i> I need to stop talking now.</i>

20:30.854 --> 20:31.897
Yes.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.775
And, therefore, unworthy of Love.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.281
Yes.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.536
-<i> Mommy?</i>
-<i> Joe.</i>

20:46.620 --> 20:47.788
<i>Baby.</i>

20:48.455 --> 20:51.124
<i>-Get in here.</i>
-<i> I was afraid you left.</i>

20:52.501 --> 20:53.669
<i> I'm so sorry.</i>

20:54.294 --> 20:55.254
What's happening?

20:55.337 --> 20:57.005
<i> My home is you.</i>

20:57.089 --> 20:59.216
Who would you be
if you didn't have anyone to love?

20:59.299 --> 21:01.260
<i> Joey, you're such a good boy.</i>

21:01.343 --> 21:02.928
What did you lose...

21:04.680 --> 21:07.140
that makes you chase love so much?

21:11.895 --> 21:12.980
Today's the day.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.898
We're getting out of here.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.275
Where are we going?

21:16.358 --> 21:17.567
I don't know yet.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.822
But we're never gonna see him again. Okay?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.741
I'm sorry I did this to you.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.581
I thought he'd be better this time,

21:32.165 --> 21:33.250
but he was worse.

21:33.875 --> 21:34.960
We're done.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.087
We're out.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.755
-What are we?
-Out.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.091
That's right. Pack your stuff.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.261
Take only the important things,
none of those books.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.762
You hear me?

21:46.346 --> 21:48.265
Okay, you can take one.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.731
I'm gonna go to the bank,
and I'll be back at four to get you.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.775
And it'll be just the two of us.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.072
As long as we're together,

22:05.198 --> 22:06.366
we'll always be home.

22:21.715 --> 22:26.053
You have been in the pursuit of someone
to love and care for for all of your life.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.262
What if...

22:27.346 --> 22:29.139
-you were that person?

22:31.850 --> 22:33.560
What if you're all that you need?

22:33.643 --> 22:35.103
Say it with me, "I...

22:35.187 --> 22:36.688
-I...
-...am all I need."

22:36.772 --> 22:37.856
...am all I need.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.191
Again.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.486
I am all I need.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.711
How are you feeling?

23:01.129 --> 23:02.047
Free.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.552
Full.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.349
-It's the power of self-love.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.685
As Mama Ru says,

23:17.104 --> 23:18.814
"If you cannot love yourself,

23:20.148 --> 23:22.359
how in the hell
are you gonna love somebody else?"

23:23.985 --> 23:24.861
Hm.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.032
Okay, easy.

23:29.950 --> 23:33.912
Easy now. You're gonna feel
a little out-of-body for a while.

23:35.080 --> 23:35.997
All right?

23:37.999 --> 23:39.501
You're a wizard.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.379
Thank you.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.841
But this is not a cure-all.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.509
It's a practice.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.847
You're still gonna experience
dark thoughts and emotions.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.975
What is important
is that you follow it up with,

23:56.017 --> 23:57.269
"And I'm okay with that."

23:59.020 --> 24:00.480
"I'm okay with that."

24:02.232 --> 24:04.192
Good.  Good, good.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.529
It's also important
you keep that temple clean, okay?

24:07.612 --> 24:10.073
I'm gonna suggest
a quick seven-day cleanse.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.709
Eew!

24:21.084 --> 24:25.338
Dude, I love green juice,
but celery is basically Satan's butt plug.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.631
It's not that bad.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.009
Oh, I can't look at you
while you drink that.

24:29.509 --> 24:32.012
But we do need to chat, re: D-FOL.

24:32.095 --> 24:35.182
We gotta find a big name to play Beck.
Or maybe...

24:35.807 --> 24:39.269
we take the auditions on the road.
Like, look for our Scarlett O'Hara.

24:39.352 --> 24:40.896
Do you have any thoughts?

24:40.979 --> 24:44.441
<i> It's kind of nice how Forty</i>
<i>sabotages his own process so much.</i>

24:44.524 --> 24:46.026
<i>It takes it out of my hands entirely.</i>

24:46.109 --> 24:48.695
-Shouldn't we write a script first?

24:48.862 --> 24:49.946
What you writing?

24:52.032 --> 24:53.742
Ellie, what are you doing here?

24:54.159 --> 24:56.536
Checking in to see
how the dating world's treating you.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.704
Being neighborly.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.206
<i> I don't buy it.</i>

25:00.832 --> 25:01.875
Celery juice?

25:03.043 --> 25:04.544
Ugh, what is wrong with you?

25:04.628 --> 25:06.254
This kid knows what's up.

25:06.755 --> 25:10.091
He's on a juice cleanse,
trying to fix himself, win back my sister.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.843
Flingr was a bust, huh?

25:12.719 --> 25:15.180
The kid is Ellie Alves, by the way.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.975
Read in the trades you acquired
a pretty big piece of IP, Forty Quinn.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.018
Trades?

25:20.268 --> 25:22.270
Yeah,
I had my agent put out a press release.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.189
<i> Shit. Fuck. Damn it, Forty.</i>

25:24.272 --> 25:27.526
If you need any help with development,
I'm really good with coverage and notes.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.695
<i> And there's the real reason</i>
<i>she's here. Little opportunist.</i>

25:30.779 --> 25:32.822
-What are you, 12?
-I'm almost 16,

25:33.114 --> 25:35.158
and I can guarantee you
I know more about film

25:35.242 --> 25:37.285
than any idiot assistant
to come out of WME.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.538
-<i> Oh, here we go.</i>
-All right, Hermione,

25:39.621 --> 25:41.581
who was originally supposed to play
the Terminator?

25:41.665 --> 25:45.126
OJ Simpson, but James Cameron thought
he looked too nice to play a killer.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.587
What's the longest narrative film shoot
in history?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.297
<i>-Boyhood, </i>12 years.
-Not even close.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.715
<i>The Thief and the Cobbler, </i>29 years.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.093
-Doesn't count. It's not live-action.
-Not what I asked.

25:54.678 --> 25:55.512
Okay.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.597
-Okay.

25:58.306 --> 26:01.101
What say you, sport?
Should we hire ourselves an intern?

26:01.184 --> 26:03.728
<i> Well, Forty's no Henderson.</i>

26:03.812 --> 26:06.273
<i>And Little Miss Ballsy</i>
<i>is bound to find opportunity elsewhere.</i>

26:06.356 --> 26:08.858
<i>Probably with less honorable people.</i>

26:08.942 --> 26:10.360
<i>The devil you know, right?</i>

26:10.443 --> 26:11.278
Fine.

26:11.611 --> 26:12.571
After homework,

26:12.654 --> 26:15.740
limited hours,
only with Delilah's written permission.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.410
-Okay, Dad.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.968
<i> Beautiful and artful,</i>
<i>though a bit of a violation.</i>

26:35.051 --> 26:37.304
<i>Because I know</i>
<i>you would've never consented to this.</i>

26:37.387 --> 26:39.055
<i>Uh, not my business.</i>

26:39.139 --> 26:41.349
<i>If you want to be with someone</i>
<i>who posts intimate pictures</i>

26:41.433 --> 26:45.103
<i>without your knowledge for millions</i>
<i>to enjoy, it's your choice, Love. </i>

26:45.186 --> 26:46.688
<i>And I'm okay with that.</i>

26:52.777 --> 26:53.820
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:53.903 --> 26:59.034
So, remember how you mansplained to me
that I should write my Henderson story?

26:59.117 --> 27:00.243
Vividly.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.995
<i> Am I sweating? Why am I sweating?</i>

27:02.078 --> 27:03.622
Well, I'm not saying I did it,

27:04.080 --> 27:07.000
but if I had written it and submitted it,

27:07.626 --> 27:10.795
I might have gotten confirmation
that it's gonna be published

27:10.879 --> 27:12.964
in <i>Variety </i>fucking magazine.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.550
Holy shit, Delilah! That's so great.

27:15.675 --> 27:18.053
Let's be clear, though,
this is not a thank-you.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.097
I will never thank you. Clear?

27:21.181 --> 27:23.141
-So--
-<i> What is happening here?</i>

27:23.224 --> 27:24.225
Yeah. So clear.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.478
What is happening here? Are you--

27:31.983 --> 27:32.817
Oh, my God.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.491
Oh, my God. That is so good.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.618
Mmm.

27:41.868 --> 27:46.164
It's Meyer lemon and plum curd
and Italian buttercream.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.832
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.668
My favorite so far.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.419
You've said that
about all of them.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.630
And I meant it every time.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.008
Sunrise and Lucy will be stoked
with any of these, babe.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.302
You're...

27:59.928 --> 28:00.970
incredible.

28:01.888 --> 28:02.889
Thanks.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.393
But if you call me "babe" again,
I'm gonna stick you in the oven.

28:14.859 --> 28:15.819
So...

28:17.153 --> 28:18.780
I found a place.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.157
Little bungalow in Atwater.

28:21.241 --> 28:25.120
Close enough I can jog to you,
but not so close it's clingy.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.080
-What about--
-I canceled Bali.

28:28.081 --> 28:31.209
You said if it felt right for me to stay,
then I should.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.795
And... this feels right.

28:34.462 --> 28:35.630
I want to see where this goes.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.424
Milo, I care about you a lot.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.634
And this has been great.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.010
I just...

28:41.886 --> 28:43.972
I like the way things are.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.560
I'm not sure
I'm ready to change the dynamic.

28:48.643 --> 28:52.188
The dynamic where you call me
when you need to get over another guy?

28:53.606 --> 28:55.692
Yes. But it's not just that.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.448
You, more than anyone,
know that I am a package deal.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.284
Forty...

29:05.076 --> 29:06.119
he needs me.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.872
He's working on this film, which,
quite frankly, is bound to fail

29:08.955 --> 29:09.956
because they all do.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.000
And when he does, he'll implode.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.126
I can <i>feel</i> it.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.503
It's just like the earthquake.
We all know the big one is coming.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.506
-He's a grown man, Love.
<i>-</i>But he's not, really.

29:19.299 --> 29:23.219
One thing I love is your honesty.

29:23.803 --> 29:26.931
Maybe it's time to get honest
with how codependent you are with him.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.434
Hey, look.

29:32.645 --> 29:35.273
I'm... falling in love with you.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.735
And it's okay if you're not there yet.

29:39.402 --> 29:40.403
I can wait.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.572
Just... let me.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.283
Please.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.211
Will? Will, wake up.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.295
Oh!

30:00.006 --> 30:00.924
What happened?

30:01.883 --> 30:04.636
You <i>Exorcist-</i>vomited
all over my favorite top

30:04.719 --> 30:06.262
and then passed out.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.932
Oh.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.976
Same thing happened to me
a couple years ago

30:12.060 --> 30:14.521
when I read that celery
was negative calories.

30:15.021 --> 30:16.314
I ate nothing else for three days

30:16.397 --> 30:19.025
and then projectile barfed
all over my own birthday cake.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.446
-Oh.
-Enough of this juice shit.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.616
I'm ordering burgers and shakes.

30:34.749 --> 30:35.625
So?

30:42.006 --> 30:43.216
Ugh.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.634
It's hard to read.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.053
But I still couldn't put it down.

30:49.472 --> 30:50.598
It's incredible.

30:51.599 --> 30:54.227
Well, don't sound so <i>surprised.</i>

30:55.103 --> 30:58.481
It's weird
how powerful vulnerability can feel.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.651
I don't think I would've had the guts
if you hadn't angered me into it.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.653
Still not a thank-you.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.114
You know you can always count on me
to say the wrong thing.

31:07.156 --> 31:10.660
If I told you I was proud,
would you want to hurt me?

31:10.743 --> 31:12.412
-Probably.
-Okay.

31:12.495 --> 31:13.621
-Yeah.
-Well.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.332
I'm definitely not proud of you.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.753
So... did you really think you
were gonna juice your way

31:20.837 --> 31:22.589
back into Love Quinn's heart?

31:23.381 --> 31:24.257
Wasn't about her.

31:25.675 --> 31:26.718
Not really.

31:26.801 --> 31:28.761
What? You trying to reach
your goal weight?

31:29.345 --> 31:30.805
Just want to clear the noise.

31:31.890 --> 31:32.765
Did it work?

31:34.309 --> 31:35.184
I don't know.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.937
Maybe I'm cynical, but I...

31:39.105 --> 31:43.651
really don't think any of that stuff works
for anyone who's truly broken.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.862
Serves us better
to just keep barreling forward

31:45.945 --> 31:47.530
and hope the demons can't keep up.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.324
So...

31:49.908 --> 31:51.409
might as well be who you are.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.537
This is not outrunning demons.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.206
This is slaying them.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.709
-No thanks to you.
-Zero thanks to me.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.671
<i> Nice to meet the real you, Delilah.</i>

32:03.755 --> 32:05.131
<i>You're really quite beautiful.</i>

32:05.214 --> 32:06.174
<i>Oh, no.</i>

32:07.300 --> 32:08.426
This is good.

32:10.011 --> 32:12.138
Everything's better with a little whiskey.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.307
In fact,

32:15.099 --> 32:16.976
this night could do
with a little bit more.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.019
You up for a walk?

32:21.314 --> 32:24.400
My first impression of you was...

32:25.151 --> 32:26.527
weirdo.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.364
Oh, come on, you can't be surprised.

32:29.447 --> 32:32.200
- You had no social media.
- Oh!

32:32.325 --> 32:35.787
You show up with a backpack, all New York.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.415
Most people show up
like overeager labradoodles.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.292
I couldn't pull shit out of you.

32:41.709 --> 32:46.089
Almost like you were purposely trying
to have no personality whatsoever.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.925
- Ow!

32:49.050 --> 32:50.176
<i>In vino veritas.</i>

32:50.259 --> 32:51.636
Hey, you asked for it.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.014
Okay, my turn.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.976
What was your first impression of me?

32:58.518 --> 33:00.395
Be honest.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.897
-<i> Definitely do not be honest.</i>
-I thought you seemed nice.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.318
Okay, you're such a liar.

33:07.402 --> 33:11.781
Why don't you wash your mouth out,
try again. Veritas.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.828
<i> Oh, well, here goes.</i>

33:18.121 --> 33:19.539
I thought you seemed sad.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.377
I could see how much you had
on your shoulders.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.254
It's a lot.

33:27.463 --> 33:30.049
Also, I have this bad habit
of trying to fix people.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.845
Thus, the unfriendly New Yorker.
So I'm sorry about that.

33:33.928 --> 33:34.804
Hey...

33:36.347 --> 33:37.640
Stop apologizing.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.354
You still think I'm a weirdo?

33:45.690 --> 33:48.484
I mean, I always trust first impressions.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.279
Thing is,

33:52.113 --> 33:53.239
I like weirdos.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.703
Damaged finds damaged.

34:00.913 --> 34:01.914
Every time.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.188
<i> Fuck me.</i>

34:33.446 --> 34:35.364
David Fincher.

34:35.948 --> 34:37.658
Come on. He's a personal friend.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.285
Can we just get him in here,

34:39.619 --> 34:42.121
so we don't have to do
the whole phone call thing?

34:42.997 --> 34:44.373
No? Okay.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.087
<i> What if they take fingerprints?</i>
<i>What if they take DNA?</i>

34:49.170 --> 34:52.924
<i>Not like there's a crusty jar of piss</i>
<i>in Peach Salinger's house or anything.</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:55.927
Guard's playing deaf and dumb.
It was worth a try, though.

34:57.011 --> 34:58.054
What a night, huh?

34:58.137 --> 35:00.264
How long do you think they'll keep us
in here?

35:00.348 --> 35:02.892
I don't know.
I think it's like a six-hour hold.

35:02.975 --> 35:04.727
And then they take our fingerprints
and shit.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.104
<i> Shit, shit, shit.</i>

35:08.439 --> 35:09.524
Are you okay?

35:09.607 --> 35:12.110
-I just...
-<i> Benji, Peach, Beck, Jasper, Hendy.</i>

35:12.193 --> 35:13.736
...don't like confined spaces.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.154
Okay. Well, don't worry.

35:15.863 --> 35:16.781
I got this.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.158
Is this really your first time
being arrested?

35:19.242 --> 35:20.743
-Is it not yours?

35:21.994 --> 35:23.246
- Delilah.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.790
Fincher, thank God!

35:25.873 --> 35:27.208
<i> Really?</i>

35:27.291 --> 35:29.710
Can you get us out of here?
It was just a big misunderstanding.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.754
We were barely tipsy.
We weren't even driving--

35:31.838 --> 35:33.798
I heard why they brought you in.

35:33.881 --> 35:34.841
That doesn't sound

35:34.924 --> 35:36.592
-like a misunderstanding to me.
-Finch.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.805
You need a lawyer.

35:42.056 --> 35:43.516
I'm sorry, but, uh...

35:44.642 --> 35:45.601
I can't help you.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.987
Will, you know anybody with pull
who isn't a jealous fuck?

35:59.448 --> 36:01.951
It's no problem, sport.
I have a guy for these things.

36:02.034 --> 36:04.579
Just sit tight. Oh, and, hey...

36:05.163 --> 36:06.789
I'm so proud of you.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.962
Oh, my God. In an alley.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.340
Bettelheim. Alves.
You're next for processing.

36:16.924 --> 36:17.842
Fab.

36:17.925 --> 36:19.427
<i> Mexico's only a few hours away.</i>

36:19.510 --> 36:22.096
<i>I could start there.</i>
<i>Will did say I'd like it. Then go south.</i>

36:22.180 --> 36:23.306
<i>Keep going.</i>

36:26.017 --> 36:27.185
There you go.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.228
All right, let's go, D.

36:30.855 --> 36:34.108
You and your friend are free to go.

36:38.112 --> 36:40.865
Apparently,
you have some pretty powerful friends,

36:40.948 --> 36:42.158
William Bettelheim.

36:42.825 --> 36:44.619
Thank you, Officer.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.371
Wait, I know you.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.372
Yeah, he's my neighbor.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.291
You've probably seen him
around the building.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.210
Thanks for your help.

37:04.972 --> 37:05.890
Is that it?

37:05.973 --> 37:08.517
If not, I know where to find you.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.068
Well, the sun's already up.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.070
It's beautiful.

37:21.614 --> 37:22.990
I actually have to get to work,

37:24.200 --> 37:25.326
but thank you

37:25.701 --> 37:28.704
for a night I will not soon forget.

37:30.873 --> 37:33.000
Yeah, that was fun.

37:33.584 --> 37:37.421
Should probs stick to friendship
from now on, though.

37:39.048 --> 37:40.091
For Ellie.

37:41.884 --> 37:42.802
Friends?

37:46.138 --> 37:47.431
You're such an idiot.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.733
Are you guys fucking kidding me?

37:58.526 --> 37:59.485
Elle, I--

37:59.568 --> 38:01.570
You left me alone all night
so you could get laid?

38:02.655 --> 38:04.657
Why do you have to be such a slut?

38:10.037 --> 38:11.080
Friends.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.715
Indecent exposure.

38:20.798 --> 38:23.968
It's a really good title for something.
It kind of rolls off the tongue.

38:24.051 --> 38:26.178
Indecent exposure.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.388
I'm not telling you anything.

38:27.471 --> 38:30.016
How lewd... conduct.

38:32.977 --> 38:33.811
Hey, gents.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.689
Salami.

38:36.772 --> 38:39.150
<i> You don't like surprises.</i>
<i>And you hate roses.</i>

38:41.819 --> 38:43.195
She hates roses.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.905
It's like he's not even trying,

38:44.989 --> 38:47.283
and yet, somehow he still tries too hard.

38:52.246 --> 38:54.123
-Later, fellas.
-Bye, Vagemite.

38:54.206 --> 38:55.750
Oh, hey,

38:56.334 --> 38:58.336
really looking forward
to your next failed attempt

38:58.419 --> 38:59.837
to lock down my sister.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.672
I'm loving the enthusiasm.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.049
<i> Don't do it.</i>

39:04.216 --> 39:05.176
Forty...

39:06.093 --> 39:08.804
I know it's not easy for you
when Love's attention's on someone else.

39:08.888 --> 39:12.350
But I'm gonna be around,
so it'd be nice if we could be cordial

39:12.433 --> 39:13.768
like adults.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.394
Your sister and I are happy.

39:15.478 --> 39:18.105
And it'd nice if you could be happy
for her, too. Huh, champ?

39:19.273 --> 39:20.358
<i> Shit.</i>

39:22.526 --> 39:24.987
Interesting. See, the way that I see it,

39:26.030 --> 39:28.532
you're not gonna be around long, at all.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.910
'Cause you're a Neanderthal.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.912
Wow, when are you gonna grow up?

39:32.995 --> 39:36.707
When are you gonna realize that
natural deodorant is not working for you?

39:36.791 --> 39:37.792
Guys, let’s take it down.

39:37.875 --> 39:38.793
What’s going on?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.419
You're the reason why Love
can’t do anything good with her life.

39:40.503 --> 39:42.296
You’re a fucking albatross
around her neck.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.964
-Milo--
- I wonder what James,

39:44.048 --> 39:46.425
your best friend, is thinking,
sitting up in heaven,

39:46.509 --> 39:49.387
watching you fingerbang his wife
'cause you can’t keep your dick hard.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.388
-Hey!

39:50.471 --> 39:51.847
Oh, my God. Forty.

39:51.931 --> 39:52.890
That’s enough.

39:53.307 --> 39:54.225
Get the fuck out, Milo!

39:54.308 --> 39:55.226
He started it!

39:55.309 --> 39:56.560
-Oh, grow up!
-Me?

39:56.644 --> 39:58.479
I’ve been biting my tongue
for a long time.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.856
But maybe if you paid less attention
to your idiot brother,

40:00.940 --> 40:02.608
and more attention to what’s actually
in front of you,

40:02.691 --> 40:04.527
you might've noticed sooner
that James was sick.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.323
She said get out.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.492
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

40:12.493 --> 40:13.577
Be a big man?

40:13.661 --> 40:14.995
Hope she takes you back?

40:37.726 --> 40:38.561
What?

40:38.644 --> 40:40.771
<i>I remembered</i>
<i>where I knew your friend from.</i>

40:41.105 --> 40:42.982
Great. Bye.

40:43.065 --> 40:46.026
<i>Stopped him for jaywalking,</i>
<i>right outside your place.</i>

40:46.610 --> 40:48.404
Pulled some limited-edition headphones
off him.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.865
Really? You were that cop?

40:50.948 --> 40:52.450
<i>He was throwing them away, D.</i>

40:52.533 --> 40:54.785
William Bettelheim
drives a beater Honda Civic

40:54.869 --> 40:57.538
and makes $12 an hour working
at a grocery store.

40:57.621 --> 41:00.207
<i>Those headphones alone cost</i>
<i>more than he makes in a week.</i>

41:00.291 --> 41:03.294
You ran a background check, Finch?
What the hell is wrong with you?

41:03.377 --> 41:06.464
<i>Listen, Delilah, that was the same night</i>
<i>that Henderson was murdered.</i>

41:06.547 --> 41:09.383
What’s a guy with no real money,
no assets doing,

41:09.467 --> 41:11.760
getting rid of $600 headphones

41:11.844 --> 41:14.221
at 4:00 a.m.
the same night a celebrity was killed?

41:14.305 --> 41:15.473
<i>The same celebrity</i>

41:15.556 --> 41:17.808
<i>who is the spokesperson</i>
<i>for those fucking headphones?</i>

41:17.892 --> 41:20.519
Okay, just stop, Alex Jones.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.980
Look, I know you didn’t like seeing me
with another dude,

41:23.063 --> 41:25.399
<i>but this look is not cute.</i>

41:25.483 --> 41:26.775
If you wanna be exclusive,

41:26.859 --> 41:29.278
you can ask me out on a real date,
and then we’ll talk.

41:29.361 --> 41:31.280
<i>But I’m not entertaining your ego anymore.</i>
<i>Goodbye.</i>

41:31.363 --> 41:32.448
No, D.

41:47.963 --> 41:49.089
Doesn’t mean anything.

41:52.259 --> 41:54.053
<i> My skirt was pulled up.</i>

41:54.762 --> 41:56.347
So you’re saying Henderson--

41:56.430 --> 41:59.600
-Or, hey, maybe my skirt just rode up.
-How much did you pay Will to follow me?

41:59.683 --> 42:02.394
Just wanted to make sure you got
that envelope on your doorstep.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.606
-How did you know about that?
-This is quite a who's who.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.608
-Oh, look, I made the cut.
<i>-</i> <i>Apparently,</i>

42:07.691 --> 42:09.652
you have some pretty powerful friends,

42:09.735 --> 42:10.986
<i>William Bettelheim.</i>

42:22.122 --> 42:23.791
There’s no way.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.672
You see? Nothing.

43:31.025 --> 43:31.942
All right.

43:54.214 --> 43:55.132
Hey.

43:55.215 --> 43:59.011
That was the most disgusting display
of toxic masculinity.

43:59.094 --> 44:02.014
Okay, I don't need you, or you,
or anybody to defend me,

44:02.097 --> 44:04.224
or my honor, or whatever you think
makes you entitled

44:04.308 --> 44:06.018
-to do what you just did.
-Okay.

44:06.977 --> 44:10.814
Miss "Sic the PI on my Girlfriend
for My Protection,"

44:10.898 --> 44:14.860
retract the claws,
lest you scratch yourself with hypocrisy.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.700
Yeah. We’re all a bunch of assholes.

44:24.036 --> 44:26.288
Yeah, you’re right. It wasn’t our place.

44:28.499 --> 44:29.416
I’m sorry.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.168
I'm sorry too.

44:31.585 --> 44:35.547
We just...
We love you too much. Don’t we, sport?

44:37.841 --> 44:38.759
<i> Always.</i>

44:40.678 --> 44:42.680
I should get going. I have dinner plans.

44:43.514 --> 44:44.515
Another date?

44:45.891 --> 44:47.476
It's just dinner with a friend.

44:50.813 --> 44:51.897
Hey.

44:54.733 --> 44:55.859
You’re a good friend...

44:58.153 --> 44:59.029
Joe.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.407
<i> My name.</i>

45:01.490 --> 45:04.785
<i>My real name in your mouth is like poetry.</i>

45:05.035 --> 45:06.161
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

45:06.245 --> 45:08.163
<i>no matter how much self-work I do,</i>

45:08.247 --> 45:11.375
<i>a part of me will always miss the home</i>
<i>that is you.</i>

45:11.458 --> 45:13.460
<i>And I’m okay with that, Love.</i>

45:25.597 --> 45:29.601
What in the actual... fuck?

45:54.209 --> 45:56.503
Holy shit, perv!

45:59.798 --> 46:01.216
-Ew.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.556
Oh.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.400
Hey, Finch, it’s me. Uh...

46:19.735 --> 46:21.320
Just call me back.

46:37.669 --> 46:39.171
I got a nanny cam

46:39.254 --> 46:44.218
in my apartment
when my crazy ex... broke in.

46:46.094 --> 46:48.555
I was gonna ask
if you wanted to have dinner tonight.

46:49.890 --> 46:53.018
Until I saw you’d already been by.

46:54.269 --> 46:55.979
And found some keys.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.149
Give me the phone.

47:00.442 --> 47:01.902
Don’t make me take it.

47:15.624 --> 47:16.875
What are you gonna do?

47:22.422 --> 47:24.174
I will <i>scream.</i>

47:24.258 --> 47:25.884
It's soundproof.

47:27.052 --> 47:29.429
Just think about Ellie.

47:30.556 --> 47:33.267
She will be alone.

47:50.701 --> 47:51.827
Hey, booger.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.289
This is Dale.

47:56.248 --> 47:57.332
Say hi.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.545
Come on. Get in the car.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.089
Your dad will be home any minute.

48:05.632 --> 48:07.551
You said it would just be us.

48:08.802 --> 48:11.013
How exactly did you think
that was gonna happen?

48:12.639 --> 48:15.225
Come on. I don’t have time for this.
Get in, Joey.

48:21.356 --> 48:23.483
Get in the car.

48:38.582 --> 48:39.583
No.

48:41.710 --> 48:44.254
Oh, no, no, no.

48:44.338 --> 48:47.049
No, no, no!

48:48.258 --> 48:49.259
Don't panic.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.053
I'm not gonna hurt you.

48:51.637 --> 48:53.639
I would never do anything
to hurt you or Ellie.

48:53.722 --> 48:57.601
Will, please, do not leave me in here!

48:57.684 --> 49:00.979
I just need to make some arrangements,
and you will never see me again.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.190
I promise you and Ellie will be fine.

49:04.816 --> 49:05.901
Together.

49:07.819 --> 49:09.279
I just need you to trust me.

49:10.405 --> 49:13.367
Can you trust me, Delilah?
