WEBVTT

00:01.870 --> 00:03.636
I intend to ensure
that you hang!

00:03.638 --> 00:05.271
Do you intend to tell
the authorities

00:05.273 --> 00:06.471
- of my involvement?
- That depends.

00:06.474 --> 00:07.807
What they done
to my brothers...

00:07.809 --> 00:09.976
I can't find the strength
to move past the memory.

00:09.978 --> 00:11.644
The druids,
they don't mess around.

00:11.646 --> 00:13.946
A gun, a knife... they're
just tools to get a job done.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.214
Two dead, five missing.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.150
- All from five points.
- How about a drink?

00:17.152 --> 00:19.952
I can't have a repeat killer
hunting my streets.

01:06.667 --> 01:10.603
Paper! Get your paper!

01:10.605 --> 01:12.505
Murder trial!

01:12.507 --> 01:14.073
Oh, this one's a good one.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.508
Paper!

01:18.113 --> 01:19.479
Ah!

01:19.481 --> 01:21.280
Goddamn it, Doman!

01:21.282 --> 01:23.015
For God sakes, stop!

01:26.253 --> 01:27.553
Ooh oh ohh!

01:31.792 --> 01:33.893
Ooh!

01:33.895 --> 01:35.628
Agh!

01:35.630 --> 01:36.996
Mr. Doman, ain't it?

01:36.998 --> 01:39.432
Imagine,

01:39.434 --> 01:41.300
running into you
this fine morning.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.437
That's the second time

01:44.439 --> 01:45.838
you've tried to hoop it on me,

01:45.840 --> 01:47.206
Doman!

01:47.208 --> 01:48.674
We're going to have a chat
about those six missing boys

01:48.676 --> 01:50.376
and the drugs we found
in your pocket.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.779
Oh, no. No no no, Detective.

01:52.781 --> 01:54.147
That... that was medicine

01:54.149 --> 01:56.649
in my pocket, legal medicine.

01:56.651 --> 01:57.650
I got piles.

01:57.652 --> 01:59.085
Then what are you doing,

01:59.087 --> 02:00.520
putting medicine
in another man's drink?

02:00.522 --> 02:01.954
Oh, did I?

02:01.956 --> 02:04.657
Must've thought
the mug was my own.

02:04.659 --> 02:06.092
A crowded bar...
honest mistake.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.627
Nothing honest
about it, you toad.

02:10.997 --> 02:14.700
Opinions aside, Detective,

02:14.702 --> 02:16.202
you fellas got no evidence

02:16.204 --> 02:17.570
to prove otherwise.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.910
Let's give him some
time to rethink.

02:23.912 --> 02:26.412
Put him in the suite.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.413
Really?

02:27.415 --> 02:28.414
Yeah.

02:32.787 --> 02:35.788
No.

02:35.790 --> 02:36.989
Aah!

02:36.991 --> 02:38.891
Ohh!

02:38.893 --> 02:40.460
Please.

02:40.462 --> 02:43.129
Please.

02:43.131 --> 02:44.263
Please, stop!

02:44.265 --> 02:47.533
Stop! Stop!

02:47.535 --> 02:50.303
Stop! Get me out of here!

02:50.305 --> 02:52.772
Get me out of here! Please!

02:58.912 --> 03:01.414
Finished!

03:01.416 --> 03:03.950
James, have you seen

03:03.952 --> 03:05.451
my betrothed this morning?

03:05.453 --> 03:07.787
Mrs. Haverford was up
and left early, sir.

03:07.789 --> 03:09.355
Volunteering for the
Ladies Christian Union,

03:09.357 --> 03:10.456
I believe.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.325
On our wedding day.

03:12.327 --> 03:14.527
Remarkable woman.

03:14.529 --> 03:16.963
Simply remarkable.

03:16.965 --> 03:19.632
You got something for me?

03:43.323 --> 03:45.591
You see that my reply's

03:45.593 --> 03:48.094
delivered in a timely manner.

03:48.096 --> 03:50.496
Will there be anything else?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.231
You've told your sweet Robert

03:52.233 --> 03:55.001
the truth of your
involvement with us?

03:55.003 --> 03:57.603
You know, dishonesty
and secrets

03:57.605 --> 04:01.040
are the death of far
too many a marriage.

04:01.042 --> 04:03.309
You need only consider
your previous one.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.611
Congratulations
on your wedding day,

04:05.613 --> 04:07.980
Mrs. Haverford.

04:07.982 --> 04:09.248
I wish you nothing

04:09.250 --> 04:11.183
but great and
perpetual happiness!

04:13.120 --> 04:14.520
A bit smaller, Annie.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.055
I know. I'm not finished yet.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.594
Morning, Kevin.

04:21.596 --> 04:24.163
Didn't hear you come
home last night.

04:24.165 --> 04:25.965
Working a case.

04:25.967 --> 04:27.466
Should I fix you
some breakfast?

04:27.468 --> 04:29.835
No, no. I just came by
to grab something.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.138
But you'll be home in time
for the wedding?

04:32.140 --> 04:33.673
Yeah, of course.

04:33.675 --> 04:35.308
The Major's sending
a carriage to pick us up.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.543
You are the best man,
after all.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.378
There's a...

04:39.380 --> 04:41.280
there's a ceili
at Callahan's tonight.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.683
I was thinking we could
go by afterwards,

04:43.685 --> 04:45.785
make a nice evening of it?

04:45.787 --> 04:47.987
Just like our first date.

04:47.989 --> 04:49.922
You mean the night when,
during the haymakers' jig,

04:49.924 --> 04:51.424
you tripped over old Mrs. Flynn

04:51.426 --> 04:54.827
because you were too
busy gawking at me?

04:54.829 --> 04:56.662
Got me a second date,
if I recall.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.444
Do you want these
in the kitchen, doc?

05:11.446 --> 05:14.213
Yes, sir. Okay.

05:14.215 --> 05:15.381
Never imagined

05:15.383 --> 05:16.882
we'd be seeing
this old place again.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.384
Are you sure you're all right?

05:18.386 --> 05:19.719
Fine.

05:19.721 --> 05:21.754
It's time we made some
new memories here.

05:49.217 --> 05:51.651
Christ, let me out of here!

05:51.653 --> 05:53.219
I thought you weren't
saying another word.

05:53.221 --> 05:54.720
No.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.155
I'm going to give the two
of you some privacy.

05:56.157 --> 05:57.957
No, no no no,
please, please, stop!

05:57.959 --> 05:59.892
I'll tell you anything
you want to know!

05:59.894 --> 06:02.361
But I didn't kill anybody!

06:02.363 --> 06:04.263
I was just doing my job!

06:04.265 --> 06:05.264
I swear.

06:05.266 --> 06:06.666
I work for the government!

06:06.668 --> 06:08.501
Bullshit!

06:08.503 --> 06:09.669
No, no! No! No!

06:09.671 --> 06:11.337
I'm telling the truth!

06:11.339 --> 06:14.006
I recruit soldiers
for the union army.

06:14.008 --> 06:15.908
Please!

06:15.910 --> 06:17.777
Now get me out of here!

06:24.284 --> 06:26.385
Amigone funeral
parlor's set up.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.155
They'll take twice
as much next week.

06:29.157 --> 06:30.423
Criminy, Francis.

06:30.425 --> 06:33.125
O'Rourke's going to be
right pleased to hear that.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.760
Speaking of which, I'd be happy

06:34.762 --> 06:36.262
to deliver the news
myself. Ain't properly

06:36.264 --> 06:37.763
had the chance
to meet the man yet.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.232
Ah, I'm not supposed to.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.567
Ah, come on, now, Seamus.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.437
I been doing good work for
the druids, ain't I? Sure.

06:44.439 --> 06:46.605
So what's the harm in
introducing me to O'Rourke?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.407
Especially coming from you,

06:48.409 --> 06:50.376
one of his favorite boys.

06:50.378 --> 06:52.478
That's a good point.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.313
A word from me
would mean a lot.

06:54.315 --> 06:56.515
Ah, then the matter's settled.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.650
Well, no.

06:57.652 --> 06:59.618
Ah, you're a fine
man, Mr. Walsh,

06:59.620 --> 07:01.454
no matter what your
brother-in-law says.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.426
You have to see this.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.494
He stinks all the way up here.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.762
Really? Here.

07:09.764 --> 07:12.765
Stop! Stop! I'm freezing.

07:14.202 --> 07:17.870
I'm what some call
a bounty broker.

07:17.872 --> 07:20.272
For each soldier
we sign up, we get paid.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.075
Usually, I have no problems
talking them into joining.

07:23.077 --> 07:26.946
A little whiskey,
a few tales of glory,

07:26.948 --> 07:30.616
they'd be all fired up
for Uncle Sam

07:30.618 --> 07:32.118
and a paycheck.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.154
War drags on, huh?

07:35.156 --> 07:36.789
Word of the slaughter

07:36.791 --> 07:38.290
trickles up north, doesn't it?

07:38.292 --> 07:40.793
Ain't as appealing,
once you see men

07:40.795 --> 07:42.161
returning home missing
their arms and legs.

07:42.163 --> 07:43.796
So you started drugging them?

07:43.798 --> 07:46.565
Ah, I prefer "loosening
their inhibitions."

07:46.567 --> 07:47.900
Let's call it kidnapping.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.401
Hit him again.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.270
That's what you're doing,
ain't it, pimp, huh?!

07:51.272 --> 07:53.139
Is that what it is?!

07:53.141 --> 07:54.240
You stink!

07:54.242 --> 07:56.375
Hit him again. Go!

07:56.377 --> 07:57.877
Look...

07:57.879 --> 07:59.478
you're shanghaiing these boys

07:59.480 --> 08:00.980
and shipping them off
to wake up

08:00.982 --> 08:02.648
in the middle of
some goddamn field!

08:02.650 --> 08:05.284
You got to understand...
there's quotas to fill.

08:05.286 --> 08:07.953
If we don't procure the men,

08:07.955 --> 08:09.622
some other broker will.

08:09.624 --> 08:10.990
Again.

08:10.992 --> 08:12.725
So how did the McGrath
boy end up dead?

08:12.727 --> 08:14.794
Oh, no no no.
That was my partner.

08:14.796 --> 08:17.296
Calls himself "John Smith".

08:17.298 --> 08:19.131
He tipped me off
to the brothers,

08:19.133 --> 08:20.533
said they'd make
solid recruits.

08:20.535 --> 08:22.301
And, while the two of us
would normally

08:22.303 --> 08:25.304
work a pair like them
together, he went off

08:25.306 --> 08:27.206
and hired some goon
to take his spot!

08:27.208 --> 08:28.574
What sort of goon?

08:28.576 --> 08:30.276
Big, bavarian fellow

08:30.278 --> 08:32.211
named Brubacher.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.645
Never met him before.

08:33.648 --> 08:35.114
Never seen since.

08:35.116 --> 08:36.849
You're saying

08:36.851 --> 08:38.350
he killed John McGrath?

08:38.352 --> 08:39.952
We bought the boys a round,

08:39.953 --> 08:41.352
put a few drops
in their rag water,

08:41.355 --> 08:43.923
helped them out of the bar.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.393
Then, one of the brothers
starts struggling

08:47.395 --> 08:49.695
and my Sauerkraut-eating
pal goes berserk,

08:49.697 --> 08:51.697
starts beating the breath
out of the poor kid.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.332
Why didn't you just stop him?

08:53.334 --> 08:55.301
He was pure muscle
and hardtack!

08:55.303 --> 08:57.837
I wasn't about to

08:57.839 --> 09:01.841
get my head caved in, so I...

09:01.843 --> 09:03.342
I took off.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.880
I told my partner
I'd stick to solo work.

09:07.882 --> 09:09.715
Where's this partner
of yours and where

09:09.717 --> 09:11.217
are the rest of
those missing boys?

09:11.219 --> 09:13.052
I don't know. I don't know.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.053
Again.

09:14.055 --> 09:15.654
No, no. No.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.556
We need more men.
For what reason?

09:17.558 --> 09:20.426
You've already got
the suspect in custody.

09:20.428 --> 09:23.495
He works with a partner.
Goes by "John Smith".

09:23.497 --> 09:24.930
We're guessing that
ain't his given name.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.432
Doman snatches the recruits,

09:26.434 --> 09:27.933
then hands them over to Smith,

09:27.935 --> 09:29.401
who delivers the boys
to the union,

09:29.403 --> 09:30.903
and today's delivery day.

09:30.905 --> 09:32.805
According to Doman.

09:32.807 --> 09:34.607
When is this delivery?

09:34.609 --> 09:36.609
Claims he doesn't know.

09:36.611 --> 09:38.878
And where are the boys now?

09:38.880 --> 09:41.480
Not sure.

09:41.482 --> 09:43.482
Only location Doman met Smith,

09:43.484 --> 09:44.984
aside from taverns,

09:44.986 --> 09:47.219
was an office off Delancey.

09:47.221 --> 09:49.555
So, you expect me
to reassign my men,

09:49.557 --> 09:51.957
based off the claims of a crook

09:51.959 --> 09:53.559
who offers no proof in return?

09:53.561 --> 09:55.661
No, I expect you to do it

09:55.663 --> 09:57.463
based on my judgment, sir.

09:57.465 --> 09:58.564
Request denied.

09:58.566 --> 10:00.099
I've just sent 20 men
over to the 8th

10:00.101 --> 10:01.867
to help put down a donnybrook.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.270
Besides, if this so-
called partner exists,

10:04.272 --> 10:06.705
I feel certain my most
capable detectives,

10:06.707 --> 10:08.207
lord Corcoran,
and Duke McSavage,

10:08.209 --> 10:11.110
will turn up actual
evidence in proving it.

10:11.112 --> 10:12.778
Now, unless there's
something more important

10:12.780 --> 10:15.648
on today's agenda,
your highnessness.

10:15.650 --> 10:16.682
Good.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.183
Then I suggest
you move your asses

10:18.185 --> 10:19.985
and get your jobs
done, gentlemen.

10:22.224 --> 10:23.725
Can I get the crystal
vases here

10:23.727 --> 10:25.226
with the cream roses,
and we need to replace all

10:25.228 --> 10:27.062
of these candles on both.

10:27.064 --> 10:29.197
Yes, ma'am.

10:29.199 --> 10:31.099
I have a confession to make.

10:31.101 --> 10:32.767
A confession?

10:32.769 --> 10:33.968
Yes. This morning, I wondered

10:33.970 --> 10:35.370
if you had finally ran off,

10:35.372 --> 10:36.771
realizing your mistake

10:36.773 --> 10:38.306
in agreeing to this marriage.

10:38.308 --> 10:39.741
The silver's being loaded

10:39.743 --> 10:41.242
into the carriage as we speak.

10:41.244 --> 10:42.710
Pity.

10:42.712 --> 10:44.212
Then I should
take one last look

10:44.214 --> 10:47.482
to remember you by.

10:47.484 --> 10:50.785
But, on the off-chance
you do decide to stay,

10:50.787 --> 10:53.555
any final words before
we take the plunge?

10:53.557 --> 10:56.157
Words are inefficient,
dear Robert.

11:01.932 --> 11:04.365
No signal for another train

11:04.367 --> 11:07.068
no further down the line

11:07.070 --> 11:09.871
oh, sinner,
you are truly lost

11:09.873 --> 11:12.507
to the ones you left behind

11:12.509 --> 11:14.776
get onboard

11:14.778 --> 11:17.545
get onboard

11:17.547 --> 11:20.181
get onboard

11:23.920 --> 11:25.153
Matthew.

11:25.155 --> 11:27.288
Don't just stand there,

11:27.290 --> 11:29.390
smiling like a Sunday drunk.

11:32.362 --> 11:33.862
There is plenty to do today.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.335
Well, I'd best just

11:40.337 --> 11:41.703
get right to work, then.

11:41.705 --> 11:43.471
Mm-hmm.

11:57.386 --> 12:00.255
Miss Heissen.
What a nice surprise.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.559
Thought I would
welcome you folks

12:04.561 --> 12:06.461
back to the neighborhood.

12:06.463 --> 12:09.731
Traditional pastries
from my homeland,

12:09.733 --> 12:11.533
along with a bottle of
Kohler & Frohling wine,

12:11.535 --> 12:12.667
from California.

12:12.669 --> 12:16.404
That's very thoughtful of you.

12:16.406 --> 12:18.206
After the hospitality
you showed me,

12:18.208 --> 12:19.908
this is the least I can do.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.809
This is John Smith's place,

12:21.811 --> 12:25.213
but I don't what's here
that'll tell you anything.

12:25.215 --> 12:28.049
His real name, for instance.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.885
Long as I got paid,
it didn't matter to me.

12:30.887 --> 12:32.220
You telling me

12:32.222 --> 12:37.725
you never picked up
on something, anything,

12:37.727 --> 12:40.828
overheard a name, a number?

12:40.830 --> 12:42.730
Because, if that's
really the case...

12:42.732 --> 12:46.534
Then we got no more use for ya.

12:46.536 --> 12:51.172
I never killed a man,
until the war.

12:51.174 --> 12:52.941
The first one, that was...

12:52.943 --> 12:55.276
That was hard.

12:55.278 --> 12:59.280
Harder on him, of course.

12:59.282 --> 13:00.715
After the first dozen,

13:00.717 --> 13:02.550
killing came easy.

13:02.552 --> 13:03.885
Top shelf, on the left.

13:03.887 --> 13:05.920
There's a file of his.
I used to

13:05.922 --> 13:07.422
sneak peeks at it,
from time to time,

13:07.424 --> 13:09.157
make sure I was getting
my fair share.

13:11.093 --> 13:13.795
Invoices, bills.

13:13.797 --> 13:15.029
Anything useful?

13:15.031 --> 13:18.399
Maybe.

13:18.401 --> 13:20.034
Name of U.S. army
recruiting officer

13:20.036 --> 13:21.703
Sergeant Major Atticus Reid.

13:21.705 --> 13:23.938
Smith's contact?

13:23.940 --> 13:25.640
Could be. I'll pay him
a visit. You stay here,

13:25.642 --> 13:27.308
keep looking for something
that'll help us find Smith.

13:27.310 --> 13:28.610
You sure you got time for that?

13:28.612 --> 13:30.178
I could go to the
recruiter myself.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.980
You got to get to that wedding.

13:31.982 --> 13:33.881
I've got more time
than those boys have.

13:33.883 --> 13:35.516
Besides, I'm hoping
my past service

13:35.518 --> 13:37.151
will help convince
this sergeant major

13:37.153 --> 13:39.387
to cooperate.

13:42.492 --> 13:44.826
You enter at your own risk.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.468
Uh, this week's take,
Mr. O'Rourke.

13:55.971 --> 13:57.472
And, uh, this here is, uh...

13:57.474 --> 13:59.607
Francis Maguire.

13:59.609 --> 14:01.242
Yeah. He's been doing

14:01.244 --> 14:02.944
such a good job for us,
I thought, well...

14:02.946 --> 14:05.847
Thank you, Seamus.

14:05.849 --> 14:07.181
Of course.

14:09.285 --> 14:10.985
That means you may leave.

14:20.629 --> 14:25.533
So, you're the
one-eyed Detective.

14:25.535 --> 14:27.735
I ain't a Detective no more.

14:27.737 --> 14:31.272
You still got
the bad eye, though.

14:31.274 --> 14:32.307
Sit down.

14:38.180 --> 14:41.015
Now, why would you have
poor, wee Seamus

14:41.017 --> 14:43.284
bring you down here, Detective?

14:43.286 --> 14:45.186
I wanted to express
my appreciation to you,

14:45.188 --> 14:47.922
for giving me some work.

14:47.924 --> 14:50.325
I give you shite work,
which can be done

14:50.327 --> 14:51.859
by an idiot with half a brain.

14:51.861 --> 14:53.761
Seamus, for example.

14:53.763 --> 14:56.597
Are you happy with
shite work, Detective?

14:56.599 --> 14:58.499
Think I could be more than just

14:58.501 --> 15:01.302
some delivery boy... an asset.

15:08.377 --> 15:10.178
A few years back,

15:10.180 --> 15:11.579
me cousin got pinched,

15:11.581 --> 15:13.748
lifting goods from
Joe hill's grocery.

15:17.519 --> 15:19.520
Did I arrest him?

15:23.559 --> 15:25.059
You shot him in the ass.

15:29.732 --> 15:33.401
Ah, my cousin's a prick.

15:33.403 --> 15:34.902
I'm sure he deserved

15:34.904 --> 15:37.605
to bleed.

15:37.607 --> 15:38.973
I want to know what you're

15:38.975 --> 15:41.309
really offering, Detective.

15:41.311 --> 15:43.911
A man with no options

15:43.913 --> 15:46.714
will do anything to survive.

15:46.716 --> 15:47.815
I'm yours.

15:47.817 --> 15:50.885
Give me more responsibility.

15:50.887 --> 15:56.290
Generous offer,
but also problematic.

15:56.292 --> 15:59.894
Even with your supposed
fall from grace,

15:59.896 --> 16:03.197
in my experience, once
a cop, always a cop.

16:03.199 --> 16:06.634
Then let me prove meself.

16:06.636 --> 16:07.735
Mr. Maguire,

16:07.737 --> 16:09.504
I still have two good eyes

16:09.506 --> 16:12.640
and I believe
what I see with them.

16:12.642 --> 16:14.876
The only way I'd ever
trust a fella like you

16:14.878 --> 16:17.678
is if you took out
one of your own.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.046
You'll have to kill a copper.

16:22.576 --> 16:24.155
Fair enough.

16:26.055 --> 16:27.755
Got just the fella
in mind, as well.

16:29.337 --> 16:30.904
We have to leave
for the wedding.

16:34.809 --> 16:36.543
There's too much
to do down here.

16:36.545 --> 16:39.012
Sara, the gown you created

16:39.014 --> 16:40.714
will be perfect.

16:40.716 --> 16:42.649
The guests will welcome us,

16:42.651 --> 16:47.554
conversation,
there'll be dancing.

16:47.556 --> 16:51.758
Besides, we must go.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.094
Major Morehouse has
agreed to assist me

16:54.096 --> 16:55.562
in my search for your mother.

16:55.564 --> 17:00.834
What? Matthew... no.

17:00.836 --> 17:03.303
I told you I don't want
to be in anyone's debt.

17:03.305 --> 17:05.739
I have exhausted

17:05.741 --> 17:08.340
all options in my search.

17:08.343 --> 17:11.011
She sold, but,

17:11.012 --> 17:12.512
I can't find out where.

17:12.513 --> 17:16.116
The Major's effort
will be our last

17:16.117 --> 17:18.585
and, most likely, best resort.

17:18.587 --> 17:20.854
And, Sara.

17:22.857 --> 17:25.358
You want to see your mother

17:25.359 --> 17:27.426
and our friend

17:27.429 --> 17:31.031
will help us make that happen.

17:31.033 --> 17:32.065
So...

17:35.202 --> 17:36.936
Let us be friendly in return,

17:36.938 --> 17:40.340
go and celebrate
his wedding day.

17:55.156 --> 17:57.824
You don't waltz in here
and dictate how

17:57.826 --> 18:00.393
the United States government
goes about business, son.

18:00.395 --> 18:02.128
Not when your people tried

18:02.130 --> 18:03.830
to tear this goddamn city down,

18:03.832 --> 18:05.265
just to avoid the draft.

18:05.267 --> 18:06.733
My... People have done

18:06.735 --> 18:08.168
more than their share
in this war.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.538
Yeah, you Irish have a talent

18:11.540 --> 18:14.574
for fighting and dying...
that, I'll give ya.

18:14.576 --> 18:17.077
These are kids
we're talking about.

18:17.079 --> 18:18.645
So you said.

18:18.647 --> 18:20.914
I'll fill you in
on a little secret.

18:20.916 --> 18:22.615
I don't give a tinker's damn

18:22.617 --> 18:23.983
where these kids come from.

18:23.985 --> 18:25.885
We need bodies so bad,

18:25.887 --> 18:27.854
we're taking niggers now,
for Christ's sake.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.355
This is kidnapping,
Sergeant Major...

18:29.357 --> 18:30.523
look, shitbird,

18:30.525 --> 18:34.327
I get that you've got
a job to do.

18:34.329 --> 18:36.096
So do I.

18:36.098 --> 18:37.964
And this goddamn war

18:37.966 --> 18:39.666
tearing our country apart,

18:39.668 --> 18:43.570
is bigger than you,
me, or a handful

18:43.572 --> 18:45.605
of the five points slumrats.

18:45.607 --> 18:49.676
You, of all people,

18:49.678 --> 18:51.945
should damn well know
that to be true.

18:51.947 --> 18:56.082
Perfumed generals don't
win wars, corporal,

18:56.084 --> 18:58.451
Cannon fodder does.

18:58.453 --> 18:59.686
Stopped being a corporal

18:59.688 --> 19:03.022
seven months ago, sarge.

19:03.024 --> 19:04.824
Thanks for the time.

19:08.896 --> 19:10.230
Detective,

19:10.232 --> 19:12.398
I believe you
dropped something.

19:17.071 --> 19:19.572
By sundown, they'll
likely be gone.

19:19.574 --> 19:21.107
You'll need to hurry.

19:31.385 --> 19:33.219
Go upstairs, get changed.

19:33.221 --> 19:34.187
Really?

19:34.189 --> 19:36.589
Yes. I'm not about to attend

19:36.591 --> 19:38.558
a high-society
wedding by myself.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.263
The bride is ready, sir.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.131
Mr. Morehouse,
your bride is ready.

19:45.133 --> 19:46.633
We need to begin.

19:46.635 --> 19:48.935
My best man isn't...
right this way.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.104
This may be him.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.873
There's his wife.

20:25.306 --> 20:27.874
Join me, James.
You've been drafted.

20:27.876 --> 20:29.876
This is highly unregular, sir.

20:29.878 --> 20:32.312
When have you known me
to follow convention?

20:32.314 --> 20:34.447
Besides, who better
to be my best man,

20:34.449 --> 20:36.516
than one who sees me
naked each day?

21:11.051 --> 21:13.453
I require and charge you both,

21:13.455 --> 21:15.688
as ye shall answer

21:15.690 --> 21:17.290
at the dreadful day of judgment

21:17.292 --> 21:19.158
when the secrets of all hearts

21:19.160 --> 21:21.928
shall be disclosed,
if either of you know

21:21.930 --> 21:24.764
any impediment
why ye should not

21:24.766 --> 21:26.599
lawfully join together
in matrimony,

21:26.601 --> 21:27.934
ye must now

21:27.936 --> 21:29.369
confess it.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.504
This cop we're looking for,

21:31.506 --> 21:34.774
I trust it's
something personal.

21:34.776 --> 21:36.209
If it wasn't for this fella,

21:36.211 --> 21:37.710
I'd still have me job,

21:37.712 --> 21:40.847
me old life.

21:40.849 --> 21:42.348
Really, though,

21:42.350 --> 21:43.783
just better him than me.

21:43.785 --> 21:46.552
Always is, Detective.

21:49.456 --> 21:52.458
Any prig can pull a trigger.

21:52.460 --> 21:55.561
I'd prefer you get
your hands dirty.

21:55.563 --> 21:58.197
Unless you don't think you can

21:58.199 --> 21:59.699
get this close,

21:59.701 --> 22:01.534
see into his eyes.

22:01.536 --> 22:03.736
I, Robert Luther Morehouse,

22:03.738 --> 22:06.306
take thee, Elizabeth Victoria,

22:06.308 --> 22:07.974
to be my wedded wife,

22:07.976 --> 22:10.143
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

22:10.145 --> 22:13.446
for better and for worse,

22:13.448 --> 22:15.682
for richer and poorer,

22:15.684 --> 22:17.317
in sickness and in health,

22:17.319 --> 22:21.287
to love and to cherish

22:21.289 --> 22:22.989
until death do us part.

22:28.195 --> 22:30.863
By the giving
and receiving of a ring

22:30.865 --> 22:32.932
and the joining of hands,

22:32.934 --> 22:34.901
I pronounce they are
man and wife.

22:34.903 --> 22:37.236
Blood-red on copper-blue.

22:37.238 --> 22:39.539
In the name of the father
and of the son

22:39.541 --> 22:40.973
and of the holy ghost.

22:40.975 --> 22:42.508
My favorite colors.

22:42.510 --> 22:44.410
May the lord bless and
preserve you...

22:44.412 --> 22:45.845
Both in this life

22:45.847 --> 22:48.848
and in the world to come.

23:38.149 --> 23:39.583
There he is,

23:39.585 --> 23:41.318
the luckiest one-
legged millionaire

23:41.320 --> 23:43.187
in all of New York City.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.255
All of us millionaires

23:44.257 --> 23:45.623
are missing some part
of ourselves,

23:45.625 --> 23:47.157
Mr. Donovan.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.426
A brain, a heart.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.828
And, Mrs. Morehouse,

23:50.830 --> 23:52.296
you look lovely.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.530
Why, thank you.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.633
We may be neighbors soon.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.067
The Coddington place

23:57.069 --> 23:58.435
is rumored to be up for sale

23:58.437 --> 23:59.770
and the missus and I

23:59.772 --> 24:01.138
will be putting in a bid.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.908
Oh, I would've thought
you'd be obligated

24:03.910 --> 24:05.409
to reside in the sixth ward,

24:05.411 --> 24:08.245
considering your
political office.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.414
No, no, we amended the city
charter just last year.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.750
There's no requirement
for me to live anywhere.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.451
Isn't democracy

24:14.453 --> 24:16.520
a beautiful thing, altogether?

24:16.522 --> 24:17.755
Excuse me.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.760
The mayor sends his regrets.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.229
Gunther's worried over
his reelection prospects.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.464
I'm well aware of
my atypical reputation.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.099
A reputation,
as some of us recall,

24:29.101 --> 24:31.335
that includes foiling
a dangerous

24:31.337 --> 24:32.703
confederate plot
singlehandedly.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.071
There were many fine men...

24:34.073 --> 24:35.773
and you'll be testifying
against Kennedy

24:35.775 --> 24:38.075
at his trial.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.744
As the proceedings are
a secret military tribunal,

24:40.746 --> 24:42.413
I can neither confirm nor deny

24:42.415 --> 24:43.948
any involvement.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.430
What?

25:14.279 --> 25:15.779
How many of you are there?

25:15.781 --> 25:18.048
Six.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.918
It's all right.
You'll be all right.

25:26.925 --> 25:28.459
McGrath?

25:28.461 --> 25:30.260
Detective Corcoran.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.628
Thank God you're here.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.163
I... I left word

25:33.165 --> 25:34.932
that I tracked down
my boy and I was...

25:34.934 --> 25:37.034
I was coming down here
to get him out of here.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.168
To get them all out of here.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.804
"John Smith".

25:40.806 --> 25:42.306
Your boys would've
recognized you.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.109
That's why you
hired the Bavarian

25:45.111 --> 25:47.011
to go along with Doman.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.413
You Michael?

25:49.415 --> 25:50.414
Yeah.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.249
I'm a Detective.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.617
Can you free the rest
of these boys?

25:53.619 --> 25:55.085
Yeah.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.487
You get all high and
mighty, if you like,

25:56.489 --> 25:58.355
but you don't know him

25:58.357 --> 26:00.591
or the other one,
my so-called sons.

26:00.593 --> 26:04.595
Years on the road,
providing for them

26:04.597 --> 26:06.997
and their worthless
drunk of a mother,

26:06.999 --> 26:08.532
only to come home

26:08.534 --> 26:10.100
and be treated like scum.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.869
They're your sons.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.638
They were her sons.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.307
Go on, get out.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.309
So you started to sell 'em off.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.744
Well, it's about time
I finally got a return

26:20.746 --> 26:22.179
for them lazy shits.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.614
Sir!

26:23.616 --> 26:25.182
Michael, your brother is dead

26:25.184 --> 26:29.520
because of this lousy bastard.

26:29.522 --> 26:31.722
I know.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.058
Still, I ain't sure

26:34.060 --> 26:35.793
Johnny would've wanted this.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.862
But he deserves to suffer,

26:38.864 --> 26:41.465
cold and alone,
like he left us here.

26:41.467 --> 26:43.667
Let him live out
his days in chains.

26:48.373 --> 26:49.807
Go on.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.308
Thank you, sir.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.876
Tell your ma she
doesn't have to worry

26:52.878 --> 26:54.344
about him anymore.

26:58.216 --> 27:00.417
Whoa! Whoa.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.486
Don't seem near enough justice,

27:02.488 --> 27:05.155
to see you in chains.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.691
So you're going to kill me?

27:07.693 --> 27:10.828
I'll give you a choice...

27:10.830 --> 27:12.329
more than than you ever
offered your own sons.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.364
Either I end this now

27:14.366 --> 27:17.601
or you learn firsthand
what dying looks like.

27:20.605 --> 27:22.106
Why, Annie Reilly,

27:22.108 --> 27:24.007
what were you doing up there?

27:24.009 --> 27:25.809
Uh, looking for my coat.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.111
I am well past my bedtime.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.612
We have people for that,
Miss Reilly. Hmm.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.980
Tell the help,

27:29.982 --> 27:31.348
and they'll fetch
your belongings.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.850
You never looked handsomer,

27:32.852 --> 27:34.151
Mr. Morehouse.

27:42.794 --> 27:43.894
Not exactly

27:43.896 --> 27:45.529
how I envisioned
our wedding night.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.740
Look at you, Robert.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.447
You may be a Morehouse by name,

28:03.449 --> 28:06.383
but tolerance
for this indulgence

28:06.385 --> 28:09.186
takes a lifetime
of practice, my dear.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.821
Mm.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.560
I don't deserve you.

28:16.562 --> 28:20.264
I don't deserve any joy.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.599
I'm a terrible person.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.334
Shh.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.435
You're exhausted.

28:25.437 --> 28:28.572
No.

28:28.574 --> 28:33.010
No, I'm... I'm a charlatan,

28:33.012 --> 28:35.379
a deceiver who, before
all her friends

28:35.381 --> 28:37.047
and family,
before God himself...

28:37.049 --> 28:44.154
Elizabeth, you're
speaking nonsense.

28:44.156 --> 28:47.925
I know exactly whom I married.

28:47.927 --> 28:51.662
If you knew,

28:51.664 --> 28:55.065
you would despise me.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.601
You could be the devil himself,

28:57.603 --> 28:59.903
and I would still find
you irresistible.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.282
I conspired in the plot

29:12.284 --> 29:14.017
to burn New York City.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.691
I think, perhaps,

29:20.693 --> 29:22.192
we should take a rest
from the opium.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.694
Mr. Kennedy came to me

29:23.696 --> 29:25.229
shortly after Winfred's death,

29:25.231 --> 29:26.797
seeking financial support.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.298
I was vulnerable and I...

29:28.300 --> 29:30.734
this isn't funny.

29:30.736 --> 29:32.236
The fires were only to be

29:32.238 --> 29:34.104
a sign of protest,

29:34.106 --> 29:35.606
when places were deserted,

29:35.608 --> 29:36.707
no casualties.

29:36.709 --> 29:37.908
Elizabeth, stop.

29:37.910 --> 29:41.478
They preyed upon my naiveté.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.180
Forgive me, Robert.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.148
Forgive you?

29:45.150 --> 29:46.984
Forgive you?!

29:46.986 --> 29:49.553
Do you realize

29:49.555 --> 29:51.555
that I exiled my father

29:51.557 --> 29:53.890
for his involvement?
My own father!

29:53.892 --> 29:57.160
What else are you involved in?

29:57.162 --> 29:58.795
What lies have you sown?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.297
It was a terrible mistake.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.599
I had nowhere to turn.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.801
Those vows you spoke earlier...

30:04.803 --> 30:10.073
did you mean a word of them?

30:10.075 --> 30:11.642
Do you even love me?

30:11.644 --> 30:13.644
Yes, of course.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.846
Of course!

30:15.848 --> 30:17.881
Robert, I love you.

30:17.883 --> 30:20.617
Please, I need you, Robert.

30:20.619 --> 30:23.053
Robert, I need you!

30:23.055 --> 30:24.955
Please, if you testify...!

30:24.957 --> 30:27.791
God, Robert! Please!

30:27.793 --> 30:30.060
Please!

30:35.900 --> 30:38.969
Welcome to the
United States army.

30:38.971 --> 30:42.673
Now, for your enlistment bonus.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.242
I'll ensure his family
receives it.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.743
You find any more fresh fish,

30:46.745 --> 30:49.513
you send 'em my way, Irish.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.848
"Union, now and forever",

30:51.850 --> 30:53.417
private McGrath.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.459
Ellen,

31:02.461 --> 31:05.028
I should've sent word, I know.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.863
Tonight,

31:06.865 --> 31:10.367
something came up,
something important.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.768
I had to keep on the move.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.170
It's all right.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.571
I know I promised you.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.306
I said it's all right, Kevin.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.808
But you should apologize

31:17.810 --> 31:20.477
to Mr. Morehouse.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.045
There were lives at stake.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.580
There always are.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.887
Say what you want
to say, Ellen.

31:34.892 --> 31:36.393
You have this instinct

31:36.395 --> 31:39.663
to protect people, Kevin.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.933
I love that in you,

31:42.935 --> 31:46.136
the nobility,

31:46.138 --> 31:48.138
but, sometimes, I can't help

31:48.140 --> 31:50.140
but feel that you...

31:50.142 --> 31:54.611
you choose to save
others' lives

31:54.613 --> 31:56.413
at the expense of our own.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.015
It was just a wedding.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.083
No.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.119
No, this is how
life's always been,

32:02.121 --> 32:03.820
ever since the beginning.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.322
When you were a boxer,

32:05.324 --> 32:06.823
you used to leave
for days at a time,

32:06.825 --> 32:08.325
going from match to match.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.826
Trying to provide for us,

32:09.828 --> 32:12.429
for our family,
to give you things,

32:12.431 --> 32:13.930
more than a dirt floor.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.499
How did volunteering
for another man's war

32:15.501 --> 32:17.501
provide for us?

32:21.973 --> 32:23.840
I did what I thought was best.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.342
For you.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.011
For us.

32:28.013 --> 32:30.480
For our daughter.

32:30.482 --> 32:35.719
She was 18 months old
when you left.

32:40.091 --> 32:42.959
You remember that time

32:42.961 --> 32:44.461
we came back from Peekskill

32:44.463 --> 32:46.696
and Maggie was burning up

32:46.698 --> 32:48.131
with this fever

32:48.133 --> 32:50.000
and the first hospital
we came to

32:50.002 --> 32:51.601
refused to treat her

32:51.603 --> 32:53.837
because we were Irish?

32:53.839 --> 32:56.273
How does going off to war
change that, Kevin?

32:56.275 --> 32:57.674
That day, I swore an oath

32:57.676 --> 32:59.676
to myself, to Maggie,

32:59.678 --> 33:03.580
that she would never be
treated that way again,

33:03.582 --> 33:05.081
that she would
grow up to be seen

33:05.083 --> 33:06.450
as an American.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.852
By fighting another man's war,

33:08.854 --> 33:10.921
it became my war,

33:10.923 --> 33:15.692
my country, our country.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.160
That Maggie belonged here.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.729
And, yet, the house is empty.

33:51.604 --> 33:53.438
Detective!

33:53.440 --> 33:56.741
C'mere.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.243
I thought it was the groom

33:58.245 --> 34:00.278
that got cold feet.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.213
Ha. Loose ends
with the McGrath case

34:02.215 --> 34:04.049
needed tying up.

34:04.051 --> 34:06.985
Let me give you a tip.

34:06.987 --> 34:10.355
You're fine police
and your dedication

34:10.357 --> 34:12.657
to the job is admirable.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.159
Fellas like you and me,

34:14.161 --> 34:15.659
where we come from,

34:15.661 --> 34:17.728
can't be passing up
opportunities,

34:17.731 --> 34:19.464
can't be breaking a commitment

34:19.466 --> 34:21.266
to important people.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.867
So if you fancy a life
beyond that

34:22.869 --> 34:24.902
hunk of metal hanging
in your pocket,

34:24.905 --> 34:27.038
you'd best start thinking
past the street.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.107
Yes, sir. Thanks
for the advice.

34:29.109 --> 34:30.809
I'm only looking out for ya.

34:30.811 --> 34:33.311
Now, go have yourself
a drink, on me.

34:33.313 --> 34:36.246
Thank you. All right?

34:36.248 --> 34:38.917
Richie.

34:45.056 --> 34:47.025
Evening, stranger.

34:47.027 --> 34:50.462
You have your money
smile on tonight.

34:50.464 --> 34:51.929
Not a vacant room in the joint.

34:51.931 --> 34:54.065
We're filled to the gills.

34:54.067 --> 34:55.900
Even your friend

34:55.902 --> 34:57.602
Robert Morehouse is here.

34:57.604 --> 34:59.838
On his wedding night?

34:59.840 --> 35:01.539
Seems he's decided
to play the gander

35:01.541 --> 35:03.274
and spend the Eve
with anyone but

35:03.276 --> 35:04.642
the new missus.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.643
Christ.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.678
Not that I'm complaining,

35:06.680 --> 35:10.181
mind you...
he tips like a turk.

35:10.183 --> 35:13.251
But you may want
to check his pulse.

35:13.253 --> 35:18.089
Not looking so swell
yourself, Corky.

35:18.091 --> 35:20.158
Long day.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.160
Trouble at home?

35:22.162 --> 35:23.728
Never been better.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.864
Bullshit.

35:29.635 --> 35:31.503
Sometimes I am a butcher

35:31.505 --> 35:34.372
and then I feel
fat ware, sir

35:34.374 --> 35:36.774
and if the flank be
fleshed well

35:36.776 --> 35:38.776
I take no further care

35:38.778 --> 35:40.879
sometimes I am a Baker

35:40.881 --> 35:42.380
and bake both white
and brown

35:42.382 --> 35:44.249
Kevin!

35:44.251 --> 35:45.350
Thank goodness,

35:45.352 --> 35:47.318
the cavalry has arrived.

35:47.320 --> 35:48.686
You want to hear
a real bawdy song,

35:48.688 --> 35:50.622
Corky, here's, your man.

35:50.624 --> 35:53.124
Lottie, get out.

35:53.126 --> 35:55.960
She hasn't heard
the shoemaker verse.

35:55.962 --> 35:58.630
She hasn't.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.637
Ahh.

36:05.639 --> 36:07.238
Well, Kevin,

36:07.240 --> 36:11.042
you've managed
to ruin my day twice.

36:11.044 --> 36:12.343
Let me take you home.

36:12.345 --> 36:14.345
That is not even
remotely an option.

36:14.347 --> 36:17.482
Why? What happened?

36:17.484 --> 36:20.151
Are you taking an interest

36:20.153 --> 36:21.619
in my wedding?

36:21.621 --> 36:23.121
Because there was

36:23.123 --> 36:26.024
a distinct lack
of interest earlier.

36:26.026 --> 36:28.026
I'm sorry.

36:28.028 --> 36:29.527
I didn't have a choice.

36:29.529 --> 36:32.997
Truth be told, your absence was

36:32.999 --> 36:35.833
the least of my disappointment.

36:35.835 --> 36:38.403
Are you

36:38.405 --> 36:40.205
talking about Elizabeth?

36:40.207 --> 36:43.741
Why is it those we hold closest

36:43.743 --> 36:46.744
deceive us?

36:46.746 --> 36:49.414
Everyone hides certain parts

36:49.416 --> 36:52.417
of themselves, major,

36:52.419 --> 36:54.752
especially from
those we care for.

37:02.562 --> 37:04.128
Well, have you
shared your worst

37:04.130 --> 37:06.831
with Elizabeth,

37:06.833 --> 37:08.866
given her a glimpse of

37:08.868 --> 37:11.669
how we were in battle?

37:11.671 --> 37:13.972
Because that's...

37:13.974 --> 37:17.108
that's something my wife
never needs to know.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.776
Certain things

37:18.778 --> 37:20.278
are best left hidden away.

37:23.549 --> 37:28.653
So, you've forgiven Ellen?

37:32.491 --> 37:36.828
Let's just say I'm...

37:36.830 --> 37:38.596
Trying to honor my commitment.

37:45.037 --> 37:47.005
Just like on the battlefield.

38:08.027 --> 38:09.227
Shuffle up, major.

38:09.229 --> 38:12.664
You and me,

38:12.666 --> 38:15.833
we're bunking up tonight.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.735
Then take off
your goddamn boots

38:17.737 --> 38:19.871
before Kennedy strolls in.

38:35.154 --> 38:37.322
Something to drink, lady Sara?

38:37.324 --> 38:39.891
That'd be lovely,
prince Matthew.

38:46.333 --> 38:49.534
Some of miss Heissen's
wine, hmm?

38:55.541 --> 38:59.077
You keep telling me
you're fine.

38:59.079 --> 39:01.813
I am.

39:01.815 --> 39:03.247
I will be.

39:03.249 --> 39:04.916
And, yet, here we are,
looking out

39:04.918 --> 39:06.517
at that same lamppost,
thinking about

39:06.519 --> 39:08.653
what happened to your brothers.

39:08.655 --> 39:11.756
Just a memory.

39:11.758 --> 39:13.591
That memory's part of you.

39:13.593 --> 39:17.328
What you witnessed, it...

39:17.330 --> 39:20.098
is something I'm tired
of running from.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.933
What can I do?

39:21.935 --> 39:24.202
How do I help you turn
around and face it?

39:27.406 --> 39:29.073
You don't.

39:34.680 --> 39:37.281
Sara.

39:37.283 --> 39:38.483
Sara!

39:38.485 --> 39:41.753
Sara.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.257
No more. Sara!

39:50.363 --> 39:51.963
No more, Matthew.

39:54.032 --> 39:55.800
No more.

41:33.232 --> 41:35.967
Let's get the children home.

41:42.841 --> 41:45.042
Oh, my.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.944
Come on, let's go.

41:57.422 --> 42:01.392
Where's your damn partner?

42:01.394 --> 42:03.528
I, uh,

42:03.530 --> 42:06.998
I sent word for him.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.900
Then this is your case.

42:08.902 --> 42:10.801
Yes, sir, captain.

42:10.803 --> 42:13.938
I want names,

42:13.940 --> 42:16.974
I want the culprits
brought to me.

42:16.976 --> 42:19.110
Don't disappoint me, O'Brien.

42:19.112 --> 42:21.045
I'm in a ferorious mood.

42:23.983 --> 42:25.383
Eyes up, gentlemen!

42:25.385 --> 42:28.819
Yes, sir. Aye.

42:28.821 --> 42:32.990
You do not sleep,

42:32.992 --> 42:35.693
you do not leave these streets,

42:35.695 --> 42:38.095
until every last crook, ramper,

42:38.097 --> 42:43.434
and sneakthief
is accounted for.

42:43.436 --> 42:45.603
Crack skulls! Kick asses!

42:45.605 --> 42:46.604
Yes, sir.

42:46.606 --> 42:49.006
Do whatever you must.

42:49.008 --> 42:51.576
Find the no-good son of a bitch

42:51.578 --> 42:54.612
who stabbed that boy.

42:54.614 --> 42:58.082
He was one of our own!

42:58.084 --> 42:59.815
See that justice is done.
