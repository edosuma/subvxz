WEBVTT

00:22.564 --> 00:24.399
TEDDY: Ooh, <i>Ham and Egger!</i>

00:24.482 --> 00:26.443
We don't have ham and eggers, do we?

00:26.526 --> 00:28.236
-No.
-N-Not the food, the movie.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.863
They're gonna show it tonight on TV.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.698
"Don't Count Out The Ham and Egger."

00:31.781 --> 00:32.824
It sounds delicious.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.993
-It's a boxing movie.
-Oh, boo.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.494
"Ham and Egger" is an old boxing term

00:36.578 --> 00:38.663
for fighters who don't have
much left in 'em.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.915
Guys who agree to fight
just to earn enough for a meal.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.626
-Like ham and eggs?
-Exactly.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.295
I mean, that movie's
kind of a poor man's <i>Rocky, </i>right?

00:45.378 --> 00:46.838
Are you nuts, Bob?

00:46.921 --> 00:49.049
<i>The Ham and Egger</i>
is way better than <i>Rocky.</i>

00:49.132 --> 00:51.051
I have to admit I never saw it, Teddy.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.803
But didn't they have the song in it
called "Look of the Lion"?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.305
Yeah. What's your point?

00:55.388 --> 00:57.849
Well... (chuckles)
<i>Rocky III </i>had "Eye of the Tiger."

00:57.932 --> 00:59.517
A totally different animal, Bob.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.478
-Hmm. I mean...
-Just do yourself a favor,

01:01.561 --> 01:05.023
watch it tonight--
love, loss, blood, revenge.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.983
You had me at blood and revenge, Teddy.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.610
You know, I used to take boxing classes

01:08.693 --> 01:10.278
at the Y before you kids were born.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.906
<i>Y </i>did you stop?
(chuckles)

01:12.989 --> 01:15.158
-Did you accidentally
kill a guy in the ring?
-No.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.369
Did you accidentally
<i>pants </i>a guy in the ring?

01:17.452 --> 01:19.579
-How many fights did you win, all of them?
-Well...

01:19.662 --> 01:21.206
-20? Ten?
-Uh... it's...

01:21.289 --> 01:23.792
-Any?
-Okay, I never actually got in the ring.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.044
-What?!
-I only did it for a week, okay?

01:26.127 --> 01:27.921
I-I don't know why I brought it up.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.881
I didn't think you guys
would ask so many questions.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.966
Hey, Mike. Table for one?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.135
Just kidding, I know
you're just dropping off the mail.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.388
Mm-hmm.
It's funny every time you say that.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.515
-I know.
-You got a package today.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.394
(sing-songy):
Ooh, I bet it's the sheet masks
I ordered for "Spa-turday."

01:42.477 --> 01:44.729
-Gimme, gimme, gimme.
-Wait, there's a P in Saturday?

01:44.813 --> 01:47.649
(groans) This is like the D
in Wednesday all over again.

01:47.732 --> 01:49.859
No, it's Mom and Gene's weekly spa time.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.612
Every Saturday before dinner,
me and my Geenie Weenie

01:52.696 --> 01:54.948
get together for a little
mother-son pampering.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.616
Eh, I do that with my truck.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.160
We get in our swim suits,
put on some spa music,

01:59.244 --> 02:01.871
hop in the tub,
I vent to Mom about my week,

02:01.955 --> 02:03.665
and we just spa.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.917
And I definitely don't
pee in the tub even a little bit.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.419
Okay, then, so long.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.670
-You're welcome.
-Oh.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.338
-Uh, thanks, Mike.
-Yeah.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.048
Here, Linda. You got a letter.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.342
Ooh, it's from Janine
over at Yours Truly Stationery.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.177
Oh, it's happening.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.138
She's starting the group
for female business owners

02:18.221 --> 02:20.015
that she was talking about.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.225
"Inspiring local businesswomen
sharing stories

02:22.308 --> 02:24.185
of their challenges and successes."

02:24.269 --> 02:25.437
That sounds great, Lin.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.813
I know, I'm so excited.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.189
This group is made for me.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.483
I'm a woman and a restaura-saur.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.652
-A-A what?
-A restaura-saur.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.279
(chuckles)
It's-it's restauranteur.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.948
-What did I say?
-Restaura-saur, like dinosaur.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.908
-Well, Mom's way sounds cooler.
-Yeah.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.744
Yeah. Look at us Belcher girls.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.163
-Local businesswomen
sticking together.
-Rawr!

02:43.246 --> 02:46.541
<i>Business Woman Dinosaurs--</i>
I think that's a show on PBS.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.792
MAN:
Hey, string,

02:47.876 --> 02:49.919
<i>want to tangle?</i>

02:50.003 --> 02:52.714
<i>Oh. What? What'd I tell you</i>
<i>about punching the string?</i>

02:52.797 --> 02:54.507
<i>-Sorry, boss.</i>
<i>-What's the matter with you?</i>

02:54.591 --> 02:56.968
<i>-You think we can sell dented string?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

02:57.052 --> 02:59.220
So... he punches string?

02:59.304 --> 03:01.222
He's training,
he works in a string factory.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.599
It makes sense.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.767
Pretty cool his boss doesn't yell at him

03:03.850 --> 03:05.143
for having his shirt off, too.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.103
Look at him
showing those spools who's boss.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.646
Yeah, I pity the spools.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.191
This is just basically
the same exact story as <i>Rocky.</i>

03:11.274 --> 03:12.984
Should we just rent that?

03:13.068 --> 03:15.028
Sorry, Dad.
We're Ham and Egger kids.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.613
They're showing part two tomorrow--
you in?

03:16.696 --> 03:18.698
-Ham straight.
-I'm out.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.076
But remind me to show you
good movies sometime.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.579
Thank you, Janine.
I'll, uh, see you then, bye.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.123
Oh boy.
Gene's not gonna like this.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.833
Maybe I shouldn't do it.

03:28.917 --> 03:29.959
Do what?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.127
The businesswomen's meetings.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.170
They're during Spa-turday.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.005
Oh. Well, do you want to go?

03:34.089 --> 03:35.548
I really, really want to go.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.883
Then you should.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.802
Gene can handle it. I think.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.346
-Just do spa day on another day.
-Maybe.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.598
Hey, what if you tell
Gene I can't do Spa-turday?

03:43.682 --> 03:45.350
-Hell no.
-Right, right.

03:47.143 --> 03:50.230
-Gene?
-I'm not eating my secret brisket stash!

03:50.313 --> 03:51.648
No, that's not why I'm here.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.024
Oh. Then do you want some?

03:53.108 --> 03:54.234
No. No, thank you, Gene.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.027
Oh, well, maybe just a little. Mmm.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.737
It's good.
So, you know how I'm gonna do

03:57.821 --> 04:00.031
that inspiring women's
business people thingy?

04:00.115 --> 04:01.241
The future is female.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.701
Yeah it is.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.703
Well, it's once a week for six weeks

04:04.786 --> 04:06.371
-It's only six weeks.
-Uh-huh.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.289
And the meetings are on Saturdays
during our spa time.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.541
What?!

04:09.624 --> 04:11.543
The, uh... meetings are on Saturdays

04:11.626 --> 04:13.795
during our spa time,
and it starts tomorrow.

04:13.878 --> 04:14.879
No!

04:14.963 --> 04:17.340
You made me spit out secret brisket!

04:19.801 --> 04:20.927
LINDA:
All right,

04:21.011 --> 04:22.262
I'm off to my first meeting.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.848
Gene, are you sure we just can't move

04:24.931 --> 04:26.266
Spa-turday to tomorrow?

04:26.349 --> 04:27.726
Again with this, Mother?

04:27.809 --> 04:30.103
Spunday?
Do you hear how ridiculous that sounds?

04:30.186 --> 04:33.648
-Yeah, Mom.
-Besides, Sunday is "Mommy
and Me Salami and Tea" time.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.358
You guys keep a busy schedule.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.986
Gene, your father
has nicely offered to sub for me.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.362
You're not gonna miss a thing.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.614
Uh, yeah, I'm, uh, looking forward to it.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.950
I-I could use a deep scrub.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.244
Dad, do you even know
where your T-zone is?

04:46.327 --> 04:48.163
Uh, is that my tushy?

04:48.246 --> 04:49.039
Lucky guess.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.832
It's not gonna be the same.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.334
It'll be great.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.502
In a different, hairy dad kind of way.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.963
Okay, I'm off to the community center.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.131
Bye, everyone.
(smooching)

04:58.214 --> 04:59.215
Stay out of my room.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.260
Hello, Linda.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.553
Thanks for coming.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.138
Aw, thanks for having me, Janine.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.556
Women, women, women, go!

05:06.639 --> 05:07.974
So, eh, for our first meeting,

05:08.058 --> 05:09.392
we're all wearing stickers with our names

05:09.476 --> 05:10.727
and the name of our business.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.187
Go ahead and put on one

05:12.270 --> 05:14.481
-and have a seat.
-Okay.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.337
No, here.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.714
-(vocalizing)
-Uh, Linda?

05:39.798 --> 05:41.049
Huh? Oh, sorry.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.176
Sorry, just excited, go ahead.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.181
<i>Hey, Constance.</i>

05:48.264 --> 05:49.683
<i>Hiya, Ham and Egger.</i>

05:49.766 --> 05:52.310
<i>You look beautifuller than even last time.</i>

05:52.394 --> 05:55.146
<i>-Aw, no I don't.</i>
<i>-Here, I brought you something.</i>

05:55.230 --> 05:58.108
<i>-It's string.</i>
<i>-Yellow! My favorite.</i>

05:58.191 --> 06:00.318
<i>Nothing's too good for my best girl.</i>

06:00.402 --> 06:02.612
<i>-Okay, then, see you around.</i>
<i>-Oh, bye.</i>

06:02.696 --> 06:04.572
-Damn.
-I know all sequels are good,

06:04.656 --> 06:06.074
but this is amazing.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.492
Oh, you're still watching this?

06:07.575 --> 06:08.785
I feel like I failed you.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.995
Says the guy who probably
never got Mom string.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.664
And his nipples are out right now.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.291
GENE:
Father, Spa-turday has officially started.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.585
Coming.
<i>Rocky </i>rules, <i>Ham and Egger sucks.</i>

06:17.669 --> 06:18.878
-Get out.
-Wrong.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.175
Aah!
Sorry. I wasn't ready

06:24.259 --> 06:26.052
for the mask.
It's alarming.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.137
Here's yours.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.305
Great.
You and your mom were really, uh,

06:29.389 --> 06:30.724
excited about these things, right?

06:30.807 --> 06:31.975
That was a long time ago.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.101
I was a different boy then.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.185
Now I'm a man.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.770
Uh, okay. Here we go.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.897
-(grunting)
-Aah!

06:37.981 --> 06:38.898
Careful.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.734
Sorry. Okay, all right.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.652
I like the music.
What is that-- flutes?

06:42.736 --> 06:45.405
It's a Norwegian waterfall and pan pipes.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.866
Oh, look. They already
have eye, nose and mouth holes.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.493
-Great. I have all of those.
-Yep.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.579
So, you want to vent about your week?

06:52.662 --> 06:53.580
No thank you.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.040
You know, Gene, it's-it's good

06:55.123 --> 06:57.584
for your mom to do stuff for herself.

06:57.667 --> 07:01.004
Like, uh, for instance,
this women's business owners group.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.589
I know! Everything's fine!

07:02.672 --> 07:04.257
Gene, I-I think it's just important...

07:04.341 --> 07:06.801
Oh, wait, my mustache
is getting in the way.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.720
Maybe I should
try and tear a mustache hole?

07:08.803 --> 07:10.638
Oops, too much.
Let me just patch this up.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.140
Uh, uh-oh.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.434
Mom's mustache
wouldn't have been an issue, probably.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.810
But her eyebrows are.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.771
Anyway, I was just saying
I think it's important

07:17.854 --> 07:20.023
for your mom to get to do her own stuff.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.484
She's not just a mom, she's a person.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.195
If she's not just a mom,
then why is her name Mom?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.405
Well, she's also Linda.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.157
Sounds weird, but I believe you.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.409
And it's important
for me to do stuff like this.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.911
I didn't know
my face could feel this fresh.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.414
LOUISE:
Look at Ham and Egger go.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.375
That idiot Handsome Joe is gonna look

07:38.458 --> 07:40.919
more like What Happened to Your Face Joe
after this.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.337
Do you think that's all real sweat,

07:42.420 --> 07:44.047
or did they spray sweet,
sweet movie sweat on them

07:44.130 --> 07:45.340
to make them glisten like that?

07:45.423 --> 07:46.966
We should get really good at fighting.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.134
-We should?
-Yeah.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.594
It's our only ticket out of this dump.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.262
I mean, it's modest, but it's ours.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.931
And you never know when we'll have to face

07:53.014 --> 07:55.183
our own Handsome Joe
in a championship fight.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.476
Huh. Good point.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.977
Glisteny Handsome Joe.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.521
-Yeah.
-You know, if you want,

07:59.604 --> 08:00.897
I could teach you a few things.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.732
(laughs):
What? You? (scoffs)

08:02.816 --> 08:04.943
You've never even been in a fight, Tina.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.987
Yeah, but remember that time
I dreamt that I was fighting

08:08.071 --> 08:10.323
-that inflatable tube man
from the car dealership?
-No.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.617
Well, Dad came in to check on me,

08:12.701 --> 08:14.369
and I accidentally punched him in my sleep

08:14.452 --> 08:15.453
and he screamed and maybe cried a little

08:15.537 --> 08:17.455
even though he said he didn't.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.790
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.250
So? Huh?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.418
Okay, you can teach me.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.544
-Yes!
-GENE: Ow!

08:22.627 --> 08:23.962
-BOB: Sorry.
-You put a lemon slice

08:24.045 --> 08:25.714
on my eye instead of a cucumber!

08:25.797 --> 08:28.341
I got confused
by all the food in the bathroom.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.469
Lemons are for the water,
cucumbers are for the eyes.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.014
And salt and vinegar chips
are for the mouth.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.558
Hi, everyone.
How was Spa-turday?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.893
-Compromised!
-How-how was the meeting?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.520
Oh, it was amazing.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.814
Businesswomen supporting
other businesswomen.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.442
Networking, sharing experiences.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.193
I feel so... (grunts)

08:47.277 --> 08:49.362
You know? (grunts)
Do I look... (grunts)

08:49.446 --> 08:50.822
Do I look (grunts) to you, huh?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.699
Uh, yeah, you do, kind of.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.325
Well, I don't need your approval, mister.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.910
Just kidding.
I'll take it.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.454
Well, glad you enjoyed it, Mother.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.956
I did. I kind of feel like
doing one-armed pushups.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.334
Well, Spa-turday
was Blah-turday without you.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.754
Hey, maybe I can...
go to next week's meeting with you?

09:05.837 --> 09:08.590
Aw, Gene, that's sweet
you want to see what Mommy's doing,

09:08.673 --> 09:10.258
but it's for ladies only.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.594
No fair.
Women have it all.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.305
Aw, my poor sad little boy.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.723
I hate seeing him like this.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.808
I'm gonna go tell him
that I'm not gonna go

09:18.892 --> 09:21.603
to the meetings anymore
and that women are... stupid.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.563
Lin, no. Gene'll be okay.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.899
Right. Right.
Well, then I'm gonna go pee.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.734
A little came out
when I was thrusting before.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.944
<i>Let's go home, huh?</i>
<i>You did your best.</i>

09:30.028 --> 09:31.404
<i>Five... six...</i>

09:31.488 --> 09:32.739
<i>seven...</i>

09:32.822 --> 09:35.575
<i>I haven't done my best yet.</i>

09:37.702 --> 09:39.621
The music is weird.
Is the music weird?

09:39.704 --> 09:40.997
-No talking.
-Shush.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.083
I want to be that good, Tina.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.417
You're gonna have to train me harder

09:44.501 --> 09:45.877
than you've ever trained anyone.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.921
Including that first training bra you had.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.381
(exhales)
Okay.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.508
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>All right, kid.</i>

09:51.591 --> 09:52.926
We've been training all week for this.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.261
Lot of jump rope,
lot of shadow boxing our shadows.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.680
You ready to throw some punches?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.098
-Ready.
-Okay, I'll go first.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.475
Is that how it works?
We take turns?

10:00.558 --> 10:02.310
-I think so.
-Okay, bring it.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.229
Oh, boy.
Here comes the thunder!

10:04.312 --> 10:06.481
-Let's do it!
-Are you sure you want the full thunder?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.441
-Yeah.
-Maybe I'll just start
with a little lightning.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.859
Don't hold back, T, come on.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.361
Here I go!

10:11.444 --> 10:12.737
(sighs)
I don't want to hurt you.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.739
Tina, we're wearing pillows.
Bring it!

10:14.823 --> 10:16.950
Stop it, you two.
You're gonna break something.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.160
-I mean, not at this rate.
-Where's Gene?

10:19.244 --> 10:20.870
I got to say goodbye
before I go to my meeting.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.789
Gene?
Goodbye.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.544
Gene?
I'm heading to the meeting, so...

10:27.627 --> 10:29.212
I just wanted to say bye.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.923
And I love you.
And you're my precious angel.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.300
-Uh-huh.
-Can Mama get a little hug?

10:34.384 --> 10:38.388
Okay, fine,
a 45 to 65-second hug, but that's it.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.931
And I'm gonna smell you a little,

10:40.015 --> 10:41.766
but just remember that I'm still angry.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.060
-(sniffs)
-Oh, Gene. You know what?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.729
If you really want to come with me,

10:45.812 --> 10:47.188
-I guess that's okay.
-Yeah?

10:47.272 --> 10:49.733
Yeah.
I mean, it might be boring for you, but...

10:49.816 --> 10:51.484
Then I'll bring my homework
to do, quietly.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.069
I assume I have some.
I've never checked.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.654
And you got to be a good little boy.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.448
I'll be a regular Shirley Temple.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.159
Oh, you're doing that with our pillows?
Okay.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.744
-Tina, you can do this.
-Whoa.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.454
That's-that's not how you punch.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.414
All right, Gene's coming with me
to the meeting tonight.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.875
Just got to grab some stuff.
Uh, homework stuff.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.627
He's going with you?
So no Spa-turday?

11:09.711 --> 11:12.380
I mean, I could use a little exfoliating.
I think.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.798
I mean, we all probably could.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.051
Okay, time for a new trainer.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.261
Dad, you want to teach me and Tina
how to fight?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.805
You know, since you
used to go to a boxing gym for a week?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.599
-Really?
-Yeah. Turns out the only punch

11:22.682 --> 11:24.642
I'm good at is the Hawaiian kind.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.603
Actually, I'm not that good
at that, either.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.896
I put too much water in it.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.190
Uh, great.
I'll definitely show you some stuff.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.609
Hook. Jab. Uppercut.
Boom-boom.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.444
Just kidding.
Boom-boom's not real.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.945
-We know.
-This is gonna be fun.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.739
-Uh, let me go change.
-I'm ready.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.574
Okay, bye, my boxing babies.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.493
-Come on, Gene.
-Right behind you, Mama.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.245
Have fun at the businesswomen's
meeting, I guess.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.456
-Why do you want to go?
-To learn.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.875
(whispers): I'm not losing mom
to the cutthroat business world.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.585
What do you mean?
It's only six weeks.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.462
Yeah, but she'll get
all the tools she needs

11:52.545 --> 11:54.089
to climb the corporate ladder
and become president

11:54.172 --> 11:56.341
of all restaurants
and have to move to New York City.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.344
-Or Fort Lauderdale.
-Okay. So what's your plan?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.179
I'm gonna show Mom what she's missing.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.056
After tonight,
she'll want to quit that group

12:03.139 --> 12:05.016
and Spa-turdays will be back on, baby.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.143
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.479
I know.
<i>Great </i>idea, right? Bye.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.482
-I'm so smart, I'm so smart, I'm so smart.
-Um, uh, bye.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.696
Hi, everyone.
I hope you don't mind,

12:17.779 --> 12:19.072
my son Gene wanted to come and see

12:19.155 --> 12:20.490
-what this is all about.
-Hello.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.325
-Hi.
-Hello.
-Women only!

12:22.409 --> 12:24.703
Uh, Gene is just gonna
sit quietly and observe

12:24.786 --> 12:27.122
while he does some homework.
Right, Gene?

12:27.205 --> 12:28.498
You won't even know I'm here.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.792
Unless I sneeze or fart or sneeze-fart,

12:30.875 --> 12:32.627
in which case I'll say "excuse me."

12:32.711 --> 12:34.421
Okay, let's jump in.
Tonight we'll talk

12:34.504 --> 12:36.506
about how we can empower each other.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.384
Empowered Women Empowering Women.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.219
Or E.W.E.W. for short.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.762
Or maybe "ew, ew"?

12:42.846 --> 12:44.139
Oh, no, not that.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.974
Well, last week empowered this lady.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.726
I applied what we talked about.

12:47.809 --> 12:51.396
All that "grow change
to change growth" crap.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.398
You mean "you have to be open to change

12:53.481 --> 12:55.400
in order to grow and make change"?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.402
That's what I said.
I made a lot of change,

12:57.485 --> 12:59.571
and <i>we </i>made a lot of change.
Cha-ching.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.865
And I grew a lot.
As a person.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.867
The sex has never been better.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.660
Oh, that's... very good.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.370
GENE:
Sorry to interrupt, but can someone

13:07.454 --> 13:08.621
point me to the bathroom?

13:08.705 --> 13:10.373
I have to do something
that rhymes with soup

13:10.457 --> 13:11.666
and might have the same consistency.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.376
It's just down to the right.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.129
Hmm.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.923
So, it's not exactly a side of beef,

13:19.007 --> 13:20.717
but it's, uh, beef chunks.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.678
And the bag's thick,
so I think it'll be good to punch.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.430
I mean, I'd probably break it,

13:25.513 --> 13:27.432
-but you guys won't.
-Okay, big shot.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.851
Plus, beef is good enough
for Rocky, right?

13:29.934 --> 13:31.186
It's fine, if you have

13:31.269 --> 13:33.188
absolutely no giant spools of string.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.856
-We-we don't.
-You checked?

13:34.939 --> 13:36.066
I don't need to check, Tina.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.901
Come on, give it a go.
Punch the chunks.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.736
Okay, so like this?
(grunts)

13:39.819 --> 13:42.405
Oh, my God, no.
Are you closing your thumb in your fist?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.199
-Yeah.
-You can break your thumb that way.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.993
-It did hurt a little.
-And you got to keep your wrist straight.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.745
How's this?
(shouts)

13:48.828 --> 13:50.747
(chuckles):
No, no, that's not good.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.625
Uh, you don't punch with both hands
at the same time, Louise.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.086
But it's twice the punch, Dad.
(shouts)

13:56.169 --> 13:58.254
-No.
-I got the look of the lion.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.132
Oh, my God.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.300
<i>JANINE:</i>
<i>So, yeah,</i>

14:02.384 --> 14:04.386
I think we're realizing that some of us

14:04.469 --> 14:06.429
have a problem with being too nice.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.139
I have a huge freaking problem

14:08.223 --> 14:10.016
-with being too nice.
-(soothing music playing in distance)

14:10.100 --> 14:11.267
Wha-What is that?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.811
Oh, boy.
I'll, uh, I'll go check it out.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.521
You guys keep going.
I'll be right back.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.400
Hmm.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.235
What the...
What's going on?

14:20.318 --> 14:23.238
Gene, are you trying
to <i>Say Anything... </i>me with spa music?

14:23.321 --> 14:25.240
Oh, thank God you finally got here.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.617
I've been holding this thing up
for, like, 30 seconds.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.495
Anyway, since you're here,
how about some scented moisturizer?

14:30.578 --> 14:34.040
Gene, sweetie,
I need to go back to the meeting.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.793
But you seem so tense.
All those business issues.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.337
And the eucalyptus is <i>so </i>soothing.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.089
I mean, the eucalyptus <i>is </i>relaxing...

14:41.172 --> 14:43.675
But no.
No, I got to go back to the meeting.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.094
Ugh, I can't open it
'cause of the stuff on my hands.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.179
-Gene, open the door.
-Beauty mud.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.181
-No beauty mud.
-Yes beauty mud.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.851
-It firms and tones.
-Stupid lotion.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.686
Well, I guess you're trapped
with me here forever.

14:54.769 --> 14:57.731
-Did I say forever?
I meant for that to sound more casual.
-Gene!

14:57.814 --> 15:00.734
-Hah! Hah! Hah!
-Thumb out. Thumb out. Thumb out.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.777
Okay, okay,
let's stop for a second.

15:02.861 --> 15:06.406
I feel like both of you
are not listening to a word I'm saying.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.241
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We heard. One hand.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.409
Whatever.
I think we're ready to spar.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.662
-No, no. What? Wait. No.
-Yeah.
-Why not?

15:12.746 --> 15:14.664
Because you haven't learned any boxing.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.583
You may have actually gotten worse at it.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.294
Oh, great.
That's probably an intruder,

15:19.377 --> 15:21.755
-and we don't know how to fight.
-Puh. This is on you, Dad.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.715
I'm gonna give him the two-punch!

15:23.798 --> 15:25.133
Bob. It's me, Teddy.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.135
I-I can see you.
It's glass.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.970
Blink twice if you're being robbed.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.930
I was driving by, I saw your lights on.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.808
-Are you in danger?
-Don't worry, Teddy. Everything's fine.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.227
-It's not fine.
-Dad's scared to spar with us.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.104
He's supposed to be teaching us
how to fight,

15:38.188 --> 15:40.065
but all we're doing
is hitting beef chunks.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.858
Is "beef chunks"
what you're calling Gene now?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.651
-No. He's at his women's group.
-Got it.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.653
So, sparring.
That sounds fun.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.280
Can I spar?
We could call it "Spar-turday."

15:47.364 --> 15:49.616
-Like Linda and Gene's thing.
-You can fight with us,

15:49.699 --> 15:51.910
-but we're not calling it that.
-(Teddy groans)

15:51.993 --> 15:53.119
<i>GENE:</i>
<i>This would go easier</i>

15:53.203 --> 15:55.413
if you would just give in to the mud.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.499
-Ha!
-Damn it!

15:57.582 --> 15:58.500
You stay here, Gene.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.793
We'll talk about this later.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.544
Ugh.
I may as well leave this on.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.172
It feels like it's working.
I'm so mad right now.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.008
Oh, <i>you're </i>mad?
You're the one that abandoned Spa-turday.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.052
Our forefathers fought for this right.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.553
Now's not a good time.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.180
We will talk later.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.182
Hi, everyone.
I'm back. Sorry.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.184
Oh, now's not a good time?

16:16.267 --> 16:18.603
Well, when is a good time, <i>Linda?</i>

16:18.687 --> 16:21.564
-"Linda"?
-Yeah. You're a real person, apparently,

16:21.648 --> 16:23.692
so if you're not Mom, you're Linda.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.736
And I like Mom a whole lot more
than I like Linda right now.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.781
What's... on your face?

16:29.864 --> 16:31.032
-Beauty mud.
-Beauty mud.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.702
What is that mud made of?
It smells amazing.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.412
Kelp and magic.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.792
So you like Mom better than Linda
right now, huh, Gene?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.794
Yes.
Linda is a hardened businesswoman.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.213
Mom is a fun lady who pays attention to me

16:45.296 --> 16:47.757
and makes a hell of a DIY body scrub.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.467
I never should've let you come.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.261
I never should have let <i>you </i>come.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.471
-What?
-I've been far too permissive with you,

16:53.555 --> 16:55.098
and look where it's got us.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.934
-In a way, this is my fault, too.
-Aah.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.854
Is this part of the meeting?
Like a sketch or something?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.147
No.

17:02.230 --> 17:05.817
Okay, so remember:
thumbs out, wrists straight.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.111
-And float like a boat.
-Float like a butterfly.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.739
Right. Boats float.
Butterflies fly.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.574
It's in the name, but whatever.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.743
Okay, enough.
Less gab, more jab.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.162
Ow!
Son of a...

17:17.245 --> 17:18.163
-See?
-Yeah, Louise.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.372
Keep your wrist straight.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.373
(grunts)
Ow! Aah.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.541
I'm okay, I think.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.542
Oh, my God.

17:22.625 --> 17:23.960
Here, let me just show you.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.253
I'm dancing, I'm jabbing.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.713
Jab. Ow! Jab. Ow!

17:26.796 --> 17:29.299
-Cool.
-Did you hurt yourself, too? The expert?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.384
No. No, I'm not hurt.
I think it's just...

17:31.468 --> 17:32.677
sympathy pain for you guys.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.598
Admit it, Dad, you're hurt.
Worse than us.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.849
Well, I've worked up an appetite.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.768
Should we all take a break
and get a burger?

17:39.851 --> 17:41.644
I know a great place.
(chuckles)

17:41.728 --> 17:44.230
If Dad can even make a burger
with that bruised ego.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.316
I'm-I'm totally fine, Louise.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.735
(breathy, high-pitched):
Let's go make Teddy a burger.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.529
BOB (sighs):
That-That's not a pretty patty.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.698
It's got a good personality.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.909
-Ah. No, it doesn't.
-Funny how it's all lumpy,

17:55.992 --> 17:58.119
seeing how your wrist
is not messed up at all.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.038
Okay, fine. I hurt myself.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.915
Help me, Louise.
Will you cut the tomato?

18:01.998 --> 18:03.750
Tina, will you grab me a plate?

18:03.833 --> 18:06.002
How's that burger coming?
Perfectly round, I hope.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.296
Little worried about
what I'm hearing out here.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.422
Everything's under control.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.507
-(groans)
-Ow.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.633
Oh, that hurts.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.218
Nope. That's not gonna work.

18:13.301 --> 18:16.054
This is a disaster.
I never should have sparred.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.723
-I wasn't ready.
-Wait. What are you doing?

18:18.807 --> 18:20.558
I don't know.
Maybe dying.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.144
-I always knew it would end this way.
-I'm gonna die, too.

18:23.228 --> 18:26.064
(groans) I don't want to have
to drag your bodies out of here.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.816
How are we doing?
I can't see anyone.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.317
Wait a minute.
We're not gonna die.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.277
-We got to get up off the mat.
-We do?

18:31.361 --> 18:33.279
Yeah, we do.
Like Ham and Egger.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.448
Uh, okay.
Here we go.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.204
-(pained grunting)
-We can do this.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.747
Hey, I feel bad.
Forget it, right?

18:42.831 --> 18:43.832
You tried your best.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.209
We haven't tried our best... yet!

18:46.292 --> 18:47.419
Yes! Ham and Egger.

18:47.502 --> 18:48.920
(groans):
Still a bad movie.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.006
You're a bad movie.
Let's finish the job.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.096
(distorted): Lay him out!

18:58.179 --> 18:59.723
(distorted): Do it!

19:01.433 --> 19:03.476
-We did it!
-Yeah, we did.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.311
Here you go, Teddy.
We did it.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.563
That'll do, pig.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.356
Sorry, that's from a different movie.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.358
-Hmm. It's a little rare, Bob.
-ALL: What?!

19:10.442 --> 19:12.318
Nothing.
No. This is good.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.778
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>Gene, we can't keep talking</i>

19:13.862 --> 19:15.321
about this.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.866
This is a local businesswomen's
group, not our bathtub.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.285
Our bathtub isn't a place,
it's a state of mind.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.746
Look, Gene, I love
all the stuff we do together,

19:22.829 --> 19:24.622
pretty much every day of the week.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.999
Same here.
Let's keep doing

19:26.082 --> 19:27.667
those things together all the time.

19:27.751 --> 19:30.003
Honey, listen, being a mom is amazing.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.297
And being <i>your </i>mom is even more amazing.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.299
And I'll tell you something, I felt guilty

19:34.382 --> 19:36.343
about going to these meetings at first.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.386
I thought I needed permission to do this,

19:38.470 --> 19:41.514
but really, I just needed
to give <i>myself </i>permission.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.141
But I love you so much, Mom.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.934
Even though I'm upset with you right now,

19:45.018 --> 19:47.520
I still want you to rub my tummy
and play with my hair.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.981
I love you, too, Gene,
more than you could even know--

19:50.065 --> 19:51.816
not until you have your own kids.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.236
And also, I need a little time
for myself once in a while.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.822
-And that's okay.
-So what do you want me to do?

19:57.906 --> 19:59.574
Just let you do something for yourself,

19:59.657 --> 20:01.826
and I don't get to have you
every minute of every day

20:01.910 --> 20:04.412
-whenever I want?
-Oof. Cling-on alert.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.998
Okay, this does sound like it sounded.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.000
Oh, maybe I should just do th...

20:09.084 --> 20:10.960
that thing the group was talking about.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.213
What, take advantage
of the tax incentives offered

20:13.296 --> 20:14.881
to women-owned businesses?

20:14.964 --> 20:17.175
No, earlier tonight
when someone said something

20:17.258 --> 20:19.552
about having to change in order to grow.

20:19.636 --> 20:20.804
Me. That was me.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.056
I mean, it was me.
I had to correct you.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.058
I don't like change,
but I want you to be happy,

20:25.141 --> 20:26.685
and I do want to grow.

20:26.768 --> 20:29.771
I mean, not that fast,
but little bits here and there.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.399
And by the time I go to college
or deejay college,

20:32.482 --> 20:34.109
I'll only need to see you
five times a week.

20:34.192 --> 20:36.111
Aw.
Come here, sweetie.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.196
You'll always be
my special little Genie Beanie.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.115
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-Look at us.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.950
(chuckles):
We're getting mud everywhere.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.786
-Should we go home?
-No, no, finish the meeting.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.788
This time I promise I'll stay quiet.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.373
Thank you, Gene.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.208
Oh, well, that was inspiring.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.210
I got goose bumps.
Did anyone else?

20:52.293 --> 20:54.129
I have shingles.
Does that count?

20:54.212 --> 20:55.839
LINDA:
All right!
