<i>Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:05.005
Please let me
come back to the apartment.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.173
I don't want to be with
someone who can't trust me.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.041
It's me.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.209
Remember that kid who
lived with us for a while?

00:09.243 --> 00:11.211
The one that
everybody is looking for?

00:11.245 --> 00:12.179
One for the road?

00:14.115 --> 00:16.149
Amy is no longer
at the apartment.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.385
If I could get you a really, really
hot date, would you go out then?

00:18.419 --> 00:21.088
Who would I fix her up with?
That guy upstairs.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.323
No. No. No, no, no. He's a player.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.392
But you didn't say anything.
And I broke up with Jack.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.327
That has nothing to do
with me and Jesse.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.162
Yes, it does.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.198
I would have just hung in
there for a couple more weeks.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.300
You can't send naked pictures of my
daughter around to half the school

00:33.334 --> 00:33.900
and not go to jail for it.

00:33.935 --> 00:36.103
It's child pornography.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.206
Betty and I are splitting up.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.075
You ever pick up my phone, check
my messages, my emails, my texts?

00:43.277 --> 00:45.345
Did you tell Mom
that Nora is living here

00:45.379 --> 00:47.380
or am I just supposed
to be hiding that?

00:47.415 --> 00:49.149
If you're trying to get
back with your old boyfriend,

00:49.183 --> 00:50.217
what are you
doing here w with m?

00:50.251 --> 00:51.318
I thought it would
make him jealous.

00:51.352 --> 00:55.155
Let me be crazy for
you, don't go to Adrian.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.390
You need a little more
practice at being crazy.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.997
I hate that
I do this to myself.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.132
I mean, just last week,
all I wanted was for him

01:05.166 --> 01:08.068
to let me and John come
back to the apartment.

01:08.102 --> 01:08.568
And now that I have that, I want more.

01:08.603 --> 01:11.104
I always want more

01:11.139 --> 01:12.139
or better or different
than what I have.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.308
Well, welcome
to the human race.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.344
No, I'm sure that some
girls would be thrilled

01:17.378 --> 01:19.412
to be living with the
father of their baby,

01:19.447 --> 01:21.314
especially if the father
was anything like Ricky,

01:21.349 --> 01:24.151
and so caring,
and so helpful and...

01:25.419 --> 01:27.387
Hot.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.055
He's so hot!

01:29.457 --> 01:32.125
He is!
He's really hot!

01:33.394 --> 01:35.128
Some nights
I just look at him

01:35.163 --> 01:37.063
and I can't believe he's
looking back at me the same way.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.365
I know.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.267
I mean, you were that
nerdy French horn player

01:40.301 --> 01:42.135
who thought she'd never have a
boyfriend, and then you end up...

01:43.471 --> 01:45.172
I'm sorry.
Uh, where were you?

01:45.473 --> 01:48.175
Um, I was at...

01:48.209 --> 01:52.179
Okay, I know that I'm a lucky
girl to have Ricky in my life,

01:52.213 --> 01:54.314
but I want to be married.

01:54.348 --> 01:57.250
I want to know that Ricky
is going to be there for me

01:57.285 --> 01:59.252
and for John
for the rest of our lives.

01:59.287 --> 02:03.957
Well, getting married is not going
to guarantee that or anything else.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.358
I know that,
but it's what I want.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.262
I feel terrible
that I feel this way.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.233
I wish I didn't,
and I try not to,

02:13.267 --> 02:15.135
but honestly, Madison,

02:15.169 --> 02:17.070
it doesn't make me feel
too good about myself,

02:17.104 --> 02:19.206
after getting
pregnant at 15,

02:19.240 --> 02:21.241
to be living
with Ricky at 17.

02:23.144 --> 02:26.313
I'm not even sure it's better
than living with my parents.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.114
Not that my parents
are even living together.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.253
Once upon a time,

02:33.287 --> 02:36.356
there was a little boy who
wasn't much older than you,

02:36.390 --> 02:39.059
and he lived
with a wicked king

02:39.093 --> 02:43.296
who had a bad temper
and yelled and hit things.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.199
And the queen couldn't stop
him and she was afraid of him.

02:48.169 --> 02:52.339
So she did things to
make herself unconscious.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.306
Bad things.

02:53.341 --> 02:56.443
Like she did drugs
and she drank too much.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.946
So, one day,

02:59.981 --> 03:03.350
some people came and
took the little boy away,

03:03.384 --> 03:05.151
and he went to live
at another house,

03:05.186 --> 03:09.055
and then another house
and then another house.

03:10.091 --> 03:13.126
Finally,
a good king and queen

03:13.160 --> 03:16.229
rescued the little boy
and took him in.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.164
Unfortunately,
by this time,

03:18.199 --> 03:21.101
he was a little
rotten himself,

03:21.135 --> 03:23.103
and he had to learn
how not to be like

03:23.137 --> 03:24.104
the wicked king and
queen when he grew up.

03:26.073 --> 03:29.209
And when he was
16 years old,

03:29.243 --> 03:32.379
he met a girl at band camp
and he had a baby with her.

03:34.382 --> 03:37.050
But he didn't marry her,

03:37.084 --> 03:40.020
and she wanted to
get married so badly

03:40.054 --> 03:43.023
she was
driving him crazy.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.292
So, finally,

03:45.326 --> 03:47.260
he decided he wanted to
give her what she wanted

03:47.295 --> 03:50.997
because he loved her
so much.

03:51.032 --> 03:55.101
So, he went shopping
for a diamond ring.

03:55.136 --> 03:58.338
Not a big diamond ring,
a tiny diamond ring,

03:58.372 --> 04:01.274
the kind of diamond ring you can buy

04:01.309 --> 04:03.343
if you save your money
working at a butcher shop.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.350
A ring like this.

04:14.255 --> 04:17.089
Do you like it?
Do you like it, John?

04:17.124 --> 04:19.225
Yes.
I hope Amy likes it.

04:19.260 --> 04:23.029
You know who Amy is? Who is Amy?

04:23.064 --> 04:25.131
Mommy. Do you want me
to give Mommy the ring?

04:25.166 --> 04:26.266
No.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.367
Why not?

04:28.269 --> 04:32.972
Okay, well, I'm not going
to give it to her yet.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.240
I'm going to wait
and give it to her

04:34.275 --> 04:37.043
the night I graduate
from high school.

04:57.717 --> 05:00.699
OK, I'm going to go,

05:02.040 --> 05:04.449
Ricky wanted some time
to be with John tonight,

05:04.450 --> 05:05.728
And... I needed...

05:05.977 --> 05:07.878
But I've vented and now
And now i'm going

05:07.912 --> 05:10.047
to get Ricky to
ask me to marry him.

05:10.081 --> 05:11.915
How are you going to do that? Okay.

05:13.084 --> 05:15.085
Well, here's what
I'm thinking.

05:15.119 --> 05:18.855
I think I'll go by
Soda Fountainashioned

05:18.890 --> 05:21.825
and get Ricky histhat he lie

05:21.859 --> 05:24.061
the one with
and the sprinkles on top.

05:24.095 --> 05:24.962
And then, while he's
having his shake,

05:24.996 --> 05:28.765
I'll run a hot bath,
light some candles

05:28.800 --> 05:29.833
and then call him in
to take a bath with me.

05:29.867 --> 05:33.036
He thinks
I can be wild. d.

05:33.071 --> 05:36.006
And your idea of wild
and a bath?e shake

05:36.040 --> 05:37.808
Yeah, it's romantic!

05:37.842 --> 05:39.810
You already gave him
his only living son,

05:39.844 --> 05:41.845
you think
is going to top that? a bath

05:43.014 --> 05:45.048
Goodnight, Madison.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.851
I'm sorry,
it's just...

05:47.885 --> 05:49.786
You know, if he
won't marry you

05:49.821 --> 05:52.055
after all the things
through together,

05:52.090 --> 05:53.957
then he's not
because you give him

05:53.992 --> 05:55.826
a chocolate shake
and a bath.

05:55.860 --> 05:58.962
Shut up.
You don't know.

05:58.997 --> 06:01.765
Maybe I'll even wash his hair. Oh!

06:03.000 --> 06:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:11.009 --> 06:13.777
Okay. We should stop.

06:14.779 --> 06:18.048
Yeah, I guess
we should.

06:18.082 --> 06:20.817
It's just so nice
to be with you again.

06:20.852 --> 06:22.986
It's nice to be
with you, too.

06:23.021 --> 06:26.690
But we both know
you're going away to school,

06:26.724 --> 06:28.058
so, like you once
pointed out to me,

06:28.092 --> 06:29.893
we shouldn't do anything

06:29.927 --> 06:32.729
because chances are
we won't end up together.

06:32.764 --> 06:35.966
Well, as long as
we both realize that...

06:36.000 --> 06:37.934
Then what?
We should just do it?

06:37.969 --> 06:40.103
No. I can't.

06:40.138 --> 06:43.040
I just want to wait
and see how things go.

06:43.074 --> 06:45.876
All right, we can wait.

06:46.978 --> 06:49.746
But I really
did miss you,

06:49.781 --> 06:51.114
and you know how
much I care about you.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.984
And you know how much
I care about you,

06:54.018 --> 06:56.086
but I'm still not doing it.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.855
What if I decide to go to the
same school that Jack is going to?

06:58.890 --> 07:01.792
I haven't decided where
I'm going to school yet,

07:01.826 --> 07:03.894
but according to my counselor,
I should have lots of options.

07:03.928 --> 07:06.830
And I can't limit
my options to schools

07:06.864 --> 07:09.866
that are geographically convenient
to whatever school you go to.

07:09.901 --> 07:11.868
But I think you're missing
what I'm offering you here.

07:11.903 --> 07:13.770
I might be willing
to change schools for you.

07:13.805 --> 07:16.073
No, I know
what you're offering,

07:16.107 --> 07:18.975
and I don't want
that responsibility.

07:19.010 --> 07:21.678
If you change
schools for me,

07:21.712 --> 07:23.747
then what happens if I
change my mind about us,

07:23.781 --> 07:25.048
or if you change
your mind about us?

07:25.083 --> 07:26.917
Which you have before.

07:26.951 --> 07:29.786
So maybe we should
just live for today.

07:30.922 --> 07:33.757
Or tonight, anyway.
No.

07:33.791 --> 07:34.991
You're really good
at saying "no. "

07:35.026 --> 07:36.793
I've had a lot of practice.

07:36.828 --> 07:38.862
Don't you want your
first time to be with me?

07:38.896 --> 07:44.701
Yeah. I do, but that's what
I want right now, tonight,

07:44.735 --> 07:46.703
but in a year,
or the year after that

07:46.737 --> 07:49.039
I don't know what I'll want
then, and neither do you.

07:49.073 --> 07:51.908
So, let's just wait.

07:51.943 --> 07:55.979
Would it feel right
if I said I love you?

07:56.013 --> 07:57.781
Are you saying
you love me,

07:57.815 --> 07:59.749
or are you asking
if it would feel right

07:59.784 --> 08:01.852
to have sex if you
said you love me?

08:01.886 --> 08:02.686
I love you, Lauren.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.921
Oh my God, really?

08:04.956 --> 08:06.790
Really.
Do you love me?

08:09.760 --> 08:13.864
Yeah.

08:13.898 --> 08:15.866
Hey! Stop! Okay?

08:15.900 --> 08:17.701
But I love you.

08:17.735 --> 08:19.669
You know what?

08:21.038 --> 08:22.873
That was an "I want in
your pants I love you. "

08:22.907 --> 08:25.642
That was not
a real "I love you. "

08:25.676 --> 08:28.879
So I take
mine back. Goodnight.

08:29.814 --> 08:33.884
Oh, man.
I so screwed up.

08:39.724 --> 08:42.826
Jack?
Yeah, it's me, Madison.

08:42.860 --> 08:46.730
Look, here's the deal.
You were right.

08:46.764 --> 08:47.898
I am in love
with Grace,

08:47.932 --> 08:50.000
I am totally
obsessed with her.

08:50.034 --> 08:52.903
<i>But I can't have Grace</i>

08:52.937 --> 08:54.971
because Grace is with her
current boyfriend, Daniel.

08:55.006 --> 08:58.008
And as you know,
graduation is coming up

08:58.042 --> 08:59.609
and I don't want it to
be like the senior dance.

08:59.644 --> 09:02.612
I don't want to
ask Grace to go

09:02.647 --> 09:04.748
and have her
drag Daniel along again.

09:04.782 --> 09:06.783
So I'd like you
to go with me.

09:06.817 --> 09:08.685
And I hope you don't
think I'm being a jerk

09:08.719 --> 09:10.820
because I'm being
totally honest with you.

09:10.855 --> 09:14.925
And since you and I were
girlfriend and boyfriend for years,

09:14.959 --> 09:17.661
you think you could
possibly go with me,

09:17.695 --> 09:19.863
for old times' sake?
As a friend?

09:20.831 --> 09:22.666
Yeah.
You would?

09:22.700 --> 09:23.934
Really? Why?

09:23.968 --> 09:26.770
Because Lauren is
gonna be there with Jesse,

09:26.804 --> 09:28.972
and Amy's gonna be there with
Ricky and I want to go, too,

09:29.006 --> 09:30.941
even if it's just with you.

09:30.975 --> 09:32.943
And Grace isn't
gonna be there

09:32.977 --> 09:34.878
because she's not a senior,
so what do I care?

09:34.912 --> 09:37.948
Thanks, Madison. As Coach
would say, you're a team player.

09:37.982 --> 09:39.849
That's so romantic.

09:39.884 --> 09:40.951
Madison...

09:40.985 --> 09:42.852
I know. We're just
going as friends.

09:47.024 --> 09:48.725
Your phone is buzzing.

09:50.928 --> 09:52.896
It's Adrian.

09:52.930 --> 09:55.865
I know what this is about.
I've been avoiding her all week.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.767
That idiot never called her. What idiot?

09:57.802 --> 09:59.769
That idiot you fixed her
up with from upstairs.

09:59.804 --> 10:00.971
Dante is not an idiot.

10:01.005 --> 10:04.741
And hey, I didn't fix
her up. You fixed her up.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.076
I didn't want
anything to do with it.

10:06.110 --> 10:07.844
He said he would call her. Can't
you just get him to call her?

10:07.878 --> 10:10.013
No. I can't get
him to call her.

10:10.047 --> 10:12.048
If he doesn't call her,
he doesn't call her.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.783
Fine. Give me his number
and I'll get him to call her.

10:13.818 --> 10:14.985
He should be
ashamed of himself.

10:15.019 --> 10:16.953
Wait.
Did they do something?

10:16.988 --> 10:18.788
He took her upstairs
to get a better look

10:18.823 --> 10:20.824
at the canvas.
What do you think?

10:20.858 --> 10:21.992
That doesn't mean
that they did anything.

10:22.026 --> 10:23.827
You're so naive!

10:23.861 --> 10:25.729
She's so obsessed
with having him calling her

10:25.763 --> 10:26.997
I'm sure he took
advantage of her

10:27.031 --> 10:28.265
and now he won't even give her
the courtesy of a phone call.

10:28.299 --> 10:34.738
Did you say took advantage
or took her up on her offer?

10:34.772 --> 10:36.039
Whatever they did and whatever
they do is their business.

10:36.073 --> 10:38.108
It's not our business.

10:39.543 --> 10:42.078
Gotta go.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.917
Can you talk to him?

10:52.089 --> 10:54.691
Hi, Adrian.

10:54.725 --> 10:57.694
Grace, I've been calling you all night
because he still hasn't called me.

10:57.728 --> 11:00.830
Did you ask Daniel if he knows
why Dante didn't call me or not?

11:00.865 --> 11:01.931
He hasn't seen him.

11:01.966 --> 11:04.734
Can't he go and see him?
He lives upstairs.

11:04.769 --> 11:06.903
Do you really want
Daniel to ask him?

11:06.937 --> 11:09.739
I mean, doesn't that
sound sort of,

11:09.774 --> 11:11.041
you know,
high school?

11:11.075 --> 11:14.711
This guy's in college. I think
you should play hard to get.

11:14.745 --> 11:15.578
Well, it's a little
too late for that.

11:15.613 --> 11:17.847
You slept with him
on the first date?

11:17.882 --> 11:19.916
You slept with Daniel before
you even went on a date with him.

11:19.950 --> 11:21.918
And no, I didn't. We just
fooled around a little.

11:21.952 --> 11:24.888
Then why did you
bring up the fact

11:24.922 --> 11:26.756
that I slept with Daniel
before I ever went out with him?

11:26.791 --> 11:29.826
I don't know. I just felt like it
'cause I'm very upset about this.

11:29.860 --> 11:32.028
Grace, guys don't
not call me.

11:32.063 --> 11:34.664
Okay? This has
never happened before.

11:34.699 --> 11:35.665
And this isn't
good for my ego.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.867
He's probably just busy.

11:37.902 --> 11:39.936
With what?
Finals are over.

11:39.970 --> 11:41.838
I don't know, Adrian.

11:41.872 --> 11:44.674
It's bad enough that I can't
graduate with my class in two weeks

11:44.709 --> 11:47.677
because I lost my baby and I was
too depressed to go to school.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.679
I don't need this.

11:49.714 --> 11:50.914
I'm so sorry, Adrian.

11:50.948 --> 11:53.016
Does he know what
you've been through?

11:53.050 --> 11:55.919
Does he know that I lost
a baby? No. Not exactly.

11:55.953 --> 11:57.987
I let him think that I
thought I was pregnant

11:58.022 --> 12:00.623
but I wasn't.

12:00.658 --> 12:02.659
And okay,
it's a little weird

12:02.693 --> 12:04.661
that I got married
in high school

12:04.695 --> 12:06.830
and I'm getting a
divorce before graduation,

12:06.864 --> 12:09.966
but hey, that's no reason
not to call me again.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.901
I know, Adrian, but...

12:11.936 --> 12:14.771
But nothing.
I need this guy.

12:14.805 --> 12:18.007
Okay, well, if this
guy doesn't work out,

12:18.042 --> 12:20.009
then we'll
get you another guy.

12:20.044 --> 12:20.744
There are lots
of guys around.

12:20.778 --> 12:22.912
I like that one.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.918
Thanks again for the
chocolate shake, Amy.

12:28.953 --> 12:30.820
You're welcome.

12:30.855 --> 12:32.789
Someone is
looking for a proposal.

12:35.092 --> 12:37.660
You want to join me?

12:37.695 --> 12:39.662
Join you in the bath?

12:39.697 --> 12:40.964
It'll be fun.
I could wash your hair.

12:40.998 --> 12:44.033
Oh, my God.

12:44.068 --> 12:46.069
She is desperate.

12:46.103 --> 12:51.598
This could be fun.
Be right there.

12:53.077 --> 12:54.911
Till death do us part.

12:54.945 --> 12:57.914
Did you say something?
No.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.690
I can't believe it's almost
the end of our junior year.

13:08.725 --> 13:09.744
and then we're seniors!

13:09.778 --> 13:11.779
We're gonna be
seniors in high school.

13:11.814 --> 13:12.947
And a year from now, we'll be
looking at going off to college.

13:12.982 --> 13:15.984
Yeah.
So where are we going?

13:16.018 --> 13:18.786
Well... Wherever I can get into.

13:18.821 --> 13:20.822
Which is probably not
where you two can get into,

13:20.856 --> 13:22.924
unless I miraculously
ace the next SAT.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.993
Yeah, it's too bad
about that, huh?

13:25.027 --> 13:25.994
I choke on
standardized tests.

13:26.028 --> 13:28.863
I don't know
what it is.

13:28.897 --> 13:30.164
I start trying to figure
out how many questions

13:30.199 --> 13:33.835
and how much time and I divide
the time by the questions,

13:33.869 --> 13:35.837
and by then I've lost time
and then I divide again,

13:35.871 --> 13:36.938
and then I get panicked.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.907
Aw, I feel
so badly for you.

13:39.942 --> 13:41.976
You have to get over that. You
should take another SAT course.

13:42.011 --> 13:44.012
I've run out of them.

13:44.046 --> 13:45.980
I did the one at school, the
one at the community college,

13:46.015 --> 13:49.884
the one my dad paid a fortune
f at that private high school.

13:49.918 --> 13:53.154
And I saw a shrink that
deals with test anxiety.

13:53.188 --> 13:54.155
I don't think there's
anything else I can do.

13:54.189 --> 13:56.024
Don't worry about it.
We'll go where you go.

13:56.058 --> 13:58.826
Uh, I think we have
to go to whatever

13:58.861 --> 14:01.029
the best school is
that we can get into.

14:01.063 --> 14:02.864
Or I have to, anyways.

14:02.898 --> 14:03.798
Henry's just going to
have to conquer the SATs.

14:08.103 --> 14:09.904
Hi, guys.
What's going on?

14:09.938 --> 14:11.906
Hi, Mr. Boykewich.
Hello.

14:11.940 --> 14:13.908
What you got there?

14:13.942 --> 14:15.977
Oh, I just thought I'd bring up
some mini pizzas for you guys.

14:16.011 --> 14:18.012
I'm doing a little test
of a sausage we just sold

14:18.047 --> 14:20.782
to a nationwide pizza
company. Want a taste?

14:20.816 --> 14:23.718
Sure.
Sure.

14:23.752 --> 14:26.954
You're young people. I want
your opinion about this stuff.

14:26.989 --> 14:31.092
You probably eat more
pizza than anyone, right?

14:31.126 --> 14:31.926
What do you think?

14:31.960 --> 14:34.896
I think I've never
had you come up

14:34.930 --> 14:36.764
and ask my friends to test
out any products before.

14:36.799 --> 14:37.865
I had some time to kill.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.035
Well.
They're great.

14:41.070 --> 14:43.971
Yeah. But I'd go a little
thinner on the crust.

14:44.006 --> 14:46.040
I have nothing to do with the
pizza part, just the sausage.

14:46.075 --> 14:47.842
But I'll tell them
what you said.

14:47.876 --> 14:49.777
Oh, no, don't do that.

14:50.779 --> 14:51.779
Want another one?

14:51.814 --> 14:54.048
We've kind of been eating
junk food all night.

14:54.083 --> 14:57.085
Okay, well.
Staying over?

14:57.119 --> 14:58.820
No, we're going
over to Alice's.

14:58.854 --> 14:59.921
Want me to have
Mike drive you home?

14:59.955 --> 15:00.922
They're not ready
to leave yet, Dad.

15:00.956 --> 15:03.825
And I have my car.
But thanks, Mr. Boykewich.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.793
Sure. All right. Well.

15:05.994 --> 15:08.062
Goodnight.

15:15.971 --> 15:18.139
He's a little lonely
since Betty left.

15:19.975 --> 15:21.709
You have to find him
someone new.

15:21.744 --> 15:23.845
I need
to find me someone new.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.814
Oh, you'll find someone, but it's
kind of soon. You're still married.

15:26.849 --> 15:27.982
And next time
you meet a girl,

15:28.016 --> 15:30.852
I think you should rely on
our opinion a little more.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.887
You know, like your dad.
And Henry and I understand

15:32.921 --> 15:38.025
what it takes to make a good
relationship. Don't we, Hank?

15:38.060 --> 15:40.862
You guys wanna take home
the rest of those pizzas?

15:40.896 --> 15:43.798
No, thank you, but maybe
we should be going.

15:43.832 --> 15:45.767
Oh, don't let me rush you.

15:45.801 --> 15:48.069
Oh, no, of course not.
We have to get home anyway.

15:48.103 --> 15:48.836
Goodnight.
Night.

15:53.776 --> 15:55.143
What the heck is going on?

15:55.177 --> 15:58.713
What do you mean? Did you want
them to go for some reason?

15:58.747 --> 15:59.981
No, not really.

16:00.015 --> 16:01.883
Is there
something going on?

16:01.917 --> 16:03.751
Not that I know of, no.
Something going on with you?

16:06.855 --> 16:08.856
This is about
Camille, isn't it?

16:08.891 --> 16:11.893
Yeah.
Here's the thing.

16:11.927 --> 16:15.029
When do you think it would be
too soon to give her a call?

16:15.063 --> 16:16.964
It's never too soon.
You're a free man,

16:16.999 --> 16:19.700
you're just waiting
on papers, so call her.

16:19.735 --> 16:22.003
Should I call her?
Should I just show up?

16:22.037 --> 16:24.739
Should I send
her flowers first?

16:24.773 --> 16:26.808
Or maybe a nice piece
of jewelry or something?

16:26.842 --> 16:28.843
Jewelry? Dad, what are
you, Maurice Chevalier?

16:28.877 --> 16:32.113
Just call her,
or email her or text her

16:32.147 --> 16:34.782
and tell her that you and Betty
have gone your separate ways

16:34.817 --> 16:36.717
and you just
want to say hello.

16:36.752 --> 16:40.822
Well, I want to do
more than say hello.

16:40.856 --> 16:42.957
Well, you can do more than just
say hello and not buy her jewelry.

16:42.991 --> 16:46.761
She likes jewelry.
And I want her to like me.

16:46.795 --> 16:49.797
Like you? Dad, apparently she was
waiting for you all those years.

16:49.832 --> 16:51.799
I think she more
than likes you.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.836
Look, I went over there last
time with nothing more in my hand

16:54.870 --> 16:57.872
than a job offer
and I got my ass kicked.

16:57.906 --> 17:00.808
I don't want to go over there
without something this time.

17:00.843 --> 17:02.910
Okay, well, just don't
show up there,

17:02.945 --> 17:03.744
she might be dating
someone by now.

17:05.914 --> 17:08.849
There's no one she'd
like as much as you,

17:08.884 --> 17:10.785
but you have to
contact her first

17:10.819 --> 17:12.752
and find out if she wants
you to come over there,

17:12.788 --> 17:15.923
so send her flowers
and ask her to call you.

17:15.958 --> 17:18.826
That's not how a gentleman
behaves, asking a woman to call him.

17:21.096 --> 17:22.964
You think she would?

17:22.998 --> 17:23.998
I think she would.

17:26.801 --> 17:30.838
She's gonna drive all the way
back to Palm Springs tonight?

17:30.873 --> 17:33.908
She's gonna have to. I don't
wanna tell her you're here.

17:33.942 --> 17:36.911
You're going to let Anne
drive herself and the baby

17:36.945 --> 17:39.981
all the way back to Palm Springs
tonight? She does it all the time.

17:40.015 --> 17:42.083
And you don't think
it would be a better idea

17:42.117 --> 17:44.785
to tell her that
I'm living here,

17:44.820 --> 17:47.822
to give her the option of staying
here tonight, in her own house?

17:47.856 --> 17:49.857
No, this is way more fun.
It's our little secret.

17:49.892 --> 17:53.961
Okay, George, what if
something happens on the road?

17:53.996 --> 17:55.096
Then it's gonna
be my fault.

17:55.130 --> 17:57.098
No, it's gonna be her fault
for working so late.

17:57.132 --> 17:58.266
I can't tell
if you're joking

17:58.300 --> 18:00.868
or if you just have no idea
what civilized people do.

18:00.903 --> 18:04.772
Even I know that that's not
something someone should do.

18:04.806 --> 18:08.776
And I'm an alcoholic,
drug addict, ex-con.

18:08.810 --> 18:11.812
Look, this is my house until the
girls graduate from high school,

18:11.847 --> 18:14.015
and then Anne can do whatever
she wants with the house,

18:14.049 --> 18:15.116
she can rent it to me,
she can sell to me,

18:15.150 --> 18:18.686
she can live in it herself,
but tonight, it's mine

18:18.720 --> 18:19.820
and I don't want to tell
her that you're living here

18:19.855 --> 18:20.988
and I don't want
her staying here.

18:21.023 --> 18:22.990
I can't stay in her place,
so she can't stay in my house.

18:23.025 --> 18:23.791
Mmm-hmm.

18:25.961 --> 18:28.829
That's what it is.
I see.

18:28.864 --> 18:30.898
Okay. Well, I better get
out of here and hide

18:30.933 --> 18:32.833
in Ashley's room
before she gets here.

18:32.868 --> 18:34.001
She said it would
be another hour.

18:37.105 --> 18:40.074
Well, it wasn't. Hi.

18:40.108 --> 18:44.712
Hi. I'm George's ex-wife.

18:44.746 --> 18:47.815
I just came to get our
son. I'll go get him

18:47.849 --> 18:49.050
and get out of your way.

18:49.084 --> 18:52.753
He just ate, so he'll
probably just sleep in the car.

18:52.788 --> 18:53.921
Should be a pleasant
drive for you.

18:53.956 --> 18:54.989
Ow!

18:56.058 --> 19:00.661
Hi. I'm Ricky's mom. I'm Nora.

19:00.696 --> 19:04.966
I am gay and I am living here
as a temporary solution.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.835
Ricky's mom. Hi. Anne.

19:07.869 --> 19:09.870
Anne, it's so nice
to meet you.

19:09.905 --> 19:12.940
Were you jealous? Just for a
second there? Either of you?

19:12.975 --> 19:13.941
No.
No.

19:13.976 --> 19:16.944
Here. I packed his
stuff already. Goodnight.

19:19.982 --> 19:24.719
Okay. I think I'll just
go to my room now.

19:24.753 --> 19:26.654
Okay. You guys figure
out who's sleeping where,

19:26.688 --> 19:30.825
and, you know, if you need Ashley's
bed, I can sleep on the couch.

19:32.794 --> 19:33.794
So she's living here?

19:34.997 --> 19:36.797
Is she paying you
money to live here?

19:36.832 --> 19:37.999
No, she just
needs a place.

19:38.033 --> 19:39.800
She's been living with
Ricky's other mother.

19:39.835 --> 19:42.003
I know that. Did she get
kicked out for some reason?

19:42.037 --> 19:42.970
No, she did not
get kicked out.

19:43.005 --> 19:45.773
You know she's not
gonna have sex with you.

19:45.807 --> 19:47.675
I know that.
I know what a lesbian is.

19:47.709 --> 19:50.878
Right. So you know that
if she brings a date home,

19:50.912 --> 19:52.847
the two of them are not
going to have sex with you.

19:52.881 --> 19:55.016
They might.

19:55.050 --> 19:57.718
All right, well, if you wanna stay,
the other half of the bed is open.

19:57.753 --> 20:00.788
Sorry, Moose.

20:00.822 --> 20:03.858
No, I don't want to stay, but I don't
want to drive back to Palm Springs, either.

20:03.892 --> 20:06.694
I'm sick of driving here
and back. I'm exhausted.

20:06.728 --> 20:08.996
Well, Amy's room
is available.

20:09.031 --> 20:10.898
Good. Then you can sleep in Amy's bed

20:10.932 --> 20:12.933
and I can sleep in
my bed in my house,

20:12.968 --> 20:14.835
like I would have hoped
you would have offered.

20:14.870 --> 20:15.970
You don't let me
stay at your condo.

20:16.004 --> 20:16.937
You are such a child!

20:16.972 --> 20:20.675
Oops.

20:20.709 --> 20:23.778
Just coming back in.
I left my cell phone.

20:23.812 --> 20:24.812
And I couldn't agree more.

20:29.851 --> 20:32.053
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you had a long day

20:32.087 --> 20:33.854
and didn't feel
like being surprised.

20:33.889 --> 20:36.023
Believe me,
you're not the problem.

20:36.058 --> 20:37.892
And I've always
wanted to meet you,

20:37.926 --> 20:39.060
especially now that Amy
is living with Ricky.

20:39.094 --> 20:42.997
Yeah, and pushing him
to marry her. Oh, no.

20:43.031 --> 20:46.801
Is that what Ricky is saying?
That she's pushing him?

20:46.835 --> 20:48.836
Well, yeah,
but I don't think he minds.

20:52.774 --> 20:53.107
You know what I've
been thinking, Amy?

20:53.141 --> 20:54.809
No. What?

20:54.843 --> 20:57.778
That we really
should get married.

20:58.113 --> 21:00.715
Really?

21:00.749 --> 21:03.818
Yeah. When we both
graduate from college,

21:03.852 --> 21:05.953
and we have jobs and we're more
settled, we should get married.

21:05.987 --> 21:06.087
Um, yeah.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.826
Yeah, that sounds good.

21:11.860 --> 21:15.029
I mean, good
and kind of vague.

21:15.063 --> 21:16.731
Could you be more vague?

21:16.765 --> 21:18.999
That wasn't vague.
That was very specific.

21:19.034 --> 21:20.735
That would be
five years from now.

21:20.769 --> 21:23.070
We should make a five-year
plan and stick to it.

21:25.006 --> 21:27.908
Five years will
go by like that.

21:27.943 --> 21:30.711
Especially if every night
is like tonight.

21:33.915 --> 21:35.783
My neck is a little stiff
from holding my head back

21:35.817 --> 21:37.952
when you were
shampooing my hair.

21:37.986 --> 21:39.987
Would you mind
giving me a massage?

21:41.089 --> 21:43.858
Um. Okay. Sure.

21:59.588 --> 22:02.325
Even if I can't get into
school that your'e...

22:02.441 --> 22:04.609
my parents wouldn't have
the money for me to go.

22:04.643 --> 22:07.345
There are five kids
in my family.

22:07.379 --> 22:08.379
I'd have to
get a scholarship,

22:08.414 --> 22:10.415
and I don't think there's
any chance of that.

22:10.449 --> 22:11.682
Let's not worry about
things that haven't happened.

22:12.651 --> 22:15.553
It's just that...

22:15.587 --> 22:17.422
I'm starting to feel a
little guilty about the sex.

22:17.456 --> 22:18.689
What?

22:18.724 --> 22:20.525
I mean, we both see the
possibility of this not lasting,

22:20.559 --> 22:22.493
yet we keep
having sex.

22:22.528 --> 22:24.395
Really good sex.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.597
Well, now that you've said that,
it's not going to be good sex.

22:26.632 --> 22:29.700
And I can't see the
possibility of us not lasting,

22:29.735 --> 22:31.602
or I couldn't until you
started talking like this.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.474
You're not
sabotaging the SATs

22:36.508 --> 22:38.509
just to not get into
a good college, are you?

22:38.544 --> 22:40.411
Are you trying
to get away from me?

22:40.446 --> 22:42.580
Alice,

22:42.614 --> 22:43.614
we've been together
since the third grade.

22:43.649 --> 22:46.484
And?
And

22:46.518 --> 22:51.456
if we take a break after next
year and go to different colleges,

22:51.490 --> 22:52.757
then, I don't know,

22:52.791 --> 22:55.526
that might be
good for us.

22:55.561 --> 22:59.530
I may even want to travel for a
year or two before I go to college.

22:59.565 --> 23:01.666
Henry, you are not breaking
up with me at school, are you?

23:01.700 --> 23:02.633
I said take a break,
not break up.

23:02.668 --> 23:06.270
Take a break,
and not for another year.

23:06.305 --> 23:08.506
You coward!

23:08.540 --> 23:10.408
You don't
want to be with me,

23:10.442 --> 23:12.510
so you're going to wait until
we get into different colleges

23:12.544 --> 23:14.645
and then use that
as an excuse?

23:14.680 --> 23:15.413
Just forget
I said anything.

23:17.649 --> 23:19.350
Alice.

23:23.355 --> 23:24.655
Sorry, couldn't
find parking.

23:24.690 --> 23:25.423
Where's Alice going?

23:29.328 --> 23:30.595
Henry?

23:30.629 --> 23:33.331
I think I'm gonna
throw up. What's wrong?

23:33.365 --> 23:33.598
Alice thinks
I broke up with her.

23:33.632 --> 23:35.366
Why?

23:37.402 --> 23:39.303
Did you?
No.

23:39.338 --> 23:40.605
If we break up,
it'll be next year,

23:40.639 --> 23:42.540
after we both graduate
and go our separate ways.

23:42.574 --> 23:47.545
But just last night, we were talking
about all going to college together

23:47.579 --> 23:49.514
if you can do a little
better on the SATs.

23:51.350 --> 23:55.319
Oh, no. You don't want to
take the SATs again, do you?

23:55.354 --> 23:57.388
I just can't.
I can't do it!

23:57.422 --> 23:59.490
You don't understand the
pressure of being Filipino.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.493
Your family places a lot of
importance on the SATs?

24:02.528 --> 24:03.461
And on grades.
And on college.

24:03.495 --> 24:06.531
And on marrying
someone they approve of.

24:06.565 --> 24:08.366
They don't
approve of Alice?

24:08.400 --> 24:10.234
No, they do.

24:10.269 --> 24:12.436
They'd like to see
us get married.

24:12.471 --> 24:15.339
And "like to see us" means
you're expected to, and Ben...

24:16.675 --> 24:19.544
She's the only girl
I've ever even kissed.

24:19.578 --> 24:20.444
Oh, Henry.

24:20.479 --> 24:24.248
When I graduate,
I wanna see the world.

24:24.283 --> 24:27.385
I wanna go places, experience
new things with new women.

24:27.419 --> 24:30.621
What made you start
thinking this way?

24:30.656 --> 24:33.324
I think it was either when you got
pregnant or married or filed for divorce.

24:35.394 --> 24:37.461
He called last night and I'm
going to graduation with him

24:37.496 --> 24:41.299
and everything
graduation-related.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.401
You know, I agreed
to go as his date,

24:43.435 --> 24:45.436
as a friend
who knows that

24:45.470 --> 24:46.537
he doesn't love me.
He loves Grace.

24:47.406 --> 24:49.607
Why?
Why would you do that?

24:49.641 --> 24:51.642
Well, because I thought
Lauren was going with Jesse,

24:51.677 --> 24:54.378
and you'd be there with Ricky
and we'd all have a good time.

24:54.413 --> 24:55.613
It's just an agreement.
I mean, we both agreed.

24:55.647 --> 24:59.550
You have absolutely zero
self-esteem, you know that?

24:59.585 --> 25:01.452
Well, look where
your self-esteem got you!

25:01.486 --> 25:02.420
Madison!
And you!

25:02.454 --> 25:04.555
I don't see a ring
on your finger.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.524
Chocolate shake and a bath
didn't work out? Huh?

25:06.558 --> 25:10.361
What? I'm trying to
get Ricky to marry me.

25:10.395 --> 25:13.264
And, by the way, he did
say he would marry me. When?

25:13.298 --> 25:16.500
When we get out of college and
we get a job and we get settled.

25:16.535 --> 25:19.570
Then he asked me
to massage his neck.

25:19.605 --> 25:20.271
And you did,
didn't you?

25:20.305 --> 25:22.607
Yes. I did.
It made him happy.

25:22.641 --> 25:24.442
What is he gonna do
to make you happy?

25:24.476 --> 25:26.444
I am happy. That's why
I wanna get married.

25:26.478 --> 25:28.446
Amy, you're
in high school.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.348
And I'm living with him
and our son.

25:32.317 --> 25:33.484
Excuse me, Lauren?

25:35.320 --> 25:46.464
Could we talk?

25:46.498 --> 25:49.266
Can wealk? You sure you don't
want to do more than talk?

25:49.301 --> 25:51.502
I apologize. It's not
like me to be so pushy,

25:51.536 --> 25:55.573
but it's not like you
to go past first base,

25:55.607 --> 26:00.244
so I thought I could, you
know, go for a home run.

26:00.278 --> 26:01.412
I misread the signals.

26:01.446 --> 26:03.514
That's ridiculous.
I know. I know it is,

26:03.548 --> 26:06.517
and I know I got
too pushy and I blew it.

26:06.551 --> 26:10.421
But please, Lauren, it won't
happen again. I promise.

26:10.455 --> 26:13.190
I can hear the
word "no. " I can.

26:13.225 --> 26:14.425
You couldn't last night.

26:14.459 --> 26:15.393
I really do love you.

26:18.597 --> 26:21.499
Lauren?
I was just joking.

26:22.300 --> 26:22.333
Lauren!

26:27.272 --> 26:28.472
I don't think I'm doing
that. No. Not intentionally.

26:28.507 --> 26:32.576
Adrian, I just think it was too
soon for you to go out again.

26:32.611 --> 26:35.379
RRIt was too soon for
you to even meet Dante.

26:35.414 --> 26:37.348
It should not be
this big of a deal

26:37.382 --> 26:39.417
if a guy doesn't call you back
after he went out with you.

26:39.451 --> 26:41.585
That just happens sometimes.

26:41.620 --> 26:46.257
It just feels bad because
you're so vulnerable right now.

26:46.291 --> 26:48.292
Look, I'm sorry. I know I said
I'd find out why he didn't call,

26:48.326 --> 26:49.527
but I'm not going to.

26:49.561 --> 26:53.364
I am not going to
help you look desperate.

26:53.398 --> 26:54.632
That's how this looks.

26:54.666 --> 26:57.435
And you don't do
desperate. You're Adrian.

26:57.469 --> 26:59.437
You should
think about that.

27:09.314 --> 27:11.182
Oh Adrian, come in.

27:11.216 --> 27:12.516
I'm just getting paperwork
done for all the...

27:12.551 --> 27:13.551
Graduates?

27:14.653 --> 27:17.455
Yeah. Which you will be,
too. At the end of summer.

27:17.489 --> 27:20.291
I have to graduate
with my class. I have to.

27:20.325 --> 27:23.227
I have been
rough way too much

27:23.261 --> 27:25.529
not to get to graduate with all
the students I started school with.

27:25.564 --> 27:28.466
Please, please,
there has to be a way.

27:28.500 --> 27:32.369
I just lost a baby.
My marriage is breaking up.

27:32.404 --> 27:34.405
And the guy I went out with
last week isn't returning

27:34.439 --> 27:36.373
any of my calls
or text messages.

27:36.408 --> 27:39.343
You went out with a guy?
On a date?

27:39.377 --> 27:41.412
Are you and Ben
even divorced?

27:41.446 --> 27:44.482
What's a divorce?
We're done. It's over.

27:44.516 --> 27:49.220
I have to be at that graduation
ceremony in a cap and gown.

27:49.254 --> 27:53.390
Please, please, please, appeal
to whoever you have to appeal to

27:53.425 --> 27:54.558
to get me on that stage.

27:54.593 --> 27:57.194
I'll go to the
classes this summer.

27:57.229 --> 27:59.196
I'll finish whatever
work I have to do.

27:59.231 --> 28:00.264
I just want
to be with Ricky.

28:02.167 --> 28:04.268
I mean, Ricky and Jack
and all of my friends.

28:06.571 --> 28:10.541
Surely, you can find
some way to allow me

28:10.575 --> 28:14.278
this one happiness
after all I've been through.

28:17.516 --> 28:19.517
I'll try.

28:21.319 --> 28:24.488
Thank you.
I know you can do it.

28:31.229 --> 28:32.396
Oh, oops!

28:32.430 --> 28:34.365
Yeah, like that
wasn't intentional.

28:34.399 --> 28:36.267
It wasn't intentional.

28:36.301 --> 28:39.403
Fine. Two more weeks and no chance
of this ever happening again.

28:39.437 --> 28:41.372
Uh, yeah, there is.

28:41.406 --> 28:43.407
Don't forget. I got into the
same college you got into.

28:43.441 --> 28:47.344
I forgot. But you
still have to graduate.

28:47.379 --> 28:50.247
Yes, but the counselor
just told me that I might

28:50.282 --> 28:52.183
get to go to the graduation
with all the rest of you.

28:52.217 --> 28:52.683
I'll just have to finish my
requirements this summer.

28:52.717 --> 28:54.285
Whatever.
Wait!

28:54.519 --> 28:57.354
Slow down!

28:57.389 --> 28:59.423
Can't you even have a normal
conversation with me?

28:59.457 --> 29:02.226
I'm not after you.
I have a boyfriend.

29:02.260 --> 29:04.228
You have a boyfriend?
Does your husband know?

29:04.262 --> 29:06.363
Um, my soon
to be ex-husband.

29:06.398 --> 29:10.267
And it's none of his
business. And he doesn't care.

29:10.302 --> 29:12.269
Do you care? No, Adrian, I really don't.

29:12.304 --> 29:13.470
I'm really
in love with Amy.

29:13.505 --> 29:17.208
Well, you're not
married to Amy, are you?

29:17.242 --> 29:18.008
No.

29:18.043 --> 29:20.277
And you're not
engaged, are you?

29:20.312 --> 29:21.412
No.

29:21.446 --> 29:22.513
Then you're still
technically available.

29:22.547 --> 29:25.349
Not for long.

29:38.926 --> 29:41.762
Come in.

29:41.796 --> 29:45.999
Oh! Oops. Sorry, wrong apartment.
I was looking for Daniel.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.836
Oh. No. Right apartment.
Daniel's not here.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.106
Oh. I didn't know
he had a roommate.

29:53.141 --> 29:54.107
A good-looking roommate.

29:55.009 --> 29:58.779
You're half right.
I am good-looking,

29:58.813 --> 29:59.880
but no, he doesn't
have a roommate.

29:59.914 --> 30:03.116
I live upstairs. I was
just borrowing some food.

30:03.151 --> 30:04.985
Or going to.
Nothing here.

30:05.019 --> 30:07.988
Oh, you live upstairs? I know
someone who lives upstairs.

30:08.022 --> 30:09.056
Who's that?

30:09.090 --> 30:10.957
Oh, just some guy.

30:10.992 --> 30:12.793
Some really rude,
obnoxious guy named Dante.

30:12.827 --> 30:14.895
Do you know him?

30:14.929 --> 30:15.962
Kind of.

30:15.997 --> 30:18.031
Yeah, well,
we went out,

30:18.066 --> 30:20.967
and I thought we hit it off,
but apparently he was faking it.

30:21.002 --> 30:22.803
I haven't heard from him.

30:22.837 --> 30:23.937
Look, you haven't seen
him around, have you?

30:23.971 --> 30:26.039
No. He took off when he
finished his last final.

30:26.074 --> 30:29.910
He's backpacking across
Europe with some guys.

30:29.944 --> 30:32.145
I knew it! I knew there had to be a
good reason why he hadn't called me.

30:33.214 --> 30:35.115
Well, he could
have called you.

30:35.149 --> 30:38.785
I mean, it was last minute,
but he could have called you.

30:38.820 --> 30:39.886
Especially since you're going
through a divorce and all.

30:41.789 --> 30:45.926
Oh, yeah, he told me.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.127
You're Adrian,
aren't you?

30:47.161 --> 30:49.029
Yeah. And you are?

30:49.063 --> 30:50.163
Omar.

30:51.165 --> 30:53.100
His brother.
Yep.

30:54.135 --> 30:55.869
Oh.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.872
Oh.

31:02.810 --> 31:04.010
Hey, your dad
let me in.

31:04.045 --> 31:04.845
You didn't tell him we were
seeing each other again?

31:04.879 --> 31:08.782
No, because
I thought about it,

31:08.816 --> 31:12.085
and I don't want to go to
any graduation stuff with you.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.921
Lauren's right.

31:14.956 --> 31:19.025
The only reason I'm doing it is
because I have zero self-esteem

31:19.060 --> 31:21.795
and I probably would have
ended up sleeping with you, too,

31:21.829 --> 31:23.830
so I changed my mind.

31:23.865 --> 31:27.000
Wait a minute, you can't just
change your mind. You're my friend.

31:27.034 --> 31:28.034
No, not really.

31:28.069 --> 31:31.071
I mean, not that
good a friend.

31:31.105 --> 31:33.740
I mean, I don't, like, mind talking to
you in the hallway and stuff like that,

31:33.775 --> 31:35.075
but I don't wanna
go out with you.

31:35.109 --> 31:37.744
Madison, come on, I can't
go through graduation solo.

31:37.779 --> 31:39.980
No, you can.
And you should.

31:40.014 --> 31:41.081
You deserve to go solo.

31:41.115 --> 31:42.883
Don't be like that.
Next year,

31:42.917 --> 31:44.751
if you don't have a
boyfriend, I'll do it for you.

31:44.786 --> 31:46.853
Next year, if I don't
have a boyfriend? Ha!

31:46.888 --> 31:48.755
I'm gonna have
a boyfriend.

31:48.790 --> 31:49.890
You don't have
a boyfriend right now.

31:49.924 --> 31:51.958
I will have a boyfriend
by this time next year.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.027
Okay, well, I don't have a
girlfriend this time this yea

31:54.061 --> 31:56.730
Okay? So please.
No.

31:56.764 --> 31:59.099
But Lauren and Jesse and Amy
and Ricky are gonna be there.

31:59.133 --> 32:01.001
Lauren broke up with Jesse.

32:01.035 --> 32:03.904
Oh, so that's it. It had nothing
to do with being a friend to me.

32:03.938 --> 32:05.839
I told you that.
No, you didn't.

32:05.873 --> 32:07.808
No, I did.

32:07.842 --> 32:09.075
Madison, after all the
time we spent together,

32:09.110 --> 32:09.810
and all the things
we did together,

32:09.844 --> 32:12.145
you can't just
do this for me?

32:12.180 --> 32:13.847
I really need you.

32:13.881 --> 32:15.916
No, you need
to get over Grace.

32:15.950 --> 32:17.951
And once
you get over Grace,

32:17.985 --> 32:21.121
if I'm still around and I
haven't found that boyfriend,

32:21.155 --> 32:24.758
then, maybe, I'll think about
going out with you as a friend.

32:24.792 --> 32:24.891
But not now.

32:26.994 --> 32:28.895
No.

32:31.065 --> 32:34.701
Can you say, "Idiot?"
Say, "Idiot. "

32:34.735 --> 32:37.070
I want to be reminded
every day that I'm an idiot.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.810
Hi.
Hi.

32:45.112 --> 32:46.880
Sorry to surprise
you like this.

32:48.816 --> 32:50.851
No, no,
nice surprise.

32:52.086 --> 32:53.954
Come in.

32:53.988 --> 32:56.756
What's going on?

32:56.791 --> 32:58.859
Well, first of all,
you're not an idiot.

33:00.161 --> 33:02.095
Okay, maybe
just a little bit.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.832
But, I thought about it,

33:05.867 --> 33:07.767
and I guess a guy
can make a mistake

33:07.802 --> 33:08.835
and learn from
that mistake, right?

33:08.870 --> 33:12.772
If you're talking
about me, yeah.

33:12.807 --> 33:15.008
And I will never make
the mistake of pushing you

33:15.042 --> 33:17.110
to do anything
you don't wanna do.

33:17.144 --> 33:20.847
Never, never again.
I swear.

33:20.882 --> 33:22.782
All right.
Really?

33:22.817 --> 33:23.083
All right?

33:23.117 --> 33:24.985
Yeah.

33:26.821 --> 33:28.121
I'm kind of afraid
to say it again.

33:28.956 --> 33:29.890
Don't be.

33:30.892 --> 33:32.092
I love you.

33:32.126 --> 33:33.126
Thanks.

33:35.763 --> 33:37.764
I love you, too.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.041
Do you wanna
get that?

33:48.075 --> 33:49.776
No. I'm su
it's just Madison.

33:55.049 --> 33:58.818
Hey! It's me, Madison.
The new Madison.

33:58.853 --> 34:00.854
Madison with self-esteem.

34:00.888 --> 34:02.722
I told Jack no.

34:02.757 --> 34:03.523
It wasn't easy,
but I did it.

34:03.558 --> 34:04.991
And I feel really
good about it.

34:05.026 --> 34:07.961
So, maybe,
graduation night,

34:07.995 --> 34:08.895
you and me,
we can go do something.

34:08.929 --> 34:11.998
Go look for guys
together or something.

34:12.033 --> 34:14.868
Um, okay. Call me.

34:14.902 --> 34:16.069
I mean,
it wasn't too weird,

34:16.103 --> 34:17.871
the senior dance, right?
We had fun.

34:19.806 --> 34:22.909
So, maybe you two would wanna
go to graduation with me.

34:22.944 --> 34:25.745
I mean, Daniel, you didn't even
get to go to your own graduation

34:25.780 --> 34:26.880
because you graduated early.
Maybe you'd enjoy going?

34:26.914 --> 34:29.783
Are you asking me
out on a date?

34:29.817 --> 34:31.751
Jack.
I can't go by myself.

34:31.786 --> 34:32.585
Your parents
are gonna be here.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.054
That has loser
written all over it.

34:34.088 --> 34:37.023
And taking your ex-girlfriend
and her boyfriend wouldn't?

34:37.058 --> 34:38.925
I'm desperate.
Then ask Madison.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.994
Maybe she'd go with you.
She already said no.

34:41.027 --> 34:44.030
Then find somebody else. There
are tons of girls out there, Jack.

34:44.065 --> 34:46.967
I can't just ask someone new to
something important like that.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.002
Yeah, you can.

34:49.036 --> 34:50.837
It's a night I'm gonna remember
for the rest of my life.

34:50.871 --> 34:51.670
Years from now, I'm gonna look
back at the pictures and say,

34:51.706 --> 34:53.806
"Who is that random girl?"

34:53.841 --> 34:54.841
The girl you took
to graduation.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.076
Fine. Forget it.

34:58.779 --> 34:59.879
He's a nut.

35:01.048 --> 35:04.818
Oh, no. No. You're not
feeling sorry for him, are you?

35:04.852 --> 35:08.822
Well, it's his senior
year, and I don't know...

35:08.856 --> 35:10.890
Okay, Grace, that's it.

35:10.925 --> 35:12.092
I can't deal with your
friends and all their issues.

35:12.126 --> 35:13.760
What?

35:13.794 --> 35:15.929
I'm crazy about you. I am.

35:15.963 --> 35:17.764
And if you want to have
a relationship with me,

35:17.798 --> 35:19.799
it's gotta be
just you and me.

35:19.834 --> 35:22.002
Not you and me and
Adrian and the neighbors.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.737
Or you and me and Jack.

35:23.771 --> 35:25.939
Or you and me
and your mother.

35:25.973 --> 35:30.148
It's gotta be
just you and me.

35:48.364 --> 35:51.232
Alice, are you okay?

35:51.267 --> 35:55.003
Yeah, thanks,
Mr. Boykewich.

35:55.037 --> 35:57.205
I'm just waiting on Ben to
get home. If you don't mind.

35:57.239 --> 36:00.342
No. No, I don't mind.

36:04.180 --> 36:06.314
Henry broke up with me.

36:06.349 --> 36:09.384
What? You two have
been together forever.

36:09.418 --> 36:12.053
I know. But when
we go to college,

36:12.088 --> 36:14.122
he wants to go
to separate colleges.

36:14.156 --> 36:14.422
That's a whole
year away from now.

36:14.457 --> 36:16.291
I know.

36:16.325 --> 36:20.228
He broke up with me
a year in advance.

36:20.262 --> 36:25.266
He just ruined my senior
year. Maybe even my life.

36:25.301 --> 36:29.004
Don't cry, Alice.
It'll be okay.

36:29.038 --> 36:31.006
I'll find Ben for you
and get him over here.

36:31.040 --> 36:35.110
It's just that I've never
dated anyone else.

36:35.144 --> 36:37.178
I'm gonna have
to start all over.

36:37.213 --> 36:39.280
I don't wanna
start all over.

36:39.315 --> 36:43.251
I want Henry.
And Henry doesn't want me.

37:14.183 --> 37:19.087
"Would you mind calling me? I would
really like to talk to you. Love, Leo. "

37:26.095 --> 37:28.096
I'll have
the usual.

37:28.130 --> 37:31.099
I'll just have
some bread. Thanks.

37:32.268 --> 37:36.071
Ugh. I can't eat.
I still feel sick.

37:36.105 --> 37:37.138
Did you think
this through, Henry?

37:37.173 --> 37:40.275
No.
I didn't think it through.

37:40.309 --> 37:42.143
It's just been in the
back of my mind for months

37:42.178 --> 37:45.280
and then all of a sudden
it was out of my mouth.

37:45.314 --> 37:47.248
I was gonna wait
until this time next year.

37:47.283 --> 37:49.184
You were gonna
wait until next year

37:49.218 --> 37:51.052
knowing this is how
you feel about Alice?

37:51.087 --> 37:53.254
I know, I know.

37:53.289 --> 37:56.057
I feel guilty about even having
sex with her these past few months.

37:56.092 --> 37:59.060
But it's not that I don't
love her. It's just that...

37:59.895 --> 38:02.197
I don't think
I love her enough

38:02.231 --> 38:04.132
to think about making
any kind of commitment.

38:04.166 --> 38:06.968
Well, you two were friends
before you ever got together,

38:07.002 --> 38:10.972
so I'm sure
you'll be friends again.

38:11.006 --> 38:13.975
My mom said,
"Friends to lovers forever.

38:14.009 --> 38:16.111
"Lovers to friends, never. "

38:16.145 --> 38:17.979
Never heard that one.

38:18.013 --> 38:20.048
Yeah. Me neither.

38:20.082 --> 38:21.349
But I think
she might be right.

38:21.383 --> 38:24.119
Alice isn't gonna
want to be my friend.

38:26.222 --> 38:27.255
But you two
should be friends.

38:27.289 --> 38:28.990
Of course.

38:29.024 --> 38:30.258
Not too close of a friend.

38:30.292 --> 38:32.260
Henry, I would never...

38:32.294 --> 38:35.063
Yeah, you say that now,

38:35.097 --> 38:36.364
but you're vulnerable
and she's vulnerable.

38:36.398 --> 38:39.968
Henry, no.
It's not gonna happen.

38:40.002 --> 38:42.137
Don't let it happen, please.

38:42.171 --> 38:44.205
You're... You're not
thinking right.

38:47.109 --> 38:48.276
Henry, you're
my best friend.

38:49.245 --> 38:51.079
So is Alice.

38:51.113 --> 38:54.249
I wish you'd talked to
me before this happened.

38:54.283 --> 38:56.017
Maybe I could have
done something.

38:56.051 --> 38:58.219
I don't want
you to do anything.

38:58.254 --> 39:01.289
I hate that this is happening,
but it had to happen.

39:01.323 --> 39:03.224
I can't just keep
screwing up my SATs.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.197
Oh, hi.
Hi.

39:09.231 --> 39:10.331
I didn't realize
you'd be here.

39:10.366 --> 39:13.001
I can go do something else.
Oh, no, that's okay.

39:15.137 --> 39:17.205
I think I might be
here for a few days.

39:17.239 --> 39:19.274
I have this
really huge project

39:19.308 --> 39:23.077
and I can't drive back and
forth or I'll never get it done.

39:24.113 --> 39:25.213
But I think
once it's done,

39:25.247 --> 39:27.315
I might be taking
a little vacation.

39:27.349 --> 39:29.350
Good for you.

39:29.385 --> 39:32.320
So where's our old man?

39:32.354 --> 39:34.189
Oh, he's taking Robie
and Moose for a walk.

39:36.258 --> 39:38.026
I don't how you did it.

39:38.060 --> 39:42.163
I mean, he's a little immature,
for lack of a better word.

39:42.198 --> 39:46.067
Yeah.
Charming, but immature.

39:46.101 --> 39:48.169
You're right. I don't think
there really is a better word.

39:50.306 --> 39:53.007
But you must
love him, right?

39:53.042 --> 39:56.144
I mean, you had three children with
him, so you must really love him.

39:56.178 --> 39:58.146
I guess.

39:58.180 --> 40:00.315
But not enough to be
with him every day.

40:00.349 --> 40:03.184
It might be love,
but it's a really low flame.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.254
Got it.

40:06.288 --> 40:08.990
And you?
Don't you have a girlfriend?

40:09.024 --> 40:11.960
Someone who works with Ruben
or something? Amy told me.

40:11.994 --> 40:13.995
Yeah. Didn't work out.

40:14.997 --> 40:16.297
Turns out I'm immature.

40:16.332 --> 40:19.200
Well, then, you and George
should make good roommates.

40:22.171 --> 40:23.638
You sure you don't mind
if I stay here?

40:23.672 --> 40:27.976
Oh, I don't mind. I don't know how
Ashley will feel when she gets home.

40:28.010 --> 40:29.944
Do you have any idea
when that will be?

40:29.979 --> 40:31.980
I talk to her
on the phone every night.

40:32.014 --> 40:32.981
I think she might be
getting a little bored,

40:33.015 --> 40:37.886
but I also don't think
she'll ever be back here.

40:37.920 --> 40:40.188
Ashley's wanted to be someplace
else since she was 13 years old.

40:40.222 --> 40:42.957
So maybe she'll get
her own apartment,

40:42.992 --> 40:46.027
or, best case scenario,
she'll wanna go to college.

40:46.061 --> 40:48.162
She's really a smart girl.

40:48.197 --> 40:49.197
She's got a smart mother.

41:05.147 --> 41:06.981
Hey, thanks for
sticking around.

41:07.016 --> 41:08.950
Couldn't have got that
delivery put away without you.

41:08.984 --> 41:10.184
No problem.
Just doing my job.

41:10.219 --> 41:13.087
Yeah. Where is
Prince Boykewich today?

41:13.122 --> 41:14.222
I don't know.
You don't know?

41:14.256 --> 41:16.157
Said he had
personal business.

41:22.031 --> 41:23.164
Hey, Ricky.
Hey, Bunny.

41:24.967 --> 41:28.002
Hey, little man.

41:28.304 --> 41:29.237
Daddy.

41:33.208 --> 41:35.209
He had a really
good day today.

41:35.244 --> 41:37.011
He was outside
running around all day,

41:37.046 --> 41:38.046
so he's gonna sleep
really good tonight.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.647
Oh, great.

41:39.682 --> 41:43.117
I stopped by and picked up your favorite
movie you've always wanted me to see.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.186
<i>Seven Samurai?
Yes.</i>

41:45.220 --> 41:48.122
Oh, good one. Enjoy that.

41:48.157 --> 41:50.258
And I stopped by the new Chinese
restaurant on the corner, and guess what?

41:50.292 --> 41:53.027
What?

41:53.062 --> 41:56.064
They have those
scallion pancakes.

41:56.098 --> 41:59.934
Yeah. The ones you liked from
the Chinese place in New York.

41:59.969 --> 42:02.070
Thought that Chinese food would
go really good with the movie,

42:02.104 --> 42:04.005
so I ordered dinner.
And I'm buying.

42:04.039 --> 42:07.041
Wow. Thanks.

42:07.076 --> 42:10.144
But you know, samurai
are Japanese, not Chinese,

42:10.179 --> 42:11.245
not that it matters.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.982
Oh.

42:14.016 --> 42:16.217
There aren't any
sushi places around.

42:16.251 --> 42:17.251
I'd rather have
Chinese anyway.

42:19.121 --> 42:21.222
Okay.

42:21.256 --> 42:24.192
Well, then, I guess
I'll see you upstairs.

42:24.226 --> 42:27.962
What if we all put on our pajamas
right away, wouldn't that be fun?

42:27.997 --> 42:29.364
I don't have pajamas.
I know.

42:39.208 --> 42:41.209
So, you got her just where
you want her, don't you?

42:41.243 --> 42:43.111
What?
What's going on?

42:43.145 --> 42:46.981
Nothing.
Life is good.

42:47.016 --> 42:49.050
I know you.
You're up to something.

42:49.084 --> 42:50.284
No, she's up
to something.

42:50.319 --> 42:52.286
She's trying to get
a proposal out of me.

42:52.321 --> 42:55.256
And? And I intend to enjoy that.

42:55.290 --> 42:57.959
Yeah, well,
don't take that too far.

42:57.993 --> 43:00.128
I won't.
I really love Amy.

43:00.162 --> 43:02.130
Are you gonna
propose to her?

43:02.164 --> 43:04.232
I'd tell you, but I know you don't like
to discuss personal business at work.

43:06.168 --> 43:08.070
Night, Bunny.
