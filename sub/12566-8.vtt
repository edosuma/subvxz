21:53.597 --> 21:55.245
Oh, bless you.

21:55.742 --> 21:56.896
Did you get any sleep?

21:56.896 --> 21:59.732
Not much, but it seems like
you had a rough night too.

21:59.732 --> 22:00.848
How did you know?

22:00.848 --> 22:02.411
Well, you've never blessed me before,

22:02.411 --> 22:06.472
and didn't you have a date with
your marine biologist friend?

22:06.472 --> 22:09.020
Right. No, she canceled.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.556
Had to catch a flight to
Belize to track whale sharks.

22:11.556 --> 22:13.737
If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that.

22:13.737 --> 22:15.349
Welcome to my love life.

22:15.349 --> 22:16.683
Wait, why are we talking about my night?

22:16.683 --> 22:18.219
You had quite the evening.

22:18.219 --> 22:19.935
Roadside nasal intubation.

22:19.935 --> 22:21.127
You're the talk of the hospital.

22:21.127 --> 22:22.197
It was pretty amazing.

22:22.197 --> 22:23.881
I wish I could have been
there to see you do it.

22:23.881 --> 22:24.879
Were you nervous?

22:24.879 --> 22:28.429
When I first saw him, yes,
but then something kicked in.

22:28.429 --> 22:30.297
I can't explain it.

22:30.297 --> 22:32.808
My hands, my mind, they
started working together

22:32.808 --> 22:34.836
like I wasn't even thinking about it.

22:34.836 --> 22:37.448
After it was over, the ambulance had left,

22:38.362 --> 22:40.625
I had this realization.

22:43.021 --> 22:45.420
When I was little, I wanted to be a doctor,

22:45.420 --> 22:47.698
and as I grew older, I got so caught up

22:47.698 --> 22:52.057
in what my parents wanted
and trying to please everyone

22:52.057 --> 22:55.878
that I forgot that, and yesterday...

22:56.367 --> 22:59.410
oh, my gosh, yesterday it
all came flooding back.

22:59.410 --> 23:01.071
[exhales]

23:01.589 --> 23:04.139
Hank, I want to apply to medical school.

23:04.703 --> 23:08.016
I know. It's crazy.

23:10.239 --> 23:12.901
I mean, it is crazy, isn't it?

23:13.667 --> 23:16.517
You will be a fantastic doctor.

23:17.119 --> 23:19.529
It would mean that I would
have to slow down at HankMed,

23:19.529 --> 23:20.767
eventually quit.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.199
Or when you finish med school,

23:22.199 --> 23:24.712
you'll join HankMed as Dr. Katdare.

23:24.712 --> 23:26.460
Dr. Katdare.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.147
I don't know if I'd get used to that.

23:32.987 --> 23:35.213
I could get used to that.

23:36.006 --> 23:38.101
[phone rings]

23:40.299 --> 23:41.725
Hello.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.584
(Elan) Thanks for staying with me all night.

23:46.618 --> 23:48.051
Anything?

23:48.978 --> 23:51.745
We've walked up and down
these hospital halls 100 times.

23:51.745 --> 23:54.130
I've had PE with less cardio.

23:54.130 --> 23:55.050
[laughs]

23:55.050 --> 23:56.673
Do you think this baby
is ever going to come?

23:56.673 --> 23:58.808
Yes, I promise she will.

23:58.808 --> 24:00.740
Before Christmas?

24:00.740 --> 24:02.508
You could always take
the doctor up on her idea

24:02.508 --> 24:03.895
of Pitocin to induce.

24:03.895 --> 24:06.174
No. No drugs.

24:06.174 --> 24:08.004
Right. No drugs.

24:09.001 --> 24:11.029
Do you think that's a mistake?

24:11.508 --> 24:14.213
I think it's your decision.

24:14.213 --> 24:16.052
You're the one doing all the work.

24:17.307 --> 24:19.211
You're gonna be a good mom.

24:23.606 --> 24:25.391
Have you heard back from yours?

24:27.143 --> 24:30.516
Well, like you said,
maybe she's still at work.

24:35.241 --> 24:38.001
Elan, are you saying no to the Pitocin

24:38.001 --> 24:39.632
because you're hoping your mom will get here

24:39.632 --> 24:41.347
before you give birth?

24:43.001 --> 24:44.926
[sighs]

24:46.242 --> 24:48.159
I want her here.

24:48.159 --> 24:50.249
I've already disappointed her enough.

24:50.249 --> 24:52.093
I don't want to do it anymore.

24:54.007 --> 24:56.222
I've ruined her plans for me.

24:57.395 --> 24:59.942
I just want to get my life back on track.

25:02.439 --> 25:04.053
I miss her.

25:06.266 --> 25:08.102
I need her.

25:09.921 --> 25:11.853
Is that why you're giving up your baby?

25:12.500 --> 25:15.253
Because you think it'll help
your mom to forgive you?

25:23.601 --> 25:25.554
It may not be my place to say this,

25:25.554 --> 25:29.507
but I'm not sure that should be
first and foremost in your mind

25:29.507 --> 25:31.691
when making a decision like this.

25:32.649 --> 25:36.275
Listen, my mom and I had lots of arguments

25:36.275 --> 25:38.972
when I was a teenager,
but we always got past them.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.546
You don't know my mom.

25:40.546 --> 25:45.370
I don't, and I don't know
you very well either.

25:46.531 --> 25:50.324
But I do know that you're a very capable

25:50.324 --> 25:52.199
and strong young woman,

25:53.051 --> 25:55.198
and I think you should make this decision

25:55.198 --> 25:57.552
based on what you want.

25:59.962 --> 26:01.919
Whatever you decide,

26:01.919 --> 26:05.594
please know that Evan and I will support you

no matter what.

26:17.801 --> 26:19.110
Thank God you're here.

26:19.110 --> 26:19.925
Where is he?

26:21.210 --> 26:23.071
We were taking our wedding photos,

26:23.071 --> 26:24.448
and Bruce said he was seeing double.

26:24.448 --> 26:26.509
He stepped out of the sun,
and he seemed to be better,

26:26.509 --> 26:28.703
and... and then his speech got all garbled.

26:28.703 --> 26:30.618
Bruce, can you squeeze my hand?

26:33.403 --> 26:34.891
Can you hear me?

26:34.891 --> 26:36.775
Okay, okay, good.

26:36.775 --> 26:38.244
Can you speak?

26:38.709 --> 26:41.054
I...wife...

26:41.530 --> 26:43.628
When did his vision and
speech problems start?

26:43.628 --> 26:45.134
About two hours ago.

26:45.134 --> 26:47.137
We thought it would get
better, but it didn't, and it...

26:47.137 --> 26:48.904
and when he lost feeling on
the right side of his body,

26:48.904 --> 26:51.229
that's when I called you and 911.

26:51.229 --> 26:53.077
Bruce is having an ischemic stroke.

26:53.077 --> 26:55.688
- Oh, my God.
- Bruce, you're having a stroke.

26:56.307 --> 26:57.980
It's a blood clot in your brain,

26:57.980 --> 26:59.680
but I'm gonna do
everything I can to help you.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.271
I promise.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.050
- I'm right here.
- [mumbles]

27:03.050 --> 27:04.535
Baby, it's okay.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.073
- You're gonna be just fine.
- That's it.

27:06.073 --> 27:07.162
You just keep talking to him.

27:07.162 --> 27:08.493
I got you.

27:08.493 --> 27:09.687
I'm right here.

27:10.778 --> 27:14.167
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here, okay?

27:14.167 --> 27:16.082
You're gonna get all better.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.917
I'm right here.

27:20.385 --> 27:22.014
It's okay.

27:24.364 --> 27:27.146
Nikki, the stroke's
affected his dominant brain,

27:27.146 --> 27:30.005
where our personality,
memory, and cognition reside.

27:31.428 --> 27:33.665
I can inject thrombolytics
to break up the clot

27:33.665 --> 27:34.756
and limit the damage.

27:34.756 --> 27:35.962
Every second counts.

27:35.962 --> 27:38.926
There are risks, but the risk
of not doing it is far greater.

27:40.607 --> 27:43.514
- Okay, do it.
- Okay.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.276
It's gonna be okay, Bruce.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.439
You're gonna be okay.

27:59.522 --> 28:02.423
(Hank) The CT angiography confirmed
that the enzyme I injected

28:02.463 --> 28:05.021
dissolved the clot, but he'll
still need a carotid stent

28:05.021 --> 28:06.612
to increase flow to his brain,

28:06.612 --> 28:08.791
so we're not out of the woods yet.

28:08.791 --> 28:11.154
Well, the neurologist
said you saved his life.

28:11.445 --> 28:12.562
Thank you.

28:12.562 --> 28:13.606
I'm glad I could help.

28:13.606 --> 28:15.428
Bruce seems like a real gentleman.

28:15.825 --> 28:17.251
He is.

28:18.222 --> 28:20.622
What do you think this means
for him in the long term?

28:20.969 --> 28:22.968
The neurologist will fill you in.

28:23.273 --> 28:25.079
I'm asking you.

28:25.113 --> 28:27.767
Well, um, in the best-case scenario,

28:27.767 --> 28:29.371
he could make a full recovery,

28:29.410 --> 28:31.042
but he'll still need at least 6 to 12 months

28:31.042 --> 28:32.372
of physical therapy.

28:32.372 --> 28:34.455
And if it's not the best case?

28:35.713 --> 28:38.318
No one knows how much
function he'll recover.

28:40.835 --> 28:42.567
I'm sorry, Nikki,

28:42.567 --> 28:45.164

postpone your wedding.

and caterers and a photographer,

29:15.083 --> 29:16.897

How could my memory have been so off?

31:04.688 --> 31:06.514
All these years, I remembered her dumping me

31:06.514 --> 31:10.031
when I was the one who ended it,
and since Nikki and I broke up,

31:10.031 --> 31:11.506
I've either dated the wrong women

31:11.506 --> 31:13.485
or screwed up the right ones.

31:13.716 --> 31:15.323
Maybe the reason I can't
find the right person

31:15.323 --> 31:16.602
is because of me.

31:16.602 --> 31:19.060
And maybe you're being too hard on yourself.

31:19.310 --> 31:21.699
Like you said, it's hard to
get perspective on your life

expect to see you here.

been carried away already.
