THIS IS ONE OF THEIR STORIES.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
JUST FINISHED UP WITH THE
CLERK.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
HE'S SHOOK UP BUT OKAY.

STARTED DANCING LIKE

GUN AND ROBBED THE PLACE.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
TILL THE WAR IS WON

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
PERP WAS A BLACK MALE, AROUND
19, REALLY SEXY --

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
SEXY?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
EXACTLY HOW SEXY?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
DAMN, THAT IS SEXY.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
THERE'S ONLY ONE 19-YEAR-OLD
BLACK MALE THAT MATCHES THAT

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
SEXY PROFILE.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
AFFLUENT, QUIET, TREE-LINED SUBURB.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
UM, ONLY THE HOTTEST
UP-AND-COMING R&B STAR!

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
HERE IS WHERE ROBERT JEBEDIAH FREEMAN, WAR

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIS SONGS --
"TITTY TELETHON"?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
HERO AND CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND, DECIDED TO SPEND HIS FINAL

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
"PLEASURE ME ORALLY"?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
"DON'T TOUCH MY ANUS, GIRL"?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
DAYS.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
HOW WOULD I HAVE HEARD THIS?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
BUT THINGS DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT AS PLANNED.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD,
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
ALL DAY LONG ON THE RADIO,
THAT'S ALL I HEAR, EVEN ON THE

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Granddad: BOYS!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Huey: WE'RE RIGHT HERE,
GRANDDAD.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
WHITE STATIONS.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Granddad: IMPORTANT FAMILY
ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE ARE LEAVING WOODCREST
FOREVER.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE
DISASTER SINCE WE MOVED HERE.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
EH, IT'S NOT MY THING, BUT
IT'S WHAT PASSES FOR R&B NOW,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
ALL RIGHT?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Riley: TRUE THAT. TRUE THAT.

00:59.000 --> 00:59.000
WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Huey: NOW, THAT'S TRUE,
GRANDDAD.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I GOT TEENAGE DAUGHTERS.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Granddad: WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE SAFE, BORING LIVES.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
THEY'RE INTO BLACK GUYS, SO THIS
IS WHAT I GOT TO HEAR.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD
DAYS WHEN BLACK SINGERS WOULD

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I WAS SUPPOSED TO FIND SOME HOT,
FINANCIALLY DESPERATE OR

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
DRESS IN HIGH-HEEL BOOTS OR BURN
HOOKERS WITH CRACK PIPES?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED MAMA AND
SETTLE DOWN.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
BUT NOTHING WORKED OUT AS
PLANNED.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
YOU'RE SHOWING YOUR AGE, MY
FRIEND.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
FLIZZY'S IN TOWN, DOING A SHOW
AT WOODCREST POST PAVILION

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
IT'S JUST BEEN ONE RIDICULOUS,
STUPID, BIZARRE EPISODE AFTER

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
ANOTHER, AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT
FOR MOVIN' US HERE.

01:13.000 --> 01:13.000
TONIGHT.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I WAS HOPING TO GO.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
NOW I HAVE AN EXCUSE.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I'M TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Riley: WELL, I SAY IT'S ABOUT
TIME!

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I BEEN SAYIN' THIS PLACE SUCKS
SINCE WE SHOWED UP.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Granddad: WELL, I HAVE
LEARNED MY LESSON.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
BUILDER REFUSED

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
INSPIRATION THAT MADE LADY SING

01:24.000 --> 01:24.000
WE'RE LEAVING.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Huey: WAIT A MINUTE,
GRANDDAD.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Granddad: WHATEVER DO YOU
MEAN, GRANDSON?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Huey: I MEAN, YOU NEVER TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY OR LEARN A

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
LESSON...EVER.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Granddad: UH...

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Huey: WE'RE BROKE, AREN'T WE,
GRANDDAD?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Granddad: EHHH...

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Riley: GRANDDAD BROKE? PSH.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
EVERYBODY KNOW GRANDDAD GOT LOTS
OF PAPER.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
TELL HIM, GRANDDAD.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I'M SORRY, BOYS.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Riley: AW, NO, GRANDDAD.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
YOU DIDN'T!

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, CALM DOWN.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
GRANDDAD, WHAT WE GOT TO EAT?!

01:57.000 --> 01:57.000
HOW BAD IS IT?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
WE HAVE NO MONEY?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Granddad: RENT!

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Granddad: WORSE.

01:59.000 --> 01:59.000
Riley: I'M HUNGRY!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Granddad: THEN HAVE SLEEP FOR
DINNER!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Riley: WORSE?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
WHAT'S WORSE THAN NO MONEY?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
YOU CAN EAT TOMORROW.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
YOU'RE GETTING FAT ANYWAY!

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Huey: WE'RE IN DEBT.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
THE SECURITY-CAMERA FOOTAGE
YOU'RE WATCHING IS ALLEGEDLY OF

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Granddad: MM-HMM.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Huey: HOW MUCH?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Granddad: A COUPLE...

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
A COUPLE...

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
R&B SUPERSTAR PRETTY BOY FLIZZY
HOLDING UP A LIQUOR STORE IN

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Granddad: MILLION!

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
WOODCREST.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I REFINANCED WITH THAT DAMN

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO
CLEARLY SEE THE SUSPECT'S FACE,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE!

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
AUTHORITIES SAY HIS SEXINESS IS
AN EXACT MATCH.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
THE DANCING LADY IN THAT POP-UP
AD LOOKED SO FRIENDLY!

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
THIS ISN'T FLIZZY'S FIRST
RUN-IN WITH THE LAW.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
LAST YEAR, HE RECEIVED FOUR
MONTHS PROBATION AFTER BEATING

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
HOW COULD I KNOW IT WOULD SHOOT

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
UP TO 21%?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
HIS THEN-GIRLFRIEND CHRISTIANNA
LIVE ONSTAGE DURING THE GRAMMYS.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Riley: AW, GRANDDAD.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
ALL MY FANS FOR BEATING MY HOT

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
THANKS FOR KILLIN' OUR FUTURE.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Granddad: I'M SORRY.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I'M SO...SO...SO...

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Riley: IT'S GONNA BE REAL
EMBARRASSING BEING THE ONLY

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
R&B GIRLFRIEND.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I LET MY FANS DOWN.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
WITHOUT YOU, I WOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE AN R&B GIRLFRIEND TO BEAT.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
HOMELESS KID AT SCHOOL,
GRANDDAD.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Both: WHOA.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
A YEAR BEFORE THAT, FLIZZY
RECEIVED A TWO-YEAR SUSPENDED

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
SENTENCE FOR SMUGGLING AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS FROM NICARAGUAN REBELS.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Granddad: DAMN, DAMN, DAMN.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
ALL MY FANS FOR SMUGGLING

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
PAYMENT

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FROM
SOUTH AMERICAN DEATH SQUADS.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I MAKE NO EXCUSES, OTHER THAN IT
WAS A REALLY GOOD DEAL AND THEY

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
UNDER

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
WERE THROWING IN A LOT OF FREE
AMMUNITION.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
SIX MONTHS AGO, FLIZZY WAS
ARRESTED FOR FIGHTING IN THE

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
WATER

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
V.I.P. SECTION OF A NIGHTCLUB

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
ALL MY FANS, FOR FIGHTING IN THE

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
V.I.P. SECTION WITH NICKI MINAJ.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
IN MY DEFENSE, I THOUGHT SHE WAS
A ROBOT SENT FROM THE FUTURE TO

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
KILL ME.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
WOODCREST TEA PARTY CHAIRMAN
UNCLE RUCKUS STAGED A SMALL

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
PROTEST AT THE VENUE TODAY.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Ruckus: WHO KEEPS GIVING
THESE HIGH-YELLOW FELONS RECORD

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
CONTRACTS?!

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
OH, OH, IT'S JUST A RECORD YOU
SAY!

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
WELL, WHITE FOLKS, YOU WON'T BE
SAYING THAT WHEN THE NIGGA THAT

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
SINGS ON THAT RECORD COMES TO
TOWN AND IMPREGNATES ALL THE

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
WHITE WOMEN OF CHILD-REARING
AGE!

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE
PLANS TO DO!

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
JUST THINK OF ALL THE GOVERNMENT
MONEY AND FOOD STAMPS THAT THEM

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Granddad: GOD DAMN IT, BOY!

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
YOU REALLY NEED ALL THAT DAMN
ORANGE JUICE?!

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
LITTLE MIXED-RACE QUADROON NIGGA
CHILDREN WILL BE CONSUMING!

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
AND THEY CONSUME A WHOLE LOT
MORE THAN REGULAR CHILDREN

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
FROM NOW ON, THAT'S ALL THE
ORANGE JUICE YOU GET.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
'CAUSE THEY EATIN' FOR TWO
RACES!

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Riley: COME ON, GRANDDAD.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I'MA STILL BE THIRSTY AFTER
THAT.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
OTHERS FELT DIFFERENTLY.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE
SAYS.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Granddad: THEN DRINK WATER.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
LISTEN UP.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
FLIZZY CAN WHUP MY ASS ANYTIME!

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
MR. FREEMAN, LOOK OVER HERE!

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Tom: IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND...

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Ruckus: MORNIN', NIGGA.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Granddad: TURN THAT DOWN.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
NOW LISTEN, LISTEN. Shh!

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Huey:  IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT UNCLE RUCKUS IS RUNNIN'

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Sarah: I'M TIRED OF IT!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
IT'S BORING!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
FOR MAYOR.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
IT'S BORING ME TO DEATH!

04:04.000 --> 04:04.000
WHY?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO...

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Tom: SARAH, PLEASE CALM DOWN!

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
A NEW FACE IN THE REPUBLICAN
CAMPAIGN RACE -- FROM SEEMINGLY

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I SAID I APOLOGIZE!

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000

MR. UNCLE RUCKUS.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Sarah: THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN!

04:13.000 --> 04:13.000
Tom: DOING WHAT?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Sarah: APOLOGIZING!

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
FINANCED BY BILLIONAIRE
BANKING TYCOONS AND MR. BURNS

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Tom: YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
APOLOGIZE?

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
KNOCK-OFF ED WUNCLER AND HIS
ECONOMY-CRUSHING SON, EDDIE JR.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Sarah: NO, I DON'T!

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Tom: OKAY, I'M SORRY I'M
APOLOGIZING.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Sarah: YOU DID IT AGAIN!

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
THIS MR. RUCKUS IS NOT -- I
REPEAT, NOT -- AN

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Tom: SARAH, CALM DOWN!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I'M SORRY.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I'M SORRY!

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, BUT, RATHER, A
CAUCASIAN MAN SUFFERING FROM A

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I CAN'T STOP!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Sarah: OH, I SWEAR TO GOD,
TOM, IF YOU APOLOGIZE AGAIN, YOU

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
RARE SKIN CONDITION CALLED
REVITILIGO.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
ARE OUT OF HERE!

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Tom: I'M --
MM.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
LIBERALS ARE, OF COURSE,
RIDICULING THIS MAN'S DISEASE,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
OKAY.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
THEN JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
WHICH, I CAN ASSURE YOU, IS
COMPLETELY REAL -- UNLIKE RAPE.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Sarah: THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
TOM!

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT
TO DO!

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT I WANT YOU
TO DO BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Huey:  YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
UNCLE RUCKUS RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND BASICALLY ALMOST WON.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
DO IT!

04:41.000 --> 04:41.000
Tom: WHAT?!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
BUT WHY NOT JUST TELL ME?!

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
HIS STANDOUT MOMENT WAS DURING

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Sarah: BECAUSE!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
NO WOMAN WAKES UP AND SAYS,
"GEE, I HOPE MY MAN DOES

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEBATE.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
EVERYTHING I TELL HIM TO TODAY."

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
UNCLE RUCKUS, GIVE US YOUR
STRONGEST CRITIQUE OF

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
YOU'RE THE MAN, TOM!

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000

Huey: IT'S TOILET PAPER AND

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Ruckus: THIS IS THE THANKS I

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000

MANAGEMENT TO ME.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
OKAY, THEN, SO WHAT'S THE BIG
SECRET THAT YOU CAN'T

PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MATTER OF FACT, WHY AM I EVEN

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MR. WUNCLER THE SECOND.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Tom: YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL CASE.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
CALL ME EDDIE.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Tom: DID YOU ROB THE LIQUOR
STORE, FLIZZY?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
THE COUCH IS...UH, BEAUTIFUL,
WITH THE...THE CARPET.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I CAN'T SAY THAT...I DID IT,
BUT, HONESTLY, REALLY CAN'T SAY

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
OH, I-I'M SORRY.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
THIS IS MY ASSISTANT,
VANDERBILT.

07:22.000 --> 07:22.000
F'SHO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Tom: AND WHY CAN'T YOU SAY
"F'SHO"?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
YOU DO HAVE A LOVELY HOME.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
UP!

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I  used to have a lovely home.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Tom: AND HOW ABOUT THESE --
HOW ABOUT YOUR ENTOURAGE?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE...

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
HEY, MAN, WHEN WE GO OUT, WE GO
HARD.

07:31.000 --> 07:31.000
SO, LOOK.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
COMPLICATED IT IS BEING ME.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY WHERE I NEED
TO BE WITH THE HOUSE.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
ALL THE TIME I
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I SAID.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Tom: HOW?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
'CAUSE I GOT LIKE 18 PEOPLE
TWEETING FOR ME AT ONE TIME.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Granddad: YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
LOOK, I'M JUST HERE TO GET
YOU THE  OUT.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
UP!

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
SO, LIKE, I LOOK AT THE TAPE AND
I SAY, "IS IT ME, OR IS IT

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
SOMEONE I JUST PAID TO ROB A
LIQUOR STORE WHO LOOKS JUST LIKE

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000

I DON'T KNOW.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Tom: OKAY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
UP FRONT THAT I HAVE SERIOUS

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
OH, YOU SHOULDA

BEHAVIOR IN THE PAST, ESPECIALLY

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
ROBERT, IT'S ME.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
IT'S YOUR NEPHEW, EDDIE.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
HITTING A WOMAN.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I'D NEVER KICK YOU OUT OF HERE.

07:57.000 --> 07:57.000
B-BUT WAIT.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I KNEW YOU WAS GONNA SAY THAT.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT,
THOUGH?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
POCKET CHANGE.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Tom: NO, I DON'T --
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
DON'T NEED THAT.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Tom: NO, FLIZZY, THERE'S --
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
HEY, YOU CHECK FOR HOLLOWED-OUT
SPACES, EH?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
YOU REMEMBER THOSE
NUNS WAS TRYIN' TO HIDE

08:05.000 --> 08:05.000
THOUGH?!

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Tom: FINE! WHAT?!

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
SISTERS RIGHT THERE.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Riley: HEY, MAN, WHY YOU
STEALIN' OUR STUFF?!

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
SOON AS I GOT ARRESTED, I SAID,
"I WANT THE DUDE THAT GOT

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Granddad: Shut up.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
It's  his  stuff.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
R. KELLY OFF."

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
NO, NO, NO, THIS IS ASSET
RE-MANAGEMENT HERE.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Tom: WELL, I PROSECUTED
R. KELLY, AND I --

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
NEVER MIND.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Granddad: PLEASE, MR. EDDIE,
HELP YOURSELF.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Tom: MY ANSWER IS ALMOST
CERTAINLY NO, BUT...I'LL THINK

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
IT'S YOUR LIVING ROOM.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
ABOUT IT.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
IT'S YOUR, UH....

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
IF I DO TAKE THE CASE, MY
RETAINER IS --

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
DEAD GRANDMOTHER'S ASHES!

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
MY RETAINER IS...

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
OKAY, SO, LOOK.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
ENTERTAIN THAT.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I ADDED UP YOUR TITLE INSURANCE
AND YOUR HOMEOWNER'S POLICY, AND

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
THE NEW RATE ON YOUR SUB-PRIME,
NON-PRIME, UNDER-PRIME MORTGAGE

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Tom: PLEASE STOP THROWING
MONEY AT ME.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
IS $52,000.47.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
THINGS A BITCH WILL NEVER
SAY.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
HEY, THAT'S A SONG!

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET THAT TO ME
IN, LET'S SAY, UM, A MONTH?

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
A'IGHT, PIMPIN', I'M-A SEE
YOU TOMORROW.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Granddad: A MONTH?!

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I CAN'T COME UP WITH THAT KIND
OF MONEY IN A MONTH!

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
WELL, NOT IF YOU KEEP PUTTIN'
ALL THAT NEGATIVE ENERGY INTO

08:43.000 --> 08:43.000
THE UNIVERSE.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
YOU GOT TO THINK POSITIVE.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Tom: THAT SINGER
PRETTY BOY FLIZZY CAME IN TODAY.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000

IN A MONTH."

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Sarah: PRETTY BOY FLIZZY?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

08:48.000 --> 08:48.000
SAY IT! WATCH.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
HE'S HIRING YOU TO DEFEND HIM
FOR THE LIQUOR-STORE THING?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Granddad: I  WILL  GET EDDIE'S
MONEY IN A MONTH.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
TOM, THAT'S HUGE!

08:52.000 --> 08:52.000
AGREED!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Granddad: WAIT! NO!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Tom: DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.000
GOT TO RUN.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
IT'S ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I'M NOT TAKING THE CASE.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Sarah: WHY NOT?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Tom: I DON'T WANT TO DEFEND A
WOMAN-BEATER, FOR ONE.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
CHOP CHOP, VANDERBILT!

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Sarah: HE MADE A LITTLE TINY
MISTAKE.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Tom: I GUESS HITTING A WOMAN
IS OKAY IF YOU HAVE ABS,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Nothing is going to be okay.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Listen to me.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Fake your deaths.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.000
IS THAT IT?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Sarah: HE'S A TALENTED
ARTIST.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Do you hear me?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Fake...your...deaths.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Tom: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, OKAY.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
SLOW DOWN.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
"FLUID SWAP"?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
"RUB AGAINST MY ERECTION"?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH"?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I LOVE
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
OH, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET
HIM TO SING AT JAZMINE'S

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
BIRTHDAY?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Tom: NO! DO YOU LET HER
LISTEN TO THAT?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Sarah: OUR PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
ROUGH ON HER.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
IT WOULD BE NICE TO, YOU KNOW...

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
HUH?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
WHAT?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
FREEMAN.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Tom: DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Sarah: WHAT?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
MY NIGGER.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Tom: THIS ISN'T ABOUT
JAZMINE.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
CAN I SAY THAT? YES, I CAN.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Granddad: MR. WUNCLER.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
YOU  WANT TO MEET
PRETTY BOY FLIZZY.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
UH...

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
NO,  JAZMINE
WANTS TO MEET PRETTY BOY FLIZZY.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU ON A
SUNDAY MORNING AT 7:00 A.M.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I WAS JUST...WONDERING IF YOU,
UM, HAD THAT MONEY.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Tom: NO, YOU WANT ME TO
DEFEND PRETTY BOY FLIZZY BECAUSE

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
WELL,
UM...MON-- MONEY...W-W-WE, UH...

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
YOU WANT TO MEET HIM AND  DO  HIM!

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Sarah: WHAT?!

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
YOU GOT MY MONEY, RIGHT?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Tom: YEAH! YEAH! YOU DO!

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLE-E-EASE TELL
ME YOU HAVE MY MONEY, ROBERT,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
YOU WANT TO GO UNH ON HIM!

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
PLE-EASE!

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Granddad: WELL...YOU SEE --
EDDIE?!

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
YOU WANT TO UNH ON HIM ALL
NIGHT!

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Sarah: I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW
INSECURE YOU ARE!

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
PLEASE!

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Granddad: YES, WELL, I'M
WORKIN' ON IT, BUT I DON'T HAVE

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

09:54.000 --> 09:54.000
THE MONEY RIGHT NOW.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
YOU DON'T HAVE MY MONEY.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Tom: HE'S LIKE YOUR PERFECT
MAN!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Granddad: WELL, I DON'T HAVE ALL  OF IT.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
HOW MUCH YOU HAVE?

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
HE WON'T EVEN SAY SORRY WHEN HE
POUNDS YOUR FACE IN!

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Granddad: RILEY!

09:59.000 --> 10:08.000
BRING THE SUITCASE WITH THE
MONEY!

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Granddad: WAIT.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
WAIT.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
HE'S NOT COMING THIS WAY.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
HE'S GETTING IN HIS CAR.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
WITH ME,
RIGHT?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
SERIOUSLY, WHERE'S MY MONEY?!

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
YOU DON'T HAVE MY MONEY?

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Tom: YOU'RE A SELFISH
BASTARD, ROBERT FREEMAN!

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
GOD...DAMN!

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
A'IGHT. EDDIE. THINK.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
WAIT! I GOT IT!

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Granddad: WHAT?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
THE HOUSE.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Tom: I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA WORK OUT, FLIZZY.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
WE CAN MAKE MONEY OFF THE
HOUSE -- TOGETHER.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.000
WHY NOT?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
WE RENT OUT EACH OF THE ROOMS AS
A SEPARATE UNIT -- TWO BEDROOMS,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Tom: WELL, IT'S NOT YOU.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
IT'S ME.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'M JUST DEALING WITH SOME
PERSONAL PROBLEMS.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
GUEST ROOM, LIVING ROOM AND
KITCHEN, ATTIC -- HOW MUCH IS

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
UP, MY
DUDE!

10:31.000 --> 10:31.000
COME ON, TOM!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
THAT, VANDERBILT?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE BOTH LETTING
THE HATERS GET US DOWN.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
MORE THAN YOU'RE GETTING NOW,
SIR.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
WE GOT TO SHAKE THE HATERS.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Granddad: WHAT DO WE THINK
ABOUT...HAVING PEOPLE MOVE IN

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
DO THIS FOR ME, TOM.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
COME ON. SHAKE THOSE HATERS.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
HERE?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I'M HATE-FREE, BUT I CAN STILL
FEEL THE HATE ON YOU.

10:38.000 --> 10:38.000
GENIUS, RIGHT?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Huey: WHOA. WAIT.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Riley: YEAH, MAN, SLOW DOWN.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
MMM. FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I'M TELLIN' YA, IT'LL BE
GREAT.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
YOU GUYS WILL LOVE IT.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
IT'LL BE LIKE A COMMUNE.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
OKAY, SO...

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
NOW WILL YOU TAKE THE CASE?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
HUEY, YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF
PEOPLE TO TALK TO AND SHARE ALL

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Tom: NO.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
OKAY, FINE.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
YOUR POLITICAL IDEAS.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE CASE, YOU
CAN'T TAKE THE CASE.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
IT'LL BE LIKE OCCUPY, BUT RIGHT
HERE AT HOME.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ME -- SEXY,
BUFF ALPHA MALE -- AND YOU --

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
"OCCUPY MY LIVING ROOM."

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Riley: WHERE DO  WE  LIVE?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
KINDHEARTED BUT FRUMPY
EVERYMAN -- COULD SOMEHOW BE

10:55.000 --> 10:55.000
THE GARAGE!

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
IT'S DAMN NEAR LIKE A WHOLE
OTHER HOUSE.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
ABLE TO HELP EACH OTHER.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
I'M TELLIN' YOU, Y'ALL COULD
HGTV THAT SHIT UP.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Tom: AM I A FRUMPY EVERYMAN?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
MAKE THIS SHIT FLY.

11:01.000 --> 11:01.000
IS THAT IT?!

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
IS THAT WHY SHE'S LOST
INTEREST?!

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
OF COURSE.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
TOM!

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
YOU GOT NO FLASH, NO SWAG, NO
THIN VENEER OF TOUGHNESS.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
It's never too late to fake
your own death.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
OF COURSE YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU AND
IS DOING IT TO SOME RANDOM GUY.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Tom: THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID
HAPPENED.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
SO, LOOK -- YOU TAKE THE
CASE, AND I TEACH YOU HOW TO

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
DRESS AND HOW TO TALK TO BITCHES
AND SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Tom: YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
WHY NOT?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TEACH ME HOW TO
DANCE, RIGHT?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
NO.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
NO DANCING.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
BUT THERE WILL BE A SHOPPING
MONTAGE.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
TWO THINGS WOMEN HATE -- BROKE
MEN AND BORING MEN.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Granddad: HEY!

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'RE NOT BROKE.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Granddad: YES, UH, I'M THE

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
BUT YOU ARE BORING, AND WOMEN
HATE TO BE BORED, TOM.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
OWNER OF THE HOUSE.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
YOU AIN'T THE OWNER OF THE
HOUSE.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
THEY HATE TO BE BORED.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
EDDIE WUNCLER'S THE OWNER OF
THIS HOUSE

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
A WOMAN WOULD RATHER BE WITH A
GUY THAT BEATS THEM TO DEATH

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Granddad: YES, WELL, I'M
ROBERT FREEMAN, CIVIL RIGHTS --

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
THAN BORES THEM TO DEATH.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
TRUST ME, NIGGA, I KNOW.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
BUT WHY DO THEY WANT ME, TOM?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
DO YOU WANT?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Granddad: I WAS HOPING TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
IS IT MY INCREDIBLE SEXINESS?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
SURE.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
THERE'S A BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
BUT WHY AM I SO SEXY?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Granddad: YES, BUT I WOULD
PREFER TO U--

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
WHAT IS THE SECRET TO MY
SEXINESS?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
OUT MY FACE, NIGGA!

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
MY MONEY, MY JEWELS, FAME?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
ABSOLUTELY.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT?!

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
BUT, REALLY, IT'S BECAUSE I'M A
UP.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Granddad: NO, PLEASE.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I DON'T WANNA HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I GET ARRESTED, I DO DRUGS, I
ROB LIQUOR STORES -- ALLEGEDLY!

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE
BATHROOM.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
THAT'S WHAT ALL WOMEN WANT.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Tom: WHY?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE NO
SELF-RESPECT!

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Tom: WELL, MY WIFE HAS

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
SELF-RESPECT.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
REALLY? YOU SURE?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Tom: YES!

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
SHE'S AN EDUCATED, WELL-ROUNDED,
CONFIDENT WOMAN.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
THAT'S IT!

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I MAY NEED TO MEET HER.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
HE RENTED MY BATHROOM!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Tom: NO, NO, NO. NO.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
OH, THAT'S THE WHOLE HOUSE.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I KNOW WHERE THIS GOES.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
A MAN CAN'T TRULY CALL HIMSELF A
MAN ONCE A STRANGER'S ASS CHEEKS

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO MY WIFE.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
DO YOUR WIFE?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
TOM, I WOULDN'T DO YOUR WIFE.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
HAVE BEEN ON HIS PRIVATE TOILET!

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Tom: YOU HAVE A SONG CALLED
"I WILL DO YOUR WIFE!"

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Riley: THIS ALL YOUR FAULT,
GRANDDAD.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
YOU REALLY TURNED OUR LIFE INTO
"GOOD TIMES."

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I DIDN'T MEAN  YOUR  WIFE!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Granddad: OUR LIFE IS NOT
"GOOD TIMES."

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I MEANT THAT METAPHORICALLY.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
WE STILL LIVE IN A NICE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Riley: YEAH, FOR NOW.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Tom: MM, I STILL DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Huey: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET A
JOB, GRANDDAD.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
NIGGA, I SWEAR ON MY ABS --
ON MY ABS, NIGGA! -- I WILL NOT

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Granddad: WHY DO  I  HAVE TO
GET A JOB?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
WHY CAN'T Y'ALL GET JOBS?

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Huey: CHILD LABOR LAWS,
UNSAFE WORKPLACES, REALLY SMALL

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
TOUCH YOUR WIFE.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Tom: WELL, MY DAUGHTER WOULD
LOVE TO MEET YOU.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
HANDS.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
A SMALL DINNER.

12:45.000 --> 12:45.000
Granddad: THAT'S GARBAGE!

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
YOUR GENERATION IS JUST LAZY,
THAT'S ALL.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
NO ENTOURAGE!

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
NO PROBLEM.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
PLUS, WHO'S EVEN HIRING NOW?

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THESE

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
AW, COME ON.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I THOUGHT YOU GAVE UP WORK TO
RUN FOR MAYOR.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
PEOPLE SHOWED UP.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Ruckus: I DIDN'T GIVE UP
WORK.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Tom: WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
HADN'T TWEETED OUR ADDRESS TO

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I GAVE UP WORKING FOR NIGGAS,
AND OTHER COLORS, LIKE MEXICANS

12:58.000 --> 12:58.000
3 MILLION PEOPLE...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
HEY, MAN...

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Tom: YEAH, YOU WERE F'ed UP,
I KNOW.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
AND SAND PEOPLE.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
NOW YOU BETTER GRAB SOME SUDS
AND START WAXING HOODS.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
OKAY, SO, CHECK IT.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
KEY WITH CHICKS IS TO INSULT
THEM WHEN YOU COMPLIMENT THEM.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
WAX ON, WAX OFF, NIGGA!

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
NEVER BE TOO NICE.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
TRUST ME.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
GO NEG ON HER.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
KNOCK HER DOWN A PEG.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Granddad: DAMN!

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
WHAT'S THIS THING, ELECTRIC?

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Tom: HEY, SWEETIE, YOU LOOK
LOVELY TONIGHT.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Sarah: OH, THANK YOU, HONEY.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Tom: YEAH, BUT NOT AS NICE AS
YOU THINK YOU LOOK.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
COME ON, MAN!

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Sarah: ASSHOLE!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
LESS SWEAT, MORE SCRUB!

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
LOOK, LOU GOSSETT JR. IS
WASHING MY CAR.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
STOP TRYING TO HIDE INSIDE MY
TRUNK.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I DON'T KNOW  WHY  THEY FIRED
THE SAND PEOPLE.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Granddad: HEY, NEIGHBOR!

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
WE, UH, HEARD THERE'S A DINNER
PARTY GOING DOWN, AND I NEVER

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
RECEIVED THE E-VITE, SO HERE WE
ARE.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Ruckus: OH, LOOK AT THAT.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
FEEL THAT, NIGGA? FEEL THAT?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
THAT FEELIN' IS CALLED "WORK."

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Tom: YOU DIDN'T GET ONE
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T INVITED.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
THAT'S WHAT WHITE FOLKS BEEN
DOIN' THEY WHOLE LIVES.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE LEAVING
ME OUT IN THE COLD AND THEN

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Granddad: SHUT UP, RUCKUS.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
WHEN DO I GET PAID?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
WANTING TO COME TO THE FLIZZY
DINNER FOR THE FREE FOOD.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Ruckus: I DON'T KNOW, NIGGA.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
YOU FIRED.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Granddad: FIRED? WHY?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Granddad: WE DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR THE FREE FOOD.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Ruckus: IT WASN'T ME.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
THE CAR-WASH BRASS IS CUTTIN'
BACK HOURS.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
WE CAME HERE TO WARN YOU.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
TOM, YOU GOT TO GET THAT FLIZZY
AWAY FROM YOUR WIFE!

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
TOUGH LUCK, NIGGA.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
WE'LL CALL YOU WHEN WE NEED YOU.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
IT'S BAD ENOUGH SHE'S TRAPPED IN
THIS PASSIONLESS, SEXUALLY

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
UNFULFILLING MARRIAGE WITH YOU.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
HER LADYPARTS PROBABLY BURNING
WITH UNQUENCHABLE LUST, AND YOU

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Granddad: I GOT LAID OFF AT
THE CAR WASH TODAY.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
JUST GONNA DANGLE ALL THAT
SEXINESS IN FRONT OF HER?!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Riley: AW, MAN.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
WHAT'D YOU DO NOW?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Tom: HUH?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Granddad: NOTHING!

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Riley: MAN, IT'S LIKE, "HERE,
NIGGA, TAKE MY WIFE, PLEASE!"

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
IT WAS A TEMPORARY LAY-OFF.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Granddad: HUH?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Huey: YOU KNOW HE'S GOT A
SONG CALLED --

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Riley: HUH?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Tom: "I WILL DO YOUR WIFE,"
YES.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Granddad: WHAT THE...?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Huey: BUT THERE'S ALSO A
SONG CALLED, "WHITE WIFEBOOTY."

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
UNCLE RUCKUS IS BACK ON THE
SCENE, RUFFLING SMALL-TOWN

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
KNOW THAT?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Tom: REALLY?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
NO, NO, I DIDN'T.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
FEATHERS WITH BOLD IDEAS.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER, GUYS.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Ruckus: BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA
THINKS BLACK PEOPLE MADE THIS

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I-I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
FLIZZY'S GONNA HELP ME WORK
THINGS OUT WITH SARAH.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
COUNTRY GREAT.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Granddad: OH, HE GONNA WORK
SOMETHING OUT, ALL RIGHT.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Tom: HE'S HERE TO HELP.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Granddad: OH, HE GONNA HELP
HIMSELF TO THAT BOOTY!

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
HE ALMOST RIGHT.

14:26.000 --> 14:26.000
Tom: IT'S UNDER CONTROL!

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
THE WHITE HALF OF HIM RIGHT,
BECAUSE THE WHITE BUSINESSMAN,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Granddad: HE'S GONNA --
Tom: CONTROL THAT BOOTY.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
GOT IT.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
THAT WHITE ENTREPRENEUR WHO HAD
THE SENSE TO LOOK AT OUR BIG,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Granddad: I WASN'T GONNA
SAY THAT.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
HE GONNA BE UNDER THAT BOOTY!

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Riley: HA HA!

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
BLACK, AFRICAN NEGRO MAN PUT
THAT NIGGA IN CHAINS, DRAGGED

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
GOOD ONE, GRANDDAD!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Tom: YEAH, HA, YEAH, VERY
FUNNY GUYS. ENOUGH.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
HIS BLACK ASS ALL THE WAY OVER
HERE TO AMERICA TO DO SOME

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Granddad: AS LONG AS YOU
KNOW.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
NEXT TIME YOUR KIDS ARE BORN
WITH GREAT ABS AND TATTOOS,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
PRODUCTIVE WORK.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
NOW,  THAT'S  WHAT'S MADE AMERICA
GREAT!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
COME ON, KIDS. LET'S EAT.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
THANK YOU, FANS. THANK YOU.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Sarah:

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
OH, MY GOD, FLIZZY,
YOU'RE SO FUNNY AND SO POLITE.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS HOW COME WE
ARE LOSIN' TO THE CHINESE --

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ROB LIQUOR
STORES AND YOU BEAT UP WOMEN.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
BECAUSE THE CHINAMAN USES SLAVE
LABOR, AND WE DON'T.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Tom: SARAH!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
NO, IT'S COOL.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
SHE'S RIGHT.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
APPLE COMPUTERS DON'T NEED TO BE
USIN' NO CHINESE SLAVE LABOR.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I REALLY NEED TO STOP GETTING
ARRESTED.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Sarah: I'M NOT PASSING
JUDGMENT ABOUT THE CHRISTIANNA

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
THEY SHOULD BE USIN' GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED BLACKY AMERICAN

15:05.000 --> 15:05.000
THING.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I KNOW SOMETIMES BITCHES STEP
OUT OF LINE.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
SLAVE LABOR!

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
LORD KNOWS I DO!

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Tom: HONEY, THERE ARE

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
CHILDREN AT THE TABLE.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Sarah: NOW, I WANT TO BE
CLEAR, KIDS -- HITTING A WOMAN

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Granddad: THAT'S RIGHT.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
CAME IN THE MAIL TODAY.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
A GANGSTALICIOUS CARD.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
IS WRONG...

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
IT'S OUR KEY TO FINANCIAL
INDEPENDENCE.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
UNLESS SHE HITS YOU FIRST.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Huey: YOU GOT THE
GANGSTALICIOUS CARD, GRANDDAD?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
AIN'T THAT RIGHT!

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Tom: WOW.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Granddad: THAT'S RIGHT.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Sarah: OR SHE TALKS ABOUT
YOUR MAMA!

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
THE ONE ON THE COMMERCIAL --
"GANGSTALICIOUS CARD.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Tom: SARAH, THAT IS ENOUGH!

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
GET CASH BACK.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Sarah: "SARAH, THAT'S
ENOUGH."

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
YOU AIN'T GOT TO SLING THAT
CRACK!

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Tom: SARAH, THAT'S IT!

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
WHAAAT?"
I GOT ALL OF 'EM -- THE

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF IN
FRONT OF YOUR DAUGHTER AND IN

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
KARDASHIAN CARD, LIL WAYNE
CARD -- YOU SEE, BOYS?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
FRONT OF PRETTY BOY FLIZZY!

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Riley: IT'S LIKE WE NOT EVEN
HERE.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
THE KEY TO SMART FINANCE IS --
Huey: DID YOU READ THE FINE

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Tom: NOW, YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
PRINT?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
YOU ARE GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS AND
SLEEP IT OFF!

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Granddad: UH...

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, TOM?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
$1,500 IN FEES?!

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
HIT ME?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Tom: NO! I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU!

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
GOD DAMN IT, LIL WAYNE!

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
MWAH!

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Jazmine: DADDY!

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
FROM NOW ON, NOBODY LISTEN TO
LIL WAYNE OR GANGSTALICIOUS IN

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Sarah: TOM, WAIT!

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
TOM!

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
THIS HOUSE.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Granddad: TOM, GREW A PAIR.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Riley: YOU MEAN "GARAGE."

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Granddad: WHATEVER.

15:47.000 --> 15:59.000
Riley:

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
YEAH, IT'S SO COZY, A-AND I LOVE
HOW YOU ARRANGED THE BEDS.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
IT'S A VERY...ECONOMICAL USE OF
SPACE.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
BITTER.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I DIG IT.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
SAY, DO YOU MIND IF WE STORE,
UH...SOMETHING HERE FOR JUST A

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
COUPLE OF DAYS?

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANYONE ELSE
TO CALL.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Granddad: SURE. ANYTHING.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
EH, NO SWEAT, MAN.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
THAT WAS ROUGH.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Tom: YEAH, IT WAS A DISASTER.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
SO MUCH FOR MAKING A MAN OUT
OF ME.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
SO, WE JUST CAME BY BECAUSE
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE'VE RENTED

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
NAW, MAN.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
TO JUST STAND UP AND WALK OUT,
THAT TOOK GUTS.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
ALL THE ROOMS IN YOUR HOUSE.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Tom: ALL I ENDED UP LEARNING
IS MY WIFE LIKES YOU BETTER.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
BAD NEWS IS, WE'RE STILL NOT
REALLY MAKIN' A DENT IN YOUR

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
DEBT.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LIKE ME
BETTER.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH JUST BORING
AS

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I'LL JUST PUT THIS IN THAT NICE,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
YOU'RE ROLLING WITH ME TONIGHT.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I'M TAKING YOU TO MAN CAMP.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
BUT I DON'T HANG WITH NO
NEGATIVE-ENERGY-SUCKING

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
COOL CORNER.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Granddad: UH...

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
SO GATHER UP SOME
POSITIVITY IN THIS BITCH RIGHT

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
SURE. Y-YEAH.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
QUICK AND LET'S ROLL OUT.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Tom: OKAY! I CAN BE POSITIVE.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'M NOT A LOSER.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
I CAN...GET STUFF...HAPPENING,
AND I GOT STUFF GOING ON!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
SO, Y'ALL HAD ANY LUCK WITH
THE MONEY?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
MAYBE...MILLION, AT LEAST?

16:38.000 --> 16:38.000
SOMETHING?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Granddad: EDDIE, I'M SORRY.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
THINGS COULD BE WORSE.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I COULD BE THAT GUY.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I'M ON A FIXED INCOME.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
THINK, EDDIE, THINK.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
IT'S A MIRROR, TOM.

16:45.000 --> 16:45.000
VANDERBILT?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
FIND ME A WAY TO GET ROBERT THAT
MONEY.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, SIR.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
THEIR CREDIT IS...PISS-POOR,
SIR.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
NO!

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
THIS MAN IS A CUSTOMER.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
HE IS A DEAR FAMILY FRIEND.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
HE IS A WAR HERO -- A
CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND!

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
WE MUST FIND A WAY TO HELP HIM!

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
WELL, THERE IS ONE WAY.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
WELCOME.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Tom: OH, WHAT THE HECK.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
IT'S MAN CAMP.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Granddad: HUH?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
AT WUNCLER BANKING, WE DO
BELIEVE IN OFFERING QUALITY

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
BANKING SERVICES TO THOSE WITH
DAMAGED CREDIT.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Granddad: A LOAN! YES!

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I'LL TAKE IT!

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
DONE!

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
CONGRATULATIONS!

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I BELIEVE IN YOU, ROBERT.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I BELIEVE IN THE FREEMAN FAMILY!

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
FREEMAN FAMILY! FREEMAN FAMILY!

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Tom: HEY, THIS IS THE
BUY-N-FLY THAT FLIZZY ROBBED.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
YOU'RE MORE STUPID THAN I
THOUGHT.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
FUNNY.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Granddad: THAT WENT WELL.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Huey: DID YOU CHECK THE
INTEREST RATE?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Granddad: 150% INTEREST?!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Riley: WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Y'ALL KNOW I DON'T DO MATH.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Tom: TYLENOL?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Granddad: IT MEANS NOW I'M
ANOTHER MILLION IN DEBT.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
IT WAS A RIP-OFF, AN EASY-CREDIT
RIP-OFF!

17:45.000 --> 17:53.000
Granddad: HUH?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I'M TELLING YOU, WE'VE

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
WATCHED THIS THING A MILLION
TIMES.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
WE KNOW THAT'S FLIZZY.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
WHAT IS  THAT?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
CASE CLOSED.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
HA HA HA! YEAH!

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Granddad:

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Granddad:

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
WELL, AT LEAST WE'RE NOT

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Huey: THOSE AREN'T THE
LYRICS, GRANDDAD.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
THERE WAS A P.A. IN THE SHOT!

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Granddad: WHAT IS IT, "DRINK
A LOT OF JEW WINE"?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
RESET!

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Huey: NO.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
MAN, I'M GETTING SWEATY.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Granddad: "BANGIN' WITH A
GIANT"?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Huey: IT'S "HANGIN' IN THE
CHOW LINE," GRANDDAD.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
PRETTY'S SWEATY.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
IS SOMEONE DEAF?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
SHINE CHECK!

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Granddad: WELL, BOYS, THIS IS

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
CAN YOU THROW ME A LINE?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
TRYING TO GET MY UNION CARD.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
FIND ANYTHING, COLUMBO?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Tom: UH, NOPE!

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
NOTHING.

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
THANKS, JACK.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
IT -- MOVING DAY.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Riley: SO, SO UNFORTUNATE

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
MRS. DuBOIS, DO YOU MIND IF

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
WE DO A QUICK SOUND CHECK?

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Sarah: OF COURSE. GO AHEAD.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
" ON

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
THIS IS OUR MALE ROLE MODEL.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000

HOLD ON!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
EXCUSE ME JUST A SEC.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
YOU, UH, CAN'T SING THAT AT
JAZMINE'S PARTY.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
ABOUT
YOUR CHEMO!

18:48.000 --> 18:48.000
WHY NOT?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Sarah: NO! I LOVE THAT SONG.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
YOU GET ME MY MONEY OR YOUR

OKAY. SEE YA.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
HOW ABOUT "CAKE"?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
SURE THING, MRS. DuBOIS.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Granddad: OW, OW, OW!

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
WHOOPS.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
SORRY, I WAS JUST CUTTIN' SOME,
UH, MEAT EARLIER.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
WHAT'S UP, TIGER?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Tom: YOU FAKED THE ROBBERY.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Tom: I WATCHED THE
SURVEILLANCE TAPE, FLIZZY -- THE

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
THIS PLACE, THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
WHOLE  TAPE.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I KNOW YOU STAGED THE ROBBERY.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
GUYS.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
ISN'T THERE ANYONE WHO CAN HELP
THIS MAN?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
YOU JUST COULDN'T LEAVE
ALONE, COULD YOU?

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Ruckus: YES, SIR, MR. KINDLY
BILLIONAIRE WHITE MAN.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Tom: WHAT ELSE WAS FAKE?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WERE THE NICARAGUAN GUNS FAKE?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
DID YOU REALLY EVEN BEAT
CHRISTIANNA?

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
UNCLE RUCKUS CAN HELP YOU WITH
THAT BROKE NIGGA.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
DON'T YOU  EVER  QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT I BEAT

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
CHRISTIANNA!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I WHUPPED THAT BITCH'S ASS!

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
LOOK, IT'S FORMER
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
BUT THE NICKI MINAJ THING WAS
STAGED.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
NEXT MAYOR OF WOODCREST,
UNCLE RUCKUS!

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
SHE AIN'T REALLY A CYBORG,
EITHER.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
SHE'S A NICE GIRL.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
You get in there and you do the
thing I'm talkin' about.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
DAMN, TOM.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST MIND YOUR
OWN BUSINESS?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Ruckus: Yeah, the only thing
they understand.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Tom: I'M YOUR ATTORNEY!

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Ruckus:

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
THIS  IS  MY BUSINESS!

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
BUT WHY?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
'CAUSE I GOT TO STAY
RELEVANT! THAT'S WHY!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
SUCKS RIGHT
NOW!

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Granddad: SLAVERY?!

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
YOU GOT TO ACT LIKE AN IDIOT
JUST TO STAY IN THEIR

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
FACES!

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
BUT IF I CAN STAY IN JUST THE
RIGHT AMOUNT OF TROUBLE, I'LL BE

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS
"SLAVERY."

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I THINK ABOUT IT AS INVESTING IN
PEOPLE.

19:50.000 --> 19:50.000
ALL RIGHT.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
MY AUDIENCE IS WOMEN, TOM --
WOMEN.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I INVEST IN YOU, YOU HELP ME.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
AND WOMEN HATE TO BE BORED.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Huey: HELP YOU DO WHAT?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Riley: YEAH, WHAT WE GOT TO
DO IN RETURN?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Tom: LOOK, FLIZZY, I'M SORRY.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
IT BETTER NOT BE NOTHIN' GAY.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
NO.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I DON'T LIVE IN YOUR WORLD.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
IT JUST MEANS YOU GET TO LIVE IN
100% OF THE HOUSE 100% OF THE

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I'M A SIMPLE GUY.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I JUST WANT TO DO MY JOB, TAKE
CARE OF MY FAMILY, AND I NEEDED

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
TIME, AND, IN EXCHANGE...

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
SOME HELP TRYING TO GET MY WIFE
BACK.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Huey: YOU OWN US.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
NO, I JUST OWN 100% OF YOUR
TIME UNTIL THE DEBT IS PAID.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
OH, YOU WANT YOUR WIFE BACK?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
THAT'S FAIR, RIGHT?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
HOW ABOUT NOT INVITING A NIGGA
THAT'S RICHER THAN YOU AND

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Huey: NO!

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
SURE, IT IS.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY I COME BY
UNANNOUNCED, IN THE MIDDLE OF

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
PRETTIER THAN YOU TO MEET YOUR
WIFE?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I MEAN, HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE,
NIGGA?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
THE NIGHT, AND I NEED YOU TO
LEND A HAND...I DON'T KNOW,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Tom: WHAT?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
WASHING MY SPACESHIP, OR, SAY,
DIGGING A SIX-FOOT HOLE IN THE

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
BUT I-I THOUGHT WE WERE --

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I'M TIRED OF YOUR PUNK-ASS!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
GROUND.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
FLIZZY, I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
YOU GUYS WILL HELP ME, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT -- PEOPLE

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
LEAVE.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
HELPING PEOPLE.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
LEAVE?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I MIGHT AS WELL MOVE IN THIS
BITCH.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
SIMPLE.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Granddad: I'LL TAKE IT!

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Granddad: YOU HEARD ME.

TAKIN' THE DEAL.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
I WANT MY HOUSE BACK.

20:33.000 --> 20:33.000
Huey: IT'S SLAVERY!

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
IT'S LITERALLY SLAVERY!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Tom: NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Granddad: OH, WE'RE TOO GOOD
TO BE SLAVES?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
OH, YOU MAD, TOM?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
YOUR ANCESTORS WERE SLAVES.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
YOU WANT TO HIT ME?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000

COME ON, HIT ME NOW!

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Granddad: WHO CARES IF HE

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
Tom: ALL RIGHT, YOU ASKED
FOR IT!

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
HOW MANY YEARS DO I HAVE LEFT,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
I'VE BEEN FREE MY WHOLE LIFE,

THIS IS A PROUD DAY -- THE DAY

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
TOM, STOP!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Ruckus: OH! I KNEW IT!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I KNEW IT!

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
CITIZEN'S ARREST!

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I'M MAKING A CITIZEN'S ARREST!

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Tom:

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
WE BRING SLAVERY BACK TO
AMERICA.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Riley: NOW SHUT UP!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
FINALLY, WORTHLESS NIGGAS LIKE

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN
SILENT!

I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
YOU WERE A MANIAC!

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THAT.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
WHITE MAN AND HIS WELL-RUN
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I JUST WANT TO THANK
UNCLE RUCKUS FOR HIS

EYES.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
COURAGE TO SIGN HIS LIFE AWAY.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
JUST A NIGGA GOING TO JAIL.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I ALMOST FORGOT -- I WON THE
BET.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Sarah: OH, HONEY, I'M SO
SORRY.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I WAS SUCH A BITCH, AND YOU
DIDN'T DESERVE ANY OF THAT.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Granddad: UH...WHAT BET?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
OH, WE MADE A BET THAT I

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
HE DIDN'T THINK I COULD DO IT.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Sarah: PLEASE COME HOME.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I WON.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
