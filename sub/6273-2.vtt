WEBVTT

00:00.066 --> 00:02.634
Dr. Masters:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:02.636 --> 00:03.202
(baby wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.838
If you keep on like this,
you will end up alone.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.873
My mother will
go back to ohio.

00:07.875 --> 00:08.841
So you'll need
to get a nanny.

00:08.843 --> 00:11.543
There was a disagreement
with, uh, management
about my sex study.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.078
And you want
to get it going again?
I do.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.715
Then I've got
a proposition that might
be right up your alley.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.151
So, you were able to
accommodate bill's study?

00:19.153 --> 00:21.153
And with bill masters
comes his study.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.822
Elise:  <i>Attention</i>
<i>all hospital staff.</i>

00:23.824 --> 00:24.923
<i>Dr. Austin langham</i>

00:24.925 --> 00:25.991
<i>Has spent the</i>
<i>last two months</i>

00:25.993 --> 00:29.261
<i>Fornicating</i>
<i>with his sister-in-law.</i>

00:29.263 --> 00:30.029
I've gotten a grant to use

00:30.031 --> 00:32.297
The same technology
from your study
with dr. Masters.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.401
I was wondering
if you could give me some
background and advice.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.870
I'd be willing to pay you.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.606
(screams)

00:41.841 --> 00:42.708
(crying)

00:42.710 --> 00:44.009
I've been trying
to reach barton.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.045
On the phone,
long distance.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.047
Well, I'm starting
a new job.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.682
Dr. Masters: My wife
and I would like a room
for the night.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.384
May I get a name?
Holden.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.153
Dr. Masters: ...In terms
of how we proceed...

00:54.155 --> 00:57.122
I'm assuming that
it's not an accident,

00:57.124 --> 00:59.191
Meeting in a hotel
in alton, illinois.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.994
Of course
we're not having
an affair, virginia.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.929
I understand.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.500
(theme music playing)

01:51.945 --> 01:54.279
(crickets chirping)

01:57.550 --> 02:00.085
Did you try
on the gloves?

02:00.286 --> 02:01.920
They're too tight.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.389
My arms can't breathe.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.358
Don't be
a martyr, rose.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.426
Your mother's right.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.394
You should
respect those gloves.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.330
I remember your mother
at her cotillion,

02:11.332 --> 02:14.633
Like a beautiful butterfly
leaving its cocoon,

02:14.635 --> 02:15.968
Everybody chasing after her.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.737
I just stood very still,
and sure enough,

02:18.739 --> 02:20.973
She landed on me.

02:29.916 --> 02:30.582
Rose!

02:30.584 --> 02:32.918
Sit down and
finish your steak.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.987
Mother, I just
want to go to bed.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.722
(fork taps)

02:47.934 --> 02:50.636
Virginia: After searching
for quite a while,

02:50.638 --> 02:53.305
I found them,
all of our study files.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.073
Buried deep
in the basement

02:55.075 --> 02:58.010
By the sulfa drugs
and jars of leeches.

02:58.012 --> 02:58.744
So I went to see scully

02:58.746 --> 03:00.913
To see if he would
allow me access
to the basement,

03:00.915 --> 03:04.183
And his secretary said
that he was at lunch.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.284
So I went back after lunch,

03:05.286 --> 03:06.985
And she said that he
was gone for the day.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.988
And then this morning,
she said that he was "out,"

03:09.990 --> 03:12.925
Period, while
she shuffled papers

03:12.927 --> 03:15.827
And refused to
look me in the eye.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.596
She gave no details?

03:17.598 --> 03:21.333
The secretaries aren't
exactly forthcoming with me

03:21.335 --> 03:23.335
About anything these days.

03:23.337 --> 03:27.806
I did try to call barton
the past few days, but, uh...

03:27.941 --> 03:31.176
I can't seem
to get anywhere.

03:34.447 --> 03:37.583
And, also,
because I wasn't sure

03:37.585 --> 03:40.419
When I would be
starting at memorial,

03:40.421 --> 03:42.487
I haven't yet told lillian.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.656
Now, she talks
a good game,

03:44.658 --> 03:47.359
But she has become more
and more reliant on me.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.996
So we need to handle this
extremely delicately.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.531
I need to give her
plenty of notice.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.532
Doug greathouse feels,

03:53.534 --> 03:57.302
Uh, he's stuck his neck out
far enough with the study.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.837
It may not be, uh, possible

03:58.839 --> 04:03.242
For you to come over
to memorial for a while.

04:03.244 --> 04:03.809
For a while?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.177
I'm trying to correct
his mistaken impression

04:05.179 --> 04:08.247
That, uh, you don't have
the proper credentials

04:08.249 --> 04:10.415
To justify you to the board
as a research hire.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.351
My name is on that study.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.753
As I've pointed out.

04:16.723 --> 04:17.456
Fine.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.025
Then I'll start
as your secretary,

04:20.027 --> 04:22.060
As a temporary arrangement.

04:22.062 --> 04:22.728
I've done it before.

04:22.730 --> 04:26.031
It seems the position already
comes with a secretary.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.934
You should be able
to hire whoever you want.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.102
Well, I told greathouse
it's my study,

04:30.104 --> 04:31.870
I'll run it as I want
with whom I want.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.973
He said I'd thank him later,
as this secretary

04:34.975 --> 04:38.176
Is, in his words,
eminently qualified,

04:38.178 --> 04:40.345
Knows the hospital,
and is a "gem."

04:40.347 --> 04:45.250
There is no more qualified
"gem" than me, bill.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.719
I know the structure,
the methodology of the study.

04:47.721 --> 04:51.056
I helped to
develop it with you,
let's not forget.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.760
And dr. Ditmer
was so impressed
with my contributions,

04:54.762 --> 04:55.560
He's hired me to advise him

04:55.562 --> 04:57.929
On using cold light fusion
for gastroenterology.

04:57.931 --> 04:58.997
You're working
with frank ditmer now?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.566
Not to mention the fact,
I'm the one that recruits
the subjects.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.968
Is this a permanent
position with ditmer?

05:02.970 --> 05:06.605
Who knows how
long it will take before
greathouse comes around.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.106
Well...

05:08.108 --> 05:09.808
I mean,
obviously, I'll, uh...

05:09.810 --> 05:12.177
I'll broach the subject
with him again.

05:12.179 --> 05:15.280
No. No. Never mind.

05:15.282 --> 05:18.517
I will handle
this setback in
my own way.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.785
It wouldn't be
the first time

05:19.787 --> 05:23.255
That I've had to work around
secretarial obstacles.

05:23.257 --> 05:25.023
We have to tread carefully.

05:25.025 --> 05:25.991
I can talk to her first.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.694
Why? Why dirty
yourself at all?

05:28.696 --> 05:31.096
I'll talk to her.
I'll take her to lunch.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.031
Secretaries come and go.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.400
I'll simply drop by tomorrow

05:35.402 --> 05:38.570
And help this one on her way.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.642
Do we have a plan,

05:44.577 --> 05:46.845
Dr. Holden?

05:49.248 --> 05:51.883
It appears we do.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.528
Good morning, mr. Masters.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.232
Dr. Masters.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.166
And you?

06:08.168 --> 06:11.036
Uh, I'm coral,
sir... Doctor.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.405
I'm here to
care for the baby.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.374
(baby wailing)

06:18.711 --> 06:20.345
I believe
that's your cue.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.613
Miss libby asked
me to wait here.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.383
Perhaps she meant
that for when the
baby wasn't crying.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.152
Yes, sir... Doctor.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.456
(baby coos)

06:31.458 --> 06:35.394
I'm... I'm looking for my,
uh, jay jacobs shirt.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.195
It's hanging
on our bedroom door.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.196
It's not hanging...

06:38.198 --> 06:39.865
I see you've met
dr. Masters, coral.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.300
It's a very exciting
day for all of us.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.468
Your first day
with us, of course,

06:43.470 --> 06:47.072
But also
dr. Masters' first day
at memorial hospital.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.240
Libby,
my shirt is not...

06:48.242 --> 06:49.875
Coral, please get
dr. Masters' shirt.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.477
It's hanging
from our bedroom door.

06:55.014 --> 06:55.781
You hired a child.

06:55.783 --> 07:00.018
She's 18 and came
highly recommended
by mrs. Walton.

07:00.020 --> 07:00.419
As what?

07:00.421 --> 07:02.087
You said to handle this,
and I have.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.355
The girl needs
her own nursemaid.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.390
I thought we agreed
we would hire someone
who could actually help.

07:05.392 --> 07:08.627
She is helping.
She's coming with me
on my errands today.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.563
And who's staying
with the baby?

07:11.697 --> 07:13.198
The baby is
coming with us.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.134
For a fun family day,
out in the world,

07:16.136 --> 07:17.569
Shopping, having lunch...

07:17.571 --> 07:20.739
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I don't mean to interrupt.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.907
You're not
interrupting at all.

07:21.909 --> 07:25.577
Dr. Masters and I were
just discussing how, uh...

07:25.579 --> 07:26.678
Well, he has his way,
and I have mine.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.381
He may know what's best
for his patients' babies,

07:29.383 --> 07:32.517
But here at home,
that is my domain.

07:32.519 --> 07:33.985
(baby fussing)

07:33.987 --> 07:36.421
There was no shirt
on the door, ma'am.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.592
All right, then.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.795
We will just go find
that shirt together.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.399
(fussing continues)

08:03.216 --> 08:05.250
(groans)

08:06.118 --> 08:07.919
Teamwork, huh?
(chuckles)

08:07.921 --> 08:09.821
That's what
we're doing here.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.023
Like the three musketeers.
(sighs)

08:12.025 --> 08:12.924
This is probably
ho-hum for you,

08:12.926 --> 08:16.461
But for me and betts,
well, it's just, um...

08:16.463 --> 08:18.063
Anyway, thank you
for what you're doing.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.798
You know,
gene jr. And betty jr.,

08:19.800 --> 08:21.333
Even though
they're just twinkles
in their mother's eye,

08:21.335 --> 08:23.768
They thank you, too.
Oh, let's not go
counting chickens now.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.705
You know,
the doc's got a whole
hen house to worry about,

08:26.707 --> 08:27.439
Not just my lousy eggs.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.040
I know. You know what?
It's me being a salesman.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.642
I get my foot in the door,
I can't stop talking.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.478
So I'll wait in the car
while you work
your voodoo, huh?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.113
Mmm. (chuckles)

08:35.115 --> 08:36.548
She thinks if
I go in the room
with the gadgets

08:36.550 --> 08:39.084
And the lights,
that it's gonna
ruin the magic.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.385
You got your crosswords?

08:40.387 --> 08:41.119
Yes, and my cup of joe.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.755
All right.
I'll see you after
the heavy lifting, huh?

08:43.757 --> 08:45.924
(siren wails in distance)

08:48.327 --> 08:51.963
What kind of "lifting"
did you tell your husband
you're doing?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.765
Hmm, fertility treatments.

08:53.767 --> 08:54.566
Oh, that specific?

08:54.568 --> 08:56.201
(scoffs)
I'm open to suggestions

08:56.203 --> 09:00.238
If you wanna, you know,
make it sound fancier.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.807
What could be more fancy than
the fact that you're sterile

09:02.809 --> 09:05.310
And yet engaging
in fertility treatments?

09:05.312 --> 09:06.611
It's not my problem.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.013
Uh, I would say it is.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.649
Last I looked,
your new job came
with all the zeroes

09:10.651 --> 09:13.685
On that check
my husband wrote.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.253
Three days, we're done.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.422
Or we're done
when I say we're done.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.557
Unless you liked your study

09:18.559 --> 09:20.258
When you were peeping
through brothel doors.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.527
I'm sure the girls
miss having you around.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.095
Comic relief and all.

09:24.097 --> 09:24.930
(sighs)

09:24.932 --> 09:26.631
(elevator bell dings)

09:31.804 --> 09:33.572
Dr. Masters.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.006
Barbara sanderson.

09:35.008 --> 09:35.874
Uh, don't worry
about this mess.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.777
I will have everything
shipshape by lunch.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.345
Mrs. Masters.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.413
Dear god.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.214
Actually, uh,
I'm mrs. Moretti.

09:43.216 --> 09:48.253
Mrs. Masters is
some other lady that
drew the short straw.

09:48.255 --> 09:48.787
Mrs. Mor...

09:48.789 --> 09:53.058
Mrs. Moretti is here
for her fertility treatments,

09:53.060 --> 09:55.694
Which she will
wait for out in the hall.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.662
Oh, she's good here.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.397
She'll wait
in my office, then.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.533
She'll wait
right here, in this chair,

10:01.535 --> 10:04.836
Until the cows come home,
if that's what she pleases.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.937
Ahh!

10:05.939 --> 10:08.974
The fastest speculum
in missouri.

10:09.041 --> 10:09.708
Great to see you, bill.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.810
I hope you're treating
him right, barbara.

10:11.812 --> 10:15.580
Because this one,
he's got a bigger following
than  <i>gunsmoke.</i>

10:15.582 --> 10:16.214
(chuckles)

10:16.216 --> 10:18.650
Of course, dr. Greathouse.
(chuckling)

10:18.652 --> 10:21.086
Turns out there's been
a slight change of plan.

10:21.088 --> 10:24.756
I was going
to show you around,
introduce you to the guys,

10:24.758 --> 10:27.892
Take you to
the private dining room,

10:27.894 --> 10:31.730
But unfortunately somebody's
bleeding out in the er.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.263
Upside?

10:32.265 --> 10:35.433
It's a good
opportunity for you
to get your feet wet.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.568
What's the case?

10:36.570 --> 10:38.470
A daughter of vid.

10:38.871 --> 10:39.971
Uh, "very important donor."

10:39.973 --> 10:42.574
And after that,
we can grab lunch.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.910
She's in shock.
What's her bp?

10:45.912 --> 10:47.445
Nurse: 90 over 60,
pulse 140.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.482
She has a temperature of 103
and a respiratory rate of 30.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.916
I need a "d"
and "c" setup.

10:51.918 --> 10:52.751
Why is she
bleeding like this?

10:52.753 --> 10:55.286
I also want
35 milliliters
of corticosteroids

10:55.288 --> 10:57.322
Run every four hours
for possible sepsis.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.524
Gloves.
Nurse: Yes, sir.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.394
Betadine.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.530
(nurse speaks indistinctly)

11:06.932 --> 11:08.833
Speculum.

11:12.471 --> 11:16.975
Doctor, please.
What is happening
to my daughter?

11:17.910 --> 11:18.677
If it's what
I think it is,

11:18.679 --> 11:20.979
I'm not even
close to touching
the top of the uterus.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.547
Set up the or
for a laparotomy.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.082
Keep an eye
on her blood pressure.

11:24.084 --> 11:24.783
Nurse: Yes, doctor.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.351
Is she going
to be all right?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.452
Do you know
when this happened?

11:27.454 --> 11:29.320
She didn't come down
for breakfast this morning.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.056
I went upstairs
and there she was,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.190
On the floor,
blood everywhere.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.592
The blood loss is due
to a perforated uterus,

11:34.594 --> 11:36.728
Most likely sustained
during the curettage.

11:36.730 --> 11:37.595
Do you know any details?

11:37.597 --> 11:40.932
How far along
was she when she had
the procedure done?

11:40.934 --> 11:41.499
Far along?

11:41.501 --> 11:46.037
So you have no idea
when your daughter
terminated this pregnancy?

11:51.944 --> 11:54.145
The physician begins
by inserting the speculum

11:54.147 --> 11:55.814
Into the patient's
vaginal canal,

11:55.816 --> 11:58.817
Which allows
access to... (sighs)

11:58.819 --> 11:59.818
What?
Why did you stop?

11:59.820 --> 12:03.521
Because I look like
I should be sitting on
edgar bergen's knee.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.756
(chuckles)
that's funny.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.525
Charlie mccarthy.
My kids love
charlie mccarthy.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.928
They call him
"the wooden boy."

12:09.930 --> 12:11.563
Lillian. Please.
Please relax.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.265
I don't know how I let
you convince me to do this.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.900
Because it's a good idea.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.003
It's for doctors.
They know it's an
instructional film.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.839
And they're not
expecting lauren bacall.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.675
Well, then,
I won't disappoint.

12:24.510 --> 12:25.643
For shine.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.411
Just a little.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.714
And what does make-up
have to do with medicine?

12:31.217 --> 12:32.183
Fine.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.420
If it's so important.
You do it.

12:36.155 --> 12:39.124
Your mother didn't
teach you about make-up?

12:39.126 --> 12:41.292
That would imply
my mother knew
she had a child.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.162
No, mother's passion
was bridge.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.363
As in cards?

12:45.365 --> 12:48.433
No, as in the structure
over the missouri.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.202
I suppose your
mother powdered you
like a little doll.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.540
Every chance she got.
Please stop moving.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.375
(sighs)

12:57.377 --> 13:00.712
And did she clap when
you ate your vegetables?

13:00.813 --> 13:04.048
My mother had big dreams.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.583
Much bigger
than vegetables.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.019
Big dreams for you?
For us both.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.621
There. See?

13:10.890 --> 13:13.124
I don't understand why
pamphlets aren't enough.

13:13.126 --> 13:13.925
And I understand

13:13.927 --> 13:16.461
That you don't want to be
in front of a camera.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.165
But if you want
to be the face of
this crusade, lillian,

13:20.167 --> 13:23.168
You need to
show that face.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.370
(sighs)

13:30.643 --> 13:34.145
If you feel silly
telling people
it was tennis,

13:34.147 --> 13:36.080
Tell them
you jumped into traffic,

13:36.082 --> 13:39.751
Risking life and limb,
to save a kid from
a speeding car.

13:39.753 --> 13:40.952
Heck, make him an orphan.

13:40.954 --> 13:41.719
Quite an imagination.

13:41.721 --> 13:45.123
That explains
the comic books
in your waiting room.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.758
You gotta know
your audience.

13:46.760 --> 13:50.295
Kids and old people.
That's who breaks bones.

13:51.897 --> 13:54.132
Thank you.
You're welcome.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.301
It's none of my
business but, uh,

13:56.303 --> 13:58.803
I am sorry to hear about
your breakup with ethan.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.505
I'm going through
the same thing.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.973
A breakup, I mean.

14:01.975 --> 14:02.507
I heard.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.409
I guess that's what happens
when your dirty laundry

14:04.411 --> 14:06.811
Is aired over
the hospital intercom.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.279
Oh.

14:09.782 --> 14:14.152
My wife moved back to her
mother's in alton, illinois.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.955
I got to drive
across the river
now to see my kids.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.891
She also hired the
best divorce attorney
in st. Louis,

14:19.893 --> 14:24.329
Some guy named sherman,
as in the tank apparently.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.431
Oh, but enough about me.

14:26.433 --> 14:30.134
If you ever
need to talk...

14:30.136 --> 14:31.636
About what?

14:31.638 --> 14:34.172
Well, I don't know.
This, that.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.107
I am versed in
a wide array of topics.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.143
How much longer
do I need to keep
this cast on?

14:39.145 --> 14:42.547
The ca... Uh,
four to six weeks.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.818
Is it true,
what your wife said?

14:46.820 --> 14:48.353
About my sister-in-law?

14:48.355 --> 14:49.888
(breathes deeply)

14:49.890 --> 14:53.091
Well, what can I say?
She's a spider.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.260
I got trapped
in her web.

14:59.498 --> 15:00.498
I'm late for
a lunch engagement,

15:00.500 --> 15:03.701
And then the psa shoot
with dr. Depaul
is this afternoon,

15:03.703 --> 15:04.535
But tomorrow...

15:04.537 --> 15:06.437
Tomorrow fits
my schedule perfectly.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.107
And to give you
adequate time to prepare,

15:09.109 --> 15:12.110
My primary area of interest
is your work with ulysses.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.945
Then I'll bring her along...

15:13.947 --> 15:14.646
Him along. (chuckles)

15:14.648 --> 15:16.814
Isn't "it"
a mechanical device?

15:16.816 --> 15:17.682
(elevator bell dings)

15:17.684 --> 15:19.851
Yes, uh,
with an electric motor

15:19.853 --> 15:22.353
Controlled with
a handheld rheostat.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.188
Sounds intriguing.

15:24.190 --> 15:24.789
I will say,

15:24.791 --> 15:27.191
My respect for the work
you and dr. Masters did

15:27.193 --> 15:30.428
Grows exponentially
the more I read of it.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.331
Thank you.
That means a lot.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.632
So tomorrow, then?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.467
Tomorrow it is.

15:37.536 --> 15:38.303
Vivian.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.438
Oh, no.
Is it broken?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.306
Tennis injury.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.242
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Does it hurt?

15:44.376 --> 15:46.644
Well, um, I'm...
I'm glad I ran into you.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.379
I've been thinking
about your dad.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.982
How is your dad?
He's been gone
the last few days.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.617
He's taken
a leave of absence.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.686
A leave of absence? Why?

15:54.688 --> 15:55.353
They've gone to venice.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.556
Mother thought daddy had
been working too hard.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.858
Why are you really
talking to me?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.894
I was worried
about your dad.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.830
And, to be honest, vivian,
now I'm even more worried.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.333
Don't say my name
like you're my friend.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.669
Or did you forget that
I was engaged to ethan?

16:14.006 --> 16:15.440
Of course I didn't forget.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.342
And you're right.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.777
I should've come to you,
talked to you.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.579
Why did you
sleep with ethan?

16:21.581 --> 16:24.749
Because you were, what,
bored? Needed attention?

16:24.751 --> 16:27.085
I had a whole
future planned,
and I was happy.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.486
And you took that
future and ruined it.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.390
You devastated ethan.
Why did you do that?
What was the point?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.458
I obviously did not

16:33.460 --> 16:35.293
Plan for things
to turn out that way.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.361
Poor gini,
can't plan ahead.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.230
Doesn't see
the consequences
of her actions.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.031
Well, I see clearly.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.233
You'll do anything
to get what you want.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.334
You're upset with me,

16:43.336 --> 16:46.170
But I suspect more
upset with ethan.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.740
I would never date
a friend's boyfriend,

16:48.742 --> 16:50.274
And to be perfectly
honest, vivian,

16:50.276 --> 16:51.309
We aren't really friends.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.544
Well, why the
friendly act, then?

16:53.546 --> 16:55.513
Because you may
get away with this now,

16:55.515 --> 16:58.716
But eventually,
people will catch on.

16:58.718 --> 17:03.955
And then all
you'll be is old
and ugly and alone.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.528
I'm saying a hysterectomy
is unnecessary.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.063
Whoever performed
this last procedure

17:12.065 --> 17:14.165
Left tissue in her uterus,
which I've removed.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.300
I've also sutured
her minor lacerations.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.403
She should be back
on her feet soon.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.904
And then what?

17:19.906 --> 17:21.339
Rose moves on
with her life.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.408
And what kind
of life is that?

17:23.410 --> 17:24.208
Whatever life rose chooses.

17:24.210 --> 17:28.713
I don't think
you understand the choices
rose has made so far!

17:28.715 --> 17:32.650
Her bedroom was
on the first floor
until she was 13.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.685
But that became...
Impossible.

17:34.687 --> 17:38.156
So we moved her up
to her brother's room
on the second floor.

17:38.158 --> 17:41.159
We did everything
but chain her to the bed.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.693
She still snuck
out every night.

17:42.695 --> 17:47.565
When she was 14,
we caught her
naked with a boy.

17:48.333 --> 17:48.733
14!

17:48.735 --> 17:53.171
Mrs. Palmateer,
did you or your husband
know about this procedure?

17:53.372 --> 17:55.673
No. Not this time.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.342
When I asked you
for her medical history...

17:58.344 --> 17:59.177
It's the second

17:59.179 --> 18:02.747
Termination
that we know of.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.683
Today, she
almost bled to death.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.319
Next time, she could die.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.921
My husband is so
sickened by this,

18:09.923 --> 18:11.789
He can't even
be near her anymore.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.792
The only option left
is sterilization.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.893
Dr. Masters: Rose is 18.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.996
She has her entire life
ahead of her.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.331
That decision is hers.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.732
That decision is ours!

18:21.734 --> 18:23.768
And I refuse
to be held hostage
another minute

18:23.770 --> 18:26.671
Because my daughter can't
control her sick impulses!

18:26.673 --> 18:28.940
Bill, if I may,
you're new here.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.508
That is
completely irrelevant.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.110
This is a medical decision.

18:32.112 --> 18:32.777
I want this done, doug.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.746
You know that
we are a loving
and generous family.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.983
My obligation is to
my patient's well-being,
not her mother's.

18:38.985 --> 18:42.353
Nobody advocates
a hysterectomy on a whim.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.621
Meaning what?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.257
Meaning that maybe in
this particular situation,

18:46.259 --> 18:49.160
The family truthfully
knows what is best.

18:49.162 --> 18:54.332
Mrs. Palmateer,
the surgery will be
performed as you requested.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.134
(sighs)

18:58.837 --> 19:03.541
Honest to god,
it is criminal what's
going on in there.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.109
I... I'm no expert,

19:05.111 --> 19:07.545
But how do
you think you're
going to get pregnant

19:07.547 --> 19:10.615
Just from
sitting in a chair?

19:11.416 --> 19:14.619
Through the miracle
of modern medicine.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.556
Oh, and look at that.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.191
Time's up.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.427
I hope it's a boy.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.408
(knocking on door)

19:37.576 --> 19:37.975
Oh!

19:37.977 --> 19:39.710
Dr. Masters doesn't want
to be disturbed.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.079
At least,
I think that he doesn't
want to be disturbed.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.249
Actually, um,
I was here to see you.

19:45.251 --> 19:45.950
I'm virginia johnson.

19:45.952 --> 19:49.654
I was dr. Masters' secretary
when he was at maternity.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.455
Oh!

19:52.057 --> 19:53.224
Barbara sanderson.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.193
Uh, barb. Oh, boy.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.661
It sure is nice
to meet somebody

19:56.663 --> 19:58.429
Who knows the ropes
with this one.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.163
(chuckles)

19:59.165 --> 20:02.033
Well, I... I brought
some files for you.

20:02.035 --> 20:02.733
Oh.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.669
No, for you. They...
They might be helpful.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.637
You are an angel.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.672
(both chuckling)

20:07.674 --> 20:12.076
Could I buy you lunch?
Any chance?

20:12.144 --> 20:13.844
I could really use
a friend here.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.214
I'm doing
so many things wrong.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.182
No.
Like this morning,

20:18.184 --> 20:19.584
When I brought
dr. Masters his coffee,

20:19.586 --> 20:22.687
He didn't say anything
good, bad, nothing.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.789
He looks at me like
he wishes I were gone.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.491
Or worse.
(imitates cutting sound)

20:27.493 --> 20:29.694
(chuckles)
no. I...

20:29.696 --> 20:31.362
Oh, I...

20:31.364 --> 20:33.297
Dr. Masters.

20:33.465 --> 20:36.434
You... We have
a surprise guest.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.302
Yes, I can see her.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.304
Mrs. Johnson.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.440
Dr. Masters.
I was in the area.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.643
So I thought I would
drop off some files.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.111
For me.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.580
Isn't that swell?

20:49.582 --> 20:52.617
May I speak
with you a moment?

20:59.925 --> 21:04.495
Barton wouldn't do this
unless something
were very wrong.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.530
Did vivian say how long
he'd be on leave?

21:06.532 --> 21:09.934
Just that he was
in venice with mrs. Scully.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.836
Something about stress.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.571
What else did she say?

21:13.573 --> 21:14.905
Well, vivian was...

21:14.907 --> 21:16.707
She was anxious
to be on her way.

21:16.709 --> 21:21.078
But if hear anything else,
I will let you know.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.549
Virginia,
what about you and...

21:25.551 --> 21:27.952
Uh, barbara?
Uh, aren't you
going to lunch?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.420
Aren't you gonna
help her on her way?

21:29.422 --> 21:34.492
(sighs) I'm afraid I've
lost my appetite for that.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.340
You're 20 minutes late.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.510
I... I got held up.
I'm sorry.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.411
Well,

21:53.413 --> 21:55.513
As long as you're sorry.

21:55.947 --> 21:58.449
Can we get this show
on the road now?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.618
Like we rehearsed.

22:09.394 --> 22:10.961
Take one.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.600
And action.

22:17.436 --> 22:21.172
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>I am dr. Lillian...</i>

22:22.607 --> 22:23.074
Uh, cut.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.842
It just feels silly,
saying my name.

22:24.844 --> 22:29.413
You... You should definitely
say your name, lillian.
It's your program.

22:29.415 --> 22:32.116
I'm not going
to say my name.

22:32.284 --> 22:35.019
Okay. No name.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.520
Let's, uh, go again.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.289
Take two.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.359
Action.

22:41.361 --> 22:41.859
<i>Hello.</i>

22:41.861 --> 22:43.828
<i>You are watching</i>
<i>an instructional film</i>

22:43.830 --> 22:44.695
<i>To teach you</i>
<i>the simple steps</i>

22:44.697 --> 22:48.566
<i>To perform a very submerged</i>
<i>pap smear procedure.</i>

22:48.568 --> 22:51.769
The equipment required
for the part is following.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.838
<i>Laboratory ring form.</i>

22:53.840 --> 22:54.839
<i>Patient gowns.</i>

22:54.841 --> 22:57.341
<i>Shapes for</i>
<i>patient modernity.</i>

22:57.343 --> 22:59.076
A vaginal spectrum.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.644
<i>Schamen containers.</i>

23:00.646 --> 23:02.279
<i>A cytology brush.</i>

23:02.281 --> 23:03.347
<i>Gauze swans.</i>

23:03.349 --> 23:04.415
Did she just say...

23:04.417 --> 23:06.851
Something about swans.

23:06.985 --> 23:07.551
The statician

23:07.553 --> 23:10.321
<i>Should begins with putting</i>
<i>into the specutum,</i>

23:10.323 --> 23:14.925
<i>A patient, a cervix,</i>
<i>and henny swabs...</i>

23:14.927 --> 23:16.627
Virginia: Stop.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.362
Uh, cut!

23:18.364 --> 23:19.697
Lillian...

23:19.699 --> 23:21.332
The words...

23:21.334 --> 23:22.933
The... The words
that you're saying...

23:22.935 --> 23:26.303
I'm following the script
as you constructed.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.139
Constructed?

23:29.674 --> 23:31.542
(director clears throat)

23:34.012 --> 23:35.413
(dr. Depaul clears throat)

23:35.415 --> 23:36.981
Is she drunk?

23:36.983 --> 23:38.482
No, she's not drunk.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.083
She's just nervous.

23:39.085 --> 23:43.854
Lillian, would you rather
hold the script on camera
to get the words right?

23:43.856 --> 23:46.590
No, my words are fine.
My words are fine.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.625
All right.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.627
Uh, all right.
Well, let's just
start from the top.

23:49.629 --> 23:53.898
No. If the team here
isn't satisfied with my...
(voice breaking)

23:53.900 --> 23:55.399
(sniffles)

23:55.401 --> 23:57.201
(sighs)

23:59.871 --> 24:01.939
(dr. Depaul crying)

24:07.245 --> 24:08.813
Lillian.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.781
The lights.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.249
It's too hot.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.652
It wasn't the lights.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.288
You weren't
making any sense.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.389
And a couple of weeks ago,

24:18.391 --> 24:22.226
You had a bruise that you
couldn't or wouldn't explain.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.695
I wanted pamphlets.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.398
You wanted a movie.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.366
(sniffles)

24:30.168 --> 24:32.269
"let's make the
program bigger.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.638
"let's make it more...

24:35.340 --> 24:36.440
"bigger."

24:36.442 --> 24:37.007
What?

24:37.009 --> 24:39.743
Dr. Johnson,
nothing is ever
big enough for you.

24:39.745 --> 24:40.711
Your eye...

24:40.713 --> 24:43.747
Is always on
some other prize.

24:45.350 --> 24:46.717
It's true.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.152
I'm not going
to stand here

24:48.154 --> 24:50.955
And defend myself
to you or anybody.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.990
You need to see a doctor.
I am a doctor.

24:52.992 --> 24:53.791
A doctor not pigheaded

24:53.793 --> 24:57.595
And suffering from
a severe case of pride.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.598
Yours must be
in here somewhere.

25:21.887 --> 25:23.621
Rose?

25:24.890 --> 25:26.090
I'm dr. Masters.

25:26.092 --> 25:29.493
I want you to know that
the bleeding's stopped.

25:29.495 --> 25:31.462
You're safe.

25:32.664 --> 25:36.233
I also want
you to know that I...
I've been talking

25:36.235 --> 25:41.205
To your mother who wants me
to perform another surgery.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.239
I know.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.376
You're aware of what
she wants me to do?

25:45.378 --> 25:49.113
Just make sure it's
done before my cotillion.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.915
Mother spent
a fortune on my dress,

25:50.917 --> 25:52.082
If she hasn't
already told you.

25:52.084 --> 25:55.786
I'll tell your mother
that you refused
the hysterectomy.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.355
No, I didn't say that.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.329
Will you do it?

26:05.331 --> 26:08.332
I mean,
maybe it will help.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.502
Rose...

26:13.505 --> 26:15.406
If you're trying to
protect your mother...

26:15.408 --> 26:18.075
My mother
doesn't need protection.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.677
I do.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.679
I don't understand.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.314
Of course
you don't understand.

26:23.316 --> 26:26.150
Nobody understands
what this feels like.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.686
Well, I can try.

26:32.657 --> 26:37.628
It's like there's
this dark thing
inside of me...

26:37.630 --> 26:38.796
Starving.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.564
(voice breaking)
and every time

26:40.566 --> 26:43.601
That I think about
a boy, or a man,

26:43.603 --> 26:45.402
I can't stop
until I have him.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.671
It's like no matter
what my brain says,

26:47.673 --> 26:50.574
This other part,
it's like...

26:51.309 --> 26:54.044
It's like it's against me.

26:55.180 --> 27:00.317
It just wants,
and when it wants,
everything else just...

27:00.319 --> 27:02.386
Goes away.

27:03.722 --> 27:04.788
And then after...

27:04.790 --> 27:09.526
When I think
about what I've done...

27:10.762 --> 27:12.129
What I am...

27:12.131 --> 27:14.264
Rose, uh...

27:14.733 --> 27:17.935
Whatever feelings
you might have,

27:17.937 --> 27:21.038
If you go through
with this surgery,

27:21.573 --> 27:23.807
You will never
have children.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.544
What kind of mother
would I be anyway?

27:28.046 --> 27:30.080
I don't want these
sick thoughts anymore.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.849
I don't want
to feel ashamed.

27:31.851 --> 27:38.622
So if taking
out a part of me
makes it go away...

27:40.358 --> 27:42.326
Do it.

27:43.361 --> 27:45.763
Cut it out of me.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.805
(radio chatter)

27:55.807 --> 27:58.375
Oh, here.
Let me show you
how to fold it.

27:58.377 --> 28:03.080
Dr. Masters
is very particular
about his shirts.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.115
They all look
pretty much the same.

28:05.117 --> 28:08.419
(chuckles)
it makes shopping
for him easy.

28:12.223 --> 28:14.058
May I ask
how that happened?

28:14.060 --> 28:15.693
A grease fire
when I was nine.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.428
I was cooking
for my brothers.

28:17.430 --> 28:20.764
My aunt come over,
wrapped it in honey.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.132
Was your mother working?

28:22.134 --> 28:25.302
Mama had passed
a few months earlier.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.604
Hmm.
My mother did also...

28:27.606 --> 28:31.008
Uh, pass that is,
when I was eight.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.976
Here.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.779
Boiling oatmeal
when I was 11.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.581
Not quite as dramatic.
(chuckles)

28:37.583 --> 28:40.818
Might be best we both
stay out the kitchen.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.820
(chuckles)

28:47.058 --> 28:49.626
My aunt says hard men
do the best doctoring.

28:49.628 --> 28:53.764
'cause they
don't waste time
talking about the weather

28:53.766 --> 28:56.066
And other nonsense.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.135
They get to the point.

28:58.137 --> 29:01.972
Well, bill does
get to the point.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.707
No small talk either.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.876
I loved that about him
when we first met.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.277
Made him seem
so substantial.

29:07.279 --> 29:11.982
Like a man whose greatness
couldn't be interrupted
by idle chit-chat.

29:11.984 --> 29:15.452
(chuckles)
sometimes a chat is good.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.021
Sometimes a chat
is essential.

29:18.023 --> 29:21.158
Sometimes it's fun or sweet.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.428
I could chat about
baby john for hours.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.497
That is one nice baby.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.832
Thought he would
do the trick.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.435
For bill, I mean.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.870
Having our son.

29:32.872 --> 29:36.974
I mean, I... I knew
that my husband was

29:36.976 --> 29:39.676
Reticent about children.

29:39.744 --> 29:42.412
I know bill didn't have
a happy childhood,

29:42.414 --> 29:47.317
But again, no chitchat,
so I'm vague on the details.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.952
If you can believe that.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.921
After all these years.

29:51.489 --> 29:53.357
I was just
so sure that...

29:53.359 --> 29:55.392
That when bill finally
held his own child,

29:55.394 --> 29:58.896
All that worried him
and hurt him,

29:58.898 --> 30:01.565
It would all
just melt away.

30:01.567 --> 30:06.403
But instead,
it's like he's worse.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.739
More cut off.

30:10.275 --> 30:11.642
Like he's...

30:11.644 --> 30:18.182
Scared of that perfect,
innocent, beautiful boy.

30:20.451 --> 30:25.489
Who ever heard of
a grown man being
afraid of his own child?

30:29.594 --> 30:31.461
Thank you.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.232
I know, and the
report is due on Thursday.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.166
Woman: Monday.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.101
Okay, perfect.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.673
Dr. Masters. Are you...

30:42.675 --> 30:45.108
I was waiting for you.

30:46.744 --> 30:48.212
Tennis injury.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.380
It was clumsy.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.783
That reminds me
of when you were 10,

30:52.785 --> 30:56.587
And your tennis
teacher, the...
The pro at your club...

30:56.589 --> 30:58.288
Flip.
Flip. Yes.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.623
You trounced flip.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.225
Destroyed him
on the court.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.259
In fact,
from that day on,

31:02.261 --> 31:05.863
It was difficult
to find an adult that
you couldn't beat.

31:05.865 --> 31:09.333
Your dad was
so proud of that.

31:12.203 --> 31:17.307
Vivian, I don't think
that you broke your
arm playing tennis.

31:18.376 --> 31:22.045
It was like one of those
slow-motion nightmares.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.014
My mother and I both
saw him hanging there,

31:24.016 --> 31:25.816
But it was almost
like for a second

31:25.818 --> 31:28.352
Our brains couldn't put
the pieces together.

31:28.354 --> 31:31.321
He had this electrical cord
digging into his neck,

31:31.323 --> 31:34.024
And his feet were kicking.

31:34.026 --> 31:34.791
It was only a few seconds,

31:34.793 --> 31:38.896
But it felt like forever
before we realized
what was happening,

31:38.898 --> 31:40.297
That...

31:40.299 --> 31:44.134
That my father had actually
done this to himself.

31:44.669 --> 31:48.071
I probably
shouldn't be telling
you this, it's just...

31:48.073 --> 31:52.743
Well, daddy thought the sun
rises and sets with you.

31:52.745 --> 31:55.846
Mama says daddy's been under
a lot of stress at work.

31:55.848 --> 31:59.750
He apparently almost
got fired from maternity.
Can you imagine?

31:59.752 --> 32:04.955
But then you left,
and mama said that
was very hard for him.

32:04.957 --> 32:08.592
But it had to be
an accident, right?

32:10.061 --> 32:13.196
You know how sometimes
you just feel so heartsick,

32:13.198 --> 32:15.098
And everything
seems so hopeless?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.066
(crying)
so for just a minute,

32:16.068 --> 32:20.537
You forget that
there are people who
love you so much...

32:21.005 --> 32:23.640
That you have a family.

32:24.208 --> 32:27.244
I'm not making much sense.

32:28.146 --> 32:29.680
Is he really in venice?

32:29.682 --> 32:33.016
The postmarks
are from europe.

32:33.217 --> 32:37.754
Mama writes every day,
and she said that
he's feeling better.

32:37.756 --> 32:41.658
He always said he wanted
to see the tower of pisa.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.494
He said,
"800 years of leaning.

32:44.496 --> 32:49.032
"can you imagine how tired
that tower must be?"

32:50.768 --> 32:53.370
He will get better,
won't he?

32:53.372 --> 32:56.506
He just needs some rest
and he'll be okay?

32:56.508 --> 33:01.011
He... He just...
Needs some rest.

33:12.590 --> 33:15.158
(breathing shakily)

33:27.805 --> 33:29.406
Hi.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.375
Um, we were driving in
this morning,

33:31.377 --> 33:32.509
And I thought,
"funny, isn't it,

33:32.511 --> 33:36.113
"how overnight,
something so cuckoo
can seem normal as pie?"

33:36.115 --> 33:37.881
Oh, speaking of pies,

33:37.883 --> 33:40.283
Gene's been
driving us by carondelet's
every morning now.

33:40.285 --> 33:43.086
It's like a... (chuckles)
it's like our little ritual.

33:43.088 --> 33:45.489
He calls it
the "treatment treat."

33:45.491 --> 33:48.492
Apricot cruller for him,
powdered sugar for me.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.694
And this morning,
I got you a danish.
It's prune.

33:50.696 --> 33:55.165
Does it ever
occur to you that I have
patients in actual need,

33:55.167 --> 33:55.999
People that are sick,

33:56.001 --> 33:58.135
People that are
desperate for real help?

33:58.137 --> 33:59.703
So forget the prune.

33:59.705 --> 34:00.937
This is not a joke, betty.

34:00.939 --> 34:03.774
You will put an end to this
shameful charade today.

34:03.776 --> 34:04.841
Because if
you don't, I will.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.644
I will tell your
husband myself.

34:07.646 --> 34:08.412
No. No, you won't.

34:08.414 --> 34:11.081
Because you care too much
about your dopey sex study.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.316
That study is
anything but dopey.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.152
You have no idea
how people are suffering!

34:15.154 --> 34:19.022
You... You do not lecture
me on suffering ever.

34:19.024 --> 34:21.425
'cause what I've seen
of suffering

34:21.427 --> 34:24.861
Makes all this look
like amateur hour.

34:27.698 --> 34:30.801
Uh, dr. Greathouse
is waiting in your off...

34:30.803 --> 34:34.304
For you, babs.
Prune danish. Eat it.

34:35.940 --> 34:39.376
You were supposed
to perform the already
agreed upon surgery.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.343
I never agreed.

34:40.345 --> 34:42.112
You violated my orders!

34:42.114 --> 34:43.080
And now I have to
clean up this mess!

34:43.082 --> 34:46.149
That girl
deserves a chance
at a normal life.

34:46.151 --> 34:47.651
Normal?

34:47.653 --> 34:49.786
Sneaking out all
hours of the night

34:49.788 --> 34:52.222
Screwing every
tom, dick, and harry?

34:52.224 --> 34:53.090
You think that's normal?

34:53.092 --> 34:57.561
What if that
was your daughter
acting like a whore?

34:58.663 --> 35:00.997
You know,
for hundreds of years,

35:00.999 --> 35:04.468
People who fall
outside the bounds of
"normal" sexual behavior

35:04.470 --> 35:07.838
Have been labeled
deviant, amoral, whores.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.274
But that kind of
thinking, doug, is just
reactionary and stupid.

35:11.276 --> 35:14.511
There are
sexual dysfunctions
in this world.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.245
They are real.

35:15.247 --> 35:17.614
Maybe psychological,
maybe neurological.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.381
Sexual dysfunctions?

35:18.383 --> 35:20.584
Nymphomania,
fetishists, homosexuals.

35:20.586 --> 35:23.787
Also known as sluts,
perverts, and queers.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.622
Bill, is this
our role now,

35:25.624 --> 35:27.891
To take a deficiency
of character

35:27.893 --> 35:28.959
And label it a disease?

35:28.961 --> 35:31.461
If it means putting
the truth center stage,

35:31.463 --> 35:33.830
No matter how
uncomfortable, yes.

35:34.365 --> 35:36.333
Well, regardless,
the board are on me.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.069
I'm going to have to
oversee your surgeries.

35:39.071 --> 35:40.337
You can't be serious.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.872
Just a couple
months at the most,

35:41.874 --> 35:44.207
And then I'll stop
breathing down your neck,

35:44.209 --> 35:46.543
Provided that you behave.

35:47.345 --> 35:51.114
Now let's drop
this dreary subject

35:51.116 --> 35:54.818
And move on to the thing
that interests us both.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.819
The sex study.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.922
How's it going on
my new favorite project?

35:59.891 --> 36:01.691
We started off with
a simple camera lens

36:01.693 --> 36:05.462
And enough light
to illuminate the vaginal
cavity without distortion.

36:05.464 --> 36:09.099
But then we
modified the device
into a movie camera

36:09.101 --> 36:13.570
To capture
physiological phenomena
in actual living color.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.938
And why couldn't
it be modified

36:14.940 --> 36:16.940
To do the same
for gastroenterology?

36:16.942 --> 36:18.808
I think it could be.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.143
May I see?

36:20.145 --> 36:21.578
Of course.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.016
(gasps lightly)

36:27.451 --> 36:31.755
And, uh, what kind of
data were you able to
gather with ulysses?

36:31.757 --> 36:35.625
The study had documented
26 physiological responses

36:35.627 --> 36:38.929
To various internal
and external stimulation.

36:38.931 --> 36:39.462
Heart rate,

36:39.464 --> 36:42.098
Brain waves,
blood flow to
all sexual organs,

36:42.100 --> 36:44.768
Both male and female,
in addition to...

36:44.770 --> 36:46.736
You mean
the vasocongestion

36:46.738 --> 36:48.305
That occurs
before intercourse?

36:48.307 --> 36:50.006
So you did
read our study.

36:50.008 --> 36:50.707
I flipped through it.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.877
(chuckling) the tax code
makes for better reading.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.980
I want to get into the
ground-breaking research.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.182
What you read
is ground-breaking.

36:59.184 --> 37:02.953
Well, what about
different kinds of sex?

37:02.955 --> 37:04.921
Different how?

37:04.923 --> 37:07.290
Point of entry,
for example.

37:07.292 --> 37:13.129
I mean,
everything doesn't
have to go into...

37:13.131 --> 37:15.765
Into the vagina.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.568
(chuckles lightly)

37:18.570 --> 37:19.803
But...

37:19.805 --> 37:22.439
The length and...
And width.

37:22.441 --> 37:26.009
A woman's vagina
can accommodate
a baby's head,

37:26.011 --> 37:27.844
Let's not forget.

37:28.045 --> 37:29.379
But how did
the subjects respond

37:29.381 --> 37:32.415
Once such a large
phallus was inserted?

37:32.917 --> 37:34.384
Respond as in...

37:34.386 --> 37:36.052
What did it feel
like for the women?

37:36.054 --> 37:38.288
Was there discomfort?
Pleasure?

37:38.290 --> 37:38.922
There was pleasure.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.625
It's designed for...
For pleasure.

37:41.627 --> 37:45.662
But you would be
observing the esophagus,
not the vagina.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.931
Well, both organs
do secrete fluids.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.033
Glands in the mouth
produce saliva.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.434
The vagina
actually lubricates

37:51.436 --> 37:54.404
In a way that more
resembles sweating.

37:56.140 --> 37:59.843
Can you tell me
more about that?

37:59.845 --> 38:02.679
The position of a penis
as it enters the vagina

38:02.681 --> 38:05.682
Is something that can,
of course, vary considerably.

38:05.684 --> 38:09.319
We have collected
data documenting
dozens of positions.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.620
Male superior,
female superior...

38:10.622 --> 38:11.755
So, if a man
and a woman

38:11.757 --> 38:16.026
Want to do it hanging
from their ankles off
the macarthur bridge,

38:16.028 --> 38:18.928
Your attitude basically
is "whatever works"?

38:18.930 --> 38:23.833
Well, our data reveals
that physical agility
can play a role,

38:23.835 --> 38:27.070
But essentially,
where there's a will...

38:27.072 --> 38:28.938
The way sweat collects

38:28.940 --> 38:31.474
To prepare
the vaginal walls

38:31.476 --> 38:33.143
For penile insertion...

38:33.145 --> 38:33.910
And thrusting.

38:33.912 --> 38:38.615
But again,
how would this apply
to the esophagus?

38:38.617 --> 38:40.283
What you feel
in one organ

38:40.285 --> 38:42.919
Can easily be
replicated in another.

38:42.921 --> 38:45.588
The sensation,
the feeling of it is...

38:45.590 --> 38:48.725
But your patients
would be anesthetized.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.761
They will
still have to
accommodate this device.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.163
This tool.

38:53.165 --> 38:55.365
This enormous phallus.

38:55.367 --> 38:58.034
Big enough to induce
vaginal sweating,

38:58.036 --> 39:01.604
Secretions that will coat
a woman's insides...

39:01.606 --> 39:03.873
Dr. Ditmer...
Don't you see, virginia?

39:03.875 --> 39:04.641
Mrs. Johnson.

39:04.643 --> 39:07.610
Gastroenterology
is the study

39:07.612 --> 39:09.779
Of the entire
alimentary canal.

39:09.781 --> 39:15.251
All the way from
a woman's mouth
down to her...

39:15.253 --> 39:17.087
(shudders)

39:19.190 --> 39:21.124
Oh...

39:21.126 --> 39:23.226
(gasps)

39:25.529 --> 39:29.132
"to bruise her breast
immune to pain,

39:29.134 --> 39:31.901
"to make in her
astonished flank

39:31.903 --> 39:34.571
"a wide and gaping wound."

39:34.573 --> 39:37.407
<i>Fleurs du mal.</i> Baudelaire.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.942
You've read him, of course.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.411
Somehow I missed
<i>flowers of evil.</i>

39:41.413 --> 39:41.778
Hmm.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.847
For a frenchman,
he knew a lot
about the greek way.

39:43.849 --> 39:48.418
You know, they didn't invent
olive oil just for cooking.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.955
I think this is a significant
direction for our new study.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.623
(knocking on door)

39:53.625 --> 39:54.224
(door opens)

39:54.226 --> 39:57.894
Dr. Greathouse,
you wanted me to
remind you about your 9:30.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.897
I did, barbara.
Thank you.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.203
(door closes)

40:09.340 --> 40:11.841
You know something, bill?

40:11.843 --> 40:14.043
It is a rare bird

40:14.045 --> 40:16.913
That understands
that particular call.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.816
And trust me,
they're out there.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.118
And when you have
one in the hand,

40:22.353 --> 40:25.422
You don't even bother
with the bush.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.527
(door slams)

40:30.529 --> 40:32.395
(sighs)

40:32.630 --> 40:34.931
(elevator bell dings)

40:38.235 --> 40:40.170
Hold the elevator!

40:41.605 --> 40:43.673
(papers thud)

40:48.846 --> 40:52.148
I'm finishing up
with mrs. Delessi's
blood work,

40:52.150 --> 40:53.416
But you're free to go.

40:53.418 --> 40:54.784
We have an appointment.

40:54.786 --> 40:58.955
Tomorrow at 2:00
with your oncologist.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.835
Hey, virginia.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.305
I want to show you
something in my office.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.674
(indistinct conversations)
(music playing)

41:17.676 --> 41:19.175
Come on.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.010
(chuckles)

41:21.312 --> 41:23.913
You really are
one of the lost boys.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.515
<i>♪ let's fall in love</i>

41:25.517 --> 41:29.252
<i>♪ the dutch</i>
<i>in old amsterdam do it ♪</i>

41:29.254 --> 41:33.156
So this is your
answer to getting
kicked out of your house

41:33.158 --> 41:34.491
And your life
being a shambles?

41:34.493 --> 41:37.794
Woman: Sorry.
You got a better answer?

41:38.195 --> 41:39.195
No.

41:39.197 --> 41:43.166
<i>♪ some argentines,</i>
<i>without means do it ♪</i>

41:43.168 --> 41:45.902
You know what
they tell you to do
when you're driving

41:45.904 --> 41:49.539
On a slippery surface
and you lose control?

41:49.773 --> 41:51.174
Scream.

41:51.176 --> 41:52.675
That's what most people do.

41:52.677 --> 41:53.376
They panic.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.879
They, uh, slam on the brakes,
end up skidding into a ditch.

41:55.881 --> 41:59.382
What you're supposed
to do is hit the gas
and steer into the skid.

41:59.384 --> 42:02.051
The car automatically
straightens itself out.

42:02.053 --> 42:03.386
That's all I'm doing.

42:03.388 --> 42:07.524
I'm hitting the gas
and I'm steering
into the skid.

42:07.526 --> 42:10.193
Well,
still feels like a ditch.

42:11.762 --> 42:14.097
(chuckles) come on.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.265
I'm sorry, austin.

42:15.267 --> 42:18.368
You're very gifted when
it comes to crepe paper.

42:18.370 --> 42:20.970
(music continues)

42:23.974 --> 42:24.941
Care to dance?

42:24.943 --> 42:27.577
Well,
it seems impossible
for the staff here

42:27.579 --> 42:29.946
To think any less of me.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.315
I think that might do it.

42:32.683 --> 42:34.517
Do you really care?

42:39.623 --> 42:41.958
(music continues)

42:43.093 --> 42:44.494
Although I do
take your point.

42:44.496 --> 42:46.896
We've hit a rough patch,
you and I.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.698
We'll bounce back.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.733
We're a team now?

42:50.735 --> 42:53.970
Well, not in
a romantic way.

42:53.972 --> 42:56.472
Do you know
why we will never be
together in that way?

42:56.474 --> 42:58.675
It's hard to know
where to start.

42:58.677 --> 43:01.844
Ha-ha-ha. Well,
because we're lone wolves.

43:01.846 --> 43:06.015
Driven from the pack
by our refusal to conform.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.083
Is that it?

43:07.085 --> 43:09.819
You sure we
weren't asked to leave

43:09.821 --> 43:13.256
Because we couldn't play nice
with the other wolves?

43:13.258 --> 43:16.225
Lone wolves don't
always play nice.

43:16.227 --> 43:18.561
They're wild, unpredictable,

43:18.563 --> 43:20.930
Always on the
hunt for new prey.

43:20.932 --> 43:22.332
(scoffs)

43:22.334 --> 43:24.867
Well, that sounds lonely.

43:26.704 --> 43:30.373
You know what's four
floors directly beneath us?

43:31.809 --> 43:34.010
The morgue.

43:34.012 --> 43:35.945
That's lonely.

43:37.781 --> 43:40.183
We're dancing.

43:42.553 --> 43:44.954
(music continues)

43:49.460 --> 43:50.793
I just want to go home.

43:50.795 --> 43:52.362
I need to
talk to you first.

43:52.364 --> 43:53.563
Well, I won't listen.

43:53.565 --> 43:56.933
I asked you, I begged you
to perform that surgery.

43:56.935 --> 43:59.736
I know you did.
I know.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.404
But, rose...

44:01.406 --> 44:04.307
Doctors take an oath,
the hippocratic oath,

44:04.309 --> 44:08.845
Which says
"first, do no harm."

44:08.847 --> 44:12.315
That surgery would have
harmed you irreparably.

44:12.317 --> 44:14.117
I couldn't live with that.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.619
Who cares about you?

44:17.221 --> 44:19.489
Four years ago,

44:19.491 --> 44:23.793
The polio virus killed half
a million people each year.

44:23.795 --> 44:25.828
Now, thanks to
dr. Jonas salk,

44:25.830 --> 44:29.465
We will likely see polio
eradicated in our lifetime.

44:29.467 --> 44:31.167
My problem is not polio.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.670
I know what
your problem is.

44:36.306 --> 44:38.675
This is an intrauterine
device, or iud.

44:38.677 --> 44:41.944
It's been used since
the turn of the century,

44:41.946 --> 44:45.615
But dr. Jack lippes
recently refined it

44:45.617 --> 44:48.418
Using something
called thermoplastics,

44:48.420 --> 44:50.086
Making it the
most effective

44:50.088 --> 44:54.257
And simple method
of birth control
available today.

44:54.259 --> 44:56.359
Birth control?

44:56.660 --> 44:57.694
My mother
would never allow that.

44:57.696 --> 45:00.196
You're 18
and don't need your
mother's permission.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.699
As your doctor,
I am telling you,

45:02.701 --> 45:05.802
This is the first step...

45:05.936 --> 45:08.371
In solving your problem.

45:12.543 --> 45:16.012
Some little thing
made out of plastic?

45:16.014 --> 45:19.649
How is that
supposed to stop me
from acting like a whore?

45:19.651 --> 45:21.150
Don't...

45:21.152 --> 45:24.087
Don't say that
ever again, rose.

45:25.656 --> 45:27.623
There is...

45:28.058 --> 45:31.694
Such promise
of hope ahead.

45:31.696 --> 45:35.798
You are not gonna
have to suffer
like this forever.

45:35.800 --> 45:40.636
But while we
wait for the answers
that will surely come,

45:40.871 --> 45:44.874
The least we can do
is make sure you don't
get pregnant again.

45:44.876 --> 45:47.076
(baby wailing)

45:47.678 --> 45:50.279
Hunger, gas.

45:50.481 --> 45:51.981
You're not wet.

45:51.983 --> 45:54.650
What are the other
reasons a baby cries?

45:54.652 --> 45:56.686
Babies like
a tight swaddle.

45:56.688 --> 45:59.222
I'm gonna heat
another bottle.

45:59.224 --> 46:01.758
(wailing continues)

46:09.566 --> 46:10.466
You're home late.

46:10.468 --> 46:12.835
Did something go wrong
at the new job?

46:12.837 --> 46:15.371
The new job is fine.

46:15.373 --> 46:17.573
Seems home
is a different story.

46:17.575 --> 46:18.908
He's only crying
because he's hungry.

46:18.910 --> 46:20.576
I was about
to heat a bottle.

46:20.578 --> 46:22.945
(wailing continues)

46:24.715 --> 46:26.949
(wailing stops)

46:29.987 --> 46:32.088
(sighs)

46:34.424 --> 46:37.760
Swaddle needed
to be tighter is all.

46:38.262 --> 46:41.330
I think I might have
mentioned his swaddle.

46:41.332 --> 46:42.665
And I been
telling miss libby

46:42.667 --> 46:44.200
About my auntie's
swaddle all day.

46:44.202 --> 46:48.671
(chuckles)
my auntie was the
queen of the swaddles.

46:52.276 --> 46:54.911
Long may she reign.

46:57.681 --> 47:00.783
Maybe you were
right about the girl.

47:01.151 --> 47:03.820
She does seem...

47:04.788 --> 47:06.856
Competent.

47:16.934 --> 47:19.202
Um, I need to talk
to you about something.

47:19.204 --> 47:21.938
About rose, that girl
with the witch of a mother,

47:21.940 --> 47:22.905
Trying to yank
out her uterus.

47:22.907 --> 47:25.241
Have you been looking
through my patient files?

47:25.243 --> 47:29.245
The way you
were yelling, people in
space know about rose.

47:29.247 --> 47:32.515
My point is, I know
these kind of situations,

47:32.517 --> 47:36.319
And you need to talk to her,
have a real heart-to-heart...

47:36.321 --> 47:40.056
I will not discuss
my patients with you ever.

47:40.058 --> 47:42.058
Is that clear?

47:42.459 --> 47:43.960
'cause you
know everything!

47:43.962 --> 47:45.494
Ooh! I'm sorry.

47:45.496 --> 47:46.028
Can I help?

47:46.030 --> 47:50.633
Oh, my god.
$50 shoe, and it breaks
just like the $5 kind.

47:50.635 --> 47:53.903
You're making
house calls now?

47:53.905 --> 47:55.204
Thanks for your concern.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.672
You don't remember me,
do you?

47:56.674 --> 47:59.642
Enjoy your day!
Nice to see you again.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.013
Who was that?

48:04.015 --> 48:06.916
Nobody.
Good samaritan.

48:06.918 --> 48:08.985
(elevator bell dings)

48:25.569 --> 48:27.536
(door closes)

48:51.461 --> 48:56.632
<i>Positively the...</i>
<i>The original hellfire</i>
<i>and brimstone speech.</i>

48:56.634 --> 48:58.601
<i>It looked like</i>
<i>to be more than...</i>

48:58.603 --> 48:59.402
Woman:  <i>You needn't worry.</i>

48:59.404 --> 49:03.039
<i>It isn't you</i>
<i>I intend to hurt,</i>
<i>it's your brother carl.</i>

49:03.041 --> 49:05.374
<i>So don't worry, then.</i>

49:05.376 --> 49:07.476
You seem to like
television stories better.

49:07.478 --> 49:10.346
I mean, compared
to the radio stories.

49:10.348 --> 49:12.548
We do love tv.

49:12.550 --> 49:14.517
At night, my brothers
watch westerns.

49:14.519 --> 49:16.852
Mmm.
<i>Wagon train,</i>
<i>bat masterson.</i>

49:16.854 --> 49:19.488
But come 1:00,
it's  <i>love of life.</i>

49:19.490 --> 49:23.326
(chuckles) I don't care
what type of fit they throw.

49:23.328 --> 49:26.562
Of course,
I work here at 1:00, so...

49:26.564 --> 49:30.099
I appreciate you
turning it on for me.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.568
In the summertime
when the boys are home,

49:32.570 --> 49:35.604
I "ax" my auntie
if I can watch it
at her place.

49:35.606 --> 49:39.642
Mainly so they
don't interrupt me with
all their roughhousing.

49:39.644 --> 49:41.877
"ask."
ma'am?

49:43.213 --> 49:45.414
"ask." uh, you said "ax."

49:45.416 --> 49:48.651
The proper pronunciation
is "ask."

49:49.519 --> 49:52.154
Oh. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.823
Oh, you don't
have to apologize.

49:53.825 --> 49:55.458
I'm always grateful
when someone points out

49:55.460 --> 49:58.461
Something I could
do better.

49:58.729 --> 50:00.830
Give it a go.

50:02.265 --> 50:03.199
Go?

50:03.201 --> 50:06.435
The pronunciation, "ask."

50:09.006 --> 50:10.506
Ax.

50:11.308 --> 50:13.042
No.

50:13.044 --> 50:15.511
Uh, "ask."

50:18.548 --> 50:20.349
"ask."

50:21.151 --> 50:21.717
In the future,

50:21.719 --> 50:24.954
It would get confusing
if the baby's talking
one way with you

50:24.956 --> 50:26.022
And another with me.

50:26.024 --> 50:28.557
Since we'll be the two
essentially raising him,

50:28.559 --> 50:32.595
It seems a good
idea the two of us
operate as a team.

50:32.597 --> 50:34.897
Don't you think?

50:36.700 --> 50:38.768
Yes, ma'am.

50:48.712 --> 50:51.313
I am so sorry, lillian.

50:56.453 --> 50:58.788
Metastasis was
always a possibility.

50:58.790 --> 51:01.190
But surely
there are options.

51:01.192 --> 51:02.992
What are our options?

51:03.193 --> 51:04.427
It's a good question.

51:04.429 --> 51:07.096
Lillian, you should
probably get dressed.

51:07.098 --> 51:08.631
We can meet in my office,

51:08.633 --> 51:11.000
Go over what's possible
and what's not.

51:11.002 --> 51:14.170
I don't want anyone
to know about this.

51:16.373 --> 51:19.241
Of course.
I won't say anything.

51:26.183 --> 51:27.083
I'll give you your privacy.

51:27.085 --> 51:30.519
A little late for that,
don't you think?

51:32.622 --> 51:33.622
Virginia.

51:33.624 --> 51:35.958
What good did this do?

51:38.728 --> 51:39.829
I...

51:39.831 --> 51:41.530
I know what
to research now.

51:41.532 --> 51:44.967
You're going to
research my metastasized,
terminal cancer?

51:44.969 --> 51:47.570
Is that so
hard to believe?

51:50.340 --> 51:52.108
Then you don't know me.

51:52.110 --> 51:53.042
But I know you.

51:53.044 --> 51:56.045
And you are
a fighter, lillian.
So am I.

51:56.047 --> 51:58.481
And so that is what
we are going to do.

51:58.483 --> 51:59.915
We are going to fight.

51:59.917 --> 52:04.253
Well, every good
fight begins with pizza.

52:05.689 --> 52:07.790
You said "pizza."

52:07.792 --> 52:10.025
What did you mean to say?

52:10.027 --> 52:10.860
Pizza.

52:10.862 --> 52:11.760
After we talk to dr. Lyons,

52:11.762 --> 52:14.964
Is there someplace close to
here that serves pizza?

52:16.133 --> 52:19.101
Gaetano's,
a couple blocks away.

52:19.103 --> 52:21.237
I don't eat pizza.
I don't even like it.

52:21.239 --> 52:24.106
But suddenly
I'm craving pizza.

52:29.880 --> 52:34.783
Woman:  <i>Technician marshall,</i>
<i>please report to x-ray.</i>

52:39.723 --> 52:41.457
Rose palmateer?

52:41.459 --> 52:44.693
For me?
Who are they from?

52:44.695 --> 52:46.695
Oh, uh, no card.

52:46.697 --> 52:48.998
Probably a secret admirer.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.033
Well...

52:51.468 --> 52:53.302
Thank you.

52:53.304 --> 52:55.871
Oh, I didn't catch...
Oh, I'm betty.

52:55.873 --> 52:59.842
Yeah, just one of
the hospital busy bees.

52:59.844 --> 53:02.878
I also work
with doc masters.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.346
Oh. He's my doctor.

53:04.348 --> 53:06.715
Oh, is that so?

53:06.717 --> 53:08.551
So...
So you're leaving, then?

53:08.553 --> 53:11.453
Yeah, my mom's
gonna come pick me up.

53:16.493 --> 53:20.362
It's... It's funny
with mothers, isn't it?

53:20.364 --> 53:22.264
One of my earliest
memories of hospitals,

53:22.266 --> 53:24.633
Uh, my mother
had to go to one.

53:24.635 --> 53:29.805
She had an accident, uh,
ended up blind in one eye.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.340
And it had to be removed.

53:31.342 --> 53:35.578
Um, she had a glass eye
till the day she died.

53:35.580 --> 53:38.047
I'm sorry to hear that.

53:38.782 --> 53:40.616
Actually,
I did it to her.

53:40.618 --> 53:47.323
See, my mother
had a habit of making
me feel real lousy.

53:47.325 --> 53:48.524
She would call me a tramp,

53:48.526 --> 53:53.262
She would say
I was a disgrace
to her and myself.

53:53.264 --> 53:58.400
And I took it
for the longest time,

53:58.402 --> 53:59.101
Her opinion of me,

53:59.103 --> 54:03.606
Until one day,
I don't even know
what set it off,

54:03.608 --> 54:06.141
But I took off
one of my pumps...

54:06.143 --> 54:08.310
It had one of those
real pointy heels,

54:08.312 --> 54:12.848
And I stabbed her
right in the eye with it.

54:13.750 --> 54:18.120
Not that blinding people
is the best way,

54:18.122 --> 54:19.655
Uh, but... (sighs)

54:19.657 --> 54:23.692
There's a life lesson
in there somewhere

54:23.694 --> 54:26.795
About standing up
for yourself.

54:26.797 --> 54:31.500
A life lesson
I am happy to pass on.

54:31.502 --> 54:34.803
You talked to
dr. Masters about me?

54:34.805 --> 54:37.539
Oh, he didn't
say a thing.

54:37.541 --> 54:39.541
I swear. I snooped.

54:39.543 --> 54:41.543
I feel better now anyway.

54:41.545 --> 54:44.713
I'm very grateful
for what he said.

54:44.715 --> 54:45.547
He said something useful?

54:45.549 --> 54:50.653
(chuckles)
he said that I'm just
somebody who needs help,

54:50.655 --> 54:52.021
Like all of us.

54:52.023 --> 54:54.089
And then he said,

54:54.091 --> 54:57.026
"I'll tell you
what you're not, rose.

54:57.028 --> 55:00.095
"you're not
your worst part."

55:01.598 --> 55:05.034
(voice breaking)
I'm not my worst part.

55:07.370 --> 55:08.437
In the morning.

55:08.439 --> 55:11.106
The case just
came in, so I...

55:11.108 --> 55:12.875
Fairly late I'm afraid.

55:12.877 --> 55:15.377
Libby:  <i>I can keep</i>
<i>your dinner warm.</i>

55:15.379 --> 55:18.814
No, lib. Don't wait.
Don't wait. Uh...

55:18.816 --> 55:20.015
I'll eat here.

55:20.017 --> 55:21.617
You should
get some sleep.

55:21.619 --> 55:26.088
<i>True. I am so beat.</i>
<i>In the morning, then?</i>

55:26.090 --> 55:28.290
In the morning.

55:39.536 --> 55:40.602
It might be late.

55:40.604 --> 55:42.705
This day has been,
well, a crazy one,

55:42.707 --> 55:45.240
And if I don't finish
my paperwork...

55:45.242 --> 55:46.108
Don't worry, virginia.

55:46.110 --> 55:47.943
The kids are already down.
I can sit here.

55:47.945 --> 55:49.411
I have loads of
homework to finish.

55:49.413 --> 55:51.080
(sighs) well,
I appreciate it, pam.

55:51.082 --> 55:55.050
You do what
you need to do.
Everything here will be fine.

56:11.735 --> 56:13.902
(engine shuts off)
