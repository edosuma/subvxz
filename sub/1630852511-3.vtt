WEBVTT

is on the East Coast.
I need y'all to come through.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.107
<i> - Now that I'm on</i>
<i> the West Coast,</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:10.309
people are all getting together
on the East Coast.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.144
- Where is Chris?
- Why do you give a [bleep]?

00:12.213 --> 00:13.812
- Is the side piece here?

00:13.881 --> 00:16.482
- Angelina, how far away
are we from Old Bridge?

00:16.550 --> 00:18.283
We can go check in
on the side piece.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.186
- [bleep] off. People always
spread rumors about me.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.155
<i> Maybe I should say</i>
<i> I heard rumor about them.</i>

<i> - The Situation</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:37.102
<i> - We're so classy now.</i>

00:37.171 --> 00:39.505
<i> - On the seventh day,</i>

00:39.573 --> 00:42.107
<i> - Get the frig out of here,</i>

- [bleep] off.

00:57.425 --> 01:01.393
- Oh, [bleep]. Oh, damn.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.163
- Just let it go. Let's go on.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.632
- Oh, [bleep] that.
Like, I'm pissed off right now.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.933
No, I'm just pissed.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.736
The roommates always
make up rumors about me.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.404
<i> And I think that they deserve</i>
<i> a little taste</i>

01:12.473 --> 01:13.906
<i> of their own medicine</i>
<i> at this point.</i>

01:15.576 --> 01:18.243
<i> I could definitely come up</i>
<i> with something outrageous,</i>

01:18.312 --> 01:21.113
<i> but, mmm, I don't know</i>
<i> which one it's gonna be.</i>

01:21.182 --> 01:22.714
<i> What about Pauly?</i>
<i> He just kind of, like,</i>

01:22.783 --> 01:24.917
made a joke
about the Old Bridge thing.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.585
<i> Or even freaking Jenni.</i>

01:27.888 --> 01:29.655
<i> But you know what?</i>
<i> Vinny's not here.</i>

01:29.723 --> 01:31.056
So at this point,
I'm just gonna [bleep]

01:31.125 --> 01:32.958
with him a little bit.

01:33.027 --> 01:35.194
<i> But what am I gonna say?</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:36.662
[laughs]

01:38.566 --> 01:40.199
Like, what the [bleep]
did you come here for?

01:40.267 --> 01:42.000
- But this is
a monumental moment for me.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.335
I have something really--
- What? Are you pregnant?

01:43.404 --> 01:44.870
- No.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.505
- You [bleep] got
somebody pregnant?

01:46.574 --> 01:48.574
- No, no, no.
- Mmm.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.944
Yo, word on the street
is Vinny got a girl pregnant.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.446
- Oh, damn.
- Oh, my Lord.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.048
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.851
My side piece
didn't get anyone pregnant.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.018
- Angeliners, are you serious?

02:00.087 --> 02:01.019
Or are you joking?
'Cause this is--

02:01.088 --> 02:02.421
- The streets are talking.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.356
This is something that
they always use all the time.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.159
- There was tons of messiness
out in the streets.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.728
- Do you have a boyfriend?
The streets are talking.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.465
<i> - Now it's my turn.</i>
- Oh, stop it. Really?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.000
<i> I'll be honest with you.</i>
<i> I would have heard this.</i>

02:15.069 --> 02:18.470
The Investigations
would have known such.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.373
So I'm thinking to myself,
this may be up a smudgery.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.908
- She's lying.

02:22.977 --> 02:26.545
Angelina and Chris
are just so over

02:26.614 --> 02:28.647
all the drama being about them.

02:28.716 --> 02:32.684
They're like, "How can I get
the attention off of us?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.653
<i> Let me make up a rumor</i>
<i> about Vinny."</i>

02:34.722 --> 02:36.288
- I think she's pranking us,
bro.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.891
I feel really weird right now
that Vinny can't be here

02:38.959 --> 02:42.628
to defend himself with
some crazy, outlandish rumor.

02:42.696 --> 02:46.265
I'm FaceTiming Vinny
the Keto Chooch.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.034
Hey! What's up, side piece?

02:49.103 --> 02:52.304
<i> - What's up, my boo?</i>
- Yo, Chris misses you, bro.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.540
- Congratulations, by the way.
<i> - Heard what?</i>

02:54.608 --> 02:56.041
- I heard you got
somebody pregnant.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.476
- Oh, my God.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.012
- Oh, damn!
<i> - Are you kidding me, bro?</i>

03:00.080 --> 03:02.848
First off, I don't even
believe this rumor.

03:02.917 --> 03:06.185
Secondly, I cannot believe
the fact that, like,

03:06.253 --> 03:09.288
<i> Chris has the audacity</i>
<i> to ask him over FaceTime.</i>

03:09.356 --> 03:12.457
Like, you're spreading
a rumor like corona

03:12.526 --> 03:14.426
was spread around the world.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.228
- He's red. He's red.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.197
- You can't get pregnant
by the mouth.

03:18.265 --> 03:21.567
- This rumor, I would think
that I would know about it.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.001
- Yo, these streets
are talking.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.736
- You would think
that she would tell me

03:24.805 --> 03:27.606
before she would tell Angelina
and Chris.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.875
Obviously, it's not true.

03:29.944 --> 03:31.743
- Cheers to you,
you [bleep] asshole.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.513
All the roomies
have said rumors about me.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.549
So, Vinny,
like, how does it feel?

03:37.618 --> 03:38.550
- All right, bro.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.985
Well, we all miss
you over here.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.820
We're gonna come check you
out in LA some point.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.288
- We miss you, Vin.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.324
This isn't something
you joke about, you know?

03:45.392 --> 03:48.026
So I feel like this
could make things even worse

03:48.095 --> 03:50.329
<i> between Vinny and Angelina</i>
<i> at this point.</i>

03:50.397 --> 03:53.332
<i> It's just gonna be</i>
<i> a frickin' nightmare.</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:55.667
This is a real low blow.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.502
- You miss me the most,
you [bleep]?

03:57.571 --> 04:00.072
- Angelina says, "[bleep] off."

04:00.140 --> 04:02.307
- That was a very
successful call.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.911
- I'm just kind of speechless,
because it's not true.

04:05.980 --> 04:06.912
And it's gossip.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.413
<i> For people who, like,</i>

04:08.482 --> 04:10.782
<i> want people to stay out</i>
<i> of their relationship,</i>

04:10.851 --> 04:15.387
they're getting very messy in,
like, another person's life.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.055
- Are you missing
your side piece?

04:17.124 --> 04:19.258
- Actually, it's weird to be
in New Jersey

04:19.326 --> 04:21.126
without my side piece.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.395
- But he has been more active
in group chat lately.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.264
- He has.
- Which I think he misses us.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.465
- Yeah, he misses us.
- I think he misses up.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.599
- Yeah, something's up.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.700
He's been calling me
an awful lot.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.602
- You think he's homesick?
- Yeah.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.471
- I'd love to go to LA.
- Yeah!

04:32.539 --> 04:34.239
- Jersey Shore takes
on Hollywood.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.741
- Do I have to go?
I don't think I'm gonna go.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.243
- You have to go.
- He'll be too excited.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.045
- You will make plenty of time
to see the Keto Guido.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.047
- No, he'll [bleep] his pants
if he sees me.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.248
- Oh, man.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.117
<i>- So when Vinny first moved out</i>
<i> to LA,</i>

04:45.185 --> 04:47.619
he was very, very quiet
in group chat.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.955
Like, you could tell he was,
like, living his best life.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.457
And now all of a sudden
Vinny's crawled back

04:52.526 --> 04:54.793
to us in group chat,
and he's talking more.

04:54.862 --> 04:58.797
And I feel like he misses us,
and I feel like he's homesick.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.666
<i> Maybe we should go</i>
<i> and check on him.</i>

05:00.734 --> 05:03.135
- Guys, I gotta get to it.
Somebody gotta play the music.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.637
- Yes, yes. Yeah, we got to get
back to the kids.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.307
- Yep, yep.
- JWOWW, neighbor.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.542
- See you.
- Bye, guys.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.843
- Romeo is flipping out.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.412

05:23.891 --> 05:25.791
Angelina steps
out of the drama,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.626
and then she's like,
"You know what? I'm bored.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.631

05:49.083 --> 05:50.515

05:50.584 --> 05:52.818

- Exactly.
But what you say to them--

06:02.329 --> 06:03.595
- Now I'm getting pissed.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.930
Listen, I actually
didn't even explain anything.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.098
I was just making
a joke out of it.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.999

Don't talk to me, Vinny.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.843
Talk to my husband.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.277
I'm so used to this [bleep].

32:34.954 --> 32:37.688
- Oh, is Jenni making it?
- They actually have to

32:37.756 --> 32:39.756
redirect her flight
because of the weather.

32:39.825 --> 32:42.960
So instead of it being,
like, a 5-hour flight,

32:43.028 --> 32:45.729
it's actually gonna be, like,
a 7 1/2 hour flight.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.198

32:52.838 --> 32:55.105
- This trip is already off
to a rocky start.

32:55.174 --> 32:58.909
Now we're all just stranded
in the airport

32:58.978 --> 33:01.712
seeing if a new plane can come.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.580
So, like, hi, roomies.

33:03.649 --> 33:07.250
I'll see you next week
at this point.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.619
- And wait till she gets here

33:09.688 --> 33:11.688
and finds out
you leave tomorrow.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.157
- Well, good luck to you.
- It's all right.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.593
We're gonna make the best
out of this 24 hours.

33:20.399 --> 33:21.932
<i> So my worst fear,</i>

33:22.001 --> 33:25.602

33:27.439 --> 33:29.039

33:32.711 --> 33:34.745
So Vinny's going back
to the East Coast.

the prodigal son is returning.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.751

Can I stay with you?

33:40.819 --> 33:41.752
- No.
- Come on.

33:41.820 --> 33:42.953
- You can stay with me, Vin.

33:43.022 --> 33:45.389
- If I kick Chris out,
then you can stay.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.357

- Oh, my Lord.

- Oh, I don't know.

33:57.803 --> 34:01.805
- By making up lies about me,
Angelina crossed the line

34:01.874 --> 34:04.474

as [bleep].

34:04.543 --> 34:05.742

None of this is my problem.

All I'm saying is what I heard.

You know, Angelina,
her life is crazy messy.

34:48.921 --> 34:53.623
And she just wants to spread

34:56.962 --> 35:01.832
- So it's not right of you

35:01.900 --> 35:05.335
and make up such a crazy lie
about me.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.436
That's a real rumor.

- Both of you said it.
- We did say it.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.150
Word on the street.
Word on the street.

They were all meeting up

People say stuff about me

Like, we said it. That's it.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.668

what I wanted to happen.

35:46.778 --> 35:47.777

the messenger.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.647
- Say it to me. Say it to me.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.649

a wellness check on Vinny,

35:52.718 --> 35:57.053
not a let's
piss Vinny off trip. I can't.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.321

40:28.994 --> 40:31.428
<i> they got whatever they had</i>
<i> to say off their chest,</i>

40:31.496 --> 40:35.165
and tomorrow we could
start off fresh and new.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.700
- You know, Vinny,
he doesn't realize this,

40:37.769 --> 40:39.436
but he met his match
when he met me.

40:39.504 --> 40:41.271
- Listen, we're cool.
- [bleep] off.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.939
- We're cool. I don't like you.
But we're cool.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.308
- Yo, I will slap you up.
I'm gonna slap you.

40:45.377 --> 40:46.342
- You're gonna slap me up?

40:46.411 --> 40:50.947
- No, no.
No hitting, no hitting.

40:52.851 --> 40:53.917
- He was like, "You and your
[bleep] husband are snakes,

40:53.985 --> 40:55.385
and I'm gonna say
it your husband's face."

40:55.454 --> 40:56.386
I'm like, "You're gonna say
it's to Chris' face really?"

40:56.455 --> 40:57.720
<i> - He's a little [bleep] pussy.</i>

40:57.789 --> 40:59.255
<i> Wish I was there</i>
<i> to [bleep] smack him.</i>

40:59.324 --> 41:00.957
- You get mad at me
for other things,

41:01.026 --> 41:03.693
and your payback is coming on
the show and spreading a rumor.

41:03.762 --> 41:04.928
- It's not payback.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.062
- I just think you're being
really defensive,

41:06.131 --> 41:07.297
because you know
what you did was wrong.

41:07.365 --> 41:08.598
- Can we just eat
and not fight?

41:08.667 --> 41:09.732
- Shut the [bleep] up.
- That's my opinion.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.100
- Oh, [bleep].
- Can we have the check?
