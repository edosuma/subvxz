If this is what we think it is,
Jesse's dead and Marosi told the truth.

00:03.950 --> 00:05.270
He didn't get him.

00:05.430 --> 00:07.470
<i>Then how do we explain
his DNA turning up?</i>

00:07.630 --> 00:10.310
When I went to lure him in,
someone arrived.

00:10.470 --> 00:11.630
- Who?
- His father.

00:11.790 --> 00:14.870
Alan Wells, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Jesse Wells.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.510
<i>Lab spotted an anomaly.</i>

00:16.670 --> 00:18.150
Alan Wells is not Jesse's father.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.790
- Who was it?
- Frank Lipton.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.390
- <i>Where's Frank now?</i>
- <i>He moved away.</i>

00:21.550 --> 00:24.430
He moves to a remote house
and tries to make himself invisible.

00:24.590 --> 00:25.830
I love you.

00:26.590 --> 00:29.550
Is Jesse's DNA from that plaster?
What about blood donation?

00:29.710 --> 00:32.670
Do you happen to know the names
of the people that owned this place?

00:32.830 --> 00:34.110
You have to see this.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.230
- Mark!
- Frank!

00:45.230 --> 00:46.870
Hello, Mark.

00:47.030 --> 00:50.030
I suppose you being here
means you want answers.

00:51.230 --> 00:53.310

00:55.870 --> 00:57.950
<i>♪ The more you fart

00:58.270 --> 01:00.830
- Girls, that's enough.
- It's not swearing.

01:00.990 --> 01:03.790
Yes, it is. And even if it isn't,
it's still very irritating.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.110
<i>♪ Beans, beans
Are good for your heart ♪</i>

01:07.270 --> 01:09.910
- His name's Robert.
- His name's Karl!

01:10.070 --> 01:12.670
- It's mine!
- It's mine!

01:12.830 --> 01:13.910
Girls!

01:16.350 --> 01:18.990
I'm so sorry. I tried calling,
but you must have left.

01:19.150 --> 01:21.990
It's Mark. He's been up all night.
Temperature and vomiting.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.790
- I'm going to keep him home today.
- Oh boy, I'm sorry.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.590
I can still pick up
your girls after school.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.430
Alan should be home by then.

01:28.590 --> 01:30.310
- Are you sure that's OK?
- Yes, of course.

01:30.470 --> 01:32.750
Thanks, Julie.
Hope Mark's feeling better.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.230
- Have a good day, Frank.
- You too.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.510
Girls! Pack it in!

01:44.270 --> 01:45.230
Will you stop...

01:45.390 --> 01:48.190
Hannah,
will you stop irritating your sister?

<i>In a split second, everything changed.</i>

02:41.350 --> 02:43.510
<i>My wife and I
were never the same again.</i>

02:45.470 --> 02:47.710
<i>She blamed me for what happened.</i>

03:08.470 --> 03:11.750
<i>Your mother was kind.
She was there for me.</i>

03:12.710 --> 03:14.950
Our lives were destroyed
in that one moment.

03:16.270 --> 03:17.550
One decision...

03:18.790 --> 03:20.590
taken...

03:21.670 --> 03:23.670
In the blink of an eye...

03:23.830 --> 03:25.670
The consequences last forever.

03:28.030 --> 03:31.430
I don't need hope.
I need reality.

03:31.590 --> 03:36.270
That's what I deal in now.
Simple, basic reality.

03:37.070 --> 03:39.750
Oh, Frank! Frank!

04:11.270 --> 04:13.350
<i>I think she did it out of pity.</i>

04:13.510 --> 04:15.870
<i>But afterwards, she regretted it.</i>

04:17.029 --> 04:18.750
<i>She loved your father.</i>

04:20.149 --> 04:22.750
- Doesn't make sense.
- Frank, you're married.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.350
I'm married.

04:24.510 --> 04:25.870
She's left me.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.430
You're a beautiful man,

04:28.590 --> 04:30.830
but this was never
supposed to get serious.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.150
Jesse.

04:59.310 --> 05:01.430
<i>I asked her once if he was mine.</i>

05:02.070 --> 05:04.190
<i>She said, "No. I'm certain."</i>

05:07.030 --> 05:11.150
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

05:21.550 --> 05:24.390
<i>As Jesse got older,
I'd look at him.</i>

05:25.590 --> 05:26.950
<i>I could see it.</i>

05:28.430 --> 05:30.310
<i>I knew he was mine.</i>

05:34.870 --> 05:37.390
<i>Then that day in the park happened.</i>

05:37.550 --> 05:39.110
Just go!

06:16.030 --> 06:18.030
- Jesse!
- Slade!

06:45.350 --> 06:46.870
What are we gonna do?

06:47.470 --> 06:48.950
- Suppose Jesse tells?
- He won't.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.710
I'll make sure of it.
And neither will we.

06:52.550 --> 06:54.430
We tell no one. OK?

07:09.550 --> 07:11.670
Daniel! Come back here!

07:12.670 --> 07:14.830
Daniel! Daniel!

07:15.750 --> 07:17.590
Get back here now!

07:25.070 --> 07:26.550
Get in!

07:28.870 --> 07:30.030
Jesse?

07:45.310 --> 07:47.270
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

07:57.510 --> 08:00.390
You haven't seen a Golden Labrador

08:00.550 --> 08:02.230
around here, have you?

08:05.270 --> 08:06.710
His name's Blackie.

08:12.670 --> 08:13.870
Damn!

08:15.990 --> 08:19.270
I let him off his lead
and now I can't find him anywhere.

08:23.550 --> 08:26.030
Shall I tell you why I call him Blackie?

08:28.790 --> 08:31.950
He was from a litter of pups.

08:32.549 --> 08:35.590
And that means...
babies that mummy dog has.

08:36.190 --> 08:37.630
And they were all black.

08:38.270 --> 08:39.590
Except Blackie.

08:41.110 --> 08:42.429
He was golden.

08:44.710 --> 08:47.270
So when I took him home,
I thought it would be nice to pretend

08:47.430 --> 08:49.150
he was like his brothers and sisters.

08:49.310 --> 08:50.590
Huh?

08:53.350 --> 08:56.110
I have a picture
if you'd like to see it. Uh?

08:59.510 --> 09:01.750
- Where are you going?
- I have to go home.

09:01.910 --> 09:04.070
- No, no. You wait.
- I can't!

09:04.230 --> 09:07.310
Don't they teach manners at school?
Huh?

09:08.390 --> 09:10.790
Don't they teach you
to respect your elders?

09:10.950 --> 09:14.230
Leave him alone.
You. Get your hands off him.

09:16.630 --> 09:18.230
I know him. Who the hell are you?

09:19.350 --> 09:20.350
His father.

09:29.190 --> 09:32.310
You want to bring him up properly.
He's got foul mouth!

09:45.310 --> 09:47.190
Come on, Jesse. Let's go.

09:49.230 --> 09:51.390
That man lost his black dog.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.590
- Had he?
- That's what he said.

10:15.950 --> 10:17.830
Will you take me home after?

10:20.590 --> 10:24.430
Your mum phoned and said
it would be OK if you stayed the night.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.070
Thought it might be fun
if you spent some time with me.

10:27.230 --> 10:28.630
Boys together.

10:36.630 --> 10:38.070
And wait for me.

10:39.270 --> 10:40.550
Good boy.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.230
Uh-uh. Wait a minute.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.870
- This way.
- Where are we going?

10:47.550 --> 10:50.950
To the seaside.
Donkey rides and ice cream.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.230
I want my mummy!

10:57.790 --> 11:00.510
There are some things
I need to tell you, Jesse.

11:00.670 --> 11:01.790
Big things.

11:02.510 --> 11:04.870
About who you are and who I am.

11:06.070 --> 11:08.670
Are you a big enough boy
to listen carefully?

11:10.550 --> 11:11.510
Are you sure?

11:17.350 --> 11:19.830
<i>I'd been left
a house in the country.</i>

11:21.350 --> 11:22.950
<i>I moved Jesse there...</i>

11:23.790 --> 11:25.950
<i>where no one knew us.</i>

11:28.910 --> 11:31.870
This used to be my mother's house,
your grandma.

11:32.030 --> 11:34.110
- When did she die?
- A long time ago.

11:34.270 --> 11:37.550
Before you were born.
She was a lovely woman.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.390
She'd have loved you.

11:41.510 --> 11:43.070
Jesse, when you move to a new place,

11:43.230 --> 11:45.790
you get the chance
to start everything all over again.

11:46.510 --> 11:49.670
I've been thinking,
I don't want to be Frank any more.

11:49.830 --> 11:51.550
I want to be Ronald.

11:52.150 --> 11:53.630
Who do you want to be?

11:53.790 --> 11:56.030
If you weren't Jesse,
if you had the choice of any name

11:56.190 --> 11:57.630
in the whole wide world?

11:59.630 --> 12:02.630
<i>I'd come back
to Westbridge now and again.</i>

12:02.790 --> 12:05.190
<i>Show my face. Mow the lawn.</i>

12:06.630 --> 12:09.230
<i>After a couple of years, I sold it,</i>

12:09.390 --> 12:11.270
<i>left the area for good.</i>

12:15.430 --> 12:16.510
Karl?

12:17.950 --> 12:20.270
- Good luck today.
- It's all in here.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.590
What can they ask me about chemistry
that I can't answer?

12:24.270 --> 12:25.750
Call me afterwards.

12:27.510 --> 12:28.430
Love you.

12:30.190 --> 12:32.590
<i>Everything was fine for years,</i>

12:32.750 --> 12:35.310
<i>until one night...</i>

12:35.830 --> 12:38.230
- What do you do?
- Police forensics.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.670
Analyst.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.550
It's really cool.
It's like what you see on TV.

12:43.990 --> 12:47.270
- Same again?
- Yeah. And shots. Black Sambucas?

12:47.430 --> 12:49.150
I'm on call!

12:49.310 --> 12:51.790
- So have you ever seen a dead body?
- Oh, hundreds.

12:53.430 --> 12:54.950
Where the fuck
is this murder, anyway?

12:55.590 --> 12:58.350
Violet Hotel.
I should've wrote it down.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.830
- Give me a suit.
- No way, man.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.910
Come on, let me see the scene.

13:08.590 --> 13:11.870
Splatter zone.
It's like a Jackson Pollock in here!

13:24.430 --> 13:27.190
Forensics report, from Ken.
With the DNA results

13:27.350 --> 13:29.590
from the plaster found at the scene.

13:30.590 --> 13:32.590
Double-check
these forensic results.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.110
Why, what's the problem?

13:34.270 --> 13:36.070
We've had a DNA hit
from the MisPer database,

13:36.230 --> 13:38.070
from a kid that went missing in 1995.

13:38.230 --> 13:42.150
So stop impressing your boyfriend
and check them again. Thanks.

13:49.710 --> 13:50.590
Go!

13:59.230 --> 14:00.590
His father.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.510
Thanks, nurse. That's great.

14:15.590 --> 14:17.670
- Son!
- Dad.

14:36.470 --> 14:37.350
Dad...

14:41.190 --> 14:43.350
I've got something I need to ask you.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.790
Who the hell am I?

15:01.030 --> 15:02.350
It's Karl.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.390
My boy.

15:10.550 --> 15:14.390
I'm dying, Mark.
Look at me. All these tubes.

15:15.230 --> 15:18.230
If you want me to pay for it,
if you want me to suffer...

15:26.350 --> 15:30.670
The pain that you've caused...
You ruined their lives!

15:32.190 --> 15:33.990
You lost your daughters.
You know how it feels

15:34.150 --> 15:35.830
to have something snatched away.

15:35.990 --> 15:37.870
That made it easier.

15:39.310 --> 15:42.470
Life had shat all over me.
I had nothing to lose.

15:43.430 --> 15:47.390
Alan and Julie still had their child.
Their real child.

15:48.550 --> 15:49.390
You.

15:50.830 --> 15:55.150
But Karl, or Jesse,
he was as much mine as theirs.

15:55.670 --> 15:57.830
And look how they neglected him,

15:57.990 --> 16:00.910
letting him nearly get killed by that man.

16:04.550 --> 16:06.190
He saved my life.

16:08.470 --> 16:10.510
That boy saved my life.

16:13.710 --> 16:14.710
<i>Through to Karl.</i>

16:14.870 --> 16:16.950
<i>Depending on how fit you are,
leave a message.</i>

16:17.110 --> 16:18.830
Hi, Karl, it's Ally.

16:18.990 --> 16:22.150
Listen, can you just give me a call
as soon as you get this?

16:22.950 --> 16:24.550
Mark... It's voicemail.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.150
Why is no one answering?

16:26.310 --> 16:28.470
Hi, Mark, it's Pru.
Call me when you get this.

16:28.630 --> 16:30.390
It's urgent.

16:34.190 --> 16:37.070
- This is crazy. Karl?
- Jesse.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.830
Does he remember
anything from his past?

16:46.910 --> 16:50.030
- Frank.
- Sometimes he'd cry out in his sleep.

16:50.190 --> 16:51.270
"Mum."

16:52.750 --> 16:53.910
"Mark."

16:55.390 --> 16:57.430
I tried to remove all that.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.510
Er, and I was clever.
I knew just how to play it.

17:02.750 --> 17:07.550
Your mother would come round
the house, I'd let her in.

17:07.710 --> 17:11.550
We'd have tea.
I'd help out with the search party.

17:18.430 --> 17:19.750
How could you?

17:21.670 --> 17:23.750
Hate me if you want to.

17:24.470 --> 17:25.910
I deserve that.

17:27.109 --> 17:30.750
But when I saw Jesse
in the park that day,

17:30.910 --> 17:32.950
maybe I was blinded by my own grief,

17:34.150 --> 17:36.270
I felt like his father.

17:37.430 --> 17:39.790
I felt fiercely protective.

17:41.470 --> 17:45.710
It was like some higher power
had put me there that moment

17:46.230 --> 17:48.270
to protect my son.

17:53.950 --> 17:55.270
And now...

17:56.990 --> 17:59.150
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

18:00.350 --> 18:02.070
But I'll be gone soon.

18:05.230 --> 18:08.910
Karl hasn't come today.
He always comes.

18:10.630 --> 18:11.870
Wait with me.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.950
We can see him together.

18:19.110 --> 18:20.590
<i>We'll get him looked after,</i>

18:20.750 --> 18:23.630
someone that specialises
in Alzheimer's...

18:25.990 --> 18:28.510
knows how to look after him properly.

18:30.670 --> 18:32.630
And then we'll go on holiday.

18:34.110 --> 18:37.230
Like a proper length of time,
you, me and the kids.

18:37.830 --> 18:39.710
Take a month off of work.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.390
Throw my phone in the river.

18:51.470 --> 18:52.990
I'm sorry.

18:56.310 --> 18:58.510
Let's never forget this moment.

18:59.590 --> 19:03.430
Life will get busy again.
Normality will kick in.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.550
Let's never forget how this feels.

19:13.390 --> 19:14.830
What are you doing?

19:25.590 --> 19:28.910
- Danny?
- It's a Nigerian symbol.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.790
It means "Learn from your mistakes".

19:43.550 --> 19:46.110
No, he's not answering.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.750
We need him here.

19:48.910 --> 19:51.950
It's not like Danny to not answer.
The fire must have been really bad.

19:52.110 --> 19:54.750
I'm gonna go and see if he's OK.
You stay here.

19:56.190 --> 19:57.390
Wait for Karl.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.670
Look, Mark, I'm...

20:01.230 --> 20:03.110
I'm not a big believer
in fate or destiny

20:03.270 --> 20:06.470
or any of that bullshit, but...
But what?

20:08.590 --> 20:11.830
But, like it or not,
Frank saved Jesse's life that day.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.990
Jesse's alive because of Frank.

20:16.590 --> 20:21.790
Cause we let him go that day and,
if it wasn't for Frank, then who knows?

20:22.630 --> 20:24.270
You know what I mean?

20:25.030 --> 20:27.830
- He should have brought him home.
- I know. Of course. Of course.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.350
But just...

20:32.830 --> 20:34.270
I'll be back.

20:47.030 --> 20:49.150
- Ken, where's Karl?
- No idea. Why?

20:49.310 --> 20:51.910
- I need to speak to him.
- Concerning...?

20:52.070 --> 20:54.750
It's private. Where is he?
You two are like twins.

20:54.910 --> 20:57.190
- Did he leave the office?
- I really don't know.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.670
Well, if he comes back,
tell him I'm looking for him.

21:12.470 --> 21:15.350
Hey, um,
I think Ally might be onto something.

21:22.750 --> 21:23.990
Ally, you don't...

21:25.950 --> 21:28.470
Tell me the truth
or I will squeeze these so hard

21:28.630 --> 21:30.590
that you'll need surgery
to separate them.

21:31.510 --> 21:32.750
Leave!

21:33.950 --> 21:35.590
- What do you know?
- Nothing.

21:36.430 --> 21:38.470
What... do you know?

21:38.630 --> 21:41.630
He's not dangerous.
He's just... He's just confused.

21:42.470 --> 21:43.830
- Keep talking.
- Get off.

21:43.990 --> 21:46.110
Keep talking!

21:46.710 --> 21:49.150
He found something out
about who he really was.

21:50.190 --> 21:51.750
It sent him spinning.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.670
Look, I only helped him
because he's my friend.

21:55.430 --> 21:57.470
And because I screwed up.

22:01.710 --> 22:02.870
What did you do?

22:04.990 --> 22:07.310
It was me who brought him
to the murder scene.

22:09.030 --> 22:10.070
I was drunk.

22:11.470 --> 22:12.670
He drove me.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.750
If that came out, that's me done.

22:14.910 --> 22:18.070
It was my fault, Ally.
All this shit was my fault.

22:21.990 --> 22:23.350
<i>DNA came back.</i>

22:25.070 --> 22:26.510
<i>Blood on a plaster.</i>

22:26.670 --> 22:28.350
<i>Karl realised it was his.</i>

22:28.870 --> 22:31.910
<i>He's only an analyst,
so his DNA wasn't in the system.</i>

22:32.950 --> 22:36.630
<i>The system said it belonged
to a missing kid called Jesse Wells.</i>

22:37.390 --> 22:39.670
<i>He realised there was
only one explanation.</i>

22:40.550 --> 22:42.150
<i>He was Jesse Wells.</i>

22:46.590 --> 22:49.230
His dad admitted it. He was angry.

22:49.390 --> 22:53.030
His whole life was unravelling.
He was scared.

22:53.190 --> 22:55.670
He was punching walls, and screaming.

22:55.830 --> 22:57.830
That's how I found him, in bits.

22:59.790 --> 23:01.750
That's why I agreed to help him.

23:02.070 --> 23:05.110
- How?
- He wanted to hide his identity,

23:05.870 --> 23:08.590
to protect his real father
so he didn't die in a prison cell.

23:09.110 --> 23:11.230
Say what you want
about what the guy did, Karl loved him.

23:11.710 --> 23:14.470
- He was his dad.
- What did you do?

23:15.230 --> 23:18.230
I screwed with the murder scene.
At the Newman house.

23:21.550 --> 23:25.110
Planted more of his blood to...
to throw people off.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.030
- Jesus Christ, you idiot.
- I didn't want to!

23:28.190 --> 23:33.030
I told him, but if I came forward,
said what was going on...

23:33.190 --> 23:34.870
Ally, I would have lost everything.

23:36.350 --> 23:40.470
Ally, please, I am begging you,
please do not let this come out.

23:40.630 --> 23:43.470
It has to, Ken.
Planting evidence? Jesus!

23:43.630 --> 23:46.190
- I cannot lose my job!
- Is he still angry?

23:47.790 --> 23:49.950
- I don't know.
- And what's his state of mind?

23:50.910 --> 23:53.990
He buried it down,
pretended it wasn't happening.

23:54.150 --> 23:55.670
He was pretty torn up.

23:57.710 --> 24:00.190
Look, Ally, Ally, he really likes you.

24:00.350 --> 24:02.670
- Maybe you can talk to him.
- Where is he?

24:03.830 --> 24:04.910
I don't know.

24:08.230 --> 24:09.230
Hey, Pru, what's up?

24:09.390 --> 24:10.870
Slade, thank God. Where's Mark?

24:11.030 --> 24:13.430
It's a long answer right now.
I need to see him.

24:13.590 --> 24:16.870
- If this is about you and him...
- It's not that. It's about Jesse.

24:18.310 --> 24:20.910
- What about him?
- He's here. I think he's here.

24:21.070 --> 24:22.910
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- At the police station.

24:37.390 --> 24:38.430
Hey, Karl!

24:39.590 --> 24:42.470
Hey, gorgeous! You out all alone?

24:43.990 --> 24:45.510
It's cold out here.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.070
Er...
Have you got time for a drink?

24:50.230 --> 24:53.270
- We could get a coffee or something.
- I've already got one.

24:54.790 --> 24:58.070
Or a proper drink, just...
just have a chat?

24:59.070 --> 25:00.030
Is everything OK?

25:01.150 --> 25:04.430
- Yeah, everything's fine.
- It's just, you seem a bit...

25:04.590 --> 25:05.990
No, I'm fine.

25:13.790 --> 25:15.070
Shall we get that drink?

25:15.230 --> 25:17.270
Just go!

25:17.870 --> 25:18.710
Another time.

25:19.790 --> 25:21.390
Karl? Karl, wait.

25:22.870 --> 25:23.750
Jesse!

25:29.750 --> 25:30.670
Please, wait!

25:34.870 --> 25:35.870
Jesse!

25:39.910 --> 25:41.550
Slade, it's Jesse!

25:41.710 --> 25:43.190
<i>He's in the one-way system.</i>

25:43.350 --> 25:45.870
- Pru, where are you?
- <i>Colbon Street.</i>

25:48.350 --> 25:49.710
OK, I'm on my way!

26:01.630 --> 26:03.590
Come on, come on!

26:03.750 --> 26:06.190
Come on!

26:06.350 --> 26:08.230
- Where is he?
- There! In the silver car!

26:08.390 --> 26:09.870
Oh, shit!

26:14.030 --> 26:14.990
Jesse?

26:15.710 --> 26:16.710
Jesse?

26:17.510 --> 26:18.390
Oi!

27:20.590 --> 27:22.870
Hey, I got your message.

27:27.550 --> 27:28.790
He took him.

27:32.710 --> 27:35.150
He knew he was his and he took him.

27:36.670 --> 27:38.470
And Mum never knew anything, did she?

27:38.630 --> 27:40.350
She never suspected anything.

27:42.390 --> 27:45.630
And he was alive the whole time,
50 fucking miles away.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.670
50 fucking miles away, Danny,

27:47.830 --> 27:50.830
and he's been alive
the whole fucking time!

27:52.750 --> 27:55.630
He's been alive
the whole fucking time!

27:58.230 --> 28:01.470
He always comes, every day.

28:02.830 --> 28:04.270
I'm worried for him.

28:08.630 --> 28:11.750
Little Danny. Police officer now.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.950
- Frank...
- I know what I did was wrong

28:15.110 --> 28:19.390
and I'm ready to take
the consequences, such as they are.

28:22.430 --> 28:24.310
But I want you to know this...

28:26.270 --> 28:27.590
He didn't suffer.

28:28.110 --> 28:33.030
No. There was some confusion
at the start, some sadness.

28:33.190 --> 28:35.270
He missed his family,
of course he did.

28:35.430 --> 28:37.830
But after a while... things changed.

28:37.990 --> 28:42.070
He accepted me as his father.
And...

28:44.430 --> 28:46.870
He was happy, Mark.

28:48.070 --> 28:49.790
He wasn't mistreated.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.430
He... He was happy.

28:54.590 --> 28:55.790
He had a good life.

29:01.510 --> 29:03.750
It's a shame the rest of us didn't.

29:09.950 --> 29:11.590
So what are you gonna do?

29:24.910 --> 29:26.710
How long have they given you?

29:30.630 --> 29:31.830
Weeks.

29:51.430 --> 29:53.510
- Hey, Slade.
- <i>I lost him, Danny.</i>

29:53.670 --> 29:56.030
<i>But I'm at his car,
so I'll call you back.</i>

29:58.950 --> 30:00.190
I told you to smash the window!

30:00.750 --> 30:03.590
Yeah, Slade, I don't really feel
comfortable smashing a car window

30:03.750 --> 30:05.790
with a brick
in the middle of the street.

30:07.390 --> 30:08.630
But obviously you do.

30:20.710 --> 30:23.510
- It's Slade. Yeah?
- <i>Bit of a weird one.</i>

30:23.670 --> 30:26.430
We, um, trawled Karl's car,

30:26.590 --> 30:28.470
and we found something
in the glove box.

30:28.950 --> 30:31.470
- What is it?
- <i>It's a library card.</i>

30:31.630 --> 30:32.950
Library card?

30:33.470 --> 30:35.230
It's the library
where Mark's mum works.

30:36.670 --> 30:37.790
OK.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.030
<i>We also found something else.</i>

30:41.190 --> 30:42.510
Something else like what?

30:43.350 --> 30:45.550
Bullets. Lots of them.

30:51.630 --> 30:55.230
- I don't understand.
- We need more information.

30:55.390 --> 30:58.190
The person we've identified
is almost certainly the person

30:58.350 --> 31:00.350
whose DNA we found
at the crime scenes.

31:01.350 --> 31:02.750
- Jesse?
- Mum...

31:02.910 --> 31:05.150
He's got a different name now,
but there's a strong chance

31:05.310 --> 31:08.070
it's him.

31:08.230 --> 31:11.190
- Where is he?
- We're trying to find out.

31:11.350 --> 31:14.310
- He ran away.
- Oh, you've lost him?

31:15.030 --> 31:20.350
We're scared that, um,
he might do something stupid to himself

31:20.510 --> 31:23.270
or to somebody else. He's angry.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.390
Is that...

31:26.070 --> 31:27.190
He wouldn't hurt me.

31:28.670 --> 31:29.870
He wouldn't.

31:30.030 --> 31:34.670
We think he might have been here
at the library whilst you were here.

31:35.910 --> 31:37.790
We found this in his car.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.870
I'd know him. If I'd seen him,

31:45.030 --> 31:47.430
if he'd been here,
if my child was here, I'd know him.

31:49.110 --> 31:51.590
OK, er, look, um,

31:51.750 --> 31:55.430
can you have a look
and see what he might have taken out,

31:55.590 --> 31:57.910
what dates he may have been here?

31:58.070 --> 31:58.950
Mm...

32:02.230 --> 32:05.870
He was here yesterday.
Borrowed one book.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.550
<i>Gulliver's Travels.</i>

32:13.590 --> 32:15.030
It's Jesse!

32:17.990 --> 32:19.950
I think I know where he might be.

32:47.830 --> 32:48.670
Hello?

33:09.350 --> 33:10.550
Hello?

33:24.070 --> 33:26.470
Could you run those through
when you've a chance?

33:43.030 --> 33:44.390
Tough one, mate.

33:53.790 --> 33:54.630
Mark!

34:00.870 --> 34:03.310
There's only one exit here.

34:11.790 --> 34:14.389
All right, guys, spread out.
Keep in contact.

34:22.389 --> 34:23.670
Hi, I'm Pru.

34:23.830 --> 34:25.190
A friend of Danny's.

34:25.870 --> 34:28.550
- An admirer?
- It's just Karl.

34:29.949 --> 34:31.190
Jesse!

34:34.949 --> 34:35.830
Jesse!

34:47.989 --> 34:51.150
If we see him, be careful. OK?

34:54.070 --> 34:55.830
He's my brother, Slade.

35:57.470 --> 35:58.550
Jesse.

36:05.150 --> 36:07.150
I could never tie my shoelaces.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.310
You'd help me.

36:13.430 --> 36:15.910
You'd tie them for me.

36:17.310 --> 36:18.510
I remember that.

36:21.750 --> 36:24.150
You used to get on my nerves
with songs.

36:25.110 --> 36:26.470
Always singing.

36:27.070 --> 36:29.110
"The Grand Old Duke Of York".

36:29.790 --> 36:31.470
"Miss Molly Had A Dolly".

36:34.390 --> 36:36.430
You used to come into my bed
every morning.

36:36.790 --> 36:40.470
It didn't matter if it was
a weekday or weekend,

36:40.630 --> 36:43.990
you used to climb into my bed,
and, um,

36:45.230 --> 36:48.830
the first thing that you'd do is,
you'd ask a question.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.110
"Why do elephants have big ears?"

36:53.110 --> 36:55.070
"Why do volcanoes have lava?"

36:56.110 --> 36:57.470
They're good questions.

37:00.830 --> 37:02.590
You had an inquisitive mind.

37:07.830 --> 37:09.590
This is where we used to play.

37:10.390 --> 37:12.270
Yeah. Yeah, this was our spot.

37:13.150 --> 37:14.310
Ours.

37:30.710 --> 37:31.790
Except...

37:33.230 --> 37:35.310
we didn't know about the lies
we'd been told.

37:37.950 --> 37:39.630
Didn't know the truth, did we?

37:40.510 --> 37:41.550
No.

37:44.390 --> 37:47.870
- She lied to us.
- Mum made a mistake, Karl.

37:50.030 --> 37:54.590
And she... tried her best
to make it good again.

37:59.270 --> 38:00.630
Mum loved you.

38:03.550 --> 38:06.430
- It's blown my world apart.
- I know.

38:07.390 --> 38:09.110
Nothing's what I thought it was.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.270
Jess...

38:13.430 --> 38:14.630
Karl.

38:18.070 --> 38:20.870
Let's deal with it. Yeah?

38:22.470 --> 38:24.870
Let's deal with it
and let's make it right again.

38:26.110 --> 38:26.950
Can we?

38:33.630 --> 38:35.230
You're my brother.

38:35.790 --> 38:37.750
And Mum is still your mum.

38:37.910 --> 38:39.150
And Dad...

38:40.110 --> 38:42.750
You've got no idea
how much he loves you.

38:43.470 --> 38:44.750
His or not...

38:47.270 --> 38:49.590
- We just want you home.
- You know?

38:52.470 --> 38:54.230
And all of us that were there
that day: Danny,

38:54.990 --> 38:56.550
Pru, Slade...

38:56.710 --> 38:59.390
our lives, they changed, you know,

38:59.550 --> 39:01.870
and we weren't the same people.

39:03.350 --> 39:04.790
But finding you...

39:06.990 --> 39:09.150
knowing you're still alive...

39:11.070 --> 39:12.910
I remember at school...

39:15.070 --> 39:17.590
I used to tell people
I had a big brother.

39:19.590 --> 39:22.150
And they'd say, "No, you haven't."

39:22.310 --> 39:24.590
And I'd say, "I have."

39:26.910 --> 39:29.630
"He's tough, he's big,

39:29.790 --> 39:32.950
and if you don't watch out,
he'll come and get you."

39:41.470 --> 39:43.230
We just want you back.

39:47.110 --> 39:50.790
I've been waiting to take
my brother home for 20 years.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.870
It's time to go home.

40:32.310 --> 40:34.230
Mum.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.470
Mum.

40:41.910 --> 40:42.990
Hello, son.

40:50.310 --> 40:51.670
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

40:51.830 --> 40:53.470
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:16.910 --> 41:18.270
I love you too.

41:20.790 --> 41:23.950
- It's a mess, though, isn't it?
- Yeah. We'll find a way.

41:25.910 --> 41:27.270
We'll find a way.

41:53.710 --> 41:54.870
Doesn't matter.
