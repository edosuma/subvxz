-Hey, hey.

11:28.650 --> 11:30.570
Hey, Maurice, wake up!

11:30.570 --> 11:33.760
You know what I was just
thinking in my brain?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.530
-Do tell.

11:37.570 --> 11:42.420
-That time the penguins
wanted we to do a good deed.

11:42.420 --> 11:43.770
What were they thinking?

11:48.950 --> 11:50.690
It's so funny!

11:50.690 --> 11:52.310
Join with me!

11:52.310 --> 11:54.890
It's funny, Mauri-- come
on, it's a little funny.

11:54.890 --> 11:58.320
[GRUNT]

12:08.610 --> 12:12.600
MORT: I want Cheezy Bits!

12:19.750 --> 12:20.450
-Mort?

12:20.450 --> 12:21.300
What are you doing?

12:21.300 --> 12:25.450
-I want Cheezy Bits!

12:25.450 --> 12:26.990
-That's not how
you get snacks out.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.650
First we need to
find some money.

12:28.650 --> 12:30.610
You'd be surprised
how much loose change

12:30.610 --> 12:31.660
ends up under of these things.

12:31.660 --> 12:35.530
Hey, this oughta do the trick.

12:35.530 --> 12:36.230
MORT: Yay!

12:42.050 --> 12:43.630
I got Cheezy Bits!

12:43.630 --> 12:44.330
Yay.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.770
-I can't get the door open.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.490
OK, not getting out that way.

12:51.490 --> 12:54.690
Still, there must be some
way out of this stuffy box.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.430
One, two, three!

12:59.630 --> 13:02.910
--[SPITS] I do not
like Cheezy Bits.

13:02.910 --> 13:05.600
-Marvellous, Mort.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.100
-Who put a pretty pink
floral arrangement in there?

13:09.100 --> 13:11.670
Private, I'm looking at you.

13:11.670 --> 13:13.850
Or I would be, if you were here.

13:13.850 --> 13:14.860
Where's young Private?

13:14.860 --> 13:15.560
-Hmm.

13:15.560 --> 13:20.810
0800 hours, he should be
watching the Lunacorns.

13:20.810 --> 13:22.180
-Weird.

13:22.180 --> 13:25.180
-Man, something
smells fishy here.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.190
I mean beyond the ever-present
fishy smell of our home.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.350
[SCREAMING]

13:30.350 --> 13:32.560
-This mango is rotten!

13:32.560 --> 13:34.230
Oh, I'm so angry.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.070
I need to be kicking something.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.740
Mort, assume the position.

13:41.740 --> 13:43.440
Hey, where is he?

13:43.440 --> 13:45.220
-Not where he usually is.

13:45.220 --> 13:48.030
-The lemurs are missing
key personnel, too?

13:48.030 --> 13:50.040
-Mmm, [GIBBERISH].

13:50.040 --> 13:52.230
-We'll canvass the zoo
in a counter-clockwise

13:52.230 --> 13:54.020
concentric circle pattern.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.040
Now, the advantages
of this search--

13:56.040 --> 13:56.990
-Boring!

13:56.990 --> 13:59.320
Let's move out.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.290
Ringtail, I said move out.

14:01.290 --> 14:02.080
-Shh!

14:02.080 --> 14:05.270
Look, Prince Sharesalot
forgot Princess

14:05.270 --> 14:07.920
Selfrespectra's birthday!

14:07.920 --> 14:09.830
And she is devastated,
look at her!

14:09.830 --> 14:12.890
-You want devastation, ringtail,
I'll give you devastation.

14:12.890 --> 14:16.330
-Uh, Skipper, maybe it's best
we leave him watching the tube.

14:16.330 --> 14:18.780
I mean, the king's
helping usually

14:18.780 --> 14:20.850
isn't that helpful,
know what I mean?

14:29.630 --> 14:30.620
-There.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.010
-Yay, you did it!

14:33.010 --> 14:34.240
What did you do?

14:34.240 --> 14:37.670
-Because of the narrow and
woefully confining space,

14:37.670 --> 14:39.820
I can't get enough force
to knock the glass out.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.290
But this tightly coiled
spring just might.

14:42.290 --> 14:44.750
So when I untie the
licorice vines, it'll--

14:44.750 --> 14:46.490
[CREAKING]

14:48.300 --> 14:49.490
-Oopsie.

14:49.490 --> 14:51.380
I eated the vine.

14:51.380 --> 14:52.210
-So I noticed.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.180
-Rico, a fellow
soldier's MIA, and you

15:01.180 --> 15:02.940
want to stop for munchies?

15:02.940 --> 15:04.280
-Um, nuh uh?

15:04.280 --> 15:04.980
-Right.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.140
Now, stay frosty, man.

15:06.140 --> 15:09.340
Private and Sad Eyes
could be anywhere.

PRINCESS SELFRESPECTRA
(ON TV): My birthday wish

15:10.940 --> 15:13.810
is, I wish I'd never
had a birthday!

15:13.810 --> 15:14.890
-[GASP] No!

15:14.890 --> 15:16.090
NARRATOR (ON TV):
The Lunacorns will

15:16.090 --> 15:18.490
return after these
important messages.

15:18.490 --> 15:20.010
-Aww, ma-- oh.

15:20.010 --> 15:21.870
These messages are important?

15:21.870 --> 15:23.860
Then I will pay extra attention.

15:23.860 --> 15:25.810
PROFESSOR (ON TV):
Hey, hey, kids!

15:25.810 --> 15:28.990
Professor Quimby
Q. Cutiepie here.

15:28.990 --> 15:32.170
I'm coming to your
area to reveal my brand

15:32.170 --> 15:35.370
new collection of
cutie pie cuties.

15:35.370 --> 15:38.880
-Ahh That is Mort,
and the silly penguin!

15:38.880 --> 15:40.770
They are petrified with fear!

15:40.770 --> 15:43.160
-Better hurry, because
these limited edition

15:43.160 --> 15:45.800
animals won't last long.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.500
-No!

15:46.500 --> 15:47.260
-Yes!

15:47.260 --> 15:51.310
Soon they'll be locked away in
the professor's vault, forever!

professor this afternoon

15:53.010 --> 15:54.440

-8686 Battery Place.

8686 Battery Place.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.650
-Private, oh, Private.

16:00.650 --> 16:02.720
We've got winkies.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.490
-Forget it.

16:03.490 --> 16:06.340
This private bait just
isn't cutting the mustard.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.440
-Uh, so can I toss
these away then?

16:08.440 --> 16:09.730
They're kinda creepin' me out.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.520
KING JULIEN: 8686 Battery Place.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.090
8686 Battery Place!

16:14.090 --> 16:15.060
I know where they are!

16:15.060 --> 16:17.720
They've been taken
by an evil professor,

16:17.720 --> 16:20.340
and he said they
won't last long!

16:20.340 --> 16:22.690
He's gonna lock him
in the vault, forever!

16:22.690 --> 16:24.580
-And you know all this, how?

16:24.580 --> 16:26.590
You were watching the
Lunacorns when we left.

16:26.590 --> 16:29.810
-8686 Batt-- Yes, and
it was very good, too.

16:29.810 --> 16:31.270
But then they
interrupted the show

16:31.270 --> 16:32.630
with a very important message!

16:32.630 --> 16:33.330
-Breaking news?

16:33.330 --> 16:34.460
-Yes, very broken!

16:34.460 --> 16:38.210
Fortunately, the TV box
said where to find this man,

16:38.210 --> 16:41.910
and it is 8686 Battery Place!

16:41.910 --> 16:45.100
-That sicko's got a whole
place for battering?

16:45.100 --> 16:49.340
-And he calls
himself an academic.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.190
-I've gotta get outta here.

16:51.190 --> 16:52.390
Get a grip, Private.

16:52.390 --> 16:53.590
Going crackers won't
solve anything.

16:56.470 --> 16:57.170
OK, think.

16:57.170 --> 16:59.480
What would Skipper
do in this situation?

16:59.480 --> 17:00.670
He'd ask for options.

17:00.670 --> 17:02.550
So what would Kowalski say?

17:02.550 --> 17:05.470
Probably something I
wouldn't understand anyway.

17:05.470 --> 17:08.170
Course, Rico'd just
want to blow it up.

17:08.170 --> 17:10.440
Yes, that's it!

17:10.440 --> 17:12.470
It starts with these
winter fresh mints.

17:12.470 --> 17:14.670
You see, they spark
when you chew them.

17:14.670 --> 17:17.350
The sparks will ignite
these flaming hots, which

17:17.350 --> 17:19.420
will act like a fuse
and burn to these very

17:19.420 --> 17:20.730
combustible sugary sticks.

17:20.730 --> 17:22.300
And hopefully they will
blow with enough bang

17:22.300 --> 17:23.980
to knock this window
out, while we're safely

17:23.980 --> 17:26.130
hidden behind a
packet of crisps.

17:26.130 --> 17:29.400
Pretty smashing plan, eh, Mort?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.100
No!

17:36.710 --> 17:37.740
MORT: My mouth got all sparkly!

17:40.550 --> 17:41.250
-Ugh.

17:41.250 --> 17:45.650
It smells like seafood up t--

you looking at, buddy?

17:52.490 --> 17:53.440
-Hi, Face.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.670
My name is Mort.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.090
What's yours?

17:56.090 --> 17:59.520
[SLURP] That's a funny name.

17:59.520 --> 18:03.410
Oh, that's not you,
is it, you silly face?

18:03.410 --> 18:06.080
What are you licking?

18:06.080 --> 18:08.320
-Well, Mort, I've fashioned
these hard candies

18:08.320 --> 18:10.470
into a wrench, and
now I'm going to use

18:10.470 --> 18:12.550
it to open the back of this
machine so we can escape.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.410
-Oh, boy!

18:13.410 --> 18:14.210
Can I help?

18:14.210 --> 18:15.290
Can I?

18:15.290 --> 18:17.000
No, Mort, you cannot.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.550
In fact, don't touch
anything at all.

18:19.550 --> 18:21.470
Every time you touch
something, it goes all wrong,

18:21.470 --> 18:23.420
and I wind up trapped in
here for another hour,

18:23.420 --> 18:26.240
and-- is it me, or is the
oxygen getting thin in here?

18:26.240 --> 18:28.940
-That sounded just
like the bossy penguin.

18:28.940 --> 18:32.540
Oh, now do the throw-uppy one!

18:32.540 --> 18:35.430
No, that's still the bossy one.

18:35.430 --> 18:37.010
COMPUTER: Keep up the good work.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.630
According to my
calculations, this

18:49.630 --> 18:52.050
is the evil professor's
back entrance.

18:52.050 --> 18:54.610
I believe we can enter through
that ventilation grate.

18:54.610 --> 18:56.560

excited for this event.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.730
We'll get you out in front of
the kids in just a few moments.

-OK, Quimby, it's showtime!

19:04.120 --> 19:05.370
-OK, Rico, it's showtime.

19:12.980 --> 19:14.990
-What was that?

19:14.990 --> 19:16.330
-Where is lemur?

19:16.330 --> 19:18.920
Where is penguin?

19:18.920 --> 19:21.840
-What is this?

[SCREAMS]

19:22.950 --> 19:26.600

further ado, meet

Professor Quimby Q
Cutiepie and his cuties!

19:36.930 --> 19:39.870
-Uh, Kowalski, shouldn't
a mad scientist's lair

19:39.870 --> 19:43.460
have more instruments of death,
and less adorable children?

19:43.460 --> 19:44.360
-One would think.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.700
-Uh, guys.

19:45.700 --> 19:46.870
What's with all the plush?

19:46.870 --> 19:48.070
-I don't know, beats me.

19:48.070 --> 19:51.170
-Boys, I think we've been
the opposite of right.

19:51.170 --> 19:51.870
-Mmm.

19:51.870 --> 19:54.340
And I wonder how
that could happen?

19:54.340 --> 19:56.110
-Where is my Mort?

19:56.110 --> 20:00.050
Tell me, or I shall insult
you with a withering put-down!

20:00.050 --> 20:02.950
Probably something about
your sense of fashion.

20:02.950 --> 20:04.920
I don't know, it'll come to me.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.040
Why are we fleeing?

20:08.800 --> 20:09.650
-OK, Mort.

20:09.650 --> 20:11.560
We have enough food to
last us several days.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.430
And surely Skipper will
find us by then, right?

20:14.430 --> 20:18.120
-Mmm, my finger smells funny.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.510
You wanna smell it?

20:19.510 --> 20:20.210
-No.

20:20.210 --> 20:22.320
I'm going to conserve
energy and sleep.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.290
You should do the same.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.270
-Nighty night!

[LOUD BURP]

20:30.250 --> 20:30.950
-Nah?

20:30.950 --> 20:31.830
What-- what was that?

20:31.830 --> 20:33.030
-Ooh.

20:33.030 --> 20:36.710
My tummy no feel so good.

20:36.710 --> 20:38.590
-Mort, What happened?

20:38.590 --> 20:39.290
Where's the food?

20:39.290 --> 20:40.590
-Eh, I got hungry.

20:40.590 --> 20:42.040
-So you ate everything?

20:42.040 --> 20:43.520
Well, even the Cheezy Bits?

20:43.520 --> 20:45.520
-They're not so bad
after the fifth bag.

20:50.110 --> 20:52.500
-Do you realise what
you've done, Mort?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.930
We needed that food.

20:53.930 --> 20:55.870
You've doomed us both!

20:55.870 --> 20:56.650
-Doomed?

20:56.650 --> 20:57.350
-Yes!

20:57.350 --> 21:02.490
Doomed, doomed, doomed, because
you're dumb, dumb, dumb!

21:02.490 --> 21:03.950
Oh, don't you dare cry.

21:03.950 --> 21:05.820
Because the only thing worse
than being trapped with you

21:05.820 --> 21:07.710
for the rest of my
life is being trapped

21:07.710 --> 21:10.260
for the rest of my
life, with you crying!

21:12.820 --> 21:15.210
-The vending machine
is empty again?

21:15.210 --> 21:16.250
Bah, gotta restock.

21:19.250 --> 21:19.950
-Huh?

21:23.540 --> 21:24.240
Shh.

21:30.490 --> 21:34.300
Oh, I can breathe again!

21:34.300 --> 21:35.320
Mort, you did it!

21:35.320 --> 21:38.560
Eating all that food
actually saved our lives.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.010
I'm sorry I got cross with you.

21:40.010 --> 21:43.170
-And I'm sorry I
eated all the food.

21:43.170 --> 21:44.160
-But Mort, don't you see?

21:44.160 --> 21:46.660
It was a good thing
that you ate the food!

21:46.660 --> 21:49.190
-But you told me not to.

21:49.190 --> 21:50.430
No, I know I did.

21:50.430 --> 21:53.620
