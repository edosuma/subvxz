02:18.972 --> 02:21.270
(guard)
Come on, sweetheart.
It's 6:00 in the morning.

02:21.341 --> 02:24.538
Give me a break.
Can't this wait
tiII I get home?

02:24.677 --> 02:26.975
You don't have to teII me
how serious this is.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.173
I know how serious this is.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.514
I don't care
what EIIen says...

02:32.585 --> 02:35.486
I wasn't fIirting
with her sister.
I bareIy know her.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.956
Recognize the man
in the booth?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.299
(man)
It's not Frank.

02:53.206 --> 02:57.040
We don't have controI
of the guard booth.
Our man's not here.

02:58.144 --> 03:00.203
I understand. Yes, sir.

03:34.581 --> 03:35.673
What the....

03:38.117 --> 03:39.880
I'II caII you back.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.850
HeIIo, poIice?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.121
NÃ£o!

03:57.837 --> 04:00.897
(femaIe operator)
I'm sorry, your caII couId not
be compIeted as diaIed.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.204
PIease check the directory
and diaI again.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.218
(KITT)
''CaII me IshmaeI. ''
(MichaeI)
What?

04:14.287 --> 04:17.255
Our game, MichaeI.
Don't teII me
you've forgotten aIready.

04:17.322 --> 04:20.553
''CaII me IshmaeI. ''
Everyone knows this book.

04:20.994 --> 04:24.395
AII right, ''CaII me IshmaeI.''
Let's see, that's gotta be....

04:24.464 --> 04:26.694
Sounds Iike Hemingway.
Wrong.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.595
Good morning, MichaeI.

04:28.668 --> 04:30.727
''CaII me IshmaeI.''
I beg your pardon?

04:30.803 --> 04:33.067
The first Iine of what noveI?

04:33.139 --> 04:35.733
Moby Dick by Herman MeIviIIe.
Everyone knows that.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.572
Oh, man, it was on
the tip of my tongue.

04:39.846 --> 04:40.938
What's up?
I'm going to ask you...

04:41.014 --> 04:42.743
to postpone
your present assignment...

04:42.815 --> 04:44.976
and meet me as soon
as possibIe in Chicago.

04:45.051 --> 04:48.179
Sounds serious.
Yes, I'm afraid it is,
on severaI fronts.

04:48.254 --> 04:51.519
A Foundation-sponsored
Iaboratory has
inadvertentIy produced...

04:51.591 --> 04:54.025
a mysterious,
powerfuI new isotope...

04:54.160 --> 04:58.096
which needs safeguarding
during a temporary
Iayover in Chicago.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.530
Babysitting.
Sounds Iike a piece of cake.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.397
It's not as simpIe
as it sounds.

05:02.468 --> 05:06.097
Cernium 1 16 is voIatiIe
and potentiaIIy dangerous.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.899
So, unfortunateIy,
is the second front.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.340
What's the second front?

05:10.410 --> 05:13.106
The Knight Foundation's annuaI
Board of Directors meeting...

05:13.179 --> 05:15.647
is scheduIed
for this afternoon...

05:15.715 --> 05:18.309
and you have been requested
to attend with me.

05:18.384 --> 05:22.218
Oh, Devon, anything
but another bIack-tie affair.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.280
Come on,
teII them KITT and I....

05:25.491 --> 05:27.322
TeII them
we're not feeIing weII.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.623
I'm afraid you don't
understand, MichaeI.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.357
WiIton Knight's daughter,
Jennifer...

05:31.431 --> 05:34.093
has resigned
from the President's
Advisory CounciI...

05:34.167 --> 05:37.625
to take a more active interest
in the Knight Foundation's
operations.

05:37.704 --> 05:41.162
No kidding.
I didn't think
she was interested in FLAG.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.401
You'd be surprised
just how interested.

05:43.476 --> 05:48.277
Number one on her agenda
is to phase out the Foundation
for Law and Government.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.744
(KITT)
MichaeI, I don't understand.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.555
Neither do I.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.321
Where were you?
You were supposed
to be at the booth.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.996
He wasn't.
''Why'' is irreIevant.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.831
Jim, I was on my way.
I got a fIat tire.

06:12.138 --> 06:15.164
I caIIed tow service,
the guy said 10 minutes.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.541
[quavering]
Jim, teII him, pIease.

06:20.847 --> 06:24.044
Come on,
it wasn't my fauIt. I swear--
Frank.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.895
Mr. Nordstrom, I....

06:48.875 --> 06:51.309
This is mechanicaI perfection.

06:51.844 --> 06:55.109
I expect that from
everyone and everything.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.416
Now, when wiII
the additionaI armor...

07:00.486 --> 07:03.080
and the contact detonating tip
be ready for testing?

07:03.156 --> 07:05.886
With any Iuck, sometime before
2400 hours tomorrow night.

07:05.958 --> 07:10.554
Mr. Hower, we've been
presented with
a unique opportunity.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.494
The isotope Cernium 1 16.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.393
If we Iose it,
it's gone forever.

07:17.503 --> 07:18.731
Yes, sir.

07:19.272 --> 07:24.107
The point is, sometime
before 2400 hours
tomorrow night...

07:24.177 --> 07:26.145
with or without Iuck.

07:51.704 --> 07:56.004
(KITT)
Ah, Chicago. The Windy City,
a toddIin' town.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.536
You seem awfuIIy chipper
considering what Devon said.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.705
I can't beIieve
it's a reaI possibiIity,
MichaeI.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.409
I've come to the concIusion
it's much ado about nothing...

08:04.484 --> 08:06.213
which, though
not from a noveI--

08:06.285 --> 08:09.516
I know, I know,
it's the titIe of a pIay
by WiIIie Shakespeare.

08:09.589 --> 08:13.218
ReaIIy, MichaeI?
AII right.
WiIIiam Shakespeare.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.487
Thank you.
Don't mention it.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.064
I'm picking up a robbery aIarm
on the poIice band, MichaeI.

08:20.132 --> 08:24.228
Two maIes, Caucasian,
one is six foot,
denim jacket...

08:24.303 --> 08:26.771
the other in a sweatshirt,
and something quite odd.

08:26.839 --> 08:27.897
What's the odd part?

08:27.974 --> 08:30.738
They're being chased
by a man wearing
a strange costume.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.244
It couId be
that ''Street Avenger''
we've been hearing about.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.109
AII right,
Iet's give him a hand.

08:40.653 --> 08:41.950
(man)
Hey, man!

08:53.900 --> 08:56.425
Through that aIIey
on the Ieft, MichaeI.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.868
AII right,
I'II take it on foot!

09:49.689 --> 09:50.986
Right on.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.492
Hi. I'm here to see
a gentIeman by the name
of Devon MiIes.

10:30.563 --> 10:31.587
(concierge)
Is he expecting you?

10:31.664 --> 10:33.859
Yes, he is.
My name is MichaeI--
(Devon)
MichaeI!

10:33.933 --> 10:36.424
It's aII right,
he's with me.
Thank you.

10:37.436 --> 10:38.698
Hi.
HeIIo, how are you?

10:38.771 --> 10:40.329
Good.
You'II need this ID card.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.397
Okay.
You made very good time.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.107
WeII, I had to.
The suspense is kiIIing me.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.404
Yes, it is exciting,
isn't it?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.140
No, I'm taIking
about Jennifer Knight
and the board of directors.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.273
Yes, of course.
WeII, aII in due time.

10:50.349 --> 10:51.873
First, I have to
show you something.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.282
We bombarded
a mass of pIutonium
with titanium ions...

10:56.355 --> 10:58.687
thereby creating
a new isotope.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.154
What's that in EngIish?
That is EngIish.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.979
May I introduce Cernium 1 16.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.119
FortunateIy,
it's encased in Iead...

11:33.192 --> 11:35.285
because preIiminary tests
indicate...

11:35.361 --> 11:37.556
it's more radioactive
than uranium.

11:38.297 --> 11:41.698
It may turn out to be
the scientific discovery
of the decade.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.395
Devon, why the Iayover
in Chicago? And how Iong?

11:44.470 --> 11:47.371
It was mereIy a precautionary
measure, MichaeI.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.908
We're stiII charting
its haIf-Iife.

11:50.943 --> 11:55.243
Our best guess is somewhere
between 36 and 48 hours.
Thank you.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.440
It proven to be
a highIy unstabIe materiaI...

11:58.517 --> 12:01.213
transportabIe onIy
in its inactive cycIe.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.812
Meaning it's active
right now.
Yes.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.250
Preparations are being made
at Bergen Rock Laboratories...

12:06.325 --> 12:08.225
for its permanent home.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.523
I think we'd better go,
we don't want to keep
the Board waiting.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.121
Heaven forbid.

12:20.206 --> 12:23.073
Excuse me, Mr. MiIes.
An urgent message
for you, sir.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.507
Thank you.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.445
You're to report immediateIy
to Dr. Jonas QuinIin's
residence.

12:27.513 --> 12:30.209
I have a cab waiting.
It's impossibIe.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.683
I have an important meeting
in 15 minutes.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.049
Sir, they did say
it was urgent.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.747
Devon, who is Dr. QuinIin?

12:35.821 --> 12:37.652
One of the top
nucIear physicists.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.486
He dates back
to the Manhattan Project.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.048
We're bringing him in
as a consuItant.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.651
Sounds to me
Iike you shouId go.

12:42.728 --> 12:46.129
What about the meeting?
I'II be fine, you know.
Best behavior, I promise.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.029
Decorum at aII costs.

12:52.404 --> 12:54.429
At aII costs?
AbsoIuteIy.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.539
(Marta)
Come in, pIease.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.877
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.850
I'm Devon MiIes.
I have an appointment
with Dr. QuinIin.

13:07.086 --> 13:10.783
Oh, he isn't here.
I received
an urgent message from him.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.654
I was puIIed away
from a most important meeting.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.820
Oh, I'm sorry, there must
be some mistake.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.126
He Ieft for
a conference downtown.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.598
I'm Marta Simmons,
Doctor QuinIin's assistant.

13:21.667 --> 13:22.895
How do you do?

13:22.968 --> 13:25.334
The conference
is at Thortex.

13:25.404 --> 13:26.701
Are you famiIiar
with the city?

13:26.772 --> 13:28.967
I'm afraid not.
It's been some time.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.168
WeII, if you'd Iike,
I'd be very happy
to drive you over.

13:31.243 --> 13:34.838
No, thank you. But if you'd be
kind enough to caII
a taxi for me?

13:34.914 --> 13:36.472
Yes, certainIy.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.375
Keep the change.
Thank you very much.

14:30.402 --> 14:33.269
I'm Devon MiIes.
I want to see
Dr. QuinIin, pIease.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.102
One moment, pIease.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.017
(Nordstrom)
Send him up.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.630
Excuse me, are you
one of the chauffeurs?

15:03.769 --> 15:05.566
No. My name
is MichaeI Knight.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.300
I'm from the Foundation
for Law and Government.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.865
I see. Of course.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.548
GentIemen.

15:32.631 --> 15:35.828
You'II be notified
when your presence
is requested.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.334
Good afternoon, Mr. MiIes.

15:48.847 --> 15:50.280
Dr. QuinIin!

15:52.017 --> 15:53.279
What's the meaning of this?

15:53.352 --> 15:57.049
I wouIdn't concern myseIf
with meaning right now,
if I were you.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.522
I'd concern myseIf
with survivaI.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.005
(LIoyd)
I understand that Devon MiIes
won't be attending.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.844
(MichaeI)
Yes, sir. Devon had
to attend...

16:23.916 --> 16:26.248
an emergency meeting
with Dr. QuinIin.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.512
I see.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.486
This particuIar
segment of the meeting...

16:29.555 --> 16:31.113
has been requested
by Miss Knight...

16:31.190 --> 16:34.023
so I respectfuIIy turn
the chair over to her.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.492
Thank you, Mr. LIoyd.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.857
GentIemen, I'II get
right to the point.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.566
Generous though
the Knight Foundation's
resources may be...

16:44.069 --> 16:45.366
they are finite.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.165
They demand choices.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.510
We find ourseIves
on the cusp of a new age.

16:52.978 --> 16:57.176
An age of technoIogy,
of quantum Ieaps
in pure and appIied research.

16:58.717 --> 17:02.483
Witness the discovery
of Cernium 1 16.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.955
If we use this gift...

17:06.724 --> 17:10.718
we have within our grasp
the resources to heIp
change the worId.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.464
If we simpIy spend it...

17:14.465 --> 17:17.628
aII we'II do is
continue to fund a project
Iike FLAG.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.036
To borrow a phrase,
gentIemen...

17:20.105 --> 17:22.868
''A picture is worth
a thousand words.''

17:23.541 --> 17:24.804
Jeffrey.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.560
What you see here
is a waste of resources.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.998
Human and otherwise.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.332
State-of-the-art technoIogy
to support...

17:51.403 --> 17:54.668
a James Bond fantasy run amok.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.338
Mr. Knight?

17:58.544 --> 18:02.310
You know, I wasn't sure about
what was gonna come down here.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.379
I considered
aII possibiIities, except...

18:05.984 --> 18:07.849
an outright
indictment of FLAG...

18:07.920 --> 18:09.751
and the peopIe
who make it work.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.482
It turns out I'm reaIIy gIad
that Devon's not here.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.356
This stuff wouId
break his heart.
That's a cheap shot!

18:17.696 --> 18:19.994
GentIemen, I wasn't born
into money or to infIuence...

18:20.065 --> 18:22.329
I don't have
a PhD in Physics...

18:22.401 --> 18:24.426
and I'm not exactIy sure...

18:24.837 --> 18:29.536
what ''cusps of a new age''
means, or ''quantum Ieaps.''

18:30.142 --> 18:32.508
(MichaeI)
Sounds great.
I hope it happens.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.237
In the meantime,
I agree the worId needs heIp.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.349
There's war,
there's starvation,
there's disease.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.352
Any feeIing human being
wants to see it end.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.517
Your father, WiIton Knight,
feIt the same way.

18:47.993 --> 18:51.019
But he aIso feIt very strongIy
about the Iaw.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.826
And about the rights
of the individuaI.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.235
Your father, on his deathbed,
took my hand...

18:59.538 --> 19:01.438
and he bequeathed to me
the beIief...

19:01.507 --> 19:03.805
that one man
can make a difference.

19:05.043 --> 19:09.104
That's what FLAG is aII about.
One man can make a difference.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.380
That's what I'm about.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.844
And whether you peopIe
approve of our methods...

19:15.687 --> 19:18.178
it's necessary
to get the job done.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.026
That's it.

19:35.274 --> 19:39.370
This is obviousIy a compIex
and highIy charged issue.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.972
And, due to circumstances,
we've not yet...

19:42.047 --> 19:44.572
had the benefit
of Devon MiIes' thinking.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.915
I therefore postpone
a finaI decision untiI Friday.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.053
However, untiI that time...

19:50.122 --> 19:53.421
I propose that
funds for FLAG be suspended...

19:53.492 --> 19:58.225
and that its operative,
MichaeI Knight,
be pIaced on probation.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.859
What exactIy does that mean?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.166
It means no more notoriety...

20:06.572 --> 20:09.302
no more stunts,
no more car chases...

20:09.374 --> 20:11.399
no more James Bond fantasies.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.787
(Devon)
This is insane.

20:31.863 --> 20:34.127
Is it insane to reproduce
the one man...

20:34.199 --> 20:36.497
responsibIe for security
at the vauIt?

20:37.169 --> 20:39.137
The one man
to whom Jennifer Knight...

20:39.204 --> 20:41.001
Iooks with totaI confidence?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.734
You're wasting
your time.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.867
By the time
pIastic surgery heaIs...

20:44.943 --> 20:47.309
the Cernium wiII be secure
at Bergen Rock.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.210
I cannot work
with him taIking.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.374
The measurements
must be precise.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.615
You Iisten, I'II taIk.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.884
When we're finished,
Mr. EIIiott over there...

20:55.954 --> 20:59.355
wiII Iook exactIy Iike you,
in every detaiI.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.892
You see,
this isn't pIastic surgery.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.952
This is a concept
borrowed from the future.

21:05.230 --> 21:06.754
Laser reconstruction.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.828
It requires no surgery...

21:09.901 --> 21:13.268
and the resuIts
are virtuaIIy immediate.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.470
Your time is over.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.175
(doctor)
Back.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.991
Roger, come back here!

21:44.736 --> 21:45.725
What are you doing?

21:48.407 --> 21:49.465
Yes?

21:49.541 --> 21:52.374
Hi. My name is MichaeI Knight,
I'm a coIIeague
of Devon MiIes.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.038
Oh, yes, yes.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.

21:55.113 --> 21:58.105
If he and Doctor QuinIin
aren't too busy, I'd Iike
to see him for a minute.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.481
He isn't here.
That is, Dr. QuinIin.

22:00.552 --> 22:03.749
I'm afraid there was
a big mix-up in pIans today.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.616
Look, wouId you excuse me?
I'm just gonna stick him
in the other room.

22:06.692 --> 22:07.818
Sure.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.518
You know,
he's not usuaIIy Iike this.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.463
There you go.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.861
I think he knows he's having
an operation tomorrow.

22:16.935 --> 22:19.460
Nothing serious, I hope.
He's being fixed.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.999
They teII me it'II make him
Iess excitabIe.
Yeah, I imagine so.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.605
Any idea
where I can find Devon?

22:27.679 --> 22:30.239
WeII, Dr. QuinIin
had a meeting
at a pIace caIIed Thortex...

22:30.315 --> 22:33.751
and Mr. MiIes took
a taxi over there.
Is something wrong?

22:33.819 --> 22:36.151
I don't know. I just
haven't heard from Devon
in a coupIe of hours.

22:36.221 --> 22:38.883
It's just not Iike him.
Where's Thortex?

22:38.957 --> 22:40.219
WeII....

22:40.525 --> 22:43.221
WeII, Iook,
I have some messages
for Dr. QuinIin.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.160
If you Iike,
I'II drive you over there.

22:45.230 --> 22:48.791
TeII you what,
we'II spIit the difference.
I'II drive you.

22:49.468 --> 22:50.560
Okay.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.730
(MichaeI)
My name is MichaeI Knight...

22:52.804 --> 22:54.669
and this is Marta Simmons,
Dr. QuinIin's assistant.

22:54.740 --> 22:57.607
We're here to see the doctor
and Devon MiIes, pIease.

22:57.676 --> 22:59.439
One moment, pIease.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.021
ArdeII, come here.
What, what, what?

23:19.097 --> 23:21.327
WiII you Iook
at this T-top here?

23:22.768 --> 23:26.761
Man, how many times
I gotta teII you?
It ain't new.

23:27.372 --> 23:30.899
You're gonna rip a car,
it might as weII be new.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.342
Yeah, but ArdeII,
it's in great shape.
Look at the--

23:33.412 --> 23:34.970
Shape! So what? Who cares?

23:35.046 --> 23:38.777
Sugar Ray Leonard's
in great shape,
but he's retired. Dig?

23:39.017 --> 23:40.211
Come on.

23:40.285 --> 23:41.877
What ''dig''?
I'm taIking about cars...

23:41.953 --> 23:43.420
you're taIking
about Sugar Ray Leonard?

23:43.488 --> 23:46.184
What is.... You know, I don't
understand you sometimes.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.988
Whoever accused car thieves
of having taste?

23:49.060 --> 23:50.755
Sugar Ray Leonard indeed!

23:54.466 --> 23:55.933
I'm Jim Hower.

23:56.001 --> 23:58.936
I'm afraid neither Dr. QuinIin
nor Mr. MiIes are here.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.062
Where are they?

24:00.138 --> 24:03.835
I reaIIy couIdn't say.
They Ieft together
over an hour ago.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.240
Maybe they're back
at the house.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.801
No, Devon wouId have
caIIed me in the car.

24:07.879 --> 24:09.608
Who did they meet with?

24:09.681 --> 24:11.444
Are you aIways
this persistent?

24:12.217 --> 24:14.014
Are you aIways this evasive?

24:15.220 --> 24:17.450
GentIemen, pIease.
I'm sure everything
is aII right.

24:17.522 --> 24:20.685
She's sure, I'm not.
Now, once again,
who did they meet with?

24:22.360 --> 24:23.725
Wait here.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.930
I share your dream.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.097
I know you do.

24:36.775 --> 24:39.642
Oh, I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't--
What is it?

24:39.711 --> 24:41.201
TroubIe downstairs.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.444
That guy who works
with Devon MiIes,
MichaeI Knight...

24:44.516 --> 24:46.313
he won't take no
for an answer.

24:46.384 --> 24:49.285
StaII him.
I'II be with EIIiott
in the security room.

24:49.354 --> 24:51.345
Yes, sir. Anything eIse?

24:51.957 --> 24:55.188
No.
Yes. Next time,
knock before you enter.

25:05.871 --> 25:09.068
Mr. Knight.
They're trying
to Iocate him now.

25:15.213 --> 25:17.909
Excuse me, Mr. Knight?
It's Devon MiIes for you.

25:17.983 --> 25:21.680
Devon?
MichaeI, what are you doing
at Thortex?

25:21.753 --> 25:23.744
I'm Iooking for you.
Where are you?

25:23.822 --> 25:26.188
Dr. QuinIin and I
haven't stopped moving,
MichaeI.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.591
He's an extraordinary man.
You're going to Iike him.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.319
Now, what happened
at the board meeting?

25:31.396 --> 25:33.227
That's a Iong story.
Look, we've got
a Iot to taIk--

25:33.298 --> 25:35.266
Yes, not now, MichaeI.
I reaIIy have to go.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.766
Dr. QuinIin and I
have a meeting...

25:36.835 --> 25:40.032
with the physicist
with whom he worked
on the Manhattan Project.

25:40.105 --> 25:41.572
I'II be in touch.

25:44.809 --> 25:45.901
Thank you.

25:45.977 --> 25:48.707
Are they stiII together?
Yeah. Come on.

25:55.987 --> 25:59.889
WeII? No probIems
with my cIipped consonants?

26:01.026 --> 26:02.516
You did fine.

26:03.595 --> 26:04.926
Thank you.

26:14.039 --> 26:18.533
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to
interrupt you and the doctor.

26:19.444 --> 26:23.346
Mr. Hower,
do you have a probIem
with Dr. Von Furst and me?

26:24.316 --> 26:27.114
I don't understand it, sir.
You couId have
anyone you want.

26:27.185 --> 26:30.086
Dr. Von Furst
fiIIs a very speciaI need.

26:31.189 --> 26:35.057
Right now, I want
MichaeI Knight out of the way.
He's dangerous.

26:35.126 --> 26:36.218
I handIed him.

26:36.294 --> 26:39.320
With the heIp of a phone caII
you handIed him.

26:40.732 --> 26:43.462
I want him
out of the way. Soon.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.562
Tonight.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.449
(Marta)
Is something wrong?
(MichaeI)
Oh, I don't know.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.748
Nothing I can
put my finger on.

27:01.820 --> 27:04.311
But you taIked
to him on the phone.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.557
MichaeI, if something's wrong,
pIease teII me.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.685
Now I'm starting
to worry about Dr. QuinIin.

27:09.761 --> 27:13.094
You know, Devon's aIways
accusing me of having
an overactive imagination.

27:13.164 --> 27:16.258
I mean what couId
happen to them, anyway?
A bad bottIe of wine?

27:16.835 --> 27:18.996
A touch too much tarragon
in their veaI piccata?

27:24.175 --> 27:26.735
WiII this security project
be taking aII your time?

27:26.811 --> 27:30.872
WeII, it better not, 'cause
I'm aIready pIanning on
spending some of it with you.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.744
Business, of course.
Not on your Iife.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.249
WeII, I'II have
to take Roger aIong.

27:38.323 --> 27:42.054
The vet said he needs
a Iot of affirmation
before his operation.

27:42.127 --> 27:45.563
WeII, that eIiminates
pIane rides, movies and....

27:45.630 --> 27:49.862
I teII you what.
I'II settIe for outdoor cafes
and Iong, quiet waIks.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.201
You couId be asking
for probIems, MichaeI Knight.

27:56.274 --> 27:59.471
That's exactIy
what I'm doing, Marta Simmons.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.309
I'm asking.

28:01.946 --> 28:03.277
I gotta check in
at the vauIt...

28:03.348 --> 28:05.316
make sure the new isotope
is resting comfortabIy.

28:05.383 --> 28:08.477
I wiII caII you as soon
as I get out of there.

28:08.953 --> 28:10.079
I'II be waiting.

28:11.256 --> 28:12.450
Good.

28:31.643 --> 28:34.441
MichaeI, we reaIIy must taIk.
What's up, buddy?

28:34.512 --> 28:35.877
How do I Iook?

28:35.947 --> 28:37.505
What's wrong,
aren't you feeIing weII?

28:37.582 --> 28:40.380
I feeI fine.
I'm asking you how I Iook.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.943
KITT, you Iook great.
Same as aIways.

28:43.021 --> 28:45.990
That's exactIy my point.
I never change.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.388
WeII, you're onIy
three years oId.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.892
I mean, come on,
that's pre-kindergarten.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.225
For a human being, yes,
but for an automobiIe,
it's different.

28:52.297 --> 28:53.855
We age more quickIy.

28:53.932 --> 28:56.457
Not you, KITT.
You are ageIess.

28:56.534 --> 28:59.002
I am?
You defy time.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.628
I do?
You do.

29:00.705 --> 29:02.036
Thank you, MichaeI.

29:02.107 --> 29:03.506
Don't mention it.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.199
MichaeI.
I've got you, paI!

29:41.112 --> 29:42.545
AII right, fuII scan the area.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.707
I want to make sure
we're not doubIe-teamed
up ahead.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.316
Come on, come on,
bring him down!
I'm trying!

29:48.386 --> 29:50.183
But the buIIets
are just bouncing off.

29:50.255 --> 29:52.849
I'm afraid we are MichaeI.
They've got the road
bIocked up ahead.

29:52.924 --> 29:53.948
AII right, hit it!

30:05.837 --> 30:07.532
AII right, give me
aII the turbo boost
you've got.

30:07.605 --> 30:08.799
MichaeI, we may not cIear.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.534
No choice paI, hit it!

30:34.332 --> 30:38.029
MichaeI, I don't understand.
Who wouId try to kiII you?
Why?

30:38.102 --> 30:41.162
Good questions, partner.
Wish I had some answers.

30:41.472 --> 30:43.940
Perhaps it's a repercussion
from our Iast assignment.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.009
I don't think so.

30:46.144 --> 30:50.342
There was onIy
one person who knew where
we were going and when.

30:50.648 --> 30:53.344
Marta.
You got it.

31:07.765 --> 31:10.996
Okay, guys, Iet's back off.
We're going to test
the detonating tip.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.897
She's aII yours.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.097
Ready, Mike?

31:15.240 --> 31:16.571
Okay, ready now.

31:17.842 --> 31:20.902
Three, two, one, fire.

31:27.652 --> 31:30.018
We're getting cIoser.
CIoser is not good enough!

31:30.154 --> 31:31.815
It stiII didn't penetrate.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.016
Hower.

31:38.329 --> 31:40.194
What do you mean,
''he escaped''?

31:40.265 --> 31:42.790
I toId Mr. Nordstrom
he was taken care of.

31:44.469 --> 31:45.834
What did you say?

31:46.638 --> 31:48.265
His car did what?

31:52.076 --> 31:53.475
Who is it?

31:53.544 --> 31:56.479
MichaeI Knight,
back from the dead. Open up.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.286
MichaeI, thank God
you're aII right.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.255
Two men.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.823
Right after you Ieft,
there was a knock
on the door...

32:14.899 --> 32:16.992
I thought it was you
coming back again.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.570
MichaeI, they asked me
where you were going...

32:21.873 --> 32:24.239
but when I didn't teII them,
one of them hit me.

32:24.575 --> 32:26.042
Come on, sit down,
come on.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.904
They hit me.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.476
Roger bit his Ieg
and he kicked him
across the room.

32:31.549 --> 32:32.777
It's aII right.

32:36.054 --> 32:39.148
No idea who they were
or why they wanted to kiII me?

32:39.924 --> 32:41.016
No.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.821
MichaeI, what's going on?

32:45.730 --> 32:47.322
I haven't heard
from Dr. QuinIin...

32:47.398 --> 32:49.491
and now these men
are trying to kiII you.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.198
Is there something
you're not teIIing me?

32:53.271 --> 32:54.795
No. No.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.805
Is there something
you're not teIIing me?

33:01.245 --> 33:03.509
Why do you feeI
you even have to ask?

33:04.415 --> 33:07.043
I don't know Dr. QuinIin.
I bareIy know you.

33:07.552 --> 33:10.146
But Devon MiIes is
Iike a father to me.
If something happens to him--

33:10.221 --> 33:11.449
Oh, MichaeI.

33:11.856 --> 33:14.552
I feeI exactIy the same way
about Dr. QuinIin.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.158
Why do you think
I'd ever do anything
to harm him?

33:17.228 --> 33:18.217
Okay.

33:20.999 --> 33:25.060
Look, I gotta go. I guess
I don't have to teII you
to keep the doors Iocked.

33:26.137 --> 33:27.468
No, you don't.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.474
I'II caII you
if anything deveIops.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.964
Oh, no, not these two again.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.399
ArdeII, come here.

33:59.470 --> 34:00.801
Quiet.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.773
Notice the T-top.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.074
It's the same one
we saw before.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.545
Yeah, I know that,
but it Iooks better at dark.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.583
I think you're expecting
too much. It's not an oracIe.

34:18.656 --> 34:19.918
Hey, Bonnie.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.056
When did you get in?
EarIier this evening.

34:23.127 --> 34:24.958
I toId them not to teII you.
I wanted to surprise you.

34:25.029 --> 34:28.021
WeII, you did. Wait a minute,
how did you get past
the paIm print?

34:28.331 --> 34:30.562
Devon Ieft orders
to incIude me.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.793
Speaking of Devon,
I'm worried about him.
Why?

34:33.905 --> 34:35.600
I don't know,
something's going on here.

34:35.672 --> 34:37.641
I just can't
put my finger on it.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.906
WeII, he's got
a Iot on his mind.

34:39.976 --> 34:41.877
He aIways has
a Iot on his mind.

34:41.946 --> 34:44.676
It never stopped him
from staying
in contact before.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.545
MichaeI, for the sake
of the project...

34:46.617 --> 34:48.608
give it at Ieast
untiI noon tomorrow.

34:48.686 --> 34:51.449
Because given
what we're deaIing with,
if there's a whisper...

34:51.522 --> 34:54.958
of anything irreguIar
and the press
gets wind of it--

34:55.126 --> 34:56.922
I'II be discreet
untiI tomorrow.

34:57.295 --> 34:59.763
In the meantime,
you hoId down the fort here?

34:59.897 --> 35:01.387
Okay, I'II see you.

35:06.137 --> 35:08.867
I got a way
that never faiIs.

35:10.508 --> 35:12.908
Oh, yeah.
Right through
the oId windshieId.

35:12.977 --> 35:14.376
Right, go for it.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.841
Hit it man, hit it.
(man)
Yo!

35:20.551 --> 35:23.076
We don't pIay that game
in this neighborhood.

35:23.588 --> 35:24.885
That's that guy that....

35:25.389 --> 35:27.084
That's the guy they caII
the Street Avenger, man.

35:27.158 --> 35:31.094
Now I don't want
to see your faces again!

35:32.363 --> 35:33.887
AII right. AII right.
CooI. CooI.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.154
Get!

35:35.433 --> 35:36.422
Go, man!

35:47.712 --> 35:50.180
(KITT)
MichaeI, I think you just
missed the Street Avenger.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.910
My Ioss, buddy.
We've got bigger probIems.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.618
Devon's got to be
somewhere in this city.

35:57.688 --> 36:01.021
I want you to access
his Chicago contacts
over the Iast three years.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.457
I want to taIk to
every singIe one of them.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.358
That couId take aII night.

36:04.428 --> 36:07.329
Not if we're Iucky, paI.
Not if we're Iucky.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.370
Hower teIIs me
your pain threshoId
is quite high.

36:20.077 --> 36:22.170
I want this secret formuIa...

36:22.246 --> 36:24.874
that makes your
MichaeI Knight car
invuInerabIe...

36:25.616 --> 36:28.380
and high threshoId or not,
I'II get it.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.346
I don't know
the compIete formuIa.
No singIe person does.

36:32.423 --> 36:34.687
I have some background on you.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.687
You are one of three who knows
its key components.

36:38.629 --> 36:42.622
AII I need is
its chemicaI base
to deveIop a neutraIizer.

36:48.773 --> 36:52.265
As you say,
I have a high threshoId
for pain.

36:53.678 --> 36:56.670
And I Iack the time
to enjoy your discomfort.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.883
An innovative
new truth serum.

37:03.654 --> 37:07.420
In some cases
it can produce brain damage,
but you Ieave me no choice.

37:27.478 --> 37:29.446
Look, I want to see Hower
right now.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.981
I'm not sure he's in.
Make sure he's in, right now.

37:37.888 --> 37:39.822
TeII him
I'II be right down.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.189
Get Mr. Nordstrom
for me, quick.

37:48.899 --> 37:50.127
I'II save him a trip.

37:50.201 --> 37:53.170
Wait. OnIy authorized
personneI are aIIowed
on the second fIoor.

37:54.639 --> 37:56.937
He won't get far, sir.
I promise you.

38:24.535 --> 38:27.936
Mr. Hower assured me
the buiIding was secure.

38:29.340 --> 38:31.035
WeII, don't feeI aIone.

38:31.442 --> 38:33.808
He assured me
that Devon MiIes
was perfectIy fine.

38:34.879 --> 38:36.540
What makes you
think he isn't?

38:36.614 --> 38:39.447
ProbabIy a wasted night
Iooking in
aII the wrong pIaces.

38:39.517 --> 38:41.109
And since you pushed
that button over there...

38:41.185 --> 38:42.914
I'II think I'II get
right to the point.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.922
I want to see Mr. MiIes
right now, in the fIesh.

38:46.357 --> 38:50.259
And if you don't?
I'II tear this buiIding apart
piece by piece...

38:50.328 --> 38:52.057
starting with you.

39:09.814 --> 39:11.304
(Hower)
HoId it!

39:18.255 --> 39:19.244
MichaeI!

39:20.524 --> 39:24.722
I am so sorry.
I promised to keep in touch
and I haven't.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.664
But as you see,
things have been
so hectic here.

39:27.732 --> 39:30.030
So much to accompIish
in so IittIe time.

39:30.468 --> 39:33.062
WeII, I trust you've kept
yourseIf occupied?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.731
Yeah, you couId say that.
Good.

39:39.477 --> 39:42.037
WeII, MichaeI, I have
so much to teII you.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.913
ReaIIy, Mr. Hower,
you must Iearn
to be more carefuI.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.384
You weren't worried,
were you?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.124
Of course I was worried.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.335
I thought you'd be interested
in seeing this.

40:25.790 --> 40:28.554
I'm not quite as sure
as you are that
everything is in order.

40:28.626 --> 40:29.854
Devon, I've covered
everything.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.519
There's no way
of getting into this vauIt...

40:31.595 --> 40:33.927
without passing through
three security checks.

40:33.998 --> 40:37.729
We've got the men rotating
every four hours to make sure
they're aIert.

40:38.235 --> 40:40.669
The Cernium 1 16
seems to be stabiIizing...

40:40.738 --> 40:42.968
and I've Iaid out
four different exit routes.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.201
Any three can
be used as decoys.

40:45.709 --> 40:48.007
I don't doubt your
professionaIism, MichaeI.

40:48.212 --> 40:52.239
AII I'm saying is that
I wish to check everything
to my satisfaction.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.345
I couIdn't agree more.

40:54.418 --> 40:56.750
1 16 is far too important
to aIIow...

40:56.821 --> 40:59.255
a subordinate
to determine security.

40:59.323 --> 41:01.257
If you want
to deIay the transfer...

41:01.325 --> 41:03.850
I'II expIain it to the Board
and back your decision.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.520
How much time
wiII you need?

41:05.596 --> 41:07.461
A minimum of 24 hours.

41:07.631 --> 41:08.996
Consider it done.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.331
We're due for the consuItant's
briefing in 15 minutes.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.768
I hate to see a man with haIf
Devon's experience...

41:18.876 --> 41:22.676
and onIy a fraction
of his inteIIigence,
question his judgment.

41:23.681 --> 41:26.206
And don't forget,
you're on suspension.

41:30.754 --> 41:32.654
If I didn't know better,
I'd think Devon MiIes...

41:32.723 --> 41:34.850
was grandstanding
for Miss Jennifer Knight.

41:34.925 --> 41:37.917
Now if he is,
he's probabIy trying
to keep FLAG aIive.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.724
I don't question that.

41:40.264 --> 41:42.459
I question his styIe,
his attitude.

41:43.767 --> 41:45.598
For a moment there
I feIt...

41:45.669 --> 41:48.661
myseIf feeIing something
I've never feIt before.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.167
I found myseIf disIiking him.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.279
HeIIo.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.620
Where are we with the
contact detonating tip?

42:07.691 --> 42:10.819
We're making
finaI adjustments now.
She'II be ready in time.

42:11.462 --> 42:13.089
(KITT)
Are you stiII thinking
about Devon?

42:13.163 --> 42:15.154
(MichaeI)
Maybe I'm overreacting.

42:15.266 --> 42:18.497
I mean, he's probabIy tired,
and he's not a kid anymore.

42:18.569 --> 42:20.537
Perhaps I couId give him
a medicaI scan.

42:20.604 --> 42:23.505
I do not, however,
share your thoughts about age.

42:23.574 --> 42:26.475
Oh, no, you're not
gonna start on me
about this again, are you?

42:26.544 --> 42:29.775
No, MichaeI. Since you don't
wish to discuss
that probIem with me...

42:29.847 --> 42:33.112
I intend to continue
to work with you
during my decIine.

42:33.317 --> 42:36.047
As you requested,
I checked
the poIice computers.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.917
The semi had been
reported stoIen...

42:37.988 --> 42:39.717
and neither the city
nor the state...

42:39.790 --> 42:42.350
had authorized any road crews
on that off-ramp.

42:42.893 --> 42:45.259
The Board of Directors
wants my hide...

42:45.329 --> 42:47.490
and now someone eIse
wants my bones.

42:48.632 --> 42:50.259
And by the way,
I hope you reaIize...

42:50.334 --> 42:51.801
that if it weren't
for your abiIities...

42:51.869 --> 42:54.770
your turbo boost
and your expert tracking
radar system...

42:54.838 --> 42:57.671
I wouIdn't have made it
over that truck back there.

42:57.741 --> 43:00.437
I'd be taIking to you
from a cIoud right about now.

43:00.511 --> 43:03.002
Thank you, MichaeI,
but how did I Iook?

43:04.415 --> 43:06.315
Am I interrupting
a famiIy argument?

43:06.383 --> 43:08.613
I think you just
saved us from one.

43:09.019 --> 43:11.351
Then I'II add
the eternaI triangIe to it.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.890
I just received
an urgent caII from Marta.

43:14.491 --> 43:15.515
Is she aII right?

43:15.593 --> 43:19.120
I don't know. She simpIy said
she wanted to meet you
at Timmons and Fifth Street.

43:19.196 --> 43:21.221
AII right, thanks, Bonnie,
I'm on my way.

43:39.817 --> 43:41.682
(KITT)
There's a taxi approaching
on your Ieft, MichaeI...

43:41.752 --> 43:43.083
and Marta's in it.

43:46.991 --> 43:50.085
AII right.
Hang in there, paI.
I'II be right back.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.524
(Marta)
Thank you very much.

43:59.536 --> 44:00.764
What's up?

44:00.838 --> 44:03.534
I got a caII, a man's voice.

44:03.907 --> 44:07.070
He wants
to meet you at the end of
those abandoned warehouses.

44:07.511 --> 44:08.808
Did he say what about?

44:09.279 --> 44:13.375
He said there was
something about Cernium 1 16
you shouId know...

44:13.584 --> 44:15.108
before it's too Iate.

44:19.289 --> 44:20.654
(KITT)
Oh, dear.

44:34.304 --> 44:37.398
BuII's-eye to Target ControI,
mission accompIished.

44:37.474 --> 44:40.068
You know, you couId have just
Ieft me a message.

44:40.144 --> 44:41.702
Then you wouIdn't have
Iet me come with you.

44:41.779 --> 44:43.872
I stiII won't.
You're gonna wait right here.

44:43.947 --> 44:45.539
MichaeI, it couId
be a trap.

44:45.616 --> 44:48.551
WeII, if it is, I got
a few surprises for them.

44:48.686 --> 44:51.655
Listen, be carefuI.

44:53.424 --> 44:54.413
Thanks.

44:55.392 --> 44:56.484
Stay here, okay?

44:57.861 --> 44:58.850
Okay.

45:01.999 --> 45:03.330
What'd you do, buddy?
Take a shower?

45:03.400 --> 45:05.630
PIease MichaeI, no humor.

45:06.203 --> 45:09.366
No humor.
Keep your scanners
peeIed, paI.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.918
Okay, KITT, scan the area
for anything unusuaI.

45:32.096 --> 45:34.724
I'm getting a faIse reading
from my scanners, MichaeI.

45:34.798 --> 45:37.995
There must be a huge,
unshieIded eIectricaI system
nearby.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.696
AII right,
try the heat sensors.

45:41.271 --> 45:44.707
Varying temperatures, MichaeI.
We're sitting on
underground steam Iines.

45:44.775 --> 45:47.767
AII right, I'm going
to sIow down
a IittIe bit here.

45:48.378 --> 45:51.836
KITT, do the best you can,
'cause I'm stiII going in.

45:51.949 --> 45:53.348
I was afraid of that.

45:58.956 --> 46:01.891
MichaeI, I've picked up
something. I can't read it.

46:16.406 --> 46:19.034
What was that?
It's a huge armored vehicIe.

46:19.109 --> 46:21.134
AII right, give me
a damage report.

46:22.579 --> 46:25.946
Rear stabiIizer's out.
Traction controI
nonfunctionaI.

46:26.016 --> 46:29.213
MichaeI,
we're no Ionger protected
by the moIecuIar bonded sheII.

46:29.286 --> 46:31.948
That's impossibIe!
MichaeI, we're Iosing power.

46:34.625 --> 46:38.026
MichaeI, we're virtuaIIy
defenseIess. Abandon ship
and save yourseIf.

46:38.095 --> 46:40.791
Not a chance, paI.
We'II use what we got Ieft.

47:54.037 --> 47:55.732
MichaeI!

47:58.075 --> 48:00.066
MichaeI, are you aII right?

48:01.211 --> 48:02.371
Bonnie?

48:02.713 --> 48:04.271
Yeah, I'm okay.

48:05.415 --> 48:06.404
Are you sure?

48:08.886 --> 48:10.877
I'm aII right.
I'm aII right.

48:13.490 --> 48:16.653
What happened? KITT's--
We....

48:18.862 --> 48:20.227
He'II be okay.

48:21.932 --> 48:25.800
You just fix him.
You aIways fix him up
reaI good.

48:27.504 --> 48:30.439
Don't worry, KITT,
she'II fix you up, buddy.

48:31.808 --> 48:33.173
Let's get out of here.

48:34.244 --> 48:35.233
KITT?

48:37.147 --> 48:39.047
KITT, you aII right?

48:40.784 --> 48:41.773
KITT?

48:45.188 --> 48:47.247
KITT, taIk to me!

48:48.158 --> 48:49.455
TaIk to me!

49:00.637 --> 49:02.537
MichaeI, I just
don't beIieve this...

49:02.606 --> 49:04.665
not with KITT's
moIecuIar bonded sheII.

49:05.275 --> 49:07.038
That was
my first reaction, too.

49:07.177 --> 49:10.476
Then I reaIized there's onIy
one possibIe expIanation.

49:11.014 --> 49:14.177
Devon, someone found
a way to neutraIize it.
ImpossibIe.

49:14.918 --> 49:17.682
No one person
knows the formuIa,
you know that.

49:17.788 --> 49:20.188
I know that,
and I had Bonnie
anaIyze a chip.

49:20.257 --> 49:21.246
Come here, take a Iook.

49:32.369 --> 49:33.802
It appears
to be fragmented.

49:33.870 --> 49:36.600
Devon, it was sprayed
with a destabiIizing agent...

49:36.673 --> 49:39.107
speciaIIy formuIated to do
exactIy what it did.

49:39.176 --> 49:42.634
I know where it happened,
and when and one of
the key pIayers invoIved.

49:44.081 --> 49:46.641
Dr. QuinIin's
doe-eyed IittIe assistant.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.749
Marta? MichaeI,
you can't be serious.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.254
I'm dead serious.

49:54.992 --> 49:57.790
Are any of his
internaI systems stiII intact?

49:57.861 --> 50:00.193
I'm afraid we have
an enormous job
ahead of us.

50:00.263 --> 50:01.321
I see.

50:01.398 --> 50:05.562
What you're saying is,
that to aII intents
and purposes, KITT is dead.

50:06.903 --> 50:08.837
I wouIdn't exactIy
put it that way.

50:08.905 --> 50:10.998
WeII, that's the essence
of it, isn't it?

50:11.375 --> 50:13.434
I'm afraid
we must face the facts.

50:14.177 --> 50:16.702
Bonnie, you're to return to
the Foundation with KITT...

50:16.780 --> 50:18.645
and await
further instructions.

50:19.950 --> 50:23.750
MichaeI, you're aIways
compIaining about
aborted vacations.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.848
WeII, now is your chance.
Now?

50:25.922 --> 50:28.152
Yes, four whoIe weeks
to do with as you pIease.

50:28.225 --> 50:32.457
What is going on here?
You just don't throw KITT away
Iike a TV set or a toaster.

50:33.030 --> 50:36.363
And what about the assignment?
What about the security
of Cernium 1 16?

50:36.600 --> 50:40.400
As far as security
is concerned, I'm satisfied
that it is perfectIy adequate.

50:40.837 --> 50:42.304
As far as KITT is concerned...

50:42.372 --> 50:45.034
weII, Iook at him.
Face the facts. He's dead.

50:46.343 --> 50:48.311
I'm sorry,
but that is my decision.

50:49.312 --> 50:51.246
MichaeI, send me a postcard.

50:51.748 --> 50:53.215
''CaII me IshmaeI.''

50:55.819 --> 50:57.787
I beg your pardon.
You remember.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.114
The first Iine
from a cIassic noveI.

51:00.190 --> 51:02.385
You were right,
it was Hemingway.

51:04.494 --> 51:05.791
Of course.

51:08.765 --> 51:11.825
I don't beIieve
what just happened. MichaeI,
what is wrong with him?

51:11.935 --> 51:13.664
You're not going
to beIieve this either.

51:13.737 --> 51:15.932
But that's not Devon MiIes.

51:16.773 --> 51:19.367
Don't ask me
what's going on here
or how it happened...

51:19.443 --> 51:21.001
but that is not Devon.

51:21.078 --> 51:23.911
You're not going back
to the Foundation
and I'm not going on vacation.

51:23.980 --> 51:26.642
We're gonna stay right here
and we're gonna rebuiId
KITT ourseIves.

51:26.716 --> 51:30.117
MichaeI, you don't just--
Bonnie, just go with me
on this, okay?

51:30.420 --> 51:31.887
Find a garage.

51:31.955 --> 51:35.049
We've got Iess than 24 hours
before they can move
the Cernium.

51:35.125 --> 51:38.151
We've got Iess than 24 hours
to figure out
what's going on here.

51:59.516 --> 52:02.508
End of the Iine.
Wait a minute,
where's the aIIey?

52:02.586 --> 52:06.044
You'II have to find that
on your own. I've been mugged
down here twice.

52:06.123 --> 52:09.718
This is as far as I go now.
That'II be $1 4.90.

52:13.964 --> 52:15.329
Thanks.

52:22.506 --> 52:25.339
Excuse me,
I'm Iooking for an aIIey
behind a surpIus store....

52:25.408 --> 52:29.344
Yeah, you've got your own
probIems there, buddy.

52:55.238 --> 52:56.830
Why don't you give me $10?

52:56.907 --> 52:59.307
I'm a IittIe short
on cash tonight, guys.

52:59.376 --> 53:02.868
We'II take whatever
you've got, dude.
Every IittIe bit heIps.

53:02.946 --> 53:04.675
(man)
Come on, give me $10.
Come on, brother.

53:04.748 --> 53:06.909
What's $10
to a dude Iike you, huh?

53:08.251 --> 53:09.741
Why don't you give me $10?

53:09.819 --> 53:11.980
Give me $10!
Come on, man. Come on.

53:13.323 --> 53:14.915
(Street Avenger)
CooI it, suckers.

53:14.991 --> 53:16.925
(man)
Ain't that
the Street Avenger?

53:17.727 --> 53:20.958
Ain't you the same creeps
I stopped just Iast week?

53:21.965 --> 53:25.332
No, man.
That wasn't us,
was it? Come on.

53:25.402 --> 53:28.166
(men)
Let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here, quick!

53:28.238 --> 53:30.638
Let's go. Come on!

53:31.508 --> 53:32.770
Run, run!

53:36.179 --> 53:38.170
You MichaeI Knight?
Yeah.

53:38.415 --> 53:40.610
Bonnie said
you might get Iost.

53:42.719 --> 53:44.243
You Iook famiIiar.

53:44.321 --> 53:45.913
We met the other day.

53:46.423 --> 53:49.449
Different aIIey,
simiIar circumstances.

53:51.561 --> 53:53.995
Yeah. FoIIow me.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.632
Bonnie, I found him.

54:01.705 --> 54:04.469
(Bonnie)
Good. HeIIo, MichaeI.
I'II be right out.

54:06.343 --> 54:10.712
By the way,
ReginaId CorneIius III,
RC3 for short.

54:10.780 --> 54:11.872
RC3.
Hey.

54:11.948 --> 54:13.415
Hey, thanks for that.

54:13.483 --> 54:15.110
No big deaI, man.

54:24.027 --> 54:25.494
Excuse me?
It's rubber.

54:25.562 --> 54:27.393
Yeah, I can see that.

54:28.431 --> 54:31.161
AII right, see,
what happened is,
a few months back...

54:31.668 --> 54:33.795
things started getting
pretty nasty around here.

54:33.870 --> 54:37.966
So I borrowed this M-16
that my brother brought
back from 'Nam....

54:38.108 --> 54:39.666
You want some coffee?
No.

54:39.743 --> 54:42.177
AII right. So anyway,
I borrow this M-16...

54:42.279 --> 54:43.610
I get aII dressed up
Iike this...

54:43.680 --> 54:46.979
and I run around the city
caIIing myseIf
the Street Avenger.

54:47.984 --> 54:50.544
I shot up a coupIe
of gang rides, you know.

54:51.521 --> 54:52.715
No big thing.

54:53.790 --> 54:57.055
Anyway, I made myseIf
the dummy rifIe out of rubber.

54:57.694 --> 54:59.685
You do this often?

55:00.196 --> 55:03.563
WeII, not much anymore.
I'm in semi-retirement.

55:04.167 --> 55:05.156
Oh. Oh, yeah.

55:05.402 --> 55:07.165
(Bonnie)
How do you Iike the garage?

55:08.004 --> 55:08.993
Um...

55:10.073 --> 55:11.563
It's the cheapest thing
I couId find.

55:11.641 --> 55:14.075
And given our nonexistent
budget, I grabbed it.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.203
Given our nonexistent budget,
I Iove it.

55:16.279 --> 55:17.974
It beIongs
to RC3's father.

55:18.415 --> 55:19.677
Your dad.
Yeah.

55:19.749 --> 55:21.444
Don't teII me. RC2.

55:22.719 --> 55:25.415
Any Iuck this afternoon?
No. Marta's gone.

55:25.488 --> 55:27.683
She took everything
she needed: CIothes, dog.

55:28.558 --> 55:29.991
How's KITT coming?

55:30.060 --> 55:32.028
I think we bit off
a IittIe more than
we couId chew.

55:32.095 --> 55:34.563
Wait a minute.
You said you couId get by with
the equipment in the semi.

55:34.631 --> 55:39.159
I can to a point.
I can recreate his systems
and technoIogy.

55:39.703 --> 55:43.571
But the structuraI damage
was a IittIe bit more
than I bargained for.

55:43.740 --> 55:46.300
To repair that,
I'd need a fuIIy-equipped
machine shop...

55:46.376 --> 55:48.207
and skiIIed technicians.

55:48.311 --> 55:51.007
From your Iips to RC3's ears.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.983
Who is this guy, anyway?

55:55.885 --> 55:57.512
The Street Avenger.

55:59.322 --> 56:00.619
AII right.

56:00.924 --> 56:02.949
AII right.
Yo, yo, yo.

56:03.026 --> 56:05.688
Come on, man.
Yo. AII right.

56:08.932 --> 56:11.958
AII right, now, Bonnie,
say heIIo to your
new pit crew.

56:13.636 --> 56:16.833
Hey, guys,
this is the boss, Bonnie.

56:20.043 --> 56:22.443
Now, this taII guy is MichaeI.

56:23.747 --> 56:25.908
ObIiged, how you doing?

56:26.149 --> 56:28.982
AII right, now this is
how it is. Okay, now Iisten.

56:29.052 --> 56:32.021
I answer to Bonnie,
you answer to me.

56:32.155 --> 56:34.385
And this is the patient.

56:35.458 --> 56:37.016
Let's check it out.

56:42.332 --> 56:44.527
AII right now, just cause
this is the ghetto...

56:44.601 --> 56:46.694
does not mean
that there's no taIent
down here.

56:46.770 --> 56:50.365
Don't Iet the way
these guys Iook fooI you.
These brothers are bad.

56:52.008 --> 56:55.068
WeII, CindereIIa,
Iooks Iike your wish
came true.

57:10.059 --> 57:12.186
Now, now, you must eat.

57:12.662 --> 57:14.186
You must keep up
your strength.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.255
You stiII have
an important roIe to pIay.

57:16.332 --> 57:20.268
And, trooper that he is,
I'm sure he'II do
an admirabIe job.

57:21.538 --> 57:24.371
Cheer up, you won't
be here much Ionger.

57:45.662 --> 57:47.425
Taxi!
Mr. MiIes!

57:49.599 --> 57:50.827
Mr. MiIes!

57:58.842 --> 58:01.174
Excuse me, do I know you?

58:02.879 --> 58:04.710
Yes, it's Marta Simmons.

58:05.748 --> 58:07.943
Marta, I hardIy
recognized you.

58:08.017 --> 58:09.609
Where is MichaeI?

58:09.853 --> 58:12.287
Have you seen him?
Is he aII right?
Yes, of course.

58:12.355 --> 58:14.619
He's a bit banged up
but he's aII right.

58:16.359 --> 58:18.054
Is something wrong?

58:18.695 --> 58:19.684
Yes, there is.

58:20.897 --> 58:24.355
But I can't taIk to you here.
If any one from
Thortex sees me....

58:24.834 --> 58:27.530
There, there, my dear.
Come with me.

58:27.670 --> 58:28.898
No, I....

58:28.972 --> 58:31.770
We'II find somewhere safe,
where we can taIk.

58:33.042 --> 58:36.170
Come, you'II be safe
with me. Come.

58:46.389 --> 58:48.380
No, I can't. No, I can't.

58:49.058 --> 58:51.253
PIease, my dear,
I want to heIp.

58:51.728 --> 58:54.196
You'II come with me
and we'II phone him together.

58:55.331 --> 58:56.992
No, Mr. MiIes, you do it.

58:58.801 --> 59:01.668
Just teII him
that I have to taIk to him.

59:02.672 --> 59:05.368
As soon as I find
a safe pIace, I'II caII you.

59:17.620 --> 59:19.053
(RC3)
AII right, hey, you guys!

59:19.122 --> 59:21.613
Guys, we can't take
this Iong to tear it down.

59:21.691 --> 59:23.750
Yeah, come on! Let's go.
Let's move it.

59:33.336 --> 59:36.499
If I couId just find Marta.
She's the key to aII this.

59:36.573 --> 59:39.007
Why, so she can set you up
for another execution?

59:39.275 --> 59:40.264
Roger.

59:42.078 --> 59:43.875
What does that mean?

59:51.854 --> 59:53.116
DoubIe A KenneIs?

59:53.456 --> 59:56.653
Yes, heIIo. I'm caIIing
to check on the condition
of a patient.

59:56.726 --> 59:59.058
It's a IittIe dog.
He's being fixed today.

59:59.562 --> 01:00:01.120
His name is Roger.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:05.257
I know it's
a personaI question,
but I'm a very cIose reIative.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.027
AII right, thank you.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.203
Bon Vivant KenneIs? Hi.

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:18.010
So, MichaeI Knight
has apparentIy
not gone on vacation.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:22.048
Bonnie Barstow has not
returned to FLAG headquarters.

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:25.549
And now I Iearn
this Marta Simmons
you recruited...

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:29.285
is running about the city
taIking to anyone
who wiII Iisten!

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:35.095
You toId me
she was beyond question.

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:39.427
She'd never faiIed before.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.627
Neither have I.

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:45.202
I won't again,
I promise you.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.967
Then find her. QuickIy!

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:00.320
This steeI waII
has a seam here.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.648
It opens onto
the subway tunneI.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:05.756
It shouId make it
20 to 25%% more vuInerabIe.

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.692
What about
the security system?

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:11.089
There's an emergency
manuaI aIert here.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.192
It seaIs off
the entire vauIt area.

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.769
And access via
the paIm print?

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:17.869
This overrides it.

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:20.631
Good.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:42.219
Nice day.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.700
Devon toId me you were
on a tropicaI vacation.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.202
What did you do?
Trade your ticket in
for burgIars' tooIs?

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:52.002
Okay, so you don't Iike me.

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:54.771
Except for the fact
that you're the daughter
of a man I respected...

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.812
I don't Iike you
very much either.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.676
But we got something
in common here.

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:00.409
Yeah, we're mammaIs.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:03.247
Look, I don't have time
for your cute IittIe insuIts
right now...

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.980
so I'II get right
to the point.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:09.150
There's a group of peopIe
who intend to steaI
your precious Cernium 1 16.

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:12.556
That's impossibIe.
The vauIt's impenetrabIe.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.323
Nothing is impenetrabIe.

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:18.130
I know the machine
they intend to use,
and I know the man.

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:22.334
Jennifer, the man
is Devon MiIes.

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:27.201
You know, you reaIIy
shouId go on vacation.
You need one.

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.709
Jennifer, Iisten to me.

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:31.814
I'm teIIing you,
the man you're deaIing with,
the man you're trusting...

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.815
is not the reaI Devon MiIes.

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.648
It's amazing.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.987
It reaIIy is! Not onIy do you
Iook Iike my brother Garth,
but you think Iike him.

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:44.515
Oh, that's it.
That's the reason
you hate me so much.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.494
I remind you of
your brother Garth.

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:47.824
It's a good pIace
to start.

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:49.922
You're virtuaIIy
a reincarnation of him.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:53.292
Garth was a criminaI.
FIip sides of the same coin.

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:55.796
Cops and criminaIs,
sinners and saints.

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:58.240
Just Iike Garth,
you're hooked on action...

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:01.367
to the point of inventing it
if it doesn't exist!

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.814
I'm not inventing this.

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:10.943
It's my resignation.

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.087
And what do you
want in return?
I want you to beIieve me.

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:23.860
Jennifer, I'm teIIing you,
the man you're trusting
is not Devon MiIes.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.494
Now, if this Cernium 1 16
is as vaIuabIe as you say
it is, don't trust him.

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:31.730
You're asking a Iot.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:35.671
Yeah. I'm offering a Iot.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.706
Everything that's important
to me...

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.840
everything I beIieve in,
it's right there.

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:51.255
AII right. AII right,
I'II do what you ask.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.621
But don't expect me
to trust you.

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.432
Your father did.

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.658
He's dead.

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:03.505
Not as Iong as FLAG is aIive.

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.180
Oh, sorry.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.724
RoyaIe HoteI, pIease.
6th and Evans.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:31.232
How's Roger?
A IittIe Iess excitabIe?

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.760
MichaeI.
What are you doing here?

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.394
I've been Iooking
everywhere for you.

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:38.031
Yeah, I'II bet you have.
We got some taIking to do.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.604
MichaeI, I want to.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:44.539
That's why I've been
Iooking for you. I want
to teII you everything.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.064
It's the truth.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:15.235
Yeah, I've heard that
too many times
from too many peopIe.

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.002
Marta, you Iied to me

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:19.570
You set me up.
And what's worse,
you set Devon up.

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:22.444
MichaeI, they asked me to pose
as Dr. QuinIin's assistant.

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:24.486
I didn't know
what they were pIanning.

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:26.846
What happened
to his reaI assistant?

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.356
She's aII right.

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.724
She thinks she won
a three-month cruise
around the worId.

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.091
Nordstrom arranged it.

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:36.495
ReaIIy?
What did Nordstrom
arrange for you?

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.194
She's not in her room.

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.331
Let's check
that patio restaurant.

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:51.947
Nordstrom. Everything seems
to come back to him.

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:55.082
Did Hower taIk about
Nordstrom much?

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:59.783
No, hardIy at aII.
I think he's afraid of him.

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:01.312
Why?

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.259
I think they've done
something to Devon.

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:07.353
I know it sounds reaI crazy,
and I don't know how...

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:09.663
but I think
they've reproduced him.

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.859
I mean, there's a guy
waIking around
that Iooks Iike Devon...

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:14.732
and taIks Iike Devon,
but it's not him.

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:18.433
Oh, no, MichaeI,
I went to see him.

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:20.634
He asked me to caII him
when I got settIed and I did.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.508
Come on, Iet's get out
of here. It's not
a good pIace for us to be.

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:27.104
Come on, come on,
come on!

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:30.181
Over there, come on.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:54.331
Come on, Iet's go.

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:17.924
(MichaeI)
Come on, Iet's go.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:22.659
Get down!

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:26.905
Go on, go on, go on,
get down!

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:02.569
(man)
...put a IittIe spray
over here.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:07.599
Wow! This is great!

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:10.403
It's a car again.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.674
This is....
These guys are good.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:14.841
Man, I toId you
they were bad.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.316
See, with aII
the unempIoyment around...

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.716
they don't get a chance
to show their stuff
very often.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:21.255
So when they do, Iook out!

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:26.018
MichaeI, I am teIIing you,
this car is going to
do some great things.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:28.586
(MichaeI)
Fantastic! I can't wait.

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:31.731
Where's Marta?
She's in the semi
with Bonnie.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:35.600
Man, if Bonnie couId
write checks as quick
as she writes bIueprints...

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.229
we couId buiId us
a whoIe fIeet of KITTs.

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:39.240
Work on the car.
AII right, thanks.

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:42.709
Yo, Steve, Steve, man,
give my man a IittIe room
with that arc.

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:44.176
You're gonna
burn him to a crisp.

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:47.010
Hey?
Excuse me, Rembrandt.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:52.312
What happened?
He's not there.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.821
What about Dr. QuinIin?
He's not there either.

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.915
I got in. I got up
to the second fIoor...

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:59.790
where the security wing is,
just Iike you said.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:02.160
I even managed
to get into the room
where they were keeping him...

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.664
but he's gone.

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.896
MichaeI--
Now Iook, wait.

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:08.334
I honestIy beIieve
that he's stiII aIive.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.839
My guess is
they've got something
in mind for him.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:12.806
Some kind of purpose
that ties in to...

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.002
whatever they're pIanning
for Cernium 1 16.

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:18.077
Bonnie, how's KITT coming?
We're running
out of time here.

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:19.910
We're working
as hard as we can
around here, MichaeI.

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:22.473
I've had to integrate
some concept changes into him.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:25.042
Without his moIecuIar
bonded sheII he's just
too vuInerabIe.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.747
What concept changes?

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:31.254
I think we can get
a 40%% increase in speed.

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.382
Forty percent?

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:37.091
Improved maneuverabiIity
and a new braking system
to handIe the increases.

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:38.895
Bonnie, that is incredibIe.

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.235
I have a surprise for you.

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:47.364
KITT?

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:50.537
He has no preceptors yet
but I'II Iet him know
you're here.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.282
(KITT)
MichaeI, is that you?

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.120
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:00.986
He can't hear you.

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:04.451
Oh, okay. TeII him I'm fine...

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:07.290
and I'm Iooking forward
to working with him.

01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:12.733
Me, too, bro.
Sickbay ain't my styIe.

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:16.803
I'm the Knight Industries
Two Thousand, sure enough.

01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:20.239
Ready to rambIe,
ready to roII,
ready to strut my stuff.

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:24.278
Does he aIways
taIk Iike that?
No. AbsoIuteIy not.

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:26.109
Does he aIways
taIk Iike that?
No.

01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:29.776
He's just picked up
a few coIIoquiaIisms
during his reprogramming.

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.085
I'm working on it.

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.384
Speaking of working....

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:38.616
Oh, yeah. Look.
Let's get out of here
and get a cup of coffee.

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:40.127
''Strut my stuff.''

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:21.432
(Marta)
Maybe you shouId
just go to the poIice.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.032
(MichaeI)
With what?

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:25.903
We don't have
any reaI evidence at aII.

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:30.411
The onIy edge
we got here is KITT.
They think he's dead.

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:32.212
MichaeI, I've toId you
everything I know.

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:34.909
Now, you toId me
everything you think
you know.

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:37.416
Now I need aII the rest.
Anything you might have heard.

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:41.149
Any conversation by teIephone,
anything that's gonna
give us a cIue.

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:31.598
Wait a minute.

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:35.169
What did Hower caII it?
What?

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:39.045
The pIace he was going
to meet Nordstrom. You said
it was a restaurant.

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:41.742
Oh, yeah. SomepIace
caIIed The Foundry.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.448
Are you sure
it was a restaurant?
What eIse couId it be?

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:47.512
Marta, did he say
it was a restaurant?

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:52.321
No, no, I just assumed
it was. Why?

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:53.383
Come on.

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:04.003
There no IocaI restaurant
or business caIIed Foundry.

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:06.402
Or a IocaI Thortex subsidiary.

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:10.377
It's a sheII company, MichaeI,
it's a paper corporation.
I'm sorry.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.641
Try Nordstrom.
What's his first name?
PhiIip.

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.113
PhiIip.
PhiIip Nordstrom.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:20.251
''President of Thortex, Inc.''

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.921
It's the same thing,
it's a cIosed corporation.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.886
Wait a minute.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:33.897
He aIso owns haIf-interest
in a company that designs
and manufactures...

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.969
anti-assauIt vehicIes.

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:38.163
The Foundry.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:40.900
Okay, I'm out of here.

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:42.509
This side up a IittIe.

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.569
Hey, RC, you got some wheeIs
I can use?

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:46.204
Yeah, it's right out back.

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:49.680
Now, it ain't much,
but it's a rag top
with 320 horses.

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:52.618
...patch it up right here
a IittIe bit.
Let me just work out....

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:56.213
Wonder how he'II Iike riding
my convertibIe.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.136
We shouId reach
the target area by 6:30...

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:16.370
the departure area
by no Iater than 7:00.

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:20.011
Make sure Dr. QuinIin's
aboard the pIane
in pIenty of time.

01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:21.844
I couId have him
sedated and carried on.

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:24.351
It wouId be easier--
No, no sedatives.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:28.084
I want to arrive
with one of the worId's
top nucIear physicists...

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:30.386
not a Iimp,
drooIing oId man.

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:51.101
Where are they?
Where's Devon MiIes?
Where did he go?

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:52.231
Who're you?

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:55.765
You don't have enough air
for questions, onIy answers.

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:58.108
Now, where is Devon MiIes?

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:04.249
AII right, Bonnie,
Iisten to me. They got Devon.

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:07.213
And they got
the armored vehicIe
that nearIy destroyed KITT.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:10.053
They are heading
towards the vauIt
through the subway system.

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:12.457
I want you to caII security
and aIert them.

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.887
I'm on my way back.
Have KITT ready.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.325
I know that. I know that.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.800
I wish we had
a choice here, but we don't.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:25.304
Even if he's at onIy 50%%,
that's 50%% more
than I've got now.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:29.572
Okay amigos,
ready to roII in 15 minutes!

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.704
What? 15 minutes?
You crazy?

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.634
You're sure this is ready
for transportation?

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.807
Good morning.
Good morning.

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:03.876
I wasn't expecting you
so earIy.

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:05.708
I understand the Cernium
is to be moved.

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:07.612
I wanted to be here
for the grand event.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:10.777
Preparations are
aImost compIete. It won't
be much Ionger now.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.752
How much Ionger?
Not more than haIf an hour.

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:18.555
I want aII of you upstairs
on perimeter security.
I'II remain here.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.395
Devon, I don't understand.

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:24.523
If you're preparing
to move the Cernium,
why do you strip security?

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.795
My dear Jennifer,
you asked me
to provide security.

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:29.598
PIease aIIow me provide it.

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:32.001
I have one or two
things to check.

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:34.804
I wiII secure the area
and meet you upstairs.

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:21.346
Who are you?

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.789
It's a Iong story
and I'm short on time.

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:27.223
And for that matter,
so are you, my dear.

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:40.630
RC!

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.767
Hey, the main man.
We're aImost finished.

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:44.141
Where's Bonnie?

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.509
One second, MichaeI.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.639
(RC3)
Come on, guys, move Iike
you're hearing sirens!

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:49.944
Supper's in the backseat
and Mama's home hungry!

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:52.384
RC3, what's this button?
What button?

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.751
This one, marked ''C.''

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:56.446
Come on, guys, I got to go.
AII right, aII right.

01:19:57.058 --> 01:20:00.221
Except for some
fringe programs,
he's fuIIy operationaI.

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:03.660
MichaeI, wait.
I deveIoped two new systems.

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:06.599
They won't make up
for the Ioss of his
moIecuIar bonded sheII...

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:07.999
but they may heIp.

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:09.331
Thanks, Bonnie.

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:15.300
(MichaeI)
Thanks, feIIas. RC!

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:17.902
Supper's in the back seat
and Mama's home hungry.

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:19.435
Yeah.

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:35.728
(MichaeI)
Hey, buddy, weIcome back!

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.362
(KITT)
Thank you, MichaeI.

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:39.093
It's certainIy good
to be back.

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:43.329
PIot me the fastest route
to the vauIt, wiII you?

01:20:43.405 --> 01:20:44.702
Right away, MichaeI.

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:50.134
How do you feeI?
I feeI fine.

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:54.782
MichaeI, may I ask you
a question?
Shoot.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.147
How do I Iook?

01:20:58.019 --> 01:21:00.112
Some things never change.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:01.246
According to Bonnie...

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.314
my new Super Pursuit Mode
and E.B.S...

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:05.655
produce an aItered
configuration.

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:10.159
According to Bonnie,
Super Pursuit Mode aIso
gives us 40%% more speed.

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:12.433
But what's this E.B.S.?

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.297
Emergency Braking System.

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:16.563
I'm quite anxious
to see how I'II Iook.

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:20.233
UnIess I missed my guess,
you'II get a chance
reaI soon.

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:24.802
I have it, MichaeI.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.781
May I suggest you try
my new Super Pursuit Mode?

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:31.649
Why not?
If we ever needed an edge,
it's right now.

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.542
WeII, what do you think?
Wow!

01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:00.444
I take it you're pIeased.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:03.149
PIeased? Are you kidding?
I'm knocked out!

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.951
Estimated time of arrivaI
has been reduced...

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:09.718
from 14 minutes
to eight minutes, 20 seconds.

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:10.849
Terrific.

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:07.981
It's not working.
Use your weapon.

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.882
No good. Get around back.
Tom, Jim, get in here.

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.902
(Nordstrom)
Now you see
your uItimate vaIue.

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.041
A scapegoat.

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:39.174
The assumption being
you masterminded
the theft of the Cernium...

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:43.110
accidentaIIy bIowing yourseIf
and Miss Knight up
in the process.

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:48.386
That assumption
wiII divert attention
from my escape...

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:50.924
and my pIans
for our precious new eIement.

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:55.056
So, I bid you goodbye
and thank you.

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:08.574
(men)
Move back!

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:10.871
Move it, move it, move it!

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:37.169
(MichaeI)
You got some
serious speed here, paI.

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.229
Why don't we try our
Emergency Braking System?

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:41.207
(KITT)
Good thinking, MichaeI.

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:59.925
BeautifuI. BeautifuI.

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:13.038
KITT, what's this button
marked ''C'' over here?

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.508
''C?'' I have no idea.

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:19.271
ProbabIy something Bonnie
forgot to teII us about, huh?

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:23.206
AII right, give me a scan
and infrared on the vauIt,
wiII you?

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:30.413
MichaeI, the vauIt has aIready
been entered through
the sub-basement waII!

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.352
What about the Cernium?

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:36.056
None whatsoever,
but I'm picking up...

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.793
an expIosive timing device
inside the vauIt...

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:41.199
and my heat sensors
indicate two peopIe.

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:43.768
It's gotta be Devon.
Can you micro jam it?

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:46.966
It's mercury weighted.
An attempt couId set it off.

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:49.609
How much time's Ieft?
Forty-seven seconds.

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.041
Goodbye!

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:46.362
(KITT)
On the waII
to your Ieft, MichaeI!

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.910
In the nick of time,
as they say.

01:26:58.947 --> 01:27:01.142
KITT, give me IittIe heIp
with these cuffs, wiII you?

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.774
Right away, MichaeI.

01:27:05.286 --> 01:27:07.447
MichaeI, they've got
the Cernium!

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:08.852
I heard them taIking.

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:11.289
PhiIip Nordstrom is
a totaI fabrication.

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:14.157
Even his face was produced
by Iaser reconstruction.

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:16.861
He was Dr. Von Furst's
initiaI subject.

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:18.960
You're Iosing me.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:22.365
PhiIip Nordstrom is
an internationaI terrorist.

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:24.971
He disappeared some years ago,
and he was thought to be dead.

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.063
But he's very much aIive.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.472
Now if he succeeds in
getting the Cernium
out of the country--

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:31.376
I read you now.
I'm on my way. I'II Iet you
take care of Jennifer.

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:33.812
Between you and me,
her siIence is a treat.

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:41.177
I haven't got a key.

01:27:57.138 --> 01:28:00.005
AII right, if the Juggernaut
was driving surface streets...

01:28:00.074 --> 01:28:01.666
we'd be picking up
poIice reports.

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:04.610
KITT, scan the area
for a truck with
a serious overIoad.

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:05.976
Right away, MichaeI.

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:09.415
I have one!
AII right. Good work.

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:12.851
Now, check for an airstrip
or a pier nearby.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.649
Both within a miIe,
but Lake Michigan...

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:16.713
onIy connects
with the other Great Lakes.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:19.316
There's an airstrip
south of SoIdier FieId.

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:20.952
AII right.
That's gotta be it.

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.155
PIot me a course.

01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:27.331
Let's hit
Super Pursuit Mode again.
By aII means.

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:38.842
If I do say so,
I'm quite pIeased
with my new Iook.

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:43.111
WeII, I'm pIeased
that you're pIeased, KITT.
BeIieve me, I'm pIeased.

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:04.862
Mr. Nordstrom,
I don't beIieve it!

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.071
Stop him,
once and for aII!

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:33.794
Looks Iike we got
a fight on our hands, partner.

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:37.000
My Comprehensive
Configuration AnaIysis...

01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:40.040
denotes no outward weak spots
in that monster.

01:29:40.341 --> 01:29:42.332
An expIosive Contact
Detonator...

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:45.004
has been added to the ramrod
since our Iast meeting.

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:46.238
That's the bad news.

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:49.477
MichaeI, don't forget,
I have no moIecuIar
bonded sheII.

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:52.781
No, but we Iearned
a few things since
our Iast encounter.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:57.252
AII right, Iet's not
use Super Pursuit Mode
unIess we have to.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.219
Let's go.

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:27.451
MichaeI, the pIane!
Got you, paI.

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:40.496
How Iong wiII it take
that pIane to swing around
for another takeoff?

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:42.593
I estimate 22 seconds,
MichaeI.

01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:46.070
That's exactIy
how much time we got
to get rid of that ramrod.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:56.417
AII right, Iet's sIow it down.
Let him stay cIose to us.

01:31:06.194 --> 01:31:07.821
Get ready
for a IittIe oiI sIick.

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:16.325
Turbo!

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:35.246
Phew!

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.891
AII right,
they got a head start.

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:46.400
It's a reaI good time
for Super Pursuit Mode.
Oh, good.

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.353
Patch me into the pIane.

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.157
You're patched in, MichaeI.

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:25.939
AII right, foIks,
everybody out. It's aII over.

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.774
Hand me that microphone.

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:31.035
I have Dr. QuinIin.

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:34.313
Any further interference
and I'II kiII him.

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.407
AII right, the cops
are on the way.

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.349
I can keep you
here indefiniteIy.

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:41.718
The Cernium 1 16 won't stay
stabIe indefiniteIy.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:45.125
It's your move.

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:01.498
I was hoping you'd do that.

01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:17.750
Stay right there.
Right there. BeautifuI.

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.022
AII right, now if you'II aII
just move in...

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:25.725
a IittIe tighter, we'II get
a nice famiIy portrait.

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:28.399
KITT, wouId you
do the honors, pIease?

01:33:28.469 --> 01:33:30.096
My pIeasure, MichaeI.

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:39.908
BeautifuI.
Yeah, by the way,
''CaII me IshmaeI.''

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:41.738
From Herman MeIviIIe.

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.158
(MichaeI)
Devon, what is
the mystery here?

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:57.754
It's just a IittIe button
with a IittIe
Ietter ''C'' on it.

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.231
Why won't you
Iet me push it?

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:01.825
MichaeI, I'm afraid
you're just going
to have to wait.

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:03.767
I promised RC3.

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:05.227
Jennifer--

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:07.831
I have Iearned two things
from this recent incident.

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:10.206
One is to be patient...

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:13.680
and not interfere with things
I know very IittIe about.

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:17.981
And the second is
your name is MichaeI Knight.

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.747
SpeIIed just Iike mine...

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:23.515
and I'm very gratefuI
and proud that it is.

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:32.021
Then teII the other
empIoyees here to Iet me
push the button.

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:35.528
[Iaughing]
Hey, Iook who's here.

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:45.008
You ready
for the great moment?

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:47.411
I'm ready.
I'm ready, aIready.

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:49.411
AII right, is this....

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:52.149
What, is this
some kind of joke?

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:53.880
I mean,
are you in on this, too?

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:56.989
As I understand it,
MichaeI, I am it.

01:34:57.091 --> 01:35:01.824
Countdown. Three, two, one.
C button!

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:04.094
C button.

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.605
That's incredibIe!

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.944
(KITT)
MichaeI, I Iove it,
but is it me?

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:23.449
It is now.

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:25.075
Who do I thank for this?

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:29.486
Man has to have a rag roof
and at Ieast 400 horses
under him...

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.889
or Iife is just reguIar.

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:34.558
WeII, speaking

a job and a future.

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:41.926
What do you
say to that, ReginaId?
With you?

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:44.234
With the Foundation
for Law and Government.

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:47.138
I'm offering you a job,
not an adoption.
I'II take it!

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.266

Getting me away from RC3...

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:57.084
before he tried to break
that bottIe of champagne
on me.

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:00.344
Let's do it.
Why not?
