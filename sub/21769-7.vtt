00:01.001 --> 00:03.804
OKAY, DINNER IS SERVED.

00:03.871 --> 00:05.272
RAMEN AGAIN.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.039
NOT JUST RAMEN.

00:06.106 --> 00:10.277
GEORGIA CHAMBERLAIN'S
FAMOUS PEANUT SESAME RAMEN.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.212
IS THAT A REESE'S PIECE?

00:12.279 --> 00:14.014
NO.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.984
THAT'S A FLAVOR NUGGET,

00:17.050 --> 00:19.520
A BLUE FLAVOR NUGGET.

00:19.586 --> 00:23.457
WHOO!
WHO WANTS LOBSTER TAILS?

00:23.524 --> 00:25.859
LEFTOVERS
FROM MY PARTY LAST NIGHT.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.060
REGIS PHILBIN
HAD ALREADY EATEN.

00:27.127 --> 00:30.097
SO LIKE HIM.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.099
IF YOU COULD JUST PUT
IT DOWN, I'LL GO GET
MY BIB.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.734
NO, NUH-UH.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.036
JO, NOW WE DECIDED
SINCE WE'RE STAYING
HERE RENT-FREE

00:36.103 --> 00:38.038
WE'RE GONNA PAY OUR WAY
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:38.105 --> 00:41.008
BUT IF WE DON'T EAT IT,
THEN THOSE CUTE LOBSTERS

00:41.074 --> 00:43.610
WILL HAVE GIVEN UP
THEIR TAILS FOR NOTHING.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.680
YOU KNOW THEY GAVE UP MORE
THAN THEIR TAILS, RIGHT?

00:46.747 --> 00:49.716
LA LA LA LA LA!
THEY CUT OFF THEIR TAILS
AND THE TAILS GROW BACK!

00:49.783 --> 00:51.485
LA LA LA LA LA!

00:51.552 --> 00:54.188
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

00:54.254 --> 00:58.158
OH, I'M SORRY, GIRLS.
YOU TWO JUST KEPT
GOING ON AND ON.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.260
I GOT PECKISH.

01:04.264 --> 01:07.167
SO WHAT ARE YOU GIRLS
DOING TONIGHT BESIDES
STARVING YOURSELVES

01:07.234 --> 01:09.036
FOR NO DAMN GOOD REASON?

01:09.102 --> 01:11.939
WE HAVE A VERY BIG NIGHT.

01:12.005 --> 01:15.709
I'M GOING UP TO MY SCHOOL
TO SEE THE STUDY SPACE
THEY ASSIGNED ME.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.044
( GASPS )

01:17.110 --> 01:19.046
AND THEN WE HAVE
A VERY BIG NIGHT.

01:19.112 --> 01:22.516
- WE'RE GOING TO THE HOTTEST
CLUB IN NEW YORK.
- OH?

01:22.583 --> 01:25.986
LIKE TEMPERATURE-WISE?
DO I NEED TO BRING
MY BOY DEODORANT?

01:26.053 --> 01:29.189
IT'S CALLED 1104,
AND IT'S AN UNDERGROUND PLACE.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.891
YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHERE IT IS TO GET IN.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.593
- SO WHERE IS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:32.659 --> 01:35.863
BUT WHEN I FIND IT,

01:35.929 --> 01:38.031
BEYONCE, LADY GAGA

01:38.098 --> 01:40.033
AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE,
CUTIE,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.769
ARE GONNA BE OUR FRIENDS.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.772
- WOW!
I'M ALREADY SWEATING.
- I KNOW.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.609
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF TROUBLE
JUST TO FIND A PLACE
TO HANG OUT.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.978
WHERE WE HANG<i>HAS</i>
TO BE THE RIGHT PLACE
SO WE CAN BE SEEN,

01:51.044 --> 01:53.180
SO WE CAN MEET
THE RIGHT PEOPLE

01:53.247 --> 01:54.815
AND MAYBE EVEN
GET DISCOVERED.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.985
THAT REMINDS ME
OF WHEN I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE IT IN NEW YORK.

01:58.051 --> 02:01.255
LONGEST THREE DAYS
OF MY LIFE.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.825
ONE NIGHT
AT THE ALGONQUIN

02:04.892 --> 02:07.227
I MET MR. DUPREE.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.597
NOW THE RULES
OF THE LADIES HOTEL
WHERE I WAS LIVING

02:10.664 --> 02:12.766
WAS THAT IF YOU HAD
A GENTLEMEN CALLER,

02:12.833 --> 02:16.570
YOU HAD TO KEEP
THREE FEET ON THE FLOOR
AT ALL TIMES.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.140
LUCKY FOR MR. DUPREE,
I WAS POSSESSED

02:20.207 --> 02:23.076
WITH AN ALMOST
FREAKISH FLEXIBILITY.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.347
SO WE ELOPED
AND HE BROUGHT ME HERE.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.249
SO HOW DID YOU END UP
WITH THE APARTMENT UPSTAIRS?

02:29.316 --> 02:31.985
WELL, WHEN
MR. DUPREE PASSED,

02:32.052 --> 02:34.154
THE DIVORCÃ‰ UPSTAIRS

02:34.221 --> 02:36.690
WAS KIND ENOUGH
TO CONSOLE ME.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.693
SO YOU STARTED
ON THE 18TH

02:39.760 --> 02:42.029
AND YOU MARRIED
INTO 19.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.398
AND I GOT MY EYE

02:44.464 --> 02:47.067
ON THAT WIDOWER ON 21.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.236
BUT WHAT ABOUT 20?

I AM ALSO SENSING
THAT YOU'RE B.F.F.S,
YOU'RE NEW IN TOWN,

05:53.754 --> 05:55.022

11:41.835 --> 11:43.637
DESPERATE.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.606
NO, I AM NOT DESPERATE,

11:45.672 --> 11:47.641
AND I WILL DO ANYTHING
TO PROVE THAT I BELONG
IN THERE

11:47.708 --> 11:50.611
IN A VERY NON-DESPERATE,

11:50.677 --> 11:54.181
YOU KNOW,
SWAGGED-OUT KIND OF WAY.

11:54.248 --> 11:56.683
THERE'S A BAR DOWN
THE STREET-- MICKEY'S.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.186
- I KNOW THAT PLACE.
- SHH! NO, WE DON'T.

11:59.253 --> 12:00.988
GO TO MICKEY'S,

12:01.054 --> 12:04.258
GET THE PORTRAIT OF MICKEY
HANGING FROM BEHIND THE BAR,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.527
ALSO A PLATE OF WINGS.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.695
SOME WINGS
AND A PORTRAIT.

12:10.531 --> 12:11.498
CAN WE GET IN THEN?

12:11.565 --> 12:14.067
OH, YEAH,
PARTY LIKE ROCK STARS.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.540
I DON'T WANNA DO THIS.
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT BREAKING RULES.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.309
THIS ISN'T BREAKING A RULE, JO.
THIS IS PLAYING A LITTLE PRANK

12:22.376 --> 12:24.711
ON YOUR BUDDY PATRICK HERE
WHO WE'LL NEVER SEE AGAIN,

12:24.778 --> 12:27.381
BECAUSE WE'LL BE HANGING
AT 1104.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.552
- GEORGIA AND JO.
- HEY.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.854
NOT SURE WHY YOU'RE BACK.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.023
I THINK IT MIGHT
INVOLVE DIRECTIONS,

12:36.089 --> 12:38.559
BUT IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU ANYWAY.

12:38.625 --> 12:42.095
ACTUALLY, WE WOULD
LIKE A DOZEN WINGS.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.599
WOW, WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU GUYS WIN THE LOTTERY?

12:45.666 --> 12:48.635
ROB A MALL FOUNTAIN?

12:48.702 --> 12:52.472
NO NO NO NO.
WE ARE NOT ROBBERS.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.275
WE'RE PRANKSTERS.
I'M HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.445
OKAY, WE'LL DO IT
TOGETHER, SWEETHEART.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.180
OKAY, YOU GOT YOUR ORDER IN

13:00.247 --> 13:03.817
SO THE PRESSURE IS OFF.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.752
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

13:07.588 --> 13:11.458
ALL RIGHT, NOW HERE'S
THE PICTURE AND HERE'S
HOW WE'RE GONNA GET IT DOWN.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.360
WHEN HE COMES BACK
WITH THE WINGS,

13:13.427 --> 13:16.463
WE'RE GONNA DISTRACT HIM
AWAY FROM THE BAR,
GRAB IT AND RUN.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.999
HOW ARE WE GONNA DISTRACT
HIM AWAY FROM THE BAR?

13:19.066 --> 13:20.968
STAY RIGHT THERE.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.380
- HIDE IT.
- PEACH SCHNAPPS?

13:33.447 --> 13:36.049
HIDE IT!

13:36.116 --> 13:38.986
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
YOUR WINGS.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.188
THANK YOU, PATRICK.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.591
I WAS ALSO THINKING
THAT I WOULD LIKE
A REAL DRINK.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.828
UM... YEAH.
A FUZZY NAVEL.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.497
YOU WANT THAT
<i>AND</i>A REAL DRINK?

13:50.564 --> 13:53.267
WELL, WHERE I'M FROM,
IT'S QUITE POPULAR.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.003
I THINK THEY MAKE IT
WITH PEACH SCHNAPPS,
I BELIEVE.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.505
- OH.
- AHEM.

13:58.572 --> 13:59.473
HUH. I'M OUT
OF PEACH SCHNAPPS.

13:59.540 --> 14:01.909
DOES THAT HAPPEN OFTEN?

14:01.975 --> 14:04.645
USUALLY JUST
ON PROM NIGHT.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.114
- WE SHOULD HAVE
MORE IN THE BACK.
- THANKS FOR THAT.

14:07.181 --> 14:08.549
LET'S GO.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.689
THAT WAS AMAZING, JO.
YOU GOTTA GET OVER THIS BAR.

14:15.756 --> 14:18.458
- CAN WE JUST STEAL
THE MAN'S PICTURE AND LEAVE?
- YES.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.561
- CAN I HAVE ANOTHER BEER?
- WE DON'T WORK HERE.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.262
- PATRICK, LET ME GET--
- SHH!

14:22.329 --> 14:25.199
SIR, OF COURSE WE WORK HERE.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.901
WHY ELSE WOULD WE
BE BEHIND THE BAR?

14:27.968 --> 14:31.004
CAN WE GET YOU
A MENU, SIR?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.106
YOU KNOW WE DON'T
ACTUALLY WORK HERE,
RIGHT?

14:33.173 --> 14:36.610
- HERE YOU GO.
- THIS IS SODA.

14:36.677 --> 14:37.978
NO NO,

14:38.045 --> 14:41.114
IT'S A FREE SODA.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.116
IT WON'T BUDGE.
I NEED A SCREWDRIVER.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.352
PATRICK:
<i>IT'S A LITTLE DUSTY,</i>
<i>BUT I FOUND IT.</i>

14:45.419 --> 14:46.787
JO, JO, JO, JO!

14:53.527 --> 14:56.630
OKAY, FUZZY NAVEL.

14:56.697 --> 14:58.699
- PATRICK.
- WHAT?

14:58.765 --> 15:00.601
- THERE'S A RAT.
- WHAT? WHERE?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.936
IT'S OVER THERE!

15:03.003 --> 15:05.539
PATRICK, PLEASE.

15:05.606 --> 15:08.275
GIVE ME YOUR PURSE.
GIVE ME YOUR PURSE.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.043
CHERRIES!

15:10.110 --> 15:12.479
THIS IS A NEW BAG.

15:12.546 --> 15:15.516
I'M SURE OLD NAVY WILL
MAKE MORE OF THEM, JO.
SHH.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.018
I'M SORRY, DUDE.
I DON'T THINK THAT
WAS A RAT.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.221
ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT WAS
JUST A REALLY UGLY BABY

15:21.288 --> 15:23.757
AND, UM,
IT JUST RAN AWAY.

15:23.824 --> 15:26.059
- MY PHONE IS IN--
- SHH!

15:26.126 --> 15:30.063
SO, PATRICK, WHERE I'M FROM,
WE LIKE TO HAVE CHERRIES

15:30.130 --> 15:32.266
WITH OUR FUZZY NAVELS.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.568
HOW ELSE WOULD YOU
MAKE IT ELEGANT?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.238
I AM OUT
OF CHERRIES TOO.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.841
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE--
WELL, THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED.

15:40.908 --> 15:44.545
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
REFILLED THIS THING.
DO YOU MIND IF I--

15:44.611 --> 15:47.147
I MIND IF YOU GET
YOUR JOB TOGETHER, PATRICK.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.683
SERIOUSLY, WHAT KIND OF
BAR ARE YOU RUNNING?

15:49.750 --> 15:52.686
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
- GEORGIA, LET'S GO
AROUND THIS TIME.

15:52.753 --> 15:55.556
I FEEL LIKE THAT GUY SAW
MORE THAN HE SHOULD HAVE
LAST TIME.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.429
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

16:02.496 --> 16:04.198
HOW ARE WE GOING TO
UNSCREW THIS THING?

16:04.264 --> 16:07.601
WITH A SCREWDRIVER
THAT I'LL MAKE WITH
STIRRY THINGS AND TOOTHPICKS

16:07.668 --> 16:09.169
AND A SCREWDRIVER
I FOUND BEHIND THE BAR.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.271
OH SWEET. OKAY.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.608
AND THEN--
( GRUNTS )

16:14.675 --> 16:16.877
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT!

16:16.944 --> 16:18.645
OKAY, HERE, COME ON
AND TAKE IT.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.715
RUN RUN!

16:21.782 --> 16:24.585
WE FORGOT THE WINGS!

16:26.954 --> 16:30.524
WAIT. I THINK WE
SHOULD LEAVE A TIP.

16:30.591 --> 16:32.159
DO YOU HAVE CHANGE
FOR A $20?

16:32.226 --> 16:33.527
HE'S BEEN NICE,
BUT I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A LOT.

16:33.594 --> 16:35.562
REALLY? REALLY, JO?
YOU THINK THAT'S A LOT?

16:35.629 --> 16:39.700
HERE, JUST MAKE IT RAIN.
THERE YOU GO, PATRICK.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.904
YOU MAY BE THE SLOWEST
THIEVES WE'VE EVER HAD.

16:45.873 --> 16:47.908
WE LEFT YOU A TIP.

17:03.257 --> 17:05.259
I'M GONNA NEED
A NEW PASSPORT NOW.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.828
WHO CARRIES AROUND
A PASSPORT?

17:07.895 --> 17:11.131
HOW ELSE AM I GONNA CASH
MY TRAVELERS CHECKS?

17:12.466 --> 17:16.403
LET ME GUESS.
THE DRY-CLEANER SENT YOU.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.738
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

17:17.804 --> 17:19.773
PATRICK KNOWS EVERYTHING.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.442
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
THEY SEE SOMEONE DESPERATE
TO GET IN THE DOOR

17:22.509 --> 17:24.378
AND THEY SEND 'EM OVER HERE
FOR MICKEY'S PICTURE.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.747
THAT'S WHY I KEEP COPIES
IN THE BACK.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.882
YOU HAVE COPIES
IN THE BACK?

17:28.949 --> 17:30.717
YEAH,
A WHOLE STACK OF 'EM.

17:30.784 --> 17:34.354
IF YOU JUST ASKED ME,
I WOULD HAVE SOLD YOU
ONE FOR 10 BUCKS.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.523
JUST CURIOUS.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.992
WOULD YOU HAVE ACCEPTED
A TRAVELERS CHECK?

17:40.761 --> 17:43.063
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

17:43.130 --> 17:46.099
BUT I HAVE $10,000
IN SMALL BILLS,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.468
SOME PLANE TICKETS
AND A CONDOM.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.106
I ALSO HAVE SOME THINGS
THAT<i>YOU</i>MIGHT NEED.

17:55.342 --> 17:58.378
- AUNT HONEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- JO CALLED ME.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.949
I PANICKED. YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT BREAKING
THE RULES. I PANIC.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.350
WHAT DID THEY DO?

18:03.417 --> 18:05.819
AND IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR SHIRT OFF TO EXPLAIN,

18:05.886 --> 18:07.387
IT'S OKAY.

18:08.956 --> 18:11.258
WE'RE ALL GROWNUPS HERE.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.928
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

18:14.995 --> 18:18.799
OCEAN'S TWO HERE WAS JUST
TRYING TO GET INTO THE CLUB
ACROSS THE STREET.

18:18.866 --> 18:21.869
I TOLD YOU GIRLS
NOT TO WORRY ABOUT
GETTING IN THERE.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.904
THAT IS THE HOT
PLACE TO BE.

18:23.971 --> 18:25.806
THOSE PLACES,
THEY COME AND GO.

18:25.873 --> 18:28.809
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO FIND A PLACE WHERE
YOU FEEL GOOD.

18:28.876 --> 18:30.677
<i>THAT'S</i>THE PLACE TO BE.

18:30.744 --> 18:33.280
WHOA WHOA WHOA.

18:33.347 --> 18:35.816
AM I GETTING
THE LOSER SPEECH?

18:37.117 --> 18:38.986
THE ONE THAT I GAVE TO JO
WHEN I GOT INVITED

18:39.052 --> 18:41.588
TO KELLY WEBSTER'S SIXTH
BIRTHDAY PARTY AND SHE DIDN'T?

18:41.655 --> 18:43.757
THE ONE WHERE
YOU LIE AND SAY,

18:43.824 --> 18:45.893
"OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT
MISSING ANYTHING.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.728
YOU'LL HAVE MORE FUN
BY YOURSELF"?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.364
SO KELLY WEBSTER'S
PARTY WAS FUN?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.933
SHE HAD A SLIP 'N SLIDE.

18:54.868 --> 18:58.172
YOUR AUNT'S RIGHT.
I USED TO WORK AT 1104,
AND IT'S PRETTY AWFUL.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.841
IT'S HOT.
IT'S CROWDED.
IT SMELLS LIKE CHEMICALS.

19:00.908 --> 19:04.478
AND EVERYBODY'S JUST PRETENDING
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME 'CAUSE THEY
THINK THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.

19:04.545 --> 19:07.681
SO IT SUCKS
AND I CAN'T GET IN.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.553
INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT
THE HOTTEST PLACE TO BE,

19:12.619 --> 19:15.689
YOU NEED TO FIND A PLACE
WHERE YOU CAN BE THE GIRL
FROM BACK HOME,

19:15.756 --> 19:18.725
THE ONE I KNOW EVERYONE
IS GOING TO LOVE.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.861
BACK HOME I COULD
GET IN ANYWHERE.

19:20.928 --> 19:24.131
I WAS ON EVERY LIST--
"GEORGIA PLUS ANYONE."

19:24.198 --> 19:27.167
I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT.
WITHOUT HER, I WAS NOBODY.

19:27.234 --> 19:30.938
- AND THEN WITH HER,
I WAS "ANYONE."
- SEE?

19:31.004 --> 19:33.774
AND WHEN YOU WERE BACK HOME
BEING SO POPULAR,

19:33.841 --> 19:36.343
WERE YOU JUMPING AROUND BARS
MAKING A RUCKUS?

19:36.410 --> 19:37.611
TAKING ALL MY CHERRIES.

19:37.678 --> 19:41.515
OH, YOU DON'T TAKE
A MAN'S CHERRIES.

19:41.582 --> 19:43.550
AND YOU DON'T PULL
A LADY OUT OF HER BATH.

19:43.617 --> 19:44.985
I HAD COMPANY.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.962
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

20:00.067 --> 20:01.735
YOU CANNOT STAY HERE.

20:01.802 --> 20:04.171
WHO'S OVER THERE?

20:04.238 --> 20:05.539
NOBODY.

20:05.606 --> 20:06.907
THEN WHY
AREN'T YOU IN IT?

20:06.974 --> 20:08.442
'CAUSE THEY TOLD ME
TO BE HERE.

20:08.509 --> 20:10.711
WELL, I WAS TOLD
TO BE IN THAT CLUB.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.181
NO, YOU WEREN'T.

20:14.248 --> 20:17.751
THE POINT IS I REALIZED
I CAN BE HAPPIER SOMEWHERE
ELSE AND SO CAN YOU.

20:17.818 --> 20:20.454
SO TAKE THAT OVER THERE.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.769
WOW.

20:35.836 --> 20:38.805
WHAT A RUSH.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.708
SEE?
AND NOBODY EVEN CARES.

20:41.775 --> 20:45.312
I'M TELLING!
I AM SO TELLING.

20:45.379 --> 20:47.147
- I'M GONNA GO BACK.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

20:47.214 --> 20:50.117
- NO, I'M NOT.
- YOU ARE BREAKING
THE RULES.

20:50.184 --> 20:52.819
AND WITHOUT RULES,
ORDER BECOMES CHAOS,

20:52.886 --> 20:55.355
AND THAT IS WHEN THE MACHINES
MAKE THEIR MOVE.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.725
ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA RAT HER OUT?

20:58.792 --> 21:02.563
AND ENJOY EVERY
MINUTE OF IT.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.599
HEY, JO, REMEMBER THAT THING
THAT WE DID TO KELLY WEBSTER

21:05.666 --> 21:08.068
WHEN SHE DIDN'T INVITE<i>YOU</i>
TO HER BIRTHDAY
THE NEXT YEAR?

21:12.873 --> 21:14.107
I LIKE THAT.

21:14.174 --> 21:16.510
I'M STILL GOING TO TELL.

21:16.577 --> 21:17.811
<i>( METALLIC CLANGS )</i>

21:17.878 --> 21:20.647
OR MAYBE I WON'T.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.716
( AIR WHOOSHING )

21:22.783 --> 21:24.484
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU!
