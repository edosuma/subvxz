WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:02.343
<i>Back in the '80s, America got in shape,</i>

00:02.382 --> 00:04.278
<i>and that meant getting fit
and eating right.</i>

00:04.346 --> 00:06.984
<i>So every chef started
becoming health-conscious,</i>

00:07.055 --> 00:09.125
<i>except Chef Beverly Goldberg.</i>

00:09.195 --> 00:13.219
For my growing schmoopaloo,
my famous lasagna burger bomb.

00:13.297 --> 00:14.962
Wow! I can't believe
no one's ever thought

00:14.997 --> 00:16.273
to use lasagna as a bun before.

00:16.352 --> 00:18.766
<i>She was always inventing
new caloric cuisine.</i>

00:18.844 --> 00:21.750
For Pops, my triple-meat ziti surprise.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.237
And the surprise is,

00:23.305 --> 00:26.240
the lamb really brings out
the beef and chicken.

00:26.308 --> 00:28.376
<i>But that was nothing compared
to what she made my dad.</i>

00:28.438 --> 00:31.106
And for my handsome man of the house,

00:31.174 --> 00:33.943
salad made just the way you like it...

00:34.010 --> 00:37.112
A deli tray of cold cuts
and cheeses, zero veggies,

00:37.180 --> 00:39.248
served in a bowl of buttermilk ranch.

00:39.282 --> 00:41.450
You see? Salads don't have to be boring.

00:41.518 --> 00:44.286
That is, by definition, not a salad.
Words have meaning!

00:44.354 --> 00:46.121
<i>Yeah, my mom's cookbook
chronicled some of</i>

00:46.189 --> 00:48.057
<i>the least-healthy recipes known to man.</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:50.092
<i>Strangely, no publishers wanted it.</i>

00:50.126 --> 00:53.095
These rejection letters
are so hurtful and specific.

00:53.129 --> 00:56.732
"A dietary Vietnam"? "Pure poison"?

00:56.766 --> 00:59.401
"A culinary kick to the crotch!"

00:59.436 --> 01:02.222
On the bright side, getting mail is fun.

01:02.285 --> 01:04.144
And these are from the crappy,
independent publishers

01:04.199 --> 01:06.308
that make nonsense like textbooks

01:06.376 --> 01:08.004
and Bibles for children.

01:08.081 --> 01:10.835
<i>Still, all those "no" s
didn't diminish her love of cooking.</i>

01:10.889 --> 01:12.481
<i>Or our love of eating.</i>

01:12.549 --> 01:15.784
And save room for dessert,
'cause Mama made her signature

01:15.819 --> 01:18.287
upside-down chocolate
peanut butter cheesecake.

01:18.321 --> 01:20.256
There's no top or bottom to it,

01:20.290 --> 01:22.291
so I'm just going right for the middle.

01:22.325 --> 01:23.626
You know, Dave Kim's family

01:23.660 --> 01:25.294
all go for a walk after dinner.

01:25.328 --> 01:27.496
If you can walk afterwards,
you're doing it wrong.

01:28.565 --> 01:30.099
Talk fast,

01:30.133 --> 01:32.021
I got a flip-flopped cake coming my way.

01:32.435 --> 01:34.336
Cookbook publisher?

01:34.404 --> 01:36.672
We don't need any books!
We're a TV household!

01:36.740 --> 01:38.274
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:38.308 --> 01:39.908
Hi. It's Beverly Goldberg.

01:39.943 --> 01:42.617
Harrison Whitby
of Whitby and Sons Publishing.

01:42.688 --> 01:43.946
No relation.

01:43.980 --> 01:45.820
I'm calling about your cookbook.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.117
Everybody shut up right now.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.085
But nobody's saying anything.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.787
I will drown you in that damn cake

01:51.821 --> 01:53.367
if you don't shut your dumb, fat mouth!

01:54.591 --> 01:56.077
How can I help you, Mr. Whitby?

01:56.156 --> 01:57.926
I think I can help you.

01:57.961 --> 01:59.928
You see, every cookbook
that comes across my desk

01:59.963 --> 02:02.531
is low-fat this, no-sugar that.

02:02.599 --> 02:03.932
But yours...

02:03.967 --> 02:06.435
Yours is not concerned
with health in any way.

02:06.469 --> 02:07.770
Well, that's because I disregard

02:07.804 --> 02:09.538
the most basic dietary guidelines.

02:09.606 --> 02:12.478
And that's exactly why
I want to publish it.

02:12.564 --> 02:15.678
Holy [bleep],
Holy [bleep], Holy [bleep].

02:15.712 --> 02:16.945
That's nice news.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.981
I just need a little rewrite.

02:19.015 --> 02:22.351
You want me to add more lard,
butter, and salt to the recipes?

02:22.385 --> 02:24.390
Uh, it'll kill people, but I'll do it.

02:24.453 --> 02:27.389
No. I just need the stories
behind the recipes.

02:27.457 --> 02:29.625
Tell me where they came from.
Make it personal.

02:29.659 --> 02:30.893
Oh, I can do that.

02:30.960 --> 02:31.994
People are always telling me,

02:32.028 --> 02:33.962
"I know way too much about you!"

02:33.997 --> 02:35.998
Beautiful. No rush.

02:36.032 --> 02:37.664
Just get it to me in 48 hours.

02:38.735 --> 02:40.903
- Bevy, who was that?
- Destiny.

02:40.970 --> 02:42.664
How the hell did she get this number?

02:42.727 --> 02:44.473
They're gonna publish my cookbook!

02:44.507 --> 02:45.808
Oh, how about that?

02:45.842 --> 02:47.576
Anything is possible!

02:47.644 --> 02:49.511
I deserve everything
that's coming to me.

02:49.546 --> 02:50.979
You really do, Bevy.

02:51.014 --> 02:53.415
I'll make sure to save a spot
on my bookshelf.

02:53.483 --> 02:55.751
Ooh, that's a good idea.
I need to make some room, too.

02:55.819 --> 02:57.820
I'm an author!

03:12.869 --> 03:14.770
<i>Barry and Erica were college roommates,</i>

03:14.838 --> 03:16.538
<i>and it was amazing...</i>

03:16.573 --> 03:18.073
<i>How little they got along.</i>

03:18.108 --> 03:20.442
You are an idiot!
And I'm talking medically.

03:20.510 --> 03:23.212
How dare you? I'm pre-med.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.913
I'd be the first to know
if I was an idiot.

03:24.948 --> 03:26.382
Then where are the car keys?

03:26.416 --> 03:27.916
'Cause they're supposed to be
on that hook right there.

03:27.951 --> 03:30.252
Oh, you mean my back-scratchin' hook?

03:30.286 --> 03:32.588
Works better when the keys
don't rip up my shoulder meat.

03:34.023 --> 03:35.524
There you go.

03:35.558 --> 03:37.821
You did it, Hooky. You did it.

03:37.899 --> 03:40.305
<i>Yep, they'd lived
together their whole lives,</i>

03:40.368 --> 03:42.969
<i>but sharing a dorm room
was a whole different story.</i>

03:43.024 --> 03:44.466
Did you eat my ramen?

03:44.534 --> 03:46.068
Yeah. I didn't want to walk to the caf,

03:46.102 --> 03:47.603
so I snagged one of your
hot and spicy beefs.

03:47.637 --> 03:49.805
But that's my feast from the East!

03:49.873 --> 03:51.707
And you should probably know that I also

03:51.741 --> 03:52.908
drained your last Mountain Dew.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.576
My morning Dew?

03:54.611 --> 03:56.044
That's how I rev up for the day!

03:56.079 --> 03:58.947
Do you have any respect
for society's norms?

03:58.982 --> 04:01.717
<i>Somehow they'd managed to keep
it civil the whole semester...</i>

04:01.751 --> 04:03.285
<i>Until one fateful night.</i>

04:03.319 --> 04:04.987
Oh, my God, Big Tasty!

04:05.054 --> 04:07.389
You're destroying the world
record in 110-meter hurdles!

04:07.424 --> 04:09.291
He's the Carl Lewis of
pressing red and blue buttons

04:09.325 --> 04:10.659
- with his feet!
- It's happening!

04:10.727 --> 04:13.662
Big Tasty's gonna finally
take the gol... No!

04:13.730 --> 04:15.564
Oopsy, was this thing connected to that?

04:15.598 --> 04:16.798
My bad. Get out.

04:16.833 --> 04:18.267
- Yeah, okay.
- Sorry.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.803
Whoa! JTP, you do not
have to listen to her.

04:20.837 --> 04:22.604
Actually, Tasty, we do.

04:22.639 --> 04:24.006
It's the law of older siblings...

04:24.073 --> 04:25.340
They get the final say on everything.

04:25.408 --> 04:26.642
That's not a law.

04:26.676 --> 04:27.843
I would know.

04:27.911 --> 04:29.778
- Could've been the son of a lawyer.
- It is.

04:29.813 --> 04:32.080
Thanks to my older bro,
I'm always the one who dealt it,

04:32.115 --> 04:33.282
regardless of who smelt it.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.317
And my older sister
decided to take my room.

04:35.351 --> 04:37.119
So now I sleep on the couch.

04:37.153 --> 04:38.153
Why not take her old room?

04:38.188 --> 04:39.521
And have her take it back?

04:39.589 --> 04:41.423
No. I'm not jumping on that carousel.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.759
My sister gets priority on all
my mom's love and affection.

04:43.793 --> 04:46.361
No one cares about your tragic
home life, Matt Bradley.

04:46.429 --> 04:48.464
I want to run on a plastic mat!

04:48.498 --> 04:49.765
Well, we all have stories.

04:49.799 --> 04:50.799
I'll get the door for you.

04:50.834 --> 04:52.668
JTP, I demand you stay.

04:52.702 --> 04:54.603
- Sorry, Tasty.
- Big sis rules.

04:54.637 --> 04:56.192
Behind this smile is pain.

04:57.184 --> 04:58.774
Don't worry, Bar. I'm staying.

04:58.808 --> 05:00.008
A man of courage.

05:00.043 --> 05:02.177
Oh, you misread that.
I-I'm not here for you.

05:02.212 --> 05:04.114
I-I get to stay because
it's Erica's will.

05:04.177 --> 05:05.647
This is not fair!

05:05.682 --> 05:07.015
We're both freshmen!

05:07.050 --> 05:08.317
We're technically equals!

05:08.351 --> 05:09.651
He does have a point, angelface.

05:09.686 --> 05:11.653
Whoa, whoa, whose side
are you on, Schwartz?

05:11.688 --> 05:13.956
Sorry, Big Tasty. Erica's threatening
tone was new information.

05:13.990 --> 05:16.692
Geoffrey "Mad Man" Schwartz,

05:16.726 --> 05:18.544
how many times have I saved your life?

05:18.618 --> 05:20.075
- None?
- I would've if you weren't

05:20.146 --> 05:22.006
so boring and risk-averse.

05:22.031 --> 05:23.799
I'm not comfortable being
in the middle of this.

05:23.833 --> 05:26.034
You will be in the middle of this.
It's decided.

05:26.069 --> 05:28.704
As a neutral third party,
you will establish

05:28.738 --> 05:31.139
a system of rules to stop
our petty squabbling.

05:31.174 --> 05:32.679
That sounds like a nightmare!

05:32.749 --> 05:35.077
I'm good with it. But just
remember who hugs and kisses you.

05:35.144 --> 05:36.578
Oh, well, there's plenty
of that to go around.

05:36.646 --> 05:37.813
Come on!

05:37.847 --> 05:39.848
Get in there. Come on.

05:39.883 --> 05:43.363
Doing all the work. Come on. My guy.

05:43.441 --> 05:45.566
<i>As Geoff was caught
in the middle of Barry and Erica,</i>

05:45.644 --> 05:47.723
<i>my mom was at the end
of her big rewrite.</i>

05:47.757 --> 05:50.808
Schmoo, feast your delicious boy eyes

05:50.871 --> 05:54.456
on 400 pages of scrumptious
family history.

05:54.527 --> 05:56.527
Wow, this has...

05:56.581 --> 05:59.034
So many words.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.169
Most not about food.

06:01.204 --> 06:02.671
And who is that sturdy fella?

06:02.705 --> 06:04.206
That's your great-aunt Esther.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.607
Why two eye patches?

06:05.675 --> 06:06.883
This is a funny story.

06:06.961 --> 06:09.696
Uh, she was dragged by a
horse through the town.

06:09.758 --> 06:10.813
That is funny.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.172
Until the reins finally got stuck

06:13.243 --> 06:15.704
in a tree branch, and the
horse fell on top of her.

06:16.853 --> 06:18.086
So, of course, they shot it.

06:18.121 --> 06:20.422
And why would you put that
in a book about food?

06:20.456 --> 06:23.125
Because the next day, she
made a delicious horse stew.

06:23.192 --> 06:25.961
I changed it to lamb because
some people can be stuffy.

06:26.029 --> 06:28.597
And she must've had to make
a lot since she had 14 kids.

06:28.631 --> 06:31.567
No, no. As I indicated here
next to the ingredients,

06:31.601 --> 06:33.153
uh, only six of them lived.

06:33.216 --> 06:37.072
Disease, war, winter, famine.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.041
Seven of them were just
stomped to death.

06:39.075 --> 06:42.377
And you put that right here
in a book about food.

06:42.412 --> 06:45.047
So, you clearly know what you're doing.

06:45.081 --> 06:46.648
Would you mind reading the whole thing,

06:46.716 --> 06:48.317
and telling me what you think
before I send it in?

06:48.384 --> 06:49.484
I think I get it.

06:49.552 --> 06:51.219
A horse drags a lady,

06:51.254 --> 06:54.400
pancake dippers, a cousin gets stomped.

06:54.462 --> 06:55.697
You got yourself a winner, lady.

06:55.775 --> 06:58.267
This is the only publisher
who's shown any interest,

06:58.322 --> 07:00.562
and if he doesn't like it,
I don't know what I'll do.

07:00.597 --> 07:02.297
I guess I could...

07:02.332 --> 07:03.615
Thank you.

07:03.686 --> 07:05.662
<i>While I was dragged like Aunt Esther</i>

07:05.732 --> 07:07.069
<i>into reading my mom's cookbook,</i>

07:07.103 --> 07:09.137
<i>Geoff was pulled
between Barry and Erica.</i>

07:09.172 --> 07:10.787
Okay, so you're both holding the binders

07:10.849 --> 07:12.180
that I stayed up all night creating

07:12.258 --> 07:14.776
with the guidelines in order to
keep this room safe and fun.

07:14.811 --> 07:16.813
These are so stupid.
And I want the blue one.

07:16.867 --> 07:19.581
You'll find it details solutions
to all of your living issues.

07:19.626 --> 07:21.085
Oh, so many words and tabs!

07:21.148 --> 07:23.785
Just tell your loudmouth
girlfriend to stop being so bossy.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.621
I will punch your head while you sleep.

07:25.655 --> 07:28.290
Joke's on you. My skull is crazy-jacked.

07:28.324 --> 07:30.993
Guys, no punching...
Asleep or otherwise.

07:31.027 --> 07:33.629
In here, you'll find clear instructions
on how to share everything.

07:33.663 --> 07:35.797
- Like the mini-fridge.
- No way.

07:35.832 --> 07:38.266
I promised my perishables a safe haven.

07:38.301 --> 07:39.668
You put your sheets in there.

07:39.702 --> 07:40.969
You know I run hot!

07:41.004 --> 07:43.105
It's the dead of winter, barfbag!

07:43.139 --> 07:44.640
You should really get
your circulation checked.

07:44.674 --> 07:45.807
Already did.

07:45.842 --> 07:46.996
It's a trouble area, like you.

07:47.058 --> 07:49.714
Enough. Consult your binders.
I'm not your referee.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.113
Wait, that's it.

07:51.147 --> 07:53.949
You're our referee... Our Geoff-er-ee.

07:53.993 --> 07:56.080
It works 'cause it's your name
and also your new job.

07:56.151 --> 07:58.186
I'm not staying here full-time
to mediate every fight,

07:58.221 --> 07:59.463
conflict, or disagreement.

07:59.502 --> 08:01.377
It would work better than
these crappy binders.

08:01.402 --> 08:02.383
Yeah. Swing and a miss, hon.

08:02.408 --> 08:03.692
You didn't even open them.

08:03.726 --> 08:05.694
We've moved on from
your embarrassing binders.

08:05.728 --> 08:07.195
- You should, too.
- You know us.

08:07.230 --> 08:08.830
We can't be trusted to follow the rules.

08:08.865 --> 08:10.499
And every moment
is touch-and-go with me.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.867
And I'm no day at the beach, either.

08:11.901 --> 08:13.502
I-I know I don't have a lot going on...

08:13.536 --> 08:14.866
- Like nothing.
- I'm secretly worried.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.194
Then it's settled.

08:16.279 --> 08:18.554
Geoffrey will be the arbiter
of everything that happens

08:18.616 --> 08:19.912
within these seven walls.

08:19.976 --> 08:21.768
- Seven?
- And it starts now!

08:21.869 --> 08:24.747
Excuse me while I clip my angry,
jagged toenails on Erica's bed.

08:24.802 --> 08:26.214
Geoff-er-ee?

08:26.249 --> 08:27.883
Bar, maybe that's a bathroom task?

08:27.917 --> 08:29.885
Hmm. That's an interesting fix.

08:29.919 --> 08:31.364
Thanks, Geoff-er-ee.

08:33.523 --> 08:36.158
Wow. You are really making up
for that binder fiasco.

08:36.192 --> 08:37.759
<i>As Geoff was playing referee,</i>

08:37.827 --> 08:39.594
<i>I was looking for some coaching</i>

08:39.662 --> 08:41.429
<i>on how to deal with my mom's cookbook.</i>

08:41.496 --> 08:43.440
Dude, your mom's book is a horror show!

08:43.465 --> 08:44.499
I know, Dave Kim.

08:44.534 --> 08:47.069
So much tragedy has
befallen your people.

08:47.103 --> 08:49.877
I can't un-read these things, man!
I'm different now.

08:49.932 --> 08:51.173
I know, Dave Kim.

08:51.207 --> 08:52.908
How are you gonna tell her
she can't submit this?

08:52.942 --> 08:54.443
I don't know, Dave Kim!

08:54.510 --> 08:56.278
I just need to find some way
to break it to her

08:56.345 --> 08:58.680
so she doesn't hate me
when I destroy her dream!

08:58.715 --> 09:01.017
<i>Yep, I had no idea what I'd tell my mom,</i>

09:01.087 --> 09:04.619
<i>until I saw Doc Katman give
a master class in bad news.</i>

09:04.681 --> 09:08.924
Johnny, I just want to say
Rush rules, and so do you.

09:08.958 --> 09:10.792
True, and true.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.027
You're a good dude, dude.

09:12.061 --> 09:13.595
So are you, Johnny.

09:13.629 --> 09:15.897
But that said, you haven't turned in

09:15.932 --> 09:18.140
one assignment all semester, so...

09:18.801 --> 09:20.469
You're going to flunk again.

09:20.536 --> 09:22.471
Oh, no! The wind's out of my sails!

09:22.538 --> 09:25.607
Luckily, you're a badass,
so you can take it.

09:25.641 --> 09:28.043
Whoa. You just devastated
me with your words,

09:28.077 --> 09:29.211
but I feel great about it!

09:29.245 --> 09:30.712
Thanks, Doc Whoever-You-Are!

09:30.747 --> 09:32.447
- Hmm.
- Doc, I don't get it.

09:32.482 --> 09:34.483
You gave Johnny Atkins
life-destroying news,

09:34.550 --> 09:36.151
and he thanked you for it. How?

09:36.219 --> 09:38.453
It's all about the compliment sandwich.

09:38.488 --> 09:40.288
Compliment sandwich?

09:40.323 --> 09:43.725
You simply wedge your
criticism, AKA the meat,

09:43.760 --> 09:46.762
in between two compliments,
AKA the bread.

09:46.796 --> 09:48.604
<i>Yes! That was the answer!</i>

09:48.666 --> 09:50.908
<i>Now, I just had to make my
mom a compliment sandwich.</i>

09:50.963 --> 09:53.135
- There he is!
- Gah!

09:53.169 --> 09:54.736
Were you just waiting
for me at the door?

09:54.771 --> 09:56.238
Well, yes, but only for hours.

09:56.272 --> 09:58.440
Now, tell me, tell me, tell me
how much you loved it.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.035
I'll start you off.

10:00.109 --> 10:01.230
"It was perfect."

10:01.277 --> 10:04.340
I-I hear people saying that...
Like you, right now.

10:05.395 --> 10:07.649
And I also want to add...
You did it, girl.

10:07.683 --> 10:10.352
Yeah, well, what
about my writing, my stories?

10:10.419 --> 10:11.753
Were they everything
you thought, and more?

10:11.788 --> 10:13.488
Oh, so much more.

10:13.523 --> 10:15.731
- You did it, girl!
- You said that already. Get to it.

10:15.809 --> 10:18.093
<i>Well, I had given
her the top slice of bread.</i>

10:18.127 --> 10:19.466
<i>I guess it was time for the meat.</i>

10:19.513 --> 10:22.153
I hated it hard. Change every word.

10:22.216 --> 10:23.799
Excuse me?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.200
But wait, before you get upset...

10:27.370 --> 10:28.470
You did it, girl.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.838
What are you saying to me?

10:29.872 --> 10:31.606
Oh, balls! My sandwich sucked!

10:31.641 --> 10:33.975
I cooked you in my lady kitchen.

10:34.010 --> 10:37.045
You were my greatest dish,
and this is how you treat me?

10:37.113 --> 10:38.980
I wasn't really thinking
about your lady kitchen

10:39.015 --> 10:40.649
when I was reading your lousy book.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.951
Gasp of gasps!

10:42.985 --> 10:45.287
I have clearly failed as a mother!

10:45.321 --> 10:47.178
And as a cookbook author.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.749
I just want you to know
that what you have done to me

10:48.795 --> 10:50.240
is worse than any horse stomp.

10:50.288 --> 10:52.789
Because I still have eyes to see

10:52.818 --> 10:54.696
how my beautiful boy betrayed me.

10:54.730 --> 10:56.331
<i>She hated the sandwich,</i>

10:56.365 --> 10:57.631
<i>so I tried one more slice of bread.</i>

10:57.678 --> 11:00.650
But... you did it, girl?

11:01.322 --> 11:04.064
<i>Barry and Erica had a new tool
to help them coexist.</i>

11:04.135 --> 11:05.802
Moron, where are the car keys?

11:05.870 --> 11:07.064
<i>And that tool was Geoff.</i>

11:07.095 --> 11:09.291
They're right here.
Erica, I made you your own set.

11:09.361 --> 11:12.309
And, Barry, I attached your keys
to this cumbersome hunk of wood

11:12.377 --> 11:13.478
that I painted in Flyers colors.

11:13.533 --> 11:14.819
Sick!

11:14.879 --> 11:16.613
It's like an orange nunchuck
that starts my car.

11:16.658 --> 11:18.541
Whoa. You're killing it, Geoff-er-ee.

11:18.580 --> 11:20.617
<i>Yep, having a
Geoff-er-ee fixed everything...</i>

11:20.652 --> 11:22.027
<i>Until three hours later.</i>

11:22.090 --> 11:23.387
- Ooh!
- Oh!

11:23.421 --> 11:24.721
- What the hell?
- Yeah.

11:24.756 --> 11:25.775
Why are they here?

11:25.838 --> 11:27.938
'Cause our Geoff-er-ee ruled
that it was my JTP night.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.383
But why did he allow you to throw
deadly lawn darts in the wall?

11:31.422 --> 11:32.763
The lawn darts
were actually a compromise.

11:32.797 --> 11:34.298
We started with a fireman's axe.

11:34.332 --> 11:35.500
There's one on every floor.

11:35.539 --> 11:37.501
Whatever. Everyone leave.
It's after midnight.

11:37.569 --> 11:39.736
Nuh-uh! Night only starts when I sleep.

11:39.771 --> 11:41.171
Geoff-er-ee, you're
supposed to be preventing

11:41.239 --> 11:42.639
this kind of stupidity.

11:42.674 --> 11:45.242
Sure, it's my fault for not
clearly defining day and night.

11:45.276 --> 11:47.144
Actually, I need to be
at the Gap early anyway

11:47.178 --> 11:48.371
to add a new level to the jean wall.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.793
And if I don't get 12 to 14 hours
of shut-eye, I am a wreck.

11:51.860 --> 11:53.767
I think you're struggling with
seasonal depression, bro.

11:53.801 --> 11:55.736
- For sure.
- Now everyone shut up.

11:55.770 --> 11:57.771
You're not going anywhere
till you see Mr. Sun.

11:57.805 --> 11:59.873
Fine. You want the room?
Then I get the car tomorrow.

11:59.908 --> 12:02.142
What? It's my car day!

12:02.210 --> 12:04.945
I was gonna do fishtails
in the ShopRite parking lot!

12:04.979 --> 12:06.380
Geoff-er-ee, throw a flag.

12:06.414 --> 12:08.415
Again, my fault for assuming
you two would demonstrate

12:08.449 --> 12:10.050
the most basic courtesy to each other.

12:10.084 --> 12:11.285
Fine! Take the car.

12:11.319 --> 12:12.920
I'm taking the computer.

12:12.954 --> 12:14.621
Uh-uh! I have a paper due tomorrow!

12:14.656 --> 12:16.156
That you're gonna have to write by hand.

12:16.224 --> 12:18.325
No! Geoff, do something.

12:18.393 --> 12:21.094
Bar, the computer's supposed
to be for doing actual work,

12:21.129 --> 12:22.629
not to hug vindictively

12:22.664 --> 12:24.131
so as to prevent someone
else from using it.

12:24.165 --> 12:25.732
Well, you never specified that.

12:25.767 --> 12:28.835
He got me. I never explicitly
said "no computer cuddling."

12:28.903 --> 12:30.635
Gah! I'll be at the stupid library!

12:34.108 --> 12:36.176
She walked out, and you almost died.

12:36.244 --> 12:37.728
It's probably good
we didn't use the axe.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.500
<i>While Barry and Erica
were pushing Geoff to his limits,</i>

12:40.570 --> 12:43.650
<i>there was no limit to how pushy
my mom could be about her book.</i>

12:43.685 --> 12:45.852
Hey! We're watching The Equalizer.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.789
Now we'll never know
if things were equalized!

12:48.823 --> 12:52.002
After receiving mixed reviews
on my masterwork,

12:52.072 --> 12:55.429
which I took graciously,
I am now seeking feedback

12:55.463 --> 12:58.322
that's not the demented ramblings
of a jealous teenager.

12:58.377 --> 12:59.666
Yeah, good stuff.

12:59.701 --> 13:01.168
If you could just shimmy
to the left a little,

13:01.202 --> 13:02.936
then the remote can do what it does.

13:02.971 --> 13:04.671
I need you to read it
and tell me what you think.

13:04.706 --> 13:06.039
Why us?

13:06.107 --> 13:08.775
Well, you're my father,
and you'd never lie to me.

13:08.810 --> 13:10.611
And Murray will give me
an honest opinion

13:10.645 --> 13:13.513
'cause he lacks the filter
necessary for polite society.

13:13.548 --> 13:15.349
You make a fair point.

13:15.383 --> 13:17.684
We'll read your overwhelming book.

13:17.719 --> 13:19.286
<i>And read they did...</i>

13:19.320 --> 13:21.221
<i>Page after page of dour tales</i>

13:21.289 --> 13:22.956
<i>and unappetizing family history.</i>

13:22.991 --> 13:25.525
<i>My mom couldn't wait to hear
what they had to say.</i>

13:25.560 --> 13:27.661
Stunned silence is always a good sign.

13:27.695 --> 13:29.696
But I need to hear
how much you liked it.

13:29.731 --> 13:31.398
I liked the part where it ended.

13:31.466 --> 13:34.034
Oh, poo, you're just
being an old grump. Dad?

13:34.068 --> 13:36.970
There's no place for an amputation story

13:37.005 --> 13:38.572
in a chicken piccata recipe.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.040
Oh, no. Was Adam right?

13:40.074 --> 13:41.742
Maybe he's not a teenage butt stain.

13:41.809 --> 13:43.210
That sounds right.

13:43.244 --> 13:44.710
Now, if you just scooch to your left

13:44.734 --> 13:47.132
and then crouch down really tiny,
we're back in business.

13:47.194 --> 13:50.150
<i>My mom finally got
that her cookbook wasn't great,</i>

13:50.184 --> 13:52.185
<i>so she brought me an apology that was.</i>

13:52.220 --> 13:55.389
Schmoopy, I made your favorite...

13:55.423 --> 13:57.758
Ooey-gooey marshmallow cookie bars.

13:57.825 --> 14:00.761
Wait, you made me
cookie bars after I told you

14:00.828 --> 14:02.896
your life's work
was a smelly garbage fire?

14:02.930 --> 14:05.170
- You never said those words.
- Out loud.

14:06.420 --> 14:10.237
Well, it has come to my
attention that you may be right.

14:10.271 --> 14:13.407
My cookbook might be
a tad heavy on death,

14:13.441 --> 14:15.609
despair, and religious persecution.

14:15.677 --> 14:17.711
And there was more animal
violence than I expected.

14:17.745 --> 14:19.546
It's just my publisher really wanted me

14:19.580 --> 14:21.548
to lean into the history of my food,

14:21.582 --> 14:24.685
but that history is pretty damn dark.

14:24.719 --> 14:27.254
But this cookie doesn't have
a dark history to me.

14:27.288 --> 14:28.755
Every time I felt down,

14:28.790 --> 14:31.131
you'd make me a pan of these,
and I always felt better.

14:31.194 --> 14:32.259
You did?

14:32.293 --> 14:34.194
And I think that's what
your publisher wants...

14:34.228 --> 14:35.796
Stories about this family.

14:35.863 --> 14:38.598
And no matter what our day
is like, when you cook,

14:38.633 --> 14:41.902
we always find happiness on
our plates and in our hearts.

14:41.936 --> 14:43.904
Write that!

14:43.938 --> 14:45.605
Write that. Write that.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.240
Aah, write it!

14:47.275 --> 14:49.609
No way! I wouldn't know the first
thing about writing a cookbook.

14:49.644 --> 14:50.944
You're so good at putting emotion

14:50.978 --> 14:52.939
into your movies. Just do that.

14:52.986 --> 14:57.918
I suppose I do know how to tug at
the heartstrings in many mediums.

14:57.952 --> 14:59.286
Do your thing. Tug away.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.488
And it has to be done
by tomorrow at 8:00.

15:01.556 --> 15:03.757
<i>While I got roped
into being my mom's ghost writer,</i>

15:03.791 --> 15:05.776
<i>Barry and Erica had written
some new rules of their own.</i>

15:05.816 --> 15:06.869
Whoa!

15:06.909 --> 15:10.497
Behold, Geoffrey,
our elegant tape solution.

15:10.565 --> 15:12.332
We had to take matters
into our own hands

15:12.400 --> 15:14.448
because you failed miserably
as a Geoff-er-ee.

15:14.510 --> 15:17.604
So, you split the room with masking
tape, like on <i>I Love Lucy.</i>

15:17.667 --> 15:20.774
And super smart shows like
<i>Brady Bunch and The Munsters.</i>

15:20.808 --> 15:23.028
One teeny problem...
The door's on Erica's side.

15:23.075 --> 15:24.778
By choice, bro!

15:24.812 --> 15:27.247
I'll use my ninja skills
to scale the building

15:27.281 --> 15:28.747
and enter through a window.

15:28.794 --> 15:31.660
And after he falls and dislocates
his head, the room will be mine.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.788
See, Geoffrey, we didn't need
you or your pathetic binders.

15:34.822 --> 15:37.290
We just needed a roll of this.

15:37.325 --> 15:39.593
Check it. I'm Erica.

15:39.627 --> 15:41.762
I will put that over your
mouth while you sleep.

15:41.796 --> 15:43.163
Then my ghost will haunt you

15:43.197 --> 15:44.965
by farting directly into your pillow,

15:44.999 --> 15:46.867
much like I do in
the realm of the living.

15:46.934 --> 15:48.869
What? I hate you!

15:48.936 --> 15:50.103
She's hitting me, Geoff!

15:50.138 --> 15:51.505
Stay over there! Do something!

15:51.539 --> 15:53.173
- This is all your fault, Geoff!
- Enough!

15:53.207 --> 15:55.342
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

15:55.376 --> 15:57.110
I get it. You're siblings.

15:57.145 --> 15:58.845
You're not meant to be
college roommates.

15:58.872 --> 16:00.737
But what's worse than
the way you treat each other

16:00.791 --> 16:01.878
is how you treat me.

16:02.338 --> 16:05.051
Let that stupid tape solve all
your problems from now on.

16:05.119 --> 16:06.553
I'm done.

16:06.621 --> 16:07.971
<i>As Geoff laid down the law,</i>

16:08.049 --> 16:10.690
<i>the verdict was in on my
draft of my mom's cookbook.</i>

16:10.725 --> 16:13.026
- I love it.
- Oh, I knew it!

16:13.060 --> 16:15.228
Beverly Goldberg is gonna
be a household name.

16:15.296 --> 16:16.504
Beverly Goldberg?

16:16.551 --> 16:17.831
Oh, no, I'm reading the wrong book.

16:17.865 --> 16:19.715
Oh, your book. Your book is crap.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.737
What? But I took out all the
blood and historical tragedy!

16:23.805 --> 16:25.338
I don't know what that means.

16:25.373 --> 16:27.507
But this right here
feels like it was written

16:27.542 --> 16:29.977
by a sappy, sheltered simpleton.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.805
Ouch. Kind of harsh.

16:31.870 --> 16:33.180
Okay, who are you?

16:33.250 --> 16:37.684
Her hyper-sensitive son
who takes her setbacks personally.

16:37.718 --> 16:38.752
What was wrong with it?

16:38.820 --> 16:40.020
It's a schmaltz fest!

16:40.054 --> 16:42.989
Every word is sappy and cloying.

16:43.024 --> 16:44.928
And why do all the recipes
end with a hug?

16:44.967 --> 16:48.232
'Cause it's the obvious emotional
resolution the audience is craving.

16:48.303 --> 16:50.389
Damn it, why didn't I stay
with the ethnic-cleansing,

16:50.450 --> 16:51.794
horse-stompings version?

16:51.810 --> 16:53.500
Because that sounds God-awful, too?

16:53.534 --> 16:54.835
Well, what am I supposed to do?

16:54.869 --> 16:57.404
Do better! You've got 48 hours.

16:57.438 --> 16:59.539
You want me to rewrite that whole thing?

16:59.574 --> 17:01.541
And why 48 hours?

17:01.576 --> 17:03.543
To whip you into a frenzy.

17:03.578 --> 17:06.079
All the best work comes from terror.

17:06.113 --> 17:07.214
Have fun, now.

17:07.248 --> 17:09.249
Mama, I'm so sorry.

17:09.282 --> 17:10.684
I guess I went a little
heavy on the hugs.

17:10.718 --> 17:12.085
You were just trying to help.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.054
I know 48 hours isn't long,

17:14.088 --> 17:15.955
but Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte

17:16.022 --> 17:18.023
did a ton of damage in
that time, and so will we.

17:18.059 --> 17:20.869
- Adam, it's over.
- Why?

17:20.932 --> 17:22.596
I always say
"I could have been a lawyer.

17:22.630 --> 17:23.930
"I could have been an author."

17:23.964 --> 17:26.540
But now, I know for sure...

17:26.634 --> 17:28.213
I'm nothing.

17:31.857 --> 17:33.279
<i>After Barry and Erica let</i>

17:33.350 --> 17:34.881
<i>their rivalry go too far,</i>

17:34.912 --> 17:36.446
<i>they set aside their differences</i>

17:36.480 --> 17:38.943
<i>to put a very important
relationship back together.</i>

17:38.985 --> 17:41.232
If you're here to have me settle
another argument, it's not happening.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.600
We're not. We came here
to say we're sorry.

17:43.670 --> 17:44.723
You were right.

17:44.783 --> 17:47.051
We spent the last 18
years living together,

17:47.119 --> 17:49.256
and clearly that wasn't
meant to extend to college.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.279
You were also right about
the way we treated you.

17:51.341 --> 17:52.356
It wasn't great.

17:52.391 --> 17:55.560
The only thing we can agree
on is that you're the best.

17:55.627 --> 17:58.645
I appreciate that, but you
guys got to figure this out.

17:58.715 --> 18:00.856
Oh, don't worry. I think we did.

18:00.903 --> 18:02.713
I'm moving out of the dorm,

18:02.775 --> 18:05.080
and into the Jenkintown
Posse's Jenkintown Pad.

18:05.119 --> 18:07.008
JTP's JTP!

18:07.042 --> 18:09.549
None of us were loving
our living situations.

18:09.596 --> 18:11.179
And we hang out so much together anyway.

18:11.213 --> 18:13.281
Now, we don't have that painful
goodbye at the end of each hang.

18:13.349 --> 18:15.635
And this way, we don't
have a screechy lady

18:15.690 --> 18:17.628
yelling at us to keep it down.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.643
- You get it.
- Sort of.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.089
And check out this sick hole.

18:21.123 --> 18:22.479
You can see the wiring and the pipes.

18:22.526 --> 18:23.725
And there's bars on the window

18:23.759 --> 18:26.525
because these party animals
have to be caged.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.630
But seriously, no one should
come and go after dark.

18:28.697 --> 18:29.898
The floor's not level, either.

18:29.932 --> 18:31.502
Look how this bullet we found rolls.

18:33.392 --> 18:36.137
- I think it's gonna be great.
- For all of us.

18:36.205 --> 18:37.538
You know, when you're not my roommate,

18:37.609 --> 18:39.304
you're a pretty good brother.

18:39.375 --> 18:41.093
Not too bad, yourself.

18:42.645 --> 18:43.811
I'm not sure this is the safest...

18:43.879 --> 18:45.947
Shh! Look how happy they are.

18:45.981 --> 18:48.073
<i>While Barry and
Erica had closed the book</i>

18:48.136 --> 18:50.285
<i>on living together,
I was encouraging my mom</i>

18:50.319 --> 18:52.987
<i>to keep writing her story
as a cookbook author.</i>

18:53.055 --> 18:54.823
Adam, I said I was done.

18:54.894 --> 18:56.057
You can't be!

18:56.091 --> 18:57.894
You've always told me
my dreams are possible,

18:57.949 --> 18:59.417
so I'm here to tell you the same thing.

18:59.449 --> 19:01.162
I know. But we tried it my way,

19:01.230 --> 19:03.131
and we tried it your way,
and neither was good.

19:03.165 --> 19:06.000
But there's another way.
We do it together.

19:06.068 --> 19:07.758
You pull back on the horror stories,

19:07.813 --> 19:09.604
and I pull back on the schmaltz,

19:09.638 --> 19:11.110
and then, we meet
somewhere in the middle.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.829
You think that would work?

19:12.891 --> 19:14.008
I know it will.

19:19.315 --> 19:20.961
I'll get the typewriter.

19:21.008 --> 19:22.640
<i>Sometimes, preserving a relationship</i>

19:22.726 --> 19:25.286
<i>just means adjusting the ingredients.</i>

19:25.321 --> 19:27.989
Well, looks like you got this
place all to yourself now.

19:28.023 --> 19:31.092
Yeah, I'm thinking about
getting a new roommate.

19:31.126 --> 19:34.718
I have someone in mind,
but I treated him really crappy.

19:35.464 --> 19:36.718
What are you saying?

19:37.433 --> 19:39.367
I'm saying that,

19:39.435 --> 19:42.470
if you can forgive me
for being such a jerk,

19:42.504 --> 19:44.287
I would love if you
would move in with me.

19:44.372 --> 19:45.447
Is this really happening?

19:45.479 --> 19:47.104
If you say "yes."

19:49.178 --> 19:51.145
<i>Sometimes, the
answers to all our problems</i>

19:51.180 --> 19:52.799
<i>are right in front of us the whole time.</i>

19:52.838 --> 19:54.115
This is amazing, Mom.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.253
<i>And who knows?</i>

19:55.284 --> 19:57.478
<i>They may even be just a phone call away.</i>

19:59.269 --> 20:00.495
Hello.

20:01.848 --> 20:03.533
Oh. Hi, Mr. Whitby.

20:04.095 --> 20:05.662
You read the rewrite?

20:05.730 --> 20:07.330
Oh.

20:07.398 --> 20:09.270
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay.

20:10.726 --> 20:12.286
- Well?
- Tell us.

20:13.971 --> 20:16.151
I'm a [bleep] cookbook author!

20:16.229 --> 20:17.818
<i>In the end,</i>

20:17.872 --> 20:20.083

Cheggit. My mom sent me one of
her famous honey salt pies.

20:53.090 --> 20:54.457
Ooh, smells delish.

20:54.491 --> 20:55.582
Let me rip into a slice.

20:55.653 --> 20:57.987
It's funny that you say "rip,"
because this recipe

20:58.022 --> 20:59.889
actually comes from
my great-great-uncle Harold.

20:59.957 --> 21:01.367
Every limb of his body was ripped off

21:01.433 --> 21:02.466
by an amateur circus bear.

21:02.523 --> 21:03.450
Oh, my God, what?

21:03.489 --> 21:04.945
Yeah, but don't worry.
The bear didn't kill him.

21:04.999 --> 21:06.640
He just left him as a stump and a head.

21:06.687 --> 21:09.179
- And that's good?
- Well, not for what comes next.

21:09.249 --> 21:11.108
He was on top of a hill,
and lost control of

21:11.187 --> 21:13.706
his crude homemade body wagon,
and he was thrown 100 feet

21:13.768 --> 21:16.557
into a nearby river,
and bobbed for six miles.

21:16.604 --> 21:18.292
Luckily, another bear came
and finished him off.

21:18.354 --> 21:20.557
Two bears? That's the most
horrible thing I've ever heard!

21:20.596 --> 21:21.617
Yeah, it's not great.

21:21.687 --> 21:23.993
But bears like honey,
so grab yourself a fork.
