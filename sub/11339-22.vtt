00:13.404 --> 00:15.138
Come on, breathe!
Come on, I'm not losing you.

00:15.206 --> 00:17.073
Ambulance is on its way.
Come on, stay with me.

00:17.141 --> 00:19.142
There's no pulse.

Aah!

01:19.670 --> 01:21.271
Hey, you ok, buddy?
You all right?

01:21.338 --> 01:22.338
Mm-hmm.
Good. Ok.

01:22.390 --> 01:24.724
Get back in there.
Go on. Good job.

01:28.846 --> 01:29.813
Good morning.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.147
How was your weekend?

01:31.198 --> 01:32.949
Good. Jack had 2 soccer
games yesterday.

01:33.017 --> 01:34.150
They win?

01:34.218 --> 01:37.070
Oh, we don't keep score
in Jack's age group.

01:37.154 --> 01:38.154
- That bad, huh?
- Yeah.

01:38.222 --> 01:39.656
And now they've asked me
to coach.

01:39.707 --> 01:40.740
You're kidding.

01:40.825 --> 01:42.492
Why'd they ask you?

01:42.543 --> 01:43.960
Focus.

01:44.027 --> 01:45.378
Don't doubt that.

01:45.463 --> 01:47.664
You can't get half the parents
to look up from their phones

01:47.732 --> 01:49.833
during the game.
At least I participate.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.335
It's not like
you're too busy.

01:52.403 --> 01:53.803
Let's get started.

01:53.871 --> 01:55.105
Yes.

01:55.172 --> 01:56.806
Unidentified young woman

01:56.874 --> 01:59.175
plunged off
a roadside cliff

01:59.226 --> 02:01.177
in Lake Worth,
North Carolina.

02:01.228 --> 02:03.680
That is 200 miles
outside of Raleigh.

02:03.731 --> 02:06.182
Most of the people
who live there are retired

02:06.233 --> 02:07.751
or have moved there
for a slower pace

02:07.818 --> 02:09.519
and now work
in the tourism industry.

02:09.570 --> 02:11.454
This woman survived?

02:11.522 --> 02:12.922
Yes. Local sheriff found her.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.408
No one her age was
missing from the town?

02:14.433 --> 02:15.129
Nope.

02:15.130 --> 02:16.226
So why do they need us?

02:16.227 --> 02:17.494
Here's the thing--

02:17.561 --> 02:20.296
3 years ago, some coyotes
found the torso

02:20.364 --> 02:22.932
of a Jane Doe
in the woods nearby.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.617
She sustained similar injuries.

02:24.702 --> 02:27.587
Both women had stab wounds all over
their bodies from various weapons.

02:27.671 --> 02:29.639
New girl's fingerprints
didn't lead anywhere.

02:29.707 --> 02:31.195
Her wounds haven't scarred.

02:31.220 --> 02:32.613
He probably didn't have her
for very long.

02:32.676 --> 02:34.344
She's got dirt on her clothes
and under her nails.

02:34.411 --> 02:36.880
She'd been raped repeatedly
and tortured.

02:36.931 --> 02:38.381
Sadists usually restrain
their victims

02:38.449 --> 02:40.316
on their own turf,
don't they?

02:40.384 --> 02:42.135
That's right. It means
he's from Lake Worth

02:42.219 --> 02:43.620
and didn't mean
for her to get away.

02:43.687 --> 02:45.421
She probably saw an opportunity
to flee and she took it.

02:45.489 --> 02:47.357
If the unsub has a torture
chamber in the area,

02:47.424 --> 02:49.926
he's not gonna leave it
empty for long. Let's go.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.612
Agathon said,

04:05.679 --> 04:08.381
"of this alone even
God is deprived--

04:08.449 --> 04:11.284
"the power of making things
that are past

04:11.352 --> 04:14.120
never to have been."

04:14.188 --> 04:15.622
Doctor's report says
our critical victim's

04:15.689 --> 04:16.623
in her late teens.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.257
Just like
the first Jane Doe.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.959
No one from town is missing,
which mean he most likely

04:20.027 --> 04:21.628
picks his victims up
outside Lake Worth.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.631
The 2008 Jane Doe was found
in the woods over here,

04:24.682 --> 04:26.066
and the most recent victim

04:26.133 --> 04:27.634
was found on the south side
of the lake

04:27.685 --> 04:28.635
heading out of town.

04:28.686 --> 04:29.886
So the unsub most likely

04:29.970 --> 04:31.538
holds them somewhere
in between.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.306
How long do we think
he held his new victim?

04:33.374 --> 04:34.574
The bruises
are still green,

04:34.642 --> 04:35.909
which means they're
no more than 8 days old.

04:35.976 --> 04:36.910
Her body's dehydrated,

04:36.977 --> 04:38.778
suggesting he wants to
keep them weak.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.314
But he underestimated her.
When she had the chance she ran.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.416
Is it possible the 2008 Jane Doe
was his first victim?

04:43.484 --> 04:46.219
80% of sexual sadists
have a dozen or more victims

04:46.287 --> 04:48.571
in their past.
They lead normal lives

04:48.656 --> 04:50.156
and eventually develop
God complexes.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.925
They usually have a ruse
that helps them abduct

04:51.992 --> 04:53.259
the victims as well.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.894
Garcia's looking
for missing persons

04:54.962 --> 04:56.496
in the neighboring states.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.131
Good. Dave, you, Reid and I
will go to the hospital,

04:58.198 --> 04:59.165
see if we can talk
to the victim.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.467
Seaver and I
will hit the crime scene.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.534
Good.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.442
What are her injuries?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.678
The fall caused
a C-4 spinal fracture,

05:11.729 --> 05:13.313
paralyzing her
from the neck down.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.982
She had an enormous amount
of internal bleeding

05:16.049 --> 05:18.651
and an elevated heavy metal
count in her blood.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.321
What, uh, what is he doing?

05:21.388 --> 05:23.273
He's profiling her.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.108
We have an unconscious Jane Doe,

05:25.192 --> 05:28.661
yet we can still learn
a lot about who she is

05:28.729 --> 05:30.130
by studying her body.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.782
This wasn't
a high-risk victim

05:32.867 --> 05:34.734
like a drug addict
or a prostitute.

05:34.785 --> 05:36.503
Orthodontic works
shows she was cared for,

05:36.570 --> 05:38.505
most likely from
a middle-class family.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.406
Tan lines are fading,
which means she's probably

05:40.474 --> 05:42.475
from a warm climate or spent
a lot of time outdoors,

05:42.543 --> 05:44.744
probably playing sports.
Shin splits on the right leg

05:44.812 --> 05:46.146
further supports the theory
that she's an athlete,

05:46.213 --> 05:47.463
which means if she escaped
from her captor,

05:47.548 --> 05:48.715
she could have run for miles.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.967
What about the patterns
in her wounds?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.685
I'm not sure what he used
to cut her with,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.154
but it definitely
wasn't a knife.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.923
Dr. Boyd,
she's opened her eyes.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.228
I've been on the job
for about 2 weeks.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.096
Did you think it was
a sadist back then?

06:04.148 --> 06:05.231
Most definitely.

06:05.299 --> 06:07.033
We opened an
investigation in '08,

06:07.100 --> 06:09.035
but it quickly
became a cold case.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.937
Well, the new girl
must have surprised you.

06:10.988 --> 06:13.039
Oh, when we found
her body on the road,

06:13.106 --> 06:15.108
I thought the two cases
were related,

06:15.176 --> 06:17.410
so I called you guys.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.246
You must have seen
this kind of thing in Philly.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.614
That's exactly
why I left.

06:21.665 --> 06:23.249
I thought here I'd
be ticketing tourists

06:23.317 --> 06:25.335
or citing locals
for growing pot.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.886
But never this.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.306
What do you think
she was running from?

06:30.391 --> 06:32.525
Well, there's nothing but acres
and acres of forest up there.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.061
The dogs picked up her scent
going this way.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.930
That's towards town?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.815
Yeah, but her scent
soon tapered off.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.568
All right, why don't we
go this way.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.569
Why?

06:42.636 --> 06:44.237
If the unsub knew
Jane Doe escaped,

06:44.304 --> 06:45.805
he may have taken
forensic countermeasures

06:45.856 --> 06:48.808
to make us think that she headed
in the opposite direction.

06:48.859 --> 06:50.159
Oh.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.146
Hi.

06:53.214 --> 06:56.783
I'm Dr. Spencer Reid
from the FBI.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.018
Can you tell me your name?

07:03.857 --> 07:06.292
Can you tell me
who did this to you?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.661
He hurt...

07:12.499 --> 07:13.766
Who hurt?

07:13.834 --> 07:15.935
He has...

07:16.003 --> 07:18.538
M...

07:19.723 --> 07:21.507
Mercy.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.343
Mercy.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.478
Who is "he"?

07:28.148 --> 07:29.315
Doctor,
her stats are dropping.

07:29.383 --> 07:30.950
It's intracranial bleed.
Call the O.R.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.119
Reid.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.738
BP 62 over 43.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.357
Defib.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.708
No pulse.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.709
Clear!

07:39.793 --> 07:40.827
Move her gown.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.312
"He has mercy"?

07:59.379 --> 08:01.481
That's what
it sounded like,

08:01.548 --> 08:04.233
our unsub must be
a master manipulator

08:04.318 --> 08:05.735
to have her thinking that.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.737
He probably didn't have her
for more than a week,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.105
but she learned to adapt.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.730
Do you smell that?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.032
Yeah.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.433
Ammonia.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.274
Guys.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.510
Oh, God.

08:42.589 --> 08:45.491
It reminds me of Elizabeth Smart
and Jaycee Dugard.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.761
Their captors forced them
to play out their fantasies

08:48.812 --> 08:51.280
and they obliged to stay alive.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.333
Yeah, Morgan.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.967
Yeah, Hotch.
You gotta get down here.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.202
There's something
you gotta see.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.705
What did you find?

09:05.662 --> 09:08.164
First we started smelling ammonia
and then we came across this.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.016
- How many bodies?
- 3.

09:10.084 --> 09:11.517
That shallow
grave was empty.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.152
You think
our victim was in it?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.220
It looked fresh.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.189
So he probably took her
down to be buried.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.690
And that's when
she escaped.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.693
Forensics thinks some of these
graves may be up to 10 years old.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.395
Got another one!

09:22.463 --> 09:24.197
What the hell? Jeez.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.299
Garcia needs to check
missing persons cases

09:26.367 --> 09:27.867
going back at least 10 years.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.909
Garcia said 8 teenage girls
have gone missing

09:36.977 --> 09:39.195
from the Carolinas
in the past decade.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.048
The hospitalized
Jane Doe was blond.

09:42.116 --> 09:43.883
3 of the 8 are blondes.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.918
What about the recent
missing person reports?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.253
Nothing came up.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.855
I'm going to put you
on speaker, Garcia.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.258
So, your girl wonder just
got a call from Raleigh P.D.

09:52.326 --> 09:54.544
Who heard we were looking
for for a missing person.

09:54.628 --> 09:58.514
It turns out that Shreveport police
found an abandoned car today

09:58.599 --> 10:00.716
that is registered to a
Mr. and Mrs. Linda and Don Owens

10:00.801 --> 10:02.135
of Raleigh, North Carolina.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.703
What's that
got to do with this?

10:03.771 --> 10:05.104
Ok, this is why
this is important.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.606
It turns out Mr. and Mrs. Owens
let their daughter,

10:06.673 --> 10:08.074
who goes to
North Carolina College,

10:08.142 --> 10:10.009
borrow their car so that
her and her best friend

10:10.060 --> 10:11.811
could drive to Tampa
for spring break.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.212
But they never made it there.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.447
What are the girls' names?

10:14.515 --> 10:16.899
Angela Proctor and Marcy Owens.
Both are 19 years old.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.251
Are they blond?

10:18.318 --> 10:19.819
Marcy is, Angela's a brunette.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.287
Do you have photographs?

10:21.355 --> 10:23.423
Yeah. That's why I've already
sent them to your phones.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.624
If the girl in
the hospital is Angela,

10:24.691 --> 10:25.875
she probably wasn't saying
"he has mercy,"

10:25.959 --> 10:27.960
she was saying, "he has Marcy."

10:29.563 --> 10:32.732
Dad, can I come out?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.168
Honey, daddy's really busy
right now.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.004
I have to use
the bathroom.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.556
I'm making you a gift.
Hurry up.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.907
Where's Angela?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.809
You're all alone now.

11:31.725 --> 11:32.959
So this guy
dyed Angela's hair?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.460
It's not unusual
for an unsub

11:34.528 --> 11:36.946
to manipulate his victim
to fit his fantasy.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.464
And you don't think
he's killed Marcy?

11:38.532 --> 11:40.283
Hopefully she fits
his delusion

11:40.367 --> 11:42.768
and he's continuing
to play it out with her.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.670
It's imperative
we alert the community.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.606
Well, you do
what you gotta do.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.625
When this gets out,
it's gonna kill tourism.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.712
My only concern right now
is for the girl.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.331
The lab confirmed
that the 3 graves

11:55.415 --> 11:57.333
contained blond women
in their late teens.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.051
So the unsub
does have a type.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.820
He was probably hurt by one
or in love with one.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.656
Sexual sadists have rage,
and based on Angela's wounds,

12:03.724 --> 12:04.757
my money's on hurt.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.259
You know, Raleigh's
4 hours away.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.760
That's quite a distance
to go to abduct the girls.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.762
Well, he must feel
comfortable in that area.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.014
Where's our list of locals
with sexual records?

12:12.099 --> 12:13.015
Here.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.603
Speak and be heard,
my superfriends.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.273
Garcia, check to see if any of
our suspects with sexual offenses

12:20.340 --> 12:22.658
had any priors
outside of Lake Worth.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.177
Sam Edmann. He was booked

12:25.245 --> 12:29.615
in '65 for...Fondling
his girlfriend's 6-year-old son.

12:29.683 --> 12:30.783
More recent.

12:30.851 --> 12:35.621
Mark Hillman was busted
in 2009

12:35.689 --> 12:36.956
for flashing a girl.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.191
Flashing doesn't really
say sexual sadist.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.328
Right, right.
Ok, what about--eew--

12:42.379 --> 12:43.729
Marcus Talbot.

12:43.797 --> 12:47.199
He was nabbed for peeping
into holes in the walls

12:47.267 --> 12:51.837
in the girls bathroom at
the art institute 15 years ago.

12:51.905 --> 12:52.939
What does he do now?

12:53.006 --> 12:55.141
He is...

12:55.192 --> 12:57.443
Oh, jeez, really?

12:57.511 --> 12:59.145
People do not
do their homework.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.863
He is currently
the art teacher

13:00.948 --> 13:03.349
at the high school at Lake Worth
where you guys are right now.

13:03.417 --> 13:04.884
He spends a lot of time
with teenage girls.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.852
Seaver, stay here
and wait for the parents.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.454
Reid and Morgan,
go to Talbot's house.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.022
Dave and I will go
to the school.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.252
The goal is not
to change your subjects,

13:40.320 --> 13:44.390
but for the subjects to
change the photographer.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.752
What do you think
this picture is saying?

14:19.693 --> 14:20.926
Yeah, Morgan.

14:20.977 --> 14:22.495
Hotch, it's him.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.597
I just found a small
NCC sweatshirt with blood on it

14:25.649 --> 14:26.966
hidden in the shed.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.434
There's no sign
of the girl, though.

14:28.502 --> 14:32.288
If the eyes are the windows
into the soul,

14:32.372 --> 14:33.506
what is she thinking?

14:33.573 --> 14:34.840
Was she asked a question

14:34.908 --> 14:37.243
just as the picture
was taken?

14:37.310 --> 14:39.278
Is she happy?

14:39.346 --> 14:40.479
Sad?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.248
Scared?

14:45.335 --> 14:48.287
Mr. Talbot, may I see you
for a second?

14:49.623 --> 14:51.023
Um...

14:51.091 --> 14:53.292
Uh--uh--think about
your answers.

14:53.343 --> 14:55.010
I'll be right back.

14:57.531 --> 14:58.698
Marcus Talbot?

14:58.765 --> 15:00.232
Yes.
You're under arrest

15:00.300 --> 15:01.734
for the kidnappings
of Angela

15:01.801 --> 15:02.902
and Marcy Owens.
What?!

15:02.969 --> 15:04.437
You have the right
to remain silent.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.238
Anything you say
can and will

15:06.306 --> 15:08.774
be used against you in a court of law.
You're making a mistake!

15:08.825 --> 15:10.309
You're making a mistake!

15:48.325 --> 15:51.061
It's only been an hour and there
are people outside already.

15:51.142 --> 15:53.359
The beauty of a small town.

15:53.427 --> 15:56.129
I assume Talbot's
not married?

15:56.197 --> 15:58.198
Guys like Talbot
are loners.

15:58.265 --> 16:00.200
They like to operate
without a spouse

16:00.267 --> 16:02.035
looking over
their shoulder.

16:02.103 --> 16:04.838
Don't we all.

16:10.644 --> 16:12.011
How's it going, Reid?

16:12.079 --> 16:13.997
I don't think he had
Marcy or Angela here.

16:14.081 --> 16:15.632
Maybe he has
a secondary location.

16:15.699 --> 16:17.150
You know, trophy or not,
it's pretty careless

16:17.201 --> 16:18.818
to keep Angela's clothes.

16:18.886 --> 16:21.121
He's plagued by
a fear of chaos

16:21.188 --> 16:24.357
and obsesses over
any disorder.

16:24.425 --> 16:26.159
Well, welcome to 1992.

16:26.227 --> 16:28.128
Yeah, music's
his only entertainment.

16:28.179 --> 16:31.381
He doesn't have a TV
or a computer.

16:35.052 --> 16:37.637
Just your type, isn't she?

16:37.688 --> 16:40.690
You can't just hold me here.

16:40.774 --> 16:44.177
I did not kidnap
those girls.

16:44.245 --> 16:46.179
I love kids.

16:46.247 --> 16:49.482
I mean, I'm a teacher.

16:50.851 --> 16:54.737
And, uh, speaking of which,

16:54.822 --> 16:57.123
I have another class
starting in an hour.

16:57.191 --> 16:59.025
Yeah, well,
class is canceled.

16:59.093 --> 17:01.211
Then I want my phone call.

17:01.295 --> 17:02.829
The phones are down.

17:05.031 --> 17:06.833
What are you
gonna do to me?

17:06.901 --> 17:08.601
What am I gonna do?

17:08.669 --> 17:10.203
I'm gonna wait!

17:10.253 --> 17:11.671
Until you tell me
where that other girl is.

17:11.722 --> 17:12.805
Sheriff.

17:13.907 --> 17:17.277
Excuse me, may I have
a word with you, please?

17:28.889 --> 17:32.825
If Talbot has her, it's critical
the way we talk to him.

17:32.893 --> 17:34.627
I've broken tougher scumbags
than this perv.

17:34.695 --> 17:35.795
I'm sure you have.

17:35.863 --> 17:37.797
But we found
a burial site,

17:37.865 --> 17:39.866
so this is no longer
just about Marcy and Angela.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.768
So you don't want me
in there?

17:41.835 --> 17:43.169
No, not now.

17:47.258 --> 17:49.792
Unbelievable.

17:49.877 --> 17:51.261
Hmm.

17:53.430 --> 17:54.881
I don't get it.

17:59.270 --> 18:01.387
You got Angela's parents
in there?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.972
They're devastated.

18:03.057 --> 18:05.141
Ok, stay with them.
I'm gonna go talk to Marcy's parents.

18:05.226 --> 18:07.143
- Ok.
- Thanks.

18:20.324 --> 18:22.976
I don't know this girl
or the other one.

18:23.043 --> 18:25.245
How many times do I
have to tell you that?

18:25.312 --> 18:28.348
This is Angela .
She's dead.

18:28.415 --> 18:31.651
And the other one
is Marcy Owens.

18:31.719 --> 18:35.471
Now, it makes sense that you
wouldn't know their names.

18:35.556 --> 18:39.225
I swear to you,
I didn't kidnap them.

18:39.293 --> 18:41.477
You know, the other thing
I've learned about you guys,

18:41.562 --> 18:44.530
it's never just one secret.

18:50.988 --> 18:53.690
Wow, this guy's old school.
He shoots on film.

18:53.774 --> 18:56.109
He's too controlling to let
anyone else develop it.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.286
Looks like Angela
wasn't his only secret.

19:14.661 --> 19:16.763
Wow.

19:21.435 --> 19:22.685
What have you got?

19:22.770 --> 19:24.304
It looks like this guy
Talbot had another hobby.

19:24.355 --> 19:27.073
The girls in these photos
can't be more than 16 years old.

19:27.141 --> 19:28.641
Photos.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.144
Morgan, how many are there?

19:31.195 --> 19:33.396
I'm thinking 30, 40.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.732
54.

19:35.816 --> 19:38.151
Excuse me. That's 54.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.819
They're my students.

19:39.870 --> 19:42.655
First you put a hole
in the girls bathroom wall,

19:42.706 --> 19:43.706
and now this?

19:43.791 --> 19:46.559
I don't even take
the pictures. They do.

19:46.627 --> 19:48.294
You think that matters?

19:48.362 --> 19:51.097
You know, at first
the pictures are enough.

19:51.165 --> 19:53.032
But then those urges
come back.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.168
You have to touch one.

19:55.219 --> 19:57.870
And that's why you took
Marcy and Angela.

19:57.921 --> 19:59.872
It isn't like that.

19:59.923 --> 20:01.507
I don't hurt those girls.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.242
I teach them.

20:03.310 --> 20:04.544
I would never hurt them.

20:04.611 --> 20:06.062
I love them.

20:06.146 --> 20:08.081
You love taking pictures
of them.

20:08.148 --> 20:09.065
It's a hobby.

20:09.149 --> 20:10.183
It's a ruse!

20:10.250 --> 20:11.918
You prey on the vulnerability
of young women.

20:11.985 --> 20:14.821
You take them alone into
your house, alone in the dark.

20:14.888 --> 20:16.489
You have them
all to yourself.

20:16.557 --> 20:17.690
That's not true.

20:17.741 --> 20:20.193
Now, you tell me
where Marcy is right now,

20:20.260 --> 20:23.996
and as much as I hate it,
I'll make things easier for you.

20:24.064 --> 20:26.833
I told you,
I don't know her.

21:20.487 --> 21:23.589
Is this where this freak
first saw Marcy?

21:23.657 --> 21:26.325
When was the last time
you spoke to Marcy?

21:26.393 --> 21:29.429
She texted me a few
times during the trip.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.165
But you didn't actually
speak to her?

21:32.232 --> 21:34.867
Uh, it's her first year
in college.

21:34.935 --> 21:37.703
It's not unusual that we go for a
couple of days without talking.

21:37.771 --> 21:38.805
I understand.

21:38.872 --> 21:40.373
Earlier in the trip,

21:40.441 --> 21:42.675
she uses text abbreviations,

21:42.743 --> 21:46.345
but later on she spells out

21:46.413 --> 21:48.214
some of the same words
she abbreviated.

21:51.485 --> 21:52.702
Mr. Owens: You think
he was texting us,

21:52.786 --> 21:54.504
pretending he was
the girls in Tampa?

21:54.588 --> 21:55.988
Probably.

21:56.039 --> 21:58.391
Mrs. Owens: My God.

22:00.210 --> 22:04.197
So this guy sees Marcy here
on a family vacation,

22:04.264 --> 22:06.098
then follows her to school?

22:06.166 --> 22:07.600
Who does that?

22:07.668 --> 22:10.336
He's a resident of Lake Worth
with a history in Raleigh,

22:10.404 --> 22:12.605
but chances are
he met the girls here.

22:12.673 --> 22:13.606
Marcy.

22:13.674 --> 22:15.007
He met Marcy.

22:15.075 --> 22:17.009
Angela's never been here.

22:17.077 --> 22:19.912
We saw what he did
to her body.

22:19.980 --> 22:21.914
Do you think he did that
to her every day?

22:21.982 --> 22:24.016
We're not sure, ma'am.

22:27.921 --> 22:30.323
I am so sorry.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.191
When you vacationed
in Lake Worth in the past,

22:32.259 --> 22:34.193
did Marcy ever
go to summer camp?

22:34.261 --> 22:35.861
Uh, a few times,

22:35.913 --> 22:37.713
at the community
center.

22:37.798 --> 22:40.032
Do you know if she
ever took a photography class

22:40.100 --> 22:42.034
with a man named
Marcus Talbot?

22:42.102 --> 22:43.236
Yeah.

22:43.303 --> 22:45.705
She loved it.

22:45.772 --> 22:47.940
Do you know if they were
ever alone together?

22:48.008 --> 22:49.842
Why are you asking?

22:49.893 --> 22:51.043
Is he a suspect?

22:51.111 --> 22:53.880
He's someone
we're talking to.

22:53.947 --> 22:56.949
Do you know
if she was alone with him?

22:58.235 --> 23:01.621
We don't know.
She was gone all day.

23:01.688 --> 23:04.757
He held the class
at his house.

23:04.825 --> 23:06.592
His darkroom was there.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.027
It was?

23:13.433 --> 23:14.967
Marcy was in
your summer camp in 2006.

23:15.035 --> 23:16.335
Ok.

23:16.403 --> 23:18.504
She was 14. She took it again
for the next 4 summers.

23:18.572 --> 23:19.505
Students like me.

23:19.573 --> 23:21.007
Come on, Talbot,
you groomed her!

23:21.074 --> 23:22.975
You just couldn't
wait anymore!

23:31.718 --> 23:34.687
If you're telling me she was
in my house, I believe you,

23:34.754 --> 23:37.690
but I didn't touch her.
I didn't do it.

23:39.059 --> 23:40.326
What?!

23:40.394 --> 23:43.446
Hey, Rossi, I think the dog
just found something else here.

23:43.530 --> 23:47.533
Well, this just doesn't look
very good for you, Talbot.

23:47.601 --> 23:49.986
I want my damn lawyer.

23:57.277 --> 24:00.379
This doesn't
make any sense.

24:00.447 --> 24:02.648
The grave's fresh.

24:02.716 --> 24:04.150
He either dug it quickly
because he knew we were coming--

24:04.217 --> 24:05.518
or somebody else did.

24:05.586 --> 24:06.786
We just found
that burial site

24:06.853 --> 24:07.987
that was
off the property.

24:08.055 --> 24:10.323
The guy uses
countermeasures.

24:10.390 --> 24:12.858
Here's there's just evidence
lying all around.

24:12.926 --> 24:15.227
Reid, he wouldn't
operate like this.

24:15.295 --> 24:17.496
Someone's framing Talbot.

24:17.564 --> 24:19.131
Yeah, but who?

24:32.913 --> 24:34.647
Hey.

24:34.698 --> 24:35.948
Hey.

24:35.999 --> 24:37.533
How are you?

24:37.618 --> 24:39.952
Oh, God.

24:40.003 --> 24:43.456
It was so busy
at the restaurant today.

24:48.328 --> 24:52.064
Are you happy
to see me, Rose?

25:05.850 --> 25:08.969
I could nail Talbot right now
on physical evidence alone.

25:09.036 --> 25:10.937
But it doesn't fit
the unsub's actual behavior.

25:10.988 --> 25:12.606
This guy uses forensic
countermeasures.

25:12.673 --> 25:14.307
He doesn't leave evidence
all over the place.

25:14.375 --> 25:16.443
Our unsub's attempting
to frame Talbot.

25:16.510 --> 25:17.811
When Angela got away,
he probably panicked.

25:17.879 --> 25:19.112
And he thought he could
pin it on him.

25:19.180 --> 25:20.614
He must have known
Marcy had a connection

25:20.665 --> 25:22.499
to Talbot's
photography class.

25:22.583 --> 25:24.668
And that Talbot has a proclivity
towards girls that age.

25:24.752 --> 25:25.952
We're on the right track.
We're looking for somebody

25:26.003 --> 25:27.454
with a similar story
to Talbot.

25:27.505 --> 25:29.456
He's a resident of Lake Worth
even if he's not a native.

25:29.507 --> 25:31.491
And it's likely he has ties
to other parts of the state.

25:31.559 --> 25:32.959
He's running away
from something.

25:33.010 --> 25:35.662
Our unsub must have known
Talbot had a secret

25:35.730 --> 25:36.829
because he has one, too.

25:36.881 --> 25:38.048
Yeah, but how do we find it?

25:38.132 --> 25:39.132
Talbot's got a lawyer
on the way.

25:39.183 --> 25:40.350
If I don't book him now,
he walks.

25:40.434 --> 25:41.568
Then the longer we can
keep Talbot in custody,

25:41.636 --> 25:43.036
the better chance we have
of finding Marcy.

25:43.104 --> 25:44.237
And if he's released?

25:44.305 --> 25:46.106
The unsub will do whatever
he needs to do to survive.

25:46.173 --> 25:47.891
And we lose Marcy.

25:47.975 --> 25:49.776
Seaver, go to the Owens' cottage,
see if you can take a look at Marcy

25:49.843 --> 25:51.511
through the unsub's eyes.
Ok.

25:51.562 --> 25:53.280
Angela's autopsy
is almost finished.

25:53.347 --> 25:54.698
Reid, look at the report
when it comes in.

25:54.782 --> 25:56.716
Dave, you and Morgan
stay on Talbot.

25:56.784 --> 25:59.019
He knows who this guy is
even if he's not aware of it.

25:59.086 --> 26:01.087
Please!

26:01.155 --> 26:02.622
I'm not done yet, Rosie.

26:02.690 --> 26:04.224
Please, no.

26:08.963 --> 26:11.264
I don't get this.

26:11.332 --> 26:15.335
First you were grilling me
about kidnapping and murder,

26:15.403 --> 26:17.270
and now you want me
to help you.

26:17.338 --> 26:20.307
Someone had access to your house
that saw what I saw.

26:20.374 --> 26:21.942
I don't have to help you.

26:22.009 --> 26:24.711
You humiliated me for nothing.

26:24.779 --> 26:26.713
I thought you cared
about the girls.

26:28.015 --> 26:29.316
I do.

26:29.383 --> 26:31.217
Then start talking.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.787
We want the names of everyone
who's stepped foot in your house

26:33.854 --> 26:35.255
in the last 5 months.

26:43.798 --> 26:44.931
Hey.

26:44.999 --> 26:45.966
Hey.

26:47.868 --> 26:48.969
What's wrong?

26:49.036 --> 26:50.286
Nothing.

26:50.371 --> 26:51.638
Huh?

26:51.706 --> 26:53.740
What is it, Rosie?

26:53.808 --> 26:57.610
Why are you doing this, dad?

26:57.678 --> 27:00.313
I have a mom and a dad

27:00.381 --> 27:03.516
who are probably
worried about me.

27:03.584 --> 27:05.452
It's ok, Rosie.

27:05.519 --> 27:07.420
Things are gonna
get better.

27:07.488 --> 27:09.990
I'm not Rose.

27:10.057 --> 27:13.360
I'm Marcy Owens
from Raleigh, North Carolina.

27:13.427 --> 27:15.295
Rosie.

27:15.363 --> 27:17.197
I told you not to lie.

27:17.264 --> 27:19.499
I'm sorry.

27:19.567 --> 27:22.702
I'm sorry.

27:29.377 --> 27:31.678
Ok.

27:34.015 --> 27:38.118
Ok. It's ok.

27:38.185 --> 27:40.120
It's ok.

27:50.181 --> 27:53.633
Marcy wore a lot
of NCC stuff.

27:53.701 --> 27:55.969
She practically
lived in it.

27:59.807 --> 28:04.411
She advertised where
she was going to school.

28:05.813 --> 28:08.364
Is that how he knew
where to find her?

28:08.449 --> 28:09.749
We don't know that yet.

28:11.952 --> 28:14.921
Add Barbara Shuller

28:14.989 --> 28:16.372
and Ben Holtzman.

28:16.457 --> 28:19.626
They all developed
their film at your place?

28:19.693 --> 28:21.628
I'm the only gig in town.

28:21.695 --> 28:23.496
Everyone's gone digital.

28:23.547 --> 28:27.167
Who else has access
to your darkroom?

28:27.234 --> 28:30.136
Repairmen? A friend?

28:35.609 --> 28:39.279
Mr. Owens: We bought this
place when Marcy was 10.

28:40.681 --> 28:42.148
One for every year?

28:42.216 --> 28:43.683
There's an art festival
every summer.

28:43.751 --> 28:46.786
That's where she gets
most of this stuff.

28:46.854 --> 28:50.290
I'm sorry, I just don't know
how this is going to help.

28:50.357 --> 28:55.095
Knowing your routines
can be very useful.

28:55.162 --> 28:56.763
What else did you do?

28:57.748 --> 29:00.200
Sometimes we go to church.

29:00.267 --> 29:02.035
Marcy loves to sing.

29:03.037 --> 29:04.571
Was she in the choir?

29:04.638 --> 29:07.407
She's amazing.
Everyone was in awe

29:07.475 --> 29:09.776
when she got up
and did her solo.

29:12.212 --> 29:14.097
Ok, so I cross-checked
Morgan's list

29:14.181 --> 29:16.416
of people who may have
seen Talbot's darkroom

29:16.484 --> 29:18.084
with church membership.
I've got 5 matches.

29:18.152 --> 29:19.986
- You run backgrounds?
- Sure did.

29:20.054 --> 29:21.237
None of them have records.

29:21.322 --> 29:22.589
I found something
that might be helpful.

29:22.656 --> 29:24.657
Autopsy report revealed
fragments of glass

29:24.725 --> 29:26.392
in some of Angela's wounds.

29:26.443 --> 29:28.228
Were they able to identify
the blades used?

29:28.295 --> 29:29.779
Only that there were
a number of them.

29:29.864 --> 29:32.231
The doctor mentioned she had
heavy metals in her blood.

29:32.283 --> 29:33.833
Yeah. The highest
one being lead.

29:33.901 --> 29:35.668
Well, add that
to the unique patterns

29:35.736 --> 29:37.420
of her wounds
and the glass in her cuts,

29:37.505 --> 29:39.772
maybe this guy worked
with stained glass.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.608
Talbot had stained glass
in his front door.

29:41.675 --> 29:44.310
The Owens had stained glass
window chimes in their condo.

29:44.378 --> 29:46.146
Lead fumes can get
into your system

29:46.213 --> 29:47.780
during the soldering process.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.417
What? My second wife
was crafty.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.154
Garcia, anybody on the list
work with stained glass?

29:55.472 --> 29:57.056
Yeah. Robert Bremmer.

29:57.124 --> 29:59.959
Bremmer. Talbot said
he met him only once.

30:00.027 --> 30:02.946
Well, Mr. Bremmer's been a member
of the church for 16 years.

30:03.030 --> 30:05.965
He travels all over
the state doing craft fairs.

30:06.033 --> 30:07.567
He also owns
the Rose Cafe.

30:07.635 --> 30:08.935
Bingo, strange man voice.

30:09.003 --> 30:10.303
It looks like
he's from Wilkesboro.

30:10.371 --> 30:12.288
He moved there
to Lake Worth in '91

30:12.373 --> 30:14.541
after his wife and stepdaughter
were killed in a car accident.

30:14.608 --> 30:15.942
Was he a suspect?

30:16.010 --> 30:18.178
There's no record of that,
but...

30:18.245 --> 30:19.946
wait till you see
the picture.

30:19.997 --> 30:21.948
They look a lot alike.

30:25.586 --> 30:27.053
Where's the restaurant?

30:27.120 --> 30:28.388
Real close.

30:40.701 --> 30:42.969
Excuse me,
is Robert Bremmer here?

30:43.037 --> 30:44.837
Yeah. Robert?

30:44.905 --> 30:47.207
Robert?

30:48.609 --> 30:50.610
That's weird.
He was just here.

30:56.584 --> 30:59.318
He's gone.

31:11.498 --> 31:13.166
Rosie!

31:13.234 --> 31:14.517
It's time.

31:14.602 --> 31:15.518
Time for what?

31:15.603 --> 31:17.837
It's time to leave.

31:17.888 --> 31:19.505
I have a plan. Listen.

31:19.556 --> 31:21.474
I have a plan.

31:21.542 --> 31:26.346
And we will be together
forever. Ok?

31:26.413 --> 31:27.680
All right.

31:27.731 --> 31:29.399
Where are we going?

31:29.483 --> 31:30.400
Let's move.

31:30.484 --> 31:31.985
What do you mean
by forever? No.

31:32.036 --> 31:34.487
Let's go! Move it!

31:34.538 --> 31:35.872
Move. Move, move!

31:35.956 --> 31:38.408
Good girl. Yeah.

31:38.492 --> 31:39.876
That a girl.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.200
So here's the deal.

31:52.203 --> 31:53.353
Robert Bremmer
married a woman

31:53.454 --> 31:55.355
who had a daughter
from a previous relationship

31:55.423 --> 31:56.656
who was 10 years old
named Rose.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.593
Now, this woman
was super mentally unstable.

31:59.660 --> 32:01.878
She goes into the hospital
for depression.

32:01.963 --> 32:04.798
When she does, the only person
watching Rose is her stepdad Robert

32:04.866 --> 32:06.132
and he is accused
of abusing her.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.668
That's why women with daughters
seldom remarry.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.504
They fear men will prey
on their young.

32:10.571 --> 32:12.105
So the wife is released
from the hospital,

32:12.173 --> 32:14.841
the first thing she does is try to
leave Robert with her daughter,

32:14.892 --> 32:17.143
but every time she tries that,
he tracks them down.

32:17.211 --> 32:20.347
The mom is so out of her head that
in some sort of act of desperation

32:20.414 --> 32:23.149
she takes her life and
the life of her daughter Rose.

32:23.217 --> 32:25.819
According to police records,
she drove her car right into a lake

32:25.886 --> 32:27.387
somewhere around Wilkesboro.

32:58.752 --> 32:59.686
Hey, Hotch.

32:59.754 --> 33:00.854
Yeah?

33:00.922 --> 33:02.255
These chimes are just
like the ones I saw

33:02.356 --> 33:03.356
at the Owens condo.

33:16.604 --> 33:18.371
Sheriff.

33:52.506 --> 33:54.507
All clear down here.

33:57.945 --> 34:00.030
He's not inside.

34:00.114 --> 34:01.915
He's executing
his end game.

34:01.982 --> 34:03.383
How do you know?

34:03.451 --> 34:04.784
It's taken him 20 years
to find a replacement.

34:04.835 --> 34:06.419
This time he's gonna
die with her.

34:06.487 --> 34:07.687
In the lake. Let's go.

34:07.755 --> 34:11.625
Garcia, I need the make
and model of Bremmer's car.

34:12.827 --> 34:14.094
Sending it now.

34:22.053 --> 34:23.770
What are we doing?

34:23.837 --> 34:26.005
Where are you taking me?

34:34.864 --> 34:38.118
We can all be together
now, Rose.

34:38.185 --> 34:41.071
I know mommy's missed you,

34:41.155 --> 34:43.857
and she would love
to see you.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.829
Morgan, you head towards
the south end of the bridge.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.264
We're coming in from the west.

34:54.702 --> 34:56.636
No, no, no, no.

35:05.212 --> 35:08.515
Don't you say a word.

35:08.582 --> 35:10.850
Shh...

35:10.901 --> 35:13.019
It's ok.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.437
It's ok.

35:14.522 --> 35:15.755
It's ok. Shh.

35:15.823 --> 35:17.741
It's ok.

35:19.193 --> 35:22.162
We're almost there, Rose.

35:22.229 --> 35:23.329
Shh.

35:27.868 --> 35:29.135
What's up, Ted?

35:29.203 --> 35:31.121
Sorry, Henry.
We gotta check everyone.

35:31.205 --> 35:33.506
That's his car.

35:33.574 --> 35:35.759
Call Hotch.

35:36.877 --> 35:38.845
Hotch, we have a visual
on Bremmer

35:38.913 --> 35:41.264
at the Lake Worth roadblock.

35:47.921 --> 35:52.692
Robert Bremmer,
get out of the car!

35:52.760 --> 35:56.162
I won't let them take you
from me, Rose.

35:56.230 --> 35:58.765
I won't let them take you.

36:04.705 --> 36:06.272
No, dad, don't!

36:08.275 --> 36:09.826
Stop!

36:09.910 --> 36:11.778
Help me!

36:18.619 --> 36:21.221
Hotch, he's on the move.
Head him off. Head him off!

36:21.288 --> 36:23.006
No!

36:30.097 --> 36:33.433
Aah!

38:02.823 --> 38:04.824
Hey. Hey.

38:07.161 --> 38:09.996
She's got no pulse.

38:10.064 --> 38:12.799
Come on, I'm not
losing you. Come on!

38:12.867 --> 38:15.935
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

38:16.003 --> 38:18.104
1, 2, 3...

38:18.172 --> 38:20.006
1, 2...

38:20.074 --> 38:22.208
2, 3, 4...

38:22.259 --> 38:23.676
Come on,
stay with me.

38:23.744 --> 38:25.979
1, 2, 3...

38:26.046 --> 38:27.814
1, 2, 3...

38:27.882 --> 38:29.415
Come on.

38:40.427 --> 38:41.761
Come on!

38:43.797 --> 38:46.900
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

38:57.745 --> 38:59.245
You're gonna be ok.

39:12.593 --> 39:13.860
Appreciate it, thank you.

39:13.928 --> 39:15.662
Best of luck to you,
sheriff. Thank you.

39:25.940 --> 39:27.991
Time to go.

40:09.883 --> 40:12.552
Domenico Estrada wrote,

40:12.619 --> 40:16.889
"bring the past only if

40:30.220 --> 40:34.674
I know you're gonna do
that coaching thing.

40:34.742 --> 40:39.145
So I thought
maybe this might help.

40:39.213 --> 40:41.381
Soccer formations?

40:41.448 --> 40:42.849
I'm Italian.

40:42.916 --> 40:46.085
You've been
holding out on me.

40:46.153 --> 40:50.189
I, uh, I could use
an assistant.

40:50.257 --> 40:53.326
How early do they
start their games?

40:53.394 --> 40:54.861
Early.

40:56.229 --> 40:58.031
Thanks.

41:04.955 --> 41:06.072
Guys, don't bunch up!

41:06.123 --> 41:07.507
Don't bunch up!
