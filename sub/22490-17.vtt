00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
It's alive!

00:35.769 --> 00:36.827
Aah!

00:39.139 --> 00:42.108
Mmm! Oh, no! Ohh!

00:42.142 --> 00:44.872
Ahh...

00:44.911 --> 00:46.378
Yeah.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.812
You're a bitch.

00:47.847 --> 00:50.475
Ha ha ha ha! Sorry, little girl...

00:50.517 --> 00:53.281
but Queen Beryl needs your life force
in order to take over the planet earth.

00:53.319 --> 00:54.411
Ha ha ha ha!

00:54.454 --> 00:56.445
Serena, change into Sailor Moon, quickly.

00:56.489 --> 01:00.084
Right! Moon. Prism. Power.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.552
Ohh...

01:08.168 --> 01:11.831
In the name of the moon, I will punish...
Oh, my God.

01:11.871 --> 01:14.066
Ha ha ha! Hmm!

01:14.107 --> 01:17.270
What? What is it? Oh, man! Oh!

01:17.310 --> 01:19.278
L... I don't know why that happened.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.973
- Jeez!
- I'm so sorry.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.642
That is so disrespectful of me.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.048
You are pretty hot, though.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.315
Should we still fight?

01:27.353 --> 01:29.321
Because I don't really want to anymore.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.220
Um, you know,
the moment has definitely passed.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.088
All right.
See you next time... maybe.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.788
Yeah, sure. OK. Another time.

01:35.829 --> 01:39.196
Aw, yeah, man.
I am ridged for her pleasure.

01:39.232 --> 01:40.927
Big talk for a virgin.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.936
If I poon enough noobs,
I can raise my rank...

01:43.970 --> 01:46.438
in the server from three to one.
Hee hee!

01:46.473 --> 01:50.273
Be our ninety-ninth caller right now
to win our <i>Mission: Impossible 3</i> contest.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.505
Ooh, ooh.

01:52.545 --> 01:54.274
Hello.
You're our ninety-ninth caller.

01:54.314 --> 01:55.303
Excellent!

01:55.348 --> 01:57.248
You win your choice
of a Gameboy Advance...

01:57.283 --> 02:00.878
or a date
with <i>M:I 3</i> star Scarlett Johansson.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.478
- Can I have both?
- No.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.853
Do I have to choose right now?

02:03.890 --> 02:06.324
- Yes.
- Uh...

02:06.359 --> 02:07.348
Ooh...

02:07.393 --> 02:08.883
Um...

02:08.928 --> 02:11.328
Uh...

02:11.364 --> 02:13.628
Um...

02:13.666 --> 02:17.898
Oh...

02:17.937 --> 02:20.497
Uh...

02:20.540 --> 02:22.371
I guess I choose Scarlett Johansson.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.040
Look. Can't I just roll down the window
and shake his hand?

02:30.083 --> 02:31.914
No. The contest specifies lunch.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.248
Crap in a hat.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.515
So, do you ever play The Sims?

02:37.557 --> 02:40.458
I made a Scarlett Johansson Sim,
and she lived in my house...

02:40.493 --> 02:42.688
and sometimes
we went in the hot tub together...

02:42.729 --> 02:44.663
but I forgot to buy
a fire extinguisher...

02:44.697 --> 02:48.360
so there was a grease fire in the kitchen,
and Scarlett died.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.801
- Mm-hmm.
- Give us all your money.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.305
Aah! Leave us alone, you hooligans.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.772
Hyah! Ki-cha!

02:54.807 --> 02:57.799
- He fights like a tiger.
- Let's get out of here!

02:59.012 --> 03:00.274
That was so stellar.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.611
Gary is totally gonna score now.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.880
You... You saved me. You're my hero.

03:07.654 --> 03:08.916
Mmm...

03:15.929 --> 03:18.796
Do you take this be'hom
to be your be'nal?

03:18.831 --> 03:20.628
Hyah!

03:21.734 --> 03:24.464
A-goo! Goo goo goo.

03:26.706 --> 03:30.767
Scarlett, my love, there's
something I must tell you before I die.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.072
What is it, my love?

03:32.111 --> 03:34.773
I staged the whole fight
on our first date.

03:34.814 --> 03:37.476
I won your heart under false pretenses.

03:37.517 --> 03:40.145
Oh, thank God.

03:40.186 --> 03:42.154
I have something to tell you, too.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.918
I'm not really Scarlett Johansson.

03:44.958 --> 03:48.860
I was just a professional
Scarlett Johansson impersonator.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.228
Ahem. My real name
is Raymond Dibonatello...

03:52.265 --> 03:54.733
from Queens, New York.

03:54.767 --> 04:00.763
That explains why Scarlett Johansson
had a giant Johansson.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.870
Oh! Oh!

04:06.913 --> 04:10.246
Oh, go in peace, my angel!

04:14.320 --> 04:17.414
Queen Beryl, I have failed to bring you
Sailor Moon's life force.

04:17.457 --> 04:21.154
You fool!
Your utter incompetence is dwarfed...

04:21.194 --> 04:24.095
only by your sheer stupidity.
Ew!

04:24.130 --> 04:29.193
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry, your majesty. I just...
I kind of like it when you yell at me.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.533
It's hot.

04:44.684 --> 04:46.549
It's my job to provide a bridge...

04:46.586 --> 04:48.486
between the blokes
at the top of the ladder...

04:48.521 --> 04:50.785
like Cobra Commander and Serpentor...

04:50.823 --> 04:52.552
and the peons at the bottom.

04:52.592 --> 04:55.993
I help the peons feel valuable...

04:56.029 --> 04:58.589
although it helps
not to call them peons.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.258
Here's that report you wanted, sir.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.428
I told you not to staple it, wretch!

05:04.871 --> 05:06.395
So, I'm the bridge.

05:06.439 --> 05:10.569
Yeah. Cloning is an integral part
of Cobra's plan for world domination.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.407
- Hail Cobra!
- Hail Cobra.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.845
Basically, my job
is to defrag the DNA sequencer...

05:14.881 --> 05:17.281
before each cloning
and juice the capacitor...

05:17.317 --> 05:19.512
- Hail Cobra!
- Hail Cobra.

05:19.552 --> 05:22.885
And monitor the plasma feed.
I started out in accounting...

05:22.922 --> 05:25.220
but there's a lot more room
for advancement down here.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.226
- Bail Nobra!
- Bail Nobr... oh.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.421
Oh, hang on a second.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.726
Yeah. Well, you know, establishing
the Cobra brand name...

05:31.764 --> 05:35.996
is a priority for us, so we put
the Cobra logo on just about everything.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.663
Hey, safety is job one here at Cobra.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.536
We fully comply with OSHA standards.

05:40.573 --> 05:43.508
It's been thirty-four days
since our last on-site accident.

05:43.543 --> 05:49.277
The weather dominator exploded,
and, uh, we lost about 110 guys.

05:49.315 --> 05:53.718
You can still kind of see what's left
of Scott Anderson up there.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.347
We really should get that down.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.084
You know, we've been
chucking a softball at it...

05:58.124 --> 05:59.751
but it's up there pretty good.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.317
Interoffice romances are strictly forbidden.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.421
There's a very good reason for that.

06:04.464 --> 06:05.897
They're a distraction.

06:05.932 --> 06:09.129
They cut down on productivity,
and they always end badly.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.795
Bwah ha ha ha!

06:10.837 --> 06:13.635
Training and reeducation
isn't just about combat.

06:13.673 --> 06:16.870
It's also about learning
the whole Cobra mind set.

06:16.909 --> 06:21.107
OK. Let's say you want to take out
the G.I. Joe quickly and quietly...

06:21.147 --> 06:23.672
without alerting
the other members of his unit.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.616
Oh. I'd use a gas pellet.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.243
You're on the right track.

06:27.286 --> 06:31.882
Um, I'd weave, like, a wicker basket
and construct a robot snake in it...

06:31.924 --> 06:33.619
that, like, shoots gas out of its mouth.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.286
Excellent. Anyone else?

06:35.328 --> 06:37.660
Oh, well, I'd totally do what Frank said...

06:37.697 --> 06:40.825
with the basket and all,
but I'd also yell, "Cobra!"

06:40.867 --> 06:42.994
- Perfect.
- Now I know.

06:43.035 --> 06:44.662
And knowing is half the battle!

06:46.139 --> 06:48.334
Date rape! Date rape!

06:48.374 --> 06:50.808
Date rape! Date rape!

06:50.843 --> 06:53.573
Soon, I will have
your life force, Sailor Moon...

06:53.613 --> 06:57.606
and my plan to rule the earth
will come to fruition.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.550
Ooh.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.986
Anime sure is weird.

07:03.022 --> 07:06.617
Ray Charles, you talented,
but you ruined my life!

07:06.659 --> 07:09.822
Coming next Christmas...
<i>Ray 2: Ray's Day Out.</i>

07:09.862 --> 07:13.263
Just like you ruined
so many women before me.

07:13.299 --> 07:17.497
It's not your fault your little brother
fell into that washtub and drowned.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.437
You got to face your problems.

07:19.472 --> 07:20.837
Ow!

07:20.873 --> 07:23.137
Damn!

07:23.176 --> 07:27.476
Ray! My back's broken!
Oh, God, Ray!

07:27.513 --> 07:30.607
You blind son of a bitch!

07:30.650 --> 07:34.780
You killed me, Ray!
You blind son of a bitch!

07:34.821 --> 07:35.947
Waah!

07:35.988 --> 07:38.957
<i>Ray 2: Ray's Day Out...</i>
<i>coming next Christmas.</i>

07:48.234 --> 07:49.758
Haw haw!

07:50.770 --> 07:51.998
Haw haw!

07:55.107 --> 07:58.838
Tonight, the top ten things
Eddie Buttskin should never say.

07:58.878 --> 07:59.902
Number ten...

07:59.946 --> 08:02.380
If you die, could I have your room?

08:02.415 --> 08:04.280
Number nine...

08:04.317 --> 08:07.753
Me so horny. Me love you long time.

08:07.787 --> 08:08.845
Number eight...

08:08.888 --> 08:11.152
There's blood when I wipe.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.418
Number seven...

08:12.458 --> 08:15.256
I'm going to eat your face on TV,
David Letterman.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.091
Wait. That's kind of specific.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.654
Aah! Aah!

08:19.699 --> 08:21.394
Oh, God, help me! Oh, God!

08:21.434 --> 08:23.925
Aah! Aah! Aah!

08:28.941 --> 08:30.408
Mmm.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.603
Ahh.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.543
Ha ha! OK. OK, guys. That's a lot of...

08:34.580 --> 08:35.945
Hey, quit it. Hey, get off.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.745
Hey, you guys, stop it!
Come on! Stop!

08:40.653 --> 08:44.384
Is everyone ready
for some hilarious home videos?

08:45.424 --> 08:48.552
We here at <i>Bloopers</i> central
asked you to send in your tapes...

08:48.594 --> 08:51.893
so we can produce this show
for almost nothing.

08:51.931 --> 08:56.129
We thought we'd see nut shots
and seniors falling down...

08:56.168 --> 09:00.366
but these tragedies
kicked it up a notch... bam!

09:00.406 --> 09:01.737
Did I say, "Bam"?

09:01.774 --> 09:04.265
Let's hope, for this guy's sake,
that I didn't.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.574
- Move it, Pop!
- Out of the way, old man!

09:06.612 --> 09:08.079
Move your ass, damn it!

09:08.114 --> 09:09.274
Go! Whoo hoo!

09:09.315 --> 09:10.475
Now we're going!

09:15.922 --> 09:19.016
Ha ha ha! That's what you get.
Oh!

09:19.058 --> 09:22.653
And they say you can't solve
the homeless problem.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.390
Some problems can't be solved...

09:24.430 --> 09:27.524
by sticking you nose in
where it doesn't belong.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.536
- Honey, be careful.
- Shut up.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.038
Maybe a mechanic could fix it better.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.200
I can do it if you'd just shut up.

09:37.610 --> 09:38.668
Mama, I'm pregnant.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.440
- No!
- No!

09:40.479 --> 09:43.642
Hey, she told me she was on the pill.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.446
And eighteen.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.611
Hidden cameras can yield
cherished memories...

09:47.653 --> 09:50.178
or incriminating evidence.

09:50.222 --> 09:53.248
The only X-factor is you.

09:53.292 --> 09:55.783
- What are you doing, sweetie?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.762
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.230
Ohh... huhh!

09:59.265 --> 10:01.756
Oh, god! Oh, I'm sorry.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.235
You... ing loser!

10:04.270 --> 10:09.071
You have failed me as a boyfriend,
and you have failed yourself as a man...

10:09.108 --> 10:12.805
<i>Robot Chicken</i> co-head writer
Douglas Goldstein!

10:12.845 --> 10:14.142
Bet you didn't see that coming.

10:14.180 --> 10:18.048
Matter of fact, neither did she.

10:18.084 --> 10:21.520
This video was sent in
by someone who found it in the woods.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.317
Let's watch.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.323
- Josh!
- Michael!

10:24.357 --> 10:26.689
- I'm coming, Josh!
- Wait for me, Michael!

10:26.726 --> 10:29.957
Michael, wait for me! Michael!

10:29.996 --> 10:32.157
Aah!

10:33.165 --> 10:37.033
Rumor has it,
those kids were torn limb from limb.

10:37.069 --> 10:41.938
Sometimes the best home videos
can be taken away from home.

10:41.974 --> 10:45.933
Just watch these crazy vacation videos.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.741
Blaagh!

11:09.435 --> 11:11.528
That's all the time we have
for this episode...

11:11.570 --> 11:16.303
so come back next week
for more hilarious home videos.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.627
- Ba-gawk!
- Bock.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.839
Stupid monkey.
