Hello?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.324
Millie Morris?

00:33.325 --> 00:34.785
Who is this?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.331
Look outside your door.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.126
Who the fuck is this?

00:42.168 --> 00:44.170
Merry Christmas.

- Should we tell the others?

02:56.552 --> 02:59.138
Tell the others? No.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.347
No.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.309
This is from the Shlieffle file.

03:05.978 --> 03:09.773
They deserve to bloody know
what happened here.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.610
What, then? You didn't hear me?

03:14.612 --> 03:17.990
I wasn't clear?

03:18.032 --> 03:22.202
They will know
when I need them to know.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.204
Not before.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.540
We'll salvage it all.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.792

One more, Safta. Please?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.515
Tell me the one of you and Saba.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.726
- Again, kindelah?
- Please?

03:45.768 --> 03:47.269
Okay.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.480
But then, bedtime.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.566
I mean it, Jonah.

03:52.608 --> 03:57.404
Once upon a time,
there was a princess.

03:57.446 --> 04:02.493
And she loved to laugh and swim
with her sister Chava.

04:02.534 --> 04:06.914
And then, one day,
a scary wolf king came

04:06.956 --> 04:09.124
and he captured her
and her sister

04:09.166 --> 04:13.379
and he took them
to his fortress in the forest.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.094
And he kept them there
for a very long time.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.262
And then it was
no more laughing,

04:22.304 --> 04:24.473
there was no more smiling

04:24.515 --> 04:28.602
and not even enough food
for everybody.

04:28.644 --> 04:32.314
One by one, the wolf king's
army took away

04:32.356 --> 04:35.776
all the other prisoners,
even the princess's sister,

04:35.818 --> 04:38.779
until no one was left but her.

04:38.821 --> 04:42.741
And once she was alone,
that wolf king

04:42.783 --> 04:45.995
tried to win her heart
by giving her gifts,

04:46.036 --> 04:49.373
but she wouldn't take
nothing from him.

04:49.415 --> 04:54.795
And she just grew sadder
and sadder and more lonely.

04:54.837 --> 05:00.009
But then, one day,
some fairy helpers appeared.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.639
- And the wolf king
was so afraid

05:05.681 --> 05:09.643
that he ran away
and no one saw him ever again.

05:09.685 --> 05:15.024
And then, she saw him,
a brave green knight

05:15.065 --> 05:18.444
who was the leader,
the king of the fairy helpers.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.280
- Saba.
- That's right, Jonah.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.491
He nursed her back to health
and he promised to protect her

05:24.533 --> 05:29.246
and take her to a land where
the wolf king would never go.

05:29.288 --> 05:34.710
And she knew that he loved her
and she loved him.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.712
And he's in heaven with Mommy?

05:36.754 --> 05:39.381
Yes. And I'm here

05:39.423 --> 05:43.218
with the best present ever.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.471
- Me.
- That's right.

05:45.512 --> 05:49.141
Her sweet little boy Jonah.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.143
The end.

05:51.185 --> 05:55.606
And now, it is shluffy time.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.299

birth certificate.

that my safta and Meyer

06:36.522 --> 06:38.107
had a "complicated"
relationship.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.484
What's more complicated
than, u-uh,

06:40.526 --> 06:42.319
knocking someone up and bailing?

Do me a favor. Quit crying like
you're a junior mitzvah scout

06:45.447 --> 06:47.866

06:47.908 --> 06:52.830
We got más grande shit
on our plato, hombre.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.415
Like this día de... doom.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.960

If The Ghost worked for the Army

07:01.213 --> 07:03.340
this place has got

07:04.383 --> 07:05.926
And you're not calling anyone.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.886
All you're gonna do
is sit your ass in this van

07:07.928 --> 07:09.304
and keep the engine running.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.515
Sweet. Yeah. I'm the wheelman.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.933
You're not the wheelman.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.535
You're the guy who waits
in a parked car

07:14.560 --> 07:16.770
and makes sure no one takes it.

07:20.691 --> 07:23.986

fucking wheelman.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.039
O-Oh.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.686
Couldn't have lifted
those sanctions

07:39.710 --> 07:41.587
without you, Mr. President.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.507
Biff has got something
up his sleeve.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.926
I know it.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.554
You've still got a marker
with our friend at The Post.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.764
If Biff's hiding something,
she'll find it.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.892
She can dig up anything.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.021
Make the call.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.306
He has to eat, too, doesn't he?

08:36.558 --> 08:39.144
Why? He's gonna die anyway.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.647
Hmm?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.983
But he has to live
long enough to suffer.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.277
You said it yourself.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.321
And I meant it.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.200
He's gonna die a horrible death.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.415
He's gonna pay
for what he did to Aaron.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.835
How?

09:07.714 --> 09:09.716
H-How?

09:11.677 --> 09:14.638
You know, 34 years I've been
dreaming about this day,

09:14.680 --> 09:18.517
but I-I... I never got that far.

09:29.194 --> 09:32.990
My ex stopped bringing
the kids around.

I needed help.

- I'll go.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.600
What brought you here today?

10:01.643 --> 10:03.729
What brought any of us here?

10:03.770 --> 10:06.231
I'm in pain, Sarge.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.567
Can't sleep.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.778
Can't get Charlie
out of my head.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.575
It's almost like I...
like I miss it.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
Is that sick?

10:18.660 --> 10:20.120
We've all been there.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.789
Haven't we, fellas?

10:22.831 --> 10:26.418
Ugh, I just... just want
to feel alive again.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.920
You know? Like I did
when I was tiptoeing

10:28.962 --> 10:31.548
through that minefield
in Khe Sanh.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.552
Or watching that napalm strike
from a hilltop in Hue.

10:35.594 --> 10:39.389
And the silence
we heard right after.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.309
You know what we call that?

10:42.351 --> 10:46.730
The deafening quiet
after our boys rain hellfire

10:46.772 --> 10:51.360
down on Charlie
like a Louisiana deluge?

10:51.401 --> 10:55.030
We call it the death spiral.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.074
Hold up.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.785
- Man, I've heard
that story before.
- You'll get your turn.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.787
We all have.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.288
It's from Death Spiral 2.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.374
- That's right.
- Yeah.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.250
Got to be honest, fellas,
didn't think

11:07.292 --> 11:08.668
anyone had actually
seen that one.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.504
Not in this country, at least.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.383
I'm Lonny Flash.
Thank you for your service.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.426
Is this some kind
of joke to you?

11:16.468 --> 11:18.428
Just researching a role,
meant no offense.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.305
Lee Strasberg would've
done the same thing.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.225
Man, get the fuck out of here.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.561
There's no silence
after a napalm strike.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.606
Just screams.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.486
Anyone who's ever seen one
up close would know that.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.247
We were patrolling a village
along the Mekong

11:45.288 --> 11:47.040
when we came under fire.

11:47.082 --> 11:50.752
VC all along the tree line.

11:50.794 --> 11:54.589
I got separated
from the platoon.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.634
The other guys pulled back
and my LT called in the nape.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.806
When the smoke cleared,

12:02.848 --> 12:05.892
there was this little girl,

12:05.934 --> 12:11.148
maybe six, burned,

12:11.189 --> 12:14.943
holding her arms out,
begging to be picked up.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.822
I tried to help her.

12:18.864 --> 12:23.243
Her skin peeled off in my hands.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.662
Wasn't till later I realized...

12:26.705 --> 12:30.542
she didn't want to be held.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.003
She just wanted to be
put out of her misery.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.673
And so...

12:39.301 --> 12:40.927
I did.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.640
She needed a weapon.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.021
I was it.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.488
Thanks for sharing.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.548
You're back
in the world now, man.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.615
Exactly.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.388
Don't make me regret this...

14:12.477 --> 14:13.687
Thank you.

14:13.728 --> 14:14.729
You're welcome.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.415
You are a decent man.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.167
- I can tell...
- Not another word.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.920
I know who you are...

14:38.962 --> 14:40.589
- Ah...
- You are the Markowitzes.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.424
Enough!

14:42.465 --> 14:44.634
Your boy. Aaron was his name?

14:44.676 --> 14:46.094
- Shut up.
- You let him go.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.470
You broke your promise to him.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.180
Die!

14:49.222 --> 14:51.099
Die!

14:51.141 --> 14:52.642
Die!

14:52.684 --> 14:54.269
Die now!
Die!

15:10.076 --> 15:12.370
Mindy?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.164
And the Jews

15:14.205 --> 15:17.626
smote their enemies

15:17.667 --> 15:20.879
with the stroke of the sword,

15:20.920 --> 15:26.343
and with slaughter
and destruction.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.054
They did as they wished....

15:29.095 --> 15:30.138
No, no. No, please!

15:30.180 --> 15:31.598
- No!
- To those

15:31.640 --> 15:33.683
who...

15:33.725 --> 15:36.311
hated them!

15:40.106 --> 15:42.400
Your son.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.818
He's watching.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.987

Okay, come on in, have a seat.

16:11.096 --> 16:14.599
I'm poking around, Morris,
but it's gonna take some time.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.601
And if your source
is telling the truth,

16:16.643 --> 16:18.728
I'm hard-pressed to believe
that anyone I talk to is

16:18.770 --> 16:20.164
gonna be forthcoming about
covering up the greatest

16:20.188 --> 16:21.898
mass conspiracy
in our nation's history.

16:21.940 --> 16:22.982
Hm.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.319
We may not need them to.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.821
That crusty white guy

16:27.862 --> 16:29.864
is Heinz Richter, the toymaker.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.950
- Someone was surveilling him.
- Yeah.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.827
All this showed up
on my doorstep

16:33.868 --> 16:37.580
with a note saying that it was
taken from Offerman's place.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.832
Well...

16:38.873 --> 16:40.500
They send a return address?

16:40.542 --> 16:42.961
We need to send these good
Samaritans a fruit basket.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.254
This is real, boss.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.297
Judge is gonna love
hearing that.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.983
'Cause that's what you're
asking for, right?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.009
You want a warrant to go
after Meyer Offerman,

16:50.051 --> 16:51.761
based on this
trove of information

16:51.803 --> 16:53.471
that magically turned up
at your door.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.265
I know a murder charge
won't stick,

16:55.306 --> 16:57.142
but there's a lot more
where this came from.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.560
Richter, the Fishers...

16:58.601 --> 17:00.520
Offerman's clearly
working off a list.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.790
And if we get the government
to come clean about Paperclip,

17:02.814 --> 17:04.274
maybe we can get Offerman to.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.820
I just need to get
into his house...

17:08.862 --> 17:12.741
find his files, and then
I can bust this thing open.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.577
Well, those no way you can
legally get inside his house.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.832
Okay.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.626
But... that doesn't mean

17:23.668 --> 17:26.045
you can't get inside his house.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.176
You know how it's done,
don't you?

17:31.217 --> 17:34.888
You get creative with the truth.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.974
You tell the judge
what he needs to hear.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.727
And you get...

17:40.769 --> 17:43.146
comfortable
with being uncomfortable

17:43.188 --> 17:45.690
with your conscience.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.108
Best agents around here,

17:47.150 --> 17:49.569
they do what it takes.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.155
Others put in 20 years,

17:52.197 --> 17:55.408
get a pension.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.744
Question is, Millie...

17:57.786 --> 17:59.537
which one are you?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.670
I feel like he's here.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.422
Who?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.758
Aaron.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.094
I feel like he's watching us.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.433
If he sees us, Murray,

18:20.475 --> 18:22.894
what would he think?

18:26.356 --> 18:28.525
That man...

18:28.566 --> 18:30.193
robbed us.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.237
That man...

18:34.364 --> 18:36.783
robbed us of our beautiful boy.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.828
And I'm gonna kill him.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.082
So, this revenge we seek,

18:44.123 --> 18:48.211
is it for Aaron?

18:48.253 --> 18:50.755
Or is it for us?

18:57.303 --> 19:00.014
I'm gonna do it tonight,
and it'll be done.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.190
Whatever we do, we do together.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.613
Yeah.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.116
According to his file,

19:18.157 --> 19:20.076
Timothy Randall lives with

19:20.118 --> 19:21.536
someone named Una Randall.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.767
If this shit's going down today,
you really think

19:26.791 --> 19:28.501
we're gonna find some guy
whose nickname

19:28.543 --> 19:30.295
is The fucking Ghost?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.088
Holed up in some
lily-white suburb

19:32.130 --> 19:35.508
ripping silent-but-deadlies
in his fucking La-Z-Boy?

19:35.550 --> 19:37.927
Eichmann wasn't
in some Argentinian mansion.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.388
When they found him,
he was working in a factory,

19:40.430 --> 19:42.223
living in a shack.

19:42.265 --> 19:45.476
Oh, shit, we have movement.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.438
Yep, probably our girl Una.

19:48.479 --> 19:51.232
Mid to late 50s, blond.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.192
Looks like it could be
his daughter.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.779
Either that,
or Cheryl Ladd's stand-in.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.491
Actually, Cheryl Ladd's stand-in

20:00.533 --> 20:02.285
has tits like vanilla ice cream.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.203
And I know...

20:04.245 --> 20:06.706
'cause I had two scoops.

20:06.748 --> 20:07.933
Let's go find The fucking Ghost.

Doesn't look like him.

Dieter said they were

23:36.958 --> 23:38.292
working something big.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.436
They made biological weapons

23:39.460 --> 23:41.170
at Edgewood.

Maybe this guy
is his test subject.

Behind his ears.

24:12.493 --> 24:15.246
Half the widows on Rodeo
got these tiger stripes.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.874
Plastic surgery.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.803
Nine fingers.

24:32.889 --> 24:36.267
This is him.

24:36.309 --> 24:40.062
Maybe the plastic surgery
was to help him disappear.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.694
Did you have a good time? Ja?

24:49.655 --> 24:51.949
- Don't move!
Don't fucking move! Stop!

24:51.991 --> 24:53.927
Calm down,
take whatever you want.
- Don't fucking move.

24:53.951 --> 24:55.453
Please don't hurt us!

24:55.494 --> 24:57.330

25:00.499 --> 25:01.459
- What happened?
- Shit.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.336
- What happened?!
- She had a fucking kid

25:03.377 --> 25:04.396
- in her arms!
- What the fuck?

25:04.420 --> 25:05.504
What the fuck?!

25:10.885 --> 25:13.137
Shit.

25:16.557 --> 25:20.645
With a backswing, you'll
pull it all over the place.

25:20.686 --> 25:24.190
Now, I'm telling you, fellas,
it's all about wrist strength.

25:24.232 --> 25:27.193
Actually, Pete,
isn't your Kori pregnant?

25:27.235 --> 25:29.737
Hell, you'll be
scratch in no time.

25:31.239 --> 25:32.490
Biff Simpson.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.242
Josie Parker, Washington Post.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.719
I'm writing a piece
on Carter lifting

25:35.743 --> 25:36.887
the South American sanctions.

25:36.911 --> 25:39.080
And this one's above the fold.

25:39.121 --> 25:41.499
Guess I'll see you fellas later.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.001
And now, uh,

25:44.043 --> 25:46.379
Miss Parker, is it?

25:46.420 --> 25:48.422
You were about to ask me about

25:48.464 --> 25:51.133
a stellar piece of legislation.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.593
Actually, I was
gonna ask you about

25:52.635 --> 25:54.053
your connection
to Schidler Corp....

25:54.095 --> 25:55.680
A South American corporation?

25:55.721 --> 25:58.891
You attended the past
three Schidler corporate

25:58.933 --> 26:00.935
retreats... gave the keynote
at the last one.

26:00.977 --> 26:04.563
Uh, where I convinced them
to set up shop right here.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.066
Create American jobs.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.694
Well, I'm impressed
with your patriotism.

26:09.735 --> 26:13.281
But I have to ask,
what else was in it for you?

26:13.322 --> 26:15.175
That bill was on life support,
then my source says

26:15.199 --> 26:17.159
you bulldozed your colleagues
to bring it home.

26:17.201 --> 26:20.079
I'd be wary about trusting
that source of yours.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.831
Juanita is sensitive.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.666
It affects her credibility.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.126
Fact remains,

26:25.167 --> 26:26.794
you're awfully cozy
with the company

26:26.836 --> 26:29.338
set to profit most
from lifting the ban.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.007
I got a "C" in Latin,

26:31.048 --> 26:33.092
but I'm pretty sure if I dig,

26:33.134 --> 26:35.970
I might find a quid pro quo.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.638
You won't.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.016
And I don't need the heartburn.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.060
Juanita is old news.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.104
F-Forget this...

26:45.146 --> 26:47.231
and I'll give you
access to the Oval.

26:48.733 --> 26:51.986
Hmm, you'll be above
the fold every day.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.199
Thing is, Biff.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.035
Carter's gonna have you
out on your ass

26:59.076 --> 27:00.786
the second this hits the stands.

27:05.374 --> 27:09.086
They say you Orientals
are good at math.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.672
And this...

27:11.714 --> 27:14.258
it isn't gonna add up
to anything good for you.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.844
Kill the story.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.771
We grabbed what we could.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.230
His face was different.

27:28.272 --> 27:29.607
Scarred up by surgery.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.984
But I'm telling you, it was him.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.611
It seems The Ghost got himself

27:33.652 --> 27:35.589
a brand-new look that
wouldn't get him recognized.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.948
And Jonah found a music box

27:37.990 --> 27:39.700
right next to The Ghost's
AM/FM radio.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.494
Playing a similar
creepy-ass tune

27:41.535 --> 27:43.621
to the one we heard
at Holstedder's.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.414
I think I figured it out.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.291
The code. Come on!

27:48.667 --> 27:50.127
Murray and Mindy couldn't

27:50.169 --> 27:52.296
crack the code
because they-they,

27:52.338 --> 27:54.715
they didn't have the cipher...
The notes from the music box

27:54.757 --> 27:56.401
are the exact same as
the notes from the lullaby,

27:56.425 --> 27:58.465
only they're organized
in different time signatures.

27:59.637 --> 28:00.638
Ten years of piano

28:00.679 --> 28:01.680
with Nettie Zuckerman.

28:01.722 --> 28:04.016
It's a polymeter.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.352
This is why we found the music
box next to the radio.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.437
The-the lullaby 's in 3/4 time,

28:08.479 --> 28:10.940
the music box is in 4/4,
therefore,

28:10.981 --> 28:12.542
if you play them together,
they sound completely off.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.002
But every fourth measure
of the lullaby

28:14.026 --> 28:16.821
lines up exactly
with the music box.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.115
Yeah, I failed "Do Re Mi" math,

28:19.156 --> 28:20.616
so can we speak English?

28:20.658 --> 28:23.911
The music box is the key to

28:23.953 --> 28:26.414
understanding the code.
Murray said that

28:26.455 --> 28:28.433
the Morse Code following
the dates was just a bunch

28:28.457 --> 28:30.626
of gibberish, but if we only
pay attention to the parts

28:30.668 --> 28:33.087
of the code where
the measures of the music box

28:33.129 --> 28:34.672
and the lullaby overlap,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.799
this is what you get.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.300
Coordinates.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.345
Good, good.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.097
Thank you, Lonny.

28:43.139 --> 28:45.516
Thank you.

28:45.558 --> 28:49.103
All right, if the coordinates
are correct,

28:49.145 --> 28:52.314
the targets are in Buchanan

28:52.356 --> 28:55.985
and right by

28:56.026 --> 28:57.820
Grand Central Station.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.531
I've messengered that blood
sample to a friend at Columbia.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.092
It's going to take
a few days to analyze,

29:02.116 --> 29:04.076
but she thinks that
Joe could be right.

29:04.118 --> 29:06.787
It's likely we're dealing
with a biological weapon.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.372
If that's the case,
even a small amount

29:08.414 --> 29:10.040
in a crowded area would...

29:10.082 --> 29:11.417
If this is going down tonight,

29:11.459 --> 29:12.894
we're going to need
Murray and Mindy.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.420
And Roxy, too.

29:14.462 --> 29:15.588
- No.
- Joe...

29:15.629 --> 29:16.922
Leave her out of this.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.757
Joe, go get her, come on.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.551
Come on.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.428
She may be done with The Hunt.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.555
But The Hunt
isn't done with her.

29:24.597 --> 29:28.225
It's an order...
You want me to say it?

29:28.267 --> 29:31.562
I'll deal with Mindy and Murray,
all right?

29:31.604 --> 29:33.606
Yes.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.779
Hey, wait.

29:40.821 --> 29:44.783
Why, uh, why weren't you
in the story?

29:44.825 --> 29:47.369
What? What story?

29:47.411 --> 29:50.456
My safta used to tell me
a story when I was a kid.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.458
It was The Princess
& The Green Knight.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.269
It was her way of telling me
how she survived the war,

29:54.293 --> 29:55.669
how she met my grandfather.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.172
But you... you weren't
mentioned in it.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.675
This guy was.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.302
This guy.

30:03.344 --> 30:05.387
- Yeah...
- Nathaniel Heidelbaum.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.223
-Yes.
-All right?
He was one of the G.I.s

30:07.264 --> 30:10.226
- at the DP camp.
- Yes, he was very good to her.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.269
And to us.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.105
- He was.
- He wasn't my grandfather,
was he?

30:15.147 --> 30:17.900
No.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.944
No. No.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.991
That's because you are.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.451
Am I right?

30:28.702 --> 30:30.913
Come on, tell me.
Tell me, please.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.752
Y-Yes. Yes, uh...

30:42.424 --> 30:45.511
- I am.
- Why? Why? Why?

30:45.553 --> 30:47.638
- Why what?
- Why-why d-didn't you want me

30:47.680 --> 30:49.682
to know who my grandfather was?

30:49.723 --> 30:52.101
Why was it better for me
to not know that you existed?

30:52.142 --> 30:53.561
Why lie to me?

30:53.602 --> 30:56.230
No, no, no, no, no.
She didn't lie to you.

30:56.272 --> 30:59.191
She lied for you.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.610
There's a difference.

31:01.652 --> 31:04.238
She was protecting you.

31:04.280 --> 31:09.368
A lie, sometimes,
is a very unselfish act.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.078
- Sometimes we tell...
- Sir.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.706
- What?
- The FBI is here.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.133
Put your fucking gun down now!

31:24.174 --> 31:27.595
Stop! Stop! Stop.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.724
Please.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.271
Now...

31:39.398 --> 31:41.650
what can I help you with?

31:41.692 --> 31:44.695
I have a warrant
to search the premises.

31:44.737 --> 31:45.904
Right.

31:48.616 --> 31:49.992
Baruch haba.

31:50.034 --> 31:52.161
Fan out, upstairs.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.413
You're with me.

31:54.455 --> 31:56.749
I was really hoping I wouldn't
see you here, Jonah.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.467
And where does this go?

32:06.508 --> 32:08.719
- The attic.
- Oh, what's in the attic?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.680
Ghosts.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.807
Show me some ghosts.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.947
It's, uh...
No, it's to your left.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.991
Here.

32:45.673 --> 32:50.177
Like I said, there's nothing
of interest in here.

32:50.219 --> 32:53.055
Looks like there
was a fire in here.

32:53.097 --> 32:54.848
And a recent one, too.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.726
- Yes, there was a, uh...

32:57.768 --> 33:00.229
what is a... oil lamp... fell.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.231
Poof.

33:02.272 --> 33:04.566
Led to fire...

33:06.360 --> 33:10.989
But clumsiness, that's not a
crime, is it, uh, Agent Morris?

33:21.041 --> 33:22.334
Meyer Offerman,

33:22.376 --> 33:24.628
you're under arrest
for the murder of Heinz Richter.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.231
- Hey, hey... No. No, no.
- You have the right
to remain silent.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.691
- You can't fucking do this.
- Anything you say can and will

33:27.715 --> 33:29.275
- be used against you...
- You have no right...

33:29.299 --> 33:31.760
- Jonah... Jonah, please.
- He's telling the truth.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.613
- Excuse us, Jonah.
- No. They have no right
to do this.

33:33.637 --> 33:35.222
- See to your business.
- Excuse us.

33:35.264 --> 33:37.641
How is this legal?
How is this fucking legal?

33:37.683 --> 33:40.686
Excuse us, Jonah.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.647
This is fucking bullshit.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.109
I said no more
disturbances today.

33:47.151 --> 33:48.694
There's a reporter on the line.

33:48.736 --> 33:50.529
A Josie Parker
from The Washington Post.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.948
Something about Biff Simpson.

33:54.992 --> 33:56.201
Put it through.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.562
- Katarina Low.
- This is Josie Parker from The Post.

34:05.586 --> 34:06.855
We're doing a story
about Biff Simpson...

34:06.879 --> 34:08.839
I see.

34:08.881 --> 34:12.843
Uh, n-no, in-in that case,
uh, my official statement

34:12.885 --> 34:15.345
is, uh,
Biff Simpson is a patriot.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.806
And we at Schidler Corp.
Are grateful for his service

34:17.848 --> 34:19.600
and proud to call him friend.

34:19.641 --> 34:21.602
No, that's all I have to say.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.562
Thank you.

34:32.279 --> 34:35.240
862. Yeah, we have a problem.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.867
Uh, let me rephrase.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.203
Simpson's got one.

34:47.544 --> 34:50.714
Who are you? Why am I here?

34:50.756 --> 34:52.549
Huh?

34:52.591 --> 34:55.886
Huh? W-Who the hell
are you people?

34:55.928 --> 34:57.930
Huh?

35:01.016 --> 35:02.226
Your name...

35:03.852 --> 35:06.104
Your name is Moritz Ehrlich.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.733
You were the Kommandant

35:09.775 --> 35:13.237
sorting new arrivals
at Auschwitz-Birkenau

35:13.278 --> 35:18.408
on the morning
of 18th March, 1943.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.496
You leveled your Luger
at a boy that day.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.748
Shot him point-blank.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.375
No. No!

35:26.416 --> 35:28.836
Yeah, you tore him
from the arms of his father

35:28.877 --> 35:30.587
and you shot him dead.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.508
That boy, he was our son.

35:34.550 --> 35:37.761
He cried so much...

35:37.803 --> 35:41.139
I'm not the man
who did this to your child.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.519
I saw it...

35:46.395 --> 35:49.982
With my own eyes.

35:54.278 --> 35:58.073
My eyes.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.951
I am the witness.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.379
Well, tell me you remember.

36:12.421 --> 36:15.257
I don't. It wasn't me.

36:15.299 --> 36:18.677
His name...

36:18.719 --> 36:23.098
was Aaron Efraim Markowitz.

36:24.558 --> 36:27.519
He loved riding on the horses

36:27.561 --> 36:30.689
with his cousins from Lublin.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.691
And watercolors.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.903
He loved watercolors.

36:35.944 --> 36:39.531
And music. Klezmer music.

36:39.573 --> 36:42.409
And he liked to read...
Loved to read.

36:42.451 --> 36:45.662
Especially the stories...

36:48.081 --> 36:51.168
the stories about
the Seven Wonders of the World.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.588
He loved that.

36:54.630 --> 36:58.091
Did you know that
when you pulled the trigger?

36:58.133 --> 37:01.053
- Nein.
- Nein.

37:01.094 --> 37:04.222
He was a human being

37:04.264 --> 37:07.976
w-with hopes

37:08.018 --> 37:13.440
and dreams
and love in his heart.

37:14.691 --> 37:17.194
And you can't even remember

37:17.235 --> 37:20.280
firing the shot.

37:20.322 --> 37:23.533
No... No, it's not true...

37:23.575 --> 37:25.369
No, no, no. Mindy. Mindy.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.971
He doesn't deserve to...
Doesn't deserve,

37:26.995 --> 37:29.206
doesn't deserve
to know our pain.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.749
Doesn't deserve it.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.877
Finish it already, Murray.
Finish!

37:41.635 --> 37:42.844
Wait.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.262
Don't shoot.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.807
I remember now. Please.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.016
Please.

37:48.058 --> 37:51.728
He was auburn-haired boy

37:51.770 --> 37:55.232
with a cherubic face
and a little scar on his chin.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.652
- Shoot, Murray.
- I remember.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.320
We couldn't tear him away.

38:00.362 --> 38:04.616
Four guards tried,
but you wouldn't let us.

38:04.658 --> 38:09.329
You held him long past
the moment of his death.

38:11.999 --> 38:14.584
Please.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.800
I can't do it. I can't...

38:22.843 --> 38:25.012
Why?

38:25.053 --> 38:27.764
Uh, no, no, no.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.850
- Please. Please.
- Mindy.

38:29.891 --> 38:32.060
Murray, please.

38:34.354 --> 38:35.754
No, stop. You don't
have to do this.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.651
Mindy! Murray!

38:41.737 --> 38:43.739
Hello?!

38:46.033 --> 38:47.409
Open up. It's Jonah.

38:47.451 --> 38:50.412
- Wait. Be careful. Careful.
- Mindy.

38:50.454 --> 38:51.830
- Careful.
- Murray.

38:51.872 --> 38:54.833
- Come on.
- That's Jonah?

38:54.875 --> 38:56.543
-Careful.
-What's going on?
-The feds.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.045
The feds, they got Meyer.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.796
Someone tried
to burn down the Ark.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.190
- Shit's going down.
- Just, just, just...

39:01.214 --> 39:02.591
- Tonight.
- Slow down.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.472
- Start over.
- Listen, uh, I cracked the code.

39:04.509 --> 39:08.096
The Nazis, all right,
they're going to release

39:08.138 --> 39:10.515
a biological weapon
in the city tonight.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.517
I-I'll get my tools.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.519
Come on, we got to go.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.150
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.152
Uh...

39:22.194 --> 39:24.196
Yeah.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.372
How you doing, Rox?

39:38.460 --> 39:39.836
Hi.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.840
You're little.

39:45.342 --> 39:47.761
Wasn't picturing her so little.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.387
Sweetie, why don't
you head on in?

39:49.429 --> 39:52.641
Mommy is right behind you. Okay?

39:56.436 --> 39:58.772
What are you doing here, Joe?

39:58.814 --> 40:00.857
Now, I made myself pretty clear.
I'm out.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.859
They got
a biological weapon, Rox.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.278
That's what it's all been about.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.572
The radios, the Red Books.

40:07.614 --> 40:09.950
- Meyer asked me
to come to you...
- Joe.

40:09.991 --> 40:12.869
I'm not going back.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.288
I'm not asking you to.

40:15.330 --> 40:19.000
I'm here to tell you
that it's going down tonight.

40:21.336 --> 40:25.006
You need to take your
little girl, leave the city.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.307
Hey, Joe.

40:36.726 --> 40:39.146
Thank you.

40:52.284 --> 40:55.537
At first, Gretel Fischer

40:55.579 --> 40:57.914
looked like she slipped
in the shower.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.750
Until I figured out
she was gassed.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.752
And her brother, Hans.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.421
Died in a car crash,
but not before

41:04.462 --> 41:06.089
someone ripped out his teeth.

41:06.131 --> 41:11.178
And after them,
came Heinz Richter.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.889
This one's a little sloppier,

41:13.930 --> 41:15.170
almost as if a teenager did it.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.477
You take
his training wheels off?

41:19.519 --> 41:23.356
You show him the ropes
of Murder 101?

41:25.233 --> 41:27.194
Leave the boy out of this.

41:27.235 --> 41:30.030
Why? You're the one
that jammed him up.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.616
You bailed him out of jail,
took him in.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.452
I think you taught him
how to kill, too.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.663
You know, Jonah wanted revenge
for his grandmother's death,

41:38.705 --> 41:41.583
and you showed him the way,
didn't you?

41:44.836 --> 41:46.755
This is Gretel Fischer's
employment file.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.798
And don't bother saying
that they're not yours

41:48.840 --> 41:50.234
'cause our lab's already
comparing the prints.

41:50.258 --> 41:51.635
This...?

41:51.676 --> 41:53.428
Well, this sure as shit
ain't conjecture.

41:53.470 --> 41:55.030
So let's stop fucking
with the undercard

41:55.055 --> 41:56.556
and get to the main event.

41:56.598 --> 41:58.225
For the sake of your career,

41:58.266 --> 42:01.311
I suggest you set me free now.

42:01.353 --> 42:03.813
Well, for the sake of your
old ass not dying in jail,

42:03.855 --> 42:05.899
I suggest you start talking.

42:10.362 --> 42:12.072
Dottie?

42:14.532 --> 42:18.119
You will not believe
the day I had.

42:18.161 --> 42:21.748
Why is it that every time
a woman takes a man's job,

42:21.790 --> 42:24.417
she has to rub our noses in it?

42:31.549 --> 42:33.176
Dottie.

42:33.218 --> 42:36.263
Oh, no.

42:38.139 --> 42:39.766
D...

43:06.293 --> 43:07.627
Fuck your face.

43:07.669 --> 43:10.046
Fuck your face.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.924
Fuck. Fuck.

43:12.966 --> 43:16.344
Fuck your face! Fuck!

43:32.694 --> 43:35.655
These documents are yours.

43:35.697 --> 43:37.657
Now I have them.

43:37.699 --> 43:40.618
So who sent them to me, Meyer?
Who wanted to see you go down?

43:40.660 --> 43:42.829
Let's pretend for a moment

43:42.871 --> 43:45.665
that all this nonsense
you're talking about is true.

43:45.707 --> 43:47.667
Sure.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.462
If I was really doing
what you're suggesting...

43:50.503 --> 43:52.005
You are.

43:53.256 --> 43:56.885
Who do you think my enemies are?

43:58.970 --> 44:01.348
Exactly.

44:01.389 --> 44:06.186
And if, hypothetically,
those were my enemies,

44:06.227 --> 44:08.355
wouldn't they want you
to have these documents?

44:08.396 --> 44:10.857
So you could hold me here,

44:10.899 --> 44:13.401
like you're doing right now,

44:13.443 --> 44:16.529
while Nazis run amok.

44:17.655 --> 44:20.742
When you interviewed the boy
at my home,

44:20.784 --> 44:24.996
you told him he could still
choose to do the right thing.

44:25.038 --> 44:26.164
I did.

44:26.206 --> 44:28.541
And what about you?

44:28.583 --> 44:31.211
Do you think you're choosing
the right thing now?

44:31.252 --> 44:35.673
I do. It looks that way.
I'm not the one in handcuffs.

44:41.429 --> 44:44.307
Look, all I'm saying is
it's the FBI.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.850
Maybe we should be worried.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.578
Meyer has been
in more difficult situations.

44:47.602 --> 44:49.562
I'm talking about the feds here.

44:49.604 --> 44:53.233
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Uch, you have a funny way
of showing gratitude.

44:53.274 --> 44:55.735
You hear me?
You hear me, you little mamzer?

44:55.777 --> 44:58.571
Meyer took you in
when you were in need.

44:58.613 --> 45:00.907
All right, better late
than never, huh?

45:00.949 --> 45:02.009
You know,
and please don't tell me

45:02.033 --> 45:03.386
that you didn't know
about him and my safta.

45:03.410 --> 45:05.203
Because you tried to tell me
that one day

45:05.245 --> 45:06.663
when I came to your place.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.499
That he bailed on the woman
that he loved.

45:09.541 --> 45:12.377
Left her alone to raise
their kid.

45:12.419 --> 45:13.979
And when that kid died,
giving birth to me,

45:14.003 --> 45:15.338
he stayed gone.

45:15.380 --> 45:19.217
That whole fucking time,
my safta and I, we struggled,

45:19.259 --> 45:21.928
he stayed gone.
So, sorry if I'm not

45:21.970 --> 45:25.014
doing cartwheels
over finally meeting Grandpa.

45:25.056 --> 45:28.017
'Cause fuck him.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.687
Ever stop to think that
maybe that's what she wanted?

45:30.728 --> 45:32.981
For Meyer to stay gone?

45:33.022 --> 45:34.190
All I'm saying is,

45:34.232 --> 45:35.859
you may think
you've got Meyer figured,

45:35.900 --> 45:37.694
soup to nuts, but...

45:37.735 --> 45:40.363
you can never really
know a person.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.449
We wear different faces
to protect each other.

45:47.704 --> 45:49.205
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

45:51.624 --> 45:53.334
It's him.
It's the, it's the guy

45:53.376 --> 45:54.603
who killed Booty.
He's heading towards the train.

45:54.627 --> 45:57.380
- Lonny, do you see him?
- Where?

45:57.422 --> 45:58.582
I, I don't, I don't have him.

46:00.800 --> 46:01.885
- The subway, dammit!
- Hey!

46:01.926 --> 46:04.262
Wait!

46:04.304 --> 46:05.555
Fuck a duck!

46:18.610 --> 46:21.696
- These are the coordinates.
- A utility plant?

46:23.281 --> 46:27.076
What the hell do you do
with a virus at a power plant?

46:27.118 --> 46:28.786
Let's split up and find out.

46:50.517 --> 46:53.019

You didn't bring me here

48:12.181 --> 48:14.392

- Why else would I
have brought you here?

48:14.434 --> 48:17.562

49:17.205 --> 49:18.790
