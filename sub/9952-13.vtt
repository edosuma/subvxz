14:16.690 --> 14:18.430
Big personality. Owns the place.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.103
Okay. Okay. Kung fu Christmas.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.024
Come here. Look, listen to me.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.693
You need to calm down, all right?

14:23.780 --> 14:25.566
Nobody knows what you're talking about.

14:25.657 --> 14:29.491
Listen, this is the first place that I realized
that there was something different.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.534
But there was a report
that came in from earlier.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.286
Yes. Come on.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.291
I'm sorry, she's just not
in the Christmas spirit.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.081
Duke!

14:44.801 --> 14:47.008
So, what, they only found half her body?

14:47.512 --> 14:49.298
What does that
have to do with disappearing?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.004
Could only half of her have disappeared?

14:51.099 --> 14:53.476
I don't know.
I've seen a lot of big fish out there.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.383
No, she wasn't bitten.

14:55.479 --> 14:58.437
And this is too clean of a cut
to have been a propeller.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.603
Where's the ambulance?

15:00.275 --> 15:01.481
Where are the other cops?

15:02.360 --> 15:05.193
Well, maybe they're busy
with other cases around town.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.693
The guy said they tried to call 911 again,
but it didn't work.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.192
-What?
-No one answered.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.659
You're gonna leave me here
with the half dead body?

15:17.542 --> 15:18.793
(MOBILE RINGING)

15:19.461 --> 15:20.496
Hey, where are you?

15:20.587 --> 15:21.997
I'm down at Chester's cove.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.000
You know that 911 isn't answering?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.752
Town really is falling apart.

15:25.842 --> 15:29.175
Well, I got a crime scene over here.
Can you just send somebody over?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.837
Funny. Send someone. Who?

15:32.349 --> 15:33.634
I'm sorry, what?

15:33.725 --> 15:34.840
NATHAN: Who else would / send?

15:35.060 --> 15:36.846
You and l are the only cops in Haven.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.516
Parker? Parker?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.360
(SILENT NIGHT PLAYING ON PHONE)

15:51.076 --> 15:52.191
Oh, no.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.369
You know Nathan Wuornos, right?

15:57.707 --> 15:58.742
No.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.997
I mean, does anybody really know that guy?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.329
Oh. Oh, thank God.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.334
I thought you were saying
that he disappeared, too.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.256
That would make for a good Christmas.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.217
Remind me,

16:17.561 --> 16:18.767
what was under here?

16:21.273 --> 16:22.558
What?

16:33.076 --> 16:36.694
All right, weird Haven Christmas events,
anything come to mind?

16:36.788 --> 16:37.868
Not really.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.447
There was the gingerbread man incident.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.786
You can imagine the cover-up! (LAUGHS)

16:44.588 --> 16:46.670
A cover-up we couldn't do

16:46.965 --> 16:48.501
if we sold the Haven Hera/d.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.045
-We're discussing that now.
-Yes, we're having that discussion.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.843
Okay, what about anything
where people are disappearing?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.603
Here's something.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.262
November 5, 1955.

17:03.356 --> 17:08.191
A man claims to have made all of his
neighbors and most of his family disappear.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.940
But they never existed.
But he insisted they did.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.942
So, everyone thought he was crazy.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.613
Sound familiar?

17:15.118 --> 17:17.905
Here's one other thing,
happened around the same time.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.361
Something else did turn up.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.781
A full-sized train on its own track

17:22.876 --> 17:26.460
surrounding a weird green field
with a bunch of horses.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.958
No explanation where they came from.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.002
Okay, well, what can you tell me about him?

17:31.134 --> 17:34.297
lnsane Arthur Chambers,
about 50, family man.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.343
-Wait. Chambers.
-Yeah.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.843
I met a guy named Chambers this morning.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.137
He came to pick up his missing daughter.

17:41.811 --> 17:45.269
If they're related,
then he could've made his wife disappear.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.222
Maybe he's the one who's causing all this.

17:47.317 --> 17:50.809
And what happened to the OG Chambers?

17:51.363 --> 17:53.979
Tried to "bring everyone back", he said.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.486
But it didn't work. Killed himself soon after.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.736
Lovely.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.781
No one he described ever reappeared.

18:00.872 --> 18:04.035
If they ever lived, they were gone forever.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.327
Okay. Well, whatever this trouble is,
if we don't stop it,

18:08.463 --> 18:10.795
everybody in the town of Haven
could disappear.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.168
Well, that'll make deliveries
an awful lot easier.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.670
And a lot cheaper.

18:14.844 --> 18:20.009
Everyone in Haven gets a paper delivered
to their door, all 3,101 of them.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.973
Wait. What? How many?

18:22.060 --> 18:24.927
3,101 citizens in Haven.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.977
Check the masthead in today's edition.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.728
Guys,

18:31.653 --> 18:35.191
lastlchecked,
Haven had over 20,000 people in it.

18:48.878 --> 18:49.958
Glad you're here.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.295
Not easy keeping up with everything today.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.338
I'm looking for the address for a suspect.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.216
Aha! Damn it, you're still here.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.210
It was my one Christmas wish,
and it didn't come true.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.135
He's on board
with the whole disappearing thing now?

19:02.225 --> 19:03.886
Maybe you guys should be partners.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.557
Hey, hey.
You didn't hear Vince and Dave's story.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.727
Who's your suspect?

19:08.857 --> 19:11.189
Gordon Chambers. He was in earlier today.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.819
Looks like he moved to Derry.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.240
Maybe he left town because he knew
what he was gonna do to Haven.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.075
Hey, come with us.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.652
Somebody's got to stay here.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.905
We are the only police.

19:27.042 --> 19:30.751
If you are the only police, Nathan,
then why are there all these desks?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.543
Why are there all these offices?

19:33.506 --> 19:37.920
Why are you the only classmates
in the class photo?

19:40.263 --> 19:41.423
This is...

19:43.058 --> 19:44.594
It's where the photographer put us.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.433
-Remember?
-Nathan, I'm your partner, right?

19:47.562 --> 19:49.518
-Yes.
-You trust your partner?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.520
Yes.

19:52.609 --> 19:53.689
Thank you.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.522
This is a nice moment.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.697
But we should probably go.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.241
Hmm? Okay, I'll go wait in the car.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.113
Listen, I know that this doesn't
make any sense, okay?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.035
But I need you to come with me.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.708
Make it, you know,
my Christmas present or something.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.457
I hope you're happy,

20:14.798 --> 20:16.629
'cause I'm starting to hate Christmas, too.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.805
NATHAN: Hell of a way to
start Christmas morning.

a wrecker on the radio out here?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.595

20:33.316 --> 20:35.307
I'll try and move these cars.

when l was a kid?

20:51.292 --> 20:54.500

you're gonna tell me anyway.

A Chrome Lightning race sled.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.253
-Polished bottom.
-The beveled rails.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.927
-Yeah.
-I wanted the same thing for Christmas.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.017
Wait. You two wanted the same thing?

21:11.438 --> 21:12.803
That's weird.

21:14.691 --> 21:18.354
Okay, I hate to cancel Christmas morning,

21:18.445 --> 21:23.155
but the population was
almost twice this just a few hours ago.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.689
Really?

21:30.540 --> 21:34.328

21:41.384 --> 21:43.625
-smashed into thin air?
-Yeah.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.130
That's weird, right?

21:47.182 --> 21:50.549
It must be hard to be the only person
who knows when things get

21:50.894 --> 21:53.180
-funky around here.
-Yeah.

21:54.063 --> 21:57.146
Trust me, being right all the time,
it's not always the greatest thing.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.064
Yeah, I know.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.650
You know, it's tough
for people like you and me.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.399
Maybe I could help you with that.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.572
-You could help me?
-You talking to yourself?

22:06.743 --> 22:07.823
Huh?

22:09.162 --> 22:10.197
Wait.

He's got a mustache, a goatee.

the people that disappeared,

22:35.271 --> 22:36.602
they never came back.

Stand back.

23:50.722 --> 23:53.464
Well, you think we can go around?

23:53.558 --> 23:56.265
No. See how it curves?

23:56.352 --> 23:58.343
I bet you it circles the whole town.

23:58.688 --> 24:02.522
This thing coming down, that would explain
that woman being cut in half.

24:02.984 --> 24:04.690
And she was near the town border, too.

24:05.862 --> 24:08.854
So, why hasn't anybody
on the outside run into it yet?

24:08.990 --> 24:10.526
Are they forgetting all of us, too?

24:11.034 --> 24:13.616
Pretty soon there's not gonna be
any of us left to forget.

24:13.703 --> 24:16.570
That number's gone down 500
since we've been standing here.

24:17.874 --> 24:20.581
We need to get to Derry, find Chambers now.

24:20.710 --> 24:24.043
Yeah, but if we're trapped in Haven,
maybe he is, too.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.293
According to that file,
he still owns a store in town.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.290
-What kind of store?
-Toys.

Dave showed me. Look at this.

Arthur Chambers brought
a train like this to life

to a whole new level.

With Christmas toys?

25:19.977 --> 25:22.889
Something with a giant glass dome.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.106
Like this.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.031
Maybe.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.865
Maybe Gordon Chambers
is bringing snow globes to life.

29:31.312 --> 29:34.645
When I saw you at the precinct,
you made me realize that.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.484
That I never had a wife.

29:38.361 --> 29:41.103
But that's impossible,
because I have a daughter.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.437
She has to have a mom.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.906
So, you know about Arthur Chambers?

29:46.786 --> 29:49.823
Grandpa, who loved building
his model trains.

29:50.039 --> 29:51.279
I guess a little too much.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.952
He said that we were all troubled,

29:54.460 --> 29:57.873
and that one day, we'd make our loved ones
vanish forever, too.

29:57.964 --> 30:00.250
And nobody would ever know
that they ever existed.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.005
I never thought that was true.

30:03.511 --> 30:04.967
And then today, it happened.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.216
And I don't know if I can undo it.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.049
Okay. Where were you?
Where were you when this all started?

30:11.644 --> 30:14.010
l was on my way to see my daughter.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.888
I moved out of here last night.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.436
But I love my Radley.

30:19.527 --> 30:22.234
I mean, she's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.854
But I moved out. Why would I do that?

30:25.324 --> 30:26.700
Why would I leave her alone?

30:27.827 --> 30:29.533
Do you know if I had a wife?

30:30.121 --> 30:31.236
You don't know?

30:32.331 --> 30:36.074
Your grandfather, he remembered
the people that disappeared, but you don't.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.167
So, you can't be doing this.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.132
And your daughter,
she remembers her mother...

30:44.301 --> 30:45.381
It's not you.

30:47.763 --> 30:48.923
It's your daughter.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.350
-She's still alive.
-Oh, my God.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.554
-I thought she disappeared.
-Okay, she's still here.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.149
Does she have her own snow globe?

30:59.233 --> 31:01.098
Yeah, I made it for her last Christmas.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.526
Okay, no, listen,
I need you to tell me where she is, all right?

31:04.613 --> 31:08.401
If we don't find her,
these people could be gone forever.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.530

Hi, again, Hadley.

32:48.551 --> 32:49.961
What are you doing here?

32:51.554 --> 32:52.714
Matinee.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.676
Is that the snow globe your dad made you?

32:59.562 --> 33:02.804
-You know you're a special kid, right?
-Yeah.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.056
That's what they say when they leave.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.478
You know that you're turning
the whole town into that snow globe?

33:11.866 --> 33:12.901
You're crazy.

33:13.909 --> 33:15.740
That's your fantasy world, right?

33:15.870 --> 33:17.826
-You love it?
-Leave me alone.

33:18.706 --> 33:22.745
Hadley, where do you think everybody went?
Where are all the people?

33:23.502 --> 33:24.708
I don't know.

33:25.421 --> 33:26.706
People always leave.

33:27.256 --> 33:28.917
My dad walked out on us.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.085
-Your dad loves you.
-He doesn't.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.919
No one does.
Even my mom left me alone here.

33:34.221 --> 33:38.180
And the reason everybody's gone
is because people are always leaving me.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.428
It's not the snow globe.

(SILENT NIGHT PLAYING)

33:52.615 --> 33:55.106
-What's happening?
-Haven is turning into your snow globe.

34:03.626 --> 34:04.615
Give it to me.

34:08.214 --> 34:10.125
-Come on!
-Why isn't it stopping?

34:10.257 --> 34:12.714
Because handing it to me isn't enough.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.884
You're living inside of there,
and you need to stop.

34:15.971 --> 34:19.213
No. I like it in there.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.594
You like it? All alone?

34:23.062 --> 34:24.097
Yeah.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.683
You're lying. You're running away.

34:30.277 --> 34:33.235
You don't know anything about me.

34:33.447 --> 34:36.109
Yes, I do, because we're the same.

34:37.493 --> 34:41.156
You want to be alone,
because you think that you have to be.

34:41.247 --> 34:43.863
But you don't. We don't.

34:46.126 --> 34:51.621
-I do. My dad left us and now...
-Things are different.

34:51.715 --> 34:54.582
I know what it's like
for things to be different.

34:55.135 --> 34:58.423
But just because they are,
that doesn't mean that the people in your life

34:58.514 --> 35:00.004
stop caring about you.

He said that you were the best thing
that ever happened to him.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.191

when all of this started.

35:15.072 --> 35:16.152
He was?

35:17.658 --> 35:20.491
Yeah. He called you "Radley".

35:21.453 --> 35:22.704
They might not be together,

35:22.788 --> 35:25.621
but your folks will be there
when you need them, trust me.

I know that the real world isn't always
everything that you thought it would be.

35:30.713 --> 35:34.205
But sometimes, it can surprise us
in good ways.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.387
I don't remember anything, but

37:10.270 --> 37:12.306
I think I may have caused an accident.

37:13.315 --> 37:15.146
Or not. I don't know.

37:16.443 --> 37:17.979
You didn't cause an accident.

37:21.115 --> 37:22.605
In fact, you helped me clean one up.

37:23.075 --> 37:25.191
I did? Good.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.697
I mean, that's great. Audrey?

37:28.580 --> 37:31.697
Maybe when you get here, you can explain
to me why I'm in a Santa costume.

37:31.792 --> 37:34.534
I'm having one of those Haven moments.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.289
Okay.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.351
I'm here.

can explain why I woke up

38:03.031 --> 38:04.646
in a toy store this morning.

38:05.075 --> 38:07.191
| just decided to throw a little party.

-In July.
-Yeah.

a new Haven tradition.

in my bar. What the hell is going on?

What? Okay, that's weird.

38:41.945 --> 38:45.312
Very. I thought we were her only friends.

a Christmas party in July?

-Audrey.
-Hey, guys.

38:51.413 --> 38:56.203
So, normally, it's after the party
that the memory gets a little foggy.

38:56.293 --> 38:59.205
Nobody here can remember
what happened today.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.418
Only in Haven.

39:01.048 --> 39:04.461
Audrey, maybe you could
tell us what happened today.

39:05.302 --> 39:06.462
I could,

39:07.513 --> 39:10.755
but I think you would do a betterjob of it
in the Herald.

39:10.891 --> 39:13.052

39:13.143 --> 39:15.429
No. Don't get rid of the paper.

Believe me when I say
it's the only reason that Haven's still here.

39:19.233 --> 39:20.769
That's why we're celebrating.

39:21.068 --> 39:22.103
Well,

39:22.402 --> 39:24.984
I guess we could call it a gas leak.

-We can do better than that.
-What?
