00:01.369 --> 00:03.437
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.471 --> 00:05.406
They believed the Money Pit
was over here.

00:05.439 --> 00:08.176
What we haven't got is what
direction they were drilling.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.244
-We have to do more research.
-This is quite a document.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.645
-Have you seen that before?
-No, I haven't.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.613
ALEX:
It showed unmistakable evidence

00:12.646 --> 00:15.149
of having gone into gold.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.651
He's in some sort of void,
but he hit something.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.253
RICK: Hopefully,
it's what we're looking for.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.754
-TERRY: Okay,
that's interesting. -RICK: Wow.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.690
DAVE: How are we
getting pottery at 190 feet?

00:22.723 --> 00:24.425
RICK:
We have one more piece.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.394
What is that?

00:26.427 --> 00:28.329
My immediate reaction
is it's bone.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.735
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.768 --> 00:38.139
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.172 --> 00:41.175
for more than 200 years.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.812
So far, they have found
bits of gold chain,

00:44.845 --> 00:48.849
a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...

00:48.882 --> 00:52.353
even a 17th century
Spanish coin.

00:52.386 --> 00:55.123
To date, six men have died

00:55.156 --> 00:57.691
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.294
And, according to legend,

01:00.328 --> 01:02.863
one more will have to die

01:02.896 --> 01:06.167
before the treasure
can be found.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.379
*

01:26.454 --> 01:30.324
NARRATOR: As a new day begins
on Oak Island,

01:30.358 --> 01:34.162
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with their team,

01:34.195 --> 01:36.530
remain singularly focused
on their efforts

01:36.564 --> 01:39.633
to locate
the original Money Pit.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.802
Getting lots of wood again.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.272
-Just what we need.
-More wood.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.606
More wood.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.743
They have
recently completed 16

01:49.777 --> 01:53.347
of approximately 40
six-inch-wide boreholes,

01:53.381 --> 01:57.251
using what is known
as the Geotech system.

01:57.285 --> 02:00.588
This involves drilling
each hole down to bedrock,

02:00.621 --> 02:04.358
and then, after lining it
with plastic PVC pipe,

02:04.392 --> 02:06.727
scanning the hole
with a metal detector

02:06.760 --> 02:10.598
to locate artifacts
or possible treasure.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.434
If one or more
of the exploratory shafts

02:13.467 --> 02:15.503
offers positive results,

02:15.536 --> 02:19.307
they can be marked as sites
for future excavation.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.710
-Hey, John.
-Good morning, Marty.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.412
How are you?
Good to see you.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.247
-Terry.
-Hey, John. How are you?

02:26.280 --> 02:30.518
Today, the team is joined
by geophysical engineer

02:30.551 --> 02:33.354
and Oak Island researcher
John Wonnacott,

02:33.387 --> 02:36.557
who, along with his partner,
Les MacPhie,

02:36.590 --> 02:40.228
helped to develop
the Geotech grid map.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.463
John Wonnacott is
an engineer's engineer.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.865
He's a mining engineer,
and he and Les MacPhie

02:44.898 --> 02:47.868
actually give me a lot of hope
about the Money Pit,

02:47.901 --> 02:50.438
because those two guys,
they look at that data

02:50.471 --> 02:53.641
and they conclude, with
a high degree of certainty,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.344
that it's a man-made structure.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.978
Well, where the hell is it!?!

02:58.011 --> 02:59.380
(chuckling)

02:59.413 --> 03:00.681
Where is it, John?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.716
How come we got
12 holes drilled here

03:02.750 --> 03:04.485
and we haven't found
anything yet?

03:04.518 --> 03:05.786
Actually, how many? 16, right?

03:05.819 --> 03:07.888
Yeah, that's right,
pushing that.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.590
Nothing in the places
you looked, I guess.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.791
(laughter)

03:10.824 --> 03:12.860
Thank you. Thank you.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.696
NARRATOR: To create
their Geotech drilling grid,

03:15.729 --> 03:19.500
Wonnacott and MacPhie relied
on information compiled

03:19.533 --> 03:21.569
over the past 200 years

03:21.602 --> 03:24.605
by generations
of treasure hunters.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.341
But what has made their task
much more difficult

03:27.375 --> 03:29.410
is that the Money Pit area

03:29.443 --> 03:31.745
is literally cluttered
with drill pipes,

03:31.779 --> 03:35.649
giant boulders, and a number
of abandoned searcher shafts,

03:35.683 --> 03:39.553
including those built
by M.R. Chappell in 1931

03:39.587 --> 03:44.024
and Gilbert Hedden in 1937.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.027
There are very few knowns
in the Money Pit area.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.862
We have lots of documentation,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.798
we have lots
of archival records,

03:50.831 --> 03:53.501
and we know them
to be inconsistent,

03:53.534 --> 03:55.936
if not misleading.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.272
I still believe
we'll be successful,

03:58.306 --> 04:00.808
I still believe there's
something there to be found,

04:00.841 --> 04:04.512
and that we will engage in a
large-scale engineering project

04:04.545 --> 04:08.015
to recover whatever it is at
great depth in the Money Pit.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.517
So...

04:09.550 --> 04:12.553
I'm... not giving up.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.522
MARTY:
Where's the treasure?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.424
John, where's the treasure?
Put your finger on it, please.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.791
-Well, actually...
-Yeah?

04:17.825 --> 04:19.827
I think the Money Pit

04:19.860 --> 04:22.062
is still where we've got
this dotted line on the drawing.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.565
-Really?
-And William Chappell

04:24.598 --> 04:26.834
gave us his notes
of his drilling,

04:26.867 --> 04:29.069
and I'm relying
on this dotted outline

04:29.102 --> 04:31.339
for the drilling platform.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.574
What we haven't got
is any actual description

04:33.607 --> 04:35.743
of where they set up the drill

04:35.776 --> 04:37.745
and what direction
they were drilling.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.980
The only logical thing
to conclude

04:40.013 --> 04:42.350
is that they believed
the Money Pit

04:42.383 --> 04:43.851
was over here at some depth.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.819
I really want to see
what we're gonna get

04:45.853 --> 04:47.488
in this band of holes down here.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.323
What's the point of all those?

04:49.357 --> 04:50.758
'Cause we're thinking
of scratching these.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.460
I'll just be candid with you.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.528
Well, the point was,
it completed the grid.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.664
This is where we thought
the Money Pit would be.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.832
If we're wrong, it could be
this way or this way.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.468
But we're adding
a bunch of holes,

05:00.501 --> 05:02.470
and if we can subtract
a couple...

05:02.503 --> 05:04.838
-There's not an infinite supply
of money, is there? -Of course.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.675
And I think it's correct
to not drill these yet.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.411
I think the pattern that
we're on drilling down here,

05:10.444 --> 05:12.646
-I think we get a...
-Finish up this way?

05:12.680 --> 05:15.449
-Finish up this way. Yep.
-Yes.

05:15.483 --> 05:19.853
To me, this was
the high-value target area here.

05:19.887 --> 05:23.123
I always assumed that we
would come back to these areas.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.559
-WONNACOTT: Yeah.
-I've always believed,

05:25.593 --> 05:27.695
since we were knee-high
to a grasshopper.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.930
-I believe it's here.
-I know you do.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.133
-It's here.
-Right.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.135
I worry about my brother.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.037
Right now, he's carrying
the whole weight of this.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.773
He is. And I don't know
how he's going to react

05:39.807 --> 05:42.410
if we dig all these wells
and we don't find anything.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.378
I mean,
he's passionate about it,

05:44.412 --> 05:47.581
but he's got
a certain reverence about it

05:47.615 --> 05:50.784
that could lead to,
you know, some really hard...

05:50.818 --> 05:52.119
hard feelings.

05:52.152 --> 05:55.389
Not between us, but on himself.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.825
All right.
Let's keep drilling.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.762
-You won't get an argument
from me. -Okay.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.898
NARRATOR: As Rick, Marty and
the team from Brewster Drilling

06:04.932 --> 06:08.502
continue their efforts
at the Money Pit site...

06:08.536 --> 06:10.971
an additional search
is taking place

06:11.004 --> 06:14.808
at the Beaton Institute,
located in the town of Sydney,

06:14.842 --> 06:19.480
some 300 miles northeast
of Oak Island.

06:19.513 --> 06:23.050
Here, Alex Lagina,
Charles Barkhouse,

06:23.083 --> 06:25.919
and Rick and Marty's nephew,
Peter Fornetti,

06:25.953 --> 06:28.956
have arranged to meet
area historian Doug Crowell,

06:28.989 --> 06:31.158
who has spent
the last several days

06:31.191 --> 06:33.494
searching a number
of important documents

06:33.527 --> 06:35.696
that were donated
to the institute

06:35.729 --> 06:39.467
by legendary Oak Island
treasure hunter M.R. Chappell.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.537
Documents which the team hopes
will offer fresh information

06:43.571 --> 06:45.839
concerning the precise location

06:45.873 --> 06:49.209
of the original
Oak Island Money Pit.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.479
CHARLES: Here's
something interesting, Doug.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.047
This is an affidavit
by William Chappell

06:54.081 --> 06:56.550
in connection
with the drilling done in 1897.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.219
Now, that's, of course, where
they hit the suspected vault,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.855
where they found
the piece of parchment.

07:01.889 --> 07:05.659
NARRATOR: While drilling
in the Money Pit in 1897,

07:05.693 --> 07:08.696
treasure hunters William
Chappell and Frederick Blair

07:08.729 --> 07:12.533
encountered what they believed
was a mysterious wooden vault,

07:12.566 --> 07:17.037
located at a depth of 153 feet.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.607
Even more astonishing
was the discovery

07:19.640 --> 07:22.476
of a tiny piece of paper
on which were written

07:22.510 --> 07:24.878
the letters "V-I."

07:24.912 --> 07:27.815
But before Chappell and Blair
could dig deep enough

07:27.848 --> 07:30.150
to retrieve
the mysterious vault,

07:30.183 --> 07:33.086
the hole they were digging
caved in due to flooding,

07:33.120 --> 07:37.057
and the vault's
exact location was lost.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.861
For two years, they
attempted to find it again.

07:40.894 --> 07:44.231
But, plagued by constant
flooding and scarce funding,

07:44.264 --> 07:48.736
they gave up their search
in 1899.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.238
Since then,
dozens of treasure hunters

07:51.271 --> 07:54.808
have come to the island
in hopes of finding the vault,

07:54.842 --> 07:57.911
including Chappell's own son,
Melbourne,

07:57.945 --> 08:00.981
also known as M.R.

08:01.014 --> 08:05.719
In 1931, he began constructing
a shaft of his own,

08:05.753 --> 08:08.288
off which he built
a horizontal tunnel

08:08.321 --> 08:12.893
in the last-known direction of
the so-called "Chappell Vault."

08:12.926 --> 08:15.195
But, just like
his father's expedition

08:15.228 --> 08:18.999
three decades before,
the Chappell Shaft was plagued

08:19.032 --> 08:21.835
by flooding
and numerous cave-ins.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.006
This is quite a document,
this-this thing right here.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.876
It's a compilation of a number
of things: affidavits

08:28.909 --> 08:32.145
and descriptions of
the whole Oak Island discovery

08:32.179 --> 08:34.915
-up to that point. So...
-Have you seen that before?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.784
No I haven't, no. So...

08:36.817 --> 08:38.285
-Nice find.
-Absolutely.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.554
That's the type
of information we want,

08:40.588 --> 08:43.123
something closer to the source
and the time period.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.158
ALEX:
Have you heard this?

08:45.192 --> 08:48.328
This is a sworn statement
by Frederick Blair.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.931
"Mr. Putnam was
too conservative and cautious

08:50.964 --> 08:53.166
"to state publically
the important fact

08:53.200 --> 08:55.268
"that when the drill came
to the surface,

08:55.302 --> 08:57.070
"it showed unmistakable evidence

08:57.104 --> 08:59.673
"of having gone through
or into gold.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.711
"He did, however,
make such a statement

09:03.744 --> 09:06.079
in confidence to me
and to a few close friends."

09:06.113 --> 09:09.116
I have heard rumors that
there was indications of gold,

09:09.149 --> 09:10.918
but I never knew the source.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.653
ALEX:
This is a sworn statement

09:12.686 --> 09:14.855
that they drilled through gold.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.696
NARRATOR: While searching
through a rare collection

09:22.730 --> 09:24.765
of documents once belonging

09:24.798 --> 09:27.067
to Oak Island
treasure hunter M.R. Chappell,

09:27.100 --> 09:29.369
Alex Lagina, Charles Barkhouse,

09:29.402 --> 09:31.338
Peter Fornetti

09:31.371 --> 09:33.841
and area historian Doug Crowell

09:33.874 --> 09:36.777
have just made a potentially
significant discovery.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.746
Well, I think
this is interesting enough

09:38.779 --> 09:40.648
that we should call my dad.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.884
They have found a sworn
affidavit attesting to the fact

09:43.917 --> 09:46.353
that traces of gold
were on the drill bit

09:46.386 --> 09:49.857
used by treasure hunter William
Chappell after he penetrated

09:49.890 --> 09:54.161
a mysterious seven-foot-tall
wooden vault in 1897.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.098
(autodials)

09:58.131 --> 09:59.767
(phone rings)

10:02.035 --> 10:03.704
Hello?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.272
-Hey.
-Hey, Alex.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.240
We're here
at the Beaton Institute.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.877
We've been going through
some of Chappell's old files.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.651
...1897 shaft that was drilled.

10:17.685 --> 10:21.722
Um, this is Blair
making a sworn statement.

10:21.755 --> 10:25.392
"I was well acquainted
with T. Pearly Putnam,

10:25.425 --> 10:27.127
"who acted as manager
of the work done

10:27.160 --> 10:28.662
"at the island for...

10:33.400 --> 10:35.268
"He was a man
in whose honesty and integrity

10:35.302 --> 10:37.805
"I would place
the greatest reliance.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.007
"I heard him repeatedly tell
his experience

10:40.040 --> 10:41.975
"with the auger and drill
in the drill hole

10:42.009 --> 10:44.778
in which wood was first struck
at 154 feet."

10:45.946 --> 10:47.715
Yeah. Keep going, now.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.882
All right? I want to hear this.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.718
This is the interesting one.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.787
"Mr. Putnam was too conservative
and cautious

10:53.821 --> 10:55.923
"to state publically
the important fact

10:55.956 --> 10:57.891
"that when the drill
came to the surface,

10:57.925 --> 10:59.993
"it showed unmistakable evidence

11:00.027 --> 11:02.195
of having gone through
or into gold."

11:02.229 --> 11:04.231
-Wow.
-Wow.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.967
'Cause Frederick Blair was
supposed to be really honest,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.468
honest guy, right?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.037
Yeah, and this is a sworn...

11:10.070 --> 11:11.739
I mean, this is under oath,
basically.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.909
You're right.
It would be probably criminal

11:15.943 --> 11:17.277
to lie about this.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.380
Wow, that is pretty impressive.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.316
It was all apocryphal,
you know, in sense of,

11:23.350 --> 11:25.886
"Oh, this guy supposedly
said that, and it's in a book."

11:25.919 --> 11:29.456
I never heard
of a sworn statement before.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.459
NARRATOR: Although the story
of gold being found

11:32.492 --> 11:35.829
on William Chappell's drill bit
is not a new one,

11:35.863 --> 11:37.865
finding evidence
of a sworn affidavit

11:37.898 --> 11:39.499
by Frederick Blair

11:39.532 --> 11:42.469
suggests that this is one
Oak Island legend

11:42.502 --> 11:45.138
that is likely based on fact.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.474
A fact that suggests

11:47.507 --> 11:50.243
that the stories
of an incredible treasure

11:50.277 --> 11:52.780
being buried somewhere
deep within the Money Pit

11:52.813 --> 11:54.782
could also be true.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.050
It just makes you believe
it's really there.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.286
But why can't we find it?

12:00.988 --> 12:03.490
I mean, that vault
has been an enigma

12:03.523 --> 12:05.725
since the first time
we read about it.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.462
All right, well, good job.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.864
Keep digging.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.835
(laughter)

12:14.868 --> 12:16.336
-Will do.
-All right, cheers.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.071
Touché.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.340
Thanks. Bye.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.016
NARRATOR: After a productive day
of searching

12:29.049 --> 12:31.384
through M.R. Chappell's
personal papers...

12:31.418 --> 12:33.053
All right, gentlemen,

12:33.086 --> 12:34.788
this is-this is what caused me

12:34.822 --> 12:36.123
to lose a little bit
of sleep here.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.858
NARRATOR:
Alex Lagina,

12:37.891 --> 12:40.493
along with Charles Barkhouse,
Peter Fornetti

12:40.527 --> 12:43.030
and area historian
Doug Crowell,

12:43.063 --> 12:46.033
return
to the Oak Island War Room.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.368
In addition
to their earlier discovery

12:48.401 --> 12:50.137
of Frederick Blair's
sworn affidavit,

12:50.170 --> 12:52.840
they believe
they have found new information

12:52.873 --> 12:56.409
concerning
the Oak Island Money Pit.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.247
I think this may be affecting
the Geotech grid,

13:00.280 --> 13:03.183
and we may be missing
an important spot.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.520
So, one of the things
that caught my attention,

13:07.554 --> 13:08.956
of course,
from reading the dig notes

13:08.989 --> 13:10.958
for the Chappell shaft...

13:10.991 --> 13:12.392
When they were digging
the Chappell Shaft,

13:12.425 --> 13:13.927
which was basically
trying to hit

13:13.961 --> 13:15.495
the Money Pit site at the time,

13:15.528 --> 13:17.164
the bottom of the shaft

13:17.197 --> 13:20.934
was ten to 12 feet north

13:20.968 --> 13:22.502
of where the top
of the shaft was.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.840
I didn't realize
it was that far out.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.108
Exactly.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.210
If this information is correct,

13:30.243 --> 13:31.879
they missed this area,

13:31.912 --> 13:34.247
and they probably missed
the Money Pit?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.216
Yes.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.854
NARRATOR: The news that the
bottom of the Chappell Shaft

13:40.888 --> 13:43.957
lies some ten to 12 feet north
of its entrance

13:43.991 --> 13:46.626
is hugely significant.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.030
Until now,
Rick, Marty and the team

13:50.063 --> 13:53.333
had assumed that the shaft
had been completely vertical

13:53.366 --> 13:55.502
and had used that assumption

13:55.535 --> 13:58.538
in the planning
of their Geotech grid.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.373
But the new information

14:00.407 --> 14:02.876
discovered in the papers
at the Beaton Institute

14:02.910 --> 14:04.444
will allow the team

14:04.477 --> 14:06.079
to choose
their next drilling targets

14:06.113 --> 14:07.948
more accurately.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.917
What he's saying is this
has not been investigated.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.351
-Yes.
-Yeah, exactly.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.353
At the depths
at which the Chappell Vault...

14:13.386 --> 14:15.288
was encountered...

14:15.322 --> 14:17.024
-They would have missed it.
-They would have missed it.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.226
-Okay.
-RICK: The fact that

14:19.259 --> 14:21.895
now we know the direction
in which it had deviated,

14:21.929 --> 14:25.598
it exposes new ground
for this Geotech grid program.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.534
We have may have to adjust
some of the holes.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.369
Right now we're only putting
three in there.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.071
I think we should look
to putting four

14:31.104 --> 14:33.040
-in each of these sections.
-We may.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.242
I think their discoveries

14:35.275 --> 14:37.978
of where the Chappell shaft
deviated to

14:38.011 --> 14:39.913
were basically
all I could hope for.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.950
I didn't expect there
to be an "X" marks the spot.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.284
I'd say it's about as successful

14:44.317 --> 14:46.053
-as it could be.
-Right.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.489
So, excellent new information,
guys. Well done.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.192
-Yeah. -And now
let's get back in the field.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.927
-Agreed?
-Agreed.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.236
One day after learning
critical new information

15:03.270 --> 15:06.506
on the actual location
of the Chappell Shaft,

15:06.539 --> 15:09.442
Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island Team

15:09.476 --> 15:12.245
head to the Money Pit
search area.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.148
They are hoping that the new
drill sites they have chosen

15:15.182 --> 15:17.317
will produce better results

15:17.350 --> 15:20.353
than those
they have experienced so far.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.089
-Hey, Rick. Good morning.
-Good morning, Terry.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.524
-How are you? Good to see you.
-How are you? Good.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.394
I think the consensus
is we'll just push on

15:27.427 --> 15:29.429
-down the rock.
-That's the idea, yeah.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.498
NARRATOR:
The Oak Island team

15:31.531 --> 15:34.501
has now modified
their Geotech drilling pattern

15:34.534 --> 15:36.703
by adding
eight new target holes

15:36.736 --> 15:40.273
in an approximately
ten by 20 foot triangle area

15:40.307 --> 15:43.510
not covered
in their previous grid.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.079
They are hoping
the first of these holes--

15:46.113 --> 15:48.481
Borehole H-8-- will allow them

15:48.515 --> 15:51.084
to finally find
the elusive Chappell Vault,

15:51.118 --> 15:52.652
originally discovered

15:52.685 --> 15:54.221
by treasure hunter
William Chappell

15:54.254 --> 15:57.157
in 1897.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.092
Let's get her going
and see what's down there.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.428
-Hopefully it's what
we're looking for. -Let's roll.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.670
IVAN:
Keep going.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.207
TERRY: Ivan's got the touch,
doesn't he?

16:14.241 --> 16:16.643
CHARLES: I think I know
what you're thinking.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.011
What am I thinking?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.279
You're thinking that, uh,

16:19.312 --> 16:20.647
this hole's gonna be it.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.682
The excitement ratchets up a bit

16:22.715 --> 16:25.552
because we've now got data

16:25.585 --> 16:27.354
which says
that we've got fresh ground,

16:27.387 --> 16:29.222
that we've got
an area of interest

16:29.256 --> 16:32.192
based upon archival records,

16:32.225 --> 16:33.593
that today might be the day

16:33.626 --> 16:35.128
where we actually find

16:35.162 --> 16:37.030
the one irrefutable piece
of evidence.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.731
It should be a good day.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.467
NARRATOR:
As drilling gets underway

16:40.500 --> 16:42.602
in Borehole H-8...

16:44.771 --> 16:46.406
MARTY:
Let's go down to the beach.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.276
NARRATOR:
Marty Lagina, Dave Blankenship

16:49.309 --> 16:51.778
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

16:51.811 --> 16:54.814
head to the area known as
the Boulderless Beach

16:54.847 --> 16:58.451
located on the island's
northern shore.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.588
Here, they hope to discover
more important artifacts--

17:01.621 --> 17:03.523
and possible treasure--

17:03.556 --> 17:05.258
that may have been exposed

17:05.292 --> 17:07.660
by last winter's
powerful storms.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.396
I like this area.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.830
MARTY: You see here,
Gary, how it really is...

17:10.863 --> 17:12.332
is rocks?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.234
Yeah, it seems to finish.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.104
NARRATOR: When veteran
treasure hunter Dan Blankenship

17:17.137 --> 17:20.607
first came to Oak Island
in 1965,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.510
the causeway linking the island
to the mainland

17:23.543 --> 17:25.745
had yet to be built.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.747
Arriving by boat,

17:27.780 --> 17:30.183
he noticed
an unusual stretch of beach

17:30.217 --> 17:32.485
which lacked
the large rocks and boulders

17:32.519 --> 17:34.254
that are characteristic

17:34.287 --> 17:36.623
of the rest
of the island's coastline.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.726
Dan speculated
that the approximately

17:39.759 --> 17:41.661
one hundred-foot-long
stretch of land

17:41.694 --> 17:44.731
was man-made
and may be further evidence

17:44.764 --> 17:46.833
of unusual activity
on the island

17:46.866 --> 17:51.771
prior to the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.441
It doesn't look natural at all.
It really doesn't.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.609
And we've actually
subsequently determined

17:56.643 --> 17:58.345
that it extends out
into the water,

17:58.378 --> 18:00.113
that there are rocks
in the water

18:00.147 --> 18:01.614
to the right and to the left
of this spot,

18:01.648 --> 18:03.283
but not here.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.385
So, you know,
that implies strongly

18:05.418 --> 18:06.886
it should be a good place
to hunt.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.323
You can definitely see
a defined area

18:10.357 --> 18:12.459
where the boulders
start and stop.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.893
This is my go-to

18:13.926 --> 18:17.230
"Spanish treasure hunting" rig.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.833
NARRATOR: Instead of his usual
metal detecting search coil,

18:20.867 --> 18:24.437
Gary will be using
the GPX 5000,

18:24.471 --> 18:26.806
a high-performance
pulse induction rig

18:26.839 --> 18:30.377
which specializes
in finding deep artifacts.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.811
With strength equivalent

18:31.844 --> 18:34.514
to eight metal detectors
in one,

18:34.547 --> 18:38.285
its increased sensitivity
makes it an ideal choice,

18:38.318 --> 18:40.720
especially
when searching in areas

18:40.753 --> 18:43.423
that have been heavily scanned
in the past.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.459
GARY: I can't believe the lack
of freakin' metal on this lot.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.361
MARTY:
It's been metal-detected before,

18:48.395 --> 18:50.797
but I was expecting that thing
to find some.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.266
Well, whenever I get discouraged
is when he finds something,

18:53.300 --> 18:54.901
so I'm gonna sit on this rock
and be discouraged.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.736
-(metal detector beeping)
-Signal, guys.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.605
-(Marty laughs)
-Just as you sit down.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.507
What did I tell...
what did I tell you?

19:00.540 --> 19:03.476
Oh, man. Great.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.812
More than likely
a piece of iron.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.780
-Yep.
-(metal detector beeping)

19:07.814 --> 19:09.949
That's a strong hit.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.151
That's definitely something.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.732
Oh, I can see it.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.635
Can you see
all that iron residue?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.903
-No.
-Now you will.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.839
-Where? Right there?
-Yeah.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.343
-(metal detector beeping)
-Ooh. -There you go.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.379
Right in the center of the hole.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.880
-Come on, coin! Coin!
-Okay.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.915
-It's rocky in here.
-DAVE: Gold!

19:42.949 --> 19:44.517
-Do you want me to shovel
a bit more? -Oh!

19:44.551 --> 19:45.885
-There it is. Look.
-Where?

19:45.918 --> 19:47.220
-Ooh, look.
-There you go.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.521
-Look at that.
-There you go.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.224
-What do you got?
-I see what that is.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.230
That is an old
wrought iron spike.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.443
NARRATOR: At the area known
as the Boulderless Beach...

20:10.477 --> 20:11.978
-That's a big one, Dave.
-Yep.

20:12.011 --> 20:15.282
NARRATOR: ...Marty Lagina,
Dave Blankenship

20:15.315 --> 20:17.650
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

20:17.684 --> 20:19.252
have just unearthed

20:19.286 --> 20:21.954
a potentially significant
artifact.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.891
And that is commonly referred to
as a ship spike.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.727
I would say that is early 1700s.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.431
NARRATOR:
A spike from a ship?

20:31.464 --> 20:34.567
Dating back
to the early 18th century?

20:34.601 --> 20:37.937
Ooh. Now that's a good signal.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.772
NARRATOR:
Could this spike be related

20:39.806 --> 20:42.275
to the others the team
has found on the island...

20:42.309 --> 20:44.511
-Oh, yeah.
-Ooh, look at that. That's nice.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.913
NARRATOR:
...both in the swamp

20:46.946 --> 20:48.848
and the GAL-1 spoils?

20:48.881 --> 20:51.751
Ooh.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.354
Yeah, but it'd have to be
the size of the Titanic

20:54.387 --> 20:55.788
to use a nail that big.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.790
Well,
that's just the point, David.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.659
-That's kind of exciting,
actually, isn't it? -(laughs)

20:59.692 --> 21:01.894
It wasn't
any itty-bitty boat here.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.896
But that's definitely old.
I mean, that's an oldie.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.465
-Oh, that'd be good.
-Yeah.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.933
You know, it occurs to me,

21:06.966 --> 21:08.435
we do have an archeologist

21:08.468 --> 21:09.602
running around here, don't we?

21:09.636 --> 21:10.903
(laughter)

21:10.937 --> 21:12.305
Let's let him have a look.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.740
NARRATOR:
Because Marty believes

21:13.773 --> 21:15.375
the metal spike may have

21:15.408 --> 21:17.076
historical significance,

21:17.109 --> 21:19.912
he has decided to reach out
to area archaeologist

21:19.946 --> 21:24.317
Laird Niven, who has recently
joined the Oak Island team.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.518
Hello?

21:25.552 --> 21:27.420
Yeah. Laird.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.956
Hey, do you have a minute
to come down to the beach?

21:29.989 --> 21:32.759
We've got an artifact
we'd like you to have a look at.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.895
Good deal. See you in a bit.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.797
Thanks. Bye.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.099
This is not gonna be easy.
We have to follow the clues.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.901
And these spikes are clues.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.036
You know, when were they made?
What were they used for?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.005
How do they interrelate
with each other?

21:46.038 --> 21:47.474
And we're keeping
all this data,

21:47.507 --> 21:48.908
and we're gonna go over it.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.743
Gary thinks that
the story's gonna be told

21:50.777 --> 21:52.845
with things like that.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.014
That that's how we're gonna
uncover the whole mystery here.

21:57.517 --> 22:01.454
NARRATOR: While Marty and the
team wait for Laird to arrive,

22:01.488 --> 22:04.591
Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team

22:04.624 --> 22:07.860
are eagerly searching
the spoils of Borehole H-8

22:07.894 --> 22:10.397
that have been
brought up so far.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.599
Yeah.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.539
MIKE G.:
That's very interesting.

22:19.572 --> 22:23.075
NARRATOR: First discovered
in the early 19th century,

22:23.109 --> 22:26.379
the application
of coal tar-based creosote

22:26.413 --> 22:29.582
became a common treatment
to prevent wooden structures

22:29.616 --> 22:33.486
from rotting
when heavily exposed to water.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.923
The fact the wood brought up
from H-8 smells of creosote

22:36.956 --> 22:39.459
most likely indicates evidence

22:39.492 --> 22:41.694
of a 19th century
searcher tunnel,

22:41.728 --> 22:45.498
and not that
of a more ancient structure.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.634
RICK:
Yeah, I don't smell it anymore.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.769
Where are we now?

22:49.802 --> 22:53.005
We are at 135.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.041
RICK:
We're right around target depth.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.045
NARRATOR:
Although the Chappell Vault

22:59.078 --> 23:01.013
was originally encountered

23:01.047 --> 23:05.585
at a depth of 153 feet in 1897,

23:05.618 --> 23:08.154
decades of subsequent
searcher activity

23:08.187 --> 23:10.457
and underground flooding

23:10.490 --> 23:12.725
has significantly reduced
the elevation

23:12.759 --> 23:17.029
of the Money Pit search area
by an estimated ten feet.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.099
This means that
the vault could now lie

23:20.132 --> 23:22.101
anywhere from 140

23:22.134 --> 23:25.972
to as much
as 160 feet deep underground.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.416
(loud thump, metallic squeak)

23:55.535 --> 23:58.938
Ivan said he's in some sort
of void, but he hit something.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.974
RICK:
Did he clip something?

24:02.008 --> 24:03.543
MIKE G.:
Yeah, he was going down,

24:03.576 --> 24:05.044
and then he clipped something.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.079
RICK: Where would that
have been, at one...?

24:07.113 --> 24:08.848
That's at, uh...

24:08.881 --> 24:12.719
140, 145.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.887
NARRATOR:
A mysterious void?

24:14.921 --> 24:17.524
One containing a large object

24:17.557 --> 24:21.193
some 145 feet deep
belowground?

24:21.227 --> 24:24.531
Has the drill bit
just made contact

24:24.564 --> 24:26.866
with the elusive
Chappell Vault?

24:26.899 --> 24:28.568
And could the answers

24:28.601 --> 24:31.704
to the 222-year-old
Oak Island mystery

24:31.738 --> 24:35.074
finally be within reach?

24:35.107 --> 24:37.910
-RICK: That's right where
it should be. -Yeah.

24:37.944 --> 24:41.113
RICK: It mimics exactly
the drill platform experience

24:41.147 --> 24:43.650
that the Chappells, when
they encountered the vault.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.652
It's the right depth.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.755
Ivan's a great driller,
and I have always believed

24:48.788 --> 24:50.957
that when you have
eyes and boots on the ground,

24:50.990 --> 24:52.992
those guys,
that's who you go to.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.595
And so you've got testament

24:55.628 --> 24:57.564
that you're
alongside a hard object,

24:57.597 --> 24:59.866
it's the proper depth,
proper location--

24:59.899 --> 25:02.702
it doesn't get
much better than that.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.604
I know you
can't look underground,

25:04.637 --> 25:06.939
but what do you think
you slid by?

25:06.973 --> 25:10.643
You push by something, you
never know what it was, right?

25:10.677 --> 25:13.813
Well, let's go to 170
and see if you get a sense

25:13.846 --> 25:17.216
that you slide by
or pass something.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.722
NARRATOR: In order to find
more definitive proof

25:22.755 --> 25:25.191
that the Chappell Vault
has been located,

25:25.224 --> 25:28.661
Rick Lagina instructs the team
to continue drilling.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.997
RICK: Ivan said
he went down into a void,

25:31.030 --> 25:33.299
but he clipped something.

25:33.332 --> 25:36.168
Something that
he doesn't recognize.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.970
Okay.

25:38.004 --> 25:40.907
RICK: The sense is that
right around 171,

25:40.940 --> 25:44.210
if he senses
that he passed something,

25:44.243 --> 25:46.746
then maybe we pull
the casing back up,

25:46.779 --> 25:48.881
put the plastic down.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.019
Yeah.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.060
NARRATOR: As the team
from Brewster Drilling

26:01.093 --> 26:04.230
continues their search for
evidence of the Chappell Vault,

26:04.263 --> 26:07.233
archeologist Laird Niven
has finally arrived

26:07.266 --> 26:09.836
at the Boulderless Beach.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.337
Here's Laird.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.906
-You found us.
-Hi, guys. I did.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.107
How you doing, mate?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.809
So, what say you?

26:16.843 --> 26:18.077
It's a spike?

26:18.110 --> 26:19.879
-A spike.
-Yup, yup.

26:19.912 --> 26:23.616
-We've come to that conclusion.
-(laughter)

26:23.650 --> 26:24.851
NARRATOR:
Laird Niven's participation

26:24.884 --> 26:26.786
in the Oak Island treasure hunt

26:26.819 --> 26:28.755
has helped assure
Canadian authorities

26:28.788 --> 26:30.890
that all island artifacts--

26:30.923 --> 26:33.292
as well as
culturally protected sites--

26:33.325 --> 26:35.294
will be properly handled.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.630
-That's nice. That's...
-That really is.

26:37.664 --> 26:40.366
He is also
an invaluable resource

26:40.399 --> 26:42.769
to Rick, Marty and the team
in their efforts

26:42.802 --> 26:45.371
to identify and date
objects that may be

26:45.404 --> 26:48.007
not only
historically important,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.209
but instrumental
in helping them solve

26:50.242 --> 26:53.112
-the Oak Island mystery.
-It's a nice one.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.246
Hand-wrought, obviously.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.248
Nice rose head.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.951
-You do consider that
a rose head on that? -Oh, yeah.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.352
And now
the million-dollar question:

27:00.386 --> 27:02.955
-How old would you say that is?
-(sighs)

27:05.758 --> 27:07.860
-We keep asking you this.
-I know, I know.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.663
Well, it's definitely
within the 18th century.

27:10.697 --> 27:14.734
-That's what I figured. 1700s.
-Yeah. Yeah.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.103
I was telling the guys,
this is, like, a clue.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.271
You know, either a dock
or a wharf here,

27:19.305 --> 27:20.973
or even a shipwreck.

27:21.007 --> 27:24.276
A wharf would make sense to me.
Yeah.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.212
NARRATOR:
A wharf?

27:26.245 --> 27:28.815
If so, who built it,

27:28.848 --> 27:30.950
and what was their purpose?

27:30.983 --> 27:33.152
Could it have been a place

27:33.185 --> 27:36.188
for a pirate
to offload his treasure?

27:36.222 --> 27:40.693
Perhaps 18th century privateer-
turned-Oak Island landowner,

27:40.727 --> 27:41.961
Captain James Anderson...

27:41.994 --> 27:43.896
Check this thing out.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.198
NARRATOR: ...whose sea chest
was examined by members

27:46.232 --> 27:48.768
of the Oak Island team
just a few weeks ago.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.704
-Think this is it.
-Ah. Ah...

27:53.139 --> 27:56.442
-1700-ish?
-Yep. Yeah.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.746
-Significant. -Yeah, definitely
from the 1700s, it is.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.013
-MARTY: Well...
-(laughs)

28:01.047 --> 28:02.114
...that's good.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.291
NARRATOR:
At the Oak Island Money Pit,

28:12.324 --> 28:15.862
Rick Lagina, Dave Blankenship,

28:15.895 --> 28:20.032
Charles Barkhouse
and geologist Terry Matheson

28:20.066 --> 28:23.502
continue to monitor the
progress of Borehole H-8,

28:23.535 --> 28:26.505
where just hours ago
the drillers encountered

28:26.538 --> 28:31.310
a mysterious object
at a depth of 145 feet.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.045
How deep are we now?

28:33.079 --> 28:35.181
-195.
-All right.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.889
No bedrock yet,

28:42.922 --> 28:44.390
so we might as well
drive it to bedrock.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.325
He'll put this ten feet on,

28:46.358 --> 28:48.995
and they we're gonna be done.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.130
I had high hopes
for this one, too.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.399
Right on the drill platform.

28:53.432 --> 28:57.103
It was crazy geologically,
kind of weird.

28:57.136 --> 29:01.740
But, if this hits rock
and we don't find anything...

29:03.910 --> 29:08.147
NARRATOR: Now, nearly
200 feet deep underground,

29:08.180 --> 29:10.482
40 feet past
their target depth,

29:10.516 --> 29:13.820
the team has yet to find
further evidence

29:13.853 --> 29:17.123
that they may have discovered
the legendary Chappell Vault.

29:17.156 --> 29:21.227
I mean, H-8 was set on
the drill platform of 1897,

29:21.260 --> 29:24.163
where they believed they
encountered the so-called Vault.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.399
It's inside
of the Chappell Shaft.

29:27.433 --> 29:31.370
William, M.R.'s father,
designated the location

29:31.403 --> 29:32.972
of this drill platform,

29:33.005 --> 29:35.407
and they thought
they were spot-on.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.910
And, you know, were they?

29:37.944 --> 29:39.812
Is it there, or is it not?

29:43.850 --> 29:46.352
TERRY: Okay,
that's kind of interesting.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.925
RICK:
Wow.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.395
Wow, really!

29:59.298 --> 30:01.033
-RICK: Glazed pottery
or something. -DAVE: Pottery?

30:01.067 --> 30:02.534
TERRY:
Blue pottery.

30:02.568 --> 30:05.237
How are we getting pottery
at 190 feet?

30:05.271 --> 30:06.605
That's confounding.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.841
NARRATOR:
Pottery?

30:08.875 --> 30:12.311
Found at a depth
of approximately 190 feet?

30:12.344 --> 30:15.447
Although finding bits
of pottery on Oak Island

30:15.481 --> 30:17.483
is not a rare occurrence,

30:17.516 --> 30:19.551
the depth at which this
fragment was recovered

30:19.585 --> 30:22.121
is deeper than any
found before,

30:22.154 --> 30:26.058
and deeper that any previously
known searcher activities.

30:26.092 --> 30:29.395
Could this, perhaps,
be further evidence

30:29.428 --> 30:32.364
that the team really has
located the mysterious

30:32.398 --> 30:34.200
Chappell Vault?

30:34.233 --> 30:36.302
Well, I did not have
a tea party down there.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.436
That is a...
Yeah, that's...

30:37.469 --> 30:38.871
Well, let's show these guys.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.973
We are going to
drive it to rock.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.878
RICK:
Hey!

30:45.912 --> 30:48.580
What's that?

30:48.614 --> 30:50.016
IVAN: That blue, that looks like
pottery or something.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.283
RICK:
It is pottery.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.552
-RICK: Look at that.
-IVAN: What!?

30:53.585 --> 30:57.323
Oh, my God.
Pottery, wow.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.659
DAVE:
You broke up the teapot!

31:00.692 --> 31:02.361
He told me to drill there.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.896
(laughter)

31:05.164 --> 31:07.366
Look, another piece.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.968
IVAN:
That's crazy.

31:09.001 --> 31:11.403
TERRY: A couple pieces,
that's pretty...

31:11.437 --> 31:13.372
RICK:
We'll call it right here.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.141
We're gonna push to bedrock
and see what...

31:15.174 --> 31:16.675
see if there's more of it.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.211
-Yeah. -So, we'll see you guys
in the morning.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.948
-Yes!
-Thank you.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.685
NARRATOR: As the team
from Brewster Drilling

31:26.718 --> 31:30.089
finishes operations
for the day, it is decided

31:30.122 --> 31:33.192
that they will continue
drilling in Borehole H-8

31:33.225 --> 31:35.194
until bedrock is reached.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.897
Oh, what's that jumping up
at us?

31:44.070 --> 31:46.072
CHARLES:
What do you make of that?

31:47.506 --> 31:49.475
On first inspection,

31:49.508 --> 31:51.643
to me, it looks like wood.

31:51.677 --> 31:54.646
But it's extremely dense.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.016
What was the depth
at which this was found?

31:57.049 --> 31:59.385
That was between 160 and 165.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.121
It's dense and hard.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.256
It doesn't look like rock.
It's not rock.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.628
Well, you got a geologist saying
it's not a stone.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.363
TERRY: It's very, uh--
it's not a stone.

32:11.397 --> 32:12.498
CHARLIE: I mean,
there's a few possibilities

32:12.531 --> 32:15.167
-of what it could be.
-Like what?

32:15.201 --> 32:17.169
Could it be lignum vitae?

32:17.203 --> 32:20.472
-Super dense wood.
-CHARLES: Super dense wood.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.075
NARRATOR:
Latin for "wood of life,"

32:23.109 --> 32:26.212
lignum vitae is a dense,
tropical wood

32:26.245 --> 32:27.679
native to the Caribbean

32:27.713 --> 32:30.616
and northern coast
of South America.

32:30.649 --> 32:34.620
One of many species commonly
referred to as "ironwoods,"

32:34.653 --> 32:37.756
its durability and resistance
to the elements

32:37.789 --> 32:40.759
made it an ideal choice for
nearly all moving parts

32:40.792 --> 32:42.995
of seafaring vessels,

32:43.029 --> 32:45.064
from 16th century ships

32:45.097 --> 32:47.599
to the first nuclear-powered
submarine,

32:47.633 --> 32:51.537
the 1952 USS Nautilus.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.173
RICK:
I only can tell you one thing.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.208
-What? -I'm surely
gonna get it tested.

32:56.242 --> 32:59.078
Absolutely. That's got to be on
the top ten list

32:59.111 --> 33:00.779
-of curious things we've pulled
out of there. -No, I'd...

33:00.812 --> 33:03.382
-I'd say it's top five.
-Yeah.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.384
-RICK: It's a remarkable find.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.785
RICK:
Let's find out what it is.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.021
Get to the bottom of it.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.789
-Anyway, I'm gonna bag it.
-Bag it.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.659
Bag it and tag it.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.199
(line ringing)

33:26.305 --> 33:29.141
-MARTY: Hello.
-Hey. Me.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.610
You know we're in,
we're in, uh, H-8.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.579
Couple of interesting objects.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.615
One is, we found a...

33:36.648 --> 33:40.419
a piece of something
at 160 to 165.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.155
We literally are--
don't know what it is.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.724
It's-it's extremely dense.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.427
Uh, very heavy.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.463
Uh, Charles gave an opinion
that maybe it's, uh,

33:51.497 --> 33:54.333
some exotic subtropical species

33:54.366 --> 33:56.802
called lignum vitae,
if it's wood.

33:56.835 --> 33:59.838
Um, you know...

33:59.871 --> 34:04.643
Is there something we can do
to-to take a look at that?

34:09.848 --> 34:11.383
Here's the thing that's
really quite,

34:11.417 --> 34:13.785
uh, perplexing, and that is

34:13.819 --> 34:18.357
that we found pottery at 192.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.661
No one has been down that deep.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.764
192. 192.

34:25.797 --> 34:29.768
Came up in the samples
from 190 to 195,

34:29.801 --> 34:33.172
but, but, uh, we're--

34:33.205 --> 34:35.807
I guess we're guesstimating
around 192,

34:35.841 --> 34:38.110
but certainly 190 and beyond.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.817
Absolutely.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.542
Okay. (chuckles)

35:10.576 --> 35:12.911
Sets me on my task,
I'll get it tested.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.480
Or looked at, for sure.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.449
Yeah. O-Okay. Take care.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.684
Yep. Bye.

35:28.327 --> 35:32.164
NARRATOR: After a day of
breakthroughs on Oak Island...

35:32.198 --> 35:34.533
So, Laird, we're very grateful
that you're coming back to us.

35:34.566 --> 35:37.303
Your oversight as archaeologist
is important to us.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.371
NARRATOR:
Rick, Marty, and members

35:39.405 --> 35:41.540
of the team gather
in the War Room,

35:41.573 --> 35:43.442
where they are eager to discuss

35:43.475 --> 35:45.211
a few of their recent findings

35:45.244 --> 35:48.314
with area archaeologist
Laird Niven.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.881
We have a collection here

35:49.915 --> 35:52.918
of-of some artifacts
that we've recovered.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.953
-Right. -We're hopeful
that you can help us, uh,

35:54.986 --> 35:57.723
at least give us some insight,
in two ways:

35:57.756 --> 36:00.659
one, perhaps telling us
what the items are.

36:00.692 --> 36:04.230
Maybe a timeline,
maybe a-a composition.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.198
-Okay.
-So, uh,

36:06.232 --> 36:07.966
why don't we get Craig
on the line?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.336
Hey, Craig.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.870
-Craig, can you hear us all
just fine? -Sure can.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.839
Hey, guys.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.408
NARRATOR: Also joining them
via video conference

36:16.442 --> 36:18.744
from his office
in Traverse City, Michigan,

36:18.777 --> 36:23.315
is Rick and Marty's friend and
business partner, Craig Tester.

36:23.349 --> 36:27.419
So, we've got a little, I call
it our little box of goodies,

36:27.453 --> 36:30.256
and Laird's here, and he's going
to give us his opinion

36:30.289 --> 36:33.359
as to the-- perhaps...
-How old they are.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.860
Perhaps time-lining them.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.762
Okay, sounds good.

36:36.795 --> 36:40.232
This came from
the Money Pit area.

36:40.266 --> 36:41.800
Well, here-here, uh, Laird,

36:41.833 --> 36:43.702
-I'll let you take them out.
-Yeah.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.577
LAIRD:
So this is pearlware.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.846
That's between 190
and 195 feet down.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.549
Yeah. So this would be...

36:57.583 --> 37:02.288
This is hand painted pearlware
from England, Staffordshire.

37:02.321 --> 37:07.726
We're looking at
the 1780s to 1800.

37:07.759 --> 37:11.663
It's imitating, uh, Chinese
porcelain, is what it's doing.

37:11.697 --> 37:14.400
How did pottery get down
to 192 feet?

37:14.433 --> 37:17.369
That I do not know.

37:17.403 --> 37:20.272
What did Terry think of it
when he looked at it?

37:20.306 --> 37:23.542
You know, Terry Matheson's
a geologist, and he's,

37:23.575 --> 37:26.378
he's struggling with motive and
placement for-for that,

37:26.412 --> 37:28.647
because it's-- well, I mean,
it's below searcher depth.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.549
MARTY:
Nobody's been down that deep.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.351
No searchers have been
down that deep.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.853
NARRATOR: Although
it is Laird's estimation

37:34.886 --> 37:37.789
that the pottery may only
pre-date the discovery

37:37.823 --> 37:40.058
of the Money Pit
by just a few years,

37:40.091 --> 37:42.761
the great depth at which
it was recovered

37:42.794 --> 37:45.697
still offers the team
an important clue--

37:45.731 --> 37:48.467
one that may justify
a further investigation

37:48.500 --> 37:50.936
into Borehole H-8.

37:50.969 --> 37:55.341
I think the pottery found in
H-8, below searcher depth,

37:55.374 --> 37:57.976
is the most significant thing
we've discovered this year.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.646
-I find that... -And that's
a "wow" fact for me.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.549
-Yeah. For me.
-For him, for him to say that.

38:03.582 --> 38:07.786
Look, data's data, you know, and
when the data says what it says,

38:07.819 --> 38:11.890
no human beings, historically,
were down that deep. Period.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.493
And then we have one more piece.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.795
Uh, I'm not gonna tell you
anything about it,

38:16.828 --> 38:20.532
because we'd like you
to give us your opinion.

38:20.566 --> 38:22.334
What is that?

38:27.506 --> 38:29.708
My immediate reaction is
it's bone.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.877
MARTY:
Holy smokes.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.483
It is bone.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.884
JACK:
Wait, what?

38:40.652 --> 38:42.688
RICK:
You're certain that's bone?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.623
I'm fairly certain.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.092
Where was that found?

38:47.125 --> 38:52.464
H-8 at 160 to 165.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.600
NARRATOR:
Bone?

38:54.633 --> 38:58.036
Found buried 160 feet deep
in the Money Pit?

38:58.069 --> 39:01.407
But if the mysterious object
is, in fact, bone,

39:01.440 --> 39:03.442
how did it get there?

39:03.475 --> 39:05.577
And, perhaps more importantly,

39:05.611 --> 39:09.548
to what, or to whom,
did it belong?

39:09.581 --> 39:11.750
Of everything I thought
you were gonna say,

39:11.783 --> 39:13.385
-it would not have been bone.
-"Bone" wasn't it?

39:13.419 --> 39:14.786
-Yeah.
-No, absolutely not.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.788
Yeah, well...

39:21.092 --> 39:23.595
You're certain that's not wood?

39:23.629 --> 39:25.431
I don't think so.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.499
See, it's hollow.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.501
It's dense, I know, but...

39:29.535 --> 39:32.070
MARTY:
What is it? Human or animal?

39:32.103 --> 39:33.872
I can identify human bones,

39:33.905 --> 39:35.841
but it's more difficult
with the fragment.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.543
Then, I understand.
Like any good scientist,

39:37.576 --> 39:39.044
you don't want to make
a conclusion

39:39.077 --> 39:40.846
till all the data's in.
I get it, completely.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.114
You seriously think that's bone?

39:43.148 --> 39:45.951
-I do.
-(chuckles)

39:45.984 --> 39:47.719
Wow.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.121
Wish I could say
I wasn't surprised,

39:50.155 --> 39:51.990
but I am very surprised.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.025
I never would have
suspected bone.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.061
You didn't expect
any of this, did you?

39:56.094 --> 39:58.730
(laughter)

39:58.764 --> 40:00.632
MARTY:
I think it's bone.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.568
I don't think I would have
independently thought

40:02.601 --> 40:04.035
it was bone, but if the choices
are bone or wood,

40:04.069 --> 40:05.937
I think it's a piece of bone.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.138
It does not look like
wood to me.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.774
Look, if it, if it was human,

40:08.807 --> 40:10.976
and it's pre-1780,

40:11.009 --> 40:14.746
you've got your
original works again.

40:14.780 --> 40:19.618
So we're gonna follow
where the bone leads.

40:19.651 --> 40:22.053
I think we can get it tested
in some way, shape, or form.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.689
Can we carbon date that?

40:23.722 --> 40:25.624
What do you s--
what say you, Craig?

40:25.657 --> 40:28.494
Well, I was wondering about
getting a chemical analysis

40:28.527 --> 40:31.129
or something of it, to see
impurities or whatnot.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.732
Maybe that will help date it,
too.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.867
Imagine that.
We don't have an answer

40:35.901 --> 40:37.135
from an artifact
in the Money Pit.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.638
(laughter)

40:39.671 --> 40:42.040
CHARLES: Gee, that's never
happened before.

40:42.073 --> 40:44.209
Okay, I think, I think
we have a plan.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.512
-You know, we'll get to the
bottom of it. -Absolutely.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.547
-Thank you Laird, appreciate it.
-LAIRD: Thank you.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.016
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty,
and the Oak Island team,

40:51.049 --> 40:53.819
this week's search for answers

40:53.852 --> 40:57.255
has offered a number of
promising new leads.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.759
But just where, or to what,
are they being led?

41:00.792 --> 41:03.529
Is it to an ancient
wooden vault

41:03.562 --> 41:06.598
filled with priceless artifacts
and treasure?

41:06.632 --> 41:09.668
Or could it be to something
far more mysterious,

41:09.701 --> 41:11.970
and perhaps more dangerous,

41:12.003 --> 41:14.806
than anything they could have
ever imagined?

41:14.840 --> 41:18.677
Perhaps the answer
can be found embedded

41:18.710 --> 41:20.912
in a simple piece of bone...

41:20.946 --> 41:24.149
a bone that may have belonged
to the last person

41:24.182 --> 41:27.919
to know the truth about
what really lies below.

41:29.755 --> 41:32.558
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:32.591 --> 41:34.225
Ooh!

41:34.259 --> 41:37.162
It's bone, with some soft tissue
on it, and hairs.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.230
Is it human?

41:39.264 --> 41:40.832
-You getting readings?
-Yeah.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.133
We need to see what's there.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.702
Picking something else up
right here.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.604
What do you make of that?

41:45.637 --> 41:48.707
In H-8, there is definitely
an anomaly.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.542
I think we found the Money Pit.

41:50.576 --> 41:52.243
-(both laughing)
-Yes!

41:52.277 --> 41:54.212
We now have results
from the two bones--

41:54.245 --> 41:56.815
both came back as human.
