15:46.570 --> 15:48.572

16:19.228 --> 16:20.479

17:18.494 --> 17:22.124
- Thank you.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.459

<i>If you look at the molars</i>

<i>if you follow</i>
<i>where the top teeth go,</i>

17:26.962 --> 17:27.713
<i>that would just be</i>
<i>an impossibility.</i>

17:27.796 --> 17:30.257

- Good thing you picked it.

38:41.318 --> 38:42.278
- Let's move on to Stacy.

38:42.361 --> 38:44.989
- You do have some solid,
clean lines,

38:45.072 --> 38:46.741
<i>and you do have some</i>
<i>areas of color that blend</i>

38:46.824 --> 38:48.576
<i>from one color to</i>
<i>the next color</i>

38:48.659 --> 38:50.286
solidly and smoothly.

38:50.369 --> 38:51.579
- But the shape of the koi
is completely off.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.290

<i>huge and fat up top</i>

38:54.373 --> 38:57.293

<i>back fin area.</i>

38:57.376 --> 38:58.627

38:58.711 --> 39:00.421
I know I threw literally
everything I had at it.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.466
{\an1}- I am furious that
Matt walked out the door

39:03.549 --> 39:05.718
and you're gonna sit here
and defend that [bleep].

39:05.801 --> 39:07.094
- I did my best.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.431
- You're mean, mean old man.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.476
{\an8}<i>- Line work versus line work,</i>
<i>color versus color--</i>

39:13.559 --> 39:15.019
{\an8}<i>my vote's for Stacy.</i>

39:15.102 --> 39:16.270
{\an3}- Stacy.

39:16.353 --> 39:17.730
- The winner of the face-off
is Stacy.

39:17.813 --> 39:22.109
De'Vonne, please pack
your machines and head out.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.944

Thank you.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.575
{\an8}and it just sucks
to be going home so early.

39:29.658 --> 39:30.951
<i>I feel like I let them down.</i>

39:31.035 --> 39:33.204
- Congratulations, Stacy.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.997
That means that
you are now on team Cleen.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.457
{\an1}- [whispers]
Good job.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.626

I'm gonna throw up.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.377
- That's it.
The teams are full.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.463
Everyone get settled
into the loft,

39:42.546 --> 39:44.173
and let the grudge match begin.
