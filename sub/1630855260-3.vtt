WEBVTT

00:01.926 --> 00:04.668
(gentle music)

00:07.577 --> 00:10.050
(somber music)

00:16.268 --> 00:19.580
(somber music continues)

00:24.493 --> 00:24.987
(somber music continues)

00:25.601 --> 00:26.902
- You can't live in
Australia and not hear

00:26.936 --> 00:28.508
about the Hillsong Church.
- Hillsong.

00:28.541 --> 00:29.811
- Hillsong.
- Hillsong.

00:29.844 --> 00:31.283
- Hillsong.
- Hillsong.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.826
(somber music continues)
- In terms of becoming aware

00:34.859 --> 00:38.805
of the failings of the church,

00:41.011 --> 00:44.456
the crimes of some of
its senior members,

00:44.489 --> 00:47.932
well, I think you go back
to this town hall meeting.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.239
(tense music)

00:53.449 --> 00:56.892
This was a time
when institutional
child sexual abuse,

00:56.925 --> 01:00.035
in many ways, was considered
a kind of dark secret,

01:00.068 --> 01:03.077
a place for conspiracies.
(tense music continues)

01:03.110 --> 01:05.150
Victims were
damaged individuals,

01:05.183 --> 01:08.159
and the institutions were the
kind of privileged voices.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.300
(tense music continues)

01:10.333 --> 01:12.473
I spent 11 years in Parliament

01:12.506 --> 01:15.113
fighting for victims
of child sexual abuse

01:15.146 --> 01:17.621
from institutions,
especially the churches.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.000
When you're doing this kind
of work as a politician,

01:22.034 --> 01:24.073
you absolutely
need to find a way

01:24.107 --> 01:26.482
for the story to be told
and fix these broken laws.

01:26.515 --> 01:29.324
(tense music continues)

01:29.357 --> 01:31.630
We booked a big hall
for a Saturday morning.

01:31.663 --> 01:33.067
We put out a few fliers,

01:33.100 --> 01:35.509
and we weren't sure
who would turn up.

01:35.542 --> 01:37.280
And I remember getting there

01:37.314 --> 01:39.654
about 15 minutes before
the meeting started,

01:39.687 --> 01:41.627
and there was a crowd
of people outside

01:41.660 --> 01:43.366
waiting for the doors to open.
(melancholy music)

01:43.399 --> 01:44.702
And I thought to myself, well,

01:44.736 --> 01:48.012
this is going to be
bigger than I suspected.

01:48.045 --> 01:50.487
Within a few minutes,
those seats filled,

01:50.520 --> 01:52.460
and then we put out more
seats and more seats

01:52.493 --> 01:53.429
and more seats.

01:53.463 --> 01:54.732
And then this hall filled

01:54.766 --> 01:57.441
with hundreds,
hundreds of people.

01:57.475 --> 01:59.313
And there were people
standing on the side.

01:59.347 --> 02:02.456
(melancholy music continues)

02:02.490 --> 02:04.093
There was this emotion,

02:04.127 --> 02:05.432
raw emotion in the room.
(melancholy music continues)

02:05.465 --> 02:07.303
- [Victim] He was a monster.

02:07.338 --> 02:09.611
An absolute monster.

02:09.644 --> 02:12.753
- My son committed suicide.
(melancholy music continues)

02:12.786 --> 02:17.668
- Victims and families
were telling their stories.

02:17.701 --> 02:19.339
After we'd heard
from the victims,

02:19.374 --> 02:22.449
we had this police
officer step up.

02:22.483 --> 02:24.086
(melancholy music continues)

02:24.120 --> 02:26.628
- Do we need a royal
commission? By hell we do.

02:26.662 --> 02:30.440
(audience applauding)
(melancholy music continues)

02:30.473 --> 02:33.248
- A royal commission
looks a lot like a court,

02:33.281 --> 02:35.689
but it has powers that
go well beyond the court.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.263
It can force the truth
from institutions.

02:38.296 --> 02:41.239
It can force witnesses
to tell the truth.

02:41.272 --> 02:43.512
This was the first
and best chance

02:43.546 --> 02:46.152
that these victims had had.
(melancholy music continues)

02:46.186 --> 02:49.564
There was this growing
media coverage.

02:49.597 --> 02:53.308
It felt like the
moment had arrived.

02:56.852 --> 03:00.094
(gentle downbeat music)

03:03.572 --> 03:07.718
♪ I hope you find
some peace of mind ♪

03:07.751 --> 03:10.760
♪ In this lifetime ♪

03:21.359 --> 03:25.404

03:40.617 --> 03:44.629
(gentle downbeat

03:47.771 --> 03:48.741
(no audio)

03:48.774 --> 03:51.248
(somber music)

03:56.330 --> 03:58.738
- I think it's incredibly
hard to report on Hillsong

03:58.771 --> 04:00.510
for a number of reasons.
(somber music continues)

04:00.543 --> 04:03.351
The church is not
transparent in any way.

04:04.321 --> 04:06.394
It's run by a board of directors

04:06.427 --> 04:08.768
that was ostensibly
handpicked by Brian Houston.

04:08.801 --> 04:09.971
- Amen! Amen!

04:10.004 --> 04:12.479
- They don't communicate
with the press,

04:12.513 --> 04:14.752
and the church forces
a lot of people

04:14.786 --> 04:16.958
to sign non-disclosure
agreements.

04:16.992 --> 04:18.363
(somber music continues)

04:18.396 --> 04:19.366
You know, if you say bad
things about Hillsong,

04:19.399 --> 04:22.442
Hillsong can then pursue
litigation against you,

04:22.476 --> 04:24.582
so that scares a
lot of people off.

04:24.615 --> 04:27.323
(somber music continues)
(traffic whooshing)

04:27.356 --> 04:30.567
So as a journalist,
sometimes you have to talk

04:30.600 --> 04:33.241
to other journalists who are
working on the same story.

04:35.849 --> 04:39.560
You share information, you
share leads, you share contacts,

04:39.594 --> 04:41.500
and together, you
advance the story.

04:42.468 --> 04:45.778
(somber music continues)

04:47.416 --> 04:48.854
- [Recorder] Mr.
Beckett, thank you.

04:48.888 --> 04:49.790
- [Beckett] Pastor Houston,

04:49.824 --> 04:51.262
I wonder if you could state your

04:51.930 --> 04:53.502
full name, please.

04:54.939 --> 04:56.812
- My full name is
Brian Charles Houston.

04:56.845 --> 04:58.449
- [Beckett] Thank you.

04:58.483 --> 05:01.024
If in our litigation
against any senior pastor,

05:01.057 --> 05:02.729
if that had come forward,

05:02.763 --> 05:04.569
you would want to know
about that, wouldn't you?

05:04.602 --> 05:06.507
- If I had been told
something like that,

05:06.541 --> 05:08.614
I would've been like
a dog with a bone

05:08.647 --> 05:11.723
going after what we're
talking about here.

05:11.756 --> 05:12.793
I was oblivious.

05:12.826 --> 05:13.963
Completely oblivious.

05:13.996 --> 05:16.437
- [Beckett] All right.
(tense music)

05:16.470 --> 05:19.078
I'll just take you through
some of the period before that.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.987
(upbeat rock music)

05:24.194 --> 05:26.635
- We moved here
in 1978, you know,

05:26.668 --> 05:29.376
roughly 12 months
after my parents.

05:29.409 --> 05:32.117
Initially, it was going to be
a one-year working holiday.

05:32.150 --> 05:33.589
(upbeat rock music continues)

05:33.622 --> 05:35.092
- Brian came over
to help his father

05:35.126 --> 05:37.065
when his father moved to
Sydney to start a church.

05:37.098 --> 05:40.041
(upbeat rock music continues)

05:40.074 --> 05:41.780
There were a number
of churches in Sydney

05:41.813 --> 05:43.986
that were like 50 to 100 people,

05:44.019 --> 05:46.861
and yet Frank had 1,000
in the space of a year.

05:46.895 --> 05:48.165
(upbeat rock music continues)

05:48.199 --> 05:49.804
- I was a window cleaner,

05:49.837 --> 05:52.679
and then eventually became
an assistant pastor.

05:52.713 --> 05:55.520
From there, planted
three different churches.

05:55.554 --> 05:58.998
The third one was what
now is Hillsong Church.

05:59.031 --> 06:01.070
Give someone a warm
hug or a handshake

06:01.104 --> 06:03.211
and welcome people to church.

06:03.244 --> 06:05.685
Amen!
(congregation chattering)

06:05.718 --> 06:07.658
- Brian really
appreciated the role

06:07.691 --> 06:10.767
that music played in
his father's services,

06:10.800 --> 06:14.945
so really early in the process
of starting his own church,

06:14.979 --> 06:17.754
he teamed up with a very
talented professional musician

06:17.788 --> 06:19.860
named Geoff Bullock.

06:19.894 --> 06:22.669
- I spoke to the then worship
pastor in my dad's church

06:22.703 --> 06:24.240
and says, "Can you help us out

06:24.274 --> 06:27.115
with someone to play piano
and give us some music?"

06:27.148 --> 06:29.690
And he says, "Well, I can
only give you Geoff Bullock."

06:29.724 --> 06:31.195
(tense music)
(congregation laughing)

06:31.228 --> 06:33.969
- The early days of Hills
Christian Life Center.

06:34.003 --> 06:37.748
We started in August, '83
with an out-of-tune piano

06:37.781 --> 06:39.987
on the stage of Baulkham
Hills Public School.

06:41.760 --> 06:46.005
By summer '84, we had maybe
100, 150 people in the church.

06:47.711 --> 06:48.647
A lot of musicians'd
come from other churches.

06:48.680 --> 06:49.683
(tense music continues)

06:49.717 --> 06:51.588
Brian and I are floating around

06:51.623 --> 06:52.859
our above-ground swimming pools

06:52.893 --> 06:54.230
pretending to be millionaires.

06:54.264 --> 06:55.968
And that's when I said to Brian,

06:56.002 --> 06:58.576
"We should call the
music team Hillsong."

06:59.379 --> 07:01.050
He said, "Why would we do that?"

07:01.084 --> 07:02.756
And I said, "Well,
it's better than saying

07:02.789 --> 07:04.662
the Hills Christian
Life Centre Music Team."

07:05.898 --> 07:09.108
So that's when the
name Hillsong was born.

07:09.141 --> 07:11.080
The thing exploded.

07:11.114 --> 07:12.686
(tape clicks)

07:12.719 --> 07:17.333
The Brian I remember was
a bit of a goofy guy.

07:17.366 --> 07:19.606
(gentle orchestral music)

07:19.639 --> 07:22.983
- He was quite a Ned
Flanders-looking character.

07:23.016 --> 07:25.189
- And we just really
love to have you here

07:25.223 --> 07:26.627
and wanna encourage you

07:26.661 --> 07:28.266
just to be a part
of what God's doing.

07:28.299 --> 07:30.673
- I found him so average.

07:30.706 --> 07:33.982
I didn't really think he
was going to go anywhere.

07:34.016 --> 07:36.356
(gentle orchestral
music continues)

07:36.390 --> 07:38.094
Who knew?

07:38.128 --> 07:39.834
- When Brian started preaching,

07:39.867 --> 07:42.374
his eyes would blink flat out.

07:42.408 --> 07:45.383
(gentle orchestral
music continues)

07:45.417 --> 07:47.656
- He wasn't the world's
greatest preacher,

07:47.691 --> 07:49.195
but he was full of enthusiasm.

07:49.229 --> 07:51.067
He was very entrepreneurial.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.404
- You can see the potential.

07:52.438 --> 07:53.842
- God, I'm believing to see

07:53.876 --> 07:56.885
a mighty revival in
this part of the city.

07:56.918 --> 07:58.389
How many can believe for that?

07:58.422 --> 07:59.827
Hallelujah!
(congregation clapping)

07:59.860 --> 08:01.030
- And he was the type
of person that you,

08:01.063 --> 08:02.401
not only wanted to like,

08:02.434 --> 08:04.407
but you wanted him to like you.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.313
(gentle orchestral
music continues)

08:06.346 --> 08:10.927
I think Brian was always
trying to impress his father

08:10.960 --> 08:12.431
and follow in his
father's shoes,

08:12.464 --> 08:14.738
but not to do it
like his father.

08:14.772 --> 08:19.151
- So praise God!
(congregation applauding)

08:20.856 --> 08:24.367
- In 1989, six years after
starting Hills Christian Centre,

08:24.400 --> 08:26.306
Brian took a trip to
the United States.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.144
(gentle music)

08:28.178 --> 08:32.458
1989 America was like real
excess and very few apologies.

08:32.491 --> 08:34.430
Americans were just
doing it more and bigger.

08:34.464 --> 08:35.868
(gentle music continues)

08:35.901 --> 08:38.041
Brian hooked up with a
lot of American pastors

08:38.074 --> 08:40.448
who were teaching the
prosperity gospel.

08:40.482 --> 08:43.524
They teach that if you
give money to the church,

08:43.557 --> 08:45.397
God will give you money
and good health in return.

08:45.430 --> 08:46.968
- Someone had a growth.

08:47.001 --> 08:48.339
I just saw a growth
being healed.

08:48.372 --> 08:51.180
- The message that's
being preached:

08:51.214 --> 08:54.825
power is good, and you
should ask God for power.

08:54.858 --> 08:58.369
Money is good, and you should
absolutely ask God for money,

08:58.402 --> 09:01.278
and the success that you have
is a sign of God's blessing.

09:01.311 --> 09:02.381
- I like new money.

09:02.414 --> 09:04.019
I don't know if you do.

09:04.052 --> 09:05.323
But I hate old money
that's wrinkled and dirty

09:05.357 --> 09:07.196
and got all the diseases on it.

09:07.229 --> 09:09.937
- [Kristin] So it's an
incredibly effective way

09:09.970 --> 09:12.411
to amass money and power

09:12.444 --> 09:14.484
if you're trying to
build a religious empire.

09:14.517 --> 09:16.188
(gentle music continues)

09:16.223 --> 09:18.094
- When God speaks to you,
I know He'll bless you.

09:18.128 --> 09:21.505
- It also is very
much prone to abuse,

09:21.538 --> 09:23.210
(gentle music continues)

09:23.244 --> 09:26.185
because anybody who has power

09:26.219 --> 09:29.027
to speak for God can
make demands of you.

09:29.061 --> 09:30.498
- Then if you could
send a gift of $50.

09:30.532 --> 09:32.136
(gentle music continues)

09:32.170 --> 09:34.377
- And I want you to make
a $1,000 vow of faith.

09:34.410 --> 09:38.924
Oh, I know you probably don't
have $1,000, but vow it.

09:38.957 --> 09:42.334
- Prosperity preachers are
manipulating people to give,

09:42.367 --> 09:45.477
not to bless people, but
to line their own pockets.

09:45.510 --> 09:47.382
(gentle music continues)

09:47.416 --> 09:49.288
- It benefits the people who
are preaching the gospel.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.692
It doesn't benefit the faithful.

09:50.725 --> 09:52.331
(congregation clapping)

09:52.364 --> 09:55.573
That was the culture that Brian
caught in the United States,

09:55.607 --> 09:58.282
and so he came back
and really made a shift

09:58.315 --> 10:01.090
from an Assemblies of
God Pentecostalism,

10:01.123 --> 10:04.099
which is pretty blue collar,

10:04.132 --> 10:07.008
and really money
became the center

10:07.041 --> 10:08.111
of what the church
was all about.

10:08.144 --> 10:10.618
(upbeat music)

10:14.730 --> 10:16.470
(upbeat music continues)

10:16.503 --> 10:18.977
- [Announcer] Brian
Houston presents "Money".

10:19.010 --> 10:20.315
- There's not one
person in this building

10:20.348 --> 10:23.324
who doesn't need more money.

10:23.357 --> 10:24.560
♪ Wake up, wake up, wake up ♪

10:24.594 --> 10:25.730
- What an awesome thing it is

10:25.763 --> 10:27.436
to have you as
part of our world.

10:27.469 --> 10:29.174
- [Announcer] To purchase
any of the products

10:29.208 --> 10:31.548
you've just seen, write
to Hillsong Australia.

10:31.581 --> 10:33.086
- [Kristin] "You
Need More Money".

10:33.119 --> 10:34.257
- You'll say, I am rich!

10:35.727 --> 10:38.134
- Brian ended up writing that
book, "You Need More Money".

10:39.572 --> 10:42.481
I think what he meant
was he wanted more money.

10:42.514 --> 10:45.790
- All of a sudden, we're
talking about Ferragamo shoes

10:45.823 --> 10:48.064
and Armani suits.
(upbeat music continues)

10:48.097 --> 10:49.769
And every time we went anywhere,

10:49.802 --> 10:51.808
we had to get a
Gianni Versace tie

10:51.841 --> 10:55.486
or we had to get
Gianni Versace socks.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.529
I remember laughing
one day and thinking,

10:58.562 --> 11:00.702
Gianni Versace's the
patron saint of Hillsong.

11:00.735 --> 11:04.213
(upbeat music continues)

11:04.247 --> 11:07.088
- Then you saw this
real deliberate attempt

11:07.121 --> 11:08.392
to reinvent himself in the image

11:08.425 --> 11:10.531
of what he thought
would be most attractive

11:10.565 --> 11:11.701
to potential followers,

11:11.735 --> 11:15.246
which was very
heavily fake tanned,

11:15.280 --> 11:16.650
he's got bleach-white teeth,

11:16.683 --> 11:18.389
he's got ripped arms.

11:18.422 --> 11:19.625
- That's 29!

11:19.659 --> 11:20.561
That's 30!

11:22.367 --> 11:23.169
- [David] He's
really the alpha male

11:23.203 --> 11:25.175
in the room, and
everyone knows it.

11:25.209 --> 11:27.516
- Would you all say it
with me? Spiritually alive?

11:27.549 --> 11:30.291
Spiritually alive!

11:30.325 --> 11:32.497
- They ended up
hiring a consultant.

11:32.531 --> 11:35.138
Brian said, "Look, I'm
gonna hire this guy.

11:35.172 --> 11:38.315
He costs $50,000, and
he's going to teach us

11:38.349 --> 11:40.888
how to raise funds so we
can spread the gospel."

11:40.923 --> 11:45.236
Recruitment and growth were
very strong focal points.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.743
There also seemed
to be an increase

11:47.776 --> 11:50.150
in opportunities to donate.

11:50.183 --> 11:52.658
- Are you serving Jesus tonight?

11:52.691 --> 11:53.928
- The church got bigger.

11:53.962 --> 11:55.934
We moved into the
warehouse next door,

11:55.968 --> 11:57.071
knocked the wall down.

11:57.104 --> 11:58.909
And then we moved into the
local entertainment center,

11:58.943 --> 12:00.381
1,500 people.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.186
Then we bought more
and more equipment.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.657
Then we started
recording albums.

12:03.691 --> 12:05.496
We formed a publishing company.

12:05.530 --> 12:08.205
We did all these music
books, and it was...

12:09.742 --> 12:10.745
Well, it was exhausting.

12:10.778 --> 12:13.152
(tense music)

12:14.423 --> 12:15.326
- [Alex] You're not
there for Jesus.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.599
You're there for Brian Houston.

12:17.632 --> 12:19.338
- Why don't we just stay
standing for a moment?

12:19.372 --> 12:21.778
- He shows up on Sunday
in a chauffeured car.

12:21.811 --> 12:23.250
He gets in an elevator

12:23.283 --> 12:25.656
that takes him to a
private green room.

12:25.690 --> 12:27.863
He loves to hobnob
with celebrities.

12:27.896 --> 12:30.571
He goes out into
the church space

12:30.605 --> 12:32.377
and he sits in a roped off area.

12:32.411 --> 12:34.417
(tense music continues)

12:34.450 --> 12:35.686
- Brian Houston acted

12:35.720 --> 12:38.829
as a sort of spiritual
father to Carl Lentz.

12:38.862 --> 12:40.000
Carl learned a lot from Brian

12:40.033 --> 12:41.638
in terms of how to run a church,

12:41.671 --> 12:43.277
how to operate in a green room

12:43.310 --> 12:44.981
with celebrities and athletes.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.987
Carl also brought
something to the table

12:47.021 --> 12:48.559
that Brian didn't have.

12:48.592 --> 12:49.862
Carl, by all accounts,

12:49.895 --> 12:52.604
is a great speaker and
a charismatic presence.

12:52.637 --> 12:54.510
Brian's never really
been praised for that.

12:54.543 --> 12:56.449
He's been known
more for brute force

12:56.483 --> 12:59.959
and for making things
happen by whichever means.

12:59.993 --> 13:01.831
- My faith, my strength.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.937
(congregation applauding)

13:09.455 --> 13:12.798
(congregation applauding)

13:17.879 --> 13:20.454
(tense music)

13:24.466 --> 13:27.742
- I met Brian when I
was 15 years of age.

13:27.776 --> 13:29.013
Our friendship grew.

13:29.047 --> 13:31.421
And when Brian started
Christian Life Centre,

13:31.454 --> 13:33.994
I was asked to go in
and pastor the church.

13:36.101 --> 13:37.772
- Back in the day,
Christian Life Centre

13:37.806 --> 13:40.781
had some pretty strict
boundaries for young people.

13:40.815 --> 13:44.092
(tense music continues)

13:44.125 --> 13:46.633
- Youth group was about
resisting the flesh,

13:46.666 --> 13:48.672
resisting those urges

13:48.705 --> 13:51.781
and keeping yourself
kind of for marriage.

13:51.814 --> 13:53.954
(tense music continues)

13:53.987 --> 13:56.128
And I actually became pregnant.

13:58.167 --> 14:00.708
My partner was 19 and I was 20.

14:00.741 --> 14:02.414
(tense music continues)

14:02.447 --> 14:03.717
We were really shocked.

14:05.590 --> 14:08.565
We didn't think it was
unreasonable to go to the church

14:08.599 --> 14:10.738
and say, "We need
help, we need support."

14:10.771 --> 14:12.444
(tense music continues)

14:12.477 --> 14:15.886
But unfortunately, we
couldn't have been more wrong.

14:15.920 --> 14:20.166
(tense music continues)

14:20.201 --> 14:23.109
The youth pastor approached
us and said to us,

14:23.142 --> 14:27.489
"The next step for you is to
stand up in front of your peers

14:27.522 --> 14:29.662
and apologize for
what you've done."

14:29.695 --> 14:32.068
(eerie music)

14:33.807 --> 14:37.919
I can't even begin to
describe the shock,

14:39.123 --> 14:42.967
the trauma, the
embarrassment, the shame

14:43.001 --> 14:44.606
that we went through
in that moment.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.144
(eerie music continues)

14:46.178 --> 14:51.058
The look on people's
faces, their shock,

14:52.731 --> 14:53.333
their sense of embarrassment.
(eerie music continues)

14:53.367 --> 14:55.004
Nobody knew where to look.

14:56.542 --> 14:57.946
They couldn't look
at us in the eye.

14:57.979 --> 15:01.123
(eerie music continues)

15:13.024 --> 15:15.766
(eerie music continues)

15:15.800 --> 15:18.106
- This is something that I've
only started thinking about

15:18.140 --> 15:19.645
in the last few years,

15:20.948 --> 15:24.226
is the cost of what
was taken from me

15:24.259 --> 15:28.939
in terms of this being
my very first pregnancy,

15:28.972 --> 15:32.115
my very first child.
(eerie music continues)

15:32.149 --> 15:33.887
I was ashamed to be pregnant.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.960
(eerie music continues)

15:35.993 --> 15:37.332
All the emotional stuff

15:37.365 --> 15:39.872
that we went through
made me physically sick.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.847
I was physically sick
throughout my whole pregnancy.

15:43.950 --> 15:47.093
(eerie music continues)

15:47.126 --> 15:50.638
Like, gravely ill.

15:50.671 --> 15:53.246
(eerie music continues)

15:53.280 --> 15:55.820
All we had was this
church environment,

15:55.853 --> 15:59.062
and here they were now
treating us like pariahs.

15:59.095 --> 16:02.273
(eerie music continues)

16:18.455 --> 16:19.791
- Wow.

16:19.825 --> 16:22.433
Well, to put a person
up on a platform

16:22.467 --> 16:25.209
and shame them, and
it was in our church?

16:25.242 --> 16:26.345
- Mm-hm.
- Wow.

16:26.379 --> 16:28.818
(eerie music continues)

16:28.852 --> 16:30.257
Blatantly wrong.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.931
And if I was
responsible for that,

16:32.964 --> 16:35.773
which as the senior
pastor, I am,

16:35.806 --> 16:37.879
then I was totally out
of order, totally wrong.

16:40.118 --> 16:42.927
Jesus said, leave the
99 and go after the one.

16:44.833 --> 16:48.042
But when I started our
church, I have to confess,

16:49.448 --> 16:52.088
I saw crowds, I didn't
see individuals.

16:52.121 --> 16:53.226
(eerie music continues)

16:53.260 --> 16:54.329
We have a lot to answer for.

16:56.535 --> 16:58.139
A lot to answer for.

16:58.172 --> 17:01.250
(eerie music continues)

17:01.284 --> 17:04.124
- As far as a sense of holiness,

17:04.157 --> 17:09.005
a sense of accountability
to people's internal life,

17:10.511 --> 17:14.020
it was about counting
numbers and counting money.

17:14.054 --> 17:15.259
(eerie music continues)

17:15.292 --> 17:19.169
I always felt that
Brian was out to prove

17:19.203 --> 17:22.447
that he could go one
further than his father.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.889
(eerie music continues)

17:25.923 --> 17:28.365
(car rumbling)

17:29.267 --> 17:32.174
(tense music)

17:32.209 --> 17:35.050
- Brian Houston's
father, Frank Houston,

17:35.083 --> 17:38.092
had this very mundane life.

17:38.126 --> 17:39.564
(tense music continues)

17:39.598 --> 17:41.837
It was hard for him
to make a living.

17:41.871 --> 17:43.843
There wasn't much
money coming in.

17:43.877 --> 17:47.086
And he meets this
Pentecostal preacher,

17:47.119 --> 17:50.431
a real fire-and-brimstone
charismatic-style preacher,

17:50.464 --> 17:52.001
and something just
clicked with him.

17:52.034 --> 17:53.373
(tense music continues)

17:53.406 --> 17:57.919
He could be the living
embodiment of God on the stage,

17:57.952 --> 17:59.424
the Holy Spirit
racing through him

17:59.458 --> 18:01.430
and impassion a crowd of people

18:01.464 --> 18:02.967
who would follow him anywhere,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.439
who would do anything for him.

18:04.473 --> 18:06.345
(tense music continues)

18:06.378 --> 18:07.982
I think, for Frank,

18:08.015 --> 18:10.524
that was everything that
he ever wanted to be.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.097
(tense music continues)

18:13.131 --> 18:15.439
- So Frank started his
career as a minister

18:15.472 --> 18:18.348
at a Salvation Army boys'
home in New Zealand.

18:18.381 --> 18:20.286
(tense music continues)

18:20.320 --> 18:21.924
He left there

18:21.957 --> 18:23.161
and went to a small town
outside of Wellington

18:23.195 --> 18:24.332
called Lower Hutt.

18:24.366 --> 18:26.271
(tense music continues)

18:26.304 --> 18:28.478
Lower Hutt was working class,

18:28.511 --> 18:31.018
the people knew each other well,

18:31.051 --> 18:34.362
and he founded an Assemblies
of God Church there.

18:34.396 --> 18:36.133
(tense music continues)

18:36.166 --> 18:39.611
- My family attended Lower
Hutt Assembly of God Church

18:39.644 --> 18:42.151
for probably 15, 20 years.
(tense music continues)

18:42.184 --> 18:44.559
My father was an elder
at Lower Hutt AOG,

18:44.593 --> 18:47.401
so he was quite friendly
with the Houstons.

18:47.435 --> 18:50.108
(audience applauding)

18:50.142 --> 18:51.514
- Well, good morning, church.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.717
- [Congregation] Good morning.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.556
- How are you today?
Everybody happy?

18:54.589 --> 18:56.261
- [Congregation] Yes!

18:56.294 --> 18:57.532
- Assemblies of God at the
time that Frank Houston

18:57.565 --> 19:00.774
became involved was not
a large church movement

19:00.807 --> 19:05.254
in New Zealand, but
Frank Houston wanted
the church to grow,

19:05.288 --> 19:07.327
and he was really
good at this, too.

19:07.361 --> 19:09.734
(bright music)

19:09.768 --> 19:12.041
From that humble beginning

19:12.074 --> 19:15.183
of just a handful of
congregations across the country

19:15.218 --> 19:17.290
to there being about
700 congregations

19:17.324 --> 19:20.031
across the country, it grew.

19:20.065 --> 19:22.707
(congregants clapping)
(bright music continues)

19:22.740 --> 19:26.518
And so when it came
to appointing a leader

19:26.552 --> 19:28.357
of that church community,

19:28.391 --> 19:29.828
Frank Houston was
there and ready for it.

19:29.861 --> 19:31.700
(bright music continues)

19:31.734 --> 19:34.809
There were church elders
in Assemblies of God,

19:34.843 --> 19:37.852
and they had degrees of
influence themselves,

19:37.885 --> 19:41.296
but Frank Houston
didn't want that.

19:41.329 --> 19:44.103
- Instead of voting
for board members,

19:44.137 --> 19:46.845
he took that apart
and basically said,

19:46.879 --> 19:48.718
I'm gonna handpick
the board members.

19:48.751 --> 19:49.487
I am the leader.
(bright music continues)

19:49.521 --> 19:52.262
- Matthew 5:1-12.

19:53.332 --> 19:55.304
- He was a very forceful person,

19:55.338 --> 19:59.283
and someone who you never
ever wanted to argue with.

19:59.316 --> 20:03.630
- He would throw things at
people like cushions and water.

20:03.663 --> 20:07.172
I just remember being
very fearful in church.

20:08.778 --> 20:11.854
I think when we heard, oh,
don't be alone with Frank,

20:11.887 --> 20:14.529
it was always a bit of a
joke because it was like,

20:14.562 --> 20:16.200
well, why wouldn't
you be alone with him?

20:16.234 --> 20:19.175
You wanted to hang with God.
(bright music continues)

20:19.209 --> 20:20.580
- [Alex] Frank Houston practiced

20:20.614 --> 20:22.787
an oppressive style
of leadership.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.462
He shamed people,
he humiliated them.

20:25.495 --> 20:26.899
(bright music continues)

20:26.932 --> 20:29.708
- But it's not only Frank,
because Brian Houston,

20:29.741 --> 20:31.580
he goes out on his
own and he starts

20:31.613 --> 20:33.653
his own congregation up.
(bright music continues)

20:33.686 --> 20:35.959
- [Alex] What he
does is really mimic

20:35.992 --> 20:37.832
the leadership structure

20:37.865 --> 20:40.507
that Frank had installed
at his own church.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.510
(bright music continues)

20:41.543 --> 20:44.218
- There's really
interesting parallels there.

20:44.251 --> 20:47.260
All the power in the church
centers on its leader.

20:47.293 --> 20:49.501
Frank Houston had no one

20:49.534 --> 20:50.737
that would stop him
or question him.

20:50.771 --> 20:53.846
I can't see that at
Hillsong, either.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.752
The accountabilities,
the safety nets,

20:55.786 --> 20:57.491
they seemed absent in both.

21:01.570 --> 21:02.973
(no audio)

21:03.007 --> 21:04.512
- [Director] Was there
ever any rumors about Frank

21:04.546 --> 21:05.782
back in those times?
- Rumors?

21:08.991 --> 21:13.305
I think there were
question marks.

21:13.338 --> 21:13.840
But,

21:16.079 --> 21:20.694
well, he just seemed
to be always surrounded

21:20.727 --> 21:25.509
with young men.
(ominous music)

21:25.542 --> 21:27.715
(children chattering)
(ominous music continues)

21:27.748 --> 21:32.496
- Frank Houston's influence in
the Assemblies of God Church

21:32.530 --> 21:34.702
grew out throughout the country.

21:34.736 --> 21:36.407
(water whooshing)

21:36.440 --> 21:39.884
He often talked about the
church that he'd dreamt of.

21:39.918 --> 21:40.954
(ominous music continues)

21:40.987 --> 21:43.361
You could sense
that inside of him

21:43.395 --> 21:46.036
was a passion to build a church

21:46.069 --> 21:48.443
in Australia, too.
(ominous music continues)

21:48.476 --> 21:50.550
(traffic whooshing)

21:50.584 --> 21:52.723
- Oh, everybody thought that
Frank going to Australia

21:52.756 --> 21:54.963
was the greatest thing
that ever happened.

21:54.996 --> 21:56.400
It was the call of God.
(ominous music continues)

21:56.434 --> 21:58.574
He had to go. He
didn't have a choice.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.111
Frank had a vision.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.850
(ominous music continues)
(waves whooshing)

22:01.884 --> 22:03.956
Later on, we find out
that there was rumblings

22:03.990 --> 22:06.029
in the undergrowth,
and Frank ran.

22:06.062 --> 22:08.092
(ominous music continues)

22:12.850 --> 22:15.524
(somber music)

22:18.279 --> 22:19.292
- [David] Sometimes
there are moments

22:19.325 --> 22:21.298
in politics that surprise you.
(somber music continues)

22:21.331 --> 22:24.507
- Do we need a royal
commission? By hell we do.

22:24.540 --> 22:27.550
(audience applauding)

22:27.583 --> 22:31.261
- When finally the
announcement was made

22:31.294 --> 22:33.467
two years after that
town hall meeting,

22:33.500 --> 22:35.473
(somber music continues)

22:35.506 --> 22:37.479
I really couldn't
believe it had happened.

22:39.051 --> 22:43.330
- Okay, everybody's ready?
(tense music)

22:45.069 --> 22:46.272
I'm here to announce that
I will be recommending

22:46.306 --> 22:49.583
to the governor-general that a
royal commission be appointed

22:49.616 --> 22:52.925
to inquire into
institutional responses

22:52.960 --> 22:57.539
to instances and allegations
of child abuse in Australia.

22:57.573 --> 22:58.576
(tense music continues)

22:58.610 --> 23:00.481
- The phone just
started ringing,

23:00.515 --> 23:03.323
and there was survivor after
survivor after survivor

23:03.357 --> 23:08.072
calling in tears saying, "I
can't believe it's happened."

23:08.105 --> 23:10.378
This was it, this was the chance

23:10.411 --> 23:13.387
to finally hold any institution

23:13.420 --> 23:15.561
that had abused kids to account.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.232
(tense music continues)

23:17.265 --> 23:19.271
What was happening in
Australia was a microcosm

23:19.305 --> 23:22.548
of what we saw happening
around the rest of the planet.

23:22.582 --> 23:25.423
- Devastating detail
how the past leadership

23:25.456 --> 23:27.496
of the Southern
Baptist Convention

23:27.529 --> 23:30.037
ignored sexual abuse allegations

23:30.071 --> 23:32.177
for the better part
of two decades.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.651
- Thousands of former
Boy Scout volunteers

23:34.684 --> 23:39.131
accused of sexually abusing
children between 1944 and 2016.

23:39.165 --> 23:41.304
- For more than 150
years, an old system

23:41.337 --> 23:42.575
of boarding schools.

23:42.608 --> 23:44.280
- [Reporter] Which
priests were known

23:44.313 --> 23:45.316
to be the abusive priests?
(tense music continues)

23:45.349 --> 23:47.924
- This was a global failure.

23:47.957 --> 23:51.468
It felt like the moment had
arrived around the world.

23:52.738 --> 23:56.316
So much of the story
up to that point

23:56.349 --> 23:58.222
had been about the
Catholic Church,

23:58.255 --> 23:59.993
and there's a reason for that.

24:00.027 --> 24:02.635
It's the most dominant
church in Australia.

24:02.668 --> 24:04.340
And then eventually,

24:04.373 --> 24:07.349
we had survivors and
victims of Hillsong.

24:07.382 --> 24:10.592
(tense music continues)

24:10.626 --> 24:13.033
- One of the most notable
voices was an Australian man

24:13.066 --> 24:15.540
who was identified
by the initials AHA.

24:17.145 --> 24:18.015
- I call AHA.

24:20.756 --> 24:24.133
Mr. AHA, I wonder if you could

24:25.704 --> 24:28.278
please read your statement
out to the Royal Commission.

24:28.312 --> 24:30.218
- [AHA] I'll do my best.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.157
(ominous music)

24:32.190 --> 24:35.767
In January 1970, I
recall that Pastor Frank

24:35.801 --> 24:39.646
and his son, Brian, stayed with
us for almost a whole week.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.585
I'm aware of the date

24:41.619 --> 24:44.661
because Pastor Frank signed
and dated my mother's bible.

24:45.731 --> 24:48.673
(ominous music continues)

24:48.706 --> 24:53.353
- My wife told me about the
Australian royal commission,

24:54.223 --> 24:57.432
and I had no idea

24:57.465 --> 24:59.371
about what it was all about.

24:59.405 --> 25:00.676
- [Beckett] Mr.
AHA, could you read

25:00.709 --> 25:03.483
the entry for 5th of November?

25:03.517 --> 25:05.122
- I listened very intently

25:05.156 --> 25:07.663
and downloaded all the
documents associated with it,

25:07.697 --> 25:11.341
and started to really,
really get into it

25:11.374 --> 25:14.416
and understand what had happened
and what it was all about.

25:14.450 --> 25:17.693
- [AHA] Pastor Frank would creep
into my room late at night,

25:17.727 --> 25:19.899
and then I would wake up
with him standing over me.

25:19.933 --> 25:21.739
(ominous music continues)

25:21.772 --> 25:24.614
He was touching me
inappropriately.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.556
I would be petrified and
would lay very still.

25:28.793 --> 25:30.599
I could not speak while
this was happening

25:30.632 --> 25:32.270
and felt like I
couldn't breathe.

25:32.304 --> 25:33.741
(ominous music continues)

25:33.775 --> 25:35.881
I'm not sure how long he would
stay in the room with me,

25:35.914 --> 25:37.319
but it felt like forever.

25:37.352 --> 25:39.191
(ominous music continues)

25:39.224 --> 25:40.929
- This is exactly
what happened to me.

25:40.962 --> 25:44.506
(ominous music continues)

25:44.540 --> 25:46.245
When I was eight years old,

25:46.279 --> 25:48.920
my parents started holding
a Bible study in our home.

25:48.953 --> 25:50.491
(ominous music continues)

25:50.524 --> 25:52.698
Frank would come for
a meal beforehand,

25:52.732 --> 25:55.406
and then us kids
would be sent to bed.

25:55.439 --> 25:58.783
(ominous music continues)

26:00.689 --> 26:02.260
This thing came into my bedroom

26:02.293 --> 26:04.667
that I called the black shadow.

26:04.701 --> 26:08.478
And I would sense
it there first,

26:08.512 --> 26:10.919
and then I'd feel its
weight on top of me

26:10.952 --> 26:13.728
and I'd feel breath on my face.

26:16.001 --> 26:17.405
(ominous music continues)
And I was

26:24.594 --> 26:25.496
fondled.

26:25.529 --> 26:28.806
(ominous music continues)

26:33.588 --> 26:36.730
I always had a suspicion
that something had happened,

26:36.764 --> 26:38.235
that it was Frank, that it was

26:39.806 --> 26:42.380
that sexual interaction that
happened when I was young,

26:42.413 --> 26:43.316
when I was eight,

26:43.350 --> 26:45.422
but I didn't really know.

26:45.456 --> 26:47.362
I didn't really know
for a long, long time.

26:47.395 --> 26:48.866
(ominous music continues)

26:48.900 --> 26:52.745
But when I read the Australian
royal commission testimony,

26:52.778 --> 26:57.626
that was the moment when I
knew without a shadow of doubt

26:57.660 --> 27:00.735
that the black shadow
was Frank Houston.

27:00.769 --> 27:04.346
(ominous music continues)

27:08.559 --> 27:10.331
- [AHA] I was so
ashamed of the abuse

27:10.364 --> 27:11.969
that I kept it
inside for many years

27:12.002 --> 27:15.111
and did not tell anyone.
(ominous music continues)

27:15.144 --> 27:19.458
It was only on or about 1978
when I was about 16 years old

27:19.491 --> 27:22.601
that I told my mother
about the abuse.

27:22.635 --> 27:24.406
My mother was still
heavily involved

27:24.439 --> 27:25.610
in the church at that time.

27:26.947 --> 27:29.153
All of her friends were
involved in the church,

27:29.186 --> 27:30.859
and the Houstons were considered

27:30.892 --> 27:33.701
to be almost like
royalty in those circles.

27:33.734 --> 27:34.704
(ominous music continues)

27:34.737 --> 27:36.810
After I told her
about the abuse,

27:38.113 --> 27:41.022
my mother said words to
the following effect.

27:41.056 --> 27:43.698
"You don't want to be
responsible for turning people

27:43.731 --> 27:45.904
from the church and
sending them to hell."

27:45.937 --> 27:50.819
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

27:51.822 --> 27:53.928
- I told my parents about it,

27:53.961 --> 27:56.067
and they thought
it was a nightmare.

27:56.101 --> 27:59.879
They were so naive and
so enamored about Frank

27:59.912 --> 28:02.185
that that was not
even on their radar.

28:02.219 --> 28:03.624
(ominous music continues)

28:03.658 --> 28:06.566
And I remember taking
a piece of wood to bed,

28:06.600 --> 28:08.906
a four by two, so I
could bang on the wall

28:08.939 --> 28:11.715
when the black shadow came
so they could hear me.

28:11.748 --> 28:14.155
(ominous music continues)

28:14.188 --> 28:18.167
And it happened

28:18.200 --> 28:19.471
quite a few times.

28:19.504 --> 28:22.881
(ominous music continues)

28:24.854 --> 28:28.933
This is a photograph
of me taken in 1962.

28:28.966 --> 28:30.236
I was eight years old.

28:30.270 --> 28:33.045
(ominous music continues)

28:33.078 --> 28:36.154
The boy in this picture is a boy

28:36.187 --> 28:37.124
that had already

28:39.966 --> 28:43.744
encountered childhood
sexual abuse.

28:43.778 --> 28:47.120
(ominous music continues)

28:48.626 --> 28:50.799
I didn't really
have any friends.

28:52.771 --> 28:56.583
It would be unlikely
that anything I said
would be believed.

29:04.640 --> 29:09.321
(somber music)
(traffic whooshing)

29:12.162 --> 29:15.204
(heartbeat thudding)

29:15.238 --> 29:18.213
- I'd been reading
survivor blogs.

29:18.247 --> 29:20.722
One of the things
that I came across

29:20.755 --> 29:23.095
that I really
wasn't expecting to

29:23.128 --> 29:26.673
was just how much
conservative Evangelicals

29:26.706 --> 29:28.043
emphasized authority.

29:29.381 --> 29:31.286
You show your obedience to God

29:31.319 --> 29:35.031
by being faithful and
submissive to people

29:35.064 --> 29:37.204
that God has placed
in charge of you.

29:37.237 --> 29:39.043
(tense music)

29:39.076 --> 29:43.055
They set people up for
abuse of leadership.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.836
And when I listened to
the voices of survivors,

29:47.870 --> 29:50.812
members of their own
communities, their own churches,

29:50.845 --> 29:55.291
sometimes even
their own families
questioned their stories

29:56.796 --> 29:59.772
in order to continue to
protect the ministry.

29:59.805 --> 30:03.851
(tense music continues)

30:03.884 --> 30:05.422
- There was a
number of young boys

30:05.455 --> 30:10.036
who said things
about Frank Houston,

30:11.339 --> 30:14.248
criticism of him in
a way that resulted

30:14.281 --> 30:16.054
in them either being
thrown out of the church

30:16.087 --> 30:19.966
or being ostracized
by leadership.

30:19.999 --> 30:21.805
(tense music continues)

30:21.838 --> 30:25.984
There was an occasion
where one young man came in

30:26.017 --> 30:28.959
and said Frank Houston had been
doing physical things to him

30:28.993 --> 30:31.299
that he didn't like

30:31.332 --> 30:33.774
and accused him in front of
one of the other pastors.

30:33.807 --> 30:35.445
The other pastor actually
physically punched

30:35.479 --> 30:37.986
this kid in the face and said,

30:38.020 --> 30:41.296
"Don't you ever, ever talk
about our pastor like that."

30:41.329 --> 30:44.974
(tense music continues)

30:45.007 --> 30:46.980
- Nobody came forward
to the police,

30:48.050 --> 30:51.192
a
nd I think that says a lot
about his hold on the police.

30:51.225 --> 30:52.362
(tense music continues)

30:52.395 --> 30:55.840
Any accounts of abuse most
certainly would've been squashed

30:55.873 --> 30:59.819
by Frank and the people
that he sort of lorded over

30:59.852 --> 31:01.457
at the AOG.
(tense music continues)

31:01.490 --> 31:03.463
You know, we're gonna
keep this in the church.

31:06.170 --> 31:09.982
- The motivation to keep Frank
Houston's offending quiet

31:10.016 --> 31:12.022
would've been huge.
(tense music continues)

31:12.055 --> 31:14.094
For New Zealand
Assemblies of God,

31:14.128 --> 31:17.471
they were protecting something
that was all about the past.

31:18.474 --> 31:20.212
For Australia Assemblies of God,

31:20.246 --> 31:22.318
they were protecting the future,

31:22.352 --> 31:24.358
and that future was huge.

31:24.391 --> 31:27.602
(tense music continues)

31:29.039 --> 31:30.878
(keyboard clacking)

31:30.912 --> 31:35.358
I started looking into Frank
Houston and Assemblies of God

31:36.629 --> 31:37.833
as a result of the
Australian commission.

31:39.370 --> 31:42.412
There were documents that
were put into evidence

31:42.445 --> 31:44.351
that spoke of things
happening in New Zealand

31:44.385 --> 31:46.290
that had never
been written about.

31:46.324 --> 31:47.360
(tense music continues)

31:47.394 --> 31:49.333
When Frank left in '75,

31:49.366 --> 31:53.680
he left behind decades of sexual
violence against children.

31:53.714 --> 31:55.987
(tense music continues)

31:56.020 --> 31:57.323
I thought I'd messed up

31:57.357 --> 31:59.062
the way I was searching
our news archives

31:59.096 --> 32:02.238
because I couldn't find
anything about Frank Houston.

32:02.272 --> 32:03.944
(tense music continues)

32:03.977 --> 32:06.653
It was really alarming.
(tense music continues)

32:06.686 --> 32:10.129
As it turned out, it hadn't
really been written about.

32:12.435 --> 32:16.481
There was a vacuum, and so
that's what I sought to fill.

32:16.515 --> 32:19.323
(tense music continues)

32:19.356 --> 32:22.365
- When I go back and look
at the timeline of events,

32:23.201 --> 32:25.007
it's almost surreal.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.649
(eerie music)

32:27.682 --> 32:30.156
I was raised in Hillsong
culture of forgive and forget,

32:30.189 --> 32:32.262
move on, judge not,

32:33.567 --> 32:35.404
for he who hasn't sinned
cast the first stone.

32:36.709 --> 32:39.483
And the more I've
learned about Frank,

32:39.517 --> 32:42.158
I'm realizing something
is so wrong here.

32:42.192 --> 32:43.697
(eerie music continues)

32:43.730 --> 32:45.703
I feel the responsibility
as a Christian to stand up

32:45.736 --> 32:47.609
and actually start speaking
out against the abuse.

32:47.642 --> 32:51.052
(eerie music continues)

32:52.355 --> 32:54.361
The Royal Commission
shed light on the fact

32:54.394 --> 32:57.370
that Hillsong was not honest
to their own congregants.

32:57.403 --> 32:58.675
(eerie music continues)

32:58.709 --> 33:01.584
It really helped start
me on a trajectory going,

33:01.618 --> 33:03.154
what else are they
not telling us?

33:03.188 --> 33:06.530
(eerie music continues)

33:06.566 --> 33:08.572
(water whooshing)

33:08.605 --> 33:10.409
- Trouble starts
for Frank and Brian

33:10.442 --> 33:12.415
really in November of 1998.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.488
(tense music)

33:14.521 --> 33:18.433
When AHA was a teenager, he
told his mother about the abuse,

33:18.466 --> 33:20.575
and she refused to believe him.

33:20.608 --> 33:22.312
And then, 20 years later,

33:22.345 --> 33:25.623
she reported the abuse
to an AOG pastor.

33:25.656 --> 33:26.558
- [AHA] My mother
called me and told me

33:26.593 --> 33:28.799
she had a conversation
with Pastor Mumford

33:28.832 --> 33:31.674
and told him that I had
been sexually abused

33:31.708 --> 33:34.114
by Pastor Frank.
(tense music continues)

33:34.147 --> 33:36.623
Both Pastor Taylor and
Pastor Mumford questioned me

33:36.656 --> 33:39.129
about the allegations
I had made.

33:39.162 --> 33:41.804
They tried to tell me that
what I was saying was not true,

33:41.838 --> 33:44.311
and they both said words
to the following effect.

33:44.344 --> 33:47.253
"Frank Houston couldn't have
done that, he's a good man."

33:47.287 --> 33:50.129
(tense music continues)

33:50.162 --> 33:54.241
- Frank first becomes aware
of the accusation that month.

33:54.274 --> 33:55.913
And instead of doing
anything about it,

33:55.946 --> 33:58.153
Frank decides he's
going to take a holiday.

33:58.186 --> 33:59.189
(children laughing)
(waves whooshing)

33:59.222 --> 34:01.462
In fact, he goes
on two holidays.

34:01.495 --> 34:04.471
Then in the first
week of May, 1999,

34:04.504 --> 34:08.852
Frank unexpectedly and very
suddenly gives the keys

34:08.885 --> 34:11.560
to his church to his
son, Brian Houston.

34:12.864 --> 34:15.873
AHA becomes fed up and
really doesn't think

34:15.906 --> 34:17.343
that anybody in the
church community

34:17.377 --> 34:19.618
is going to believe him
or take him seriously,

34:19.651 --> 34:22.191
so he tells an AOG pastor

34:22.225 --> 34:25.367
that he's considering
going to the authorities.

34:25.401 --> 34:27.273
(tense music continues)

34:27.306 --> 34:28.945
That's when things start
to happen pretty quickly.

34:28.979 --> 34:31.218
(tense music continues)

34:31.252 --> 34:34.930
That same week, Brian
Houston calls his father

34:34.963 --> 34:36.601
into his office

34:36.636 --> 34:39.645
and learns about the case
officially for the first time.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.415
Now, there are no
minutes from the meeting.

34:41.449 --> 34:42.821
There are no notes
from the meeting.

34:42.854 --> 34:44.391
There were no witnesses
to the meeting.

34:44.424 --> 34:45.896
(tense music continues)

34:45.930 --> 34:47.902
- It was the worst
meeting I ever had.

34:47.936 --> 34:48.738
I confronted him.

34:50.042 --> 34:51.948
He went extremely
dry in the mouth

34:51.981 --> 34:55.491
and said, "Yes, these
things did happen."

34:55.524 --> 34:56.996
- [Beckett] Well, I'll
just to stop you there,

34:57.029 --> 34:58.935
because that's the point
I wanted to ask you about.

34:58.969 --> 35:01.643
What did he actually confess to?

35:03.683 --> 35:04.686
- He confessed essentially
to fondling genitals.

35:08.429 --> 35:11.438
- [Beckett] All right,
of one or more children?

35:11.472 --> 35:12.609
(tense music continues)

35:12.643 --> 35:14.649
- We were only talking
about that one.

35:14.683 --> 35:18.059
At that time, he told me that
it was a one-off occasion.

35:18.092 --> 35:18.995
(tense music continues)

35:19.029 --> 35:20.399
- [AHA] The abuse in my home

35:20.432 --> 35:21.871
and at the different
church meetings

35:21.904 --> 35:25.683
continued over a period of
years until I reached puberty.

35:25.716 --> 35:28.624
What Pastor Frank did to
me destroyed my childhood.

35:29.862 --> 35:32.068
The abuse has had
longterm effects on me.

35:32.101 --> 35:33.974
Late in the night, I
still get flashbacks

35:34.007 --> 35:35.779
of Pastor Frank in my bedroom

35:35.813 --> 35:38.453
and see his face
floating around me.

35:38.486 --> 35:41.395
I have difficulties being in
the presence of elderly men.

35:41.428 --> 35:43.870
I also have difficulty in
being intimate with my wife.

35:43.904 --> 35:45.575
(tense music continues)

35:45.608 --> 35:47.982
I can't relate to
my own children.

35:48.016 --> 35:49.922
I find it awkward
to hug my own sons

35:49.955 --> 35:51.458
because I don't want
them getting used

35:51.492 --> 35:53.967
to another male hugging them.
(tense music continues)

35:54.000 --> 35:57.644
- [Beckett] Your father
admitted to one act

35:57.678 --> 36:00.519
or act on one occasion, I
think you said a one off.

36:00.553 --> 36:02.124
- No, I think was
one act, one off.

36:02.158 --> 36:05.534
One-off act, I think he said.
(tense music continues)

36:05.568 --> 36:08.109
- Brian Houston's always
said, "That's what I was told.

36:08.142 --> 36:09.079
That's what I believed.

36:09.112 --> 36:11.151
I didn't know anything else."

36:11.185 --> 36:14.796
But Assemblies of God had
access to all the people

36:14.830 --> 36:16.200
and all the records.
(tense music continues)

36:16.233 --> 36:19.745
And if I found all of
these cases of sexual abuse

36:19.778 --> 36:21.917
by Frank Houston without those,

36:23.622 --> 36:25.527
I can't imagine how
many they would find.

36:26.766 --> 36:27.466
(no audio)

36:30.242 --> 36:32.884
(somber music)

36:38.132 --> 36:40.472
As I was looking
through Frank's life

36:40.505 --> 36:42.981
and trying to step
back through the years,

36:43.014 --> 36:45.487
I sought out Salvation Army.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.093
(somber music continues)

36:47.126 --> 36:51.505
And I said, "I know he was
working at Temuka boys' home.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.886
Was there anything on your files
or anything on your records

36:55.919 --> 36:58.126
that indicated
something untoward?

36:58.159 --> 36:59.563
(somber music continues)

36:59.597 --> 37:03.107
Now, I couldn't believe
it when they came back

37:03.141 --> 37:05.816
and said there was an allegation

37:05.849 --> 37:09.292
of sexual offending against
children by Frank Houston

37:09.325 --> 37:11.098
when he was at
Temuka boys' home.

37:11.131 --> 37:14.642
(somber music continues)

37:17.751 --> 37:20.828
At that point, Frank Houston
would've been in his early 20s.

37:20.861 --> 37:22.298
(somber music continues)

37:22.331 --> 37:23.970
But whatever happened

37:24.003 --> 37:27.815
in the Salvation Army never
seems to be properly addressed.

37:27.849 --> 37:31.125
(somber music continues)

37:32.294 --> 37:34.334
Frank Houston,
throughout his career,

37:34.367 --> 37:35.738
would take his ministry

37:35.772 --> 37:38.680
into the poorer
parts of New Zealand

37:38.714 --> 37:41.790
and across the Pacific to
very poor Pacific islands.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.027
(tense music continues)

37:43.060 --> 37:44.732
- [Frank] It's been my
privilege in my lifetime

37:44.765 --> 37:46.638
to travel around the
world preaching the gospel

37:46.671 --> 37:47.774
in many countries.

37:48.811 --> 37:50.918
And I have actually preached

37:50.951 --> 37:54.695
to the red, the yellow,
the black, and the white.

37:54.728 --> 37:57.303
I've preached to the Maoris
all over New Zealand.

37:57.336 --> 37:58.640
(somber music continues)

37:58.674 --> 38:01.951
(water whooshing)

38:01.984 --> 38:06.296
- I've no doubt whatsoever that
when Frank Houston traveled,

38:06.330 --> 38:08.336
he sought out victims.

38:08.369 --> 38:11.378
(somber music continues)
(keys tapping)

38:11.411 --> 38:13.819
What we know now, looking back,

38:13.853 --> 38:18.032
that period from 1945
through to 1975 is filled

38:18.065 --> 38:22.812
with enough allegations of
sexual violence against children

38:22.846 --> 38:27.727
to conceive of Frank Houston
as a lifelong predator.

38:29.032 --> 38:32.441
We're talking at
the least 30 years

38:32.474 --> 38:34.883
of sexual offending
against children.

38:34.916 --> 38:39.797
(somber music continues)
(keys tapping)

38:43.507 --> 38:46.416
(plane whooshing)

38:47.854 --> 38:48.892
- [Beckett] Let's
move onto the meeting

38:48.925 --> 38:52.769
of special executive on
the 22nd of December, 1999.

38:52.802 --> 38:55.076
You know the meeting
at Sydney Airport

38:55.110 --> 38:56.916
that I'm referring to?
- Yes.

38:56.949 --> 38:59.823
(tense music)

38:59.857 --> 39:04.070
- So in December, 1999, there's
an emergency AOG meeting

39:04.103 --> 39:06.109
in the Qantas Lounge
at Sydney Airport.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.015
(tense music continues)

39:08.049 --> 39:12.094
Brian is there as both the
investigator of the case

39:12.127 --> 39:14.835
and the son of the
accused abuser,

39:14.868 --> 39:16.976
and he's at the helm
of the narrative.

39:17.009 --> 39:17.911
- I told them the story.

39:17.945 --> 39:19.883
I burst into tears, sobbed.

39:19.918 --> 39:21.355
There was no way I could
chair that meeting,

39:21.388 --> 39:24.430
because I was a mess.
(tense music continues)

39:24.464 --> 39:27.272
- The way that Brian
frames these allegations

39:27.306 --> 39:29.546
for the other members of the AOG

39:29.580 --> 39:31.886
is the same way that
Frank framed it for him.

39:31.919 --> 39:34.862
One victim in New
Zealand 35 years ago.

39:34.895 --> 39:37.336
- I told them everything
I knew, I think,

39:37.369 --> 39:39.843
in terms of the fondling,

39:39.877 --> 39:42.351
you know, the nature
of it at that level.

39:44.993 --> 39:48.469
- What's really significant
there is that, at that meeting,

39:48.502 --> 39:51.646
there were 10, 12
leading figures

39:51.679 --> 39:53.250
of Pentecostal
churches in Australia.

39:53.284 --> 39:54.888
(tense music continues)

39:54.922 --> 39:58.099
This group of men who
knew the Houstons well

39:58.132 --> 40:02.411
decided amongst themselves
that what Frank Houston did

40:02.444 --> 40:04.384
was a moral transgression,

40:04.417 --> 40:07.159
not a serious criminal offense.

40:07.192 --> 40:09.198
- So the various times I spoke,

40:09.232 --> 40:11.505
the wording wouldn't have
been exactly the same.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.049
And it's possible that
the weakest of those,

40:15.083 --> 40:18.259
I might've said the
words moral failure.

40:18.292 --> 40:19.930
(tense music continues)

40:19.963 --> 40:22.204
- This wasn't a
spiritual failing.

40:22.237 --> 40:26.985
This was a series of violent
criminal acts against children,

40:27.019 --> 40:28.924
and the church knew
about it and did nothing.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.669
(tense music)

40:32.702 --> 40:35.143
- [Alex] The AOG decides
not to go to the police.

40:35.176 --> 40:36.714
Frank's credentials
are not revoked.

40:36.747 --> 40:38.653
The matter is not
to be made public.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.425
- That's the Hillsong playbook.

40:40.458 --> 40:43.434
If someone complains,
you diminish it.

40:43.467 --> 40:44.303
They're an irritant.
(tense music continues)

40:44.337 --> 40:48.182
Maybe you order a
confidential inquiry.

40:48.215 --> 40:49.586
The information goes no further.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.294
It's held in a small
group of people.

40:52.327 --> 40:55.370
Whoever the victim is has to go.

40:55.403 --> 40:56.406
(tense music continues)

40:56.439 --> 40:58.547
- [AHA] I eventually
agreed to meet Pastor Frank

40:58.580 --> 41:00.586
on or about early 2000.

41:00.619 --> 41:03.360
The meeting was held at
McDonald's restaurant

41:03.394 --> 41:06.403
of Thornleigh just up
Pennant Hills Road.

41:06.436 --> 41:08.108
(tense music continues)

41:08.142 --> 41:12.454
- What did Pastor Frank want
from you during that meeting?

41:13.792 --> 41:14.595
- [AHA] He wanted
me to forgive him.

41:14.628 --> 41:16.132
- [Beckett] You
were asked to sign

41:16.166 --> 41:18.539
a food-stained
napkin, is that right?

41:18.573 --> 41:19.810
- [AHA] Yes.
(tense music continues)

41:19.843 --> 41:21.582
Words were said to
the following effect.

41:21.616 --> 41:25.326
"If you put your
signature there, I'll
give you the 10,000."

41:25.360 --> 41:27.232
And at that stage, sir,
I just wanna tell you

41:27.266 --> 41:28.637
that I was in a state of panic.

41:28.670 --> 41:30.275
I just scribbled my name on it,

41:30.308 --> 41:33.250
and Frank kept badgering
me about the forgiveness.

41:33.284 --> 41:34.353
(tense music continues)

41:34.387 --> 41:36.092
About two months
after my meeting

41:36.126 --> 41:39.535
with Pastor Frank at McDonald's,
I telephoned Brian Houston

41:39.570 --> 41:43.548
as I had not yet received
any money from Pastor Frank.

41:43.582 --> 41:45.654
We had a conversation
to the following effect.

41:45.688 --> 41:47.392
(tense music continues)

41:47.426 --> 41:50.603
Me, "What's happening with
the payment I was promised?

41:50.636 --> 41:53.143
I agreed to forgive
your father."

41:53.177 --> 41:57.624
Brian, "Yes, okay, I'll
get the money to you.

41:57.657 --> 42:00.531
There's no problem.
(tense music continues)

42:00.566 --> 42:03.474
You know, it's your fault
all of this happened.

42:03.507 --> 42:04.778
You tempted my father."

42:04.811 --> 42:09.158
(tense music continues)

42:09.191 --> 42:11.699
- Shortly after
the $10,000 payout,

42:11.732 --> 42:13.137
Brian Houston really starts

42:13.170 --> 42:16.179
with a pretty vigorous
rebranding effort.

42:16.212 --> 42:17.583
- It's a church
growing so quickly

42:17.617 --> 42:20.626
that buildings struggle
to contain the increase.

42:20.659 --> 42:23.233
- Christian Life Centre
is renamed Hillsong,

42:23.267 --> 42:25.708
and the Assemblies
of God is relabeled

42:25.741 --> 42:27.814
as the Australian
Christian Churches.

42:27.847 --> 42:29.285
(tense music continues)

42:29.318 --> 42:31.625
Brian has really done
everything he can

42:31.659 --> 42:33.464
to really kind of
parse his words

42:33.497 --> 42:36.272
and manipulate, you
know, meaning and syntax

42:36.306 --> 42:39.883
to say the abuse didn't
happen at Hillsong,

42:39.916 --> 42:41.756
it happened at
Christian Life Centres.

42:41.789 --> 42:44.598
And it's sort of
apropos of nothing.

42:47.472 --> 42:49.980
- When these things happened,
Hillsong didn't exist at all.

42:50.013 --> 42:51.886
It was long before
Hillsong existed.

42:51.919 --> 42:53.524
This was not about Hillsong.

42:53.558 --> 42:55.697
This was not about the
Australian Assemblies of God.

42:55.731 --> 42:59.743
This payment was
between Frank and AHA.

43:02.985 --> 43:04.089
- [AHA] No one
believed my story,

43:04.122 --> 43:07.499
and others put pressure on
me to keep my mouth shut.

43:07.532 --> 43:10.909
I felt that the
church's response was
completely inadequate,

43:10.943 --> 43:13.585
and I have received
absolutely no support,

43:13.618 --> 43:17.630
no counseling, apology, or
acknowledgement of the abuse.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.505
(eerie music)

43:20.538 --> 43:23.648
- That same year,
2000, at a conference,

43:23.681 --> 43:25.587
Frank Houston is
wheeled out onstage

43:25.621 --> 43:28.563
and the Hillsong pastor
announces, and I'm reading here,

43:28.596 --> 43:31.672
"Here's a great man and
a great apostle of faith.

43:31.705 --> 43:33.443
Let's all stand and honor him."

43:33.477 --> 43:36.720
And the whole congregation
rises to their feet,

43:36.754 --> 43:38.927
and they applaud
Frank Houston wildly.

43:38.960 --> 43:40.531
(eerie music continues)
(congregation clapping)

43:40.566 --> 43:42.805
This is an admitted pedophile.

43:42.839 --> 43:44.443
This is, like, a child rapist.

43:46.951 --> 43:49.893
Like...
(eerie music continues)

43:49.926 --> 43:54.340
By December of 2000, the AOG
New Zealand has allegations

43:54.373 --> 43:57.349
from six alleged
victims of child abuse

43:57.382 --> 43:59.956
at the hands of Frank Houston.
(eerie music continues)

43:59.990 --> 44:01.929
- It's now impossible to ignore,

44:01.962 --> 44:05.373
and so they had to take
action against Frank Houston.

44:05.406 --> 44:08.047
And they quietly
shuffled him sideways

44:08.080 --> 44:10.388
and agreed to not
tell anybody about it.

44:10.421 --> 44:11.892
(eerie music continues)

44:11.926 --> 44:14.132
- From the time these
exposes started coming out

44:14.165 --> 44:17.074
in late 1999 to 2004,

44:18.512 --> 44:20.552
I think probably
because of the stress

44:20.586 --> 44:22.490
and the pain of all of
this and the humiliation,

44:22.524 --> 44:26.101
my father deteriorated
very quickly into dementia.

44:26.134 --> 44:30.013
So month by month, year
by year, he got worse.

44:30.046 --> 44:31.819
(eerie music continues)

44:31.852 --> 44:34.561
- Now, the diagnosis with
dementia is significant

44:34.594 --> 44:36.031
because it means

44:36.064 --> 44:37.870
that Frank can't answer
for any alleged abuses.

44:37.903 --> 44:39.107
(eerie music continues)

44:39.140 --> 44:41.682
Coincidentally, that
diagnosis is provided

44:41.715 --> 44:43.688
by a guy named Dr. Gordon Lee

44:43.721 --> 44:46.697
who served for 22 years as
a board member at Hillsong.

44:46.730 --> 44:49.538
(eerie music continues)

44:49.572 --> 44:51.477
- There was an
extraordinary correspondence

44:51.511 --> 44:52.682
backward and forwards

44:52.715 --> 44:54.185
between the Australian
Assemblies of God

44:54.218 --> 44:56.224
and New Zealand
Assemblies of God

44:56.259 --> 44:59.636
that showed that
they tried to limit

44:59.669 --> 45:01.742
as much as they possibly could

45:01.775 --> 45:04.951
any knowledge of Frank
Houston's sexual offending.

45:04.985 --> 45:09.866
We learned that they
had meetings about
not telling anyone.

45:10.736 --> 45:12.172
(eerie music continues)

45:12.206 --> 45:15.215
They documented how they were
not going to tell anyone.

45:15.248 --> 45:17.288
They wrote a statement
that they then agreed

45:17.322 --> 45:19.562
they were not going
to release to anybody.

45:19.596 --> 45:21.300
(eerie music continues)

45:21.334 --> 45:23.172
It's the Assemblies
of God version

45:23.205 --> 45:24.911
of the Nixon White House tapes.

45:26.717 --> 45:29.993
- Confess your sin to the
Lord and He'll blot it out.

45:30.026 --> 45:32.099
(film reel clicking)

45:36.111 --> 45:39.087
(traffic whooshing)

45:39.120 --> 45:41.795
(somber music)

45:42.806 --> 45:44.602
- [Beckett] The main
person handling the matter

45:44.636 --> 45:48.748
for the Assemblies
of God was you.

45:48.781 --> 45:50.954
- Yes, trying to pull
in all the information

45:50.987 --> 45:52.693
so I could bring it to this-

45:52.726 --> 45:56.202
- [Beckett] You were the son
of the alleged perpetrator.

45:56.237 --> 45:57.841
- Yes, exactly.

45:57.875 --> 46:01.051
- [Beckett] How did you
expect that to be received?

46:01.084 --> 46:02.623
- I understand
what you're saying.

46:03.959 --> 46:05.699
The whole idea of a
conflict of interest,

46:05.732 --> 46:07.771
to be honest, hadn't
even occurred to me

46:07.805 --> 46:09.811
and was never suggested
by anyone else

46:09.844 --> 46:11.650
until we got here
to the commission.

46:11.683 --> 46:14.123
I saw it as me being in a role,

46:14.156 --> 46:17.835
having to make tough
decisions and having the guts

46:17.868 --> 46:20.108
or the courage to make
those tough decisions.

46:20.141 --> 46:21.580
No matter what any
paperwork says,

46:21.613 --> 46:23.284
no matter whatever else happens,

46:23.318 --> 46:26.226
I knew he would never preach
again from that moment.

46:27.765 --> 46:29.604
- The idea that Frank
never preached again,

46:30.807 --> 46:34.585
that's not true.
(somber music continues)

46:34.619 --> 46:36.122
- I remember when I
heard that audio in 2004

46:36.156 --> 46:37.561
where he was still preaching,

46:40.001 --> 46:40.970
that was chilling.

46:41.004 --> 46:43.746
That was really,
really chilling.

46:43.779 --> 46:44.882
- [Frank] What a wonderful joy

46:44.916 --> 46:46.287
just to be in
church this morning.

46:46.320 --> 46:47.290
- [Congregation] Yes.

46:47.323 --> 46:48.727
- [Frank] Look at me today.

46:50.064 --> 46:54.277
Nothing can separate you
from the love of God.

46:55.782 --> 46:57.085
- [Alex] We heard from
former congregants,

46:57.119 --> 46:59.927
some of whom wanted
to remain anonymous.

46:59.961 --> 47:01.231
I understand that you were close

47:01.264 --> 47:05.176
with Frank and Hazel
Houston in 2000, 2004.

47:05.209 --> 47:08.788
- [Interviewee] Yeah, the last
years of their lives, really.

47:08.821 --> 47:10.794
All we were told
is they were sent

47:10.827 --> 47:13.233
to the Central Coast to retire.

47:13.267 --> 47:14.939
(somber music continues)

47:14.972 --> 47:16.878
- [Frank] God's got a
purpose for your life.

47:18.115 --> 47:20.957
God has got a purpose
for your life.

47:22.996 --> 47:24.669
- [Interviewee] I
never heard a word

47:24.702 --> 47:27.108
about them being stood down.
(somber music continues)

47:27.142 --> 47:29.114
They were like royalty.

47:29.148 --> 47:32.290
They had their own parking spot
out the front of the church,

47:32.325 --> 47:34.230
and their names
were on a plaque.

47:34.263 --> 47:35.835
(somber music continues)

47:35.869 --> 47:37.741
- [Frank] And the
little boy back there,

47:37.774 --> 47:40.984
two little boys, one
bigger than the other,

47:41.017 --> 47:43.859
but God's got a purpose
for their lives.

47:43.893 --> 47:45.364
- [Alex] You had young
kids at the time, right?

47:46.735 --> 47:48.171
(somber music continues)

47:48.205 --> 47:51.850
- [Interviewee] He used to
tell my son, who was 10,

47:51.883 --> 47:54.323
"You look like you're
a million bucks."

47:54.357 --> 47:56.731
And you know what, if
I knew what I knew now,

47:57.901 --> 47:59.339
I would've punched
him in the face.

47:59.372 --> 48:01.177
(somber music continues)

48:01.210 --> 48:02.783
- [Frank] What a fantastic
young fellow he is.

48:02.816 --> 48:05.323
Curly hair, sort of.

48:05.357 --> 48:06.326
Good looking.

48:06.360 --> 48:08.031
(somber music continues)

48:08.065 --> 48:09.168
It's not your fault
you're good looking,

48:10.137 --> 48:11.140
so thank God you are.

48:13.113 --> 48:15.488
- [Interviewee] Never, never
in a million years did I think

48:15.521 --> 48:18.797
that myself and my
son were standing

48:18.831 --> 48:21.806
in front of a
pedophile, a sex abuser

48:21.840 --> 48:26.219
who had actually abused
other children at that age.

48:26.252 --> 48:27.122
(somber music continues)

48:27.155 --> 48:28.494
- [Frank] By the grace of God,

48:28.527 --> 48:31.836
I'm still vibrant on the inside.

48:31.870 --> 48:35.380
I'm still alive with the
Holy Ghost on the inside.

48:35.414 --> 48:36.985
(somber music continues)

48:37.018 --> 48:40.496
- [Interviewee] Like,
I just can't understand

48:40.530 --> 48:44.975
that you would allow someone
to be in that environment.

48:45.009 --> 48:47.015
There was children
there every week.

48:47.048 --> 48:48.520
What the hell?

48:48.554 --> 48:53.535
(somber music continues)
(film reel clicking)

48:53.569 --> 48:55.441
- For years, I
would go to church

48:55.475 --> 48:58.884
and I would try
to immerse myself

48:58.917 --> 49:00.287
in everything
going on around me,

49:00.321 --> 49:02.027
but I'd continue to
get these thoughts.

49:02.060 --> 49:04.434
This is rubbish.
This isn't true.

49:04.468 --> 49:06.407
And through the grapevine,

49:06.441 --> 49:09.081
I found out that there was
gonna be an announcement

49:09.114 --> 49:11.589
about Frank Houston.
(somber music continues)

49:11.623 --> 49:14.196
- So I was Brian's intern.

49:15.501 --> 49:17.607
Obviously super close
with Ben and Joel.

49:17.641 --> 49:20.047
I was at their house when all
that stuff kinda went down.

49:20.081 --> 49:22.456
I remember Brian
talking about it

49:24.259 --> 49:26.199
and what he was gonna have
to do, to tell the church.

49:26.232 --> 49:27.471
(ominous music)

49:27.504 --> 49:29.174
- My own father,
who was my hero,

49:31.147 --> 49:35.359
was accused of sexual abuse.

49:35.392 --> 49:36.329
It was like

49:38.001 --> 49:41.110
jets flying into the
Twin Towers of my soul.

49:41.144 --> 49:44.019
(ominous music continues)

49:44.052 --> 49:46.292
But the reason
why I'm still here

49:46.325 --> 49:49.134
and the reason why I still
believe in the power of God

49:49.168 --> 49:51.374
and still love to see
people transformed

49:51.407 --> 49:54.383
through Jesus Christ is
because that still looks right.

49:54.416 --> 49:56.088
What God says still looks right.

49:56.122 --> 49:57.961
(congregation clapping)

49:57.994 --> 49:58.997
Praise God.

49:59.031 --> 50:02.373
(congregation clapping)

50:02.407 --> 50:04.648
- All these people stood
up and applauded him.

50:06.185 --> 50:08.024
I thought, 12,000
people are wrong.

50:08.058 --> 50:10.030
That was the last time
I went to Hillsong,

50:10.064 --> 50:13.139
and that was the last time I
was afraid of going to hell,

50:13.173 --> 50:15.581
because if it's
between me and the guy

50:15.615 --> 50:18.188
that's apparently covering
up for the pedophile,

50:18.221 --> 50:22.702
then I'll stand by me.
(ominous music continues)

50:24.239 --> 50:26.581
After that, I felt like
I had a responsibility

50:26.614 --> 50:29.690
to just raise awareness,
to let people know

50:29.723 --> 50:31.729
that they weren't
everything that they seemed.

50:31.763 --> 50:35.575
(ominous music continues)

50:35.608 --> 50:38.482
- Frank dies in 2004 without
being convicted of any crime.

50:38.517 --> 50:39.587
(ominous music continues)

50:39.620 --> 50:43.464
The police were never
contacted by Brian or the AOG.

50:43.498 --> 50:45.538
Brian's excuse was
that he didn't know

50:45.571 --> 50:47.375
that he had to
contact the police.

50:47.408 --> 50:48.780
(ominous music continues)

50:48.814 --> 50:50.820
In fact, however, it
was revealed later

50:50.853 --> 50:52.491
that Brian had
sought legal counsel

50:52.525 --> 50:54.832
on the matter at least twice.
(ominous music continues)

50:54.865 --> 50:58.141
He knew that if he brought
the matter to the police,

50:58.174 --> 50:59.445
his father could have
been incarcerated

50:59.479 --> 51:01.753
and his church would
have been disgraced.

51:01.786 --> 51:04.662
(ominous music continues)

51:04.695 --> 51:06.534
- When I was at the
Royal Commission,

51:06.567 --> 51:09.408
it was very interesting hearing
Brian Houston's testimony.

51:09.442 --> 51:13.420
The majority of his statements
just didn't line up,

51:13.454 --> 51:15.527
and I think it was like

51:15.561 --> 51:17.567
there were too many
cracks in the damn wall.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.171
(ominous music continues)

51:19.204 --> 51:20.174
- [Prosecutor] Mr. Houston,
can I suggest to you

51:20.207 --> 51:22.347
that the inconsistencies
and errors

51:22.380 --> 51:23.819
in your statement
were deliberate?

51:25.624 --> 51:26.493
(ominous music continues)
- Why would I admit it,

51:26.526 --> 51:28.331
why would I bring it up here,

51:28.365 --> 51:29.603
if it was deliberate?
- Mr. Houston,

51:29.636 --> 51:31.340
I'm just making a
suggestion to you.

51:31.374 --> 51:32.579
- If it was deliberate that I
was trying to hide something.

51:32.612 --> 51:35.185
I mean, the truth is, I didn't
have to talk about it at all.

51:35.219 --> 51:36.691
I spoke about it

51:36.724 --> 51:39.867
because I'm saying I had
completely forgotten this

51:39.900 --> 51:41.471
and now I remember,

51:41.505 --> 51:44.346
so I'm telling the commission
this is what I remember.

51:44.379 --> 51:46.721
- [Prosecutor] Thank
you. Nothing further.

51:46.754 --> 51:50.197
(ominous music continues)

51:54.242 --> 51:57.385
(ominous music continues)

52:03.731 --> 52:06.252
- Typically the way that
Hillsong has handled scandal,

52:06.285 --> 52:07.657
because I've been a part of it,

52:07.691 --> 52:10.532
was what looks best
for the church.

52:10.565 --> 52:11.803
(somber music)
But most of the time,

52:11.836 --> 52:14.276
it serves everybody to
push everything down.

52:14.309 --> 52:16.785
You just push it as far
under the rug as you can.

52:16.818 --> 52:19.727
We choose narrative over truth,

52:19.760 --> 52:21.598
and that leads to
absolute disaster

52:21.633 --> 52:22.836
because the truth
doesn't go anywhere

52:22.869 --> 52:24.875
just because you cover it up.

52:24.909 --> 52:27.450
- The Royal Commission's
report has now published.

52:27.483 --> 52:30.024
It's online, I encourage
everyone to read it.

52:30.057 --> 52:32.363
- [Reporter] 17
shameful volumes.

52:32.397 --> 52:35.842
"It is a national tragedy
perpetrated over generations."

52:35.875 --> 52:38.315
- If you read the report
of the Royal Commission,

52:38.348 --> 52:40.321
it's pretty clear what happened.

52:40.354 --> 52:42.696
The church had known
about the abuse

52:42.729 --> 52:44.601
for more than a
decade and a half,

52:44.635 --> 52:46.975
and the church had told nobody.

52:47.008 --> 52:48.345
(tense music)

52:48.378 --> 52:51.923
Here is a modern
abusive institution

52:51.956 --> 52:56.335
which the Royal Commission
had just exposed.

52:56.369 --> 52:58.944
(tense music continues)

52:58.977 --> 53:00.515
This material is out there.

53:00.549 --> 53:01.753
The police have it.

53:03.558 --> 53:05.029
Time for some action.
(tense music continues)

53:05.062 --> 53:07.971
- The Australian government
and this parliament,

53:08.004 --> 53:11.816
on behalf of all Australians,
unreservedly apologizes

53:11.849 --> 53:13.922
to the victims and survivors

53:13.956 --> 53:16.731
of institutional
child sexual abuse.

53:18.469 --> 53:21.913
- It soon became apparent
that nothing was happening.

53:21.946 --> 53:22.816
(dramatic music)

53:22.849 --> 53:23.685
- We are sorry.

53:24.855 --> 53:26.928
- This gross, gross failure

53:26.961 --> 53:28.666
just kind of
dropped into a hole.

53:30.170 --> 53:32.679
There's no institutional
explanation for this delay.

53:32.712 --> 53:35.119
This isn't a hugely
complicated case.

53:35.152 --> 53:36.991
(dramatic music continues)

53:37.025 --> 53:38.964
This isn't some kind
of international
drug smuggling ring.

53:40.736 --> 53:42.508
So the question was, well,
where are the police?

53:42.541 --> 53:45.450
(dramatic music continues)

53:45.483 --> 53:48.694
(church bell ringing)

53:52.170 --> 53:56.483
- When Frank Houston died, a
remarkable scene played out.

53:56.516 --> 53:58.489
The next New South Wales
Police Commissioner

53:58.522 --> 54:01.766
attended Frank Houston's
funeral as a mark of respect.

54:03.069 --> 54:04.908
That police commissioner
called Andrew Scipione

54:04.942 --> 54:07.917
himself is a
Hillsong congregant.

54:07.951 --> 54:09.522
(tense music)
- Post royal commission,

54:09.555 --> 54:13.935
we still had very senior
members of the state government,

54:13.969 --> 54:16.844
including the former
police commissioner,

54:16.878 --> 54:19.051
very, very closely connected
with this institution

54:19.084 --> 54:20.522
as though nothing had happened.

54:20.555 --> 54:22.193
(tense music continues)

54:22.226 --> 54:23.965
- Perhaps it's coincidence,

54:23.999 --> 54:27.576
but for the duration of
Commissioner Scipione's time

54:27.609 --> 54:29.950
running the New
South Wales Police,

54:29.983 --> 54:31.588
there was no effective
investigation

54:31.621 --> 54:33.527
into Brian Houston or Hillsong.

54:33.561 --> 54:34.932
(tense music continues)

54:34.965 --> 54:37.573
As a journalist,
this is a moment

54:37.606 --> 54:39.847
that is really worth untangling.

54:39.880 --> 54:40.983
(tense music continues)

54:41.016 --> 54:43.256
- Hillsong followers are rife

54:43.289 --> 54:45.162
throughout Australian politics,

54:45.195 --> 54:47.268
throughout the Australian
public service,

54:47.301 --> 54:48.739
especially within the police.

54:48.774 --> 54:49.642
(tense music continues)

54:49.675 --> 54:51.113
- And it turns out that in fact,

54:51.147 --> 54:52.986
part of the church's
business model was

54:53.019 --> 54:56.730
to put its supporters in
positions of power and authority

54:56.764 --> 54:58.268
and look for people in
positions of power and authority

54:58.301 --> 55:00.274
and make them their supporters.

55:00.307 --> 55:03.651
And it had been extremely
successful in doing that.

55:03.684 --> 55:06.726
In a few short decades,
Hillsong had managed

55:06.760 --> 55:10.137
to capture a fairly big
chunk of Australian politics.

55:10.170 --> 55:13.581
(tense music continues)

55:17.091 --> 55:18.830
- The fact that
Frank has passed away

55:18.864 --> 55:21.036
has made it extremely difficult

55:21.070 --> 55:24.848
to make any progress in
terms of pursuing justice.

55:24.882 --> 55:28.827
(tense music continues)

55:28.860 --> 55:30.966
I don't know that
there's any way

55:31.000 --> 55:33.707
to compensate for
what's happened,

55:33.741 --> 55:35.345
and I don't think
money's gonna do it.

55:35.379 --> 55:38.354
(melancholy music)

55:38.388 --> 55:40.762
It's all the lost opportunities.

55:43.872 --> 55:44.842
It's still there.

55:44.875 --> 55:47.215
I still feel a degree of shame.

55:47.248 --> 55:48.686
Not okay.

55:48.719 --> 55:49.755
Don't quite measure up.

55:49.789 --> 55:51.728
(melancholy music continues)

55:51.761 --> 55:53.399
Not a whole person.

55:53.433 --> 55:54.704
Slightly broken.

55:56.408 --> 55:59.953
Every part of my life
has been impacted.

56:00.890 --> 56:02.761
(melancholy music continues)

56:02.794 --> 56:04.165
I just saw no hope.

56:04.199 --> 56:06.908
(melancholy music continues)

56:06.941 --> 56:09.448
Without the support
of my wife and family,

56:09.482 --> 56:11.287
I wouldn't be here today.

56:11.320 --> 56:14.965
(melancholy music continues)

56:17.840 --> 56:18.308
(no audio)

56:21.484 --> 56:24.025
(tense music)

56:29.211 --> 56:30.825
- Not only was there this delay,

56:30.858 --> 56:33.499
but there was also
very close associations

56:33.533 --> 56:35.070
between the Hillsong leadership

56:35.104 --> 56:38.247
and the then Australian
political leadership,

56:38.281 --> 56:40.487
and we just got stonewalled.
(tense music continues)

56:40.520 --> 56:43.128
All these institutional
barriers started going up.

56:43.162 --> 56:44.767
Well, that gets my
hackles up, to be honest.

56:44.800 --> 56:47.508
(tense music continues)

56:47.541 --> 56:51.386
Thankfully, we had a survivor

56:51.420 --> 56:54.295
who was not willing to let it go

56:54.329 --> 56:57.136
and had the courage and
the emotional strength

56:57.171 --> 57:00.580
to speak to a national
audience and demand action.

57:01.751 --> 57:03.556
- My name's Brett Sengstock.

57:03.589 --> 57:05.662
I appeared at the Royal
Commission as AHA.

57:06.866 --> 57:08.103
That was my pseudonym,

57:09.340 --> 57:12.616
and I now stand before you

57:12.650 --> 57:13.787
with who I really am.

57:14.622 --> 57:16.295
(melancholy music)

57:16.328 --> 57:18.367
- When Brett spoke
to "60 Minutes"

57:18.401 --> 57:23.282
he changed from being an acronym
in a block of text to being

57:24.753 --> 57:29.300
this compelling, powerful,
brave human being.

57:30.437 --> 57:31.606
(somber music)

57:31.640 --> 57:33.612
- I'm tired of people
speaking for me

57:33.646 --> 57:38.561
and telling the world how I
felt and how I am feeling.

57:38.594 --> 57:40.200
Now I'm telling the world
how I really do feel.

57:40.233 --> 57:42.406
- And how is that?
(somber music continues)

57:42.439 --> 57:43.174
- Pretty annoyed.

57:45.248 --> 57:45.916
Pretty annoyed.

57:46.853 --> 57:49.627
And I'm not going away just yet.

57:49.660 --> 57:50.630
(somber music continues)

57:50.663 --> 57:52.236
- Neither Brian Houston

57:52.269 --> 57:54.242
or any of the Hillsong
Church's leaders

57:54.275 --> 57:56.448
have faced any
legal repercussions

57:56.481 --> 57:59.323
for their failure to report
an indictable offense.

57:59.357 --> 58:01.964
It's now 49 years since
the abuse started,

58:01.998 --> 58:04.807
and 19 years since Brian
Houston was aware of it,

58:04.840 --> 58:07.281
and three years after the
Royal Commission delivered

58:07.314 --> 58:09.554
its damning report, yet
nothing has happened.

58:09.587 --> 58:10.891
(somber music continues)

58:10.925 --> 58:13.699
Brett Sengstock has
contacted my office for help.

58:13.734 --> 58:15.840
He is suffering from a
life-threatening illness,

58:15.873 --> 58:17.277
and he is concerned justice

58:17.311 --> 58:18.982
will not be served
in his lifetime.

58:19.015 --> 58:22.493
That would be a further
obscene betrayal.

58:22.526 --> 58:24.699
While Brett's
waiting for justice,

58:24.733 --> 58:29.045
we have the Trump administration
inviting Brian Houston

58:29.079 --> 58:31.854
to be his extra-special guest

58:31.888 --> 58:34.595
at a White House
reception in Washington.

58:34.629 --> 58:36.334
(somber music continues)

58:36.368 --> 58:37.003
- Well, what an honor to be
standing in the White House

58:37.036 --> 58:38.641
in the Cabinet Room,

58:38.674 --> 58:41.751
and to have just had the chance
to pray for President Trump.

58:41.784 --> 58:44.358
- It's a fact that Brian
Houston is a close friend

58:44.392 --> 58:46.030
of the prime minister,
Scott Morrison.

58:46.063 --> 58:49.005
- What this country needs more
than that is the love of God.

58:49.039 --> 58:50.778
(congregation clapping)

58:50.811 --> 58:53.017
- I just want to guarantee you

58:53.051 --> 58:55.692
that we will be praying for you.

58:55.726 --> 58:58.567
And praying for you not
just now, but consistently.

58:58.601 --> 59:00.105
(congregation clapping)

59:00.138 --> 59:02.646
- No one, regardless
of their friends,

59:02.679 --> 59:04.084
should be beyond the
reach of the law.

59:04.117 --> 59:05.522
(somber music continues)

59:05.555 --> 59:08.062
- I want my husband
to have justice.

59:08.096 --> 59:10.703
He deserves it.
(somber music continues)

59:10.738 --> 59:15.485
- To go on national TV as a
survivor of child sex abuse

59:15.518 --> 59:19.697
and to demand your
measure of justice,

59:19.731 --> 59:23.442
that is the work that finally
pushes institutions to act.

59:23.475 --> 59:24.445
(somber music continues)

59:24.478 --> 59:25.950
There is compelling evidence

59:25.983 --> 59:28.691
that Brian Houston knew
while he was a church leader

59:28.724 --> 59:31.098
about the abuse, about
the hush payments,

59:31.131 --> 59:32.837
and that he failed
to tell the police.

59:32.870 --> 59:34.107
This is a crime.

59:34.140 --> 59:35.043
(somber music continues)

59:35.077 --> 59:36.749
- [Announcer] A key question,

59:36.782 --> 59:40.192
when did he first learn of
those allegations of abuse?

59:40.225 --> 59:41.663
- [Reporter 1] Now,
amidst this turmoil

59:41.696 --> 59:43.067
in church leadership,

59:43.101 --> 59:45.608
an early leader of
Hillsong has come forward.

59:45.642 --> 59:47.749
- [Reporter 2] Brian
Houston categorically denies

59:47.782 --> 59:50.022
knowing any claims of
sexual abuse by his father

59:50.055 --> 59:53.632
before 1999, but Bullock
says Houston knew

59:53.666 --> 59:55.906
of allegations by his
father years earlier.

59:57.043 --> 01:00:01.088
- I do know that
Frank was outed,

01:00:01.121 --> 01:00:02.961
because Brian told
me in the early 90s.

01:00:02.994 --> 01:00:05.200
(somber music continues)

01:00:05.233 --> 01:00:08.510
I should've said something
and done something long ago.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:15.030
Not only wasn't Brian
accountable, but neither was I.

01:00:15.899 --> 01:00:18.640
(somber music continues)

01:00:21.248 --> 01:00:24.090
- It was only after that New
South Wales Police Commissioner

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:27.802
departed the scene in 2019

01:00:27.835 --> 01:00:31.947
that the police began a real
investigation of Brian Houston.

01:00:31.981 --> 01:00:33.619
(somber music continues)

01:00:33.652 --> 01:00:37.229
- December, 2021, a year
after Carl is banished,

01:00:37.263 --> 01:00:39.102
Brian Houston is
indicted in Australia

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.612
for allegedly covering for
his father being a pedophile.

01:00:42.646 --> 01:00:46.123
- Breaking news in relation
to a religious leader

01:00:46.156 --> 01:00:48.129
and a friend of the prime
minister who's being charged.

01:00:48.162 --> 01:00:50.636
- This is a New South
Wales Police statement.

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:52.141
A church leader is being charged

01:00:52.174 --> 01:00:53.612
over the alleged concealment

01:00:53.645 --> 01:00:55.585
of alleged child sex offenses.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.627
- You need to know that
there is an enemy out there,

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.599
and his intent is to defile you,

01:01:13.204 --> 01:01:15.645
and let's always remember
that when we see the church,

01:01:15.678 --> 01:01:19.055
His beautiful church
on the Earth, attacked.

01:01:19.088 --> 01:01:20.727
Royal commission week,

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:23.134
I have never felt so
exposed in my life,

01:01:23.167 --> 01:01:25.976
and I remember I didn't
know what to do but wait.

01:01:26.009 --> 01:01:27.012
And so all day, I waited.

01:01:27.046 --> 01:01:28.416
I went out.

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:30.757
I did a manicure, a
pedicure, and a massage

01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:33.097
'cause I wasn't ready
to back to my real world

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:34.702
which, gentlemen,
that's what you do.

01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:36.106
(congregation laughing)
(somber music continues)

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:40.954
It is no point any
of us wasting energy

01:01:40.988 --> 01:01:43.830
on how unfair this seems.

01:01:43.863 --> 01:01:47.173
Not the issue, but the
unfairness that, yet again,

01:01:47.206 --> 01:01:49.881
my husband's integrity
was about to be assailed.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:52.388
(somber music continues)

01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:53.559
- More than seven years

01:01:53.592 --> 01:01:57.436
since the Royal Commission
first detailed what happened,

01:01:57.470 --> 01:02:02.451
there is this chance,
this very real chance,

01:02:03.856 --> 01:02:05.494
for the courts to
deliver justice.

01:02:05.528 --> 01:02:06.664
- [Reporter 3] Houston is
facing serious jail time.

01:02:06.698 --> 01:02:11.144
- [Reporter 4] Fate of his
church in the hands of the law.

01:02:13.786 --> 01:02:15.893
(no audio)

01:02:22.211 --> 01:02:24.317

01:03:06.243 --> 01:03:09.252
(melancholy music)

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:18.981
(melancholy music continues)

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.610
(melancholy music continues)

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.667
(melancholy music continues)

01:03:36.701 --> 01:03:39.475
(no audio)

01:03:39.509 --> 01:03:42.418
(camera shutters clicking)

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:45.628
(bright music)

01:03:45.661 --> 01:03:48.302
(somber music)
